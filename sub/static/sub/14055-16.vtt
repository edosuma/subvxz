00:38.096 --> 00:39.648
It's hard to believe it,
but spring is here.

00:39.847 --> 00:41.787
Yep, this year's
just flying by.

00:41.966 --> 00:45.472
Yeah, and you know, I got to say,
this year, not as good as last.

00:45.664 --> 00:46.376
You think?

00:46.518 --> 00:49.860
I do. I mean, look. We all tried
some new things, and that was fun.

00:50.037 --> 00:54.582
Uh, yard guys, illegitimate daughters,
less fighting, more live music.

00:54.801 --> 00:57.629
Well, maybe you remember last year
as better, 'cause it was all new.

00:58.368 --> 01:01.409
So you think I've sentimentalized
the past all out of proportion?

01:01.526 --> 01:03.496
Yeah, come on, I mean, we
can't keep living in last year.

01:03.614 --> 01:05.215
Sure we can. And check this out, man.

01:05.730 --> 01:07.676
Things are already going
back to the way they were.

01:07.857 --> 01:09.986
I'm back together with Summer.
You're single again.

01:10.153 --> 01:12.319
- I think I know where this is going.
- I'll tell you where it's going.

01:12.404 --> 01:15.063
It's going to the Harbor
School Pep Rally Bonfire.

01:18.436 --> 01:19.334
Come on.

01:19.548 --> 01:21.292
You could rally a little
pep, couldn't you?

01:21.551 --> 01:23.519
- Especially if you invited...
- Don't say it.

01:23.642 --> 01:25.531
Aw, it would be
so last year though.

01:25.676 --> 01:27.221
- There's nothing going on with me and Marissa.
- Really?

01:27.338 --> 01:31.413
So, there's just no feelings there whatsoever?
You couldn't care less.

01:31.549 --> 01:36.788
It's not about that.
Besides, she's... clearly already taken.

01:39.685 --> 01:41.351
I don't know. I don't
see any chemistry there.

01:41.775 --> 01:44.792
Maybe we should ask them to kiss... real slow-like.

01:45.148 --> 01:48.274
Couldn't help but notice
the, uh, bonfire banner.

01:48.397 --> 01:50.773
Oh, don't talk to me about it.
It's been so stressful.

01:50.920 --> 01:52.823
I can't even find someone
to design the bonfire.

01:52.925 --> 01:56.408
- But you guys are coming, right?
- I don't know, it's a pep rally.

01:56.571 --> 01:58.185
Yeah,
a bonfire pep rally.

01:58.299 --> 02:00.435
- You bet we are.
- Okay, cool. Well,

02:00.557 --> 02:01.264
I'm gonna be late.

02:01.350 --> 02:03.827
Okay. Hey, Ryan, you're going
the way of lockers and classrooms.

02:03.912 --> 02:05.853
Why don't you walk her?
That'd be a nice gesture.

02:07.388 --> 02:10.080
- Okay. Thanks.
- No problem.

02:11.427 --> 02:15.051
- Live in the now, Seth.
- I'm sorry. I'm afraid. I can't do that.

02:19.579 --> 02:22.471
Don't even think
about it, Cohen.

02:22.665 --> 02:24.570
We have lived through enough
of their pain and suffering.

02:24.645 --> 02:27.611
- Yeah, and it was awesome.
- Do not meddle with Ryan and Marissa.

02:27.708 --> 02:32.436
- They're like combustible.
- Yeah, Summer, and what better place for said combustion,

02:33.131 --> 02:35.770
than the Harbor School
Pep Rally Bonfire?

02:41.015 --> 02:43.102
- You're kind of creeping me out.
- I'm okay wi th that.

02:44.905 --> 02:45.638
Wait. Summer.

03:24.541 --> 03:27.496
All right, nice and easy.
Now, start that shoulder turn.

03:28.141 --> 03:30.705
Keep your eye on that ball.
Maintain the spine angle.

03:30.893 --> 03:32.567
Come on, turn those shoulders.

03:32.695 --> 03:34.831
Finish that turn,feel that weight shift!
You feel the...

03:36.851 --> 03:39.120
All right, I'm just gonna stand here,
nice and quietly.

03:40.029 --> 03:41.063
But supportively.

03:42.288 --> 03:42.999
All right.

03:45.938 --> 03:51.148
That was good. Your feet were a little busy.
Maybe quiet your feet down.

03:51.283 --> 03:53.188
- Come on, try it again.
- No more tries.

03:53.880 --> 03:54.701
I hate golf.

03:54.864 --> 03:55.819
I suck at golf.

03:55.960 --> 03:57.511
I no longer want
to play golf.

03:57.751 --> 03:59.225
Honey, you could
only get better.

03:59.468 --> 04:01.046
I'll have to take
your word for it.

04:01.320 --> 04:02.794
Come on. We could
play together.

04:03.163 --> 04:05.066
And you look so
cute in that visor.

04:05.420 --> 04:06.139
I do?

04:08.253 --> 04:12.411
I got to go. We're putting together our
first issue of "Newport Living,"

04:12.501 --> 04:15.423
and we're trying to figure out
what photo of Julie to use on the cover.

04:15.547 --> 04:19.034
Talk about Sophie's Choice.
So who'd you finally get to edit the "Medusa Monthly?"

04:19.202 --> 04:21.303
Carter Buckley. He's really great.

04:21.916 --> 04:26.096
He wants to take it beyond
gossip and dish, focus on culture,

04:26.505 --> 04:29.364
the local art scene. So it's really
more of a pamphlet than a magazine.

04:32.257 --> 04:34.593
Carter Buckley.
Now, what's he done before?

04:34.736 --> 04:38.571
Oh, a bunch of stuff. A magazine,
called The Ugly American,

04:38.986 --> 04:41.052
National Geographic, GQ,

04:41.657 --> 04:44.554
and he self-published
a magazine called Revolution.

04:45.266 --> 04:46.531
You gotta be kidding.

04:46.763 --> 04:49.380
- You know it?
- That was the magazine of Berkeley's left wing.

04:49.540 --> 04:52.684
Portraits of the misunderstood,
the marginalized, the crackpots.

04:52.992 --> 04:55.931
- An entire magazine about losers.
- Oh, but lovable ones.

04:56.057 --> 04:57.253
I read it religiously.

04:57.978 --> 04:59.363
I'm impressed.

05:00.646 --> 05:03.496
- You know, I'd love to meet him.
- Well...

05:03.900 --> 05:05.582
I'll, uh, I'll set something up.

05:08.355 --> 05:11.692
- You found your wedding ring.
- Uh... yeah, behind some cushions.

05:11.785 --> 05:12.583
Thanks for the lesson.

05:41.263 --> 05:42.334
- Hello, Marissa.
- Hey, Cohen.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.325
You seem stressed,
a little distracted.

05:44.740 --> 05:49.250
Yeah, well, it's this bonfire. It'd be
really great if we had, you know, a bonfire.

05:49.380 --> 05:51.723
Well, Coop,
I think I got what ails ya.

05:52.136 --> 05:53.799
First of all,
only Summer calls me Coop.

05:53.882 --> 05:55.815
Yeah, but I figured,
we're back together now,

05:55.891 --> 05:59.506
and you know, if A=C and B=C then A=B,
you know what I'm saying?

05:59.646 --> 06:01.142
No.
I really don't.

06:01.242 --> 06:03.824
So what's your plan?
Who's your social chair savior?

06:05.069 --> 06:05.675
Ryan.

06:06.592 --> 06:08.702
Mr. Water Polo?
I don't think so.

06:08.796 --> 06:11.986
Yeah, but think about this.
That guy worked in... no, no, no...

06:12.137 --> 06:14.854
he toiled in an actual
construction job.

06:14.959 --> 06:17.593
Also, he enjoys architecture
and burning stuff down.

06:18.070 --> 06:19.516
He did torch Caleb's model home.

06:20.335 --> 06:22.041
But I don't know, I mean,
do you think he'd say yes?

06:22.141 --> 06:23.612
To you? How
could he resist?

06:23.742 --> 06:26.653
Especially now that Lindsay's gone,
the kid's kind of blue.

06:27.008 --> 06:30.531
Might be good for him.
Distract him. And it would be fun.

06:30.630 --> 06:33.815
Although I personally
don't see the appeal, yes.

06:34.182 --> 06:35.966
All right, that's
a good idea. Thanks.

06:36.120 --> 06:36.831
Don't mention it.

06:37.657 --> 06:39.565
Seriously, don't,
especially to Summer.

06:46.136 --> 06:50.028
Hello, Mother.
No, I'm not coming home, okay?

06:51.543 --> 06:52.299
Please, do not...

06:54.106 --> 06:55.724
She's such a little me.

07:00.327 --> 07:03.593
Okay, like you're not creepy enough?
You're just appearing in doorways now?

07:03.726 --> 07:05.505
- Trouble at home?
- Like I'd open up to you.

07:05.709 --> 07:08.950
- Well, here if you need me.
- I'll keep that in mind.

07:09.059 --> 07:10.685
- What do you want?
- I want my money.

07:10.910 --> 07:13.763
Again, good to know.
How'd you get past security?

07:13.968 --> 07:17.283
Charm and good looks. Now, I know
you got this magazine ready to launch.

07:17.419 --> 07:19.524
- Get out, Lance.
- This is not the moment when you want

07:19.653 --> 07:25.084
your somehow perfect reputation undone
by one bad decision, and some not so flattering lighting.

07:25.260 --> 07:26.769
You got three days
to get my money,

07:27.091 --> 07:30.589
or everyone in Newport's
gonna see a lot more than your face.

07:42.915 --> 07:44.905
Traffic was terrible.
Is Carter here yet?

07:45.092 --> 07:48.866
Mr. Buckley left a voice mail
at around 3:30 a. m., said don't expect him today.

07:49.032 --> 07:50.972
He say why?

07:51.160 --> 07:53.350
No, but I couldn't understand
everything on the message.

07:53.960 --> 07:56.601
- He was... slurring.
- You're kidding.

07:58.615 --> 08:00.735
Well, I guess Julie and I
will proceed without him.

08:02.713 --> 08:05.372
- Oh, hey, Keeks, can't make the meeting.
- Something up?

08:05.554 --> 08:09.946
Just a critical personal
emergency, but nothing important.

08:13.516 --> 08:14.892
Well, I guess
the meeting's canceled.

08:15.006 --> 08:16.863
I can try Mr. Buckley,
see if he's changed his mind.

08:17.244 --> 08:20.214
Uh, no, I'll-I'll,
I'll take care of it.

08:28.399 --> 08:29.836
So how are you and Alex?

08:30.458 --> 08:32.600
Hmm? You know, really great.

08:32.707 --> 08:34.908
Really great?
Or really great?

08:35.046 --> 08:35.741
Really great.

08:36.147 --> 08:37.573
Thanks for clearing
that up for me, Coop.

08:37.700 --> 08:39.794
Oh, hey, can you tell Seth
never to call me Coop again?

08:39.996 --> 08:41.135
'Cause he kind of
ruined the nickname.

08:41.215 --> 08:41.908
Cohen called you Coop?

08:41.990 --> 08:43.105
- When?
- Earlier.

08:44.216 --> 08:47.929
- Hey, hope I'm not interrupting.
- No, actually, I was hoping I'd run into you.

08:48.140 --> 08:49.970
- Oh, yeah? You were?
- You were?

08:50.047 --> 08:52.855
I was. I need someone
to build the bonfire for us,

08:53.005 --> 08:56.308
and I figured, who else has worked
in construction, likes architecture...

08:56.388 --> 08:58.419
- And has burned down a house?
- Yeah. Exactly.

09:00.944 --> 09:04.017
And I thought it would be fun...
working together.

09:04.472 --> 09:05.549
- Oh, you did.
- You did?

09:06.027 --> 09:09.893
Yeah. Besides, if you don't do it,
then the water polo team's not going to have a pep rally.

09:09.980 --> 09:11.843
Yeah, well, we can't
have that happen. Um...

09:13.226 --> 09:15.934
- Sure, yeah, okay.
- You'll do it? That's great.

09:16.363 --> 09:18.201
- Isn't that great?
- It's great!

09:18.604 --> 09:20.936
- What's great?
- Ryan's going to build the bonfire for us.

09:21.437 --> 09:24.324
Hey, great idea, you two.
I love that,

09:24.693 --> 09:26.853
making it happen
on behalf of the school.

09:27.060 --> 09:31.130
Yeah, you know, the idea
is just inspired.

09:31.334 --> 09:34.757
Well, I've got a big test
to study for,

09:34.868 --> 09:36.923
so it looks like
I'll be eating in the library

09:37.001 --> 09:39.383
So long.
Oh, come on! Do you have to go?

09:39.475 --> 09:40.857
You know, will you two
excuse me?

09:42.771 --> 09:45.872
Um, so, thanks again.
I'll see you after school?

09:46.275 --> 09:49.126
- Yeah, sure. My place?
- Your place with Alex?

09:49.333 --> 09:52.791
- Yeah. Is that a problem?
- No.

09:53.728 --> 09:54.403
Okay.

09:56.137 --> 09:57.168
No problem at all.

09:58.263 --> 10:01.145
I looked in the box.
This computer does not have an access key.

10:01.281 --> 10:04.213
Look, look, look, all I want
to do is check my E-mail.

10:04.461 --> 10:08.903
No!
Do not transfer me.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.719
You must have been
talking to Marissa.

10:11.848 --> 10:14.461
Julie, you scared me...
more than usual.

10:14.735 --> 10:18.571
- Always a pleasure, Sanford.
- Only Caleb gets to call me Sanford because he won't not.

10:19.964 --> 10:22.440
- What are you doing here?
- Official business.

10:24.763 --> 10:26.674
And as a new client,
I'm not impressed.

10:26.953 --> 10:30.395
If this is a marital issue, I'm going
to have to decline. Caleb's got me on retainer.

10:30.514 --> 10:34.417
Caleb and I are just fine,
thanks, and well, I'm trying to keep it that way.

10:51.367 --> 10:56.933
I think this is
the first time in my life I'm actually speechless.

10:57.018 --> 10:57.822
It was the '80s.

10:58.361 --> 11:00.643
I was young,
I had no money and...

11:02.296 --> 11:03.372
it was the '80s.

11:03.596 --> 11:06.663
Well, that explains everything.
I'm not going to give you my whole sob story.

11:06.763 --> 11:09.565
Needless to say,
I never thought that it would resurface.

11:09.793 --> 11:15.112
- So where did this come from?
- The auteur behind this masterpiece, his name is Lance Baldwin.

11:15.859 --> 11:19.724
- He's an ex.
- So you started with a porn producer and you ended up with Caleb.

11:20.437 --> 11:22.230
See, I'd consider
that a lateral move.

11:22.316 --> 11:27.442
He wants half a million or he goes public
on the eve of Newport Living's launch.

11:28.131 --> 11:30.892
- You've got to go to the cops.
- No, Sandy, no cops.

11:30.983 --> 11:33.391
And before you even suggest it,
no Caleb.

11:35.181 --> 11:40.295
- I am so not the guy for this.
- Sandy, please.

11:41.319 --> 11:42.471
I'm begging you.

11:44.002 --> 11:47.698
Forget the company
or my marriage.

11:47.917 --> 11:50.340
If Marissa ever
found out about this...

11:50.463 --> 11:55.256
I mean, she's already moved out on me.
She won't take my calls.

11:58.415 --> 12:01.331
She would never
speak to me again.

12:06.441 --> 12:07.854
Oh, it's all right, Julie.

12:12.137 --> 12:14.666
You deal with Marissa
and I'll...

12:15.170 --> 12:18.860
I'll deal with the Colonel.
It's a Boogie Nights reference.

12:20.409 --> 12:21.487
Expect a lot of them.

12:35.151 --> 12:36.577
Fine, don't worry about
it, I wasn't reading.

12:36.720 --> 12:38.528
What the hell
is your problem, Cohen?!

12:41.134 --> 12:43.257
You're interrupting
very studious people.

12:43.400 --> 12:44.133
Like me.

12:53.361 --> 12:55.984
- Now no one can hear you scream.
- What is your problem, woman?

12:56.167 --> 12:58.938
You are. What did I tell you
about messing with Ryan and Marissa?

12:59.074 --> 13:02.548
I was concerned that the water polo team
was gonna be without a pep rally this year,

13:02.647 --> 13:04.748
so I suggested it for the good of the school.

13:04.855 --> 13:05.478
Cohen.

13:06.777 --> 13:08.002
- They belong together.
- No, they don't.

13:08.117 --> 13:11.011
Yes, they do. It is me and you
and it is Ryan and Marissa.

13:11.110 --> 13:12.545
And that's the way
it's supposed to be.

13:12.631 --> 13:13.659
Listen up, Ass Hat.

13:14.044 --> 13:17.670
Ryan and Marissa separate,
both great people that I love.

13:17.785 --> 13:19.519
Together, disaster.

13:19.796 --> 13:21.331
So stay away from
them, all right?

13:21.414 --> 13:24.108
Or otherwise more than the
bonfire is going up in flames.

13:25.504 --> 13:26.458
I can make no promises.

13:30.697 --> 13:31.474
Hey, what's up?

13:31.998 --> 13:34.245
Nothing. I just wanted to see
what you were up to after school.

13:34.344 --> 13:35.759
I feel like we haven't had
a lot of time to hang.

13:36.137 --> 13:39.476
I know, I just, I have
this project to work on after school with Ryan.

13:39.899 --> 13:40.810
With Ryan?

13:42.669 --> 13:43.385
What thing?

13:44.159 --> 13:47.560
- This bonfire pep rally.
- You never mentioned a pep rally.

13:47.764 --> 13:50.767
Yeah, well, I kind of have a handle
on your sense of school spirit.

13:51.642 --> 13:55.237
Yeah, good point. so I guess
I'll just see you at home?

14:02.983 --> 14:05.635
- Hello?
- Yeah, sorry. I'll see you later.

14:25.258 --> 14:26.312
Hello?!
Anyone here?!

14:29.636 --> 14:32.268
Kirsten. Sorry, private party.

14:33.123 --> 14:35.470
We had a meeting.
You want to explain what happened?

14:36.359 --> 14:38.358
Oh, it was just a little thing
I like to call...

14:39.691 --> 14:42.151
- my wedding anniversary.
- You're divorced.

14:42.406 --> 14:44.134
No wonder this party sucks.

14:45.652 --> 14:48.534
I see you found your ring.
Must mean you're still married.

14:49.672 --> 14:51.083
Thanks for stopping by.

14:57.561 --> 14:59.294
Look, I'm sorry
I just stopped by.

14:59.469 --> 15:01.932
But you could at least apologize
for blowing off the meeting.

15:02.072 --> 15:05.106
Right. Yeah. I'm sorry.

15:05.215 --> 15:08.866
And I'm sorry for all the...
future meetings I'm gonna miss.

15:10.485 --> 15:10.982
You see?

15:11.125 --> 15:13.608
Now you don't have to feel bad
about firing me.

15:13.760 --> 15:16.882
Maybe you're not in the best frame
of mind to be having this discussion.

15:17.019 --> 15:19.346
And I'm going to be
less self-loathing if I'm sober?

15:19.568 --> 15:22.282
Come on, I work for a rag
about Julie Cooper... Nichol.

15:22.362 --> 15:24.709
No, it's about culture,
it's about art.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.107
Oh, come on, Kirsten,

15:26.455 --> 15:31.132
this magazine is just a photo opportunity
for 55-year-old women with 25-year-old breasts.

15:31.276 --> 15:34.865
But this is a chance to turn
this community upside down.

15:34.985 --> 15:36.738
Be subversive,
irreverent.

15:37.725 --> 15:39.908
I'd rather be drunk.

15:59.403 --> 16:01.825
You see, Oats, it was even
the same for The Valley.

16:02.190 --> 16:04.814
Last year was just better.

16:06.359 --> 16:07.751
You and Captain Oats
catching up?

16:08.201 --> 16:11.034
Yeah. Does he seem grumpy
to you these days?

16:11.220 --> 16:15.380
I know how he feels. This bonfire
thing, it's a disaster.

16:16.172 --> 16:20.481
you and Marissa working on the
bonfire together. That's pretty cool, huh?

16:20.634 --> 16:23.722
Not so far.
Did a bunch of designs, but they all suck.

16:23.887 --> 16:26.330
Yeah, well, I'm sure whatever you
come with, Marissa will love you.

16:28.216 --> 16:28.906
It.

16:30.456 --> 16:31.943
Dude, there's nothing going on
with me and Marissa.

16:32.016 --> 16:35.333
- Oh, it's none of my business.
- Hey. You guys cool fending for yourselves for dinner?

16:35.932 --> 16:36.552
Sure.

16:36.677 --> 16:39.882
Your mother's at work and I've got to run.
But I'm leaving you some money for pizza.

16:40.109 --> 16:42.169
Thanks.
You two all right?

16:42.680 --> 16:44.313
Yeah. Just a
school project.

16:44.812 --> 16:49.482
Ryan's working with Marissa.
Oh, you and Marissa. That's nice, just like last year.

16:50.516 --> 16:52.531
You and Mom have been
kind of working a lot lately.

16:52.610 --> 16:55.230
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah, yeah. Everything's fine, just busy.

16:55.357 --> 16:58.882
I feel like there's maybe been
some kind of tension recently.

16:58.990 --> 17:02.584
Well, listen, you're married to someone for 20 years,
you're bound to hit a few speed bumps.

17:02.641 --> 17:04.705
It takes work.
But it doesn't mean we don't love each other.

17:04.907 --> 17:06.224
- Good.
- Okay, I'll see ya.

17:06.398 --> 17:07.356
- All right.
- Bye.

17:09.146 --> 17:10.592
You hear that, Ryan?
Love takes work.

17:11.469 --> 17:13.998
- Are you referring to me and Marissa?
- No. I'm staying out of that.

17:14.055 --> 17:16.112
You go work on
your cool bonfire.

17:16.196 --> 17:22.771
- Me and Oats are gonna order in.
- Hey, can I borrow Captain Oats?

17:22.954 --> 17:26.065
Sure. But he's a poor
substitute for a broken heart.

17:30.112 --> 17:33.183
Oats, if he touches you
anywhere weird,

17:33.725 --> 17:35.004
and by weird I mean...

17:37.732 --> 17:40.465
I want you to neigh
as loud as you can.

17:43.735 --> 17:47.901
See, you're punching people.
That's very last year.

17:49.070 --> 17:50.273
It's cool, though.

17:56.468 --> 17:56.958
What?

17:57.631 --> 17:59.588
It's nice to see you,
too, sweetie.

18:00.036 --> 18:01.917
Whoa, hello?
I haven't been vaccinated.

18:02.048 --> 18:06.184
- What do you want?
- Well, I thought that we could talk face-to-face.

18:07.063 --> 18:08.372
- May I come in?
- No.

18:08.472 --> 18:10.234
Don't you think you're
taking this a little too far?

18:10.466 --> 18:12.782
You enjoy living in squalor?

18:12.937 --> 18:15.711
Well, you and Caleb don't live here,
so it can't be that disgusting.

18:15.858 --> 18:18.288
- I could make you come home.
- What are you gonna do, call the cops?

18:18.433 --> 18:19.713
I'd love to tell them
all about you.

18:19.777 --> 18:21.490
- I could take away your credit cards.
- I'll get a job.

18:21.621 --> 18:25.123
- You? Doing what?
- Or maybe I'll just steal. You know I'm really good at that.

18:25.320 --> 18:29.917
Marissa.
Come home, please.

18:30.346 --> 18:33.361
Don't throw away your future
just because you hate me.

18:34.748 --> 18:39.230
We've all done things in life that we regret,
but it is never too late.

18:40.105 --> 18:42.479
- The door is always open.
- Not this one.

18:57.900 --> 19:01.164
Hey, you're in my room.

19:01.908 --> 19:03.559
Which never happened
when we were dating.

19:03.697 --> 19:05.347
I hope I'm not interrupting.

19:05.391 --> 19:07.062
What, are you trying on
new clothes or something?

19:07.675 --> 19:10.034
No, actually,
I've been trying on clothes from last year.

19:10.608 --> 19:11.530
Come in.

19:13.055 --> 19:14.755
Hi. What's going on?

19:14.978 --> 19:18.813
I know this is weird,
but, I need your advice.

19:19.839 --> 19:20.730
It's about Marissa.

19:21.748 --> 19:25.940
Well, I'm a little fuzzy
on your guys' relationship,

19:26.123 --> 19:29.426
so perhaps you have some photos
or a video or things you...

19:31.209 --> 19:32.539
I was just trying to be
thorough.

19:32.891 --> 19:36.736
It's not about me and Marissa.
This is about Marissa and Ryan.

19:38.334 --> 19:39.978
I just...
I have a sense about them.

19:40.057 --> 19:43.110
- Yeah, I have a lot of...
- Oh, so there is something going on?

19:43.242 --> 19:47.065
Hey, if you were this sensitive and neurotic when
we were dating, things might have really worked out.

19:49.130 --> 19:52.733
I just... I really, really
have fallen hard for this girl.

19:55.237 --> 19:58.032
Please, will you just tell me
if I am fighting for a lost cause here?

19:58.097 --> 20:01.532
Are they just one of those couples
that will always be a couple?

20:01.895 --> 20:03.583
Is this about the other night
at the mall?

20:04.348 --> 20:07.083
What, no.
I know all about the mall, why?

20:07.240 --> 20:08.779
Okay, so then, big deal.

20:08.866 --> 20:11.255
They slept in a tent together.
A lot of friends would do that.

20:11.354 --> 20:13.010
I'm sorry,
did you just say "tent"?

20:14.200 --> 20:16.531
Does that...
did you think I said that?

20:16.876 --> 20:17.774
No, no,
'cause I said...

20:18.026 --> 20:19.827
what did you think?
No, 'cause I was saying

20:19.936 --> 20:22.301
- that they repented for lent.
- Marissa forgot to mention that part.

20:22.402 --> 20:25.193
- Probably because it wasn't a big deal.
- Well, thank you, you've been very helpful.

20:25.294 --> 20:27.715
Wait, I wasn't even trying
to meddle. I was saying...

20:30.185 --> 20:31.477
Summer's gonna kill me.

21:03.029 --> 21:04.742
- Oh, come in.
- Great. Thanks.

21:06.515 --> 21:08.836
Sorry about the mess.
We're between maids.

21:09.174 --> 21:12.561
Ah, how do you survive?
So where's... where's Alex?

21:12.738 --> 21:15.045
- working.
- Got it.

21:15.214 --> 21:16.323
Just us.

21:19.185 --> 21:20.373
- Yeah, go ahead.
- Okay.

21:21.411 --> 21:23.810
Let's see.
Da-da-dum!

21:23.895 --> 21:26.934
- Captain Oats?
- Yeah, Seth let us borrow him for the bonfire.

21:27.528 --> 21:29.475
Oh, we're not gonna burn
him, though, are we?

21:29.583 --> 21:31.243
No, no. He's our inspiration.

21:31.740 --> 21:35.601
I figure we'll build a scale model so we'll
know how much wood to use for the real thing.

21:35.864 --> 21:39.443
- Oh, a Trojan horse.
- Exactly. So, what do you think?

21:42.355 --> 21:43.638
I think it's perfect.

21:49.156 --> 21:51.903
Yeah, it's not bad.
So let's get started.

21:52.292 --> 21:54.660
How are you with
Popsicle sticks?

21:55.908 --> 21:57.083
Really good.

22:14.029 --> 22:16.528
- You got a warrant?
- You're not suspicious, are you.

22:16.793 --> 22:19.167
I'm Sandy Cohen.
I'm Julie Cooper's attorney.

22:19.969 --> 22:22.089
And I'm a huge
fan of your work.

22:22.177 --> 22:24.701
- You got my money?
- I'm here to negotiate.

22:28.005 --> 22:30.900
Is this gonna be a three-way?
'Cause my rate doubles.

22:31.119 --> 22:32.899
Why don't you grab some
more smokes at the store.

22:32.984 --> 22:33.696
We got business.

22:41.082 --> 22:44.086
You know the offer. 500 grand
makes this thing go away.

22:44.159 --> 22:45.632
Oh, well, that's no offer, that's extortion.

22:46.297 --> 22:50.349
She's willing to pay you $50,000, which could
finance a handful of your masterpieces.

22:50.440 --> 22:52.211
You need to add another zero
to that offer.

22:52.393 --> 22:56.132
Otherwise this thing is streaming live
on the Internet in 72 hours.

22:56.224 --> 22:59.139
- Do you really think anyone's gonna care?
- Oh, I think Julie will.

22:59.291 --> 23:02.427
Enough to save her magazine, her marriage.

23:04.438 --> 23:08.152
- Well... you'll be hearing from me.
- It's been a pleasure.

23:11.069 --> 23:12.773
- This is gonna be great.
- Ah, glad you liked it.

23:13.575 --> 23:15.738
Yeah, and I'm glad Seth
suggested you for the job.

23:17.136 --> 23:19.987
- Seth suggested me?
- Yeah. Why?

23:21.147 --> 23:24.090
No, he's, kind of stuck in the past.

23:24.644 --> 23:26.477
He thinks that now that
he's back with Summer, that...

23:28.188 --> 23:28.596
you know.

23:32.104 --> 23:34.829
- Yeah. Crazy.
- Totally.

23:35.416 --> 23:36.026
Yeah.

23:39.951 --> 23:42.184
- Good night.
- Yeah, good night.

23:55.720 --> 23:57.813
You almost hit me.

23:58.199 --> 23:59.098
I'm sorry, I'll try again.

24:00.227 --> 24:02.992
- What do you think you're doing?
- Let me try to put it in a way you'll understand.

24:04.127 --> 24:05.064
Stay away from her.

24:05.381 --> 24:07.067
- Alex, there's nothing going on.
- What're you talking about?

24:07.129 --> 24:09.176
Studying late together?
Sharing a sleeping bag?

24:09.234 --> 24:10.860
Yeah, there's nothing
going on at all, Ryan.

24:11.016 --> 24:13.386
Hey! Hey! Listen to me...
No, no, no. You listen to me.

24:13.585 --> 24:16.917
Don't go near my
girlfriend again.

24:17.971 --> 24:19.331
You understand me now?

24:25.855 --> 24:29.539
- Walk away.
- I'm gone.

24:39.817 --> 24:45.081
- Ah, I'm sorry I missed you last night.
- I'm sorry I missed you, too.

24:47.132 --> 24:49.103
The all-consuming magazine.

24:49.235 --> 24:50.988
- And you were...?
- Also at work.

24:51.275 --> 24:53.352
On a new case.
Another Newport calamity?

24:53.602 --> 24:55.614
No. This is one
I've never seen before.

24:55.812 --> 24:57.750
I hope to never see it again.

24:59.758 --> 25:01.931
Hey, how about you and I log
a little quality time today?

25:02.107 --> 25:06.344
- I'd love to, but I have to work.
- Ah, with Carter Buckley?

25:06.502 --> 25:07.668
Actually, without.

25:07.915 --> 25:10.125
It turns out that Newport Living
wasn't for him after all.

25:10.459 --> 25:13.973
When he didn't show up for work yesterday,
I went by his place, and I found him

25:14.043 --> 25:17.104
drowning in self-pity and tequila.

25:17.209 --> 25:19.777
Only a couple weeks in Newport
and already his spirit is crushed.

25:19.858 --> 25:23.461
I never would've thought that'd be possible.
Here's a guy who built a whole magazine

25:23.570 --> 25:25.885
around people who fought the system, no matter the cost.

25:26.740 --> 25:28.038
The guy was
an inspiration to me.

25:29.445 --> 25:33.145
You know, that magazine of his
that you loved in college?

25:34.095 --> 25:35.629
Do you happen to have a copy?

25:35.767 --> 25:37.687
Revolution?
Yeah, I probably do.

25:38.093 --> 25:40.733
Probably in the office
Or the garage.

25:47.150 --> 25:49.362
Hey, man. How'd it go
last night with Marissa?

25:50.469 --> 25:52.090
Things with Marissa
went great.

25:52.296 --> 25:52.857
Good.

25:55.138 --> 25:57.253
Things with Alex,
not so much.

25:59.459 --> 26:01.286
- Alex was there?
- Yeah.

26:01.803 --> 26:03.265
She threw a beer
can at my head.

26:03.513 --> 26:06.186
- What?!
- And shoved me a couple times, yeah.

26:06.598 --> 26:10.166
- Pretty hard, actually.
- That is one angry lesbian.

26:16.116 --> 26:18.180
Okay,
here's the thing.

26:18.675 --> 26:22.617
I may have accidentally let a
little something slip about, you know...

26:22.714 --> 26:25.750
- A tent?
- No, I didn't. Yeah, okay, maybe. Yes, I did,

26:25.837 --> 26:28.503
- but I don't understand why she's making
- such a big deal out of it.

26:28.549 --> 26:29.822
Like there's something dirty about camping.

26:29.956 --> 26:31.838
And before Alex and I had
our friendly little chat,

26:32.186 --> 26:34.753
Marissa mentioned that it was your idea
that we work on the bonfire together.

26:35.014 --> 26:36.973
I might have been
the one to mention it,

26:37.070 --> 26:40.436
- but I don't think I should hog all the credit.
- Stay out of it!

26:42.278 --> 26:44.013
Just 'cause you're back with Summer
doesn't mean me and Marissa...

26:44.105 --> 26:45.174
I know.

26:47.580 --> 26:50.549
- You were just a lot happier back then, okay, so...
- Well, that was then.

26:51.418 --> 26:52.839
All right.

27:10.845 --> 27:13.225
Hey, I'm not gonna
be able to make it tonight.

27:14.459 --> 27:18.523
But, uh, the wood's ordered, and
you have the plans, so everything should be fine.

27:19.415 --> 27:20.098
Have fun.

27:24.629 --> 27:28.204
- Who was that?
- My mom.

27:29.048 --> 27:30.470
More empty threats.

27:31.590 --> 27:33.750
You were asleep last night when I got home.

27:34.673 --> 27:36.602
Yeah. Yeah,
I was really tired.

27:37.107 --> 27:39.780
You should try sleeping
in a tent with Ryan.

27:41.269 --> 27:43.843
Oh, but you already did that.

27:46.136 --> 27:48.236
Look, I'm sorry.
I was going to tell you that.

27:48.455 --> 27:50.993
It's just, I didn't want
to make it a big deal.

27:51.079 --> 27:53.203
- Well, it wasn't until you lied.
- I didn't lie.

27:54.555 --> 27:55.510
- I just...
- Lied?

27:59.844 --> 28:00.862
No big deal.

28:10.402 --> 28:12.057
Please tell me
you have some good news.

28:12.347 --> 28:14.785
Well, unfortunately, Lance is
as sleazy as he looks...

28:15.526 --> 28:16.487
but not as dumb.

28:17.436 --> 28:19.696
He owns the rights to the movie
in perpetuity,

28:19.944 --> 28:24.704
and you were a consenting adult when it was shot,
so if he wants to make money off it, it's his prerogative.

28:24.797 --> 28:27.342
Sandy, there's got to be
some way to stop him.

28:27.493 --> 28:29.870
Yeah, we could charge him with
extortion and get an injunction,

28:30.135 --> 28:31.483
but that would involve
the authorities.

28:31.528 --> 28:35.822
Even if I paid him off, there's nothing
to stop him from leaking it anyway.

28:37.191 --> 28:38.274
Look, I'll figure
something out.

28:39.040 --> 28:40.914
You worry about Marissa;
I'll handle the rest.

28:41.492 --> 28:43.831
I can worry all I want,
doesn't seem to help anything.

28:44.277 --> 28:49.338
Why is it that the one person who knows what's best
for their childis the last person that child wants to hear from?

28:49.671 --> 28:52.505
Yeah, we had a similar situation
with Seth last summer, and...

28:52.840 --> 28:57.943
all I can say is that sometimes
it's not the message, it's the messenger.

29:21.662 --> 29:23.722
I don't know, Coop, it sounds
like a pretty bad fight.

29:23.782 --> 29:26.393
- I mean, maybe you should just move home.
- I can't

29:26.957 --> 29:29.529
Because you love Alex and
wherever she is, that's your home?

29:30.098 --> 29:31.597
Because it'll make
my mom too happy.

29:34.836 --> 29:36.098
What was I thinking?

29:36.545 --> 29:41.629
Well... you can't go to the
bonfire with Ryan, then go home to Alex.

29:42.169 --> 29:44.299
You can't ride two horses
with one ass.

29:45.661 --> 29:46.542
It's a proverb.

29:47.946 --> 29:50.341
Okay, well, Ryan is not
going to the bonfire.

29:50.583 --> 29:52.627
What? Why? I thought
it was, like, his idea.

29:52.732 --> 29:55.113
He didn't say,
but I know it's because of Alex.

29:55.265 --> 29:57.388
Wait, I'm confused...
I thought Alex wasn't going.

29:57.557 --> 30:02.328
She's not, but Ryan and I were working late
at the apartment the other night,

30:02.396 --> 30:05.597
and, well, somehow she found
out about the mall and the tent, and...

30:05.808 --> 30:07.696
well, I hadn't exactly
told her about it.

30:08.036 --> 30:09.826
Well, if you didn't tell her,
then who did?

30:14.191 --> 30:16.753
Oh, I am going to kick his ass
back to last year!

30:16.832 --> 30:19.287
Whoa. Hello? Summer?
Whose ass?

30:24.145 --> 30:26.285
Not now, Seth. I'm busy.

30:27.127 --> 30:31.846
sorry to interrupt you
doing... whatever it is you were doing.

30:32.256 --> 30:33.209
Brooding, is it?

30:33.288 --> 30:36.436
Yeah, and right now I'm in the middle
of a major session, so if you could just...

30:39.616 --> 30:40.475
What's going on?

30:40.679 --> 30:44.097
Well, actually, I'm very glad that
I caught you before you go to the bonfire.

30:44.237 --> 30:46.407
- I'm not going to the bonfire.
- Oh, but you have to go.

30:46.836 --> 30:48.375
What, are you and Seth
working on the same team now?

30:48.457 --> 30:52.350
No, I'm on my own mission:
I need help... with Marissa.

30:52.677 --> 30:56.954
For whatever reason that I don't
quite understand, she listens to you.

30:58.357 --> 30:59.342
She needs help.

30:59.503 --> 31:00.586
Maybe she's happy
where she is.

31:00.753 --> 31:03.191
Do you honestly think that
Marissa knows what she wants right now?

31:03.887 --> 31:06.797
She is in so far over her head
with this relationship.

31:06.924 --> 31:09.075
She's skipping school,
she's staying out all hours,

31:09.148 --> 31:11.845
risking everything that's
important to her just to prove a point.

31:12.375 --> 31:17.467
- Okay. So what do you want me to do about it?
- Well, I know that she wants to come home,

31:17.599 --> 31:20.688
but if she does it for me, it's like she's letting me win.
But if she does it for you...

31:20.778 --> 31:23.331
No, I'm not getting in the
middle of Marissa's life.

31:23.396 --> 31:25.847
All right? Not again. And especially
her relationship with Alex.

31:26.127 --> 31:32.100
This is not about Alex. It's about Marissa and her
future, which we can both see is slipping away from her.

31:33.083 --> 31:34.985
Ryan, please help me.

31:35.994 --> 31:37.683
Convince her to come home.

31:40.195 --> 31:42.589
You know that's
what's for the best.

32:00.118 --> 32:01.603
What the hell
are you doing here?

32:01.748 --> 32:02.476
Looking for Marissa.

32:03.079 --> 32:06.208
- This is you staying away?
- It's not about me. I'm here 'cause of her mom.

32:06.516 --> 32:08.712
What, are you and Julie Cooper a team now?

32:08.888 --> 32:11.693
- Yeah. Where is she?
- She's at her little bonfire.

32:11.980 --> 32:12.698
All right.

32:12.915 --> 32:14.978
No, no, you remember what I told you last night.

32:15.079 --> 32:17.325
- You stay away from her.
- Or what?

32:17.419 --> 32:18.750
- You want to find out?
- Sure.

32:18.893 --> 32:21.353
You go down there, it's on.

32:21.531 --> 32:22.386
Great.

32:23.694 --> 32:25.801
You know, this sort of thing
used to be my specialty.

32:27.858 --> 32:33.363
Oh. Little word of advice. If you got to try
this hard, it's not working.

32:52.230 --> 32:54.977
Is this part for the hind legs or the front?
It's just labeled "leg. "

32:55.089 --> 32:56.914
Um, front, I think.

32:57.597 --> 33:02.003
- Right or left?
- Guess. The odds are fifty-fifty.

33:02.169 --> 33:07.384
Marissa,the horse's head
seems to only fit the hindquarters.

33:07.653 --> 33:09.279
What do we do?
We're running out of time.

33:09.516 --> 33:12.358
I don't know, okay?
I picked the font for the banner.

33:12.625 --> 33:16.251
I color-coordinated the balloons.
This is not my area of expertise.

33:16.816 --> 33:17.872
Maybe I can help.

33:18.682 --> 33:23.386
- I thought you weren't coming.
- Yeah, well, Captain Oats was concerned that he'd be well-represented.

33:23.462 --> 33:26.231
He's very self-conscious.
He is... Seth's horse.

33:26.376 --> 33:29.317
- So you gonna stick it out?
- Uh, yeah, if I'm needed.

33:29.666 --> 33:32.425
Oh, yeah. Hang on!
Hey, everybody?

33:32.865 --> 33:36.803
This is Ryan.
He's gonna answer any and all of your questions.

33:49.538 --> 33:53.524
All right! Great. That horse is gonna
have its head up its ass if we're not careful.

33:53.642 --> 33:55.643
We need to rotate the neck
over to the other side.

33:55.752 --> 33:57.884
You guys in back. You guys take care of that.

33:58.042 --> 34:00.956
I need you ladies,
right over there, you need to hoe that area.

34:01.100 --> 34:04.703
Hoe that thing down. We need to, uh, we need
to set the tiki torches over here.

34:05.105 --> 34:07.000
Hey! You with the gasoline!

34:07.189 --> 34:09.188
Away from the fire!
What are you doing, man?

34:11.226 --> 34:11.964
All right!

34:12.963 --> 34:16.016
Sun's gonna be down in about an hour.
We can make this happen, okay, people?

34:16.172 --> 34:16.989
Let's go, let's go!

34:23.833 --> 34:25.356
Well, that was a dirty trick.

34:26.449 --> 34:28.152
Haunting me with my past.

34:28.766 --> 34:32.088
I was trying to inspire you.
You know, looking this thing over,

34:32.289 --> 34:34.534
it feels like a lifetime ago.

34:35.730 --> 34:38.379
What was I thinking, making
a magazine all about losers?

34:38.507 --> 34:40.393
Well, at least
they were lovable ones.

34:44.150 --> 34:45.938
Where'd you find this?

34:46.070 --> 34:51.976
Oh, a crusading idealist who remembers every word
of that magazine like it was yesterday...

34:53.190 --> 34:53.980
my husband.

34:56.804 --> 34:58.444
Well, I'll have to meet him.

35:02.892 --> 35:05.769
So, what do you think?
You in?

35:07.116 --> 35:10.612
You say subversive and irreverent,
I say Julie Cooper Nichol.

35:10.685 --> 35:12.456
- Where's that leave us?
- Pretty much lost.

35:13.923 --> 35:16.011
That's pretty much
my favorite place to start.

35:17.260 --> 35:24.428
I've got an idea. Okay, it's not really my idea.
One of the other people from the magazine thought it up, but...

35:30.467 --> 35:32.521
Summer.
Hey, how are you?

35:32.835 --> 35:36.026
I hope you have some Motrin in the house,
'cause you are about to feel some pain!

35:36.379 --> 35:39.967
- I just wanted everyone to be happy!
- Yeah, well, nice going 'cause now everybody is miserable!

35:40.078 --> 35:42.239
You need to start apologizing,
starting with Ryan!

35:42.546 --> 35:43.304
Okay!
Go!

35:46.674 --> 35:49.975
Ryan? You around?
I'm here to apologize.

35:50.063 --> 35:51.976
- He's not here.
- Yeah, I know, I can see that.

35:52.127 --> 35:53.333
Well, where is he?

35:55.213 --> 35:58.945
- You think he went to the bonfire?
- If so, we have a four-alarm emergency on our hands.

35:59.111 --> 36:00.460
Break out your hose, Cohen!

36:03.899 --> 36:05.909
- It's a metaphor.
- I know.

36:11.144 --> 36:12.991
- You got me my money?
- I got this.

36:18.043 --> 36:19.494
You're starting
your own film company.

36:19.547 --> 36:21.995
What better star to hitch
my wagon to than Julie Cooper.

36:22.204 --> 36:25.317
- So you're buying the film from me.
- The master, the film and the negatives.

36:25.746 --> 36:27.165
We're gonna meet
your offer.

36:30.303 --> 36:32.679
- A hundred bucks?
- Consider it a good-faith deposit.

36:32.853 --> 36:34.253
I need two weeks
to raise the rest.

36:34.367 --> 36:37.341
I sign this, I get
half a mil in two weeks?

36:37.406 --> 36:38.146
That's right.

36:47.232 --> 36:48.233
And Lance, just so you know,

36:48.530 --> 36:50.509
if one frame of this
leaks onto the Internet...

36:50.608 --> 36:52.949
I'm not saying that would happen
because you seem like a stand-up guy...

36:53.127 --> 36:55.332
we're coming after you for
ten times the amount, all right?

36:55.663 --> 36:57.338
For copyright infringement and piracy

36:58.224 --> 37:07.056
and... you could go to jail.

37:16.066 --> 37:18.716
I got some good news and some not-so-good news.

37:18.968 --> 37:22.161
- Good news first, always.
- You don't have to worry about the movie surfacing

37:23.100 --> 37:25.067
as long as we pay him,
which is the bad news.

37:25.708 --> 37:27.115
And where am I gonna get
this money?

37:27.222 --> 37:28.622
You're going to have
to talk to Caleb,

37:29.190 --> 37:32.156
- and hopefully he'll understand.
- Oh, yeah, sure he will.

37:32.912 --> 37:36.607
- I am so screwed.
- I know, I saw the footage.

37:49.047 --> 37:50.811
- This is going great.
- Yeah.

37:52.090 --> 37:57.881
- Not for long.
- Hey! What are you doing here?

37:59.265 --> 38:03.128
- Are these your friends?
- Yeah. They're here to see Ryan.

38:03.598 --> 38:04.691
You gotta be kidding me.

38:04.915 --> 38:06.839
Why?
Do you think it's funny?

38:09.452 --> 38:12.218
Hey, guys! Stop it!
Guys, seriously, stop it, okay? Cut it out!

38:18.510 --> 38:19.610
Oh, no, not you guys.

38:19.676 --> 38:21.948
You guys are great!
Go, Harbor!

38:23.613 --> 38:24.907
This is between you and me.

38:25.028 --> 38:26.459
Fine, then let's talk,
you and me.

38:26.755 --> 38:29.409
- Fine.
- You've got wrist cuffs.

38:30.831 --> 38:33.425
- You want to tell me what the hell is going on?
- I just want to talk.

38:33.498 --> 38:38.090
You want to talk? Why don't you tell me why you
brought two skeezy ex-cons to my school bonfire?

38:38.169 --> 38:42.252
I am sorry if I interrupted your bonfire!
It just seems like that's all you ever do lately!

38:42.339 --> 38:44.744
Well, I didn't realize moving in
with you meant giving up my life.

38:44.842 --> 38:48.815
I didn't ask you to give up your life!
All I ever wanted was to be a part of it!

38:48.923 --> 38:51.682
Well, this
is my life, okay?

38:53.884 --> 38:54.743
That's it.

38:55.679 --> 38:56.719
So what do you think?

39:16.133 --> 39:17.110
I think...

39:19.921 --> 39:22.976
this is your life
and I don't fit in.

39:25.486 --> 39:28.925
Pep rallies,
cheerleaders... boys.

39:29.778 --> 39:31.339
Nothing happened with Ryan.

39:31.378 --> 39:34.031
Yeah, not yet, but what do
you give it, a week? A month?

39:41.830 --> 39:44.125
I really wanted this
to work between us.

39:48.524 --> 39:50.717
Look, I'm sorry if I hurt you.

39:56.156 --> 40:00.559
I'm sorry that I brought two
skeezy ex-cons to your bonfire.

40:02.668 --> 40:05.044
Actually, only one of them
ever really served time, but...

40:09.705 --> 40:14.413
- So what happens now?
- Who knows?

40:16.940 --> 40:22.077
I think I might go back home,
save some money, go back to school.

40:24.020 --> 40:30.531
- Actually looks kind of fun.
- Yeah, from really far away.

40:48.262 --> 40:52.457
Come on. We're gonna miss the human pyramid.

41:00.404 --> 41:05.666
Pretty good, huh?
Not a school spirit thing, that's cool.

41:11.677 --> 41:15.250
I'm sorry.
It wasn't about you.

41:16.255 --> 41:17.279
That's okay.

41:33.585 --> 41:36.324
- You okay?
- Yeah.

41:41.959 --> 41:44.061
Now all that's left
is lighting the bonfire.

41:46.190 --> 41:48.579
I don't hear any screaming.
I don't see any ambulances.

41:48.763 --> 41:54.387
Maybe we're here just in time.
Or maybe someone was right all along.

41:59.300 --> 41:59.874
Thanks.

42:01.575 --> 42:03.340
You know what?
This honor's yours.

42:06.147 --> 42:08.870
We built it together,
let's burn it together.

42:25.347 --> 42:27.701
I think Captain Oats
would be very proud...

42:27.884 --> 42:30.559
or deeply disturbed
by this visual.

42:32.729 --> 42:34.483
You guys, it's so good.

42:34.768 --> 42:36.889
Thanks, Seth,
for making it all happen.

42:37.043 --> 42:40.626
Oh, see that? They're
thanking me. That's nice.

42:40.822 --> 42:43.106
So what do you guys
want to do now?

42:45.155 --> 42:46.407
Feel like going home?
