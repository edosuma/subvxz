(John)
'We'll swing back
this way in a month.'

00:18.333 --> 00:20.250
Make sure everything's okay.

00:20.333 --> 00:23.583
Those hijackers so much
as blink in your direction..

00:23.667 --> 00:25.333
...yell. We'll be here.

00:25.417 --> 00:26.792
(male #1)
'Roger. See you then.'

00:26.875 --> 00:28.333
Agamemnon out.

00:30.833 --> 00:32.750
Initiate jump into hyperspace.

00:32.833 --> 00:34.083
Jump point, aye.

00:35.875 --> 00:38.958
[music continues]

00:41.625 --> 00:43.417
Captain, we're getting
a coded signal

00:43.500 --> 00:45.792
from Earth Dome
on Gold Channel one.

00:45.875 --> 00:48.875
It's General Hague,
joint chiefs of staff.

00:51.250 --> 00:52.792
Patch it through to my office.

00:52.875 --> 00:54.042
Yes, sir.

00:56.708 --> 00:57.958
(John)
'Receive.'

00:58.042 --> 01:00.375
General, this is a surprise.

01:00.458 --> 01:01.792
What can I do for you?

01:01.875 --> 01:03.500
In the last few days,
a Minbari warship

01:03.583 --> 01:05.917
has been seen in
Earth-controlled space.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.958
Sector 423 by 2-7.

01:08.042 --> 01:10.917
That would put it about
two jumps from Babylon 5.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.375
Exactly.

01:12.458 --> 01:15.000
We have reason to believe
it may have hostile intent.

01:15.083 --> 01:17.083
I-I don't understand.

01:17.167 --> 01:19.292
The war's been over
for more than 10 years.

01:19.375 --> 01:22.042
Why would the Minbari government
launch an attack?

01:22.125 --> 01:23.333
They wouldn't.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.667
We have a renegade
warship on our hands.

01:25.750 --> 01:26.792
The Trigati.

01:26.875 --> 01:28.125
Looks like it.

01:28.208 --> 01:29.833
We've had three separate
reports of sightings

01:29.917 --> 01:31.167
by ships in that area.

01:31.250 --> 01:32.667
Has it attacked any of them?

01:32.750 --> 01:35.500
Strangely enough,
no, it hasn't. Not yet anyway.

01:35.583 --> 01:37.250
But that may change
at any moment.

01:37.333 --> 01:39.708
The Minbari government
has dispatched a second cruiser

01:39.792 --> 01:42.958
in hopes to find the Trigati
before it does any damage.

01:43.042 --> 01:45.958
But it may be a while
before that cruiser arrives.

01:46.042 --> 01:49.833
When it does, I want you to make
personal contact with it

01:49.917 --> 01:51.292
and coordinate the search.

01:51.375 --> 01:54.208
[clears throat]
General, with all due respect..

01:54.292 --> 01:58.000
...the last time I made personal
contact with a Minbari warship

01:58.083 --> 01:59.708
I sent it straight to hell.

01:59.792 --> 02:02.375
That's why I want you
in that part of space, captain.

02:02.458 --> 02:05.750
You've beaten them once, and, if
necessary, you can do so again.

02:05.833 --> 02:07.875
'Tell no one about this.'

02:07.958 --> 02:09.250
Understood.

02:09.333 --> 02:11.750
So, I'm to take
the Agamemnon to Babylon 5

02:11.833 --> 02:14.792
and coordinate with them,
is that correct?

02:14.875 --> 02:15.917
Not exactly.

02:16.792 --> 02:19.583
I need you to do one other job.

02:19.667 --> 02:21.833
And this comes straight
from the president.

02:24.667 --> 02:26.542
(Susan)
Status report,
Lieutenant Commander

02:26.625 --> 02:28.375
Susan Ivanova recording.

02:28.458 --> 02:30.042
It is now eight days
since the death

02:30.125 --> 02:32.375
of Earth Alliance
President Luis Santiago..

02:32.458 --> 02:34.208
...and five days
since Commander Sinclair

02:34.292 --> 02:36.375
was recalled to Earth
without explanation.

02:38.083 --> 02:41.042
And the whole place
has gone straight to hell.

02:41.125 --> 02:44.083
[indistinct yelling]

02:49.917 --> 02:52.167
And as far as I'm concerned,
the transports can wait

02:52.250 --> 02:53.583
until the sun explodes!

02:53.667 --> 02:55.417
And if you're not happy
with the seating arrangements

02:55.500 --> 02:59.083
I will personally order
your seats to be moved outside

02:59.167 --> 03:01.250
down the hall,
across the station

03:01.333 --> 03:03.625
and into the fusion reactor.

03:03.708 --> 03:06.833
Am I absolutely,
perfectly clear on this?

03:11.250 --> 03:13.375
I can only conclude
that I'm paying off karma

03:13.458 --> 03:15.458
at a vastly accelerated rate.

03:17.333 --> 03:18.917
Security Chief,
Michael Garibaldi

03:19.000 --> 03:21.583
remains in critical
condition in Medlab.

03:21.667 --> 03:23.250
Dr. Franklin's
done all he can..

03:23.333 --> 03:25.417
...but we still don't know
if he'll recover.

03:27.583 --> 03:29.958
As for Ambassador Delenn..

03:30.042 --> 03:33.125
...well...something's going on
in her quarters.

03:33.208 --> 03:34.875
That's for sure.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.833
[beeps]
Ivanova.

03:38.917 --> 03:40.583
(male #2)
'We've got a Gold Channel
message for you.'

03:40.667 --> 03:42.125
'It's General Hague.'

03:42.208 --> 03:44.167
I'll take it
in the briefing room.

03:49.875 --> 03:52.375
Computer, accept and decode
Gold Channel signal.

03:53.583 --> 03:54.625
General.

03:54.708 --> 03:56.833
Lieutenant commander.

03:56.917 --> 03:58.417
This may be breaking
the chain of command

03:58.500 --> 04:00.208
but I have some news
and I felt I should deliver

04:00.292 --> 04:01.625
that news myself.

04:01.708 --> 04:04.500
'Your commanding officer,
Commander Sinclair'

04:04.583 --> 04:07.250
'will not be returning
to Babylon 5.'

04:07.333 --> 04:09.958
He's being reassigned,
permanently.

04:13.625 --> 04:17.833
(male narrator)
The Babylon Project was
our last best hope for peace.

04:19.083 --> 04:22.333
A self-contained world
five miles long.

04:22.417 --> 04:24.417
Located in neutral territory.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.833
A place of commerce
and diplomacy

04:27.917 --> 04:31.000
for a quarter of a million
humans and aliens.

04:33.583 --> 04:35.917
A shining beacon in space

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
all alone in the night.

04:39.083 --> 04:42.500
It was the dawn
of the Third Age of mankind.

04:42.583 --> 04:44.917
The year the Great War
came upon us all.

04:47.250 --> 04:48.542
This is the story

04:48.625 --> 04:51.167
of the last
of the Babylon stations.

04:51.250 --> 04:53.458
The year is 2259.

04:53.542 --> 04:54.583
The name of the place

04:54.667 --> 04:56.792
is Babylon 5.

04:56.875 --> 04:59.917
[theme music]

05:27.000 --> 05:29.833
[music continues]

05:41.667 --> 05:43.875
General, with all due respect

05:43.958 --> 05:46.833
what do you mean you're
reassigning Commander Sinclair?

05:46.917 --> 05:48.083
Reassigning him where?

05:48.167 --> 05:50.083
To the Minbari home world.

05:50.167 --> 05:52.000
He'll be functioning
as the first Earth Ambassador

05:52.083 --> 05:54.250
allowed permanent
residence there.

05:54.333 --> 05:56.708
The president's been trying
to find someone suitable

05:56.792 --> 05:59.625
and the Minbari specifically
requested Sinclair.

05:59.708 --> 06:00.583
But why him?

06:00.667 --> 06:01.750
'That information is strictly'

06:01.833 --> 06:03.167
on a need-to-know basis.

06:03.250 --> 06:04.708
I've already briefed
Captain Sheridan

06:04.792 --> 06:05.750
on the situation.

06:05.833 --> 06:06.917
Captain Sheridan, John Sheridan?

06:07.000 --> 06:08.583
That's right.
I believe you know him.

06:08.667 --> 06:10.792
Yes, sir. I served under him
at the transfer point of Io.

06:10.875 --> 06:13.500
He's a good man
and a fine officer, but

06:13.583 --> 06:15.792
it's bound to be controversial
choice...if I may ask.

06:15.875 --> 06:18.292
You may not, any further
questions, will have to

06:18.375 --> 06:20.125
go through your new CO.

06:20.208 --> 06:22.167
Good day, lieutenant commander.

06:22.250 --> 06:23.458
[device beeps]

06:29.583 --> 06:32.500
[Lennier chanting]

06:37.125 --> 06:38.208
So..

06:39.542 --> 06:41.083
'She's done it, hasn't she?'

06:42.375 --> 06:43.708
She's in there.

06:44.917 --> 06:46.708
We told her to wait.

06:46.792 --> 06:49.417
Prophecy will attend
to itself, we told her.

06:53.750 --> 06:55.958
Now we are committed
to the path.

06:58.250 --> 07:01.000
I've spoken with the other
members of the council.

07:01.083 --> 07:03.792
The Trigati has been
seen in this sector.

07:03.875 --> 07:05.667
If it should appear,
you must go to the humans

07:05.750 --> 07:08.167
and tell them
what we've told you.

07:08.250 --> 07:10.375
'It's time they knew the truth.'

07:12.417 --> 07:14.083
Lieutenant commander,
about the new captain--

07:14.167 --> 07:15.583
Yes, I would like
a full honor guard present

07:15.667 --> 07:17.667
when his ship docks.
We've barely got enough time--

07:17.750 --> 07:19.292
- 'He's here.'
- What?

07:19.375 --> 07:20.958
His Earth force transport
just docked.

07:21.042 --> 07:23.625
Apparently, there was a
miscommunication about the time.

07:29.083 --> 07:30.375
Hello, sir.

07:40.292 --> 07:41.917
Welcome aboard, sir.

07:42.958 --> 07:44.125
I'm authorized
to surrender command of

07:44.208 --> 07:45.750
Babylon 5 to you at this time.

07:45.833 --> 07:48.917
Thank you, lieutenant commander.
I accept command.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.750
Uh, there seems to be
a problem with the unloaders.

07:51.833 --> 07:53.917
Uh, could you have my bags
delivered to my quarters?

07:54.000 --> 07:56.875
- Of course.
- Thank you.

07:56.958 --> 07:58.250
I assume you'd like
to begin with a quick tour

07:58.333 --> 07:59.417
of the facilities?

07:59.500 --> 08:00.417
Yes, absolutely.

08:00.500 --> 08:02.167
Great. Right this way.

08:05.917 --> 08:07.208
(Susan)
'It's good
to see you again, sir.'

08:07.292 --> 08:09.375
- How was your flight?
- Fine.

08:09.458 --> 08:12.542
They actually had
fresh oranges on the transport.

08:12.625 --> 08:16.042
I haven't had an orange
in almost two years.

08:16.125 --> 08:17.750
I used to dream about them.

08:17.833 --> 08:20.042
Grapes, nectarines, plums..

08:20.125 --> 08:22.417
The black ones,
not the red ones.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.333
I mean, it's amazing
what two years on the rim

08:24.417 --> 08:25.958
can do to you.

08:26.042 --> 08:28.833
I have a hunch I'll be spending
a lot of time in hydroponics.

08:28.917 --> 08:30.333
[chuckles]

08:30.417 --> 08:33.000
On the way in, I...read
the station reports

08:33.083 --> 08:35.125
trying to catch up
on everything.

08:35.208 --> 08:36.542
What's our status?

08:36.625 --> 08:39.250
Chief of security's in
critical condition in Medlab.

08:39.333 --> 08:40.875
He thinks there's
a conspiracy concerning

08:40.958 --> 08:42.125
the president's death.

08:42.208 --> 08:45.250
Ambassador G'Kar
has mysteriously vanished.

08:45.333 --> 08:46.708
After two years,
we still don't know what

08:46.792 --> 08:49.583
Ambassador Kosh looks like
inside his encounter suit..

08:49.667 --> 08:53.458
...and Ambassador Delenn
is in a cocoon.

08:53.542 --> 08:54.792
A cocoon?

08:57.042 --> 08:59.417
As in a moth or a butterfly?

08:59.500 --> 09:00.583
Yes, sir.

09:00.667 --> 09:02.083
About yea high.

09:04.417 --> 09:06.417
Interesting place you have here.

09:07.708 --> 09:08.792
Yes, sir.

09:10.375 --> 09:13.458
[indistinct chattering]

09:17.208 --> 09:19.708
Show me this place.

09:19.792 --> 09:23.625
[automated]
'Babylon 5 is divided into
several different sections.'

09:23.708 --> 09:26.458
'Green sector is
for diplomatic personnel.'

09:26.542 --> 09:29.708
'And is closed
to unauthorized personnel.'

09:29.792 --> 09:31.750
'The red sector is for
commerce and..'

09:34.500 --> 09:36.000
And this will be your quarters.

09:36.083 --> 09:37.667
I hope it's satisfactory?

09:37.750 --> 09:40.667
It's fine...fine.

09:40.750 --> 09:42.875
It's certainly a lot bigger
than what I 'm used to.

09:44.917 --> 09:47.042
Does this place
come with a shower?

09:47.125 --> 09:49.208
I mean, a real...live
honest-to-God shower

09:49.292 --> 09:50.667
with running water
and everything?

09:50.750 --> 09:52.125
Executive suites
in command quarters

09:52.208 --> 09:54.833
all have showers with
real live honest-to-God water.

09:54.917 --> 09:56.458
The rest get vibe showers.

09:56.542 --> 09:57.708
Our water reclamation system

09:57.792 --> 09:59.083
can't handle
much more than that.

09:59.167 --> 10:01.458
Mmm, a shower.

10:01.542 --> 10:03.667
I may come to like it here.

10:03.750 --> 10:05.333
Which brings me to something
I've been wanting to ask you.

10:05.417 --> 10:08.708
It's, uh, it's kind of awkward.

10:08.792 --> 10:11.458
You've never worried
about being diplomatic before.

10:11.542 --> 10:13.458
Don't disappoint me
by starting now.

10:14.708 --> 10:15.875
When I heard about
the change in command

10:15.958 --> 10:16.875
I figured we'd get stuck with

10:16.958 --> 10:19.458
some high-level bureaucrat.

10:19.542 --> 10:21.458
Or an admiral or
an ambassador and--

10:21.542 --> 10:22.583
'And why me?'

10:24.042 --> 10:25.833
Yeah, I wondered the same thing.

10:25.917 --> 10:28.208
Apparently, I was the late
president's first choice

10:28.292 --> 10:31.083
to replace Sinclair
in case anything happened.

10:31.167 --> 10:32.542
While commanding the Agamemnon

10:32.625 --> 10:35.500
I worked with many
of the non-aligned worlds..

10:35.583 --> 10:37.708
The Centauri, Narns..

10:38.833 --> 10:40.458
Even a few Minbari.

10:40.542 --> 10:42.625
That's what I
was concerned about.

10:42.708 --> 10:44.625
I mean the Minbari aren't
exactly going to be thrilled

10:44.708 --> 10:47.500
to find out
you're running Babylon 5.

10:47.583 --> 10:49.292
I hear they still call
you "Star Killer."

10:49.375 --> 10:51.667
That was a long time ago,
12 years.

10:53.458 --> 10:55.375
Maybe they've
forgotten about it by now.

10:57.083 --> 10:59.542
Yeah, I know.
I don't believe it either.

11:01.292 --> 11:03.250
Well, one thing for sure..

11:03.333 --> 11:05.375
...I'll be relying
on you pretty heavily

11:05.458 --> 11:08.333
these next few weeks
until I'm up to speed.

11:08.417 --> 11:11.208
That certainly couldn't be
any worse than the last week.

11:11.292 --> 11:13.917
What with President Santiago's
death and everything else.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.583
How's the crew handling it?

11:15.667 --> 11:17.500
They're still pretty shocked.

11:17.583 --> 11:20.042
I don't think the reality
of it has quiet sunken in yet.

11:20.125 --> 11:21.458
And you?

11:23.708 --> 11:26.542
[instrumental music]

11:29.708 --> 11:31.125
I don't know. I just..

11:32.583 --> 11:35.375
I just keep seeing
Earthforce One..

11:35.458 --> 11:37.750
'...blowing up over
and over again in my dreams.'

11:39.625 --> 11:42.542
In all my life, I thought
that I could handle everything.

11:42.625 --> 11:44.083
And fix any problem.

11:45.083 --> 11:46.542
When I saw that, I just..

11:48.292 --> 11:50.458
...realized I couldn't
do anything to stop it.

11:52.667 --> 11:54.583
I don't think I've ever
felt so helpless.

11:54.667 --> 11:57.625
I know. I felt the same way.

11:57.708 --> 11:59.125
'And ever since then,
the crew's needed me'

11:59.208 --> 12:02.333
to be strong for them.
And I've tried.

12:02.417 --> 12:04.000
I don't like to show weakness.

12:05.250 --> 12:06.917
I guess I get it from my father.

12:08.417 --> 12:10.333
But with the added madness
of trying to run this place

12:10.417 --> 12:12.250
and...the commander
being called back to Earth

12:12.333 --> 12:14.458
and the ambassadors
yelling and carrying on..

12:16.958 --> 12:19.292
[sighs]
I don't know, I just..

12:19.375 --> 12:21.583
I just hope
I've done okay by them.

12:23.667 --> 12:26.042
Let's just say
I'm very happy to see you.

12:26.125 --> 12:28.500
I appreciate that.

12:28.583 --> 12:30.917
And coming from you,
it means a lot.

12:32.458 --> 12:33.708
I should also mention
that the crew is really

12:33.792 --> 12:35.292
looking forward to meeting you.

12:35.375 --> 12:37.292
They've heard
all about you and..

12:37.375 --> 12:38.833
...I think right about
now they could really use

12:38.917 --> 12:40.333
something to smile about.

12:40.417 --> 12:42.208
Then we won't keep them waiting.

12:42.292 --> 12:43.500
I'll just grab a fast shower

12:43.583 --> 12:44.833
we'll head up to
command and control

12:44.917 --> 12:46.667
and I'll give them
my good luck speech.

12:46.750 --> 12:48.042
Sir?

12:48.125 --> 12:49.458
'That's the same speech
I gave them I when I took'

12:49.542 --> 12:52.000
command on Io on the Agamemnon.

12:52.083 --> 12:54.042
It's sort of my, uh..

12:54.125 --> 12:55.417
...good luck charm.

12:56.375 --> 12:57.875
I always give it within 24 hours

12:57.958 --> 12:59.458
of taking on a new assignment.

12:59.542 --> 13:00.917
Well then, I look forward
to hearing it.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.333
Would you mind
if I met you in C&amp;C?

13:02.417 --> 13:03.750
I have to take care
of something.

13:03.833 --> 13:05.792
Oh, of course.
See you there in 20 minutes.

13:12.542 --> 13:14.833
In Valen's name. Kalain.

13:14.917 --> 13:16.125
Kalain!

13:16.208 --> 13:17.250
Wait!

13:18.042 --> 13:19.083
Kalain!

13:20.375 --> 13:22.750
We do not harm our own kind,
Kalain. We never have.

13:22.833 --> 13:25.083
Perhaps it is time to start.

13:25.167 --> 13:27.542
The Grey Council
has betrayed us.

13:27.625 --> 13:29.917
What does a little
blood matter now?

13:30.000 --> 13:31.375
No one has been betrayed.

13:31.458 --> 13:34.083
No! No lies.

13:34.167 --> 13:36.875
We have intercepted a message
from the humans to Minbar.

13:36.958 --> 13:39.167
We know they have chosen
Sheridan the Star Killer

13:39.250 --> 13:41.750
to lead this place.
It is an obscenity.

13:41.833 --> 13:43.250
We protested. They ignored us.

13:43.333 --> 13:46.792
Satai Delenn,
did she also ignore you?

13:48.417 --> 13:49.708
How do you know?

13:49.792 --> 13:51.500
We have supporters
even among the council.

13:51.583 --> 13:55.125
They tell us that Sinclair
is now on our world.

13:55.208 --> 13:56.417
He is an ambassador.

13:56.500 --> 13:57.792
So you say.

13:57.875 --> 14:00.417
But the Grey Council
never tells anyone

14:00.500 --> 14:04.125
the whole truth, does it?

14:04.208 --> 14:07.000
If you value your life,
leave now.

14:07.083 --> 14:08.833
While you still can.

14:10.250 --> 14:13.042
[intense music]

14:21.875 --> 14:23.833
[machine beeping]

14:32.833 --> 14:35.375
Good afternoon,
lieutenant commander.

14:35.458 --> 14:37.625
How did you know it was me?

14:37.708 --> 14:39.417
Well, it's 2:45,
you always come by

14:39.500 --> 14:41.042
at 2:45, see how he's doing.

14:42.625 --> 14:43.958
So..

14:44.042 --> 14:45.625
...how's he doing?

14:45.708 --> 14:48.042
Well, still no change.

14:48.125 --> 14:50.167
'We've managed to stabilize
his condition.'

14:50.250 --> 14:51.458
'Dropped in
as many region packs'

14:51.542 --> 14:53.167
'we think his body can handle.'

14:53.250 --> 14:56.458
Now all we can do is wait and
see if he comes out of the coma.

14:56.542 --> 15:00.125
It could be hours, days, weeks..

15:00.208 --> 15:01.625
Years?

15:01.708 --> 15:02.833
Never?

15:04.042 --> 15:05.375
Yeah.

15:05.458 --> 15:07.292
So all we can do is
keep him hooked up like this

15:07.375 --> 15:09.000
what, forever?

15:09.083 --> 15:11.292
Well, the human body
is an amazing thing.

15:12.667 --> 15:16.542
It can cure itself...
or it can simply decide one day

15:16.625 --> 15:18.417
that the world is
too painful to deal with

15:18.500 --> 15:19.750
and won't cooperate
no matter how hard

15:19.833 --> 15:21.333
you try to heal it.

15:22.375 --> 15:23.667
And that debate is going on

15:23.750 --> 15:26.042
'somewhere in Garibaldi's
body right now.'

15:27.542 --> 15:29.542
Just gonna have to wait
and see who wins.

15:29.625 --> 15:32.750
Well, then, I'll say
a prayer for him tonight.

15:32.833 --> 15:34.792
He's agnostic.

15:34.875 --> 15:37.042
Then I'll say half a prayer.

15:44.625 --> 15:46.833
It was an early Earth president

15:46.917 --> 15:50.083
Abraham Lincoln, who...best
described our current--

15:50.167 --> 15:52.042
Captain, they're ready for you.

15:53.375 --> 15:55.375
Ahh! Good. Ahem.

15:58.500 --> 15:59.792
Captain on deck.

16:05.292 --> 16:06.750
As you were.

16:09.792 --> 16:11.542
When I was 21..

16:11.625 --> 16:13.750
...I visited Tibet.

16:13.833 --> 16:16.708
I went to see
the new Dalai Lama.

16:16.792 --> 16:19.500
You do that sort of thing
when you're 21 and

16:19.583 --> 16:21.333
son of a diplomatic envoy.

16:22.833 --> 16:24.792
We had a simple...dinner.

16:25.667 --> 16:27.792
Rice, raisins, carrots..

16:27.875 --> 16:29.917
...steamed, not boiled.

16:30.875 --> 16:32.208
And green tea.

16:33.167 --> 16:34.417
When it was over..

16:35.625 --> 16:37.167
...he looked at me and said..

16:39.125 --> 16:40.833
"Do you understand?"

16:42.875 --> 16:44.750
I said, "No, I didn't."

16:46.958 --> 16:49.917
"A good beginning," he said.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.875
"You'll be even better
when you begin to understand

16:53.958 --> 16:55.708
what you do not understand."

16:57.417 --> 17:01.042
After reading
some of your reports..

17:01.125 --> 17:03.250
...I begin to understand
what I don't understand

17:03.333 --> 17:05.000
about Babylon 5.

17:06.625 --> 17:09.500
But I couldn't wish for a more..

17:09.583 --> 17:10.708
...capable..

17:12.250 --> 17:14.917
...and skilled group of people
to learn from.

17:18.500 --> 17:22.583
It was an early Earth president,
Abraham Lincoln..

17:22.667 --> 17:27.958
...who best described
our current situation. He said..

17:28.042 --> 17:30.708
(male #3)
'C&amp;C, this is security.
We have..'

17:30.792 --> 17:33.333
[clears throat]
Is there a problem?

17:33.417 --> 17:34.875
I'm sorry to bother you, sir

17:34.958 --> 17:36.625
but I 've got security
on the link.

17:36.708 --> 17:39.208
They've got a Minbari
demanding to speak to you.

17:39.292 --> 17:41.208
'He won't say what it's about,
only that it involves'

17:41.292 --> 17:43.167
'the safety of this station.'

17:43.250 --> 17:45.375
'He says it's
absolutely urgent.'

17:46.917 --> 17:49.042
Ah, well, um..

17:49.125 --> 17:50.333
...we'll get back
to this later.

17:50.417 --> 17:53.625
There's...plenty of time
for speeches.

17:53.708 --> 17:54.708
Carry on.

17:55.792 --> 17:57.542
Lieutenant commander.

17:59.750 --> 18:01.167
Hey, hey, hold it right there!

18:01.250 --> 18:03.125
That section's off-limits
to everyone but station

18:03.208 --> 18:05.167
personnel and diplomatic staff.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.500
I'm sorry. I seem to be lost.

18:07.583 --> 18:09.167
I'm looking for Brown two.

18:09.250 --> 18:10.917
Boy, you're way off.
You want the core shuttle.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.167
It's back that way.

18:12.250 --> 18:14.083
I see. Thank you.
I'll be on my way.

18:14.167 --> 18:16.208
After I see your identicard.

18:18.250 --> 18:19.833
[intense music]

18:21.250 --> 18:22.708
Hey, wait a minute. This card..

18:24.583 --> 18:26.500
His name is Kalain.

18:26.583 --> 18:29.042
He was second in command
of one of our flagship cruisers

18:29.125 --> 18:31.417
during the war with your people.

18:31.500 --> 18:35.167
He has not been seen
since the end of the war.

18:35.250 --> 18:37.500
Why do you think he's here
to cause us a problem?

18:37.583 --> 18:39.500
I have my reasons,
I would not be bringing this

18:39.583 --> 18:40.875
'to you otherwise.'

18:40.958 --> 18:42.917
If you will arrange
to have him apprehended

18:43.000 --> 18:46.083
I will have him picked up by
others and conveyed to Minbar.

18:46.167 --> 18:50.292
You said he was second in
command of a Minbari cruiser.

18:50.375 --> 18:51.583
Which one?

18:51.667 --> 18:53.750
I don't see what
that has to do with this.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.375
Was it the Trigati?

18:57.333 --> 18:58.875
What's the Trigati?

18:58.958 --> 19:01.042
It is not something
we like to talk about.

19:06.167 --> 19:08.167
At the end of the war..

19:08.250 --> 19:11.208
...when our ships
were ordered to surrender..

19:11.292 --> 19:12.833
...one of our
war leaders, Cinoval

19:12.917 --> 19:14.708
took his own life
rather than obey

19:14.792 --> 19:19.542
and became...
a martyr to his own crew.

19:19.625 --> 19:21.917
Kalain assumed command

19:22.000 --> 19:23.500
and as a final act of protest

19:23.583 --> 19:26.583
they and the cruiser disappeared
into self-imposed exile.

19:26.667 --> 19:30.083
(John)
Over the years we've heard
rumors of a Minbari cruiser

19:30.167 --> 19:31.750
sighted where
it shouldn't have been.

19:31.833 --> 19:34.583
We always figured
it was the Trigati.

19:34.667 --> 19:36.250
But we've never been
able to prove it.

19:36.333 --> 19:39.458
They believe that they have
been betrayed by their own world

19:39.542 --> 19:41.458
and yours.

19:41.542 --> 19:43.333
Kalain's presence here
could indicate

19:43.417 --> 19:45.792
that they mean to
come out of retirement.

19:49.708 --> 19:51.292
Something I don't understand.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.083
You said you're with
the Minbari government

19:55.167 --> 19:56.458
the ministry of culture.

19:56.542 --> 19:58.042
Yes, that's right.

19:58.125 --> 20:00.167
So, how does someone
in the ministry of culture

20:00.250 --> 20:03.750
know a high-ranking member
of the warrior caste

20:03.833 --> 20:07.250
well enough to recognize him
12 years later?

20:07.333 --> 20:09.708
I would answer your question..

20:09.792 --> 20:12.792
...if I recognized
your authority.

20:12.875 --> 20:15.125
Unlike your predecessor,
my government was not

20:15.208 --> 20:16.792
consulted on your appointment.

20:16.875 --> 20:18.250
The president feels the Minbari

20:18.333 --> 20:20.833
had too much influence
over an Earth outpost.

20:20.917 --> 20:22.083
Times change.

20:22.167 --> 20:23.792
And the day that a man
such as yourself

20:23.875 --> 20:27.792
is given a position of this
importance is a dark day indeed.

20:27.875 --> 20:31.083
We lost many of our best
warriors because of you.

20:32.875 --> 20:35.042
And we do not
soon forget such things.

20:36.417 --> 20:38.417
If there is a doom
on this station

20:38.500 --> 20:40.833
it is because
you brought it here!

20:45.125 --> 20:48.667
Well, he's Grey Council.
He's got to be.

20:48.750 --> 20:50.083
Only someone in the Grey Council

20:50.167 --> 20:51.917
would have had contact
with someone that high

20:52.042 --> 20:53.500
in the Minbari warrior caste.

20:53.583 --> 20:55.458
I mean,
they do not normally mix.

20:57.833 --> 20:59.167
And you were right.

21:00.583 --> 21:02.417
They're not happy
to see me here.

21:03.375 --> 21:05.000
They're a prideful people

21:05.083 --> 21:06.792
and the Black Star
was their flagship.

21:06.875 --> 21:10.333
Hmm...that's why
it made a good target.

21:10.417 --> 21:11.958
How did you take her out?

21:12.042 --> 21:13.833
I've always heard it was
some sort of new maneuver

21:13.917 --> 21:15.625
but I've never
heard the specifics.

21:15.708 --> 21:18.875
There wasn't much style
or finesse involved.

21:20.333 --> 21:22.708
She was huge.
Monstrous.

21:22.792 --> 21:24.833
We tried everything,
none of our weapons

21:24.917 --> 21:27.000
'would lock on to their ships.'

21:27.083 --> 21:30.292
Some kind of stealth technology.

21:30.375 --> 21:34.375
So...I hit on the idea
of mining the asteroid field

21:34.458 --> 21:36.750
between Jupiter and Mars.

21:36.833 --> 21:39.083
'A fusion bomb doesn't have
to lock on to anything'

21:39.167 --> 21:41.917
if it's close enough.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.750
We took out the Black Star
and three of their

21:43.833 --> 21:46.167
heavy cruisers
before they could escape.

21:50.083 --> 21:52.042
It was the only real victory
we had in the whole damn war

21:52.125 --> 21:54.542
and I am not about
to apologize for it.

21:56.875 --> 21:58.625
He said..

21:58.708 --> 22:02.250
...Kalain feels his world
has betrayed him.

22:02.333 --> 22:03.625
If that's true..

22:05.292 --> 22:07.125
...wouldn't your first target
be the representative

22:07.208 --> 22:09.583
of that world?

22:09.667 --> 22:12.125
Delenn.

22:12.208 --> 22:13.208
Get up.

22:13.292 --> 22:16.042
[intense music]

22:18.833 --> 22:21.375
She's in there, isn't she?

22:21.458 --> 22:22.667
Move aside.

22:22.750 --> 22:24.583
Move aside!

22:25.500 --> 22:26.708
Freeze!

22:28.125 --> 22:29.750
Alright, put the gun down.

22:31.792 --> 22:34.625
Put the gun down.
We won't hurt you.

22:34.708 --> 22:38.708
If you are going
to kill me, then do so.

22:38.792 --> 22:41.292
Otherwise, I have
considerable work to do.

22:56.083 --> 22:57.833
You are the new
commanding officer?

22:57.917 --> 23:00.042
Captain John Sheridan,
Earthforce.

23:00.125 --> 23:02.917
Lennier.
Of the Third Fane of Chudomo.

23:06.208 --> 23:09.583
Ambassador Delenn is
indisposed at the moment.

23:09.667 --> 23:12.042
Perhaps you would
come back later.

23:12.125 --> 23:14.042
Much...later.

23:18.375 --> 23:19.583
Of course.

23:22.625 --> 23:24.250
(John)
'Let me get this straight.'

23:24.333 --> 23:27.125
A high-ranking member
of the Minbari warrior caste

23:27.208 --> 23:30.500
who no one has seen
in nearly 12 years

23:30.583 --> 23:33.333
suddenly appears
and for no apparent reason

23:33.417 --> 23:36.958
breaks into Ambassador Delenn's
quarters, gun in hand.

23:38.792 --> 23:41.833
Now, if you were looking
for the Minbari tourist bureau

23:41.917 --> 23:44.375
you were just a little off
course, wouldn't you say?

23:46.333 --> 23:47.792
But the curious thing is..

23:49.542 --> 23:52.333
...you don't finish the job.

23:52.417 --> 23:53.667
You could've killed both of them

23:53.750 --> 23:55.125
and been out of there
in two minutes.

23:55.208 --> 23:57.333
But instead,
we find you standing there

23:57.417 --> 23:58.917
practically waiting for us.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.917
Everyone knows Minbari
do not kill Minbari.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.250
Then why are you here?

24:05.333 --> 24:08.125
Perhaps everyone is wrong.

24:08.208 --> 24:11.000
Maybe you never
intended to kill them at all.

24:11.083 --> 24:13.625
Perhaps something else
is going on.

24:13.708 --> 24:15.375
are the problem.

24:15.458 --> 24:17.375
What's that supposed to mean?

24:19.500 --> 24:21.167
Captain,
we're not getting anywhere.

24:21.250 --> 24:23.083
I suggest we wrap it up
for now and try again tomorrow.

24:23.167 --> 24:24.583
One last thing.

24:26.458 --> 24:29.250
I'm told that after the death
of your commanding officer

24:29.333 --> 24:33.125
you took command
of a Minbari war cruiser.

24:33.208 --> 24:36.958
But if you're here...
where's your ship?

24:39.333 --> 24:42.375
[intense music]

24:47.792 --> 24:49.792
Captain.

24:49.875 --> 24:53.667
I apologize
if I was rude earlier.

24:53.750 --> 24:56.208
There is something
we need to discuss

24:56.292 --> 24:59.000
especially in light
of Kalain's presence.

24:59.083 --> 25:02.542
It concerns the reason
you were sent here

25:02.625 --> 25:05.375
the relocation
of Commander Sinclair

25:05.458 --> 25:08.375
and the reason we surrendered
at the Battle of the Line.

25:15.208 --> 25:18.500
After three years,
the holy war that began

25:18.583 --> 25:21.708
when our leader was killed
by an Earth Explorer Division

25:21.792 --> 25:24.000
was almost over.

25:24.083 --> 25:27.167
(Lennier)
To avenge Dukat's death,
we had pursued your forces

25:27.250 --> 25:29.833
all the way back
to your home world.

25:29.917 --> 25:31.667
The few surviving Earth ships

25:31.750 --> 25:35.250
that were ordered to defend
your world at any cost

25:35.333 --> 25:37.083
were not an obstacle.

25:37.167 --> 25:40.500
The Grey Council had come
to oversee the final victory

25:40.583 --> 25:42.500
of our forces.

25:42.583 --> 25:45.542
They fight bravely.

25:45.625 --> 25:47.583
They cannot harm our ships

25:47.667 --> 25:49.792
but they continue to try.

25:49.875 --> 25:52.667
Whether they fight or not,
they know they will die anyway

25:52.750 --> 25:55.792
so, really, is this bravery?

25:55.875 --> 25:57.583
Or simple desperation?

25:58.875 --> 26:01.000
Perhaps they are the same thing.

26:04.375 --> 26:07.708
We should bring one of them
aboard for questioning.

26:07.792 --> 26:11.375
If our next step is the final
assault on their world..

26:11.458 --> 26:13.458
...we must know their defenses.

26:13.542 --> 26:15.000
Very well, Delenn.

26:15.083 --> 26:16.208
Choose.

26:16.292 --> 26:17.833
But quickly.

26:17.917 --> 26:19.917
We're fast running
out of candidates.

26:22.125 --> 26:23.542
(Delenn)
'That one.'

26:23.625 --> 26:26.708
[dramatic music]

26:32.083 --> 26:34.333
(Lennier)
This was the first time
the Grey Council

26:34.417 --> 26:36.667
would have direct contact
with a human.

26:36.750 --> 26:39.000
In this case, Sinclair.

26:40.375 --> 26:44.000
He was tortured,
interrogated, scanned.

26:44.083 --> 26:45.667
During the course of the scan

26:45.750 --> 26:48.167
the council discovered
something terrible.

26:48.250 --> 26:49.917
At first they refused
to believe it.

26:50.000 --> 26:54.042
So they took in other humans
and had them scanned as well.

26:54.125 --> 26:55.292
But it was true.

26:56.250 --> 26:57.542
What was true?

27:00.208 --> 27:03.083
It is our belief that
every generation of Minbari

27:03.167 --> 27:06.208
is reborn
in each following generation.

27:06.292 --> 27:09.708
'Remove those souls,
and the whole suffers.'

27:09.792 --> 27:11.833
'We are diminished.'

27:11.917 --> 27:16.208
Over the last 2000 years,
there have been fewer Minbari

27:16.292 --> 27:18.625
born into each generation.

27:18.708 --> 27:20.917
And those who are born..

27:21.000 --> 27:24.417
...do not seem equal
to those who came before.

27:24.500 --> 27:29.542
It is almost as if our greater
souls have been disappearing.

27:29.625 --> 27:31.042
At the Battle of the Line

27:31.125 --> 27:33.875
we discovered where
our souls were going.

27:35.500 --> 27:37.375
They were going to you.

27:37.458 --> 27:39.958
'Minbari souls are being reborn'

27:40.042 --> 27:44.042
in part or in full,
in human bodies.

27:44.125 --> 27:47.583
So you stopped the war in order
to avoid harming your own souls?

27:47.667 --> 27:49.292
Yes.

27:49.375 --> 27:52.208
But the council
knew that our people and yours

27:52.292 --> 27:53.875
were not ready
for this information.

27:53.958 --> 27:56.708
It could unravel
our entire society.

27:56.792 --> 27:58.750
So we could not tell
our generals

27:58.833 --> 28:01.792
the reason for the surrender.

28:01.875 --> 28:03.583
We had all memory
of the examination

28:03.667 --> 28:06.875
erased from Sinclair's mind,
and we let him go.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.542
It has been our secret.
Now it is yours.

28:11.625 --> 28:13.333
It must be kept.

28:13.417 --> 28:16.583
Then why break the silence now?
I mean, why tell us?

28:16.667 --> 28:19.083
Because changes are coming.

28:19.167 --> 28:21.333
Commander Sinclair
was the first.

28:21.417 --> 28:22.958
There will be more.

28:23.875 --> 28:25.833
[beeping]

28:25.917 --> 28:27.208
- Yes?
- 'Captain.'

28:27.292 --> 28:28.417
'We've got
something major coming'

28:28.500 --> 28:29.417
'through the jumpgate.'

28:29.500 --> 28:32.583
[dramatic music]

28:33.875 --> 28:35.625
'It's a Minbari cruiser.'

28:35.708 --> 28:37.333
Her gun ports are open,
and targeting systems

28:37.417 --> 28:38.625
are operational.

28:38.708 --> 28:40.125
She's on an attack vector.

28:40.208 --> 28:42.208
Repeat, she's on attack vector.

28:48.583 --> 28:50.125
I had this wonderful dream
the other night.

28:50.208 --> 28:52.792
We were in bed
in this beautiful hotel.

28:52.875 --> 28:54.417
Rose and mint wallpaper.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.458
- 'Hey, Warren.'
- It was sunny and..

28:56.542 --> 28:57.958
Check this out.

28:58.042 --> 28:59.667
(Warren)
Hold on just a sec.

29:04.500 --> 29:08.083
[sighs]
Can-so a man can't even enjoy
a letter from home anymore.

29:09.833 --> 29:11.125
What?

29:12.625 --> 29:13.875
What the hell?

29:15.250 --> 29:17.958
Red alert all quarters.
Have they hailed us yet?

29:18.042 --> 29:20.583
Yes, sir.
Awaiting your arrival.

29:20.667 --> 29:23.667
Activate defense grid,
all squadrons on standby

29:23.750 --> 29:25.375
but I don't want
any actions that might be

29:25.458 --> 29:26.458
considered provocative.

29:26.542 --> 29:27.542
Scrambling fighters.

29:27.625 --> 29:29.708
[indistinct shouting]

29:31.292 --> 29:33.417
(male #4)
'This is red alert.
All stations.'

29:33.500 --> 29:34.875
'This is red alert.'

29:36.958 --> 29:39.333
'This is red alert.
All stations.'

29:39.417 --> 29:41.000
'This is red alert.'

29:44.500 --> 29:45.708
This is Captain John Sheridan

29:45.792 --> 29:47.917
Earth Alliance,
station Babylon 5.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.375
What can I do for you?

29:49.458 --> 29:51.500
This is Aliit Deeron
of the Minbari

29:51.583 --> 29:53.250
war cruiser, Trigati.

29:53.333 --> 29:56.500
You have illegally arrested
and detained the captain

29:56.583 --> 29:57.708
of this vessel.

29:57.792 --> 30:00.208
Your captain assaulted
one of my crew

30:00.292 --> 30:01.917
and was caught
in an attempted murder.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.958
None of your people were killed.

30:04.042 --> 30:06.375
No Minbari was killed.

30:06.458 --> 30:08.708
You have not been harmed.

30:08.792 --> 30:11.042
You will release our captain.

30:11.125 --> 30:13.375
And if we refuse?

30:13.458 --> 30:14.792
Captain,
she's launching fighters.

30:14.875 --> 30:16.917
[intense music]

30:19.042 --> 30:20.667
(male #5)
'Zeta wing, prepare to launch.'

30:22.000 --> 30:23.292
We're cleared.

30:24.375 --> 30:25.875
(male #5)
'God speed, Zeta wing.'

30:31.625 --> 30:33.583
Deeron, recall your fighters.

30:33.667 --> 30:36.917
Any attack on this station will
be considered an act of war.

30:37.000 --> 30:40.417
The war has already
begun, captain.

30:40.500 --> 30:44.167
All that remains now
is honor and death.

30:45.333 --> 30:46.917
And I thought
I was a pessimist.

30:48.833 --> 30:50.333
It's odd she would say that.

30:50.417 --> 30:52.667
So far no one's been killed,
so there's no reason for

30:52.750 --> 30:54.542
this to escalate, unless..

30:57.333 --> 30:58.500
Oh, hell!

30:58.583 --> 31:00.583
- Get me security, fast!
- On it.

31:00.667 --> 31:02.167
They're trying to do
anything they can

31:02.250 --> 31:03.625
to start a shooting war.

31:04.875 --> 31:07.958
But Kalain didn't kill
the security guard.

31:08.042 --> 31:10.292
Or any of us.

31:10.375 --> 31:12.625
And the Trigati didn't
attack any of the ships

31:12.708 --> 31:14.917
that have seen it
the last few days.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.083
What ships?

31:17.167 --> 31:18.792
Sorry. I was under orders
not to tell anyone.

31:18.875 --> 31:20.833
I will explain everything later.

31:20.917 --> 31:23.458
Captain,
security just linked in.

31:23.542 --> 31:25.375
Kalain is dead.

31:25.458 --> 31:26.667
They say it looks like suicide.

31:26.750 --> 31:28.417
That's what I was afraid of.

31:28.500 --> 31:31.125
They want it to look like
are provoking them into war.

31:31.208 --> 31:33.917
But why? I mean this whole bit
about us sharing Minbari souls?

31:34.000 --> 31:35.250
They weren't told, remember?

31:35.333 --> 31:37.500
They don't know
they're not supposed to attack.

31:37.583 --> 31:38.917
You think they'd
believe us if we told them?

31:39.000 --> 31:41.708
(male #5)
'Minbari fighters coming at us.'

31:41.792 --> 31:43.792
That answer your question?

31:43.875 --> 31:46.958
(male #5)
'They're on attack vector,
closing fast.'

31:47.042 --> 31:48.583
We don't have any choice.

31:49.875 --> 31:53.292
All fighters, intercept
enemy craft and engage.

31:53.375 --> 31:55.042
Confirmed, Babylon control.

31:56.042 --> 31:59.125
[dramatic music]

32:02.375 --> 32:04.083
- Those are our fighters?
- 'Yes, sir.'

32:04.167 --> 32:06.042
And those are
the Minbari fighters.

32:06.750 --> 32:08.083
The Minbari.

32:12.042 --> 32:14.000
'What kind of tracking
systems are we using?'

32:14.083 --> 32:15.958
Standard XB7 units. Why?

32:17.042 --> 32:18.500
The same kind we used
during the war

32:18.583 --> 32:20.417
but that doesn't make sense.

32:20.500 --> 32:22.750
We shouldn't be able
to track them at all.

32:24.125 --> 32:25.833
What was that she said?

32:25.917 --> 32:29.333
"All that remains now
is honor and death."

32:33.250 --> 32:34.833
All fighters, hold position.

32:34.917 --> 32:35.875
Sir, what are you doing?

32:35.958 --> 32:36.958
If they hold positions they're

32:37.042 --> 32:38.083
perfect targets.

32:38.167 --> 32:40.167
Zeta squadron
requesting confirmation

32:40.250 --> 32:41.542
of standby order.

32:41.625 --> 32:44.500
(John)
Confirm the order.

32:44.583 --> 32:46.625
Confirm it, damn it!

32:46.708 --> 32:48.292
I know what I'm doing.

32:49.667 --> 32:50.792
All fighters, confirmed.

32:50.875 --> 32:52.708
Maintain position.
Do not advance.

32:52.792 --> 32:54.708
Repeat, do not advance.

32:59.292 --> 33:01.958
Can you deliver a narrow band
transmission point to point

33:02.042 --> 33:03.708
without the Trigati
intercepting it?

33:03.792 --> 33:05.708
We can adjust the laser
delivery system, but--

33:05.792 --> 33:06.917
Do it.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.917
Then open the jumpgate,
send this message

33:09.000 --> 33:10.625
in a tight beam
transmission through the

33:10.708 --> 33:12.708
opening into hyperspace.

33:12.792 --> 33:14.417
Frequency and address,
it's all there.

33:14.500 --> 33:17.333
Enemy fighters
at 30 kilometers and closing.

33:17.417 --> 33:18.917
Activate jumpgate sequence.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.500
(male #5)
'Jumpgate sequence, aye.'

33:24.417 --> 33:27.208
[intense music]

33:30.208 --> 33:31.833
If it's a distress signal,
it won't do any good.

33:31.917 --> 33:34.250
No one can get to us in time.

33:34.333 --> 33:36.750
(male #6)
'Come on, Babylon control,
give us a break here.'

33:36.833 --> 33:40.042
If we're not allowed
to fire, we're dead.

33:41.833 --> 33:43.208
(male #5)
'Enemy at 10 kilometers.'

33:44.167 --> 33:46.625
- 'Eight..'
- Captain..

33:46.708 --> 33:48.500
Hold your fire.

33:48.583 --> 33:50.167
Continue to hold.

33:51.542 --> 33:53.208
What the hell..

33:59.750 --> 34:01.833
I don't understand.
They didn't fire.

34:01.917 --> 34:04.583
They're looping back,
heading for the Trigati.

34:04.667 --> 34:06.750
- Exactly.
- B-but how did you know--

34:06.833 --> 34:08.667
(male #5)
'We've something's
coming through the jumpgate.'

34:12.167 --> 34:14.958
[music continues]

34:19.542 --> 34:20.792
That's why they didn't fire.

34:20.875 --> 34:22.333
They were waiting
for reinforcements.

34:22.417 --> 34:24.875
Negative.

34:24.958 --> 34:27.542
They're here
because I called them.

34:27.625 --> 34:29.125
I knew the Minbari government

34:29.208 --> 34:32.583
had sent another cruiser
to look for the Trigati.

34:32.667 --> 34:34.833
But...since no one's seen it

34:34.917 --> 34:36.875
I figured they were
waiting in hyperspace

34:36.958 --> 34:39.458
until they heard
about another sighting.

34:39.542 --> 34:41.333
Looks like I was right.

34:41.417 --> 34:43.208
But still doesn't explain
how you know the Trigati

34:43.292 --> 34:44.833
wouldn't attack.

34:44.917 --> 34:46.917
(male #5)
'We're monitoring a signal
from the cruiser.'

34:47.000 --> 34:49.708
'They're ordering
the Trigati to surrender.'

34:49.792 --> 34:53.083
It's like I said, one of
the problems during the war

34:53.167 --> 34:55.500
was that, none of our weapons
systems couldn't lock on

34:55.583 --> 34:57.542
to the Minbari vessels.

34:57.625 --> 35:00.333
They used some kind
of stealth technology

35:00.417 --> 35:02.333
we were never able to break.

35:03.667 --> 35:06.583
So how come all of a sudden
we can track them?

35:06.667 --> 35:08.542
They want to be destroyed?

35:08.625 --> 35:12.333
"All that remains...
is honor and death."

35:14.917 --> 35:16.875
They have been in exile
for 12 years.

35:16.958 --> 35:18.875
They can't go home.

35:18.958 --> 35:20.917
They can't surrender
without being dishonored

35:21.000 --> 35:23.542
and they can't fight
without a war.

35:23.625 --> 35:26.208
So by forcing us to attack..

35:26.292 --> 35:28.333
...by dying by human hands..

35:29.583 --> 35:30.792
...they become martyrs.

35:30.875 --> 35:32.833
And because you're known
for having fought them

35:32.917 --> 35:34.542
you're the perfect target.

35:34.625 --> 35:36.875
The Trigati's breaking away.

35:36.958 --> 35:39.458
Starting to open a jump point.

35:39.542 --> 35:40.833
Shall we open fire?

35:40.917 --> 35:43.208
No. The Minbari
will have to do this.

35:43.292 --> 35:45.292
(male #5)
'They're targeting
the Trigati's aft engines.'

35:51.125 --> 35:52.458
(Susan)
'The Trigati's engines
have been hit.'

35:52.542 --> 35:53.958
Unable to make jump.

35:54.042 --> 35:55.792
No change in life signs.
it's a clean hit.

35:55.875 --> 35:58.042
The war cruiser is ordering
the Trigati to stand down

35:58.125 --> 35:59.375
and prepare to be boarded.

35:59.458 --> 36:03.542
- Their response?
- Just one word...honor.

36:03.625 --> 36:04.917
We're picking up
a change in the Trigati's

36:05.000 --> 36:07.708
fusion reactors.
They're moving towards critical.

36:07.792 --> 36:09.750
They're..

36:09.833 --> 36:10.875
Oh, my God.

36:12.583 --> 36:15.625
[dramatic music]

36:24.917 --> 36:27.375
(male #5)
'Signal coming in
from the war cruiser.'

36:30.708 --> 36:32.500
Put it through.

36:34.292 --> 36:35.750
'This is Captain John Sheridan.'

36:35.833 --> 36:37.500
Babylon 5.

36:37.583 --> 36:39.083
Appreciate the help.

36:39.167 --> 36:43.083
Perhaps to you, this was a
tactical problem to be solved.

36:43.167 --> 36:45.958
For us, this has
been a great sorrow.

36:46.042 --> 36:47.917
The crew of the Trigati
were heroes to many

36:48.000 --> 36:49.417
of our people.

36:49.500 --> 36:52.583
Their death will be mourned.

36:52.667 --> 36:55.000
And your name
will be remembered.

37:14.708 --> 37:15.958
[doorbell chimes]

37:18.292 --> 37:19.208
Yes?

37:19.292 --> 37:20.500
[door opens]

37:22.208 --> 37:24.417
Thought I'd stop by,
see if all your things arrived.

37:26.500 --> 37:29.917
Yes, yes. Everything's
present and accounted for.

37:33.917 --> 37:35.167
Something wrong?

37:39.625 --> 37:40.875
When I got my orders..

37:42.667 --> 37:45.083
I figured this place
was a great opportunity.

37:48.583 --> 37:50.667
And now I wonder if

37:50.750 --> 37:52.417
coming here was irresponsible.

37:54.083 --> 37:56.250
'This whole mess
with the Trigati might not'

37:56.333 --> 37:58.917
have happened
if I hadn't been here.

37:59.000 --> 38:03.333
I mean, my presence,
my...actions in the war..

38:08.792 --> 38:11.417
I'm to blame for bringing
all this trouble to Babylon 5.

38:11.500 --> 38:14.333
What was it our friend
in the Grey Council said?

38:14.417 --> 38:16.375
"If there's a doom on this
station, it was you

38:16.458 --> 38:18.542
who brought it here."

38:18.625 --> 38:20.458
'Well, maybe he was right.'

38:23.792 --> 38:25.417
I spoke with the president.

38:27.125 --> 38:29.083
He is the only other
human who knows why

38:29.167 --> 38:31.375
the Minbari surrendered.

38:31.458 --> 38:33.083
And he doesn't believe
this stuff about us

38:33.167 --> 38:35.292
sharing Minbari souls,
and I can't say that

38:35.375 --> 38:36.792
I do either.

38:37.792 --> 38:39.625
But they believe it.

38:39.708 --> 38:41.708
That's why they chose Sinclair
to run this place.

38:41.792 --> 38:44.875
That's why they picked him
to live on their world.

38:44.958 --> 38:47.583
He was their first
human contact.

38:47.667 --> 38:50.042
Him they trust.

38:50.125 --> 38:51.375
But me?

38:55.042 --> 38:56.917
I don't know.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.708
'If Sinclair
had been here instead'

38:58.792 --> 39:01.917
maybe they might
not have attacked.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.583
Maybe they would have.

39:04.667 --> 39:06.583
I've learned a while ago that
there's enough guilt in the

39:06.667 --> 39:09.167
world to go around
without grabbing for more.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.333
'Give yourself the benefit
of the doubt.'

39:15.375 --> 39:18.458
Anyway, if you ever want
to talk about this some more..

39:18.542 --> 39:20.375
...you know where to find me.

39:20.458 --> 39:21.500
Anytime.

39:26.667 --> 39:30.625
I told them, Delenn,
as I was ordered.

39:30.708 --> 39:33.958
I only wish I could have
told them the rest.

39:34.042 --> 39:37.000
About the great enemy
that is returning..

39:37.083 --> 39:39.875
...and the prophecy that
the two sides of our spirit

39:39.958 --> 39:43.792
must unite against
the darkness or be destroyed.

39:43.875 --> 39:47.333
They say...it will take
both of our races

39:47.417 --> 39:50.042
to stop the darkness.

39:50.125 --> 39:53.292
I'm told that the Earthers
will discover all this

39:53.375 --> 39:55.917
soon enough on their own.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.750
I hope they are right.

39:57.833 --> 39:59.333
Because if we are wrong..

40:00.750 --> 40:03.125
...no one
will survive our mistake.

40:05.833 --> 40:07.250
'Good night, Delenn.'

40:25.792 --> 40:27.792
[jazz music]

40:33.917 --> 40:36.292
[indistinct chattering]

40:36.375 --> 40:39.500
(male #6)
'Well, I'm not saying I mind
looking an entire squadron'

40:39.583 --> 40:42.167
'of Minbari fighters
right in the eye.'

40:42.250 --> 40:43.917
'And I'm not saying
I mind sitting there

40:44.000 --> 40:47.167
'with my weapons system turned
off waiting to be splashed.'

40:47.250 --> 40:48.875
I'm just saying
the next time this happens--

40:48.958 --> 40:50.625
(Ivanova)
If there is a next time.

40:50.708 --> 40:53.833
If someone could, oh, I don't
know, maybe explain it to me.

40:53.917 --> 40:56.000
This would definitely
be a good thing for my

40:56.083 --> 40:58.125
limited and admittedly
subjective point of view.

40:58.208 --> 41:01.333
You catch that? He wants
explanations, he wants logic.

41:01.417 --> 41:02.708
Ah, logic is a good thing.

41:02.792 --> 41:03.875
What it has to do
with the Earthforce

41:03.958 --> 41:05.125
is anybody's guess.

41:05.208 --> 41:06.833
Yeah, I suppose.

41:06.917 --> 41:09.792
So, what does everybody think
of our new captain?

41:09.875 --> 41:11.375
Well, I haven't seen
too much of him

41:11.458 --> 41:13.167
but what I have seen, I like.

41:13.250 --> 41:14.917
I think he's gonna be okay.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.833
- Susan?
- I agree.

41:16.917 --> 41:18.833
It's funny, he was supposed
to meet us here for drinks.

41:18.917 --> 41:20.750
I wonder what could be
hanging him up?

41:20.833 --> 41:23.208
Well, the last time I saw him
he said something about

41:23.292 --> 41:26.167
having a half hour
to give some good-luck speech

41:26.250 --> 41:27.792
or it wouldn't count..

41:27.875 --> 41:29.583
When was that?

41:29.667 --> 41:31.500
About 20 minutes ago.

41:31.583 --> 41:33.042
[chuckling]
Oh, no.

41:33.125 --> 41:36.083
Of all the times
he could have picked.

41:36.167 --> 41:38.250
It was an early Earth president

41:38.333 --> 41:40.292
Abraham Lincoln.

41:40.375 --> 41:42.833
Who best described
our situation.

41:45.042 --> 41:48.250
"The dogmas of the quiet past

41:48.333 --> 41:51.792
"are inadequate
to the stormy present.

41:53.750 --> 41:56.250
"The occasion is piled high
with difficulty

41:56.333 --> 41:59.167
"and we must rise
to the occasion.

42:00.958 --> 42:02.583
"We cannot escape history.

42:04.208 --> 42:07.583
"We will be remembered
in spite of ourselves.

42:10.417 --> 42:12.958
"The fiery trial
through which we pass..

42:14.333 --> 42:18.417
"...will light us down
in honor or dishonor..

42:18.500 --> 42:20.125
"...to the last generation.

42:22.917 --> 42:25.375
"We shall nobly save..

42:26.375 --> 42:27.917
"...or meanly lose.

42:29.375 --> 42:33.125
Our last, best hope of Earth."

42:34.042 --> 42:37.125
[instrumental music]

42:44.125 --> 42:45.875
Five minutes to spare.

43:05.750 --> 43:08.292
[theme music]
