35:29.460 --> 35:32.209
But I sunk so low, I went
and creeped on Evita.

35:32.210 --> 35:33.459
You didn't.

35:33.460 --> 35:34.999
Yeah...

35:35.000 --> 35:36.579
How'd she look?

35:36.580 --> 35:38.629
Perfect, of course.

35:38.630 --> 35:39.869
And happy.

35:39.870 --> 35:41.829
I was happy for her, too,
you know? But...

35:41.830 --> 35:43.290
then this guy...

35:44.500 --> 35:47.460
good-looking guy... walked up
to her, and she rebuffed him.

35:48.710 --> 35:51.979
So, that kinda made me happy,
in a selfish way.

35:52.004 --> 35:54.039
- [ripping]
- An understandably selfish way.

35:54.040 --> 35:56.329
Then she seemed sad, you know?

35:56.330 --> 35:58.829
Realized it was probably my fault.

35:58.830 --> 36:02.749
- Made me want... I don't know.
- [ripping]

36:02.750 --> 36:05.459
- Lose your shirt.
- Pfft, what?

36:05.460 --> 36:06.750
Take off your shirt.

Seriously?

36:32.540 --> 36:35.289
[ripping]

36:35.290 --> 36:37.394
All right, all right,
did you have to rip it?

36:37.419 --> 36:39.789
Yeah, you're literally
a fashion emergency.

36:39.833 --> 36:41.792
Why so intent on doing this, anyway?

36:41.793 --> 36:43.752
O'Reilly trusted me.

36:43.753 --> 36:45.672
I messed up, and I messed up again.

36:45.673 --> 36:47.792
You're even OCD about karma, aren't you?

36:48.391 --> 36:50.524
Everything folded.

36:50.583 --> 36:52.577
What if it doesn't work?
When I get there,

36:52.602 --> 36:54.252
what if I get blind-sided again?

36:54.253 --> 36:56.043
That's why you have me.

36:57.689 --> 37:00.713
- I'm glad I do have you.
- Me too.

37:02.205 --> 37:04.154
And I like this.

37:04.713 --> 37:06.247
You and me...

37:06.413 --> 37:08.583

37:15.583 --> 37:17.122
waffles or pancakes?

37:17.123 --> 37:18.276
What?

37:18.301 --> 37:19.837
When you hold hands with your girl,

37:19.862 --> 37:23.055
do you interlace your fingers like this?

37:23.080 --> 37:24.274
[quietly] Waffles.

37:24.299 --> 37:26.157
Or do you...

37:26.182 --> 37:28.717
do palms flat? Pancakes.

37:28.742 --> 37:30.694
Waffles?

37:30.742 --> 37:32.661

37:45.031 --> 37:46.569
Do what?

37:46.570 --> 37:49.239
We just walked past a whole
group of people waitin'.

37:49.240 --> 37:51.609
Yeah! Lines are for losers.

37:51.610 --> 37:53.659
Are you a loser, Tyrone Johnson?

37:53.660 --> 37:55.739
I mean, I've waited in,
like, a bunch of lines...

37:55.740 --> 37:58.328
Hey, where'd you say this sit-down was?

37:58.370 --> 38:00.570
- Back kitchen.
- Over there.

38:01.963 --> 38:04.713
- So lay out the plan for me.
- All right, so,

38:04.780 --> 38:06.736
O'Reilly said her end game
is getting, uh,

38:06.760 --> 38:08.681
confessions from higher-ups, so...

38:08.706 --> 38:11.705
The bosses are meeting in there,
I just gotta get this recorder in,

38:11.780 --> 38:13.842
the moment before they talk.

38:18.073 --> 38:19.612
Look, I'm gonna get a little closer.

38:19.637 --> 38:21.201
Okay, I got your back.

38:21.226 --> 38:22.936

39:44.882 --> 39:47.076
just hang out until it's over
and I can collect the recorder.

39:48.990 --> 39:50.349
