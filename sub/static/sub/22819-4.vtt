WEBVTT

01:07.026 --> 01:08.027
Bjorn.

01:10.697 --> 01:11.739
Bjorn. Wake up!

01:21.708 --> 01:24.461
- Hold your line!
- More tight.

01:31.885 --> 01:33.511
The Pillars of Hercules!

01:34.345 --> 01:35.722
There to starboard.

01:36.222 --> 01:37.223
What?

01:37.515 --> 01:38.725
Those mountains.

01:39.392 --> 01:42.061
Known to the Ancients
as the Pillars of Hercules.

01:42.812 --> 01:44.981
But, to our purpose,
more importantly,

01:45.315 --> 01:48.109
they mark the entrance
to the Mediterranean Sea.

01:49.986 --> 01:52.780
How fortunate I was
to run into you, Sinric.

01:58.912 --> 02:00.205
What are you thinking?

02:01.498 --> 02:04.250
How lucky we are
the gods gave us
this opportunity.

02:05.585 --> 02:09.839
For what lies ahead
are new cities, worlds,
people, and places.

02:11.466 --> 02:13.843
Ah, my father would have
relished this opportunity.

02:15.678 --> 02:18.181
I would still urge caution
about these lands and peoples.

02:18.640 --> 02:20.141
They will not know
who you are,

02:20.934 --> 02:24.312
and you in turn don't know
how strong anyone is
in this new world.

02:28.566 --> 02:30.068
I want to go to Rome.

02:31.402 --> 02:33.112
Rome is at the center
of the map.

02:33.196 --> 02:35.156
Rome is the center
of the new world.

02:35.240 --> 02:36.991
Not anymore, Bjorn Ironside.

02:38.451 --> 02:40.954
Since this map was drawn,
the whole world has changed.

02:41.246 --> 02:43.081
The Roman Empire is no more.

02:43.164 --> 02:44.666
Its power is mostly gone.

02:44.999 --> 02:47.627
What's left is just
a sad shadow
of its former glory.

02:49.295 --> 02:51.005
Then if not Rome, then where?

02:51.256 --> 02:53.716
There is an island,
not so far away.

02:54.384 --> 02:55.760
It's an interesting place.

02:58.137 --> 03:01.224
And what do they call
this interesting island?

03:03.518 --> 03:04.811
Sicily.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.008
Even though we saw
some of their armies leave,

03:35.091 --> 03:37.677
we cannot be sure
that they are much weakened.

03:37.760 --> 03:39.178
And after all, Alfred,

03:39.262 --> 03:41.848
it is our armies
which suffered
terrible defeat and loss.

03:42.265 --> 03:43.808
So, in truth,
we cannot think of attacking

03:43.891 --> 03:45.476
and trying to reclaim
the town.

03:46.311 --> 03:47.312
I agree.

03:47.687 --> 03:49.647
That is why I wonder
if it was wise of you

03:49.731 --> 03:50.982
to dismiss their peacekeepers.

03:51.482 --> 03:53.109
They didn't come here
to make peace.

03:53.776 --> 03:54.861
They came here
to make trouble.

03:56.070 --> 03:58.156
You cannot trust them.
They are heathens.

03:58.489 --> 04:00.408
Well, then, we must retreat.

04:00.742 --> 04:01.993
Return to Wessex.

04:02.201 --> 04:05.580
Raise another army
and leave them, for now,
in possession of York.

04:05.663 --> 04:07.915
I disagree.

04:07.999 --> 04:09.083
We have no choice.

04:09.250 --> 04:10.293
On the contrary.

04:11.502 --> 04:12.837
I don't understand.

04:13.838 --> 04:15.006
I had a vision.

04:16.466 --> 04:18.426
I saw the two witnesses
who are the prophets

04:18.509 --> 04:20.136
standing before
the god of the earth.

04:21.012 --> 04:22.805
And if any man
should harm them,

04:23.514 --> 04:26.184
fire would proceed
from their mouths
and devour their enemies,

04:27.101 --> 04:30.063
and if any man
should harm them,
he must be killed.

04:32.607 --> 04:34.567
You speak in riddles,
Bishop Heahmund.

04:35.360 --> 04:36.819
What I saw was real.

04:38.279 --> 04:41.658
I saw all the dead bodies
of the wicked lying in
the street of the great city,

04:42.158 --> 04:43.868
for there was no one left
to bury them.

04:44.702 --> 04:47.121
And I saw
that this great city

04:47.497 --> 04:52.585
was York,
and all those dead bodies
were of pagan Northmen.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.380
They died
because they starved.

04:56.130 --> 04:58.966
They died because
they had nothing to eat

04:59.217 --> 05:00.468
and nothing to drink

05:00.802 --> 05:02.470
and were walled up
in a great city.

05:03.429 --> 05:04.972
Is that what we should do?

05:05.973 --> 05:07.183
Yes.

05:07.684 --> 05:09.227
Close all roads to York.

05:09.560 --> 05:10.770
Blockade all rivers.

05:11.604 --> 05:14.065
Prevent the Northmen
from coming and going.

05:14.607 --> 05:17.110
And, in that way,
trap them,

05:17.527 --> 05:20.446
starve them,
force them to surrender.

05:21.656 --> 05:23.157
And when
they realize our plan,

05:24.325 --> 05:26.035
they might emerge
and attack us,

05:26.327 --> 05:28.162
while our forces
are much depleted.

05:32.375 --> 05:33.501
What do you say, Father?

05:37.505 --> 05:41.801
I say, you go and order
our commanders
to close the roads,

05:42.051 --> 05:44.679
the rivers,
passageways that lead to York.

05:45.346 --> 05:46.639
We will starve them out.

05:47.098 --> 05:48.099
With God's help.

05:48.182 --> 05:50.476
Oh, He will help us,
King Aethelwulf.

05:52.228 --> 05:53.229
Be assured of it.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.039
Ubbe!

06:13.666 --> 06:14.876
Ubbe!

06:16.294 --> 06:17.336
Ubbe!

06:39.776 --> 06:43.029
You're more
than ever welcome back
to our hearth, Ubbe.

06:55.958 --> 06:59.378
We have all heard
of the successes
of our Great Army,

07:00.338 --> 07:02.799
how you revenged
Ragnar's death,

07:03.716 --> 07:06.552
overcame both
Aelle and Ecbert.

07:06.928 --> 07:08.179
I thank my own son,

07:08.513 --> 07:11.307
but also you
and all the sons of Ragnar

07:11.682 --> 07:12.975
for these immortal events.

07:14.477 --> 07:17.188
Then you must have heard
of Sigurd's death
at the hands of Ivar.

07:17.939 --> 07:20.900
And his challenge to Bjorn
that he was the leader
of the Great Army.

07:23.236 --> 07:24.654
I want to tell you both,

07:26.739 --> 07:29.075
Bjorn Ironside behaved himself
throughout with

07:29.867 --> 07:31.202
great honor and courage.

07:32.203 --> 07:34.038
I love and admire him
as a brother.

07:35.706 --> 07:37.291
Thank you
for your words about Bjorn.

07:38.167 --> 07:40.545
He is a good man.
I know that.

07:41.087 --> 07:42.964
But Ivar is a different story.

07:44.632 --> 07:45.925
He tore us apart.

07:47.927 --> 07:50.429
As far as I am concerned,
I am now at war with Ivar.

07:53.808 --> 07:57.687
My brother Hvitserk,
he has decided with Ivar.

07:58.646 --> 08:00.022
So he is now my enemy.

08:10.408 --> 08:11.826
Let us make a pact.

08:12.952 --> 08:15.413
I will support you against
Ivar and Hvitserk

08:16.789 --> 08:19.375
if you agree to support me
against King Harald.

08:22.086 --> 08:24.964
You see, that would make me
an ally of my mother's killer.

08:25.047 --> 08:27.008
Mmm. I know.

08:28.342 --> 08:30.845
Your choices
are all difficult, Ubbe.

08:32.013 --> 08:34.849
But, for the sake
of the good folk of Kattegat,

08:35.683 --> 08:36.726
can we not be allies?

08:46.193 --> 08:47.236
<i>Skol.</i>

08:47.904 --> 08:48.905
<i>Skol.</i>

08:54.410 --> 08:56.579
I had hoped
that Bjorn would return.

08:56.662 --> 08:57.747
Mmm.

08:58.581 --> 08:59.874
He will come back.

09:00.666 --> 09:01.667
I know he will.

09:02.919 --> 09:05.504
But, until then,
don't put all your trust
in Ubbe.

09:07.131 --> 09:08.257
Why do you say that?

09:08.841 --> 09:11.719
It's just that, after you,
Bjorn should rule Kattegat.

09:13.554 --> 09:16.432
Who knows what the gods
have in store for us?

09:43.000 --> 09:45.711
You understand
I won't be sharing you
with Hvitserk anymore.

09:46.754 --> 09:47.797
I'm glad.

09:48.756 --> 09:50.091
You're the man I married.

09:51.926 --> 09:53.594
You are my husband.

09:54.720 --> 09:57.264
Hvitserk is a traitor.
Mmm.

10:03.437 --> 10:05.481
I think Lagertha
is losing her power.

10:06.607 --> 10:08.109
I think the gods
have deserted her.

10:09.110 --> 10:10.152
I have seen it.

10:10.987 --> 10:12.947
I have
watched it happening.

10:13.447 --> 10:16.701
Her weakness when
she dealt with King Harald,
her uncertainty.

10:17.368 --> 10:18.494
He tricked her

10:19.161 --> 10:20.663
and made a fool of her.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.792
Truth is,
there is only one man

10:24.875 --> 10:27.128
who can replace Ragnar
as the ruler of Kattegat,

10:27.294 --> 10:28.879
and that man is not Bjorn,

10:29.422 --> 10:32.133
since Bjorn clearly
has no interest in Kattegat.

10:34.760 --> 10:35.970
It's you, Ubbe.

10:38.055 --> 10:39.223
And you know it.

10:55.948 --> 10:56.949
Sicily.

10:57.575 --> 10:59.660
Tell me about it.

11:00.202 --> 11:03.289
The ruler
is a Byzantine commander
called Euphemius.

11:04.081 --> 11:05.499
He is already legendary.

11:06.959 --> 11:09.128
His ambitions are so limitless

11:09.462 --> 11:12.757
that he attempted to overthrow
the Holy Roman Emperor.

11:14.884 --> 11:16.594
He failed
and came here to Sicily

11:18.012 --> 11:21.390
with his ambitions undimmed,
so far as I know.

11:22.933 --> 11:24.435
What is Byzantine?

11:27.021 --> 11:29.690
Who is the Holy Roman Emperor?

11:30.399 --> 11:31.734
Michael II.

11:32.151 --> 11:33.486
But don't worry about it.

11:33.903 --> 11:35.780
In a few months' time,
he may not be.

11:36.697 --> 11:38.491
All things change.

11:38.991 --> 11:42.369
This world is impermanent
and deceiving.

11:43.287 --> 11:45.080
Many things are not
what they seem.

11:47.458 --> 11:50.795
When we go ashore
in the morning,
remember we are traders.

11:53.798 --> 11:55.758
We will have
many adventures here

11:56.759 --> 11:58.552
and, if we live,

12:00.679 --> 12:03.057
many stories to tell
at the Great Hall.

12:06.894 --> 12:08.521
If we live.

12:25.871 --> 12:26.956
Shh.

12:59.697 --> 13:00.698
Gather
all their weapons.

13:02.700 --> 13:05.119
Well done.
That all of them?

13:09.999 --> 13:11.709
Looks like
they will go hungry again.

13:11.792 --> 13:12.835
Yes, my Lord.

13:22.803 --> 13:25.848
So, the hunting party
did not return today.

13:28.767 --> 13:29.768
I said, the hunting...

13:29.852 --> 13:31.020
I heard what you said.

13:37.026 --> 13:38.611
We are almost out of food.

13:40.070 --> 13:41.280
And there is sickness
in the town.

13:42.281 --> 13:43.657
What are we going to do?

13:43.908 --> 13:44.909
We have to do something.

13:45.409 --> 13:47.453
The Saxons
are in their own country.

13:47.536 --> 13:49.371
They can be reinforced
and grow stronger

13:49.455 --> 13:51.290
while every day
we just grow weaker...

13:51.373 --> 13:53.584
What are you really saying,
huh, brother?

13:53.918 --> 13:56.295
That I was wrong
not to negotiate
with the Saxons

13:56.378 --> 13:57.671
and that Ubbe was right?

13:59.006 --> 14:00.174
No.

14:00.674 --> 14:02.593
No? Are you sure?

14:04.428 --> 14:05.596
Ubbe was wrong.

14:06.055 --> 14:07.723
That's why
I didn't sail with him.

14:08.223 --> 14:09.600
But now you regret it?

14:10.267 --> 14:11.560
I just told you, no.

14:14.146 --> 14:17.024
Ubbe treated me
like his little faithful dog.

14:21.195 --> 14:24.031
I am no one's dog, Ivar.

14:31.872 --> 14:32.998
Woof, woof.

14:58.857 --> 15:01.151
Astrid was
spirited away from here.

15:01.235 --> 15:02.987
There was nothing
Lagertha could do.

15:03.237 --> 15:04.488
She was powerless.

15:05.406 --> 15:07.157
Isn't that more proof?
Proof?

15:07.616 --> 15:08.909
That the gods
have turned against her.

15:08.993 --> 15:10.536
How can you say that?

15:10.953 --> 15:12.705
You're talking about Lagertha.

15:13.622 --> 15:14.915
And you were just a slave.

15:15.290 --> 15:16.667
I am not a slave now,

15:17.292 --> 15:19.044
and, in my head, I never was.

15:19.795 --> 15:23.298
We are equal to Lagertha,
Torvi, you and me.
We are all equal.

15:23.382 --> 15:24.466
You are right,
Margrethe.

15:25.718 --> 15:27.928
We are all equal.

15:28.470 --> 15:30.097
I didn't know
you were listening.

15:31.098 --> 15:34.268
What does it matter?
If I wasn't listening,

15:34.935 --> 15:37.688
then the gods were listening.
It's all the same.

15:38.731 --> 15:41.025
I have no feelings
for you either way.

15:42.651 --> 15:45.112
I could kill you
for your talk of betrayal,

15:45.446 --> 15:48.198
but I am sick of betrayal.

15:48.907 --> 15:50.993
I have known betrayal
all my life.

15:51.076 --> 15:54.163
Every man I've ever known
has betrayed me.

15:54.246 --> 15:56.248
Now most women betray me.

15:56.582 --> 15:58.083
What am I supposed to think?

15:58.167 --> 16:00.085
Not every woman
wants to betray you.

16:00.461 --> 16:03.088
Of course not, Torvi,
but given the chance...

16:07.301 --> 16:10.846
Margrethe, conspire against me
if you want to.

16:12.097 --> 16:15.100
But, if you can find
the courage to be loyal,

16:15.184 --> 16:18.103
then I will respect you
like no other.

16:18.812 --> 16:21.273
You were a slave
who had no choice,

16:21.607 --> 16:25.444
but, now, now as a free woman,

16:27.321 --> 16:28.822
you choose to love me.

16:38.749 --> 16:40.000
Approaching!

16:40.584 --> 16:41.710
Look, riders.

16:43.253 --> 16:44.254
Who are they?

16:45.798 --> 16:48.675
Northumbrians.
My mother's people.

17:11.573 --> 17:13.450
Mannel.
Queen Judith!

17:14.284 --> 17:16.245
This is my cousin, Mannel.

17:16.954 --> 17:19.081
This is my husband,
King Aethelwulf.

17:19.456 --> 17:22.751
Sire, as Bretwalda,
King of Kings,

17:22.835 --> 17:26.088
I offer you my allegiance
and my absolute loyalty.

17:28.090 --> 17:29.591
You are more welcome
than I can say.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.553
There is much business
to be done here.

17:32.803 --> 17:34.930
This is my eldest son,
Aethelred.

17:35.347 --> 17:37.683
And Heahmund,
the Bishop of Sherborne.

17:37.766 --> 17:38.892
Bishop Heahmund,

17:39.393 --> 17:40.978
your reputation
as a religious scholar,

17:41.061 --> 17:43.147
and as a warrior,
goes before you.

17:43.564 --> 17:44.982
And since
I came here to fight,

17:45.232 --> 17:48.777
I can think of no two men
I'd rather stand beside
in the shield-wall

17:48.861 --> 17:51.029
than King Aethelwulf
of Wessex and Heahmund,

17:51.113 --> 17:53.073
the warrior bishop
of Sherborne.

17:53.157 --> 17:55.033
Don't flatter them too much.

17:55.701 --> 17:56.910
You'll make them vain.

17:57.828 --> 18:00.497
It's true. The Bible tells us
that all is vanity.

18:00.914 --> 18:03.292
And yet here we are
about God's work.

18:03.792 --> 18:06.628
The Bible also tells us
to show no mercy
to unbelievers.

18:07.087 --> 18:08.755
Against these devils
and pagans,

18:09.423 --> 18:11.633
we are the wrath of God.

18:13.594 --> 18:15.012
Please, come.

19:41.348 --> 19:42.599
What is he asking?

19:43.266 --> 19:44.518
If we are traders.

19:45.686 --> 19:47.354
Of course
we are traders.

19:47.437 --> 19:48.897
Look at how few boats
we brought.

20:30.689 --> 20:33.191
He says, "Welcome."

20:49.166 --> 20:52.335
Commander Euphemius
wants you to understand
that you are not the only

20:52.419 --> 20:54.421
Northmen who have appeared
in the Mediterranean.

20:55.756 --> 20:59.634
The Emperor Michael himself
has a personal bodyguard
of Rus Vikings

20:59.926 --> 21:01.261
from the Kievan Empire.

21:09.644 --> 21:12.773
Commander Euphemius
wants you to be
his bodyguards.

21:13.106 --> 21:15.400
He will pay you and your men
very well.

21:16.693 --> 21:18.195
It would be better
if you agreed.

21:21.364 --> 21:22.532
Tell him we agree.

21:57.275 --> 21:58.401
Who is she?

21:59.027 --> 22:00.362
Kassia.

22:14.751 --> 22:16.336
Her name is Kassia.

22:17.003 --> 22:19.631
Apparently,
she is a Christian. A nun.

22:20.549 --> 22:24.094
She was in charge
of a monastery
and writes holy songs.

22:24.386 --> 22:26.888
A nun? A woman of God?

22:38.150 --> 22:41.945
The Commander says
that he stole her from
the holy city of Byzantium.

22:42.195 --> 22:43.905
And that she is so famous,

22:43.989 --> 22:46.616
the Emperor sentenced him
to death for abducting her.

23:15.187 --> 23:17.480
Will I ever see
my son again?

23:18.690 --> 23:21.109
Yes. You will see him again.

23:22.360 --> 23:24.738
But in terrible circumstances.

23:28.158 --> 23:29.242
What do you mean?

23:29.576 --> 23:33.914
The consequences
of Ragnar's death
are not yet played out.

23:34.998 --> 23:38.084
You have only seen
the beginning of the end.

23:38.919 --> 23:42.047
So now prepare yourself
for what is to come.

23:43.548 --> 23:44.841
What is to come?

23:45.592 --> 23:46.676
Tell me!

23:46.760 --> 23:47.761
Why?

23:48.887 --> 23:52.224
Do you suppose
that you could change
your fate if you knew it?

23:53.266 --> 23:57.979
So now, after all,
you want to fetter yourself

23:58.063 --> 24:01.316
and bind yourself
in delusions?

24:01.399 --> 24:04.736
No! I was thinking of my son.
Only my son.

24:06.738 --> 24:08.031
It's a mother's weakness.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.784
I have told you
that you will see him again.

24:11.076 --> 24:12.702
Is that not enough?

24:14.412 --> 24:18.541
Too much knowledge
is an agony.

24:21.044 --> 24:22.545
Prepare yourself.

24:37.143 --> 24:38.186
Lord Odin,

24:40.188 --> 24:41.815
did I make the right choice?

24:45.402 --> 24:47.028
Give me a sign. Help me.

24:51.324 --> 24:52.575
What is my fate?

25:16.474 --> 25:17.475
Kassia.

25:18.268 --> 25:19.436
What about her?

25:20.353 --> 25:22.022
She's up there. Look.

25:26.860 --> 25:27.861
It's Sinric.

25:47.422 --> 25:49.424
We saw you.

25:49.507 --> 25:51.259
What was all that about,
my friend?

25:51.760 --> 25:54.763
I told you.
Nothing is as it seems.

25:55.472 --> 25:57.307
Meaning?

25:57.390 --> 26:01.269
Commander Euphemius
isn't really the commander
here after all.

26:03.563 --> 26:05.148
I don't understand.

26:05.815 --> 26:07.984
An Arab leader
called Ziyadat Allah,

26:08.193 --> 26:10.528
the Emir of Ifriqiya,
in Kairouan,

26:10.779 --> 26:13.948
agreed to invade the island
on Euphemius's behalf,

26:14.240 --> 26:15.992
in return
for a yearly tribute.

26:16.993 --> 26:17.994
Where is Kairouan?

26:18.870 --> 26:19.913
In Africa.

26:29.506 --> 26:30.673
And where is Africa?

26:31.132 --> 26:32.467
Another world.

26:34.344 --> 26:37.389
So this
Commander Euphemius,

26:39.015 --> 26:42.018
he is a,
uh, client ruler.

26:42.310 --> 26:43.728
He has no real power.

26:44.062 --> 26:45.313
So it appears.

26:47.524 --> 26:48.858
And Ziyadat Allah?

26:49.567 --> 26:50.568
At the moment,

26:50.652 --> 26:53.321
he is probably
the most important ruler
in the Mediterranean.

26:53.696 --> 26:55.949
Many, many stories
are told of him.

26:56.408 --> 26:59.244
Both Arabs and Christians
go to him to ask for favors,

26:59.327 --> 27:00.745
which he often grants.

27:00.954 --> 27:03.456
For it increases
his influence and his power.

27:05.417 --> 27:06.418
Have you met him?

27:06.501 --> 27:07.502
No.

27:07.877 --> 27:09.712
That was Kassia.

27:10.171 --> 27:11.172
Yes.

27:11.464 --> 27:14.676
So who was the man?

27:16.136 --> 27:19.222
I don't know.
But almost certainly a spy.

27:20.098 --> 27:21.516
They looked like lovers.

27:21.975 --> 27:22.976
It's possible.

27:23.726 --> 27:25.061
A spy for who?

27:25.145 --> 27:28.314
For the Emperor, perhaps,
or perhaps for Ziyadat Allah.

27:28.398 --> 27:30.316
Who can tell in this place?

27:30.775 --> 27:33.903
You wouldn't happen
to be conspiring

27:34.154 --> 27:35.947
against us,
now would you, Sinric?

27:36.030 --> 27:38.741
I was only trying to find out
what was going on here.

27:43.371 --> 27:44.664
Some wanderers

27:45.415 --> 27:47.333
are really gods in disguise.

27:48.877 --> 27:49.878
Are you?

27:54.174 --> 27:55.550
Do I look like a god?

28:03.099 --> 28:04.559
I want to meet
this Ziyadat Allah.

28:05.477 --> 28:06.478
Why?

28:07.228 --> 28:09.314
'Cause it seems like
he is the true leader.

28:27.290 --> 28:28.583
In my vision,

28:29.000 --> 28:31.419
I saw the bodies of the pagans
heaped in the streets,

28:32.504 --> 28:35.381
dead of disease
and starvation.

28:36.716 --> 28:38.593
And so it has come to pass.

28:39.802 --> 28:42.555
Now surely
they are burning their dead.

28:42.639 --> 28:43.890
Mmm.

28:43.973 --> 28:46.601
So, indeed, it seems.

28:50.522 --> 28:52.315
Let us fall upon them now.

28:53.942 --> 28:54.943
No.

28:56.986 --> 28:58.613
If you take my advice,

28:59.322 --> 29:01.491
let their condition worsen
further still.

29:02.575 --> 29:04.994
Let them suffer more dismay,

29:05.537 --> 29:07.664
until only creatures
of rags and bones

29:07.956 --> 29:09.415
wander the streets of York.

29:10.458 --> 29:11.668
Then we attack.

29:12.877 --> 29:16.214
Oh, we can't always
be guided by your "visions,"

29:16.422 --> 29:18.049
Bishop Heahmund, hmm?

29:18.633 --> 29:20.468
But surely you see
the signs for yourself.

29:20.552 --> 29:22.136
Now, I also see other signs,

29:23.429 --> 29:25.515
how you put yourself forward,

29:25.598 --> 29:28.518
above me, to take command.

29:28.851 --> 29:30.562
Even though
I am your king!

29:30.728 --> 29:31.813
Under God!

29:39.904 --> 29:41.197
Forgive me, Sire,

29:42.407 --> 29:43.658
King of Kings.

29:45.285 --> 29:46.911
I am your humble servant.

29:48.871 --> 29:50.164
Do with me as you will.

29:58.339 --> 30:01.968
I think you're not humble,
Bishop Heahmund.

30:03.177 --> 30:05.513
But, still,
you are my servant,

30:05.597 --> 30:07.015
as well as the Lord's.

30:07.390 --> 30:09.267
And we shall proceed together,

30:09.475 --> 30:11.102
for the sake of our country,

30:11.185 --> 30:12.937
for the sake of England.

30:15.231 --> 30:16.357
My King.

30:45.803 --> 30:47.096
I don't understand.

30:48.973 --> 30:51.559
What is it that you
do not understand, Hvitserk?

30:51.643 --> 30:55.104
I don't understand
why you pretend to burn
the bodies of our dead.

30:55.646 --> 30:58.274
It's part of my plan.
Ah.

30:58.900 --> 30:59.901
What plan?

31:03.529 --> 31:06.074
Did you really think
that I didn't have a plan?

31:06.449 --> 31:07.950
Of course I have a plan.

31:08.159 --> 31:10.870
I'm a cripple, not an idiot.

31:14.165 --> 31:16.876
I have found
something out, Hvitserk.

31:18.419 --> 31:21.839
The Romans were very clever.

31:22.799 --> 31:26.511
My plan is based upon
what I have found out.

31:27.261 --> 31:28.513
What is it?

31:28.971 --> 31:30.098
I need to know.

31:30.973 --> 31:33.351
And you will know, my brother.

31:34.477 --> 31:36.270
In good time.

34:11.509 --> 34:12.593
Astrid.

34:14.554 --> 34:17.056
I haven't seen you
for many days.

34:17.515 --> 34:18.724
You were avoiding me.

34:18.808 --> 34:20.059
Mmm. Naturally.

34:22.270 --> 34:23.563
Then why are you here now?

34:25.523 --> 34:26.983
I have made up my mind.

34:28.192 --> 34:29.402
To do what?

34:30.528 --> 34:32.071
I asked the gods for advice.

34:33.030 --> 34:34.865
I thought about my own life,

34:35.408 --> 34:37.076
my own ambitions and hopes.

34:38.661 --> 34:42.290
But there is only so much
that humans can do
to deny the force of fate.

34:45.876 --> 34:47.169
What is your decision?

34:49.547 --> 34:50.923
What kind of whale is that?

34:54.760 --> 34:55.845
A minke.

34:56.637 --> 34:58.097
And why do we hunt whales?

34:58.806 --> 35:02.143
Because every part
of the whale is useful.

35:03.019 --> 35:04.979
Down to the smallest drop
of its oil,

35:05.062 --> 35:07.273
which keeps our world alight.

35:08.482 --> 35:10.109
I think the whale is a god.

35:11.152 --> 35:12.945
And each killing a sacrifice.

35:14.739 --> 35:15.740
Don't you?

35:16.365 --> 35:17.742
What is your decision?

35:23.164 --> 35:24.248
I agree to marry you.

35:31.922 --> 35:33.007
Good.

35:34.634 --> 35:36.218
I couldn't have waited
any longer.

36:24.517 --> 36:25.976
So you come
to be married.

36:27.019 --> 36:28.688
You want to be man and wife.

36:28.938 --> 36:29.939
Yes.

36:30.356 --> 36:31.607
In the sight of the gods?

36:32.316 --> 36:34.485
In the sight
of Freyr and Freya?

36:35.569 --> 36:36.570
Yes.

36:37.279 --> 36:38.531
And are you agreeable?

36:40.658 --> 36:42.326
Is this what you want to do?

36:43.577 --> 36:44.704
Think carefully.

36:46.205 --> 36:49.417
For although the fetters
of marriage will be invisible,

36:49.959 --> 36:52.586
like the cords
that bind Fenrir,

36:52.878 --> 36:54.422
they will still bind you.

37:00.636 --> 37:03.431
Yes, it is what I want to do.

37:04.265 --> 37:05.266
Very well.

37:06.308 --> 37:10.312
Then we call upon the gods,
who are gathered invisibly
here round us,

37:10.604 --> 37:14.066
to bless and make fecund
this marriage.

37:15.067 --> 37:16.068
The ring.

37:41.469 --> 37:44.430
Perhaps my luck
has finally changed.

38:50.871 --> 38:52.623
Thank you, Allfather.

38:54.917 --> 38:56.293
Thank you.

39:39.253 --> 39:40.254
What does he say?

39:40.337 --> 39:41.338
That he won't go.

40:15.998 --> 40:18.667
He has changed his mind.
He will come.

40:19.752 --> 40:21.253
It was something she said.

40:22.463 --> 40:26.508
Yes.
It was something she said.

40:31.889 --> 40:33.307
Who is that woman?

40:36.894 --> 40:38.562
Perhaps she is the all-woman.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.523
Or perhaps just a pain
in the neck.

40:59.041 --> 41:00.042
Sire!

41:04.213 --> 41:05.214
Your Highness!

41:06.924 --> 41:07.925
What is it?

41:08.258 --> 41:10.844
They are gone.
The Northmen. The ships.

41:10.928 --> 41:12.012
They are all gone!

42:47.357 --> 42:49.067
Why are the rats above ground?
