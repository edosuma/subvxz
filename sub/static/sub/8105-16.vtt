WEBVTT

00:07.925 --> 00:11.344
- It's almost 11:00.
- She needs a lot of sleep these days.

00:11.470 --> 00:15.890
Please, Mrs. Bardach,
I haven't seen her for a week.

00:17.768 --> 00:19.644
- I'll see how she's feeling.
- Thank you.

00:19.770 --> 00:21.729
You know what to do.

00:34.785 --> 00:36.494
- All done?
- Yeah.

00:37.496 --> 00:40.373
I scrubbed for 45 seconds,

00:40.499 --> 00:44.252
did the nails, all the way down
to the elbows, the whole deal.

00:46.672 --> 00:47.880
- Are you sick?
- No. No, no.

00:48.006 --> 00:48.881
- Cough?
- No.

00:49.007 --> 00:50.550
- Sore throat?
- No, no. I just, I just...

00:50.676 --> 00:53.970
Sometimes I sneeze when I look
at lights. I always have.

00:54.096 --> 00:58.349
- I'm sorry, you better...
- I would never get her sick. Please.

01:05.607 --> 01:07.150
A mask.

01:07.276 --> 01:09.610
- Got me by the bouncer.
- She's crazy.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.946
She's let me out like six times
in the last two months.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.782
Every time's just to go to the hospital.
I'm a prisoner.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.075
It's okay.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.709
- It's ugly.
- No.

01:28.714 --> 01:31.215
I wasn't looking at the scar anyways.

01:36.513 --> 01:38.181
Take off your mask.

01:40.601 --> 01:43.186
If your mom comes in here, she...

01:43.312 --> 01:46.314
Hey. Give me a kiss or I'll kill you.

01:53.822 --> 01:57.784
Your skin... Are you okay?

02:07.920 --> 02:09.962
Melinda, can you...

02:10.088 --> 02:12.882
What's wrong? What's wrong?
Can you breathe?

02:14.051 --> 02:15.885
What's wrong? What's wrong?
Is it your heart?

02:16.011 --> 02:18.554
What's wrong? Mrs. Bardach!

02:24.937 --> 02:26.771
Melinda, Melinda,
I don't know how to use this.

02:26.897 --> 02:29.106
I've never used one of these before.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.833
What did you do to her?

03:48.896 --> 03:50.771
Cuddy called.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.149
I know. I saw the caller ID.

03:53.275 --> 03:56.068
Young girl, anaphylactic shock.

03:56.194 --> 03:57.361
You answered?

03:57.487 --> 04:00.323
Turns out,
that's what stops the ringing.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.825
It's a weird case.

04:04.995 --> 04:08.497
I thought you did the dishes last night?
It was your day.

04:08.624 --> 04:12.043
I did. Those are new. Midnight snack.

04:12.169 --> 04:15.755
For a midnight snack,
you made a pot roast,

04:15.881 --> 04:17.798
the same pot roast I made last night.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.342
Yeah.

04:19.468 --> 04:23.054
Actually, it was after midnight.
Today's your day, right?

04:24.139 --> 04:25.723
You want me out of here. I get it.

04:26.975 --> 04:29.101
- No, it's fine if you stay.
- The place I was gonna move,

04:29.227 --> 04:31.312
the guy never called.
Otherwise I'd already be there.

04:31.438 --> 04:33.314
- I said it's fine if you stay.
- Yeah.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.024
That's why you're making me miserable.

04:35.150 --> 04:38.611
Maybe I just wanna make sure
you do your fair share around here.

04:38.737 --> 04:40.821
- That...
- What's weird about it?

04:43.408 --> 04:45.618
The girl with the allergies.

04:45.744 --> 04:46.869
Yeah.

04:46.995 --> 04:49.622
- She's immunocompromised.
- What are you doing?

04:49.748 --> 04:52.583
- What? You asked me...
- You knew that I was interested.

04:52.709 --> 04:55.419
That gives you
a valuable bargaining chip.

04:55.545 --> 04:58.464
You could've had me doing dishes
for a week.

05:01.051 --> 05:02.176
Okay.

05:06.890 --> 05:10.643
The allergic reaction happened
while she was in a clean room.

05:18.902 --> 05:20.611
Why does she have a clean room
in her home?

05:20.737 --> 05:22.947
Heart transplant.
Immune system's in the toilet.

05:23.073 --> 05:26.659
So Mommy builds her little angel
a John Travolta-quality bubble.

05:26.785 --> 05:28.327
Six months after the transplant.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.413
She doesn't need to be confined
to a clean room.

05:30.539 --> 05:31.831
Six months without putting out,

05:31.957 --> 05:35.626
Dr. Cuddy doesn't need to wear
thong panties, but it's not our call.

05:35.752 --> 05:38.254
I was wondering when you'd get
around to my panties.

05:38.380 --> 05:39.672
She's had four days of workups.

05:39.798 --> 05:42.049
They've tested everyone who came
anywhere near that room,

05:42.175 --> 05:43.384
everything in the room.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.302
It's like an Agatha Christie mystery.

05:45.429 --> 05:47.805
Maybe it's not what was there,
it's what she was doing.

05:47.931 --> 05:50.516
Exercise allergy. Love it.

05:50.642 --> 05:53.602
What sort of exercise
could a strapping young man

05:53.729 --> 05:56.647
and a nubile teenage nymphet possibly...

05:56.773 --> 05:58.566
Mom was in the room within seconds.

05:58.692 --> 06:02.194
So the boyfriend brought in an allergen
and is lying about it.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.280
Or the girl snuck out,
and she's lying about that.

06:04.406 --> 06:06.699
Or the parents are lying about the
room being clean.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.827
These are your big ideas?
Somebody's lying?

06:09.953 --> 06:11.787
Hasn't let me down yet.

06:11.913 --> 06:15.583
Recheck Mom, Dad, the girl, the boy,
the room and the home.

06:18.837 --> 06:23.257
Any of you have a new soap, a detergent,
perfume?

06:23.383 --> 06:26.052
No, no. Barbara's really careful
about that stuff.

06:26.178 --> 06:28.137
And you haven't been outside recently?

06:28.263 --> 06:30.139
How could I? I'm trapped up there.

06:30.265 --> 06:31.766
You're not trapped. It's just safer...

06:31.892 --> 06:35.436
They won't even tell me the alarm code.
Just tell her I can go back to school.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.021
Until we clear this up...

06:37.147 --> 06:40.983
Fine. Find out what I'm allergic to,
and I'll stay away from it.

06:41.109 --> 06:44.153
Then I can go back to school, right?

06:45.864 --> 06:49.742
It's up to your parents,
but, medically, there's no reason...

06:49.910 --> 06:51.327
Told you.

06:51.453 --> 06:54.705
Could I speak to you outside
for a second, please?

06:59.002 --> 07:01.670
You know, this is hard enough
without you in there...

07:01.797 --> 07:05.132
- She asked me my opinion.
- She is 16 years old. Lie to her.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.926
When I was eight, my mom, she hated...

07:07.052 --> 07:09.845
I know. I need to loosen up.
I'm overprotective.

07:09.971 --> 07:12.473
I saw Finding Nemo. I get it.
I don't need another story.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.225
But you're not
just being overprotective.

07:14.351 --> 07:16.769
You're one of the most overprotective
parents I've ever seen.

07:16.895 --> 07:19.730
She has the best private tutors.
I let her friends visit.

07:19.856 --> 07:21.690
I'm not going to apologize.

07:21.817 --> 07:23.651
Just giving you my thoughts.

07:23.777 --> 07:26.445
She almost died
three times during her childhood.

07:26.571 --> 07:29.365
- Penicillin, bee stings, peanuts.
- I've seen her file.

07:29.491 --> 07:32.785
Six months ago, we leave her home alone
for the first time on a weekend.

07:32.911 --> 07:36.872
She goes out, buys one chocolate chip
cookie. Peanut butter in the dough.

07:36.998 --> 07:39.667
She's forgotten her EpiPen.
She drives to the hospital,

07:39.793 --> 07:43.838
passes out, has an accident.
Steering wheel crushed her chest.

07:43.964 --> 07:46.173
She ended up losing her heart.

07:47.175 --> 07:49.385
So when you say to me that

07:49.511 --> 07:53.764
I'm one of the most overprotective
parents you've seen, please,

07:53.890 --> 07:58.435
please introduce me to the ones
who were more protective

07:58.562 --> 08:01.730
so that I can find out
what they're doing right.

08:08.029 --> 08:11.323
She's allergic to having
a sucky social life.

08:11.449 --> 08:14.285
Give the parents a break.
They're just trying to keep her healthy.

08:14.411 --> 08:16.328
Everything in here's
labeled "Hypoallergenic."

08:16.454 --> 08:17.955
Check it anyway.

08:21.501 --> 08:22.710
Cameron.

08:24.963 --> 08:27.965
This place is cleaner
than her hospital room.

08:29.384 --> 08:31.051
No alarm on this window.

08:31.178 --> 08:32.261
That's a 20-foot drop.

08:32.387 --> 08:34.930
You can get to the tree from here.
There's some bark scraped off.

08:35.056 --> 08:38.100
Sure, heart-transplant girl swung down
there on a vine.

08:38.226 --> 08:41.353
Maybe she was hooking up with Tarzan and
Cheetah down by the elephant graveyard.

08:41.479 --> 08:45.566
Or Jane stayed in the tree house,
and Tarzan came up.

08:49.779 --> 08:53.699
Okay, I spent most of the night, Friday.

08:53.825 --> 08:56.911
But if her mom finds out about that,
she will totally freak.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.662
You guys had sex?

08:58.788 --> 09:00.414
Yeah, but, you know,

09:00.540 --> 09:03.375
I did everything I could
to make sure she wouldn't get sick.

09:03.501 --> 09:04.460
Latex allergy?

09:04.586 --> 09:06.754
What do you mean, like a condom?
We didn't...

09:06.880 --> 09:09.882
You had unsafe sex? The whole "unsafe"
thing didn't tell you something?

09:10.008 --> 09:13.844
Yeah, but, I mean, look. We didn't,
like, plan on it, you know? It just...

09:13.970 --> 09:16.430
I don't know. We're in love.
We've been dating for two years.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.934
Practically a lifetime.
How about a semen allergy?

09:20.060 --> 09:22.436
We're gonna need a semen sample.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.689
You can use the bathroom over there.

09:25.815 --> 09:29.026
- Right. How do I...
- Aim and shoot.

09:32.113 --> 09:35.157
And no thinking about Dr. Cameron.
We'll know.

09:35.951 --> 09:38.661
- We should tell her parents.
- Why stop there? Call the cops.

09:38.787 --> 09:39.703
Melinda's a minor.

09:39.829 --> 09:43.415
And if we nip it in the bud here,
teenagers will never again have sex.

09:43.541 --> 09:45.626
The parents will find out
when they get the bill anyway.

09:45.752 --> 09:48.545
So you're fine with them finding out as
long as you don't have to tell them?

09:48.672 --> 09:50.130
Pretty much.

09:54.094 --> 09:57.763
Too bad it's not you giving the sample.
We'd be done by now.

09:59.849 --> 10:02.643
Test was negative. No semen allergy.

10:02.769 --> 10:06.605
Boyfriend sneaks in to get his freak on
the night before the anaphylaxis.

10:06.731 --> 10:08.607
- I don't buy that it's unrelated.
- He loves her.

10:08.733 --> 10:11.485
He did everything he could to make
sure she wouldn't get sick.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.028
What does that mean?

10:13.154 --> 10:16.657
Love is an emotion certain people
experience, similar to happiness.

10:16.783 --> 10:19.285
No. Maybe I should give
a more relatable example.

10:19.411 --> 10:21.203
Oh, snap.

10:21.329 --> 10:24.999
What did he do to protect her,
Brillo Pad his privates?

10:25.125 --> 10:27.334
- I assumed he washed and he...
- Oh, good work.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.671
Assumptions are so much faster
than actual questions.

10:40.181 --> 10:41.724
You the boyfriend?

10:41.850 --> 10:45.561
- I need to borrow you.
- What is going on?

10:45.687 --> 10:49.315
Don't worry. I'll return him
in roughly the same condition.

10:55.697 --> 10:59.366
Did you take anything to stay healthy?
Something stronger than an apple a day?

10:59.492 --> 11:00.701
Is he okay?

11:00.827 --> 11:04.872
He's just tired from being in a coma
so long. What'd you take?

11:05.707 --> 11:08.625
- Don't worry. He can keep a secret.
- Right...

11:10.545 --> 11:14.006
Antibiotics? Penicillin?

11:14.132 --> 11:16.759
Any of those names ring a bell?

11:16.885 --> 11:21.221
Yeah. My friend Elliot, his dad had,
like, a whole bottle that

11:21.348 --> 11:26.727
he hadn't finished, so I swiped it
and took a bunch for, like, a week.

11:26.853 --> 11:30.356
I mean, there's no way I was gonna risk
breathing germs on Melinda.

11:30.482 --> 11:34.818
This is the one downside of teenage sex.
You're idiots.

11:34.944 --> 11:38.947
You almost killed your girlfriend.
She's allergic to penicillin.

11:40.700 --> 11:44.411
What, do you think there was still some
on my lips? I brushed my teeth.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.538
Think lower and more fun.

11:49.334 --> 11:55.172
- I mean, it can go through your stuff?
- Totally, dude.

11:55.298 --> 11:56.673
There's this administrator here,

11:56.800 --> 12:00.761
whenever she gets sick,
she just gives me the prescription.

12:01.513 --> 12:03.889
But, you know, they tested Melinda.

12:04.015 --> 12:06.767
They said she wasn't allergic
to my stuff.

12:06.893 --> 12:08.560
Yeah, four days later.

12:08.686 --> 12:13.190
By that time the penicillin was crusting
up a sock at the bottom of your hamper.

12:13.316 --> 12:15.984
Do you have to tell her it was my fault?

12:16.861 --> 12:17.945
No.

12:18.488 --> 12:20.364
Great part of being a grownup,

12:20.490 --> 12:22.825
you never have to do anything.

12:29.791 --> 12:32.918
You're releasing her? What happened?
What did you find out?

12:33.044 --> 12:35.546
Tests on your house ruled out
any environmental allergens.

12:35.672 --> 12:36.880
Yeah, but what caused this?

12:37.006 --> 12:39.425
We believe it's highly unlikely
that this set of circumstances

12:39.551 --> 12:42.678
- will repeat itself.
- What set of circumstances?

12:42.804 --> 12:46.932
It's good news. She's healthy.
But you might wanna talk to...

12:47.058 --> 12:48.976
Cameron!

12:49.102 --> 12:51.103
I can't breathe.

12:51.229 --> 12:52.771
Getting the epi.

12:55.066 --> 12:56.233
Give her the shot!

12:56.359 --> 12:58.694
No murmurs, no friction rubs...

12:58.820 --> 13:00.779
- What are you waiting for?
- Quiet.

13:00.905 --> 13:03.574
She's coughing up white
sputum.

13:03.700 --> 13:06.118
Crackling two-thirds of the way up.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.246
Look at her neck.

13:09.372 --> 13:11.498
Please, she is vomiting.
Would you give her the shot?

13:11.624 --> 13:14.042
It's not an allergy. It's her heart.

13:19.674 --> 13:22.676
What's the good news?
What's the bad news?

13:22.802 --> 13:24.636
Congestive heart failure.

13:24.762 --> 13:25.762
Is which?

13:25.889 --> 13:27.598
- Good news.
- Why?

13:28.308 --> 13:30.934
I don't know. It just sounded like you.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.855
New puzzle piece, always good news.
What's the bad news?

13:34.981 --> 13:38.192
We've got two puzzle pieces
from two different puzzles.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.651
Seems that way.

13:39.777 --> 13:42.529
What if her anaphylaxis
wasn't anaphylaxis?

13:42.655 --> 13:45.157
Toxicity from the anti-rejection meds
could cause a seizure

13:45.283 --> 13:46.742
and then heart failure.

13:46.868 --> 13:50.704
And get cured by a mommy-wielded
EpiPen? It's anaphylaxis. What else?

13:50.830 --> 13:52.664
What if they really are two puzzles?

13:52.790 --> 13:56.210
You think she had two unrelated
rare conditions in one week?

13:56.336 --> 13:59.713
- We explained the anaphylaxis.
- What do you mean "we"? I did.

13:59.839 --> 14:03.675
At least I thought I did.
Maybe I didn't. Still, it was all me.

14:03.801 --> 14:07.846
And heart problems aren't so rare for
someone who's had a heart transplant.

14:07.972 --> 14:10.724
I say we assume House was
right about the anaphylaxis.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.601
It is tempting.

14:12.727 --> 14:17.314
Heart failure could be either infection,
coronary disease, or rejection.

14:17.440 --> 14:18.732
Sorry.

14:18.858 --> 14:22.528
There's a reason they call it
the whiteboard. It's not my rule.

14:22.654 --> 14:25.656
What ties
both these conditions together?

14:34.958 --> 14:38.418
Okay, we can all stare at each other,
or we can investigate

14:38.545 --> 14:41.838
what caused the heart failure.
Just the heart failure.

14:42.840 --> 14:45.259
You wanna give me that black marker?

14:51.766 --> 14:53.684
There's no fever,
so it's probably not infection.

14:53.810 --> 14:55.936
Or no fever because she's been
on immunosuppressants

14:56.062 --> 14:57.187
for the last six months.

14:57.313 --> 15:00.816
Let's do a CT,
get a heart biopsy, and then redo...

15:02.735 --> 15:05.362
- Anything?
- Not yet.

15:05.488 --> 15:08.407
So I hear you don't want
teenagers having sex.

15:08.533 --> 15:10.826
Teen suicide rate
isn't high enough for you already?

15:10.952 --> 15:14.162
I think those two are brats. The girl
undercuts her mom any chance she gets.

15:14.289 --> 15:17.749
Yeah, it's the daughter's fault. Nothing
to do with Mom infantilizing her.

15:17.875 --> 15:20.168
Good point. Explains why parents
who don't pay attention

15:20.295 --> 15:22.087
get such nice, well-adjusted children.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.797
What's this?

15:23.965 --> 15:26.550
- You think it's vegetation?
- Yeah.

15:26.718 --> 15:29.428
The kind made of muscle
that opens your heart valves.

15:29.554 --> 15:32.764
It's nothing. She's clean.

15:34.642 --> 15:35.809
It's good news.

15:35.935 --> 15:39.104
You don't show any signs
of coronary artery disease.

15:39.230 --> 15:40.397
So what's next?

15:40.523 --> 15:44.484
Well, blood work to rule out infection,
and then a heart surgical biopsy

15:44.611 --> 15:45.986
to rule out rejection.

15:46.112 --> 15:49.531
But you don't think you're gonna
rule out both things, do you?

15:49.657 --> 15:50.699
No.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.454
I'm gonna lose this heart, right?

15:55.580 --> 15:57.998
Hopefully we'll find the problem
and fix it.

15:58.124 --> 16:01.043
- You'll keep your heart a long time.
- How long?

16:01.169 --> 16:05.672
There could be drug breakthroughs that
allow you to keep it for decades more.

16:05.798 --> 16:09.593
Yeah. That's the answer
my cardiologist always gives me.

16:09.719 --> 16:13.639
I looked it up on the web.
It's like five or 10 years, right?

16:16.225 --> 16:18.352
That's about the average.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.979
That's why I need to have a life.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.900
Why can't you convince my mom
to let me go back to school?

16:25.026 --> 16:29.446
Melinda, you've got bigger worries right
now than missing school.

16:29.572 --> 16:31.657
Until we figure out what's wrong
with your heart,

16:31.783 --> 16:34.493
the safest place for you to be
is right here.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.417
Where's...

18:07.545 --> 18:09.629
...the hooker, I assume?

18:09.756 --> 18:11.506
Right up here, buddy.

18:14.719 --> 18:18.930
You said you'd hang the stethoscope
if you were having sex.

18:19.056 --> 18:21.391
I didn't say it had to be
with another person.

18:21.517 --> 18:25.312
Can you think of anything that would tie
together anaphylaxis and heart failure?

18:25.438 --> 18:29.399
No. I was waiting out there for hours!

18:29.525 --> 18:31.401
Yeah, well, I need a lot of foreplay.

18:31.527 --> 18:33.820
And then there's
the cuddling afterwards.

18:34.530 --> 18:38.450
Any way that anaphylaxis isn't
anaphylaxis even if it responds to epi?

18:38.576 --> 18:40.494
No. Oh, no wonder you were in the mood.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.163
This month's New Jersey
Journal of Cardiology.

18:43.289 --> 18:47.250
Have you seen the centerfold?
There's no way those valves are real.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.753
Any chance that the heart failure
could be unrelated to...

18:49.879 --> 18:54.466
No. If you need time alone to work,
you just have to say so.

18:54.592 --> 18:56.551
- You don't have to lie about it.
- Lying's more fun.

18:56.677 --> 18:59.262
Being lied to... Not as much fun.

18:59.388 --> 19:02.808
Please have an answer to this question.
What's for dinner?

19:02.934 --> 19:05.477
You still haven't done the dishes?

19:05.645 --> 19:08.271
You want one of these?
I think I got a couple of blueberries.

19:08.397 --> 19:11.274
Oh, nope. Sorry, just one.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.321
Well, don't look all weepy.

19:16.447 --> 19:20.867
You got a problem with me, deal with it.
Short my sheets or something.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.501
Biopsy was negative
for rejection.

19:29.627 --> 19:30.544
Thank God.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.296
- And what about the blood tests?
- Showed no infection.

19:33.422 --> 19:36.508
So we still don't know what caused
her heart failure.

19:36.634 --> 19:38.510
Let's just be happy
she doesn't need a new heart.

19:38.636 --> 19:41.221
Mrs. Bardach, it could have just been
a one-time thing.

19:41.347 --> 19:43.431
So she has an allergic reaction
and heart failure,

19:43.558 --> 19:46.268
and neither of them can be explained.

19:46.394 --> 19:48.228
- Are they doing any more tests on her?
- No.

19:48.354 --> 19:49.771
She's not here.

19:52.233 --> 19:55.902
Notify local hospitals, cab companies,
the state troopers, and local cops.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.321
Any security officers off duty
are back on duty.

19:58.447 --> 19:59.489
We're on it.

19:59.615 --> 20:02.450
And I'm gonna need some pictures.
And go through those drawers.

20:02.577 --> 20:05.912
And I want at least two people
going over the surveillance tapes.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.873
Will that work?

20:07.999 --> 20:10.458
- Are those all her clothes?
- Yeah.

20:11.085 --> 20:13.336
She's obviously still in the building.
So where did she go?

20:13.462 --> 20:16.798
- What does she want?
- See her boyfriend?

20:16.924 --> 20:18.967
She didn't take her phone.

20:19.468 --> 20:21.344
She wants to be outside.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.402
If you're trying to scare your parents,
great job.

20:39.322 --> 20:41.031
Can we go back now?

20:42.283 --> 20:43.491
I hate her.

20:45.703 --> 20:49.164
When I was eight years old, I was sick.

20:49.874 --> 20:52.292
Not really sick, but the point is,
my mom, she could...

20:52.418 --> 20:55.337
She was like this before.
Home by 9:00 every night.

20:55.463 --> 20:58.381
Can't go out on the weekends.
Can't do sports.

20:58.507 --> 21:00.467
Transplant just gave her
what she always wanted.

21:00.593 --> 21:03.762
Melinda, you had heart failure.

21:04.513 --> 21:07.807
This is kind of an insane time
to be criticizing your mom

21:07.934 --> 21:09.267
about being overprotective.

21:09.393 --> 21:12.979
I know. I mean,
this is what makes it even worse.

21:13.105 --> 21:16.274
All of her craziness,
it just...

21:18.486 --> 21:20.403
It makes sense now.

21:20.529 --> 21:23.031
Everything's gonna be all right.

21:23.616 --> 21:26.034
I didn't even try to get outside.

21:27.578 --> 21:29.704
- I was too scared.
- Come on.

21:41.217 --> 21:44.511
Whoa, whoa, Melinda.
Please walk back towards me.

21:45.346 --> 21:46.471
Why?

21:47.390 --> 21:48.348
Please.

21:53.854 --> 21:55.730
It feels kind of weird.

21:58.025 --> 22:00.151
It's called steppage gait.

22:00.277 --> 22:02.529
- Is it serious?
- Not necessarily.

22:03.364 --> 22:06.116
All right. Stick your leg out.
Hold it up.

22:07.535 --> 22:10.996
She was under anesthesia for the biopsy.
If she lost oxygen...

22:11.122 --> 22:13.123
CT ruled out brain damage.

22:13.791 --> 22:16.376
Put your leg down. Relax.

22:19.588 --> 22:21.923
Why is her leg twitching like that?

22:23.009 --> 22:25.802
- Fasciculation.
- Is that serious?

22:25.928 --> 22:28.555
It's paralysis, and it's ascending.

22:29.015 --> 22:31.516
She's gonna lose the use of her legs?

22:35.438 --> 22:36.813
To start with.

22:42.445 --> 22:45.113
It's ascending fast.
She can hardly extend her leg now.

22:45.239 --> 22:48.992
At this rate, it'll be up to her lungs
in a matter of days.

22:49.118 --> 22:53.496
So, anaphylaxis, heart failure,
paralysis.

22:53.622 --> 22:55.165
We couldn't put the first two together.

22:55.291 --> 22:57.083
I'm guessing we can't put
all three together.

22:57.209 --> 23:00.545
Tick paralysis? Could also explain
the anaphylaxis, maybe even the...

23:00.671 --> 23:03.214
Penicillin allergy explains
the allergic reaction much better.

23:03.340 --> 23:07.260
Particularly because tick paralysis is
usually accompanied by a tick.

23:07.386 --> 23:10.305
We did two comprehensive physicals
looking for insect bites.

23:10.431 --> 23:12.849
Can we put any two of those together?

23:12.975 --> 23:14.350
How about we stipulate?

23:14.477 --> 23:17.353
You argued that there must be
something to connect all three symptoms,

23:17.480 --> 23:19.147
you mocked us for not figuring it out,

23:19.273 --> 23:21.357
and finally you let us discuss
the paralysis on its own

23:21.484 --> 23:23.401
because it's what's gonna kill her.

23:23.527 --> 23:27.155
Now, it's ascending. Her MRIs are clean,
so rule out stroke or aneurysm.

23:27.281 --> 23:29.032
- ALS, MS?
- Too quick.

23:29.158 --> 23:31.159
- Spinal lesion from leukemia?
- Too slow.

23:31.285 --> 23:33.995
- It's most likely Guillain Barré.
- She's immunosuppressed.

23:34.121 --> 23:35.038
What about botulism?

23:35.164 --> 23:37.665
Not unless she's been walking
on her hands the last couple of days.

23:37.792 --> 23:39.751
Botulism paralysis is descending,
not ascending.

23:39.877 --> 23:43.004
Could be a virus. West Nile,
even polio with her immune system shot.

23:43.130 --> 23:46.341
Get an LP and do PCRs for the viruses.

23:46.467 --> 23:48.676
And get an EMG
to check for Guillain Barré.

23:48.803 --> 23:52.347
Foreman's right.
We gotta find out why she's paralyzed.

23:54.016 --> 23:57.560
But not before staring at me dumbly
for a few seconds.

24:07.947 --> 24:10.031
We ran more tests
on your daughter.

24:10.157 --> 24:13.409
We took a lumbar puncture,
got some spinal fluid.

24:13.536 --> 24:15.578
Then we brought it to the lab
to look for infections

24:15.704 --> 24:17.956
that could be affecting her brain.

24:19.959 --> 24:22.377
We also did an EMG to check
how her muscles and nerves

24:22.503 --> 24:25.255
are responding to electrical impulses.

24:25.381 --> 24:29.008
Unfortunately, her muscles are showing
increased weakness above the knee.

24:29.135 --> 24:30.969
You mean she's getting worse?

24:31.095 --> 24:34.097
The LP and PCRs ruled out
polio and West Nile.

24:34.223 --> 24:36.182
We think it's Guillain Barré.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.976
The body's immune response goes
haywire

24:38.102 --> 24:40.103
and starts attacking
the peripheral nerves.

24:40.229 --> 24:43.439
It causes muscle weakness and
paralysis.

24:43.566 --> 24:44.607
How bad is it?

24:44.733 --> 24:49.237
It's serious, but Guillain Barré usually
responds very well to plasmapheresis.

24:56.412 --> 24:59.038
You see, the plasma,
the clear liquid

24:59.165 --> 25:01.624
contains most of the antibodies
which are overreacting

25:01.750 --> 25:03.835
and attacking her nervous system.

25:03.961 --> 25:05.879
The machine spins her blood
in a centrifuge

25:06.005 --> 25:08.840
and separates parts of the blood
based on weight.

25:08.966 --> 25:11.301
White blood cells are the heaviest,
then the red cells,

25:11.427 --> 25:13.219
then platelets and plasma.

25:13.387 --> 25:15.597
We discard the stuff
that's causing all the trouble

25:15.723 --> 25:19.225
and return the good blood cells back
to her body in a replacement fluid.

25:19.351 --> 25:22.645
If it works,
we'll see results in a couple of days.

25:30.404 --> 25:33.281
You didn't get any messages for me
last week, did you?

25:33.407 --> 25:34.741
Nope.

25:34.867 --> 25:37.035
That's funny.
The guy finally called back.

25:37.161 --> 25:40.205
The place I lost,
he said he left three voicemails.

25:40.331 --> 25:41.164
Gotta pee.

25:41.290 --> 25:45.168
Which I never got, if that wasn't clear.

25:45.294 --> 25:48.922
He must be lying.
You wouldn't want to live with a liar.

25:49.048 --> 25:51.090
- You erased my messages?
- Yep.

25:51.217 --> 25:54.719
Decided I wanted you to stay.
Told you that, didn't I?

25:54.845 --> 25:58.848
You're miserable, and you're lonely,
and you're gonna trap me here

25:58.974 --> 26:00.934
to keep me every bit
as miserable and lonely, too.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.645
Yeah, and you're happy, happy, happy.

26:03.771 --> 26:07.315
Okay. Hey, I'm obviously going through
a rough patch here.

26:07.441 --> 26:10.068
Wife leaves, tends to bum somebody out.

26:11.237 --> 26:13.529
Do you know where my pee went?

26:15.991 --> 26:17.617
You're missing some?

26:17.743 --> 26:22.121
No. Came out of me and went right
into the toilet. Now, why would that be?

26:23.040 --> 26:25.959
You're William Tell. You could pick
an apple off someone's head?

26:26.085 --> 26:29.170
No, it's because there was
no clear plastic wrap over the toilet.

26:29.296 --> 26:31.297
The stuff's in the kitchen.
You had plenty of time.

26:31.423 --> 26:34.175
- All that was missing was the will.
- This isn't a college dorm.

26:34.301 --> 26:37.262
- It could be.
- We're not 18!

26:37.388 --> 26:41.683
So what? What did I do to you?
I scammed you into doing the dishes,

26:41.809 --> 26:45.228
I made you sit on the steps.
I didn't kill your puppy.

26:45.354 --> 26:49.399
- I did not make you miserable.
- Oh, so this is therapy?

26:49.525 --> 26:52.652
No, it just makes me smile.

26:54.196 --> 26:56.072
All right.
I'm finding a new place tomorrow.

26:56.198 --> 26:58.074
Right. But not tonight.

26:58.867 --> 27:01.536
Well, I figure you wanna shave
my eyebrows while I'm asleep.

27:01.662 --> 27:03.997
I wouldn't wanna deprive you
of that last smile.

27:04.123 --> 27:05.373
You're not going anywhere.

27:05.499 --> 27:08.501
You're gonna sit on my couch
and depress us both

27:08.627 --> 27:10.920
because you just can't admit
that it's over with your wife.

27:11.046 --> 27:14.007
- That's right. I'm here on vacation.
- Have you gotten a lawyer yet?

27:16.051 --> 27:19.137
- That... That's not...
- Have you even called one?

27:21.432 --> 27:24.475
As long as you're here,
it's just a fight.

27:24.601 --> 27:28.354
But as soon as you get a place,
then it's a divorce.

27:33.527 --> 27:35.069
Everything sucks.

27:36.405 --> 27:39.324
Might as well find something
to smile about.

27:50.419 --> 27:52.253
Reflexes are marginally
weaker.

27:52.379 --> 27:53.921
The paralysis is getting worse?

27:54.048 --> 27:57.258
Sometimes it takes a few treatments
for the plasmapheresis to work.

27:57.384 --> 28:00.219
Why do these things keep
happening to me?

28:02.765 --> 28:04.432
Dan's back.

28:04.558 --> 28:07.226
Hey, baby, did you hear that?
Dan's here.

28:08.812 --> 28:10.646
I don't wanna see him.

28:14.485 --> 28:17.070
- I'll tell him to come back later.
- No.

28:17.821 --> 28:19.822
Mommy, stay here, please.

28:22.076 --> 28:23.201
Of course.

28:57.277 --> 28:59.695
- Is she doing okay?
- She's sleeping.

28:59.822 --> 29:01.656
I'm sure she's exhausted.

29:01.782 --> 29:04.325
Mood swings are common
with the anti-rejection meds.

29:04.451 --> 29:06.744
No. She's had mood swings.
This isn't it.

29:06.870 --> 29:10.832
This is... She's given up.

29:13.210 --> 29:15.044
I know you think I'm...

29:17.214 --> 29:19.215
This isn't what I wanted.

29:21.885 --> 29:23.970
She's always fought with me.

29:24.972 --> 29:28.141
Ever since she was a baby,
she was so damn stubborn.

29:28.934 --> 29:31.477
But I never wanted her like this.

29:33.564 --> 29:35.440
I just wanted her safe.

29:36.859 --> 29:38.526
Doctor!

29:41.321 --> 29:44.907
She can't breathe.
She can't even get a whole sentence out.

29:47.494 --> 29:48.953
She's using the accessory muscles.

29:49.079 --> 29:50.955
- O2 sat's down to 90. Lungs clear?
- Yeah.

29:51.081 --> 29:52.957
Does your tongue feel swollen?
Is it itchy?

29:53.083 --> 29:55.460
- No hives.
- It's not an allergy.

29:55.586 --> 29:57.628
Lips are cyanotic.
We've got to intubate.

29:57.754 --> 29:59.255
What are you doing?

29:59.381 --> 30:00.965
Pushing lorazepam.

30:01.508 --> 30:05.386
She's not getting enough oxygen.
We've gotta assist her breathing.

30:15.063 --> 30:17.273
What was that?
Was that a reaction to the treatment?

30:17.399 --> 30:20.318
It's the paralysis.
It's reached her lungs.

30:29.411 --> 30:30.870
Melinda's dying.

30:30.996 --> 30:34.582
We're all dying. How fast?

30:34.708 --> 30:36.292
Too fast for Guillain Barré.

30:36.418 --> 30:39.337
Cuddy wants to get her an MRI
to rule out a spinal lesion.

30:39.463 --> 30:41.923
Cuddy? What's she doing on this?

30:42.925 --> 30:44.926
The family lost confidence in us.

30:45.052 --> 30:48.054
I don't blame them. I'll be right in.

31:02.653 --> 31:04.862
It's like she got poisoned
with a nerve agent.

31:04.988 --> 31:07.281
Glue inhalation. Would explain
why she hasn't admitted it.

31:07.407 --> 31:08.866
Tox screen was clear for pot.

31:08.992 --> 31:12.286
Middle-class heart transplant patient's
gonna huff glue?

31:12.412 --> 31:14.747
- Pesticides?
- They're not spraying.

31:14.873 --> 31:18.251
This girl's tough.
She gets what she wants.

31:19.002 --> 31:22.755
She's deprived of human contact.
She gets herself a backdoor man.

31:22.881 --> 31:25.967
Or in her case, a side-window boy.
What else has she been deprived of?

31:26.093 --> 31:28.302
She's on a special diet
because of her allergies.

31:28.428 --> 31:32.807
The boyfriend brings the hot beef.
He also brings a side dish, botulism.

31:32.933 --> 31:35.142
This paralysis is ascending, remember?

31:35.269 --> 31:37.562
Not if the heart problem's
really a paralytic problem.

31:37.688 --> 31:39.605
Why would she admit the sex
and not the food?

31:39.731 --> 31:41.941
She didn't admit anything.

31:42.067 --> 31:44.652
He admitted the sex,
and we didn't ask him about food.

31:44.778 --> 31:46.946
- Get me a rat.
- You have a rat.

31:47.072 --> 31:49.824
What? I'm not gonna kill Steve.

31:49.950 --> 31:53.661
Only way to confirm this,
inject a rat with her blood

31:53.787 --> 31:56.664
and wait for it to get all botulistic
on your ass.

31:56.790 --> 32:00.835
In the meantime, I'm going downstairs
to browbeat a scared dying teenage girl

32:00.961 --> 32:05.089
until she breaks down
like a scared dying teenage girl.

32:09.970 --> 32:11.929
- You're up early.
- Cuddy needed a consult.

32:12.055 --> 32:14.682
We're checking for spinal lesions
from leukemia.

32:14.808 --> 32:17.184
Yeah, I know. Fits perfectly.

32:17.311 --> 32:20.438
Unless this is the patient
with the anaphylaxis, the heart failure,

32:20.564 --> 32:22.898
and the paralysis, in which case,
you're wasting your time.

32:23.025 --> 32:24.191
We wanted a second opinion.

32:24.318 --> 32:26.277
Second?
We must have given you at least eight.

32:26.403 --> 32:30.948
Okay, well, here's nine. Botulism.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.784
Listen to me,
have you eaten anything abnormal?

32:33.910 --> 32:35.828
- Any canned foods?
- No.

32:35.954 --> 32:36.954
You sure?

32:37.080 --> 32:39.373
Lying to your parents is
usually the right thing to do,

32:39.499 --> 32:41.584
but there is
an impending death exception.

32:41.710 --> 32:42.835
Don't talk to her like that.

32:42.961 --> 32:45.713
You're right. She never lies.
I was being rude.

32:45.839 --> 32:49.634
When your boyfriend snuck in
on Friday night... Surprise.

32:49.760 --> 32:52.261
Perhaps he got you
some sexy little treats, huh?

32:52.387 --> 32:57.224
Some honey or some edible underwear,
some massage oils. Come on, anything.

32:58.477 --> 33:01.687
- We didn't...
- Yeah, yeah. We know about the sex.

33:01.813 --> 33:04.190
Turns out that Danny's little Danny is
full of penicillin.

33:04.316 --> 33:06.108
That's what caused
your anaphylactic shock.

33:06.234 --> 33:09.195
You didn't tell us that was what...

33:09.321 --> 33:13.199
No. It was...
He took clindamycin, what I use...

33:16.411 --> 33:18.329
He said he was on penicillin.

33:18.455 --> 33:21.916
- I saw the bottle.
- That's a non-penicillin antibiotic.

33:22.042 --> 33:24.377
If the antibiotics didn't cause
the anaphylaxis...

33:24.503 --> 33:26.337
It's still on the table.

33:26.463 --> 33:27.880
Everything is connected.

33:28.006 --> 33:29.924
What did we discuss?
What was the differential?

33:30.050 --> 33:31.509
Cameron said...

33:34.262 --> 33:37.807
When Dan came to your house that night,
he go through any tall grass?

33:37.933 --> 33:39.433
Climbed a fence.

33:45.273 --> 33:46.524
What are you doing?

33:46.650 --> 33:48.693
Your daughter had two visitors
on Friday night.

33:48.819 --> 33:53.364
One of them is still in the room.
She has tick paralysis.

33:54.491 --> 33:58.536
Dan tracked a tick onto his jeans,
which wouldn't be a problem.

33:58.662 --> 34:02.039
But being a teenager,
Dan couldn't keep his tick in his pants.

34:02.165 --> 34:04.041
We already checked her.

34:04.876 --> 34:05.835
Now I'm checking her.

34:05.961 --> 34:08.546
Tick bites don't ordinarily cause
anaphylactic shock.

34:08.672 --> 34:10.673
This girl's allergies are not ordinary.

34:10.799 --> 34:14.009
House, get out of here. We have to
re-intubate her, get her into the MRI.

34:14.136 --> 34:15.886
The time course is perfect.

34:16.012 --> 34:17.888
The bite itself sets off
an allergic reaction.

34:18.014 --> 34:20.182
Venom takes four days to kick in.

34:20.308 --> 34:21.934
Heart's vulnerable, hits that first,

34:22.060 --> 34:24.019
then a day later sets off
the ascending paralysis.

34:24.146 --> 34:26.105
Except that ticks aren't
usually invisible.

34:26.231 --> 34:28.023
They are until you find them.

34:30.068 --> 34:31.318
Oh, no. That's dandruff.

34:31.445 --> 34:33.738
Okay, well, that wasn't
nearly as dramatic as I'd hoped.

34:33.864 --> 34:36.824
It just means the next time will be
even better.

34:39.369 --> 34:41.746
- What's happening?
- That's the tick venom ascending.

34:41.872 --> 34:45.291
Either that or you stressed her
into heart failure. BP's dropping.

34:45.417 --> 34:48.085
- Heart rate, 47.
- I'm administering atropine.

34:48.211 --> 34:50.337
She's gonna need
a transvenous pacing wire.

34:50.464 --> 34:54.467
Okay, magical tick hunt is over.
Only real doctor stuff now.

34:54.593 --> 34:56.177
This is just gonna get worse.

34:56.303 --> 34:59.263
Ticks produce more toxins
the longer they feed.

34:59.389 --> 35:02.808
She's gonna be dead in an hour even
if you pump her heart full of jet fuel,

35:02.934 --> 35:05.227
- unless you let me find the tick.
- Could he be right?

35:05.353 --> 35:08.147
The only thing I know for sure is
that your daughter's heart won't last

35:08.273 --> 35:09.899
another 20 minutes without treatment.

35:10.025 --> 35:13.277
Okay, I just need one final instruction.
When I find the tick on the autopsy,

35:13.403 --> 35:16.947
do you want to know? I'm thinking not,
probably make the coping easier.

35:17.073 --> 35:18.574
Stop talking to them!

35:18.700 --> 35:21.035
Page Borsisky in cardiology.
Get her team down here stat.

35:21.161 --> 35:22.787
Get them out of here.
Get House out, too.

35:22.913 --> 35:25.414
Dr. Wilson, I could use your help.

35:26.666 --> 35:30.169
Well, I don't know if the dopamine's
enough. She may need inamrinone lactate.

35:30.295 --> 35:31.712
Why? What's that? She doesn't...

35:31.838 --> 35:34.632
She might need stronger pressors.
They don't have any in radiology.

35:34.758 --> 35:37.968
Inamrinone can cause arrhythmia
and thrombocytopenia.

35:38.094 --> 35:41.096
Not inamrinone could cause death.
Death's worse.

35:41.765 --> 35:44.016
We have to get her up to the ICU.

35:50.774 --> 35:54.777
Cardiac team
to ICU stat. Cardiac team to ICU stat.

35:58.281 --> 36:01.742
- Sorry, a little crowded here.
- House, get out of the elevator.

36:01.868 --> 36:03.702
You're welcome to wait for the next one.

36:03.829 --> 36:05.579
- You got her?
- Got her.

36:17.050 --> 36:20.302
As long as we're stuck here, this might
be a good time to look for that tick.

36:20.428 --> 36:23.931
- Turn the elevator back on.
- Just be a minute, honey.

36:32.190 --> 36:34.567
- Atropine's wearing off.
- So inject her again.

36:34.693 --> 36:36.652
- That's just temporary.
- Temporary's fine.

36:36.778 --> 36:37.987
We're not hanging wallpaper.

36:38.113 --> 36:40.489
We've gotta get her upstairs
and put her on norepinephrine.

36:40.615 --> 36:43.409
It wasn't penicillin. You still think
the symptoms are unconnected?

36:43.535 --> 36:45.244
We've gotta take care
of her heart before...

36:45.370 --> 36:47.246
You wake up in the morning,
your paint's peeling,

36:47.372 --> 36:49.290
your curtains are gone,
and the water's boiling.

36:49.416 --> 36:51.333
- Which problem do you deal with first?
- House.

36:51.459 --> 36:54.545
None of them. The building's on fire!
We treat her symptoms, she dies.

36:54.671 --> 36:57.840
We find the cause, she lives.
That tick is an IV drip of poison.

36:57.966 --> 37:00.050
We unhook it, she'll be fine.

37:08.727 --> 37:12.771
This is my last atropine.
Last us about three minutes.

37:12.898 --> 37:14.982
Let's get her gown up.

37:23.825 --> 37:27.244
Her heart rate falls below 35,
we're getting her to the ICU.

37:27.370 --> 37:30.205
I'm not gonna let her die
in this elevator.

37:35.003 --> 37:36.462
Where are they?

37:36.588 --> 37:39.006
Get maintenance up here, right away.

37:40.008 --> 37:42.635
- Ear canal's clean.
- Left foot's clean.

37:42.761 --> 37:46.680
If it's not here, we've only got...
Heart rate's 46.

37:46.806 --> 37:50.601
It's here. Looks like a mole
or a freckle, something we missed.

37:50.727 --> 37:52.311
Check the armpits.

37:56.775 --> 37:59.151
Dr. Foreman's an excellent doctor.
He'll be able to handle it.

37:59.277 --> 38:02.321
Yeah? You know that from experience?
You lose a lot of patients on elevators?

38:02.447 --> 38:04.531
The maintenance guy said
it didn't just stop on its own,

38:04.658 --> 38:07.117
that they hit the emergency stop button.

38:07.243 --> 38:09.870
Well, I'm sure he must be mistaken.

38:12.624 --> 38:14.166
- Perineum.
- We checked it.

38:14.292 --> 38:16.126
- If we get her upstairs, we still...
- Maxilla.

38:16.252 --> 38:17.461
Checked.

38:19.798 --> 38:22.091
Down to 38. We don't have a lot of time.
We can still...

38:22.217 --> 38:24.802
Eyebrows, eardrums, pubic hair.

38:24.928 --> 38:28.722
Checked, checked, checked.
We checked everywhere! It's not...

38:30.725 --> 38:31.809
Thirty-five.

38:31.935 --> 38:34.478
- We gotta get her to the ICU.
- We haven't found the tick yet.

38:34.604 --> 38:36.772
We already kidnapped her!
You wanna add murder?

38:36.898 --> 38:41.026
We've looked over every inch of skin
on her body, House! It's over.

38:49.369 --> 38:51.996
Hey, is that the first time you had sex?

38:54.874 --> 38:57.960
With all the other stuff going on down
there, she might not have realized.

39:12.517 --> 39:14.768
- You sick, miserable...
- What are you doing?

39:14.894 --> 39:16.228
Oh, my God!

39:18.982 --> 39:21.734
See? Told you it'd be
even more dramatic.

39:26.239 --> 39:28.782
Push norepinephrine.
Get her heart back to normal.

39:28.908 --> 39:31.785
She'll be completely cured by tomorrow.

39:32.954 --> 39:35.748
Foreman, let's get her into the ICU.

39:50.263 --> 39:53.682
Inamrinone was a stupid idea

39:53.808 --> 39:56.060
unless you wanted me
to get that girl in the elevator.

39:56.186 --> 39:59.897
- Oh, I wouldn't do that.
- Wouldn't respect you if you did.

40:07.322 --> 40:12.326
Wow, looks like somebody filed
halfway through your cane

40:12.452 --> 40:14.495
while you were sleeping.

40:40.522 --> 40:42.314
Reflexes back to normal.

40:42.440 --> 40:43.982
Heart's looking good, too.

40:44.109 --> 40:46.819
I'll send in the nurse,
we'll get you transferred out of ICU.

40:46.945 --> 40:49.571
You'll be discharged in the morning.

40:49.697 --> 40:51.949
Thank God. I just wanna get home.

40:52.700 --> 40:54.952
And back to school on Monday.

40:56.871 --> 40:58.247
I'm not ready.

40:58.998 --> 41:00.666
You're ready.

41:01.334 --> 41:04.920
- I'm sick, Mom.
- You're not sick.

41:05.046 --> 41:07.714
You're gonna go to class,

41:07.841 --> 41:11.051
and you're gonna see
your friends and your boyfriend.

41:17.892 --> 41:19.852
What's this doohickey?

41:22.188 --> 41:25.315
A brassiere.
You know about those things.

41:25.441 --> 41:27.401
You're a big boy now.

41:27.527 --> 41:29.778
Well, I've never run across
one like that.

41:29.904 --> 41:32.906
It's brand new.
Revolutionary uplift.

41:33.032 --> 41:36.326
- It's explained to you.
- I know. I know.

41:36.452 --> 41:42.040
I have acrophobia,
which gives me vertigo and I get dizzy.

41:42.167 --> 41:43.625
What a moment to find out I had it.

41:43.751 --> 41:45.210
Well, you've got it.

41:45.336 --> 41:47.754
There's no one to blame.
Why quit?

41:47.881 --> 41:50.716
You mean and sit behind a desk?
Chair-borne.

41:50.842 --> 41:54.011
- It's where you belong.
- What about my acrophobia?

41:54.137 --> 41:56.555
I called a divorce lawyer today.

41:58.391 --> 42:00.225
Does that mean you're leaving?

42:01.311 --> 42:02.853
At some point.

42:06.608 --> 42:10.611
You might not want to sit exactly there.
