'God, I'm nervous,
I haven't seen Mark for six months.

00:20.800 --> 00:22.280
'Hope he's not too horrible.

00:22.320 --> 00:24.879
'Maybe he'll have forgotten
I tried to steal his girlfriend.

00:24.920 --> 00:26.000
'I pretty much have.'

00:26.039 --> 00:28.519
'I'll never forget he tried
to steal my girlfriend.

00:28.559 --> 00:31.519
'But I won't mention it tonight,
can't ruin Super Hans' stag.

00:31.559 --> 00:33.280
'I've reached acceptance.

00:33.320 --> 00:37.159
'With the aid of a self-help
CD I loathe, I've reached acceptance.

00:37.200 --> 00:38.960
'Oh, my God, there he is.'

00:39.000 --> 00:42.439
'Here we go, Mr Big,
the ex-provider of my cheddar.'

00:42.479 --> 00:44.960
'Relax, no recriminations
on the stag.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.960
'I haven't had a night out
for months,

00:47.000 --> 00:48.640
'no recriminations on the stag.'

00:48.679 --> 00:52.280
Hello...Jeremy. Mark.

00:52.320 --> 00:55.439
Good to see you.
Likewise, I'm sure. So...

00:55.479 --> 00:57.520
'Going to relax this shit
out with a lean.'

00:57.560 --> 01:01.560
Yeah, so...howz youz?
I'm most content.

01:02.039 --> 01:04.159
Right, that's good
that you're happy.

01:04.200 --> 01:07.400
I mean, obviously not that happy,
since Dobby moved to New York.

01:07.439 --> 01:11.359
'Ugh! I did recriminations
on the stag.' Yeah, right.

01:11.400 --> 01:13.159
'The Elephant Man never forgets.'

01:13.200 --> 01:16.719
Well, this is it. Super Hans' stag.

01:16.760 --> 01:20.760
Hard hats on, time to
descend into the depths of depravity.

01:22.799 --> 01:24.840
Oi-oi, it's Snoopy
and the Red Baron,

01:24.879 --> 01:27.319
come in,
you pair of fucking carb-loaders.

01:27.359 --> 01:30.519
The base juices are all paid for,
lads, so choose your

01:30.560 --> 01:34.120
fucking additions and let's detox
till we've got mega cocks.

01:34.159 --> 01:36.400
'Oh, my God,
he's cleaned up for the wedding.

01:36.439 --> 01:40.439
'Iggy's gone to rehab - Sober Hans!'

01:40.560 --> 01:43.439
'This stag is one load
of PG-rated, Disney-assed,

01:43.479 --> 01:45.560
'Which? magazine-approved,
childproof,

01:45.599 --> 01:47.879
'high-vitamin
fucking bullshit.'

01:52.560 --> 01:54.359
..antioxidants.

01:54.400 --> 01:56.799
Oh, here we go, lads, more juice.

01:56.840 --> 01:59.920
Delicious, Hans, I'm just not sure
how much more juice

01:59.960 --> 02:01.680
I can manage, to be honest.

02:01.719 --> 02:05.719
Yeah, after you've had three or four
really big juices... Whatever.

02:05.840 --> 02:09.000
So listen, I thought we would hang
here for a bit, have a little stroll

02:09.038 --> 02:11.439
down Oxford Street, take in the
funny T-shirts,

02:11.479 --> 02:13.039
hit one of my fave Prets,

02:13.080 --> 02:17.079
more juice, bit of a relax,
then this avo - shopping, relax,

02:17.319 --> 02:19.240
juice, and then Tussauds.

02:19.280 --> 02:22.520
They've got a new waxwork of Zoella
and some other wicked YouTubers.

02:22.560 --> 02:24.120
Sound tasty?

02:30.879 --> 02:33.079
'Oh, pissing pure Innocent smoothie,

02:33.120 --> 02:35.639
'there's no way
we can talk more about juice.'

02:35.680 --> 02:39.079
See, the thing about juice from most
places is you get all the fibre

02:39.120 --> 02:41.840
and most of the vitamins,
but if it's been pasteurised

02:41.879 --> 02:45.159
a fucklot of the micronutrient
content has been neutralised.

02:45.199 --> 02:47.920
Oh, no, I don't think so, love,
we're not...

02:47.960 --> 02:51.120
Did one of you jokers order this?
Sorry, wrong table.

02:51.159 --> 02:53.560
Unless, erm... One little siparoo?

02:53.599 --> 02:55.800
No, mate, no! No.

02:55.840 --> 02:57.360
What, just to wet the whistle?

02:57.400 --> 03:01.039
Exactly, just to wet the whistle.

03:01.080 --> 03:02.759
If it's just to wet the whistle...

03:02.800 --> 03:06.800
'That's right, get that big,
old whistle really nice and wet.'

03:07.080 --> 03:10.639
Mm. That is quite refreshing.

03:14.680 --> 03:16.520
Everyone!

03:24.280 --> 03:28.000
Like, I'm really passionate about my
art, but I'm stuck working here,

03:28.039 --> 03:30.639
and it's like, when is it going to
happen for me, you know?

03:30.680 --> 03:32.639
Probably never. Right.

03:32.680 --> 03:35.479
What are your actual chances
of making a living as an artist?

03:35.520 --> 03:39.280
I don't know, like, not very high?
Exactly. Not very high.

03:39.319 --> 03:42.079
Jez, I want to go full horrible.
Take me to the nasties.

03:42.120 --> 03:44.240
All in good time, Hans.

03:44.280 --> 03:46.120
Look, I'm a life coach,

03:46.159 --> 03:49.280
so when I say sometimes you have to
kill a dream to follow a dream,

03:49.319 --> 03:52.000
that's advice backed
by a professional standards body.

03:52.039 --> 03:55.280
'Mm, I've said "body",
she'll be thinking about my body.'

03:55.319 --> 03:59.319
'Scuse me there, mate. Fuck off!
I heard The Strokes before you.

03:59.439 --> 04:00.919
Ha! It DID degenerate.

04:00.960 --> 04:04.199
I knew it would.

04:04.240 --> 04:07.919
I want Molly. I love Molly!
She's not here, Hans.

04:07.960 --> 04:10.759
All right, you're home now,
let's get you on the futon.

04:10.800 --> 04:13.919
Sleep it off. I fucking hate a futon.

04:13.960 --> 04:16.240
Everyone does,
but they're indestructible,

04:16.279 --> 04:17.600
so we are stuck with them.

04:17.639 --> 04:21.120
You're living here with Super Hans
and his fiancee, the three of you

04:21.160 --> 04:22.639
in their tiny flat?

04:22.680 --> 04:26.680
Yep. Oh, yep. So where do you...?
Come on through.

04:27.160 --> 04:31.079
It's a great space,
extremely versatile.

04:31.120 --> 04:34.319
This is...your room? The humidity is
actually great for my chest.

04:34.360 --> 04:36.879
I mean, it's not number one
Hyde Park Palace,

04:36.920 --> 04:38.800
but it suits me down to the ground.

04:38.840 --> 04:41.159
'This is the most pathetic
sight known to man.'

04:41.199 --> 04:42.920
I think of it as a sunken bed.

04:42.959 --> 04:45.519
Yeah, that's probably a good
way to think of it.

04:45.560 --> 04:47.240
Don't even need to leave the tub.

04:47.279 --> 04:48.959
Drink from the tap,
and when I need to,

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
just push the bag down, bang -
the bog's right there.

04:52.040 --> 04:55.480
Just kneel and piss directly
down the plughole. It's my system.

04:55.519 --> 04:57.240
Ah, OK, that's a good...

04:57.279 --> 05:00.120
system. And you haven't even
seen the kitchen.

05:00.160 --> 05:02.839
I love it. Clever.

05:02.879 --> 05:05.000
You've got a great set-up here.

05:05.040 --> 05:07.360
'Mmm, toilet toast.'
Jez, I need to...

05:07.399 --> 05:11.399
Oh, right, yeah, no problem, wicked.
Will it be a longy or a shorty?

05:11.560 --> 05:15.560
A... No worries, you decide.
Take your time.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.839
That is the one small downside,
but it's cool.

05:18.879 --> 05:21.399
Right, well,
you probably want to turn in.

05:21.439 --> 05:24.439
Once Super Hans has
finished his disgusting business.

05:24.480 --> 05:25.839
I'll see you around.

05:25.879 --> 05:29.879
'There he goes, my other half,
my better half, 'er indoors.'

05:30.160 --> 05:33.199
Mark, we need to talk, there's
something I need to say to you.

05:33.240 --> 05:36.000
'Finally!
Let the apologathon commence.'

05:37.079 --> 05:41.079
No, it's going to be a longy!
But maybe not here.

05:41.639 --> 05:44.480
'"Sorry, Mark. I'm sorry."

05:44.519 --> 05:46.920
'So simple, and yet it feels
like if I say it,

05:46.959 --> 05:48.639
'I might actually die.

05:48.680 --> 05:50.959
'OK, no need for an apology now,
I'm back in.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.480
'We'll just pick up
where we left off.'

05:53.519 --> 05:56.519
Jez, this is Jerry. Jerry, Jez.

05:56.560 --> 05:59.199
Jerry? Jerry's
a colleague from the bank. The bank?

05:59.240 --> 06:01.680
I work at a bank now,
Johnson got me in.

06:01.720 --> 06:03.759
Johnson? Yep!
And he's off the sauce.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.560
Erm, unless you count tomato sauce.

06:05.600 --> 06:09.000
Yes, he certainly likes a lot
of tomato sauce on his chips!

06:11.439 --> 06:14.399
Jerry moved in a few weeks back.
Yeah, I've just split from my ex.

06:14.439 --> 06:18.040
She was a miner from Moldova.
A gold miner!

06:18.079 --> 06:20.600
So me and Mark are the
Rebound Brothers. Boing!

06:20.639 --> 06:21.879
Boing.

06:21.920 --> 06:24.040
'The El Dude Brothers trump
the Rebound Brothers,

06:24.079 --> 06:25.439
'you total fucking arsehole.'

06:25.480 --> 06:29.480
I'm the new improved you.

06:39.720 --> 06:42.920
He's using my mug, Mark.
They're all my mugs, Jez.

06:42.959 --> 06:45.480
Jerry's a William Morris fan,
we both are.

06:45.519 --> 06:48.600
"Have nothing in your room that
you do not believe to be beautiful

06:48.639 --> 06:49.879
"or know to be useful."

06:49.920 --> 06:52.639
'I don't know why,
but I HATE Jerry.'

06:52.680 --> 06:54.680
Hey, that's my duvet!
I don't think so.

06:54.720 --> 06:56.279
So, what was it you wanted to say?

06:56.319 --> 06:58.879
I've got work in the morning so I'd
quite like to get to bed.

06:58.920 --> 07:01.600
'Watch him grovel live,
while I swirl a brandy

07:01.639 --> 07:03.680
'and hold a breadstick
like a big cigar.'

07:03.720 --> 07:05.879
'I'm out, Jerry's in -
apology redundant.'

07:05.920 --> 07:07.800
Pretty sure that IS my duvet.

07:07.839 --> 07:09.480
That's it? That's it.

07:09.519 --> 07:13.519
You don't perhaps wish to play
the classic board game "Sorry!" No.

07:14.120 --> 07:16.279
I'll give you a twatting
at Operation if you like.

07:16.319 --> 07:20.319
Or we could hunt for YouTube clips
of the Ronnie Corbett sitcom "Sorry!"

07:20.839 --> 07:23.480
while we ate some...
'Bit much?'

07:23.519 --> 07:24.720
..sorrel soup.

07:24.759 --> 07:27.439
Look, Mark, I know what you're
getting at, but the fact is,

07:27.480 --> 07:31.160
that day with Dobby I had a...
a medical brain attack.

07:31.199 --> 07:33.240
I've got a note from the doctor,
somewhere.

07:33.279 --> 07:36.959
If I can find the bloody thing!
Right.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.759
You are not to blame for anything?
Well, fine. Goodnight.

07:40.800 --> 07:43.279
I'll see you around, no doubt.

07:43.319 --> 07:47.319
'Fine, I'll go, but before I do,
I'm reclaiming the Falklands.'

07:48.000 --> 07:50.279
What are you doing? Taking my duvet,
if that's cool.

07:50.319 --> 07:52.519
No, it's not cool,
Jerry needs it, it's not yours.

07:52.560 --> 07:55.199
Fuck Jerry, it's mine!
Jeremy, this isn't normal!

07:55.240 --> 07:58.079
It is, it's all totally normal!

07:58.120 --> 08:02.120
'There he goes, duvet cape man off to
his toilet kitchen.'

08:04.040 --> 08:05.439
'Another night in the bath.

08:05.480 --> 08:08.000
'I really don't think you could
call my life a failure,

08:08.040 --> 08:10.680
'look at that, I've got
a sleeping bag AND a duvet.'

08:12.079 --> 08:15.000
'If this was the olden days,
I'd be a billionaire.'

08:15.040 --> 08:18.240
Jez, I'm fucked, Molly found
a wrap of coke in me pocket.

08:18.279 --> 08:20.480
Oh, man, so you're in the shit.
Yeah.

08:20.519 --> 08:23.319
Well, no, I had to
say it was yours, so...

08:23.360 --> 08:27.240
you're in the shit. You take
the hit for me, mate? Please.

08:27.279 --> 08:29.800
She'll break it off
if she finds out I've been coke-ing.

08:29.839 --> 08:33.840
Jeremy? Is it true? The coke?
Yes, yes, it's mine.

08:35.360 --> 08:39.360
I brought some coke to the stag,
even though Hans asked me

08:39.879 --> 08:43.200
not to, and... But he refused
to have any. Yeah.

08:43.240 --> 08:45.799
He was like, "Come on!"
And I was like, "No, no."

08:45.840 --> 08:47.879
Why was it in his pocket?

08:47.919 --> 08:51.039
Because he took it off me. Why? Why?

08:51.080 --> 08:53.600
Because he was trying to...

08:53.639 --> 08:57.639
spike people and drug little kids,
and I was like, "No way, dude."

08:58.759 --> 09:02.759
Jez... Uh, yeah, yeah, I'm a spiker,
it's just one of my things.

09:04.759 --> 09:07.639
Yeah, he was like,
"Let's spike these shitheads",

09:07.679 --> 09:11.679
and I was like, "No way."
I couldn't see that happen. Spiking.

09:12.759 --> 09:15.799
I guess I'm just a terrible,
terrible shithead.

09:15.840 --> 09:18.240
Look, we've put up with a lot with
you staying here...

09:18.279 --> 09:21.159
Yeah. ..but I think
if we want the lifestyle we want...

09:21.200 --> 09:24.159
Yeah, look, sorry, Jez,
but you're a bad influence,

09:24.200 --> 09:26.879
and, eh...I think you need to leave.

09:26.919 --> 09:30.320
Can't I stay one more night?
After everything I've done for you?

09:30.360 --> 09:33.360
Not just in the past,
but like, REALLY RECENTLY.

09:33.399 --> 09:36.840
I'm sorry, Jez, but you broke...
You broke our trust.

09:36.879 --> 09:40.879
You're a liar, and a pervert,
and a scumbag,

09:41.120 --> 09:43.700
and I never want to see you again.

09:45.879 --> 09:47.440
'Finally working at a bank,

09:47.480 --> 09:49.799
'and banks have turned
into phone shops.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.720
'But it is still a bank.'

09:51.759 --> 09:53.440
'I'm the Wolf of Wall Street.

09:53.480 --> 09:56.000
'Look out, Boots! I'm going
to by 100 meal deals

09:56.039 --> 09:58.039
'and eat them off a prossie
in the nude.'

09:58.080 --> 10:00.519
Hey, hey, hey, Marco.
How you going, good buddy?

10:00.559 --> 10:03.039
Yeah, great, actually, old pal.
Oh, really?

10:03.080 --> 10:04.933
I thought you might
be feeling like a guy

10:05.014 --> 10:07.000
who's just walked into
a high-class restaurant

10:07.039 --> 10:10.240
with a sausage dog on the end
of his dick. Er, no.

10:10.279 --> 10:13.279
I got something up all my visual
display unit this morning, Mark.

10:13.320 --> 10:15.792
I thought it was a high-definition
photo of some dog shit.

10:15.871 --> 10:16.919
Then I took a closer look,

10:16.960 --> 10:20.000
and I realised it was actually
your sales record. Oh.

10:20.039 --> 10:22.080
Right. I pulled strings
to get you in, Mark.

10:22.120 --> 10:23.879
If you look like
a sausage dog fucker,

10:23.919 --> 10:26.399
then I look like a sausage
dog fucker. Do you get me?

10:26.440 --> 10:28.679
'Got to get my dick out of the dog.'

10:28.720 --> 10:31.840
Someone didn't get enough tomato
sauce on his bacon butty.

10:31.879 --> 10:35.879
Ha, yeah, he certainly needs
a little more sauce.

10:36.240 --> 10:40.240
'Ugh, just repeating the joke.
I need to elaborate on the conceit!

10:40.639 --> 10:42.600
'But too worried about redundancy.'

10:42.639 --> 10:44.840
Hello, how hard can
I shaft you today?

10:44.879 --> 10:48.840
'Jerry's sales record shits on mine.
I need to sell a loan.

10:48.879 --> 10:52.240
'Fuck, where's a good old-fashioned
gullible idiot when you need one?'

10:52.279 --> 10:56.279
Mark?

10:56.440 --> 10:59.919
I felt a bit bad about the other
night, so I got you a biscuit.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.440
I mean, they call them cookies,

11:01.480 --> 11:03.720
but I know you prefer me
to call it a biscuit.

11:03.759 --> 11:07.759
Uh-huh. The good thing is
that to get, say, ?3,000,

11:08.360 --> 11:10.519
you'd pay just 21% APR.

11:10.559 --> 11:13.039
Is that good?
It's pretty good, yeah.

11:13.080 --> 11:16.919
And, er, you'd only need to repay
2% of the capital a month.

11:16.960 --> 11:19.879
'If you want the loan
to last 184 years.'

11:19.919 --> 11:22.759
Three grand? Free?
It's not quite free...

11:22.799 --> 11:25.399
But I get it without having
to give you anything?

11:25.440 --> 11:28.480
Yes. So basically,
it is free, really.

11:29.720 --> 11:32.960
Yes, you've winkled me out.
It is basically free.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.840
And the interesting thing about you

11:34.879 --> 11:38.000
is that you'd actually qualify
as an F6. That sounds good.

11:38.039 --> 11:40.639
It's a credit rating especially
for people like you.

11:40.679 --> 11:43.639
'The terminally ill and criminals
who might flee to Thailand.'

11:43.679 --> 11:46.559
Ooh, I've got a credit rating!
Yes, you have, Jez.

11:46.600 --> 11:48.080
You have.

11:48.120 --> 11:50.159
And to qualify for this loan,

11:50.200 --> 11:52.600
all you need is a reference
from a landlord

11:52.639 --> 11:55.039
or a former landlord.

11:55.080 --> 11:57.720
'Would you like to play capitalism?'

11:57.759 --> 12:00.039
Great. And now I'm all signed up,

12:00.080 --> 12:03.519
could we have a chat about
living arrangements?

12:03.559 --> 12:06.200
Yeah, I've moved out of Hans'.

12:06.240 --> 12:09.240
So yeah, I'm considering something
really exciting -

12:09.279 --> 12:12.519
a night in one of the Royal Parks.

12:12.559 --> 12:15.240
Unless... 'Homeless Jeremy. No!

12:15.279 --> 12:17.519
'Harden the heart! I'm moving on.'

12:17.559 --> 12:20.480
Look, Jez, you wouldn't want
to live with me and Jerry.

12:20.519 --> 12:23.159
We're stick-in-the-muds
who like nothing better

12:23.200 --> 12:25.840
than watching Civilisation
with Kenneth Clark

12:25.879 --> 12:28.679
whilst eating artichokes
and sea bream.

12:28.720 --> 12:31.600
No, great, good.
I'll be fine in the park

12:31.639 --> 12:33.919
till the loan comes through.
Anyway, thanks.

12:33.960 --> 12:36.559
'There goes the first beat of
the butterfly wing

12:36.600 --> 12:40.600
'that starts the next
financial meltdown.'

12:43.399 --> 12:46.519
6:45. There's a lot of evening,
isn't there?

12:46.559 --> 12:49.200
Without the goggle box.
Maybe we should treat ourselves.

12:49.240 --> 12:53.240
Get back to the William Morris
documentary. Um, yeah.

12:53.799 --> 12:56.559
Brilliant. 'Ugh, more William Morris!

12:56.600 --> 13:00.600
'Wallpaper and worker's rights.
God, this is like the Dark Ages.

13:00.720 --> 13:03.919
'Centuries and centuries with nothing
to look forward to except

13:03.960 --> 13:07.960
'the slim possibility a Viking might
break down the door and rape me.'

13:09.159 --> 13:11.600
'Crush! Crush the candy.

13:11.639 --> 13:15.240
'So relentless, so satisfying
yet unsatisfying.

13:15.279 --> 13:19.279
'Like Cleopatra, Candy Crush makes
hungry where most she satisfies.

13:21.159 --> 13:25.159
'Crushing candy, quoting Shakespeare,
hiding in a toilet in my own home.

13:25.279 --> 13:28.480
'This is the confused high point
of Western civilisation.'

13:28.519 --> 13:29.679
Are you OK there, Mark?

13:29.720 --> 13:33.080
Oh, fine, thanks, Jerry.
Shouldn't be too much longer now.

13:33.120 --> 13:35.159
Take your time, mate.
I've paused it.

13:35.200 --> 13:39.200
'ARRRGH! Thought I'd killed 20
minutes of Morris, but no!'

13:41.399 --> 13:44.279
Oh, hello, Mark.
Got time for a chat?

13:44.320 --> 13:46.519
Er... 'Could just shut the door?'

13:46.559 --> 13:48.840
Maybe you'd better come in
for a minute.

13:48.879 --> 13:50.679
'Has he read the loan small print?

13:50.720 --> 13:53.759
'Yeah, right. He doesn't read
the large print.

13:53.799 --> 13:56.840
'But he might protect me
temporarily from Morris.'

13:56.879 --> 13:59.159
'Look out, Mark. My brain's
got something in it,

13:59.200 --> 14:01.000
'and you don't know what something.'

14:01.039 --> 14:03.399
Quite like to get back to
my reading, so...

14:03.440 --> 14:06.840
Yes, so, Mark, did you know that
every time you play Candy Crush

14:06.879 --> 14:09.440
on your phone you sent out
a Facebook invitation?

14:09.480 --> 14:13.039
'Fucking Facebook! Zuckerberg's
fucked me again, that arsehole.'

14:13.080 --> 14:15.519
I have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

14:15.559 --> 14:17.639
I don't think you know
your settings very well.

14:17.679 --> 14:20.000
You're pumping out invites
every time you play.

14:20.039 --> 14:22.480
Perhaps I was hacked.
That happens a lot. It could.

14:22.519 --> 14:25.559
Mm. It just tends to happen
to people who have just sent

14:25.600 --> 14:28.600
pictures of their cock on Twitter.
They're all hacked.

14:28.639 --> 14:31.320
Well, I can't think of
any other explanation.

14:31.360 --> 14:33.519
Look, the problem for you is

14:33.559 --> 14:36.000
I'm your friend. I know you, Mark.

14:36.039 --> 14:38.399
I know you like to pretend that
you're this stuffed shirt

14:38.440 --> 14:41.799
who reads incredibly boring books
about dead people killing each other

14:41.840 --> 14:44.799
with bayonets and typhoid,
but I know the truth.

14:44.840 --> 14:46.799
I've watched Grand Designs with you.

14:46.840 --> 14:50.559
That smile when some eco-glass
gets delayed on its way

14:50.600 --> 14:53.919
from Antwerp and the nice couple
gets pushed over budget.

14:53.960 --> 14:57.000
That's the real you. 'It wasn't
Antwerp, it was Freiburg.'

14:57.039 --> 15:00.600
You're this pathetic human
who likes Twirls and Downton

15:00.639 --> 15:02.240
and Bond and burgers,

15:02.279 --> 15:04.559
so don't come the big guy with me,

15:04.600 --> 15:06.600
because it won't fucking wash.

15:06.639 --> 15:07.929
Mark, the embroidery is over.

15:08.009 --> 15:10.279
It's back onto the gold
- Rossetti and the seizures.

15:10.320 --> 15:12.320
'I do want Octopussy and a Twirl,

15:12.360 --> 15:14.240
'but I'm not giving him
the satisfaction.'

15:14.279 --> 15:18.279
Shall we? After you. I'm interested.

15:21.919 --> 15:24.919
Well, if you are going to stick around,
you might want to get a book out.

15:24.960 --> 15:26.759
Yeah, well, I haven't got
Mr Nice with me.

15:26.799 --> 15:29.480
You're reading Mr Nice AGAIN?
There's a hell of a lot to it.

15:29.519 --> 15:32.279
And when I read it
I'm usually extremely high,

15:32.320 --> 15:34.399
which makes it better,
but also means

15:34.440 --> 15:36.000
that I've forgotten most of it,

15:36.039 --> 15:38.759
which is actually great, because
then it never gets boring.

15:38.799 --> 15:40.759
'Come on, nerd.
Raise the drawbridge.

15:40.799 --> 15:43.440
'King Jeremy's coming back
to his castle.'

15:43.480 --> 15:44.919
Lovely and warm in here.

15:44.960 --> 15:47.279
'Oh, God, he's going
for the thermostat.'

15:47.320 --> 15:50.759
I take it you're a 23 degree guy,
Terry? Jerry. Whatever.

15:50.799 --> 15:53.399
Yes, I am. Mm. Must be
awkward for Mark.

15:53.440 --> 15:55.200
He's a real 21 degree-er.

15:55.240 --> 15:59.120
'The Aldi Poirot with his CBBC
magnifying glass.'

15:59.159 --> 16:01.000
23 versus 21.

16:01.039 --> 16:04.120
It's like Israel versus Palestine,
isn't it? The endless beef.

16:04.159 --> 16:06.360
There's really no possible
compromise.

16:06.399 --> 16:10.120
Mark and I often settle on 22.
22, yeah.

16:10.159 --> 16:11.799
Good. That's good.

16:11.840 --> 16:14.960
Both one degree uncomfortable.

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
Right, who wants a nice cup
of the Kenco?

16:20.799 --> 16:24.519
Jerry said he doesn't want coffee.
He said he'd make his own later.

16:24.559 --> 16:28.559
He said, like he was joking, that
your coffee tastes like horse piss.

16:29.039 --> 16:32.320
But I don't think he was really
joking. Try a bit harder, Jeremy.

16:32.360 --> 16:34.399
And then he hit me.
He did not hit you.

16:34.440 --> 16:37.399
Look, Mark, you need to face facts.
Jerry's a wanker.

16:37.440 --> 16:41.000
Kick him out and kick me back in.
No. Why not? No reason.

16:41.039 --> 16:42.480
Is this the Dobby thing?

16:42.519 --> 16:45.879
No. But is it? Of course it's the
fucking Dobby thing. I knew it!

16:45.919 --> 16:48.480
You tried to profess your love
to my girlfriend

16:48.519 --> 16:51.639
who I was trying to propose to.
You fucked up my life!

16:51.679 --> 16:53.399
So? What do you want me to do?

16:53.440 --> 16:57.440
I want you to apologise! Fine!

16:58.440 --> 17:02.440
Obviously I think we're both very
sorry about what happened. No dice.

17:03.039 --> 17:05.880
I'm really,
really sorry, Mark.

17:05.920 --> 17:07.640
Say it properly, Jeremy!

17:07.680 --> 17:10.759
I'm sorry.
Nope. All right, fine.

17:10.799 --> 17:13.839
I admit I shouldn't have
come on your picnic.

17:13.880 --> 17:15.440
And?! What?!

17:15.480 --> 17:18.079
Look, I'm sorry, all right? Finally!

17:18.118 --> 17:20.839
And if you like I'll lay
it on with a trowel

17:20.880 --> 17:23.079
and tell you how I like you,

17:23.118 --> 17:25.519
I value you... 'Oh, Jesus,
he's going to say he loves me.'

17:25.559 --> 17:27.480
And even... Apology accepted.

17:27.519 --> 17:30.079
Well, thank you. Come on, Mark!

17:30.119 --> 17:32.880
We're into Kelmscott Manor
and the Icelandic landscape!

17:32.920 --> 17:36.400
Maybe I do sometimes
wonder about Jerry,

17:36.440 --> 17:38.680
but I've made my bed,
so I've just got to...

17:38.720 --> 17:40.400
Well, maybe I can help with that.

17:40.440 --> 17:42.160
'What's he doing?'

17:42.200 --> 17:46.200
Mark, look, if you're really not
into the Willie Morris doc,

17:46.480 --> 17:49.119
why don't we change gear?
The Sopranos?

17:49.160 --> 17:51.599
Ruskin. Oh.

17:51.640 --> 17:54.480
John Ruskin. Art patron, draughtsman,

17:54.519 --> 17:56.599
watercolourist and philanthropist.

17:56.640 --> 18:00.400
Yeah, listen, I'm afraid I have
an announcement to make.

18:00.440 --> 18:03.960
I've discovered that in order
to keep himself interested with

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
all this garbage he pretends to
like, Jerry drugs his head off.

18:09.480 --> 18:12.119
Don't be pathetic. I saw you
put something in your pocket.

18:12.160 --> 18:15.519
I didn't like what I saw.

18:15.559 --> 18:19.119
Coke, Mark. Jerry is a cokehead
who loves to take coke.

18:19.160 --> 18:21.279
No, you put that in there.
I took it out,

18:21.319 --> 18:24.359
which is a very, very
different thing.

18:24.400 --> 18:27.839
No, you put it in earlier.
You put it in at an earlier time.

18:27.880 --> 18:30.920
Oh, what a terrible thing to
accuse me of! Come on, Mark.

18:30.960 --> 18:34.319
Tell him to knack off and we'll get
down to some Ruskin and a-readin'.

18:34.359 --> 18:38.359
The thing is, Jerry, I'm not sure
I could live with a drug head.

18:38.960 --> 18:42.079
This is ridiculous. It's laughable.

18:42.119 --> 18:45.160
Why are you trying to get rid of me,
Mark? You don't believe him.

18:45.200 --> 18:49.160
Maybe I'm not quite as interested in
William Morris as I thought I was

18:49.200 --> 18:51.640
when you first started
to go on about him.

18:51.680 --> 18:55.079
Why didn't you just say?
I can't just say things, Jerry!

18:55.119 --> 18:57.759
What if I don't want to go?
Well, we can't go back now.

18:57.799 --> 18:59.720
The atmosphere is soured.

18:59.759 --> 19:02.240
We have no choice. No, I can
live in a sour atmosphere.

19:02.279 --> 19:04.920
Well, I can't. 'Yes, you bloody can.'
Tough.

19:04.960 --> 19:07.000
I'm going to go to MY bedroom now,

19:07.039 --> 19:11.039
and I will be coming
and going as I please.

19:13.319 --> 19:16.279
What about going Litvinenko?
Kill him?

19:16.319 --> 19:19.039
With polonium? Not full Litvinenko.

19:19.079 --> 19:22.759
Just a little bit of something
debilitating in his pasta each night.

19:22.799 --> 19:26.400
Grind him down, weaken him,
till he's all pathetic

19:26.440 --> 19:29.920
and you can just scoop him up
like a sick whippet

19:29.960 --> 19:31.799
and dump him. Um...

19:31.839 --> 19:33.799
You might quite like tending him

19:33.839 --> 19:36.319
as he grows weaker and weaker.

19:36.359 --> 19:40.359
"Here's your tea, Jerry.
God, you must get better soon."

19:40.440 --> 19:42.319
"Oh, do sit up, Jerry,

19:42.359 --> 19:46.359
"while I spoon you some more of
this slightly silvery porridge."

19:49.559 --> 19:53.319
Should I keep my voice down? No,
he's an irritatingly sound sleeper.

19:53.359 --> 19:55.599
Earplugs and eye mask, the full lot.

19:55.640 --> 19:59.640
Well, we could start by just
moving his stuff out.

19:59.680 --> 20:02.759
No. No, we couldn't.

20:02.799 --> 20:04.720
Could we?

20:05.920 --> 20:08.039
OK, we're nearly there.
Last two.

20:08.079 --> 20:10.119
This doesn't feel good.
It's fine, Mark.

20:10.160 --> 20:12.720
It's like a prank. Oi-oi.

20:12.759 --> 20:14.799
How's the ethnic cleansing going?

20:14.839 --> 20:17.599
Hans? I thought it might be a good
idea to have some backup.

20:17.640 --> 20:20.000
I owe Jez. He took a bullet for me.

20:20.039 --> 20:23.440
You, you're a pure chrome dildo.
Solid.

20:24.799 --> 20:27.200
Everything's out. What now?

20:27.240 --> 20:29.559
We could tie him to
a hot-air balloon.

20:29.599 --> 20:32.240
Then he would drift away
out of the window.

20:32.279 --> 20:34.960
Erm... You like that?
The hot-air balloon?

20:35.000 --> 20:37.920
Or...punch him? Hans?
What you looking at me for?

20:37.960 --> 20:41.599
You punch him. Maybe you could sit
on him, intimidate him, yeah?

20:41.640 --> 20:45.640
Fart on his face. Psychological
warfare. Yeah, grind him down.

20:45.720 --> 20:49.400
Attack his beliefs. Yeah.
That, plus we fart.

20:49.440 --> 20:52.240
What is this, farty Guantanamo?

20:52.279 --> 20:54.119
No, I...

20:54.160 --> 20:58.160
I think we have to wake him up,
just tell him to leave, like men.

20:58.359 --> 21:02.359
Or... He is sort of bagged
for our convenience.

21:03.160 --> 21:06.119
Hm! What? We could just...

21:06.160 --> 21:08.279
bag him up and sling him out.

21:08.319 --> 21:10.440
'I'm definitely going
to agree to this.

21:10.480 --> 21:13.119
'I just need to put up an acceptable
level of objection

21:13.160 --> 21:16.079
'so I can be all reproachful
if it proves to be a disaster,

21:16.119 --> 21:18.119
'which it almost certainly will.'
No!

21:18.160 --> 21:20.039
No way. No.

21:20.079 --> 21:22.279
Well...

21:22.319 --> 21:26.319
OK, but on your heads be it.
Bag him, Hans.

21:28.519 --> 21:30.000
Argh!

21:30.039 --> 21:32.400
Hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey!
I got him. He's bagged.

21:32.440 --> 21:34.440
You fucking... What's going on?!
Sorry, pal.

21:34.480 --> 21:37.599
You are surplus to requirements.
Put him out.

21:37.640 --> 21:39.240
I'm sorry, Jerry.

21:39.279 --> 21:41.079
Argh! Ow!

21:41.119 --> 21:43.400
Jez, I thought you were
going to grab the other end.

21:43.440 --> 21:45.319
That's the normal way.
The normal way?

21:45.359 --> 21:48.000
None of this is normal!
I've got a verbal contract!

21:48.039 --> 21:50.440
He doesn't. You don't, Jerry.
Yes, I do!

21:50.480 --> 21:53.279
Small claims court!
I'm not part of this, Jerry.

21:53.319 --> 21:55.519
Put him in the lift, Hans. The lift?

21:55.559 --> 21:58.079
Fucking hell. You got a wheelbarrow?

21:58.119 --> 21:59.680
Why are you doing this, Mark?

21:59.720 --> 22:02.279
I want to read my Napoleon
correspondence

22:02.319 --> 22:05.880
AND watch Storage Hunters.
Does that make me a bad person?

22:05.920 --> 22:08.319
Don't put me in the lift!
Stop wriggling.

22:08.359 --> 22:10.359
Should I give him a kick?
Don't kick him!

22:10.400 --> 22:12.440
Do not kick me! Jerry, stay still.

22:12.480 --> 22:14.400
This will all be over soon.

22:14.440 --> 22:17.920
I'm being kidnapped!
All good here. It's just a prank.

22:17.960 --> 22:21.759
It's hijinks. We're the Croydon
Bullingdon. It's not a prank!

22:21.799 --> 22:23.160
Shush, Jerry.

22:23.200 --> 22:26.240
I'm calling the police! Shut it or
you're getting waterboarded.

22:26.279 --> 22:29.359
Do not bloody waterboard me!
I warned you.

22:29.400 --> 22:31.680
Waterboard!

22:35.000 --> 22:36.839
This is horrible!

22:36.880 --> 22:39.720
You two, seriously - you need
to take a look at yourselves.

22:39.759 --> 22:42.119
He's right! Offensive behaviour!
In he goes.

22:42.160 --> 22:44.559
This is against the
Geneva Convention!

22:44.599 --> 22:48.599
I'm contacting the
Citizens Advice Bureau!

22:49.160 --> 22:51.559
'I'm back, baby. The bitch is back.'

22:51.599 --> 22:55.599
Bye, Jerry. See you at work tomorrow.
