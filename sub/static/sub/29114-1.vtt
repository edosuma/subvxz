01:35.394 --> 01:41.464
Chubby, I trust all is in place
to execute my most devious plan yet.

01:41.466 --> 01:45.535
- It is, my terrible evil leader.
- Great, uh.

01:45.537 --> 01:48.938
The Zooverse animals
will never know what hit them.

02:00.386 --> 02:02.586
Woo-hoo-hoo!

02:02.588 --> 02:05.821
That's it, carbon-based.
You're getting the hang of it now.

02:05.823 --> 02:09.860
Feel free to open up the warp speed
function once we clear this space junk.

02:09.862 --> 02:15.766
You can feel the Sparkle Express's
full power at your, erm... foot tips.

02:15.768 --> 02:20.837
This is so awesome, B-52.
Beats a day at the office anytime.

02:20.839 --> 02:23.439
What are you doing
in space anyhow, elephant?

02:23.441 --> 02:26.041
I thought you had
an office job to go back to.

02:26.043 --> 02:28.979
I do, but I asked for a two-week
paid vacation on the account of

02:28.981 --> 02:31.581
I saved the universe.
They couldn't say no.

02:31.583 --> 02:34.050
Too bad I got to be back
at the office tomorrow.

02:34.052 --> 02:36.420
I wish this time
in space never ended.

02:36.422 --> 02:39.122
Every day is a new mission.
This is so cool!

02:39.124 --> 02:41.957
Remember when a Hamster Planet
needed a chew stick?

02:41.959 --> 02:43.960
We took care of that pronto.

02:43.962 --> 02:46.462
The giraffes were all tangled up
in one big neck-knot.

02:46.464 --> 02:50.766
- Solved that in a snip.
- I'm having a blast.

02:50.768 --> 02:52.569
Thanks for the free
flying lessons too.

02:52.571 --> 02:54.837
Who said anything about free,
carbon-based?

02:54.839 --> 02:56.873
I expect something
in return for the valuable

02:56.875 --> 02:58.842
professional training
I'm providing you.

02:58.844 --> 03:02.746
Oh, er... well, I mean,
I don't have much.

03:02.748 --> 03:04.848
I live pretty modestly.

03:04.850 --> 03:07.651
In my own dimension,
that is. What do I owe?

03:07.653 --> 03:11.688
Well, I could use a case
of synthetic printer lubricants

03:11.690 --> 03:13.623
from your office,
if you must know.

03:13.625 --> 03:15.524
Printer oil? You want me to,

03:15.526 --> 03:18.829
uh, steal printer oil
from my office?

03:18.831 --> 03:22.731
No. Not steal.
You shall borrow some oil, Nuke.

03:22.733 --> 03:28.004
You can replace what you've borrowed at
later time and they promote you to, uh,

03:28.006 --> 03:33.777
Chief Office Manager or whatever you
space animals aspire to these days.

03:33.779 --> 03:38.014
Uh, um... Okay.
So, I'll get you the oil.

03:38.016 --> 03:40.850
- Do you have a copy machine on board?
- Copy machine?

03:40.852 --> 03:43.687
Don't be silly, elephant.

03:43.689 --> 03:47.123
Whatever would I do with a
copy machine out here in space?

03:47.125 --> 03:50.794
No, carbon-based,
it's for my personal mechanics.

03:50.796 --> 03:55.564
Peps my performance and keeps
my system running like a dream.

03:55.566 --> 03:58.034
Oh, er, well, yeah. Sure.

03:58.036 --> 04:00.202
Oh, I'll get you
the whole case then.

04:00.204 --> 04:02.639
I wouldn't want the best
motherboard in the universe to get,

04:02.641 --> 04:04.707
erm, he-he, rusty.

04:04.709 --> 04:06.510
Excellent.

04:06.512 --> 04:09.913
Say, I can't help but notice
you're still flying the Express.

04:09.915 --> 04:12.782
When are you gonna return Princess
Sparklefeather's personal fleet vessel?

04:12.784 --> 04:16.620
Never. The Princess gave me
the keys to this baby.

04:16.622 --> 04:21.257
It's now the B-52 Express
for all intents and purposes.

04:21.260 --> 04:25.262
Cool bananas. Ha-ha. Ah,
how is the Princess these days?

04:25.264 --> 04:29.633
Aah! Fabulous. Loving her honeymoon
at the Twin Island Planets.

04:29.635 --> 04:35.705
Simply divine. Swimming and playing
fuzzball all the day. The dream.

04:35.707 --> 04:38.608
Fuzzball? Oh, wow.

04:38.610 --> 04:42.578
"teach your big ears how to fuzzball,
molecular form, and watch up ahead.

04:42.580 --> 04:45.681
It appears as though we're about
to encounter a meteor storm.

04:45.683 --> 04:50.654
With the Nebula Two wormhole rather close
on our left, and Nebula Three on our right.

04:50.656 --> 04:53.222
Your navigational field
should be vertical.

04:53.224 --> 04:57.693
Er, what happens if we slip
into one of those wormholes?

04:57.695 --> 05:00.664
It's likely we'll be thrust
into another dimension.

05:00.666 --> 05:04.668
Oh, I see. So, we can just find
a wormhole back then, right?

05:04.670 --> 05:09.138
It's possible. The statistical probability
of discovering a return wormhole,

05:09.140 --> 05:13.109
once a Carbon has successfully
migrated dimensions is exactly

05:13.111 --> 05:20.015
4.324675859 percent out of 100.
So, not terribly likely.

05:20.017 --> 05:21.784
Oh! Erm... Ah...

05:21.786 --> 05:24.621
Maybe you should take over
ship controls for this part.

05:24.623 --> 05:27.923
I think that's a smashing idea,
carbon-based.

05:29.728 --> 05:31.794
Whoa! Watch out!

05:31.796 --> 05:35.967
Hold on tight to your floppy ears,
Carbon, it's about to get rough.

05:37.101 --> 05:39.135
<i>Argh!</i>

05:39.137 --> 05:41.270
<i>I think I'm gonna be sick.</i>

05:41.272 --> 05:44.173
Try to control yourself
for space sake.

05:44.175 --> 05:48.010
You're in the hands of a
tightly calibrated machine here.

05:48.012 --> 05:50.046
Ooh, that was close.

05:50.048 --> 05:53.817
How about two cases of printer oil, B-52?
Ha-ha. You've earned it.

05:53.819 --> 05:58.621
Oh, carbon-based, you know how to
flatter an old machine like me.

05:58.623 --> 06:02.625
I'd cry if I had tear
ducts. Unfortunately, I do not,

06:02.627 --> 06:06.328
but I'm thinking of getting a pair as
soon as I return to my home planet.

06:06.330 --> 06:09.164
I think two tear ducts
is all I need to feel

06:09.166 --> 06:12.969
like a real organically
viable life form.

06:12.971 --> 06:16.972
What do you say, Carbon?
Could you imagine me with tear ducts?

06:16.974 --> 06:20.142
I bet you could never
tell I was a synthetic organism

06:20.144 --> 06:23.046
if I started pouring
buckets of tears right now.

06:23.048 --> 06:28.351
You'll be like, "Oh, that's a real
living thing." You would too, OMG, he-he.

06:28.353 --> 06:31.721
Yes. Sure, he-he. Tear ducts are
all their age these days.

06:35.293 --> 06:41.798
<i>Hello again my Siders. I hope this transmission finds you</i>

06:41.800 --> 06:45.769
<i>oh, so unwell.</i>

06:45.771 --> 06:50.907
Long time no see, Boo Boo.
You sure know when to drop in, don't you?

06:50.909 --> 06:54.010
Oh, it's a gift I've got.

06:54.012 --> 06:56.779
I'm just excellent
at this stuff.

06:56.781 --> 07:00.183
<i>Dropping in,
dropping out, scaring folks,</i>

07:00.185 --> 07:05.224
you know,
evil leader stuff, he-he.

07:07.425 --> 07:11.094
Whoa! Meteor hit! Meteor hit!

07:11.096 --> 07:15.097
Boo Boo, if you'll excuse us, you caught
us at a really bad time right now.

07:15.099 --> 07:18.234
I <i>do</i> mind actually.

07:18.236 --> 07:20.402
I was just calling to tell you...

07:20.404 --> 07:22.272
Over and out, Boo Boo.

07:22.274 --> 07:26.275
- You dumped Boo Boo's call?
- I did, indeed.

07:26.277 --> 07:30.947
- He's gonna be <i>mad!</i>
- Oh, let him.

07:30.949 --> 07:34.349
Letting out some steam will do
that rodent form some good.

07:34.351 --> 07:36.085
What do you think he wanted, B?

07:36.087 --> 07:38.287
I imagine he wants
what he always wants,

07:38.289 --> 07:40.789
chaos, mayhem, and destruction.

07:40.791 --> 07:43.325
It's just a matter how
he's going to go about getting it.

07:43.327 --> 07:46.895
I guess we'll just have to wait and see.
Oh, dear.

07:46.897 --> 07:49.998
I just can't deal with any more
chips and dents on my face

07:50.000 --> 07:54.137
from all the emotional roller-coaster
of dealing with space villains.

07:59.344 --> 08:02.010
I... I don't understand.

08:02.012 --> 08:06.282
I was calling those cheese-brains
to give them my evil gloat speech.

08:06.284 --> 08:10.085
What just happened?
Chubby, check our connections.

08:10.087 --> 08:13.156
If those 3D transmitters
are on the fritz again,

08:13.158 --> 08:17.894
we are taking this ship right back
to Ships-R-us for a full refund.

08:17.896 --> 08:22.765
I've had it with lousy
customer service. I've had it!

08:22.767 --> 08:25.534
We used to be able to
get what we wanted by instilling

08:25.536 --> 08:30.106
fear and dread in every being
we encountered. Not anymore.

08:30.108 --> 08:34.778
This ease-and-lab-garbage
has ruined the universe.

08:34.780 --> 08:37.279
Anyone thinks they can
get away with anything.

08:37.280 --> 08:42.116
Um, it appears as though the Sparkle
Express terminated our connection, Boo Boo.

08:42.119 --> 08:47.156
Excuse me?
They... they hung up on me?

08:47.158 --> 08:54.329
- It appears so, yes.
- Ugh! Feta, feta, feta, feta! They will pay for this.

08:54.331 --> 08:57.866
They've no idea
what's in store for them.

08:57.868 --> 08:59.936
I hope everyone enjoys this.

08:59.938 --> 09:03.338
Let's all join hands
and sing kumbaya together.

09:03.340 --> 09:05.441
A moment of truce
between the Nice Side

09:05.443 --> 09:08.477
and the Mice Side
while they can.

09:08.479 --> 09:13.351
This Zooverse hasn't seen
the last of Boo Boo Squeal.

09:21.026 --> 09:23.959
Phew! That was close.

09:23.961 --> 09:25.327
Indeed.

09:25.329 --> 09:28.198
Well, nice flying B-52.

09:28.200 --> 09:30.933
It is what I'm programmed
to do, carbon-based.

09:30.935 --> 09:33.236
Now that the perils are
behind us, I'll drop you off

09:33.238 --> 09:37.506
back at your planet Zootrini.
And remember you mustn't tell anyone

09:37.508 --> 09:42.111
of our missions. Lest you wish
to see them greatly endangered.

09:42.113 --> 09:44.179
My trunk is sealed, B.

10:06.271 --> 10:08.337
<i>Hey, you're back.</i>

10:08.339 --> 10:10.273
<i>I... I thought you quit.</i>

10:10.275 --> 10:13.275
Huh? Er, oh, hey, Marty.

10:13.277 --> 10:15.245
No, just took some time off.

10:15.247 --> 10:16.578
Trust me, I thought of quitting,

10:16.580 --> 10:19.314
but I guess
I'm too soft in the gut.

10:19.316 --> 10:23.553
<i>Oh, darn! Yeah, there was all the gossip
around here that you had jumped ship.</i>

10:23.555 --> 10:27.155
<i>That you were off fighting
the bad guys, never to return.</i>

10:27.157 --> 10:29.491
Oh. Uh, not quite.

10:29.493 --> 10:32.261
Ha-ha. Well, maybe a little.

10:32.263 --> 10:37.100
<i>Nuke, uh, I want you to know while you
were gone, you became our symbol of freedom</i>

10:37.102 --> 10:40.502
<i>for all the animals, especially
the ones stuck in this office.</i>

10:40.504 --> 10:44.908
<i>I got your picture hanging up in my
cubicle and everything, want to see?</i>

10:44.910 --> 10:47.644
Oh, that's okay. I believe you.
Unfortunately, I'm back

10:47.646 --> 10:50.914
at being just another one
of the office animals.

10:50.916 --> 10:53.649
I don't deserve
a picture on anybody's desk.

10:53.651 --> 10:57.486
<i>Yeah. Well, to me, you do.
Welcome back, Nuke.</i>

10:57.488 --> 11:00.689
Thanks. What's been
going on at the watering hole?

11:00.691 --> 11:05.595
- Eeh... You haven't missed much.
- I didn't think I would.

11:05.597 --> 11:08.698
<i>Hey, the boss dumped
a bunch of your workload on me.</i>

11:08.700 --> 11:10.167
Sorry about that, pal.

11:11.199 --> 11:12.235
<i>Nah, no worries.</i>

11:12.237 --> 11:14.270
<i>You know I have
mad computer skills.</i>

11:14.272 --> 11:15.938
<i>I can cluster compute to a</i>

11:15.940 --> 11:18.173
<i>super computer
performance with my eyes closed.</i>

11:18.175 --> 11:19.608
<i>Ha-ha. Crazy.</i>

11:19.610 --> 11:21.410
<i>But, uh, now that you're back,</i>

11:21.412 --> 11:23.178
<i>mind if I forward it to you?</i>

11:23.180 --> 11:24.313
Sure, go ahead.

11:24.315 --> 11:26.316
<i>Awesome. Thanks, pal.</i>

11:26.318 --> 11:28.116
<i>You're a true hero.</i>

11:30.121 --> 11:32.487
<i>What do you think? Could you
get this done by Tuesday?</i>

11:32.489 --> 11:34.656
- Next Tuesday?
- Uh, nope.

11:34.658 --> 11:37.626
- Tuesday tomorrow.
- Argh.

11:46.204 --> 11:52.741
- Chubby, get Kitty Clank on the monitor, will you?
- Right away, boss.

11:52.743 --> 11:56.611
<i>Ahh. Boo Boo, I've heard much about you.</i>

11:56.613 --> 11:59.314
<i>It's a pleasure to finally
make your acquaintance.</i>

11:59.316 --> 12:02.986
<i>I'm certain we can do some
galactic damage together.</i>

12:02.988 --> 12:06.389
That's the idea,
Kitty Clank. Ah-huh.

12:06.391 --> 12:11.193
From the moment I hatched my plan to
renege on the Nice Side's peace treaty

12:11.195 --> 12:16.598
and plunge the Zooverse
back into war, I thought of you.

12:16.600 --> 12:22.672
<i>Ha-ha-ha. I'm flattered, buffed and
lubricated by your words, Boo Boo Squeal.</i>

12:22.674 --> 12:28.010
And a robot of your reputation
deserves a prominent position

12:28.012 --> 12:34.183
in any galaxy's war, so I'd like
to offer you my right hand.

12:34.185 --> 12:37.452
What? Uh, no, don't be giving
your hand away, Boo Boo.

12:37.454 --> 12:40.289
You need
both your hands or paws.

12:40.291 --> 12:42.592
Uhm... No, they're hands.

12:42.594 --> 12:45.761
They look like teeny tiny
hands with cute little nails

12:45.763 --> 12:48.798
and tiny pink padding.
Ha-ha. They're so cute.

12:48.800 --> 12:51.567
- Chubby.
- Don't give one of them away, Boo Boo.

12:51.569 --> 12:54.703
It would be incredibly
inconvenient without one hand.

12:54.705 --> 12:59.342
You won't be able to rub them together
when you do something evil and, and you...

12:59.344 --> 13:01.309
Will you pipe down, Chubby?

13:01.311 --> 13:03.045
I'm speaking figuratively.

13:03.047 --> 13:07.049
A seat at my right hand,
you moron. A seat.

13:07.051 --> 13:09.785
- Oh.
- Anyway...

13:09.787 --> 13:12.654
as I was saying,
I'd like to offer you

13:12.656 --> 13:15.591
a seat at my right hand,
Kitty Clank.

13:15.593 --> 13:18.126
<i>It's an honor
to be asked, Boo Boo.</i>

13:18.128 --> 13:22.531
<i>I'll join your army because
I believe in your cause, war.</i>

13:22.533 --> 13:26.635
<i>I hate peace as much as you do,
if not more.</i>

13:26.637 --> 13:29.304
<i>Oh, my last evil
escapade failed.</i>

13:29.306 --> 13:33.076
<i>I was turned into a cuddly
little robot kitten.</i>

13:33.078 --> 13:38.213
<i>I tasted peace and cuteness
firsthand, and I was horrified.</i>

13:38.215 --> 13:41.083
- The abomination.
- <i>Indeed.</i>

13:41.085 --> 13:45.121
<i>Do you have any idea how
much sweet talking I endured?</i>

13:45.123 --> 13:48.290
<i>How many fluffy bows
I wore around my neck?</i>

13:48.292 --> 13:51.526
<i>How many balls of yarn
I had to play with?</i>

13:51.528 --> 13:53.829
<i>I'm sick just thinking about it.</i>

13:53.831 --> 13:55.630
Ew.

13:55.632 --> 13:58.101
Sounds like a nightmare.

13:58.103 --> 13:59.769
<i>Total nightmare.</i>

13:59.771 --> 14:02.871
<i>Thankfully,
I was able to escape.</i>

14:02.873 --> 14:05.808
<i>If there's anything
I can do to help bring war</i>

14:05.810 --> 14:09.712
<i>back to the Zooverse,
I'm all in.</i>

14:09.714 --> 14:14.283
Sweet <i>mascarpone!</i> Welcome
to the fold, Kitty Clank.

14:14.285 --> 14:19.121
You will receive your first
wicked instructions shortly.

14:19.123 --> 14:21.323
Over and out.

14:21.325 --> 14:25.561
Chubby, locate the space
crust of Ta-Ta the Third for me.

14:25.563 --> 14:28.698
He usually loiters
around Nebula Two.

14:28.700 --> 14:32.668
Right away, Boo Boo. You're so cute
when you're overcome with revenge.

14:32.670 --> 14:35.303
Eeh, what was that?

14:35.305 --> 14:38.441
I... I mean, oh, you're
terrifying when you're angry.

14:38.443 --> 14:43.279
Ah! That's better. I've been
this way since I was a wee mouse.

14:43.281 --> 14:47.817
My schoolmates
lived in abject terror.

14:47.819 --> 14:51.287
All I needed to say was,
"cheese!"

14:51.289 --> 14:55.423
uh-hee-hee,
and they shuddered in fear.

14:55.425 --> 14:56.692
I'll bet they did.

14:56.694 --> 14:59.828
I'm nothing like
that Kitty Clank though.

14:59.830 --> 15:01.831
Did you get a load of that guy?

15:01.833 --> 15:05.635
Crazy as a mad hatter
in a hailstorm that one.

15:05.637 --> 15:08.571
Totally unhinged I tell you.

15:08.573 --> 15:10.640
- <i>I'm still here.</i>
- What?

15:10.642 --> 15:16.312
Oh, eh, oh... I will be
in touch soon, Kitty Clank.

15:16.314 --> 15:20.419
Uh, until then, carry on the good work.

15:21.185 --> 15:24.587
Chubby, how long
have you worked for me?

15:24.589 --> 15:27.590
Uh, as far back as
I can remember, Boo Boo.

15:27.592 --> 15:33.395
Every day, 12 hours a day
for 7,000 ion years.

15:33.397 --> 15:35.497
Yup. It sounds about right.

15:35.499 --> 15:39.202
And, you know,
it would be nice to think you knew

15:39.204 --> 15:41.736
how to do your job by now,
wouldn't it?

15:41.738 --> 15:44.472
Is that a rhetorical question,
Boo Boo?

15:44.474 --> 15:47.610
No, Chubby.
It's an actual question.

15:47.612 --> 15:49.745
Ugh. Argh.

15:49.747 --> 15:54.750
I don't know how I endure.
I really don't.

15:54.752 --> 15:57.886
Start our ship's coordinates,
Chubby, at once.

15:57.888 --> 15:59.423
Right away, Boo Boo.

16:00.791 --> 16:04.526
I think I'm gonna have to find a
couple of toothpicks soon, Marty.

16:04.528 --> 16:06.996
<i>Toothpicks? Whatever for, Nuke?</i>

16:06.998 --> 16:09.231
<i>You got something
stuck between your tusks?</i>

16:09.233 --> 16:12.235
No, I just need something
to keep my eyelids open.

16:12.237 --> 16:14.870
<i>Have you ever tried chicory root, Nuke?
It's the best.</i>

16:14.872 --> 16:16.905
<i>That thing will wake
you up in a snap.</i>

16:16.907 --> 16:19.674
Nah. Chicory root gives me
the jitters.

16:19.676 --> 16:21.910
<i>Eh, you are a sensitive
package there, Nuke.</i>

16:21.912 --> 16:25.615
- <i>Can't imagine how you saved the universe.</i>
- Sometimes I can't either.

16:29.621 --> 16:32.388
- <i>Wake up, Nuke.</i>
- Ah, uh, What?

16:32.390 --> 16:34.789
<i>What?
I didn't say anything.</i>

16:34.791 --> 16:38.827
- Oh. Uh...
- <i>It's me, Bongo Bananas.</i>

16:38.829 --> 16:41.429
What? What are you doing here?

16:41.431 --> 16:43.899
<i>I work here, buddy, remember?</i>

16:43.901 --> 16:45.834
<i>I think all that
adventuring went to his head.</i>

16:45.836 --> 16:47.803
<i>That poor elephant
has gone and lost it.</i>

16:47.805 --> 16:50.972
- <i>I've come to warn you, Nuke.</i>
- Warn me?

16:50.974 --> 16:55.877
<i>Yes, of a great
disturbance in the Sauce.</i>

16:55.879 --> 16:58.847
- No!
- <i>Hey, uh, are you okay over there?</i>

16:58.849 --> 17:00.850
<i>Maybe you need to take
a little more time off.</i>

17:00.852 --> 17:02.784
<i>It's Boo Boo Squeal.</i>

17:02.786 --> 17:05.588
- Boo Boo?
- <i>Yes, Boo Boo.</i>

17:05.589 --> 17:07.422
<i>He's assembling an army.</i>

17:07.424 --> 17:09.523
<i>He's planning
to break the Zooverse</i>

17:09.526 --> 17:11.593
<i>peace treaty and attack.</i>

17:11.595 --> 17:13.862
So, that's why he called.

17:13.864 --> 17:16.931
<i>What?
Has he contacted you?</i>

17:16.933 --> 17:21.369
Yeah, earlier today, but we sort
of, er, hung up on him.

17:21.372 --> 17:24.306
<i>Dude,
hung up on Boo Boo Squeal?</i>

17:24.308 --> 17:27.976
You know how B-52 is. He's got
a bit of a temper. Ha-ha.

17:27.978 --> 17:30.545
<i>I know, I know,
Nuke, my friend.</i>

17:30.547 --> 17:33.448
<i>Synthetic organisms are
always hamming it up</i>

17:33.450 --> 17:36.986
<i>just to make sure we remember
they have feelings too.</i>

17:36.988 --> 17:40.523
Do they ever. What about
Boo Boo Squeal, Bongo?

17:40.525 --> 17:44.459
<i>I fear Boo Boo is
almost ready, Nuke, dude.</i>

17:44.461 --> 17:48.397
Ready? But, Bongo Bananas,
he doesn't have the Sauce.

17:48.399 --> 17:50.765
- How dangerous can he be?
- <i>Hey, bud,</i>

17:50.767 --> 17:53.869
<i>if you need a banana break,
go ahead. I'll cover for you.</i>

17:53.871 --> 17:57.573
<i>More dangerous than you
realize, Nuke my friend.</i>

17:57.575 --> 18:03.379
<i>He's building an army of some of the
baddest baddies the galaxy's ever known</i>

18:03.381 --> 18:07.082
<i>and he's planning on regaining
the power of the Sauce.</i>

18:07.084 --> 18:09.485
- What can we do?
- <i>Why don't you take</i>

18:09.487 --> 18:12.854
<i>the rest of the day off, Nuke?
I'll punch out for you.</i>

18:12.856 --> 18:17.025
<i>You need to call on your
robot buddy, Bon Jovi, stat.</i>

18:17.027 --> 18:22.797
- You mean B-52?
- <i>B-52, Depeche Mode, who cares, Nuke, dude?</i>

18:22.799 --> 18:24.499
<i>He has a space vehicle.</i>

18:24.501 --> 18:26.768
<i>You need to get to it
right away.</i>

18:26.770 --> 18:31.140
- But he just dropped me off.
- <i>Want me to call a space cab?</i>

18:31.142 --> 18:35.678
<i>We need you out there,
Nuke, saving the Zooverse.</i>

18:35.680 --> 18:40.082
<i>Get on the Sparkle Express and on that
mission right away my elephant friend.</i>

18:40.084 --> 18:43.151
- Should I go now?
- <i>Yes.</i>

18:43.153 --> 18:44.820
<i>Yes.</i>

18:44.822 --> 18:48.056
<i>Tiptoes, I can hear you
clear down the hall.</i>

18:48.058 --> 18:51.060
<i>Did you come back
to work or to socialize?</i>

18:51.062 --> 18:54.429
Oh, sorry, boss.
Eh. Working away here.

18:54.431 --> 18:57.533
Typedy type, type, type, type,
titype, type, titype.

18:57.535 --> 19:01.570
It's great to be back with you, guys.
It really is. Oh, how I missed it.

19:01.572 --> 19:04.774
<i>There's no time
for watering hole chat, Nuke.</i>

19:04.776 --> 19:08.511
<i>Boo Boo Squeal must be stopped.
The Zooverse depends on it.</i>

19:08.513 --> 19:12.814
- But what can I do?
- <i>Are you asking for more work, Tiptoes?</i>

19:12.816 --> 19:16.685
<i>You want the Zooverse to
survive, don't you my friend, Nuke?</i>

19:16.687 --> 19:21.791
- Well, yes.
- Well, all you had to do was ask, Tiptoes.

19:21.793 --> 19:24.025
<i>I'm sending files
to your desk now.</i>

19:24.027 --> 19:26.528
<i>I need them completed
by day's end.</i>

19:26.530 --> 19:30.099
<i>Nuke, you got to cool down.
You're gonna overwork yourself.</i>

19:30.101 --> 19:32.601
<i>You don't want
Boo Boo to reduce this Zooverse</i>

19:32.603 --> 19:35.571
<i>to rubble, do you,
my elephant friend?</i>

19:35.573 --> 19:39.007
- No.
- <i>Excuse me?</i>

19:39.009 --> 19:44.612
<i>Nuke, it's now or never.
The Nice Side needs you.</i>

19:48.151 --> 19:52.086
- What do I do?
- <i>Are you paying attention, Tiptoes?</i>

19:52.088 --> 19:54.957
<i>Complete the files and send them
to me when you're done.</i>

19:54.959 --> 19:57.059
<i>Do I speak Zirconian?</i>

19:57.061 --> 19:59.829
<i>Just hit enter.</i>

19:59.831 --> 20:00.996
<i>Good luck,</i>

20:00.998 --> 20:05.868
<i>Nuke</i>

20:05.870 --> 20:08.774
Bongo, Bongo
are you still there?

20:09.841 --> 20:12.140
B-52, long time no see.

20:12.142 --> 20:18.013
Exactly one, one trillionth of a plutonium
ion by my calculations, carbon-based.

20:18.015 --> 20:19.982
In other words,
not very long at all.

20:19.984 --> 20:21.984
Ha! I never thought
I'd be so happy to see

20:21.986 --> 20:23.986
a robot who doesn't
understand humor.

20:23.988 --> 20:28.122
More like a robot that has no time
for anything but factual information.

20:28.124 --> 20:32.894
Humor is for elephants who
perform circus tricks for peanuts.

20:32.896 --> 20:35.497
Hm-mm. Speaking of, you got any?

20:35.499 --> 20:37.499
- I haven't had lunch yet.
- Negative.

20:37.501 --> 20:42.036
The Sparkle Express has no need
for organic food supplies.

20:42.038 --> 20:44.974
Even if the co-pilot
is carbon-based?

20:44.976 --> 20:48.677
Especially if
the co-pilot is carbon-based.

20:48.679 --> 20:52.046
I've observed you elephants eating.
Are you aware of what can happen

20:52.048 --> 20:55.284
if peanut shells jam
the master controls?

20:55.286 --> 20:58.653
Not to mention the gas.
Oh, the gas.

20:58.655 --> 21:00.788
It's, it's just, just horrible.

21:00.790 --> 21:04.226
Uh, well, uh, us elephants
are foragers, you know?

21:04.228 --> 21:07.563
Lots of digestion taking place
in the lower intestines.

21:07.565 --> 21:10.533
Flatulence could be a side
effect of a greasy diet.

21:10.535 --> 21:14.769
Er, uh, avocados, for example,
really do a number on my...

21:14.771 --> 21:19.641
Carbon, last thing I intend to
hear is about your gas issues.

21:19.643 --> 21:23.111
Take some antacid
or something and put it to rest.

21:23.113 --> 21:27.115
The B-52 Express
is no place for flatulence.

21:27.117 --> 21:29.251
Now, what are you doing
back there, prey?

21:29.253 --> 21:31.920
Boo Boo Squeal
is planning to violate our truce

21:31.922 --> 21:33.988
and re-start war
with the Zooverse.

21:33.990 --> 21:37.793
Well, congratulations,
Captain Obvious.

21:37.795 --> 21:41.697
- Well... What? You know about it?
- Of course I know about it.

21:41.699 --> 21:45.700
You didn't trust Boo Boo Squeal to
actually honor that peace treaty, did you?

21:45.702 --> 21:50.839
Well, uh, oh...
I mean, he, he said he'd...

21:50.841 --> 21:54.075
Villains always say,
carbon-based.

21:54.077 --> 21:56.711
It was only a matter
of time before he reneged.

21:56.713 --> 22:00.181
I'm just pleasantly surprised
peace lasted as long as it did.

22:00.183 --> 22:03.986
We should contact Boo Boo Squeal and
see what he wanted to tell us earlier.

22:03.988 --> 22:06.021
Shouldn't have hung up on him,
you know?

22:06.023 --> 22:09.592
Rats can hold a grudge,
especially evil ones.

22:09.594 --> 22:12.093
Hopefully it won't cause
the end of the Zooverse.

22:12.095 --> 22:15.267
Ha! He'll get over it.
Let's get him on the telly.

22:25.642 --> 22:27.909
Boo Boo,
the Sparkle Express is calling.

22:27.911 --> 22:30.144
Let them.

22:30.146 --> 22:33.047
If they think
they can hang up on Boo Boo

22:33.049 --> 22:36.685
and then call back,
they're sorely mistaken.

22:36.687 --> 22:40.022
Connect us to Ta-Ta
the Third instead.

22:40.024 --> 22:42.957
At least he has some manners.

22:42.959 --> 22:45.159
Right away, Boo Boo.

22:45.161 --> 22:47.696
Greetings, Ta-Ta.

22:47.698 --> 22:51.136
I see you are ready
to join forces with me again.

22:51.901 --> 22:53.936
We've done great evil things

22:53.938 --> 22:56.772
in the past and we shall
again in the future.

22:56.774 --> 22:59.073
What you say?

22:59.075 --> 23:03.044
<i>I say I'm ready to join forces
with the evilest space monster</i>

23:03.046 --> 23:05.080
<i>the Universe has ever known.</i>

23:05.082 --> 23:11.719
Hm, I think I prefer
powerfullest over evilest.

23:11.721 --> 23:13.255
What do you think, Chubby?

23:13.257 --> 23:17.191
Hm, powerfullest encompasses
more traits, I think.

23:17.193 --> 23:21.196
Like, uh, evilest is just
the evilest and then that's it.

23:21.198 --> 23:24.800
Right. Evilest is just bad,

23:24.802 --> 23:28.937
whereas powerfullest is
a limitless characteristic.

23:28.939 --> 23:33.441
I'd go with powerfullest if I had to pick.
It sounds more epic.

23:33.443 --> 23:36.078
Me too.

23:36.080 --> 23:38.680
Powerfullest it is.

23:38.682 --> 23:40.983
<i>Uh, if I could
chime in here as someone</i>

23:40.985 --> 23:44.218
<i>who's also been called both
powerfullest and evilest,</i>

23:44.220 --> 23:48.690
<i>I find that the evilest reputation
has a certain ring to it</i>

23:48.692 --> 23:51.325
<i>that powerfullest
just doesn't have.</i>

23:51.327 --> 23:54.929
Oh, really?
What do you like about it?

23:54.931 --> 23:57.365
Well, if you're the powerfullest
it's like, you know,

23:57.367 --> 24:01.803
<i>"Eh, maybe he's a nice guy who happens</i>
to be the most powerfullest too."

24:01.805 --> 24:04.372
<i>Whereas if you're
known as evilest</i>

24:04.374 --> 24:07.376
<i>they tend to stay
way out of your way a bit more.</i>

24:07.378 --> 24:12.346
<i>It does a lot of the work for you.
There's no mistaking evilest, you know?</i>

24:12.348 --> 24:13.748
I see.

24:13.750 --> 24:19.021
So, it's easier
to pillage and conquer.

24:19.023 --> 24:22.123
- <i>Pretty much.</i>
- Great. Oh. Ah.

24:22.125 --> 24:25.326
In that case,
the rumors are true,

24:25.328 --> 24:29.997
I am definitely the evilest
mouse in the Zooverse,

24:29.999 --> 24:34.002
- and I come to you with a proposition.
- <i>Oh, yeah?</i>

24:34.004 --> 24:40.175
Ta-Ta, how would you like
to join a coalition of evil?

24:40.177 --> 24:44.446
The likes of which the Zooverse
has never seen.

24:44.448 --> 24:48.015
<i>You had me at evil.
Ha-ha. Yeah, tell me more.</i>

24:48.017 --> 24:51.186
This era of peace
has gone on long enough.

24:51.188 --> 24:54.288
The Zooverse is full
of fantastic villains

24:54.290 --> 24:58.927
and we've all been diminished
by playing, uh, nicey-nice.

24:58.929 --> 25:02.430
<i>I heard that. Did you know
that Ranger The Forked Tongue</i>

25:02.432 --> 25:06.435
<i>reads children stories at the
library on Planet Bubbles?</i>

25:06.437 --> 25:09.071
Argh! No!

25:09.073 --> 25:11.372
<i>It's true. I saw him meself.</i>

25:11.374 --> 25:15.910
What was Ta-Ta the Third doing
at a library on Bubbles?

25:15.912 --> 25:19.113
<i>I work a janitorial shift
in there on Sundays.</i>

25:19.115 --> 25:22.817
Ew. Ah, alright.
That proves my point.

25:22.819 --> 25:27.221
I say, "No more."
We want to break the truce.

25:27.223 --> 25:32.326
Attack the Nice Side and
reclaim the Sauce for ourselves.

25:32.328 --> 25:35.496
- Yeah.
- <i>Sounds good. I'm in.</i>

25:35.498 --> 25:37.332
Excellent.

25:38.235 --> 25:39.868
I'll also have you know,

25:39.870 --> 25:43.805
I'm looking for a deputy
commander in this outfit,

25:43.807 --> 25:47.543
and I think you'd
fit the bill nicely.

25:47.545 --> 25:50.478
- <i>Does it pay?</i>
- How's all the Sauce

25:50.480 --> 25:54.082
you can pour on your
spaghetti sound?

25:54.084 --> 25:55.149
<i>Eh, deal!</i>

25:55.151 --> 25:57.518
Wonderful.

25:57.520 --> 26:01.290
I have a couple more stops
to make to fill out our team.

26:01.292 --> 26:05.026
If everything comes together,
we'll attack at once.

26:05.028 --> 26:08.296
We'll be in touch,
Ta-Ta.

26:08.298 --> 26:12.834
Eh, eh, Chubby, find me the
ship of Coot-Coot of Planet Warzack.

26:12.836 --> 26:16.237
- I must speak with him next.
- Aye, aye, captain.

26:16.239 --> 26:19.975
And no pirate voice, Chubby.
It's just weird.

26:19.977 --> 26:22.244
Oh, right. Right away, Boo Boo.

26:22.246 --> 26:27.181
Speaking of weird,
did you get a load of Ta-Ta?

26:27.183 --> 26:28.883
Did he put on weight or what?

26:28.885 --> 26:32.920
Ha-ha. More like
Fat-Fat the Third.

26:32.922 --> 26:37.458
<i>You forgot
to sign off there, Boo Boo.</i>

26:37.460 --> 26:39.628
Oh, oh, yes, of course.

26:39.630 --> 26:44.932
Over and out and talk soon, Fa...
I mean, Fat Fa... I mean, Ta-Ta.

26:44.934 --> 26:48.136
Chubby!

26:48.138 --> 26:50.175
Sorry.

26:58.015 --> 27:02.551
Boo Boo? Come in, Boo Boo. It's Nuke
with the Sparkle Express. Come in.

27:02.553 --> 27:06.388
Argh. He's not answering.
I told you he'd be mad.

27:06.390 --> 27:08.556
Mice. So sensitive.

27:08.558 --> 27:11.893
B-52, I feel like we're
in over our heads here.

27:11.895 --> 27:15.162
Bongo Bananas came to me at work
and told me of Boo Boo's plans.

27:15.164 --> 27:19.133
Sounds like a zoo war is about
to break again. What can we do?

27:19.135 --> 27:22.470
There's only one thing to do
at a time like this, carbon.

27:22.472 --> 27:28.142
- What is it? Tell me.
- Oil your joints and get your motherboard tuned.

27:28.144 --> 27:32.179
Oil my... oh, come on.
I'm an elephant.

27:32.181 --> 27:35.550
You can oil your joints and
get tuned, but what can I do?

27:35.552 --> 27:38.586
I suppose you can try
balancing on your front legs,

27:38.588 --> 27:42.690
like they do in the circus.
Some call it yoga I believe.

27:42.692 --> 27:44.525
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

27:44.527 --> 27:48.296
Say, why don't we call
Princess Sparklefeather?

27:48.298 --> 27:52.534
She's the leader of the Nice Side.
Surely she'll know how to handle this.

27:52.536 --> 27:57.238
I told you. She's honeymooning
at the Twin Island Planets

27:57.240 --> 27:59.541
for the next fractal ion.
And then there's

27:59.543 --> 28:02.410
no telecommunication
reception I'm afraid.

28:02.412 --> 28:05.447
Goodness knows
she's earned the rest.

28:05.449 --> 28:08.149
Well, don't you think
she'd want to know

28:08.151 --> 28:11.320
that Boo Boo Squeal is amassing an
army to violate the peace treaty

28:11.322 --> 28:14.055
and get his little mouse
hands on the Sauce again?

28:14.057 --> 28:16.490
Ooh, that would probably
be of interest, yes.

28:16.492 --> 28:19.494
But, as I said,
she's unreachable at the moment.

28:19.496 --> 28:22.596
Then why don't we go get her?

28:22.598 --> 28:26.501
And interrupt her honeymoon?
Heavens, no.

28:26.503 --> 28:29.071
You don't make sense sometimes,
you know that?

28:29.073 --> 28:31.005
<i>I</i> don't make sense?

28:31.007 --> 28:32.573
I'm a robot.

28:32.575 --> 28:35.076
All I do is make sense.

28:35.078 --> 28:36.745
I'm built to be factual.

28:36.747 --> 28:40.415
And yet you're making
an emotional decision

28:40.417 --> 28:43.084
to not interrupt
the Princess's honeymoon.

28:43.086 --> 28:46.621
Hm, I suppose you have
a point there, carbon-based.

28:46.623 --> 28:51.293
I have to schedule a tune up and get
those tear ducts implants while I'm at it.

28:51.295 --> 28:53.461
Aah. We're doomed.

28:57.668 --> 28:59.668
I've located
Coot-Coot's ship, Boo Boo.

28:59.670 --> 29:04.038
He's right up ahead, circling
Nebula 2, just like you said.

29:04.040 --> 29:08.176
Well, what are you waiting for?
Patch me through.

29:08.178 --> 29:11.246
Hey. Do you... do you think I
should go by Chub-Chub instead?

29:11.248 --> 29:15.516
Why would you do that?
You've always been Chubby.

29:15.518 --> 29:19.487
Well, he-he, all you guys
have two names, all but me.

29:19.489 --> 29:22.623
<i>And,</i> uh...
that should tell you something.

29:22.625 --> 29:26.363
- Connect us to Coot-Coot.
- Oh, uh, okay.

29:28.231 --> 29:31.533
<i>Who goes there?</i>

29:31.535 --> 29:36.438
Greetings, Coot-Coot.
It's been a while.

29:36.440 --> 29:40.475
Ho-ho. Fancy meeting you here,
Boo Boo Squeal.

29:40.477 --> 29:45.413
<i>I thought I'd seen the last of you
after the battle of the Planet Bubbles.</i>

29:45.415 --> 29:50.451
Alas, that was only the beginning
of the Mice side takeover.

29:50.453 --> 29:55.323
We've since grown strong
with the Sauce, Coot-Coot.

29:55.325 --> 29:58.159
<i>You possess the Sauce?</i>

29:58.161 --> 30:04.533
Well, no, not currently, it's been
stripped from me by the Nice Side,

30:04.535 --> 30:08.736
but I'm working
on regaining my powers.

30:08.738 --> 30:11.739
- <i>Oh.</i>
- Working hard?

30:11.741 --> 30:16.078
- Very hard.
- Yeah, almost there.

30:16.080 --> 30:19.547
Which brings me
to the point of my visit.

30:19.549 --> 30:24.718
Ha-ha. I, I'm assembling
a team of Galactic villains

30:24.720 --> 30:29.357
unlike anything
the Zooverse has ever seen.

30:29.359 --> 30:35.764
Separately we are fearsome,
but together we're unstoppable.

30:35.766 --> 30:39.633
<i>And what are you gonna
do with this team?</i>

30:39.635 --> 30:46.640
We are going to curdle cheese and
tell funny stories about past wars.

30:46.642 --> 30:48.877
What do you think?

30:48.879 --> 30:55.417
We're going to regain the Sauce,
violate that lousy peace treaty

30:55.419 --> 30:59.420
and propel the Zooverse
back into war.

31:01.391 --> 31:07.228
- Are you with us?
- <i>Oh! That sounds awesome. I'm in.</i>

31:07.230 --> 31:10.131
Marvelous! Aah.

31:10.133 --> 31:15.836
I have one more stop to make,
then I'll be in touch with directives,

31:15.838 --> 31:21.409
the gist of which is
to destroy the Nice Side.

31:21.411 --> 31:23.344
<i>I can't wait.</i>

31:23.346 --> 31:25.546
That's the attitude.

31:25.548 --> 31:29.417
Er, Chubby?
End this transmission.

31:29.419 --> 31:33.321
There, that wasn't so difficult, was it?

31:33.323 --> 31:35.256
Uuh, n... no?

31:35.258 --> 31:39.294
How about that goofy creature,
Coot-Coot, huh? Ha-ha.

31:39.296 --> 31:44.299
Brains the size of a Swiss
cheese hole.

31:44.301 --> 31:46.501
<i>Boo Boo, I'm still here.</i>

31:46.503 --> 31:48.335
- Eh! You what?
- <i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

31:48.337 --> 31:53.175
<i>You turned off visual,
but the audio is still live.</i>

31:53.177 --> 31:56.311
Chubby!

32:00.450 --> 32:05.853
B-52, I'd just feel a lot better
if we had somebody else on board.

32:05.855 --> 32:07.855
You know, to get our backs
in case we're in trouble.

32:07.857 --> 32:11.325
We need our very own
Nice Side Hero team.

32:11.327 --> 32:14.295
Excuse me, what would
they do to our backs?

32:14.297 --> 32:16.531
Never mind, it's just
a figure of speech.

32:16.533 --> 32:21.268
Ah, you carbons are known for your
tenuous grasp on your own language.

32:21.270 --> 32:22.836
Hey, I have an idea.

32:22.838 --> 32:26.207
My buddy who works with me
would never let us down.

32:26.209 --> 32:28.342
He's a computer whiz.
I'm going to call him.

32:28.344 --> 32:33.314
Oh, dear. Kingdoms have fallen
on the backs of buddies.

32:34.250 --> 32:35.483
Marty, hey there.

32:35.485 --> 32:37.686
<i>Hey, big guy. How's it going?</i>

32:37.688 --> 32:39.588
Uh, in a bit
of a situation here.

32:39.590 --> 32:42.591
<i>You disappeared again.
You back being a space hero?</i>

32:42.593 --> 32:47.996
Uh, trying to be. Say, did you...
did the boss dump all my work on you again?

32:47.998 --> 32:50.732
<i>Ha. He buried me up
to my eyeballs.</i>

32:50.734 --> 32:54.302
<i>Oh, that's okay though.
I can handle it. I'm mostly eyeballs.</i>

32:54.304 --> 32:57.639
Don't worry. I'll take it all off
your hands when I come back, Marty.

32:57.641 --> 32:59.940
<i>Oh! Er, they didn't call you?</i>

32:59.942 --> 33:04.946
- No. About what?
- <i>Er... The boss, uh, terminated you, Nuke.</i>

33:04.948 --> 33:09.251
<i>They're letting you go. They don't want
a space hero who keeps taking time off.</i>

33:09.253 --> 33:11.285
<i>Space heroes are cool
and everything,</i>

33:11.287 --> 33:13.021
<i>but don't get their work done,
you know?</i>

33:13.023 --> 33:15.790
I hope this space hero thing
works out for you, carbon,

33:15.792 --> 33:20.027
or you'll have to go to the Space
Unemployment office to get your peanuts.

33:20.029 --> 33:24.399
Oh, boy. I hope so too.
Say, Marty, I need a favor.

33:24.401 --> 33:28.370
<i>No need to ask, big guy. You can
put me down as a reference anytime.</i>

33:28.372 --> 33:32.040
- Thanks, Marty, but that's not what I'm talking about.
- <i>It's not?</i>

33:32.042 --> 33:35.509
No, I'm here with my pal B-52
of the Nice Side robotic fleet.

33:35.511 --> 33:39.913
<i>Oh. Ah! Well, excuse me.
Moving up in the Zooverse already, I see.</i>

33:39.915 --> 33:43.685
Uh, yeah, space hero stuff.
You know how it is.

33:43.687 --> 33:45.954
<i>Yeah, argh. Wish I did.</i>

33:45.956 --> 33:48.790
Marty, the Mice Side
is at it again.

33:48.792 --> 33:52.560
They are planning to break the Zooverse
truce and start an all-out war.

33:52.562 --> 33:53.928
Oh. Get out!

33:53.930 --> 33:57.064
I wish I could,
but we have to fight.

33:57.066 --> 34:00.334
- There's no time to spare.
- <i>What's all this have to do with me?</i>

34:00.336 --> 34:03.071
He's about to ask you to agree
to perilous activities

34:03.073 --> 34:06.640
far beyond your skill
or understanding, carbon-based.

34:06.642 --> 34:08.475
Ah, okay. Oh.

34:08.476 --> 34:13.547
Uh, kinda. Marty,
the Nice Side currently has no leader.

34:13.549 --> 34:16.451
Princess Sparklefeather is on her
honeymoon and can't be reached.

34:16.453 --> 34:20.955
- I know this is inconvenient, but...
- That's putting it mildly.

34:20.956 --> 34:23.725
But would you join us to try and
put a stop to this craziness?

34:23.726 --> 34:26.895
- <i>It's going to take time from work, isn't it?</i>
- Probably.

34:26.897 --> 34:29.730
<i>Uh, maybe I should just
call in sick, then.</i>

34:29.732 --> 34:33.835
- Might not be a bad idea.
- <i>Okay, I'm in.</i>

34:33.837 --> 34:36.770
Yeah? Thanks, Marty!
I knew we could count on you.

34:36.772 --> 34:41.609
<i>Hey, since it is dangerous and all,
how about we pick a new name for me?</i>

34:41.610 --> 34:43.377
A new name? What do you mean?

34:43.379 --> 34:45.980
<i>Well, Marty doesn't
really have a ring to it,</i>

34:45.982 --> 34:48.750
<i>you know? How about Zortec?</i>

34:48.752 --> 34:51.618
Zortec? Hmm... I don't know.

34:51.620 --> 34:53.754
<i>Or Eyeballs McSane?</i>

34:53.755 --> 34:56.790
Uh, I'm kind of used
to calling you Marty.

34:56.792 --> 35:00.929
- I don't know if I can stop now. It might take some practice.
- <i>Slim Green Star?</i>

35:00.931 --> 35:04.966
- Ooh! That's very heroic.
- <i>You like it?</i>

35:04.968 --> 35:06.667
Indeed.

35:06.669 --> 35:08.737
Why don't we
think about it, Marty?

35:08.739 --> 35:12.473
- <i>Slim, hey, try it out.</i>
- Okay, Slim.

35:12.475 --> 35:16.044
<i>Nice. Ha-ha. Slim Green Star
reporting for duty.</i>

35:16.046 --> 35:18.379
- <i>Where do we start?</i>
- Right at the top.

35:18.381 --> 35:20.415
I need you to use your
supercomputer skills

35:20.417 --> 35:23.551
to intercept the leader of the Mice
Side, Boo Boo Squeal.

35:23.553 --> 35:25.152
We need to know what he's up to.

35:25.154 --> 35:29.089
Woah. I'm on it.

35:35.098 --> 35:38.533
<i>Oh, it's you.</i>

35:38.535 --> 35:41.136
<i>I'm still waiting
on those three gnats</i>

35:41.138 --> 35:44.138
<i>you promised me
for the last mission.</i>

35:44.140 --> 35:47.841
They are coming, Chewflies,
they're coming.

35:47.843 --> 35:50.411
<i>I'd like to know when.</i>

35:50.413 --> 35:55.016
Soon. I got my bookkeeper
on it as we speak.

35:55.018 --> 36:00.020
In the meantime,
I have a proposition for you.

36:00.022 --> 36:04.591
<i>I always seem to get
the soggy end of the lily pad</i>

36:04.593 --> 36:07.661
<i>with your propositions, Boo Boo.</i>

36:07.663 --> 36:10.431
Well, not this time.

36:10.433 --> 36:14.835
I want you to join us in
violating that ridiculous

36:14.837 --> 36:19.873
truce and declaring a new war
on the Zooverse.

36:19.875 --> 36:23.210
<i>Will I finally get my gnats?</i>

36:23.212 --> 36:29.716
You can have all the gnats
you want Chewflies, eh?

36:29.718 --> 36:31.819
Endless gnats.

36:31.821 --> 36:34.188
<i>Endless gnats? Ooh-hoo.</i>

36:34.190 --> 36:36.857
<i>You speak of dreams, Boo Boo.</i>

36:36.859 --> 36:39.726
<i>Ha-ha. Okay, I'm in.</i>

36:39.728 --> 36:44.531
Splendid, and now
with my fearsome new army

36:44.533 --> 36:50.705
by my side, ha-ha, Chewflies,
Coot-Coot, Ta-Ta and Kitty Clank,

36:50.707 --> 36:55.042
the Mice Side will rise again

36:55.044 --> 36:59.246
and the Zooverses
won't know what hit them. Ah?

36:59.248 --> 37:04.986
Chubby, get me coordinates
for the Sparkle Express. Ha-ha.

37:04.988 --> 37:08.922
It's time
to settle an old score.

37:14.029 --> 37:16.998
I feel a lot better
with Marty on our side, B-52.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.866
He may have never
fought a space battle,

37:18.868 --> 37:20.601
but there's strength in numbers.

37:20.603 --> 37:22.504
You mean Slim Green Star?

37:22.506 --> 37:24.272
You know, carbon-based,
sometimes the power

37:24.274 --> 37:26.940
of the mind
is greater than you think.

37:26.942 --> 37:29.176
- What do you mean?
- I mean, sometimes

37:29.178 --> 37:31.578
all it takes
for an ordinary carbon to rise

37:31.580 --> 37:35.116
to extraordinary achievements
is the belief in oneself.

37:35.118 --> 37:41.522
If Marty doesn't inspire one to be
all they can be, perhaps Slim does.

37:41.524 --> 37:44.058
And therein lies a hero.

37:44.060 --> 37:47.562
Wow, I, I never thought
of it like that.

37:47.564 --> 37:51.199
Well, your brain synapses
are extremely limited.

37:51.201 --> 37:55.536
Huh? Oh, hey, I have another
friend I want you to meet.

37:55.538 --> 37:58.772
We worked the circus
together on planet Nordoozy.

37:58.774 --> 38:00.775
You were in a circus?

38:00.777 --> 38:04.812
Yeah, that was before my cubicle
job crushed my showbiz dreams.

38:04.814 --> 38:07.080
- That's where I met Rudy.
- Oh, fine.

38:07.082 --> 38:10.951
Let's meet this circus act,
alright? Can't wait.

38:10.953 --> 38:13.087
Shh. I'm gonna call him.

38:13.089 --> 38:15.556
I bet he'd love to help us.

38:15.558 --> 38:17.158
<i>Check's in the mail.</i>

38:17.160 --> 38:19.726
Rudy, it's me, Nuke Tiptoes.

38:19.728 --> 38:22.163
<i>Nuke? I didn't recognize.</i>

38:22.165 --> 38:24.031
<i>You've gotten big, pachyderm.</i>

38:24.033 --> 38:25.632
<i>Your ears are huge.</i>

38:25.634 --> 38:28.335
Uh, thanks. Er, I think.

38:28.337 --> 38:31.705
<i>Yeah, I haven't seen you
since we left the circus.</i>

38:31.707 --> 38:32.940
<i>What you been up to?</i>

38:32.942 --> 38:34.841
Oh, you know, same old same old.

38:34.843 --> 38:36.810
I held down
an office job till today.

38:36.812 --> 38:40.181
Ha-ha. Learned to fly
a starship, saved the Zooverse.

38:40.183 --> 38:43.984
Ha-ha. You're still funny, Nuke.

38:43.986 --> 38:47.688
Maybe I should have been a comedian.
It'd be safer, that's for sure.

38:47.690 --> 38:50.091
Listen, Rudy.
I'll make this short and sweet.

38:50.093 --> 38:54.127
How would you like
to join me on the Nice Side

38:54.129 --> 38:58.132
and help defend the Zooverse against
an impending Mice Side attack?

38:58.134 --> 39:00.201
<i>An attack? But it's peacetime.</i>

39:00.203 --> 39:03.937
And peace is about to end
unless we defend it.

39:03.939 --> 39:05.640
<i>Oh, sounds exciting.</i>

39:05.642 --> 39:08.609
Sign him up, he's too dim
to fear anything.

39:08.611 --> 39:10.812
What do you say, old pal?
Are you with us?

39:10.814 --> 39:13.281
<i>Sure, what do we defend first?</i>

39:13.283 --> 39:17.351
Perhaps, um, us.
Not to alarm you, carbon-based,

39:17.353 --> 39:20.621
but it appears
as though we got visitors.

39:20.623 --> 39:21.688
It's Coot-Coot!

39:24.160 --> 39:26.361
Nice to see you, Nice Siders.

39:26.363 --> 39:29.897
I think it's time
for your demise.

39:31.134 --> 39:34.067
- Whoa!
- <i>You okay, Nuke?</i>

39:34.069 --> 39:37.038
<i>What's going on?
Are you still there?</i>

39:37.040 --> 39:39.806
We're hit.
Argh. Are we gonna die?

39:39.808 --> 39:44.078
Negative, elephant,
the damage is strictly cosmetic.

39:44.080 --> 39:46.080
Activating Deep Space lasers.

39:46.082 --> 39:47.915
Hang on, as you carbons say.

39:53.256 --> 39:57.158
Those lasers are strong, B-52.
Can we withstand this attack?

39:57.160 --> 40:01.663
No ones' ship's weaponry
can disable the B-52 Express.

40:09.772 --> 40:11.239
We're hit. We're hit.

40:11.241 --> 40:13.674
<i>Tell me where you are,
Nuke, I'm coming.</i>

40:13.676 --> 40:16.176
<i>I'll be there
like the old days at the circus.</i>

40:16.178 --> 40:18.045
<i>Remember the song?</i>

40:18.047 --> 40:20.080
<i>♪ I'll be there, my friend ♪</i>

40:20.082 --> 40:22.250
<i>♪ By your side ♪</i>

40:22.252 --> 40:25.152
<i>♪ I'll be there too ♪</i>

40:25.154 --> 40:27.821
Eh, eh. <i>♪ Let's take a ride ♪</i>

40:27.823 --> 40:33.460
<i>♪ To the canteen I'll
be with you ♪</i> Ah-ha-ha.

40:33.462 --> 40:39.701
<i>♪ No matter what
I'll be there too ♪</i>

40:39.703 --> 40:42.069
<i>Prepare for war Nice Siders.</i>

40:42.071 --> 40:44.071
Rudy, Rudy?

40:44.073 --> 40:46.140
We lost your circus pal, carbon.

40:46.142 --> 40:48.141
You're singing on your own now.

40:48.143 --> 40:50.377
Oh, geez!

40:50.379 --> 40:54.348
<i>♪ In hardship and in glee
I'll be there ♪</i>

40:54.350 --> 40:58.886
<i>♪ I'll be there,
My friend, you'll see ♪</i>

40:58.888 --> 41:01.188
<i>Take that, nicey-nice.</i>

41:01.190 --> 41:03.725
<i>And that, and that, and that!</i>

41:03.727 --> 41:08.795
Whoa, that's heavy artillery.
How many warships are out there?

41:08.797 --> 41:14.801
- Standby, carbon-based. My instruments read four.
- Four?!

41:14.803 --> 41:17.739
Whoa!

41:17.741 --> 41:21.141
Stop the universe,
I want to get off.

41:21.143 --> 41:26.748
<i>Kiss you're little behinds goodbye, peace-nicks.</i>

41:28.417 --> 41:32.520
<i>The Mice Side rules
the Zooverse.</i>

41:36.158 --> 41:38.259
<i>Fire!</i>

41:38.261 --> 41:41.795
We, we have to
do something, B-52.

41:41.797 --> 41:43.498
Uh, can we get out of here?

41:43.500 --> 41:46.366
Attempting, carbon-based.
Attempting.

41:46.368 --> 41:49.170
<i>Incredible, that tin can</i>

41:49.172 --> 41:52.306
<i>you call a ship
is still in one piece?</i>

41:52.308 --> 41:56.344
<i>Well, hello, B-52,
fancy seeing you here.</i>

41:56.346 --> 41:58.513
Kitty Clank, you cat.

41:58.515 --> 42:00.982
I should have known
you were involved.

42:00.984 --> 42:05.819
- You know him?
- Once upon a time, we were constructed in the same factory.

42:05.821 --> 42:09.891
Albeit me, from top of the line
components and from him scraps.

42:09.893 --> 42:13.426
Uh-huh, there's an after-hours
joke by bored technicians.

42:13.428 --> 42:16.429
They inserted a motherboard
into the abominable creation

42:16.431 --> 42:19.933
and it got away from them,
became self-aware.

42:19.935 --> 42:21.803
Took on a life of its own.

42:21.805 --> 42:25.505
Now, it's obviously aligned
with the Mice Side.

42:25.507 --> 42:30.377
Mice Side?
But he's a cat type thingy.

42:30.379 --> 42:34.080
Evil aligns itself
with evil, carbon-based.

42:34.082 --> 42:36.216
Mouse, cat, no matter.

42:36.218 --> 42:39.020
We're the enemy
in their equation.

42:39.022 --> 42:43.123
<i>Prepare to be
blasted to smithereens.</i>

42:45.962 --> 42:47.495
We're doomed.

42:47.497 --> 42:51.933
Never fear, carbon,
B-52 is here.

42:51.935 --> 42:53.533
- Oh, yeah?
- Indeed.

42:53.535 --> 42:56.203
I've had just about
enough of this craziness.

42:56.205 --> 42:58.306
Engage turbo thrusters.

42:58.308 --> 43:03.243
Hold on tight to your little
goofy tail, carbon. We're out of here.

43:13.022 --> 43:19.060
Ta-Ta, tell me, have you destroyed the Sparkle Express,

43:19.062 --> 43:25.933
that pesky elephant and that annoying
robot, my most despised foes?

43:25.935 --> 43:29.337
<i>We, uh, almost
destroyed it, Boo Boo.</i>

43:29.339 --> 43:33.107
What do you mean, almost?

43:33.109 --> 43:35.176
You either did or you didn't.

43:35.178 --> 43:38.578
<i>We attacked savagely and did
loads of damage, I can assure you.</i>

43:38.580 --> 43:44.051
- <i>But?</i>
- <i>But, uh, they were able to warp speed and they got away.</i>

43:44.053 --> 43:48.955
They didn't...
they... they got away?

43:48.957 --> 43:54.629
Argh! I assembled the greatest team
of vicious villains ever put together

43:54.631 --> 43:59.366
and they can't overtake a ship
named the Sparkle Express?

43:59.368 --> 44:03.437
Oh, when it's four on one?

44:03.439 --> 44:05.306
<i>We'll get them
next time, Boo Boo.</i>

44:05.308 --> 44:07.408
Next time? Argh!

44:07.410 --> 44:11.478
The proud space warrior Ta-Ta the
Third, son of Ta-Ta the Second

44:11.480 --> 44:16.150
and grandson of First Ta-Ta,
will get them next time?

44:16.152 --> 44:19.987
Argh! You know what?
You are fired!

44:19.989 --> 44:23.391
That's not the attitude
of a deputy commander.

44:23.393 --> 44:26.928
- <i>What about the Sauce you promised me?</i>
- What about it?

44:26.930 --> 44:30.964
If we can't even down a bucket of
bolts like the Sparkle Express,

44:30.966 --> 44:36.603
how can we expect to regain
the full power of the Sauce?

44:36.605 --> 44:38.371
We'll find the Sauce, Boo Boo.

44:38.373 --> 44:41.975
Uhm, it's too late for promises.

44:41.977 --> 44:44.011
You are fired, Ta-Ta.

44:44.013 --> 44:46.279
Go get an office job
or something, will you?

44:46.281 --> 44:49.549
You're not cut out
for this. Ooh.

44:49.551 --> 44:50.685
Chubby!

44:50.687 --> 44:51.719
Yes, Boo Boo?

44:51.721 --> 44:53.054
Fire him.

44:53.056 --> 44:54.522
Yes, Boo Boo.

44:56.491 --> 45:01.430
<i>But... but, Boo Boo!</i>

45:09.105 --> 45:12.172
<i>Wait a minute, eh, uh,
this looks familiar.</i>

45:12.174 --> 45:15.475
- <i>Are we in the...</i>
- <i>The Sauce Dimension.</i>

45:15.477 --> 45:19.080
- <i>But how... how did we...</i>
- <i>Our systems went into overdrive</i>

45:19.082 --> 45:21.681
<i>during the laser battle,
so when I hit warp speed</i>

45:21.683 --> 45:23.984
<i>it doubled down
on our trajectory.</i>

45:23.986 --> 45:26.654
<i>My calculations tell me
we were propelled</i>

45:26.656 --> 45:28.656
through a rip
in the space-time fabric,

45:28.658 --> 45:32.359
and were therefore
able to cross dimensions.

45:32.361 --> 45:36.163
- Whoa, that's gnarly.
- Indeed.

45:36.165 --> 45:39.533
What do we do now? Those Mice Side
ships are gonna be looking for us.

45:39.535 --> 45:42.036
In all probability, yes.

45:42.038 --> 45:46.073
You'll need to lay low for
a while as you carbon-bases say,

45:46.075 --> 45:48.174
assess the damage
to the Sparkle Express

45:48.176 --> 45:51.578
and utilize Sauce power
to reboot our systems.

45:51.580 --> 45:54.681
<i>If Boo Boo Squeal is able
to tap into the Sauce power again</i>

45:54.683 --> 45:57.118
<i>there may be no stopping him.</i>

45:57.120 --> 45:59.652
<i>That's the risk we face,
carbon-based.</i>

45:59.654 --> 46:03.623
Enough Sauce exists
to flood an entire dimension.

46:03.625 --> 46:06.159
If one were
to perform a simple tweak,

46:06.161 --> 46:11.065
like adding jalapeno,
it could be catastrophic to the Zooverse.

46:11.067 --> 46:13.266
Ah, well, I'm worried, B-52.

46:13.268 --> 46:16.703
Worry is not an emotion
that computes in my data-banks,

46:16.705 --> 46:20.207
but I share your sentiment
of great concern.

46:20.209 --> 46:24.748
- <i>So, you're worried?</i>
- <i>If you prefer.</i>

46:34.323 --> 46:39.393
Congratulations on your
promotion to Deputy Commander,

46:39.395 --> 46:41.127
Chewflies.

46:41.129 --> 46:44.397
I should have offered you
the position from the outset.

46:44.399 --> 46:49.502
<i>Yeah, you should've.
But hey, live, learn. Ha-ha.</i>

46:49.504 --> 46:54.074
<i>We won't slip up again,
I can assure you of that, Boo Boo.</i>

46:54.076 --> 46:59.612
I don't expect you to,
and I'd like to add to our ranks. Ha-ha.

46:59.614 --> 47:03.817
I thought I'd assembled
the ideal team,

47:03.819 --> 47:06.152
but now I'm not so sure.

47:06.154 --> 47:10.357
I need one more member.

47:10.359 --> 47:11.625
Oh, oh, yeah?

47:11.627 --> 47:14.527
- Someone cunning.
- Yes?

47:14.529 --> 47:18.199
- Someone ruthless.
- Whoa.

47:18.201 --> 47:24.404
Someone so absolutely,
undeniably, incredibly evil

47:24.406 --> 47:30.643
that the entire Zooverse will quake
in fear at the mere sight of them.

47:30.645 --> 47:36.283
- I'm ready, Boo Boo.
- <i>Hey, I think I know someone who fits the bill.</i>

47:36.285 --> 47:42.223
He-he. I'll call on Postal.

47:42.225 --> 47:46.127
- Postal? Oh.
- Postal?

47:46.129 --> 47:52.600
Uh, he lives on one of those bio
diverse planets in the Cumulon Galaxy.

47:52.602 --> 47:59.140
It's a real throwback.
Has an atmosphere, ice glaciers,

47:59.142 --> 48:03.277
mountain vistas,
rolling meadows. He-he.

48:03.279 --> 48:06.279
You know, the whole nine yards.

48:06.281 --> 48:09.216
Hu-ha, sounds like it's bigger
than nine yards to me.

48:09.218 --> 48:12.920
We might never find him.
We should pick someone closer.

48:12.922 --> 48:14.157
Hush, Chubby.

48:15.257 --> 48:17.625
I'm intrigued.

48:17.627 --> 48:21.562
Can you get me in touch
with this Postal character?

48:21.564 --> 48:25.833
Sure, I got his number
around here somewhere.

48:25.835 --> 48:29.303
I... I... I'll have him call you.

48:29.305 --> 48:32.772
Excellent. Mark my words.

48:32.774 --> 48:38.511
Once my army is at full strength
there will be no stopping us.

48:43.285 --> 48:44.185
That's right.

48:45.721 --> 48:48.455
- Oh, stop.
- What?

48:48.457 --> 48:51.591
Uh, just stop.
You're a pachyderm.

48:51.593 --> 48:54.328
It, it, it's silly
when you do it.

48:54.330 --> 48:55.462
Sorry, Boo Boo.

48:55.464 --> 48:57.330
Em, Chubby?

48:57.332 --> 48:59.966
That heel Ta-Ta the Third,

48:59.968 --> 49:04.772
said that the Sparkle Express
used warp speed

49:04.774 --> 49:06.806
to escape our attack.

49:06.808 --> 49:10.546
But they aren't
on our radar screens.

49:12.348 --> 49:14.781
So, where did they go?

49:14.783 --> 49:16.917
Uh, far away I guess.

49:16.919 --> 49:21.721
It would have to be
extraordinarily far away

49:21.723 --> 49:24.958
to evade our Goudas radar,

49:24.960 --> 49:26.759
unless...

49:26.761 --> 49:32.665
Unless it was
another dimension entirely,

49:32.667 --> 49:35.435
like the Sauce Dimension.

49:35.437 --> 49:37.870
Oh! Wow, you think?

49:37.872 --> 49:42.609
Chubby, prepare warp speed.
No coordinates.

49:42.611 --> 49:46.913
No coordinates? But, Boo Boo, we'd...
We could implode.

49:46.915 --> 49:51.652
So could the Sparkle Express,
he-he, but they didn't.

49:51.654 --> 49:54.955
And you can't tell me
they had time

49:54.957 --> 49:59.493
to enter coordinates under
intense laser fire from all sides.

49:59.495 --> 50:04.531
No, they just roll the cheese
cubes and took their chances.

50:04.533 --> 50:11.739
I think they landed right in the Sauce
Dimension, uh, uh, and so will we.

50:11.741 --> 50:15.942
The Sauce Dimension
calls all form into itself.

50:15.944 --> 50:18.647
We'll get there.
I... I'm sure of it.

50:19.582 --> 50:23.417
<i>You know, it's actually
kind of relaxing out here, B-52.</i>

50:23.419 --> 50:26.819
<i>Ah, yes. The Sauce
Dimension contains a unique aroma</i>

50:26.821 --> 50:32.493
that can lower carbon-based blood pressure,
as well as cholesterol and put one at ease.

50:32.495 --> 50:36.029
And in my case, it's like
instant component lube.

50:36.031 --> 50:40.701
It's, like, really chill.
I could get used to this.

50:40.703 --> 50:45.839
To be at one with the Sauce is to
inhabit this relaxed space all the time.

50:45.841 --> 50:49.009
You need only imagine it
and it's there for you.

50:49.011 --> 50:53.614
Umm, maybe one day when
I can just let go and be.

50:53.616 --> 50:56.817
You know, when the Mice Side
isn't gearing up for war with us.

50:56.819 --> 50:59.319
They won't find us here,
carbon-based.

50:59.321 --> 51:02.589
It's a very precise wrinkle
in the space-time continuum

51:02.591 --> 51:05.391
that leads
to the Sauce Dimension.

51:05.393 --> 51:08.795
And the odds
of Boo Boo Squeal finding it are

51:08.797 --> 51:13.433
4 trillion, 376 million,
802 thousand, 473...

51:13.435 --> 51:17.337
<i>Hello there, cheese brains.</i>

51:17.339 --> 51:19.473
...uh, one.

51:19.475 --> 51:20.741
So much for odds.

51:20.743 --> 51:23.476
<i>We meet again, Nice Siders.</i>

51:23.478 --> 51:28.382
<i>Now, if you don't mind,
ha-ha, pass the Sauce.</i>

51:28.384 --> 51:31.018
Boo Boo, allow me to remind you
that attacking us

51:31.020 --> 51:34.888
in the Sauce Dimension
is an astoundingly bad idea.

51:34.890 --> 51:37.623
<i>And why is that, rust bucket?</i>

51:37.625 --> 51:40.361
Or <i>are you bluffing?</i>

51:40.363 --> 51:44.630
<i>Your poker face is lousy,
whereas I won</i>

51:44.632 --> 51:49.770
<i>the Milky Way Millennial
Cheese Tournament back to back.</i>

51:49.772 --> 51:51.971
The Milky Way Millennial
Cheese Tournament?

51:51.973 --> 51:53.973
Wait, how old <i>are</i> you?

51:53.975 --> 51:58.545
<i>None of your business, elephant.
Never ask a mouse his age.</i>

51:58.547 --> 52:03.516
<i>You may have escaped my cohorts,
but you won't escape me.</i>

52:03.518 --> 52:08.621
<i>Now, prepare yourselves
to feel the Mice Side's wrath.</i>

52:10.459 --> 52:12.393
Very well, Boo Boo.

52:12.395 --> 52:13.926
You've got us right
where you want us.

52:13.928 --> 52:16.596
- Fire at will.
- Wait. Do... do... what?

52:16.598 --> 52:19.433
<i>So long, losers.</i>

52:19.435 --> 52:22.069
<i>Chubby, open fire.</i>

52:22.071 --> 52:23.937
<i>Activating lasers, Boo Boo.</i>

52:23.939 --> 52:26.873
- What just happened?
- They fired their lasers

52:26.875 --> 52:29.542
and were thrown back
from whence they came.

52:29.544 --> 52:33.080
There is no aggression
in the Sauce Dimension.

52:33.082 --> 52:36.716
Wow. You mean we're
totally safe here too?

52:36.718 --> 52:41.554
The Sauce Dimension is a pot of
tranquility in the chaotic Zooverse.

52:41.556 --> 52:44.824
All beings who enter it
can bask in its stillness,

52:44.826 --> 52:50.163
while all violator's actions are
reversed on those perpetrators.

52:50.165 --> 52:52.699
I feel like we should
be seated on the floor

52:52.701 --> 52:56.002
in one of those yoga poses
you were talking about.

52:56.004 --> 52:58.839
Well, you were circus-trained.

52:58.841 --> 53:00.908
I imagine
it's no problem for you.

53:00.910 --> 53:02.875
I didn't do the seat routines.

53:02.877 --> 53:04.844
I, I was more of a dancer.

53:04.846 --> 53:08.785
Oh, my. You learn
something new every day.

53:11.587 --> 53:17.056
What the... Where are...
Where did they go?

53:17.058 --> 53:19.859
And where's the Sauce?

53:19.861 --> 53:24.864
Uh, it looks like we're not in the
Sauce Dimension anymore, Boo Boo.

53:24.866 --> 53:27.868
I can see that,
you big log. Why not?

53:27.870 --> 53:30.136
I had those rubes
right where I wanted them.

53:30.138 --> 53:33.005
- You wanna try warp speed again?
- No.

53:33.007 --> 53:36.009
No, no, let them sweat.

53:36.011 --> 53:39.513
They know they can
only run for so long.

53:39.515 --> 53:45.152
And wherever they go, sooner
or later, we'll find them.

53:50.993 --> 53:52.893
Enough.

53:52.895 --> 53:56.062
<i>Hello, is this thing on?</i>

53:56.064 --> 53:59.900
Chubby, where is this
transmission coming from?

53:59.902 --> 54:04.071
Uh, hmm, looks like the
Cumulum Galaxy, Boo Boo.

54:04.073 --> 54:06.073
It must be Chewflies' friend.

54:06.075 --> 54:07.808
You, you know, Postal.

54:07.810 --> 54:09.710
<i>Dang the technology.</i>

54:09.712 --> 54:12.513
<i>Hello, can anyone hear me?</i>

54:12.515 --> 54:16.783
Oh, we hear you
loud and clear, Postal.

54:16.785 --> 54:21.054
<i>Hey.
Hey, how did you know my name?</i>

54:21.056 --> 54:23.156
<i>I did not hear
you say my name yet.</i>

54:23.158 --> 54:26.592
We're supposed
to recruit this nitwit?

54:26.594 --> 54:28.562
What's Zooverse coming to?

54:28.564 --> 54:33.799
The Mice Side is all-seeing
and all-knowing, Postal.

54:33.801 --> 54:38.971
- We've been anticipating your call.
- <i>That's crazy. He-he.</i>

54:38.973 --> 54:41.775
<i>So, how many would you like?</i>

54:41.777 --> 54:44.076
- What?
- <i>Cookies.</i>

54:44.078 --> 54:46.746
<i>How many
would you like to order?</i>

54:46.748 --> 54:50.083
<i>Is this just for you,
or for your whole crew?</i>

54:50.085 --> 54:52.853
Wait, er, what,
what are you talking about?

54:52.855 --> 54:56.123
What's this cookie business?
Is this code for something?

54:56.125 --> 55:00.159
<i>I only use a promo code
at Christmas time.</i>

55:00.161 --> 55:03.565
<i>Uh, do you celebrate
Christmas out there?</i>

55:04.232 --> 55:06.766
<i>We do here on my planet.</i>

55:06.768 --> 55:10.603
I think we're talking about two
different things here, Postal.

55:10.605 --> 55:14.074
I'm recruiting soldiers
to join the Mice Side

55:14.076 --> 55:17.076
and wage war
against the Zooverse.

55:17.078 --> 55:22.683
<i>Oh, ho-ho, I'm smelling
homemade cookies.</i>

55:22.685 --> 55:24.817
Oh, do you have oatmeal raisin?

55:24.819 --> 55:27.321
Shut up, Chubby! Listen, Postal.

55:27.323 --> 55:29.323
I don't have time
to mess around.

55:29.325 --> 55:33.594
War is coming.
And it's coming soon.

55:33.596 --> 55:37.797
The Mice Side will conquer
the Zooverse once and for all.

55:37.799 --> 55:42.835
And when that's achieved,
we'll move on to other galaxies

55:42.837 --> 55:45.004
like Cumulon.

55:45.006 --> 55:49.076
If you're smart,
you'll join us now.

55:49.078 --> 55:54.781
<i>Oh, you mean like a, like a,
a, uh, uh... corporate merger?</i>

55:54.783 --> 55:56.817
<i>Can I keep my cookie copyright?</i>

55:56.819 --> 55:58.185
<i>It's kind of my thing.</i>

55:58.187 --> 56:00.920
<i>Uh, it's my granny's recipe,
you see?</i>

56:00.922 --> 56:03.790
<i>It's all in the paprika.</i>

56:03.792 --> 56:06.025
I don't believe this.

56:06.027 --> 56:07.861
Am I being unclear?

56:07.863 --> 56:09.730
Maybe he's just
one-track minded?

56:09.732 --> 56:12.199
Or maybe he's unfit
to join the Mice Side.

56:12.201 --> 56:16.268
Postal, I'll explain
myself once more

56:16.270 --> 56:20.040
with as many single
syllable words as I can use.

56:20.042 --> 56:26.779
We're looking for a bad guy
to join our bad guy army

56:26.781 --> 56:28.915
and do bad things to good guys.

56:28.917 --> 56:31.784
<i>Oh! I see.</i>

56:31.786 --> 56:35.321
<i>I thought you were
a new cookie customer.</i>

56:35.323 --> 56:36.323
Feta me.

56:36.325 --> 56:40.192
<i>Uh, I'm kinda laid back,
you know.</i>

56:40.194 --> 56:43.996
<i>I don't think
I'd be real good in war time.</i>

56:43.998 --> 56:45.931
<i>Maybe in the kitchen patrol.</i>

56:45.933 --> 56:50.170
Yeah. Uh, I see that.
This whole thing's just a big mistake.

56:50.172 --> 56:54.207
I'll tell you what,
do you know any vicious types

56:54.209 --> 56:57.743
who'd be a good fit
for what we're doing?

56:57.745 --> 57:00.112
Someone who looks like you,

57:00.114 --> 57:05.851
but, uh, isn't so... uh, soft?

57:05.853 --> 57:08.989
<i>Hmm, let me think.</i>

57:08.991 --> 57:10.390
<i>Oh, I've got it.</i>

57:10.392 --> 57:14.694
<i>I know just
who you're looking for.</i>

57:14.696 --> 57:16.429
Wonderful. Tell me.

57:16.431 --> 57:19.833
<i>You need to talk
to Badgum and the Beep,</i>

57:19.835 --> 57:23.703
<i>they're the most savage
creatures you'll ever meet.</i>

57:23.705 --> 57:25.739
Sounds good.

57:25.741 --> 57:29.208
Where can I find
these Badgum and Beep people?

57:29.210 --> 57:33.846
<i>Oh, they're up at North in the
planet Bobo's glacial tundra.</i>

57:33.848 --> 57:38.752
<i>Be careful though.
It's not for the weak up there.</i>

57:38.754 --> 57:40.920
Hard terrain.

57:40.922 --> 57:42.855
I like it.

57:42.857 --> 57:45.491
Steel sharpen, steel.

57:45.493 --> 57:50.429
Uh, say, Postal, what's with the
name if you don't mind me asking?

57:50.431 --> 57:55.234
<i>Oh, that's on account
of our mail order business.</i>

57:55.236 --> 57:57.804
<i>Granny's cookies, yum-yum.</i>

57:57.806 --> 58:00.906
<i>He-he. You should
check it out sometime.</i>

58:00.908 --> 58:02.942
Oh, oh, boy. He-he.

58:02.944 --> 58:05.045
Yeah, I,
I'll, I'll do that sure.

58:05.047 --> 58:08.214
Chubby, get us out of here and chart
us to planet Bob-Bobo immediately.

58:08.216 --> 58:12.953
We'll orbit the Northern hemisphere
and locate these monsters at once.

58:12.955 --> 58:14.754
Right away, Boo Boo. Uh, oh.

58:14.756 --> 58:16.890
Before we sign off, do you think
I can place an order

58:16.892 --> 58:20.025
for some granny yum-yum
oatmeal raisin cookies?

58:20.027 --> 58:23.362
Mh-hmm, yeah. Uh, uh, go ahead.

58:23.364 --> 58:27.299
Oh, do, do you have
any macadamia nut also?

58:29.370 --> 58:32.772
Aah. Uh, this feels amazing.

58:32.774 --> 58:36.042
I never wanna leave.
I'm so at peace with this time

58:36.044 --> 58:40.212
in the Sauce Dimension, B-52.

58:40.214 --> 58:43.482
Well, you can begin ratcheting
the tension back up

58:43.484 --> 58:45.886
to an unbearable degree,
carbon-based.

58:45.888 --> 58:48.420
Since we've got to head back into
the deep space and open ourselves

58:48.422 --> 58:53.125
to attack from any number of Mice
Side agents who will be aiming for us,

58:53.127 --> 58:55.194
bent on our destruction.

58:55.196 --> 58:58.799
Thanks, that really
puts things in perspective.

58:58.801 --> 59:01.201
- Don't mention it.
- B-52, I have an idea.

59:01.203 --> 59:05.906
Now, hear me out. I know she's
out of range of our technology,

59:05.908 --> 59:11.344
but maybe we could contact Princess
Sparklefeather using Sauce power?

59:11.346 --> 59:14.214
That is an interesting
proposition, carbon-based,

59:14.216 --> 59:18.951
and not hopelessly out of the
question, like some of your other ones.

59:18.953 --> 59:21.353
Uh, he-he, thanks.

59:21.355 --> 59:23.223
So, should we give it a shot?

59:23.225 --> 59:25.225
We're strong
with the Sauce right now.

59:25.227 --> 59:27.861
This might be our best chance.

59:27.863 --> 59:32.199
Indeed, it may be.
I see no harm in attempting it.

59:32.201 --> 59:35.402
Great! Here goes.

59:35.404 --> 59:40.507
Princess Sparklefeather,
hear me.

59:40.509 --> 59:46.513
It's Nuke Tiptoes
and we're in grave danger.

59:46.515 --> 59:49.583
The Mice Side
has broken our peace treaty

59:49.585 --> 59:53.053
and is trying to start war
with the Zooverse.

59:53.055 --> 59:56.857
We seek your guidance, Princess.

59:56.859 --> 01:00:00.259
We need our leader.

01:00:00.261 --> 01:00:05.565
- What do you think?
- Little ham-handed, but you are a flesh and bone organism.

01:00:05.567 --> 01:00:07.567
Well, maybe
it got through anyway.

01:00:07.569 --> 01:00:10.971
Should I try again? More? Less?

01:00:10.973 --> 01:00:15.040
I'd let that one breathe
to see if it connects.

01:00:15.042 --> 01:00:16.542
You touched on the key points.

01:00:16.544 --> 01:00:19.145
- Right?
- Alright then.

01:00:19.147 --> 01:00:22.248
Preparing to exit
the Sauce Dimension.

01:00:22.250 --> 01:00:25.287
Oh, to leave is to die a little.

01:00:34.161 --> 01:00:38.632
Well, here we are.
Back in the Zooverse, carbon-based.

01:00:38.634 --> 01:00:42.234
It looks just
like we left it. No war yet.

01:00:42.236 --> 01:00:43.603
<i>There you are.</i>

01:00:43.605 --> 01:00:45.938
I've been looking
for you guys everywhere.

01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:47.908
<i>Rudy told me you were
ambushed out there.</i>

01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:49.942
- <i>Where did you go?</i>
- Long story, Marty.

01:00:49.944 --> 01:00:52.913
But we're okay and that's
what matters right now.

01:00:52.915 --> 01:00:54.179
<i>Awesome!</i>

01:00:54.181 --> 01:00:56.551
Oh, call me Slim,
remember? Slim.

01:00:57.352 --> 01:01:00.654
<i>Hey, I've been meaning to talk to you.
It's so busy at work.</i>

01:01:00.656 --> 01:01:02.621
<i>They haven't hired
a replacement for you yet,</i>

01:01:02.623 --> 01:01:05.158
<i>so I'm taking on
all your paperwork.</i>

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:07.560
<i>I may have to cut back
on my fighting time again.</i>

01:01:07.562 --> 01:01:10.062
<i>If that's okay and everything,
you know, because I did...</i>

01:01:10.064 --> 01:01:11.665
Oh, uh, sure, Slim.

01:01:11.667 --> 01:01:13.533
We wouldn't wanna get you
in trouble at work.

01:01:13.535 --> 01:01:16.236
<i>Oh, good, thanks.
I appreciate that.</i>

01:01:16.238 --> 01:01:19.038
How's it going on locating
the Gouda and Boo Boo Squeal?

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:22.074
<i>Uh, still working on that.
Uh, uh, stand by.</i>

01:01:22.076 --> 01:01:25.078
Kitty Clank's ship approaching.

01:01:31.486 --> 01:01:34.386
<i>We're hit again.
This is just too much!</i>

01:01:34.388 --> 01:01:36.957
Hold on to your trunk, carbon.

01:01:36.959 --> 01:01:38.091
We're back in action.

01:01:40.261 --> 01:01:42.194
Marty, uh, I mean, Slim.

01:01:42.196 --> 01:01:44.998
Can you scramble his commands
and get him off our tail?

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.533
<i>Easy-peasy, Nuke.</i>

01:01:46.535 --> 01:01:49.337
<i>You know my tech skills
are legendary. Hu-hum.</i>

01:01:50.105 --> 01:01:52.973
<i>Maybe I should change
my name to Techno-Slim.</i>

01:01:52.975 --> 01:01:57.109
Slim is good, Marty. Let's just
stick to the Slim right now, alright?

01:01:57.111 --> 01:02:00.647
- Can you scramble Kitty Clank's commands, pretty please?
- <i>I'm on it.</i>

01:02:00.649 --> 01:02:04.016
No one stands up to the Mice Side

01:02:04.018 --> 01:02:06.652
and no one survives Kitty Clank.

01:02:06.654 --> 01:02:10.357
- How long, Slim?
- <i>Hold on. Uh, almost there.</i>

01:02:10.359 --> 01:02:12.692
- Marty?
- <i>Slim. Oh, wait.</i>

01:02:12.694 --> 01:02:16.663
<i>I just got a bunch of papers from work
I have to decode. I'll be right back.</i>

01:02:16.665 --> 01:02:21.067
<i>Prepare to meet your destiny, Nice Siders.</i>

01:02:21.069 --> 01:02:25.004
- Slim!
- Looks like we got company, carbon-based.

01:02:25.006 --> 01:02:27.306
A vessel is approaching.
Two o'clock.

01:02:27.308 --> 01:02:29.042
Friends or foes?

01:02:29.044 --> 01:02:31.544
I'm not privy
to that information, elephant.

01:02:31.546 --> 01:02:34.547
Could be either, I'd say.

01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:37.016
Oh, great. We're finished.

01:02:41.556 --> 01:02:45.658
Hey, it's Banana Rama.
Long time no see, pal.

01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:50.062
<i>For the infinite time,
my name is B-52.</i>

01:02:50.064 --> 01:02:53.098
<i>Aah! I'll let it slide
this time on account</i>

01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:56.603
<i>of your venerable age,
Commander Ham Sanders.</i>

01:02:56.605 --> 01:02:59.538
Ah, Banana Shamana,
let it go, will you?

01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:01.743
Life is too short
to get hung up on the name.

01:03:02.511 --> 01:03:07.179
Look at me, I don't even know where I
am right now, and I'm still doing great.

01:03:07.181 --> 01:03:10.650
That is very Zen of you,
Commander Ham Sanders.

01:03:10.652 --> 01:03:14.453
- Commander Ham Sanders, who is he?
- Old pal of mine.

01:03:14.455 --> 01:03:20.259
He fought the battle of Zorex until all that
was left of him were boats and his dentures,

01:03:20.261 --> 01:03:24.696
and still defeated the entire
Zorex army on his own.

01:03:24.698 --> 01:03:26.799
Wow!

01:03:26.801 --> 01:03:31.337
Oh, they don't make heroes
like that anymore.

01:03:31.339 --> 01:03:33.540
How in the universe
are you, honey?

01:03:33.542 --> 01:03:38.444
I'm alright, besides these darn, rusty
butt bolts that are giving me a hard time.

01:03:38.446 --> 01:03:42.815
<i>Ah, butt bolts are a pain
when they flare up, but...</i>

01:03:42.817 --> 01:03:46.219
- <i>Who is the shrimp?</i>
- Hello there, nice to see you.

01:03:46.221 --> 01:03:48.455
This shrimpy alien form?
Not sure.

01:03:48.457 --> 01:03:52.458
I woke up this morning and I was in
this space pod next to a shrimpy thing.

01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:55.361
No idea how I got here,
and how to get out.

01:03:55.363 --> 01:03:57.732
I'm, uh, taking life
as it comes.

01:03:59.301 --> 01:04:01.667
We are on a mission to help the Nice
Side, Commander Ham Sanders.

01:04:01.669 --> 01:04:04.504
- Princess Sparklefeather sent us, remember?
- Uh, nope.

01:04:04.506 --> 01:04:07.207
She was honeymooning at the Twin
Island Planets when she intercepted

01:04:07.209 --> 01:04:10.275
a call for help from the
Sparkle Express and here we are.

01:04:12.647 --> 01:04:15.348
Ah, we're hit. We're hit!

01:04:15.350 --> 01:04:17.382
Positive.
Our weapons are jammed.

01:04:17.384 --> 01:04:20.453
We're losing power.
One more hit and we're smoke.

01:04:20.455 --> 01:04:23.123
- Oh, great.
- I see you're having a problem

01:04:23.125 --> 01:04:25.658
with that pesky metal kitty.
Need a hand?

01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:29.161
<i>If you don't mind. We've got a
lot on our plate at the moment.</i>

01:04:29.163 --> 01:04:32.531
- <i>Could you give us a boost?</i>
- I'll do you one better.

01:04:32.533 --> 01:04:34.868
How about the brand new
plutonium hydrolyzer?

01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:37.770
I'll let you have it
for 10,000 space bucks.

01:04:37.772 --> 01:04:42.674
- Ha-ha. I'll do that for you.
- Commander Ham Sanders, we don't have time for this right now.

01:04:42.676 --> 01:04:44.310
Let's just give
these guys a boost.

01:04:44.312 --> 01:04:46.545
Alright, fine. Boost them up.

01:04:49.350 --> 01:04:52.317
Wow. You guys are rad.

01:04:52.319 --> 01:04:55.154
Commencing nuclear warp speed.

01:04:55.156 --> 01:04:56.688
Stay safe out there.

01:04:56.690 --> 01:04:57.790
Will do.

01:04:57.792 --> 01:04:59.826
Nuclear warp speed engaged.

01:04:59.828 --> 01:05:03.431
<i>Hey, uh, where are you going?</i>

01:05:07.169 --> 01:05:08.902
Oh, that was close.

01:05:08.904 --> 01:05:10.937
Believe it or not,
that Ham Sanders

01:05:10.939 --> 01:05:13.839
was a strapping
young robot at one time.

01:05:13.841 --> 01:05:16.511
Yeah, I'll take
your word for it.

01:05:19.781 --> 01:05:22.315
<i>Here we are, Chubby.</i>

01:05:22.317 --> 01:05:26.518
Planet Bobo-Bobo.
Those ice glaciers are vast,

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:29.821
but we'll know our targets
when we see them.

01:05:29.823 --> 01:05:37.429
They'll be the most savage, mighty,
terrifying beasts this planet has to offer.

01:05:37.431 --> 01:05:38.665
<i>Meek.</i>

01:05:38.667 --> 01:05:41.904
Eh, uh, er... What's this thing?

01:05:42.671 --> 01:05:47.339
He's transmitting from the icy caps
of Bobo-Bobo, most evilest Boo Boo.

01:05:47.341 --> 01:05:48.607
Do you wish to communicate?

01:05:48.609 --> 01:05:51.743
Bobo-Bobo?
There must be a mistake.

01:05:51.745 --> 01:05:55.214
This cannot surely be
the monstrous creature we seek.

01:05:55.216 --> 01:05:57.750
Must be another
space cookie peddler.

01:05:57.752 --> 01:05:59.685
You think? Oh, goody.

01:05:59.687 --> 01:06:02.955
Chubby! We don't have
time for cookies.

01:06:02.957 --> 01:06:06.859
We're assembling
an army of savages.

01:06:06.861 --> 01:06:08.460
Oh, he-he, okay.

01:06:08.462 --> 01:06:10.596
- <i>Meek.</i>
- That's right, Beep.

01:06:10.598 --> 01:06:14.234
I am Boo Boo Squeal.

01:06:14.236 --> 01:06:19.239
Leader of the Mice Side
and I'm seeking Badgum and Beep.

01:06:19.241 --> 01:06:22.507
I hear they are ruthless.

01:06:22.509 --> 01:06:27.446
- <i>Meek.</i>
- If you know where they are, speak up.

01:06:27.448 --> 01:06:30.250
Reveal their lair.

01:06:30.252 --> 01:06:33.652
I have a proposition

01:06:33.654 --> 01:06:36.922
for them, they can't refuse.

01:06:38.393 --> 01:06:41.361
- <i>Meek, meek, meek.</i>
- Get the coordinates

01:06:41.363 --> 01:06:42.995
to this urchin, Chubby.

01:06:42.997 --> 01:06:46.665
Don't let it out
of your sight, obviously.

01:06:46.667 --> 01:06:49.701
It's leading us
to those warriors.

01:06:49.703 --> 01:06:51.339
Coordinates locked, Boo Boo.

01:06:57.544 --> 01:07:00.379
Well, we got away
from Kitty Clank's claws.

01:07:00.381 --> 01:07:03.683
I wonder how many more things
Boo Boo has in store for us.

01:07:03.685 --> 01:07:08.288
He only needs a gang because he
hasn't yet gained full Sauce power.

01:07:08.290 --> 01:07:12.859
If he does that,
he'll be a one-mouse army again,

01:07:12.861 --> 01:07:15.295
and no one will be able
to stop him.

01:07:15.297 --> 01:07:17.330
But we stopped him
once before, B.

01:07:17.332 --> 01:07:19.299
Don't you think
we can do it again?

01:07:19.301 --> 01:07:22.301
I believe in the Sauce,
carbon-based.

01:07:22.303 --> 01:07:25.873
With the Sauce,
all things are possible.

01:07:26.674 --> 01:07:28.708
<i>Greetings, Nice Siders.</i>

01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:31.576
Whoa! Princess Sparklefeather.

01:07:31.578 --> 01:07:33.980
My heavens. It's the Princess.

01:07:33.982 --> 01:07:38.618
I heard your message, Nuke. I've been waiting
for you to get closer, so that I can respond.

01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:39.986
Incredible!

01:07:39.988 --> 01:07:43.323
- I wielded Sauce power.
- You did, Nuke.

01:07:43.325 --> 01:07:45.958
It was very smart of you to call
from the Sauce Dimension.

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:48.094
Otherwise, I'd have
never known of this menace.

01:07:48.096 --> 01:07:51.330
I hope Commander Ham Sanders
was of help in your mission.

01:07:51.332 --> 01:07:55.000
Yes. He saved us
from Kitty Clanks claws.

01:07:55.002 --> 01:07:57.603
Wonderful. Hammy's
never let me down.

01:07:57.605 --> 01:08:01.540
Princess, Boo Boo's dispatched a gang
of bounty hunters to come after us.

01:08:01.542 --> 01:08:05.611
He was even able to enter the Sauce
Dimension while we were there.

01:08:05.613 --> 01:08:10.482
This is terrible news. So,
Boo Boo's really intent on restarting war?

01:08:10.484 --> 01:08:14.353
Yeah, but... but he hasn't gotten his
little rodent hands on full Sauce power yet

01:08:14.355 --> 01:08:17.823
and he won't if we have
anything to say about it.

01:08:17.826 --> 01:08:19.792
I'll handle
Boo Boo Squeal, Nuke.

01:08:19.794 --> 01:08:22.661
But Princess,
your honeymoon! You'll let...

01:08:22.662 --> 01:08:25.029
Honeymoon? Ugh, I'm bored.

01:08:25.032 --> 01:08:28.066
I wanna return to my warrior
princley duties at once.

01:08:28.068 --> 01:08:31.770
Hooray for
Princess Sparklefeather.

01:08:31.773 --> 01:08:33.772
Hooray!

01:08:33.774 --> 01:08:38.313
Oh, what kind
of trickery is this?

01:08:39.912 --> 01:08:43.048
You creatures had better
stop wasting my time.

01:08:43.050 --> 01:08:48.053
I'm seeking the fierce warriors
Badgum and Beep.

01:08:48.055 --> 01:08:49.488
<i>That's us.</i>

01:08:49.491 --> 01:08:50.654
<i>I'm Badgum.</i>

01:08:50.657 --> 01:08:51.691
<i>He's Beep.</i>

01:08:51.693 --> 01:08:53.459
You've got to be kidding.

01:08:53.461 --> 01:08:56.127
Is this some kind of joke?

01:08:56.130 --> 01:08:57.529
<i>No.</i>

01:08:57.532 --> 01:08:59.064
What do you want, mister?

01:08:59.067 --> 01:09:01.933
You mean to tell me we located

01:09:01.935 --> 01:09:06.341
that little ball
of fluffy feather for this?

01:09:07.942 --> 01:09:09.609
Oh, boy.

01:09:09.611 --> 01:09:11.143
They're so cute.

01:09:11.145 --> 01:09:14.045
- I think I'm going to melt.
- Chubby?

01:09:14.046 --> 01:09:16.048
- Yes, Boo Boo?
- Uh, shut it.

01:09:16.050 --> 01:09:19.118
I was told you two
are the most vicious specimens

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:22.687
this planet has to offer,
is this true?

01:09:22.689 --> 01:09:24.457
We are vicious.

01:09:24.459 --> 01:09:26.959
- You are?
- Absolutely.

01:09:26.961 --> 01:09:29.594
- <i>Meek, Meek.</i>
- What can you do?

01:09:29.595 --> 01:09:31.696
We get them with cuteness.

01:09:31.698 --> 01:09:34.966
You... You what?

01:09:34.969 --> 01:09:37.904
<i>We're so impossibly cute,
you see.</i>

01:09:37.906 --> 01:09:42.575
OMG. They are
so unbelievably cute.

01:09:42.577 --> 01:09:44.776
Uh, I think I'm going to burst.

01:09:44.778 --> 01:09:46.145
That's how we work.

01:09:46.147 --> 01:09:49.147
We get them
with ultimate cuteness.

01:09:49.149 --> 01:09:53.852
Nobody can survive
our cuteness. Nobody.

01:09:53.854 --> 01:09:59.091
If you want to hire us,
it'll cost you a bucket of sardines.

01:09:59.093 --> 01:10:00.927
- MeeK.
- Two buckets.

01:10:00.929 --> 01:10:04.629
I think I'm getting a migraine.

01:10:04.631 --> 01:10:06.097
Do you need your fish oil,
Boo Boo?

01:10:06.099 --> 01:10:09.067
No, I don't need my fish oil.

01:10:09.069 --> 01:10:13.772
Argh! I need
evil scary creatures

01:10:13.774 --> 01:10:17.610
to assemble my army.

01:10:17.612 --> 01:10:20.213
I need to get that Sauce.

01:10:20.215 --> 01:10:28.053
If I can just regain full Sauce
power, all of this can go away.

01:10:28.055 --> 01:10:30.957
No more mouthy pachyderms.

01:10:30.959 --> 01:10:32.859
No more bumbling henchmen.

01:10:32.861 --> 01:10:36.628
No more fluffy space penguins.

01:10:36.630 --> 01:10:40.866
Oh, just Sauce.

01:10:40.868 --> 01:10:44.870
Flowing, boiling,

01:10:44.872 --> 01:10:48.140
bubbling, churning Sauce.

01:10:48.142 --> 01:10:50.642
Uh-hu-huh...

01:10:50.644 --> 01:10:55.280
- Pouring, puddling...
- Boo Boo.

01:10:55.282 --> 01:10:59.685
Sauce! Uh, Sauce!

01:10:59.687 --> 01:11:01.020
Hey, Boo Boo!

01:11:01.022 --> 01:11:04.723
All the Sauce power.

01:11:04.725 --> 01:11:06.691
- Boo Boo!
- What?

01:11:06.693 --> 01:11:07.929
Look.

01:11:08.929 --> 01:11:10.695
The Sauce Dimension?

01:11:10.697 --> 01:11:14.299
You did it, Boo Boo. We're back
in the Sauce Dimension.

01:11:14.301 --> 01:11:15.901
I did it.

01:11:15.903 --> 01:11:18.036
I did it!

01:11:18.038 --> 01:11:21.908
The Zooverse is mine.

01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:25.613
Uh, Boo Boo.
Yeah, I think we have company.

01:11:33.621 --> 01:11:35.620
Princess Sparklefeather.

01:11:35.622 --> 01:11:37.088
Hello again, Boo Boo.

01:11:37.090 --> 01:11:40.993
Uh, what are you doing here?

01:11:40.995 --> 01:11:44.262
I came to stop
your impossibly evil plans.

01:11:44.264 --> 01:11:45.964
Oh, yeah?

01:11:45.966 --> 01:11:49.334
We shall see about that.

01:11:49.336 --> 01:11:53.573
I'm glad you're here.

01:11:53.575 --> 01:11:57.944
We have unfinished business,
you and I.

01:11:57.946 --> 01:12:00.279
I thought we had settled
our business, Boo Boo.

01:12:00.281 --> 01:12:07.587
As you can clearly see,
I've regained Sauce power.

01:12:07.589 --> 01:12:09.789
The peace treaty is over.

01:12:09.791 --> 01:12:15.660
It's war, Princess, and there's
nothing you can do about it!

01:12:15.662 --> 01:12:17.228
That's where you're
wrong, Boo Boo.

01:12:17.230 --> 01:12:20.732
You may be strong
with the Sauce, but so am I.

01:12:20.734 --> 01:12:24.770
Are you challenging me?

01:12:24.772 --> 01:12:28.807
Indeed I am. Come at me, Boo.
Let's see what you got.

01:12:28.809 --> 01:12:34.015
Mushroom Sauce and Tartar Sauce.

01:12:34.881 --> 01:12:37.283
Mayonnaise Sauce.

01:12:37.285 --> 01:12:39.619
That's powerful Sauce, Boo Boo.

01:12:39.621 --> 01:12:44.890
Yes,
You underestimated me, Princess.

01:12:44.892 --> 01:12:48.026
Now you and all of the Zooverse

01:12:48.028 --> 01:12:52.731
will feel my wrath.

01:12:52.733 --> 01:12:54.299
Not so fast, mouse.

01:12:54.301 --> 01:12:57.035
- Eh, eh, eh?
- Mayonnaise.

01:12:57.037 --> 01:13:02.775
Oh, ow. Ow, you crafty,
pink pachyderm, you.

01:13:02.777 --> 01:13:04.776
- Ponzu.
- Ow.

01:13:04.778 --> 01:13:06.712
- Sambal.
- Argh!

01:13:06.714 --> 01:13:11.219
If it's a fight you
want, it's a fight you'll get.

01:13:12.653 --> 01:13:15.053
Sauce Choron.

01:13:15.055 --> 01:13:17.356
Oh. Hollandaise.

01:13:17.358 --> 01:13:20.058
Agrodolce.

01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:23.928
Oh, no, agrodolce? No.

01:13:23.930 --> 01:13:25.765
Ha-ha. Eh, give up?

01:13:25.767 --> 01:13:29.000
Don't make me laugh.
I will never give up.

01:13:29.002 --> 01:13:33.239
Surrender and join me, Princess.

01:13:33.241 --> 01:13:38.009
The Mice Side
could use your talents.

01:13:38.011 --> 01:13:40.780
Me? Join the Mice Side? Never.

01:13:40.782 --> 01:13:46.118
Very well then,
you leave me no choice

01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:49.922
but to destroy you.

01:13:49.924 --> 01:13:52.258
<i>Tkemali!</i>

01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:55.761
- Oh.
- <i>Gochujang!</i>

01:13:57.064 --> 01:14:00.365
- Oh!
- Gravy!

01:14:00.367 --> 01:14:01.967
No!

01:14:09.042 --> 01:14:11.377
<i>Time's up, Nice Siders.</i>

01:14:11.379 --> 01:14:13.846
<i>Prepare to meet your maker.</i>

01:14:13.848 --> 01:14:17.115
Time to turn up the heat
on the burners, carbon-based.

01:14:17.117 --> 01:14:21.887
Are you familiar with the term,
"The best defense is a good offense?"

01:14:21.889 --> 01:14:23.388
I sure am, B.

01:14:26.993 --> 01:14:30.295
<i>Is that all you've got
in your nicey-nice cannons?</i>

01:14:30.297 --> 01:14:33.466
<i>Take this.</i>

01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:50.281
You never should have
come back here, Princess.

01:14:50.283 --> 01:14:56.321
Your miscalculation
will be your undoing.

01:14:56.323 --> 01:14:59.758
Surrender, Boo Boo.
Surrender to your true nature.

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:01.893
I know there's good in you,
Boo Boo.

01:15:01.895 --> 01:15:04.096
You too have a nice side.

01:15:04.098 --> 01:15:06.832
Ah. Wow.

01:15:06.834 --> 01:15:08.433
What did you say?

01:15:08.435 --> 01:15:13.004
Time to finish this,
Sparklefeather.

01:15:13.006 --> 01:15:16.808
Arrabiata sauce.

01:15:16.810 --> 01:15:20.748
- Oh.
- Cocktail sauce.

01:15:21.381 --> 01:15:26.084
- Oh.
- Devil's hot sauce.

01:15:26.086 --> 01:15:29.288
I know mice can be nice.

01:15:29.290 --> 01:15:33.057
You know what? Ew, no, never.

01:15:33.059 --> 01:15:38.931
Look within, search yourself,
there is nice, mice can be nice.

01:15:38.933 --> 01:15:43.835
No, no, no. I'm not nice.

01:15:43.837 --> 01:15:45.804
Uh, Boo Boo.

01:15:45.806 --> 01:15:48.007
Not now, Chubby.

01:15:48.009 --> 01:15:53.945
Kiss your Nice Side and a Zooverse
goodbye, Sparklefeather.

01:15:53.947 --> 01:15:57.082
It's all mine now.

01:16:02.924 --> 01:16:04.990
Just one more thing, Boo Boo.

01:16:04.992 --> 01:16:08.259
Oh, last words?

01:16:08.261 --> 01:16:13.164
By all means,
what have you got to say?

01:16:13.166 --> 01:16:14.866
Hmm?

01:16:14.868 --> 01:16:16.368
Uh, Boo Boo?

01:16:16.370 --> 01:16:17.837
Shhh.

01:16:17.839 --> 01:16:22.441
Go ahead, Princess, out with it.

01:16:22.443 --> 01:16:24.243
- Duck sauce.
- What?

01:16:24.245 --> 01:16:25.878
And <i>Thua</i> sauce.

01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:28.547
But, how? Huh?

01:16:28.549 --> 01:16:33.619
Boo Boo, uh, we're approaching the Nebula Nine
wormhole. Do you want me to reverse thrusters?

01:16:33.621 --> 01:16:36.422
Eh, aw... What?

01:16:36.424 --> 01:16:37.556
<i>Soubise.</i>

01:16:37.558 --> 01:16:40.325
Aah! Stop.

01:16:40.327 --> 01:16:41.593
<i>Au jus veal.</i>

01:16:41.595 --> 01:16:43.262
No!

01:16:43.264 --> 01:16:45.263
<i>Baham</i> pepper sauce.

01:16:45.265 --> 01:16:48.167
Aw, oh, no.

01:16:48.169 --> 01:16:50.535
Oh, no, no!

01:16:50.537 --> 01:16:52.503
No!

01:16:52.505 --> 01:16:55.307
Boo Boo, we're nearing
the Nebula Nine vacuum,

01:16:55.309 --> 01:16:57.409
we need to reverse
course now or never.

01:16:57.411 --> 01:16:59.445
He can't give the order, Chubby.

01:16:59.447 --> 01:17:01.146
You need to think for yourself.

01:17:01.148 --> 01:17:03.449
Boo Boo is busy
with a stare-down.

01:17:03.451 --> 01:17:05.217
Uh, think for myself?

01:17:05.219 --> 01:17:07.018
Oh boy, oh boy. Ha-ha.

01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:10.021
I get to be the villain
for a change. Goodie.

01:17:10.023 --> 01:17:13.160
Uh-uhm, what would a villain do?

01:17:14.528 --> 01:17:17.228
Coot-Coot's gonna
blast us to bits, B-52.

01:17:17.230 --> 01:17:19.565
Unless he runs out
of laser ammunition,

01:17:19.567 --> 01:17:21.967
or we get him first,
carbon-based.

01:17:21.969 --> 01:17:23.302
Keep firing.

01:17:23.304 --> 01:17:25.003
Don't worry, I will.

01:17:31.578 --> 01:17:33.678
<i>Hey guys, I'm back.</i>

01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:34.980
Rudy.

01:17:34.982 --> 01:17:37.516
Never happier to see you.

01:17:37.518 --> 01:17:42.320
<i>♪ I'll be there my friend

01:17:42.322 --> 01:17:45.124

01:18:07.014 --> 01:18:10.516
Enough singing and a little
more action here, guys.

01:18:10.518 --> 01:18:13.285
- By all means, say goodbye, Kit-Kit.
- <i>Oh, no!</i>

01:18:18.392 --> 01:18:23.262
This isn't over.

01:18:23.264 --> 01:18:26.164
It is for you, Coot-Coot.

01:18:26.166 --> 01:18:28.334
Oh, wow, I'm dizzy.

01:18:28.336 --> 01:18:30.668
That's a common
carbon-based weakness.

01:18:30.670 --> 01:18:34.239
Focus on
a fixed point and breathe.

01:18:34.241 --> 01:18:35.341
Did I do good?

01:18:35.343 --> 01:18:37.276
You did great, Rudy, thanks.

01:18:37.278 --> 01:18:39.110
Huh. Eh, any time.

01:18:39.112 --> 01:18:41.713
Hold on, there's another
transmission coming in.

01:18:41.715 --> 01:18:45.718
<i>There are you guys are. Why do move so fast?</i>

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:49.722
That's the way we do things out
here in space, cubicle creature.

01:18:49.724 --> 01:18:52.223
- Slim.
- <i>Oh, that reminds me,</i>

01:18:52.225 --> 01:18:54.459
<i>I've been thinking
about this name thing,</i>

01:18:54.461 --> 01:18:56.261
<i>Slim Green Star
sounds cool and everything,</i>

01:18:56.263 --> 01:18:59.464
<i>but I don't think it's really
kinda for me, you know?</i>

01:18:59.466 --> 01:19:00.999
<i>I'm gonna stick with Marty.</i>

01:19:01.001 --> 01:19:04.003
Oh, I think that's
a great idea, Marty.

01:19:04.005 --> 01:19:05.503
Any news on the Gouda?

01:19:05.505 --> 01:19:07.472
Yep, okay, I finally got
coordinates.

01:19:07.474 --> 01:19:09.008
It's coming right for you.

01:19:09.010 --> 01:19:11.543
What?
The, the Gouda is coming for us?

01:19:11.545 --> 01:19:16.015
It is indeed.
It's Boo Boo Squeal.

01:19:16.017 --> 01:19:17.548
What's he doing?

01:19:17.550 --> 01:19:19.517
They're nearing
the Nebula Nine wormhole.

01:19:26.193 --> 01:19:29.660
Your contempt for the Zooverse
is turning against you, Boo Boo.

01:19:29.662 --> 01:19:32.196
Repent and join the Nice Side.

01:19:32.198 --> 01:19:34.133
Join you?

01:19:35.603 --> 01:19:39.338
You must be living on Sauce.

01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:40.638
It's the Sparkle Express.

01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:43.042
Alright, it's time
to play villain

01:19:43.044 --> 01:19:45.343
while Boo Boo is busy
in the stare-down.

01:19:45.345 --> 01:19:46.779
Arming laser guns.

01:19:46.781 --> 01:19:50.048
Yes, yes, yes.

01:19:50.050 --> 01:19:51.417
Fire.

01:19:53.453 --> 01:19:55.219
<i>Take that,
Sparkle Express.</i>

01:19:55.221 --> 01:19:59.191
<i>I'm an evil pachyderm.</i>

01:19:59.193 --> 01:20:01.259
<i>I'm so evil.</i>

01:20:01.261 --> 01:20:02.761
Not again.

01:20:02.763 --> 01:20:06.198
Hold on tight, living organism.

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:12.570
Someone's Sauce power
must win, Princess.

01:20:12.572 --> 01:20:15.274
I agree, Boo Boo, bring it.

01:20:15.276 --> 01:20:17.776
- Peanut.
- Tomato sauce.

01:20:17.778 --> 01:20:19.477
Chutney.

01:20:19.479 --> 01:20:21.713
- Oh.
- Pesto.

01:20:21.715 --> 01:20:24.348
Eugh.

01:20:24.350 --> 01:20:25.750
Soy.

01:20:25.752 --> 01:20:27.518
No. Creole.

01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:32.624
Ooh, you're a formidable
foe, Princess.

01:20:32.626 --> 01:20:37.096
It's going to be
a shame to defeat you. Ha-ha.

01:20:37.098 --> 01:20:40.399
Likewise, Boo Boo.
It's not too late.

01:20:40.401 --> 01:20:44.735
Eh, oh, but it is,
pink pachyderm.

01:20:44.737 --> 01:20:46.538
It is.

01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:50.776
- Sauce <i>Espagnole.</i>
- Salsa.

01:20:50.778 --> 01:20:56.181
No. Ew, it's not over,
I won't concede defeat.

01:20:56.183 --> 01:20:59.284
I still possess Sauce power.

01:20:59.286 --> 01:21:03.288
Oh, no. Boo Boo, I think we're
being sucked into the wormhole.

01:21:03.290 --> 01:21:06.290
What? Er, uh, um... Why?

01:21:06.292 --> 01:21:08.593
Well, I was trying
to act as the villain-in-chief,

01:21:08.595 --> 01:21:11.530
uh, since you were occupied with
your, your guest, eh, eh.

01:21:11.532 --> 01:21:14.499
Initiated a laser battle with
the Sparkle Express and then...

01:21:14.501 --> 01:21:16.435
The Sparkle Express?

01:21:16.437 --> 01:21:18.270
Ugh. They're here?

01:21:18.272 --> 01:21:20.539
Yes, Boo Boo,
but it seems as if the battle

01:21:20.541 --> 01:21:22.641
with the Sparkle Express
caused the Gouda

01:21:22.643 --> 01:21:24.776
to lose its trajectory,
and now we're spinning

01:21:24.778 --> 01:21:26.645
out of control
towards the wormhole.

01:21:26.647 --> 01:21:29.347
Wormholes erase everything,
Boo Boo.

01:21:29.349 --> 01:21:31.549
It's back to square one for you.

01:21:31.551 --> 01:21:33.317
And you too.

01:21:33.319 --> 01:21:37.823
It's too late to escape,
you're going down with us.

01:21:37.825 --> 01:21:43.328
That's where you're wrong. I was never here
to begin with, you're talking to a hologram.

01:21:43.330 --> 01:21:44.862
- What?
- Yup.

01:21:44.864 --> 01:21:50.802
No!

01:21:50.804 --> 01:21:52.570
I wanna thank you two for fighting

01:21:52.572 --> 01:21:54.705
so hard to defend the Zooverse.

01:21:54.707 --> 01:21:58.310
The Nice Side is truly honored
to have you in its service.

01:21:58.312 --> 01:22:00.512
Ah, uh, oh, shucks.

01:22:00.514 --> 01:22:02.313
Uh-huh, thanks, Princess.

01:22:02.315 --> 01:22:06.317
I'm not heroic,
I'm just programmed in that way.

01:22:06.319 --> 01:22:10.289
Humble as always, B-52.
Don't ever change.

01:22:10.291 --> 01:22:15.326
It's not possible, Princess,
my motherboard is fixed on hero.

01:22:15.328 --> 01:22:16.661
Well, that's good to know.

01:22:30.277 --> 01:22:31.642
Where are we, Chubby?

01:22:31.644 --> 01:22:33.244
In the 37th quadrant.

01:22:33.246 --> 01:22:36.214
Just around the Twin-Island
planets, Boo Boo.

01:22:36.216 --> 01:22:40.418
Ooh, aah, he-he.

01:22:40.420 --> 01:22:41.619
Oh, goodie.

01:22:41.621 --> 01:22:44.789
I need a vacation.

01:22:44.791 --> 01:22:48.860
Chubby, set coordinates
to Twin-Island planets

01:22:48.862 --> 01:22:53.664
and, uh, book me a suite
at the Six Space Seasons.

01:22:53.666 --> 01:22:58.669
Right away, Boo Boo. Uh, what about
evil, Boo Boo? Got any new plans?

01:22:58.671 --> 01:23:00.638
Nah.

01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:04.642
Let somebody else take on
evil duty for a while.

01:23:06.613 --> 01:23:08.780
Oh, I need a massage.

01:23:08.782 --> 01:23:14.319
<i>So, the Nice Side
reigns victorious,</i>

01:23:14.321 --> 01:23:18.789
<i>and the Mice Side
is vanquished, eh?</i>

01:23:18.791 --> 01:23:23.794
<i>And those fools
actually think peace will last,</i>

01:23:23.796 --> 01:23:29.236
<i>but they've forgotten
all about me.</i>

01:23:30.537 --> 01:23:33.871
<i>They thought it was bad before,</i>

01:23:33.873 --> 01:23:39.610
<i>well, wait till they get
a load of fl...</i>

01:23:39.612 --> 01:23:42.047
<i>Chewflies!</i>
