Squish! Cyd gets
whipped cream in the face.

00:16.937 --> 00:18.269
Whoa, that is not
whipped cream.

00:18.269 --> 00:20.231
I was concerned
you'd enjoy that too much,

00:20.231 --> 00:23.774
so I changed it
to cottage cheese.

00:23.774 --> 00:26.317
Don't worry, Cyd.
I know what you
call cottage cheese,

00:26.317 --> 00:30.030
and there's no way
I'm letting you take
a face-full of "curd turds."

Aw, Shelbs,
you know me so well.

Meatballs.

00:42.163 --> 00:43.294
Correct.

00:43.294 --> 00:45.005
What is Cyd's
favorite book?
 Coloring.

00:45.005 --> 00:47.588
Correct! Cyd thinks
blank is the funniest.

00:47.588 --> 00:50.381
Chickens wearing glasses!

00:50.381 --> 00:53.804

Yes! We're gonna
mop the floor with you guys.

00:56.387 --> 00:58.349
Why did we agree
to play this with them?

00:58.349 --> 01:00.060
I mean,
friendship is literally

01:00.060 --> 01:01.312
the one thing
they're good at.

01:01.312 --> 01:02.683

What is Barry's
favorite sandwich?

01:09.360 --> 01:11.822
Hmm, I saw him eating
a turkey club once,

01:11.822 --> 01:13.364
but he said
it was too dry.

01:13.364 --> 01:14.495
Clock's ticking, Renaldo.

01:14.495 --> 01:15.996
And then there was this time
he had a French dip,

01:15.996 --> 01:17.328
but that was too wet.

01:17.328 --> 01:20.040
Don't need all the sandwiches,
just my favorite.

01:20.040 --> 01:22.333
Which is why I can say
with complete certainty,

01:22.333 --> 01:24.255
Barry's favorite
sandwich is...
 (TIMER BUZZES)

favorite concert?

Easy. First grade,
elementary school auditorium,

02:39.700 --> 02:41.492
Dirk Puddles and
the Rainy Day Gang.

02:42.243 --> 02:43.334
Incorrect.

What?

02:44.625 --> 02:46.377
But you loved that show!
We got to sing backup

02:46.377 --> 02:48.419
on Trackin' Mud through
 Mama's Kitchen.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.383
Cyd, my favorite concert
was Adele.

02:52.383 --> 02:54.054
But we didn't go to Adele.

02:54.054 --> 02:56.347
We had tickets,
but you got sick.

02:56.347 --> 02:59.430
I know, but you stayed home
and took care of me.

02:59.430 --> 03:00.931
That's why it's
my favorite concert,

03:00.931 --> 03:02.563
even though neither of us
got to go.

03:02.563 --> 03:03.724
Cyd got to go.

03:03.724 --> 03:04.895
Naldo, no, I didn't.

03:04.895 --> 03:06.807
I stayed home
with Shelby, remember?

03:06.807 --> 03:09.650
Right. Until she fell asleep.

03:09.650 --> 03:11.362
Then you called me and
asked me if I wanted to go.

03:13.524 --> 03:15.195
You went to that
concert without me?

03:15.195 --> 03:16.447
Look, no...

03:16.447 --> 03:18.449
Renaldo, do you realize
what this means?

03:18.449 --> 03:21.201
That me and Shelby have
the same favorite concert?

03:21.201 --> 03:24.455
No, Cyd stopped
the buzzer before
the official end of play.

We'd love to, Neil,
but our Ranger Badge Master

04:09.920 --> 04:11.632
is gonna be here
in a few hours

04:11.632 --> 04:13.504
and if we don't earn
our camping badge,

04:13.504 --> 04:15.045
he said he's gonna
kick us out.

04:15.045 --> 04:17.087
He's a real
badge-buster.

04:18.969 --> 04:21.512

We just have
to pitch a tent,

we beat Cyd and Shelby
at a friendship game.

05:05.726 --> 05:08.559
I can. I always knew
we were good friends.

05:08.559 --> 05:11.432
Well, we always hypothesized
we were good friends.

05:11.432 --> 05:12.773
The only way
to truly prove it

05:12.773 --> 05:14.274
was to perform
an experiment...

05:19.570 --> 05:21.442
We are the better
best friends.

05:21.442 --> 05:24.495
That's a lot of science to get
from a game with
two chimpanzees on the box.

05:26.156 --> 05:28.539
Renaldo, we must
celebrate our victory.

05:28.539 --> 05:29.790

chocolates?

a cruise ship?

05:39.420 --> 05:40.511
No, I got your favorite.

05:41.422 --> 05:43.093
Plain crackers.

05:43.093 --> 05:46.136
That's weird.
I thought I hated
plain crackers.

05:46.136 --> 05:48.809
Uh, Renaldo,
as your scientifically-proven
best friend,

05:48.809 --> 05:51.021
I'm pretty sure I know
what your favorite snack is.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.857
Barry, I think
these are stale.

05:58.569 --> 05:59.860
Yep!
Just the way you like them.

06:07.197 --> 06:09.700
Shelby, I'm sorry.

I didn't mean for you
to find out that way.

 Mmm-hmm.

06:15.335 --> 06:17.798
Do you want
to talk about it?
 Hmm-mmm.

06:17.798 --> 06:20.340
You sure?
'Cause you seem
like you're mad.

06:20.340 --> 06:23.053
You haven't used anything
but the letter "M"
since we left Barry's.

06:23.053 --> 06:24.054
Oh.

06:25.345 --> 06:27.137

but I completely understand.

06:33.604 --> 06:35.936
You do?
 Of course. I was sick.

06:35.936 --> 06:37.608
You were.
You were so sick.

Okay, good.
I'm glad we can put that
all behind us.

when you get upset, you bake.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.462
True, but this is not
one of those times.

07:01.462 --> 07:04.344

07:06.096 --> 07:08.929
that I very well
may find very upsetting.

07:08.929 --> 07:12.182

there's a dozen

It's the nutmeg.

07:49.890 --> 07:51.261
I can't take this anymore.

07:51.261 --> 07:52.973
I know, these things
are disgusting.

07:54.725 --> 07:57.558
Shelby, admit it,
you're mad at me.

07:57.558 --> 08:01.361
Fine, yes.
I'm mad that you went to
that concert without me!

08:01.361 --> 08:03.564
Okay, how can I fix this?
I just want to
make this right.

08:05.025 --> 08:06.867
I got it!
We'll just jump back

08:06.867 --> 08:08.819
and go to
the concert together!

08:08.819 --> 08:12.823
I guess if I went with you,
I couldn't be mad at you
for going without me.

08:12.823 --> 08:16.456
Yes! Shelby, you are so smart.
And a good baker, normally,
not today.

08:17.918 --> 08:18.959

08:22.673 --> 08:24.675
I'll grab the tickets,
you grab your dancing shoes.

08:27.467 --> 08:29.129
I think we have a problem.

08:29.129 --> 08:31.592
Problem? What are you
talking about... Whoa!

08:32.763 --> 08:35.184
I feel awful.
 No, you're fine!

08:35.184 --> 08:37.267
I don't feel fine.

08:37.267 --> 08:40.309
It's all in your head.
We just gotta get you up
on your feet, get you moving.

08:42.643 --> 08:43.563
Cyd, I'm goin' down!

08:45.485 --> 08:47.317
It's okay, Shelbs.
I'll be your legs.

We're doin' this!
It's going to work!

08:53.073 --> 08:54.655
Next stop, Adele!

08:58.328 --> 09:00.120
Is there any way
Adele could come to us?

09:02.422 --> 09:04.965
Cyd, this isn't gonna work.

09:04.965 --> 09:08.008
I feel terrible.
Let's just jump back.

09:08.008 --> 09:10.841
No, we can do this.

09:10.841 --> 09:15.766
Hey, Cyd. I got your text.
That's so cool of Shelby
to insist I take her ticket.

09:15.766 --> 09:17.017
She's a really good friend.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.061
On second thought,
yeah, let's jump back.

09:23.894 --> 09:25.395
I'm guessing
that made you more mad,

09:25.395 --> 09:26.857
but I don't want
to tell you how you feel.

09:28.649 --> 09:31.241
You told Naldo that
I wanted you to go without me?

09:31.241 --> 09:35.035
No! He assumed it.
I just didn't correct him.

09:36.196 --> 09:37.698
I can't believe this.

09:37.698 --> 09:38.829
Shelby...

09:44.755 --> 09:45.916
Ow!
 Ow!

09:45.916 --> 09:47.127
Ow!
 Ow!

09:47.127 --> 09:48.629
Ow!

09:48.629 --> 09:50.050
I don't even remember
why we're fighting, Chet.

09:50.050 --> 09:53.053
Me either.
Oh, wait.
I remember.

09:53.053 --> 09:54.304
Ow!

09:56.717 --> 09:57.928
BRET AND CHET: Whoa.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.891
You were missing
some tent poles,

10:00.891 --> 10:02.392
so I carved new ones
out of branches.

10:02.392 --> 10:04.224
Cool! We got the tent up!

10:06.106 --> 10:08.568
Now we can
start building a fire.

10:08.568 --> 10:11.361
It says here we need
adult supervision.

10:11.361 --> 10:13.994
Dad, we're
gonna build a fire!

10:13.994 --> 10:15.285
(KNOCKING ON WINDOW)

10:15.285 --> 10:17.157
Wow, that got him
to the window quick.

10:18.739 --> 10:20.791
Now it says here
we need
a flint and steel.

10:24.915 --> 10:27.878
Okay, hand me the steel.
No, you hand me the flint.

10:27.878 --> 10:29.629
Why don't you
just flip a coin?

10:29.629 --> 10:34.344
Neil, that's a great idea.
I'll be heads.
 No, I'll be heads!

10:34.344 --> 10:36.927
Let's wrestle for it!
Winner builds the fire?

10:36.927 --> 10:38.719
No! Winner gets to be heads!

10:44.354 --> 10:47.027
We jumped back
so we could go to
that concert together,

10:47.027 --> 10:48.438
but it just
made things worse.

10:48.438 --> 10:50.320
Well, it was only
a matter of time
before you guys were

10:50.320 --> 10:52.272
no longer the best
best friends.

10:52.272 --> 10:54.114
I mean,
you did lose Squish.

10:54.114 --> 10:56.737
Cydby has been
replaced by Barnaldo.

10:59.279 --> 11:01.782
I'm sorry to rub
our friendship
in your face, Shelby.

11:01.782 --> 11:04.875
It must sting to see
two people
this on the same page.

11:06.997 --> 11:08.418
What are you
going to do?

11:08.418 --> 11:10.250
I've never seen you
this mad at Cyd before.

11:10.250 --> 11:13.503
I've never been this mad
at Cyd before.

11:13.503 --> 11:16.296
Shelby, I got it!
I know how to make
this up to you.

11:16.296 --> 11:18.098
I had a good time
at a concert without you.

11:18.098 --> 11:20.931
So you have to
have a good time
at a concert without me.

11:20.931 --> 11:22.803
Then we'll be even
and you won't be mad.

11:22.803 --> 11:24.725
That is the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

11:24.725 --> 11:26.566
Hey! You can't
talk to her like that!

11:26.566 --> 11:27.938
He is right, though,
it does sound like

11:27.938 --> 11:30.811
you haven't really
thought this through.

11:30.811 --> 11:33.864
I've got two tickets
to the Battle of the Boy Bands
at the mall tonight,

11:33.864 --> 11:35.075
and you're going
with Naldo.

11:35.075 --> 11:37.157
(GASPS)
 Hee-hee!

11:37.157 --> 11:38.739
I mean... (GASPS)

11:40.660 --> 11:42.412
I don't know...

11:42.412 --> 11:44.534
Please, Shelby,
it's the only idea
I've got left.

11:44.534 --> 11:45.956
You go and have fun,

11:45.956 --> 11:47.878
and I'll stay here
and be miserable.

11:47.878 --> 11:50.210
But how can you possibly
guarantee her
that you'll be miserable?

11:50.210 --> 11:51.541
I'll be with you.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.295
Naldo, what do you think?
Do you want to go?

11:55.295 --> 11:56.837
Allow me
to answer for him.

11:56.837 --> 11:59.049
Not a chance.
Renaldo hates crowds.

11:59.049 --> 12:01.261
I totally agree
with everything Barry said,

12:01.261 --> 12:03.643
except yes, I'll go
and I love crowds.

12:04.845 --> 12:07.187
Then, I guess
we better get going.

12:12.152 --> 12:13.613
BOTH: Heads.

12:14.985 --> 12:16.196
BOTH: Heads.

12:17.908 --> 12:20.530
Am I dreaming,
or do you smell hot dogs?

12:20.530 --> 12:22.072
I'm the wrong guy to ask.

12:22.072 --> 12:23.824
All my dreams
smell like hot dogs.

12:26.867 --> 12:29.920
Well, guys, the tent's up,
the fire's burning

12:29.920 --> 12:31.922
and the hot dogs are cooking.

12:31.922 --> 12:34.134
You're gonna get your
camping badges for sure.

12:34.134 --> 12:36.046
Great job, Neil.
 Thanks.

12:36.046 --> 12:39.049
Only one problem.
We were supposed
to do it!

12:39.049 --> 12:41.972
But you guys were fighting.
 That's our process.

12:43.763 --> 12:47.978
This is too good.
The Badge Master will never
believe we did any of it.

12:47.978 --> 12:50.480
I guess I could drop
the hot dogs in the dirt.

12:50.480 --> 12:53.153
Or I could make the tent
a little lopsided.

12:53.153 --> 12:55.275
Or I could
let the fire go out.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.277
I'm hearing
a lot of "coulds,"

12:57.277 --> 12:58.989
but I'm not seeing
a lot of "dids."

13:06.616 --> 13:08.999
Shelby and I are
definitely gonna be
even after this.

13:08.999 --> 13:12.913
Naldo's so much fun
to go to concerts with.
That guy loves to dance.

13:12.913 --> 13:16.126
Loves to dance?
Are we talking about
the same Renaldo?

13:16.126 --> 13:17.297
Blonde hair?
 Brown.

13:17.297 --> 13:18.418
Blue eyes.
 Green.

13:18.418 --> 13:19.549
About this tall?

13:21.551 --> 13:23.924
Do you know anything
about Naldo?
 Of course, I do.

13:23.924 --> 13:26.136
We won
 Squish! The Friendship Game.

13:26.136 --> 13:28.018
I know everything
there is to know about him.

13:28.929 --> 13:31.932
Things I know
about Renaldo.

13:31.932 --> 13:33.693
Ah-ha!

13:36.316 --> 13:37.317
Hat.

13:38.488 --> 13:39.940
Unless...

13:41.942 --> 13:43.703
You were right
the first time.
 Shuds!

13:45.996 --> 13:49.159
I texted Shelby and asked her
if she got to the concert
like 10 minutes ago.

13:49.159 --> 13:51.121
Why isn't she texting me back?

13:51.121 --> 13:53.123
Maybe she's too busy
having a great time?

13:53.123 --> 13:55.956
Or maybe she's icing me out
because she's having
a terrible time.

13:55.956 --> 13:57.757
Oh, I got the dots,
she's texting!

13:57.757 --> 14:00.220
(PHONE CHIMING)
 "Yes."

14:00.220 --> 14:02.172
Is that a happy yes?
Sad yes?

14:02.172 --> 14:04.174
I forgive you and we'll share
a bedroom forever yes?

14:04.174 --> 14:05.175
What is she saying?

14:07.427 --> 14:09.099
I need you to ask me
questions about Renaldo.

14:09.099 --> 14:10.600
But what if Shelby...
 Just do it!

14:10.600 --> 14:11.932
It will take your mind
off your dumb problem.

14:15.145 --> 14:16.686
What's Naldo's
favorite color?

14:16.686 --> 14:17.938
Pass.

14:17.938 --> 14:19.859
Favorite animal?
 Pass.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.071
Favorite place
on Earth?

14:21.071 --> 14:22.482
Ooh, hard pass!

14:23.743 --> 14:25.445
I don't know anything
about Renaldo!

14:26.987 --> 14:29.079
Am I really that
bad of a friend?

14:29.079 --> 14:32.702
What are you asking me for?
I betrayed Shelby
in two separate timelines.

14:32.702 --> 14:34.584
We don't deserve them.

14:34.584 --> 14:37.047
I guess we'll just have
to become best friends
with each other now.

14:37.047 --> 14:38.919
I cannot let that happen!

14:38.919 --> 14:40.000
I'm gonna go down
to the mall

14:40.000 --> 14:42.002
and make sure
she's having a good time.

14:42.002 --> 14:44.094
Isn't the whole point
that she has a good time
and you don't?

14:44.094 --> 14:46.676
Ah! But I'm not gonna
have a good time.

14:46.676 --> 14:48.058
You're coming with me.

14:48.058 --> 14:49.930
Oh, but I hate crowds.

14:49.930 --> 14:51.511
Yes, that's perfect,
more whining.

14:51.511 --> 14:53.603
(GROANS)
You're hurting my arm!

15:04.324 --> 15:08.118
Maybe Cyd's right.
Maybe coming to
Battle of the Boy Bands

15:08.118 --> 15:09.739
will fix things between us.

15:09.739 --> 15:10.951
I gotta give it a shot,
right, Naldo?

15:12.492 --> 15:13.663
What are you wearing?

15:16.456 --> 15:19.709
I was at the merch table,
but I didn't know
which boy band to support.

15:19.709 --> 15:23.253
Am I rooting for
What About JoJo
or Five-Ever?

15:23.253 --> 15:25.635
And then I saw this sweet hat
from True Dudes

15:25.635 --> 15:28.178
and pants featuring four
of the five members
of Yeah Girl.

15:30.640 --> 15:33.223
If they win this thing,
Wyatt's gonna be so mad
he quit.

15:38.858 --> 15:40.110
Barry!

15:42.983 --> 15:46.616
This outfit is ridiculous.
How is this supposed
to get us past security?

15:46.616 --> 15:47.907
Just follow my lead.

15:47.907 --> 15:49.159
Here are our tickets.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.032
You got tickets online?

15:52.032 --> 15:53.373
Then why am I
dressed like this?

15:53.373 --> 15:56.166
It's been a rough day, Barry.
I needed a laugh.

15:56.166 --> 15:58.038
Now, come on.
We gotta go find
Shelby and Naldo.

16:00.250 --> 16:01.291
There they are!

16:02.582 --> 16:04.214
I'm gonna go sneak over
behind that poster

16:04.214 --> 16:05.845
and try to hear
if she's having
a good time.

16:05.845 --> 16:07.297
What? No. Don't leave me!
People are gonna think

16:07.297 --> 16:09.299
I came here
'cause I wanted to!

16:12.762 --> 16:15.645
This is pretty great.
I'm here with a good friend,

16:15.645 --> 16:19.149
we've got prime spots,
the mall has free Wi-Fi.

16:19.149 --> 16:20.650
This will solve everything.

16:22.312 --> 16:24.904
I don't know.
Something doesn't
feel right.

16:24.904 --> 16:27.067
I know.
I feel it too.

16:27.067 --> 16:28.908
I think it's this
Five-Ever underwear.

16:28.908 --> 16:30.910
Is Chad supposed to be
on the front or the back?

16:33.113 --> 16:36.076
I don't get it.
Why can't I let this go?

16:36.076 --> 16:37.957
You and Cyd have had
arguments before.

16:37.957 --> 16:39.579
What's different
about this?

16:39.579 --> 16:41.751
I don't know.
I thought I was mad

16:41.751 --> 16:44.294
'cause she went
to that concert,

16:44.294 --> 16:47.087
but now that I think about it,
I'm glad she went.

16:47.087 --> 16:49.799
I wouldn't want Cyd to
miss out on a good time.

16:49.799 --> 16:51.801
Oh, she didn't.
She had the best time.

16:51.801 --> 16:53.303
We were in the front row

16:53.303 --> 16:54.974
and then we got
backstage passes...
 Okay, okay!

16:54.974 --> 16:56.096
She had a great time,
I get it.

16:58.268 --> 17:01.101
Well, if it's not the concert,
then what are you mad about?

17:02.142 --> 17:05.565
I guess I'm mad
that she lied about it.

17:05.565 --> 17:08.647
For the first time,
I feel like
I can't trust her.

17:08.647 --> 17:11.241
Shelby, it's Cyd.
You know you can
trust her.

17:16.156 --> 17:17.827
But I've been wrong before.

17:19.959 --> 17:21.461
Cyd, what are you doing here?

17:21.461 --> 17:23.083
I can explain!

17:23.083 --> 17:25.214
I was eavesdropping
and I thought the poster
would hold my weight.

17:27.297 --> 17:30.880
That's your explanation?
You thought you wouldn't
get caught?

17:32.302 --> 17:34.594
(STAMMERS) This is
why I can't let it go.

17:34.594 --> 17:37.016
It's not about
the concert at all.

17:37.016 --> 17:40.350
It's about the fact
that you never even
told me that you went.

17:40.350 --> 17:42.982
You've been lying to me.

17:42.982 --> 17:47.187
This whole time
I thought I was mad,
but I'm not.

17:47.187 --> 17:48.648
I'm hurt.

17:49.949 --> 17:51.241
But Shelby...

17:51.241 --> 17:52.492
I can't talk
to you right now.

17:52.492 --> 17:54.244
Shelby, wait!

17:57.537 --> 17:59.539
Barry?
 Renaldo?

17:59.539 --> 18:01.371
BOTH: You look ridiculous!

18:02.752 --> 18:04.704
What are you doing here?

18:04.704 --> 18:07.207
You don't like
this kind of music.
And you hate crowds.

18:07.207 --> 18:11.050
You know me so well,
and yet I don't know
a thing about you.

18:11.050 --> 18:13.263
Like what is
your favorite color?
 Pass.

18:13.263 --> 18:14.634
Well, that's
what I said.

18:14.634 --> 18:16.216
What is your favorite animal?
 Pass.

18:16.216 --> 18:17.637
I said that too.

18:17.637 --> 18:19.098
What's your favorite
place on Earth?

18:19.098 --> 18:20.640
Hmm. I want to say the lab...

18:20.640 --> 18:22.682
No.
 ...but I'm gonna go
with hard pass.

18:22.682 --> 18:25.185
Yes!

18:25.185 --> 18:27.277
How can I pick a favorite
when I haven't been
to all the places

18:27.277 --> 18:30.069
or met all the animals
or seen all the colors?

18:30.069 --> 18:31.731
Does it get better
than orange?
I don't know!

18:33.323 --> 18:35.785
Classic Renaldo.
I do know you.

18:35.785 --> 18:38.238
Of course, you know me.
We're bros for life.

18:38.238 --> 18:39.449
Bros for life.

18:39.449 --> 18:42.041
Wait. Did you just say
you're Bros for Life?

18:42.041 --> 18:43.042
We sure did.

18:43.042 --> 18:45.415
Well, you gotta get on stage!
The rest of your group is
already up there!

18:54.424 --> 18:57.967
We're finally gonna do it.
We're gonna get
our camping badges, Bret.

18:57.967 --> 19:02.061
All we have to do is not
let the Badge Master know
that Neil did everything.

19:06.356 --> 19:08.978
Why'd he do that?
 I feel like
he's judging us.

19:10.940 --> 19:12.272
Proud of you, guys.

19:12.272 --> 19:15.445
Why's he proud of us?
He knows
we didn't do anything.

19:21.201 --> 19:23.663
Yay, Bret!
Yay, Chet!

19:23.663 --> 19:25.495
(WHOOPING)

19:25.495 --> 19:30.750
I can't take it anymore!
 Don't you flip on me, Bret!
I need this!

19:32.462 --> 19:34.344
I can't!
It's too much!

19:34.344 --> 19:37.217
Badge Master, sir,
I didn't do any of this.
It was all...

19:37.217 --> 19:40.059
Me! It was all me!
I did it, sir.

19:40.059 --> 19:44.183
No, he didn't.
It was all Neil.
Neil did everything.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.605
I guess you should
just kick us out.

19:45.605 --> 19:47.607
We're not Ranger
Badge Buddy material.
 (GRUNTING)

19:49.809 --> 19:53.483
Wow, I can't believe
they made me
a Ranger Badge Buddy.

19:53.483 --> 19:56.986
And I got a camping badge.
 I got an honesty badge.

19:56.986 --> 19:59.659
I got kicked out
for lying to
a Badge Master!

19:59.659 --> 20:01.661
And they gave
Neil my shirt!

20:04.284 --> 20:06.416
I guess we gotta take
this campsite down.

20:06.416 --> 20:08.628
Come on, guys.

20:08.628 --> 20:13.253
Hey, I'd totally help,
but since I'm not
a Ranger Badge Buddy,

20:13.253 --> 20:16.636
I'll be at the movies.
Have fun cleaning up, chumps.

20:19.599 --> 20:21.391
Neil, I know
this sounds weird,

20:21.391 --> 20:24.183
but I think
Chet outsmarted us.

20:24.183 --> 20:25.345
I thought you were Chet.

20:35.485 --> 20:36.486
Hey.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.238
Hey.

20:42.492 --> 20:45.785
Shelby, you were right.
I should have told you
that I went to that concert.

20:45.785 --> 20:47.667
I thought I could fix it,
but I can't.

20:48.918 --> 20:50.790
I'm so sorry for hurting you.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.876
Why didn't you tell me?

20:59.469 --> 21:02.091
At first, I was afraid
you'd be mad that I went.

21:03.643 --> 21:07.307
Then I was afraid
you'd be mad that I lied.

21:07.307 --> 21:12.271
And now I'm just afraid
you'll never forgive me.

21:14.063 --> 21:17.857
Cyd, of course,
I'm going to forgive you.

21:18.488 --> 21:20.279
Really?

21:20.279 --> 21:23.743
Yes, we're best friends.

21:23.743 --> 21:28.498
But I think
maybe it's gonna
take some time.

21:28.498 --> 21:31.250
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

21:31.621 --> 21:32.752
(CHUCKLES)

21:39.339 --> 21:42.382
I'm so glad everything's
gonna be okay.

21:42.382 --> 21:44.303
I almost had to
become best friends
with Barry.

21:45.845 --> 21:47.387
I would never
let that happen.

21:49.929 --> 21:53.643
Guys, guess who came
in eighth at the Battle
of the Boy Bands!

21:53.643 --> 21:54.854
BOTH: Bros for Life!

21:58.398 --> 22:00.650
Shelbs, I'm don't mean to
rush the healing process,

22:00.650 --> 22:02.281
but we're gonna jump back
and see that, right?

22:02.281 --> 22:04.444
Definitely. I need
a new favorite concert.

22:07.156 --> 22:08.498
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

22:08.498 --> 22:10.790
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together!

22:10.790 --> 22:12.952
It's Bros for Life!

22:12.952 --> 22:14.374
(ALL CHEERING)

22:14.374 --> 22:15.955
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

22:33.062 --> 22:36.526
You gotta step it up, Barry.
This is what happens
when you miss rehearsal.

22:36.526 --> 22:38.478
Renaldo,
we are not in this band!

22:47.246 --> 22:51.040
Wow, Naldo is really good,
and Barry's...

22:52.702 --> 22:54.043
Also our friend.

22:58.498 --> 22:59.839
(CROWD CHEERING)
