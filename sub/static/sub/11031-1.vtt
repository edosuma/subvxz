00:28.243 --> 00:30.143
Hey, Jeffrey. How are you?

00:30.312 --> 00:32.302
Hey, Jeffrey.

00:42.658 --> 00:44.125
Will you excuse me?

00:48.230 --> 00:50.460
That looks like a powerful scope.

00:50.866 --> 00:52.493
It was my dad's.

00:53.769 --> 00:57.170
I can't tell you how many times
I found your dad right here...

00:57.339 --> 01:01.366
...right here, sitting there
looking through that thing.

01:03.679 --> 01:05.772
Seymour...

01:05.948 --> 01:07.779
...if I can lose my dad...

01:07.950 --> 01:11.818
...then what's to say
I can't lose my mom too?

01:13.989 --> 01:17.481
I don't know why
this thing happened, kid...

01:17.693 --> 01:19.888
...but I do know your father loved you.

01:20.362 --> 01:24.856
And I'm sure he's up there
right now watching out for you.

01:27.569 --> 01:29.730
You do right by him, Jeffrey.

01:30.305 --> 01:32.637
You look after your mother...

01:32.808 --> 01:36.175
...and you become a man
that he would be proud of.

01:38.013 --> 01:40.413
-What happened? Are you all right?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

01:40.582 --> 01:43.312
Don't worry, you've got plenty of time.
You'll get there.

01:55.531 --> 01:56.555
Bye, honey!

02:01.436 --> 02:03.768
Hey, where you going?

02:03.939 --> 02:05.304
Kiss your mom goodbye?

02:13.482 --> 02:14.847
Oh!

02:20.322 --> 02:21.311
Ooh.

02:23.659 --> 02:24.853
What a loser.

02:36.138 --> 02:37.833
What do you call that?

02:44.313 --> 02:46.474
Oh, my God.

03:09.404 --> 03:10.666
Oh.

03:13.208 --> 03:15.039
Jeffrey?

03:15.777 --> 03:17.574
-Jeffrey?
What do you want?

03:17.746 --> 03:20.772
It's Jean-Paul. Something's wrong.

03:20.949 --> 03:23.417
It's just like he's, you know,
like not normal.

03:23.585 --> 03:25.553
Just not normal.

03:26.755 --> 03:28.950
For the love of Mike, what happened?

03:29.124 --> 03:31.490
He was just like this when I found.... Oh....

03:31.660 --> 03:34.060
There you go, Jean-Paul.
It's gonna be okay.

03:34.229 --> 03:37.289
Sure it is, sure it is, yeah.

03:38.400 --> 03:39.662
Oh.

03:40.769 --> 03:43.636
-No.
-Oh, Jeffrey. Oh, Jeffrey.

03:43.805 --> 03:47.297
Oh, sweetie. Don't-- Jeffrey.

03:47.809 --> 03:49.037
Oh.

03:49.745 --> 03:52.043
That's nice for Jean-Paul.

03:55.550 --> 03:59.748
Well, oh, dear. Tsk. Bye-bye.

03:59.922 --> 04:02.117
Let's go, sweetie.

04:02.291 --> 04:05.419
Sometimes it takes a great tragedy...

04:05.594 --> 04:08.062
...to make a man see his life clearly.

04:09.932 --> 04:13.766
I realize in my 29 years on this planet...

04:13.936 --> 04:18.373
...I haven't told you often enough
how much I appreciate you.

04:18.540 --> 04:24.775
But you are all I have left
in this cruel world.

04:25.347 --> 04:29.579
And I'm not going to let anything
come between us.

04:29.751 --> 04:31.742
-Oh....
-Ever.

04:32.621 --> 04:36.182
-I love you.
-I love you too.

04:37.426 --> 04:39.587
Thank you, sweetie, love you.

04:39.761 --> 04:42.855
But you know what, honey?
We really have to get going, we're late.

04:43.198 --> 04:44.825
I can see that my time is almost up.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.468
So I want to share with you
one final story.

04:47.636 --> 04:51.800
On a beautiful morning in 1998...

04:51.974 --> 04:55.000
...I went to my doctor
for a routine colonoscopy.

04:55.177 --> 04:59.307
He ran some tests to make sure
I didn't have cancer...

04:59.481 --> 05:01.039
...but I did.

05:03.218 --> 05:06.210
I tried every treatment
known to Western medicine...

05:10.859 --> 05:14.727
...and some unknown
to Western medicine.

05:18.233 --> 05:20.292
Whoo! Ha-ha-ha.

05:21.636 --> 05:23.763
Nothing worked.

05:24.473 --> 05:27.306
I was told I was....

05:27.909 --> 05:31.777
I was told I was going to die
in six months.

05:32.914 --> 05:35.781
That was six years ago.

05:35.951 --> 05:38.476
I beat cancer.

05:39.921 --> 05:41.582
How?

05:41.757 --> 05:43.281
With my mind.

05:43.458 --> 05:46.791
I decided I was not gonna let
some overactive clump of cells...

05:46.962 --> 05:49.226
...stop me from living my life.

05:49.398 --> 05:54.563
From that moment on, I realized
I could have anything my heart desired.

05:54.736 --> 05:56.203
You can too.

05:56.371 --> 06:00.569
Remember, you are the author
of your own life story.

06:00.742 --> 06:04.473
Why not make it a happy ending?
Thank you.

06:08.183 --> 06:09.707
Oh.

06:16.124 --> 06:18.718
<i>One, two, three, four!</i>

06:35.077 --> 06:38.444
-Son-of-a--
-Good morning, Jeffrey.

06:38.613 --> 06:42.344
That's Mr. Mannus to you,
and there's nothing good about it.

06:42.517 --> 06:44.212
Jeffrey...

06:45.454 --> 06:47.979
...did you change the window display?

06:49.925 --> 06:52.052
Sex sells, Seymour.

06:52.227 --> 06:54.889
Change it back, now!

06:55.063 --> 06:57.429
I'm putting Keith in charge
of window displays.

06:57.599 --> 07:00.363
-What?
-I need someone I can count on.

07:00.535 --> 07:03.629
Seymour, how long
have I been employed here?

07:03.805 --> 07:05.067
Thirteen years.

07:05.240 --> 07:08.403
Yeah. And in all that time,
have I ever missed a day of work?

07:08.577 --> 07:12.775
Yes. More than any employee I ever had.

07:12.948 --> 07:15.576
There was the day your ant farm broke...

07:15.750 --> 07:19.686
...the day you lost your hat,
the day you had a sore tongue.

07:19.855 --> 07:22.585
I can't do my job if I can't enunciate.

07:22.757 --> 07:24.884
Jeffrey, I like you.

07:25.060 --> 07:27.722
I liked your father,
he was a good friend...

07:27.896 --> 07:30.057
...and a great Rotarian.

07:30.232 --> 07:33.759
But I need you to start
taking this job seriously.

07:34.769 --> 07:38.398
Just behave or you're fired.

07:38.573 --> 07:40.598
You know, positivity goes back centuries.

07:40.775 --> 07:45.109
I mean, Jesus, Jesus, for crying out loud,
was a motivational speaker.

07:45.280 --> 07:46.907
-I mean, at his core.
-I guess, yeah.

07:47.082 --> 07:48.106
--talk to him.

07:48.283 --> 07:51.218
I haven't done anything like that in years.
What do I say to him?

07:51.386 --> 07:55.618
Just ask him a question. You could
ask him a follow-up about his colon.

07:55.790 --> 07:59.123
This is utterly ridiculous.
I have a lot of work to do. I'm just gonna--

07:59.294 --> 08:01.558
Ask him anything,
because here's the point:

08:01.730 --> 08:04.893
You can't spend
the rest of your Friday nights...

08:05.066 --> 08:07.034
...playing Scrabble with that son of yours.

08:07.202 --> 08:09.727
-I know.
-You gotta dip your toe in the water.

08:09.905 --> 08:12.897
Somehow, some way,
some dipping must occur.

08:13.074 --> 08:15.065
Stop talking about-- Okay, okay.

08:15.243 --> 08:17.643
-Calm down, relax. It'll be easy.
-Okay, I'm mature.

08:17.812 --> 08:20.337
The third world's a region
I'd like to get my hands on.

08:20.515 --> 08:23.006
-They could use some positivity.
-Hi.

08:23.185 --> 08:24.777
-Hi.
-Excuse me, gentlemen.

08:24.953 --> 08:27.444
-H--
-Hi.

08:28.623 --> 08:31.786
I don't want to interrupt anything,
of course, but I was wondering...

08:31.960 --> 08:36.020
-...if it's all right if I ask you a question?
-Sure. Absolutely.

08:38.832 --> 08:41.529
Stem cells, that's what I mean.

08:41.703 --> 08:46.037
It's like, what do you think of the stem-cell
research that's going on today?

08:47.275 --> 08:50.369
I'm no expert, but I think
if it helps the human race, go for it.

08:50.545 --> 08:52.103
Good. Good answer.

08:52.280 --> 08:53.941
Oh. Thank you.

08:54.115 --> 08:56.140
-Jan Mannus, right?
-Me. Yes, I'm Jan.

08:56.318 --> 08:59.845
Associate Director of Human Resources.
You are doing a hell of a job.

09:00.021 --> 09:01.818
Thank you for noticing.

09:01.990 --> 09:04.049
-Hmm.
-Anyway....

09:05.727 --> 09:08.992
-Okay.
-Do you like, uh, jazz?

09:09.164 --> 09:10.188
Yes.

09:10.365 --> 09:11.764
-Do you?
-I love jazz.

09:11.933 --> 09:13.992
You lo--?
Well, I play in a band...

09:14.169 --> 09:18.868
...and we gig on Friday nights
at the Jazz Odyssey.

09:19.040 --> 09:20.268
Yes, I know that place.

09:20.442 --> 09:23.070
Do you? Good.
Would you like to come with me?

09:23.245 --> 09:26.180
I'd love to come with you.
That's the most wonderful invitation.

09:26.348 --> 09:27.838
-Thank you.
-Terrific.

09:28.950 --> 09:32.818
But I'm afraid I can't on Friday night.

09:32.988 --> 09:36.890
-I'm sorry. What did you say?
-I said I can't make it Friday night.

09:37.058 --> 09:38.753
I'm still not understanding you...

09:38.927 --> 09:41.862
...because the word "can't"
isn't in my vocabulary.

09:43.932 --> 09:48.232
You see, Jan, we never regret
the things in life we do...

09:48.403 --> 09:51.566
...only the things we don't.

09:52.407 --> 09:54.466
-I wrote that.
-Ah.

09:55.010 --> 09:56.034
I do.

09:58.213 --> 10:01.080
I do, but you know what I mean,
not like the whole "I do."

10:01.249 --> 10:02.773
I mean, what I'm saying is yes.

10:02.951 --> 10:05.681
I would like to go with you...

10:05.854 --> 10:08.982
...and listen to you play the jazz.

10:13.028 --> 10:15.519
-Hi, sweetheart.
-What are you doing here?

10:15.697 --> 10:17.597
I thought I'd give you a ride home.

10:17.766 --> 10:21.725
Guess who I ran into yesterday?
Jennifer Cushman's mother.

10:21.903 --> 10:24.167
Jennifer Cushman
is apparently getting a divorce.

10:24.339 --> 10:25.772
-Good for her.
-I know.

10:25.940 --> 10:30.343
She'll be at the church's single mixer
on Friday so I thought you might wanna go.

10:30.512 --> 10:32.537
I have plans with you Friday night,
remember?

10:32.714 --> 10:33.976
Oh, right.

10:34.149 --> 10:37.118
Why are you so concerned
about my personal life all of a sudden?

10:37.285 --> 10:40.812
You haven't been on a date in three years,
Jeffrey. I'm concerned about--

10:40.989 --> 10:42.513
Neither have you.

10:42.691 --> 10:44.352
Well, I got asked out today, and....

10:44.526 --> 10:47.495
-Pfft. Please.
-What do you mean, "Please"?

10:47.662 --> 10:50.062
Can you--?
What is wrong with me getting asked out?

10:50.231 --> 10:52.358
-You're a middle-aged widow.
-I'm not that old.

10:52.534 --> 10:54.627
Not some trollop
out of a Jackie Collins novel.

10:54.803 --> 10:57.772
There's no reason to be absolutely ugly
to me in front of people.

10:57.939 --> 11:01.067
I'm trying to protect you. What if
it doesn't work out, like the last one?

11:01.242 --> 11:03.642
I couldn't bear to see you get hurt again.

11:03.812 --> 11:08.340
You know something, we never regret
the things that we actually do in our lives...

11:08.516 --> 11:11.417
...only the things that we don't do. So.

11:11.586 --> 11:14.111
Where did you get
that pseudo-philosophical platitude?

11:14.289 --> 11:16.120
-It doesn't matter.
-Dr. Phil?

11:16.291 --> 11:18.987
Okay, that's not funny.
I think I'm gonna go.

11:19.160 --> 11:21.128
Okay, fine.

11:21.296 --> 11:24.459
So. When is this date?

11:25.133 --> 11:29.035
-Friday night.
-What? That's Putt-Putt night.

11:29.204 --> 11:32.799
But I said I was sorry.
-Well, I'm afraid sorry won't do.

11:32.974 --> 11:35.408
I know, I know, sweetheart.

11:35.577 --> 11:39.775
What if I make your favorite, huh?
What do you think? Little bitty?

11:39.948 --> 11:42.212
No! You can't win back my affection
with Manwich.

11:42.384 --> 11:45.285
This has been the worst day of my life.
I'm going to my room.

12:28.663 --> 12:31.188
Did you do something to your hair?

12:31.366 --> 12:33.129
I cut it.

12:35.503 --> 12:38.995
A little garish,
but not altogether unattractive.

12:39.174 --> 12:42.666
-Really?
-What's the occasion?

12:42.844 --> 12:45.506
Well, I have a date tonight, remember?

12:46.381 --> 12:48.941
Oh, yes, right, of course.

12:49.117 --> 12:52.245
The bitter sting of rejection's
coming back to me now.

12:52.420 --> 12:55.253
Jeffrey. Oh, my goodness, here it is.

12:55.423 --> 12:56.856
Well, have a nice day.

12:57.025 --> 12:59.516
-Aren't you forgetting something?
-What?

12:59.694 --> 13:02.629
It comes in a brown paper sack,
and rhymes with my lunch.

13:02.797 --> 13:04.958
I just didn't have time
to make it this morning.

13:05.133 --> 13:08.660
Why can't you just grab yourself
a little sandwich or something?

13:08.837 --> 13:12.534
All right, honey? Bye-bye, bye-bye.
There you go.

13:30.158 --> 13:32.126
Can I help you?

13:33.862 --> 13:36.956
Yes. Do you have anything
that's not utterly repugnant?

13:37.131 --> 13:38.393
No.

13:40.168 --> 13:41.999
Okay.

13:42.170 --> 13:45.799
Fine, give me three biscottis...

13:45.974 --> 13:48.135
...two chocolate chip fudge brownies...

13:48.309 --> 13:51.039
...and one of these giant
Rice Krispie abominations.

13:51.212 --> 13:53.180
Maybe a heart attack will teach
my mother...

13:53.348 --> 13:56.340
-...a lesson in abandonment.
-Maybe.

13:56.985 --> 13:58.748
Biscotti.

14:01.890 --> 14:03.289
That's a cool store.

14:03.458 --> 14:08.088
It's actually got some character,
unlike those lame mega-chains.

14:08.263 --> 14:09.821
Do you like working there?

14:09.998 --> 14:13.331
It's paying the bills
until I make my first astronomical discovery.

14:13.501 --> 14:17.164
You're an astronomer?
That's cool.

14:17.772 --> 14:21.208
I'm a singer, actually. Well, trying to be.

14:22.110 --> 14:24.044
Most of my songs
that I write are about...

14:24.212 --> 14:27.204
...how corporate America's
totally screwing up our culture.

14:27.382 --> 14:30.146
I'm calling my first album
"Bed, Bath and Bullshit."

14:30.318 --> 14:31.649
So....

14:31.819 --> 14:36.085
I actually do a show here every Saturday.

14:37.025 --> 14:40.290
It's not sappy. You know,
my songs aren't about love or anything.

14:40.461 --> 14:42.395
They're about...

14:42.564 --> 14:45.431
...how much I hate corporations.

14:45.600 --> 14:50.196
So, anyway, that will be 10.76.

14:50.371 --> 14:54.239
For stale bread and cereal?
That's obscene.

14:54.409 --> 14:58.778
I know. The guys who own this place
are a bunch of poser A-holes.

14:58.947 --> 15:04.351
So.... But I'll give you
my employee discount if you want.

15:05.753 --> 15:08.017
It's 10 dollars even.

15:11.659 --> 15:15.026
All right, here you go.

15:15.930 --> 15:18.398
Well, take it easy.

15:29.344 --> 15:30.641
Here.

15:30.812 --> 15:33.076
This is redeemable for a free book.

15:33.247 --> 15:37.308
Not including first editions
or new releases...

15:37.485 --> 15:40.318
-...or fiction.
-Thanks.

15:41.022 --> 15:42.785
Or non-fiction.

15:45.393 --> 15:47.088
It's--

15:49.897 --> 15:51.990
We--

16:09.651 --> 16:10.640
Woo. Oh.

16:17.925 --> 16:22.089
Thank you. Thank you very much
for coming out to the Jazz Odyssey tonight.

16:22.263 --> 16:26.757
For our last song, I'd like to dedicate it
to a very special lady...

16:26.934 --> 16:29.164
-...in the audience tonight.
-Oh--

16:51.526 --> 16:52.686
Do you mind if I say this?

16:52.860 --> 16:55.727
I just can't get over what
a great singer you are. I mean that.

16:55.897 --> 16:58.798
Well, Nat King Cole,
that's a great singer. I'm just a wannabe.

16:58.966 --> 17:00.399
You know something? I disagree.

17:00.568 --> 17:03.662
To me, I think that you could have
your own Christmas special even.

17:03.838 --> 17:08.638
Thank you. That's very kind. Actually,
music is just another hobby for me.

17:08.810 --> 17:12.507
Kind of like golf
and horseback riding and archery.

17:12.714 --> 17:14.375
And wine making.

17:14.549 --> 17:16.039
-Of course, puppetry.
-Oh.

17:16.217 --> 17:20.085
My goodness. I just don't even understand
how you find time for all of it.

17:20.253 --> 17:23.382
I think we always find time
for the things that are important to us.

17:23.558 --> 17:25.185
Don't we? What's important to you?

17:25.358 --> 17:26.416
-Me?
-Yeah.

17:26.594 --> 17:27.788
Oh, my goodness. Well....

17:27.962 --> 17:30.396
Unless I'm being too personal,
because I don't wanna--

17:30.565 --> 17:32.795
No, not at all.
I just haven't thought about...

17:32.967 --> 17:35.629
...what's important to me
in a really long time, so....

17:35.803 --> 17:37.896
Well, maybe it's time you start.

17:38.072 --> 17:39.801
What a wonderful evening I had.

17:39.974 --> 17:42.033
-You are so nice.
-Well, thank you, I did too.

17:42.210 --> 17:44.405
Would you like to maybe do it again?

17:45.446 --> 17:47.505
-You mean go out again?
-Yeah.

17:47.682 --> 17:50.173
I mean, my God, you're beautiful,
you're smart, and....

17:50.351 --> 17:52.615
Plus, you like my singing, so there's that.

17:52.787 --> 17:55.950
Seriously, though,
I think being a single mother...

17:56.124 --> 17:59.355
...is the most noble thing
that anyone could ever do.

17:59.527 --> 18:03.520
It takes strength and fortitude
to raise a well-adjusted child...

18:03.698 --> 18:06.098
...who is prepared to go out
and take on the world...

18:06.267 --> 18:09.168
...and I think what you've done
is just terrific.

18:09.971 --> 18:11.871
-You know something, Mert?
-Yeah.

18:12.039 --> 18:14.837
-I have to be completely honest with you.
-Mm-hm.

18:15.009 --> 18:17.102
My son lives with me.

18:17.278 --> 18:18.609
Oh.

18:19.347 --> 18:20.814
He's still in school?

18:20.982 --> 18:25.646
He's 29. I know what you're thinking.
He should have his own place hands down.

18:25.820 --> 18:28.983
But, you know,
the thing is we made a big agreement.

18:29.157 --> 18:30.886
That he could live at home
until he makes...

18:31.058 --> 18:32.958
-...his first astronomical discovery.
-Oh.

18:33.327 --> 18:36.262
Astronom-- Wow, that's--
Boy, that sounds ambitious.

18:36.430 --> 18:38.455
-Yeah.
-I'd love to meet him.

18:39.801 --> 18:40.790
Sure, of course.

18:40.968 --> 18:45.234
But you're not talking about now, right?
No, yeah, because he's not actually here.

18:45.406 --> 18:48.136
-It could be another time.
-Okay. Another time, well, good.

18:48.309 --> 18:50.539
Well, listen, I'll call you.

18:50.711 --> 18:52.178
-Oh, okay.
-All right.

18:52.346 --> 18:54.246
Sure. Do that. Whoa. Ha-ha.

18:56.617 --> 18:57.811
-Oh, boy.
-Good night.

18:57.985 --> 18:59.316
Good night.

20:20.301 --> 20:21.791
Jeffrey?

20:21.969 --> 20:23.994
That's my name, don't wear it out.

20:24.171 --> 20:26.401
Well, what are you doing up?

20:26.574 --> 20:29.042
Where did you say you were again?

20:29.210 --> 20:31.701
I told you, sweetie. I was out with Barbara.

20:31.879 --> 20:34.439
-Lie! I called Barbara's house.
-Hah!

20:34.615 --> 20:36.845
Her son told me he was with her all night.

20:37.018 --> 20:40.044
You've been cavorting around
with that Mert character, haven't you?

20:40.221 --> 20:43.349
-Oh, tough.
-I knew it.

20:44.125 --> 20:46.184
Have you had sex with him?

20:46.360 --> 20:49.659
-I'm not going to answer that.
-You have.

20:49.830 --> 20:53.857
Oh. I hope you used a condom.
I'm sure he has herpes.

20:54.035 --> 20:55.263
Oh!

21:00.107 --> 21:02.041
-I want you to meet him.
-Forget it. No!

21:02.209 --> 21:05.610
If you wanna skulk around behind my back
with some VD-ridden sex maniac...

21:05.780 --> 21:09.079
...who keeps you out until
all hours of the night, that's your business.

21:09.250 --> 21:11.684
-But I want nothing to do with him.
-Can't you just...

21:11.852 --> 21:14.582
...make this easier on me for once,
Jeffrey, and meet him?

21:14.755 --> 21:16.313
I'm sorry, but the answer is no.

21:16.490 --> 21:20.085
Come on, sweetie.
We can go to Putt-Putt.

21:20.328 --> 21:21.852
Hmm?

21:22.363 --> 21:23.955
Hmm?

21:26.267 --> 21:29.498
So, Mert. You ever been married before?

21:29.670 --> 21:30.694
I was married once.

21:30.871 --> 21:32.463
-Divorced?
-Deceased.

21:32.640 --> 21:34.267
-Any kids?
-No.

21:34.442 --> 21:35.773
Why do you hate children?

21:35.943 --> 21:38.912
Well, actually,
my wife had ovarian cancer.

21:40.081 --> 21:42.982
Would you call yourself a religious man?

21:43.317 --> 21:44.750
I'm agnostic.

21:44.919 --> 21:47.581
-Don't believe in God, I guess?
-That's an atheist.

21:47.755 --> 21:51.486
How many pieces of string would it take
to connect the Earth to the moon?

21:51.659 --> 21:52.751
One, if it were long enough.

21:57.465 --> 21:59.057
Go ahead, just--
-So, we can just--

21:59.233 --> 22:01.565
Yeah, bend over. Come on. I know.

22:01.736 --> 22:03.101
Just bend over.

22:03.270 --> 22:05.568
Excuse us for just a second.

22:07.808 --> 22:09.105
-Hit it softer. Yeah.
-Yeah!

22:09.276 --> 22:11.676
-Okay, all right, okay.
-Oh. Okay.

22:11.846 --> 22:14.144
-Not bad, huh? Go ahead, Jeffrey.
-Thank you, Mert.

22:14.315 --> 22:18.479
Show us how.
Well, you know, I play a little bit, so....

22:18.652 --> 22:21.917
-Come on, Jeffrey. Show us how.
-Yes, Jeffrey, yes.

22:22.089 --> 22:24.182
Here you go, Jeffrey.

22:25.559 --> 22:28.426
Ah! Oh!

22:28.596 --> 22:30.291
-Jeffrey!
-Oh!

22:30.464 --> 22:32.329
-Nice shot.
-Hats off, Jeffrey.

22:32.500 --> 22:34.593
-Outstanding.
-Oh, my.

22:34.769 --> 22:39.934
It's called a triple ricochet, Mert,
and it took me years to perfect.

22:40.107 --> 22:42.701
Isn't this so much fun?
You know what, sweetie?

22:42.877 --> 22:44.105
You know what we could do?

22:44.278 --> 22:48.271
We could-- Maybe next time you could
bring a date, and we could play doubles.

22:48.449 --> 22:50.747
You know dating is not an option for me...

22:50.918 --> 22:53.113
...given the lack of privacy
I have in the house.

22:53.287 --> 22:54.914
Honey.

23:01.796 --> 23:03.730
Oh! Look what he did.
-Yes!

23:03.898 --> 23:05.661
Ha-ha.
-Ho! Ho-ho!

23:06.567 --> 23:08.728
Beginner's luck. That's all that was.

23:10.071 --> 23:13.006
-Oh. I know!
-That's just-- How impressive is that?

23:13.174 --> 23:15.142
Well, I read the break. That's what I did.

23:18.012 --> 23:22.779
Well, what do you know, Jeffrey.
We're tied at 29. I could live with that.

23:23.250 --> 23:26.310
Naturally, you'd be content
with mediocrity, Mert.

23:26.487 --> 23:30.480
I, on the other hand,
play to taste the savory thrill of victory.

23:30.658 --> 23:32.751
Fine, all right, suit yourself.

23:32.927 --> 23:34.827
Your mom's waiting in the car.

23:34.995 --> 23:38.522
She's a little bit worn out
from having played for five hours.

23:49.043 --> 23:50.738
Ho!

23:50.911 --> 23:54.574
Ha-ha! Should have gone
with a tie, son. Ha-ha-ha.

24:03.958 --> 24:08.190
-Oh. Tough luck there.
-No, that's a do-over.

24:08.362 --> 24:11.354
Official rules state
I'm eligible for another turn.

24:15.669 --> 24:16.693
Oh-- Got it.

24:17.138 --> 24:19.868
He's entering the third stage
of shock right now.

24:20.040 --> 24:22.565
I gotta get out of here.
I have very fragile--

24:22.743 --> 24:25.109
-Give me your hand, son.
-I can't.

24:25.279 --> 24:28.112
It's cutting deep into my flesh.
I think I can feel the blood.

24:28.282 --> 24:31.581
-It's a dull blade, sir. There's nothing there.
-No, give me some gauze.

24:31.752 --> 24:34.050
-I need some gauze.
Come on, give me a hand. Push.

24:34.221 --> 24:37.384
-Push? I'm not giving birth here.
-Chuck, get the Jaws of Life.

24:37.558 --> 24:40.721
Mert? If you can hear me,
I get another shot.

24:41.295 --> 24:43.729
Mert. Whoo. What a guy, huh?

24:44.265 --> 24:48.725
Honey? Did you--? What did you--? What did
you think of Mert? I mean, did you--?

24:48.903 --> 24:51.565
I'm sorry. I can't give you my blessing.

24:51.739 --> 24:54.537
He simply doesn't have
your best interest at heart.

24:54.708 --> 24:57.370
I suggest you break it off
with him via e-mail...

24:57.545 --> 24:59.979
...he may react violently
if you do it in person.

25:00.147 --> 25:03.344
Morning, gang.
-Hi, M-mert.

25:03.517 --> 25:04.848
What are you doing here?

25:06.353 --> 25:10.346
Uh.... Haven't you told him yet?

25:10.524 --> 25:13.391
-Told me what?
-Well....

25:14.295 --> 25:16.195
-Well....
-Well...

25:16.363 --> 25:20.493
...Jeffrey, your mother and I
have made a decision.

25:20.668 --> 25:22.363
You're never going
to see each other again?

25:23.737 --> 25:28.174
-No.
-No, no.

25:28.342 --> 25:31.368
No, no, no, sweetheart, no, no.

25:31.545 --> 25:35.606
Actually, what's happening is
that Mert is going to kind of like...

25:35.783 --> 25:39.776
...kind of, sort of move...

25:39.954 --> 25:42.149
...in, around the house a little bit,
you know?

25:42.323 --> 25:46.851
Kind of like on a temporary sort of--
Like sort of be here, and kind of--

25:47.027 --> 25:50.827
Oh, God.
Mert, move in. Like, with us, and....

25:51.532 --> 25:55.935
Well, we wanna....
We want to know how you feel.

25:56.770 --> 25:58.328
Jeffrey?

26:00.407 --> 26:02.500
Can I speak to you in private, please?

26:16.257 --> 26:17.383
Obviously you're upset.

26:17.558 --> 26:20.391
Of course I'm upset.
I wasn't even consulted, for Pete's sake.

26:20.561 --> 26:24.156
I'm so sorry. It's just that the last six weeks
have been a whirlwind and--

26:24.331 --> 26:26.424
What was all that
about you wanting my opinion?

26:26.600 --> 26:28.158
You don't care about what I think.

26:28.335 --> 26:30.565
Of course I care what you think,
you're my son.

26:30.738 --> 26:32.763
I love you more
than anything in the world...

26:32.940 --> 26:36.205
...and Mert's moving in
isn't going to change that one iota.

26:36.377 --> 26:39.744
Now, I know this is an adjustment,
but you know what I think?

26:39.913 --> 26:43.041
I think you're gonna enjoy
having a man around the house.

26:43.217 --> 26:44.980
I am a man around the house.

26:45.152 --> 26:48.053
Fixed the sink.
The p-trap collar nut was loose.

26:48.656 --> 26:50.647
<i>It's two machines in one.</i>

26:50.824 --> 26:53.987
<i>Now for the first time ever
you can make homemade sausage...</i>

26:54.161 --> 26:58.063
<i>...and homemade pasta
as easy as one, two, three.</i>

27:04.338 --> 27:09.469
Look, I know we sprung this on you
a little bit abruptly...

27:09.643 --> 27:13.579
...so I don't blame you if you feel angry.
That's an authentic emotion.

27:13.747 --> 27:16.944
I encourage you
to go ahead and experience it.

27:17.951 --> 27:21.045
But just so you know...

27:21.221 --> 27:24.782
...I don't wanna
replace your father, and I.... Ha. Heh.

27:24.958 --> 27:27.518
I don't expect you to call me dad.

27:28.128 --> 27:33.998
But I do have one request,
and that is that you just give me a chance.

27:35.803 --> 27:37.828
You're a good kid, Jeffrey.

27:39.039 --> 27:41.030
I'd like to be your friend.

27:44.878 --> 27:46.505
You know...

27:47.648 --> 27:50.515
...only those who risk going too far...

27:50.684 --> 27:55.485
...can possibly find out
how far they can go.

27:56.490 --> 27:57.855
Hmm.

27:58.826 --> 28:00.726
I wrote that.

28:04.365 --> 28:05.662
Mitch, I need your help.

28:05.833 --> 28:08.233
Sorry, Jeffrey.
We stopped selling interactive porn.

28:08.402 --> 28:12.736
No. I want you to do some hacking for me.
His name is Merton Jacob Rosenbloom...

28:12.906 --> 28:15.898
...and I want all the dirt
you can dig up on him.

28:17.244 --> 28:19.940
-Fifty bucks.
-That's ridiculous.

28:20.114 --> 28:21.547
You're ridiculous.

28:26.820 --> 28:31.723
I'll give you 25 dollars
and a Warburtons discount card.

28:43.170 --> 28:46.162
Great choice, sir.
One of our most popular games.

28:46.340 --> 28:50.140
Good, good.
It's a gift for my girlfriend's son.

28:50.310 --> 28:53.211
-Cash or charge?
-Charge.

29:00.220 --> 29:01.551
Wai--

29:02.322 --> 29:04.017
You're Merton J. Rosenbloom?

29:05.692 --> 29:07.182
That's right. Heh.

29:07.361 --> 29:09.295
I might have some information...

29:09.463 --> 29:12.557
...about your girlfriend's son
you want to know.

29:12.733 --> 29:15.133
Really? What--? What is it?

29:31.552 --> 29:34.350
Hey! Hey!

29:34.521 --> 29:36.250
You remember me?

29:36.423 --> 29:38.323
-Remember?
-Oh, yeah.

29:38.492 --> 29:40.585
You want a ride?

29:40.761 --> 29:43.025
Yeah, then when I was like 17,
my dad was all:

29:43.197 --> 29:45.927
"Get rid of the tattoo
or get out of the house."

29:46.099 --> 29:48.932
So like, I've been on my own ever since.

29:50.471 --> 29:52.439
Why don't you have a car?

29:53.507 --> 29:56.738
I have severe carpal tunnel syndrome.

30:08.655 --> 30:11.419
Well, thanks for the ride.

30:11.592 --> 30:15.551
-It was nice of you.
-Actually, do you wanna get a beer?

30:16.864 --> 30:18.354
Um....

30:18.899 --> 30:22.027
My life's very complicated right now.

30:22.202 --> 30:25.399
It's too complicated for a beer?

30:25.572 --> 30:29.099
Look, I appreciate the invitation...

30:29.276 --> 30:32.439
...but I think you should know
I'm seeing someone else.

30:32.613 --> 30:34.046
Her name's Allison.

30:35.582 --> 30:38.608
Whatever, you know. I just....

30:38.785 --> 30:40.878
Just trying to be nice.

30:41.088 --> 30:44.785
All right. Goodbye.

30:44.958 --> 30:46.983
Bye.

31:05.212 --> 31:07.646
The basement? Have you gone mad?

31:07.814 --> 31:10.044
I wouldn't even survive
a night in that dank cave.

31:10.217 --> 31:12.447
You know how sensitive
my joints are to moisture.

31:12.619 --> 31:15.952
Now, it's perfectly dry down there,
and guess what. Guess what we did.

31:16.123 --> 31:20.219
We put in the old TV and VCR down there
so it's gonna be like your own bachelor pad.

31:20.394 --> 31:22.487
Honey? Oh, sweetheart.

31:22.663 --> 31:24.631
-Would you just please go away?
-Hey, buddy.

31:24.798 --> 31:26.959
Was this a great idea,
or was this a great idea?

31:27.134 --> 31:30.968
I was thinking the other night. You were
talking about how you didn't have privacy.

31:31.138 --> 31:32.162
That's when it hit me.

31:32.339 --> 31:35.797
I bet you can't wait to get to that basement
and start bringing in those ladies.

31:35.976 --> 31:37.967
-Ha-ha-ha.
-Oh, Mert. Oh.

31:38.879 --> 31:41.848
Here, take it.

31:42.015 --> 31:44.210
Take it, go on.

31:44.851 --> 31:49.754
It's just something from me to say
thank you for welcoming me to the family.

31:49.923 --> 31:51.481
-So sweet.
-Yeah.

31:51.658 --> 31:53.626
Well, open it, silly.

31:59.099 --> 32:01.329
-Oh, looky-look.
-But turn the--

32:01.501 --> 32:02.798
-Can I see that?
-Come on.

32:02.970 --> 32:04.369
What is it? What does it say?

32:04.538 --> 32:06.472
Ta-da! Ha-ha-ha.
Oh.

32:06.640 --> 32:09.803
You are now officially
a member of Team Rosenbloom.

32:13.246 --> 32:15.339
What do you say, Jeffrey? Jeffrey?

32:15.515 --> 32:16.982
<i>Please.</i>

32:17.884 --> 32:20.375
Thank you so much, Mert.

32:23.223 --> 32:25.350
You're welcome, buddy.

32:26.026 --> 32:27.357
-Whoo! Ha-ha-ha.
Ha-ha-ha.

32:27.527 --> 32:29.392
Scared you. Ha-ha-ha.

32:29.563 --> 32:30.996
Oh.

32:31.365 --> 32:34.528
I gotta tell you,
I got nothing on your boy. Diddlysquat.

32:34.701 --> 32:36.635
What? That's impossible.

32:36.803 --> 32:38.464
The Internet doesn't lie, bro.

32:38.639 --> 32:42.541
He's totally clean. Never been arrested,
no funny diseases, nothing.

32:44.177 --> 32:45.644
That's ridiculous.

32:46.780 --> 32:50.716
What do you think is more deviant?
Bondage or bestiality?

32:50.884 --> 32:52.909
<i>No, I don't know, dude.</i>

32:53.086 --> 32:54.553
<i>I haven't seen a boob in three years.</i>

32:55.922 --> 32:57.048
<i>It was at the pool.</i>

32:57.224 --> 32:58.851
Wait. Shh. Hold on.

32:59.493 --> 33:03.361
<i>She got out of the pool
and it just flopped out.</i>

33:16.009 --> 33:17.135
Oh, Mert. Oh!

33:17.310 --> 33:20.177
I'm having my way with you.
-No, they're headed for the bedroom.

33:21.982 --> 33:24.746
<i>Dude, what's going on?
Who's headed for the bedroom?</i>

33:24.918 --> 33:27.819
-Oh, Mert. Oh, Mert. Oh, honey.
-Oh! Oh!

33:27.988 --> 33:31.253
Your thighs are like a bear trap.
-Ugh!

33:31.425 --> 33:33.416
Oh.... Oh!

33:34.895 --> 33:36.692
<i>And everything's sponsored</i>

33:36.863 --> 33:38.888
<i>By huge corporations</i>

33:39.232 --> 33:43.896
<i>What will be next?
A Del Taco space station</i>

33:45.605 --> 33:49.666
<i>This corporate culture
Just sucks out our brains</i>

33:49.843 --> 33:55.076
<i>While the corporate vultures
Eat our remains</i>

33:56.383 --> 34:00.615
<i>From Wolfgang Pucks to Family Feud</i>

34:00.787 --> 34:05.190
<i>It all sucks and we're all screwed</i>

34:05.358 --> 34:09.317
<i>There's no way to escape</i>

34:09.663 --> 34:15.295
<i>From the corporate rape</i>

34:15.469 --> 34:20.371
<i>And this world that we're living in
Is headed for oblivion</i>

34:20.540 --> 34:24.636
<i>If you don't stop buying crap
At Staples and Baby Gap</i>

34:24.811 --> 34:30.340
<i>I'm an old-fashioned girl
And I'm stuck in a corporate world</i>

34:30.717 --> 34:34.880
<i>Hey, what can I say
I'm an old-fashioned girl</i>

34:35.054 --> 34:39.492
<i>That says screw this whole corporate world</i>

34:41.393 --> 34:42.418
<i>Yeah</i>

34:45.398 --> 34:48.993
-Whoo!
-Thank you, Skyler.

34:50.303 --> 34:52.828
-Well done.
-What are you doing here?

34:54.507 --> 34:55.770
Where's Allison?

34:55.942 --> 34:59.002
Actually, Allison and I just broke up.

34:59.179 --> 35:02.376
Long distance relationships
are impossible to maintain.

35:02.549 --> 35:04.517
I hear that.

35:04.684 --> 35:06.675
I guess I'll see you around.

35:06.853 --> 35:08.343
Wait a minute.

35:08.522 --> 35:11.685
I want to apologize
for being so brusque earlier.

35:12.526 --> 35:14.084
Whatever.

35:14.294 --> 35:16.387
Uh-- Wait.

35:16.563 --> 35:20.795
I want to make amends. Let me
buy you a cup of coffee or something.

35:22.736 --> 35:25.364
It's been a really long night,
I don't think so.

35:25.539 --> 35:27.700
You would be doing me a colossal favor.

35:27.874 --> 35:30.240
See, I can't go home right now...

35:30.410 --> 35:33.573
...because my mother
is having violent sex with her new lover.

35:35.582 --> 35:38.881
-Okay. One cup of coffee.
-Waitress!

35:39.052 --> 35:41.577
No! God, no, not here, the coffee sucks.

35:44.925 --> 35:48.554
So, I used to date this guy, Trip.
He was the last guy I dated.

35:48.728 --> 35:51.424
And he had this band
called the Taco Shits.

35:51.598 --> 35:55.625
And he wrote all, like,
these really poetic, beautiful songs.

35:55.802 --> 35:58.828
And then I found out
that he stole them all off the Internet.

35:59.005 --> 36:01.030
And I was like, "Oh, that's so lame."

36:01.208 --> 36:05.008
And that's why I hate this city, you know?
Because it's all a bunch of posers.

36:05.178 --> 36:07.772
And I just feel like
as soon as I get enough money...

36:07.948 --> 36:10.849
...I am gonna get out of here
because I can't stand it anymore.

36:11.017 --> 36:13.485
-Do you wanna sit here? This good?
-Oh, sure.

36:13.653 --> 36:15.951
Well, where are you gonna go?

36:16.122 --> 36:18.750
I think I'm gonna go to Austin, Texas.

36:18.959 --> 36:20.119
I wanna check it out.

36:20.293 --> 36:23.160
It's got this really,
really cool indie music scene there.

36:23.563 --> 36:25.531
Have you been there?

36:26.466 --> 36:30.903
Actually, I did go there one summer,
for an astronomy conference...

36:31.071 --> 36:34.040
...but I usually try to avoid
trips like that whenever possible.

36:34.574 --> 36:37.509
Why? You don't really like to travel?

36:37.711 --> 36:41.511
Unfortunately, my mother's ill
and needs my constant attention.

36:41.681 --> 36:46.015
Oh. That's really, really cool
that you take care of her.

36:46.186 --> 36:49.178
Yeah. It's my cross to bear.

36:49.356 --> 36:51.916
Well, that really sucks
that you have to live at home.

36:52.092 --> 36:56.961
Well, at least it affords me the financial
freedom to pursue my life's work.

36:57.130 --> 37:00.827
For the last seven years,
I've been tracking what I believe to be...

37:01.001 --> 37:04.835
...a long-period comet
which emanates from the Oort cloud.

37:05.338 --> 37:07.329
That's cool.

37:07.707 --> 37:09.004
Oort.

37:11.578 --> 37:13.239
What's up, Nora?

37:13.413 --> 37:15.472
What do you want, Trip?

37:15.649 --> 37:19.676
-I'd like a tall latte, extra hot.
-Heh-heh-heh.

37:19.853 --> 37:22.344
-That's a good one, Trip.
-Ha-ha-ha.

37:22.522 --> 37:24.922
Yes, Trip. Very clever.

37:26.293 --> 37:29.285
I've seen you before.
You work at that bookstore, right?

37:29.462 --> 37:31.225
Yes, I do.

37:31.398 --> 37:34.492
Well, that's messed up, bro.
That place is, like, old...

37:34.668 --> 37:36.397
...and shit.

37:36.569 --> 37:39.504
Wow, you have a real gift for language.

37:39.673 --> 37:42.767
I'm shocked you had to
pilfer your lyrics off the Internet.

37:45.845 --> 37:49.110
-Screw you, dude.
-Jeffrey. Come on, let's get out of here.

37:52.018 --> 37:54.486
-You was a ho, anyway.
Oh! Ooh!

37:54.654 --> 37:56.519
It doesn't matter.

37:57.757 --> 37:58.951
What did you call her?

37:59.326 --> 38:01.590
I called her a bizznatch.

38:04.297 --> 38:05.662
Aah!

38:06.433 --> 38:08.833
-Oh!
-Ah! Trip!

38:09.002 --> 38:10.663
-Oh, oh.
Are you okay?

38:11.705 --> 38:13.138
I'm hemorrhaging.

38:13.940 --> 38:15.805
You haven't heard the last of me!

38:15.976 --> 38:18.467
I'll sue you, you monster!

38:18.645 --> 38:21.443
Hurry. Get a napkin, stat.

38:21.614 --> 38:23.912
I think I may be a hemophiliac.

38:25.118 --> 38:27.552
So is your nose okay?

38:27.721 --> 38:31.020
I think that barbarian broke it.

38:31.191 --> 38:33.625
Hey, cool. Whose hybrid?

38:33.793 --> 38:36.853
That's my mother's beau du jour.

38:37.030 --> 38:39.794
This is Mert again.
-Speak of the devil.

38:40.667 --> 38:42.760
So call me, please.

38:42.936 --> 38:45.734
Don't look at him, you'll turn to stone.

38:45.905 --> 38:47.998
-Hey there. Oh!
-Hi.

38:48.174 --> 38:50.074
What happened to your nose, Jeffrey?
Heh-heh-heh.

38:50.243 --> 38:52.370
Life happened to my nose, Mert.

38:52.545 --> 38:54.775
What are you guys doing
out at this hour anyway?

38:54.948 --> 38:56.916
Isn't it a little past your beddy-bye time?

38:58.251 --> 39:00.685
Gee, it's hard to imagine
why I'd wanna leave...

39:00.854 --> 39:03.345
...all the luxury and comfort
of my dungeon.

39:03.523 --> 39:05.423
What are you doing outside
on the phone?

39:05.592 --> 39:08.425
-Hi, I'm Mert.
-Hey, I'm Nora.

39:08.595 --> 39:09.755
What do you do, Nora?

39:09.929 --> 39:13.057
-Well, I work in a coffeehouse--
-Nora is an aspiring iconoclast.

39:13.233 --> 39:15.667
-And she was just leaving.
-Hey.

39:15.835 --> 39:19.271
Would you like to join us Saturday?
We're having a family picnic.

39:19.439 --> 39:21.202
-No, we're not.
-Actually, we are.

39:21.374 --> 39:24.935
I decided to do something special
for your mother's half-birthday.

39:25.111 --> 39:27.079
You must've forgotten.

39:27.247 --> 39:31.741
I am far too busy to keep track
of fractions of people's birthdays.

39:31.918 --> 39:35.012
And anyway, I'm sure Nora
doesn't have the time nor the desire...

39:35.188 --> 39:38.157
...to subject herself to that kind of horror.

39:39.292 --> 39:42.750
Well, actually, I'd really like to go.

39:43.730 --> 39:45.163
See?

39:47.233 --> 39:48.996
All right.

39:49.803 --> 39:51.998
What are you guys gonna do now?

39:54.274 --> 39:55.866
I don't know.

40:01.548 --> 40:04.176
You must be Nora. I'm Jan.

40:04.350 --> 40:05.647
-Hi.
-Hi.

40:05.819 --> 40:06.843
Nice to meet you.

40:07.020 --> 40:10.285
Oh, God, you have no idea
how happy I am to meet you.

40:10.457 --> 40:13.255
Words cannot express it. Ooh.

40:14.360 --> 40:15.987
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

40:16.162 --> 40:20.326
Oh, my goodness, look at you. All right
now, listen, Mert is out back on grill duty.

40:20.500 --> 40:23.697
Jeffrey's getting dressed.
Jeffrey! Jeffrey!

40:38.451 --> 40:41.420
That's Jeffrey. Look at him.
Little fat butterball.

40:41.588 --> 40:44.352
You could just eat
that little face right up, couldn't you?

40:44.524 --> 40:46.754
He was really big.

40:46.926 --> 40:49.190
Oh, he was huge.

40:49.362 --> 40:51.057
Yeah, I mean, he was a month late.

40:51.231 --> 40:55.031
And so, eventually they had to
induce labor and it was kind of a battle.

40:55.201 --> 40:59.638
The doctor had to use forceps, and it was
kind of like a tug-of-war, you know?

40:59.806 --> 41:03.640
Because every time they'd get Jeffrey's
head out, he'd pop right back inside of me.

41:03.810 --> 41:05.710
This went on for just hours and hours...

41:05.879 --> 41:09.315
...and finally, they had to inject
a mild tranquilizer into his skull...

41:09.482 --> 41:13.646
...and then he kind of
slid right out after that and....

41:20.326 --> 41:23.887
Jeffrey, honey. Nora's here!

41:28.902 --> 41:31.200
That's John. That's Jeffrey's dad.

41:31.371 --> 41:33.236
He was in the Rotary club.

41:33.406 --> 41:34.668
Anyway.

41:36.743 --> 41:38.608
Oh-- See this?

41:38.778 --> 41:42.077
Jeffrey is 12 years old, and that's
right after he got back from Austin.

41:42.248 --> 41:45.274
He went to an astronomy convention
when he was 12?

41:45.451 --> 41:48.284
No. He went to a fat farm.

41:48.621 --> 41:51.419
Who's ready for a picnic?

41:54.160 --> 41:56.560
-These ribs are delicious.
-Mmm.

41:56.729 --> 41:58.060
Thank you, Nora.

41:58.231 --> 42:00.563
-Mert is a magician with meat.
-Oh.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.127
-Ha-ha.
-Oh.

42:03.703 --> 42:05.364
Do you have any more barbecue sauce?

42:05.538 --> 42:08.132
-Oh, yes, of course we do.
-In the....

42:11.044 --> 42:13.444
-Did you bring this, Mert?
-No.

42:13.613 --> 42:15.342
It's addressed to you.

42:16.449 --> 42:19.782
Why don't you open it, Mert?
I always enjoy a good read after lunch.

42:19.953 --> 42:21.113
Sure, open it.

42:23.856 --> 42:24.845
All right.

42:30.330 --> 42:31.763
Oh.

42:31.998 --> 42:34.159
What is frontierism?

42:34.867 --> 42:37.665
Actually, I think
it's pronounced frotteurism.

42:37.837 --> 42:41.705
It's a deviant sexual behavior in which
the frotteur becomes sexually aroused...

42:41.874 --> 42:45.537
...by rubbing his genitals
against others in public places.

42:45.712 --> 42:48.579
-Oh.
-I read about it on the Internet.

42:48.748 --> 42:52.013
Do you subscribe to that magazine, Mert?

42:55.655 --> 42:57.885
Actually, I do.

42:58.091 --> 43:01.083
I have a client who is a frotteur.

43:01.261 --> 43:03.695
He's having a difficult time
overcoming his problem...

43:03.863 --> 43:07.959
...and I thought if I could understand
what it was like to be a frotteur...

43:08.134 --> 43:09.931
-...l'd be better prepared to help him.
-Oh.

43:11.304 --> 43:12.669
I mean, he is....

43:15.375 --> 43:17.969
He is such a good kid, darn it. Tsk.

43:18.144 --> 43:21.841
I just wanna help him get past this,
you know? Live up to his full potential.

43:22.015 --> 43:23.141
That's really cool.

43:23.316 --> 43:25.045
Thrilling is what it is.
Well....

43:25.518 --> 43:26.746
Moving.

43:27.987 --> 43:30.251
So, Nora.

43:30.890 --> 43:33.154
Did you study music in college?

43:33.326 --> 43:36.784
-I took a couple of guitar lessons.
-Mm!

43:36.963 --> 43:41.400
Jeffrey was accepted to
the Lunar Space Institute in Austin.

43:42.702 --> 43:44.465
Really?

43:44.637 --> 43:46.161
How was that?

43:46.339 --> 43:50.173
-Jeffrey didn't exactly finish.
-I cut my college experience short...

43:50.343 --> 43:53.710
...to save my mother the trauma
of empty nest syndrome, Mert.

43:53.880 --> 43:55.040
Cut it short, Jeffrey?

43:55.214 --> 43:57.876
No, no. Remember?
You showed me your dorm room...

43:58.051 --> 43:59.780
...and you made me take you home.

43:59.952 --> 44:03.353
It was like a prison cell. And did you see
who would've been my roommate?

44:03.523 --> 44:05.616
All covered in tattoos and piercings.

44:05.792 --> 44:09.626
I'm sure he and his friends would've gotten
intoxicated one night and sodomized me.

44:09.796 --> 44:10.956
Jeffrey.

44:11.130 --> 44:14.327
Sometimes we confuse our fears
with our fantasies, Jeffrey.

44:15.768 --> 44:17.998
I myself loved college.

44:18.171 --> 44:22.107
Getting away from my parents,
being on my own in Berkeley.

44:22.275 --> 44:24.334
I mean, it was a very exciting time.

44:24.510 --> 44:25.807
Mm. Heh.

44:25.978 --> 44:29.243
Berkeley in the '60s?
Must have been very exciting.

44:29.415 --> 44:32.612
All you hippies shooting up acid
and snorting LSD.

44:32.785 --> 44:37.722
I mean, I might have smoked a little pot,
but who hasn't, you know?

44:37.890 --> 44:40.154
I haven't.

44:40.326 --> 44:43.921
Neither have I. Because drugs are wrong.

44:44.097 --> 44:46.224
I tend to agree.

44:46.966 --> 44:49.560
Well, that was a long time ago.

44:51.337 --> 44:55.068
Nora? Do you make a living as a singer?

44:55.241 --> 44:57.209
Well, that's the dream.

44:57.377 --> 44:58.605
What's holding you back?

44:58.778 --> 45:02.214
I'm just trying to save up enough money
so I can record a demo.

45:02.382 --> 45:04.373
But I can't afford it right now.

45:04.550 --> 45:07.485
I'm-- I'm sorry, what did--?
What did you say?

45:08.521 --> 45:10.011
I said I can't afford it.

45:10.189 --> 45:12.521
No, see, I still don't understand you...

45:12.692 --> 45:15.388
...because the word "can't"
isn't in my vocabulary.

45:16.062 --> 45:19.793
You see, Nora, I believe
that if you really want something in life...

45:19.966 --> 45:22.901
...you gotta go after it.
You can't let anything hold you back.

45:23.636 --> 45:25.763
-You just said "can't."
Uh-uh-- Mm.

45:25.938 --> 45:28.202
Jeffrey, please, just be quiet.

45:28.374 --> 45:31.434
I don't get it. I mean, how am I supposed
to record a demo...

45:31.611 --> 45:33.579
...if I don't have the money to pay for it?

45:33.746 --> 45:38.376
The future belongs to those who believe
in the beauty of their dreams.

45:40.787 --> 45:42.379
Lightning bolt. Lightning bolt.

45:42.555 --> 45:45.319
Lightning bolt. Lightning bolt.
Lightning bolt.

45:45.491 --> 45:47.925
Have pity, Gallantar,
I'm but a simple Mage.

45:48.094 --> 45:51.120
-Silver. Silver. Silver.
-Stop, I'm dead, Gallantar!

45:51.297 --> 45:55.165
-Enchanted. Enchanted.
-Stop, Gallantar! Time freeze! Ow!

45:55.334 --> 45:56.631
Get off me. Get off.

45:56.803 --> 45:59.203
He called time freeze, Gallantar.
That means stop!

45:59.372 --> 46:03.206
I'm the game master, Rathkon.
I get to call the shots around here.

46:04.744 --> 46:06.109
You hit me in the forehead.

46:06.279 --> 46:09.715
I have a deposition tomorrow
and I'm gonna look ridiculous.

46:11.951 --> 46:13.646
What's wrong with you, Gallantar?

46:13.820 --> 46:16.311
Sorry, Alhorn, my old friend.

46:16.923 --> 46:19.391
I've brought my troubles
from home to the battlefield.

46:19.959 --> 46:21.119
The boyfriend?

46:24.130 --> 46:27.065
You must confront
this enemy head on, Gallantar.

46:28.034 --> 46:32.198
For your own sake,
and for the sake of the Land of Erdreja!

46:38.144 --> 46:39.668
Ahh.

46:40.346 --> 46:41.973
How do you like thine grog?

46:42.448 --> 46:45.042
It's not grog. This is apple juice.

46:45.218 --> 46:49.712
Well, yeah, I mean,
my parents locked the liquor cabinet, so I....

46:49.889 --> 46:51.686
It's got a lot of sugar in it, though, so....

46:57.730 --> 46:59.630
How may I help you elves?

46:59.799 --> 47:01.232
I'm looking for Mert Rosenbloom.

47:01.400 --> 47:04.699
Why, are you trying to steal
the magic orbs?

47:11.277 --> 47:12.403
I'll call you back.

47:14.046 --> 47:15.513
Wrong cord.

47:16.516 --> 47:18.984
-What's up, Lancelot?
-Your time in my life is up.

47:19.151 --> 47:21.642
My mother's not big enough
for the two of us.

47:21.821 --> 47:24.346
I'm sorry, Ace.
I love her, and I'm not leaving.

47:24.524 --> 47:26.719
Well, I'm not leaving either.

47:26.893 --> 47:30.294
You know, Jeffrey,
it doesn't have to be this way.

47:30.463 --> 47:32.226
I hereby throw down this gauntlet.

47:35.501 --> 47:37.025
That sounds like glass.

47:37.203 --> 47:38.636
You're gonna pay for that.

47:40.172 --> 47:41.469
War is hell, old man.

47:41.641 --> 47:43.973
Yes, it is.

47:45.011 --> 47:46.945
And you're going down.

47:47.113 --> 47:48.603
That's a promise, son.

47:51.450 --> 47:53.281
See you on the battlefield.

48:03.529 --> 48:05.588
Don't call me son.

48:05.765 --> 48:08.131
So then I just went out
and got my tubes tied.

48:08.301 --> 48:11.031
Oh. You wanna go to Comic-Con?

48:11.203 --> 48:15.401
It's important to always create a kind
of positive atmosphere in the work home.

48:15.575 --> 48:17.509
And when I say "work home," I mean...

48:17.677 --> 48:20.612
...a place where you can have
a warm, kind of comfortable...

48:20.780 --> 48:22.771
...relaxing, kind of....

48:22.949 --> 48:24.814
You know,
an environment where people...

48:24.984 --> 48:27.953
...really enjoy what they're doing,
and it's--

48:29.555 --> 48:31.489
It's the kind of....

48:32.658 --> 48:35.855
It's the kind of thing that doesn't have--

48:36.028 --> 48:37.655
Goddamn it!

48:53.012 --> 48:54.445
Oh!

49:16.268 --> 49:17.599
Oh!

50:06.485 --> 50:07.884
Oh.

50:16.562 --> 50:18.325
Mert?

50:18.731 --> 50:19.959
Uh-huh?

50:20.132 --> 50:22.066
What is this?

50:23.636 --> 50:26.002
It looks like a bong.

50:27.039 --> 50:29.064
Hmm. With some pot.

50:29.241 --> 50:33.109
That's what I thought,
but you said you don't do drugs anymore.

50:33.279 --> 50:36.646
-I don't.
-Well, then where'd this come from?

50:44.323 --> 50:48.987
Actually, the truth is...

50:50.129 --> 50:53.462
...I do smoke a little pot, once in a while.

50:53.666 --> 50:58.365
-Oh.
-Jan? It's not that, you know....

50:59.138 --> 51:01.504
Honesty is very important to me, Mert.

51:06.512 --> 51:08.377
Mother fucking hell.

51:15.187 --> 51:17.280
Hello? Anyone home?

51:19.759 --> 51:21.192
Tsk. Oh....

51:24.497 --> 51:26.192
Hey, hey.

51:26.365 --> 51:28.230
Are you okay?

51:28.968 --> 51:30.959
What's the matter?

51:32.304 --> 51:35.034
Is it about Mert?

51:37.109 --> 51:42.513
Did you discover something
about him that you didn't know before?

51:42.681 --> 51:48.017
Well, I discovered that Mert smokes pot
because he has glaucoma...

51:48.187 --> 51:50.985
...but that's not actually it.

51:51.957 --> 51:55.051
Wait, then why are you crying?

51:56.662 --> 52:01.827
I'm crying because Mert and I
are gonna get married. Look. Ha-ha.

52:03.836 --> 52:06.498
Grab a glass. Let's celebrate, huh?

52:06.672 --> 52:09.402
You're gonna be a Rosenbloom.

52:09.575 --> 52:12.339
-Come on, baby, let's dance.
-Oh, Mert, no, I'm too embarrassed.

52:13.746 --> 52:17.238
-Oh, no. Come on, come on, come on.
-Ah, sweetie, oh, please. Oh, Mert.

52:17.449 --> 52:19.474
Oh, ha-ha-ha.
Mm.

52:19.652 --> 52:21.882
Oh, you're so snappy, pappy.

52:22.922 --> 52:24.890
Ooh.
How's that?

52:25.057 --> 52:26.684
I feel like I'm on a subway.

52:28.260 --> 52:30.194
Mert, what do you say?
Ha-ha-ha.

52:33.165 --> 52:35.895
We got one other piece of good news.

52:36.936 --> 52:37.925
Jeffrey, dear?

52:38.103 --> 52:40.037
I can't believe you're selling the house.

52:40.206 --> 52:42.231
Look, we feel
it's in everyone's best interest.

52:42.408 --> 52:45.969
This is our home.
I spent my formative years here.

52:46.145 --> 52:48.670
No, of course it's your home, naturally...

52:48.848 --> 52:51.043
...but Mert and I are starting a new life...

52:51.217 --> 52:54.243
...and we want our own home
so that we can make new memories.

52:54.420 --> 52:56.388
New memories.
Brand-new memories, Jeffrey.

52:56.555 --> 52:58.921
Well, I hate to rain on your parade...

52:59.091 --> 53:02.288
...but I refuse to give my consent
on the sale of this house.

53:02.461 --> 53:05.862
Well, I don't need your consent
because the house is in my name.

53:07.433 --> 53:12.268
Okay. Fine.
Let's assume for a moment that's true.

53:12.438 --> 53:15.601
What about me?
Where do I fit into this new house equation?

53:15.774 --> 53:19.471
Well, we're looking at smaller places.

53:19.645 --> 53:22.136
Yeah, condos and whatnot. So....

53:22.314 --> 53:26.944
Yeah. No, but you can come and sleep in
the hideaway bed whenever you come for...

53:27.119 --> 53:29.383
-...like, a little visit.
-Yeah, but, little.

53:29.555 --> 53:30.579
Visit?

53:30.756 --> 53:34.419
Don't worry, sweetie. I would be
so happy to subsidize you for a year...

53:34.593 --> 53:37.187
...two years, or three years,
or something like four--

53:37.363 --> 53:38.557
Or six months.

53:38.731 --> 53:43.134
Six months. As long as it takes
for you to learn how to pay for things.

53:43.302 --> 53:46.499
Fine. You two obviously
don't want me here anymore...

53:46.672 --> 53:48.970
...so maybe I'll just
get out of your hair tonight.

53:49.141 --> 53:51.234
Jeffrey, no.

53:51.410 --> 53:52.843
Yeah.

53:53.012 --> 53:54.775
Mert.

54:05.791 --> 54:06.815
Hey.

54:06.992 --> 54:10.428
Thank goodness you're home.
I'm in desperate need of a Yoo-hoo.

54:10.596 --> 54:14.828
I have this nasty infestation of vermin at my
house which I can't seem to exterminate...

54:15.000 --> 54:17.161
...and it's causing my gastritis to flare up.

54:17.336 --> 54:19.702
Yoo-hoo's the only beverage
that seems to soothe it.

54:19.872 --> 54:21.464
How do you know where I live?

54:21.640 --> 54:25.201
I bribed one of your associates
with a discount card.

54:26.011 --> 54:29.071
Well, unfortunately,
I'm fresh out of Yoo-hoo.

54:38.590 --> 54:41.150
I see you still listen to Morrissey.

54:41.327 --> 54:44.160
Yeah, well,
a lot of his new stuff's really good.

54:44.330 --> 54:46.457
Really? I wouldn't know.

54:46.632 --> 54:50.227
He's been dead to me since 1987
when The Smiths broke up.

54:50.402 --> 54:55.931
How old were you? Like, 10?
You should really give him another shot.

55:22.901 --> 55:25.699
So, what do you think?

55:25.871 --> 55:28.772
It's not atrocious.

55:29.908 --> 55:32.376
I think you're better.

55:35.247 --> 55:37.238
Thanks.

55:48.627 --> 55:50.458
Do you want some?

55:51.463 --> 55:53.363
Marijuana?!

55:53.532 --> 55:56.933
I'm sorry, I say no to drugs
and so should you.

55:58.537 --> 56:00.437
-Are you joking?
-No.

56:00.606 --> 56:06.203
Not only is it illegal, I'm sure it contains
any number of unknown toxic substances.

56:07.012 --> 56:11.813
But go ahead and "trip out"
or whatever it is you hippies do.

56:11.984 --> 56:16.546
I'll just sit here and monitor you
for safety purposes.

56:17.389 --> 56:20.187
Well, it's a good thing you're here.

56:27.733 --> 56:30.201
You're kind of a freak.

56:31.103 --> 56:33.128
Thank you.

56:36.842 --> 56:38.707
Mooo.

56:47.286 --> 56:52.417
Maya, it's Mert again.
I was really hoping that we could talk.

56:52.591 --> 56:56.721
Listen, I'm not sure
why you sent my letter back, but....

56:59.465 --> 57:02.923
I wanna see you, that's all.
All right, I just-- I wanna see you.

57:03.102 --> 57:06.765
So, call me, please. I love you.

57:45.878 --> 57:50.338
Seymour, I need a six-week advance on
my salary so I can purchase a plane ticket.

57:50.516 --> 57:52.347
I'm letting you go, Jeffrey.

57:52.518 --> 57:54.713
-What?
-I'm sorry.

57:54.887 --> 57:57.378
You can't fire me. I'm irreplaceable.

57:57.556 --> 57:59.786
I'm replacing you with Keith.

57:59.958 --> 58:02.791
Don't do this to me, all right?
I love this old bookstore.

58:02.961 --> 58:05.054
Here's your severance check.

58:06.198 --> 58:07.825
I gave you my youth, Seymour.

58:08.000 --> 58:12.528
-If you need a reference, I'd be happy to--
-Burn in hell, old man!

58:16.575 --> 58:20.341
<i>'Cause I believe that freedom's</i>

58:20.512 --> 58:23.845
<i>A right that we all share</i>

58:24.016 --> 58:27.508
<i>But I believe that advertising's</i>

58:27.686 --> 58:30.814
<i>Messing up our air</i>

58:31.557 --> 58:37.985
<i>And when I see a Nike swoosh
On a baseball player's mitt</i>

58:38.163 --> 58:40.597
<i>Hah
It makes me bawl</i>

58:40.766 --> 58:43.166
<i>'Cause the world is all</i>

58:43.335 --> 58:45.360
<i>Bed, Bath and Bullshit</i>

58:45.537 --> 58:47.971
Nora? Nora?

58:48.140 --> 58:50.040
I need you to drive me to Arizona.

58:50.209 --> 58:53.269
What are you doing here?
You just ruined a great take.

58:53.445 --> 58:56.278
Do you have any idea
how hard it is to record a good demo?

58:58.650 --> 58:59.810
What is this?

58:59.985 --> 59:02.510
Proof that Mert is cheating on my mother.

59:03.555 --> 59:05.819
Go ahead, take a gander.

59:06.925 --> 59:09.792
I don't know. I just....

59:09.962 --> 59:11.827
Mert doesn't really seem
like the cheating type.

59:13.398 --> 59:15.832
-They never do.
-So, what do you need me for, anyway?

59:16.001 --> 59:17.901
Why don't you just
show those emails to your mom?

59:18.070 --> 59:21.164
Uh-uh. Too circumstantial.
We need definitive evidence.

59:21.340 --> 59:23.831
Nothing must be left to chance.
Now, come on, let's go.

59:24.009 --> 59:26.705
Jeffrey! I'm in the middle
of recording my demo.

59:26.878 --> 59:29.540
Nora, time is not our friend at the moment.

59:29.715 --> 59:33.481
My mother's gonna marry that philanderer
if we don't do something right now.

59:36.955 --> 59:38.445
Please.

59:38.624 --> 59:41.559
I'm just trying to do
what's best for my mother.

59:41.727 --> 59:44.423
I could really use your help.

59:45.430 --> 59:47.762
Arizona?

01:00:07.953 --> 01:00:10.751
Hey. Hey.

01:00:12.724 --> 01:00:14.157
I'm gonna stop, okay?

01:00:14.326 --> 01:00:16.692
Stop where?

01:00:16.862 --> 01:00:19.524
I don't know. I was thinking
we could camp out tonight.

01:00:19.698 --> 01:00:21.165
You know, under the stars.

01:00:21.333 --> 01:00:23.358
I've got a couple sleeping bags
in the back.

01:00:23.535 --> 01:00:24.661
Camp out?

01:00:24.836 --> 01:00:27.964
I don't wanna be raped
by some sex-crazed trucker.

01:00:31.810 --> 01:00:36.304
Come on. Why don't you drive? For real.

01:00:47.626 --> 01:00:49.116
I know about fat camp.

01:00:50.762 --> 01:00:52.286
It's okay.

01:00:52.464 --> 01:00:56.457
I was a chunky kid too. Believe me,
I know exactly what you went through.

01:00:56.635 --> 01:00:58.626
It's awful.

01:01:01.907 --> 01:01:03.807
Just be honest with me.

01:01:11.116 --> 01:01:17.214
I'm afraid to drive because
my father was killed in a car accident.

01:01:17.389 --> 01:01:19.050
Okay?

01:01:21.993 --> 01:01:23.927
I'm sorry.

01:01:41.446 --> 01:01:43.641
-This is pretty great, huh?
-Oh, yeah.

01:01:43.815 --> 01:01:46.181
If you consider great
having a sciatica flare-up...

01:01:46.351 --> 01:01:48.512
...while being eaten alive by mosquitoes.

01:01:48.687 --> 01:01:51.019
Don't be such a baby.

01:01:52.290 --> 01:01:55.691
I can't believe
you've never been camping before.

01:01:55.861 --> 01:02:00.127
I've been camping.
Just never without adult supervision.

01:02:02.901 --> 01:02:05.802
My father took me once when I was 10.

01:02:06.838 --> 01:02:13.141
Actually, that's the first time I heard
the seductive song of the astronomy siren.

01:02:14.045 --> 01:02:15.876
That's cool.

01:02:16.047 --> 01:02:21.314
My dad was too busy getting hammered and
puking on his shoes to take me anywhere.

01:02:23.221 --> 01:02:25.485
His loss.

01:02:39.671 --> 01:02:43.232
I just feel so insignificant out here.

01:02:44.376 --> 01:02:46.310
Don't you?

01:02:47.245 --> 01:02:50.112
Sometimes.

01:02:50.282 --> 01:02:55.413
But then other times
I feel totally connected to the universe...

01:02:55.587 --> 01:03:00.547
...like a part of something
greater than myself, or even this planet.

01:03:00.725 --> 01:03:05.355
That despite what happens to all of us
when we shuffle off this mortal coil...

01:03:05.530 --> 01:03:07.555
...the universe will still be here.

01:03:12.771 --> 01:03:14.602
That was beautiful.

01:03:14.773 --> 01:03:18.675
Yes, well, I'm paraphrasing
Leonard Nimoy, of course.

01:03:28.453 --> 01:03:30.182
Are you okay?

01:03:30.355 --> 01:03:32.346
What do you mean?

01:03:33.425 --> 01:03:35.791
Your teeth are chattering.

01:03:35.961 --> 01:03:37.155
They are?

01:03:37.329 --> 01:03:39.422
Are you cold?

01:03:39.598 --> 01:03:42.123
Not particularly.

01:03:45.837 --> 01:03:47.600
Is that a permanent retainer?

01:03:48.907 --> 01:03:51.569
-Yeah.
-I have one too.

01:03:51.743 --> 01:03:53.608
See?

01:03:55.380 --> 01:03:58.838
They say you're supposed to
keep it in for life, you know?

01:03:59.017 --> 01:04:02.475
Well, that's what my orthodontist said.

01:04:29.881 --> 01:04:31.508
Hey.

01:04:34.185 --> 01:04:37.086
So ready to go?

01:04:48.466 --> 01:04:50.229
-Hold on!
-Come on.

01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:53.328
Jeffrey?

01:04:53.505 --> 01:04:56.269
Jeffrey, what are we doing?
She's in a meeting.

01:04:56.441 --> 01:04:58.409
Not for long.

01:05:01.212 --> 01:05:05.148
Sorry to interrupt.
I have an urgent message for Maya Sinclair.

01:05:05.317 --> 01:05:07.308
I'm Maya Sinclair. What is it?

01:05:07.485 --> 01:05:10.386
Does the name Mert Rosenbloom
mean anything to you?

01:05:10.555 --> 01:05:12.955
What happened? Is he all right?

01:05:13.124 --> 01:05:17.720
I don't know, you tell me. You're the one
who's been sleeping with him.

01:05:19.064 --> 01:05:22.625
You sick bastard. Bob, call Security.

01:05:22.801 --> 01:05:23.825
Me, sick?

01:05:24.002 --> 01:05:27.267
You're the one having an affair with
a man who's engaged to another woman.

01:05:27.439 --> 01:05:30.272
Mert Rosenbloom is not my lover,
you psycho. He's my father.

01:05:36.581 --> 01:05:38.811
The last time I saw Mert,
I was 12 years old.

01:05:38.984 --> 01:05:43.318
He dropped me off for soccer practice
one day and never came back.

01:05:43.488 --> 01:05:47.185
At the time, my mom told me
that he just wasn't ready to be a father.

01:05:47.359 --> 01:05:51.955
And when I was older, she told me
that he suffered from depression.

01:05:52.130 --> 01:05:54.121
He started emailing me
a couple years ago...

01:05:54.299 --> 01:05:56.563
...telling me that
he'd turned his life around...

01:05:56.735 --> 01:05:59.499
...and that he'd become
some sort of motivational speaker.

01:05:59.671 --> 01:06:03.368
Actually, I think
he prefers the term "success coach."

01:06:05.010 --> 01:06:09.538
He said that he met this really great woman
and he wanted me to meet her.

01:06:09.714 --> 01:06:11.875
So when I didn't respond, I guess...

01:06:12.050 --> 01:06:15.076
...he just figured
he'd rather say he didn't have any kids...

01:06:15.253 --> 01:06:17.585
...than admit that he'd messed up so bad.

01:06:17.756 --> 01:06:19.485
Maybe I should have responded.

01:06:19.658 --> 01:06:21.182
I don't know.

01:06:21.359 --> 01:06:25.159
I guess I just never figured out
a way to forgive him.

01:06:36.608 --> 01:06:38.269
We're here.

01:06:41.112 --> 01:06:46.243
Well, I feel sorry for the poor guy.

01:06:46.418 --> 01:06:49.319
But the truth must be revealed.

01:06:49.487 --> 01:06:53.480
Wait a minute. You still want your mom
to break up with him?

01:06:53.658 --> 01:06:55.250
The man lied to her, Nora.

01:06:55.427 --> 01:06:58.396
-He was ashamed.
-A lie is a lie.

01:06:58.563 --> 01:07:01.760
Ugh. Wait a minute.
So you've never told a lied before?

01:07:01.933 --> 01:07:02.957
Absolutely not.

01:07:03.134 --> 01:07:06.695
That's a lie right there.
Remember fat camp?

01:07:06.871 --> 01:07:09.169
That's different.

01:07:12.811 --> 01:07:15.279
What about Allison?

01:07:15.447 --> 01:07:16.880
What about her?

01:07:17.048 --> 01:07:21.382
I know there is no Allison.
Mert told me all about it.

01:07:21.553 --> 01:07:23.487
And you believed him?

01:07:23.655 --> 01:07:26.522
The man will stop at nothing
to bring me down. Don't you see?

01:07:26.691 --> 01:07:30.525
That's what this whole crusade is all about,
saving my mother from that monster.

01:07:30.695 --> 01:07:33.789
You're not trying to save your mom,
you're trying to sabotage her...

01:07:33.965 --> 01:07:35.899
...because you're too afraid to grow up.

01:07:36.067 --> 01:07:38.467
And I was just a pawn
in your sick little plan.

01:07:38.636 --> 01:07:42.163
You were not a pawn.
You were an essential component.

01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:45.366
An essential component?

01:07:46.244 --> 01:07:48.235
Is that what you think of me?

01:07:48.413 --> 01:07:50.347
Yeah. What's wrong with that?

01:07:51.816 --> 01:07:53.943
You're such an asshole.

01:07:54.119 --> 01:07:55.347
Get out.

01:07:56.955 --> 01:08:00.015
-Okay, Nora, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.
-Get out!

01:08:34.292 --> 01:08:36.020
Morning, Jeffrey.

01:08:36.194 --> 01:08:37.752
Oh, Mert.

01:08:37.929 --> 01:08:40.523
That's my name, don't wear it out.

01:08:40.698 --> 01:08:42.723
What are you doing up?

01:08:43.667 --> 01:08:45.135
Cut the bullshit.

01:08:46.805 --> 01:08:50.036
I know where you've been,
and you shouldn't have gone there.

01:08:50.207 --> 01:08:54.109
Well, you shouldn't have
told Nora about Allison.

01:08:54.279 --> 01:08:56.872
Stay away from me, you maniac.

01:08:57.048 --> 01:08:58.276
I'll call the police.

01:08:58.448 --> 01:09:00.679
Go ahead. It'll be over
by the time they get here.

01:09:00.852 --> 01:09:03.649
I'll scream. My mother's not gonna
stand idly by while you murder me.

01:09:06.124 --> 01:09:08.058
Scared you.

01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:17.497
Come on. Ha-ha-ha-ha.

01:09:18.502 --> 01:09:20.265
Don't make me hurt you, mama's boy.

01:09:20.438 --> 01:09:24.238
Bring it on, old man, if you can
even see me with your glaucoma.

01:09:24.408 --> 01:09:25.774
Whoa, whoa! Woop!

01:09:33.017 --> 01:09:35.178
You ever been in a fight before, crybaby?

01:09:35.353 --> 01:09:37.014
As a matter of fact, I have. Huh? Huh?

01:09:47.799 --> 01:09:50.461
What the hell is going on here?
What's going on?

01:09:50.635 --> 01:09:52.603
What? Huh?

01:09:52.770 --> 01:09:54.169
-He started it.
-I did not.

01:09:54.339 --> 01:09:55.431
-Did too.
-I did not!

01:09:55.607 --> 01:09:56.869
-Did too.
-I did not!

01:09:57.041 --> 01:09:59.601
Stop! Will somebody please...

01:10:01.713 --> 01:10:04.648
...in God's name,
tell me what is going on here?

01:10:05.316 --> 01:10:09.446
Mert lied to you, Mother.
He has a daughter, and I have proof.

01:10:10.788 --> 01:10:12.653
Mert, what is he talking about?

01:10:12.824 --> 01:10:14.621
Well, I mean-- I was--

01:10:14.792 --> 01:10:18.193
I was going to-- I was going to tell you.

01:10:18.363 --> 01:10:21.457
Okay, forget it. Forget it. Here.
You can take your ring back, Mert.

01:10:21.633 --> 01:10:23.601
-Yes.
-I'm not gonna take it. I am not--

01:10:23.768 --> 01:10:26.737
-Jan, I am not-- I am not taking the ring.
-And good luck.

01:10:26.905 --> 01:10:30.363
-Jan, your son--
-Don't talk to me like that.

01:10:30.541 --> 01:10:35.877
Don't you dare say that about my son!
Okay, that's it, Mert. I've had it!

01:10:36.047 --> 01:10:37.878
Put him on a leash!

01:10:46.991 --> 01:10:50.222
I know it wasn't easy for you
to break it off with him, Mother...

01:10:50.395 --> 01:10:53.694
...but take comfort in the fact
that you did the right thing.

01:10:53.865 --> 01:10:56.959
No one should have
to cohabitate with a liar.

01:10:59.537 --> 01:11:00.697
Oh, and...

01:11:00.872 --> 01:11:04.740
...I was thinking that maybe for dinner
tonight we could do something special.

01:11:04.909 --> 01:11:06.376
Jeffrey?

01:11:10.782 --> 01:11:12.875
I want you to move out.

01:11:14.519 --> 01:11:15.713
What?

01:11:15.887 --> 01:11:19.914
You have two weeks, Jeffrey,
to find your own place. I'm sorry.

01:11:20.758 --> 01:11:23.226
No, I'm not leaving. You can't make me.

01:11:23.394 --> 01:11:24.725
Yes, I can, Jeffrey.

01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:29.022
All right, fine, I'm sorry.
I'll be better. I promise.

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:30.633
It's too late for that, Jeffrey.

01:11:30.802 --> 01:11:34.533
No, look, you're in a state of shock,
you don't know what you're saying.

01:11:34.706 --> 01:11:39.166
I know exactly what I'm saying.
Now, please let go of me. Let go of me.

01:11:41.546 --> 01:11:43.878
Fine. You want me to leave?

01:11:44.048 --> 01:11:47.108
I don't need your pity fortnight.
I'll leave right now.

01:11:47.285 --> 01:11:51.551
But I want you to know you're right.
This is all your fault.

01:11:51.723 --> 01:11:56.820
That I turned out this way,
that you used me to replace Dad.

01:12:01.032 --> 01:12:02.465
Oh.

01:12:05.603 --> 01:12:08.037
Oh. Oh, dear.

01:12:10.241 --> 01:12:12.106
Here.

01:12:48.413 --> 01:12:49.812
What do you want?

01:12:51.282 --> 01:12:55.116
Actually, I'd like an application
for employment.

01:12:55.286 --> 01:12:58.153
I'm looking for work,
and I recalled you mentioning...

01:12:58.322 --> 01:13:01.416
...that the benefits package
here was respectable.

01:13:01.592 --> 01:13:04.720
Hey, Richard, can you
bring this guy out an application?

01:13:04.896 --> 01:13:06.693
The manager will be right with you.

01:13:08.399 --> 01:13:11.835
Hey, if you wanna just fill this out
for me right there--

01:13:13.304 --> 01:13:15.704
So how are things?

01:13:15.873 --> 01:13:18.865
Can you cover for me?
I'm gonna take off early.

01:13:19.043 --> 01:13:22.706
Nora, look, at least give me
the opportunity to explain.

01:13:24.348 --> 01:13:27.044
Okay, but what's to explain?

01:13:27.218 --> 01:13:31.678
That you're an immature man-child
who used me in your demented plot...

01:13:31.856 --> 01:13:36.418
...to squeeze your mom's boyfriend out of
her life so that you could win her back?

01:13:36.594 --> 01:13:40.655
Oh, yeah, and your long-distance girlfriend
is imaginary.

01:13:40.832 --> 01:13:42.891
Does that about wrap it up there?

01:13:43.067 --> 01:13:44.932
You're sick, bro.

01:13:45.103 --> 01:13:48.436
It sounds a lot worse when you string it
all together like that, Richard.

01:13:48.606 --> 01:13:50.198
-You can't go back there.
-Nora!

01:13:50.374 --> 01:13:53.002
Don't even bother
filling out that application.

01:13:54.512 --> 01:13:56.377
Where's your car?

01:13:57.715 --> 01:14:02.084
I sold it. I'm taking a bus
to Austin next Sunday.

01:14:02.253 --> 01:14:05.916
Nora, please. Give me another chance.

01:14:07.024 --> 01:14:08.048
Why?

01:14:08.226 --> 01:14:12.026
You don't care about me.
You don't care about anybody.

01:14:16.567 --> 01:14:19.536
Do you have any idea
how much pain you caused your mom?

01:14:20.371 --> 01:14:21.998
Do you?

01:14:22.173 --> 01:14:25.267
All she wanted was a life,
and you went and you messed it up...

01:14:25.443 --> 01:14:27.502
...because you're too afraid
to live your own.

01:14:27.678 --> 01:14:29.703
There's no way
I'm letting you do that to me.

01:14:29.881 --> 01:14:34.545
I'm chasing my dream.
I'm taking my shot, okay?

01:14:35.887 --> 01:14:38.447
And if your mom knew
what was good for her, she would too.

01:14:38.623 --> 01:14:41.183
And she'd kick you out
of that goddamn house.

01:14:41.359 --> 01:14:43.054
She did.

01:14:45.630 --> 01:14:50.226
Oh. So, what?
I guess you need a place to crash?

01:14:52.236 --> 01:14:56.002
God, you're so pathetic.

01:16:37.942 --> 01:16:41.173
Mm. Nummy-num-nums. Ahh.

01:16:41.345 --> 01:16:42.403
Come on.

01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:46.744
Thanks for coming.
I hope we can let bygones be bygones.

01:16:47.952 --> 01:16:51.945
I just spent 500 dollars
to get you out of jail.

01:16:52.123 --> 01:16:54.717
Then we're off to a good start.

01:16:57.928 --> 01:17:01.659
Well, now, as you know,
there isn't much room.

01:17:01.832 --> 01:17:04.164
-And there's only one bed.
-All right.

01:17:04.335 --> 01:17:07.827
Are you sure you're gonna be okay
sleeping on the floor?

01:17:11.042 --> 01:17:13.510
I was thinking
you would sleep on the floor.

01:17:13.678 --> 01:17:15.908
I've got spina bifida.

01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:18.071
I've got osteoporosis.

01:17:18.249 --> 01:17:20.012
Well, I'm allergic to dust.

01:17:20.184 --> 01:17:23.119
I'm 91 fucking years old.

01:17:28.492 --> 01:17:30.551
Seymour, you awake?

01:17:31.062 --> 01:17:32.962
I've been such a wiener.

01:17:33.130 --> 01:17:34.791
What are you doing in my bed?

01:17:34.965 --> 01:17:38.628
Do you think there's any way for me
to make redress for the things I've done?

01:17:39.503 --> 01:17:41.596
It's 4:00 in the morning.

01:17:41.772 --> 01:17:43.330
I need to know, Seymour.

01:17:43.507 --> 01:17:47.637
Can I be redeemed
for all the suffering I've caused?

01:17:48.979 --> 01:17:52.745
If you're looking for some wise,
pithy bit of advice...

01:17:53.517 --> 01:17:58.614
...that only an old man with
a lifetime of experience can give you...

01:17:58.789 --> 01:18:01.349
...you're barking up the wrong tree.

01:18:07.365 --> 01:18:10.163
What I can tell you...

01:18:10.334 --> 01:18:16.637
...is the love we give away
is the only love we keep.

01:18:18.142 --> 01:18:22.135
That's actually wise and pithy, Seymour.

01:18:22.313 --> 01:18:27.649
I got it off an old Deepak Chopra calendar.
I think it was September.

01:18:41.232 --> 01:18:42.631
Wake up, old man.

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:44.961
What in the name of Mike is going on?

01:18:45.136 --> 01:18:46.262
I have a plan...

01:18:46.437 --> 01:18:49.338
-...to restore order to the universe.
-Huh?

01:18:49.507 --> 01:18:51.668
I'm getting my mother
back together with Mert.

01:18:53.878 --> 01:18:55.937
You're wearing my suit.

01:19:00.584 --> 01:19:03.610
Slow down!
I don't know how!

01:19:19.203 --> 01:19:22.036
<i>"My dearest Jan, I've taken some time...</i>

01:19:22.206 --> 01:19:24.606
<i>...out of my incredibly
successful schedule...</i>

01:19:24.775 --> 01:19:27.801
<i>...to think about recent events,
and I've come to a conclusion.</i>

01:19:27.978 --> 01:19:32.608
<i>I was wrong. Yes, I, Mert,
the meat magician, screwed up.</i>

01:19:32.783 --> 01:19:37.117
<i>I just want you to know that I'm sorry,
and I know that Jeffrey is sorry.</i>

01:19:37.288 --> 01:19:39.654
<i>What he did was selfish and childish.</i>

01:19:39.824 --> 01:19:44.124
<i>He was afraid to live his own life, afraid
that by sharing you he would lose you...</i>

01:19:44.295 --> 01:19:47.321
<i>...but he loves you
and he wants us to be together.</i>

01:19:47.498 --> 01:19:51.332
<i>Please, meet me at Brentfield Park
tomorrow at 3.</i>

01:19:51.502 --> 01:19:54.198
<i>All my love, Mert. "</i>

01:19:56.841 --> 01:20:00.504
<i>"Dear Mert, you're right.
Jeffrey should be on a leash.</i>

01:20:00.678 --> 01:20:04.614
<i>Meet me at Brentfield Park tomorrow
at 3. Love, Jan. "</i>

01:20:04.782 --> 01:20:06.477
Yes!

01:20:14.525 --> 01:20:17.119
Damn it, where is she?

01:20:17.294 --> 01:20:19.888
Jeffrey, Jeffrey...

01:20:21.165 --> 01:20:23.759
...no matter what happens
from here on out...

01:20:23.934 --> 01:20:28.098
...I want you to know just one thing:
I'm proud of you.

01:20:30.274 --> 01:20:32.572
Subject in motion.

01:20:34.945 --> 01:20:37.243
<i>Hi.
Hi, you wanted to see me?</i>

01:20:37.414 --> 01:20:41.851
Yes, yes, I did. I got your note.

01:20:42.086 --> 01:20:45.487
-Oh. My what? My note?
-Ooh.

01:20:45.656 --> 01:20:47.180
-Yeah.
-No, wait a minute.

01:20:47.358 --> 01:20:49.326
I mean, you sent me a note. It's--

01:20:49.493 --> 01:20:52.121
No, you wrote me a note. But, anyway.

01:20:52.296 --> 01:20:54.764
Anyway, right, forget it.

01:20:54.932 --> 01:20:56.991
<i>Jan, no, wait, wait, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

01:20:57.668 --> 01:21:01.229
Look, I know I should've come clean
about everything...

01:21:01.405 --> 01:21:03.873
...but I just--
I was afraid I was gonna lose you.

01:21:05.209 --> 01:21:08.667
That sounds like an excuse,
but it's not, it's true.

01:21:08.846 --> 01:21:11.314
Look, I....

01:21:15.753 --> 01:21:20.588
I have been in love with you
since the first moment I saw you.

01:21:21.458 --> 01:21:22.618
Bingo.

01:21:25.362 --> 01:21:27.193
What? Damn it!

01:21:27.364 --> 01:21:29.798
Can't they do anything right?

01:21:29.967 --> 01:21:31.025
What's happen--? What?

01:21:34.638 --> 01:21:36.105
Oh! Oh.

01:21:36.273 --> 01:21:37.968
Oh, my God.

01:21:38.142 --> 01:21:40.303
Lovely day for a stroll.

01:21:40.477 --> 01:21:42.411
Leave me alone, okay?

01:21:42.580 --> 01:21:45.378
-Come on, give Mert another chance.
-What?

01:21:45.549 --> 01:21:49.986
Look, I know I haven't always been
the world's greatest son, but he loves you.

01:21:50.154 --> 01:21:54.284
And I know you love him too. Just give me
the opportunity to make things right.

01:21:55.826 --> 01:21:59.694
Come on, I really am sorry.
For everything I've done.

01:21:59.863 --> 01:22:01.490
-Since when?
-Since you met Mert.

01:22:01.665 --> 01:22:04.463
-But what about before that?
-What are you referring to?

01:22:04.635 --> 01:22:08.036
Well, I am referring to the fact
that you haven't been honest with me...

01:22:08.205 --> 01:22:09.729
...a day in your life, Jeffrey.

01:22:09.907 --> 01:22:12.273
-And you've been honest with me?
-No, I have not...

01:22:12.443 --> 01:22:14.638
...and it just makes me absolutely sick.

01:22:14.812 --> 01:22:17.007
To think that
our whole entire relationship...

01:22:17.181 --> 01:22:20.116
...has been based on a foundation
of lies and self-deception--

01:22:20.284 --> 01:22:22.252
This is no time
for a trip down memory lane.

01:22:22.419 --> 01:22:24.580
It's not about us.
It's about you and Mert.

01:22:24.755 --> 01:22:29.158
It's all about us.
It's all about where we went wrong.

01:22:30.327 --> 01:22:34.229
-Don't you walk away from me, young lady.
-Don't you talk to me like that, young man.

01:22:34.398 --> 01:22:35.626
I'm your mother.

01:22:35.799 --> 01:22:39.826
I know. That's why I want you to be happy.
Don't you get it?

01:22:40.004 --> 01:22:43.599
-That's why I want you to be with Mert.
-You can't handle it.

01:22:43.774 --> 01:22:46.834
-What did you say?
-I said, you can't handle it.

01:22:47.411 --> 01:22:52.644
I'm sorry, I didn't understand you because
the word "can't" isn't in my vocabulary.

01:22:56.987 --> 01:23:00.150
Come here. Come here.

01:23:00.324 --> 01:23:01.484
Come on.

01:23:10.134 --> 01:23:14.230
Come on, people.
Can't we put all this behind us?

01:23:19.043 --> 01:23:21.534
-What--? What do we--?
-Come on.

01:23:36.193 --> 01:23:37.490
Tsk.

01:23:54.378 --> 01:23:57.370
All right, well,
sweetheart, please drive safe, okay?

01:24:01.185 --> 01:24:04.086
-Do you need any cash?
-No, thanks.

01:24:04.955 --> 01:24:07.788
You're a good man, Mert Rosenbloom.

01:24:13.130 --> 01:24:14.859
Take care of my mother for me.

01:24:15.032 --> 01:24:16.659
I will.

01:24:28.045 --> 01:24:29.774
Bye.

01:24:59.309 --> 01:25:00.867
What the hell is this?

01:25:22.766 --> 01:25:25.428
What is this? I'm on a schedule here.

01:25:26.770 --> 01:25:27.759
Jeffrey.

01:25:27.938 --> 01:25:30.429
-Is he your boyfriend?
-What the hell are you doing?

01:25:30.607 --> 01:25:33.474
Trying to get this contraption to work.

01:25:33.644 --> 01:25:36.238
-You're making a scene.
-Have you ever seen a shoddier...

01:25:36.413 --> 01:25:38.779
...piece of equipment?
I may be forced to litigate.

01:25:38.949 --> 01:25:42.476
-Move this vehicle or I'm calling the cops.
-I refuse to move an inch, sir...

01:25:42.653 --> 01:25:45.121
...until the young lady agrees
to come with me.

01:25:45.289 --> 01:25:46.881
Oh, my God.

01:25:47.057 --> 01:25:48.957
-You're insane.
-No, I'm not.

01:25:50.761 --> 01:25:52.888
I made a backup copy.

01:25:56.300 --> 01:25:57.892
Look, Nora, you were right.

01:25:58.068 --> 01:26:01.765
I was an asshole.
I'm sorry about the way I treated you.

01:26:01.939 --> 01:26:04.737
It's just because I liked you so much.

01:26:04.908 --> 01:26:07.468
What are you talking about?

01:26:08.478 --> 01:26:13.472
You're smart,
you're intrepid, you're "funky."

01:26:13.650 --> 01:26:17.051
I was just so terrified of being hurt...

01:26:17.221 --> 01:26:18.745
...I couldn't admit it.

01:26:21.024 --> 01:26:22.787
But I'm not afraid anymore.

01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:25.851
Now I'm late, asshole.
Move that piece of shit.

01:26:26.029 --> 01:26:28.361
-Come make me, you philistine!
Ah....

01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:32.766
Can you give me a chance?

01:26:32.936 --> 01:26:35.404
Come with me?

01:26:39.243 --> 01:26:40.801
Get out of the way!

01:26:42.446 --> 01:26:45.313
You sure you know
how to drive that thing?

01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:04.094
Sorry.

01:27:04.268 --> 01:27:07.260
<i>Dear Lunar Space Institute
of Austin, Texas:</i>

01:27:07.437 --> 01:27:10.804
<i>A night of romance beneath the stars
with a plucky songstress...</i>

01:27:10.974 --> 01:27:14.000
<i>...has reawakened me
to the majesty of the cosmos.</i>

01:27:14.177 --> 01:27:17.112
<i>I have come to realize
that we are, all of us, connected.</i>

01:27:17.281 --> 01:27:21.308
<i>And that, like the universe itself,
our dreams know no bounds.</i>

01:27:21.485 --> 01:27:26.115
<i>My dream is to be an astronomer.
I look forward to seeing you in the fall.</i>

01:27:26.290 --> 01:27:29.054
<i>And trust that I will not be assigned
a roommate this time...</i>

01:27:29.226 --> 01:27:34.007
<i>...per my doctor's request.
Yours, Jeffrey Mannus.</i>
