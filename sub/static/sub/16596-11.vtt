Okay. Pink, text green.

This alluring brunette.

Alluring? Been a long time

00:47.248 --> 00:49.915
Marlowe Sullivan,

00:49.917 --> 00:51.850
I have been scouring
Southern California

00:51.852 --> 00:54.253

00:54.255 --> 00:58.057

01:05.032 --> 01:06.365
Would you look at that?

01:06.367 --> 01:08.600
One minute, I'm snapping
photos for my daughter,

01:08.602 --> 01:10.502
and the next,
I'm a world-class model.

01:10.504 --> 01:12.638
Ain't that a kick
in the camera.

01:14.508 --> 01:17.009
Yeah. Mom, that's a scam.

01:17.011 --> 01:19.378
-Oh...
-I mean, real talent agents

01:19.380 --> 01:22.548
don't just discover
people in malls like that.

01:22.550 --> 01:25.918
Plus, it's highly
unlikely that--

01:25.920 --> 01:28.620
Highly unlikely that what?

01:30.724 --> 01:33.392
-No, just that--
-No, no. No, no.

01:33.394 --> 01:36.628

I... We didn't know that.

04:14.755 --> 04:19.024
-You don't look homeless.
-Willow! (nervous chuckle)

04:19.026 --> 04:20.592
Uh, what she means

04:20.594 --> 04:24.463
is you look home... ful.

04:26.634 --> 04:28.533
(nervous laugh)

04:28.535 --> 04:30.969
I'm making this
so much weirder, huh?

04:30.971 --> 04:33.305
No, no, no, uh...

04:33.307 --> 04:37.609
It's cool. Uh, I don't
look like what people
think of as homeless,

04:37.611 --> 04:41.113
but I don't have a home,
so that kinda makes me homeless.

04:41.115 --> 04:44.549
-I'm so sorry.
-So, no home.

04:44.551 --> 04:47.552
-How did that happen?
-Willow, seriously! (whispering)

04:47.554 --> 04:51.723
It's cool. Well, no one
sets out to be homeless.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.825
Sometimes,
life takes you there.

04:53.827 --> 04:57.429
Growing up, my family life
was... complicated.

04:57.431 --> 05:00.465
So, as soon as
I turned 18, I bolted.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.435
That must have been
really hard for you.

05:03.437 --> 05:06.571
Well, I'm not gonna lie,
it's no picnic.

05:06.573 --> 05:09.641
But I'll be fine. Things are
gonna come together soon.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.576
I can feel it.

05:11.578 --> 05:14.012
-I'll see you guys tomorrow?
-Both: Yeah.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.750
-Bye.
-Bye.

05:20.521 --> 05:23.155
Both:
Mom! Mom!

05:23.157 --> 05:26.992
(sighs) We just FaceGabbed
with Dad in Wisconsin.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.094
-And we have awesome news.
-Hm...

05:29.096 --> 05:33.065
Did he give you
an update on the rebuild
of the house you two destroyed?

05:34.768 --> 05:39.771
Um... we prefer the term
unintentionally deconstructed.

05:39.773 --> 05:41.606
Joey:
Yeah.

05:41.608 --> 05:45.277
Dad said that
the new roof is on!

05:45.279 --> 05:47.045
(laughs) You know
what that means, Mom?

05:47.047 --> 05:50.115
Yeah. That we're four walls
short of a house.

05:50.117 --> 05:54.686
Yes, but you said,
and I quote:

05:54.688 --> 05:57.856
"Oh! What?

05:57.858 --> 06:01.960
I am not giving you two
an allowance when there's
no roof over my head."

06:03.630 --> 06:07.532
And now there's a roof,
so you owe us our allowance.

06:07.534 --> 06:10.535
Make it rain, woman.
Make it rain.

06:10.537 --> 06:13.505
All right. Well, you two
caught me on a good day,

06:13.507 --> 06:15.741
so I will reinstate
your allowance.

06:15.743 --> 06:16.708
(gasps)

06:16.710 --> 06:18.043
(both gasping)

06:18.045 --> 06:19.911
She never
actually said that.

06:19.913 --> 06:23.248
-We just made it up!
-I can't believe that worked!

06:24.385 --> 06:26.218
Oh, I know I didn't say that.

06:26.220 --> 06:29.154
But Mama's about
to have model money.

06:30.691 --> 06:33.925
Enjoy your allowance,
but just know that
whenever I look at you,

06:33.927 --> 06:36.628
there will always be a layer
of anger and disappointment.

06:38.499 --> 06:40.065
-Seems fair.
-I get that.

06:41.568 --> 06:44.669
Oh, money,
I've missed you so much.

06:44.671 --> 06:47.239
You know what
we should do, man?
We should go to the movies.

06:47.241 --> 06:49.941
Oh, yeah.<i> Custodians</i>

We can only afford one.

-What? Uh!

09:22.596 --> 09:23.728
Hey!

09:23.730 --> 09:25.597
We wanted to set up
a pop-a-shot booth

09:25.599 --> 09:27.165
to raise money to help Eddy.

09:27.167 --> 09:30.168
The mall said we could
if we promised to keep Joey

09:30.170 --> 09:32.737
from painting himself silver
and acting like a statue,

09:32.739 --> 09:35.240
which, apparently,
happens all the time.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.542
Yeah, and, uh,
not for money.

09:37.544 --> 09:41.446
He does it for "art."

09:41.448 --> 09:44.616
-Crowd goes wild!
-Hey, Maddie. Hey, Willow.

09:44.618 --> 09:46.918
-Both: Hey, Val.
-Have you seen Parker?

09:46.920 --> 09:49.387
Yeah. He was, uh,
with Joey

09:49.389 --> 09:52.190
dressed like a four-year-old,
holding a giant lollipop.

09:55.562 --> 09:57.329
Never mind. I'm not
looking for him anymore.

09:59.900 --> 10:03.201
"Help fight homelessness."
That's cool.

10:03.203 --> 10:04.803
What made you think to do this?

10:04.805 --> 10:07.973
Um, we actually have
a friend who is homeless.

10:07.975 --> 10:09.374
Yeah, he plays
guitar at the mall.

10:09.376 --> 10:12.611
-Eddy from The Cove?
-Yeah. Do you know him?

10:12.613 --> 10:15.080

built is about to fall apart.

-Pssht!
-Our pop-a-shot?

10:35.802 --> 10:39.237
(scoffs, laughs)
I tightened every bolt myself.

10:39.239 --> 10:42.774
But did you calculate
the center of gravity

10:42.776 --> 10:44.409
to maximize
load-bearing strength?

10:45.679 --> 10:47.579
Maximize the gravity
of what a what now?

10:47.581 --> 10:50.248
(laughs) It's okay.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.017
BOOMS has all
the tools you need.

-Uh, I think we're okay.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.027
Mom, what are you doing?

11:36.029 --> 11:38.797
Oh, just warming up
before my big photo sesh.

11:38.799 --> 11:41.199
Marlowe should be
here any minute. (chuckles)

11:42.536 --> 11:44.869
What are you doing
with your face?

11:44.871 --> 11:49.908
Oh. So, I did some research
on the World Wide Web.

11:49.910 --> 11:53.011
There are three faces
that every model must master.

11:53.013 --> 11:55.013
-Mm-hm.
-There's pouty face.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.981
There's flirty face.

11:56.983 --> 11:59.751
There's pouty-flirty face.
(grunts)

11:59.753 --> 12:03.088
Okay. Um, Mom,

12:03.090 --> 12:05.724
I'm really happy that
you're so excited about this,

12:05.726 --> 12:08.560
but be careful that
you're not getting scammed.

12:08.562 --> 12:11.563
-Oh...
-I mean, why are they doing
the photo shoot in our house?

12:11.565 --> 12:15.233
Oh, Marlowe says
that models sparkle more
in their natural surroundings.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.736
Or she's a con artist who
doesn't really have a studio.

12:17.738 --> 12:19.370
-Oh...
-Mom, look at me.

12:19.372 --> 12:21.506
This is my
"under no circumstances

12:21.508 --> 12:23.908
are you to give
that woman any money" face.

12:23.910 --> 12:26.277
Funny, it looks an awful lot
like your condescending face.

12:26.279 --> 12:28.279
-That's because it is.
-Oh...

12:28.281 --> 12:30.949
You know what?
I can do condescending.

12:30.951 --> 12:32.350
(chuckles)

12:32.352 --> 12:34.986
Nope, still alluring.

12:36.056 --> 12:38.089
(upbeat dance music playing)

12:46.066 --> 12:48.933
(dance music continuing)

12:57.310 --> 13:00.678
(dance music continuing)

13:09.990 --> 13:13.491
(dance music continuing)

13:17.964 --> 13:20.064
So, you happy with
the shots you got, Marlowe?

13:20.066 --> 13:23.802
Happy? You are absolutely
ideal for this campaign.

13:23.804 --> 13:26.805
-(giggles)
-Now there's just the little
matter of the check.

13:26.807 --> 13:29.140
I knew it!

13:29.142 --> 13:33.011
There is absolutely no way
that my mother is
writing you a check.

13:33.013 --> 13:36.748
Of course not, sweetie.
I've written her a check.

13:36.750 --> 13:39.117
Here you go.
Worth every penny.

13:39.119 --> 13:42.086
Oh, thank you.
Great sesh today.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.790
Next time you're at The Cove,

13:45.792 --> 13:47.992
you're gonna see your face
on a billboard.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.594
Oh, thanks, Marlowe.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.162
Hey, I'll see you
at Fashion Week.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.231
(laughs)

13:55.502 --> 14:00.038
So... see, Liv?
Completely legit.

14:00.040 --> 14:03.975
I'm sorry.
I stand corrected.

14:03.977 --> 14:07.212
You look great, and it is
going to be a very beautiful ad.

14:07.214 --> 14:09.480
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

14:09.482 --> 14:12.050
Now, I've got a rack
full of clothes a face
full of makeup.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.451
You wanna play model
with Mama?

14:13.453 --> 14:15.620
I was starting to think
that you weren't gonna ask.

14:15.622 --> 14:18.857
-(both laugh)
-(upbeat dance music plays)

14:27.834 --> 14:29.667
Thanks for letting us in,
Ms. Karsch.

14:29.669 --> 14:34.505
Absolutely, Val. If you blow
anything up, I wasn't here.

14:34.507 --> 14:36.241
And thanks for the cookies.

14:37.878 --> 14:39.644
Look at this place.

14:39.646 --> 14:41.846
Can you believe Joey
and Parker go to school here?

14:41.848 --> 14:43.481
I feel so dumb.

14:43.483 --> 14:46.417
Hey, guys. Your problem
was you didn't have

14:46.419 --> 14:48.720
enough support between
your load-bearing beams.

14:50.824 --> 14:52.924
It's the same idea
as building a house.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.895
Did you draw all that
while we were talking?

14:56.897 --> 15:00.198
Yeah, it's what you
should have done
before you built the thing.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.000
It's called making a plan.

15:03.970 --> 15:07.772
-Are you trying to step to me?
-Okay, okay, okay.

15:07.774 --> 15:12.277
Easy, Willow. So could
we even build something
this elaborate?

15:12.279 --> 15:14.178
Yeah, sure.
We have all these parts

15:14.180 --> 15:17.115
from when we built a prototype
for a Mars shelter.

15:17.117 --> 15:18.683
We're just going
to recycle them.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.318
Shelter?

15:21.554 --> 15:23.454
Okay, so wait.

15:23.456 --> 15:25.089
Rather than build
a pop-a-shot,

15:25.091 --> 15:27.125
why don't we build
Eddy a place to stay

15:27.127 --> 15:29.227
until he gets
back on his feet?

15:29.229 --> 15:31.029
Maddie, that's a great idea!

15:31.031 --> 15:34.299
We... We could even use
these solar panels to power it.

15:34.301 --> 15:37.302
-Yeah!
-(whispers) Do you
know how to do that?

15:39.205 --> 15:41.773
-In my sleep.
-Yeah!

15:44.911 --> 15:48.446
Parker, I just figured out

15:48.448 --> 15:52.550
a better way for us
to go see<i> Custodians</i>
<i> of the Cosmos 2.</i>

15:52.552 --> 15:55.653
Whaa-chow!

15:58.725 --> 16:01.326
I can't even
begin to guess.

16:01.328 --> 16:04.662
We are both going
to squeeze

16:04.664 --> 16:07.932
into this
quadruple-XL tracksuit.

16:07.934 --> 16:12.236
Two young boys
become one very fat man.

16:12.238 --> 16:14.939
Who only needs one ticket.

16:14.941 --> 16:16.674
And a giant tub of popcorn!

16:17.644 --> 16:21.045
(funky music playing)

16:33.927 --> 16:36.194
(slurping)

16:50.377 --> 16:53.945
-Parker: How do we look?
-Large and in charge, Parker.

16:53.947 --> 16:56.981
Large and in charge.

16:56.983 --> 16:58.716
5-D, here we come!

16:58.718 --> 17:02.253
(funky music playing)

17:15.802 --> 17:18.403
(gasps)

17:18.405 --> 17:20.471
It smells like
a hamster cage in here.

17:20.473 --> 17:24.375
Yeah. Yeah, that's
probably because I had
hamsters in there earlier.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.878
Now, get down.

17:29.582 --> 17:32.984
(guffaws)

17:32.986 --> 17:36.254
Afternoon. Afternoon.

17:39.325 --> 17:40.825
Hello!

17:42.996 --> 17:47.698
One ticket for<i> Custodians</i>
<i>of the Cosmos 2.</i>

17:47.700 --> 17:51.302
5-D of course.

17:52.772 --> 17:56.040
-Don't I know you?
-Uh... (laughs)

17:56.042 --> 17:58.409
Me? No. No, no, no.

17:58.411 --> 18:02.280
Not me, I'm just a burly bloke

18:02.282 --> 18:07.318
looking for the air-conditioned
relief of a cool theater.

18:09.089 --> 18:10.555
Enjoy the show.

18:10.557 --> 18:14.125
Oh-ho-ho! Will do, will do.

18:14.127 --> 18:17.361
(laughs) Yeah!
We did it, Parker.

18:17.363 --> 18:20.631
Both:<i> ♪ We're going to 5-D</i>
<i> We're going to 5-D ♪</i>

18:20.633 --> 18:23.367
<i> ♪ We're going to 5-D ♪</i>

18:23.369 --> 18:24.535
-Whoa!
-Dang! No!

18:30.443 --> 18:32.443
(clears throat)

18:33.947 --> 18:38.382
And one large
popcorn, please.

18:39.319 --> 18:40.985
-Just stop.
-Ah...

18:44.390 --> 18:46.324
Ah! All right.

18:46.326 --> 18:48.826
It, uh, looks great.
I kind of think we're done.

18:48.828 --> 18:51.996
-Are we ready? Is it time?
-I believe it is.

18:51.998 --> 18:54.165
-Both: Bam! What?!
-Whoo!

18:54.167 --> 18:57.101
-Hey!
-(laughing)

18:57.103 --> 18:59.270
Hey, Miss Karsch.
Check it out.

18:59.272 --> 19:01.839
Wow! What is this?

19:01.841 --> 19:06.944
An eco-friendly,
tiny house made entirely
from repurposed materials.

19:06.946 --> 19:09.013
We built it for our friend
who is homeless,

19:09.015 --> 19:11.349
and we also got
the City of Santa Luego

19:11.351 --> 19:14.652
to allow temporary structures
like this in Oceanside Park.

19:16.289 --> 19:18.589
We had to promise
the Parks Department

19:18.591 --> 19:23.461
that we would keep Joey
from painting himself silver
and posing like a statue there.

19:23.463 --> 19:28.466
-Apparently, he does this
all around town.
-(laughing)

19:28.468 --> 19:31.335
You dated that guy.

19:31.337 --> 19:33.871
(laughing)

19:33.873 --> 19:37.608
Hey, I know of a grant program
that is looking
to fund innovative ideas.

19:37.610 --> 19:40.711
-I think this more
than qualifies.
-Seriously?

19:40.713 --> 19:42.346
That would be so awesome!

19:42.348 --> 19:44.348
And if you get the grant,
you could design and build

19:44.350 --> 19:46.384
tiny houses for homeless people
all over the country.

19:46.386 --> 19:50.454
Oh! Yeah, I mean, we're in.
What do we have to do?

19:50.456 --> 19:54.192
Because when Mad Dog
wants something done,
she gonna get it done!

19:55.495 --> 19:57.662
It's a simple application.

19:57.664 --> 19:59.764
But remind me
never to cross you.

20:01.467 --> 20:03.401
Dude! Did you hear that?

20:03.403 --> 20:07.572
We could build so many
more of these, and these
could help so many people!

20:07.574 --> 20:09.874
And here comes
the first one.

20:11.544 --> 20:14.378
-You ready?
-For you to take
your hands off my eyes?

20:14.380 --> 20:15.446
Yeah, a little bit.

20:16.816 --> 20:19.183
Hmm. What's this?

20:19.185 --> 20:21.752
This is your new home.

20:23.556 --> 20:26.090
I mean, for now. (chuckles)

20:26.092 --> 20:27.825
Really?

20:27.827 --> 20:30.394
We know times are hard,
so we wanted to make things

20:30.396 --> 20:32.897
a little easier for you
until you get back on your feet.

20:32.899 --> 20:36.867
Yeah. And, I mean, everybody
deserves a safe place to live.

20:36.869 --> 20:41.606
And people have to do whatever
they can to make that happen,
so... (sighs)

20:41.608 --> 20:44.609
I don't know what to say.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.883
<i> ♪ People say the best gifts ♪</i>

20:52.885 --> 20:56.387

21:17.877 --> 21:20.111
Oh, actually,
that reminds me.

21:24.884 --> 21:27.985
(all laugh)

21:32.058 --> 21:36.460
Okay! Marlowe said your ad would
be up on the billboard today.

21:36.462 --> 21:39.630
-This is so exciting!
-Joey?

21:42.135 --> 21:44.769
I'm a statue.

21:44.771 --> 21:48.606
Don't talk to me.

21:48.608 --> 21:52.143
Yeah, that's really
not gonna be a problem.

21:53.279 --> 21:56.347
Oh, no.
Looks like my ad's not up yet.

21:56.349 --> 21:59.350
Well, I guess I'll just go
get us a juice while
I still have my anonymity.

21:59.352 --> 22:01.986
Okay.

22:01.988 --> 22:04.121
(sighs)

22:04.123 --> 22:06.457
(gasps)

22:06.459 --> 22:08.092
Oh, no!

22:08.094 --> 22:11.028
No, no! Gross neck?

22:11.030 --> 22:14.532
No! Oh, Mom is gonna have her
heart broken if she sees this!

22:14.534 --> 22:19.837
(gasps) Is my neck gonna
look like that someday?!

22:19.839 --> 22:21.939
-(sobs)
-Hey, hey. Mom's coming.

22:21.941 --> 22:25.176
Oh! Ah!

22:25.178 --> 22:26.877
-Liv.
-Yeah?

22:26.879 --> 22:29.613
-What are you doing?
-Nothing. I was
just... relaxing.

22:29.615 --> 22:31.048
-Okay.
-Just, you know...

22:31.050 --> 22:32.950
-Here's your juice.
-Oh, thank you so much!

22:32.952 --> 22:35.386
You know what? We should
go drink these in the car.

22:35.388 --> 22:39.690
Oh! Oh, I think I forgot
to get my juice card punched.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.692
(moaning)

22:43.730 --> 22:45.363
Do you see this?

22:47.166 --> 22:48.566
I'm so sorry, Mom.

22:50.636 --> 22:52.436
Mom?

22:53.840 --> 22:54.939
Say something.

22:57.009 --> 22:58.075
I'm a model.

23:00.346 --> 23:03.013
I'm a professional model!

23:03.015 --> 23:04.482
(laughs) That's me!

23:04.484 --> 23:06.650
Hey! My gross neck is famous!

23:06.652 --> 23:08.552
(laughs) That's me!

23:10.256 --> 23:11.422
Look at us.

23:11.424 --> 23:13.224
The three Rooneys.

23:13.226 --> 23:14.725
