00:01.100 --> 00:03.200
Previously on NYPD Blue.

00:03.200 --> 00:05.300
You wanna come into the bedroom?

00:05.300 --> 00:07.300
The worst thing I could do
if I start worrying...

00:07.300 --> 00:11.100
is I could create exactly what I want to avoid
by making you feel claustrophobic.

00:11.100 --> 00:13.000
Mm. It's growing pains, that's all.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.800
So, what time do you feel
you'll be going home?

00:15.700 --> 00:18.800
Andy was just telling me
he's joining the air force.

00:18.700 --> 00:22.600
He noticed my hair,
and detectives, they catch everything.

00:23.600 --> 00:25.500
Hey, Son.

00:25.500 --> 00:27.400
Late for church.
What else is new?

00:27.400 --> 00:30.200
- Should I be looking for M.P. S?
- No, I finagled a pass.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074

01:03.600 --> 01:05.900
She's got it.

01:07.200 --> 01:10.400
- What do we got?
- D.O.A. Somebody chopped his head off.

01:10.400 --> 01:13.000
The guy's in his boxer shorts
propped up in a chair.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.600
His head's facedown in his own lap.

01:15.600 --> 01:18.100
The doorman says the tenant's a male
in his mid 40s, which fits...

01:18.100 --> 01:21.200
but I didn't let him look
at the D.O.A.'s head.

01:21.100 --> 01:23.700
- I was afraid to disturb the body before you got here.
- There's no other body?

01:23.600 --> 01:25.700
- No. -
Hey. - Hey.

01:25.700 --> 01:28.200
- What do we got?
- One D.O.A.

01:28.100 --> 01:31.400
Forty-year-old white guy.
Head cut off.

01:32.800 --> 01:35.600
This cop over here, she looks like
she's ready to change careers.

01:37.200 --> 01:40.300
Why don't you come on and run this for us.

01:40.300 --> 01:42.300
In there?

01:42.300 --> 01:44.300
Yeah. That'd be good.

01:52.400 --> 01:54.400
Watch where you step.

02:00.700 --> 02:03.100
Uh, an anonymous female
calls the precinct...

02:03.100 --> 02:05.800
says someone might be hurt
in this apartment.

02:05.800 --> 02:08.600
Me and my partner come over, knock,
tried the door when there was no answer.

02:08.500 --> 02:11.100
It's unlocked.
When we come in, that's what we see.

02:11.100 --> 02:13.200
- Who covered him up?
- My partner.

02:16.700 --> 02:18.900
All right.
Let's see what we got here.

02:23.900 --> 02:26.300
You don't often encounter
this method of suicide.

02:28.300 --> 02:30.700
What's the name of that kid's story,
Ichabod Crane?

02:30.700 --> 02:33.100
The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.

02:33.100 --> 02:35.500
The Headless Horseman.

02:35.400 --> 02:37.800
I thought that was
about Notre Dame.

02:40.700 --> 02:44.200
Officer McGuire, you could do us a favor.
You could send the doorman up.

02:49.200 --> 02:51.700
She'll be okay.

02:51.600 --> 02:54.500
Hmm. Let's see his mug.

02:54.500 --> 02:57.100
Oh...

03:02.600 --> 03:04.600
He don't look much happier
in that photograph.

03:07.300 --> 03:10.400
Hope he didn't wanna
get buried wearing a hat.

04:17.300 --> 04:19.200
It's Mr. Reese.
That's definite.

04:19.200 --> 04:22.000
Yeah. Gotta contact his mother.

04:21.899 --> 04:25.000
You figure the fatal weapon
for some type of kitchen knife?

04:24.900 --> 04:29.900
You know, when I first came up, Mr. Pelacanos,
you said you had some information for me.

04:29.800 --> 04:33.300
- Oh, if you want, you can call me Gus.
- What's your information, Gus?

04:33.200 --> 04:35.500
Firstly, his length of residency...

04:35.400 --> 04:38.300
Mr. Reese lived in the building
two years, nine months.

04:38.300 --> 04:40.900
Keep to himself type person,
but very nice and polite.

04:40.900 --> 04:44.200
The man was a professor at N. Y.U. University.
I'm not sure what subject...

04:44.100 --> 04:48.100
but you could tell looking at him
that he was an educated and intelligent man.

04:48.100 --> 04:51.500
Is this background information on Mr. Reese,
or is there something related to the crime?

04:51.300 --> 04:53.700
Not passing judgment-
Occasionally I would see Mr. Reese...

04:53.700 --> 04:57.900
- in company with various guys, late teens, early 20s.
- Students?

04:57.800 --> 05:01.700
These weren't collegiate types, no.
They were mostly Spanish.

05:01.600 --> 05:05.000
- Light-skinned blacks.
- So forget college, huh?

05:05.000 --> 05:08.600
Oh, these were street-type individuals, Detective.
Or what you would call a hustler type.

05:08.500 --> 05:10.500
You figure Mr. Reese
was having sex with these guys?

05:10.400 --> 05:13.200
Not passing judgment, I would work up
that investigative angle, yeah.

05:13.200 --> 05:15.900
When was the last time
you saw him with one of these guys?

05:15.900 --> 05:19.800
Three, four weeks back, Mr. Reese
was in the company of a Spanish kid...

05:19.600 --> 05:21.600
whose name is on the tip
of my tongue...

05:21.500 --> 05:24.800
I'm looking at him right now in my mind-
which Mr. Reese introduced me.

05:24.800 --> 05:27.100
Nobody last night?
Last few days?

05:27.100 --> 05:30.200
- No, sir.
- All right, thanks.

05:30.200 --> 05:32.400
You intend on working up
that investigative angle?

05:33.600 --> 05:35.700
Yeah, right.
We're gonna look into that possibility.

05:35.800 --> 05:38.500
Happy to provide it.
And that kid's name is gonna come to me.

05:38.400 --> 05:41.100
You got my card there, right?

05:41.100 --> 05:43.200
- So, you remember, you give me a call.
- Right. Right.

05:43.100 --> 05:44.900
- Good-lookin' kid.
- Mm-hmm.

05:51.700 --> 05:54.700
Yeah, New York City
Gay Defense League.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.900
Uh-huh.
I'll make sure he...

05:58.400 --> 06:02.200
Sir, he will get the message.
I can't say when he'll return the call.

06:02.100 --> 06:06.000
All right.
You're welcome.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.700
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay. Can I speak to a detective, please?

06:08.600 --> 06:10.600
Excuse me.
You're Vanessa Del Rio.

06:10.700 --> 06:13.400
Right. I've been getting
harassing phone calls at home.

06:13.400 --> 06:16.300
I knew it was you.
I said to myself, 'Hey, wait a minute.

06:16.200 --> 06:18.200
- That's a celebrity there."
- Where should I know you from?

06:18.200 --> 06:22.400
She's sort of a famous performer
in the field of adult entertainment, Donna.

06:22.300 --> 06:25.500
- Films.
- Interesting.

06:25.400 --> 06:28.200
I got this buddy, Miss Del Rio,
to this day, he's still nuts about you.

06:28.200 --> 06:30.900
That's cool. Uh, who do I speak to
about these harassing phone calls?

06:30.900 --> 06:33.000
Well, I'm your man.
I'm-I'm a detective.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.400
I'm Detective Martinez.
How you doin'?

06:35.400 --> 06:38.000
Not too great 'cause of these friggin' calls
I'm getting at home.

06:37.900 --> 06:41.000
Yeah. All right. Well, why don't we go
in the coffee room. We'll talk about it.

06:45.400 --> 06:47.100
Lieutenant...

06:47.100 --> 06:50.500
you got several calls from the head
of the New York City Gay Defense League.

06:50.400 --> 06:52.900
- About Simone's homicide?
- Uh, he wouldn't say...

06:52.800 --> 06:54.800
but he was very persistent
that you call him back.

06:54.700 --> 06:58.000
Hey, boss, I think we found the murder weapon-
butcher knife in a towel.

06:57.900 --> 07:00.000
- Thrown down the garbage chute.
- Any direction on a perp?

07:00.000 --> 07:03.200
Well, the doorman said that the D.O.A.
Used to bring home male hustlers.

07:03.200 --> 07:06.300
N.Y.U. Professor
getting hit in the heinie.

07:06.200 --> 07:09.000
- I'm gonna grab a radio.
- There was a message on the answering machine...

07:08.900 --> 07:12.700
from the mother, talking about some
dangerous guy who was staying at the apartment...

07:12.700 --> 07:16.600
telling the D.O.A. That he either needs
to get the guy outta there or get out himself.

07:16.500 --> 07:20.200
- You reach out to the mother?
- We got her address, so we're gonna make notification.

07:20.100 --> 07:23.500
Gay professor gets decapitated.
This one's gonna get hot.

07:23.500 --> 07:26.000
- You got that phone number?
- Mm-hmm.

07:25.900 --> 07:28.200
Diane, could you,
uh, voucher this?

07:28.200 --> 07:30.600
Sure. Can I get you a cup of coffee
on your way out?

07:33.900 --> 07:37.800
So, uh, tell me about
this harassment, Miss Del Rio.

07:37.800 --> 07:41.000
Some creep keeps leaving
messages on my machine...

07:40.900 --> 07:42.900
telling me he wants to screw me.

07:42.800 --> 07:46.000
That one of these days I'm gonna belong to him.
All kinds of sick stuff.

07:45.900 --> 07:48.700
- Any idea who it might be?
- Every time I pick up the phone...

07:48.600 --> 07:50.900
and say, Who the hell is this?"
He just hangs up.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
And how often does he call?

07:53.000 --> 07:56.200
I've got about 15 messages
on tape in the last two months.

07:56.100 --> 07:58.400
And you don't recognize the voice?

07:58.500 --> 08:01.300
No. So last week I filed a complaint
with the Annoying Calls...

08:01.200 --> 08:03.900
- The Annoyance Calls Bureau.
- Yeah, so they're trapping my calls.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.400
They know who it is. They won't tell me.
They say I need a detective...

08:06.400 --> 08:09.100
- to contact them for phone calls.
- I can help you with that.

08:09.100 --> 08:12.400
You know, I've got a 1-900
fantasy voice mail line...

08:12.400 --> 08:15.700
$3.99 a minute, this jerk can say
whatever the hell he wants.

08:15.600 --> 08:20.500
But, see, that's Vanessa,
this is Anna Maria.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.700
- I know the difference.
- Anna Maria, huh?

08:24.000 --> 08:26.400
- Anna Maria what?
- Sanchez.

08:26.400 --> 08:29.200
Sanchez.
That's a pretty name.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.400
Hmm.

08:31.300 --> 08:33.299
Thank you very much.

08:49.900 --> 08:51.800
- Margaret Reese?
- Yes?

08:51.800 --> 08:55.100
New York Police.
I'm Detective Sipowicz.

08:55.100 --> 08:57.700
- This is Detective Simone.
- What is it?

08:57.700 --> 09:00.500
We're very sorry, but there's been
an accident involving your son, Daniel.

09:01.700 --> 09:03.800
I'm sorry, but your son's dead.

09:12.200 --> 09:14.600
We're very sorry for your loss, ma'am.

09:14.600 --> 09:17.100
What sort of accident?
Did he wreck the car?

09:20.400 --> 09:25.200
Your son was the victim
of a homicide, Mrs. Reese.

09:26.300 --> 09:28.900
This would never have happened
if he'd stayed here.

09:28.900 --> 09:30.700
You mean if he would have
stayed here last night?

09:30.800 --> 09:34.000
No, if he hadn't moved away
and left me alone.

09:33.900 --> 09:36.700
I knew there were people
who would take advantage of him.

09:36.700 --> 09:39.400
Are you thinking
of someone in particular...

09:39.400 --> 09:41.600
- who would have harmed your son?
- No.

09:41.600 --> 09:44.600
- Did you call Daniel last night, ma'am?
- Yes.

09:44.500 --> 09:47.400
'Cause there was a message on his answering
machine from a woman who sounded like you...

09:47.400 --> 09:51.200
who mentioned someone being
there in the apartment with him.

09:51.100 --> 09:53.800
And that you feel like
this other person oughta leave.

09:53.700 --> 09:56.500
Last week, Daniel told me
that he was letting a fella stay there...

09:56.500 --> 09:59.000
for a day or two,
who was down on his luck.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.600
Daniel is like that, you see.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.500
Yesterday I called.
This was a full week later.

10:03.600 --> 10:07.700
I'm not an intrusive
or a butting-in type of mother.

10:07.600 --> 10:12.000
And this man answered the phone.
He was still there.

10:11.900 --> 10:14.800
When I asked him how much longer
he planned to stay, he became abusive.

10:14.800 --> 10:18.200
- He- He was cursing me.
- Excuse me. About what time was this yesterday?

10:18.200 --> 10:21.000
In the morning.
After that, I called Daniel at the university...

10:21.000 --> 10:24.200
and asked him when
that person was getting out.

10:24.100 --> 10:27.600
Daniel said that he planned
on trying to make him leave last night.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.900
This person,
do you know his name?

10:29.900 --> 10:32.300
Daniel said it was a former student of his.
He never mentioned a name.

10:32.300 --> 10:35.100
Former student. Did you ever meet him?
See what he looks like?

10:35.000 --> 10:38.200
- No.
- From the conversation where he was cursing you...

10:38.200 --> 10:40.800
what do you remember
about his voice?

10:40.800 --> 10:43.700
Did he have a foreign accent?

10:43.600 --> 10:46.000
- Did he sound black? White?
- I couldn't tell.

10:46.100 --> 10:48.200
Mrs. Reese, did you call
the 15th Precinct this morning...

10:48.200 --> 10:50.200
to check for trouble
in your son's apartment?

10:50.100 --> 10:52.200
No. I was waiting
for him to call me back.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.900
- Do you have Daniel's car?
- I'm sorry?

10:56.800 --> 11:00.300
The Oldsmobile. It's registered in his name,
but we paid for it together.

11:00.200 --> 11:02.300
Do you know where it is?
I'd like to have it.

11:02.300 --> 11:05.100
Uh, we could find out
and let you know.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
- I wonder if it's been stolen.
- If you could give us the license plate...

11:08.000 --> 11:10.400
it might turn out helpful
in finding who did this.

11:10.400 --> 11:12.500
I'll write it down for you.

11:19.700 --> 11:21.700
How was Daniel murdered?

11:24.100 --> 11:28.500
Believe me...

11:28.400 --> 11:32.000
being a parent, I hate to have to
tell you something like this...

11:31.900 --> 11:35.100
but you'll need to know
for identification purposes.

11:35.100 --> 11:40.200
Your son was stabbed very badly
in the region of the neck.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.300
The knife went pretty much
right through.

11:43.300 --> 11:46.500
Are you telling me his head was cut off?
That he was decapitated?

11:49.000 --> 11:51.500
Mrs. Reese, we are...

11:51.400 --> 11:56.400
We are terribly sorry,
but it is better if you hear it now.

11:58.300 --> 12:04.100
Yes, it's good to know
in dealing with the funeral arrangements.

12:21.100 --> 12:24.300
Hey, Detective, I remember the kid.
This is Joey Suarez.

12:24.300 --> 12:27.900
You guys wanna talk to me
about Professor Reese?

12:27.900 --> 12:30.700
Uh, yeah. I'll tell you what. Why don't you
get started with Detective Sipowicz.

12:30.700 --> 12:33.300
- I got a couple of phone calls to make.
- Come on. You want some coffee?

12:33.300 --> 12:35.200
Yeah. All right.

12:37.100 --> 12:40.300
Gus, I said if you
thought of a name, call us.

12:40.300 --> 12:43.700
Oh, I saved you a step.
This kid, he moves furniture.

12:43.600 --> 12:47.000
And I saw him unloading
his truck over on Houston.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.800
What'd you tell this kid?

12:48.800 --> 12:51.200
Just how Mr. Reese got
his head cut off last night.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.300
Did you describe any details
of the crime scene?

12:53.400 --> 12:56.400
Hey, I absolutely tell you,
Detective, from his reaction...

12:56.200 --> 12:59.100
this Joey definitely
was not involved.

12:59.100 --> 13:01.900
All right, I'll talk to him. I want you
to sit on this bench right here, Gus.

13:01.800 --> 13:04.900
- You want me to wait until he's done?
- I want you to sit on the bench.

13:04.900 --> 13:07.400
- Hi, Vanessa. Come on in.
- Excuse me.

13:07.300 --> 13:09.900
Yeah.

13:09.900 --> 13:12.000
Good to see you again.

13:13.900 --> 13:16.000
Do you know a Richard Hart?

13:16.100 --> 13:18.200
Rick Hart?
Is that who's doing this?

13:18.200 --> 13:21.800
- That's my information.
- He's this guy I see at all my personal appearances.

13:21.600 --> 13:25.200
Just a little average guy
that says how much he likes my work.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.600
I've seen him in Philly, Baltimore,
all over the place.

13:27.600 --> 13:30.200
A lot of people follow you
from town to town?

13:30.200 --> 13:33.400
Some of them travel in their business.
I thought he was just a big fan.

13:33.400 --> 13:35.700
This Rick Hart, he never behaved strangely
at one of your appearances?

13:35.700 --> 13:38.700
- He never seemed threatening?
- He's not a threatening-looking guy.

13:38.600 --> 13:43.400
I could probably take him in a fight.
He's not a convicted rapist or anything, is he?

13:43.300 --> 13:45.300
I checked.
He's got no criminal record.

13:45.300 --> 13:49.000
But you never know when one of these guys
might decide to do more than talk about it.

13:48.900 --> 13:51.300
If I went ahead with the complaint,
is this gonna mean...

13:51.300 --> 13:53.400
- a long, drawn-out court proceeding?
- It's gonna take some time.

13:53.400 --> 13:56.300
- But maybe it's worth you following through.
- What if you just talked to him?

13:56.200 --> 13:58.800
Could you figure out
if he was dangerous or something?

13:58.800 --> 14:00.700
I got his address.
I could talk to him.

14:00.800 --> 14:02.700
Maybe I could act like
an intermediate step.

14:02.700 --> 14:04.900
Oh, you know, you'd really be a doll
if you could do that.

14:04.900 --> 14:06.800
Especially if I could avoid
a big deal in court.

14:06.800 --> 14:10.000
All right, sure.
We'll go talk to this guy.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.100
Listen, Vanessa. Um, you remember
that buddy I told you about of mine?

14:13.900 --> 14:16.400
He's definitely gonna flip out
over you being here.

14:16.400 --> 14:18.800
Your buddy's gonna
be excited, huh?

14:18.700 --> 14:22.600
Vanessa Del Rio?
He's been talking about you since high school.

14:22.600 --> 14:25.200
- And what's your buddy's name?
- Manny.

14:25.200 --> 14:28.800
Manny? Little Manny?
Is that what you call it? How cute.

14:28.700 --> 14:31.300
Hey, wait a minute.
This is a real friend of mine.

14:31.300 --> 14:34.300
I believe you.

14:42.600 --> 14:45.000
This place you met
Professor Reese on Canal Street?

14:45.000 --> 14:47.200
S.O.S., right, on Canal.

14:47.100 --> 14:50.400
- That's not a gay club.
- No, it's all types. But, I mean, even so...

14:50.300 --> 14:52.300
I noticed this guy
looking all out of place.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.600
- How's that?
- Well, for one, he don't ever be dancing.

14:54.600 --> 14:57.300
This is how he would do.
He would go into the bathroom.

14:57.300 --> 14:59.400
Check you out.
Say, Do you wanna smoke a joint?"

14:59.400 --> 15:01.400
Boom. Cool. Sure.

15:01.300 --> 15:04.500
- So, he gives you one. You fire it up.
- This guy smoked dope?

15:04.500 --> 15:08.200
No, he wouldn't be smoking.
That's just like an icebreaker.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.100
Then he'd say there's
more of that at his place.

15:10.100 --> 15:12.600
- So then what would happen at his place?
- Yeah, you get high.

15:12.600 --> 15:16.000
Conversate"
till he makes his move.

15:15.900 --> 15:18.200
Then either you do
or you don't, whatever.

15:18.100 --> 15:20.900
Maybe you just smoke up
some more of his pot and then leave.

15:20.900 --> 15:24.600
- He was in this club a lot?
- Maybe once a week.

15:24.500 --> 15:27.600
But I told him this myself.
I said, What you're doing, man...

15:27.600 --> 15:31.100
this is laying yourself open
for all kinds of things."

15:31.100 --> 15:33.100
I was talking mainly about burglary,
because he had some nice stuff.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
But, uh, going up to somebody
in a bathroom...

15:35.900 --> 15:38.900
and it ain't even a gay club really-
that's taking a risk.

15:38.800 --> 15:41.300
- What did Mr. Reese say to that?
- Nothing.

15:41.300 --> 15:43.700
- He's just a real lonely guy. It's a shame really.
- Mm-hmm.

15:43.700 --> 15:46.900
You talked to him at all since you
hung out with him three weeks ago?

15:46.900 --> 15:50.800
- He knew I wasn't with that sex.
- You just smoke up all of his pot and then leave.

15:50.700 --> 15:54.200
- It was some good pot too.
- Just for the record, Joey, what were you doing last night?

15:58.400 --> 16:02.300
Damn. This is what I get
for coming down here to help you all?

16:02.100 --> 16:04.300
- We have to ask.
- I was with my girlfriend.

16:04.300 --> 16:06.900
Why don't you write down
the name and address.

16:11.700 --> 16:14.200
- So, I'm a suspect?
- While you got the pen there, Joey...

16:14.100 --> 16:17.500
write down the names of some of the other guys
that went to that dance club...

16:17.400 --> 16:20.900
that might have taken
Mr. Reese up on his hospitality like you did.

16:20.900 --> 16:24.500
Who may or may not have been gracious enough
to make him feel loved.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.700
- I got no way of knowing about no other guy.
- Come on, Joey.

16:26.700 --> 16:29.200
The only reason I came here
is I feel sorry for the guy.

16:29.200 --> 16:31.100
I'm being straight up with you.

16:31.200 --> 16:34.000
Does your girlfriend know you go home
with men you meet in public toilets?

16:33.800 --> 16:36.500
Yeah, I told her about it.
I took her some of the dope.

16:36.500 --> 16:39.700
All right. Calm down, Joey.
Look, I think you're being straight with us.

16:39.700 --> 16:43.400
But whatever decent impulse it was
that brought you down here...

16:43.400 --> 16:47.400
you need to follow through on that
and put some names down on that pad, huh?

16:47.200 --> 16:51.300
See, we have to talk to as many people
as we can that have spent time with Mr. Reese.

16:51.200 --> 16:54.900
That great dope he gave you, Joey,
you owe him that much.

17:10.400 --> 17:13.400
When he was 16, my buddy Manny said
he snuck into a topless bar.

17:13.400 --> 17:16.400
- Yeah?
- Saw Vanessa Del Rio dancing up on the stage.

17:16.300 --> 17:18.300
- Said he stayed excited for three weeks.
- Aw, man.

17:18.400 --> 17:21.099
I'll tell you. I wish I was in the house...

17:21.099 --> 17:23.200
When she was making a complaint.

17:23.099 --> 17:25.800
- So, how's she looking now?
- You know, she's no kid.

17:25.700 --> 17:27.800
- But she looks all right.
- Yeah?

17:27.800 --> 17:30.100
- Who is it?
- Police.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.900
- Police?
- Yeah, police. Open up.

17:32.900 --> 17:34.900
- You Rick Hart?
- What's this about?

17:34.900 --> 17:36.600
Come here.

17:36.600 --> 17:39.100
I'm Detective Martinez.
This is Detective Medavoy.

17:39.100 --> 17:41.600
We've been receiving complaints
about harassing phone calls...

17:41.600 --> 17:43.900
- getting made from this address.
- Harassing phone calls?

17:43.900 --> 17:46.900
- That's what I said. You got a hearing problem?
- You live here with anybody?

17:46.900 --> 17:49.000
- No.
- So, you're the one who's making the calls then?

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You know what I'm talking about.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.300
You've been making sexually-explicit,
threatening phone calls to Vanessa Del Rio.

17:55.200 --> 17:58.800
And we're here to figure out if you're
too warped to keep yourself from stopping.

17:58.700 --> 18:01.600
'Cause if you can't control yourself,
we could lock your ass up right now.

18:01.600 --> 18:04.300
You have no right coming here
making these accusations.

18:04.300 --> 18:06.800
Mr. Hart, we know your history
of following Miss Del Rio around.

18:06.800 --> 18:09.100
And we have a record
of the calls you've made.

18:09.100 --> 18:11.600
- You've lived here a long time, right, Mr. Hart?
- Seven years.

18:11.600 --> 18:15.300
You've been employed
at Rowe Plant Interiors 14 years now?

18:15.300 --> 18:17.300
Have you been investigating me?

18:17.200 --> 18:19.700
You got a pretty set lifestyle.
Imagine getting that disrupted...

18:19.600 --> 18:23.900
or if your employer finding out you were making
these anonymous, harassing phone calls.

18:23.800 --> 18:27.500
Suppose someone anonymously
sent your employer those tapes.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.600
Please don't do that.
I'll stop calling her.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.700
You gonna stop calling
Miss Del Rio?

18:31.600 --> 18:34.300
You should probably stay away
from her personal appearances too.

18:34.300 --> 18:36.600
I never would hurt her in real life.
Please make her understand that.

18:36.500 --> 18:39.000
I'm sure she'll be fascinated
finding that out.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.300
I'm so ashamed
for having these thoughts.

18:41.200 --> 18:43.200
Maybe you should get
some help with that.

18:43.200 --> 18:45.500
Point is, Mr. Hart,
you're on our list.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.400
You have a sex file with us
that's active and open.

18:47.400 --> 18:50.600
I understand.
I promise not to do it anymore.

18:50.600 --> 18:54.200
Tell her I'm sorry.
And I think she's still the best actress in her field.

19:07.500 --> 19:11.800
Yeah, thatJoey gave up four names.
I'm gonna run 'em through B.C.I.

19:11.700 --> 19:14.600
We, uh, probably oughta have Diane
make sure his story's right.

19:14.600 --> 19:17.600
What, being with the girlfriend last night?
Gimme her name.

19:17.500 --> 19:19.400
Yeah, this is Detective Sipowicz,
15th Squad.

19:19.500 --> 19:23.200
I'm on a short clock,
so I'll stay on while you pull these up.

19:23.200 --> 19:26.200
Yeah, J-O-L-L-Y.
Like ha, ha, ha.

19:26.200 --> 19:29.100
- Hey, AndyJr.
- How's it going?

19:29.000 --> 19:32.200
I'm fine. Your dad didn't mention
you'd be passing this way.

19:32.100 --> 19:34.600
- It's a surprise visit.
- Andy.

19:35.900 --> 19:38.000
Uh, hold on a second.
You all right?

19:37.900 --> 19:40.800
- Hey, Pop.
- I got this.

19:40.700 --> 19:45.700
- What's the name?
- Uh, here. The second guy here, LaGrande.

19:45.500 --> 19:47.500
- You got it?
- Yeah.

19:47.500 --> 19:49.600
- LaGrande?
- Hey.

19:49.600 --> 19:52.300
- You look good.
- Thanks for the Christmas present.

19:52.300 --> 19:55.800
Yeah. Well, Sylvia picked that out.
They got it to ya at the base, huh?

19:55.800 --> 19:57.900
How's she coming
with her pregnancy and all?

19:57.900 --> 20:02.400
Well, she's due May 17.
Gonna be a boy. Gonna have a brother.

20:02.300 --> 20:04.700
- That's great.
- Yeah. So, what are you doing here? You on leave?

20:04.700 --> 20:07.700
- I wanted to talk to you about that.
- What?

20:07.600 --> 20:10.900
Excuse me, Andy. The registrar's office at N.Y.U.
Wants to know how far back...

20:10.900 --> 20:13.900
- you wanna go with the list with Daniel Reese students.
- When he started teaching.

20:13.800 --> 20:15.900
I don't mean to interrupt.
Hi, Andy.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.100
- Hi.
- Adrianne Lesniak. I met you at your dad's wedding.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Sure. Good to see you again.

20:19.900 --> 20:22.400
So, uh, what's up?
Things okay with the air force?

20:22.300 --> 20:24.300
Uh, well, I wanna talk
to you about that.

20:24.300 --> 20:26.500
Well, is it okay or not? What?

20:26.500 --> 20:28.800
We'll talk about it
when we have time to sit down.

20:28.800 --> 20:32.400
Excuse me, Detective.
Margaret Reese on line two.

20:32.400 --> 20:35.100
Uh...

20:35.100 --> 20:37.700
I gotta take this call, Andy.

20:37.600 --> 20:40.200
This woman's son
was a homicide last night.

20:40.200 --> 20:44.500
I'm gonna go see Mom. I just drove
cross-country. I haven't even seen her yet.

20:44.400 --> 20:46.300
Yeah, listen, I wanna find out
what's going on here...

20:46.300 --> 20:49.100
so why don't you have supper
with Sylvia and me tonight.

20:49.100 --> 20:52.100
Sure. Good.
7:00, like the other time?

20:52.100 --> 20:57.100
Yeah, yeah, good. Uh, but you're not in
any trouble or anything, right?

20:57.000 --> 21:00.200
I can't tell you about it
in, like, two minutes, Dad.

21:00.200 --> 21:03.500
- We'll talk about it at dinner.
- All right.

21:05.300 --> 21:08.000
Okay, the third name's Tim.
About 20.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.500
Hello, Mrs. Reese.

21:10.500 --> 21:12.900
No, no progress with the car.

21:12.900 --> 21:15.800
Uh, wait a minute. What wallet?
What are you talking about?

21:15.800 --> 21:18.400
- At your house?
- Thanks.

21:20.500 --> 21:23.400
D.O.A.'s mother says
a uniformed cop turned in...

21:23.300 --> 21:25.300
the kid's wallet
about 15 minutes ago.

21:25.200 --> 21:30.000
Listen, Mrs. Reese. We didn't know
that your son's wallet had been found...

21:29.900 --> 21:32.600
and we need to talk to the officer
that brought it to you.

21:34.400 --> 21:36.500
You think that's it?

21:36.500 --> 21:39.900
Litvac?
L- I-T-V-A-C.

21:39.900 --> 21:42.100
Yeah, all right.
Thank you very much.

21:42.100 --> 21:45.000
Yeah, definitely,
any sign of the car.

21:44.900 --> 21:47.300
Mm-hmm.

21:47.300 --> 21:50.600
Some idiot cop recovers
this guy's wallet...

21:50.500 --> 21:53.400
and he drives it out
to the mother in Queens?

21:53.400 --> 21:56.000
Donna, would you do me a favor?

21:56.000 --> 21:59.400
Would you call chief of personnel?
I'm looking for a uniform named Litvac.

21:59.200 --> 22:01.500
Sure, Detective.

22:01.500 --> 22:03.800
- How's AndyJr. Doing? He's looking good.
- Yeah, yeah, he looks okay.

22:03.800 --> 22:07.500
But, I mean, I ask him how's things
in the service, he says he'll tell me at dinner.

22:07.500 --> 22:10.700
- I don't like the sound of that.
- You know if he's having any problems over there?

22:10.700 --> 22:14.600
Well, either the answer is things
in the service are good, or any other answer.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.400
I mean, it means the opposite.

22:16.400 --> 22:19.500
Anyway, Andy, look. We got the rap sheet
on these four guys thatJoey gave you.

22:19.400 --> 22:22.000
Of course, you know,
you could be a choirboy.

22:21.900 --> 22:25.500
Some officer decides he doesn't like you,
you're just a sittin' duck.

22:25.400 --> 22:29.000
One of these assholes
decides you rub him the wrong way...

22:28.800 --> 22:30.700
Just don't get
ahead of yourself, okay?

22:30.800 --> 22:33.000
Yeah.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.900
Diane's not around,
so I'm gonna checkJoey's alibi here.

22:35.900 --> 22:39.300
If this kid's in trouble with drugs or booze,
I'm gonna kick his ass.

22:39.200 --> 22:42.900
Unless one of these sons ofbitches
is persecuting him.

22:42.900 --> 22:46.200
Then I'm gonna find out his name,
his address, I'm gonna kick his ass.

22:46.200 --> 22:48.100
Hi. Yeah, is this
Joey DeCosta?

22:48.100 --> 22:50.100
Yeah, this is Detective Simone
from the 15th Squad.

22:50.100 --> 22:53.200
Just wondering if I could take a minute
to ask you what you were doing last night.

22:53.100 --> 22:56.000
You know, I'll tell you.
If they take an irrational dislike to you...

22:56.000 --> 22:58.500
- it don't matter what you do.
- Andy.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.100
Young kid like this nowadays.

23:05.000 --> 23:10.400
I'm telling you, it's not easy.

23:20.100 --> 23:21.700
Yeah, me.

23:23.500 --> 23:25.700
Boss, you gave us a 10-2?

23:25.700 --> 23:30.400
Yeah, Officer Litvac?
Detective Simone, Sipowicz, 15th Squad.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.400
- How's it goin'?
- Hey.

23:32.400 --> 23:35.300
Yeah, we wanted to talk to you
about this wallet you drove out to Bayside.

23:35.200 --> 23:39.100
It belonged to a Daniel Reese. I found it
on the floor of the backseat of my R&P.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.400
Took it out to the address
on the driver's license on my meal period.

23:42.400 --> 23:45.100
Yeah. Well, they say it belongs to that D.O.A.
That got his head sliced off last night.

23:45.100 --> 23:48.800
- No kiddin'. That was that guy?
- When you took it out there...

23:48.700 --> 23:51.300
Mrs. Reese didn't mention anything
about it belonging to her murdered son?

23:51.200 --> 23:53.700
She said it was his wallet
and thanks for bringing it.

23:53.700 --> 23:56.300
Then she asked
about the status of the stolen car.

23:56.300 --> 23:58.500
I told her I didn't know
anything about that.

23:58.600 --> 24:00.700
She didn't mention
no homicide at all.

24:00.700 --> 24:03.800
The cops in that sector car
made one collar around 200 a.m.

24:05.200 --> 24:07.100
Male black.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.900
Disorderly and public lewdness."

24:11.000 --> 24:15.100
Subject was observed behaving erratically,
waving and yelling in traffic.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.900
Subject was not
wearing underwear...

24:16.900 --> 24:18.800
and his pants were hanging down,
revealing his genitals."

24:18.800 --> 24:20.800
Our guy took his underwear off
at the D.O.A.'s apartment.

24:20.900 --> 24:24.000
Sarge, this collar, Rodney Wellstone,
where is he in the system?

24:23.800 --> 24:25.800
Lodged at Central Booking.

24:25.900 --> 24:29.300
Made one phone call when they brought him in-
Sheila Bell, 718 area code.

24:29.100 --> 24:31.100
Yeah, that's here
in the arrest report.

24:31.100 --> 24:34.300
We're gonna want this guy transported
to our house before he gets arraigned.

24:34.200 --> 24:36.600
Maybe we should reach out
to this Sheila Bell before they bring him in.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.800
Use the phone in the squad room.

24:39.800 --> 24:42.500
Thanks.

24:52.300 --> 24:54.600
My brother brought it here last night.

24:54.600 --> 24:57.000
He knocked on my door
around 11:00.

24:56.900 --> 25:00.700
- This is your brother Rodney?
- He said he needed a place to stay.

25:00.700 --> 25:04.600
But Rodney has serious mental problems,
and I didn't wanna let him in.

25:04.500 --> 25:06.600
You're afraid of him?

25:06.600 --> 25:09.500
I just stopped feeling
comfortable around him.

25:09.400 --> 25:12.100
His behavior could be so strange.
The things he said.

25:12.100 --> 25:16.200
- I hated turning him away.
- It stinks in here.

25:16.100 --> 25:18.500
What'd he do when you didn't let him in?

25:18.500 --> 25:21.000
He asked could he leave his car.
Would I watch it for him?

25:21.000 --> 25:24.600
He said a friend ofhis gave it to him.
Is it stolen?

25:24.500 --> 25:26.800
Is that why he was arrested?

25:26.800 --> 25:30.400
Uh, Miss Bell, the owner of this car,
he was murdered last night.

25:31.500 --> 25:33.400
Oh, God.

25:33.500 --> 25:36.900
I knew. I knew
this was gonna be bad.

25:36.700 --> 25:39.600
Did- Did Rodney mention
this Mr. Reese at all...

25:39.600 --> 25:42.100
this guy he was saying
was his friend?

25:42.100 --> 25:45.200
He said he was his teacher
when Rodney was in college.

25:45.100 --> 25:47.700
Frankly, I didn't wanna
get into it that much.

25:47.600 --> 25:52.500
So he left me the keys,
and then around 2:30 he called.

25:52.400 --> 25:55.000
Said he was in jail
and could I come and get him out.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.600
I didn't pick up.

25:57.600 --> 26:01.600
I let the machine get it
because I knew it was him, and I...

26:01.500 --> 26:04.000
I just can't deal with it.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.600
Did you call the precinct this morning,
tell them to go look in Mr. Reese's apartment?

26:07.500 --> 26:10.000
I knew Rodney was in trouble
over this car.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.600
So this morning I went outside
and got the registration, the owner's address.

26:13.500 --> 26:15.800
I found out
which precinct it was in.

26:15.800 --> 26:18.500
I called so they could check that address,
if things were all right.

26:18.500 --> 26:20.300
It's good you did that.

26:20.300 --> 26:23.900
And now this man's dead,
and Rodney probably killed him.

26:23.800 --> 26:25.300
Yeah.

26:25.400 --> 26:27.500
My brother was intelligent.

26:27.500 --> 26:29.500
He was funny.

26:29.500 --> 26:32.800
I don't know who this is
walking around in his body.

26:38.900 --> 26:41.600
The thing upsets me,
him possibly using drugs.

26:41.500 --> 26:44.400
Andy said he never took drugs
his whole life.

26:44.400 --> 26:47.400
He sat across from me
in a greasy spoon, said he never drank...

26:47.400 --> 26:49.300
never took drugs
'cause of what he saw with me.

26:49.300 --> 26:52.800
- And now something like this could be happening.
- This could be anything at all.

26:52.800 --> 26:55.300
He could have got transferred.
He could have met somebody.

26:55.200 --> 26:58.700
This was specifically in response
to How are things in the air force?"

26:58.700 --> 27:00.700
That's all it was.

27:04.200 --> 27:06.700
- Your guy's locked up in two.
- Does he seem nuts?

27:06.700 --> 27:08.600
He looks like the real deal.

27:08.700 --> 27:11.200
His sister said he had been psycho
three or four years ago.

27:11.100 --> 27:13.100
She was afraid to let him
in her house.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.200
I'm gonna have the Latent unit
check his prints against the list...

27:15.200 --> 27:18.800
but the N.Y.U. Registrar confirms Wellstone
took a course from Reese in 1990.

27:18.700 --> 27:22.100
With that past relationship,
his prints in the D.O.A.'s apartment...

27:22.000 --> 27:23.900
that's not gonna prove very much.

27:23.900 --> 27:26.800
It might have been nice if they had taken
the D.O.A.'s wallet off this guy...

27:26.800 --> 27:29.900
instead of finding it in the back
of a sector car the next morning.

27:29.900 --> 27:31.900
Well, we do got him
for boosting the D.O.A.'s car.

27:31.900 --> 27:35.900
Ah, his Legal Aid lawyer can say him
and the professor were kissy face.

27:35.900 --> 27:37.800
He had it with
the professor's permission...

27:37.800 --> 27:40.400
and everything bad happened
after Rodney took a hike.

27:40.300 --> 27:44.500
This guy says he's gonna give a statement,
but he's only gonna do it once...

27:44.300 --> 27:47.400
and then he's gonna stay silent
for four years and seven months.

27:47.400 --> 27:48.800
Hmm.

27:48.800 --> 27:52.200
We gotta get this guy videotaped.

27:52.100 --> 27:54.700
Four years and seven months.

27:54.600 --> 27:58.000
Detectives, I want my son's car.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.500
Mrs. Reese, I notified you like I promised.

28:00.500 --> 28:03.200
I explained the car's
been vouchered as evidence.

28:03.200 --> 28:05.400
It's in the pound now
in Whitestone, Queens.

28:05.300 --> 28:07.400
I want it.
It belongs to me and Daniel.

28:07.300 --> 28:09.900
Ma'am, we have to hold
the car a while.

28:09.800 --> 28:12.300
It might help us to prove a case
against a person who killed your son.

28:12.300 --> 28:14.400
Well, can I see it then?
I need to see it.

28:14.400 --> 28:17.000
I don't mean to be impolite,
Mrs. Reese...

28:16.900 --> 28:19.300
but what good
is seeing the car gonna do?

28:19.200 --> 28:22.000
Detective, please,
can I just be allowed to see it?

28:23.300 --> 28:26.200
I own that carjointly with Daniel.

28:27.600 --> 28:30.900
Can somebody drive her
out to the pound?

28:30.900 --> 28:34.100
- Yeah, yeah, all right.
- Thank you.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
Um, let's get a D.A.
And a video technician over here.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.900
You need to go have a conversation.

28:38.900 --> 28:40.900
Yeah, right.
I'll take care of that.

29:16.900 --> 29:18.900
All right, let's understand
each other, Rodney.

29:18.900 --> 29:22.200
You say you're only gonna do this once,
and we're trying to accommodate that.

29:22.100 --> 29:27.200
Put you on record right away. But this is to
give a statement about killing Professor Reese.

29:27.100 --> 29:30.100
I don't wanna hear you talk
about a presidential election...

29:30.100 --> 29:32.300
or start singing
Three Coins in the Fountain."

29:32.300 --> 29:35.400
Nothing like that.
Professor Daniel Reese.

29:35.400 --> 29:37.800
Is that machine turned on?

29:44.800 --> 29:47.800
I am District Attorney Leo Cohen.

29:47.800 --> 29:51.500
It is 4:27, February 27.

29:51.400 --> 29:53.700
Also present in the room...

29:53.800 --> 29:56.600
Detective Robert Simone,
shield number 3118.

29:56.500 --> 29:59.900
Detective Andy Sipowicz,
shield number 990.

29:59.900 --> 30:04.200
Also present Rodney Wellstone
and technician Lewis Moscovitz.

30:04.100 --> 30:06.600
Mr. Wellstone,
is that your signature on this form...

30:06.600 --> 30:08.700
indicating you understand
your right to counsel?

30:08.800 --> 30:11.300
Yes. I'm ready to speak.

30:13.200 --> 30:15.800
Now, Rodney, were you at
Daniel Reese's apartment last night?

30:15.800 --> 30:18.100
Yes, I was.

30:18.100 --> 30:20.000
What were you doing there?

30:20.000 --> 30:22.600
I had gotten evicted
from my apartment.

30:22.600 --> 30:25.700
I had lost my job.
I wasn't working.

30:25.700 --> 30:28.000
I was sleeping in my car
because I had no place to sleep.

30:27.900 --> 30:32.000
But the police in Brooklyn,
they towed my car away...

30:31.800 --> 30:34.000
so I went to a shelter.

30:33.900 --> 30:36.800
How long was this
before you met Daniel Reese?

30:36.700 --> 30:39.100
So, I went to a shelter.
But I don't like staying in the shelters...

30:39.100 --> 30:42.900
because of how people live,
so I came to Manhattan to hang out.

30:42.900 --> 30:46.700
I was hanging out by a gas station.
I wanted to be a service attendant.

30:46.600 --> 30:50.100
I'm not a bad guy.
But what happened, physically, I had died.

30:50.100 --> 30:53.100
I died and I was resurrected...

30:53.100 --> 30:57.600
by omnipotent pyrotechnics-
the Holy Spirit...

30:57.500 --> 31:00.300
which is the most powerful force
in the universe.

31:00.300 --> 31:03.600
Let's not get into the universal forces
too much, Rodney, okay?

31:03.600 --> 31:07.100
Tell us how you wound up
at Mr. Reese's apartment.

31:06.900 --> 31:09.700
Professor Reese drove
into the gas station, and he recognized me.

31:09.700 --> 31:12.800
- Where from?
- I took a philosophy class with him.

31:12.800 --> 31:16.500
- When was that?
- Mm, 1990?

31:16.400 --> 31:18.800
Okay, so he recognized you.
What happened after that?

31:18.800 --> 31:24.300
I asked him if I could have $20 because
I didn't have any money and I hadn't eaten.

31:24.200 --> 31:28.300
- He give it to you?
- No. He took me to a deli and bought me something to eat.

31:28.300 --> 31:31.000
He had a cup of coffee for himself.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.800
We chatted.
He's got a big heart.

31:33.700 --> 31:37.700
I know, because I reached in
through his neck and felt it down there.

31:41.000 --> 31:45.400
So he bought you some food from the deli.
Then he took you back to his apartment?

31:45.200 --> 31:49.000
I told him about getting evicted,
the whole sad story...

31:48.800 --> 31:51.700
but he said he didn't have
a place for me to stay.

31:51.700 --> 31:54.200
He gave me $10,
and he walked out.

31:54.200 --> 31:57.300
He didn't take you
to his apartment?

31:57.300 --> 32:00.500
- How'd you end up there?
- I knew Professor Reese wanted to help me.

32:00.400 --> 32:02.900
I knew he didn't just wanna
walk away like that.

32:02.900 --> 32:06.200
So I looked up his address
in the phone book.

32:06.200 --> 32:09.000
So you found his apartment building?

32:08.900 --> 32:11.400
Yes. And I hung around
until I saw him again...

32:11.400 --> 32:14.700
and I said,
Professor Reese, please...

32:14.700 --> 32:18.000
I just need a roof over my head
for a couple of days."

32:18.000 --> 32:19.900
And he said, All right."

32:19.900 --> 32:23.100
He said all right that you could stay with him?

32:23.100 --> 32:25.600
I was goin' hungry. I had died.

32:25.600 --> 32:28.800
I knew he wanted to help me.
He just insisted I had to wash my clothes.

32:28.800 --> 32:32.700
So I agreed to that.
That seemed reasonable.

32:32.600 --> 32:35.400
What day was this, Rodney?
Was it the first day you were there?

32:35.300 --> 32:38.600
Mm, what's today?
Friday?

32:38.500 --> 32:42.000
- Today's Tuesday.
- I don't recall exactly.

32:41.900 --> 32:44.600
It was several days ago.

32:44.600 --> 32:46.600
Several.
Do you smell me?

32:48.500 --> 32:50.500
Well, let's not worry
about that right now, Rodney.

32:50.400 --> 32:52.400
- Are you reacting to the way I smell?
- Let's not talk about that.

32:52.300 --> 32:54.900
Okay, so last night, what happened?

32:54.800 --> 32:58.200
Last night I wanted to murder him,
so I murdered him.

32:58.200 --> 33:01.300
Why did you wanna murder him?

33:01.300 --> 33:05.500
Oh, man, he wanted me to kill him anyway...
for the fun of it.

33:05.300 --> 33:07.800
'Cause you know what?
He's freaky like that.

33:07.800 --> 33:10.100
- What do you mean?
- He's a fag-faggoty-faggot.

33:10.100 --> 33:12.300
I could tell what was on his mind,
and I didn't like it.

33:12.300 --> 33:14.900
- Did he make a pass at you?
- I knew what was on his mind.

33:14.900 --> 33:17.300
I saw all those damn
Pump magazines in his bedroom.

33:17.300 --> 33:19.500
That's why he got all insistent
about me having to leave.

33:19.500 --> 33:21.400
Plus, his mother was saying
to kick me out.

33:21.400 --> 33:24.700
I talked to that bitch on the phone,
and I took offense to what she was saying...

33:24.700 --> 33:26.700
because I am God Almighty.

33:26.700 --> 33:28.400
Professor Reese said
that apartment was mine.

33:28.500 --> 33:31.300
He said all the money he had was mine.
His car was mine.

33:31.300 --> 33:33.400
When was this?

33:36.100 --> 33:38.000
When he was begging for his life.

33:39.700 --> 33:42.500
This is just before you killed him.

33:42.400 --> 33:45.400
He offered me all that.
Now he wants to throw me out?

33:47.200 --> 33:51.000
I took off my shirt.
I took off my pants.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.200
I said, Hey, I'm not going no place."

33:54.200 --> 33:56.900
And I took a knife from the kitchen,
and I made him go in there with me.

33:56.900 --> 33:59.800
And then I took him back out
in the living room and sit in his chair...

33:59.800 --> 34:04.200
like Mr. Big Bad Moojoo Man,
and I told him, I said, Take your clothes off.

34:04.100 --> 34:06.200
I know what you want."

34:06.300 --> 34:10.000
And he took them off,
and for a while he didn't say a word.

34:09.900 --> 34:12.699
Because he knew,
after he had insulted me like that...

34:12.699 --> 34:15.000
he knew that wasn't right.

34:16.199 --> 34:18.100
And then he started beggin'.

34:20.199 --> 34:23.400
- Then I stabbed him.
- Where'd you stab him?

34:23.400 --> 34:25.699
In the belly.

34:25.600 --> 34:28.800
And he went...

34:28.800 --> 34:30.699
And then I put him
out of his misery.

34:30.699 --> 34:33.699
L- I took his head off
from his body.

34:34.500 --> 34:37.000
Just like I'll do to you.

34:39.300 --> 34:41.500
You wanna stab me?

34:41.500 --> 34:45.600
I'll murder every person
in this building.

34:45.500 --> 34:48.100
I don't want that to happen, but we're gonna
have to ask you a few more questions.

34:48.100 --> 34:50.699
Do you think these handcuffs
can hold me?

34:50.699 --> 34:53.900
Rodney, what'd you do
after you cut off Daniel Reese's head?

34:53.800 --> 34:55.900
I won't speak of anything
subsequent to that.

34:57.200 --> 34:59.500
Except washed myself
sacramentally.

34:59.500 --> 35:02.300
I'm about to commence my four years
and seven months of silence.

35:02.200 --> 35:07.200
Before you do that, just tell us
why you did what you did...

35:07.000 --> 35:09.600
to Professor Reese.

35:10.900 --> 35:13.700
It was the most fitting
punishment I could think of.

35:13.700 --> 35:16.700
I am the Holy Spirit.
I give you consciousness of self.

35:16.500 --> 35:20.900
I control your heartbeat
through omnipotent pyrotechnics.

35:21.900 --> 35:23.900
And you're not faking this,
are you, Rodney?

35:25.200 --> 35:27.700
I was a student
in New York University...

35:27.700 --> 35:31.900
when I was first sanctified
by omnipotent pyrotechnics.

35:31.800 --> 35:34.100
I sometimes resented
my sanctification...

35:34.100 --> 35:37.300
because I was a student
and a family member...

35:37.300 --> 35:39.500
and I had hopes to study
philosophy abroad.

35:39.500 --> 35:42.900
But finally I came to accept my calling
and how I must live...

35:42.900 --> 35:47.400
in the same wayJesus Christ and his system
had doubts about his life, but finally accepted it.

35:47.200 --> 35:50.900
And even he, who had been my teacher,
I cut his faggot head off!

35:56.800 --> 35:59.000
Now I begin my silence.

36:15.400 --> 36:17.300
Oh, Detective Martinez,
this came for you.

36:17.300 --> 36:20.300
- Oh, yeah?
- From your favorite actress.

36:23.500 --> 36:25.500
What do you got?

36:26.600 --> 36:28.500
- Wow.
- Hey, look at that. Huh?

36:28.600 --> 36:33.200
To Detective Martinez, for your little buddy,
Manny. Love, Vanessa Del Rio."

36:33.100 --> 36:35.000
- Huh?
- Yeah, cute, huh?

36:35.000 --> 36:36.800
You gonna frame that, Detective?

36:36.800 --> 36:39.800
- Hey, look, she kissed it too.
- Yeah.

36:39.800 --> 36:41.800
How come she put
little buddy" in quotes?

36:42.900 --> 36:45.100
What's the picture?

36:45.100 --> 36:48.600
- James made quite an impression on that porno star.
- She's just joking around.

36:48.600 --> 36:50.600
She's supposed to be sexy?

36:50.600 --> 36:52.500
I don't find her at all sexy.

36:52.500 --> 36:55.500
- To each his own, I guess.
- You gonna keep that?

36:55.400 --> 36:59.300
Yeah, yeah, that's for him and his buddy
to look at on lonely nights.

36:59.200 --> 37:01.400
Hey, Greg, you're not helping
the situation much, you know.

37:01.400 --> 37:04.400
And the woman wondered why
she has perverts calling her up at home?

37:04.300 --> 37:07.000
I mean, she makes a living
showing her body to sick, pathetic guys...

37:06.900 --> 37:09.600
and then she's surprised when some 'warpo"
wants to take her up on it?

37:09.600 --> 37:13.300
Hey, it's not just sick, pathetic guys
that watch those movies.

37:13.300 --> 37:17.200
- Right, James?
- You don't look at that stuff, do you?

37:17.100 --> 37:19.200
- No.
- Hey, what's up, James?

37:19.200 --> 37:21.300
- Yo, Manny, my man.
- How you doin', man?

37:21.300 --> 37:23.700
- How's it going? That's my buddy, Manny.
- How you doing?

37:23.700 --> 37:26.900
- The world's biggest Vanessa Del Rio fan.
- Ah.

37:26.800 --> 37:29.300
Hey, was she here for real,
or is James messing with my mind?

37:29.300 --> 37:31.600
Oh, no, she was here, in the flesh.

37:31.600 --> 37:34.100
Damn, man! You should have called me
when she was here, man.

37:34.100 --> 37:36.300
- I would have gotten off of work.
- I told her about you, Manny.

37:36.300 --> 37:38.200
- How'd she look?
- How'd she look?

37:38.300 --> 37:39.700
- Yeah.
- Check this out.

37:39.700 --> 37:42.200
What you got for me?

37:42.200 --> 37:46.600
Oh. Oh, Vanessa baby!

37:46.500 --> 37:48.900
Look at you.
Look at you!

37:48.900 --> 37:51.400
Oh, she still looks good.

37:51.300 --> 37:53.700
Damn, I wish I was here, man!

37:53.800 --> 37:56.700
- It's yours, baby.
- Vanessa the undressa."

37:56.600 --> 38:00.300
The Latin from Manhattan.
Come on, boys, there's room at the end, man.

38:00.300 --> 38:04.200
- Isn't it pathetic?
- Hey, Adrianne, this is a large nation.

38:10.100 --> 38:13.900
That's the first one of those I've done.

38:13.800 --> 38:16.300
- Is that so?
- I mean, doesn't it get to you after a while?

38:16.300 --> 38:19.000
Listening to that sickness,
not being able to respond.

38:18.900 --> 38:21.200
No, I always found myself
cheery and peppy afterwards.

38:21.300 --> 38:25.000
Detective! Our car is ruined.
You're gonna have to do something.

38:24.900 --> 38:27.000
- Mrs. Reese, try and calm down.
- No, no, no, no.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.100
I went down to that impound lot.
Now, I own that car jointly with my son.

38:30.100 --> 38:33.500
And now somebody's
rancid body odor is in it.

38:33.400 --> 38:35.500
Daniel would never
have tolerated that.

38:35.500 --> 38:37.800
I have got to get in there
and wash that smell out.

38:37.700 --> 38:40.500
Now, if you people refuse to do it,
then I'm just simply going to have to do it myself.

38:40.500 --> 38:43.500
- We just can't allow that right now, ma'am.
- I want that car disinfected.

38:43.400 --> 38:45.400
- I taught my son cleanliness.
- Mrs. Reese...

38:45.300 --> 38:47.600
Don't touch me!

38:47.600 --> 38:50.400
Just tell me what you are going
to do about Daniel's car.

38:54.300 --> 38:57.500
That's the smell.

38:57.500 --> 39:00.600
That's the murderer.
I smell him.

39:00.600 --> 39:03.000
- I'm God Almighty.
- Arrest that man.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.100
- He's under arrest, Mrs. Reese.
- I'm God Almighty.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.400
You shut up and be silent.
Do what you said.

39:11.700 --> 39:14.000
Oh, my God.

39:15.200 --> 39:17.900
My son is...

39:17.800 --> 39:21.400
My son is dead. Oh!

39:44.200 --> 39:46.800
This is the second refill, Andy.
Don't eat any more of these.

39:49.100 --> 39:52.800
And let him get to this his own way.
Don't turn this into an interrogation.

39:52.800 --> 39:57.900
All right. I'm only saying if it's drugs
or alcohol, I want you to leave the room.

39:57.800 --> 40:00.900
- Hey, Pop.
- Hey, Andy. Come on in.

40:00.900 --> 40:02.800
- Hi, Sylvia.
- Hi, Andy.

40:02.800 --> 40:04.700
Gee, you look beautiful.

40:04.700 --> 40:06.900
Well, got two and a half
more months to go.

40:06.900 --> 40:09.500
- Yeah, Dad was saying.
- So, what's going on?

40:09.500 --> 40:13.800
- Would you like something to drink?
- A Coke, please.

40:13.700 --> 40:15.700
Is that what you're drinking
these days- Coke?

40:15.600 --> 40:18.000
I mean, don't have something
different for my sake.

40:17.900 --> 40:20.500
Yeah, a-a Coke's good.

40:20.400 --> 40:23.800
Uh, come on in here.
Sit down. Here.

40:27.700 --> 40:30.600
All right. So, uh...

40:30.500 --> 40:33.300
So, what's going on, huh?
Your being so secretive...

40:33.300 --> 40:35.500
I figured you must have
killed somebody.

40:35.500 --> 40:39.500
I wasn't being secretive, Pop.
I, uh...

40:39.400 --> 40:43.100
But there's a couple things, and I wanted
to talk it all through with you.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.400
I just wish you'd have let me know
when we could have done something, huh?

40:46.300 --> 40:49.300
I mean, if somebody took
an irrational dislike.

40:49.200 --> 40:52.100
The first thing is- ahem-
I'm leaving the air force, Dad.

40:52.000 --> 40:55.500
See, there it is.
That's what I knew was comin'.

40:55.400 --> 40:58.600
I tore my rotator cuff.
But it's not that bad. Um...

40:58.600 --> 41:01.400
They-They can't
fix it with surgery.

41:01.300 --> 41:03.200
Anyways, I'm discharged.

41:03.300 --> 41:05.200
Your rotator cuff?

41:05.200 --> 41:07.300
No disciplinary aspect?

41:07.200 --> 41:12.500
No, uh-uh, no.
I got good evaluations and so forth.

41:12.300 --> 41:14.600
He tore his rotator cuff.

41:16.900 --> 41:20.300
Andy, I'm sorry. Uh...

41:20.300 --> 41:23.900
Hey, it's not that bad,
but I had to leave the service.

41:23.800 --> 41:26.100
And there's no disciplinary aspect.

41:26.000 --> 41:30.400
They give him all,
uh, great evaluations.

41:30.300 --> 41:32.800
Have you given any thought
to what you might do now?

41:32.800 --> 41:36.500
Well, the thing is,
even before I joined...

41:36.400 --> 41:40.100
I took the test for the department
in Hackensack.

41:40.000 --> 41:45.500
And they put me on a list. And in January
they wrote I'd been accepted for training.

41:45.300 --> 41:48.400
- Which department we talkin' about?
- The police department.

41:49.600 --> 41:51.700
I applied to be a cop.

41:51.700 --> 41:54.300
The police department?

41:54.200 --> 41:56.500
Yeah, and I got
in touch with them...

41:56.500 --> 41:59.700
and they hadn't
closed enrollment yet.

41:59.700 --> 42:04.500
- I start training next week.
- Congratulations. That's great.

42:04.400 --> 42:08.200
Yeah, I'm pretty pleased.
It's two months of classes.

42:08.200 --> 42:11.500
Then two months on-the-job training,
and then two more months of class.

42:11.400 --> 42:15.600
Your rotator cuff thing there,
that's not gonna impinge that?

42:15.600 --> 42:18.000
They said it wouldn't
disqualify me...

42:18.000 --> 42:21.500
so long as I pass the physical training test
at the end of six months.

42:21.400 --> 42:23.300
And you've thought this through,
the type of life.

42:23.300 --> 42:26.200
I think it's a good thing to be.

42:28.600 --> 42:32.000
I wanted to ask you...

42:31.900 --> 42:34.100
anytime you could give me
pointers and so on...

42:34.100 --> 42:36.400
I- I'd be really grateful for that.

42:37.800 --> 42:40.200
Uh, uniform cop, you know...

42:40.100 --> 42:42.400
it's different from a detective.

42:42.300 --> 42:44.300
Well, I-I know that much.

42:44.200 --> 42:46.600
But I was nine years a cop.

42:46.500 --> 42:50.200
Uh, I still can remember
a few things.

42:53.200 --> 42:57.200
- So, it's gonna be a boy, huh?
- And being back...

42:57.100 --> 43:00.100
you'll be able to spend more time
with your baby brother.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.800
Maybe change a few diapers even.

43:02.700 --> 43:06.000
- Hey, I'd be willin'.
- Good.

43:06.000 --> 43:10.900
- Well, I guess- Ready to eat?
- Sure.

43:10.800 --> 43:13.000
This baby is moving.

43:12.900 --> 43:15.300
- Like right now?
- Yeah.

43:16.700 --> 43:19.300
Do you wanna feel it?

43:20.200 --> 43:23.600
Here. Gimme your hand.

43:23.600 --> 43:26.400
It's right there.

43:26.400 --> 43:28.600
Wow.
