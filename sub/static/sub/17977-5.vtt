22:46.433 --> 22:48.100
ARE YOU GOING
TO BE OKAY?

22:48.133 --> 22:50.067
YEAH, I'M GOING
TO BE FINE.

22:50.067 --> 22:51.400
THEY, UM...

22:51.433 --> 22:54.133
UM...

22:57.067 --> 22:58.867
I'M HAVING A--
I--

22:58.900 --> 23:00.933
THEY-- THEY FOUND A LUMP
IN MY BREAST,

23:00.967 --> 23:02.600
AND SO I'M
HAVING IT REMOVED.

23:02.633 --> 23:03.600
IT'S ROUTINE.

23:03.633 --> 23:05.367
A LUMP?

23:05.400 --> 23:07.067
DID YOU HAVE
IT BIOPSIED?

23:07.067 --> 23:08.267
YEAH.

23:08.300 --> 23:09.633
WHAT DID THEY--
WHAT DID THEY FIND?

23:09.667 --> 23:10.900
IS IT BENIGN?

23:10.933 --> 23:14.567
IT'S JUST A LITTLE OPERATION,
REALLY, IT'S...

23:14.600 --> 23:15.633
EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

23:15.667 --> 23:17.233
EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

23:20.767 --> 23:21.900
YOU KNOW,
TINA HAD A LUMPECTOMY,

23:21.933 --> 23:24.433
AND YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE THE SCAR.

23:24.467 --> 23:26.567
[HELENA]: NO.
NO, YOU CAN'T.

23:28.333 --> 23:32.100
I MEAN, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THAT SHE'D HAD ONE.

23:33.833 --> 23:35.733
WELL, FUCK IT, WHAT TIME?

23:35.767 --> 23:37.767
YEAH, I THINK WE SHOULD ALL GO
AND SUPPORT YOU.

23:37.800 --> 23:39.300
WE SHOULD
ALL BE THERE.

23:39.333 --> 23:40.767
LARA'S GOING
TO BE THERE.

23:40.800 --> 23:41.700
IT'S FINE,
LARA'S GOING TO BE THERE.

23:41.733 --> 23:42.900
IT'S OKAY, REALLY.

23:42.933 --> 23:44.600
IT'S GOING
TO BE OVERNIGHT.

23:44.633 --> 23:45.800
I'LL BE OUT
THE NEXT DAY.

23:45.833 --> 23:46.867
OKAY?

23:46.900 --> 23:47.633
ARE YOU SURE?

23:47.667 --> 23:48.733
YES.

23:48.767 --> 23:49.467
IS THERE ANYTHING
WE CAN DO?

23:49.500 --> 23:50.467
YEAH-- NO.

23:50.500 --> 23:52.067
THANK YOU.

24:16.167 --> 24:18.100
SO, MOIRA...

24:18.133 --> 24:20.367
THAT'S A GIRL'S NAME,
ISN'T IT?

24:20.400 --> 24:21.367
YEAH.

24:21.400 --> 24:22.567
I'M A GIRL.

24:22.600 --> 24:23.767
I WASN'T SAYING

24:23.800 --> 24:25.400
I DIDN'T KNOW
IF YOU WERE A GIRL.

24:25.433 --> 24:26.633
I WAS JUST ASKING
ABOUT THE NAME.

24:26.667 --> 24:27.667
OH, SORRY.

24:31.667 --> 24:34.733
SO TELL ME A LITTLE
ABOUT YOUR LAST JOB, MOIRA,

24:34.767 --> 24:38.467
AT CHALDENE SOFTWARE,
SKOKIE, ILLINOIS.

24:38.500 --> 24:41.900
I WAS MOSTLY INVOLVED
IN CODING AND TESTING.

24:41.933 --> 24:44.633
WE DEVELOPED THIS SYSTEM
USING TCP/IP SOCKET,

24:44.667 --> 24:45.933
HTTP, CORBA--

24:45.967 --> 24:47.533
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

24:47.567 --> 24:50.367
UM, HOW ARE YOUR PROGRAMMING
SKILLS?

24:50.400 --> 24:52.133
MOSTLY I'M FAMILIAR

24:52.167 --> 24:55.733
WITH WINDOWS PLATFORMS
LIKE JAVA AND VISUAL OBJECTS,

24:55.767 --> 24:57.300
BUT I'M A REALLY FAST LEARNER,

24:57.333 --> 24:59.600
AND I'M REALLY GOOD AT
TROUBLESHOOTING AND DEBUGGING.

24:59.633 --> 25:01.367
AH...

25:01.400 --> 25:02.600
IT'S A GREAT
LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION

25:02.633 --> 25:04.567
FROM CHALDENE.

25:04.600 --> 25:07.167
HOW DID YOU GET ON
WITH THE FOLKS THERE?

25:07.200 --> 25:08.767
REALLY WELL.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.767
HUH, SO NO PROBLEMS
WITH YOU BEING...

25:10.800 --> 25:14.833
YOU KNOW, HARD TO PEG?

25:14.867 --> 25:17.067
HARD TO PEG?

25:20.867 --> 25:24.600
YOU'RE KIND OF
NEITHER FISH NOR FOWL, MOIRA,

25:24.633 --> 25:25.700
IF YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN.

25:25.733 --> 25:27.067
AND I'M NOT SAYING

25:27.067 --> 25:27.933
THAT WE WOULD
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST YOU,

25:27.967 --> 25:29.133
BECAUSE THAT
IS ONE THING

25:29.167 --> 25:31.767
THAT WE DON'T DO
HERE AT INTECHMODE,

25:31.800 --> 25:36.067
BUT WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE
WHO IS A TEAM PLAYER.

25:36.067 --> 25:37.667
WE'RE TEAM PLAYERS HERE.

25:37.700 --> 25:39.433
YEAH.

25:39.467 --> 25:41.133
I'M A TEAM PLAYER.

25:41.167 --> 25:44.400
WHAT SIDE DO YOU
BAT FOR, MOIRA?

25:44.433 --> 25:46.067
[LAUGHS]

25:46.067 --> 25:47.133
I'M KIDDING.

25:47.167 --> 25:48.200
I'M SORRY.

25:48.233 --> 25:50.900
IT WAS TOO GOOD
TO RESIST.

25:50.933 --> 25:52.700
YOU KNOW,
I THINK THE SCRIPT

25:52.733 --> 25:54.067
NEEDS A LITTLE MORE
REWRITING.

25:54.100 --> 25:55.100
YEAH, WE CAN DO THAT.

25:55.133 --> 25:56.633
THEN IT SHOULD BE FINE.

25:58.200 --> 26:01.500
UH, I GOT SOMETHING
FOR YOU.

26:08.600 --> 26:11.267
I BOUGHT THIS ON eBAY.

26:14.900 --> 26:16.133
OH, MY GOD.

26:16.167 --> 26:17.567
THAT'S MY FAVORITE MOVIE
OF ALL TIME.

26:17.600 --> 26:18.733
GOOD.

26:18.767 --> 26:21.433
JUST A LUCKY GUESS.

26:21.467 --> 26:23.900
IT'LL BE INSPIRATION
FOR OUR PROJECTS TOGETHER.

26:23.933 --> 26:25.833
WOW. WELL,
YOU SET THE BAR HIGH.

26:25.867 --> 26:28.533
YES, I DO.

26:31.333 --> 26:32.433
HERE YOU GO.

26:32.467 --> 26:33.600
THANKS.

26:33.633 --> 26:37.100
WOW. COOL.

26:37.133 --> 26:38.600
I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

26:38.633 --> 26:40.900
OKAY.

26:40.933 --> 26:42.833
BYE.

26:50.067 --> 26:52.900
GAME, SET, MATCH,
MISS FAIRBANKS.

26:52.933 --> 26:55.367
AND WHAT A GAME!

26:55.400 --> 26:57.167
DANA FAIRBANKS
HAS TAKEN IT TODAY

26:57.200 --> 27:00.133
IN THE MERCEDES-BENZ
CHALLENGE...

27:00.167 --> 27:01.300
[SNIFFLES]

27:01.333 --> 27:02.533
SHE'S DONE
A GREAT JOB SO FAR.

27:02.567 --> 27:04.200
SHE'S BEEN AMAZING
THIS YEAR.

27:04.233 --> 27:06.233
ABSOLUTELY.
CONGRATULATIONS.

27:06.267 --> 27:07.567
THE ENTIRE SEASON.
I AGREE WITH YOU--

27:07.600 --> 27:09.400
[CLICKS TELEVISION OFF]

27:12.267 --> 27:16.467
YOU OKAY?

27:16.500 --> 27:18.600
YEAH, I'M GREAT.

27:28.267 --> 27:30.067
BABY, I THINK YOU
SHOULD TELL YOUR FRIENDS

27:30.067 --> 27:32.067
WHAT'S REALLY
GOING ON.

27:34.267 --> 27:36.633
I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU DIDN'T.

27:36.667 --> 27:39.067
THEY DON'T NEED TO KNOW
EVERY LAST DETAIL.

27:43.333 --> 27:44.633
I JUST--
I DON'T THINK

27:44.667 --> 27:48.867
I SHOULD BE
THE ONLY ONE.

27:48.900 --> 27:50.567
THEY'VE KNOWN YOU
FOR A LONG TIME, BABY.

27:50.600 --> 27:52.100
THEY LOVE YOU.

27:52.133 --> 27:54.533
THEY WOULD WANT TO
BE THERE FOR YOU.

27:54.567 --> 27:56.133
IF THEY KNEW THAT
THIS WAS MORE SERIOUS--

27:56.167 --> 27:59.267
I TOLD THEM
WHAT I WANTED TO TELL THEM.

27:59.300 --> 28:01.567
OKAY?

28:08.833 --> 28:10.833
FUCK...

28:14.767 --> 28:17.533
[***]

28:25.500 --> 28:27.900
CHASE, HAVE YOU HEARD
FROM MY 6:00?

28:27.933 --> 28:31.200
OH, IT'S A SHERRY...

28:33.067 --> 28:34.300
SHERRY...

28:34.333 --> 28:35.333
YEAH.

28:35.367 --> 28:37.300
PERONI. SHE HASN'T CALLED.

28:37.333 --> 28:38.567
SHE'S FUCKING LATE.

28:38.600 --> 28:39.867
DO YOU WANT TO SET UP
THAT BOARD?

28:39.900 --> 28:40.867
WHAT, RIGHT NOW?

28:40.900 --> 28:42.300
YEAH.

28:42.333 --> 28:44.100
WELL, IF SHE HASN'T
SHOWN UP, YEAH, FOR SURE.

28:44.133 --> 28:45.733
JUST WAIT
A LITTLE BIT FOR HER.

28:49.067 --> 28:51.067
LOOKS LIKE
A SLAMMING PARTY.

28:51.100 --> 28:54.933
I'M SORRY I MISSED IT.

28:54.967 --> 28:56.067
CHERIE...

28:56.067 --> 28:57.500
WHAT THE FUCK...

28:57.533 --> 29:00.100
WELL, THAT'S A NICE WAY
TO GREET AN OLD FRIEND.

29:02.367 --> 29:04.067
YEAH, I'M SORRY, CHERIE.
HOW ARE YOU?

29:04.067 --> 29:06.367
GOOD.

29:06.400 --> 29:07.967
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

29:08.067 --> 29:10.367
I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT
TO GET MY HAIR CUT.

29:12.367 --> 29:15.300
YOU DON'T JUST DO
MOHAWKS, DO YOU?

29:15.333 --> 29:17.700
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
I'D LOOK TOO GOOD IN A MOHAWK.

29:17.733 --> 29:19.333
WAIT...

29:19.367 --> 29:21.333
SO YOU'RE "SHERRY PERONI"?

29:21.367 --> 29:23.567
I WENT BACK
TO MY MAIDEN NAME.

29:23.600 --> 29:26.433
I WASN'T GOING TO KEEP
THAT FUCKER'S NAME,

29:26.467 --> 29:28.800
BUT I...

29:28.833 --> 29:31.167
CERTAINLY KEPT
A SHITLOAD OF HIS MONEY.

29:38.300 --> 29:41.267
IS THIS WHERE YOU WANT ME?

29:42.400 --> 29:44.433
YEAH.

29:44.467 --> 29:46.767
THAT'S NOT BEING
SELF-CENTERED.

29:46.800 --> 29:48.400
JUST-- YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME
AT THE LAST MINUTE.

29:48.433 --> 29:50.267
YOU KNOW, WE HAD AN AGREEMENT.

29:50.300 --> 29:53.100
I THINK WORK TAKES PRIORITY
OVER A MEDITATION GROUP.

29:53.133 --> 29:55.800
IT'S NOT RIGHT, TINA.

29:55.833 --> 29:57.500
[CHUCKLES]

29:57.533 --> 30:00.867
WHEN DID YOU
GET THAT?

30:00.900 --> 30:04.033
IT'S VERY COMFORTABLE.

30:04.067 --> 30:05.667
WHO KNEW BUDDHISM
COULD BE SO EXPENSIVE?

30:05.700 --> 30:07.433
IT WASN'T THAT EXPENSIVE, TINA.

30:07.467 --> 30:10.933
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU NEEDED
SPECIAL CLOTHES TO MEDITATE.

30:12.300 --> 30:14.167
FUCK IT.

30:14.200 --> 30:15.733
YOU KNOW WHAT?

30:15.767 --> 30:18.367
IF IT MAKES YOU THAT
UNCOMFORTABLE, I'LL CHANGE.

30:18.400 --> 30:19.467
OKAY, I'LL RETURN IT.

30:19.500 --> 30:21.867
WHATEVER.

30:21.900 --> 30:24.400
DAMMIT...

30:24.433 --> 30:25.467
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, TINA?

30:25.500 --> 30:27.100
IN THE SEVEN-AND-A-HALF YEARS

30:27.133 --> 30:29.000
THAT I WAS THE SOLE WAGE EARNER
IN THIS HOUSEHOLD,

30:29.033 --> 30:31.700
I NEVER LORDED MONEY OVER YOU
THE WAY YOU DO ME.

30:34.533 --> 30:36.433
AND WE DIDN'T HAVE
A CHILD THEN.

30:36.467 --> 30:39.300
AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE
A $300 HAIRCUT.

30:41.067 --> 30:46.067
THE SCUMBAG LEFT ME
FOR HIS BOOKKEEPER.

30:46.100 --> 30:47.633
SHE'S ABOUT YOUR AGE.

30:47.667 --> 30:49.200
YEAH?

30:49.233 --> 30:50.933
WELL, I'M REALLY SORRY
TO HEAR THAT.

30:50.967 --> 30:52.567
NO, DON'T BE SORRY.

30:52.600 --> 30:54.267
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HIS FACE

30:54.300 --> 30:56.533
WHEN THE JUDGE AWARDED ME
HALF OF HIS COMPANY.

30:56.567 --> 31:01.067
WELL, AS LONG AS YOU'RE OKAY,
RIGHT?

31:07.600 --> 31:10.567
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL,
BY THE WAY.

31:10.600 --> 31:13.067
YOU KNOW,
YOU SHOULD COME OUT--

31:13.067 --> 31:14.367
HEY, BABY.

31:14.400 --> 31:15.567
THE RESERVATIONS CAME THROUGH
FOR TONIGHT.

31:15.600 --> 31:16.900
DO YOU WANT ME TO
WAIT FOR YOU OUT FRONT?

31:16.933 --> 31:18.367
UM, CARMEN,
THIS IS CHERIE.

31:18.400 --> 31:21.167
CHERIE, THIS
IS CARMEN.

31:21.200 --> 31:23.200
CARMEN?

31:26.667 --> 31:27.900
FUCK YOU.

31:29.833 --> 31:30.833
CARMEN...

31:32.267 --> 31:33.367
LET GO OF ME.

31:33.400 --> 31:34.533
STOP IT!

31:34.567 --> 31:35.967
HEY, CALM DOWN.
STOP!

31:36.067 --> 31:37.067
CALM DOWN. SHUT UP.

31:37.067 --> 31:38.067
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

31:38.067 --> 31:39.500
CHERIE JAFFE.

31:39.533 --> 31:40.300
I DIDN'T KNOW
SHE WAS COMING IN.

31:40.333 --> 31:41.167
BULLSHIT.

31:41.200 --> 31:42.300
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME?

31:42.333 --> 31:44.067
GO LOOK AT THE BOOK.

31:44.067 --> 31:44.900
GO LOOK AT MY BOOK
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME.

31:53.367 --> 31:54.967
SHERRY FUCKING PERONI.

31:55.067 --> 31:56.233
SHE BOOKED UNDER
A DIFFERENT NAME.

31:56.267 --> 31:57.133
WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO?

31:57.167 --> 31:58.533
HUH?

31:58.567 --> 31:59.500
OKAY, WHATEVER,
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

31:59.533 --> 32:00.500
TELL HER TO GO FUCK HERSELF!

32:06.067 --> 32:08.567
ACT LIKE YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

32:35.067 --> 32:36.067
DID I HEAR HER SAY

32:36.067 --> 32:37.133
THAT SHE WAS
YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

32:37.167 --> 32:38.333
YEAH...

32:39.800 --> 32:42.100
CONGRATULATIONS,
SHANE.

32:42.133 --> 32:43.833
SHE'S PRETTY...

32:43.867 --> 32:47.667
BUT NOT AS HOT AS YOU ARE.

32:50.333 --> 32:53.767
WHY DON'T YOU COME OUT
TO THE BEACH THIS WEEKEND?

32:53.800 --> 32:56.500
YOU CAN BRING THE GIRLFRIEND
IF YOU WANT,

32:56.533 --> 32:59.400
BUT...I'D RATHER SEE YOU
BY YOURSELF.

33:21.533 --> 33:25.567
WE MEDITATE
TO GET TO KNOW OURSELVES,

33:25.600 --> 33:32.567
TO BECOME INTIMATE
WITH WHO WE REALLY ARE.

33:32.600 --> 33:40.567
EACH OF US HAS A LONGING
FOR WHAT WE SENSE IS IMPORTANT.

33:40.600 --> 33:47.067
IT'S A PROCESS
OF GETTING SUBTLER AND SUBTLER,

33:47.067 --> 33:51.067
AND THEN SIMPLY SINKING...

33:51.067 --> 33:53.300
[***]

34:05.067 --> 34:10.467
...KNOWLEDGE OF OURSELVES,

34:10.500 --> 34:17.333
OF RECOGNIZING ON DEEPER
AND DEEPER LEVELS...

34:17.367 --> 34:21.100
THE LOVING AWARENESS,

34:21.133 --> 34:26.100
THE PRESENCE
THAT IS ALWAYS THERE

34:26.133 --> 34:31.700
NO MATTER WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON
IN YOUR LIFE.

34:31.733 --> 34:34.167
[***]

34:47.933 --> 34:50.900
HEY, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

34:50.933 --> 34:52.433
JUST CLEANING.

34:52.467 --> 34:54.067
STOP IT.

34:54.100 --> 34:56.300
YOU DON'T NEED
TO DO THAT.

34:56.333 --> 34:58.400
YEAH, I DO, ACTUALLY.

34:58.433 --> 34:59.833
WHY?

34:59.867 --> 35:02.900
BECAUSE I'M NOT MAKING
ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTION.

35:02.933 --> 35:04.567
OKAY.

35:06.433 --> 35:09.100
I AM GOING
TO HELP YOU.

35:09.133 --> 35:10.333

OKAY.

41:11.467 --> 41:14.867
HOW WAS
THE MEDITATION GROUP?

41:14.900 --> 41:16.933
DID YOU HAVE AN EPIPHANY
OR SOMETHING?

41:16.967 --> 41:20.667
IT WAS INTERESTING.

41:23.167 --> 41:24.467

41:29.133 --> 41:30.667
I LOVE VERMONT.

41:30.700 --> 41:34.300
I THOUGHT MAYBE
WE SHOULD GIVE IT A TRY.

MAYBE.

41:53.200 --> 41:54.567
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

41:54.600 --> 41:55.933
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

41:55.967 --> 41:58.767
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"HOW DID THAT HAPPEN"?

41:58.800 --> 42:01.700
SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY THINK
THAT I'M QUALIFIED.

42:01.733 --> 42:02.967
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO IMPLY

42:03.067 --> 42:05.567
THAT YOU WEREN'T QUALIFIED.
I...

42:05.600 --> 42:07.533
I JUST THOUGHT THAT YOU SAID

42:07.567 --> 42:10.100
THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE
ANOTHER MUSEUM POSITION.

42:10.133 --> 42:15.067

IF THEY OFFERED IT TO ME...

42:26.700 --> 42:28.733
I HAVE
A JOB HERE,

42:28.767 --> 42:31.567
A JOB I LOVE.

42:31.600 --> 42:35.167
IT PROBABLY PAYS MORE
THAN A MUSEUM POSITION.

42:38.200 --> 42:41.600
SO, UM...

42:41.633 --> 42:44.067
YOU'RE SAYING THAT

42:44.067 --> 42:49.700
IF I WERE NAMED
THE DIRECTOR OF THE WHITNEY,

42:49.733 --> 42:52.167
YOU WOULDN'T MOVE TO NEW YORK?

UNBELIEVABLE STAMINA.

44:39.067 --> 44:40.133
WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT?

44:40.167 --> 44:41.533
OKAY...

44:41.567 --> 44:43.667
VAMPIRES ARE IMMUNE TO DISEASE.

44:43.700 --> 44:45.400
THEY NEVER GET SICK.

44:45.433 --> 44:47.633
AM I SUPPOSED TO, LIKE...

44:47.667 --> 44:49.300
LIKE, EXPOSE HER
