How many variants are you using?

I matched the victim’s injuries
to each of the following possible scenarios:

26:34.552 --> 26:37.669
landing on two tires, one tire,

26:37.763 --> 26:40.675
upside down, back tire...

26:40.766 --> 26:42.722
and even on its side.

26:42.852 --> 26:47.221
How many injuries matched
the damage to the bicycle?
All of them but one.

26:47.356 --> 26:50.314
Which injury?
The internal decapitation.

26:50.401 --> 26:53.017
And for that to happen,
the chin would have to hit the ground...

26:53.112 --> 26:56.229
at a force of approximately
1,200 pounds per square inch.

26:56.324 --> 26:59.316
Now, no matter how I position him—

26:59.410 --> 27:01.526
The mandible remains uninjured.

27:01.621 --> 27:04.033
And look where the bike ends up.

27:04.123 --> 27:06.614
Exactly where the boy
said he found the bike.

27:06.709 --> 27:07.915

So our victim wasn’t killed
in the bicycle crash.

someone struck him in his chin,

broken glass on the roof.

Right.

28:01.597 --> 28:04.339
Which means the tooth
could not have come from our victim.

is used to treat chronic acne,

I used your design...

33:10.239 --> 33:13.151
and calculated every conceivable way...

33:13.242 --> 33:16.325
that he could’ve gotten enough speed
to cause the damage to the roof.

33:16.412 --> 33:18.528
But it doesn’t match.

33:22.418 --> 33:23.999
Oh, God.

33:24.128 --> 33:26.835
What?
He didn’t use that ramp.

33:26.922 --> 33:29.038
It wasn’t a jump
from building to building.

33:29.133 --> 33:31.749
Yeah, but he didn’t drop from the sky.

33:31.844 --> 33:33.505
Basically, he did.

33:33.596 --> 33:36.633
This is my fault.
He tried to use my other design.

33:36.724 --> 33:40.342
No, Staci.
Dustin wasn’t killed by the stunt.

33:41.478 --> 33:44.390
His body was dragged
to where he was found,

33:44.481 --> 33:46.096

You sure?

33:50.362 --> 33:52.523
How do you think he got up there?

33:54.116 --> 33:55.981
He made the jump from the ground.

33:56.076 --> 33:58.453
He launched himself
over 40 feet in the air?

33:58.537 --> 34:01.779
I didn’t think it was possible.
I told Dustin the design
was only theoretical.

34:01.874 --> 34:03.990
I did it for class,
and the teacher flunked me.

34:04.084 --> 34:06.291
Do you think that you can draw
the design for me?

34:06.378 --> 34:07.879
Sure.

34:09.757 --> 34:12.123
Well, the ramp is on the ground.

34:12.217 --> 34:14.629
He had to be going at least
40 miles an hour when he hit it...

34:14.720 --> 34:16.210
to get enough height.

34:16.347 --> 34:18.713
See?
Yeah, but nobody can get
that kind of speed on a bike.

34:18.849 --> 34:20.510
Not on that street.
I know.

34:20.601 --> 34:22.808
Someone had to tow him
to get a launch like that.

34:22.895 --> 34:26.387
And whoever it was would’ve been
the last person to see him alive.

34:32.237 --> 34:36.401

on Staci’s new ramp design.

34:37.284 --> 34:39.866

Oh, oh, oh. Aw!

34:39.953 --> 34:42.911
So it could’ve been
anyone with him that day.

34:42.998 --> 34:45.831
Anyone with a car
that can go 40 miles an hour.

34:45.918 --> 34:47.328
That rules out Henry Ford.

34:47.419 --> 34:50.957
But whoever struck him
left behind these threads of glass.

34:51.048 --> 34:54.666
Now, this is the glass thread
we found in the victim’s fractured mandible.

34:54.760 --> 34:57.752

we found in the mold.

- Exactly.

35:01.684 --> 35:03.595

35:03.686 --> 35:06.052
Good. What kind of glass
leaves thread like this?

35:06.146 --> 35:10.105
Fiberglass— the kind
of spun fiberglass used in casts.

35:10.192 --> 35:12.103
So, the murder weapon was a cast?

35:12.194 --> 35:15.482
When I was in that BMX park,
it seemed like everybody there
had a cast on his arm.

35:15.572 --> 35:18.780
What do we do, take samples
from every broken arm we can find?

35:18.867 --> 35:21.609

We’re not looking for a broken arm.

35:21.704 --> 35:23.820
- What do you mean?
- He was struck in the chin...

35:23.914 --> 35:27.077
by a blow that was strong enough
to cause internal decapitation.

35:27.167 --> 35:30.284
- He was kicked.
- He was totally kicked in the chin.

So Forensics found these
fiberglass fibers on the body.

So they’re remnants

was also found on your cast.

that it wasn’t my kick that killed him?

- I don’t know.

defense lawyers as far as I’m concerned.

how fast he was going
when he hit that ramp, dude.
