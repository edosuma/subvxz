no job history.

they decide to dump you in.
- Where am I?

- [ Laughs ]

- Should we shoot them?

00:26.660 --> 00:29.463

who used to inform on you

- Someone needs
your help, Michael.

[ Michael Narrating ]
As a spy, you have a lot
of ways to get information.

00:48.082 --> 00:50.951
You can get it with a gun.
You can get it
with a lockpick.

00:51.018 --> 00:52.753
You can get it
with a listening device.

00:52.820 --> 00:56.557
But most often, more than all
the other information-gathering
techniques combined,

00:56.624 --> 00:58.692

invite me to lunch
at places like this?

Oh, there's no need, Sam.
You'll do almost anything
for a three-dollar beer.

01:04.732 --> 01:07.601
Yeah, sure. Barry
tracks down a Cayman Island
bank account number,

01:07.668 --> 01:09.670
and he gets lunch
at the Chadwick?

01:09.737 --> 01:12.240
That number
leads to whoever
was trying to kill me.

01:12.306 --> 01:14.642
So, yes, the Chadwick.

01:14.708 --> 01:16.777
He's been complaining
about the job for days.

01:16.844 --> 01:19.813

to reduce Bly's career
to a smoldering crater.

Government agents have
to stay within the law,

plenty of options

is a lot easier...

Shut up.

34:54.360 --> 34:56.528
It's not important.

34:56.595 --> 35:00.532
One evening, a patient
was brought into my clinic
in the middle of the night.

35:00.599 --> 35:03.502
He was tortured so badly
I couldn't believe
he was still breathing.

35:03.569 --> 35:06.905
A man was with him.
It was the man
on your radio.

35:06.972 --> 35:08.674
I'll never forget the voice.

35:08.740 --> 35:11.076
He put a gun to my head
and explained to me...

35:11.143 --> 35:13.145
that my patient
had robbed him...

35:13.212 --> 35:16.182
and that he wanted me
to save him...

35:16.248 --> 35:18.150
so the pain
would last longer.

35:18.217 --> 35:20.118
I did what I could.

35:20.186 --> 35:22.854
He said to come here
for my money--
my blood money.

35:22.921 --> 35:25.357
There's a place
between life and death.

35:25.424 --> 35:27.959
Amazing how long
a man can linger there.

35:28.026 --> 35:30.962
That's enough.
All right? Okay.

35:31.029 --> 35:35.567

35:44.576 --> 35:48.480
I know this guy.
He'll have people
outside the bank,

35:48.547 --> 35:50.482
in your truck
and on your boat.

who you're dealing with.

Yeah, but he's a voice
on our radio.

36:00.091 --> 36:02.661
He's on our boat!
How does that happen?

36:02.728 --> 36:05.197
I mean,
what happened to the guys
in the vault, huh?

36:05.264 --> 36:07.266
He-He's talkin'
about our truck!

There's nothing wrong
with our truck!

I think we were deciding
whether we were going
to destroy each other.

of the loft...

it was the end.

were so brave, Madeline.

what are you doing?

leaving you alone

Don't get me wrong.
I love how I look

putting on a show,

Simple? Like wiring
a truck to blow?
An important task, yes,
