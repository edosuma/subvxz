WEBVTT

00:02.702 --> 00:05.830
Come check this out.
Look at all this stuff I found up in the attic.

00:06.006 --> 00:08.474
What? Wh... Why, that's my old trumpet.

00:08.641 --> 00:10.336
I haven't seen that thing in ages.
Ha-ha-ha.

00:10.510 --> 00:12.603
Oh, man,
I didn't know you played the trumpet.

00:12.779 --> 00:16.340
When I was in college a little bit, you know.
The girls all like a musician, you know?

00:23.456 --> 00:25.481
I met him after Princeton.

00:28.261 --> 00:29.853
Wow, look at all this stuff.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.964
My old coloring books.

00:32.131 --> 00:34.623
My diary.

00:34.801 --> 00:37.531
Wait a minute, I didn't have Barbie.
Who had a Barbie?

00:37.704 --> 00:42.198
Well, it's not mine. My Barbie's at home
fast asleep in her Barbie Dream House.

00:43.343 --> 00:44.537
Um...

00:44.811 --> 00:47.871
It doesn't matter whose it is.
Let me see this trumpet.

- Hey, hey, hey. Morning, everybody.
- Morning, Will.

02:07.827 --> 02:10.193
Oh. Y'all remember,
don't nobody mention to Carlton...

02:10.363 --> 02:12.763
...that William Shatner's
gonna be on Hilary's show.

02:12.932 --> 02:14.695
Don't you think you're being unfair?

02:14.868 --> 02:19.032
He's coming on the show
and you know Carlton is a huge fan of his.

02:19.205 --> 02:22.333
Who's gonna be on Hilary's show,
and who am I a huge fan of?

02:22.509 --> 02:25.034
Uh... Uh... Uh... Billy.

02:25.712 --> 02:26.736
Billy who?

02:26.913 --> 02:28.437
Uh...

02:28.615 --> 02:30.879
Uh... Uh... Uh... Billy Butterworth.

02:35.421 --> 02:37.616
You are never going to believe
what's happened.

02:37.790 --> 02:41.624
Oh, yeah. Billy Butterworth's gonna be
on your show. Big deal.

02:42.128 --> 02:45.256
What are you talking about?
William Shatner's on the show.

02:49.569 --> 02:54.063
Actor, director, novelist,
bon vivant William Shatner?

02:54.240 --> 02:55.434
And you knew?

02:55.608 --> 02:58.168
You slept in the same pool house
with me knowing this...

02:58.344 --> 03:01.438
...knowing what it would mean to me,
and you didn't say a word?

03:02.248 --> 03:05.115
I don't even know who you are.

03:06.686 --> 03:08.381
Look, Carlton, it ain't like I'm...

03:08.555 --> 03:10.853
Hello? I wasn't finished.

03:11.024 --> 03:13.891
- Hilary, you gotta introduce him to me.
- No.

03:14.060 --> 03:16.722
The network is so thrilled
with all of our great guests...

03:16.896 --> 03:18.557
...that they wanna move the show
to New York.

03:18.731 --> 03:19.857
- New York?
- Yeah.

03:20.033 --> 03:23.730
There was a meeting with the VIPs
and they think we're ready for the big time.

03:23.903 --> 03:27.703
Oh, wait, wait. Wait a minute, Hilary.
I can't just uproot just like that.

03:28.274 --> 03:29.832
Okay.

03:30.810 --> 03:32.038
What do you mean "okay?"

03:32.212 --> 03:34.407
- I'm gonna be out of a job.
- So come.

03:34.581 --> 03:37.106
Hilary, I can't come.
I still gotta finish school.

03:37.517 --> 03:39.815
- Okay.
- What...?

03:39.986 --> 03:42.682
Look, Hilary, how come
I didn't find out about this before?

03:42.855 --> 03:47.224
Oh, don't tell me someone
withheld information from somebody.

03:49.429 --> 03:53.195
So just like that, you're moving
to New York and I'm out of a job.

03:53.633 --> 03:54.759
Okay.

03:56.636 --> 03:57.660
What about New York?

03:57.837 --> 04:00.499
They're moving Hilary's show
to New York.

04:00.673 --> 04:02.834
Oh, my God, that's wonderful.

04:03.009 --> 04:05.705
This is the best news I've ever heard.
It's unbelievable.

04:05.878 --> 04:08.005
Ashley, you've never been
this happy for me.

04:08.181 --> 04:10.479
I still haven't been. This is about me.

04:10.950 --> 04:13.817
- I can still move to New York.
- Now, just hold on, young lady.

04:13.987 --> 04:17.218
You said I couldn't move to New York
and go to The School of Performing Arts...

04:17.390 --> 04:19.517
...because I couldn't move there
by myself.

04:19.692 --> 04:21.819
- But now that Hilary's going...
- Oh, we'll be roommates.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.094
Ashley. Ashley, calm down.

04:25.265 --> 04:28.325
There's more than that one reason
for your not moving to New York.

04:28.501 --> 04:30.059
- Like what?
- Uh...

04:30.236 --> 04:32.067
l... I think you know.

04:32.672 --> 04:36.108
<i>No, I don't. Come on. Up in Dad's office,
there's a Sunday New York Times.</i>

04:36.276 --> 04:38.437
We can find an apartment from there.

04:38.711 --> 04:43.648
Hey, hey, hey. Stay out of my office.
You can jump in here any time, Vivian.

04:43.816 --> 04:48.810
Perhaps that iron fist that you rule with
has gotten a bit rusty, sir.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.689
Perhaps I should hit something.

04:53.092 --> 04:55.492
Be careful of misguided anger, sir.

04:56.996 --> 05:01.296
<i>I'm gonna go down and have Shatner sign
my copy of his new book, Man o' War.</i>

05:01.467 --> 05:02.764
What to wear?

05:02.935 --> 05:05.495
What to wear?

05:05.838 --> 05:08.432
What to wear?

05:12.045 --> 05:16.311
Hil, I gotta let you know, I'm more than
a little upset about how you played me...

05:16.482 --> 05:20.418
...with this whole New York thing.
This is a wound that will not quickly heal.

05:21.087 --> 05:22.179
Okay.

05:24.424 --> 05:26.824
Hilary. I'm Dick West.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.654
- I'm with the network.
- Oh.

05:28.828 --> 05:31.991
We're just pleased as punch
to have you aboard, pretty lady.

05:32.165 --> 05:35.965
Oh, thank you.
We're really excited about New York.

05:36.135 --> 05:40.196
Everyone, I'd like you
to meet William Shatner.

05:41.107 --> 05:43.837
- How you doing? Will Smith.
- Nice to meet you.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.534
Pleasure to meet you.

05:45.712 --> 05:49.148
Bill, Bill, Bill, I'm Dick West.
I'm with the network.

05:49.315 --> 05:51.875
- Oh.
- I noticed you drove in today.

05:52.051 --> 05:54.611
Thought beaming down
would be too flashy, huh?

05:54.787 --> 05:56.846
Good one, Dick.

05:57.023 --> 06:00.288
- Thanks, guy. Hey, I'll catch you later, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

06:00.460 --> 06:03.156
What is it about these suits
that they feel they have to make...

06:03.329 --> 06:05.524
<i>...some lame Star Trek joke
when they start off?</i>

06:05.698 --> 06:07.666
- I don't unders...
- William Shatner.

06:09.869 --> 06:11.632
I saw your car out in the parking lot.

06:11.804 --> 06:16.002
I guess you thought beaming down
would be too flashy, huh? Get it, huh?

06:16.642 --> 06:18.610
That's a good one, Dick.

06:19.579 --> 06:22.742
- Well, actually, his name is Carlton.
- Who cares?

06:23.649 --> 06:27.983
<i>Boy, the Twilight Zones.
The Star Trek episodes. The movies.</i>

06:28.154 --> 06:30.918
<i>The TekWar books. T.J. Hooker. Huh.</i>

06:31.090 --> 06:35.424
How about that Heather Locklear?
Hubba, hubba.

06:38.231 --> 06:42.292
Listen, now, you don't have
to shoot anything for the next three hours.

06:42.468 --> 06:45.869
- Anything you wanna do?
- Yeah, get away from this guy.

06:49.208 --> 06:52.143
Look, everybody, I just bought
my first winter coat and mittens.

06:52.311 --> 06:56.008
And I got long underwear, wool socks,
scarves and earmuffs.

06:56.182 --> 06:58.582
That's great.
It'll keep you nice and warm.

06:58.751 --> 07:01.811
Warm?
It doesn't get that cold in California.

07:02.321 --> 07:05.552
- Daddy, it's for New York.
- Yes, but you're not going to New York.

07:05.725 --> 07:07.784
Ooh.
And I got these great fleece-lined boots.

07:07.960 --> 07:09.951
Oh, these are beautiful.

07:10.396 --> 07:13.160
Ashley, is New York
as far away as Disneyland?

07:13.332 --> 07:16.062
Nicky. Nicky.
Sweetheart, she's not going to New York.

07:16.235 --> 07:19.693
- I know. Can I come visit you?
- Yes.

07:20.139 --> 07:23.108
- I remember my first visit to New...
- Vivian.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.210
- Mexico.

07:25.878 --> 07:28.472
Ah. New Mexico. Heh.

07:28.915 --> 07:33.648
Nothing like taking a bite of the Big Ap...
Tostada.

07:35.655 --> 07:39.147
I am not losing both my daughters.

07:39.325 --> 07:41.691
She's my baby girl, Vivian.

07:41.861 --> 07:43.658
Daddy, you're not losing us.

07:43.830 --> 07:45.491
You'll know exactly where we are.

07:45.665 --> 07:47.132
We'll be in New York.

07:47.767 --> 07:49.962
- Let's go see what your sister bought.
- Yeah.

07:50.136 --> 07:51.694
You are not going to New York.

07:51.871 --> 07:54.362
Vivian. Vi...
She's not going to New York.

07:54.540 --> 07:56.770
You are not going to New York.
Did you hear...?

07:56.943 --> 07:59.776
I'm your fath...
You're not going to New York.

08:05.785 --> 08:08.151
She's not going to New York.

08:11.357 --> 08:12.722
Oh.

08:13.392 --> 08:15.360
All right. Best three out of five.

08:15.528 --> 08:18.691
All right,
you wanna keep taking this here whooping.

08:18.865 --> 08:20.958
Most people are intimidated by me.

08:21.133 --> 08:22.725
They let me win.

08:26.038 --> 08:29.735
Very funny, Will,
giving me the wrong address.

08:36.982 --> 08:41.510
Hello, Mr. William Shatner.

08:41.754 --> 08:43.414
Hey.

08:43.655 --> 08:46.454
All right. Look, now, you can stay here
and you can hang out.

08:46.626 --> 08:48.116
But remember the rules.

08:48.694 --> 08:50.491
All right, I won't talk.

08:50.663 --> 08:51.687
I promise.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.290
And?

08:54.534 --> 08:58.561
And if I feel myself getting overexcited,
I take a time out.

08:58.738 --> 08:59.932
All right.

09:00.573 --> 09:02.165
Now go sit down somewhere.

09:10.383 --> 09:11.941
Oh, I don't need a time out.

09:12.118 --> 09:13.380
I don't need a time out.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.647
I'm sorry, Will, I can't help it.

09:16.822 --> 09:20.485
I forgot to ask you this at the studio,
but would you please sign this picture?

09:20.660 --> 09:24.152
Just make it out to, "Carlton,
my best friend on Earth, bar none."

09:24.330 --> 09:28.596
<i>I can't. I have this arrangement with the
people who do the Star Trek conventions.</i>

09:28.768 --> 09:30.759
I have to charge you $50.

09:31.270 --> 09:32.897
But I don't have $50.

09:33.072 --> 09:34.903
- Would you take a check?
- No.

09:35.641 --> 09:39.202
Try and cash it at the bar.
And while you're there, get me a drink.

09:39.912 --> 09:45.714
Coming right up, Mr. William Shatner.

09:46.319 --> 09:49.811
You know that cousin of yours
is really attractive.

09:49.989 --> 09:51.650
Carlton?

09:52.124 --> 09:55.890
- No, no, no. Not him.
- I mean, he cute but I ain't never really...

09:56.062 --> 09:57.188
Your cousin Hilary.

09:57.363 --> 09:59.593
Oh. Oh. Heh. Better watch it.

09:59.765 --> 10:02.461
Hilary be taking aerobics
and stuff like that. It might hurt you.

10:02.635 --> 10:03.795
Aerobics. Ha.

10:03.970 --> 10:05.494
That sounds good.

10:05.671 --> 10:07.400
Well, nope, she's off limits, anyway.

10:07.573 --> 10:10.838
She's taking her show to New York.
I'm out of a job.

10:11.010 --> 10:12.739
She ain't even warn me.

10:12.912 --> 10:14.504
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

10:14.680 --> 10:16.841
I've been canceled a time or two myself.

10:17.016 --> 10:19.041
Always led to something better.

10:19.218 --> 10:22.881
I mean, remember, as long you've got a job,
you do the best job you can.

10:23.055 --> 10:26.650
And look at you, you're a bright guy.
You'll bounce back on your feet.

10:26.826 --> 10:28.453
Hey, thanks a lot, man.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.290
Hey, you wouldn't happen
to know anybody, would you?

10:31.897 --> 10:33.694
We move in different circles.

10:35.935 --> 10:38.927
- Here you go.
- Thanks. Now sit back down.

10:40.072 --> 10:43.200
Will, I wanna play pool too.

10:43.376 --> 10:44.604
No.

10:44.777 --> 10:46.267
Come on, just one shot.

10:46.445 --> 10:49.642
I wanna be able to say
that I shot pool with William Shatner.

10:49.815 --> 10:51.908
Carlton, he doesn't like you.

10:52.652 --> 10:56.110
How could he like you more than me?
You haven't even read any of his books.

10:56.288 --> 10:59.849
- He doesn't care about any of that stuff.
- Well, I do. Now give me the stick.

11:00.026 --> 11:01.653
- Let go. Let go.
- Give me the stick.

11:01.927 --> 11:03.918
Oh! Oh.

11:04.096 --> 11:05.529
My tooth.

11:05.698 --> 11:07.689
You broke my tooth.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.974
My tooth. You broke my damn tooth.

11:16.142 --> 11:18.269
Oh. I'm sorry.
We can get you right to the dentist.

11:18.444 --> 11:20.309
- Stand back. Stand back.
- All right.

11:20.479 --> 11:23.471
Don't worry, Jim.
We'll get you there warp speed.

11:23.649 --> 11:24.843
Get a life.

11:25.384 --> 11:29.684
<i>I know a dentist. We can get you there,
have you fixed in time for The Hilary Show.</i>

11:29.855 --> 11:30.913
I'm not doing any show.

11:31.090 --> 11:33.888
This is my mistake.
You can't take this out on my cousin.

11:34.060 --> 11:37.223
I can take it out on anyone I want.
I'm William Shatner.

11:39.432 --> 11:40.797
Will.

11:40.966 --> 11:44.732
Did you sense the power in that man?

11:46.105 --> 11:47.697
Shut up.

11:57.850 --> 11:59.408
- He's in here.
- Oh, great.

11:59.585 --> 12:02.179
Listen, Will,
I'm gonna hop in the chair with him.

12:02.354 --> 12:04.515
Take a picture. Quick.

12:05.891 --> 12:07.415
Carlton.

12:07.660 --> 12:10.220
No. Would you stop acting stupid?

12:10.763 --> 12:15.359
Hey, Mr. Shatner, look, I'm really sorry
that I busted your tooth, man.

12:15.534 --> 12:18.196
But can you please come with us
to do my cousin Hilary's show?

12:23.209 --> 12:24.233
Well...

12:24.410 --> 12:28.141
Look, you know, this is my mistake and
I don't want you to take it out on Hilary.

12:28.314 --> 12:30.111
This is really, really important to her.

12:36.322 --> 12:39.951
Oh, man. Carlton, he all hyped up
on that goofy gas. Man, turn that thing off.

12:40.126 --> 12:41.218
Oh, boy.

12:44.530 --> 12:47.988
- Mm.
- I don't know how to work this thing.

12:48.167 --> 12:50.260
Look, come on. Come on. Snap out of it.

12:50.569 --> 12:52.264
"Hangding."

12:53.639 --> 12:55.402
Carlton, he ain't snapping out of it, man.

12:56.942 --> 13:00.469
- I thought this room was empty.
- You was wrong then, wasn't you, brother?

13:00.646 --> 13:03.206
All right, this what we gonna do.
I'm gonna pick him up.

13:03.382 --> 13:06.977
I'm gonna put him over my shoulder,
carry him out. But you go out there first.

13:07.153 --> 13:10.122
I need you to stay there.
Make sure that the coast is clear...

13:15.127 --> 13:17.357
Carlton? Carlton, what is the ma...?

13:17.530 --> 13:19.964
What is the matter with you, man?

13:20.366 --> 13:22.300
Carlton, would you stop playing?

13:22.468 --> 13:24.595
Come on, this is serious, man.

13:52.364 --> 13:54.264
Hey, Bill, look.

13:55.234 --> 13:57.725
I'm Timmy the Tooth.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.229
Hi, Timmy.

14:00.406 --> 14:03.967
Wait, wait, wait. I wanna be Timmy.
Let me be Timmy.

14:04.476 --> 14:06.444
Whoo!

14:08.614 --> 14:11.777
Hey, hey. You Timmy the tooth.
I'm Bubba Gump.

14:18.958 --> 14:21.688
Hey, wait. Wait. Wait a second.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.260
Hey, Carlton, look.

14:23.429 --> 14:25.693
Uncle Phil's toothbrush.

14:28.701 --> 14:33.104
Hey, come on, let's brush.
Let's brush. Let's brush.

14:34.206 --> 14:36.640
Oh, wait, wait. Hold on. Now, let's rinse.

14:36.809 --> 14:39.277
We gotta rinse it off.

14:42.848 --> 14:47.080
Will, wait. Wait.
I got an idea. I got an idea. I got an idea.

14:49.922 --> 14:52.447
Let's brush his teeth.

14:53.425 --> 14:56.986
No. No, no. I got a better idea.

14:57.162 --> 14:58.686
Let's pick him clean.

14:59.765 --> 15:01.756
Oh, my God.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.226
Oh! Whoa!

15:05.404 --> 15:07.964
Spock, is that you?

15:08.540 --> 15:10.906
Your ears are the same
but something's different.

15:12.444 --> 15:16.278
Uhura. Hey, open up the hailing frequency.

15:16.749 --> 15:20.014
Captain, the dilithium crystals
are almost gone.

15:20.185 --> 15:24.349
The matter/antimatter reactors
are failing.

15:24.523 --> 15:28.186
Scotty, you're black.

15:29.428 --> 15:32.124
The bridge, it's changed.

15:32.464 --> 15:35.194
Spasers on spun.

15:35.834 --> 15:38.268
Oh, my tooth. Bones, fix it.

15:38.771 --> 15:42.366
Damn it, Jim.
I'm a black boy from Philly, not a doctor.

15:55.754 --> 15:58.154
Will, where have you been?

15:58.324 --> 16:00.019
And where is Mr. Shatner?

16:00.192 --> 16:03.184
He went... Oh. He...

16:04.530 --> 16:07.328
Yo, Billy. Where you at, boy?

16:07.499 --> 16:09.694
Here I go, dog.

16:09.868 --> 16:11.096
Here you go, brother.

16:11.270 --> 16:12.703
<i>Throw your hands in the air</i>

16:12.871 --> 16:14.270
<i>If you's a true player</i>

16:19.511 --> 16:22.674
This guy kills me. He's killing me.

16:23.515 --> 16:24.914
Will...

16:25.084 --> 16:27.848
...what did you do to him?
- Nothing.

16:28.020 --> 16:30.887
Hey, Werner, I just wanna say...

16:31.056 --> 16:32.887
...I love you, man.

16:35.227 --> 16:39.926
Sulu, where you been?
And why are you out of uniform?

16:41.700 --> 16:43.668
I never liked that guy.

16:44.103 --> 16:47.869
Mr. Shatner, look, I don't know
what it is that this man has done to you.

16:48.040 --> 16:49.871
But whatever it is, I apologize...

16:50.042 --> 16:53.443
...and I hope we can just work it out
without any legal action.

16:53.879 --> 16:56.177
What you talking about?
This guy loves us, right?

16:56.348 --> 16:58.543
Absolutely. I'll see you in court.

17:00.886 --> 17:04.117
Everybody, rumba.

17:04.289 --> 17:07.087
- Rumba.
- Rumba.

17:09.928 --> 17:13.295
- Thirty seconds for Mr. Shatner.
- Mr. Shatner is not quite ready for air.

17:13.464 --> 17:16.332
What do you mean not ready?
Do you know who you're talking to?

17:16.502 --> 17:18.970
That's right, boy. You better recognize.

17:19.137 --> 17:21.002
Mr. Shatner, I didn't mean...

17:21.173 --> 17:23.733
No, no. You better not had meant,
I know you ain't mean.

17:23.909 --> 17:25.001
Smarten up, Opie.

17:25.644 --> 17:29.171
I may be in an altered state right now
but when those cameras are on me...

17:29.348 --> 17:33.648
...and those lights hit me,
I'll be 100 percent dope.

17:33.819 --> 17:37.050
- Oh!
- That's right, homey.

17:37.222 --> 17:40.350
It's all good. It's all good.

17:43.629 --> 17:45.620
It's all good.

17:46.965 --> 17:49.024
Works for me.
Let's get him on the stage.

17:49.201 --> 17:51.066
Okay, posse, this way.

17:51.236 --> 17:53.397
- No, no, no.
- What do you mean "no, no, no"?

17:53.572 --> 17:55.836
This way. This way. This way.

18:04.049 --> 18:06.313
<i>Hello, and welcome to Hilary.</i>

18:06.485 --> 18:10.114
<i>Please give a warm Hilary welcome
to actor, director...</i>

18:10.289 --> 18:15.886
<i>...and author of this new and exciting book,
Man o' War, William Shatner.</i>

18:21.066 --> 18:24.832
William Shatner,
what would you like to talk about?

18:25.471 --> 18:28.497
Girl, you a bad mamma jamma.

18:29.641 --> 18:30.869
I know.

18:32.678 --> 18:37.377
Oh, that goofy gas gave me such
a headache.

18:37.549 --> 18:41.144
Oh, look, I just wanna apologize
for everything that I put you through.

18:41.320 --> 18:43.788
The least I could've done
was let you beat me at pool.

18:43.956 --> 18:47.221
Whoa, wait a minute. Beat me at pool.
You never beat me at pool.

18:48.193 --> 18:51.185
Oh, Bill, Bill, Bill.

18:51.363 --> 18:54.264
I see you still got your buzz on
a little bit, huh?

18:54.433 --> 18:57.402
Listen, I can beat you at pool anytime,
any place, any planet.

18:57.569 --> 19:00.470
Don't let your mouth write a check
your pool stick can't cash.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.266
- That sounds like a challenge.
- Yes.

19:02.441 --> 19:04.375
Well, put your hand there.

19:04.543 --> 19:06.238
- You call me sometime.
- All right.

19:06.411 --> 19:08.276
Okay.

19:10.849 --> 19:12.680
And captain...

19:12.851 --> 19:15.479
...live long and prosper.

19:16.955 --> 19:19.583
Hey, what about my autograph?

19:22.861 --> 19:25.056
Oh, look.
This one's on the Upper East Side.

19:25.230 --> 19:27.425
Oh, the shopping there is unbelievable.

19:27.599 --> 19:29.931
This is the happiest I've ever been.

19:30.102 --> 19:31.569
Ashley?

19:31.737 --> 19:34.035
Sweetheart, I've been doing
a lot of thinking...

19:34.206 --> 19:36.504
...and there's no reason
for you to be so down.

19:38.577 --> 19:40.704
I've decided...

19:40.879 --> 19:42.904
Are you ready for this?

19:44.116 --> 19:46.050
- to let you move to New York.

19:47.386 --> 19:50.981
- But, Daddy...
- Honey, honey, let him have this one.

19:53.325 --> 19:55.122
Oh, thank you, Daddy.

19:58.864 --> 20:02.630
- I'm telling you, Will. He liked me more.
- I believe you, Carlton.

20:02.801 --> 20:04.701
He did like me more. He did.

20:05.204 --> 20:09.573
Okay. Y'all was like brothers
and I was really jealous.

20:10.609 --> 20:13.772
Now, doesn't the truth
make you feel better?

20:16.748 --> 20:19.273
Will, I know that the show's moving
to New York...

20:19.451 --> 20:21.146
...came as kind of a surprise to you...

20:23.288 --> 20:26.485
...but I just wanna let you know
that if you ever change your mind...

20:26.658 --> 20:29.388
<i>...there'll always be a place for you
at The Hilary Show.</i>

20:31.930 --> 20:34.091
Hey, well, thanks a lot, Hil.

20:34.266 --> 20:36.996
You know, but you don't have
to worry about me, you know.

20:37.169 --> 20:40.138
Because by then, you know,
I'll probably have my own show.

20:40.606 --> 20:43.166
Yeah. You know,
because I might be unemployed now...

20:43.342 --> 20:47.540
...but I'm the type of brother
you can't keep down.

20:48.013 --> 20:49.640
Okay.

20:51.450 --> 20:54.248
You know,
because in the face of adversity...

20:54.419 --> 20:58.082
...you know, that's when Will Smith,
you know, really shines.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.851
You know, that's...
You know, because I'm at my best.

21:01.026 --> 21:03.256
Adversity put me in all my glory.

21:03.428 --> 21:06.591
Adversification, but...

21:09.534 --> 21:11.195
You know, it's really good to see...

21:11.370 --> 21:14.100
...how much this family cares about
what we think and feel.

21:14.273 --> 21:18.334
It sure is. I mean, you should have seen
how Ashley felt about what I thought.

21:18.510 --> 21:22.207
Yeah. You should have saw how Hilary
was acting about, you know, my future.

21:22.381 --> 21:25.839
She was worried. Yeah.
We got a lot to be thankful for, man.

21:26.018 --> 21:28.714
- Yeah, we sure do. We sure do.
- Yeah.

21:28.887 --> 21:30.855
I lost my job, you lost your daughter.

21:31.023 --> 21:32.718
- Two daughters.
- Two of them. Deuce. Deuce.

21:34.660 --> 21:36.252
Yeah.

21:36.695 --> 21:39.357
Oh, yeah, I got a lot to be thankful for.

21:39.531 --> 21:41.590
Yeah, man.

21:41.767 --> 21:43.667
- Yeah.
- Shoot.

21:48.774 --> 21:50.901
Will you hold me?
