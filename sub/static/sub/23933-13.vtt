00:10.950 --> 00:12.019
(Episode 13)

00:13.820 --> 00:16.489
You aren't married yet,\Nare you?

00:17.430 --> 00:18.559
I had been married.

00:19.659 --> 00:21.430
Now I'm divorced.

00:23.199 --> 00:24.370
I'm sorry.

00:24.999 --> 00:27.940
I thought I'd introduce\Nsomeone nice to you.

00:28.440 --> 00:30.310
I'm not interested\Nin love.

00:33.909 --> 00:35.539
Without love,

00:36.810 --> 00:39.780
there is no reason to live\Nin this harsh world.

00:42.319 --> 00:44.689
Is love\Nsomething that intense?

00:45.389 --> 00:46.889
Have you never\Nbeen in love?

00:48.319 --> 00:49.789
I'm not sure...

00:50.389 --> 00:51.929
if it's love or not.

00:53.800 --> 00:54.929
I'm sorry...

00:55.929 --> 00:57.130
about what happened\Nto your parents.

00:57.869 --> 00:59.700
I wanted to catch\Nthe culprits.

01:01.770 --> 01:02.869
But I couldn't.

01:04.840 --> 01:07.179
It's impossible\Nnot to notice love.

01:07.609 --> 01:09.609
Because it's such\Nan intense feeling.

01:11.679 --> 01:14.250
I don't want you\Nto get hurt because of me.

01:16.149 --> 01:18.020
You can't do it alone.\NLet's do it together.

01:18.020 --> 01:19.050
We'll find him together.

01:20.619 --> 01:22.190
This isn't like you.

01:22.619 --> 01:24.630
It's not over\Nuntil it's over.

01:26.360 --> 01:27.399
Let's go.

01:31.270 --> 01:32.300
We're...

01:32.869 --> 01:36.100
always together,\Nand we always...

01:36.809 --> 01:38.210
help each other.

01:39.440 --> 01:41.509
That's friendship.

01:45.110 --> 01:46.210
I don't like it...

01:46.720 --> 01:50.619
when someone I like\Nknows me too well.

01:51.250 --> 01:52.390
If you love someone,

01:53.319 --> 01:55.960
you'd want to know\Neven his worst traits.

01:56.960 --> 01:59.490
Nobody's worst trait\Nis beautiful.

02:04.630 --> 02:08.470
(Queen of Mystery 2)

02:09.910 --> 02:13.539
He was shot, so he's not\Non Secretary Kim's side.

02:13.539 --> 02:15.939
Thanks for\Nall your help today.

02:17.080 --> 02:18.710
We're a team,\Nso it's nothing.

02:18.950 --> 02:21.020
Thank goodness\Nyou didn't get hurt much.

02:21.349 --> 02:22.679
Looking at your face,

02:22.820 --> 02:23.950
I thought\Nyou were going to die.

02:25.219 --> 02:27.960
I didn't get hurt much,\Nbut I'm still in pain.

02:28.719 --> 02:29.960
The bullet grazed\Nmy thigh,

02:29.960 --> 02:31.159
the most painful area.

02:31.330 --> 02:33.830
I see.\NLet's go home first.

02:34.300 --> 02:36.059
I don't know whom\Nyou were going to meet,

02:36.570 --> 02:38.099
but it seems like he isn't\Nan ordinary guy.

02:38.629 --> 02:40.399
He wasn't caught on the\Nsecurity camera at all.

02:41.439 --> 02:42.499
Let's go.

02:46.240 --> 02:47.640
Number seven.

03:06.800 --> 03:09.300
He removed\Nevery security camera...

03:09.300 --> 03:11.399
in the area of action\Nfrom number seven.

03:23.309 --> 03:24.309
What is it?

03:24.679 --> 03:26.950
You deserted me\Nin the middle...

03:26.950 --> 03:27.950
of a highway.

03:28.179 --> 03:30.749
People will think that\NI actually did that.

03:31.089 --> 03:33.119
I dropped you off\Nat a rest stop.

03:33.960 --> 03:35.320
Same difference.

03:35.760 --> 03:36.790
Gosh.

03:38.189 --> 03:39.800
What are you doing?

03:40.999 --> 03:42.899
Stop pulling my shirt.

03:45.969 --> 03:48.499
I'm sorry. When you were\Nbuying potatoes,

03:48.499 --> 03:50.770
Secretary Kim was\Nabout to run away.

03:51.010 --> 03:52.640
He got scared when\Nhe heard I'm coming.

03:53.980 --> 03:55.540
Did you meet\NSecretary Kim?

03:56.679 --> 03:58.679
No, the one who saw him\Nran away.

04:00.349 --> 04:01.980
Don't make\Nany more excuses.

04:02.080 --> 04:04.219
I know you're trying to\Nlie to me.

04:04.219 --> 04:06.760
I can't lie to you\Neven if I wanted to.

04:10.960 --> 04:12.159
Did you meet...

04:13.399 --> 04:15.800
Secretary Kim or not?

04:16.670 --> 04:18.029
I met Inspector Woo.

04:18.529 --> 04:19.599
What?

04:20.269 --> 04:21.269
Inspector Woo!

04:23.810 --> 04:24.909
How did you...

04:24.909 --> 04:26.039
Let's go.

04:26.380 --> 04:27.909
He was going to meet\NSecretary Kim,

04:27.909 --> 04:29.180
so I followed him.

04:29.609 --> 04:30.909
But Secretary Kim\Nwasn't there.

04:31.250 --> 04:32.649
Why was Inspector Woo...

04:33.250 --> 04:34.880
after Secretary Kim?

04:36.020 --> 04:37.450
I don't know.\NHe wouldn't tell me,

04:37.450 --> 04:38.620
so I have no idea.

04:38.620 --> 04:41.190
Look into it, will you?\NYou live with him.

04:41.520 --> 04:43.489
I'm having a hard time\Nbecause of you.

04:43.930 --> 04:45.930
Why did you get me a room\Nin his place?

04:46.399 --> 04:47.560
Cook for him.

04:47.560 --> 04:49.630
Clean his place,\Nand get to know him.

04:50.700 --> 04:53.099
I guess you aren't\Nthe type...

04:53.099 --> 04:55.500
who can do that.\NI should do it.

04:55.940 --> 04:57.310
I'll just ask him out\Nfor a drink...

04:57.310 --> 04:58.669
and make him get drunk\Nwith mixed liquor.

04:58.669 --> 04:59.779
Why would you do that?

05:00.310 --> 05:01.880
I'm his roommate.\NI should do it.

05:03.080 --> 05:04.310
You do that then.

05:06.180 --> 05:07.219
By the way,

05:07.219 --> 05:09.820
the perverts\Nin this neighborhood...

05:09.820 --> 05:10.890
are gone.

05:11.719 --> 05:12.789
They've been quiet lately.

05:12.789 --> 05:13.859
It's too cold for them\Nto be out.

05:13.859 --> 05:15.089
They're humans too.

05:15.159 --> 05:16.659
When it gets warm...

05:23.799 --> 05:25.930
The cherry blossoms\Nhave to be in full bloom.

05:26.169 --> 05:28.099
Then they'd...

05:29.469 --> 05:30.609
Is that right?

05:32.609 --> 05:33.680
That's strange.

05:43.190 --> 05:44.719
(Joongjin Police Station)

05:51.159 --> 05:52.289
Mr. Gye.

05:52.430 --> 05:53.560
Ms. Yoo.

05:54.560 --> 05:56.229
What is it?

05:57.899 --> 05:59.430
I see you come to work\Nearly...

05:59.430 --> 06:00.870
since you are the top\Nofficer of this station.

06:02.700 --> 06:05.140
You shouldn't\Nkeep doing this.

06:05.140 --> 06:06.580
You didn't answer\Nmy phone calls.

06:06.580 --> 06:09.710
I told you\NI blocked your number.

06:10.109 --> 06:11.649
What you're doing\Nis stalking.

06:12.010 --> 06:13.580
I just need a minute\Nof your time.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.750
Mr. Gye.

06:19.919 --> 06:21.919
I'm a busy man!

06:33.140 --> 06:34.270
Lee Yeong Sook...

06:35.399 --> 06:37.669
watched that house\Nuntil morning,

06:38.640 --> 06:41.239
but Jang Myung Hoon\Ndidn't come out at all.

06:41.710 --> 06:43.710
It wasn't Jang Myung Hoon.

06:44.409 --> 06:47.279
If it was, I would've\Nrecognized him.

06:48.080 --> 06:51.219
Because I waited for him\Nall night.

06:51.489 --> 06:54.060
At 4:30am on March 21,\Nsomeone saw him...

06:54.620 --> 06:57.890
leaving the house\Nwith a huge suitcase.

06:59.130 --> 07:01.000
His face wasn't seen.

07:01.200 --> 07:02.399
It's just a conjecture.

07:02.830 --> 07:05.330
What about his key\Nthat was seen here?

07:05.529 --> 07:09.539
His key was seen, not Jang\NMyung Hoon himself.

07:10.710 --> 07:12.710
That's weird.\NThen who was it?

07:12.870 --> 07:14.580
It wasn't Jang Myung Hoon.

07:15.479 --> 07:17.149
But he left the house...

07:18.180 --> 07:21.580
with a huge and heavy\Nsuitcase.

07:27.159 --> 07:28.260
It was the murderer.

07:30.890 --> 07:33.729
She said it was\Na huge suitcase.

07:34.260 --> 07:35.630
It was so big...

07:36.130 --> 07:37.729
that it could fit\Na corpse.

07:40.640 --> 07:43.010
- A corpse?\N- A human resources...

07:43.339 --> 07:44.609
office can be messy...

07:44.609 --> 07:46.880
with cement powder or\Nconstruction waste.

07:47.580 --> 07:50.510
It wouldn't be difficult\Nto hide a corpse there.

07:52.080 --> 07:55.349
You're really imaginative.

07:56.549 --> 07:59.190
That suitcase\Nwas found here...

07:59.859 --> 08:01.460
when we searched\Nthis place.

08:14.370 --> 08:17.370
There were no blood stains\Non the suitcase.

08:21.010 --> 08:22.380
What about fingerprints?

08:22.380 --> 08:23.710
Too many fingerprints\Noverlapped...

08:23.710 --> 08:24.909
that it was hard\Nto detect.

08:25.479 --> 08:27.680
You searched\Nthe whole place,

08:28.020 --> 08:29.820
didn't you?

08:31.289 --> 08:32.589
We didn't find anything.

08:33.390 --> 08:36.789
Technology has advanced\Nover seven years.

08:36.789 --> 08:39.259
You have to search again.\NYou'll find something.

08:39.530 --> 08:41.460
Do you think\Nthat's possible...

08:41.460 --> 08:42.559
without a warrant?

08:42.999 --> 08:44.269
We found nothing\Nseven years ago...

08:44.269 --> 08:45.499
even after\Na thorough search.

08:45.499 --> 08:47.300
People made a fuss\Nand complained.

08:48.769 --> 08:50.940
It's not hard at all.

08:51.310 --> 08:53.710
Gi Yong Seob is locked up\Nright now.

08:54.139 --> 08:55.879
He's arrested\Nfor domestic violence.

08:56.349 --> 08:58.379
This can be the scene\Nof the crime.

08:59.310 --> 09:00.479
We need to search\Nthis place.

09:03.019 --> 09:06.759
I'll ask Mr. Hwang\Nto run the fingerprints.

09:13.160 --> 09:14.800
Mr. Hwang.

09:15.460 --> 09:16.530
Who are you?

09:16.999 --> 09:18.229
It's me.

09:19.570 --> 09:20.700
You're one of\Nthe people...

09:20.700 --> 09:21.900
who stole my polyribosome.

09:21.900 --> 09:24.310
You're Yoo Seol Ok, the\Nadministrative assistant.

09:25.139 --> 09:26.339
Don't come\Nto the forensics lab...

09:26.339 --> 09:27.379
for a while.

09:27.580 --> 09:29.040
I'm saying this\Nfor your sake.

09:29.440 --> 09:31.050
Constable Shin came\Na while ago...

09:31.050 --> 09:32.450
and got crashed.

09:45.430 --> 09:46.430
This.

09:46.830 --> 09:49.099
You were interviewed\Nfor "Science Times".

09:49.229 --> 09:50.700
I was so glad to see it...

09:50.700 --> 09:52.200
that I bought it\Nas soon as it came out.

09:52.570 --> 09:56.070
You look great\Nin the pictures.

09:57.040 --> 09:59.609
This came out earlier\Nthan expected.

10:00.379 --> 10:02.410
I'll come back later\Nif you're busy.

10:02.479 --> 10:03.509
Wait.

10:11.619 --> 10:12.820
(Restricted Area)

10:24.269 --> 10:26.700
So how did the picture\Ncome out?

10:26.700 --> 10:27.869
Mr. Hwang.

10:28.239 --> 10:29.810
Can you identify\Nthe bloodstain...

10:29.810 --> 10:31.009
from seven years ago?

10:31.440 --> 10:34.710
Don't tell me you're\Nasking me...

10:34.710 --> 10:37.080
to identify the case\Nfrom seven years ago.

10:39.780 --> 10:41.719
Identifying the bloodstain\Nfrom seven years ago...

10:41.719 --> 10:43.619
isn't as easy as you say.

10:43.619 --> 10:44.889
You have to ask...

10:44.889 --> 10:47.420
Mr. Oh for it since he's\Nthe expert in that field.

10:47.759 --> 10:49.930
Mr. Hwang isn't almighty,\Nyou see.

10:51.660 --> 10:53.560
So he isn't all-around.

10:53.560 --> 10:54.599
Hold on.

10:55.400 --> 10:57.400
There seems to be\Na misunderstanding.

10:57.830 --> 11:00.070
Because I'm outstanding\Nin other fields,

11:00.070 --> 11:01.739
it doesn't mean that\NMr. Oh's better than me...

11:01.739 --> 11:03.940
in terms of identifying\Nbloodstains.

11:23.830 --> 11:24.830
Mr. Woo.

11:25.530 --> 11:26.859
Are you okay?

11:26.859 --> 11:29.200
Gosh, what happened\Nto you?

11:29.400 --> 11:30.700
A car grazed him slightly.

11:31.129 --> 11:32.599
He'll be okay if he\Nputs a bandage...

11:32.599 --> 11:33.940
and applies an antiseptic\Non it for a few days.

11:34.400 --> 11:35.869
The doctor said\Nhe didn't need any crutch,

11:35.869 --> 11:37.469
but he insisted to use it.

11:38.269 --> 11:39.710
Are two weeks only\Na few days?

11:40.280 --> 11:41.609
Two weeks are enough\Nfor fender-benders.

11:42.540 --> 11:43.810
I'll help you.

11:43.810 --> 11:44.910
Do you need my help?

11:44.910 --> 11:46.320
He has his crutch,\Nso there's no need.

11:46.820 --> 11:47.879
He can walk by himself.

11:47.879 --> 11:48.879
No, thanks.

11:49.219 --> 11:50.650
I don't want to make\Na big deal out of it.

11:59.830 --> 12:00.830
Where's Seol Ok?

12:02.200 --> 12:04.570
She went somewhere\Nwith Mr. Gye a while ago.

12:04.900 --> 12:05.930
Mr. Gye?

12:07.200 --> 12:10.170
They've gotten very close\Nwith each other recently.

12:10.369 --> 12:12.239
Perhaps,\Nthey're going out.

12:12.239 --> 12:13.580
Don't be ridiculous.

12:14.509 --> 12:16.009
She went to the forensics\Na while ago.

12:16.550 --> 12:18.849
We're all here, so let's\Nstart our meeting.

12:19.450 --> 12:20.479
Lieutenant Ha.

12:22.219 --> 12:23.450
Where is he going?

12:23.450 --> 12:24.719
The forensic team.

12:29.290 --> 12:31.759
This isn't so bad.

12:33.129 --> 12:37.070
Shouldn't they have made\Nmy jawline sharper though?

12:37.599 --> 12:39.200
They couldn't express\Nthe feeling properly.

12:39.839 --> 12:40.839
What do you think?

12:42.969 --> 12:46.910
I feel bad that they\Nfailed in making...

12:47.339 --> 12:48.440
your sharp nose\Nstand out more.

12:49.710 --> 12:52.180
Kyung Mi,\Nyou're very sharp.

12:58.820 --> 12:59.989
You're here, Lady.

13:00.160 --> 13:01.290
I looked everywhere\Nfor you.

13:01.859 --> 13:03.229
I told you not to come\Naround this place.

13:03.989 --> 13:05.030
Hello, Lieutenant Ha.

13:05.930 --> 13:06.960
What's that?

13:06.960 --> 13:09.570
Haven't you read\Nthe magazine yet?

13:10.670 --> 13:13.200
Why would I read this\Nkind of magazine?

13:13.739 --> 13:15.499
They edited your face\Ntoo much here.

13:15.839 --> 13:17.410
Is this a photo\Nor a painting?

13:18.810 --> 13:20.879
It's a photo.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.950
It's a photo!

13:27.550 --> 13:28.749
Leave him alone.

13:29.989 --> 13:31.550
I guess you've got skills.

13:31.920 --> 13:33.290
How did you persuade\NMr. Hwang?

13:33.359 --> 13:34.920
It was Kyung Mi, not me.

13:35.290 --> 13:37.960
She can adjust to\Nany kind of situation.

13:39.060 --> 13:40.060
You're sharp.

13:40.900 --> 13:43.170
Kyung Mi!

13:43.170 --> 13:44.269
Yes!

13:45.030 --> 13:46.070
Let's go.

13:48.269 --> 13:51.009
Let's go find the body.

13:51.109 --> 13:52.310
You're so fearless.

13:52.810 --> 13:54.139
Aren't you afraid\Nof finding the body?

13:54.139 --> 13:56.780
I'm afraid that we might\Nnot be able to find it.

13:57.249 --> 13:58.509
We need to\Nfind it quickly...

13:58.509 --> 14:00.580
and resolve their\Nresentment if there's any.

14:19.200 --> 14:20.339
- Hi, Kyung Mi.\N- Hi.

14:20.739 --> 14:21.739
Hi.

14:23.210 --> 14:24.940
You're aware\Nthat luminol emits...

14:24.940 --> 14:28.339
a blue fluorescent color\Nin the dark, right?

14:29.810 --> 14:30.810
All right.

14:42.889 --> 14:44.229
I don't see any.

14:44.960 --> 14:47.129
There seems to be nothing.

14:49.300 --> 14:50.400
Isn't it a good thing?

14:50.700 --> 14:52.070
There's another room\Ninside.

15:03.180 --> 15:04.249
- What?\N- What?

15:12.920 --> 15:15.560
Unfortunately, a tragedy\Nhappened in here.

15:16.160 --> 15:18.660
It usually takes\Nabout a week...

15:18.660 --> 15:21.129
for the forensic team to\Nfind the identity of it.

15:21.900 --> 15:22.900
However,

15:23.269 --> 15:25.129
I've already finished\Nidentifying it...

15:25.129 --> 15:26.599
as I'm the genius\Nscientific investigator.

15:26.599 --> 15:27.639
Already?

15:27.639 --> 15:30.210
There was no need\Nfor any DNA test.

15:30.469 --> 15:31.469
Why?

15:31.940 --> 15:33.009
Tell us, Kyung Mi.

15:33.180 --> 15:34.180
Yes.

15:35.139 --> 15:36.580
Its blood type\Ndidn't match.

15:36.580 --> 15:38.410
Jang Myung Hoon's\Nblood type is A.

15:38.410 --> 15:41.780
But the blood types here\Nwere all found to be O.

15:41.780 --> 15:42.780
Hold on.

15:43.420 --> 15:45.019
Lee Yeong Sook's\Nblood type is O too.

15:45.219 --> 15:47.019
Is it impossible to\Nidentify the bloodstain...

15:47.019 --> 15:48.690
from seven years ago\Nas we expected?

15:49.259 --> 15:50.359
Nonsense!

15:50.389 --> 15:51.759
Even though it's\Nfrom seven years ago,

15:51.759 --> 15:53.830
even the latent bloodstain\Ncan be identified...

15:53.830 --> 15:55.530
with my latest method\Nthat I came up with.

15:55.530 --> 15:56.670
However, all the\Nbloodstains found here,

15:56.670 --> 15:57.800
which are blood type O,

15:57.800 --> 15:59.769
were in a fresh condition.

16:00.099 --> 16:01.269
In conclusion,

16:01.570 --> 16:04.310
there isn't any bloodstain\Nfrom seven years ago.

16:04.710 --> 16:05.710
Not...

16:06.139 --> 16:07.139
at all.

16:11.849 --> 16:12.849
What?

16:13.920 --> 16:14.979
This is strange.

16:18.320 --> 16:21.290
The cement here\Nis in a different color.

16:26.999 --> 16:29.999
The cement mix can't be\Nthe same all the time.

16:30.499 --> 16:32.200
Maybe they didn't cement\Nthe wall at the same time.

16:32.530 --> 16:34.369
This was cemented later.

16:35.540 --> 16:38.609
Kyung Mi, bring me\Nthe metal detector.

17:35.960 --> 17:37.029
Where are you going?

17:38.999 --> 17:41.069
My wife confessed\Neverything...

17:41.539 --> 17:44.340
that I never used violence\Nagainst her. Satisfied?

17:44.340 --> 17:45.569
Didn't you threaten\Nher again?

17:48.039 --> 17:50.579
You're under arrest for\Nmurdering Jang Myung Hoon.

17:51.210 --> 17:52.380
We found the bloodstained\Nknife and clothes...

17:52.380 --> 17:54.049
in the human\Nresources office.

17:55.479 --> 17:57.450
You don't seem\Nso surprised.

17:58.289 --> 17:59.920
No secret can\Nbe kept forever.

18:00.289 --> 18:01.319
Let's go.

18:12.900 --> 18:13.900
Why did you kill him?

18:15.200 --> 18:16.200
Detective.

18:17.170 --> 18:18.640
It's really not me.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.180
There's evidence.

18:20.180 --> 18:22.210
Until when do you think\Nyou can play innocent?

18:22.210 --> 18:24.210
It's true\Nthat I beat him up,

18:24.210 --> 18:25.680
but I didn't kill him.

18:25.680 --> 18:27.279
What about the knife\Nand clothes then?

18:27.479 --> 18:29.319
It seemed to\Nbe his luggage,

18:29.519 --> 18:31.150
so I didn't even touch it.

18:36.190 --> 18:37.729
Did he run away\Nfrom his house?

18:37.890 --> 18:39.860
Why did he put\Nthis huge luggage here?

18:42.299 --> 18:44.170
You buried him.

18:45.999 --> 18:48.370
I went to the restaurant\Nwhere my wife works,

18:49.400 --> 18:51.640
and I heard that\Na detective came by,

18:51.840 --> 18:53.640
saying Jang Myung Hoon\Nwent missing,

18:53.809 --> 18:55.380
but it was suspected\Nto be a murder case.

19:02.650 --> 19:04.150
A lot of people...

19:04.620 --> 19:06.319
saw me beat him up.

19:07.690 --> 19:09.660
I did it because I didn't\Nwant to be suspected.

19:10.130 --> 19:11.590
I'm an ex-convict,

19:12.029 --> 19:14.729
so I thought no one\Nwould believe me.

19:46.130 --> 19:48.999
All right, the culprit\Nhas been caught.

19:49.569 --> 19:52.170
Stop texting me now, okay,\NMs. Yoo Seol Ok?

19:52.870 --> 19:55.269
Stop visiting my unit too.

19:55.670 --> 19:57.110
Please stop now.\NI beg you.

20:14.360 --> 20:15.489
That's weird.

20:18.190 --> 20:20.360
What's weird?

20:20.960 --> 20:21.960
I don't think...

20:23.100 --> 20:24.969
this guy is the culprit.

20:35.739 --> 20:37.180
If Gi Yong Seob\Nis the culprit,

20:37.180 --> 20:39.180
then where's the body?

20:40.680 --> 20:41.779
It's really weird.

20:42.519 --> 20:44.190
Why did he bury\Njust the evidence?

20:44.590 --> 20:46.920
Gi Yong Seob probably\Nisn't the culprit.

20:47.219 --> 20:49.930
Are you saying that\Nsomeone's framing him?

20:52.160 --> 20:53.360
I'm not sure.

20:53.999 --> 20:56.430
So is Gi Yong Seob\Nthe culprit or not?

20:57.999 --> 20:59.299
I need something sweet.

20:59.870 --> 21:01.239
You want to\Ngo to Genoise again?

21:01.239 --> 21:02.640
I need sugar.

21:03.239 --> 21:06.410
Can't you just think\Nwith some cheap candies?

21:09.410 --> 21:11.150
It's nine dollars\Nper piece.

21:24.860 --> 21:25.890
Are we good now?

21:32.229 --> 21:34.200
Aren't you going to\Ntake your phone?

21:35.499 --> 21:36.670
Throw it away.

21:37.910 --> 21:39.739
It might be dangerous\Nfor me.

21:47.850 --> 21:49.049
Where are you?

21:49.549 --> 21:52.019
What can you give me\Nif I tell you?

21:53.420 --> 21:54.890
I do need something.

22:13.479 --> 22:14.640
Genoise?

22:14.979 --> 22:17.910
Does anyone hold\Na grudge against you?

22:17.979 --> 22:19.719
All I ever do\Nis making cake...

22:19.719 --> 22:21.420
and running this business.

22:21.420 --> 22:22.950
I don't know anything\Nother than those.

22:23.890 --> 22:26.150
I've never fought\Nwith anyone before.

22:27.960 --> 22:30.960
You're Secretary Kim?

22:34.860 --> 22:36.729
More vanilla sugar.

22:40.940 --> 22:41.999
That's good.

22:42.100 --> 22:43.269
Let's add some butter.

22:52.009 --> 22:53.180
Do you have\Nsomething to say?

22:54.620 --> 22:57.489
A few days ago,

22:58.049 --> 23:00.289
a detective came\Nto our third store.

23:02.090 --> 23:03.729
- A detective?\N- You know,

23:03.729 --> 23:05.130
that detective\Nand that lady...

23:05.130 --> 23:06.499
who come\Nto our store often.

23:07.559 --> 23:08.559
Why did they come?

23:09.259 --> 23:11.370
They asked me\Nabout a ring.

23:12.940 --> 23:16.100
At first, I didn't\Nreally remember,

23:16.340 --> 23:18.069
but I thought about\Nit later...

23:18.509 --> 23:20.140
and realized I wasn't\Nthe one...

23:20.140 --> 23:21.710
who put the ring\Nin the cake.

23:22.340 --> 23:23.479
What do you mean?

23:24.410 --> 23:28.549
Do you not remember\Nthat ring?

23:29.219 --> 23:31.989
You put that ring\Nin the cake yourself.

23:38.960 --> 23:40.100
Ms. Jung.

23:40.729 --> 23:42.600
Do you not remember?

23:51.309 --> 23:52.670
Can you put...

23:53.739 --> 23:55.239
a ring in the cake?

23:58.650 --> 24:01.519
- Sure. I'll bring it.\N- Okay.

24:29.779 --> 24:31.950
- Is that a takeout?\N- No.

24:31.950 --> 24:34.019
He wants me to\Nput the ring in here.

24:34.079 --> 24:35.719
I think he's proposing\Nto her.

24:36.549 --> 24:39.789
But they're both so drunk.

24:42.190 --> 24:44.690
Let's not ruin the cake.\NI'll put it in.

24:44.789 --> 24:45.829
Okay.

25:08.779 --> 25:11.549
I think we're almost done.\NShould I close the store?

25:11.819 --> 25:12.850
Sure.

25:25.569 --> 25:26.600
Take this.

25:33.380 --> 25:35.579
It's not even my payday.

25:35.809 --> 25:37.479
You've worked so hard.

25:37.680 --> 25:39.079
But you don't have to\Ncome in anymore.

25:39.880 --> 25:40.920
Pardon?

25:48.019 --> 25:51.360
I never imagined Secretary\NKim to be a woman.

25:52.829 --> 25:55.799
Or is it a man\Npretending to be a woman?

26:04.539 --> 26:06.539
This is Inspector Woo of\NJoongjin Police Station.

26:06.979 --> 26:09.210
Send me all background\Ninformation you have...

26:09.210 --> 26:11.680
on Jung Hee Yeon,\Nwho runs cake shops.

26:12.579 --> 26:13.719
Yes, okay.

26:32.700 --> 26:33.769
Ms. Jung.

26:34.900 --> 26:37.509
Ms. Yoo. Welcome.

26:43.009 --> 26:46.719
Is the lady you work with\Nat the third store?

26:46.749 --> 26:48.749
No, I fired her.

26:49.019 --> 26:50.090
Why?

26:50.150 --> 26:52.249
You didn't seem\Nto like her very much.

26:52.519 --> 26:54.190
You seemed to be\Nconcerned about her.

26:57.130 --> 26:58.329
I'm joking.

26:58.690 --> 27:00.160
I thought she could\Nbe on her own,

27:00.160 --> 27:02.229
so she's in charge\Nof our new place.

27:02.460 --> 27:03.469
Anyway,

27:03.769 --> 27:05.269
do you need\Nto talk to her?

27:05.430 --> 27:06.440
No.

27:07.200 --> 27:08.539
Where's Detective Ha?

27:09.100 --> 27:10.809
You always come with him.

27:11.440 --> 27:12.769
We came together.

27:18.979 --> 27:20.350
What are you doing\Nout there?

27:24.150 --> 27:25.489
He must like...

27:26.360 --> 27:28.059
watching plays.

27:28.489 --> 27:30.630
It's because\Nthat play is special.

27:31.259 --> 27:32.559
It's special?

27:34.430 --> 27:37.029
He always watches that\Nwhenever it's on.

27:37.529 --> 27:39.029
He goes there alone.

27:41.870 --> 27:42.940
Alone?

27:46.140 --> 27:48.680
Have you ever\Nseen that play?

27:49.039 --> 27:50.950
It feels like I'm\Nreading someone's diary,

27:51.150 --> 27:52.680
so I don't want to see it.

27:53.920 --> 27:57.920
It's a story of someone\Nconfessing love to a room.

28:00.989 --> 28:02.789
Jun, who's leaving,

28:02.989 --> 28:05.130
is filling the room\Nwith words of love.

28:05.660 --> 28:07.430
Only my shell\Nwill walk out of here.

28:08.430 --> 28:09.999
I'm leaving\Nmy real self in here.

28:11.069 --> 28:14.400
I'll make sure I say this\Nto not make you lonely.

28:15.870 --> 28:17.009
I love you.

28:18.870 --> 28:19.910
I love you.

28:20.340 --> 28:21.840
He wants to be there...

28:22.809 --> 28:25.279
like the air next to\Nhis lover's loneliness.

28:26.819 --> 28:28.279
Jun leaves the room...

28:28.279 --> 28:30.190
and lives the rest of\Nher life without love.

28:31.090 --> 28:34.620
The room filled with love\Nwaits for its master.

28:35.920 --> 28:37.890
That's why it's called\N"Waiting Room".

28:38.860 --> 28:40.900
Have you seen it?

28:41.329 --> 28:42.329
Yes.

28:42.930 --> 28:45.870
It was really sad,\Nso I cried a lot.

28:49.640 --> 28:52.910
It's a warm day, a great\Nday for perverts to roam.

28:53.640 --> 28:55.739
- Take this.\N- What is it?

28:55.739 --> 28:57.049
I picked it up\Noff of a street.

28:57.410 --> 28:59.180
Don't give me trash.\NThis is awful.

28:59.180 --> 29:02.749
I'm going to report you\Nfor stealing. That's why.

29:03.890 --> 29:05.049
Are you coming with me?

29:05.749 --> 29:06.819
No, thanks.

29:07.259 --> 29:08.559
You've never watched it.

29:09.729 --> 29:10.860
I don't want to.

29:26.809 --> 29:27.940
Jung Hee Yeon is...

29:28.579 --> 29:31.180
the public trust director\Nof Ha and Jung Law Firm?

29:34.019 --> 29:35.319
Okay, I got it.

29:59.710 --> 30:02.140
Secretary Kim meets\NHa and Jung Law Firm.

30:03.110 --> 30:06.210
Why did Ha and Jung\Ndrag a lobbyist...

30:06.210 --> 30:08.249
like Secretary Kim into\Nits public foundation?

30:11.650 --> 30:13.660
There must be\Nsomething going on.

30:16.059 --> 30:17.130
Come in.

30:22.529 --> 30:23.600
Hello.

30:24.370 --> 30:25.569
A room\Nwithout decorations.

30:25.569 --> 30:27.569
Well-thumbed books.

30:27.569 --> 30:29.840
Furniture arranged only\Nfor its functionality.

30:30.569 --> 30:32.440
There are too many photos,\Nwhich don't suit him.

30:32.809 --> 30:35.380
They're all about Dongban.

30:35.479 --> 30:36.479
Please sit down.

30:43.150 --> 30:46.719
Wan Seung told me\Nyou work together.

30:46.719 --> 30:48.920
He told me\Na lot about you too.

30:50.860 --> 30:53.029
Black shoes. White socks.

30:53.029 --> 30:55.460
He's not into fashion, and\Nhe just wears anything.

30:55.700 --> 30:58.729
That shirt was\Na gift from someone.

30:59.799 --> 31:01.670
That was also a gift.

31:02.269 --> 31:03.640
He wears it with care.

31:03.640 --> 31:05.309
A famous person\Nlike you...

31:05.309 --> 31:07.509
supporting my foundation\Nwill be...

31:07.509 --> 31:09.710
a huge help for us.

31:10.749 --> 31:11.950
He's polite.

31:11.950 --> 31:14.249
But the way he talks\Nis perfunctory.

31:14.249 --> 31:15.680
He's a typical elite.

31:17.049 --> 31:18.590
Ms. Jung Hee Yeon...

31:18.590 --> 31:20.190
is the chief director\Nof the foundation.

31:21.489 --> 31:23.059
Do you know Hee Yeon?

31:23.259 --> 31:24.559
He called her\Nby her first name.

31:25.059 --> 31:26.430
Do they know each other\Npersonally?

31:27.499 --> 31:30.100
I've met her before\Nbriefly.

31:30.370 --> 31:32.870
But I want to know\Nhow you know her.

31:33.039 --> 31:36.200
She's not\Nin a legal profession.

31:36.969 --> 31:38.210
I met her\Nwhen I was a judge...

31:38.210 --> 31:39.979
while doing\Nvolunteer work.

31:40.640 --> 31:41.940
He likes her.

31:42.340 --> 31:44.850
He dragged Secretary Kim\Nin for personal reasons.

31:51.219 --> 31:53.890
The president of Ha\Nand Jung, Ha Ji Seung.

31:56.229 --> 31:57.690
Secretary Kim is after...

31:58.190 --> 31:59.489
Ha and Jung Law Firm.

32:00.360 --> 32:03.670
A naive judge\Nand a model student.

32:04.799 --> 32:07.140
Probably it wasn't hard\Nto seduce him.

32:09.170 --> 32:12.370
Look into Inspector Woo of\NJoongjin Police Station.

32:12.710 --> 32:15.640
His reason for joining\NDongban is suspicious.

32:17.850 --> 32:19.110
Please look into it.

32:28.120 --> 32:29.219
Jenne.

32:30.690 --> 32:32.590
I'll leave you\Nin this room.

32:33.799 --> 32:35.630
You won't be lonely\Nthough.

32:37.799 --> 32:39.799
When you lie on this bed\Nalone,

32:40.969 --> 32:42.840
I'll always\Nlie next to you.

32:44.370 --> 32:46.170
Only my shell\Nwill walk out of here.

32:47.410 --> 32:49.140
I'm leaving\Nmy real self in here.

32:51.350 --> 32:53.319
I'll make sure\NI say this...

32:55.350 --> 32:57.120
to not make you lonely.

32:59.319 --> 33:00.390
I love you.

33:02.590 --> 33:03.630
I love you.

33:06.229 --> 33:07.299
I love you.

33:24.150 --> 33:26.380
You two were together.

33:36.489 --> 33:38.430
I'll stay and see...

33:38.430 --> 33:40.660
It's okay.\NI'm here for him.

33:40.660 --> 33:42.259
You must be busy.\NYou can leave.

34:01.779 --> 34:04.049
This wasn't in the plan.

34:12.829 --> 34:15.429
Kyung Mi.\NOctopus is in season.

34:15.498 --> 34:17.070
So I made something\Nwith it.

34:18.268 --> 34:20.268
I told you to leave...

34:20.268 --> 34:22.199
the octopus alone.

34:22.199 --> 34:24.570
I'm really confident\Nthis time.

34:26.840 --> 34:28.940
Okay. It's just octopus.

34:28.940 --> 34:30.150
If it's too salty,\NI'll wash it and eat it.

34:30.150 --> 34:31.550
If it's too bland,\NI'll add soy sauce.

34:35.018 --> 34:36.719
Where's the octopus?

34:37.119 --> 34:38.150
Ta-da.

34:38.650 --> 34:41.289
I made octopus pudding.

34:41.460 --> 34:43.389
You didn't expect this,\Nright?

34:47.360 --> 34:49.498
Try it.\NIt'll be delicious.

34:50.498 --> 34:51.630
Octopus pudding?

34:51.630 --> 34:54.840
It was so hard to put\Nthe octopus in the jelly.

34:55.268 --> 34:57.639
Kyung Mi. Try it.

34:57.769 --> 34:59.309
- Put it away.\N- Try it.

34:59.309 --> 35:00.880
- Put it away!\N- Taste it.

35:00.880 --> 35:01.979
- No.\N- Come on.

35:02.949 --> 35:05.309
Goodness. You're mean.

35:12.590 --> 35:13.590
There it is.

35:28.940 --> 35:30.170
That's it.

35:36.479 --> 35:38.710
- Hey.\N- You're here.

35:38.710 --> 35:40.479
Do you want to be\Narrested or something?

35:40.479 --> 35:41.650
Are you a cop\Nor something?

35:41.650 --> 35:43.449
That's why I came here\Nwith you.

35:53.159 --> 35:54.159
We're...

35:54.229 --> 35:57.130
having dinner\Nwith my fiance.

35:57.470 --> 35:58.769
We'll wait outside.

36:00.639 --> 36:01.740
Come in.

36:06.579 --> 36:08.110
I have guests.

36:08.110 --> 36:09.479
Can you go\Nbuy some drinks?

36:09.479 --> 36:10.479
Okay.

36:18.349 --> 36:19.519
Haven't you...

36:20.619 --> 36:22.659
found my dad yet?

36:24.360 --> 36:25.659
I think we have.

36:26.599 --> 36:28.059
Where is he?

36:29.699 --> 36:30.999
You should know.

36:32.070 --> 36:33.099
Me?

36:34.539 --> 36:37.010
I don't know\Nwhat you're saying.

36:37.269 --> 36:38.639
You knew about\Nthe relationship...

36:39.210 --> 36:41.909
he had with\NLee Yeong Sook. right?

36:42.979 --> 36:46.210
Mr. Jang didn't leave\Nthe house that day.

36:46.979 --> 36:48.519
So he is...

36:48.949 --> 36:50.090
in here.

36:50.090 --> 36:51.519
So where?

36:51.519 --> 36:52.550
Inside this house.

36:54.090 --> 36:55.090
On that day,

36:56.119 --> 36:58.729
everything happened\Nfrom here.

37:07.070 --> 37:10.470
Are you saying we did\Nsomething to my dad?

37:10.840 --> 37:12.409
I asked you to find him.

37:12.409 --> 37:14.679
I didn't ask you\Nto blame us.

37:14.979 --> 37:16.139
My husband...

37:17.449 --> 37:18.909
will come back.

37:18.909 --> 37:20.979
The murder went unnoticed.

37:21.349 --> 37:24.190
But you couldn't move\Nthe corpse.

37:24.190 --> 37:26.420
That's why you found it\Ndifficult...

37:26.760 --> 37:27.990
to move or go out.

37:28.289 --> 37:29.760
When your husband\Nwent missing,

37:29.760 --> 37:32.030
why didn't you call\Nyour daughter right away?

37:32.289 --> 37:34.960
Se Yeon\Nis your only child.

37:34.960 --> 37:36.059
You weren't home...

37:36.059 --> 37:37.470
when Mr. Jang\Nwent missing, were you?

37:38.030 --> 37:39.699
You stayed\Nin your residence, right?

37:40.970 --> 37:43.039
As far as I know,\Nyour mom was home alone.

37:44.670 --> 37:47.309
Your mom must've\Nneeded a few days.

37:47.610 --> 37:48.809
Do you have proof?

37:48.940 --> 37:50.249
You already know...

37:50.579 --> 37:53.380
that the proof is in here.

38:06.699 --> 38:08.800
What's in here?

38:12.829 --> 38:15.740
Mr. Jang is here.

38:16.369 --> 38:18.740
Where we're all standing.

38:20.280 --> 38:22.340
I don't see anything.

38:24.650 --> 38:25.809
(Auto Thermostat)

38:28.150 --> 38:29.380
I'll show you now.

38:33.090 --> 38:35.789
- Kyung Mi.\N- Kyung Mi. In here.

38:38.630 --> 38:40.829
What are you doing\Nin my house?

38:42.329 --> 38:46.170
This measures\Nthe floor density.

38:46.499 --> 38:48.800
If you dug up a hole...

38:48.800 --> 38:50.809
and buried something,

38:50.809 --> 38:53.039
then the density\Nwill be different.

38:53.039 --> 38:55.479
So that means\Nwe're detecting...

38:55.780 --> 38:58.179
the traces of\Na corpse being buried.

38:58.179 --> 38:59.179
That's right.

39:00.119 --> 39:03.019
Kyung Mi. I was\Nstanding around here.

39:03.019 --> 39:04.019
Okay.

39:09.360 --> 39:10.360
Mom.

39:10.829 --> 39:11.990
They're wrong, right?

39:13.059 --> 39:14.159
Se Yeon.

39:15.030 --> 39:16.369
Don't trust them.

39:16.369 --> 39:18.599
You can't move or go out.

39:18.829 --> 39:21.970
Will you live\Nwith his corpse forever?

39:21.999 --> 39:23.409
Nonsense.

39:23.769 --> 39:25.010
Everyone, get out!

39:30.550 --> 39:33.749
Seol Ok.\NI'm getting a signal.

39:55.539 --> 39:56.570
"Graduated in 2002..."

39:56.570 --> 39:58.409
"from Lyon Baking School\Nin France."

39:58.409 --> 40:00.010
"In 2003, she had\Na car accident..."

40:00.010 --> 40:01.579
"and lost consciousness."

40:02.240 --> 40:03.749
"She woke up\Nmiraculously."

40:03.949 --> 40:06.650
"From 2003 to 2017,"

40:06.920 --> 40:08.550
"she had\N13 plastic surgeries."

40:11.119 --> 40:13.090
13 plastic surgeries?

40:14.389 --> 40:16.119
Hello.

40:16.119 --> 40:18.530
I'm Inspector Woo of\NJoongjin Police Station.

40:18.889 --> 40:21.360
I asked to see you...

40:21.360 --> 40:23.329
because I wanted to ask\Nyou a few questions.

40:23.869 --> 40:26.440
You went to the baking\Nschool in France...

40:26.440 --> 40:29.769
with Jung Hee Yeon,\Nis that right?

40:29.769 --> 40:30.840
Yes,

40:30.840 --> 40:32.909
until she had\Na car accident,

40:32.909 --> 40:34.079
we were roommates.

40:35.679 --> 40:39.179
Have you never met her\Never since then?

40:39.510 --> 40:41.749
We see each other from\Ntime to time even today.

40:41.849 --> 40:43.490
I see.

40:44.449 --> 40:47.920
Didn't you feel\Nany change in her...

40:47.920 --> 40:49.659
after studying\Nabroad in France?

40:51.130 --> 40:53.460
It felt unfamiliar\Nwhen we first met...

40:53.760 --> 40:55.130
after she was discharged\Nfrom the hospital.

40:55.659 --> 40:57.699
It was because she did\Na lot of surgeries.

40:57.900 --> 41:01.099
How is her\Nusual personality?

41:01.499 --> 41:03.010
It must be because she\Ngrew up in a rich family,

41:03.010 --> 41:05.440
but she's bright,\Npleasant, and positive.

41:06.380 --> 41:09.010
She's always the same.

41:10.010 --> 41:11.650
She doesn't change.

41:12.150 --> 41:15.749
Did something\Nhappen to her?

41:16.289 --> 41:17.590
Something might've\Nhappened to her...

41:19.150 --> 41:21.019
a long time ago.

41:39.409 --> 41:40.880
How did you know\Nshe buried the body...

41:40.880 --> 41:41.909
under the floor?

41:43.179 --> 41:45.650
She was an amateur\Nto cement the floor.

41:46.749 --> 41:49.849
She made it obvious by\Ncementing it unevenly...

41:50.289 --> 41:52.449
unlike the other parts\Nof the floor.

42:00.699 --> 42:01.699
Also, it bothered me...

42:01.760 --> 42:04.329
that they were using the\Nelectric heating panels.

42:04.869 --> 42:06.170
The hose is installed...

42:06.170 --> 42:08.840
under the thick cement for\Nnormal heating systems.

42:08.970 --> 42:10.909
But these electric\Nheating panels are thin...

42:10.909 --> 42:12.809
and don't need much space.

42:13.110 --> 42:14.280
It must've been good...

42:14.280 --> 42:15.440
for securing space\Nto bury the body.

42:15.539 --> 42:19.110
She didn't call\NJang Se Yeon right away...

42:19.110 --> 42:21.050
Because she needed\Naround 3 to 4 days...

42:21.519 --> 42:22.749
for the cement to get dry.

42:48.079 --> 42:49.309
Mom...

42:52.079 --> 42:54.349
How could you kill my dad?

42:57.690 --> 42:58.789
Mom.

42:59.720 --> 43:03.159
How did you eat\Nand sleep in the house?

43:05.090 --> 43:06.429
It's not true, right?

43:08.499 --> 43:12.099
Tell me it's not true.\NTell me it's not true!

43:12.269 --> 43:13.539
Why did you do it?

43:16.840 --> 43:18.610
He said he'd leave.

43:20.110 --> 43:21.110
How...

43:22.780 --> 43:24.749
How dare he abandon\Nhis family?

43:28.920 --> 43:29.920
Hold on.

43:30.690 --> 43:33.420
Let me go. I need to go.

43:33.559 --> 43:35.019
- I need to go.\N- Don't go!

43:35.019 --> 43:37.490
Please. I beg you.\NI need to go!

43:37.789 --> 43:38.990
- Please let me go.\N- No.

43:39.260 --> 43:42.229
Let me just go!

43:49.170 --> 43:50.309
Honey!

44:51.729 --> 44:53.400
(Yongmyung\NHuman Resources Office)

44:53.400 --> 44:55.539
How dare he\Nabandon his family?

44:56.070 --> 44:58.240
How dare he\Nabandon his family?

44:58.970 --> 45:01.579
How... How...

45:02.710 --> 45:04.349
How could he do it?

45:20.130 --> 45:22.760
(Testimony Record)

45:23.429 --> 45:25.400
I thought it was\Nbetter than...

45:25.670 --> 45:27.269
sending him\Nto another woman.

45:28.869 --> 45:29.940
Still,

45:30.240 --> 45:31.840
wouldn't it have been\Nbetter that he was alive?

45:32.309 --> 45:33.710
Even if you wouldn't be\Nable to see him again.

45:36.650 --> 45:37.679
Detective,

45:38.809 --> 45:40.820
have you ever\Nwaited for someone...

45:41.320 --> 45:42.780
all day long in your room?

45:44.650 --> 45:47.090
How could you wait\Nfor her...

45:47.490 --> 45:48.659
for 17 years?

45:49.929 --> 45:52.590
I can never\Nunderstand you.

45:53.929 --> 45:55.530
I had no choice...

45:57.670 --> 45:59.269
because I couldn't\Nhelp it.

46:02.369 --> 46:04.710
Every Sunday was\Na torture for me.

46:05.840 --> 46:06.880
Look.

46:13.420 --> 46:14.420
When my husband...

46:15.780 --> 46:18.889
borrowed a book\Non Saturday, I thought...

46:20.119 --> 46:22.059
that Sunday would\Ncome again.

46:23.729 --> 46:25.760
I thought that Sunday\Nwould come forever.

46:27.460 --> 46:28.829
Until the day I died,

46:30.530 --> 46:32.570
it was going\Nto torture me.

46:38.869 --> 46:39.909
("Smile for Myself")

46:52.050 --> 46:55.360
I wondered how I'd live if\Nhe left with that woman.

46:56.990 --> 46:58.059
I'd wait...

46:58.590 --> 47:00.800
for the door to open\Nfor my entire life.

47:04.470 --> 47:05.970
I thought it was better...

47:06.699 --> 47:09.670
to be with him that way\Nthan to wait for him.

47:13.179 --> 47:14.809
I did it because\NI loved him.

47:16.309 --> 47:18.409
Love can't give you\Nan excuse for everything.

47:19.249 --> 47:20.949
You killed someone\Nout of love,

47:21.249 --> 47:22.650
so it's pointless.

47:23.849 --> 47:25.720
No one would want to\Ntake that love of yours.

47:26.760 --> 47:29.090
I might have to live the\Nrest of my life in jail.

47:30.030 --> 47:31.360
It doesn't matter.

47:32.690 --> 47:35.059
That room was like\Nprison for me anyway.

47:36.929 --> 47:37.999
But...

47:40.099 --> 47:41.599
Se Yeon,

47:45.970 --> 47:47.139
my daughter...

48:05.329 --> 48:07.460
Why did she take\Nsuch a choice?

48:09.030 --> 48:10.769
Because she\Nwas crazy in love.

48:13.300 --> 48:14.539
That's...

48:15.400 --> 48:17.210
how love is.

48:21.979 --> 48:23.050
Goodness.

48:23.610 --> 48:24.849
It would've been great...

48:25.050 --> 48:27.650
if each of them lived\Nhappily in separate ways.

48:28.780 --> 48:29.949
Could it\Nhave been possible?

48:30.449 --> 48:31.490
The other's happiness...

48:31.490 --> 48:32.519
must've meant\Nher unhappiness.

48:33.260 --> 48:36.119
Then again, you aren't\Nso normal either.

48:36.559 --> 48:39.059
You waited for one woman\Nfor 17 years.

48:39.530 --> 48:41.699
Oh, right.\NThanks for the play.

48:42.229 --> 48:44.829
You watch that play called\N"Waiting Room" every year.

48:44.829 --> 48:47.099
A room is just a room,\Nso what's there to wait?

48:47.199 --> 48:49.300
Rooms consist of cement,\Nsteel bars,

48:49.300 --> 48:51.369
and proper insulation.\NThose are all about them.

48:51.369 --> 48:53.039
Oh, right. Wallpaper too.

48:53.039 --> 48:56.039
You're so simple-minded.\NI'm envy you.

48:56.039 --> 48:58.050
I just need to love\Nsomeone in front of me.

48:58.050 --> 48:59.479
There's no need\Nto complicate things.

49:01.150 --> 49:02.220
Then...

49:04.090 --> 49:06.320
who is in front of you\Nright now?

49:19.300 --> 49:22.170
Oh, Detective.\NDid you solve the case?

49:22.170 --> 49:24.070
- I haven't.\N- I'll help you. Come.

49:25.070 --> 49:27.240
- I've thought about it,\N- Yes.

49:27.710 --> 49:30.550
and the culprit must be\Nthe victim's acquaintance.

49:30.550 --> 49:32.809
- Really?\N- They must be around.

49:33.780 --> 49:36.179
The motive for\Nthe crime...

49:36.179 --> 49:37.619
Ms. Yoo Seol Ok!

49:42.320 --> 49:44.889
You're not cleaning the\Nstation as you're told.

49:44.889 --> 49:47.860
Now, you're meddling\Nin their investigation?

49:49.499 --> 49:50.670
Darn it.

49:50.699 --> 49:52.570
You punks are detectives,

49:52.570 --> 49:54.400
but you're getting help\Nfrom this lady.

49:54.400 --> 49:56.909
Getting help from her\Nor not isn't important.

49:56.909 --> 49:59.240
I want to go ask\Na shaman if I can.

50:00.179 --> 50:01.679
I'm done cleaning.

50:01.679 --> 50:05.210
Goodness, you are\Na smooth talker.

50:05.210 --> 50:06.749
How can you\Nclean up the place...

50:06.749 --> 50:08.679
if you are nosing around\Nlike this...

50:14.690 --> 50:18.760
They offered to\Nclean up their own space.

50:18.760 --> 50:20.630
I couldn't stop them.

50:23.630 --> 50:24.829
Look at you all.

50:25.099 --> 50:28.139
You never clean up\Nyour own space.

50:28.499 --> 50:31.340
What will happen\Nwith mine?

50:32.170 --> 50:34.210
Go make some coffee\Nfor the meeting.

50:34.440 --> 50:35.440
For 50 people?

50:35.940 --> 50:37.150
Yes, sir.

50:37.510 --> 50:39.409
I have to go make coffee.

50:40.320 --> 50:42.849
About that case.\NIt looks like murder,

50:42.849 --> 50:44.650
- but it's not.\N- Hey, guys. Wait.

50:45.349 --> 50:46.360
Hey.

50:46.490 --> 50:48.059
- Then?\N- It's an accident.

50:48.460 --> 50:49.990
It's a characteristic\Nof accidental deaths.

50:49.990 --> 50:51.059
Let us do it.

50:52.289 --> 50:55.460
The body was found\Nto be strangled, right?

50:55.729 --> 50:57.599
It's like a snail\Ncoiling itself.

50:58.369 --> 50:59.840
It was death\Nby suffocation.

51:00.039 --> 51:03.440
You can also see\Nblood congestion...

51:03.440 --> 51:05.170
on their face and neck.

51:05.170 --> 51:06.170
Yes.

51:07.710 --> 51:11.679
(Violent Crimes Unit 2)

51:11.679 --> 51:12.679
What?

51:28.229 --> 51:30.470
Have you snooped around...

51:30.470 --> 51:32.530
to find information\Nabout that pervert?

51:33.070 --> 51:35.940
I've been too busy\Ncatching a murderer...

51:35.940 --> 51:37.170
of a thought-to-be\Nmissing case.

51:37.809 --> 51:40.840
Forget it. It's my job to\Ngo out and catch killers.

51:41.380 --> 51:42.380
I heard about...

51:42.380 --> 51:44.679
the missing case\Nfrom seven years ago...

51:44.949 --> 51:46.349
through Mr. Gye\Nof Unit One.

51:47.220 --> 51:48.220
Really?

51:48.749 --> 51:50.749
Then I won't\Nhave to report to you.

51:50.749 --> 51:52.119
Is it normal for me...

51:52.119 --> 51:54.720
to hear about our case\Nfrom Unit One?

51:55.590 --> 51:57.329
Why are you\Nmaking this so hard?

51:57.329 --> 51:58.729
You can just tell me...

51:58.729 --> 51:59.900
to report back to you\Nfrom now on.

51:59.900 --> 52:01.030
Then from now on,

52:01.800 --> 52:03.070
report back to me often.

52:04.070 --> 52:05.829
But I need you\Nto be here...

52:05.829 --> 52:07.940
to be able\Nto report to you.

52:08.170 --> 52:10.309
Why are you going around\Nwith your crutch?

52:11.210 --> 52:12.369
You seem fine now.

52:12.740 --> 52:15.380
Things can still go wrong.\NIt's quite dangerous.

52:15.780 --> 52:17.849
Inspector Woo.\NLieutenant Ha.

52:19.179 --> 52:22.119
What's happening with\Nthat trench coat pervert?

52:22.119 --> 52:24.889
We've been getting\Nso many reports...

52:24.889 --> 52:27.920
that he's been seen\Nwithin our jurisdiction.

52:28.260 --> 52:31.530
This unit has caught\Nzero criminals.

52:32.389 --> 52:33.530
I'm going out now.

52:34.030 --> 52:36.599
I'll arrest everyone who's\Nwearing a trench coat.

52:38.800 --> 52:40.440
He'll get him soon.

52:40.440 --> 52:43.309
He's such\Na competent detective.

52:47.579 --> 52:49.079
Look at them.

52:52.280 --> 52:54.079
- You both saw him?\N- Yes.

52:54.079 --> 52:55.479
In that alley.

52:55.479 --> 52:58.150
He suddenly took off\Nhis pants. It was scary.

52:58.519 --> 53:00.090
- It was really sudden.\N- Yes.

53:00.090 --> 53:02.289
- When was this?\N- A week ago.

53:02.960 --> 53:06.229
He's about this tall.

53:06.229 --> 53:08.900
He looked like\Na normal guy.

53:08.900 --> 53:11.670
There wasn't much\Nto see anyway.

53:11.670 --> 53:13.699
He had no pants on.

53:14.340 --> 53:15.769
I guess he's not cold.

53:16.740 --> 53:18.510
Do you remember\Nwhat I said?

53:18.510 --> 53:20.139
If you see\Nsomeone suspicious,

53:20.440 --> 53:22.079
you have to run\Nno matter what.

53:22.079 --> 53:23.809
Or call me right away.

53:23.809 --> 53:24.809
Okay?

53:25.449 --> 53:26.650
That's Detective Ha.

53:27.150 --> 53:28.150
Detective Ha.

53:28.920 --> 53:29.920
Goodness.

53:30.789 --> 53:31.990
Hey, Corporal Gong.

53:33.289 --> 53:35.490
Hey, you must be Ah Ram.

53:35.720 --> 53:37.090
Hello.

53:37.090 --> 53:38.530
You recognize her\Nright away.

53:38.530 --> 53:40.360
Come on, I'm a detective.

53:40.559 --> 53:41.800
Are you dropping her off?

53:41.800 --> 53:43.199
Yes, I don't feel easy\Nabout this.

53:43.199 --> 53:45.130
I'll be right back\Nafter I drop her off.

53:45.499 --> 53:48.999
These kids aren't scared\Nof perverts. I'm worried.

53:48.999 --> 53:51.240
Yes, come back quickly.\NLet's go eat with him.

53:51.240 --> 53:53.139
Eat? How can you eat?

53:53.139 --> 53:55.179
This pervert is roaming\Nabout our neighborhood.

53:56.249 --> 53:57.579
You have to ask...

53:57.579 --> 53:59.579
even the kids about\Nthe details, okay?

53:59.979 --> 54:01.619
- Okay?\N- Yes, sir.

54:04.119 --> 54:05.119
Goodbye.

54:06.460 --> 54:09.190
He's only been studying\Nto get promoted.

54:09.929 --> 54:11.429
That's the thing\Nabout having a daughter.

54:11.860 --> 54:13.329
Where will I find him?

54:13.329 --> 54:15.199
He shows up so randomly.

54:15.199 --> 54:17.929
Guys, where can I\Ngo to find him?

54:18.199 --> 54:19.269
- Where?\N- I don't know.

54:19.800 --> 54:23.039
Have you worked\Nwith Ms. Jung before?

54:23.340 --> 54:24.340
Yes.

54:24.470 --> 54:26.210
I helped her with\Nrunning the shop...

54:26.210 --> 54:28.110
and learned\Nhow to make cake.

54:29.280 --> 54:31.749
Then why did you quit?

54:32.949 --> 54:34.579
I don't really know.

54:35.979 --> 54:36.990
Take this.

54:37.789 --> 54:38.789
What?

54:41.690 --> 54:44.090
It's not even my payday.

54:44.090 --> 54:45.729
You've worked so hard.

54:45.960 --> 54:47.260
But you don't have to\Ncome in anymore.

54:48.059 --> 54:49.630
She's always been...

54:49.630 --> 54:51.400
nothing but nice\Nwhen we worked together.

54:51.670 --> 54:53.940
She was nice?

54:53.940 --> 54:54.940
Yes.

54:55.240 --> 54:58.070
What was she like\Non the outside?

54:58.940 --> 55:00.440
Ms. Jung...

55:00.679 --> 55:02.409
was all about making cake.

55:02.949 --> 55:06.150
She overworked herself\Nto the point of obsession.

55:06.619 --> 55:09.849
She's a pretty well-known\Npatissier in the industry.

55:09.849 --> 55:12.389
She is.\NHer cake is perfect.

55:13.690 --> 55:16.090
Oh, but...

55:16.329 --> 55:18.159
It's okay.\NYou can tell me.

55:18.690 --> 55:20.530
Something weird happened.

55:21.460 --> 55:23.269
I saw a cake...

55:23.269 --> 55:26.699
that was exactly like hers\Nwhen I went to Japan.

55:26.699 --> 55:28.340
I tried it because\Nit was uncanny,

55:28.340 --> 55:29.570
and its taste,\Nshape, size,

55:29.570 --> 55:31.309
and even ingredients\Nwere the same.

55:31.440 --> 55:33.139
It was even scary.

55:33.309 --> 55:34.309
A copy?

55:34.909 --> 55:37.380
Yes. It was like a copy.

55:54.360 --> 55:55.360

56:16.150 --> 56:19.659
how others perceive you is\Ndifferent from real you.

56:19.920 --> 56:20.920
Pardon?

56:21.389 --> 56:22.960
The fourth Genoise.

56:25.889 --> 56:28.860
How come there's no\Nfirst Genoise?

57:41.170 --> 57:42.240
I got it.

58:13.400 --> 58:14.800
I'm sure you'll like it.

58:16.170 --> 58:18.570
This cake is made\Nespecially for you.

58:19.740 --> 58:21.979
It must've been tough\Nto do this every day.

58:21.979 --> 58:23.210
You should get some rest.

58:23.210 --> 58:24.210
But...

58:24.610 --> 58:26.449
the tickets are\Nalready sold.

58:26.449 --> 58:28.150

58:58.809 --> 59:02.019
I will lie down there\Nnext to you.

59:08.789 --> 59:10.329

59:48.929 --> 59:51.670
my voice will whisper\Ninto your ears.

59:58.110 --> 59:59.309
I will lock up...

01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:16.340
There was a fancy\Nbouquet on the stage.

01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:17.970
The second Seo Hyun Soo.

01:03:18.610 --> 01:03:19.740
Don't come near.

01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:21.110
Is it the Mi Joo we know?

01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:23.349
She isn't dead, is she?

01:03:24.210 --> 01:03:25.309
Mi Joo.

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:27.119
I'll make sure\Nto catch the culprit.

01:03:27.249 --> 01:03:28.249
President Ha.

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:30.519
I thought you stopped\Nkeeping in touch.
