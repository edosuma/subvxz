22:59.116 --> 23:01.902

good manager, baby.

23:01.945 --> 23:04.121
See here, Ms. Astra here

23:04.165 --> 23:07.255

for a proper manager.

23:07.298 --> 23:10.171

I say it is, understood?

24:00.526 --> 24:02.092

24:02.136 --> 24:06.662
- In front of your boyfriend,
you just disappeared.

24:06.706 --> 24:08.577

a little rough sometimes,

24:08.621 --> 24:10.710

his preferences.
