And when I'm not on duty, I'll
report directly back to this cell.

I have a few months to live.

And in that time, I will
lead the people to salvation.

I had no idea she was
planning anything of the kind.

12:17.120 --> 12:19.621
He's hitting
the bottle. A lot.

12:22.583 --> 12:24.960
Thank you for the company,

You okay, baby?

12:41.644 --> 12:42.853
No, I'm not okay.
My head feels like

12:42.937 --> 12:45.063
it's gonna
roll off my shoulders.

12:45.148 --> 12:46.523
What're you working on?

12:46.607 --> 12:49.943
I'm trying to figure out how
to solve our re-supply problem

12:50.027 --> 12:53.071
now that half the fleet
has gone out on strike.

12:53.156 --> 12:54.156
Are you serious?

12:54.240 --> 12:55.574
Yes, I'm serious.

12:55.658 --> 12:56.742
I should
probably call a summit.

12:56.826 --> 12:58.660
Sit down with all
the ship captains

12:58.745 --> 13:00.287
and explain the situation
and tell them

13:00.371 --> 13:02.831
why I had to
declare martial law.

13:03.374 --> 13:06.168
Screw them. Like you have
to explain yourself to them.

13:06.252 --> 13:09.296
It wouldn't hurt. Might
cool things down a little.

13:12.759 --> 13:14.009
What?

13:14.844 --> 13:16.303
Nothing.

you how to do your job.

I know that's
one of your issues.

13:24.520 --> 13:26.104

13:26.189 --> 13:29.816

feels kind of touchy-feely.

feel about martial law. "

13:34.363 --> 13:36.323

what you gotta do,

calls you, "Madam President".

still not cooperating.

refusing the re-supply order.

pretty thin on manpower.

enough Marine non-coms

18:45.508 --> 18:47.342

many boarding parties.

18:47.468 --> 18:49.552

18:49.678 --> 18:51.763
to command the boarding
parties if you have to.

18:51.847 --> 18:54.557

and bring back the supplies.

20:14.096 --> 20:15.513
Were they armed?

20:15.598 --> 20:17.432
No, sir, but

20:17.516 --> 20:20.185
you had to be there. They were
yelling and screaming at us

20:20.269 --> 20:23.521
and then it got violent. They
started throwing things, canisters,

20:25.065 --> 20:26.191
coffee, I think.

20:26.275 --> 20:27.358
Coffee?

20:27.651 --> 20:30.153
You shot people
for throwing coffee?

38:18.972 --> 38:20.180
Thanks.

38:31.192 --> 38:33.527
Thanks, Doc.
I appreciate it.

38:33.861 --> 38:36.863
Don't thank me.
Thank her.

38:36.948 --> 38:39.491
TYROL: Why? What did
she have to do with it?

38:39.993 --> 38:41.201
BALTAR: Everything.

38:41.577 --> 38:43.203
Nothing.

38:48.293 --> 38:53.255
Love is a strange
and wonderful thing, Chief.

38:55.049 --> 38:58.135
You'd be happy you
experienced it at all.

38:58.511 --> 39:01.138
Even if it was
with a machine.

39:02.390 --> 39:03.849
TYROL: What're they
going to do to her?

39:03.933 --> 39:06.435
They're setting up
a new holding facility.

39:06.602 --> 39:10.522
There will be tests,
mental, physical.

39:10.773 --> 39:13.900
Like she's... Like she's
some kind of lab rat?

39:16.154 --> 39:17.821
That's the idea.

39:20.908 --> 39:23.035
This is just great.

39:23.369 --> 39:27.205
Bill Adama's little baby boy
pulls the wool over your eyes

39:27.290 --> 39:29.416
and you let him
get away scot free.

39:29.500 --> 39:31.543
You're a laughingstock.

39:31.711 --> 39:34.004
You didn't want
this command.

39:34.130 --> 39:36.840
Well, don't worry about it. You
won't have it for much longer.

39:36.924 --> 39:40.677
All because when push came
to shove, you got shoved.

39:40.762 --> 39:42.346
It was his son.

39:42.430 --> 39:44.056
ADAMA: Saul.

39:51.272 --> 39:54.024
What's happening on my ship?

39:57.779 --> 40:00.280
Wait in the corridor.

40:00.365 --> 40:03.408
Ellen, can I speak
to my XO?

40:03.618 --> 40:05.118
Of course.

40:12.668 --> 40:13.960
(GRUNTING) Slow.

40:14.045 --> 40:15.629
(PANTING)

40:19.008 --> 40:21.134
What's happened?

40:22.220 --> 40:24.846
I've frakked
things up and good.

40:25.473 --> 40:26.431
How?

40:26.516 --> 40:28.100
I made some bad calls.

40:28.476 --> 40:29.601
(CHUCKLES)

40:29.685 --> 40:30.727
I've done that.

40:30.812 --> 40:32.312
Not like these.

40:33.189 --> 40:35.232
You gonna pour us
one of those or what?

40:35.316 --> 40:36.441
Yeah.

40:39.278 --> 40:41.071
I never had
much use for people

40:41.155 --> 40:43.365
who second-guessed
my decisions,

40:45.284 --> 40:48.036
especially if they've
never held a command.

40:48.162 --> 40:50.372
They don't
understand the pressure.

40:52.083 --> 40:54.334
You make a call

40:54.961 --> 40:57.671
that affects
the lives of thousands

40:58.089 --> 41:00.882
and you have no one
to turn to for backup.

41:00.967 --> 41:03.051
TIGH: You make it look easy.

41:03.511 --> 41:05.637
You know that's a lie now.

41:08.766 --> 41:10.934
A lot of pieces to pick up.

41:12.019 --> 41:13.728
Then we'll pick
them up together.

41:13.855 --> 41:15.605
Where's my son?

41:18.484 --> 41:19.776
MAN: Bitch!

41:19.902 --> 41:21.194
WOMAN: Traitor!

41:21.362 --> 41:22.946
(PEOPLE YELLING)

41:38.087 --> 41:39.171
(GUN FIRES)

42:04.197 --> 42:05.405
(MURMURING)

42:06.240 --> 42:09.075
No, no, no, no.

42:14.457 --> 42:15.499
(GASPING)

42:15.583 --> 42:17.334
I love you, Chief.
