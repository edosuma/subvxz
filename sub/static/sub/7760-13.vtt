FOUR, FIVE, SIX *

00:13.147 --> 00:14.115

00:40.174 --> 00:45.613
[distant wailing of sirens]

01:07.635 --> 01:11.739
- FUCKER DIDN'T SHOW UP.
[scoffs]

01:11.772 --> 01:15.343
- I KNOW.

01:15.376 --> 01:17.745
WE CAN GO BACK AGAIN
TOMORROW NIGHT.

01:17.778 --> 01:20.348
I'LL DRESS UP LIKE A HUSTLER,
WE CAN TRY AGAIN.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.722
- [snorts]

01:28.756 --> 01:33.261
YOU LOOKED HOT.

01:57.685 --> 02:01.522
[both chuckling]

02:01.555 --> 02:05.226
- THIS IS GOING
TO COST YOU $100.

02:05.259 --> 02:07.795
- WE WERE JUST PRETENDING,
REMEMBER?

02:07.828 --> 02:09.563
- MAYBE YOU WERE.

02:09.597 --> 02:11.532
[knocking at door]

02:27.281 --> 02:30.651
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

02:30.684 --> 02:31.919
BESIDES THAT.

02:31.952 --> 02:34.322
- I BROUGHT YOU THIS.

02:34.355 --> 02:36.290
- THAT'S VERY THOUGHTFUL OF YOU.
DID YOU MAKE IT YOURSELF?

02:36.324 --> 02:41.262
- IT'S THE COP'S.

02:41.295 --> 02:42.263
- YOU FUCKED THE COP?

02:42.296 --> 02:43.564
- YOU SAID YOU NEEDED DNA.

02:43.597 --> 02:45.666
- A CIGARETTE BUTT
WOULD HAVE SUFFICED.

02:45.699 --> 02:48.302
- HE DOESN'T SMOKE.

02:48.336 --> 02:54.308
I TOLD YOU I'D DO ANYTHING.

02:54.342 --> 02:56.710
- I GOT TO HAND IT
TO YOU, KID.

02:56.744 --> 02:58.279
YOU GOT A LOT OF...

02:58.312 --> 03:00.414
SPUNK.

03:00.448 --> 03:01.849
- HOLY SHIT.

03:01.882 --> 03:03.317
IT'S LIKE THE MOVIES.

03:03.351 --> 03:04.985
- I DON'T RECALL
A SCENE LIKE THIS

03:05.018 --> 03:07.688
IN ANY FILM NOMINATED
FOR BEST PICTURE.

03:07.721 --> 03:10.558
- I ALSO FOUND OUT HIS NAME.

03:10.591 --> 03:12.326
- KENNETH REICHERT.

03:12.360 --> 03:15.296
- I LIFTED IT FROM THE GARBAGE
WHEN HE WASN'T LOOKING.

03:15.329 --> 03:18.432
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW,
THEY CANCELLED GAY AS BLAZES.

03:18.466 --> 03:20.868
- SO HOW ABOUT EXPRESSING
YOUR APPRECIATION?

03:20.901 --> 03:23.337
- OOH, HE ALREADY HAS,
THREE TIMES WITH ME.

03:23.371 --> 03:25.005
- WHAT DO YOU BOTHER
WITH THAT FOR?

03:25.038 --> 03:26.974
HOW MUCH IS HE CHARGING YOU?
- $100?

03:27.007 --> 03:28.776
- MM.
HE REFUSES TO PAY, THOUGH.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.010
- I DON'T BLAME HIM.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.012
I WOULDN'T GIVE YOU
TEN BUCKS.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.848
- OKAY, I THINK IT'S TIME
SOMEONE WAS TUCKED INTO BED.

03:34.882 --> 03:38.319
MM-HMM.
AND NOT MINE.

03:38.352 --> 03:40.020
- YOU FUCKED A MURDERER?

03:40.053 --> 03:42.890
- WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
I USED A CONDOM.

03:42.923 --> 03:44.458
- WELL, YOUR SAFE-SEX LECTURE
PAID OFF.

03:44.492 --> 03:45.893
- SHUT THE FUCK UP!

03:45.926 --> 03:47.361
- LET'S TRY TO STAY CALM.

03:47.395 --> 03:48.729
- YEAH,
THE PROFESSOR'S RIGHT.

03:48.762 --> 03:50.030
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT?

03:50.063 --> 03:51.865
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO PUT HIM UP TO THIS.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.501
- HE DIDN'T PUT ME UP TO SHIT.
I WAS TRYING TO HELP.

03:53.534 --> 03:55.336
- YOU WERE TRYING
TO IMPRESS BRIAN.

03:55.369 --> 03:57.037
- YEAH, WELL,
HE WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST ONE.

03:57.070 --> 04:00.308
- WELL, HE ALREADY
HAS A BOYFRIEND.

04:00.341 --> 04:01.742
- YOU DO?

04:01.775 --> 04:03.511
- IN A NON-DEFINED,
NON-CONVENTIONAL WAY, YEAH.

04:03.544 --> 04:04.912
- LET'S NOT LOSE FOCUS HERE.

04:04.945 --> 04:06.013
YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND
THAT WHAT YOU DID

04:06.046 --> 04:07.481
WAS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.

04:07.515 --> 04:08.516
- THIS GUY COULD'VE
KILLED YOU.

04:08.549 --> 04:10.017
- THEY ALL COULD.

04:10.050 --> 04:11.385
- WELL, IF YOU KNOW THAT,
THEN WHY DO YOU DO IT?

04:11.419 --> 04:12.753
- I HAVE LOW SELF-ESTEEM.

04:12.786 --> 04:15.356
I WAS SEXUALIZED
AT TOO EARLY AN AGE.

04:15.389 --> 04:16.424
IT'S EXCITING, FUN,
AND A GREAT WAY

04:16.457 --> 04:18.025
TO MAKE
NON-REPORTABLE INCOME.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.693
- I WOULD LIKE AN HONEST ANSWER,
SMART-ASS.

04:19.727 --> 04:20.928
- HE JUST GAVE YOU ONE.

04:20.961 --> 04:21.929
- WELL, WE'RE NOT
GOING TO LET YOU

04:21.962 --> 04:23.364
THROW YOUR LIFE AWAY.

04:23.397 --> 04:24.765
YOU ARE GOING
TO STOP HUSTLING.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.500
YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF--

04:26.534 --> 04:28.802
- RESPECT THE CURFEW,
NOT SLEEP TILL NOON.

04:28.836 --> 04:30.404
- GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

04:30.438 --> 04:32.440
- THINK ABOUT YOUR FUTURE.
- CHRIST!

04:32.473 --> 04:34.708
- I'D RATHER GET KILLED
AND TOSSED IN A DUMPSTER

04:34.742 --> 04:35.909
THAN LISTEN
TO THE TWO OF YOU.

04:35.943 --> 04:38.011
FUCK!

04:52.560 --> 04:57.465
- NICE GOING,
MA AND PA.

04:57.498 --> 05:02.470
- [grunting]

05:02.503 --> 05:04.405
- TED?

05:04.438 --> 05:05.473
TEDDY.

05:05.506 --> 05:06.807
TEDDY, TEDDY, TEDDY.

05:06.840 --> 05:07.808
- I'M NOT DONE YET.

05:07.841 --> 05:09.109
- I KNOW, I KNOW, BUT WE--

05:09.142 --> 05:10.110
WE'VE BEEN GOING AT IT
FOR HOURS,

05:10.143 --> 05:13.013
BABY, AND I, UH--

05:13.046 --> 05:15.082
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D HEAR MYSELF SAY THIS,

05:15.115 --> 05:17.084
BUT I THINK I NEED A REST.

05:17.117 --> 05:18.686
- WELL, HERE.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.354
TAKE SOME MORE.

05:20.388 --> 05:22.890
- NO, I-I DON'T, UH,
I DON'T WANT ANY MORE,

05:22.923 --> 05:24.825
AND I-I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD EITHER.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.827
- [snorting]

05:26.860 --> 05:28.762
COME ON, EM.

05:28.796 --> 05:31.031
- NO, I-I SAID
I DON'T WANT TO.

05:31.064 --> 05:34.368
- BUT WASN'T IT AMAZING?

05:34.402 --> 05:35.969
- IT WAS AMAZING,
ALL RIGHT.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.038
- MM, LIKE SOMEONE
TURNED ON THE POWER

05:38.071 --> 05:41.041
AND IT WENT SURGING
THROUGH EVERY...

05:41.074 --> 05:42.109
MM, WHAT?

05:42.142 --> 05:46.046
[chuckles]

05:46.079 --> 05:47.981
- EVERY NERVE?
EVERY MUSCLE?

05:48.015 --> 05:49.450
- OH, YEAH.

05:49.483 --> 05:52.119
YOU SEE HOW LUCID YOU ARE?

05:52.152 --> 05:53.654
THAT'S THE BEAUTY
OF CRYSTAL.

05:53.687 --> 05:57.057
IT MAKES EVERYTHING--
AH, CRYSTAL CLEAR.

05:57.090 --> 06:00.561
OH GOD.
OH, FEEL MY DICK.

06:00.594 --> 06:02.863
MY DICK IS SO HARD.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.465
LET'S FUCK.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.934
- PLEASE, TEDDY.
I JUST TOLD YOU, I--

06:06.967 --> 06:09.002
- YOU KNOW, BEING ABLE
TO SHARE THIS WITH YOU

06:09.036 --> 06:11.138
MEANS EVERYTHING TO ME.

06:11.171 --> 06:12.873
IT'S ALL I WANTED,

06:12.906 --> 06:15.843
FOR US TO DO THIS,
TOGETHER.

06:20.914 --> 06:23.016
- I'M GOING TO GO
TAKE A SHOWER,

06:23.050 --> 06:25.152
BRUSH MY TEETH,

06:25.185 --> 06:27.020
GET THIS AWFUL TASTE
OUT OF MY MOUTH.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.822
- WELL, WHAT THE FUCK
AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

06:28.856 --> 06:32.660
I WANT TO COME.

06:34.862 --> 06:36.930
[scoffs]
WELL, JERK ME OFF AT LEAST.

06:36.964 --> 06:40.501
YOU THINK
YOU CAN HANDLE THAT?

06:40.534 --> 06:43.704
- MAYBE LATER.
- NOT LATER, NOW.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.574
L-LATER.
OH, GOD.

06:46.607 --> 06:51.512
MM.

06:51.545 --> 06:53.881
[moaning]

07:01.221 --> 07:04.692
OH, YEAH.
OH, YEAH.

07:04.725 --> 07:09.563
THAT'S IT.
MM-HMM. MM.

07:09.597 --> 07:11.532
- I TOLD YOU ALREADY,
THERE WERE THREE OF US THERE.

07:11.565 --> 07:13.834
ME AND TWO OTHER GUYS.
ONE IS--

07:13.867 --> 07:17.538
- WHERE'S THE GODDAMN
BALLISTICS REPORT?

07:17.571 --> 07:19.973
WELL, SOMEBODY'D BETTER DO SOME
DETECTIVE WORK AND FIND IT.

07:20.007 --> 07:23.677
I HAVEN'T GOT ALL...
DAY.

07:23.711 --> 07:25.212
- YOUR EYES ARE TIRED.

07:25.245 --> 07:26.814
YOU'RE GETTING SLEEPY.

07:26.847 --> 07:28.816
- WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

07:28.849 --> 07:30.751
- UH, THIS NEWFANGLED
CONTRAPTION'S

07:30.784 --> 07:33.086
CALLED A CONDOM.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.688
YOU WANTED HARD EVIDENCE.

07:34.722 --> 07:35.989
IT DOESN'T GET MUCH HARDER.

07:36.023 --> 07:38.859
- CHRIST, DON'T TELL ME
YOU ACTUALLY--

07:38.892 --> 07:41.595
- NO, NOT ME,
OFFICER KRUPKE.

07:41.629 --> 07:42.963
THAT KID.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.231
THE ONE WHOSE WORD
YOU WOULDN'T TAKE.

07:44.264 --> 07:48.569
WELL, MAYBE
YOU'LL TAKE IT NOW.

07:48.602 --> 07:50.838
- WHAT THE HELL DO YOU EXPECT ME
TO DO WITH THIS?

07:50.871 --> 07:53.006
- UH, TEST IT,

07:53.040 --> 07:54.708
AND SEE IF
IT MATCHES THE LOAD

07:54.742 --> 07:58.111
THAT YOU SIPHONED
OUT OF DUMPSTER BOY'S ASS.

07:58.145 --> 08:04.117
- THIS SO-CALLED COP,
HAS HE GOT A NAME?

08:04.151 --> 08:06.787
KENNETH REICHERT.

08:06.820 --> 08:10.057
- RING A BELL?

08:10.090 --> 08:13.727
HELLO?

08:13.761 --> 08:14.862
- HE WAS AN OFFICER.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.196
- HE WAS?

08:16.229 --> 08:19.066
- HE RETIRED
ABOUT A YEAR AGO,

08:19.099 --> 08:20.801
SAID HE WAS
UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.536
- [chuckles]

08:22.570 --> 08:24.672
YEAH, WELL, I'M SURE
THAT MURDERING SOMEONE

08:24.705 --> 08:25.873
CAN BE VERY STRESSFUL.

08:25.906 --> 08:27.808
- YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.143
- DID HE KNOW STOCKWELL?

08:30.177 --> 08:32.145
- YOU COULD SAY SO.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.081
THEY WERE PARTNERS

08:34.114 --> 08:38.652
FOR 15 YEARS.

08:42.189 --> 08:45.759
- HAVING SEXUAL RELATIONS
WITH A PARTNER IN THE FIRM,

08:45.793 --> 08:49.229
USING AGENCY RESOURCES
TO PRODUCE SUBVERSIVE MATERIALS

08:49.262 --> 08:53.567
IN ORDER TO UNDERMINE
A VALUED CLIENT.

08:53.601 --> 08:57.104
MR. VANCE WAS LIVID.
LIVID.

08:57.137 --> 09:01.775
AND IF THIS IS TRUE,
I DON'T BLAME HIM.

09:01.809 --> 09:03.644
WELL?

09:03.677 --> 09:05.779
IS IT?

09:05.813 --> 09:08.115
- I SUPPOSE IT DEPENDS ON HOW
ONE PERCEIVES THE SITUATION.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.117
- AND, UH, HOW DO YOU
PERCEIVE IT?

09:10.150 --> 09:12.786
- MR. KINNEY AND I
HAD PERSONAL RELATIONS

09:12.820 --> 09:14.655
PRIOR TO MY INTERNSHIP
AT VANGUARD,

09:14.688 --> 09:16.790
SO IT'S NOT AS IF
I WAS FUCKING THE BOSS.

09:16.824 --> 09:18.859
AS FOR PRODUCING
SUBVERSIVE MATERIALS,

09:18.892 --> 09:21.929
I MADE SOME POSTERS
BASED ON MY POLITICAL BELIEFS.

09:21.962 --> 09:24.364
- I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN YOUR POLITICAL BELIEFS

09:24.397 --> 09:25.999
OR YOUR SEXUAL RELATIONS.

09:26.033 --> 09:28.135
I'M INTERESTED IN THE REPUTATION
OF THE SCHOOL.

09:28.168 --> 09:30.103
YOUR BEHAVIOR
HAS JEOPARDIZED

09:30.137 --> 09:32.139
THE ENTIRE
INTERNSHIP PROGRAM.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.808
- IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION,
I WAS DOING A KICK-ASS JOB.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.944
- YOU WILL THEREFORE APPEAR

09:36.977 --> 09:38.211
BEFORE THE DISCIPLINARY
COMMITTEE

09:38.245 --> 09:40.347
TO APOLOGIZE
FOR YOUR ACTIONS.

09:40.380 --> 09:42.349
- YOU WANT ME TO APOLOGIZE?

09:42.382 --> 09:46.019
- IF YOU CARE TO REMAIN
A STUDENT AT THIS INSTITUTE.

09:46.053 --> 09:50.891
- MR. GODDARD JUST CALLED.
HE SAID IT'S URGENT.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.860
- YEAH, THAT WAY.
YEAH.

09:52.893 --> 09:53.861
[clears throat]

09:53.894 --> 09:55.228
- OH.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.297
- HELLO IN THERE.
IT'S ME, MICHAEL...

09:57.330 --> 09:58.298
[both laughing]

09:58.331 --> 10:00.634
BUT YOU CAN CALL ME "DAD."

10:00.668 --> 10:02.302
- YOU THINK THIS THING
REALLY WORKS?

10:02.335 --> 10:04.772
- WELL, THE ARTICLE SAID THAT
PRENATAL LEARNING IS POSSIBLE.

10:04.805 --> 10:07.841
UM, VOICE RECOGNITION,
NAMES.

10:07.875 --> 10:09.309
- LINDS, SAY SOMETHING.
- YEAH.

10:09.342 --> 10:12.045
OH, OH, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

10:12.079 --> 10:13.647
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO RECITE
THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS,

10:13.681 --> 10:15.315
JUST SAY "HI."

10:15.348 --> 10:17.317
- HI.

10:17.350 --> 10:18.652
THIS IS YOUR OTHER MOM.

10:18.686 --> 10:22.189
- [chuckles]

10:22.222 --> 10:26.059
- OH, UM, AND THIS
IS YOUR CONCIERGE.

10:26.093 --> 10:28.128
I HOPE YOU'RE ENJOYING
YOUR STAY.

10:28.161 --> 10:30.898
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,
JUST HOLLER.

10:37.037 --> 10:39.139
- I'LL COME BACK LATER.
- WAIT, EM.

10:39.172 --> 10:42.142
YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING
TO THE BABY?

10:42.175 --> 10:44.344
- I'M DON'T THINK
HIS OR HER PARENTS

10:44.377 --> 10:47.214
WOULD LIKE HIM OR HER TO HEAR
WHAT I HAVE TO SAY.

10:47.247 --> 10:51.418
- LET'S GO.
- OKAY.

10:51.451 --> 10:53.020
- BYE, MICHAEL.
- BYE.

10:53.053 --> 10:54.888
- SEE YOU LATER.

10:54.922 --> 10:57.324
- BYE.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.035
- HOW LONG IS THIS
GOING TO GO ON FOR?

11:08.068 --> 11:10.303
- UNTIL THEY APOLOGIZE
TO TEDDY

11:10.337 --> 11:12.439
FOR NOT ACCEPTING
HIS APOLOGY.

11:12.472 --> 11:14.975
- WELL, WHAT ABOUT YOUR APOLOGY
FOR CALLING MELANIE A CUNT?

11:15.008 --> 11:16.476
- I'LL APOLOGIZE
FOR CALLING HER A CUNT

11:16.509 --> 11:18.211
WHEN SHE APOLOGIZES
FOR CALLING ME A SILLY FAGGOT.

11:18.245 --> 11:19.813
- THEY ARE YOUR FRIENDS,

11:19.847 --> 11:22.049
AND YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
THEY LOVE YOU AND TED.

11:22.082 --> 11:24.184
- THEN THEY COULD'VE SHOWN
SOME UNDERSTANDING.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.854
SO HE USED CRYSTAL.
OKAY?

11:26.887 --> 11:29.256
I MEAN, HE'S HARDLY
THE ONLY ONE.

11:29.289 --> 11:31.792
I'M SURE HALF THE PEOPLE
IN THIS COMMUNITY HAVE TRIED IT.

11:31.825 --> 11:33.193
- I HAVEN'T.

11:33.226 --> 11:34.327
- WELL, IF YOU HAD,
MAYBE YOU'D REALIZE

11:34.361 --> 11:37.397
IT'S NOT SUCH A BIG DEAL.

11:37.430 --> 11:42.202
- WHAT, ARE YOU SAYING...

11:42.235 --> 11:45.272
DON'T TELL ME.

11:45.305 --> 11:49.342
YOU DIDN'T.

11:49.376 --> 11:52.345
- IT JUST HAPPENED.

11:52.379 --> 11:56.216
- TAKING CRYSTAL
DOES NOT JUST HAPPEN.

11:56.249 --> 11:58.085
- I THOUGHT THAT IF
I DID IT WITH HIM,

11:58.118 --> 12:01.088
HE WOULD KNOW THAT
I'M NOT BEING JUDGMENTAL

12:01.121 --> 12:04.491
OR--OR DISAPPROVING,
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE, OKAY?

12:04.524 --> 12:05.492
THAT--THAT HE WOULD TRUST ME,

12:05.525 --> 12:07.294
AND KNOW THAT I LOVE HIM,

12:07.327 --> 12:10.430
SO THAT WHEN I ASKED HIM
TO STOP,

12:10.463 --> 12:12.365
HE WOULD.

12:12.399 --> 12:17.971
- AND DID HE SAY
HE WOULD STOP?

12:18.005 --> 12:21.241
- HE SAID THAT
HE NEVER FELT SO CLOSE

12:21.274 --> 12:24.444
TO ANYONE
IN HIS LIFE,

12:24.477 --> 12:29.049
AND THAT HE CAN'T WAIT FOR US
TO DO IT AGAIN.

12:36.824 --> 12:38.158
- THEY WANT ME TO APPEAR

12:38.191 --> 12:39.526
IN FRONT
OF THE DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE

12:39.559 --> 12:42.262
AND APOLOGIZE,
LIKE I DID SOMETHING WRONG.

12:42.295 --> 12:43.931
- WELL, DIDN'T YOU?

12:43.964 --> 12:45.332
- ARE YOU SAYING
YOU AGREE WITH THEM?

12:45.365 --> 12:47.134
- IF SOMEONE HAD TOLD ME
WHAT YOU WERE UP TO,

12:47.167 --> 12:49.069
I WOULD HAVE
FIRED YOUR ASS,

12:49.102 --> 12:51.004
IF I DIDN'T HAVE MY DICK
INSIDE IT.

12:51.038 --> 12:54.074
- BUT I'M NOT SORRY
FOR ANYTHING.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.475
- I'M NOT SAYING
YOU SHOULD BE SORRY.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.344
I'M JUST SAYING
YOU SHOULD APOLOGIZE.

12:57.377 --> 13:00.080
- JUST GIVE IN TO THEM?
ROLL OVER?

13:00.113 --> 13:02.149
- WELL, DO YOU WANT TO FINISH
YOUR EDUCATION AND GET A DEGREE?

13:02.182 --> 13:05.418
GET A GOOD JOB AND BE RICH?

13:05.452 --> 13:08.021
- I DON'T CARE ABOUT MONEY.
- OKAY.

13:08.055 --> 13:10.223
DO YOU WANT TO HAVE THE FREEDOM
TO CREATE WHATEVER YOU WANT

13:10.257 --> 13:11.224
WITHOUT HAVING TO ANSWER
TO ANYONE?

13:11.258 --> 13:12.492
- WHO DOESN'T?

13:12.525 --> 13:13.493
- WELL, THEN YOU CARE
ABOUT THE MONEY,

13:13.526 --> 13:16.363
SO YOU SHOULD GO APOLOGIZE.

13:16.396 --> 13:20.433
NOT FOR THEM.
FOR YOU.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.435
- WELL, DETECTIVE HORVATH.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.437
OUT OF ALL THE PLACES
IN GREATER PITTSBURGH,

13:24.471 --> 13:26.907
WHAT BRINGS YOU TO OUR HUMBLE
LITTLE ESTABLISHMENT?

13:26.940 --> 13:28.909
- I HAVE A DATE.

13:28.942 --> 13:31.912
- OH.
- AND HERE HE IS.

13:31.945 --> 13:33.246
- WHAT, DID YOU CONVERT HIM?

13:33.280 --> 13:35.515
- COFFEE, DEB, PLEASE.

13:35.548 --> 13:38.385
- YOU WERE RIGHT.

13:38.418 --> 13:39.519
- THOSE ARE
MY THREE FAVORITE WORDS,

13:39.552 --> 13:41.054
AFTER "9 INCHES, CUT."

13:41.088 --> 13:43.256
- ABOUT WHAT?

13:43.290 --> 13:45.592
- UM, THE CREAM.
- WHAT, DID IT TURN?

13:45.625 --> 13:48.929
- IT MATCHES THAT FOUND
IN JASON KEMP'S RECTUM.

13:48.962 --> 13:51.398
- FOR YOUR INFORMATION,
I JUST POURED IT.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.266
- I'M REFERRING
TO A SPERM SAMPLE

13:53.300 --> 13:54.868
FROM AN OFFICER
THIS KID, HUNTER,

13:54.902 --> 13:56.403
SAID HE SAW
WITH THE VICTIM.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.005
- HOLY SHIT.

13:58.038 --> 13:59.406
DOES THAT MEAN
HE'S THE KILLER?

13:59.439 --> 14:01.274
- IT MEANS HE HAD
ANAL INTERCOURSE WITH HIM

14:01.308 --> 14:02.475
ON THE NIGHT
HE WAS MURDERED.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.277
- IS IT ENOUGH
TO MAKE HIM A SUSPECT?

14:04.311 --> 14:06.146
- NOT NECESSARILY.
- WE HAD A DEAL.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.881
YOU SAID IF I BROUGHT YOU
HARD EVIDENCE,

14:07.915 --> 14:09.082
YOU'D RE-OPEN THE CASE.

14:09.116 --> 14:10.550
- I KNOW WHAT I SAID.

14:10.583 --> 14:12.352
- WELL, I UPHELD MY END,
AND SO DID HUNTER,

14:12.385 --> 14:14.221
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN.

14:14.254 --> 14:16.223
- SORRY, KINNEY.

14:16.256 --> 14:18.391
IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH.

14:27.667 --> 14:29.970
- STILL SEARCHING FOR THAT
EXQUISITE TURN OF PHRASE

14:30.003 --> 14:32.639
THAT IN FIVE WORDS OR LESS
EXPRESSES THE ESSENCE

14:32.672 --> 14:34.241
OF WHAT YOUR CHARACTER'S
FEELING?

14:34.274 --> 14:37.444
- I'M FRUSTRATED AS SHIT.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.446
- ONLY FOUR,
CONGRATULATIONS.

14:39.479 --> 14:42.015
NOW COME TO BED.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.389
IT MUST BE HARD TO CONCENTRATE
ON YOUR WRITING,

14:49.422 --> 14:51.124
OR ANYTHING ELSE,
FOR THAT MATTER,

14:51.158 --> 14:53.460
WHEN YOUR MIND
IS ON OTHER THINGS.

14:53.493 --> 14:54.461
- HMM?

14:54.494 --> 14:56.529
- CASE IN POINT.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.465
- SORRY, MICHAEL, IT'S JUST
THAT AFTER WHAT HE DID,

14:58.498 --> 15:00.267
IT'S OBVIOUS WE'RE NOT
GETTING THROUGH TO HIM.

15:00.300 --> 15:01.701
HE'S STILL HUSTLING.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.203
HE'S STILL COMING HOME
WHENEVER HE PLEASES.

15:03.236 --> 15:04.671
HE WON'T EVEN DISCUSS
THE POSSIBILITY

15:04.704 --> 15:06.539
OF GOING BACK TO SCHOOL.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.341
- WELL, AREN'T YOU THE ONE
WHO SAID THESE THINGS TAKE TIME?

15:08.375 --> 15:09.609
- IT CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS
INDEFINITELY.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.544
- WELL, WE'RE DOING
THE BEST WE CAN.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.613
- WELL, MAYBE OUR BEST
ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH.

15:13.646 --> 15:17.084
MAYBE HE'D BE BETTER OFF
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

15:17.117 --> 15:19.286
- THERE ISN'T ANYONE ELSE.
IT'S JUST US.

15:19.319 --> 15:22.555
- AND WE'RE IN OVER OUR HEADS,
THANKS TO ME,

15:22.589 --> 15:25.358
BECAUSE I HAD
TO SAVE THE WORLD.

15:25.392 --> 15:27.427
- NOT THE WORLD,
JUST ONE KID.

15:27.460 --> 15:31.364
- MICHAEL,
WE'RE NOT HELPING HIM.

15:31.398 --> 15:33.433
AND WHAT'S MORE,
HE DOESN'T WANT OUR HELP.

15:33.466 --> 15:39.039
SO I THINK WE SHOULD
JUST ADMIT OUR FAILURE...

15:39.072 --> 15:41.374
AND LET HIM GO.

15:41.408 --> 15:43.210
[faint chatter]

15:43.243 --> 15:45.512
- OH, THAT'S A LITTLE STEEP.
YOU AIN'T THAT CUTE.

15:45.545 --> 15:46.713
- COME ON.

15:46.746 --> 15:49.316
IT'S ONLY 100 BUCKS.

15:49.349 --> 15:51.651
YOU'LL HAVE A GOOD TIME.

15:51.684 --> 15:55.455
- [chuckles]

15:55.488 --> 15:57.124
- SO?
- MAYBE.

15:57.157 --> 15:59.192
- YOUR VERY BEST SCOTCH,
IN A CLEAN GLASS.

15:59.226 --> 16:03.330
- WELL, THINK ABOUT IT.

16:03.363 --> 16:05.398
- AND ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE?

16:05.432 --> 16:07.334
- I DON'T ACCEPT DRINKS
FROM STRANGERS.

16:07.367 --> 16:09.469
THAT MUST BE
THE FIRST TIME

16:09.502 --> 16:12.239
THOSE WORDS
HAVE BEEN SPOKEN IN HERE.

16:16.709 --> 16:19.079
- YOU'RE THE ASSHOLE
FROM THE OTHER NIGHT.

16:19.112 --> 16:23.683
- YOU HAVE A GOOD MEMORY.
I'M IMPRESSED.

16:23.716 --> 16:28.555
SAY, WHILE YOU'RE AT IT...

16:28.588 --> 16:32.425
YOU REMEMBER HIM?

16:39.732 --> 16:42.635
- CAN'T SAY I DO.

16:42.669 --> 16:45.638
- HE USED TO COME HERE.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.507
HE HAD A REALLY HOT ASS.

16:47.540 --> 16:50.177
- I WOULDN'T KNOW.

16:50.210 --> 16:54.514
- THAT'S STRANGE, 'CAUSE
THE COPS FOUND YOUR LOAD UP IT.

16:54.547 --> 16:56.716
HEY, WHERE'RE YOU GOING?

16:56.749 --> 16:58.418
YOUR DRINK JUST GOT HERE.

16:58.451 --> 16:59.586
- I DON'T KNOW
WHO THE HELL YOU ARE,

16:59.619 --> 17:01.388
OR WHAT THE FUCK
YOU'RE UP TO...

17:01.421 --> 17:04.657
- YEAH, HOW RUDE OF ME
NOT TO INTRODUCE MYSELF.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.726
BRIAN KINNEY,
CONCERNED CITIZEN.

17:06.759 --> 17:08.728
- BUT YOU'VE GOT
THE WRONG GUY.

17:08.761 --> 17:10.563
- FORGIVE ME,

17:10.597 --> 17:15.268
I THOUGHT THAT YOU
WERE KENNETH REICHERT,

17:15.302 --> 17:18.571
1737 VISTA COURT LANE.

17:20.840 --> 17:24.144
THAT KID YOU PICKED UP
OUT FRONT THE OTHER NIGHT?

17:24.177 --> 17:27.747
WHAT A RASCAL.

17:27.780 --> 17:32.619
HE ALSO SNATCHED
THE CONDOM YOU USED,

17:32.652 --> 17:35.755
AND GUESS WHAT?

17:35.788 --> 17:37.490
POLICE DID
A LITTLE SCIENCE PROJECT,

17:37.524 --> 17:39.692
AND, UH,
YOUR LITTLE SWIMMERS

17:39.726 --> 17:42.695
AND THE ONES THEY FOUND
IN DUMPSTER BOY'S ASS

17:42.729 --> 17:46.466
ARE MEMBERS
OF THE SAME TEAM.

17:53.406 --> 17:54.774
[glasses clink]

17:54.807 --> 17:57.644
BOTTOMS UP.

18:02.682 --> 18:06.853
SO, JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY,

18:06.886 --> 18:09.522
WHY'D YOU KILL HIM?

18:09.556 --> 18:12.459
WAS IT AN ACCIDENT?

18:12.492 --> 18:17.330
THINGS GET A LITTLE
OUT OF HAND?

18:17.364 --> 18:18.631
DID HE FIGURE OUT
YOU'RE A COP

18:18.665 --> 18:20.133
AND TRY AND BLACKMAIL YOU?

18:20.167 --> 18:23.670
I MEAN, THAT MUST BE
WHY YOU RESIGNED.

18:23.703 --> 18:27.540
WAS THAT YOUR IDEA,
OR STOCKWELL'S?

18:27.574 --> 18:30.477
- SHUT UP.

18:30.510 --> 18:32.145
- DID YOU GO TO HIM
AND CONFESS THE WHOLE THING?

18:32.179 --> 18:35.348
HE PROMISED TO PROTECT YOU
IF YOU QUIT THE FORCE?

18:35.382 --> 18:37.750
THAT'S REAL LOYALTY.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.352
ON THE OTHER HAND,
MAYBE HE FIGURED

18:39.386 --> 18:42.689
IF IT CAME OUT THAT
HIS FRIEND AND PARTNER

18:42.722 --> 18:44.891
IS A MURDERER AND A FAG,

18:44.924 --> 18:47.894
IT MIGHT KILL,
SO TO SPEAK,

18:47.927 --> 18:49.629
HIS CHANCE TO BE MAYOR.

18:49.662 --> 18:53.366
- I SAID SHUT UP!

18:53.400 --> 18:57.237
- I'M SURE IF YOU
WERE TO CONFESS,

18:57.270 --> 19:01.841
EVERYONE WOULD BE
MORE THAN SYMPATHETIC.

19:01.874 --> 19:06.279
AFTER ALL, YOU WANTED TO DO
THE RIGHT THING, RIGHT?

19:15.555 --> 19:16.789
- WE'LL WISH HIM LUCK,
AND SAY WE THINK

19:16.823 --> 19:18.791
THIS IS THE BEST THING
FOR ALL OF US.

19:18.825 --> 19:21.461
- I GUESS.

19:21.494 --> 19:25.532
- HEY.

19:25.565 --> 19:27.267
DID YOU WANT
SOME BREAKFAST?

19:27.300 --> 19:28.868
- I ALREADY ATE.

19:28.901 --> 19:31.538
- I DIDN'T SEE ANY DIRTY DISHES
IN THE SINK.

19:31.571 --> 19:33.740
- THAT'S BECAUSE
I WASHED THEM.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.675
- YOU ALSO WASHED YOUR HAIR.

19:35.708 --> 19:39.546
- YEAH.

19:39.579 --> 19:40.980
- WHAT'S THE OCCASION?

19:41.013 --> 19:44.551
- GOT A DATE
WITH A HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPAL.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.819
- I'M SURE THE KIDS' PARENTS
WOULD LOVE TO HEAR THAT.

19:46.853 --> 19:52.225
- I'M THINKING ABOUT
GOING BACK TO SCHOOL.

19:52.259 --> 19:53.960
- REALLY?

19:53.993 --> 19:56.896
[exhales incredulously]

19:56.929 --> 20:00.300
THAT IS, UH, YOU'RE NOT--
YOU'RE NOT JUST SAYING THAT?

20:00.333 --> 20:02.769
- THERE'S NO HARM
CHECKING IT OUT.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.937
- RIGHT.

20:13.346 --> 20:14.647
- THERE YOU ARE.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.483
- WHOO-HOO, WOULD YOU LOOK
AT THIS PLACE?

20:16.516 --> 20:18.518
DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS GOING
TO BE SO FANCY-SCHMANCY.

20:18.551 --> 20:19.686
[chuckles]

20:24.957 --> 20:27.327
[growls]

20:27.360 --> 20:28.528
- YEAH, I BROUGHT
A CLIENT HERE

20:28.561 --> 20:29.996
AND JUST FELL IN LOVE
WITH THE PLACE.

20:30.029 --> 20:31.931
THEY MAKE
A FENNEL PHYLLO PIE

20:31.964 --> 20:33.466
THAT IS TO DIE FOR.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.468
- MM.

20:35.502 --> 20:37.337
- SO, UM, WHAT DO YOU
WANT FOR LUNCH?

20:37.370 --> 20:39.606
- MM, NOTHING FOR ME.

20:39.639 --> 20:41.408
- YOU HAVE TO EAT.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.876
- I'LL JUST WATCH YOUR
FENNEL PHYLLO FEED FEST.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.413
[chuckles]

20:51.318 --> 20:53.553
- SO, UH, WHERE YOU BEEN?

20:53.586 --> 20:55.755
- VISITING A FRIEND.

20:55.788 --> 20:58.825
- MICHAEL? BRIAN?
- NO, MARK.

20:58.858 --> 21:01.761
- YOUNG DOCTOR CRYSTAL.
- [laughs]

21:01.794 --> 21:04.631
SO WE DO A LITTLE TINA.

21:04.664 --> 21:06.499
- SINCE WHEN ARE WE
ON A FIRST NAME BASIS

21:06.533 --> 21:08.368
WITH ILLEGAL SUBSTANCES?

21:08.401 --> 21:09.902
- YOU LOVED IT, TOO.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.838
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I-I DIDN'T LOVE IT.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.773
I ONLY DID IT
TO MAKE YOU HAPPY,

21:13.806 --> 21:16.843
AND I'M NEVER DOING IT
AGAIN.

21:20.012 --> 21:23.750
WHERE THE HELL'S
THAT GODDAMN WAITER?

21:26.886 --> 21:28.388
- YOU KNOW,
IT WASN'T SO LONG AGO

21:28.421 --> 21:32.925
YOU WERE A GODDAMN WAITER,
AND A MAID,

21:32.959 --> 21:36.329
AND A PORN STAR.

21:36.363 --> 21:37.930
BUT NOW, OF COURSE,

21:37.964 --> 21:40.400
PLANNING PARTIES
FOR EVERYONE IN TOWN.

21:40.433 --> 21:43.670
HEY, HOW ABOUT YOU THROW
A PARTY FOR ME, HUH?

21:43.703 --> 21:45.938
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

21:45.972 --> 21:48.007
- WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH--

21:48.040 --> 21:52.345
- IF YOU LOVE ME,
THEN YOU'LL THROW ME A PARTY.

21:52.379 --> 21:55.815
- FINE, YOU WANT A PARTY,
I'LL GIVE YOU A PARTY.

21:55.848 --> 21:57.550
- I'M HONORED.

21:57.584 --> 21:59.952
- SO, UH, WHAT--
WHAT KIND DO YOU WANT?

21:59.986 --> 22:01.554
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.

22:01.588 --> 22:04.424
SMALL, INTIMATE AFFAIR,
TOMORROW NIGHT.

22:04.457 --> 22:08.027
FOR SAY,
SIX OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS,

22:08.060 --> 22:12.098
SO EVERYTHING MUST, MUST,
MUST BE PERFECT.

22:12.131 --> 22:16.903
AM I MAKING MYSELF CLEAR?

22:16.936 --> 22:19.038
- CRYSTAL CLEAR.

22:19.071 --> 22:21.107
- EXCELLENT.

22:21.140 --> 22:24.711
THEN I'LL LEAVE IT
IN YOUR CAPABLE HANDS.

22:24.744 --> 22:27.847
OH, AT LAST,
THE GODDAMN WAITER.

22:27.880 --> 22:31.584
[chuckles]

22:31.618 --> 22:33.520
[knock at door]

22:45.432 --> 22:47.734
- WHO YOU GOT A DATE WITH
THIS TIME, VIC?

22:47.767 --> 22:49.936
- I WAS HOPING YOU.

22:49.969 --> 22:53.005
- NOT INTERESTED.

22:53.039 --> 22:55.508
- WILL YOU LISTEN?

22:58.978 --> 23:02.615
- TALK FAST.
I GOT ICE CREAM MELTING.

23:02.649 --> 23:06.085
- SINCE WHEN IS ICE CREAM
ON YOUR DIET?

23:06.118 --> 23:09.088
- SINCE WHEN IS WHAT I EAT
ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS?

23:09.121 --> 23:10.957
- LOOK, I JUST WANT
TO EXPLAIN--

23:10.990 --> 23:13.893
- YEAH, WELL,
SAVE YOUR BREATH,

23:13.926 --> 23:15.762
AND YOUR EXPLANATIONS.

23:15.795 --> 23:17.029
- DEBBIE, HONEY, PLEASE--

23:17.063 --> 23:19.165
- DON'T YOU CALL ME HONEY.

23:19.198 --> 23:21.100
- LOOK, I'M SORRY,

23:21.133 --> 23:22.802
BUT YOU'VE GOT
TO UNDERSTAND--

23:22.835 --> 23:24.571
- YEAH, THAT WITH ALL
THE FUCKING EVIDENCE

23:24.604 --> 23:26.038
IN THE WORLD STARING YOU
RIGHT IN THE FACE,

23:26.072 --> 23:29.509
YOU STILL REFUSE
TO OPEN THE CASE.

23:29.542 --> 23:32.912
- LOOK, IF I PROCEED
WITH THIS INVESTIGATION,

23:32.945 --> 23:34.547
AND IT TURNS OUT
THAT STOCKWELL

23:34.581 --> 23:36.649
IS ONLY TRYING TO PROTECT
HIS FORMER PARTNER,

23:36.683 --> 23:38.951
NOT TO MENTION HIMSELF--
- YOU'D BE A HERO.

23:38.985 --> 23:43.523
- I'D BE A DEAD MAN.

23:43.556 --> 23:45.057
AT LEAST AS FAR
AS MY FUTURE

23:45.091 --> 23:48.194
WITH THE PITTSBURGH P.D.
IS CONCERNED.

23:48.227 --> 23:50.930
I'VE BEEN WITH THE FORCE
FOR 24 YEARS.

23:50.963 --> 23:54.667
I CAN RETIRE SOON.

23:54.701 --> 23:57.970
I JUST WANT
TO COLLECT MY PENSION

23:58.004 --> 24:01.608
AND GO HOME.

24:03.743 --> 24:09.215
- THEN BY ALL MEANS, CARL,
THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD DO.

24:09.248 --> 24:10.850
GO PLANT TOMATOES
IN YOUR GARDEN

24:10.883 --> 24:16.856
AND WATCH THE GAME
FROM YOUR BARCALOUNGER.

24:16.889 --> 24:18.991
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I DO HAVE A DATE

24:19.025 --> 24:22.128
WITH A PINT OF CHOCOLATE--

24:22.161 --> 24:24.864
CHOCOLATE CHIP.

24:30.870 --> 24:32.839
- I GOTTA RUN, GUYS,
I'M GONNA BE LATE.

24:32.872 --> 24:34.741
- CAN YOU BELIEVE
ALL THESE FORMS?

24:34.774 --> 24:35.875
YOU'D THINK WE WERE APPLYING
FOR A BANK LOAN.

24:35.908 --> 24:37.143
- OR CITIZENSHIP.

24:37.176 --> 24:39.045
- HEY, WATCH
WHERE YOU'RE GOING.

24:39.078 --> 24:40.046
ASSHOLE.

24:40.079 --> 24:41.781
MAKING FRIENDS ALREADY?

24:41.814 --> 24:44.617
- AT LEAST NOW WE FINALLY
GET TO KNOW ALL ABOUT YOU.

24:44.651 --> 24:47.019
- NAME?
- HUNTER.

24:47.053 --> 24:50.056
- HUNTER WHAT?
- JUST HUNTER.

24:50.089 --> 24:51.624
- YOU THINK
YOU'RE AN AGING ROCK DIVA?

24:51.658 --> 24:54.293
- LAST NAMES TEND TO GET
IN THE WAY OF MY WORK.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.996
- FROM NOW ON, THE ONLY WORK
YOU'RE DOING IS HOMEWORK.

24:57.029 --> 24:59.265
OUT WITH IT.

24:59.298 --> 25:01.033
- JAMES HUNTER MONTGOMERY.

25:01.067 --> 25:02.735
- NICE TO MEET YOU, JIMMY.

25:02.769 --> 25:04.771
- [chuckles]
SHUT UP.

25:04.804 --> 25:05.872
- WHEN WERE YOU BORN?

25:05.905 --> 25:07.073
- I WASN'T BORN.

25:07.106 --> 25:08.775
MY MOTHER WAS TOO DRUNK
TO GIVE BIRTH,

25:08.808 --> 25:10.042
SO I WAS DELIVERED,

25:10.076 --> 25:12.278
16 GLORIOUS YEARS AGO
LAST TUESDAY.

25:12.311 --> 25:14.180
- LAST TUESDAY?

25:14.213 --> 25:16.048
YOU HAD A BIRTHDAY LAST WEEK
AND YOU DIDN'T TELL US?

25:16.082 --> 25:18.050
- WE COULD'VE DONE SOMETHING
TO CELEBRATE.

25:18.084 --> 25:20.152
- LIKE BLOW OUT A CANDLE?

25:20.186 --> 25:21.621
I BLEW THREE TRICKS
THAT DAY.

25:21.654 --> 25:23.656
MADE 150 BUCKS.

25:23.690 --> 25:26.058
THAT'S WHAT I CALL
CELEBRATING.

25:30.229 --> 25:32.064
- THE PRESS HAS ENDORSED
YOUR CANDIDACY.

25:32.098 --> 25:34.166
- AND THE POLLS ALL FAVOR YOU
TO WIN.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.702
- IT'S PRACTICALLY A SHOO-IN.

25:35.735 --> 25:37.203
- WE ALL KNOW THE LAST WEEK
OF A CAMPAIGN,

25:37.236 --> 25:39.038
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.

25:39.071 --> 25:44.944
LET'S NOT COUNT OUR VOTES
UNTIL THEY'RE COUNTED.

25:44.977 --> 25:46.178
SEND HIM IN.

25:46.212 --> 25:48.915
WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME?

25:48.948 --> 25:50.549
- SURE.
- SURE.

26:03.129 --> 26:04.330
- THANKS FOR STOPPING BY.

26:04.363 --> 26:08.367
- ANY TIME, JIM.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.837
SO WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

26:10.870 --> 26:14.340
- I WAS THINKING MORE
OF WHAT I COULD DO FOR YOU.

26:14.373 --> 26:16.008
- EVEN BETTER.

26:16.042 --> 26:18.244
I'M SURE YOU'VE BEEN
FOLLOWING THE CAMPAIGN.

26:18.277 --> 26:20.346
- NO, ACTUALLY,
I'VE BEEN SO BUSY SHOPPING

26:20.379 --> 26:22.949
AND BLOW-DRYING MY HAIR.

26:22.982 --> 26:25.217
- [laughs]

26:25.251 --> 26:27.119
THEY'RE PREDICTING
THIS TIME NEXT WEEK,

26:27.153 --> 26:29.088
I'LL BE THE NEW MAYOR
OF PITTSBURGH.

26:29.121 --> 26:31.257
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

26:31.290 --> 26:32.859
YOU DID IT.

26:32.892 --> 26:35.227
- THANKS, IN NO SMALL PART,
TO YOU.

26:35.261 --> 26:36.228
HAVE A SEAT.

26:36.262 --> 26:37.730
- I'LL STAND.

26:42.301 --> 26:45.404
- I ASKED TO SEE YOU
BECAUSE I WANTED TO SAY

26:45.437 --> 26:48.407
HOW MUCH I REGRET
WHAT HAPPENED.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.142
- THAT'S VERY CLASSY
OF YOU.

26:50.176 --> 26:54.146
- AND THAT PERHAPS
I ACTED IN HASTE,

26:54.180 --> 26:56.282
MISJUDGED THE SITUATION.

26:56.315 --> 26:58.417
- NO APOLOGIES.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.987
NO REGRETS.

27:01.020 --> 27:03.255
- WE MADE A GREAT TEAM.

27:03.289 --> 27:05.291
YOU DID ME A GREAT SERVICE.

27:05.324 --> 27:09.261
- [laughs]

27:09.295 --> 27:11.764
ARE YOU OFFERING ME
MY JOB BACK?

27:11.798 --> 27:14.433
- I'M OFFERING YOU A FUTURE.

27:14.466 --> 27:19.271
THERE'S A LOT I CAN DO,
EVEN MORE THAN BEFORE.

27:19.305 --> 27:21.173
- HOW'S THAT?

27:21.207 --> 27:26.312
- YOU ALWAYS WANTED MY BACKERS
FOR YOUR CLIENT LIST.

27:26.345 --> 27:29.749
I CAN STILL DELIVER THEM,

27:29.782 --> 27:33.786
AND NOW YOU CAN KEEP THEM
ALL TO YOURSELF.

27:37.824 --> 27:40.793
[soft jazz music]

27:40.827 --> 27:44.063
- WELL, WOULD YOU LOOK
AT THIS.

27:44.096 --> 27:45.431
SOME ENCHANTED EVENING.

27:45.464 --> 27:48.334
- GLAD IT MEETS
WITH YOUR APPROVAL.

27:48.367 --> 27:51.470
- MUST BE COSTING ME
A PRETTY PENNY,

27:51.503 --> 27:53.773
BUT SINCE I DON'T HAVE A PENNY,
PRETTY OR OTHERWISE,

27:53.806 --> 27:55.474
COST IS NO OBJECT.

27:55.507 --> 27:58.845
[silverware clinking]

28:05.084 --> 28:08.054
[music stops]

28:08.087 --> 28:09.789
[rock music playing]

28:09.822 --> 28:11.223
[knocking at door]

28:11.257 --> 28:16.829
- [gasps]
WHY, IT MUST BE OUR GUESTS.

28:19.899 --> 28:22.101
HEY!

28:22.134 --> 28:23.469
GUYS, COME ON IN.
COME IN, COME IN.

28:23.502 --> 28:26.105
EMMETT,
YOU KNOW DOCTOR MARK.

28:26.138 --> 28:27.339
HEY, COME ON IN, GUYS.

28:27.373 --> 28:29.508
- THANKS, MAN.
- YO, THIS IS COOL.

28:29.541 --> 28:32.378
- IT LOOKS LIKE ELTON JOHN'S
OSCAR BASH.

28:32.411 --> 28:34.013
- THANKS TO NONE OTHER

28:34.046 --> 28:35.381
THAN PITTSBURGH'S PREEMINENT
PARTY PLANNER,

28:35.414 --> 28:37.349
AND OUR HOSTESS
FOR THE EVENING,

28:37.383 --> 28:39.819
EMMETT HONEYCUTT.

28:39.852 --> 28:41.988
- WELL, IF WE'RE GOING
TO PARTY,

28:42.021 --> 28:44.857
WE MIGHT AS WELL
MAKE OURSELVES COMFORTABLE.

28:44.891 --> 28:47.126
- HEY, THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

28:47.159 --> 28:48.828
- AND IF YOU'RE OBSERVANT,

28:48.861 --> 28:52.398
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO DISCERN
TONIGHT'S THEME.

28:52.431 --> 28:54.901
SEE, ALL OF EM'S
DIVINE CREATIONS

28:54.934 --> 28:56.268
HAVE LITTLE THEMES
TO THEM.

28:56.302 --> 28:58.537
I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.973
CRYSTAL GOBLETS,
CRYSTAL PLATES,

29:01.007 --> 29:02.074
CRYSTAL NUT DISHES,

29:02.108 --> 29:03.876
CRYSTAL CANDLESTICKS.

29:03.910 --> 29:07.146
- THEN IT'S A GOOD THING
I BROUGHT THIS.

29:07.179 --> 29:08.247
- AWW.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.149
[laughs]

29:10.182 --> 29:12.384
OH, HE'S SO MUCH MORE
THOUGHTFUL THAN FLOWERS OR WINE,

29:12.418 --> 29:15.554
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE, EM?

29:15.587 --> 29:17.924
- THERE YOU GO.

29:21.027 --> 29:22.028
- WHERE'D YOU GET THAT?

29:22.061 --> 29:24.396
- DOCTOR MARK GAVE IT TO ME.

29:24.430 --> 29:26.565
- I MAKE THEM MYSELF
FROM MY MEDICAL SUPPLIES.

29:26.598 --> 29:28.534
- [chuckles]

29:28.567 --> 29:29.936
- HOW NICE TO KNOW
OUR INSURANCE DOLLARS

29:29.969 --> 29:31.270
AREN'T GOING TO WASTE.

29:31.303 --> 29:33.572
- [chuckles]

29:33.605 --> 29:35.942
- I HOPE, UH,
EVERYONE WILL TRY

29:35.975 --> 29:37.543
THE ASPARAGUS
AND GOAT CHEESE SOUFFLES?

29:37.576 --> 29:40.446
THEY'RE A SPECIALTY.

29:40.479 --> 29:42.148
- I THINK THAT PIPE
LOOKS A LITTLE EMPTY.

29:42.181 --> 29:44.316
- UH, THERE'S ALSO, UM,
POPCORN SHRIMP,

29:44.350 --> 29:48.054
AND, UH, SEARED AHI, UH,
TUNA--

30:15.614 --> 30:19.351
- [sighs]

30:19.385 --> 30:20.819
[distant, indistinct chatter]

30:34.901 --> 30:37.336
- AND NO SOONER
DO I TALK TO REICHERT,

30:37.369 --> 30:39.238
THEN WHO SHOULD CALL ME
BUT STOCKWELL,

30:39.271 --> 30:42.508
WANTING TO KISS
AND MAKE UP.

30:42.541 --> 30:43.976
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?

30:44.010 --> 30:45.477
- HE HAD A CHANGE OF HEART?

30:45.511 --> 30:47.379
- OR MAYBE THAT
AFTER OUR LITTLE VISIT,

30:47.413 --> 30:50.116
REICHERT CALLED HIS OLD PAL
AND NOW HE'S SCARED SHITLESS.

30:50.149 --> 30:53.652
- REICHERT'S DEAD.

30:53.685 --> 30:56.222
I WENT TO BRING HIM IN
FOR QUESTIONING.

30:56.255 --> 31:00.526
I FOUND HIM
IN THE GARAGE.

31:00.559 --> 31:05.131
HE WASHED HIS CAR
AND SHOT HIMSELF IN THE HEAD.

31:13.439 --> 31:15.541
- WHAT A SHAME.

31:15.574 --> 31:18.410
LOOKS LIKE RAIN.

31:45.704 --> 31:48.540
- WELL, IF IT ISN'T
LITTLE MARY SUNSHINE.

31:48.574 --> 31:51.410
- LITTLE MARY SUNSHINE DIED.

31:51.443 --> 31:54.580
I'M LITTLE MARY
GO FUCK YOURSELF.

31:54.613 --> 31:56.315
- HOW WAS THE SOFA?

31:56.348 --> 31:59.685
- WHERE'S A GOOD CHIROPRACTOR
WHEN YOU NEED ONE?

31:59.718 --> 32:03.155
SORRY.

32:03.189 --> 32:04.290
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO BE?

32:04.323 --> 32:06.025
- IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE A CAKE.

32:06.058 --> 32:08.460
- WHY DIDN'T YOU HAVE VIC
MAKE YOU ONE OF HIS?

32:08.494 --> 32:10.429
- BECAUSE I WANTED
AN OLD-FASHIONED,

32:10.462 --> 32:11.563
BETTY CROCKER
TRIPLE-LAYER,

32:11.597 --> 32:13.565
LIKE MY MOM USED TO MAKE.

32:13.599 --> 32:15.701
- TOO BAD IT DIDN'T TURN OUT
LIKE HERS.

32:15.734 --> 32:18.470
- IT TURNED OUT
EXACTLY LIKE HERS.

32:18.504 --> 32:19.471
- [chuckles]

32:19.505 --> 32:21.173
HMM.

32:21.207 --> 32:26.612
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE
IF WE CAN EVEN IT OUT.

32:26.645 --> 32:29.615
HMM, IT'S JUST LIKE OLD TIMES,
HUH?

32:29.648 --> 32:32.718
YOU AND ME, ROOMIES.

32:32.751 --> 32:34.720
WHAT'S THE OCCASION?

32:34.753 --> 32:36.122
- IT'S HUNTER'S BIRTHDAY.

32:36.155 --> 32:37.189
WE'RE--WE'RE GIVING HIM
A PARTY.

32:37.223 --> 32:38.590
DO YOU WANT TO COME?

32:38.624 --> 32:43.229
- MM, I WOULDN'T
BE MUCH FUN.

32:43.262 --> 32:45.097
- YOU KNOW YOU CAN STAY HERE
AS LONG AS YOU WANT.

32:45.131 --> 32:47.499
- THANKS, SWEETIE,

32:47.533 --> 32:49.335
BUT YOU HAVE A FULL HOUSE,

32:49.368 --> 32:52.204
AND I HAVE TO FACE TED.

32:52.238 --> 32:54.740
I SPENT THE ENTIRE NIGHT
ON THAT LUMPY SOFA,

32:54.773 --> 32:57.209
PREPARING WHAT TO SAY.

32:57.243 --> 32:58.344
- THINK HE'LL LISTEN?

32:58.377 --> 33:00.746
- I DON'T KNOW,

33:00.779 --> 33:06.218
BUT HE'LL DAMN WELL
HEAR ME.

33:06.252 --> 33:07.519
THERE.

33:07.553 --> 33:09.088
NOW ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS FROST IT,

33:09.121 --> 33:10.489
AND HUNTER'LL HAVE
A BIRTHDAY CAKE

33:10.522 --> 33:15.661
THAT WOULD MAKE BETTY
AND YOUR MAMA PROUD.

33:15.694 --> 33:19.131
- I WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE
TO THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD,

33:19.165 --> 33:21.133
TO THE FACULTY
AND STUDENTS

33:21.167 --> 33:23.369
OF PITTSBURGH INSTITUTE
OF FINE ART,

33:23.402 --> 33:26.405
FOR ANY EMBARRASSMENT
I MAY HAVE CAUSED THEM.

33:26.438 --> 33:30.509
ALSO, IF, BY MY BEHAVIOR,

33:30.542 --> 33:36.148
I HAVE IN ANY WAY DAMAGED
THE INTERNSHIP PROGRAM,

33:36.182 --> 33:41.387
I AM TRULY SORRY.

33:41.420 --> 33:43.655
- THE BOARD ACCEPTS
YOUR APOLOGY, MR. TAYLOR.

33:43.689 --> 33:46.658
YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY TAKEN TIME
TO CONSIDER YOUR BEHAVIOR,

33:46.692 --> 33:48.294
WHICH, REGRETTABLY,
YOU DID NOT DO

33:48.327 --> 33:50.429
BEFORE YOU ACTED SO HASTILY

33:50.462 --> 33:52.131
AND INAPPROPRIATELY.

33:52.164 --> 33:54.566
HOWEVER, GIVEN THE GRAVITY
OF THE SITUATION,

33:54.600 --> 33:57.436
WE FEEL SOME SORT OF
DISCIPLINARY ACTION IS REQUIRED.

33:57.469 --> 33:59.171
WE THEREFORE EXPECT YOU
TO WRITE A LETTER

33:59.205 --> 34:01.440

34:04.743 --> 34:07.813
YOU MAY HAVE CAUSED HIM
OR HIS FIRM.

34:07.846 --> 34:11.817
FURTHERMORE, YOU WILL APOLOGIZE
TO POLICE CHIEF STOCKWELL.

34:11.850 --> 34:15.187
- NO.

34:15.221 --> 34:16.588
- DID YOU SAY SOMETHING?

34:16.622 --> 34:18.290
- YEAH, I WON'T DO IT.

34:18.324 --> 34:20.292
I WILL NOT APOLOGIZE

34:20.326 --> 34:24.863
- I'M AFRAID, MR. TAYLOR,
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE.

34:24.896 --> 34:27.833
- NO CHOICE?

34:27.866 --> 34:30.702
YEAH, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT HE'D LIKE ME TO HAVE.

34:30.736 --> 34:32.738
HE'S ALREADY TAKEN AWAY
MY RIGHT TO ASSEMBLE,

34:32.771 --> 34:35.574
MY--MY RIGHT TO FUCK,
MY--

34:35.607 --> 34:39.245

ABOUT YOU BEING GAY.

34:39.278 --> 34:41.713
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S NOT.

34:41.747 --> 34:43.315
IT'S ABOUT FREEDOM
OF EXPRESSION

34:43.349 --> 34:45.351
AS A PERSON AND AN ARTIST,

34:45.384 --> 34:47.586
WITHOUT FEAR OF CENSURE
OR REPRISAL.

34:47.619 --> 34:50.756
THAT'S WHY I WILL NOT
APOLOGIZE TO HIM,

34:50.789 --> 34:54.493
HERE OR UNDER ANY OTHER
CIRCUMSTANCE.

34:54.526 --> 34:56.362
- HEY, YOU LEAVING

34:56.395 --> 34:58.464

34:58.497 --> 35:02.201
- [laughs]
HOW DO YOU DO IT?

35:02.234 --> 35:04.370
- AS WITH EVERYTHING,
THE SECRET IS MODERATION.

35:04.403 --> 35:09.475
[laughter]

35:09.508 --> 35:11.210
- OH, LOOK WHO IT IS.

35:11.243 --> 35:12.378
THE PARTY'S OVER.

35:12.411 --> 35:13.879
- THE PARTY'S NEVER OVER,

35:13.912 --> 35:15.481
AND SOME FRIENDS
ARE STOPPING BY THIS EVENING.

35:15.514 --> 35:17.483
- I'LL BE THERE.

35:17.516 --> 35:19.818
- I'D ASK YOU TO CATER IT,
BUT WE'RE WATCHING OUR WEIGHT.

35:19.851 --> 35:21.787
[laughs]

35:33.799 --> 35:35.801
- NOBODY TOUCHED A THING.

35:35.834 --> 35:38.270
- IT WAS TOO BEAUTIFUL
TO EAT.

35:38.304 --> 35:40.772
- MORE LIKE TOO TWEAKED
TO EAT.

35:40.806 --> 35:43.709
[sniffs]
UGH, THIS PLACE REEKS.

35:51.983 --> 35:53.452
- SO WHERE'D YOU GO?

35:53.485 --> 35:54.786
- DOES IT MATTER?

35:54.820 --> 35:57.523
- OF COURSE IT MATTERS.
YOU EMBARRASSED ME.

35:57.556 --> 35:59.658
- I EMBARRASSED YOU?

35:59.691 --> 36:02.361
- IT WAS EXTREMELY RUDE
FOR YOU TO JUST TAKE OFF.

36:02.394 --> 36:03.662
MY FRIENDS THINK
YOU DON'T LIKE THEM.

36:03.695 --> 36:06.698
- I DON'T.

36:06.732 --> 36:09.968
- AND SINCE WHEN DID YOU
GET SO FUCKING SUPERIOR?

36:10.001 --> 36:12.938
YOU THINK BECAUSE YOU PUT
A PIECE OF CHEESE ON A CRACKER

36:12.971 --> 36:14.573
AND YOU PAWN IT OFF
AS CHIC

36:14.606 --> 36:15.807
THAT SOMEHOW YOU'RE BETTER
THAN EVERYONE?

36:15.841 --> 36:17.409
WELL, LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

36:17.443 --> 36:19.311
NO MATTER HOW MANY
FANCY PARTIES YOU GIVE,

36:19.345 --> 36:20.979
OR HOW MUCH MONEY
THEY GIVE YOU TO GIVE THEM,

36:21.012 --> 36:22.581
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE
A PIECE OF TRASH

36:22.614 --> 36:24.316
FROM HAZLEHURST,
MISSISSIPPI.

36:24.350 --> 36:26.952
- I DON'T NEED YOU
TO TELL ME THAT,

36:26.985 --> 36:29.288
BECAUSE I TELL MYSELF THAT
EVERY DAY,

36:29.321 --> 36:31.423
BUT AT LEAST I AM NOT
A TWEAKED OUT,

36:31.457 --> 36:36.462
FUCKED OUT
CRYSTAL QUEEN.

36:36.495 --> 36:40.332
- [sniffs]

36:40.366 --> 36:42.834
- TEDDY, PLEASE.

36:42.868 --> 36:45.337
OKAY?
IT IS NOT TOO LATE.

36:45.371 --> 36:47.973
YOU CAN STILL BE YOU AGAIN.

36:48.006 --> 36:50.976
MY SWEET, UPTIGHT ACCOUNTANT
WHO WOULD FREAK OUT

36:51.009 --> 36:53.445
IF SOMEONE PUT DOWN A GLASS
WITHOUT A COASTER.

36:53.479 --> 36:56.848
- I--

36:56.882 --> 37:02.788
I DON'T WANT
TO BE ME ANYMORE.

37:02.821 --> 37:08.460
OKAY?
I HATED THAT PERSON.

37:08.494 --> 37:10.462
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN MY LIFE,

37:10.496 --> 37:13.532
I AM RELAXED,
I AM HAPPY,

37:13.565 --> 37:18.370
AND I AM HAVING FUN.

37:18.404 --> 37:21.507
- YOU CALL THIS FUN?

37:21.540 --> 37:25.744
THIS IS PATHETIC.

37:25.777 --> 37:27.613
- PATHETIC?

37:27.646 --> 37:28.780
- YEAH.

37:28.814 --> 37:34.620
- THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK I AM?

37:34.653 --> 37:38.524
- [sobbing]
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

37:38.557 --> 37:41.026
I DON'T NEED YOU
CRITICIZING ME

37:41.059 --> 37:43.929
AND MAKING ME
FEEL LIKE SHIT, OKAY?

37:43.962 --> 37:46.898
[sniffs]

37:46.932 --> 37:49.034
I AM BEAUTIFUL.

37:49.067 --> 37:51.370
EVERYTHING IS BEAUTIFUL,

37:51.403 --> 37:52.638
AND IF YOU DON'T
SEE IT THAT WAY,

37:52.671 --> 37:56.442
YOU CAN JUST
GET THE FUCK OUT.

38:27.739 --> 38:30.476
[sniffs]

38:30.509 --> 38:31.977
- THIS IS COOL SHIT, DUDE,

38:32.010 --> 38:33.679
BUT I COULD'VE
SAVED YOU SOME BUCKS.

38:33.712 --> 38:34.880
- YEAH, RUNNING FOR THE DOOR

38:34.913 --> 38:36.348
WHILE YOU
DISTRACT THE SALESPERSON

38:36.382 --> 38:39.084
IS NOT EXACTLY MY STYLE.

38:39.117 --> 38:44.956
all: SURPRISE!

38:44.990 --> 38:50.962
[cheering,
noisemakers blowing]

38:50.996 --> 38:53.899
- WELL, AREN'T YOU
GOING TO SAY SOMETHING?

38:53.932 --> 38:56.502
- WHAT THE FUCK'S GOING ON?
- SWEET KID, ISN'T HE?

38:56.535 --> 38:59.571
- IT'S A--
IT'S A SURPRISE PARTY.

38:59.605 --> 39:01.106
- FOR WHO?

39:01.139 --> 39:03.041
- FOR YOU.
IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY.

39:03.074 --> 39:04.976
NOW, COME SAY HELLO.

39:05.010 --> 39:06.845
THIS IS MELANIE AND LINDSAY.

I MADE IT MYSELF.

39:17.623 --> 39:19.991
- IT'S A BETTY CROCKER
GOLDEN FUDGE,

39:20.025 --> 39:22.528
THE SAME KIND I USED
TO MAKE FOR YOU, HONEY.

39:22.561 --> 39:26.131
- AWW.

- ONE, TWO, THREE--

39:37.576 --> 39:38.677

39:38.710 --> 39:40.145
YOU HAVE TO MAKE A WISH.

39:40.178 --> 39:41.613
- YOU SCARED THE SHIT
OUT OF ME.

39:41.647 --> 39:42.681
- FOR WHAT?

39:42.714 --> 39:44.015
- SOMETHING YOU WANT.

39:44.049 --> 39:47.085
- MORE THAN ANYTHING.

39:47.118 --> 39:48.954
- HMM.

39:52.724 --> 39:56.795
[all cheering and applauding]

40:00.131 --> 40:05.036
- ALL RIGHT.

40:05.070 --> 40:10.842
[indistinct chatter]

40:10.876 --> 40:14.513
- SORRY I'M LATE
FOR THE SURPRISE.

40:14.546 --> 40:17.849
TED KICKED ME OUT.

40:17.883 --> 40:20.919
- OH, EM.
I'M SORRY.

40:20.952 --> 40:23.655
- I TRIED, MICHAEL.
I SWEAR I DID.

40:23.689 --> 40:24.823
- I KNOW YOU DID.
I KNOW.

40:24.856 --> 40:27.459
- THERE WAS NOTHING
I COULD DO.

40:27.493 --> 40:28.994

YEAH, YOU TOO.

40:31.963 --> 40:34.199
- COME, COME ON, COME ON,
JOIN US.

40:34.232 --> 40:37.135
- THE LAST THING YOU NEED
AT A FESTIVE OCCASION

40:37.168 --> 40:41.540
IS A GUEST ON THE VERGE
OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN, SO...

40:41.573 --> 40:46.211
BESIDES, I, UH,
NEED TO FIND A PLACE TO LIVE.

40:46.244 --> 40:49.147
- YOU CAN STAY WITH US.

40:49.180 --> 40:51.550
- THAT IS, IF YOU DON'T MIND
A ROWDY TWO-YEAR-OLD.

40:51.583 --> 40:54.152
- AND A CRANKY PREGNANT LADY.

40:54.185 --> 40:56.588
- AFTER WHAT I SAID
TO YOU?

40:56.622 --> 41:00.225
- NO WORSE THAN
WHAT I CALLED YOU.

41:00.258 --> 41:03.028
- YOU WERE RIGHT.

41:03.061 --> 41:05.163
I AM JUST A SILLY FAGGOT.

41:05.196 --> 41:06.832
- NO.

41:06.865 --> 41:08.834
YOU STOOD BESIDE
YOUR PARTNER,

41:08.867 --> 41:11.102
NO MATTER WHAT ANYONE SAID,

41:11.136 --> 41:13.705
AND THAT MAKES YOU
A VERY LOYAL,

41:13.739 --> 41:16.742
VERY BRAVE FAGGOT.

41:21.947 --> 41:24.115

41:24.149 --> 41:26.918
- THANKS, DEB.

HUNTER?

41:28.620 --> 41:30.589
IT WAS ONE HELL
OF A SURPRISE.

41:30.622 --> 41:31.990
- HUH?

41:32.023 --> 41:33.191
RIGHT ON.

41:33.224 --> 41:34.993

41:35.026 --> 41:36.194
- THANKS.

41:36.227 --> 41:38.730
- YOU'RE A GOOD MAN,
MICHAEL.

41:38.764 --> 41:40.198
- I AM?

41:40.231 --> 41:44.269
- I WOULDN'T SAY SO
IF IT WASN'T TRUE.

41:44.302 --> 41:47.272
VIC, FOR CHRIST'S SAKES,
WHAT'S TAKING YOU SO LONG?

41:47.305 --> 41:49.140
- I'M WAITING FOR YOU.

41:49.174 --> 41:50.141
- OH.

41:50.175 --> 41:53.078
[laughter]

41:53.111 --> 41:54.946
OKAY.

41:54.980 --> 41:56.147
BYE, HONEY.
- BYE-BYE.

41:56.181 --> 41:59.685
- THANK YOU.

42:03.589 --> 42:05.924
- I LOVE YOU.

42:09.595 --> 42:12.831
- DID YOU HEAR
WHAT MY MOM SAID?

42:12.864 --> 42:14.165
- THAT YOU'RE A GOOD MAN?

42:14.199 --> 42:15.734
I COULD'VE TOLD YOU THAT.

42:21.339 --> 42:24.910
HMM.

42:24.943 --> 42:26.678
SO YOU GOT
SOME PRETTY NEAT STUFF.

42:26.712 --> 42:30.649
[Game Boy beeping]

42:30.682 --> 42:34.052
ARE YOU GOING OUT?

42:34.085 --> 42:37.022
- MAYBE LATER.

42:39.758 --> 42:41.660
- SO THE GUY'S DEAD.

42:41.693 --> 42:43.194
THAT ONLY PROVES
THAT HE DID IT,

42:43.228 --> 42:44.863
AND THAT'S
WHY HE KILLED HIMSELF,

42:44.896 --> 42:47.265
TO AVOID DISGRACE
AND TO PROTECT STOCKWELL,

42:47.298 --> 42:49.267
WHO I SUSPECT
HE SECRETLY LOVED.

42:49.300 --> 42:52.237
- LEAVE IT TO A QUEEN
TO TURN ANYTHING INTO A DRAMA.

42:52.270 --> 42:53.872
- WHAT ELSE COULD IT BE?

42:53.905 --> 42:57.108
- WE'LL NEVER KNOW.
HE'LL NEVER TELL.

42:57.142 --> 42:58.677
- SO IT'S OVER?

42:58.710 --> 43:00.211
- YEAH, IT'S OVER.
- NO, IT'S--

43:00.245 --> 43:03.014
NAH.
IT CAN'T BE OVER.

43:03.048 --> 43:05.283
- THIS TIME NEXT WEEK,

43:05.316 --> 43:08.754
STOCKWELL WILL BE MAYOR,

43:08.787 --> 43:11.222
AND I'LL BE COLLECTING
UNEMPLOYMENT.

43:11.256 --> 43:13.759
- WELL, I WILL BE
ON THE STREET,

43:13.792 --> 43:14.826
PEDDLING MY ASS
OR MY ART,

43:14.860 --> 43:16.294
WHICHEVER MAKES MORE MONEY.

43:16.327 --> 43:21.166
- YEAH, WELL, DON'T SPEND
TOO MUCH ON FRAMING.

43:21.199 --> 43:24.703

43:24.736 --> 43:25.837

43:25.871 --> 43:28.707
- OH, DON'T LOOK
SO DISAPPOINTED.

43:28.740 --> 43:31.777
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY
FOR MY EDUCATION ANY MORE.

43:31.810 --> 43:33.845
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING
TO APOLOGIZE.

43:33.879 --> 43:35.180
- I DID APOLOGIZE,

43:35.213 --> 43:37.849
BUT THEN THEY WANTED ME
TO APOLOGIZE TO HIM,

43:37.883 --> 43:39.117
AND I COULDN'T.

43:39.150 --> 43:41.052
I COULDN'T SAY "I'M SORRY"

43:41.086 --> 43:42.387
TO SOMEONE
WHO'D RATHER SEE ME DEAD--

43:42.420 --> 43:44.656
ALL OF US DEAD--

43:44.690 --> 43:48.026
THAN BE PART OF
HIS FAMILY-FRIENDLY WORLD.

43:52.297 --> 43:56.401
- SO YOU SACRIFICED
EVERYTHING?

43:56.434 --> 43:59.637
- SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO
FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN.

44:15.787 --> 44:19.324
- * YOU'VE SEEN YOUR SHARE
