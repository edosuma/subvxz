00:15.181 --> 00:17.183
[gulls calling]

00:20.603 --> 00:23.148
[woman 1 in Spanish]
I'm always dreaming of Puerto Rico.

00:29.404 --> 00:33.575
I have dreamed of the town I lived in
with my friends.

00:38.455 --> 00:42.208
[woman 2 in Spanish]  In Puerto Rico,
I have happiness. I have stability.

00:49.674 --> 00:53.219
[woman 3 in Spanish]  Life in Puerto Rico
was beautiful, but also difficult.

00:55.388 --> 00:59.184
But let me tell you, 
the food, the people...

01:01.811 --> 01:03.980
One day, I'll go back to my island.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.095
[woman 3]  She stormed in like a monster,

01:36.054 --> 01:38.973
completely devastating Puerto Rico.

01:40.141 --> 01:42.143
[bugs chirping]

02:04.541 --> 02:07.418
-[in Spanish] Is it open?
-[woman] Yes, the door is open.

02:08.628 --> 02:12.924
[Nilda]  After the hurricane passed,
everything was destroyed.

02:14.759 --> 02:16.803
It didn't look like the same island.

02:21.683 --> 02:25.395
[woman 3] The first thing that failed
was the communications system.

02:26.479 --> 02:31.526
There was no cell reception,
no ATMs, no bank system.

02:31.609 --> 02:34.279
It didn't matter if you had money or not.

02:38.116 --> 02:40.952
The government said,
"Prepare yourselves for two weeks."

02:41.703 --> 02:45.665
Everyone prepared. 
Most of the people did. I did too.

02:46.666 --> 02:50.128
But I never thought that,
even two weeks in, it'd still be chaos.

02:52.255 --> 02:54.382
[woman 2]
I had never seen Puerto Rico like that.

02:56.342 --> 02:57.760
You'd go out on the streets,

02:58.261 --> 03:01.848
and you would see all the trees 
without any leaves,

03:01.931 --> 03:05.351
destroyed houses, 
people crying and yelling outside.

03:07.729 --> 03:11.065
By 5:00 or 6:00 p.m., night would come,

03:11.149 --> 03:15.153
and it was very dark. Too dark.

03:16.821 --> 03:23.203
So we gathered
and slept in one room together, all of us,

03:23.286 --> 03:24.704
to be safe.

03:30.752 --> 03:32.837
[rustling]

03:34.839 --> 03:37.592
[Glenda] Half of my house was exposed.

03:38.927 --> 03:42.513
And then the rats and the snakes 
started to turn up,

03:42.597 --> 03:47.518
like they were fighting over who would be 
the last one to survive.

03:51.731 --> 03:55.860
FEMA arrived at my house two months later.

03:57.820 --> 04:00.698
They told me, "You cannot live here."

04:03.868 --> 04:05.870
[Nilda]  I didn't want to leave.

04:06.829 --> 04:09.499
I had my dog, Chico.

04:10.458 --> 04:12.460
I had my best friend.

04:16.464 --> 04:17.590
[Kenia] Easy.

04:17.674 --> 04:19.509
[Nilda]  But I had no choice.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.178
Things had to get better.

04:29.477 --> 04:32.897
But I was prepared to come here.

04:36.567 --> 04:38.778
[reporter in English]  Ten and a half
months since Hurricane Maria

04:38.861 --> 04:39.904
devastated Puerto Rico,

04:39.988 --> 04:43.199
nearly half the island 
still does not have electricity.

04:44.867 --> 04:46.369
[reporter 2]  The slow pace of recovery

04:46.452 --> 04:48.538
has lead hundreds of thousands
of Puerto Ricans,

04:48.621 --> 04:52.500
who are American citizens, 
to relocate on the U.S. mainland.

04:56.045 --> 04:58.047
[reporter 3]
Transitional shelter assistance

04:58.131 --> 05:01.801
provides hotel rooms
for displaced Puerto Ricans to live in.

05:01.884 --> 05:03.553
And they've got until June 30th

05:03.636 --> 05:06.889
before FEMA will finally 
discontinue the program.

05:06.973 --> 05:10.059
So they essentially will be homeless
at the end of June.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.292
[woman speaks indistinctly in Spanish]

05:34.375 --> 05:35.793
[Glenda in Spanish] Pretty! Look!

05:35.918 --> 05:39.505
And you haven't come to see me.
That's why I didn't show you.

05:39.964 --> 05:44.469
Look at this one. You like the big ones.
Look how cute this one is!

05:44.552 --> 05:47.013
-And you haven't come to see me.
- But I don't...

05:47.722 --> 05:51.809
- I don't like silver.
-This isn't silver. It's gold, sweetheart.

05:53.436 --> 05:56.814
Oh, are they bigger than these? 
The bigger, the better.

05:56.898 --> 06:00.151
Honey, these are 
the biggest ones there are.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.863
If they are bigger than these, 
I'll buy them.

06:04.238 --> 06:06.199
Where are you? At the park over there?

06:07.450 --> 06:08.326
Yeah.

06:08.409 --> 06:12.038
Are there more people there I can sell to?
I will sell these to everyone.

06:14.374 --> 06:17.418
[Glenda] Oh, I've got this bracelet 
that matches your eyes!

06:25.259 --> 06:27.595
[Glenda]  Six months, here in this hotel.

06:27.929 --> 06:29.514
...for school tomorrow.

06:29.597 --> 06:32.683
My husband and I share a room.

06:35.812 --> 06:37.355
Between four walls...

06:38.231 --> 06:40.316
all I could do was look out at the road.

06:43.027 --> 06:46.155
But, little by little, 
I began to leave the room.

06:48.699 --> 06:50.993
-[people cheering, clapping]
-[all] Surprise!

06:51.077 --> 06:54.831
-Come give me a hug.
-You're going to spray me!

06:55.456 --> 06:57.667
[yelling, laughing]

07:00.586 --> 07:02.338
Is there a stripper?

07:02.422 --> 07:04.132
Is there a stripper?

07:04.215 --> 07:06.801
Give me a hug and a kiss.

07:06.884 --> 07:08.886
[Glenda]  I met her here at the hotel.

07:09.971 --> 07:13.307
They are like family to me.

07:13.599 --> 07:15.726
-[indistinct chatter]
-No, no, no! [laughing]

07:15.852 --> 07:18.354
[Glenda]
I am the crazy one in this friendship.

07:18.813 --> 07:22.900
Kenia is very spontaneous. She always 
does something that makes you laugh.

07:24.318 --> 07:27.822
Sheila is a bit more serious. 
She's like our anchor.

07:30.074 --> 07:31.242
[indistinct chatter]

07:31.659 --> 07:34.328
-"Paint your hair yellow!"
-[women squealing]

[upbeat Latin music playing]

07:52.263 --> 07:53.973
[all cheering, clapping]

07:55.892 --> 07:58.436
-Let me make a wish. 
-[woman 1] I wish to have an apartment.

07:58.519 --> 08:01.939
[woman 2]
I wish to have a five-bedroom apartment!

08:02.023 --> 08:03.900
I wasn't just thinking about myself.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.861
-[woman 3] Come on, do it!
-[woman 2] Five rooms for all of us.

08:06.944 --> 08:08.488
[woman 3] The candles are moving.

08:08.571 --> 08:09.989
-[woman 1] Move.
-[woman 2] Do it!

08:10.072 --> 08:12.575
-[woman 3] Just blow. What's with you?
-[all chuckling]

08:12.658 --> 08:15.786
-[woman 1] It's not your birthday.
-I hope my wish comes true.

08:21.417 --> 08:23.836
[line ringing]

08:24.837 --> 08:26.547
[automated voice in English] 
You have reached

08:26.631 --> 08:29.217
the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

08:29.300 --> 08:33.346
[in Spanish]  For people who only
speak Spanish, say, "Spanish."

08:33.471 --> 08:35.932
-Spanish.
-[voice continues indistinctly, stops]

08:36.015 --> 08:37.975
[woman in Spanish]
Good afternoon. How can I assist you?

08:38.226 --> 08:41.896
[Kenia] I want to verify
when our hotel voucher is expiring, love.

08:41.979 --> 08:45.024
Do we stay until June 30th 
and leave July 1st?

08:46.275 --> 08:49.695
[woman]  Allow me to verify 
so I can give you the right information.

08:49.779 --> 08:52.990
-No problem. Don't worry, I'll hold.
- Thank you.

08:56.035 --> 08:58.371
I've always been nice to them because...

08:58.788 --> 09:01.624
what's the point of taking it out on them?

09:01.707 --> 09:03.251
[clucking softly]

09:03.334 --> 09:05.461
My heart'd be like...

09:05.545 --> 09:07.755
And they'd be like,
"Sure, ma'am. No problem."

09:07.838 --> 09:11.467
[woman]  All right, ma'am. 
You should be leaving July 1st,

09:11.551 --> 09:14.428
but you should verify the check-out time 
with the hotel.

09:14.512 --> 09:19.600
-The 30th, I sleep here. The 1st, I leave.
- That's right.

09:20.268 --> 09:23.771
-Right.
-Okay. Are there any updates?

09:24.772 --> 09:31.612
That's the latest information.
Can I help you with anything else?

09:31.696 --> 09:34.365
No. Thank you, love.
That'd be all. You're so kind.

09:34.448 --> 09:35.491
[line disconnects]

09:35.575 --> 09:37.493
Stay calm. Don't worry.

09:38.786 --> 09:42.540
They're the ones in charge.

09:43.416 --> 09:44.959
Let's hope for a miracle.

09:52.633 --> 09:55.511
[woman in English]  The evacuee
population that we work with,

09:55.595 --> 09:58.639
we've seen an ongoing hurricane, right?

09:58.723 --> 10:01.309
On the island, a hurricane passed.
It was devastating.

10:01.392 --> 10:02.768
There were long-term consequences.

10:02.852 --> 10:07.648
For the evacuees, that hurricane is being
renewed every month

10:08.024 --> 10:12.445
because they are living 
under perpetually precarious situations.

10:14.071 --> 10:17.241
They're trying to seek a job 
with a living wage,

10:17.325 --> 10:20.578
trying to get their children's needs met

10:20.661 --> 10:22.079
and healthcare issues met.

10:24.457 --> 10:28.377
It's an ongoing survival mode.

10:30.087 --> 10:31.297
[indistinct chatter]

10:37.053 --> 10:39.305
[in Spanish] There is an apartment
for rent. We should ask.

10:39.930 --> 10:41.932
-What?
-It could be nice.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.393
-"For rent"?
-Does it say?

10:44.477 --> 10:45.603
Over there.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.439
[announcement over PA]
Please exit at the rear door.

10:51.525 --> 10:53.527
[soft Latin dance music plays]

11:00.534 --> 11:03.537
[Glenda]  We got married on June 7th, 2017.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.251
Four months before the hurricane.

11:16.634 --> 11:19.679
I've had my highs and lows in love

11:19.762 --> 11:22.848
because I've had four partners before.

11:24.016 --> 11:28.688
I asked God to bring a good man 
into my life, and he showed up.

11:29.689 --> 11:33.609
And he opened my heart to love again.

11:41.826 --> 11:42.660
Come here.

11:44.453 --> 11:45.413
Ouch!

11:45.496 --> 11:47.498
[Glenda]  After Hurricane Maria,

11:47.748 --> 11:52.545
I sat down with my husband
and told him we needed to leave.

11:52.628 --> 11:54.505
Life's not easy.

11:57.341 --> 11:59.760
I have tumors in my throat.

11:59.844 --> 12:03.597
The hospital system was down,
there was no electricity,

12:03.681 --> 12:07.476
and many doctors had left Puerto Rico.

12:11.439 --> 12:13.065
[Glenda] This is the one you want, right?

12:13.149 --> 12:14.692
[woman on phone]  Yes. I want a large.

12:14.775 --> 12:16.527
Sounds good. I'll get it for you.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.989
These are Louis Vuitton.

12:20.072 --> 12:22.450
If you take two, I'll sell both for $25.

12:24.744 --> 12:27.705
[Glenda]
My husband works at a parking lot.

12:29.039 --> 12:33.794
So I'm trying to make extra money
to help him out.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.716
I try to be happy and cheerful.

12:46.307 --> 12:51.312
How can we make it in this city 
when it's so difficult to live here?

13:08.537 --> 13:09.914
[Kenia] Look, Nilda Lee,

13:10.372 --> 13:13.918
you just have to stay calm 
when you're in school. Don't worry.

13:15.044 --> 13:17.213
You aren't the one misbehaving.

13:17.296 --> 13:21.300
It's the other girls who are bullying you
and stealing your cell phone.

13:23.511 --> 13:26.764
You're very mature for being 11.

13:31.519 --> 13:34.647
I want you to look pretty
and well put together.

13:42.613 --> 13:45.074
[Nilda]
This is the first time I've been bullied.

13:47.743 --> 13:50.871
It didn't happen in Puerto Rico
because I had a lot of friends there.

13:56.293 --> 13:58.295
[muted chatter, laughter]

14:27.408 --> 14:30.160
[Nilda]  They don't get along with me. 
I don't speak English,

14:30.244 --> 14:34.665
and I'm from another country.
I am not from their country.

14:34.748 --> 14:37.501
They bully me and tell me stuff.

14:45.968 --> 14:47.052
[Kenia] This is our stop.

14:48.512 --> 14:49.430
Careful.

14:58.939 --> 15:00.608
She doesn't want to go to school.

15:05.654 --> 15:09.742
God, it's not easy.

15:13.954 --> 15:16.415
I miss my island. Oh, yeah.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.794
[Kenia]  We lived out in the country.

15:21.670 --> 15:25.799
The air was natural, fresh.

15:27.468 --> 15:29.762
It was completely quiet.

15:30.304 --> 15:32.306
Only the sound of roosters.

15:34.224 --> 15:35.351
I miss it.

15:36.644 --> 15:40.606
I would bring the Puerto Rican flag
with me, even to the moon.

15:42.358 --> 15:44.777
[Latin salsa music plays]

15:45.486 --> 15:48.238
[Glenda]  There are so many Puerto Ricans
here in the Bronx...

15:50.449 --> 15:53.661
sometimes it feels like
you're in Puerto Rico.

15:59.041 --> 16:02.711
[Kenia]
You're walking, and the cars pass by,

16:02.795 --> 16:05.130
and you can hear salsa music.

16:06.507 --> 16:11.011
You go, "Oh, look at that  boricua
with the music blasting!"

16:11.095 --> 16:13.055
[salsa music continues]

16:18.352 --> 16:22.481
[Kenia]  It reminds you that even though 
you're in a strange land,

16:23.774 --> 16:26.610
you're still on your island.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.744
[Glenda]   Those are the shoes

16:36.620 --> 16:41.792
-for each person that died in Puerto Rico.
-Yes.

16:42.543 --> 16:44.211
[reporter 1   in English]
According to a new study,

16:44.294 --> 16:46.380
the death toll from Hurricane Maria 
in Puerto Rico

16:46.463 --> 16:50.467
is more than 70 times higher 
than officials claim.

16:50.551 --> 16:53.804
[reporter 2]  With a death toll of 4,645,

16:53.887 --> 16:58.434
Hurricane Maria would become the second
deadliest hurricane in U.S. history.

16:58.517 --> 17:03.022
If you look at a real catastrophe 
like Katrina,

17:03.522 --> 17:08.444
and you look at the tremendous hundreds 
and hundreds of people that died,

17:08.902 --> 17:12.865
you can be proud of all of your people,
all of our people working together.

17:12.948 --> 17:15.367
[reporter 3]  The governor
is now highlighting the differences

17:15.451 --> 17:18.078
of the federal government's response 
to other hurricanes.

17:18.162 --> 17:20.289
My message to all political leaders...

17:20.789 --> 17:25.627
If they really, truly want to end
inequality with Puerto Rico,

17:25.711 --> 17:29.006
let's not only look at what happened 
in the past year,

17:29.089 --> 17:30.799
past couple of years in Puerto Rico.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.801
Let's look at the long-standing history.

17:33.469 --> 17:35.888
Puerto Rico is a colonial territory.

17:36.764 --> 17:40.476
Puerto Rican-U.S. citizens 
are second-class U.S. citizens.

17:41.018 --> 17:44.146
We have the most populated 
colonial territory in the world,

17:44.772 --> 17:46.231
but we don't have the right to vote.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.317
My ask is very simple:

17:48.942 --> 17:51.570
Do you support
eliminating colonial territories

17:51.653 --> 17:54.406
in the 21st century in the United States?

17:54.490 --> 17:57.076
Do you support statehood for Puerto Rico?

17:57.868 --> 18:00.037
All we're asking is to be treated equally.

18:02.331 --> 18:04.291
[Glenda] The whole world is watching.

18:04.374 --> 18:08.128
They don't have the courage to face us 
and say, "This is what happened."

18:08.212 --> 18:09.838
[indistinct news broadcast playing]

18:10.339 --> 18:13.300
-Trump came to throw paper towels...
-Mm-hmm.

18:13.634 --> 18:17.805
...for us to soak up our tears. 
You don't do that.

18:17.888 --> 18:22.851
[Trump]  I think that Puerto Rico 
was an incredible unsung success.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.145
It was one of the best jobs 
that's ever been done,

18:25.229 --> 18:27.314
with respect to what this is all about.

18:29.691 --> 18:32.319
[Kenia]  My father died
one month after I got here...

18:33.362 --> 18:35.197
of natural causes.

18:36.657 --> 18:38.534
But they didn't say why.

18:44.331 --> 18:47.167
It was due to lack of light, 
lack of hygiene.

18:48.335 --> 18:51.130
No water, no communication.

18:53.048 --> 18:56.051
We got here in November, 
and he died in December,

18:56.927 --> 18:58.929
and I couldn't go back to see him.

19:07.271 --> 19:08.605
But I'm not going to cry.

19:09.731 --> 19:15.070
I need to stay strong in my heart
to survive with my daughter.

19:27.332 --> 19:29.710
[line ringing]

19:33.338 --> 19:34.423
[continues ringing]

19:34.506 --> 19:36.550
[woman in English]  How can I help you?

19:36.633 --> 19:38.427
[in English]
You speak Spanish, please?

19:39.511 --> 19:41.388
[line clicks, music plays over phone]

19:41.471 --> 19:43.056
[music stops, line clicks]

19:43.140 --> 19:44.099
[man in English]  Hello?

19:44.183 --> 19:48.562
[in Spanish] I'm calling to see
if you have a two-bedroom apartment.

19:50.147 --> 19:51.815
[man in Spanish]
I don't have any right now,

19:51.899 --> 19:55.444
but if you leave your name and number,
I'll call you when one is available.

19:55.527 --> 19:58.030
[recorded voice in English]
Please leave a short, detailed message

19:58.113 --> 20:00.324
-so that we can get back to you.
-[beeping]

20:00.407 --> 20:02.826
[automated voice]
Sorry, there is no space for recording.

20:03.827 --> 20:05.913
[Glenda in English]
This is the real estate?

20:06.496 --> 20:07.956
[man in English]  Yes. Can I help you?

20:08.040 --> 20:09.458
You speak Spanish, please?

20:09.958 --> 20:11.293
No, I don't speak Spanish.

20:11.376 --> 20:15.130
Okay. You have the apartment 
for the two room?

20:15.214 --> 20:16.340
[loud chatter over phone]

20:16.423 --> 20:18.675
-[man]  No, um...
-What?

20:19.509 --> 20:21.053
No. No, we don't.

20:22.137 --> 20:23.055
[line disconnects]

20:23.138 --> 20:24.973
[thunder rumbles]

20:25.057 --> 20:27.601
[reporter 1 in English]  FEMA is
ending assistance for Puerto Ricans

20:27.684 --> 20:31.855
as many still struggle to recover after 
Hurricane Maria's devastating impact.

20:32.231 --> 20:35.108
In a statement,
FEMA said the program was, quote,

20:35.192 --> 20:40.197
"A temporary solution that bridges 
survivors into more permanent options."

20:40.280 --> 20:43.700
Permanent options tough to find 
in the tight rental market.

20:43.784 --> 20:46.995
Hurricane Maria survivors have to find
their own place to live

20:47.079 --> 20:50.415
or receive a one-way plane ticket 
back to Puerto Rico.

20:51.917 --> 20:54.378
[Glenda in Spanish]  FEMA is letting us go.

20:54.711 --> 20:59.549
We don't have the resources
to be able to move forward

20:59.633 --> 21:02.094
after we leave the hotel.

21:05.055 --> 21:06.348
[Natasha] It's unfortunate to say

21:06.431 --> 21:09.184
that there really has been no improvement
in Puerto Rico.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.813
I think if you go there, you may see,

21:12.896 --> 21:17.109
oh, there are some lights back on, 
there's street lamps up,

21:17.192 --> 21:20.028
some of the roads have been repaired.
Those are really superficial.

21:21.196 --> 21:24.700
When you see the closure of hundreds
of public schools,

21:24.783 --> 21:28.578
the cuts to the public university system,
the closure of health care clinics

21:28.662 --> 21:30.580
and parts of hospital wings.

21:31.999 --> 21:35.794
FEMA was offering just a one-way ticket
back to something.

21:35.877 --> 21:39.256
It didn't include a home, 
didn't include long-term housing.

21:43.427 --> 21:44.970
[phone ringing]

21:45.679 --> 21:49.558
[woman in Spanish]
Hello, Sheila. We invaded the room.

21:49.808 --> 21:50.851
[Glenda] Hello?

21:51.268 --> 21:52.853
[woman in Spanish]  Hi. How are you?

21:52.936 --> 21:54.229
[Glenda] Good and how are you?

21:54.354 --> 21:59.192
Good. Honestly, I'm gonna tell you...

21:59.276 --> 22:03.488
I'll tell you what they are talking about.
Please don't get your hopes up.

22:03.572 --> 22:07.159
- This whole thing is upsetting me.
-Okay.

22:07.242 --> 22:09.328
To be honest,

22:09.411 --> 22:12.706
a solution by this weekend 
would be a miracle

22:12.789 --> 22:14.791
because it's so last-minute.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.335
-Okay.
-Um...

22:18.420 --> 22:22.090
I think the city 
is trying to pressure people.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.217
Pressuring them
to go to homeless shelters.

22:24.301 --> 22:27.512
Since a lot of people don't want to go,
they'll instead go back to Puerto Rico.

22:28.847 --> 22:31.725
That's the strategy I'm seeing.

22:32.642 --> 22:33.727
Wow.

22:35.145 --> 22:36.813
[boy] So let's go to another hotel.

22:36.897 --> 22:40.359
[Glenda] To another hotel, but it's going
to be for people that are homeless.

22:40.567 --> 22:41.401
Wow.

22:41.485 --> 22:43.862
[woman in Spanish]
They have the resources to do something.

22:44.821 --> 22:50.285
The thing is that they want most of us 
to leave the country.

22:53.038 --> 22:56.583
We just have to keep living day by day
and wait.

22:56.666 --> 22:58.668
-[Glenda] Exactly.
-Strong together.

22:58.752 --> 23:01.338
[woman] Right. We can't break down 
because we went through worse

23:01.421 --> 23:02.631
in Puerto Rico.

23:02.714 --> 23:07.761
How long were we without water 
and electricity in Puerto Rico?

23:08.512 --> 23:12.224
-[Nilda] With no food.
-Here, we have water and electricity.

23:12.307 --> 23:15.310
Where will we be?
We don't know. We just have to wait.

23:16.186 --> 23:18.063
-[Kenia] God will provide.
-[Nilda] I wish I was you.

23:18.313 --> 23:19.606
Mm-hmm. Exactly.

23:20.941 --> 23:22.943
It's a slow process.

23:23.735 --> 23:25.195
One day at a time.

23:25.779 --> 23:28.657
-[Glenda] How many more days?
-Four.

23:29.116 --> 23:30.283
That's right.

23:35.664 --> 23:37.165
[food sizzling]

23:49.386 --> 23:51.138
[Kenia] We need ice.

23:57.853 --> 24:00.355
Nilda, can you get more ice?

24:04.734 --> 24:07.821
She gets stuck on the phone. 
I should take it away.

24:13.034 --> 24:15.454
I live alone here. No one listens to me.

24:19.958 --> 24:21.626
Nilda Lee, answer me.

24:26.506 --> 24:27.841
-Oh, Lord.
-What?

24:27.924 --> 24:31.303
There you are! [exclaiming]

24:31.386 --> 24:32.971
You're here! Great!

24:33.054 --> 24:35.307
I'm happy you're here!

24:35.390 --> 24:36.808
What time did you get here?

24:37.392 --> 24:39.853
-[chuckling]
-I was never gone.

24:40.395 --> 24:42.397
[Kenia murmurs softly]

24:51.031 --> 24:54.284
[Glenda]  What did you hear?
What did the doctor say?

24:54.367 --> 24:56.286
What did he notice about her?

24:56.369 --> 25:00.707
[Kenia]  The doctor noticed that
what she went through with the hurricane

25:00.790 --> 25:03.585
has affected her emotionally.

25:05.629 --> 25:08.965
That those memories aren't going to fade

25:09.049 --> 25:13.512
-until she has stability and security.
-[door unlocks, opens]

25:13.595 --> 25:16.097
-Yes. Hi, Nilda Lee.
-Uh-huh.

25:16.723 --> 25:18.975
Tell me how it went.

25:19.059 --> 25:20.852
Come here so I can talk to you.

25:21.645 --> 25:25.941
-How did it go? How was it?
-[Kenia speaks indistinctly]

25:26.024 --> 25:28.318
[Glenda] You tell me. How did it go?

25:28.401 --> 25:30.612
-Where?
-[Glenda] The psychologist's.

25:33.156 --> 25:35.659
-[laughs]
-I told him that I was in my house

25:35.742 --> 25:37.702
the day of the hurricane.

25:37.786 --> 25:42.123
I was young.
I thought it was coming to kill me.

25:44.709 --> 25:47.587
I also told him

25:47.671 --> 25:52.092
I've been clenching my fists.
I sometimes pull my hair.

25:52.926 --> 25:55.887
I hide in the bathroom.

25:55.971 --> 25:58.682
Sometimes I drive myself a little crazy.

25:59.099 --> 26:02.852
I have told you that I want to help you

26:02.936 --> 26:04.938
because you're like a daughter to me.

26:05.021 --> 26:08.275
Kenia is like a sister to me.

26:08.358 --> 26:11.152
I want to help you because when I see you

26:11.236 --> 26:14.656
acting like that, pulling your hair,
throwing your fists,

26:14.739 --> 26:18.785
or saying you're ugly
and that you have no friends--

26:18.868 --> 26:19.786
Try this instead...

26:19.869 --> 26:21.913
[Glenda takes deep breath, exhales slowly]

26:21.997 --> 26:26.418
Breathe, calm down, 
and go on about your day.

26:31.715 --> 26:33.341
See yourself as you really are.

26:43.476 --> 26:47.272
You are a very pretty girl
who is just starting to live.

26:48.189 --> 26:52.277
You have to say, "I am beautiful,
and I'm going to conquer the world."

26:56.364 --> 26:59.618
Keep pushing forward,
and you are going to find not just one,

26:59.701 --> 27:00.994
but millions of friends.

27:16.343 --> 27:20.722
[Glenda]  We have three days left,
and I'm in a bit of a panic.

27:21.389 --> 27:25.185
I don't know if we'll get the assistance

27:25.268 --> 27:29.522
we need to get a roof over our heads,
or if we'll be out on the street.

27:39.449 --> 27:41.826
The one thing I know
is that we'll be separated.

27:43.536 --> 27:45.038
We won't be together anymore.

27:45.872 --> 27:47.999
[Nilda squeals] No! Come here!

27:48.458 --> 27:49.542
No!

27:49.626 --> 27:52.003
[all]   Happy Birthday!

27:52.087 --> 27:54.631
It's from all of us! She's going to cry.

27:55.090 --> 27:57.092
Come on, Nilda Lee!

27:58.259 --> 27:59.678
This was not our idea.

27:59.761 --> 28:01.262
We had a different idea.

28:01.346 --> 28:03.765
[chatter continues, muted]

28:24.744 --> 28:28.331
[reporter 1]  Hurricane housing for
the victims of Hurricane Maria is over.

28:28.415 --> 28:32.127
As of today, most affected families
will lose their hotel and motel vouchers

28:32.210 --> 28:34.212
and have to find another place to live.

28:34.921 --> 28:35.964
[safe beeps]

28:44.723 --> 28:46.474
Do you want to take these to storage?

28:47.892 --> 28:48.768
Nilda?

28:50.228 --> 28:52.480
-How many bags do you need?
-[Kenia] About four.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.566
Four bags. The big ones.

28:56.985 --> 28:58.403
[woman] Discard everything.

29:03.241 --> 29:04.951
I want to give these to you

29:05.368 --> 29:06.911
because I have to move.

29:06.995 --> 29:08.580
-[woman] I'll take them.
-You will?

29:18.590 --> 29:20.175
-[sighs]
-[knocking at door]

29:22.260 --> 29:28.933
Calm down. This is a process. 
It's hard, but...

29:30.852 --> 29:32.228
we'll see each other soon.

29:32.771 --> 29:33.813
[sniffling]

29:38.401 --> 29:41.905
-[Sheila continues indistinctly]
-[soft weeping]

29:46.785 --> 29:48.119
[soft sobs]

29:58.338 --> 30:00.340
[overlapping nearby chatter]

30:08.765 --> 30:10.016
[woman in English] What's her name?

30:10.099 --> 30:12.101
-[in Spanish] My name is Sheila Moreno.
-Sheila.

30:12.185 --> 30:14.229
-[Shelia] My husband.
-[woman] Alvarez. It's him?

30:14.312 --> 30:16.272
[Sheila] Alvarez, my husband.
He's right there.

30:16.356 --> 30:17.190
Come here.

30:17.899 --> 30:18.900
[horn honking]

30:25.865 --> 30:28.660
[woman 1 in English] Ask them
what day did they arrive in New York City.

30:28.743 --> 30:30.745
[woman 2 in Spanish]
When did you arrive to the U.S.?

30:30.829 --> 30:33.414
-[Sheila in Spanish] December 24.
-[woman 2 in English] December 24.

30:33.498 --> 30:37.252
[Sheila] We came to the intake office,
and they told us that FEMA would help us.

30:37.794 --> 30:42.465
[woman 2 in Spanish]
Did FEMA cover your moving expenses?

30:42.549 --> 30:44.926
[Sheila] No, FEMA didn't cover 
our costs to move here.

30:45.426 --> 30:48.304
Those people aren't helping at all, Kenia.

30:48.388 --> 30:51.808
[Sheila] No, FEMA didn't cover
any travel fare money...

30:51.891 --> 30:55.436
They aren't doing anything.
They don't help with anything.

30:55.520 --> 30:58.439
[woman 1 in English] Do they understand
why they're being transferred?

30:58.523 --> 30:59.691
[woman 2] She says no.

30:59.774 --> 31:02.569
[woman 1] Okay. So tell her
the reason why she's being moved

31:02.652 --> 31:06.364
is because the government is not paying 
for her family to stay here anymore.

31:06.447 --> 31:07.824
For none of the families.

31:07.907 --> 31:11.077
So tell her
that she's going to go stay at a shelter.

31:11.160 --> 31:13.538
We don't know how long 
she's going to be there.

31:14.956 --> 31:16.374
[sniffling]

31:17.584 --> 31:18.877
[Kenia] What are they thinking?

31:18.960 --> 31:21.546
Are they going to just leave people
out on the streets?

31:21.629 --> 31:23.882
[woman in English]
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

31:25.550 --> 31:27.927
[Kenia]
These people don't have a place to stay.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.098
[woman 3] Glenda Martez?

31:36.144 --> 31:40.607
[woman 3 in Spanish] Do you have any
family you could stay with for a while?

31:40.690 --> 31:43.568
Try to think of where you can go.

31:43.651 --> 31:47.906
[Glenda] My son lives in Orlando
in a small room with my mom and dad.

31:48.531 --> 31:50.116
[crying] I can't go there.

31:52.535 --> 31:55.622
What about my husband's job?
Are they giving him a job in Orlando?

31:57.206 --> 31:59.292
[Sheila]
They haven't explained anything to her.

31:59.375 --> 32:00.376
Where are you going?

32:00.460 --> 32:03.504
She said, "You have family in Orlando?"
"My son is there."

32:03.588 --> 32:05.423
"Then go to Orlando." I can't.

32:05.506 --> 32:09.260
Christian lives in a studio.
He took in my mom and dad who are sick.

32:09.344 --> 32:12.597
[Sheila] Try to talk to them
when they finish with Kenia.

32:12.680 --> 32:14.682
They'll explain everything to you,

32:14.766 --> 32:17.852
but I have to leave now. Yes, I'll go.

32:18.269 --> 32:21.105
I need to go because otherwise...

32:21.189 --> 32:25.568
-It's okay--
-Remember that this is only today.

32:25.652 --> 32:28.947
Because she is saying 
that she will find you some help.

32:30.823 --> 32:36.496
Don't cry because that's what they want.
To destabilize us so that we take off.

32:36.579 --> 32:39.207
-And that's not the case, okay?
-Okay.

33:35.138 --> 33:36.973
[gulls calling]

33:53.614 --> 33:55.283
[indistinct conversation]

33:55.366 --> 33:57.869
Eh... [murmurs softly]

34:02.582 --> 34:04.584
-This is what's left.
-Yes, I know.

34:05.835 --> 34:06.878
Tranquilo.

34:07.795 --> 34:09.088
[brother] Nothing but dust.

34:10.673 --> 34:12.091
First Hurricane Maria...

34:13.051 --> 34:15.136
and then this ordeal.

34:20.349 --> 34:22.685
[Kenia] I miss him, like I miss Mom.

34:24.353 --> 34:25.938
[sighs, sniffles]

34:27.023 --> 34:29.317
I miss him looking after me 
and my daughter.

34:30.109 --> 34:31.277
[sobbing]

34:44.415 --> 34:46.417
I feel so lonely.

34:52.799 --> 34:54.592
[continues sobbing]

34:54.675 --> 34:56.677
[soft choral music plays]

35:02.517 --> 35:05.520
[Kenia]  It's not that they just died.
They let them die.

35:10.733 --> 35:12.735
And hurricane season is coming again.

35:56.320 --> 35:58.781
