[car doors shut]

00:07.570 --> 00:09.231
[woman sighs]

00:09.240 --> 00:12.232
Uh, well, uh, thank you
for dinner.

00:12.240 --> 00:13.605
Yeah. It was fun.

00:13.610 --> 00:15.578
Yeah.

00:16.410 --> 00:17.377
Ooh! Ok.

00:17.380 --> 00:18.870
Zack, zack. I'm sorry.

00:18.880 --> 00:20.609
Um, I just, um--

00:20.620 --> 00:22.440
I didn't feel
a connection.

00:22.450 --> 00:24.179
Thought we had
a great time.

00:24.190 --> 00:25.214
It was fun.

00:25.220 --> 00:31.455
Just, uh, no sparks
for me anyway.

00:31.460 --> 00:33.349
I'm really sorry.

00:33.360 --> 00:34.657
Well, how do you
know for sure?

00:34.660 --> 00:36.219
How about we
go inside

00:36.230 --> 00:37.391
And see what
happens, huh?

00:37.400 --> 00:38.890
I don't--
I don't think so.

00:38.900 --> 00:40.868
But it was really
great to meet you,

00:40.870 --> 00:44.261
And, um, you, uh--
you take care, ok?

00:44.270 --> 00:47.979
Seriously?
This is it?

00:47.980 --> 00:51.848
Yeah. Sorry.
Good night, zack.

00:56.480 --> 00:57.845
Woman: Leave a message.

00:57.850 --> 00:59.887
Hey, girl. It's me.

00:59.890 --> 01:02.313
You are officially
banned from ever

01:02.320 --> 01:03.515
Setting me up again.

01:03.530 --> 01:04.679
I'd rather do it online

01:04.690 --> 01:07.250
If that's the best
you can come up with.

01:07.260 --> 01:11.697
The guy was
a total loser.

01:11.700 --> 01:14.635
Call me back. Bye.

[smacks flashlight]

02:33.750 --> 02:36.412

02:36.420 --> 02:37.819
Lights out.

02:37.820 --> 02:40.790
[screaming]

02:49.730 --> 02:52.700
Ohh! What are
you doing?

02:52.700 --> 02:54.896
Aah!

02:57.970 --> 03:01.031
[whimpering]

03:03.280 --> 03:05.840
It's just the dark.

03:05.850 --> 03:09.013
Oh, oh! Aah!

03:12.920 --> 03:15.651
Where's the...

03:26.030 --> 03:30.968
Unh! Aah! Unh!

03:37.010 --> 03:38.808
No! No!

03:38.810 --> 03:43.816
Help me, please!
Help me!

03:53.390 --> 03:55.996
Beth: If you find yourself
alone with an attacker,

03:56.000 --> 03:57.991
Unfortunately if we're
being realistic,

03:58.000 --> 03:59.365
We're not as strong
as they are.

03:59.370 --> 04:00.360
So what we want to do

04:00.370 --> 04:01.690
Is we want to be able
to learn

04:01.700 --> 04:03.395
How to use
their movement,

04:03.410 --> 04:05.333
Their momentum,
and their body strength

04:05.340 --> 04:07.434
Against them.

04:14.220 --> 04:16.541
[cell phone rings]

04:16.550 --> 04:18.279
Yeah?

04:18.290 --> 04:20.678
I'm on my way.

04:20.690 --> 04:22.681
[beep beep]

04:42.340 --> 04:43.102
What do we got?

04:43.110 --> 04:44.669
Kristin patterson,
32, single,

04:44.680 --> 04:46.170
Lives alone,
attacked last night

04:46.180 --> 04:49.013
Came home to find all
her lights tampered with.

04:49.020 --> 04:51.239
Guy had night vision
goggles.

04:51.250 --> 04:52.149
No sexual assault?

04:52.150 --> 04:53.618
No. She told
the responding officer

04:53.620 --> 04:55.509
She thought she was
being stalked

04:55.520 --> 04:58.490
But never filed
a report.

05:00.360 --> 05:02.556
He put the hood
on my head

05:02.560 --> 05:04.528
And dragged me
down the hallway.

05:04.530 --> 05:07.067
I thought he was
gonna rape me

05:07.070 --> 05:08.890
And then kill me.

05:08.900 --> 05:10.698
I was terrified.

05:10.710 --> 05:12.200
The drapes were closed,

05:12.210 --> 05:13.439
And he'd moved
the furniture,

05:13.440 --> 05:16.569
So I was tripping
and falling all over the place.

05:16.580 --> 05:18.674
He rearranged
the furniture?

05:18.680 --> 05:22.571
_ I was lost
in My own house.

05:24.150 --> 05:25.982
It's ok.

05:25.990 --> 05:27.810
Please take your time.

05:27.820 --> 05:29.788
[sniffles]

05:29.790 --> 05:32.327
Um...

05:32.330 --> 05:34.424
He started taunting me,

05:34.430 --> 05:37.730
Saying it was just
the dark,

05:37.730 --> 05:39.721
But it was pitch black.

05:39.740 --> 05:40.889
I was so scared.

05:40.900 --> 05:43.392
I know it was dark,
but did anything

05:43.410 --> 05:45.560
Stand out?

05:45.570 --> 05:47.959
I saw a small red light.

05:47.980 --> 05:49.539
He was filming you.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.541
In your statement,
you said someone's

05:51.550 --> 05:52.847
Been stalking you.

05:52.850 --> 05:56.115
Uh, yes. Um, for the past
couple of months,

05:56.120 --> 05:59.988
I've sensed eyes on me.

05:59.990 --> 06:03.756
I thought I glimpsed
a man or a figure.

06:03.760 --> 06:05.785
I know that sounds,
crazy, but...

06:05.790 --> 06:07.326
Was it more like
intuition?

06:07.330 --> 06:09.492
Exactly, and I came
home one night,

06:09.500 --> 06:11.923
And my bathroom window
was open,

06:11.930 --> 06:14.262
And another time,
the front door was unlocked.

06:14.270 --> 06:15.829
Why didn't you
report it?

06:15.840 --> 06:17.467
Well, nothing was missing,

06:17.470 --> 06:19.199
But a few days ago,
I did notice

06:19.210 --> 06:21.508
My underwear drawer
was all messed up.

06:21.510 --> 06:23.569
The clothes had been,
moved rearranged.

06:23.580 --> 06:27.642
I tried to convince myself
it was the cleaning lady.

06:27.650 --> 06:30.620
Most victims are stalked
by people they know.

06:30.620 --> 06:32.748
Is there anyone
you can think of?

06:32.760 --> 06:36.219
I did have a date
last night.

06:36.230 --> 06:38.927
It didn't end well.

06:38.930 --> 06:40.079
What happened?

06:40.100 --> 06:43.092
He drove me home,
made a move,

06:43.100 --> 06:46.126
And I told him I didn't
feel a connection,

06:46.140 --> 06:48.632
But he tried to
come inside anyway.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.699
He was pretty peeved
about it.

06:50.710 --> 06:52.530
Name, please.

06:52.540 --> 06:53.462
Uh, zack thomas.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.369
From now on, you don't
let any strangers

06:55.380 --> 06:59.044
My friend set us.
He wasn't a total stranger.

06:59.050 --> 07:00.142
So you'd met him
before?

07:00.150 --> 07:02.539
Well, no,
but we know so many

07:02.550 --> 07:03.972
Of the same people.

07:03.990 --> 07:05.446
He'd seen me,

07:05.450 --> 07:07.441
And he really wanted
to go out.

07:07.460 --> 07:08.882
Seen you? Where?

07:08.890 --> 07:10.619
On my friend's
facebook page.

07:10.630 --> 07:13.019
She said he'd been
begging her to set us up

07:13.030 --> 07:16.455
For a while, that he
was really into me.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.723
Are you afraid
of the dark?

07:18.730 --> 07:20.562
Yes, I'm terrified.

07:20.570 --> 07:22.629
Is that
common knowledge?

07:22.640 --> 07:24.130
Well, I suppose so.

07:24.140 --> 07:26.234
I always have been. Why?

07:26.240 --> 07:29.540
Means your stalker
knows you.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.678
Zack thomas has a record
for drunk driving,

07:31.680 --> 07:33.569
Public intoxication,
and resisting arrest.

07:33.580 --> 07:35.070
Well, obviously, the
friend that set them up

07:35.080 --> 07:36.343
Didn't know
his history.

07:36.350 --> 07:38.216
Probably let it slip
that kristin's terrified

07:38.220 --> 07:40.416
"what she like?
Tell me all about her."

07:40.420 --> 07:41.910
He's m.I.A.
Didn't show up for work,

07:41.920 --> 07:42.910
No one's heard from him.

07:42.930 --> 07:44.352
Ben, put out an apb
and get a warrant

07:44.360 --> 07:45.555
To ping his
cell phone.

07:45.560 --> 07:46.584
I'll do it.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.523
No. I got it.

07:50.430 --> 07:53.070
So was he supposed
to get my job? Is that it?

07:53.070 --> 07:55.437
No. He's level one,
you're level two.

07:55.440 --> 07:56.532
He knows
the pecking order.

07:56.540 --> 07:58.030
He just doesn't
like it.

07:58.040 --> 07:59.337
Or me.

07:59.340 --> 08:00.262
Whose fault is that?

08:00.280 --> 08:03.136
Let's go check out
the crime scene.

08:19.590 --> 08:21.024
Jack: Any prints?

08:21.030 --> 08:22.191
No. He was careful

08:22.200 --> 08:25.830
Not to leave
anything behind.

08:25.830 --> 08:28.128
He bleached out
his semen.

08:29.100 --> 08:30.864
She escapes before
he can rape her,

08:30.870 --> 08:32.429
So he masturbates
instead?

08:32.440 --> 08:34.328
No. You don't hang out
to masturbate

08:34.340 --> 08:36.376
After your
victim escapes.

08:36.380 --> 08:37.870
It's too risky.

08:37.880 --> 08:40.850
He sat here while
he was filming her.

08:40.850 --> 08:42.716
He was getting off
on her fear.

08:42.720 --> 08:46.179
He let her go because he
already got what he needed.

08:46.190 --> 08:48.613
We have a sadistic
stalker who inflicts

08:48.620 --> 08:50.850
Psychological
violence to control

08:50.860 --> 08:52.385
His victims
with fear?

08:52.390 --> 08:55.189
His m.O. Isn't to Kill.

08:55.200 --> 08:57.089
It's to terrify.

08:57.100 --> 08:58.465
Think he hangs on
to the videos,

08:58.470 --> 09:00.598
Gets off
on them later?

09:00.600 --> 09:02.364
Maybe.

09:04.710 --> 09:07.270
She took off her shoes,

09:07.280 --> 09:08.600
Turns on the light,

09:08.610 --> 09:11.580
Walks past
the dark living room

09:11.580 --> 09:14.299
Into the bedroom.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.470
Clicks on the light.

09:16.490 --> 09:19.243
[snaps]

09:19.250 --> 09:22.288
All is good.

09:22.290 --> 09:28.081
While she showers, our
stalker tampers with her lights.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.660
She comes back
into the bedroom,

09:30.670 --> 09:33.230
Hits the switch,
nothing.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.163
She tries the lamps,
no bulbs,

09:35.170 --> 09:39.539
So she goes to grab
a flashlight.

09:39.540 --> 09:41.167
Let there be light.

09:41.180 --> 09:42.306
She thought
she was safe

09:42.310 --> 09:44.779
Until she saw the bulbs
and the batteries

09:44.780 --> 09:45.702
In the drawer.

09:45.710 --> 09:46.643
And when she got home,

09:46.650 --> 09:48.744
All the lights worked,
so he gave her

09:48.750 --> 09:50.673
A false sense
of security.

09:50.690 --> 09:52.089
Did his homework, too.

09:52.090 --> 09:53.740
House next door has
a for sale sign,

09:53.760 --> 09:55.512
Overgrown grass,
it's vacant.

09:55.520 --> 09:56.817
No one can hear
her screams.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.252
How does she know
her attacker?

09:58.260 --> 10:03.494
Is it a co-worker,
a friend, ex?

10:03.500 --> 10:05.161
What are you afraid of?
Sorry?

10:05.170 --> 10:07.525
What's the one most thing
you're afraid of,

10:07.540 --> 10:09.190
And who knows about it?

10:09.200 --> 10:10.361
What's your point?

10:10.370 --> 10:13.203
I don't know.
I'm just curious.

10:13.210 --> 10:14.029
Keep it that way.

10:14.040 --> 10:16.372
My point is
guarded people

10:16.380 --> 10:17.802
Keep things
to themselves.

10:17.810 --> 10:21.371
Very few people truly
get to know them.

10:21.380 --> 10:23.018
Does kristin strike you
as secretive,

10:23.020 --> 10:25.409
Or her personality
more forthcoming?

10:25.420 --> 10:29.254
Most people are guarded
about their fears and phobias,

10:29.260 --> 10:30.659
And stop fishing.
Yeah?

10:30.660 --> 10:33.152
Ben on cell phone: We have a
location for zack thomas' cell phone.

10:33.160 --> 10:35.822
It's in the vacant house
next door to the victim's.

10:35.830 --> 10:37.594
He's waiting for her
to come home.

10:37.600 --> 10:39.659
Backup is en route.

11:33.520 --> 11:35.579
[beep beep]

11:51.440 --> 11:52.305
Ohh!

11:52.310 --> 11:53.402
[zack coughing]

11:53.410 --> 11:54.639
You ok?
Yeah.

11:54.640 --> 11:55.869
Get an ambulance.

11:55.880 --> 11:58.804
[coughing]

12:03.020 --> 12:04.943
And after kristin
went inside,

12:04.950 --> 12:05.883
What happened?

12:05.890 --> 12:07.415
I heard something
from the side yard,

12:07.420 --> 12:08.785
So I went to
check it out.

12:08.790 --> 12:09.916
And you saw someone?

12:09.930 --> 12:11.489
I saw a guy
by the window.

12:11.490 --> 12:12.980
Did you see his face?

12:12.990 --> 12:15.300
No. It was dark,
and when he saw me,

12:15.300 --> 12:17.359
He ran behind the house,
so I went after him,

12:17.370 --> 12:19.668
But he attacked me
from behind.

12:19.670 --> 12:21.490
Poked me in the neck
with a needle.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.798
Did he say anything
to you?

12:23.810 --> 12:26.939
Yeah. That I wasn't
gonna ruin his night,

12:26.940 --> 12:28.169
And then I blacked out.

12:28.180 --> 12:29.807
Next thing I know,
I'm waking up

12:29.810 --> 12:30.971
In the trunk
of my own car.

12:30.980 --> 12:32.277
When you and Kristin
were at dinner,

12:32.280 --> 12:34.305
Did you notice anyone
staring at you guys,

12:34.320 --> 12:36.414
Anyone follow you
out to the valet?

12:36.420 --> 12:38.582
A lot of guys were
checking kristin out.

12:38.590 --> 12:39.682
She's a pretty girl,

12:39.690 --> 12:43.649
But no one--no one
really stood out.

12:43.660 --> 12:46.322
You think
of anything else,

12:46.330 --> 12:47.820
Call me.

12:47.830 --> 12:49.650
Thanks for your time.

12:49.660 --> 12:52.595
Is kristin ok?

12:52.600 --> 12:54.398
Yes.

12:54.400 --> 12:56.869
That's good.

12:56.870 --> 12:59.407
I hope you get him.

12:59.410 --> 13:01.139
We will.

13:03.510 --> 13:05.706
Our stalker attacks
zack and drugs him,

13:05.710 --> 13:07.508
Puts him in the trunk,
pulls his car

13:07.520 --> 13:08.749
Into the neighbor's
garage,

13:08.750 --> 13:09.820
Then attacks kristin.

13:09.820 --> 13:11.413
And left the keys exposed
so zack would be found.

13:11.420 --> 13:13.411
Janice: Zack was in his way.
He didn't want to kill him,

13:13.420 --> 13:14.683
But he was already
in a state of arousal,

13:14.690 --> 13:16.749
And he couldn't let
zack ruin his plans

13:16.760 --> 13:17.579
With kristin.

13:17.590 --> 13:18.887
We've spoken to all
their friends

13:18.890 --> 13:19.880
And family
available.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.425
No one knows or fits
who we're looking for.

13:21.430 --> 13:22.955
We should speak to
our victim kristin again,

13:22.960 --> 13:24.394
See if she can point us
in a new direction

13:24.400 --> 13:25.993
And let her know her
stalker's still out there.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.264
Ben: I get it. As a kid, I
was always afraid of the dark.

13:28.270 --> 13:29.340
I still am.
What happened

13:29.340 --> 13:30.637
To that girl
would freak me out.

13:30.640 --> 13:32.699
You're afraid of
the dark? Oh, yeah.

13:32.710 --> 13:35.736
The lights are on
at my place.

13:42.980 --> 13:45.244
Well, market fluctuations
are caused

13:45.250 --> 13:46.240
By a number of things.

13:46.250 --> 13:49.584
That's why I've been
analyzing the data.

13:53.130 --> 13:56.998
Well, I ran the numbers
on your private equity fund.

13:57.000 --> 14:03.030
Just doesn't make sense to where
your portfolio's performing.

14:03.040 --> 14:05.532
Uh-huh.

14:05.540 --> 14:08.976
I just think we need
to keep looking.

14:09.940 --> 14:11.578
Zack almost died
because of me.

14:11.580 --> 14:13.207
It could have turned out
worst, trust me, I know.

14:13.220 --> 14:15.439
I'm a good person.
I'm a teacher.

14:15.450 --> 14:16.645
I make a difference.

14:16.650 --> 14:17.811
Why is this
happening to me?

14:17.820 --> 14:19.640
Well, we're trying
to figure it out,

14:19.650 --> 14:20.720
But we need
your help.

14:20.720 --> 14:24.179
Is there anyone else
you can think of?

14:24.190 --> 14:26.420
What grade you teach?

14:26.430 --> 14:27.124
Fourth.

14:27.130 --> 14:28.222
So you spend a lot
of time

14:28.230 --> 14:29.550
With your students,
right?

14:29.560 --> 14:31.449
Uh, yeah. Almost
6 hours a day.

14:31.470 --> 14:34.326
So you're a role model
by default.

14:34.340 --> 14:35.694
That must be
stressful.

14:35.700 --> 14:36.997
What does my job
got to do with this?

14:37.010 --> 14:38.432
Your reputation
at school is

14:38.440 --> 14:42.206
And that's why you're not
telling us the truth.

14:42.210 --> 14:44.474
Ok. I have no idea
what you're talking about.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.778
You're squirming in your chair
because you're uncomfortable

14:46.780 --> 14:47.850
With my questions.

14:47.850 --> 14:48.976
Your arms are folded.

14:48.980 --> 14:52.189
You're protecting
yourself from something.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.188
You're not the role model
those kids think you are,

15:00.200 --> 15:01.554
Are you?

15:01.560 --> 15:03.028
Beth: Shame is powerful.
I get it,

15:03.030 --> 15:05.055
But if you're not
honest with us,

15:05.070 --> 15:08.096
More people are
going to get hurt.

15:10.800 --> 15:13.531
I'm around children
all day long,

15:13.540 --> 15:17.738
And it's really hard to
meet a nice guy in LA,

15:17.750 --> 15:21.072
I got lonely,
and I signed on

15:21.080 --> 15:22.741
To a dating
web site.

15:22.750 --> 15:25.014
Which one?

15:25.020 --> 15:27.182
Norulesdating.Com.

15:27.190 --> 15:28.510
It's not exactly
dating.

15:28.520 --> 15:31.285
It's more
casual sex.

15:31.290 --> 15:34.988
No. I went on some bad
dates, met some weirdoes,

15:35.000 --> 15:36.991
So I shut down
my account.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.024
How long ago?

15:38.030 --> 15:38.997
A couple of months.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.038
Around the time you
started being stalked?

15:42.040 --> 15:44.134
Ok. I'm gonna need
your account number

15:44.140 --> 15:45.505
And the names
of those bad dates.

15:45.510 --> 15:48.138
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you earlier.

15:48.140 --> 15:49.574
I...

15:49.580 --> 15:50.672
I was embarrassed.

15:50.680 --> 15:53.672
You were lonely.
You made a mistake.

15:53.680 --> 15:55.842
Learn from that.

15:55.850 --> 15:57.545
Beth: Her profile
name's bad teacher.

15:57.550 --> 16:00.019
Where were teachers like
that when I was in school?

16:00.020 --> 16:01.579
Dude, you did not
just say that.

16:01.590 --> 16:02.887
It's called having
a sense of humor.

16:02.890 --> 16:04.210
You should try it
sometime.

16:04.230 --> 16:05.755
I've narrowed it down
to 3 suspects.

16:05.760 --> 16:07.250
She had a one-night stand
with this guy,

16:07.260 --> 16:09.354
Then didn't respond
to his follow-up messages

16:09.360 --> 16:10.521
For another booty call.

16:10.530 --> 16:11.452
How many
did he send?

16:11.470 --> 16:13.598
30. She had a threesome
with this guy.

16:13.600 --> 16:15.329
Afterwards, he sent
her hate messages

16:15.340 --> 16:17.468
About getting left out
on the action.

16:17.470 --> 16:19.438
Guy looks like
a whack job.

16:19.440 --> 16:20.510
She met this guy
at a hotel

16:20.510 --> 16:22.137
But bailed on him
because was into bondage.

16:22.140 --> 16:23.778
He sent her some
threatening messages,

16:23.780 --> 16:25.009
And she blocked him
from her account.

16:25.010 --> 16:26.808
Bondage fits the
sadistic profile.

16:26.820 --> 16:28.049
Yeah. I ran
all their names,

16:28.050 --> 16:30.041
But none of them came up
in our arrest records.

16:30.050 --> 16:31.142
All right.
Keep digging.

16:31.150 --> 16:33.187
Call me if you
get something.

16:33.190 --> 16:35.887
I'll call beth.

16:35.890 --> 16:37.358
[music playing]

16:37.360 --> 16:38.509
Tracy: His name
is brody,

16:38.530 --> 16:41.522
And he's
a struggling artist.

16:41.530 --> 16:43.726
Mixed media, very
avant garde, so he says,

16:43.730 --> 16:45.562
But I haven't
seen anything.

16:45.570 --> 16:49.564
He's so cute
and sexy

16:49.570 --> 16:52.335
And young and...

16:52.340 --> 16:53.660
How young?

16:53.680 --> 16:55.307
22. Don't judge.

16:55.310 --> 16:56.300
Oh, my gosh.

16:56.310 --> 17:00.474
Well, I can't because
it's my fault.

17:00.480 --> 17:01.402
It is your fault.

17:01.420 --> 17:02.410
You told me
to have fun,

17:02.420 --> 17:04.616
And so I'm having
fun, lots of fun.

17:04.619 --> 17:07.442
Seriously though,
it's gonna sound weird,

17:07.460 --> 17:08.858
But there's a freedom
to this guy.

17:08.859 --> 17:12.523
You know, it's casual
and chilled.

17:12.530 --> 17:13.759
There's no heaviness,

17:13.760 --> 17:15.648
And just after what
I've been through--

17:15.660 --> 17:16.991
What we've both
been through--

17:17.000 --> 17:19.320
It's just nice to
feel something light.

17:19.329 --> 17:21.059
Hmm.

17:22.339 --> 17:24.694
How is he in bed?

17:24.710 --> 17:26.269
[mumbling]
I don't know.

17:26.270 --> 17:28.830
You just failed
your polygraph.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.775
It's definitely
a selling point.

17:31.780 --> 17:33.077
Sounds nice.

17:33.080 --> 17:34.741
Then you should
give it a go.

17:34.750 --> 17:35.774
We both deserve this.

17:35.780 --> 17:37.839
You deserve
to have more.

17:37.850 --> 17:40.820
Of course,
and I will one day,

17:40.820 --> 17:42.185
And yes,
I'm deflecting

17:42.190 --> 17:45.581
Because I don't want to
talk about it

17:45.590 --> 17:49.458
And because tonight
is about you

17:49.460 --> 17:53.067
And your
cradle-robbing ways.

17:53.070 --> 17:54.367
Cheers to that.

17:54.370 --> 17:56.065
Cheers.

17:57.200 --> 18:00.261
Woman: You should see these
guys I got matched up with.

18:00.280 --> 18:02.430
It will really make
you look in the mirror.

18:02.440 --> 18:05.000
Different woman: What
about that guy in san diego?

18:05.010 --> 18:07.240
[clatter]

18:07.250 --> 18:09.218
The tennis coach?
I don't know.

18:09.220 --> 18:11.518
Something about that
just disturbs me.

18:11.520 --> 18:13.386
Ok. You're weird.

18:13.390 --> 18:15.813
That was apparent
years ago.

18:15.820 --> 18:19.029
[thud]

18:19.030 --> 18:22.159
What is it?

18:22.160 --> 18:25.027
Laura?

18:25.030 --> 18:26.623
What's happening?

18:26.630 --> 18:28.792
Nothing. Heh.

18:28.800 --> 18:32.600
Maybe it was just
a truck outside.

18:32.610 --> 18:34.305
[hiss]

18:34.310 --> 18:36.677
No. The point is,
why san diego?

18:36.680 --> 18:38.876
I mean, why can't
I meet someone here?

18:38.880 --> 18:41.042
I'm not whining
about this tonight.

18:41.050 --> 18:42.449
I'll talk to you
manana.

18:42.450 --> 18:45.010
Ok. Talk
to you later. Bye.

19:11.280 --> 19:13.169
[yawns]

19:24.890 --> 19:27.552
No! Oh, my god!

19:27.560 --> 19:30.689
No, no.

19:30.700 --> 19:32.623
Oh, god!

19:32.630 --> 19:34.428
Oh, my god.

19:34.440 --> 19:35.532
No!

19:35.540 --> 19:37.395
[whimpering]

19:37.410 --> 19:40.368
[screaming]

19:41.810 --> 19:44.507
Oh, my god! Aah!

19:44.510 --> 19:46.205
Oh, my god!

19:52.050 --> 19:53.188
[sirens]

19:53.190 --> 19:56.080
[helicopter flying]

19:56.090 --> 19:58.889
[police radio chatter]

20:05.470 --> 20:07.461
You interview
the victim?

20:07.470 --> 20:08.619
No. She's still
pretty upset.

20:08.640 --> 20:11.029
Medics are stabilizing
her blood pressure.

20:11.040 --> 20:13.259
No, and the guy
from animal control said

20:13.270 --> 20:14.567
They weren't venomous.

20:14.580 --> 20:15.638
How many snakes
were there?

20:15.640 --> 20:16.778
32 so far.
We found a pillow case.

20:16.780 --> 20:18.737
That's how he carried
them in.

20:18.750 --> 20:20.445
Same m.O. As
the first attack--

20:20.450 --> 20:21.474
Terrify, not Kill.

20:21.480 --> 20:23.016
That woman was so
scared, she passed out.

20:23.020 --> 20:24.272
She didn't even
see a face.

20:24.290 --> 20:27.248
He came prepared. S.I.D.
Found traces of bleach.

20:27.260 --> 20:31.458
He scrubbed out
another dna deposit.

20:31.460 --> 20:32.780
He made entry
through the window?

20:32.790 --> 20:34.189
And exit.
We found

20:34.200 --> 20:35.690
A grease stain
on the windowsill.

20:35.700 --> 20:36.826
He's getting sloppy.

20:36.830 --> 20:39.822
Maybe, but he's been
watching her for a while.

20:39.830 --> 20:42.936
He knew
her exact routine,

20:42.940 --> 20:46.069
Time she went to
sleep, everything.

20:46.070 --> 20:48.767
A sadistic serial stalker.

20:48.780 --> 20:49.770
Bad combo.

20:49.780 --> 20:51.236
He's going to be
outdoing himself

20:51.250 --> 20:52.672
From one victim
to the next

20:52.680 --> 20:53.602
For a bigger thrill.

20:53.620 --> 20:54.701
This level
of terror stalking

20:54.720 --> 20:57.314
_ Is more in line
with the acceleration process

20:57.320 --> 20:58.640
Of a serial killer.

20:58.650 --> 21:00.618
He satiates his fixation
with one victim,

21:00.620 --> 21:02.759
The moves on
to a new obsession.

21:02.760 --> 21:04.649
Each attack was
premeditated,

21:04.660 --> 21:08.722
He probably has his
next victim all picked out.

21:08.730 --> 21:12.428
He knows exactly what
he's gonna do to her.

21:15.340 --> 21:16.466
Beth: Miss fleming.

21:16.470 --> 21:19.201
I'm lieutenant
beth davis.

21:19.210 --> 21:20.507
Can we talk?

21:20.510 --> 21:23.036
Why didn't you guys
help me before?

21:23.040 --> 21:25.839
I filed a report
with a cop a couple weeks ago.

21:25.850 --> 21:28.649
I know you did. Strange
man was following you.

21:28.650 --> 21:30.470
He broke into my house.

21:30.490 --> 21:33.118
Nothing was missing
but moved around.

21:33.120 --> 21:34.940
The officer who took
that report thought

21:34.960 --> 21:35.916
It was just a break-in,

21:35.920 --> 21:37.558
So the threat wasn't
assessed properly.

21:37.560 --> 21:39.585
Yeah. Well, if someone would
have helped me in the first place,

21:39.590 --> 21:41.251
I wouldn't be
sitting here right now.

21:41.260 --> 21:42.921
You're right.
I am so sorry

21:42.930 --> 21:44.125
This happened
to you,

21:44.130 --> 21:46.895
And I'd be scared
and mad, too,

21:46.900 --> 21:50.461
But I'm here
to make it right.

21:50.470 --> 21:53.701
Did you see a face?

21:53.710 --> 21:54.802
No.

21:54.810 --> 21:57.074
Can you tell me
what happened?

21:57.080 --> 21:59.674
I had just started
to fall asleep.

21:59.680 --> 22:03.344
I felt something
under the covers.

22:03.350 --> 22:05.409
It was a snake.
I freaked.

22:05.420 --> 22:06.581
I fell out of my bed.

22:06.590 --> 22:08.479
There were snakes
all over.

22:08.490 --> 22:10.754
It was awful,

22:10.760 --> 22:15.152
And then I saw him
filming me.

22:15.160 --> 22:17.720
The camera was
in front of his face.

22:17.730 --> 22:20.324
Do you know who
it could have been?

22:20.340 --> 22:21.626
I don't know.

22:21.640 --> 22:25.167
Whoever it was knew that
I was afraid of snakes.

22:25.170 --> 22:26.808
You're his
second victim.

22:26.810 --> 22:28.266
The other girl
looked like you.

22:28.280 --> 22:30.806
He surprised her
in her home, too.

22:30.810 --> 22:34.576
We think that she met him
on a site-- norulesdating.

22:34.580 --> 22:36.014
Are you
on that, too?

22:36.020 --> 22:38.910
I'm on
twosoulsconnect.Com.

22:38.920 --> 22:42.652
Ok. I'm gonna need
your account info.

22:42.660 --> 22:45.357
What if he comes back?

22:45.360 --> 22:48.728
We don't think
that he will.

22:48.730 --> 22:51.620
He got what
he needed from you.

22:52.430 --> 22:54.865
Janice: Forensics report
says the stain on the windowsill

22:54.870 --> 22:56.065
Was motorcycle chain grease.

22:56.070 --> 22:58.596
Our guy has a bike
or maybe works on them.

22:58.610 --> 23:00.260
I cross-referenced
both victim's accounts,

23:00.270 --> 23:02.034
And neither of them
are receiving e-mails

23:02.040 --> 23:03.132
On the same
ip address.

23:03.140 --> 23:04.232
The women look alike,

23:04.250 --> 23:05.536
But they have
different phobias.

23:05.550 --> 23:07.040
Laura's phobia was
posted in her profile,

23:07.050 --> 23:09.519
And kristin chatted
about her fear of the dark

23:09.520 --> 23:11.318
With some guys
online.

23:11.320 --> 23:13.880
It's all about
spiders for me.

23:13.890 --> 23:15.289
Buried alive.

23:15.290 --> 23:16.360
And clowns.

23:16.360 --> 23:17.088
Obvious.

23:17.090 --> 23:19.684
Buried alive is
original?

23:19.690 --> 23:22.352
Beth: There has to be
some twisted reason

23:22.360 --> 23:23.691
Why he's targeting blonds

23:23.700 --> 23:25.498
And getting off
on their fear.

23:25.500 --> 23:27.161
Rejection could have
triggered his need

23:27.170 --> 23:28.524
For power over them.

23:28.540 --> 23:30.338
Let's cross-reference
their reject lists,

23:30.340 --> 23:33.207
See who they didn't
go out with.

23:46.650 --> 23:49.483
That was amazing.

23:49.490 --> 23:51.686
Yeah. Very.

23:51.690 --> 23:54.079
Really, really
amazing,

23:54.100 --> 23:56.319
But I have to go
into the restaurant.

23:56.330 --> 23:58.651
Phew.

23:58.670 --> 24:00.069
You feeling bad?

24:00.070 --> 24:04.564
Bad? No.
I feel great...

24:05.470 --> 24:06.960
Naughty...

24:06.970 --> 24:10.838
And really guilty
for blowing off work.

24:10.850 --> 24:13.478
That I understand.

24:13.480 --> 24:15.403
[exhales]

24:23.620 --> 24:25.714
Ok. Explain.

24:25.730 --> 24:26.959
Who's this guy?

24:26.960 --> 24:28.951
That's mickey,
my brother.

24:28.960 --> 24:32.590
Total brat growing up,
but we like him now.

24:32.600 --> 24:34.864
And, uh, the woman?

24:34.870 --> 24:37.999
That's beth,
friend of mine.

24:38.010 --> 24:39.830
She looks nice.

24:39.840 --> 24:42.229
She is
and a good friend.

24:42.240 --> 24:43.378
How long you
known her?

24:43.380 --> 24:45.940
Met her when I first
moved to [.A.

24:45.950 --> 24:48.999
She helped me
out of a jam.

24:49.020 --> 24:50.749
What kind of jam?

24:50.750 --> 24:52.240
You are SO nosy.

24:52.250 --> 24:56.050
You don't get to
know all my secrets.

24:56.060 --> 24:57.209
Really?

24:57.230 --> 24:59.255
Yaah!

24:59.260 --> 25:00.887
Ha!

25:00.900 --> 25:03.824
Now you have to
tell me.

25:05.030 --> 25:09.399
I had a little trouble
with a guy I was seeing.

25:09.400 --> 25:11.459
Boyfriend?

25:11.470 --> 25:12.938
Fiancee.

25:12.940 --> 25:14.169
We were supposed
to get married,

25:14.180 --> 25:15.909
And something didn't
feel right about him,

25:15.910 --> 25:17.503
So I broke it off,

25:17.510 --> 25:21.299
And he couldn't
handle the rejection.

25:21.320 --> 25:23.209
He went a little crazy.

25:23.220 --> 25:25.712
What'd he do?

25:25.720 --> 25:28.382
Tried to kill me.

25:28.390 --> 25:30.813
You serious?

25:30.830 --> 25:32.389
Yes, but he didn't,

25:32.390 --> 25:36.520
Thanks to one
badass cop.

25:36.530 --> 25:38.726
Where is he now?

25:38.730 --> 25:40.220
She sent him away.

25:40.230 --> 25:43.336
We've been best friends
ever since.

25:44.910 --> 25:47.129
I like her already.

25:48.480 --> 25:50.209
She'd been through
something similar,

25:50.210 --> 25:51.632
Actually a lot worse
than me.

25:51.650 --> 25:54.244
She's helped a lot.

25:54.250 --> 25:57.948
She still does,
her friendship.

25:57.950 --> 26:00.248
She sounds special.

26:00.250 --> 26:01.911
Very.

26:10.830 --> 26:12.821
I cross-referenced
the victims' reject lists.

26:12.830 --> 26:14.525
There was a linguistics
commonality

26:14.540 --> 26:16.634
In the e-mails sent
from this guy.

26:16.640 --> 26:17.960
Both women rejected him

26:17.970 --> 26:19.199
When he asked them out
on dates.

26:19.210 --> 26:20.769
Chris powell?
How'd you find him.

26:20.780 --> 26:23.135
Ben: His e-mails were sent
from public libraries.

26:23.140 --> 26:25.177
Alpr database has
images of him leaving

26:25.180 --> 26:26.909
The libraries
on a motorcycle.

26:26.910 --> 26:28.742
No license plate,
but the dealership name

26:28.750 --> 26:29.945
Was on the plate frame.

26:29.950 --> 26:31.076
His bike was
a special order.

26:31.090 --> 26:32.842
They faxed over a copy
of his driver's license.

26:32.850 --> 26:33.840
What's his story?

26:33.850 --> 26:35.181
4 years ago,
he was arrested for rape,

26:35.190 --> 26:37.215
But the d.A.
Didn't file.

26:37.220 --> 26:38.415
Victim?

26:38.430 --> 26:39.886
Ben: Meghan stewart,
blond pretty

26:39.890 --> 26:41.085
Just like
the other girls.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.659
It's possible she's
the genesis victim,

26:42.660 --> 26:44.389
The one who started
it all.

26:44.400 --> 26:45.629
Get a ramey warrant
for his arrest

26:45.630 --> 26:47.098
And send units
to his address.

26:47.100 --> 26:49.694
Is he registered
on any other dating sites?

26:49.700 --> 26:52.260
Yeah, but he's using
a different alias

26:52.270 --> 26:53.431
On each site.

26:53.440 --> 26:55.363
They're all taken
from different angles.

26:55.380 --> 26:56.632
Hard to tell if it's
the same guy.

26:56.640 --> 26:58.529
It is. Fbi did us
a favor and ran

26:58.550 --> 27:00.143
Their facial recognition
software.

27:00.150 --> 27:02.300
These women have no
idea they're being hunted.

27:02.320 --> 27:03.549
Like I said,
he escalating.

27:03.550 --> 27:07.180
We need to get to the
next victim before he does.

27:09.290 --> 27:11.213
[sighs]

27:11.960 --> 27:14.452
I've got to
come clean.

27:14.460 --> 27:17.691
My name's not brad.

27:17.700 --> 27:20.761
It's chris,

27:20.770 --> 27:24.764
And your profile pic
doesn't do you justice.

27:24.770 --> 27:27.705
[sobbing]

27:50.530 --> 27:52.350
Chris powell's home
was vacant

27:52.370 --> 27:55.795
We put out an apb in
case he tries to skip town.

27:55.800 --> 27:56.938
He won't leave
the city.

27:56.940 --> 27:58.237
It's where his
obsession

27:58.240 --> 27:59.867
With the genesis
victim started.

27:59.870 --> 28:01.008
We did some digging.

28:01.010 --> 28:02.535
After the assault,
the gv legally changed

28:02.540 --> 28:03.803
Her name to angela darrow.

28:03.810 --> 28:05.369
She's hiding out.
She's scared of him.

28:05.380 --> 28:07.599
She's local. Lives in
some highrise downtown.

28:07.620 --> 28:11.011
The genesis victim is
like a drug to his psyche.

28:11.020 --> 28:13.079
We have to talk to her.

28:15.090 --> 28:17.388
[knock on door]

28:17.390 --> 28:20.451
Police.

28:20.460 --> 28:23.020
Badge and I.D., please.

28:23.030 --> 28:26.796
Lieutenant beth davis,
detective jack larsen.

28:26.800 --> 28:30.794
[lock clicks]

28:30.810 --> 28:32.665
Miss darrow?

28:33.610 --> 28:37.979
We need to talk to you
about chris powell.

28:51.420 --> 28:54.424
He could have
followed you here.

28:54.430 --> 28:57.798
He's been terrorizing
other women.

29:00.730 --> 29:02.391
He's a sick person.

29:02.400 --> 29:05.791
Can you tell us
about your relationship?

29:06.540 --> 29:09.339
It's hard for me
to talk about.

29:09.340 --> 29:12.970
I know, but other women
are being attacked,

29:12.980 --> 29:15.972
And we really
need your help.

29:18.420 --> 29:21.845
Please.

29:21.860 --> 29:25.251
I started dating
chris 5 years ago.

29:25.260 --> 29:27.581
He kept pressuring
me to have sex,

29:27.600 --> 29:32.595
But I was a virgin
and scared.

29:32.600 --> 29:35.570
A neighbor molested
me when I was a kid.

29:35.570 --> 29:38.335
Doctors called it
genophobia.

29:38.340 --> 29:42.265
Chris didn't get it, so
I broke up with him.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.669
After that,
he became obsessed.

29:44.680 --> 29:47.570
He started
stalking you?

29:47.580 --> 29:49.241
Broke into my house,

29:49.250 --> 29:51.810
Threatened new guys
I was dating,

29:51.820 --> 29:54.118
And then one night,
he kidnapped me.

29:54.120 --> 29:55.349
Where'd he take you.

29:55.360 --> 29:57.613
To some abandoned
office building

29:57.630 --> 29:59.849
His dad owned.

30:01.660 --> 30:03.958
He raped me.

30:05.370 --> 30:09.295
No one could
hear me scream.

30:09.300 --> 30:15.034
Bastard said he was doing it
to help me conquer my fear.

30:15.040 --> 30:17.008
I had him arrested,

30:17.010 --> 30:19.138
But he had a lot
of family money,

30:19.150 --> 30:21.278
He hired
a fancy lawyer

30:21.280 --> 30:26.241
Who knew all
the loopholes.

30:26.250 --> 30:27.513
He walked.

30:27.520 --> 30:30.558
I was terrified he was
gonna hurt me again,

30:30.560 --> 30:33.086
So I quit my job,

30:33.090 --> 30:37.027
Changed my name,
dyed my hair, and moved.

30:37.030 --> 30:39.522
When was the last time
you had contact with him?

30:39.530 --> 30:42.192
He found me
4 months ago.

30:42.200 --> 30:44.635
I came home
and found dead roses

30:44.640 --> 30:47.439
- In a vase
in My bedroom.

30:47.440 --> 30:48.965
He's scared
of heights,

30:48.980 --> 30:51.278
So I moved
into this highrise.

30:51.280 --> 30:53.078
I feel safer
up here.

30:53.080 --> 30:58.416
Angela, I know you feel
the system let you down.

30:58.420 --> 31:04.689
If you help me, maybe
we can make this right.

31:04.690 --> 31:07.557
I might know
where he is.

31:07.560 --> 31:09.528
He finally finds her,
and she disappears

31:09.530 --> 31:12.397
Into her tower, which
triggers the other attacks.

31:12.400 --> 31:14.892
He could have her, so
he went after other women.

31:14.900 --> 31:16.436
His sick mind was helping
angela conquer her fear

31:16.440 --> 31:18.238
By raping her, but
with the new victims,

31:18.240 --> 31:19.730
It's about exposing them
to their fears

31:19.740 --> 31:22.505
So he can re-create the high
he felt when he raped angela.

31:22.510 --> 31:24.672
She's the genesis victim,
his first.

31:24.680 --> 31:26.774
She'll always be
special.

31:26.780 --> 31:28.976
I think he's still at
that abandoned building,

31:28.980 --> 31:30.175
Reliving it
over and over again.

31:30.180 --> 31:32.717
Angela thinks so, and
I'm inclined to believe her.

31:32.720 --> 31:36.953
Call ben. See if the address
is in the old case file.

32:19.700 --> 32:21.464
A third victim?

32:21.470 --> 32:23.268
Fear of drowning.

32:23.270 --> 32:25.637
He weighted her down.

32:33.510 --> 32:36.719
This one's a live feed.

32:36.720 --> 32:38.779
We have to find
her location.

32:38.790 --> 32:40.815
See the padding
on the walls?

32:40.820 --> 32:41.912
He soundproofed
the room.

32:41.920 --> 32:43.285
So no one could
hear her scream.

32:43.290 --> 32:45.452
Coffee's warm.
Here's here.

32:45.460 --> 32:47.883
We need to lock down
the building now.

32:57.200 --> 32:59.191
You're welcome.

33:03.340 --> 33:05.229
Any luck on our last
victim's location?

33:05.250 --> 33:06.502
I can't get
a trace on it.

33:06.510 --> 33:08.308
He uploaded the feed to bounce
through a bunch of servers.

33:08.320 --> 33:09.674
Right now, it's
in bosnia.

33:09.680 --> 33:10.772
Eventually,
I'll get it,

33:10.780 --> 33:12.009
But we don't have
enough time.

33:12.020 --> 33:13.283
Well, how much time
do we have.

33:13.290 --> 33:14.485
I'm looking
at the footage.

33:14.490 --> 33:15.810
The water's up
to her chin.

33:15.820 --> 33:17.379
Based on the seconds
per drip of the faucet,

33:17.390 --> 33:18.983
We've got
about 45 minutes.

33:18.990 --> 33:22.483
Well, then he'll have to
tell us where she is.

33:29.600 --> 33:30.738
Something wrong,
lieutenant?

33:30.740 --> 33:32.469
I've got you on breaking
and entering,

33:32.470 --> 33:34.700
Assault with a deadly
weapon on a police officer,

33:34.710 --> 33:36.439
And attempted murder on
that guy you strangled.

33:36.440 --> 33:38.704
We're talking life
in prison, no parole.

33:38.710 --> 33:41.748
On top of that,
she'll never make it.

33:41.750 --> 33:43.946
That water is dripping
from that faucet

33:43.950 --> 33:45.839
In half-ounce drops.

33:45.850 --> 33:49.684
In 45 minutes,
she's gone.

33:49.690 --> 33:51.954
Where is she?

33:54.890 --> 33:59.555
The first stage
of drowning is delicious.

33:59.570 --> 34:02.221
She understands
the danger and panics.

34:02.240 --> 34:04.334
She's frightened.

34:04.340 --> 34:08.129
Her pulse spikes,
and her pupils dilate.

34:08.139 --> 34:11.838
The water rises
and slaps her in the face.

34:11.850 --> 34:13.272
It trickles
into her mouth.

34:13.280 --> 34:15.100
She chokes on it

34:15.120 --> 34:17.077
And swallows.

34:17.080 --> 34:19.071
Let's take
a little walk.

34:19.090 --> 34:20.148
Uh-oh.

34:20.150 --> 34:24.313
We tried it your way.
Now it's my turn.

34:26.630 --> 34:29.349
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

34:29.360 --> 34:31.328
Stop! No!

34:31.330 --> 34:33.297
Come on.

34:33.300 --> 34:34.495
Ohh! Aah!

34:34.500 --> 34:35.422
No!

34:35.440 --> 34:38.364
No! Please!

34:38.370 --> 34:41.806
Ohh! Ohh! Please.
Please stop!

34:41.810 --> 34:45.474
I'll just tell everyone you
were despondent and jumped.

34:45.480 --> 34:46.947
Works every time.

34:46.949 --> 34:49.271
Sucks being scared,
don't it?

34:49.280 --> 34:53.114
Where is she?
Where is she?

34:53.120 --> 34:54.518
Where is she?!

34:54.520 --> 34:58.889
She's at
302 alien avenue.

34:58.890 --> 35:01.825
[coughing]

35:18.210 --> 35:20.269
Ben: Get her.
Go fast.

35:20.280 --> 35:22.146
There you go.

35:22.150 --> 35:24.118
Lightly, lightly,
lightly.

35:26.520 --> 35:28.511
No pulse.

35:28.520 --> 35:30.352
Come on.

35:35.060 --> 35:37.051
Come on.

35:37.060 --> 35:39.256
Yeah. Ok. Yeah.

35:39.270 --> 35:42.524
[coughing]

35:42.540 --> 35:44.736
It's ok. You're ok.

35:44.740 --> 35:47.664
[sobbing]

35:58.120 --> 36:00.487
[knock knock]

36:00.490 --> 36:02.219
Team drinks?

36:02.220 --> 36:04.609
No, thanks. I can't.

36:04.630 --> 36:06.416
Phobia of fun,

36:06.430 --> 36:07.989
Fear of letting
your co-workers see you

36:08.000 --> 36:10.992
After a couple of shots
of tequila?

36:11.000 --> 36:13.219
That's not it.

36:13.230 --> 36:15.426
Then what is it?

36:15.440 --> 36:17.397
What are you
afraid of?

36:17.400 --> 36:18.936
You first,
tough guy.

36:18.940 --> 36:21.432
Yeah. You keep
prying. My turn.

36:21.440 --> 36:23.135
What are you
afraid of?

36:23.140 --> 36:27.441
Oh, you want to
get real?

36:27.450 --> 36:29.942
You got it.

36:29.950 --> 36:33.887
I'm afraid that

36:33.890 --> 36:39.158
I'm gonna keep making
the same mistakes.

36:39.160 --> 36:43.290
Which ones, jack?

36:43.300 --> 36:46.326
Your turn,
tough girl.

36:48.870 --> 36:55.105
I'm afraid of people
really knowing me,

36:55.110 --> 36:57.829
And I don't want to
have this conversation,

36:57.840 --> 37:01.708
And this is
as far as it goes.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.540
What happened to you?

37:03.550 --> 37:07.088
Sorry, jack. That's
all you're getting.

37:09.490 --> 37:11.481
It's a start.

37:14.790 --> 37:18.158
[music playing]

37:33.450 --> 37:34.679
Good day.

37:34.680 --> 37:36.739
Yeah. Good day.

37:36.750 --> 37:39.117
[elevator dings]

37:47.490 --> 37:49.925
You want to go
for a drink?

37:49.930 --> 37:54.367
Last time, you said,
"drinks are never just drinks."

37:56.970 --> 37:58.961
[knock on door]

38:06.710 --> 38:08.439
What is it?

38:08.450 --> 38:11.010
We just made
things right.

38:14.920 --> 38:16.718
I just need to
clean up.

38:16.720 --> 38:19.553
I've seen a guy's
dump before.

38:21.190 --> 38:25.821
I haven't had a chance
to, uh, furnish the place.

38:31.540 --> 38:33.838
Where do you sleep?

38:34.740 --> 38:36.834
I have a bed.

38:39.450 --> 38:40.975
Bourbon?

38:40.980 --> 38:42.846
Perfect.

38:45.790 --> 38:47.440
Man on phone: Hey.
Your homegirl beth davis

38:47.450 --> 38:50.317
Didn't exist until
she went to the academy

38:50.320 --> 38:53.358
12 years ago.

38:53.360 --> 38:54.156
No birth records?

38:54.160 --> 38:58.028
Nope. I got nothing
in cyberspace.

38:58.030 --> 39:00.465
Keep looking.
I'm good for the money.

39:00.470 --> 39:01.869
You just keep digging.

39:01.870 --> 39:05.261
[music continues]
