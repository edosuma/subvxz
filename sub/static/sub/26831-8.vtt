00:44.587 --> 00:46.589
(indistinct murmuring)

01:13.991 --> 01:15.993
(whispering indistinctly)

01:33.219 --> 01:35.179
JOHN:
The Denon deal.

01:35.221 --> 01:37.014
LESLIE:
Yeah.

01:37.056 --> 01:39.517
JOHN: Can you close that,
today, Leslie?

01:39.558 --> 01:42.019
-Denon?
-Yeah.

01:42.061 --> 01:47.233
Well, that one probably slipped
through our fingers, John.

01:47.274 --> 01:51.237
It's been a fucked-up week.

01:51.278 --> 01:52.905
You were up against it.

01:52.947 --> 01:54.615
I get that.

01:54.657 --> 01:58.035
I'm just saying that taking out
both me and Stephen

01:58.077 --> 02:01.872
was a double whammy,

02:01.914 --> 02:04.750
if you will,

02:04.792 --> 02:07.628
in regard to the Denon deal.

02:07.670 --> 02:09.880
(exhales)

02:11.924 --> 02:14.301
Hold that on your gums
till the bleeding stops.

02:18.305 --> 02:21.892
Astonishing.

02:21.934 --> 02:26.355
There was a time,
in the near past...

02:26.397 --> 02:30.484
well, there was a time, son,
I had you down as a punk.

02:30.526 --> 02:32.486
(sighs)

02:32.528 --> 02:34.655
I wonder what else
I've been wrong about.

02:37.950 --> 02:39.952
Probably lots.

02:43.831 --> 02:46.625
Leslie.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.003
Yeah, John?

02:49.044 --> 02:51.589
JOHN:
Denon.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.633
Yeah?

02:54.675 --> 02:56.677
You have to get that done.

02:58.888 --> 03:01.557
I thought you left
all that behind.

03:01.599 --> 03:05.144
Can you get it done,
Leslie, today?

03:07.688 --> 03:09.940
Understood, John.

03:09.982 --> 03:13.027
Understood.

03:13.068 --> 03:16.989
Now, John, is it also understood

03:17.031 --> 03:22.411
that while I do plan
to get the Denon deal done,

03:22.453 --> 03:26.248
I have been through a bad week,

03:26.290 --> 03:29.627
physically and emotionally.

03:29.668 --> 03:31.462
Chemically.

03:31.503 --> 03:33.672
I mean, son,

03:33.714 --> 03:36.300
since you shot me in the mug,

03:36.342 --> 03:39.929
I have been
on some heavy mothers.

03:39.970 --> 03:42.097
Can you get it done?

03:42.139 --> 03:44.683
-Denon?
-Yeah, it's critical.

03:44.725 --> 03:47.102
To your important task?

03:47.144 --> 03:49.146
Yeah.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.108
Perhaps.

03:53.150 --> 03:55.736
Leslie, it's as critical
as it gets.

03:55.778 --> 03:58.822
Can you straighten up
and close it?

03:58.864 --> 04:02.284
I need you to focus
on your piping, man.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.747
Boy.

04:06.789 --> 04:11.585
The worm has really fucking
turned here, hasn't it?

04:11.627 --> 04:14.046
Can you close it?

04:16.006 --> 04:18.258
You wrote the book, Leslie.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.135
I did.

04:20.177 --> 04:22.137
Go show them.

04:22.179 --> 04:27.101
I want your old man
to get you home, kid.

04:27.142 --> 04:29.478
Get it done.

04:31.563 --> 04:35.567
So, I'll go.

04:35.609 --> 04:39.363
Do my best.

04:39.405 --> 04:42.116
And I won't even
do coke on the train.

04:42.157 --> 04:45.119
Cool.

04:46.328 --> 04:48.288
Yeah.

04:48.330 --> 04:50.332
It is cool.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.079
(bell tolling)

05:29.121 --> 05:33.333
(door opens, closes)

05:37.421 --> 05:39.423
Hey.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.927
JOHN:
Hey.

05:43.969 --> 05:45.387
You got my call?

05:45.429 --> 05:47.389
-Yeah.
-To call it off.

05:47.431 --> 05:49.933
Yeah.

05:51.185 --> 05:53.395
(laughing):
Thank God.

05:53.437 --> 05:55.939
Are you okay?

05:55.981 --> 05:58.484
Yeah.

05:58.525 --> 06:01.070
Good.

06:01.111 --> 06:04.364
Then, okay.

06:04.406 --> 06:06.408
"Then, okay," what?

06:06.450 --> 06:09.745
Then, okay. Fuck it.

06:09.787 --> 06:11.997
We'll take whatever blow comes.

06:12.039 --> 06:15.459
We'll... take store,

06:15.501 --> 06:19.463
rest, repair and get shipshape
again and, uh...

06:19.505 --> 06:22.341
that's that.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.967
Let's get home.

06:24.009 --> 06:27.179
So this guy's alive,
so the money's gone.

06:27.221 --> 06:29.431
We'll deal.

06:29.473 --> 06:32.768
The money's back.

06:32.810 --> 06:34.019
What?

06:34.061 --> 06:36.396
The money's back.

06:36.438 --> 06:39.191
W-What is?

06:40.400 --> 06:42.402
It's all there.

06:45.030 --> 06:47.616
Fuck.

06:47.658 --> 06:49.660
What?

06:53.413 --> 06:56.083
All of it?

06:56.125 --> 06:58.127
Yeah.

06:58.168 --> 07:00.170
That's great.

07:03.423 --> 07:06.218
Where's Myna?

07:06.260 --> 07:08.512
Myna's gone.

07:08.554 --> 07:10.264
There's no one here.

07:10.305 --> 07:12.141
She came for her, finally?

07:12.182 --> 07:15.310
I just got here. Myna was gone.

07:15.352 --> 07:17.813
Then the money was there.

07:20.816 --> 07:22.860
All right.

07:22.901 --> 07:24.486
(stammers)

07:24.528 --> 07:25.904
We're back.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.114
JOHN:
Okay.

07:27.156 --> 07:29.116
(chuckling):
Hey.

07:29.158 --> 07:31.535
It worked, we're back on track.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.788
Yeah.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.963
(crying softly)

08:02.357 --> 08:05.527
What's wrong, honey?

08:05.569 --> 08:06.862
I'm so sorry.

08:06.904 --> 08:08.906
JOHN:
Dad?

08:10.324 --> 08:12.409
Get your head ready.

08:12.451 --> 08:13.994

Therapeutically.

all the time?

some of your teeth?

to pull some teeth?

16:08.760 --> 16:10.345
Yeah.

16:10.387 --> 16:14.724
And have a swollen head
from getting hit in the head

16:14.766 --> 16:17.227
by a car a couple of days ago.

16:18.853 --> 16:22.691
Then you just have to smile,
like a buffoon.

16:30.407 --> 16:32.409

17:27.046 --> 17:29.048

17:52.781 --> 17:54.657
Thomas Tavner?

17:54.699 --> 17:58.244
My name is Laurent.
National Security Director.

17:59.454 --> 18:01.456
I have some questions for you.

18:05.335 --> 18:09.589
Now, Galvanized has been
in this game a long time.

18:09.631 --> 18:12.425
And we're sort of
the new kids on the block

18:12.467 --> 18:15.887
at First Consolidated Systems,
I know.

18:15.929 --> 18:19.307
But don't you, at Denon,

18:19.349 --> 18:22.685
as the world's largest developer
of fuel fields,

18:22.727 --> 18:25.146
want a fresh approach

18:25.188 --> 18:30.026
to pantrapped flam-packaged
thrust coupling?

18:30.068 --> 18:32.320
(quietly): I don't know
which one we'll go with,

18:32.362 --> 18:35.323
but they both blew
the fuckin' doors off McMillan.

18:35.365 --> 18:39.327
Yeah, that guy
from McMillan's weird, man.

18:39.369 --> 18:42.997
He really sucked the other day.

18:43.039 --> 18:46.251
SPEAKER: ...and torque-supported
tensile freighting.

18:47.836 --> 18:50.922
Do you know where your son is?

18:50.964 --> 18:53.591
-Which one?
-John Tavner.

18:53.633 --> 18:56.970
-Yes.
-Where is John Tavner?

18:57.011 --> 18:59.347
He's at Fort Meade
teaching a class

18:59.389 --> 19:02.183
on classic
army battlement infrastructure

19:02.225 --> 19:04.769
and the economy of war.

19:04.811 --> 19:08.731
-In the United States?
-Yes.

19:08.773 --> 19:10.567
He teaches college?

19:10.608 --> 19:12.569
He's an instructor
for the United States Army.

19:12.610 --> 19:14.612
He teaches
whatever they ask him to.

19:14.654 --> 19:17.532
That's what he's teaching now.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.119
Call them.

19:22.537 --> 19:24.497
Were you, earlier today,

19:24.539 --> 19:26.708
in a room
in the Sansille East Hotel

19:26.749 --> 19:28.918
in the 10th arrondissement
of Paris?

19:28.960 --> 19:30.920
-No.
-Where were you?

19:30.962 --> 19:32.964
Renting a tuxedo.

19:33.006 --> 19:34.966
AGATHE:
In order to...?

19:35.008 --> 19:37.802
In order to attend
the wedding of my son.

19:37.844 --> 19:40.138
My other son. In Paris.

19:40.179 --> 19:44.726
And in order to look nice,
I guess, while I'm doing that.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.856
His name?

19:49.898 --> 19:51.608
Edward...

19:51.649 --> 19:53.276
Tavner.

19:55.737 --> 19:59.073
-That's why you are in Paris?
-Yes.

20:00.909 --> 20:03.077
The setting of this wedding?

20:03.119 --> 20:05.330
TOM:
The Chapel of Saint Michael.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.040
The date?

20:08.249 --> 20:10.543
(sighs):
Seven hours from now.

20:10.585 --> 20:11.920
So...

20:16.174 --> 20:18.259
Our countries are
on good terms--

20:18.301 --> 20:20.386
you work for yours,
I work for mine--

20:20.428 --> 20:22.138
so I would appreciate it

20:22.180 --> 20:24.599
if you would submit
any further questions to me

20:24.641 --> 20:26.893
in the manner
to which I am accustomed,

20:26.935 --> 20:29.312
which is through my office.

20:30.480 --> 20:33.024
What is the nature of your job?

20:35.360 --> 20:38.780
I study, investigate
and assess threats

20:38.821 --> 20:41.240
to the lives of Americans.

20:44.202 --> 20:46.412
-What's yours?
-I apprehend people

20:46.454 --> 20:48.790
who commit or commission
the act of homicide

20:48.831 --> 20:50.833
in Luxembourg City, Luxembourg.

20:57.674 --> 20:59.842
Theoretically...

20:59.884 --> 21:03.596
what would happen if
those two things got confused?

21:04.597 --> 21:07.350
I wouldn't get confused.

21:11.020 --> 21:12.981
Me, either.

21:31.833 --> 21:33.918
My name is Bernice Tavner.
I'm Secretary

21:33.960 --> 21:37.088
of Transportation for
the United States of America.

21:37.130 --> 21:39.424
I'm in Paris with my family,

21:39.465 --> 21:41.426
which includes
my former husband,

21:41.467 --> 21:43.761
to attend our son's wedding.

21:43.803 --> 21:46.389
For that purpose only.

21:46.431 --> 21:48.641
And I have catering to arrange

21:48.683 --> 21:51.978
and a good number
of other pressing tasks.

21:52.020 --> 21:55.690
We didn't expect this to happen.

21:55.732 --> 21:57.859
This son is...

21:57.900 --> 22:00.403
We didn't think
he was going to get married--

22:00.445 --> 22:03.406
ever, I guess, honestly--

22:03.448 --> 22:05.825
and then all of a sudden...

22:05.867 --> 22:07.827
So I need him.

22:07.869 --> 22:10.246
I need him to make sure
that my son

22:10.288 --> 22:12.498
actually shows up
for this thing.

22:12.540 --> 22:14.584
(chuckles):
'Cause it's, like, 50-50.

22:14.625 --> 22:17.587
-(chuckles)
-'Cause this son is a little...

22:17.628 --> 22:19.505
he's a little drifty

22:19.547 --> 22:23.509
in regard to doing
the right thing all the time.

22:23.551 --> 22:25.553
(sighs):
So I guess...

22:25.595 --> 22:28.056
what I'm asking is...

22:28.097 --> 22:30.224
who the fuck are you,

22:30.266 --> 22:33.728
and what the fuck
are we doing here?

22:33.770 --> 22:36.773
And should I call
your prime minister and ask him?

23:17.980 --> 23:21.067
Do you want
to call Fort Meade now?

23:21.109 --> 23:23.694
There is no need.

23:23.736 --> 23:26.697
If your son John
is apprehended here today--

23:26.739 --> 23:29.075
which is likely--
and if on his person

23:29.117 --> 23:31.077
there is the sum
of 11 million euros--

23:31.119 --> 23:33.079
which is substantive motive
for the killing

23:33.121 --> 23:35.832
of Hector Barros
and Mikham Candahar--

23:35.873 --> 23:39.252
he'll be arrested
this afternoon.

23:39.293 --> 23:42.380
I would have preferred
that were you.

23:42.421 --> 23:45.133
And I don't care
what you direct.

23:45.174 --> 23:47.635
If you deterred
this investigation knowingly,

23:47.677 --> 23:49.929
I'll ensure
then apply charges against you

23:49.971 --> 23:52.181
for abetting homicide.

23:54.517 --> 23:56.561
We can leave now, correct?

24:13.661 --> 24:15.955
You glad to be going home?

24:15.997 --> 24:17.331
Yeah.

24:17.373 --> 24:19.667
Long trip.

24:19.709 --> 24:21.669
(whispers):
Yeah.

24:21.711 --> 24:23.671
Weird trip.

24:23.713 --> 24:25.339
Yeah.

24:28.009 --> 24:31.304
Move your fingers yet, Dennis?

24:31.345 --> 24:33.723
No.

24:33.764 --> 24:36.475
-They're not going to.
-What?

24:38.060 --> 24:40.897
They're not going to. Move.

24:42.356 --> 24:44.775
They're going to die
in three days.

24:46.152 --> 24:48.070

24:48.112 --> 24:50.323

I mean, fuck.

27:42.703 --> 27:46.582
We tried to get rid
of one detective; we made two.

-Agathe?
-Hmm?

Thank you.

30:34.208 --> 30:37.169

to make our decision.

-Hey.
-Hey.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.885
How we doing?

30:44.927 --> 30:48.097
We're doing, uh, we're doing
our speech here.

30:48.138 --> 30:49.765
-Wrapping up.
-(audience applauds)

30:49.807 --> 30:53.018
Our one-man speech thing
wrapping up for the audience.

30:53.060 --> 30:55.187
I'm from McMillan.

30:55.229 --> 30:59.191
Oh, we've heard from McMillan.
That guy.

30:59.233 --> 31:00.818
Can't remember at what phase,
though.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.236
Feels like a hundred years ago

31:02.278 --> 31:03.571
'cause I can't remember it
at all.

31:03.612 --> 31:05.197
Well, if you didn't hear it
from me,

31:05.239 --> 31:08.075
you didn't hear McMillan,
my man.

31:08.117 --> 31:10.619
-Okay.
-So, uh...

31:10.661 --> 31:12.121
who do you like?

31:12.162 --> 31:13.831
Who do you like here?

31:13.872 --> 31:17.835
Uh, Galvanized has a nice plan
and, uh...

31:17.876 --> 31:19.253
-Ah, Galvanized.
-Mm-hmm.

31:19.295 --> 31:20.838
Okay. I get it.

31:20.879 --> 31:24.717
You know, I founded that company
at the age of 24.

31:24.758 --> 31:26.802
I'm Leslie Claret.

31:26.844 --> 31:28.637
(audience applauds)

31:28.679 --> 31:29.888
You're Leslie Claret?

31:29.930 --> 31:31.515
I am.

31:31.557 --> 31:33.183
Structural Dynamics of Flow?

31:33.225 --> 31:35.227
'Fraid so. 'Fraid so.

31:35.269 --> 31:36.562

31:42.401 --> 31:45.279
(audience applauds)

31:45.321 --> 31:48.073
Look, do you mind if I do
the McMillan thing here?

31:48.115 --> 31:49.742
I mean, since it's pretty much
my company now?

31:49.783 --> 31:53.495
Oh, of course, of course,
of course.

31:53.537 --> 31:56.707
Okay.

31:56.749 --> 32:00.919
I don't know what he said, but I
want to talk to you about...

32:01.920 --> 32:03.589
Oh, yeah.

32:06.342 --> 32:10.137
Look, you want
to talk plate jousts

32:10.179 --> 32:14.433
or jim-jerried pam flam
transfastners?

32:14.475 --> 32:16.226
I could do that.

32:16.268 --> 32:18.771
I wrote the book here, right?

32:18.812 --> 32:21.815
I could go on all night
if you want.

32:21.857 --> 32:26.153
But let's...
let's go a little deeper.

32:26.195 --> 32:31.492
All right? Let's get real.
All right?

32:33.494 --> 32:38.582
All I'm trying to say is I get
the details same as you guys,

32:38.624 --> 32:42.920
maybe with a little more
experience. Okay.

32:42.961 --> 32:46.090
But I don't want
to talk shop today.

32:46.131 --> 32:50.344
You want to hear the word that
means the most to our trade?

32:50.386 --> 32:52.554
It's not technical.

32:52.596 --> 32:55.140
It's not fancy.

32:55.182 --> 33:00.145
You want to hear it? Okay.

33:00.187 --> 33:02.189
Home.

33:04.608 --> 33:08.654
What do we do at McMillan?

33:08.696 --> 33:11.407
What do we care about?

33:11.448 --> 33:13.409
This stuff that we dig up,

33:13.450 --> 33:18.789
transfer...
fuel, what have you...

33:18.831 --> 33:20.874
it's just sitting there.

33:20.916 --> 33:23.585
It's not writing poetry.

33:23.627 --> 33:27.464
It's just sitting there
and doing jack.

33:27.506 --> 33:32.094
And we'll get it up and
we'll get it from "A" to "B."

33:32.136 --> 33:34.638
Big deal.

33:34.680 --> 33:39.184
That's just a transaction,
you know?

33:39.226 --> 33:42.187
It's what we all do.

33:42.229 --> 33:47.192
But after that, after you've
performed your transaction--

33:47.234 --> 33:50.404
which, really, I'm afraid,
means nothing--

33:50.446 --> 33:56.076
we'll get you home,
which means a lot.

34:18.056 --> 34:20.309
LESLIE:
Soldier? Did it.

34:20.350 --> 34:22.895
Stood up. Thank you.

34:22.936 --> 34:25.022
Now, fly home, kid.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.399
You're a long way away.

34:27.441 --> 34:29.026
Fly home.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.986
Come home.

34:31.028 --> 34:33.030
RON:
Now comes the hard part.

34:33.071 --> 34:35.365
What?

34:35.407 --> 34:37.534
Hoping that the police
don't pull over your boat

34:37.576 --> 34:41.705
as you're crossing after they've
seen McClaren pass through.
