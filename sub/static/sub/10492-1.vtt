00:30.739 --> 00:32.656
Radio commentator:
Murphy's flushed to the outside

00:32.825 --> 00:36.536
and he is gonna be slammed to the turf
at the 31 by Jackson.

00:36.704 --> 00:39.038
Murphy getting zero protection
in the pocket

00:39.206 --> 00:41.290
from this swarming
Cuyahoga defense,

00:41.458 --> 00:45.044
but still keeping the Coldwater
Black Bears in this ball game.

00:45.212 --> 00:47.296
For those of you
just joining us, this is

00:47.464 --> 00:49.424
the Ohio River Valley
Sports Network

00:49.591 --> 00:51.592
reporting live from the 1991

00:51.760 --> 00:54.262
Ohio high school football
state championship game

00:54.430 --> 00:56.639
with the Cuyahoga Raiders
taking on

00:56.807 --> 00:59.934
the Cinderella story...
the Coldwater Black Bears.

01:00.102 --> 01:01.978
The perennial powerhouse
Red Raiders

01:02.146 --> 01:04.563
hail from the big city
of Cleveland, Ohio.

01:04.732 --> 01:08.735
Their high school has more students
than the entire population

01:08.902 --> 01:11.112
of the small town of Coldwater.

01:11.280 --> 01:14.115
And the big story for Coldwater
has been quarterback Scott Murphy,

01:14.283 --> 01:17.493
raised by a single mother
who works in a factory.

01:17.661 --> 01:19.704
He was recently named
"Mr. Football"

01:19.872 --> 01:22.123
as the outstanding player
in the state.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.001
This is it, folks.

01:25.169 --> 01:27.545
A Coldwater victory here
would be a fairy tale ending

01:27.713 --> 01:29.422
for this hardworking
blue-collar community.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.466
13 seconds left in the game,

01:31.633 --> 01:33.760
just one time out remaining.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.179
Coldwater needs a touchdown
right here

01:36.346 --> 01:38.222
to win the state championship.

01:38.390 --> 01:41.726
Scott Murphy, "Mr. Football,"
deep to return the kick.

01:41.894 --> 01:44.020
And he'll take it
to the 50, to the 45.

01:44.188 --> 01:46.272
Murphy's hit, but he breaks the tackle,
stays on his feet,

01:46.440 --> 01:47.815
- breaks another tackle...
- Come on, come on!

01:47.983 --> 01:49.776
...inside the 35, inside the 30,

01:49.943 --> 01:51.736
and he's knocked down
at the 26.

01:51.904 --> 01:55.198
And he'll quickly call a time out
to talk to Coach Hand.

01:57.159 --> 01:59.327
This has been
one of the great games

01:59.495 --> 02:01.996
in Ohio high school
football history.

02:04.082 --> 02:06.959
3.5 seconds left on the clock
here in the fourth quarter.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.002
Third down, 42-38.

02:09.170 --> 02:11.631
Words exchanged
on the sidelines

02:11.799 --> 02:14.091
as Murphy appears
to be arguing

02:14.259 --> 02:16.135
the final play call
by Coach Hand.

02:16.303 --> 02:17.720
That's the play.

02:17.888 --> 02:19.972
Commentator: They seem to have
agreed on something.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.933
Murphy is headed back out
onto the field.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.810
He's got one final play

02:23.977 --> 02:26.521
to make a miracle happen
here in Coldwater.

02:26.688 --> 02:28.689
- Crowd: Murphy! Murphy!
- Murphy: Black seven!

02:28.857 --> 02:30.274
Black seven!
Hike!

02:30.442 --> 02:32.193
Commentator: Murphy drops back,
looks deep.

02:32.361 --> 02:33.611
Hall's wide open
in the end zone.

02:33.779 --> 02:35.905
He's open. He's open.
He's open!

02:36.949 --> 02:38.658
Commentator: He tucks it.
He's gonna run it.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.618
(crowd cheering)

02:44.206 --> 02:46.165
- Now inside the 20, to the 15...
- Run, run, run, run!

02:46.333 --> 02:48.000
...to the 10, to the 5!

02:50.128 --> 02:52.547
Touchdown, Coldwater!

02:52.714 --> 02:57.552
They will be the state champions
of Ohio! Wow.

02:57.719 --> 02:59.720
(Murphy screams)

03:11.066 --> 03:13.109
(birds chirping)

03:20.284 --> 03:22.577
(brace squeaks)

03:28.584 --> 03:30.960
(snores, mumbles)

03:33.881 --> 03:36.173
I'm never drinking
with you lightweights again.

03:36.341 --> 03:38.885
Man on shoulder:
But you said that last week.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.304
Murphy:
Yeah, well, I mean it this time.

03:46.935 --> 03:48.311
That's it?

03:48.478 --> 03:50.980
Ain't no tuck-in,
no kiss good night?

03:51.148 --> 03:52.607
It's my birthday, Murph.

03:52.774 --> 03:54.775
That's why I didn't drop you off
at the curb.

04:00.365 --> 04:03.784
♪ So your hometown's
bringing you down ♪

04:03.952 --> 04:06.954
♪ Or you're drowning
in the small talk... ♪

04:07.122 --> 04:08.873
Man:
I don't need help.

04:09.041 --> 04:10.958
My body-to-booze ratio
is enormous.

04:11.126 --> 04:12.501
I have the liver strength
of 10 men.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.545
I'm not drunk.

04:18.841 --> 04:21.260
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I got a sharp pain in my stomach.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.137
- What does that mean?
- Don't eat three dozen wings.

04:23.305 --> 04:25.348
Now come on, man.
You know I'm paranoid.

04:25.515 --> 04:27.433
- What side's your appendix on?
- Your right side. Now get up.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.477
That's the side that hurts.
Oh, I got appendicitis.

04:29.645 --> 04:32.563
No, you don't have appendicitis.
You'd lose your appetite. Now let's go.

04:32.731 --> 04:35.316
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Murphy, take a look at this.

04:35.484 --> 04:38.027
I need you to be the beneficiary
of my life insurance policy.

04:38.195 --> 04:40.154
- Hell no, Dwight. Hell no.
- No, come on, man.

04:40.322 --> 04:42.239
If I croak in my sleep, I need to know
my mom's taken care of.

04:42.407 --> 04:43.824
I got plenty of people
I gotta worry about.

04:43.992 --> 04:45.701
My brother would put her
in a home, man.

04:45.869 --> 04:47.870
Please?

04:51.667 --> 04:54.001
Thanks, Murph.

04:54.169 --> 04:56.170
Hey, we're worth a lot
dead, Murphy.

04:56.338 --> 04:58.464
If I bite it,
you can have some.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.675
I know the bank's
been riding you, brother.

05:00.842 --> 05:02.510
Murphy: Just quit talking
and go back to sleep.

05:02.678 --> 05:04.512
You're "Mr. Football."

05:04.680 --> 05:07.223
And in '91
you sent them packing.

05:07.391 --> 05:08.933
Don't sweat it, Murphy.

05:09.101 --> 05:11.352
You'll find a way to win.

05:11.520 --> 05:13.521
You always did!

06:02.863 --> 06:05.239
(sighs)

06:17.753 --> 06:20.046
(door creaks)

06:36.980 --> 06:38.773
(clatters)

06:42.069 --> 06:43.944
(door opens)

06:44.112 --> 06:45.780
Murphy:
What are they doing up?

06:45.947 --> 06:47.573
They heard you drive up.
They've been waiting

06:47.741 --> 06:49.784
for you to come inside.

06:49.951 --> 06:51.952
(commentator speaking
on radio)

06:55.290 --> 06:58.292
What do you do out there anyway?
Just listen to the radio?

06:58.460 --> 07:00.336
Yeah, Mace.

07:00.504 --> 07:02.797
Just listen to the radio.

07:06.843 --> 07:10.346
Hey, so don't forget
the bank appointment.

07:10.514 --> 07:13.766
Murphy: How could I?
You told the whole town.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.976
I didn't... I only told Sasha.

07:16.144 --> 07:18.562
Mace, we live in "Backwater."

07:18.730 --> 07:21.357
You tell one person... you might as well
put it up on a billboard.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.861
- (machine beeps)
- Dispatcher: Signal 50 Coldwater.

07:26.029 --> 07:28.614
- (pager beeps)
- Units respond to 267 Main Street

07:28.782 --> 07:30.783
for an unknown fire
to the rear of the building.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.661
Signal 50 Coldwater volunteers
please respond,

07:33.829 --> 07:35.871
- 267 Main Street, for an unknown fire.
- Honey.

07:36.039 --> 07:39.166
You've been up all night
and it's not even your shift.

07:39.334 --> 07:41.168
You don't have to go.

07:41.336 --> 07:44.046
(siren wails)

07:44.214 --> 07:46.215
- (man babbling)
- (radio chatter)

07:51.513 --> 07:54.849
- What's going on, Gig? Is this it?
- Gig: Aw, Jesus, Coach...

07:55.016 --> 07:58.435
...walking down the street,
I was barbecuing.

07:58.603 --> 08:00.354
- Wham! The whole grill is on fire.
- All right, go sit down.

08:00.522 --> 08:02.690
Hang on a second.
You stay back with me on the pump.

08:02.858 --> 08:05.526
Barney, Rodriguez,
you guys handle the hose.

08:07.028 --> 08:09.155
Murphy: If you're gonna blame me,
at least let me fight it.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.240
No, I'm not doing that.
I just want to talk to you

08:11.408 --> 08:13.200
about the halftime
ceremony tomorrow.

08:13.368 --> 08:15.411
- I watch the station on game day.
- Hand: Celina can cover us.

08:15.579 --> 08:18.873
Murphy: Celina is 40 minutes away.
But, hey, if you don't need me,

08:19.040 --> 08:20.916
I got plenty of work
I can do at home.

08:21.084 --> 08:23.752
Hand: Like what?
Babysitting those damn beans?

08:23.920 --> 08:25.838
You know, if you planted corn
like everybody else,

08:26.006 --> 08:28.382
you could just sit back
and watch it grow. Charge the line.

08:28.550 --> 08:31.051
Murphy: So you're coaching
farmers now too?

08:31.219 --> 08:33.511
Coldwater's corn country
for a reason.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.639
Yeah, well, it used to be
football country too.

08:35.807 --> 08:37.057
What are you, four and six?

08:37.225 --> 08:39.101
- Six and four.
- Close enough.

08:39.269 --> 08:40.936
You know, if that's meant
to hurt me, it doesn't.

08:41.104 --> 08:43.563
These guys may not be as talented
as you guys once were, but I'll tell you

08:43.732 --> 08:46.066
something... they play twice as hard
and I like them just as much.

08:46.234 --> 08:47.735
Yeah, well, you should be
seven and three

08:47.903 --> 08:49.778
if you'd have hit Taylor
on that deep post against Marion

08:49.946 --> 08:52.448
instead of bringing in Wilson
to kick a 42-yard field goal,

08:52.616 --> 08:54.491
and the guy can't hit
the broad side of a barn.

08:54.659 --> 08:57.077
You know, for somebody
who's too busy

08:57.245 --> 08:58.871
to come down
and watch football games,

08:59.039 --> 09:01.373
you sure as hell know a lot
about what's going on in 'em.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.083
Yeah, well, I don't listen...

09:03.251 --> 09:05.169
got 'em playing on the damn radio
at the station.

09:05.337 --> 09:09.089
You think I don't know where you go
on Friday nights, huh?

09:09.257 --> 09:11.342
You think I'm blind,
can't see your headlights

09:11.509 --> 09:13.302
up there on that bluff?

09:13.470 --> 09:15.429
Why don't you get your ass
out of that truck

09:15.597 --> 09:17.473
and down on the field
where it means something?

09:17.641 --> 09:19.475
It's bad enough to listen to you
lose on the radio.

09:19.643 --> 09:21.310
You think I want to come down
and witness it in person?

09:21.478 --> 09:23.103
Think you can do any better?

09:23.271 --> 09:24.980
Come on down
and coach my quarterbacks.

09:25.148 --> 09:27.441
Sure, as soon as you come help me
work my back 40.

09:27.609 --> 09:29.526
I'll help you plant... some corn.

09:29.694 --> 09:33.113
Why don't you worry about your field,
and I'll worry about mine?

10:31.172 --> 10:32.423
(buzzing)

10:49.858 --> 10:52.693
People said you were crazy
for growing soybeans here,

10:52.861 --> 10:54.528
but they look good to me.

10:54.696 --> 10:56.697
Yeah, yeah, looking pretty good.
What've you got?

10:56.865 --> 10:58.866
Certified mail.

11:00.243 --> 11:02.202
Is Sasha around?

11:02.370 --> 11:04.246
She took the girls
to the park.

11:04.414 --> 11:06.665
Just put her stuff
on the porch.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.709
Oh, wait.
One more thing.

11:08.877 --> 11:12.046
My mom said that Macy told
Joanne Bragden

11:12.213 --> 11:15.049
to tell her to tell me
to tell you to get a move on...

11:15.216 --> 11:17.176
something about
"Frank and a tie"?

11:17.344 --> 11:18.552
Oh.

11:33.693 --> 11:36.403
Man: Mr. Murphy, it's been 120 days
since your last payment.

11:36.571 --> 11:38.864
Murphy: Frank said we could
work something out...

11:39.032 --> 11:41.408
something about a "forbearance"
till harvest.

11:41.576 --> 11:43.952
I filled out
all this paperwork.

11:45.163 --> 11:47.414
The crop's about 80%
right now.

11:47.582 --> 11:49.917
It's gonna be ready to harvest
real soon.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.961
Were you friends with Frank?

11:53.129 --> 11:55.005
Yeah, kinda.

11:55.173 --> 11:57.091
I played ball with Chris Hall.

11:57.258 --> 11:59.259
- Chris who?
- The football player

11:59.427 --> 12:01.470
who does your ads.

12:03.932 --> 12:05.933
Uh-huh.

12:06.101 --> 12:07.935
Um, Mr. Murphy, I am...

12:08.103 --> 12:10.479
I'm sure that... ahem...

12:10.647 --> 12:13.524
Frank thought he was helping you out,
but he's actually

12:13.691 --> 12:15.526
put you in a pretty bad
situation.

12:16.861 --> 12:18.654
It's not that bad, is it?

12:18.822 --> 12:21.407
To be honest, Mr. Murphy,
based on your equity

12:21.574 --> 12:23.534
and your
employment history, this...

12:23.701 --> 12:25.702
this loan should have never been
approved.

12:27.038 --> 12:30.874
Well, I already got the loan.
I just need the extension.

12:32.293 --> 12:34.169
It's too late for an extension.

12:34.337 --> 12:36.171
The bank's already
called in your loan.

12:36.339 --> 12:39.967
What do you mean?
What do you mean, called in my loan?

12:40.135 --> 12:42.636
The power of sale foreclosure
proceedings have already begun.

12:42.804 --> 12:45.389
Your property will be on the market
in the next several days

12:45.557 --> 12:49.476
unless... unless you can pay
a significant sum here today.

12:49.644 --> 12:51.520
I'm a farmer.

12:51.688 --> 12:54.106
I can't pay you
until my crops are ready.

12:55.358 --> 12:57.317
If you can raise something
before we get any offers,

12:57.485 --> 12:59.486
I'm sure we might be able
to take another look.

12:59.654 --> 13:01.864
Otherwise I'm sorry,
Mr. Murphy.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.991
Well, I'm not asking you
for a bailout.

13:04.159 --> 13:07.494
I can pay you in two weeks,
in less than a month.

13:07.662 --> 13:10.122
Man: There's nothing I can do.
I'm sorry.

13:15.837 --> 13:17.963
Okay, ladies,

13:18.131 --> 13:19.840
pick your poison.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.508
Girls:
Operation. Operation.

13:21.676 --> 13:23.177
Play this one.

13:23.344 --> 13:25.179
(girls whine)
Nah...

13:25.346 --> 13:26.805
Girl:
Look at this thing.

13:26.973 --> 13:29.016
(girls chattering)

13:34.355 --> 13:47.075
(crowd cheering)

13:50.205 --> 13:52.206
Two guys wide open...

13:54.042 --> 13:56.668
and you run it, like an idiot.

14:03.009 --> 14:05.302
(static buzzes)

14:09.682 --> 14:11.934
(groans)

14:23.655 --> 14:27.407
(knocking on door)

14:27.575 --> 14:30.369
Girl:
Daddy? Daddy?

14:46.594 --> 14:49.012
Sorry, I fell asleep
with the girls.

14:49.180 --> 14:51.640
No, that's okay.
How did it go at the bank?

14:51.808 --> 14:53.392
It went great.

14:54.435 --> 14:57.020
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14:57.188 --> 14:59.439
What did I tell you?
I knew it would work out.

14:59.607 --> 15:02.192
Guess who I ran into.

15:02.360 --> 15:03.694
Who's that?

15:03.861 --> 15:05.654
They wanted to stick around
and say hi.

15:05.822 --> 15:07.948
(loud music playing)

15:10.034 --> 15:12.494
- Oh, there he is.
- (music stops)

15:13.955 --> 15:15.247
"Mr. Football."

15:17.125 --> 15:18.208
Hey, Hall.

15:18.376 --> 15:20.919
Hey, Hall?
What the hell is that?

15:22.755 --> 15:24.631
Hey, Scotty.
Nice to see you.

15:24.799 --> 15:26.425
- How have you been, buddy?
- Good.

15:26.593 --> 15:27.968
I send you tickets.
I don't see you.

15:28.136 --> 15:31.346
I ain't got many years
left in me, you know?

15:31.514 --> 15:33.640
Oh, hey, we got the Steelers
on Monday,

15:33.808 --> 15:37.102
but I wanted to get back
for the ceremony and see the guys.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.313
Check it.

15:39.480 --> 15:40.939
(laughing)
Oh, yeah.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.817
- I don't think mine would fit anymore.
- Like a glove.

15:43.985 --> 15:45.819
Murphy: Come on, Mace,
the girls are next door.

15:45.987 --> 15:47.362
We really should get going.

15:47.530 --> 15:49.615
Oh, that's right.
You have kids.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.158
Two.

15:51.326 --> 15:54.286
Hey, why don't you guys
come for dinner?

15:54.454 --> 15:57.080
- I can cook and...
- Mace, I'm sure they got plenty of...

15:57.248 --> 15:59.583
- No, you could just catch up.
...people they have to see besides us.

15:59.751 --> 16:01.752
Come on, we really should
get going... the girls.

16:01.919 --> 16:04.296
- Okay.
- It's good seeing you guys.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.381
Yeah.

16:07.675 --> 16:10.010
(engine starts)

16:10.178 --> 16:13.055
- Hall: Thank you.
- No, it's so good to see you guys.

16:14.432 --> 16:17.476
- I got it.
- Oh, thank you.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.562
Hey, we're doing something
at Pal's after the game.

16:20.730 --> 16:23.148
You'd better be there.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.734
See you guys.

16:25.902 --> 16:27.319
Great.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.196
Yeah.

16:30.448 --> 16:32.866
(country music playing
on radio)

16:41.376 --> 16:43.543
I thought you'd be excited.

16:44.545 --> 16:46.588
You were so close
in high school.

16:46.756 --> 16:49.257
Yeah, well, high school
was a long time ago.

16:50.259 --> 16:51.885
Are you mad
they're together?

16:52.053 --> 16:54.262
No. What kind of question
is that?

16:56.391 --> 16:58.266
You know, if I...

16:58.434 --> 17:01.228
if I saw my high school flame
with my best friend,

17:01.396 --> 17:02.813
I might wonder.

17:02.980 --> 17:05.898
Yeah, well,
I really could care less.

17:06.067 --> 17:08.068
Since when did you have
a high school flame?

17:08.236 --> 17:10.904
Well, we weren't "class couple"

17:11.071 --> 17:12.823
like you two or anything,

17:12.990 --> 17:16.201
but if I hadn't fallen for you
when you were laid up in the hospital,

17:16.368 --> 17:18.369
who knows?

17:20.915 --> 17:21.998
Whatever.

17:22.165 --> 17:25.585
I'm just saying
I wouldn't mind having them over.

17:25.752 --> 17:27.378
I think it'd be good.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.881
Good for what?

17:30.049 --> 17:33.051
So we can talk about how I got laid off
when the plant closed down?

17:33.219 --> 17:35.971
Or good so they can walk in the den
and see the holes in the walls

17:36.139 --> 17:38.014
and the plastic
covering the windows?

17:38.182 --> 17:40.684
If they're so interested
in seeing holes in walls

17:40.852 --> 17:42.728
and plastic covering windows,

17:42.895 --> 17:45.564
they don't have to
walk into the den.

17:45.732 --> 17:48.400
We've got that
right out on the porch.

17:52.447 --> 17:54.406
(chuckles)

17:56.325 --> 17:58.118
You're crazy,
you know that?

17:59.871 --> 18:01.705
Now who the hell
was your high school flame?

18:01.873 --> 18:04.166
Wouldn't you like to know?

18:05.251 --> 18:07.502
Murphy: So what,
now you aren't gonna tell me?

18:19.056 --> 18:20.807
(knocks on door)

18:20.975 --> 18:23.310
(door opens)

18:25.229 --> 18:27.439
Daddy, can we sleep with you?

18:27.607 --> 18:29.858
- (Macy chuckles)
- We're cold.

18:30.026 --> 18:31.610
Macy:
Okay, come on.

18:34.155 --> 18:35.655
Girl: Yay.

18:35.823 --> 18:38.158
- Girl: Are we going under the covers?
- Macy: Come here, sweetie.

18:38.326 --> 18:40.494
- Macy: Oh.
- Girl: Daddy.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.330
Where are you going?

18:43.498 --> 18:44.623
- Macy: Honey.
- Daddy?

18:44.791 --> 18:45.999
Older daughter:
Dad?

19:00.681 --> 19:03.016
Murphy: They're frozen.
The damn beans are frozen.

19:03.184 --> 19:05.185
Macy: It's okay.
It's gonna warm up, right?

19:05.353 --> 19:06.978
No, it's not okay.
If we don't harvest today,

19:07.146 --> 19:08.688
they're gonna rot
off the bush.

19:08.856 --> 19:10.315
What are you looking for?

19:10.483 --> 19:12.192
The phone book. Where's the phone book?
I gotta call Red.

19:12.360 --> 19:14.611
- Wait, wait, it's here. It's okay.
- We're gonna lose our...

19:14.779 --> 19:16.404
we're gonna lose everything.

19:16.572 --> 19:18.990
- No, honey, no. We're not gonna...
- I can't believe the frost. Damn it.

19:19.158 --> 19:22.369
No. Listen to me.
We're not gonna lose everything, okay?

19:22.537 --> 19:24.621
- You said it was 80%, right?
- Yeah.

19:24.789 --> 19:26.540
Okay, so we make 80%.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.333
We harvest sooner

19:28.501 --> 19:30.502
and we get the money
to the bank sooner.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.463
Yeah. Yeah.

19:33.631 --> 19:34.923
- Okay.
- It's okay.

19:35.091 --> 19:37.133
Okay, I gotta call Red.

19:37.301 --> 19:38.468
Okay.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.555
The freeze hit hard all over.

19:41.722 --> 19:44.933
They've been calling from Illinois
to Michigan for one of these...

19:45.101 --> 19:48.353
probably the last soy header
in the area.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.397
Thanks for bringing it
so quickly, Red.

19:50.565 --> 19:52.190
Hey, no problem.

19:52.358 --> 19:53.942
Macy: Thanks, Red.
You're a lifesaver.

19:54.110 --> 19:57.404
Red: Better get those beans in
before the rain gets here

19:57.572 --> 19:59.739
or you won't be running that thing
through that field.

19:59.907 --> 20:01.408
I know, Red.
Thanks.

20:02.493 --> 20:05.745
Red: Hustle up... you can make
the halftime ceremony.

20:39.822 --> 20:42.407
(metal groaning)

20:42.575 --> 20:44.492
Girl:
What was that?

20:47.955 --> 20:50.248
(screeching)

20:51.417 --> 20:53.293
(engine stops)

20:53.461 --> 20:55.754
(mutters)
Damn.

21:18.653 --> 21:21.154
(bangs)

21:24.533 --> 21:26.576
(thunder rumbling)

21:43.386 --> 21:45.512
Honey, I heard the noise
from the house.

21:45.680 --> 21:47.555
Thank God you're okay.

21:47.723 --> 21:49.641
I'm not okay.
Every cent we had,

21:49.809 --> 21:52.018
every penny my mom left us is gone.
It's all wasted.

21:52.186 --> 21:53.561
Oh, honey, calm down.

21:53.729 --> 21:56.064
Calm down? I just broke
the last soy header in the state.

21:56.232 --> 21:58.108
Well, Red can fix it, I'm sure.

21:58.275 --> 22:00.694
Yeah, in two or three days.
The beans will be rotten by then.

22:00.861 --> 22:03.488
- So we pick them.
- Pick them? It's 200 acres, Macy.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.991
Don't be so stupid.

22:07.743 --> 22:09.369
(softly)
Scott...

22:14.542 --> 22:17.293
I'm sorry.
Just go back inside.

22:17.461 --> 22:20.672
I'm gonna go down and see
if Red can find me another header, okay?

22:20.840 --> 22:22.674
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

22:27.304 --> 22:29.556
(engine starts)

22:56.625 --> 22:58.752
(thunder crashing)

22:59.795 --> 23:02.088
(rain pattering)

23:30.076 --> 23:31.993
Macy:
Okay, are we ready?

23:32.161 --> 23:34.662
- Girl: Daddy.
- Macy: There you are.

23:34.830 --> 23:37.373
Hey. Hey.

23:37.541 --> 23:39.250
Are you guys ready
for the game?

23:39.418 --> 23:40.460
Yeah.

23:40.628 --> 23:43.463
I tried to call the shop,
but I didn't get an answer.

23:43.631 --> 23:45.173
They had an extra one
at Hoover Heights.

23:45.341 --> 23:47.092
Yeah? The rain's not gonna be
a problem?

23:47.259 --> 23:48.676
No, Red said it's gonna
let up any minute.

23:48.844 --> 23:50.970
- Okay.
- Hey, you guys get going to the game.

23:51.138 --> 23:53.056
- Get in the car with Sasha.
- Sasha: Come on, guys, let's go.

23:53.224 --> 23:54.682
- Don't forget your football.
- Are you coming with us?

23:54.850 --> 23:57.060
No, I'm gonna meet you guys
at the diner after the game.

23:57.228 --> 23:58.978
- Youngest daughter: Okay.
- Both girls: Bye, Daddy.

23:59.146 --> 24:01.147
- You're gonna come when you're done?
- Yeah. You guys go on.

24:01.315 --> 24:02.899
- I'll meet you at Pal's afterwards.
- Okay.

24:03.067 --> 24:05.693
Macy:
Okay, you guys, come on.

24:05.861 --> 24:08.154
(all chattering)

24:11.826 --> 24:13.326
Commentator:
Coldwater is struggling here

24:13.494 --> 24:15.870
on a rainy homecoming
Saturday afternoon,

24:16.038 --> 24:18.581
down by 14 already
in the first quarter,

24:18.749 --> 24:21.501
Coach Hand probably wishing
some of these players here today

24:21.669 --> 24:24.087
were from the 1991
state championship team.

24:29.260 --> 24:31.094
Commentator: And everyone
is hoping the rain lets up

24:31.262 --> 24:33.304
in time for
the halftime ceremony

24:33.472 --> 24:35.515
to recognize
the '91 state champions

24:35.683 --> 24:39.435
who won big here
on this field 20 years ago.

24:39.603 --> 24:41.813
That team was led
by Scott Murphy...

24:41.981 --> 24:43.481
"Mr. Football."

24:43.649 --> 24:45.567
Chris Hall is here
signing autographs...

24:45.734 --> 24:48.027
(radio off)

25:16.223 --> 25:19.017
Dwight: Don't sweat it, Murphy.
You'll find a way to win.

25:19.185 --> 25:21.436
You always did.

25:30.404 --> 25:33.448
Dwight:
We're worth a lot dead, Murphy.

25:41.457 --> 25:43.750
(door opens)

25:50.841 --> 25:52.217
(door closes)

25:53.219 --> 25:56.095
(engine starts, roars)

26:02.144 --> 26:04.562
(coughing)

26:34.760 --> 26:36.511
(birds chirping)

26:37.513 --> 26:39.514
(knocking on window)

26:42.810 --> 26:44.102
Man:
Scotty.

26:50.651 --> 26:52.485
What are you doing, man?

26:56.448 --> 26:59.284
Murphy: Thank God.
I'm such an idiot.

27:08.210 --> 27:09.794
Why is it all foggy?

27:09.962 --> 27:11.629
Are you making out
with yourself in there?

27:11.797 --> 27:12.839
(chuckles)

27:14.008 --> 27:15.508
What the...?

27:22.266 --> 27:24.142
What the hell?

27:24.310 --> 27:26.894
Come on.
We're gonna be late.

27:27.062 --> 27:28.479
Late for what?

27:28.647 --> 27:31.065
(school bell ringing)

27:33.444 --> 27:35.486
(voices chattering)

27:37.656 --> 27:41.034
Hey, Murphy,
good game last week, man.

27:46.248 --> 27:48.624
Hi, Scotty.

27:51.795 --> 27:55.256
Scott Murphy,
where have you been?

27:55.424 --> 27:58.343
If you guys are gonna skip
sixth period, at least tell me.

27:58.510 --> 28:00.386
I was waiting around for you
like an idiot.

28:00.554 --> 28:02.597
Ugh, I'm so mad at you,
I could just...

28:05.559 --> 28:08.061
I could just...

28:12.733 --> 28:14.901
Why can't I stay mad at you?

28:15.069 --> 28:16.861
Oh, you guys make me sick.

28:18.572 --> 28:20.406
Hall:
Hustle up, lover boy.

28:21.950 --> 28:23.326
Murphy: What's going on?
Am I dead?

28:23.494 --> 28:25.411
Hall: We're both dead
unless you hurry up.

28:39.259 --> 28:41.386
Yo, Murph,
hey, check out my new game face.

28:41.553 --> 28:42.970
I call it "Fourth Down."
Ready?

28:43.138 --> 28:46.641
(grunts, yells)

28:46.809 --> 28:48.559
Huh?

28:48.727 --> 28:49.769
Tough.

28:49.937 --> 28:51.354
Pearson,
you look so skinny.

28:51.522 --> 28:54.107
Hey, I've been working out, man.

28:54.274 --> 28:55.817
I got balls.

28:55.984 --> 28:57.610
Hey, come on, D,
he's just hating you, bro.

28:57.778 --> 29:01.280
Oh, I get it. You're just trying my
confidence before the big game, right?

29:01.448 --> 29:03.116
These guns go bang, baby.

29:03.283 --> 29:06.661
Murphy, get in here.

29:10.332 --> 29:12.959
Close the door.

29:13.127 --> 29:15.128
All right, what happened
to you today?

29:16.380 --> 29:18.881
Mrs. Bird said
you weren't in Lit class... again.

29:19.049 --> 29:21.300
No, Coach.

29:21.468 --> 29:22.510
(chuckles)

29:22.678 --> 29:24.554
I wasn't anywhere near
Lit class today.

29:24.721 --> 29:26.806
Well, you missing class
isn't funny to me, Scott.

29:26.974 --> 29:29.308
I don't know why
it's funny to you.

29:30.811 --> 29:32.145
Sit down.

29:35.816 --> 29:37.525
All right, look,

29:37.693 --> 29:40.361
I know you've already got
one foot out of this town.

29:40.529 --> 29:42.280
And a lot of people
around here think

29:42.448 --> 29:44.449
that whatever you do on Friday night
is all that matters.

29:44.616 --> 29:45.992
Well, I'm not one of them.

29:46.160 --> 29:47.827
I want you to be a man

29:47.995 --> 29:50.288
who's good for more than
one night a week.

29:51.331 --> 29:54.542
If you skip class one more time,
Scott, I'm gonna bench you.

29:54.710 --> 29:56.836
I don't care if I gotta play
a freshman quarterback

29:57.004 --> 29:59.005
in the state finals.
I'll do it.

29:59.173 --> 30:01.757
Coach...

30:01.925 --> 30:03.843
you mean we'll play Cuyahoga
this week?

30:04.011 --> 30:05.678
Is that supposed to be
funny too?

30:05.846 --> 30:07.889
You know, the Red Raiders
got seven all-Americans

30:08.056 --> 30:11.142
and one linebacker who thinks you
cheated him out of being "Mr. Football."

30:11.310 --> 30:13.811
He'd like nothing better
than to clean your clock.

30:13.979 --> 30:15.313
Get dressed.

30:15.481 --> 30:18.191
All right then, suicides

30:18.358 --> 30:20.735
if everybody is not on the field
in two minutes.

30:20.903 --> 30:23.362
Let's go. Let's go.

30:23.530 --> 30:25.364
(blows whistle)

30:25.532 --> 30:28.367
Let's go, guys.
Let's go. Let's pick it up.

30:38.670 --> 30:41.047
This is crazy.

30:41.215 --> 30:42.340
(whistle tweets)

30:42.508 --> 30:44.383
Well, ladies and gentlemen,

30:44.551 --> 30:46.469
our quarterback
has decided to join us.

30:46.637 --> 30:48.346
- You can thank him personally later.
- Man: What happened, Murph?

30:48.514 --> 30:50.723
- (men grumbling)
- What's the matter with you, Murph?

30:50.891 --> 30:52.016
Sorry, guys.

30:52.184 --> 30:53.976
All right, offense, defense,
line it up.

30:54.144 --> 30:56.521
- Red 24... let's run it.
- Man: Let's go, D. Come on now.

30:56.688 --> 30:59.232
- You want me to quarterback?
- Scott, knock it off.

30:59.399 --> 31:00.983
Get in there
and play some football.

31:01.151 --> 31:04.195
Hall, what's Red?
Is that with you in the slot or...?

31:04.363 --> 31:06.197
- That's not funny, man.
- Man: Let's go Red.

31:06.365 --> 31:09.075
Man: Come on, D, let's do it.
Come through, come through.

31:09.243 --> 31:11.202
Men: Come on, man.
Okay, Red 24.

31:12.246 --> 31:13.746
Red 24.

31:15.332 --> 31:17.375
- Get off my butt, Murph.
- The center's over here, Murph.

31:17.543 --> 31:18.918
- Oh.
- (men chuckle)

31:19.086 --> 31:21.254
Man:
Get him this time.

31:23.090 --> 31:24.632
(squeals)
Down.

31:25.676 --> 31:26.717
Set.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.219
Hut. Hike.

31:32.266 --> 31:34.767
I got him. I got him.

31:34.935 --> 31:36.561
There we go.
That's twice this year.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.521
- Whoo!
- (Murphy coughing)

31:40.774 --> 31:43.943
Who's skinny now, huh?
Whoo!

31:44.111 --> 31:45.778
Dwight: Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

31:45.946 --> 31:47.738
(groaning, hacking)

31:47.906 --> 31:49.115
Are you all right?

31:49.283 --> 31:51.867
- Man: He was too big, huh?
- Man #2: What were you thinking?

31:52.035 --> 31:53.911
Nice job, Pearson,
you dummy.

31:54.079 --> 31:56.414
Hey, are you okay?

31:58.041 --> 31:59.917
That one felt real, Coach.

32:00.085 --> 32:02.962
Damn right it's real.
Keep moving like a pregnant goat,

32:03.130 --> 32:04.880
you won't last three downs
on Friday night.

32:05.048 --> 32:07.216
Cuyahoga hits 10 times harder
than Pearson.

32:07.384 --> 32:08.634
- Hey.
- They want nothing better

32:08.802 --> 32:10.678
than to get you
out of the game.

32:10.846 --> 32:12.471
You're a running quarterback
on that play.

32:12.639 --> 32:14.348
The pocket breaks down,
what do you do?

32:14.516 --> 32:15.725
- You...
- Move.

32:15.892 --> 32:17.643
Move!
Come on, let's go.

32:17.811 --> 32:19.687
All right, play football.
Let's go, boys.

32:19.855 --> 32:21.314
(men cheering)

32:21.481 --> 32:23.232
That one felt really real.

32:23.400 --> 32:26.068
Come on, D. Come on, man.

32:26.236 --> 32:28.154
- (men yelling)
- Murphy: Okay.

32:31.617 --> 32:33.367
Down!

32:33.535 --> 32:34.744
Set!

32:34.911 --> 32:37.496
Black EG! Black EG!

32:37.664 --> 32:38.998
Hike!

32:46.340 --> 32:48.382
Whoo, baby!

32:48.550 --> 32:49.925
- Whoo!
- Dwight: Bite me.

32:50.093 --> 32:52.136
- How about that, huh?
- Shut up.

32:52.304 --> 32:54.805
That's what I'm talking about.
Let's play some football.

Take it in.
Good stuff.

33:44.481 --> 33:47.316
Oh, come on, Coach, one more.
I'm just getting started.

33:47.484 --> 33:49.735
Hey, Hall, give me the ball.

33:49.903 --> 33:51.570
Where's Gig?

33:51.738 --> 33:53.989
Gig, let's run a post, all right?
You haven't had one yet.

33:54.157 --> 33:56.283
- No, come on, come on.
- That's not funny, Murphy.

33:56.451 --> 33:59.412
What's Hall doing?
Hey, let's go, baby.

33:59.579 --> 34:00.746
- Oh, man.
- What?

34:00.914 --> 34:02.331
- Snap the ball.
- Knock it off, will you?

34:02.499 --> 34:04.750
- What?
- What's wrong with you?

34:05.752 --> 34:07.420
Guys...?

34:11.174 --> 34:13.050
Hey, Coach,
can I ask you something?

34:13.217 --> 34:15.344
No, I don't know if this game's
gonna be on TV.

34:15.512 --> 34:17.096
The minute I do,
I'll let you know. Here.

34:17.264 --> 34:19.139
No, it's not that.

34:19.306 --> 34:22.016
Have you ever had a dream
that you're young again?

34:22.185 --> 34:23.686
Sure.
Almost every night.

34:23.853 --> 34:25.938
Yeah, but what if it wasn't a dream?
What if it was real?

34:26.106 --> 34:27.815
Well, that'd be something.

34:27.983 --> 34:29.984
No, no, no, Coach,
I'm serious.

34:30.152 --> 34:33.446
This isn't some kind of
life-after-death thing.

34:33.612 --> 34:35.781
We're standing here.
I'm real...

34:36.783 --> 34:38.826
you're real.

34:45.167 --> 34:47.752
Son, don't make me start
testing for drugs,

34:47.918 --> 34:51.045
not before the biggest game
this town's ever played.

34:57.094 --> 34:58.471
(girl chuckles)
Okay.

34:58.638 --> 35:00.639
Bye.
See you tomorrow.

35:03.059 --> 35:05.144
Hey, Sasha, wait up.

35:06.980 --> 35:09.440
Oh, hey...
oh my gosh.

35:09.608 --> 35:11.150
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Sasha: It's okay.

35:11.318 --> 35:14.487
- I'm sorry.
- What? What? Stop looking.

35:14.654 --> 35:16.530
I'm sorry for everything. I...

35:16.698 --> 35:19.909
Oh. I'm sorry.

35:21.828 --> 35:22.995
Macy!

35:43.141 --> 35:46.227
- Sasha: I hate that one.
- (Macy giggles)

35:48.480 --> 35:50.773
Hey, let's get inside
while there's still hot water.

35:51.775 --> 35:53.526
Let's go.

35:58.198 --> 35:59.532
Murphy:
Todd.

36:01.451 --> 36:03.035
Hey, want a ride?

36:03.203 --> 36:05.412
The last time you offered me a ride,
I ended up

36:05.580 --> 36:08.290
hanging from a hook in the girls'
locker room by my underwear.

36:09.292 --> 36:10.960
That was a long time ago.

36:11.127 --> 36:13.003
That was last Tuesday.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.755
Todd?

36:14.923 --> 36:17.383
Stop torturing the dorks.

36:17.551 --> 36:19.218
(chuckles)

36:20.220 --> 36:21.637
- Murphy: Whoa.
- Jenny: Let's talk about

36:21.805 --> 36:23.806
how great next year
is gonna be.

36:33.441 --> 36:35.901
So my dad said
that Coach Cooper

36:36.069 --> 36:37.903
told the head of
the alumni association

36:38.071 --> 36:40.447
that you are going to start
next year.

36:40.615 --> 36:41.740
(chuckles)

36:41.908 --> 36:43.492
You know what that means?

36:43.660 --> 36:45.911
No redshirt year,
so you can go pro sooner.

36:46.079 --> 36:47.663
And I'll take extra credits

36:47.831 --> 36:49.623
so that I can graduate early
and go with you.

36:49.791 --> 36:52.835
And I'll just get a TV job
wherever you end up playing.

36:53.003 --> 36:54.879
I have it all planned.

36:55.046 --> 36:57.047
It'll be perfect.

37:00.385 --> 37:04.430
What if that plan changes?
What if I get hurt?

37:04.598 --> 37:06.015
Don't talk like that.

37:06.182 --> 37:08.601
You're not gonna get hurt.
You're the best.

37:08.768 --> 37:11.103
Scotty, you just passed
my house.

37:11.271 --> 37:13.647
Murphy:
Yeah, right. I forgot.

37:20.906 --> 37:24.116
So...

37:24.284 --> 37:26.702
my parents aren't home
right now.

37:26.870 --> 37:30.331
And I know how you get tense
before a big game,

37:30.498 --> 37:32.583
so...

37:32.751 --> 37:34.919
I thought maybe...

37:35.086 --> 37:37.129
- Uh...
- Come on.

37:37.297 --> 37:39.423
I can't.

37:39.591 --> 37:41.717
Sorry.

37:41.885 --> 37:43.969
All right, well,
I can wait till Saturday.

37:45.722 --> 37:49.558
Oh, and don't forget to tell your mom
about the recruiter visit on Thursday.

37:49.726 --> 37:51.727
Jenny:
Okay.

37:54.105 --> 37:55.773
Bye.

37:59.152 --> 38:01.487
My mom.

38:38.984 --> 38:41.110
(engine stops)

38:46.116 --> 38:47.700
Biscuit.

38:47.867 --> 38:49.451
Hey, old buddy.

38:49.619 --> 38:51.036
Hey.

38:51.204 --> 38:53.998
- Look at you. Oh.
- (Biscuit whines)

38:54.165 --> 38:55.165
(door opens)

38:55.333 --> 38:58.502
Stop messing with the dog
and go get your dinner.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.337
It's getting cold.

39:02.465 --> 39:04.133
(softly)
Mom...

39:10.223 --> 39:12.224
Always late,
just like your father.

39:12.392 --> 39:13.726
Mom.

39:13.893 --> 39:15.310
Whoa.

39:15.478 --> 39:17.229
Hey.
(chuckles)

39:17.397 --> 39:19.273
All right, come on, come on.
You're gonna make me late.

39:19.441 --> 39:21.233
Let's go.

39:22.235 --> 39:24.737
You look so beautiful, Mom.

39:24.904 --> 39:26.822
(laughs)
Get out of here.

39:26.990 --> 39:28.699
Mom, wait.

39:28.867 --> 39:30.826
- Why don't you call in sick?
- Oh, yeah.

39:30.994 --> 39:32.911
- Let's stay in and watch old movies.
- Sure, sure, no problem.

39:33.079 --> 39:34.997
Hey, skedaddle. Go.
I'm late.

39:35.165 --> 39:36.957
Come on, Mom.

39:37.125 --> 39:40.085
Just please stay.
Take the night off.

39:42.338 --> 39:44.214
Not until my numbers hit,
sweetheart.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.050
(engine starts)

39:50.388 --> 39:52.389
(whispers)
They never did.

41:00.750 --> 41:02.876
Yo, Murphy.

41:06.214 --> 41:08.507
Hey, what are you doing?

41:08.675 --> 41:10.843
I've never really
read these before.

41:11.010 --> 41:13.011
I could go
to all these places...

41:13.179 --> 41:16.223
Notre Dame, Penn State,
California, Florida.

41:16.391 --> 41:17.808
I could go to Hawaii.

41:17.976 --> 41:20.102
Hawaii?
They suck at football.

41:20.270 --> 41:22.771
Besides, you already
verbally committed to Ohio State.

41:22.939 --> 41:26.108
And hey, do me a favor...

41:26.276 --> 41:28.193
stop pissing off Coach
at practice.

41:28.361 --> 41:30.529
I need you playing
Friday night.

41:30.697 --> 41:32.781
I mean, realistically I know
we're probably gonna lose,

41:32.949 --> 41:35.200
but I need to have
a good game.

41:37.036 --> 41:38.412
You don't think
we can win?

41:38.580 --> 41:40.998
Read the papers, man.
No one does.

41:41.166 --> 41:44.168
They're saying we'll be lucky
to get off the field in one piece.

41:45.461 --> 41:47.212
Are we going running
or what?

41:47.380 --> 41:49.381
Run?
We just had practice.

41:49.549 --> 41:51.216
You don't want to run...
I don't want to run.

41:51.384 --> 41:53.594
I don't know why you like
freaking running so much anyway.

41:53.761 --> 41:56.513
- (turns on TV)
- It helps me clear my head.

41:56.681 --> 41:59.391
Whatever. You got a new antenna
for this piece yet?

41:59.559 --> 42:01.768
Who's faster?
Me or you?

42:01.936 --> 42:03.562
I don't know.
Probably me.

42:03.730 --> 42:05.564
Well, come on.
Let's find out.

42:08.151 --> 42:10.027
Hall:
What, you want to race?

42:10.195 --> 42:11.904
Till Tessier's farm.

42:12.071 --> 42:13.864
Come on, man.
I want to know.

42:14.032 --> 42:16.325
Do you really think we should
overexert ourselves right now?

42:16.492 --> 42:17.868
What, are you scared?

42:18.036 --> 42:19.411
No.

42:19.579 --> 42:21.079
No, man, you know what?

42:21.247 --> 42:23.415
I got some trig homework to do,
so I think I'm just gonna head out.

42:23.583 --> 42:26.585
Go! Sucker!

42:38.973 --> 42:41.934
Okay, you beat me.

43:46.499 --> 43:49.126
Oh, I need to talk to Miss Cunningham
about my article.

43:49.294 --> 43:51.003
I'll be two minutes.

43:53.631 --> 43:56.383
- Hey, Murphy.
- Scott.

44:14.861 --> 44:18.113
- Here, let me help you.
- No, I got it. I got it.

44:20.199 --> 44:22.701
- Here.
- Thank you.

44:26.789 --> 44:28.707
So...

44:30.543 --> 44:33.545
do you even know
who I am?

44:36.758 --> 44:40.010
Um, of course I know
who you are.

44:41.637 --> 44:45.098
You're the guy who spray-painted
the band locker room last year.

44:46.726 --> 44:49.394
We spent spring break
trying to clean it.

44:49.562 --> 44:50.562
Thanks.

44:50.730 --> 44:52.856
Next time you get the urge
to spray words onto something,

44:53.024 --> 44:54.816
could you try
spelling them right?

44:54.984 --> 44:57.152
You know,
maybe bring a dictionary

44:57.320 --> 44:59.738
or practice on some paper
with your crayons first?

45:02.700 --> 45:03.867
She...

45:05.370 --> 45:07.954
(school bell rings)

45:08.956 --> 45:12.084
Hand: All right, guys, come on in here.
Let's take a knee.

45:12.251 --> 45:14.544
Okay, a little business first.

45:14.712 --> 45:16.880
I got some good news
and some bad news.

45:17.048 --> 45:18.423
The bad news is

45:18.591 --> 45:20.884
we're not gonna be playing
in Columbus on Friday night.

45:21.052 --> 45:22.844
Players:
What? Why?

45:23.012 --> 45:26.056
Ohio Stadium went from turf
to grass last year.

45:26.224 --> 45:28.266
Since Ohio State's playing
Michigan this Saturday,

45:28.434 --> 45:29.935
we had to sell, like,
I don't know,

45:30.103 --> 45:31.645
10,000 tickets or something
to cover the green fees.

45:31.813 --> 45:34.398
We didn't sell enough tickets
to use the grass?

45:34.565 --> 45:37.484
They offered to let us play there
if we didn't bring the band.

45:37.652 --> 45:39.486
They didn't want them
messing up the field at halftime.

45:39.654 --> 45:41.113
We're not playing
'cause of the band?

45:41.280 --> 45:43.824
The band's part of our team, Pearson.
It's part of our town.

45:43.991 --> 45:46.743
If the band can't play there,
then we can't play there either.

45:46.911 --> 45:47.953
Hall:
What's the good news?

45:48.121 --> 45:50.539
The good news is we won the coin toss.
We're playing right here.

45:50.706 --> 45:53.417
That's the good news?

45:54.836 --> 45:58.004
No scout's gonna drive out here
to "Backwater."

45:58.172 --> 46:00.132
Oh, I don't know, Hall.
Maybe not quite as many.

46:00.299 --> 46:02.300
Guys, we have
home field advantage.

46:02.468 --> 46:05.137
Yeah, some advantage.
Maybe they'll slip on a cow patty.

46:05.304 --> 46:08.473
Look, at least let's be honest.
The reason we didn't get the field

46:08.641 --> 46:10.016
is they think that
we're gonna get killed.

46:10.184 --> 46:11.518
Hand: I don't know.
You might be right.

46:11.686 --> 46:14.896
I guess you can get down
because somewhere

46:15.064 --> 46:18.191
somebody who doesn't even know you
doesn't believe in you.

46:18.359 --> 46:20.485
Or you could look around
and be happy about the fact

46:20.653 --> 46:23.071
that you're playing in front of
the hardworking people who live here...

46:23.239 --> 46:26.366
you know, be a little grateful that
those same people who do believe in you

46:26.534 --> 46:28.910
and can't afford a fancy
hotel room in the city

46:29.078 --> 46:32.164
can now come out and actually
watch your sorry ass play.

46:40.006 --> 46:41.506
Line it up.

47:00.401 --> 47:02.402
(distant whistle blows)

47:04.572 --> 47:08.450
Hey.

47:08.618 --> 47:10.076
(chuckles)

47:10.244 --> 47:12.412
I was watching you practice
back there.

47:12.580 --> 47:14.831
I never really knew how complicated
those moves were,

47:14.999 --> 47:18.043
like running for a touchdown
and playing music at the same time.

47:18.211 --> 47:20.670
No one's trying to tackle you.

47:20.838 --> 47:23.798
I don't know.
That drummer got close a few times.

47:25.218 --> 47:28.720
Murphy: You're good.
I'm surprised.

47:30.723 --> 47:32.599
Um...

47:32.767 --> 47:34.309
thanks, I guess.

47:34.477 --> 47:35.519
- Hey.
- Hey.

47:35.686 --> 47:37.771
Scotty, man, good luck Friday
at the game and all that.

47:37.939 --> 47:40.357
- Will you be at the diner tonight?
- Uh-huh.

47:40.525 --> 47:42.901
- I'm gonna come over with my folks.
- Yeah.

47:43.069 --> 47:44.110
Boy:
Yeah?

47:44.278 --> 47:46.112
Yeah. Make sure you sit
in my section.

47:46.280 --> 47:48.698
Boy:
Yeah, I will. Cool.

47:48.866 --> 47:50.659
Macy:
Yeah, okay.

47:50.826 --> 47:52.869
- Macy: Great.
- Bye. Scott.

47:53.037 --> 47:55.455
- Boy: See you.
- Macy: See you later.

47:58.793 --> 48:00.669
Is that your
high school flame?

48:02.797 --> 48:05.382
Why do you care?

48:05.550 --> 48:07.425
I...

48:07.593 --> 48:11.137
I thought you worked at the hospital
in Celina today.

48:11.305 --> 48:15.100
The hospital is volunteer

48:15.268 --> 48:17.477
and the diner pays, so I...

48:17.645 --> 48:20.313
how did you know
I worked at the hospital?

48:22.400 --> 48:24.276
Small town.

48:24.443 --> 48:26.444
Hey.

48:26.612 --> 48:28.113
We gotta go to work.
Let's go.

48:28.281 --> 48:30.699
- All right.
- Okay.

48:30.866 --> 48:32.367
- See you.
- Macy: Yeah.

48:44.171 --> 48:46.339
Dwight: Gig's mom called
Psychic Friends yesterday,

48:46.507 --> 48:48.341
said they thought we might
score a touchdown.

48:48.509 --> 48:50.135
Where? At Ohio Stadium?

48:50.303 --> 48:52.178
Oh, right,
we're not playing there.

48:52.346 --> 48:54.222
I just need to have
a good game,

48:54.390 --> 48:56.850
which I can't do unless you do.
No pressure.

48:57.018 --> 48:58.560
I'm sure you will.

48:58.728 --> 49:00.186
Hall:
I hope so.

49:00.354 --> 49:02.522
The last thing I want to do
is spend the rest of my life

49:02.690 --> 49:05.191
here in Backwater

49:05.359 --> 49:06.943
doing this stuff.

49:07.111 --> 49:09.404
- I'd freaking kill myself.
- (forklift beeps)

49:09.572 --> 49:11.865
(men shouting)

49:19.540 --> 49:21.041
- Hey, Mom.
- Hmm?

49:24.378 --> 49:27.839
If you had a chance
to do it all over again...

49:28.007 --> 49:30.967
your whole life...

49:31.135 --> 49:33.219
what would you do?

49:33.387 --> 49:36.097
I don't know.
Finish high school.

49:36.265 --> 49:37.932
(laughs)

49:38.100 --> 49:39.726
No, I'm serious.

49:39.894 --> 49:42.479
You would probably get
a different job, right?

49:42.647 --> 49:44.397
Live in a different town,
work less hours?

49:44.565 --> 49:46.358
No, my job is fine
and so is this town.

49:46.525 --> 49:49.069
Would you please
just eat your dinner?

49:49.236 --> 49:51.237
What's the matter
with you?

49:56.577 --> 49:58.203
What about Dad?

49:59.205 --> 50:01.206
What about him?

50:03.584 --> 50:05.752
Would you still have
married him?

50:07.421 --> 50:09.255
What are you talking about?

50:10.257 --> 50:12.676
Would you still have
married him,

50:12.843 --> 50:15.637
you know, even if

50:15.805 --> 50:18.223
you knew it wasn't gonna
work out?

50:20.518 --> 50:22.018
(exhales)

50:23.312 --> 50:25.271

The library is that way.

51:25.374 --> 51:27.876
Guys, this is a public venue
and I've got the legal right

51:28.043 --> 51:29.502
to be here under
Civil Code section 47...

51:29.670 --> 51:31.337
Sorry, freshman,
you were banned

51:31.505 --> 51:33.673
under the penalty
of extreme bodily pain.

51:33.841 --> 51:35.175
You know what?
That's cool.

51:35.342 --> 51:37.177
You know, I really...
I wasn't even that hungry anyway.

51:37.344 --> 51:39.220
And I was just coming in
for a sundae. I'm gonna go.

51:39.388 --> 51:41.264
- What's going on?
- Oh, no.

51:41.432 --> 51:44.184
Todd the Rod
tried to break the ban.

51:44.351 --> 51:46.519
Listen, I wasn't sure
if that applied to all nights

51:46.687 --> 51:48.563
or if it was just a weekends thing,
but now I know.

51:48.731 --> 51:50.106
Who banned him?

51:51.358 --> 51:53.818
Who the hell banned him?

51:53.986 --> 51:55.695
You did, man.

51:56.822 --> 51:58.281
Oh.

51:59.325 --> 52:01.159
Yeah, well,
he's unbanned now.

52:01.327 --> 52:03.495
He's helping me out with something,
so leave him alone.

52:03.662 --> 52:05.789
Let's go, Todd.

52:05.956 --> 52:08.625
- See you, ladies.
- Dwight: Wow.

52:11.921 --> 52:13.421
(bell dings)

52:13.589 --> 52:15.632
Sasha:
Yo, 86 chicken fried steak.

52:15.800 --> 52:17.175
Girl:
Hi, Scotty.

52:17.343 --> 52:18.718
- Hey.
- Hmm?

52:18.886 --> 52:20.386
Right here.

52:25.226 --> 52:28.394
Man: Make that milkshake
extra wet.

52:29.563 --> 52:31.231
You seriously want
to eat with me?

52:31.398 --> 52:32.982
Murphy: Yeah.
Get what you want.

52:33.150 --> 52:36.110
If I remember correctly,
you get free ice cream.

52:36.278 --> 52:38.696
Uh, no. I can't.

52:38.864 --> 52:41.241
I'm allergic to milk.

52:41.408 --> 52:43.076
If you're allergic to milk,

52:43.244 --> 52:45.578
why would you risk your life
coming here for a sundae?

52:45.746 --> 52:47.956
Sasha: Move it, pixies.
We're working here.

52:48.123 --> 52:50.124
Todd:
Well...

52:50.292 --> 52:52.460
Sasha: I need two fries
on a rail.

52:55.673 --> 52:56.798
You like Sasha?

52:56.966 --> 52:59.926
What?
No. No.

53:00.094 --> 53:01.803
That's crazy.

53:01.971 --> 53:03.972
At least you don't have to worry
about any competition.

53:04.139 --> 53:05.306
Hey, Sasha.

53:05.474 --> 53:07.350
Sasha: Shut it, lawn jockey.
You're not in my section.

53:07.518 --> 53:08.935
Hey, what are you
doing, man?

53:09.103 --> 53:10.687
Sasha: Beth, your section is bugging me.
Take care of them.

53:10.855 --> 53:12.313
The direct approach
does not work with her.

53:12.481 --> 53:14.816
I promise you, your way is gonna take
at least 20 years.

53:14.984 --> 53:17.110
- Sasha.
- No, no, no, please.

53:17.278 --> 53:19.612
- Sasha. Sasha.
- Please don't. Don't.

53:19.780 --> 53:22.448
I didn't come here
to talk to her.

53:22.616 --> 53:24.576
Well, then why the hell
are you here?

53:24.743 --> 53:26.619
I don't know. Just...

53:26.787 --> 53:29.122
just to watch her, I guess.

53:34.211 --> 53:36.337
Listen, I heard that
some of the diner girls

53:36.505 --> 53:38.673
go to Butler Pond
and skinny-dip after work.

53:38.841 --> 53:41.301
Yeah, well, Martha Lotte and Beth Lane
would take it off for anybody.

53:41.468 --> 53:44.429
- No, not them.
- Who? Sasha?

53:44.597 --> 53:46.472
Yeah, her and Macy Edwards.

53:48.309 --> 53:49.392
What?

53:49.560 --> 53:52.478
Look, I'm into Sasha, but if you
want in, I brought binoculars.

53:52.646 --> 53:54.272
I heard some of
the band guys talking.

53:54.440 --> 53:56.316
They said that Macy has
really nice...

53:56.483 --> 53:58.276
(tray crashes)

53:58.444 --> 54:00.778
- (applause)
- I'm sorry.

54:00.946 --> 54:03.448
- Man: Smooth move.
- Macy: You guys doing all right?

54:03.616 --> 54:05.658
(girls, boys giggling)

54:05.826 --> 54:07.327
Girl:
Oh my God.

54:07.494 --> 54:09.037
Boy:
Psych.

54:09.204 --> 54:10.747
See? I told you.

54:10.915 --> 54:13.166
They're just sitting there.
Macy doesn't skinny-dip.

54:13.334 --> 54:15.585
Let's get out of here. I feel stupid
sitting here spying on them.

54:15.753 --> 54:17.503
Wait.

54:17.671 --> 54:19.213
Wait a minute.

54:20.925 --> 54:22.508
My God,
they're coming off.

54:22.676 --> 54:24.010
What?

54:27.848 --> 54:29.140
(engine starts)

54:31.644 --> 54:33.353
(girls yelp)

54:35.522 --> 54:37.565
(laughing)

54:37.733 --> 54:40.026
Macy: Okay, you can
turn around now.

54:40.194 --> 54:42.278
Boy: This is so awesome.
Whoa.

54:43.781 --> 54:45.657
Boy:
Is that Scott?

54:45.824 --> 54:47.325
What are you doing?

54:47.493 --> 54:49.202
- Put your clothes on.
- But we were just...

54:49.370 --> 54:51.871
No buts. Get your clothes on and get out
of here before I call your parents.

54:52.039 --> 54:53.915
- Sasha: Hey!
- Now. Go.

54:54.083 --> 54:56.292
- Boy: Relax, man.
- Macy: Norman.

54:56.460 --> 54:58.878
- Macy, what are you doing?
- Uh, swimming.

54:59.046 --> 55:00.338
You're naked,
for God's sakes.

55:00.506 --> 55:02.548
Uh, yeah, that's how
you skinny-dip, meathead.

55:04.259 --> 55:06.719
Macy Elaine, get out of this water
right now and put your clothes on.

55:06.887 --> 55:09.055
- What, are you, the swimming police?
- Hey, you, shut up.

55:09.223 --> 55:11.516
Macy, come on.

55:13.727 --> 55:15.561
Sasha: What am I supposed to do...
just get out naked?

55:15.729 --> 55:17.313
No. God, please don't.

55:17.481 --> 55:19.565
(car engine starts)

55:19.733 --> 55:21.734
- You could catch a cold out here.
- Okay, I got it.

55:21.902 --> 55:23.778
Not to mention
it's a school night.

55:23.946 --> 55:26.239
Macy: Come on.

55:27.574 --> 55:29.242
Is this what you do
in your spare time...

55:29.410 --> 55:31.452
get naked together?
What the hell are you doing here?

55:31.620 --> 55:33.621
What the hell
are you doing here?

55:33.789 --> 55:36.082
That's none
of your business.

55:36.250 --> 55:38.918
It's none of my business?
You show up here yelling,

55:39.086 --> 55:41.838
you scare our friends away,
and it's none of my business?

55:42.006 --> 55:45.216
Yeah, well, I happened to be
sitting with my friend Todd...

55:45.384 --> 55:48.094
happ...

55:48.262 --> 55:50.179
Todd, get out here.

55:53.892 --> 55:56.561
Todd, get out here now
or you die.

56:02.067 --> 56:04.193
Hi. Hello.

56:05.279 --> 56:07.030
Hello. Hi.

56:10.617 --> 56:14.120
Todd... Sasha.
Sasha... Todd.

56:14.288 --> 56:17.457
I... I sat behind you
in Civics.

56:17.624 --> 56:20.084
You always came in at the bell
because you had gym right before

56:20.252 --> 56:22.211
and you had to shower.
You never had any makeup on

56:22.379 --> 56:24.172
so I could always see
your freckles.

56:24.339 --> 56:26.466
And your hair was always wet,
kind of like now.

56:31.221 --> 56:33.890
So since when do you hang out
with this bonehead?

56:34.058 --> 56:36.934
Oh, I... you know,
I don't even know this guy that well.

56:37.102 --> 56:38.978
You know, I was helping him
with some schoolwork.

56:39.146 --> 56:40.730
We were just studying.

56:40.898 --> 56:43.441
With binoculars?

56:45.444 --> 56:46.694
You know what?
He likes Macy

56:46.862 --> 56:48.738
and he was afraid that she
might be skinny-dipping.

56:48.906 --> 56:50.823
What? He likes Sasha
and was spying on her at the diner.

56:50.991 --> 56:53.034
- No, I think you were spying on Macy.
- I wanted ice cream.

56:53.202 --> 56:55.495
- I wanted some ice cream too.
- You're lactose-intolerant.

56:55.662 --> 56:58.164
- (guys scream)
- (girls laugh)

57:03.879 --> 57:06.172
Murphy:
It's freezing!

57:06.340 --> 57:08.508
I thought you were
supposed to be

57:08.675 --> 57:10.760
a big, tough football guy.

57:10.928 --> 57:14.013
I thought you were supposed to be
an innocent little band girl.

57:14.181 --> 57:17.183
- You learn something new every day.
- Now is this supposed to be fun?

57:17.351 --> 57:19.018
Because I feel like
we're all gonna get hypothermia.

57:19.186 --> 57:21.062
Sasha: Oh, relax.
You'll get used to it.

57:21.230 --> 57:23.106
(Todd yelps)

57:24.108 --> 57:26.109
Oh, my.

57:27.694 --> 57:29.529
Sasha: I like your binoculars.
They're really cool.

57:29.696 --> 57:31.781
Macy: Take your time
drying those...

57:33.158 --> 57:35.201
so they can talk.

57:40.124 --> 57:42.458
Sasha:
Can I have these?

57:48.048 --> 57:50.341
I'm playing football again.

57:50.509 --> 57:52.385
Oh.

57:52.553 --> 57:54.720
I didn't even know
you'd stopped.

57:54.888 --> 57:57.223
It's all I've ever been
good at.

58:00.602 --> 58:02.061
That's good.

58:03.063 --> 58:05.565
Seems like
you really enjoy it.

58:05.732 --> 58:07.900
More than you could
ever know.

58:08.068 --> 58:11.070
It's what's gonna get me
out of Backwater.

58:11.238 --> 58:14.907
"Backwater"? You make it sound
like it's a prison or something.

58:17.202 --> 58:20.413
Don't tell me that you don't want
to get out of here someday.

58:20.581 --> 58:22.582
No.

58:24.585 --> 58:25.960
I love it here.

58:26.128 --> 58:28.212
Why? What's there to love?

58:28.380 --> 58:31.257
So many things.
Butler Pond.

58:31.425 --> 58:32.633
Skinny-dipping?

58:32.801 --> 58:34.552
Yes, skinny-dipping.

58:36.054 --> 58:37.930
No, not just that.

58:38.098 --> 58:40.766
In the winter, you know,
when it freezes over

58:40.934 --> 58:43.936
and they have live music

58:44.104 --> 58:46.939
and everyone's out there
ice skating.

58:47.107 --> 58:48.900
Oh, I love that.

58:49.067 --> 58:50.943
I go out there
and I just feel

58:51.111 --> 58:53.613
like I'm living
in an old painting.

58:54.698 --> 58:58.451
This town is small enough

58:58.619 --> 59:02.955
that you feel like
you're one giant family, but...

59:05.459 --> 59:06.876
it's big enough

59:07.044 --> 59:11.881
that someone you thought
was one way...

59:13.675 --> 59:15.801
is entirely different

59:15.969 --> 59:18.054
once you get to know them
a little.

59:25.145 --> 59:28.147
And that's what I love
about Coldwater.

59:37.866 --> 59:40.201
Things are gonna be
different now, Macy.

59:42.162 --> 59:43.704
I'm going to college.

59:43.872 --> 59:46.249
And I'm gonna play football.

59:46.416 --> 59:48.709
When I go pro, they're gonna pay me
a lot of money.

59:48.877 --> 59:50.670
Hmm.

59:50.837 --> 59:53.881
That's great, good for you.

59:54.049 --> 59:57.260
No, not just good for me.
It's good for you.

59:59.054 --> 01:00:01.639
Macy, I can take you
with me.

01:00:01.807 --> 01:00:03.641
I can get us out of here.

01:00:06.853 --> 01:00:09.438
Do girls really fall
for that crap?

01:00:10.774 --> 01:00:13.859
Here. Ugh.

01:00:14.027 --> 01:00:15.611
Gosh, I guess
you get used to it.

01:00:15.779 --> 01:00:17.530
What? Used to what?

01:00:17.698 --> 01:00:19.031
Everything coming
so easy.

01:00:19.199 --> 01:00:21.701
Nothing in my life
has ever come easy.

01:00:21.868 --> 01:00:24.203
What do you want, Macy?
You want to live out of a trailer,

01:00:24.371 --> 01:00:27.290
barely scraping by here in Coldwater
the rest of your life?

01:00:29.251 --> 01:00:31.168
I'm...

01:00:32.421 --> 01:00:34.088
who cares where I live?

01:00:34.256 --> 01:00:35.715
And you know what?

01:00:35.882 --> 01:00:38.551
If I do, God forbid,
end up in a trailer,

01:00:38.719 --> 01:00:41.887
then I'm sure I'm gonna be
a lot happier than you are

01:00:42.055 --> 01:00:45.266
in some big mansion.

01:00:45.434 --> 01:00:47.184
Hey, I wouldn't bet on it.

01:00:47.352 --> 01:00:49.020
- Sasha: See you.
- Sasha, can we go?

01:00:49.187 --> 01:00:51.564
Murphy: In fact, I'm pretty positive
we're gonna be quite miserable.

01:00:51.732 --> 01:00:54.025
- Sasha: Loser.
- Wait. Wait. I'm not with him.

01:00:54.192 --> 01:00:56.068
I mean, we're not
really friends.

01:00:56.236 --> 01:00:58.029
Murphy:
Todd.

01:00:58.196 --> 01:01:01.449
(car doors slam,
engine starts)

01:01:05.287 --> 01:01:07.413
Murphy: Who the hell
does she think she is?

01:01:07.581 --> 01:01:10.916
I mean, besides,
I have the prettiest girlfriend

01:01:11.084 --> 01:01:12.877
in town, in the state... Jenny.

01:01:13.045 --> 01:01:15.338
She's beautiful.
She's smart. She's amazing.

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:18.424
She's... she's coordinated.

01:01:18.592 --> 01:01:20.926
You know, we were naked
in the same water.

01:01:21.094 --> 01:01:23.554
All I've ever wanted to do
was play football.

01:01:23.722 --> 01:01:27.141
And now I have a chance to do it again
and I'm not giving it up.

01:01:27.309 --> 01:01:29.310
That means the water
that touched her naked

01:01:29.478 --> 01:01:31.395
touched me naked.

01:01:31.563 --> 01:01:34.857
I'm getting out of here, Todd.
I don't care what it takes.

01:01:37.402 --> 01:01:40.154
(school bell rings)

01:01:41.156 --> 01:01:43.616
So what do you want to do?

01:01:43.784 --> 01:01:47.703
Well, maybe we could
get some ice cream.

01:01:47.871 --> 01:01:49.872
I don't know.

01:01:50.957 --> 01:01:53.459
Red 18! Red 18! Hike!

01:01:57.089 --> 01:01:58.672
- Argh!
- (whistle blows)

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:00.800
Murph, man, what the hell
just happened?

01:02:00.967 --> 01:02:02.385
- Man: Come on, Gig.
- Why the hell did you throw it to me?

01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:03.677
You don't never
throw it to me.

01:02:03.845 --> 01:02:04.970
Man: Relax, Gig.
You'll catch one someday.

01:02:05.138 --> 01:02:06.931
Since when does he start
throwing it to me, man?

01:02:07.099 --> 01:02:08.891
I signed up for the ladies,
not to get hit.

01:02:25.659 --> 01:02:27.743
- Hey, Mom.
- Sit down.

01:02:27.911 --> 01:02:29.078
Sit!

01:02:30.914 --> 01:02:32.415
Is everything okay?

01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:34.625
I put in 14 hours
last night,

01:02:34.793 --> 01:02:37.294
only to be woken up
by Todd White's mother

01:02:37.462 --> 01:02:39.755
telling me how you are
tormenting her son now

01:02:39.923 --> 01:02:42.591
and keeping him up all hours
of the night. Is that right?

01:02:42.759 --> 01:02:45.511
- Well, it wasn't quite like that.
- I don't care what it was like.

01:02:45.679 --> 01:02:48.097
I raised you better than this.
You're grounded, buster.

01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:50.558
- I'm grounded?
- Oh, this is funny to you?

01:02:50.725 --> 01:02:52.560
You are grounded,
do you hear me?

01:02:52.727 --> 01:02:54.395
- Hey, Thelma. Sorry I'm...
- Grounded.

01:02:54.563 --> 01:02:57.565
- Listen, I'll come right back.
- No, no, no. Actually, I'm done.

01:02:57.732 --> 01:03:00.693
It's your turn. Maybe you can
talk some sense into him.

01:03:00.861 --> 01:03:02.194
I doubt it, but I'll try.

01:03:02.362 --> 01:03:05.364
You'd better do more than that,
or you're both grounded.

01:03:08.076 --> 01:03:09.702
All right,
what did you do?

01:03:10.704 --> 01:03:12.121
Nothing.

01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:14.039
- (car engine starts)
- What's this?

01:03:14.207 --> 01:03:16.041
Double-shift Wednesdays.

01:03:16.209 --> 01:03:18.961
Since you're grounded, I don't think
you got anything better to do.

01:03:19.129 --> 01:03:21.005
I forgot we did this.

01:03:22.716 --> 01:03:24.425
All right.

01:03:24.593 --> 01:03:27.136
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:03:27.304 --> 01:03:29.305
They're both for you.

01:03:31.475 --> 01:03:33.350
I'm pretty good at opening
those myself

01:03:33.518 --> 01:03:36.020
and usually one at a time.

01:03:36.188 --> 01:03:38.689
All right, grab some plates.

01:03:38.857 --> 01:03:40.733
- How did it go with Crystal?
- Oh, it was great.

01:03:40.901 --> 01:03:43.986
We talked her out of her depression
and back into her rut.

01:03:44.154 --> 01:03:45.404
(audience laughter)

01:03:45.572 --> 01:03:47.740
Coach Cooper said
I could start next year.

01:03:47.908 --> 01:03:49.909
That means
I can go pro sooner.

01:03:50.076 --> 01:03:52.286
Finish school.

01:03:52.454 --> 01:03:54.580
I can finish school
when I retire.

01:03:54.748 --> 01:03:58.125
I just gotta start making money
so my mom could quit working so much.

01:03:58.293 --> 01:04:00.169
I got my full ride
out of here.

01:04:00.337 --> 01:04:02.379
I just want to make sure
I get her out of Backwater too.

01:04:02.547 --> 01:04:05.049
What have I told you
about that, huh?

01:04:06.384 --> 01:04:09.053
This town raised you.
Now show it some respect.

01:04:09.221 --> 01:04:11.096
It's Coldwater with a "C."

01:04:11.264 --> 01:04:13.349
I'm just saying
I could get her out of here.

01:04:13.517 --> 01:04:16.101
And I could get you out of here too
if you want.

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:18.646
I'm fine right where I am.

01:04:18.813 --> 01:04:20.272
No, I'm serious.

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:22.399
I could ask Ohio State
to hire you

01:04:22.567 --> 01:04:24.818
as offensive coordinator
or quarterback coach.

01:04:24.986 --> 01:04:26.445
(chuckles)

01:04:26.613 --> 01:04:29.782
Well, I appreciate that,
"Big Time."

01:04:29.950 --> 01:04:32.243
Really I do.

01:04:33.954 --> 01:04:35.621
But the truth is

01:04:35.789 --> 01:04:38.374
Ohio State's already
offered me a job.

01:04:40.085 --> 01:04:42.795
What? When?

01:04:44.172 --> 01:04:46.632
Hand:
Well, let's see...

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:49.843
'83, when they wanted Yeager

01:04:50.011 --> 01:04:52.555
and then '84
when we won the sectionals

01:04:52.722 --> 01:04:56.642
and, yeah, pretty much
every year since then.

01:04:57.811 --> 01:04:59.812
How come
you didn't take it?

01:05:04.317 --> 01:05:07.278
Eh, they got plenty of coaches
at Ohio State.

01:05:09.406 --> 01:05:11.532
Did you finish
all your homework tonight?

01:05:12.534 --> 01:05:14.159
Forget about it.

01:05:14.327 --> 01:05:17.329
You know,
when I was your age

01:05:17.497 --> 01:05:19.665
I really was just like you.

01:05:19.833 --> 01:05:22.585
I couldn't wait
to leave this town.

01:05:22.752 --> 01:05:25.713
Then when I finally did
get out,

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:28.007
saw what I saw

01:05:28.174 --> 01:05:31.010
and did what I did,

01:05:31.177 --> 01:05:33.012
well, I...

01:05:33.179 --> 01:05:35.973
I couldn't run back here
fast enough.

01:05:41.187 --> 01:05:44.315
You know, Scott,

01:05:44.482 --> 01:05:47.776
this little town

01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:50.237
really is special.

01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:54.158
One day I hope
you realize that.

01:05:56.703 --> 01:05:58.370
See you tomorrow, son.

01:06:05.003 --> 01:06:07.421
(school bell rings)

01:06:07.589 --> 01:06:09.632
Game's gonna be
on TV, boys.

01:06:10.717 --> 01:06:13.344
The "Sports Illustrated" guy
came in this morning.

01:06:13.511 --> 01:06:15.387
Macy: Would you sign
the petition?

01:06:15.555 --> 01:06:16.764
It's for the band.

01:06:16.931 --> 01:06:19.600
Oh...!
Oh my gosh. Oh.

01:06:19.768 --> 01:06:21.352
Boy:
Look out.

01:06:21.519 --> 01:06:22.895
Macy:
I am so sorry.

01:06:23.063 --> 01:06:26.357
Um, hey, while I have you,

01:06:26.524 --> 01:06:28.525
would you sign?
It's for the band.

01:06:28.693 --> 01:06:30.569
Drop dead.

01:06:34.908 --> 01:06:37.951
Macy:
Hey, thanks.

01:06:40.038 --> 01:06:42.414
- I've got it.
- What are you doing?

01:06:42.582 --> 01:06:44.875
Oh, it's just a petition...

01:06:45.043 --> 01:06:47.086
you know,
trying to save the band.

01:06:47.253 --> 01:06:49.338
How many do you have?

01:06:49.506 --> 01:06:52.174
I have four.

01:06:52.342 --> 01:06:54.259
What, pages?

01:06:54.427 --> 01:06:57.262
No. No, like, people.

01:06:57.430 --> 01:07:00.724
The band's
not quite as popular

01:07:00.892 --> 01:07:02.893
as football, so...

01:07:03.978 --> 01:07:05.521
Oh, thanks.

01:07:05.689 --> 01:07:08.565
Hey, save the band.
Save the band.

01:07:08.733 --> 01:07:10.609
Everybody sign this.

01:07:10.777 --> 01:07:12.611
- Girl: Save the band.
- Murphy: Save the band.

01:07:12.779 --> 01:07:14.488
Everybody pass one around,
sign it.

01:07:14.656 --> 01:07:16.365
The football team can't play
without the band.

01:07:16.533 --> 01:07:18.617
- Boy: Scotty wants us to save the band.
- Take one right there.

01:07:18.785 --> 01:07:20.869
Sign it.
Pass one around.

01:07:21.037 --> 01:07:22.788
You guys got one
right over here?

01:07:22.956 --> 01:07:25.791
Hey, there's some more.
Pass them around.

01:07:25.959 --> 01:07:28.210
The football team can't play
without the band.

01:07:32.757 --> 01:07:34.258
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:07:34.426 --> 01:07:36.802
Jenny:
Scotty.

01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:39.138
What are you doing?

01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:42.307
Come on, let's go.

01:07:42.475 --> 01:07:44.560
Great. Thank you.

01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:58.991
(crows cawing)

01:08:00.118 --> 01:08:01.493
Hand:
And because of that,

01:08:01.661 --> 01:08:04.121
they've got the number one
secondary in the nation.

01:08:04.289 --> 01:08:06.665
Eight of their starting
11 defensemen

01:08:06.833 --> 01:08:09.001
all have full rides
to D1 schools.

01:08:09.169 --> 01:08:10.753
For all intents
and purposes, guys,

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:13.005
you're playing a college team
Friday...

01:08:13.173 --> 01:08:15.007
a pretty good one.

01:08:15.175 --> 01:08:17.468
And they hit hard.

01:08:17.635 --> 01:08:20.179
They're gonna try and do
everything they can

01:08:20.345 --> 01:08:22.389
to get Scott Murphy
out of the game.

01:08:22.557 --> 01:08:24.308
It goes without saying, boys,

01:08:24.475 --> 01:08:27.352
we've got to protect
our quarterback.

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.395
(light switch clicks)

01:08:29.564 --> 01:08:32.899
But it's gonna be our field.

01:08:34.402 --> 01:08:37.404
If we play together,

01:08:37.572 --> 01:08:39.865
I think we can beat
these guys.

01:08:41.576 --> 01:08:44.368
Now go home, tell your parents
you love them, and get some sleep.

01:08:44.537 --> 01:08:46.037
What about practice?

01:08:47.122 --> 01:08:48.832
That was practice.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.460
(players murmuring)

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:03.221
Thelma:
Oh, here you go.

01:09:03.389 --> 01:09:07.225
So I heard Penn State and Notre Dame
are still coming around.

01:09:07.393 --> 01:09:10.062
I hope you're still excited
about being a Buckeye.

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:11.647
Yes.

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:13.899
I'm definitely going
to Ohio State.

01:09:14.067 --> 01:09:16.276
I want to be close
to my mom.

01:09:16.444 --> 01:09:17.569
Jenny:
Aww.

01:09:17.737 --> 01:09:19.571
Well, let me just
thank Thelma now

01:09:19.738 --> 01:09:21.113
for keeping her son
close to home.

01:09:21.282 --> 01:09:22.866
You don't have to go
nowhere for me.

01:09:23.033 --> 01:09:25.493
Go where you want
to go, okay?

01:09:25.662 --> 01:09:27.037
Yeah, but don't you want him
in Columbus

01:09:27.205 --> 01:09:28.997
so you can come
see him play?

01:09:32.752 --> 01:09:35.754
She doesn't watch his games.
She's never seen him play.

01:09:38.258 --> 01:09:39.633
You've never
seen him play?

01:09:39.801 --> 01:09:41.844
- Huh-uh.
- She works nights.

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:44.345
Well, Thelma,
you gotta come see him play,

01:09:44.514 --> 01:09:46.890
'cause he will make you
so proud.

01:09:48.059 --> 01:09:50.685
I'm already proud of him.

01:09:55.733 --> 01:09:58.277
Pass the pepper, please.

01:10:00.488 --> 01:10:01.947
Whew.

01:10:02.115 --> 01:10:03.782
Thank your mom for me again,
would you?

01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:05.409
Yeah.

01:10:05.577 --> 01:10:07.828
Do me a favor,

01:10:07.996 --> 01:10:10.247
take it easy on Cuyahoga
tomorrow night, all right?

01:10:10.415 --> 01:10:12.749
Some of those guys are gonna be
your future teammates.

01:10:12.917 --> 01:10:15.210
I was kind of hoping
they would take it easy on me.

01:10:15.378 --> 01:10:17.421
Yeah, me too.

01:10:17.589 --> 01:10:19.798
Listen, your linemen...
they play hard.

01:10:19.966 --> 01:10:22.175
They do. They...
and they play with heart.

01:10:22.343 --> 01:10:24.303
But, son, they're not gonna be able
to protect you

01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:26.555
worth a damn tomorrow night.

01:10:26.723 --> 01:10:28.724
Yeah, I know.

01:10:29.726 --> 01:10:31.268
Listen to me.

01:10:31.436 --> 01:10:33.312
We are sold on you.

01:10:33.479 --> 01:10:35.647
We don't need to see you play
any more football.

01:10:35.815 --> 01:10:38.692
And if you want to sit this game out
tomorrow night,

01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:41.695
we're not gonna
fault you for it one bit.

01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:48.368
Thanks again.
And whatever you decide,

01:10:48.536 --> 01:10:50.245
good luck.

01:10:50.413 --> 01:10:52.164
Thanks, Coach.

01:10:58.129 --> 01:11:00.464
Jenny: I can't wait for us
to get out of here together.

01:11:15.647 --> 01:11:18.148
(rooster crows,
cows mooing)

01:11:23.696 --> 01:11:25.697
(mooing,
chickens clucking)

01:11:30.828 --> 01:11:33.121
Hey, Macy.

01:11:34.582 --> 01:11:37.668
What are you doing here?
My dad will kill you if he sees you.

01:11:37.835 --> 01:11:39.544
I really need to talk to you.

01:11:39.712 --> 01:11:41.505
It's important.

01:11:42.507 --> 01:11:45.050
Okay, just come in here.

01:11:46.344 --> 01:11:48.261
Thanks for helping
with the petition.

01:11:50.014 --> 01:11:52.057
Pretty much the whole school
signed it.

01:11:52.225 --> 01:11:54.267
So I guess we're even?

01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:56.895
For the band room?

01:11:57.063 --> 01:11:59.064
Yeah.

01:12:02.276 --> 01:12:04.695
So...

01:12:04.862 --> 01:12:07.322
what's so important?

01:12:08.908 --> 01:12:10.909
Us.

01:12:11.911 --> 01:12:13.620
What...?

01:12:13.788 --> 01:12:17.207
What are you talking about?
You have a girlfriend.

01:12:17.375 --> 01:12:19.543
Yeah, but I don't marry her.

01:12:19.711 --> 01:12:21.294
I marry you.

01:12:21.462 --> 01:12:22.587
You marry me?

01:12:22.755 --> 01:12:25.090
You don't even know me.

01:12:25.258 --> 01:12:27.175
I do know you, Macy,

01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:29.219
better than you can
ever imagine.

01:12:29.387 --> 01:12:32.597
Come on.
Did your friends put you up to this?

01:12:34.559 --> 01:12:37.102
Because it is not funny.

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:41.773
(huffs)

01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:56.747
Your grandma had a cabin
in Manns Choice.

01:12:56.914 --> 01:12:58.915
You two had a game...

01:12:59.083 --> 01:13:00.959
so that if you make
your wish,

01:13:01.127 --> 01:13:03.503
you roll it up in a piece of paper
and you put it in the wall...

01:13:03.671 --> 01:13:05.797
all your wishes come true.

01:13:07.675 --> 01:13:09.801
Every year, you wished
for the same thing.

01:13:09.969 --> 01:13:12.304
When you were 14,
she passed away.

01:13:12.472 --> 01:13:14.848
And when they were tearing
the place down

01:13:15.016 --> 01:13:16.808
you came back
and you looked in the walls

01:13:16.976 --> 01:13:18.727
and all your wishes
were gone.

01:13:18.895 --> 01:13:21.688
I know what
you wish for, Macy.

01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:26.151
You wish that one day
you could buy this farm

01:13:26.319 --> 01:13:28.111
that you and your parents
work on.

01:13:28.279 --> 01:13:31.490
Macy, your wishes come true.

01:13:31.657 --> 01:13:34.743
We end up getting married
and we buy this farm.

01:13:34.911 --> 01:13:36.995
And we have two little girls
named Krista and Jamie

01:13:37.163 --> 01:13:39.498
- that we named after your aunts.
- Why are you doing this?

01:13:39.665 --> 01:13:42.125
We end up together because
I get crippled in the game tonight.

01:13:42.293 --> 01:13:44.002
- Stop it.
- But I'm gonna change things.

01:13:44.170 --> 01:13:47.005
If I don't get hurt, in a few years
I'm gonna be making money

01:13:47.173 --> 01:13:49.132
and I'll finally be able
to take care of you.

01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:51.384
Stop it.
Just stop talking

01:13:51.552 --> 01:13:54.179
and please leave me alone.

01:13:54.347 --> 01:13:57.516
Macy, stop.

01:13:58.684 --> 01:14:01.520
We tried your dream, okay?
And it didn't work out.

01:14:01.687 --> 01:14:04.689
And I'm not gonna
end up here in Coldwater

01:14:04.857 --> 01:14:06.483
with a bum leg,
a rundown farm

01:14:06.651 --> 01:14:08.401
and two kids I can barely support.
I'm not doing it again.

01:14:08.569 --> 01:14:10.946
I'm not asking you to.

01:14:13.658 --> 01:14:15.700
All I'm asking

01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:17.410
is for you to try my dream.

01:14:18.454 --> 01:14:20.997
Come to Ohio State
with me next year.

01:14:22.125 --> 01:14:24.543
What are you talking about?

01:14:25.670 --> 01:14:27.712
We were an accident.

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:30.215
We weren't supposed to
end up together.

01:14:30.383 --> 01:14:32.884
What I'm saying is,
it doesn't have to be like that.

01:14:39.392 --> 01:14:42.352
Relationships aren't accidents.

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:44.771
They're decisions.

01:14:44.939 --> 01:14:47.858
And if you made one

01:14:48.025 --> 01:14:50.152
that you're not happy with,

01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:52.654
then that is called
a mistake.

01:14:54.282 --> 01:14:56.950
So maybe you're better off
without it.

01:14:59.787 --> 01:15:01.788
Macy?

01:15:03.249 --> 01:15:06.001
Have a nice life, Scott.

01:15:07.086 --> 01:15:10.213
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

01:15:12.675 --> 01:15:14.926
Macy.

01:15:20.641 --> 01:15:22.350
Girl: Yeah, all right,
I'll let her know.

01:15:25.313 --> 01:15:27.856
Boy:
Good luck tonight, Scotty.

01:15:28.024 --> 01:15:29.649
Hand: There you go.
Thanks a lot.

01:15:29.817 --> 01:15:31.818
- Hey, Coach.
- Hey, Scotty. I have a history class.

01:15:31.986 --> 01:15:33.737
- This is important.
- Well, so are they.

01:15:33.905 --> 01:15:36.448
- This can't wait.
- (school bell rings)

01:15:36.616 --> 01:15:39.451
All right, quickly.
What is it?

01:15:43.414 --> 01:15:45.540
I can't play tonight.

01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:47.751
Oh, no. Did you hurt yourself?
What did you do?

01:15:47.919 --> 01:15:49.294
No, not yet.

01:15:49.462 --> 01:15:51.004
- You're not hurt?
- No, I'm not hurt,

01:15:51.172 --> 01:15:54.257
but if I get injured,
I could lose my scholarship.

01:15:56.844 --> 01:16:00.138
You're not playing because
you're afraid you might get hurt?

01:16:00.306 --> 01:16:03.183
Come on, Coach. We're too small
to be playing these guys.

01:16:03.351 --> 01:16:05.227
Everyone knows it.
Even you said it.

01:16:07.146 --> 01:16:09.940
Oh, well...

01:16:10.107 --> 01:16:12.317
what the hell
has happened to you?

01:16:12.485 --> 01:16:14.861
Two weeks ago,
if I had told you

01:16:15.029 --> 01:16:17.781
we were playing the Cincinnati Bengals,
you'd have felt sorry for them

01:16:17.949 --> 01:16:19.658
because of the beating you thought
you were gonna give them.

01:16:19.825 --> 01:16:22.369
And now you're telling me that we're
too small, so you're quitting?

01:16:23.829 --> 01:16:24.829
I have to.

01:16:24.997 --> 01:16:26.998
Well, what is it you want from me?
"That's fine,

01:16:27.166 --> 01:16:29.334
I understand, son.
The team will be great"?

01:16:29.502 --> 01:16:32.128
I'm not throwing my life away
for some high school football game.

01:16:32.296 --> 01:16:34.172
Coach, come on,
I have a future.

01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:36.341
Do you know
what the future is, Scott?

01:16:36.509 --> 01:16:40.303
The future is just a bunch of
what you do right now strung together.

01:16:40.471 --> 01:16:42.639
And right now all you're doing
is giving up.

01:16:42.807 --> 01:16:44.933
And trust me,
there's no future in that.

01:16:47.979 --> 01:16:49.980
Scott...

01:16:51.107 --> 01:16:53.984
I hope you don't give up
this easy in life,

01:16:54.151 --> 01:16:57.529
because it gets a hell of a lot
harder than football.

01:17:10.793 --> 01:17:12.794
Dwight:
They're here.

01:17:14.547 --> 01:17:17.299
Dwight: Lord, look at the size
of their linemen.

01:17:17.466 --> 01:17:19.551
That's a quarterback.

01:17:19.719 --> 01:17:21.511
That is their lineman.

01:17:22.722 --> 01:17:25.557
Dwight: Oh, jeez,
they're all that big.

01:17:25.725 --> 01:17:28.059
Have fun with them tonight.

01:17:29.937 --> 01:17:31.521
Damn.

01:17:40.197 --> 01:17:42.157
(sizzling)

01:17:51.375 --> 01:17:54.002
Jenny:
Your Ohio State jersey.

01:17:54.170 --> 01:17:56.546
(chuckles)
Do you like it?

01:17:56.714 --> 01:17:58.757
Yeah.

01:17:58.924 --> 01:18:00.884
I do.

01:18:01.052 --> 01:18:03.053
Thanks.

01:18:06.974 --> 01:18:09.517
Stop worrying about it.

01:18:09.685 --> 01:18:11.770
If there's even a remote chance
that you'll get hurt,

01:18:11.937 --> 01:18:13.396
don't play,
end of story.

01:18:13.564 --> 01:18:16.399
I know. I just feel like
I'm letting the whole town down.

01:18:16.567 --> 01:18:18.443
Forget about right now.

01:18:18.611 --> 01:18:21.905
Think about
your future, okay?

01:18:22.073 --> 01:18:23.948
I know you, Scotty.

01:18:24.116 --> 01:18:26.493
All you've ever wanted is
to take care of everybody, right?

01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:29.204
- Right.
- Okay, so when you go pro,

01:18:29.372 --> 01:18:31.623
you'll have enough money
to do that.

01:18:31.791 --> 01:18:34.167
No more night shifts
and double shifts for your mom,

01:18:34.335 --> 01:18:37.754
no more trailer.
You can get her a real house.

01:18:41.926 --> 01:18:43.301
- You're right.
- Mm-hmm.

01:18:43.469 --> 01:18:45.553
You should get used to that.

01:18:45.721 --> 01:18:47.639
(both chuckle)

01:19:01.278 --> 01:19:03.780
(crowd cheering)

01:19:07.159 --> 01:19:09.702
- Murphy: Sit down. I bought you dinner.
- Thelma: Are you crazy?

01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:11.329
- Sit down.
- I don't have a lot of time.

01:19:11.497 --> 01:19:13.456
Yes, you do.
You have plenty of time.

01:19:13.624 --> 01:19:16.668
Wait, wait, don't you have
a game tonight?

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:19.921
I'm not playing.

01:19:21.966 --> 01:19:23.341
You're not?

01:19:23.509 --> 01:19:25.677
Things are gonna be
different now, Mom.

01:19:25.845 --> 01:19:28.513
From this point on,
I'm gonna be taking care of you.

01:19:28.681 --> 01:19:31.474
No, you just take care of yourself.
I'm fine.

01:19:31.642 --> 01:19:34.686
No, I'm serious. Next year,
I can start living cheaply.

01:19:34.854 --> 01:19:36.729
I'll start sending you
some of my scholarship money.

01:19:36.897 --> 01:19:38.648
No, you save your money.
I don't need it.

01:19:38.816 --> 01:19:40.608
And the truck... I mean,
it's a beautiful truck,

01:19:40.776 --> 01:19:42.193
- but why don't we sell it?
- (laughs)

01:19:42.361 --> 01:19:45.029
- I can get a ride or run to school.
- Sell it? I just bought that truck.

01:19:45.197 --> 01:19:47.740
- You can buy yourself a new car.
- I don't need a new car.

01:19:47.908 --> 01:19:50.702
And I don't need you telling me
how to manage my money, so lay off.

01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:52.328
I don't need it.
It's a waste.

01:19:52.496 --> 01:19:55.832
Hey, some people spend their money
on fancy trips.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.002
Some people go gambling.
I like to spend my money...

01:19:59.170 --> 01:20:01.546
and I ain't got much...
on you.

01:20:01.714 --> 01:20:03.798
You didn't have a lot growing up
and you never complained,

01:20:03.966 --> 01:20:07.302
so I want you to have
something nice, okay?

01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:10.388
And that truck is gonna
take care of you for a long time,

01:20:10.556 --> 01:20:12.474
so just stop this talk.

01:20:12.641 --> 01:20:14.058
"Sell the truck."

01:20:14.226 --> 01:20:16.561
I'd rather you buy something
for yourself,

01:20:16.729 --> 01:20:18.521
take a vacation
or something.

01:20:18.689 --> 01:20:22.025
Things don't make me happy.
Vacations don't make me happy.

01:20:23.736 --> 01:20:25.945
You being happy
makes me happy.

01:20:26.113 --> 01:20:28.656
I am gonna be happy.
And things are gonna be different.

01:20:28.824 --> 01:20:31.534
Gonna be?
What is so wrong with right now?

01:20:31.702 --> 01:20:34.162
What if this is
all you get, kid?

01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:36.331
What if this is it?

01:20:44.006 --> 01:20:46.508
It just...

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:50.094
it just seems like nothing is ever
enough with you, you know?

01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:55.350
And if you can't be satisfied
with what you got,

01:20:55.518 --> 01:20:57.644
then you're never
gonna be happy,

01:20:57.811 --> 01:20:59.812
no matter what you get.

01:21:06.529 --> 01:21:08.404
You asked me before

01:21:08.572 --> 01:21:11.574
if there was something
I wish was different.

01:21:13.953 --> 01:21:17.080
If there was one thing
I could change,

01:21:17.248 --> 01:21:20.041
that would be it.

01:21:20.209 --> 01:21:22.961
I just want to make you
proud of me.

01:21:25.756 --> 01:21:28.091
You want to make me proud?

01:21:29.843 --> 01:21:32.011
Make yourself proud.

01:21:32.179 --> 01:21:34.556
And I'm not talking
to "Mr. Football" here.

01:21:36.642 --> 01:21:39.018
I'm talking to Scott Murphy.

01:22:00.791 --> 01:22:02.709
Ahem...

01:22:29.612 --> 01:22:31.613
Sorry I'm late.

01:22:40.372 --> 01:22:41.539
Get dressed.

01:22:42.708 --> 01:22:44.876
(players cheering)

01:22:48.172 --> 01:22:49.756
Commentator:
Hello, everybody, and welcome

01:22:49.923 --> 01:22:51.883
to the Ohio State championship
football game.

01:22:52.051 --> 01:22:54.177
This is a true
David vs. Goliath story.

01:22:54.345 --> 01:22:56.220
There are 2,700 people

01:22:56.388 --> 01:22:58.681
in the blue collar community
of Coldwater, Ohio,

01:22:58.849 --> 01:23:01.142
all packed into this
small-town stadium

01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:03.061
to watch their home team
face off

01:23:03.228 --> 01:23:06.773
against the defending state champion
Cuyahoga Red Raiders...

01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:09.108
a team from a high school
with more students

01:23:09.276 --> 01:23:12.403
than this small town's
entire population.

01:23:13.405 --> 01:23:16.574
I know that all week long
you've been talking about losing,

01:23:16.742 --> 01:23:19.202
thinking about losing.

01:23:19.370 --> 01:23:21.954
Some of you are wondering if you should
even be playing in this game.

01:23:22.122 --> 01:23:24.207
Hell, there's probably
an accountant somewhere

01:23:24.375 --> 01:23:26.292
thinks a school our size
isn't worth it...

01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:27.752
I mean,
we don't have a chance.

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:30.630
Those guys over there think
we don't even belong on the same field,

01:23:30.798 --> 01:23:34.217
but somebody thinks they're worth
an air-conditioned tour bus.

01:23:35.594 --> 01:23:38.262
I want you
to go out there tonight

01:23:38.430 --> 01:23:41.182
and show everybody
it isn't the size of your bodies,

01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:44.268
the size of your buses
or your school that matters.

01:23:44.436 --> 01:23:47.730
It's the size of something else
that wins football games.

01:23:47.898 --> 01:23:50.650
- One, two, three...
- Team: Coldwater!

01:23:50.818 --> 01:23:52.860
(crowd cheering)

01:23:53.946 --> 01:23:55.863
Announcer:
Now taking the field,

01:23:56.031 --> 01:23:59.742
the Coldwater Black Bears!

01:24:03.122 --> 01:24:05.832
- Hall: Ready to make history?
- Change it at least.

01:24:22.516 --> 01:24:24.392
After the game,
you're mine.

01:24:25.436 --> 01:24:27.812
Jenny: Go Bears!
Whoo-hoo!

01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:29.814
(cheerleaders chanting)

01:24:29.982 --> 01:24:32.316
Let's do this.
Come on, let's go.

01:24:32.484 --> 01:24:35.361
- Coach: One, two, three...
- Cuyahoga: Red Raiders rule!

01:24:37.823 --> 01:24:39.866
Commentator:
Jablonsky, deep to return

01:24:40.033 --> 01:24:42.118
in the white jersey
and the red pants.

01:24:42.286 --> 01:24:44.495
And he'll take it right side
at his own goal line.

01:24:44.663 --> 01:24:46.414
He's up to the five
with a wall,

01:24:46.582 --> 01:24:48.291
to the 10, to the 15,
to the 20,

01:24:48.459 --> 01:24:50.001
to the 25, 30,

01:24:50.169 --> 01:24:52.211
35, 40.
Do you believe it?

01:24:52.379 --> 01:24:55.923
This isn't what Coach Hand
wanted to see.

01:24:56.091 --> 01:24:57.967
That is going all the way.

01:24:58.135 --> 01:25:01.137
Touchdown, Cuyahoga!
Wow!

01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:06.684
Right there.
Good job.

01:25:06.852 --> 01:25:10.354
Commentator: Coldwater's shocked
with that Jablonsky kickoff return.

01:25:10.522 --> 01:25:11.898
They're down seven-zip.

01:25:12.065 --> 01:25:14.358
- All right, let's get that right back.
- And the story here tonight

01:25:14.526 --> 01:25:17.403
is Scott Murphy.
He has carried this small-town team

01:25:17.571 --> 01:25:19.906
against all odds
into the state finals

01:25:20.073 --> 01:25:22.241
against the five-time
state champion

01:25:22.409 --> 01:25:24.076
Cuyahoga Raiders.

01:25:26.246 --> 01:25:29.040
(Murphy shouting commands)

01:25:29.208 --> 01:25:30.666
Black-18!

01:25:30.834 --> 01:25:32.001
Hike!

01:25:37.216 --> 01:25:39.217
Commentator:
Got a man open... and hit hard!

01:25:39.384 --> 01:25:41.219
- (whistle blows)
- And the pass is incomplete.

01:25:41.386 --> 01:25:43.304
Felt that one,
didn't you, Backwater?

01:25:43.472 --> 01:25:45.681
It's gonna keep coming.
It's gonna keep coming.

01:25:45.849 --> 01:25:48.935
Murphy got absolutely rocked
on that play.

01:25:49.102 --> 01:25:51.479
55 came across the field

01:25:51.647 --> 01:25:53.397
and lit him up
like a Zippo lighter.

01:25:53.565 --> 01:25:55.733
I'm gonna break your neck,
Backwater.

01:25:58.237 --> 01:25:59.403
Hike!

01:26:00.405 --> 01:26:02.657
(panting)

01:26:07.913 --> 01:26:10.665
Commentator: Scott Murphy has
almost zero protection in the pocket

01:26:10.833 --> 01:26:13.084
from the swarming
Cuyahoga defense.

01:26:15.712 --> 01:26:17.713
Slowing down,
huh, Backwater?

01:26:18.757 --> 01:26:20.007
Murphy:
I thrive on pain.

01:26:20.175 --> 01:26:21.968
Willard: I hope so.
It's coming all night.

01:26:22.135 --> 01:26:23.135
Good job.

01:26:23.303 --> 01:26:24.512
Hike.

01:26:27.766 --> 01:26:28.766
(whistle blows)

01:26:28.934 --> 01:26:30.768
Another late hit
by the Raiders' defense,

01:26:30.936 --> 01:26:33.062
this time on number 81
Chris Hall.

01:26:33.230 --> 01:26:35.106
What did I tell you?
That's exactly what I said.

01:26:35.274 --> 01:26:36.816
Commentator: The Red Raiders
seem to be bent

01:26:36.984 --> 01:26:38.901
on taking Scott Murphy
out of this ball game.

01:26:39.069 --> 01:26:40.444
Commentator #2:
They haven't taken him out,

01:26:40.612 --> 01:26:41.946
but they've certainly
contained him.

01:26:42.114 --> 01:26:43.990
Commentator #1:
And Willard is making the case

01:26:44.157 --> 01:26:47.368
that he should have been "Mr. Football"
here in the great state of Ohio.

01:26:47.536 --> 01:26:48.911
(yells)

01:26:49.913 --> 01:26:51.289
- (whistle blows)
- Get off him!

01:26:51.456 --> 01:26:53.332
Commentator:
Scott Murphy rocked again.

01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:55.293
It's got to be hard
for this hometown crowd

01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:58.212
to watch their star quarterback taking
this kind of beating here tonight.

01:26:58.380 --> 01:27:00.464
- I can't listen to this. Turn them off.
- And the only thing preventing...

01:27:00.632 --> 01:27:02.300
...the Raiders from running away...
- I can't listen to this.

01:27:02.467 --> 01:27:04.218
- Turn them off!
...with this ball game

01:27:04.386 --> 01:27:07.054
are the penalties, late hits,
and personal fouls.

01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:10.141
(grunts)

01:27:11.143 --> 01:27:13.978
Cheerleaders:
Let's go, Bears!

01:27:15.939 --> 01:27:17.315
Red Raiders on three!

01:27:17.482 --> 01:27:20.026
- One, two, three...
- Red Raiders rule!

01:27:23.363 --> 01:27:25.323
Caught by number 9 Kelly

01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:27.575
for another Cuyahoga
first down.

01:27:32.831 --> 01:27:35.207
And that is another
Cuyahoga touchdown

01:27:35.375 --> 01:27:39.503
as the Raiders pull
even further ahead of Coldwater.

01:27:40.505 --> 01:27:42.673
Right now Scott Murphy
has got to be wondering

01:27:42.841 --> 01:27:46.093
what he can do differently
to change the course of this ball game.

01:27:46.261 --> 01:27:48.346
Turn it up a notch.
Use your quickness.

01:27:48.513 --> 01:27:50.598
Now come on, Scott,
you're better than these guys.

01:27:50.766 --> 01:27:51.891
You're better
than all of them.

01:27:52.059 --> 01:27:53.851
Commentator:
Coach Hand on the sidelines

01:27:54.019 --> 01:27:55.686
trying to light a fire
under Scott Murphy.

01:27:55.854 --> 01:27:58.105
Willard:
It's gonna keep coming.

01:28:04.488 --> 01:28:05.488
Hike.

01:28:13.330 --> 01:28:15.164
(crowd cheering)

01:28:16.166 --> 01:28:17.541
Yeah! All right.

01:28:17.709 --> 01:28:20.002
Commentator: I don't know what
Coach Hand just said to Scott Murphy

01:28:20.170 --> 01:28:22.046
or what he was thinking about
on the sidelines,

01:28:22.214 --> 01:28:24.048
but he came back
in this ball game

01:28:24.216 --> 01:28:26.092
ready to prove something.

01:28:28.679 --> 01:28:30.554
(crowd cheering)

01:28:32.891 --> 01:28:35.017
Touchdown, Coldwater!

01:28:40.190 --> 01:28:42.233
Commentator:
Coldwater is still in this ball game!

01:28:42.401 --> 01:28:44.986
The score is 14-7.

01:28:45.153 --> 01:28:47.655
(workers cheering)

01:28:52.703 --> 01:28:54.954
(crowd cheering)

01:29:00.585 --> 01:29:02.753
Yeah, baby.
That's what I'm talking about.

01:29:02.921 --> 01:29:06.007
Hey, man, cheer up. The Raiders
are the best team in the state.

01:29:06.174 --> 01:29:07.967
It's happening again.
Control the whole game.

01:29:08.135 --> 01:29:09.760
We gotta get ahead.
We gotta get ahead.

01:29:09.928 --> 01:29:11.345
Get out there.
Get out there.

01:29:11.513 --> 01:29:12.680
Yeah, boy.

01:29:12.848 --> 01:29:15.182
And Coldwater trails 21-14

01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:17.852
as they head into the locker room
for halftime.

01:29:18.020 --> 01:29:20.271
(rimshots rapping)

01:29:46.757 --> 01:29:50.134
Gentlemen, some players
have talent.

01:29:50.302 --> 01:29:52.803
Others have heart.
But tonight

01:29:52.971 --> 01:29:55.931
I've seen players with talent
who I didn't know had any

01:29:56.099 --> 01:30:00.061
and others with heart
who I thought only had talent.

01:30:00.228 --> 01:30:02.813
The quality and standard
of your life

01:30:02.981 --> 01:30:06.817
will not be determined
by how well you play football,

01:30:06.985 --> 01:30:09.987
but by how well
you confront adversity...

01:30:10.155 --> 01:30:12.156
attitude.

01:30:12.324 --> 01:30:15.618
Gentlemen,
if you keep playing like this,

01:30:15.786 --> 01:30:17.286
I promise you

01:30:17.454 --> 01:30:20.623
you will leave this field winners.
Get in here.

01:30:20.791 --> 01:30:22.750
(players cheering)

01:30:22.918 --> 01:30:24.835
- One, two, three...
- Coldwater!

01:30:25.003 --> 01:30:26.629
Hand: That's what
I'm talking about.

01:30:26.797 --> 01:30:28.672
Scott...

01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:30.591
you know I've never seen you
play like this.

01:30:30.759 --> 01:30:32.259
I'm doing
the best I can, Coach.

01:30:32.427 --> 01:30:34.804
Yeah, but don't forget
you got 10 other players with you.

01:30:34.971 --> 01:30:37.181
You don't need to do this
all by yourself.

01:30:37.349 --> 01:30:39.850
You didn't carry this team here.
You led them.

01:30:40.018 --> 01:30:42.269
And they might not be
the biggest and the best players,

01:30:42.437 --> 01:30:44.063
but they're farm boys.

01:30:44.231 --> 01:30:46.774
Lean on them.
They won't break.

01:30:46.942 --> 01:30:47.983
Come on.

01:30:48.151 --> 01:30:50.402
(cheering)

01:31:02.541 --> 01:31:05.334
Yeah, okay.
Let's get it going, son.

01:31:05.502 --> 01:31:07.294
- Put Gig in.
- What?

01:31:07.462 --> 01:31:09.547
You want me to use my team.
Put Gig in.

01:31:12.676 --> 01:31:15.219
You want me to pull out a good receiver
and put in one who can't catch?

01:31:15.387 --> 01:31:17.054
No, just add a fourth
and spread them out.

01:31:17.222 --> 01:31:18.848
If I put in a fourth
wide out, son,

01:31:19.015 --> 01:31:20.975
that's gonna be one less body
protecting you.

01:31:21.143 --> 01:31:22.351
Yeah, I know.

01:31:22.519 --> 01:31:24.228
Let's go.

01:31:25.605 --> 01:31:27.898
(crowd cheering)

01:31:30.068 --> 01:31:31.735
Gig.

01:31:33.363 --> 01:31:34.405
Get in there.

01:31:34.573 --> 01:31:36.740
Get in where, Coach? In the game?
Somebody get hurt?

01:31:36.908 --> 01:31:39.034
Nobody.
Get in there.

01:31:42.372 --> 01:31:45.249
Commentator: Gig Bird,
number 2 in for Coldwater.

01:31:45.417 --> 01:31:47.376
Not sure what the plan is here
with Bird...

01:31:47.544 --> 01:31:51.297
zero career yards,
zero receptions.

01:31:51.464 --> 01:31:53.883
- Get open, cowboy.
- What are you talking about, Murph?

01:31:54.050 --> 01:31:55.509
- Changing history.
- What did he say?

01:31:55.677 --> 01:31:56.886
- On one, on one. Ready?
- Team: Break.

01:31:57.053 --> 01:31:59.054
(crowd cheering)

01:32:00.056 --> 01:32:03.017
Lineman: Hey, back up, back up, G.
What are you doing, man?

01:32:03.185 --> 01:32:04.351
Murphy:
Black EG!

01:32:04.519 --> 01:32:07.354
Commentator:
Murphy under center, huge play.

01:32:07.522 --> 01:32:09.106
Short drop.
Here comes the rush.

01:32:09.274 --> 01:32:11.025
He steps up and throws to Bird.
And the pass...

01:32:11.193 --> 01:32:14.236
is gonna be dropped. Wow.

01:32:14.404 --> 01:32:17.740
Gig has to catch that ball
up at the 27.

01:32:17.908 --> 01:32:19.533
- All right, all right.
- What the hell are you doing?

01:32:19.701 --> 01:32:21.076
- He was open.
- Yeah, he's always open,

01:32:21.244 --> 01:32:23.078
but we never throw it to him
because he can't catch.

01:32:23.246 --> 01:32:24.914
How do you know he can't catch
if we never throw it to him?

01:32:25.081 --> 01:32:26.707
He's right, man.
I ain't never caught one.

01:32:26.875 --> 01:32:28.292
Well, we're about
to change that.

01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:30.502
Red 33, Red 33.
On one, on one.

01:32:30.670 --> 01:32:32.213
- Ready?
- Break.

01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:35.466
Red 33! Red 33!

01:32:35.634 --> 01:32:37.092
Hike.

01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:43.432
Oh.

01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:46.977
Commentator: Murphy with a perfect
pass to Bird who was wide open.

01:32:48.897 --> 01:32:50.981
Just tell me you know
what you're doing here.

01:32:51.149 --> 01:32:52.608
Using my team, Coach.

01:32:52.776 --> 01:32:54.777
Hand: You got three other
receivers out there.

01:32:57.197 --> 01:32:59.782
Hall: All right, come on, man.
Amateur night's over.

01:32:59.950 --> 01:33:01.533
Just give me the ball
so we can get a first down.

01:33:01.701 --> 01:33:04.119
- Yeah, man, don't throw it to me.
- Don't worry, it's not coming near you.

01:33:04.287 --> 01:33:06.830
Good. 'Cause I play my best as a decoy.
See, I got them fooled.

01:33:06.998 --> 01:33:08.499
I got them right where I want them.
Keep the ball away from me.

01:33:08.667 --> 01:33:10.292
Red dog six.
On one, on one.

01:33:10.460 --> 01:33:11.710
- Ready?
- Break.

01:33:11.878 --> 01:33:13.963
Commentator: In the shotgun,
third and 10 from their own 20,

01:33:14.130 --> 01:33:16.465
four lineups.
Murphy needs a big game here.

01:33:18.051 --> 01:33:20.094
The ball is snapped.
Murphy back to throw.

01:33:22.389 --> 01:33:24.640
Short drop, looks over the middle.
The pass is gonna be...

01:33:24.808 --> 01:33:27.226
caught... by Bird

01:33:27.394 --> 01:33:29.478
for a first down
at the 35!

01:33:31.147 --> 01:33:32.481
(cheering)

01:33:33.566 --> 01:33:36.735
Commentator:
What a catch... by Bird!

01:33:36.903 --> 01:33:38.696
And the crowd loves it

01:33:38.863 --> 01:33:40.823
here in Coldwater, Ohio.

01:33:40.991 --> 01:33:43.826
Look at Gig.
They know how big

01:33:43.994 --> 01:33:45.995
- that throw and catch was...
- I caught one! I caught one!

01:33:46.162 --> 01:33:48.289
...for Coldwater.

01:33:51.584 --> 01:33:53.460
All right,
if Gig can catch one,

01:33:53.628 --> 01:33:55.504
we can win this game
and get home in one piece.

01:33:55.672 --> 01:33:58.173
Rodriguez, it's your turn.
We're gonna run the reverse with you.

01:33:58.341 --> 01:34:00.676
- I want to send you around the corner.
- What? What about Willard?

01:34:00.844 --> 01:34:02.803
Don't worry about Willard.
I'll take care of him.

01:34:02.971 --> 01:34:05.347
Boys, I want to get as far ahead
of them as possible

01:34:05.515 --> 01:34:07.641
- before the fourth quarter.
- Why didn't you say so?

01:34:07.809 --> 01:34:09.351
Hell, I thought we were just
trying to eat the clock.

01:34:09.519 --> 01:34:10.519
Murphy: All right, Rodriguez
reversed on one.

01:34:10.687 --> 01:34:12.354
Team:
Break!

01:34:14.190 --> 01:34:16.525
Willard:
Going down, Backwater.

01:34:16.693 --> 01:34:18.193
Murphy:
Blue 38.

01:34:18.361 --> 01:34:19.778
Hike.

01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:22.531
Commentator: Murphy to Rodriguez
on the reverse...

01:34:22.699 --> 01:34:25.034
the old "dipsy-do."
Rodriguez around the corner.

01:34:25.201 --> 01:34:26.702
Murphy lays out Willard.

01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:28.746
And Rodriguez scrambles
for another 10.

01:34:28.913 --> 01:34:30.372
Coldwater first down.

01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:31.707
All right.

01:34:31.875 --> 01:34:34.501
Hey, Willard, it's Coldwater...
with a C.

01:34:38.965 --> 01:34:41.550
Scott, 27 boot.

01:34:45.388 --> 01:34:48.807
All right, 27 boot
on one, on one.

01:34:48.975 --> 01:34:50.267
- Ready?
- Break.

01:34:54.230 --> 01:34:56.899
Willard:
Let's go, defense.

01:34:57.067 --> 01:34:59.276
Red seven.

01:34:59.444 --> 01:35:00.736
Hike.

01:35:06.409 --> 01:35:08.744
(crowd cheering)

01:35:11.081 --> 01:35:12.081
(cheering)

01:35:12.248 --> 01:35:13.832
Commentator:
Touchdown, Coldwater!

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.043
Yes! That's it.

01:35:22.258 --> 01:35:24.051
Attaboy. Attaboy.

01:35:24.219 --> 01:35:25.552
Jeez!

01:35:27.597 --> 01:35:29.223
We're in this thing.
We're in it.

01:35:33.353 --> 01:35:35.270
Commentator: And the Coldwater
defense coming together

01:35:35.438 --> 01:35:37.481
with a big stop
on third down,

01:35:37.649 --> 01:35:40.275
forcing the Red Raiders
to settle for a field goal.

01:35:43.029 --> 01:35:46.115
And it's blocked!
The field goal is blocked by Moss!

01:35:46.282 --> 01:35:47.699
It's blocked by Moss!

01:35:47.867 --> 01:35:50.077
Murphy starting things out
here in the second half.

01:35:50.245 --> 01:35:53.205
And now Coldwater
has a chance to pull ahead

01:35:53.373 --> 01:35:55.082
for the first time
in this ball game.

01:35:55.250 --> 01:35:57.459
(screams)
Get your head in the game!

01:35:57.627 --> 01:35:59.461
This is a state championship!

01:35:59.629 --> 01:36:02.256
Black razor. Black razor.

01:36:05.969 --> 01:36:08.512
Down. Set.

01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:12.015
Black 16. Black 16.

01:36:12.183 --> 01:36:13.559
Hike.

01:36:22.152 --> 01:36:23.193
(crowd cheering)

01:36:23.361 --> 01:36:24.945
Commentator:
That's gonna be caught!

01:36:25.113 --> 01:36:27.448
That's a touchdown, Coldwater!

01:36:29.159 --> 01:36:31.535
And this hometown crowd
is going crazy

01:36:31.703 --> 01:36:35.164
as Coldwater has taken the lead.
Can you believe it?

01:36:38.460 --> 01:36:40.836
Murphy:
We did it. We changed it!

01:36:41.004 --> 01:36:42.504
Whoo!

01:36:52.348 --> 01:36:53.932
(bell rings)

01:36:55.643 --> 01:36:58.020
- (buzzes)
- Thelma, what the hell are you doing?

01:36:58.188 --> 01:36:59.938
My job.
What the hell are you doing?

01:37:00.106 --> 01:37:01.940
- Your shift is up.
- No, it's not.

01:37:02.108 --> 01:37:05.319
- Are you gonna argue with me?
- Yeah. I need the hours.

01:37:05.487 --> 01:37:07.905
Okay, you got the hours,

01:37:08.072 --> 01:37:10.699
but your shift is done.
Now get out of here.

01:37:10.867 --> 01:37:13.494
- Get the hell out of here.
- All right, all right.

01:37:18.041 --> 01:37:20.417
(cheering)

01:37:25.381 --> 01:37:27.299
Commentator:
First and 10 for Coldwater.

01:37:27.467 --> 01:37:30.469
They can smell
a state championship trophy

01:37:30.637 --> 01:37:33.889
and a huge parade
in that small village of 2700.

01:37:34.057 --> 01:37:36.558
Cuyahoga is out of time outs.

01:37:36.726 --> 01:37:38.393
All Murphy needs to do

01:37:38.561 --> 01:37:41.063
is get a first down here
to run out the clock

01:37:41.231 --> 01:37:43.815
and they will be
the state champions.

01:37:45.068 --> 01:37:46.318
Come on, man,
what are we running?

01:37:46.486 --> 01:37:49.196
I-right, Z-motion,
48 boot.

01:37:49.364 --> 01:37:51.073
- On one, on one. Ready?
- Break.

01:37:52.367 --> 01:37:54.243
Murphy drops back.
Here comes the blitz.

01:37:54.410 --> 01:37:56.745
Murphy slips the tackle,
rolls left,

01:37:56.913 --> 01:37:59.373
scrambles out of the pocket,
looking down the field

01:37:59.541 --> 01:38:01.542
like he's gonna throw it.
Hall's double covered.

01:38:01.709 --> 01:38:03.293
Rodriguez looks open...

01:38:07.590 --> 01:38:09.424
And he's hit.
He fumbles the ball,

01:38:09.592 --> 01:38:11.760
picked up by Scotty Hamlin
at the 40,

01:38:11.928 --> 01:38:13.762
35, 30, 20,

01:38:13.930 --> 01:38:15.472
15, 10, 5.

01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:18.725
Do you believe it?
Touchdown, Cuyahoga!

01:38:19.769 --> 01:38:22.396
And it looks like Murphy
is down on the turf

01:38:22.564 --> 01:38:24.523
back at the 48.

01:38:24.691 --> 01:38:26.817
Murph, are you all right?

01:38:30.071 --> 01:38:32.406
Commentator: There is no way
this team comes back

01:38:32.574 --> 01:38:35.409
if Murphy can't get up
and back into the ball game.

01:38:37.078 --> 01:38:39.288
Hand: Let's see if we can get him up.
Easy now.

01:38:40.290 --> 01:38:42.416
(crowd cheering)

01:38:42.584 --> 01:38:44.126
Hand:
Get out of the way.

01:38:59.684 --> 01:39:01.476
Commentator:
And the big story for Coldwater

01:39:01.644 --> 01:39:03.312
has been quarterback
Scott Murphy.

01:39:03.479 --> 01:39:06.023
Raised by a single mother
who works in a factory,

01:39:06.190 --> 01:39:08.734
he was recently named
"Mr. Football"

01:39:08.901 --> 01:39:11.194
as the outstanding player
in the state.

01:39:11.362 --> 01:39:12.988
And the extra point is good.

01:39:13.156 --> 01:39:15.324
Cuyahoga now leads by four

01:39:15.491 --> 01:39:17.534
at the tail end
of this ball game.

01:39:17.702 --> 01:39:21.330
And Coldwater will need
a miracle touchdown to win it.

01:39:21.497 --> 01:39:23.457
Are you all right?
Are you good to go?

01:39:23.625 --> 01:39:25.167
- I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

01:39:25.335 --> 01:39:26.335
Yes.

01:39:26.502 --> 01:39:28.378
All right, run the clock.

01:39:28.546 --> 01:39:30.172
Work the sidelines.

01:39:31.841 --> 01:39:33.508
Commentator:
Cuyahoga heading out to kick.

01:39:33.676 --> 01:39:35.802
And it looks like Murphy
is getting into the game

01:39:35.970 --> 01:39:37.679
to receive for Coldwater.

01:39:46.189 --> 01:39:47.314
This is it, folks.

01:39:47.482 --> 01:39:50.108
A Coldwater victory here
would be a fairytale ending

01:39:50.276 --> 01:39:52.319
for this hardworking
blue collar community.

01:39:52.487 --> 01:39:54.404
13 seconds left in the game,

01:39:54.572 --> 01:39:56.239
just one time out remaining.

01:39:56.407 --> 01:39:58.742
Coldwater needs a touchdown
right here

01:39:58.910 --> 01:40:00.577
to win the state championship.

01:40:00.745 --> 01:40:04.456
Scott Murphy, "Mr. Football,"
deep to return the kick.

01:40:04.624 --> 01:40:06.708
And he'll take it
to the 50, to the 45.

01:40:06.876 --> 01:40:08.960
Murphy's hit, but he breaks the tackle,
he stays on his feet,

01:40:09.128 --> 01:40:10.545
- breaks another tackle...
- Come on, come on!

01:40:10.713 --> 01:40:12.464
...inside the 35, inside the 30,

01:40:12.632 --> 01:40:14.424
and is knocked down
at the 26.

01:40:14.592 --> 01:40:17.969
And he'll quickly call a time out
to talk to Coach Hand.

01:40:20.181 --> 01:40:22.391
This has been
one of the great games

01:40:22.558 --> 01:40:25.060
in Ohio high school
football history.

01:40:26.270 --> 01:40:29.731
3.5 seconds left on the clock
here in the fourth quarter.

01:40:29.899 --> 01:40:31.733
Third down, 42-38.

01:40:31.901 --> 01:40:34.152
Words exchanged
on the sidelines

01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:36.822
as Murphy
appears to be arguing

01:40:36.989 --> 01:40:38.573
the final play call
by Coach Hand.

01:40:38.741 --> 01:40:40.409
- I'm not running the bootleg.
- What?

01:40:40.576 --> 01:40:41.993
I'm not running Black Seven.
I'm not doing it.

01:40:42.161 --> 01:40:45.455
Son, we got 30 yards to cover
in one play. We're not running the ball.

01:40:45.623 --> 01:40:47.749
I know. I'm not running Black Seven.
I'm not doing it again.

01:40:47.917 --> 01:40:51.253
We're not running
Black Seven, okay?

01:40:51.421 --> 01:40:54.756
Let's go Red 24.

01:40:54.924 --> 01:40:57.676
Hit Hall or Rodriguez
in the corner.

01:40:57.844 --> 01:40:59.553
Wait, Coach, you want me
to throw the ball?

01:40:59.721 --> 01:41:01.930
Yeah, that's the play.
Let's get to the line of scrimmage.

01:41:02.098 --> 01:41:05.183
If you don't like something,
change it, audible.

01:41:05.351 --> 01:41:07.144
Coach, what?

01:41:07.311 --> 01:41:10.939
Scott, whatever happens,
it's your choice.

01:41:13.568 --> 01:41:15.068
Come on.

01:41:17.196 --> 01:41:18.780
- What are we running?
- I changed it.

01:41:18.948 --> 01:41:20.824
Changed what?

01:41:20.992 --> 01:41:22.868
Everything.

01:41:23.035 --> 01:41:25.287
(crowd cheering)

01:41:33.755 --> 01:41:35.964
All right, you guys ready
to win this?

01:41:36.132 --> 01:41:37.883
Red 24 on one.

01:41:38.050 --> 01:41:39.801
Hall, you're gonna be open
in the end zone.

01:41:39.969 --> 01:41:41.219
Catch it.
On one.

01:41:41.387 --> 01:41:42.387
- Ready?
- Break.

01:41:42.555 --> 01:41:43.638
Let's go.

01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:46.641
Hall: Me and you, buddy,
me and you.

01:41:48.853 --> 01:41:51.146
(crowd cheering)

01:41:54.233 --> 01:41:56.359
Down!

01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:49.287
Check! Check!

01:42:49.455 --> 01:42:50.872
Check. Check.

01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:53.583
- Black seven!
- What are you doing, man?

01:42:53.751 --> 01:42:55.418
- Black seven!
- Murphy, what are you doing?

01:42:55.586 --> 01:42:57.003
Black seven! Black seven!

01:42:57.171 --> 01:42:59.798
Black seven!
Black seven!

01:43:06.264 --> 01:43:08.306
Down!

01:43:09.725 --> 01:43:11.017
Set!

01:43:11.185 --> 01:43:12.644
Hike!

01:44:35.645 --> 01:44:37.646
Commentator:
Touchdown, Coldwater!

01:44:37.813 --> 01:44:40.982
They will be
the state champions of Ohio.

01:44:41.150 --> 01:44:42.692
Wow!

01:44:42.860 --> 01:44:45.111
(Murphy grunts)

01:44:48.699 --> 01:44:50.992
(winces)

01:44:59.961 --> 01:45:02.003
(birds chirping)

01:45:04.674 --> 01:45:06.967
(faint buzzing)

01:45:15.017 --> 01:45:16.017
(buzzing)

01:45:16.185 --> 01:45:17.769
Dispatch.

01:45:17.937 --> 01:45:20.021
Dispatch, this is Murphy.
Come in.

01:45:21.691 --> 01:45:23.358
Dispatch.

01:45:26.237 --> 01:45:28.071
(engine sputtering)

01:45:30.157 --> 01:45:32.409
(rattling)

01:45:34.829 --> 01:45:37.872
I ran out of gas.

01:46:03.899 --> 01:46:05.942
(clock chiming)

01:46:10.448 --> 01:46:12.741
(wind whistling)

01:46:18.289 --> 01:46:19.456
(bell dings)

01:46:24.712 --> 01:46:26.713
(static buzzes)

01:47:22.061 --> 01:47:25.438
(engine whirring)

01:47:27.441 --> 01:47:29.734
(voices chattering)

01:49:02.536 --> 01:49:04.495
Hand:
Come on, Culpepper.

01:49:04.663 --> 01:49:07.415
My grandmother could pick beans
faster than that.

01:49:19.511 --> 01:49:21.763
The best six-and-four team
I've ever seen.

01:49:22.932 --> 01:49:25.433
Seven and four.
We won tonight.

01:49:28.812 --> 01:49:30.146
Hey, Coach?

01:49:31.857 --> 01:49:33.733
Thanks.

01:49:33.901 --> 01:49:35.985
No need.

01:49:36.153 --> 01:49:37.946
Now I'll see you
on our field Monday.

01:49:38.948 --> 01:49:42.450
Tell your quarterbacks to be
dressed and ready at 3:00 sharp.

01:49:45.371 --> 01:49:47.622
(engine starts)

01:49:49.458 --> 01:49:51.709
Hand: Brandon, get those
baskets emptied

01:49:51.877 --> 01:49:53.878
and get your butt back here.

01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:56.881
Boy:
Hey, Mr. Murphy.

01:50:34.295 --> 01:50:35.461
(chuckles)

01:50:36.463 --> 01:50:38.673
Oh, look who decided
to show up.

01:50:38.841 --> 01:50:41.301
Gig: Murph, you missed
a hell of a ceremony, man.

01:50:41.468 --> 01:50:44.762
Yeah, this twig catches
one lucky pass... standing ovation.

01:50:44.930 --> 01:50:47.056
- Hey, you caught a pass?
- Gig: Man, that was nothing.

01:50:47.224 --> 01:50:48.474
They would have torn
the stadium down for you.

01:50:48.642 --> 01:50:49.767
- Dwight: Yep.
- Amen.

01:50:49.935 --> 01:50:53.021
No, this is better.
Where's my wife?

01:50:53.188 --> 01:50:55.648
In the barn.
She's been looking for you.

01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:07.785
Macy!

01:51:23.218 --> 01:51:25.595
- Krista: Daddy!
- Jamie: Daddy!

01:51:39.068 --> 01:51:40.401
Krista:
Here he is.

01:51:40.569 --> 01:51:43.071
(Macy laughs)
Here he is.

01:51:44.698 --> 01:51:46.783
Hi.

01:52:13.352 --> 01:52:15.478
You're back.

01:52:26.532 --> 01:52:28.324
Murphy:
I love you.

01:52:34.248 --> 01:52:35.790
Look at this.

01:52:35.958 --> 01:52:37.375
Look at all these people,
huh?

01:52:37.543 --> 01:52:39.293
I can't believe it.

01:52:41.004 --> 01:52:43.005
- Come here.
- Come on.

01:52:44.925 --> 01:52:46.592
Jamie:
Whoa.

01:52:47.845 --> 01:52:50.304
Murphy:
Look at all these people.

01:52:52.766 --> 01:52:54.350
This is fun.

01:52:54.518 --> 01:52:56.853
