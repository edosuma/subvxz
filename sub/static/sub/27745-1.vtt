You don't have to replant them
or anything, they just come back.

00:53.637 --> 00:55.969
- Every year?
- Every year. Forever.

00:57.641 --> 00:59.506
These were your
mother's favorite, peonies.

01:00.644 --> 01:02.054
She liked how fluffy they are.

Pretty fluffy for a flower.

- Twice.

03:10.107 --> 03:12.314
- How did he get it up there?
- Who cares?

03:12.776 --> 03:13.982
Just trying to get
the facts here, Maggie.

03:14.069 --> 03:15.605
Did you see him drive it up there?

03:15.737 --> 03:17.648
He took it up the logging road.

03:18.949 --> 03:19.938
How did he look?

03:20.784 --> 03:22.024
I guess he looked pretty good

03:22.119 --> 03:23.825
for an asshole
digging a hole on my property.

03:24.287 --> 03:25.652
- He looked just fine.
- Okay.

03:25.789 --> 03:27.120
I want you to arrest him.

03:27.624 --> 03:28.739
Come on, Maggie.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.449
Don't make excuses for him.

03:30.544 --> 03:33.331
I'm not making excuses.
He's definitely a knucklehead.

03:33.547 --> 03:34.787
Yeah, he's a knucklehead,

03:34.881 --> 03:37.964

04:08.665 --> 04:10.326

I don't want to know.

04:44.534 --> 04:45.944

04:53.001 --> 04:54.537
You, get off my land.

We got a bit
of a situation here, Ben.

Logan, I don't see
how this is any of your business.

04:59.883 --> 05:03.375
It's his business because you're
breaking the law, you asshole.

05:03.637 --> 05:07.050
You clearly don't
understand everything, as usual.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.342
This is my land, Logan.

- My land.

05:10.060 --> 05:11.641
You were never
meant to have the whole place.

05:11.728 --> 05:13.309
For one thing,
you aren't keeping it up.

05:13.480 --> 05:16.062
- Her husband died, the whole place...
- You leave him out of it.

05:16.149 --> 05:19.391
Oh, oh, oh. Yeah, he robbed me,
she robbed me, both of them robbed me.

05:19.486 --> 05:20.475
- Now, it's mine.
- Bullshit.

05:20.737 --> 05:23.149
You came to that office,
to that lawyer's office,

05:23.240 --> 05:25.026

- She is something.

- Okay.
- She is so crazy.

05:32.624 --> 05:35.491
- Okay, listen.
- It might interest you to know, Logan,

05:35.585 --> 05:38.167
that I acquired this land legally,
two weeks ago.

05:38.255 --> 05:40.997
"Acquired this land."
Who did you acquire it from?

05:41.091 --> 05:42.797
- Because I didn't sell it to you.
- Oh, didn't you?

05:42.884 --> 05:44.420
- No.
- Okay, you're claiming...

05:44.761 --> 05:45.750
No, not claiming.

05:46.096 --> 05:48.428
No, I have the permits.
I have everything in the truck.

I can't get in the middle of something

Before, when I asked, you said... No.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.576
You said that she was fine.

And yesterday,
she was clearly not fine.

17:51.487 --> 17:53.569
You're my lawyer.
You're supposed to take sides.

17:53.656 --> 17:54.862
You're supposed to take my side.

17:54.991 --> 17:58.074
I just... Mmm, I just wondered
if you knew why he would say that.

17:58.327 --> 18:01.364
'Cause he's a fucking lunatic,
that's why.

18:01.872 --> 18:02.861
Okay.

18:10.673 --> 18:12.709
Listen, I shot my brother.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.665
It was about time somebody did it.

18:14.844 --> 18:17.927
Everybody in this town has wanted
to shoot him at one point or another.

18:18.014 --> 18:19.629
There's no question about that.

18:19.974 --> 18:22.215
They should give me a fucking prize.

You okay?

Yeah, I'm fine.
I just need a ride, that's all.

19:51.607 --> 19:54.314
Yeah. I was over at Williams'
this morning,

19:55.277 --> 19:56.767
and I heard that you got arrested.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.610
It's totally ridiculous.

19:59.448 --> 20:00.938
Well, I heard that you shot Ben.

20:01.784 --> 20:03.194
He was invading my property,

20:03.285 --> 20:05.992
and, yes, I did shoot him,
and I should've shot him worse.

20:06.163 --> 20:09.405
And what you were doing hanging out
with him, I don't even want to know.

20:09.500 --> 20:13.209
All right, look. He told me that
he worked this out with you, okay.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.752
And Tom's been gone a year now,
so I thought maybe you had decided...

20:15.840 --> 20:18.377
No, I decided nothing,
and you thought wrong.

He's not here anymore.

21:09.685 --> 21:10.845
Well, where did he go?

21:12.271 --> 21:13.852
It says he signed himself out.

21:15.524 --> 21:16.604
But he's not dead?

21:16.692 --> 21:18.182
Yeah, it says he walked out
on his own steam.

out here in the trailer.

21:41.175 --> 21:42.460
It's my land.

It's Maggie's land, Ben.
Isn't that the problem?

21:47.431 --> 21:48.796
She's in big trouble.

21:49.433 --> 21:52.140
My point being is maybe you
should stay a few days with Gerry.

21:52.228 --> 21:54.184
- Huh?
- He's got central heating.

21:55.940 --> 21:56.975
I got heating.

21:57.399 --> 21:58.684
That propane tank's so old,

21:58.943 --> 22:00.558
it's gonna explode

to calm down,

into my place of work,

you know that you're screwed.

32:13.473 --> 32:15.338
I didn't tell him anything.

32:15.892 --> 32:17.598
Look, just so you know,

32:18.437 --> 32:19.847
you're not in trouble.

32:20.856 --> 32:23.598
She's the one
who's in trouble, all right?

32:23.692 --> 32:24.727
She shot me.

32:25.485 --> 32:28.227
(CHUCKLES) There's no
getting around that, right.

32:28.947 --> 32:29.936
I'm wounded.

32:31.283 --> 32:33.023
She's in big fucking trouble.

32:33.869 --> 32:36.781
And the boom
is coming down on my sister.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.196
Okay. Yes.

32:39.624 --> 32:41.285
But there are other people

32:41.376 --> 32:43.207
looking into this situation
right now.

32:43.753 --> 32:45.163
But this is what I'm saying.

32:45.464 --> 32:48.251
You don't have
to worry about it, right.

32:48.383 --> 32:52.592
You don't have to talk
about it with anybody, all right.

32:52.721 --> 32:54.461
- Well...
- This is all on her.

32:54.681 --> 32:55.796
It's... (LAUGHING)

32:55.891 --> 32:58.473
She has been caught in a web
of her own making.

32:58.560 --> 32:59.891
It took years.

33:00.562 --> 33:04.555
It took time, a lot of years
of planning and execution.

33:04.900 --> 33:10.566
It's only her malfeasance
and ingratitude and disloyalty

33:11.406 --> 33:13.897
that have brought her to this point.

33:14.326 --> 33:17.864
And it is nothing that we did.

33:18.622 --> 33:22.410
It's just the poisonous defects
of her own disappointing character.

for your help?

We'll be in touch.

34:46.333 --> 34:47.665
What were you telling them?

34:48.795 --> 34:49.784
What?

34:50.088 --> 34:51.998
Did you not understand my question?

34:54.217 --> 34:55.206
I don't...

34:55.885 --> 34:57.341
I don't even know who you are.

34:57.846 --> 34:59.552
No, you don't know who I am at all.

steal my house.

Mrs. Kramer,

35:05.353 --> 35:08.220
you are very behind on your taxes.

35:08.315 --> 35:09.521
What's that to you?

35:09.816 --> 35:10.805
It is a fact.

35:11.109 --> 35:14.397
And if you lose your land,
it is not my doing.

35:15.614 --> 35:17.605
You're letting them turn you
into the kind of person

35:17.699 --> 35:21.362
who can destroy another person's life
without even thinking twice about it.

35:23.121 --> 35:24.110
I don't...

35:25.165 --> 35:27.497
- My boyfriend says...
- Your boyfriend?

35:30.712 --> 35:32.327
Dream bigger, would you?

35:33.214 --> 35:34.829
If you can't dream bigger now,

35:34.924 --> 35:37.006
you think it's ever
gonna get any better?

35:39.179 --> 35:40.385
You're crazy.

35:41.765 --> 35:42.754
Yeah.

35:43.558 --> 35:46.049
Makes you feel better
when you tell yourself that.

35:46.978 --> 35:48.093
But guess what.

That's my land.
My father left me that land.

And then you sold it
to your Sister and her husband.

What kind of loan, honey?

45:03.868 --> 45:04.857
Well, it's for...

45:05.953 --> 45:08.035
It's for my mom, actually.

45:08.456 --> 45:09.445
Is she okay?

45:09.582 --> 45:11.664
Yeah, she's just struggling
a little bit,

45:11.751 --> 45:14.914
and I'd love to help her out
any way that I could.

45:15.046 --> 45:17.628
You know, pay her back for college.

45:18.132 --> 45:20.498

$10,000 or something.

45:22.136 --> 45:25.128
Well, I can get the paperwork
going on that, sure,

45:25.223 --> 45:29.136
but, honey, I can't imagine
what you have to use as collateral.

45:29.810 --> 45:30.799
Oh.

45:33.731 --> 45:36.143

some logging now.

Yeah. You have a problem with that?

45:51.040 --> 45:53.998
No, no, I think it's a good idea.

45:54.710 --> 45:58.373
Good. And we're cool, right?

45:58.798 --> 46:01.710
We're always cool, Ben. You just
got to pay for what you're buying.

46:01.801 --> 46:04.338
Sending that kid to steal
the papenNork, that's not right.

46:05.221 --> 46:08.429
He didn't send me. I didn't steal it.
I borrowed it.

46:08.766 --> 46:14.181
So, you used the logging rights
to borrow the money

46:14.855 --> 46:16.015
to buy them.

46:16.732 --> 46:19.018
No, actually, no,
they didn't go for that,

46:19.110 --> 46:21.066
so we used my car as collateral.

46:21.445 --> 46:23.356
Mrs. Farr knows my mom from way back

46:23.489 --> 46:26.071
and that seemed
to make the most sense.

47:11.746 --> 47:13.486
Yeah, the fluffy ones.
I forgot what they were called.

47:13.581 --> 47:15.117
- Look at the horse.
- Wow.

47:15.374 --> 47:17.490
Look, there's Snow White, I think.

47:17.585 --> 47:18.825
Maybe that could be Rose Red.

YOUNG MAGGIE: Mmm.

47:20.254 --> 47:21.243
Yeah.

47:21.339 --> 47:22.499
Look at, like, the woods behind...

47:22.590 --> 47:24.080
Oh, yeah, that... Uh-huh.

a tiny bit creepy.

47:53.829 --> 47:55.945
I thought I told you
to get off my land.

47:57.750 --> 47:58.865
You know what, Maggie?

47:58.959 --> 48:03.123
You're not allowed to tell me
where I'm allowed to be.

48:03.506 --> 48:05.087
On my property, I am.

48:10.304 --> 48:12.215
I see you lost your backhoe.

48:14.016 --> 48:15.756
I see you lost your mind.

48:16.143 --> 48:18.930
And you're probably just gonna
leave it like this, aren't you?

48:19.438 --> 48:21.724
Just a big hole in the earth.

48:22.650 --> 48:23.935
Come back here,

48:24.485 --> 48:28.398
you dig a big, ugly, black hole,
then you take off again.

48:28.948 --> 48:30.154
That's what you do.

48:30.491 --> 48:31.480
You wish.

48:32.284 --> 48:34.525
I wish you'd leave me alone
is what I wish.

I'm not gonna just
dig a hole here.

48:40.709 --> 48:43.576
I'm gonna build a house here.
I'm gonna live here.

Not on my land you're not.

48:45.506 --> 48:49.169

What do you care? Hmm?

48:50.970 --> 48:54.554
You don't use it anyway.
Tom is dead and you're alone.

48:55.474 --> 48:57.339
You leave Tom out of this.

48:57.601 --> 49:00.263
You're alone, and he's not around
to protect you

49:00.354 --> 49:02.140

49:05.109 --> 49:06.599
That's hilarious.

49:11.657 --> 49:12.737
You left.

49:13.993 --> 49:15.858
Oh, for the love of God.

49:17.204 --> 49:19.365
People leave and then they come back.

49:20.040 --> 49:22.201
Yeah, they come back
after their father's dead.

49:23.711 --> 49:25.451
He died calling your name.

"Where's Maggie? Where's Maggie?"

49:27.882 --> 49:29.793
- Don't say that to me.
- "Where's my Maggie?"

49:29.884 --> 49:32.250
- Don't say that to me.
- Why not? It's true.

49:32.720 --> 49:35.678

and that's on you,

49:36.056 --> 49:37.546

And you don't get to tell me
that I didn't do the dishes enough.

49:53.908 --> 49:54.988
You know what?

49:56.535 --> 49:58.742
When you're this close,
I can smell you.

50:00.247 --> 50:02.283
When was the last time
you took a bath?

50:04.084 --> 50:07.542
You smell like some
kind of dead animal in the woods.

50:09.965 --> 50:11.796
You don't like it, you can leave.

50:13.219 --> 50:15.084

50:50.339 --> 50:51.328
We won't forget.

Gerry, do you have something
you want to put in?

50:53.968 --> 50:54.957
Here.

- What's this?
- It's a heart.

He's been dead almost a year.

52:21.388 --> 52:23.504
Oh, I know. I just thought,

52:24.308 --> 52:28.142
well, maybe you didn't want
anybody sitting in his chair.

52:29.229 --> 52:33.097
Well, we used to sit out here
every night, you know,

52:33.192 --> 52:34.602

52:39.073 --> 52:40.062

the whole thing to the ground.

- You seen him lately?

to do some logging,

- Yes.

they're gonna kick me to the...

And who knows even what they're
gonna do with me.

in some nursing home with no windows,

and terrible nurses
who tie you to the bed.

- Yes.

"and helped her with her housework,

"or read to her

I'm sorry I shot you.

01:03:00.026 --> 01:03:01.857
I'm sorry I shot you, Benny.

01:03:17.919 --> 01:03:19.375
I'm sorry.

(EXHALES)

01:03:35.687 --> 01:03:36.676
Oh.

01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:38.219
Hello.

01:03:38.648 --> 01:03:39.637
You the lawyer?

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.015
- Samuelson?
- Uh...

01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:44.900
I'm sor... I'm sorry, do I know you?

01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:47.111
I'm Ben Farmer's son.

01:03:47.615 --> 01:03:50.823
Oh, yes. Yes, I heard. That's...

01:03:51.911 --> 01:03:53.242
Come, come, come.

01:03:57.125 --> 01:03:58.114
How is Ben?

01:03:59.210 --> 01:04:00.199
He's bad.

01:04:01.004 --> 01:04:01.993
Oh.

01:04:02.213 --> 01:04:04.579
I heard he was doing better.
He's not still in the hospital?

01:04:05.467 --> 01:04:07.253
Very much still in the hospital.

01:04:08.303 --> 01:04:09.543
I think he's gonna die.

01:04:11.598 --> 01:04:13.964
I'm sorry to hear it.

01:04:14.768 --> 01:04:16.599
That doesn't do anybody any good.

01:04:18.438 --> 01:04:19.427
Well...

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:21.521
My assistant's not in yet.

01:04:21.608 --> 01:04:24.190
I'd offer you coffee,
or condolences...

01:04:24.277 --> 01:04:26.518
Look, I got to say this, 'cause I
have to be on top of this now.

01:04:26.613 --> 01:04:28.820
If Ben dies,
it's because his sister shot him.

01:04:31.368 --> 01:04:32.699
So, what's the question?

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:36.194
I'm his only living heir, right?

01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:38.826
I mean, she can't shoot him
and then inherit all that land.

01:04:38.917 --> 01:04:42.455
- That doesn't make any sense.
- Okay. Come. Uh, sit down.

01:04:47.008 --> 01:04:49.875
First things first.
Does Ben have a will?

01:04:51.221 --> 01:04:52.210
Does that matter?

01:04:52.597 --> 01:04:53.632
If he has a will, of course,

01:04:53.723 --> 01:04:55.839
his worldly possessions
will be distributed accordingly.

01:04:55.934 --> 01:04:58.550
If he doesn't have one,
everything goes to the next of kin.

01:04:58.645 --> 01:05:02.263
Okay. Right.
Is that me or his sister?

01:05:02.357 --> 01:05:04.222
Well, you were right a moment ago.

01:05:04.317 --> 01:05:07.184
If he dies from a gunshot wound
which she inflicted,

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.402
the law nullifies her claim.

01:05:09.823 --> 01:05:11.814
Does he have any other offspring?

01:05:14.828 --> 01:05:15.817
No.

01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:17.819
No.

01:05:20.834 --> 01:05:22.165
So, what if he doesn't die?

01:05:24.087 --> 01:05:25.076
Oh.

01:05:25.171 --> 01:05:26.160
Well,

01:05:27.048 --> 01:05:29.630
then no one inherits anything.

01:05:38.435 --> 01:05:40.596
- Damn it, Ben! Where did you put it?
- (CLATTERING)

and not a goddamn worthwhile
fucking thing in his fucking life.

01:05:45.525 --> 01:05:46.514

01:05:51.823 --> 01:05:52.812

01:05:53.032 --> 01:05:54.021
Hi.

01:05:55.201 --> 01:05:56.987
- How you doing?
- Well...

01:05:59.122 --> 01:06:00.578
How do you think I'm doing?

01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:03.031
Oh, I just, um...

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:07.626
I just came
to get your father's blanket.

01:06:08.256 --> 01:06:09.371
- There.
- Okay.

01:06:10.049 --> 01:06:11.038
What is that?

01:06:12.510 --> 01:06:14.091
It's a blanket.
I thought he might want it.

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:16.302
No, what kind of animal is that?

01:06:16.389 --> 01:06:17.378
Um...

01:06:19.058 --> 01:06:22.676
I don't think it's an animal.
I think he got it from Walmart.

01:06:23.897 --> 01:06:24.886
All right.

01:06:34.073 --> 01:06:35.859
You know, Ben worked so hard
to get those documents

01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:39.363
to prove that he is entitled to this
property that she stole from him.

01:06:40.079 --> 01:06:41.865
Well, it's a little more
complicated than that.

01:06:41.956 --> 01:06:44.618
Well, it don't matter if it's more
complicated than that.

01:06:45.627 --> 01:06:46.616
Right?

01:06:46.753 --> 01:06:50.211
Those logging rights say
that he's entitled to this land,

01:06:50.423 --> 01:06:52.414
and if he dies, then we got to have
that piece of paper.

01:06:57.472 --> 01:06:58.461
I got it.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.340
Say what now? You said you got it?

01:07:06.105 --> 01:07:07.515
Well, I just, um...

01:07:08.650 --> 01:07:11.483
I just thought that someone
should take care of it.

01:07:14.239 --> 01:07:15.228
This...

01:07:23.623 --> 01:07:24.783
All right.

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:27.949
Thank you.

01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:33.921
Hey, Gerry.

01:07:36.386 --> 01:07:38.126
You don't happen to know
if Ben had a will, do you?

01:07:39.347 --> 01:07:40.803
You mean, if he has a will?

01:07:41.933 --> 01:07:42.922
Yeah, that's what I mean.

01:07:43.601 --> 01:07:46.343
Well, Ben doesn't think much
of documents.

01:07:47.397 --> 01:07:48.807
They don't make sense to him, so...

01:07:50.108 --> 01:07:51.393
I'd be surprised.

01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:55.059

No, no, no, he's gonna be fine.

use my extra room,

01:31:33.238 --> 01:31:35.775
It's just as easy
to fall in love with a good man

01:31:35.865 --> 01:31:37.901
as it is to fall in love with a jerk.

01:31:38.326 --> 01:31:39.315
Huh?

01:31:40.870 --> 01:31:42.656
Let's take this out to the Sheriff.

01:31:47.127 --> 01:31:48.116
Yeah.

01:32:02.434 --> 01:32:03.674
(GIGGLING)

01:32:07.063 --> 01:32:08.678
SAMUELSON: Here you go.
Away from your face.

01:32:08.773 --> 01:32:10.058
See, Daddy sometimes knows
what he's talking about.

01:32:10.150 --> 01:32:12.641
- All right, now go, have fun.
- (CHILD LAUGHING)

01:32:12.861 --> 01:32:13.850
Come on over here.

01:32:14.029 --> 01:32:15.610
Grab this one. Grab this.

01:32:17.657 --> 01:32:19.613
Not near your face though.
Nowhere near your face.

01:32:19.701 --> 01:32:21.487
But roam around, roam around.

01:32:23.246 --> 01:32:24.782
RAY: All right, you need another one?

01:32:25.623 --> 01:32:26.829
SAMUELSON: There you go.

01:32:26.916 --> 01:32:28.952
GIRL: No. That thing is too small.

01:32:29.461 --> 01:32:30.450
Wait.

01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:34.996
- I need one. I do.
- You need one?

01:32:35.383 --> 01:32:37.374
You want one,
but you didn't bring me a beer.

01:32:37.469 --> 01:32:39.801
(ALL CONTINUE CHATTING INDISTINCTLY)

01:32:48.563 --> 01:32:49.973
RAY: We've got some more.

01:32:50.065 --> 01:32:51.771
- (RAY CHUCKLING)
- (BOY SHOUTING)

01:32:51.858 --> 01:32:53.348
SAMUELSON: Yeah, yeah.

01:32:54.986 --> 01:32:56.317
You're shooting out fire.

01:32:56.821 --> 01:32:57.981
GIRL: I've run out.

01:32:58.114 --> 01:32:59.399
SAMUELSON: Oh, no, get around.

01:33:05.872 --> 01:33:07.282
- GIRL: It's burning up.
- Yeah.

01:33:10.668 --> 01:33:11.874
Oh, my gosh.

01:33:12.504 --> 01:33:15.120
Oh, what are you doing?
Lighting us up?

01:33:16.549 --> 01:33:18.005
CURT: Ooh!

01:33:18.676 --> 01:33:21.008
CURT: Did you ever punk
your brother or sister?

01:33:21.846 --> 01:33:22.926
BOY: I want to.

01:33:23.014 --> 01:33:24.345
(CURT LAUGHING)

01:33:25.266 --> 01:33:26.506
RAY: Run around.

01:33:28.186 --> 01:33:30.848
BEN: And this part
would've been all built

01:33:30.939 --> 01:33:34.602
if this one hadn't
taken his backhoe back,

01:33:34.692 --> 01:33:37.229
or wherever that puny little
thing went. (CHUCKLES)

01:33:38.696 --> 01:33:39.936
Here it is.

01:33:40.031 --> 01:33:42.864
The cathedral in all its...

01:33:43.827 --> 01:33:44.942
BEN: Oh...

01:33:45.036 --> 01:33:46.367
Good idea.

01:33:46.663 --> 01:33:47.652
What's this?

01:33:47.789 --> 01:33:49.029
It's a time capsule.

01:33:49.249 --> 01:33:50.910
We buried it when we were kids.

01:33:51.167 --> 01:33:52.156
Yeah.

01:33:52.627 --> 01:33:54.333
Ben found it down by the pond.

01:33:55.046 --> 01:33:57.788
- Tony Pérez rookie card. Huh.
- BEN: Yeah.

01:33:57.882 --> 01:34:00.498
All this stuff is priceless,

01:34:00.969 --> 01:34:04.211
and particularly this.

01:34:05.265 --> 01:34:06.971
- Is that real?
- (GERRY CHUCKLES)

01:34:07.058 --> 01:34:09.549
Why would we bury it
if it wasn't real?

01:34:10.186 --> 01:34:11.471
Why would you bury anything?

01:34:12.021 --> 01:34:13.352
We were kids.

01:34:13.565 --> 01:34:14.930
- Yeah.
- Oh.

01:34:17.235 --> 01:34:18.520
This is, uh...

01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:20.309
My dad.

01:34:20.405 --> 01:34:22.396
That's your granddad right there.

01:34:25.743 --> 01:34:27.358
That's your granddad.

01:34:30.582 --> 01:34:32.243
CURT: Who put the matches in there?

01:34:33.501 --> 01:34:35.492
BEN: Okay, you're a lawyer,

01:34:35.587 --> 01:34:38.875
so I'm loath to confess,
but I have to. It was me.

01:34:39.507 --> 01:34:41.623
RAY: (CHUCKLING)
Why am I not surprised?

01:34:41.718 --> 01:34:42.924
- (BEN CHUCKLES)
- (RAY LAUGHS)

01:34:43.052 --> 01:34:47.796
BEN: I knew I was gonna be needing
to spark things up a little bit.

01:34:48.016 --> 01:34:49.552
You know who that is?

01:34:49.642 --> 01:34:51.382
Yeah, it's Parker.

01:34:52.395 --> 01:34:53.635
Notorious Comanche chief.

01:34:53.730 --> 01:34:54.719
- Check this out right there.
- He was reading it.

01:34:54.814 --> 01:34:56.896
- You don't know who that is?
- BEN: Whoa, whoa. Yoo-hoo.

01:34:57.108 --> 01:34:58.939
BEN: Oh, my God.

01:34:59.277 --> 01:35:01.108
- CURT: What the...
- Oh, my God!

01:35:01.279 --> 01:35:03.270
- Oh, damn!
- There's the lips, there's...

01:35:03.948 --> 01:35:07.486
BEN: Two handed booty grab.
RAY: Gerry!

01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:10.743
- Oh, my God. Love unleashed.
- CURT: They ain't quitting either.

01:35:10.830 --> 01:35:12.366
CU RT: Wow.
BEN: There it is.

01:35:12.457 --> 01:35:13.663
CURT: Wow, that's the blueprint
for how to do it.

01:35:13.750 --> 01:35:14.739
- BEN: Yeah.
- (RAY CHUCKLING)

01:35:14.834 --> 01:35:16.290
At their age?

01:35:16.461 --> 01:35:17.667
- Oh.
