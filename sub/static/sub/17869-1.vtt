What? What? It's here! Here!

03:09.106 --> 03:13.085
Overboard! Throw overboard!

03:21.159 --> 03:22.493
Hurry up!

03:24.413 --> 03:26.390
It is stuck!

04:20.469 --> 04:22.845
<i>Onward Christian soldiers</i>

04:22.846 --> 04:24.597
Get back! Get back!

04:24.598 --> 04:27.933
<i>- Marching as to war</i>
- They're all crazy!

04:27.934 --> 04:29.268
Get off!

04:29.269 --> 04:32.938
Swales, for God's sake,
give these poor wretches

04:32.939 --> 04:35.608
some laudanum to calm
their shattered nerves!

04:35.609 --> 04:39.737
- They won't take nothing, Dr. Seward!
- Well, give them something, anything!

04:39.738 --> 04:41.489
I can't. Get away, come on.

04:41.490 --> 04:45.409
Dr. Seward! Dr. Seward,
where's Miss Lucy?

04:45.410 --> 04:48.329
Where's Miss Lucy to
help with my baby?

04:48.330 --> 04:50.706
Mrs. Galloway, where
is my daughter?

04:50.707 --> 04:52.541
Miss Lucy's upstairs
in the house, sir,

04:52.542 --> 04:54.585
looking after that friend of hers.

04:54.586 --> 04:58.506
Fine time to abandon us.
Swales, I'm coming down.

04:58.507 --> 05:02.202
- Swales, I'm coming down. Out of the way!
- All quiet, sir!

05:02.427 --> 05:04.136
"But anyway, you needn't worry.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.638
"As soon as you finish law school,

05:05.639 --> 05:08.140
"I'm sure our firm will
hire you in a second."

05:08.141 --> 05:09.308
Hey.

05:09.309 --> 05:14.004
"You will make a beautiful addition to the
firm of Snodgrass, Shilling and Wallop."

05:14.147 --> 05:16.374
Oh! Oh, Lord! Quick!

05:17.108 --> 05:19.276
Oh! Is it all right?

05:19.277 --> 05:21.254
Yes, yes.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.322
You know, Lucy,
you're so much braver

05:23.323 --> 05:25.533
than I am, taking on all
those men like that.

05:25.534 --> 05:28.452
But don't you think we ought to have
some influence, some say on things?

05:28.453 --> 05:30.955
- After all, we are not chattels.
- We are not chattels.

05:30.956 --> 05:32.498
- No, I know we're not.
- Miss Lucy.

05:32.499 --> 05:33.624
Yes?

05:33.625 --> 05:35.626
Your father says he needs
you in the wards right away.

05:35.627 --> 05:37.378
- Yes, I'm coming.
- Do you have to go now, Lucy?

05:37.379 --> 05:40.198
- Yes, into bed with you.
- All right.

05:41.508 --> 05:44.031
- Here we go.
- Thank you.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.805
Now, remember, Mina,

05:47.806 --> 05:51.016
if you don't rest, you'll be stuck
in this bedroom all winter.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.184
Yes, you're quite right.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.636
- You go down to them. I'll be fine.
- Good night, darling.

05:54.637 --> 05:56.209
Good night.

06:10.453 --> 06:12.121
Lucy, we've got our work cut out.

06:12.122 --> 06:14.957
I'm sorry, Papa, but Mina isn't
feeling at all well tonight.

06:14.958 --> 06:18.711
I know she's our friend, but, really,
Mina's never feeling very well.

06:18.712 --> 06:19.962
Now, Papa, that's not fair.

06:19.963 --> 06:22.715
We invited her here for her health,
and we have to look after her.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.884
Oh, Annie, don't
worry, I'll take him.

06:24.885 --> 06:28.512
Let me take him, darling.
There we are.

06:28.513 --> 06:31.390
Oh, it can't be as bad as that.

06:33.018 --> 06:34.310
Bells!

06:34.311 --> 06:35.603
What, bells?

06:35.604 --> 06:37.688
Hollow bells! Listen!

06:37.689 --> 06:39.398
Sunken bells.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.984
Sunken bells. Are you mad, Swales?

06:41.985 --> 06:46.260
It's just the church bells to
warn the ships, that's all.

10:05.522 --> 10:08.774
That's it. A little
bit more. Right.

10:08.775 --> 10:12.879
Come on, you two, get your
hands out of your pockets.

10:12.904 --> 10:14.613
No, no, no!

10:14.614 --> 10:17.637
Say, keep them bits
of timber separate.

10:18.201 --> 10:21.703
Tell them women to get out of
the way if they're not helping.

10:21.704 --> 10:24.456
It's freezing, isn't it? Freezing.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.416
Come on, now, son,
grab hold of this.

10:26.417 --> 10:28.377
It'll give our mum some
tidy frocks, won't it, Dad?

10:28.378 --> 10:31.713
Hey, watch that boom! It'll
knock your bloody head off.

10:31.714 --> 10:34.658
Not likely. The thing
about these wrecks...

10:46.771 --> 10:48.063
Hey, what is it?

10:48.064 --> 10:50.166
He's in that contraption.

10:53.403 --> 10:55.237
Perhaps it will have your
fingers up. But all right.

10:55.238 --> 10:56.321
Aye, aye.

10:56.322 --> 10:58.031
Should we not hitch the...

10:58.032 --> 11:00.851
Leave all that there.

11:01.744 --> 11:03.561
Morning, sir.

11:03.746 --> 11:06.644
- Fancy.
- That he is! He's fancy.

11:09.294 --> 11:11.962
- Sorry, no one allowed on board.
- I've got business on board.

11:11.963 --> 11:14.590
- What sort of business?
- I'm a solicitor, Jonathan Harker,

11:14.591 --> 11:16.133
and I've been on the road
all night from London.

11:16.134 --> 11:19.219
Jonathan! It's all
right, let him pass.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.197
Right. Carry on.

11:22.307 --> 11:24.308
What the devil are you doing here?

11:24.309 --> 11:26.268
Our firm was telegraphed yesterday

11:26.269 --> 11:29.088
that this ship had been
sighted a week early.

11:29.230 --> 11:31.298
Oh, God.

11:32.442 --> 11:33.942
The man we represented
in the purchase

11:33.943 --> 11:35.527
of Carfax Abbey, Count Dracula...

11:35.528 --> 11:37.112
Count Dracula, of course!

11:37.113 --> 11:40.282
- How stupid of me, I almost forgot in all...
- Is he safe?

11:40.283 --> 11:41.658
- Who?
- Dracula.

11:41.659 --> 11:43.785
Oh, yes. He's the only one who is.

11:43.786 --> 11:48.391
Young Mina found him on the beach
last night, and we took him to Carfax.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.834
As for the rest of the crew...

11:50.835 --> 11:52.127
Look.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.214
What happened?

11:55.215 --> 11:58.050
We don't know. Maybe
the ship's log will tell us.

11:58.051 --> 12:01.029
All right, swing
them across, Harry.

12:01.471 --> 12:03.889
Excuse me. Is all this
cargo the Count's?

12:03.890 --> 12:05.140
Well, there's more down below,

12:05.141 --> 12:07.643
but the rest of the crates
broke up on them rocks.

12:07.644 --> 12:08.977
Filled up with some kind of dirt.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.312
Dirt? What for?

12:10.313 --> 12:12.689
Whatever it is, I'll take it.
I'll put it on me wagon.

12:12.690 --> 12:14.191
You can't do that, Renfield.

12:14.192 --> 12:15.817
The Count's not here
to sign for them

12:15.818 --> 12:17.903
and they stay here until
he comes around himself.

12:17.904 --> 12:20.155
I'm sorry, Harbormaster, but
the rights of the ship owner

12:20.156 --> 12:21.740
are already completely sacrificed,

12:21.741 --> 12:24.594
since the tiller of this
vessel is held in a dead hand.

12:24.827 --> 12:27.913
Now, where's the rest of Dracula's
baggage? I'd like to inspect that as well.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.539
- Come this way.
- Harker,

12:29.540 --> 12:32.839
you sold me house right out
from under me and you sold

12:32.840 --> 12:36.589
that poor old Count a right bill of
goods with your fancy silver tongue.

12:36.590 --> 12:37.673
Renfield!

12:37.674 --> 12:39.925
I've half a mind to tell
Dracula he been took good.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.551
Mr. Renfield!

12:41.552 --> 12:44.680
I wonder if I could impose upon you
to ask the Count when he rises

12:44.681 --> 12:47.599
if he would join us for dinner
tonight at Billerbeck Hall.

12:47.600 --> 12:48.892
What, at the loony bin?

12:48.893 --> 12:52.271
At my home, Mr. Renfield. Come.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.605
Well, I'll give him the message,

12:53.606 --> 12:57.335
but I don't think he'll be in the
mood for any fancy socializing.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.472
A little bit more.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.731
Morning, ma'am.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.902
Jonathan!

13:24.637 --> 13:27.911
Thank God, you're here!
We've had the most...

13:28.641 --> 13:30.100
There, there, that's
enough of that.

13:30.101 --> 13:31.643
Save that till after
you're married.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.061
I can't tell you how
dreadful it's been.

13:33.062 --> 13:34.730
- Mina went...
- Slow down, Lucy, Lucy, Lucy.

13:34.731 --> 13:37.232
Lucy, slow down. I had to come up
here to meet your new neighbor.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.484
It was terrifying. Mina found
him washed up on the beach.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.486
It's a miracle he's not dead.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.322
God, you look lovely, Lucy.

13:43.323 --> 13:46.676
I look dreadful. I haven't
been to bed all night.

14:14.771 --> 14:17.465
Now. Now, for the stairs.

15:18.793 --> 15:20.210
This is the last one.

15:20.211 --> 15:23.797
And lucky for you, 'cause
I'm not a bloody machine.

15:45.528 --> 15:47.737
Pushed along by the
storm, no doubt.

15:47.738 --> 15:50.866
No storm could have caused
that captain's throat wound.

15:50.867 --> 15:52.284
I've never seen
anything so ghastly.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.828
Oh, please, Jonathan,
not before dinner.

15:54.829 --> 15:56.413
I'm sorry.

15:56.414 --> 15:59.916
And, Dr. Seward, that wolf
or dog or whatever it was...

15:59.917 --> 16:01.668
Oh, a dog, I'm sure.

16:01.669 --> 16:04.271
Probably the ship's mascot.

16:22.899 --> 16:24.733
Early this morning, that big dog

16:24.734 --> 16:26.401
belonging to the
dustman were found,

16:26.402 --> 16:28.069
dead as a doornail.

16:28.070 --> 16:29.821
Had its throat tore away.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.323
- Tore away?
- Aye.

16:31.324 --> 16:34.427
By some savage claw, they say.

16:35.745 --> 16:37.847
Count Dracula.

16:43.878 --> 16:45.775
Good evening.

16:50.885 --> 16:53.011
- Miss Seward.
- Good evening, Count.

16:53.012 --> 16:56.707
Dr. Seward. Miss Van Helsing.

16:57.808 --> 16:59.726
My savior.

16:59.727 --> 17:02.020
I trust you're feeling improved.

17:02.021 --> 17:05.315
Oh, yes. Thank you.

17:05.316 --> 17:07.917
I don't think she
looks well at all.

17:10.070 --> 17:11.946
Well, perhaps a trifle pale.

17:11.948 --> 17:14.406
Count Dracula, we
haven't actually met.

17:14.407 --> 17:15.742
Uh, this is, uh...

17:15.742 --> 17:18.744
Yes, Jonathan Harker,
my new English solicitor.

17:18.746 --> 17:20.247
I have enjoyed our correspondence.

17:20.248 --> 17:21.705
And I, too, I must say.

17:21.707 --> 17:23.250
I must thank you for finding me

17:23.251 --> 17:24.960
an extraordinary house
here in Whitby.

17:24.961 --> 17:26.252
It's a pleasure.

17:26.253 --> 17:28.421
I'm sorry.

17:28.422 --> 17:30.382
But I don't see how anyone,

17:30.383 --> 17:32.384
except possibly Milo Renfield,

17:32.385 --> 17:35.909
could spend even a
day at Carfax Abbey.

17:36.305 --> 17:39.891
A house, Miss Seward, cannot
be made habitable in a day.

17:39.892 --> 17:44.167
And after all, how few days
go to make up a century.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.439
Sorry, I don't understand.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.149
I am of an old family.

17:48.150 --> 17:51.629
To live in a new house would
be impossible for me.

17:51.904 --> 17:55.323
I got dinner hot, if anybody cares.

17:55.324 --> 17:58.368
I care, Mr. Swales. Come on, Lucy.

17:58.369 --> 18:01.142
Come along, Count. Food.

18:08.671 --> 18:10.739
Miss Van Helsing.

18:18.848 --> 18:21.850
It is difficult for me
to express precisely,

18:21.851 --> 18:25.812
but there seemed to be a doom over the
ship from the moment we left Varna.

18:25.813 --> 18:28.189
Count, um, some wine?
You haven't...

18:28.190 --> 18:30.963
No, thank you, Doctor.
I never drink wine.

18:31.277 --> 18:33.653
Before you arrived, we were
looking at the ship's log.

18:33.654 --> 18:35.864
- It wasn't lost at sea?
- No.

18:35.865 --> 18:38.950
The very last entry
was a strange word.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.953
A word that Mina thought
meant "undead."

18:41.954 --> 18:43.121
Undead?

18:43.122 --> 18:44.873
Yes. <i>Nosferatu.</i>

18:44.874 --> 18:47.042
Ah! It means, "not dead."

18:47.043 --> 18:48.335
You were right.

18:48.336 --> 18:51.713
No, with your permission and all
due respect to Miss Van Helsing...

18:51.714 --> 18:55.342
Yes, I'm quite finished, thank you.
There is a distinction.

18:55.343 --> 18:57.469
- The words "not dead," you see...
- Damn!

18:57.470 --> 18:59.413
...carry the simple meaning...

19:07.146 --> 19:11.733
Dead, undead. I don't care.
They all frighten me.

19:11.734 --> 19:13.631
Oh, I love to be frightened.

19:14.070 --> 19:15.796
Do you?

19:28.250 --> 19:30.877
This is written in an
obscure regional dialect.

19:30.878 --> 19:33.254
The captain was a
Magyar. I am Szekely.

19:33.255 --> 19:36.074
Unfortunately, I can't
translate it for you.

19:36.258 --> 19:38.235
Magyar.

19:38.386 --> 19:40.283
Szekely.

19:41.013 --> 19:44.366
I had no idea, Count, that
your country was so complex.

19:45.226 --> 19:48.124
Oh, yes, it is, Doctor, indeed.
It's very, very complex.

19:48.771 --> 19:50.998
- More coffee?
- Mmm.

19:54.402 --> 19:57.696
So, you've come to England,
Count, to settle down?

19:57.697 --> 19:59.989
To settle down? No, hardly that.

19:59.990 --> 20:02.867
I've come to wander through
the crowded streets of London,

20:02.868 --> 20:06.871
or to be here, in the midst of
the whirl and rush of humanity.

20:06.872 --> 20:10.976
To share its life,
its change, its death.

20:11.085 --> 20:12.794
You...

20:12.795 --> 20:16.148
You have a great
lust for life, Count.

20:17.967 --> 20:20.285
How well you phrase it.

20:24.765 --> 20:26.808
- Miss Van Helsing!
- Oh!

20:26.809 --> 20:28.893
- Mina.
- I'm all right.

20:28.894 --> 20:31.312
I'm all right. I'm just dizzy.

20:31.313 --> 20:32.480
Swales, get the laudanum.

20:32.481 --> 20:33.815
No. No drugs.

20:33.816 --> 20:37.761
You must not pollute her blood.
Put her here on the couch.

20:47.329 --> 20:53.026
Forgive me, Doctor. You see, in my
country, we are a simpler people.

20:55.671 --> 20:57.172
The strain of the last day has been

20:57.173 --> 20:58.798
too much for you, Miss Van Helsing.

20:58.799 --> 21:00.341
And I am the cause, I fear.

21:00.342 --> 21:01.760
No, no, no. It's just...

21:01.761 --> 21:04.429
It's just this...
This pain in my head.

21:04.430 --> 21:05.847
It runs down here into my neck.

21:05.848 --> 21:07.098
I can remove this pain.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.850
Yes, and so can I.
Swales, get my...

21:08.851 --> 21:11.811
No. Such pains yield
readily to suggestion.

21:11.812 --> 21:14.631
If you mean hypnotism, she'd
be better off having the pain.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.191
Why?

21:16.192 --> 21:20.012
I suspect Mr. Harker thinks
of some ugly waving of arms.

21:20.196 --> 21:22.238
That is not my method.

21:22.239 --> 21:24.967
Now, look at me.

21:27.912 --> 21:31.539
When I will you to do a
thing, it shall be done.

21:31.540 --> 21:33.892
Hear and obey.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.979
From now on, you have no pain.

21:38.214 --> 21:41.174
- And no will of her own, either.
- Lucy!

21:41.175 --> 21:43.593
I admire your candor, Miss Seward.

21:43.594 --> 21:45.386
It is precisely the
kind of stimulating

21:45.387 --> 21:47.472
encounter I'd hoped to
find here in England.

21:47.473 --> 21:49.057
- Indeed.
- Yes, indeed.

21:49.058 --> 21:52.411
I despise women
with no life in them.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.795
No blood.

21:55.105 --> 21:58.254
When you awake,
you will remember nothing.

22:17.920 --> 22:21.130
Good Lord! Was it
something that I said?

22:21.131 --> 22:24.133
Now, Mr. Harker, come.
We must talk seriously.

22:24.134 --> 22:26.261
I want to sign the deed to
my new home here in England.

22:26.262 --> 22:29.222
- Of course.
- Tonight? I won't hear of it.

22:29.223 --> 22:33.373
This was meant to be a party
to welcome our new neighbor.

22:35.479 --> 22:37.456
Come, Count.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.149
Come and dance with me.

22:40.150 --> 22:43.236
- But I hardly know...
- It doesn't matter. I'll teach you.

22:53.539 --> 22:55.290
I meant,

22:55.291 --> 22:57.359
I hardly know you.

23:03.841 --> 23:05.784
Nonsense.

24:52.491 --> 24:55.014
Jonathan?

25:02.001 --> 25:04.023
Jonathan?

25:15.973 --> 25:17.790
Boo!

25:17.850 --> 25:19.809
Oh, my God, Jonathan!

25:19.810 --> 25:21.811
- Don't ever do that!
- Oh.

25:21.812 --> 25:24.506
I thought you loved
to be frightened.

25:25.441 --> 25:28.609
I think I shall go back
to bed, Mr. Harker.

25:28.610 --> 25:30.278
Mr. Harker, is it?

25:30.279 --> 25:34.282
I see. Looks like I'm not gonna be good
enough for the likes of you anymore.

25:34.283 --> 25:37.102
Hobnobbing with
royalty now, are we?

25:37.703 --> 25:40.121
Really, Jonathan, you pretend
to be so utterly modern.

25:40.122 --> 25:43.232
- We were just dancing.
- Just dancing!

25:43.292 --> 25:45.543
That's a right amazing
way of putting it.

25:45.544 --> 25:49.239
Do you know, Jonathan,
if you go on being cross,

25:51.133 --> 25:55.011
you're going to sprout
the most enormous wart

25:55.012 --> 25:58.411
right on the end of your nose.

29:11.667 --> 29:13.000
It's nothing.

29:16.797 --> 29:18.740
It's just a dog.

30:23.905 --> 30:26.223
Bloody hell, that hurts.

30:36.960 --> 30:39.153
Bloody heck.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.195
Pump.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.499
Oh...

30:58.565 --> 31:00.337
Oh.

31:01.443 --> 31:03.215
Here we go.

31:04.112 --> 31:06.009
Here we go.

31:07.449 --> 31:11.804
Nice and fat and juicy.

31:24.015 --> 31:26.063
Good evening.

31:28.970 --> 31:31.243
It will not open.

31:31.306 --> 31:33.453
You have nothing to fear.

31:33.475 --> 31:35.059
I'm accustomed to barring my home.

31:35.060 --> 31:37.144
There are wolves in Transylvania.

31:37.145 --> 31:38.771
Not here, there ain't.

31:38.772 --> 31:40.965
You must have patience with me.

31:41.108 --> 31:43.710
You must try to understand me.

31:44.444 --> 31:48.014
I can reward you with
a long and fruitful life,

31:48.323 --> 31:50.891
but I must have your loyalty.

31:51.159 --> 31:53.227
Can you give that?

31:55.997 --> 31:58.065
Then come.

32:00.961 --> 32:02.628
I've been bit by a bat.

32:02.629 --> 32:04.776
Yes, I see.

32:09.344 --> 32:12.618
Go on, then, lads. Let
the dog see the rabbit.

32:18.270 --> 32:19.979
Good morning, Dad. We got that.

32:19.980 --> 32:22.127
Good morning, Burt.

32:23.859 --> 32:26.193
- Morning, Billy, lad.
- Tally-ho.

32:26.194 --> 32:29.968
Come now! Mind yourself!
Mind where you're going!

32:41.209 --> 32:42.810
Mina?

32:50.051 --> 32:53.404
What is it? Mina, what's
wrong? What is it?

32:54.222 --> 32:57.450
The moonlight...
And the flapping...

32:57.559 --> 33:00.895
Papa! Papa, come quickly!

33:00.896 --> 33:02.730
Darling, try and tell
me what's wrong.

33:02.731 --> 33:04.398
- I... I...
- What is it?

33:05.901 --> 33:08.094
Papa, come quickly!

33:08.487 --> 33:10.237
- Papa, help her!
- What's wrong with her?

33:10.238 --> 33:11.572
She can't breathe.

33:13.742 --> 33:16.076
My throat pains me so.

33:16.077 --> 33:17.745
I can't get any air.

33:17.746 --> 33:19.371
There's plenty. Take a deep breath.

33:19.372 --> 33:20.664
- What happened?
- I don't know.

33:20.665 --> 33:21.916
She's so white. Asphyxia.

33:21.917 --> 33:23.501
Just breathe in, darling.
Just breathe.

33:23.502 --> 33:24.835
Mina, breathe.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.462
- Breathe, please.
- Try!

33:26.463 --> 33:29.006
- Mina, breathe! Breathe! Mina!
- Try, darling.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.966
- Mina, breathe, breathe!
- I can't breathe!

33:30.967 --> 33:32.218
Oh, Papa, stop it!

33:32.219 --> 33:33.928
- Breathe!
- Oh, Father, be careful!

33:33.929 --> 33:35.846
Breathe! Mina, Mina! Breathe!

33:35.847 --> 33:37.765
Oh, Papa, stop it!

33:37.766 --> 33:39.600
Breathe, breathe.

33:39.601 --> 33:41.769
- Try, darling, just...
- Breathe.

33:41.770 --> 33:43.270
Breathe.

33:50.362 --> 33:53.135
Oh, my God, Papa. She's dead.

34:04.834 --> 34:06.981
Look at her throat!

34:07.629 --> 34:09.481
Two punctures.

34:11.507 --> 34:14.592
Not very large, but not wholesome.

34:14.594 --> 34:17.596
Not wholesome, Papa?
What are you talking about?

34:17.597 --> 34:20.871
Jonathan, get her out
of here. Jonathan, please.

34:36.783 --> 34:39.243
12, Van Briggle Strasse, Amsterdam.

34:39.244 --> 34:41.495
Yes, Professor Abraham Van Helsing.

34:41.496 --> 34:45.225
Now, read the whole thing
back to me like a good girl.

34:46.208 --> 34:47.793
Nothing for me, thank you.

34:47.793 --> 34:50.337
Come on. You need your strength.

34:50.338 --> 34:52.005
I should never have left her alone.

34:52.007 --> 34:54.967
That's preposterous!
You had no way of knowing.

34:54.967 --> 34:59.138
Mina has died. No, not lied! Died!

34:59.139 --> 35:01.181
Telegraph or come at once.

35:01.182 --> 35:05.102
Your dear friend in this saddest
of occasions, Jack Seward. Yes.

35:05.103 --> 35:07.855
Well, I do hope the
professor gets it.

35:07.856 --> 35:09.690
The poor, poor man.

35:09.691 --> 35:11.191
Poor Mina.

35:11.192 --> 35:13.794
Do you think it was
her heart, Doctor?

35:14.029 --> 35:16.196
Or that pain in her
head last night?

35:16.197 --> 35:19.033
I don't know. It's so long since
I've practiced real medicine.

35:19.034 --> 35:20.826
What do you think killed her?

35:20.827 --> 35:23.495
Killed her? That's an odd word.

35:23.496 --> 35:24.997
Yet there was no sign of disease.

35:24.998 --> 35:26.832
What about those marks on her neck?

35:26.833 --> 35:28.334
Marks on her neck.

35:28.335 --> 35:31.879
Hmm. Perhaps she injured
herself fastening her shawl.

35:31.880 --> 35:34.232
Oh, Father, don't be absurd.

35:34.507 --> 35:36.700
You saw those wounds.

36:59.801 --> 37:01.493
Hello?

37:03.930 --> 37:05.702
Hello?

37:16.443 --> 37:18.590
Is anyone at home?

37:26.411 --> 37:28.183
Hello?

37:34.002 --> 37:35.502
Count Dracula!

37:35.503 --> 37:38.447
You needn't shout, Mr. Harker.

37:38.673 --> 37:40.299
You frightened me.

37:40.300 --> 37:42.197
I'm sorry.

37:42.927 --> 37:46.576
I had a key. I had
to let myself in.

37:47.515 --> 37:49.850
I wonder where Renfield can be.

37:49.851 --> 37:51.351
I don't know.

37:51.352 --> 37:52.811
I knocked, but he didn't...

37:52.812 --> 37:54.188
Yes, well, the man is worthless.

37:54.189 --> 37:57.649
It doesn't matter. At any rate,
you are here. Welcome. Come up.

37:57.650 --> 37:59.422
Thank you.

38:10.830 --> 38:12.456
Hello.

38:12.457 --> 38:14.041
Good evening.

38:14.042 --> 38:16.502
I'm sorry to hear of Miss
Van Helsing's death.

38:16.503 --> 38:17.878
You know already?

38:17.879 --> 38:20.607
Yes. News of death travels fast.

38:20.882 --> 38:22.883
She was very ill.

38:22.884 --> 38:25.385
I could tell last night when
I looked into her eyes.

38:25.386 --> 38:28.239
Yeah. She'd been
frail all her life.

38:29.224 --> 38:32.703
Oh, your key. I only had it
to inspect the property.

38:32.727 --> 38:35.896
Yes, of course. Have you
brought the original deed?

38:35.897 --> 38:37.874
Here.

38:38.650 --> 38:41.628
If you'd like to
sign at the bottom.

38:41.736 --> 38:44.029
And some customs documents
for your crates.

38:44.030 --> 38:46.849
Now, I didn't know what
to say of their contents.

38:47.033 --> 38:49.510
- Soil.
- Soil?

38:49.869 --> 38:51.453
Just plain dirt.

38:51.454 --> 38:53.038
Transylvanian earth.

38:53.039 --> 38:55.082
I have a keen interest in botany.

38:55.083 --> 38:57.417
Can you drive to London at
once to record the deed?

38:57.418 --> 38:59.190
No.

38:59.420 --> 39:02.840
Tomorrow. I must stay
with Lucy for the funeral.

39:02.841 --> 39:05.364
Oh, yes. Of course.

39:06.052 --> 39:07.845
- She's taking it...
- Not well.

39:07.846 --> 39:10.119
She blames herself.

39:10.515 --> 39:14.289
She was with me when
Mina was taken ill.

39:15.520 --> 39:19.374
I see. And you and Miss
Seward will marry?

39:19.816 --> 39:21.859
Yeah, I suppose so.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.777
If I can ever persuade her
to settle down long enough.

39:23.778 --> 39:27.239
Yes. She is stronger than
most women, isn't she?

39:27.240 --> 39:29.467
Yes, she is.

39:30.577 --> 39:32.119
I must be getting back now.

39:32.120 --> 39:35.455
Mr. Harker, would you deliver
this letter to Dr. Seward for me?

39:35.456 --> 39:36.582
Of course.

39:36.583 --> 39:38.292
I should like to offer
his daughter and he

39:38.293 --> 39:40.627
the hospitality of my
home after the funeral.

39:40.628 --> 39:44.448
You're welcome, of course, but
you are leaving, are you not?

39:52.932 --> 39:55.830
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

40:08.823 --> 40:10.490
I want you to help me!

40:10.491 --> 40:12.284
Take me away from
this cursed place!

40:12.285 --> 40:14.161
Let go of me, you bloody idiot!

40:14.162 --> 40:16.455
You've got to help me!
You've got to help me!

40:16.456 --> 40:19.775
You've got to save me!
You've got to save me!

40:20.501 --> 40:23.921
Please, you've got to help me!
Help me get away from...

40:46.861 --> 40:49.304
Get him in the clink, Mr. Swales.

40:54.577 --> 40:56.870
Hold the door, Dr.
Seward. Quick, please.

40:56.871 --> 40:58.538
Let me go! Please!

40:58.539 --> 41:00.686
Get him in! Come on!

41:00.917 --> 41:04.544
The stench in here! Don't you
ever clean it out, Swales?

41:04.545 --> 41:06.380
Hold him! Hold him there!

41:06.381 --> 41:10.986
The master's angry. He promised
me lives, not little ones.

41:11.094 --> 41:14.888
Flies and spiders, but
big ones. Human lives.

41:14.889 --> 41:17.432
"I am the resurrection
and the life.

41:17.433 --> 41:22.062
"He that believeth in me, yea, though
he were dead, yet shall he live.

41:22.063 --> 41:25.524
"And whosoever believeth
in me shall never die."

41:25.525 --> 41:27.776
"I know that my redeemer liveth,

41:27.777 --> 41:30.445
"and that I shall rise out of
the earth on the last day,

41:30.446 --> 41:32.572
"and shall be covered
again with my skin

41:32.573 --> 41:35.346
"and shall see the
Lord in my flesh."

41:35.410 --> 41:37.494
"Behold, I show you a mystery.

41:37.495 --> 41:40.789
"When the trumpet shall sound, the
dead shall be raised incorruptible,

41:40.790 --> 41:42.249
"and we shall be changed.

41:42.250 --> 41:48.027
"Then shall be brought to pass that
which says, 'Death, where is thy sting?

41:48.047 --> 41:50.882
"'0, grave, where is thy victory?"'

41:52.552 --> 41:54.219
I don't see why not.

41:54.220 --> 41:55.929
For God's sake, Lucy,
it'll do you no good

41:55.930 --> 41:57.931
to stay around here
feeling sorry for yourself.

41:57.932 --> 41:59.391
Feeling guilty for no reason.

41:59.392 --> 42:02.894
You don't understand, Jonathan.
I don't want to feel happy,

42:02.895 --> 42:05.814
to feel silly. Not now.

42:05.815 --> 42:07.524
Then I'll come back tomorrow night.

42:07.525 --> 42:09.877
You needn't, I can manage.

42:10.153 --> 42:11.925
Can you?

42:14.824 --> 42:17.847
Jonathan, let's not part enemies.

42:18.036 --> 42:20.513
We're not enemies.

42:24.625 --> 42:26.568
Lucy.

42:27.086 --> 42:28.938
Oh, Lucy.

42:29.172 --> 42:32.799
Mina's father, uh,
Professor Van Helsing,

42:32.800 --> 42:36.053
is arriving from Paris this evening,
and we shall have to meet him.

42:36.054 --> 42:38.346
I'm afraid we shall be
unable to take advantage of

42:38.347 --> 42:40.849
Count Dracula's kind
invitation to dinner.

42:40.850 --> 42:42.476
Invitation to dinner?

42:42.477 --> 42:44.102
- You didn't tell me...
- Didn't I?

42:44.103 --> 42:47.147
Well, it doesn't matter now, I'll
have to send word around excusing us.

42:47.148 --> 42:48.800
- No, I'll go.
- Go?

42:48.801 --> 42:51.602
- I should have thought you'd rather...
- As a courtesy.

42:54.989 --> 42:58.325
He's sending a carriage
round at 8:00.

42:58.326 --> 43:00.644
So, if you, uh...

44:13.192 --> 44:15.110
Whitby. Whitby.

44:15.111 --> 44:17.195
This is Whitby station.

44:17.196 --> 44:19.114
This train will call
at Scarborough,

44:19.115 --> 44:21.616
Bridlington and Kingston upon Hull.

44:21.617 --> 44:23.118
Ah, porter.

44:23.119 --> 44:24.578
Whitby. Whitby.

44:24.579 --> 44:27.682
There are two
portmanteaux in there.

44:31.043 --> 44:32.769
Abraham!

44:33.254 --> 44:35.322
Abraham.

44:36.257 --> 44:37.924
In my own house.

44:37.925 --> 44:40.198
How can I ever...

44:40.344 --> 44:42.262
What happened?

44:42.263 --> 44:44.764
What in God's name
could have happened?

44:44.765 --> 44:46.683
I don't know, I don't know.

44:46.684 --> 44:48.935
Jack, Jack, you must explain to me.

44:48.936 --> 44:50.937
I insist. From the beginning.

44:50.938 --> 44:53.381
- As patiently as you can.
- I am baffled.

46:06.764 --> 46:08.139
Hello?

46:17.900 --> 46:19.717
Hello?

46:27.702 --> 46:30.054
Is anyone here?

46:31.622 --> 46:33.815
Count Dracula?

46:35.126 --> 46:37.194
Good evening.

46:39.130 --> 46:41.589
Welcome to Carfax
Abbey, Miss Seward.

46:41.590 --> 46:42.966
Thank you.

46:42.967 --> 46:46.992
I regret Mr. Harker and your
father were unable to join us.

46:47.388 --> 46:49.831
Let me see to your comfort.

46:57.023 --> 47:00.900
Of course, you examined
her with great care.

47:00.901 --> 47:04.070
There were no
functional causes. None.

47:04.071 --> 47:06.448
She'd been nervous certainly.

47:06.449 --> 47:08.241
- Sleepwalking.
- Sleepwalking?

47:08.242 --> 47:10.994
Nightmares. I prescribed laudanum.

47:10.995 --> 47:12.996
What? Laudanum?

47:12.997 --> 47:15.440
For nervous prostration.

47:16.584 --> 47:20.108
But a great loss of blood...

47:20.755 --> 47:22.777
How?

47:25.468 --> 47:27.536
Mina was so young.

47:28.095 --> 47:29.929
So are you.

47:29.930 --> 47:31.765
Tonight, I feel positively ancient.

47:31.766 --> 47:34.960
There are worse things than
death. You must believe me.

47:35.227 --> 47:37.270
If there are, I can't imagine them.

47:37.271 --> 47:41.216
I have buried many friends,
and I, too, am weary.

47:41.442 --> 47:43.840
I am the last of my kind,

47:44.403 --> 47:47.176
descended from a conquering race.

47:47.281 --> 47:52.102
My family was its heart's
blood, its brains, its swords.

47:52.286 --> 47:54.888
But the warlike days are over.

47:58.084 --> 48:00.251
Anyway, it's not healthy
to live in the past.

48:00.252 --> 48:02.104
No, it isn't.

48:02.505 --> 48:05.173
Jonathan Harker tells me
you speak some Rumanian.

48:05.174 --> 48:07.744
Oh, hardly...

48:11.347 --> 48:12.764
There, you do understand.

48:12.765 --> 48:14.933
No, really, I have no
idea what you said.

48:14.934 --> 48:18.083
I said it would be
nice to see you smile.

48:22.650 --> 48:23.858
Then you should be pleased.

48:23.859 --> 48:25.756
Oh, I am.

48:26.153 --> 48:28.926
But I must warn you to take care.

48:29.323 --> 48:31.175
Whatever for?

48:32.118 --> 48:34.744
If at any time my company
does not please you,

48:34.745 --> 48:37.689
you will have only
yourself to blame,

48:38.040 --> 48:41.940
for an acquaintance who
seldom forces himself,

48:42.670 --> 48:45.272
but is difficult to be rid of.

48:58.686 --> 49:01.771
Murder! She's murdered my baby!

49:01.772 --> 49:03.440
What's going on here?

49:03.441 --> 49:05.024
Stop her! Stop her!

49:05.025 --> 49:06.693
Help me! She's murdered my baby!

49:06.694 --> 49:08.361
My God, no, Annie!

49:10.656 --> 49:12.198
Annie! No!

49:12.199 --> 49:13.867
No, Annie! Annie!

49:13.868 --> 49:15.493
Stop her! She killed him!

49:15.494 --> 49:17.704
No, Annie! Please don't!

49:22.710 --> 49:25.062
What's happening?

49:28.048 --> 49:31.176
Two punctures directly
into the aorta?

49:31.177 --> 49:34.137
She just opened the door
like she had a key!

49:34.138 --> 49:36.055
She said could she
have my little Alex.

49:36.056 --> 49:37.932
No, no, no. Please, please.

49:39.560 --> 49:42.395
And she was as hot
as a burning coal,

49:42.396 --> 49:45.023
and her eyes were red like rubies,

49:45.024 --> 49:49.027
and her lips all drawn back
and her breath so foul.

49:49.028 --> 49:51.863
And she had these
long dreadful teeth

49:51.864 --> 49:56.409
like fangs of a wolf,
like nothing from this earth.

49:56.410 --> 49:58.870
Then she grabbed him
and I grabbed her.

49:58.871 --> 50:01.331
And the next thing I remembered,
she's kneeling on the floor.

50:01.332 --> 50:04.042
This woman, you did not know her?

50:04.043 --> 50:07.212
Yes, I did. I did so.

50:07.213 --> 50:10.423
It was Miss Lucy's friend, Mina,

50:10.424 --> 50:13.218
that we put in the earth yesterday.

50:25.898 --> 50:27.750
Listen to them.

50:28.901 --> 50:31.299
The children of the night.

50:31.612 --> 50:34.055
What sad music they make.

50:34.573 --> 50:36.032
Do you think it's sad?

50:36.033 --> 50:39.603
So lonely, like weeping.

50:40.412 --> 50:43.060
I think it's a wonderful sound.

50:47.711 --> 50:51.297
I really love the night.
It's so simple.

50:51.298 --> 50:53.195
So deceptive.

50:57.054 --> 50:58.951
So exciting!

50:59.014 --> 51:01.599
You take the dawn for granted.

51:01.600 --> 51:03.793
The warm, hot sunlight.

51:04.436 --> 51:06.208
Ah.

51:06.647 --> 51:07.981
But the night...

51:07.982 --> 51:10.380
- Was made to enjoy.
- Yes.

51:10.568 --> 51:12.511
Yes, it was.

51:12.903 --> 51:15.301
It was made to enjoy life

51:17.575 --> 51:19.472
and love.

51:23.872 --> 51:27.146
Look at me. Look.

51:53.694 --> 51:55.778
- You must forgive me.
- What for?

51:55.779 --> 51:58.222
For intruding on your life.

51:58.282 --> 52:01.101
I came of my own accord.

52:14.590 --> 52:16.549
You should perhaps go.

52:16.550 --> 52:17.925
No, I'd rather stay.

52:17.926 --> 52:21.012
- It will be light soon.
- Not for hours yet.

52:21.013 --> 52:23.286
I will see you again.

52:24.558 --> 52:26.660
Oh, please.

52:39.365 --> 52:41.342
Abraham?

52:42.618 --> 52:44.595
Ah, Jack.

52:45.287 --> 52:47.330
Will you take some breakfast?

52:47.331 --> 52:49.999
Oh, yes, thank you, Jackie.

52:50.000 --> 52:54.605
A little later, perhaps,
if you please. Thank you.

53:20.280 --> 53:22.198
Professor,

53:22.199 --> 53:25.894
you should come inside now,
it's getting very cold.

53:26.787 --> 53:31.062
I was just sitting
a while with Mina.

53:41.135 --> 53:42.802
What are these?

53:42.803 --> 53:48.000
Ah! Those tiny flowers are
from the garlic plant.

53:48.058 --> 53:49.910
Whatever for?

53:51.812 --> 53:55.982
Do you believe in
corporeal transference?

53:55.983 --> 53:58.985
- No.
- In materialization?

53:58.986 --> 54:03.261
- No.
- And not in astral bodies?

54:03.574 --> 54:05.658
What is this to do with Mina?

54:05.659 --> 54:08.161
You know the legends
of central Europe

54:08.162 --> 54:12.373
of the werewolves and vampires.

54:12.374 --> 54:14.041
Vampires?

54:14.042 --> 54:18.572
Creatures who suck the
blood of the living.

54:20.048 --> 54:21.313
You aren't saying
that you believe...

54:21.314 --> 54:23.740
- that Mina was attacked by...
- A creature that is dead...

54:23.741 --> 54:26.763
and yet not dead, a thing
that lives after its death

54:26.764 --> 54:28.389
- by drinking...
- Oh, no!

54:28.390 --> 54:29.849
It must have blood,

54:29.850 --> 54:32.018
- or it dies an agonizing death.
- Please, stop.

54:32.019 --> 54:33.791
Miss Lucy?

54:36.482 --> 54:41.258
I wonder if I may?

54:42.154 --> 54:46.349
This was to be Mina's

54:46.700 --> 54:48.677
for her birthday.

54:48.827 --> 54:53.206
She would want you to have it

54:53.207 --> 54:56.310
and to wear it always.

54:59.421 --> 55:01.238
Always.

55:36.625 --> 55:38.668
Good evening, Miss.

55:38.669 --> 55:40.521
Good evening.

55:42.965 --> 55:44.987
I am Count Dracula.

55:45.259 --> 55:47.486
Abraham Van Helsing.

55:48.929 --> 55:51.848
Then it is your daughter,
sir, who brings me here.

55:51.849 --> 55:54.543
I have come to pay my respects.

55:58.772 --> 56:01.374
What is that around your neck?

56:01.692 --> 56:03.276
This?

56:03.277 --> 56:06.255
It's a gift from
Professor Van Helsing.

56:08.156 --> 56:09.882
How kind.

56:09.950 --> 56:14.100
We were just going inside.
Perhaps you'd like to join us?

56:14.288 --> 56:16.390
No, thank you.

56:17.165 --> 56:19.333
With your permission, sir.

56:19.334 --> 56:21.481
With my blessing.

56:29.177 --> 56:31.637
Do sit down, Professor.
I'll bring you some tea.

56:31.638 --> 56:34.912
Thank you, Miss Lucy.

57:13.972 --> 57:16.390
Abraham, this is nonsense!

57:16.391 --> 57:18.493
This is witchcraft!

57:18.644 --> 57:21.187
This beast can tell us nothing.

57:21.188 --> 57:24.132
There are no such
things as vampires.

58:18.662 --> 58:21.247
There's nothing but the
Lord's own dead out here.

58:21.248 --> 58:23.020
I can't hold him!

58:23.041 --> 58:25.609
Let him go, man!

58:29.006 --> 58:30.631
What if he should break a leg?

58:30.632 --> 58:32.508
He won't.

58:32.509 --> 58:35.282
Look, how alert!

58:38.932 --> 58:41.434
You see, he knows.

58:41.435 --> 58:43.602
He will find out where
lies the vampire

58:43.603 --> 58:48.629
just as surely as you, Jack Seward,
could palpate a human cancer.

59:11.631 --> 59:15.735
Stop him! Dear God
in heaven, stop him.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:13.543
Now, it is you, my
best beloved one.

01:00:15.362 --> 01:00:18.590
You will be flesh of my flesh,

01:00:18.949 --> 01:00:21.267
blood of my blood.

01:00:21.785 --> 01:00:26.982
You shall cross land or
sea to do my bidding.

01:01:17.591 --> 01:01:19.693
I need your blood.

01:01:20.635 --> 01:01:22.578
I need...

01:03:59.377 --> 01:04:01.754
Give me a wrenching iron, Jack.

01:04:01.755 --> 01:04:03.902
Hold up the cross.

01:04:22.859 --> 01:04:25.757
That's not possible.
I saw her put...

01:04:25.779 --> 01:04:27.926
Body snatchers!

01:04:39.501 --> 01:04:41.210
The mines!

01:04:41.211 --> 01:04:44.564
They run underneath the
entire town, everywhere.

01:04:47.842 --> 01:04:52.743
No! No, Abraham, please!
I beg of you. No!

01:06:12.594 --> 01:06:14.320
The cross.

01:06:14.721 --> 01:06:16.743
The cross!

01:06:40.455 --> 01:06:42.181
Mina?

01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:46.022
Papa.

01:07:08.107 --> 01:07:09.483
Mina, no!

01:07:42.475 --> 01:07:44.668
Papa.

01:08:16.384 --> 01:08:17.926
- Mr. Harker.
- Mrs. Galloway,

01:08:17.926 --> 01:08:20.386
I'm sorry to knock you up at
this hour, but is Miss Lucy...

01:08:20.388 --> 01:08:21.888
In her room, sound asleep.

01:08:21.889 --> 01:08:24.308
Which is where we should all be,
if we had more common sense.

01:08:24.309 --> 01:08:25.642
Yes, you're right.

01:08:25.643 --> 01:08:28.437
I think I'll do the same. I'll
wait till morning to say hello.

01:08:28.438 --> 01:08:30.381
Good night.

01:08:38.363 --> 01:08:40.090
Lucy?

01:08:40.408 --> 01:08:42.385
It's Jonathan.

01:08:42.910 --> 01:08:44.636
Lucy?

01:08:47.497 --> 01:08:49.770
Lucy, what's the matter?

01:08:50.167 --> 01:08:51.939
Lucy!

01:08:53.212 --> 01:08:55.671
Lucy, what is it? Lucy!

01:08:55.673 --> 01:08:58.696
- Come, Abraham, we need to get...
- Lucy!

01:08:59.135 --> 01:09:00.510
- Jonathan.
- Dr. Seward.

01:09:00.511 --> 01:09:03.580
- Thank God, you're back.
- Doctor, quickly. Lucy, she's so cold.

01:09:05.642 --> 01:09:07.538
Professor.

01:09:10.563 --> 01:09:13.564
She has lost a great deal of blood.

01:09:13.566 --> 01:09:16.009
There's scarcely any pulse.

01:09:22.533 --> 01:09:24.618
She'll have to be given
a blood transfusion.

01:09:24.618 --> 01:09:27.578
Pray to God that one
of us has her type.

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:29.352
Swales!

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:32.104
Swales!

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.768
Take these and rub them against

01:09:49.769 --> 01:09:52.104
the inside of all
doors and windows.

01:09:52.104 --> 01:09:54.189
Crush them against
the glass, so that

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:56.233
the fragrance permeates
the whole room

01:09:56.234 --> 01:09:59.111
and keeps away all evil, and don't
forget the little room in there.

01:09:59.112 --> 01:10:00.862
Oh, good God, Professor.
Not garlic.

01:10:00.863 --> 01:10:02.572
I'm sick to my stomach as it is.

01:10:02.573 --> 01:10:04.574
Are you feeling weak?

01:10:04.575 --> 01:10:05.992
No, it doesn't matter.

01:10:05.993 --> 01:10:09.037
She needs more than
your blood, Jonathan.

01:10:09.038 --> 01:10:10.580
What she doesn't need is to breathe

01:10:10.581 --> 01:10:12.249
the odor from those
wretched plants.

01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:16.946
Do not trifle with me. There
is a grim purpose in all I do.

01:10:24.137 --> 01:10:27.581
- Just a little bit longer.
- All right.

01:11:05.762 --> 01:11:07.137
Ah, the devil.

01:11:07.138 --> 01:11:10.457
I'm not as bad as that.

01:11:11.517 --> 01:11:14.620
I did not hear you come in, Count.

01:11:15.688 --> 01:11:19.087
I am often told I have
a light footstep.

01:11:19.108 --> 01:11:21.818
I was looking in the mirror.

01:11:21.819 --> 01:11:26.424
It reflects the whole room,
and yet I cannot see...

01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:35.979
Forgive me, Doctor.
I dislike mirrors.

01:11:36.083 --> 01:11:39.186
They are the playthings
of man's vanity.

01:11:39.921 --> 01:11:44.841
You are a most unusual
creature, Count Dracula.

01:11:44.842 --> 01:11:46.534
Yes.

01:11:48.262 --> 01:11:50.013
How is the fair patient?

01:11:50.014 --> 01:11:53.016
Her diagnosis presents
difficulties.

01:11:53.017 --> 01:11:54.935
I feared it might, my friend.

01:11:54.936 --> 01:11:58.897
Would you care to see what
I have prescribed for her?

01:11:58.898 --> 01:12:01.107
Anything that you
prescribe for Miss Lucy

01:12:01.108 --> 01:12:03.276
has the greatest interest for me.

01:12:03.277 --> 01:12:07.364
My prescription is a
most unusual one.

01:12:17.542 --> 01:12:20.486
You are a wise man, Professor,

01:12:21.045 --> 01:12:24.256
for one who has not lived
even a single lifetime.

01:12:24.257 --> 01:12:25.799
You flatter me, Count.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:28.051
But not wise enough to
return to Holland at once,

01:12:28.052 --> 01:12:30.178
now that you have learned
what you have learned.

01:12:30.179 --> 01:12:32.452
I prefer to remain.

01:12:35.101 --> 01:12:38.061
In the past 500 years, Professor,

01:12:38.062 --> 01:12:41.481
those who have crossed
my path have all died,

01:12:41.482 --> 01:12:44.276
and some not pleasantly.

01:12:44.277 --> 01:12:46.129
Come here!

01:13:11.929 --> 01:13:14.156
Your will is strong.

01:13:15.725 --> 01:13:18.202
Then I must come to you.

01:13:37.997 --> 01:13:40.099
Sacrilege.

01:13:40.166 --> 01:13:42.000
Sacrilege!

01:13:53.846 --> 01:13:57.474
Abraham, the color's
returning to Lucy's cheeks.

01:13:57.475 --> 01:13:59.247
Professor?

01:14:01.062 --> 01:14:04.461
Abraham, what has happened to you?

01:14:04.649 --> 01:14:06.691
Dracula has been here.

01:14:06.692 --> 01:14:08.234
What for?

01:14:08.235 --> 01:14:10.153
- He came to kill me.
- What?

01:14:10.154 --> 01:14:12.722
It is he who is the vampire.

01:14:12.907 --> 01:14:15.742
Abraham, this night has
been a monstrous...

01:14:15.743 --> 01:14:20.098
He came to kill me, and now
he will prey upon you.

01:14:20.539 --> 01:14:22.516
What's happening?

01:14:23.501 --> 01:14:27.696
Please, for God's sake! Will
someone tell me what is happening?

01:14:59.328 --> 01:15:00.870
She looks...

01:15:00.871 --> 01:15:02.688
Alive?

01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:10.439
She's the devil's undead.

01:15:10.715 --> 01:15:12.817
<i>Nosferatu.</i>

01:15:15.428 --> 01:15:17.679
You can't seriously
expect me to believe that

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:19.889
Count Dracula is
some hideous monster.

01:15:19.890 --> 01:15:23.435
I don't expect you
to believe anything

01:15:23.436 --> 01:15:25.788
but what is.

01:15:53.299 --> 01:15:55.050
What are you gonna do?

01:15:55.051 --> 01:15:57.369
To save her soul,

01:15:58.929 --> 01:16:02.724
I must take out her heart.

01:16:02.725 --> 01:16:04.559
Heavens and earth, no!

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.144
It's not your choice.

01:16:06.145 --> 01:16:08.730
She was my daughter.
If we fail here,

01:16:08.731 --> 01:16:11.316
it is not merely a matter
of life and death,

01:16:11.317 --> 01:16:14.402
it is that we shall
become such as she.

01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:16.946
- That we and your Lucy...
- No, it's not possible!

01:16:16.947 --> 01:16:21.868
...may become foul things
of the night. There is work.

01:16:21.869 --> 01:16:25.063
Wild work to be done.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.852
And now,

01:16:31.170 --> 01:16:34.694
are the powers of all the devils

01:16:35.174 --> 01:16:37.321
against us.

01:16:55.611 --> 01:16:57.337
No!

01:17:02.785 --> 01:17:05.578
- Mrs. Galloway.
- Yes?

01:17:05.579 --> 01:17:07.080
Would you be kind enough to make me

01:17:07.081 --> 01:17:09.415
a cup of tea? I feel rather cold.

01:17:09.416 --> 01:17:10.875
No wonder.

01:17:10.876 --> 01:17:14.379
The doctor's orders were
that you should stay in bed.

01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:18.280
But how he thinks I could
keep you there, I don't know.

01:17:32.439 --> 01:17:34.482
- Mrs. Galloway.
- Good morning, Mr. Harker.

01:17:34.483 --> 01:17:36.276
- Where's Lucy? You're supposed...
- Oh, she's in her room.

01:17:36.277 --> 01:17:38.879
She's looking much better
and asking for tea.

01:17:53.961 --> 01:17:55.983
I'll get the car.

01:18:07.141 --> 01:18:09.368
Lucy, stop!

01:18:09.685 --> 01:18:12.754
For God's sake, Lucy! Stop!

01:18:22.281 --> 01:18:24.616
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

01:18:24.617 --> 01:18:26.701
Get out of my way, Jonathan.

01:18:26.702 --> 01:18:29.704
There! Now, you must believe me.

01:18:29.705 --> 01:18:31.873
Lucy, no. You can't
possibly go to him.

01:18:31.874 --> 01:18:33.750
He's no danger to me.

01:18:33.751 --> 01:18:35.293
He's a monster! A vampire!

01:18:35.294 --> 01:18:37.545
- You're fools, all of you!
- No!

01:18:37.546 --> 01:18:39.648
She means to warn him.

01:18:41.091 --> 01:18:44.069
Jonathan, if you try to stop me,

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:46.304
I shall kill myself.

01:18:46.305 --> 01:18:49.390
I charge you on your
living soul, Lucy Seward,

01:18:49.391 --> 01:18:52.644
that you do not die
or think of death

01:18:52.645 --> 01:18:54.604
until this great evil
which has fouled

01:18:54.605 --> 01:18:57.299
your life is true dead himself!

01:18:59.151 --> 01:19:01.653
You dare try to confuse me!

01:19:01.654 --> 01:19:05.073
Tormenting him who is the
saddest, the kindest of all.

01:19:05.074 --> 01:19:06.324
Kind?

01:19:06.325 --> 01:19:11.329
If I could send his soul to
everlasting, burning hell, I would!

01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:14.582
I despise you. All of you.
Get out of my way.

01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:17.126
- Lucy, no!
- Let me go!

01:19:17.127 --> 01:19:19.045
Let me go!

01:19:19.046 --> 01:19:21.172
You must not go.

01:19:21.173 --> 01:19:22.840
No!

01:19:22.841 --> 01:19:24.693
Be calm.

01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:27.579
Be calm.

01:19:35.271 --> 01:19:36.813
Take her home, Jack.

01:19:36.814 --> 01:19:38.314
Watch over her.

01:19:38.315 --> 01:19:39.816
Abraham, what are you going to do?

01:19:39.817 --> 01:19:43.296
Miss Lucy's life is at
stake and so is her soul.

01:19:43.487 --> 01:19:45.196
Jonathan and I must go and find

01:19:45.197 --> 01:19:48.175
this monster and
utterly destroy it.

01:20:13.976 --> 01:20:17.671
Oh, God, what a stench!

01:20:32.411 --> 01:20:36.265
Take the cross, Jonathan.
Take the cross.

01:21:45.984 --> 01:21:50.930
Gentlemen, how kind of you to call.

01:21:51.657 --> 01:21:56.077
I have underestimated your
powers, Count Dracula,

01:21:56.078 --> 01:21:58.788
to move about in daylight hours.

01:21:58.789 --> 01:22:02.291
It is always daylight somewhere
on Earth, Professor.

01:22:02.292 --> 01:22:05.896
After my rest, my need is
only to stay in darkness.

01:22:30.362 --> 01:22:31.779
You fools.

01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:36.033
Do you think with your crosses and
your wafers you can destroy me?

01:22:36.034 --> 01:22:37.760
Me!

01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:40.872
You do not know how many
men have come against me.

01:22:40.873 --> 01:22:43.207
I am the king of my kind!

01:22:43.208 --> 01:22:46.169
You have accomplished
nothing, Van Helsing.

01:22:46.170 --> 01:22:48.379
Time is on my side.

01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:50.882
In a century, when you are dust,

01:22:50.883 --> 01:22:54.635
I shall wake and call Lucy,
my queen, from her grave.

01:22:54.636 --> 01:22:56.637
- No.
- Yes.

01:22:56.638 --> 01:23:00.516
I have in my time had
many brides, Mr. Harker,

01:23:00.517 --> 01:23:03.019
but I shall set Lucy
above them all.

01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:05.122
You won't get Lucy.

01:23:05.731 --> 01:23:08.333
She's mine already.

01:23:08.734 --> 01:23:10.067
No!

01:23:21.246 --> 01:23:23.098
God!

01:23:31.507 --> 01:23:34.030
Damn you!

01:24:04.748 --> 01:24:08.648
Help me, Professor!

01:24:09.545 --> 01:24:12.068
Professor!

01:24:18.262 --> 01:24:20.079
Oh, no!

01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:06.548
But I helped him.

01:25:06.549 --> 01:25:09.687
I saw that two of those crates were
safely delivered from the ship.

01:25:09.688 --> 01:25:11.814
Yes, but you must
not blame yourself.

01:25:11.815 --> 01:25:15.359
He probably had other coffins
brought to him other ways.

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:16.819
You know this man's cunning.

01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:18.362
Pity my poor Lucy,
then. He's probably

01:25:18.363 --> 01:25:20.573
got them scattered all
over Whitby by now.

01:25:20.574 --> 01:25:24.678
Then we'll find them and
tear them open, one by one.

01:25:26.204 --> 01:25:29.206
- In there? She can't be so ill.
- I couldn't help it.

01:25:29.207 --> 01:25:32.168
When she came round, she
was like a wild thing.

01:25:32.169 --> 01:25:35.212
You have given her
medication? Laudanum?

01:25:35.213 --> 01:25:37.861
My own daughter? Certainly not.

01:25:40.594 --> 01:25:43.763
No, please. Can I have a
moment alone with her?

01:25:43.764 --> 01:25:45.931
Please, I must. I must.

01:25:45.932 --> 01:25:48.726
But remember, Jonathan,

01:25:48.727 --> 01:25:52.376
she's not what she will seem.

01:26:08.538 --> 01:26:10.355
Jonathan.

01:26:10.457 --> 01:26:12.479
What happened to your face?

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:18.069
You're frightened of
me, too, aren't you?

01:26:18.757 --> 01:26:21.155
Oh, I can't bear it.

01:26:21.385 --> 01:26:25.865
I don't understand. I don't understand.
What's happening to me?

01:26:33.105 --> 01:26:36.003
You seem yourself again.

01:26:36.775 --> 01:26:39.568
I've never felt so weak.

01:26:39.569 --> 01:26:43.719
Weak? You have the
strength of 10 men.

01:26:45.742 --> 01:26:48.720
Jonathan, can you still love me?

01:26:49.788 --> 01:26:51.685
I worship you.

01:26:56.294 --> 01:26:58.771
I worship you.

01:27:03.844 --> 01:27:05.177
Will you tell me something?

01:27:05.178 --> 01:27:07.030
Of course.

01:27:08.014 --> 01:27:11.934
What were you doing, you and
my father and the professor,

01:27:11.935 --> 01:27:14.253
in the cemetery to Mina?

01:27:17.315 --> 01:27:19.650
I can't... I can't...

01:27:19.651 --> 01:27:21.986
You say you love me,
but you don't trust me.

01:27:21.987 --> 01:27:23.988
I would trust you with
my life, my soul.

01:27:23.989 --> 01:27:25.364
Then tell me, what were you doing?

01:27:25.365 --> 01:27:28.593
You and the professor at Carfax.

01:27:34.291 --> 01:27:38.669
I only want to know if
you can still love me.

01:27:38.670 --> 01:27:41.130
Oh, Lucy, please. Please.

01:27:41.131 --> 01:27:43.048
There's no need to
hide your schemes

01:27:43.049 --> 01:27:44.967
and your plots from me, is there?

01:27:44.968 --> 01:27:46.615
No.

01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:49.948
Jonathan, it's no use.

01:27:51.850 --> 01:27:55.019
Whatever he wants to
know, he finds out.

01:27:55.020 --> 01:27:57.396
He knows everything you
think, everything you do.

01:27:57.397 --> 01:27:59.795
Lucy, stop, please!

01:28:00.734 --> 01:28:04.008
- All right. All right.
- Stop it!

01:28:04.863 --> 01:28:06.697
- No.
- Don't worry.

01:28:06.698 --> 01:28:08.574
No. Lucy, please.

01:28:08.575 --> 01:28:11.974
There's nothing to be
frightened of, I love you.

01:28:12.204 --> 01:28:14.413
- I love you.
- No.

01:28:16.082 --> 01:28:21.212
I love you. I love you. I love you.

01:28:21.213 --> 01:28:23.690
- No, please.
- I love you.

01:28:58.750 --> 01:29:02.479
Professor! Professor!

01:29:08.635 --> 01:29:10.361
Oh, no.

01:29:10.762 --> 01:29:14.223
Oh, no. Oh, no.

01:29:21.565 --> 01:29:23.542
Oh, no.

01:29:56.141 --> 01:29:58.818
- She'll sleep now.
- But shouldn't we stay with her?

01:29:58.819 --> 01:30:00.978
It's all right. My people
will look after her.

01:30:00.979 --> 01:30:03.188
- You two, you need some rest.
- Give me them back!

01:30:03.189 --> 01:30:04.481
Give me them back!
Give me them back!

01:30:04.482 --> 01:30:06.984
- Give me them back, you old niggly.
- What?

01:30:06.985 --> 01:30:08.152
Dr. Seward, make him
give me them back.

01:30:08.153 --> 01:30:10.112
- He's collecting bugs.
- Bugs?

01:30:10.113 --> 01:30:12.114
And he's eating them alive.

01:30:12.115 --> 01:30:14.033
He's disgusting!

01:30:14.034 --> 01:30:15.200
You'll see what
disgusting is tonight...

01:30:15.201 --> 01:30:16.827
- Hey, get down there!
- ...when he comes.

01:30:16.828 --> 01:30:20.122
- Excuse me. When who comes, please?
- You know.

01:30:20.123 --> 01:30:22.666
Give me them back, you
crab-faced old buzzard.

01:30:22.667 --> 01:30:26.316
You've got no blood in you, anyway.

01:30:26.338 --> 01:30:28.839
And besides, I've got one
here that you didn't find.

01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:31.675
Right, in the straitjacket with him.
Get him in. Come on.

01:30:31.676 --> 01:30:34.053
Do you think Dracula
will come back tonight?

01:30:34.054 --> 01:30:35.554
Of course he will.

01:30:35.555 --> 01:30:39.955
Well, we must obviously be ready.

01:31:29.109 --> 01:31:31.006
Good evening.

01:31:46.543 --> 01:31:49.378
They shouldn't have
tied me up like this.

01:31:49.379 --> 01:31:53.074
I would have gone
quiet, like a kitten.

01:31:53.925 --> 01:31:56.072
I'd like a kitten.

01:31:56.094 --> 01:31:59.413
A nice, little,
sleek, playful kitten

01:31:59.931 --> 01:32:02.204
that I could feed you to.

01:32:07.230 --> 01:32:10.709
I'd play with him,
and I'd stroke him,

01:32:10.775 --> 01:32:13.736
and I'd feed him and
feed him and feed him...

01:32:27.375 --> 01:32:31.378
Swales! Mr. Swales! Mr. Swales!

01:32:31.379 --> 01:32:34.882
He's coming to get me. He's climbing
straight up the wall to get me.

01:32:34.883 --> 01:32:37.634
I'm dying, and he's
laughing with his red mouth

01:32:37.635 --> 01:32:40.471
and those sharp white
teeth of his like rats.

01:32:40.472 --> 01:32:44.576
Hundreds and thousands
and millions of them.

01:32:55.820 --> 01:32:59.344
Oh, God, help my poor soul.

01:33:04.245 --> 01:33:05.829
Renfield.

01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:09.354
I'm the slave. I'm the dog, master.

01:33:09.417 --> 01:33:11.585
But please don't kill me.

01:33:11.586 --> 01:33:14.088
For the love of God, let me live.

01:33:14.089 --> 01:33:16.441
Did I not promise you

01:33:16.883 --> 01:33:20.111
that you should come
to me at your death

01:33:20.345 --> 01:33:24.348
and enjoy centuries
of life and power

01:33:24.349 --> 01:33:26.683
over the bodies and
souls of others?

01:33:26.684 --> 01:33:28.560
But I don't want human life.

01:33:32.774 --> 01:33:36.860
You betrayed me. You sought
to warn them all against me.

01:33:36.861 --> 01:33:39.363
Then punish me.
Torture me, I deserve it.

01:33:39.364 --> 01:33:40.989
But please, let me live.

01:33:40.990 --> 01:33:43.308
Oh, Renfield.

01:33:44.577 --> 01:33:46.975
You disappoint me so.

01:34:23.741 --> 01:34:26.514
Oh, Miss Lucy! Miss Lucy!

01:34:27.328 --> 01:34:29.180
Dracula?

01:34:29.581 --> 01:34:31.353
Quick!

01:34:32.917 --> 01:34:36.521
Miss Seward, sir! I don't
have the key! The key!

01:34:38.756 --> 01:34:41.358
Hurry, Doctor. Come on!

01:34:47.182 --> 01:34:48.390
Quickly!

01:34:48.391 --> 01:34:50.038
Lucy!

01:34:52.270 --> 01:34:53.770
Lucy!

01:34:53.771 --> 01:34:55.543
Lucy!

01:34:58.109 --> 01:35:00.527
No! Come on!

01:35:00.528 --> 01:35:04.803
Where is he taking her, Abraham?
Where is he taking her?

01:35:22.342 --> 01:35:25.946
Go left, down the lane
here. Down the lane.

01:35:38.316 --> 01:35:40.817
Faster! Won't this
contraption go faster?

01:35:40.818 --> 01:35:43.796
It won't go any bloody faster.

01:35:56.751 --> 01:35:59.604
The forest! Try the forest.

01:36:16.396 --> 01:36:18.213
Lucy, come.

01:36:18.356 --> 01:36:20.299
Come to me.

01:36:24.279 --> 01:36:29.476
No, you must go on a bit longer
as a creature of the sun.

01:36:30.076 --> 01:36:34.021
Only until we have left behind
those who would destroy us.

01:36:34.289 --> 01:36:36.015
And then?

01:36:37.208 --> 01:36:40.687
And then you will join
me on a higher plane,

01:36:40.753 --> 01:36:42.730
feeding on them.

01:36:43.214 --> 01:36:46.192
We will create more
of our kind, Lucy.

01:36:54.892 --> 01:36:56.018
Which way?

01:36:56.019 --> 01:36:58.895
I know that way lies
Scarborough, but I don't know.

01:36:58.896 --> 01:37:00.731
Listen Listen!

01:37:00.732 --> 01:37:05.007
Hey! Hey! Hey, there, driver!

01:37:05.945 --> 01:37:07.487
Tom Hindley, is that you?

01:37:07.488 --> 01:37:08.989
Yes, sir. It's me. Morning.

01:37:08.990 --> 01:37:10.574
What are you doing out
here at this hour?

01:37:10.575 --> 01:37:12.784
I had to pick up another
of them damn crates

01:37:12.785 --> 01:37:15.287
and take to the docks at
Scarborough, before I could get...

01:37:15.288 --> 01:37:16.621
Whoa!

01:37:16.622 --> 01:37:18.081
Whoa!

01:37:19.751 --> 01:37:22.604
Look, that crate!

01:37:23.129 --> 01:37:24.921
Scarborough. The port!

01:37:24.922 --> 01:37:27.799
- Then he's leaving England.
- After him!

01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:29.492
Hurry.

01:38:02.377 --> 01:38:03.668
Hindley!

01:38:03.669 --> 01:38:07.631
- Pull in front of him.
- For God's sake, stop, man!

01:38:07.632 --> 01:38:09.174
Hindley!

01:38:09.175 --> 01:38:11.051
I can't stop them!

01:38:11.052 --> 01:38:12.969
For God's sake, what
are you doing, man?

01:38:12.970 --> 01:38:14.992
I'm doing me best, aren't I?

01:38:16.474 --> 01:38:17.808
Pull over, man! Pull over.

01:38:17.809 --> 01:38:19.581
Hindley!

01:38:31.906 --> 01:38:33.678
Whoa!

01:38:37.745 --> 01:38:39.996
You stupid ha'porth!

01:38:39.997 --> 01:38:41.665
Maniac!

01:38:50.049 --> 01:38:52.947
Come! Come on!

01:38:56.389 --> 01:39:00.183
Whoa, Billy! Hey! Ho!
Whoa, Billy! Hey!

01:39:00.184 --> 01:39:01.852
Hindley!

01:39:01.853 --> 01:39:04.354
Come on! Whoa! Hey, Billy.

01:39:04.355 --> 01:39:06.332
Hindley!

01:39:17.869 --> 01:39:19.891
Look out!

01:39:37.555 --> 01:39:40.348
This thing mocks us, Abraham.

01:39:40.349 --> 01:39:43.477
If we are beaten,
then there is no God.

01:39:43.478 --> 01:39:45.729
The axle's cracked.

01:39:45.730 --> 01:39:47.272
Scarborough, how far is it yet?

01:39:47.273 --> 01:39:49.441
It's 10 miles. It's no use.

01:39:49.442 --> 01:39:51.635
Come on, we must try.

01:39:59.243 --> 01:40:00.911
Fresh mackerel! Really fresh!

01:40:00.912 --> 01:40:02.662
Eels, all fresh today!

01:40:05.166 --> 01:40:08.610
Get your fresh mackerel,
two bob a box.

01:40:10.129 --> 01:40:12.151
Where is it?

01:40:12.965 --> 01:40:16.676
You, sir. This wagon.
You did see it arrive?

01:40:16.677 --> 01:40:18.345
Is that the one with
the big crate on it?

01:40:18.346 --> 01:40:20.430
Yes, where is it?

01:40:20.431 --> 01:40:22.699
It's out there, aboard
the <i>Czarina Catherine</i>,

01:40:22.700 --> 01:40:24.684
- bound for Rumania.
- Take us to her. We'll pay you.

01:40:24.685 --> 01:40:26.520
Please, we must catch that ship.

01:40:26.521 --> 01:40:27.155
What?

01:40:27.156 --> 01:40:30.857
You stay here in case they are
not on board. Keep well. Bye.

01:40:30.858 --> 01:40:32.630
Take care.

01:40:49.544 --> 01:40:52.772
- Hey! Stop!
- Hey! Hey!

01:41:09.981 --> 01:41:11.356
Dracula, where is he?

01:41:11.857 --> 01:41:14.901
Count Dracula is on this ship!

01:41:19.073 --> 01:41:21.141
<i>Nosferatu.</i>

01:41:25.121 --> 01:41:27.098
The cargo hold!

01:41:32.336 --> 01:41:34.313
Where is it?

01:41:35.298 --> 01:41:37.195
Come on!

01:41:44.098 --> 01:41:45.307
Jonathan, here.

01:41:45.308 --> 01:41:47.000
I see it.

01:42:24.263 --> 01:42:26.331
No!
