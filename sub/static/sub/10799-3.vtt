WEBVTT

00:03.730 --> 00:07.130
Captain's log, stardate 43152.4.

00:07.300 --> 00:11.940
We are entering the Delta Rana
star system, after a distress call

00:12.110 --> 00:15.610
from the Federation colony
on its fourth planet.

00:15.780 --> 00:21.120
The transmission reported an attack
by an unidentified spacecraft.

00:21.250 --> 00:24.190
Our mission is one of rescue
and, if necessary,

00:24.350 --> 00:27.290
confrontation with a hostile force.

00:28.360 --> 00:32.159
- Shields up, maximum strength.
- Shields up.

00:32.330 --> 00:37.600
Sensors do not indicate the presence
of any armed space vehicles.

00:37.770 --> 00:39.670
They could be cloaked.

00:39.830 --> 00:43.840
Mr Crusher, keep us clear
of the planet's three moons.

00:44.010 --> 00:45.710
- Aye, sir.
- Captain,

00:45.870 --> 00:48.210
we have lost Rana IV's call sign.

00:48.380 --> 00:52.380
Open a frequency
to Colony Operations.

00:52.550 --> 00:56.220
No response.
Rana IV is emissions-quiet.

00:56.380 --> 01:00.320
There are 1 1,000 inhabitants
in this colony.

01:00.490 --> 01:04.360
At this range,
I should sense something. I don't.

01:05.790 --> 01:08.730
Mr Data,
put the planet on the main viewer.

01:10.400 --> 01:12.030
Magnify.

01:15.470 --> 01:17.740
My God!

01:19.470 --> 01:24.310
Helm, put us in a high equatorial
orbit. Scan for survivors.

01:25.750 --> 01:28.480
Scanning 90 degrees of longitude
as we orbit.

01:28.650 --> 01:32.590
No sign of water, vegetation,
artificial structures.

01:32.750 --> 01:35.160
Life-form readings are negative.

01:35.320 --> 01:38.260
- Could the colonists have escaped?
- Unlikely.

01:38.430 --> 01:41.230
Rana IV
had no interstellar spacecraft.

01:42.530 --> 01:45.200
Who would cause such devastation?

01:45.330 --> 01:49.940
Hold it...
Captain, I've got something here.

01:50.100 --> 01:56.380
37 degrees north and 62 degrees east.
It's a structure.

01:57.350 --> 02:01.020
- Life?
- Two life forms, possibly human.

02:01.180 --> 02:03.950
Put it on the main viewer. Magnify.

02:06.190 --> 02:11.230
The structure is located
at the centre of the vegetation, sir.

02:11.390 --> 02:16.760
An entire planet obliterated, but for
a few acres of trees and a building.

02:16.830 --> 02:21.500
- Must be an illusion.
- Negative. It is as you see it.

02:21.670 --> 02:23.570
Number One.

02:23.670 --> 02:26.970
I think you'd better see
who's at home.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:57.170 --> 03:00.370
Space, the final frontier.

03:01.310 --> 03:05.310
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

03:05.480 --> 03:11.090
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds...

03:11.250 --> 03:14.360
...to seek out new life
and new civilisations...

03:16.090 --> 03:19.160
...to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

04:30.160 --> 04:34.470
As survivors of a nuclear holocaust,
they can't be in good shape.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.600
I understand. Counselor?

04:37.100 --> 04:39.440
What I sense of them is human.

04:39.610 --> 04:43.040
- And something else?
- It's difficult to explain.

04:43.210 --> 04:47.550
I feel... there is something
different about these two people.

04:49.650 --> 04:51.950
Sorry,
I can't be clearer than that.

04:54.390 --> 04:57.120
- We're ready.
- Good luck, Number One.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.700
Energize.

05:32.830 --> 05:34.560
Geordi, what can you tell me?

05:36.760 --> 05:40.170
The house is a typical settlement
structure with adaptations.

05:40.270 --> 05:43.500
Thermal properties all seem
to conform to known materials.

05:43.670 --> 05:46.170
If there are any indicators
why this area

05:46.340 --> 05:48.880
has remained intact,
I cannot detect them.

05:49.540 --> 05:51.550
Worf, the interior of the house?

05:51.710 --> 05:56.280
There is one individual at the south
end, the other toward the north.

05:56.950 --> 05:58.590
There is a weapon.

05:58.750 --> 06:03.260
A low-yield phaser, non-functional,
near the front-room individual.

06:04.430 --> 06:06.460
So a frontal assault is unwarranted.

06:06.630 --> 06:10.260
Stay here. I'll try
an old-fashioned knock at the door.

06:11.100 --> 06:13.800
Wait! There's something concealed...

06:20.910 --> 06:25.250
What are you doing? This is
private property. Who are you?

06:25.410 --> 06:28.250
I'm Cmdr William Riker,
of the USS Enterprise.

06:28.420 --> 06:31.450
Crew members.
May I come down and approach?

06:31.620 --> 06:33.450
You leave him where he is.

06:33.960 --> 06:36.290
- Should I incapacitate him?
- No.

06:37.120 --> 06:38.630
We're a rescue party.

06:38.790 --> 06:43.060
We picked up your distress call
and came as fast as we could.

06:43.230 --> 06:46.570
Kevin! Kevin, what are you doing?

06:46.730 --> 06:49.400
Can't you see they're here to help?
They're human!

06:49.540 --> 06:52.470
Go back in the house.
This could be a trick.

06:53.240 --> 06:57.350
We almost gave up. We were afraid
the Federation had been attacked.

06:57.880 --> 07:00.720
What about the colony?
Do you know of others?

07:00.880 --> 07:03.680
It's been days
since we've seen or heard anybody.

07:06.750 --> 07:10.020
No, don't.
Don't tell me we're the only ones.

07:12.690 --> 07:15.930
Their spaceship was so big
you could see it in orbit.

07:16.100 --> 07:18.370
They took our world apart.

07:18.530 --> 07:19.770
Who?

07:20.400 --> 07:23.170
We don't know.
We never saw their faces.

07:23.340 --> 07:25.670
You don't know where they are now?

07:27.110 --> 07:29.040
I guess they've gone away.

07:30.180 --> 07:32.710
I'm sorry.
I'm only performing a physical.

07:33.180 --> 07:35.620
Could I have your names
for the record?

07:35.780 --> 07:39.090
I'm Rishon Uxbridge.
This is my husband Kevin.

07:39.250 --> 07:44.290
Botanists from the aquatic city
New Martim Vaz, in Earth's Atlantic.

07:44.890 --> 07:47.560
Residents of Rana IV
for five years.

07:47.730 --> 07:51.900
You, madam, are 82 and a composer
of Tao classical music.

07:52.600 --> 07:56.240
You, sir, are 85, a specialist
in symbiotic plant life.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.270
You have been married 53 years.

07:59.270 --> 08:01.710
I memorized the colony register
on the way

08:01.880 --> 08:04.150
in the event
that information was needed.

08:09.480 --> 08:11.590
Is something wrong?

08:11.750 --> 08:14.620
With your permission,
I'd like to look inside.

08:14.790 --> 08:17.560
Why?
What could interest you in there?

08:18.460 --> 08:20.800
Mr Uxbridge, as far as we know,

08:20.960 --> 08:25.330
you, your wife and this house
are all that survived that attack.

08:25.970 --> 08:29.140
That's either a bizarre coincidence
or by design.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.240
I don't favor coincidence.

08:31.410 --> 08:34.440
Are you saying that we were
kept alive intentionally?

08:35.780 --> 08:37.080
Yes.

08:37.250 --> 08:40.850
I don't understand. You don't think
Rishon and I did something...

08:41.020 --> 08:44.990
...to merit survival?
I mean, betrayed the others?

08:45.150 --> 08:48.120
I'm not accusing you of anything,
Mr Uxbridge.

08:48.290 --> 08:52.460
The attacking force spared you.
We'd like to know why.

08:52.630 --> 08:54.300
Now, may I go inside?

09:04.370 --> 09:07.210
I'll make everyone
a nice cup of tea.

09:07.380 --> 09:10.950
We have lovely tea here on Rana.
It grows wild almost every...

09:12.910 --> 09:14.250
Sir.

09:16.080 --> 09:20.690
May I say your attempt to hold us
at bay with a non-functioning weapon

09:20.860 --> 09:23.390
was an act of unmitigated gall.

09:24.190 --> 09:25.960
Didn't fool you, huh?

09:27.300 --> 09:28.930
I admire gall.

09:31.470 --> 09:33.400
Go ahead, pick it up.

09:35.200 --> 09:39.370
It's a music box. It's been
in my family for generations.

10:06.830 --> 10:08.740
Nothing unusual
about this house.

10:08.900 --> 10:11.770
Except the fact it's here.
What about them?

10:11.940 --> 10:15.640
In reasonable health, but showing
signs of stress. Understandable,

10:15.810 --> 10:19.810
- After what they've been through.
- Somehow, they're different.

10:19.980 --> 10:22.750
Let's get back to the ship.
We'll take them.

10:22.920 --> 10:25.750
Excuse me.
We have to return to our ship.

10:25.920 --> 10:27.620
I haven't finished fixing tea.

10:27.790 --> 10:31.490
I'm sorry. I can allow time
for you and Kevin to pack.

10:31.660 --> 10:35.800
- What do you mean?
- You're not thinking of taking us?

10:36.500 --> 10:39.700
Surely you can't remain here.
How can you care for yourselves?

10:40.130 --> 10:42.200
Kevin, I can't leave my home.

10:42.370 --> 10:48.380
- No one's going to make us.
- You could be in danger on Rana.

10:49.340 --> 10:53.680
Commander, we appreciate your concern
but we're not going.

10:53.850 --> 10:57.050
- We'll manage. We always have.
- Alright.

10:57.220 --> 10:59.550
I can't make you come with us.

11:00.490 --> 11:03.160
Are you familiar with one of these?

11:03.320 --> 11:07.860
We'll be in the system for several
days. If you reconsider, contact us.

11:08.030 --> 11:10.930
We'll be fine, Commander.
We have each other.

11:22.780 --> 11:24.350
Are they collaborators?

11:24.510 --> 11:28.380
Did they provide the colony's
assailants with something

11:28.550 --> 11:30.720
that abetted the destruction
of Rana IV

11:30.890 --> 11:33.350
in order to protect their own lives?

11:33.520 --> 11:37.730
What did two botanists in their 80s
possess that could aid the attackers?

11:37.890 --> 11:40.060
We don't know
what their enemy needed.

11:40.460 --> 11:44.570
- Love? Fear? Hope?
- Maybe they're being held hostage...

11:44.730 --> 11:49.200
No, nothing in my readings
indicated that level of stress.

11:49.370 --> 11:51.270
Counselor?

11:52.440 --> 11:53.770
Counselor Troi?

11:55.910 --> 11:59.250
I'm sorry...
I don't sense them well enough.

12:01.580 --> 12:06.090
Number One, you say the couple is
incapable of sustaining themselves?

12:06.250 --> 12:09.690
There's a fusion reactor
in the house, good for five years.

12:09.860 --> 12:14.160
But their water-table is tainted.
They have nothing except a garden.

12:15.360 --> 12:18.930
- They won't come to the ship?
- They were adamant.

12:19.100 --> 12:22.170
We'll do what we can for them.
In the meantime...

12:24.940 --> 12:28.510
I'm sorry, I'm not well.
I'd like to go to my quarters.

12:29.180 --> 12:31.780
- By all means.
- Anything I can do?

12:39.950 --> 12:43.490
Captain, a search of
the Ranian System has determined

12:43.660 --> 12:47.300
that the force that attacked
this planet is no longer present.

12:48.960 --> 12:51.830
I remember a Starfleet admiral
saying the same thing

12:52.000 --> 12:54.840
about renegade Andorians
in the Triangular System.

12:55.000 --> 12:59.740
It turns out that they had
dismantled their ship and hidden it.

12:59.910 --> 13:04.010
Those Andorians did not
have to contend with my thoroughness.

13:04.180 --> 13:06.250
I will stake my reputation.

13:20.830 --> 13:22.630
Don't... listen.

13:29.300 --> 13:31.410
Think of something else.

13:40.720 --> 13:43.780
Stop! Please stop!

13:50.790 --> 13:52.160
Yes?

13:58.970 --> 14:02.670
I was concerned.
I came to see if I could help.

14:04.140 --> 14:08.410
I'm fine, there's nothing wrong.
I'm just tired, that's all.

14:09.810 --> 14:12.580
Now, I may not have your gifts
at reading emotions

14:12.750 --> 14:16.680
but I can tell when someone
is in pain... and hiding it.

14:17.790 --> 14:19.290
It's so silly.

14:20.490 --> 14:21.990
I hear music...

14:22.690 --> 14:25.530
...in my mind, music that won't stop.

14:26.860 --> 14:29.030
Perhaps it's a symptom of fatigue.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.500
We've all been inflicted at one time

14:31.670 --> 14:33.670
with that melody that won't go away.

14:33.840 --> 14:36.800
No, it's deeper than that.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.540
The song doesn't stop for an instant.

14:40.710 --> 14:44.180
It plays in perfect clarity,
from beginning to end,

14:44.350 --> 14:46.110
over and over again.

14:46.280 --> 14:49.950
I don't even know the song.
I never heard it before.

14:50.120 --> 14:51.720
When did this start?

14:51.890 --> 14:56.320
A few hours ago, while
the away team was on the surface.

14:56.490 --> 14:58.260
I was trying to...

14:59.660 --> 15:04.670
- I was thinking of Rishon and Kevin.
- Rishon and Kevin? And?

15:04.830 --> 15:06.770
I can't explain it, Captain.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.270
They're... elusive.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.270
They're...

15:15.610 --> 15:17.250
I'm sorry.

15:22.020 --> 15:24.250
Well, try and rest.

15:24.420 --> 15:27.220
Take the necessary sleep inducements
if you have to.

15:31.690 --> 15:34.560
Data, give us a visual.
Magnification factor 50.

15:38.500 --> 15:40.100
Look at the size of that!

15:45.340 --> 15:48.910
- Where did that come from?
- A Lagrange point,

15:49.080 --> 15:51.250
behind Rana IV's furthest moon.

15:53.350 --> 15:56.480
Our vehicle-classification index
can put no identity to it.

15:56.650 --> 15:59.450
- Its design is foreign.
- That's our boy.

15:59.620 --> 16:04.630
Five times our mass, carrying enough
armament to pulverize a planet.

16:04.790 --> 16:05.960
Lieutenant?

16:08.100 --> 16:12.470
I... cannot explain this, Captain.

16:12.630 --> 16:16.670
- It's heading for the planet.
- Hailing frequencies.

16:16.840 --> 16:19.670
Mr Data, ask them
to identify themselves

16:19.840 --> 16:21.510
and match our orbit.

16:23.110 --> 16:26.050
They've received the message
but are ignoring it.

16:26.210 --> 16:28.980
- Maximum shields, ready weapons.
- Aye, sir.

16:31.850 --> 16:35.060
It's assuming an attack posture.
Don't be surprised if...

16:36.560 --> 16:39.890
The vessel is firing streams
of positrons and antiprotons.

16:40.060 --> 16:44.170
Equivalent firepower, 40 megawatts.
Shields are holding.

16:47.400 --> 16:49.870
Again, 40 megawatts. No damage.

16:50.470 --> 16:53.570
If that's their best,
this should last five minutes.

16:53.740 --> 16:57.580
Let's raise our voice a little.
Fire phasers, a warning shot.

16:57.750 --> 17:00.880
Mr Data, invite them to stand to.

17:08.220 --> 17:11.390
The vessel has assumed a position
outside the Rana system

17:11.560 --> 17:13.660
and it is
rapidly increasing velocity.

17:13.829 --> 17:15.500
Helm, initiate pursuit.

17:16.700 --> 17:18.270
Aye, sir.

17:25.710 --> 17:29.540
The vessel has reached warp two
and continues an acceleration curve.

17:29.710 --> 17:33.410
- We're not getting any closer.
- Give us a superior curve.

17:33.580 --> 17:36.250
Warp three, warp four.

17:36.420 --> 17:40.190
The warship continues to match our
acceleration curve point for point.

17:40.350 --> 17:41.620
Warp 4.5.

17:41.790 --> 17:43.090
Warp five.

17:43.260 --> 17:44.730
Warp 5.5.

17:45.890 --> 17:49.260
Riker to La Forge.
Give us everything you can.

17:49.430 --> 17:53.270
Yes, sir! I'll get you
to 9.37 in 1 5 seconds.

17:57.870 --> 18:00.840
Warp 8.75. Warp nine.

18:01.540 --> 18:04.280
It's matching our acceleration
perfectly.

18:05.310 --> 18:09.380
Number One, I have the impression
that we're being toyed with.

18:10.990 --> 18:13.650
- Take us back to Rana IV.
- Back?

18:13.820 --> 18:17.460
We have unfinished business.
I need to talk to those people.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.190
You have the bridge.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.900
Reduce speed.
Bring us around on a return course.

18:27.900 --> 18:29.500
This one's getting away.

18:41.420 --> 18:44.390
Good afternoon!
I'm sorry if I startled you.

18:44.550 --> 18:46.890
Jean-Luc Picard,
Captain of the Enterprise.

18:47.490 --> 18:50.320
I have brought you something
you will need...

18:51.160 --> 18:53.830
...if you're going to stay on Rana IV.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.430
A matter replicator.

18:55.600 --> 19:00.070
- It has limited capabilities.
- We have no use for such a thing.

19:00.230 --> 19:02.940
It will provide you with clothing,
food and water.

19:03.100 --> 19:05.940
Lt Worf will demonstrate
its operation.

19:06.110 --> 19:08.910
- We don't need it.
- Kevin, we do.

19:09.080 --> 19:10.440
Thank you, Captain.

19:10.610 --> 19:14.450
Kevin and I were about to have tea.
You must join us.

19:14.620 --> 19:16.180
I'd like that.

19:16.350 --> 19:19.420
Rishon, they only want to spy on us.

19:19.590 --> 19:24.560
Kevin, I've never turned anyone
away from here. I won't start now.

19:24.730 --> 19:26.760
- Captain.
- Thank you.

19:31.430 --> 19:32.800
No! Stop!

19:34.940 --> 19:38.710
Please, I'll do anything!
Please stop!

19:43.240 --> 19:46.650
Please. I'm here to help.

19:46.810 --> 19:49.880
It's so loud! It's getting louder!

19:50.050 --> 19:53.220
Please, I can't stand it!
Make it stop!

19:53.390 --> 19:54.920
Move her to the bed.

20:04.200 --> 20:06.030
This will help you relax.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.110
I hear it.

20:12.270 --> 20:15.210
It's still there! It's so loud!

20:16.140 --> 20:20.550
- Take her to sickbay.
- No, I want to stay in my quarters.

20:20.720 --> 20:24.820
- I can get you to sleep.
- The music will follow me.

20:24.990 --> 20:28.720
I can induce delta sleep,
lock out even your deepest dreams.

20:28.890 --> 20:32.030
It's not a dream. It's real.

20:34.360 --> 20:37.470
Kevin and I first met
on a ship at sea.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.370
He was a starving student

20:39.530 --> 20:43.700
with this threadbare suit
and mismatched shoes.

20:43.840 --> 20:48.710
I was traveling with my parents
who did not like him hanging around.

20:49.780 --> 20:55.120
Two hours later, I asked him
to marry me. He knew I was serious.

20:55.280 --> 20:58.290
I don't think
he's ever recovered from that day.

21:02.620 --> 21:04.190
What do you think, Mr Worf?

21:06.460 --> 21:08.130
Good tea.

21:10.130 --> 21:11.430
Nice house.

21:13.300 --> 21:17.100
Why did you leave Earth
and come here when you did?

21:18.940 --> 21:20.810
You mean at our age.

21:23.110 --> 21:27.080
We thought it might make us
fall in love all over again.

21:27.250 --> 21:28.580
It worked.

21:28.720 --> 21:32.250
Must've been terrible when
the colony was fighting for its life.

21:32.420 --> 21:33.820
It was.

21:33.990 --> 21:36.490
Fires lit the sky.

21:36.660 --> 21:41.260
There was unbelievable thunder.
The ground never stopped shaking.

21:41.430 --> 21:42.830
And yet...

21:43.300 --> 21:44.770
...you survived.

21:47.100 --> 21:50.570
We don't know why we survived
and the others didn't.

21:50.740 --> 21:54.240
I've tried to put some purpose to it
but I can't.

21:54.410 --> 21:57.580
I've been wondering
when your ship would be leaving?

21:58.580 --> 22:00.920
I don't have an answer for that.

22:02.420 --> 22:05.820
A few hours ago,
we encountered a warship,

22:05.950 --> 22:08.190
possibly the one that attacked you.

22:08.790 --> 22:11.330
We forced it to leave the system...

22:11.960 --> 22:17.000
...but we were not able to affect it
otherwise. It could return.

22:17.170 --> 22:19.500
Kevin, you said it had gone away.

22:21.540 --> 22:23.300
I guess I was wrong.

22:24.670 --> 22:27.410
Don't worry, it didn't hurt us.
It won't now.

22:27.980 --> 22:29.840
Do you know that?

22:29.980 --> 22:33.650
No, but I don't enjoy
seeing my wife frightened.

22:34.920 --> 22:38.820
We've told you,
we don't know why we were spared.

22:38.990 --> 22:41.320
But there had to be some reason.

22:41.990 --> 22:45.330
In some way, you were different
from the other colonists.

22:45.490 --> 22:48.660
Your geographical location,
your philosophical beliefs.

22:50.330 --> 22:52.170
The color of your eyes.

22:53.200 --> 22:55.570
In some way, you were set apart.

22:55.740 --> 22:57.440
There was a difference.

22:59.510 --> 23:01.840
I'm a man of special conscience.

23:02.010 --> 23:05.210
While the others did what they could,
I chose not to fight.

23:06.380 --> 23:07.880
That is your protected right.

23:08.050 --> 23:11.220
But the attacking ship
had no way of realizing this.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.860
I expected to die like the others.

23:19.290 --> 23:23.260
There is no reason for you
and your ship to remain.

23:24.200 --> 23:26.300
We can manage without you.

23:28.470 --> 23:31.710
Kevin grieved for the others,
Captain, but he did nothing.

23:31.870 --> 23:36.740
He is a very gentle man.
You must understand that.

23:36.910 --> 23:40.550
What about you, Rishon?
Is that how you feel?

23:42.650 --> 23:45.950
I wanted to fight
but I stayed with my husband.

23:48.320 --> 23:51.690
Well, Captain. Thank you again
for the replicator.

23:52.260 --> 23:54.030
I'd better clean up now.

23:59.170 --> 24:03.170
Before we leave, I ask you
one more time. Come to the ship.

24:03.340 --> 24:04.810
For your safety.

24:06.670 --> 24:08.780
Captain, I am frightened but...

24:09.880 --> 24:13.280
I can't leave Rana,
even if it means my life.

24:19.520 --> 24:23.720
I don't understand. I've inhibited
almost all activity in the neocortex.

24:23.890 --> 24:26.960
She continues
as if she is hearing the music.

24:28.160 --> 24:31.900
We have to shield her from all
outside stimuli by inducing coma.

24:33.940 --> 24:38.040
I have a positive identification.
It is the vessel that attacked us.

24:38.210 --> 24:42.240
It is re-entering the system at
high velocity, approaching Rana IV.

24:42.410 --> 24:44.550
Give us a tight visual, Data.

24:47.050 --> 24:50.280
Is it my imagination
or does it look a lot meaner?

24:50.450 --> 24:52.420
Shields up. Weapons ready.

24:54.190 --> 24:55.890
Our friend is back.

24:56.390 --> 24:59.960
I'm not surprised.
Mr Worf, open a hailing frequency.

25:01.060 --> 25:03.060
Warn the vessel to stay clear.

25:03.230 --> 25:06.630
Aye, sir, but they are
already within firing range.

25:11.710 --> 25:13.570
Shields are down.

25:13.740 --> 25:16.780
They hit us with 400 gigawatts
of particle energy!

25:17.110 --> 25:18.750
- Damage?
- Superficial.

25:18.910 --> 25:21.050
But how to reassemble the shields?

25:23.450 --> 25:26.150
Shields down.
Thermal damage to the hull.

25:26.650 --> 25:30.220
The warship is capable
of far more powerful bursts.

25:30.390 --> 25:32.660
They are maneuvering
between us and Rana IV.

25:32.830 --> 25:36.400
Number One, we have been exemplary
in our patience.

25:36.560 --> 25:40.500
Lt Worf, fire phasers with
a simultaneous spread of torpedoes.

25:46.840 --> 25:48.480
The vessel appears undamaged.

25:48.940 --> 25:52.650
Its defenses are able to absorb
incoming matter and energy.

25:52.810 --> 25:55.350
Commence rapid fire.
All weapons on full.

26:03.820 --> 26:06.190
Shields down. Internal damage.

26:06.790 --> 26:08.760
Weapons-systems control lost.

26:08.930 --> 26:11.100
Riker to sickbay. Medical assistance.

26:11.270 --> 26:12.630
On our way.

26:12.800 --> 26:16.670
Mr Crusher, move the Enterprise
out of range of the vessel.

26:16.840 --> 26:18.370
Aye, sir.

26:33.860 --> 26:35.460
Mr Worf?

26:35.620 --> 26:38.330
The vessel
has terminated its pursuit.

26:38.490 --> 26:41.360
It is assuming an orbit
around Rana IV.

26:42.560 --> 26:44.600
Kevin and Rishon?

26:44.770 --> 26:46.570
We can't help them.

26:47.700 --> 26:50.370
But it's my guess
they're in no danger.

27:04.820 --> 27:06.320
Can you help her?

27:06.820 --> 27:08.660
I've done everything I can.

27:08.820 --> 27:12.790
I don't understand the nature
of this music or where it's from.

27:12.960 --> 27:15.330
- Could it be telepathic?
- Yes.

27:15.500 --> 27:18.230
But I'm not the expert
in determining that.

27:19.400 --> 27:21.640
They're blocking her sensitivity.

27:21.800 --> 27:24.910
They're stopping her
from seeing the truth.

27:25.070 --> 27:28.510
- Who's stopping her?
- Kevin and Rishon.

27:28.680 --> 27:30.440
What?

27:30.610 --> 27:32.450
They wanted us to leave.

27:32.610 --> 27:34.280
That's exactly what we're doing.

27:38.490 --> 27:40.960
- Picard to bridge.
- Yes, Captain?

27:41.120 --> 27:45.760
Number One, I want you to maintain
this course for another hour.

27:45.930 --> 27:49.260
Then turn the Enterprise around
back to Rana IV.

27:49.430 --> 27:51.630
We still won't have our shields
by then.

27:51.800 --> 27:53.940
Take it back, Number One.

27:54.100 --> 27:57.470
And this time,
nothing is going to lure us away.

28:03.340 --> 28:08.120
Sir, sensors indicate no spacecraft
near Rana IV, but, Captain...

28:08.280 --> 28:11.650
Forget your error.
There was no way to prevent it.

28:11.820 --> 28:14.890
Captain, the house
is coming into transporter range.

28:15.060 --> 28:18.560
Mr Worf, accompany me.
You have the bridge, Number One.

28:18.730 --> 28:22.660
Captain, that warship has come
after us twice. It could come back.

28:22.830 --> 28:25.700
I disagree.
I don't think it knows we're here.

28:25.870 --> 28:29.040
I think that it believes
it has run us off.

28:29.570 --> 28:33.070
However, that will all change
once I'm back on board.

28:33.240 --> 28:34.010
Sir?

28:34.640 --> 28:38.380
It's protecting Kevin and Rishon.
It responds to their wishes.

28:38.550 --> 28:43.420
Indirectly or directly, I'm not sure.
That's what I'm going to test.

29:07.910 --> 29:09.240
Celebrating?

29:12.050 --> 29:15.250
What are you doing here?
What do you want?

29:15.420 --> 29:18.320
This is your second show of surprise
at my appearance.

29:18.490 --> 29:21.220
The first time was understandable
but now?

29:21.390 --> 29:24.960
Unless it is because
you never expected to see me again.

29:25.390 --> 29:27.960
Why do you keep interfering
with our lives?

29:28.130 --> 29:30.900
It is not my intention to interfere.

29:31.070 --> 29:33.170
Only to help you and Rishon.

29:33.330 --> 29:36.440
Then, please, leave us alone.

29:36.600 --> 29:40.470
I promise. When I leave,
I will never set foot here again.

29:40.640 --> 29:43.210
The Enterprise will remain in orbit.

29:43.380 --> 29:45.880
- Why?
- To protect you.

29:46.050 --> 29:49.680
That's not necessary.
I thought you understood.

29:49.850 --> 29:53.120
It is necessary.
You're in grave danger.

29:53.290 --> 29:55.820
- A warship has returned.
- Kevin!

29:55.990 --> 29:59.990
- He's lying, Rishon.
- We fought a battle and lost.

30:00.160 --> 30:01.830
Many crew have been injured.

30:02.000 --> 30:06.230
A woman's mind is being destroyed
by telepathic manipulation.

30:06.400 --> 30:08.040
No. Please, no.

30:08.200 --> 30:10.870
This is a form of intimidation.

30:11.710 --> 30:13.310
I have my rights.

30:15.380 --> 30:19.310
Your rights. What about Rishon?

30:20.410 --> 30:22.720
Is she in favor of being left here?

30:24.420 --> 30:28.090
Come to the Enterprise,
where you will be safe.

30:29.160 --> 30:30.090
No.

30:32.190 --> 30:34.030
I can't leave Kevin.

30:34.900 --> 30:36.430
I'm staying.

30:37.170 --> 30:41.340
She's safe here with me...
in this house.

30:41.500 --> 30:44.570
Why are you safe?
Why is this house a sanctuary?

30:44.740 --> 30:47.510
Does it have to do
with refusing to fight?

30:49.780 --> 30:51.210
Tell me this.

30:52.010 --> 30:56.250
If Rishon were in danger,
would you kill to save her life?

30:58.020 --> 31:04.090
No, not for her. Not for anyone.
I will not kill.

31:04.260 --> 31:08.600
Please stop hurting him.
Captain, leave our house.

31:10.130 --> 31:12.430
It is my duty to protect you.

31:12.830 --> 31:16.640
The Enterprise will remain
in orbit around Rana IV

31:16.800 --> 31:19.840
as long as the two of you are alive.

31:30.280 --> 31:33.150
Number One, an update, please.

31:34.320 --> 31:37.490
Little change.
Our shields are still inoperable.

31:37.660 --> 31:40.930
We have partial control of weapons.
I doubled repair crews.

31:41.100 --> 31:45.970
The warship is approaching.
It is very close. 300,000km.

31:46.130 --> 31:47.770
How's that possible?

31:47.940 --> 31:49.600
That's no concern, Number One.

31:49.770 --> 31:52.110
It's here
and it's precisely on schedule.

31:52.270 --> 31:55.980
The vessel has altered its course
to intercept the Enterprise.

31:56.810 --> 31:59.550
Worf, arm phasers and torpedoes.
Prepare to fire.

31:59.710 --> 32:01.680
Belay those orders, Mr Worf.

32:04.990 --> 32:08.690
The vessel is now within 20,000km
of the Enterprise and closing.

32:08.860 --> 32:12.060
Let it come. Let it come.

32:14.160 --> 32:16.130
Activate the main viewer.

32:20.800 --> 32:24.970
- Evasive action, sir?
- The Enterprise will hold, Mr Worf.

32:25.140 --> 32:27.880
- Weapons, sir?
- On my orders, not before.

32:36.250 --> 32:39.690
The vessel is entering a low orbit
around Rana IV.

32:39.850 --> 32:43.460
It appears to be preparing to fire,
Captain.

32:44.190 --> 32:45.930
My calculations indicate

32:46.090 --> 32:49.130
that its target is the house
of Kevin and Rishon.

32:49.860 --> 32:52.530
There will be no interference
from us.

33:00.710 --> 33:02.480
The house has been obliterated.

33:04.610 --> 33:06.480
Scan for survivors.

33:08.580 --> 33:10.120
There are no survivors.

33:12.120 --> 33:13.590
Mr Worf.

33:14.720 --> 33:16.620
Prepare a photon torpedo.

33:16.790 --> 33:19.230
Fire at the enemy vessel when ready.

33:20.760 --> 33:22.200
Aye, sir.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.510
Number One.

33:31.670 --> 33:35.180
What reason does the Enterprise have
for remaining at Rana?

33:35.340 --> 33:37.450
The unknown vessel
has been destroyed.

33:37.610 --> 33:39.610
The Uxbridges have been destroyed.

33:39.780 --> 33:42.720
There is no reason
for the Enterprise to remain.

33:42.880 --> 33:43.850
Good.

33:44.020 --> 33:46.450
Helm, move us into higher orbit

33:46.620 --> 33:50.220
so we may keep the surface
of the planet under surveillance.

33:50.390 --> 33:54.030
Aye, sir. But, Captain,
what are we watching for?

33:54.200 --> 33:55.200
Anything.

33:55.360 --> 33:56.630
Everything.

33:56.800 --> 34:01.570
I'll be in my ready room if I'm
needed. That will be all for now.

34:22.690 --> 34:24.190
Come.

34:24.360 --> 34:26.360
May I speak with you, Captain?

34:26.530 --> 34:28.730
My pleasure, Number One.

34:28.900 --> 34:33.170
We have been observing this planet
for three hours. Nothing.

34:33.330 --> 34:36.040
I have the feeling
you're waiting for something.

34:40.610 --> 34:44.909
Your captain is acting
on an assumption, Will.

34:46.449 --> 34:49.420
And I'm not sure
what the result will be

34:49.580 --> 34:53.050
or... even
that my assumption is correct.

34:54.190 --> 34:59.730
We found two people alive in a house
on a devastated planet.

35:01.700 --> 35:02.860
But...

35:04.200 --> 35:09.300
...there was only one survivor
of the war on Rana IV.

35:12.040 --> 35:16.110
Why is it we maintain watch
on a planet that is dead?

35:20.480 --> 35:23.220
Bridge to Picard.
You'd better come see this.

35:27.460 --> 35:29.390
Captain. Commander.

35:29.560 --> 35:31.830
The house is back.
Trees, grass, everything.

35:31.990 --> 35:34.030
Happened right in front of us.

35:36.030 --> 35:38.530
Mr Worf, any survivors?

35:38.700 --> 35:42.240
I detect two life forms
inside the house.

35:42.400 --> 35:45.470
It appears
Kevin and Rishon were not destroyed.

35:45.640 --> 35:50.080
Helm, take us within transporter
range. We'll beam them up here.

35:50.240 --> 35:51.850
But will they not protest?

35:54.480 --> 35:55.850
Let them.

36:03.160 --> 36:05.730
Apologies if I interrupted a waltz.

36:06.360 --> 36:09.500
Why have you brought us here
against our will?

36:09.660 --> 36:12.730
I want to end the suffering
of my crew member.

36:12.870 --> 36:17.240
- I don't understand.
- Kevin does. He's the cause.

36:18.770 --> 36:22.940
At first I couldn't understand why
your house survived the holocaust.

36:23.110 --> 36:24.880
Then it occurred to me.

36:25.350 --> 36:27.110
It had been destroyed.

36:28.950 --> 36:32.950
That dwelling, where you served tea,
where you danced waltzes...

36:33.450 --> 36:34.960
...is a reproduction.

36:35.460 --> 36:37.120
Real to the touch,

36:37.290 --> 36:41.760
but capable of being created,
destroyed and created.

36:42.360 --> 36:45.600
- All on a whim.
- You're joking with us.

36:45.730 --> 36:49.040
- Can't you see this hurts him?
- Rishon.

36:49.870 --> 36:51.710
Hear what he has to say.

36:51.870 --> 36:55.080
More than anything, you wanted
the Enterprise away from Rana

36:55.240 --> 36:59.580
because the house, the plot of land,
your very existence,

36:59.750 --> 37:02.980
were incongruities that you were
not prepared to explain.

37:03.920 --> 37:08.390
The warship, another recreation,
tried to chase us away twice.

37:08.560 --> 37:09.760
And failed.

37:11.630 --> 37:13.930
But when I came the second time,

37:14.100 --> 37:16.560
I provided you
with the only condition

37:16.730 --> 37:20.070
that would make the Enterprise leave.
Your deaths.

37:20.840 --> 37:23.940
You did your best
to satisfy that condition.

37:25.240 --> 37:27.910
I'm deeply sorry about the woman.

37:29.180 --> 37:30.680
I will help her.

37:31.280 --> 37:34.780
But I must know
what you intend to do with me.

37:35.280 --> 37:39.320
You will be taken to a starbase
for the attack on the Enterprise

37:39.450 --> 37:42.620
and, possibly,
the deaths of 1 1,000 people.

37:42.790 --> 37:44.030
No!

37:44.160 --> 37:46.130
He never killed anyone.

37:46.260 --> 37:49.200
The destruction happened
just as I told you.

37:49.360 --> 37:51.470
But you haven't told us
the whole story.

37:52.300 --> 37:55.740
How it ended.
The part about... Rishon.

37:55.900 --> 37:57.570
What is he saying?

38:05.310 --> 38:06.850
Rishon...

38:07.010 --> 38:09.920
I can... touch you.

38:11.390 --> 38:13.920
I can hear your voice,
smell your perfume.

38:14.520 --> 38:18.590
In every respect, you are
a real person with your own mind...

38:19.330 --> 38:21.400
...and beliefs, but...

38:22.360 --> 38:24.330
...you do not exist.

38:24.500 --> 38:28.000
You died along with the others
defending the colony.

38:29.040 --> 38:33.170
He recreated you,
just as he recreated the house.

38:38.950 --> 38:43.120
You are the only living thing
that really exists on Rana.

38:43.280 --> 38:46.620
And though you look human,
you're not.

38:51.130 --> 38:52.560
He's in the turbolift.

38:52.730 --> 38:55.130
- Let him go.
- He is dangerous!

38:55.300 --> 38:59.500
So dangerous he could have destroyed
us had he wished. Track him.

38:59.670 --> 39:04.240
Alert the crew to keep clear. I want
him to understand we mean no harm.

39:04.410 --> 39:09.010
- Will he return to the planet?
- He is a creature of conscience.

39:09.140 --> 39:11.450
He has someone to help first.

39:19.790 --> 39:22.460
I've taken the music from her mind.

39:22.960 --> 39:24.490
She's alright now.

39:25.660 --> 39:27.200
She's sleeping.

39:31.830 --> 39:35.000
She was beginning to sense
who I really was.

39:35.670 --> 39:39.940
I've lived as a human for 50 years
but I couldn't hide from her.

39:40.110 --> 39:43.180
She's suffered
because of my pride and selfishness.

39:44.880 --> 39:47.010
It will not happen again.

39:47.520 --> 39:51.620
What happened on Rana IV?
The truth. This time, all of it.

39:59.390 --> 40:01.100
Very well.

40:04.230 --> 40:05.900
For what it's worth.

40:08.400 --> 40:10.200
I am a Douwd.

40:11.210 --> 40:14.580
An immortal being of disguises
and false surroundings.

40:16.080 --> 40:19.210
I have lived in this galaxy
for thousands of years,

40:19.380 --> 40:23.850
although until today,
no one has known my true identity.

40:24.420 --> 40:27.090
Once,
while traveling in human form,

40:27.220 --> 40:30.390
I chanced to fall in love
with an Earth woman.

40:31.560 --> 40:34.400
I put aside my powers
and became her husband.

40:35.260 --> 40:37.230
Our life was happy and rich.

40:38.730 --> 40:42.470
Eventually, we came to this planet
to live our final years.

40:44.640 --> 40:46.610
Now she is dead.

40:49.080 --> 40:51.750
She never knew what I really was.

40:53.920 --> 40:56.250
Your colony was attacked
by a warship.

40:56.420 --> 41:00.920
Belonging to the Husnock,
a species of hideous intelligence...

41:01.790 --> 41:04.590
...who knew only aggression
and destruction.

41:05.960 --> 41:11.470
I could've destroyed them with
a mere thought but I did not do so.

41:11.630 --> 41:15.270
You had the power to stop them
but you didn't?

41:16.270 --> 41:18.270
I refused to for the reason

41:18.440 --> 41:21.110
that I refused
to stop the Enterprise.

41:22.840 --> 41:26.080
I... will not kill.

41:27.010 --> 41:30.120
So you let the colonists
fight a hopeless battle?

41:31.590 --> 41:34.060
I tried to fool the Husnock...

41:35.490 --> 41:37.730
...as I tried to fool you.

41:37.860 --> 41:39.660
It only made them angrier.

41:41.330 --> 41:42.960
More cruel.

41:43.460 --> 41:47.540
And then
what you most feared happened.

41:47.700 --> 41:50.470
Rishon went to fight
with the colonists.

41:51.370 --> 41:52.970
And died with them.

41:55.710 --> 42:00.750
How I wish...
I could have died with her.

42:01.720 --> 42:05.920
But you couldn't.
You were left alone.

42:07.390 --> 42:08.360
Yes.

42:11.060 --> 42:13.030
I saw her broken body.

42:15.260 --> 42:16.930
I went insane.

42:18.230 --> 42:20.400
My hatred exploded.

42:21.140 --> 42:23.400
And in an instant of grief...

42:26.910 --> 42:29.140
...I destroyed the Husnock.

42:31.150 --> 42:34.320
Why did you try to hide this
from all of us?

42:34.480 --> 42:38.150
Was it guilt for not helping
Rishon and the others?

42:38.750 --> 42:43.660
No, no, no. You don't understand
the scope of my crime.

42:43.820 --> 42:48.230
I didn't kill just one Husnock,
or a hundred or a thousand...

42:50.730 --> 42:52.270
I killed them all.

42:56.340 --> 42:57.740
All Husnock.

42:58.640 --> 43:00.270
Everywhere.

43:08.450 --> 43:10.350
Are 1 1,000 people worth...

43:11.150 --> 43:12.690
...50 billion?

43:15.520 --> 43:19.960
Is the love of a woman worth
the destruction of an entire species?

43:23.030 --> 43:26.800
This is the sin I tried
to keep you from learning.

43:27.470 --> 43:30.870
Why I wanted to chase you from Rana.

43:32.510 --> 43:35.480
We're not qualified
to be your judges.

43:36.610 --> 43:39.450
We have no law to fit your crime.

43:49.720 --> 43:52.530
You're free
to return to the planet...

43:53.460 --> 43:56.030
...and to make Rishon live again.

44:07.240 --> 44:08.840
Helm, break orbit.

44:09.910 --> 44:11.250
Full impulse.

44:11.410 --> 44:15.020
Captain's log, stardate 43153.7.

44:15.580 --> 44:19.390
We are departing the Rana System
for Starbase 133.

44:19.520 --> 44:24.090
We leave a being of extraordinary
power and conscience.

44:24.560 --> 44:28.530
I'm not certain if he should be
praised or condemned.

44:29.200 --> 44:32.070
Only that he should be left alone.
