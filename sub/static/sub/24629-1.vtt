01:12.458 --> 01:16.583
Listen up, people.
Listen.

01:16.708 --> 01:20.708
Like a sinner, like a crawling animal ...

01:20.833 --> 01:24.291
... like a boar
that has trampled sacred things ...

01:26.375 --> 01:29.500
Let me tell you
how I endured the dark gospel ...

01:29.625 --> 01:32.791
... and how I can still breathe
while the mucus ...

01:32.916 --> 01:36.375
... to my broken leper lips
rising ...

01:36.500 --> 01:39.958
... and pornography, the threat
and the violence ...

01:40.083 --> 01:42.458
... rise to my braised throat.

01:46.083 --> 01:47.666
... while I'm not from it.

01:47.791 --> 01:52.916
And through which I can swim in hell,
without drowning in the bile.

01:53.041 --> 01:55.500
I'll tell you.
By love.

01:55.625 --> 01:59.000
By love, you beautiful people.
Love.

02:40.125 --> 02:43.083
Love is not a fleeting encounter
with a immoral angel.

02:43.958 --> 02:48.583
What I am talking about when I am
talk about love, is the kingdom ...

02:48.708 --> 02:52.416
... the land of cooling water
and where there is much love.

02:52.541 --> 02:56.208
It is a place that really exists.

03:01.416 --> 03:05.583
If that wasn't there, why tell
the Lord of balance then ...

03:06.583 --> 03:10.125
... that he has a place for you
and will prepare for me ...

03:10.250 --> 03:12.333
... and that he will return?

03:13.375 --> 03:15.083
Because there he is.

03:22.583 --> 03:26.791
You always became a girl
since.

03:26.916 --> 03:29.000
People often commented on it.

03:31.250 --> 03:33.666
You just went to high school.

03:35.625 --> 03:38.916
That was very expensive.
I remember that.

03:39.041 --> 03:46.333
A new uniform, a suitcase, pens,
a compass set, pencils ...

03:55.375 --> 03:57.750
It took me a week
to get it out.

03:59.708 --> 04:01.708
You loved those shoes.

04:02.583 --> 04:08.083
Written with 'George Best' on the sole.
You didn't want to wear anything else.

04:12.916 --> 04:15.291
George Best and Julie Beech.

04:16.208 --> 04:19.750
In that time
you were only interested in them.

04:24.666 --> 04:28.458
She wrote my name with a pen
on her jeans.

04:37.708 --> 04:40.500
She now lives in South Africa.

04:41.375 --> 04:43.916
She's doing well.

05:00.916 --> 05:03.958
Leave that damned.

05:04.083 --> 05:05.708
It is a slice.

05:10.583 --> 05:13.666
We demolished things,
we get hurt, we don't complain.

05:16.250 --> 05:20.500
Emma.
A real woman.

05:21.625 --> 05:23.333
She is a real woman.

05:24.250 --> 05:26.500
- Could you make me a steak?
- Joe?

05:26.625 --> 05:29.083
I dont need anything.
I have ten bags of chips on.

05:29.208 --> 05:31.583
And he has already eaten a Cow Pie.

05:41.291 --> 05:43.458
That's a forbidden fruit, boy.

05:45.791 --> 05:47.041
Forbidden.

05:54.041 --> 05:58.416
Do you already know my steak story?
-What steak story?

06:02.333 --> 06:06.875
Malky and I were in an Indian tent
after a visit to a night club ...

06:10.416 --> 06:12.833
This lightweight
slept in his tikka masala.

06:12.958 --> 06:15.041
He got no further than the starter.

06:15.166 --> 06:18.291
I ordered what I always take:
vindaloo, extra pedis.

06:18.416 --> 06:21.666
Malky has ordered a T-bean steak
because that jerk does not eat anything else.

06:21.791 --> 06:24.250
The steak is coming
and he just wants to take a bite if ...

06:24.375 --> 06:26.625
Boom.
It is completely free.

06:26.750 --> 06:31.208
It is just like the wild west.
There is a buzz party in the corner.

06:31.333 --> 06:34.291
Real acorns.
Firefighters who were not employed.

06:37.541 --> 06:39.291
Stupid drunk.

06:39.416 --> 06:41.958
They injured the immigrant waiters.

06:43.166 --> 06:47.083
Like in a slaughter room
in a slaughterhouse.

06:47.208 --> 06:49.333
So I'm telling Malky ...
I say, "Hey."

06:49.458 --> 06:51.375
He works away half a cow.
I say: "Hey."

06:51.500 --> 06:54.166
We have to go there
and help those poor ones ...

06:54.291 --> 06:56.083
... otherwise there will still be deaths. "

06:56.208 --> 06:59.791
And Malky says like a true Christian
with a heart of gold:

06:59.916 --> 07:01.916
"I have no service."

07:05.416 --> 07:09.875
Afterwards
one of those bastards jumps up ...

07:10.000 --> 07:12.750
... and damn he runs
over our table.

07:15.041 --> 07:17.791
He runs after a screaming waiter
with a bread knife.

07:17.916 --> 07:20.000
And then he stands ...

07:20.125 --> 07:21.750
... on Malky's steak.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.583
I mean it.

07:24.625 --> 07:26.541
We tackled them, boy.

07:31.208 --> 07:36.750
Ah, when you talk about the devil.
Now that you are there, dude.

07:45.208 --> 07:47.666
Please dear.
-Thank you, Emma.

07:51.458 --> 07:54.375
I'll take a look at it, Billy.
I was a nurse.

07:54.500 --> 07:55.583
Come here.

08:01.958 --> 08:05.791
O my God, have you seen this?

08:05.916 --> 08:07.458
It is a slice.

08:07.583 --> 08:11.250
Did you injure yourself on the demolition site?
Has he been treated for infections?

08:13.541 --> 08:16.791
No, he must go immediately
to the emergency department.

08:16.916 --> 08:18.916
Can you drive him there, Joe?
-What is it?

08:19.041 --> 08:22.541
No, I'm tired.
I can't even have a conversation.

08:25.125 --> 08:26.666
He may already have spread.

08:27.833 --> 08:32.041
Goddamnit.

08:33.416 --> 08:37.041
What do you mean?
-The infection.

08:37.166 --> 08:40.875
An infection can cost you your arm.
-No, he has to go to the hospital, Malky.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.375
The infection must not reach your heart.
-My heart?

08:44.500 --> 08:46.250
There is perhaps an alternative.

08:48.500 --> 08:50.208
It remains a gamble, but ...

08:53.541 --> 08:54.750
My mother?
-Yes.

08:54.875 --> 08:58.375
She can give a kiss on it, Billy.
Then you are fine again.

10:30.333 --> 10:32.250
Are you goddamn blind or something?

10:36.791 --> 10:39.250
Hey, where did that make sense?

10:40.375 --> 10:42.125
Nothing.

10:42.250 --> 10:43.875
It didn't seem like it was nothing.

10:46.416 --> 10:48.041
I'm just tired.

10:51.541 --> 10:56.375
It's okay. Just go.
Just go. It's okay.

12:47.875 --> 12:51.375
Can you get that black currant jam?
grab me?

12:51.500 --> 12:53.333
That?
-Yes thank you.

12:55.166 --> 12:57.666
I want some cookies.

12:58.666 --> 13:01.750
Chocolate cookies.
No, not that.

13:01.875 --> 13:03.125
Yes that one.

13:06.208 --> 13:07.333
And chips?
Do you want chips?

13:19.958 --> 13:23.041
Are you blind or something?
-Ho, what are you doing?

13:23.166 --> 13:25.791
Come, dude.
It is retarded.

13:28.583 --> 13:29.958
Do you want some coffee?

13:42.791 --> 13:44.541
Do you want a candy, Mom?

13:46.375 --> 13:49.375
You like it the best.
-No thanks.

13:57.125 --> 13:58.833
Are you mad at me?

14:01.166 --> 14:03.250
It looks like you're mad at me.

14:04.833 --> 14:08.208
Mom?
-No, I'm not mad at you.

14:10.916 --> 14:12.708
What do you want me to say?

14:14.500 --> 14:18.791
Those bastards didn't look out.
-Do you not want to use that language?

14:18.916 --> 14:21.958
I'm sorry, okay?

14:24.791 --> 14:27.250
He almost knocked you over.
I won't let that happen.

14:27.375 --> 14:30.416
But I didn't raise you like that.

15:05.500 --> 15:07.583
Do you want a cup of tea, Malcolm?

16:26.333 --> 16:27.875
You don't feel well.

16:29.458 --> 16:33.250
I can see it on your face.
Your face is tense.

16:33.375 --> 16:34.708
I'm just tired.

16:35.791 --> 16:38.541
You don't have too much ...
-Mam.

16:38.666 --> 16:42.000
You are my son.
I feel it when something is wrong.

16:43.666 --> 16:45.541
Can't I just be tired?

16:46.791 --> 16:51.458
Is it hard work?
Demolish churches?

16:54.208 --> 16:59.708
It's God's house.
-Yes. Well, it's being demolished.

17:02.250 --> 17:04.250
You should go to confession.

17:08.875 --> 17:12.833
That new church is very beautiful.
I've seen it. It is very beautiful.

17:17.790 --> 17:19.583
I have to go back to work.

17:31.541 --> 17:34.208
Are you Malky?
I'm Paul.

17:38.250 --> 17:41.375
The cross is mine. The foreman
said you had to take it down.

17:41.500 --> 17:42.916
Give me a minute.

17:48.375 --> 17:51.833
It is a beautiful building. I am
always been fond of Saint Michael's.

19:21.791 --> 19:23.416
Shall I tackle it?

19:24.916 --> 19:26.166
Get out of the way.

19:41.708 --> 19:44.041
Hey, friend.
Thank you very much.

19:44.166 --> 19:45.791
I have a new place for it.

21:35.083 --> 21:41.416
I'm going to cum.
Oh my God.

22:04.250 --> 22:06.458
When I was little,
I went to church here.

22:06.583 --> 22:08.791
It is a pity.
It was a beautiful place.

22:11.958 --> 22:14.666
It's just me
a lot of stones and cement.

22:16.500 --> 22:18.625
I did not see you.

22:18.750 --> 22:22.750
I came by last week.
I knocked on the door.

22:22.875 --> 22:24.583
I thought I heard the TV on.

22:25.708 --> 22:27.041
I'm working, Em.

22:29.666 --> 22:31.208
Is it me?

22:33.541 --> 22:36.041
I have to go back to work.
-You didn't come by.

22:39.500 --> 22:42.666
I thought
that our relationship was not serious.

22:49.875 --> 22:51.333
Is it over now?

22:59.791 --> 23:04.500
You know, you always do this to me, Malky.
You do it every time.

24:19.625 --> 24:20.875
It is my fault.

24:24.375 --> 24:25.625
It's not you.

24:26.750 --> 24:28.041
It is my fault.

24:40.625 --> 24:42.083
Whose girl are you?

24:46.708 --> 24:48.166
I'm your girl.

26:56.166 --> 26:58.375
Mom, what are you doing?

26:59.791 --> 27:02.458
My damn back almost breaks.

27:02.583 --> 27:05.291
That doesn't surprise me.
Where do you want it?

27:05.416 --> 27:07.791
In addition to the other one.

27:09.791 --> 27:13.333
Why do you also wear heavy pots?
I said that I will lift the heavy things.

27:13.458 --> 27:14.958
You can't do everything for me.

27:15.083 --> 27:19.083
I am independant. I have to
to do something yourself.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.458
How is your back?
- He's slowing down, that's the way it is.

27:23.583 --> 27:28.916
And old, like me.
I'll make some tea.

27:35.333 --> 27:39.250
One tea bag is enough
for two cups.

27:53.625 --> 27:57.708
POPULAR PRIEST TURNS 30 YEARS
BACK TO LOCAL PAROCHIE

29:58.958 --> 30:02.583
Hey, can you give me a ride?
On the way to work?

30:05.041 --> 30:07.416
It's not on your route, is it?
Do not you mind?

30:12.375 --> 30:13.750
Is something wrong?

30:14.708 --> 30:17.708
I'm fine.
Okay?

30:19.083 --> 30:20.458
I'm just tired.

30:22.708 --> 30:24.416
Your cell phone rang.

30:29.333 --> 30:32.666
It's just Pete.
He picks me up on the way to work.

30:32.791 --> 30:37.333
I didn't know I was sleeping with you.
He comes by my house, so ...

30:42.750 --> 30:45.625
He picks you up and drops you off ...

30:49.125 --> 30:52.750
I'm just saying
that it's nice of him.

30:55.500 --> 30:57.333
Did I do something wrong?

30:58.958 --> 31:02.083
I didn't do anything wrong, right?

31:08.875 --> 31:12.458
You know what, I don't need a lift. I will go
walk. I need a fresh nose.

31:12.583 --> 31:14.625
What should I think about it?

31:15.750 --> 31:18.125
I'm going to the pub for you.
Often you don't see me standing.

31:18.250 --> 31:20.625
That is not true.
-Then I'll go there ...

31:20.750 --> 31:24.500
... to surprise you because I thought
that you would like that ...

31:24.625 --> 31:26.500
... and then you get into the car with a guy.

31:30.000 --> 31:33.708
He calls everyone baby.
- He calls you damn sweetheart.

31:33.833 --> 31:38.750
Don't scold me.
Is it me or am I missing something?

31:38.875 --> 31:41.041
Is it because I don't often
have come by?

31:41.166 --> 31:42.833
Have you had enough of me?

31:44.250 --> 31:46.541
I did not do anything.
- If you don't want me, say so.

31:46.666 --> 31:50.375
Then say what I would have done.
-If you want to leave, you can leave.

31:54.291 --> 31:55.625
I do not need you.

31:57.750 --> 31:59.333
Do you think I need you?

32:01.583 --> 32:04.958
I don't need you damn you.
I do not need anyone.

32:19.125 --> 32:20.625
It looks like it's over.

32:23.625 --> 32:26.750
It is not out.
You do what you always do.

32:26.875 --> 32:28.958
You get angry because you are scared.

32:29.083 --> 32:31.750
Anxious? What am I afraid of then?
-I do not know.

32:31.875 --> 32:34.250
I do not know.
You tell me.

32:34.375 --> 32:39.000
You always care
and then blame me for it.

32:39.125 --> 32:42.916
I'm too old for these games, Malky.
You're too old for that.

32:44.750 --> 32:48.583
I'm still there?
-No you're not.

32:50.083 --> 32:51.458
You are not there.

32:52.500 --> 32:55.208
I mean, you look like yourself,
but you are not yourself.

32:59.791 --> 33:01.875
You are a stranger to me.

33:04.250 --> 33:06.125
I'm just tired, okay?
-Liar.

33:06.250 --> 33:08.833
God.
You can't even be honest with me.

33:14.750 --> 33:16.208
You don't trust me.

33:19.291 --> 33:20.833
Do you trust me?

33:25.458 --> 33:27.041
You don't trust me.

33:34.166 --> 33:35.875
No, why would you too?

33:36.000 --> 33:39.291
I mean, we only have
four years a relationship.

33:39.416 --> 33:42.958
I take off my pants for you.
I suck your dick for you.

33:43.083 --> 33:46.875
I fuck you in a dirty pub cellar
if it suits you.

33:47.000 --> 33:51.791
And why? Oh yeah. I know. Yes.
Because it's not serious.

36:00.958 --> 36:02.625
Another glass, please, honey.

36:13.208 --> 36:17.166
By the way, I talked to your guy.
I told him clearly ...

36:17.291 --> 36:20.583
... that if he doesn't take care of you,
I add you to my harem.

36:22.416 --> 36:25.000
I don't know what's wrong.
- How do you think I feel?

36:25.125 --> 36:28.375
I introduced you to each other.
- So it's your fault.

36:37.125 --> 36:41.291
Have I ever told you my steak story?
-Only 100 times or so.

36:49.583 --> 36:53.125
Malky and I were in an Indian
restaurant when it all started.

36:54.083 --> 36:55.625
I told you.

36:59.541 --> 37:01.333
... to spill some blood.

37:02.666 --> 37:05.083
But he didn't want to do it.

37:05.208 --> 37:09.958
"I can't do it, Joe. My mother
sits at home. My mom is home.'

37:10.083 --> 37:12.916
You know what he is like
with his old mother.

37:15.333 --> 37:18.708
Malky and I beat everything that moved.

37:19.583 --> 37:22.541
Bodies fell to the ground
and heads fell open.

37:23.458 --> 37:26.333
Everything turned red rather quickly.

37:28.625 --> 37:31.666
Then there were police officers
at the door.

37:37.125 --> 37:39.166
And I stand there with a ...

37:42.416 --> 37:44.166
... hammer in my hand.

37:46.791 --> 37:48.333
Blood is dripping from it.

37:56.208 --> 37:59.208
I mean, I'm really crying
because...

37:59.333 --> 38:02.458
... I know what I did
and can't believe I did it.

38:02.583 --> 38:05.833
And I say to Malky ...
I beg him, I say:

38:05.958 --> 38:07.916
"I can't turn around, Malky.

38:08.875 --> 38:11.041
I can't serve a prison sentence.

38:11.166 --> 38:13.125
I have children at home.

38:19.250 --> 38:20.458
So...

38:21.541 --> 38:26.166
... Malky takes the hammer
and throws it through the doors.

38:27.125 --> 38:29.458
The agents are coming in
and arrest him.

38:36.458 --> 38:38.375
He is brave.

38:39.958 --> 38:42.041
He said I had nothing to do with it.

38:47.166 --> 38:49.041
He took it all on himself.

38:52.791 --> 38:54.583
I know you know ...

38:54.708 --> 38:58.000
... that he was in jail
before you met.

38:59.875 --> 39:03.000
But you don't know
that he was in jail for me.

39:09.166 --> 39:10.208
Come here.

39:22.000 --> 39:26.875
'After all, we now look through it
of a mirror in a mystery ...

39:27.000 --> 39:30.291
... but then we will see
face to face.

39:30.416 --> 39:33.875
Now I know in part ...

39:34.000 --> 39:38.500
... but then I will know,
as I am known myself.

39:38.625 --> 39:44.291
And now faith, hope and love remain. "

42:21.750 --> 42:23.458
Is it at work?

42:25.333 --> 42:30.708
There is hard work today
to find. Do your best in this position.

42:30.833 --> 42:32.541
It's not working, mom.

42:38.583 --> 42:40.208
You ...

42:40.333 --> 42:44.041
The police won't
stop by again, boy?

42:44.916 --> 42:46.541
I couldn't handle it.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.041
I'm tonight
went to that church of yours.

42:54.291 --> 42:55.916
The new.

42:59.166 --> 43:03.375
You probably want to put your hammer in there,
or not?

43:04.958 --> 43:08.666
There are many churches.
You cannot demolish them all.

43:16.708 --> 43:18.500
He's not a good person, mom.

43:24.375 --> 43:27.916
He was always nice to us.

43:30.250 --> 43:36.458
He has a family, you know that?
He has nephews and nieces.

43:36.583 --> 43:38.833
He doesn't deserve this.

43:42.916 --> 43:45.458
See you.
You should see your face.

43:46.916 --> 43:50.916
You are ice cold. You judge people.
That's wrong with you.

43:51.041 --> 43:52.958
Judging is a sin.

43:56.916 --> 44:01.250
That's the bad behavior
so you ended up in jail ...

44:01.375 --> 44:05.583
... and you damn me for two years
left alone.

44:05.708 --> 44:09.333
The neighbors gossiped behind my back.

44:09.458 --> 44:11.375
The shame ...

44:13.583 --> 44:14.958
Sorry.

44:18.583 --> 44:20.791
I don't know what has happened lately
is wrong with you.

44:22.750 --> 44:25.541
You have no compassion.
You think I can handle it.

44:25.666 --> 44:27.833
Well, I can't handle it.

44:27.958 --> 44:31.833
My nerves can't handle it.
I can not handle it any longer.

45:37.416 --> 45:38.750
Are you okay?

45:39.958 --> 45:41.500
What do you want again?

45:45.458 --> 45:47.041
I do like a fire.

45:58.041 --> 46:00.750
I killed my own father
when I was 16.

46:01.750 --> 46:05.541
I had to go from the age of seven
sucking his cock.

46:07.083 --> 46:09.375
My father forced me
to suck his cock.

46:10.541 --> 46:12.833
He said it was ok
to enjoy it.

46:27.833 --> 46:30.250
I beheaded him
with my mother's meat cleaver.

46:30.375 --> 46:32.083
I neatly chopped it off.

46:55.458 --> 46:58.166
Do you know how heavy a severed head is?

47:00.333 --> 47:02.375
I know all about anger.

47:02.500 --> 47:05.583
I have two years
in a psychiatric ward.

47:05.708 --> 47:09.750
Seven years under the treatment of one
prison psychiatrist and then I found God.

47:09.875 --> 47:11.833
That's not why I'm here.

47:13.416 --> 47:15.833
They tried everything with me,
do you know.

47:15.958 --> 47:18.666
Psychoanalysis, therapy ...

47:24.375 --> 47:26.958
It was not enough.
There was too much shame.

47:28.541 --> 47:32.250
I couldn't tell anyone, you know?
Who can you tell?

47:33.625 --> 47:35.583
People judge, brother.

47:37.291 --> 47:38.750
You can't trust people.

47:39.708 --> 47:43.416
They even unconsciously judge.

47:47.416 --> 47:49.208
An old priest in prison ...

47:52.625 --> 47:54.125
... gave me this one.

47:56.125 --> 47:58.166
"Tell him everything," he said.

47:59.041 --> 48:01.958
"All the dirty details,
especially the gore details.

48:02.083 --> 48:05.458
The parts, the images, the memories.
Throw it all out.

48:07.375 --> 48:09.416
Drive out the demons. "

48:24.166 --> 48:30.666
He won't judge you.

48:31.708 --> 48:33.916
He gives no sense of shame.

50:45.458 --> 50:47.125
I don't trust you, Em.

51:24.500 --> 51:25.916
Are you ready for Hull?

51:28.041 --> 51:30.125
I don't feel like Hull.

51:32.791 --> 51:35.000
Hull?
The next job.

51:36.166 --> 51:38.208
Apparently it is full of holes.

51:39.666 --> 51:43.000
I did a job there. That has to be
have been ten years ago.

51:43.125 --> 51:45.291
What a bloody hole.

51:45.416 --> 51:47.958
It is damn rough.

51:48.083 --> 51:51.833
But it is two months of work.
That has to be.

51:52.750 --> 51:55.083
That's what it's ultimately all about, brother.

52:04.666 --> 52:07.541
Do something different?
What do you mean?

52:08.500 --> 52:10.708
You know, something else.

52:10.833 --> 52:12.875
Instead of demolishing things.

52:13.750 --> 52:15.500
I like to demolish things.

52:15.625 --> 52:17.625
I know that, but ...
-I am good at it.

52:18.625 --> 52:20.416
You're damn good at it too.

52:22.041 --> 52:25.291
Nobody can demolish a building
like you, dude.

52:25.416 --> 52:26.708
Besides...

52:27.708 --> 52:30.333
... I can only handle it
with wrecking balls and hammers.

52:41.625 --> 52:43.416
I always have a certain dream.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.500
It is not really a dream,
it's a nightmare.

52:51.333 --> 52:54.875
I appear at the next demolition,
the next job ...

52:55.000 --> 52:58.916
... I am coming in my car
with my hammer and my tools ...

53:00.041 --> 53:02.041
... and it appears
to be my mother's house.

53:03.750 --> 53:05.250
My mother's house.

53:09.583 --> 53:11.666
I talk to the foreman.
I say:

53:14.166 --> 53:16.208
"That's my mother's house, damn it."

53:17.125 --> 53:18.458
He does...

53:19.791 --> 53:21.958
He doesn't care.

53:22.083 --> 53:25.166
He has the address of a building,
goes there and breaks it.

53:25.291 --> 53:29.375
"It's a job,
it's not personal. " I say no.

53:33.166 --> 53:37.125
It's damn very personal.
It's my mother's damn house.

53:38.125 --> 53:41.166
It is my mother's house. "

53:43.250 --> 53:45.791
The crane swings the wrecking ball.

53:47.000 --> 53:48.458
My heart is pounding.

53:48.583 --> 53:51.333
The foreman walks away.
'Not my problem.'

53:51.458 --> 53:52.833
And I'm going crazy ...

53:52.958 --> 53:55.500
... because I don't even know
if my mother is still inside.

53:55.625 --> 53:58.833
I'm trying to call her,
but the phone does not ring.

53:58.958 --> 54:02.000
I gesture to the crane driver,
but he doesn't see me.

54:02.125 --> 54:04.708
I'm trying to tell someone
to everyone:

54:13.583 --> 54:14.791
And what happens then?

54:15.791 --> 54:18.166
I wake up like the wrecking ball
hit her roof.

54:18.291 --> 54:19.625
I can't save her.

54:53.833 --> 54:56.291
Malky, what the hell is going on,
man?

55:11.541 --> 55:13.250
Malky, don't.
No.

55:15.750 --> 55:18.416
Don't be stupid.
Malky.

55:56.791 --> 55:59.250
What the hell are you doing here?

56:01.791 --> 56:05.041
Look at me.

56:55.041 --> 56:56.625
I don't trust you, Em.

57:01.541 --> 57:03.000
I do not trust you.

57:04.291 --> 57:06.333
I don't trust myself, Emma.

57:07.541 --> 57:09.541
I'm afraid to trust someone.

57:10.500 --> 57:12.750
I'm afraid not to trust anyone.

57:22.291 --> 57:24.583
... I don't trust my own hands.

57:56.541 --> 58:00.791
The tendons are severely damaged
and surgery must be performed immediately.

58:01.708 --> 58:05.541
Just attach it.
-He needs surgery.

58:08.916 --> 58:13.416
Okay, I can't force you, but you will
can then no longer use that hand.

58:31.500 --> 58:33.125
How are you, Mom?

58:34.625 --> 58:37.000
I can't come by tonight.
I'm normal...

58:37.125 --> 58:39.708
No, I'm fine.
I am alone...

58:40.750 --> 58:42.250
I'm busy, mom.

58:43.125 --> 58:44.958
With work and all that, you know?

58:48.208 --> 58:50.041
Shall I come by tomorrow?

58:52.958 --> 58:54.458
See you tomorrow.

01:00:27.666 --> 01:00:30.708
What do you think?
Which one do you want?

01:00:31.583 --> 01:00:32.708
That.

01:00:36.208 --> 01:00:37.458
B-ten ...

01:01:57.708 --> 01:01:58.875
God?

01:02:00.916 --> 01:02:02.708
He didn't let you down

01:02:04.333 --> 01:02:06.583
You have abandoned yourself.

01:02:06.708 --> 01:02:10.833
Have you abandoned yourself?
-What do you want from me?

01:02:17.833 --> 01:02:20.625
Why do you keep trying
to attract my attention?

01:02:35.083 --> 01:02:36.791
I'll listen to you.

01:02:36.916 --> 01:02:39.166
Sometimes you have
only need a listening ear.

01:02:41.041 --> 01:02:45.208
Why should I talk to you?
I do not know you. I don't trust you.

01:02:46.291 --> 01:02:49.750
You don't know yourself.
You don't trust yourself.

01:02:58.708 --> 01:03:03.291
I see God in you, Malky.
You must be very brave now.

01:03:03.416 --> 01:03:06.458
Put your burden on the feet
of Jesus Christ, brother.

01:03:47.333 --> 01:03:49.541
Do you know what I see in you, priest?

01:03:52.125 --> 01:03:53.625
I see a boy.

01:03:54.583 --> 01:03:59.041
I see a little boy
with a large knife ...

01:03:59.166 --> 01:04:02.500
... that still has the taste of a cock
trying to get out of his throat.

01:04:05.166 --> 01:04:09.083
So what did you enjoy more, brother?

01:04:10.750 --> 01:04:15.458
Blow your dad or behead him
with your mother's meat cleaver?

01:04:25.083 --> 01:04:28.916
You bastard.
I'll break you, you bastard.

01:04:39.625 --> 01:04:43.291
Jesus. Sorry, brother.
Forgive me, man.

01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:06.958
You cannot wear this cross yourself.
I will help you to bear the burden.

01:05:07.083 --> 01:05:10.041
Please let me ease your burden.

01:05:23.958 --> 01:05:26.333
He didn't even know it was me, Em.

01:05:27.458 --> 01:05:31.375
I swear.
He didn't know it was me.

01:05:33.333 --> 01:05:35.541
He was blinded by anger.

01:05:36.750 --> 01:05:40.875
It could have been anyone.
But that wasn't true, right, Joe?

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.666
No, it was you. You stood there.
His best friend.

01:05:46.666 --> 01:05:50.250
Well, if this is the worst
what happens to me this week is fine with me.

01:05:53.958 --> 01:05:55.916
I don't talk his behavior well.

01:05:59.208 --> 01:06:00.500
I am indebted to him.

01:06:02.916 --> 01:06:04.166
You know?

01:06:05.541 --> 01:06:07.125
I really owe him.

01:06:11.125 --> 01:06:13.291
Every time I go to him again ...

01:06:14.208 --> 01:06:17.375
Every time I go to his apartment
or to work ...

01:06:18.291 --> 01:06:19.708
... then I know.

01:06:19.833 --> 01:06:23.291
Before I arrive
even before I leave ...

01:06:23.416 --> 01:06:26.208
... I know that's the worst
what can I do.

01:06:27.208 --> 01:06:29.833
It's the last thing I should do,
but...

01:06:30.833 --> 01:06:32.333
And after that...

01:06:38.541 --> 01:06:42.500
And then I ask him again:
'Is it me?

01:06:42.625 --> 01:06:44.541
Did I do something wrong? "

01:06:45.958 --> 01:06:50.125
Come on, Em.
- It's okay.

01:06:51.208 --> 01:06:55.125
Please don't feel sorry for me.
Then I don't have it anymore.

01:07:51.333 --> 01:07:52.625
Mom?

01:09:17.291 --> 01:09:19.457
Do you remember when I was 12, Mom?

01:09:21.791 --> 01:09:23.041
Do you remember that?

01:09:27.082 --> 01:09:29.166
When I returned from the church?

01:09:30.625 --> 01:09:33.041
When I slept in church?

01:09:34.291 --> 01:09:35.582
When I...

01:09:37.707 --> 01:09:39.207
I was quiet.

01:09:42.666 --> 01:09:43.916
Quiet.

01:09:47.666 --> 01:09:49.375
You said I was quiet.

01:09:51.125 --> 01:09:53.166
I was silent for three days.

01:09:56.250 --> 01:09:57.708
Silent, damn it.

01:10:00.916 --> 01:10:02.583
I was lifeless.

01:10:05.958 --> 01:10:07.666
You said to me ...

01:10:09.958 --> 01:10:11.500
You provoked me.

01:10:14.458 --> 01:10:16.583
You teased me.

01:10:19.958 --> 01:10:23.041
"Talk to me, Malcolm.
Tell me.

01:10:23.166 --> 01:10:27.416
You don't feel well.
I can see it on your face.

01:10:27.541 --> 01:10:29.750
Your face is tense.

01:10:34.625 --> 01:10:36.875
What happened to you?

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.750
You can tell me.
I am your mother.

01:10:41.875 --> 01:10:43.541
You can trust me. "

01:10:56.125 --> 01:10:57.541
So I'll tell you.

01:10:59.875 --> 01:11:01.375
I trust you.

01:11:09.208 --> 01:11:11.125
I have to trust you.

01:11:15.333 --> 01:11:16.833
I suffer.

01:11:17.875 --> 01:11:20.500
And why should I not trust you?
You are my mother.

01:11:23.375 --> 01:11:26.875
I have to tell someone.
I suffer.

01:11:34.041 --> 01:11:36.125
Do you remember what you said to me, Mom?

01:11:38.166 --> 01:11:40.125
Do you remember what you said?

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.083
... and I was devastated.

01:11:49.208 --> 01:11:51.208
I cried and cried.

01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:55.291
And what did you say to me?

01:11:58.750 --> 01:12:02.583
"That didn't happen to you."

01:12:06.125 --> 01:12:07.875
That hurt, Mom.

01:12:10.875 --> 01:12:13.375
"That didn't happen to you."

01:12:14.250 --> 01:12:16.958
Your guilt
is not my responsibility.

01:12:17.875 --> 01:12:21.250
Your shame
is not my responsibility.

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:26.625
I damn my own shame
what I'm struggling with.

01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:30.166
I'm lying there while he touches me.

01:12:33.625 --> 01:12:35.875
I'm a goddamn 12 year old.

01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:45.166
How dare you, mom?
How the hell do you dare? How dare you?

01:12:47.791 --> 01:12:51.291
I lay there crying and praying
and in my head I begged ...

01:12:51.416 --> 01:12:56.708
... and the only thing I thought is:
my mother...

01:12:56.833 --> 01:13:00.125
My mother will be so mad at me.

01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:06.458
Tell me what to do. I promise I will
everything will do what you say. I promise.

01:13:06.583 --> 01:13:09.375
I just want everything to be
as it used to be.

01:13:10.416 --> 01:13:12.208
I will not disappoint you.

01:13:13.125 --> 01:13:15.875
I will not shame you.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.583
I promise.

01:14:08.958 --> 01:14:11.500
ROMANS 12, 13

01:14:18.083 --> 01:14:20.375
IF THEN YOUR ENEMY HAVES HUNGER,
GIVE HIM TO EAT

01:14:22.583 --> 01:14:25.875
FOR BY DOING THAT, YOU WILL
FIERY COALS ON HIS HEAD

01:14:52.541 --> 01:14:54.958
I'll be that priest
never forgotten in prison.

01:14:55.083 --> 01:14:57.416
The one who saved me.

01:14:57.541 --> 01:15:00.541
Everyone else had my ragged soul
already specified.

01:15:02.333 --> 01:15:04.750
He offered me salvation.

01:15:04.875 --> 01:15:07.916
Absolution.
But I had to make the effort myself.

01:15:08.916 --> 01:15:11.125
He gave me the tape recorder.

01:15:11.250 --> 01:15:14.625
"Tell him your secrets," he said.
"Tell him everything.

01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:19.083
Cleaves every piece of wood,
lift each stone ...

01:15:19.208 --> 01:15:21.416
... and leave everything else to God. "

01:15:28.708 --> 01:15:32.500
'Don't you think you are this burden
long enough with you?

01:15:32.625 --> 01:15:35.083
And it's not even
your burden to wear. "

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.583
I said...
I almost spit this out.

01:15:37.708 --> 01:15:41.625
"I don't want him to get away
what he did to me. "

01:15:45.083 --> 01:15:48.458
That old priest laughed.
He kept smiling.

01:15:48.583 --> 01:15:54.375
He said: "Aha.
Well, Paul, I can really help you with this.

01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:57.291
I know something in this area
what you don't know.

01:15:57.416 --> 01:16:01.708
No one
escapes the master of balance.

01:16:05.583 --> 01:16:07.250
Not even in death. "

01:16:10.416 --> 01:16:12.416
I promise you, Malcolm ...

01:16:13.875 --> 01:16:17.583
I will make a solemn promise to you
on this holy ground.

01:16:17.708 --> 01:16:22.916
The day will come that even his own skin
will testify against him.

01:16:56.875 --> 01:16:58.791
I abuse myself.

01:17:04.916 --> 01:17:06.875
I hurt myself ...

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:10.166
...physical.

01:17:23.916 --> 01:17:26.541
I hurt myself sexually.

01:17:35.708 --> 01:17:37.916
I raped myself.

01:17:42.125 --> 01:17:45.500
I raped myself until I bleed.

01:18:05.250 --> 01:18:09.250
I dig and dig ...

01:18:11.791 --> 01:18:14.166
... and try its roots in me
to delete.

01:18:53.125 --> 01:18:55.458
Forgive me, father, because I have sinned.

01:19:00.791 --> 01:19:02.333
Twenty five years ...

01:19:03.625 --> 01:19:09.958
... eleven months and three days ago
that I have confessed for the last time.

01:19:14.416 --> 01:19:18.583
Twenty five years?
What do you want to confess?

01:19:20.541 --> 01:19:22.458
Something I haven't done yet.

01:19:23.958 --> 01:19:27.041
Tell.
- I have to hurt someone.

01:19:29.125 --> 01:19:31.833
I have to hurt a lot.

01:19:34.166 --> 01:19:35.416
Continue.

01:19:41.541 --> 01:19:44.250
I trusted a man 25 years ago.

01:19:47.416 --> 01:19:49.375
No, that is actually not true.

01:19:51.041 --> 01:19:52.541
I didn't trust him.

01:19:55.416 --> 01:19:57.000
I was 12 years old.

01:19:59.833 --> 01:20:01.833
It had nothing to do with confidence.

01:20:04.041 --> 01:20:05.791
I worshiped him.

01:20:16.583 --> 01:20:20.791
He said I had something other boys did
did not have. He said I was special.

01:20:22.250 --> 01:20:24.041
Special.

01:20:31.875 --> 01:20:33.666
I was only 12.

01:20:35.375 --> 01:20:38.625
When I woke up the next day,
I felt 100 years old.

01:20:42.791 --> 01:20:45.958
He said God would know
if I would tell someone.

01:20:46.083 --> 01:20:48.291
That God would punish me.

01:20:53.166 --> 01:20:55.291
God didn't have to punish me.

01:20:56.833 --> 01:20:59.291
I punished myself ...

01:20:59.416 --> 01:21:05.208
...every day.
Every day for 25 years.

01:21:08.958 --> 01:21:10.750
What do you want?

01:21:11.791 --> 01:21:13.833
Revenge.

01:21:16.750 --> 01:21:19.625
I'm not sure
whether you are in the right place here.

01:21:25.625 --> 01:21:28.166
I don't think I ...
- He abused me.

01:21:35.958 --> 01:21:38.208
When he put his cock in me ...

01:21:39.916 --> 01:21:45.916
When he put his avid cock in me,
he shortened my life.

01:21:47.375 --> 01:21:48.958
He is my enemy.

01:21:49.875 --> 01:21:54.083
He's damn my enemy.
Go ...

01:21:55.208 --> 01:21:56.791
...to sit.

01:21:58.625 --> 01:22:00.458
Sit down.

01:22:02.916 --> 01:22:04.708
Sit down, damn it.

01:22:33.916 --> 01:22:35.291
I was a boy.

01:22:37.208 --> 01:22:38.708
I was just a boy.

01:22:43.708 --> 01:22:45.458
Why are you here?

01:22:53.541 --> 01:22:55.541
Do you know Romans?

01:22:59.958 --> 01:23:01.708
Verse 12:20?

01:23:07.416 --> 01:23:10.875
Do you know Romans?
-Yes.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.208
Well, you know why I'm here.

01:23:28.458 --> 01:23:32.541
He abused me
when I was a boy, father.

01:23:58.666 --> 01:24:00.791
... that I forgive him.

01:24:08.125 --> 01:24:09.916
I forgive him.

01:27:02.375 --> 01:27:04.166
A reading from ...

01:27:05.125 --> 01:27:06.791
... the book of Paul ...

01:27:09.333 --> 01:27:12.375
... and his letters to the Romans.

01:27:15.666 --> 01:27:17.666
Chapter 12.

01:27:19.833 --> 01:27:21.541
Verse 20.

01:27:25.083 --> 01:27:26.750
'Me...

01:27:27.791 --> 01:27:29.958
... revenge is due.

01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:37.000
I will ...

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.458
... return ...

01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:42.458
... says the Lord.

01:27:44.833 --> 01:27:46.208
If then...

01:27:47.083 --> 01:27:51.250
... your enemy is hungry,
feed him.

01:27:55.250 --> 01:27:57.041
When he is thirsty ...

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.916
... give him a drink ...

01:28:05.125 --> 01:28:07.416
... because by doing that ...

01:28:09.833 --> 01:28:12.458
... you will have fiery coals ...

01:28:14.666 --> 01:28:16.750
... hope for his head. "

01:29:12.708 --> 01:29:18.041
Congratulations, dear Sophie
