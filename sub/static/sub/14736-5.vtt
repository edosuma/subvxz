Your fashion magazines
are fascinating.

00:12.303 --> 00:13.474
Everyone's dressed in rags.

00:13.474 --> 00:15.396
I know it's confusing,
but in this time,

00:15.396 --> 00:18.349
dressing like a peasant
means you're cool.

00:18.349 --> 00:20.641
In my time,
dressing like a peasant
means you're a peasant

00:20.641 --> 00:24.024
and you're going to die
an early death.

00:24.024 --> 00:27.488

Barry and Naldo
are in the middle of
an epic prank war.

00:44.465 --> 00:47.428
A prank war?
Is that anything like
a land war?

00:47.428 --> 00:52.473
Kind of, but there's nothing
at stake and it's a huge waste
of time.

00:52.473 --> 00:56.767
Renaldo! What a coincidence
running into you
in the backyard like that.

00:56.767 --> 00:59.180
It's not a coincidence.
You ran around the front
of the house,

00:59.180 --> 01:00.811
grabbed my arm
and yanked me in here.

01:00.811 --> 01:05.525

we sure do have some
good times, don't we?

01:05.525 --> 01:09.570

in this stool

01:09.570 --> 01:11.572

Oh, a prank war.
Now I get it!

01:31.922 --> 01:33.634
It's like when
the town fool and
the village idiot

01:33.634 --> 01:36.267
compete to be
the county moron!

01:36.267 --> 01:37.518
Pretty much.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.562
Shelby, permission to
borrow your stools?

01:41.562 --> 01:42.853

Underground roller derby!

Let's go ask my mom
for permission!

03:24.245 --> 03:26.537
No! Absolutely not.

03:28.379 --> 03:31.382
Don't worry, Cyd,

your prank war.
 Not a chance.

04:03.574 --> 04:07.288
Oh, come on,
princesses never get to
do anything like this.

04:07.288 --> 04:09.460
I want to mix it up
with you commoners,
you know,

04:09.460 --> 04:11.752
get my hands dirty
like Archibald Swindon.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.133
Oh, is he a prankster?

04:13.133 --> 04:15.676
No, he's a grave digger.
Filthy, filthy hands.

04:18.007 --> 04:20.380
Daisy, we've been doing this
since the fifth grade.

04:20.380 --> 04:22.142
It's not something
you just jump into.

04:22.142 --> 04:24.725
Renaldo is right.
Prank wars are
no laughing matter.

04:24.725 --> 04:26.847

 (LAUGHING)

04:26.847 --> 04:29.600

04:29.600 --> 04:32.152
Once you start living
the prank life,
there's no going back.

04:32.152 --> 04:33.654
Before long,
you're chewing pepper gum

04:33.654 --> 04:35.195
just to see
if you can handle it,

04:35.195 --> 04:37.738
and dropping itch powder
down your own shorts.

04:37.738 --> 04:40.661
It changes you.

04:40.661 --> 04:43.614
Wow, Barry,

 (VOCALIZING)

04:45.616 --> 04:48.499
I didn't see that coming,
and I've been doing this
for years.

04:50.871 --> 04:52.873
Perhaps you're right.
I should just stick to

04:52.873 --> 04:54.625
the things
princesses know best.

04:54.625 --> 04:57.758
Planning lavish feasts,
waltzing with dukes,

04:57.758 --> 04:59.680
knighting defenders of
the crown...

04:59.680 --> 05:01.011
Wait, wait, wait.
You can knight people?

05:01.011 --> 05:02.182
Of course. I'm royalty.

05:02.182 --> 05:05.185
(CHUCKLES) Can I have
a moment? Renaldo.

05:05.185 --> 05:07.428
If I got knighted,
I could join the ranks of

05:07.428 --> 05:09.640
some of the greatest
minds of all time.

05:09.640 --> 05:12.022
Sir Isaac Newton,
Sir Bill Gates.

05:12.022 --> 05:14.104
I could be
Sir Barry Eisenberg.

05:14.104 --> 05:16.697
Imagine how good
that would look on
a college application

05:16.697 --> 05:19.780
or on the side
of my latte.

05:19.780 --> 05:23.243
We gotta be knights!
Think about the exciting
adventures we'd have.

05:23.243 --> 05:26.577
Fighting dragons,
riding unicorns,
hanging with the trolls.

05:26.577 --> 05:28.158
Renaldo, you can't do
any of those things.

05:28.158 --> 05:30.621
Yeah, because I'm not
a knight yet.

05:31.712 --> 05:34.334
Daisy, we'd like you
to knight us.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.756
So how do we do this?

05:35.756 --> 05:37.798
Well, you'd have to
complete a quest,

05:37.798 --> 05:39.920
an act of bravery,
and an act of chivalry.

05:39.920 --> 05:41.462
I guess I could set
something up.

05:41.462 --> 05:43.053
Make it happen, Princess.

05:43.053 --> 05:45.556
Renaldo, we are hereby,
suspending the prank war.

05:45.556 --> 05:48.228
In that case,
don't use your toilet paper.
 What did you do?

05:48.228 --> 05:51.732
Replaced it with sand paper
soaked in lemon juice.

05:51.732 --> 05:54.645
I know I should be mad,
but I'm actually impressed.

05:54.645 --> 05:56.647
And frankly,
a little bit terrified.

06:02.903 --> 06:06.156
It's so unfair my mom
won't let us go to
the roller derby.

06:06.156 --> 06:07.988
Let's just go anyway.

06:07.988 --> 06:10.831
It's easy for you to say.
You don't have to face
your mom when we get caught.

06:10.831 --> 06:14.044
True, the worst I have to
deal with is an angry text
from Peru.

06:14.044 --> 06:17.708
That's why I turn
my phone off when
I'm acting out.

06:17.708 --> 06:19.760
Well, I don't want to risk
getting my mom's patented

06:19.760 --> 06:21.882
"I raised you
better than that" look.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.714
It's like watching
Bret and Chet do yoga.

06:23.714 --> 06:25.305
You can't unsee it.

06:26.767 --> 06:29.810
Fine, then we'll stay home.

06:29.810 --> 06:32.352
But we'll also go
to the derby.

06:32.352 --> 06:34.184
Oh, no, you're using
your caper voice.

06:34.184 --> 06:35.816
I don't have a caper voice!

06:35.816 --> 06:38.358
(IN DIFFERENT VOICE)
Here's how it's all
gonna go down.

06:38.358 --> 06:40.441
We'll sneak out
and go to the derby,

06:40.441 --> 06:43.023
then we'll jump back
to right now and not go
to the derby,

06:43.023 --> 06:45.786
thereby both following
and breaking the rules.

06:45.786 --> 06:48.288
(LAUGHS WICKEDLY)

06:48.288 --> 06:51.742
Well, I guess technically
we would be obeying my mom,

06:51.742 --> 06:54.455
and we would also get to go
to the roller derby.

To become a knight,
you must complete
three rigorous challenges.

07:54.855 --> 07:58.188
First I must ask,
do you truly believe
you are worthy?

07:58.188 --> 07:59.359
BOTH: Yes.

07:59.359 --> 08:01.061
Wow, that challenge
was hard.

08:01.061 --> 08:03.564
I almost said no!

08:03.564 --> 08:05.155
Oh, that was just a question.

08:05.155 --> 08:07.317
Your first challenge
is a quest.

08:07.317 --> 08:10.240
Bret and Chet's ball went
over the neighbor's fence.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.452
It's your fault
we lost the ball, Bret.

08:12.452 --> 08:14.114
You know I can't
catch on my left.

08:14.114 --> 08:18.999
That's ridiculous.
We can't both be right-handed.

08:18.999 --> 08:22.462
You must journey
next door to retrieve
their treasured object.

08:22.462 --> 08:24.504
But that's where
Paintball Preston lives.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.547
That kid's got unlimited ammo
and he's not afraid to

08:26.547 --> 08:28.258
shoot you where the sun
don't shine.

08:28.258 --> 08:30.841

one kind of ball?

she tell us about this?

Maybe she tried
and I missed it.

unsubscribed from those notes
she puts in my lunch.

know her.

09:50.340 --> 09:52.172

A criminal record?

really her kids?

you weren't allowed.

10:07.988 --> 10:10.110
I am so disappointed.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.943
I thought you had
more respect for me
than this.

10:12.943 --> 10:14.494
That wasn't what we...
 We didn't mean to...

10:14.494 --> 10:16.997
Just go home.
We'll talk about this later.

10:16.997 --> 10:20.080

and suddenly I have some
extra aggression to work out.

The match hasn't even
started yet.

10:42.062 --> 10:44.604
I think her arm's broken!
What do we do?

10:44.604 --> 10:48.568
I got it! We'll jump back
and stop roller skates
from ever being invented.

10:48.568 --> 10:51.111
Or we'll stop my mom
from coming here
in the first place.

10:51.111 --> 10:53.113
That is way more doable.

10:54.484 --> 10:56.406
We have to warn her
about those brawlers.

10:56.406 --> 10:58.278
But we're back to
before the roller derby.

10:58.278 --> 11:00.120
They haven't
cheap-shotted her yet.

11:00.120 --> 11:01.952
(SIGHS) You're right.
She'd never believe us.

11:01.952 --> 11:04.494
And even if she did,
she'll still know
we snuck out.

11:04.494 --> 11:07.377
Just thinking about
that look she gave me
makes my eyes water

11:07.377 --> 11:09.049
and my stomach
get all queasy.

11:09.049 --> 11:11.501
Like how I feel after
all-you-can-eat
jalapeno poppers,

11:11.501 --> 11:13.093
but less gassy.

11:14.344 --> 11:17.097
Cyd, I think
you're feeling guilty.

11:17.097 --> 11:19.389
Are you sure?
Maybe I just need
to burp.

11:20.180 --> 11:20.931
(BELCHING)

11:22.062 --> 11:25.065
No. Still feel bad.

11:25.065 --> 11:28.188
You should feel bad.
I could see that belch.

11:28.188 --> 11:31.571
It's like cartoon stink lines
came out of your mouth.

11:36.366 --> 11:38.028
You have completed
your knight's quest

11:38.028 --> 11:40.120
and faced the wrath
of Paintball Preston.

11:40.120 --> 11:41.621
(SNEEZES)

11:41.621 --> 11:44.454
Oh! He shot paint
up my nose!

11:44.454 --> 11:47.327
Oh, man, he got you
in another place
the sun don't shine.

11:49.539 --> 11:52.292
For your second challenge,
you must prove your bravery.

11:52.292 --> 11:54.594
Where I come from,
that meant sword fighting

11:54.594 --> 11:56.757
till one man
was sliced like...

11:56.757 --> 11:58.178
Like...
 Bread?

11:58.178 --> 12:00.140
You guys have sliced bread?

12:00.140 --> 12:02.472
That sounds like
the best thing since
cubed badger!

12:04.104 --> 12:06.346
But since you cannot
sword fight to the death,

12:06.346 --> 12:08.608
I had to come up with
an equivalent test.

12:08.608 --> 12:13.273
I love tests.
I even look forward to
my eye exams.

12:13.273 --> 12:17.908
Within this water
are 100 bloodsucking leeches
I collected from the river.

12:17.908 --> 12:21.241
You must remove them
so that Bret and Chet
can have their evening soak.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.914
But beware, leeches go
straight for the eyes.

12:23.914 --> 12:25.826
But my eyes
are the windows
to my face!

12:28.368 --> 12:30.080
There's no shame
in backing out.

12:30.080 --> 12:31.792
Knighthood isn't for everyone.

12:31.792 --> 12:37.087
You know, like cowards,
milksops, namby-pambies.

12:37.087 --> 12:40.760
Nice try, Daisy.
We are knight enough
to handle this.

12:40.760 --> 12:45.055
(BOTH SCREAMING)

12:48.939 --> 12:52.022
Renaldo, be careful!
I had one on my face.

12:53.523 --> 12:56.526
What about me?
Do I have one on me?

12:56.526 --> 13:00.070
No, you do not
have one on you.

13:01.701 --> 13:04.574
Good, 'cause that would
really gross me out.

13:04.574 --> 13:06.246
Mmm-hmm.

13:06.246 --> 13:08.368
(BOTH CONTINUE SCREAMING)

13:15.375 --> 13:17.547
Cyd, look at her.

13:17.547 --> 13:20.340
If we don't stop my mom
from breaking her arm
at the roller derby,

13:20.340 --> 13:22.973
she won't be able to
clean the kitchen

13:22.973 --> 13:26.186
or do the laundry
or empty the dishwasher...

13:26.186 --> 13:28.188
All the things
she loves to do.

13:30.690 --> 13:33.563
Shelbs, I don't think
she loves doing
those things.

13:33.563 --> 13:36.146
Then why does she spend
all day doing them?

13:39.149 --> 13:42.202
Oh, hey, girls,
I'm just about to go
run some errands.

13:42.202 --> 13:44.284
Wait! No, no, no,
don't leave!

13:44.284 --> 13:46.246
(STUTTERS) I have to
interview you

13:46.246 --> 13:49.329
for my "woman who
inspires me most" project.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.001
Didn't you already
do that on Cyd?

13:51.001 --> 13:54.124
Dang it! Why do you
have to be so wonderful?

13:54.124 --> 13:55.835
(STAMMERS)

13:55.835 --> 13:58.008
But I was really hoping
you could whip up a batch

13:58.008 --> 14:00.300
of your famous
five-hour lasagna.

14:00.300 --> 14:02.092
Oh, Cyd, I know
how much you love it.

14:02.092 --> 14:04.724
Which is why I always
keep an extra one
in the freezer.

14:10.640 --> 14:13.063
Frozen lasagna!

14:13.063 --> 14:16.066
How could something so cold
make me feel so warm inside?

14:18.358 --> 14:19.319
(STAMMERS)
No, no.

14:19.319 --> 14:21.241
You can't leave.
(CHUCKLES)

14:21.241 --> 14:22.903
Shelby, what is going on
with you?

14:22.903 --> 14:26.076
I, um... I was wondering

14:26.076 --> 14:27.407
how you know

14:28.288 --> 14:30.911
when you've met "the one."

14:32.872 --> 14:35.545
Oh, sweetheart,
I've seen all the boys
at your school.

14:35.545 --> 14:37.127
I promise, you haven't.

14:40.210 --> 14:43.633
If we're going to save
my mom from getting hurt,
we have no choice.

14:43.633 --> 14:47.097
We gotta break the rules.
We have to sneak down
to that roller derby.

14:47.097 --> 14:50.971
And betray the trust of
the angel who made
this lasagna?

14:50.971 --> 14:53.103
There's sausage
on the bottom, Shelbs.

14:53.103 --> 14:56.106
In the shape of a heart.

15:00.070 --> 15:02.022
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

15:06.196 --> 15:09.659
There they are,
the brawlers that are
gonna hurt my mom.

15:09.659 --> 15:12.452
Have they gotten bigger
since we realized we had to
confront them?

15:14.534 --> 15:16.916
Cyd, I think it's time
to let the lasagna go.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.338
What lasagna?

15:18.338 --> 15:21.171
Oh, my gosh,
I'm still holding
this thing.

15:22.542 --> 15:24.344
Cyd, we gotta get out there
and stop them.

15:24.344 --> 15:26.676
How? We can't go
out there
without skates.

15:26.676 --> 15:29.809
I have some skate stuff
from my ninth birthday party.
Let's jump back and get it.

15:32.262 --> 15:34.224
Let's get out there
and save my mom.

15:41.321 --> 15:42.983
I forgot I can't skate.

15:45.235 --> 15:47.988
And I forgot I quit skating
because you can't skate.

15:47.988 --> 15:50.030
What do we do now?

15:50.030 --> 15:52.782
Where are you going?
 I don't know!
The skates are driving!

16:01.501 --> 16:04.004
Well done.
You've scooped up
every leech.

16:04.004 --> 16:05.925
(SCREAMS)

16:05.925 --> 16:09.009
You've scooped up
every leech.

16:09.009 --> 16:12.852
Now, for your final
knightly act, you must
demonstrate chivalry,

16:12.852 --> 16:14.304
an honorable
and polite way of

16:14.304 --> 16:16.686
putting a fair maiden's needs
ahead of your own.

16:16.686 --> 16:19.599
Oh, that's what
chivalry means.

16:19.599 --> 16:22.442
I already knew,
but I'm putting her needs
ahead of my own.

16:24.064 --> 16:25.775
So, where are these
fair maidens?

16:28.318 --> 16:29.739
I'm Fair-skin.

16:29.739 --> 16:31.241
And I'm Maiden Portland.

16:33.203 --> 16:35.915
You must carry them to
the tub so their feet
don't get soiled.

16:35.915 --> 16:37.997
No, forget it.
I am not doing that.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.249
(SIGHS) That's okay.

16:39.249 --> 16:41.331
Being a knight
is not for everyone.

16:41.331 --> 16:44.464
Maybe you should just
go back to your little
prank war.

16:44.464 --> 16:46.506
(COUGHING) Namby-pambies!

16:46.506 --> 16:48.298
Oh, no, Princess.
Warm up your dubbing hand,

16:48.298 --> 16:51.010
'cause you're about to make
yourself a couple of
fresh knights.

16:52.132 --> 16:54.264
Hop on, Bret.

16:58.398 --> 17:00.810
I get motion sickness.

17:00.810 --> 17:02.692
Carry me like a koala.

17:04.354 --> 17:06.445
Renaldo, I want to switch.

17:07.446 --> 17:08.907
I would, Barry,
but I'm done.

17:15.325 --> 17:18.078
Aw, nuts! I forgot my novel!

17:18.078 --> 17:19.499
(GROANS)

17:29.509 --> 17:31.801
I can't believe

17:31.801 --> 17:35.135
how many things he forgot.

17:40.480 --> 17:42.562
(ALL CHEERING)

17:42.562 --> 17:44.394
Okay, so the skates
were a bad idea.

17:46.776 --> 17:48.528
We have to do something.

17:48.528 --> 17:51.451
We can't let my mom get hurt.
We have to warn her.

17:51.451 --> 17:54.244
But then she'll know
we came here even though
she told us not to!

17:54.244 --> 17:56.456
She'll be disappointed
in us all over again.

17:56.456 --> 17:58.288
(WHISTLE BLOWING)

18:07.627 --> 18:09.839
They're going for my mom.
(STUTTERS) I'm just
gonna tell her.

18:09.839 --> 18:12.262
Shelbs, wait,
I know what to do.

18:38.998 --> 18:41.701
I always said your mom
made a killer lasagna.

18:43.543 --> 18:46.085
Cyd, that was a great line!
Did you just think of that?

18:46.085 --> 18:49.509
Yes! I just opened my mouth
and there it was!

18:49.509 --> 18:51.461
Come on, we gotta get
out of here before
your mom sees us.

18:55.965 --> 18:57.427
(FANFARE PLAYING)

19:00.019 --> 19:04.474
Barry, Naldo, you have
proven yourselves
knight-worthy.

19:04.474 --> 19:07.357
(BOTH PANTING)

19:07.357 --> 19:09.529
We did it. This whole day
has been torture,

19:09.529 --> 19:11.321
but it's gonna be
so worth it

19:11.321 --> 19:15.655
when I casually
drop my title into
every conversation.

19:15.655 --> 19:19.699
I know. Usually when people
call me sir, it's like,
"You forgot this, sir"

19:19.699 --> 19:21.281
or "Sir, are you lost?"

19:21.281 --> 19:23.623
Or "You can't bring
a ferret into
the theater, sir!"

19:25.205 --> 19:27.497
But all that's about
to change.

19:29.048 --> 19:30.169
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

19:30.169 --> 19:32.001
Please kneel to be knighted.

19:32.001 --> 19:34.344
(BOTH BREATHING DEEPLY)

19:34.344 --> 19:35.675
(FART NOISE)

19:35.675 --> 19:39.639
(LAUGHING)

19:41.261 --> 19:42.892
Is this a part of
the ceremony?

19:46.606 --> 19:50.480
No, Renaldo.
I think she just
pranked us.

19:50.480 --> 19:52.612
Not bad for a princess.

19:52.612 --> 19:56.316
So all of this was just
to prove that you could
prank as well as us?

19:56.316 --> 19:59.449
No. It was to prove
I could prank better
than you.

20:01.321 --> 20:04.824
I'm confused.
Are we knights or not?

20:04.824 --> 20:07.587
Sorry, Naldo.
I can't actually
knight people.

20:07.587 --> 20:11.090
But you two
were such great sports.
Truce?

20:11.090 --> 20:12.502
(BUZZING)
 (GROANING)

20:13.503 --> 20:15.295
(LAUGHING) You fell for it!

20:15.295 --> 20:17.387
It's your joke
and you fell for it!

20:17.387 --> 20:19.759
(LAUGHING)

20:19.759 --> 20:21.431
Fare thee well, jesters!

20:24.684 --> 20:28.438
I'm not sure if I hate her
or I'm in love with her.

20:29.849 --> 20:32.402
That's the greatest
prank of all.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.360
C'mon, we gotta make it
look like we've been here
all night.

20:40.360 --> 20:43.453
Quick, Cyd, fall asleep
on your homework!

20:43.453 --> 20:46.205
I don't understand.
Your mom didn't
catch us this time.

20:46.205 --> 20:47.627
Why do I still feel guilty?

20:48.368 --> 20:49.869
You shouldn't.

20:49.869 --> 20:53.172
We did the right thing.
And we got away with it.

20:53.172 --> 20:55.465
Hey, girls.
How was your evening?

20:55.465 --> 20:57.677
Fine. We didn't disobey you.

20:57.677 --> 21:00.510
What?
 Stop looking at me like that,
we didn't lie to your face!

21:01.801 --> 21:03.803
Cyd, sweetheart,
is something wrong?

21:04.804 --> 21:08.558
Yeah. Um, we went
to the roller derby

21:08.558 --> 21:11.771
even though we knew
you wouldn't want us to.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.523
What were you two
doing at the derby?

21:13.523 --> 21:15.855
Oh, we could ask you
the same thing,
young lady!

21:15.855 --> 21:17.317
You really want to
go there right now?

21:17.317 --> 21:18.318
No, I do not.

21:20.029 --> 21:22.362
I thought I wouldn't feel
guilty about breaking
the rules

21:22.362 --> 21:25.114
because my mom's not here.

21:25.114 --> 21:27.957
But I do feel guilty.

21:27.957 --> 21:30.870
And I think it's because
I kinda do have a mom here.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.674
I... I disappointed you,
Astrid.

21:34.674 --> 21:38.007
And I'm so sorry.

21:38.007 --> 21:39.298
Oh, Cyd.

21:40.009 --> 21:41.921
I'm sorry too.

21:41.921 --> 21:46.185
But why didn't you
ever tell us
you did roller derby?

21:46.185 --> 21:48.888
I guess I thought
it might freak you out.

21:48.888 --> 21:53.393
(CHUCKLING) Oh, it did.
At first, I was like,
"That's my mom?"

21:53.393 --> 21:56.566
But then I was like,
"That's my mom."

21:57.607 --> 22:00.360
You were amazing out there.

22:00.360 --> 22:02.902
I should have known
my kids would support me.

22:03.653 --> 22:05.284
All of them.

22:07.116 --> 22:09.078
Also, you're grounded
for sneaking out.

22:09.078 --> 22:10.580
And she's back.

22:21.381 --> 22:22.802
Good throw, Chet.

22:22.802 --> 22:24.764
Our ball went into
Preston's yard again.

22:24.764 --> 22:27.266
Well, only one thing
we can do now.

22:31.230 --> 22:33.433
Should we have told Barry
and Naldo that we had these?

22:33.433 --> 22:35.565
No, they would have been
mad at us after getting hit

22:35.565 --> 22:37.186
with all those paint balls.

22:37.186 --> 22:39.569
I mean before they went
over the fence.

22:39.569 --> 22:41.401
Oh!

22:42.321 --> 22:43.242
Probably.
