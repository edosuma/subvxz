01:11.838 --> 01:13.030
- Hello, America.

01:13.030 --> 01:15.900
As you probably already know,
a deadly virus was unleashed

01:15.900 --> 01:17.980
onto the United States last week,

01:17.980 --> 01:21.340
and it was successfully
quarantined until tonight.

01:21.340 --> 01:24.810
Within the next 72 hours,
every man, woman and child

01:24.810 --> 01:27.810
will either be dead or infected.

01:27.810 --> 01:28.693
Why, you ask?

01:29.600 --> 01:32.780
You pathetic little people
live your mundane lives.

01:32.780 --> 01:34.720
You wake up in the morning
and you drink your coffee

01:34.720 --> 01:35.857
and you go to work,

01:35.857 --> 01:38.220
but what you fail to realize

01:38.220 --> 01:40.910
is that you are nothing
but ants in a farm,

01:40.910 --> 01:44.050
and ants don't matter,
because all it takes

01:44.050 --> 01:47.833
is one little parasite for
your entire colony to fall.

02:20.035 --> 02:20.990
It's time to wake up.

02:20.990 --> 02:22.460
Pay attention!

02:22.460 --> 02:24.400
We are the new threat!

02:24.400 --> 02:25.997
We're the ones that are responsible

02:25.997 --> 02:27.810
for the plague that the city deserves.

02:27.810 --> 02:30.027
We are The Reaper.

03:41.041 --> 03:42.958
- Hey, you good?
- Yeah.

03:43.812 --> 03:45.039
- What happened?

03:45.039 --> 03:46.995
- Shit was crazy.

03:46.995 --> 03:49.880
- You turn into
one just like that, look.

03:49.880 --> 03:50.795
- Tell 'em.

03:50.795 --> 03:52.212
- Hello, America.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.152
- I need to get out of here.

03:57.152 --> 04:00.370
- Where the hell are you going?

04:00.370 --> 04:01.870
Where the hell are you going?

04:01.870 --> 04:03.140
- This isn't what we planned.

04:03.140 --> 04:04.350
I thought we were raising it to.

04:04.350 --> 04:06.910
- Plans change, man, we woke up.

04:06.910 --> 04:07.987
- Are you fucking kidding me?

04:07.987 --> 04:08.980
- Are you kidding?

04:08.980 --> 04:10.506
Sit down!

04:10.506 --> 04:11.468
- Fuck this shit, let's just go, come on.

04:11.468 --> 04:13.353
- Ah ah, go.
- Sit down, get on.

04:13.353 --> 04:14.440
- Get on with it, get on with it.

04:14.440 --> 04:15.670
What the fuck are you gonna cut me?

04:15.670 --> 04:17.214
- Yeah, I'm gonna cut you bitch.

04:17.214 --> 04:18.269
- Sit down!
- Are you kidding me?

04:18.269 --> 04:19.468
- Sit down!
- What are you gonna do?

04:19.468 --> 04:20.713
What are you gonna do?
- I'm sick of you.

04:20.713 --> 04:22.532
- What the fuck?
- Get outta here.

04:22.532 --> 04:23.365
- Get the fuck off him!

04:23.365 --> 04:24.497
Come on get off him!

04:26.153 --> 04:29.433
Get that fucking gun out of our face.

04:29.433 --> 04:30.266
- Down!

04:32.514 --> 04:33.833
- We did it baby.

04:33.833 --> 04:34.836
Baby.

04:43.716 --> 04:46.883
- Wait, what's going on, dude.

04:48.068 --> 04:50.750
You've got blood in your mouth, idiots!

04:50.750 --> 04:52.667
Stop, this ain't funny!

04:54.143 --> 04:55.988
- They have the goddamn virus!

05:19.550 --> 05:22.217
- Grab the goddamn gun, come on.

06:15.632 --> 06:16.836
- Okay, this thing on?

06:16.836 --> 06:17.876
Cool, alright.

06:17.876 --> 06:19.250
Hi, mom and dad.

06:19.250 --> 06:20.473
- Hey, Jan.

06:20.473 --> 06:21.853
- And we just wanted to thank you,

06:21.853 --> 06:23.150
finally did it.

06:23.150 --> 06:25.257
We got our new car.

06:25.257 --> 06:26.353
- We got it.

06:26.353 --> 06:27.970
- We just got home from the dealership.

06:27.970 --> 06:29.290
We finally did it

06:29.290 --> 06:31.660
and now, you can ride
in it when you come out

06:31.660 --> 06:33.177
to visit us.

06:33.177 --> 06:34.175
Which we're very excited about, right?

06:34.175 --> 06:35.612
- Hell, yeah.
- Right, right.

06:35.612 --> 06:36.616
- I'm really excited.

06:36.616 --> 06:38.116
Its gonna be good to see you guys.

06:38.116 --> 06:38.949
- No, its gonna be great.

06:38.949 --> 06:39.782
So I just want to share that with you

06:39.782 --> 06:41.600
and I hope you all are doing okay.

06:41.600 --> 06:42.433
- Yo, Lauren.

06:42.433 --> 06:43.946
Look at this fucking bitch.

06:43.946 --> 06:44.779
- What?

06:44.779 --> 06:45.680
Don't say that.

06:45.680 --> 06:46.940
- This is not a drill.

06:46.940 --> 06:50.060
I repeat.
- What is she doing?

06:50.060 --> 06:52.010
- She fucking drunk or some shit?

06:54.170 --> 06:55.162
- Instructions are given.

06:55.162 --> 06:57.750
FDA has declared an outbreak.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.440
- She's fucking bare feet.

06:59.440 --> 07:00.990
- This is a national...

07:03.444 --> 07:05.820
- Bro, is this thing on?

07:05.820 --> 07:06.653
- Yeah, yeah.

07:06.653 --> 07:08.320
If you got the light right there.

07:08.320 --> 07:09.153
- Where?

07:09.153 --> 07:10.810
- Right there.

07:10.810 --> 07:12.724
- Oh so this means its on.

07:12.724 --> 07:13.883
- What the fuck else would it mean?

07:15.080 --> 07:16.110
I didn't do anything.

07:16.110 --> 07:17.583
- No he's right.

07:17.583 --> 07:20.623
Like its the first time
I've ever used a camera.

07:20.623 --> 07:21.780
- You're good man, you're good.

07:21.780 --> 07:22.613
- Aright.

07:22.613 --> 07:23.446
Sorry, I'm just like.

07:23.446 --> 07:24.985
I'm just really nervous you guys.

07:24.985 --> 07:25.818
- Do you want me to hold it for you?

07:25.818 --> 07:27.247
- Yeah, if you don't mind.

07:27.247 --> 07:28.080
Do you mind?
- Of course, man.

07:28.080 --> 07:28.913
- Alright.

07:28.913 --> 07:30.140
- Dude, you got this.

07:30.140 --> 07:31.240
- I got this, alright.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.093
Julia, alright.

07:37.802 --> 07:39.540
This is harder than it looks.

07:39.540 --> 07:40.373
Alright, guys.

07:41.920 --> 07:44.890
Julia, I've been wanting
to make this video for you

07:44.890 --> 07:47.640
so we could always remember
how special this night was.

07:49.979 --> 07:51.350
You're gonna be home soon and

07:53.247 --> 07:54.953
well when you walk through those doors,

07:57.129 --> 07:58.883
I'm gonna ask you to marry me.

08:01.440 --> 08:02.870
I love you so much, honey

08:04.244 --> 08:05.640
and I just want us both
to be able to remember

08:05.640 --> 08:07.640
this night forever, cause
this is the first night.

08:07.640 --> 08:09.190
I mean this is the night where,

08:11.364 --> 08:13.783
the start of our family together.

08:16.270 --> 08:18.220
The last three years with you have been

08:19.490 --> 08:21.305
well they've been perfect

08:21.305 --> 08:22.670
and I want to continue that
perfection for the rest

08:22.670 --> 08:23.550
of our lives

08:24.490 --> 08:26.150
and to help us celebrate,

08:26.150 --> 08:27.500
I've invited our best friends,

08:27.500 --> 08:28.380
Eisley and Cameron.

08:28.380 --> 08:29.865
Say hi, guys.

08:29.865 --> 08:30.948
- Hey.

08:32.370 --> 08:34.590
- So we're here to make your
night absolutely special

08:34.590 --> 08:36.360
and I want it to be magical and perfect

08:36.360 --> 08:38.592
cause you're perfect to me.

08:40.289 --> 08:42.500
Well we've been preparing
a bunch of stuff for you.

08:45.100 --> 08:46.600
- Did she get off work already?

08:46.600 --> 08:47.967
- I don't know.

08:47.967 --> 08:49.967
We should of had at least
15 to 20 minutes to prepare.

08:49.967 --> 08:50.964
- Doesn't matter.

08:50.964 --> 08:51.972
Let me just turn off the stove

08:51.972 --> 08:52.985
cause I don't want to miss this.

08:52.985 --> 08:54.547
- Yeah, let's do this.

08:54.547 --> 08:55.545
- So excited.

08:55.545 --> 08:56.378
- You got the camera?

08:56.378 --> 08:58.681
- Dude, you got this.

08:58.681 --> 08:59.710
- Thank you so much, you guys, seriously,

08:59.710 --> 09:01.760
like I couldn't of done this without you.

09:02.623 --> 09:03.625
Thanks.

09:03.625 --> 09:06.201
- Alright.
- Alright, let's do it.

09:06.201 --> 09:07.034
- This is it.

09:07.034 --> 09:08.073
Let's hope I don't mess
it up or something.

09:12.500 --> 09:13.333
Hi, honey.

09:14.380 --> 09:15.213
You okay?

09:16.630 --> 09:18.860
Well, I'm just so glad you're here early

09:18.860 --> 09:20.827
cause there's something really important

09:20.827 --> 09:22.407
I want to ask you and.

09:23.972 --> 09:25.030
You know what, I'm just so nervous,

09:25.030 --> 09:26.133
I'm going for it.

09:30.630 --> 09:32.483
- Did you hear that?

09:33.370 --> 09:35.151
- What's going on outside?

09:35.151 --> 09:36.401
- I don't know.

09:37.290 --> 09:39.313
- It sounds like its
coming from down the street.

09:44.648 --> 09:48.105
- What are you doing?

09:48.105 --> 09:49.772
- Oh fuck.

09:51.321 --> 09:52.963
Oh shit.

10:05.400 --> 10:06.740
- Oh, thank god.

10:06.740 --> 10:09.130
Hey, is everything okay?

10:09.130 --> 10:09.980
What's it like there?

10:09.980 --> 10:10.890
Are you okay?

10:10.890 --> 10:12.361
- What?

10:12.361 --> 10:13.194
Yeah, I'm okay.

10:13.194 --> 10:14.027
Wait, wait.

10:14.027 --> 10:14.979
Slow down, what the hell's going on?

10:14.979 --> 10:15.977
- I don't know.

10:15.977 --> 10:16.810
Nobody knows.

10:16.810 --> 10:20.200
The National Guard is
rolling through the streets.

10:20.200 --> 10:21.950
Its fucking crazy.

10:21.950 --> 10:23.140
- Goddamn rioters.

10:23.140 --> 10:24.440
Do you know what part of town they're in?

10:24.440 --> 10:25.273
Are they near you?

10:25.273 --> 10:27.839
- Honey, its not rioting.

10:27.839 --> 10:29.573
Do you not know what's going on?

10:30.740 --> 10:32.970
- I'm in a jungle in the middle of Myanmar

10:32.970 --> 10:34.830
and my internet connection
is out of my MiFi

10:34.830 --> 10:35.920
which is spotty at best.

10:35.920 --> 10:37.090
So you tell me.

10:37.090 --> 10:39.580
- Some sort of outbreak.

10:39.580 --> 10:42.700
They have us on 24 mandatory curfew.

10:42.700 --> 10:44.770
People are locked up in their houses,

10:44.770 --> 10:45.670
its martial law.

10:45.670 --> 10:46.503
- What?

10:46.503 --> 10:48.499
Wait, outbreak, what?

10:48.499 --> 10:49.737
- Yeah, its like.

10:49.737 --> 10:51.580
Some disease, I don't know.

10:51.580 --> 10:52.560
Its like rabies.

10:52.560 --> 10:53.880
People are acting crazy.

10:53.880 --> 10:56.440
The TV is just the
emergency broadcast system

10:56.440 --> 10:58.810
telling everyone to stay inside.

10:58.810 --> 10:59.643
- What the fuck?

10:59.643 --> 11:01.290
Wait, are you okay?

11:01.290 --> 11:03.160
Did they say how long that
you have to stay inside?

11:03.160 --> 11:04.270
- I am fine.

11:04.270 --> 11:05.140
I don't know how long.

11:05.140 --> 11:08.810
I've got plenty of food for a few days.

11:08.810 --> 11:09.643
I'll be fine.

11:09.643 --> 11:10.950
- A few days?

11:10.950 --> 11:11.940
That is crazy.

11:11.940 --> 11:14.880
Where is the CDC where is.

11:14.880 --> 11:16.970
- I don't, I don't know.

11:16.970 --> 11:17.803
I don't know.

11:17.803 --> 11:18.740
I'm getting all of my information

11:18.740 --> 11:20.650
from shit that people
are uploading online.

11:20.650 --> 11:21.940
That's all...

11:21.940 --> 11:23.573
The networks come back.

11:23.573 --> 11:24.406
I...

11:25.440 --> 11:27.017
Send you links if you want

11:27.017 --> 11:28.317
and so we can figure this.

11:29.260 --> 11:30.590
Honey?

11:30.590 --> 11:31.936
Oh shit.

11:31.936 --> 11:33.417
Stephanie.

17:55.343 --> 17:56.840
- They just went downstairs.

17:56.840 --> 17:58.310
I don't have that much time.

17:58.310 --> 17:59.680
You're not, you're not
answering your phone.

17:59.680 --> 18:00.513
I can't send this to you.

18:00.513 --> 18:01.420
I'm just gonna record this

18:01.420 --> 18:03.242
and hope that somebody gets it.

18:03.242 --> 18:04.780
We need to figure out what's going on.

18:04.780 --> 18:05.630
If we're gonna have any chance.

18:05.630 --> 18:10.090
I saw students, they infected
within three minutes.

18:10.090 --> 18:11.740
Three minutes is all there is

18:11.740 --> 18:13.960
and I can't explain how that can happen

18:13.960 --> 18:15.900
but look, okay.

18:15.900 --> 18:18.680
So the problem is a bite, right?

18:18.680 --> 18:20.600
All of a sudden changes brain chemistry.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.980
I refuse to believe that these are dead,

18:22.980 --> 18:24.230
you know they fall down,

18:24.230 --> 18:26.550
but I don't think we're talking
about reanimated corpses,

18:26.550 --> 18:27.383
that doesn't make any sense.

18:27.383 --> 18:28.682
What we're talking about

18:28.682 --> 18:30.630
it seems like a diseases,
it changes behavior

18:30.630 --> 18:32.120
in really horrible ways.

18:32.120 --> 18:34.040
Quickly, within three
minutes, three minutes.

18:34.040 --> 18:35.710
We don't have an answer for that

18:35.710 --> 18:37.500
but here has to be the mechanism

18:37.500 --> 18:39.490
for blood to change the brain.

18:39.490 --> 18:40.323
How does that work?

18:40.323 --> 18:41.850
We got the blood brain barrier, right?

18:41.850 --> 18:44.460
We also have the blood and
cerebral spinal fluid barrier.

18:44.460 --> 18:45.293
Two different places.

18:45.293 --> 18:46.440
We have endothelioid cells

18:46.440 --> 18:48.760
that make it so the things
don't penetrate the brain

18:48.760 --> 18:50.670
and here the chorolplexus,

18:50.670 --> 18:52.214
we have a variety of
ways in which the fluids

18:52.214 --> 18:53.230
are separated.

18:53.230 --> 18:55.510
So what do we do with those elements?

18:55.510 --> 18:58.270
How do we talk about diseases that change,

18:58.270 --> 18:59.400
we're talking about blood and brain.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.960
We have to make sure that
something can go through

19:01.960 --> 19:04.770
the bloodstream and end up in the...

19:04.770 --> 19:05.670
Did you hear that?

19:07.760 --> 19:08.593
I have to go faster.

19:08.593 --> 19:09.950
Something has to be able
to cross this barrier.

19:09.950 --> 19:12.340
So we have, you know,
non-communicable diseases

19:12.340 --> 19:13.790
but what matters are
communicable diseases.

19:13.790 --> 19:15.550
The things that we know
that do this a lot.

19:15.550 --> 19:16.796
Things like Parkinson,
things like Alzheimer's,

19:16.796 --> 19:18.440
epilepsy, multiple sclerosis.

19:18.440 --> 19:20.838
Things that have various
interactions in these things.

19:20.838 --> 19:23.150
It can't be that everybody has a secret

19:23.150 --> 19:24.230
form of multiple sclerosis,

19:24.230 --> 19:25.860
that's engaged in three minutes by a bite,

19:25.860 --> 19:26.693
that doesn't make any sense

19:26.693 --> 19:28.320
or any of those kind of things.

19:28.320 --> 19:29.230
So we're talking communicable diseases

19:29.230 --> 19:31.310
that can pass across these barriers

19:31.310 --> 19:32.143
and there's a variety.

19:32.143 --> 19:33.420
One is an abcess, right of course,

19:33.420 --> 19:35.330
if I get a tooth swelling and it,

19:35.330 --> 19:37.560
but that takes too long
for an infection to spread,

19:37.560 --> 19:38.410
we're talking weeks.

19:38.410 --> 19:40.440
HIV based encyopyelitis is something else

19:40.440 --> 19:41.350
but that's something where,

19:41.350 --> 19:44.000
interesting, the HIV it puts
these sort of mono phages

19:44.000 --> 19:45.760
up there and they
activate at a certain time

19:45.760 --> 19:46.940
when the immune system is suppressed.

19:46.940 --> 19:48.030
So that's useful.

19:48.030 --> 19:49.210
So remember this.

19:49.210 --> 19:50.043
This idea.

19:50.043 --> 19:51.640
So when we're talking about the HIV,

19:51.640 --> 19:53.760
its not HIV but the mechanism

19:53.760 --> 19:56.080
is that it sort of hides
almost like this Trojan horse,

19:56.080 --> 19:57.610
right that's the phrase in the brain

19:57.610 --> 19:58.680
activates later.

19:58.680 --> 20:00.220
That's the only explanation
for how that could

20:00.220 --> 20:01.053
happen so quickly.

20:01.053 --> 20:02.950
Is something is in the brain already

20:02.950 --> 20:04.270
that becomes activated quickly

20:04.270 --> 20:05.770
from the time it takes from the blood

20:05.770 --> 20:07.158
to cross the barrier in there and activate

20:07.158 --> 20:09.240
and it changes something really quickly.

20:09.240 --> 20:10.599
So what else are we talking about?

20:10.599 --> 20:11.797
We're talking about meningitis.

20:11.797 --> 20:14.373
Meningitis, of course it takes too long.

20:15.702 --> 20:16.535
Its not something that rabies,

20:16.535 --> 20:18.410
which doesn't work,
again, too long as well.

20:18.410 --> 20:19.810
So what do we...

20:19.810 --> 20:21.080
We have to find something

20:21.080 --> 20:23.600
that explains how this works.

20:23.600 --> 20:24.690
I usually thought of,

20:24.690 --> 20:26.360
trypanosomiasis, right?

20:26.360 --> 20:28.340
Sleeping sickness, which makes sense

20:28.340 --> 20:30.820
because it causes sort of
sleep and behavior changes

20:30.820 --> 20:31.653
and all kinds of things.

20:31.653 --> 20:32.870
Explain some of this violence

20:32.870 --> 20:33.703
and things like that.

20:33.703 --> 20:34.820
Much better than something like rabies

20:34.820 --> 20:36.720
which doesn't work in terms of humans.

20:42.284 --> 20:43.382
- Right, look at today, okay?

20:43.382 --> 20:46.520
I have known people
make thousands of pounds

20:46.520 --> 20:47.887
just doing this shit.

20:50.060 --> 20:51.404
- I can't do this.

20:51.404 --> 20:53.330
- What do you mean you can't do it now?

20:53.330 --> 20:54.480
You're committed, love.

20:55.974 --> 20:57.930
- I don't think I can do this, Mark.

20:57.930 --> 21:00.040
Isn't there any easier way to make money?

21:02.280 --> 21:04.614
- You told me that you
wanted to make quick

21:04.614 --> 21:08.040
and easy money that would be
in your bank account tonight

21:08.040 --> 21:09.820
and besides which, you
said that you weren't doing

21:09.820 --> 21:12.370
this for yourself but you're
doing it for your boy.

21:14.860 --> 21:16.550
- Yeah, of course.

21:16.550 --> 21:18.040
- Right.

21:18.040 --> 21:19.990
Then we're ready to go.

21:19.990 --> 21:23.470
When I cue, to feck.

21:24.370 --> 21:27.030
Just put on a show and make ourselves

21:27.030 --> 21:28.333
some fucking money!

21:41.916 --> 21:43.798
You type on there.

21:43.798 --> 21:45.298
You tip, I stream.

22:02.556 --> 22:04.075
right, listen up here.

22:04.075 --> 22:07.075
Mikey99 has just left a big big tip.

22:08.194 --> 22:09.027
Come on.

22:42.443 --> 22:43.890
Jay?

23:01.554 --> 23:03.550
Oh fuck me, fuck me, fuck me.

23:03.550 --> 23:04.994
He's dead.

23:04.994 --> 23:06.135
Fuck off, fuck.

23:07.120 --> 23:07.953
Jesus.

23:13.698 --> 23:15.948
Get out of the fucking way.

23:43.474 --> 23:48.474
- Help me!

24:27.055 --> 24:28.100
- Can't get to the fucking car keys.

24:28.100 --> 24:29.695
- You left me.

24:29.695 --> 24:30.692
- So?

24:30.692 --> 24:31.913
I need to get out of here, okay.

24:31.913 --> 24:35.332
Car keys, have you got em?

24:35.332 --> 24:36.393
Great.

24:36.393 --> 24:37.851
The fucking thing still on.

24:43.809 --> 24:44.807
Fuck.

24:44.807 --> 24:45.983
Fucking cunt!

24:45.983 --> 24:46.816
Oh fuck.

24:58.505 --> 25:00.672
- Enjoy the show, fuckers.

25:04.454 --> 25:06.537
- Don't fucking leave me.

25:09.471 --> 25:13.311
- I'm a woman, I'm not allowed to think.

25:28.393 --> 25:29.609
- No!

25:46.900 --> 25:48.550
- Oh hey guys.

25:48.550 --> 25:49.951
Chauncey Phillips here.

25:49.951 --> 25:52.911
I thought I would do a video
checking in with you guys

25:52.911 --> 25:56.290
you know as you know, there are things

25:56.290 --> 25:57.757
have pretty much gone to shit out there.

25:57.757 --> 26:00.390
You know, I'm sure you're
all dealing with it as well.

26:00.390 --> 26:02.610
I mean, as far as I know, its everywhere.

26:02.610 --> 26:04.560
Is a zombie outbreak going on.

26:04.560 --> 26:06.280
You know me, I've always been a horror fan

26:06.280 --> 26:07.670
and I even talked in the past,

26:07.670 --> 26:08.850
like I wonder what it would be like

26:08.850 --> 26:10.410
and where I would go

26:10.410 --> 26:13.140
if a zombie outbreak
happened or things like that

26:13.140 --> 26:14.873
and well, I pretty much decided

26:14.873 --> 26:17.180
just to lock myself in the DVD room.

26:17.180 --> 26:20.593
You know it has a really
pretty good strong door.

26:21.520 --> 26:23.490
You know most people don't
even know its in here.

26:23.490 --> 26:24.810
Its hidden away.

26:24.810 --> 26:26.420
Its not like something
that people are gonna go.

26:26.420 --> 26:27.960
People are gonna break into this house,

26:27.960 --> 26:29.440
they're not gonna think
to come into this room.

26:29.440 --> 26:31.800
This is a pretty secret private place

26:31.800 --> 26:34.930
and I figured this is a good
place to hide myself away.

26:34.930 --> 26:36.190
You know I've taken out some water,

26:36.190 --> 26:38.090
I've taken some crackers
and things like that with me

26:38.090 --> 26:40.648
but I got some, I got enough stuff.

26:40.648 --> 26:42.370
You don't know how long
I'm gonna be in here

26:42.370 --> 26:43.689
and I'm not really expecting,

26:43.689 --> 26:45.250
you know in Zombie outbreaks,

26:45.250 --> 26:46.760
people don't usually live too long

26:46.760 --> 26:48.190
and I mean I don't know

26:48.190 --> 26:50.240
if I'm gonna be in here for a long time.

26:50.240 --> 26:51.663
I don't know if anything, you know,

26:51.663 --> 26:53.790
another day someone's
gonna bust down this door

26:53.790 --> 26:55.050
and come out here and eat me.

26:55.050 --> 26:56.310
I have no idea

26:56.310 --> 26:57.960
but you know, I don't even really know why

26:57.960 --> 27:00.110
I'm bothering to do these videos

27:00.110 --> 27:01.970
or why I'm even bothering
to update you on this

27:01.970 --> 27:03.880
because I know you're all
stuck in this situation,

27:03.880 --> 27:05.230
as far as I know.

27:05.230 --> 27:07.170
But I figured, this is what I do.

27:07.170 --> 27:09.620
I'm a video blogger, I
do these kind videos,

27:09.620 --> 27:10.680
I do this kind of stuff.

27:10.680 --> 27:13.900
So why not be one of the
few people out there,

27:13.900 --> 27:15.490
you know, who knows how many
other people are doing this

27:15.490 --> 27:18.380
but be one of the people out
here who's talking about it

27:18.380 --> 27:20.468
and you know, giving you guys updates.

27:20.468 --> 27:23.110
Every so often as I get time,

27:23.110 --> 27:25.150
I'm gonna give you updates
on what's going on,

27:25.150 --> 27:26.770
although I'm pretty
much just stuck in here

27:26.770 --> 27:28.470
and not really doing much

27:28.470 --> 27:30.223
but you know, like I said.

27:30.223 --> 27:33.000
You know, its zombie outbreak

27:33.000 --> 27:35.960
and I'm actually experiencing it

27:35.960 --> 27:37.870
and I'm in my DVD room.

27:37.870 --> 27:39.330
So at least if I do die,

27:39.330 --> 27:40.930
I'm around the things that I love,

27:40.930 --> 27:42.210
the things that I like

27:42.210 --> 27:44.133
so its not gonna be that terrible.

27:44.133 --> 27:47.200
I do wish there was somebody
else in here with me,

27:47.200 --> 27:48.430
preferably a woman or something

27:48.430 --> 27:51.270
but you know, I mean I don't know.

27:51.270 --> 27:53.160
But I'll give ya updates.

27:53.160 --> 27:54.940
Let you guys know how I'm doing.

27:54.940 --> 27:57.160
Hope some of you guys
out there are still alive

27:57.160 --> 27:59.240
and you know hopefully some of you guys

27:59.240 --> 28:00.560
are able to watch this.

28:00.560 --> 28:02.625
So I'll see you guys later.

28:02.625 --> 28:03.458
Bye.

28:11.610 --> 28:13.603
- My name is Mark Stevens.

28:17.270 --> 28:18.103
I'm...

28:21.110 --> 28:22.433
Gonna die.

28:27.270 --> 28:28.803
Some day, I guess.

28:32.870 --> 28:33.703
But I...

28:41.390 --> 28:45.480
I want to tell you the facts that I know.

28:48.388 --> 28:49.721
Fact number one.

28:52.040 --> 28:54.073
Laura's not okay.

28:57.720 --> 29:00.230
She got scratched three days ago

29:02.504 --> 29:04.160
and since then,

29:04.160 --> 29:09.160
she hasn't stopped moaning
until this very moment.

29:11.910 --> 29:14.663
She's been quiet for about 30 minutes.

29:16.670 --> 29:20.557
Its the first time she's
been quiet in three days.

29:23.060 --> 29:25.373
I'm sitting outside her room.

29:27.849 --> 29:29.682
I tied her to the bed.

29:38.260 --> 29:39.570
- Really, Jimmy with that cellphone?

29:39.570 --> 29:40.590
Come on, I'm feeling fat.

29:40.590 --> 29:41.423
- Oh you're not fat.

29:41.423 --> 29:43.028
You look beautiful.

29:43.028 --> 29:43.861
- I'm a balloon.

29:43.861 --> 29:46.680
- You are a beautiful balloon

29:46.680 --> 29:48.570
with my beautiful balloon baby.

29:48.570 --> 29:49.560
Yes you are.

29:49.560 --> 29:51.046
- Really?

29:51.046 --> 29:52.044
I complain to you that I'm feeling fat

29:52.044 --> 29:52.877
and you put the camera on my belly?

29:52.877 --> 29:54.047
Really?
- Come on.

29:54.047 --> 29:56.323
Stop being so insecure.

29:57.689 --> 29:58.564
- What was that?

29:58.564 --> 29:59.705
- I don't um.

29:59.705 --> 30:00.538
I don't know.

30:01.609 --> 30:03.231
okay, lets um.

30:03.231 --> 30:04.228
Let's.

30:04.228 --> 30:05.572
Yeah, let's get out of here.

30:05.572 --> 30:06.905
- What was that?

30:10.089 --> 30:13.253
- Alright, so all hell broke loose.

30:14.370 --> 30:17.900
Fucking dead people are
coming back to life.

30:17.900 --> 30:20.650
I didn't think dead people
could come back to life but.

30:23.010 --> 30:23.960
The hell do I know?

30:26.086 --> 30:27.483
This fucking thing.

30:27.483 --> 30:28.704
- Come here, we have to go.
- What?

30:28.704 --> 30:29.709
- We have to go now.

30:29.709 --> 30:30.600
- What, what are you talking about?

30:30.600 --> 30:31.433
- Come on.

30:31.433 --> 30:32.708
Pick it up.

30:32.708 --> 30:33.711
Let's get to the car, let's go.

30:33.711 --> 30:34.544
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

30:34.544 --> 30:35.377
Come on, thank you.

30:35.377 --> 30:36.210
Come on.

30:37.310 --> 30:38.210
- Shit.

30:38.210 --> 30:39.240
I think I should bring this.

30:39.240 --> 30:40.645
Should I?

30:40.645 --> 30:41.478
- What?

30:41.478 --> 30:42.311
- An ax.
- What do you need that for?

30:42.311 --> 30:43.144
Why are you filming?

30:43.144 --> 30:44.600
- We don't have a gun

30:44.600 --> 30:46.692
cause you didn't want to
buy a fucking gun last time

30:46.692 --> 30:49.763
and I'm filming cause I
want to get this on camera.

30:53.650 --> 30:54.863
Oh shits gone bad.

31:01.711 --> 31:03.470
Well, want to get everything on camera.

31:03.470 --> 31:05.633
You know its documenting things.

31:09.110 --> 31:09.943
- We don't need
to document right now.

31:09.943 --> 31:11.647
We need to get into the car and go.

31:11.647 --> 31:12.788
Start the camera again when we're going.

31:12.788 --> 31:14.060

35:57.060 --> 35:58.890

35:58.890 --> 36:02.150
Its okay but there was,

36:02.150 --> 36:04.600
in Caduma, there was,

36:04.600 --> 36:06.330
I could see the smoke from here.

36:06.330 --> 36:08.430
You know what, that's
a good 20 miles away.

36:08.430 --> 36:10.803
So did you learn anything new?

36:11.740 --> 36:13.230
- No, not really.

36:13.230 --> 36:15.050
People are just taking cellphones

36:15.050 --> 36:17.220
and Go Pros off of bodies

36:17.220 --> 36:19.359
and uploading them online.

36:19.359 --> 36:21.890
Its a mess.

36:21.890 --> 36:24.060
- Okay well, I told
everyone to stay in town

36:24.060 --> 36:26.250
and nobody comes into
town, no matter what.

36:26.250 --> 36:28.617
- Wait you told everyone

36:28.617 --> 36:29.820
why are you in charge?

36:29.820 --> 36:31.300
- Babe, its my camp.

36:31.300 --> 36:33.470
I have the responsibility
to keep everybody safe.

36:33.470 --> 36:34.303
- No, no.

36:34.303 --> 36:35.136
Fuck that.

36:35.136 --> 36:35.969
Fuck that.

36:35.969 --> 36:37.580
You're a doctor, Stephanie.

36:37.580 --> 36:38.800
You're not a cop.

36:38.800 --> 36:39.950
No, don't laugh at me.

36:39.950 --> 36:41.140
Stay in your quarters.

36:41.140 --> 36:42.810
Keep the door shut, no matter what.

36:42.810 --> 36:44.840
- Chris, honey, its okay.

36:44.840 --> 36:46.360
Everybody here is fine.

36:46.360 --> 36:48.290
Okay, as long as nobody goes into town.

36:48.290 --> 36:49.775
Its going to be okay.

36:49.775 --> 36:51.330
Come on, I deal with
infectious disease, remember.

36:51.330 --> 36:52.495
Its what I do.

36:52.495 --> 36:53.620
- This is not the flu, Stephanie,

36:53.620 --> 36:54.900
this is not malaria.

36:54.900 --> 36:56.556
This is something.

36:56.556 --> 36:58.720
Steph, Stephanie.

36:58.720 --> 37:00.083
Fuck, Stephanie!

37:05.520 --> 37:07.920
- And this is where
I introduce you to us.

37:09.490 --> 37:11.740
- Well hello, everyone, how are you?

37:11.740 --> 37:14.200

37:22.479 --> 37:25.820
We are sitting in the middle
of the zombie apocalypse.

37:25.820 --> 37:27.210
Its finally happened

37:27.210 --> 37:28.970
and no one is more prepared than us.

37:28.970 --> 37:29.810
Is that right, Tommy?

37:29.810 --> 37:30.770
- That's right.

37:30.770 --> 37:32.190
We got everything we need.

37:32.190 --> 37:34.050
- Most importantly, what's this?

37:34.050 --> 37:34.883
- A script.

37:34.883 --> 37:35.970
- That's right, we got a script.

37:35.970 --> 37:38.040
Second importantly, we got one of these.

37:38.040 --> 37:39.270
- Camera.

37:39.270 --> 37:40.590
- I'm kidding, we've got two of these.

37:40.590 --> 37:42.079
- Boom.

37:42.079 --> 37:42.912
- Production value.

37:42.912 --> 37:44.300
What else we got?

37:44.300 --> 37:45.263
We got the zombies.

37:46.310 --> 37:47.373
- Holy shit.

37:48.280 --> 37:49.900
This is dangerous.

37:49.900 --> 37:51.760
- That has been happening.
- Okay, so.

37:51.760 --> 37:53.110
Yeah okay.
- That has been happening

37:53.110 --> 37:54.760
for the past three days.

37:54.760 --> 37:56.250
You know what we're
gonna have to do, right?

37:56.250 --> 37:57.700
- What are we gonna have to do?

37:57.700 --> 37:58.703
- We're gonna have to shoot a movie.

37:58.703 --> 38:00.260
We're gonna have to shoot a
motherfucking masterpiece.

38:00.260 --> 38:01.481
God damn it, god damn it.

38:05.110 --> 38:05.943
Just get her.

38:08.950 --> 38:10.623
Now where's the clapper?

38:12.096 --> 38:13.279
Where's the clapper?

38:13.279 --> 38:14.457
- Bottom of this.

38:14.457 --> 38:15.460
Where'd you put the slammer?

38:15.460 --> 38:16.293
Is it up there?

38:16.293 --> 38:17.330

38:17.330 --> 38:19.940
Okay, I'm just gonna say my line.

38:19.940 --> 38:21.310
- Okay.

38:21.310 --> 38:22.793
and shoot her in the face.

38:24.070 --> 38:25.920
- Where's the gun?

38:25.920 --> 38:26.753
Why didn't you bring,

38:26.753 --> 38:28.096

38:28.096 --> 38:28.929
Is it up there?

38:28.929 --> 38:29.762
- No, its outside.

38:29.762 --> 38:30.595
Its in the kitchen.

38:30.595 --> 38:31.428
Its in the kitchen.

38:31.428 --> 38:32.261
Can you go get it?

38:32.261 --> 38:33.135
- Yes, I'll go get it.
- Thank you.

38:33.135 --> 38:34.255

38:34.255 --> 38:35.088
Okay so I'm just gonna,

38:35.088 --> 38:36.070
I'll shoot her in the face.

38:36.070 --> 38:37.090
- Be careful with that.

38:37.090 --> 38:37.923
Its loaded.

38:37.923 --> 38:38.756
- I'm just gonna shoot her in the face.

38:38.756 --> 38:39.999
- No, no.

38:39.999 --> 38:40.832
You're gonna throw the bullet at her?

38:40.832 --> 38:41.973
You don't have to do that with your hand.

38:44.160 --> 38:45.730
- I shot a gun before.

38:45.730 --> 38:46.810
- You used a gun before?
- Yeah I have.

38:46.810 --> 38:48.040
- Have you used a gun before?
- You know what,

38:48.040 --> 38:49.490
don't be a dick.

38:49.490 --> 38:50.323
Alright, I'm gonna do this.

Yeah, its good.

39:00.847 --> 39:02.237

39:11.710 --> 39:13.136
Right?

39:13.136 --> 39:13.969
That's really shitty.

39:13.969 --> 39:14.802
- She was supposed to pop out.

39:14.802 --> 39:15.635

39:15.635 --> 39:16.468
Why didn't we get a zombie that,

I don't know.

39:17.340 --> 39:18.173
Can fucking do something?

39:18.173 --> 39:20.330
- Do I look like someone who
can tackle a body builder?

39:20.330 --> 39:21.764
You idiot.

39:21.764 --> 39:22.893
- They're zombies though.

39:24.063 --> 39:25.343
- Lets just do this one

39:25.343 --> 39:26.840
I'll shoot her in the face.

39:26.840 --> 39:28.265
- Okay.

39:32.560 --> 39:34.760
- Alright, Z-Cam is live.

39:34.760 --> 39:36.070
- Z cam, like zombie cam?

39:36.070 --> 39:36.940
- Yeah, like zombie cam.

39:36.940 --> 39:38.263
That's my thing.

39:38.263 --> 39:39.262
- That's a really good idea.

39:39.262 --> 39:40.264
I thank you, sir.

39:40.264 --> 39:41.097
But maybe we should shoot her in the face.

39:41.097 --> 39:42.870
So I'm not holding a
goddamn zombie anymore.

39:42.870 --> 39:44.510
- Maybe now is
the time for me to discuss

39:44.510 --> 39:46.601
like being on screen every once in awhile.

39:46.601 --> 39:47.450
- You want to hold this thing?

39:47.450 --> 39:48.738
Shoot the goddamn zombie.

39:48.738 --> 39:50.543
- Okay, I'll shoot her.

39:50.543 --> 39:51.764
God damn it!

39:51.764 --> 39:52.597
That was.

39:53.705 --> 39:55.844
That was pretty cool.

39:55.844 --> 39:57.065
- You could shoot the next one.

39:57.065 --> 39:58.124
You want to shoot the next one?

39:58.124 --> 39:59.258
You want the gun?

39:59.258 --> 40:00.091
I'll take the pole.

40:00.091 --> 40:02.025
I just shot a zombie in the fucking head.

40:02.025 --> 40:02.858
- TMZ!

40:04.644 --> 40:06.543
- I killed you.

40:11.050 --> 40:12.330
Yeah!

40:12.330 --> 40:15.680
Let's get that guy in the
motherfucking onesies.

40:15.680 --> 40:18.081
Pull up real slow, I want to
get a good shot at this one.

40:18.081 --> 40:19.086
- Alright, alright.

40:19.086 --> 40:20.200
- Three, two, one.

40:20.200 --> 40:21.393
Jam Boy.
- Boom!

40:22.644 --> 40:24.564
Fuck that dude.
- yeah!

40:24.564 --> 40:25.740
- Oh that shit was awesome.

40:25.740 --> 40:26.573
- What I'm talking about.

40:26.573 --> 40:27.407
- What was that?

40:27.407 --> 40:28.585
- Jesus Christ!

40:30.423 --> 40:31.256
- Fucking A.

40:31.256 --> 40:32.550
- Oh shit.
- Damn it.

40:32.550 --> 40:33.827
- Let's go get her.

40:33.827 --> 40:35.480
Let's get in nice and tight.

40:35.480 --> 40:37.040
- Oh shit yeah.

40:37.040 --> 40:38.660
Look at that.

40:38.660 --> 40:39.850
Look that, that.

40:39.850 --> 40:41.150
Oh shit, he's still alive.

40:42.703 --> 40:44.143
Don't let him get it.

40:45.130 --> 40:47.338
Richie, you think this ones
right for the attic scene?

40:47.338 --> 40:48.410
- I don't know, man.

40:48.410 --> 40:50.500
We kind of broke this one.

40:50.500 --> 40:51.540
- Oh wait, Richie.

40:51.540 --> 40:52.964
Check that out.

40:52.964 --> 40:54.653
Oh she's even better.

40:58.761 --> 41:01.010
Super suspenseful because its
a really tense moment for me.

41:01.010 --> 41:01.863
Hey, Richie.

41:03.200 --> 41:04.950
This camera down here we got,

41:04.950 --> 41:06.677
I got it set up.

41:06.677 --> 41:07.593
Its gonna look great.

41:10.270 --> 41:11.390
Richie?

41:11.390 --> 41:13.365
Oh fuck.

41:14.198 --> 41:15.031
not funny.

41:15.031 --> 41:16.290
- Its kind of funny.

41:16.290 --> 41:18.100
- This bitch is fucking crazy.

41:18.100 --> 41:19.550
- Yeah.
- Hot.

41:19.550 --> 41:21.120
This bitch is fucking crazy hot.

41:21.120 --> 41:23.063
- I mean if you're
into that kind of stuff.

41:23.990 --> 41:25.110
- I guess I am.

41:25.110 --> 41:26.270
- She's our lead.

41:26.270 --> 41:28.299
So she's gonna come at you.

41:28.299 --> 41:29.359
- Yeah, what?

41:29.359 --> 41:30.840
What do you mean she's gonna come at me?

41:30.840 --> 41:32.100
- She's gonna come at you.

41:32.100 --> 41:33.967
I'm gonna save the day, okay?

41:33.967 --> 41:35.090
You got a mattress down there,

41:35.090 --> 41:36.130
just in case you fall.

41:36.130 --> 41:37.360
If anything happens,

41:37.360 --> 41:38.716
you got the gun.

41:38.716 --> 41:39.549
- Okay.
_ Okay.

41:39.549 --> 41:40.760
You can trust me on that.

41:40.760 --> 41:41.610
If anything goes weird,

41:41.610 --> 41:43.721
I will kill her immediately.
- okay, I trust you.

41:43.721 --> 41:44.735
I trust you, Richie.

41:44.735 --> 41:45.568
- If you want,
I can kill her right now.

41:45.568 --> 41:46.964
We'll start over from scratch.

41:46.964 --> 41:47.797
Well get another one.
- No, no.

41:47.797 --> 41:48.730
No, no we'll just.

41:48.730 --> 41:50.460
She's just kind of lively.

41:50.460 --> 41:51.293
Okay.

41:51.293 --> 41:52.126
Okay.

41:52.126 --> 41:53.140
- Now slate.

41:53.140 --> 41:55.280
- Okay.
- You got this, bro.

41:55.280 --> 41:57.780
- This is gonna be epic, jam boy.

41:57.780 --> 41:58.678
- Action.

41:58.678 --> 41:59.511
Oh shit, shit shit.

41:59.511 --> 42:00.344
God damn it.

42:00.344 --> 42:01.820
Oh no!

42:01.820 --> 42:02.879
Fuck no.

42:02.879 --> 42:05.279
God damn it, no.

42:06.740 --> 42:08.143
Shit.

42:08.143 --> 42:08.976
Tommy!

42:13.978 --> 42:14.920
oh god damn it.

42:14.920 --> 42:15.840
Jesus Christ.

42:15.840 --> 42:18.360
Tommy, Tommy.

42:18.360 --> 42:19.970
Tommy, don't fucking turn, man.

42:19.970 --> 42:21.370
Don't you dare fucking turn.

42:40.319 --> 42:42.069
I can't believe this.

42:43.597 --> 42:46.477
I can't believe I fucking got the shot.

42:50.122 --> 42:51.372
That's fucking.

42:53.678 --> 42:56.362
That's fucking awesome.

42:56.362 --> 42:57.803
Fucking nailed that shit.

43:03.400 --> 43:07.250
- Well, been in here now a couple days.

43:07.250 --> 43:10.990
This is not really that
exciting to be in here.

43:10.990 --> 43:12.723
You know, uh.

43:13.600 --> 43:15.270
You know, of course there's no cable.

43:15.270 --> 43:17.080
I mean, I've got lots of things to watch.

43:17.080 --> 43:19.003
I mean, okay, I have
lots of things to watch.

43:19.003 --> 43:20.380
Luckily I'm in here.

43:20.380 --> 43:21.580
The power's working.

43:21.580 --> 43:23.360
You know, in a lot of these kind of things

43:23.360 --> 43:24.610
when its like a zombie outbreak

43:24.610 --> 43:25.630
and things like that happen,

43:25.630 --> 43:27.530
the powers go, all this kind of stuff.

43:27.530 --> 43:28.550
But I'm lucky.

43:28.550 --> 43:30.202
You know I mean, for some reason,

43:30.202 --> 43:32.100
things are working here

43:32.100 --> 43:34.950
and I figure, I'll just put up with this.

43:34.950 --> 43:36.750
But I've been hearing things outside.

43:36.750 --> 43:37.583
I've been hearing,

43:37.583 --> 43:38.960
you know I was able to originally

43:38.960 --> 43:40.030
go outside this door

43:40.030 --> 43:40.863
and get a few things

43:40.863 --> 43:42.290
and I would quickly come back

43:42.290 --> 43:43.910
but I've been hearing things out there.

43:43.910 --> 43:47.120
So now I'm pretty much
stuck in this fucking room.

43:47.120 --> 43:49.000
I can't leave this room anymore

43:49.000 --> 43:51.150
and I only have so much food in here.

43:51.150 --> 43:52.618
I just have a little bit of water

43:52.618 --> 43:53.451
and some crack, I have nothing.

43:53.451 --> 43:54.480
I hardly have anything.

43:54.480 --> 43:55.770
So now I'm stuck in here.

43:55.770 --> 43:56.710
Can't leave this room

43:56.710 --> 43:57.543
cause I'm pretty goddamn sure

43:57.543 --> 44:00.560
there's a fucking zombie
right outside this door.

44:00.560 --> 44:02.490
So I am stuck in here now

44:02.490 --> 44:03.876
and I don't know what I'm gonna do.

44:03.876 --> 44:05.430
You know, like I said.

44:05.430 --> 44:07.470
This was fun at first, in a weird way,

44:07.470 --> 44:09.130
in a weird sense of,

44:09.130 --> 44:11.080
you know you always have this idea.

44:11.080 --> 44:12.858
I said before about, if
you were in a zombie movie,

44:12.858 --> 44:13.919
what would you do, where would you go,

44:13.919 --> 44:15.236
what would happen?

44:15.236 --> 44:16.138
But now that I'm in it

44:16.138 --> 44:17.242
and fucking experience it,

44:17.242 --> 44:18.538
its not really that fun

44:18.538 --> 44:21.098
and like I said,

44:21.098 --> 44:22.100
I'm in here all by my fucking self.

44:22.100 --> 44:25.150
I've been here by myself for fucking days

44:25.150 --> 44:27.620
and I'm so goddamn sick and tired

44:27.620 --> 44:29.000
of being in here.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.940
You know, I know I can
watch the things I want,

44:30.940 --> 44:32.970
I know that I can do all
the kind of things I want

44:32.970 --> 44:34.730
but its getting tiresome

44:34.730 --> 44:36.830
and I just need to get out of here

44:36.830 --> 44:39.680
and I need to be able to
have something else to eat.

44:39.680 --> 44:41.010
You know I've been trying to lose weight

44:41.010 --> 44:42.420
and I've been losing weight in here

44:42.420 --> 44:44.260
but not in the sense that I want to

44:44.260 --> 44:46.070
because I'm losing weight for what?

44:46.070 --> 44:47.500
I'm gonna fucking die.

44:47.500 --> 44:49.260
So what does it even matter anymore?

44:49.260 --> 44:50.781
I could be as fat as a house now

44:50.781 --> 44:52.050
and it wouldn't make any difference

44:52.050 --> 44:53.590
because I'm not gonna,

44:53.590 --> 44:54.483
if I leave this room,

44:54.483 --> 44:56.160
the zombies don't fucking leave.

44:56.160 --> 44:58.233
They're gonna go out there
and just fucking eat me.

44:59.450 --> 45:01.077
Well I'll give you guys another update

45:01.077 --> 45:03.040
in awhile or something.

45:03.040 --> 45:05.203
Hopefully some of you
guys out there are alright

45:05.203 --> 45:08.643
and you know thanks for
continuing to watch.

45:08.643 --> 45:09.476
Alright.

45:23.700 --> 45:24.533
- Oh god.

45:27.363 --> 45:28.196
Oh god.

45:29.992 --> 45:30.825
Oh god.

45:32.676 --> 45:33.689
Oh god.

45:33.689 --> 45:34.522
I can't do this.

45:34.522 --> 45:35.355
I can't do this.

45:35.355 --> 45:36.188
- Okay, just relax and breathe.

45:36.188 --> 45:37.483
Just focus on your breathing.

45:38.570 --> 45:40.643
- Are you fucking kidding
me with that cellphone?

45:40.643 --> 45:43.011
- Okay, alright look, I'm on it.

45:43.011 --> 45:45.272
I'm on it.

45:45.272 --> 45:46.105
I'm on it.

45:46.105 --> 45:46.938
Okay, okay.

45:46.938 --> 45:47.771
Its just, this is important
to me, though, right?

45:47.771 --> 45:48.744
Like this is our baby

45:48.744 --> 45:49.900
and its our moment and if we survive it.

45:49.900 --> 45:53.661
- I can't do this without
you or I might die.

45:53.661 --> 45:56.541
That important enough for you?

46:03.283 --> 46:07.622
- Its fucking freezing in here.

46:07.622 --> 46:10.403
Its fucking freezing.

46:10.403 --> 46:12.685
Its fucking freezing in here.

46:12.685 --> 46:14.618
Its fucking freezing.

46:14.618 --> 46:16.925
Its fucking freezing in here.

46:16.925 --> 46:19.181
Its fucking freezing.

46:19.181 --> 46:21.650
Its fucking freezing in here.

46:21.650 --> 46:24.220
It fucking stinks.

46:24.220 --> 46:26.170
It fucking stinks in here.

46:30.390 --> 46:34.923
- Okay, this is a
record that we're making.

46:37.101 --> 46:38.301
You sure--
- Is it on?

46:38.301 --> 46:39.303
- Its on.

46:39.303 --> 46:40.356
You sure you want to do this?

46:40.356 --> 46:41.189
- Yeah, yeah no I'm sure.

46:41.189 --> 46:42.360
- You don't have to do--

46:42.360 --> 46:43.464
- We have to do this.

46:43.464 --> 46:44.984
- Alright, alright, okay.

46:44.984 --> 46:47.817
Let's, let's at least do it right.

46:49.520 --> 46:50.941
What's your name?

46:50.941 --> 46:52.563
- My names Joanne Miller.

46:52.563 --> 46:53.903
- And do you know where you are?

46:55.520 --> 46:56.520
- I'm in my kitchen.

46:57.380 --> 46:58.480
- What city?

46:58.480 --> 46:59.880
- Los Angeles.

46:59.880 --> 47:01.330
- And what year is it?

47:01.330 --> 47:02.673
- 2015.

47:03.820 --> 47:05.730
- Who's the president?

47:05.730 --> 47:06.690
- Barack Obama.

47:06.690 --> 47:08.339
- Okay, good, good.

47:08.339 --> 47:09.270
You're in good shape.

47:09.270 --> 47:10.270
How are you feeling?

47:11.520 --> 47:13.833
- Just a little bit of
pain where I was bitten.

47:17.790 --> 47:19.483
- Do you remember who bit you?

47:24.991 --> 47:27.272
You know what, you don't
have to answer that

47:27.272 --> 47:28.222
if its too painful.

47:35.520 --> 47:36.353
- Jeffery.

47:42.320 --> 47:43.840
I didn't shoot him in
time, I couldn't do it.

47:43.840 --> 47:44.690
I couldn't do it.

47:46.413 --> 47:47.955
And I knew it.
- I understand.

47:47.955 --> 47:49.235
I understand.

47:49.235 --> 47:50.952
I understand.

47:50.952 --> 47:53.155
- Do you understand that
you have to shoot me

47:53.155 --> 47:54.232
when the times come?

47:54.232 --> 47:55.235
Do you know you have to do it?

47:55.235 --> 47:56.232
- I don't know if I can do it--

47:56.232 --> 47:57.235
- You have to fucking do it!

47:57.235 --> 47:58.232
- I don't know if I can.

47:58.232 --> 47:59.530
- You have to shoot me!

47:59.530 --> 48:00.680
You take that fucking shotgun

48:00.680 --> 48:01.790
and you shoot me when the time comes.

48:01.790 --> 48:03.880
You know you have to do it.

48:03.880 --> 48:05.880
- Alright, we don't
have to worry about that now.

48:05.880 --> 48:07.580
I mean, how do you feel right now?

48:11.533 --> 48:12.616
- I feel, uh.

48:14.120 --> 48:15.043
I feel,

48:16.410 --> 48:17.393
I feel sick.

48:18.250 --> 48:19.083
I.

48:28.370 --> 48:31.016
- Joanne, Jesus.

48:31.016 --> 48:34.493
Joanne, how do you feel?

48:34.493 --> 48:36.730
- I feel,

48:36.730 --> 48:37.563
I feel,

48:38.792 --> 48:40.300
I feel a little strange.

48:40.300 --> 48:42.050
- Stay with me, stay with me.

48:44.093 --> 48:44.926
- I feel.

48:46.360 --> 48:51.360
I feel strange.

48:56.500 --> 48:58.700
I just thought of my
mother for some reason.

49:00.090 --> 49:02.253
- She's been dead quite awhile.

49:04.580 --> 49:05.413
- She has.

49:07.360 --> 49:08.193
- Years.

49:09.750 --> 49:11.273
- I remember her so clearly.

49:13.630 --> 49:16.296
- What was her name?

49:16.296 --> 49:17.213
- Her name?

49:24.413 --> 49:26.050
Her name.

49:26.050 --> 49:27.400
- Your mother's name.

49:30.772 --> 49:32.355
- I don't remember.

49:34.675 --> 49:36.099
My mother's name, I don't remember.

49:36.099 --> 49:37.197
- Okay, okay, that's alright.

49:37.197 --> 49:38.195
That's alright.

49:38.195 --> 49:39.475
- I don't remember my mother's name.

49:39.475 --> 49:40.513
- Alright, alright, alright.

49:40.513 --> 49:41.346
Alright.

49:44.397 --> 49:46.560
- I don't remember my mother's name.

49:46.560 --> 49:48.270
- Joanne, Joanne, stay with me.

49:48.270 --> 49:49.395
- I'm changing.

49:49.395 --> 49:50.434
I'm starting to change.

49:50.434 --> 49:52.675
I'm starting to lose my mind.

49:52.675 --> 49:54.456
- Don't worry, don't worry.

49:57.868 --> 49:59.073
Oh Jesus.

49:59.073 --> 49:59.906
Oh Jesus.

50:02.572 --> 50:04.156
What's going on?

50:04.156 --> 50:06.156
How are you feeling now?

50:07.655 --> 50:08.905
- I feel weird.

50:09.792 --> 50:11.527
- Not good, yeah.
- Weird.

50:11.527 --> 50:12.825
- I know, I know.

50:12.825 --> 50:13.863
Just hold on.

50:13.863 --> 50:15.163
Just go with me.

50:16.160 --> 50:17.468
Hold on,

50:17.468 --> 50:18.476
- Yes, yes.

50:18.476 --> 50:19.729
- Okay, uh.

50:19.729 --> 50:21.479
Do you know, do you know your name?

50:23.083 --> 50:25.308
- Joanne.
- Good, good, good

50:25.308 --> 50:26.708
do you know what year it is?

50:28.289 --> 50:29.810
- 1941.

50:29.810 --> 50:32.163
- Okay, okay and uh.

50:34.151 --> 50:35.183
Who is the president?

50:36.447 --> 50:39.452
- I don't know, I don't know.

50:39.452 --> 50:41.063
- Do you know where you are?

50:42.449 --> 50:43.928
- I don't know, I don't know.

50:43.928 --> 50:45.349
- Oh Jesus.

50:45.349 --> 50:46.347
What about your son?

50:46.347 --> 50:47.180
What's your son's name?

50:48.492 --> 50:49.910
- My son?

50:49.910 --> 50:51.630
- You don't know your son's name?

50:53.692 --> 50:54.525
- My son?

50:56.380 --> 50:58.707
- Okay, alright nevermind.

50:58.707 --> 50:59.540
Its not important.

50:59.540 --> 51:00.373
Its not important.

51:02.020 --> 51:04.250
Oh Jesus, what am I gonna do?

51:04.250 --> 51:05.840
Joanne?

51:05.840 --> 51:07.110
- My mind is breaking.

51:07.110 --> 51:10.160
My mind, I can't make thinks like before.

51:10.160 --> 51:11.930
I mind is beginning break.

51:11.930 --> 51:14.103
Its not think.

51:15.089 --> 51:16.551
- Alright, alright,
its not important.

51:16.551 --> 51:17.623
- I'm fading, I'm fading.

51:17.623 --> 51:19.050
- Okay, just hold on, just hold on.

51:19.050 --> 51:21.570
Stay with me, stay with me.

51:21.570 --> 51:23.111
- Yes, yes.

51:23.111 --> 51:24.111
- Yes.

51:25.532 --> 51:26.673
Oh Jesus.

51:26.673 --> 51:27.911
Oh Jesus.

51:31.840 --> 51:32.673
Does that hurt?

51:32.673 --> 51:35.843
- Yeah, not so much.

51:37.191 --> 51:39.683
Its, it doesn't hurt as much.

51:42.066 --> 51:42.899
Shoot me.

51:42.899 --> 51:43.831
- I can't.

51:43.831 --> 51:44.828
I can't do it.

51:44.828 --> 51:46.209
- Shoot me!

51:46.209 --> 51:49.068
- I can't do it Joanne.

51:49.068 --> 51:51.560
- You have to do it.

51:51.560 --> 51:53.260
- You're still here with me.

51:54.247 --> 51:56.012
- Who, who are you?

51:56.012 --> 51:57.940
- I'm Donald, I'm your husband.

51:57.940 --> 52:00.140
I'm Jeffery's father.

52:00.140 --> 52:01.260
Joanne.

52:01.260 --> 52:03.033
Joanne, I can't do it.

52:04.700 --> 52:05.969
I can't do it.

52:05.969 --> 52:07.948
I love, I love you.

52:07.948 --> 52:09.457
- I love....

52:12.412 --> 52:17.412
- Oh god.

52:17.630 --> 52:20.740
- Haven't slept in three days.

52:28.700 --> 52:33.700
My wife Laura hasn't eaten in five days.

52:37.520 --> 52:40.213
She hasn't had any water
in five days, either.

52:47.292 --> 52:48.625
And while I know

52:51.560 --> 52:56.170
that I'm gonna die

52:57.670 --> 53:01.500
or get infected

53:05.770 --> 53:09.650
that doesn't mean that
I can't have some fun

53:13.790 --> 53:15.850
because look

53:20.295 --> 53:21.473
look what I've got.

53:28.300 --> 53:32.313
I wish that that was tequila.

53:34.290 --> 53:39.107
Because I drank all the tequila

53:41.060 --> 53:41.980
three days ago

53:45.772 --> 53:47.022
and I know that

53:50.636 --> 53:52.969
I'm gonna die in this place.

53:58.160 --> 53:59.650
- Okay things are coming back.

53:59.650 --> 54:01.532
I can't do this quickly.

54:01.532 --> 54:03.280
Okay so its not sleeping sickness

54:03.280 --> 54:05.870
but what, what do we know
about sleeping sickness

54:05.870 --> 54:07.735
is its protozoa,

54:07.735 --> 54:11.100
really super primitive
form of life, protozoa.

54:11.100 --> 54:12.570
You can't even see.

54:12.570 --> 54:14.200
Protozoa.

54:14.200 --> 54:16.070
That's what causes,

54:16.070 --> 54:17.360
what are the protozoa, what diseases.

54:17.360 --> 54:18.610
We need to be able to
find what's connecting

54:18.610 --> 54:20.113
these together

54:20.113 --> 54:20.946
cause it can explain how this work

54:20.946 --> 54:22.010
because because because.

54:22.010 --> 54:23.990
Something like toxoplasmosis from cats,

54:23.990 --> 54:25.010
that's a protozoa disease

54:25.010 --> 54:26.710
and you could have people who have this

54:26.710 --> 54:28.350
and don't display symptoms for awhile

54:28.350 --> 54:30.316
but its also connected with schizophrenia

54:30.316 --> 54:31.810
which is amazing, right,

54:31.810 --> 54:32.930
because we're talking about, again,

54:32.930 --> 54:37.500
now protozoa that is somehow,
you know, in the brain

54:37.500 --> 54:39.510
and its sort of a slow sort of issue.

54:39.510 --> 54:41.130
Something that go a little faster.

54:41.130 --> 54:42.611
You know you got that amoebic disease

54:42.611 --> 54:44.470
where it eats away and moves through.

54:44.470 --> 54:45.420
So there are other different kinds

54:45.420 --> 54:47.610
of protozoa issues.

54:47.610 --> 54:49.852
But trypanosomiasis,

54:49.852 --> 54:50.685
no, no.

54:50.685 --> 54:52.068
Gosh what's the name of it?

54:52.068 --> 54:53.420
Its in my notes.

54:53.420 --> 54:55.053
I've never studied it before.

54:56.270 --> 54:57.200
trichomoniasis,

54:57.200 --> 54:58.604
which is different.

54:58.604 --> 54:59.540
This is a sexually transmitted disease

54:59.540 --> 55:00.800
that is,

55:00.800 --> 55:02.520
or obviously we know how that spreads

55:02.520 --> 55:03.620
but this is not what we're talking about,

55:03.620 --> 55:05.068
people biting each other.

55:05.068 --> 55:05.901
But but but,

55:05.901 --> 55:07.207
this disease, very specifically,

55:07.207 --> 55:10.200
can gestate and men,

55:10.200 --> 55:12.540
particularly, can have this for years

55:12.540 --> 55:13.530
without spreading it

55:13.530 --> 55:14.430
or sharing any symptoms.

55:14.430 --> 55:16.900
They have this protozoa
disease lodged right there

55:16.900 --> 55:18.070
and it doesn't happen.

55:18.070 --> 55:19.210
So what we're talking about here

55:19.210 --> 55:20.810
is perhaps, perhaps some sort of protozoa,

55:20.810 --> 55:21.870
we don't know what it is,

55:21.870 --> 55:23.270
that is widely infected,

55:23.270 --> 55:24.240
who knows how it got there

55:24.240 --> 55:25.073
but people have it,

55:25.073 --> 55:26.220
everyone who gets bite,

55:26.220 --> 55:27.190
people already have it.

55:27.190 --> 55:28.690
The most universal exposure to this thing

55:28.690 --> 55:31.160
is protozoa living in the brain.

55:31.160 --> 55:33.100
Pass through the brain blood barrier

55:33.100 --> 55:35.640
years ago and its lodged in the brain

55:35.640 --> 55:36.473
and in these varying,

55:36.473 --> 55:38.428
the centers you know aggression
and things like this.

55:38.428 --> 55:39.920
What would happen now,
what would happen now,

55:39.920 --> 55:40.830
if you got bit,

55:40.830 --> 55:42.100
what would have to happen to your blood

55:42.100 --> 55:43.580
in order to activate the protozoa.

55:43.580 --> 55:44.700
Its not that you get infected,

55:44.700 --> 55:46.340
that's the thing is this bite

55:46.340 --> 55:47.780
is not an infectious bite.

55:47.780 --> 55:51.649
The bite, its gotta be
a protein or a toxin

55:51.649 --> 55:54.900
or something else that's
transmitted through the saliva

55:54.900 --> 55:56.060
that when it hits the blood stream,

55:56.060 --> 55:58.190
it activates those protozoa in ways

55:58.190 --> 55:59.450
that they weren't active before.

55:59.450 --> 56:00.710
You know maybe somehow

56:00.710 --> 56:01.620
somehow they're in the brain

56:01.620 --> 56:03.780
and they've linked up to sections to cells

56:03.780 --> 56:05.910
already and created this sort of complex.

56:05.910 --> 56:07.600
This happens in other sort of infections

56:07.600 --> 56:09.340
and that complex sits there, sits there

56:09.340 --> 56:10.260
and sits there and waits

56:10.260 --> 56:12.680
and when the toxin works, it changes.

56:12.680 --> 56:13.780
It changes quickly.

56:13.780 --> 56:15.733
It changes immediately and,

56:17.591 --> 56:19.351
and all of this happens.

56:19.351 --> 56:20.530
I wouldn't believe it either,

56:20.530 --> 56:22.280
but I saw it happen right there,

56:22.280 --> 56:23.340
three minutes.

56:25.990 --> 56:27.090
Look, I have to go.

56:27.090 --> 56:28.170
I can't do this anymore.

56:28.170 --> 56:29.560
Somebody's gonna have to get this

56:29.560 --> 56:30.790
and figure it out for me.

56:30.790 --> 56:31.623
They're coming back.

56:31.623 --> 56:33.550
I think I can get out of the building.

56:33.550 --> 56:36.033
I think I can get out but, I um.

56:37.310 --> 56:38.143
Sorry.

56:44.420 --> 56:45.483
- Jesus, where were you?

56:45.483 --> 56:47.393
Is that blood on your shirt?

56:49.720 --> 56:51.743
- I had to go on a food run.

56:53.220 --> 56:54.583
- You told me you already had food.

56:56.260 --> 56:58.250
- That was a couple weeks ago.

56:58.250 --> 57:01.023
- Babe, babe what is on your shirt?

57:02.327 --> 57:04.650
- I needed food, Stephanie.

57:04.650 --> 57:05.780
Why is it so dark there?

57:05.780 --> 57:07.300
What happened?

57:07.300 --> 57:09.780
- Oh the generator is unreliable

57:09.780 --> 57:12.485
so the lights are flaky but answer me,

57:12.485 --> 57:13.843
what is that on your shirt?

57:18.807 --> 57:20.090
- Blood.

57:20.090 --> 57:21.363
- Is it yours?

57:22.609 --> 57:24.960
Oh my god, did one of them bite you?

57:24.960 --> 57:26.577
Did you get bit?

57:28.247 --> 57:30.313
- Nothing bit me, I'm fine.

57:32.988 --> 57:33.821
- Alright, well babe.

57:33.821 --> 57:34.770
What the hell happened?

57:35.863 --> 57:36.696
- You know Rakeem

57:38.807 --> 57:39.957
the kid from next door?

57:40.800 --> 57:41.790
- Yeah?

57:41.790 --> 57:44.270
- He's always skateboarding

57:45.329 --> 57:47.143
and wearing a batman shirt.

57:52.640 --> 57:54.053
He was in a supermarket.

57:57.169 --> 57:59.729
- I'm so sorry you had to do that.

57:59.729 --> 58:02.040
I can't even imagine

58:03.140 --> 58:05.830
but you know what,

58:05.830 --> 58:07.500
he was already dead, okay?

58:07.500 --> 58:09.677
It wasn't Rakeem anymore.

58:11.425 --> 58:13.133
- He had this,

58:13.133 --> 58:14.703
this big knife with him.

58:16.650 --> 58:18.283
He must of got from the butcher.

58:22.300 --> 58:23.133
So hungry.

58:24.769 --> 58:26.197
I haven't eaten in days.

58:26.197 --> 58:27.343
- I know, I know.

58:28.348 --> 58:29.393
No one is gonna blame you.

58:33.664 --> 58:34.497
- I shot him.

58:36.640 --> 58:37.523
Over and over.

58:41.840 --> 58:43.460
- Wait.

58:43.460 --> 58:44.310
Wait, wait, wait.

58:45.840 --> 58:47.440
You said he was holding a knife.

58:48.785 --> 58:52.310
How could he have been holding a knife

58:52.310 --> 58:54.220
if he had already been turned into a?

58:55.201 --> 58:56.601
- I have to be here for you.

58:57.470 --> 59:00.810
Stephanie, I have to stay alive,

59:00.810 --> 59:03.823
Stephanie for when you come home.

59:05.900 --> 59:08.590
I need you to come home, Stephanie.

59:08.590 --> 59:09.423
I need you.

59:12.647 --> 59:16.333
- Babe, babe, no.

59:18.970 --> 59:20.760
- Hey, I'm your daddy

59:20.760 --> 59:23.150
and um, this is what I looked like

59:23.150 --> 59:24.883
the day you were born.

59:26.970 --> 59:30.093
Oh and this is your mommy and that's you.

59:31.110 --> 59:32.180
You don't even have a name yet.

59:32.180 --> 59:35.690
Its weird, right?

59:35.690 --> 59:38.020
the truth is its kind of
a crazy time right now,

59:38.020 --> 59:39.650
when you were born.

59:39.650 --> 59:41.357
There's, well there's bad things out there

59:41.357 --> 59:44.050
and so your mommy and I

59:44.050 --> 59:45.490
are down here hiding

59:45.490 --> 59:49.423
and we are keeping you safe, okay?

59:51.320 --> 59:55.243
You're safe and that's okay.

59:57.450 --> 01:00:00.030
This right here, this is what I'm proudest

01:00:00.030 --> 01:00:02.333
of in the whole world, your mommy and you.

01:00:06.622 --> 01:00:07.680
I'm not always that great at things,

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:10.473
been so many bad
businesses, bad decisions.

01:00:13.265 --> 01:00:14.385
bad times.

01:00:14.385 --> 01:00:16.980
And if I had to do one
thing right, one thing,

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:19.030
I am so glad that it is you and your mom.

01:00:21.185 --> 01:00:22.703
- Who are you talking to?

01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:25.033
- The baby.

01:00:26.242 --> 01:00:27.367
Yeah.

01:00:27.367 --> 01:00:28.369
- Oh.

01:00:28.369 --> 01:00:29.367
- You want to say anything?

01:00:29.367 --> 01:00:30.988
Jim?

01:00:30.988 --> 01:00:33.079
- We gotta go, we gotta go.

01:00:33.079 --> 01:00:34.369
- I can't, I can't.

01:00:34.369 --> 01:00:35.384
I'm too tired.

01:00:35.384 --> 01:00:36.391
- No come, we gotta.

01:00:36.391 --> 01:00:38.951
- I'm so tired.
- I know you are.

01:00:38.951 --> 01:00:40.430
I know how tired you are, please.

01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:45.689
Shit, they're through, they're through.

01:00:45.689 --> 01:00:47.769
- I can't.
- come on, yes you can.

01:00:47.769 --> 01:00:48.775
You can do it.

01:00:48.775 --> 01:00:49.772
You gotta.

01:00:49.772 --> 01:00:51.047
Shit, come on.
- okay.

01:00:51.047 --> 01:00:52.049
- Oh god.

01:00:52.049 --> 01:00:53.047
Come on, come on.

01:00:53.047 --> 01:00:54.551
Oh god.

01:00:54.551 --> 01:00:56.388
Come on, we gotta move.

01:00:56.388 --> 01:00:57.687
Come on, you can do this.

01:00:57.687 --> 01:00:58.689
Come on.

01:00:58.689 --> 01:01:00.311
Come on, they're so close.

01:01:00.311 --> 01:01:01.644
Please, come on.

01:01:02.485 --> 01:01:03.885
Let's get somewhere.

01:01:03.885 --> 01:01:05.303
They're right behind us.

01:01:06.544 --> 01:01:07.741
This way.

01:01:07.741 --> 01:01:08.991
In here, quick.

01:01:11.605 --> 01:01:12.855
Right this way.

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:20.780
- So my boy went across the street

01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:25.030
to go see maybe, see what was going on.

01:01:25.030 --> 01:01:26.400
Maybe they had the news going.

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:27.890
Try to figure out what's going on.

01:01:27.890 --> 01:01:28.890
Where we can go

01:01:28.890 --> 01:01:31.070
or anything like that.

01:01:31.070 --> 01:01:32.980
He's been gone over an hour

01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:34.260
and he hasn't come back yet

01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:36.992
and I just don't know what's, what's.

01:01:36.992 --> 01:01:38.353
Matt?

01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:44.480
Matt, is that you?

01:01:53.313 --> 01:01:55.803
Hey, you better not be
fucking with me, bro.

01:01:57.030 --> 01:01:59.003
This is not a laughing matter, man.

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:04.394
I mean, for real, we don't even know

01:02:04.394 --> 01:02:05.650
if this shit could be related

01:02:05.650 --> 01:02:06.860
or it could be unrelated.

01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:08.143
This isn't funny, man.

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:10.930
You got your laugh, just call it.

01:02:30.290 --> 01:02:31.123
Matt!

01:02:49.590 --> 01:02:51.150
Matt?

01:02:51.150 --> 01:02:51.983
Oh shit!

01:02:57.189 --> 01:02:58.191
Oh shit, dude.

01:02:58.191 --> 01:02:59.358
Oh shit, shit!

01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:08.670
- I'm just breaking out of jail now.

01:03:10.154 --> 01:03:12.393
I don't know what these things are.

01:03:14.752 --> 01:03:17.453
I know they killed my wife.

01:03:19.390 --> 01:03:20.900
They killed my mom,

01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:22.510
they killed everybody I know

01:03:25.056 --> 01:03:27.356
but if I can make it out
of this prison alive.

01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:30.030
I know one thing is true.

01:03:30.030 --> 01:03:33.560
I am gonna kill everyone last one

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.943
of these motherfucking zombies.

01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:39.733
That's my word or I will die trying.

01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:53.063
- Hey guys.

01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:58.010
I'm doing what I think is really

01:03:58.010 --> 01:03:59.140
gonna be the final update.

01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:03.847
I know I said before, I
don't see any hope for me.

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:11.170
I have absolutely no water, no food,

01:04:11.170 --> 01:04:12.920
no nothing left.

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:14.453
I can't leave this room.

01:04:15.330 --> 01:04:17.950
Yes, I know I could go out in the room

01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:21.380
and then I would be attacked

01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:23.260
and then I would end up turning into

01:04:24.770 --> 01:04:25.910
what's happened to everyone else

01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:26.890
and I don't want that.

01:04:26.890 --> 01:04:28.300
I don't want to.

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:31.810
You know, I've always loved zombie movies

01:04:31.810 --> 01:04:32.860
and all that kind of stuff

01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:33.930
but I don't want that.

01:04:33.930 --> 01:04:37.310
I don't want that to
be what happens to me.

01:04:37.310 --> 01:04:39.914
I would rather stay in this room

01:04:39.914 --> 01:04:42.920
and die in here

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:46.590
then have to you know to
have that happen to me.

01:04:46.590 --> 01:04:50.267
I can't face that
reality of that happening

01:04:50.267 --> 01:04:51.100
and you know,

01:04:52.530 --> 01:04:53.693
I don't know if,

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:57.830
if that happened if I would know,

01:04:57.830 --> 01:05:02.830
if I would remember myself before or what

01:05:03.070 --> 01:05:06.736
but I'm, rather stay in this room

01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:09.410
and totally starve to death

01:05:09.410 --> 01:05:13.000
than have to have that happen to me

01:05:15.053 --> 01:05:16.770
and I said, I'm in here

01:05:16.770 --> 01:05:19.970
I can't watch TV, I can't do anything

01:05:19.970 --> 01:05:21.640
I've been doing in here.

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:24.670
The lights off, absolutely starving

01:05:26.070 --> 01:05:28.023
with absolutely nothing else to eat.

01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:35.220
So, this will be my last video.

01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:39.470
I hope I have enough
battery left on this phone

01:05:39.470 --> 01:05:40.743
to get this uploaded.

01:05:41.830 --> 01:05:44.970
If not, hopefully
somebody finds this phone

01:05:44.970 --> 01:05:46.153
in years to come.

01:05:47.070 --> 01:05:48.720
You know you see these videos

01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:52.080
and just hope everyone doesn't forget me.

01:05:53.650 --> 01:05:55.930
So thank you everyone who
watched and subscribed

01:05:55.930 --> 01:05:57.100
to me all these years

01:05:58.690 --> 01:06:00.033
and I'll see you guys later.

01:06:05.936 --> 01:06:07.274
- Unexplained, as the violence.

01:06:07.274 --> 01:06:09.133
- Hey man, don't be recording this shit.

01:06:09.133 --> 01:06:10.133
- Don't trip man,

01:06:10.133 --> 01:06:12.173
no ones ever gonna see this.

01:06:12.173 --> 01:06:15.173
- You know this shits evidence, right?

01:06:15.173 --> 01:06:17.451
- No this dead fool is evidence.

01:07:12.166 --> 01:07:14.373
You expecting somebody?

01:07:14.373 --> 01:07:15.206
- Nope.

01:07:25.232 --> 01:07:26.490
- What are you doing, man?

01:07:26.490 --> 01:07:27.950
- I'm gonna see what this fool wants.

01:07:33.653 --> 01:07:34.805
- Fuck man.

01:07:34.805 --> 01:07:36.171
- Bro, what the hell do
you think you're doing?

01:07:36.171 --> 01:07:37.211
- That fucking crack head bit me, man.

01:07:37.211 --> 01:07:38.730
You turn into one of those things.

01:07:38.730 --> 01:07:40.831
- You can't just be
running in here like that.

01:07:42.693 --> 01:07:43.526
Walk this way.

01:07:43.526 --> 01:07:44.359
Through that door.

01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:54.043
- Whoa.

01:07:57.300 --> 01:07:59.180
Shit, what the fuck, dude.

01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:00.752
You don't have to do this, man.

01:08:00.752 --> 01:08:02.090
- You knocked on the wrong door, homie.

01:08:02.090 --> 01:08:03.530
- Fuck.

01:08:03.530 --> 01:08:04.363
- Now put your hands behind your back

01:08:04.363 --> 01:08:05.994
and we'll talk about it.

01:08:05.994 --> 01:08:07.044
- Fuck, come on, man.

01:08:09.333 --> 01:08:10.416
- Don't move.

01:08:13.210 --> 01:08:14.043
Quit moving.

01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:18.590
You fucking problem with me, homeboy.

01:08:20.790 --> 01:08:21.622
Sit up.

01:08:23.573 --> 01:08:26.693
Got something special for you.

01:08:26.693 --> 01:08:27.526
- Oh fuck.

01:08:30.250 --> 01:08:31.103
- Here, take these.

01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:38.330
- Dude, have you seen what's happening.

01:08:38.330 --> 01:08:40.279
There's bigger shit going on out there.

01:08:42.010 --> 01:08:43.670
- Business as usual.

01:08:43.670 --> 01:08:45.368
- Dude, but there's like high speed chases

01:08:45.368 --> 01:08:46.571
and crazy motherfuckers--

01:08:46.571 --> 01:08:48.154
- Shut the fuck up.

01:09:12.006 --> 01:09:14.089
Yeah, you like that shit?

01:09:15.252 --> 01:09:16.549
- Gave him a good right there, huh?

01:09:16.549 --> 01:09:18.145
- Hell yeah, bro.

01:09:18.145 --> 01:09:19.893
Damn, you see this motherfucker's arm?

01:09:19.893 --> 01:09:21.392
- What the fuck is that?

01:09:21.392 --> 01:09:23.013
Man, what's up with that shit?

01:09:23.013 --> 01:09:24.412
- Check that shit out.

01:09:25.412 --> 01:09:26.649
- Holy fuck, that shits nasty.

01:09:26.649 --> 01:09:28.080
Its deteriorating by the second.

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:30.109
- You said a crack head bit you?

01:09:30.109 --> 01:09:31.310
Fucking from where man?

01:09:31.310 --> 01:09:33.859
Not from LA, they don't
look like that around here.

01:09:37.750 --> 01:09:39.240
- Homeboy's fucking.

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:40.807
I don't know, somethings
going on with him.

01:09:41.973 --> 01:09:42.805
- Fuck.

01:09:42.805 --> 01:09:43.639
Dude what the fuck?

01:09:43.639 --> 01:09:45.040
- Hey, somethings
going on with his eyes, man.

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:45.993
Oh shit.

01:09:47.493 --> 01:09:49.779
Hey somethings not right here, man.

01:09:49.779 --> 01:09:52.120
Hey, somethings not right here, man.

01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:52.953
Hey!

01:09:57.152 --> 01:09:57.985
Oh fuck.

01:10:00.489 --> 01:10:01.322
Oh fuck!

01:10:02.553 --> 01:10:04.730
Fuck, oh shit, man.

01:10:04.730 --> 01:10:06.074
Oh shit.

01:10:06.074 --> 01:10:07.711
Oh shit.

01:10:07.711 --> 01:10:08.544
No!

01:11:09.611 --> 01:11:11.052
- Its okay.

01:11:11.052 --> 01:11:12.049
Its okay.

01:11:12.049 --> 01:11:12.882
Jimmy, please not.

01:11:12.882 --> 01:11:14.185
Just turn it off, please.

01:11:14.185 --> 01:11:15.250
- Come on, just say something to her.

01:11:15.250 --> 01:11:16.573
You know, for the future.

01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:18.333
- What future?

01:11:18.333 --> 01:11:20.240
There is no future.

01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:21.590
- Don't say that.

01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:22.910
Its gonna be okay.

01:11:22.910 --> 01:11:24.332
Alright?

01:11:24.332 --> 01:11:25.560
Everything is gonna be okay.

01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:27.750
Just say something to her.

01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:29.230
You don't even have to look at the camera.

01:11:29.230 --> 01:11:30.790
Just talk to her so that she knows

01:11:30.790 --> 01:11:31.933
that you were here.

01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:34.423
Okay?

01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:36.993
- Okay.

01:11:37.948 --> 01:11:39.190
- Okay.

01:11:39.190 --> 01:11:40.373
- Hi, sweetie.

01:11:42.125 --> 01:11:43.133
I know you're scared.

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:45.660
I'm scared too.

01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:46.913
- Hang on, hang on.

01:11:46.913 --> 01:11:48.450
I think the batteries dying.

01:11:48.450 --> 01:11:50.167
- Are you fucking kidding me?

01:11:50.167 --> 01:11:51.710
- No, its.

01:11:51.710 --> 01:11:52.543
Look its okay, alright.

01:11:52.543 --> 01:11:54.020
We'll just use yours,

01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:56.210
use your phone, it will be fine.

01:11:56.210 --> 01:11:57.553
We'll still get it.

01:11:57.553 --> 01:11:59.729
Just, you know it will be okay.

01:11:59.729 --> 01:12:00.562
Alright.

01:12:02.150 --> 01:12:03.020
Okay.

01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:06.483
How do I get back to the camera on this?

01:12:07.566 --> 01:12:09.310
- Okay.

01:12:09.310 --> 01:12:11.130
I want to do this, okay.

01:12:11.130 --> 01:12:12.223
Before its too late, please.

01:12:12.223 --> 01:12:14.393
I just, I want to film this, okay?

01:12:15.370 --> 01:12:17.713
- Heather, who's David?

01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:20.140
- What?

01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:21.253
- Who's David?

01:12:22.430 --> 01:12:23.750
- Give me my phone, sweetie.

01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:24.583
- No, no.

01:12:24.583 --> 01:12:25.416
"I have a right to know.

01:12:25.416 --> 01:12:27.140
If you don't get the
test, I'm going to tell

01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:29.050
your husband everything.

01:12:29.050 --> 01:12:31.220
Call me as soon as you
hear from the doctor."

01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:32.297
what is this?

01:12:32.297 --> 01:12:34.110
- Its a joke, he was joking, sweetie.

01:12:34.110 --> 01:12:35.030
Its nothing.

01:12:35.030 --> 01:12:36.572
- What does he mean,

01:12:36.572 --> 01:12:38.030
what test?

01:12:38.030 --> 01:12:38.863
- Its nothing.

01:12:38.863 --> 01:12:39.696
Okay, please.

01:12:39.696 --> 01:12:41.380
We are a family now, alright?

01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:42.213
We are a family.

01:12:42.213 --> 01:12:43.670
Remember that.

01:12:43.670 --> 01:12:44.673
We have to stick together.
- heather, what the fuck

01:12:44.673 --> 01:12:45.506
is this?

01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:48.480
- I met someone

01:12:51.713 --> 01:12:52.546
and we dated

01:12:54.530 --> 01:12:57.290
and it was a big mistake and I'm sorry.

01:12:57.290 --> 01:12:59.163
I'm so sorry.

01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:03.993
But, I ended it and,

01:13:05.328 --> 01:13:06.973
and then I found out that I was pregnant.

01:13:13.132 --> 01:13:15.049
- Did you get the test?

01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:25.591
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:13:25.591 --> 01:13:26.424
- Please, please Jimmy, please.

01:13:26.424 --> 01:13:27.890
We are all she has.

01:13:27.890 --> 01:13:29.390
We have to stick together for her.

01:13:29.390 --> 01:13:30.890
We have to survive for her, please.

01:13:30.890 --> 01:13:31.723
Please.

01:13:32.570 --> 01:13:34.369
- She's not our baby.

01:13:35.873 --> 01:13:36.706
- Oh god, oh god, they're here.

01:13:36.706 --> 01:13:37.676
Please, please.

01:13:37.676 --> 01:13:39.255
I can't do this without you.

01:13:39.255 --> 01:13:40.535
Get up, please get up.

01:13:40.535 --> 01:13:41.368
Please.

01:13:43.457 --> 01:13:44.940
Oh my god no, no.

01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:46.060
No!

01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:47.893
No, Jimmy, please, no.

01:13:50.156 --> 01:13:51.323
Jimmy, get up.

01:13:53.399 --> 01:13:55.170
Get up, Jimmy.

01:13:55.170 --> 01:13:57.297
Please, please get up.

01:13:57.297 --> 01:13:58.357
No!

01:13:58.357 --> 01:13:59.190
Not Jimmy.

01:13:59.190 --> 01:14:00.357
Please, Jimmy.

01:14:02.359 --> 01:14:03.617
Oh my baby.

01:14:03.617 --> 01:14:04.759
Oh my baby.

01:14:04.759 --> 01:14:05.592
Please no.

01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:10.912
Please not my baby.

01:14:51.915 --> 01:14:53.553
- I.

01:14:54.908 --> 01:14:55.963
I'm alone in my flat.

01:14:57.152 --> 01:14:59.540
I'm waiting for help.

01:14:59.540 --> 01:15:01.540
I'm waiting for help, so please help me.

01:15:03.060 --> 01:15:04.440
I will upload this clip

01:15:05.931 --> 01:15:07.540
and if you, and please.

01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:10.340
You have to find me and help me.

01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:12.287
I don't know what happened.

01:15:13.243 --> 01:15:15.303
I don't know what happened.

01:15:16.450 --> 01:15:20.300
They are everywhere around the house

01:15:21.531 --> 01:15:23.010
and they are killing people.

01:15:23.010 --> 01:15:25.793
They are running around and
they are killing people.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:28.833
So please.

01:15:30.213 --> 01:15:31.700
Help me.

01:15:31.700 --> 01:15:33.040
Help me.

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:33.873
Please.

01:15:41.653 --> 01:15:43.189
I.

01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:44.022
I'm.

01:15:46.570 --> 01:15:47.523
I, I.

01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:51.500
Please.

01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:52.963
Please help me.

01:17:01.245 --> 01:17:02.495
- Stupid bitch.

01:17:04.944 --> 01:17:07.027
You stupid fucking bitch.

01:17:23.704 --> 01:17:28.704
So, it has been 29 days since
this so called outbreak.

01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:32.000
I was gonna start this
video diary yesterday

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.173
but I thought someone may see me.

01:17:35.805 --> 01:17:36.960
There have been various reports

01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:39.080
of this so called infected

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:41.670
that since the television
stations went down.

01:17:41.670 --> 01:17:42.720
The ones around here.

01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:47.653
The ones around here are really fucked up.

01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:51.000
I mean, for one, they're
super intelligent.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:54.463
Well super intelligent
for raging lunatics.

01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:56.970
I mean they hunt in packs

01:17:56.970 --> 01:17:58.680
and they've got one or two scouts

01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:01.340
and they go round looking for victims

01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:02.600
and places to hunt.

01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:05.060
They set up camp on what was once

01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:06.683
a beautiful and quiet street.

01:18:09.570 --> 01:18:12.390
I was on a food run the other day

01:18:13.450 --> 01:18:14.750
and I saw a group of them.

01:18:16.410 --> 01:18:21.260
They got this guy that
was hiding out in a shed.

01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:24.803
Stand out is that once
they become infected,

01:18:26.125 --> 01:18:31.125
they have this bloody x starts
spreading across their face.

01:18:33.870 --> 01:18:35.490
I used to watch horror films

01:18:36.570 --> 01:18:38.313
but man, this was something else.

01:18:44.082 --> 01:18:46.749
I think that's enough for today.

01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:51.490
This is Georgia Romero reporting

01:18:51.490 --> 01:18:54.680
for the World is Fucked News.

01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:55.930
No one knew I lived here.

01:18:57.480 --> 01:18:59.540
I was kept in the back room.

01:18:59.540 --> 01:19:02.223
His precious little secret.

01:19:04.123 --> 01:19:05.980
I can't help but think

01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:09.370
that when they took him away,

01:19:09.370 --> 01:19:12.073
he finally got what he deserved.

01:19:12.970 --> 01:19:14.900
All those nights of drunken abuse

01:19:14.900 --> 01:19:16.773
paid back tenfold.

01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:24.113
Now all I've got to do,

01:19:25.130 --> 01:19:26.160
keep myself secret

01:19:31.965 --> 01:19:34.298
and I may just survive this.

01:19:38.664 --> 01:19:40.700
What a shitty time of year

01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:43.160
to have the zombie Apocalypse.

01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:44.593
Fucking Christmas.

01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:51.823
I'm going to show you how
to make the perfect omelet.

01:19:53.860 --> 01:19:56.880
So, there have been many arguments

01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:58.520
about choosing duck eggs

01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:01.980
but personally I prefer chicken.

01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:04.393
I think they just taste rich.

01:20:05.930 --> 01:20:07.460
Once the mixture hits the pan,

01:20:07.460 --> 01:20:09.140
it will have its underlying coat.

01:20:09.140 --> 01:20:13.900
Now is the prefect time to
add a fine mature cheddar.

01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:16.620
Grated, of course, add this to the mixture

01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:17.920
and it will start to melt.

01:20:19.688 --> 01:20:20.650
And there you have it.

01:20:20.650 --> 01:20:22.710
The prefect omelet.

01:20:22.710 --> 01:20:24.720
Next week, we do shark fin soup.

01:20:31.506 --> 01:20:32.339
man.

01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:34.233
I'm so hungry.

01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:45.377
Really do need to do a food run.

01:20:53.128 --> 01:20:53.961
Fuck it.

01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:03.510
I went on a food run last night

01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:09.763
and one of the x marked lunatics saw me.

01:21:10.770 --> 01:21:12.920
I mean I run back as fast I could

01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:14.793
but they're not fucking slow.

01:21:17.826 --> 01:21:18.676
On the plus side,

01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:24.143
I did find his secret stash of alcohol.

01:21:29.350 --> 01:21:31.057
Not like I can drink it though.

01:21:33.005 --> 01:21:33.838
I can't.

01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:39.097
Just can't.

01:21:49.309 --> 01:21:50.142
I had,

01:21:51.489 --> 01:21:52.322
I,

01:21:54.130 --> 01:21:56.547
I really want a cheeseburger.

01:21:59.570 --> 01:22:04.248
♪ Its the end of the world as we know it ♪

01:22:28.008 --> 01:22:30.091
I knew it was a bad idea.

01:22:31.017 --> 01:22:34.417
One of the x marked
psychos heard me last night

01:22:34.417 --> 01:22:35.840
and fucking broke in.

01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:38.060
Grabbed the empty vodka bottle

01:22:38.060 --> 01:22:41.420
I smashed his head with
it until it was muck

01:22:41.420 --> 01:22:43.830
and he was fucking laughing.

01:22:43.830 --> 01:22:45.520
What the fuck does that mean?

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:47.770
Is it spread by blood?

01:22:47.770 --> 01:22:49.223
Am I fucking infected?

01:22:50.130 --> 01:22:53.783
I fucking fought back
and that's what kills me?

01:22:57.192 --> 01:22:59.223
Its not fucking fair.

01:22:59.223 --> 01:23:00.950
I just wanted to be free.

01:23:02.829 --> 01:23:04.850
I just wanted to be free.

01:23:04.850 --> 01:23:06.350
Wanted to be free.

01:23:12.669 --> 01:23:13.752
Fucking free.

01:23:20.109 --> 01:23:21.526
I'm fucking free.

01:23:22.702 --> 01:23:24.119
I'm fucking free.

01:23:25.146 --> 01:23:26.563
I'm fucking free.

01:23:27.448 --> 01:23:28.865
I'm fucking free.

01:23:30.749 --> 01:23:32.166
I'm fucking free.

01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:45.807
- What the...

01:23:45.807 --> 01:23:47.446
You see her?

01:23:47.446 --> 01:23:48.279
Can you.

01:23:49.448 --> 01:23:50.700
- I wouldn't open that door man.

01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:51.533
I'm not opening that fucking door.

01:23:51.533 --> 01:23:52.510
- No.

01:23:52.510 --> 01:23:53.982
Well that fuckers so slow,

01:23:53.982 --> 01:23:54.815
we'll just go out there
and kill that motherfucker

01:23:54.815 --> 01:23:55.648
right now.

01:23:57.402 --> 01:23:59.819
- And his leg's broken.

01:24:01.147 --> 01:24:02.800
- That's even better.

01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:04.060
That's why I got a fucking baseball bat.

01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:06.290
You take out the other fucking leg.

01:24:06.290 --> 01:24:07.725
- We got to get that truck, man.

01:24:07.725 --> 01:24:08.985
- Alright.

01:24:08.985 --> 01:24:10.320
Alright.

01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:12.088
- Go help Joe.

01:24:12.088 --> 01:24:12.973
- Hey, where's Joe?

01:24:14.029 --> 01:24:15.138
- He's back that way somewhere.

01:24:15.138 --> 01:24:16.863
Oh he's over there.

01:24:16.863 --> 01:24:18.226
- You found the keys?

01:24:18.226 --> 01:24:20.968
- They may be in the office.

01:24:20.968 --> 01:24:22.630
- Alright.

01:24:22.630 --> 01:24:23.790
Oh a pole.

01:24:23.790 --> 01:24:25.982
Hey, you ladies want to
dance while we're going?

01:24:25.982 --> 01:24:27.580
Waiting up here?

01:24:27.580 --> 01:24:28.980
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:30.080
- Alright, cool.

01:24:31.870 --> 01:24:32.790
- Hey for real.

01:24:32.790 --> 01:24:33.930
Any girl want to get on the pole?

01:24:33.930 --> 01:24:36.045
- I know, seriously.

01:24:36.045 --> 01:24:37.980
- If.

01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:39.885
- I mean, we're gonna
have a whole lot of fun

01:24:39.885 --> 01:24:41.963
for 30 seconds.

01:24:46.700 --> 01:24:47.590
Yes, man.

01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:49.240
I'm putting this shit on YouTube.

01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:57.784
- Gonna mark the spot where
he can park at with the flare.

01:24:57.784 --> 01:24:59.117
- Alright.

01:25:02.322 --> 01:25:05.266
- We found a whip.

01:25:05.266 --> 01:25:06.503
- You found a whip?

01:25:06.503 --> 01:25:08.530
- We found a whip.

01:25:08.530 --> 01:25:09.430
- Hell yeah.

01:25:10.365 --> 01:25:14.264
- Who knew we'd
have some.

01:25:14.264 --> 01:25:15.805
- What you find over there?

01:25:15.805 --> 01:25:16.638
- Got some drinks.

01:25:16.638 --> 01:25:18.967
- Drinks, some soda and candy.

01:25:19.928 --> 01:25:21.506
- Oh candy.

01:25:21.506 --> 01:25:23.304
- And some popcorn.

01:25:23.304 --> 01:25:25.384
- Popcorn?

01:25:25.384 --> 01:25:26.493
Hell yeah.

01:25:26.493 --> 01:25:27.950
- Yeah not popcorn.

01:25:31.610 --> 01:25:33.122
- They moving yet?

01:25:33.122 --> 01:25:34.890
- Man, they still right there.

01:25:34.890 --> 01:25:37.581
Hopefully we can get
that damn thing started.

01:25:37.581 --> 01:25:39.110
- Oh shit.
- Ladies, ladies.

01:25:39.110 --> 01:25:40.183
Here he comes.

01:25:41.601 --> 01:25:43.240
- Alright, let's
get the last of the supplies

01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:44.323
and let's go.

01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:47.450
- Park it, park it, park it.

01:25:47.450 --> 01:25:49.060
Perfect.

01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:49.893
Right there.

01:25:53.618 --> 01:25:56.317
- Come on.

01:25:56.317 --> 01:25:57.778
- Come on hurry up.

01:25:57.778 --> 01:26:00.940
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

01:26:00.940 --> 01:26:01.933
- We're waiting.

01:26:03.207 --> 01:26:05.618
- Let's get the fuck in the truck!

01:26:05.618 --> 01:26:07.176
- Alright, alright come.

01:26:07.176 --> 01:26:08.317
Oh fuck.

01:26:08.317 --> 01:26:09.400
Who the fuck?

01:26:11.515 --> 01:26:12.514
- What the fuck is going on?

01:26:12.514 --> 01:26:13.515
- What's going on?

01:26:13.515 --> 01:26:14.514
- Get her, get her, get her.

01:26:14.514 --> 01:26:15.347
- What happened?

01:26:15.347 --> 01:26:17.180
- She got bit.

01:26:23.016 --> 01:26:24.413
- Fuck.
- Everybody get in the truck!

01:26:24.413 --> 01:26:26.496
- Come on, come on.

01:26:29.687 --> 01:26:30.870
- One, two, three.
- Go, go, go.

01:26:30.870 --> 01:26:32.988
Let's go, let's go.

01:26:32.988 --> 01:26:33.986
Come on everybody, in.

01:26:33.986 --> 01:26:35.576
In the truck.

01:26:35.576 --> 01:26:36.587
- Get in the truck.

01:26:36.587 --> 01:26:37.965
- Come on.
- come on.

01:26:37.965 --> 01:26:39.229
Fuck.

01:26:39.229 --> 01:26:40.442
Fucking shit.

01:26:40.442 --> 01:26:41.443
Fuck.

01:26:41.443 --> 01:26:43.943
I'm gonna check this shit out.

01:26:49.186 --> 01:26:50.466
Oh shit.

01:26:50.466 --> 01:26:51.946
- What the hell man?

01:26:51.946 --> 01:26:53.005
Come on.

01:26:53.005 --> 01:26:54.429
Come on.
- Fuck, fuck.

01:26:54.429 --> 01:26:55.262
Fuck.

01:26:57.208 --> 01:26:59.625
- Let's go, let's go.

01:27:08.610 --> 01:27:10.349
Something was wrong, let's go.

01:27:10.349 --> 01:27:11.730
- Come on.
- Come on.

01:27:11.730 --> 01:27:12.744
- We're sealed, we're sealed.

01:27:12.744 --> 01:27:13.577
Let's go.

01:28:14.610 --> 01:28:15.723
- I don't want to die alone.

01:28:30.030 --> 01:28:33.043
Nicki, if you ever see this.

01:28:35.933 --> 01:28:36.766
I.

01:28:40.989 --> 01:28:43.656
I was gonna ask you to marry me.

01:28:51.866 --> 01:28:52.699
I'm sorry.

01:28:56.749 --> 01:28:58.493
It won't stop bleeding.

01:28:58.493 --> 01:29:00.410
It won't stop bleeding.

01:29:01.249 --> 01:29:03.332
I don't want to die here.

01:29:05.512 --> 01:29:08.345
I'm finding out how to stay awake.

01:29:34.909 --> 01:29:36.576
The battery's going.

01:29:42.392 --> 01:29:43.225
Its.

01:29:45.053 --> 01:29:46.703
Really hard to keep my eyes open.

01:29:52.370 --> 01:29:54.103
The battery's going on the camera.

01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:57.050
I didn't think it last this long.

01:30:03.533 --> 01:30:08.200
Now its just a matter of which
one of us will die first.

01:30:10.310 --> 01:30:11.880
Me or the camera.

01:30:24.350 --> 01:30:26.350
- This week the world died.

01:30:26.350 --> 01:30:28.023
The world we know as is gone.

01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:32.630
Its been stolen from us in a flash.

01:30:32.630 --> 01:30:33.623
People said its,

01:30:35.150 --> 01:30:37.150
people say that there is no cure

01:30:37.150 --> 01:30:39.663
but I believe there will
be one in the future.

01:30:40.690 --> 01:30:42.020
I don't know if the people infected

01:30:42.020 --> 01:30:43.560
will be back to normal.

01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:44.393
Who knows.

01:30:45.373 --> 01:30:47.763
Do I want to live in a world like this.

01:30:50.690 --> 01:30:52.320
- I'm making this video

01:30:57.053 --> 01:31:02.053
to clear myself of any legal consequences

01:31:04.813 --> 01:31:07.453
for what I'm about to do.

01:31:12.632 --> 01:31:14.344
I don't know what else to do.

01:31:14.344 --> 01:31:16.677
I can't just leave her here.

01:31:22.712 --> 01:31:23.545
I.

01:31:25.992 --> 01:31:27.575
I can't just leave.

01:31:33.025 --> 01:31:35.048
I have to do it.

01:31:35.048 --> 01:31:36.965
I have to kill my wife.

01:31:44.691 --> 01:31:46.189
I have to show you.

01:31:46.189 --> 01:31:47.971
I'll show you.

01:31:47.971 --> 01:31:49.138
I'll show you.

01:32:11.309 --> 01:32:12.142
Laura?

01:32:17.570 --> 01:32:18.403
I have...

01:32:19.266 --> 01:32:20.599
I have to do it.

01:32:24.941 --> 01:32:26.017
Laura, say something.

01:32:27.288 --> 01:32:28.121
Laura.

01:33:21.190 --> 01:33:22.440
- Its been about a month.

01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:26.633
Since this whole thing has started.

01:33:32.190 --> 01:33:34.613
I was with a group for awhile but

01:33:37.949 --> 01:33:38.799
they're gone now.

01:33:43.690 --> 01:33:44.843
I found a cafe.

01:33:47.350 --> 01:33:48.763
What's left of one, anyway.

01:33:51.630 --> 01:33:53.630
There's some canned food out the back

01:33:53.630 --> 01:33:55.843
and a couch to sleep on.

01:33:58.248 --> 01:34:00.048
If sleep is even possible right now.

01:34:05.150 --> 01:34:06.723
The food should last me a week,

01:34:07.660 --> 01:34:08.493
maybe two.

01:34:10.850 --> 01:34:11.683
After that,

01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:15.370
I don't know.

01:34:18.381 --> 01:34:19.723
I guess I'll just keep moving.

01:34:28.060 --> 01:34:30.397
I don't know what happened.

01:34:32.823 --> 01:34:33.800
I mean, one day

01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:37.030
everything was normal

01:34:38.730 --> 01:34:39.580
and then the next

01:34:41.050 --> 01:34:42.950
there are these people

01:34:45.150 --> 01:34:46.300
but they're not people.

01:34:49.741 --> 01:34:50.824
They're dead.

01:34:58.365 --> 01:35:00.370
And the ones that are still alive,

01:35:00.370 --> 01:35:03.860
I mean they want to kill you anyway

01:35:03.860 --> 01:35:05.670
cause they either want your stuff

01:35:05.670 --> 01:35:08.373
or they just don't want
an extra mouth to feed.

01:35:14.184 --> 01:35:18.017
I guess its safe to say
that humanity is dead.

01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:21.713
So I might as well be, too.

01:35:30.630 --> 01:35:33.830
I don't even know if my
family is still alive

01:35:44.239 --> 01:35:47.560
and when I go outside I see these people

01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:48.937
that I went to school with

01:35:50.700 --> 01:35:52.250
but they're not people anymore.

01:36:15.020 --> 01:36:16.620
I hope someone finds this video.

01:36:20.670 --> 01:36:21.593
Cause if you do,

01:36:22.790 --> 01:36:24.040
then it means you made it

01:36:27.021 --> 01:36:28.763
and if you can make it through this,

01:36:30.350 --> 01:36:34.760
if you can make it through
the virus of the dead

01:36:39.690 --> 01:36:40.523
you'll be okay.

01:36:59.362 --> 01:37:00.402
- Hi.

01:37:00.402 --> 01:37:01.235
- Hi.

01:37:03.710 --> 01:37:04.543
- You okay?

01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:07.370
- No.

01:37:07.370 --> 01:37:10.130
But I don't want to talk about it.

01:37:10.130 --> 01:37:11.653
How's it going there?

01:37:13.810 --> 01:37:15.590
- A few of the villagers decided

01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:18.240
to look for a wild pig

01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:20.140
and some other food in the jungle

01:37:20.140 --> 01:37:22.320
but they haven't come back yet

01:37:23.670 --> 01:37:25.064
and then a few more

01:37:25.064 --> 01:37:27.380
decided to take the

01:37:27.380 --> 01:37:31.290
into town and we needed
fuel for the generator

01:37:33.581 --> 01:37:35.313
but its really quiet here.

01:37:36.580 --> 01:37:38.243
- Its been quiet here for days.

01:37:39.602 --> 01:37:42.040
There are fewer and fewer uploads

01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:44.473
on whatever's left of the internet.

01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:48.010
I heard some chatter about...

01:37:49.442 --> 01:37:52.002
- wait, babe what is that?

01:37:52.002 --> 01:37:53.085
What is that?

01:37:54.258 --> 01:37:55.341
Chris, Chris?

01:37:56.920 --> 01:38:00.700
(airplane flying overheard.

01:38:00.700 --> 01:38:02.143
- That, my love,

01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:06.633
is a motherfucking apache helicopter.

01:38:07.850 --> 01:38:09.807
Yeah, you know what that means?

01:38:09.807 --> 01:38:11.840
That means that somebody out there

01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:13.190
still has their shit together.

01:38:13.190 --> 01:38:14.023
- You think so?

01:38:15.417 --> 01:38:19.698
- Yes, yes we're gonna pull through this.

01:38:19.698 --> 01:38:20.718
We are gonna,

01:38:20.718 --> 01:38:21.551
and you're gonna come home.

01:38:21.551 --> 01:38:22.830
- I need to come home.

01:38:22.830 --> 01:38:24.763
I've been so scared.

01:38:25.922 --> 01:38:28.125
- Hey, babe, who's that behind you?

01:38:28.125 --> 01:38:29.421
- What's?

01:38:29.421 --> 01:38:30.461
Oh my god.

01:38:30.461 --> 01:38:31.341
- Stephanie, run.

01:38:31.341 --> 01:38:32.338
Run!

01:38:32.338 --> 01:38:33.341
Stephanie!
