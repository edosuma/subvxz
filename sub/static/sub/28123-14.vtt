is a Canadian prima donna

13:48.060 --> 13:50.290
who kept us all on our toes:

13:50.290 --> 13:52.360
Brooke Lynn Hytes.
Take a look, eh?

13:54.560 --> 13:56.530
[Brooke Lynn Hytes] Don't hate
me because I'm perfect.

13:56.530 --> 13:58.530

13:58.530 --> 14:00.270
Hate me because
I'm beautiful.

14:03.810 --> 14:05.740
There's a lot more to me
than meets the eye.

14:05.740 --> 14:08.580
I am bubbly, I'm excited.

14:08.580 --> 14:10.750
Nervous, creative.

14:10.750 --> 14:13.210
I'm not just
a cold-hearted bitch.

14:13.210 --> 14:15.220
I'm so much more.

14:20.420 --> 14:22.560
I started dancing
when I was 14 years old.

14:22.560 --> 14:24.360
Dancing ballet for so
many years professionally

14:24.360 --> 14:26.130
took such a toll
on my body that

14:26.130 --> 14:28.060
eventually I had to find
something new to do.

14:28.060 --> 14:29.400
And that's when
I discovered drag.

14:31.270 --> 14:33.070
I started doing drag
in the pageant world.

14:33.070 --> 14:34.740
Doing pageants and ballet,

14:34.740 --> 14:36.340
I learned how to be
very controlled

14:36.340 --> 14:39.110
and how to present myself
a certain way.

14:39.110 --> 14:40.610
And then I came to Drag Race,

14:40.610 --> 14:44.250
and I had to throw everything
I knew out the window.

14:44.250 --> 14:47.050
I started off really, really
strong in this competition.

14:47.050 --> 14:49.750
But I'm a perfectionist,
and every time I stumbled,

14:49.750 --> 14:51.290
it really threw me.

14:51.290 --> 14:52.690
One of the criticisms I got

14:52.690 --> 14:54.690
was that I wasn't willing
to let loose.

14:54.690 --> 14:57.460
So right now I'm just doing
whatever I can

14:57.460 --> 14:59.430
to get ready for this moment.

14:59.430 --> 15:01.430

-Okay.

15:06.430 --> 15:08.670
Maybe you've heard of
a little phrase called,

15:08.670 --> 15:10.170
"I love New York."

15:10.170 --> 15:11.540
"I love New York"?

to look messy.

But I'm willing to adapt.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.890

of the competition.

15:35.700 --> 15:37.430
I'm hitting the streets

15:37.430 --> 15:40.000
and learning to put
some "stank" on it,

15:40.000 --> 15:41.640

I needed to.

15:45.570 --> 15:48.340

I think someone peed there.

15:53.450 --> 15:55.320
I'm ready for the world.

15:55.320 --> 15:57.080
I love seeing my name

It's just me and that crown,
like a laser beam.

16:07.430 --> 16:10.360
And nothing is going to
distract me from my goal.

16:10.360 --> 16:12.400
Oh, look at the shoes, bitch!

16:12.400 --> 16:14.240

16:14.240 --> 16:15.770
During the course of
the competition,

16:15.770 --> 16:17.310
I have grown stronger.

16:17.310 --> 16:20.240
I have taken every failure
and I have learned from it.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.180
And it has made me
more and more fearless.

how's the Reverend Doctor
feeling tonight?

She's feeling
full of life, baby.

25:09.300 --> 25:10.400
[RuPaul] Oh, okay.

25:10.400 --> 25:11.440
Tell me this.

25:11.440 --> 25:14.310
How do you plan
on polishing off

25:14.310 --> 25:16.140
these other girls
in the competition?

25:16.140 --> 25:19.510
I just have to remember,
Silky, have fun.

25:19.510 --> 25:21.650
[RuPaul] Silky, have fun.
I like that.

25:21.650 --> 25:23.980
So, Silky, who's here
supporting you tonight?

25:23.980 --> 25:26.490
I have my beautiful mother

25:26.490 --> 25:28.260
and my inspirational
older brother.

25:28.260 --> 25:30.990
[RuPaul] Ahh. Hello.

25:30.990 --> 25:33.760
Now, what was Silky like
growing up with?

25:33.760 --> 25:36.160
Did you guys fight
or what was the relationship?

25:36.160 --> 25:38.730
Well, I was fine until 1989.

25:38.730 --> 25:41.570
Oh. What happened then?

25:41.570 --> 25:43.340
Silky was born.

25:43.340 --> 25:47.210
[laughter and applause]

25:51.410 --> 25:53.480
Bitch.

25:53.480 --> 25:56.780
[laughter and applause]

25:56.780 --> 25:58.720
Now, Mama Ganache,

25:58.720 --> 26:02.590
I heard that you had to explain
what Silky does for a living

26:02.590 --> 26:03.760
to your mother.

26:03.760 --> 26:05.060
How did you do that?

26:05.060 --> 26:06.330
What did you tell her?

26:06.330 --> 26:08.230
I told her that
you have to look at it

26:08.230 --> 26:10.230
like we got the best
of both worlds.

26:10.230 --> 26:11.700
I couldn't have
said it better myself.

26:11.700 --> 26:13.800
That's right.

26:13.800 --> 26:17.440
Now, Silky, any final words?

26:17.440 --> 26:18.670
I just want you all to know

26:18.670 --> 26:20.310
no matter how loud
people may say you are,

26:20.310 --> 26:22.710
how obnoxious
they may say you are,

26:22.710 --> 26:23.980
let your light shine.

what are you doing?

28:43.520 --> 28:45.750
I want to win
RuPaul's Drag Race,

28:45.750 --> 28:48.690
so I think y'all need to put my
face on the wheel, honey. Yes!

28:48.690 --> 28:51.020
Oh, my God.

28:51.020 --> 28:52.290
[cheers and applause]

28:52.290 --> 28:55.300
Darling, lover,
it's a little too late for that.

28:55.300 --> 28:56.730
[boos]

28:56.730 --> 28:59.130
It's late. I mean...

28:59.130 --> 29:01.570
I don't think
it's ever too late.

so I'm gonna show you.

to vote for me.

29:24.060 --> 29:26.160
Vote for what?
Where's the votes going?

29:26.160 --> 29:27.660
I don't even know.
But guess what?

29:27.660 --> 29:29.000
We gonna make it
to the finale.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.460
We need to get there.
Let's go!

29:30.460 --> 29:32.600
Baby, get off Grindr.

29:32.600 --> 29:34.000
Hi. How are you?

29:34.000 --> 29:35.340
Good. How are you?

29:35.340 --> 29:36.500
-You know who I am?
-I do know who you are.

29:36.500 --> 29:37.370
Good. Are you watching
the season?

29:37.370 --> 29:38.610
I am.

29:38.610 --> 29:40.470
-Are you Team Vanjie?
-I am.

You are fine as hell.

29:47.610 --> 29:48.650
Are you single or taken?

29:48.650 --> 29:50.180
I'm taken. I'm sorry.

29:50.180 --> 29:51.280
It don't even matter.

and your wife, me.

29:58.060 --> 29:59.090
Oh.

29:59.090 --> 30:00.760
Are you two devastated people

30:00.760 --> 30:02.430
because I'm not in the finale?

30:02.430 --> 30:03.660
Yes, exactly.

30:03.660 --> 30:05.400
I'm devastated.

30:05.400 --> 30:07.470
-So say "I was devastated."
-I was devastated.

30:07.470 --> 30:10.070
"I went into
a deep, deep dark depression

30:10.070 --> 30:11.370
at 11 years old, Ru."

30:11.370 --> 30:14.540
I went into
a deep, dark depression

30:14.540 --> 30:16.380
at 11 years old, Ru.

30:16.380 --> 30:18.650
And just make a sad face.

30:18.650 --> 30:21.680
Wrigley, do you think
that I was robbed on the show?

30:21.680 --> 30:23.580
Give Vanjie the crown.

30:23.580 --> 30:25.390
Do you want to see my face
on that wheel when they spin it?

30:25.390 --> 30:26.720
Yes.

30:26.720 --> 30:28.620
Put this face on the wheel.

30:28.620 --> 30:31.360
Do you think there's space
for five ho's on the wheel?

30:31.360 --> 30:33.230
No, there's only space for you.

30:33.230 --> 30:35.660
We don't even need the game.

30:35.660 --> 30:37.600
[cheers and applause]

30:37.600 --> 30:39.400
Don't mind me. I'm just here
in my natural habitat

30:39.400 --> 30:40.970
sitting on my royal throne.

30:40.970 --> 30:42.300

32:22.640 --> 32:25.370
Bye!

32:26.610 --> 32:29.310
Whoo!

32:29.310 --> 32:31.410
And now for something
completely different.

32:31.410 --> 32:33.580
This final top four contender

32:33.580 --> 32:37.220
puts the freak
in freakin' fabulous.

32:37.220 --> 32:39.420
Yvie Oddly.
Let's take a look.

32:43.460 --> 32:45.390
I'm not your typical queen.

32:45.390 --> 32:47.260
I've always been
a little bit different,

32:47.260 --> 32:49.060
but that's because
normal is boring.

32:49.060 --> 32:50.460
[laughs]

32:53.430 --> 32:55.800
It's people
who have different views

32:55.800 --> 32:58.170
and different aesthetics
and different feelings

32:58.170 --> 32:59.770
that really show us

32:59.770 --> 33:02.310
all the possibilities
of the human experience.

33:04.580 --> 33:06.450
I grew up a very artsy kid,

33:06.450 --> 33:08.320
and I was always
playing dress-up

33:08.320 --> 33:12.250
and making and creating things.

33:12.250 --> 33:14.750
So getting to do drag
and play dress-up

33:14.750 --> 33:18.160
as a career
is like so full circle.

33:18.160 --> 33:20.690
My parents don't really talk

33:20.690 --> 33:23.100
and haven't seen each other
for half a decade,

33:23.100 --> 33:24.970
but both of them support me.

33:26.670 --> 33:29.670
My dad, he's like fan-dad.

33:29.670 --> 33:31.100
He's got my T-shirts

33:31.100 --> 33:33.610
and he forces his whole
motorcycle club to watch,

33:33.610 --> 33:36.380
even if they're not
into that gay stuff.

33:36.380 --> 33:38.040
[laughs]

33:41.010 --> 33:43.280
When it comes to style,

33:43.280 --> 33:46.320
I've always gone for
alternative standards of beauty.

33:46.320 --> 33:48.120
I'm willing to push
the artform,

33:48.120 --> 33:50.090
push my peers,
and push myself

33:50.090 --> 33:51.790
to do things
we've never done before.

33:51.790 --> 33:55.530
And if my edges
are a little sharp, then...

33:55.530 --> 33:57.360
all the better
to cut you with, my dear.

34:04.100 --> 34:06.810
In preparing to get to
this stage of the competition,

34:06.810 --> 34:09.080
I'm working with
a professional spiritualist

34:09.080 --> 34:10.580
to try and find my Zen.

34:10.580 --> 34:14.280
You need to release your anger
and judgments.

34:14.280 --> 34:16.520
Your drag is tired,
you look old,

34:16.520 --> 34:18.590
and you're never gonna
make it to the finale.

34:18.590 --> 34:20.250
But at the end of the day,

34:20.250 --> 34:22.060
I'm still
an opinionated drag queen.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.560
That's not changing
any time soon.

34:27.130 --> 34:30.760
I spent a lifetime
honing a very bold voice,

34:30.760 --> 34:32.770
so I've been learning
how to communicate

34:32.770 --> 34:36.200
in a more approachable way.

34:36.200 --> 34:38.610
Everyone knows I know how
to stand out in a crowd.

34:38.610 --> 34:43.310
but I'm learning how to fit in
every now and then, too.

34:43.310 --> 34:45.150
I don't know why people
are so scared of me.

34:45.150 --> 34:47.150
Free hugs.

34:47.150 --> 34:49.050
Anyone?

34:49.050 --> 34:50.620
[laughs]

34:52.420 --> 34:54.390
I've dreamt about
winning this competition

34:54.390 --> 34:57.190
since I was 17,
since I saw Drag Race

34:57.190 --> 34:58.560
and was like, oh,
that where I need to be.

34:58.560 --> 35:00.760
And while my journey
hasn't been

35:00.760 --> 35:03.300
anything like what
I dreamt it would be,

35:03.300 --> 35:05.370
I'm still here
at the end of it,

35:05.370 --> 35:06.700
and I want this
to be a good dream.

35:06.700 --> 35:08.370
[laughs]

35:10.100 --> 35:12.270
Because I've always
been in a lot of pain

35:12.270 --> 35:14.670
and because
I've always had a limit

35:14.670 --> 35:17.740
on what my body can do
and how long it can do it for,

35:17.740 --> 35:19.580
I realize better than most

35:19.580 --> 35:21.750
the importance
of milking the now.

35:23.380 --> 35:25.220
I've had to overcome

35:25.220 --> 35:27.720
every single obstacle
that's been thrown at me,

35:27.720 --> 35:29.590
including the ones
I threw at myself,

35:29.590 --> 35:32.190
and I'm ready to leap
this final hurdle

35:32.190 --> 35:33.590
and finish in first.

35:33.590 --> 35:35.530
See you at the finale,
bitches.

to dominate

36:11.060 --> 36:13.170
the lip sync competition?

Well, now that I've shed

I mean,
not to be too cliche,

my heart on the stage,

-There they are.
-Oh, wow!

36:38.760 --> 36:40.190
Are you surprised to see them?

36:40.190 --> 36:42.730
Yeah, like sitting
right next to each other.

36:42.730 --> 36:45.330
[laughter]

36:45.330 --> 36:48.270
They haven't talked
in like five years.

Yes?

37:25.040 --> 37:27.570
Any final words?

37:27.570 --> 37:29.380
I know this journey
hasn't been

37:29.380 --> 37:32.610
like 100% pretty for me,

37:32.610 --> 37:36.080
but it feels so good
to be in the position I am

37:36.080 --> 37:39.490

37:56.300 --> 37:58.200
of RuPaul's Drag Race.

37:58.200 --> 38:01.740
Now put your hands together
for our top four queens!

38:01.740 --> 38:04.640
[cheers and applause]

38:06.450 --> 38:10.480
Ladies, you've waited
all season for this moment.

38:10.480 --> 38:13.090
But first,
to explain the rules

38:13.090 --> 38:16.260
of our lip sync smackdown
for the crown,

38:16.260 --> 38:19.460
I'm proud to present
one of LADP's finest.

38:21.230 --> 38:23.160
Hi, RuPaul.
It's Cheyenne.

38:23.160 --> 38:26.230
Or Officer Jackson,
if you're nasty.

38:26.230 --> 38:27.530
I'm here to explain

38:27.530 --> 38:29.670
how tonight's lip sync
smackdown for the crown

38:29.670 --> 38:31.340
is going to work.

38:31.340 --> 38:33.310
First, a spin
of the wheel determines

38:33.310 --> 38:36.680
which two sexy suspects
deliver an arresting performance

38:36.680 --> 38:39.210
in lip sync number one.

38:39.210 --> 38:40.350
After they're done,

38:40.350 --> 38:42.220
the remaining two
persons of interest

38:42.220 --> 38:45.290
compete in their own
lip sync faceoff.

38:45.290 --> 38:48.090
Then in the final round,
the two winning queens

38:48.090 --> 38:50.820
battle in the ultimate
lip sync for the crown.

38:52.660 --> 38:55.430
Bonus points
for a cooter slam.

38:55.430 --> 38:57.630
The winner receives a sentence

38:57.630 --> 39:01.700
of one year as America's
next drag superstar.

39:01.700 --> 39:03.100
By the way,

39:03.100 --> 39:04.270
I'm not wearing any pants.

39:07.010 --> 39:07.940
Back to you, Ru.

39:10.680 --> 39:13.580
Thank you, Officer Jackson.

39:13.580 --> 39:18.020
Now, on this wheel
are the faces of our top four.

39:18.020 --> 39:20.290
Where the wheel stops
will determine

39:20.290 --> 39:22.090
which queen lip syncs first.

39:22.090 --> 39:24.120
Ladies, ready?

39:24.120 --> 39:25.630
Yes.

39:25.630 --> 39:27.730
All right. Here we go.
I love this part.

39:38.440 --> 39:39.610
Oh, we're still going.

39:46.380 --> 39:47.950

39:52.350 --> 39:55.590
in tonight's first
lip sync for the crown.

39:55.590 --> 39:57.990
And now it's time to decide

39:57.990 --> 40:00.430
which queen

40:00.430 --> 40:03.560
you will lip sync against.

40:03.560 --> 40:05.100

in tonight's second lip sync

40:41.200 --> 40:42.500
coming up next.

40:42.500 --> 40:43.370
You may leave the stage.

it's your turn to choose.

-I am.
