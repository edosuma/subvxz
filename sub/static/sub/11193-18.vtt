WEBVTT

00:23.899 --> 00:26.443
(Daniel) Shouldn't they be here by now?

00:26.379 --> 00:27.797
(O'Neill) Yes.

00:28.338 --> 00:31.843
(Teal'c) I do not believe
the Tok'ra would mislead us.

00:31.739 --> 00:35.659
Assuming it was the Tok'ra who sent
the message to meet them here.

00:39.579 --> 00:45.335
On our radio frequency. Who else
would send us a signal like that?

00:45.898 --> 00:48.526
Y'know, I'm not real crazy about this...

00:48.457 --> 00:52.295
"Don't call us, we'll call you" policy.

01:20.334 --> 01:21.334
There!

01:35.932 --> 01:36.933
Cover up!

02:28.727 --> 02:30.312
Holy... buckets!

02:31.926 --> 02:32.926
Help me.

03:39.121 --> 03:40.121
Well!

03:42.319 --> 03:45.240
Whoa! Is that who I think it is?

03:45.520 --> 03:46.938
Tauri, please.

03:48.718 --> 03:53.974
Teal'c! Apophis is much more
valuable to us alive than dead.

04:01.518 --> 04:03.770
Sir, we've got incoming!

04:09.516 --> 04:10.516
Oy!

04:11.317 --> 04:14.987
All right, dial us up. Get us outta here.

04:20.317 --> 04:26.156
- What are they doing?!
- (Teal'c) They wish to take Apophis alive.

04:48.314 --> 04:49.314
Agh!

04:56.312 --> 04:59.733
- Colonel?
- General Hammond, Apophis.

05:00.713 --> 05:03.048
Apophis! General Hammond.

05:05.512 --> 05:06.596
We've met.

05:07.112 --> 05:08.781
I demand Kal mah!

05:11.432 --> 05:13.367
I'm not really sure,
but I think he's asking for...

05:13.310 --> 05:14.396
Sanctuary.

05:15.110 --> 05:16.110
Right.

05:19.430 --> 05:20.430
Why?

05:21.110 --> 05:23.988
I think some rival Goa'uld
just kicked his ass.

05:23.910 --> 05:28.247
There were several other death gliders
in pursuit, sir.

05:28.110 --> 05:29.776
I demand Kal mah!

05:29.709 --> 05:34.047
You're not in a position to demand
anything, sir. Lock him up.

05:33.909 --> 05:40.334
Sir, with respect, he is badly injured.
We need to get him into the OR right now.

05:40.108 --> 05:44.237
Do what you need to keep him alive,
Doctor. We've got a lot of questions.

05:44.108 --> 05:45.944
Yes, sir. OK, let's move him.

05:45.908 --> 05:49.411
I'm gonna start him on two IVs. Let's go!

05:49.307 --> 05:51.978
I want four SFs posted at all times.

05:51.908 --> 05:58.915
If he tries to escape, you're authorised
to do whatever is necessary to stop him.

06:03.906 --> 06:06.576
We'll debrief at 1100 hours.

06:08.105 --> 06:09.106
Yes, sir.

06:17.103 --> 06:19.582
(Fraiser) Both femurs were smashed
and there was internal bleeding.

06:19.504 --> 06:22.800
Surgery and transfusions
have stabilised him.

06:22.704 --> 06:25.582
His Goa'uld symbiote
will repair those injuries.

06:25.504 --> 06:30.050
It's kept him alive so far, Teal'c,
but... take a look at this.

06:29.903 --> 06:33.615
What you're looking at is the symbiote
attached to the host's brainstem.

06:33.502 --> 06:35.129
D'you see all these lesions?

06:35.103 --> 06:37.980
There's dozens.
I can treat the human part...

06:37.903 --> 06:42.658
but as for the symbiote itself...
- There is no treatment.

06:42.502 --> 06:44.336
He's been tortured.

06:50.302 --> 06:51.302
Sam?

06:52.300 --> 06:55.596
I... I just had a memory of... of Jolinar.

06:55.500 --> 06:59.254
Pain...
When she was killed by the Ashrak.

07:01.100 --> 07:03.769
The Ashrak had this device.
He used it on us.

07:03.699 --> 07:07.120
It was meant to cause incredible pain.

07:07.940 --> 07:11.444
Apophis was tortured by the same thing.

07:17.980 --> 07:20.149
- So he's dying?
- Yes.

07:20.579 --> 07:22.747
You're sure about that?

07:22.699 --> 07:26.786
As sure as I can be, sir, considering
what we know of Goa'uld physiology.

07:26.658 --> 07:27.658
Good!

07:28.538 --> 07:29.538
When?

07:30.536 --> 07:35.668
Without access to a sarcophagus, the
Goa'uld body will continue to deteriorate.

07:35.497 --> 07:38.042
So we're looking at days...
weeks, certainly.

07:37.976 --> 07:41.480
This torture wasn't designed
to extract information.

07:41.377 --> 07:43.879
It's a method of execution.

07:44.976 --> 07:46.269
So what does he really want?

07:46.255 --> 07:49.552
You heard him yourself.
He wants sanctuary.

07:49.456 --> 07:51.292
I'm not buying that.

07:51.254 --> 07:54.968
He gambled we would show compassion
even to our worst enemy.

07:54.855 --> 07:56.189
He was right.

07:58.095 --> 08:00.430
You think he orchestrated this?

08:00.375 --> 08:01.959
Let me tell you something.

08:01.935 --> 08:06.649
The only compassion I showed
was by not blowing his head off.

08:06.494 --> 08:07.202
I have witnessed...

08:07.214 --> 08:11.636
once powerful Goa'uld enter the service
of their conquerors in exchange for life.

08:11.494 --> 08:15.915
When Apophis was the conqueror, he
enjoyed seeing his enemies so weakened.

08:15.773 --> 08:17.733
We're a long way
from being his conquerors.

08:17.692 --> 08:21.947
But we are greatly responsible
for his downfall.

08:21.973 --> 08:24.685
He lost an army when you destroyed
those two ships in orbit.

08:24.612 --> 08:28.867
Bra'tac said that weakened his place
among the Goa'uld System Lords.

08:28.733 --> 08:31.735
His blood is in the water
and the sharks have a feeding frenzy.

08:31.651 --> 08:33.946
And he has come here seeking refuge.

08:33.890 --> 08:35.725
Well, that's tough!

08:36.211 --> 08:41.259
I say we beat whatever information
we can out of old snake-boy...

08:41.091 --> 08:42.110
and toss him back to the sharks.

08:42.090 --> 08:43.508
(Hammond) Not so fast, Colonel.

08:43.490 --> 08:49.245
He's essentially a prisoner of war.
That gives him certain rights.

08:50.370 --> 08:51.955
Rights, General?

08:52.250 --> 08:55.336
We also have to consider the host.

08:55.769 --> 08:59.106
I'm sorry, sir, but we are dealing with
two beings within one body.

08:59.009 --> 09:01.553
The symbiote may be an enemy,
but the host is innocent.

09:01.489 --> 09:05.994
Oh, come on! How much of the host
do you think is still around?

09:05.847 --> 09:07.682
Apophis will have that knowledge.

09:07.648 --> 09:10.902
We also need to consider
military intelligence.

09:10.807 --> 09:13.561
I informed my superiors of our situation.

09:13.488 --> 09:16.533
My orders are to extract
whatever information we can...

09:16.447 --> 09:20.159
in the short time we may have.
- He will tell you nothing, General.

09:20.047 --> 09:23.174
If he believes
it's in his own interest, he might.

09:23.086 --> 09:27.256
We are the only thing between him
and whatever Goa'uld was after him.

09:27.125 --> 09:30.963
We need answers.
Let me know when he's conscious.

09:30.845 --> 09:33.932
I'll tell you when
he's ready for questioning, sir.

09:33.846 --> 09:34.929
Dismissed.

09:41.963 --> 09:42.963
Sir?

09:45.563 --> 09:47.567
I should've shot him.

10:04.123 --> 10:06.625
Doctor Fraiser, he's awake.

10:14.442 --> 10:16.193
Not so close, doc!

10:18.241 --> 10:22.078
He's not strong enough
to hurt me, Colonel.

10:23.200 --> 10:25.451
He wants to talk to you.

10:39.278 --> 10:41.197
(distorted) O'Neill.

10:43.158 --> 10:44.326
I am dying.

10:46.438 --> 10:48.691
My heart bleeds for you.

10:49.078 --> 10:50.580
You lie poorly.

10:53.119 --> 10:55.788
It is you who have done this.

10:56.076 --> 10:57.328
You rejoice.

10:58.397 --> 11:01.066
Not really. What do you want?

11:01.116 --> 11:02.116
To live.

11:03.517 --> 11:05.351
Can't help you there.

11:05.317 --> 11:08.236
That's between you and your god.

11:09.155 --> 11:10.908
Oh, wait a minute!

11:11.755 --> 11:13.423
You are your god!

11:15.236 --> 11:16.904
That's a problem.

11:18.275 --> 11:21.153
I am worth far more to you
than you will admit.

11:21.075 --> 11:23.952
- You tell me, what are you worth?
- Your people...

11:23.875 --> 11:27.462
they are still primitive.
You will be destroyed.

11:27.355 --> 11:29.273
You're not up to it.

11:29.913 --> 11:30.913
Not me.

11:33.273 --> 11:36.192
- There is another.
- Yeah? Who?

11:37.354 --> 11:41.357
There is much you would
learn from me, Tauri.

11:46.072 --> 11:49.659
But for that knowledge there is a price.

11:51.912 --> 11:53.080
A new host.

11:54.392 --> 11:55.392
A host?

11:56.231 --> 11:58.067
So that I may live.

11:58.511 --> 12:02.307
In exchange for
all the knowledge of the Goa'uld.

12:02.191 --> 12:04.943
The secrets of star travel...

12:05.071 --> 12:06.740
our weapons...

12:07.110 --> 12:08.195
our power.

12:08.191 --> 12:09.192
All that?

12:09.750 --> 12:11.168
In time, more.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.038
Go to hell.

12:19.428 --> 12:23.517
A single human life is worth so much
you would risk a world?

12:23.389 --> 12:24.722
That's right.

12:25.269 --> 12:28.690
That's why they call us the good guys.

12:30.988 --> 12:31.988
Doc...

12:33.227 --> 12:35.730
let me know when he dies.

12:36.907 --> 12:37.907
What?

12:41.027 --> 12:43.947
An ancient and powerful Goa'uld.

12:44.586 --> 12:47.923
You have helped him to become strong.

12:48.307 --> 12:52.311
The last of my loyal Jaffa
died stealing me from his grasp.

12:52.187 --> 12:55.273
He will not rest until I am found.

12:55.466 --> 12:58.469
That is why I chose to come here.

12:58.826 --> 13:03.998
So that, in death,
I would be assured you will die with me.

13:12.183 --> 13:15.437
Sokar is a Goa'uld of ancient times.

13:15.664 --> 13:20.003
He was ruler of the System Lords, but
was defeated by an alliance of Goa'uld.

13:19.864 --> 13:21.948
Apophis and Ra were his conquerors.

13:21.903 --> 13:25.615
- Where did he go?
- Apophis himself believed him destroyed.

13:25.503 --> 13:27.087
Obviously, he was mistaken.

13:27.062 --> 13:32.067
Well, if he was almost wiped out,
how bad could he be now?

13:31.902 --> 13:34.154
It's rhetorical, Teal'c.

13:34.701 --> 13:36.513
(Daniel) His name's very old
in Earth mythology.

13:36.461 --> 13:41.466
He was the most feared deity in
ancient Egypt-the original god of death.

13:41.301 --> 13:43.261
Got anything a little more up to date?

13:43.221 --> 13:48.101
I don't know what he's been up to lately,
but... there was a time he ruled Earth.

13:47.941 --> 13:50.527
His lands near Memphis
were covered by darkness...

13:50.461 --> 13:53.297
and inhabited by... serpents.

13:54.740 --> 13:57.951
Unas. The first hosts of the Goa'uld.

13:57.859 --> 14:00.778
(Daniel) Well, that makes sense.

14:01.259 --> 14:01.842
If the Unas were the first ones...

14:01.859 --> 14:05.321
there had to have been a time when
both forms of Goa'uld host coexisted.

14:05.220 --> 14:08.932
- Kind of like Neanderthal...
- Which is he?

14:08.820 --> 14:09.946
I don't know.

14:09.938 --> 14:15.235
But his portion of Tuat, or the Otherworld,
was filled with lakes of fire.

14:15.058 --> 14:20.355
The wicked were thrown in as
punishment, after torture and mutilation.

14:20.177 --> 14:21.177
Hell.

14:22.857 --> 14:26.361
Yeah. Basically,
he was the original Satan.

14:26.255 --> 14:28.591
Well! Isn't that special!

14:29.057 --> 14:31.559
- (PA) Incoming traveller.
- (Stargate alarm)

14:31.496 --> 14:33.331
Speak of the devil!

14:40.336 --> 14:43.423
- Lieutenant Simmons!
- There are no units offworld.

14:43.334 --> 14:46.004
- Close the iris.
- Yes, sir.

14:48.254 --> 14:49.173
Go, go, go!

14:49.173 --> 14:49.884
Move it!

14:49.894 --> 14:50.894
Let's go!

14:57.453 --> 14:58.788
On the alert!

15:15.331 --> 15:17.375
Is there any way to determine
what that was?

15:17.331 --> 15:21.043
We can get a radiation team
to check the decay signature on the iris.

15:20.932 --> 15:22.392
I'm on it, Captain.

15:22.371 --> 15:24.957
Radiation team to gate room.

15:25.250 --> 15:28.004
Sir, I'd like to get back
to the interrogation, if I might.

15:27.931 --> 15:29.765
- OK.
- Sir, I'm...

15:30.090 --> 15:36.346
the expert on Sokar around here.
I'd like a shot at the interrogation.

15:36.489 --> 15:37.990
Yeah. Go ahead.

15:58.368 --> 15:59.952
Is he conscious?

16:00.807 --> 16:03.143
(distorted) Come, Daniel.

16:16.846 --> 16:18.514
You know my name?

16:18.765 --> 16:21.852
Because of what we hold in common.

16:22.164 --> 16:23.917
Amaunet, my queen.

16:26.684 --> 16:28.520
Her name is Sha're.

16:28.524 --> 16:30.025
She is my wife.

16:31.485 --> 16:33.111
They are one and the same.

16:33.085 --> 16:37.005
Amaunet possesses her.
Sha're is a prisoner.

16:37.004 --> 16:40.801
But she is somewhere.
I want you to tell me where.

16:40.683 --> 16:41.768
Amaunet...

16:43.764 --> 16:45.014
I loved her.

16:46.802 --> 16:48.888
You do not believe me?

16:49.562 --> 16:50.813
No. No, I...

16:52.243 --> 16:55.495
- I don't think that's possible.
- How could you?

16:55.402 --> 16:56.736
Our minds...

16:57.042 --> 16:58.876
our knowledge...

16:58.841 --> 17:00.469
our very being is so much greater...

17:00.442 --> 17:01.942
so much more.

17:04.361 --> 17:06.864
I know where your child is.

17:11.441 --> 17:12.441
My son?

17:13.440 --> 17:14.440
Yes.

17:14.760 --> 17:17.512
I brought him into the world
with my own hands...

17:17.439 --> 17:20.526
on Abydos.
- He was taken by Heru-ur.

17:20.441 --> 17:21.441
No.

17:23.039 --> 17:24.039
By me.

17:30.278 --> 17:33.198
I have no use for the child now.

17:36.478 --> 17:37.561
Amaunet...

17:39.597 --> 17:45.520
I knew the moment I laid eyes on her
she was the vessel for a queen.

17:46.717 --> 17:50.136
(whispers) If you don't tell me
where she is...

17:50.037 --> 17:52.539
I'll kill you right here.

17:53.916 --> 17:58.005
You have neither the strength...
nor the will.

17:59.315 --> 18:00.315
Daniel.

18:19.593 --> 18:23.056
We... We think that thud we heard
hitting the iris was a Sagan box.

18:22.952 --> 18:30.044
Its radioactive signature matches the one
we gave the Tok'ra. They're coming here.

18:33.913 --> 18:35.455
Incoming traveller.

18:35.432 --> 18:37.268
Decision time, sir.

18:37.551 --> 18:39.680
Captain Carter, are you 100%/% certain?

18:39.632 --> 18:42.760
That the signature matches the one
we gave the Tok'ra? Yes, sir.

18:42.672 --> 18:45.173
That it came from them? No.

18:45.432 --> 18:48.852
What if one or more of the Tok'ra have
been captured by Sokar and tortured?

18:48.750 --> 18:51.086
I don't think that they would give us up.

18:51.030 --> 18:55.202
I'm with Carter, General.
I say we keep the door open.

18:55.068 --> 18:56.153
Very well.

19:08.989 --> 19:09.990
Samantha.

19:10.269 --> 19:11.269
Martouf.

19:13.147 --> 19:16.152
Defence team, you may stand down.

19:16.827 --> 19:21.040
I offer you greetings from
the High Council of the Tok'ra.

19:20.907 --> 19:22.241
Why didn't my father come?

19:22.228 --> 19:26.398
He's dealing with more urgent matters.
We come to offer you a word of warning.

19:26.268 --> 19:27.269
Which is?

19:28.667 --> 19:30.795
We know you have Apophis
as your prisoner.

19:30.747 --> 19:36.752
You must return him to the planet
you retrieved him from immediately.

19:55.224 --> 19:59.855
Since Jacob has joined the Tok'ra,
I have come to a deeper understanding...

19:59.704 --> 20:04.751
of your people, your purpose,
and your extraordinary gifts.

20:04.584 --> 20:05.667
Thank you.

20:05.863 --> 20:10.911
You have shown skill and cunning in
taking Apophis from the hands of Sokar.

20:10.741 --> 20:11.367
However...

20:11.383 --> 20:15.804
You know, as much as I love
where you're going with this, we...

20:15.663 --> 20:17.999
didn't exactly do that.

20:18.781 --> 20:21.786
Our operatives aboard Sokar's vessel...

20:21.701 --> 20:24.121
witnessed you leave the crash site
and enter the Stargate.

20:24.061 --> 20:29.442
We received a signal. A set of
coordinates. We thought it was from you.

20:29.260 --> 20:33.098
- We sent no such signal.
- We know that now.

20:32.980 --> 20:33.981
Then who?

20:35.299 --> 20:38.636
We're going to assume it was Apophis.

20:42.099 --> 20:46.145
(distorted) Why would he take refuge
among the Tauri? He despises you.

20:46.019 --> 20:47.896
And you have nothing of use to him.

20:47.858 --> 20:52.280
He's goin' down.
And he wants to take us with him.

20:52.778 --> 20:55.031
He has taken advantage
of your weakness.

20:54.979 --> 20:57.606
We don't consider what we did
a sign of weakness.

20:57.538 --> 20:59.373
Then you are fools.

21:01.138 --> 21:03.892
Turn him over to Sokar now
and he may spare you.

21:03.818 --> 21:10.076
- I'm afraid we can't do that just yet.
- If he remains here, you will all die.

21:09.856 --> 21:11.108
If not by the hand of Sokar...

21:11.096 --> 21:16.269
then by the many Goa'uld
who wish to destroy Apophis themselves.

21:16.096 --> 21:18.682
You do not see what you have done.

21:18.615 --> 21:21.702
You have entered a battle
you are ill-equipped to fight...

21:21.615 --> 21:23.616
tipped the balance of power
among the Goa'uld...

21:23.575 --> 21:26.952
and worsened the fortune of your race.

21:26.855 --> 21:27.981
We must know...

21:27.976 --> 21:31.855
what would happen to him
if we turned him over.

21:31.734 --> 21:34.070
I am certain he would be executed.

21:34.015 --> 21:35.182
Eventually.

21:36.454 --> 21:37.205
I see.

21:37.413 --> 21:39.249
Surely you welcome this.

21:39.213 --> 21:43.009
His guilt is clear. He cannot
be allowed to escape punishment.

21:42.894 --> 21:44.895
He won't. He's dying.

21:47.573 --> 21:48.824
You are certain of this?

21:48.814 --> 21:52.943
Yes. His body has begun to age
at an increasing rate.

21:52.813 --> 21:56.984
Without a sarcophagus
to rejuvenate him, of course.

21:56.853 --> 21:59.440
In the short time he has remaining...

21:59.372 --> 22:03.250
we may yet learn information
that could help us to defend ourselves.

22:03.132 --> 22:07.261
Your knowledge is too primitive
for such information to be of any use.

22:07.131 --> 22:11.051
Don't you comprehend
the danger you are in?!

22:11.691 --> 22:14.611
We cannot defend you from the Goa'uld.

22:14.530 --> 22:16.366
You cannot expect us to.

22:16.330 --> 22:17.332
We don't.

22:20.290 --> 22:23.377
Overconfidence was theirfailing, O'Neill.

22:23.288 --> 22:26.542
I hope it has not also become yours.

22:36.367 --> 22:38.162
(undistorted) Forgive Lantash.

22:38.130 --> 22:41.967
He is sometimes passionate
in his opinions.

22:44.847 --> 22:48.394
(sighs) We cannot and would not
force you to do anything.

22:48.288 --> 22:52.416
But since we have not convinced you
of the danger you face...

22:52.287 --> 22:53.954
may we see him?

23:09.685 --> 23:13.190
- What is that you're injecting into him?
- Morphine sulphate.

23:13.085 --> 23:16.255
- To ease the pain.
- You said he had been tortured.

23:16.164 --> 23:19.669
He's also experiencing withdrawal
symptoms from the sarcophagus.

23:19.565 --> 23:22.276
- But he is your enemy.
- He is my patient.

23:22.203 --> 23:23.203
Amaunet!

23:24.042 --> 23:26.046
- Apophis, hear me.
- Amaunet!

23:26.002 --> 23:29.257
- I would speak with you.
- Amaunet!

23:30.003 --> 23:31.003
My love!

23:33.282 --> 23:34.701
Where are you?

23:51.402 --> 23:55.823
That's ancient Egyptian.
This... must be the host.

23:59.601 --> 24:00.852
Talk to him.

24:03.599 --> 24:05.935
I don't know what to say!

24:17.479 --> 24:19.415
Thousands of years,
trapped inside your own body...

24:19.358 --> 24:21.111
It's unimaginable.

24:22.998 --> 24:25.959
He won't be conscious again for a while.

24:25.877 --> 24:30.215
Then we will take our leave of him.
I will tell you the coordinates to send us.

24:30.077 --> 24:33.498
We can question him together.
We can share any information we get.

24:33.396 --> 24:36.567
- (PA) Incoming traveller.
- (Stargate alarm)

24:36.477 --> 24:40.564
- (O'Neill) Expecting someone?
- (Martouf) No.

24:43.395 --> 24:45.272
Defence teams, stand by.

24:45.236 --> 24:48.489
- Keep that iris closed.
- Yes, sir.

24:55.993 --> 24:57.913
Sokar has found you.

24:58.714 --> 24:59.298
How?

24:59.513 --> 25:02.976
His pilots saw you flee
through the Chaapa-ai.

25:02.874 --> 25:07.711
The symbols of the Tauri
are well known by the Goa'uld.

25:09.634 --> 25:11.553
That iris will hold.

25:12.393 --> 25:14.061
(Carter) It's a trinium titanium alloy.

25:14.034 --> 25:20.540
Just a few microns from the event
horizon. It won't let matter reintegrate.

25:20.751 --> 25:22.921
Something is appearing.

25:25.832 --> 25:27.834
How is this possible?

25:28.471 --> 25:30.574
The space between your metal barrier
and the wormhole...

25:30.511 --> 25:33.807
may be enough for particles
of high energy to reintegrate.

25:33.711 --> 25:36.382
- Subatomic particles?
- Yes.

25:36.990 --> 25:41.494
He's firing a particle accelerator
at the wormhole?

25:41.750 --> 25:42.586
Captain?

25:42.589 --> 25:46.302
Sir, we may be seeing
the decay of subatomic particles...

25:46.190 --> 25:48.151
as they bombard the iris.

25:48.109 --> 25:51.279
Small enough to reintegrate,
but moving at near light velocities.

25:51.189 --> 25:55.068
If Sokar can modulate
the particle stream enough...

25:54.949 --> 25:57.868
(distorted) People of the Tauri.

25:59.548 --> 26:02.134
You have taken what is mine.

26:02.548 --> 26:05.384
For this you will be destroyed.

26:09.788 --> 26:11.539
The iris is beginning to heat up, sir.

26:11.507 --> 26:12.884
How long can they maintain this?

26:12.867 --> 26:16.579
The longest Goa'uld attack
against an iris was 38 minutes.

26:16.467 --> 26:20.011
We think that's the maximum
a wormhole can be maintained.

26:19.906 --> 26:23.286
They'll dial us up
and do this all over again.

26:23.186 --> 26:24.730
This changes things.

26:24.705 --> 26:28.586
I'd better get on the phone
with the President.

26:28.464 --> 26:31.885
- Can you help us?
- I know of no way.

26:33.105 --> 26:37.652
In the meantime, Carter, why don't
you see what you can get out of Apophis?

26:37.505 --> 26:39.965
His neck's on the line here now, too.

26:39.903 --> 26:40.822
Yes, sir.

26:40.824 --> 26:42.826
I will accompany you.

26:51.064 --> 26:54.984
(distorted) I will not
speak to the Shol'va.

26:54.864 --> 26:56.531
Just answer this.

26:56.702 --> 27:01.291
Sokar is firing a particle beam at
the barrier we have within our Stargate.

27:01.142 --> 27:03.436
How do we defend against it?

27:03.382 --> 27:05.300
There is no defence.

27:05.501 --> 27:07.587
- He lies.
- Shol'va, kree!

27:07.541 --> 27:09.461
How can you be sure?

27:10.702 --> 27:14.123
Because he used the weapon against me.

27:15.340 --> 27:17.009
The pain returns!

27:20.181 --> 27:26.688
We're not gonna get anything out of him
in this state. I'll get Dr Fraiser.

27:36.338 --> 27:40.009
I have waited many years
for this moment.

27:40.019 --> 27:42.896
Do you think you have won, Teal'c?

27:42.817 --> 27:44.819
You are about to die.

27:45.417 --> 27:47.252
Perhaps that is so.

27:47.617 --> 27:50.454
But my people have won freedom.

27:50.458 --> 27:52.210
The Jaffa will never be free.

27:52.176 --> 27:54.346
They are free even now.

27:54.576 --> 27:55.576
As am I.

27:56.777 --> 27:58.445
Hear me, Apophis.

27:59.457 --> 28:03.211
This day will become
a holy day on Chulak.

28:03.257 --> 28:04.717
The day of your death.

28:04.695 --> 28:07.740
The larval Goa'uld you carry within you...

28:07.655 --> 28:11.076
is your master even now. All of you!

28:11.776 --> 28:15.195
And when the time comes for those
children to take a host, you will die!

28:15.095 --> 28:21.101
Then we will find other symbiotes,
then discard them when they mature.

28:20.894 --> 28:24.273
- We will use your kind as you used mine.
- No!

28:24.173 --> 28:30.097
The people of Chulak no longer
worship you. They no longer fear you.

28:30.894 --> 28:34.397
The time of Apophis
has finally come to an end.

28:34.292 --> 28:35.836
Then kill me now!

28:35.813 --> 28:38.732
Tell us how to defend ourselves.

28:44.051 --> 28:51.394
I will die with a smile on my lips, knowing
that you will die along with me, Shol'va.

28:54.612 --> 28:56.197
Come no further.

28:58.092 --> 28:59.593
Let him suffer.

29:01.730 --> 29:04.482
And when he can
stand the pain no more...

29:04.410 --> 29:09.332
he will tell us
how to defend ourselves against Sokar.

29:10.930 --> 29:13.098
Teal'c... please move.

29:14.609 --> 29:19.115
There was a time
when you would die for me, Teal'c.

29:24.008 --> 29:26.009
That time is no more.

29:31.846 --> 29:33.347
(Fraiser) Easy!

29:34.647 --> 29:35.647
Easy...

29:44.846 --> 29:48.099
All right. These shields of yours...

29:48.246 --> 29:53.501
They obviously absorb different forms
of energy. Maybe we...

29:55.765 --> 29:58.518
I sense a presence within you.

29:58.566 --> 30:01.652
Could your shields help us or not?

30:06.444 --> 30:09.781
You were once possessed by a Goa'uld.

30:11.563 --> 30:14.316
I'm sure you will make an excellent host...

30:14.243 --> 30:16.496
for Sokar's new queen.

30:20.962 --> 30:21.962
Airman!

30:24.843 --> 30:28.055
Pour it on, Sergeant!
It's getting damn hot in here!

30:27.961 --> 30:29.838
Better than nothing, sir.

30:29.801 --> 30:31.386
But not by much!

30:37.082 --> 30:41.461
General, Daniel just came up with
an idea that might buy us some time.

30:41.320 --> 30:45.241
Sir, if we can dial out, we can
prevent them from dialling in.

30:45.121 --> 30:48.625
Good thinking, Doctor.
If we can keep our gate open...

30:48.520 --> 30:52.357
- Coming up on 38 minutes, sir.
- Stand by.

30:54.079 --> 30:56.082
Go ahead. Dial it up.

31:01.959 --> 31:03.961
Chevron one, encoded.

31:09.798 --> 31:11.217
Chevron two...

31:12.278 --> 31:13.278
Encoded.

31:14.557 --> 31:16.059
The thing is...

31:17.797 --> 31:20.090
Incoming wormhole established.

31:20.037 --> 31:22.789
Sokar can dial in faster
than we can dial out.

31:22.717 --> 31:23.717
Dammit!

31:24.356 --> 31:27.109
Next window's 38 minutes away.

31:27.635 --> 31:31.223
That may be our last chance to dial out.

31:33.755 --> 31:36.008
It's gonna get hot, sir.

31:44.594 --> 31:48.973
Temperature in the gate room
now reads 130o Fahrenheit...

31:48.834 --> 31:52.046
which means the iris
must be six or eight times that.

31:51.952 --> 31:54.873
Even if he fails to breach the gate,
he will come by ship.

31:54.792 --> 32:00.007
Martouf is right. What we really need
to be concerned with is another assault.

31:59.833 --> 32:03.252
That's what we're inviting
by refusing to hand Apophis over.

32:03.153 --> 32:05.530
We couldn't now, even if we wanted to.

32:05.471 --> 32:08.057
Not with Beelzebub
banging at the door, no.

32:07.992 --> 32:13.415
I've informed the President. Our new
orders are to cease medical intervention.

32:13.230 --> 32:18.362
- That will effectively end his life, General.
- I'm aware of that, Doctor.

32:18.192 --> 32:20.611
The President and Joint Chiefs
have decided that...

32:20.550 --> 32:24.346
the risks are too great
not to heed the Tok'ra's warning.

32:24.230 --> 32:25.648
Our orders are to send...

32:25.631 --> 32:29.469
Apophis's body back through the gate
to the coordinates...

32:29.351 --> 32:31.434
where you found him.

32:31.349 --> 32:34.394
Will that make Sokar
cease his attack, Martouf?

32:34.309 --> 32:36.561
Sokar is at war with Heru-ur.

32:36.509 --> 32:39.430
He wants no part of the Tauri
for the moment.

32:39.349 --> 32:42.144
But you may have
come to your senses too late.

32:42.067 --> 32:43.778
He will soon burn through your iris.

32:43.748 --> 32:46.250
I've thought of a way to dial out faster.

32:46.188 --> 32:50.692
If we open our gate in the next window,
we can send Apophis through.

32:50.548 --> 32:53.218
- When is that?
- 17 minutes.

32:54.468 --> 33:00.474
Colonel, make arrangements to send
Apophis back through the Stargate.

33:11.945 --> 33:12.945
Apophis.

33:15.226 --> 33:17.394
We're sending you back.

33:24.744 --> 33:26.998
(undistorted) See-mu-we.

33:28.545 --> 33:29.628
See-mu-we.

33:31.304 --> 33:33.973
Get Doctor Jackson down here.

33:42.423 --> 33:46.344
I can't keep those men in there
much longer.

33:46.461 --> 33:50.549
They've gotta stay
until the next window, sir.

34:03.741 --> 34:05.786
He says he's been in an unending dream.

34:05.740 --> 34:10.996
He hoped to awaken from it
to see his wife and his children.

34:22.858 --> 34:26.445
He was a scribe
in the Temple of Amon at Karnak.

34:26.338 --> 34:32.679
But... that was another lifetime ago,
before the... before the nightmare.

34:39.657 --> 34:42.994
And now he awakens only to die again.

35:09.333 --> 35:13.463
I said I will speak the words of power
and do the rites.

35:13.333 --> 35:17.463
You will be returned to Egypt
and buried with honour.

35:17.333 --> 35:21.130
You will pass through the Seven Gates
and see your wife and children again...

35:21.012 --> 35:24.266
and... rejoice with them for ever.

35:27.572 --> 35:28.907
I'll be back.

35:39.610 --> 35:43.322
Sir, we're gonna lose the computers.
The heat...

35:43.211 --> 35:44.211
Captain?

35:45.012 --> 35:49.599
We need them, sir.
One more minute until the window.

35:56.048 --> 35:58.635
- (distorted) Help me.
- No.

36:00.768 --> 36:01.769
A host...

36:03.128 --> 36:04.128
No.

36:07.250 --> 36:08.250
I am...

36:10.449 --> 36:11.449
afraid.

36:20.967 --> 36:22.885
- (gasps)
- Colonel.

36:27.326 --> 36:28.994
The Goa'uld is dead.

36:28.965 --> 36:30.467
But the host...

36:31.365 --> 36:33.034
He's still alive.

36:36.965 --> 36:40.637
That's it. Initiate the dialling program.

36:41.445 --> 36:44.447
(Simmons) The program is running.

37:08.521 --> 37:11.733
I told him this funerary statue
would take his last breath...

37:11.643 --> 37:14.813
and carry his soul back to Egypt.

37:51.998 --> 37:53.708
Chevron seven locked.

37:53.679 --> 37:57.266
- Wormhole established.
- Open the iris.

38:09.317 --> 38:12.612
Captain Carter has created
an outgoing wormhole.

38:12.516 --> 38:17.271
- Sokar cannot attack during this time.
- That's good.

39:41.266 --> 39:43.353
- What now?
- We wait.

39:45.545 --> 39:49.132
If Sokar wanted him alive,
he'll just start up the attack again.

39:49.027 --> 39:50.862
No, I don't believe he will.

39:50.827 --> 39:54.581
Sokar has a sarcophagus
in his possession.

39:55.585 --> 40:02.342
He can revive Apophis, even from death,
and torture him as long as he pleases.

40:05.425 --> 40:08.429
Surely a fate he justly deserves.

40:17.025 --> 40:20.277
These are the coordinates
we would like you to send us.

40:20.184 --> 40:22.978
But not to anywhere
we'll be able to find you again.

40:22.903 --> 40:24.489
To contact us...

40:24.463 --> 40:28.050
you may use this.
- (Daniel) That's Tollen.

40:27.943 --> 40:30.570
- They use it to contact the Nox.
- (Martouf) Yes.

40:30.501 --> 40:33.838
We are friends of the Tollen.
And of the Tauri.

40:33.742 --> 40:34.827
Thank you.

40:35.382 --> 40:38.552
Well, if we're gonna be friends...

40:38.501 --> 40:40.963
you're gonna need one of these.

40:40.902 --> 40:42.320
It's called a GDO.

40:42.302 --> 40:46.639
It sends out a signal that lets us know who
you are and if it's OK to open the iris.

40:46.501 --> 40:50.922
Otherwise, you could end up
splattered against the... well...

40:50.780 --> 40:55.534
- I understand.
- Come on, I'll show you how it works.

40:56.500 --> 41:01.088
All right. Let's send them home, people.
