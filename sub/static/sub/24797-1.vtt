00:19.062 --> 00:21.649
Sure enough, right
back out he comes.

00:21.673 --> 00:23.782
Mmm, like father, like son.

00:33.337 --> 00:36.297
You're stuck in some
reverse cycle of doom.

00:37.646 --> 00:40.190
I get sleepy though, too...

00:40.214 --> 00:42.433
Shit!

01:15.901 --> 01:18.184
Is... is everyone all right?

01:18.208 --> 01:21.274
- Uh, yeah.
- Fine.

01:21.298 --> 01:24.147
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait
a second, sit down.

01:24.171 --> 01:25.800
- I just...
- Have a seat.

01:25.824 --> 01:27.150
Bumped my head, that's all.

01:27.174 --> 01:30.153
Have a seat. Okay?

01:30.177 --> 01:31.893
Is she okay?

01:31.917 --> 01:34.137
It'll leave a knot,
but she'll be okay.

01:49.761 --> 01:51.478
How's your neck?

01:51.502 --> 01:53.542
Just when we started to get
to know each other, too,

01:53.566 --> 01:55.134
I put you through a window.

01:55.158 --> 01:56.831
Hey, that's luck.

01:56.855 --> 01:58.118
I'm sorry.

01:59.162 --> 02:00.444
What do we have here?

02:00.468 --> 02:03.708
Here. Keep the swelling down.

02:03.732 --> 02:06.624
Okay, come on, guys, let's
give her some space.

02:06.648 --> 02:08.215
Not crowding.

02:12.219 --> 02:17.591
- You okay?
- Yeah, thanks.

02:21.402 --> 02:23.728
You know, I'm not sure
roadside assistance

02:23.752 --> 02:26.034
assists the middle of nowhere.

02:26.058 --> 02:27.993
Doesn't hurt to check.

02:28.017 --> 02:32.476
How long since the last time?
How long since the last car?

02:32.500 --> 02:35.609
How long since you
changed a tire?

02:35.633 --> 02:38.046
Ah, well, you have one,

02:38.070 --> 02:40.832
two, three capable
young men right here.

02:40.856 --> 02:42.225
- Ohh...
- Between the three of us,

02:42.249 --> 02:43.748
I'm pretty sure
we can handle it.

02:43.772 --> 02:46.316
Hear that, fellas? You
just got drafted.

02:46.340 --> 02:48.970
Slap the spare on,

02:48.994 --> 02:51.930
and it'll be back in
business in five minutes.

02:51.954 --> 02:53.236
Five minutes?

02:53.260 --> 02:55.020
Okay, ten.

02:55.044 --> 02:56.761
Fifteen maybe.

02:56.785 --> 02:58.154
Ten it is.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.112
- Uh, okay.
- Okay.

03:00.136 --> 03:04.096
5:12, it'll be here
before you know it.

03:10.233 --> 03:11.515
Sit right here.

03:11.539 --> 03:14.237
It's cold.

03:18.328 --> 03:19.436
Here.

03:19.460 --> 03:23.464
Feels good, if you ask me.

03:29.078 --> 03:31.491
What do we win?

03:31.515 --> 03:33.145
Bragging rights.

03:33.169 --> 03:34.842
That's all?

03:34.866 --> 03:37.280
In relationships?

03:37.304 --> 03:39.393
Dude, they're everything.

03:41.873 --> 03:44.156
Okay, okay, wait,
I can't resist.

03:44.180 --> 03:46.158
Everybody?

03:46.182 --> 03:48.116
Say "pit stop"!

03:48.140 --> 03:50.641
Pit stop!

03:52.580 --> 03:54.819
Okay, that's a good one.

03:54.843 --> 03:56.473
- Can you text me that?
- Uh, yeah.

03:56.497 --> 03:58.605
- Me, too.
- Ooh, yeah, one more.

03:58.629 --> 04:00.955
Here, just pass it around.

04:00.979 --> 04:03.547
I promise I won't share
your digits with Big Data.

04:06.463 --> 04:08.876
It's hot.

04:08.900 --> 04:11.338
Yep.

04:13.296 --> 04:15.646
- You okay? I'm sorry.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

04:16.865 --> 04:18.257
No, thanks.

04:21.086 --> 04:22.349
Yeah.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.506
And there you go.

04:29.530 --> 04:32.160
Awesome, thank you.
That everybody?

04:32.184 --> 04:33.814
Uh, change of heart.

04:33.838 --> 04:35.840
Go for it.

04:40.454 --> 04:41.822
Okie doke.

04:41.846 --> 04:43.781
Beep, beep, beep.

04:43.805 --> 04:46.610
See, we're already
halfway there.

04:53.205 --> 04:56.010
You, uh... you use
this one before?

04:56.034 --> 04:58.796
I don't recall. Why?

04:58.820 --> 05:00.256
The treads are worn.

05:01.736 --> 05:05.106
Worn, huh? Bad?

05:05.130 --> 05:07.108
We'd be taking our chances.

05:07.132 --> 05:10.310
Hold on a second.
Technical difficulties.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.813
Where are you off to?

05:15.837 --> 05:17.273
Walkabout.

07:07.470 --> 07:10.971
Hey, hey, hey, found a garage
about 20 minutes off route.

07:10.995 --> 07:13.800
Might be a good detour to
have a fresh tire put on,

07:13.824 --> 07:16.020
or at least get that
one patched up.

07:16.044 --> 07:17.848
Yeah, well, if this
spare decides to blow,

07:17.872 --> 07:19.806
we'll be begging for
them to come to us.

07:19.830 --> 07:21.199
If we can get anyone out here.

07:21.223 --> 07:23.506
Signal's got a mind of its own.

07:23.530 --> 07:27.031
Twenty minutes off route. Another
20 to get back on track.

07:27.055 --> 07:29.468
Let's say 15 to 30 at the shop.

07:29.492 --> 07:32.384
That's what, an hour and
change we're adding on?

07:32.408 --> 07:34.299
Yeah.

07:34.323 --> 07:38.259
Hey, what time did you say you
were hoping to pull in later?

07:38.283 --> 07:41.088
7:00.

07:41.112 --> 07:42.873
Any wiggle room?

07:42.897 --> 07:45.484
Surprise party birthday
for my sister.

07:45.508 --> 07:49.053
I'd like to be there to see
her face when she walks in.

07:49.077 --> 07:52.622
I'd like her to see
myface when she walks in.

07:52.646 --> 07:54.319
Close?

07:54.343 --> 07:56.843
Before college, yeah.

07:56.867 --> 07:58.976
Our age?

07:59.000 --> 08:01.369
Today's her sweet 16.

08:01.393 --> 08:04.111
Man...

08:04.135 --> 08:05.939
You... you gotta be there.

08:05.963 --> 08:07.463
If we need to stop,
we need to stop.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.465
It's better for me
to be a little late

08:09.489 --> 08:11.273
than all of us stranded.

08:50.355 --> 08:51.463
Do you mind?

08:51.487 --> 08:53.402
Nature calls.

09:00.017 --> 09:03.127
Say, you gotta be anywhere at,
like, a specific time tonight?

09:03.151 --> 09:04.998
Not really.

09:05.022 --> 09:07.182
'Cause I was thinking if it's
cool with everybody else,

09:07.206 --> 09:10.221
we could drop her off
and just double back.

09:10.245 --> 09:12.245
I don't want everyone to
have to change their plans

09:12.269 --> 09:14.878
- on my account.
- I don't have any plans.

09:14.902 --> 09:17.097
Me neither, not till tomorrow.

09:17.121 --> 09:18.621
No worries.

09:18.645 --> 09:20.100
Probably add another hour.

09:20.124 --> 09:22.276
But we'd have enough
time to fix the tire

09:22.300 --> 09:25.279
and get you to your
sister's on time.

09:25.303 --> 09:27.412
And works for us.

09:27.436 --> 09:30.850
Four minutes and counting.

09:30.874 --> 09:33.070
Hey, it ain't over
till it's over.

09:33.094 --> 09:35.028
It's almost over.

09:35.052 --> 09:37.988
Hey, the shade's on
this side, by the way.

09:38.012 --> 09:40.207
You wanna sit?

09:40.231 --> 09:44.148
All right, all right.
Ready? Yep.

09:47.282 --> 09:48.588
Better.

09:53.027 --> 09:55.701
I forgot his name.

09:55.725 --> 09:58.225
Jeff.

09:58.249 --> 10:01.011
Jeff.

10:01.035 --> 10:04.318
My brain kept saying "Josh."

10:04.342 --> 10:06.016
When he handed me this,

10:06.040 --> 10:08.608
I was so close to
saying, "Thanks, Josh."

10:10.697 --> 10:12.675
He likes you.

10:12.699 --> 10:16.417
We just met. He's...
he's being nice.

10:16.441 --> 10:18.182
He likes you.

10:27.322 --> 10:29.082
Oh, man.

10:29.106 --> 10:30.518
Loosened it up for me.

10:30.542 --> 10:33.260
Ah, see? That's very
kind you to say so.

10:33.284 --> 10:35.959
Oh, that's verykind.

10:38.028 --> 10:40.006
I have to get me some of those.

10:40.030 --> 10:44.271
Yeah, yeah, you do.

10:44.295 --> 10:47.579
Yeah, well, I gotta
get me one of these.

10:47.603 --> 10:49.712
Elevate our tail-gating game.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.714
Lot of vehicle for a couple.

10:51.738 --> 10:55.979
My uncle's got a six-seater.
He's also got triples.

10:56.003 --> 10:57.720
Yeah, well, I'm in a band.

10:57.744 --> 10:59.852
It's good for lugging around
our equipment, you know?

10:59.876 --> 11:01.941
Yeah.

11:01.965 --> 11:04.117
I'm gonna sit in
the shade a sec.

11:04.141 --> 11:07.077
She okay?

11:07.101 --> 11:09.669
Yeah. It's... It's
just the heat.

11:13.455 --> 11:16.303
Hey, guys. Hello, hello.

11:16.327 --> 11:18.155
Yep.

11:21.724 --> 11:23.180
How's it going out there?

11:23.204 --> 11:24.703
Um...

11:24.727 --> 11:26.705
I mean, technically,
they're doing stuff,

11:26.729 --> 11:29.882
but I'd say we have
another, like, 15 minutes.

11:29.906 --> 11:32.735
- Oh, great.
- And that's a positive estimate.

11:35.216 --> 11:37.914
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:39.916 --> 11:43.113
Okay, don't feel bad.

11:43.137 --> 11:47.421
The average time to change a
tire is, like, 20 minutes.

11:47.445 --> 11:50.120
I know things.

11:50.144 --> 11:52.668
Well, you know, we still
have time, we're good.

11:56.803 --> 12:01.261
- Four more minutes.
- No, no, that's two.

12:01.285 --> 12:06.005
Hey, you need a hand? Our
manhood is at stake here.

12:06.029 --> 12:08.162
We got this.

12:53.076 --> 12:55.513
Oh, come on, come on, come on.

13:01.868 --> 13:04.324
Anybody study social work?

13:04.348 --> 13:06.239
- Mnh-mnh.
- No.

13:06.263 --> 13:08.502
Um, okay, uh...

13:08.526 --> 13:12.115
how many SW majors does
it take to change a tire?

13:12.139 --> 13:13.139
Mmm, how many?

13:19.276 --> 13:20.950
Why should it change?!

13:20.974 --> 13:22.821
Maybe it's your perspective
that should change.

13:27.719 --> 13:29.591
I don't get it.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.819
Hey, I think you lost
something, buddy!

13:41.124 --> 13:42.885
Ooh.

13:47.522 --> 13:49.500
One-minute warning, boys.

13:49.524 --> 13:51.874
You know, I think it's
safe to say that...

14:25.865 --> 14:29.825
Sara? Sara?

14:39.443 --> 14:40.705
Sara!

14:49.453 --> 14:50.890
Sara.

15:16.089 --> 15:18.613
I can't breathe.

15:30.755 --> 15:32.298
Todd?

16:08.880 --> 16:10.578
What was that?!

16:19.630 --> 16:21.067
Back.

16:24.113 --> 16:25.308
Stay back!

16:45.569 --> 16:49.008
Shit!

16:59.061 --> 17:00.647
You see anything?

17:00.671 --> 17:02.311
You see where the shots
were coming from?!

17:03.892 --> 17:05.531
You see where the shots
were coming from?!

17:05.556 --> 17:07.306
What? What?!

17:07.329 --> 17:11.180
Do you see where the
shots are coming from?!

17:11.204 --> 17:12.746
I can't see anything back here!

18:20.403 --> 18:22.729
No! No!

18:22.753 --> 18:24.601
No! No! No! No!

18:30.239 --> 18:33.653
Do not fucking move!

18:33.677 --> 18:34.852
Breathe.

18:41.424 --> 18:43.489
- Uh...
- Hey...

18:45.602 --> 18:48.320
Please! Shh! You
just got grazed!

18:48.344 --> 18:50.757
You just... You just got grazed!
Stop!

18:50.781 --> 18:54.413
Shh!

18:54.437 --> 18:56.850
I'm gonna let you go.

18:56.874 --> 19:00.332
Do not move.

19:00.356 --> 19:04.641
We move, we're dead. Okay?

19:04.665 --> 19:07.668
- Okay?
- Mm-hm.

19:42.572 --> 19:44.835
S-she can't still...

21:17.667 --> 21:20.951
I'm gonna fucking kill you!
You fucking coward!

21:20.975 --> 21:23.345
- I'm gonna fucking kill you!
- No!

21:23.369 --> 21:25.129
- I'm gonna fucking kill you!
- Help me!

21:25.153 --> 21:28.524
Fucking asshole! Fuck you!

21:28.548 --> 21:31.028
Fuck you!

21:38.297 --> 21:39.776
I'm sorry.

22:03.234 --> 22:04.627
Are you hit?

22:07.413 --> 22:08.849
Are you hit?!

22:10.198 --> 22:11.871
No.

22:11.895 --> 22:14.507
We're gonna die out here.

22:16.073 --> 22:18.032
I'm going to die today.

22:19.468 --> 22:21.340
Look.

22:22.341 --> 22:23.951
Look.

22:26.562 --> 22:29.019
Shots got louder, remember?

22:29.043 --> 22:31.674
Must have been using
a suppressor.

22:31.698 --> 22:33.763
Uh, a silencer.

22:33.787 --> 22:36.461
The silencer lowered the
velocity of the bullet.

22:36.485 --> 22:40.900
Not by much but maybe enough
to make a difference?

22:40.924 --> 22:43.990
So he took it off.

22:44.014 --> 22:45.514
Might've helped a little bit.

22:45.538 --> 22:50.388
But the shots didn't
go through, right?

22:50.412 --> 22:52.588
He can't shoot through.

22:53.937 --> 22:56.287
He can't shoot through.

22:59.334 --> 23:02.835
Army brat. Hunting family.

23:02.859 --> 23:04.470
I grew up around guns.

23:07.255 --> 23:09.276
Probably an antique.

23:09.300 --> 23:13.019
And he ain't close.

23:13.043 --> 23:18.614
If it wasn't or he was...
they'd have gone through.

23:21.095 --> 23:22.662
How's your shoulder?

23:29.277 --> 23:30.974
Numb.

23:40.331 --> 23:42.159
Slug's still inside.

23:43.857 --> 23:45.336
Make a fist.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.495
Okay.

23:53.519 --> 23:57.847
If you can do that, you're okay.
Right?

23:57.871 --> 23:59.438
You're okay.

24:01.178 --> 24:04.723
Guys. I can't hear!

24:04.747 --> 24:06.923
What are we gonna do?

24:07.968 --> 24:11.208
We can't just sit here.

24:11.232 --> 24:13.060
We can't.

24:14.844 --> 24:18.084
- How long's he gonna stay put?
- No reception.

24:18.108 --> 24:20.347
Who's to say he's not
creeping around right now?

24:20.371 --> 24:22.731
- No law enforcement to interrupt.
- -Waiting to pick us off

24:22.755 --> 24:25.038
- one by one while we sit here.
- -He set up out here for a reason.

24:25.062 --> 24:27.093
You said it's been how
long since the last car?

24:27.117 --> 24:28.957
Think about how long he's
been waiting for one.

24:28.981 --> 24:30.227
What are you talking about?

24:30.251 --> 24:32.838
He set up out here for a reason.

24:32.862 --> 24:35.667
He's means to take
his time with us.

24:35.691 --> 24:38.651
With whoever happens to
come passing through.

24:42.481 --> 24:46.397
Listen, there's a lot
of cover back here.

24:48.312 --> 24:49.618
Hills we could hide behind.

24:53.535 --> 24:55.992
Four of us could
break out at once.

24:56.016 --> 24:57.515
He can't hit us all.

24:57.539 --> 25:00.692
Well, he's damn sure
gonna hit one of us!

25:00.716 --> 25:02.999
I know that!

25:03.023 --> 25:06.002
You don't think I know that?!

25:06.026 --> 25:08.028
It could be me he hits!

25:09.290 --> 25:10.746
At least I go down knowing

25:10.770 --> 25:12.748
I bought the rest
of you a chance!

25:12.772 --> 25:16.099
Son of a bitch shot out a tire
on a moving car with an antique!

25:16.123 --> 25:19.624
You wanna run?! I
can't stop you!

25:19.648 --> 25:23.280
But I'm not popping my head out
there for him to shoot at!

25:23.304 --> 25:25.393
Not until we're out of options.

25:38.624 --> 25:40.930
We drive on the spare.

25:42.149 --> 25:44.020
Floorboards, we stay low.

25:45.935 --> 25:47.434
Wheel's in his line of sight.

25:47.458 --> 25:49.939
You try and steer, he'll
take your hand off.

25:53.639 --> 25:55.902
Another car will come.

25:57.077 --> 26:00.056
C-could be ten minutes, an hour,

26:00.080 --> 26:02.537
or eight hours, but one will.

26:02.561 --> 26:05.191
There are two dead
bodies in the road.

26:05.215 --> 26:06.652
They're gonna see them.

26:13.615 --> 26:15.617
I got a signal over there.

26:19.447 --> 26:22.731
Even if they get...
Even if he stops them,

26:22.755 --> 26:24.384
they won't be stuck
where we're stuck.

26:24.408 --> 26:26.473
They'll... They'll
call the police.

26:26.497 --> 26:29.564
The... the police'll come,
and they'll have guns.

26:29.588 --> 26:32.068
You got a signal there?

27:08.888 --> 27:10.106
Fuck.

27:19.594 --> 27:20.943
Don't.

27:24.120 --> 27:25.556
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

27:30.561 --> 27:33.739
- Selfie stick.
- Got it for the trip.

27:43.662 --> 27:45.620
Hey, hey, uh, hold on.

27:46.969 --> 27:49.644
In case we get something.

27:51.278 --> 27:53.256
Welcome to voice activation.

27:53.280 --> 27:54.649
How can I help today?

27:54.673 --> 27:58.154
Okay.

28:05.901 --> 28:08.837
Okay.

28:30.796 --> 28:31.903
I got a signal.

28:31.927 --> 28:34.514
Dial 911!

28:34.538 --> 28:36.212
Oh, shit!

28:36.236 --> 28:39.345
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

28:39.369 --> 28:41.870
Fuck!

28:55.559 --> 28:58.649
Give me your phone.
Give me your phone!

29:00.739 --> 29:02.107
Give it to me.

29:02.131 --> 29:03.959
He'll just blast that one, too.

29:06.745 --> 29:09.704
You're not thinking straight!

29:46.045 --> 29:50.373
Okay. We put it in
neutral, the SUV.

29:50.397 --> 29:54.681
We stick to this side! Okay?
We nudge it a few feet back.

29:54.705 --> 29:57.578
We got a signal.

30:08.676 --> 30:10.480
We're on an incline.

30:10.504 --> 30:13.004
You got a bullet
in your shoulder.

30:13.028 --> 30:15.920
If we stay to this side,
we have no leverage.

30:15.944 --> 30:18.729
It gets away from us,
we're in the open.

30:21.210 --> 30:22.690
We have to try.

30:28.783 --> 30:31.980
Are the keys in the ignition?

30:32.004 --> 30:34.547
Can't put it in neutral without
the keys in the ignition.

30:34.571 --> 30:36.288
It'll break down.

30:48.585 --> 30:51.197
Fuck!

30:57.029 --> 30:58.857
Fuck.

31:04.601 --> 31:07.039
Okay...

31:08.214 --> 31:10.651
Okay.

31:16.613 --> 31:18.354
You're gonna get
yourself killed.

32:11.059 --> 32:12.495
On three.

32:40.045 --> 32:43.676
Ahh!

32:49.097 --> 32:50.857
Hurry up in there!

32:50.881 --> 32:54.209
You've gotta get out of there!
Hurry up!

32:58.585 --> 33:00.215
Come on!

33:15.558 --> 33:17.082
Did you...

34:22.147 --> 34:23.757
Did you see him?!

35:22.468 --> 35:26.012
Get the stick ready.

35:26.036 --> 35:27.710
He ain't gonna
fall for it twice.

35:27.734 --> 35:32.367
All we need is a second just
to put the car into neutral.

35:32.391 --> 35:35.916
You reach back in there,
you're gonna pull out a stump.

35:52.541 --> 35:53.977
Todd?

35:57.285 --> 35:58.591
What?

36:00.245 --> 36:01.439
What are you doing?

36:01.463 --> 36:04.312
Hey! Todd!

36:05.946 --> 36:09.143
Lucky son of a bitch.

36:09.167 --> 36:12.126
Yeah, lucky.

36:35.367 --> 36:37.064
Fuck.

36:47.030 --> 36:49.487
Guys.

36:49.511 --> 36:51.359
Guys!

36:51.383 --> 36:54.299
What's the plan?

36:57.127 --> 36:59.236
Hey! What's the plan?!

36:59.260 --> 37:02.307
Guys!

37:04.439 --> 37:08.027
Somebody answer me!
What's the plan?

37:08.051 --> 37:09.531
It's not going to work.

37:13.970 --> 37:18.168
You're gonna leave
me here, aren't you?

37:18.192 --> 37:21.911
We're gonna send back help
is what we're gonna do.

37:21.935 --> 37:26.045
Or you...

37:26.069 --> 37:29.788
You could try running
over, move in a zigzag!

37:33.860 --> 37:36.317
What the hell do you
want me to say?!

37:39.039 --> 37:41.147
I'm sorry!

37:41.171 --> 37:44.349
I'm sorry!

37:46.176 --> 37:50.485
Eric... I'm sorry.

38:01.322 --> 38:03.474
Keren...

38:03.498 --> 38:05.998
what do you think?

38:06.022 --> 38:07.565
Do you think I should run?

38:07.589 --> 38:12.091
We roll, he starts shooting,

38:12.115 --> 38:15.443
he's distracted, maybe
you have a chance.

38:15.467 --> 38:17.575
I asked what you thought.

38:17.599 --> 38:19.882
I think we should wait him out.

38:19.906 --> 38:22.319
I think we should allrun!

38:22.343 --> 38:24.887
Yeah, we know.

38:24.911 --> 38:28.717
Jodi, what do you think?

38:28.741 --> 38:31.285
If he were gonna
come down after us,

38:31.309 --> 38:34.268
he w-would've done
it by now right?

38:37.402 --> 38:39.317
Okay, okay...

38:42.058 --> 38:44.080
Say another car comes.

38:44.104 --> 38:47.910
You don't think he's gonna use
that for target practice, too?

38:47.934 --> 38:49.805
Huh?

38:52.242 --> 38:56.290
How many more bodies is he
gonna stack up out there?

39:01.208 --> 39:03.317
Can you live with that?

39:03.341 --> 39:07.495
Knowing that maybe we could've
stopped him and didn't?

39:07.519 --> 39:09.932
I couldn't.

39:09.956 --> 39:12.935
I couldn't.

39:12.959 --> 39:15.744
Neutral's a risk. I know.

39:17.659 --> 39:19.052
But so's running!

39:21.184 --> 39:23.641
And so's sitting here.

39:23.665 --> 39:25.885
Don't pretend it isn't.

39:32.108 --> 39:35.174
We got a signal three feet back.

39:35.198 --> 39:37.853
If you really want this to
stop, then just say so!

39:40.247 --> 39:42.205
Say so.

39:44.817 --> 39:47.515
Ah, fuck.

39:52.215 --> 39:53.913
Never know.

40:25.248 --> 40:27.401
One... two...

40:30.602 --> 40:31.796
Three.

40:48.054 --> 40:49.423
- Todd!
- Come on!

40:54.582 --> 40:57.455
Come on, Todd!

40:58.499 --> 41:00.259
Get up! We need you!

41:00.283 --> 41:02.610
Go! It's working!

41:05.463 --> 41:07.745
No!

41:07.769 --> 41:11.445
No! No!

41:11.469 --> 41:14.883
No!

41:14.907 --> 41:16.885
No!

41:18.171 --> 41:20.105
- Jodi!
- Stop!

41:20.129 --> 41:22.654
Stop! Don't leave me!

41:31.489 --> 41:35.120
No!

41:59.604 --> 42:02.998
Reloading! He's reloading!

42:29.111 --> 42:31.786
No!

42:33.159 --> 42:36.051
No!

42:36.075 --> 42:38.270
No!

42:46.520 --> 42:49.194
Stop!

42:52.482 --> 42:54.069
He could've shot me!

42:54.093 --> 42:55.592
He could've shot
me, but he didn't.

42:55.616 --> 42:59.944
Eric!

42:59.968 --> 43:02.991
- He used me to lure him out.
- Shit. Shit.

43:03.015 --> 43:04.993
He's just playing with us now.

43:05.017 --> 43:07.952
Eric, you gotta get your leg up!
You're losing a lot of blood!

43:07.976 --> 43:10.825
Eric!

43:16.202 --> 43:17.507
Eric!

43:19.379 --> 43:20.661
You don't, you'll bleed out!

43:27.692 --> 43:30.608
Good! Good! Now
take your belt off!

43:32.566 --> 43:35.501
Hurry up and tie it tight as you
can around your thigh, okay?

43:35.525 --> 43:38.417
It'll stop the bleeding!

43:44.317 --> 43:46.208
Tight as you can!
Tight as you can!

43:49.975 --> 43:51.343
No passing out on us!

43:51.367 --> 43:54.433
You gotta stay awake!
Stay awake!

43:57.112 --> 44:00.091
Hey, hey, come on, buddy!
Don't pass out on us!

44:00.115 --> 44:02.877
Not now! Stay with us!

44:02.901 --> 44:04.903
Stay awake!

44:06.774 --> 44:09.777
Shit! Ah, shit!

46:36.315 --> 46:38.752
There's water in there.

46:45.280 --> 46:47.239
Uh-huh.

46:59.077 --> 47:00.861
Go.

47:02.123 --> 47:03.951
Here.

47:15.876 --> 47:17.269
Mmm.

47:20.315 --> 47:23.710
Hit it again. You need
it more than we do.

47:42.772 --> 47:45.926
Mmm!

47:45.950 --> 47:49.277
Whoo! That was refreshing!

47:49.301 --> 47:52.913
Fucking asshole.

47:54.567 --> 47:56.762
Didn't shoot this time.

47:56.786 --> 48:01.463
Yeah, well, like
she said, he's...

48:01.487 --> 48:05.404
He's... He's just
taking his time.

48:07.841 --> 48:10.080
We moved.

48:10.104 --> 48:13.673
His line of sight
could've changed.

48:14.935 --> 48:17.871
Unless he moved, too.

48:17.895 --> 48:20.288
He could be moving as we speak.

48:25.511 --> 48:26.860
Eric!

48:30.995 --> 48:34.563
Water! Rest for you!

48:44.486 --> 48:46.725
Hey.

48:46.749 --> 48:49.554
You mind giving me a hand?

49:33.796 --> 49:35.209
Oh, God!

49:36.886 --> 49:40.127
Eric, keep talking! You gotta...
You gotta stay awake!

49:40.151 --> 49:42.694
Remember!

49:42.718 --> 49:45.088
Eric! Eric!

49:45.112 --> 49:48.463
Eric!

49:50.161 --> 49:53.270
Goddamn it!

50:55.052 --> 50:58.490
Sorry.

51:29.869 --> 51:31.784
"You gotta be there."

51:56.896 --> 51:58.680
Surprise.

Jeff was the other
guy's name, right?

52:58.305 --> 53:01.352
I feel like shit because
I couldn't remember.

53:05.269 --> 53:08.968
He said that this was a lot
of vehicle for a couple.

53:11.884 --> 53:16.932
I told him I used it to haul
around my band equipment.

53:18.586 --> 53:20.893
That wasn't true.

53:22.242 --> 53:24.113
Um...

53:28.117 --> 53:30.381
Sarah got pregnant.

53:33.732 --> 53:35.753
We don't know how it happened.

53:35.777 --> 53:40.608
We were always so careful.

53:43.045 --> 53:46.764
It was scary, but we
decided to start a family.

53:46.788 --> 53:49.680
So I sold my bike...

53:49.704 --> 53:52.098
my car.

53:53.882 --> 53:56.407
Put it up against
this piece of shit.

53:58.017 --> 54:01.977
Bought a... baby seat and...

54:03.457 --> 54:05.546
crib.

54:07.331 --> 54:09.463
Went all out.

54:10.508 --> 54:12.945
I just really
couldn't help myself.

54:21.345 --> 54:23.390
And then, uh...

54:24.652 --> 54:27.196
We, uh...

54:27.220 --> 54:30.789
we went in for, like, her
umpteenth ultrasound.

54:37.274 --> 54:39.208
There was no heartbeat.

54:39.232 --> 54:42.583
There were no signs, no, um...

54:44.629 --> 54:45.997
no symptoms...

54:46.021 --> 54:49.218
no warnings.

54:49.242 --> 54:52.637
Just... nothing.

54:58.773 --> 55:04.301
Just here with us one second, and then...
gone the next.

55:15.137 --> 55:17.705
It's really nice out here.

55:42.382 --> 55:44.732
What are you doing?

55:47.518 --> 55:51.672
Wait. Todd, wait!

55:51.696 --> 55:57.310
Wait, come back here!
Todd! Todd, stop!

56:09.496 --> 56:11.193
Get the fuck back here.

56:14.066 --> 56:17.045
Why isn't he shooting?

56:17.069 --> 56:19.550
I don't know.

56:22.857 --> 56:25.294
What if he's gone?

57:19.392 --> 57:21.307
Todd...

58:14.578 --> 58:16.667
Hey.

58:31.682 --> 58:33.684
Keren, Keren, Keren!

58:38.950 --> 58:42.214
Todd, there's something
moving back here!

01:00:31.453 --> 01:00:34.195
Just do it.

01:00:39.113 --> 01:00:41.614
Come on! Let's just get this...

01:00:51.865 --> 01:00:55.584
Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:00:55.608 --> 01:00:57.107
What! What is it?!

01:00:57.131 --> 01:00:58.587
It's a ca...

01:00:58.611 --> 01:01:00.961
Oh, fuck, shit!

01:01:06.358 --> 01:01:08.534
Shit.

01:01:40.784 --> 01:01:43.612
What? What did you see?

01:01:52.186 --> 01:01:55.513
Hey, Daddy? Daddy?

01:01:55.537 --> 01:01:58.497
Mommy? Where are we?

01:01:59.977 --> 01:02:02.849
Daddy. Daddy, hey!

01:02:04.198 --> 01:02:06.655
- Daddy, wake up!
- What's up, Mama?

01:02:06.679 --> 01:02:08.613
I think there's been an acci...

01:02:58.426 --> 01:03:01.342
Go, go!

01:03:15.269 --> 01:03:17.358
Oh...

01:03:28.456 --> 01:03:30.304
- Stay to the other side!
- Go back in the car!

01:03:30.328 --> 01:03:32.915
- No, there's a shooter!
- The other side!

01:03:32.939 --> 01:03:34.830
Stop!

01:03:44.168 --> 01:03:46.799
Stop! Stop!

01:03:46.823 --> 01:03:49.173
There's a shooter!

01:03:50.130 --> 01:03:51.828
Shit.

01:03:53.742 --> 01:03:56.983
- Stop! Stop!
- Other way! Other way!

01:04:04.275 --> 01:04:07.820
- No, stop! Stop!
- Other way!

01:04:18.593 --> 01:04:20.963
Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:04:27.907 --> 01:04:29.885
- Keep going!
- Hurry! Hurry!

01:04:39.136 --> 01:04:41.505
Stay low! Stay low!

01:04:41.529 --> 01:04:44.117
My daughter! My
daughter's out there!

01:04:44.141 --> 01:04:47.947
There's a shooter! A shooter!

01:04:47.971 --> 01:04:52.081
What?! I can't hear a
fucking word you say!

01:04:53.454 --> 01:04:56.022
My daughter! Can
you get to her?!

01:05:00.331 --> 01:05:01.699
Can you get a signal?

01:05:01.723 --> 01:05:03.136
My daughter! Can
you get to her?!

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:04.683
Can you get a cell signal?!

01:05:06.250 --> 01:05:08.489
911!

01:05:08.513 --> 01:05:11.666
Call 911!

01:05:21.178 --> 01:05:22.875
Shit.

01:05:49.206 --> 01:05:51.077
Run! Get out of there!

01:05:52.731 --> 01:05:54.535
Where's he gonna go?
Where? The tree?

01:05:54.559 --> 01:05:57.320
He'd never make it.

01:05:57.344 --> 01:06:00.521
That call is our last chance.

01:06:52.095 --> 01:06:53.792
Dad?

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:22.386
He could have gotten through.

01:07:23.604 --> 01:07:26.738
He could've!

01:07:32.483 --> 01:07:35.375
It'll be dark soon.

01:07:35.399 --> 01:07:38.856
Once that fire goes
out, it'll be...

01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:41.598
It'll be pitch black
in all directions.

01:07:41.622 --> 01:07:44.514
- We go for the trees.
- Like Eric?

01:07:44.538 --> 01:07:48.127
It'll... It will be
a void out here!

01:07:48.151 --> 01:07:53.001
He's not gonna see us. He's
not gonna see anything.

01:07:53.025 --> 01:07:54.742
He probably has night vision.

01:07:54.766 --> 01:07:57.005
Probably?

01:07:57.029 --> 01:08:00.598
You wanna find out for yourself?
Be my guest.

01:08:02.817 --> 01:08:04.230
I can't.

01:08:04.254 --> 01:08:06.232
I can't sit here for
another four hours

01:08:06.256 --> 01:08:09.017
just to watch another car
full of people get chewed up.

01:08:09.041 --> 01:08:11.304
I can't. I can't.

01:08:15.134 --> 01:08:17.460
Smoke.

01:08:17.484 --> 01:08:20.462
He can't see through it.

01:08:20.487 --> 01:08:23.162
Soldiers under fire
pop smoke grenades.

01:08:23.185 --> 01:08:25.666
Shooters can't see 'em.

01:08:29.756 --> 01:08:31.497
Army brat, huh?

01:11:21.146 --> 01:11:25.431
Keren! Keren!

01:11:25.455 --> 01:11:27.718
Really?

01:12:06.713 --> 01:12:11.433
Message to my mom,
dad, and sisters.

01:12:11.457 --> 01:12:13.894
Just in case.

01:13:49.207 --> 01:13:51.992
I think it pissed him off.

01:13:53.646 --> 01:13:56.756
Hey, careful. Not yet.

01:13:56.780 --> 01:14:00.412
I'd rather be shot than burned!

01:14:11.490 --> 01:14:13.100
Engine! Come on.

01:14:18.149 --> 01:14:19.866
He's wearing down the walls.

01:14:19.890 --> 01:14:22.608
Engine block's tougher to crack.

01:14:22.632 --> 01:14:25.722
- It'll be safer here...
- For how long?

01:14:30.901 --> 01:14:34.358
When those tires go,
it'll be toxic as hell.

01:14:34.382 --> 01:14:36.472
Try not to breathe
too much of it in.

01:14:40.563 --> 01:14:42.478
We go together right?

01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:04.761
The call. It got through!

01:15:09.766 --> 01:15:11.265
Where did it go?

01:15:11.289 --> 01:15:14.292
They must've seen
him shooting at us.

01:15:19.863 --> 01:15:23.016
Sergeant, we have a shooter
in an elevated position.

01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:26.585
Request state assistance
as soon as possible.

01:15:28.741 --> 01:15:30.850
Damn it!

01:15:30.874 --> 01:15:33.374
Do you think he saw us?

01:15:33.398 --> 01:15:35.356
He saw us.

01:15:37.358 --> 01:15:40.424
We in range?

01:15:40.448 --> 01:15:45.952
You see that road. When
we are, we'll know.

01:15:45.976 --> 01:15:50.391
All right, as soon as he pops up
another round, we'll light him up.

01:15:50.415 --> 01:15:52.088
Copy.

01:15:52.112 --> 01:15:57.485
Must have a real nice spot.
Don't want to give it up.

01:15:57.509 --> 01:16:02.272
These kids can't wait for state.

01:16:02.296 --> 01:16:06.059
Come in. I said,
repeat, come in.

01:16:06.083 --> 01:16:08.365
We have an active shoo...

01:16:08.389 --> 01:16:10.957
This piece of shit.

01:16:18.098 --> 01:16:19.378
I'm just gonna call the station.

01:16:19.402 --> 01:16:20.814
Dim it.

01:16:23.796 --> 01:16:26.645
Yeah.

01:16:26.669 --> 01:16:29.106
Yeah, put me through.

01:16:30.803 --> 01:16:33.173
Yeah, I... Goddamn it, listen.

01:16:33.197 --> 01:16:36.132
I heard it from her, and I
want to hear it from you.

01:16:36.156 --> 01:16:38.526
We need to get...

01:16:38.550 --> 01:16:41.205
Listen here, asshole.

01:16:58.744 --> 01:17:00.398
Shit!

01:17:12.366 --> 01:17:14.431
Jodi! Together, remember?

01:17:14.455 --> 01:17:15.674
Together!

01:17:27.643 --> 01:17:29.664
Now! We've gotta go now!

01:17:29.688 --> 01:17:31.124
I'm not taking my
chances with them!

01:17:32.735 --> 01:17:34.998
Jodi!

01:19:21.017 --> 01:19:23.256
You hit? You?

01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:26.302
Good.

01:19:26.326 --> 01:19:28.546
Keep your head down.

01:19:36.772 --> 01:19:39.949
- Eleven o'clock.
- Right.

01:19:59.533 --> 01:20:01.120
Let's go! Please!

01:20:36.744 --> 01:20:37.896
What are you doing?!
