WEBVTT

00:06.072 --> 00:10.736
Yeah. Listen, we would love
to make the ice-cream social, but...

00:10.810 --> 00:12.869
<i>- But what, Steve?
- Yeah, lie to us.</i>

00:12.946 --> 00:17.007
- We've kind of gotten behind at work.
- We have become one!

01:07.934 --> 01:09.265
<i>You're gonna die.</i>

01:10.336 --> 01:12.201
This is some good TV.

01:12.939 --> 01:14.463
Hey, wake up.

01:14.841 --> 01:17.469
- You're missing some good TV.
- Change it.

01:17.544 --> 01:19.910
I ain't changing this. This is the best.

01:20.213 --> 01:22.943
- Change it.
- To what? Come on, this is good.

01:23.016 --> 01:24.779
Why don't we let the arrow decide?

01:24.851 --> 01:26.978
No, don't do... Come on!

01:27.320 --> 01:29.515
And now it's changed. The changeling.

01:29.589 --> 01:31.784
- What was that?
- What do you think it was?

01:31.858 --> 01:33.325
It was you, boy.

01:35.095 --> 01:38.428
This closet was full of TVs last time
I checked, and now there's none.

01:38.498 --> 01:42.229
- 'Cause you keep breaking them.
- 'Cause you keep pissing me off too bad!

01:42.302 --> 01:46.329
You should be lucky and thoughtful
enough to throw the anger at the media...

01:46.406 --> 01:49.466
- and not your buttocks!
- Both of you, get in here.

01:49.542 --> 01:52.602
Every time you break a TV,
where do you think they come from?

01:52.679 --> 01:54.874
- Jesus.
- No, it's Santa Claus.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.416
- It's the same thing.
- There ain't no Santa Claus.

01:57.484 --> 02:00.385
- I know. I'm Jewish.
- I've been cloning these TVs for you.

02:00.453 --> 02:03.251
- From this day forward.
- You know what? I'm tired of doing it.

02:03.323 --> 02:06.258
- You have a cloner?
- You know I have a cloner.

02:06.326 --> 02:08.726
- You have a cloner?
- Say, can I borrow your cloner?

02:08.794 --> 02:10.763
No, I use that thing for research.

02:10.830 --> 02:12.991
It's not your own personal
electronics store.

02:13.066 --> 02:17.264
Okay, you are absolutely right.
We are very sorry.

02:17.337 --> 02:21.171
- That was a one-time thing.
- You know, that's what I was just thinking.

02:21.241 --> 02:23.072
And we mean it this time.

02:23.643 --> 02:27.704
- Okay, but this is the last one.
- That one?

02:27.780 --> 02:30.647
- That better not have been the last one.
- Fine... it, Shake.

02:30.717 --> 02:32.048
Enjoy one of my books then.

02:32.118 --> 02:34.746
All right. Come on, now. We'll be good.

02:34.821 --> 02:37.847
Don't be that way.
Why are you being so cranky? Please.

02:37.924 --> 02:40.620
No books. I can't read. I'm not a loser.

02:40.693 --> 02:43.161
Yeah, Frylock. Please, make us a TV.

02:43.229 --> 02:46.198
Look at me.
How else am I gonna face the day?

02:46.633 --> 02:49.295
I ain't got no job, my wife left me...

02:49.369 --> 02:51.963
bills piling up,
I got child-support payments.

02:52.038 --> 02:55.701
And I don't know if any of what I just said
is true. But I believe it.

02:55.775 --> 02:58.505
- He is right.
- We needs to dull our senses.

02:58.978 --> 03:02.641
All right, fine.
I'll do one more, but that is it.

03:02.715 --> 03:03.943
All right, TV!

03:04.017 --> 03:06.850
<i>We'll use them to The Living End,
starring James Bond.</i>

03:06.920 --> 03:09.286
Shake, I've abused this thing too much
as it is.

03:09.355 --> 03:13.121
Clone something too many times, and
the molecular structure will break down...

03:13.193 --> 03:15.855
- and we won't know what we'll get.
- Just get the TV.

03:15.929 --> 03:19.592
You and your
quasi-intellectual hobnobbery...

03:20.867 --> 03:23.631
You know what makes me sick?
That you get away with it.

03:23.703 --> 03:27.571
You just be more careful with that,
because it's the last one.

03:30.743 --> 03:33.371
- Oh, really?
- Says who, boy?

03:33.446 --> 03:35.846
Yeah, big man.
You'll make more of these...

03:35.915 --> 03:38.349
because I'll tell you to, right to your face.

03:38.418 --> 03:39.817
- You tell him.
- Frylock.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.319
He's gone, right?

03:42.322 --> 03:45.086
- Did you just see that?
- No, we didn't. Everything's fine.

03:45.158 --> 03:47.786
Just shut up and I'll get the controller.

03:47.860 --> 03:49.987
You ain't gonna say you didn't see that!

03:50.063 --> 03:52.998
I'm not in the business
of seeing whatever pleases you.

03:53.066 --> 03:56.058
- Get back here, you son of a...
- Well, I'm in business.

03:56.169 --> 03:58.000
The business of kicking your ass.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.869
And let me tell you, business is booming.

04:01.174 --> 04:02.801
I'm open for business.

04:03.309 --> 04:05.504
The business of giving you the business.

04:06.646 --> 04:08.273
I hope you're buying.

04:10.550 --> 04:14.077
- Did you hear me say that?
- You looking to expand your business?

04:14.287 --> 04:15.549
Business is cool!

04:15.622 --> 04:19.524
<i>Damn you, Shake Zulu.
King of the freaking idiots.</i>

04:19.892 --> 04:21.017
All right.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.892
That's what's called
taking command of the situation.

04:23.963 --> 04:26.488
Meatwad, you turn it on.

04:26.566 --> 04:29.399
I ain't going near that TV, boy.
I think that thing is alive.

04:29.469 --> 04:32.768
Go over there, get close to it,
and touch it to turn it on.

04:32.839 --> 04:35.239
- What'll you give me?
- Six months to a year.

04:35.308 --> 04:37.299
And, brother, you are dead.

04:37.377 --> 04:39.038
- All right.
- We're wasting time.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.739
- Just give me a second.
- Turn it on.

04:40.813 --> 04:42.474
I'm getting to it.

04:42.548 --> 04:45.381
Just don't wake it up. I want to surprise it.

04:47.720 --> 04:48.982
Look at that!

04:49.055 --> 04:51.080
- Yes, I see.
- You're on the TV.

04:51.924 --> 04:53.915
You know, I've been on TV a lot.

04:53.993 --> 04:57.258
See, this... Yeah, sure.
This is my sitcom with...

04:57.330 --> 04:59.127
<i>I'm in your house.</i>

05:01.367 --> 05:04.131
With a science-fiction horror twist.

05:04.470 --> 05:06.165
It's called...

05:08.308 --> 05:10.276
- What's it called?
- I don't know. Shut up.

05:10.343 --> 05:12.470
I'm trying to hear my lines.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.279
What the hell is this?

05:15.348 --> 05:18.112
You said this is your sitcom
with a sci-fi horror twist.

05:18.184 --> 05:19.481
It's never been done before.

05:19.552 --> 05:22.282
I know. I just don't remember
filming this episode.

05:22.355 --> 05:25.017
I can tell my instincts are strong
in this scene, though.

05:25.091 --> 05:26.183
I got a lot of motivation.

05:26.259 --> 05:28.591
You're in Frylock's room.
You ain't allowed in there.

05:28.661 --> 05:31.061
<i>- Why'd you film in there?
- Call me.</i>

05:34.567 --> 05:39.129
- Where did you get all that money?
- Obviously, I am a drug lord in this scene.

05:39.205 --> 05:42.800
Where the hell else do you think
a guy like me gets this amount of cash?

05:43.576 --> 05:45.510
The cloner. Give me a dollar, quick!

05:45.578 --> 05:49.378
Okay, look, my grandmother
gave me this dollar before she died.

05:49.449 --> 05:51.508
- It's my birthday dollar.
- Thank you, Granny!

05:51.584 --> 05:53.074
- You spent it well, baby.
- Bitch!

05:53.152 --> 05:55.382
Just watch the TV. You'll forget.

05:56.289 --> 05:57.688
Forget what?

05:58.925 --> 06:01.291
<i>What did I tell you
about messing with my cloner?</i>

06:01.361 --> 06:03.693
<i>Frylock, I am so sorry about it.</i>

06:03.763 --> 06:08.132
<i>You know what? I really should have
taken your feelings into consideration.</i>

06:10.036 --> 06:12.732
<i>No, look, man.
I'm the one who's sorry, okay?</i>

06:12.805 --> 06:15.831
<i>I'm sorry I made the cheerleading squad
and you didn't.</i>

06:15.908 --> 06:18.968
<i>It's okay. You were the better cheerleader.</i>

06:19.078 --> 06:22.639
<i>Well, I was no slouch.
Did you see me do those cartwheels?</i>

06:23.783 --> 06:25.307
I identify with that.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.683
<i>Okay, don't rub it in.</i>

06:29.856 --> 06:32.791
<i>- There's a zinger.
- Okay, then how about I blow it in?</i>

06:32.859 --> 06:34.190
<i>What?</i>

06:34.427 --> 06:37.624
- Shake! Damn!
- What do you want?

06:38.798 --> 06:41.926
Nothing. You just do what you was doing.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.032
<i>- It's all good.
- Great news.</i>

06:44.270 --> 06:46.568
<i>You both made the cheerleading squad.</i>

06:51.511 --> 06:54.878
This is what I like. A real reality show.

06:55.047 --> 06:57.174
<i>- Hey, Frylock.
- Oh, no. Frylock.</i>

06:57.450 --> 06:59.008
<i>Hey, Meatwad. Look what I got.</i>

06:59.085 --> 07:00.916
<i>- Don't let him in.
- Come on in.</i>

07:00.987 --> 07:03.114
All right, he's in,
but don't ask him to dance.

07:03.189 --> 07:05.817
<i>- Do you want to dance?
- I'd love to dance. Come on.</i>

07:05.892 --> 07:08.554
You asked him to dance!
I told you not to ask him to dance.

07:08.628 --> 07:10.323
<i>- You shut up.
- Oh, God.</i>

07:14.467 --> 07:16.128
Maybe this is a different show.

07:16.202 --> 07:18.170
<i>Anybody want some metal candy?</i>

07:18.471 --> 07:20.302
It's the same damn show!

07:20.373 --> 07:23.342
Run to your chocolate huts!

07:23.509 --> 07:25.875
<i>Come on, Meatwad.
You're not hungry for some cane?</i>

07:25.945 --> 07:28.937
- No!
- Meatwad, what is it?

07:29.015 --> 07:31.950
You know exactly what it is.
Get away from...

07:32.018 --> 07:35.977
Get away from me.
I need evaluation and dinner.

07:36.289 --> 07:39.156
- By dinner, I don't mean gnome heads.
- Gnome heads?

07:39.225 --> 07:40.692
You said it. You know.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.159
- You done did it.
- Did what?

07:42.228 --> 07:45.459
- Something's wrong with that TV.
- There's nothing wrong with it.

07:46.365 --> 07:48.390
Okay, something's wrong with it.

07:48.868 --> 07:50.768
That's that. Hey, Carl.

07:50.837 --> 07:54.637
- What, you got another busted TV?
- Something's horribly wrong with it.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.033
That's wireless, too?

07:57.343 --> 08:00.574
What would I care?
I'm sure someone will grab it.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.409
Well, see you later.

08:08.654 --> 08:11.088
- Freaking awesome.
- What were you doing in there?

08:11.157 --> 08:13.489
What are you doing home so soon?
Answer that.

08:13.559 --> 08:16.426
- What are these bills doing here?
- Don't touch. They're mine.

08:16.496 --> 08:19.260
You can't use the cloner
to counterfeit money, Shake.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.459
We will discuss this when I feel like it.

08:21.534 --> 08:25.994
Right now, I gotta go get a new Camaro,
'cause that's where the... is, baby.

08:26.072 --> 08:28.233
There are limits
to how much you can clone.

08:28.307 --> 08:30.332
Matter breaks down over time.

08:30.409 --> 08:33.309
I'm sorry I'm not fluent in Dorkinese!

08:34.547 --> 08:35.878
On the other hand...

08:35.948 --> 08:39.349
I could use this to feed
all the hungry children of the world.

08:39.619 --> 08:43.783
Yeah, with my new chain
of family-style restaurants.

08:44.190 --> 08:45.714
Hell, yeah!

08:46.859 --> 08:48.827
<i>- Yeah, I'm busy. What?
- Hey, Fry man.</i>

08:48.895 --> 08:51.625
Ordinarily I wouldn't call you
because I don't like you.

08:51.697 --> 08:53.358
But you're on the TV, man.

08:53.432 --> 08:57.266
Check out Channel 666. That's weird.

08:57.336 --> 09:00.499
- Look, Carl, I don't have time...
- Hang on, I'm on it now!

09:00.606 --> 09:02.699
That is me. Awesome!

09:02.975 --> 09:05.068
Frigging awesome. I'm on TV!

09:05.278 --> 09:06.836
I look pretty good.

09:06.913 --> 09:10.178
Chicken skin diet's
really paying off for me.

09:10.550 --> 09:14.452
God. You stay far away from this house,
do you hear me? Far away!

09:14.954 --> 09:16.581
<i>Well, now it's official.</i>

09:16.689 --> 09:20.284
<i>Frylock just as crazy as Shake, damn.</i>

09:21.160 --> 09:24.789
Frylock, I decided not to get the Camaro.

09:24.864 --> 09:26.422
- Wait! No.
- Guess why.

09:26.499 --> 09:27.864
You're dead.

09:28.534 --> 09:30.502
- Let me try that.
- No, you'll break it.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.834
This is a very expensive
piece of equipment.

09:32.905 --> 09:37.205
You think money just grows on trees?
No. You have to get it out of the cloner.

09:37.777 --> 09:40.211
- Get out of here!
- Get away from the money.

09:40.279 --> 09:42.213
The genetic structure is breaking down.

09:42.281 --> 09:45.478
It needs to be analyzed
at the Camaro dealership.

09:45.818 --> 09:48.480
I want some of that.
I provided the seed money.

09:48.621 --> 09:52.819
Here, you tripled your investment.
Now take a dirt nap. This is our money.

09:53.192 --> 09:55.490
You take another step
towards my money...

09:55.561 --> 09:56.960
and it'll be your last.

09:57.029 --> 09:58.257
You both back away.

09:58.331 --> 10:01.789
I seen what you done on the TV,
and I seen what you done to the TV.

10:01.867 --> 10:04.165
- I ain't afraid to use this.
- It's backwards.

10:04.236 --> 10:07.399
Let me help you. There you go.
Now you're ready to go.

10:07.473 --> 10:10.465
- I ain't gonna listen to your lies.
- I cannot tell a lie.

10:10.543 --> 10:12.602
You are holding it backwards.

10:12.678 --> 10:14.111
Who let the hippie in here?

10:14.180 --> 10:17.445
I got news for you, pal.
The dead are dead, okay?

10:17.516 --> 10:20.781
Maybe what you want is soap,
which is at the grocery store.

10:20.853 --> 10:24.016
You know, food you don't have to pick.
They sell meat there.

10:24.090 --> 10:25.557
- While you're at it...
- No!

10:25.625 --> 10:28.822
- Shut up! I'm talking to him.
- He's George Washington.

10:30.162 --> 10:31.220
I am.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.891
What the hell's he doing
next to my Benjamins?

10:33.966 --> 10:36.526
I have come bearing a message.

10:36.602 --> 10:39.036
Great Britain sought taxes
from the colonies...

10:39.105 --> 10:42.074
and they paid for their greed with blood.

10:42.241 --> 10:46.302
Now do you understand
the price of avarice?

10:46.379 --> 10:48.779
- Take him out.
- Wait. No!

10:53.486 --> 10:56.478
- I done took him out, didn't I?
- You really took him out.

10:56.555 --> 10:58.750
I knew I took him out! Yeah.

11:01.394 --> 11:03.453
- Did I take him out?
- We should've cloned $20s.

11:03.529 --> 11:04.860
Jackson wouldn't have given a...
