<i>The '50s were a grand time,
if you were a man.</i>

01:55.200 --> 01:59.205
<i>I'm Dick Nolan. I make things up
for a living. I'm a reporter.</i>

02:12.400 --> 02:15.563
<i>It's the strangest goddamn story
that I ever covered.</i>

02:15.720 --> 02:19.247
<i>It started the day that Margaret Ulbrich
walked out on her suffocating husband,</i>

02:19.400 --> 02:22.529
<i>long before it became
the fashionable thing to do.</i>

02:23.400 --> 02:25.323
Come on, Janie.

04:10.600 --> 04:13.444
Sugar! You made it!

04:13.600 --> 04:16.603
- You're in North Beach!
- Look at you, Deirdre!

04:16.760 --> 04:18.363
- Dee-Ann.
- Oh! Dee-Ann.

04:18.519 --> 04:21.120
I know, but I came on the scene
and Deirdre sounded like something

04:21.279 --> 04:24.124
my mother would call me.
So are you flipping for all this?

04:24.320 --> 04:26.846
- Are you settled? How's Jane?
- Jane is swell.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.684
She's going to
this sweet, little school.

04:28.840 --> 04:31.200
You know, it's really hard
without her father, and I just...

04:31.320 --> 04:32.560
- ...don't know if we're gonna be...
- Stop that.

04:32.720 --> 04:34.370
- What?
- You're better off.

04:34.520 --> 04:36.522
Between us, I never liked Frank.

04:36.680 --> 04:38.523
- You were a bridesmaid.
- Exactly.

04:38.680 --> 04:41.809
That's why I couldn't say anything.
But if I see you wrong off again,

04:41.960 --> 04:44.804
I will tell you. Now, come on,
let's have some fun.

04:44.960 --> 04:48.601
For jazz, check out the Hungry i.
For Italian, Vanessi's.

04:48.760 --> 04:52.685
For salvation, try the Buddhist temple.
For art, Six Gallery.

04:52.840 --> 04:55.491
- Do they only show Modern?
- Everyone only shows Modern.

04:55.640 --> 04:57.290
And in the basement,
they have espresso.

04:57.480 --> 04:59.209
Espresso, what's that?
Is that like reefer?

04:59.440 --> 05:01.124
You have a lot to learn.

05:11.960 --> 05:14.281
<i>Back then,
women didn't leave.</i>

05:14.440 --> 05:16.681
<i>Not without a job or prospects.</i>

05:16.840 --> 05:19.081
<i>All she had was her paintings
in the trunk,</i>

05:19.240 --> 05:21.288
<i>and her daughter in the backseat.</i>

05:21.440 --> 05:23.044
Good luck.

05:28.840 --> 05:30.046
Okay.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.846
We don't get
many ladies in here.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.843
So, your husband approves
of you working?

05:39.200 --> 05:41.851
Uh, my husband and I are separated.

05:43.560 --> 05:46.723
Separated? Hm...

05:47.640 --> 05:52.362
I realize that I have
no employment experience,

05:52.600 --> 05:57.083
but I really do need this job.
I have a daughter to support.

05:57.880 --> 06:00.884
I'm not very good at tooting my
own horn, but I do love to paint.

06:01.040 --> 06:03.566
So if I could just
show you my portfolio.

06:03.720 --> 06:08.328
Um, I studied at the
Watkins Art Institute in Nashville,

06:08.480 --> 06:10.847
then I took some illustration classes
in New York.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.322
This is a... it's a pastel that I did.

06:14.480 --> 06:20.169
And, uh, this is a charcoal portrait.

06:21.040 --> 06:23.850
You do understand this
is a furniture company?

06:59.280 --> 07:02.841
Okay, sounds great.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.129
- You see anything you like?
- I like those over there.

07:06.320 --> 07:08.721
- They're really neat.
- Yeah.

07:08.880 --> 07:11.690
- Your stuff is cute.
- Thank you.

07:11.840 --> 07:15.083
- How much?
- Today's special, $2.

07:15.240 --> 07:16.765
I'll give you $1.

07:18.320 --> 07:20.721
- All right.
- All right, go ahead, Dylan.

07:20.880 --> 07:22.564
Go ahead and have a seat.

07:23.080 --> 07:25.242
- What's your name?
- My name is Dylan.

07:25.400 --> 07:28.404
- Dylan. And how old are you?
- I'm nine years old.

07:28.560 --> 07:31.086
Nine years old, wow.

07:34.760 --> 07:38.128
- It's like a Monet.
- Monet?

07:38.280 --> 07:42.251
Monet?
That's a hell of a compliment.

07:42.440 --> 07:45.364
Though, if I may
respectfully disagree,

07:45.520 --> 07:47.727
I'm more in the tradition of Pissarro.

07:47.920 --> 07:53.006
Come, come a little closer.
Come on. Good!

07:53.200 --> 07:57.569
See these daring
specks of bold color?

07:57.720 --> 08:00.883
Do you wanna touch it?
Come on.

08:01.080 --> 08:05.961
Go on, do it. I don't lay it on thick.
You're not gonna break it.

08:07.400 --> 08:09.721
It's $35.

08:11.120 --> 08:13.407
Would you excuse me one second?

08:14.240 --> 08:16.481
Here we are.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.170
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

08:22.320 --> 08:24.084
Oh, thank you.

08:27.600 --> 08:31.650
You're better than spare change.
You shouldn't sell yourself so cheap.

08:31.800 --> 08:36.522
- Well, I'm just glad they liked it.
- Oh! You're past that point.

08:36.679 --> 08:39.445
Your heart's in your work.

08:41.039 --> 08:42.246
What's your name?

08:44.520 --> 08:46.409
Margaret.

08:47.200 --> 08:50.204
Look, wouldn't you rather, uh, flirt
with those girls over there?

08:50.360 --> 08:52.806
No. I like you, Margaret...

08:53.840 --> 08:55.569
...Ulbrich.

08:55.760 --> 09:00.209
You know, Margaret Ulbrich,
you undervalue yourself.

09:00.560 --> 09:03.211
Let me show you how it's done.

09:04.280 --> 09:05.805
Little girl!

09:05.960 --> 09:09.043
How would you like
your portrait sketched

09:09.200 --> 09:13.330
by the world-renowned
Margaret Ulbrich, Queen of the Bay?

09:13.480 --> 09:16.450
In mere minutes,
she captures your soul!

09:16.600 --> 09:18.568
- Nah.
- "Nah"?

09:18.720 --> 09:21.326
Don't you wish this were you
in this beautiful painting?

09:21.480 --> 09:22.720
But that is me.

09:22.880 --> 09:25.884
And that's me,
and that one started as me,

09:26.080 --> 09:28.560
then Mother turned it
into a Chinese boy.

09:28.720 --> 09:33.760
Hm... My apologies.
I misconstrued the situation.

09:33.920 --> 09:35.604
Well, I'd better mosey along

09:35.800 --> 09:39.009
before Mr. Ulbrich comes back
and socks me in the eye.

09:41.720 --> 09:44.963
Mr. Ulbrich is out of the picture.

09:51.440 --> 09:54.284
- <i>Bonsoir</i>, Henri.
- Oh, Monsieur Keane!

09:54.480 --> 09:56.528
Sorry for not calling first.

09:56.680 --> 10:00.969
Monsieur, your regular table is ready.
Madame,<i> bonsoir. Bienvenue.</i>

10:01.200 --> 10:03.601
Thank you.

10:03.760 --> 10:05.171
And I don't have to pay.

10:05.320 --> 10:07.368
I'm set because
I gave the chef a painting.

10:07.520 --> 10:09.124
- You know what he said?
- What?

10:09.280 --> 10:13.569
He said, "No one paints Montmartre
like Walter Keane!"

10:15.840 --> 10:19.526
I can't believe
you lived in Paris.

10:19.920 --> 10:23.891
Best time of my life.

10:25.720 --> 10:27.848
I've never even
been on an airplane.

10:28.000 --> 10:32.244
Oh, you have to experience these things.
You have to grab them.

10:32.440 --> 10:35.011
I wanted to be an artist,
so I just went!

10:35.160 --> 10:37.527
Studied painting at the Beaux-Arts.

10:37.680 --> 10:41.446
Lived in a Left Bank studio.
Survived on bread and wine.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.570
- You are a romantic.
- Damn right you are.

10:46.240 --> 10:49.961
Of course, walking away
from the bourgeois scene wasn't easy.

10:50.120 --> 10:54.682
I had to quit my job... leave my wife.

10:57.160 --> 11:00.209
Yeah, these choices aren't easy.

11:01.680 --> 11:03.808
I've never acted freely.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.686
I was a daughter, and then a wife,
and then a mother.

11:09.160 --> 11:12.448
All of my paintings are of Jane
because she's all I know.

11:12.600 --> 11:16.924
Don't knock your work.
You have an amazing talent.

11:17.120 --> 11:20.408
You can look at someone
and capture them on canvas.

11:20.560 --> 11:22.767
You can paint people.

11:22.920 --> 11:24.968
I can only paint things.

11:25.160 --> 11:29.210
- Yeah, my street scenes are...
- charming,

11:29.360 --> 11:34.241
but at the end of the clay, they're just
a collection of buildings and sidewalks.

11:35.120 --> 11:38.602
Walter, I bet you can paint anything.

11:41.480 --> 11:45.280
When you look at me like that,
I could fall hard.

11:51.760 --> 11:55.731
I'm sorry.
This is just moving really fast.

11:58.160 --> 12:01.164
I haven't been on
a date in a long time.

12:12.560 --> 12:14.642
Jane, sweetie, stop fidgeting.

12:14.800 --> 12:18.805
Mother, after all this time,
you must know what my face looks like.

12:22.520 --> 12:24.761
Hey. Your canvas is blank.

12:24.920 --> 12:28.049
- You can't rush inspiration.
- Jane.

12:28.200 --> 12:31.329
Don't bother Mr. Keane.
You know creativity comes from within.

12:31.520 --> 12:34.922
Don't worry.
She's not bothering me.

12:44.920 --> 12:47.127
I gotta ask you a question.

12:47.280 --> 12:51.126
- What's that with the big crazy eyes?
- Oh.

12:51.280 --> 12:56.207
Well, I believe that you can see things
in the eyes.

12:56.360 --> 12:59.170
The eyes are the window to the soul.

12:59.320 --> 13:02.483
Yeah, but...
you paint them like pancakes.

13:02.640 --> 13:05.086
They're way out of proportion.

13:05.240 --> 13:08.961
Well, eyes are
how I express my emotions.

13:09.120 --> 13:12.124
I've always drawn them like that.

13:12.280 --> 13:14.931
When I was little, I had surgery
that left me deaf for a period,

13:15.120 --> 13:18.841
and I couldn't hear,
so I found myself staring.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.480
I relied on people's eyes.

13:21.640 --> 13:24.405
Walter?
Hey, Walt!

13:24.560 --> 13:26.562
- I thought that was you!
- Hi, Don.

13:26.760 --> 13:28.205
Boy, am I glad to see you!

13:28.360 --> 13:30.647
Hey, have we heard back
from the city on that setback?

13:30.800 --> 13:33.201
My guys really need the variance
for the first floor retail.

13:33.360 --> 13:36.204
- We'll hear from Permits by Thursday.
- Yeah? That's terrif!

13:36.360 --> 13:40.001
I'll tell the architects. Okay.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.045
What was that?

13:51.480 --> 13:53.323
I didn't want you to know.

13:55.040 --> 13:57.646
I'm in commercial real estate.

13:57.800 --> 14:01.600
- You're a realtor?
- Yeah.

14:01.760 --> 14:04.764
A hugely successful realtor.

14:04.920 --> 14:08.049
Top earner in the downtown office
three years running.

14:08.240 --> 14:11.130
And you're ashamed?

14:11.320 --> 14:14.927
Well, any blockhead
can arrange a sublet.

14:16.480 --> 14:20.485
All I ever wanted was
to support myself as an artist.

14:21.680 --> 14:26.129
I tried to make a clean break,
but couldn't cut it.

14:27.760 --> 14:30.969
I'm just a Sunday painter.

14:34.760 --> 14:39.288
You're such
a gentleman carrying it all the way.

14:43.240 --> 14:45.766
Thank you.
Um, just come right in here.

14:48.480 --> 14:50.687
Just set it down over here.
I just like to...

14:50.840 --> 14:52.604
- Right here?
- Yeah. That's great. I just...

14:52.760 --> 14:55.764
...like to keep it out of the way.

14:55.920 --> 15:01.529
This is... one that I'm working on.

15:01.680 --> 15:05.287
You can see that...
I'm working on it.

15:30.080 --> 15:31.605
I got the mail.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.840
The mail...

15:49.640 --> 15:51.768
What's wrong?

15:52.120 --> 15:56.125
Oh... Um...
Frank wants to take Jane away.

15:56.280 --> 15:59.443
- He says that I'm an unfit mother...
- You're a perfect mother.

15:59.640 --> 16:01.085
Hm...

16:02.520 --> 16:06.684
He told the courts that, um,
she lacks a proper home

16:06.840 --> 16:11.368
and that it is beyond my capabilities
as a single mother...

16:11.520 --> 16:13.124
Marry me.

16:17.720 --> 16:20.405
- Walter! I...
- Shh.

16:20.560 --> 16:22.085
Don't think of a reason to say no,

16:22.240 --> 16:26.290
'cause I've got a million reasons
to say yes.

16:26.440 --> 16:29.250
- I know it makes no sense.
- No, it doesn't...

16:29.400 --> 16:32.244
But just think
of the fun we'll have!

16:32.400 --> 16:35.449
And I'm going to take care of you girls.

16:38.720 --> 16:42.088
- Oh!
- Margaret, I'm on my knee!

16:42.240 --> 16:44.971
Come on, what do you say?
Let's get married.

16:45.120 --> 16:49.842
- We could be in Hawaii by the weekend.
- Oh, Hawaii? Marriage?

16:50.920 --> 16:52.560
I don't know, Walter,
I'm crazy about you.

16:52.680 --> 16:55.763
I'm just really overwhelmed right now.
Why would we go to Hawaii? Why?

16:55.920 --> 17:00.847
Because you're a princess and you
deserve to get married in paradise.

17:20.280 --> 17:24.762
You were right!
It's paradise!

17:24.920 --> 17:28.720
- Only God could create these colors.
- I knew you'd love it.

17:30.520 --> 17:35.606
- Can't we just stay here forever?
- Well, I don't know about forever.

17:35.760 --> 17:38.923
But I guess I could arrange
for another week.

18:17.120 --> 18:20.602
That's that waterfall, and
the air was so fresh you could taste it.

18:20.760 --> 18:22.922
This was, um, an ancient altar.

18:23.120 --> 18:27.284
That's a statue of Kane,
the god of creation.

18:27.600 --> 18:30.206
- Hm!
- I said a prayer to him.

18:30.360 --> 18:33.648
Oh, and that's Walter and Janie,
they built that sandcastle together.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.321
Wow, this is all happening mighty quick.

18:37.520 --> 18:40.649
In the time you moved here, I've had
two dates and you're already married.

18:40.840 --> 18:44.561
Well, I thought there was a void
in my life and Walter filled it.

18:44.720 --> 18:46.165
Walter's filled a lot of things.

18:46.320 --> 18:48.482
He's diddled every skirt
on the art circuit.

18:48.640 --> 18:50.440
That is my husband
that you are talking about.

18:50.520 --> 18:53.967
I know, that's why I brought it up.

18:54.120 --> 18:57.044
- I'm not naive.
- Hm...

18:57.240 --> 19:00.608
I am naive.
But I know who I married.

19:00.760 --> 19:02.808
Walter can be rash,
but he's a good provider.

19:02.960 --> 19:05.486
And he's really wonderful with Jane.

19:05.680 --> 19:09.480
We're just looking to make a fresh
start. I am a divorcee with a child.

19:09.680 --> 19:11.921
Walter is a blessing.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.081
Thanks.

19:28.560 --> 19:33.168
"You are on the threshold
of untold success."

19:33.440 --> 19:36.125
What's brilliant about the composition
is its spontaneity.

19:36.320 --> 19:38.209
The image has no visual center
of attention.

19:38.400 --> 19:40.880
- It's quite gestural.
- Oh, definitely.

19:41.040 --> 19:42.610
Strongly influenced by the Tachistes.

19:43.560 --> 19:46.404
I heard Tab Hunter
was in here looking at one.

19:46.600 --> 19:49.365
Well, I'm not allowed to say, but...

19:55.440 --> 19:57.488
Oh, Christ.

19:57.640 --> 20:00.211
Don't come in here, not now.
Please.

20:00.360 --> 20:03.921
Ruben! Good day!
Do you got a minute?

20:04.120 --> 20:06.805
Walter, in polite society,
the word is "appointment."

20:06.960 --> 20:08.644
Um, I could come back later.

20:09.840 --> 20:12.525
You're gonna
love my stuff today.

20:16.680 --> 20:18.170
Haven't I seen that one before?

20:19.680 --> 20:23.127
No! That was painted
in the 5th Arrondissement.

20:23.320 --> 20:25.766
This is the 6th Arrondissement.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.880
I don't understand.
You lived in Paris for a week.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.490
How can you still
be cranking out paintings?

20:29.640 --> 20:33.042
It's all up here.
And here.

20:33.200 --> 20:34.531
Well, it's not going up here.

20:34.680 --> 20:37.411
Walter, you know we don't go
for that representational jazz.

20:37.560 --> 20:38.971
You're too literal.

20:39.120 --> 20:41.088
- Art isn't fashion.
- Yes, it is.

20:41.240 --> 20:46.883
People want Kandinsky or Rothko.
They don't want goopy street scenes.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.047
How about this?

21:02.160 --> 21:04.208
Good God!
You've entered a new period.

21:05.880 --> 21:09.202
No. They're my wife's.

21:12.040 --> 21:14.361
Why are their eyes so big?

21:14.520 --> 21:18.081
- Like big, stale jellybeans.
- It's Expressionism.

21:18.240 --> 21:20.561
Surely, you recognize it.

21:22.040 --> 21:25.089
Well, I'm just glad
you two found each other.

21:25.560 --> 21:27.005
So what do you say?

21:27.200 --> 21:30.044
- I say no. It's not art.
- "It's not art"?

21:30.240 --> 21:32.242
It's like the back of a magazine.
You know, "Draw the turtle!

21:32.440 --> 21:34.044
Send in a nickel,
win the big contest!"

21:34.240 --> 21:36.163
How dare you!
Lots of people will like this.

21:36.320 --> 21:38.766
Well, nobody who's walking
through the doors of this gallery.

21:38.960 --> 21:42.931
Now, please, clear out the clutter
before the taste police arrive.

21:59.880 --> 22:01.689
We'll never break in!

22:02.320 --> 22:05.164
There's a secret society
of gallery owners and critics

22:05.320 --> 22:09.370
who get together for Sunday brunch
in Sausalito deciding what's "cool."

22:09.520 --> 22:11.887
Like McCarthy, in his hearings:

22:12.080 --> 22:17.086
"I anoint that painter.
I banish that painter to Nowheresville."

22:18.120 --> 22:22.045
I think people buy art
because it touches them.

22:22.240 --> 22:25.050
Yeah, you're living in fairyland.

22:25.200 --> 22:27.965
People don't get to discover anything.

22:28.120 --> 22:31.488
They buy art because it's
in the right place at the right time.

22:34.160 --> 22:37.050
Okay, give it up for Cal Tjader!

22:37.200 --> 22:40.761
<i>That set was humming!</i>

22:40.960 --> 22:44.681
All right, be sure to stick around
for the 1 a.m. show!

22:48.800 --> 22:54.648
Oh, Yeah-Enjoy yourself.
Enjoy. See you again.

22:54.800 --> 22:56.131
Excuse me.

22:56.280 --> 22:59.921
Hey, Banducci. I love the music tonight.
It's a gas.

23:00.080 --> 23:04.768
- Oh, thanks. Thank you.
- Walter Keane. I'm a painter.

23:04.960 --> 23:08.931
I was looking at your walls.
They're pretty plain.

23:09.080 --> 23:12.766
Oh. Well, maybe you're right.
What color were you thinking?

23:12.920 --> 23:16.811
No, no, I'm an artist.
I used to be based on the Left Bank.

23:16.960 --> 23:22.091
Now I've relocated to the States
and I'm looking for, um...

23:22.240 --> 23:24.402
an exhibition venue.

23:24.560 --> 23:26.244
I like my club the way it is.

23:26.480 --> 23:29.404
Your stuff is so hot,
go put it in a museum.

23:29.560 --> 23:34.043
Okay. I respect that.
You're a businessman, not a charity.

23:34.200 --> 23:39.684
How about if I rented your walls?

24:01.440 --> 24:03.966
Walter, Margaret, we're ready.

24:16.360 --> 24:20.809
Ah, an art lover! Beautiful!
What can I do for you, sir?

24:20.960 --> 24:22.849
I'm just looking for the john.

24:24.800 --> 24:26.086
Thanks.

24:28.560 --> 24:32.451
I think you're going
to have to ask him.

24:32.600 --> 24:34.409
Honestly, I think you...
How did you find him?

24:34.560 --> 24:37.006
Oh, it was easy...

24:56.680 --> 24:59.365
No!

25:02.040 --> 25:03.724
Look at that child.

25:04.800 --> 25:06.928
She's so sad.

25:07.960 --> 25:11.521
- Is she poor?
- She's forgotten.

25:11.680 --> 25:13.808
It just makes me want to cry.

25:17.200 --> 25:20.522
- Are you Keane?
- Yes, I am.

25:20.680 --> 25:23.160
Well, you're a hell of a painter.

25:23.320 --> 25:26.244
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

25:26.400 --> 25:28.402
Your work is very powerful.

25:29.680 --> 25:34.083
There's so much emotion in those eyes.
Mm!

25:35.560 --> 25:39.121
- Is something wrong?
- No.

25:39.280 --> 25:42.682
- I didn't realize you meant that waif.
- Oh, I get it.

25:42.840 --> 25:47.004
The artist doesn't wanna part
with his favorite piece.

25:47.160 --> 25:49.925
Oh, sweetie, thank you! I love it!

25:52.560 --> 25:55.245
I'll be quick.

26:04.280 --> 26:06.567
Ladies.

26:06.720 --> 26:10.042
Hey, Picasso!
Nice crowd, huh?

26:10.200 --> 26:13.204
You wouldn't know it
from that broom closet you parked me in.

26:13.360 --> 26:15.966
What are you talking about?
That's prime thoroughfare.

26:16.120 --> 26:17.849
People drink,
they gotta relieve themselves.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.970
That's insulting! When people see art,
they shouldn't think of shit!

26:21.120 --> 26:24.886
Hey! Watch it with the purple language.
Hey, there's ladies present here!

26:25.040 --> 26:26.371
Hey!

26:31.400 --> 26:34.006
Oh!

26:41.000 --> 26:43.162
I've never posted bail before.

26:43.320 --> 26:46.608
I'm sorry. Banducci laughed at our art,
so I socked him.

26:46.760 --> 26:49.366
Since when are you thin-skinned?
Artists have to handle criticism.

26:49.520 --> 26:53.320
I know. You're right.
But I was in a bad place already.

26:53.480 --> 26:57.405
I'd had a couple, then I made some guy
believe I painted your big eyes.

26:57.560 --> 27:01.485
What? I don't understand.
Why would you do such a thing?

27:01.680 --> 27:05.924
It was a misunderstanding. And then,
I didn't want to jinx the sale.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.685
Well, don't ever do it again.

27:19.320 --> 27:20.924
- Hey!
- Don't give me a hard time.

27:21.080 --> 27:22.491
I'm just grabbing my stuff.

27:27.720 --> 27:31.247
Can you believe it? We're sold out!
I don't even have a headliner!

27:31.400 --> 27:33.323
Hell, it's a Monday!

27:33.480 --> 27:36.802
Walter, we made the front page.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.731
People are here because
they wanna see the sappy paintings

27:39.960 --> 27:42.327
that made grown men fight.

27:43.920 --> 27:46.764
- I'm sick of you, Keane!
- I'll see you in court,

27:46.960 --> 27:49.120
- you son of a bitch!
- You're gonna see me, all right.

27:49.160 --> 27:52.881
- I'll sue you for assault!
- I'm sick of you and your paintings!

27:53.080 --> 27:56.687
I'll... I'll sue you for slander!
And false arrest!

27:56.840 --> 27:59.764
- You son of a bitch!
- Let's go see.

28:09.920 --> 28:12.491
<i>Walter Keane
was not a subtle man.</i>

28:12.640 --> 28:15.041
<i>But subtle doesn't sell.</i>

28:17.120 --> 28:18.485
Yes, sir.

28:18.640 --> 28:22.281
That was quite a load of horseshit
you gents were laying out there.

28:22.440 --> 28:24.090
Dick Nolan. <i>The Examiner.</i>

28:25.480 --> 28:29.883
Hey, pal, don't lose any sleep.
I eat this stuff up with a spoon.

28:30.040 --> 28:31.929
Gives me something to write about
in my column.

28:32.080 --> 28:35.050
I thought you were only
doing celebrities.

28:35.200 --> 28:37.771
Well, Banducci's famous
and you hit him.

28:37.920 --> 28:41.641
So you're a celebrity, once removed.
Buy me a drink.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.288
Hey, Gary. I'll have a Ward Eight
in a frosted highboy.

28:47.440 --> 28:49.488
And my friend will have the same.

28:53.360 --> 28:57.331
So, Walter,
tell me about your work.

28:59.080 --> 29:02.129
- When I was in Paris...
- Oh, no, Jesus, not those.

29:03.920 --> 29:06.207
I mean the little hobo kids.

29:22.280 --> 29:25.727
- Mm...
- Wake up!

29:25.880 --> 29:27.962
Wake up!

29:28.160 --> 29:32.051
- Mm... Hi.
- You were a hit!

29:32.240 --> 29:36.325
What a night!
I sold out all your big eyes!

29:36.480 --> 29:39.927
- There must be $200!
- They adore you!

29:40.120 --> 29:41.724
- Walter!
- Because of that article,

29:41.960 --> 29:44.327
the joint was packed!

29:44.480 --> 29:49.520
And then a famous journalist showed up,
and... I need more paintings!

29:49.760 --> 29:51.603
- Walter!
- Now!

29:51.760 --> 29:55.685
That's gonna take at least a week!
I need to do sketching and painting...

29:58.200 --> 30:00.965
Of course!
But this is an opportunity!

30:01.120 --> 30:03.964
- Yeah.
- We're gonna make a crackerjack team.

30:04.120 --> 30:08.284
Me schmoozing up the clubs, while you're
back here, doing what you love!

30:19.960 --> 30:22.201
Get out of there!

30:28.680 --> 30:30.489
I love you.

31:33.560 --> 31:35.881
The eyes are so powerful.

31:36.080 --> 31:37.889
You know, a poet once said

31:38.080 --> 31:41.289
the eyes are the windows of the soul.

31:41.440 --> 31:44.250
That's why I paint them so big.
I've always done it that way.

31:44.400 --> 31:48.610
If you're interested in that style,
I'm working on a few new pieces.

31:48.800 --> 31:54.364
I have a little blond girl in a yellow
dress that'll tear your heart out.

31:54.600 --> 31:56.204
Walter?

31:56.360 --> 31:58.408
Baby!
What are you doing here?

32:00.160 --> 32:01.844
Why are you lying?

32:03.120 --> 32:05.009
Excuse me.

32:06.800 --> 32:08.962
You were taking credit for something
that isn't yours.

32:09.120 --> 32:11.885
No.
I was just trying to close the deal.

32:12.040 --> 32:13.804
These children are a part of my being.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.322
I'm a salesman. You know buyers
pay more if they meet the painter.

32:17.480 --> 32:20.563
They couldn't meet me
because you told me to stay home.

32:20.760 --> 32:24.321
Look, we're making money. Your pocket,
my pocket? Where's the difference?

32:24.480 --> 32:27.245
- You're taking this so lightly.
- Not at all!

32:27.400 --> 32:30.131
This is not about ego.
You wanna say you did the street scenes?

32:30.280 --> 32:32.567
Fine. I don't care.
Say a monkey painted them.

32:33.440 --> 32:35.204
Well, I'm glad that you
can just dash away your work

32:35.360 --> 32:37.488
without any emotional connection,
but...

32:37.680 --> 32:42.368
Oh, honey, I just want to share them
with the world.

32:42.560 --> 32:45.040
Would you rather have your children
piled in a closet,

32:45.200 --> 32:47.487
or hanging in someone's living room?

32:55.200 --> 32:56.406
Who's that man?

32:56.560 --> 32:59.370
That is Dino Olivetti,
of Olivetti typewriters.

32:59.520 --> 33:02.524
But don't even think about it, Walter.
He doesn't speak a lick of English.

33:02.680 --> 33:05.445
Hey! Welcome!

33:05.600 --> 33:09.685
Good to see you, good to see you.

33:30.720 --> 33:34.122
Um, Mr. Olivetti is enchanted
by the painting.

33:34.320 --> 33:36.846
He would like to know
who is the artist?

33:53.960 --> 33:55.849
I am!

33:56.000 --> 34:00.642
It's a delight to meet you, Signore!

34:00.800 --> 34:03.041
Have you been
an art lover for long?

34:03.200 --> 34:05.567
I call this piece...

34:28.560 --> 34:30.641
Five grand!

34:30.800 --> 34:34.009
We made $5,000!

34:34.159 --> 34:36.731
And it wasn't even
for one of your good ones!

34:36.880 --> 34:40.726
- Don't you mean one of your good ones?
- No. No, no! No.

34:40.880 --> 34:43.451
All right, "our."
One of our good ones.

34:43.639 --> 34:47.964
We're now hanging in the collection
of Italian industrialist Dino Olivetti.

34:48.120 --> 34:53.489
With his patronage comes credibility,
and with credibility comes respect.

34:53.639 --> 34:55.960
- Well, what about honesty?
- Oh, come on.

34:56.120 --> 35:01.081
The painting says "Keane."
I'm Keane, you're Keane.

35:01.280 --> 35:04.409
From now on, we're one and the same.

35:04.560 --> 35:08.121
Mm...

35:12.280 --> 35:17.571
<i>My sources tell me that the mayor
is to expect a big surprise today.</i>

35:17.760 --> 35:20.286
On behalf of the children of the world,

35:20.440 --> 35:24.684
I present this painting
to the mayor of San Francisco!

35:27.240 --> 35:28.680
<i>My man on the street tells me</i>

35:28.800 --> 35:31.644
<i>that the Soviet ambassador's
in town this week.</i>

35:32.400 --> 35:34.528
In the interest of peace
through culture,

35:34.680 --> 35:38.446
I donate this painting to the people
of the Soviet Union.

35:40.520 --> 35:45.845
The Purple Onion. 9:30.
Joan Crawford has a dinner reservation.

35:48.720 --> 35:52.361
Miss Crawford, in recognition
of your cinematic craft,

35:52.520 --> 35:55.046
we bestow this painting on you.

35:58.680 --> 36:00.284
<i>The cat is out of the bag.</i>

36:00.440 --> 36:03.808
<i>I can reveal that our local luminary,
Walter Keane,</i>

36:03.960 --> 36:06.167
<i>is opening his own gallery.</i>

36:11.360 --> 36:13.522
Ruben's gonna choke
when he sees this.

36:16.040 --> 36:18.008
I remember when Mama painted that.

36:23.880 --> 36:26.884
Are you sure?
That would have been a while ago.

36:27.080 --> 36:29.367
Sure I'm sure.
It was in our old apartment,

36:29.520 --> 36:31.124
and you had me sit on the stool
in the kitchen.

36:31.280 --> 36:35.205
No, sweetie, you're confused.
I painted that.

36:35.360 --> 36:38.091
No, Mother did.
I'm wearing my blue dress.

36:39.560 --> 36:41.847
Lots of girls have that dress.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.287
You have a good eye.

36:44.440 --> 36:48.161
I painted it, but I tried
to mimic your mother's style.

36:48.320 --> 36:51.244
You know,
the style she used to paint in.

36:53.320 --> 36:55.004
Well, you did a really good job.

37:13.360 --> 37:14.964
Hello.

37:15.120 --> 37:19.045
I'm sorry, I've never done this before,
so urn, don't know...

37:19.840 --> 37:22.650
I was raised Methodist,
so if that's a problem, I can go.

37:22.840 --> 37:26.287
No, no, please.
We don't chase people away.

37:26.480 --> 37:30.280
- Okay.
- What is troubling you?

37:31.320 --> 37:36.247
Well, um... I lied to my child.

37:37.040 --> 37:39.520
Why would you do that?

37:39.680 --> 37:42.809
My husband,
he pressured me to do it.

37:43.000 --> 37:46.083
I've just never lied to her before.
I'm not that kind of person.

37:46.320 --> 37:48.288
Is your husband
that kind of person?

37:50.480 --> 37:53.484
Um, I don't think of him that way.

37:53.640 --> 37:56.849
I mean, he likes to tell stories.
Maybe he exaggerates a bit,

37:57.040 --> 37:59.691
but, um, he's a good man,

37:59.880 --> 38:03.282
and he's just trying to save enough
money to buy a house for the family.

38:03.440 --> 38:07.889
But what of the child?
Will this lie bring harm to her?

38:08.040 --> 38:12.568
Harm?
No, no. No. I don't...

38:14.000 --> 38:16.685
I'm just looking for some answers.

38:18.040 --> 38:20.964
Well, the modern world
is a complicated place.

38:21.160 --> 38:23.891
- Mm-hm.
- Occasionally, children may need

38:24.040 --> 38:26.691
to be sheltered from certain truths.

38:26.840 --> 38:29.844
No. No, it's not like...

38:30.000 --> 38:31.490
It sounds as if your husband

38:31.640 --> 38:35.042
is trying to make the best
of an imperfect situation.

38:35.240 --> 38:38.926
You were raised Christian,
you know what we are taught:

38:39.080 --> 38:41.401
the man is head of the household.

38:41.560 --> 38:45.406
Perhaps you should...
trust his judgment.

38:53.560 --> 38:56.370
I think it's creepy,
maudlin and amateurish.

38:56.560 --> 38:59.848
Exactly.
I love it.

39:05.200 --> 39:08.488
- We got in early. We own three.
- Oh.

39:10.600 --> 39:12.329
Thanks.

39:12.480 --> 39:15.768
Hey...

39:17.560 --> 39:21.770
Hey, baby.
Killer party. It's a happening.

39:21.960 --> 39:24.042
So where's your stuff?

39:24.200 --> 39:27.921
Oh, uh, we decided that this
would just be Walter's show.

39:28.080 --> 39:31.448
Oh, "we" did?
Why would "we" do that?

39:31.600 --> 39:34.444
Because Walter is more established.

39:34.640 --> 39:38.201
It's strange, you know,
Walter doesn't really strike me

39:38.400 --> 39:40.687
as the cute, hungry kitten type.

39:42.640 --> 39:46.804
It's really good to see you.
Thank you for coming.

39:52.440 --> 39:55.489
Your husband's quite a talent.

39:56.400 --> 39:58.528
Do you paint, too?

40:00.280 --> 40:04.569
Uh, I don't know.

40:13.080 --> 40:16.607
I'm curious about your technique.
How long did that piece take to execute?

40:16.800 --> 40:20.327
That?
Mm. Probably months.

40:20.560 --> 40:22.961
You know, first the thinking,
the sketching,

40:23.120 --> 40:26.249
then the time with
just me and the oils.

40:26.440 --> 40:29.091
Oils?
But isn't that acrylic?

40:29.280 --> 40:31.760
Oh, that! Yeah.

40:32.000 --> 40:35.721
Yeah, it's like a jumble of ideas

40:35.960 --> 40:38.440
rattling around in my brain.

40:40.320 --> 40:42.402
So where do you get your ideas?

40:44.960 --> 40:47.247
What do you mean?

40:47.400 --> 40:52.122
I mean... why are they
all images of children?

40:54.680 --> 40:57.047
<i>May I remind you, Miss Rogers,
that you're still under oath.</i>

41:00.120 --> 41:01.963
<i>Miss Rogers,</i>

41:02.120 --> 41:04.282
<i>you testified that</i>

41:04.480 --> 41:06.403
<i>when you met Judson Bailey
in Corelli's,</i>

41:06.560 --> 41:08.847
<i>you'd been talking to a man at the bar.</i>

41:09.000 --> 41:11.731
<i>- Well, I don't understand.
- Couldn't he have been some stranger</i>

41:11.880 --> 41:14.611
<i>who just struck up a conversation
with Mr. Bailey?</i>

41:14.800 --> 41:18.122
<i>- No!
- Thank you, Mrs. Stone. That?! be all.</i>

41:18.280 --> 41:20.886
<i>Perry Mason
will return after this.</i>

41:21.680 --> 41:23.887
New York Times
<i>art critic John Canaday</i>

41:24.080 --> 41:26.481
<i>with a perspective
into the work of Walter Keane.</i>

41:27.360 --> 41:30.523
<i>Keane's work is completely
without distinction.</i>

41:30.720 --> 41:33.644
<i>He is not a member
of the Society of Western Artists.</i>

41:33.840 --> 41:35.080
<i>He has won no awards.</i>

41:35.280 --> 41:40.810
<i>He's only noteworthy for his appearances
in a certain newspaper's gossip columns.</i>

41:40.960 --> 41:44.328
<i>Mr. Keane is why society
needs critics</i>

41:44.560 --> 41:48.007
<i>to protect them from such atrocities.</i>

41:48.160 --> 41:50.322
Mom!

41:50.480 --> 41:51.925
Mom!

41:52.120 --> 41:54.168
Can I come in?

41:54.360 --> 41:58.809
Uh... no, you can't.
Mama's busy right now.

42:00.960 --> 42:02.371
What are you doing in there?

42:11.360 --> 42:13.362
Janie, sweetie, come.

42:13.520 --> 42:16.808
You need to respect
your mother's privacy.

42:16.960 --> 42:21.761
Sometimes grownups
need alone time. Come.

42:29.240 --> 42:32.005
Is that the ice cream truck?

42:36.760 --> 42:39.366
Go get yourself a Fudgsicle.

42:47.160 --> 42:51.404
Ooh! Out of this world!

42:51.640 --> 42:54.644
I don't know.
I'm not comfortable with this.

42:54.840 --> 42:57.207
Jane and I used to be really close,
and now...

42:57.360 --> 43:00.364
Eh, Jane's fine.
She's eating ice cream.

43:00.560 --> 43:04.485
She has new shoes.
She even has a college fund.

43:04.680 --> 43:08.765
Maybe... I'm just lightheaded
from all this turpentine.

43:08.920 --> 43:12.402
- I've been up here all day.
- I need your help.

43:12.560 --> 43:15.928
I want to go on television
to defend our art.

43:17.280 --> 43:21.001
- Wait, you're going on television?
- Yeah, but what am I gonna say?

43:21.240 --> 43:26.849
Meaning, what compels me
to paint these paintings?

43:28.520 --> 43:31.000
Maybe you have an unhealthy obsession
with little girls.

43:31.160 --> 43:34.482
- Cute.
- I'm sorry.

43:34.680 --> 43:37.445
Looks like you've painted yourself
into a corner.

43:37.640 --> 43:40.325
You want heat this winter?

43:40.480 --> 43:41.845
Help me out.

43:42.040 --> 43:44.008
Walter, art is personal.

43:48.280 --> 43:51.602
What compels a grown man
to paint a picture like this?

43:51.800 --> 43:56.488
Because I... I grew up
surrounded by six sisters?

43:56.640 --> 43:59.723
I grew up in an orphanage?

43:59.880 --> 44:04.169
I lived in a world
where adults had vanished

44:04.320 --> 44:07.483
and kids and kittens ran wild

44:07.640 --> 44:10.086
over a desolate landscape?

44:11.520 --> 44:13.966
What about your street scenes?
Why did you paint those?

44:14.120 --> 44:17.966
Well, I lived it. I experienced it.

44:18.120 --> 44:20.885
Oh, was it all sunlit-dappled streets
and flower vendors?

44:21.040 --> 44:24.408
Of course not.
It was after the war.

44:29.720 --> 44:32.451
There was destruction everywhere.

44:34.320 --> 44:38.370
I traveled the continent.

44:38.560 --> 44:41.040
The ravages were horrifying.

44:41.240 --> 44:44.767
<i>My psyche was scarred
in my art student days.</i>

44:44.960 --> 44:49.443
<i>Nothing in my life
has ever made such an impact</i>

44:49.600 --> 44:52.001
as the sight of the children.

44:52.200 --> 44:55.090
The war-wracked innocents,

44:55.280 --> 44:57.408
without parents, without homes,

44:57.560 --> 45:00.404
fighting over garbage.

45:00.600 --> 45:03.410
That's where my life

45:03.560 --> 45:07.121
as a painter began in earnest.

45:09.400 --> 45:15.203
From then on, I painted the lost children
with the big eyes.

45:16.800 --> 45:21.283
Those eyes that forever will retain
their haunting quality.

45:32.320 --> 45:36.120
Mr. Keane!

45:48.800 --> 45:52.202
Thank you so much.

45:52.360 --> 45:54.362
Thank you.

45:56.800 --> 45:58.325
Mr. Keane.

46:00.800 --> 46:05.010
- How many sales today?
- Sales? None with this crowd.

46:05.160 --> 46:08.767
These people are all looky-loos.
They can't afford these paintings.

46:08.920 --> 46:11.082
But we have been giving away
a lot of posters.

46:20.720 --> 46:22.961
It's the craziest thing.

46:23.120 --> 46:26.169
I started charging for the posters.

46:26.320 --> 46:28.721
First a nickel, then a dime.

46:28.880 --> 46:31.963
Yes, Maggie! It's cuckoo!

46:32.800 --> 46:34.245
But then it got me thinking.

46:34.400 --> 46:37.006
Would you rather
sell one $500 painting

46:37.160 --> 46:39.766
or a million cheaply reproduced posters?

46:39.920 --> 46:44.608
See, folks don't care if it's a copy.
They just want art that touches them.

46:44.760 --> 46:47.491
Then we could sell it anywhere.

46:47.640 --> 46:49.404
Everywhere!

48:34.400 --> 48:36.846
It stinks in here.
You should open a window.

48:37.000 --> 48:40.288
- What time is it?
- 6:30.

48:40.440 --> 48:42.249
What do you got back there?
Let me see.

48:42.440 --> 48:43.930
Oh, Walter, it's personal.

48:44.080 --> 48:45.923
Personal?
We're married.

48:46.080 --> 48:47.844
We're not supposed to have secrets
from each other.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.970
Come on, put it up there.
Put it up there.

49:00.440 --> 49:02.442
It's a completely different style.

49:03.560 --> 49:04.800
Yes, it is.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.002
It kind of looks like you.

49:07.160 --> 49:10.562
Well, it's a self-portrait.

49:14.880 --> 49:16.723
How am I gonna explain that?

49:16.880 --> 49:19.201
I was thinking that...

49:21.240 --> 49:23.766
...maybe I could sign it myself.

49:23.920 --> 49:27.049
That sounds a bit confusing,
doesn't it?

49:27.200 --> 49:28.770
"Keane" means me.

49:28.920 --> 49:31.810
I know, but when people ask me
if I paint,

49:31.960 --> 49:33.849
I don't know how to answer
and it would be nice

49:34.000 --> 49:36.446
to have the pride of being able to say,
"That's mine."

49:36.600 --> 49:39.410
- Who'd you tell about the big eyes?
- Nobody.

49:39.560 --> 49:43.326
If you tell anyone,
this empire collapses!

49:43.480 --> 49:47.166
Do you wanna give back the money?
We've committed fraud!

49:47.320 --> 49:49.527
I know!

49:49.760 --> 49:53.765
My God, I know! I live with this
every minute of my life!

49:53.960 --> 49:57.123
I've kept my end of the bargain.

49:57.280 --> 50:00.966
I have not told anyone.

50:01.760 --> 50:06.004
Please.
Just let me have this.

50:06.600 --> 50:08.648
I didn't know you painted, Margaret.

50:08.800 --> 50:10.928
Yeah, we don't talk about it.

50:12.040 --> 50:14.566
Sadly, people don't buy lady art.

50:14.720 --> 50:16.370
What about Georgia O'Keeffe?

50:19.640 --> 50:21.961
So, Margaret,
where do you get your ideas?

50:22.880 --> 50:26.566
Oh, um, well, from the world around me.

50:26.760 --> 50:30.207
And I just love Modigliani's

50:30.360 --> 50:31.486
- use of line.
- Modi-what?

50:31.640 --> 50:33.961
- Modigliani.
- For Christ's sake, Margaret.

50:34.120 --> 50:36.930
Dick writes a gossip column.
Stick to the family angle.

50:37.160 --> 50:39.288
Get a gander at little
Janie over here.

50:39.480 --> 50:43.644
What a talent!
Look at these Keanes.

50:43.880 --> 50:46.326
When you cut open our veins,
we bleed oil.

50:54.400 --> 50:55.970
Ah! A little treat!

50:57.000 --> 51:00.607
The fourth member
of the Painting Keanes.

51:00.760 --> 51:03.684
Lily, sweetie, how are you?

51:03.840 --> 51:06.002
- I'm fine, Dad.
- Good.

51:06.160 --> 51:08.970
- I lost a tooth.
- Really?

51:09.120 --> 51:10.929
Did you get in a fight?

51:11.080 --> 51:12.570
No, it fell out.

51:12.720 --> 51:16.645
Well, is the tooth fairy something
I gotta deal with,

51:16.840 --> 51:18.729
or did your mom already handle it?

51:18.880 --> 51:20.211
She handled it.

51:20.360 --> 51:23.648
Mm... Good! Good, good!

51:23.800 --> 51:27.850
Janie, come.
Come, show her the kids' room.

51:28.000 --> 51:33.086
And then you girls can join the fun.

51:37.160 --> 51:41.165
Walter, you never told me
you had another daughter.

51:42.880 --> 51:46.202
Didn't I? Sure.
Lily's from my first marriage.

51:46.360 --> 51:47.600
Oh.

51:50.600 --> 51:52.011
Excuse me.

51:52.160 --> 51:53.889
I'm sorry, excuse me.

51:56.040 --> 51:59.522
Walter?
May I have a word with you?

52:03.680 --> 52:06.001
- What is going on in there?
- That's Lily.

52:06.160 --> 52:10.006
- I'm sure I mentioned her.
- No, you didn't.

52:11.040 --> 52:13.520
- Is she moving in?
- No!

52:13.680 --> 52:15.728
Her mother's going to Vegas
for the weekend.

52:15.880 --> 52:18.840
I'm supposed to have her once a month,
but I don't make her mom enforce it.

52:18.920 --> 52:20.843
How could you lie
about something so big?

52:21.000 --> 52:23.401
- Oh, she's a very sweet girl.
- I'm sure she is.

52:23.560 --> 52:27.007
Well, I put up with your daughter
and never said a peep.

52:27.560 --> 52:30.166
I'm gonna pretend you
didn't say that. Okay?

52:30.320 --> 52:32.687
I'm sorry. Sorry.

52:32.840 --> 52:35.571
Please, let's just get through this.

52:41.320 --> 52:43.482
Any connoisseur
of fine art can tell you,

52:43.680 --> 52:47.480
Walter Keane and Paul Gauguin
have a lot in common.

52:47.680 --> 52:51.321
Both walked away from a career
to travel the globe.

52:51.520 --> 52:52.760
Frankly, I'm...

52:52.920 --> 52:55.048
<i>I've known a lot
of famous personalities,</i>

52:55.200 --> 52:58.602
<i>and only a certain type of creature
can live in that spotlight.</i>

52:58.760 --> 52:59.807
<i>Walter had the chops.</i>

52:59.960 --> 53:03.009
<i>Margaret? Not so much.</i>

53:05.720 --> 53:07.882
- I painted that.
- Really?

53:08.080 --> 53:09.445
Hm...

53:09.600 --> 53:12.206
It's very... evocative.

53:14.120 --> 53:16.122
Sensual.

53:17.840 --> 53:19.001
Oh.

53:21.240 --> 53:22.446
"MDH"?

53:24.840 --> 53:28.162
You're so... mysterioso.

53:29.640 --> 53:32.405
Yes. We don't use my name,

53:32.600 --> 53:35.649
since people don't
take women's art seriously.

53:35.800 --> 53:38.201
"MDH" are my initials.

53:38.400 --> 53:41.529
And more.
I'm really interested in numerology,

53:41.680 --> 53:44.331
and, as you know,
seven is a very good number.

53:44.480 --> 53:47.324
- Seven?
- Mm. Luckily, my maiden name

53:47.480 --> 53:48.641
is Margaret Doris Hawkins.

53:48.800 --> 53:50.962
"M" is the 13th letter
of the alphabet,

53:51.160 --> 53:52.730
"D" is four, "H" eight.

53:52.880 --> 53:54.962
And if you add up one
and three of 13...

53:55.120 --> 54:00.411
...an orgy of color and sun...
sunshine. Excuse me.

54:00.560 --> 54:04.645
...which makes
four plus four plus eight equals 16,

54:04.840 --> 54:06.808
and then one plus six equals seven.

54:06.960 --> 54:10.203
- Maggie? One second.
- Mm-hm.

54:12.200 --> 54:15.841
Good grief! What are you babbling about?
Long division?

54:16.000 --> 54:18.685
Could you please help the world
and shut your mouth?

54:18.840 --> 54:22.162
The only number you want in his head
is the price.

54:22.480 --> 54:25.768
Two nuts that fell from the same tree.
It's insufferable.

54:25.920 --> 54:27.729
Why are we starving
while they print money?

54:27.880 --> 54:30.690
Because that nut's a genius.
He sells paintings.

54:30.840 --> 54:32.400
Then he sells
pictures of the paintings.

54:32.440 --> 54:35.125
Then he sells postcards of pictures
of the paintings.

54:35.280 --> 54:37.681
I'll bet I could bang one out
in ten minutes.

54:37.840 --> 54:42.004
- It wouldn't have the dopey sincerity.
- Ah, the customers won't notice.

54:47.560 --> 54:49.528
Christ. It's a movement.

55:19.200 --> 55:20.929
Oh. Dee-Ann!

55:21.080 --> 55:23.606
My God! I thought
I had the wrong address.

55:23.760 --> 55:26.525
I know,
it's a really long driveway.

55:27.520 --> 55:29.841
Honestly, I can't believe I live here.

55:30.000 --> 55:32.162
- Whoa.
- I know.

55:32.320 --> 55:37.042
We've got two acres,
a pool, five bedrooms.

55:37.200 --> 55:39.362
Though I thought that was excessive,

55:39.560 --> 55:43.246
since there's only
three of us here.

55:43.480 --> 55:46.006
It's been so long
since I've seen you.

55:46.320 --> 55:47.924
I know.

55:48.080 --> 55:50.651
North Beach is 30 miles,
might as well be 300.

55:50.800 --> 55:54.646
Well, you're probably busy hanging out
with all your new rich buddies.

55:54.800 --> 55:58.521
Please. Those are Walter's friends.
He brings people by.

55:58.680 --> 56:02.480
- The Beach Boys came by.
- Wow.

56:04.440 --> 56:08.764
- Are you hungry?
- I'm thirsty.

56:08.920 --> 56:12.163
When we moved in, I thought that
a wet bar was kind of extravagant,

56:12.320 --> 56:16.041
but you'd be surprised
how much use you can get out of it.

56:16.200 --> 56:21.730
- So how is Walter?
- Oh. Well, he couldn't be happier.

56:21.880 --> 56:23.405
He has everything
he's ever dreamed of.

56:23.560 --> 56:26.848
And so do you. Fabulous.

56:30.840 --> 56:32.649
Is that your art studio?

56:32.800 --> 56:35.644
Oh. No, you don't wanna go in there.

56:35.800 --> 56:37.131
I wanna take a peek.

56:37.280 --> 56:40.921
I wanna see what the workspace of
a wildly successful artist looks like.

56:41.120 --> 56:43.122
No, no, no. No.

56:43.280 --> 56:45.408
Dee-Ann, please do not go down there.

56:45.560 --> 56:49.645
Look... Look, you can't go in there.

56:54.200 --> 56:56.248
Walter paints here, too.

56:58.120 --> 56:59.565
Is Walter home now?

57:01.120 --> 57:05.091
- What the hell's going on?
- Oh. Nothing. Um...

57:06.280 --> 57:10.046
I just... invited Dee-Ann over
for some...

57:11.120 --> 57:15.011
You know I don't like anyone
seeing my work before it's done!

57:34.680 --> 57:38.207
You and your whole
non-representational crowd are frauds!

57:38.360 --> 57:40.647
Shut up!
You're so full of shit, Walter!

57:40.800 --> 57:43.326
Get outta my house!
Get out of my big house!

57:43.520 --> 57:47.969
Go back to selling your coat hanger
sculptures in Fisherman's Wharf!

57:48.120 --> 57:50.202
Fuck you!

57:55.120 --> 57:57.646
I don't want her ever
invited here again.

57:58.320 --> 57:59.890
I won't.

58:04.840 --> 58:07.366
- Oh, you gonna get that ball?
- Good boy. Oh!

58:07.520 --> 58:11.684
Oh! Good boy.
All right, Janie, I'm gonna get to work.

58:11.880 --> 58:15.009
Can I come?
No, I can never come.

58:15.160 --> 58:17.447
No, I shouldn't even ask.

58:33.880 --> 58:35.644
Now, how did you get in here? Hm?

58:35.800 --> 58:40.169
Didn't you hear?
There are no visitors.

58:41.880 --> 58:44.042
This is what it's come to, huh?

58:44.200 --> 58:47.921
You are the only living soul
I can tell my secret to.

58:48.080 --> 58:52.881
Well... I painted them.

58:53.040 --> 58:55.691
I did.
Every single one of them.

58:55.880 --> 58:58.724
Every big eye. Me.

58:59.520 --> 59:01.522
And no one will
ever know but you.

59:03.440 --> 59:05.886
And I'm gonna paint
another one right now.

59:06.040 --> 59:11.251
To tick Walter off, maybe I'll paint one
about a crazy girl talking to a dog.

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:28.165
I had a productive day today.

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:32.285
Stumbled onto some hot gossip.

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:37.407
Madame Chiang Kai-shek is coming
to town, straight from Taipei.

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:41.762
I think we should present her
with a painting.

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:44.969
Get Dick to flack it.

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:48.926
Or the hell with Dick.
I met a new guy at UPI.

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:52.761
Maybe, uh... she'd like one
of your street scenes.

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:57.409
Yeah, I don't know. I thought you could
whip off a doodle of Chinatown.

01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:01.645
With a cute little girl,
sort of a big-eyed, slanty-eyed thing.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.684
No.

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:08.686
No, no. She is a dignitary,
and she deserves a piece

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:10.524
that comes straight from you.

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:14.444
- You think?
- Uh-huh.

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:15.931
Maybe you're right.

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:20.404
She probably doesn't have a Parisian
street scene hanging in her palace.

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:23.928
Unless Madame Chiang Kai-shek
already has a Cenic.

01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:28.609
- What's that?
- A Cenic.

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:32.651
That's the painter that painted
all your early work.

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:41.450
It's Scenic!

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:43.921
That's my nickname in Paris!

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:47.209
All my art school pals
loved my scenic views so much,

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:49.720
they called me... well,
they couldn't pronounce it properly,

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:52.684
so they called me "Cenic."

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:55.724
The more you lie, the smaller you seem.

01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:00.930
How dare you accuse me of lying!
I'm proud of my early Cenics!

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:02.605
Then why did you
paint over the name?

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:05.730
A piece of advice,
never use water-based over an oil.

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:07.450
It'll just fleck right off.

01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:13.242
You sound crazy!
For God's sake, you've seen me paint!

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:16.724
No, I haven't.

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:22.646
I always thought that I had,
but it's like a mirage.

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:26.447
From a distance,
you look like a painter,

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:29.371
but up close there's
just not much there.

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:35.161
I've been to Paris!
I studied at the Beaux-Arts!

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:37.527
At the Grand Chaumiere!

01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:41.162
I spent hours and hours in the Louvre,

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:43.283
staring at the greatness
of the masters!

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:45.090
Walter...

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:49.446
...have you even been to Paris?

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:04.923
I wanted...
I so wanted to become an artist.

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:08.004
It just never turned out so well.

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:22.127
I don't want you
sleeping here any longer.

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:26.444
There are three extra bedrooms
in this house. Go pick one.

01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:49.329
How many more of these
are in the back?

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:52.802
- I don't know. Um, maybe 3,000 or so.
- Does the printer owe us more?

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:55.566
Excuse me, miss.
How much is this painting?

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:59.167
- Go! What do I pay you for?
- Yes, Mr. Keane.

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:00.651
Sorry about that...

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:06.521
It's not even one of mine.
It's one of hers.

01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:18.728
This doesn't change anything.

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:23.888
- I know the truth.
- Who cares?

01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:26.486
Maybe it's time to shake things up.

01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:30.361
- Start putting my name on the MDHs.
- No!

01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:33.922
Absolutely not! I already hate myself
for giving you the waifs.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:37.761
Quiet!
Don't raise your voice!

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:41.970
Oh, I will talk as loud as I want.

01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:45.841
No, you won't!
Or I'll have you whacked!

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:48.561
What?

01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:51.849
If you tell anyone,
I'll have you taken out!

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.244
I know people. Remember Banducci's
cousin? The liquor wholesaler?

01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:00.046
Are you threatening me?

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:02.885
Fine, kill me!

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:05.651
My God, I have kept
our secret for years.

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:07.609
Never once have I...

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:11.249
Do you know how hard
this has been for me?

01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:15.204
I don't have any friends.

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:18.569
I've lied to my own child.

01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:25.965
Life imitating art...
a crying Keane!

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:29.248
Walter, what do you want?

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:34.491
Everything with you is calculated.

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:38.008
We're back where
we had our first date.

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:46.769
Look, I don't deny I need you.
You're the one with the gift.

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:49.331
Now, there's a shot...

01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:53.371
Oh, God, I'm shaking I'm so excited.

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:56.126
The New York World's Fair.

01:05:56.280 --> 01:06:00.763
Seventy million visitors.
Opening day, I unveil my masterpiece!

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:04.601
- What masterpiece?
- Exactly!

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:06.968
What have we
been missing all this time?

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:10.681
Da Vinci has his Mona Lisa,
Renoir has his Boatmen's Lunch.

01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:13.081
Where's my defining statement?

01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:15.248
You sound insane.

01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:18.603
An artist doesn't
just announce his masterpiece.

01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:22.162
Why not? Didn't Michelangelo
know he was hitting a home run

01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:24.368
when he was on his back
painting the Sistine Chapel?

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:26.966
That took him four years.

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:29.566
But here's the best part.

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:31.131
It's for UNICEF.

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:34.771
UNICEF sponsors the Hall of Education.

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:39.369
We can finally give back
to the children of the world.

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:45.360
<i>Hello, everybody.</i>

01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:50.248
<i>I'm Lowell Thomas, standing in front
of what will soon be</i>

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:53.125
<i>one of the wonders of the modern world.</i>

01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:11.530
<i>When people ask me,
"Why did she stay?</i>

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:14.047
<i>Was it fear?
Lack of confidence?"</i>

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:17.284
<i>Margaret was trapped
in a lie that she'd helped create.</i>

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:19.681
<i>And now the cover-up
was worse than the crime.</i>

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:25.926
Why did you have
to promise them Cinerama size?

01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:29.368
Because it has to encompass
all children, all races.

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:33.929
Hundreds of stricken faces,
marching to infinity.

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:36.447
The ultimate Walter Keane.

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:40.321
A publisher says it's good timing
to put out a coffee table book.

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:44.371
You know, classy, Tomorrow's Masters.

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:48.161
They need my early portfolio,
my artistic evolution.

01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:52.041
Yes, where are all
of your preliminary sketches? Hm?

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:54.282
All of that time
that you spent in art school,

01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:57.284
and we seem to have waylaid
all of your youthful experiments.

01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:01.286
All of those unfinished charcoals.
They've gotta be around here somewhere.

01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:07.806
I know you're being sarcastic.
These are good ideas.

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:11.760
Berlin war orphans,
early self-portraits.

01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:14.765
Get outta here.
I'm trying to work.

01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:21.845
Mom! What about dinner?

01:08:23.279 --> 01:08:25.169
Mom, are you home?

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:31.401
Mom?

01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:16.844
Mom.

01:09:20.479 --> 01:09:23.484
Jane, this is Walter's studio!
You need to leave!

01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:25.325
Mom...

01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:28.408
I know.

01:09:29.439 --> 01:09:31.602
No, you don't know anything.

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:34.161
I'm not a child anymore.

01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:37.680
Jane.

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:40.001
Jane!

01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:58.730
Five... six pages?

01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:02.925
Is there something here I'm missing?
He's like the Hula Hoop.

01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:05.811
He just won't go away.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.324
"Will be unveiled in the Grand Pavilion
of the Hall of Education.

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:14.644
Internationally celebrated artist
has been selected.

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:18.247
Will represent the aspirations
of children worldwide."

01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:20.044
This is absurd!

01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:32.043
And who was on
the selection committee?

01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:35.602
Oh, well, there wasn't a committee,
per se.

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:39.441
We just had a luncheon
with me and Ed and Jerome

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:40.886
and Jerome's wife.

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:44.249
Though, technically,
we didn't invite submissions.

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:47.085
Mr. Keane just contacted us directly.

01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:55.048
Come on.

01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:59.762
Wednesday the World's Fair opens,
Thursday our book goes on sale.

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:02.208
Friday I file for divorce.

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:05.483
Oh, why are you always so miserable?

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:12.249
Well, I'm going to enjoy
my afternoon.

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:18.327
Mrs. Teasdale, Walter Keane.

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:23.486
I just wanted to thank you for hosting
this absolutely enchanting soiree.

01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:26.007
Well, you are most welcome.

01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:30.926
Hey, Keane.
Have you seen <i>The Times?</i>

01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:36.120
Honestly, I've been so busy all day
preparing for this lovely occasion.

01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:39.523
I think you should read <i>The Times.</i>

01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:08.327
How could anybody
say something so cruel?

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:12.963
What do you care? It's my name
being dragged through the mud!

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:15.885
- Is he here?
- Uh... yes.

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:19.249
Which is perhaps why it's best
for everybody if you...

01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:25.684
Who wrote this shit!

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:32.406
Mr. Keane, this is not the venue.

01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:35.211
Perhaps you'd like to write a letter
to the editor.

01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:37.362
What are you afraid of!

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:41.445
Just because people like my work,
that means automatically it's bad?

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:44.410
No, but it doesn't
make it art either.

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:46.767
Art should elevate, not pander.

01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:49.042
Particularly in a Hall of Education.

01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:52.488
You have no idea!
Why does someone become a critic?

01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:56.890
- Because he cannot create!
- Oh, dear. That moldy chestnut.

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:58.041
Don't interrupt!

01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:01.647
You don't know what it's like
to put your emotions out there,

01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:04.644
naked for the whole world to see!

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:07.531
What emotions?
It's synthetic hack work.

01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:10.331
Your masterpiece has an infinity
of Keanes,

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:13.290
which makes it an infinity of kitsch.

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:03.130
What is wrong with
the lowest common denominator?

01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:05.485
Huh?

01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:09.171
That's what
this country was built on!

01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:16.162
I'm gonna sue everybody.

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.727
I'm gonna sue everybody.

01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:21.484
Everybody.

01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:29.485
I'm gonna sue this pansy critic.

01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:32.371
And sue the World's Fair.

01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:35.000
And I'm gonna sue UNICEF.

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:43.649
I'm gonna take down UNICEF,

01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:47.646
and all their precious little
boxes of dimes.

01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:50.321
Ah!

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:01.161
But I can't sue you, can I?

01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:07.163
You are the ultimate betrayal.

01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:10.961
You failed me with that painting!

01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:24.169
You crossed over from sentimentality
to kitsch.

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:26.448
Ah! Walter, stop it!

01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:41.525
You like making me look bad?

01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:43.802
You enjoy people laughing at me?

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:48.246
Open up!
Open up!

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:51.210
Just let me in!

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:09.726
I can see you!

01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:24.646
I'm gonna burn you out.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:30.925
You're gonna blow up
like an atom bomb.

01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:39.046
Come on!

01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:46.881
Where are you?

01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:03.770
I am so sorry that I was not
the mother I could have been.

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:07.964
I should have done this years ago.

01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:11.283
Where are we going?
We don't even have any clothes.

01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:14.768
Uh... where we're going,
we don't need much.

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:18.166
Hawaii.

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:22.049
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:24.971
Yes, Hawaii,
because it's paradise there.

01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:28.846
There's... birds and flowers
and beautiful colors,

01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:33.204
and... we're gonna make a new life
for ourselves.

01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:37.524
Okay?
That's my girl.

01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:33.768
- Hello?
- Boy, you were sure hard to track down.

01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:35.365
Thought I might never find you.

01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:38.481
Walter...

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:41.086
I'm a little agitated.

01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:45.285
I got the strangest papers
in the mail today.

01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:49.724
It's a decree of legal separation
and I'd appreciate it if you'd sign it.

01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:53.771
Yeah.
Aren't you acting a little rash?

01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:57.009
Walter, I want a divorce.

01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:59.162
<i>It hurts to hear you
say these words.</i>

01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:01.926
I sure hate that it's come to this.

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:06.449
Well, I suppose I could agree
to a split,

01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:11.686
as long as... as you assign me all the
rights to every painting ever produced.

01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:18.247
- If that's the price.
- Really?

01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:22.448
Okay.

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:25.922
Well, then we have to consider
future revenue streams.

01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:28.686
My God, Walter,
how much more money do you need?

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:31.411
If you want me out of your life,
here's my terms.

01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:36.521
You'll have to paint me 100 more waifs,
100 more Walter Keanes.

01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:42.889
Jane?

01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:46.288
I'm gonna go to the post office.
You wanna come?

01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:48.761
No, I'm gonna go
surf with the gang.

01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:51.048
Jane, I think that your friends
are a little wild.

01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:54.090
Loosen up, Mom.
You're impossible.

01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:57.881
You move me all the way to Hawaii, and
then when I actually make some friends,

01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:00.082
and all you do is complain about them.

01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:02.686
Maybe you need to make some.

01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:06.049
You know that I cannot have people
over to the house.

01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:08.931
That's right, or else they'd see
the precious paintings.

01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:54.488
Hello. We're visiting everyone in this
neighborhood with an important message.

01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:57.644
We have something to share with you
about the wonderful things

01:20:57.800 --> 01:21:00.724
that God's kingdom
will do for mankind.

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:03.451
Well, from where I'm standing,
I don't see much good anywhere.

01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:06.763
Just a lot of pride and thievery
and people treating each other poorly.

01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:09.486
Do you know what it says
in Timothy 3:1-5?

01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:15.287
"In the last clays, critical times
hard to deal with will be here.

01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:18.445
For men will be lovers of themselves."

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:19.801
Sounds like my ex-husband.

01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:31.884
Um... would you like to come in?

01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:41.086
It says right here,
"A worshipper of Jehovah

01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:43.004
must be honest in all things."

01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:47.370
I just can't believe you
let people in the house.

01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:49.888
It also says,

01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:55.171
"No lies speak the truth.
Let the stealer steal no more."

01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:03.967
Shit, this is crazy, man.
All these copies.

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:06.771
- You're like Warhol.
- No.

01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:10.811
Warhol's like me.
That fruit fly stole my act.

01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:13.930
Ah! My art supplies.

01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:19.291
The Factory. I had a factory before
he even knew what a soup can was.

01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:37.520
<i>Oh, yeah.
We got a special guest today.</i>

01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:40.769
<i>A world-famous celebrity.
So let's give a big ”aloha”</i>

01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:42.968
to Margaret Keane.

01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:46.203
So is it true your husband, Walter,

01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:48.761
is the top-selling painter in the world?

01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:54.848
No, Big Lolo.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:58.004
Everything you just said is false.

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:02.647
One, Walter and I are no longer married.

01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:06.407
And two, he...

01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:09.006
...is not a painter.

01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:16.607
But... am I mixed up? Ain't he
the guy who does the crazy eyes?

01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:19.808
No.

01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:23.123
Although he has been taking credit
for it for ten years.

01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:29.522
I am the only painter in the family.

01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:52.727
Whoo!

01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:09.847
You've got to be kidding.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.650
<i>You know what pissed me off?</i>

01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:14.883
<i>Margaret gave the scoop to some
button-pushing Big Lolo.</i> ..

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:16.041
Jesus!

01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:18.680
<i>...instead of a respected
journalist, like myself.</i>

01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:22.003
I knew it.

01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:29.849
Who would want credit?

01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:41.731
Margaret's gone berserk.
You gotta help me.

01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:43.245
I need a story.

01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:46.847
Wire story, national.
Just to calm things down.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:50.163
I don't know, Walter.
What she said is pretty inflammatory.

01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:53.483
But it's nuts!
Doesn't even make sense.

01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:56.405
I mean, I studied art
at the Beaux-Arts in Paris.

01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:59.325
She was still a little kid
in Tennessee.

01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:00.720
Look.

01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:04.729
My early sketchings.

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:10.602
Berlin orphans, 1949.

01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:13.289
Why would Margaret
do something like this?

01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:15.761
She's unhinged.

01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:17.962
She left me to
move into the jungle.

01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:20.691
Fell in with religious zealots!

01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:25.168
Jehovah's Witnesses.

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:28.847
I really don't know all that much
about them.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.526
They don't celebrate Christmas,
can't salute the flag.

01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:34.126
They won't even let Janie go
to the prom!

01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:35.691
Oh...

01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:39.209
He makes me sound crazy.

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:42.609
He said that I copied him,
that he taught me how to paint.

01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:47.129
"She used a slide projector to
trace my work and fill in the colors."

01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:50.762
- Which part of that isn't true?
- All of it.

01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:53.526
I feel good about myself
for the first time in years,

01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:56.490
and I can't let Walter
just take that away from me.

01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:00.446
Hey, is Jehovah okay with suing?

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:08.121
Seventeen million dollars.
The art world is abuzz.

01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:10.851
Today, at federal court, lawyers will
present their opening arguments

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:14.891
in the case of Margaret Keane vs.
Walter Keane and Gannett Newspapers,

01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:18.044
a trial that could produce
the largest libel and slander reward

01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:20.407
- in Hawaiian history.
- Step aside, please.

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:34.686
- Mr. Keane.
- Yes?

01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:36.126
Are you at all concerned
about the charges?

01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:37.805
I'm angry as hell.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.288
But I'm lucky I have the mighty
Gannett News company watching my back.

01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:43.408
I expect this whole trial
dismissed by noon.

01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:47.610
My only concern is that somebody
get this woman some psychiatric help.

01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:49.882
- She needs it.
- All right. Excuse me, gentlemen.

01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:51.280
Excuse me.
Excuse me, please.

01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:58.402
Margaret Keane is a public figure,
and as such, she has to prove

01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:02.531
that our newspapers published statements
aware of probable falsity.

01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:05.411
Now there's no evidence to suggest
that our editors could have known

01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:06.846
these assertions were untrue.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:12.928
We would like to submit 692 articles
and interviews in which Mrs. Keane

01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:17.728
credits Mr. Keane <i>as</i> the painter
of the so-called big-eye children.

01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:30.082
How many years back do these go?

01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:33.210
Mrs. Keane has been making
these statements since 1958.

01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:37.408
This is a very strange case.

01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:41.170
These paintings hang in museums
all over the world,

01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:43.124
attributed to Mr. Keane.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:47.083
And regardless of the truth,
Mrs. Keane has contributed

01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:49.248
immeasurably to the confusion.

01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:52.720
Seems impossible that Gannett's actions

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:55.451
would ever meet the legal standards
for libel.

01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:57.648
So the charge against them is dismissed.

01:27:57.800 --> 01:27:58.961
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.925
- Good luck, Keane.
- Good luck? Where are you going?

01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:10.368
We were charged with libel.
You are charged with slander.

01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:21.802
Mr. Keane?

01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:24.725
You appear to be without counsel.

01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:27.963
Would you like a postponement
in order to get your affairs in order?

01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:31.290
I've always taken care of myself.

01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:34.603
I don't need a bunch of rent-a-suits
to defend my good name.

01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:36.444
Let's proceed.

01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:52.849
<i>I'm concerned about my old pal,
Walter Keane.</i>

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.651
<i>The Hawaiian heat
may have cooked his brain.</i>

01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:58.246
<i>The only thing he knows
about courtrooms and lawyers</i>

01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:01.529
<i>comes from watching Perry Mason
on television.</i>

01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:04.968
I am the sole creator of my art.

01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:08.324
This is my entire life.

01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:10.960
My contribution to the world.

01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:15.125
Mr. Keane, I've told you, you must
ask the witness questions.

01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:18.880
If you're acting as your own attorney,
you cannot make statements at this time.

01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:20.041
Yeah. All right.

01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:24.325
It's hard to keep
all these things straight.

01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:31.290
Mrs. Keane, how do you expect anybody
to swallow your fantastic story?

01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:32.646
Mr. Keane...

01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:43.090
Mrs. Keane, you seem to be a lucid,

01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:46.244
reasonably intelligent woman.

01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:52.169
So how could you possibly have gone
along with a far-out scheme like that?

01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:57.007
I felt forced into it.

01:29:58.320 --> 01:29:59.685
You had me, um...

01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:04.731
He had me dominated.

01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:09.687
He would rant and rave if I didn't
give him what he wanted.

01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:13.965
I was afraid and I didn't see
any option, so I went along.

01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:15.724
May I remind you that you're under oath?

01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:21.524
I just gave in.

01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:24.286
I allowed him

01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:26.767
to take credit for the big eyes.

01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:29.446
They were a reflection of my feelings,

01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:32.723
and it was like losing a child.

01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:34.609
But I was weak.

01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:40.609
I didn't think that I could leave
and support myself and my daughter.

01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:45.846
And he said that nobody would buy
the paintings without his personality.

01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:49.402
Maybe he was right.

01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:54.970
You are... very talented
at being charming.

01:30:56.440 --> 01:31:00.411
And you are a genius
at sales and promotion.

01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:05.686
Hm! It sounds like you've
described two different men.

01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:06.921
Hmm.

01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:09.560
One a sadistic ogre,

01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:13.486
and the other one
a delightful bon vivant.

01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:16.484
Well, that's you, Walter.
You're Jekyll and Hyde.

01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:19.291
That's an outrageous statement!

01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:21.886
- I demand we strike it off the record!
- Overruled!

01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:24.560
No, you were outrageous,

01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:26.961
constantly criticizing me,
wearing me clown,

01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:30.442
saying that you would have me
knocked off if I told the truth.

01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:32.489
- Well, I am telling the truth.
- Your Honor!

01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:36.364
- I ask for mistrial.
- You're a liar!

01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:38.602
You don't even know
what the truth is!

01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:42.850
You don't even know I'm saying the truth
now, and you cannot shut me up!

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:46.971
Hey, hey, hey!
This is not a domestic squabble!

01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:48.360
Or maybe it is.

01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:52.610
But the rest of us have no interest
in watching you two go at it.

01:31:55.800 --> 01:31:58.804
I'm sorry for my emotion.

01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:01.730
I'm an artist.

01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:04.760
Maybe.

01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:09.922
Your Honor, I call as my witness

01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:14.085
Mr. Walter Stanley Keane.

01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:21.804
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:22.961
- and nothing but the truth...
- Yes.

01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:25.441
- ...so help you God?
- Yes.

01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:37.730
Mr. Keane, there seems
to be a lot of innuendo

01:32:37.880 --> 01:32:42.841
and contradictory testimony
about the genesis of the big-eyed waifs.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.607
Would you mind clarifying
to this court

01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:49.650
who spawned these paintings?

01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:56.931
Why, I created these children.

01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:04.090
The choreography is not necessary.
Just sit down and testify.

01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:15.406
I had a wonderful life.

01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:17.403
I was an artist,

01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:20.803
a friend of untold celebrities.

01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:23.930
Yet, when I look back at it all,

01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:26.960
to define what really mattered,

01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:31.802
it was that I was dedicated
to the hungry children of the world.

01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:37.570
It all began in... in Berlin.

01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:39.722
After World War ll.

01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:42.321
The orphans...

01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:44.847
...clutching the barbed wire.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:49.005
Their bodies lacerated.

01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:51.162
Their fingers scrawny,

01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:53.641
their eyes big.

01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:59.842
- Miss Joan Crawford walked up...
- Mr. Keane. Sit down.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.923
Marilyn Monroe...

01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:03.889
Wayne Newton and I...

01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:06.691
Jerry Lewis calls me and says,
"I want you to paint me

01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:08.444
and my family in clown suits."

01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:13.128
Miss Natalie Wood walked up to me
and said,

01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:16.966
"This is the greatest single painting

01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:19.646
I've ever seen in my entire life!"

01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:21.888
- You're done!
- I'm not finished.

01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:23.166
Actually, you are.

01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:26.210
I cannot stomach one more wild tangent
or shaggy dog tale.

01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:28.283
You're not testifying,
you're filibustering.

01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:29.960
Federal courts are overburdened enough

01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:32.128
without all your
docket-clogging nonsense.

01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:35.170
We can stay here
until we grow old and die,

01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:36.960
but it's obvious that
this case boils down

01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:39.481
to your word versus Mrs. Keane's word.

01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:42.803
- Mistrial.
- No, it's not a mistrial!

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:48.528
In my opinion, there's only one way
to clear this thing up.

01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:51.762
You're both going to paint.

01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:58.610
All right, bring those easels down,
set them up on both sides of the bench.

01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:15.205
Now, I'm not looking for a masterpiece.
I don't know much about these things.

01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:19.285
I'm a jurist, not an art critic.
But is one hour enough?

01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:21.130
Yes, Your Honor.

01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:29.243
Okay, then. You've both been provided
with identical supplies.

01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:33.928
So, without any further business,
Mrs. Keane, Mr. Keane, the court is yours.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:42.206
Mr. Keane?

01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:47.010
I'm just setting the mood.

01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:51.444
Waiting for the muse to strike.

01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:55.126
Well, your muse has 58 minutes.

01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:24.845
Ah!

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.128
Mr. Keane? Are you all right?

01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:29.641
Oh, shit.

01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:32.963
My old shoulder injury
just flared up.

01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:35.885
I have, um, um... bad muscles.

01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:40.523
It's... I've been taking medication
for the inflammation.

01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:42.845
So...

01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:58.928
I don't think I'll
be able to paint today.

01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:19.971
The jury found in favor
of Margaret Keane on all points.

01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:23.209
She won on charges of defamation,
emotional distress,

01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:25.010
and damaged reputation.

01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:27.049
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations, Margaret!

01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:30.841
- Thank you, thank you very much.
- Congratulations!

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:32.960
Margaret, what are you going
to call the painting?

01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:37.849
Uh... Exhibit 224.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:42.049
Margaret, can I possibly
have your autograph?

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:47.050
<i>Two things mattered to Margaret:
her daughter and her paintings.</i>

01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:49.931
<i>And after all the crazy turns
the story took,</i>

01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:53.004
<i>she came out at the end
with both of them.</i>

01:38:54.305 --> 01:39:00.534
