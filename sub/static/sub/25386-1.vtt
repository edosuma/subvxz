Hey.

01:16.409 --> 01:19.621
If you're trying to smuggle
another kid in without paying,
that's frowned upon,

01:19.621 --> 01:22.248
especially since this suitcase
has no airholes.

01:23.249 --> 01:25.210
No, those are my trophies.

to camp,

rebuild our cabins.

she would be that cheap?

How do you know
she's not coming back?

04:27.350 --> 04:30.311

05:23.948 --> 05:26.576
On the bright side,
we can use the splinters

05:26.576 --> 05:27.869

Oh, look, I know
we're all really sad,

05:37.336 --> 05:39.464
but we have a busload
of bummed-out campers.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.632

05:49.724 --> 05:51.559
Oh, that is too bad,

05:51.559 --> 05:54.228

joining Lou in her ugly cry.

05:56.314 --> 05:57.899
It's not ugly.

to drive back, so we're
stuck here for tonight.

Let's just try to make
the best of it,

06:12.914 --> 06:16.834
Agreed. I shall go into
the kitchen to prepare
a tasty snack.

06:16.834 --> 06:19.253
What food could still be
good after nine months?

06:19.253 --> 06:23.174
Otter Nuggets. The expiration
date on those things is,
"You should live so long."

06:25.384 --> 06:28.346
Look! They're all dead.

06:29.138 --> 06:32.809

his father was

06:39.982 --> 06:42.193

06:43.611 --> 06:45.113
I'm gonna go help Ravi.

06:48.241 --> 06:52.286
I just can't believe we won't
be spending the summer
at Camp Kikiwaka.

06:52.870 --> 06:57.792
I mean, this is where
I learned to swim
and ride a bike.

06:58.209 --> 07:00.253
And tie my shoes.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.213
You first came to camp
when you were eight.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.423
Don't judge me.

07:05.258 --> 07:08.302
We were a clog-wearing family.

07:09.428 --> 07:10.596
Lou, I know it's hard...

07:10.596 --> 07:14.225
Right? I mean,
I make the bunny ears,

07:14.225 --> 07:17.395
but then, is it over?
Is it under?

07:17.937 --> 07:19.230
Is it through?

07:21.274 --> 07:24.652
I meant, I was really looking
forward to the summer, too.

07:24.652 --> 07:26.737
I was going
to be a counselor.

07:26.737 --> 07:29.740
And you were
finally going to teach me
the secret Kikiwaka handshake

07:29.740 --> 07:31.534
invented by
Jedediah Swearengen.

07:31.951 --> 07:34.495
Oh, right. Here it is.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.001
That's it?

07:40.460 --> 07:43.629
The man had a hook.
What did you expect?

07:48.259 --> 07:51.095
So, unfortunately,
tomorrow everyone
has to go home.

07:51.095 --> 07:52.597
ALL: Aw!

07:52.597 --> 07:53.598
Yay!

07:55.308 --> 07:57.810
But we're going to make
tonight the most fun
night ever. Right, Lou?

07:58.227 --> 08:00.605
(SOBS) That's right.
So much fun.

08:03.483 --> 08:07.528
This is awesome!
And since the cabins
are literally toast,

08:07.528 --> 08:08.696
we get to sleep outside.

08:09.155 --> 08:11.657
Outside? Like animals?

08:12.283 --> 08:13.409
Is that safe?

08:13.409 --> 08:16.787

08:16.787 --> 08:18.498
What is wrong with you?

08:18.956 --> 08:21.709
Well, according to
my teachers, I...

08:22.251 --> 08:23.920
The less we know,
the better.

08:25.338 --> 08:29.258
I know this place looks like
a mess, but Camp Kikiwaka
can be beautiful.

08:29.550 --> 08:30.676
So beautiful.

08:32.553 --> 08:35.431

glints off the dead
fish-bellies in the lake.

08:36.724 --> 08:38.351
Things don't last long
in our lake.

08:38.351 --> 08:41.437
We once saw an entire beaver
dissolve in 10 minutes.

08:42.605 --> 08:45.441
They really should have
mentioned that
in the brochure.

08:47.485 --> 08:49.403
Look!

08:49.403 --> 08:52.532
More dark fur! Whatever
wrecked this place was also
apparently manscaping.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.744
And used our door
as a scratching post.

08:59.580 --> 09:02.083
Do you think
whatever it was is gone?

09:02.416 --> 09:04.252
Uh, yes, of course.

09:04.252 --> 09:07.255
After all, there's nothing
left to eat in here.

09:52.341 --> 09:54.427
Okay, everybody,
we can all relax.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.804
Because it turns out,
it was just a baby bear.

09:57.430 --> 10:01.601
Good thing I went back
to assess the danger, or we
would not have known that.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.603
You went back
because you dropped me.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.563
The important thing is,
we're all safe.

10:06.564 --> 10:09.483
Unless there are
any puppies or kittens

wanna warn us about.

is a flea-covered nuisance.

Hey, that's what my mom calls
my Uncle Pooter.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.704
Hey, you leave my dad
out of this.

10:25.166 --> 10:28.085

Why do you need
that window open?

10:28.669 --> 10:31.589

that overpowering
stench of bear?

10:31.839 --> 10:34.967
Oh. I thought that was Finn.

10:36.093 --> 10:39.597
I give up. We've got
stuck windows, broken benches.

10:40.139 --> 10:42.183
This place is never gonna
be in shape for dinner.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.560
Not necessarily.

A pageant girl
is always prepared.

10:47.730 --> 10:49.315
What do you mean?

10:49.732 --> 10:52.151
We can fix this bench
with double-sided tape,

10:52.735 --> 10:55.696
which I normally use
to keep from getting
a swimsuit wedgie.

10:56.906 --> 10:59.033
Wow. This tape is strong.

10:59.867 --> 11:02.119
That must really hurt
when you rip it off your butt.

11:03.329 --> 11:06.540
I'll say. Once, I did
a pageant in Georgia,

11:06.540 --> 11:08.501
and they heard me screaming
in Tennessee.

11:09.877 --> 11:14.632
So, the bear ate everything
in the freezer except
these Otter Nuggets.

11:14.632 --> 11:16.550
That bear has good
survival instincts.

11:17.176 --> 11:20.471
Yeah, it left these,
but ate the fridge magnets.

11:20.471 --> 11:22.598
The ones
with inspirational sayings?

11:22.890 --> 11:23.974
Yep.

11:23.974 --> 11:25.726
"While beggars
cannot be choosers,"

11:25.726 --> 11:27.603
to quote my favorite magnet.

11:28.687 --> 11:33.567
Perhaps I can improve these
Otter Nuggets with some of
this spilled paprika!

11:35.653 --> 11:37.655
Those are fire ants.

11:37.655 --> 11:40.741

may not have our own cabin,

but, I give you
Woodchuck tent.

11:52.586 --> 11:54.004

11:54.463 --> 11:58.300
Just leave the flap open.
Those Otter Nuggets
aren't sitting too well.

12:02.096 --> 12:05.641
Why is the girls' tent
so much bigger than ours?
Yeah!

12:05.641 --> 12:08.477
It is called
chivalry, gentlemen.

12:09.103 --> 12:11.605
Plus, the big one
was too heavy
for me to carry.

12:16.110 --> 12:18.696
(CHUCKLES) Destiny,
we're only here for one night.

12:18.696 --> 12:21.157
Did you really need to unpack
all of your trophies?

12:21.157 --> 12:25.119
Yes. Basking in the glow
of my past victories
helps me sleep.

12:25.536 --> 12:27.913
Now, if you'll excuse me...

12:29.582 --> 12:31.542
I always tap dance
before bed.

12:41.010 --> 12:44.722
under no circumstances
will there be tap dancing
of any sort.

13:16.462 --> 13:19.757

with wings, fangs, scales
or udders.

13:20.716 --> 13:21.800
Udders?

13:21.800 --> 13:23.594

13:23.844 --> 13:27.223

right after "squirrels

to a sleepover.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.245
That is a shock.

13:50.162 --> 13:52.706
I mean, Finn, that was mean!

13:56.835 --> 13:58.170
Okay, time to go home.

I've never done?

Used a hygiene product?
Chewed with your mouth closed?

with a bear. BRB.

he's talking like that.

Yes!

was a scarecrow.

come back?

making friends.

close acquaintances

over the winter,
but then did not.

Because they
"lost your e-mail."

that's not really
