WEBVTT

00:02.377 --> 00:03.754
(June) BACK IN INDIANA,

00:03.796 --> 00:05.464
THE BATHROOM

00:03.796 --> 00:05.464
WAS ALWAYS A PRIVATE PLACE.

00:05.506 --> 00:06.882
BUT NOW THAT

00:05.506 --> 00:06.882
I LIVE IN NEW YORK,

00:06.924 --> 00:08.258
LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE,

00:06.924 --> 00:08.258
IT'S CROWDED.

00:08.300 --> 00:09.510
(door opens)

00:09.551 --> 00:11.052
WHAT'S FINGER-LICKIN',

00:09.551 --> 00:11.052
CHICKEN?

00:11.094 --> 00:12.847
NOTHIN' MUCH,  BUTT.

00:12.888 --> 00:14.431
THAT RHYMED MORE

00:12.888 --> 00:14.431
IN MY HEAD.

00:14.473 --> 00:15.557
BUT I'M OKAY WITH IT.

00:15.599 --> 00:17.058
THE BATHROOM'S ACTUALLY

00:15.599 --> 00:17.058
BECOME A PLACE

00:17.100 --> 00:18.686
WHERE CHLOE AND I

00:18.727 --> 00:21.647
I'M JUST ABOUT

00:18.727 --> 00:21.647

00:21.689 --> 00:23.064
WANT ME TO DO YOU FIRST?

00:23.106 --> 00:24.065
NO, THANKS.

00:24.107 --> 00:25.108

00:25.150 --> 00:27.319
IT'S 2013.

00:25.150 --> 00:27.319
LOWER THE DECK.

00:27.361 --> 00:30.071

00:30.113 --> 00:32.240

00:42.501 --> 00:44.920
BENJAMIN'S BACK FROM

00:42.501 --> 00:44.920
HIS DIRECTING GIG IN L.A.

00:44.962 --> 00:47.715
HE MADE JOSEPH GORDON-LEVITT

00:44.962 --> 00:47.715
KISS MELISSA McCARTHY

00:47.756 --> 00:49.090
IN A MOVIE I'M REALLY

00:47.756 --> 00:49.090
LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING

00:49.132 --> 00:50.091
CALLED "AGNES."

00:50.133 --> 00:51.760
SOUNDS GREAT.

00:51.802 --> 00:54.179
YEAH. NOW HE'S DIRECTING JAMES

00:51.802 --> 00:54.179
IN SOME BIG NEW COMMERCIAL

00:54.221 --> 00:56.015
BEFORE HE GOES TO AUSTRALIA.

00:56.056 --> 00:58.017
YOU KNOW, THIS IS

00:56.056 --> 00:58.017
GONNA BE THE LONGEST

00:56.056 --> 00:58.017
AMOUNT OF TIME

00:58.058 --> 00:59.810
WE'VE ACTUALLY

00:58.058 --> 00:59.810
EVER SPENT TOGETHER.

00:59.852 --> 01:01.353
OOH! THAT'S EXCITING!

01:01.395 --> 01:04.105
YEAH. I BUMPED HIM UP TO

01:01.395 --> 01:04.105
NUMBER ONE ON MY GUY ROTATION.

01:04.147 --> 01:06.107
NUMBERS TWO THROUGH SIX

01:04.147 --> 01:06.107
ARE JUST GONNA HAVE TO WAIT

01:06.149 --> 01:08.109
WHILE HE PUTS

01:06.149 --> 01:08.109
HIS DINGO IN MY BABY.

01:08.151 --> 01:11.739
CHLOE, DID YOU TELL BENJAMIN

01:08.151 --> 01:11.739
ABOUT YOUR ROTATION?

01:11.780 --> 01:13.114
NO. WHY?

01:13.156 --> 01:15.617
UH, BECAUSE THAT'S NOT JUST

01:13.156 --> 01:15.617
SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE HAS.

01:15.659 --> 01:17.285
WELL, EVERYONE SHOULD.

01:15.659 --> 01:17.285
IT'S AWESOME.

01:17.327 --> 01:18.328
IT'S THE PERFECT SITUATION.

01:18.370 --> 01:20.163
NOBODY LOSES.

01:18.370 --> 01:20.163
EVERYBODY WINS.

01:20.205 --> 01:23.124
NO, ONE PERSON LOSES--

01:20.205 --> 01:23.124
THE PERSON WHO THINKS

01:23.166 --> 01:24.418
THAT THEY'RE DATING

01:23.166 --> 01:24.418
SOMEONE EXCLUSIVELY

01:24.459 --> 01:26.127
AND THEN FINDS OUT

01:24.459 --> 01:26.127
THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

01:26.169 --> 01:29.757
LIKE ME IN SEVENTH GRADE WHEN

01:26.169 --> 01:29.757
I WAS DATING AARON DeMAYO.

01:29.798 --> 01:32.175
HE WAS A WRESTLER,

01:29.798 --> 01:32.175
AND I WAS A MAT MAID--

01:32.217 --> 01:34.135
WHICH PEOPLE DON'T THINK

01:32.217 --> 01:34.135
IS A REAL CHEERLEADER

01:34.177 --> 01:36.137
BECAUSE WE

01:34.177 --> 01:36.137
DIDN'T HAVE UNIFORMS,

01:36.179 --> 01:39.140
WE JUST WORE WHATEVER SHADE OF

01:36.179 --> 01:39.140
PURPLE WE HAD IN OUR CLOSET.

01:39.182 --> 01:41.769
ANYWAY, I WAS HEARTBROKEN

01:39.182 --> 01:41.769
WHEN I FOUND OUT

01:41.810 --> 01:47.441
THAT AARON WAS  ALSO  SEEING

01:41.810 --> 01:47.441
THERESA FISHER.

01:47.482 --> 01:49.735
UGH. IS TELLING BENJAMIN

01:47.482 --> 01:49.735
ABOUT MY GUY ROTATION

01:49.777 --> 01:52.613
THE ONLY WAY I'M GONNA GET YOU

01:49.777 --> 01:52.613
TO STOP WITH THE JIBBER-JABBER?

01:52.654 --> 01:53.739
IT IS.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.449
FINE. BUT SO HELP ME GOD,

01:55.490 --> 01:58.159
IF I HEAR ONE JIBBER

01:55.490 --> 01:58.159
OR EVEN A PIECE OF JABBER,

01:58.201 --> 01:59.620
I WILL FORCIBLY WAX YOU.

02:03.248 --> 02:06.167
SWEET BATHROOM. WHAT'S THIS

02:03.248 --> 02:06.167
COMMERCIAL FOR, ANYWAY?

02:03.248 --> 02:06.167

02:06.209 --> 02:08.670
TOWELS? SOAP? SHOWER HEADS?

02:08.712 --> 02:09.588
SUNGLASSES.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.172
AWESOME. I'M WATCHING.

02:11.214 --> 02:12.340
AH, YOU WON'T BE ABLE

02:11.214 --> 02:12.340
TO WATCH, ACTUALLY.

02:12.382 --> 02:13.174
IT'S ONLY GONNA AIR IN JAPAN.

02:13.216 --> 02:14.175
JAMES IS HUGE THERE

02:14.217 --> 02:16.177
EVER SINCE THREE GIRLS

02:14.217 --> 02:16.177
DRESSED AS HELLO KITTY

02:16.219 --> 02:17.262
WERE TRAMPLED TO DEATH

02:17.304 --> 02:19.974
AT THE "VARSITY BLUES" PREMIERE

02:17.304 --> 02:19.974
IN KYOTO.

02:20.015 --> 02:21.016
(sighs)

02:24.311 --> 02:25.646
HEY.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.064
HEY YOURSELF.

02:27.106 --> 02:28.107
I'M DATING FIVE OTHER GUYS.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.191
I'VE GOT SIX GUYS

02:28.148 --> 02:30.191

02:30.233 --> 02:32.193
YOU'RE KIDDING.

02:32.235 --> 02:33.695
I'M DATING

02:32.235 --> 02:33.695
FIVE OTHER GIRLS,

02:33.737 --> 02:35.196
EXCEPT WE CALL IT

02:33.737 --> 02:35.196
A "CYCLE."

02:35.238 --> 02:36.490
OH, MY GOD.

02:35.238 --> 02:36.490
THAT IS SO FUNNY.

02:36.531 --> 02:38.075
AUSTRALIANS HAVE

02:36.531 --> 02:38.075
DIFFERENT WORDS FOR EVERYTHING.

02:38.117 --> 02:40.201
WE DO.

02:38.117 --> 02:40.201
ISN'T DATING

02:38.117 --> 02:40.201
SIX PEOPLE THE BEST?

02:40.243 --> 02:41.369
BECAUSE FIVE

02:40.243 --> 02:41.369
IS UNSATISFYING...

02:41.411 --> 02:43.204
AND SEVEN ALLOWS

02:41.411 --> 02:43.204
NO TIME TO RECOUP.

02:43.246 --> 02:45.707
I JUST REMEMBERED

02:43.246 --> 02:45.707
WHY I LIKE YOU.

02:45.749 --> 02:47.126
YOU ARE SO...

02:45.749 --> 02:47.126
HOT?

02:47.167 --> 02:48.710
I WAS GONNA SAY "SLUTTY."

02:50.295 --> 02:52.213
LOVE THE FIRST DAY

02:50.295 --> 02:52.213

03:03.266 --> 03:05.226
TO SHOW HOW ACCESSIBLE I AM,

03:05.268 --> 03:08.313
THEN SIT BACK

03:05.268 --> 03:08.313
AND BASK IN THEIR ADMIRATION.

03:08.355 --> 03:11.441
IT'S MY FUEL.

03:08.355 --> 03:11.441
KEEPS ME RUNNING.

03:11.483 --> 03:14.444
EVERY DAY, I LEARN FROM YOU.

03:21.952 --> 03:24.245

03:24.287 --> 03:27.541

03:41.304 --> 03:42.263
WHEN YOU'RE NAKED.

03:42.305 --> 03:44.307
AND WHERE ARE YOU MOST NAKED?

03:44.349 --> 03:46.267

11:13.672 --> 11:14.715
OW!

11:14.757 --> 11:16.717
THAT'S JUST ME BEING

11:14.757 --> 11:16.717
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE TRUTH.

11:16.759 --> 11:18.719
(exhales) THANK YOU, JUNE.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.641
HOW LONG HAVE THOSE

11:20.013 --> 11:22.641
BEEN IN?

11:22.681 --> 11:23.766
AN HOUR.

11:23.808 --> 11:25.268
TAKE 'EM OUT.

11:29.606 --> 11:32.733
BENJAMIN LOVETT?

11:32.775 --> 11:34.569
WE'RE WITH

11:32.775 --> 11:34.569
U.S. IMMIGRATION SERVICES.

11:34.611 --> 11:35.778
WE NEED TO SEE

11:34.611 --> 11:35.778
YOUR WORK VISA.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.947
UH, YEAH.

11:39.782 --> 11:41.576
I'M SURE YOU'LL FIND

11:39.782 --> 11:41.576
EVERYTHING'S CURRENT

11:41.618 --> 11:42.827
AND UP TO DATE.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.954
YEP, SURE IS.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.954
GREAT.

11:44.996 --> 11:46.331
BUT YOU'RE STILL

11:44.996 --> 11:46.331
GETTING DEPORTED.

11:46.373 --> 11:49.167
(chuckles) WHAT IS THIS,

11:46.373 --> 11:49.167
SOME KIND OF JOKE?

11:49.209 --> 11:51.169
NO, SIR.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.169
THIS COMES FROM THE VERY TOP.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.795
WE'RE GONNA NEED YOU

11:51.211 --> 11:52.795
ON A PLANE BACK TO AUSTRALIA.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.922
WH--HEY,

11:52.837 --> 11:54.922
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

11:54.964 --> 11:57.467
WH-WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?

11:57.509 --> 11:59.760
(cell phone rings)

11:59.802 --> 12:01.221
(beep)

11:59.802 --> 12:01.221
HELLO.

12:01.262 --> 12:02.222
IT'S DONE.

12:02.263 --> 12:04.683
THANKS, JULIUS.

12:02.263 --> 12:04.683
I OWE YOU ONE.

12:04.723 --> 12:05.808
SO CAN I TAKE YOU

12:04.723 --> 12:05.808
ON MY BROTHER'S HOUSEBOAT

12:05.850 --> 12:07.477
LIKE YOU PROMISED?

12:07.519 --> 12:08.769
IS THERE ANY WAY

12:08.811 --> 12:10.938
BENJAMIN'S DEPORTATION

12:08.811 --> 12:10.938
CAN BE UNDONE?

12:10.980 --> 12:12.773
NOPE. IT'S ALREADY

12:10.980 --> 12:12.773
BEEN PROCESSED.

12:12.815 --> 12:13.816
THEN, NO.

12:13.858 --> 12:15.235
(beep)

12:15.276 --> 12:16.444
(door slams)

12:21.408 --> 12:22.701
CHLOE.

12:22.741 --> 12:23.826
HEY, DID YOU SEE THAT GUY

12:22.741 --> 12:23.826
I WAS WITH?

12:23.868 --> 12:25.870
HE'S SOMETHING CALLED

12:23.868 --> 12:25.870
AN INSURANCE ADJUSTER.

12:25.912 --> 12:27.455
SO HOT.

12:27.497 --> 12:29.790
I'M THINKING ABOUT GIVING HIM

12:27.497 --> 12:29.790
A SPOT IN MY ROTATION.

12:29.832 --> 12:30.791
WHAT ABOUT BEN?

12:30.833 --> 12:32.793
HE HAS CALLED THE APARTMENT

12:30.833 --> 12:32.793
A THOUSAND TIMES.

12:32.835 --> 12:34.795
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO

12:32.835 --> 12:34.795
TELL HIM HOW YOU FELT,

12:34.837 --> 12:35.796
NOT GET HIM DEPORTED.

12:35.838 --> 12:37.215
WELL, I THOUGHT ABOUT IT

12:37.257 --> 12:39.467
AND I REALIZED I FELT

12:37.257 --> 12:39.467
LIKE GETTING HIM DEPORTED.

12:39.509 --> 12:40.843
OH, GOSH. YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:39.509 --> 12:40.843
I AM DONE.

12:40.885 --> 12:43.513
I AM NOT GONNA GIVE YOU

12:40.885 --> 12:43.513
ANY MORE RELATIONSHIP ADVICE.

12:43.555 --> 12:44.805
OKAY.

12:44.847 --> 12:46.099
BUT THE LAST THING

12:44.847 --> 12:46.099
THAT I'LL SAY

12:46.140 --> 12:47.642
IS JUST BECAUSE

12:46.140 --> 12:47.642
YOU GOT BEN DEPORTED

12:47.684 --> 12:48.851
DOESN'T MEAN

12:47.684 --> 12:48.851
THAT YOU'LL BE OVER HIM.

12:48.893 --> 12:52.439
HE'S STILL GOING TO BE

12:48.893 --> 12:52.439
IN HERE AND IN HERE.

12:52.480 --> 12:55.316
THE ONLY PLACE THAT

12:52.480 --> 12:55.316
A GUY SHOULD BE IS HERE.

12:55.358 --> 12:56.484
JUNE, I'M NOT LIKE YOU.

12:56.526 --> 12:57.736
I DON'T GET TWISTED UP

12:56.526 --> 12:57.736
OVER GUYS.

12:57.776 --> 13:00.029
I HAVE GREAT EXPERIENCES

12:57.776 --> 13:00.029
AND I MOVE ON.

13:00.071 --> 13:01.822
I DON'T GET TWISTED UP

13:00.071 --> 13:01.822
OVER GUYS EITHER.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.824
I JUST KNOW YOU CAN'T DO

13:01.864 --> 13:03.824
SOMETHING SO SELFISH

13:03.866 --> 13:05.826
THAT IT AFFECTS SOMEONE

13:03.866 --> 13:05.826
FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIFE.

13:05.868 --> 13:07.995
I COULD'VE DONE THAT, TOO.

13:08.037 --> 13:09.997
AFTER AARON BROKE UP WITH ME,

13:10.039 --> 13:12.208
I WAS MOVING ON

13:10.039 --> 13:12.208
WITH MY OWN LIFE...

13:10.039 --> 13:12.208
(spritzes)

13:12.250 --> 13:13.710
WHEN I DISCOVERED

13:13.752 --> 13:15.836
THAT THERESA FISHER

13:15.878 --> 13:17.922
WAS A SMOKER.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.922
(liquid splashes)

13:17.964 --> 13:20.091
I COULD'VE BUSTED HER

13:17.964 --> 13:20.091
AND GOTTEN HER EXPELLED

13:20.133 --> 13:23.094
AND HAD AARON ALL TO MYSELF,

13:20.133 --> 13:23.094
BUT I CHOSE NOT TO,

13:23.136 --> 13:26.055
BECAUSE YOU DON'T MESS

13:23.136 --> 13:26.055
WITH PEOPLE LIKE THAT.

13:26.097 --> 13:27.848
BUT WHAT IF I HAD MADE

13:26.097 --> 13:27.848
A DIFFERENT CHOICE?

13:27.890 --> 13:29.850
MAYBE AARON AND I

13:27.890 --> 13:29.850
WOULD'VE KEPT DATING.

13:29.892 --> 13:32.729
MAYBE WE'D STILL BE TOGETHER.

13:29.892 --> 13:32.729
WHO KNOWS?

13:32.771 --> 13:35.856
THAT'S WHY YOU KEEP

13:32.771 --> 13:35.856
TALKING ABOUT THIS GUY.

13:35.898 --> 13:38.777
BECAUSE YOU THINK

13:35.898 --> 13:38.777
HE'S THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY.

13:38.817 --> 13:40.069
WHAT?

13:38.817 --> 13:40.069
NO, I DON'T THINK THAT.

13:40.111 --> 13:41.321
IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW.

13:41.362 --> 13:42.739
THAT'S WHY

13:41.362 --> 13:42.739
YOU'RE STILL OBSESSED

13:42.781 --> 13:45.116
WITH SOME GUY WHO DUMPED YOU

13:42.781 --> 13:45.116
A MILLION YEARS AGO.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.701
JUNE, I MADE OUT

13:45.158 --> 13:46.701
WITH TWO GIRLS

13:46.743 --> 13:48.286
WHILE YOU WERE TELLING ME

13:46.743 --> 13:48.286
THAT STUPID STORY.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.246
YOU NEED TO MOVE ON

13:48.328 --> 13:50.246
WITH YOUR LIFE.

13:50.288 --> 13:52.540
(clank)

13:50.288 --> 13:52.540
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:52.582 --> 13:53.874
HELPING YOU.

13:53.916 --> 13:54.875
ALSO HELPING YOU.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.127
IF YOU'RE GONNA GRAB MY BOOB,

13:54.917 --> 13:56.127
JUST GRAB IT.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.878
BUT DON'T TEASE ME.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.798
♪ I DON'T CARE ♪

13:59.838 --> 14:00.965

14:02.717 --> 14:04.511
GREAT DAY, ISN'T IT?

14:04.552 --> 14:06.554
BEN'S BEEN DEPORTED.

14:06.596 --> 14:08.389
THE CREW IS IN A PANIC.

14:08.431 --> 14:11.601
WHAT THEY NEED RIGHT NOW

14:08.431 --> 14:11.601
IS A LEADER, A ROCK.

14:11.643 --> 14:12.935
AND YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS?

14:12.977 --> 14:14.145
ME?

14:14.187 --> 14:15.896
(chuckles)

14:14.187 --> 14:15.896

14:23.946 --> 14:25.906
ALL RIGHT. LISTEN, EVERYONE.

14:25.948 --> 14:28.993
UH, I KNOW IT'S A SHAME

14:25.948 --> 14:28.993
ABOUT BEN BEING DEPORTED,

14:31.996 --> 14:33.914
I'M NOT GOING TO ABANDON YOU.

14:33.956 --> 14:36.209
MY AGENT TALKED TO

14:33.956 --> 14:36.209
THE PRODUCTION COMPANY

14:36.250 --> 14:38.169
AND CONVINCED THEM THAT WE'VE

14:36.250 --> 14:38.169
ALREADY SHOT ENOUGH FOOTAGE

14:38.211 --> 14:39.920
TO CUT TOGETHER

14:38.211 --> 14:39.920
A GREAT COMMERCIAL.

14:39.962 --> 14:42.131
SO ARTISTICALLY,

14:39.962 --> 14:42.131
YOU GUYS DON'T NEED TO WORRY.

14:42.173 --> 14:44.551
YOUR WORK WILL BE SEEN.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.927
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO SHOOT

14:44.592 --> 14:46.927
FOR ANOTHER WEEK.

14:46.969 --> 14:48.304
WILL WE STILL GET PAID?

14:48.346 --> 14:50.640
I DON'T SEE HOW.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.184
ANYWAY, ISN'T THIS AWESOME?

14:53.226 --> 14:55.645
I GOT US THE REST OF THE WEEK

14:53.226 --> 14:55.645
OFF! (laughs)

14:55.687 --> 14:58.022
WHO'S UP FOR SUSHI

14:55.687 --> 14:58.022
AND A MATINEE?

14:58.064 --> 15:00.107

15:01.984 --> 15:03.944

15:01.984 --> 15:03.944
THIS IS WHERE MEN GO.

15:03.986 --> 15:05.780
I DID NOT GET

15:03.986 --> 15:05.780
MY PILOT LOVER DEREK

15:05.822 --> 15:07.741
TO GET US ON

15:05.822 --> 15:07.741
A LAST-MINUTE FLIGHT TO INDIANA

15:07.782 --> 15:08.825
TO COME TO

15:07.782 --> 15:08.825
A LOBSTER BARREL BATHROOM

15:08.867 --> 15:10.744
AND NOT CONFRONT AARON DeMAYO.

15:10.785 --> 15:12.537
AARON DeMAYO!

15:12.579 --> 15:14.997
(toilet flushes)

15:12.579 --> 15:14.997
GET OUT HERE!

15:15.039 --> 15:16.875
(gasps) JUNE.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.960
IF THIS IS HIM,

15:16.916 --> 15:19.960
I GET IT AND I AM IN.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.962
(flushes)

15:22.004 --> 15:24.591
JUNE?

15:22.004 --> 15:24.591
HEY, AARON!

15:24.632 --> 15:27.134
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

15:27.176 --> 15:28.803
JUNE STILL HAS YOUR

15:27.176 --> 15:28.803
OLD PHONE NUMBER MEMORIZED.

15:28.845 --> 15:30.179
AND YOUR MOM SAID

15:28.845 --> 15:30.179
YOU'D BE HERE.

15:30.221 --> 15:32.973
NOW JUNE IS GONNA

15:30.221 --> 15:32.973
SCREW IT OUT WITH YOU

15:33.015 --> 15:34.183
SO SHE REALIZES THAT YOU'RE

15:33.015 --> 15:34.183
NOT THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY

15:34.225 --> 15:35.976
AND FINALLY MOVES ON.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.896
NO! NO, I-I-I DON'T WANT

15:36.018 --> 15:37.896
TO SCREW.

15:37.937 --> 15:38.979
I'M HERE BECAUSE

15:39.021 --> 15:41.232
MY CRAZY ROOMMATE IS TRYING

15:39.021 --> 15:41.232
TO PROVE A POINT.

15:41.274 --> 15:44.026
SHE THINKS THAT YOU AND I HAVE

15:41.274 --> 15:44.026
"UNFINISHED BUSINESS."

15:44.068 --> 15:45.779
SHE'S GOING THROUGH A THING

15:44.068 --> 15:45.779
WITH A GUY,

15:45.820 --> 15:47.154
AND I'M TRYING TO TELL HER

15:47.196 --> 15:49.783
THAT SHE CAN'T DO

15:47.196 --> 15:49.783
WHATEVER SHE WANTS TO PEOPLE.

15:49.824 --> 15:51.992
LIKE, WHEN I BUSTED

15:49.824 --> 15:51.992
THERESA FISHER FOR SMOKING

15:52.034 --> 15:54.995
AND I COULD'VE GOTTEN HER

15:52.034 --> 15:54.995
EXPELLED BUT I CHOSE NOT TO.

15:55.037 --> 15:57.998
OH, MY GOD. I TOTALLY FORGOT

15:55.037 --> 15:57.998
THAT THERESA USED TO SMOKE.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.000
(laughs)

15:58.040 --> 16:00.000
I'M SURPRISED A.J. WAS

16:00.042 --> 16:01.628
BORN WITH ALL HIS FINGERS

16:00.042 --> 16:01.628
AND TOES.

16:01.669 --> 16:03.296
(laughs) WAIT. WHO'S A.J.?

16:03.337 --> 16:05.005
OH, SORRY. A.J.'s OUR SON.

16:05.047 --> 16:08.008
WAIT.

16:05.047 --> 16:08.008
YOU AND THERESA ARE MARRIED?

16:08.050 --> 16:10.094
AARON, WHAT IS TAKING YOU

16:08.050 --> 16:10.094
SO LONG?

16:10.136 --> 16:11.888
A.J.'s INSISTING ON GOING

16:10.136 --> 16:11.888
IN THE MEN'S ROOM,

16:11.930 --> 16:13.013
BUT YOU NEVER CAME BACK

16:11.930 --> 16:13.013
TO THE TABLE,

16:13.055 --> 16:15.850
AND NOW I'VE LEFT THE TWINS

16:13.055 --> 16:15.850
ALONE WITH THEIR MAC AND CHEESE.

16:15.892 --> 16:19.061
GOD, THIS IS SO REAL.

16:15.892 --> 16:19.061
HEARTLAND.

16:19.103 --> 16:22.231
HEY, THERESA. HI, I'M JUNE.

16:19.103 --> 16:22.231
WE WENT TO SCHOOL TOGETHER.

16:22.273 --> 16:24.317
YEAH, IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

16:22.273 --> 16:24.317
AARON, CAN YA TAKE A.J.?

16:24.358 --> 16:26.110
HE KEEPS SAYING

16:24.358 --> 16:26.110
HE'S GONNA EXPLODE.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.862
KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE

16:26.152 --> 16:27.862
OF SOMETHING HERE.

16:27.904 --> 16:29.029
OH. OKAY.

16:29.071 --> 16:31.198
NO, I'LL DO IT.

16:29.071 --> 16:31.198
THAT'S FINE.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.033
BUT I AM GOING TO CABO

16:31.240 --> 16:33.033
AT THE END OF THE MONTH

16:33.075 --> 16:35.912
WITH MY SISTER,

16:33.075 --> 16:35.912
AND I'M DRINKING TEQUILA.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.708
THERE'S A LITTLE BOY IN THERE,

16:38.080 --> 16:40.708
AND THAT WEIRDS ME OUT.

16:40.750 --> 16:45.045
AARON, I-I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU

16:40.750 --> 16:45.045
AND THERESA ENDED UP TOGETHER.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.768

17:40.810 --> 17:44.104
IF I MISLED YOU IN SOME WAY,

17:46.148 --> 17:49.360

17:49.402 --> 17:52.154

17:52.196 --> 17:53.531

18:00.162 --> 18:02.122

18:02.164 --> 18:03.750

18:03.791 --> 18:05.543
SO WE DECIDED TO HAVE SEX IN

18:03.791 --> 18:05.543

18:11.382 --> 18:12.383
SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED

18:11.382 --> 18:12.383
A MILLION YEARS AGO?

18:12.425 --> 18:13.634
THAT WAS YESTERDAY.

18:13.676 --> 18:15.386

19:19.325 --> 19:21.452
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS.

19:21.494 --> 19:24.122
