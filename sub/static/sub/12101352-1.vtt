WEBVTT

01:09.895 --> 01:11.071
Stop!

01:46.323 --> 01:48.151
Run!

01:48.195 --> 01:49.587
Grow up, El.

01:49.631 --> 01:51.285
Yeah, those are
house property.

01:52.851 --> 01:55.158
Hey, beautiful.
- Hey, slow down.

01:55.202 --> 01:58.161
-Aah!
-Hey, Beau, Beau. Put me down.

01:58.205 --> 02:00.598
I'’m just giving the pledge
a head start.

02:02.731 --> 02:03.949
Don'’t you dare.

02:05.429 --> 02:07.605
-Hey. Don'’t look at her.

02:07.649 --> 02:09.346
-Do not look at her.
-Bro...

02:09.390 --> 02:12.262
You have to earn the right
to look at a Kap--

02:12.306 --> 02:15.439
-Sucker!
- Did I hear you laugh?

02:15.483 --> 02:17.702
That profile picture
isn'’t even you, honey.

02:17.746 --> 02:19.617
Bye!

02:19.661 --> 02:21.489
Bye!
-Where'’s Kylie? Where's Kylie?

02:23.273 --> 02:26.320
If you get me wet,
I will murder you.

02:26.363 --> 02:27.756
-Hey, sorry, sis.
-No!

02:27.799 --> 02:29.584
-

02:29.627 --> 02:31.151
-Come here.
-No, no, no!

02:34.241 --> 02:35.416
Whoo!

02:35.459 --> 02:37.374
We got five kegs.

02:37.418 --> 02:39.246
Ten handles.

02:39.289 --> 02:41.204
Sorry for
the interruption, Dylan.

02:41.248 --> 02:43.206
We have a little
disciplining to do.

02:44.816 --> 02:47.167
We got to make an example out
of you, Alvin.

02:47.210 --> 02:50.648
Now, your pussy long face.
Keep that on.

02:50.692 --> 02:53.173
Boys, it'’s real simple.

02:53.216 --> 02:54.696
Don'’t talk back
to your brothers.

02:54.739 --> 02:56.132
Back to business.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.395
Guys, in true Sig Nu Pi
tradition...

03:03.400 --> 03:05.097
Top comment.

03:05.141 --> 03:07.230
You guys got to know
which girls are sluts.

03:10.015 --> 03:11.365
An exclamation point?

03:11.408 --> 03:12.714
Yes, an exclamation point,
Alvin.

03:12.757 --> 03:14.194
Two holes are better
than one.

03:14.237 --> 03:15.586
They'’re better shaven.

03:15.630 --> 03:17.936
Guys, two in the pink,
one in the stink.

03:17.980 --> 03:20.243
It'’s a stupid game.
We said we'’d knock it off.

03:20.287 --> 03:23.290
Wes, you should know,
no one likes sloppy seconds.

03:23.333 --> 03:26.293
Tag the ho'’s
to protect the bros.

03:26.336 --> 03:28.773
Let'’s fucking drink.

03:28.817 --> 03:30.340
Sig Nu Pi!

03:30.384 --> 03:32.908
Sig Nu Pi! Sig Nu Pi!

03:32.951 --> 03:35.389
Sig Nu Pi! Sig Nu Pi!

03:35.432 --> 03:37.695
Sig Nu Pi!
Sig Nu Pi!

03:37.739 --> 03:39.784
K-A-P-P-A.

03:39.828 --> 03:41.830
Boop-boop-bee-doo!

03:41.873 --> 03:43.397
I'’d like everyone
to take a moment

03:43.440 --> 03:45.790
and find your big or little.

03:45.834 --> 03:47.227
I see you, girl.

03:47.270 --> 03:48.880
Okay, you two are buddies
for the night.

03:48.924 --> 03:50.534
Yes, check in with them.

03:50.578 --> 03:52.275
Are they having a good time?
Do they need water?

03:52.319 --> 03:54.016
Is their ass hanging out from
their shorts

03:54.059 --> 03:55.931
while they make out with a rando
against the wall?

03:55.974 --> 03:57.280
Maybe you should
walk them home.

03:57.324 --> 03:58.716
-Yes.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.065
Just don'’t leave
the house tonight

04:00.109 --> 04:01.502
without checking in
with your buddy.

04:01.545 --> 04:04.418
-Cool?
- Cool.

04:04.461 --> 04:06.289
And we love you all.

04:06.333 --> 04:10.337
And happy first homecoming
to our Kappa newbies!

04:12.426 --> 04:13.818
To honor.

04:13.862 --> 04:15.255
To honor.

04:15.298 --> 04:17.300
If you can'’t cum in her,

04:17.344 --> 04:19.302
cum on her!

04:29.312 --> 04:31.488
All the tops

04:31.532 --> 04:33.708
All the cops

04:33.751 --> 04:35.666
'’Cause I'm fucking up

04:37.668 --> 04:39.583
I bang on like a funk

04:44.588 --> 04:46.938
Um, serving redneck realness?

04:46.982 --> 04:48.679
White trash,
not redneck.

04:48.723 --> 04:52.117
Got to raise the stakes, baby.
Beers are for bitches.

04:52.161 --> 04:55.338
Not the pank drank!

04:55.382 --> 04:57.384
Oh, no, what is that?

04:57.427 --> 04:59.647
It'’s cheap vodka
and artificial sweeteners.

04:59.690 --> 05:01.213
A shit combo,
but a minimal hangover.

05:01.257 --> 05:02.389
Yum!

05:03.607 --> 05:05.696
And it tastes like
a fucking dumpster.

05:05.740 --> 05:07.481
-My girl'’s got such
a refined taste.

05:07.524 --> 05:09.570
Hmm. Hey, are you sure
that I can stay

05:09.613 --> 05:11.398
with you and Ellery
tonight?

05:11.441 --> 05:13.574
Of course, but the hangover
really isn'’t that bad.

05:13.617 --> 05:15.489
Oh, no, no.
My dad'’s just being so extra.

05:15.532 --> 05:16.881
-I can'’t wait to move out.
-

05:16.925 --> 05:19.275
-Winter quarter, honey.
-Ooh!

05:19.319 --> 05:20.798
Okay, bae,
I got to focus.

05:20.842 --> 05:22.539
-Yeah.
-Okay, fine. I'’m going anyway.

05:22.583 --> 05:23.801
-Bye!
-Let'’s get it.

05:23.845 --> 05:25.150
-Hey.
- Rules are,

05:25.194 --> 05:26.891
if you'’re playing this game,

05:26.935 --> 05:30.460
everyone drinks the pank drank.

05:30.504 --> 05:32.375
Not the pank drank!

05:32.419 --> 05:33.637
Hey, she'’s getting it.

05:33.681 --> 05:35.726
Hey, elbows.

05:35.770 --> 05:37.249
All right.

05:37.293 --> 05:38.425
You got it.
You got it.

05:39.948 --> 05:42.385
-Oh!
- Boys flick. Girls blow.

05:43.647 --> 05:45.519
Hmm. You want to play
that game.

05:45.562 --> 05:46.955
Give it a shot.

05:51.655 --> 05:53.265
Mm!

05:53.309 --> 05:55.267
-Like a champ.
-

05:55.311 --> 05:57.357
Yeah, that tastes so gross.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.749
What the hell is that?

05:58.793 --> 06:00.360
Yeah, like a dumpster.

06:00.403 --> 06:03.232
Okay, this one or this one?

06:03.275 --> 06:05.016
-Um...
-This is what I want.

06:05.060 --> 06:07.758
No. You'’d better pray
Dad doesn'’t see that photo.

06:07.802 --> 06:09.238
-Are you serious?
-Whatever.

06:09.281 --> 06:11.545
He doesn'’t even look
at my stuff anyways.

06:11.588 --> 06:14.025
But I'’m in the picture.
He always gives me shit
for stuff like that.

06:16.027 --> 06:18.029
It'’s just weed,
and I'’m the one smoking it,

06:18.073 --> 06:20.380
so I think it'’s okay.

06:20.423 --> 06:22.425
You know, you went off
on your little internship,

06:22.469 --> 06:24.427
and you came back
a total druggie.

06:26.037 --> 06:28.518
-I'’m not smoking crack, Wes.
-Not yet.

06:28.562 --> 06:30.085
You are so full of shit.

06:30.128 --> 06:32.566
-Oh, my God.

06:32.609 --> 06:34.132
-Here, come on.
-Okay, fine.

06:34.176 --> 06:35.873
-Give it to me for a sec.
-You just-- Exactly.

06:35.917 --> 06:37.440
Just use it.

06:37.484 --> 06:39.834
See, this one is just
so much better.

06:39.877 --> 06:42.314
And look, no weed.

06:42.358 --> 06:43.707
All right,
that was my second choice.

06:43.751 --> 06:44.969
All right.

06:46.057 --> 06:47.581
Okay.

06:47.624 --> 06:49.191
-Don'’t need to see that.
-

06:49.234 --> 06:51.846
It'’s just this girl I'm texting,
you know.

06:51.889 --> 06:53.717
Mm-hmm. Cool.

06:55.893 --> 06:59.680
Wes, I actually have a really
important question to ask you.

06:59.723 --> 07:01.029
Okay, one sec.

07:07.731 --> 07:09.733
What is it?

07:09.777 --> 07:12.301
Come on, what'’s up?

07:12.344 --> 07:14.564
Hey, you good?

07:14.608 --> 07:16.566
What should my caption be?

07:18.089 --> 07:19.656
It'’s really fucking
stressing me out.

07:21.484 --> 07:23.181
I-I don'’t know.

07:23.225 --> 07:24.618
Um...

07:25.706 --> 07:27.490
Crack is wack.

07:27.534 --> 07:29.318
-You'’re such a--
-Crack is wack.

07:29.361 --> 07:31.233
-Dad would so appreciate that.
-You'’re such a shit.

07:31.276 --> 07:32.930
I like that.
That'’s really good.

07:32.974 --> 07:34.541
-Okay, I'’m going to post it.
-You know what?

07:34.584 --> 07:36.281
I'’m going to go get one.
Do you want anything?

07:36.325 --> 07:37.457
-Mm-mm.
-All right.

07:39.633 --> 07:41.765
Dad'’s totally going
to call your phone.

07:43.332 --> 07:46.248
Okay I'’m posting it.
Get ready.

07:46.291 --> 07:47.989
-Excuse me!

07:50.208 --> 07:51.949
Yo, Kai-kai.

07:51.993 --> 07:53.603
Hello, ladies.

07:55.953 --> 07:58.478
-You little...
-Oh, I have to pee.

07:58.521 --> 08:00.654
Hey, use the--
Use the upstairs bathroom.

08:00.697 --> 08:02.090
-Oh.
-Sig royalty only.

08:02.133 --> 08:03.526
I'’m royalty?

08:03.570 --> 08:05.441
-I expect that back.

08:06.573 --> 08:07.748
Hi, babe!

08:07.791 --> 08:09.532
Hey. Oh, yep,
she'’s done.

08:09.576 --> 08:11.273
I'’m ready to go.

08:11.316 --> 08:13.188
I think I'’m to start
checking in with everyone.

08:13.231 --> 08:16.539
Okay, yeah.
We, cannot have any transports.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.106
Mm-hmm. Preach.

08:18.149 --> 08:19.716
I'’m going to do
a once around,

08:19.760 --> 08:21.501
and we can start taking girls
home if we need to.

08:21.544 --> 08:23.851
I love you. You got that?

08:23.894 --> 08:25.461
I got it. Always got it.

08:25.505 --> 08:26.767
Oh, you going this way.

08:28.725 --> 08:30.858
All right, I know y'’all
are going to keep partying,

08:30.901 --> 08:34.252
but, yup, I got lab
in the morning.

08:34.296 --> 08:35.732
Eff my life.

08:35.776 --> 08:37.081
Okay, hey...

08:37.125 --> 08:38.605
Come on, bud.

08:38.648 --> 08:40.171
You guys have
a good time tonight?

08:42.130 --> 08:43.305
You'’re good, dude.

08:45.612 --> 08:49.398
Party people, thank you so much.

08:49.441 --> 08:51.356
Good? Okay, cool.

08:59.364 --> 09:01.541
Yo, yo, yo,
let'’s bounce.

09:01.584 --> 09:02.759
I'’ll walk you home.

09:02.803 --> 09:04.195
Great. Um...

09:04.239 --> 09:05.414
Ready?

09:07.808 --> 09:09.505
I forgot to check in
with Kylie.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.594
-One sec.
-We will wait.

09:13.509 --> 09:14.641
Okay.

09:16.425 --> 09:17.557
Kylie!

09:22.605 --> 09:23.780
'’Sup?

09:23.824 --> 09:25.608
What'’s up?

09:25.652 --> 09:27.654
-Whoa, okay.
-What'’s the password?

09:27.697 --> 09:29.786
Password is move, Dylan.

09:29.830 --> 09:31.483
Okay, but no.

09:31.527 --> 09:33.268
Dylan, I'’m tired.
Is Kylie in there?

09:33.311 --> 09:34.965
-Ellery, I don'’t know what--
-

09:35.009 --> 09:36.793
Kylie! Let'’s go, babe.
I'’m tired.

09:38.708 --> 09:40.449
-Hey.
-'’Sup. Is Kylie in here?

09:40.492 --> 09:42.756
-Come on in.
-Dude, why didn'’t you call me

09:42.799 --> 09:44.758
if she was passed out?

09:46.281 --> 09:48.675
Ugh. That'’s so bright.

09:48.718 --> 09:50.198
Thanks for coming out.

09:50.241 --> 09:52.374
She took one hit
and was passed the fuck out.

09:52.417 --> 09:54.637
-I can see that.
-Yo, you done with this?

09:54.681 --> 09:56.944
-Yeah, yeah. Thanks, bro.
-Yeah. You'’re welcome.

09:56.987 --> 09:58.467
Girl.

09:58.510 --> 10:00.425
Why was the door locked?

10:00.469 --> 10:02.471
I didn'’t know it was.

10:02.514 --> 10:03.777
Ugh. Wes?

10:05.300 --> 10:07.302
I-- I didn'’t lock anything.

10:07.345 --> 10:08.825
-Let'’s sit up.
-

10:08.869 --> 10:10.697
Okay, can you put your feet down
on the ground?

10:10.740 --> 10:12.307
We'’re going to get up and go.

10:13.787 --> 10:15.658
Okay, can you put
your feet down?

10:15.702 --> 10:17.442
Hey, hey. You good, bro?

10:17.486 --> 10:18.618
Yeah. Yeah, man.

10:19.923 --> 10:21.272
I'’m going to get
your shoes--

10:21.316 --> 10:22.970
No, no. I got it.
I got it. I got it.

10:23.013 --> 10:24.754
Here, let me--
Let me call y'’all a ride.

10:24.798 --> 10:26.016
No, no. It'’s fine.

10:26.060 --> 10:27.757
Are you okay?

10:27.801 --> 10:29.977
I just don'’t know why
you got her so fucked up.

10:30.020 --> 10:31.979
-El, she'’s fine.
- No, she'’s not.

10:32.022 --> 10:33.676
Just stand up girl, okay?

10:33.720 --> 10:35.373
Wes? Wes?

10:35.417 --> 10:37.462
Wes, don'’t forget your phone,
bro.

10:37.506 --> 10:38.855
Thanks.

10:38.899 --> 10:41.553
We'’re going to walk. Ready?

10:41.597 --> 10:42.816
Here we go.

10:42.859 --> 10:44.644
Yo, Wes.

10:44.687 --> 10:45.819
Wes?

10:47.690 --> 10:49.649
I got it. Yeah, I got you.

10:49.692 --> 10:51.738
Thanks for coming, bro.
I think she'’s gone.

10:51.781 --> 10:53.391
Is she okay?

10:53.435 --> 10:54.654
Let'’s just go.

10:56.177 --> 10:57.831
Where does she live?

10:57.874 --> 11:00.137
She'’s crashing
at our place tonight.

11:00.181 --> 11:01.486
Have a good night y'’all.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.668
-

12:52.902 --> 12:54.164
What'’s wrong?

12:54.208 --> 12:55.905
Have you talked
to Kylie yet?

12:55.949 --> 12:57.907
You mean this morning?

12:57.951 --> 12:59.387
Yeah.

12:59.430 --> 13:00.736
No.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.825
She just came in the kitchen

13:02.869 --> 13:04.784
and told me she thinks
something happened to her

13:04.827 --> 13:06.742
in Beau'’s room last night.

13:08.352 --> 13:11.660
It sounded a lot
like last year.

13:13.357 --> 13:14.532
That girl.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.102
She-- Did she, like...

13:19.146 --> 13:21.452
s-say who?

13:22.976 --> 13:24.542
She doesn'’t remember.

13:27.763 --> 13:29.199
What are you going to do?

13:34.117 --> 13:35.858
-

13:39.209 --> 13:40.602
I'’m betting in my jeans

13:40.645 --> 13:41.995
Hey, girl.

13:44.475 --> 13:46.042
Alvin, keep that
chicken head on.

13:59.882 --> 14:01.449
Hey. Hey, what'’s up?

14:01.492 --> 14:04.017
I messaged you.

14:04.060 --> 14:05.714
Yeah, I'’m sorry.

14:05.757 --> 14:07.107
Uh, can we chat?

14:07.150 --> 14:09.152
Um, yeah. I got to go
in a sec, though.

14:09.196 --> 14:11.328
-That'’s cool.
-All right.

14:11.372 --> 14:13.417
Hey, man, can we have the room
for a couple of minutes?

14:13.461 --> 14:15.506
Is that cool?
All right, thanks.

14:17.726 --> 14:19.554
-You want any coffee?
-Nah.

14:23.253 --> 14:25.038
So, about your message.

14:25.081 --> 14:26.735
I just want to let you know
that everything

14:26.778 --> 14:27.997
has been taken care of.

14:28.041 --> 14:30.130
What does that mean?

14:30.173 --> 14:32.175
Beau was fucking with me.

14:33.437 --> 14:35.962
Okay, but I told your frat

14:36.005 --> 14:37.920
not to post that shit
with Kappas.

14:37.964 --> 14:39.617
-Yeah, I know.
-And I was in the photo too,

14:39.661 --> 14:41.010
so that'’s fucking gross, Wes.

14:41.054 --> 14:42.446
Okay, okay, well, I deleted it,

14:42.490 --> 14:44.448
so I don'’t know what to say.

14:44.492 --> 14:46.624
Why don'’t you go talk to Beau.
He was the one who posted it.

14:46.668 --> 14:47.930
-Mm-hmm.
-Seriously.

14:50.237 --> 14:51.934
So, wait, what were y'’all
doing in there?

14:51.978 --> 14:54.154
You were just hanging out?

14:54.197 --> 14:55.938
When?

14:55.982 --> 14:57.940
Mm, after the party?

14:57.984 --> 14:59.724
-3:00 a.m.
-After the party?

14:59.768 --> 15:01.857
I don'’t know.
I was in bed by 2:30.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.773
No, Wes, you were in his room.

15:06.035 --> 15:07.558
Actually, I was in here.

15:07.602 --> 15:08.951
Asleep.

15:08.995 --> 15:11.475
No, you were in Beau'’s room,

15:11.519 --> 15:12.955
and you were super drunk,

15:12.999 --> 15:14.174
and I texted you afterwards,

15:14.217 --> 15:15.871
so you can check it.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.742
Okay. Whatever.

15:19.483 --> 15:21.268
Hello?

15:21.311 --> 15:23.096
Give me my phone.
I'’m gonna be late to practice.

15:23.139 --> 15:25.533
Are you going to talk to me
about this?

15:25.576 --> 15:28.275
Okay, just give me
my phone, please.

15:28.318 --> 15:30.668
Why are you being
so insane right now?

15:30.712 --> 15:32.844
I fucking knew you were
blacked out last night.

15:32.888 --> 15:34.803
-I wasn'’t blacked out.
-Oh, really?

15:34.846 --> 15:37.632
You clearly don'’t remember being
physically present in a room.

15:37.675 --> 15:39.677
-So, what does that constitute?
-Okay, you know what?

15:39.721 --> 15:41.462
I can let go and have a good
time just like you.

15:41.505 --> 15:42.898
Okay, but I don'’t black out,

15:42.942 --> 15:44.334
and maybe if you would
get off your phone

15:44.378 --> 15:45.683
for, like, five minutes--

15:45.727 --> 15:47.294
Oh, my God,
you sound just like Mom.

15:47.337 --> 15:49.035
Why are you being such
a fucking asshole right now?

15:49.078 --> 15:50.819
Wow.

15:50.862 --> 15:52.560
Wow. You know, I have somewhere
to fucking be, okay?

15:52.603 --> 15:53.953
Okay, okay.

15:55.563 --> 15:56.999
What the fuck?

16:05.051 --> 16:07.053
I could go with you
to file a report.

16:07.096 --> 16:10.534
Okay, realistically,
what am I going to say?

16:10.578 --> 16:13.015
"Hi, I think I was assaulted,

16:13.059 --> 16:14.974
but I was too drunk
to really remember."

16:15.017 --> 16:16.758
Yes.

16:16.801 --> 16:19.239
No, that sounds so stupid.

16:19.282 --> 16:22.285
They can'’t do anything about it
unless you do.

16:23.895 --> 16:26.376
I know, I just-- I really--
I don'’t know what to do, okay?

16:27.856 --> 16:29.379
I'’m just walking you
through options.

16:29.423 --> 16:30.859
You know you don'’t have
to do anything.

16:33.296 --> 16:37.431
Are you sure you don'’t remember
anything else?

16:38.562 --> 16:40.782
Hey.

16:43.611 --> 16:46.353
Um, I had to tell Ellery
this morning.

16:46.396 --> 16:48.050
It'’s kind of protocol.

16:48.094 --> 16:50.966
But I promise you,
I didn'’t tell anyone else.

16:51.010 --> 16:54.578
It'’s fine. We don't even really
need to talk about it anymore.

16:54.622 --> 16:57.842
We can talk about it
however long you need to.

16:57.886 --> 16:59.540
Yeah, girl,
if you need anything...

17:01.498 --> 17:03.152
I'’m so sorry.

17:03.196 --> 17:04.414
Malik has the worst timing.

17:04.458 --> 17:06.068
Just, uh, give me one sec.

17:08.331 --> 17:09.593
Hey, babe.

17:16.774 --> 17:18.820
God, it'’s hot in here, right?

17:18.863 --> 17:20.039
A little.

17:30.527 --> 17:32.138
My dad'’s going to kill me.

17:32.181 --> 17:33.530
What?

17:34.662 --> 17:36.272
No, he'’s not.

17:37.708 --> 17:39.101
Sorry, babes.

17:39.145 --> 17:41.799
Yeah, I got to get home.

17:41.843 --> 17:43.845
Oh, um, okay.

17:45.281 --> 17:47.109
-Just text us.
- Yeah.

17:54.029 --> 17:56.162
What did Beau say?

17:57.902 --> 17:59.208
I didn'’t talk to Beau.

18:01.167 --> 18:03.125
I talked to Wes.

18:03.169 --> 18:06.998
Kappa should be prepared
if this gets out.

18:07.042 --> 18:08.696
Yeah, got it.

18:08.739 --> 18:11.829
I can ask Malik if he hears
anything from the guys

18:11.873 --> 18:13.875
-or at practice...
-No, no, no.

18:13.918 --> 18:16.225
Let'’s just wait,
see what she does.

18:16.269 --> 18:19.054
Are you sure? Because Malik
wouldn'’t tell people--

18:19.098 --> 18:20.969
Yeah, Shayleen,
I'’m sure, okay?

18:24.190 --> 18:26.235
All right, um...

18:26.279 --> 18:30.109
well, have fun
at work or whatever.

19:18.331 --> 19:20.071
-Ahem, I noticed you were, uh,

19:20.115 --> 19:22.161
looking up graduate programs
earlier.

19:22.204 --> 19:24.163
What schools
are you looking at?

19:24.206 --> 19:26.034
Um, I'’m just looking,

19:26.077 --> 19:27.992
because I'’m going to work
at a lab first.

19:28.036 --> 19:29.733
Oh, I see. Yeah, okay.

19:29.777 --> 19:31.822
Well, if you need a rec
or anything...

19:31.866 --> 19:33.128
Oh, thanks, Tyler.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.869
Um, cool.

19:36.262 --> 19:37.785
It'’s, uh, getting dark.

19:37.828 --> 19:40.309
Do you want me to walk you home
or anything?

19:40.353 --> 19:42.093
-Sorry, what?
- Oh! I--

19:42.137 --> 19:44.531
It'’s getting dark, do you want
me to walk you home?

19:44.574 --> 19:47.098
-Oh, no, I'’m good. Thank you.
-Are you sure?

19:47.142 --> 19:50.493
-I live right behind Greek Row.
-Awesome, but I'’m good.

19:50.537 --> 19:52.452
Thank you, though.

19:52.495 --> 19:54.149
-Get home safe.
-Yeah.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.933
Yeah, okay.
- Have a good night.

19:55.977 --> 19:57.152
Okay.

19:58.327 --> 20:00.242
Hey, have a good night.

20:27.748 --> 20:29.097
Come on, let'’s go!

20:29.140 --> 20:31.142
Solid leg, Moore.

20:31.186 --> 20:32.666
Let'’s go, Scott.
Go, go, go!

20:34.058 --> 20:36.191
Dig, dig, dig!

20:36.235 --> 20:37.584
Let'’s go, Scott.
Come on, come on.

20:37.627 --> 20:40.021
Let'’s go.
Come on, dig, dig!

20:40.064 --> 20:41.588
Dig, dig. Come on.

20:41.631 --> 20:43.459
Let'’s go. Let's go, Scott.

20:43.503 --> 20:45.418
Come on, dig, dig.
Come on.

20:47.333 --> 20:49.726
You just cost your team
a three-second lead.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.427
Get out.

20:54.470 --> 20:55.950
Get on the deck.

20:55.993 --> 20:57.560
Let'’s go, come on.

20:57.604 --> 20:59.562
On the deck.

20:59.606 --> 21:01.172
All right, give me 50.
Everybody.

21:05.873 --> 21:08.223
On the deck.
Let'’s go, let's move.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.616
You want to join us, Scott?

21:13.750 --> 21:15.709
When one of you fail,
all of you fail.

21:17.363 --> 21:19.321
When one of your teammates
fucks up,

21:19.365 --> 21:21.584
it'’s your job to get him
to pull his head out of his ass

21:21.628 --> 21:23.586
and get it together.

21:26.241 --> 21:28.243
Because there is no
second place, Scott.

21:33.335 --> 21:35.163
You finish up.

21:38.906 --> 21:41.082
-Shower! Change!

22:11.199 --> 22:12.461
What'’s going on?

22:14.071 --> 22:15.421
You got something
on your mind?

22:17.248 --> 22:20.077
Nah, I'’m just a little tired
right now, I think.

22:20.121 --> 22:21.949
I'’ll be ready for next week,
though.

22:21.992 --> 22:24.343
Well, may I remind you
that we do not rise

22:24.386 --> 22:26.301
to our level of ambition.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.825
We sink to the level
of our training.

22:28.869 --> 22:31.524
Did you get that
out of your playbook?

22:31.567 --> 22:33.526
Look at me in the fucking eyes
when I'’m talking to you.

22:36.746 --> 22:38.531
This is about Olympic
qualifying.

22:38.574 --> 22:40.359
This is the year.

22:40.402 --> 22:41.751
Got it.

22:41.795 --> 22:43.884
Yeah.

22:43.927 --> 22:46.495
I don'’t want to see your face
on my pool deck ever again,

22:46.539 --> 22:48.584
with a performance
like that.

22:48.628 --> 22:50.064
Do you understand that?

22:53.589 --> 22:55.156
Don'’t forget that.

22:57.724 --> 22:59.073
Fucking punk!

23:14.958 --> 23:16.133
Hey, Wes.

23:17.308 --> 23:18.527
Wes.

23:19.746 --> 23:20.921
Yo.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.359
Just get some rest tonight.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.492
You'’ll show up tomorrow.
You always do. Don'’t question.

23:26.535 --> 23:28.319
Thanks, man.

23:28.363 --> 23:31.453
I just need a break from, like,
everything right now.

23:31.497 --> 23:33.020
What'’s going on?

23:34.413 --> 23:36.023
I'’m just tired.

23:36.066 --> 23:38.417
Yeah? Well, um,
maybe you should cool down

23:38.460 --> 23:39.853
on all the partying
you'’ve been doing.

23:41.463 --> 23:42.769
What?

23:42.812 --> 23:44.771
Look, I'’m not trying
to start shit,

23:44.814 --> 23:46.816
but, bro, you were wasted
on Saturday.

23:49.645 --> 23:51.386
But you'’re not trying
to start shit?

23:51.430 --> 23:52.779
Okay, whatever, man.

23:52.822 --> 23:54.824
Wes, Wes, no, no, no.
Not whatever.

23:54.868 --> 23:56.565
Look, bro,
your head isn'’t in it,

23:56.609 --> 23:58.698
and you'’re dragging the rest
of the fellas down with you.

23:58.741 --> 24:00.439
I had an off day.

24:00.482 --> 24:01.657
It happens.

24:01.701 --> 24:03.485
Wes, it'’s not about that.

24:03.529 --> 24:05.618
You'’re acting like
this isn'’t important anymore.

24:05.661 --> 24:07.707
If it'’s not,
you should just quit.

24:09.404 --> 24:11.493
You know, I could.

24:11.537 --> 24:14.191
But I don'’t think you'd be fast
enough to step up and anchor.

24:17.368 --> 24:18.805
Yeah, fuck you, Wes.

24:20.241 --> 24:21.416
Fuck you.

24:28.641 --> 24:30.207
That'’s not perfect, of course.

24:30.251 --> 24:32.296
Because when I take the slope
of that one,

24:32.340 --> 24:36.475
this factor, this power,
this exponent,

24:36.518 --> 24:39.869
"N plus N" will come down.

24:39.913 --> 24:43.569
Just as N came down here,
N plus 1 will come down.

24:43.612 --> 24:47.268
And therefore,
I'’d better divide by N plus 1,

24:47.311 --> 24:49.531
so that when I do
take the slope

24:49.575 --> 24:51.577
and when I do go
to number two--

24:51.620 --> 24:53.056
Hey, Kylie, do you smoke?

24:53.100 --> 24:54.667
I'’ll take a hit.

24:54.710 --> 24:56.320
Want to see
the presidential suite?

24:56.364 --> 24:57.670
There'’s a mesmerizing light

24:57.713 --> 25:00.324
that'’s, like, so calming.

25:00.368 --> 25:01.717
I want to see.

25:01.761 --> 25:04.851
Come here, sit closer.

25:04.894 --> 25:06.548
Come on, take a hit.

25:08.463 --> 25:10.552
Thanks.

25:15.644 --> 25:18.560
Just relax. It'’s okay.

25:18.604 --> 25:20.780
-You'’re okay, Kylie.
- What?

25:20.823 --> 25:22.912
She'’s such a slut.
- I was sending a text.

25:22.956 --> 25:25.306
She'’s such a slut. Heard she slept with Wes Scott.

25:28.178 --> 25:30.180
Did you see the post?

25:30.224 --> 25:32.008
She got tagged. Look at her.

25:33.140 --> 25:35.011
Just relax.

25:46.588 --> 25:49.156
She'’s such a slut. Heard she slept with Wes Scott.

25:49.199 --> 25:51.375
Did you see that?
The photo on her profile.

25:51.419 --> 25:52.638
She got tagged.

25:52.681 --> 25:54.335
Oh, my God.

25:54.378 --> 25:55.554
She'’s such a slut.

25:57.643 --> 25:59.775
Another is sines and cosines,

25:59.819 --> 26:01.777
if you can fit it in to that.

26:01.821 --> 26:03.649
Another is out of the X or...

26:18.838 --> 26:20.927
Your brother
is so famous.

26:24.452 --> 26:25.584
Eh.

26:27.324 --> 26:28.630
The world stage.

26:29.718 --> 26:31.546
That is huge.

26:32.678 --> 26:33.809
He'’s killing it.

26:35.811 --> 26:38.292
Uh, what are you working on?

26:38.335 --> 26:39.859
Just logging a few orders.

26:40.947 --> 26:42.426
Neato.

26:46.953 --> 26:50.478
Well, um, I am headed home.

26:52.523 --> 26:54.308
Uh, cool.

26:54.351 --> 26:56.179
I'’m going to finish this up,
and then I'’ll head on.

26:57.528 --> 26:58.704
Oh.

26:58.747 --> 27:01.620
Um...okay.

27:11.717 --> 27:15.677
When you log your hours,
uh, there'’s no overtime.

27:15.721 --> 27:17.461
We don'’t have
the budget for it.

27:17.505 --> 27:19.159
I would prefer
if you just came in--

27:19.202 --> 27:21.248
Tyler, I know there'’s no
overtime.

27:21.291 --> 27:23.729
I will totally clock out.

27:25.774 --> 27:27.080
Okay.

27:27.123 --> 27:28.516
Okay.

27:31.998 --> 27:33.869
Are you sequencing
something?

27:33.913 --> 27:35.392
Yes.

27:35.436 --> 27:37.612
A few requests that came in
this afternoon.

27:39.396 --> 27:40.789
From whom?

27:40.833 --> 27:42.922
Um...

27:42.965 --> 27:45.707
I don'’t remember,
but I could check for you.

27:45.751 --> 27:47.448
No, no, no.
It'’s, uh...

27:49.015 --> 27:50.843
It'’s cool.

27:50.886 --> 27:52.235
-You sure?
-Yeah, yeah.

27:53.454 --> 27:54.673
Just...

27:54.716 --> 27:56.065
just hurry up.

27:56.109 --> 27:58.372
Turn off the lights
when you leave.

27:58.415 --> 27:59.634
You got it.

28:01.680 --> 28:02.855
Good night.

28:52.382 --> 28:55.255
Check out this last photo.
It'’s on fire.

28:56.343 --> 28:57.518
Yo, bro.

28:59.912 --> 29:01.478
Yo. Bro.

29:04.568 --> 29:06.396
Hey, '’sup?

29:06.440 --> 29:08.529
Monday Funday.
I texted you.

29:08.572 --> 29:10.183
Yeah, have fun.

29:11.488 --> 29:13.273
Bro, everyone does
Monday Funday.

29:13.316 --> 29:14.622
Not tonight.

29:15.841 --> 29:17.233
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

29:22.151 --> 29:23.805
I don'’t know, man.

29:23.849 --> 29:25.764
You tell me.

29:39.299 --> 29:40.517
'’Sup?

29:40.561 --> 29:42.041
Hey! What'’s up?

29:42.084 --> 29:43.694
I texted you.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.959
Yeah. I just...

29:47.002 --> 29:48.743
had my phone off all day,
you know?

29:48.787 --> 29:50.571
Why?

29:50.614 --> 29:53.008
Trying to find some
peace of mind from you fuckers.

29:54.880 --> 29:57.752
Oh, my God,
you'’re ridiculous.

30:01.277 --> 30:02.757
You rolling with us?

30:02.801 --> 30:04.803
Nah, I'’m going
to stay in tonight.

30:04.846 --> 30:06.065
You cool?

30:06.108 --> 30:08.110
Yeah, just tired.

30:08.154 --> 30:09.764
You sure?

30:09.808 --> 30:13.986
I left Thai in the secret fridge
if you want some.

30:14.029 --> 30:15.248
Thanks, man.

30:15.291 --> 30:16.727
Goodbye, my love!

31:54.913 --> 31:57.785
Yo, why is there a fucking couch
in front of the door?

32:05.662 --> 32:06.837
Yo?

32:17.109 --> 32:18.284
Yo!

32:55.930 --> 32:57.105
Shit!

32:58.280 --> 33:00.282
What the fuck, Dylan?

33:00.326 --> 33:01.980
Dude, I thought you were
out with the guys.

33:02.023 --> 33:04.243
You scared the fuck
out of me.

33:04.286 --> 33:06.723
Why'’d you dress up
like a fucking psycho?

33:06.767 --> 33:08.856
Yo, can you help me
move this couch?

33:19.214 --> 33:20.563
-

33:21.651 --> 33:22.870
Fuck! Ah!

33:25.394 --> 33:27.005
Aah!

33:36.188 --> 33:37.841
Help!

34:47.041 --> 34:48.869
-

35:21.945 --> 35:24.122
I just don'’t know why
you got her so fucked up.

35:24.165 --> 35:26.298
I don'’t know what to say.
You should go talk to Beau...

36:20.178 --> 36:21.744
Yo, Beau.

36:21.788 --> 36:24.007
You left too?
We should have cruise-pooled.

36:24.051 --> 36:25.705
Dude, the door'’s blocked.
No one'’s answering.

36:25.748 --> 36:27.359
I just tried to get in
through a window.

36:27.402 --> 36:29.926
What the fuck, man?
It'’s not budging.

36:29.970 --> 36:31.537
Come help me.

36:36.716 --> 36:39.197
Dude, what the fuck?

36:39.240 --> 36:41.068
Who the shit
that put that here?

36:42.809 --> 36:44.027
Oh!

36:45.420 --> 36:46.987
Oh, shit.

36:47.030 --> 36:48.206
Yo!

36:54.037 --> 36:55.604
Dude, what the fuck is this?

36:55.648 --> 36:57.215
Is that blood?

37:43.783 --> 37:46.264
-

38:34.137 --> 38:36.357
Hi. Miss Ellery Scott?

38:36.401 --> 38:38.098
Yes?

38:38.141 --> 38:40.187
My name is Adam Tahan.

38:40.230 --> 38:42.276
I'’m the university chief.

38:42.320 --> 38:46.802
This is Officer Rico Martinez,
Hillsboro PD, violent crimes.

38:46.846 --> 38:48.326
Violent crimes?

38:48.369 --> 38:49.979
Yes, Miss Scott...

38:50.023 --> 38:53.766
we'’d like to ask you to, um,
gather up your things

38:53.809 --> 38:55.115
and if you could--

38:55.158 --> 38:56.421
If you could come with us.

38:58.597 --> 39:00.512
I'’m-- Is everything okay?

39:02.078 --> 39:03.515
Something'’s happened
with your brother.

39:03.558 --> 39:05.386
My brother?

39:05.430 --> 39:08.128
We just found him
at his fraternity.

39:08.171 --> 39:09.347
He'’s dead.

39:16.354 --> 39:17.529
Wait...

39:18.834 --> 39:21.228
Um...no.

39:21.271 --> 39:24.057
He-- Uh, he just texted me.

39:24.100 --> 39:26.059
I'’m sorry, Miss Scott.

39:26.102 --> 39:28.017
Um...

39:28.061 --> 39:29.410
I'’m going to call him.

39:29.454 --> 39:30.629
What?

39:34.633 --> 39:36.330
Talking to the best.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.158
You know it'’s Wes.
Hang up and message me.

39:41.466 --> 39:43.076
-Miss Scott, if you could--
-Umm, wait.

39:43.119 --> 39:44.817
-Sorry, just get--
-

39:44.860 --> 39:46.862
Talking to the best,
you know it'’s Wes.

39:46.906 --> 39:48.560
Hang up and message me.

39:48.603 --> 39:51.301
Look, Miss Scott, I'’m sorry.

39:51.345 --> 39:53.260
Wait, hang on. I--

39:53.303 --> 39:54.827
Talking to the best,
you know it'’s Wes...

39:54.870 --> 39:56.306
Oh, my God.

39:57.873 --> 39:59.571
-

39:59.614 --> 40:01.703
Miss Scott,
your brother is dead.

40:01.747 --> 40:03.531
I'’m going to call my dad.
I'’m going to--

40:05.011 --> 40:06.708
Wait...

40:06.752 --> 40:08.231
Wait, what?

40:08.275 --> 40:09.929
This is--
Wait, no, I'’m just--

40:09.972 --> 40:12.845
Let me-- Let me--
Let me just call him.

40:12.888 --> 40:14.455
Talking to the best,
you know it'’s Wes.

40:14.499 --> 40:15.717
Hang up and message me.

40:15.761 --> 40:17.502
I don'’t want to come with you!

40:17.545 --> 40:19.155
I want to talk to my brother.

40:26.772 --> 40:28.426
We have one victim,

40:28.469 --> 40:30.340
and are still looking
for a suspect.

40:30.384 --> 40:32.430
Please call us if you have
any information.

40:32.473 --> 40:35.433
Now, the Whiton University
chancellor, Dr. Bruce Van Horn,

40:35.476 --> 40:37.173
would like to say
a few words.

40:42.962 --> 40:44.398
Thanks for coming.

40:46.313 --> 40:49.664
Tonight has been one of the most
difficult nights

40:49.708 --> 40:51.187
of my career.

40:53.102 --> 40:57.411
Wes Scott was a shining example
of the university'’s core values.

40:59.544 --> 41:01.502
He embodied everything
that we want

41:01.546 --> 41:03.765
out of our student athletes.

41:03.809 --> 41:06.507
Hard work. Discipline.
Intensity.

41:07.726 --> 41:09.075
I was very fortunate

41:09.118 --> 41:11.338
that I knew Wes personally.

41:12.731 --> 41:15.777
The university
will cooperate fully

41:15.821 --> 41:19.564
with our own police department,
as well as the City PD,

41:19.607 --> 41:20.913
so that we can...

41:22.697 --> 41:26.875
so that we can bring justice
for Wes.

41:29.356 --> 41:30.488
Thank you.

41:33.752 --> 41:35.841
-I need to say something.
-Oh. Yes, please.

41:37.625 --> 41:39.497
I just want to take a moment

41:39.540 --> 41:43.239
to reflect on what
a special individual Wes was.

41:43.283 --> 41:47.548
Just yesterday, we were
discussing his Olympic dream,

41:47.592 --> 41:49.071
and, um...

41:50.899 --> 41:52.727
well, to see that taken away
from him is...

41:56.688 --> 41:58.559
I just hope
his legacy lives on.

42:00.605 --> 42:02.563
Thank you.
That'’s all for now.

42:06.654 --> 42:08.526
It really
looks like we could get

42:08.569 --> 42:11.354
only one call
until tomorrow morning.

42:11.398 --> 42:13.531
I'’ll let you know
if we get anything sooner.

42:13.574 --> 42:16.621
Keep your phone with you
in case Mom or I call.

42:16.664 --> 42:18.013
And stay with the police.

42:18.057 --> 42:20.276
Be strong, baby.
I love you.

42:20.320 --> 42:21.713
You too.

42:25.630 --> 42:27.545
-

42:29.634 --> 42:32.288
He said he'’s going to call you
when he gets to the airport.

42:33.681 --> 42:35.335
Okay.

42:35.378 --> 42:38.120
Want to sit over here
while we wait?

43:07.802 --> 43:10.283
Listen, how long is this
going to take?

43:10.326 --> 43:12.111
Not long.

43:20.946 --> 43:22.556
-Here we go.
- Hey.

43:27.300 --> 43:29.650
-Fitzgerald?
-Yeah?

43:31.565 --> 43:33.654
That'’s my student,
this is my campus,

43:33.698 --> 43:35.482
which means that I will
be in there

43:35.525 --> 43:37.615
for every minute
of your questioning.

43:39.268 --> 43:40.574
By all means.

43:43.577 --> 43:44.796
After you.

43:47.712 --> 43:49.191
-Detective?
-Yeah?

43:50.715 --> 43:52.151
So, Evidence Collection
dropped this off.

43:52.194 --> 43:55.110
I wanted you to see it
before they process it.

44:00.768 --> 44:02.074
Thank you.

44:03.075 --> 44:05.686
Um, Miss Scott,

44:05.730 --> 44:07.079
you can wait here.

44:07.122 --> 44:08.515
There'’s a little more
privacy.

44:08.558 --> 44:09.864
What was that?

44:09.908 --> 44:11.518
This is my office.

44:12.650 --> 44:14.086
Can I get you anything?

44:25.967 --> 44:29.101
Miss Scott, you thirsty?

44:30.189 --> 44:31.581
You should drink
some water.

44:36.325 --> 44:38.545
Do you have any friends
coming to pick you up?

44:40.634 --> 44:42.810
My friend Shayleen.

44:42.854 --> 44:44.507
And Malik.

44:44.551 --> 44:45.683
Okay.

44:46.727 --> 44:48.511
Well, if you want to...

44:48.555 --> 44:50.557
Do you want to lay down?

44:50.600 --> 44:52.864
I can bring her back
when she gets here.

44:55.431 --> 44:57.346
Okay.

44:57.390 --> 45:00.132
I'’ll be outside
if you need anything.

45:00.175 --> 45:01.699
Did you find him?

45:07.008 --> 45:08.575
No.

45:08.618 --> 45:10.185
His fraternity brothers.

45:11.665 --> 45:14.059
I was the first officer
on scene, though.

45:15.016 --> 45:16.452
Was he alive when--?

45:16.496 --> 45:18.063
Was he alive
when you found him?

45:21.153 --> 45:22.371
No.

45:24.199 --> 45:25.505
Was it bad?

45:27.246 --> 45:29.814
It was bad. Oh, my God.

45:34.993 --> 45:36.864
Now, Mr. Vaughn.

45:36.908 --> 45:38.823
Beau.

45:38.866 --> 45:42.870
If this is the Sigma Nu Pi
house...

45:42.914 --> 45:44.263
here'’s the front door.

45:44.306 --> 45:47.483
These are the bushes
along the front.

45:47.527 --> 45:50.182
Can you draw the exact path
that you walked

45:50.225 --> 45:52.793
with Mr. Davenport
before entering?

45:52.837 --> 45:54.926
So I came up
to the front door.

45:54.969 --> 45:57.276
Like I said, it wouldn'’t open
and no one was answering.

45:57.319 --> 45:59.017
So I came around
to the side.

45:59.060 --> 46:00.409
There'’s a window
right here.

46:00.453 --> 46:02.107
Tried to get in,
but it was locked.

46:02.150 --> 46:04.849
So I came around to the front,
and there was Dylan.

46:04.892 --> 46:08.635
So you were at this spot
when you saw Mr. Davenport?

46:08.678 --> 46:10.680
Yeah.

46:10.724 --> 46:12.247
You sure?

46:12.291 --> 46:14.772
Yes, I'’m sure.

46:21.517 --> 46:23.432
Have you seen
this hammer before?

46:24.782 --> 46:25.957
No.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.393
Do you recognize it?

46:27.436 --> 46:29.134
He said he'’s never
seen it before.

46:29.177 --> 46:31.745
This was found in the exact spot
you just said you were.

46:31.789 --> 46:33.791
-Okay, that'’s enough.
-Did you see anyone else around?

46:33.834 --> 46:35.531
No, but I-I-I wasn'’t--

46:35.575 --> 46:37.664
Why did you come back
before your other friends?

46:37.707 --> 46:40.188
Do not answer that.
We are done with the questions.

46:40.232 --> 46:41.842
Mr. Vaughn, listen to me.

46:41.886 --> 46:44.889
Your son is involved
in a very serious situation.

46:44.932 --> 46:48.806
No, I see what'’s happening here.
We are done.

46:48.849 --> 46:52.200
I can'’t believe y'all called me
out of work for this bullshit.

46:52.244 --> 46:54.812
Let'’s get the hell out of here,
Beau.

46:58.293 --> 47:00.513
This is bullshit!

47:00.556 --> 47:02.515
I spent all this money,
for what?

47:02.558 --> 47:04.299
-Fuck this!
-Oh, thanks.

47:04.343 --> 47:06.693
Can you send this to Forensics?
Thanks.

47:09.522 --> 47:12.655
This is a fucking shit show,
okay?

47:12.699 --> 47:14.309
I'’ll be in touch in the morning.

47:14.353 --> 47:16.050
We have a lot of important
alumni here this week.

47:16.094 --> 47:17.878
Get this done!

47:19.358 --> 47:20.533
One second.

47:30.543 --> 47:35.722
Ellery, I want you to know
how sorry I am about Wes.

47:35.765 --> 47:39.682
You can'’t imagine how many times
I pictured him

47:39.726 --> 47:42.076
representing this school
on the Olympic podium.

47:44.600 --> 47:46.951
You know that you can come to me
with anything, right?

47:48.866 --> 47:50.084
Your brother did.

47:53.261 --> 47:55.046
Now, get some rest.

48:02.923 --> 48:05.404
-Ellery, hi.

48:05.447 --> 48:07.885
You need some sleep.
Let'’s get you home, okay?

48:09.408 --> 48:10.713
Come on.

48:57.456 --> 48:58.979
Hey, babe, what'’s up?

48:59.023 --> 49:00.546
Hey, babe.

49:00.589 --> 49:01.808
How'’s she holding up?

49:01.851 --> 49:03.810
Not good.

49:03.853 --> 49:06.421
Her parents won'’t get here
until tonight, so it'’s hard.

49:07.814 --> 49:09.947
-Are you at the gym?
-Yeah.

49:09.990 --> 49:11.644
Just going to work out,
clear my head.

49:11.687 --> 49:12.993
You going to class tonight?

49:13.037 --> 49:15.169
Um, I don'’t know.

49:15.213 --> 49:16.866
I skipped this morning
to stay here,

49:16.910 --> 49:20.174
so I guess I'’ll just see
how she'’s feeling.

49:20.218 --> 49:21.741
-Why?
-I just don'’t want you

49:21.784 --> 49:23.438
walking around alone
at night.

49:23.482 --> 49:26.398
There'’s patrol cars
on every corner.

49:26.441 --> 49:29.531
Yeah, I would just feel better
if you were with me.

49:29.575 --> 49:31.316
Well, look, they should
release us around 5:30.

49:31.359 --> 49:35.320
So just let me know
if you go to class or not.

49:35.363 --> 49:38.018
Okay, I'’ll text you either way.

49:38.062 --> 49:40.107
I'’ll see you soon.
Be safe.

49:40.151 --> 49:41.761
I will. Bye.

49:57.516 --> 49:59.605
Hey. Sorry.

49:59.648 --> 50:02.260
One of the officers
is here asking for you.

50:17.405 --> 50:18.798
Officer?

50:20.321 --> 50:24.064
Hey, I'’m sorry to bother you,
Miss Scott,

50:24.108 --> 50:26.893
but we'’ve been trying to get
a hold of you all morning,

50:26.936 --> 50:28.982
and all the calls have been
going straight to voicemail.

50:29.026 --> 50:31.115
And your parents
even called the station.

50:33.900 --> 50:36.468
Oh, shit. I, um...

50:36.511 --> 50:38.513
I put it on silent.

50:38.557 --> 50:40.646
-Sorry.
-Well, I'’d...

50:40.689 --> 50:43.214
I'’d freak out too if I couldn't
get a hold of my daughter.

50:43.257 --> 50:44.824
Yeah.

50:44.867 --> 50:46.565
Well, the reason
we were calling

50:46.608 --> 50:48.610
is because we'’d like to schedule
an interview for you

50:48.654 --> 50:50.917
-with Detective Fitzgerald.
-Me?

50:50.960 --> 50:52.962
Would tomorrow afternoon
be okay?

50:53.006 --> 50:54.355
Um...

50:57.054 --> 50:59.578
Can I talk to my parents
about that?

50:59.621 --> 51:02.494
Of course.
I totally understand.

51:02.537 --> 51:05.627
We'’ll get in touch with you
tomorrow morning then?

51:05.671 --> 51:07.194
Okay.

51:09.501 --> 51:11.416
Oh, and Miss Scott...

51:13.766 --> 51:15.202
you have my word
that I'’m going to find

51:15.246 --> 51:17.030
the person responsible
for this.

51:18.945 --> 51:20.077
Yeah.

51:25.386 --> 51:27.127
-

51:27.171 --> 51:28.346
Hello?

51:28.389 --> 51:29.869
Hello there.

51:29.912 --> 51:32.001
I'’m Dana Thompson
with Student Affairs.

51:32.045 --> 51:33.742
Dr. Van Horn'’s assistant.

51:33.786 --> 51:36.658
I'’m so sorry for your loss.

51:36.702 --> 51:40.053
He'’s checking in,
and he wanted to know

51:40.097 --> 51:43.535
if you could stop by his office
before he'’s gone for the day?

51:43.578 --> 51:48.061
Between 6:00 and 6:30?

51:48.105 --> 51:50.324
Can I come another day?

51:50.368 --> 51:52.892
He did say that it was
very important.

51:52.935 --> 51:54.894
I'’m so sorry.

51:54.937 --> 51:56.113
Okay.

51:57.201 --> 51:58.854
Um, I'’ll come by.

51:58.898 --> 52:00.291
Thank you.

52:00.334 --> 52:01.901
I'’ll let him know.

52:05.034 --> 52:06.993
What'’s going on?

52:07.036 --> 52:10.301
Dr. Van Horn wants me
to come by his office today.

52:10.344 --> 52:12.129
-Why?

52:14.261 --> 52:16.742
Uh, his assistant said
it was important.

52:18.222 --> 52:19.701
Well, I'’m going
to come with you,

52:19.745 --> 52:21.181
and Malik is walking us.

52:21.225 --> 52:22.530
And we can meet him
on the way.

52:24.228 --> 52:26.926
I don'’t want those
fucking flowers up here.

52:26.969 --> 52:29.102
No problem.

52:29.146 --> 52:34.629
Um, the girls just wanted
to do something nice for you.

52:39.765 --> 52:42.028
-Come in.

52:43.334 --> 52:44.552
Somebody left these
at the door.

52:44.596 --> 52:45.988
Just leave them outside,

52:46.032 --> 52:47.207
and just come in
and close the door.

52:51.820 --> 52:53.082
Man, I'’ve got a headache.

52:54.736 --> 52:56.956
I can-- I can go
grab you a coffee.

52:56.999 --> 52:58.523
No, I just--

52:58.566 --> 53:00.307
I need to get out
of this house.

53:00.351 --> 53:02.527
Yeah, we can go get a coffee,

53:02.570 --> 53:05.312
and you should probably eat
something too.

53:05.356 --> 53:06.922
And what'’re you up to?

53:06.966 --> 53:08.968
Oh, I-I have class.
I just came by to--

53:09.011 --> 53:10.187
Hey, Kylie, I...

53:11.623 --> 53:13.973
You forgot your shorts
at homecoming.

53:14.016 --> 53:15.192
Thanks.

53:16.541 --> 53:18.456
Well, we'’re heading
to campus too,

53:18.499 --> 53:21.023
so why don'’t we just
all go together?

53:22.634 --> 53:25.245
Um, yeah. Yeah, cool.

53:47.049 --> 53:49.400
So your statement says

53:49.443 --> 53:52.272
the last time you saw Mr. Vaughn
and Mr. Scott together

53:52.316 --> 53:54.187
was late Saturday,
early Sunday?

53:55.319 --> 53:56.537
Is...

53:56.581 --> 53:57.799
is Beau in trouble?

53:57.843 --> 53:59.540
Why do you ask that?

53:59.584 --> 54:02.151
Well, they were asking
a lot of questions about him,

54:02.195 --> 54:06.112
and I told them I thought
he was acting weird.

54:06.155 --> 54:07.592
What do you mean by weird?

54:07.635 --> 54:10.203
I just can'’t stop
seeing Beau

54:10.247 --> 54:12.379
coming from the side
of the house.

54:13.685 --> 54:16.209
And then I saw Wes, and...

54:17.950 --> 54:20.866
I don'’t know, it just left a...
left a strange feeling.

54:27.829 --> 54:29.657
I don'’t know.

54:31.616 --> 54:35.533
Last year when Wes got
our fraternity in trouble...

54:35.576 --> 54:37.404
What happened last year?

54:37.448 --> 54:40.581
He'’s the reason that we were
on social probation.

54:44.977 --> 54:46.239
Beau wanted him out.

54:50.374 --> 54:52.245
How do you know
he wanted him out?

54:52.289 --> 54:53.942
Told me.

54:56.380 --> 54:59.034
Tell me about their interactions
together Saturday night.

55:00.384 --> 55:01.907
Beau and Wes were...

55:01.950 --> 55:06.346
were acting cool,
but I know...

55:07.913 --> 55:09.480
I know Beau messed with Wes.

55:09.523 --> 55:10.829
Messed with him how?

55:10.872 --> 55:12.439
Took him to Beau'’s room.

55:12.483 --> 55:13.745
Just the two of them?

55:13.788 --> 55:16.487
There was a...
a girl with them.

55:16.530 --> 55:19.054
-Who was the girl?
-I'’m not good with names.

55:19.098 --> 55:20.360
I just met her that night.

55:20.404 --> 55:21.753
You were in the room
with them?

55:21.796 --> 55:23.537
Oh, no. No.

55:23.581 --> 55:25.757
I...

55:25.800 --> 55:29.891
I was following them in there,
but um, Beau locked the door.

55:29.935 --> 55:32.372
-Why?
-Does that sometimes.

55:32.416 --> 55:35.332
He just locks you out?

55:35.375 --> 55:37.290
Or whatever.

55:37.334 --> 55:38.987
We'’re...we're cool.

55:39.031 --> 55:41.686
Are you always the sucker
who just keeps watch?

55:47.431 --> 55:49.520
How did he mess with Wes?

55:50.869 --> 55:52.610
Beau took his phone.

55:52.653 --> 55:56.265
Started posting some stuff
on that girl'’s account.

55:56.309 --> 56:00.139
We'’ve had some issues
of cyberbullying on campus.

56:00.182 --> 56:03.447
Uh, boys calling out girls
on social media

56:03.490 --> 56:04.970
after hooking up
with them.

56:05.013 --> 56:07.364
It'’s...it's a crude game.

56:07.407 --> 56:08.974
What do they post?

56:10.758 --> 56:12.586
An exclamation point.

56:15.502 --> 56:17.156
May I uh,
may I go to the restroom?

56:20.115 --> 56:23.031
Or how much longer
do you think this will take?

56:24.424 --> 56:26.818
We'’re done. For now.

56:28.341 --> 56:30.430
Oh, and thanks again
for your cooperation.

56:30.474 --> 56:32.432
Thank you.

56:34.869 --> 56:37.394
- Come on in, officers.

56:37.437 --> 56:39.744
Detective,
we dug these up for you.

56:39.787 --> 56:41.049
Thank you.

56:42.964 --> 56:44.966
Oh, so you knew
about this game?

56:45.010 --> 56:48.535
Well, not much goes on in this
campus that I don'’t know about.

56:53.366 --> 56:55.020
Like the fact
that Mr. Scott

56:55.063 --> 56:58.458
was involved in a sexual assault
accusation last year?

56:58.502 --> 57:01.330
He had some fingers
pointed at him in an incident.

57:01.374 --> 57:05.465
Turned it into a, "he said,
she said" and case was dropped.

57:05.509 --> 57:08.207
Look, trust me,
a Title IX representative

57:08.250 --> 57:09.469
thoroughly investigated it.

57:09.513 --> 57:11.123
But the school
looked into it?

57:11.166 --> 57:13.473
The Student Affairs office
handles these cases.

57:13.517 --> 57:15.301
Dr. Van Horn?

57:16.433 --> 57:17.564
Detective...

57:19.044 --> 57:22.264
remember, you are dealing
with legacy now.

57:22.308 --> 57:26.660
Mr. Scott is very well-liked
by this university.

57:26.704 --> 57:28.706
I can see that.

57:30.316 --> 57:32.797
I'’m going to shuttle
the fraternity.

57:32.840 --> 57:34.363
Give me a buzz
if you need anything.

57:34.407 --> 57:36.148
Turn the lights off
when you'’re done.

57:37.671 --> 57:39.456
Hey, Rico, tell me something
good, please.

57:39.499 --> 57:41.588
CSI is going to wrap up
in the crime scene

57:41.632 --> 57:42.850
by this evening.

57:42.894 --> 57:44.330
Forensics called,

57:44.373 --> 57:45.853
couldn'’t find any blood
on the hammer.

57:45.897 --> 57:48.769
-Shocker. Any prints?
-Nothing yet.

57:48.813 --> 57:52.599
And I couldn'’t get his sister's
schedule for tomorrow afternoon.

57:52.643 --> 57:54.645
I'’m going to check back in
with her tomorrow morning

57:54.688 --> 57:56.516
-after her parents get here.
-All right.

57:56.560 --> 57:59.345
Well, keep tabs on the house
until CSI clears.

57:59.388 --> 58:01.347
And dig into these for me,
will you?

58:01.390 --> 58:02.696
Make sure I didn'’t
miss anything.

58:04.785 --> 58:06.526
You good?

58:06.570 --> 58:07.832
Yeah, I will be.

58:50.788 --> 58:52.746
Sorry, man.

58:56.228 --> 58:57.664
-

58:57.708 --> 58:59.187
Yo, someone'’s in here.

59:07.805 --> 59:09.633
What the fuck, man?

59:09.676 --> 59:11.983
Ow! Fuck! Oh, shit!

59:20.644 --> 59:22.384
No, please!

1:00:06.254 --> 1:00:08.169
How'’s your head?

1:00:08.213 --> 1:00:09.649
It'’s okay.

1:00:22.706 --> 1:00:25.099
Hey, Kylie, um,
I need to tell you something.

1:00:26.797 --> 1:00:27.972
Okay?

1:00:31.889 --> 1:00:34.587
Someone accused Wes of something
last year and he...

1:00:36.067 --> 1:00:37.634
said he didn'’t remember.

1:00:37.677 --> 1:00:39.113
And...

1:00:41.768 --> 1:00:43.509
that'’s what he said
about the other night.

1:00:48.296 --> 1:00:49.994
I just felt like you...

1:00:51.343 --> 1:00:53.258
...like you needed to know.

1:00:54.999 --> 1:00:56.827
I'’m so sorry, Kylie.

1:01:05.313 --> 1:01:07.707
Yo.
-What'’s up?

1:01:07.751 --> 1:01:11.015
So, Malik just wasted our time.

1:01:11.058 --> 1:01:12.843
Where is he?

1:01:12.886 --> 1:01:15.715
Well, he just texted me
that he'’s really sorry,

1:01:15.759 --> 1:01:18.457
but the coach
had to keep him.

1:01:18.500 --> 1:01:19.893
Let'’s just roll.

1:01:19.937 --> 1:01:21.460
Yeah.

1:01:21.503 --> 1:01:23.767
We can, uh, stop by your class
on the way.

1:01:23.810 --> 1:01:26.421
Yeah, I'’m just going to skip.
It'’s Film Lit.

1:01:26.465 --> 1:01:28.467
I slept through that whole
class. You'’re fine.

1:01:28.510 --> 1:01:31.513
Plus, now we can all
get food together?

1:01:52.230 --> 1:01:54.841
They'’re putting us up
in some shithole dorm.

1:01:54.885 --> 1:01:57.714
Well, how many fucking nights
are you going to be there?

1:01:57.757 --> 1:01:59.454
-The rest of the week.
-What the hell?

1:01:59.498 --> 1:02:00.717
It'’s going to take that long?

1:02:00.760 --> 1:02:02.588
Yeah. I don'’t know.

1:02:02.631 --> 1:02:04.764
Now guys are telling me they
want to move out of the house.

1:02:04.808 --> 1:02:06.505
Oh, that'’s bullshit.

1:02:06.548 --> 1:02:08.681
Where'’s their fucking loyalty,
Beau?

1:02:08.725 --> 1:02:10.422
I don'’t want
to talk about it.

1:02:11.771 --> 1:02:13.425
Listen, it'’s a damn shame

1:02:13.468 --> 1:02:15.340
the way the school'’s
treating you right now.

1:02:15.383 --> 1:02:17.472
They'’re not going to get away
with this, son.

1:02:17.516 --> 1:02:19.344
Not on my damn watch.

1:02:19.387 --> 1:02:21.694
In fact, they'’re all going
to regret this shit.

1:02:21.738 --> 1:02:23.652
Just focus your mind
on something else.

1:02:24.915 --> 1:02:26.133
My ride'’s here.

1:02:26.177 --> 1:02:27.961
I'’ll call you later.

1:02:28.005 --> 1:02:30.790
Remember, Beau,
not a fucking word.

1:02:30.834 --> 1:02:32.270
I know!

1:02:32.313 --> 1:02:34.315
Don'’t you fucking "I know" me,
boy.

1:02:34.359 --> 1:02:36.622
I'’m serious. Watch it.

1:02:36.665 --> 1:02:38.798
They'’re going to try
to get in your head.

1:02:38.842 --> 1:02:40.844
Just lay low
in your fucking dorm

1:02:40.887 --> 1:02:43.847
until I can sort
this shitstorm out.

1:02:43.890 --> 1:02:45.109
Okay.

1:02:45.152 --> 1:02:46.675
Bye.

1:02:50.854 --> 1:02:53.770
I don'’t give a fuck

1:02:53.813 --> 1:02:56.120
Like drink in a cup

1:02:56.163 --> 1:02:58.862
In my kinda truck

1:02:58.905 --> 1:03:01.821
Yeah, there'’s where I fuck

1:03:03.954 --> 1:03:06.086
I don'’t give a fuck

1:03:06.130 --> 1:03:08.088
Like drink in a cup

1:03:08.132 --> 1:03:10.569
In my kinda truck

1:03:10.612 --> 1:03:12.963
Yeah, there'’s where I fuck

1:03:18.142 --> 1:03:20.666
Found him in the dining room,
nearly decapitated.

1:03:20.709 --> 1:03:22.755
Shh, here he comes.

1:03:24.975 --> 1:03:26.324
Yo, this dorm
is a fucking shithole.

1:03:26.367 --> 1:03:28.282
Where'’s the bathroom?

1:03:28.326 --> 1:03:30.067
Around the corner.

1:03:30.110 --> 1:03:31.503
We all sharing one?

1:03:31.546 --> 1:03:32.721
Yeah, it sucks.

1:03:38.771 --> 1:03:39.946
Are you all right, man?

1:03:41.034 --> 1:03:42.644
Yeah. I'’m good.

1:03:42.688 --> 1:03:44.821
You don'’t need anything, or...?

1:03:46.387 --> 1:03:48.868
No, no. I'’m-- I'm good.

1:03:48.912 --> 1:03:50.435
-All right.
-Hey...

1:03:50.478 --> 1:03:52.089
let'’s round up the boys,
all right?

1:03:52.132 --> 1:03:53.873
Meeting. Thirty minutes.

1:03:58.095 --> 1:03:59.487
All right, let'’s do this.

1:03:59.531 --> 1:04:00.880
Has anyone seen Dylan?

1:05:27.140 --> 1:05:28.533
Yeah! Yeah! Oh, fuck.

1:05:39.979 --> 1:05:42.721
-

1:06:19.062 --> 1:06:20.237
-

1:06:53.835 --> 1:06:55.315
Miss Scott?

1:06:55.359 --> 1:06:56.664
Perfect.

1:06:56.708 --> 1:06:58.753
They just got back
to his office.

1:06:58.797 --> 1:07:00.190
Okay.

1:07:00.233 --> 1:07:02.061
I bet you'’re eager
to get home too.

1:07:04.542 --> 1:07:05.978
Follow me.

1:07:29.175 --> 1:07:31.177
I'’m so sorry.

1:07:31.221 --> 1:07:32.657
I tried calling you.

1:07:33.745 --> 1:07:35.138
Where'’s the bathroom?

1:07:35.181 --> 1:07:37.227
-It'’s right down here.
-Thank you.

1:07:37.270 --> 1:07:39.751
All right, Bruce.
I'’ll see you tomorrow.

1:07:39.794 --> 1:07:41.100
-Good night, Dana.
-Good night.

1:07:43.146 --> 1:07:46.149
Look, I-I don'’t want to take up
a whole bunch of your time.

1:07:46.192 --> 1:07:49.108
I just wanted to talk
about some private matters,

1:07:49.152 --> 1:07:50.501
if that'’s okay
with you ladies?

1:07:50.544 --> 1:07:52.242
It won'’t take long.

1:07:52.285 --> 1:07:54.287
We'’ll be in the courtyard.

1:07:54.331 --> 1:07:55.810
Yeah.

1:07:58.161 --> 1:08:00.946
Please, come in.
Have a seat.

1:08:18.616 --> 1:08:20.487
It got dark fast.

1:08:22.141 --> 1:08:23.751
There'’s no way for me
to charge my phone?

1:08:23.795 --> 1:08:25.927
Um...

1:08:25.971 --> 1:08:27.755
no, I don'’t think so.

1:08:39.463 --> 1:08:44.076
Again, I'’m sorry that you have
to be here today of all days,

1:08:44.120 --> 1:08:46.687
but this information
was just given to me,

1:08:46.731 --> 1:08:50.387
and I felt that we should
deal with it immediately.

1:08:50.430 --> 1:08:52.737
Of course, I will take
into consideration

1:08:52.780 --> 1:08:56.610
that you'’ve just suffered
a substantial loss.

1:08:56.654 --> 1:08:58.264
But...

1:08:59.526 --> 1:09:01.180
can you tell me...

1:09:01.224 --> 1:09:03.051
ahem, what that is?

1:09:04.357 --> 1:09:07.882
It'’s just a sequence.

1:09:07.926 --> 1:09:13.149
This is an unauthorized use of
university facilities and money.

1:09:28.903 --> 1:09:30.078
Come on!

1:09:31.428 --> 1:09:32.864
Shit.

1:09:34.474 --> 1:09:35.954
Fuck.

1:09:39.262 --> 1:09:42.700
Hey, uh, do you know how we'’re
supposed to get out of here?

1:09:44.223 --> 1:09:45.442
The door.

1:09:46.791 --> 1:09:48.358
Oh, yeah. Okay.

1:09:48.401 --> 1:09:49.881
Thanks.

1:09:56.453 --> 1:09:58.237
Um, bathroom break?

1:10:11.076 --> 1:10:12.773
- What a creep.

1:10:14.297 --> 1:10:15.559
I really need to leave.

1:10:15.602 --> 1:10:17.256
Oh, um, okay.

1:10:17.300 --> 1:10:19.215
If you want to call a car,
no pressure to wait.

1:10:19.258 --> 1:10:21.129
I just don'’t have
any service.

1:10:21.173 --> 1:10:22.435
-I can call it.
-

1:10:26.961 --> 1:10:29.225
Wi-Fi'’s weak too.

1:10:36.536 --> 1:10:38.059
Hey, are you okay?

1:10:43.021 --> 1:10:45.763
Ellery just told me
everything about Wes.

1:10:45.806 --> 1:10:47.982
About what?

1:10:48.026 --> 1:10:50.376
Did you know
about last year?

1:10:50.420 --> 1:10:52.465
Not a lot.

1:10:56.774 --> 1:10:58.776
I really need to be alone
right now, okay?

1:10:58.819 --> 1:11:00.256
Okay.

1:11:00.299 --> 1:11:01.518
I'’ll be in the courtyard.

1:11:23.627 --> 1:11:25.846
What were you
sequencing?

1:11:28.675 --> 1:11:30.808
It was a DNA test.

1:11:30.851 --> 1:11:32.288
For what?

1:11:34.115 --> 1:11:36.292
I was seeing if I could match
someone'’s DNA

1:11:36.335 --> 1:11:38.990
to this girl'’s shorts.

1:11:40.383 --> 1:11:42.341
Why would you do that?

1:11:42.385 --> 1:11:45.823
Because she said something
happened to her

1:11:45.866 --> 1:11:48.042
at our homecoming party.

1:11:51.350 --> 1:11:53.831
Don'’t you think
the proper protocol

1:11:53.874 --> 1:11:57.922
would be encouraging your friend
to report the incident?

1:11:57.965 --> 1:12:01.534
This university takes these type
of allegations very seriously,

1:12:01.578 --> 1:12:05.146
and we conduct very thorough
investigations.

1:12:05.190 --> 1:12:07.323
I conducted the sequence...

1:12:09.412 --> 1:12:11.370
because Wes was in the room.

1:12:31.608 --> 1:12:33.958
I'’m sorry.
I'’m really sorry.

1:12:36.221 --> 1:12:37.701
I just, um...

1:12:37.744 --> 1:12:39.616
I knew about last year and I--

1:12:39.659 --> 1:12:42.140
I just really
wanted to know.

1:12:49.495 --> 1:12:51.932
Have you told anyone else
about this?

1:12:51.976 --> 1:12:53.369
No one.

1:12:53.412 --> 1:12:55.806
There could be a lot
of damage done

1:12:55.849 --> 1:12:58.896
if these allegations
were to be made public.

1:12:58.939 --> 1:13:02.116
Not to mention extremely
embarrassing for your family

1:13:02.160 --> 1:13:03.422
and the individual involved.

1:13:03.466 --> 1:13:05.381
Have you thought
about that?

1:13:05.424 --> 1:13:07.295
I wasn'’t going
to tell anyone.

1:13:13.476 --> 1:13:18.655
Ellery, I am willing to keep
this new information between us.

1:13:20.613 --> 1:13:22.833
And I'’m hoping that I can
rely on your discretion

1:13:22.876 --> 1:13:24.269
to do the same.

1:13:25.923 --> 1:13:27.751
You'’ve been through enough,

1:13:27.794 --> 1:13:30.754
and this is something that if it
were to spiral out of control,

1:13:30.797 --> 1:13:32.408
could hurt all of us.

1:13:34.279 --> 1:13:37.413
Plus, we wouldn'’t want
to tarnish Wes'’ reputation,

1:13:37.456 --> 1:13:39.502
now would we?

1:13:39.545 --> 1:13:42.418
-

1:13:43.549 --> 1:13:45.290
Dr. Van Horn, I'’m so sorry.

1:13:45.333 --> 1:13:47.248
Um, I'’m just trying to leave,

1:13:47.292 --> 1:13:49.860
but the doors are locked
or something.

1:13:51.427 --> 1:13:52.993
Then go out back.

1:13:53.037 --> 1:13:54.604
No, those are locked too.

1:13:56.083 --> 1:13:57.476
Has Dana left?

1:13:57.520 --> 1:13:58.956
Yeah, she left already.

1:14:01.567 --> 1:14:03.351
Tyler, I'’ll be right there.

1:14:03.395 --> 1:14:05.484
Okay. Thank you so much.

1:14:15.407 --> 1:14:19.150
I'’m glad that we're on
the same page with this.

1:14:19.193 --> 1:14:22.806
I'’ll make sure that everything
is cleared up in your program.

1:14:28.507 --> 1:14:30.204
Again, I'’m so sorry.
It'’s over here.

1:14:30.248 --> 1:14:31.423
I was trying the door.

1:14:35.819 --> 1:14:37.473
You ready?

1:14:38.604 --> 1:14:39.866
What'’s up?

1:14:39.910 --> 1:14:41.564
I was-- Look, I just need
to leave.

1:14:41.607 --> 1:14:42.913
I'’m trying to call a car.

1:14:42.956 --> 1:14:44.175
Oh, okay.

1:14:44.218 --> 1:14:47.091
Um, well, where'’s Shayleen?

1:14:47.134 --> 1:14:48.614
She'’s waiting
in the courtyard.

1:14:48.658 --> 1:14:50.442
Oh, well,
let'’s just go get her.

1:14:50.486 --> 1:14:51.661
Yeah.

1:14:53.706 --> 1:14:54.881
Shit!

1:15:04.195 --> 1:15:05.588
I tried cutting it, but...

1:15:49.632 --> 1:15:51.242
Oh, my God!

1:16:06.649 --> 1:16:08.651
-

1:16:37.375 --> 1:16:38.898
He fucking broke it.

1:17:33.953 --> 1:17:35.694
Okay. Come, come, come on.

1:17:35.738 --> 1:17:37.783
Watch out. Shit.

1:17:38.871 --> 1:17:40.220
Oh, my God.

1:17:43.267 --> 1:17:44.616
Oh, my God.

1:18:00.806 --> 1:18:03.591
We need to find Shayleen.

1:18:13.253 --> 1:18:14.428
Oh, my God.

1:18:27.354 --> 1:18:28.921
-Fuck.

1:19:25.673 --> 1:19:27.284
Come on. Come on.

1:19:27.327 --> 1:19:28.894
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1:19:36.467 --> 1:19:38.817
-Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.
-

1:19:38.861 --> 1:19:40.819
-Wake up. Wake up.
-Huh?

1:20:15.941 --> 1:20:18.422
911. What'’s your emergency?

1:20:21.077 --> 1:20:23.601
911? What'’s your emergency?

1:20:25.777 --> 1:20:27.431
Please, please,
please send help.

1:20:27.474 --> 1:20:30.260
Please. Whiton University,
Send help.

1:20:30.303 --> 1:20:33.437
Hello? What'’s your emergency?

1:20:33.480 --> 1:20:34.873
-Hello?
-Hello?

1:20:34.917 --> 1:20:36.135
Hello?

1:20:36.179 --> 1:20:38.442
-Hello.
-

1:21:41.113 --> 1:21:42.854
No, no, no.
Please! Please! Please!

1:21:42.898 --> 1:21:45.944
Please! Please! Please! Please!
Please stop that!

1:21:58.565 --> 1:22:00.089
-

1:23:18.732 --> 1:23:21.257
Hey! Stop!

1:23:21.300 --> 1:23:22.867
Wait!

1:23:27.045 --> 1:23:28.960
No! No! No!

1:23:29.004 --> 1:23:30.179
No! No!

1:23:35.097 --> 1:23:37.360
-Fuck you!
-

1:23:37.403 --> 1:23:39.884
No! Shayleen!

1:25:03.272 --> 1:25:05.839
Help! Help!

1:25:05.883 --> 1:25:07.319
Please help!

1:25:41.527 --> 1:25:43.138
Stay there.

1:26:38.889 --> 1:26:40.238
Stay there. Stay.

1:26:40.282 --> 1:26:41.544
What are you doing?

1:26:43.067 --> 1:26:44.416
Stop. We have to hide. Stop.

1:27:12.488 --> 1:27:13.663
-Aah!

1:27:20.191 --> 1:27:22.193
-I'’m not going to hurt you!
-

1:27:23.629 --> 1:27:24.935
I got him!

1:27:24.978 --> 1:27:26.328
Get him!

1:27:28.460 --> 1:27:30.332
Stop!
-

1:27:33.291 --> 1:27:34.945
It'’s me. It's me.
It'’s me.

1:27:37.382 --> 1:27:38.557
Dad?

1:27:40.472 --> 1:27:42.953
Dad, Dad, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

1:27:42.996 --> 1:27:44.215
-What are you doing?
-I'’m sorry.

1:27:44.259 --> 1:27:46.086
No! Daddy!

1:27:46.130 --> 1:27:48.001
I was the first
officer on the scene.

1:27:48.045 --> 1:27:50.395
Forensics called, couldn'’t find any blood on the hammer.

1:27:50.439 --> 1:27:53.006
No, he'’s my dad! Call 911!

1:27:53.050 --> 1:27:54.443
No!

1:27:55.705 --> 1:27:57.315
-No! Daddy!
-I'’m sorry.

1:27:57.359 --> 1:27:59.274
-What did you do?
-I'’m sorry.

1:27:59.317 --> 1:28:01.406
What did you do?

1:28:04.017 --> 1:28:06.542
I'’d freak out too if I couldn't
get ahold of my daughter.

1:28:10.328 --> 1:28:12.330
My dad'’s going to kill me.

1:28:16.378 --> 1:28:19.163
What did you do?
What did you do?

1:28:19.206 --> 1:28:20.860
No! No!

1:28:20.904 --> 1:28:22.645
-I'’m sorry.
-

1:28:22.688 --> 1:28:25.387
Call 911!
We need help!

1:28:25.430 --> 1:28:27.258
We need help!

1:28:27.302 --> 1:28:29.347
Everybody, down!
- On your knees!

1:28:29.391 --> 1:28:30.609
Hands in the air.

1:28:30.653 --> 1:28:32.045
Hands in the air!
Let me see them!

1:28:32.089 --> 1:28:34.352
Get on your knees!
On your knees now!

1:28:34.396 --> 1:28:37.137
No! Dad!

1:28:37.181 --> 1:28:39.836
We need a medic.
We need a medic!

1:28:39.879 --> 1:28:41.794
Dig into these for me, will you?

1:28:41.838 --> 1:28:43.274
Make sure I didn'’t
miss anything.

1:28:43.318 --> 1:28:45.232
Took him to Beau'’s room.

1:28:45.276 --> 1:28:46.495
There was a girl with them.

1:28:46.538 --> 1:28:48.497
I was very fortunate

1:28:48.540 --> 1:28:50.542
that I knew Wes personally.

1:28:50.586 --> 1:28:53.937
We wouldn'’t want to tarnish
Wes'’ reputation now, would we?

1:28:53.980 --> 1:28:56.243
I'’m going to find the person
responsible for this.

1:28:57.375 --> 1:28:59.029
You have my word.

1:29:50.515 --> 1:29:53.170
Hillsboro Police raided
the university building,

1:29:53.213 --> 1:29:56.260
only to discover the school'’s
chancellor, Bruce Van Horn,

1:29:56.303 --> 1:29:58.654
and local police officer,
Rico Martinez,

1:29:58.697 --> 1:30:00.569
both slain in what
investigators

1:30:00.612 --> 1:30:02.701
are calling a bloodbath

1:30:02.745 --> 1:30:05.225
after two more students from the Sigma Nu Pi fraternity

1:30:05.269 --> 1:30:07.445
were discovered brutally
murdered on campus.

1:30:10.187 --> 1:30:12.494
This horrific tragedy,
leaving a total of five...

1:30:12.537 --> 1:30:15.018
Sources tell us they are not
ruling out the possibility

1:30:15.061 --> 1:30:17.455
of a terrorist attack.

1:30:17.499 --> 1:30:19.979
Two witness students whose
names will not be released...

1:30:20.023 --> 1:30:22.460
We know this is the university
chancellor'’s office...

1:30:22.504 --> 1:30:24.680
Three female students
were seen escorted out...

1:30:24.723 --> 1:30:26.725
Witnesses said officers
had to detain them

1:30:26.769 --> 1:30:28.423
due to, quote,
"out-of-control behavior..."

1:30:28.466 --> 1:30:30.468
They did comply with officers.

1:30:30.512 --> 1:30:32.992
Police have yet to confirm
whether a suspect is detained

1:30:33.036 --> 1:30:35.473
-or still at large.
- This tragedy,
leaving five dead...

1:30:35.517 --> 1:30:38.520
Police have yet to confirm
whether a suspect is detained.

1:30:40.522 --> 1:30:42.349
Leaving more
questions than answers

1:30:42.393 --> 1:30:44.308
on the connections between
these brutal slayings...

1:30:44.351 --> 1:30:45.527
I didn'’t know!

1:30:55.014 --> 1:30:56.451
Don'’t let go!

1:30:58.409 --> 1:31:00.367
Ellery! Ellery!

1:31:00.411 --> 1:31:03.066
Ellery, I swear to God,
I didn'’t know.

1:31:03.109 --> 1:31:05.285
Believe me, I didn'’t know!

1:31:09.159 --> 1:31:11.030
Do you have any leads
on a suspect?

1:31:11.074 --> 1:31:13.206
Detective, detective,
anything new you can tell us?

1:31:13.250 --> 1:31:16.253
Any students who
have experienced cyberbullying

1:31:16.296 --> 1:31:18.995
involving an exclamation point, please contact our offices.

1:31:19.038 --> 1:31:20.649
Detective, detective...

1:31:20.692 --> 1:31:22.781
I'’m sorry.

1:31:22.825 --> 1:31:24.566
Did you hear?

1:31:24.609 --> 1:31:26.263
I heard it was
a fucking bloodbath.

1:31:26.306 --> 1:31:28.570
Breaking news from overnight...

1:31:28.613 --> 1:31:30.920
Officers tell us they don'’t
have enough information

1:31:30.963 --> 1:31:32.487
to name a suspect.

1:31:40.582 --> 1:31:44.194
Officers tell us,
no arrests have been made.
