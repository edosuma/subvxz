<i>Class of 199-fucking-9!</i>

00:25.058 --> 00:28.357
<i>Come on, we gotta
party like it's 1999!</i>

00:28.428 --> 00:30.988
<i>I just don't
understand anything.</i>

00:31.064 --> 00:33.362
<i>I don't wanna
face those people.</i>

00:33.433 --> 00:35.492
<i>Only you know
what you want.</i>

00:35.568 --> 00:37.866
<i>I'm stuck with this routine.</i>

00:37.937 --> 00:41.134
<i>It's the last day
of school forever. </i>

01:43.670 --> 01:46.332
Good luck.

01:46.406 --> 01:48.033
Thanks.

01:58.218 --> 02:00.118
Come on, wake up, Julia.

02:00.186 --> 02:02.916
Hm.

02:02.989 --> 02:07.585
Today is the beginning of the
end and the end of the beginning.

02:07.660 --> 02:09.457
And you don't
wanna be late for it.

02:09.529 --> 02:12.327
You always say that.

02:20.540 --> 02:23.873
Angie.

02:23.943 --> 02:27.106
Angie. It's time
to wake up.

02:27.180 --> 02:30.206
<i>It's your last day
in middle school. </i>

02:34.154 --> 02:36.315
You know what
your counselor said.

02:36.389 --> 02:38.823
<i>You won't be able to
finish junior high school</i>

02:38.892 --> 02:41.725
<i>if you miss
one more half day. </i>

02:41.794 --> 02:43.785
<i>Little Angie</i>

02:46.766 --> 02:48.757
Get the fuck out of here!

02:48.835 --> 02:50.894
Unbelievable.

02:50.970 --> 02:51.698
Hm.

03:37.116 --> 03:40.244
I wrote a new
song last night.

03:40.320 --> 03:44.256
Sweet.

03:44.324 --> 03:45.916
We can
practice it later.

03:45.992 --> 03:49.257
Hm.

03:49.329 --> 03:51.593
You want
some of this? Huh?

03:54.968 --> 03:56.902
Last day
of school! Oh, shit!

03:56.970 --> 03:57.994
Oh, shit!

03:59.405 --> 04:01.066
The car,
what the hell.

04:01.140 --> 04:02.937
<i>Fuck you both.</i>

04:03.009 --> 04:05.409
<i>Oh, nice nighty.</i>

04:05.478 --> 04:07.810
I'll see you later.

04:11.451 --> 04:12.918
Shit. Shit!

04:12.986 --> 04:14.544
What's up, ass fuck?

04:14.621 --> 04:16.144
Come on. Come on.

04:16.221 --> 04:18.349
More. More. More!

04:19.692 --> 04:20.817
Oh. God.

04:20.892 --> 04:23.418
What's wrong
with you?

04:23.496 --> 04:24.895
Wow!

04:35.642 --> 04:38.236
I don't even remember when
I actually ever decided

04:38.311 --> 04:40.711
Brown was where I
wanted to got to college.

04:40.780 --> 04:45.217
<i>God. Rhode Island. I'm not
gonna know a single soul.</i>

04:45.285 --> 04:48.277
Man, you know, even
if Brown does suck,

04:48.354 --> 04:51.755
at least you're
experiencing some place new.

04:51.824 --> 04:54.588
I mean, I was looking at
this brochure the other day,

04:54.661 --> 04:56.788
<i>for NYU and my mom
started flipping out</i>

04:56.863 --> 05:00.128
saying that New York
was all about sex and drugs

05:00.199 --> 05:02.292
and I wanted to be,
like, you know what?

05:02.368 --> 05:05.735
I'm not a virgin.
I already have a tattoo

05:05.805 --> 05:07.363
and I do
a ton of drugs here.

05:09.942 --> 05:11.000
Oh, God.

05:39.372 --> 05:41.738
<i>I'm gonna be real
famous some day.</i>

05:41.808 --> 05:43.776
Watch!

05:56.689 --> 05:59.180
<i>Stacy. </i>

05:59.258 --> 06:02.819
<i>Stacey, you forgot
your lunch. Stacey. </i>

06:02.895 --> 06:04.863
Stacey. Stacey.

06:04.931 --> 06:06.728
Mom. Stop saying
my name so much.

06:06.799 --> 06:08.130
You forgot your lunch.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.192
Stacey.

06:10.269 --> 06:11.736
Hi, Mrs. Cherry.

06:11.804 --> 06:15.570
Hello, Julia. Hi.
Say hello, Sockets.

06:15.641 --> 06:16.972
Yeah. Your
dog hates you.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.341
So you guys are ready for summer?

06:19.412 --> 06:20.879
Mom.

06:20.947 --> 06:23.745
Has Stacey been smoking
any of the funny stuff, huh?

06:23.816 --> 06:26.614
Mom. Go in the
house, now. Okay? Bye.

06:26.686 --> 06:27.812
Bye. Say Bye-bye.

06:27.887 --> 06:29.149
<i>Bye. mom. </i>

06:31.991 --> 06:36.485
Oh my God.
My mom is so insane.

06:36.562 --> 06:38.757
I
wouldn't complain,

06:38.831 --> 06:41.095
your boyfriend lives
in your basement

06:41.167 --> 06:43.499
for a year now? And
she still has no clue.

06:43.569 --> 06:46.538
What was I supposed to do?
His grandmother kicked him out.

06:46.606 --> 06:49.803
I'm just saying I can't believe
she still hasn't figured it out.

06:49.876 --> 06:53.573
Well my mom choses what she wants to
know and what she doesn't want to know.

06:53.646 --> 06:56.410
Hm. Kinda like, you.

06:56.482 --> 06:59.451
Hey, Dylan might
treat me like crap

06:59.518 --> 07:03.454
but he's not cheating on me. And if he
cheated on me, then I would dump him.

07:03.522 --> 07:06.184
Let's not talk about it.

07:12.632 --> 07:14.759
Don't do it.

07:14.834 --> 07:17.064
What?

07:18.271 --> 07:19.533
<i>Julia, don't. 
Come on. </i>

07:21.474 --> 07:24.443
This isn't funny You're
gonna hurt our friend.

07:24.510 --> 07:25.670
Ahhh!

07:25.745 --> 07:27.042
<i>There she goes.</i>

07:27.113 --> 07:28.546
Hey, ugly.

07:28.614 --> 07:30.707
Ha, ha, ha.
You're such an ass.

07:30.783 --> 07:34.844
Oh, I know. Come
on, shut up and get in.

07:34.921 --> 07:36.320
<i>I love you.</i>

07:36.389 --> 07:39.085
I hate you.

07:39.158 --> 07:40.819
<i>I know, 
I know. </i>

07:40.893 --> 07:44.852
So you guys are coming to
my pep rally later, right?

07:44.931 --> 07:48.367
Yeah. about that... Nah.

07:48.434 --> 07:50.561
Stop it.
You are coming.

07:50.636 --> 07:52.968
<i>Class of '99.
The sons of bitches.</i>

07:53.039 --> 07:56.031
<i>I can't believe that we
are officially seniors.</i>

07:56.108 --> 07:59.600
Like, next year that's gonna be
out last year. How crazy is that?

07:59.679 --> 08:02.739
Another whole year until we
actually get out of this place.

08:02.815 --> 08:04.476
Exactly.

08:04.550 --> 08:08.577
In the meantime we can still get
really, really, really wasted.

08:08.654 --> 08:12.351
Oh my God. You're
such a cheerleader.

08:21.467 --> 08:23.094
Good morning to you.

08:23.169 --> 08:26.036
<i>I hope this very reliable
tardiness habit of yours</i>

08:26.105 --> 08:28.733
will not be continuing
into the next year.

08:28.808 --> 08:33.472
<i>High school is just one mind
In a whole lot of bodies.</i>

08:33.546 --> 08:36.982
<i>And I know how
that mind thinks. </i>

08:37.049 --> 08:40.985
So keep that in mind.

08:44.957 --> 08:48.120
<i>What is our
purpose? Our meaning?</i>

08:48.194 --> 08:50.992
Why are we all here and what
are we each supposed to do?

08:51.063 --> 08:52.758
<i>Is there some
predetermined plan</i>

08:52.832 --> 08:55.130
<i>driving all the
decisions that we make,</i>

08:55.201 --> 08:57.396
or are we ourselves
making our choices

08:57.470 --> 09:00.234
based on our
own free wills?

09:00.306 --> 09:04.174
<i>These mental thoughts
are liminal phases.</i>

09:04.243 --> 09:06.905
<i>Childhood is about magic, </i>

09:06.979 --> 09:09.607
<i>but teen is about mystery. </i>

09:09.682 --> 09:13.379
It is the time when the
world suddenly gets closer

09:13.452 --> 09:15.181
and the colors get brighter.

09:15.254 --> 09:17.882
<i>Rules seem
ready to be broken. </i>

09:17.957 --> 09:21.518
<i>You all may have
different problems. </i>

09:21.594 --> 09:23.619
<i>But it is the same problem. </i>

09:23.696 --> 09:26.028
You got to figure
out what you want.

09:30.369 --> 09:34.806
Sorry, so, Mod, are you listening
to anything I'm saying? Mod!

09:34.874 --> 09:37.707
<i>Mod!</i>

09:37.777 --> 09:42.476
You look like
a mongoloid baby.

09:44.383 --> 09:46.283
Here.

09:46.352 --> 09:47.944
<i>What's a mangled in baby?</i>

09:48.020 --> 09:49.282
Just... Just...

09:49.355 --> 09:50.822
Weirdo.

09:50.890 --> 09:52.949
Mom give you
lunch money?

09:53.025 --> 09:55.289
Yeah Yeah.

09:55.361 --> 09:59.457
<i>I gotta, I gotta ask you for
a favor I need you to, uh...</i>

10:03.769 --> 10:05.703
I need you to... Uh...

10:05.771 --> 10:08.171
<i>I need you to
sell. All of this. </i>

10:08.240 --> 10:11.175
I need you to sell everything
in there. Yeah? Is that cool?

10:11.243 --> 10:13.006
It's my last
day at school, man.

10:13.079 --> 10:14.546
It's your last
day at school?

10:14.614 --> 10:16.809
Yeah. Before summer.

10:16.882 --> 10:19.942
You mean you're like leaving
for college or something...

10:20.019 --> 10:21.145
No, man. I'm a Junior.

10:21.220 --> 10:22.687
Oh, good. Uh...

10:22.755 --> 10:24.416
<i>There's a big
ass party tonight. </i>

10:24.490 --> 10:26.685
Really? Where?

10:26.759 --> 10:29.557
I don't have a
fucking clue.

10:29.629 --> 10:33.030
<i>Here. </i>

10:33.099 --> 10:35.397
<i>Peace out. </i>

10:36.869 --> 10:38.860
Smoke that weed, bitch.

10:59.592 --> 11:02.220
<i>What it is the
never ending equation</i>

11:02.294 --> 11:04.524
<i>otherwise known as chaos?</i>

11:04.597 --> 11:09.330
<i>Chaos theory is really about
finding the underlying order</i>

11:09.402 --> 11:11.165
<i>apparently random things</i>

11:11.237 --> 11:12.261
Mod.

11:12.338 --> 11:13.600
<i>Speaking in... </i>

11:13.673 --> 11:15.800
You're in
the wrong class.

11:15.875 --> 11:19.504
<i>That the entire
human world might be... </i>

11:19.578 --> 11:22.411
What's up, Sylvia?

11:22.481 --> 11:26.508
<i>Which states
that we are all part</i>

11:26.585 --> 11:29.748
of some greater order.

11:29.822 --> 11:31.289
<i>Mod. </i>

11:33.626 --> 11:36.925
<i>Aw, come on.</i>

11:36.996 --> 11:39.055
You girls
want some weed?

11:39.131 --> 11:42.794
<i>You've all played
dominoes. When you topple one</i>

11:42.868 --> 11:46.269
<i>the others fall In suit. This
would be an isolated system</i>

11:46.338 --> 11:49.501
<i>except for the fact that
something outside the system</i>

11:49.575 --> 11:54.478
<i>Yeah, Mod. </i>

11:54.547 --> 11:55.946
He didn't take a hall pass.

11:56.015 --> 11:58.449
Oh, he's got a permanent
note, Mr. Shapiro.

11:58.517 --> 11:59.950
You know, for ADHD.

12:00.019 --> 12:02.283
<i>He'd better not miss
my frigging pep really. </i>

12:02.354 --> 12:04.982
Don't forget it.
It's during last period.

12:05.057 --> 12:06.081
Okay.

12:06.158 --> 12:07.682
I will be tumbling.

12:09.261 --> 12:11.786
I just want to remind
everybody of the pep rally.

12:11.864 --> 12:13.161
<i>Oh, great.</i>

12:13.232 --> 12:16.099
The spirit
is important.

12:16.168 --> 12:18.136
I don't want to
see one empty seat.

12:18.204 --> 12:19.865
<i>Pull your skirt up!</i>

12:19.939 --> 12:21.167
So, you
should all come.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.901
<i>Okay?</i>

12:22.975 --> 12:25.603
<i>In the larger systems...</i>

12:31.551 --> 12:33.917
You'd better run, bitch.

12:40.326 --> 12:42.089
I gotta shit.

12:42.161 --> 12:44.254
Oh, yeah.

12:44.330 --> 12:45.524
<i>What's up, babe?</i>

12:45.598 --> 12:47.327
How are you doing?

12:47.399 --> 12:49.765
How you doing
son? Hey, hey.

12:49.835 --> 12:51.996
Why don't you come to
our show tonight? Huh?

12:52.071 --> 12:54.301
Come on, we gotta go.
Gotta run. And just go.

12:54.373 --> 12:56.500
Ah!

12:56.575 --> 13:00.944
<i>Jesus.</i>

13:01.013 --> 13:03.072
See you.

13:12.258 --> 13:13.316
Hey.

13:13.392 --> 13:14.654
What's up. Hey.

13:14.727 --> 13:16.820
You suck.

13:16.896 --> 13:18.090
Hey. Uh!

13:28.741 --> 13:31.505
Dude, remember that
time that I got so wasted

13:31.577 --> 13:33.442
that I pissed
on your sock drawer?

13:33.513 --> 13:36.812
And I didn't tell you about it
for like three months or something.

13:36.882 --> 13:39.783
Okay. You better just
come to my pep rally.

13:39.852 --> 13:41.649
<i>Hi, guys.</i>

13:41.720 --> 13:44.553
Guess what?
The Banks have shrooms.

13:44.623 --> 13:46.648
Hey, I told
her that.

13:46.725 --> 13:49.626
Oh my God, we should totally
trip our faces off later.

13:49.695 --> 13:50.787
Yeah.

13:50.863 --> 13:52.353
How much
do they have?

13:52.431 --> 13:54.899
See what you've done
to her? Nice work.

13:54.967 --> 13:56.935
Hanky, have
you seen Pete?

13:57.002 --> 14:00.631
Uh, okay, you're lame, he's
your boyfriend, after all.

14:00.706 --> 14:02.606
No, you're lame.
Your name is Hanky.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.074
Alright,
I'm leaving.

14:04.143 --> 14:05.269
I'll see
you later.

14:05.344 --> 14:07.039
Are you going
to get wasted?

14:07.112 --> 14:11.879
No, I'm going to Pete's house
and drag his lazy ass out of bed.

14:11.951 --> 14:14.715
Don't you dare
miss my pep rally!

14:29.668 --> 14:31.101
Wake up.

14:31.170 --> 14:33.798
Hm. Come here.

14:37.508 --> 14:41.535
<i>Get up. No!
I'm serious. </i>

14:43.215 --> 14:47.413
I'm serious. I'm serious,
dude. Just get up.

14:47.486 --> 14:49.716
You act like there's a
reason for me to get up.

14:52.591 --> 14:56.425
It's a nice
thing to say to me.

14:56.495 --> 14:59.293
Do you not get it?
This is embarrassing.

14:59.365 --> 15:04.200
Just because you're not graduating
today doesn't mean it's forever.

15:04.270 --> 15:06.295
Stop it.

15:06.372 --> 15:10.433
Stop it and get up. I'm begging you
for the millionth morning, please.

15:19.018 --> 15:23.717
<i>Come and help
me pick out a shirt. </i>

15:35.367 --> 15:37.062
Don't.

15:41.674 --> 15:45.542
You know what?
I... I really can't go.

15:45.611 --> 15:49.206
What? I just drove all the way down
here and waited while you got ready.

15:49.281 --> 15:52.375
Whatever. The only reason you
come here is to get me out of bed.

15:52.451 --> 15:54.578
You act like
that's a bad reason.

15:54.653 --> 15:57.213
I just wish it
wasn't the only one.

15:57.289 --> 16:00.781
Oh my God.
You're ridiculous.

16:00.859 --> 16:04.556
Are you coming
with me or not?

16:04.630 --> 16:07.224
Maybe I'll see
you later tonight.

17:09.627 --> 17:13.428
<i>Who-hoo. Stacey
is the girl!</i>

17:25.644 --> 17:26.974
Shot gun!

17:38.190 --> 17:40.249
<i>Pick me up when
you get pot, okay?</i>

17:40.325 --> 17:41.622
Brianne, I have pot.

17:41.693 --> 17:43.923
I thought we were
getting the mushrooms.

17:43.996 --> 17:45.588
I'll see you later.

17:50.502 --> 17:52.197
You did good out there.

17:52.271 --> 17:55.172
<i>Thanks, I wish more than
ten people came, but thanks.</i>

17:55.240 --> 17:58.539
Okay. Where do
we go from here?

17:58.610 --> 17:59.736
Where did Brianne go?

17:59.812 --> 18:01.211
Can you take me home?

18:01.280 --> 18:05.376
What? Summer just started.
I can't believe this.

18:05.451 --> 18:07.817
What? I just have to
change. I'll be right back.

18:07.886 --> 18:09.478
You still have
boring old me, Dawn.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.695
Hey, guys.

18:17.763 --> 18:19.526
The Banks
have mushrooms.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.156
Yeah, Brianne
already told me.

18:21.233 --> 18:22.257
Of course she did.

18:23.702 --> 18:25.602
That was the last
time I shared.

18:25.671 --> 18:28.139
I was so proud of myself
I fucked my brother, man.

18:28.207 --> 18:33.509
I'm serious, fuck him, dude, he's probably
got 20 left and he's the fucking sell.

18:33.579 --> 18:34.637
Hey.

18:34.713 --> 18:37.375
Huh? Hey.
Hey, Mod.

18:37.449 --> 18:39.280
Ah!

18:41.253 --> 18:42.379
What?

18:42.454 --> 18:43.648
Help.

18:43.722 --> 18:44.950
Sorry you had to wait.

18:45.023 --> 18:49.585
Had to handle, uh,
some business. Fuck!

18:49.661 --> 18:53.563
Take care of business.
What business?

18:53.632 --> 18:56.829
That business. You just witnessed
my fucking business. Okay?

18:56.902 --> 18:59.666
<i>For your fucking information,
I sold all my weed.</i>

18:59.738 --> 19:02.002
Did you sell yours?
I don't fucking think so.

19:02.074 --> 19:03.803
You're so
special to me.

19:03.876 --> 19:08.939
Stop touching me and shit, man.
I'm jumpy right now. Just fuck out.

19:09.014 --> 19:11.073
Yeah, I need to
smoke some weed.

19:17.356 --> 19:18.721
So is Dylan downstairs?

19:18.790 --> 19:20.917
Yes.

19:20.993 --> 19:23.120
Yeah, tell that
asshole I said hi.

19:23.195 --> 19:26.028
Bye, guys.

19:55.794 --> 19:57.625
Hey.

19:57.696 --> 20:01.894
Oh, watch this.

20:01.967 --> 20:04.128
<i>Look up.</i>

20:04.203 --> 20:09.004
<i>It took me
all day to do that.</i>

20:09.074 --> 20:11.304
I can't wait to
get drunk tonight.

20:11.376 --> 20:14.470
<i>It's not fair, you know, 
I have to go to school</i>

20:14.546 --> 20:17.640
and you get to sit in here
and do what you want all day.

20:17.716 --> 20:21.152
<i>Tell me again why suspension
is such a bad thing.</i>

20:21.220 --> 20:24.656
Because I sit down here alone
all day waiting for your fine ass.

20:24.723 --> 20:26.213
<i>And I'm starving. </i>

20:26.291 --> 20:29.124
Why don't you just make
yourself a sandwich upstairs?

20:29.194 --> 20:32.357
'Cause I'm lazy and I
knew you'd be home soon.

20:32.431 --> 20:35.525
Dylan.

20:35.601 --> 20:37.967
My mom might
be home any minute.

20:38.036 --> 20:41.767
She ain't never
been a problem before.

20:54.219 --> 20:56.449
You know what
this kid said?

20:56.521 --> 21:00.048
<i>I'm telling you, man, butts are
the new boobs Trust me. I know.</i>

21:00.125 --> 21:03.424
Now that I'm in high school I'm
gonna go get me a nice big Freshman...

21:03.495 --> 21:04.723
Yeah. Freshman.

21:04.796 --> 21:07.856
<i>Hey, Riley, 
what's popping?</i>

21:07.933 --> 21:10.697
<i>You all know Riley?
Riley's a sophomore. </i>

21:10.769 --> 21:14.796
First of all, you sound
like a complete fucking tool.

21:14.873 --> 21:18.104
And second, fuck a
freshman, you know?

21:18.176 --> 21:22.579
Talking about the seniors. So get back
to me on how that butt stiffing goes.

21:22.648 --> 21:27.017
'Cause I'm gonna be busy
punishing that prime ass.

21:27.085 --> 21:28.848
18-year-olds
know what's up, son.

21:28.920 --> 21:30.979
What's up?
Don't touch me.

21:31.056 --> 21:33.718
Riley lost his virginity
when he was like 9 years old.

21:33.792 --> 21:37.421
He's fucked like every girl
in the entire freshman class.

21:37.496 --> 21:39.225
You're damn
right I have.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.732
<i>Hello, kiddies. </i>

21:44.469 --> 21:48.030
Wooo!

21:50.776 --> 21:52.607
<i>Woo-hoo.</i>

21:52.678 --> 21:56.876
Howdy howdy.
Let's get rowdy.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.787
How're you doing?

22:02.854 --> 22:03.946
Alright.

22:04.022 --> 22:06.684
Son of a bitch.

22:07.993 --> 22:10.086
Woo!

22:10.162 --> 22:12.255
Do you wanna get
some beer or what, man?

22:12.331 --> 22:14.799
Whatever. I don't care.

22:14.866 --> 22:16.925
Dude, what is
wrong with you?

22:17.002 --> 22:19.994
I don't know, I failed too many
classes to graduate on time.

22:20.072 --> 22:22.267
And my girlfriend
doesn't like me anymore.

22:22.341 --> 22:23.933
Whatever, man.
Screw it.

22:24.009 --> 22:26.807
None of that shit matters.
I'll tell you what matters.

22:26.878 --> 22:28.209
Beer. Beer matters.

22:28.280 --> 22:30.271
Do me a favor. Stop
trying to cheer me up.

22:30.349 --> 22:32.909
Aw, fuck Julia, dude.

22:32.984 --> 22:34.474
High school girls suck.

22:34.553 --> 22:37.818
College bitches are way
cooler. Trust me, I know this.

22:37.889 --> 22:42.451
Oh, and, um, who here
is going to college?

22:42.527 --> 22:45.462
No, I don't know if I want
to break up with Pete or not.

22:45.530 --> 22:47.498
<i>I mean, after all</i>

22:47.567 --> 22:51.230
is he gonna be around my whole senior
year as the guy that didn't graduate?

22:51.303 --> 22:54.704
<i>But what If I break up with
him and then I want him back?</i>

22:54.773 --> 22:57.765
<i>What I need to do, I need
to hook up with someone else.</i>

22:57.843 --> 22:59.868
That way I can see.

22:59.945 --> 23:03.108
<i>I won't make the break up
decision without knowing for sure.</i>

23:03.181 --> 23:08.016
<i>But I need to think about it
because Pete can't find out.</i>

23:08.086 --> 23:10.987
<i>No. The last thing you wanna
do is be caught up in a secret.</i>

23:11.056 --> 23:14.548
<i>I'm stuck in
this routine. </i>

23:14.626 --> 23:18.153
I try to get my sister to be more
obedient and help out with my parents

23:18.230 --> 23:21.063
I try to get Stacey out of
her abusive relationships

23:21.133 --> 23:23.966
so that she can actually be
happy instead of faking it.

23:24.035 --> 23:26.731
Do you think
Dylan hits Stacey?

23:26.805 --> 23:28.204
I know he's not good.

23:28.273 --> 23:30.366
I'm gonna fucking
kill that kid.

23:30.442 --> 23:33.536
Stacey won't break up with
him unless he cheats on her.

23:33.612 --> 23:36.775
I know exactly who
you should hook up with.

23:43.121 --> 23:44.986
Dylan, I wasn't finished.

23:46.525 --> 23:49.153
That's my
homies. Peace.

23:51.963 --> 23:55.455
<i>Come on, come on, come
on. Bring your yellow ass.</i>

23:57.936 --> 24:00.461
<i>Move, man. I ain't got all day.</i>

24:00.539 --> 24:02.006
I like the back
seat anyway.

24:02.073 --> 24:04.007
Yeah, that's
what I thought.

24:06.978 --> 24:08.104
What's up, son?

24:08.180 --> 24:10.080
There's crank
in this mother.

24:14.719 --> 24:16.516
Hey, what the
hell is that smell?

24:16.588 --> 24:18.249
You smell that?

24:18.323 --> 24:21.724
<i>It smells like what Stacey
wears, that Plumero shit...</i>

24:21.793 --> 24:25.229
No, this is Country Apple, man,
it's nice, I got two bottles.

24:25.297 --> 24:28.027
<i>But Plumero's cool too, I
got some of that at the house.</i>

24:28.099 --> 24:30.932
Eddie, you're
so gay.

24:31.002 --> 24:33.197
Well, I mean, I think
it smells really good.

24:33.271 --> 24:34.932
Just what
I thought.

24:35.006 --> 24:37.668
You're gay. You've
never fucked a bitch.

24:37.742 --> 24:38.902
That's true.

24:38.977 --> 24:41.002
No, man, that's
not true, I have so.

24:41.079 --> 24:44.640
<i>No. Bullshit. The simple fact
is you want that shit so bad.</i>

24:44.716 --> 24:48.447
You end up driving the pussy
away, Now, you take a cat like me,

24:48.520 --> 24:52.718
I did everything I want
'cause I don't want nothing.

24:52.791 --> 24:54.691
Fuck bitches.

24:54.759 --> 24:56.659
Hold on, man, I
ain't saying all that.

24:56.728 --> 24:58.923
Zack, don't even listen
to Biz, he's ugly.

24:58.997 --> 25:00.692
Me and you are
on the same page.

25:00.765 --> 25:02.562
We're on the same
side of the tracks.

25:02.634 --> 25:04.363
You make your own fate.

25:04.436 --> 25:07.428
Now matter how many dudes
shot you down, you'll get one.

25:07.507 --> 25:09.668
You make your fate.

25:09.741 --> 25:12.335
Yeah, man, my fate is
working in my dad's garage.

25:12.410 --> 25:15.038
It's a
great thing.

25:15.113 --> 25:16.307
Yo. Slow down.

25:22.287 --> 25:23.948
What's up?
What's your name?

25:24.022 --> 25:26.957
Holly. Oh my gosh, we just
finished middle school.

25:27.025 --> 25:28.617
Right now.
Right now.

25:28.693 --> 25:32.026
So you guys are officially all
high school freshmen now, huh?

25:32.097 --> 25:33.394
Hell, yeah.

25:33.465 --> 25:35.296
About time.

25:36.636 --> 25:38.570
Man, move it, dip shit.

25:38.637 --> 25:41.105
So, you got a
license, young blood?

25:41.172 --> 25:42.935
<i>No. Why? Are you a cop?</i>

25:43.008 --> 25:45.568
Not yet.

25:46.811 --> 25:50.440
So where
are you 'all goin'?

25:50.515 --> 25:52.073
Wherever you tell us.

25:54.986 --> 25:57.511
What should we say?
And where are we going?

25:57.588 --> 25:59.522
Man, fuck it.
Drive away.

25:59.591 --> 26:02.958
Let's go to Bailey's. They're
practicing for tonight.

26:03.028 --> 26:05.189
Meet us at
Bailey's House.

26:05.263 --> 26:06.560
Alright.

26:06.631 --> 26:08.758
<i>You could even
just follow us there. </i>

26:08.833 --> 26:13.167
Man, what the fu... Bailey don't want
hoes over there when they're rehearsing.

26:13.238 --> 26:15.172
I do. I love hoes.

26:18.076 --> 26:20.636
Big Bailey.
How ya doin' man?

26:20.712 --> 26:22.543
Hey, man.

26:22.614 --> 26:24.206
What's up, man?
Good to see you.

26:24.282 --> 26:27.115
What are you guys doing? Are
you sort of chilling out or...

26:27.185 --> 26:30.120
Hey, hey.
What's up, man?

26:30.188 --> 26:31.621
Hi.

26:31.690 --> 26:34.022
Hey, uh, you guys came
here just to hang out... ?

26:34.092 --> 26:35.753
Yeah.

26:35.827 --> 26:39.786
Cool. We're just practicing. You
can sit on the couch over here.

26:39.864 --> 26:41.195
Alright.

26:41.266 --> 26:43.063
Yeah. To the left.

26:43.134 --> 26:46.228
Are you ready for
some monkey ass?

26:46.304 --> 26:48.295
Yo. Gimme
that. Go.

26:48.373 --> 26:52.036
You know who it is it's
that big boy Biz. Now.

27:05.490 --> 27:07.082
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

27:07.158 --> 27:09.388
<i>Have you ever looked
out to a blue ocean?</i>

27:09.461 --> 27:11.019
Oh, man.

27:11.096 --> 27:14.657
What's happenin', baby?

27:14.733 --> 27:17.634
So, hey, did you
all graduate today?

27:17.702 --> 27:20.671
Fuck,
no. These two did.

27:20.739 --> 27:23.105
<i>I got one more year more
to go. I'm a young bitch.</i>

27:23.174 --> 27:26.541
<i>Are you gonna keep playing
together when you go to college?</i>

27:26.611 --> 27:29.774
We're actually not going to
college. We're punk rockers

27:29.848 --> 27:31.941
So we're just gonna
continue playing.

27:32.017 --> 27:33.951
Yeah. We're just
gonna do that.

27:34.019 --> 27:35.953
Yeah.

27:36.021 --> 27:39.787
That's cool. And your parents
just don't care? It's awesome!

27:39.858 --> 27:42.452
No...

27:42.528 --> 27:48.023
No, fuck, my parents are furious
at me for not applying to college.

27:48.099 --> 27:50.761
This is your
family too, right?

27:50.835 --> 27:53.531
You're choosing us, right,
not... not your parents.

27:53.605 --> 27:56.506
I'm just saying. It's a pretty
risky decision these days

27:56.573 --> 27:58.438
to not apply to
college. That's all.

27:58.510 --> 28:02.344
Regardless, we're gonna, you know,
continue until we have success, right?

28:02.414 --> 28:04.177
I mean, that's
the plan. Right?

28:04.249 --> 28:07.514
Who cares if we're
successful, man?

28:07.586 --> 28:09.952
As long as we're
having a good time.

28:10.021 --> 28:14.924
<i>These good times, right, how are they
gonna continue unless we make money?</i>

28:14.993 --> 28:16.187
Fucking idiot.

28:18.063 --> 28:22.500
He does write all our songs and,
you know, he's a lyrical genius.

28:22.568 --> 28:25.503
<i>So I guess that's why he
doesn't live in reality.</i>

28:25.571 --> 28:30.201
God. Uh! Ah!

28:39.017 --> 28:41.918
Uh...

28:41.986 --> 28:43.419
I like this.

28:43.488 --> 28:44.648
It likes you.

28:44.723 --> 28:48.557
So what are
you doing later?

28:48.625 --> 28:52.356
I... I don't
know. Actually...

28:52.430 --> 28:54.330
Right. Right.
Okay, so.

28:54.399 --> 28:55.764
<i>Time to start.</i>

28:55.834 --> 28:58.894
I'm an idiot. We're
actually playing at a show

28:58.970 --> 29:01.598
um, I'm in this
band, Over It.

29:01.673 --> 29:05.609
Uh, you know... That's alright...
The band's called Over It.

29:05.677 --> 29:08.612
And, see? You can see
it on that drum there.

29:10.616 --> 29:14.882
You should come to the show. I mean,
do you wanna come? Do you wanna come?

29:14.953 --> 29:17.922
Do you guys have plans or
what are you guys doing?

29:17.989 --> 29:20.583
I don't really know.

29:35.507 --> 29:37.270
<i>My first time
babysitting.</i>

29:37.342 --> 29:38.969
Try to act like
a normal person.

29:39.043 --> 29:44.003
Oh, that'll be hard.

29:44.082 --> 29:47.779
Tori, hi, wow,
who's running late?

29:47.852 --> 29:51.515
Please, hurry up and come in
because I need to leave like now.

29:51.588 --> 29:55.217
Hi, mwah. Oh. Come in.
Come in. Come in. Come in.

29:55.293 --> 29:59.252
I am so sorry, Mr. Turner
told me 4:45. Am I really late?

29:59.330 --> 30:03.027
<i>Oh, well, apparently not
in my dear husband's mind.</i>

30:03.101 --> 30:07.231
Hm. So, we should probably
just be a few hours.

30:07.305 --> 30:10.240
Oh my God...
and you!

30:10.308 --> 30:13.539
And your whole Valedictorian
thing and the making us proud.

30:13.612 --> 30:16.274
<i>Oh, God. Congratulations. </i>

30:16.347 --> 30:19.839
Yay! Hm. Bye-bye.

30:22.654 --> 30:24.451
What... ?

30:26.424 --> 30:27.448
Hey!

30:27.526 --> 30:29.255
Hey.

30:29.327 --> 30:32.626
<i>Dude, how many of these
things are there?</i>

30:32.697 --> 30:34.756
There's three children.

30:34.833 --> 30:37.131
<i>This is Reagan, 
and Jenna and Sam. </i>

30:37.202 --> 30:40.535
Hi, little girls,
my name's Sylvia.

30:41.906 --> 30:43.771
God! What the fuck?!

30:43.842 --> 30:46.811
<i>Hey, do not say
those things... </i>

30:46.878 --> 30:48.937
Jesus! You
son of a bitch!

30:49.013 --> 30:50.708
Hey.

30:50.782 --> 30:52.249
Holy Mother of God!

30:52.317 --> 30:53.682
Time for you
to leave, now!

30:53.751 --> 30:56.413
I didn't do
anything. God!

31:07.398 --> 31:11.198
You keep driving,
bitch. You don't know me!

31:11.269 --> 31:12.327
What?

31:28.219 --> 31:30.414
<i>Hi, Mrs. Ford. 
Is Angie here?</i>

31:30.488 --> 31:32.353
Yes.

31:34.893 --> 31:38.659
Um. Do you think that maybe we could
come in and say hi to her real fast?

31:38.730 --> 31:41.631
<i>Is that alright?</i>

31:56.047 --> 31:58.538
Yeah, I was
totally...

32:04.856 --> 32:06.756
<i>You're coming
with us, right Angie?</i>

32:06.824 --> 32:08.815
I'm sorry. Are
you talking to me?

32:08.893 --> 32:10.861
Yeah. You're
coming with us, right?

32:10.929 --> 32:12.487
No fucking way.

32:12.562 --> 32:14.689
<i>No, you have to come
with us. I... I need you.</i>

32:14.766 --> 32:17.530
Okay? I'm gonna hook up with
someone. I'm gonna hook up.

32:17.602 --> 32:19.968
You don't need us.
Just wear your underwear.

32:20.038 --> 32:22.336
Bitch.

32:25.209 --> 32:26.233
Rahhhrr.

32:30.148 --> 32:32.582
<i>So, are your
parents mad</i>

32:32.649 --> 32:34.674
'cause you missed
last day of school?

32:34.752 --> 32:38.313
<i>No, they're trying to get over
last 1000 days she's missed school.</i>

32:38.389 --> 32:41.654
I have A's on all my exams, they
know I'm gonna graduate anyways.

32:41.726 --> 32:44.320
Well, it's called
attendance, smart ass.

32:44.395 --> 32:48.957
<i>Oh my God, please attendance should
be applied on a basis only situation.</i>

32:49.033 --> 32:51.661
I get good grades.
I get perfect grades.

32:51.736 --> 32:53.795
Why does it even
matter if I'm in class?

32:53.871 --> 32:55.566
Don't you wanna
see your friends?

32:55.640 --> 32:57.870
You bitches
all come to me!

32:57.942 --> 33:02.003
Okay, shit head, why don't you go to school
'cause that's the way real life works.

33:02.080 --> 33:03.240
And you're a part of it.

33:03.314 --> 33:04.576
I don't
like real life.

33:04.649 --> 33:06.139
<i>Mrs. Ford
Angie.</i>

33:06.217 --> 33:08.185
What do you want?
Don't come in.

33:08.252 --> 33:11.779
<i>Your father and I are not exactly
happy about you having friends over.</i>

33:11.856 --> 33:14.017
Oh, it's okay. We'll
be gone soon anyway.

33:14.092 --> 33:17.027
<i>Are you planning
on leaving, Angie?</i>

33:22.333 --> 33:24.096
Mom. Does it
really matter?

33:24.168 --> 33:26.602
Of course it matters.

33:26.671 --> 33:29.663
You know your father and I want
to have a serious discussion

33:29.741 --> 33:31.936
about how things
are going to be...

33:32.010 --> 33:34.877
I have friends over right
now. Can't we talk later?

33:34.946 --> 33:39.815
<i>Yes. Look, you were grounded
until we've worked things out.</i>

33:42.020 --> 33:44.420
If I feel like I wanna
go out with my friends

33:44.489 --> 33:48.289
then I'm going to. And if you keep
bugging me about it then I definitely will.

33:48.359 --> 33:53.661
You're only 14 and you
don't even go to school!

33:53.731 --> 33:55.722
You're growing
up too fast.

33:55.800 --> 33:59.600
<i>Compared to the 1700's where children
were forced to work in factories?</i>

33:59.670 --> 34:02.230
<i>Wait. No. You must be
comparing me to the 1970s</i>

34:02.306 --> 34:05.707
when you were a teenager, but weird
because last time that I checked

34:05.777 --> 34:10.043
my generation is less likely to smoke,
drink, do drugs, commit a crime, get pregnant,

34:10.114 --> 34:12.344
or drop out of high
school. God, that's weird

34:12.417 --> 34:15.978
and I don't have time to explain the
gap in between, but peace and love.

34:16.054 --> 34:18.248
<i>How can you... 
I am your mother!</i>

34:18.322 --> 34:19.687
Duh.

34:23.327 --> 34:25.556
So...

34:25.629 --> 34:27.255
<i>Dad?</i>

34:27.331 --> 34:30.197
Is anything wrong?

34:30.268 --> 34:31.292
No.

34:31.369 --> 34:33.063
No.

34:33.137 --> 34:35.331
<i>Dawn and I are picking
up Brianne and Stacey</i>

34:35.406 --> 34:37.966
and then we're probably
gonna go out for the night.

34:38.042 --> 34:39.668
Okay. Love you.

34:39.744 --> 34:42.610
<i>I want you to sleep at
home. And I love you, too.</i>

34:42.679 --> 34:44.705
What?

34:44.782 --> 34:49.617
Dad, no. I've already, like, decided that
I was gonna sleep at Stacey's or wherever.

34:49.687 --> 34:51.985
<i>It's the first
night of summer. </i>

34:52.056 --> 34:54.650
I don't want you guys to
force me to drink and drive.

34:54.725 --> 34:56.989
Then just don't
drink. There you go.

34:57.061 --> 34:59.996
<i>You're not In your bed in the
morning, we've got problems.</i>

35:00.064 --> 35:01.964
You just don't
understand anything.

35:02.033 --> 35:04.968
Right. I'm just trying
to ruin your life.

35:06.704 --> 35:10.003
<i>And Julia, would you
please talk to your sister?</i>

35:10.074 --> 35:14.909
I really need you to stay
home tonight. It's important.

35:14.979 --> 35:16.173
Please.

35:17.348 --> 35:18.975
<i>Love you. </i>

35:22.053 --> 35:23.452
I know...

35:23.521 --> 35:25.148
<i>Excuse me, 
can you knock?</i>

35:25.223 --> 35:27.123
Excuse me, can
you suck my ass?

35:27.191 --> 35:32.254
Julia! What are you even doing in
my room, you stupid bitch, get out!

35:33.965 --> 35:35.899
So, what are
you doing later?

35:35.967 --> 35:39.164
Holly and Lighty have Holly's
mom's car. I might go out with 'em.

35:39.237 --> 35:41.102
Since when did
Holly get a license?

35:41.172 --> 35:44.608
<i>Julia. Shut up!
Do you have any weed?</i>

35:44.675 --> 35:46.666
<i>No. Sorry. </i>

35:46.744 --> 35:50.544
Mom and dad look like they're about
to kill themselves. Stay home tonight.

35:50.616 --> 35:51.947
Are you staying at Pete's?

35:52.016 --> 35:54.917
Would you please
just stay home?

35:54.986 --> 35:58.444
Give me some
weed and maybe I will.

35:58.523 --> 36:01.856
Can we borrow
some weed? Please?

36:01.926 --> 36:04.827
Get us some
later. Come on.

36:04.896 --> 36:06.830
Fine.

36:06.898 --> 36:10.629
You better make sure that we get it
from Mod, not his creepy older brother

36:10.701 --> 36:11.793
or I'll shoot myself.

36:11.869 --> 36:13.564
Why?

36:13.638 --> 36:16.163
<i>He's a pervert and
he's obsessed with me. </i>

36:16.240 --> 36:17.798
And he's really old.

36:17.875 --> 36:19.843
Okay. Sweet.

36:19.911 --> 36:22.277
Alright.
You're dismissed.

36:22.346 --> 36:24.837
Love you.
Good bye.

36:24.916 --> 36:26.474
Bitch.

36:26.551 --> 36:29.486
Oh.

37:00.384 --> 37:04.013
So, what have
you been doing?

37:04.088 --> 37:06.249
Nothing.

37:06.324 --> 37:08.485
Then why did you leave?

37:12.029 --> 37:13.428
What's up?

37:13.497 --> 37:16.125
What's up?

37:17.735 --> 37:19.862
You're headed
to my house?

37:19.937 --> 37:22.303
I'm gonna pick
up your girl.

37:22.373 --> 37:24.204
That's my house.

37:24.275 --> 37:26.539
<i>You ain't paying
no bills.</i>

37:26.611 --> 37:27.669
Ou!

37:27.745 --> 37:29.303
What?

37:29.380 --> 37:33.578
Alright. Well, um

37:33.652 --> 37:34.710
so we gotta go.

37:34.785 --> 37:37.379
Maybe we'll
see you later.

37:37.455 --> 37:39.650
Yeah, maybe.

37:39.724 --> 37:43.455
<i>Wait a second, I'm gonna roll
with them. Gotta get my beak wet.</i>

37:43.527 --> 37:46.121
Alright. I'll off to
the races, son.

37:46.197 --> 37:48.631
Hey, Zack.
Eat this.

37:56.607 --> 37:57.869
What up, kids?

37:57.942 --> 37:59.409
<i>Hi, Eddie.</i>

37:59.477 --> 38:03.208
Julia. What the
hell was that?

38:03.281 --> 38:04.805
What?

38:04.882 --> 38:07.112
<i>Don't give me that.
You and Dylan.</i>

38:07.184 --> 38:09.846
<i>Hello, I have a
boyfriend, actually. </i>

38:09.920 --> 38:13.219
Okay, hello, and so does
your best friend Stacey.

38:14.825 --> 38:16.986
<i>Remember Dylan is
Stacey's boyfriend?</i>

38:17.061 --> 38:22.829
<i>Believe it or not some people
actually do flirt once and a while.</i>

38:22.900 --> 38:26.199
Well, what's that
supposed to mean?

38:26.270 --> 38:28.761
When was the last time
you hooked up with anyone?

38:28.839 --> 38:30.739
Just give me break, man.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.803
<i>Oh, Stacey, Stacey. </i>

38:36.881 --> 38:38.143
Mom, stay there.

38:38.215 --> 38:39.978
Hi, girls! There's
a boy in the car.

38:40.051 --> 38:42.110
<i>Clark Gable,
I could say.</i>

38:42.186 --> 38:45.883
No, mom, you can't say anything
at all, you're an alien.

38:45.956 --> 38:49.084
<i>Oh my God,
how embarrassing.</i>

38:50.961 --> 38:54.021
I think I wanna
hook up with Mod.

38:54.098 --> 38:55.565
Ha!

38:55.634 --> 38:58.102
Are you bastards ready
to get wasted tonight?

38:58.169 --> 38:59.568
Because I am.

38:59.638 --> 39:01.936
My boyfriend just uses
me as a body to bang

39:02.006 --> 39:04.998
and then he just ditches me
right afterwards

39:05.076 --> 39:06.805
Isn't that so funny?

39:06.877 --> 39:10.608
So, anyway, Mod said for us to meet
him at the park to pick up weed.

39:10.681 --> 39:11.739
Hey, Eddie.

39:11.816 --> 39:13.511
Hey.

39:13.584 --> 39:16.246
What's it gonna take
for you to leave him?

39:16.320 --> 39:18.117
What if he was
cheating on you?

39:18.189 --> 39:19.781
Real subtle, Julia.

39:19.857 --> 39:21.256
I'd leave him.

39:21.325 --> 39:23.725
You should check his
pager when he's sleeping.

39:23.794 --> 39:27.252
I haven't found a way or a reason
or an opportunity to leave him yet.

39:27.331 --> 39:29.128
When I do that, I will.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.997
I can think
of many reasons.

39:31.068 --> 39:33.195
Okay. I don't
wanna talk about it.

39:33.270 --> 39:38.230
You know it's a lot harder to leave
someone that it seems. Like you know that.

39:38.309 --> 39:40.004
You know what, Brianne?

39:40.077 --> 39:43.240
Stacey really needs to just
go fuck some really hot ass guy

39:43.314 --> 39:45.839
so Dylan can realize what
he has and appreciate it.

39:45.916 --> 39:48.009
You know what, Dawn?

39:48.085 --> 39:49.416
Go find your hunk...

39:49.487 --> 39:51.250
I'm right here.
I'm right here.

39:51.322 --> 39:53.756
<i>Uh uh, what she should
do is find another guy.</i>

39:53.824 --> 39:55.587
That way she
can make a choice.

39:55.659 --> 39:58.253
<i>You've been dating
Pete for three years</i>

39:58.329 --> 40:01.025
during which you claimed you
haven't even liked the guy.

40:01.098 --> 40:02.725
so I wouldn't
talk if I were you.

40:02.800 --> 40:05.462
Phew, I love girls.

40:05.537 --> 40:06.834
Julia, look out.

40:14.879 --> 40:17.439
<i>I pissed myself.</i>

40:17.515 --> 40:20.143
<i>God, Eddie,
it's disgusting.</i>

40:20.217 --> 40:22.208
Okay, no thanks.

40:22.286 --> 40:24.220
Yeah, I think
I'll pass.

40:24.288 --> 40:27.780
Oh, no.

40:27.858 --> 40:30.452
Oh, my
goodness. Hi.

40:30.528 --> 40:31.927
Hi.

40:31.996 --> 40:33.361
<i>Yoo- hoo!</i>

40:34.965 --> 40:36.796
She's completely
destroyed.

40:39.470 --> 40:41.938
So what have you
guys been doing?

40:42.006 --> 40:43.530
Ah!

40:45.276 --> 40:47.506
Why don't we go
to the back yard?

40:47.578 --> 40:49.978
Hey, can I um,
use your bathroom?

40:50.047 --> 40:52.208
Yeah. Of course,
it's down the hall.

40:52.283 --> 40:56.014
Come on.

41:32.490 --> 41:33.548
What...

41:39.196 --> 41:42.996
What is that whole Mod
thing about you, asshole?

41:43.067 --> 41:46.002
People are starting
to get suspicious, man.

41:46.070 --> 41:48.595
Did you hear what Julia
said earlier in the car?

41:48.672 --> 41:50.833
I think she started
to suspect something.

41:50.908 --> 41:54.810
You're so fucking paranoid. We've
kept it all a secret for this long.

41:54.879 --> 41:58.781
I am so tired
of living in secret.

41:58.849 --> 42:01.716
I can't even keep my
head on straight right now.

42:01.785 --> 42:05.186
I'm the one who said we should
tell people if we wanted to.

42:05.256 --> 42:09.659
Shh. Shut up.
Just shut up.

42:09.727 --> 42:15.029
God, you know damn well why I don't
want anybody to know about this shit.

42:15.099 --> 42:19.468
You just don't
fucking get it.

42:32.316 --> 42:36.343
<i>I can't actually remember when
spinning on a tire was so thrilling.</i>

42:36.420 --> 42:38.615
How old were we when
we first started drugs?

42:38.689 --> 42:41.249
<i>Can we not say the
D-R-U-G-S right now?</i>

42:41.325 --> 42:42.917
I really want
to get wasted.

42:42.993 --> 42:45.860
<i>Oh my God.</i>

42:45.930 --> 42:48.990
<i>Where did you
get the shrooms?</i>

42:49.066 --> 42:50.795
What's going on?

42:50.868 --> 42:54.964
Hey. We are babysitting young
children right now. Have you gone mad?

42:55.039 --> 42:57.303
No, but I'm about to.

42:57.374 --> 43:00.639
<i>Hello? We were supposed to
do them together, remember?</i>

43:00.711 --> 43:02.508
You still have
yours. Eat 'em!

43:02.579 --> 43:04.342
<i>I'll eat 'em.</i>

43:04.415 --> 43:05.939
I think I might
want them.

43:06.016 --> 43:08.007
<i>You'd better
eat then now.</i>

43:08.085 --> 43:11.486
If you don't eat them,
you're gonna be tripping.

43:11.555 --> 43:12.647
<i>All night.</i>

43:16.226 --> 43:18.786
<i>All by yourself.
All alone.</i>

43:18.862 --> 43:20.853
<i>Well, If I take
them right now,</i>

43:20.931 --> 43:23.365
how long is it gonna
take for them to kick in?

43:23.434 --> 43:25.163
<i>Are you kidding?</i>

43:25.235 --> 43:27.032
You've never
done shrooms before?

43:27.104 --> 43:29.698
<i>No, I haven't I figured
I may as well try them</i>

43:29.773 --> 43:31.866
with my best friends.
It's my graduation.

43:31.942 --> 43:34.274
I will take them if
you don't want them.

43:34.345 --> 43:39.373
<i>Come on, Tori. Just do it. For the
first time In your life be irresponsible.</i>

43:39.450 --> 43:40.508
Do it.

<i>Hey, you all. I'm gonna get picked up to
go to this kid's house, it's a big party.</i>

Riley. I'll meet you kids there.

44:07.678 --> 44:09.407
Why don't you roll with us?

44:09.480 --> 44:12.643
Nosy. Riley and I gotta

<i>Talk to me, wassup?</i>

45:21.552 --> 45:23.179
Why are you
rushing for it?

45:23.253 --> 45:27.917
When I'm talking to one of these
older chicks, what do I say?

45:27.991 --> 45:29.583
Oh, you don't
know what to say...

45:29.660 --> 45:32.185
Uh, give us a second.

45:32.262 --> 45:37.529
Senior girls are a little bit smarter so
if you wanna tap that older ass tonight

45:37.600 --> 45:39.568
you gotta listen
to my rules, alright?

45:39.635 --> 45:45.130
First, give
'em the look.

45:45.209 --> 45:47.370
Yeah. Yeah.
Be smooth, alright?

45:47.444 --> 45:49.469
Listen first.
Make moves later.

45:49.545 --> 45:52.571
Let 'em know you're for real.
Take control of the situation.

45:52.649 --> 45:55.049
And be a little arrogant.
Girls love that shit.

45:55.119 --> 45:59.055
Use some smooth little
one-liners. Um, like, uh...

46:00.958 --> 46:04.291
Hey, sweet milk,
Holla at your boy.

46:04.361 --> 46:06.386
Something like that.

46:06.463 --> 46:08.863
<i>Okay. Holla at your
boy, sweet milk.</i>

46:08.932 --> 46:12.026
Ah! You got this

Brianne.

46:36.126 --> 46:37.218
Surprise!

46:37.294 --> 46:38.318
Shit.

46:38.395 --> 46:39.726
You wanna dance?

46:39.797 --> 46:41.094
Uh. No.

46:41.165 --> 46:44.396
Oh. Do you believe
in love at first sight?

46:44.468 --> 46:47.733
This whole thing. I know,
I'm sorry, you've heard it.

46:47.805 --> 46:49.363
<i>Damn it.</i>

46:49.439 --> 46:50.497
Bucket!

46:50.575 --> 46:52.167
Aw, shit!

46:52.242 --> 46:55.109
Yes, sir. You'd better
finish that drink, bitch.

46:55.179 --> 46:57.374
There are children
sober in India.

46:57.447 --> 46:59.142
Mm. Ah!

46:59.216 --> 47:01.878
That's a good boy! That
one was for the kids.

47:01.952 --> 47:04.182
Beer and me,
friends for life. Ah!

47:04.254 --> 47:08.486
Aw, shit. Pete's doing that
thing that makes him fart again.

47:08.559 --> 47:10.925
<i>Hey, Pete, hold
on one second. </i>

47:14.531 --> 47:16.829
Everybody in.
Come on, come on.

47:16.900 --> 47:20.063
Alright. Ready?
Set? Go, bro.

47:24.007 --> 47:26.339
<i>That's my
friend, right there.</i>

47:26.410 --> 47:27.877
You didn't tell
me anything.

47:27.945 --> 47:30.175
Why are you being
so fucking annoying?

47:30.247 --> 47:34.377
I need to
talk to you.

47:34.451 --> 47:36.476
<i>Hey, asshole!</i>

47:37.653 --> 47:40.451
You're the
shit, bro. Yeah!

47:42.292 --> 47:45.318
<i>We're out of toilet paper.</i>

47:45.395 --> 47:49.957
<i>Can somebody help me?
I need toilet paper!</i>

47:51.501 --> 47:53.059
So what have
you been doing?

47:53.136 --> 47:56.970
Don't worry
about it. Damn.

47:57.040 --> 48:00.771
I don't think I should
be treated like this.

48:00.844 --> 48:03.574
<i>You'd better start acting
like I'm your girlfriend.</i>

48:03.646 --> 48:05.614
And not just some
girl you come home to.

48:14.191 --> 48:15.681
Who sent you this?

48:15.759 --> 48:17.989
How the hell would
I know, you got it.

48:18.061 --> 48:20.825
Apparently someone wants
to know if you want to fuck.

48:20.898 --> 48:23.628
Shut up, it don't
say that. Fu...

48:23.701 --> 48:24.725
<i>Brianne!</i>

48:24.801 --> 48:25.927
I hate you.

48:26.003 --> 48:27.527
I love you.

48:29.706 --> 48:34.734
<i>Oh, Have you guys seen Brianne? I've
not seen her once since we came In.</i>

48:34.811 --> 48:36.540
Excuse me.

48:36.613 --> 48:39.844
I'm gonna go find someone who's
mature and who likes me for me.

48:39.917 --> 48:43.546
And not just for my house
and my turkey sandwiches.

48:43.619 --> 48:46.850
And my flower.

49:06.043 --> 49:08.238
I fucked that
chick like two weeks ago.

49:08.312 --> 49:09.802
That's Dylan's girlfriend.

49:09.880 --> 49:11.677
Must've been
somebody else then.

49:11.748 --> 49:17.084
<i>Class of 199-fucking-9.</i>

49:17.154 --> 49:19.645
<i>Man this is
lame, '99, '93.</i>

49:19.723 --> 49:22.248
What's the shit,
I mean, it's crazy.

49:22.326 --> 49:25.693
Spinning crazy. Crazy,
crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy.

49:25.762 --> 49:27.593
So what does that mean?

49:27.663 --> 49:31.224
<i>Graduation day, right? So after
we broke a few school windows</i>

49:31.301 --> 49:33.792
and tied up Professor
Fuck-My-Face's car

49:33.870 --> 49:35.861
<i>I was In my place
to smoke a jay, right?</i>

49:35.939 --> 49:38.737
Then Jamie comes over,
and she comes over,

49:38.809 --> 49:41.073
but I'm trying to
bang her all year.

49:41.144 --> 49:43.009
And she comes over
and she's balling.

49:43.080 --> 49:46.106
<i>And she even tells me couple of
days about this friend of hers</i>

49:46.183 --> 49:50.142
uh, uh, Allie,
who was a Russian spy

49:50.220 --> 49:53.485
<i>Okay, and like, you know,
ding-dong, a little bell running.</i>

49:53.557 --> 49:56.219
next thing you know Allie
pulls out a Smith and Wesson

49:56.293 --> 49:58.523
and starts waving
around speaking Russian.

49:59.763 --> 50:02.527
I grab, uh, I got
my lucky knife.

50:02.599 --> 50:04.897
<i>I got my fucking knife
I'm gonna do something. </i>

50:04.968 --> 50:08.233
I was gonna do something
but I don't have to.

50:08.305 --> 50:10.796
Get me what he's
smoking.

50:10.874 --> 50:14.605
Smoke. Drink.
Don't think.

50:14.678 --> 50:17.476
Hey, douchebag.
Eat me.

50:19.383 --> 50:22.716
<i>Uh. Yo smoking grass</i>

50:22.786 --> 50:26.745
gives a little laugh, we want
your ass 'cause I'm about to blast.

50:26.823 --> 50:30.384
And I'm about to have a good
time. Grab some titties and ass.

50:30.460 --> 50:33.918
<i>It's all on the same run. Everybody
knows what's coming outta my mind.</i>

50:33.997 --> 50:36.864
<i>But I breathe so fast
I can't leave these words. </i>

50:36.933 --> 50:39.902
<i>Trees, trees, I smoke
trees, I roll weed</i>

51:08.065 --> 51:09.828
Hey, sweet milk

51:09.900 --> 51:11.299
What?

51:11.368 --> 51:13.632
What?

51:19.509 --> 51:21.500
I'm Riley.

51:21.578 --> 51:24.638
I'm sorry.
I'm such a mess.

51:24.715 --> 51:26.910
Oh.

51:34.091 --> 51:37.060
Beer.

51:44.635 --> 51:47.934
<i>That's all I wanted. </i>

51:48.004 --> 51:49.733
I just became a senior.

51:51.475 --> 51:55.138
And I just can't keep on
living my life like this

51:55.212 --> 51:57.476
and still have respect
for myself, you know?

51:57.547 --> 52:00.880
<i>I wake up
every single morning</i>

52:00.951 --> 52:04.944
and I tell myself that
today's gonna be different

52:05.021 --> 52:08.889
I'm not gonna be
mistreated by, like,

52:08.959 --> 52:11.189
anyone.

52:12.863 --> 52:16.162
And then I go through
my day and I come home

52:16.233 --> 52:18.895
and everything
starts right back

52:18.969 --> 52:21.460
where it left off.

52:21.538 --> 52:24.063
I think you should
come home with me.

52:31.181 --> 52:33.081
Hey, guys. Hi.

52:33.150 --> 52:36.586
Hey, thanks for inviting me to smoke
with you. It's great. It's nice.

52:36.653 --> 52:37.677
Hi, Brianne.

52:37.754 --> 52:39.551
Hi, Dawn.

52:39.623 --> 52:42.456
<i>I called your name.
'cause I wasn't gonna smoke.</i>

52:42.526 --> 52:45.654
There's a lot of smoke and I've
always got it, so, stick with me.

52:45.729 --> 52:47.526
Thanks, but I'd
rather kill myself.

52:47.597 --> 52:49.292
Oh.

52:49.366 --> 52:54.497
You're just... Do you know how I
feel about you? You're so feisty.

52:54.571 --> 52:57.506
Hey, Brianne. Here's that
tampon that you really needed.

52:57.573 --> 53:00.565
Remember? Can I talk to
you alone for one second?

53:02.112 --> 53:04.046
<i>Hey, Zack, I have
your tampon.</i>

53:04.114 --> 53:05.672
That's nasty.

53:05.749 --> 53:08.343
I thought that whole you
and Mod was just bullshit.

53:08.418 --> 53:12.684
Dawn, you've been my best friend
for like a gazillion years.

53:12.757 --> 53:15.225
<i>But this has got too
way out of control. </i>

53:15.292 --> 53:16.919
It drives me crazy

53:16.993 --> 53:20.224
when you flirt with Mod right
in front of my face, you asshole.

53:20.297 --> 53:22.663
I was just
smoking a blunt.

53:22.732 --> 53:26.031
I saw what you
were doing.

53:26.102 --> 53:28.593
Let's just all have
a good night, okay?

55:45.775 --> 55:48.437
<i>Come on.</i>

55:48.510 --> 55:51.104
<i>Fuck it, the light.</i>

55:51.181 --> 55:53.945
<i>Ah I Fuck.</i>

55:58.888 --> 56:02.722
Um, uh, What... What the
hell is the matter with you?

56:02.792 --> 56:04.919
Put this on. What's wrong with you?

56:04.994 --> 56:08.953
Is that the way you wanna flash those
perverts? You didn't even get to know 'em.

56:09.032 --> 56:10.260
Young, how
old are you?

56:10.333 --> 56:12.460
I'm old enough.

56:12.536 --> 56:16.097
Old enough for what? What
are you trying to prove?

56:16.172 --> 56:19.573
<i>Don't get caught up being so hot
you forget to be a real person.</i>

56:19.642 --> 56:21.075
You think I'm hot?

56:22.946 --> 56:25.176
<i>Come on, you said
you love young girls.</i>

56:25.248 --> 56:28.615
I care about younger girls but
don't believe what I say to the guys.

56:28.685 --> 56:29.743
What?

56:33.689 --> 56:37.056
Uh, hey, hey, I'm gonna be
famous some day, You know that?

56:37.127 --> 56:40.528
Hey, some people are just born for
stardom and I'm just one of them.

56:40.597 --> 56:44.863
<i>What can I say?
My charm's a felony.</i>

56:44.934 --> 56:46.834

57:12.796 --> 57:14.593
Now why don't you
like your brother?

57:14.664 --> 57:17.531
Because his brother is
a pedophile, I'm convinced.

57:17.600 --> 57:18.862
<i>He'll bitch at me...</i>

57:18.935 --> 57:22.063
Alright. Roll

57:44.461 --> 57:45.826
Yup. It is cool.

57:47.430 --> 57:50.263
You know what? We need to
do some more illegal shit.

57:50.333 --> 57:52.426
We need to hit the
trash cans right here.

57:52.502 --> 57:53.560
Yeah.

57:53.635 --> 57:55.296
Like with my car?

57:55.371 --> 57:57.862
Like with your
car, man! Go, man.

57:57.941 --> 57:59.272
Yeah, hit that one.

57:59.342 --> 58:00.502
<i>Just do it.</i>

58:00.578 --> 58:01.806
<i>Come on!</i>

58:01.878 --> 58:02.902
<i>You can do it!</i>

58:07.750 --> 58:09.615
Are you frigging serious?

58:09.686 --> 58:12.655
My dick goes faster than your
car. Will you hit a trash can?

58:14.724 --> 58:16.624
<i>He's gonna do it!</i>

58:24.767 --> 58:26.928
Hey, go back, go back.

58:27.003 --> 58:28.766
Let's go to
Stacey's mom's house.

58:28.838 --> 58:30.567
<i>Zack, you're
still a bitch.</i>

58:30.640 --> 58:33.108
<i>Go bitches, yeah.
Come on I</i>

58:33.176 --> 58:34.837
<i>Get the shit.</i>

58:34.911 --> 58:37.744
<i>Let's do it, let's go.
Yo, move your fat ass.</i>

58:37.814 --> 58:39.008
Ah!

58:39.082 --> 58:41.516
Move your ass!

58:44.721 --> 58:47.713
<i>Get back In now.</i>

58:50.260 --> 58:51.352
<i>Roll the car!</i>

58:51.427 --> 58:52.394
<i>Go! Go!</i>

58:58.835 --> 58:59.961
<i>Go, go, go, man.</i>

59:00.036 --> 59:01.435
<i>Hurry up. Hurry up.</i>

59:01.504 --> 59:03.165
Holy shit

59:03.239 --> 59:05.036
Yeah!

59:05.108 --> 59:06.905
<i>Come on, come on, come on.</i>

59:06.976 --> 59:09.342
<i>Get out of here.</i>

59:09.412 --> 59:10.470
<i>Yeah!</i>

59:12.181 --> 59:16.914
What in God's
name was that?

59:16.986 --> 59:20.478
I'm sure it's just
good friends of ours.

59:20.557 --> 59:24.288
Vandalizing, probably.

59:30.400 --> 59:33.528
Oh, yeah.

59:33.603 --> 59:39.667
Oh my Jesus, you just
gave me the best idea ever.

59:39.742 --> 59:42.040
Oh, God.

59:42.111 --> 59:46.810
Get ready,
for awesome.

01:00:14.978 --> 01:00:17.003
Sylvia.

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:19.844
Do you think this music might
wake all the kids back up?

01:00:19.916 --> 01:00:22.749
Wait. I have to know this.

01:00:22.819 --> 01:00:27.449
<i>Did the movie The Matrix
actually come out of reality</i>

01:00:27.522 --> 01:00:30.889
or did I just make that
whole thing up in my head?

01:00:33.329 --> 01:00:36.787
Dude, I don't know, I just can't
stop thinking about pink lemonade.

01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:42.360
Sylvia.

01:00:42.438 --> 01:00:43.370
What?

01:00:43.439 --> 01:00:46.101
Let's talk to each other.

01:00:46.175 --> 01:00:48.336
Here I come.

01:00:48.411 --> 01:00:51.847
Okay.

01:00:51.914 --> 01:00:57.113
Here I am.

01:00:57.186 --> 01:01:00.280
I'm scared to leave home.

01:01:00.356 --> 01:01:03.553
There's no such thing as
home. It's all just an idea.

01:01:03.626 --> 01:01:05.753
I promise.

01:01:05.828 --> 01:01:08.319
You know
what I mean.

01:01:08.398 --> 01:01:10.389
Like,

01:01:10.466 --> 01:01:14.527
the comfort and familiarity of
what home is to me right now.

01:01:14.604 --> 01:01:17.095
<i>This home that
you think is home</i>

01:01:17.173 --> 01:01:19.971
is really just
the first one.

01:01:20.043 --> 01:01:22.273
<i>It's like we
have this family</i>

01:01:22.345 --> 01:01:24.836
and we go off
and we do stuff

01:01:24.914 --> 01:01:28.941
and eventually we start
ourselves a new family

01:01:29.018 --> 01:01:33.978
<i>and then our family will go
off and start more families.</i>

01:01:34.057 --> 01:01:38.619
And really it's just like
this whole chain reaction

01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:41.027
of, like, creation

01:01:41.097 --> 01:01:44.225
<i>and we try to
classify it In stages</i>

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:47.997
so that we can find
comfort in where we're at.

01:01:48.071 --> 01:01:51.939
At that one particular
moment in time.

01:01:52.008 --> 01:01:53.737
<i>And really, </i>

01:01:53.810 --> 01:01:56.301
there's no
such thing as time.

01:01:56.379 --> 01:02:01.976
And we're all just
walking, talking patterns.

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.147
Shh!

01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:07.689
I heard that, too.

01:02:07.756 --> 01:02:10.281
This place is a wreck.

01:02:10.359 --> 01:02:11.758
Should I go down there?

01:02:11.828 --> 01:02:12.852
No.

01:02:12.929 --> 01:02:14.021
It's all wet.

01:02:14.097 --> 01:02:15.428
What should I do?

01:02:15.498 --> 01:02:18.990
I'll soak it clean, so
you clean up real fast.

01:02:19.068 --> 01:02:22.299
And, I will
distract them.

01:02:22.371 --> 01:02:25.602
And then
Tom, when he...

01:02:25.675 --> 01:02:28.838
<i>Hello, hellooooooo. </i>

01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:31.038
Wooooooo.

01:02:32.614 --> 01:02:36.015
Wow, it is all so wonderful
to finally meet you.

01:02:37.854 --> 01:02:39.116
Oh.

01:02:39.188 --> 01:02:41.349
Mwah, mwah.

01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:42.891
Oh! Yeah.

01:02:42.959 --> 01:02:45.894
Are the, uh,
children not sleeping?

01:02:45.962 --> 01:02:48.430
Oh, they most
certainly are!

01:02:48.498 --> 01:02:51.023
Yes, they are!
They love sleeping!

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:52.931
<i>They told me sol</i>

01:02:53.002 --> 01:02:55.869
<i>They said, 
"I love sleeping. "</i>

01:02:55.938 --> 01:02:57.963
Sleep, sleep, sleep.

01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:59.974
<i>I want to sleep. </i>

01:03:00.042 --> 01:03:01.771
Wow.

01:03:01.844 --> 01:03:05.871
You smell legendary,
by the way.

01:03:05.948 --> 01:03:08.917
What's this
music I'm hearing?

01:03:11.387 --> 01:03:14.288
So, anyways, um... !

01:03:14.357 --> 01:03:18.817
That was actually my
first time babysitting.

01:03:18.895 --> 01:03:20.760
<i>You know kids. </i>

01:03:20.830 --> 01:03:26.063
<i>And, um, I just wanna say that
I think it was like 9:00 o'clock</i>

01:03:26.135 --> 01:03:27.500
Yeah.

01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:29.470
<i>And I all of a sudden got this urge</i>

01:03:29.539 --> 01:03:32.599
to just go murder
the kiddies, right?

01:03:32.675 --> 01:03:35.166
<i>So believe it or not, </i>

01:03:35.244 --> 01:03:38.543
I actually had to grip
the sides of your sofa

01:03:38.614 --> 01:03:40.809
to keep me from
running into the kitchen

01:03:40.883 --> 01:03:43.579
and grabbing a butcher
knife and just stabbing them

01:03:43.653 --> 01:03:45.484
Mr. and Mrs. Turner.

01:03:45.555 --> 01:03:47.455
<i>Mister and Mister.</i>

01:03:47.523 --> 01:03:50.981
<i>She's my friend Sylvia and I'm so
sorry you had to meet her. But...</i>

01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:52.118
I'm Sylvia.

01:03:54.263 --> 01:03:57.596
<i>Everything's good and
wonderful. We gotta go. Good bye.</i>

01:03:57.666 --> 01:03:59.327
Oh, we're
leaving. Oh, yeah.

01:04:10.746 --> 01:04:11.872
Oh.

01:04:11.948 --> 01:04:12.972
What?

01:04:13.049 --> 01:04:14.573
<i>I don't know. </i>

01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:19.349
Maybe these are really strong
shrooms or something, but...

01:04:19.422 --> 01:04:22.755
I think there's a
goose back there.

01:04:22.825 --> 01:04:24.315
Oh.

01:04:31.901 --> 01:04:33.562
You wanna go to
that punk show?

01:04:35.338 --> 01:04:37.898
<i>I want you
to understand.</i>

01:04:37.974 --> 01:04:39.771
<i>Fucked. Fucked.</i>

01:04:39.842 --> 01:04:42.436
<i>You left me. 
Do you understand?</i>

01:04:42.511 --> 01:04:46.106
I'm not happy. I
drove around 40 blocks.

01:04:46.182 --> 01:04:48.309
<i>Okay? 40 blocks.</i>

01:04:48.384 --> 01:04:50.579
<i>Come on, man.</i>

01:04:50.654 --> 01:04:52.713
Hey.

01:04:52.788 --> 01:04:55.154
Damn, we missed
the whole show?

01:04:55.224 --> 01:04:57.283
I wish I had
your timing.

01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:58.725
It sucked?

01:04:58.794 --> 01:05:00.284
No.

01:05:00.363 --> 01:05:01.591
It was
really good.

01:05:01.664 --> 01:05:03.632
Everybody, that
was awesome.

01:05:03.699 --> 01:05:06.930
Fucking great
that shit, man.

01:05:07.003 --> 01:05:08.800
You rock, man.

01:05:08.871 --> 01:05:11.465
<i>Hey, uh, did you bring
your friend Lighty?</i>

01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:13.599
Hey, light this.

01:05:13.675 --> 01:05:15.506
<i>What's up, you sliding?</i>

01:05:15.578 --> 01:05:17.443
I'm sliding,
mother fucker.

01:05:19.315 --> 01:05:20.805
Guys, guys.

01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:22.911
There's a keg party.

01:05:22.985 --> 01:05:24.247
Yes!

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:26.311
Thank God. I'm so
out of my damn mind.

01:05:26.389 --> 01:05:29.051
This place would
need some, actually.

01:05:29.125 --> 01:05:31.616
I got something for you.

01:05:31.694 --> 01:05:33.787
Oh, can you drive
me by my house later?

01:05:33.863 --> 01:05:36.127
<i>Sausage fest. </i>

01:05:36.198 --> 01:05:37.529
What's up, bitch?

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:38.658
Hoe.

01:05:38.734 --> 01:05:40.395
Yo, bitch
what's up?

01:05:40.469 --> 01:05:42.596
Hey, what do you want?

01:05:42.672 --> 01:05:45.072
What, daddy? Staring
like there's a problem.

01:05:45.141 --> 01:05:46.836
You're full of it.

01:05:46.909 --> 01:05:48.308
<i>You ain't rough, man.</i>

01:05:48.377 --> 01:05:50.174
What are they
fighting about?

01:05:50.246 --> 01:05:53.340
So lame. What are they ever
fighting about? It's so stupid.

01:05:53.416 --> 01:05:55.316
What the fuck
are you looking at?

01:05:55.384 --> 01:05:56.817
<i>Go fuck yourself. </i>

01:05:56.886 --> 01:05:58.410
<i>Go fuck myself?
You know what?</i>

01:05:58.487 --> 01:06:01.183
I will do that. After I fuck
your sister and your momma.

01:06:01.257 --> 01:06:02.417
At least we got mommas.

01:06:02.491 --> 01:06:04.356
Hey, hey, wait.

01:06:04.427 --> 01:06:06.395
<i>Not here, 
man. Chill out. </i>

01:06:06.462 --> 01:06:07.554
Bye, bitches.

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:08.790
<i>We got spice.</i>

01:06:08.864 --> 01:06:10.354
<i>We'll be there.</i>

01:06:10.433 --> 01:06:12.094
What the fuck?
Ain't got my back?

01:06:12.168 --> 01:06:14.966
Wh... What, I was, I...
I... was right here. What?

01:06:15.037 --> 01:06:18.006
<i>We got these
mother fuckers.</i>

01:06:18.074 --> 01:06:20.235
Sa...

01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:21.936
<i>No, no, no. Hey.</i>

01:06:22.011 --> 01:06:24.980
Hey, hey, man,
Do me a favor, Thomas.

01:06:25.047 --> 01:06:27.538
Can you please send
young girl to get Bailey?

01:06:27.616 --> 01:06:28.480
What?

01:06:28.551 --> 01:06:29.540
Shut up.

01:06:29.618 --> 01:06:32.587
Be brave.
He's nice, okay?

01:06:32.655 --> 01:06:35.089
You're in the gang.

01:06:42.732 --> 01:06:44.199
Hey.

01:06:44.266 --> 01:06:45.597
Oh, hey.

01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:47.727
Hi.

01:06:47.802 --> 01:06:51.363
Um, you guys
were really good.

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:52.668
It was awesome.

01:06:52.742 --> 01:06:54.107
Thanks for coming.

01:06:54.176 --> 01:06:57.612
I was glad that you
came, I appreciate that.

01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:00.615
We sounded like shit.

01:07:00.683 --> 01:07:04.244
I couldn't hear myself,
it was fucked up.

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:06.345
Ridiculous.
We sounded like garbage.

01:07:06.422 --> 01:07:09.016
Horrible.

01:07:09.091 --> 01:07:13.687
Uh. Well, there's
this keg party tonight.

01:07:13.763 --> 01:07:15.663
Yeah.

01:07:15.730 --> 01:07:19.666
Um, you
should really come.

01:07:19.735 --> 01:07:21.259
I don't know.

01:07:21.337 --> 01:07:24.397
Like, big parties are
not really my scene.

01:07:24.473 --> 01:07:26.236
You know, it's like...

01:07:26.308 --> 01:07:29.505
And I gotta get up early and
take the van to the shop so

01:07:29.578 --> 01:07:32.172
I probably shouldn't stay
up that late, you know?

01:07:32.248 --> 01:07:37.948
Take the van to the shop?
Oh, man.

01:07:50.866 --> 01:07:52.993
<i>Ready to smoke
some week kids?</i>

01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:54.627
Blah!

01:07:54.703 --> 01:07:56.500
<i>I've never used one
of those before.</i>

01:07:56.572 --> 01:07:58.767
Just take this
and pull through that.

01:07:58.841 --> 01:08:00.206
Pull and suck, baby.

01:08:00.276 --> 01:08:02.870
<i>Shut up!
God.</i>

01:08:02.945 --> 01:08:06.472
Ready? Your's ready? We got
to all pull at the same time.

01:08:19.361 --> 01:08:21.453
So why don't
you like big parties?

01:08:21.529 --> 01:08:22.656
Why don't you?

01:08:22.731 --> 01:08:24.288
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:08:24.366 --> 01:08:28.962
Oh, I guess, um, I don't
really like drinking that much.

01:08:29.037 --> 01:08:30.733
Fag.

01:08:30.805 --> 01:08:32.899
<i>It's always the same
thing, you go, drink,</i>

01:08:32.975 --> 01:08:35.636
you, you know, you stay
around with the same people

01:08:35.711 --> 01:08:39.238
and then you do the same crap, you
know, and you go home to go to sleep.

01:08:39.314 --> 01:08:40.407
Na-na.

01:08:40.483 --> 01:08:42.279
All the
meaningless conversation

01:08:42.350 --> 01:08:44.080
<i>Yeah, man. </i>

01:08:44.153 --> 01:08:46.781
Meaningless conversations
may not be that bad.

01:08:46.856 --> 01:08:50.758
<i>I graduated today and I never
talked to anyone In four years.</i>

01:08:50.826 --> 01:08:52.850
And I'm a little sad.

01:08:54.930 --> 01:08:56.761
That's so
depressing, dude.

01:08:56.832 --> 01:08:58.662
Where does
he come from?

01:08:58.734 --> 01:09:00.361
Jesus!

01:09:00.435 --> 01:09:02.529
That was ridiculous.

01:09:02.604 --> 01:09:06.041
A picture is worth
like a thousand words.

01:09:06.108 --> 01:09:12.104
<i>That means he's talked with
probably, like, a million people.</i>

01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:14.843
<i>No! Barf on
your ass! No!</i>

01:09:14.917 --> 01:09:15.941
I liked that.

01:09:16.018 --> 01:09:18.919
God damn
right you did.

01:09:18.988 --> 01:09:21.479
Hey, I don't usually
say much either.

01:09:21.557 --> 01:09:23.649
<i>Everybody thinks, 
I'm like, this airhead</i>

01:09:23.725 --> 01:09:26.286
but really, I just,

01:09:26.362 --> 01:09:30.059
don't feel the need to talk unless
I have something meaningful to say.

01:09:30.131 --> 01:09:32.895
<i>Oh, gag me
with a dick!</i>

01:09:32.968 --> 01:09:36.596
I'm really sorry,
I can't stop him.

01:09:36.671 --> 01:09:40.129
<i>You know what?
Fuck off, we're here. </i>

01:09:40.209 --> 01:09:43.736
Leave my van now.
Get the fuck out.

01:09:43.812 --> 01:09:45.676
<i>It's your party. go.</i>

01:09:45.747 --> 01:09:48.979
<i>I gotta take care of some business.
He's going with you, right?</i>

01:09:49.051 --> 01:09:50.518
<i>Hey, yeah.</i>

01:09:50.586 --> 01:09:52.645
<i>You enjoy
your little party.</i>

01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:55.451
<i>We're gonna get some
cigarettes for you, Nancy pants.</i>

01:09:55.524 --> 01:09:56.650
Get me cigarettes.

01:09:56.725 --> 01:09:58.920
We'll be right back. Shit. Shit.

01:09:58.994 --> 01:10:00.018
<i>Ah!</i>

01:10:00.095 --> 01:10:01.187
<i>Fuck, man!</i>

01:10:01.263 --> 01:10:03.697
Yo, slam that
door hard, alright?

01:10:03.765 --> 01:10:05.596
Alright, ready?

01:10:05.668 --> 01:10:07.727
That is a piece.

01:10:13.876 --> 01:10:15.605
Dylan!

01:10:15.677 --> 01:10:18.202
Dylan!

01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:22.915
<i>Dylan. </i>

01:10:26.088 --> 01:10:27.988
Hey.

01:10:32.094 --> 01:10:33.891
Get off!

01:10:33.963 --> 01:10:35.396
Want some?

01:10:35.464 --> 01:10:36.829
I would love some.

01:10:39.368 --> 01:10:42.303
Howdy, howdy.

01:10:46.108 --> 01:10:47.973
Beer!

01:10:48.043 --> 01:10:49.874
The best damn
drink in the world.

01:10:49.945 --> 01:10:51.572
Yeah, yeah.

01:10:51.646 --> 01:10:55.605
Oh, man come on. You gotta get
over this not graduating thing

01:10:55.684 --> 01:10:59.518
at least tonight, we've got kegs
here and they have your name on them.

01:10:59.588 --> 01:11:03.718
Come on, we gotta party like
it's 1999 up in this bitch.

01:11:03.791 --> 01:11:04.985
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:06.186
Thank you.

01:11:06.262 --> 01:11:07.854
Want to get wasted?

01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:10.296
By all means.

01:11:10.366 --> 01:11:12.334
Oh, okay.

01:11:12.401 --> 01:11:13.891
What have you got?

01:11:13.969 --> 01:11:17.530
I got whatever
you need.

01:11:17.606 --> 01:11:19.733
Hey.

01:11:19.807 --> 01:11:21.274
Hey, how
are you?

01:11:21.343 --> 01:11:24.369
Uh... Um... Yeah,
you know what?

01:11:24.446 --> 01:11:28.348
I'm actually gonna get some cigarettes,
like lots and lots of cigarettes.

01:11:28.417 --> 01:11:30.180
Baby, I have a
pack right here.

01:11:30.252 --> 01:11:33.050
<i>Uh, I don't like
that kind. Dawn!</i>

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:35.852
Hm.

01:11:35.924 --> 01:11:38.620
I'll take it.

01:11:38.693 --> 01:11:41.958
Man, if you just gotta shake
that one off, just go ahead, bro.

01:11:42.031 --> 01:11:45.899
Do you wanna chill? Or do
you wanna chill with beer?

01:11:47.903 --> 01:11:49.734
Alright. Who
should we prank call?

01:11:51.807 --> 01:11:53.536
Let's get
Stacey's mom.

01:11:53.609 --> 01:11:55.236
Oh, dude.

01:11:59.715 --> 01:12:02.275
Alright.
Hold it, hold it.

01:12:02.351 --> 01:12:04.114
Uh-uh, uh-uh.

01:12:07.089 --> 01:12:10.786
<i>Stacey, Stacey is that you?</i>

01:12:10.859 --> 01:12:15.159
Yes, it's me, ma.
And I am smacked.

01:12:15.230 --> 01:12:17.164
<i>Stacey. </i>

01:12:17.232 --> 01:12:19.826
Maybe you can tell about
the sound of my voice

01:12:19.902 --> 01:12:23.599
that I am definitely
a man! And not your female daughter.

01:12:23.673 --> 01:12:26.642
<i>I know who you are. </i>

01:12:26.709 --> 01:12:30.167
Oh, do you now?
Shut up.

01:12:30.245 --> 01:12:33.476
<i>You took my goose! Is
Stacey doing the funny stuff?</i>

01:12:33.548 --> 01:12:37.848
<i>Is she? You put my Stacey on the phone
right now. Where is my damn goose?</i>

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:40.150
Ah! What?

01:12:40.222 --> 01:12:43.385
What in the hell
was she talking about?

01:12:43.459 --> 01:12:47.486
What... What
fucking goose, dude?

01:12:47.563 --> 01:12:50.259
I... I don't know.

01:12:50.332 --> 01:12:52.493
It could be
fucking that one.

01:12:56.405 --> 01:12:58.896
<i>Excuse me. 
What the fuck?</i>

01:13:00.476 --> 01:13:02.535
Thank God they
didn't just stop.

01:13:02.611 --> 01:13:06.240
<i>Yeah. I don't really want to
go to a keg party right now.</i>

01:13:06.315 --> 01:13:08.579
Everybody's
reacting so weird.

01:13:08.650 --> 01:13:14.486
<i>Should we just go lay down In that
nice grassy green field over there?</i>

01:13:14.556 --> 01:13:19.425
Yes!

01:13:19.495 --> 01:13:23.989
<i>Wow.</i>

01:13:24.066 --> 01:13:27.866
<i>Except I think there's like
some army soldiers out there too.</i>

01:13:34.676 --> 01:13:37.338
That's my boy. Now, come
on. Here comes round two.

01:13:43.886 --> 01:13:47.754
Ah! Hi.
Hi. Hi. Hi. Hey.

01:13:47.823 --> 01:13:49.017
Hey.

01:13:49.091 --> 01:13:51.184
Come here.
Concentrate.

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:53.319
Quick question.

01:13:53.395 --> 01:13:56.660
How bad
do you wanna fuck me?

01:13:56.733 --> 01:13:58.633
Don't think.
Just answer.

01:13:58.700 --> 01:13:59.792
Dawn!

01:13:59.868 --> 01:14:02.166
Okay.

01:14:02.237 --> 01:14:04.262
Yeah.

01:14:04.339 --> 01:14:06.000
No?

01:14:06.074 --> 01:14:06.972
No.

01:14:07.042 --> 01:14:08.031
Oh, God.

01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:09.634
What?

01:14:09.710 --> 01:14:11.769
<i>I'm sorry.
I don't understand.</i>

01:14:11.847 --> 01:14:14.475
So what? I ain't telling
you every God damned thing.

01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:16.017
Just be cool with me.

01:14:16.084 --> 01:14:18.143
Man, fuck this.

01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:21.018
You're right. Someone
should come in between them.

01:14:21.089 --> 01:14:24.115
You know, someone's gotta
play sacrificial asshole and...

01:14:24.193 --> 01:14:26.559
Well, uh...

01:14:26.628 --> 01:14:28.755
<i>Riley!</i>

01:14:28.831 --> 01:14:33.131
Oh! I can't
believe you're here.

01:14:33.202 --> 01:14:35.397
And look, I'm
even dried out.

01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:38.531
Oh, I liked
you all wet.

01:14:38.607 --> 01:14:40.199
Holla.

01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:42.909
I'm so happy
you came!

01:14:42.978 --> 01:14:44.536
<i>Man, fuck you!</i>

01:14:44.612 --> 01:14:48.070
Yeah, what
else is new?

01:14:59.761 --> 01:15:03.595
Hey, so, uh...

01:15:03.665 --> 01:15:07.294
it looks like little light
protectors and stars, you know,

01:15:07.369 --> 01:15:10.930
they pierce
straight through the sky.

01:15:11.006 --> 01:15:13.839
And they spotlight
us, you know?

01:15:13.909 --> 01:15:15.137
Yeah.

01:15:15.210 --> 01:15:19.647
Oh! How mother
fucking sweet!

01:15:19.715 --> 01:15:22.548
Oh, you kids
are so sweet.

01:15:22.617 --> 01:15:24.312
See that?
You see that?

01:15:24.386 --> 01:15:26.047
Okay. Alright.

01:15:27.155 --> 01:15:28.850
Look at that.

01:15:28.924 --> 01:15:32.155
Hey! Um,
can you not.

01:15:32.227 --> 01:15:34.991
Alright.

01:15:35.063 --> 01:15:37.463
See man, why you gotta be so punk?

01:15:37.533 --> 01:15:39.660
Whoa!

01:15:39.735 --> 01:15:41.532
I'm not.

01:15:41.603 --> 01:15:42.661
What?

01:15:42.739 --> 01:15:43.831
I'm actually normal.

01:15:45.807 --> 01:15:48.674
<i>Everything we do at all is God
coming through us.</i>

01:15:48.744 --> 01:15:53.647
<i>So how am I smoking weed? God
obviously put it here to grow</i>

01:15:53.715 --> 01:15:55.410
<i>on the Earth for us. </i>

01:15:55.484 --> 01:15:58.476
Weed is proof

01:15:58.555 --> 01:16:01.319
that God loves us and wants
us to be happy. Are you happy?

01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:02.516
I'm happy.

01:16:02.591 --> 01:16:04.218
<i>Are you happy?</i>

01:16:04.293 --> 01:16:06.056
<i>How many smoke weed?</i>

01:16:06.128 --> 01:16:07.220
<i>No, how many?</i>

01:16:07.296 --> 01:16:09.787
Let me tell you.

01:16:09.865 --> 01:16:11.264
A lot.

01:16:13.168 --> 01:16:14.692
Pass me the butt.

01:16:14.770 --> 01:16:17.830
<i>You're messing up
the whole philosophy.</i>

01:16:17.906 --> 01:16:22.400
Some of the kids, uh, something's
not right, something's wrong, uh,

01:16:22.477 --> 01:16:24.502
something is,
uh, backwards.

01:16:26.248 --> 01:16:27.738
<i>What do you mean?</i>

01:16:27.816 --> 01:16:29.784
<i>Everything is backwards.</i>

01:16:29.851 --> 01:16:31.318
Smoke. Just
smoke. Come on.

01:16:31.386 --> 01:16:33.047
There's something
in that, man.

01:16:33.121 --> 01:16:35.055
But you're the one
that gave it to us.

01:16:35.123 --> 01:16:37.489
I know, I know, I know,
Something's wrong.

01:16:37.559 --> 01:16:41.723
<i>Don't touch it. I
gotta go to a hospital.</i>

01:16:41.797 --> 01:16:43.788
Call a hospital.

01:16:43.865 --> 01:16:45.264
Are you okay?

01:16:45.334 --> 01:16:48.826
Yeah. Just
call... Just, um...

01:16:50.773 --> 01:16:52.741
<i>Just Ignore him. He's...</i>

01:16:52.807 --> 01:16:54.138
<i>Are you sure?</i>

01:16:54.209 --> 01:16:56.177
Yeah. He gets
anxiety attacks.

01:16:56.244 --> 01:17:00.271
Yeah, last week he thought
he was possessed by the devil.

01:17:00.349 --> 01:17:02.909
<i>He hid In the attic
for like three hours.</i>

01:17:02.985 --> 01:17:05.249
Ain't that great?

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:07.413
ADHD to yourself, man!

01:17:07.489 --> 01:17:09.354
Suck my
fucking ADHD dick.

01:17:09.424 --> 01:17:11.392
<i>Oh, God.</i>

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:13.655
Hey, man, I'm sorry.

01:17:13.729 --> 01:17:18.223
Oh, oh, oh.
When I'm riding in my car

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:19.892
Got my seat
on lean.

01:17:19.968 --> 01:17:22.459
Hey, Felix. You alright
man, you need help up?

01:17:22.537 --> 01:17:24.664
<i>When I'm at the house</i>

01:17:27.109 --> 01:17:29.270
Oh. God!

01:17:29.344 --> 01:17:31.505
Don't get all
emotional on us.

01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:34.481
Pete, look at her,
man. She's crying.

01:17:34.548 --> 01:17:35.981
Don't cry.

01:17:36.051 --> 01:17:37.712
I'm not crying!

01:17:37.786 --> 01:17:39.913
Yes, you are.

01:17:39.988 --> 01:17:43.754
Hey, guys, you know when you go to
the movies and you get to the sad part

01:17:43.825 --> 01:17:45.793
and your eye
always starts to itch

01:17:45.861 --> 01:17:50.628
but you can't scratch it because everybody
else is gonna think that you're crying.

01:17:50.699 --> 01:17:53.167
Where do you
come from?

01:17:53.235 --> 01:17:56.033
Man, everybody keeps
asking me that today.

01:17:56.104 --> 01:18:02.065
Dude, remember that time when I was
wasted and we found that secret island?

01:18:02.144 --> 01:18:05.079
That never happened.

01:18:05.147 --> 01:18:07.513
Damn it.

01:18:13.355 --> 01:18:16.813
Dude. Are you sure
that didn't happen?

01:18:16.892 --> 01:18:19.986
It never happened.

01:18:22.197 --> 01:18:24.165
Dude.

01:18:24.232 --> 01:18:27.998
I feel so bad about being
so annoying. You know?

01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:29.901
It's just so hard.

01:18:29.971 --> 01:18:32.735
The more you pull away,
the more suffocating I get.

01:18:32.808 --> 01:18:33.866
Shh.

01:18:33.942 --> 01:18:35.739
I can't help it...

01:18:35.811 --> 01:18:40.475
Please stop it, okay. We're gonna
try to have a normal night tonight.

01:18:40.549 --> 01:18:43.017
Alright.

01:18:43.085 --> 01:18:45.212
So I'm a cheerleader.

01:18:45.287 --> 01:18:47.915
Oh, yeah?
That's hot.

01:18:47.989 --> 01:18:52.426
Yeah, we, we practice more than
football and basketball players.

01:18:52.494 --> 01:18:54.826
Combined.

01:18:54.896 --> 01:18:57.922
You look like
you practice a lot.

01:18:59.501 --> 01:19:02.197
This town sucks.

01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:05.103
Yeah.

01:20:00.562 --> 01:20:04.692
I'll be right there.

01:20:04.766 --> 01:20:06.358
Damn, let's do this!

01:20:06.434 --> 01:20:09.494
God damn.

01:20:09.571 --> 01:20:11.562
Hang on. Wait, man.

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:13.505
Come on, come on.

01:20:13.575 --> 01:20:15.543
I got 'em!

01:20:15.609 --> 01:20:17.907
<i>One, two, three, four.</i>

01:20:17.979 --> 01:20:19.378
<i>One, two, three.</i>

01:20:25.921 --> 01:20:27.183
Yeah?

01:20:28.290 --> 01:20:30.383
It's Charles!

01:20:30.458 --> 01:20:34.121
<i>Charles! Charles!</i>

01:20:34.196 --> 01:20:35.857
Charles!

01:20:38.801 --> 01:20:40.598
Who the shit
is Charles?

01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:43.103
Oh, it's Eddie's
piss-wasted alter ego.

01:20:43.171 --> 01:20:47.733
Gimme that.
Gimme that.

01:20:47.809 --> 01:20:48.867
Charles.

01:20:51.813 --> 01:20:53.303
Sometimes it
gets violent.

01:20:53.381 --> 01:20:56.077
What are you doing, man?
Are you wearing some panties?

01:20:56.151 --> 01:21:00.247
I think you are. Why'd you let him
do that to you. You're a pussy, yo.

01:21:00.322 --> 01:21:03.758
Yo, get the fuck outta
here. Yo, do your thing, man!

01:21:03.825 --> 01:21:06.419
<i>Do your mother
fucking thing, Charles!</i>

01:21:06.494 --> 01:21:08.826
What is he doing?

01:21:08.897 --> 01:21:10.262
Ah!

01:21:15.503 --> 01:21:17.471
<i>Who's that?</i>

01:21:18.672 --> 01:21:20.606
<i>Oh, hell, no!</i>

01:21:20.675 --> 01:21:22.438
Somebody's
called the boys.

01:21:22.510 --> 01:21:24.705
Come on, let's go.
Let's fight these guys.

01:21:26.615 --> 01:21:29.277
<i>Let's go and kick their
mother fucking asses.</i>

01:21:29.351 --> 01:21:30.818
<i>Fight! Fight!</i>

01:21:30.886 --> 01:21:33.116
<i>Come on, come on. </i>

01:21:33.188 --> 01:21:35.656
Don't leave me.

01:21:35.723 --> 01:21:38.021
<i>What do you want? Huh?</i>

01:21:38.093 --> 01:21:41.324
I got a whole life right here.
I got a whole life right here.

01:22:09.257 --> 01:22:13.318
Come on, baby. Kick his
ass for me. Take him down!

01:22:27.008 --> 01:22:28.066
Bitch!

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:46.120
Want some more?

01:22:46.194 --> 01:22:47.354
Want some more?

01:22:47.429 --> 01:22:50.364
What the fuck...?

01:22:52.167 --> 01:22:54.601
Did you just see
Zack attack Biz?

01:22:54.669 --> 01:22:56.603
That was awesome.

01:23:28.003 --> 01:23:29.197
<i>It's Tupac!</i>

01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:30.737
My man, Ponte!

01:23:30.805 --> 01:23:32.295
<i>Who's Ponte?</i>

01:23:32.374 --> 01:23:34.171
<i>That guy's In a gang.</i>

01:23:34.242 --> 01:23:36.904
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

01:23:36.978 --> 01:23:38.741
Fuck West Po Homie.

01:23:38.813 --> 01:23:40.440
What's going on?

01:23:40.515 --> 01:23:42.779
<i>Come on, let's go. 
We gotta get outta here. </i>

01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:44.944
Is that my boy, Charles?

01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:47.614
I am. I am.

01:23:47.689 --> 01:23:49.816
<i>Go have sex with
your mother, bitch.</i>

01:23:49.891 --> 01:23:51.381
Take that.

01:23:58.133 --> 01:23:59.998
It's like

01:24:00.068 --> 01:24:03.333
you're supposed to be
starting the next big something

01:24:03.405 --> 01:24:07.136
this upcoming millennium but I have
no clue what I should do with myself.

01:24:07.208 --> 01:24:08.732
Make a difference.

01:24:08.810 --> 01:24:11.438
Maybe the Y2K will
blow up the world.

01:24:21.856 --> 01:24:23.687
<i>Go, come on. This way.</i>

01:24:31.266 --> 01:24:32.790
<i>I'm, I'm proud of you.</i>

01:24:32.867 --> 01:24:34.528
<i>My fucking jaw.</i>

01:24:34.602 --> 01:24:37.662
My knees. I didn't get punched.
Because I used my knees. Yeah.

01:24:37.738 --> 01:24:40.434
Fuck.

01:24:40.508 --> 01:24:43.500
Man, I wanna know who in
the hell bitch-slapped me.

01:24:43.578 --> 01:24:45.205
Man, I swear it
looked like Zack.

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:48.374
No, man. Zack can't
even hold his own dick.

01:24:48.450 --> 01:24:50.042
Hey, you
know what?

01:24:50.118 --> 01:24:53.281
We should go to that
bitch Holly's house.

01:24:53.354 --> 01:24:54.378
It's a ha-ha.

01:24:55.590 --> 01:24:57.217
I'm just
gonna take off.

01:24:57.292 --> 01:24:58.657
What?

01:24:58.725 --> 01:25:00.386
How are we
gonna find a ride?

01:25:00.462 --> 01:25:03.454
I don't know, but
I'm gonna go home.

01:25:03.531 --> 01:25:05.294
What the...

01:25:07.235 --> 01:25:09.169
<i>You're crazy.</i>

01:25:09.237 --> 01:25:12.138
You see, the whole fight,
it was like nothing to me

01:25:12.207 --> 01:25:15.005
I've been working
out a lot, wanna see?

01:25:15.076 --> 01:25:16.168
You wanna feel them?

01:25:16.244 --> 01:25:18.041
Yeah. Yeah.

01:25:18.113 --> 01:25:20.775
Enough.

01:25:25.019 --> 01:25:27.817
Are you gay?

01:25:27.889 --> 01:25:31.518
Nah. Nah.

01:25:31.593 --> 01:25:34.426
I just don't care.
You know?

01:25:34.496 --> 01:25:36.293
About what?

01:25:36.364 --> 01:25:40.391
Being like everybody
else, you know?

01:25:40.468 --> 01:25:43.494
I love life
and I'm living it!

01:25:43.571 --> 01:25:45.971
But Eddie
Style, though.

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:47.064
Eddie Style.

01:25:47.142 --> 01:25:48.609
It's a good style.

01:25:48.676 --> 01:25:53.045
<i>You have to go after
what you want and get it!</i>

01:25:53.114 --> 01:25:54.308
Am I right?

01:25:54.382 --> 01:25:57.283
Dad says it's not
getting what you want

01:25:57.352 --> 01:25:59.513
but wanting
what you've got.

01:25:59.587 --> 01:26:02.112
Yeah? Well, your
dad didn't know shit.

01:26:04.392 --> 01:26:07.293
Only you know
what you want.

01:26:26.981 --> 01:26:29.472
Eddie. Where's Dylan?

01:26:29.551 --> 01:26:31.985
Man, I don't know. Go
call the cops or something.

01:26:32.053 --> 01:26:35.454
You're the one who called him out
of the woods and he never came back.

01:26:35.523 --> 01:26:36.854
So where is he?

01:26:36.925 --> 01:26:40.656
What were you guys
doing in the woods?

01:26:40.728 --> 01:26:44.391
What? Why are you always taking
so many stupid ass pictures?

01:26:44.465 --> 01:26:47.161
I mean, why? Why did you
just take a picture of me?

01:26:47.235 --> 01:26:51.171
What is so great about this? What is
so fucking great about all this? Huh?

01:27:23.838 --> 01:27:25.863
You're still here.

01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:28.340
Yes.

01:27:28.409 --> 01:27:31.435
Life sucks.

01:27:31.512 --> 01:27:33.104
Yeah.

01:28:31.172 --> 01:28:33.572
It's my
Mom's goose.

01:28:43.818 --> 01:28:46.912
Let's break
into a boat.

01:28:46.988 --> 01:28:50.549
Whatever's clever.

01:28:50.626 --> 01:28:52.856
It's all you.

01:28:52.927 --> 01:28:55.122
Let's do it.

01:29:12.347 --> 01:29:14.815
You know we can't do
this forever, right?

01:29:14.882 --> 01:29:15.974
I know.

01:29:16.050 --> 01:29:17.312
Okay.

01:29:17.385 --> 01:29:20.115
It's just that I
never actually thought

01:29:20.188 --> 01:29:22.588
about the reality
of that, you know?

01:29:22.657 --> 01:29:24.284
Because I've
been so happy.

01:29:24.359 --> 01:29:26.657
We have not
been so happy.

01:29:26.728 --> 01:29:28.161
<i>Look, </i>

01:29:28.229 --> 01:29:29.924
<i>the longer
that we do this</i>

01:29:29.997 --> 01:29:33.455
the harder it's gonna be when the
inevitable eventually does come.

01:29:33.534 --> 01:29:35.229
<i>Which it will. </i>

01:29:35.303 --> 01:29:38.568
There's really just like no reason
for this shit to go any longer.

01:29:38.639 --> 01:29:40.436
So being in love
isn't a reason?

01:29:40.508 --> 01:29:43.966
<i>We would always have to hide
and that doesn't make any sense.</i>

01:29:44.045 --> 01:29:45.672
We do not always
have to hide it.

01:29:45.747 --> 01:29:47.510
Who gives a shit?

01:29:47.582 --> 01:29:50.710
<i>What are you so scared of?
Why won't you give us a try?</i>

01:29:50.785 --> 01:29:54.186
Because I can't handle what
that might end up meaning.

01:30:45.006 --> 01:30:46.701
Hm. I hate
you already.

01:30:46.774 --> 01:30:49.265
<i>Hi, Angie, it's Stacey. 
I'm in your neighborhood</i>

01:30:49.343 --> 01:30:51.504
<i>and I was just wondering,
is your sister in?</i>

01:30:51.579 --> 01:30:52.876
Did you drive
by my house?

01:30:52.947 --> 01:30:54.414
Yeah, I did.

01:30:54.482 --> 01:30:55.972
<i>Was her car
parked outside?</i>

01:30:56.050 --> 01:30:57.074
No.

01:30:57.151 --> 01:30:59.312
So, what? Are
you retarded?

01:30:59.387 --> 01:31:01.719
<i>Do you think maybe I
can just sleep over there?</i>

01:31:01.789 --> 01:31:03.984
Yes, fine. You know
where the key is.

01:31:04.058 --> 01:31:05.616
Can I please go
back to sleep?

01:31:05.693 --> 01:31:06.682
<i>Oh, wait, Angie. </i>

01:31:06.761 --> 01:31:09.423
Uh. Do you have any pot?

01:31:09.497 --> 01:31:13.524
Wait. Um. Tell me if this sounds
like a phone hanging up on you?

01:31:13.601 --> 01:31:16.007
Yes.
