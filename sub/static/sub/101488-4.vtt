Come on! We're dying out here!

00:22.765 --> 00:24.523
I spent all week
on that costume.

00:24.641 --> 00:26.266
-We want to see you in it.
-LOUISE: Hold on, woman!

00:26.343 --> 00:28.185
Three kids getting
in a group costume here.

00:28.195 --> 00:30.312
There's a lot
of Tina's boobs in my face.

00:30.388 --> 00:31.188
GENE: And Gene's.

00:31.198 --> 00:32.865
So, Teddy,

00:32.941 --> 00:34.357
you gonna go home
and hand out candy?

00:34.368 --> 00:35.984
Uh, no,
I'm gonna go donate blood,

00:36.061 --> 00:37.444
the candy of the veins.

00:37.521 --> 00:39.780
Ugh. I mean, good for you.

00:39.856 --> 00:42.041
You're gonna donate blood?
At night? On Halloween?

00:42.076 --> 00:43.825
Yeah, it's fun.
They turn the bloodmobile

00:43.902 --> 00:45.702
into a vampire mobile.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.788
Hey, you guys should come.
It's right down the street.

00:47.864 --> 00:49.381
I want to give my blood
to a vampire car.

00:49.458 --> 00:51.333
Bob, What do you say?

00:51.409 --> 00:53.376
-You want to come donate blood
with me and Linda?
-Mm, no.

00:53.387 --> 00:55.721
Bob's a little squeamish
around blood,

00:55.798 --> 00:57.380
but I'm in
'cause I'm a good person.

00:57.415 --> 00:58.715
Great. You know what
blood type you are?

00:58.726 --> 01:00.717
I'm AB. It's half an ABBA.

01:00.728 --> 01:03.804
I'm A positive. I remember
'cause it was my first A plus.

01:03.880 --> 01:05.639
And Bob is O negative.
I remember that 'cause I said,

01:05.715 --> 01:07.399
"Oh, don't be negative
just 'cause

01:07.476 --> 01:08.850
I got a better grade
on my blood test, you."

01:08.927 --> 01:11.353
-(laughs)
-Wait. Bob, you're O negative?

01:11.429 --> 01:12.646
-That's amazing.
-Why?

01:12.722 --> 01:14.564
Isn't O negative stupid blood?

01:14.575 --> 01:16.909
No, O negative is
the universal donor blood.

01:16.985 --> 01:18.860
They can put your blood
in anyone.

01:18.937 --> 01:20.904
-Your blood is hero blood.
-Oh, God, is it?

01:20.915 --> 01:22.155
You got to come donate blood

01:22.232 --> 01:23.865
No, I don't, Teddy.

01:23.942 --> 01:25.992
And I know that might make me
a horrible person,

01:26.111 --> 01:27.402

Wow. Hero blood just
sloshing around inside of you.

01:39.624 --> 01:41.758
What? Oh. Ha!
'Cause you're a snail.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.602
You guys can breathe
in there, right?

01:43.679 --> 01:44.770
I don't want to be the mom

01:44.847 --> 01:46.847
who suffocated her kids
in a giant snail.

01:46.923 --> 01:48.107
We can breathe just fine.
See, I'm breathing

01:48.183 --> 01:49.424
through the candy-hatch here.

01:49.501 --> 01:51.393
I thought we were calling that
the fart vent.

01:51.469 --> 01:53.895
It's both. And it also happens
to be wide enough

01:53.972 --> 01:55.447
for an entire bowl of candy

01:55.524 --> 01:57.357
from a certain
candy-stiffer's house.

01:57.434 --> 01:59.776
I-I mean,
a single piece of candy,

01:59.787 --> 02:01.194
which is all we plan
on taking.

02:01.271 --> 02:03.196
Wait a minute.
Does this have anything to do

02:03.273 --> 02:05.457
with that one house that ran out
of candy a few years ago

02:05.534 --> 02:07.126
that you can't let go
of for some reason?

02:07.202 --> 02:08.702
First of all,
it was two years ago,

02:08.778 --> 02:11.121
and then they stiffed me again
last year,

02:11.132 --> 02:12.789
but I can't believe
you remember that.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.292
I barely remember that.

-Wait. Seriously?
You're out of candy?

Come back next year,
and we'll, uh...

02:28.649 --> 02:30.432
we'll give you
twice as much candy, okay?

02:30.508 --> 02:32.309
Yes, of course.
These things happen.

02:43.980 --> 02:45.330
Guys, it's me, from last year.

02:45.407 --> 02:46.990
From when you ran out of candy,

02:47.001 --> 02:48.617
and you promised
to make it up this year?

02:48.693 --> 02:50.669
Mm, no, I don't remember that.

02:50.746 --> 02:52.621
(laughs) You're messing with me.
Good one.

02:52.697 --> 02:54.748
Okay, now go ahead and plop
another candy into my bag.

02:54.824 --> 02:57.176
-Excuse me?
-You guys owe me double candy.

02:57.252 --> 03:00.587
So, double me up. On the double.
Let's go, double time.

03:00.664 --> 03:02.514
Okay, I think you should go now.

03:02.591 --> 03:05.091
Not without my candy!
Let me at that bowl!

03:05.168 --> 03:08.470
You know what?
Now we're gonna take<i> this</i> back.

03:08.546 --> 03:09.763
No!
That's-that's my property!

-(panting)
-Aah! Get away! Get off me!

03:18.014 --> 03:19.198
There were attack leopards?

03:19.274 --> 03:21.316
I don't remember
the attack leopards.

03:21.393 --> 03:23.485

probably just blocked it out.

A-a to-go order? Uh, uh, wait.
Let me get a pen.

03:28.042 --> 03:29.616
-Where's a pen?
-Uh, pen, pen, pen.

03:29.693 --> 03:30.825
Want me to make one
real quick?

03:30.902 --> 03:32.544
I got a bucket of paint
in the truck.

03:32.621 --> 03:33.954
Can we have
a quick snail conference?

03:34.030 --> 03:35.705
Louise, when I signed on
for this costume,

03:35.716 --> 03:37.999
I was hoping to do
some major sibling bonding.

03:38.076 --> 03:39.626
-And we will.
-I guess I just thought,

03:39.703 --> 03:41.253
once we got
inside the snail suit,

03:41.329 --> 03:42.870
you'd hopefully
change your mind

03:42.948 --> 03:45.557
and maybe<i> not</i> want to steal
an entire bowl of candy?

03:45.634 --> 03:47.509
Yeah, I don't want
bad candy karma.

03:47.585 --> 03:49.469
Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup,
not<i> stealing.</i>

03:49.546 --> 03:50.845
It's candy justice.

03:50.922 --> 03:52.681
Hey, when someone stiffs
one of us,

03:52.757 --> 03:54.516
they stiff<i> all</i> of us,
right, guys?

03:54.592 --> 03:56.851
-I... guess?
-The Three Stiff-ka-teers.

03:56.928 --> 03:58.561
Don't worry
your snail head about this.

03:58.572 --> 03:59.813
We're gonna walk up
to their house.

03:59.889 --> 04:02.190
They open the door.
They won't see our faces.

04:02.267 --> 04:03.858
Tina, you'll do all
the talking.

04:03.935 --> 04:06.319
Distract them by commenting
on their decor.

04:06.396 --> 04:08.488
Maybe something like
the line we talked about.

04:08.565 --> 04:10.582
(sighs) "Check out that wall.

04:10.617 --> 04:12.584
"Where'd you get it? Walmart?"

04:12.661 --> 04:14.753
Exactly. Anyway,
they'll start blabbering,

04:14.830 --> 04:16.588
I'll open the hatch
and grab their candy bowl.

04:16.665 --> 04:18.707
-Justice served.
-Uh...

04:18.783 --> 04:20.259
So I guess
we're gonna deliver a burger.

04:20.335 --> 04:22.210
-We do that?
-It's for someone staying

04:22.287 --> 04:23.595
at the hotel
at the end of the block.

04:23.672 --> 04:25.588
It's so close,
I just said "yes."

04:25.599 --> 04:27.432
Also, making money
is... is good.

04:27.509 --> 04:29.509
-Right?
-Attaboy, Bob.

04:29.586 --> 04:31.011
-Uh, we can deliver it
for you, Dad.
-Really?

04:31.087 --> 04:32.887
Yeah. And it's not
at all because

04:32.964 --> 04:34.723
I'm putting off something
that I really don't want to do.

04:34.799 --> 04:36.108
No, no, no, no, no.
Sorry, Dad.

04:36.184 --> 04:38.110
We're busy. Nice try.

04:38.186 --> 04:40.562
-They might give us a tip.
-Okay, we'll do it.

04:40.638 --> 04:42.948
I mean, who can resist
tipping three adorable kids

04:43.025 --> 04:45.275

Uh-oh. I may have dropped it
in creepy lady's room

06:09.370 --> 06:10.610
because I was scared
and so were my hands?

06:10.687 --> 06:12.529

We need that.

06:15.525 --> 06:17.158
Wait. What?
Go back into there?

06:17.235 --> 06:19.869
Or we leave the shell part
up there,

06:19.880 --> 06:22.622
we don't do your plan, and now
our costume is a confident snail

06:22.699 --> 06:24.274
that's coming out of its shell?

06:24.276 --> 06:26.918
No, we're gonna get the shell,
then everything's gonna be fine.

06:26.995 --> 06:29.337

-Where'd you come from?
-From right down here.

I was bending over.
So, are you trick-or-treating?

06:40.475 --> 06:42.517
We don't get a ton
of trick-or-treaters,

06:42.594 --> 06:45.237
but we got a bunch of
sewing kits or shower caps.

06:45.313 --> 06:47.480
-You look like shower-cap kids.
-Thank you.

06:47.557 --> 06:48.815
We were just here delivering
a burger

06:48.892 --> 06:51.151
to a creepy old lady
in room 313,

06:51.227 --> 06:53.528

of our costume in there.

06:53.605 --> 06:55.613
Ah, Dolores. (chuckles)

06:55.690 --> 06:56.915
I guess conjuring up the spirit

06:56.992 --> 06:58.575
of your dead lover
can make you hungry.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.493
Wait. Did you say
"Conjuring the spirit"?

07:00.570 --> 07:02.328
"Of her dead lover"?

07:02.405 --> 07:04.914
Yup. Dolores checks
into room 313

07:04.925 --> 07:06.591
every Halloween
to conjure him up.

07:06.668 --> 07:07.917
Brings in a lot of lookie-loos.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.836
Good for business.

07:09.913 --> 07:11.430
Well, you should see us
the rest of the year.

07:11.506 --> 07:13.381
-Hi, kids.
-Oh, hi, Gus.

07:13.458 --> 07:15.842
-They were just asking
about Dolores.
-Yup.

07:15.919 --> 07:18.720
Dolores's lover died
on Halloween night

07:18.796 --> 07:23.391
in room 313, 50 years ago,
so she comes up here every year

07:23.468 --> 07:25.277
to conjure up Roger's spirit.

07:25.353 --> 07:27.228
-Aw.
-A Roger conjure.

07:27.305 --> 07:28.780
And a bunch of us hang out
in the lobby,

07:28.857 --> 07:31.524
take in the vibe,
have a few drinks,

07:31.601 --> 07:33.276
and hope the ghost shows up.

07:33.287 --> 07:36.288
It's a haunted hoot.
And, you know, Dolores would be

07:36.364 --> 07:38.623
an age-appropriate match
for Old Gus.

07:38.700 --> 07:40.283
Sorry, Gus.
We're on the clock.

07:40.294 --> 07:41.367
So, can we mm...?

07:41.444 --> 07:43.628
Uh...

07:43.705 --> 07:47.207
Totally normal lady,
it's us again.

07:47.283 --> 07:49.626
May I just grab that
snail shell? Don't hurt me.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.085
Good luck
on conjuring the spirit

07:51.162 --> 07:52.587
-of your dead lover.
-Thank you.

07:52.664 --> 07:54.639
Does it work, by the way?
I'm just curious.

07:54.716 --> 07:56.758
It hasn't worked yet,
but hopefully,

07:56.834 --> 07:59.311
by adding his favorite food
as bait--

07:59.387 --> 08:02.472
this cheeseburger--
I can finally lure him here.

08:02.483 --> 08:03.806
Well, we're rooting for you two.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.317
And when he shows up,

08:05.393 --> 08:07.268
I'll banish him to hell
for all eternity.

08:07.345 --> 08:08.895
-Huh?
-What?
-Whoa.

08:08.972 --> 08:10.980
Oh, crap.
I hope Roger didn't hear that.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.658
Well, that sounds fun, but we
got to snail-trail out of here.

08:13.735 --> 08:15.318
Or maybe we can stay
a little bit.

08:15.329 --> 08:17.070
I just want
to catch some dark arts,

08:17.146 --> 08:18.321
-hear the damnation download.
-Ugh.

08:18.332 --> 08:20.198
Okay, a minute.

08:20.275 --> 08:21.666
It's so great
you're coming with us, Bob.

08:21.743 --> 08:23.668
I'm walking with you.

08:23.745 --> 08:25.828
I'm gonna look at the van
because Teddy said

08:25.839 --> 08:27.247
he wouldn't leave
unless I look at the van.

08:27.323 --> 08:29.123
Trust me, once you see
what they did to it,

08:29.200 --> 08:31.084
you'll change your mind
about donating blood.

08:31.160 --> 08:33.419
-TEDDY: Huh?
-LINDA: Fun.

08:33.496 --> 08:36.130
(as Dracula):
Welcome to Transyl-vein-ya.

08:36.207 --> 08:37.840
-Get it?
-(as Dracula): Soon,

08:37.851 --> 08:40.426
we will drain you
of one pint of your human blood.

08:40.503 --> 08:43.304
Then you can relax here
and enjoy cookies and juice.

08:43.381 --> 08:45.023
(sighs)
Oh, boy.

08:45.100 --> 08:46.307
Uh, okay, I saw it.
Now I'm leaving.

08:46.384 --> 08:48.351
(coughs)
O negative.

08:48.362 --> 08:50.687
-What?
-(coughs) O negative. Mm-hmm.

08:50.697 --> 08:52.188
O neg? Really? Uh...

08:52.199 --> 08:53.940
(as Dracula):
Well, well, well.

08:54.017 --> 08:55.316
(as Dracula):
It's not every day we get

08:55.393 --> 08:57.860
to suck a universal
blood donor's blood.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.854
Wait, I-I'm not donating blood.

08:59.931 --> 09:02.574
(normal voice):
Huh, seriously? You're O neg,
but you're not gonna donate?

09:02.650 --> 09:05.326
Sorry, guys, I just have a thing
about blood and needles.

09:05.403 --> 09:08.121
You'll be fine. We work with
needle weenies all the time.

09:08.197 --> 09:10.707
Uh, I-I don't love that term.

09:10.759 --> 09:13.218
Hey, just think of how happy
you could make someone.

09:13.295 --> 09:15.336
(in childish voice):
Hey, mister, you saved my life,

09:15.413 --> 09:18.339
and now I'm gonna go out
and save the rain forest.

09:18.416 --> 09:20.383
You're doing a lot of voices.

09:20.394 --> 09:22.844
Oh, no. I'm slipping away.

09:22.920 --> 09:25.388
Beep. Beep.<i> Beep...</i>

09:25.399 --> 09:27.390
-He's dying.
-Somebody do something!

09:27.401 --> 09:29.892
Fine. I'll donate
my really great blood.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.394
-Yay.
-You just saved the boy

09:31.405 --> 09:33.146
who's gonna save
the rain forest.

09:33.222 --> 09:34.406
What's the "rain forest"?

09:34.482 --> 09:36.232
<i> LOUISE:</i>
<i> So what did Roger do</i>

09:36.243 --> 09:38.151
to deserve eternal damnation?

09:38.227 --> 09:39.986
Did he eat
the last slice of pizza?

09:40.063 --> 09:41.580
Oh, it was a long time ago.

09:41.656 --> 09:43.239
We were young, we were dating.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.416
I hate him.

09:44.492 --> 09:46.418
We were edgy back then.

09:46.494 --> 09:49.254
We were even gonna try this
new thing called "Thai food,"

09:49.331 --> 09:52.373
but we had to leave 'cause
Roger came down with a cold.

09:52.450 --> 09:55.835
Even coughing and sneezing,
he was a handsome bastard.

09:55.912 --> 09:58.379
-Hot. I think?
-But our last date was

09:58.456 --> 10:01.266
at the Halloween party
in this hotel,

10:01.343 --> 10:02.601
<i> 50 years ago.</i>

10:02.677 --> 10:05.219
<i> Roger looked amazing</i>
<i> as Spartacus.</i>

10:05.296 --> 10:07.180
<i> It seemed like</i>
<i>we were in our own little world.</i>

10:07.256 --> 10:10.850
<i>He was tossing nuts into the air</i>
<i> and catching them in his mouth</i>

10:10.927 --> 10:12.226
-to impress me.
-GENE: I'm impressed.

10:12.303 --> 10:16.022
I was, too.
How do people do that?

10:16.099 --> 10:19.734
<i> Roger went to get us drinks,</i>
<i> and he never came back.</i>

10:19.811 --> 10:22.904
-What?
-I asked around,
if anyone's seen Spartacus.

10:22.980 --> 10:25.073
<i> People kept saying,</i>
<i> "I am Spartacus,"</i>

10:25.149 --> 10:26.458
<i> but I hadn't seen the movie,</i>

10:26.534 --> 10:27.867
so I didn't know
what they were referring to.

10:27.944 --> 10:30.128
Finally, someone told me that

10:30.205 --> 10:33.414
<i> they saw him at the elevator</i>
<i> with I Dream of Jeannie.</i>

10:33.491 --> 10:34.415
<i> I couldn't believe it.</i>

10:34.492 --> 10:36.292
<i> I was devastated.</i>

10:36.303 --> 10:40.421
<i> The next day, I read</i>
<i> in the paper that he'd died</i>

10:40.498 --> 10:42.090
in this very room.

10:42.166 --> 10:43.257
He was murdered?

10:43.334 --> 10:44.884
No, it was cardiac arrest.

10:45.002 --> 10:46.645
There was no sign of foul play,

10:46.721 --> 10:49.222
but I bet there was
some foreplay, the creep.

10:49.298 --> 10:52.225
They canoodled, she left,
and then he died.

10:52.301 --> 10:53.267
Typical man.

10:53.344 --> 10:55.436
And so, every year since,

10:55.513 --> 10:58.990
I've come here
to conjure that no-good,

10:59.067 --> 11:00.325
cheating S.O.B.'s spirit

11:00.402 --> 11:02.494
and send it to hell!

11:02.570 --> 11:05.738
I mean, wasn't him dying
kind of enough of a punishment?

11:05.815 --> 11:07.156
Hell just seems
like kind of a lot.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.324
And so sweaty.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.493
Tina, let her have it.
I get it.

11:10.504 --> 11:12.120
I got my own little vendetta
going on tonight.

11:12.196 --> 11:13.663
Can't you both just move on?

11:13.674 --> 11:16.165
Halloween's about forgiveness...
I think.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.793
Forgiveness and Frankenstein--
the two Fs.

11:18.870 --> 11:20.461
Yeah, so maybe forgive this guy

11:20.538 --> 11:22.347
who wrote you what looks
like 10,000 love letters.

11:22.424 --> 11:24.349
-(scoffs)
-"Dear Glorious Dolores,

11:24.426 --> 11:27.176
"I was thinking of you today,
and it made me think of you--

11:27.187 --> 11:30.054
"your smell, your neck parts,
the way your eyes light up

11:30.131 --> 11:31.848
when I smell your neck parts."

11:31.858 --> 11:34.025
Dolores, this doesn't sound
like a cheater wrote it.

11:34.144 --> 11:35.360
A cheater<i> did</i> write it.

11:35.437 --> 11:37.186
But what if what you think
happened didn't happen?

11:37.197 --> 11:39.105
What if there's
another explanation?

11:39.182 --> 11:41.107
Okay, Miss I Just Walked
in Here with a Burger

11:41.184 --> 11:42.817
and Now I Know Everything."

11:42.894 --> 11:45.111
Yeah, knock it off,
<i> Stally</i> Parton.

11:45.188 --> 11:47.155
We've got to go see
a Ven about a Detta.

11:47.231 --> 11:48.707
(groans)
I don't want to vendetta.

11:48.783 --> 11:50.616
And I don't think Dolores
should vendetta, either.

11:50.693 --> 11:52.785
-I mean, isn't it possible
Roger is innocent?
-No.

11:52.862 --> 11:54.495
-But maybe?
-No!

11:54.572 --> 11:55.955
But what if there was a way to
figure out that he didn't cheat?

11:56.032 --> 11:57.716
There's not, so drop it.

11:57.792 --> 12:00.793
Yeah, Tina, drop it so we can go
pick-up some stinkin' candy!

12:00.870 --> 12:02.044
Wait, how about this?

12:02.055 --> 12:03.796
Give me a chance--
it's still early.

12:03.873 --> 12:05.223
If I can't figure it out,
I'll go do your plan.

12:05.300 --> 12:07.216
Sounds good. I like that.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.343
But if I can, then we go
trick-or-treating like normal.

12:09.420 --> 12:10.845
No vendettas, just candy.

12:10.922 --> 12:12.063
Ooh, I like<i> that.</i>

12:12.140 --> 12:13.231
So what do you say?

12:13.308 --> 12:15.099
I say you're on,
you poor romantic idiot.

12:15.176 --> 12:16.142
Oh, my!

12:16.219 --> 12:18.394
This one's<i> not</i> rated PG-13.

12:18.405 --> 12:19.696
-Give me that.
-(chuckles): Oh.

12:24.152 --> 12:25.401
<i> WOMAN (gasps):</i>
<i> I just got cold, right?</i>

12:25.412 --> 12:26.694
Is it cold in here?
Ghost-y cold?

12:26.771 --> 12:28.079
Could be ghost-y cold.

12:28.156 --> 12:29.530
Ah, this is gonna be the year.

12:29.607 --> 12:31.240
I bought this camera online.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.751
It can take pictures
of apparitions.

12:32.827 --> 12:33.743
And Jupiter.

12:33.754 --> 12:34.610
Jupiter's my cat.

12:34.612 --> 12:36.070
Okay.
So, it's not great

12:36.147 --> 12:38.456
that Dolores kicked us out
of her room to keep conjuring.

12:38.533 --> 12:40.500
But at least she let us keep
some letters and photos.

12:40.576 --> 12:42.668
-Hot leads here, I betcha.
-Come on, Tina.

12:42.745 --> 12:44.921
Give up, and let's go get
that bowl of candy

12:44.931 --> 12:46.431
while there's still candy in it.

12:46.508 --> 12:48.600
No. I'm gonna prove
Roger's not a cheater,

12:48.676 --> 12:49.717
and then we're gonna
trick-or-treat

12:49.794 --> 12:51.219
without committing
any candy crimes.

12:51.295 --> 12:53.054
Okay.
So, here's a group photo.

12:53.130 --> 12:54.889
Halloween night, 50 years ago.

12:54.966 --> 12:56.941
And there's I Dream of Jeannie,
the temptress.

12:57.018 --> 12:58.109
But who was she?

12:58.186 --> 12:59.110
GENE
She's tall,

12:59.187 --> 13:00.779
likes big, boxy belt buckles,

13:00.855 --> 13:02.355
-BBBBs.
-Yeah, what's up

13:02.431 --> 13:03.564
with that boxy belt buckle?

13:03.641 --> 13:04.949
It's not very genie-ish.

13:05.026 --> 13:07.109
Kinda just looks
like the belt buckle of someone

13:07.120 --> 13:09.120
-who steals someone's boyfriend.
-(door opens)

13:09.197 --> 13:11.197
Did I miss anything?
Any sightings? Any cold spots?

13:11.274 --> 13:12.865
I felt a cold spot.
Didn't I just say that?

13:12.942 --> 13:14.075
I think I just said that.

13:14.151 --> 13:15.627
I think you might just be
underdressed?

13:15.703 --> 13:18.296
You guys seem a little young
to be conjuring enthusiasts.

13:18.373 --> 13:20.081
Oh, no, some of us
are trying to prove

13:20.157 --> 13:22.133
that Dolores's theory
about Roger is wrong.

13:22.210 --> 13:24.135
Wait a minute,
you think Roger<i> wasn't</i>

13:24.212 --> 13:25.461
a cheating cheat-face cheater?

13:25.472 --> 13:26.796
I know.
It's ridiculous.

13:26.807 --> 13:28.256
It's not ridiculous,
and I'm gonna prove it,

13:28.332 --> 13:30.132
if I can just concentrate
for a second.

13:30.143 --> 13:33.261
Uh, but, uh, can that wait
until after she conjures Roger?

13:33.337 --> 13:34.720
I kinda told everyone at work

13:34.797 --> 13:37.148
that I was gonna take a picture
of a ghost.

13:37.225 --> 13:38.650
-(whimpering)
-Okay. We're all set.

13:38.726 --> 13:40.151
Now it's time for-- Hey!

13:40.228 --> 13:41.936
That's an amazing
Big Bird costume.

13:42.013 --> 13:42.937
(squeals)

13:43.014 --> 13:43.980
-You felt that?
-Yes!

13:43.990 --> 13:44.939
But I distracted you.

13:45.016 --> 13:46.157
My arm still feels it

13:46.234 --> 13:47.158
when you shove a needle in it!

13:47.235 --> 13:48.150
(sighs):
Oh, boy.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.485
-Uh, what?
-(groans)

13:49.496 --> 13:50.995
Looks like I didn't find a vein.

13:51.072 --> 13:52.905
-I'm gonna have to try it again.
-(weakly): What?

13:52.982 --> 13:54.949
Hey, uh, look at that,
uh,<i> Star Wars</i> costume.

13:55.026 --> 13:56.325
-Space, am I right?
-(squeals)

13:56.336 --> 13:58.578
-Did you get it?
-No, nope, nope. Not in.

13:58.654 --> 14:00.371
Your veins roll away
from the needle.

14:00.448 --> 14:01.840
(woozy gurgling)

14:01.916 --> 14:03.675
It's like your veins
are playing hard to get, Bob.

14:03.751 --> 14:04.917
Not like mine.

14:04.994 --> 14:06.919
The needle slid
right into my beefy vein.

14:06.996 --> 14:08.546
-(gurgling)
-(groans)

14:08.623 --> 14:09.922
Let's try the other arm.

14:09.999 --> 14:11.591
Okay, really make a fist
this time.

14:11.667 --> 14:12.851
Hey! Oh, look. There!

14:12.927 --> 14:14.927
-(squeals)
-(groans) Damn it.

14:15.004 --> 14:17.021
You said you were very good
with needle weenies.

14:17.098 --> 14:18.931
You're the worst weenie
I've ever had.

14:19.008 --> 14:20.933
This is ridiculous.

14:21.010 --> 14:22.861
It's Halloween, and all I've got
is this bowl of nuts.

14:22.937 --> 14:24.178
(chewing)

14:24.255 --> 14:26.364
Uh, I-I feel totally close
to a-a breakthrough.

14:26.441 --> 14:27.940
(chewing)
Well, now I'm thirsty.

14:28.017 --> 14:30.776
Do you think the barkeep knows
his way around a ginger ale?

14:30.853 --> 14:33.154
Wait, Roger went to get drinks
after he was eating nuts.

14:33.230 --> 14:34.372
(gasps dramatically)
Oh, my God, Tina.

14:34.449 --> 14:36.824
You mean salty peanuts
made someone thirsty?

14:36.901 --> 14:39.118
Are we on<i> CSI: Salty Nut Unit?</i>

14:39.195 --> 14:41.162
Dumb investigation time is over.

14:41.238 --> 14:42.046
It's candy bowl o'clock.

14:42.123 --> 14:43.789
-Let's go.
-No, I'm so close.

14:43.866 --> 14:45.541
I just need to look
at that dang group photo again.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.051
The photo,

14:47.128 --> 14:48.628
-the letters-- they're gone!
-(gasping)

14:48.704 --> 14:50.129
Okay, that<i> is</i> odd.

14:50.206 --> 14:51.222
What the heck?

14:51.299 --> 14:53.174
Now I<i> really</i> need a ginger ale.

14:53.250 --> 14:54.726
Antonio, make it a double!

14:59.140 --> 15:00.723
So, someone took my photo?

15:00.734 --> 15:02.400
And Roger's letters?
Why?

15:02.477 --> 15:03.726
Maybe it was Ken Burns.

15:03.737 --> 15:05.311
He loves old photos and letters.

15:05.388 --> 15:06.812
Guess what, people, you mess

15:06.889 --> 15:09.073
with the snail head,
you mess with the snail tail.

15:09.150 --> 15:11.400
And now the snail tail
wants some answers.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.361
Thanks, Louise.
Maybe someone didn't want us

15:13.413 --> 15:14.637
to find out the truth,

15:14.639 --> 15:16.906
didn't want Dolores
to stop coming around.

15:16.917 --> 15:17.916
Yeah, maybe someone
who wanted Dolores

15:17.992 --> 15:20.201
to keep trying
to conjure up Roger

15:20.277 --> 15:22.536
so they could say
they saw a ghost and take

15:22.613 --> 15:23.704
-a picture.
-Huh?

15:23.781 --> 15:25.706
-Or was it you, Gus?
-Oh, my!

15:25.783 --> 15:27.208
Maybe you don't want Dolores
to stop coming in here

15:27.284 --> 15:28.376
'cause maybe you have
a little crush.

15:28.452 --> 15:30.503
What? Oh, I'm-I'm blushing.

15:30.579 --> 15:31.930
But I didn't take anything.

15:32.006 --> 15:33.589
Maybe it was that guy.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.925
What?
I'm on my way to a party.

15:35.936 --> 15:38.010
I only came in to use
the little bees' room.

15:38.087 --> 15:39.762
I did.
It went great.

15:39.773 --> 15:41.088
I'm glad those aren't real bees.

15:41.166 --> 15:44.058
'Cause if I got stung,
I'd "bee" in the hospital.

15:44.135 --> 15:46.018
With anaphylactic shock.
(chuckles)

15:46.095 --> 15:47.111
I'm seriously allergic.

15:47.188 --> 15:48.938
And bathrooms are
for customers only.

15:48.949 --> 15:51.115
-Next time. Can't undo it.
-Wait a minute.

15:51.192 --> 15:53.618
Maybe it was<i> you,</i> Mr. Manager.

15:53.695 --> 15:55.695
-(yelps)
-You get more business

15:55.771 --> 15:58.114
if Dolores keeps coming here
year after year.

15:58.124 --> 15:59.457
(gasps)
That's true.

15:59.534 --> 16:01.617
-Of course.
-It wasn't me.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.869
Sure, Dolores brings
a Halloween bump in business,

16:03.946 --> 16:06.673
but that doesn't mean
I'd mess with your totally

16:06.708 --> 16:09.041
not annoying investigation
to keep people coming here.

16:09.118 --> 16:11.585
Aah! Well, no one leaves
until we figure this out.

16:11.662 --> 16:12.545
I'm leaving.

16:12.621 --> 16:14.046
Oh, yeah, you can go.

16:14.123 --> 16:15.974

16:50.084 --> 16:52.010
No! No, I'm not.

(screams)

17:10.179 --> 17:11.771
(gurgles)

17:11.847 --> 17:13.522
Okay, let's run through
what happened.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.983
Roger caught peanuts in
his mouth, which is very cool.

17:16.060 --> 17:17.943
-And sexy.
-It's okay.

17:18.020 --> 17:19.153
He then leaves you
to go get drinks.

17:19.230 --> 17:20.479
The next thing we know,

17:20.557 --> 17:22.948
he's seen by the elevator
with I Dream of Jeannie?

17:23.025 --> 17:25.326
And in the morning, he's found
dead of cardiac arrest.

17:25.402 --> 17:26.702
Huh. Peanuts.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.329
Drinks.
Cardiac arrest.

17:28.405 --> 17:29.881
I still think
the bee guy did it.

17:29.957 --> 17:31.457
-(gasps) That's it!
-I'm right?!

17:31.534 --> 17:32.708
-No!
-(grumbles)

17:32.719 --> 17:33.885
Anaphylactic shock!

17:33.961 --> 17:34.794
<i> He's</i> allergic to bees.

17:34.870 --> 17:36.837
Roger was allergic to peanuts!

17:36.914 --> 17:38.839
Think about it. Their date
at the Thai restaurant.

17:38.916 --> 17:40.341
He came down with a sudden cold?

17:40.417 --> 17:41.842
Thai food is super peanut-y.

17:41.919 --> 17:43.561
And the night he died,
he was eating nuts.

17:43.638 --> 17:44.937
But he died of a heart attack.

17:44.972 --> 17:47.223
Well, maybe an allergic reaction
can cause that?

17:47.233 --> 17:49.100
It can.
Oh, baby, it can.

17:49.176 --> 17:50.551
If he was allergic,

17:50.628 --> 17:52.978
why was he catching
all those peanuts in his mouth?

17:53.055 --> 17:55.731
Really showboating,
getting me all worked up.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.316
Well, he probably
didn't realize it.

17:57.393 --> 17:59.235
Allergies can come on
later in life.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.904
When I was in my 20s,
I was all about bees.

18:01.915 --> 18:03.748
I used to catch 'em
and shake 'em.

18:03.825 --> 18:05.741
But that still doesn't explain

18:05.752 --> 18:07.827
why Roger went upstairs
with I Dream of Jeannie.

18:07.903 --> 18:09.253
Which is why I want to look

18:09.330 --> 18:10.755
at the group photo
that someone stole.

18:10.832 --> 18:13.666
-And that someone is Dolores!
-(gasping)

18:13.742 --> 18:15.835
But, but how did you know?

18:15.911 --> 18:16.986
It was a hunch.

18:16.988 --> 18:17.920
And then I saw the photo
sticking out

18:17.931 --> 18:18.838
of the back of your pants.

18:18.914 --> 18:20.256
Oh. You can see this?

18:20.266 --> 18:22.716
Wait, you took the photo
and the letters?

18:22.793 --> 18:25.719
Yes. And it's my own
damn business<i> why</i> I did it.

18:25.796 --> 18:26.679
TINA:
I Dream of Jeannie.

18:26.755 --> 18:27.847
She's the final piece.

18:27.923 --> 18:29.107
Who was she?

18:29.183 --> 18:30.891
Or, possibly, who was "he"?

18:30.968 --> 18:32.226
-Huh?
-Look.

18:32.303 --> 18:34.612
That's an Adam's apple
that we didn't notice

18:34.689 --> 18:36.021
'cause someone stole the photo.

18:36.098 --> 18:38.116
And knuckle hair
that looks like shag carpet.

18:38.234 --> 18:39.283
And why's he wearing a pager?

18:39.360 --> 18:40.860
(gasps)
That thing's a pager?

18:40.936 --> 18:43.237
GUS:
Yeah. That's how pagers
looked back then.

18:43.314 --> 18:45.281
I had one
when I owned this town.

18:45.291 --> 18:46.866
This was all my turf.

18:46.942 --> 18:47.783
I was untouchable.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.627
They called me Payday. I--

18:49.704 --> 18:52.037
I mean,
when I was a-a bike messenger.

18:52.114 --> 18:53.798
I bet I Dream of Jeannie
was a doctor.

18:53.875 --> 18:55.133
They used to have male doctors.

18:55.209 --> 18:56.634
And I bet he was helping Roger,

18:56.711 --> 18:58.627
because Roger was having
an allergic reaction.

18:58.680 --> 19:01.380
Tina, I think your stupid story
might be right.

19:01.457 --> 19:03.307
<i> Roger ate some peanuts,</i>
<i> started getting symptoms.</i>

19:03.384 --> 19:04.717
<i> TINA:</i>
<i> He goes to the bar.</i>

19:04.793 --> 19:05.643
<i> He's sweaty, woozy.</i>

19:05.720 --> 19:07.002
<i> And Dr. Jeannie-Man notices</i>

19:07.004 --> 19:09.221
<i> and says maybe he needs</i>
<i> to lie down, so...</i>

19:09.298 --> 19:11.307
<i> LOUISE:</i>
<i> He helps Roger to the elevatr</i>
<i> so he can go to his room</i>

19:11.317 --> 19:12.633
and get some rest.

19:12.710 --> 19:14.310
Maybe they didn't know
about peanut allergies.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.154
Male doctors probably weren't
that good back then.

19:16.230 --> 19:17.989
My poor Roger.

19:18.065 --> 19:19.899
He didn't cheat on me.

19:19.975 --> 19:21.817
At least he died
doing what he loved,

19:21.828 --> 19:24.662
eating peanuts in a hotel lobby.

19:24.739 --> 19:26.664
(laughs)
You full-bottom-ists.

19:26.741 --> 19:28.666
-You're a hoot!
-It's "phlebotomist."

19:28.743 --> 19:30.001
-What did I say?
-Well, uh,

19:30.077 --> 19:31.744
Bob should be about finished.

19:31.820 --> 19:33.662
Oh, no.
Oh, no, no, no, no.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.456
What? What-what is it?

19:35.532 --> 19:37.082
-(woozy groaning)
-Oh, crap.

19:37.159 --> 19:39.010
Here, let me, uh,
clean you up a little bit.

19:39.086 --> 19:40.794
And I'll give you extra cookies

19:40.871 --> 19:42.129
if you don't tell anybody
about this.

19:42.206 --> 19:43.422
(weakly):
Huh. Okay.

19:43.499 --> 19:44.348
That's fair.

19:44.425 --> 19:45.466
Congratulations, Bob.

19:45.542 --> 19:47.092
You donated blood one time.

19:47.169 --> 19:48.677
Come on, let's hear it for Bob!

19:48.688 --> 19:50.179
-Everybody!
-(mouth full): I did it.

19:50.190 --> 19:52.690
-Yes, you did.
-I can do anything.

19:52.767 --> 19:55.434
I saved<i> your</i> life!
I saved<i> your</i> life!

19:55.511 --> 19:57.102
I-I got to sit down.

19:57.179 --> 20:00.314
So why<i> did</i> you take the photo
and the letters, Dolores?

20:00.391 --> 20:03.150
Oh, I was having a cocktail
at the bar.

20:03.227 --> 20:05.369
<i> I needed</i>
<i> a little conjuring break.</i>

20:05.446 --> 20:08.197
<i> And I overheard you talking</i>
<i> and I suddenly thought,</i>

20:08.208 --> 20:09.874
<i> "What if this was all just</i>
<i> a huge waste of time?</i>

20:09.951 --> 20:11.542
What if she's right?"

20:11.619 --> 20:12.534
And she was.

20:12.545 --> 20:13.535
About you.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.120
And maybe about me, too.

20:15.197 --> 20:16.872
I feel like a fool.

20:16.883 --> 20:18.040
Makes sense.
Sorry.

20:18.051 --> 20:20.876
Roger, I'm so sorry.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.887
I mean, it's sorta romantic.

20:22.964 --> 20:24.505
In your own twisted way,

20:24.581 --> 20:25.881
you loved Roger so much

20:25.892 --> 20:28.717
that you kept this thing going
for 50 years.

20:28.728 --> 20:29.635
A-And just to put this
out there,

20:29.712 --> 20:31.512
Gus might still be in the lobby.

20:31.588 --> 20:33.472
-Not a bad rebound guy.
-Hmm.

20:33.549 --> 20:34.974
I'd like to see<i> that</i> guy
catch a nut.

20:35.050 --> 20:36.091
(wind hissing)

20:36.093 --> 20:38.402
Oh, now you decide to come,
Roger?

20:38.479 --> 20:40.646
-Whoa.
-Someone's jealous.

20:40.723 --> 20:41.981
So I guess this means
I lose our bet

20:42.057 --> 20:43.482
and we won't do my amazing plan?

20:43.559 --> 20:45.401
Yep.
Just treats, no tricks.

20:45.411 --> 20:46.911
-Let's get out there, huh?
-Sure, sure, sure.

20:46.988 --> 20:48.570
But what if we go to that house,

20:48.581 --> 20:50.581
we totally just get candy
normally,

20:50.658 --> 20:53.075
and we open the fart hatch
and Gene does a little fart?

20:53.086 --> 20:55.369
-Nope.
-Okay, so I just fart
inside the snail

20:55.446 --> 20:56.704
and we all die like Roger?

20:56.780 --> 20:59.498
