WEBVTT

00:02.202 --> 00:03.878
It's amazing
people keep coming

00:03.879 --> 00:05.278
to comic book stores

00:05.280 --> 00:08.413
instead of just downloading
comics digitally.

00:08.415 --> 00:09.913
It's probably for the best.

00:09.915 --> 00:11.980
For a lot of these guys,
the weekly trip here

00:11.982 --> 00:14.080
is the only chance
their mom has to go down

00:14.082 --> 00:16.047
to the basement
and change their sheets.

00:17.148 --> 00:20.847
Oh, that reminds me,
I get fresh sheets tonight. Yay.

00:22.949 --> 00:24.515
Well?

00:24.517 --> 00:26.415
What do you think
of New Comic Book Night?

00:26.417 --> 00:28.916
Magic, huh?

00:28.918 --> 00:30.817
Sheldon, I'm disappointed.

00:30.819 --> 00:32.018
As a brilliant man,

00:32.020 --> 00:33.152
you're entitled to a vice.

00:33.154 --> 00:34.820
I could understand
frequenting an opium den

00:34.822 --> 00:37.156
or hunting your fellow man
for sport.

00:38.258 --> 00:41.725
But this? Lame-o.

00:42.627 --> 00:44.860
Well, A) Comic books
employ storytelling

00:44.862 --> 00:46.128
through sequential art,

00:46.130 --> 00:48.263
an medium that dates back
17,000 years

00:48.265 --> 00:50.231
to the cave paintings
of Lascaux,

00:50.233 --> 00:52.533
and B) You play the harp.

00:52.535 --> 00:54.067
Like that's cool.

00:57.237 --> 00:59.604
Can I help you
find anything?

00:59.606 --> 01:01.705
A comic that depicts
a woman whose bosom

01:01.707 --> 01:03.907
can't be used
as a flotation device.

01:04.709 --> 01:06.209
Sorry. Most of the guys

01:06.211 --> 01:08.411
who come in here
like big boobs.

01:08.413 --> 01:10.679
Couple of them
have big boobs.

01:12.015 --> 01:13.215
Hey, look, the new

01:13.217 --> 01:15.316
Warlords of Ka'a
expansion pack is out.

01:15.318 --> 01:17.484
A new one?
Unbelievable.

01:17.486 --> 01:19.786
They just keep making up
more cheesy monsters,

01:19.788 --> 01:23.189
slapping them on cards and
selling them at 25 bucks a pop.

01:23.191 --> 01:26.924
It's like a secret tax
on guys who can't get laid.

01:27.825 --> 01:28.992
They're not even trying.

01:28.994 --> 01:31.194
Remember the Satanimals pack
with the Hellephant?

01:31.196 --> 01:32.528
Why, absurd.

01:32.530 --> 01:34.963
What was he, a bad elephant
who died and went to hell?

01:34.965 --> 01:36.397
What could
an elephant

01:36.399 --> 01:39.732
possibly do that would cause him
eternal damnation?

01:39.734 --> 01:41.433
"Wild West and Witches"?

01:41.435 --> 01:44.535
What kind of loser cares
about a showdown

01:44.537 --> 01:48.471
between Billy the Kid and
the White Wizard of the North?

01:48.473 --> 01:49.973
A total loser.

01:49.975 --> 01:52.008
Obviously,
a guy with a six-shooter

01:52.010 --> 01:54.043
beats an old man
with a magic wand.

01:55.579 --> 01:57.312
Well, h-hold on.

01:58.381 --> 02:00.182
Uh, what if the wizard casts

02:00.184 --> 02:03.451
a Helmet of Confusion spell
on Billy the Kid's cowboy hat?

02:03.453 --> 02:04.852
What? Please!

02:04.854 --> 02:06.520
This is Billy the Kid
we're talking about.

02:06.522 --> 02:08.554
I mean, the wizard
would get shot between the eyes

02:08.556 --> 02:10.155
before he could ever
get out the words,

02:10.157 --> 02:11.857
"What the hell
is Billy the Kid doing

02:11.859 --> 02:14.225
in the mystic realm of Ka'a?"

02:14.227 --> 02:16.027
Leonard...
(clears throat)

02:16.029 --> 02:19.096
What's the deal
with Sheldon's friend Amy?

02:19.098 --> 02:20.263
Are they a couple?

02:20.265 --> 02:22.598
Couple of weirdos. Why?

02:22.600 --> 02:24.433
You interested in Amy?

02:24.435 --> 02:27.134
Well, I mean,
she didn't look through me

02:27.136 --> 02:28.969
with soul-sucking,
ball-shriveling

02:28.971 --> 02:31.571
hatred and contempt.

02:31.573 --> 02:33.607
I like that in a woman.

02:34.675 --> 02:36.943
Could you run it by Sheldon
if I could ask her out?

02:36.945 --> 02:38.378
Sure. I guess.

02:38.380 --> 02:40.079
KOOTHRAPPALI: Stuart, settle an
argument for us.

02:40.081 --> 02:41.579
Who would win,

02:41.581 --> 02:43.915
Billy the Kid
or the White Wizard?

02:43.917 --> 02:45.883
(chuckles)
If I tell you that,

02:45.885 --> 02:49.119
I'm robbing you of the hours
of fun you could have

02:49.121 --> 02:54.591
for the magical, rootin'-tootin'
low price of $24.95.

02:55.426 --> 02:56.926
I'll take one.

02:56.928 --> 02:58.361
Mm... make it two.

02:58.363 --> 03:01.264
I hate all of you and myself.
Three.

03:02.299 --> 03:04.266
I'll ring it up.

03:04.268 --> 03:07.036

03:35.284 --> 03:36.972
Hey, can I talk to
you about something?

03:36.973 --> 03:39.607
It's a little
awkward.

03:39.609 --> 03:41.743
I know what this is about.

03:41.745 --> 03:44.313
Given the professional
standstill you're at,

03:44.315 --> 03:47.115
you're wondering
if this is the appropriate time

03:47.117 --> 03:50.452
to abandon your research
and focus on teaching.

03:53.156 --> 03:55.424
Yes.

03:57.261 --> 03:59.029
And if I may suggest,

03:59.031 --> 04:00.597
consider changing disciplines.

04:00.599 --> 04:02.833
Yeah, to the humanities--
perhaps history.

04:02.835 --> 04:05.269
One of the advantages
of teaching history

04:05.271 --> 04:08.039
is that you don't have
to create things.

04:08.041 --> 04:10.141
You know, you just
have to remember

04:10.143 --> 04:12.977
stuff that happened
and then parrot it back.

04:12.979 --> 04:15.614
You could have fun with that.

04:16.449 --> 04:18.216
Yeah, that's not it.

04:18.218 --> 04:20.685
Stuart's kind of
interested in Amy.

04:20.687 --> 04:23.087
Oh, of course he is.
She's very interesting.

04:23.089 --> 04:25.190
Did you know,
when she was 14,

04:25.192 --> 04:28.159
she severed the webbing
between her own toes?

04:29.562 --> 04:32.063
No.

04:32.065 --> 04:34.031
He wanted me to find out

04:34.033 --> 04:37.368
if you'd have a problem
with him asking her out.

04:38.971 --> 04:42.139
I'm not sure how to respond,
Leonard.

04:42.141 --> 04:44.375
I don't own Amy.

04:44.377 --> 04:47.011
Can't own a person.

04:47.013 --> 04:49.880
At least not since...

04:53.819 --> 04:56.188
1863.

04:57.724 --> 05:00.392
President Lincoln freed the...

05:01.561 --> 05:04.196
Slaves!
Come on, Leonard,

05:04.198 --> 05:05.530
if you're going
to teach history,

05:05.532 --> 05:07.966
these are the kind of facts
you'll have to know.

05:07.968 --> 05:09.601
You know what?
Never mind.

05:09.603 --> 05:12.137
I'm going to tell him
it's okay to ask her out.

05:12.139 --> 05:13.438
The question is moot.

05:13.440 --> 05:15.273
There is no way that Stuart,

05:15.275 --> 05:17.409
an impoverished peddler
of picture books,

05:17.411 --> 05:20.145
would be at all appealing
to Amy Farrah Fowler,

05:20.147 --> 05:22.213
a noted neurobiologist

05:22.215 --> 05:24.982
capable of performing surgery
on her own feet

05:24.984 --> 05:26.651
with nothing but nitrous oxide

05:26.653 --> 05:29.487
from cans of whipped cream
as anesthesia.

05:30.355 --> 05:32.490
All right,
but for the record,

05:32.492 --> 05:35.326
I checked in with you
to see how you'd feel about it.

05:35.328 --> 05:37.862
Fine.
The record shall so reflect.

05:37.864 --> 05:40.531
Now, getting back
to the problem at hand,

05:40.533 --> 05:44.035
what to do with a washed-up
experimental physicist...

05:45.937 --> 05:48.038
I am not washed-up.

05:48.040 --> 05:49.974
Oh, Leonard.

05:49.976 --> 05:53.310
Lots of people love you
and want to help you,

05:53.312 --> 05:56.614
but they can't
until you admit the problem.

05:59.217 --> 06:02.053
Well, ladies,
we killed the bottle.

06:02.055 --> 06:03.354
I had half a glass.

06:03.356 --> 06:04.956
I didn't have any.

06:04.958 --> 06:06.992
Okay, don't judge me.

06:08.295 --> 06:09.929
So, what do you want to do--

06:09.931 --> 06:13.332
go to the movies, go dancing,
lay down for a little bit?

06:14.767 --> 06:18.671
Or we play... Travel Twister.

06:19.539 --> 06:21.874
Amy, really? Twister?

06:21.876 --> 06:23.309
Excuse me.
I've passed many

06:23.311 --> 06:24.943
an enjoyable evening
playing this game.

06:24.945 --> 06:26.745
And I'm sure it's
a lot more exciting

06:26.747 --> 06:28.947
when you play with other people.

06:30.250 --> 06:32.551
What do you say, bestie?
We can do shirts and skins.

06:32.553 --> 06:34.019
I'm shirts. Called it.

06:34.021 --> 06:36.088
(cell phone buzzing)

06:37.456 --> 06:39.090
I'm too small
for Twister.

06:39.092 --> 06:40.391
And roller coasters.

06:40.393 --> 06:43.160
And sitting with my
feet on the floor.

06:44.162 --> 06:47.664
Hope you enjoyed the
prenatal cigarettes, Mom.

06:50.301 --> 06:51.868
Hey, you know, my mom smoked pot

06:51.870 --> 06:54.704
when she was pregnant with me,
and I turned out just fine.

06:54.706 --> 06:56.072
Hey, look, I have
peach schnapps.

06:56.074 --> 06:57.841
Thank God.

06:58.676 --> 07:00.443
Guys, something happened.

07:00.445 --> 07:01.478
What's wrong?

07:01.480 --> 07:03.881
I think a boy
likes me.

07:05.116 --> 07:06.616
"Hi. It's Stuart.

07:06.618 --> 07:08.719
"We met at the
comic book store.

07:08.721 --> 07:09.954
"I was wondering
if you'd like

07:09.956 --> 07:10.988
"to get coffee sometime.

07:10.990 --> 07:12.390
"It's okay
if you say no.

07:12.392 --> 07:14.592
"It might be the kick
in the pants I need

07:14.594 --> 07:16.861
to start taking Zoloft."

07:18.364 --> 07:20.032
Amy, little vixen.

07:20.034 --> 07:23.502
Just working it under all those
layers of wool and polyester.

07:24.371 --> 07:26.339
What are you going to do?

07:26.341 --> 07:27.874
Doesn't he know
you have a boyfriend?

07:27.876 --> 07:29.476
Oh, she doesn't
have a boyfriend;

07:29.478 --> 07:31.311
she has a Sheldon.

07:31.313 --> 07:33.480
So do you
like Stuart?

07:33.482 --> 07:34.848
I don't know.

07:34.850 --> 07:36.149
He's nice.

07:36.151 --> 07:37.250
He's funny.

07:37.252 --> 07:38.852
He has the sallow,
drawn countenance

07:38.854 --> 07:40.854
associated with an overactive
thyroid gland.

07:40.856 --> 07:42.722
That's kind of hot.

07:43.557 --> 07:45.558
Okay, look, sweetie,
we all love Sheldon,

07:45.560 --> 07:47.559
but you've been with him
over a year now.

07:47.561 --> 07:48.627
If it's not going anywhere,

07:48.629 --> 07:50.062
what does it hurt
to look around?

07:50.064 --> 07:51.830
Well, yeah, I guess
they're not engaged

07:51.832 --> 07:53.598
like me and Howie.

07:53.600 --> 07:54.666
Yeah, for what it's worth,

07:54.668 --> 07:56.001
engaged people
can look around, too.

07:56.003 --> 07:57.335
Lot of options out there.

08:06.913 --> 08:08.447
Where's Stuart?

08:08.449 --> 08:09.647
(giggles)

08:09.649 --> 08:11.315
Out.

08:12.651 --> 08:13.951
Who are you?

08:13.953 --> 08:15.119
I'm Dale.

08:15.121 --> 08:17.321
He left me in charge.

08:19.158 --> 08:20.591
Really?

08:20.593 --> 08:21.960
Yeah.

08:21.962 --> 08:24.128
I don't get it, either.

08:26.232 --> 08:29.534
I want to return
this "Wild West and Witches"

08:29.536 --> 08:31.269
Ka'a expansion pack.

08:31.271 --> 08:33.138
Sorry. I don't do returns.

08:33.140 --> 08:35.341
They're hard.

08:36.208 --> 08:38.111
Sure, sure.

08:39.080 --> 08:40.746
Uh, when will
Stuart be back?

08:40.749 --> 08:42.616
I don't know.
He went out for coffee.

08:42.618 --> 08:43.918
With a girl.

08:43.919 --> 08:46.654
(high-pitched giggling)

08:46.656 --> 08:48.990
Oh, I guess I was wrong.

08:49.825 --> 08:51.326
You okay?

08:52.161 --> 08:53.628
Am I okay?

08:53.630 --> 08:55.897
Leonard,
I'm on a lifelong trajectory

08:55.899 --> 08:58.967
that includes a Nobel Prize
and cities named after me,

08:58.969 --> 09:00.368
all four
wisdom teeth

09:00.370 --> 09:02.637
fit comfortably in my mouth
without need of extraction,

09:02.639 --> 09:06.174
and my bowel movements run
like a German train schedule.

09:08.510 --> 09:10.711
Am I okay?

09:11.646 --> 09:13.213
I'm okay, too!

09:22.445 --> 09:25.414
Wild Bill Witchcock.

09:27.383 --> 09:30.319
A tribe of Abra-Comanches.

09:35.126 --> 09:37.494
Flaming Spittoon.

09:37.496 --> 09:38.896
And for the record,

09:38.898 --> 09:40.664
I'm very disappointed
in you cowpokes.

09:40.666 --> 09:42.633
We're playing
our inaugural round

09:42.635 --> 09:44.469
of "Wild West and Witches,"

09:44.471 --> 09:46.038
and I'm the only one
who bothered

09:46.040 --> 09:48.006
to dress for the occasion.

09:48.008 --> 09:49.775
(spits) Patooie.

09:50.810 --> 09:53.111
We're not wearing
cowboy hats, Sheldon.

09:53.113 --> 09:54.579
It looks ridiculous.

09:54.581 --> 09:58.849
And I suppose my boots and spurs
are ridiculous, too?

09:58.851 --> 10:01.285
- Yeah. - Very. - Incredibly so.

10:01.287 --> 10:04.922
Did it look ridiculous
when we got the Satanimals pack

10:04.924 --> 10:08.592
and I dressed up
as a Beelzebobcat?

10:08.594 --> 10:10.560
- Yeah. - Very. - Incredibly so.

10:12.096 --> 10:13.963
All right, fine.
Let's just play.

10:13.965 --> 10:15.632
We should go easy on him.

10:15.634 --> 10:17.434
Amy's out with Stuart tonight.

10:17.436 --> 10:18.702
Wait a minute.

10:18.704 --> 10:21.672
Are you telling me
that Sheldon's patented blend

10:21.674 --> 10:23.807
of condescension and no sex

10:23.809 --> 10:26.377
isn't enough
to hold on to a woman?

10:30.315 --> 10:31.348
Cluck, cluck, cluck.

10:31.350 --> 10:32.716
What are we,
ladies at a quilting bee?

10:32.718 --> 10:35.753
Or are we men
playing a fantasy card game

10:35.755 --> 10:38.555
set in a magical frontier town?

10:39.757 --> 10:41.658
Sorry.

10:41.660 --> 10:44.294
Creepy Tepee.

10:45.329 --> 10:47.863
Annie Ogly.

10:50.300 --> 10:53.035
Hocus Pocus Pocahontas.

10:53.037 --> 10:55.837
And may I point out
it is the three of you

10:55.839 --> 10:58.273
who are obsessed with
Stuart and Amy, not me.

10:58.275 --> 10:59.874
I think you need
to ask yourselves

10:59.876 --> 11:02.010
who's really being
ridiculous here.

11:02.845 --> 11:05.046
(spurs jingling & jangling)

11:10.385 --> 11:12.520
- It's you. - You are. - Totally you.

11:15.023 --> 11:16.256
Hey, guys, check it out.

11:16.258 --> 11:18.358
The deluxe limited edition
"Wild West and Witches"

11:18.360 --> 11:21.895
expansion pack in the signed
and numbered collector's tin.

11:21.897 --> 11:23.363
LEONARD:
Come on, no!

11:23.365 --> 11:25.932
We just bought the regular pack.

11:25.934 --> 11:27.300
Ooh, a sheriff's badge.

11:27.302 --> 11:29.068
(chuckles)

11:29.070 --> 11:31.037
Yeah, it's also a wand.

11:32.841 --> 11:36.043
With a hologram? Nice!

11:36.045 --> 11:37.478
Hey, do you see this?

11:37.480 --> 11:40.114
I'm in the matrix, Leonard;
I see everything.

11:40.116 --> 11:42.049
You got to be
kidding me.

11:42.051 --> 11:44.151
You friended Stuart
on Facebook?

11:44.153 --> 11:46.020
I thought you didn't
like Facebook anymore.

11:46.022 --> 11:47.455
Don't be silly.

11:47.457 --> 11:50.725
I'm a fan of anything that tries
to replace actual human contact.

11:50.727 --> 11:53.194
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Please.

11:53.196 --> 11:55.731
You're looking at Facebook
to find out how their date went.

11:55.733 --> 11:57.099
Really?

11:57.101 --> 11:58.734
You think I care if a man, what,

11:58.736 --> 12:02.671
"shared a pumpkin latte
with a dynamite lady"?

12:02.673 --> 12:03.772
You're so full of it.

12:03.774 --> 12:05.207
You are free to believe

12:05.209 --> 12:07.342
whatever you like.

12:07.344 --> 12:10.646
And unfriend
Rajesh Koothrappali.

12:10.648 --> 12:12.214
You unfriended me? Seriously?

12:12.216 --> 12:13.516
Oh, yeah.

12:13.518 --> 12:15.418
Now he's gonna miss all
those great updates like,

12:15.420 --> 12:17.120
"I can't believe
I waited this long

12:17.122 --> 12:19.222
(Indian accent):
to make my own potpourri""

12:20.625 --> 12:22.226
Sheldon, why don't you
just acknowledge

12:22.228 --> 12:23.494
that you have feelings for Amy

12:23.496 --> 12:25.763
and you don't want her
going out with other men?

12:25.765 --> 12:29.533
And unfriend
Leonard Hofstadter.

12:29.535 --> 12:30.634
Here's a radical thought.

12:30.636 --> 12:33.003
Go old-school,
challenge Stuart to a fight.

12:33.005 --> 12:34.638
I mean, nothing makes
the ladies hotter

12:34.640 --> 12:36.540
than two skinny white guys

12:36.542 --> 12:38.942
swatting at each other
with their eyes closed.

12:41.345 --> 12:43.546
And unfriend Howard Wolowitz.

12:44.448 --> 12:45.414
That's all of us.

12:45.416 --> 12:47.316
- Can I use the laptop?
- Why?

12:47.318 --> 12:51.220
I have to buy that
stupid collector's tin.

12:52.322 --> 12:54.323
PENNY: Who do we love?
Penny.

12:54.325 --> 12:55.825
Who do we love?
Penny.

12:55.827 --> 12:58.394
Who do we love?
Penny.

12:58.396 --> 13:00.129
Hello, Sheldon.

13:00.131 --> 13:01.364
Come on in.

13:01.366 --> 13:02.732
Thank you.

13:02.734 --> 13:04.534
What's up?

13:04.536 --> 13:08.337
I came to ask if you would like
to go on a date with me.

13:10.173 --> 13:12.241
I'm sorry, what?

13:12.243 --> 13:13.509
A date.

13:13.511 --> 13:14.677
You and me.

13:14.679 --> 13:16.279
Dining, dancing,

13:16.281 --> 13:19.316
perhaps you'd like to
take in a prizefight.

13:19.318 --> 13:20.384
(microwave beeps)

13:20.386 --> 13:23.254
God, are you trying
to make Amy jealous?

13:23.256 --> 13:24.455
No.

13:24.457 --> 13:27.458
Why is everyone so obsessed
with Amy and Stuart?

13:27.460 --> 13:29.793
Whether or not they may be
having more pumpkin lattes

13:29.795 --> 13:31.762
or intercourse tonight.

13:31.764 --> 13:34.397
Okay, listen to me.

13:34.399 --> 13:37.468
Playing games is not
gonna help get Amy back.

13:37.470 --> 13:39.603
I am not trying to get her back.

13:39.605 --> 13:42.906
But, out of curiosity,
what is a way?

13:42.908 --> 13:44.975
All right, honey,
let me tell you a story.

13:44.977 --> 13:48.145
There was a guy I liked,
and I never told him how I felt.

13:48.147 --> 13:50.313
Eventually, he started
going out with someone else,

13:50.315 --> 13:52.249
and I always regretted it.

13:52.251 --> 13:54.485
Do you see
where I'm going with this?

13:54.487 --> 13:56.120
I believe I do.

13:56.122 --> 13:57.355
Mm.

13:57.357 --> 13:59.491
I'm the guy.

14:02.695 --> 14:04.195
You're not the guy.

14:04.197 --> 14:06.131
Are you sure?

14:06.133 --> 14:07.932
That would explain so much.

14:07.934 --> 14:10.535
Your constant presence
in my apartment,

14:10.537 --> 14:13.338
that baffling dalliance
with Leonard just to be near me,

14:13.340 --> 14:14.573
the way you call me

14:14.575 --> 14:16.641
"sweetie" all the time.

14:16.643 --> 14:17.976
I call everyone "sweetie."

14:17.978 --> 14:18.876
You tramp.

14:18.878 --> 14:20.545
(sighs)

14:22.180 --> 14:23.547
Look, Sheldon,
all I'm saying is

14:23.549 --> 14:25.649
strap on a pair
and go talk to Amy.

14:25.651 --> 14:27.685
"Strap on a pair"?

14:27.687 --> 14:30.522
Of what, skates?

14:32.158 --> 14:35.026
Oh, sweetie,
you are so not the guy.

14:37.497 --> 14:40.032
(quiet, dramatic musical score
playing in movie)

14:41.835 --> 14:43.703
If you're bored,
you can go.

14:43.705 --> 14:46.339
I understand.

14:46.341 --> 14:49.009
No, I'm having a nice time.

14:49.011 --> 14:49.976
(scoffs)

14:49.978 --> 14:52.312
Don't patronize me.

14:54.181 --> 14:55.548
Excuse me. Excuse me.

14:55.550 --> 14:56.716
Pardon me.

14:57.652 --> 14:59.218
Pardon me. Excuse me.

14:59.220 --> 15:00.253
Hi, Stuart.

15:00.255 --> 15:01.053
Hi, Sheldon.

15:01.055 --> 15:03.089
Pardon me... Excuse me...

15:07.994 --> 15:10.062
Sheldon, what are
you doing here?

15:10.064 --> 15:12.866
The thought of you
sitting in a darkened theater

15:12.868 --> 15:16.236
with a character
like Stuart is repellent.

15:17.672 --> 15:19.507
No offense, Stuart.

15:19.509 --> 15:20.942
None taken.

15:20.944 --> 15:24.279
Although "repellent" is kind
of a... kind of a strong word.

15:28.118 --> 15:30.920
I'm sorry this causes
you discomfort,

15:30.922 --> 15:33.322
but based on the currently
established parameters

15:33.324 --> 15:35.325
of our relationship,
I can put myself

15:35.327 --> 15:37.127
in any repellent
situation I want.

15:37.129 --> 15:38.962
Um, again...

15:38.964 --> 15:41.298
Stuart, please.
You're being rude.

15:43.435 --> 15:45.870
Anything else?

15:45.872 --> 15:49.506
I believe I would
like to alter

15:49.508 --> 15:52.276
the paradigm
of our relationship.

15:54.112 --> 15:55.979
I'm listening.

15:55.981 --> 16:00.817
With the understanding
that nothing changes whatsoever,

16:00.819 --> 16:02.686
physical or otherwise,

16:02.688 --> 16:05.189
I would not object to us

16:05.191 --> 16:10.527
no longer characterizing you
as "not my girlfriend."

16:16.134 --> 16:18.501
Interesting.

16:18.503 --> 16:21.671
Now try it without the
quadruple negative.

16:21.673 --> 16:25.041
You're being impossible.

16:25.043 --> 16:27.243
Hi, Stuart.

16:29.146 --> 16:32.148
Fine.

16:32.150 --> 16:35.719
Amy...

16:35.721 --> 16:38.856
will you be my girlfriend?

16:45.231 --> 16:46.231
Yes.

16:46.233 --> 16:49.601
Well, that's enough
of that.

16:49.603 --> 16:51.103
Sorry to interrupt.

16:51.105 --> 16:53.005
You two enjoy your date.

16:53.007 --> 16:54.739
Here's a dollar
for your troubles.

16:54.741 --> 16:56.774
Get yourself
some Sour Patch Kids.

16:56.776 --> 16:58.643
Excuse me... Excuse me...
Pardon me...

16:58.645 --> 17:01.412
Excuse me.
Pardon me.

17:02.547 --> 17:06.450
So, other than you
taking your relationship

17:06.452 --> 17:10.686
to the next level with
another guy, this was nice.

17:12.457 --> 17:14.724
Yes, well, thanks for
seeing me to my door.

17:14.727 --> 17:16.093
Oh, you're welcome.

17:16.095 --> 17:19.930
(knocking)
SHELDON: Amy. Amy. Amy.

17:21.799 --> 17:25.236
Let's wrap things up out there.

17:28.306 --> 17:30.241
Um, good night, Stuart.

17:30.243 --> 17:31.241
Good night.

17:33.044 --> 17:34.712
SHELDON:
Take the hint, Stuart.

17:34.714 --> 17:36.980
The lady said
"Good night."

17:40.385 --> 17:42.519
How did you get
into my apartment?

17:42.521 --> 17:45.155
Wow. Is that the kind
of nagging I can expect

17:45.157 --> 17:46.856
now that you're my girlfriend?

17:48.459 --> 17:50.861
Good thing I drew this up.

17:50.863 --> 17:52.395
What's that?

17:52.397 --> 17:56.465
I present to you
the relationship agreement.

18:00.036 --> 18:02.771
A binding covenant that,
in its 31 pages,

18:02.773 --> 18:04.940
enumerates, iterates
and codifies

18:04.942 --> 18:07.843
the rights and responsibilities
of Sheldon Lee Cooper,

18:07.845 --> 18:09.845
here and after known
as "the boyfriend,"

18:09.847 --> 18:15.384
and Amy Farrah Fowler, here and
after known as "the girlfriend""

18:17.054 --> 18:20.423
It's so romantic.

18:20.425 --> 18:22.459
Mutual indemnification
always is.

18:25.931 --> 18:30.300
Why don't you start perusing
while I set up my notary stamp.

18:30.302 --> 18:33.636
"Section 5:
Hand-holding.

18:33.638 --> 18:35.071
"Hand-holding
is only allowed

18:35.073 --> 18:36.706
"under the following
circumstances.

18:36.708 --> 18:39.508
"A: Either party is in danger
of falling off a cliff,

18:39.510 --> 18:41.210
"precipice or ledge;

18:41.212 --> 18:43.745
"B: Either party is deserving
of a hearty handshake

18:43.747 --> 18:46.348
"after winning
a Nobel Prize;

18:46.350 --> 18:49.618
C: Moral support
during flu shots""

18:52.622 --> 18:54.123
Seems a bit
restrictive.

18:54.125 --> 18:56.125
Feel free to retain a lawyer.

19:08.578 --> 19:10.712
Penny, I said "right hand red."

19:10.714 --> 19:11.847
Yeah, I heard you.

19:11.849 --> 19:14.616
I got red.

19:14.618 --> 19:19.321
Bernadette, left
foot yellow.

19:19.323 --> 19:20.756
(groans)

19:20.758 --> 19:22.892
We should play limbo next.

19:22.894 --> 19:25.061
No one beats me at limbo.

19:26.130 --> 19:29.933
(knocking)
SHELDON: Penny. Amy. Bernadette.

19:32.104 --> 19:33.338
That's my boyfriend.

19:33.340 --> 19:34.705
It's open!

19:34.707 --> 19:37.274
I got a splinter.

19:37.276 --> 19:40.277
What do you want me
to do about it?

19:40.279 --> 19:43.414
Relationship agreement
Section 4: Boo-boos and Ouchies.

19:43.416 --> 19:45.115
You have to take care of it.

19:45.117 --> 19:47.317
I should've gotten a lawyer.

19:50.187 --> 19:52.922
Looks like it's just us playing.

19:52.924 --> 19:55.091
(snoring)

19:58.929 --> 20:01.598
Penny?

20:03.834 --> 20:05.102
Penny, we're out of wine!

20:05.104 --> 20:06.404
You should probably drive.
