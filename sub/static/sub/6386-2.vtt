00:07.803 --> 00:09.981
Previously on Californication.

00:10.009 --> 00:12.794
- My name's Hank.
- I know.

00:13.852 --> 00:16.385
This is Mia, Bill's daughter.
And this is Hank.

00:16.391 --> 00:18.808
- She's 16.
- 16.

00:18.953 --> 00:21.261
- Need to tell you something.
- Ok.

00:21.514 --> 00:22.966
it's not a memoir.

00:22.988 --> 00:25.451
It's a written account of my sexual
relationship with you.

00:25.472 --> 00:27.472
Written by me, as a fucking novel.

00:27.478 --> 00:31.090
The publishing world knows you as
this brilliant trainwreck.

00:31.111 --> 00:33.111
Let everyone else see.

00:33.117 --> 00:36.273
Abby here is the best there is at defending
the unjustly accused.

00:36.279 --> 00:38.141
- Hank Moody?
- Fuck. What now?

00:38.147 --> 00:40.147
You've been charged with statutory rape.

00:40.601 --> 00:42.259
I'm not going to sleep with you.

00:42.373 --> 00:43.919
- Hank.
- Mia.

00:43.940 --> 00:46.959
- Ok.
- Sasha Bingham is America's sweetheart.

00:46.965 --> 00:49.275
How about you rewrite the script
that I loathe?

00:50.254 --> 00:51.282
Let me handle this.

00:51.288 --> 00:53.350
You convince your client
to take this job,

00:53.356 --> 00:54.969
and you can have your old job back.

00:54.987 --> 00:58.461
When you had some notes...
you really had some fucking notes.

00:59.229 --> 01:01.329
How was it like? The punch.

01:01.430 --> 01:04.352
There's only one way to find out.
You wanna give it a shot?

02:04.558 --> 02:08.658
I couldn't sleep last night.
My mind was racing and that couch

02:08.675 --> 02:12.316
of yours is no fucking help, whatsoever.
it's like a medieval fucking torture device.

02:12.332 --> 02:15.592
- I was touching your penis, Hank.
- I know, Marce.

02:15.608 --> 02:17.671
Felt good too,
you give a nice tugjob.

02:17.792 --> 02:21.237
She does, doesn't she?
When she's motivated.

02:21.532 --> 02:23.225
It's a lost art really.

02:23.604 --> 02:26.708
Oh shit, I think I'm gonna puke!
Did you guys fuck?

02:26.740 --> 02:28.087
- Gross!
- Gross!

02:28.487 --> 02:30.749
Hey! What do you mean gross?

02:30.763 --> 02:34.116
Fuck you you fucking pedophile,
whats so gross about fucking me?

02:34.130 --> 02:37.489
Nothing, Marce. You know I'd throw
a shot into you. Anytime.

02:37.686 --> 02:40.217
- Oh Christ, make it stop.
- That's it!

02:40.302 --> 02:42.662
All you do is mope around the house
all day in your underwear.

02:42.678 --> 02:45.420
You're on notice. Consider you
ass kicked to the curb.

02:45.447 --> 02:48.891
Marce, I got no place to go.
Karen won't have me, Becca won't have me,

02:48.906 --> 02:51.089
The world thinks I am this degenerate
scumbag.

02:51.105 --> 02:53.387
I am out on bail second time
this week.

02:53.562 --> 02:56.717
You are my two and only friends left
in the world.

02:57.555 --> 02:58.673
C'mon.

02:59.173 --> 03:00.320
Love me.

03:01.573 --> 03:04.233
- Hank needs some sugar.
- God...

03:19.335 --> 03:21.109
I'm game if you guys are.

03:21.285 --> 03:22.797
Fucking animals!

03:23.008 --> 03:26.646
Damn, would it kill you
to put some goddamn clothes on!

03:26.874 --> 03:30.664
So I like to sleep in the raw now big whoop,
what do you care?

03:31.821 --> 03:33.921
Get a load of Florence Olivier.

03:34.166 --> 03:38.832
- I don't look that bad, do I?
- No way, Charlie, no. You look good.

03:39.060 --> 03:42.058
Like a baby.
Like a big sexy baby.

03:42.059 --> 03:43.258
Thank you.

04:32.202 --> 04:34.202
- Good luck today, buddy.
- Thank you.

04:35.101 --> 04:38.341
- Who knows maybe get some writing done.
- Fuck you.

04:40.579 --> 04:42.579
Love you too.

04:45.301 --> 04:48.822
Hello, old friend.
You're looking quite well.

04:56.512 --> 04:57.762
Much better.

05:06.485 --> 05:08.036
C'mon.

05:11.986 --> 05:13.682
Yeah, I'm on my way.. Uh-huh.

05:18.126 --> 05:21.248
Just picking up old
blackey here. Yeah.

05:21.679 --> 05:24.004
- Me? Oh I'm..I'm OK.
- Ok.

05:24.040 --> 05:26.831
As good as can be expected under
the circumstances, and you?

05:26.869 --> 05:29.788
- I was gonna check out the...
- Excellent! How about Becca?

05:29.875 --> 05:32.658
Cool! Glad to hear that.
Give her a kiss from me.

05:32.694 --> 05:35.166
Hey, you wouldn't happen to have any
jumper cables, would ya?

05:35.288 --> 05:38.432
No, I get it. Just keep on walking.
I know, I ruined your life and all

05:38.450 --> 05:40.330
and I couldn't be more sorry
about it, but...

05:40.366 --> 05:42.696
I gotta get across town
to my attorney's office

05:42.732 --> 05:45.146
where lateness is frowned upon.

05:53.301 --> 05:54.923
I caught that?

05:54.993 --> 05:58.043
You wouldn't have looked if you didn't care.
You should care, you know.

05:58.563 --> 06:01.669
Bleeding here
feeling a little faint.

06:02.336 --> 06:06.040
Look, I don't hope to get back
into your good graces anytime soon.

06:06.787 --> 06:08.154
Ok, ever.

06:09.255 --> 06:12.201
I just hope that maybe one day I can sit down
across from you look you in the eye

06:12.231 --> 06:14.162
and talk to you and explain
to you what happened.

06:14.608 --> 06:17.560
Until then, I'll settle for seeing
our daughter who I miss dearly.

06:18.568 --> 06:21.816
She still has a father, you know?
Even if her mother hates his guts.

06:22.055 --> 06:26.119
Yeah. Well, what happens if she
hates your guts too?

06:47.980 --> 06:49.960
Hey you, lady lawyer.

06:50.726 --> 06:52.554
- Where you going?
- I have a meeting.

06:52.773 --> 06:54.685
- I thought we had a meeting.
- We did.

06:54.805 --> 06:57.903
But you're 45 minutes late.
So I'm moving on to my next meeting.

06:58.066 --> 06:59.649
- Fuck fuck..Alright.
- So much late. And rude.

06:59.674 --> 07:01.068
- Ok.
- And inconsiderate of other peoples' time.

07:01.076 --> 07:02.663
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be. It's your life.

07:02.665 --> 07:03.958
I was just..
I had this thing with my family.

07:03.967 --> 07:05.107
Three years, Hank.

07:05.710 --> 07:07.087
What? What.. Three years what?

07:07.125 --> 07:09.807
That's the maximum sentence
for unlawful sexual intercourse.

07:09.808 --> 07:12.148
Three years... state prison.

07:12.149 --> 07:16.017
Yes, but I thought we were all going ho
about making sure it dint go down that way.

07:16.018 --> 07:17.543
Well that's really my plan,

07:17.544 --> 07:21.240
because I am a cocky fucking attorney
and this is a great case for me.

07:21.241 --> 07:23.393
But if you insist upon dicking around
and wasting my time,

07:23.394 --> 07:26.122
I'll be happy to see you rot in jail.
What the fuck do I care?

07:26.123 --> 07:29.011
Here's another entitled smartass who thinks
it's OK to fuck a teenager.

07:29.012 --> 07:31.926
Ok. No no, I don't think it's OK.
I think it's wrong.

07:31.927 --> 07:33.033
Sick and wrong.

07:33.034 --> 07:34.951
And yet you fucked a teenager.

07:34.952 --> 07:36.498
C'mon, I thought we covered this.

07:36.499 --> 07:38.044
I didn't know how old she was,
She set me up.

07:38.045 --> 07:41.664
Ok. It doesn't matter. The DA is looking
to make an example of you.

07:41.665 --> 07:44.566
Statutory rape is a big fucking deal here,
in the golden state.

07:44.567 --> 07:45.601
Who knew?

07:45.602 --> 07:46.700
Maybe no one was hurt
in your case.

07:46.701 --> 07:48.602
I was hurt.
She punched me.

07:48.603 --> 07:50.543
Maybe it was all just good dirty fun.

07:50.544 --> 07:52.557
But there is probably some
creep out there...

07:52.558 --> 07:55.262
who's gonna think twice before banging the
babysitter because he just read

07:55.263 --> 07:56.355
about the Hollywood asshole

07:56.356 --> 08:00.292
who's doing serious time for sticking
his dick in some underage pussy.

08:01.020 --> 08:02.337
Hey. Can you say it louder?

08:02.338 --> 08:04.359
- Because I don't think they heard you.
- Yeah... yeah I think you need to hear me.

08:04.360 --> 08:05.137
I get it.

08:05.138 --> 08:07.555
Ok, from now on till the
preliminary hearing,

08:07.556 --> 08:08.912
just.. behave yourself.

08:08.913 --> 08:10.464
- Stay out of trouble.
- Yes. Yes, ma'am.

08:10.465 --> 08:11.286
Ok?

08:11.287 --> 08:15.359
With any luck, I'll convince the judge there's
not enough of a case to take it to trial.

08:15.903 --> 08:17.422
And if you can't?

08:17.815 --> 08:20.753
Then it's time we make a deal.
Do some horse trading.

08:20.754 --> 08:22.205
That can be fun too.

08:22.206 --> 08:24.158
You really love this shit, huh?

08:24.159 --> 08:26.665
Don't tell anyone I told you, but...

08:26.666 --> 08:28.490
Sometimes even better than sex.

08:28.491 --> 08:30.066
- Wow.
- Safer too.

08:30.067 --> 08:32.486
You must not like sex very much.

08:32.486 --> 08:35.580
No, see that's where you are wrong.
I love sex.

08:35.581 --> 08:38.451
You trying to turn me on,
lady lawyer?

08:39.505 --> 08:40.847
Oh please...

08:40.847 --> 08:42.655
I am obviously far too old for you.

08:42.657 --> 08:45.624
No, see, that's where you're wrong.
I like me and mature women.

08:45.625 --> 08:49.254
Gross feet, stretch marks, nipple hair.
I dig that, I dig it all.

08:49.255 --> 08:52.904
Love that shit. Not that you
have any of that shit...stuff...

08:52.905 --> 08:54.410
- I'm gonna go now.
- Yeah.

08:54.411 --> 08:55.859
Thank you.

09:03.691 --> 09:05.966
- It's coming.
- What?

09:07.057 --> 09:09.087
My fucking period.

09:09.522 --> 09:11.112
I'll alert the media.

09:11.113 --> 09:14.782
My tits are so sore, I'm crampy as hell.

09:14.783 --> 09:17.182
And I'm throwing up in my mouth
all day long.

09:17.183 --> 09:18.262
Nice.

09:18.477 --> 09:21.055
You're probably preggers. I mean,

09:21.056 --> 09:22.438
you are quite a slut.

09:22.439 --> 09:24.190
Fuck you.

09:24.374 --> 09:28.104
I'm too old to sustain life,
and too bitter too.

09:28.105 --> 09:30.711
If sperm would enter my pretty
little vajuju,

09:30.712 --> 09:35.093
and my cold black heart would kill
that shit dead son.

09:36.817 --> 09:38.722
<i>Go away.</i>

09:39.476 --> 09:41.929
Can you please do something
about that fucking Hank?

09:41.930 --> 09:44.002
What? You want me to put out a hit
on him or...

09:44.003 --> 09:45.140
Yes.

09:45.141 --> 09:46.749
- Seriously.
- Marcy, he's not my problem.

09:46.750 --> 09:48.446
- The guy is fucking miserable.
- Yeah.

09:48.447 --> 09:51.143
- He's making my life miserable, all right?
- I know.

09:51.144 --> 09:52.214
Isn't it bad enough that I have that

09:52.215 --> 09:56.216
pasty little man-child ex-husband of mine
under foot all the time?

09:56.217 --> 09:57.744
C'mon!

09:57.745 --> 09:59.909
You gotta let him see Becca.

09:59.910 --> 10:01.517
He needs a fix.

10:01.518 --> 10:03.560
It'll do them both some good.

10:03.561 --> 10:06.652
I don't know, you know, I don't know.
I'll think about it.

10:18.615 --> 10:19.972
What page you on?

10:19.973 --> 10:22.904
Don't add up to the nearest ten.
I know your tricks.

10:22.905 --> 10:25.128
Been kind of busy, assholio.

10:25.129 --> 10:28.520
Of course, of course, but you started
right? I mean...

10:28.521 --> 10:30.126
You typed "fade in"?

10:30.127 --> 10:33.589
Charlie, I haven't even had time to read
the draft they don't like.

10:33.590 --> 10:34.604
Hank.

10:34.605 --> 10:36.570
You're deal is closed.

10:36.571 --> 10:38.488
it's OK to start writing.

10:38.489 --> 10:40.205
You said you wanted to do this.

10:40.206 --> 10:43.263
Yes, that was before I became
Hank Moody statutory rapist.

10:43.264 --> 10:44.744
Doesn't exactly inspire one

10:44.745 --> 10:46.225
to sit in front of the typers.

10:46.226 --> 10:49.626
Hey, hey. This kind of ballyhoo
dint stop Polanski, did it? No.

10:49.627 --> 10:53.153
The man banged out script after script.
Movie after movie.

10:53.154 --> 10:55.578
He won himself nice little academy
award too, didn't he?

10:55.579 --> 10:58.734
Comparing me to the worlds most infamous
fan of underage girls

10:58.735 --> 11:00.957
is not the way to start a
pep talk, Charlie.

11:00.958 --> 11:02.680
Are you forgetting about R. Kelly?

11:02.681 --> 11:05.757
Jerry Lee Lewis! There's another one.
Shit he married one.

11:05.758 --> 11:07.537
I think she was his cousin too.

11:08.038 --> 11:09.702
That's kind of hot.

11:09.703 --> 11:10.939
If you say so.

11:10.940 --> 11:13.810
Work with me here, Hank.

11:37.981 --> 11:39.173
Hi.

11:40.203 --> 11:41.625
Hi!

11:42.725 --> 11:43.728
Hi.

11:43.729 --> 11:45.104
Hug?

11:45.105 --> 11:46.352
Too soon.

11:46.353 --> 11:47.418
Fair enough.

11:49.519 --> 11:53.075
So you... you wanna go for a walk
or something?

11:53.076 --> 11:57.221
You hungry? You wanna go down to strand,
you want to get ice cream or something?

11:57.222 --> 11:58.911
Not really.

11:59.203 --> 12:05.169
Is there anything you wanna do?
Particularly? Anything you need?

12:06.723 --> 12:09.753
C'mon Becca, I'm dying here.

12:11.329 --> 12:12.949
I need guitar strings.

12:12.950 --> 12:13.977
Ok.

12:13.978 --> 12:16.208
I can help with that. Definitely.

12:16.209 --> 12:19.955
We, we... can get on it... let's do this.
C'mon.

12:19.956 --> 12:21.266
Is that OK, Karen?

12:21.267 --> 12:23.601
As long as you come straight back.

12:23.602 --> 12:26.472
it's not like I'm gonna run for the border.

12:26.473 --> 12:30.111
I don't know what you're capable of
nowadays.

12:30.112 --> 12:32.423
I'll be in the car.

12:40.732 --> 12:43.032
Thank you, Karen. I know...

12:43.033 --> 12:45.351
how hard this must be for you.

12:46.835 --> 12:48.754
Do you?

13:08.969 --> 13:11.372
That sounds good, Jeff Becca.

13:12.337 --> 13:14.274
It sounds pretty good.

13:14.381 --> 13:15.352
What?

13:15.353 --> 13:16.673
You've been practicing.

13:16.674 --> 13:20.264
Yeah. Well, it's something to do.

13:22.322 --> 13:24.839
It doesn't have to be this hard, Becca.

13:24.840 --> 13:26.854
Shouldn't it be hard?

13:26.855 --> 13:30.686
I mean, isn't that what pretty much happens
after the final straw?

13:30.840 --> 13:34.491
It's impossible to make things
go back to the way they were?

13:38.027 --> 13:39.605
You like that guitar?

13:39.606 --> 13:42.165
What's not to like.
It's a classic.

13:42.166 --> 13:44.257
Well, let's get it then.

13:44.468 --> 13:46.297
No way, it's too expensive.

13:46.298 --> 13:49.205
You wanna take the instrument seriously
you need a serious instrument. C'mon.

13:49.206 --> 13:51.637
Whatever, I don't want it,
save your money.

13:51.638 --> 13:53.606
For a lawyer.

13:57.597 --> 13:59.409
We'll take this one.

14:02.197 --> 14:03.775
Thank you.

14:04.442 --> 14:07.983
That's one hell of a fiddle.
You're really a wild lucky girl.

14:07.984 --> 14:10.013
That's me, a lucky girl.

14:10.014 --> 14:11.931
You'll thank me one day.

14:13.717 --> 14:15.687
It came up declined, sir.

14:15.688 --> 14:18.206
- Try it again? - Yeah. That's actually
been doing this all day.

14:21.455 --> 14:23.178
I'm sorry, man, it's declined.

14:27.039 --> 14:29.864
Hey, you know, no worries, man.
I could set this thing aside for you.

14:30.097 --> 14:31.511
- No.
- Get your card sorted out.

14:31.653 --> 14:32.775
Won't be necessary.

14:35.281 --> 14:37.159
She's got talent, your kid, by the way.

14:37.160 --> 14:39.037
Great talent, man.
Lot of soul.

14:39.138 --> 14:40.570
Yeah, she sure does.

15:00.955 --> 15:02.306
Hey, you forgot these.

15:07.264 --> 15:09.157
Honey, I love you.

15:36.883 --> 15:38.738
Right. Ok.

15:39.394 --> 15:40.881
Cool. We'll see you there.

15:41.670 --> 15:43.838
What? Are you kidding?
This is great news.

15:44.764 --> 15:46.715
Yeah. Ok. Good.

15:47.997 --> 15:49.009
No, no, no, no, no.

15:49.075 --> 15:51.169
Pants on, buddy boy.
We got ourselves a meeting.

15:51.170 --> 15:53.537
Fuck that. I've had
a shit fucking day.

15:53.538 --> 15:54.905
My pants are off.

15:56.099 --> 15:57.476
I'm just gonna sit here,

15:58.217 --> 15:59.969
make good in snooker and watch my stories.

15:59.970 --> 16:01.327
Can you make me some dinner?

16:02.615 --> 16:04.477
How about I buy you some dinner?

16:05.043 --> 16:09.420
Oh... could we go to Long John Silver?
I used to love that place when I was a kid.

16:09.421 --> 16:13.513
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about
right now. But I have some very good news.

16:14.910 --> 16:17.028
Eddie Nero wants to sit down.

16:17.432 --> 16:19.193
- Why?
- Whyyyyy?

16:19.194 --> 16:21.433
Because he wants to play you dumbass
in the movie.

16:21.434 --> 16:24.397
No, I hate that fuck,
that self satisfied prick.

16:24.398 --> 16:27.806
I'm holding out for Keithel. When in
doubt, call in the bad lieutenant.

16:27.807 --> 16:31.214
Plus the guy loves to show his dong.
Gotta love that in a thespian.

16:31.215 --> 16:32.452
We'll put him on the list.

16:32.453 --> 16:35.277
C'mon, c'mon, you'll have a good time.
C'mon, here we go.

16:35.278 --> 16:39.626
- Will there be alcoholic beverages?
- Most def. Most def. As many as you like.

16:39.733 --> 16:42.886
And.. I'm sure there will be
kind words and flattery.

16:44.150 --> 16:45.759
Can we stop at an in&out on the way?

16:45.760 --> 16:47.956
- Yes. Hank. We can stop…
- Yayyyyy!

16:47.957 --> 16:50.410
Let's go. Let's go.
Pants up.

16:52.764 --> 16:54.289
Becca hates me, Charlie.

16:59.811 --> 17:01.670
She'll get over it, buddy boy.

17:03.772 --> 17:05.020
We all do.

17:18.159 --> 17:20.082
- So is there a script?
- Fuck, no.

17:20.083 --> 17:21.661
- But he's getting close.
- Ish.

17:21.662 --> 17:24.508
Hopefully it'll give you a sizable
boner when I am done.

17:25.990 --> 17:27.021
Thank you.

17:28.248 --> 17:31.238
- You know what I like about you, Moody?
- No, what's that?

17:35.037 --> 17:36.336
You're handsome.

17:38.732 --> 17:40.028
Well aren't you the charmer.

17:40.029 --> 17:41.914
Most writers aren't handsome.

17:42.350 --> 17:45.252
They're usually pale,
sun starved,

17:45.253 --> 17:48.154
man titted, little weaklings
like you friend here.

17:48.450 --> 17:50.080
Thank you. Thank you very much.

17:50.094 --> 17:55.241
Always whining about the words,
if it ain't on the page it ain't on the stage.

17:55.242 --> 17:56.820
Fuck that!

17:57.276 --> 17:58.854
You know what I say?

17:58.855 --> 18:03.832
If it ain't on the stage, there ain't nobody showing
up at the goddamn motherfucking theater anyway.

18:04.257 --> 18:08.065
Listen to classical music?
Listen to motherfucking jazz.

18:15.060 --> 18:15.991
Got me?

18:16.026 --> 18:17.909
No. You represent everything I hate,

18:17.910 --> 18:20.993
But I do find you highly entertaining.
Continue, please.

18:21.514 --> 18:23.146
You're a fucking man.

18:23.485 --> 18:26.325
- You understand the dark side.
- I do?

18:26.403 --> 18:28.480
You've seen some shit.

18:29.102 --> 18:32.157
The handsome man, comes with a prize.

18:33.304 --> 18:34.598
It's a burden.

18:35.410 --> 18:36.948
And you understand that.

18:37.637 --> 18:41.995
And plus,
the motherfucking dark side,

18:43.596 --> 18:46.654
You know you wanna go! 
You know you do!

18:46.683 --> 18:49.535
Like a sex machine.

18:50.800 --> 18:51.772
You hear this guy?

18:51.773 --> 18:54.573
Bible's the truth!

18:56.428 --> 18:58.447
- Excuse me?
- What?

18:58.448 --> 19:02.359
I was agreeing with you, Eddie.
I'm a big fan, by the way.

19:02.360 --> 19:04.947
- Big fan.
- Keep quiet, little boy.

19:05.128 --> 19:07.923
Just sit back and nod
and drink your fucking girly cocktail.

19:10.608 --> 19:12.244
You know what I'd like to do to you?

19:12.522 --> 19:14.615
I'd like to shoot you in the dick
with a paintball gun.

19:15.588 --> 19:18.293
And watch you scream like a 14
year old fat girl.

19:19.271 --> 19:21.196
No place for you in man's world.

19:22.193 --> 19:24.745
Fucking suit. Ruining everything.

19:24.746 --> 19:27.011
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, what's with the
fucking mood swings?

19:27.022 --> 19:28.568
Be nice to my
friend, the countryman.

19:28.569 --> 19:31.952
Have a fucking drink.
Psycho…

19:36.137 --> 19:37.666
To hard cocks!

19:38.768 --> 19:40.242
And handsome men.

19:42.435 --> 19:43.943
Alright. Cheers.

19:46.456 --> 19:47.856
C'mon, goldilocks.

19:52.257 --> 19:56.830
Excuse me. I see a girl that I had
defecated on Palm Springs once.

20:01.338 --> 20:02.929
Hey, guys, I'm sorry I'm late.

20:02.930 --> 20:04.015
Where's Eddie going?

20:04.016 --> 20:05.815
He saw somebody
he pooped on once.

20:06.295 --> 20:07.323
Sweet.

20:07.324 --> 20:08.941
So what do we think?

20:08.950 --> 20:10.348
Do you think he'd be a good Hank?

20:10.651 --> 20:13.968
We think he's pretty much fucking insane
that's what we think.

20:13.999 --> 20:16.149
Speak for yourself. I thought he
was very compelling.

20:16.150 --> 20:18.167
He's cupping your junk,
you find that compelling, did you?

20:18.268 --> 20:20.593
I did. It was very intense.

20:20.678 --> 20:22.307
You can see why the man has an Oscar.

20:22.329 --> 20:24.770
Hey, you know I never did finish
giving you my notes.

20:24.771 --> 20:25.959
Oh, yeah, I think you did.

20:25.960 --> 20:27.465
No, pretty sure I didn't.

20:27.505 --> 20:30.781
Well, guess what, I'm not taking
any more notes. I'm full. So there.

20:32.887 --> 20:33.834
Your client's being very naughty.

20:33.835 --> 20:37.234
I think you should send him to my
room without any supper.

20:40.691 --> 20:44.381
Charlie, this can't be worth
at all for a stupid fucking movie

20:44.396 --> 20:47.403
that'll probably turn out to be
worse than the last one.

20:47.483 --> 20:50.667
The odds are against us, my friend, always.

20:50.861 --> 20:53.290
What're you gonna do?
Get a real job?

21:16.508 --> 21:17.498
Hello?

21:19.907 --> 21:21.307
Hello?

21:23.293 --> 21:24.377
Sasha Bingham?

21:24.464 --> 21:27.953
- Hey, hello.
- Hello!

21:28.306 --> 21:31.939
You are... pretty naked
under that thing, aren't you?

21:32.342 --> 21:34.572
You're pretty good at stating the obvious.

21:34.573 --> 21:37.156
You know, I gotta be honest with you,

21:37.157 --> 21:41.468
I don't think that we can continue
to do... stuff,

21:41.904 --> 21:45.300
Stuff... stuff of physical nature.

21:45.413 --> 21:47.831
Oh, why is that, you don't enjoy yourself?

21:47.832 --> 21:49.147
No, no I'm sure, it was stars,

21:49.148 --> 21:51.440
Just that I don't remember much
after the K.O.

21:51.441 --> 21:53.169
You know, but the sex is always
pretty good.

21:53.170 --> 21:55.327
- Pretty good?
- Yeah, you know like pizza,

21:55.328 --> 21:59.500
or Mexican food or sushi even.
No, sushi is pretty high on mass.

21:59.501 --> 22:01.650
Is this like a technique of yours,

22:01.651 --> 22:04.258
you know where you insult the girl
so she'll want you even more?

22:04.259 --> 22:06.473
Because it's totally working.

22:06.474 --> 22:10.965
Yeah, it's just that I'm..I'm in a hell
of a lot of trouble these days.

22:10.966 --> 22:13.539
Yeah, this whole statutory rape thing
is pretty fucked up.

22:13.540 --> 22:14.820
Totally.

22:14.835 --> 22:16.392
It is kind of hot though too...

22:16.393 --> 22:18.843
You know, knowing that I slept
with a criminal.

22:18.844 --> 22:21.231
- Alleged criminal! Thank you very much...
- Ah, yes.

22:21.232 --> 22:23.486
Speaking of that
bit of unpleasantness,

22:23.487 --> 22:25.111
the rape, not our physical union,

22:25.112 --> 22:28.582
it's probably not the best time to be
getting involved with the actress

22:28.583 --> 22:31.968
who's gonna play the girl
who I raped... allegedly.

22:31.969 --> 22:33.286
I get what you're saying,

22:33.287 --> 22:37.494
but that doesn't mean I don't want one or
more of your fingers in my vagina right now.

22:37.771 --> 22:40.346
- Why you have to talk to me like that?
- Talk like what?

22:40.347 --> 22:42.725
It just makes it...

22:42.960 --> 22:44.027
kinda hard to...

22:44.328 --> 22:46.373
clink clearly.

22:48.488 --> 22:51.112
Yes, guess it does it make it kinda hard.

23:05.945 --> 23:07.642
- Shit!
- No, I can do better.

23:07.643 --> 23:09.677
No, no, no, the door.

23:13.884 --> 23:16.644
Shit, shit, shit, Eddie Niro.
Hold on, Eddie!

23:16.645 --> 23:17.789
What does that douchebag want?

23:17.790 --> 23:20.154
He want us to talk about the project,
I told him he could stop by,

23:20.155 --> 23:22.048
but I did not think he would.

23:22.247 --> 23:24.640
- I'll go then, I'll just leave.
- You don't mind?

23:24.641 --> 23:26.593
No I don't mind, I mean,
maybe I should, but

23:26.594 --> 23:30.028
I think I'm just too tired to
figure that out, so, yeah I'm good.

23:30.029 --> 23:33.589
Hey, actually just uh.. just hide in
the bathroom, OK?

23:33.590 --> 23:35.075
Hide in the bathroom?
Why do I have to hide?

23:35.076 --> 23:37.157
Because I don't want him to
know you're here, duh?

23:37.158 --> 23:38.320
- Duh?
- Yeah.

23:38.321 --> 23:41.472
Look, the secret to being a
successful Hollywood actress,

23:41.473 --> 23:45.874
is projecting the vibe that everyone
you work with has a shot at fucking you.

23:45.875 --> 23:47.025
That's the secret?

23:47.026 --> 23:49.824
You mean to tell me
you wouldn't fuck Eddie Niro?

23:49.825 --> 23:53.858
One of the greatest actors
in present generation... allegedly?

23:53.859 --> 23:56.703
No, I would, he's hot,
that's just not the point.

23:57.197 --> 24:00.256
- He poops on people.
- Just hide in the bathroom, OK?

24:00.257 --> 24:03.700
Yeah, I'm gonna go get rid of him,
go downstairs for a drink. How do I look?

24:03.701 --> 24:05.523
Good enough to shit on.

24:05.524 --> 24:07.199
Would it kill you to put on a bra?

24:07.200 --> 24:09.037
Ooooohhh.... are you jealous?

24:09.038 --> 24:10.799
- No?
- No!

24:10.800 --> 24:12.841
I don't know, it's just that...

24:12.842 --> 24:16.553
I just had one or more fingers inside you,
and I don't know where you come from

24:16.554 --> 24:20.360
but the way I was raised,
that's pretty intimate.

25:26.835 --> 25:28.846
<i>Thirteen!</i>

26:01.232 --> 26:03.192
<i>To my dear beautiful daughter.</i>

26:03.193 --> 26:07.421
<i>I'm writing you a letter, that's right,
a good old fashioned letter.</i>

26:07.471 --> 26:11.930
<i>It's a lost art really,
like handjobs... Shit.</i>

26:13.338 --> 26:15.346
<i>I have a confession to make:</i>

26:15.387 --> 26:17.869
<i>I didn't like you very much at first</i>

26:17.870 --> 26:20.564
<i>You were just this little annoying
little blob,</i>

26:20.565 --> 26:23.778
<i>You smelled nice,
most of the time.</i>

26:23.779 --> 26:26.403
<i>But you didn't seem to have much
interest in me.</i>

26:26.462 --> 26:29.504
<i>Which of course I found
vaguely insulting.</i>

26:29.628 --> 26:32.623
<i>It was just you and your mom
against the world,</i>

26:32.624 --> 26:35.277
<i>funny how somethings never change.</i>

26:35.713 --> 26:39.380
<i>So I cruised along, doing my thing,
acting the fool,</i>

26:39.483 --> 26:43.386
<i>not really understanding how being
a parent changes you.</i>

26:43.717 --> 26:47.081
<i>And I don't remember the exact moment
everything changed.</i>

26:47.251 --> 26:49.215
<i>I just know that it did.</i>

26:49.702 --> 26:53.432
<i>One minute I was impenetrable,
nothing could touch me,</i>

26:53.433 --> 26:57.580
<i>the next my heart was somehow
beating outside my chest,</i>

26:57.581 --> 27:00.062
exposed to the elements.

27:00.204 --> 27:06.099
<i>Loving you has been the most profound,
intense and painful experience of my life.</i>

27:06.210 --> 27:09.078
<i>In fact it's been almost too much to bear.</i>

27:09.234 --> 27:13.523
<i>As your father, I made a silent vow
to protect you from the world.</i>

27:13.524 --> 27:15.305
<i>Never realised I was the one</i>

27:15.306 --> 27:17.737
who would end up hurting you
the most.

27:18.088 --> 27:20.986
<i>When I flash forward my heart breaks.</i>

27:21.046 --> 27:25.382
<i>Mostly because I can't imagine you
speaking of me with any sort of pride.</i>

27:25.411 --> 27:27.050
<i>How could you?</i>

27:27.085 --> 27:29.827
<i>Your father is a child in a man's body,</i>

27:29.893 --> 27:33.259
<i>he cares for nothing and
everything at the same time.</i>

27:33.392 --> 27:36.223
<i>Noble in thought
weak in action.</i>

27:36.224 --> 27:40.073
Something has to change,
something has to give.

27:42.099 --> 27:45.738
<i>It's getting dark,
too dark to see.</i>
