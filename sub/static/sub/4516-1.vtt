01:08.027 --> 01:10.113
Exhaust it !

01:23.126 --> 01:25.170
Don't kill it ! Exhaust it !

03:29.455 --> 03:30.744
Peace be upon you.

03:31.167 --> 03:32.689
And upon you Peace.

03:37.329 --> 03:38.755
Peace be upon you.

03:41.282 --> 03:42.001
Here.

03:50.708 --> 03:51.692
Cheers.

03:52.901 --> 03:54.903
Medications.

03:58.948 --> 04:00.700
Two tablets in the morning,

04:00.950 --> 04:02.535
two in the evening.

04:03.118 --> 04:03.488
Yes...

04:04.162 --> 04:06.956
They replaced that one.

04:07.123 --> 04:09.208
Yes, I know. A generic.

04:20.261 --> 04:21.262
Let's go.

04:42.075 --> 04:43.576
Attention !

04:44.160 --> 04:46.204
Important information !

04:46.996 --> 04:49.123
Cigarettes are prohibited.

04:49.457 --> 04:51.501
Music is prohibited.

04:53.461 --> 04:56.047
Women must wear socks.

04:56.589 --> 04:57.799
Attention !

04:58.925 --> 05:03.721
Women must wear socks and gloves!

05:08.893 --> 05:11.270
For those who speak Bambara...

05:14.273 --> 05:15.692
No cigarettes.

05:16.484 --> 05:17.860
No music.

05:18.736 --> 05:21.406
For those who go to the market,

05:21.656 --> 05:23.700
socks are required.

05:23.992 --> 05:25.118
Understood ?

05:25.535 --> 05:28.287
I just said it in Bambara.

05:31.916 --> 05:35.003
- Roll up your pants. 
- All my pants are like that.

05:35.169 --> 05:38.006
Roll them up, it's the new law.

05:40.508 --> 05:42.135
I said roll them up !

06:33.991 --> 06:36.043
Peace be upon you.

06:36.564 --> 06:38.232
What brings you here?

06:39.442 --> 06:41.903
We have a new announcement.

06:42.070 --> 06:44.155
And you just enter like that?

06:44.322 --> 06:47.033
One does not enter the house of God

06:47.450 --> 06:50.912
with shoes and weapons.

06:51.079 --> 06:52.288
It's not right.

06:52.955 --> 06:55.458
We can. We do jihad.

06:56.417 --> 07:01.047
You do jihad? And you want to do it here?

07:01.547 --> 07:03.508
In the house of God?

07:03.925 --> 07:07.178
Here in Timbuktu, one dedicated to religion

07:07.553 --> 07:11.557
does it with his head and not with weapons.

07:12.100 --> 07:15.645
It is the hour of prayer, we want to pray peacefully.

07:15.812 --> 07:18.689
Please get out.

07:45.716 --> 07:47.593
Get away from my nets!

07:54.517 --> 07:55.643
You hear me?

08:55.828 --> 08:57.538
Guess what I'm thinking,

08:58.789 --> 09:01.083
at this moment.

09:05.504 --> 09:07.048
What ?

09:12.386 --> 09:13.471
About your cattle.

09:15.139 --> 09:16.724
About GPS, your favorite!

09:18.059 --> 09:19.060
GPS...

09:20.061 --> 09:21.771
- This is your answer? 
- Yes.

09:23.981 --> 09:25.733
Do you know something ?

09:26.567 --> 09:28.653
If GPS has a calf

09:28.903 --> 09:30.446
and if it's a bull,

09:31.280 --> 09:32.657
I will give it to Issan.

09:33.074 --> 09:36.118
He deserves all your flock.

09:37.203 --> 09:38.371
All cattle?

09:38.537 --> 09:39.163
Yes.

09:39.330 --> 09:42.124
He deserves it, he's a good boy.

09:43.960 --> 09:48.381
He will be happy just with the calf of GPS.

09:48.547 --> 09:49.632
Don't you think?

09:50.174 --> 09:51.342
He will.

09:53.261 --> 09:55.388
Will you give him all the flock?

09:55.930 --> 09:58.516
He deserves it, that boy!

09:58.683 --> 10:00.309
I swear he deserves it.

10:22.206 --> 10:23.124
Thank you.

10:23.708 --> 10:25.084
I'll pay you later.

11:07.001 --> 11:08.836
Thank you, see you.

11:24.602 --> 11:26.812
Sister, you must wear these gloves!

11:27.021 --> 11:30.024
Wear gloves to sell fish?

11:30.816 --> 11:34.070
How will I water them with gloves?

11:34.528 --> 11:37.073
Our parents raised us with honor.

11:37.239 --> 11:39.408
Without gloves.

11:39.910 --> 11:40.886
That's enough!

11:41.007 --> 11:42.001
You want to cut hands?

11:42.327 --> 11:42.937
Here are two! Cut them off!

11:43.260 --> 11:43.908
We do no cut hands here !

11:45.652 --> 11:46.769
For gloves, we need hands!

11:50.878 --> 11:52.588
We do not fight with these people.

11:52.922 --> 11:55.758
We're sick and tired! 
They already forced us to wear veil.

11:55.925 --> 11:57.843
How to work with gloves?

11:58.010 --> 11:59.553
Calm down.

12:00.012 --> 12:01.389
Not today, not tomorrow!

12:01.555 --> 12:04.517
- In this case, we take you away. 
- Take me.

12:05.059 --> 12:06.811
What needs to happen will happen!

12:08.729 --> 12:09.980
Give this to my mother.

12:16.654 --> 12:18.489
Release the handbrake.

12:21.117 --> 12:22.576
To the right.

12:24.078 --> 12:25.079
Go ahead.

12:27.790 --> 12:29.166
Look in front of you.

12:37.842 --> 12:38.843
We start again.

12:40.594 --> 12:41.512
Again!

12:53.899 --> 12:54.984
Abdelkrim!

12:55.818 --> 12:57.111
Can I tell you something ?

12:57.278 --> 12:58.070
Yes, please.

12:59.530 --> 13:00.364
You see ?

13:01.073 --> 13:02.533
You do not know everything.

13:05.327 --> 13:08.767
Only God Almighty knows everything in this life.

13:08.895 --> 13:09.295
God be praised.

13:15.296 --> 13:16.422
Did you drink ?

13:17.465 --> 13:18.757
Yes, with mom.

13:30.936 --> 13:32.813
Where were you this morning?

13:35.316 --> 13:36.942
With the goats.

13:40.070 --> 13:41.280
You watched the herd?

13:43.782 --> 13:46.327
You're a good girl.

13:50.372 --> 13:51.499
My little bird ...

13:55.044 --> 13:57.588
Wait for me until I return.

13:58.631 --> 14:00.758
I'll bring you gifts.

14:02.218 --> 14:04.261
Look at me. Is it okay?

14:07.681 --> 14:10.142
Watch over the herd.

14:12.645 --> 14:13.687
See you later.

14:19.276 --> 14:20.444
Daddy!

14:27.576 --> 14:28.661
My bird ...

14:29.453 --> 14:32.414
Daddy will make a trip and return.

14:32.998 --> 14:35.209
Watch the house and wait.

14:53.227 --> 14:54.895
Dad has left.

14:55.312 --> 14:57.106
I told him

14:57.273 --> 15:01.026
not to forget us.

15:08.242 --> 15:11.453
You want to convince me to give up the jihad.

15:12.496 --> 15:13.372
Me ?

15:13.914 --> 15:16.834
Who am I to say, "Give up the jihad" ?

15:17.418 --> 15:19.795
The jihad of others is not my business.

15:21.255 --> 15:23.841
I do jihad for myself.

15:24.049 --> 15:28.053
I swear, I do not have time for the jihad of others.

15:28.220 --> 15:30.222
If I was not committed

15:30.389 --> 15:32.725
to my moral improvement,

15:33.058 --> 15:36.103
I would be the first among you.

15:38.188 --> 15:40.941
I pray to Allah, the Almighty,

15:41.150 --> 15:44.778
and hope he forgives me and forgive you.

15:45.029 --> 15:48.907
Help us to turn away from the vanity and pride.

15:49.366 --> 15:50.326
Stop what you are doing.

15:50.951 --> 15:54.163
You damage Islam and Muslims.

15:54.622 --> 15:56.624
You endanger the children

15:57.875 --> 15:59.543
in front of their poor mothers.

16:00.419 --> 16:01.837
You even hit

16:02.880 --> 16:04.673
the mother of two children,

16:05.174 --> 16:08.260
without an acceptable reason.

16:10.346 --> 16:11.055
Before you

16:11.889 --> 16:14.433
a woman came here to complain

16:15.267 --> 16:19.438
that you forced her to wear gloves ...

16:20.189 --> 16:21.315
like that ...

16:22.316 --> 16:23.567
without explanation,

16:23.984 --> 16:26.278
without demonstrating their utility,

16:26.445 --> 16:28.656
as prescribed by Allah and His Prophet.

16:28.822 --> 16:32.951
Remember the words of Allah Almighty:

16:35.079 --> 16:36.330
"Forgive them.

16:37.164 --> 16:38.707
"Involve them in decisions.

16:39.041 --> 16:40.668
"Talk with them.

16:40.918 --> 16:43.629
"Once you have decided, 
put your trust in Allah,'

16:43.796 --> 16:46.382
"Because He loves those who trust him."

16:47.675 --> 16:49.176
Where is the mercy?

16:50.052 --> 16:51.428
Where is forgiveness?

16:51.970 --> 16:53.722
Where is the piety?

16:54.723 --> 16:56.892
Where is the change, the change?

16:57.518 --> 16:59.561
Where is God in all this?

17:06.527 --> 17:08.904
These are the people that I do not like.

17:12.616 --> 17:14.867
I do not like them.

17:17.037 --> 17:20.124
But the driver is nice.

17:21.458 --> 17:23.669
Who told you he was nice?

17:48.508 --> 17:49.250
Peace be upon you !

17:49.820 --> 17:51.155
How are you doing?

17:51.321 --> 17:52.281
Good.

17:57.411 --> 17:59.872
You always come when my husband is gone.

18:00.038 --> 18:01.749
I am a married woman.

18:06.587 --> 18:10.966
You go to see her every day after her husband leaves.

18:11.341 --> 18:13.844
She is a married woman.

18:21.101 --> 18:23.479
She must cover her head, it's indecent.

18:23.937 --> 18:26.315
He tells you to cover your head.

18:28.984 --> 18:31.737
If it displeases him, he should look away.

18:31.904 --> 18:34.114
A man who harms a woman is ungodly.

18:40.996 --> 18:42.122
She says ...

18:42.456 --> 18:45.459
nobody invited you here.

18:45.751 --> 18:48.962
And do not look at what you don't like to see.

18:50.339 --> 18:53.675
If she needs something, she can ask me.

18:54.009 --> 18:58.055
If you need something, you can ask him.

19:26.792 --> 19:28.210
Have a good day!

20:08.125 --> 20:09.293
We joined in 1990,

20:09.459 --> 20:12.462
and we beat them in 2001, 2003 and 2005.

20:12.754 --> 20:14.298
2005 ? I don't agree.

20:14.464 --> 20:16.008
In 2005 they beat us.

20:16.174 --> 20:17.551
Are you sure about that ?

20:17.718 --> 20:18.886
Of course.

20:19.052 --> 20:20.053
No, you need to review this.

20:20.220 --> 20:21.680
In 2001 he already left.

20:21.847 --> 20:23.807
Who says he left ?

20:25.434 --> 20:26.643
Scumbags.

20:31.189 --> 20:33.483
I respect Zidane, he is a great player.

20:33.650 --> 20:35.694
But he doesn't have the record Messi has.

20:35.861 --> 20:37.487
Messi scored three or four goals per match.

20:37.654 --> 20:39.156
Comparing Barcelona with Real Madrid is pointless.

20:39.323 --> 20:40.073
Never !

20:40.240 --> 20:41.533
I'm not comparing,

20:41.700 --> 20:43.243
I just set the record straight.

20:43.410 --> 20:46.079
At that time, France was the only team

20:46.246 --> 20:49.166
in the world, that defeated all its rivals.

20:49.333 --> 20:52.044
And also won the World Cup.

20:52.210 --> 20:54.504
No... let me tell you about France,

20:54.671 --> 20:56.632
it's the only country so well known

20:56.798 --> 20:58.425
that hasn't really ever won anything !

20:58.800 --> 21:00.552
They paid money to Brazil in '98,

21:00.719 --> 21:04.473
or sent them a ship loaded with rice because they are so poor.

21:04.640 --> 21:06.975
And told them: go to bed and let us score three goals.

21:07.225 --> 21:09.186
And so they won the World Cup !

21:30.684 --> 21:32.193
Me... I need to leave.

21:48.423 --> 21:49.959
I need to leave.

23:01.885 --> 23:02.944
Stop, stop.

23:11.933 --> 23:14.770
Satima is beautiful, she has a strong spirit.

23:16.229 --> 23:17.981
Her husband is a good man.

23:18.982 --> 23:20.734
What are you talking about,

23:21.068 --> 23:23.653
a strong spirit, a good man?

23:25.113 --> 23:26.698
One should be a good believer.

23:27.240 --> 23:30.118
They are believers, and that's enough.

23:35.582 --> 23:37.959
Omar, how bad is your Arabic !

23:38.043 --> 23:39.002
Yes, I know.

23:39.169 --> 23:42.622
I can speak Tamasheq and English.

24:33.873 --> 24:35.483
It's a stormy day.

24:36.852 --> 24:39.104
Yes... it makes us think of the past.

24:39.271 --> 24:41.064
The neighbors left.

24:43.817 --> 24:45.485
Everyone fled.

24:47.070 --> 24:48.530
There's nobody left.

24:52.450 --> 24:54.327
There is only us.

25:00.542 --> 25:02.460
I rather stay here.

25:04.713 --> 25:05.755
Where should we go?

25:10.927 --> 25:13.013
Why should we always run?

25:13.972 --> 25:15.599
Where to go with Toya

25:15.765 --> 25:18.602
facing thirst and drought?

25:20.228 --> 25:23.440
Still, we should be closer to others.

25:27.194 --> 25:29.571
The neighbors will eventually return.

25:30.405 --> 25:32.616
All this will stop one day.

25:35.911 --> 25:38.079
These people scare me.

25:38.955 --> 25:40.874
When you're not here, they come.

25:46.338 --> 25:47.380
Here?

25:48.840 --> 25:49.841
Inside the tent?

25:50.550 --> 25:51.468
No.

26:03.063 --> 26:05.232
I'd like you to support me.

26:07.192 --> 26:08.735
To have patience.

26:13.657 --> 26:15.116
If we stick together,

26:16.868 --> 26:19.913
we will fight and we will make it out.

26:29.005 --> 26:30.840
I know you're scared.

26:31.174 --> 26:32.884
Me too, I'm afraid.

26:42.102 --> 26:44.896
Admit that you miss your friends !

26:45.063 --> 26:46.231
That is true.

26:59.828 --> 27:01.288
Lift up the lamp, my brother.

27:03.206 --> 27:04.082
To the right... to the right.

27:05.292 --> 27:06.918
You need to look at me.

27:07.339 --> 27:08.518
In the name of God, the merciful.

27:08.999 --> 27:09.992
Peace be upon you brothers.

27:11.256 --> 27:12.716
As you know,

27:12.882 --> 27:14.551
the Prophet said:

27:15.010 --> 27:17.053
Believers are parts of the same body...

27:18.013 --> 27:19.889
... when one is hurt ...

27:20.056 --> 27:21.891
... the others suffer too.

27:23.852 --> 27:24.936
In the past,

27:26.146 --> 27:27.939
I was doing music

27:28.106 --> 27:29.858
I was a rapper.

27:30.191 --> 27:32.736
In other words, I was a sinner.

27:34.446 --> 27:36.531
But thanks to God ...

27:36.865 --> 27:38.992
The problem is you lack of focus.

27:39.159 --> 27:41.328
I don't feel any persuasion in what you say.

27:41.494 --> 27:43.705
Are you convinced of what you say here?

27:43.872 --> 27:45.290
- No.
- There you go, tell it to me straight.

27:45.457 --> 27:47.125
It's not worth the pain of filming it.

27:47.584 --> 27:49.294
Let me do it.

27:56.509 --> 27:57.594
Brothers,

27:58.053 --> 27:59.637
In the past I was doing rap.

27:59.804 --> 28:01.556
Today, God be praised,

28:01.723 --> 28:03.475
I am on the road of God.

28:03.641 --> 28:05.769
The road of Jihad.

28:05.935 --> 28:07.729
Do you see my eyes ? There's no movement,

28:07.896 --> 28:09.272
no extraneous gestures.

28:09.439 --> 28:10.690
I am convinced of what I say.

28:10.857 --> 28:12.192
This is how you should say it.

28:12.359 --> 28:14.402
Don't move like that or like this.

28:14.569 --> 28:18.198
We're not doing rap, this is serious.

28:19.074 --> 28:20.075
Come.

28:29.751 --> 28:31.002
In this world,

28:31.836 --> 28:33.129
everything perishes...

28:38.510 --> 28:41.805
Stop. What is bothering you in this world ?

28:44.432 --> 28:47.185
Firstly, the West...

28:47.352 --> 28:50.522
The injustice ! You decry injustice.

28:52.399 --> 28:55.944
Injustice... You've seen parents suffering,

28:56.111 --> 28:58.279
You've seen the abuse.

28:58.446 --> 29:01.241
It must stop today. You're done waiting.

29:06.704 --> 29:08.456
In this world...

29:42.073 --> 29:43.867
Where is this music coming from?

29:44.033 --> 29:46.995
Abu Hassan sent us to find where it comes from.

29:47.162 --> 29:49.831
Go there. We are searching here.

29:49.998 --> 29:51.374
Let's go.

30:20.612 --> 30:24.782
You're going that way, me this way, we meet in the square.

30:25.174 --> 30:25.852
Ok.

31:41.025 --> 31:42.694
Good evening, Abu Hassan.

31:43.653 --> 31:44.779
Good evening.

31:45.655 --> 31:47.824
I know where the music comes from.

31:49.617 --> 31:51.661
I found where the music comes from.

31:52.412 --> 31:55.915
There are praises to God and His prophet.

32:03.089 --> 32:04.299
Should I hold them?

32:44.881 --> 32:46.382
Pay attention to my nets!

33:02.065 --> 33:03.066
GPS !

34:48.795 --> 34:50.130
Daddy !

34:50.297 --> 34:54.217
Issan returned crying without his stick.

34:54.469 --> 34:55.636
Where?

35:10.526 --> 35:12.111
What happened, my boy?

35:12.278 --> 35:13.529
Where are the animals ?

35:15.615 --> 35:16.991
Why are you crying?

35:18.534 --> 35:19.660
Where are the animals ?

35:21.370 --> 35:23.289
GPS is dead.

35:25.041 --> 35:26.250
what about GPS ?

35:27.919 --> 35:28.753
Who killed her?

35:31.798 --> 35:32.882
She was killed ...

35:33.716 --> 35:35.426
by Amadou, the fisherman.

35:40.848 --> 35:42.058
Get up.

35:42.266 --> 35:43.100
Come.

36:00.618 --> 36:02.328
Stop crying.

36:02.495 --> 36:04.038
Tell me what happened.

36:05.456 --> 36:07.667
I led the animals to the river,

36:08.626 --> 36:09.836
to drink...

36:12.839 --> 36:15.633
GPS escaped and went straight

36:16.551 --> 36:18.511
into the nets of Amadou.

36:23.307 --> 36:25.059
I went to get her,

36:25.226 --> 36:28.729
but I arrived too late, he had killed her.

37:14.233 --> 37:16.319
Don't cry, Issan.

37:24.368 --> 37:26.078
Amadou killed GPS.

37:26.954 --> 37:28.873
Why did he kill her?

37:29.999 --> 37:32.668
To prevent the herd from drinking.

37:33.377 --> 37:35.004
I do not understand.

37:37.924 --> 37:40.384
You should go talk to him.

37:40.551 --> 37:42.011
Go without your weapon.

37:42.720 --> 37:45.181
That weapon, I've had it since you met me.

37:45.848 --> 37:48.309
When I met you, you did not have Toya.

37:52.730 --> 37:56.275
Weep not, it will not bring GPS back.

37:56.442 --> 37:58.194
Do not cry.

38:03.115 --> 38:05.242
We will have another cow

38:07.078 --> 38:10.539
and we will call her GPS too.

38:33.229 --> 38:35.606
Come what may.

38:41.696 --> 38:42.863
But all this ...

38:44.031 --> 38:45.241
should stop.

38:46.659 --> 38:48.536
The humiliation should not continue.

38:52.248 --> 38:54.417
What I don't say, you know.

39:20.234 --> 39:23.571
Issan, why are you worried ?

39:23.821 --> 39:26.407
I think of my father.

39:26.574 --> 39:28.492
How was your father?

39:28.784 --> 39:30.661
My father was big,

39:31.287 --> 39:34.123
strong and kind.

39:37.668 --> 39:39.670
A better stockbreeder than yours.

39:39.920 --> 39:41.839
He knew more about the animals.

39:42.840 --> 39:44.216
My father is also

39:44.675 --> 39:47.303
big and strong,

39:48.095 --> 39:50.723
and if he's still alive,

39:51.182 --> 39:55.144
it's because he plays guitar and he sings.

39:55.686 --> 39:59.315
He is not with the warriors.

39:59.482 --> 40:03.569
Those who wage war die quickly.

40:04.195 --> 40:06.947
If he is there or not,

40:07.114 --> 40:10.743
I know he sings, but don't tell anyone.

40:12.536 --> 40:14.371
I will not tell anyone.

40:33.808 --> 40:34.975
Here...

40:35.142 --> 40:36.644
...under Islam...

40:37.744 --> 40:40.671
..it is forbidden...

40:41.023 --> 40:42.942
Peace be upon you.

40:44.318 --> 40:46.737
- Is this ball yours ? 
- No, I swear!

40:48.906 --> 40:50.366
It is forbidden... 

40:51.534 --> 40:52.910
... sitting...

40:54.537 --> 40:55.496
...in the streets...

40:55.663 --> 40:57.623
...and in front of houses...

40:57.790 --> 40:59.333
...and doing idle things...

41:00.501 --> 41:02.253
...to waste time...

41:03.629 --> 41:04.880
...in the street.

41:34.785 --> 41:36.787
Come on, baby.

42:02.563 --> 42:04.773
Repeated in French

42:07.902 --> 42:09.862
The sin of adultery

42:11.238 --> 42:13.032
and uncleanness.

42:13.532 --> 42:14.825
Adultery...

42:15.451 --> 42:18.829
...during the month of Ramadan...

42:19.830 --> 42:21.373
...major sins...

42:23.250 --> 42:25.294
The punishment is

42:26.045 --> 42:29.340
death by stoning.

42:36.840 --> 42:40.069
You played football; do you know it's prohibited ?

42:41.268 --> 42:43.896
Did you know football is prohibited ?

42:44.294 --> 42:44.858
Yes.

42:47.157 --> 42:54.748
Since you knew that football is prohibited, you are sentenced to 20 lashes.

42:55.199 --> 42:57.451
Because you knew that it's prohibited,

42:57.618 --> 43:00.204
you will be punished with 20 lashes.

45:01.784 --> 45:03.118
You bastard!

45:03.786 --> 45:06.872
Amadou, is the water yours or your grandfather's ?

45:08.123 --> 45:09.875
By what right?

45:11.377 --> 45:14.213
Are you crazy or what?

45:15.798 --> 45:17.174
What are you doing?

48:48.844 --> 48:50.721
Peace be upon you, Abdelkrim.

48:50.887 --> 48:52.347
Hello.

48:52.514 --> 48:54.933
Peace be upon you also Abu Jaafar.

48:55.309 --> 48:58.312
There was a murder here.

48:58.729 --> 49:00.272
What ?

49:00.439 --> 49:02.107
There was a murder here.

49:02.274 --> 49:06.403
Your Arabic is incomprehensible.

49:07.070 --> 49:08.822
Speak in English. 

49:08.989 --> 49:10.616
There was a murder here.

49:11.241 --> 49:12.576
No, no, no... tell me in English!

49:13.744 --> 49:14.703
Ok, sir.

49:14.870 --> 49:17.664
I say that somebody killed somebody here.

49:18.332 --> 49:19.374
What ?

49:19.875 --> 49:20.959
Who killed who?

49:22.919 --> 49:25.088
Somebody killed somebody here.

49:26.131 --> 49:27.382
I will call you back.

49:42.311 --> 49:43.364
Peace be upon you.

49:43.815 --> 49:44.816
Your name?

49:45.442 --> 49:46.234
Kidane.

49:46.401 --> 49:47.569
Do you have a gun?

49:53.033 --> 49:54.159
Your phone too.

49:57.829 --> 49:58.538
Go up.

50:50.924 --> 50:54.052
Mom, when will daddy return?

50:55.679 --> 50:56.888
Soon.

50:57.597 --> 51:00.225
Let's wait where there's network signal.

52:03.330 --> 52:06.291
Call my wife, I want to let her know.

52:06.458 --> 52:07.793
I do not understand!

52:10.086 --> 52:13.173
Who speaks Tamasheq here? Please, help me!

52:21.219 --> 52:23.334
Peace be upon you.

52:23.475 --> 52:25.185
Please, call my wife.

52:25.811 --> 52:27.229
Her name is Satima.

52:29.064 --> 52:33.360
At 70 52 52 11.

52:33.944 --> 52:36.905
I promised. They have no news.

52:39.449 --> 52:43.537
70 52 52...

52:44.871 --> 52:46.289
May God help you.

54:34.619 --> 54:38.513
<i>This is my land and this is my Timbuktu...</i>

54:45.377 --> 54:47.819
<i>It's children are mourning and suffering</i>

54:49.207 --> 54:52.344
<i>It's the land of love and warmth and dignity</i>

55:10.644 --> 55:16.856
<i>So tell me, why are the children crying ?</i>

55:20.177 --> 55:23.769
<i>Because of the injustice, violence, and fear of the future</i>

55:25.639 --> 55:29.105
<i>Stop crying, my Timbuktu will always be here</i>

55:51.850 --> 55:53.852
Everything will go very fast.

55:54.227 --> 55:55.854
You've got little time left.

55:57.439 --> 55:59.357
You will be judged very quickly.

56:03.862 --> 56:05.822
Sharia law will be applied.

56:11.828 --> 56:16.249
The judge is a just man, he will apply the law of God.

56:22.005 --> 56:24.549
You will have to obtain forgiveness

56:25.592 --> 56:27.135
from the family of Amadou.

56:33.099 --> 56:35.435
We will also settle the price of blood.

56:42.192 --> 56:44.069
Do you have cattle?

56:47.197 --> 56:48.990
Tell him I had eight cows.

56:49.699 --> 56:51.367
GPS is dead.

56:52.452 --> 56:54.329
I only have seven left.

56:55.955 --> 57:01.419
He said he had eight cows but one was killed.

57:05.256 --> 57:09.219
Regardless, he has to give at least forty.

57:09.803 --> 57:12.639
You will be required to give forty cows.

57:13.848 --> 57:17.268
You are a stockbreeder, you have cattle.

57:19.646 --> 57:21.106
Forty cows?

57:21.815 --> 57:22.732
Exactly.

57:25.151 --> 57:27.779
I cannot stop fate.

57:29.197 --> 57:31.866
My life is in the hands of God.

57:39.499 --> 57:40.458
That is right.

57:52.804 --> 57:55.597
Now, I would like...

57:58.726 --> 58:00.311
to ask him a question.

58:02.438 --> 58:06.067
No disrespect. I just want to know ...

58:16.578 --> 58:17.662
Go on.

58:20.790 --> 58:23.918
Tell him I want to know

58:24.252 --> 58:25.628
if he has children.

58:41.394 --> 58:44.397
God blessed him with two,

58:44.564 --> 58:46.774
one is a boy of eight.

58:57.660 --> 59:00.371
The Almighty has given me a single girl,

59:00.538 --> 59:02.498
which is twelve

59:02.665 --> 59:04.250
and she is called Toya.

59:20.892 --> 59:23.269
She is everything to me.

59:24.562 --> 59:26.731
She brings me milk to drink in the morning.

59:28.107 --> 59:31.444
She brings the cattle back at dusk.

59:32.320 --> 59:34.489
I have nothing in life

59:36.407 --> 59:38.451
that is more precious than her.

59:57.553 --> 59:59.472
God gave him a boy.

59:59.639 --> 01:00:02.308
I have not had that chance,

01:00:02.475 --> 01:00:04.894
He only gave me a girl.

01:00:05.311 --> 01:00:07.939
But she fills my whole being.

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:25.581
I speak to you.

01:00:26.416 --> 01:00:27.333
Tell me.

01:00:27.959 --> 01:00:30.086
You look like someone I know.

01:00:30.628 --> 01:00:31.629
Like who ?

01:00:34.882 --> 01:00:38.177
Mohamed Ag Elgimit, of the tribe Kel Assouk,

01:00:38.511 --> 01:00:39.595
of Lere.

01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:43.391
I do not know him.

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:46.352
I come from the green country,

01:00:46.644 --> 01:00:47.770
from Libya.

01:00:49.147 --> 01:00:50.481
Libya?

01:00:50.773 --> 01:00:54.235
It was here that my family lived until now.

01:00:58.489 --> 01:01:00.408
What have you to do with these people?

01:01:02.493 --> 01:01:05.079
A long history connects us.

01:01:05.455 --> 01:01:07.498
They brought me here.

01:01:16.299 --> 01:01:18.134
What is written will be done.

01:01:18.301 --> 01:01:20.887
I am at peace with death.

01:01:24.557 --> 01:01:26.309
We are all His children.

01:01:30.104 --> 01:01:32.190
We must protect our children.

01:01:34.025 --> 01:01:36.110
My daughter will not be protected.

01:01:38.363 --> 01:01:41.449
That hurts my whole being.

01:01:42.325 --> 01:01:45.661
Down in the grave without knowing what will happen to her.

01:01:48.081 --> 01:01:50.375
Most of our relatives have already left.

01:01:52.752 --> 01:01:54.420
But in all this,

01:01:57.090 --> 01:01:59.175
since there is only one God,

01:02:00.676 --> 01:02:01.969
I worship,

01:02:05.932 --> 01:02:08.184
He will make justice.

01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:12.897
No one escapes his fate.

01:02:32.333 --> 01:02:35.420
Tell him that it's not death that scares me

01:02:35.962 --> 01:02:39.048
but not being able to look back

01:02:39.715 --> 01:02:41.259
and find her face.

01:02:42.468 --> 01:02:45.972
Not seeing her before I die, it hurts.

01:03:09.787 --> 01:03:11.414
Knowing that his daughter

01:03:11.664 --> 01:03:14.917
will soon be an orphan

01:03:15.084 --> 01:03:16.752
really makes me sad,

01:03:17.044 --> 01:03:18.963
but do not translate that.

01:03:19.130 --> 01:03:20.089
Understood.

01:04:51.097 --> 01:04:56.642
Do you know that yesterday evening 
you were caught in a room playing music ?

01:04:57.770 --> 01:04:58.688
Yes.

01:04:58.854 --> 01:05:00.356
Do you know it's prohibited ?

01:05:01.107 --> 01:05:02.024
Yes.

01:05:03.859 --> 01:05:05.361
Since your parents were not present,

01:05:05.528 --> 01:05:07.405
you will be convicted to forty lashes

01:05:07.572 --> 01:05:09.657
for playing music,

01:05:09.824 --> 01:05:12.867
and another forty for meeting by yourselves.

01:07:28.087 --> 01:07:29.296
Look what I found.

01:07:31.799 --> 01:07:32.842
Abdelkrim...

01:07:34.468 --> 01:07:36.262
Everyone knows that you smoke.

01:07:37.263 --> 01:07:39.390
There's no need to hide from me.

01:07:54.864 --> 01:07:55.948
Who told you that I smoke ?

01:08:14.925 --> 01:08:17.303
It was twelfth of January -

01:08:18.011 --> 01:08:22.057
2010, six fifty three in the afternoon, exactly

01:08:22.224 --> 01:08:24.059
the same time as Miami.

01:08:24.225 --> 01:08:27.897
At six fifty three, time of Port-au-Prince, Haiti,

01:08:28.314 --> 01:08:29.814
the Earth trembled,

01:08:29.982 --> 01:08:31.734
and I found myself here,

01:08:31.901 --> 01:08:36.529
at precisely nine fifty three.

01:08:36.697 --> 01:08:39.992
Nine fifty three from Gonaives, Haiti, is that right ?

01:08:41.868 --> 01:08:44.662
You've been there before

01:08:45.331 --> 01:08:47.082
Take this, it's for you.

01:08:47.249 --> 01:08:49.877
- It will bring you luck.
- Thank you.

01:08:52.129 --> 01:08:54.173
Regardless the passage of time,

01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:56.008
the trembling of the earth is my body,

01:08:56.258 --> 01:08:58.010
I am the cracks !

01:08:58.761 --> 01:09:00.720
Cracks everywhere from my head to my feet

01:09:00.888 --> 01:09:03.890
From my head to my feet to my stomach to my arms to my ass.

01:09:04.058 --> 01:09:05.518
On my face.

01:09:06.310 --> 01:09:07.937
Regardless of weather...

01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:10.439
I am cracked.

01:09:10.939 --> 01:09:12.899
Me and Gonaives both,

01:09:13.067 --> 01:09:15.236
filled with cracks.

01:09:15.402 --> 01:09:17.863
Come baby, come.

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:25.246
- Do you speak French ?
- Yes.

01:09:25.412 --> 01:09:26.205
Cover your face.

01:09:28.541 --> 01:09:31.042
- What are you doing here ?
- Nothing.

01:09:31.710 --> 01:09:32.377
Nothing ?

01:09:32.545 --> 01:09:35.171
- I said what are you doing here ?
- I was talking on the phone.

01:09:35.631 --> 01:09:36.799
With who ?

01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:38.884
With my brother.

01:09:39.051 --> 01:09:40.219
You lie.

01:09:40.386 --> 01:09:42.638
I told you I was talking with my brother, you say I lie.

01:09:42.805 --> 01:09:44.723
It's a lie, take her.

01:09:45.558 --> 01:09:48.352
Don't touch me, don't touch me !

01:13:14.349 --> 01:13:16.310
Abu Jaafar, speak please.

01:13:35.079 --> 01:13:36.080
He says

01:13:36.497 --> 01:13:38.832
he saw the girl in town,

01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:42.669
she has a decent behavior and she's a beautiful girl

01:13:42.836 --> 01:13:45.881
and he wants to marry her.

01:13:52.638 --> 01:13:53.597
She says

01:13:54.556 --> 01:13:56.767
that this way of doing things is not right.

01:13:56.934 --> 01:13:58.393
Not with the tradition.

01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:01.313
And the father was not there.

01:14:22.626 --> 01:14:23.544
He said:

01:14:23.919 --> 01:14:24.878
why?

01:14:25.838 --> 01:14:28.173
He asks why.

01:14:28.882 --> 01:14:30.008
Why?

01:14:30.467 --> 01:14:32.719
Why should I give my daughter

01:14:32.886 --> 01:14:35.472
to a stranger?

01:14:35.639 --> 01:14:38.600
Who is he for me to give him my daughter?

01:14:57.452 --> 01:14:58.328
He came

01:14:59.413 --> 01:15:01.415
peacefully.

01:15:01.874 --> 01:15:04.293
Your refusal obliges him

01:15:04.751 --> 01:15:07.713
to use the force.

01:15:08.547 --> 01:15:10.674
I'm not afraid of him.

01:15:10.841 --> 01:15:12.885
I'm afraid of God.

01:15:29.151 --> 01:15:32.571
He goes away now.

01:15:32.738 --> 01:15:35.908
He will use force if necessary.

01:16:15.822 --> 01:16:17.115
It's good.

01:16:19.326 --> 01:16:21.370
Good, good.

01:16:21.536 --> 01:16:22.871
Did you see that ?

01:16:23.038 --> 01:16:28.585
- Is it good ?
- Yes, God bless you.

01:16:43.809 --> 01:16:44.810
33...

01:16:45.394 --> 01:16:46.270
34...

01:16:48.605 --> 01:16:49.439
35...

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:52.526
36...

01:16:53.986 --> 01:16:55.028
37...

01:16:56.363 --> 01:16:57.447
38...

01:16:58.865 --> 01:16:59.908
39...

01:17:00.867 --> 01:17:01.952
40.

01:17:11.336 --> 01:17:13.005
Hello.

01:17:17.259 --> 01:17:18.844
No network...

01:17:23.515 --> 01:17:27.227
Hello... hello...

01:17:39.865 --> 01:17:42.409
Peace be upon you.

01:18:21.615 --> 01:18:25.786
And upon you Peace.

01:18:23.079 --> 01:18:27.373
Please ask the mother of Amadou if she forgives the killer or not.

01:18:29.539 --> 01:18:33.585
I do not forgive. His death made me too ill.

01:18:33.752 --> 01:18:36.046
Maybe tomorrow, but not today.

01:18:37.506 --> 01:18:38.840
It felt too bad.

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:41.343
His blood is still warm.

01:18:42.344 --> 01:18:45.180
She will not forgive, she is still in shock.

01:19:19.756 --> 01:19:21.341
Ask him to raise his head.

01:19:21.967 --> 01:19:22.801
Raise your head !

01:19:27.514 --> 01:19:28.432
Satima.

01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:33.186
I'm listening.

01:19:33.895 --> 01:19:36.064
I am the driver of Abdelkrim.

01:19:37.232 --> 01:19:39.443
I have a message from him.

01:19:40.485 --> 01:19:42.154
There is nothing he can do.

01:19:43.572 --> 01:19:44.781
It's over.

01:20:15.103 --> 01:20:16.188
Tell him ...

01:20:18.023 --> 01:20:21.193
the death of Amadou hurt me badly.

01:20:23.069 --> 01:20:24.654
I did not want it.

01:20:27.282 --> 01:20:29.701
As the sun rose this morning

01:20:31.495 --> 01:20:35.248
and that I am still alive,

01:20:35.832 --> 01:20:38.001
another day that God gave me,

01:20:38.376 --> 01:20:40.170
what is going to happen,

01:20:40.754 --> 01:20:41.922
I accept it.

01:20:46.551 --> 01:20:49.262
Only one thing I will miss.

01:20:52.098 --> 01:20:53.517
A face.

01:20:55.227 --> 01:20:56.811
The face of my daughter,

01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:00.106
that of my wife.

01:21:03.485 --> 01:21:05.278
I ask God ...

01:21:06.321 --> 01:21:07.989
If you have children,

01:21:09.991 --> 01:21:11.076
it will help you

01:21:14.913 --> 01:21:16.831
to understand my pain.

01:21:19.543 --> 01:21:21.711
I do not fear the death you give me.

01:21:21.878 --> 01:21:23.547
It has a place in me.

01:21:25.715 --> 01:21:28.552
As you say, follow the law of Allah,

01:21:30.512 --> 01:21:31.388
do it.

01:21:33.390 --> 01:21:34.474
I'm ready.

01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:23.607
You gave her daughter in marriage

01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:26.067
to one of you,

01:22:26.484 --> 01:22:30.363
without her consent or the presence of her guardian.

01:22:30.864 --> 01:22:32.240
I had already asked

01:22:33.783 --> 01:22:37.078
my brother here

01:22:37.621 --> 01:22:39.372
to convey to you the case.

01:22:40.624 --> 01:22:42.083
This action

01:22:43.543 --> 01:22:45.420
was improvised during the night,

01:22:46.546 --> 01:22:48.715
under the cover of darkness,

01:22:48.882 --> 01:22:51.134
which is legally unacceptable.

01:22:52.761 --> 01:22:54.804
Regarding her daughter 

01:22:56.931 --> 01:23:00.560
you have married her without her consent

01:23:01.436 --> 01:23:03.605
to one of your young men ...

01:23:05.523 --> 01:23:06.650
My sister,

01:23:06.941 --> 01:23:10.654
what is the name the person who imposed the marriage?

01:23:10.904 --> 01:23:12.447
His name is Abu Jaafar.

01:23:13.698 --> 01:23:16.201
She says he is called Abu Jaafar.

01:23:18.328 --> 01:23:19.454
That is why

01:23:19.746 --> 01:23:21.831
I preferred to come myself

01:23:22.123 --> 01:23:25.210
to explain the issue

01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:27.629
this case,

01:23:29.214 --> 01:23:32.717
and for you to clarify your position.

01:23:33.343 --> 01:23:34.302
That's right.

01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:38.973
We have married Fatima ...

01:23:39.307 --> 01:23:40.850
Her name is Safia.

01:23:41.476 --> 01:23:43.645
Safia, with Abu Jaafar.

01:23:45.355 --> 01:23:46.815
It was a wedding ...

01:23:49.067 --> 01:23:50.068
legal.

01:23:51.236 --> 01:23:53.446
Based on Islamic law.

01:23:54.823 --> 01:23:57.617
Regarding the absence of the guardian,

01:23:58.618 --> 01:23:59.994
we are here

01:24:00.745 --> 01:24:02.455
the guardians of any action

01:24:03.748 --> 01:24:06.167
since we act in this territory.

01:24:07.961 --> 01:24:11.423
We married Abu Jaafar

01:24:14.843 --> 01:24:17.762
taking inspiration the words of the Prophet ...

01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:22.183
"If anyone comes to you and you recognize his faith,

01:24:22.559 --> 01:24:23.643
"Marry him."

01:24:24.602 --> 01:24:27.439
Abu Jaafar is a pious young man,

01:24:27.772 --> 01:24:30.316
a dove of the mosques, a fighter,

01:24:32.652 --> 01:24:33.653
he is perfect.

01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:38.116
On this basis, we have married them

01:24:38.700 --> 01:24:41.077
and it's a perfect marriage.

01:24:42.162 --> 01:24:44.164
The case was repeated

01:24:45.373 --> 01:24:47.751
more than once in Timbuktu

01:24:48.334 --> 01:24:50.253
this has troubled the people

01:24:50.962 --> 01:24:52.881
and caused

01:24:53.298 --> 01:24:55.633
many frustrations and anxieties.

01:24:56.134 --> 01:24:57.886
We do not see

01:24:58.470 --> 01:25:02.682
frustration or anything like that.

01:25:03.683 --> 01:25:05.602
We apply the law of Allah

01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:09.022
and the Sunnah of the Prophet, peace be upon him.

01:25:09.606 --> 01:25:11.858
We have consulted

01:25:13.985 --> 01:25:15.528
and acted

01:25:16.112 --> 01:25:18.448
with full legality.

01:29:21.232 --> 01:29:22.608
Mecca is in that direction.

01:29:23.818 --> 01:29:24.777
I know.

01:29:26.029 --> 01:29:29.824
My daughter and her mother are there.

01:30:03.816 --> 01:30:05.860
Get me the motorcyclist !

01:32:12.889 --> 01:32:17.571
