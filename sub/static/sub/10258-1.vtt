00:54.810 --> 00:57.400
I want to tell you my story.

00:57.980 --> 00:59.230
What the hell?

00:59.400 --> 01:02.070

01:31.220 --> 01:35.060

Sit down Oh Dae-su.
You've had too much to drink.

01:52.080 --> 01:53.830

02:30.620 --> 02:34.160
.."getting through
one day at a time."

02:34.330 --> 02:36.540
That's what "Oh Dae-su" means.

02:37.170 --> 02:38.960
But...God...

02:39.960 --> 02:43.170
Why can't I get through today?

Grab him!

03:15.120 --> 03:16.450

and cause trouble again.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.590

06:20.890 --> 06:23.140
I have a right to know why.

06:23.310 --> 06:26.440

Son of a bitch!

07:16.150 --> 07:18.150

07:20.410 --> 07:24.120
<i>If they had told me then</i>
<i>that it would be 15 years...</i>

07:25.290 --> 07:27.580
<i>..would it have been</i>
<i>easier to endure?</i>

07:29.540 --> 07:31.170
<i>Or harder?</i>

07:32.290 --> 07:34.590
LAUGH
AND THE WORLD LAUGHS WITH YOU.

07:34.750 --> 07:36.420
WEEP AND YOU WEEP ALONE.

07:43.140 --> 07:45.640
<i>When the music begins</i>
<i>gas is released.</i>

07:55.480 --> 07:58.440
<i>When the gas is released</i>
<i>I fall asleep.</i>

08:04.030 --> 08:05.540
<i>Later on I found out</i>

08:06.490 --> 08:10.620
<i>that it was the same valium gas</i>
<i>that Russian soldiers used</i>

08:10.790 --> 08:12.630
<i>on Chechen terrorists.</i>

08:20.380 --> 08:22.640
<i>When I wake up</i>
<i>my hair has been cut.</i>

08:23.390 --> 08:25.430
<i>I don't really like the style.</i>

08:27.270 --> 08:31.890
<i>But they change my clothes</i>
<i>and clean the room.</i>

08:33.480 --> 08:34.809
<i>Generous bastards.</i>

08:37.980 --> 08:39.150
<i>One!</i>

08:40.700 --> 08:41.530
<i>Two!</i>

08:44.070 --> 08:45.530
<i>Three!</i>

08:46.700 --> 08:49.410
<i>It's too spicy.</i>

08:49.580 --> 08:52.620
I don't want spinach. You eat it.
I won't eat spinach.

08:56.750 --> 09:00.420
<i>Mrs Kim Ja-hyun's body was found</i>
<i>with stab wounds to the neck.</i>

09:00.590 --> 09:03.220
<i>This was a cold-blooded murder.</i>

09:03.430 --> 09:06.180
<i>As nothing of value was taken</i>

09:06.390 --> 09:08.390
<i>police suspect a personal motive.</i>

09:08.720 --> 09:10.850
<i>The victim's husband Oh Dae-su</i>

09:11.060 --> 09:13.440
<i>disappeared a year ago</i>
<i>and is still at large.</i>

09:13.600 --> 09:16.190
<i>Witnesses say</i>
<i>Oh Dae-su was a heavy drinker</i>

09:16.400 --> 09:19.230
<i>who fought constantly with his wife.</i>

09:19.400 --> 09:22.320
<i>Neighbours also frequently argued</i>
<i>with Oh Dae-su.</i>

09:23.400 --> 09:27.740
<i>Blood samples found at the scene</i>
<i>match those of Oh Dae-su.</i>

09:27.910 --> 09:32.660
<i>Oh Dae-su's fingerprints have been</i>
<i>matched to those found on a cup.</i>

09:32.830 --> 09:37.880
<i>Sources claim that Oh Dae-su</i>
<i>definitely visited his wife recently.</i>

09:39.590 --> 09:40.920
<i>The only missing item</i>

09:41.130 --> 09:44.180
<i>was a family album</i>
<i>which backs the police theories.</i>

10:16.870 --> 10:18.920
<i>After three years</i>

10:19.090 --> 10:22.380
<i>many wrinkles form on a man's face.</i>

10:34.600 --> 10:39.560
<i>If you stand</i>
<i>outside a phone box on a rainy day...</i>

10:40.860 --> 10:44.150
<i>..and meet a man whose face</i>
<i>is hidden by a violet umbrella</i>

10:44.360 --> 10:46.030
<i>my advice is</i>

10:46.200 --> 10:48.950
<i>that you make friends</i>
<i>with television.</i>

10:50.280 --> 10:52.740
<i>The television</i>
<i>is both clock and calendar.</i>

10:53.580 --> 10:57.170
<i>It is your school home church</i>

10:57.750 --> 10:58.830
<i>friend...</i>

11:00.080 --> 11:01.210
<i>..and lover.</i>

11:02.340 --> 11:03.380
<i>But...</i>

11:25.990 --> 11:26.940
<i>But...</i>

11:27.780 --> 11:29.450
<i>..my lover's song...</i>

11:31.530 --> 11:32.830
<i>..is too short.</i>

11:41.170 --> 11:44.500
<i>Today at 7.:50am</i>
<i>the middle of Seoul's Sangsu Bridge</i>

11:44.710 --> 11:47.630
<i>50 metres in length</i>
<i>suddenly collapsed...</i>

11:47.800 --> 11:49.840
<i>I wrote a list</i>

11:50.010 --> 11:53.680
<i>of all the people I had offended</i>
<i>quarrelled with and hurt.</i>

11:57.270 --> 12:00.020
<i>This was both my prison journal</i>

12:00.730 --> 12:03.060
<i>and the autobiography</i>
<i>of my evil deeds.</i>

12:05.650 --> 12:08.440
<i>I thought I had lived</i>
<i>a normal life...</i>

12:12.120 --> 12:14.330
<i>..but there was too much wrong-doing.</i>

12:21.080 --> 12:24.420
<i>All I could think at that moment</i>

12:25.550 --> 12:27.710
<i>was that the man in the next room</i>

12:27.880 --> 12:30.050
<i>probably only had one chopstick.</i>

12:32.300 --> 12:33.340
<i>But...</i>

12:35.640 --> 12:36.470
<i>But...</i>

12:44.650 --> 12:45.900
<i>Who had imprisoned me?</i>

12:48.190 --> 12:49.990
<i>Was it Yoo Heung-sam?</i>

12:50.150 --> 12:52.780
<i>Lee So-young or Kang Chang-suk?</i>

12:53.530 --> 12:55.620
<i>Whoever it was wait.</i>

12:56.950 --> 12:58.660
<i>Just you wait.</i>

12:59.540 --> 13:02.250
<i>I'll rip your body limb from limb</i>

13:02.420 --> 13:06.250
<i>and your remains will never be found.</i>

13:06.960 --> 13:09.840
<i>Because I will swallow</i>
<i>every last bit.</i>

13:32.990 --> 13:34.780
<i>One line for each year.</i>

13:36.530 --> 13:40.120
<i>When I start doing this</i>
<i>I am already six lines behind.</i>

13:42.210 --> 13:43.620
<i>So next year will be easier.</i>

13:46.670 --> 13:49.840
<i>The more tattoos I have</i>
<i>the shorter the chopstick becomes.</i>

13:52.130 --> 13:54.300
<i>The shorter the chopstick becomes</i>

13:54.470 --> 13:56.590
<i>the bigger the hole in the wall</i>
<i>becomes.</i>

13:58.140 --> 13:59.430
<i>Anyway...</i>

14:01.020 --> 14:02.730
<i>..time passes well.</i>

14:08.110 --> 14:09.520
<i>Nine years.</i>

14:14.610 --> 14:15.950
<i>10 years.</i>

lying in a field.

17:10.290 --> 17:11.910
When you hear the bell...

17:13.460 --> 17:15.329
..you will turn your head...

17:16.500 --> 17:18.339
..and look down.

17:21.970 --> 17:23.300
You will see

17:24.050 --> 17:26.349
an endless field of green grass.

17:28.970 --> 17:30.850
The sun is shining brightly...

Mister.

I see.

21:02.520 --> 21:05.610

21:08.650 --> 21:09.780
The reason...

<i>Because they say</i>
<i>I murdered my wife.</i>

22:19.720 --> 22:21.270
<i>I am a fugitive.</i>

22:47.330 --> 22:48.710
You dickshit!

23:00.720 --> 23:01.890
<i>Dickshit...</i>

23:03.270 --> 23:04.680
<i>A new word.</i>

23:06.810 --> 23:09.480
<i>Television doesn't teach you</i>
<i>swear words.</i>

23:17.610 --> 23:23.290
<i>Can 15 years' worth of</i>
<i>imaginary training be put to use?</i>

23:34.550 --> 23:36.010
<i>Apparently it can.</i>

23:38.380 --> 23:39.840
<i>Rock Bream.</i>

23:40.010 --> 23:42.890
<i>Oplegnathus fasciatus.</i>

23:43.720 --> 23:46.350
<i>Lives in the warm waters</i>
<i>of coastal reefs.</i>

23:47.270 --> 23:49.230
<i>This fish has weak reflexes</i>

23:49.400 --> 23:52.900
<i>but can resist powerfully</i>
<i>when caught in a hook.</i>

23:53.480 --> 23:56.360
<i>In the Kyungsang Province</i>
<i>its offspring...</i>

23:57.240 --> 23:59.280
<i>What is that smell?</i>

24:11.460 --> 24:14.630
Don't bother
asking me any questions.

24:15.460 --> 24:17.170
I don't know anything.

24:35.270 --> 24:36.900
Yes?

24:39.030 --> 24:43.030
I said... I want to eat...
a living thing.

24:46.540 --> 24:49.540
Oh... right.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.120
Long time no see.

24:51.500 --> 24:54.090
<i>This is my first time here.</i>

24:54.250 --> 24:55.460
Maybe I'm wrong.

24:55.710 --> 24:57.630
<i>But she looks familiar.</i>

24:59.260 --> 25:03.680
You look very familiar.
Have we met before?

25:04.300 --> 25:07.010
"Search for the Best Chef."

25:07.680 --> 25:09.640
"Thursdays at 6:30 on MBC."

25:09.810 --> 25:12.690
"The youngest female chef
of Japanese cuisine."

25:12.850 --> 25:13.900
Oh that?

25:15.110 --> 25:18.400
They said the ratings are low
but someone must watch it.

25:18.570 --> 25:22.160
Women's hands are usually warm
so they cannot make sushi.

25:22.320 --> 25:24.870
Well you certainly know your stuff.

25:38.170 --> 25:39.340
Who are you?

25:43.090 --> 25:44.680
<i>Do you</i>

25:44.840 --> 25:46.100
<i>like your clothes?</i>

25:52.730 --> 25:54.100
Why?

25:56.520 --> 25:59.480
- Why did you imprison me?
<i>- Who do you think I am?</i>

26:01.900 --> 26:03.780
- Yoo Heung-sam?
<i>- Wrong.</i>

26:04.490 --> 26:07.660
- Did Lee So-young pay you?
<i>- Wrong again.</i>

26:08.370 --> 26:09.410
Lee Jong-yong?

26:10.500 --> 26:11.540
Kang Chang-suk?

26:12.580 --> 26:14.750
Hwang Joo-yeun? Kim Na-sung?

26:15.370 --> 26:18.840
Park Jin-woo? Im Duk-yoon?
Lee Jae-pyung? Kuk Su-ran?

26:19.050 --> 26:21.760
- Who the hell are you?
<i>- Me?</i>

26:22.300 --> 26:23.880
<i>I'm a sort of scholar.</i>

26:24.840 --> 26:26.510
<i>And my field of study is you.</i>

26:27.510 --> 26:29.810
<i>A scholar studying Oh Dae-su.</i>

26:29.970 --> 26:32.230
<i>An expert on Oh Dae-su.</i>

26:33.060 --> 26:36.020
<i>Who I am isn't important.</i>
<i>What's important is "why".</i>

26:36.190 --> 26:37.690
<i>Think hard.</i>

26:37.860 --> 26:39.820
<i>Study your whole lifetime.</i>

26:40.980 --> 26:44.450
<i>School has finished</i>
<i>now it's time for your homework.</i>

26:46.610 --> 26:47.870
<i>Keep this in mind.:</i>

26:48.910 --> 26:51.410
<i>"Whether it be a grain of sand</i>
<i>or a rock</i>

26:52.040 --> 26:54.040
<i>in water they both sink alike. "</i>

26:55.370 --> 26:56.750
Let me ask you one thing.

26:57.880 --> 27:01.710
You hypnotized me in there
didn't you?

27:03.130 --> 27:04.470
What did you do to me?

27:05.720 --> 27:07.220
<i>I miss you.</i>

27:08.140 --> 27:09.180
<i>Come quickly.</i>

27:20.820 --> 27:22.860
Here you are.

27:26.490 --> 27:27.610
It's alive OK?

27:29.490 --> 27:31.700
I'll go and slice it up for you.

28:07.740 --> 28:11.530
I must be a different breed of woman.
My hands are very cold.

28:13.160 --> 28:14.740
<i>What is she doing?</i>

28:20.120 --> 28:20.960
Sir.

28:22.670 --> 28:24.300
Sir wake up.

28:26.590 --> 28:27.880
<i>Keep this in mind.</i>

28:29.590 --> 28:32.680
<i>"Whether it be a grain of sand</i>
<i>or a rock...</i>

28:33.680 --> 28:37.270
<i>..in water they both sink alike. "</i>

28:43.820 --> 28:45.320
Are you awake?

28:55.830 --> 28:57.290
Is all this true?

29:18.770 --> 29:20.560
That fever remedy works well.

29:22.480 --> 29:26.020
Why did you faint if you've done
so much physical training?

29:28.030 --> 29:33.660
A lack of vital sunlight leaves one
depleted of vitamins A and E.

29:35.830 --> 29:38.660
Thus one's immunity to influenza
is weakened.

29:41.080 --> 29:42.960
Do you always talk like that?

29:56.180 --> 29:58.970
The lock on the bathroom door
is broken.

29:59.140 --> 30:00.640
Don't get any bright ideas

30:00.810 --> 30:02.730
or I'll gut you like a fish.

30:05.150 --> 30:06.190
What's this?

30:07.270 --> 30:11.400
Suppositories. You fainted so
how else could I give you medicine?

30:26.500 --> 30:30.920
<i>Can 15 years' worth of</i>
<i>imaginary training be put to use?</i>

30:39.010 --> 30:40.140
<i>Apparently not.</i>

30:56.320 --> 30:58.240
That was an unforgivable sin.

31:02.370 --> 31:06.750
I brought you back here
and then turned you down.

31:07.580 --> 31:09.170
I can see why you're angry.

31:10.340 --> 31:11.590
I really can.

31:15.170 --> 31:19.180
You know I brought you here
because I like you.

31:20.100 --> 31:21.260
But...

31:24.020 --> 31:26.100
You don't even know my name yet.

31:27.150 --> 31:28.310
It's Mido.

31:29.900 --> 31:31.110
You see...

31:32.730 --> 31:33.940
..later on...

31:35.650 --> 31:37.360
..when I'm really ready...

31:38.780 --> 31:41.490
..I swear on my life
that I'll go through with it.

31:43.080 --> 31:46.710
That song in your diary <i>The Face</i>
<i>I Want to See</i>  that will be the sign.

31:47.460 --> 31:49.170
When I sing it

31:49.330 --> 31:52.340
get ready.

31:54.380 --> 31:58.510
I may try to resist you again

31:58.680 --> 32:00.890
in the heat of the moment.

32:01.930 --> 32:04.350
But no matter what don't stop.

32:04.520 --> 32:07.350
Just give it to me!

32:09.980 --> 32:11.150
Give it...

32:13.070 --> 32:14.530
..to me.

32:20.360 --> 32:21.910
The ants...

32:23.080 --> 32:24.450
Do you still see them?

32:25.660 --> 32:27.290
Do you still feel that way?

32:29.080 --> 32:32.420
Yeah if you're alone you see ants.

32:33.590 --> 32:38.720
People I have met who are very lonely
have all hallucinated about ants.

32:40.340 --> 32:42.350
I tried once to work out why.

32:42.510 --> 32:45.470
Ants move around in groups
you know.

32:46.470 --> 32:50.480
So I suppose very lonely people
keep thinking of ants.

32:51.940 --> 32:54.400
Although I have never done that.

33:57.300 --> 34:00.340
<i>She called from overseas</i>
<i>five or six years ago</i>

34:00.510 --> 34:02.300
<i>asking if her dad had come back.</i>

34:03.090 --> 34:07.010
<i>She doesn't even know</i>
<i>that he killed her mother.</i>

34:07.560 --> 34:11.020
She has hardly any relatives
so she calls us.

34:12.389 --> 34:14.810
Her Korean has got worse.

34:16.610 --> 34:19.570
I think her Swedish foster parents
are both doctors.

34:22.739 --> 34:24.449
You journalists must know...

34:27.159 --> 34:29.239
Dae-su...

34:29.409 --> 34:31.909
Is he really still on the run?

34:36.170 --> 34:39.090
Your daughter's address
is on the front

34:39.250 --> 34:41.840
and on the back is a map of
your wife's grave.

34:45.800 --> 34:46.840
<i>Eva...</i>

34:47.800 --> 34:49.060
<i>Stockholm...</i>

34:49.850 --> 34:50.770
<i>Eva...</i>

34:52.350 --> 34:53.810
Do you want to call her?

35:01.150 --> 35:02.610
Shall I call her?

35:08.620 --> 35:10.700
Shall we visit the grave tomorrow?

35:17.290 --> 35:21.300
<i>No first I have to kill</i>
<i>that bastard.</i>

35:48.200 --> 35:49.950
BLUE DRAGON

35:52.240 --> 35:53.660
Well?

35:53.830 --> 35:55.910
<i>I haven't tasted it yet.</i>

35:57.620 --> 35:59.750
BLUE DRAGON

36:02.210 --> 36:03.250
So?

36:05.050 --> 36:06.550
Did it taste the same?

36:20.020 --> 36:22.770
<i>I could taste food from</i>
<i>100 restaurants...</i>

36:25.150 --> 36:28.150
<i>..but I will never forget</i>
<i>the food I tasted for 15 years.</i>

36:35.750 --> 36:36.790
BLUE DRAGON

36:56.560 --> 36:59.020
Shall I create an ID for you
so you can log in?

36:59.770 --> 37:02.230
Do you have
a favourite film or song?

37:03.980 --> 37:08.030
I've already been talking...

37:09.280 --> 37:10.860
..to him...

37:17.870 --> 37:19.580
"The Count of Monte Cristo"?

37:21.790 --> 37:27.090
There's no one by that name here.

37:36.600 --> 37:39.140
HOW'S LIFE IN A BIGGER PRISON
OH DAE-SU?

37:39.430 --> 37:40.520
Who are you?

37:43.900 --> 37:46.820
Who are you?

37:47.980 --> 37:50.070
THE LONELY PRINCE IN THE HIGH
TOWER.

37:50.240 --> 37:51.280
Who is he?

37:56.950 --> 37:59.950
I don't know who he is.
I just chat to him sometimes.

38:00.660 --> 38:02.290
We talk about sushi.

38:12.550 --> 38:13.800
Where are you going?

38:21.890 --> 38:22.980
Where are you going?

38:23.390 --> 38:24.850
You are not to be trusted.

38:41.580 --> 38:43.580
- VIOL...
- BLUE DRAGON

38:43.790 --> 38:48.670
<i>Violet Blue Dragon...</i>
<i>What does that mean?</i>

39:01.350 --> 39:03.850
<i>Why did they order</i>
<i>from a place so far away?</i>

39:05.350 --> 39:07.980
<i>I've already passed</i>
<i>five Chinese restaurants.</i>

39:10.730 --> 39:13.360
<i>I think my lungs are</i>
<i>on the verge of exploding.</i>

39:20.240 --> 39:22.330
You there tell your cooks

39:22.500 --> 39:24.790
to put less scallions
in the dumplings.

39:26.290 --> 39:27.290
OK.

39:38.510 --> 39:40.300
- Leave it there and go.
- Yes sir.

40:18.090 --> 40:21.930
We don't take on anyone
who uses bodyguards.

40:22.100 --> 40:24.220
Some companies specialize in that.

40:25.140 --> 40:26.640
You should go to them.

40:27.560 --> 40:30.350
We just take the small fry.

40:31.610 --> 40:35.360
If the stay is over six months
transportation is free.

40:36.070 --> 40:38.110
Yes of course.

40:44.620 --> 40:46.410
Why did you imprison me you...

40:49.120 --> 40:50.830
..dickshit.

40:52.540 --> 40:55.250
In our business on floor 7½

40:56.460 --> 40:59.260
client confidentiality
is our livelihood.

41:17.650 --> 41:20.360
I am going to avenge myself
for all 15 years.

41:21.610 --> 41:24.780
Each tooth I extract
will age you by one year.

41:41.130 --> 41:42.180
Keep still.

41:49.980 --> 41:51.270
Do you want to talk?

42:13.120 --> 42:15.130
I don't know...

42:15.290 --> 42:18.000
I didn't see his face...

42:18.170 --> 42:20.880
I made recordings...

42:34.810 --> 42:36.310
OH DAE-SU

42:42.280 --> 42:44.990
All those who are blood-type AB
raise your hand.

42:58.090 --> 43:00.630
Go. Shoo!
He has lost a lot of blood.

43:53.770 --> 43:54.930
Piece of shit.

44:00.150 --> 44:01.650
Is he dead?

46:31.130 --> 46:32.800
<i>I can't seem to</i>

46:33.430 --> 46:35.800
<i>get through today either.</i>

46:37.560 --> 46:41.230
<i>Now I have become a monster.</i>

46:42.810 --> 46:44.730
<i>When my vengeance is over...</i>

46:46.020 --> 46:47.860
<i>..can I return to Oh Dae-su?</i>

46:53.650 --> 46:56.660
Mister are you alright?

46:56.820 --> 46:59.700
Look at all this blood.

46:59.870 --> 47:02.910
What happened to you?

47:08.420 --> 47:11.670
Saewoon Apartments Eung-am
building 8. Take care of him.

47:13.090 --> 47:14.130
Thank you.

47:15.010 --> 47:16.340
Not at all.

47:17.260 --> 47:19.260
Well then...

47:20.600 --> 47:21.850
Farewell Oh Dae-su.

47:25.850 --> 47:26.900
<i>Farewell...</i>

47:28.690 --> 47:30.270
<i>..Oh Dae-su.</i>

47:31.400 --> 47:32.440
<i>Farewell.</i>

47:34.400 --> 47:35.610
<i>Farewell.</i>

48:32.590 --> 48:34.760
<i>The bastard you hate</i>
<i>but don't dare kill.</i>

48:34.920 --> 48:38.050
<i>The bitch you detest</i>
<i>who deserves a fate worse than death.</i>

48:38.220 --> 48:39.800
<i>We are at your service.</i>

48:41.100 --> 48:44.100
<i>Won't he go crazy</i>
<i>if he's locked up for a long time?</i>

48:44.270 --> 48:49.310
<i>Well if you don't want that</i>
<i>we can drug his drinks.</i>

48:49.480 --> 48:52.480
<i>There's a thing</i>
<i>called 'Risterdal solution'.</i>

48:52.650 --> 48:56.150
<i>It's a reliable drug</i>
<i>used to treat schizophrenia.</i>

48:57.070 --> 49:00.280
<i>But it depends on the length</i>
<i>of the treatment</i>

49:00.450 --> 49:03.080
<i>so how long will he...</i>

49:03.240 --> 49:04.290
<i>15 years.</i>

49:06.500 --> 49:07.830
<i>Is that possible?</i>

49:08.000 --> 49:09.920
<i>What did he do?</i>

49:10.630 --> 49:12.210
<i>Oh Dae-su you see...</i>

49:13.540 --> 49:15.590
<i>..talks too much.</i>

49:17.970 --> 49:19.010
Go to sleep.

49:20.220 --> 49:23.430
Tomorrow you will visit
Joo-hwan's internet cafe.

49:33.770 --> 49:35.780
Sit wherever you like.

49:38.110 --> 49:39.150

49:51.040 --> 49:52.500
<i>Oh Dae-su you see...</i>

49:53.710 --> 49:55.040
<i>..talks too much.</i>

Have you heard this voice before?

50:02.680 --> 50:04.850
Who loathes me this much?

50:12.310 --> 50:14.690
Those 260 women you've had...

Joo-hwan...

50:44.680 --> 50:45.720
Did I...

..really talk too much?

50:52.350 --> 50:53.440
My friend...

50:53.600 --> 50:55.940

51:18.380 --> 51:22.220
CONGRATULATIONS YOUR CASE WAS
AUTOMATICALLY DISMISSED
YESTERDAY.

51:22.420 --> 51:24.180
But please remember this...

51:24.840 --> 51:26.050
Open quote.

51:27.970 --> 51:31.020
Like a gazelle
from the hand of the hunter...

51:31.180 --> 51:34.270
Like a bird
from the snare of the fowler...

51:35.480 --> 51:36.940
Free yourself.

51:40.860 --> 51:42.280
Close quote.

51:43.690 --> 51:45.780
Who are you? You bastard!

51:47.200 --> 51:49.330
<i>I decided when I was a prisoner</i>

51:49.490 --> 51:51.830
<i>that if I got out</i>
<i>I would trust no one.</i>

51:52.500 --> 51:54.870
<i>If I met anyone suspicious</i>

51:55.040 --> 51:57.750
<i>I would invent a secret</i>
<i>only known to the two of us.</i>

51:59.290 --> 52:02.420
That ID Monster is a trap
I designed to catch him.

52:03.550 --> 52:06.090
You let a stranger into your home.
Who are you?

52:16.730 --> 52:17.940
Who's Evergreen?

52:25.950 --> 52:29.950
<i>I tracked down that Evergreen ID</i>
<i>and found the owner's details.</i>

52:30.120 --> 52:32.490
- <i>Are you ready to jot it down?</i>
- Go ahead.

52:32.700 --> 52:35.910
<i>It's Su Dae-oh.</i>
<i>Does the surname 'Su' even exist?</i>

52:36.080 --> 52:39.710
- Address?
- <i>Saewoon Apartments in Eung-am.</i>

52:39.880 --> 52:41.380
<i>Building 7 flat 407.</i>

52:46.470 --> 52:48.430
<i>Actually life in a bigger prison</i>

52:48.590 --> 52:50.890
<i>does not suit me very well.</i>

53:09.610 --> 53:10.910
Evergreen.

53:12.780 --> 53:13.990
Who are you?

53:18.750 --> 53:20.420
Is that what you wanted to ask?

53:22.040 --> 53:25.000
No. You must find that out
for yourself.

53:25.170 --> 53:26.550
Come on it's a game.

53:27.470 --> 53:30.510
First " who?"
Then "why?"

53:31.590 --> 53:33.810
When you know the answer
come and see me.

53:34.180 --> 53:35.810
I'll mark your work.

53:35.970 --> 53:37.890
You have until July 5th.

53:39.980 --> 53:42.360
Oh no only five days left.

53:45.110 --> 53:46.150
Too short?

53:47.400 --> 53:48.860
Chin up.

53:49.030 --> 53:52.200
If you succeed
I'll kill myself instead of Mido.

53:55.620 --> 53:57.080
That's right Mido.

53:57.790 --> 53:59.620
I'm going to kill

53:59.790 --> 54:02.210
every woman you love until you die.

54:04.290 --> 54:05.670
Well you're notorious

54:05.840 --> 54:07.960
for not protecting your women anyway.

54:14.970 --> 54:18.270
Wow you're strong Mr Monster.

54:19.390 --> 54:21.640
Yes you are the monster
that I created.

54:24.270 --> 54:25.980
But you will never

54:26.150 --> 54:28.570
find out why
if you go through with this.

54:29.240 --> 54:31.490
You have been curious for 15 years...

54:32.240 --> 54:33.950
Are you still going to kill me?

54:43.620 --> 54:44.750
Sit down there.

54:52.130 --> 54:54.390
Ah the tooth torture!

54:56.260 --> 54:58.010
You won't have enough time.

54:59.100 --> 55:01.980
I have a pacemaker
for my weak heart.

55:03.100 --> 55:04.310
When it was put in...

55:06.360 --> 55:08.570
..do you know
what I said to the doctor?

55:11.860 --> 55:13.280
"Dr Hopkins

55:13.910 --> 55:15.240
give me...

55:16.530 --> 55:18.790
..a remote control
to turn my motor off."

55:19.200 --> 55:21.580
"Pardon? Why?"

55:24.420 --> 55:28.340
"So that I can kill myself. Easily.
At any time."

55:29.630 --> 55:32.170
"I'll pay you an extra $100000
for this."

55:47.310 --> 55:49.020
What a dilemma.

55:49.190 --> 55:52.110
You want to kill me right now

55:52.280 --> 55:54.900
but then you won't know
why you were imprisoned.

55:55.990 --> 55:59.580
You want to torture me
but I say I'll kill myself first.

56:01.950 --> 56:05.370
Revenge? Or the truth?

56:07.630 --> 56:10.340
What a problem for you.

56:11.090 --> 56:13.970
I've been watching over you
for 15 years.

56:16.220 --> 56:18.140
I've faired well thanks to you.

56:18.550 --> 56:21.930
I wasn't bored or lonely.

56:24.810 --> 56:28.730
Seeking revenge is the best cure
for someone who has been hurt.

56:28.900 --> 56:30.020
Try it.

56:31.940 --> 56:34.190
The loss of 15 years

56:35.070 --> 56:37.660
the pain of losing
your wife and child

56:37.820 --> 56:40.120
all this can be forgotten.

56:40.740 --> 56:44.500
Once again
revenge is good for your health.

56:45.120 --> 56:46.000
But...

56:47.620 --> 56:50.170
What happens
after you've had your revenge?

56:51.420 --> 56:54.880
I bet that hidden pain
probably emerges again.

56:58.300 --> 56:59.890
Are you there Oh Dae-su?

57:02.180 --> 57:03.350
Oh Dae-su.

57:04.390 --> 57:05.680
Long time no see.

57:14.900 --> 57:18.400
Hasn't she been tied up too long?
You left her door open.

57:32.340 --> 57:33.800
Save me Dae-su!

57:36.260 --> 57:37.800
<i>I can't. I'm going to die.</i>

57:47.980 --> 57:49.690
This dentist is very good.

57:58.570 --> 57:59.700
Keep still.

57:59.990 --> 58:02.160
Keep still.

58:03.280 --> 58:04.410
What's his problem?

58:33.480 --> 58:34.980
You see...

58:36.480 --> 58:38.570
..they say that people

58:39.360 --> 58:42.110
shrivel up
because of their imagination.

58:43.070 --> 58:46.280
So do not imagine anything.

58:47.240 --> 58:49.660
You'll become brave as hell.

58:50.330 --> 58:51.960
Now here comes the real thing.

59:24.490 --> 59:28.700
Sir I'm glad
you told me about this place...

59:30.240 --> 59:32.660
..but I haven't even started yet!

59:48.600 --> 59:49.640
Let's go.

01:00:06.610 --> 01:00:07.660
Let's go now.

01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:09.990
Let's fight.

01:00:13.370 --> 01:00:14.500
Let's fight.

01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:22.800
- What a tough guy!
- Your hand.

01:00:24.090 --> 01:00:25.760
I'll chop off your hand.

01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:31.010
You touched Mido's breasts.

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:37.810
Let's get out of this dump.

01:00:53.830 --> 01:00:56.370
So do you trust me now you bastard?

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:02.590
It looks hard to accomplish.

01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:04.340
I looked into it.

01:01:04.510 --> 01:01:07.340
The reason the bank
refused to pay $270 million

01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:10.050
was not due to
any building irregularities.

01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:11.930
They have internal problems.

01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:19.560
So I don't think
we'll have any trouble.

01:01:19.730 --> 01:01:25.070
Chairman Choi's
23 clients' shares are at 25% ...

01:01:32.450 --> 01:01:33.870
Dae-su.

01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:36.410
Yeah?

01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:42.460
Did he really say that he'd kill me?

01:01:44.590 --> 01:01:45.420
Yeah.

01:01:46.550 --> 01:01:49.010
Because I'm the woman you love?

01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:56.140
Dae-su.

01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:59.560
What?

01:02:00.730 --> 01:02:03.610
<i>Where is my love?</i>

01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:08.190
<i>I'm getting lonelier in the nights</i>

01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:14.780
<i>The words you send with your eyes</i>

01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:20.000
<i>I can feel with my hand</i>

01:02:21.330 --> 01:02:24.880
<i>So many nights have passed</i>

01:02:26.250 --> 01:02:29.550
<i>My heart is going to you</i>

01:02:31.050 --> 01:02:34.890
<i>As I shed my sad tears</i>

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:39.640
<i>You're the face I miss.</i>

01:02:44.610 --> 01:02:48.480
They packed up their stuff
and left in a rental car.

01:02:50.530 --> 01:02:54.870
Also Mido called the restaurant
and left her job.

01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:00.910
Let's go after this is done.

01:03:03.330 --> 01:03:05.380
You should get some rest today sir.

01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:09.210
I can't even sleep.

01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:12.010
Because I am lonely.

01:03:12.970 --> 01:03:14.220
Mr Han.

01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:17.560
Do you really think...

01:03:18.850 --> 01:03:21.430
..that Mido has fallen in love
with Oh Dae-su?

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:24.980
Already?

01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:46.670
Dae-su!

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:49.300
It hurts so much.

01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:52.510
But I'll endure it.

01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:55.430
You must understand.

01:04:10.690 --> 01:04:13.530
How did you hold out for 15 years?

01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:15.660
There's always a way.

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:18.950
Do you like it?

01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:22.200
You do like it don't you?

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.120
I want to make you feel good Dae-su.

01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:56.030
<i>You need not worry about the future.</i>

01:04:57.780 --> 01:04:59.200
<i>Imagine nothing.</i>

01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:13.920
<i>I am grateful for</i>
<i>all those years spent in that prison.</i>

01:05:16.510 --> 01:05:20.720
<i>If I was the old Oh Dae-su</i>
<i>would Mido still have liked me?</i>

01:06:57.320 --> 01:07:02.030
<i>He could only have known that I said</i>
<i>I would chop off Mr Park's hand</i>

01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:04.700
<i>by putting a bug on us.</i>

01:07:05.530 --> 01:07:07.700
<i>And he knew</i>
<i>where we were by tailing us.</i>

01:07:08.330 --> 01:07:10.120
I'VE BEEN BUGGED. PLEASE FIND IT.

01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:11.870
<i>You know</i>

01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:14.500
<i>maybe he freed you</i>

01:07:15.210 --> 01:07:18.800
<i>because he has fun watching you</i>
<i>run wild seeking revenge.</i>

01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:24.680
<i>And he'll never tell you why</i>
<i>so he can toy with you forever.</i>

01:07:26.970 --> 01:07:28.140
<i>Is that why?</i>

WELCOME TO EVERGREEN OLD BOYS

THE SANGNOK HIGH SCHOOL
ALUMNI HOMEPAGE.

01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:19.569
<i>I should be locking up now.</i>

01:08:19.899 --> 01:08:23.359
Can I just look at
the records for the class of '79?

01:08:28.779 --> 01:08:30.740
It's dark. Put the lights on.

01:08:35.410 --> 01:08:36.790
Take your time.

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:39.040
LEE WOO-JIN

01:08:40.250 --> 01:08:41.750
Joo-hwan?

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:43.380
Let me ask you something.

01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:46.760
Do you remember
Lee Woo-jin from school?

01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:49.470
I think he went to study in America.

01:08:50.430 --> 01:08:51.470
<i>Lee Woo-jin?</i>

01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:55.770
<i>I don't know him.</i>
<i>So is that the bastard's name?</i>

01:08:56.729 --> 01:08:57.979
<i>How did you find out?</i>

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:01.229
<i>I looked through</i>
<i>all the school yearbooks.</i>

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:04.740
<i>I need more than just a name.</i>

01:09:04.899 --> 01:09:06.359
<i>Got anything else?</i>

01:09:06.529 --> 01:09:09.450
<i>Look at the student records.</i>

01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:12.660
<i>Do you know Lee Soo-ah?</i>
<i>She was in our year.</i>

01:09:12.830 --> 01:09:13.870
<i>Lee Soo-ah?</i>

01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:15.960
<i>She died.</i>

01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:19.420
<i>- What classroom was she in?</i>
<i>- Room two I think.</i>

01:09:19.630 --> 01:09:21.290
<i>She was in my room.</i>

01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:23.960
<i>Next to yours.</i>
<i>So what about her?</i>

01:09:26.170 --> 01:09:27.340
Why is there no photo?

01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:32.970
She died. That must be why.

01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:34.430
How did Lee Soo-ah die?

01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:37.020
<i>Yeah you wouldn't know.</i>

01:09:37.229 --> 01:09:39.649
<i>She died after you moved schools.</i>

01:09:41.149 --> 01:09:46.029
<i>She went to the Habchun Dam alone</i>
<i>and fell into the water.</i>

01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:48.569
<i>She bit the dust.</i>

01:09:51.490 --> 01:09:56.040
<i>One week later they found</i>
<i>her bloated body in the water.</i>

01:09:56.910 --> 01:09:59.330
- What was she like?
- <i>Her?</i>

01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:01.630
She was a total slut.

01:10:01.790 --> 01:10:05.550
On the outside
she acted like a lady

01:10:05.710 --> 01:10:09.260
but inside she was just
a filthy whore.

01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:13.930
The rumor going around school
was that she'd fuck anyone.

01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:17.680
I should have got in there.

01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:24.020
I also heard that her family
was filthy rich.

01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:26.900
Her grades were good too.

01:10:27.070 --> 01:10:31.110
But the worst thing was
that she was a total slut.

01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:34.530
God this is such an old story.

01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:38.200
Dae-su I can't remember
because it was so long ago

01:10:38.370 --> 01:10:40.460
but that Soo-ah well...

01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:57.720
<i>Joo-hwan what is it?</i>

01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:03.270
<i>Joo-hwan is something wrong?</i>

01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:11.860
Oh Dae-su.

01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:14.570
My sister...

01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:17.410
..was no slut.

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:21.330
You must believe that.

01:11:24.290 --> 01:11:28.250
You got rid of your bug so
I had to come all the way here.

01:11:29.170 --> 01:11:31.380
To eavesdrop.

01:11:31.970 --> 01:11:33.840
That's why Joo-hwan is dead...

01:11:35.890 --> 01:11:37.510
..because of you.

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:39.640
OK?

01:11:52.110 --> 01:11:54.160
<i>You bastard I'm coming for you!</i>

01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:59.330
<i>I'm going to kill you!</i>

01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:21.020
You son of a bitch!

01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:45.500
We're not open yet.
Come back in an hour please.

01:12:46.210 --> 01:12:49.670
This place was recommended
by someone with six gold teeth.

01:12:58.470 --> 01:12:59.510
Mr Park?

01:13:01.010 --> 01:13:02.810
I had to move because of you.

01:13:03.930 --> 01:13:05.770
To celebrate the occasion...

01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:09.020
..I installed a new TV.

01:13:09.190 --> 01:13:11.020
Do you like it?

01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:15.700
It's got so many channels.
Great isn't it?

01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:18.280
Some prisoners
don't want to leave at all.

01:13:18.450 --> 01:13:21.740
You lived in a place like this
for 15 years Dae-su?

01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:24.830
After 11 years it felt like home.

01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:29.750
Come on I don't need your money.

01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:32.340
My enemy's enemy is my friend.

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:40.800
We threw away the hand
because it rotted.

01:13:40.970 --> 01:13:42.220
I've missed you.

01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:46.770
Bastard. You'll pay for this.

01:13:50.150 --> 01:13:52.690
So why did you bring me here?

01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:02.660
If I don't return after July 5th
let her go.

01:14:07.250 --> 01:14:11.130
While I was locked up here
I remember someone visiting me.

01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:14.210
What did that person do?

01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:15.920
Was it three times?

01:14:16.090 --> 01:14:20.640
I put a hypnosis-inducing drug
in your water.

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:22.350
Sodium barbiturate?

01:14:23.810 --> 01:14:24.850
He's a genius!

01:14:37.650 --> 01:14:39.110
WATERWHEEL HAIR SALON

01:14:46.870 --> 01:14:48.370
That's rubbish.

01:14:48.540 --> 01:14:50.670
Even though it was a Catholic school

01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:54.130
those rumors wouldn't have
killed her.

01:14:54.290 --> 01:14:56.550
There was probably something else.

01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:01.430
Could she have been pregnant maybe?

01:15:03.090 --> 01:15:07.140
I really don't think
Soo-ah was like that.

01:15:07.350 --> 01:15:10.230
She was such a pure girl.

01:15:10.430 --> 01:15:12.400
I know she never went with anyone.

01:15:13.730 --> 01:15:18.230
But she did go out
with someone back then.

01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:22.530
Do you want to know who he was?

01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:26.030
I haven't got a clue!

01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:40.550
Choon-shim.

01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:45.300
You knew Lee Soo-ah didn't you?
Who was her boyfriend?

01:15:46.890 --> 01:15:47.970
You don't know?

01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:50.560
You silly cow.

01:15:50.730 --> 01:15:52.060
You don't know

01:15:52.270 --> 01:15:54.650
because friendship
means nothing to you.

01:15:54.810 --> 01:15:55.860
Shut up.

01:15:56.310 --> 01:15:57.980
Who would know?

01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:00.400
Who?

01:16:00.570 --> 01:16:01.740
Joo-hwan?

01:16:05.410 --> 01:16:06.990
What?

01:16:08.910 --> 01:16:10.870
Yeah I know him.

01:16:12.330 --> 01:16:13.830
But why would he know?

01:16:15.290 --> 01:16:16.170
Yeah?

01:16:17.170 --> 01:16:18.250
Really?

01:16:19.250 --> 01:16:21.510
OK. I'll call you back in a bit.

01:16:28.050 --> 01:16:29.310
Well...

01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:33.430
She said it was Joo-hwan
who told her the rumors

01:16:34.190 --> 01:16:36.770
and that you should know
more than anyone.

01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:53.540
<i>Ring ring.</i>

01:16:54.410 --> 01:16:55.540
<i>Move aside.</i>

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:00.670
<i>You'll get hurt...</i>

01:17:04.090 --> 01:17:05.510
<i>..if you get in the way.</i>

01:17:16.810 --> 01:17:19.190
OH DAE-SU

01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:36.370
Good Lord!

01:17:36.540 --> 01:17:39.420
You rascal. Put it out!

01:17:39.630 --> 01:17:43.670
I'm leaving today. For Seoul.

01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:47.220
So just you leave me alone missy.

01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:49.590
You good-for-nothing!

01:18:46.730 --> 01:18:48.490
You're Oh Dae-su aren't you?

01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:52.780
And you are...

01:18:52.950 --> 01:18:55.200
I heard
you're popular with the girls.

01:18:56.330 --> 01:18:58.500
You know what rumors are like.

01:18:59.370 --> 01:19:02.500
I heard you're really funny.
Say something.

01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:09.010
It's not good
to be stuck with one image.

01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:21.350
OK there's this father and son.

01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:24.270
They went
to the swimming pool and...

01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:25.570
See you later.

01:19:49.050 --> 01:19:55.390
TAKE CARE FUCKHEADS OF
YEAR 3 CLASS 3.

01:20:51.730 --> 01:20:53.950
- Come on.
- Wait.

01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:58.490
- Come here.
- No.

01:21:01.330 --> 01:21:02.500
Come here.

01:21:02.660 --> 01:21:04.250
OK OK.

01:21:13.090 --> 01:21:14.130
Satisfied?

01:21:15.130 --> 01:21:17.220
- Lift this up.
- No way.

01:21:17.390 --> 01:21:19.050
- Lift it up.
- No.

01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:35.110
What?

01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:45.500
That tickles.

01:22:14.570 --> 01:22:15.940
Give me those.

01:22:21.370 --> 01:22:22.780
What are you doing?

01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:24.120
Let me see.

01:22:24.290 --> 01:22:25.580
What are you doing?

01:22:26.950 --> 01:22:28.710
- Let me see.
- Stop it!

01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:40.680
Go away.

01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:25.110
Was it really Soo-ah? Are you sure?

01:24:25.990 --> 01:24:27.530
I don't know her name.

01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:32.290
I just know that she's in your class
and she rides a red bike.

01:24:40.210 --> 01:24:42.880
Have a good trip.
See you in Seoul.

01:24:43.050 --> 01:24:44.510
Where are you going?

01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:46.720
I've got a date with Choon-shim.

01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:49.720
I'll kill you if you blab to anyone.

01:24:54.980 --> 01:24:56.020
<i>No way.</i>

01:24:57.980 --> 01:25:01.400
<i>You got locked up for 15 years</i>
<i>just for saying that?</i>

01:25:04.110 --> 01:25:05.820
<i>Is that such a crime?</i>

01:25:08.780 --> 01:25:11.450
"Whether it be a grain of sand
or a rock

01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:13.660
in water they both sink alike."

01:25:17.130 --> 01:25:19.210
That's Lee Woo-jin's attitude.

01:25:21.170 --> 01:25:22.590
So

01:25:23.260 --> 01:25:25.220
what's the significance of July 5th?

01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:27.840
That's the day...

01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:32.430
..Lee Soo-ah died.

01:25:38.350 --> 01:25:40.110
It's over now.

01:25:40.770 --> 01:25:42.780
You were fighting for the truth

01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:44.990
not for revenge weren't you?

01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:51.580
Now we'll run away
where Woo-jin can never follow us.

01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:56.910
<i>I can't end it like this.</i>

01:25:57.870 --> 01:26:00.290
Vengeance has become a part of me.

01:26:05.970 --> 01:26:08.680
But you don't even know
where he lives.

01:26:10.220 --> 01:26:13.600
<i>"Like a gazelle</i>
<i>from the hand of the hunter...</i>

01:26:13.810 --> 01:26:17.020
<i>"Like a bird</i>
<i>from the snare of the fowler...</i>

01:26:17.190 --> 01:26:18.270
<i>"Free yourself. "</i>

01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:23.940
<i>It is taken from the Book</i>
<i>of Proverbs chapter six verse four.</i>

01:26:24.150 --> 01:26:25.490
<i>And Evergreen...</i>

01:26:26.570 --> 01:26:28.450
<i>..said he lives in a high tower.</i>

01:26:29.740 --> 01:26:32.070
<i>So six and four...</i>

01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:34.450
<i>..must be floors.</i>

01:26:35.910 --> 01:26:36.950
<i>Fourth floor.</i>

01:26:38.290 --> 01:26:39.670
<i>Sixth floor.</i>

01:26:40.540 --> 01:26:41.960
<i>Or the 64th floor?</i>

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:46.050
<i>P?</i>

01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:48.050
<i>Penthouse!</i>

01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:53.810
<i>Please insert the code.</i>

01:27:00.100 --> 01:27:02.150
What would you like me to pray for?

01:27:05.530 --> 01:27:06.780
<i>Wrong entry.</i>

01:27:07.490 --> 01:27:09.530
<i>Please re-enter.</i>

01:27:14.620 --> 01:27:18.500
<i>Wrong entry. Please re-enter.</i>

01:27:18.660 --> 01:27:19.710
"Dear Lord...

01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:23.380
..please let me...

01:27:24.750 --> 01:27:27.170
..meet a younger man next time."

01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:19.270
Please make Woo-jin...

01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:22.190
..kneel before Dae-su...

01:28:23.900 --> 01:28:26.730
..and beg for forgiveness.

01:28:40.410 --> 01:28:42.040
You slept with your sister.

01:28:53.550 --> 01:28:55.220
Let's go upstairs and talk.

01:29:18.530 --> 01:29:19.620
Get him!

01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:44.730
Just talk.

01:30:15.550 --> 01:30:17.090
That's better.

01:30:19.260 --> 01:30:20.930
You slept with your sister.

01:30:21.100 --> 01:30:22.350
So refreshing.

01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:31.520
And I started the rumors.

01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:34.190
That's why your sister died.

01:30:41.780 --> 01:30:44.620
Looking in the mirror
reminds me of that day.

01:30:45.620 --> 01:30:46.750
How about you?

01:30:46.910 --> 01:30:51.130
Erasing my memory and telling me
to find the truth was cowardly.

01:30:52.590 --> 01:30:53.880
I won...

01:30:56.300 --> 01:30:58.220
..so die like you promised.

01:30:58.420 --> 01:31:01.890
Did you think you'd forgotten
that day because you were hypnotized?

01:31:03.550 --> 01:31:04.430
<i>Really?</i>

01:31:06.100 --> 01:31:09.020
Do you know the real reason
why you can't remember?

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:13.520
It's because...

01:31:17.900 --> 01:31:19.360
..you just forgot.

01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:22.870
Is that not exciting enough for you?

01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:26.080
Well it's true you just forgot.

01:31:26.490 --> 01:31:29.080
Why? Because
it wasn't important to you.

01:31:30.410 --> 01:31:32.170
Your rumor got so out of hand

01:31:32.380 --> 01:31:35.670
that the next rumor
was that Soo-ah was pregnant.

01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:40.300
My sister got sucked into that rumor
and began believing it.

01:31:40.970 --> 01:31:44.640
So her periods stopped
and her belly began to swell.

01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:47.180
Fascinating isn't it?

01:31:47.390 --> 01:31:51.140
Imagine how a girl would feel to
carry both her child and her nephew.

01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:53.100
Do you understand now?

01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:58.190
Your tongue got my sister pregnant.

01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:02.410
It wasn't Lee Woo-jin's dick.

01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:05.530
It was Oh Dae-su's tongue.

01:32:11.370 --> 01:32:13.290
Is that why you killed your sister?

01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:15.380
Imagine how a boy would feel

01:32:15.380 --> 01:32:17.710
fathering both his child
and his nephew?

01:32:22.130 --> 01:32:23.590
You were probably afraid.

01:32:24.180 --> 01:32:27.220
Afraid that everyone would know
once the baby was born.

01:32:28.890 --> 01:32:32.310
After you killed her you realised it
was a phantom pregnancy...

01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:35.230
..so your hating me...

01:32:37.270 --> 01:32:38.440
..is understandable.

01:32:43.950 --> 01:32:46.320
They said Soo-ah died alone
at the dam

01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:48.580
so who took this photo?

01:32:50.410 --> 01:32:52.290
And what about the date July 5th?

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.340
This is no fun.

01:33:03.220 --> 01:33:05.550
I'll just finish what I was saying.

01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:08.890
Listen carefully.
My story is really exciting.

01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:11.640
<i>Ever heard</i>
<i>of post-hypnotic suggestion?</i>

01:33:11.850 --> 01:33:14.100
<i>You suggest something</i>
<i>during hypnosis</i>

01:33:14.270 --> 01:33:16.520
<i>then it's performed</i>
<i>in your wakened state.</i>

01:33:18.820 --> 01:33:20.530
Still haven't worked it out?

01:33:26.660 --> 01:33:29.580
You let a stranger into your home.
Who are you?

01:33:30.410 --> 01:33:32.500
<i>What about you you bastard?</i>

01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:40.500
<i>We hypnotized both of you.</i>

01:33:42.090 --> 01:33:45.220
<i>One fortunate thing was that</i>
<i>compared to others</i>

01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:48.260
<i>both of you</i>
<i>were receptive to hypnosis.</i>

01:33:49.930 --> 01:33:51.220
<i>Isn't this fun?</i>

01:33:51.390 --> 01:33:55.520
<i>One word gets you pregnant.</i>
<i>Another makes you fall in love.</i>

01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:02.780
But no matter how receptive
you two were to hypnosis

01:34:02.940 --> 01:34:06.570
and no matter how good
a hypnotist Miss Yoo is

01:34:06.740 --> 01:34:09.490
getting people
to fall in love isn't easy.

01:34:11.780 --> 01:34:13.200
Do you know how we did it?

01:34:16.750 --> 01:34:19.080
Your first suggestion of course

01:34:19.250 --> 01:34:21.250
was to go to that restaurant

01:34:21.420 --> 01:34:24.010
straight after your release.

01:34:25.170 --> 01:34:28.260
Next to react
to the mobile phone's ringtone.

01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:33.560
When you heard this
you were programmed to say something.

01:34:35.020 --> 01:34:36.060
Who are you?

01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:39.650
Do you

01:34:39.810 --> 01:34:41.270
like your clothes?

01:34:42.730 --> 01:34:45.690
<i>And Mido was programmed</i>
<i>to react to the man</i>

01:34:45.860 --> 01:34:47.450
<i>who would say this.</i>

01:34:47.610 --> 01:34:51.160
<i>When she touched your hand</i>
<i>your reaction would be...</i>

01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:58.290
Your gravest mistake
wasn't failing to find the answer.

01:34:59.420 --> 01:35:01.000
If you keep

01:35:01.210 --> 01:35:05.000
asking the wrong questions
you'll never find the right answer.

01:35:05.170 --> 01:35:09.760
It's not
"Why did Woo-jin imprison me?"

01:35:10.180 --> 01:35:12.930
It's "Why did he release me?"

01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:14.970
Once again...

01:35:16.020 --> 01:35:20.100
..why did Woo-jin
release Dae-su after...

01:35:21.770 --> 01:35:23.770
..15 years?

01:37:25.310 --> 01:37:28.610
LAUGH AND THE WORLD LAUGHS
WITH YOU. WEEP AND YOU WEEP
ALONE.

01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:11.040
<i>Mr Han.</i>

01:39:19.970 --> 01:39:21.470
<i>Mr Han!</i>

01:40:02.140 --> 01:40:03.390
Mido...

01:40:10.230 --> 01:40:11.600
Mido doesn't know?

01:40:16.940 --> 01:40:18.990
Why did you hide her there?

01:40:20.990 --> 01:40:24.240
Did you think he'd hate me
just because I cut off his hand?

01:40:24.620 --> 01:40:26.780
Didn't you work out
that it was a trap?

01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:32.370
How can you protect your woman
with that brain?

01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:37.710
I've secretly been raising Mido
since she was three.

01:40:39.130 --> 01:40:41.130
What's wrong with you?

01:40:42.260 --> 01:40:43.890
Mr Park's hand?

01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:46.970
You moron.

01:40:48.140 --> 01:40:52.480
Did you see his new prison? I gave
him that building for his hand!

01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:53.850
Me!

01:41:18.630 --> 01:41:19.840
Dae-su!

01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:23.720
In front of me

01:41:23.930 --> 01:41:26.010
there's some kind of box.

01:41:26.180 --> 01:41:28.010
He's telling me to open it.

01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:30.390
It's the same violet box...

01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:31.560
No!

01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:34.730
No Mido don't.

01:41:34.890 --> 01:41:37.310
Don't open it no matter what.

01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:39.730
Or something terrible will happen.

01:41:39.940 --> 01:41:43.070
What's in it?
You know don't you?

01:41:43.610 --> 01:41:46.070
Mido just wait a little longer.

01:41:46.860 --> 01:41:48.620
Dae-su will be there soon.

01:41:48.780 --> 01:41:51.790
I'll be there very soon.

01:41:53.830 --> 01:41:56.040
Can't you come now?

01:41:58.460 --> 01:41:59.670
I'm scared.

01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:01.840
Little Mido you can wait can't you?

01:42:02.050 --> 01:42:03.170
Yes.

01:42:04.090 --> 01:42:06.380
Very good. Good girl.

01:42:07.510 --> 01:42:11.140
I'll call you back very soon OK?

01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:27.410
Please.

01:42:30.830 --> 01:42:32.540
Don't tell Mido.

01:42:37.290 --> 01:42:38.960
What has she done wrong?

01:42:41.500 --> 01:42:43.050
You know it was all my fault.

01:42:47.180 --> 01:42:48.550
I have...

01:42:50.140 --> 01:42:52.310
..committed an unforgivable sin...

01:42:53.310 --> 01:42:55.100
..against your sister.

01:42:56.980 --> 01:42:59.060
And I also...

01:43:00.610 --> 01:43:01.980
..did you wrong.

01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:04.570
But...

01:43:06.490 --> 01:43:08.570
..please leave Mido alone.

01:43:14.410 --> 01:43:15.450
If by any chance...

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
..Mido finds out the truth

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
you son of a bitch

01:43:22.630 --> 01:43:26.260
I'll tear you limb from limb.

01:43:27.470 --> 01:43:31.550
And your remains will never be found.

01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:33.100
Why?

01:43:33.260 --> 01:43:35.930
Because I'm going
to swallow every last bit.

01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:39.600
Woo-jin!

01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:43.020
Please sir I made a mistake.

01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:46.650
Please forget what I said.

01:43:46.820 --> 01:43:49.150
Sir! Woo-jin!

01:43:50.110 --> 01:43:54.200
We're Evergreen Old Boys remember?

01:43:55.240 --> 01:44:01.290
<i>With the energy</i>
<i>of a green pine tree</i>

01:44:04.460 --> 01:44:08.050
<i>The Great Sangnok High...</i>

01:44:11.590 --> 01:44:14.760
I'll do whatever you want.

01:44:14.970 --> 01:44:17.100
I'll do anything. I beg you.

01:44:17.770 --> 01:44:22.940
Woo-jin if you want me
to be your dog I will!

01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:27.020
From this moment on
I am Woo-jin's dog!

01:44:27.190 --> 01:44:28.230
I'm your bitch.

01:44:34.870 --> 01:44:37.030
Look I'm wagging my tail.

01:44:37.660 --> 01:44:40.580
I'm a dog. I'll guard your house.

01:44:40.750 --> 01:44:43.370
I'll be your slave.

01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:52.500
The box...

01:46:58.260 --> 01:46:59.680
..just leave it closed.

01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:11.610
Now...

01:47:14.730 --> 01:47:17.030
..what will I live for?

01:48:19.510 --> 01:48:20.680
<i>Dae-su.</i>

01:48:21.470 --> 01:48:23.140
<i>It hurts so much.</i>

01:48:23.930 --> 01:48:25.760
<i>But I'll endure it.</i>

01:48:26.850 --> 01:48:28.220
<i>You must understand.</i>

01:48:52.420 --> 01:48:55.710
My sister and I loved each other
despite everything.

01:49:00.210 --> 01:49:01.880
Can you two do the same?

01:49:45.380 --> 01:49:46.220
Soo-ah.

01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:03.440
Woo-jin.

01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:07.320
I know you've always been afraid.

01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:12.910
So just let go of me.

01:50:29.970 --> 01:50:32.850
Please remember me.

01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:44.070
I have no regrets. Do you?

01:51:29.610 --> 01:51:33.450
<i>This is the whole adventure</i>
<i>of my life until now.</i>

01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:37.160
<i>Thank you for listening</i>
<i>to this terrible story to the end.</i>

01:51:37.870 --> 01:51:42.290
<i>I trust that you will understand</i>
<i>my sending a letter</i>

01:51:42.460 --> 01:51:46.090
<i>instead of talking to you in person.</i>

01:51:46.260 --> 01:51:48.170
<i>This is because</i>
<i>I have no tongue.</i>

01:51:48.340 --> 01:51:51.010
To be honest
there's no reason I should help you.

01:51:56.890 --> 01:51:58.270
But there was one thing.

01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:01.770
I was touched by this last sentence.

01:52:03.820 --> 01:52:09.450
EVEN THOUGH
I'M NO BETTER THAN A BEAST

01:52:09.610 --> 01:52:13.120
DON'T I HAVE THE RIGHT TO LIVE?

01:52:16.040 --> 01:52:19.040
The hypnosis may go wrong
and distort your memories.

01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:22.250
Do you want to proceed?

01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:45.310
If you're ready...

01:52:47.150 --> 01:52:49.150
..look at that tree.

01:53:06.130 --> 01:53:07.380
The tree...

01:53:08.420 --> 01:53:11.470
..is slowly changing
into a concrete pillar.

01:53:20.100 --> 01:53:24.020
You're now
inside Lee Woo-jin's penthouse.

01:53:25.150 --> 01:53:26.810
<i>It's a dreary night.</i>

01:53:30.110 --> 01:53:32.900
<i>The sound of your footsteps</i>
<i>crossing to the window</i>

01:53:33.070 --> 01:53:34.910
<i>fills the room.</i>

01:53:49.050 --> 01:53:52.590
<i>When I ring my bell...</i>

01:53:54.050 --> 01:53:56.930
<i>..you'll split into two people.</i>

01:54:01.060 --> 01:54:04.440
<i>One person doesn't know</i>
<i>your secret.: Oh Dae-su.</i>

01:54:05.690 --> 01:54:08.520
<i>The one who knows your secret</i>
<i>is the monster.</i>

01:54:09.980 --> 01:54:12.280
<i>When I ring the bell again</i>

01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:15.530
<i>the monster will turn around</i>
<i>and start walking.</i>

01:54:20.370 --> 01:54:26.170
<i>With each step</i>
<i>he will age by one year.</i>

01:54:26.370 --> 01:54:29.250
<i>When he reaches 70</i>
<i>the monster will die.</i>

01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:31.340
<i>There's no need to worry.</i>

01:54:32.340 --> 01:54:35.050
<i>It will be a very peaceful death.</i>

01:54:42.720 --> 01:54:44.230
<i>Now good luck to you.</i>

01:55:26.890 --> 01:55:28.940
What's going on?

01:55:29.900 --> 01:55:31.940
Look at you.

01:56:01.090 --> 01:56:02.720
Who were you with?

01:56:58.650 --> 01:57:00.150
I love you...

01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:02.530
..Dae-su..
