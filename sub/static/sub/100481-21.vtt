WEBVTT

00:24.467 --> 00:26.800
>> John: HI THERE!

00:26.867 --> 00:28.300
WELCOME TO THE SHOW, STILL

00:28.367 --> 00:29.734
TAKING PLACE IN THIS BLANK VOID

00:29.800 --> 00:31.133
THAT HAS ALL THE DESIGN

00:31.200 --> 00:32.467
AESTHETICS OF HEAVEN WITH ALL

00:32.533 --> 00:33.867
THE DEPRESSING VIBES OF HELL.

00:33.934 --> 00:35.200
IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK, FROM

00:35.266 --> 00:36.500
TRUMP ADMITTING TO SABOTAGING

00:36.567 --> 00:37.767
THE U.S. POSTAL SERVICE TO MAKE

00:37.834 --> 00:39.367
MAIL-IN VOTING MORE DIFFICULT TO

00:39.433 --> 00:40.066
HERMAN CAIN SOMEHOW TWEETING

00:40.133 --> 00:41.734
FROM THE DEAD.

00:41.800 --> 00:42.800
BUT THE BIG NEWS WAS

00:42.867 --> 00:43.867
KAMALA HARRIS BEING ANNOUNCED AS

00:43.934 --> 00:45.567
BIDEN'S RUNNING MATE, A DECISION

00:45.633 --> 00:46.967
THAT SENT CONSERVATIVES

00:47.033 --> 00:48.166
SCRAMBLING FOR ATTACK

00:48.233 --> 00:49.934
STRATEGIES, FROM CLAIMING IT'S

00:50.000 --> 00:52.333
AN EXTREME, FAR-LEFT TICKET --

00:52.400 --> 00:54.233
WHICH IT ABSOLUTELY ISN'T -- TO

00:54.300 --> 00:55.233
A BASELESS ACCUSATION THAT SHE

00:55.300 --> 00:59.433
MAY NOT MEET THE CITIZENSHIP

00:59.500 --> 01:00.667
REQUIREMENTS TO HOLD THE OFFICE,

01:00.734 --> 01:01.300
DESPITE BEING VERY MUCH BORN IN

01:01.367 --> 01:02.300
THE UNITED STATES.

01:02.367 --> 01:03.867
IT'S A DEPRESSING RESURGENCE OF

01:03.934 --> 01:04.767
BIRTHERISM, SO OF COURSE TRUMP

01:04.834 --> 01:08.500
JUMPED ALL OVER IT.

01:08.567 --> 01:10.567
>> I HEARD IT TODAY THAT

01:10.633 --> 01:12.333
SHE DOESN'T MEET THE

01:12.400 --> 01:13.667
REQUIREMENTS AND, BY THE WAY,

01:13.734 --> 01:15.567
THE LAWYER THAT WROTE THAT PIECE

01:15.633 --> 01:16.867
IS A VERY HIGHLY QUALIFIED, VERY

01:16.934 --> 01:18.367
TALENTED LAWYER.

01:18.433 --> 01:24.867
I HAVE NO IDEA IF THAT'S RIGHT.

01:24.934 --> 01:25.633
>> John: OH, I'LL TELL YOU IF

01:25.700 --> 01:26.166
IT'S RIGHT.

01:26.233 --> 01:26.734
IT FUCKING ISN'T.

01:26.800 --> 01:27.700
IT'S AMAZING HOW SLOW TRUMP IS

01:27.767 --> 01:28.633
TO RESPOND TO MANY THINGS, LIKE,

01:28.700 --> 01:29.700
I DUNNO, PUBLIC HEALTH CRISES,

01:29.767 --> 01:34.033
YET WHEN IT COMES TO AMPLIFYING

01:34.100 --> 01:35.734
RACIST CONSPIRACY THEORIES

01:35.800 --> 01:36.633
SUDDENLY HE'S THE FUCKING FLASH

01:36.700 --> 01:37.200
ON COCAINE.

01:37.266 --> 01:38.233
AND SADLY, IT WASN'T EVEN THE

01:38.300 --> 01:38.800
ONLY CONSPIRACY THEORY THAT

01:38.867 --> 01:39.734
STAINED THIS WEEK, AS TUESDAY

01:39.800 --> 01:40.500
SAW A STUNNING RESULT IN A

01:40.567 --> 01:41.767
CONGRESSIONAL PRIMARY.

01:41.834 --> 01:42.900
>> BUSINESSWOMAN MARJORIE

01:42.967 --> 01:44.433
TAYLOR GREENE IS NOW THE HEAVY

01:44.500 --> 01:45.900
FAVORITE TO WIN A SEAT

01:45.967 --> 01:47.633
REPRESENTING A DEEPLY

01:47.700 --> 01:48.834
CONSERVATIVE DISTRICT IN

01:48.900 --> 01:50.300
NORTHWEST GEORGIA.

01:50.367 --> 01:51.734
GREENE HAS REPEATEDLY PRAISED

01:51.800 --> 01:52.800
THE QANON THEORY.

01:52.867 --> 01:54.133
>> Q IS A PATRIOT.

01:54.200 --> 01:56.667
WE KNOW THAT FOR SURE.

01:56.734 --> 01:59.066
BUT WE DO NOT KNOW WHO Q IS.

01:59.133 --> 02:01.200
PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT Q IS SOMEONE

02:01.266 --> 02:03.367
VERY CLOSE TO PRESIDENT TRUMP.

02:03.433 --> 02:05.233
>> John: OH, GREAT.

02:05.300 --> 02:06.433
JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT 2020

02:06.500 --> 02:07.800
COULDN'T GET ANY WORSE, WHAT

02:07.867 --> 02:09.133
WITH THE PANDEMIC AND

02:09.200 --> 02:10.433
MURDER HORNETS, NOW SOMEONE

02:10.500 --> 02:11.600
WHO'S OPENLY ENDORSED A

02:11.667 --> 02:12.834
CONSPIRACY THEORY HAS WON A

02:12.900 --> 02:14.767
CONGRESSIONAL PRIMARY.

02:14.834 --> 02:15.500
AND THAT IS ALARMING.

02:15.567 --> 02:16.900
WHEN YOUR DRUNK AUNT IS FOUR

02:16.967 --> 02:17.767
WINE AND TONICS DEEP, THRASHING

02:17.834 --> 02:18.400
HER PASHMINA AROUND THE

02:18.467 --> 02:19.333
THANKSGIVING TABLE SCREAMING

02:19.400 --> 02:20.533
"JET FUEL CAN'T MELT STEEL

02:20.600 --> 02:22.567
BEAMS," YOU'RE DEFINITELY NOT

02:22.633 --> 02:23.500
THINKING, "I WISH THE FATE OF

02:23.567 --> 02:24.867
THE STIMULUS PACKAGE COULD BE IN

02:24.934 --> 02:26.467
HER HANDS."

02:26.533 --> 02:27.967
AND IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH

02:28.033 --> 02:32.700
TO NOT KNOW WHAT QANON IS AND

02:32.767 --> 02:35.300
YOU'RE THINKING, "LET ME GOOGLE

02:35.367 --> 02:35.767
THAT" -- PLEASE DON'T.

02:35.834 --> 02:36.800
BECAUSE MUCH LIKE "JOE ROGAN NET

02:36.867 --> 02:37.433
WORTH," OR "JOHN OLIVER HENTAI,"

02:37.500 --> 02:38.333
GOOGLING QANON IS GOING TO GET

02:38.400 --> 02:39.767
YOU SOME VERY UPSETTING RESULTS.

02:39.834 --> 02:41.767
THE CONSPIRACY INVOLVES A RANGE

02:41.834 --> 02:43.100
OF BATSHIT THEORIES, BUT VERY

02:43.166 --> 02:44.700
BASICALLY, MANY QANON SUPPORTERS

02:44.767 --> 02:46.967
BELIEVE IN "A GLOBAL CONSPIRACY

02:47.033 --> 02:47.767
INVOLVING A RING OF

02:47.834 --> 02:49.500
SATAN-WORSHIPING,

02:49.567 --> 02:50.834
CHILD-MOLESTING CRIMINALS LED BY

02:50.900 --> 02:52.100
PROMINENT DEMOCRATS" THAT

02:52.166 --> 02:53.200
INCLUDES EVERYONE FROM

02:53.266 --> 02:54.633
HILLARY CLINTON TO TOM HANKS TO

02:54.700 --> 02:56.133
A MEXICAN CEMENT COMPANY.

02:56.200 --> 02:57.600
THEY ALSO BELIEVE INFORMATION

02:57.667 --> 02:59.233
ABOUT IT IS BEING LEAKED VIA

02:59.300 --> 03:01.100
CRYPTIC POSTS ON THE INTERNET BY

03:01.166 --> 03:02.867
SOMEONE WITH VERY HIGH "Q"-LEVEL

03:02.934 --> 03:04.300
SECURITY CLEARANCE, WHICH SOUNDS

03:04.367 --> 03:07.233
JUST AS MADE UP AS IT IS, AND

03:07.300 --> 03:08.333
APPARENTLY, THE MAIN PERSON

03:08.400 --> 03:10.300
WHO'S WORKING TO ROOT OUT

03:10.367 --> 03:11.600
THE SATANIST PEDOPHILES IS

03:11.667 --> 03:12.834
DONALD TRUMP, WHICH IS A LITTLE

03:12.867 --> 03:14.333
WEIRD, BECAUSE...

03:14.400 --> 03:16.300
Y'KNOW.

03:16.367 --> 03:17.533
THE POINT IS, NO MATTER HOW MUCH

03:17.600 --> 03:19.567
THE THEORY EVOLVES, ONE THING'S

03:19.633 --> 03:20.734
ALWAYS THE SAME:

03:20.800 --> 03:22.400
>> THE BOTTOM LINE ABOUT THIS

03:22.467 --> 03:23.400
CONSPIRACY THEORY IS THAT IT'S A

03:23.467 --> 03:25.033
CONSPIRACY TO PROTECT TRUMP.

03:25.100 --> 03:26.166
SO THINGS THAT, TO THE REST OF

03:26.233 --> 03:27.633
US, MIGHT SEEM LIKE BAD NEWS FOR

03:27.700 --> 03:28.600
TRUMP, LIKE THE MUELLER

03:28.667 --> 03:29.900
INVESTIGATION, THEY LOOK AT AS

03:29.967 --> 03:31.200
ACTUALLY PART OF TRUMP'S GRAND

03:31.266 --> 03:33.233
STRATEGY.

03:33.300 --> 03:34.333
YOU SEE, HE WAS COLLUDING WITH

03:34.400 --> 03:35.767
RU -- HE WANTED TO MAKE IT LOOK

03:35.834 --> 03:36.467
LIKE HE WAS COLLUDING WITH

03:36.533 --> 03:37.367
RUSSIA ON PURPOSE SO THAT ROBERT

03:37.433 --> 03:38.433
MUELLER WOULD BE HIRED AND HE

03:38.500 --> 03:39.834
COULD TEAM UP WITH TRUMP,

03:39.900 --> 03:41.200
MUELLER AND TRUMP TEAMING UP

03:41.266 --> 03:42.667
TOGETHER TO INVESTIGATE THE

03:42.734 --> 03:43.567
CLINTONS AND THE REST OF THE

03:43.633 --> 03:45.400
DEEP STATE AND THEIR GLOBAL

03:45.467 --> 03:49.734
PEDOPHILE SEX RING.

03:49.800 --> 03:51.533
>> SO THAT IS -- THAT TAKES

03:51.600 --> 03:52.567
A LOT OF...

03:52.633 --> 03:56.433
THINKING TO GET THAT FAR.

03:56.500 --> 03:57.400
>> John: YEAH, IT DOES.

03:57.467 --> 03:58.567
AND MY FAVORITE PART OF

03:58.633 --> 03:59.200
THAT IS WATCHING JUDY WOODRUFF

03:59.266 --> 03:59.767
STRUGGLE TO FIND A WORD TO

03:59.834 --> 04:00.400
DESCRIBE IT THAT SHE CAN SAY ON

04:00.467 --> 04:00.800
PBS.

04:00.867 --> 04:01.767
BECAUSE "THAT TAKES A LOT OF

04:01.834 --> 04:03.000
THINKING" IS BASICALLY PUBLIC

04:03.066 --> 04:03.667
TELEVISION FOR "THAT'S THE

04:03.734 --> 04:07.200
DUMBEST SHIT I'VE EVER HEARD."

04:07.266 --> 04:08.200
NOW, TO GIVE YOU A TASTE OF HOW

04:08.266 --> 04:09.667
INTRICATELY STUPID THIS IS, THIS

04:09.734 --> 04:10.567
FLOW CHART PURPORTS TO EXPLAIN

04:10.633 --> 04:12.133
HOW Q'S THEORIES RELATE TO

04:12.200 --> 04:13.667
EVERYTHING ELSE, CONNECTING Q TO

04:13.734 --> 04:15.333
EVERYTHING FROM HALLIBURTON TO

04:15.400 --> 04:16.700
"JESUIT REVENGE" TO SIMPLY

04:16.767 --> 04:18.934
"WIFI, 1998."

04:19.000 --> 04:20.433
ALTHOUGH I DO THINK WE CAN ALL

04:20.500 --> 04:22.300
AGREE THAT PRINCESS DIANA IS

04:22.367 --> 04:23.567
INDEED THE CONNECTIVE TISSUE

04:23.633 --> 04:24.767
BETWEEN JonBENET RAMSEY AND

04:24.867 --> 04:27.100
LOCKHEED MARTIN.

04:27.166 --> 04:28.834
AND THERE'S SO MUCH MORE, LIKE

04:28.900 --> 04:30.100
THE QANON SLOGAN, "WHERE WE GO

04:30.166 --> 04:32.600
ONE, WE GO ALL," HELPFULLY

04:32.667 --> 04:34.000
ABBREVIATED AS WWG1WGA IN CASE

04:34.066 --> 04:35.467
YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE A

04:35.533 --> 04:40.333
HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE MISTAKE.

04:40.400 --> 04:41.700
ALSO THERE ARE QANON SONGS, AND

04:41.767 --> 04:42.300
BRACE YOURSELF -- EVERYTHING

04:42.367 --> 04:43.300
YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE IS TOTAL

THERE?

05:18.667 --> 05:20.000
ALSO, TO THE COMMENTER WHO WROTE

ON THE QANON VIDEO, "WOW!

05:22.200 --> 05:23.667
I DON'T CARE FOR HIP-HOP BUT I

05:23.734 --> 05:26.367
LOVE THIS!"

05:26.433 --> 05:27.900
I'VE GOT SOME GOOD NEWS, IF YOU

05:27.967 --> 05:29.367
LIKE THAT VIDEO, YOU STILL DON'T

05:29.433 --> 05:29.734
LIKE HIP-HOP.

05:29.800 --> 05:30.800
AND GREENE BOOSTING QANON SHOULD

05:30.867 --> 05:31.500
BE DISQUALIFYING IN ITSELF --

05:31.567 --> 05:33.533
CONSPIRACY THEORIES CAN BE

05:33.600 --> 05:34.100
INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS.

05:34.166 --> 05:35.066
BUT IT'S ALSO FAR FROM THE ONLY

05:35.133 --> 05:36.266
ODIOUS THING SHE'S EVER SAID.

05:36.333 --> 05:38.033
>> GREENE ALSO WON DESPITE A

05:38.100 --> 05:40.633
HISTORY OF RACIST AND INCENDIARY

05:40.700 --> 05:42.033
REMARKS AGAINST MUSLIMS.

05:42.100 --> 05:44.066
>> WE HAVE AN ISLAMIC INVASION

05:44.133 --> 05:50.000
INTO OUR GOVERNMENT OFFICES.

05:50.066 --> 05:52.767
>> ABOUT DEMOCRATS.

05:52.834 --> 05:53.767
>> THEY'RE TRYING TO KEEP THE

05:53.834 --> 05:54.533
BLACK PEOPLE IN A MODERN-DAY

05:54.600 --> 05:55.033
FORUM OF SLAVERY.

05:55.100 --> 05:55.967
IT'S A SLAVERY SYSTEM TO KEEP

05:56.033 --> 05:56.834
THEIR VOTE.

05:56.900 --> 05:57.867
>> ABOUT BLACKS AND CONFEDERATE

05:57.934 --> 05:58.300
STATUES.

05:58.367 --> 05:59.667
>> IF I WERE BLACK PEOPLE TODAY

05:59.734 --> 06:01.066
AND I WALKED BY ONE OF THOSE

06:01.133 --> 06:02.300
STATUES, I WOULD BE SO PROUD,

06:02.367 --> 06:03.400
BECAUSE I'D SAY, "LOOK HOW FAR I

06:03.467 --> 06:05.400
HAVE COME IN THIS COUNTRY."

06:05.467 --> 06:09.867
>> John: OKAY, FIRST OF ALL, IF

06:09.934 --> 06:10.800
YOU WERE "BLACK PEOPLE TODAY"?

06:10.867 --> 06:11.500
SO, NOT JUST ONE BLACK PERSON,

06:11.567 --> 06:12.266
BUT "ALL" BLACK PEOPLE?

06:12.333 --> 06:13.166
ALSO, WHY WOULD ANYONE NEED YOU

06:13.233 --> 06:15.500
TO ENGAGE IN THIS HYPOTHETICAL?

06:15.567 --> 06:16.767
YOU'RE NOT "BLACK PEOPLE" --

06:16.834 --> 06:17.834
THOUGH I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED

06:17.900 --> 06:19.033
TO FIND OUT YOU TEMPORARILY WERE

06:19.133 --> 06:20.367
ON A HALLOWEEN OR TWO.

06:20.433 --> 06:22.700
NOW, I SHOULD SAY THAT, BEFORE

06:22.767 --> 06:23.533
GREENE'S ELECTION, TOP

06:23.600 --> 06:25.333
REPUBLICANS TRIED TO DISTANCE

06:25.400 --> 06:26.700
THEMSELVES FROM HER, WITH HOUSE

06:26.767 --> 06:27.500
MINORITY LEADER KEVIN McCARTHY'S

06:27.567 --> 06:28.667
SPOKESPERSON CALLING HER REMARKS

06:28.734 --> 06:30.166
"APPALLING."

06:30.233 --> 06:31.400
BUT SINCE HER VICTORY, THAT TONE

06:31.467 --> 06:32.633
HAS SHIFTED.

06:32.700 --> 06:34.633
>> PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WAS

06:34.700 --> 06:35.567
QUICK TO HERALD HER VICTORY,

06:35.633 --> 06:37.133
SAYING IN A TWEET WEDNESDAY

06:37.200 --> 06:38.467
MORNING THAT SHE'S A FUTURE

06:38.533 --> 06:39.934
REPUBLICAN STAR AND A REAL

06:40.000 --> 06:41.066
WINNER.

06:41.133 --> 06:42.600
A COUPLE HOURS LATER, A

06:42.667 --> 06:43.834
McCARTHY SPOKESPERSON SAID, "WE

06:43.900 --> 06:45.033
LOOK FORWARD TO GREENE AND OTHER

06:45.100 --> 06:46.467
REPUBLICANS WINNING IN

06:46.533 --> 06:48.734
NOVEMBER."

06:48.800 --> 06:49.900
>> John: OKAY, I GET THAT YOU

06:49.967 --> 06:50.934
SHOULD BE WELCOMING TO YOUR NEW

06:51.000 --> 06:51.667
COLLEAGUES.

06:51.734 --> 06:52.900
BUT MAYBE DON'T BE "THAT"

06:52.967 --> 06:54.033
WELCOMING WHEN THEY'VE BASICALLY

06:54.100 --> 06:55.133
ACCUSED YOUR OTHER CO-WORKERS OF

06:55.200 --> 06:56.000
BEING SATANIC CHILD SEX RING

06:56.066 --> 06:57.100
LEADERS.

06:57.166 --> 06:59.367
SAVE THAT FOR HAPPY HOUR.

06:59.433 --> 07:00.667
THAT'S GOOD GOSSIP.

07:00.734 --> 07:01.934
BUT THIS SHOULD BE WORRYING.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.166
IT'S BAD ENOUGH TO ENCOUNTER

07:03.233 --> 07:06.900
THESE CONSPIRACY THEORIES

07:06.967 --> 07:07.533
ONLINE; IT IS WORSE TO

07:07.600 --> 07:08.500
POTENTIALLY BE ENCOUNTERING THEM

07:08.567 --> 07:11.066
IN THE HALLS OF CONGRESS.

07:11.133 --> 07:12.200
AND I WOULD LOVE TO BE SHOCKED

07:12.266 --> 07:12.867
THAT REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP IS

07:12.934 --> 07:13.600
EMBRACING AN ONLINE TROLL WITH A

07:13.667 --> 07:14.633
HISTORY OF RACIST COMMENTS, BUT

07:14.700 --> 07:15.367
THE TRUTH IS, THEY'VE BEEN DOING

07:15.433 --> 07:18.200
THAT FOR YEARS.

07:18.266 --> 07:19.200
BECAUSE YOU CAN ONLY SEE GREENE

07:19.266 --> 07:21.300
AS A DISTURBING ANOMALY IF YOU

07:21.367 --> 07:23.233
IGNORE THE BASIC FACT THAT, WHEN

07:23.266 --> 07:24.333
IT COMES TO THE MODERN

07:24.400 --> 07:25.567
REPUBLICAN PARTY, WHERE THEY GO

07:25.633 --> 07:32.400
ONE, THEY GO ALL.

07:32.467 --> 07:34.667
>> Announcer: AND NOW,

07:34.734 --> 07:36.600
LARRY KING, MASTER SALESMAN.

07:36.667 --> 07:38.867
>> AS YOU KNOW, I WOULD RARELY

07:38.934 --> 07:40.500
BECOME ASSOCIATED WITH ANY

07:40.567 --> 07:42.467
PRODUCT, AS I HAVE BUILT A

07:42.533 --> 07:43.900
LIFETIME CAREER AS BEING AN

07:43.967 --> 07:44.867
INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIVE

07:44.934 --> 07:45.533
NEWS ANCHOR.

07:45.600 --> 07:49.100
>> I HAVE NEVER IN 60 YEARS ON

07:49.166 --> 07:49.900
THE AIR --

07:49.967 --> 07:50.300
>> REALLY?

07:50.367 --> 07:52.934
>> I'VE NEVER PUT MY NAME ON A

07:53.000 --> 07:57.266
PRODUCT UNTIL SLEEP LIKE A KING.

07:57.333 --> 08:00.333
OMEGA XL.

08:00.400 --> 08:01.767
CALL AND GET MILLIONAIRE SUCCESS

08:01.834 --> 08:02.000
HABITS.

08:02.066 --> 08:04.500
WORKS FOR ME, IT WILL WORK FOR

08:04.567 --> 08:04.667
YOU.

08:04.734 --> 08:06.834
>> TWO OR THREE PAYMENTS.

08:06.900 --> 08:13.667
>> HERE COMES LARRY.

08:13.734 --> 08:16.300
>> I JUST SWALLOW THEM WITHOUT

08:16.367 --> 08:16.500
WATER.

08:16.567 --> 08:18.100
>> EVERYBODY SHOULD BE USING

08:18.166 --> 08:20.367
BREATH GEMS.

08:20.433 --> 08:22.567
>> MY ROMANTIC LIFE.

08:22.633 --> 08:25.567
LET'S JUST SAY, THE KING IS BACK

08:25.633 --> 08:25.767
BACK.

08:25.834 --> 08:26.500
>> John: MOVING ON.

08:26.567 --> 08:27.233
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

08:27.300 --> 08:27.900
JURY DUTY, A SUMMONS FOR WHICH

08:27.967 --> 08:28.967
IS ONE OF THE THINGS YOU LEAST

08:29.033 --> 08:29.600
WANT TO FIND IN THE MAIL, ASIDE

08:29.667 --> 08:30.166
FROM MAYBE A BILL OR A HUMAN

08:30.233 --> 08:31.000
TOE.

08:31.066 --> 08:31.734
PLEASE -- A PINKIE?

08:31.800 --> 08:33.266
CALL ME WHEN YOU'RE SERIOUS

08:33.333 --> 08:36.500
ENOUGH TO SEND A MIDDLE PIGGIE.

08:36.567 --> 08:37.300
THEN MAYBE WE'LL TALK BUSINESS.

08:37.367 --> 08:38.033
COMPLAINING ABOUT JURY DUTY HAS

08:38.100 --> 08:39.000
LONG BEEN A BELOVED AMERICAN

08:39.066 --> 08:39.767
PASTIME.

08:39.834 --> 08:41.633
JUST WATCH THIS CALLER TO A

08:41.700 --> 08:42.433
'90s LOCAL TV SHOW DELIGHT THE

08:42.500 --> 08:43.800
HOST WITH HIS WHINING.

08:43.867 --> 08:45.400
>> THEY PUT US DOWN IN THIS

08:45.467 --> 08:47.834
HOLDING PEN, THEY CALL IT THE

08:47.900 --> 08:50.467
JURY ASSEMBLY ROOM.

08:50.533 --> 08:51.834
>> YEAH?

08:51.900 --> 08:53.166
>> THE J-A-R, THE JAR, THEY

08:53.233 --> 08:54.333
STICK YOU IN THIS JAR, WITH,

08:54.400 --> 08:54.900
LIKE, 300 OTHER PEOPLE FOR A

08:54.967 --> 08:56.066
WHOLE WEEK.

08:56.133 --> 08:56.867
>> OH, MAN.

08:56.934 --> 08:58.100
>> AND I FIGURE IT'S LIKE BEING

08:58.166 --> 08:58.734
IN JAIL, ONLY JAIL'S A WHOLE LOT

08:58.800 --> 08:59.967
BETTER, BECAUSE JAIL'S A LOT

09:00.033 --> 09:00.900
CLEANER AND HAS MUCH BETTER

09:00.967 --> 09:04.100
LIGHTING.

09:04.166 --> 09:04.834
>> OH.

09:04.900 --> 09:05.834
>> AND WE HAVE TO PAY FOR OUR

09:05.900 --> 09:06.567
OWN FOOD, AND WE DON'T GET TO GO

09:06.633 --> 09:07.800
OUTSIDE, WE DON'T GET FREE HBO,

09:07.867 --> 09:08.967
WE DON'T GET TO TALK AS MUCH, WE

09:09.033 --> 09:09.633
DON'T GET HEALTHCARE, AND WE

09:09.700 --> 09:10.367
DON'T GET CONJUGAL VISITS.

09:10.433 --> 09:11.300
>> YOU DON'T GET ANY OF THAT

09:11.367 --> 09:11.934
STUFF?

09:12.000 --> 09:16.200
>> WE DON'T GET ANY OF THAT.

09:16.266 --> 09:16.767
>> John: NOW, HE'S ACTUALLY

09:16.834 --> 09:17.066
RIGHT.

09:17.133 --> 09:17.867
YOU DON'T GET CONJUGAL VISITS

09:17.934 --> 09:18.467
WHILE WAITING TO BE CALLED AT

09:18.533 --> 09:19.266
JURY DUTY.

09:19.333 --> 09:20.066
ALTHOUGH JUDGING FROM THAT CALL,

09:20.133 --> 09:21.100
"BEING AT JURY DUTY" ISN'T THAT

09:21.166 --> 09:22.133
CALLER'S PRIMARY OBSTACLE IN

09:22.200 --> 09:23.033
THAT DEPARTMENT.

09:23.100 --> 09:24.033
AS FOR NOT GETTING HBO, I DON'T

09:24.100 --> 09:27.533
KNOW WHAT HE'S COMPLAINING

09:27.600 --> 09:28.000
ABOUT THERE.

09:28.066 --> 09:28.900
THEY DON'T EVEN GIVE ME FREE HBO

09:28.967 --> 09:30.100
AND I'M ACTIVELY RUINING IT.

09:30.166 --> 09:31.333
NOW, THAT MAN, GREG, WAS A

09:31.400 --> 09:33.000
REGULAR CALLER TO THAT SHOW.

09:33.066 --> 09:34.233
AND I KNOW THAT BECAUSE WE GOT

09:34.300 --> 09:35.166
CURIOUS ABOUT HIM AFTER WATCHING

09:35.233 --> 09:37.000
THAT CLIP, AND IT TURNS OUT,

09:37.066 --> 09:38.033
HE'S A LOT.

09:38.100 --> 09:39.633
FOR EXAMPLE, GREG HAS A WEBSITE

09:39.700 --> 09:40.800
WHERE YOU CAN FIND CLASSIC

09:40.867 --> 09:42.200
"GREGISMS" LIKE

09:42.266 --> 09:44.000
"ENVIRONMENTALISM IS EVIL," OR

09:44.066 --> 09:45.300
"THE BAPTISTS ARE THE PIN IN THE

09:45.367 --> 09:46.266
HOMO GRENADE."

09:46.333 --> 09:49.567
INCIDENTALLY, "GREGISMS" ISN'T A

09:49.633 --> 09:50.867
EVEN TERM I MADE UP, IT'S AN

09:50.934 --> 09:53.266
ACTUAL SECTION OF HIS WEBSITE.

09:53.333 --> 09:55.667
WE COULD HONESTLY SPEND THE REST

09:55.734 --> 09:57.066
OF THIS SHOW ON GREG, BUT SADLY,

09:57.133 --> 09:57.500
WE HAVE TO MOVE ON.

09:57.567 --> 09:58.066
BECAUSE THE IMPORTANT THING

09:58.133 --> 09:58.800
ABOUT JURY DUTY IS -- YOU KNOW

09:58.867 --> 09:59.734
WHAT?

09:59.800 --> 10:01.266
JUST ONE MORE THING ABOUT GREG.

10:01.333 --> 10:02.000
HE'S BEEN TWEETING "IT'S ALMOST

10:02.066 --> 10:02.867
TIME TO HAVE A GREAT #Weekend

10:02.934 --> 10:03.834
EVERYONE!

10:03.900 --> 10:06.633
WHO'S WITH ME?" EVERY FRIDAY FOR

10:06.700 --> 10:09.200
THE LAST VERY MANY FRIDAYS, AND

10:09.266 --> 10:18.333
READ THE ROOM, GREG.

10:18.400 --> 10:19.400
NO ONE HAS GREAT #Weekends

10:19.467 --> 10:20.200
ANYMORE.

10:20.266 --> 10:20.834
WE'RE ALL SITTING AT HOME

10:20.900 --> 10:21.567
WATCHING THE DAYS BLUR TOGETHER

10:21.633 --> 10:22.400
IN A MISERABLE #TimeSoup.

10:22.467 --> 10:23.066
BUT WHILE IT MIGHT SOUND CLICHE,

10:23.133 --> 10:23.800
SERVING ON A JURY REALLY IS AN

10:23.867 --> 10:24.500
ESSENTIAL CIVIC DUTY.

10:24.567 --> 10:25.300
THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY AN

10:25.367 --> 10:26.300
IMPARTIAL JURY OF YOUR PEERS IS

10:26.367 --> 10:27.300
ENSHRINED IN THE SIXTH AMENDMENT

10:27.367 --> 10:29.033
OF THE CONSTITUTION.

10:29.066 --> 10:30.000
BUT THE TRUTH IS, WHILE

10:30.066 --> 10:30.967
"YOUR PEERS" ARE SUPPOSED BE

10:31.033 --> 10:33.233
CHOSEN FROM A FAIR CROSS-SECTION

10:33.300 --> 10:34.967
OF SOCIETY, PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE

10:35.033 --> 10:36.967
ROUTINELY EXCLUDED.

10:37.033 --> 10:38.100
ACCORDING TO A STUDY OF

10:38.166 --> 10:39.834
14 FEDERAL DISTRICT COURTS,

10:39.900 --> 10:41.333
UNDERREPRESENTATION OF THE

10:41.400 --> 10:43.200
LATINO AND AFRICAN AMERICAN

10:43.266 --> 10:45.066
POPULATIONS IS "UBIQUITOUS,"

10:45.133 --> 10:46.166
WHICH IS A PROBLEM WITH HUGE

10:46.233 --> 10:47.500
IMPLICATIONS FOR JURIES.

10:47.567 --> 10:49.033
THIS SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGIST STAGED

10:49.100 --> 10:50.266
MOCK CASES WHERE SOME JURIES

10:50.333 --> 10:51.667
WERE ALL WHITE AND OTHERS WERE

10:51.734 --> 10:53.300
RACIALLY DIVERSE AND FOUND THE

10:53.367 --> 10:56.166
DIVERSE ONES OPERATED MORE

10:56.233 --> 10:57.834
FAIRLY AND DELIBERATED MORE

10:57.900 --> 11:00.200
COMPREHENSIVELY.

11:00.266 --> 11:01.600
>> IN THIS STUDY, THEY -- THEY

11:01.667 --> 11:03.033
RAISED MORE FACTS FROM THE

11:03.100 --> 11:04.033
TRIAL, THEY DISCUSS A BROADER

11:04.100 --> 11:05.433
RANGE OF INFORMATION, THEY

11:05.500 --> 11:06.967
DISCUSS THE INFORMATION MORE

11:07.033 --> 11:07.967
ACCURATELY, ACTUALLY, IN

11:08.033 --> 11:08.667
DISCUSSING THE FACTS OF THE

11:08.734 --> 11:09.700
CASE.

11:09.767 --> 11:11.767
THEY'RE MORE WILLING TO HAVE

11:11.834 --> 11:13.633
UNCOMFORTABLE CONVERSATIONS

11:13.700 --> 11:14.967
ABOUT CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES LIKE

11:15.033 --> 11:16.266
THOSE INVOLVING RACE AND RACIAL

11:16.333 --> 11:18.033
PROFILING.

11:18.100 --> 11:19.200
>> John: YEAH, IT TURNS OUT

11:19.266 --> 11:20.467
JURIES ARE SORT OF LIKE

11:20.533 --> 11:21.300
PRESIDENTS OF THE SPOKANE,

11:21.367 --> 11:22.233
WASHINGTON, CHAPTER OF THE

11:22.300 --> 11:23.633
NAACP.

11:23.700 --> 11:25.333
WHEN THEY'RE ENTIRELY WHITE,

11:25.400 --> 11:27.567
THINGS TEND TO GO SOUTH FAST.

11:27.600 --> 11:28.667
AND THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE

11:28.767 --> 11:29.800
REAL WORLD.

11:29.867 --> 11:31.033
RESEARCHERS WHO EXAMINED FELONY

11:31.100 --> 11:32.500
TRIALS IN FLORIDA FOUND THAT

11:32.567 --> 11:34.467
JURIES FORMED FROM ALL-WHITE

11:34.533 --> 11:35.900
POOLS CONVICT BLACK DEFENDANTS A

11:35.967 --> 11:37.500
FULL 16 PERCENTAGE POINTS MORE

11:37.567 --> 11:38.400
OFTEN THAN THEY DO WHITE

11:38.467 --> 11:40.166
DEFENDANTS.

11:40.233 --> 11:41.600
BUT THAT GAP IN CONVICTION RATES

11:41.667 --> 11:43.333
IS ENTIRELY ELIMINATED WHEN THE

11:43.400 --> 11:45.000
POOL INCLUDES AT LEAST ONE BLACK

11:45.066 --> 11:46.700
MEMBER.

11:46.767 --> 11:48.066
AND THAT'S ONE OF THOSE FACTS

11:48.133 --> 11:49.166
THAT YOU PROBABLY ASSUMED WAS

11:49.233 --> 11:50.100
TRUE, EVEN THOUGH YOU WISH IT

11:50.166 --> 11:51.300
WASN'T.

11:51.367 --> 11:52.934
LIKE THE FACT THAT DOGS DON'T

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
REALLY ENJOY MUSIC OR THAT

11:54.066 --> 11:55.233
SEAN PENN'S NEW WIFE IS A YEAR

11:55.300 --> 11:57.266
YOUNGER THAN HIS DAUGHTER.

11:57.333 --> 11:59.066
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT

11:59.133 --> 12:00.700
WHY JURIES ARE SO OFTEN

12:00.767 --> 12:01.967
UNREPRESENTATIVE AND WHAT WE CAN

12:02.033 --> 12:03.333
DO ABOUT IT.

12:03.400 --> 12:04.367
AND THE WHOLE PROCESS STARTS

12:04.433 --> 12:05.633
WITH WHAT'S CALLED A

12:05.700 --> 12:07.200
"JURY WHEEL" -- A POOL OF

12:07.266 --> 12:08.834
POTENTIAL JURORS IN A COMMUNITY.

12:08.900 --> 12:10.633
IT USED TO BE AN ACTUAL WHEEL,

12:10.700 --> 12:11.967
AND FOR MANY YEARS, BLACK PEOPLE

12:12.033 --> 12:13.333
WERE EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED FROM

12:13.400 --> 12:14.500
THEM.

12:14.567 --> 12:15.467
AND EVEN AFTER THE CIVIL RIGHTS

12:15.533 --> 12:16.934
ACT OF 1875 SAID YOU COULDN'T

12:17.000 --> 12:18.567
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST JURORS

12:18.633 --> 12:20.800
BASED ON RACE, MANY OFFICIALS

12:20.867 --> 12:22.700
WOULD STILL FIND WAYS TO REMOVE

12:22.767 --> 12:24.400
THEM, LIKE BY PRINTING THEIR

12:24.467 --> 12:25.734
NAMES ON DIFFERENT COLOR PAPER

12:25.800 --> 12:27.200
SO THEY COULD BE AVOIDED DURING

12:27.266 --> 12:28.767
THE SUPPOSEDLY RANDOM DRAWINGS.

12:28.834 --> 12:30.000
AND WHILE THANKFULLY THAT

12:30.066 --> 12:31.500
DOESN'T HAPPEN ANYMORE, OUR

12:31.567 --> 12:32.667
CURRENT SYSTEM HAS MANY FLAWS

12:32.734 --> 12:33.700
THAT CAN END UP HAVING A SIMILAR

12:33.767 --> 12:34.600
RESULT.

12:34.667 --> 12:35.633
FOR INSTANCE, NOWADAYS,

12:35.700 --> 12:37.000
JURY WHEELS ARE OFTEN

12:37.066 --> 12:38.033
COMPUTERIZED LISTS GATHERED FROM

12:38.100 --> 12:39.000
VOTER REGISTRATION AND DRIVER'S

12:39.066 --> 12:40.567
LICENSE RECORDS.

12:40.633 --> 12:41.967
BUT THERE'S A BIG PROBLEM THERE,

12:42.033 --> 12:43.166
AS THIS PUBLIC DEFENDER IN

12:43.233 --> 12:45.100
NEW ORLEANS EXPLAINS:

12:45.166 --> 12:46.367
>> NOT EVERYBODY'S REGISTERED TO

12:46.433 --> 12:48.133
VOTE AND NOT EVERYBODY OWNS A

12:48.200 --> 12:49.166
CAR AND, YOU KNOW, HAS A

12:49.233 --> 12:50.734
DRIVER'S LICENSE.

12:50.800 --> 12:52.233
THE PROBLEM IS WHEN WE USE VOTER

12:52.300 --> 12:53.633
REGISTRATION OR DMV RECORDS,

12:53.700 --> 12:54.667
WE'RE -- WE'RE PROBABLY

12:54.734 --> 12:56.767
EXCLUDING AROUND 35% OF

12:56.834 --> 12:57.667
NEW ORLEANIANS.

12:57.734 --> 12:59.133
>> John: RIGHT.

12:59.200 --> 12:59.900
35% OF PEOPLE ARE EXCLUDED

12:59.967 --> 13:01.567
THERE.

13:01.633 --> 13:02.600
AND BEING REGISTERED TO VOTE AND

13:02.667 --> 13:03.700
OWNING A CAR DOESN'T AFFECT

13:03.767 --> 13:04.667
WHETHER YOU'RE QUALIFIED TO

13:04.734 --> 13:06.066
SERVE ON A JURY.

13:06.133 --> 13:07.066
IT JUST AFFECTS HOW MUCH MONEY

13:07.133 --> 13:08.166
YOU PROBABLY SPEND ON BUMPER

13:08.233 --> 13:09.266
STICKERS.

13:09.333 --> 13:10.600
BUMPER STICKERS: THINK OF THEM

13:10.667 --> 13:14.200
AS TRAFFIC TWITTER.

13:14.266 --> 13:15.233
THAT'S NOT A COMPLIMENT.

13:15.300 --> 13:16.233
AND THE EXCLUSIONS DON'T STOP

13:16.300 --> 13:17.467
THERE.

13:17.533 --> 13:18.667
MOST STATES BAN PEOPLE WITH

13:18.734 --> 13:20.033
FELONY CONVICTIONS, AND WITH

13:20.100 --> 13:21.300
JUROR PAY BEING INCREDIBLY LOW,

13:21.367 --> 13:22.633
LOWER-INCOME PEOPLE CAN BE

13:22.700 --> 13:24.000
UNABLE TO AFFORD TO TAKE PART,

13:24.066 --> 13:25.533
BOTH OF WHICH DISPROPORTIONATELY

13:25.600 --> 13:27.667
EXCLUDE PEOPLE OF COLOR.

13:27.734 --> 13:29.533
SO INHERENTLY, THE SYSTEM IS

13:29.600 --> 13:31.433
ALREADY BIASED.

13:31.500 --> 13:33.600
AND THAT'S BEFORE YOU EVEN GET

13:33.667 --> 13:34.600
INTO THE MISTAKES JURY SUMMONING

13:34.667 --> 13:36.900
SYSTEMS CAN MAKE -- WHICH, TO BE

13:36.967 --> 13:37.700
FAIR, CAN SOMETIMES BE PRETTY

13:37.767 --> 13:38.934
FUN.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.533
>> I GOT JERRY DUTY.

13:40.600 --> 13:43.667
I SAID, "WHAT'S JERRY DUTY?"

13:43.734 --> 13:45.166
SUMMONED FOR JERRY -- JURY

13:45.233 --> 13:46.500
SERVICE.

13:46.567 --> 13:48.533
IF YOU'RE PICKED, THEN YOU GO UP

13:48.600 --> 13:50.266
TO THE JUDGE AND THEN YOU SAY IF

13:50.333 --> 13:52.900
THEY'RE GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY.

13:52.967 --> 13:55.367
>> John: YEAH!

13:55.433 --> 13:55.934
JACOB GOT JERRY DUTY.

13:56.000 --> 13:56.834
AND WHILE I CAN'T BELIEVE HE

13:56.900 --> 13:57.734
FOUND CASEY ANTHONY NOT GUILTY,

13:57.800 --> 13:58.700
THAT'S WHAT HE AND HIS JERRY

13:58.767 --> 13:59.600
DECIDED, AND WE JUST NEED TO

13:59.667 --> 14:01.367
LIVE WITH THAT.

14:01.433 --> 14:02.467
BUT SOME ERRORS ARE

14:02.533 --> 14:03.967
SIGNIFICANTLY LESS FUN.

14:04.033 --> 14:05.300
FOR INSTANCE, IN CONNECTICUT, IT

14:05.367 --> 14:06.734
EMERGED THAT THEIR JURY

14:06.800 --> 14:08.000
SELECTION COMPUTER PROGRAM HAD

14:08.066 --> 14:09.800
ACCIDENTALLY READ THE "D" IN

14:09.867 --> 14:10.900
"HARTFORD" TO MEAN "DECEASED."

14:10.967 --> 14:12.500
SO FOR NEARLY THREE YEARS, IT

14:12.567 --> 14:13.700
NEVER SUMMONED ANYONE FROM

14:13.767 --> 14:15.133
HARTFORD -- OR, INDEED,

14:15.200 --> 14:16.734
NEW BRITAIN, THE SECOND-LARGEST

14:16.800 --> 14:18.967
CITY IN THAT DISTRICT, BECAUSE

14:19.033 --> 14:20.900
THEIR LIST OF NAMES HAD BEEN

14:20.967 --> 14:21.867
ACCIDENTALLY MISPLACED AND WAS

14:21.934 --> 14:22.834
NEVER ENTERED INTO THE PROGRAM.

14:22.900 --> 14:24.100
AND THE THING IS, THOSE TWO

14:24.166 --> 14:25.734
MISSING CITIES ACCOUNTED FOR

14:25.800 --> 14:27.467
63% OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THE

14:27.533 --> 14:30.000
DISTRICT AND 68% OF THE HISPANIC

14:30.066 --> 14:31.667
POPULATION.

14:31.734 --> 14:33.834
WHICH IS HORRIBLE.

14:33.900 --> 14:34.934
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE GOING TO

14:35.000 --> 14:36.200
FORGET A TOWN IN CONNECTICUT,

14:36.266 --> 14:37.033
WHY NOT FORGET DANBURY?

14:37.100 --> 14:37.667
BECAUSE -- AND THIS IS TRUE --

14:37.734 --> 14:38.867
FUCK DANBURY!

14:38.934 --> 14:40.300
FROM ITS CHARMING RAILWAY MUSEUM

14:40.367 --> 14:41.767
TO ITS HISTORIC HEARTHSTONE

14:41.834 --> 14:43.433
CASTLE, DANBURY, CONNECTICUT,

14:43.500 --> 14:46.033
CAN EAT MY WHOLE ASS.

14:46.100 --> 14:47.900
I KNOW THREE THINGS ABOUT

14:47.967 --> 14:49.433
DANBURY: "USA TODAY" RANKED IT

14:49.500 --> 14:50.834
THE SECOND-BEST CITY TO LIVE IN

14:50.900 --> 14:52.500
IN 2015, IT WAS ONCE THE CENTER

14:52.567 --> 14:53.834
OF THE AMERICAN HAT INDUSTRY,

14:53.900 --> 14:55.300
AND IF YOU'RE FROM THERE, YOU'VE

14:55.367 --> 14:56.633
GOT A STANDING INVITE TO COME

14:56.700 --> 14:57.433
GET A THRASHING FROM

14:57.500 --> 14:58.367
JOHN OLIVER.

14:58.433 --> 14:59.367
CHILDREN INCLUDED.

14:59.433 --> 15:02.300
FUCK YOU.

15:02.367 --> 15:03.400
NOW, THAT HARTFORD ERROR WAS

15:03.467 --> 15:04.166
MADE BY THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN

15:04.233 --> 15:05.400
SYSTEM.

15:05.467 --> 15:06.467
BUT MANY COURTS ACTUALLY

15:06.533 --> 15:07.400
CONTRACT OUT THEIR JURY

15:07.467 --> 15:08.600
SELECTION TO COMPANIES LIKE

15:08.667 --> 15:09.667
THESE, WHO PROMISE TO RUN THE

15:09.734 --> 15:10.734
PROCESS CHEAPER AND MORE

15:10.800 --> 15:12.066
EFFICIENTLY.

15:12.133 --> 15:13.200
BUT PRIVATE COMPANIES CAN BE

15:13.266 --> 15:15.000
SURPRISINGLY UNRELIABLE.

15:15.066 --> 15:16.500
TAKE WHAT HAPPENED OUTSIDE

15:16.567 --> 15:17.467
TULSA, OKLAHOMA, WHERE A BLACK

15:17.533 --> 15:19.233
MAN WAS TRIED BY AN ALL-WHITE

15:19.300 --> 15:21.100
JURY, DRAWN FROM A POOL OF 200

15:21.166 --> 15:23.233
JURORS WITHOUT A SINGLE BLACK

15:23.300 --> 15:24.767
PERSON IN IT, AFTER THE COMPANY

15:24.834 --> 15:26.633
HANDLING JURY SELECTION

15:26.700 --> 15:28.066
ACCIDENTALLY EXCLUDED ZIP CODES

15:28.133 --> 15:29.734
WHERE 90% OF ITS BLACK RESIDENTS

15:29.800 --> 15:31.667
LIVED.

15:31.734 --> 15:33.133
THEN THERE'S ALLEN COUNTY,

15:33.200 --> 15:34.467
INDIANA, WHERE THIS COMPANY HAD

15:34.533 --> 15:35.834
A SYSTEM THAT WAS PROGRAMMED TO

15:35.900 --> 15:37.066
WORK THROUGH AN ALPHABETICAL

15:37.133 --> 15:38.900
LIST OF TOWNSHIPS AND STOP WHEN

15:38.967 --> 15:40.767
IT REACHED 10,000 NAMES.

15:40.834 --> 15:41.900
UNFORTUNATELY, IT TURNED OUT 75%

15:41.967 --> 15:43.967
OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THAT

15:44.033 --> 15:45.900
COUNTY HAPPENED TO LIVE IN

15:45.967 --> 15:47.800
WAYNE TOWNSHIP, TOWARDS THE END

15:47.867 --> 15:49.834
OF THE ALPHABET, MEANING THEY

15:49.900 --> 15:51.200
HAD ROUGHLY HALF THE CHANCE OF

15:51.266 --> 15:52.767
BEING INCLUDED ON A JURY THAN A

15:52.834 --> 15:53.800
TRULY RANDOM SYSTEM WOULD HAVE

15:53.867 --> 15:55.333
PRODUCED.

15:55.400 --> 15:57.433
SO YET AGAIN, ALPHABETIZATION

15:57.500 --> 15:58.800
FAILS US.

15:58.867 --> 16:00.567
I'VE SAID THIS FOR YEARS: IT'S

16:00.633 --> 16:02.066
AN ABC-SUPREMACIST SYSTEM THAT

16:02.133 --> 16:03.400
DISRESPECTS THE BETTER END OF

16:03.467 --> 16:04.767
THE ALPHABET.

16:04.834 --> 16:10.133
BECAUSE THINK ABOUT IT --

16:10.200 --> 16:12.300
Z HAS GOT ALL THE HOTTIES!

16:12.367 --> 16:12.900
ZAYN.

16:12.967 --> 16:13.600
ZOE.

16:13.667 --> 16:14.300
ZENDAYA.

16:14.367 --> 16:14.934
ZAC EFRON.

16:15.000 --> 16:15.767
AND OF COURSE, ZONKEYS --

16:15.834 --> 16:16.834
HALF ZEBRA, HALF DONKEY,

16:16.900 --> 16:18.367
ALL SEX.

16:18.433 --> 16:20.333
NOW, THE EXTENT OF THAT INDIANA

16:20.400 --> 16:21.500
ERROR ONLY EMERGED WHEN A MAN

16:21.567 --> 16:22.600
WHO'D BEEN CONVICTED THERE SUED

16:22.667 --> 16:23.867
OVER THE MAKEUP OF HIS JURY AND

16:23.934 --> 16:24.767
HIS LAWYER POINTED OUT TO THE

16:24.834 --> 16:27.000
STATE SUPREME COURT JUST HOW LAX

16:27.066 --> 16:29.967
THE DESIGN PROCESS HAD BEEN:

16:30.033 --> 16:32.266
>> IT'S NOT A GLITCH, NOT A

16:32.333 --> 16:34.100
GLITCH OR COMPUTER BUG, IT'S

16:34.166 --> 16:35.734
PROGRAMMING DETERMINATION.

16:35.800 --> 16:36.633
THESE ARE CODES.

16:36.700 --> 16:38.600
THESE ARE DETERMINATIONS THAT

16:38.667 --> 16:39.400
THE PROGRAMMER PUT INTO THE

16:39.500 --> 16:44.066
PROGRAM.

16:44.133 --> 16:44.934
IT DIDN'T -- SOME VIRUS COME IN

16:45.000 --> 16:45.767
AND MAKE THE PROGRAM GO BAD.

16:45.834 --> 16:46.934
IT WAS BAD BECAUSE HE MADE THESE

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
DECISIONS, AND EASILY THEY COULD

16:48.066 --> 16:49.133
HAVE BEEN PROGRAMMED ANOTHER

16:49.200 --> 16:50.300
WAY.

16:50.367 --> 16:51.300
THIS WAS A PART-TIME COLLEGE

16:51.367 --> 16:54.900
STUDENT.

16:54.967 --> 16:55.667
>> John: THAT'S TRUE.

16:55.734 --> 16:56.900
THAT COUNTY'S JURY SYSTEM WAS

16:56.967 --> 16:58.400
ORIGINALLY DESIGNED BY A COLLEGE

16:58.467 --> 16:58.967
STUDENT WHOSE PREVIOUS JOB,

16:59.033 --> 17:00.133
INCIDENTALLY, HAD BEEN WORKING

17:00.200 --> 17:01.700
AT A HEAD SHOP.

17:01.767 --> 17:03.100
AND LOOK, THERE ARE PLENTY OF

17:03.166 --> 17:05.367
JOBS THAT PEOPLE WITH HEAD SHOP

17:05.433 --> 17:06.133
EXPERIENCE ARE QUALIFIED TO DO.

17:06.200 --> 17:06.867
FOR INSTANCE, CLEANING BONG

17:06.934 --> 17:08.000
RESIN OFF AN IKEA COUCH CUSHION

17:08.066 --> 17:09.800
OR GOING ON A LATE-NIGHT SNACK

17:09.867 --> 17:11.000
RUN TO 7-11 AND ONLY GETTING 40%

17:11.066 --> 17:13.266
OF WHAT EVERYONE ASKED FOR.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.166
I'M JUST NOT SURE "PROGRAMMING A

17:15.233 --> 17:16.333
COUNTY'S OFFICIAL JURY LIST" IS

17:16.400 --> 17:17.834
ONE OF THOSE JOBS.

17:17.900 --> 17:19.133
AND WHETHER THE ERRORS IN THESE

17:19.200 --> 17:21.100
PROGRAMS WERE DELIBERATE OR JUST

17:21.166 --> 17:22.400
CARELESS, THE RESULT IS THE

17:22.467 --> 17:23.867
SAME.

17:23.934 --> 17:25.133
AND I'D LOVE TO TELL YOU

17:25.200 --> 17:28.667
MISTAKES LIKE THESE ARE RARE.

17:28.734 --> 17:30.133
BUT THE TRUTH IS, NO ONE KNOWS

17:30.200 --> 17:31.033
HOW COMMON THEY ARE.

17:31.100 --> 17:35.100
WE ONLY KNOW ABOUT THE EXAMPLES

17:35.166 --> 17:36.367
THAT I MENTIONED SO FAR BECAUSE

17:36.433 --> 17:36.934
OF LAWSUITS THAT TOOK YEARS.

17:37.000 --> 17:37.600
PRIVATE VENDORS OFTEN WON'T

17:37.667 --> 17:38.266
REVEAL DETAILS ABOUT THEIR

17:38.333 --> 17:38.967
SYSTEMS, CLAIMING ALGORITHMS ARE

17:39.033 --> 17:40.200
A TRADE SECRET.

17:40.266 --> 17:41.400
AND 39 OUT OF 50 STATES PROVIDE

17:41.467 --> 17:42.800
NO PUBLIC ACCESS TO JURY POOL

17:42.867 --> 17:45.767
DATA.

17:45.834 --> 17:47.066
SO YOUR COURT SYSTEM MIGHT HAVE

17:47.133 --> 17:48.767
A MASSIVE PROBLEM, AND UNTIL A

17:48.834 --> 17:50.266
NINE-YEAR-OLD SHOWS UP FOR A

17:50.333 --> 17:51.400
MURDER TRIAL, NO ONE WOULD HAVE

17:51.467 --> 17:54.433
ANY IDEA.

17:54.500 --> 17:56.166
AND ALL THIS IS BEFORE JURORS

17:56.233 --> 17:57.233
EVEN SHOW UP FOR SELECTION, AT

17:57.300 --> 17:59.333
WHICH POINT, THINGS GET EVEN

17:59.400 --> 18:01.166
WORSE, BECAUSE PROSECUTORS TEND

18:01.233 --> 18:03.000
TO EXCLUDE BLACK JURORS,

18:03.066 --> 18:05.000
SOMETIMES OUT OF IMPLICIT BIAS,

18:05.066 --> 18:06.800
BUT SOMETIMES OUT OF BIAS THAT

18:06.867 --> 18:08.700
IS PRETTY FUCKING EXPLICIT.

18:08.767 --> 18:10.166
JUST WATCH THIS PHILADELPHIA

18:10.233 --> 18:12.433
D.A. ADDRESSING A ROOMFUL OF

18:12.500 --> 18:13.500
PROSECUTORS IN A LEAKED 1980s

18:13.567 --> 18:14.533
TRAINING VIDEO, EXPLAINING WHICH

18:14.600 --> 18:17.367
JURORS THEY MIGHT WANT TO AVOID.

18:17.433 --> 18:22.133
>> ANOTHER FACTOR, I'LL TELL YOU

18:22.200 --> 18:25.133
>> ANOTHER FACTOR, I'LL TELL

18:25.200 --> 18:25.834
YOU, IF, YOU KNOW, IN SELECTING

18:25.900 --> 18:26.433
BLACKS, AGAIN, YOU DON'T WANT

18:26.500 --> 18:26.934
THE REAL EDUCATED ONES.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.133
AGAIN IT'S -- THIS GOES ACROSS

18:28.200 --> 18:30.400
THE BOARD OF ALL RACES.

18:30.467 --> 18:32.266
YOU DON'T WANT SMART PEOPLE.

18:32.333 --> 18:34.500
AND AGAIN -- BUT IF YOU -- IF

18:34.567 --> 18:35.700
YOU -- IF YOU'RE SITTING DOWN

18:35.767 --> 18:37.467
AND YOU'RE GONNA TAKE BLACKS,

18:37.533 --> 18:37.967
YOU WANT OLDER BLACKS.

18:38.033 --> 18:38.734
IN MY EXPERIENCE, BLACK WOMEN,

18:38.800 --> 18:39.500
YOUNG BLACK WOMEN ARE VERY BAD.

18:39.567 --> 18:40.400
THERE'S AN ANTAGONISM.

18:40.467 --> 18:41.233
I GUESS MAYBE BECAUSE THEY'RE

18:41.300 --> 18:42.400
DOWNTRODDEN ON TWO RESPECTS.

18:42.467 --> 18:43.600
THEY GOT TWO MINORITIES --

18:43.633 --> 18:45.433
THEY'RE WOMEN AND THEY'RE BLACKS

18:45.500 --> 18:46.033
AND SO THEY'RE DOWNTRODDEN ON

18:46.133 --> 18:47.633
TWO AREAS AND THEY SOMEHOW WANT

18:47.700 --> 18:49.033
TO TAKE IT OUT ON SOMEBODY, AND

18:49.100 --> 18:51.667
YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE YOU.

18:51.734 --> 18:53.600
>> John: OKAY, FIRST, ANY WHITE

18:53.667 --> 18:55.767
PEOPLE WHO USE THE WORD "BLACK"

18:55.834 --> 18:57.200
AS A NOUN AND NOT AN ADJECTIVE

18:57.266 --> 18:58.567
ARE PRETTY SUSPICIOUS.

18:58.633 --> 19:01.433
THROW IN THAT MUSTACHE AND

19:01.500 --> 19:02.567
SUDDENLY IT FEELS LIKE

19:02.633 --> 19:03.266
A SPIKE LEE PERIOD PIECE.

19:03.333 --> 19:04.066
AND EVEN PUTTING ASIDE THE

19:04.133 --> 19:05.233
BIGOTRY THERE, THE ONLY TIME

19:05.300 --> 19:06.500
IT'S ACCEPTABLE TO SAY "WE DON'T

19:06.567 --> 19:07.633
WANT SMART PEOPLE" IS IN A

19:07.700 --> 19:08.700
TRAINING MANUAL FOR SELLING

19:08.767 --> 19:10.333
LULAROE.

19:10.400 --> 19:11.734
BECAUSE IF YOUR BUSINESS MODEL

19:11.800 --> 19:12.900
IS "SELL 5,000 UGLY LEGGINGS ON

19:12.967 --> 19:14.600
FACEBOOK TO THE PEOPLE WHO HATED

19:14.667 --> 19:15.767
YOU IN HIGH SCHOOL," THEN, YEAH,

19:15.834 --> 19:17.100
YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO WEED OUT

19:17.166 --> 19:18.900
THE SMART PEOPLE.

19:18.967 --> 19:20.467
NOW WE REACHED OUT TO THAT

19:20.533 --> 19:21.767
PROSECUTOR, WHO WAS UPSET,

19:21.834 --> 19:23.934
SAYING, "EVERYONE HAS TRIED TO

19:24.000 --> 19:25.767
SOMEHOW MAKE THIS RACIST," EVEN

19:25.834 --> 19:28.200
THOUGH HE AGREED THAT "THE BEST

19:28.266 --> 19:29.266
JURY IS BIRACIAL."

19:29.333 --> 19:30.767
SOMETHING SLIGHTLY UNDERCUT BY

19:30.834 --> 19:32.767
THE FACT THAT, A, YOU JUST HEARD

19:32.834 --> 19:33.967
HIM SAY "YOUNG BLACK WOMEN ARE

19:34.033 --> 19:38.500
VERY BAD," AND B, A LATER REVIEW

19:38.567 --> 19:39.900
OF FELONY CASES THAT HE'D TRIED

19:39.967 --> 19:41.300
FOUND HE'D REMOVED BLACK JURORS

19:41.367 --> 19:43.166
AT SUCH A HIGH RATE, THE ODDS OF

19:43.233 --> 19:44.600
IT HAPPENING BY CHANCE WERE ONE

19:44.667 --> 19:45.333
IN A QUADRILLION.

19:45.400 --> 19:46.500
AND THAT GUY'S NOT A ONE-OFF.

19:46.567 --> 19:47.400
RECENT STUDIES IN NORTH CAROLINA

19:47.467 --> 19:49.367
AND LOUISIANA FOUND PROSECUTORS

19:49.433 --> 19:50.900
STRIKING BLACK JURORS AT TWICE

19:50.967 --> 19:52.233
AND THREE TIMES THE RATE OF

19:52.300 --> 19:53.934
WHITE JURORS.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.533
AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING HOW THEY

19:57.600 --> 19:58.800
WERE ABLE TO DO THAT, IT'S WORTH

19:58.867 --> 19:59.433
KNOWING, IN A TRIAL, LAWYERS

19:59.500 --> 20:01.033
HAVE TWO WAYS TO REMOVE JURORS.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.934
THE FIRST IS A SO-CALLED

20:03.000 --> 20:03.800
CHALLENGE FOR CAUSE.

20:03.867 --> 20:05.633
THAT'S WHERE THEY CAN SHOW A

20:05.700 --> 20:06.767
JUROR CAN'T BE IMPARTIAL BECAUSE

20:06.834 --> 20:08.767
OF SOME CONNECTION TO THE TRIAL

20:08.834 --> 20:09.900
OR BECAUSE THEY'RE SOMEHOW UNFIT

20:09.967 --> 20:12.467
TO SERVE.

20:12.533 --> 20:13.300
THE SECOND IS A PEREMPTORY

20:13.367 --> 20:15.333
CHALLENGE, WHERE THEY CAN REMOVE

20:15.400 --> 20:17.066
A LIMITED NUMBER OF JURORS WITH

20:17.133 --> 20:18.700
NO EXPLANATION, ALTHOUGH SINCE A

20:18.767 --> 20:19.834
1986 SUPREME COURT RULING, THEY

20:19.900 --> 20:21.467
CAN'T EXCLUDE JURORS PURELY

20:21.533 --> 20:25.367
BASED ON RACE.

20:25.433 --> 20:27.200
IT'S SOMETHING THAT THIS HLN

20:27.266 --> 20:28.133
HOST EXPLAINS IN A BORDERLINE

20:28.200 --> 20:28.667
AGGRESSIVELY LITERAL WAY:

20:28.734 --> 20:29.700
>> WHAT HAPPENS IS, THE

20:29.767 --> 20:32.000
PROSECUTION AND DEFENSE EACH

20:32.066 --> 20:34.834
HAVE TEN JURORS EACH THAT THEY

20:34.900 --> 20:36.900
CAN REJECT FOR ANY REASON AT ALL

20:36.967 --> 20:39.700
OR FOR NO REASON, UNLESS THEY

20:39.767 --> 20:42.266
BELIEVE THE OTHER SIDE IS

20:42.333 --> 20:43.633
PLAYING THE RACE CARD.

20:43.700 --> 20:48.433
AND THEY CAN THEN CHALLENGE THAT

20:48.500 --> 20:53.400
PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE.

20:53.467 --> 20:54.166
>> John: I'VE GOT A LOT OF

20:54.233 --> 20:54.800
QUESTIONS, AND NONE OF THEM ARE

20:54.867 --> 20:55.533
ABOUT PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES.

20:55.600 --> 20:56.600
FIRST, WHY USE THE LOADED TERM

20:56.667 --> 21:00.133
"PLAYING THE RACE CARD" AT ALL?

21:00.200 --> 21:00.734
SECOND, WHY IMPLY IT MEANS

21:00.800 --> 21:02.100
"ACTING IN A RACIST FASHION"

21:02.166 --> 21:02.834
WHEN IT DOESN'T?

21:02.900 --> 21:03.700
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, HOW LONG

21:03.767 --> 21:05.000
DID THAT MAN WALK AROUND WITH

21:05.066 --> 21:05.800
THAT "RACE CARD" IN HIS SUIT

21:05.867 --> 21:07.066
POCKET?

21:07.133 --> 21:08.867
WAS IT JUST FOR THE SHOW, OR

21:08.934 --> 21:09.700
DOES HE ALWAYS WALK AROUND WITH

21:09.767 --> 21:10.633
IT ON THE OFF-CHANCE HE HAS TO

21:10.700 --> 21:11.266
EXPLAIN PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES TO

21:11.333 --> 21:12.200
SOMEONE?

21:12.266 --> 21:13.200
IF SO, DOES HE EVER GO TO PAY

21:13.266 --> 21:14.433
FOR SOMETHING, ACCIDENTALLY PULL

21:14.500 --> 21:17.433
OUT HIS RACE CARD, AND THEN SAY,

21:17.500 --> 21:18.533
"OOPS, THAT'S NOT MY WALLET,

21:18.600 --> 21:19.133
THAT'S MY RACE CARD" TO THE

21:19.200 --> 21:20.200
UTTER BEWILDERMENT OF THE

21:20.266 --> 21:22.600
CASHIER?

21:22.667 --> 21:23.667
ALSO, HOW DID HE GET THAT CARD?

21:23.734 --> 21:26.300
DID HE MAKE IT HIMSELF?

21:26.367 --> 21:27.500
'CAUSE THAT'D BE WEIRD, BUT IT

21:27.567 --> 21:28.867
MIGHT ACTUALLY BE WEIRDER IF

21:28.934 --> 21:29.967
HE'D ASKED SOMEONE ELSE TO MAKE

21:30.033 --> 21:30.266
IT FOR HIM.

21:30.333 --> 21:30.834
THAT WOULD MEAN HE'D ASKED A

21:30.900 --> 21:31.600
PRODUCER, "HEY, CAN YOU MAKE ME

21:31.667 --> 21:32.433
A RACE CARD FOR MY SEGMENT ON

21:32.500 --> 21:33.166
JURY SELECTION?"

21:33.233 --> 21:33.867
TO WHICH THEY PROBABLY SAID,

21:33.934 --> 21:34.400
"WHAT DO YOU MEAN?"

21:34.467 --> 21:35.333
AND HE SAID, "YOU KNOW, LIKE A

21:35.400 --> 21:36.000
PHYSICAL CARD THAT SAYS 'RACE

21:36.066 --> 21:36.600
CARD' ON IT."

21:36.667 --> 21:37.667
AND THEN THE PRODUCER SAID,

21:37.734 --> 21:38.400
"WHY?"

21:38.467 --> 21:39.867
AND HE SAID, "BECAUSE I'M TRYING

21:39.934 --> 21:41.100
TO EXPLAIN LAWYERS PLAYING THE

21:41.166 --> 21:41.934
RACE CARD WHEN STRIKING JURORS."

21:42.000 --> 21:45.233
TO WHICH THE PRODUCER SAID,

21:45.300 --> 21:47.000
"BUT CAN'T YOU JUST SAY THE

21:47.066 --> 21:47.700
PHRASE 'PLAYING THE RACE CARD?

21:47.767 --> 21:48.567
OR, Y'KNOW, NOT ACTUALLY SAY IT

21:48.633 --> 21:50.066
AT ALL?'"

21:50.133 --> 21:50.667
AND HE SAID, "ABSOLUTELY NOT."

21:50.767 --> 21:51.633
SO A PRODUCTION ASSISTANT THEN

21:51.700 --> 21:53.000
SPENT 20 MINUTES PRINTING THE

21:53.066 --> 21:54.100
WORDS "RACE CARD" ON A RED CARD.

21:54.166 --> 21:56.100
IS THAT HOW IT CAME TO EXIST?

21:56.166 --> 21:57.066
AND WHAT HAPPENED TO IT AFTER

21:57.133 --> 21:57.867
THE SHOW?

21:57.934 --> 21:59.200
DID HE THROW IT AWAY?

21:59.266 --> 22:00.467
OR DID HE PUT IT ON HIS DESK

22:00.533 --> 22:01.367
JUST IN CASE HE EVER NEEDED IT

22:01.433 --> 22:02.900
AGAIN?

22:02.967 --> 22:04.000
AND IF SO, DID SOMEONE EVER WALK

22:04.066 --> 22:04.900
BY AND SAY, "HEY, WHAT THE FUCK

22:04.967 --> 22:05.567
IS THAT?"

22:05.633 --> 22:06.600
TO WHICH HE REPLIED, "OH, THAT'S

22:06.667 --> 22:07.467
JUST MY RACE CARD" AS IF THAT'S

22:07.533 --> 22:08.367
A NORMAL THING TO SAY OR TO

22:08.433 --> 22:13.166
HAVE?

22:13.233 --> 22:17.433
AND FINALLY, AND I KNOW THIS

22:17.500 --> 22:21.133
ISN'T THE MOST IMPORTANT

22:21.200 --> 22:21.800
THING -- WHY DOES IT

22:21.867 --> 22:22.400
SAY RACE "CARD" ON IT?

22:22.467 --> 22:22.967
IT'S ALREADY A CARD.

22:23.033 --> 22:23.567
SHOULDN'T IT JUST SAY "RACE?"

22:23.633 --> 22:24.133
BECAUSE ISN'T THE THING HE'S

22:24.200 --> 22:24.734
HOLDING UP THERE TECHNICALLY A

22:24.800 --> 22:25.400
"RACE CARD" CARD?

22:25.467 --> 22:26.233
AND IF SO, WHAT DOES THE FUCK

22:26.300 --> 22:26.700
DOES "THAT" MEAN?

22:26.767 --> 22:27.333
I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT

22:27.400 --> 22:28.000
THIS, AND I KNOW WE DON'T HAVE

22:28.066 --> 22:28.567
TIME, BUT I GUESS MY BROADER

22:28.633 --> 22:29.333
POINT IS, THERE ARE TWO WAYS FOR

22:29.400 --> 22:29.934
LAWYERS TO STRIKE JURORS, AND

22:30.000 --> 22:30.667
HLN IS A DEEPLY WEIRD TELEVISION

22:30.734 --> 22:31.533
NETWORK.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.700
BUT WHILE THE SUPREME COURT SAID

22:33.767 --> 22:34.834
YOU CAN'T STRIKE JURORS BASED ON

22:34.900 --> 22:36.600
RACE, IT TURNS OUT, THAT'S AN

22:36.667 --> 22:39.300
EASY RULE TO GET AROUND.

22:39.367 --> 22:42.033
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS COME UP

22:42.100 --> 22:43.200
WITH SOME REASON OTHER THAN RACE

22:43.266 --> 22:44.367
TO STRIKE A JUROR AND THEN DO IT

22:44.433 --> 22:45.400
ANYWAY.

22:45.467 --> 22:46.533
REMEMBER THAT LAWYER YOU SAW

22:46.600 --> 22:48.133
EARLIER?

22:48.200 --> 22:49.500
HE WAS SPEAKING AFTER THAT

22:49.567 --> 22:50.600
RULING WAS HANDED DOWN AND WAS

22:50.667 --> 22:51.967
OPENLY INSTRUCTING PROSECUTORS

22:52.033 --> 22:54.333
ON HOW NOT TO GET CAUGHT.

22:54.400 --> 22:55.000
>> LET'S SAY YOU STRIKE THREE

22:55.066 --> 22:58.734
BLACKS TO START WITH.

22:58.800 --> 22:59.900
FIRST THREE PEOPLE.

22:59.967 --> 23:01.333
AND THEN IT'S LIKE, THE DEFENSE

23:01.400 --> 23:02.500
ATTORNEY MAKES AN OBJECTION

23:02.567 --> 23:03.633
SAYING THAT YOU'RE STRIKING

23:03.700 --> 23:03.867
BLACKS.

23:03.934 --> 23:04.467
WELL, YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE

23:04.533 --> 23:08.300
TO GO BACK AND SAY, "OH, YEAH."

23:08.367 --> 23:08.934
MAKE SOMETHING UP ABOUT WHY HE

23:09.000 --> 23:09.333
DID IT.

23:09.400 --> 23:09.967
WRITE IT DOWN RIGHT THEN AND

23:10.033 --> 23:10.533
THERE.

23:10.600 --> 23:11.367
SO SOMETIMES UNDER THAT LINE,

23:11.433 --> 23:12.033
YOU MAY WANT TO ASK MORE

23:12.100 --> 23:12.667
QUESTIONS OF THOSE PEOPLE SO IT

23:12.734 --> 23:13.233
GIVES YOU MORE AMMUNITION TO

23:13.300 --> 23:14.400
MAKE AN ARTICULABLE REASON AS TO

23:14.467 --> 23:15.300
WHY YOU'RE STRIKING THEM AND NOT

23:15.367 --> 23:16.967
FOR RACE.

23:17.033 --> 23:18.033
>> John: WOW.

23:18.100 --> 23:18.967
IT'S PRETTY BIZARRE TO SEE A

23:19.033 --> 23:19.934
GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL SO

23:20.000 --> 23:20.834
FLAGRANTLY TEACHING PEOPLE HOW

23:20.900 --> 23:22.567
TO DO SOMETHING ILLEGAL.

23:22.633 --> 23:23.767
IT'S LIKE IF "HOW TO GET AWAY

23:23.834 --> 23:25.066
WITH MURDER" WAS AN EDUCATIONAL

23:25.133 --> 23:26.734
SERIES WHERE VIOLA DAVIS

23:26.800 --> 23:27.867
EXPLAINS HOW TO LITERALLY GET

23:27.934 --> 23:34.133
AWAY WITH MURDER.

23:34.200 --> 23:34.934
WHICH SHE'D ABSOLUTELY CRUSH, BY

23:35.000 --> 23:35.300
THE WAY.

23:35.367 --> 23:35.967
I WOULD GLADLY WATCH MULTIPLE

23:36.033 --> 23:36.567
SEASONS OF HER DESCRIBING IN

23:36.633 --> 23:37.200
VIVID DETAIL HOW TO DISMEMBER A

23:37.266 --> 23:37.800
CORPSE AND DISSOLVE THE BODY

23:37.867 --> 23:39.800
PARTS IN ACID.

23:39.867 --> 23:41.834
AND, LOOK, TO THIS DAY,

23:41.900 --> 23:45.633
PROSECUTORS USE A WIDE VARIETY

23:45.700 --> 23:47.700
OF BULLSHIT REASONS TO STRIKE

23:47.767 --> 23:48.367
BLACK JURORS,

23:48.433 --> 23:49.000
SOME OF WHICH ARE JUST FLAT-OUT

23:49.066 --> 23:49.767
RIDICULOUS, LIKE SAYING JURORS

23:49.834 --> 23:50.800
WERE TOO YOUNG, TOO OLD, SINGLE,

23:50.867 --> 23:52.000
DIVORCED, RELIGIOUS OR NOT

23:52.066 --> 23:53.333
RELIGIOUS, LIVED IN A POOR PART

23:53.400 --> 23:54.700
OF TOWN, HAD A HYPHENATED LAST

23:54.767 --> 23:56.900
NAME, DISPLAYED BAD POSTURE, OR

23:56.967 --> 23:58.633
WERE SULLEN, DISRESPECTFUL, OR

23:58.700 --> 24:00.233
TALKATIVE.

24:00.300 --> 24:02.467
IN FACT, JUST LISTEN TO THIS

24:02.533 --> 24:03.767
PUBLIC DEFENDER DESCRIBE A JUROR

24:03.834 --> 24:05.200
STRIKE HE ONCE SAW:

24:05.266 --> 24:06.133
>> I HAD A JUROR, AN

24:06.200 --> 24:07.367
AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN, WHO WAS

24:07.433 --> 24:08.900
ACTUALLY EXCLUDED BECAUSE SHE

24:08.967 --> 24:09.734
WAS WEARING WHAT'S CALLED A

24:09.800 --> 24:13.000
"PUFFY COAT."

24:13.066 --> 24:13.967
>> John: YEAH.

24:14.033 --> 24:15.500
SHE WAS EXCLUDED FOR

24:15.567 --> 24:16.900
WEARING A PUFFY COAT.

24:16.967 --> 24:17.734
A JACKET SHOULD NEVER BE AN

24:17.800 --> 24:19.000
ACCEPTABLE REASON TO EXCLUDE

24:19.066 --> 24:22.200
SOMEONE FROM A JURY.

24:22.266 --> 24:23.000
UNLESS IT'S THE ONE THAT

24:23.066 --> 24:23.667
POST MALONE WORE TO

24:23.734 --> 24:24.367
THE AMERICAN MUSIC AWARDS.

24:24.433 --> 24:25.333
HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S SUPPOSED TO

24:25.400 --> 24:26.400
JUMP OUT OF A CAKE AT A

24:26.467 --> 24:27.300
MARIACHI-THEMED GENDER REVEAL

24:27.367 --> 24:28.633
PARTY.

24:28.700 --> 24:29.633
AND IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE

24:29.700 --> 24:30.433
LENGTHS TO WHICH PROSECUTORS ARE

24:30.500 --> 24:31.800
WILLING TO GO, JUST LOOK AT THE

24:31.867 --> 24:32.967
MULTIPLE MURDER TRIALS OF CURTIS

24:33.033 --> 24:34.734
FLOWERS IN MISSISSIPPI.

24:34.800 --> 24:36.834
HIS CASE MADE IT ALL THE WAY TO

24:36.900 --> 24:39.767
THE SUPREME COURT, WHICH DECIDED

24:39.834 --> 24:41.967
THAT HIS PROSECUTOR HAD

24:42.033 --> 24:43.166
REPEATEDLY AND BLATANTLY TRIED

24:43.233 --> 24:43.934
TO WHITEWASH THE JURY.

24:44.000 --> 24:44.767
AND THAT OPINION WAS WRITTEN BY

24:44.834 --> 24:45.700
MAYBE THE LAST JUSTICE YOU'D

24:45.767 --> 24:47.133
EXPECT.

24:47.200 --> 24:48.700
>> JUSTICE BRETT KAVANAUGH WROTE

24:48.767 --> 24:50.000
THAT A WHITE MISSISSIPPI

24:50.066 --> 24:52.033
PROSECUTOR'S GOAL WAS TO HAVE AN

24:52.100 --> 24:53.333
ALL-WHITE JURY DECIDE THE FATE

24:53.400 --> 24:55.033
OF AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN

24:55.100 --> 24:56.233
ACCUSED OF MURDER, WHICH IS

24:56.333 --> 24:58.033
UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

24:58.066 --> 24:59.333
THE COURT'S NEWEST JUSTICE

24:59.400 --> 25:00.600
SAID THAT DISTRICT ATTORNEY

25:00.667 --> 25:01.734
DOUG EVANS WAGED A "RELENTLESS,

25:01.800 --> 25:03.467
DETERMINED EFFORT TO RID THE

25:03.533 --> 25:07.433
JURY OF BLACK INDIVIDUALS."

25:07.500 --> 25:08.300
IT WAS CURTIS FLOWERS' SIXTH

25:08.367 --> 25:09.300
TRIAL FOR THE SAME QUADRUPLE

25:09.367 --> 25:10.834
MURDER.

25:10.900 --> 25:13.200
KAVANAUGH POINTED TO A PATTERN,

25:13.266 --> 25:14.667
NOTING THAT EVANS HAD REMOVED

25:14.734 --> 25:16.033
41 OF THE 42 PROSPECTIVE BLACK

25:16.100 --> 25:19.667
JURORS OVER THE SIX TRIALS.

25:19.734 --> 25:21.767
>> John: 41 OF 42 JURORS!

25:21.834 --> 25:23.266
YOU KNOW YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING

25:23.333 --> 25:24.533
WRONG WHEN IT'S SO FLAGRANT EVEN

25:24.600 --> 25:26.567
BRETT KAVANAUGH HAS A PROBLEM

25:26.633 --> 25:29.567
WITH IT -- A MAN WHO'S DONE

25:29.633 --> 25:30.533
EXACTLY TWO GOOD THINGS IN HIS

25:30.600 --> 25:31.467
LIFE: THIS DECISION AND MAKING

25:31.533 --> 25:32.467
IT ACCEPTABLE TO SPEND YOUR

25:32.533 --> 25:33.567
ENTIRE JOB INTERVIEW SCREAMING

25:33.633 --> 25:35.200
AND CRYING.

25:35.266 --> 25:36.567
AND IT WASN'T JUST HOW OFTEN

25:36.633 --> 25:37.500
THAT PROSECUTOR STRUCK BLACK

25:37.567 --> 25:38.600
JURORS -- IT'S HOW BLATANTLY HE

25:38.667 --> 25:40.066
DID IT.

25:40.133 --> 25:41.300
BECAUSE WHILE, ON AVERAGE, HE

25:41.367 --> 25:43.133
ASKED THE WHITE JURORS WHO WERE

25:43.200 --> 25:44.934
SEATED ONE QUESTION, HE ASKED

25:45.000 --> 25:49.333
THE BLACK JURORS HE STRUCK 29.

25:49.400 --> 25:50.834
AND HOW DO YOU ASK ANYONE THAT

25:50.900 --> 25:52.967
MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT ANYTHING?

25:53.033 --> 25:54.000
THAT'S TOO MANY, EVEN FOR A

25:54.066 --> 25:54.867
FIRST DATE WHO'S DESPERATELY

25:54.934 --> 25:56.100
TRYING TO KEEP THE CONVERSATION

25:56.166 --> 25:57.333
GOING.

25:57.400 --> 25:58.467
"LET'S SEE, I'VE ASKED ABOUT

25:58.533 --> 25:59.266
WHERE YOU GREW UP, WHAT YOU DO

25:59.333 --> 26:00.266
FOR WORK, WHETHER YOU LIKE YOUR

26:00.333 --> 26:01.233
JOB, WHETHER YOU HAVE ANY

26:01.300 --> 26:02.367
SIBLINGS, WHETHER YOUR SIBLINGS

26:02.433 --> 26:03.467
ARE OLDER OR YOUNGER, WHAT YOU

26:03.533 --> 26:04.467
LIKE TO DO FOR FUN, WHAT KIND OF

26:04.533 --> 26:08.967
MUSIC YOU LIKE...

26:09.033 --> 26:12.100
WHAT ELSE IS THERE?

26:12.166 --> 26:13.033
DO YOU LIKE RAKES?"

26:13.100 --> 26:13.934
AND A PROSPECTIVE JUROR IN ONE

26:14.000 --> 26:14.767
OF CURTIS FLOWERS' TRIALS FELT

26:14.834 --> 26:15.600
PRETTY CLEAR ABOUT WHY SHE'D

26:15.667 --> 26:16.300
BEEN STRUCK.

26:16.367 --> 26:17.333
>> THEY JUST TOLD US THEY DIDN'T

26:17.400 --> 26:18.266
NEED US.

26:18.333 --> 26:19.700
I THINK THEY MIGHT HAVE ASSUMED

26:19.767 --> 26:21.533
THAT BECAUSE I WAS BLACK THAT I

26:21.600 --> 26:23.133
WAS GOING TO AGREE WITH THAT HE

26:23.200 --> 26:24.266
WAS INNOCENT JUST BY THE COLOR

26:24.333 --> 26:25.300
OF HIS SKIN.

26:25.367 --> 26:26.633
BUT I ACTUALLY WOULD HAVE

26:26.700 --> 26:27.500
LISTENED TO THE EVIDENCE AND HAD

26:27.567 --> 26:28.367
AN OPEN EAR.

26:28.433 --> 26:29.400
I ACTUALLY WAS LOOKING FORWARD

26:29.467 --> 26:34.066
TO SERVING.

26:34.133 --> 26:34.800
>> John: LOOK, IT IS RIDICULOUS

26:34.867 --> 26:35.400
TO ASSUME THAT A JUROR WILL BE

26:35.467 --> 26:36.467
BIASED JUST BECAUSE THE

26:36.533 --> 26:37.100
DEFENDANT IS THE SAME RACE.

26:37.166 --> 26:38.433
OF COURSE A BLACK PERSON CAN BE

26:38.500 --> 26:39.166
IMPARTIAL WHEN THE DEFENDANT IS

26:39.233 --> 26:40.133
BLACK, IN THE SAME WAY THAT I

26:40.200 --> 26:41.500
COULD BE IMPARTIAL IF THE

26:41.567 --> 26:42.834
DEFENDANT WAS AN OWL.

26:42.900 --> 26:43.734
TO SUGGEST OTHERWISE IS

26:43.800 --> 26:44.867
EXTREMELY INSULTING, NOT JUST TO

26:44.934 --> 26:47.533
MYSELF, BUT TO ALL OWLS.

26:47.600 --> 26:48.700
AND THESE DECISIONS HAVE

26:48.767 --> 26:50.333
CONSEQUENCES.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.266
CURTIS FLOWERS SPENT 20 YEARS ON

26:52.333 --> 26:56.834
DEATH ROW AND IS CURRENTLY OUT

26:56.900 --> 26:57.633
ON BAIL AWAITING A POTENTIAL

26:57.700 --> 26:58.467
SEVENTH TRIAL.

26:58.533 --> 26:59.333
SO TAKEN ALL TOGETHER, IT'S

26:59.400 --> 27:00.433
CLEAR THAT, FROM HOW WE DECIDE

27:00.500 --> 27:01.700
WHO SERVES TO HOW THE LIST IS

27:01.767 --> 27:02.433
ADMINISTERED THROUGH WHO WE LET

27:02.500 --> 27:04.000
LAWYERS SELECT, WE'RE MAKING A

27:04.066 --> 27:05.333
MOCKERY OF THE PHRASE "A JURY OF

27:05.400 --> 27:06.567
YOUR PEERS."

27:06.633 --> 27:07.400
BECAUSE WHO, EXACTLY, IS THE

27:07.467 --> 27:08.633
"YOU" THERE?

27:08.700 --> 27:10.000
THE DEFENDANT'S PEERS?

27:10.066 --> 27:11.533
OR THE PROSECUTOR'S PEERS?

27:11.600 --> 27:14.667
THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE.

27:14.734 --> 27:16.200
AND AS WE'VE SEEN, THE IMPACT OF

27:16.266 --> 27:17.567
HAVING PEOPLE IN A JURY ROOM WHO

27:17.633 --> 27:20.934
CAN SPEAK TO WHAT BEING BLACK IN

27:21.000 --> 27:21.667
AMERICA IS LIKE AND HOW THAT

27:21.734 --> 27:22.500
MIGHT AFFECT YOUR RELATIONSHIP

27:22.567 --> 27:23.433
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN BE

27:23.500 --> 27:24.600
HUGELY BENEFICIAL.

27:24.667 --> 27:26.133
AND YES, THAT MIGHT MAKE A

27:26.200 --> 27:27.400
PROSECUTOR'S JOB A BIT MORE

27:27.467 --> 27:29.266
DIFFICULT, BUT THE ROLE OF A

27:29.333 --> 27:30.367
COURT IS NOT TO MAKE IT FUCKING

27:30.433 --> 27:32.533
EASY BY HAVING CASES HEARD ONLY

27:32.600 --> 27:34.500
BY A GROUP OF WHITE PEOPLE --

27:34.567 --> 27:35.633
OR, TO USE THE PROPER COLLECTIVE

27:35.700 --> 27:39.533
NOUN FOR THAT, "A WHOLE FOODS."

27:39.600 --> 27:40.700
I'M SERIOUS, TRY IT IN A

27:40.767 --> 27:41.400
SENTENCE.

27:41.467 --> 27:43.734
"LOOK AT THAT GAGGLE

27:43.800 --> 27:44.967
OF GEESE FLYING OVER THAT

27:45.033 --> 27:46.200
WHOLE FOODS OF ABIGAILS."

27:46.266 --> 27:46.767
SO HOW DO WE FIX THIS?

27:46.834 --> 27:47.667
WELL, THERE ARE FOUR BASIC STEPS

27:47.734 --> 27:48.400
WE COULD TAKE.

27:48.467 --> 27:49.166
ONE, BROADEN JURY POOL LISTS SO

27:49.233 --> 27:50.033
THEY DON'T EXCLUDE LARGE

27:50.100 --> 27:51.567
SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY.

27:51.633 --> 27:52.367
SOME HAVE SUGGESTED USING INCOME

27:52.433 --> 27:54.033
TAX LISTS, FOR INSTANCE.

27:54.100 --> 27:55.300
TWO, MAKE THAT DATA PUBLIC SO WE

27:55.367 --> 27:57.066
CAN SEE IF THERE WERE ERRORS IN

27:57.133 --> 27:58.934
COMPILING POTENTIAL JURORS.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.700
THIRD, INCREASE JUROR PAY SO

28:00.767 --> 28:02.066
THAT PEOPLE WHO MISS WORK DON'T

28:02.133 --> 28:04.500
SUFFER FINANCIAL HARDSHIP.

28:04.567 --> 28:05.667
AND FINALLY, REFORM THE PROCESS

28:05.734 --> 28:06.967
BEHIND PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES TO

28:07.033 --> 28:08.000
MAKE IT MORE PRACTICALLY

28:08.066 --> 28:09.400
DIFFICULT TO STRIKE JURORS BY

28:09.467 --> 28:10.233
RACE.

28:10.300 --> 28:13.367
AND WHILE, YES, THIS IS A LOT OF

28:13.433 --> 28:14.734
WORK, IT'S WORTH IT, BECAUSE AS

28:14.800 --> 28:17.233
WE'VE DISCUSSED BEFORE, EVERY

28:17.300 --> 28:19.000
GEAR IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

28:19.100 --> 28:20.633
SYSTEM IS UNFAIRLY BIASED

28:20.700 --> 28:22.133
AGAINST PEOPLE OF COLOR -- FROM

28:22.200 --> 28:23.700
POLICING TO BAIL TO THE SHORTAGE

28:23.767 --> 28:25.200
OF PUBLIC DEFENDERS TO PUNITIVE

28:25.266 --> 28:26.700
SENTENCING TO INCARCERATION TO

28:26.767 --> 28:28.633
RE-ENTRY FROM PRISON.

28:28.700 --> 28:30.100
AND THIS IS YET ANOTHER TO ADD

28:30.166 --> 28:31.433
TO THAT DEPRESSING LIST.

28:31.500 --> 28:32.667
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, TOO OFTEN,

28:32.734 --> 28:34.633
OUR CURRENT SYSTEM WOULD

28:34.700 --> 28:35.800
SYSTEMATICALLY WEED OUT A

28:35.867 --> 28:37.667
QUALIFIED PERSON WHO ACTUALLY

28:37.734 --> 28:39.100
WANTS TO SERVE AND LEAVE IN

28:39.166 --> 28:40.467
SOMEONE WHO AGGRESSIVELY DOESN'T

28:40.533 --> 28:41.633
BECAUSE HE CAN'T WATCH HBO AND

28:41.700 --> 28:42.734
FUCK IN THE JURY BOX.

28:42.800 --> 28:49.533
AND NOW THIS.

28:49.600 --> 28:51.333
>> Announcer: AND NOW, JIM

28:51.400 --> 28:53.333
CRAMER'S FUN TIME QUARANTINE

28:53.400 --> 28:55.900
ACTIVITY MAKES YOU SAD.

28:55.967 --> 28:58.967
>> WE HAVE SEEN SO MANY ZOOM

28:59.033 --> 29:00.266
ADAPTATIONS ON OUR NETWORK AND I

29:00.333 --> 29:03.033
HAVE HAD TO BE IN ZOOM BRUNCHES,

29:03.133 --> 29:03.567
WHATEVER.

29:03.633 --> 29:05.900
I'M NOT TELLING YOU TO DO YOUR

29:05.967 --> 29:06.900
BANKING ON ZOOM.

29:06.967 --> 29:08.467
I AM TELLING YOU TO DO YOUR

29:08.533 --> 29:13.033
BOOZY BRUNCH.

29:13.100 --> 29:16.867
OUR NOW -- MY BOOZY BRUNCH PAID

29:16.934 --> 29:18.900
FOR NEXT SATURDAY'S BOOZY

29:18.967 --> 29:19.433
BRUNCH.

29:19.500 --> 29:20.333
MY ZOOM BRUNCH.

29:20.400 --> 29:23.033
>> I YOU DO MY BOOZY BRUNCH.

29:23.100 --> 29:25.133
I CANNOT WAIT UNTIL SUNDAY,

29:25.200 --> 29:27.533
BECAUSE SUNDAY IS HER BOOZY

29:27.600 --> 29:29.100
BRUNCH ENABLED BY ZOOM.

29:29.166 --> 29:31.266
>> I WAS VICIOUSLY OVERSERVED

29:31.333 --> 29:32.667
LAST SUNDAY, EVEN THOUGH I AM

29:32.734 --> 29:34.467
LIVING ALONE.

29:44.700 --> 29:45.700
>> John: IT THAT'S OUR SHOW.
