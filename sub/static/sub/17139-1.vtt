00:04.760 --> 00:05.761
God...

01:03.720 --> 01:06.246
Toni Bevell, Men of Letters,
London Chapterhouse.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.401
<i>They sent me to take you in.</i>

01:07.560 --> 01:08.641
- Put the gun down.
- Stop.

01:08.800 --> 01:10.529
You and I both know
you're not gonna pull the trigger.

01:17.800 --> 01:19.928
AMARA: <i>You gave me
what I needed most.</i>

01:20.200 --> 01:21.884
<i>I wanna do the same for you.</i>

01:26.680 --> 01:27.522
Mom?

01:41.680 --> 01:43.170
I, uh...

01:45.560 --> 01:47.244
Are you...

01:48.240 --> 01:50.766
Really real?

02:04.240 --> 02:06.641
Where am I? Who the hell are you?

02:07.520 --> 02:12.447
I'm Dean... Winchester.
I'm your son.

02:14.040 --> 02:17.408
No, my Dean is four years old.

02:19.720 --> 02:21.324
I was when you died.

02:24.280 --> 02:26.521
Sammy? Sammy.

02:37.760 --> 02:38.761
Mom?

02:40.760 --> 02:43.161
Listen to me. Your name, your name
is Mary Sandra Campbell, okay?

02:43.320 --> 02:48.167
You were born December 5th, 1954
to Samuel and Deanna Campbell.

02:48.320 --> 02:51.005
Your father,
he bounced around a lot for work,

02:51.160 --> 02:54.209
and you bounced right along with him,
and you ended up in Lawrence, Kansas.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.081
How do you know all that?

02:58.400 --> 02:59.447
Dad told me.

03:03.400 --> 03:07.883
March 23rd, 1972,
you walked out of a movie theater.

03:08.080 --> 03:11.641
Slaughterhouse-Five. You loved it,
and you bumped into a big Marine.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.290
You knocked him flat on his ass.

03:14.760 --> 03:16.125
You were embarrassed,
and he laughed it off.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.169
Said you could make it up to him
with a cup of coffee.

03:18.520 --> 03:21.922
So you went to, uh, Mulroney's,
and you talked,

03:23.240 --> 03:27.802
and he was cute, and he knew the words
to every Zeppelin song.

03:27.960 --> 03:29.803
<i>So when he asked you for your number,
you gave it to him</i>

03:29.960 --> 03:32.122
<i>even though you knew
your dad would be pissed.</i>

03:32.960 --> 03:34.405
That was the night that, that you met...

03:34.560 --> 03:35.846
John Winchester.

03:37.960 --> 03:42.284
August 19th, 1975,
you were married in Reno,

03:42.960 --> 03:44.086
your idea.

03:44.800 --> 03:48.282
A few years later I came along,
then Sammy...

03:53.800 --> 03:55.165
And then I burned.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.684
How long have I been gone?

04:06.840 --> 04:07.841
Thirty-three years.

04:24.400 --> 04:25.401
Dean.

04:27.760 --> 04:28.761
Hi, Mom.

05:37.360 --> 05:38.407
Holy mother...

05:48.920 --> 05:49.921
Where am I?

05:50.680 --> 05:52.762
Uh... Earth?

05:53.080 --> 05:54.320
No...

05:55.680 --> 05:57.728
How far am I from Lebanon, Kansas?

05:58.680 --> 05:59.681
Uh...

06:00.320 --> 06:01.560
Three hours, maybe.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.765
Who... Wait, wait, wait.
Who, what are you, man?

06:21.320 --> 06:22.481
MARY: HOW did he die?

06:23.640 --> 06:25.847
DEAN: He gave himself up for me.

06:31.560 --> 06:33.528
That sounds like John.

06:39.960 --> 06:41.291
And he was a Hunter?

06:43.640 --> 06:45.722
And he raised you and Sam to...

06:47.240 --> 06:48.366
Yeah, he did.

06:55.480 --> 07:00.202
And you said we've met before,
when you traveled through time?

07:01.760 --> 07:02.921
Twice.

07:04.040 --> 07:06.088
Your memory got wiped. So...

07:07.640 --> 07:10.644
And I saw you when I was a ghost.

07:11.560 --> 07:13.369
Which I don't remember either.

07:15.840 --> 07:21.290
And God's sister brought me back to life?

07:23.480 --> 07:24.481
Pretty much.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.201
It's a lot.

07:31.800 --> 07:33.211
<i>And I know it's a lot.</i>

07:34.280 --> 07:36.408
And I'll explain everything. I will.

07:38.360 --> 07:40.966
But right now, let's get out of here.
Let's get you home.

07:43.800 --> 07:44.961
Come on, Mom.

08:02.080 --> 08:04.208
- Doctor Gregory Marion?
- Uh-huh.

08:04.400 --> 08:05.731
I need your help.

08:06.560 --> 08:08.642
- It's 6:00 a.m.
- It's an emergency.

08:08.840 --> 08:10.171
Lady, hold up.

08:10.320 --> 08:11.731
You have a clinic
at the back of your house.

08:11.880 --> 08:13.120
I trust it's fully stocked?

08:13.440 --> 08:15.488
Lady, lady, seriously.

08:16.120 --> 08:19.044
Unless your puggle got hit
by a car or something?

08:19.840 --> 08:21.604
- It can wait.
- It really can't.

08:32.280 --> 08:35.443
He was shot in the leg.
A single, .38 caliber bullet.

08:35.600 --> 08:37.409
I need the round dug out,
the wound sutured,

08:37.559 --> 08:39.448
and some anesthesia, to go.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.921
No. No way.

08:49.200 --> 08:50.281
I'm a veterinarian.

08:50.440 --> 08:52.522
Animals, people, they're all meat.

08:53.520 --> 08:55.966
<i>But, I understand
this is an unusual request,</i>

08:56.120 --> 08:58.691
<i>and I want to do everything I can
to ease your concerns.</i>

08:58.920 --> 09:00.729
Yeah, you know, not happening.
Mmm-mmm.

09:04.720 --> 09:05.767
Hear me out.

09:28.080 --> 09:31.004
This is stupid.
You think this is stupid, right?

09:31.160 --> 09:34.164
I think when Lucifer, Prince of Darkness,
King of Hell,

09:34.320 --> 09:36.766
asks you to do something? You do it.

09:37.320 --> 09:38.970
- Whatever.
- "Whatever?"

09:39.520 --> 09:41.204
What, are you a 14-year-old girl now?

09:41.480 --> 09:43.642
I mean, not right now.

09:44.040 --> 09:47.169
I possessed one once,
but it didn't work out.

09:47.680 --> 09:52.163
Lot of feelings, and urges,
and ugly, snot-crying

09:52.360 --> 09:55.967
about how Julie's with Craig Castle now
even though he's total bae,

09:56.280 --> 09:59.045
but she's, like, a busted bitch on ice.

10:04.360 --> 10:06.169
- Hormones, dude.
- Whatever.

10:06.440 --> 10:09.728
Let's clean this up,
then we go meet the Man.

10:16.520 --> 10:19.364
TONI: I know darling,
but Mummy will be home soon.

10:23.400 --> 10:27.325
I miss you too. I love you so, so much.

10:50.320 --> 10:51.321
Be a good boy.

10:54.680 --> 10:55.681
You.

11:01.840 --> 11:03.490
Now, Sam...

11:07.760 --> 11:08.761
Let's begin.

11:15.880 --> 11:17.848
SAM: Toni Bevell.
London Chapterhouse.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.126
That's right.

11:19.560 --> 11:22.643
So you're what?
You're English Men of Letters?

11:22.800 --> 11:24.040
British.

11:27.040 --> 11:28.041
Where are we?

11:28.560 --> 11:29.721
Does it matter?

11:30.280 --> 11:33.170
Just wondering how far I'mma have to walk
back to town after I kill you.

11:33.440 --> 11:34.441
And her.

11:36.480 --> 11:37.481
But you first.

11:38.800 --> 11:42.282
Yes, well, before you murder us all,
we do have a few questions.

11:42.440 --> 11:45.250
About you, your brother,
Hunters in America,

11:45.520 --> 11:47.204
and how you saved the sun.

11:50.480 --> 11:53.211
Right, you shoot me, kidnap me,

11:53.400 --> 11:55.243
but, yeah, happy to help.

11:55.480 --> 11:57.562
I didn't want to hurt you, Sam,
you gave me no choice.

11:58.120 --> 12:01.010
And... Well, I could say
it was never supposed to go this way,

12:01.160 --> 12:04.767
but you're you.
It was always going to go this way.

12:04.920 --> 12:06.126
And you know me?

12:06.280 --> 12:09.568
We do. We've been watching you,
and your brother, for years.

12:09.920 --> 12:12.571
Ever since you almost ended the world
the first time.

12:13.280 --> 12:15.408
We knew all about Lucifer,
the angels falling...

12:15.560 --> 12:16.846
Then where were you?

12:17.720 --> 12:19.210
Fair question.

12:19.440 --> 12:22.603
See, some of us wanted to get involved,
but the old men wouldn't allow it.

12:22.800 --> 12:24.689
Thought we were overstepping our bounds.

12:25.280 --> 12:27.328
After all this business with The Darkness,

12:27.960 --> 12:31.328
even they have to agree,
things need to change.

12:32.240 --> 12:34.766
And while you might not believe this, Sam,

12:35.280 --> 12:36.850
we're here to help.

12:38.400 --> 12:40.607
Yeah, no, I can tell.

12:40.840 --> 12:42.330
<i>I won't apologize for locking you up.</i>

12:42.480 --> 12:44.642
You're dangerous, to others, and yourself.

12:44.800 --> 12:48.407
But, if you answer my questions,
you'll walk right out that door.

12:48.960 --> 12:49.961
I promise.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.644
- Pass.
- Sam...

12:54.800 --> 12:56.450
<i>You can ask me
any kind of question you want,</i>

12:57.240 --> 13:00.881
but the answer's gonna be
the exact same, "Screw you."

13:02.360 --> 13:05.523
<i>You wanna get mad?
You wanna get mean?</i>

13:06.320 --> 13:08.527
I've been tortured by the Devil himself.

13:09.440 --> 13:12.649
So, you?
You're just an accent in a pantsuit.

13:13.760 --> 13:14.807
What can you do to me?

13:33.240 --> 13:36.244
A cold shower? That's your play?

14:00.560 --> 14:02.085
Screw you.

14:14.800 --> 14:15.926
You live here?

14:16.440 --> 14:20.161
Yeah, when we're not on the road.
It's an old Men of Letters bunker.

14:20.800 --> 14:22.086
- "Men of Letters?"
- Yeah.

14:22.760 --> 14:25.843
They're a myth. An old Hunter's story.

14:26.200 --> 14:29.409
DEAN: Not so much.
New duds look good.

14:30.120 --> 14:33.886
Well, thanks. It's better
than walking around in that nightgown.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.041
Rest...

14:46.200 --> 14:47.406
That's blood.

14:48.640 --> 14:49.687
Yeah.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.765
Sammy?

15:03.920 --> 15:04.921
Cass?

15:29.080 --> 15:30.081
Take this.

15:31.920 --> 15:33.206
Stay here.

15:34.800 --> 15:35.801
Dean?

15:36.960 --> 15:38.121
Sammy?

16:29.080 --> 16:30.570
Hands in the air, get on your knees.

16:30.840 --> 16:32.888
Who are you? And where is Sam?

16:33.040 --> 16:34.326
Hands. Now.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.050
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:36.240 --> 16:39.005
It's okay. It's okay.
He's a friend. All right?

16:40.080 --> 16:41.206
- Hey, Cass.
- Dean.

16:41.360 --> 16:42.964
Hey, okay. All right.

16:44.720 --> 16:46.085
Dean, you're alive?

16:46.240 --> 16:47.241
Yeah.

16:47.520 --> 16:49.761
What about the bomb and The Darkness?
What happened?

16:49.920 --> 16:51.445
I'll tell you everything.
Where is Sam?

16:51.600 --> 16:52.840
He's not here?

16:54.120 --> 16:55.121
Are you a Hunter?

16:55.320 --> 16:56.446
- No, I'm an angel.
- He's an angel.

16:56.600 --> 16:57.681
- Come again?
- An angel.

16:57.840 --> 17:00.605
With a capital A.
You know, wings. Harp...

17:00.840 --> 17:02.080
No, I don't have a harp.

17:03.440 --> 17:04.521
This is Castiel.

17:06.920 --> 17:09.445
Cass, this is Mary

17:10.240 --> 17:11.241
Winchester.

17:14.960 --> 17:15.961
Your mother.

17:16.119 --> 17:18.361
Yeah. So, wait. Where, where is Sam?

17:18.560 --> 17:20.289
He's not answering his phone,
there's blood on the floor,

17:20.440 --> 17:21.441
- what's going on?
- I don't know.

17:21.640 --> 17:23.290
We came back here,
there was a woman waiting for us.

17:23.440 --> 17:25.488
She blasted me away.
I don't know who she was,

17:25.640 --> 17:26.971
I don't know what happened to Sam.

17:27.119 --> 17:28.166
I don't understand. What happened?

17:28.319 --> 17:30.527
Okay, well, the bunker's empty,
so, they've obviously left here.

17:30.680 --> 17:33.331
You said "woman," not an angel,
not a demon, a human.

17:33.480 --> 17:34.481
She was human.

17:36.120 --> 17:37.326
When did this go down?

17:38.040 --> 17:39.769
It was 2:12 a.m.

17:43.680 --> 17:46.160
Is that a computer?

17:46.880 --> 17:49.087
Yes. I don't trust them.

18:00.400 --> 18:01.731
Got somethin'.

18:02.320 --> 18:05.529
An SUV ran a red light
a few blocks from here at 2:21 a.m.

18:05.680 --> 18:07.603
Then there wasn't another car
for 40 minutes.

18:07.840 --> 18:09.080
How did you do that?

18:09.280 --> 18:10.691
I hacked the traffic cams.

18:13.560 --> 18:14.721
Welcome to the future.

18:14.960 --> 18:16.007
You think it's them?

18:16.600 --> 18:17.726
It's worth a shot.

18:31.320 --> 18:32.367
Mom?

18:34.920 --> 18:35.921
Oh...

18:44.640 --> 18:46.290
This was John's car.

18:47.600 --> 18:49.967
Oh, she's still beautiful.

18:50.240 --> 18:51.730
Hell yeah, she is.

18:55.760 --> 18:58.001
Hi, sweetheart.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.411
Remember me?

19:20.560 --> 19:21.561
Oh...

19:34.360 --> 19:35.407
We should go.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.642
Can we end this, Sam? Please?

19:54.120 --> 19:56.691
Screw. You.

19:58.440 --> 20:00.602
What do you imagine is happening here?

20:01.320 --> 20:02.845
Do you think you're being brave?

20:03.160 --> 20:05.208
That you're the hero of this story?

20:07.320 --> 20:10.767
Well, you're no hero,
Sam, you're just bad at your job.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.291
Yeah, and you're better?

20:12.480 --> 20:14.084
So much better.

20:16.640 --> 20:20.964
You drive backroads,
catching cases at random.

20:21.120 --> 20:22.610
You get word a body's dropped,
you check it out,

20:22.760 --> 20:25.161
and maybe you even kill the thing
that did it.

20:26.120 --> 20:29.761
But that person is still dead,
and maybe a few more.

20:31.320 --> 20:33.800
But my people? We plan ahead.

20:34.360 --> 20:37.887
<i>We study lore,
and we use it against our enemies.</i>

20:38.160 --> 20:40.367
<i>Back home, every thoroughfare,
every bridge, every dock,</i>

20:40.520 --> 20:42.045
<i>every airport has been warded.</i>

20:42.200 --> 20:44.282
<i>The moment
a monster steps foot in Britain,</i>

20:44.760 --> 20:48.003
<i>we know about it.
Within 20 minutes, he's been picked up.</i>

20:54.360 --> 20:57.489
<i>And within 40, he's dead.</i>

21:01.160 --> 21:04.209
<i>There hasn't been a monster-related death
in Britain since 1965.</i>

21:04.360 --> 21:07.091
<i>Because we are good at our job.</i>

21:13.080 --> 21:15.162
I know you were always a lost cause, Sam,

21:15.320 --> 21:17.926
but I'm hoping there are other Hunters
we can work with.

21:18.880 --> 21:19.881
Teach.

21:21.360 --> 21:25.524
So... I need you to give me names.

21:26.520 --> 21:30.241
And locations and everything else.

21:30.400 --> 21:35.088
Dead drops, meeting places,
an organizational hierarchy.

21:35.240 --> 21:38.403
Because, maybe,
with all of us working together,

21:38.600 --> 21:40.443
<i>we can do what you never could.</i>

21:41.960 --> 21:44.884
Make America safe.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.283
Or maybe you tie 'em to a chair.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.171
Maybe you do worse.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.890
So maybe...

21:58.160 --> 21:59.730
Maybe you can go to Hell.

22:03.600 --> 22:04.601
<i>Hmm.</i>

22:05.920 --> 22:07.410
Have it your way.

22:38.720 --> 22:40.529
Are you really gonna make me do this?

22:47.760 --> 22:49.922
Screw you.

23:06.880 --> 23:09.486
No. No. Don't...

23:12.400 --> 23:13.401
Don't...

23:26.640 --> 23:29.041
So, so gross.

23:30.280 --> 23:32.760
I thought he was supposed to meet us.

23:33.800 --> 23:36.280
What? Yes.

23:36.440 --> 23:39.125
No. I... Of course, my liege.

23:39.840 --> 23:43.049
We... We're here, but, but where's...

23:44.440 --> 23:45.566
What's he saying?

23:45.720 --> 23:48.166
He won't tell me where he is.
He thinks we're being followed.

23:48.520 --> 23:51.364
Come on, there's no way
we're being followed.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.331
Hello, boys.

23:58.320 --> 24:01.961
Lucifer, uh, I have to go.

24:03.160 --> 24:05.003
Still betting that horse, are we?

24:05.200 --> 24:07.282
Yeah, 'cause we're not stupid.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.490
Keep telling yourself that, dear.

24:11.760 --> 24:15.207
That dustup with the Darkness must have
really taken it out of the old boy.

24:15.360 --> 24:18.284
That's why he's jumping
from vessel to vessel to vessel.

24:18.960 --> 24:21.406
It's why Lucifer's running,
because he's weak.

24:21.600 --> 24:26.049
So? He'll get stronger.
Lucifer will lead us to glory.

24:26.200 --> 24:29.090
As long as he's out there,
Hell will never follow you.

24:30.720 --> 24:33.007
Well, like they say, duh.

24:33.560 --> 24:34.971
But, when I kill the Devil...

24:38.240 --> 24:39.685
You're his dog.

24:40.080 --> 24:42.651
Even powered down,
he could kick your Posh Spice ass.

24:49.280 --> 24:50.850
Who's laughing now?

24:55.520 --> 24:56.521
Hmm.

24:59.160 --> 25:00.571
Eeny,

25:04.920 --> 25:05.921
meeny,

25:08.880 --> 25:09.881
miny,

25:12.920 --> 25:13.921
moe.

25:18.280 --> 25:19.611
CASTIEL: Jamie Ross?

25:23.520 --> 25:24.601
Who's asking?

25:25.240 --> 25:27.971
The blonde woman that you drove yesterday,
what was her name?

25:28.280 --> 25:31.170
"Blonde?" Sorry, mate.
You got the wrong...

25:32.440 --> 25:33.521
Cass.

25:34.480 --> 25:35.527
That's an angel?

25:36.800 --> 25:38.768
Blonde. Name. Now.

25:38.920 --> 25:40.285
I don't know her name.

25:41.360 --> 25:42.361
What do you know?

25:57.320 --> 26:00.483
MS. WATT: <i>No one can take
that much pain and not break.</i>

26:00.640 --> 26:01.721
<i>No one.</i>

26:04.160 --> 26:05.321
What are you saying?

26:05.640 --> 26:07.051
I...

26:07.200 --> 26:12.161
Ma'am, if you want him dead,
then I'll slit his throat right now.

26:12.680 --> 26:16.048
But if you want to take this
to the next level,

26:16.400 --> 26:18.004
you need to make the call.

26:19.160 --> 26:20.491
Bring in Mr. Ketch.

26:23.960 --> 26:26.201
I don't want that psychopath
anywhere near me.

26:29.200 --> 26:30.565
So...

26:31.120 --> 26:32.406
TONI: So,

26:34.120 --> 26:36.361
we stop trying to break his body.

26:39.800 --> 26:41.131
We break his mind.

27:09.640 --> 27:10.801
Thank you.

27:20.280 --> 27:22.726
This must be difficult for you.

27:24.840 --> 27:26.763
<i>I remember my first moments on Earth.</i>

27:27.760 --> 27:28.886
It was jarring.

27:31.080 --> 27:32.411
One word for it.

27:34.480 --> 27:35.845
I grew up with Hunters.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.480
I've heard of people
coming back from the dead before.

27:40.240 --> 27:44.131
But actually do it, after 30 years?

27:46.360 --> 27:47.646
A lot's changed.

27:51.840 --> 27:52.841
A lot.

27:54.280 --> 27:55.361
- You find anything?
- Yeah,

27:55.520 --> 27:58.091
I ran the tail number
that what's-his-face gave us.

27:58.280 --> 28:01.682
The plane that Evil Elsa flew in on
has diplomatic registry.

28:03.080 --> 28:05.560
- Which means?
- Which means its flight plans are sealed,

28:06.080 --> 28:07.445
unless you wanna hack
the State Department.

28:08.080 --> 28:09.366
Who are these people?

28:12.080 --> 28:13.127
Dean.

28:34.280 --> 28:36.123
Dr. Marion. How 'bout you let us in?

28:38.240 --> 28:40.891
So you dug the bullet out of his leg,
no questions asked?

28:41.040 --> 28:43.520
She offered me 100 grand.

28:43.920 --> 28:44.921
And you took it?

28:47.160 --> 28:48.810
Student loans are a bitch. Okay?

28:49.760 --> 28:51.489
Come on, Cass. Cass, Cass.

28:51.760 --> 28:53.444
Don't hurt him. Not yet.

28:54.360 --> 28:56.442
All right, look,
she didn't give me her name.

28:56.600 --> 28:59.604
When we were done,
the driver bailed, I got paid,

28:59.800 --> 29:02.485
and then some other chick shows up
and they all drive away.

29:03.720 --> 29:06.007
And that's everything you know?

29:07.160 --> 29:08.161
Yeah.

29:09.600 --> 29:10.601
Totally.

29:13.560 --> 29:14.686
Hurt him.

29:16.400 --> 29:18.926
I have her phone number. Okay?
Okay, look, look, look.

29:19.160 --> 29:21.208
I don't know where they are
but she called me a couple hours ago,

29:21.440 --> 29:24.046
<i>a few hours ago, asking about
the sedative I gave the guy.</i>

29:24.360 --> 29:27.204
So, I've got her phone number.

30:23.280 --> 30:24.930
- I don't think it's working.
- Wait.

30:26.600 --> 30:28.921
Soon, he'll be begging
to answer our questions.

30:29.400 --> 30:31.289
Anything to make it stop.

30:37.040 --> 30:38.041
Dr. Marion?

30:38.200 --> 30:41.090
Yeah, I'm just calling, you know,
to check on the patient.

30:41.240 --> 30:42.844
Is everything all right, Doctor?

30:43.240 --> 30:44.969
Yep, yep, sure. Definitely.

30:45.800 --> 30:46.801
I'm hanging up now.

30:46.960 --> 30:47.961
No, wait...

30:48.120 --> 30:50.361
Listen, bitch, I don't care who you are,

30:50.520 --> 30:53.285
I don't care what you want,
you have my brother.

30:55.400 --> 30:57.084
Dean Winchester,

30:57.720 --> 31:00.200
- I heard you were dead.
- Well, you <i>heard</i> wrong.

31:00.480 --> 31:04.041
I'm gonna give you one chance,
just one, to hand Sam back...

31:04.200 --> 31:05.964
Sorry. Not possible.

31:06.360 --> 31:08.727
<i>Oh, you think you can run from me?
Try it.</i>

31:09.240 --> 31:11.561
Because when I find you,
and I will find you,

31:12.200 --> 31:15.090
if he is not in one piece.
I will take you apart.

31:15.800 --> 31:17.928
You understand me?

31:20.520 --> 31:21.646
We have a problem.

31:44.960 --> 31:47.486
Let me out!

32:23.560 --> 32:25.244
No!

32:37.960 --> 32:39.086
Now what?

32:39.480 --> 32:41.005
Well, we got her number.

32:41.160 --> 32:43.162
Let's head back to the bunker
and we'll put a trace on it.

32:54.280 --> 32:55.281
Mom?

32:56.360 --> 32:58.442
She's unconscious,
but there's no serious damage.

32:58.600 --> 32:59.886
All right, help her.

33:11.040 --> 33:14.681
Dean Winchester, I presume.

33:28.240 --> 33:29.571
No!

33:33.040 --> 33:34.041
Jessica.

33:42.120 --> 33:46.045
You should be more careful
with your location services on your phone.

33:46.920 --> 33:48.001
Are you one of 'em?

33:48.960 --> 33:50.200
I'm one of them.

33:50.600 --> 33:51.806
Yeah.

33:56.440 --> 33:59.444
You tell me where my brother is
and I might take it easy on you.

34:00.320 --> 34:01.970
No, please don't.

34:22.560 --> 34:24.449
MS. WATT: <i>Looking for this?</i>

34:32.560 --> 34:35.449
So, round two? Anyone?

34:39.280 --> 34:41.851
DEAN:
<i>Dead, dead, I'm dead because of you!</i>

34:42.040 --> 34:43.326
<i>This is all your fault!
This is your fault!</i>

34:43.480 --> 34:45.527
- Dean?
- <i>We're all dead because of you.</i>

34:45.679 --> 34:47.409
<i>We're all dead because of you, Sam.</i>

35:17.760 --> 35:20.001
DEAN: <i>It should have been you.
It should have been you.</i>

35:20.360 --> 35:24.445
<i>You're the freak. You are the freak.
You're the freak.</i>

35:26.280 --> 35:27.361
<i>It's your fault.</i>

35:27.680 --> 35:28.727
You're right.

35:32.520 --> 35:35.729
You know, I would have thought
for two strapping lads,

35:35.880 --> 35:38.884
like yourselves,
you would have lasted a tad longer.

35:39.560 --> 35:43.326
But, you know what they say.
Good things come to those...

35:54.360 --> 35:55.521
Thanks, Mom.

36:03.040 --> 36:05.611
DEAN: <i>Your fault! It's your fault.</i>

36:05.760 --> 36:09.242
<i>You must die! It's your fault.
It is your fault. Just die!</i>

36:14.040 --> 36:18.011
DEAN: <i>It's your fault!
It's all your fault. Just die.</i>

36:18.280 --> 36:20.408
<i>Why won't you die, Sam,
why won't you die?</i>

36:22.600 --> 36:23.761
<i>It's your fault.</i>

36:27.120 --> 36:28.121
No.

37:02.320 --> 37:05.324
Maybe you're not
as good at your job as you think.

37:35.160 --> 37:36.889
No! No!

37:38.240 --> 37:39.241
No!

37:40.640 --> 37:43.769
No! No!

38:27.040 --> 38:28.451
Found her cell phone in the car.

38:28.600 --> 38:30.762
Last phone call was made
from an Aldrich, Missouri.

38:31.800 --> 38:33.564
We're guessing
Sam's probably around there.

38:33.840 --> 38:36.446
Good. That's great.

38:37.280 --> 38:38.281
You Okay?

38:40.360 --> 38:41.691
No.

38:43.520 --> 38:45.522
I'm sorry, I just...

38:47.080 --> 38:51.051
I spent my life running from this,
from Hunting,

38:51.920 --> 38:53.251
and I got out.

38:54.120 --> 38:56.043
I never wanted this for you and Sam.

39:02.920 --> 39:06.003
Mom, I get it. I do.

39:07.400 --> 39:09.528
<i>If I had kids,
I wouldn't want them in this.</i>

39:10.000 --> 39:11.604
<i>But Sam and me?</i>

39:13.920 --> 39:16.924
Saving people and hunting things,
this is our life.

39:20.600 --> 39:23.604
I think we make the world a better place.
I know that we do.

39:42.120 --> 39:45.602
Witnesses say he was sweating
and pale and psycho.

39:46.440 --> 39:48.283
He said his name was freakin' Lucifer.
