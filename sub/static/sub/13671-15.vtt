00:01.040 --> 00:03.440
The board is conducting
a feasibility study

00:03.440 --> 00:07.000
to determine if St Eligius can
continue operating efficiently.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.480
What's
the alternatives?

00:08.480 --> 00:10.800
Tighten the budget
or close the doors.

00:10.800 --> 00:12.280
How are the memoirs?  Great.

00:12.280 --> 00:15.520
If you can shovel out trash
like this, we have a bestseller.

00:15.520 --> 00:19.080
Take this down. Her shapely legs
straddled my gurney.

00:19.080 --> 00:20.520
Boy, you've lost your mind.

00:20.520 --> 00:24.160
I'd like to discuss this further but
I have to get back to my book.

00:24.160 --> 00:27.360
Chapter 15.
"A tale of two cysts."

00:27.360 --> 00:28.800
Have you seen John Doe?

00:28.800 --> 00:31.440
That nitwit stole
333 of the best pages of my life.

00:31.440 --> 00:34.280
Now I know what those
stories in Cosmo wee about.

00:34.280 --> 00:35.720
You slept with
Westphall's daughter?

00:35.720 --> 00:39.720
You slept with
Westphall's daughter?

02:06.320 --> 02:09.000
(MAN'S THOUGHTS)
'These geezers are goners.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.960
'Never ran a kilometre
in their life.

02:10.960 --> 02:14.960
'Once it goes,
kiss it goodbye.

02:15.120 --> 02:18.000
'Boy, I can't wait to blow
this clam bar.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.920
'Hospital's no place for a healthy
person. Pick up a bug here

02:20.920 --> 02:24.920
'that would turn
your blood black.

02:25.280 --> 02:26.720
'Where's my Tums?

02:26.720 --> 02:29.040
'Burns all the way
to my fingertips.

02:29.040 --> 02:30.960
'Now I know what
the sizzle feels like

02:30.960 --> 02:33.920
'when they brand cows
in westerns.

02:33.920 --> 02:37.920
'Why can't I move
my left arm?

02:38.200 --> 02:42.000
'Can't breathe. Pinch.
Choke. Squeeze.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.360
'Need a haircut.

02:43.360 --> 02:45.440
'Got to shave the tops
of my ears.

02:45.440 --> 02:46.960
'Thing about getting older,

02:46.960 --> 02:50.960
'you have hair growing out of
the most disgusting places.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.880
'I wonder if Julia knows where
the safe deposit key is.

02:53.880 --> 02:55.200
'I'm sure she has no idea.

MONITOR BEEPS

03:01.240 --> 03:02.240
Morning, Elizabeth.

03:02.240 --> 03:03.200
Morning, Elizabeth.

03:03.200 --> 03:04.160
Morning, Elizabeth.

03:04.160 --> 03:06.360
Morning, Elizabeth.

03:06.360 --> 03:09.640
Did I initiate a conversation
with you?

03:09.640 --> 03:10.920
No, sir.

03:10.920 --> 03:14.000
I said wintergreen,
not cinnamon.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.640
How literate do you have to be to
sell mints, junior?

03:16.640 --> 03:20.640
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

03:20.840 --> 03:22.520
What are
you reading, Morrison?

03:22.520 --> 03:26.320
Oh, sorry. Have you looked at
this new bestseller?

03:26.320 --> 03:29.240
I don't have time
to read fiction.

03:29.240 --> 03:31.640
The Cutting Edge
by Dr C.

03:31.640 --> 03:34.040
It's sordid, perverse.
Pretty accurate, too.

03:34.040 --> 03:35.440
What do you mean?

03:35.440 --> 03:37.400
Sounds exactly
like St Eligius.

03:37.400 --> 03:39.800
The Chief of Services
has cancer.

03:39.800 --> 03:43.640
The Director of Medicine is seeing
this knockout first-year resident.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.480
Listen. "She fell lymph
into my arms."

03:46.480 --> 03:50.480
Let me see that.

03:51.120 --> 03:52.240
Doe!

03:52.240 --> 03:55.000
And plenty
of it. Â¤24.95.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
I'll take
one of these.

03:59.120 --> 04:02.640
I'd, uh...wait till
the paperback comes out.

04:02.640 --> 04:04.440
Get out of my way, dingle bat.

04:04.440 --> 04:08.440
I've got patients
to read... Er, see.

04:08.760 --> 04:12.000
(OVER PA) 'Nurse Orenstein
to Radiology.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.160
'Orenstein to Radiology.'

04:15.160 --> 04:17.360
Hi, stranger.

04:17.360 --> 04:18.440
Lizter.

04:18.440 --> 04:21.200
I thought you were
going to call me.

04:21.200 --> 04:23.840
I did. I wanted to take you to
the Oliver Twist awards.

04:23.840 --> 04:25.200
Didn't you
get my message?

04:25.200 --> 04:25.640
No.

04:25.640 --> 04:28.200
No.

04:28.200 --> 04:30.680
Look, even so,
before scooting in today,

04:30.680 --> 04:32.840
you should have
Graham-Belled me.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.600
I'm a doctor's daughter.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.520
I know not to tie up
your beeper.

04:36.520 --> 04:37.960
Yeah, that can be painful.

04:37.960 --> 04:40.360
But I'm not here
to see you.

04:40.360 --> 04:42.400
Oh, your father.

04:42.400 --> 04:43.800
No, not him, either.

04:43.800 --> 04:45.640
check-up. Fiscus.

04:45.640 --> 04:47.640
Oh. Anything wrong?
Feeling OK?

04:47.640 --> 04:49.400
Oh, sweet of you to ask.

04:49.400 --> 04:50.840
This is my floor.

04:50.840 --> 04:52.680
Hey, you're looking
awfully thin.

04:52.680 --> 04:55.080
You sound
like my mother.

04:55.080 --> 04:56.920
You could stand
a home-cooked meal.

04:56.920 --> 04:59.480
Are you free tonight?
Why not come over for dinner?

04:59.480 --> 05:02.040
Lizzie, I think
that's a good idea.

05:02.040 --> 05:04.280
I mean, Dr. Westphall and I...

05:04.280 --> 05:05.840
I know you've had your
hassles.

05:05.840 --> 05:08.440
This would give Dad a chance
to see you in a new light.

05:08.440 --> 05:09.840
Away from work.

05:09.840 --> 05:12.960
Please? It would
mean a lot to me.

05:12.960 --> 05:14.080
Great.

05:14.080 --> 05:16.360
Tommy's spending the night
at the Brimleys',

05:16.360 --> 05:18.800
so it will be
just be you, me, and Dad.

05:18.800 --> 05:19.840
Bye.

05:19.840 --> 05:22.320
I'll see you.

05:22.320 --> 05:26.320
Oh...

05:28.560 --> 05:30.480
Ok, if only I had a little
orange sauce...

05:30.480 --> 05:31.840
Ok, if only I had a little
orange sauce...

05:31.840 --> 05:35.040
After years of delivering Dippy's
Diapers, I've heard them all.

05:35.040 --> 05:36.120
Can I get down?

05:36.120 --> 05:39.000
Um, yes, just reach
under your wing and pull some out..

05:39.000 --> 05:41.320
I'd laugh, but
my gizzard's killing me.

05:41.320 --> 05:44.400
Well, let me
take a gander.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.760
Anytime I eat anything
stronger than milk,

05:46.760 --> 05:48.720
I get a terrible
burning pain here.

05:48.720 --> 05:50.440
Taking aspirin?

05:50.440 --> 05:51.880
No.  Arthritis medicine?

05:51.880 --> 05:53.040
No.

05:53.040 --> 05:55.200
You ever had an ulcer?

05:55.200 --> 05:56.680
Not me, but Dad did.

05:56.680 --> 06:00.680
OK, I'm going to order
a GI series for you.

06:00.720 --> 06:04.360
Well, now I've got something
to look forward to(!)

06:04.360 --> 06:05.800
I'd better call Dippy.

06:05.800 --> 06:08.680
cos when I get behind
in deliveries,

06:08.680 --> 06:12.680
he goes quackers.

06:17.720 --> 06:19.360
Gone before
we got to him.

06:19.360 --> 06:21.720
Send Mr Belvedere
to the morgue.

06:21.720 --> 06:25.720
Right.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.280

06:31.280 --> 06:34.880
DOOR OPENS

06:34.880 --> 06:36.880
What do you think?

06:36.880 --> 06:40.520
You're too late for Halloween.
Been rummaging around in your attic?

06:40.520 --> 06:42.160
One of my
favourite chapeaux.

06:42.160 --> 06:43.680
1941.

06:43.680 --> 06:45.800
A stylish brim.

06:45.800 --> 06:47.840
I favour the MacArthur
tilt myself.

06:47.840 --> 06:50.880
The general always
affects a jaunty rake.

06:50.880 --> 06:54.160
Can't you see
I'm reading?

06:54.160 --> 06:55.240
Ah, the Cutting Edge.

06:55.240 --> 06:58.040
Katharine just borrowed that book
from the Havenhursts.

06:58.040 --> 06:59.760
It's nestled now
on my nightstand.

06:59.760 --> 07:01.200
What do you think?

07:01.200 --> 07:05.200
Gripping. Especially the chapter on
the cancer-ridden Chief of Services'

07:05.320 --> 07:07.440
gallant struggle
in the face of death.

07:07.440 --> 07:08.960
Overwritten.

07:08.960 --> 07:11.160
Did you barge in here
for a reason

07:11.160 --> 07:12.960
or just to do
a book review?

07:12.960 --> 07:14.400
Board of Trustees meeting.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.120
It's imperative
you attend.

07:16.120 --> 07:18.280
We need another
strong voice

07:18.280 --> 07:20.600
to shut down
the sycophants.

07:20.600 --> 07:23.480
The board commissioned
an independent feasibility study,

07:23.480 --> 07:24.560
and I got a sneak peek.

07:24.560 --> 07:27.480
I smell trouble.

07:27.480 --> 07:30.040
These mints are useless.
What time?

07:30.040 --> 07:32.040
Tomorrow, six o'clock.

07:32.040 --> 07:34.000
See you later,
alligator.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.280
Well, come on now, it's your turn.
In a while...

07:37.280 --> 07:39.000
Will you get out of here?

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
We'll never win the war
with that kind of spirit.

07:44.680 --> 07:46.720
"Tulips on the organ."

07:46.720 --> 07:48.600
My words.

07:48.600 --> 07:49.920
My book!

07:49.920 --> 07:51.400
Doe stole my book.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.160
I'll kill him.

07:53.160 --> 07:57.160
SMASHING

08:02.720 --> 08:06.240
Oh, for the love of Lorca.

08:06.240 --> 08:09.400
The other night, we're having
dinner at that little,

08:09.400 --> 08:12.680
Indian restaurant on
Vermont - Bleeding Madras.

08:12.680 --> 08:16.280
Bill orders the chicken vindaloo. I
said, "Go ahead, It's your funeral."

08:16.280 --> 08:17.920
Mother, please.

08:17.920 --> 08:21.600
After the curry, he's gulping
like a fish out of water.

08:21.600 --> 08:24.600
By the time we got here,
he was fine.

08:24.600 --> 08:25.800
Strange.

08:25.800 --> 08:29.800
He had no history of
cardiovascular disease?

08:30.040 --> 08:31.440
Nothing more
than heartburn.

08:31.440 --> 08:35.440
Nothing more
than heartburn.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.320
Mrs Belvedere, um...

08:39.320 --> 08:41.919
whenever a patient
dies unexpectedly

08:41.919 --> 08:45.080
within the first
24 hours after admission,

08:45.080 --> 08:48.760
it's customary...
We're required by law...

08:48.760 --> 08:50.240
Well...

08:50.240 --> 08:53.240
Well, I'd like
to do an autopsy

08:53.240 --> 08:54.440
to see what happened

08:54.440 --> 08:58.440
and, um, see if there's any
underlying cardiovascular disease.

08:59.680 --> 09:03.680
Biff?
Maryanne?

09:04.040 --> 09:05.480
I'd like to know.

09:05.480 --> 09:06.640
Me, too.

09:06.640 --> 09:09.240
Me, too.

09:09.240 --> 09:13.240
Well, an autopsy doesn't
preclude viewing at all.

09:13.440 --> 09:15.760
We're very careful
to restore the...

09:15.760 --> 09:19.760
patient to his or her
original state.

09:21.040 --> 09:23.920
You go ahead with
your autopsy, Dr Novino.

09:23.920 --> 09:26.160
I think we'll have a...

09:26.160 --> 09:30.160
closed casket.

09:33.120 --> 09:35.960
Have you read this?

09:35.960 --> 09:37.600
Yeah. When I was
home convalescing.

09:37.600 --> 09:38.640
Yeah. When I was
home convalescing.

09:38.640 --> 09:41.680
Yeah. When I was
home convalescing.

09:41.680 --> 09:45.680
Why do Asian women always have to be
portrayed like geishas or Suzy Wong?

09:46.480 --> 09:47.880
Dr Westphall.

09:47.880 --> 09:48.880
Yeah?

09:48.880 --> 09:50.760
Yeah?

09:50.760 --> 09:52.200
In private?

09:52.200 --> 09:56.080
Sure. Come on.

09:56.080 --> 10:00.080
Go ahead, Fiscus.
I'm listening.

10:01.320 --> 10:04.360
Well, sir...

10:04.360 --> 10:06.280
this is kind of
complicated.

10:06.280 --> 10:08.960
It's about doctor-patient
confidentiality.

10:08.960 --> 10:10.160
Ah.

10:10.160 --> 10:14.160
Should we be having
this conversation?

10:16.680 --> 10:20.480
I've got a patient, who I'll call
"A," with complications,

10:20.480 --> 10:23.880
and also a relationship with a
member of this patient's family,

10:23.880 --> 10:25.280
who I'll call "B".

10:25.280 --> 10:28.320
Now I know that "B" would want
to know what I know about "A."

10:28.320 --> 10:30.720
Now, does your patient want the
family member to know?

10:30.720 --> 10:32.680
Now, does your patient want the
family member to know?

10:32.680 --> 10:35.000
I think your job is to convince "A"
to tell "B".

10:35.000 --> 10:36.320
I tried.

10:36.320 --> 10:38.440
I think that "B"
would be angry at me

10:38.440 --> 10:40.680
for withholding the information.

10:40.680 --> 10:42.440
Ah, well, that puts
you up against

10:42.440 --> 10:44.800
the classic ethical
question, doesn't it?

10:44.800 --> 10:47.320
In other words, you can
do right by "B",

10:47.320 --> 10:50.720
but then you risk
losing "A's" trust.

10:50.720 --> 10:52.000
I see.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.440
Well, thank you
for your help.

10:54.440 --> 10:57.280
Is there something you're not
telling me about this case?

10:57.280 --> 10:58.920
Your daughter Lizzie?

10:58.920 --> 11:00.600
What about her?

11:00.600 --> 11:04.600
She's pregnant.

11:13.320 --> 11:16.200
Look at the size
of this liver. Riddled with tumours.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.600
What can I do you for?

11:18.600 --> 11:21.200
I need to autopsy
a patient, Dr Bedder.

11:21.200 --> 11:23.400
Whose viscera are
you vivisecting?

11:23.400 --> 11:24.440
Bill Belvedere.

11:24.440 --> 11:28.400
Belvedere. Right. Massive MI
arrived COD a couple hours ago.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.840
So what tray's he on?
I need to get started.

11:30.840 --> 11:31.920
Can this wait?

11:31.920 --> 11:34.640
I'm swamped right now.
People dying who haven't before.

11:34.640 --> 11:37.080
Don't worry,
I'll stay out of your way.

11:37.080 --> 11:39.440
What's the point?
I see this all the time.

11:39.440 --> 11:41.000
The guy had a faulty clock,

11:41.000 --> 11:44.480
stuffs himself with
guacamole and chips,

11:44.480 --> 11:47.160
shook his saltshaker, fried his fat.
Where's the mystery?

11:47.160 --> 11:50.000
shook his saltshaker, fried his fat.
Where's the mystery?

11:50.000 --> 11:52.560
of a heart attack.
His family wants to know why.

11:52.560 --> 11:54.480
What's the rush?

11:54.480 --> 11:57.160
They want to get the remains
to the funeral home.

11:57.160 --> 11:59.880
I need to perform this autopsy

11:59.880 --> 12:02.600
right now. What do I need to do?
Get a court order?!

12:02.600 --> 12:06.600
Come on, Dr Bedder.
Let's go.

12:15.600 --> 12:19.080
"Belvedere, Bill."

12:19.080 --> 12:23.080
Thank you.

12:33.280 --> 12:35.400
Bedder.

12:35.400 --> 12:36.680
Bedder.

12:36.680 --> 12:38.080
Hey!

12:38.080 --> 12:39.200
What?

12:39.200 --> 12:43.200
(SIGHS) Where's his head?

12:58.080 --> 12:59.000
Hello, dear.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.040
Hello, dear.

13:02.040 --> 13:06.040
Dr Arrowsmith. Just visited a
patient of mine, Debbie Hoffman.

13:06.120 --> 13:08.000
Are you on staff here?

13:08.000 --> 13:09.440
God forbid, no.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.280
I'm her family's private
physician.

13:11.280 --> 13:14.240
I'm looking for the young man
who admitted and treated her -

13:14.240 --> 13:15.800
Dr Chandler.

13:15.800 --> 13:17.760
Last time I saw him,

13:17.760 --> 13:19.680
he was headed
toward on-call.

13:19.680 --> 13:22.560
May I ask you
a personal question?

13:22.560 --> 13:24.080
Where did you get
that lovely sweater?

13:24.080 --> 13:26.880
Where did you get
that lovely sweater?

13:26.880 --> 13:28.800
Maybe I'll
surprise my wife.

13:28.800 --> 13:31.360
I rarely get to this section of
town. Thank you, dear.

13:31.360 --> 13:33.480
Rosenthal. Nurse Rosenthal.

13:33.480 --> 13:37.480
On-call, huh?

13:42.680 --> 13:44.120
Excuse me.

13:44.120 --> 13:45.400
Yeah?

13:45.400 --> 13:47.160
Dr Chandler?

13:47.160 --> 13:48.840
Mm-hmm.

13:48.840 --> 13:50.560
Dr Arrowsmith.

13:50.560 --> 13:52.760
I'm the Johnson
family physician.

13:52.760 --> 13:54.200
So?

13:54.200 --> 13:57.080
You're treating the granddaughter,
Debbie Hoffman.

13:57.080 --> 13:58.520
Yeah. Yeah. That's right.

13:58.520 --> 14:01.320
Well, at her mother's request,
I took a peek.

14:01.320 --> 14:04.280
And, frankly, I'm alarmed
at your treatment,

14:04.280 --> 14:05.800
which seems
casual at best.

14:05.800 --> 14:08.040
According to the latest
journal reports,

14:08.040 --> 14:12.000
most ulcers can be successfully
treated with cimetidine.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.120
A mailbox full of glossy
subscriptions

14:14.120 --> 14:16.280
doesn't make up for
years of experience.

14:16.280 --> 14:19.080
Perhaps you don't know
everything about this case.

14:19.080 --> 14:20.320
Look, Dr Arrowsmith,

14:20.320 --> 14:23.680
I understand you used to put
patients on restricted diets,

14:23.680 --> 14:25.600
magnesia-alumina suspension,

14:25.600 --> 14:29.200
but time has proven most of these
remedies make people worse.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.120
You must be a first-year intern.

14:31.120 --> 14:34.000
Overeager to use
the latest procedure.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.440
Impress higher-ups.

14:35.440 --> 14:39.040
I'm in my third year and frankly
I've seen a lot of you old guys

14:39.040 --> 14:41.800
with your private practices
sitting on your behind

14:41.800 --> 14:43.840
in the 'burbs,
getting soft and lazy

14:43.840 --> 14:46.440
on out-of-date information
and techniques,

14:46.440 --> 14:48.840
giving the rest of us
a bad name.

14:48.840 --> 14:51.160
Who's your supervisor?

14:51.160 --> 14:54.560
(SIGHS) If you'll excuse me,
I got to get some sleep.

14:54.560 --> 14:58.560
I've been on duty
for 36 hours.

15:03.120 --> 15:07.120
You work fast. Mr Belvedere
couldn't even have been cold yet.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.280
The race is
to the swift.

15:09.280 --> 15:11.440
Time, essence,
freshness.

15:11.440 --> 15:14.200
The market
is very particular,

15:14.200 --> 15:15.720
and the margins
are thin.

15:15.720 --> 15:16.840
Just heads?

15:16.840 --> 15:18.400
Oh, no. An assortment.

15:18.400 --> 15:20.280
Arms, feet, organs.

15:20.280 --> 15:21.400
For transplant?

15:21.400 --> 15:23.360
We now have
the technology,

15:23.360 --> 15:25.440
so a whole black market
is springing up.

15:25.440 --> 15:28.200
Where do you
sell these...parts?

15:28.200 --> 15:30.080
Research facilities,
med schools.

15:30.080 --> 15:33.320
The lesser-known places
have trouble getting enough bodies.

15:33.320 --> 15:36.520
Do you know how many medical students
there are now?

15:36.520 --> 15:39.720
The numbers are staggering. They need
corpses to practise on.

15:39.720 --> 15:41.560
Nothing wrong
with what I'm doing.

15:41.560 --> 15:42.960
Bull!

15:42.960 --> 15:46.320
Who's to know? They're dead.
They don't need them.

15:46.320 --> 15:50.320
Besides, I normally use indigents,
people with no families.

15:52.800 --> 15:55.040
I made a mistake
this time.

15:55.040 --> 15:56.960
I want
Mr Belvedere's head

15:56.960 --> 15:59.880
returned to his body
right now.

15:59.880 --> 16:00.880
You're not going to blow
the whistle, are you?

16:00.880 --> 16:02.400
You're not going to blow
the whistle, are you?

16:02.400 --> 16:05.120
I'll make a deal. Belvedere's
cabeza goes on his cadaver

16:05.120 --> 16:06.320
and we forget everything.

16:06.320 --> 16:08.480
and we forget everything.

16:08.480 --> 16:11.360
Bring me the head
of Bill Belvedere!

16:11.360 --> 16:15.360
Oh, you know... Oh, OK!

16:21.600 --> 16:24.480
No.

16:24.480 --> 16:27.160
No.

16:27.160 --> 16:28.600
Mrs Dusenberg?

16:28.600 --> 16:31.960
What the...?!

16:31.960 --> 16:35.960
You don't have it?

16:35.960 --> 16:37.440
Where is his head?!

16:37.440 --> 16:38.880
I have no idea.

16:38.880 --> 16:40.400
How could this happen?

16:40.400 --> 16:42.040
Beats me.

16:42.040 --> 16:43.520
Unless...

16:43.520 --> 16:44.880
Unless?

16:44.880 --> 16:48.880
Unless somebody
threw it away.

16:51.200 --> 16:52.720
KNOCKING

16:52.720 --> 16:56.400
It's open.

16:56.400 --> 16:57.360
Dr Griffin.

16:57.360 --> 17:01.160
Dr Griffin.

17:01.160 --> 17:03.520
I brought a bottle
of Chateau Palmer.

17:03.520 --> 17:06.040
Oh, thanks a lot, but all I know
about wine

17:06.040 --> 17:10.040
is red is red
and white is white.

17:14.319 --> 17:15.440
This is a nice place.

17:15.440 --> 17:16.079
This is a nice place.

17:16.079 --> 17:18.040
This is a nice place.

17:18.040 --> 17:22.040
20... A little over
20 years.

17:22.280 --> 17:26.280
Sit down.

17:32.160 --> 17:33.600
Where's Liz?

17:33.600 --> 17:35.080
Upstairs changing.

17:35.080 --> 17:37.560
Well, is there
anything I can do? I mean...

17:37.560 --> 17:39.840
No. I think
you've done enough.

17:39.840 --> 17:40.960
I'm sorry?

17:40.960 --> 17:42.080
Um, bringing the wine.

17:42.080 --> 17:44.800
Oh. Yeah, sure,
no problem.

17:44.800 --> 17:46.240
Hi, Seth.

17:46.240 --> 17:47.320
Hi.

17:47.320 --> 17:50.120
Did Dad
offer a drink?

17:50.120 --> 17:52.320
No.

17:52.320 --> 17:54.560
You've got to keep
stirring the stew.

17:54.560 --> 17:58.000
Mm-hm.
Would you like one?

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
No, thanks.
I don't drink.

18:16.080 --> 18:20.080
I know why they
call this goofy glue.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.520
Cos it
makes you goofy.

18:22.520 --> 18:24.120
OK. Barbara's asleep.

18:24.120 --> 18:25.560
I'm next.

18:25.560 --> 18:27.000
What are you watching?

18:27.000 --> 18:28.120
Rob Weller.

18:28.120 --> 18:30.360
My kind of guy -
intelligent, funny...

18:30.360 --> 18:31.320
Short.

18:31.320 --> 18:32.760
Short.

18:32.760 --> 18:35.200
or I'll switch this
with your Pepsodent.

18:35.200 --> 18:38.120
'Our special guest is that medical
man of mystery - Dr C...'

18:38.120 --> 18:40.240
Shh. Look. It's him.

18:40.240 --> 18:42.440
Turn up the TV.

18:42.440 --> 18:46.440
'Doctor, I find your book similar
in tone to House Of God.

18:47.680 --> 18:49.880
'I missed that one.
I was elsewhere.

18:49.880 --> 18:52.200
'Otherwise engaged, eh?

18:52.200 --> 18:55.400
'Now, you will not reveal your true
identity because...'

18:55.400 --> 18:56.720
For crying out loud, Rob.

18:56.720 --> 18:59.040
Because
he stole the book!

18:59.040 --> 19:00.080
What book?

19:00.080 --> 19:01.520
My book!

19:01.520 --> 19:02.960
The memoirs.

19:02.960 --> 19:04.080
That's John Doe.

19:04.080 --> 19:05.480
'Why put doctors on...'

19:05.480 --> 19:06.840
Where?

19:06.840 --> 19:10.240
Oh, boy, you need a stronger
prescription. There!

19:10.240 --> 19:12.080
'I want to keep private life
private.

19:12.080 --> 19:14.920
'And yet tomorrow,
you were going to be in Boston

19:14.920 --> 19:16.480
'at a book-signing party.

19:16.480 --> 19:18.640
'I'm more than willing
to make public appearances.

19:18.640 --> 19:22.360
'I'm more than willing
to make public appearances.

19:22.360 --> 19:26.000
There's nothing
oxy about it!

19:26.000 --> 19:27.920
Ellen, I swear
on these hands,

19:27.920 --> 19:29.840
I will
find that worm,

19:29.840 --> 19:33.840
expose his rotten underbelly,
and get my masterpiece back!

19:42.440 --> 19:44.320
You haven't
touched dinner, Dad..

19:44.320 --> 19:46.000
Lost my appetite.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.200
Tastes great.
What do you call it?

19:48.200 --> 19:50.480
Mrs Erwin's stew.
You want some more?

19:50.480 --> 19:54.480
Sure.

19:56.680 --> 19:59.080
Thanks.

19:59.080 --> 20:01.560
When are you
going to tell him?

20:01.560 --> 20:03.200
Later.

20:03.200 --> 20:05.360
Later.

20:05.360 --> 20:06.920
How could you
let this happen?

20:06.920 --> 20:10.600
Lizzie invited me over.
I figured she OK'd it with you.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.320
Look, cut the crap, will you?

20:12.320 --> 20:14.920
You're a doctor, an adult.
It's your responsibility.

20:14.920 --> 20:16.920
Dad?  I'd better go.

20:16.920 --> 20:18.760
I warned you not to hurt her,
didn't I?

20:18.760 --> 20:20.560
I want to throw you
through that wall.

20:20.560 --> 20:21.840
Dad, Seth and I
need to talk.

20:21.840 --> 20:23.160
Dad, Seth and I
need to talk.

20:23.160 --> 20:24.160
Dad, this is between  us!

20:24.160 --> 20:27.000
Dad, this is between  us!

20:27.000 --> 20:29.280
Because I can handle it myself.

20:29.280 --> 20:30.360
Can you really?
Now, you listen to me.

20:30.360 --> 20:34.000
Can you really?
Now, you listen to me.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.440
Well, that's fine. That's fine. I'm
going to go and pick up Tommy.

20:37.440 --> 20:41.440
When I get back,
you'd better be gone.

20:46.560 --> 20:49.680
I was planning to save the surprise
for dessert.

20:49.680 --> 20:53.680
You're pregnant.

20:54.480 --> 20:58.480
Liz, sit down.

21:00.400 --> 21:01.960
How are you feeling?

21:01.960 --> 21:03.880
Except for Dad,
all right.

21:03.880 --> 21:05.000
What do you want to do?

21:05.000 --> 21:07.240
I haven't made up my mind.

21:07.240 --> 21:11.240
What do you think?

21:12.560 --> 21:16.560
Maybe the best way
to correct this accident

21:17.280 --> 21:20.320
is, uh...to put everything
back to square one.

21:20.320 --> 21:24.320
Yeah, but, Seth, there's a part
of me that wants to have this child.

21:24.800 --> 21:27.880
Don't be stupid!

21:27.880 --> 21:29.880
What do you...
You expect me...

21:29.880 --> 21:31.800
To do whatever
you think is right.

21:31.800 --> 21:34.000
Oh, boy. Oh, boy...

21:34.000 --> 21:36.080
Boy, I, um...

21:36.080 --> 21:40.080
Look, Liz,
I can't marry you.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.520
It's too soon for me
to marry anybody.

21:43.520 --> 21:47.520
OK. I understand.

21:49.040 --> 21:53.040
Besides...are you sure it's mine?

21:54.880 --> 21:57.440
No. Actually I'm not.

21:57.440 --> 22:00.000
A funny thing about Dad.
I think he's old-fashioned

22:00.000 --> 22:02.200
and narrow-minded,
but nine times out of ten

22:02.200 --> 22:06.200
he turns out to be
a great judge of character.

22:06.880 --> 22:10.880
Get out.

22:22.480 --> 22:24.320
DOOR OPENS

22:24.320 --> 22:26.800
Hi.

22:26.800 --> 22:28.720
I came to get you up,
Tommy's away.

22:28.720 --> 22:32.720
I've really got to study
for this poli sci quiz.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.800
Oh.

22:35.800 --> 22:38.800
Um...Lizzie,
about last night,

22:38.800 --> 22:40.800
I apologise,
sweetheart.

22:40.800 --> 22:43.040
I promised myself
I wouldn't lose my temper.

22:43.040 --> 22:45.160
You know, I didn't
do this on purpose.

22:45.160 --> 22:47.320
I know that.

22:47.320 --> 22:50.800
God, you know, I was only on
my prescription a day.

22:50.800 --> 22:53.200
I should have
had Seth condomised.

22:53.200 --> 22:57.200
Yeah.

22:57.400 --> 23:00.280
Or you could've waited, you know.
You could've said no.

23:00.280 --> 23:01.400
Dad.

23:01.400 --> 23:02.800
All right. All right.

23:02.800 --> 23:05.200
You're not going to marry this
fellow, are you?

23:05.200 --> 23:06.360
No.

23:06.360 --> 23:08.880
When the baby arrives, we'll deal
with it the same way

23:08.880 --> 23:12.040
as everything else, as a family -
no shame and lots of Lots of pride.

23:12.040 --> 23:16.040
I appreciate that and I know
how hard this is for you.

23:16.480 --> 23:20.000
I'm going to ace the test, come to
the hospital and have an abortion.

23:20.000 --> 23:24.000
Uh, Lizzie, honey...you don't have
to make this decision now.

23:24.280 --> 23:25.840
You have a lot of time.

23:25.840 --> 23:28.520
Believe me, Dad, I thought about
the choices all night.

23:28.520 --> 23:31.560
You've got Tommy to take care of,
I haven't finished school.

23:31.560 --> 23:34.720
Having a baby without a father
just wouldn't be fair.

23:34.720 --> 23:38.480
But, sweetheart, there are ethical
considerations and practical ones.

23:38.480 --> 23:41.240
Relax the forehead, Dad,
and stop worrying.

23:41.240 --> 23:45.240
I've got to study.

23:49.480 --> 23:51.360
# I need you so badly

23:51.360 --> 23:54.000
# I can't think
of anything but you #

23:54.000 --> 23:55.920
Luther,
I need a cardboard box.

23:55.920 --> 23:57.360
Well, how about this one?

23:57.360 --> 24:00.720
Oh, great.

24:00.720 --> 24:04.720
No, thanks.
Soggy bottom.

24:13.840 --> 24:16.480
I want you to take this down
to the mailroom.

24:16.480 --> 24:20.480
It's a present for Mrs Craig's
mother in Peterborough.

24:21.040 --> 24:22.280
It's heavy.

24:22.280 --> 24:23.720
It's a porcelain urn.

24:23.720 --> 24:26.360
Hopefully, the next time I see that,
she'll be inside.

24:26.360 --> 24:28.120
Slap
a "fragile" label on it.

24:28.120 --> 24:29.840
"The Cutting Edge." Easy read.

24:29.840 --> 24:32.800
That upwardly mobile orderly,
I can really identify.

24:32.800 --> 24:35.960
I'm seeing
the author this afternoon.

24:35.960 --> 24:37.400
Give him my best.

24:37.400 --> 24:39.840
Oh, I'll give him
something,

24:39.840 --> 24:42.000
but it won't
be your best.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.240
The autopsy showed a long-term
deterioration

24:44.240 --> 24:45.680
in Mr Belvedere's arteries.

24:45.680 --> 24:47.560
But he was in
such good health.

24:47.560 --> 24:49.960
He didn't drink or smoke.

24:49.960 --> 24:52.880
Worked out on
the rowing machine every day.

24:52.880 --> 24:54.840
Bill was
in great shape.

24:54.840 --> 24:57.680
Well, genetics play a part.
Look at Jim Fixx, the jogger.

24:57.680 --> 25:00.240
I mean, who could be have been
in better condition?

25:00.240 --> 25:03.040
You're saying you can pump iron
and go for the burn,

25:03.040 --> 25:04.680
but when your time's up,

25:04.680 --> 25:08.000
all the aerobics in the world
won't keep you from keeling over?

25:08.000 --> 25:10.840
Dad just wasn't built
to go more than 45?

25:10.840 --> 25:13.760
Your father may have had a
predisposition to heart trouble.

25:13.760 --> 25:16.560
Very likely, his sensible diet
and exercise

25:16.560 --> 25:19.520
actually prolonged his life
to its maximum limit.

25:19.520 --> 25:23.080
If I knew
he was going to wear out so soon,

25:23.080 --> 25:25.800
I would've taken
better care of him.

25:25.800 --> 25:27.760
If there's anything else
I can do...

25:27.760 --> 25:30.120
No, you've been
very kind. Thank you.

25:30.120 --> 25:32.600
We'd like you at the memorial
service tonight,

25:32.600 --> 25:34.320
if you're not busy.

25:34.320 --> 25:36.560
Dad was a real
popular guy.

25:36.560 --> 25:40.480
I'm sure his friends would want
to say goodbye.

25:40.480 --> 25:42.880
Biff and Maryanne
have persuaded me.

25:42.880 --> 25:45.760
We should have
an open casket.

25:45.760 --> 25:47.640
&lt; Excuse me.

25:47.640 --> 25:51.640
(LUTHER) Excuse me.

25:54.960 --> 25:56.840
KNOCKING

25:56.840 --> 26:00.840
Phillip,
please sit down.

26:03.160 --> 26:05.680
You owe an apology to Dr Arrowsmith.

26:05.680 --> 26:06.760
Why?

26:06.760 --> 26:08.360
In my day,
young men were taught

26:08.360 --> 26:10.320
to treat their
elders with respect.

26:10.320 --> 26:12.880
In my day,
respect is something that is earned.

26:12.880 --> 26:14.800
You don't
know anything about me, boy.

26:14.800 --> 26:15.880
Boy?!

26:15.880 --> 26:18.920
Look, I'm not sitting here
playing this game.

26:18.920 --> 26:19.680
Dr Chandler.

26:19.680 --> 26:20.800
Dr Chandler.

26:20.800 --> 26:23.160
you can fine me. Hell, you can even
spank me.

26:23.160 --> 26:26.240
Nobody, least of all this fat cat,
is going to look down at me.

26:26.240 --> 26:30.240
I'm not telling you
to stay, Phillip, I'm asking.

26:31.120 --> 26:31.960
(LAUGHS)

26:31.960 --> 26:34.600
(LAUGHS)

26:34.600 --> 26:37.440
Oh, I'm sorry. It's just that
he reminds me of me.

26:37.440 --> 26:41.360
Without the melanin,
of course.

26:41.360 --> 26:43.800
I started at
Boston General, 1946.

26:43.800 --> 26:46.200
And after four years
in the army,

26:46.200 --> 26:50.000
I was tired of authority figures
telling me how to practise medicine.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.240
Besides, I wanted to be
out in the world...

26:53.240 --> 26:55.640
making house calls,
helping the sick...

26:55.640 --> 26:59.160
getting to
know people, families.

26:59.160 --> 27:02.200
So now I'm a...fat cat.

27:02.200 --> 27:05.240
Patients are willing
to pay for my expertise.

27:05.240 --> 27:08.480
Now, what am I supposed
to do, say no?

27:08.480 --> 27:11.600
Private practice is something only
the rich can afford.

27:11.600 --> 27:13.360
It saps the best talent.

27:13.360 --> 27:15.200
Mark my words,
Dr Chandler.

27:15.200 --> 27:18.000
It's also the future
of our profession.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.600
Hospitals are leaning toward
outpatient clinics,

27:20.600 --> 27:21.960
shorter stays.

27:21.960 --> 27:23.680
Doctors are
finally realising

27:23.680 --> 27:26.160
they can have
a normal workday

27:26.160 --> 27:27.520
and a better life.

27:27.520 --> 27:29.880
And more to
the specific case...

27:29.880 --> 27:32.360
by not listening
to Dr Arrowsmith,

27:32.360 --> 27:33.880
you were deprived

27:33.880 --> 27:36.760
of a vital piece
of this family's history.

27:36.760 --> 27:40.200
Debbie's father suffered from G-cell
hyperplasia...

27:40.200 --> 27:41.960
an inherited condition.

27:41.960 --> 27:44.680
That causes chronic
and severe ulcers.

27:44.680 --> 27:46.680
I suggest you do
an endoscope biopsy,

27:46.680 --> 27:50.680
and see if we need
to schedule Miss Hoffman for surgery.

27:53.120 --> 27:57.120
Anything else?

27:57.600 --> 27:58.840
No. No.

27:58.840 --> 28:02.840
Thank you.

28:03.400 --> 28:05.160
I'll send your husband up to you

28:05.160 --> 28:09.160
as soon as he arrives,
Mrs Hollenback.

28:18.680 --> 28:20.920
Donald?

28:20.920 --> 28:23.320
Every day they build
a new skyscraper

28:23.320 --> 28:25.560
it erases the view, doesn't it?

28:25.560 --> 28:27.600
Used to be able
to see the harbour.

28:27.600 --> 28:29.560
I talked
to Lizzie downstairs

28:29.560 --> 28:33.560
just before she went in.

28:35.000 --> 28:38.240
Helen, I feel like a complete
failure as a parent.

28:38.240 --> 28:39.680
She's a wonderful girl.

28:39.680 --> 28:40.800
Yeah.

28:40.800 --> 28:42.880
Is that enough?

28:42.880 --> 28:46.880
All we can do is try to teach our
children well.

28:47.640 --> 28:50.200
But there comes a point

28:50.200 --> 28:53.720
when we have to respond
to who they've become.

28:53.720 --> 28:54.800
Yeah.

28:54.800 --> 28:57.600
A difficult challenge,
to say the least.

28:57.600 --> 29:00.920
Maureen always said, "Enjoy your
kids while you can

29:00.920 --> 29:04.920
"because tomorrow they'll be
wrecking the car."

29:06.160 --> 29:09.000
Every time that phone rings
late at night, Helen,

29:09.000 --> 29:12.400
the first thing in my mind is,
where's Lizzie?

29:12.400 --> 29:15.760
I'm having a hell of a time
realising that she's a grown woman

29:15.760 --> 29:18.480
in charge of her own life.
That puts me on the sidelines.

29:18.480 --> 29:19.840
I have to stay
out of the way

29:19.840 --> 29:22.560
but I'm torn between
what I really believe is right

29:22.560 --> 29:24.800
and letting her
find out for herself.

29:24.800 --> 29:26.000
In any case,

29:26.000 --> 29:29.520
what's important is  not
what's going on downstairs,

29:29.520 --> 29:32.400
but how you respond
after the fact.

29:32.400 --> 29:36.400
Yeah.

29:36.400 --> 29:40.400
I'd love to have grandchildren
someday.

29:41.480 --> 29:45.480
Yeah.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.280
How's Liz?

30:05.280 --> 30:08.480
The usual. Cramping
the next few hours.

30:08.480 --> 30:10.680
You give her
Demerol for the pain?

30:10.680 --> 30:11.920
Tylenol threes.

30:11.920 --> 30:13.320
You want to see her?

30:13.320 --> 30:14.600
Well...

30:14.600 --> 30:18.600
no, I don't think so.

30:28.760 --> 30:31.400
The blood tests
and biopsy were positive,

30:31.400 --> 30:34.960
corroborating Dr Arrowsmith's
diagnosis

30:34.960 --> 30:36.200
of G-cell
hyperplasia.

30:36.200 --> 30:37.880
I'm going to have to operate

30:37.880 --> 30:41.080
and remove the acid-secreting
part of your stomach.

30:41.080 --> 30:43.360
What are the risks?

30:43.360 --> 30:45.680
We can't guarantee that the ulcers
won't return

30:45.680 --> 30:48.360
and there's also a
chance of disordered bowel function

30:48.360 --> 30:51.480
for several weeks following surgery.

30:51.480 --> 30:53.560
And this was
Arrowsmith's idea?

30:53.560 --> 30:54.960
Yes.

30:54.960 --> 30:56.200
Sweet old guy.

30:56.200 --> 30:59.520
Always there with a lollipop
and a silly smile.

30:59.520 --> 31:01.480
He's devoted
to your family.

31:01.480 --> 31:03.600
He is. Mother
swears by him.

31:03.600 --> 31:07.600
He's good at cocktail chatter,
comfortable to be around.

31:08.560 --> 31:10.560
But the joke between us kids

31:10.560 --> 31:14.560
is he could turn a common cold
into strep throat like that.

31:15.880 --> 31:19.880
Well, he knows what he's talking
about this time.

31:20.960 --> 31:23.440
Excuse me, Dr Kiem, is Debbie
allowed visitors?

31:23.440 --> 31:24.640
Yes.

31:24.640 --> 31:27.320
She has a bevy
of friends out here.

31:27.320 --> 31:29.000
OK, boys, come on in.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.360
(DONALD DUCK-LIKE) Hi, Debbie!
How you feeling?

31:31.360 --> 31:35.280
Give me a kiss! Oh, boy!

31:35.280 --> 31:39.280
Taking or using parts of the body
without consent is mutilation.

31:40.440 --> 31:42.240
We've abused their trust.

31:42.240 --> 31:45.160
The Belvederes were going to have
a closed casket.

31:45.160 --> 31:47.560
This underground trade
in body parts

31:47.560 --> 31:50.440
could have an adverse
effect on donors.

31:50.440 --> 31:52.520
If people stop
donating transplant organs

31:52.520 --> 31:55.680
because the demand is being met by
black market...

31:55.680 --> 31:56.720
A disaster.

31:56.720 --> 31:59.040
There are long
lists of patients

31:59.040 --> 32:00.600
waiting
for hearts, kidneys.

32:00.600 --> 32:03.520
Many will die
for lack of donors.

32:03.520 --> 32:05.320
We have no choice.

32:05.320 --> 32:09.320
Better bring Bedder
up on charges.

32:10.720 --> 32:13.880
All I want to do is put
Mr Belvedere back together again.

32:13.880 --> 32:17.880
Be prepared to tell
the family the truth.

32:31.040 --> 32:35.040
I'm sorry, sir, you must have
a copy of the book to meet Dr C.

32:35.680 --> 32:37.560
I'm not interested in meeting him.

32:37.560 --> 32:41.560
I'm interested in beating him.
Get out of my way.

32:42.760 --> 32:44.960
Next. And what's your name?

32:44.960 --> 32:46.200
You know my name.

32:46.200 --> 32:48.000
I'm a doctor not a mind reader.

32:48.000 --> 32:52.000
You're a plagiarist, Doe.

32:53.320 --> 32:57.200
You know, Papa H warned me
at the bull run in Pamplona

32:57.200 --> 32:58.440
about guys like you.

32:58.440 --> 33:00.600
Manager! Toss
this bibliophobe out of here!

33:00.600 --> 33:02.040
Come along, buddy.

33:02.040 --> 33:04.080
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

33:04.080 --> 33:06.720
The party is over.

33:06.720 --> 33:09.320
Hi, Dr. Craig.
How's the hand?

33:09.320 --> 33:13.320
I'll show you how it is,
up close and personal.

33:34.880 --> 33:36.840
Get off of me!

33:36.840 --> 33:38.360
Let go of my legs!

33:38.360 --> 33:39.560
Off!

33:39.560 --> 33:43.560
Let go of my...!

33:44.520 --> 33:48.520
SIREN WAILS

33:49.640 --> 33:51.120
'Stumbling down
Locust Walk,

33:51.120 --> 33:54.120
'coming back from
Franklin Field.'

33:54.120 --> 33:56.960
You and me
and Sweeney.

33:56.960 --> 34:00.280
After Kazmaier and Princeton
lowered the boom.

34:00.280 --> 34:02.440
I beg your pardon.

34:02.440 --> 34:04.840
You don't
remember me, do you?

34:04.840 --> 34:07.240
No.

34:07.240 --> 34:10.280
Robin Baskins. I was in
your graduating class

34:10.280 --> 34:14.280
at Penn-Wharton
school.

34:14.960 --> 34:18.239
Oh, my god, yeah.

34:18.239 --> 34:22.239
Sigma chi.

34:22.960 --> 34:26.960
Treasurer.

34:27.600 --> 34:29.000
What the hell happened?

34:29.000 --> 34:32.320
Embezzled. Indicted. In jail.

34:32.320 --> 34:35.480
Baskins.
Sticky fingers, huh?

34:35.480 --> 34:39.480
You have a run
in your hose, Sheila.

34:40.040 --> 34:43.120
There he is, officer. The one with
the moustache and tired eyes.

34:43.120 --> 34:45.239
Sit down.

34:45.239 --> 34:46.440
It's about time.

34:46.440 --> 34:49.040
It took me a while to raise
the cash.

34:49.040 --> 34:51.199
They don't take
the platinum card, you know, Mark.

34:51.199 --> 34:52.480
They don't take
the platinum card, you know, Mark.

34:52.480 --> 34:55.080
Prettiest girl
at Penn.

34:55.080 --> 34:56.719
Yeah, yeah, after
Candice Bergen.

34:56.719 --> 34:58.040
Yeah, yeah, after
Candice Bergen.

34:58.040 --> 35:01.560
Never mind. This judicial system
really toasts my torts.

35:01.560 --> 35:03.920
I mean, they release Doe
on his own recognisance

35:03.920 --> 35:05.280
and I languish in the brig.

35:05.280 --> 35:07.200
Mark, I read that book.

35:07.200 --> 35:10.280
Thank god your name's
not on the cover.

35:10.280 --> 35:12.720
"Loins. Creamy thighs."

35:12.720 --> 35:15.600
I counted 30 variations
on the word wet.

35:15.600 --> 35:18.040
Mark, explain
something to me.

35:18.040 --> 35:21.040
Honey, please, the hand therapy
was going badly,

35:21.040 --> 35:22.560
the memoirs were boring.

35:22.560 --> 35:24.400
I was just...

35:24.400 --> 35:27.040
Mark, we've been in the same
bed for 30-odd years.

35:27.040 --> 35:30.720
How come you never used
that expertise on me?

35:30.720 --> 35:33.240
I always
loved you, Ellen.

35:33.240 --> 35:34.680
That sounds like...

35:34.680 --> 35:36.320
Robin Baskins!

35:36.320 --> 35:38.880
Are you...
Will you, please, come on?

35:38.880 --> 35:41.280
Send this parcel post.

35:41.280 --> 35:43.960
"Peterborough,
New Hampshire."

35:43.960 --> 35:45.520
Charge it to Dr Mark Craig.

35:45.520 --> 35:48.560
Stick a "fragile" label on it.
"Handle with care".

35:48.560 --> 35:51.840
Will do.

35:51.840 --> 35:54.360
Damp and sticky.

35:54.360 --> 35:58.360
Better seal this.

35:59.880 --> 36:03.720
Thanks for tattling. Hope I can
return the favour someday.

36:03.720 --> 36:07.680
I'm not the only
guy around here who's into parts,

36:07.680 --> 36:10.400
so don't just put
the finger on me.

36:10.400 --> 36:14.120
I'm telling you,
if I go...

36:14.120 --> 36:18.120
I know where all
the bodies are buried.

36:18.680 --> 36:19.920
Take your pick.

36:19.920 --> 36:21.880
They're booked
for Potter's Field.

36:21.880 --> 36:24.040
Choose the guy who looks
most like your man,

36:24.040 --> 36:28.040
and hope the mortician's a whiz
with powder and pan cake.

36:28.880 --> 36:32.880
(SIGHS) Well, uh...

36:35.280 --> 36:39.280
Well, this one wins
by a nose.

36:43.040 --> 36:45.080
Ah, there you are, Daniel.

36:45.080 --> 36:47.840
I had to make a pit stop. I hate to
attend a board meeting

36:47.840 --> 36:49.360
with a full bladder.

36:49.360 --> 36:50.840
I felt the urge myself.

36:50.840 --> 36:52.640
You know, we've got a problem.

36:52.640 --> 36:54.560
Maybe we ought to
run a faucet.

36:54.560 --> 36:57.560
The feasibility study,
have you read it?

36:57.560 --> 36:59.520
Darnell didn't
mince any words.

36:59.520 --> 37:01.040
I don't see any way out

37:01.040 --> 37:03.400
of St Eligius'
financial pickle.

37:03.400 --> 37:05.080
We can only have
three choices -

37:05.080 --> 37:09.080
pour in more and more money
just to keep treading water....

37:09.200 --> 37:12.040
A hard concept to grasp
in the men's room.

37:12.040 --> 37:13.720
The feeling is
that the trustees

37:13.720 --> 37:15.880
will vote
to recommend selling the hospital

37:15.880 --> 37:17.600
to a private health corporation.

37:17.600 --> 37:18.960
What can we do to stop them?

37:18.960 --> 37:20.840
I'm in favour
of selling.

37:20.840 --> 37:23.840
At least the profit management
companies can go through

37:23.840 --> 37:26.960
our cost centres line by line,
to determine what must stay

37:26.960 --> 37:29.640
and what can be reduced
or eliminated.

37:29.640 --> 37:32.080
And in doing so,
St Eligius will cease to be

37:32.080 --> 37:33.960
a viable part of the community.

37:33.960 --> 37:36.480
We can't run this business
with belt and suspenders.

37:36.480 --> 37:39.280
We won't even need pants if all we
have to do is bend over.

37:39.280 --> 37:42.600
I was here when this property was
purchased from the archdiocese.

37:42.600 --> 37:44.080
Certain promises were made.

37:44.080 --> 37:46.120
Daniel, that was
over 30 years ago.

37:46.120 --> 37:48.680
Well, I'm not going to sit by
and watch this hospital

37:48.680 --> 37:50.600
turn into a wholesale
health factory.

37:50.600 --> 37:53.000
Well, then we only have one
other scenario.

37:53.000 --> 37:53.480
Oh?

37:53.480 --> 37:55.400
Oh?

37:55.400 --> 37:57.800
drink a toast
to a glorious run,

37:57.800 --> 38:01.800
padlock the doors.

38:06.520 --> 38:07.880
How is she?

38:07.880 --> 38:10.920
Stable. Dr Kiem
did an excellent job.

38:10.920 --> 38:12.320
Mm-hmm.

38:12.320 --> 38:14.200
I, uh...

38:14.200 --> 38:16.080
I wanted
to thank you

38:16.080 --> 38:18.880
for persuading Debbie to have
the surgery now.

38:18.880 --> 38:20.440
Well, you called the play.

38:20.440 --> 38:22.480
My job was just
to run the pattern.

38:22.480 --> 38:25.880
I know Debbie thinks I'm an old
fuddy-duddy, a buffoon.

38:25.880 --> 38:27.320
I'm like a third parent -

38:27.320 --> 38:29.600
whatever I say,
she does the opposite.

38:29.600 --> 38:31.920
If you hadn't backed me,
she would've said no.

38:31.920 --> 38:35.920
It's all
in the tone of voice.

38:36.560 --> 38:39.240
You know, I never did
apologise to you.

38:39.240 --> 38:41.120
That's true.

38:41.120 --> 38:43.280
Well, I shouldn't
have prejudged you.

38:43.280 --> 38:47.280
You're right.
Me, neither.

38:47.320 --> 38:50.320
I walk into that on call
and saw some guy asleep.

38:50.320 --> 38:53.120
And black.
And 40 years my junior.

38:53.120 --> 38:57.120
I assumed you were a know-nothing
affirmative action project.

38:57.160 --> 38:59.320
But you're smart.

38:59.320 --> 39:01.680
You care.

39:01.680 --> 39:03.560
And truth be told,

39:03.560 --> 39:07.560
you know more medicine
than I ever will.

39:09.600 --> 39:12.200
I don't have the connection
you have to your patients.

39:12.200 --> 39:14.160
They come and go,
I never see them again.

39:14.160 --> 39:18.160
I'm in a shoe store
the other day,

39:18.360 --> 39:21.400
the counter lady says hello. She
says she was a patient of mine

39:21.400 --> 39:25.400
two years ago. I saved her life.
I don't remember.

39:26.040 --> 39:29.720
Ever since she had her first period
and ran to me terrified,

39:29.720 --> 39:31.840
I've been trying to explain
to this child

39:31.840 --> 39:33.480
the mysteries of the universe.

39:33.480 --> 39:35.760
But she's in
a different area code.

39:35.760 --> 39:38.560
A trust fund
worth millions...

39:38.560 --> 39:40.800
the bane of her
mother's existence,

39:40.800 --> 39:44.520
the Dippy Duck
diaper service.

39:44.520 --> 39:48.520
You have to love
a girl like that.

39:49.520 --> 39:51.120
Well, I got rounds.

39:51.120 --> 39:55.120
Oh, I have a gift
for Debbie.

39:55.800 --> 39:57.680
And, uh...

39:57.680 --> 40:01.680
one for you.

40:04.360 --> 40:08.360
Think about going into
private practice, huh?

40:25.200 --> 40:28.120
GLASS SHATTERS

40:28.120 --> 40:32.120
I'll see Mr Sandman
in post-op.

40:32.200 --> 40:36.200
Ahem.

40:40.840 --> 40:43.400
Uh...Dr. Craig.

40:43.400 --> 40:46.560
A word with you, sir.

40:46.560 --> 40:49.760
Look, I was wrong to run away,
to steal your manuscript,

40:49.760 --> 40:52.160
but I had a good reason.

40:52.160 --> 40:55.040
Serving as your assistant
gave my life meaning.

40:55.040 --> 40:58.480
I mean, working beside you,
basking in your personality.

40:58.480 --> 41:00.880
You have so much character, Dr
Craig, I have none.

41:00.880 --> 41:03.480
I thought if I took a little bit,
you wouldn't miss it.

41:03.480 --> 41:05.000
Surgery went well.

41:05.000 --> 41:08.760
Your dad will be fine.

41:08.760 --> 41:12.160
I showed the pages
to a publisher.

41:12.160 --> 41:16.160
And he was so effusive
in his praise...

41:16.640 --> 41:18.080
Well, I took credit.

41:18.080 --> 41:20.080
Then I couldn't
stop myself.

41:20.080 --> 41:21.440
I got hooked -

41:21.440 --> 41:23.280
a Craig junkie.

41:23.280 --> 41:26.960
The fawning, the adulation,
the free hotels.

41:26.960 --> 41:30.120
Look...
but I'm going public.

41:30.120 --> 41:32.560
I'm going to reveal myself
on an HBO special,

41:32.560 --> 41:36.560
and at that time, I'll announce
that you're the author.

41:37.400 --> 41:38.800
You can have everything -

41:38.800 --> 41:40.720
the praise, the spotlights,

41:40.720 --> 41:42.360
the home video rights.

41:42.360 --> 41:45.800
Me, I'll fade away
to the sixth floor.

41:45.800 --> 41:48.360
Psych ward, here I come.

41:48.360 --> 41:50.960
Oh, geez Louise.

41:50.960 --> 41:54.480
OK. Keep on being Dr C

41:54.480 --> 41:57.360
for as long as
this donkey ride lasts.

41:57.360 --> 42:00.200
You mean it?
Do you mean it? Do you mean it?

42:00.200 --> 42:01.480
Yes.

42:01.480 --> 42:03.440
You're so generous.  No,

42:03.440 --> 42:06.960
practical. As my wife pointed out,
if my patients learn

42:06.960 --> 42:08.440
&lt; that I wrote that sleaze,

42:08.440 --> 42:10.080
I'd lose all their confidence.

42:10.080 --> 42:11.800
So go ahead, have a field day.

42:11.800 --> 42:13.560
I only want one thing.

42:13.560 --> 42:14.720
Name it.

42:14.720 --> 42:16.280
The money.

42:16.280 --> 42:18.120
Next week we sit down
with lawyers,

42:18.120 --> 42:20.600
define profits,
set percentages.

42:20.600 --> 42:24.240
I get the lion's share. I'll
compensate you for being the front.

42:24.240 --> 42:27.080
Milk that personal appearance circuit
for all it's worth.

42:27.080 --> 42:28.360
Deal.

42:28.360 --> 42:32.360
And I want one thing
from you.

42:33.960 --> 42:37.960
Would you autograph
my copy?

42:41.000 --> 42:43.560
OK.

42:43.560 --> 42:44.920
Choose your hue.

42:44.920 --> 42:48.920
Felt tip
or nylon stylus.

42:53.200 --> 42:57.200
SOMBRE MUSIC

42:58.520 --> 43:00.320
Dr Novino,
thanks for coming.

43:00.320 --> 43:01.400
You're welcome.

43:01.400 --> 43:05.400
Mother hoped
you'd be here.

43:07.880 --> 43:09.960
I am so glad you came.

43:09.960 --> 43:13.960
Thank you.

43:19.520 --> 43:23.520
He never looked better.

43:27.320 --> 43:31.320
&lt; Dad?

43:31.760 --> 43:35.760
&lt; Daddy?

43:39.560 --> 43:41.320
What is it, sweetie?

43:41.320 --> 43:43.800
I feel really warm,
and I'm crampy.

43:43.800 --> 43:47.800
That's all right.
That's normal.

43:48.880 --> 43:51.680
Um...

43:51.680 --> 43:54.880
..I was
thinking, uh...

43:54.880 --> 43:58.080
Tommy's birthday's
coming up, right?

43:58.080 --> 44:01.000
Maybe we ought to do something
special this year.

44:01.000 --> 44:04.800
Maybe we ought to take a trip.
What do you think?

44:04.800 --> 44:08.440
Yeah, that would be nice. We could
visit Aunt Constance up in Sunapee.

44:08.440 --> 44:09.520
No, no, no, I mean...

44:09.520 --> 44:13.520
I mean something, er, something
we've never done before

44:14.960 --> 44:17.120
like Washington DC,
see the Smithsonian,

44:17.120 --> 44:19.520
the White House,
and all that.

44:19.520 --> 44:22.680
Sure. That would be fun.

44:22.680 --> 44:25.400
You're going to be fine, honey.

44:25.400 --> 44:27.440
Just get some rest,
all right?

44:27.440 --> 44:30.840
Yeah.

44:30.840 --> 44:33.400
Tough day.

44:33.400 --> 44:35.320
I love you, you know.

44:35.320 --> 44:38.640
I know that.

44:38.640 --> 44:40.360
I love you, too.

44:40.360 --> 44:44.360
Yeah. Ok.

44:45.360 --> 44:49.360
Good night, Dad.

44:50.160 --> 44:54.160
Good night, sweetie.
