00:08.572 --> 00:12.108
Every time I wake up...

00:12.110 --> 00:14.911
I'm disappointed...

00:14.913 --> 00:18.081
I didn't die.

00:18.083 --> 00:21.250
The crappy food,

00:21.252 --> 00:22.719
the bedsores...

00:22.721 --> 00:26.222
It's bad enough
being stuck with coma boy

00:26.224 --> 00:27.974
drooling all day,

00:27.976 --> 00:30.610
but every time I see your face,

00:30.612 --> 00:33.429
I feel sorry for the woman
who's gotta look at it.

00:33.431 --> 00:35.398
Mr. James, that's enough.

00:35.400 --> 00:37.967
You probably go home,

00:37.969 --> 00:40.103
all alone,

00:40.105 --> 00:42.488
with a sleazy magazine

00:42.490 --> 00:44.073
and cheap Chinese,

00:44.075 --> 00:48.077
crying yourself to sleep
on your saggy couch.

00:48.079 --> 00:49.695
You know what?
All I have to do

00:49.697 --> 00:52.331
is turn up the morphine
and you'll be dead.

00:55.286 --> 00:59.088
Oh. Oh. You kill me,

00:59.090 --> 01:03.042
and I'll haunt you
till the day you die.

01:03.044 --> 01:06.462
When you wake up,
you'll see my face.

01:06.464 --> 01:11.267
When you go to work,
you'll see my face.

01:11.269 --> 01:14.887
And every time you kiss
that $3.00 whore

01:14.889 --> 01:17.840
you call a wife,

01:17.842 --> 01:19.692
you'll see my face
laughing at you.

01:19.694 --> 01:21.227
Ha ha ha ha.

01:21.229 --> 01:22.779
Laughing at you,

01:22.781 --> 01:25.698
as she lays there
pretending to enjoy it,

01:25.700 --> 01:29.035
when we all know she'd
rather be with the postman.

01:31.122 --> 01:33.189
Am I right?
I'm right, aren't I?

01:33.191 --> 01:35.575
Aren't I? Ha ha ha ha!

01:35.577 --> 01:37.877
Oh, you're right.

01:37.879 --> 01:39.545
Oh.

Sir--

02:08.610 --> 02:10.026
Daddy! Daddy!

02:10.027 --> 02:12.495
Sir--you've been
in a coma, sir.

02:12.497 --> 02:14.280
Just relax.
Just relax.

02:14.282 --> 02:15.564
Just relax.

02:16.901 --> 02:18.734
Sir.
Hey.

02:18.736 --> 02:20.736
This is your lucky day.

02:39.556 --> 02:41.724
She's screaming.

02:41.726 --> 02:43.926
I'm worried someone's
gonna hear her.

02:43.928 --> 02:45.561
I'll handle it.

02:45.563 --> 02:48.597
Are you sure
we should keep her?

02:48.599 --> 02:51.100
She's perfect.

02:51.102 --> 02:54.153
Don't you agree,
Mr. Conrad?

02:58.125 --> 03:00.076
What chapter are you on?

03:00.078 --> 03:02.078
The part where
she's at the coal mines.

03:02.080 --> 03:04.113
Say what you will
about his writing, Maeve,

03:04.115 --> 03:06.435
it's fascinating the way he weaves
characters into situations, right?

03:07.168 --> 03:09.552
Yeah, I mean, I'm not sure
what I think of it.

03:09.554 --> 03:10.836
It's slightly obtuse.

03:10.838 --> 03:12.338
Yeah, he tends
to be that way.

03:12.340 --> 03:13.890
I probably should
have warned you.

03:13.892 --> 03:15.892
He's not really anything
like sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

03:15.894 --> 03:18.561
Still my favorite.

03:18.563 --> 03:19.729
Guess what.

03:19.731 --> 03:20.730
What?

03:20.732 --> 03:22.882
I think the stalker's gone.

03:22.884 --> 03:24.834
The emails have stopped.

03:24.836 --> 03:26.468
Really? Since when?

03:26.470 --> 03:27.570
Two weeks ago.

03:27.572 --> 03:28.571
Why didn't you tell me?

03:28.573 --> 03:29.939
I wanted to make sure.

03:29.941 --> 03:31.857
- What about the phone calls?
- No, I haven't gotten any.

03:31.859 --> 03:34.827
No more heavy breathing
on the machine, no more hang-ups.

03:34.829 --> 03:37.613
You know, oftentimes when a
stalker's advances are completely ignored,

03:37.615 --> 03:40.333
their erotomanic fantasies will be
diverted to a more receptive target.

03:40.335 --> 03:42.285
I went to the store yesterday.

03:42.287 --> 03:45.755
I even sat in the cafe and had
coffee without my disguise on.

03:45.757 --> 03:48.490
Something deep inside my gut
tells me he's gone.

03:48.492 --> 03:50.593
I think it's over, Spencer.

03:50.595 --> 03:52.211
Well, our instincts
exist for a reason.

03:52.213 --> 03:54.163
They're definitely
a response to specific...

03:54.165 --> 03:55.131
I want to meet you.

03:55.133 --> 03:56.832
...environmental
stimuli.

04:03.724 --> 04:06.508
Did you hear me, Spence?

04:06.510 --> 04:09.028
Yeah, I--I--
no, I heard you.

04:09.030 --> 04:11.981
Well, what do you think?

04:13.016 --> 04:15.318
I think it's time.

04:22.709 --> 04:24.360
Let's get started.

04:24.362 --> 04:25.050
Uh...

04:25.075 --> 04:26.696
Sorry I'm late, guys.
I had an appointment.

04:26.697 --> 04:28.197
Yeah. Okay.

04:28.199 --> 04:30.383
3 days ago, Bruce Phillips
was found dead

04:30.385 --> 04:32.868
with his blond hair
dyed black.

04:32.870 --> 04:35.037
He had been put in a box
and left on a busy street.

04:35.039 --> 04:36.188
A custom-made box.

04:36.190 --> 04:38.891
Maybe our unsub
was a carpenter.

04:38.893 --> 04:41.177
He stuffed him in there
practically folding him in half.

04:41.179 --> 04:42.478
He had also been hung
and restrained

04:42.480 --> 04:44.180
and that's where
the plot thickens like bad soup.

04:44.182 --> 04:47.383
Yesterday, Justin Marks
and Connie Foster, who were dating,

04:47.385 --> 04:50.319
they went missing two miles
away from the first abduction site.

04:50.321 --> 04:51.654
A couple?
He's escalating.

04:51.656 --> 04:53.489
Yes. This morning
Justin's body was found.

04:53.491 --> 04:56.692
He had been hung. He had been
stuffed in a box left in an alley.

04:56.694 --> 04:58.795
Officers say his brown hair
had been dyed black.

04:58.820 --> 05:00.697
Connie's still missing.

05:00.698 --> 05:01.998
So he probably
still has her.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Why would he reject
Justin overnight

05:04.002 --> 05:06.669
but keep the first male
victim for two days?

05:06.671 --> 05:08.371
Something about him
didn't work out.

05:08.373 --> 05:09.672
Look at his neck.

05:09.674 --> 05:11.173
He was hung
multiple times.

05:11.175 --> 05:13.676
The question is, what does
he do with Connie?

05:13.678 --> 05:15.511
He could make her watch him
abuse the men

05:15.513 --> 05:17.430
or have asphyxiative sex
with them.

05:17.432 --> 05:19.932
Well, a brunette male and a woman
are crucial to this guys fantasy.

05:19.934 --> 05:21.250
Well, he's kept Connie.

05:21.252 --> 05:23.386
Maybe she's the object
of his desire.

05:23.388 --> 05:25.304
Well, our first order
of business is finding her

05:25.306 --> 05:26.939
and then making sure
he doesn't do this again.

05:26.941 --> 05:28.391
Wheels up in 30.

05:43.907 --> 05:45.274
Shh, shh.

05:45.276 --> 05:48.244
Please, please,
just tell me where Justin is.

05:48.246 --> 05:49.378
Shh, shh, shh.

05:49.380 --> 05:51.613
Please, tell me
what you did with him.

05:51.615 --> 05:55.885
Please, just tell me
that he's okay, please.

05:55.887 --> 05:59.338
Connie,
I can't do that.

06:00.591 --> 06:02.842
Just like this...

06:02.844 --> 06:05.177
There, like that.

06:05.179 --> 06:07.146
There.

06:07.148 --> 06:08.481
There.

06:08.483 --> 06:10.182
Just stay there.

06:12.937 --> 06:15.938
Boo-hoo.
Boo-hoo-hoo.

06:15.940 --> 06:17.990
Say cheese.

06:20.144 --> 06:25.998
Cheeeeese...

07:02.353 --> 07:04.173
William Shakespeare
once wrote,

07:04.273 --> 07:06.156
"Love looks not
with the eyes,

07:06.442 --> 07:07.891
but with the mind."

07:07.893 --> 07:09.393
All right, let's go over
victimology.

07:09.395 --> 07:11.862
Both male victims
had their hair dyed black,

07:11.864 --> 07:13.063
and the woman is a brunette.

07:13.065 --> 07:15.765
The guys are similar.
Same ages, same builds.

07:15.767 --> 07:18.535
They were also abducted
outside their homes,

07:18.537 --> 07:19.820
which were all
in the same area.

07:19.822 --> 07:21.405
So they were probably
being stalked.

07:21.407 --> 07:23.373
Was Connie with her boyfriend
when she was abducted?

07:23.375 --> 07:25.042
It looks that way.
Her purse was found

07:25.044 --> 07:26.660
on the ground
outside of his house.

07:26.662 --> 07:29.079
So this involves
some kind of ruse.

07:29.081 --> 07:30.414
It's difficult
to lure most people

07:30.416 --> 07:31.715
from the security
of their own homes.

07:31.717 --> 07:33.250
Well, some people
let their guard down.

07:33.252 --> 07:34.718
Yeah, but stalking victims
vary their routes home.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.220
They enter and exit
through different doors,

07:36.222 --> 07:37.838
they wear disguises. They don't
talk to anyone in their driveway.

07:37.840 --> 07:39.289
They hardly talk
to anyone at all.

07:39.291 --> 07:40.390
They're--they're terrorized.

07:40.392 --> 07:41.791
Okay, so maybe they were
followed, Reid.

07:41.793 --> 07:43.594
I mean, bottom line
is the unsub escalated.

07:43.596 --> 07:45.512
The first male
was abducted alone,

07:45.514 --> 07:46.763
the second was
with his girlfriend.

07:46.765 --> 07:48.432
Well, what do we know
about her?

07:48.434 --> 07:51.652
Connie was in her 30s,
baked cakes for a living,

07:51.654 --> 07:52.969
she never had a run-in
with the law.

07:52.971 --> 07:54.738
Assuming he kept her,
what's the reason?

07:54.740 --> 07:57.741
She's a necessity. Somehow
she fits into his fantasy.

07:57.743 --> 08:01.078
And so far, that need may be
what's keeping her alive.

08:01.080 --> 08:02.696
So what we know
is that we have an unsub

08:02.698 --> 08:04.198
with a fantasy
or a deep desire

08:04.200 --> 08:05.815
that requires the man
to look a specific way.

08:05.817 --> 08:07.984
Since he rejected Justin
so quickly, he's probably

08:07.986 --> 08:09.836
looking for a replacement
as we speak.

08:24.519 --> 08:26.336
Did you get it?

08:26.338 --> 08:28.355
Yeah, I got everything.
Nails, wire.

08:28.357 --> 08:29.773
We still need a crank.

08:29.775 --> 08:31.441
We don't have
a lot of time.

08:31.443 --> 08:33.943
Tomorrow will be here
before we know it.

08:33.946 --> 08:36.313
Yeah, but we can't
just choose anybody.

08:36.315 --> 08:38.448
It has to be the right guy.

08:38.450 --> 08:39.732
Someone with black hair,

08:39.735 --> 08:43.654
same size, and nothing less
than perfect.

08:46.708 --> 08:48.725
Gin rummy.

09:00.705 --> 09:03.390
Help!

09:03.392 --> 09:04.558
Help!

09:04.560 --> 09:06.843
Please help!

09:06.845 --> 09:08.395
Help, please!

09:08.397 --> 09:09.713
Oh, my God.

09:09.715 --> 09:10.714
Please!

09:10.716 --> 09:11.682
Oh, my God.

09:11.684 --> 09:13.517
Yeah.
You've gotta help!

09:13.519 --> 09:15.885
Please, please, you gotta help.

09:15.887 --> 09:17.070
What happened?

09:17.072 --> 09:18.105
Do you have a phone?

09:18.107 --> 09:20.107
Yes. Come in.

09:33.404 --> 09:35.739
This is a pretty open
disposal site.

09:35.741 --> 09:38.675
The unsub wasn't trying
to hide his victim.

09:38.677 --> 09:40.711
Detective Martin,
is this how he was found?

09:40.713 --> 09:43.347
The crime scene's exactly
how we found him.

09:43.349 --> 09:46.016
The coroner's office was pretty
backed up due to a bus crash,

09:46.018 --> 09:48.452
so CSI just finished
working the scene.

09:48.454 --> 09:49.770
Look at the box.

09:49.772 --> 09:51.772
It's like he's on display.

09:51.774 --> 09:53.256
How considerate.

09:53.258 --> 09:55.759
Okay, so this was taken
the day he was abducted.

09:55.761 --> 09:57.944
His hair was longer then.

09:59.697 --> 10:01.982
And he painted
his nails red.

10:01.984 --> 10:04.100
He didn't do that
to the first guy.

10:04.102 --> 10:06.236
So what's going on here?

10:06.238 --> 10:08.038
He's trying
to emasculate them.

10:08.040 --> 10:11.107
It's all part of
the unsub's fantasy.

10:11.109 --> 10:15.445
Please,
somebody help me.

10:18.466 --> 10:20.634
Uh!

10:25.473 --> 10:28.742
What are you doing?

10:35.066 --> 10:36.299
Please...

10:37.985 --> 10:39.936
Please just let me go.

10:39.938 --> 10:43.306
How can I let you go?
We haven't even started.

10:43.308 --> 10:45.609
What did I do to you?
Please...

10:45.611 --> 10:47.327
Please let...

10:47.329 --> 10:48.362
Let me help you.

10:51.315 --> 10:54.984
You know, you really
should get some rest.

10:54.986 --> 10:57.671
You have bags
under your eyes.

10:57.673 --> 11:00.323
Did you kill Justin?

11:03.461 --> 11:06.279
It wasn't right.

11:06.281 --> 11:08.515
The next one will be better.

11:10.301 --> 11:12.302
Do you want me to set up?

11:12.304 --> 11:14.471
Yes. Yes, please, set up.

11:16.308 --> 11:18.358
Now...

11:18.360 --> 11:20.193
I have to take
your clothes off.

11:20.195 --> 11:22.312
No, please...No.

11:22.314 --> 11:25.014
No, please,
get away from me.

11:25.016 --> 11:26.283
I'm sorry,

11:26.285 --> 11:29.686
but it's the only way
I can work.

11:29.688 --> 11:31.020
No...No...

11:31.022 --> 11:32.989
No!

11:32.991 --> 11:35.959
No!

11:39.030 --> 11:40.163
No!

11:40.165 --> 11:41.631
Hotch, our latest abductee

11:41.633 --> 11:43.300
looks just like
our last two victims.

11:43.302 --> 11:44.835
His house is in
the hunting zone?

11:44.837 --> 11:46.103
Smack in the middle.

11:46.105 --> 11:48.472
Roommate came home
and saw blood on the window.

11:48.474 --> 11:50.006
Wallet and keys
are still here, too.

11:50.008 --> 11:51.558
What about hair color?

11:51.560 --> 11:53.143
Naturally black.

11:53.145 --> 11:54.644
He might not be
a surrogate.

11:54.646 --> 11:56.513
He might be the actual
object of our unsub's focus.

11:56.515 --> 11:58.565
Hotch, you might be right. You know
what, let me call you right back.

11:58.567 --> 12:00.734
I think I got something.
Good, thanks.

12:03.321 --> 12:05.388
It's a little light,
isn't it?

12:13.948 --> 12:16.583
That's not blood.

12:20.087 --> 12:23.457
I've been getting lame GSWs,
a few bus crash victims,

12:23.459 --> 12:26.075
but hanging? This is fun.

12:26.077 --> 12:27.994
Think it was sexual?

12:27.996 --> 12:30.464
Not in the
traditional sense.

12:30.466 --> 12:32.382
Well, look.

12:32.384 --> 12:34.100
There are numerous
ligature marks on the neck,

12:34.102 --> 12:36.603
indicating he was hung
multiple times.

12:36.605 --> 12:37.888
The ones without abrasions

12:37.890 --> 12:40.440
were probably made
by something soft, like fabric.

12:40.442 --> 12:43.092
Any idea how long
it went on for?

12:43.094 --> 12:46.480
Based on the different
varying coloration of the bruising,

12:46.482 --> 12:47.931
I'd say about 12 hours.

12:47.933 --> 12:51.117
This ligature mark with the
abrasion is the final one.

12:51.119 --> 12:52.936
There's an inverted
"V" in the back.

12:52.938 --> 12:56.039
He was hung with a leather strap or belt,
which is what killed him.

12:56.041 --> 13:00.076
Oh, we also found ketamine
in his system.

13:00.078 --> 13:01.411
Well, ketamine acts quickly.

13:01.413 --> 13:03.914
So he must have used a ruse
to get close to our victim.

13:03.916 --> 13:06.550
The bones were perfectly
disjointed.

13:06.552 --> 13:09.219
Could have dislocated from
the fall after hanging

13:09.221 --> 13:11.788
or when he shoved him
in the box.

13:11.790 --> 13:14.624
Well, actually, the bones
were dislocated antemortem.

13:14.626 --> 13:15.759
Oh.

13:15.761 --> 13:18.345
Goody. Overtime.

13:18.347 --> 13:20.630
Can you check to see if the bones
were dislocated in the same way?

13:22.800 --> 13:24.968
Ah.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.803
Yep.

13:26.805 --> 13:29.022
Same way.

13:29.024 --> 13:32.108
This guy's sicker
than my last girlfriend.

13:32.110 --> 13:36.446
The question is,
why is he doing this?

13:38.082 --> 13:40.149
Medieval
torturing techniques

13:40.151 --> 13:41.751
have a long, dense history.

13:41.753 --> 13:43.620
Skinning someone alive
was commonplace.

13:43.622 --> 13:45.539
Placing someone's hand
in boiling water

13:45.541 --> 13:47.791
happened almost daily
in the church.

13:47.793 --> 13:50.126
Please, just tell me
what you want.

13:50.128 --> 13:52.178
This is what I want.

13:52.180 --> 13:53.630
Focus on the floor.

13:53.632 --> 13:57.000
Aah!

13:59.137 --> 14:01.137
From the way these joints
were disarticulated,

14:01.139 --> 14:03.857
it appears as though we're dealing
with either drawing and quartering

14:03.859 --> 14:06.726
or the rack.

14:06.728 --> 14:08.678
No!

14:08.680 --> 14:10.313
The rack was the most
prevalent way

14:10.315 --> 14:13.349
to disarticulate
the human body.

14:17.455 --> 14:19.072
Aah!

14:20.374 --> 14:23.126
Yes! That's it! That's it!

14:23.128 --> 14:25.862
If our unsub's using it,
he's beyond maniacal,

14:25.864 --> 14:27.196
he's a sadist.

14:27.198 --> 14:28.798
Garcia at your service.

14:28.800 --> 14:30.250
Can you find anyone
in the area

14:30.252 --> 14:33.587
that might sell of rent
medieval torture equipment?

14:33.589 --> 14:35.204
Besides a friend of mine
in knitting group?

14:35.206 --> 14:36.723
Try S & M suppliers.

14:36.725 --> 14:38.391
We're looking for
a stretching rack.

14:38.393 --> 14:40.810
Spanking the keys
as we speak.

14:40.812 --> 14:41.845
Don't worry, they like it.

14:41.847 --> 14:44.681
Okay, I have cross-checked stretching
equipment with S & M equipment

14:44.683 --> 14:47.767
and I found something
that stretches something,

14:47.769 --> 14:50.403
but I don't think it's the something
we're looking for.

14:50.405 --> 14:51.821
Maybe he made his own.

14:51.823 --> 14:53.106
That would be
pretty elaborate.

14:53.108 --> 14:54.658
I'm gonna keep looking.
I'll get back to you soon.

14:54.660 --> 14:55.775
Thanks.

14:55.777 --> 14:57.661
I just went to the latest
abductee's home.

14:57.663 --> 15:00.530
Not only did our unsub
use fake blood as some kind of ruse,

15:00.532 --> 15:02.916
but the front porch security
cameras were also disconnected

15:02.918 --> 15:04.250
right before the abduction.

15:04.252 --> 15:05.669
So he cased the site.

15:05.671 --> 15:07.754
It's residential streets,
a lot of people coming and going.

15:07.756 --> 15:08.922
That's high-risk behavior.

15:08.924 --> 15:10.423
Maybe the unsub
didn't care.

15:10.425 --> 15:12.876
He needed him
and it was worth the risk.

15:12.878 --> 15:15.261
Why are they
doing this to us?

15:15.263 --> 15:17.514
I don't know.

15:17.516 --> 15:19.149
They're ready.

15:19.151 --> 15:23.269
Okay. I hope it works
this time.

15:44.992 --> 15:49.746
Eenie, meanie, miney, mo.

15:49.748 --> 15:51.881
Catch a tiger by the toe.

15:51.883 --> 15:54.584
If he hollers,
let him go.

15:54.586 --> 15:56.419
Eenie, meanie,

15:56.421 --> 15:58.454
miney...

16:00.175 --> 16:01.174
Mo.

16:01.176 --> 16:02.592
No.

16:04.929 --> 16:08.148
I pick...

16:08.150 --> 16:10.483
Y...O...U.

16:10.485 --> 16:13.353
Aah!

16:22.899 --> 16:25.135
The box is wrapped
this time.

16:25.138 --> 16:27.722
What is this, a gift?

16:34.196 --> 16:38.098
His natural hair color
is black and still he kills him.

16:38.100 --> 16:39.767
And, look, no neck wounds.

16:39.769 --> 16:41.786
Then how did he die?

16:41.788 --> 16:42.936
Maybe he bled out.

16:42.938 --> 16:44.455
Or he fell from something.

16:44.457 --> 16:45.740
Look at his hands.

16:45.742 --> 16:47.408
He bored holes
through the hands that ripped,

16:47.410 --> 16:49.460
and then he moved them
to the wrist.

16:49.462 --> 16:51.379
Reid, check the feet.

16:54.549 --> 16:56.283
Stigmata?

16:56.285 --> 16:57.618
Hanging
and then crucifixion.

16:57.620 --> 16:59.920
So this has to do
with religious beliefs.

16:59.922 --> 17:02.006
Maybe he's found
a new way to torture them?

17:02.008 --> 17:03.674
And still he's keeping Connie.

17:03.676 --> 17:05.675
Something about her is working.

17:05.678 --> 17:06.844
Hotch, look.

17:06.846 --> 17:08.311
These are the exact same jeans

17:08.314 --> 17:11.432
that victim number two
was wearing. Look at the trim.

17:12.901 --> 17:16.020
Bonner Brothers.
Is that a local store?

17:16.021 --> 17:19.240
About 5 miles.
Half thrift store, half yuppie mart.

17:19.242 --> 17:21.992
I'll have JJ and Morgan
check it out after we give the profile.

17:21.993 --> 17:24.310
Due to the sophisticated
nature of the crimes,

17:24.313 --> 17:27.330
we believe that we're looking for
a male unsub who's at least 30,

17:27.333 --> 17:28.666
who's torturing his victims.

17:28.668 --> 17:30.668
We think that's he's trying
to perfect a delusion

17:30.670 --> 17:32.986
at which he's failed
3 times.

17:32.988 --> 17:35.656
As with most
fantasy based crimes,

17:35.658 --> 17:40.160
the reality never lives up to the
perfection of what the unsub envisions.

17:40.162 --> 17:44.164
This fantasy involves the torture
and stretching of his victims,

17:44.166 --> 17:47.551
including men that have
had their hair dyed black by the unsub.

17:47.553 --> 17:50.337
Before he kills them, our unsub
fixes their hair and paints their nails.

17:50.339 --> 17:52.973
He's now escalated
to crucifying his latest victim,

17:52.975 --> 17:55.192
driving holes into
his hands and feet.

17:55.194 --> 17:57.394
Historically,
crucifixion is a sentence

17:57.396 --> 17:59.947
reserved for serious crimes.

17:59.949 --> 18:01.982
Which makes up believe
that somewhere in the unsub's past,

18:01.984 --> 18:03.617
he feels his victims
have wronged him,

18:03.619 --> 18:06.320
so now he's performing
some sort of inquisition.

18:06.322 --> 18:10.040
This time, you're
going to do it correctly,

18:10.042 --> 18:15.246
so that
he will learn his lesson.

18:15.248 --> 18:16.964
What lesson?

18:16.966 --> 18:18.916
You know what
I'm talking about!

18:18.918 --> 18:20.501
I don't.

18:20.503 --> 18:21.836
Yes, you do!

18:21.838 --> 18:24.037
Whether he's getting
his victims to repent

18:24.039 --> 18:26.707
or adhere to certain
religious beliefs,

18:26.709 --> 18:29.510
he is hanging them
as though they were victims

18:29.512 --> 18:31.395
of religious tribunals
of the 1100s.

18:31.397 --> 18:33.848
But something in his fantasy
is not working,

18:33.850 --> 18:35.349
because he keeps
discarding the men.

18:35.351 --> 18:37.351
He kills them and then
ritualistically

18:37.353 --> 18:39.069
places them in a box
with tissue paper.

18:39.071 --> 18:42.490
Which is odd, as his initial behavior
dehumanizes them.

18:42.492 --> 18:44.744
That means he values
those victims more

18:44.769 --> 18:46.077
when they're dead.

18:46.078 --> 18:47.895
So far we believe he has
spared the one woman

18:47.897 --> 18:49.363
that he still has in captivity.

18:49.365 --> 18:51.031
She's either
witnessing these horrors

18:51.033 --> 18:53.000
or being forced
to participate in them.

18:53.002 --> 18:55.569
Crucifixion is sadistic,
and watching it

18:55.571 --> 18:58.205
is the ultimate torture.

18:58.207 --> 19:00.291
Consequently, we believe
that the killings will continue to escalate

19:00.293 --> 19:03.210
as the unsub strives
to achieve his perfection.

19:03.212 --> 19:04.745
Thank you.

19:15.190 --> 19:17.191
Adam?

19:17.193 --> 19:19.810
Adam?

19:19.812 --> 19:22.029
They're ruining it.

19:22.031 --> 19:23.864
They're ruining it.

19:23.866 --> 19:26.233
I don't know what to do.

19:28.036 --> 19:30.487
I understand.

19:30.489 --> 19:33.324
There's something
I need to tell you.

19:33.326 --> 19:35.042
What? What is it?

19:35.044 --> 19:37.161
You're ruining it.

19:37.163 --> 19:39.013
Instead of taking command
like an adult,

19:39.015 --> 19:42.550
you're sitting in here
crying like a baby!

19:42.552 --> 19:45.452
Are you a baby?

19:45.454 --> 19:47.638
How can you say that?

19:47.640 --> 19:50.057
Do you want him
to die again?

19:50.059 --> 19:51.008
No!

19:51.010 --> 19:52.560
Then pull yourself
together.

19:52.562 --> 19:54.011
You're running out of time.

19:54.013 --> 19:57.514
You need to find
a father and a son.

20:02.520 --> 20:05.639
I'm ready when you are.

20:29.965 --> 20:33.000
Hi. May I help you?

20:33.002 --> 20:35.603
Uh, yeah. We're looking
for these clothes.

20:35.605 --> 20:37.137
We're out of these.

20:37.139 --> 20:38.138
I'm sorry.

20:38.140 --> 20:39.390
We're with the FBI.

20:39.392 --> 20:40.441
What's your name?

20:40.443 --> 20:41.442
Tucker. Tucker White.

20:41.444 --> 20:42.810
How may I help you?

20:42.812 --> 20:44.812
There's a victim in a case
that we're investigating

20:44.814 --> 20:47.231
who was wearing a shirt
and a pair of jeans from here.

20:47.233 --> 20:48.949
You mind if we show you
a picture?

20:48.951 --> 20:50.183
Sure. Whatever you need.

20:50.185 --> 20:52.019
Do you know this man?

20:52.021 --> 20:53.871
No. No, I don't.

20:53.873 --> 20:56.407
Would you happen to have
a record of who bought this stuff?

20:56.409 --> 20:59.026
Um, if he used
a credit card, maybe.

20:59.028 --> 21:01.161
But if he used cash,
probably not.

21:01.163 --> 21:02.529
But I can look for you.

21:02.531 --> 21:04.965
- We'd appreciate that.
- Right.

21:07.218 --> 21:08.869
Ooh.

21:08.871 --> 21:11.672
This is all very
Spencer Reid.

21:11.674 --> 21:13.090
Yeah, it sure is.

21:13.092 --> 21:15.175
Well, at least his style
is consistent.

21:15.177 --> 21:17.344
Yeah, what's going on
with him, anyway?

21:17.346 --> 21:20.648
Oh, I think
pretty boy has got a girlfriend.

21:20.650 --> 21:22.382
You do?

21:22.384 --> 21:24.151
Well, why hasn't he
told us?

21:24.153 --> 21:26.320
I respect his privacy.

21:26.322 --> 21:27.821
No, you don't.

21:27.823 --> 21:28.748
You're right, I don't.

21:28.749 --> 21:30.636
But I'm not about to play
twenty questions with someone

21:30.637 --> 21:31.794
I'm not sleeping with.

21:33.863 --> 21:35.396
What the--

21:35.398 --> 21:36.914
what--

21:38.867 --> 21:39.867
What the hell?

21:39.869 --> 21:41.035
Hey!

21:43.404 --> 21:44.571
Is this guy serious?

21:44.573 --> 21:46.106
This is Agent Jennifer Jareau.

21:46.108 --> 21:50.177
I need to put an APB out
on a brown Chrysler station wagon

21:50.179 --> 21:54.247
driven by a Tucker White
going east on Dover Street.

21:59.604 --> 22:01.221
There you are.

22:01.223 --> 22:03.524
How's the geographical
profiling going?

22:03.526 --> 22:05.859
And why are you
doing it in here?

22:05.861 --> 22:08.028
It's going good.
I'm just having trouble

22:08.030 --> 22:11.065
concentrating out there,
is all, so I came in here.

22:11.067 --> 22:12.599
Hmm.

22:12.601 --> 22:15.435
So what's with you today?

22:15.437 --> 22:18.539
Is this about...

22:18.541 --> 22:20.124
phone booth girl?

22:20.126 --> 22:23.210
She wants to meet.

22:23.212 --> 22:25.913
Wait. You guys
have never met?

22:27.215 --> 22:29.950
Aren't you curious
what she looks like?

22:29.952 --> 22:31.502
Oh, it doesn't matter
what she looks like.

22:31.504 --> 22:33.305
I mean, she's already
the most beautiful girl

22:33.330 --> 22:35.006
in the world to me.

22:35.007 --> 22:39.977
It's just--what if she
doesn't like me?

22:46.901 --> 22:49.403
Why wouldn't she like you?

22:49.405 --> 22:50.904
Because I'm weird.

22:50.906 --> 22:54.942
I slouch, my hair's too long,
my tie's perpetually crooked.

22:54.944 --> 22:56.493
Your hair's fine.

22:56.495 --> 22:58.643
Really? Thanks.
My mom thinks it's too long.

22:58.668 --> 22:59.914
So does my Aunt Ethel.

22:59.915 --> 23:01.648
Well, you're
not dating them.

23:01.650 --> 23:05.152
I just--I--I just wouldn't want
to ruin something so special

23:05.154 --> 23:09.423
over something so trivial
as looks.

23:10.675 --> 23:13.677
I think you're excited
but afraid.

23:15.013 --> 23:18.715
Seeing her will only make
the relationship better.

23:18.717 --> 23:20.184
Trust me.

23:20.186 --> 23:22.269
When does she want to meet?

23:22.271 --> 23:23.554
Right when we get back.

23:23.556 --> 23:24.972
Do it.

23:24.974 --> 23:27.107
Don't psych yourself out.

23:27.109 --> 23:29.676
We'll see.

23:35.066 --> 23:38.068
Sir, I have a mom and dad.

23:38.070 --> 23:39.736
They're looking for me.

23:39.738 --> 23:41.205
Shh, shh, shh.

23:41.207 --> 23:43.157
Hold still, Steph.

23:43.159 --> 23:45.292
This is gonna be great.

23:45.294 --> 23:48.712
My name is Connie.

23:48.714 --> 23:51.248
What are you doing?

23:51.250 --> 23:55.035
This is the only way
that I can make it stick.

23:55.037 --> 23:59.539
What are you talking about?

23:59.541 --> 24:00.841
Wow.

24:00.843 --> 24:02.843
She's perfect.

24:02.845 --> 24:04.044
I know.

24:04.046 --> 24:06.063
I know.

24:12.320 --> 24:13.720
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

24:13.722 --> 24:15.222
Hold still.

24:15.224 --> 24:17.724
Almost done.

24:21.162 --> 24:22.746
Tucker?

24:22.748 --> 24:25.032
This is a surprise.

24:25.034 --> 24:26.900
Hey, Adam.

24:26.902 --> 24:30.504
Um...the FBI came by today.

24:30.506 --> 24:31.788
The FBI? What for?

24:31.790 --> 24:34.875
Remember those clothes
I sold you last month?

24:34.877 --> 24:38.262
Some guy who was wearing them,
he ended up dead.

24:38.264 --> 24:40.681
Are you serious?

24:40.683 --> 24:43.750
He was killed,
as in murdered, Adam.

24:43.752 --> 24:45.769
Have you hurt someone?

24:45.771 --> 24:47.254
No.

24:47.256 --> 24:50.224
No. There must be
some misunderstanding.

24:50.226 --> 24:52.759
You bought all 8 sets, Adam.

24:54.729 --> 24:57.231
Look, ever since
your car accident...

24:57.233 --> 25:00.284
you've been acting
kind of funny.

25:00.286 --> 25:03.153
What's going on with you?

25:03.155 --> 25:07.274
Look, why don't you
come in and have some tea.

25:07.276 --> 25:08.876
You need to take
the edge off.

25:08.878 --> 25:10.994
I'm serious, Adam.

25:10.996 --> 25:14.381
Everything
is gonna be okay.

25:14.383 --> 25:16.967
Promise.

25:29.647 --> 25:32.482
Right. I'll get a warrant over there
as soon as possible.

25:32.484 --> 25:34.868
The owner of the vintage shop
bolted from the store.

25:34.870 --> 25:36.904
Well, I've got something
strange, too.

25:36.906 --> 25:38.355
The M.E. just called.

25:38.357 --> 25:41.525
Not only were there ligature
marks on victim 3's arms,

25:41.527 --> 25:44.111
but his jaw
was dislocated as well.

25:44.113 --> 25:46.246
His jaw?

25:46.248 --> 25:48.282
Why would you hang someone,
dislocate their joints and their jaw,

25:48.284 --> 25:51.151
and then crucify them?

25:55.707 --> 25:58.875
I can see your wheels turning.
Don't hold back.

25:58.877 --> 26:00.827
Maybe he's dislocating
their body parts

26:00.829 --> 26:02.930
so he can manipulate
them himself.

26:02.932 --> 26:04.831
For what purpose?

26:04.833 --> 26:06.967
Think about it for a second.
If you add the dislocation,

26:06.969 --> 26:09.336
the holes in the hands,
the strange clothing, and the odd makeup,

26:09.338 --> 26:11.638
I know this sounds crazy,
but what if our unsub

26:11.640 --> 26:15.142
is turning his victims
into human marionettes?

27:47.191 --> 27:49.526
The Greeks translated
"puppets" as "neurospasta,"

27:49.528 --> 27:51.578
which literally means
string-pulling.

27:51.580 --> 27:53.213
And throughout time
they've been used

27:53.215 --> 27:54.915
as a method to tell kings
a story so the subjects

27:54.917 --> 27:57.117
didn't have to speak
directly to him.

27:57.119 --> 27:58.802
It was a way
to hear the truth.

27:58.804 --> 28:00.637
It seems like this unsub's
doing something similar,

28:00.639 --> 28:02.339
using his puppets
to tell his story.

28:02.341 --> 28:04.207
He can't be controlling
them by hand.

28:04.209 --> 28:06.643
No, he probably built
some sort of contraption.

28:06.645 --> 28:08.311
And he's trying
to lift his victims.

28:08.313 --> 28:10.714
That could explain why
they discarded the men.

28:10.716 --> 28:12.733
- They were too heavy.
- What do you see?

28:12.735 --> 28:14.718
Well, I'm checking
the licenses of our victims,

28:14.720 --> 28:17.604
and each one weighed less
than the previous one.

28:17.606 --> 28:19.990
You know, if he's making human
marionettes, that also explains

28:19.992 --> 28:21.692
why he's stuffing
his victims into boxes.

28:21.694 --> 28:23.493
It's like a sick toy chest.

28:23.495 --> 28:25.278
So he is dehumanizing them,
but he's just not killing them.

28:25.280 --> 28:27.397
He's turning them into
his playthings.

28:27.399 --> 28:29.166
A father and son
were just abducted

28:29.168 --> 28:30.734
from a parking lot
at gunpoint.

28:30.736 --> 28:33.036
A witness saw a man
force them into a car.

28:33.038 --> 28:34.237
Dave, you and Blake
go check it out.

28:34.239 --> 28:36.590
I'll have Garcia start looking
for theater owners

28:36.592 --> 28:38.575
and puppeteers in the area.

28:38.577 --> 28:40.043
Okay. Let's to it again.

28:40.045 --> 28:42.095
Should we break their jaws?

28:42.097 --> 28:44.381
No. No.

28:44.383 --> 28:46.299
I need to hear them.

28:46.301 --> 28:49.720
Please, Adam, let us down.

28:49.722 --> 28:52.305
No. You guys have to
do it right this time.

28:52.307 --> 28:53.924
You have to save them.

28:53.926 --> 28:55.859
From what?

28:59.447 --> 29:00.814
From the robber.

29:00.816 --> 29:03.266
I told you.

29:04.152 --> 29:07.621
And...

29:07.623 --> 29:08.905
Again.

29:08.907 --> 29:11.158
Okay, there are 5 puppeteers/
marionetters in the area.

29:11.160 --> 29:13.710
Any of them recently
released from prison?

29:15.463 --> 29:18.448
No. They're working kids'
parties and at hospitals.

29:19.006 --> 29:21.724
What about someone who had a
traumatic incident with a brunette girl?

29:21.787 --> 29:24.171
That's kind of specific.

29:24.173 --> 29:26.973
Hold on, let me patch in
Morgan and JJ.

29:26.975 --> 29:28.425
Hey, we're at
the clothing store.

29:28.427 --> 29:30.727
We got the names of 5 people
who left numerous messages

29:30.729 --> 29:32.062
for Tucker this week.

29:32.064 --> 29:33.180
Give them to me.

29:33.182 --> 29:34.865
All right, we got Sam Holby,

29:34.867 --> 29:36.516
Terrence Crammer,

29:36.518 --> 29:38.235
Vincent Lang,

29:38.237 --> 29:40.103
Matt Parker,
and a Jill Olger.

29:40.105 --> 29:43.940
And no, and I'm cross-checking
those with Hotch's list of puppeteers.

29:43.942 --> 29:44.941
And no.

29:44.943 --> 29:45.992
So I've got 8 more names,

29:45.994 --> 29:47.444
some written on pads
in the back,

29:47.446 --> 29:48.978
others are frequent customers.

29:48.980 --> 29:50.997
Penelope, we need you
to trace the phone lines here, too,

29:50.999 --> 29:53.316
see if this guy Tucker
called the unsub today.

29:53.318 --> 29:56.169
Give me your money.
Give it now.

29:58.539 --> 30:00.207
That's your cue.

30:00.209 --> 30:02.592
What's my cue?

30:04.378 --> 30:07.514
You're supposed to say...

30:07.516 --> 30:08.882
"I don't have any money,"

30:08.884 --> 30:11.051
after he says,

30:11.053 --> 30:12.352
"give it to me now."

30:12.354 --> 30:14.354
Say it again,
Mr. Conrad.

30:14.356 --> 30:18.058
Give me your money.
Give it now.

30:19.560 --> 30:21.945
I don't have any money.

30:21.947 --> 30:24.898
You're lying.
I saw you with it.

30:26.183 --> 30:29.820
Dad, just give him
the money.

30:30.905 --> 30:32.789
I won't.

30:45.554 --> 30:48.588
Mitch, Mitch,
what are you doing?

30:48.590 --> 30:51.308
You're supposed to save
my father.

30:51.310 --> 30:55.545
My name is not Mitch, and
I'm not gonna say these lines.

31:00.151 --> 31:01.434
Ohh!

31:05.940 --> 31:07.157
Now...

31:07.159 --> 31:09.242
If you don't save him,

31:09.244 --> 31:10.911
then he is gonna die.

31:10.913 --> 31:13.246
Is that what you want?

31:18.252 --> 31:19.703
Aah!

31:21.038 --> 31:25.542
People, it's going to be
a full house.

31:25.544 --> 31:29.212
So, push through it.

31:29.214 --> 31:31.548
We just came from
the parking lot

31:31.550 --> 31:33.767
where the father and son
were abducted.

31:33.769 --> 31:36.019
It looks like the unsub
might be on the surveillance camera.

31:36.021 --> 31:38.939
Witness said
there was a blue van.

31:38.941 --> 31:40.590
Mm.

31:40.592 --> 31:41.641
Garcia.

31:41.643 --> 31:42.642
Yes, sir.

31:42.644 --> 31:43.944
Were there any incidents

31:43.946 --> 31:46.396
involving a father and son
in the puppeteers' histories

31:46.398 --> 31:47.530
that you found?

31:47.532 --> 31:50.283
Father and son. Okay.
No, it's coming up empty.

31:50.285 --> 31:52.319
What about
20 or 30 years ago?

31:54.438 --> 31:58.041
Well, there was a pretty famous
puppeteer in the late fifties

31:58.043 --> 31:59.626
named Alex Rain.

31:59.628 --> 32:00.827
He died in a robbery.

32:00.829 --> 32:01.861
His son witnessed it.

32:01.863 --> 32:02.996
What was the son's name?

32:02.998 --> 32:05.298
Adam Rain.
Mom died 10 years ago.

32:05.300 --> 32:06.769
Cross-check Adam's name with

32:06.794 --> 32:08.511
the names of the patrons
in the clothing store.

32:11.138 --> 32:12.505
Oh, I got a big old hit.

32:12.507 --> 32:14.407
Okay, Mr. Rain called
Tucker, the owner,

32:14.409 --> 32:16.309
40 times in the last month.

32:16.311 --> 32:19.062
And check this.
His father was most well-known

32:19.064 --> 32:21.681
for a pair of puppets
named Mitch and Steph.

32:21.683 --> 32:24.851
The male one had dark black hair,
the female was a redhead.

32:24.853 --> 32:25.969
You have an address?

32:25.971 --> 32:28.154
Last known was a building
on Pine Street,

32:28.156 --> 32:30.273
used to be his father's
theater.

32:30.275 --> 32:31.241
Come on, Dave.

32:31.243 --> 32:32.475
And guess what he drives.

32:32.477 --> 32:34.527
A blue van.
Call us back in the car.

32:40.868 --> 32:44.654
Two minutes until curtain.

32:44.656 --> 32:45.839
You ready?

32:45.841 --> 32:47.657
It's gonna be right
this time.

32:47.659 --> 32:49.693
Let's hope so.

32:58.102 --> 32:59.936
Break a leg.

33:18.823 --> 33:21.541
Ladies and gentlemen,

33:21.543 --> 33:25.378
truth is what
the storyteller brings you.

33:25.380 --> 33:28.999
He holds up a mirror
to your soul

33:29.001 --> 33:32.869
and reflects back the truth
of what happened,

33:32.871 --> 33:37.057
in or this case,
what should have happened.

33:37.059 --> 33:39.375
And so without further ado,

33:39.377 --> 33:43.046
the Rain Theater proudly
continues that great tradition

33:43.048 --> 33:46.816
in this very special
matinee performance

33:46.818 --> 33:48.818
of "The robbery."

33:48.820 --> 33:51.154
A family tale

33:51.156 --> 33:53.222
of love...

33:53.224 --> 33:55.825
and redemption.

34:08.723 --> 34:10.672
Somebody...

34:10.675 --> 34:14.210
Help us.

34:52.768 --> 34:54.659
When you pull at the strings
of Adam the puppeteer,

34:54.661 --> 34:56.962
he unravels faster than
a two-cent romance novel.

34:56.964 --> 34:59.431
He worked at a glue factory
most of his adult life.

34:59.433 --> 35:01.800
He was in a car accident that put
him in a coma for over a year.

35:01.802 --> 35:04.436
He woke up 3 months ago.
Straight away, the nurse says

35:04.438 --> 35:06.338
he starts acting really
childish, asking for his father,

35:06.340 --> 35:08.023
who died over 50 years ago.

35:08.025 --> 35:09.524
The head injury
must have been the trigger

35:09.526 --> 35:11.893
and he woke up with the delusion
that he was a boy again.

35:11.895 --> 35:13.695
Like a Peter Pan syndrome.

35:13.697 --> 35:15.314
And if there was damage
to the prefrontal cortex,

35:15.316 --> 35:16.782
he might lack rational
thought and empathy.

35:16.784 --> 35:19.151
So he's a psychopath
who thinks he's a kid again

35:19.153 --> 35:20.986
and wants to avenge
his father's death.

35:20.988 --> 35:23.322
If the robbery that killed the father
happened in the theater...

35:23.324 --> 35:25.190
He's reenacting that moment.

35:27.693 --> 35:30.679
Give me your money.
Give it now.

35:31.698 --> 35:33.832
I don't have any money.

35:33.834 --> 35:37.252
You're lying.
I saw you with it.

35:39.006 --> 35:41.139
Dad, just give him
the money.

35:41.141 --> 35:42.140
I won't.

35:42.142 --> 35:45.010
I won't.

35:46.346 --> 35:50.349
Dad, just give him
the money.

35:50.351 --> 35:51.900
I won't.

35:57.556 --> 36:00.558
Come on, do something!

36:00.560 --> 36:02.060
Do something!

36:02.062 --> 36:06.231
Please, Mitch, Steph!

36:06.233 --> 36:07.749
Come on, do something!

36:07.751 --> 36:10.118
Do something!

36:13.089 --> 36:15.374
Come on, do something.

36:15.376 --> 36:17.008
Do something.

36:23.916 --> 36:26.551
Adam Rain, this is the FBI!

36:26.553 --> 36:28.720
I need to see your hands.

36:28.722 --> 36:30.472
What--what are you doing?

36:30.474 --> 36:32.023
Somebody call security.

36:32.025 --> 36:34.726
You can't ruin this.

36:34.728 --> 36:36.445
Adam, put down the gun.

36:36.447 --> 36:39.264
We're in the middle
of a performance.

36:40.199 --> 36:41.983
This is not a performance.

36:41.985 --> 36:43.618
Yes, it is a performance

36:43.620 --> 36:45.370
and this is not
how it ends!

36:45.372 --> 36:47.439
We need to get these people
to a hospital.

36:47.441 --> 36:51.460
After they save my father

36:51.462 --> 36:53.611
from the robber.

36:54.580 --> 36:55.630
What robber, Adam?

36:55.632 --> 36:57.282
From him!

36:57.284 --> 36:58.283
He did it!

36:58.285 --> 37:01.169
We have to stop him!

37:03.789 --> 37:07.642
Mr. Rain, it's only a puppet.

37:07.644 --> 37:08.994
There's no one there.

37:08.996 --> 37:10.328
When you were young,

37:10.330 --> 37:12.797
your dad loved you so much,

37:12.799 --> 37:16.818
he never told you
that the puppets weren't real.

37:16.820 --> 37:18.320
That's not true.

37:18.322 --> 37:19.855
It is.

37:19.857 --> 37:21.523
And that's why
Steph and Mitch

37:21.525 --> 37:23.575
couldn't save him
that day.

37:23.577 --> 37:26.161
They only moved
when he made them.

37:27.646 --> 37:29.748
You're lying.

37:29.750 --> 37:31.967
Adam, don't
do to these people

37:31.969 --> 37:34.669
what the robber did
to your father.

37:38.157 --> 37:40.709
You can save them.

38:03.200 --> 38:04.199
Thank you.

38:04.201 --> 38:05.517
Thank you.

38:05.519 --> 38:07.903
Thank you.

38:09.372 --> 38:11.406
Thank you.

38:11.408 --> 38:13.858
Thank you.

38:13.860 --> 38:15.693
Thank you.

38:41.153 --> 38:44.990
Well, I think after this long,
hard week we just had,

38:44.992 --> 38:47.492
we should all head over
to Rossi's

38:47.494 --> 38:49.344
and pop open
some old, expensive wine.

38:49.346 --> 38:50.495
That's a plan.

38:50.497 --> 38:52.464
Could we maybe
play some games, too?

38:52.466 --> 38:54.099
Oh, what kind of games?

38:54.101 --> 38:55.333
You tell me,
sweet cheeks.

38:55.335 --> 38:58.003
Hotch, we're heading
to Rossi's. You in?

38:58.005 --> 38:59.421
Uh, Jack's got
a sleepover this weekend,

38:59.423 --> 39:01.256
so I was gonna go
to New York and see Beth.

39:01.258 --> 39:02.541
- Wow...
- Hubba hubba.

39:02.543 --> 39:03.592
Ah...

39:03.594 --> 39:05.710
Wait a second.
Where's Reid?

39:05.712 --> 39:08.930
He said he had something
important to do.

39:08.932 --> 39:11.716
Spencer
has a girlfriend.

40:13.446 --> 40:14.696
Hi.

40:14.698 --> 40:17.415
Um, Spencer Reid for two.

40:17.417 --> 40:19.167
You are the first
to arrive.

40:19.169 --> 40:20.952
Would you
like to be seated?

40:20.954 --> 40:22.987
Yes, I'd like that.

41:34.060 --> 41:35.527
Hello.

41:35.529 --> 41:38.029
Maeve, it's me. Listen,
don't come to the restaurant.

41:38.031 --> 41:40.565
What are you talking
about? I'm outside.

41:40.567 --> 41:42.200
Go home.

41:43.836 --> 41:46.204
Spencer, if you don't want
to meet me, you can just say it.

41:46.206 --> 41:48.906
No, that's not it. Look,
I think your stalker's here.

41:48.908 --> 41:50.542
What?

41:50.544 --> 41:52.127
Please just go.

41:52.129 --> 41:54.713
Okay.

42:06.425 --> 42:08.760
- Hey.
- Hey, Dick.

42:08.762 --> 42:11.095
Good to see you.

42:13.265 --> 42:15.366
So what's up?

42:19.271 --> 42:20.955
Excuse me, sir.

42:20.957 --> 42:23.792
A woman just left this
for you.

42:38.724 --> 42:40.725
Thomas Merton once wrote,

42:40.727 --> 42:42.894
"Love is our true destiny.

42:42.896 --> 42:44.395
"We do not find
the meaning of life

42:44.397 --> 42:45.847
"by ourselves alone.

42:45.849 --> 42:48.483
We find it with another."
