00:07.007 --> 00:10.010
Who's this beautiful girl?

00:10.093 --> 00:12.637
Oh! Yuck!

00:13.346 --> 00:16.474
Someone needs her dirty diaper changed.

00:16.975 --> 00:18.852
-Come here.
-Here's the stuff.

00:18.935 --> 00:21.396
-While you change her, I'll go pee.
-Sure.

00:22.772 --> 00:24.691
Let's see, is your back dirty?

00:25.233 --> 00:27.277
No, perfect.

00:42.333 --> 00:44.044
Who's the cutest baby?

00:44.586 --> 00:46.004
So cute…

01:10.445 --> 01:11.529
Mariana!

01:11.613 --> 01:12.739
What are you doing?

01:19.704 --> 01:22.415
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

02:19.764 --> 02:22.350
So, half your genes are from that man?

02:22.433 --> 02:23.309
Yes.

02:23.893 --> 02:27.063
That's why I want to meet him,
but there's not much information here.

02:27.147 --> 02:30.024
Do you need my help?
Facebook is for rookies.

02:30.108 --> 02:31.442
All right, help me.

02:32.777 --> 02:35.905
If my mom won't tell me the truth,
we'll find it ourselves.

02:36.406 --> 02:37.991
Right, little penguin?

02:38.074 --> 02:39.242
Right?

02:39.742 --> 02:40.577
Pablo.

02:41.202 --> 02:42.996
Just the man I was looking for.

02:43.079 --> 02:44.122
Me?

02:44.205 --> 02:45.248
What did I do now?

02:45.331 --> 02:48.710
Mariana says you're kind of a math genius.

02:48.793 --> 02:51.379
I have a test coming up.
If I fail, my mom will kill me.

02:51.462 --> 02:53.798
What's your schedule,
and what's your tutoring rate?

02:53.882 --> 02:54.924
I don't know.

02:56.509 --> 02:57.635
Where are you going?

02:58.136 --> 03:00.138
-To the park, with the babies.
-Let's go.

03:00.221 --> 03:01.264
No, it's fine.

03:01.347 --> 03:03.016
You should schedule Ceci's classes.

03:03.099 --> 03:06.227
And keep working on the app,
we need to make progress.

03:12.692 --> 03:15.028
You know
why she doesn't want you to go, right?

03:15.612 --> 03:16.988
She's meeting Elena.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.411
It's fine, no problem.

03:24.454 --> 03:27.540
Mariana and I are good,
working as a team for Regina.

03:29.918 --> 03:32.587
-Alta, are the girls taking their stroll?
-Yes, ma'am.

03:33.254 --> 03:35.882
-Mrs. Mariana is out with them.
-Great.

03:35.965 --> 03:37.842
I won't make it to lunch today, okay?

03:38.343 --> 03:39.802
Or even to dinner.

03:39.886 --> 03:42.889
I texted you today's menus.
Let me know if you need anything.

03:42.972 --> 03:44.307
-Yes, ma'am.
-Thank you.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.396
Ana!

03:50.480 --> 03:53.274
The security guard says
you've been here since 6:00 a.m.

03:53.358 --> 03:56.486
You told me I needed to prove
I have the time and disposition.

03:56.986 --> 03:58.947
This is to prove I do have them.

03:59.030 --> 04:02.450
-Yes, but don't go overboard.
-No, don't worry.

04:02.533 --> 04:05.703
For moms with babies,
days start quite early.

04:11.668 --> 04:14.128
Hey, hey. Enough already.

04:14.212 --> 04:17.507
You're not the first or the last man
who has to work with his lover.

04:17.590 --> 04:19.759
We weren't lovers.
It was a mere transaction.

04:20.426 --> 04:21.261
Exactly.

04:22.053 --> 04:23.304
-You were lovers.
-No.

04:23.888 --> 04:25.223
She wasn't my lover!

04:26.307 --> 04:28.810
We were… two close friends.

04:28.893 --> 04:31.479
Who… occasionally had sex.

04:32.438 --> 04:36.234
Sure, but if you keep seeing her,
you'll be lovers again.

04:38.528 --> 04:39.737
We weren't lovers.

04:40.238 --> 04:41.197
Okay?

04:42.073 --> 04:44.325
I won't lose Ana or my family
over a damn mistake.

04:45.618 --> 04:47.453
Well, lovers or not…

04:47.954 --> 04:50.039
I think you should stop seeing her.

04:50.123 --> 04:54.460
How? Ana asked me to help her
with her business since "she's family."

04:55.044 --> 04:57.588
-Her daughter and grandchild live with me.
-Let's see.

04:58.214 --> 04:59.090
Calm down.

04:59.173 --> 05:02.427
I'll help you with Tere, okay?
I'll help her with her business.

05:03.052 --> 05:04.721
But do something about Mariana.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.640
You have to get her out of there,
she's a time bomb.

05:10.018 --> 05:12.520
And if you ask me,
you were in fact lovers.

05:16.524 --> 05:17.692
Shit.

05:18.276 --> 05:21.779
I always knew your mom was crazy,
but I never knew how much.

05:23.865 --> 05:27.368
I have to go now.
The band's new girl just arrived.

05:27.869 --> 05:30.455
-You'll come to the gig, right?
-Yes, of course.

05:30.538 --> 05:32.790
It'll be my first night out
after giving birth.

05:32.874 --> 05:34.208
I hope my clothes fit.

05:34.292 --> 05:36.878
-Yes, especially with those big boobs.
-Hey.

05:37.795 --> 05:39.130
-Well, I'm off.
-That's mean.

05:39.213 --> 05:42.008
Don't you dare stand me up,
you big fat cow.

05:49.098 --> 05:52.810
PABLO - I FOUND OUT EVERYTHING
ABOUT HALF OF YOUR GENES.

05:53.561 --> 05:54.854
No way.

05:55.563 --> 05:57.815
You're a big-time hacker.

05:57.899 --> 05:59.650
You scored points with me today.

05:59.734 --> 06:02.445
Well, I hope I can beat whatever
Elena scored today.

06:02.528 --> 06:06.032
Oh, come on, Pablo.
Are you still competing with her?

06:06.115 --> 06:07.408
Oh, I'm joking.

06:07.492 --> 06:09.077
I know you're just friends.

06:09.160 --> 06:10.953
And that makes me happy.

06:12.997 --> 06:15.375
I hate it when she and I fight.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.675
Honey, would you turn off the lights?

06:24.759 --> 06:26.761
I need to sleep, I'm exhausted.

06:28.471 --> 06:30.223
Ana, we need to talk.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.643
Really, right now?

06:34.602 --> 06:37.563
Sorry, it's not my fault
there's no other time.

06:39.023 --> 06:40.024
What is it?

06:40.108 --> 06:41.901
Mariana has to go.

06:44.654 --> 06:46.781
-Did something happen?
-No.

06:47.949 --> 06:50.868
It's time for our family
to go back to normal.

06:52.537 --> 06:55.331
Regina has a family
and we'll be there for her.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.125
I don't know what you're waiting for.

06:57.625 --> 06:59.293
For Valentina to drink formula.

06:59.919 --> 07:03.506
You said two weeks tops,
and it's been close to a month.

07:04.298 --> 07:06.175
It's what we agreed on.

07:09.053 --> 07:11.222
You're right, I'll talk to her.

07:28.573 --> 07:30.783
Mariana? Sorry about the costume.

07:30.867 --> 07:33.953
I came from a casting call.
They wanted to see me as Santa.

07:36.539 --> 07:39.709
Your message said
you want me for a kids' party.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.879
Well, actually…

07:43.421 --> 07:45.465
I'm Tere's daughter.

07:45.548 --> 07:49.427
And I want to know how and when you met.

08:21.584 --> 08:23.794
No one ever smiled
at me like your mother did.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.547
I need to know if…

08:27.215 --> 08:29.217
you're my biological father.

08:33.095 --> 08:34.472
Sweetie, that's impossible.

08:34.555 --> 08:36.474
I never slept with your mom.

08:36.557 --> 08:37.892
She had a boyfriend.

08:44.815 --> 08:47.068
Do you happen to know
who that boyfriend was?

08:47.652 --> 08:48.945
I know everything about him.

08:49.445 --> 08:51.614
We became friends after he beat me up.

08:53.533 --> 08:56.827
Ronald, I think
you went a little overboard.

08:56.911 --> 09:00.706
You said shocking and realistic,
that's what I did.

09:00.790 --> 09:03.668
No, I wanted it to look like a rash,

09:03.751 --> 09:04.752
not leprosy.

09:05.461 --> 09:06.671
Fuck!

09:06.754 --> 09:09.757
-What happened to her?
-Nothing, she's fine. It's makeup.

09:09.840 --> 09:10.925
Why?

09:11.008 --> 09:13.094
Juan Carlos wants
Regina and you to move out.

09:13.177 --> 09:16.264
And if Valentina is allergic
to formula, that won't happen.

09:16.347 --> 09:19.350
But why would Juan Carlos
want us out of this house?

09:19.433 --> 09:23.104
We agreed you'd stay for two weeks
and it's been way longer than that.

09:23.187 --> 09:26.107
Ana, come on. He won't buy this.

09:26.190 --> 09:27.858
Of course he will.

09:27.942 --> 09:28.985
Yes.

09:29.068 --> 09:31.279
-Yes.
-Of course he will.

09:31.362 --> 09:33.990
-But of course.
-Yes, I'll make sure he does.

09:35.283 --> 09:37.702
-What's wrong with Valentina?
-Nothing, she's fine.

09:37.785 --> 09:40.705
-It's makeup, it's fake.
-I think it looks great.

09:40.788 --> 09:42.915
It does, but it's not Halloween yet.

09:43.749 --> 09:44.709
Listen, Ceci.

09:45.334 --> 09:47.837
You don't want Regina
and Mariana to leave, do you?

09:48.713 --> 09:49.922
No, of course not.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.842
Well, you'll have to keep this secret.

09:52.925 --> 09:53.968
Really keep it.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.559
Sir?

10:01.642 --> 10:03.519
Come with me, please.

10:03.603 --> 10:04.604
-He's coming.
-What?

10:07.648 --> 10:10.109
-What's wrong with Valentina?
-Formula made her ill.

10:10.192 --> 10:11.736
She's having an allergic reaction.

10:11.819 --> 10:14.405
Her fever's down,
but she threw up all day.

10:14.488 --> 10:15.656
It was horrible, Dad.

10:15.740 --> 10:20.369
Like The Exorcist, she wouldn't stop
vomiting, her head almost spun.

10:20.453 --> 10:21.954
What did the pediatrician say?

10:22.038 --> 10:23.205
That it's not serious.

10:23.289 --> 10:26.542
But she should quit formula
and continue with breast milk.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.878
Yes, until she starts eating solids.

10:28.961 --> 10:32.506
-Oh…
-Not now, she's falling asleep.

10:32.590 --> 10:34.008
-Sir…
-Everything's fine.

10:34.091 --> 10:37.345
You should let the women handle it.

10:37.428 --> 10:38.429
Out you go.

10:43.893 --> 10:46.395
Alta! Why are you laughing?

10:59.909 --> 11:01.452
Hey, I'm sorry.

11:01.535 --> 11:03.704
Traffic was awful.

11:04.205 --> 11:05.081
How are you?

11:06.582 --> 11:08.584
Excuse me, do we know each other?

11:08.668 --> 11:10.127
Yes, you are Tere, right?

11:10.211 --> 11:11.921
-Yes.
-Tere, I'm Víctor.

11:12.463 --> 11:14.256
Juan Carlos's brother.

11:14.340 --> 11:15.675
-Oh…
-Juanqui.

11:15.758 --> 11:18.344
My brother's tied up at work.
He sent me instead.

11:18.886 --> 11:21.639
Sorry, you caught me off guard.
Nice to meet you.

11:21.722 --> 11:22.848
-You too.
-My pleasure.

11:22.932 --> 11:24.141
-Excuse me.
-Thank you.

11:24.225 --> 11:26.018
-A cup of wine, please.
-Sure.

11:26.102 --> 11:29.563
So, Juan told me you need help
setting up your business.

11:29.647 --> 11:32.233
So, here I am, tell me all about it.

11:33.776 --> 11:35.653
Oh, okay, great.

11:35.736 --> 11:36.987
Yes, look, my partner and I

11:37.071 --> 11:39.281
are opening a salon
with different services.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.659
Haircuts, dying, manicure, pedicure.

11:41.742 --> 11:46.997
But we want to specialize in microblading
and luxury facials.

11:47.081 --> 11:47.957
-Look.
-Okay.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.418
What are luxury facials?

11:50.501 --> 11:52.920
Exotic face masks, no one else has them.

11:53.003 --> 11:54.672
That would give us an edge.

11:54.755 --> 11:57.049
That's great. So, what about massages?

11:57.800 --> 12:00.177
It's not a bad idea.
I'm very good at massages.

12:00.261 --> 12:04.432
Really? I'd be a regular client,
I have a horrible sore muscle in my neck.

12:04.515 --> 12:05.349
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

12:05.433 --> 12:06.475
-May I?
-Yes.

12:06.559 --> 12:09.395
I can feel it, it's horrible.
You're stiff.

12:10.104 --> 12:12.189
Well, I don't know if you have the time,

12:12.273 --> 12:13.691
I could give you a massage.

12:13.774 --> 12:14.650
Here?

12:14.734 --> 12:16.986
No, not here, in my apartment.

12:18.446 --> 12:19.321
Okay.

12:22.950 --> 12:24.952
…squared minus P1.

12:25.035 --> 12:27.037
Minus VX times one…

12:27.121 --> 12:29.582
PABLO
I'M TUTORING CECI. WHERE ARE YOU?

12:29.665 --> 12:32.626
MARIANA
ABOUT TO MEET MY BIOLOGICAL FATHER.

12:32.710 --> 12:35.045
HE'S A MATHEMATICAL GENIUS.

12:35.129 --> 12:37.339
I'LL BE BACK LATER :)

12:37.423 --> 12:39.216
…just as any other equation.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.302
That's how precise math is.

12:42.261 --> 12:44.263
Thank you, see you next week.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.561
I never imagined
that story would lead to this.

12:53.314 --> 12:56.025
So, would you agree to a DNA test?

12:57.234 --> 12:58.152
Yes.

12:59.653 --> 13:00.529
It's just that…

13:01.030 --> 13:03.949
this is a lot to take in.

13:05.075 --> 13:07.036
Yes, I understand.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.831
So, you like math?

13:11.874 --> 13:13.501
I hate math.

13:14.376 --> 13:18.214
Why don't we move
to more interesting calculations?

13:19.089 --> 13:21.175
Like, at what age

13:21.258 --> 13:23.677
should one lose their virginity?

13:24.303 --> 13:25.971
I'd say around 17.

13:27.014 --> 13:29.475
I just turned 17, you know?

13:31.060 --> 13:32.895
Ceci, that's not a calculus problem.

13:34.063 --> 13:35.815
By my calculations, you're nervous.

13:35.898 --> 13:38.484
By my calculations,
you think you can do equations,

13:38.567 --> 13:39.944
but you can barely count.

13:40.903 --> 13:42.571
You think I'm privileged, right?

13:42.655 --> 13:43.656
I don't think so.

13:44.323 --> 13:45.616
I know you're privileged.

13:49.662 --> 13:50.871
How do you feel?

13:51.455 --> 13:52.706
I feel very…

13:54.333 --> 13:55.167
relaxed.

13:55.918 --> 13:56.794
And you?

13:57.837 --> 13:59.046
How do you feel?

14:00.965 --> 14:02.049
What's wrong with you?

14:02.132 --> 14:05.094
What? I'm just doing
what any man would do in this situation.

14:05.177 --> 14:06.512
-No!
-What?

14:06.595 --> 14:08.264
What situation?

14:08.347 --> 14:12.017
You had a deal with Juan Carlos,
I thought you'd have one with me--

14:12.101 --> 14:13.561
-Get out of my house.
-Tere…

14:13.644 --> 14:15.729
Yes, you got confused. Get out.

14:15.813 --> 14:16.647
Out!

14:17.273 --> 14:19.942
-What's wrong with you?
-I'm so sorry.

14:21.068 --> 14:22.319
How much do I owe you?

14:22.903 --> 14:24.154
Really? Get out, please.

14:24.238 --> 14:25.197
-Sorry.
-Out!

14:25.906 --> 14:27.366
Why are you so mad?

14:27.449 --> 14:29.910
-I sent my brother to help you.
-You're so cynical!

14:29.994 --> 14:32.454
-Is this your way of helping me?
-Come on…

14:32.538 --> 14:33.747
Tell me what happened.

14:33.831 --> 14:38.210
You had no right to tell
your stupid brother about us.

14:38.294 --> 14:41.589
Especially not so he'd
treat me like a prostitute!

14:46.468 --> 14:47.845
Are you gay or not?

14:48.429 --> 14:51.682
I don't know.
Elena is the first girl I've dated.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.811
I think you should become fully gay.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.188
Leave Pablo and stay with Elena.

14:58.272 --> 15:00.482
You'd be happier that way. I assure you.

15:06.614 --> 15:07.948
You look amazing.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.537
She's getting ready for Elena.

15:15.372 --> 15:19.585
Hey, no. I dressed up
because this is my first night out.

15:19.668 --> 15:21.420
To be honest, I want to feel good.

15:23.505 --> 15:24.882
Do I look like a cow?

15:24.965 --> 15:27.551
If all cows looked like that,

15:27.635 --> 15:28.677
I'd be a cowboy by now.

15:30.804 --> 15:32.932
Child, Olivia is here.

15:33.015 --> 15:34.058
Thanks, Alta.

15:34.975 --> 15:36.018
Well, Pablo…

15:36.518 --> 15:38.646
I'll leave you with the happy cow.

15:39.438 --> 15:41.440
I'm kidding, Mariana, you look great.

15:45.027 --> 15:46.153
Oh, all right.

15:46.987 --> 15:49.114
Thanks for taking care of Regina.

15:50.157 --> 15:51.575
It's your first night out.

15:51.659 --> 15:54.203
That's what we're here for,
to support each other.

15:55.245 --> 15:56.538
Another point in my favor?

16:00.668 --> 16:01.752
Oh, baby.

16:01.835 --> 16:03.003
Bye, sweetie.

16:03.087 --> 16:04.088
Thank you.

16:04.171 --> 16:05.005
Bye.

16:07.007 --> 16:08.342
Are you still here?

16:08.425 --> 16:10.594
Won't you go to the dinner?
Everyone's there.

16:11.178 --> 16:12.054
What dinner?

16:13.555 --> 16:14.765
You weren't invited.

16:15.683 --> 16:18.352
I don't think
it's an important gathering anyway.

16:18.435 --> 16:19.645
Who's going?

16:19.728 --> 16:22.272
The board members and senior officers.

16:22.356 --> 16:23.983
But anyway, ciao mamma.

16:27.945 --> 16:29.947
Cynthia… come here.

16:32.074 --> 16:35.160
Bring me the pants and blouse
I have in case of emergency.

16:35.244 --> 16:37.579
And find out
what restaurant Manolo's going to.

16:37.663 --> 16:38.580
Go!

16:43.085 --> 16:44.294
You needed to see me?

16:44.378 --> 16:46.922
What the hell did you do
to Teresa, you cynical ass?

16:47.006 --> 16:48.340
I didn't do anything, okay?

16:48.424 --> 16:51.510
You were supposed to help her,
not take advantage of her.

16:51.593 --> 16:54.346
It was a misunderstanding.
She said she'd give me a massage.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.558
We went to her apartment and… that's all.

16:57.641 --> 17:00.811
Besides, if you're getting rid of her,
you shouldn't care.

17:05.190 --> 17:08.027
Dammit, Juan Carlos, you care.

17:11.405 --> 17:13.657
-I told you, man.
-Shut up, asshole.

17:13.741 --> 17:14.575
Or else, what?

17:15.075 --> 17:16.160
You'll beat me up?

17:19.455 --> 17:20.956
You're screwed, Juanqui.

17:21.915 --> 17:24.001
You need to do something… and soon.

17:29.256 --> 17:32.217
I don't know if George told you,
but I'm learning Portuguese.

17:32.718 --> 17:34.428
That's interesting.

17:34.511 --> 17:38.265
We need more executives
who can speak Portuguese.

17:38.348 --> 17:40.350
My name is Manolo.

17:40.434 --> 17:43.353
I really like your country.

17:43.437 --> 17:44.646
It's impressive.

17:44.730 --> 17:45.773
Cheers.

17:47.357 --> 17:49.443
-Not bad.
-I'm still learning.

17:49.526 --> 17:50.527
Good evening.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.030
Sorry I'm late, but…

17:53.822 --> 17:55.532
I didn't get the invite.

17:55.616 --> 17:58.118
I'm sorry. I assumed
you'd be busy with the babies.

17:58.202 --> 17:59.536
Yes, yes.

17:59.620 --> 18:00.996
Don't worry.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.456
Good thing Manolo let me in.

18:03.957 --> 18:05.876
Matheus, it's so nice to see you.

18:05.959 --> 18:07.836
I'd like to talk to you.

18:08.837 --> 18:12.091
Brazil is going through
a political crisis.

18:12.174 --> 18:13.926
We must come up with new strategies.

18:14.009 --> 18:17.387
I hope you have time
to hear some of my ideas.

18:18.222 --> 18:19.556
I'm glad you came.

18:53.257 --> 18:54.550
Congratulations.

18:54.633 --> 18:56.969
That was fucking cool, dude!

18:57.553 --> 19:00.764
You're super talented too.
Well, you all are. Amazing!

19:00.848 --> 19:04.059
What matters up there
is feeling what you play. Right, Elena?

19:05.811 --> 19:07.396
I'll go get a drink.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.192
Oh, I need a drink.

19:12.860 --> 19:15.946
It's really hard to consider
women for senior positions.

19:16.029 --> 19:17.781
There are some exceptions here.

19:17.865 --> 19:19.283
What do you mean?

19:19.366 --> 19:21.910
Well, you are a woman,
but you're also brilliant.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.204
That's a hard combo to find.

19:24.288 --> 19:25.664
Well, I know a few.

19:25.747 --> 19:29.835
Maybe, but hiring them
poses a significant risk.

19:30.335 --> 19:34.590
If they get pregnant, we have to pay
for maternity leave and temps.

19:35.215 --> 19:38.010
And once they come back,
their productivity takes a dive.

19:38.093 --> 19:40.888
Need I remind you I closed a huge deal

19:40.971 --> 19:43.015
the day I gave birth
to my lovely daughter?

19:43.098 --> 19:45.517
Which proves women are not just capable,

19:45.601 --> 19:48.312
but that we can excel
at several things at once.

19:48.812 --> 19:51.231
Well, I've always preferred
working with women.

19:51.315 --> 19:53.400
They have prettier legs.

19:55.569 --> 19:57.196
Quite a sexist remark.

19:57.279 --> 20:00.657
Yet another problem with working
with women. No sense of humor.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.286
Ana, please, don't take this personal.

20:04.369 --> 20:07.164
How could I not?
I'm everything he mentioned.

20:07.247 --> 20:09.708
I'm a mom, a woman and an executive.

20:10.417 --> 20:12.544
And you're not helping me

20:12.628 --> 20:15.005
educate these chauvinist men?

20:15.088 --> 20:17.758
Don't drag me into it.
I chose not to have kids.

20:17.841 --> 20:20.886
I'm destined for something greater
than changing diapers.

20:20.969 --> 20:22.554
Oh, oh, okay.

20:23.305 --> 20:25.224
If you'll excuse me, gentlemen.

20:25.307 --> 20:28.185
I am one of those lame women
who have to go change diapers.

20:28.810 --> 20:29.853
But of course…

20:30.354 --> 20:31.939
with very beautiful legs.

20:32.022 --> 20:33.690
-Ana.
-Have a great night.

20:33.774 --> 20:34.942
Good night.

20:35.025 --> 20:36.568
Why the attitude?

20:36.652 --> 20:38.278
Because you're toxic.

20:38.362 --> 20:39.738
You don't even know me.

20:39.821 --> 20:42.407
Fake lesbians like you are all assholes,

20:42.491 --> 20:43.825
mean and full of shit.

20:43.909 --> 20:46.161
Well, real lesbians can also be assholes.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.705
Let me explain
why I think you're full of shit.

20:49.206 --> 20:51.625
You didn't care
about breaking Elena's heart.

21:08.141 --> 21:09.351
You spilled your drink.

21:31.748 --> 21:32.916
Tell me the truth, Elena.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.293
Don't you like me?

21:35.252 --> 21:37.421
Come on, of course I like you.

22:06.366 --> 22:07.868
Fuck!

22:07.951 --> 22:09.953
The fake lesbian was spying on us!

22:31.475 --> 22:32.517
Hey! Come here.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.521
Oh, I knew I'd find you here.

22:37.981 --> 22:39.149
What is it?

22:39.858 --> 22:42.277
-Are you okay?
-Yes. Everything's fine.

22:42.778 --> 22:45.906
Someone just called me
a fake lesbian tease.

22:46.656 --> 22:48.617
But other than that, I'm great.

22:48.700 --> 22:51.203
Well, I just had dinner
with some sexist dickheads.

22:52.621 --> 22:54.581
As if being a mom were an insult.

22:55.874 --> 22:56.708
You know?

22:57.250 --> 23:00.337
We should make a scene
and reclaim our rights.

23:00.420 --> 23:01.463
Yes, we should.

23:02.964 --> 23:04.299
We really should.

23:30.117 --> 23:31.535
I'm really worried.

23:31.618 --> 23:32.744
Why?

23:32.828 --> 23:34.788
Juan Carlos wants me out of his house.

23:36.665 --> 23:38.875
Really? How do you know? Did he tell you?

23:38.959 --> 23:41.628
No, he told Ana,
but I don't understand why.

23:42.129 --> 23:45.424
Ana is only asking for two months,
until Valentina is weaned.

23:47.342 --> 23:49.219
Well, yes. Beats me.

23:50.720 --> 23:51.680
It's weird.

23:52.264 --> 23:54.141
YOUR TEST RESULTS ARE IN YOUR INBOX.

23:54.224 --> 23:57.018
THANK YOU FOR CHOOSING US.
CURIE LABORATORIES.

23:57.102 --> 23:59.479
NEGATIVE MATCH

24:00.188 --> 24:01.022
What's wrong?

24:02.816 --> 24:05.610
Nothing, just some paternity test results.

24:05.694 --> 24:08.447
You asked Pablo for a paternity test?

24:08.530 --> 24:10.449
No, actually, I asked all your ex-lovers.

24:12.200 --> 24:16.371
Yeah, from a guy called Esteban
all the way to Mariano.

24:17.164 --> 24:19.124
But it turns out neither one is my dad.

24:20.625 --> 24:24.045
What gives you the right
to invade my privacy and my past?

24:24.129 --> 24:25.964
Why are you digging around my business?

24:26.047 --> 24:28.383
Well, FYI, your past is my past too.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.802
I won't leave it alone
until you tell me the truth.

24:31.970 --> 24:33.346
So, you want to meet your dad?

24:35.891 --> 24:38.101
Grab your stuff, let's put an end to this.

24:39.811 --> 24:40.729
Come on!

24:50.322 --> 24:51.156
Here?

24:52.741 --> 24:53.575
Are you sure?

24:53.658 --> 24:57.287
No. Hurry up and knock
before I chicken out and run.

25:14.429 --> 25:15.263
What do you want?

25:18.225 --> 25:19.809
I told you not to come here.

25:21.478 --> 25:22.395
I'm pregnant.

25:23.188 --> 25:24.564
Well, congratulations.

25:26.107 --> 25:27.234
It's yours.

25:29.402 --> 25:31.988
What? Do I look like I'm stupid?

25:32.781 --> 25:36.034
God knows how many guys you've slept with.

25:37.244 --> 25:39.329
But you're not pinning that baby on me.

25:39.412 --> 25:41.706
Hey, do you have a problem?

25:43.375 --> 25:46.002
Now, both of you,
get the fuck out of here!

25:46.086 --> 25:47.128
Let's go, Anuar.

25:58.014 --> 26:00.058
-Can I help you?
-Yes.

26:00.141 --> 26:02.477
I want you to meet your daughter, Raúl.

26:03.395 --> 26:04.229
Hello.

26:06.273 --> 26:09.359
I'll tell you the same thing
I told you 20 years ago.

26:09.859 --> 26:11.194
This brat isn't my daughter.

26:11.278 --> 26:14.114
God knows how many fuckers you slept with.

26:14.990 --> 26:16.700
You won't get a cent from me.

26:17.409 --> 26:18.451
No, no.

26:19.619 --> 26:21.121
We want nothing from you.

26:21.204 --> 26:23.290
I just wanted to meet you.

26:24.082 --> 26:25.792
You know what? You're right.

26:25.875 --> 26:28.587
I couldn't be the daughter
of an arrogant bastard like you.

26:28.670 --> 26:30.755
Really? Attack! Go on!

26:33.425 --> 26:35.176
Mariana! Wait.

26:36.177 --> 26:37.762
The keys, get your keys.

26:38.430 --> 26:39.264
Go on.

26:40.807 --> 26:43.977
Here's one
for all you've done to me, motherfucker!

26:45.520 --> 26:46.479
Run!

26:47.272 --> 26:50.191
-Ana, here's a list of questions.
-Yeah.

26:50.275 --> 26:52.611
-Tell me what you think.
-All right.

26:58.533 --> 26:59.367
Ana…

27:00.744 --> 27:04.039
what are your babies
and all these people doing here?

27:04.122 --> 27:05.874
-Jorge, how are you?
-Fine.

27:05.957 --> 27:07.751
Look, this is Lorenza.

27:07.834 --> 27:10.253
This is Jorge Benítez, my boss.

27:10.337 --> 27:12.547
He's the champion behind all this.

27:12.631 --> 27:15.508
You should take
the chance to interview him.

27:16.885 --> 27:18.595
Of course, Jorge.

27:19.095 --> 27:21.723
-Hello, Lorenza, nice to meet you.
-Hi, nice to meet you.

27:21.806 --> 27:23.475
But interview me? Why?

27:23.558 --> 27:26.061
Don't be modest, Jorge.

27:26.144 --> 27:27.604
Ana told me you've promoted

27:27.687 --> 27:30.774
innovative gender-equality policies
within the company.

27:32.150 --> 27:36.571
And you've placed women
in leadership positions.

27:37.364 --> 27:38.865
Tell us all about it, Jorge.

27:38.948 --> 27:40.367
Please, have a seat.

27:41.284 --> 27:43.995
-I can call you Jorge, right?
-Yes, sure.

27:44.079 --> 27:47.332
There's nothing sexier
than a man who respects women.

27:47.415 --> 27:48.416
Thank you.

27:49.125 --> 27:49.959
Tell us.

27:52.504 --> 27:54.005
He was my high school teacher.

27:56.299 --> 27:57.550
I was dazzled by him.

28:00.470 --> 28:02.430
But he turned out to be a jerk.

28:04.182 --> 28:07.811
Anuar was my best friend,
he offered to help me raise you.

28:11.606 --> 28:15.860
The fighting drove us apart
when you were still little.

28:20.281 --> 28:23.576
Forgive me, honey,
I know I should've told you before.

28:24.327 --> 28:25.370
It's okay, Mom.

28:27.122 --> 28:28.957
You were trying to protect me.

28:29.708 --> 28:30.750
Yeah.

28:36.214 --> 28:37.257
My girl.

28:43.388 --> 28:44.556
Don't you want to work?

28:45.056 --> 28:45.890
No.

28:47.809 --> 28:50.061
I'm overwhelmed. Too much crap lately.

28:50.895 --> 28:52.772
It turns out my dad's a jerk.

28:53.314 --> 28:55.066
Juan Carlos wants to kick me out,

28:55.150 --> 28:57.819
and Elena's friends
treated me like shit, man.

29:03.575 --> 29:05.994
For what it's worth…

29:07.245 --> 29:08.246
I love you.

29:09.789 --> 29:10.623
A lot.

29:15.879 --> 29:17.922
What? Why did you do that?

29:20.049 --> 29:22.844
Sorry, dude.
You're the queen of mixed signals.

29:23.428 --> 29:24.387
-Me?
-Yeah.

29:24.471 --> 29:26.264
But I've always been clear.

29:26.347 --> 29:27.265
Clear?

29:28.475 --> 29:31.060
Sorry, but you want the world
to revolve around you.

29:31.144 --> 29:32.103
And that's not cool.

29:38.735 --> 29:39.819
We need to talk.

29:39.903 --> 29:43.281
-No, I don't want to see you, go away.
-No, Teresa, just listen to me.

29:43.364 --> 29:46.034
I know what my brother did.
I had no idea, he's an asshole!

29:46.117 --> 29:47.994
-You told him about us.
-Wait.

29:48.077 --> 29:51.790
Because he showed me the app
where I met you, that's why.

29:51.873 --> 29:53.124
I'm nothing like him.

29:53.208 --> 29:56.085
If you didn't want to help me,
you could've given Ana an excuse.

29:56.169 --> 29:58.004
-It's that simple.
-I wanted to help you.

29:58.087 --> 30:00.006
Sending your brother in your place?

30:00.089 --> 30:03.051
Ever since I saw you again,
I realized I can't be near you.

30:11.142 --> 30:12.560
No, okay, yes.

30:18.483 --> 30:20.151
Wait, no, no.

30:20.235 --> 30:21.361
No, stop!

30:22.862 --> 30:25.073
This can't happen again.

30:27.617 --> 30:30.662
Tell Ana we're done
with the business plan.

30:30.745 --> 30:34.791
I'll find a way to pay you back,
but let's stop.

30:34.874 --> 30:37.293
Even if you pay me back,
we'll still see each other.

30:37.377 --> 30:39.295
Your daughter lives in my house.

30:39.379 --> 30:43.216
Teresa, please, convince Mariana 
to move back with you.

30:43.299 --> 30:44.175
How?

30:44.259 --> 30:47.470
Only Ana and Mariana can decide
when to leave their daughters.

30:49.556 --> 30:50.390
You know what?

30:55.603 --> 30:58.356
Everyone's priority should be the babies.

31:01.192 --> 31:02.652
You're right, I'm wrong.

31:19.294 --> 31:21.296
I came to apologize.

31:22.922 --> 31:27.760
No, Mariana, I should apologize
for the way Natalia treated you.

31:29.012 --> 31:31.306
I didn't know you had something with her.

31:32.599 --> 31:34.517
It's just a fling, that's all.

31:34.601 --> 31:36.394
But she's super jealous of you.

31:36.978 --> 31:38.479
Tell her she shouldn't be.

31:41.691 --> 31:43.484
I don't want to hurt you.

31:44.152 --> 31:47.530
Or send you mixed signals.

31:48.615 --> 31:51.075
And I don't want
to abuse what you are to me.

31:51.159 --> 31:52.702
What am I to you?

31:54.495 --> 31:56.789
Well… we're best friends, right?

31:59.417 --> 32:01.920
I don't want
to get in the way of your relationship.

32:04.380 --> 32:05.256
Ouch.

32:06.299 --> 32:07.675
I guess it's normal, huh?

32:07.759 --> 32:10.011
What I feel is what it must feel like

32:10.094 --> 32:12.680
to go from girlfriend
to friend, naturally.

32:16.142 --> 32:17.018
I'm sorry.

32:21.940 --> 32:24.233
Can I give you a hug
without it being confusing?

32:31.449 --> 32:33.076
Why don't you sit?

32:33.618 --> 32:36.371
Juan Carlos
won't like it if he sees me here.

32:36.454 --> 32:39.499
Come on, Mariana.
You're part of the family.

32:39.582 --> 32:40.416
-Sit down.
-No.

32:40.500 --> 32:43.336
Seriously, I don't want to be
a source of conflict.

32:43.419 --> 32:44.963
Why? What happened?

32:45.463 --> 32:47.715
Dad wants to kick Mariana
out of the house.

32:47.799 --> 32:48.716
No, no.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.719
Dad just thinks
it's time to go back to normal.

32:51.803 --> 32:53.930
But I don't want to go back to normal.

32:54.013 --> 32:56.140
-No, me neither.
-Neither do I, ma'am.

32:56.224 --> 32:57.183
Me neither.

32:59.811 --> 33:02.021
Mariana, you're more than welcome here.

33:02.105 --> 33:03.523
Please, sit down.

33:03.606 --> 33:06.526
What happened?
Why the sudden change of heart?

33:07.151 --> 33:10.071
I realized these girls are our priority.

33:11.364 --> 33:15.159
And, given the circumstances,
you two know what's best for them.

33:16.911 --> 33:19.956
If this is the new normal,
I'm willing to accept it.

33:23.543 --> 33:24.544
Thank you.

33:27.547 --> 33:28.548
Come here.

33:28.631 --> 33:30.925
Oh, look!

33:31.009 --> 33:32.969
-What?
-Look what I just got.

33:33.052 --> 33:35.138
-What is it?
-It's cool, right?

33:35.221 --> 33:36.639
MOTHER, EXECUTIVE, ENTREPRENEUR

33:36.723 --> 33:37.557
Amazing, Mom!

33:37.640 --> 33:40.601
-It is, right?
-I'll be the envy of all my enemies.

33:40.685 --> 33:41.728
Oh, I'm so happy!

33:42.478 --> 33:43.813
-What?
-Happy?

33:43.896 --> 33:45.773
-Yes.
-Oh, Ceci.

33:46.274 --> 33:47.358
What? It's true.

33:48.109 --> 33:49.318
You're admirable.

33:54.198 --> 33:55.366
Let's eat.

33:56.034 --> 33:59.203
-She's happy.
-She's so happy.

33:59.287 --> 34:01.330
What did I miss?

34:07.837 --> 34:09.922
Alta, pour me some wine, please.

34:12.967 --> 34:14.343
What year?

34:14.427 --> 34:15.887
I'm having dinner…

35:25.998 --> 35:29.001
