WEBVTT

00:10.411 --> 00:13.547
- RAY, WAKE UP.
RAY, WAKE UP.

00:13.581 --> 00:16.350
WAKE UP!
- THERE'S PUDDING EVERYWHERE.

00:20.488 --> 00:22.056
- RAY, I THINK
I HEAR SOMETHING.

00:23.324 --> 00:25.493
- DOES IT SOUND
LIKE YOU TALKING?

00:27.128 --> 00:29.530
- COME ON.
RAY, I'M SERIOUS.

00:29.563 --> 00:31.532
- ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.303
HOW COME I'M
THE NOISE CHECKER-OUTER?

00:35.336 --> 00:37.338
- BECAUSE IT WOULD LOOK
PATHETIC ON THE NEWS

00:37.371 --> 00:40.040
IF I WERE BEATEN UP
WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING.

00:41.342 --> 00:42.610
CAREFUL, HONEY,
IT COULD BE DANGEROUS.

00:42.643 --> 00:44.612
- YEAH.
- AND RAY--

00:44.645 --> 00:48.182
IF IT'S NOTHING DANGEROUS,
COULD YOU GET ME A YOGURT?

00:50.584 --> 00:52.220
- YEAH.

00:52.253 --> 00:56.056
- YOU KNOW, IN FACT,
GET ME A YOGURT EITHER WAY.

00:59.527 --> 01:00.594
- HI, I'M RAY,

01:00.628 --> 01:02.163
AND I LIVE HERE
IN LONG ISLAND

01:02.196 --> 01:03.597
WITH MY WIFE, DEBRA.

01:03.631 --> 01:04.865
SHE'S GREAT
WITH THE KIDS,

01:04.898 --> 01:07.201
THE HOUSE,
EVERYTHING.

01:07.235 --> 01:09.103
OH, I DON'T KNOW
HOW SHE DOES IT.

01:09.137 --> 01:10.604
WE'VE GOT A DAUGHTER,
ALLY,

01:10.638 --> 01:14.242
AND TWIN
TWO-YEAR-OLD BOYS.

01:14.275 --> 01:16.544
IT'S NOT REALLY
ABOUT THE KIDS.

01:16.577 --> 01:19.547
MY PARENTS LIVE
ACROSS THE STREET.

01:19.580 --> 01:20.881
THAT'S RIGHT,

01:20.914 --> 01:24.218
AND MY BROTHER
LIVES WITH THEM.

01:24.252 --> 01:25.153
NOW, NOT EVERY FAMILY

01:25.186 --> 01:27.321
WOULD GO BY
ON A CONVEYER BELT FOR YOU,

01:27.355 --> 01:29.223
BUT MINE WOULD,
BECAUSE--

01:29.257 --> 01:31.259
- EVERYBODY
LOVES RAYMOND.

01:31.292 --> 01:33.227
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

01:42.636 --> 01:43.837
HEY, NEMO.

01:43.871 --> 01:46.807
- HEY, THERE.
STEINBRENNER SUCKS.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.343
- THANKS FOR THE SCOOP.

01:49.377 --> 01:50.444
- HEY, COME HERE.

01:50.478 --> 01:51.679
I THOUGHT WE'D EAT AT
THE BOOTH TODAY.

01:51.712 --> 01:54.515
- WHY, ARE YOU
BREAKING UP WITH ME?

01:56.217 --> 01:57.651
- HA, HA, HA.
JUST SHUT UP AND SIT OVER THERE.

01:57.685 --> 02:00.488
COME ON, TRUST ME.

02:00.521 --> 02:02.122
YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED.

02:05.326 --> 02:07.795
AND WE HAVE LIFTOFF.

02:07.828 --> 02:08.896
- HI.

02:11.365 --> 02:12.333
SOMETHING TO DRINK FIRST?

02:12.366 --> 02:14.468
- UH--

02:14.502 --> 02:16.170
BEER.

02:16.204 --> 02:17.171
- IT'S A LITTLE EARLY.

02:17.205 --> 02:18.572
- I LIKE IT WITH PIZZA.

02:18.606 --> 02:20.708
BUT I DON'T KNOW, WHAT
DO YOU THINK I SHOULD HAVE?

02:20.741 --> 02:23.777
BECAUSE I'LL CHANGE IT.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.846
- I DRINK EIGHT GLASSES
OF WATER A DAY.

02:25.879 --> 02:27.881
- WATER.
I'LL HAVE WATER.

02:27.915 --> 02:30.251
PITCHER OF WATER.
- OKAY.

02:30.284 --> 02:32.186
AND YOU?
- YEAH, OKAY, WATER.

02:32.220 --> 02:33.821
I'LL JUST START
WITH A GLASS, THOUGH.

02:35.589 --> 02:37.591
AND THEN WHAT,
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE USUAL?

02:37.625 --> 02:41.429
- I JUST STARTED ON SATURDAY.
NOBODY HAS A USUAL YET.

02:43.331 --> 02:45.833
- IT'S FOUR SLICES,
EVERYTHING ON IT.

02:45.866 --> 02:47.768
- THAT SHOULD BE
AN OCCASIONAL.

02:47.801 --> 02:51.405
[Bernie laughs]

02:51.439 --> 02:53.874
- HOW ABOUT THAT?
THAT'S NEMO'S NIECE,

02:53.907 --> 02:55.976
ANGELINA.

02:56.009 --> 02:58.212
- I THINK SHE WAS STANDING
A LITTLE CLOSE.

02:58.246 --> 02:59.513
- MAN, LOOK AT HER.

02:59.547 --> 03:01.515
IF I WASN'T MARRIED,
YOU KNOW WHAT I'D DO?

03:01.549 --> 03:03.917
- WEAR THE SAME UNDERWEAR
EVERY DAY.

03:06.887 --> 03:09.490
- COME ON, RAY.
YOU DON'T THINK SHE'S HOT?

03:09.523 --> 03:10.924
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT,
SHE'S ALL RIGHT. RELAX.

03:10.958 --> 03:13.327
YOU'RE GOING
TO PULL A MUSCLE.

03:13.361 --> 03:14.828
- SHE'S ALL RIGHT?

03:14.862 --> 03:17.231
SHE'S BUILT LIKE THE LADY
FROM THE MUDFLAPS.

03:17.265 --> 03:18.966
- THE MUDFLAPS? WHAT?

03:18.999 --> 03:20.668
- YOU KNOW, THE LADY
YOU SEE ON THE TRUCKS.

03:20.701 --> 03:21.702
YOU KNOW, LIKE THIS.

03:21.735 --> 03:24.204
- DON'T YOU DO IT.

03:26.307 --> 03:28.008
- YOUR ORDER WILL BE UP
IN JUST ONE MINUTE.

03:28.041 --> 03:31.612
- OHH.
DID YOU SMELL HER?

03:31.645 --> 03:34.448
- NO, I--
I READ THE SIGN, BERNIE:

03:34.482 --> 03:36.684
"THANK YOU FOR NOT
SMELLING THE HELP."

03:38.552 --> 03:40.621
- YEP, HERE YOU GO.
- THANK YOU.

03:40.654 --> 03:42.856
- THANKS, ANGELINA.
THANK YOU. THANKS.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.425
ASK FOR PARMESAN.

03:44.458 --> 03:45.493
- NO.
- JUST GO AHEAD.

03:45.526 --> 03:46.494
- I DON'T WANT PARMESAN.
- ANGELINA?

03:46.527 --> 03:47.495
- YEAH?

03:47.528 --> 03:48.462
- RAY HERE WOULD LIKE

03:48.496 --> 03:50.264
JUST A SMIDGEN
OF GRATED PARMESAN, PLEASE.

03:50.298 --> 03:52.700
- OKAY.
- WAIT. A SMIDGEN?

03:52.733 --> 03:55.536
OH, YOU CAN'T
CONTROL YOURSELF, CAN YOU?

03:55.569 --> 03:57.438
- I CANNOT.

03:57.471 --> 03:59.006
- SAY WHEN.

04:17.991 --> 04:19.593
- WHEN.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.564
GIVE ME YOUR WATER.

04:25.733 --> 04:27.501
[telephone rings]

04:31.972 --> 04:33.941
- HELLO?

04:33.974 --> 04:36.344
YES, HE IS.
MAY I ASK WHO'S CALLING?

04:36.377 --> 04:37.878
OKAY, JUST A MINUTE.
ANGELINA.

04:37.911 --> 04:39.380
- ANGELINA?

04:42.049 --> 04:44.752
DON'T KNOW ANYONE
BY THAT NAME.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.888
- UH, DOES HE KNOW
WHAT THIS IS REGARDING?

04:47.921 --> 04:49.723
OKAY. YEAH.
THANKS FOR CALLING.

04:49.757 --> 04:51.058
BYE-BYE.

04:51.091 --> 04:52.059
SHE'S GOT YOUR WALLET.

04:52.092 --> 04:53.761
- MY--MY WALLET?

04:53.794 --> 04:55.896
- YEAH.
IT'S AT NEMO'S.

04:55.929 --> 04:58.031
- I DIDN'T GO TO NEMO'S.

05:03.003 --> 05:06.039
- WELL, YOUR WALLET
MADE IT THERE SOMEHOW.

05:06.073 --> 05:07.708
DO YOU HAVE YOUR WALLET?

05:09.810 --> 05:12.780
RAY, SHE SAID
SHE JUST WAITED ON YOU.

05:12.813 --> 05:15.983
- OH, NEMO'S. NEMO'S.
YEAH, YEAH.

05:16.016 --> 05:18.586
THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
A WAITRESS OVER THERE, YEAH.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.421
EVEN THOUGH WE USUALLY
GO TO THE COUNTER.

05:20.454 --> 05:23.391
BUT TODAY, NEMO,
HE FORCED US INTO THIS TABLE,

05:23.424 --> 05:25.759
WHERE THE WAITRESSES GO.

05:25.793 --> 05:27.027
SO WE HAD TO
HAVE A WAITRESS--

05:27.060 --> 05:29.830
NOT "HAVE" A WAITRESS.

05:29.863 --> 05:32.766
WE HAD, UH,
WAITRESS SERVICE.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.802
- SO HOW PRETTY IS SHE?

05:34.835 --> 05:36.470
- I DIDN'T SAY
SHE WAS PRETTY.

05:36.504 --> 05:38.472
- YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO.

05:38.506 --> 05:40.474
YOU'RE BEING
SO DEFENSIVE ABOUT IT.

05:40.508 --> 05:42.876
MY GOSH, YOU'D THINK
SOMETHING WAS GOING ON.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.845
- HA, HA, HA, HA, HA.

05:44.878 --> 05:47.981
HA, HA, HA.

05:48.015 --> 05:50.984
AH!
HA, HA, HA, HA.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.853
NO, NO, NO, NO.

05:52.886 --> 05:56.056
NO, NO, NO.

05:56.089 --> 05:58.158
- YOU'RE A FREAK.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.661
- WHAT? WHAT DID I DO?
WHAT DID I DO?

06:00.694 --> 06:01.729
- OH, COME ON,
CAN'T YOU BE HONEST?

06:01.762 --> 06:04.131
I MEAN, LOOK, RAY,
IF YOU SAW SOMEONE PRETTY TODAY,

06:04.164 --> 06:05.132
YOU CAN TELL ME.

06:05.165 --> 06:06.800
- I SAW NOTHING.

06:06.834 --> 06:09.570
- OH, WOW!
SHE MUST BE BEAUTIFUL.

06:09.603 --> 06:11.171
- LOOK,
SHE'S NEMO'S NIECE.

06:11.204 --> 06:14.074
HOW BEAUTIFUL
CAN SHE BE, HUH?

06:14.107 --> 06:16.744
YOU'VE SEEN NEMO.

06:16.777 --> 06:20.047
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, SOME MEN
MIGHT FIND HER ATTRACTIVE.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.516
NOTHING LIKE YOU, THOUGH.

06:22.550 --> 06:23.851
THAT--

06:23.884 --> 06:27.655
WHICH MEANS THAT YOU ARE
THE MORE ATTRACTIVE ONE.

06:27.688 --> 06:31.459
I--I HAVE THE RIGHT
TO AN ATTORNEY.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.600
- OKAY, SO SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.469
THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO KNOW.
NO BIG DEAL.

06:41.502 --> 06:45.506
- ALL RIGHT, GOOD.
SO IT'S OVER, DONE.

06:45.539 --> 06:47.174
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT'S FOR DINNER?

06:47.207 --> 06:48.642
- LASAGNA.

06:48.676 --> 06:50.711
- AHA.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.145
- SO WOULD YOU SLEEP WITH HER
IF WE WEREN'T MARRIED?

06:52.179 --> 06:53.981
- OH, WHAT?
NO!

06:54.014 --> 06:56.183
NO. NO, NO.

06:56.216 --> 06:58.719
- LET'S JUST PRETEND
I DIDN'T EXIST.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.489
- I DON'T LIKE THIS RIDE.
IT'S SCARY.

07:03.691 --> 07:05.526
- WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF?

07:19.740 --> 07:21.509
- LOOK,
IF YOU DIDN'T EXIST,

07:21.542 --> 07:24.812
I'D NEVER MEET ANOTHER WOMAN,
BECAUSE I'D BE A SAILOR.

07:24.845 --> 07:26.046
I'D SAIL.

07:26.079 --> 07:28.716
I'D JUST SAIL
AROUND THE WORLD BY MYSELF,

07:28.749 --> 07:32.019
MARRIED TO THE SALT
AND THE SEA.

07:32.052 --> 07:34.888
- OH, MAN, OKAY,
JUST FORGET IT.

07:34.922 --> 07:36.724
GOOD GRIEF,
I WAS JUST KIDDING.

07:36.757 --> 07:38.125
- ALL RIGHT.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.631
- OKAY, SO YOU'RE A SAILOR.

07:43.664 --> 07:45.165
YOU--YOU PULL INTO
THE PORT OF QUEENS

07:45.198 --> 07:47.100
TO--
TO TAKE ON SUPPLIES,

07:47.134 --> 07:49.703
AND YOU GO ASHORE
TO NEMO'S.

07:49.737 --> 07:52.272
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE LONELY
FROM THIS LONG JOURNEY,

07:52.305 --> 07:55.208
AND YOU COME UPON
THIS LOVELY PIZZA WENCH.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.946
WOULD YOU
SLEEP WITH HER?

08:00.548 --> 08:01.849
- YOU DON'T EXIST?

08:01.882 --> 08:03.150
- IT'S LIKE
"IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE."

08:03.183 --> 08:05.686
THERE'S NO DEBRA.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.821
- WELL, THEN IT'S NOT
A WONDERFUL LIFE, IS IT?

08:07.855 --> 08:09.857
- OH, HA, HA.

08:17.230 --> 08:20.000
- HOW MANY MONTHS
HAVE I BEEN AT SEA?

08:20.033 --> 08:21.902
- MMM, SEVEN.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.604
- AND THERE'S NO WIND,
THERE'S NOTHING.

08:23.637 --> 08:25.272
I'M JUST STUCK THERE
FOR A LONG TIME?

08:25.305 --> 08:29.543
- NO ME, NO WIND,
STUCK ON SHORE.

08:29.577 --> 08:32.880
- WELL, THEN,
SURE, YEAH.

08:32.913 --> 08:35.315
I GUESS SO.

08:35.348 --> 08:38.986
BREAK OUT THE FUNKY
COLD MEDINA.

08:45.659 --> 08:47.695
- I'LL TAKE THAT
AS A YES.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.163
- OKAY?

08:50.197 --> 08:51.599
- YEP, SURE.
FINE.

08:51.632 --> 08:52.432
- OKAY, GOOD.

08:52.465 --> 08:53.934
SO, WHAT KIND--
WHAT KIND OF SAUCE?

08:53.967 --> 08:55.202
MEAT SAUCE OR--

08:58.939 --> 09:02.542
OR SHOULD I JUST EAT
OUT OF A BOWL ON THE PORCH?

09:04.011 --> 09:05.846
YOU DIDN'T EXIST!

09:11.284 --> 09:12.319
- YOU SURE
YOU AREN'T HUNGRY?

09:12.352 --> 09:13.286
- OH, NO, NO, NO.

09:13.320 --> 09:16.724
- HEY, RAY, DOES THIS
SMELL FUNNY TO YOU?

09:17.991 --> 09:20.828
- YEAH. YEAH.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.830
- OKAY, NO CHARGE.

09:27.635 --> 09:30.037
- LOOK, I'M HERE TO GET
MY WALLET, THAT'S IT.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.038
I'M JUST
GETTING MY WALLET.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.272
YOU'RE MY WITNESS.

09:35.308 --> 09:37.010
- YOU HUNGRY YET?

09:37.044 --> 09:38.211
- NO, NO, NO.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.012
- THEN JUST COME
SIT WITH ME.

09:39.046 --> 09:40.313
COME ON.
COME ON.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.685
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING
SO GUILTY ABOUT?

09:44.718 --> 09:47.187
- THAT'S MY NATURAL LOOK.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.388
- LOOK, LIGHTEN UP, RAY.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.891
YOU DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.392
- LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, BERNIE.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.962
THIS HAS BEEN
BOTHERING ME.

09:54.995 --> 09:59.667
I DID NOT NEED
THAT MUCH PARMESAN CHEESE.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.341
- HI.
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

10:08.375 --> 10:09.877
- YOU ARE?

10:09.910 --> 10:11.845
- HERE YOU GO.

10:11.879 --> 10:15.415
YOU GOT CUTE KIDS THERE.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.416
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

10:16.449 --> 10:17.384
- OH, MAN,
YOU ARE GOLDEN.

10:17.417 --> 10:19.119
YOU KNOW
WHO SHE SMELLS LIKE?

10:19.152 --> 10:21.221
DO YOU REMEMBER CARLA DEMECO
FROM HIGH SCHOOL?

10:21.254 --> 10:24.024
- OH, YEAH.
CARLA DEMECO.

10:24.057 --> 10:26.193
SHE SMELLED
LIKE VANILLA--

10:26.226 --> 10:28.095
AND--AND APPLE,

10:28.128 --> 10:29.429
AND STRAWBERRY.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.363
YOU KNOW WHAT
SHE WAS LIKE?

10:30.397 --> 10:34.201
THE SYRUP CADDIE
AT THE HOUSE OF PANCAKES.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.670
- LET'S GO THERE LATER.

10:36.704 --> 10:39.840
- HELLO, LADIES.
- HEY!

10:39.873 --> 10:41.008
- DAD, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

10:41.041 --> 10:43.677
- HEY, LET ME IN.

10:43.711 --> 10:45.012
- DAD, WHY ARE YOU HERE?

10:45.045 --> 10:46.046
- HEE, HEE, HEE.

10:46.079 --> 10:48.716
I CAME TO SEE
THE NEW WAITRESS.

10:48.749 --> 10:51.218
- OH, GOD, DAD!

10:51.251 --> 10:54.354
- HEY, RELAX.
I'M HAVING LUNCH.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.857
- HI, WILL YOU
BE JOINING THEM?

10:56.890 --> 11:00.160
- HOLY CRAP!

11:00.193 --> 11:02.696
UH, UH, YES, YES, I WILL.
THANK YOU.

11:02.730 --> 11:04.097
- OKAY.

11:04.131 --> 11:05.733
WHAT CAN I GET FOR YOU?

11:05.766 --> 11:08.468
- I'LL HAVE A MEATBALL
SANDWICH, DEAR.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.370
- AND TO DRINK?

11:10.403 --> 11:14.307
- A NON-ALCOHOLIC BEER,
S'IL VOUS PLAIT.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.343
- I THINK SHE'S GOT A LITTLE
CRUSH ON YOUR BOY HERE.

11:16.376 --> 11:18.078
- HEY, YOU BETTER
WATCH IT.

11:18.111 --> 11:20.347
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
DOES DEBRA KNOW?

11:20.380 --> 11:22.182
- WHAT?
THERE'S NOTHING TO KNOW.

11:22.215 --> 11:23.416
- RAY LEFT HIS WALLET
HERE YESTERDAY,

11:23.450 --> 11:24.251
AND WHEN ANGELINA FOUND IT,

11:24.284 --> 11:26.319
SHE CALLED THE HOUSE
LOOKING FOR RAY.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.188
- JEEZ-ALOO!

11:28.221 --> 11:30.090
HEY, YOU DENIED
NOTICING HER, RIGHT?

11:30.123 --> 11:32.726
- I TRIED, BUT DEBRA CAN TELL
WHEN I'M LYING.

11:32.760 --> 11:35.195
THEN WE HAD TO DISCUSS IT.

11:35.228 --> 11:37.364
- YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
MESSING WITH HERE, DO YOU?

11:37.397 --> 11:39.432
YOU COULD GET HIT
BY THE THUNDERBOLT.

11:39.466 --> 11:40.433
- WHAT'S THAT?

11:40.467 --> 11:42.002
- THE THUNDERBOLT.

11:42.035 --> 11:46.273
YOU SEE SOMEBODY, AND THEN--
BA-BOOM!

11:46.306 --> 11:50.410
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,
YOU'RE IN BIG TROUBLE.

11:50.443 --> 11:52.012
IT'S IN YOUR BLOOD.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.347
- ALL RIGHT.
- I CAN'T GO INTO DETAIL.

11:55.849 --> 11:59.219
- HERE YOU GO,
LARGE MEATBALL.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.922
- THAT'S WHAT
WE CALL HIM AT HOME.

12:01.955 --> 12:04.391
- HOW ABOUT YOU?
DO YOU NEED ANYTHING?

12:04.424 --> 12:05.458
- [raspy voice]
NO.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.763
- YOU SEE?
YOU SEE?

12:09.797 --> 12:11.398
- YOU BETTER WATCH IT.
- I REALLY DIDN'T--

12:11.431 --> 12:12.833
- UNTIL YOU LEARN TO
KEEP A POKER FACE,

12:12.866 --> 12:14.868
YOU DON'T COME IN HERE
ANYMORE.

12:14.902 --> 12:16.837
YOU'RE OFF NEMO'S.
JUST FORGET ABOUT IT.

12:16.870 --> 12:19.439
NO MORE PIZZA,
YOU UNDERSTAND?

12:19.472 --> 12:21.909
UH, SWEETHEART?
- YEAH?

12:21.942 --> 12:24.878
- COULD I HAVE A LITTLE
PARMESAN OVER HERE, PLEASE?

12:29.917 --> 12:31.084
- HELLO, DEAR.

12:31.118 --> 12:32.285
- WELL, HI.
HOW ARE YOU?

12:32.319 --> 12:34.154
- GOOD. GOOD.

12:34.187 --> 12:36.123
OH, WHERE ARE THE CHILDREN?

12:36.156 --> 12:38.358
- OH, I GOT THEM
PLUGGED IN.

12:38.391 --> 12:41.795
BARNEY'S IN CHARGE
FOR THE NEXT HALF HOUR.

12:41.829 --> 12:43.396
- WELL, ENJOY YOUR BREAK.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.232
YOU DESERVE IT, HONEY.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.566
I REMEMBER
BEFORE TELEVISION,

12:46.599 --> 12:49.236
WE ACTUALLY HAD TO BE
WITH THE KIDS.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.370
- HA, HA, HA, HA.

12:53.206 --> 12:56.143
- SO H-H-HOW YOU DOING?

12:56.176 --> 12:58.078
- I'M FINE.
WHY?

12:58.111 --> 12:59.479
- WELL, HAVE YOU BEEN
GETTING ENOUGH REST?

12:59.512 --> 13:02.182
'CAUSE YOU LOOK
A LITTLE TIRED.

13:02.215 --> 13:04.284
- WELL, OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD.

13:04.317 --> 13:06.353
- HA, HA, HA.
BOY.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.021
OH, BOY, HONEY, I KNOW.

13:08.055 --> 13:09.957
I'VE BEEN THERE.
HA, HA.

13:09.990 --> 13:12.025
HAVE YOU EVER
WONDERED WHY, UH,

13:12.059 --> 13:15.262
FRANK AND I HAVE
SUCH A GOOD RELATIONSHIP?

13:15.295 --> 13:16.930
- NO.

13:16.964 --> 13:20.934
- WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S BECAUSE
I KNOW THE IMPORTANCE

13:20.968 --> 13:23.136
OF KEEPING UP
MY APPEARANCE.

13:23.170 --> 13:24.571
HUH?

13:24.604 --> 13:27.107
HERE'S SOMETHING I USE

13:27.140 --> 13:29.977
FOR THOSE LITTLE WRINKLES
AROUND THE EYES.

13:30.010 --> 13:33.847
- MARIE, THIS IS
HEMORRHOID CREAM.

13:33.881 --> 13:38.351
- IT STINGS A LITTLE,
BUT IT REALLY WORKS, SEE?

13:38.385 --> 13:41.188
YOU MIGHT
WANT TO TRY IT.

13:41.221 --> 13:44.591
SO HOW ARE THINGS
BETWEEN YOU AND RAY?

13:44.624 --> 13:46.493
- WELL, I'M NOT SURE
WE NEED THIS.

13:46.526 --> 13:48.328
- OH. HA, HA, HA.

13:48.361 --> 13:51.064
WELL, YOU KNOW ME, DEBRA.

13:51.098 --> 13:54.434
I'M THE LAST PERSON
TO WANT TO CAUSE ANY TROUBLE.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.503
BUT, UH--

13:56.536 --> 13:59.272
I, UH,
I'VE HEARD SOME THINGS.

13:59.306 --> 14:01.341
- THINGS?

14:01.374 --> 14:05.578
MARIE, ALL RAY DID WAS
LEAVE HIS WALLET AT NEMO'S.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.514
- OOH, I SAID TOO MUCH.

14:07.547 --> 14:08.982
MAYBE I SHOULD GO.

14:09.016 --> 14:11.151
I WAS NEVER HERE.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.420
- MARIE, I'M NOT
WORRIED ABOUT RAY.

14:13.453 --> 14:15.355
- OH, I TRUST RAY TOO.

14:15.388 --> 14:18.491
I DON'T TRUST THAT
PIZZA PARLOR PUTTANA.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.027
HERE, A GIFT.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.261
- HEY!

14:21.294 --> 14:23.030
- HEY, MARIE,
WE'RE STARVING OVER THERE.

14:23.063 --> 14:25.999
- OKAY, OKAY.
GOOD LUCK, HONEY.

14:26.033 --> 14:28.368
- I DON'T NEED GOOD LUCK.

14:28.401 --> 14:30.938
THERE'S NOTHING
GOING ON, YOU KNOW?

14:30.971 --> 14:32.139
- MARIE, WHAT'S SHE
TALKING ABOUT?

14:32.172 --> 14:32.973
- NOTHING. NOTHING.

14:33.006 --> 14:35.375
WE WERE JUST HAVING
A DISCUSSION.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.410
- MARIE, YOU'RE KILLING ME
WITH YOUR YAPPER.

14:37.444 --> 14:40.047
- OH, NO,
IT'S NOT FOR YOU, DEAR.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.448
IT'S FOR DEBRA.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.083
- OH.

14:43.116 --> 14:44.251
SORRY.

14:54.727 --> 14:58.365
- YOU KNOW, I APPRECIATE
THE CONCERN, AND THE GIFT,

14:58.398 --> 15:02.002
BUT, YOU KNOW, I REALLY THINK
THIS IS BETWEEN RAY AND I.

15:02.035 --> 15:04.471
- OH, IS THIS ABOUT
RAYMOND AND THE TRAMP?

15:06.006 --> 15:07.941
- HEY, EVERYBODY.
- HEY.

15:07.975 --> 15:09.242
- HI, RAY.
- HEY, RAY.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.115
- I'M STARVING.

15:17.350 --> 15:20.087
WHAT--WHAT'S THAT
I SMELL THERE, MEAT LOAF?

15:20.120 --> 15:23.556
- YEAH, BUT, UM,
THAT'S FOR TOMORROW.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.925
I WAS THINKING WE COULD
GO TO NEMO'S TONIGHT.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.969
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

15:36.003 --> 15:38.371
- NOTHING; WE WERE
JUST HAVING A DISCUSSION.

15:38.405 --> 15:39.572
- OH, NO.

15:39.606 --> 15:40.740
- BUT IT'S OVER NOW,

15:40.773 --> 15:42.075
'CAUSE YOU'RE GOING
OUT TO DINNER.

15:42.109 --> 15:43.276
COME ON, LET'S GO.

15:48.248 --> 15:51.551
- OH, WHAT A TANGLED WEB
WE WEAVE.

15:59.192 --> 16:01.094
- YOU SURE THIS IS
A GOOD IDEA, HONEY?

16:01.128 --> 16:03.463
PIZZA COULD BE FATTENING.

16:03.496 --> 16:04.597
NOT THAT
YOU HAVE TO WORRY,

16:04.631 --> 16:06.199
NOT WITH YOUR GREAT FIGURE.

16:08.068 --> 16:09.269
OH--

16:09.302 --> 16:11.604
BOY, I CAN'T WAIT
TO GET YOU HOME.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.611
HEY, HEY, SUZY.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.313
UH, WE'RE READY--
WE'RE GOING TO ORDER RIGHT NOW.

16:20.347 --> 16:23.283
- OH, YOU BROUGHT
THE KIDS TONIGHT.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.451
I'M ON BREAK.

16:24.484 --> 16:25.485
- WAIT, WAIT--

16:25.518 --> 16:28.321
- ANGELINA, TABLE FOUR.

16:28.355 --> 16:29.422
- OH, HI, RAY.

16:29.456 --> 16:32.325
- OH, HI, UH, WAITRESS.

16:34.261 --> 16:36.663
OH, LOOK, KIDS, FIRE.

16:36.696 --> 16:39.232
- HI, I THINK WE SPOKE
ON THE PHONE EARLIER.

16:39.266 --> 16:41.401
I'M ANGELINA. HI.
- OH, HI.

16:41.434 --> 16:42.702
- I'M SORRY,
THAT WAS RUDE OF ME.

16:42.735 --> 16:45.605
THIS IS DEBRA,
THE LITTLE LADY.

16:45.638 --> 16:47.740
I DON'T MEAN LITTLE
IN A SIZE WAY

16:47.774 --> 16:49.709
OR LITTLE THAT
SHE DOESN'T MATTER.

16:49.742 --> 16:55.248
SHE'S MY BIG LADY.
SHE'S MY GREAT BIG LADY.

16:55.282 --> 16:56.783
- IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

16:56.816 --> 16:58.618
- YOU WANT YOUR USUAL?

16:58.651 --> 17:01.154
- HA, HA.
LIKE I HAVE A USUAL.

17:02.555 --> 17:05.125
- GO AHEAD, RAY,
JUST GET YOUR USUAL.

17:05.158 --> 17:08.795
- IT'S BERNIE'S.
IT'S BERNIE'S USUAL. UH--

17:08.828 --> 17:13.166
I'M GOING TO GO
WITH ITALIAN FOOD.

17:19.506 --> 17:23.643
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU,
MY BRIDE?

17:23.676 --> 17:26.513
- HA, HA, HA, HA.

17:26.546 --> 17:29.316
UH, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
A LARGE CHEESE PIZZA.

17:29.349 --> 17:30.517
I NEED THREE MILKS
FOR THE KIDS.

17:30.550 --> 17:31.484
I'LL HAVE A ROOT BEER,

17:31.518 --> 17:35.255
AND HE NEEDS SOMETHING
TO DRINK RIGHT AWAY.

17:35.288 --> 17:36.723
AND I'LL HAVE A SALAD,
THANKS.

17:36.756 --> 17:39.559
- OKAY. COMING RIGHT UP.
THANKS.

17:41.828 --> 17:43.463
- ALL RIGHT,
WELL, SHE IS PRETTY.

17:43.496 --> 17:45.332
I CAN SEE WHY YOU MADE
SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT HER.

17:45.365 --> 17:46.199
- ME?

17:46.233 --> 17:47.567
I DIDN'T MAKE
A BIG DEAL ABOUT HER.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.369
YOU DID; YOU MADE
THE BIG DEAL ABOUT HER.

17:49.402 --> 17:50.837
YEAH, YOU'RE THE ONE.

17:50.870 --> 17:52.372
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO PUT ME IN THE OCEAN

17:52.405 --> 17:54.307
AND KILLED YOURSELF.

17:54.341 --> 17:55.675
AND YOU KEPT ME OUT THERE
FOR SEVEN MONTHS,

17:55.708 --> 17:57.244
A LONELY SAILOR.

17:57.277 --> 17:58.411
YOU MADE ME DO IT.

17:58.445 --> 18:00.347
YOU MADE ME
SLEEP WITH HER.

18:00.380 --> 18:01.714
OH, HELLO.

18:03.316 --> 18:05.252
- DADDY'S SWEATING.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.688
- DO YOU MIND?

18:08.721 --> 18:11.458
- HELP HER.
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

18:15.195 --> 18:16.496
- OH, I FORGOT.

18:16.529 --> 18:17.297
YOU LIKE PARMESAN.

18:17.330 --> 18:20.433
- NO! NO, PARMESAN.
NO PARMESAN.

18:39.886 --> 18:42.155
UNLESS YOU WANT PARMESAN.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.628
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN THERE, HONEY?

18:48.661 --> 18:50.330
- NOTHING.
NOTHING.

18:51.931 --> 18:54.334
WOW!
THAT REALLY DOES STING.

18:57.537 --> 18:59.772
- LISTEN, I'M SORRY
ABOUT TONIGHT.

18:59.806 --> 19:02.275
I WAS A JERK.

19:02.309 --> 19:03.343
- JUST TELL ME
ONE THING, RAY.

19:03.376 --> 19:05.345
DO YOU WISH
I LOOKED LIKE ANGELINA?

19:05.378 --> 19:07.347
- NO, NO.

19:07.380 --> 19:08.848
OF COURSE NOT.

19:08.881 --> 19:10.783
HOW COULD I
TELL YOU APART?

19:13.320 --> 19:14.621
- WHAT IS IT WITH YOU GUYS?

19:14.654 --> 19:17.224
WHY IS IT WHEN ONE OF YOU
SEES A PRETTY GIRL,

19:17.257 --> 19:20.393
HE BECOMES A BASKET CASE?

19:20.427 --> 19:23.496
WHY IS HOW A WOMAN LOOKS
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING?

19:23.530 --> 19:25.565
- THAT'S GOD'S WAY.

19:25.598 --> 19:28.435
THAT'S WHY THE EYES
ARE IN FRONT.

19:28.468 --> 19:30.270
IF WHAT A WOMAN SAID
WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT,

19:30.303 --> 19:34.241
THEN THE EARS
WOULD BE HERE.

19:34.274 --> 19:35.608
THAT'S JUST
NATURAL SELECTION.

19:35.642 --> 19:39.346
THERE WERE GUYS LIKE THAT,
BUT THEY DIED OUT.

19:41.314 --> 19:43.750
- WELL, I JUST THOUGHT
YOU WERE DIFFERENT.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.918
- I AM DIFFERENT.

19:45.952 --> 19:48.555
I AM DIFFERENT.
I'M VERY SPECIAL.

19:48.588 --> 19:49.756
- OHH.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.792
- YOU KNOW THAT.

19:52.825 --> 19:57.129
HOW MANY MEN DO YOU KNOW
CAN DO THIS?

20:01.000 --> 20:04.471
[IMITATING BOMB FALLING]

20:04.504 --> 20:06.406
BOOM!

20:20.753 --> 20:23.490
- WHO ARE YOU?

20:23.523 --> 20:25.825
- COME ON, HUH--OW.

20:25.858 --> 20:27.760
THIS IS NO BIG DEAL.

20:27.794 --> 20:29.562
- YOU LOOKING AROUND
IS NOT A BIG DEAL?

20:29.596 --> 20:31.831
- I DIDN'T LOOK AROUND.
I LOOKED.

20:31.864 --> 20:34.634
I LOOKED, THAT'S ALL.
THERE'S NO "AROUND."

20:34.667 --> 20:37.370
AND THERE NEVER WILL BE.

20:37.404 --> 20:38.237
NOW, COME ON,

20:38.271 --> 20:39.806
I'M SURE YOU LOOK AROUND
ONCE IN A WHILE.

20:39.839 --> 20:41.574
- NO, WOMEN ARE--
WOMEN ARE DIFFERENT.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.710
- YEAH, YOU NEVER FOUND
ANOTHER GUY ATTRACTIVE?

20:43.743 --> 20:46.579
- NO.
- REALLY?

20:46.613 --> 20:47.814
- WELL--
- COME ON!

20:47.847 --> 20:49.816
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.

20:49.849 --> 20:51.784
OH, WELL, MAYBE.

20:51.818 --> 20:53.353
- WHO?

20:53.386 --> 20:57.457
WHO? WHO?
WHO DO YOU LOOK AT?

20:57.490 --> 20:58.591
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
IF IT HELPS,

20:58.625 --> 21:01.861
I'M DEAD,
AND YOU'RE A SAILOR.

21:01.894 --> 21:05.865
- OKAY, WELL,
THERE'S THAT CHUCK WILSON.

21:05.898 --> 21:08.368
- CHUCK WILSON?
AT MY PAPER?

21:08.401 --> 21:09.869
THE COLUMNIST?
- YEAH. YEAH.

21:09.902 --> 21:11.604
YOU KNOW, HIS PICTURE
IS RIGHT ACROSS FROM YOURS,

21:11.638 --> 21:13.873
AND, UH,
HE'S KIND OF CUTE.

21:13.906 --> 21:14.941
- WILSON?
- YEAH.

21:14.974 --> 21:18.711
- OH, GOD,
HE'S A FAT LOAD, WILSON.

21:18.745 --> 21:20.413
- WELL, HE DOESN'T LOOK FAT
IN HIS PICTURE.

21:20.447 --> 21:21.748
- THAT'S FROM THE HEAD UP.

21:21.781 --> 21:22.849
I'M TELLING YOU,

21:22.882 --> 21:25.385
FROM THE NECK DOWN,
HE'S A CARNIVAL.

21:25.418 --> 21:27.587
WILSON? GOD.

21:27.620 --> 21:28.588
