- (Dr. Pavlov grunts)
- Oh, hello, Dr. Pavlov.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.374
(announcer) "Sex&Drugs&Rock&Roll."

00:08.376 --> 00:10.743
<i>All new Thursdays</i>
<i>at 10:00 on FX.</i>

00:11.946 --> 00:14.646

"Tyrant."

00:18.953 --> 00:20.380
<i> Previously on</i>
"Tyrant"

00:20.380 --> 00:22.150
(Barry)<i> Starting as of</i>
<i> this moment, I am,</i>

00:22.356 --> 00:25.357
with the support of
the Abuddinian military,

00:25.359 --> 00:28.920
assuming the office
of President of Abuddin.

00:28.920 --> 00:30.729
(Al-Qadi)<i> Bassam is</i>
<i> promising us democracy.</i>

00:30.731 --> 00:32.998
<i> The same thing his brother</i>
<i> promised us a year ago.</i>

00:33.000 --> 00:34.830
Now one Al Fayeed
replaces another,

00:34.830 --> 00:36.201
and they call it progress.

00:36.203 --> 00:39.838
I'm talking about forming
a Truth and Dignity Commission.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.140
I'm gonna name you
the chair.

00:41.142 --> 00:42.240
(Leila)<i> I want to be</i>

00:42.240 --> 00:44.977
the first woman Foreign
Secretary of an Arab nation.

00:44.979 --> 00:46.540
That's what you'll be.

00:46.540 --> 00:48.213
Please, no, stop!

00:48.215 --> 00:51.016
(choking)

00:51.018 --> 00:52.985
If the elections were
held today, you would get

00:52.987 --> 00:54.486
72% of the vote.

00:54.488 --> 00:56.855
It would be a coronation,
of you.

00:56.857 --> 00:58.157
Tell us why
we should support that.

00:58.159 --> 00:59.925
I'm not running for President.

00:59.927 --> 01:02.190
Was this your plan all along,
to drop out of the election?

01:02.190 --> 01:03.630
The country needed reassurance.

01:03.630 --> 01:06.360
Now it needs a real election,
and that cannot happen

01:06.360 --> 01:07.833
<i>- if I run. </i>
- (Cogswell)<i> Exley.</i>

01:07.835 --> 01:10.230
(Sheik Abdullah)<i> The American has</i>
<i> taken power in Abuddin.</i>

01:10.230 --> 01:12.730
It is an opportunity
almost too good to be true

01:12.740 --> 01:13.906
if we play it right.

01:13.908 --> 01:16.008
(Fauzi)<i> There is no hope here
 anymore,</i>

01:16.010 --> 01:19.178
<i> only chaos or tyranny.</i>

01:19.180 --> 01:21.513
Do you believe in
what the Caliphate is doing?

01:21.515 --> 01:22.980
I don't actually care anymore.

01:22.980 --> 01:24.083
Stop!
(gunshot)

01:24.919 --> 01:25.818
(grunts)

01:27.288 --> 01:28.120
(screams)

01:28.120 --> 01:30.923
He and his whole family
are going to wish

01:30.925 --> 01:32.524
<i> that he had just let me die.</i>

01:32.526 --> 01:34.626
<i> I'm never going to forgive.</i>

01:45.039 --> 01:47.106
(indistinct chatter)

02:00.221 --> 02:02.054
I still need to
take a plaster cast

02:02.056 --> 02:03.222
to make the mold.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.590
Once the arm is
properly fitted,

02:04.592 --> 02:06.592
you'll be amazed
how well it works.

02:06.594 --> 02:08.127
(newswoman) This marks
Mrs. Al Fayeed's first visit

02:08.128 --> 02:09.895
to the war-torn region.

02:09.896 --> 02:11.396
The President is
committed to making sure...

02:11.490 --> 02:13.590
You'll be able to open
and close your fingers,

02:13.600 --> 02:16.160
even make a fist.

02:16.170 --> 02:18.700
They will be honored
for their sacrifice,

02:18.700 --> 02:20.430
and we are grateful
for their service.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.500
(exhales)

02:22.500 --> 02:25.710
Look at this bullshit
they keep spinning,

02:25.710 --> 02:28.110
in the comic books
and the propaganda.

02:30.050 --> 02:31.710
Can you give us
a minute, Doctor?

02:31.710 --> 02:35.880
The Al Fayeed bitch
is coming to Ma'an.

02:35.880 --> 02:36.950
(pounds table)

02:36.950 --> 02:38.620
Coming to my home.

02:41.090 --> 02:43.260
Wafiq has her driver.

02:43.260 --> 02:45.190
And his wife
 and their children.

02:45.190 --> 02:47.730
<i> He's given us</i>
<i> Mrs. Al Fayeed's itinerary:</i>

02:47.730 --> 02:51.600
<i> motorcade routes,</i>
<i> communication channels.</i>

02:55.770 --> 02:58.910
He's, uh, motivated
to deliver Mrs. Al Fayeed.

02:58.910 --> 03:00.970
Okay, then.

03:00.980 --> 03:04.210
You are trying to provoke
Bassam into a fight, yes?

03:04.210 --> 03:08.050
Let him watch me
 kill his wife.

03:08.050 --> 03:10.780
See how long he can
contain his rage.

03:12.420 --> 03:15.120
(Molly) My husband
has asked me to represent him

03:15.120 --> 03:18.630
not only as First Lady,
but also as a physician.

03:18.630 --> 03:20.230
(door closes)
(indistinct chatter)

03:20.230 --> 03:21.760
General Cogswell.

03:21.760 --> 03:23.230
Welcome back
to Abuddin.

03:23.230 --> 03:24.730
Mr. President.

03:24.730 --> 03:27.500
Thank you for allowing
me to do this in person,

03:27.500 --> 03:30.070
and thanks to Ms. Exley
for being the go-between.

03:30.840 --> 03:32.670
- Welcome.
- I don't think

03:32.680 --> 03:35.080
your agenda is much
of a mystery, General.

03:36.310 --> 03:37.780
Unfortunately, your brother

03:37.780 --> 03:40.620
allowed the capabilities
of the Abuddinian military

03:40.620 --> 03:43.450
to be severely... degraded.

03:43.450 --> 03:47.350
I bring to you a very generous
offer of an aid package.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.620
Money, machines,
boots on the ground,

03:49.630 --> 03:51.860
and I'm talking
2,000 to 3,000 troops.

03:51.860 --> 03:53.830
Training to rebuild
so that you have

03:53.830 --> 03:55.600
the capabilities
to protect yourself

03:55.600 --> 03:58.870
against threats both
foreign and domestic.

03:58.870 --> 04:00.700
And, of course,

04:00.700 --> 04:02.800
uh, we will stay
as long as you need us.

04:02.800 --> 04:04.600
Or is that
the other way around?

04:04.610 --> 04:06.040
Well, we want an ally.

04:06.040 --> 04:08.810
For intelligence purposes,
defense, trade.

04:08.810 --> 04:10.780
I'm not trying to hide that.

04:10.780 --> 04:13.250
(Rami) And we can use
all the help we can get.

04:15.380 --> 04:19.290
I know what my general wants,
but I have a problem

04:19.290 --> 04:20.690
you can't help me with.

04:20.690 --> 04:22.890
It's essential
that I continue to be seen

04:22.890 --> 04:24.690
as the Arab leader
of an Arab country.

04:24.690 --> 04:26.860
But my years

04:26.860 --> 04:29.360
in the United States
make that more difficult.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.230
We could be
 a silent partner.

04:31.230 --> 04:33.500
I thought the United States
was inherently noisy.

04:33.500 --> 04:34.800
I assume you've met

04:34.800 --> 04:36.000
our Foreign Secretary?

04:36.000 --> 04:38.740
As First Lady, yes. Madam.

04:38.740 --> 04:39.740
General.

04:39.740 --> 04:41.010
(Barry) I'm not
sure that I can

04:41.010 --> 04:42.980
accept your offer,
generous though it is.

04:42.980 --> 04:46.310
But, uh, why don't you two
work out some details.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.150
Give me something
to consider.

04:57.360 --> 04:59.590
Have you been
waiting for me?

04:59.600 --> 05:02.600
You told Aziz I'm not
permitted to bury my wife?

05:02.600 --> 05:05.900
In a public ceremony,
that's right.

05:05.900 --> 05:08.040
It's a very bad idea,
 Ahmed.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.270
Why? Everyone else

05:09.270 --> 05:11.610
in this country gets to
apologize and be forgiven.

05:11.610 --> 05:13.170
Why not her?

05:13.180 --> 05:15.780
People can forgive
her, not you.

05:15.780 --> 05:17.380
Not yet.

05:17.380 --> 05:20.320
She tried to assassinate
your father, Ahmed.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.220
Your father.

05:22.220 --> 05:25.050
You just need a little bit
more time to get over that.

05:25.050 --> 05:28.590
There would have been
a civil war between you and him.

05:28.590 --> 05:30.360
She saved us from that.

05:30.360 --> 05:33.930
She's a hero to many people
in this country.

05:33.930 --> 05:37.200
I understand that, I do.

05:37.200 --> 05:40.030
But she killed herself,
and that's a major sin.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.270
Oh, so
 you've found God now?

05:42.270 --> 05:44.370
We are a public family.

05:44.370 --> 05:45.870
Perception matters.

05:45.870 --> 05:48.240
Right.

05:48.240 --> 05:51.040
You haven't found God.

05:51.050 --> 05:52.710
You found politics.

05:52.710 --> 05:55.550
Oh, Ahmed.

05:55.550 --> 05:57.550
God is politics.

06:05.730 --> 06:08.090
(professor) Don't forget to read
chapter seven for tomorrow.

06:08.100 --> 06:10.430
And be prepared to talk about
whether enforcing

06:10.430 --> 06:12.730
Sharia as state
law contradicts

06:12.730 --> 06:14.400
its religious nature.

06:14.400 --> 06:18.340
Professor El-Amin,
I want you to meet my friend,

06:18.340 --> 06:19.740
Sammy Al Fayeed.

06:19.740 --> 06:21.140
Mr. Al Fayeed.

06:21.140 --> 06:23.910
Hi. Um, I know I've
missed three weeks,

06:23.910 --> 06:26.010
but I... I'd love to take your
class, if you don't mind.

06:26.010 --> 06:27.350
I'd love to have you.

06:27.350 --> 06:28.520
Great.

06:28.520 --> 06:31.250
Reading materials are...

06:31.250 --> 06:33.250
listed at the top.

06:33.260 --> 06:35.190
I know. It's a lot.

06:35.190 --> 06:37.690
But I'm sure Halima didn't
tell you I was an easy teacher.

06:37.690 --> 06:41.290
No, she didn't, but she doesn't
tell me a lot of things.

06:41.300 --> 06:44.130
Uh, why don't I tutor you.

06:44.130 --> 06:46.930
At least for the first few weeks
so you can catch up.

06:46.940 --> 06:50.100
Yes. Thank you.

06:50.110 --> 06:52.140
Call me Haitham.

06:52.140 --> 06:53.810
When we're not in class.

06:53.810 --> 06:54.880
Of course.

06:54.880 --> 06:56.140
(Molly's voice)<i> Not only as</i>

06:56.140 --> 06:58.310
First Lady,
but also as a physician.

06:58.310 --> 06:59.410
You were great.

06:59.410 --> 07:02.150
Really relaxed,
authoritative,

07:02.150 --> 07:04.350
- very first lady-ish.
- (Molly chuckles)

07:04.350 --> 07:05.390
(Molly) It's not really 
my thing,

07:05.390 --> 07:07.190
being on TV,
 but thank you.

07:09.190 --> 07:11.290
Oh, my gosh.

07:11.290 --> 07:15.030
He doesn't even look
that much older than me.

07:17.170 --> 07:18.630
Can I come with you?

07:18.630 --> 07:19.770
If he can do that

07:19.770 --> 07:21.330
for his country,

07:21.340 --> 07:22.370
I can do this.

07:22.370 --> 07:23.370
(door opens)

07:23.370 --> 07:24.570
(Aziz) Phone call for you,

07:24.570 --> 07:26.470
Mr. President,
in your office.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.280
It's Fauzi Nidal.

07:29.180 --> 07:31.380
Thank you, Aziz.

07:31.380 --> 07:32.480
Fauzi?

07:32.480 --> 07:35.520
Have you talked to him
since his daughter died?

07:35.520 --> 07:37.550
Uh, no.

07:37.550 --> 07:39.450
Oh, God, Barry,
 are you okay?

07:41.760 --> 07:43.590
Yeah, yeah.

07:54.440 --> 07:56.000
Fauzi.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.100
I've been waiting for this
for a long time.

07:58.110 --> 08:02.510
Bassam, I'm sorry
it's been so long.

08:02.510 --> 08:04.540
So much has changed
for both of us.

08:04.550 --> 08:06.450
I'm actually
 on my way home.

08:06.450 --> 08:07.680
I'm just on a layover

08:07.680 --> 08:09.250
in Dubai.

08:09.250 --> 08:10.950
You're coming back?

08:10.950 --> 08:14.920
Yeah. I got an invitation
from the Student Union

08:14.920 --> 08:18.220
to talk about the political
changes in Abuddin.

08:18.230 --> 08:20.530
I turned them down
 at first.

08:20.530 --> 08:23.060
I couldn't.

08:23.070 --> 08:25.700
But the truth is
I had to come home sometime.

08:27.900 --> 08:29.700
Yeah, of course.

08:34.140 --> 08:35.840
I miss her every day.

08:35.840 --> 08:38.840
(sighing)

08:41.450 --> 08:43.450
(clicks lips)

08:43.450 --> 08:46.490
Fauzi, I'm so sorry.

08:46.490 --> 08:47.790
I tried to call you.

08:47.790 --> 08:49.220
I knew you would.

08:49.220 --> 08:50.660
I changed my number.

08:50.660 --> 08:52.830
I didn't want to be found.

08:52.830 --> 08:55.260
But it'll be good
to see you now.

08:55.260 --> 08:57.630
We have so much
 to catch up on.

08:59.170 --> 09:01.230
Yes, we do.

09:01.230 --> 09:04.230

11:06.260 --> 11:08.660
This is all my

11:10.600 --> 11:12.700
We'll leave the
body unmarked.

11:14.640 --> 11:17.140
(voice breaking) It's the best
 I could do for her.

11:19.540 --> 11:21.540
Thank you for coming.

11:21.540 --> 11:22.880
(Sammy) What are you
 talking about?

- We're family.

11:26.010 --> 11:28.010
(clanging sound)

11:35.620 --> 11:39.160
It's hard to believe this is
the guy we were all afraid of.

11:39.160 --> 11:41.500
Was it worth it, old man?

11:41.500 --> 11:44.260
This is what you got
for all your troubles.

11:44.270 --> 11:46.470
Everyone ends up like this
one way or another.

11:46.470 --> 11:48.230
- You, too.
- Yeah.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.200
But no one will spit
on my grave.

11:53.780 --> 11:55.410
It's okay.

11:55.410 --> 11:57.740
It's all over now.

12:00.480 --> 12:02.980
What good is it gonna
do to tell him?

12:02.980 --> 12:04.620
It won't bring her back.

12:04.620 --> 12:06.020
It won't make
his pain go away.

12:06.020 --> 12:08.460
The only thing that will
change is him and me.

12:08.460 --> 12:09.460
And the way the world is,

12:09.460 --> 12:11.120
I think we're both
gonna need each other.

12:11.130 --> 12:14.190
You have to tell him,
as terrible as that will be.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.200
Why?

12:15.200 --> 12:17.070
Because if you don't,

12:17.070 --> 12:20.400
and he finds out any other way,
there will be no going back.

12:20.400 --> 12:21.230
How is he gonna
find out?

12:21.230 --> 12:22.670
The only people who were
there were you and me.

12:22.670 --> 12:24.440
Who's gonna tell him?

12:27.880 --> 12:29.640
What?

12:29.640 --> 12:33.780
You've asked the whole country
to confess their sins.

12:33.780 --> 12:36.350
Told them the truth
will set them free.

12:36.350 --> 12:38.720
How can you begin
 with a lie?

12:41.490 --> 12:45.090
Show them
what honesty looks like.

12:47.360 --> 12:49.560
Some things
are better left unsaid.

12:52.900 --> 12:57.900
♪♪

12:59.900 --> 13:02.900
(pulls hand towel)

13:11.820 --> 13:14.390
(Fauzi)<i> When 90%
 of the wealth</i>

13:14.390 --> 13:17.990
is controlled by 10%
of the population,

13:17.990 --> 13:20.760
and you add to that
 cronyism,

13:20.760 --> 13:24.700
corruption,
political repression,

13:24.700 --> 13:27.600
pretty soon
people will get desperate.

13:27.600 --> 13:31.740
And when people are desperate,
they do desperate things.

13:31.740 --> 13:34.440
Like joining the Caliphate.

13:37.110 --> 13:39.150
Like my daughter did.

13:41.850 --> 13:45.520
I know the risks
of hopelessness firsthand.

13:49.390 --> 13:52.290
Now, I made
an old man's mistake.

13:52.290 --> 13:54.560
I gave up.

13:54.560 --> 13:58.360
And moved away.

13:58.370 --> 13:59.970
But you didn't.

13:59.970 --> 14:02.140
You stayed
 and you fought.

14:02.140 --> 14:04.270
Your cry of bread,
 freedom

14:04.270 --> 14:09.540
and social justice
is the cry of the revolution.

14:09.540 --> 14:12.450
And now it has to be
the cry of this election.

14:14.120 --> 14:16.980
That's the promise
of Bassam Al Fayeed.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.820
But he's not running.

14:18.820 --> 14:20.650
There's no candidate
saying these things.

14:20.660 --> 14:23.260
It's still early.

14:23.260 --> 14:24.720
Find one.

14:24.730 --> 14:26.660
What about you?

14:26.660 --> 14:28.330
(Fauzi chuckles)
(students murmur quietly)

14:32.400 --> 14:34.070
I'm not a politician.

14:34.070 --> 14:36.170
Exactly.

14:36.170 --> 14:39.170
(students murmuring)

14:40.800 --> 14:43.680
(sizzling)
(utensil clanging)

14:43.680 --> 14:46.980
Megan, don't ruin
another man's life

14:46.980 --> 14:49.280
just because you want
to get even with me.

14:49.280 --> 14:53.920
I don't give two shits
what you do with my Lieutenant.

14:53.920 --> 14:56.660
Let's just
get this over with.

14:56.660 --> 14:58.790
File the papers.

14:58.790 --> 15:00.590
Just file them.

15:00.590 --> 15:02.590
(phone beeps)

15:10.470 --> 15:14.510
My soon-to-be ex-wife still
knows how to push my buttons.

15:15.340 --> 15:17.680
All this time,

15:17.680 --> 15:19.780
I never knew
a marriage could just end.

15:22.550 --> 15:24.880
Things have, uh...

15:24.890 --> 15:26.690
well, changed

15:26.690 --> 15:28.820
quite a bit since the last time
we saw each other.

15:28.820 --> 15:30.160
Yes.

15:30.160 --> 15:32.790
Life has dealt us both
a few blows.

15:39.170 --> 15:41.630
You certainly don't look
any the worse for it.

15:42.640 --> 15:44.700
I owe you an apology.

15:44.710 --> 15:46.370
Really? Why?

15:46.370 --> 15:49.340
After you went to Damascus
and brought Jamal home,

15:49.340 --> 15:51.940
cleaned up his mess...

15:54.550 --> 15:57.150
I was the one who asked you
to be transferred.

15:58.150 --> 16:00.320
I always thought
 it was Jamal.

16:00.320 --> 16:03.190
I figured I...
 I knew too much.

16:03.190 --> 16:04.990
It was me.

16:04.990 --> 16:07.930
You were dangerous, but not
because you knew too much.

16:09.900 --> 16:12.230
Well, if you've come here
to apologize,

16:12.230 --> 16:14.500
there's absolutely
no need for it.

16:16.440 --> 16:18.870
I'm here on orders
of my President.

16:18.870 --> 16:21.170
(Aziz)<i> Mr. President.</i>

16:25.450 --> 16:27.280
Bassam.

16:27.280 --> 16:28.280
(chuckles)

16:28.280 --> 16:29.580
Fauzi.

16:29.580 --> 16:31.250
Ah?

16:31.250 --> 16:32.290
How have you been?

16:32.290 --> 16:34.350
Amsterdam was good.

16:34.360 --> 16:35.860
But it's not home.

16:36.890 --> 16:38.760
I saw Emma when
I walked in.

16:38.760 --> 16:40.590
18 years old.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.600
My goodness,
she's lovely.

16:44.800 --> 16:46.030
Fauzi.

16:46.030 --> 16:47.230
What?

16:47.240 --> 16:49.070
A daughter's a blessing.

16:49.070 --> 16:51.540
And look at you.

16:51.540 --> 16:53.540
In the Palace. (chuckles)

16:53.540 --> 16:55.310
I always said
 this is where

16:55.310 --> 16:56.440
you were meant
 to be.

16:56.440 --> 16:58.040
Well, it's only temporary.

16:58.050 --> 17:02.180
But, uh... yes, you did.

17:04.720 --> 17:06.550
Come on.

17:09.290 --> 17:11.290
So how's the university?

17:11.290 --> 17:14.130
Well, the students
are wonderful.

17:14.130 --> 17:16.099
And energized, really.

17:16.099 --> 17:18.060
In my whole life,

17:18.069 --> 17:20.530
I've never felt such
a sense of possibility.

17:21.940 --> 17:24.900
At one point, the
young woman in charge,

17:24.910 --> 17:26.569
Halima... she says
she knows you...

17:26.569 --> 17:29.240
she actually suggested

17:29.240 --> 17:32.850
that I run for
President myself.

17:32.850 --> 17:34.350
Can you believe that?

17:37.950 --> 17:40.790
What?

17:40.790 --> 17:43.320
Oh, you're just as crazy
as she is.

17:43.320 --> 17:46.090
I guess so.

17:46.090 --> 17:48.330
I think you're exactly
what this country needs.

17:58.210 --> 18:00.370
Yeah, well...

18:00.380 --> 18:02.410
Yeah, I... I can't do that.

18:04.120 --> 18:07.120
(sniffles)

18:07.120 --> 18:10.680
I'm a broken man, my friend.

18:14.820 --> 18:17.590
I mean, you knew her.

18:22.160 --> 18:24.730
- She was a good girl.
- Yeah.

18:27.200 --> 18:29.040
Yeah.

18:37.680 --> 18:40.710
And...

18:40.720 --> 18:42.220
(sighs)

18:42.220 --> 18:44.080
(sniffles)

18:44.090 --> 18:45.490
You know, I promised
I wouldn't do this

18:45.490 --> 18:47.320
in front of you, and now...

18:47.320 --> 18:51.020
I should go.
I... I should go.

18:51.030 --> 18:54.090
Uh, I'll...
I'll call you.

18:54.100 --> 18:55.830
It was good to
see you again.

18:58.100 --> 19:00.330
Fauzi, wait.

19:02.740 --> 19:05.240
(chuckles)

19:07.110 --> 19:08.540
You got a little...

19:08.540 --> 19:11.310
barbecue sauce
there in the...

19:12.780 --> 19:14.910
I can drink this stuff.

19:14.920 --> 19:16.380
Huh?

19:16.380 --> 19:18.720
(laughs) Oh, don't be coy.

19:18.720 --> 19:22.260
You are proud of your
prodigious barbecuing skills.

19:22.260 --> 19:24.560
Americans do
some things right.

19:24.560 --> 19:25.630
That's right.

19:25.630 --> 19:27.260
America would make
 a great ally

19:27.260 --> 19:29.930
- because we're great at barbecue.
- (Leila laughing)

19:29.930 --> 19:31.700
What else could you ask for?

19:31.700 --> 19:34.200
I'll make a list.

19:35.140 --> 19:37.370
I have a list, actually.

19:38.610 --> 19:42.140
I want your next President
to accept our help.

19:44.080 --> 19:46.280
I think you need us.

19:47.280 --> 19:48.610
That's it?

19:48.620 --> 19:50.080
Well, on my end,

19:50.080 --> 19:52.920
I'd like a permanent
military presence here.

19:52.920 --> 19:56.060
And then, if I'm lucky,

19:56.060 --> 19:59.160
a relationship
with your next President.

20:02.130 --> 20:04.860
That will be the next
President's decision to make.

20:07.070 --> 20:10.170
I'm here as
Foreign Secretary.

20:10.170 --> 20:12.070
For now.

20:12.070 --> 20:13.910
Right.

20:13.910 --> 20:16.380
We wouldn't want
to be inappropriate.

20:18.850 --> 20:20.650
Never.

20:20.650 --> 20:22.950
It was just
the three of us.

20:22.950 --> 20:24.280
All night.

20:24.290 --> 20:28.150
I begged her
to let us walk away.

20:28.150 --> 20:30.020
I said I'd take her with us.

20:33.360 --> 20:37.700
I did everything
that I could to save her, Fauzi.

20:39.700 --> 20:42.170
She didn't want
to be saved.

20:42.170 --> 20:44.170
She was lost.

20:44.170 --> 20:48.340
She pointed her gun at me,
and she shot me.

20:49.940 --> 20:52.610
And then...

20:52.610 --> 20:54.680
she pointed it at Daliyah.

20:57.620 --> 21:00.090
"I'll kill her," she said.

21:04.730 --> 21:07.290
I couldn't let that happen.

21:15.140 --> 21:17.140
(crying) I...

21:23.140 --> 21:24.910
I'm sorry.

21:41.330 --> 21:43.660
I don't want your apologies!

21:43.660 --> 21:45.260
I want my daughter back!

21:46.100 --> 21:48.100
- I want her back!
- Mr. President!

21:48.100 --> 21:49.340
Get back! Get back!

21:49.340 --> 21:53.570
I want her back!
I want her back!

21:53.570 --> 21:56.380
You want to
kill me, kill me.

21:56.380 --> 21:58.880
But then they'll kill you
and we'll all be dead.

21:58.880 --> 22:00.910
(groaning)

22:06.910 --> 22:09.220
(panting)

22:09.220 --> 22:10.860
(crying softly)

22:13.060 --> 22:15.090
No.

22:15.100 --> 22:17.060
I thought losing
a child was the last

22:17.060 --> 22:20.230
terrible thing
that could ever happen to me.

22:20.230 --> 22:23.040
That I had nothing else
 to lose.

22:25.970 --> 22:28.270
But now you're gone, too.

22:31.970 --> 22:33.970
(sighs)

22:40.970 --> 22:43.970
(gasps)

22:52.970 --> 22:55.530
(indistinct chatter)

23:00.640 --> 23:02.680
(Al-Qadi) Nafisa, my darling.

23:03.680 --> 23:05.410
Your brother's
 on his way out.

23:05.410 --> 23:06.650
He'll take you home.

23:07.620 --> 23:08.880
There he is.

23:09.850 --> 23:11.980
Wafiq.

23:11.990 --> 23:13.990
You know
 where he's going?

23:13.990 --> 23:16.460
To sit on Bassam Al Fayeed's
election committee.

23:16.460 --> 23:18.860
I can't talk to him
anymore about that.

23:18.860 --> 23:20.190
He knows how I feel.

23:20.190 --> 23:21.830
You cooperate with them,

23:21.830 --> 23:24.530
and you risk turning
your followers into enemies.

23:24.530 --> 23:26.430
I don't have followers.

23:26.430 --> 23:28.030
God has followers.

23:28.040 --> 23:29.700
Let's go home, Nafisa.

23:29.700 --> 23:31.600
It's no use.
You're wasting your breath.

23:31.610 --> 23:34.040
We have been here before.
A year ago.

23:34.040 --> 23:36.710
They call an election.
We give it legitimacy.

23:36.710 --> 23:39.810
At the end, they pulled the rug
from under our feet,

23:39.810 --> 23:41.780
and we look like dupes.

23:41.780 --> 23:43.520
What's my alternative?

23:43.520 --> 23:45.990
Sit out and let others decide
the future of our country?

23:45.990 --> 23:47.650
Agitate.

23:47.660 --> 23:50.020
Call on God's followers
to resist.

23:51.390 --> 23:53.290
Make his peaceful election
impossible.

23:53.290 --> 23:55.230
I'm not Ihab bin Rashid.

23:55.230 --> 23:56.500
(Wafiq) Give it time.

23:56.500 --> 23:58.560
Even Ihab wasn't Ihab

23:58.570 --> 24:01.070
until the Al Fayeeds
messed with him.

24:02.570 --> 24:04.570
(engines roaring)

24:06.840 --> 24:10.880
The First Lady's here
for the Al Fayeed sales pitch.

24:10.880 --> 24:15.550
- Make us think they give a shit.
- (Wafiq exhales sharply)

24:29.260 --> 24:31.730
I can't believe
what happened to this place.

24:31.730 --> 24:35.470
I mean,
I saw it on the news, but...

24:46.580 --> 24:48.350
Are you ill, Jalal?

24:50.250 --> 24:51.680
Jalal?

24:51.680 --> 24:52.690
(tires screech)

24:52.690 --> 24:55.190
What are you doing?
Why are you stopping?

24:59.630 --> 25:01.390
(both gasp)

25:01.400 --> 25:03.330
(men shouting)

25:03.330 --> 25:05.330
(bullets bouncing)

25:06.770 --> 25:08.700
Get out! My side!

25:08.700 --> 25:09.800
- Time to go.
- (Emma whimpers)

25:12.000 --> 25:13.400
(man screams)

25:19.080 --> 25:21.120
You need to run. I'll cover you.

25:21.120 --> 25:23.150
Go!
(machine gun shooting)

25:24.490 --> 25:25.580
No.

25:25.590 --> 25:26.720
(man) They are getting away.

25:26.720 --> 25:27.920
Ihab wants her alive.

25:27.920 --> 25:29.720
(gunfire continues)

25:29.720 --> 25:30.960
It's okay.

25:30.960 --> 25:33.960
(men shouting in distance)

25:34.160 --> 25:35.890
Emma, this way.

25:35.900 --> 25:37.460
I can't.

25:37.470 --> 25:39.060
I can't, I can't.

25:39.070 --> 25:41.000
Emma, look at me.
 You can.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.500
Okay, okay?
They're coming.

25:43.500 --> 25:44.840
- No!
- (Emma gasps)

25:46.340 --> 25:48.410
Mom! Mom!

25:48.410 --> 25:49.480
Mom, please, please.

25:49.480 --> 25:51.910
(men shouting)

25:54.020 --> 25:55.480
Please, please get up.

26:14.200 --> 26:16.340
(men shouting)

26:28.620 --> 26:30.450
No! Please don't kill me!

26:30.450 --> 26:32.180
Your mother...
where is she?

26:32.190 --> 26:34.820
We got separated.

26:34.820 --> 26:36.220
Where's the mother?

26:36.220 --> 26:37.860
She says

Emma!

You are not
 Ihab bin Rashid.

27:40.820 --> 27:43.590
And I am not my brother.

27:43.590 --> 27:45.760
Power changes people.

You might grow to like
being a president.

27:49.430 --> 27:52.260
Mr. President, I need to
talk to you right away.

27:52.270 --> 27:55.370
There's been an attack on the
First Lady's motorcade in Ma'an.

27:55.370 --> 27:58.370
She's safe and heading
to the Palace now.

27:58.370 --> 28:01.510
But General Said is dead, and
your daughter has been taken.

28:04.450 --> 28:06.180
I'm sorry, Sheik.

28:06.180 --> 28:06.880
I need to go.

The borders of these countries

They don't have
national identities

the way you think
of them in the West.

28:22.330 --> 28:23.330
Right.

Loyalties are tribal,
not national.

Can I get you

Being a president

after all,
I tried my best.

And what circumstances
were those?

32:19.630 --> 32:21.700
(sighs)

The way my father raised me.

give me the chance.

32:38.320 --> 32:39.890
Of course you would.

32:39.890 --> 32:42.320
But the problem is bigger than
Ihab bin Rashid, Aziz,

32:42.320 --> 32:43.990
and it won't end
if he's dead.

the problem?

stone me to death

and, uh, it should also help her
sleep through the night.

40:17.180 --> 40:19.080
Okay. Thank you.

40:33.790 --> 40:35.960
I'm gonna get her back.

40:41.970 --> 40:43.300
I promise.

40:53.050 --> 40:55.550
Why does Ihab want me?

41:07.690 --> 41:11.000
I barely knew her
growing up.

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
We visited them twice
in California.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.400
I remember her bedroom.

41:16.400 --> 41:19.400
Um, I think she was
ten years old.

41:21.240 --> 41:26.180
Her walls were covered with
pictures of boys from magazines.

41:26.180 --> 41:29.680
It was so... ordinary.

41:29.680 --> 41:32.080
Hmm.

41:32.090 --> 41:35.620
Can't imagine how terrible it
is to have your child taken.

41:37.420 --> 41:40.060
I have a daughter.

41:40.060 --> 41:42.060
I know.

41:42.060 --> 41:44.330
I never see her.

41:46.730 --> 41:50.440
But I remember once I took her
to the grocery store by myself.

41:50.440 --> 41:53.910
She was so little,
walking down the aisle and...

41:53.910 --> 41:56.640
(chuckles) picking out an apple.

41:56.640 --> 41:58.640
And as I was watching,

41:58.650 --> 42:02.650
she grabbed another man's hand,
thinking it was me.

42:06.250 --> 42:10.150
And I thought, "My wife
is going to divorce me."

42:13.630 --> 42:15.630
And one of these days,

42:15.630 --> 42:18.630
my little girl
is gonna grab the hand

42:18.630 --> 42:20.700
of another man
and call him Daddy.

42:23.970 --> 42:26.970
Our children are
our greatest vulnerability.

42:26.970 --> 42:29.040
Yeah.

42:32.180 --> 42:34.250
I gave up everything
for my son.

42:37.080 --> 42:39.920
If I had been childless,

42:39.920 --> 42:42.390
I would have run away
a long time ago.

42:46.190 --> 42:48.690
Or thrown myself
out of a window.

42:54.130 --> 42:58.200
Or kept you here...
in Abuddin.

43:18.460 --> 43:21.990
Aziz said I could
wait for you.

43:22.000 --> 43:25.400
I debated for the longest time
if it was okay to come here.

43:25.400 --> 43:27.470
It's okay.

43:29.570 --> 43:31.240
Where's Molly?

43:31.240 --> 43:33.240
Molly's asleep upstairs.

43:33.240 --> 43:35.310
I gave her some pills.

43:41.680 --> 43:43.750
You'll get her back.

43:43.750 --> 43:45.750
(Daliyah sighs)

43:52.330 --> 43:54.730
She'll come back.

43:54.730 --> 43:57.130
I don't know what to do.

44:03.100 --> 44:05.540
We'll just talk it through.

44:05.540 --> 44:07.610
As always.

44:11.010 --> 44:13.610

44:21.890 --> 44:23.290
What are you doing here?

44:23.290 --> 44:24.720
Are you alone?

44:24.720 --> 44:26.260
Yes, I drove myself.

44:26.260 --> 44:27.760
It's not safe for you here.

44:27.760 --> 44:29.590
Please.

44:29.600 --> 44:31.730
(door closes)
Nafisa, please fetch some tea.

44:31.730 --> 44:35.300
I'm sorry to do this,
but I need your help.

44:35.300 --> 44:38.100
I need to contact
Ihab bin Rashid.

44:38.100 --> 44:41.110
What makes you think
I know bin Rashid?

44:41.110 --> 44:43.040
- Please.
- You need to go.

44:43.040 --> 44:43.940
(Nafisa) We had nothing
 to do

44:43.940 --> 44:45.480
with him
 taking your daughter.

44:45.480 --> 44:46.910
No. No, no.
I'm... I'm not accusing you.

44:46.910 --> 44:47.830
I'm not trying to trap you.

44:47.830 --> 44:49.480
I just need your help.

44:49.480 --> 44:50.950
I have to get her back.

44:50.950 --> 44:53.890
I'm so sorry for your daughter,

44:53.890 --> 44:55.790
- but you can't...
- If you're sorry, you'll help me.

44:55.790 --> 44:57.490
I have no contact 
with Ihab.

44:57.490 --> 44:59.360
But you know people
 who do.

45:03.330 --> 45:06.700
Does... your husband,
does he know you're here?

45:07.730 --> 45:09.730
He can't know, not ever.

45:12.140 --> 45:14.010
I'm gonna trade
my life for hers.

45:14.010 --> 45:16.070
Will you help me do it?

45:31.030 --> 45:36.030
