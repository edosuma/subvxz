WEBVTT

00:08.867 --> 00:11.654
Hollywood,
where dreams come true,

00:12.510 --> 00:15.681
unless you dare to dream
something bold and original.

00:16.783 --> 00:19.383
My name is Eric Jonrosh.

00:19.385 --> 00:23.521
And I invite you to part two
of my epic miniseries

00:23.523 --> 00:25.656
<i>The Spoils of Babylon.</i>

00:25.658 --> 00:28.726
After a painful ordeal
to bring my popular novels

00:28.728 --> 00:30.761
to television,
I gave up.

00:30.763 --> 00:32.830
I could see that
the network executives

00:32.832 --> 00:34.332
cared little for art,

00:34.334 --> 00:38.202
so I filmed <i>The Spoils</i>
<i>of Babylon</i> on my own,

00:38.204 --> 00:39.837
with my own money,

00:39.839 --> 00:44.375
money gotten from
many best-selling novels.

00:44.377 --> 00:47.678
I lived and breathed <i>Spoils</i>
for three years.

00:47.680 --> 00:49.514
I slept with the cast.

00:49.516 --> 00:53.151
Every member of the cast
you'll see tonight,

00:53.153 --> 00:54.318
I slept with.

00:54.320 --> 00:57.622
My wife at the time,
Lauoreighiya Samcake,

00:57.624 --> 00:59.490
the actress who plays
Cynthia Morehouse,

00:59.492 --> 01:03.394
was very adventurous
in all matters sexual.

01:03.396 --> 01:05.863
The woman had no shame.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.801
Like Eve before the fall.

01:10.803 --> 01:14.205
We often would
hold up shooting to...

01:14.207 --> 01:18.209
to take pleasure
of each other's flesh

01:18.211 --> 01:19.911
in front of everyone.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.379
In fact, she could...

01:21.381 --> 01:23.915
Tonight's episode covers
the war years,

01:23.917 --> 01:28.452
and they are based on my own
terrifying experiences

01:28.454 --> 01:32.190
reading about the war
as a child.

01:32.192 --> 01:35.626
The deep love between Cynthia
and her brother Devon

01:35.628 --> 01:37.795
cannot be torn apart by war

01:37.797 --> 01:39.330
or separated by an ocean.

01:39.332 --> 01:41.532
But Devon's return home
changes everything,

01:41.534 --> 01:44.936
sets into motion the great drama
of their lives.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.772
Please, won't you enjoy
part two

01:47.774 --> 01:50.975
of my wonderful miniseries?

01:50.977 --> 01:54.458
<i>The Spoils of Babylon.</i>

01:55.915 --> 01:58.716
Why would I say, "wonderful"?

01:58.718 --> 02:00.560
Makes no bloody sense.

02:01.086 --> 02:02.814
No one says, "wonderful."

02:03.511 --> 02:06.412
Sounds like something a man
from a circus would say.

02:07.333 --> 02:10.768
A carnival barker, if you will,
would say, "wonderful."

02:10.788 --> 02:13.389
I don't say, "wonderful."
I never have.

02:13.666 --> 02:16.500
I refuse to say, "wonderful."

02:17.095 --> 02:20.721
It's not wonderful.
It's... it's momentous.

02:21.247 --> 02:22.713
It's epic.

02:23.309 --> 02:25.946
But this miniseries
is not wonderf...

02:26.038 --> 02:28.772
<i>Previously
on </i> The Spoils of Babylon <i>...</i>

02:30.950 --> 02:32.950
<i>My name is Devon Morehouse.</i>

02:33.186 --> 02:35.574
My story is an epic one.

02:35.655 --> 02:36.954
Look, Father,
there's someone walkin'.

02:37.135 --> 02:39.757
From now on,
your last name is Morehouse.

02:39.795 --> 02:42.353
You can't marry me. You heard
father. I'm your brother now.

02:42.418 --> 02:44.306
We're not even related.
Kiss me.

02:44.375 --> 02:48.032
The money ran out, and most of
his land was sold off for taxes.

02:48.034 --> 02:50.000
That well ain't
never comin' in.

02:50.002 --> 02:51.998
There's oil down in that ground.
And I'm gonna get it.

02:52.052 --> 02:54.104
Devon, we struck oil!

02:54.106 --> 02:55.773
Son of a bitch, it's oil!

02:55.775 --> 02:57.908
You're acting like
you don't want to make money.

02:57.910 --> 03:00.010
I don't. Never have.

03:00.012 --> 03:02.780
Devon, you haven't asked me
to dance all night.

03:03.274 --> 03:05.950
<i>Pearl Harbor came under attack
from Japanese naval forces.</i>

03:05.952 --> 03:08.048
- What does it mean?
- It means war, Cynthia.

03:08.111 --> 03:09.243
I'm joining up.

03:09.347 --> 03:10.713
This is my life.

03:10.736 --> 03:12.636
Or what remains of it.

03:15.723 --> 03:19.458
Sync & corrections by dwigt
www.addic7ed.com

03:26.806 --> 03:29.773
Morehouse to squadron leader,
I'm taking enemy fire.

03:29.775 --> 03:32.243
<i>Hold 'em off, son.
Keep those Japs off our bombers.</i>

03:32.245 --> 03:37.047
There's more action up here
than a cathouse on payday.

03:39.519 --> 03:41.360
Take that, Hirohito!

03:41.408 --> 03:43.241
<i>- Nice shooting, Morehouse.</i>
- Whoo!

03:43.243 --> 03:44.342
It's hotter than a cathouse

03:44.364 --> 03:46.258
on a Saturday night
in July, captain.

03:46.300 --> 03:47.866
<i>Don't look now, but Japs
coming in</i>

03:47.909 --> 03:49.009
<i>at 12 o'clock.</i>

03:49.051 --> 03:50.435
Roger that. Diving.

03:53.232 --> 03:55.457
<i>Look out, Morehouse.</i>

03:57.603 --> 04:00.664
- I'm hit! I'm hit!
<i>- Bail out, Morehouse, bail out!</i>

04:00.688 --> 04:01.905
Sorry, captain.

04:01.949 --> 04:03.809
Gonna look around
for some mischief to get into.

04:03.874 --> 04:05.985
<i>Eject now, soldier,
that's an order!</i>

04:06.245 --> 04:07.244
No can do.

04:07.246 --> 04:09.747
Looks like the man upstairs
has punched my ticket.

04:09.749 --> 04:12.149
I'm headin' to
that big cathouse in the sky.

04:12.151 --> 04:14.218
<i>Morehouse, don't be a fool!</i>

04:14.220 --> 04:16.786
Fool?
I don't think so.

04:17.178 --> 04:20.499
Is it a fool who goes up in
flames on the altar of freedom?

04:21.160 --> 04:23.627
Would a fool rather die
than see the world

04:23.629 --> 04:26.297
turned upside-down
by these devils?

04:26.299 --> 04:29.300
No, sir.
I'm no fool.

04:29.302 --> 04:33.270
Unless turning my back on love
makes me a fool.

04:33.272 --> 04:35.239
Which I have done.

04:35.241 --> 04:36.774
Turned my back on love,
I mean.

04:36.776 --> 04:41.312
My father used to say when a man
meets his maker face to face

04:41.314 --> 04:42.913
and has to account
for his time

04:42.915 --> 04:44.248
on this great green Earth
of ours,

04:44.250 --> 04:48.185
what does he stand for
that actually matters?

04:48.187 --> 04:49.587
I mean, what really counts?

04:49.589 --> 04:52.490
How many enemies he's killed?
The size of his bank account?

04:52.497 --> 04:55.732
Sorry.
I'm not buyin' it.

04:56.822 --> 04:59.789
All that really matters
is how we conduct ourselves

04:59.830 --> 05:01.899
in the throes of love.

05:01.901 --> 05:05.069
Do we shy away from the
vulnerability that love brings

05:05.071 --> 05:06.704
or do we embrace it,

05:06.706 --> 05:10.497
daring to taste
its exquisite pain?

05:20.861 --> 05:22.845
Well, sis.

05:25.013 --> 05:27.987
This is Lieutenant
Devon Morehouse.

05:28.753 --> 05:30.086
If you can still hear me,

05:30.109 --> 05:32.519
please tell my sister that I...

05:47.746 --> 05:50.968
Cynthia, you've been
in your room all day.

05:51.489 --> 05:54.157
I'm sorry, father.

05:54.323 --> 05:55.956
What is it, girl?

05:56.389 --> 05:59.069
It's Devon.
Something's wrong.

05:59.385 --> 06:00.417
Wrong?

06:00.685 --> 06:04.320
Now, you're just
filling your head with fear.

06:04.528 --> 06:08.030
Come downstairs.
It's a party.

06:09.197 --> 06:10.996
Something's wrong.
I can feel it.

06:11.018 --> 06:14.273
We have a special bond.
I know something's wrong.

06:14.425 --> 06:16.691
You got to stop this.

06:16.837 --> 06:19.538
"Special bond."

06:19.643 --> 06:23.592
It's not natural.
I will not be shamed by this.

06:28.454 --> 06:31.576
Father, no! Ah!

06:37.430 --> 06:40.435
Oh, Devon.
Why can't I go to you?

06:40.538 --> 06:42.805
Where are you, Devon?

06:43.402 --> 06:45.936
Oh, Devon.

06:45.938 --> 06:48.772
Oh...

06:48.774 --> 06:52.209
That will go down
as the finest landing

06:52.211 --> 06:54.411
in history of
the Naval Air Corps.

06:54.413 --> 07:00.250
I must remind myself
to give myself a medal.

07:03.288 --> 07:07.491
Oh, no. I need a light.

07:07.493 --> 07:10.558
Oh, well.
Gotta find a light.

07:22.621 --> 07:23.954
Finally.

07:24.654 --> 07:27.391
Any one of you fish eaters
got a light?

07:39.255 --> 07:41.423
We know that his plane
went down over Okajaba.

07:42.636 --> 07:47.052
His captain saw a large ball of
fire rise up when his plane hit.

07:49.100 --> 07:52.469
So you're telling me
that my son

07:53.003 --> 07:56.340
Devon Morehouse is dead?

07:56.342 --> 07:58.175
We can't be certain.

07:58.177 --> 08:00.244
It's unlikely
any man could survive

08:00.246 --> 08:03.180
that kind
of burning destruction

08:03.182 --> 08:05.482
that's created
by a Hellcat upon impact.

08:05.484 --> 08:07.484
No man ever has.

08:07.486 --> 08:09.553
But you don't know.

08:09.555 --> 08:12.489
Why don't you go in there
and organize a raid or something

08:12.491 --> 08:13.524
and bring him out?

08:13.526 --> 08:16.493
- Cynthia.
- I don't understand.

08:16.495 --> 08:17.494
Cynthia.

08:17.496 --> 08:19.062
Is he dead or not?

08:19.064 --> 08:21.398
As General Cauliffe just said,

08:21.400 --> 08:23.801
there isn't a man alive
who could've survived

08:23.803 --> 08:26.537
the fiery inferno
of that plane going down.

08:26.539 --> 08:28.906
Every bone in his body
would've been

08:28.908 --> 08:32.476
charred and crushed.

08:32.477 --> 08:35.145
But we simply can't be sure.

08:35.147 --> 08:37.481
He's on that island.

08:37.482 --> 08:38.948
Let me go there.

08:38.951 --> 08:41.184
Let me talk to
this Mr. "Tanaka."

08:41.187 --> 08:44.154
No need for air quotes.
That's his real name.

08:44.155 --> 08:46.557
Jonas, I'm sorry. We just
have no more information.

08:46.559 --> 08:50.093
Well, I want to thank you
gentlemen for making

08:50.095 --> 08:51.562
the trip out here to the house.

08:51.564 --> 08:54.298
Means a lot to me
and my daughter

08:54.300 --> 08:58.235
that you are here
in this room with us.

08:58.237 --> 09:02.105
It means a lot to us, sir,
to be here with you

09:02.107 --> 09:04.908
in this very room, in person.

09:04.910 --> 09:07.845
Well, thank you for being here
in person in this room.

09:07.847 --> 09:09.947
It's the least we can do
to be with you

09:09.949 --> 09:14.585
here, all together
in the same space and time.

09:15.908 --> 09:20.345
Well, it's always a tough call.

09:20.860 --> 09:25.395
Never know what to say.

09:25.397 --> 09:29.533
Old man seemed
to take it well enough.

09:29.535 --> 09:31.635
I felt sorry for the girl.

09:31.637 --> 09:34.104
- Me too.
- Mm-hmm.

09:34.106 --> 09:37.441
She was a very
good-looking young lady.

09:40.979 --> 09:44.414
If you like that type.
And I do.

09:44.416 --> 09:49.953
To be honest,
I couldn't stop staring at her.

09:50.078 --> 09:52.575
Well, I'll be frank.

09:52.764 --> 09:54.664
When she walked in the room,

09:54.994 --> 09:57.661
I almost forgot
why we were there.

09:57.663 --> 10:01.398
Why were we there?

10:07.438 --> 10:08.572
Ah...

10:08.574 --> 10:09.674
Oh, yeah.

10:15.546 --> 10:19.449
<i>Here's the thing
about the Japanese.</i>

10:19.451 --> 10:22.419
<i>We called them Japs back then.</i>

10:22.421 --> 10:24.288
<i>They're not a bad bunch.</i>

10:24.290 --> 10:28.292
<i>Sure, there was the daily
beatings, the starvation,</i>

10:28.294 --> 10:32.429
<i>the constant barking
in that dog language.</i>

10:32.431 --> 10:34.631
<i>But there was
that occasional smile</i>

10:34.633 --> 10:36.099
<i>and maybe even
a little respect</i>

10:36.101 --> 10:38.669
<i>for a warrior
they couldn't break.</i>

10:38.671 --> 10:42.706
<i>Kinda tore me up a little bit
when I finally got my revenge.</i>

10:52.618 --> 10:56.620
<i>♪ See the marketplace
at Old Algiers ♪</i>

10:59.525 --> 11:04.594
<i>♪ Send me photographs
and souvenirs ♪</i>

11:06.699 --> 11:09.666
<i>♪ Just remember...</i>

11:27.597 --> 11:31.488
<i>This is M-Red 1
to Air Command Base 403.</i>

11:31.490 --> 11:34.424
<i>Come in, Command Base 403.</i>

11:34.426 --> 11:36.760
I need you to hit this hill,
coordinates GC5,

11:36.762 --> 11:40.464
with everything you got,
right down to the beach.

11:40.466 --> 11:42.940
<i>Welcome back to the game,
Lieutenant.</i>

11:44.036 --> 11:47.704
I never left it.

11:47.706 --> 11:49.239
I never...

11:49.241 --> 11:52.709
left it.

11:54.613 --> 11:57.347
<i>My knowledge of the Japanese
took me to London</i>

11:57.349 --> 11:59.349
<i>where I oversaw
the Quadrilateral International</i>

11:59.351 --> 12:02.119
<i>Committee for Wartime
Mission Appropriation.</i>

12:02.121 --> 12:05.555
To the mission, and
the United States of America.

12:05.557 --> 12:07.758
To the United States
of America...

12:07.760 --> 12:09.359
and Great Britain.

12:09.361 --> 12:11.061
- To who?
- England.

12:11.063 --> 12:14.297
- Mm, it's our turn to shine.
- Hear, hear.

12:14.299 --> 12:16.266
- Mm-hmm. Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear. No offense.

12:16.268 --> 12:18.668
- A little bit of offense.
- Well, right.

12:18.670 --> 12:20.604
<i>After the war,
I stayed in London</i>

12:20.606 --> 12:22.773
<i>and tried hard
to forget Cynthia.</i>

12:22.775 --> 12:26.777
<i>I freed myself from her
the only way I knew how.</i>

12:26.779 --> 12:30.714
<i>Only then
could I return home.</i>

12:36.789 --> 12:38.488
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

12:38.490 --> 12:40.690
Oh, wow!
Thank you!

12:40.692 --> 12:44.628
Oh, Devon.
It's really you.

12:44.630 --> 12:48.765
Yes.
So good to see y'all.

12:48.767 --> 12:50.500
Welcome home, son.

12:50.502 --> 12:52.235
I have a surprise for you.

12:52.237 --> 12:57.808
I want to introduce you
to the new Mrs. Devon Morehouse.

13:00.711 --> 13:02.679
Lady Anne York.

13:02.681 --> 13:04.714
<i>Oh, cheery hello.
I'm Lady Anne.</i>

13:04.716 --> 13:08.752
Well, I'll be.

13:08.754 --> 13:12.756
Everybody say hi
to miss lady Anne York.

13:12.758 --> 13:18.195
Nooo!

13:21.799 --> 13:23.366
<i>Oh, Devon.</i>

13:23.368 --> 13:27.571
<i>Was it all
a dreadful mistake?</i>

13:27.573 --> 13:29.272
A mistake?

13:29.274 --> 13:31.675
Never, my love.

13:31.677 --> 13:33.777
Don't say
such foolish things.

13:33.779 --> 13:34.811
How could our...

13:34.813 --> 13:37.681
how could our love
be a mistake?

13:37.683 --> 13:39.449
<i>Well, it's your sister.</i>

13:39.451 --> 13:43.720
<i>The look she gave me
all afternoon is like...</i>

13:43.722 --> 13:44.788
<i>It's like...</i>

13:44.790 --> 13:46.823
It's... it's like what?

13:46.825 --> 13:48.859
<i>I hate to say so.</i>

13:48.861 --> 13:52.696
<i>But it's almost as if
she was not your sister,</i>

13:52.698 --> 13:56.366
<i>but more like
a jealous lover.</i>

13:56.368 --> 13:57.868
No, no, no.

13:57.870 --> 14:00.403
Nonsense.
That's just Cynthia.

14:00.405 --> 14:02.739
We were... we were
very close as kids.

14:02.741 --> 14:04.574
You know, we were... we...

14:04.576 --> 14:06.343
<i>Devon, it's just...</i>

14:06.345 --> 14:10.480
<i>t's just I love you so much.</i>

14:10.482 --> 14:12.916
Oh, yes. I'm... I'm glad.

14:12.918 --> 14:18.588
Hey, um, dinner
isn't for another hour.

14:18.590 --> 14:19.623
<i>Devon, I'm not...</i>

14:19.625 --> 14:21.858
<i>I'm not sure I'm much up
for dinner anyway tonight.</i>

14:21.860 --> 14:23.527
Then how 'bout we, uh...

14:23.529 --> 14:29.699
Go lay down and idle away
our time doing nothing at all?

14:30.501 --> 14:34.938
<i>Oh, Devon, take me to bed.</i>

14:47.919 --> 14:51.230
<i>Oh, Devon, my duke.</i>

15:26.457 --> 15:28.925
I see you've finally
made it to breakfast.

15:28.927 --> 15:30.894
<i>I wish Devon had told me.</i>

15:30.896 --> 15:32.696
Well, we run a business here.

15:32.698 --> 15:33.797
We've all been up for hours.

15:33.799 --> 15:36.566
I'm guessing you didn't
work much in Wellingham.

15:36.568 --> 15:40.870
<i>Wellington</i> shire <i>, and no,
I'm afraid I didn't.</i>

15:40.872 --> 15:42.272
I'm having a bloody Mary

15:42.274 --> 15:43.940
made with Bagpipes O'Tool
brand vodka.

15:43.942 --> 15:44.975
Would you like one?

15:44.977 --> 15:48.945
<i>I don't drink alcohol,
but thank you.</i>

15:48.947 --> 15:50.947
So, what are your plans?

15:50.949 --> 15:53.250
<i>Plans?</i>

15:53.252 --> 15:56.253
<i>Sorry, I don't understand.</i>

15:56.255 --> 15:57.287
You and Devon.

15:57.289 --> 15:58.989
Are you gonna be
staying around here

15:58.991 --> 16:00.890
or going back to England?

16:00.892 --> 16:03.260
<i>Oh, goodness, no.</i>

16:03.262 --> 16:05.328
<i>I'm here to stay.</i>

16:05.330 --> 16:09.399
Here? In this house?

16:09.401 --> 16:11.001
<i>Cynthia,</i>

16:11.003 --> 16:14.404
<i>I do wish
we could be friends.</i>

16:14.406 --> 16:16.306
<i>Devon and I
are man and wife now.</i>

16:16.308 --> 16:18.008
Oh...

16:18.010 --> 16:19.276
Of course.

16:19.278 --> 16:22.445
<i>And I know you have
deep feelings for your brother.</i>

16:22.447 --> 16:25.982
<i>And the two of you do share
a strong filial bond,</i>

16:25.984 --> 16:28.518
<i>but Devon is my husband.</i>

16:28.520 --> 16:29.519
<i>We are lovers.</i>

16:29.521 --> 16:32.722
<i>There is a wonderful
spiritual nature to our love</i>

16:32.724 --> 16:35.592
<i>and at the same time
a delicious earthiness.</i>

16:35.594 --> 16:39.029
<i>A physical bond that
only two bodies coming together</i>

16:39.031 --> 16:41.031
<i>naked in God's eyes
can really know.</i>

16:41.033 --> 16:45.402
<i>For, although you have a sister's
love for Devon, which is lovely,</i>

16:45.404 --> 16:48.004
<i>we have something different...
a lusting,</i>

16:48.006 --> 16:50.006
<i>sensual,
truly naked love,</i>

16:50.008 --> 16:55.345
<i>consummated in both spiritual
and sexual intercourse.</i>

16:56.614 --> 16:59.816
Okay. There's something
you should know.

16:59.818 --> 17:01.618
Devon is in love with me.

17:01.620 --> 17:02.919
And not the kind of love
that you think.

17:02.921 --> 17:07.490
True, he is my brother,
but he is also a man.

17:07.492 --> 17:09.592
And I am a woman,

17:09.594 --> 17:11.861
full-bodied and sensual.

17:11.863 --> 17:14.664
Devon has fought his lust
for me his entire life.

17:14.665 --> 17:15.865
But battles are not war,

17:15.867 --> 17:18.635
and I fight this war
with nature on my side.

17:18.637 --> 17:20.403
And let me tell you something.

17:20.405 --> 17:24.507
Devon will be mine,
and not as my brother,

17:24.509 --> 17:26.009
but as my lover.

17:26.011 --> 17:29.446
<i>- We shall see.</i>
- Yes, we shall.

17:29.448 --> 17:32.048
<i>For now it is my bed
he sleeps in.</i>

17:32.050 --> 17:34.651
<i>And I too am a woman.</i>

17:34.653 --> 17:35.952
<i>Not some cold, distant thing,</i>

17:35.954 --> 17:37.921
<i>but a warm,
voluptuous female animal</i>

17:37.923 --> 17:42.926
<i>who is not afraid to use my own
physical gifts to keep my man.</i>

17:44.496 --> 17:50.033
I hardly think an English tart
is any match for a real woman.

17:50.035 --> 17:52.402
<i>Oh, I'm a real woman.</i>

17:52.404 --> 17:54.003
<i>Any time you want
to find out you can come</i>

17:54.005 --> 17:56.406
<i>and watch your brother
delighting in it.</i>

17:57.376 --> 17:59.075
How dare you?

17:59.344 --> 18:02.101
How dare she what?

18:05.116 --> 18:09.452
How dare she...

18:09.454 --> 18:11.154
Think that this...

18:11.156 --> 18:14.696
silverware of ours is...

18:15.730 --> 18:17.263
better than hers.

18:17.696 --> 18:22.098
You women fight over
the most peculiar things.

18:22.100 --> 18:22.999
Hi, darling.

18:23.001 --> 18:25.135
Devon, we really need to...

18:25.137 --> 18:26.836
talk today
about the business.

18:26.838 --> 18:28.872
You know, Father's ill
and I've been...

18:28.874 --> 18:30.140
Plenty of time to chat later.

18:30.142 --> 18:31.608
But first I want to show
Lady Anne here

18:31.610 --> 18:33.443
what a million acres
looks like.

18:38.150 --> 18:43.153
<i>♪ Lady Anne,
Lady Anne ♪</i>

18:43.155 --> 18:44.621
<i>♪ Burn for all</i>

18:44.623 --> 18:47.857
<i>Oh, my goodness,
there's so many acres.</i>

18:47.859 --> 18:51.494
<i>♪ Summer day,
winter time ♪</i>

18:51.496 --> 18:56.199
<i>- Oh, Devon, it's beautiful.
- ♪ Any time with Lady Anne</i>

18:58.069 --> 19:02.205
<i>♪ If the sun should go away</i>

19:02.207 --> 19:07.177
<i>♪ The night would only have
to say ♪</i>

19:07.179 --> 19:12.215
<i>♪ Lady Anne,
Lady Anne ♪</i>

19:12.217 --> 19:18.121
<i>♪ Lady Anne</i>

19:18.123 --> 19:21.658
<i>♪ What is the measure</i>

19:23.961 --> 19:25.161
My sister Cynthia proved
to be

19:25.163 --> 19:26.196
<i>a savvy businesswoman.</i>

19:26.198 --> 19:30.033
<i>While I was away at war,
and while Father grew more ill,</i>

19:30.035 --> 19:32.101
<i>she guided the company
very well.</i>

19:32.103 --> 19:36.206
<i>She continued our profitable
association with the military</i>

19:36.208 --> 19:38.675
<i>with bigger
and bigger contracts.</i>

19:38.677 --> 19:40.543
<i>We expanded
into other markets...</i>

19:40.545 --> 19:43.179
<i>rubber and plastics,
synthetics and paints,</i>

19:43.181 --> 19:45.215
<i>and soybeans and toys.</i>

19:45.217 --> 19:48.718
And one day Father came to me
and asked me to take a drive.

19:48.720 --> 19:51.855
<i>I was sure he was too ill but he
wouldn't take no for an answer.</i>

19:51.857 --> 19:55.425
<i>We drove way out into the hills
to see an old friend of his</i>

19:55.491 --> 19:57.580
<i>named Seymour Luntz.</i>

20:03.668 --> 20:05.168
What is it?

20:05.170 --> 20:07.937
It's what dreams are made of.

20:07.939 --> 20:10.240
It looks like a carburetor.

20:10.242 --> 20:13.877
It is.
It's a carburetor.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.745
Mr. Luntz is being modest.

20:15.747 --> 20:19.983
This here is a magical dynamo
of engineering

20:19.985 --> 20:23.987
and mechanical wizardry
that will topple nations

20:23.989 --> 20:27.290
and transport souls.

20:27.292 --> 20:30.894
Well, what kind
of carburetor is it?

20:30.896 --> 20:34.597
Well, I modified it.
It runs on steam.

20:34.599 --> 20:36.966
I get 200 miles a gallon
with this.

20:36.968 --> 20:38.234
That's impossible.

20:42.240 --> 20:45.241
You need some rest, father.

20:45.243 --> 20:47.844
Nonsense! I'm fine.

20:47.846 --> 20:51.648
- Who else knows about this?
- Nobody.

20:51.650 --> 20:54.250
You understand?

20:54.252 --> 20:56.252
This is my legacy.

20:56.254 --> 20:59.022
Our gift to the world.

20:59.024 --> 21:00.089
When can it be ready?

21:00.091 --> 21:02.025
I gotta get
a different metal on it,

21:02.027 --> 21:03.259
heats up too fast.

21:03.261 --> 21:04.227
Sorry?

21:04.229 --> 21:05.895
I gotta get a different metal,
use a different metal on it

21:05.897 --> 21:07.997
so it... it heats up too fast,
it gonna get melty.

21:07.999 --> 21:08.998
Seymour needs time.

21:09.000 --> 21:14.003
This thing will destroy
the oil industry.

21:14.005 --> 21:16.306
It will revolutionize
the auto industry.

21:16.308 --> 21:21.277
No one must know about this
until we are ready.

21:21.279 --> 21:23.680
No...

21:23.682 --> 21:25.281
one.

21:25.283 --> 21:28.579
It will be...
our gift...

21:29.205 --> 21:30.671
to mankind.

21:38.295 --> 21:40.897
Well, there it is.

21:44.736 --> 21:47.337
The story continues
the next time.

21:47.339 --> 21:50.206
I'll be here waiting
for you...

21:50.208 --> 21:51.841
Probably in this same booth

21:51.843 --> 21:55.311
with the same moribund look
on my face.

21:55.313 --> 21:57.714
How could it be otherwise?

21:57.716 --> 22:02.352
Doris, would you like
to have lunch with me?

22:02.354 --> 22:03.353
Hmm.

22:03.355 --> 22:07.323
Doris, can you pour the wine
into my mouth for me?

22:07.325 --> 22:09.325
What year is this?

22:09.327 --> 22:11.327
What's that?

22:15.266 --> 22:16.933
I should hardly think so.

22:16.935 --> 22:19.902
I owned a race car
in those days. I did.

22:19.904 --> 22:22.972
I raced in Monte Carlo
that year.

22:22.974 --> 22:25.775
However it wasn't on race day.

22:25.777 --> 22:27.810
It's a miracle
no one was hurt.

22:29.080 --> 22:31.681
Absolute miracle.

22:31.683 --> 22:33.950
I deserve this.

22:33.952 --> 22:36.019
You've worked hard today.

22:36.206 --> 22:39.746
Don't take the bottle, Doris.
I wasn't done with that.
