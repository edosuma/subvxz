WEBVTT

00:01.627 --> 00:04.630
*

00:12.305 --> 00:14.507
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.

00:14.540 --> 00:16.976
Is something wrong with
your uniform, Lieutenant?

00:17.010 --> 00:19.378
Well, I went for a jog in the
simulator, lost track of time,

00:19.412 --> 00:21.014
figured I should get
to my shift,

00:21.047 --> 00:22.782
but I'll go get changed
if you want.

00:22.816 --> 00:24.217
Yeah, why don't you
go get changed?

00:24.250 --> 00:26.619
-All right.
-He's got the night shift.

00:26.652 --> 00:28.054
He's fine.
Tharl, you're fine.

00:28.087 --> 00:30.056
Righteous.

00:30.089 --> 00:31.858
Mellow alert.
(chuckling)

00:35.995 --> 00:38.231
You've been very relaxed lately.

00:38.264 --> 00:40.566
Why, am I not usually relaxed?

00:40.599 --> 00:42.468
No, it's just...
you seem a little different.

00:42.501 --> 00:44.037
Like, your mood is different.

00:44.070 --> 00:46.840
I'm just doing my job,
nothing new.

00:46.873 --> 00:48.708
Okay.

00:48.742 --> 00:50.376
-I mean, I can be
more uptight if that...
-No, no,

00:50.409 --> 00:53.179
it's-it's great to see.
In fact,

00:53.212 --> 00:54.914
maybe now's a good time
to let you know

00:54.948 --> 00:56.549
that we've been asked
to make a supply run

00:56.582 --> 00:58.818
-to Epsilon Five.
-Again?

00:58.852 --> 01:01.755
God, it seems like all we do
lately is deliver supplies.

01:01.788 --> 01:04.057
Their synthesizers are down,
and we're the closest ship.

01:04.090 --> 01:06.359
Yeah, but we're supposed to be
out here exploring.

01:06.392 --> 01:08.527
Instead, we're the pizza guy.

01:09.528 --> 01:11.064
Captain,

01:11.097 --> 01:13.032
I finished the dark matter
survey you requested.

01:13.066 --> 01:14.934
It covers a radius
of 25 parsecs.

01:14.968 --> 01:16.402
Thank you, Lieutenant.

01:16.435 --> 01:17.703
Will there be
anything else, sir?

01:17.737 --> 01:18.972
That'll be all. Thanks.

01:23.810 --> 01:26.179
You know, I think I might
knock off early tonight.

01:26.212 --> 01:27.613
It's kind of quiet up here.

01:27.646 --> 01:29.348
All good.
I'll see you in the morning.

01:29.382 --> 01:31.117
All right.

01:39.658 --> 01:42.128
-Here we go.
-(indistinct singing)

01:42.161 --> 01:43.629
Scotch and popcorn.

01:43.662 --> 01:46.065
-Perfect pairing.
-Yes.

01:46.099 --> 01:47.533
What did I miss?

01:47.566 --> 01:48.968
He's still singing
with his shirt off.

01:49.002 --> 01:50.436
Ah.

01:50.469 --> 01:52.605
Oh, this is great right here.
Watch this.

01:52.638 --> 01:56.742
* Is a danger to be trusting
one another *

01:56.776 --> 02:01.380
* One will seldom want to do
what other wishes *

02:01.414 --> 02:03.316
* But unless someday *

02:03.349 --> 02:07.553
* Somebody trusts somebody *

02:07.586 --> 02:11.224
* There'll be nothing left
on Earth *

02:11.257 --> 02:14.961
-* Excepting fishes *
-(laughs)

02:14.994 --> 02:16.595
How many times
have you seen this?

02:16.629 --> 02:18.097
(chuckling):
Uh, a lot.

02:18.131 --> 02:19.732
Uh, my parents felt
it was important

02:19.765 --> 02:22.768
to expose me to the classics.
So, yeah.

02:22.802 --> 02:24.270
You know, you got to pick
a movie some night.

02:24.303 --> 02:25.638
I feel like I'm always
the one doing it.

02:25.671 --> 02:27.673
Well, you're doing good so far.

02:27.706 --> 02:30.776
What was that one you showed me
about the taxi driver?

02:30.810 --> 02:33.246
-Taxi Driver.
-Yeah, what was that called?

02:33.279 --> 02:35.281
Yeah, it was...
it was called Taxi Driver.

02:35.314 --> 02:38.918
Oh, right, yeah.
I liked that one.

02:38.952 --> 02:41.254
Oh, it's chilly in here.

02:41.287 --> 02:43.289
It's the environmental controls.

02:43.322 --> 02:45.992
I keep telling John
he's got to fix 'em.

02:46.025 --> 02:47.693
Here you go.

02:49.128 --> 02:50.596
Thanks.

02:50.629 --> 02:55.468
* Oh, sometimes I think
that people going mad *

02:55.501 --> 02:56.802
* Oh... *

02:56.836 --> 02:58.437
You know,

02:58.471 --> 03:01.007
it's getting harder and harder
to keep this quiet.

03:01.040 --> 03:04.277
Lieutenant Morris told me today
I have a glow.

03:04.310 --> 03:06.980
Yeah, Kelly said
something similar.

03:07.013 --> 03:09.415
I wonder if it's time
to be open about it.

03:10.549 --> 03:11.951
You know what'd be great?

03:11.985 --> 03:13.853
What?

03:13.887 --> 03:15.488
We should take a trip.

03:15.521 --> 03:18.291
When was the last time
you actually had time off?

03:18.324 --> 03:20.894
Not since I took command
of the Orville.

03:20.927 --> 03:22.661
Well, then you're way overdue.

03:22.695 --> 03:25.531
And remember,
you're dating a cartographer.

03:25.564 --> 03:28.634
I know all the best
vacation spots.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.870
Does sound nice.

03:30.904 --> 03:32.872
So, what do you say?

03:32.906 --> 03:34.573
Shall we go public?

03:35.708 --> 03:37.343
Let me sleep on it?

03:43.782 --> 03:46.785
*

04:54.020 --> 04:55.554
Janel?

04:55.588 --> 04:58.424
-Like, Lieutenant Janel?
-Yeah.

04:58.457 --> 05:01.594
Like, smoking-hot dark matter
cartographer Janel?

05:01.627 --> 05:03.896
Yeah, I just want to make sure
you're okay with it.

05:03.929 --> 05:07.900
Yeah. Yeah, no, no.
It's-it's all good.

05:07.933 --> 05:09.835
'Cause I know you had a thing
for her at one time,

05:09.868 --> 05:11.404
-and if it bothers you
at all, it's...
-Oh, no,

05:11.437 --> 05:12.938
dude, it was just a crush.

05:12.972 --> 05:15.574
I'm totally good. Okay?
To be honest,

05:15.608 --> 05:17.610
I've been wanting to see you
get back on your feet

05:17.643 --> 05:19.245
ever since the divorce, so...

05:19.278 --> 05:21.014
if she makes you happy,
I love it.

05:21.047 --> 05:22.481
Yeah, she does.

05:22.515 --> 05:24.283
She's cool, she's smart,
she's funny.

05:24.317 --> 05:25.918
She-she checks every box.

05:25.951 --> 05:27.920
I've never met a woman
who checked every box.

05:27.953 --> 05:29.655
You said Kelly
checked every box.

05:29.688 --> 05:31.924
Yeah, well, I got more boxes
now. She checks those, too.

05:31.957 --> 05:34.693
-Can I add a box?
-Sure.

05:34.727 --> 05:36.762
Your best friend approves.

05:36.795 --> 05:38.564
Thanks, man.

05:39.632 --> 05:41.934
Have you guys done it yet?

05:41.967 --> 05:44.537
Have... have we done it?

05:44.570 --> 05:47.173
(chuckling):
You allowed to use that phrase

05:47.206 --> 05:49.375
-after the age of 12?
-Well, have you?

05:49.408 --> 05:50.509
Look, there's something
more important

05:50.543 --> 05:51.944
I want to talk to you about.

05:51.977 --> 05:54.013
I think I'm gonna tell Kelly.

05:54.047 --> 05:55.481
Really?

05:55.514 --> 05:57.183
Yeah, you think
that's a good idea?

05:57.216 --> 05:59.318
Well, she's got a guy
of her own, anyway,

05:59.352 --> 06:00.819
and if you guys are serious,

06:00.853 --> 06:02.288
she's gonna find out
sooner or later.

06:02.321 --> 06:05.191
Yeah, you should tell her.

06:12.765 --> 06:14.367
Oh, hey, Captain.

06:14.400 --> 06:17.070
Cassius. Is, uh, Kelly here?

06:17.103 --> 06:18.537
Yeah.

06:18.571 --> 06:20.039
Hey. What's up?

06:20.073 --> 06:22.875
Can I talk to you for a second?
Won't take long.

06:22.908 --> 06:24.543
Yeah, sure.

06:24.577 --> 06:26.179
-Do you mind?
-Hmm, all good.

06:26.212 --> 06:27.513
I have to grade papers anyway.

06:27.546 --> 06:29.148
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Okay.

06:29.182 --> 06:31.417
-Okay.
-Bye.

06:31.450 --> 06:33.186
Everything all right?

06:33.219 --> 06:34.653
ED:
Yeah, it is.

06:34.687 --> 06:37.090
Um...

06:37.123 --> 06:39.992
I just wanted to be the one
to tell you...

06:40.025 --> 06:42.495
I'm seeing Janel Tyler.

06:42.528 --> 06:43.929
I know.

06:43.962 --> 06:46.232
-What?
-Come on, really?

06:46.265 --> 06:48.734
I see the way you smile
when she walks onto the bridge.

06:48.767 --> 06:51.704
I know your smiles.
You have 15.

06:51.737 --> 06:55.007
Three are for happiness.
11 are passive-aggressive.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.443
And one is for being in love.

06:57.476 --> 06:59.011
I've seen it before, you know.

06:59.044 --> 07:00.513
What are you, Jane Goodall?

07:00.546 --> 07:02.248
Yeah, and you're the primate.

07:02.281 --> 07:03.949
Why didn't you say anything?

07:03.982 --> 07:07.019
I figured you would tell me
when you were ready.

07:07.052 --> 07:09.021
Plus, it's really none
of my business.

07:09.054 --> 07:12.091
Well, we were thinking
of taking a trip.

07:12.125 --> 07:14.227
I have some shore leave
piled up.

07:14.260 --> 07:16.595
Wow. You really do like
this woman.

07:16.629 --> 07:18.297
Sensoria Two is just a few
light-years away.

07:18.331 --> 07:20.466
We could hop on a shuttle
first thing in the morning.

07:20.499 --> 07:22.201
It's no problem.

07:22.235 --> 07:23.969
I'll handle the supply run.

07:24.002 --> 07:25.738
Thank you.

07:25.771 --> 07:27.773
Please, it's just
a quick delivery.

07:27.806 --> 07:29.942
No, I mean,

07:29.975 --> 07:34.079
thank you for being so cool
about this.

07:35.948 --> 07:37.916
Number four.

07:37.950 --> 07:40.186
("Don't Ask Me Why"
by Billy Joel playing)

07:42.188 --> 07:46.792
* All the waiters
in your grand cafÃ© *

07:46.825 --> 07:50.429
* Leave their tables
when you blink *

07:50.463 --> 07:51.964
* Oh *

07:51.997 --> 07:55.668
* Every dog must have
his every day... *

07:55.701 --> 07:57.803
You okay back there?

07:57.836 --> 07:59.738
Forgot my toiletries.
Can you believe that?

07:59.772 --> 08:01.340
Toothbrush, shaving cream,
shampoo, all of it.

08:01.374 --> 08:03.276
Synthesize new ones.

08:03.309 --> 08:05.611
I-I can't. I have this
special floss that I use

08:05.644 --> 08:06.979
from Navidian micro-silk.

08:07.012 --> 08:08.781
I have very tight spaces
between my teeth.

08:08.814 --> 08:11.850
-I don't know if you noticed.
-(chuckling): No, I hadn't.

08:11.884 --> 08:14.387
Come on up here
and look at the nebula.

08:16.789 --> 08:18.191
Oh, wow, look at that.

08:18.224 --> 08:19.592
Isn't that pretty?

08:19.625 --> 08:21.093
That is really something.

08:21.126 --> 08:23.596
What are we listening to, again?

08:23.629 --> 08:25.798
This? This is, uh, Billy Joel.

08:25.831 --> 08:27.800
-Earth guy?
-Old Earth.

08:27.833 --> 08:29.668
Yeah, like 400 years ago.

08:29.702 --> 08:32.171
You're not really into
that kind of stuff, are you?

08:33.406 --> 08:35.541
I'm into anything
we do together.

08:35.574 --> 08:38.043
Well, you know what,
I'm glad we did this.

08:38.076 --> 08:40.112
Me too.
And I'm relieved

08:40.145 --> 08:42.147
Commander Grayson
doesn't hate me. (chuckles)

08:42.181 --> 08:43.549
No, she does not hate you.

08:43.582 --> 08:45.184
In fact, she told me that she...

08:45.218 --> 08:46.952
(beeping)

08:46.985 --> 08:48.187
What is it?

08:48.221 --> 08:50.223
ED:
It's a convoy.

08:50.256 --> 08:53.158
About 20,000 kilometers
off the starboard bow.

08:55.194 --> 08:56.695
JANEL:
Oh, my God.

08:56.729 --> 08:58.397
Ed, they're Krill.

08:58.431 --> 09:01.800
Yeah. Three marauder-class
fighters, closing fast.

09:01.834 --> 09:04.237
I'm taking evasive maneuvers.
Stand by to cloak.

09:08.241 --> 09:09.542
Engage cloak.

09:15.948 --> 09:17.616
They're still closing.

09:18.951 --> 09:20.386
10,000 kilometers.

09:20.419 --> 09:22.655
5,000.

09:22.688 --> 09:24.089
2,000.

09:24.122 --> 09:25.458
Here they come.

09:37.403 --> 09:41.240
(exhales) A little excitement
to start the trip, huh?

09:41.274 --> 09:43.942
Yeah, I think I'm gonna need
a massage when we get there.

09:43.976 --> 09:45.678
Yeah.

09:45.711 --> 09:48.581
There shouldn't be any
Krill activity in this sector.

09:48.614 --> 09:50.182
Should we warn Union Central?

09:50.215 --> 09:51.984
Let's wait till they're
out of range first.

09:55.488 --> 09:57.790
Ed, they're turning around.

09:59.758 --> 10:02.395
All right. It's okay.
They still can't see us.

10:02.428 --> 10:04.597
Then why the hell
are they coming back?

10:16.241 --> 10:18.711
They're venting drive plasma.

10:18.744 --> 10:20.446
Oh, no.

10:36.128 --> 10:38.497
-I'm raising deflectors.
-They're targeting our engines.

10:45.203 --> 10:48.173
-You okay?
-Yeah, I think so. You?

10:48.206 --> 10:49.608
Power's almost gone.

10:50.643 --> 10:52.378
Look.

11:12.665 --> 11:14.800
Oh, my God, we're in trouble.

11:28.046 --> 11:29.882
Thought you'd be glad to know

11:29.915 --> 11:32.217
they've finally assigned us
a new security chief.

11:32.250 --> 11:34.720
-She'll be here next week.
-There are many on board

11:34.753 --> 11:36.855
who will be pleased
to know this.

11:36.889 --> 11:38.457
Tharl driving you crazy, too?

11:38.491 --> 11:41.226
He does not stop talking,

11:41.259 --> 11:44.329
and he makes loud noises
when he consumes food.

11:44.363 --> 11:48.367
He comes to the mess hall
wearing... sandals.

11:48.401 --> 11:50.002
(door chimes)

11:50.035 --> 11:51.203
Come in.

11:53.105 --> 11:55.574
Oh, if you guys are busy,
I can come back later.

11:55.608 --> 11:57.042
Not at all.
What's up?

11:57.075 --> 11:59.745
(clears throat)
Commander, I would like

11:59.778 --> 12:02.214
to formally submit a request
to be considered

12:02.247 --> 12:04.517
for the Shipmaster
Qualification Program.

12:04.550 --> 12:06.819
You want to take
the command test?

12:06.852 --> 12:08.754
I-I've been thinking about it
for a while now,

12:08.787 --> 12:11.223
and I'm ready to move up
in the ranks.

12:11.256 --> 12:13.526
Maybe even have my own ship
one day.

12:13.559 --> 12:14.993
What brought this on?

12:15.027 --> 12:16.895
Look, I-I love flying,

12:16.929 --> 12:18.897
but it's all I've ever done.

12:18.931 --> 12:21.867
I have 56,000 light-years
under my belt.

12:21.900 --> 12:23.736
Well, you're one
of the best pilots in the fleet.

12:23.769 --> 12:25.671
Yeah, but that's the problem--
you do one thing well,

12:25.704 --> 12:27.239
and they expect you
to do it forever.

12:27.272 --> 12:29.675
You realize that
there's a tremendous amount

12:29.708 --> 12:30.776
of training involved.

12:30.809 --> 12:32.244
Course work, simulator runs,

12:32.277 --> 12:33.679
psychological testing.

12:33.712 --> 12:34.680
Yeah, bring it on.

12:34.713 --> 12:35.681
I'm ready.

12:35.714 --> 12:37.516
Okay.

12:37.550 --> 12:41.119
Well, first, you'll need
a medical and psych evaluation.

12:41.153 --> 12:43.388
I'll tell Dr. Finn
to expect you.

12:43.422 --> 12:44.790
Thank you, Commander.

12:44.823 --> 12:46.959
I won't let you down.

12:46.992 --> 12:49.762
Future captain right here.
(chuckles)

12:52.465 --> 12:54.633
He will fail.

13:08.346 --> 13:10.348
(door whooshes open)

13:17.355 --> 13:20.258
Welcome aboard, Captain.

13:20.292 --> 13:21.627
Where's Janel?

13:21.660 --> 13:23.261
You will not ask questions.

13:23.295 --> 13:25.163
You will answer them.

13:25.197 --> 13:26.799
What questions?

13:26.832 --> 13:28.400
Your command codes.

13:28.433 --> 13:29.802
I want them.

13:29.835 --> 13:31.269
I want to see Janel.

13:31.303 --> 13:32.838
(chuckles)

13:32.871 --> 13:36.308
I am capable of causing you
great pain, Captain.

13:42.314 --> 13:45.117
Look, my command codes
wouldn't be any good to you.

13:45.150 --> 13:46.652
We're not on a Union ship.

13:46.685 --> 13:48.654
Your shuttle's computer
can be used to access

13:48.687 --> 13:50.022
the Union deployment strategies.

13:50.055 --> 13:51.023
I want the codes!

13:51.056 --> 13:53.291
I'm not a fleet admiral.

13:53.325 --> 13:55.794
Okay, even if I gave them
to you, I don't have clearance

13:55.828 --> 13:57.429
for that level
of classified information.

13:57.462 --> 13:58.664
(snarls)

14:02.467 --> 14:03.468
(beep)

14:06.539 --> 14:09.307
(Janel panting)

14:14.179 --> 14:15.948
What are you doing?

14:15.981 --> 14:17.282
The command codes.

14:17.315 --> 14:19.051
(shouting, crying)

14:19.084 --> 14:20.452
No, stop, stop.
We can talk.

14:20.485 --> 14:22.855
We are talking.

14:22.888 --> 14:24.422
The codes, Captain!

14:25.423 --> 14:26.559
(screams)

14:26.592 --> 14:27.860
Look, I can't just...

14:27.893 --> 14:29.394
A Krill can survive
up to level 8.

14:29.427 --> 14:30.896
Humans are less resilient.

14:30.929 --> 14:32.798
Go to level 6.

14:32.831 --> 14:34.032
Okay...

14:34.066 --> 14:35.300
(straining)

14:35.333 --> 14:37.703
CAPTAIN:
I can see that this is

14:37.736 --> 14:39.371
-torture for you as well.
-(Janel whimpering)

14:39.404 --> 14:40.539
Level 9!

14:40.573 --> 14:42.207
Stop! Just let her go, okay?

14:42.240 --> 14:44.042
I'll give you the codes.
All right? I'll give 'em to you.

14:53.185 --> 14:54.720
Alpha Charlie

14:54.753 --> 14:56.555
27 Gamma

14:56.589 --> 14:59.157
42 Delta 6.

14:59.191 --> 15:02.360
If you're lying,

15:02.394 --> 15:04.529
she dies.

15:09.267 --> 15:10.636
(Janel whimpering)

15:27.886 --> 15:29.855
I didn't think I'd be
this nervous. (chuckles)

15:29.888 --> 15:32.625
It's like...
like the first day of school.

15:32.658 --> 15:35.127
Well, just relax. There are
no right or wrong answers.

15:35.160 --> 15:38.096
Now, I'm going to show you
a series of different shapes,

15:38.130 --> 15:40.265
and I want you to tell me
what you see.

15:40.298 --> 15:42.367
Just say the first thing
that comes to mind.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.401
Got it.

15:47.740 --> 15:50.442
Yeah, I, uh...

15:50.475 --> 15:52.477
I'd rather not say.

15:52.510 --> 15:53.746
Why not?

15:53.779 --> 15:56.481
It's... kind of embarrassing.

15:56.514 --> 15:58.483
Can we move on to the next one?

15:58.516 --> 16:00.418
All right.

16:00.452 --> 16:01.586
What do you see?

16:01.620 --> 16:04.156
Oh, man, that is disgusting.

16:04.189 --> 16:06.291
This is all confidential.
No judgment.

16:06.324 --> 16:07.760
That's even worse
than the last one.

16:07.793 --> 16:09.394
-What do you see?
-Let's move on!

16:09.427 --> 16:10.595
Moving on.

16:10.629 --> 16:13.165
My God, who makes these things?!

16:13.198 --> 16:15.067
Okay, try this.

16:15.100 --> 16:16.669
Okay, this is
a hostile work environment.

16:16.702 --> 16:19.337
I suggest you move on
to the simulator test.

16:19.371 --> 16:20.773
We can get back to this.

16:20.806 --> 16:22.641
Can I have a drink of water?

16:29.782 --> 16:31.684
(door whooshes open)

16:46.398 --> 16:48.500
I've been looking forward
to this moment

16:48.533 --> 16:50.335
for a very long time.

16:51.870 --> 16:53.839
Teleya.

16:53.872 --> 16:55.507
You seem surprised.

16:55.540 --> 16:58.310
Did you really think
we would not meet again?

16:58.343 --> 16:59.444
Where's Janel?

16:59.477 --> 17:00.645
I gave you the codes.

17:00.679 --> 17:01.814
I want to see her.

17:01.847 --> 17:03.816
Lieutenant Tyler?

17:03.849 --> 17:05.818
That would be difficult.

17:05.851 --> 17:08.286
She no longer exists.

17:08.320 --> 17:10.388
What do you mean?

17:10.422 --> 17:12.991
She never existed.

17:13.025 --> 17:15.393
(in Janel's voice):
"We should take a trip.

17:15.427 --> 17:18.831
When was the last time
you actually had time off?"

17:21.099 --> 17:23.535
Janel.

17:34.379 --> 17:37.249
I know how this
must feel, Captain.

17:37.282 --> 17:38.884
The humiliation,

17:38.917 --> 17:40.886
the confusion.

17:40.919 --> 17:45.657
It is just as I felt
when you infiltrated my ship.

17:45.690 --> 17:48.360
You offered kindness,

17:48.393 --> 17:52.230
all the while preparing
to murder my entire crew.

17:52.264 --> 17:53.866
(exhales)

17:53.899 --> 17:55.768
You were human.

17:55.801 --> 17:58.203
Transcellular micrografting.

17:58.236 --> 18:01.706
An extremely painful process,
but the only way to fool

18:01.740 --> 18:04.276
your bio-scanners.

18:05.310 --> 18:08.280
I am an idiot.

18:08.313 --> 18:11.583
For once, we agree.

18:11.616 --> 18:14.920
So, none of it was real.

18:14.953 --> 18:17.722
Your background,
your service record.

18:17.756 --> 18:19.557
An invention.

18:19.591 --> 18:23.128
Lieutenant Tyler was designed
to be the ideal Union officer.

18:23.161 --> 18:25.463
And the perfect lure.

18:25.497 --> 18:27.232
Well done.

18:27.265 --> 18:29.134
It was not difficult.

18:29.167 --> 18:32.104
You are simplistic
and easily manipulated.

18:32.137 --> 18:35.740
I don't... I don't understand.
You were a teacher.

18:35.774 --> 18:39.411
After I was interrogated
by your Union, I escaped.

18:39.444 --> 18:41.646
-How?
-That is unimportant.

18:41.679 --> 18:44.883
I chose not to return
to my post.

18:44.917 --> 18:47.752
To become a soldier
in the divine fight.

18:47.786 --> 18:50.155
When I was assigned
to this vessel,

18:50.188 --> 18:54.226
I learned of the plan
to capture a Union captain.

18:54.259 --> 18:56.294
I volunteered for the mission.

18:56.328 --> 18:59.264
Choosing you was my idea.

18:59.297 --> 19:02.567
So, what, what,
do you just... want revenge?

19:02.600 --> 19:07.072
The Anhkana teaches that
vengeance is the will of Avis.

19:07.105 --> 19:09.842
His will shall be done.

19:11.543 --> 19:13.078
What's going on?

19:13.111 --> 19:14.746
We are under attack.

19:14.779 --> 19:17.182
*

19:42.307 --> 19:44.142
What's the fastest way
to your shuttle bay?

19:47.812 --> 19:49.047
This way.

20:03.661 --> 20:05.063
MALE (over comm):
Ha'jakuvo! Me'skah!

20:05.097 --> 20:06.831
We've been boarded.

20:23.949 --> 20:26.684
*

20:33.591 --> 20:37.229
We must find an escape pod.

20:50.909 --> 20:53.211
Emergency power is down.

20:54.879 --> 20:56.414
(grunting)

20:59.817 --> 21:02.220
(snarling)

21:17.102 --> 21:20.939
You realize we're sitting ducks
if they decide to come after us.

21:20.973 --> 21:24.309
The pod is programmed to seek
out the closest habitable world.

21:24.342 --> 21:25.777
(beeping)

21:25.810 --> 21:27.879
There's a planet
not far from here.

21:27.912 --> 21:29.481
Oxygen atmosphere.

21:50.468 --> 21:52.670
*

22:00.345 --> 22:02.947
(creatures trilling
and chirping in distance)

22:04.349 --> 22:06.784
(footsteps sloshing)

22:24.469 --> 22:25.870
(grunts softly)

22:25.903 --> 22:27.505
-(weapon cocks)
-Get up.

22:34.079 --> 22:36.314
(groans softly)

22:40.185 --> 22:42.987
I was not able to transmit
a distress signal.

22:43.021 --> 22:46.458
The magnetic ore in this valley
is causing interference.

22:46.491 --> 22:48.560
We must seek higher ground.

22:48.593 --> 22:50.728
You will carry that.

23:06.578 --> 23:08.546
Who the hell were those guys?

23:08.580 --> 23:09.981
The Chak'tal.

23:10.014 --> 23:12.350
They reside on the border
of Krill space.

23:12.384 --> 23:14.486
Why did they attack you?

23:14.519 --> 23:15.887
We destroyed
one of their colonies

23:15.920 --> 23:17.889
during our expansion
into that sector.

23:17.922 --> 23:21.693
It is ours by divine right,
but they do not see this.

23:21.726 --> 23:24.596
They are savage
and do not retreat.

23:24.629 --> 23:27.399
And they never leave survivors.

23:27.432 --> 23:29.601
(distant booming)

23:33.037 --> 23:35.107
They will be here soon.
Move.

24:00.298 --> 24:02.134
Sir, the Krill are hailing us.

24:02.167 --> 24:03.535
Put 'em on.

24:03.568 --> 24:07.105
You will release
the prisoners immediately.

24:07.139 --> 24:08.540
They were part
of a raiding party

24:08.573 --> 24:10.408
that nearly destroyed
one of our outposts.

24:10.442 --> 24:12.744
Now, I can release them to you,

24:12.777 --> 24:14.746
but only if your people agree

24:14.779 --> 24:17.315
to establish diplomatic channels
so that we all can...

24:17.349 --> 24:19.551
There will be no negotiations!

24:19.584 --> 24:21.819
Comply with my demands

24:21.853 --> 24:23.821
or we will open fire.

24:23.855 --> 24:26.124
Okay, see, let me...

24:26.158 --> 24:28.893
let me tell you
why that is a terrible idea.

24:28.926 --> 24:31.563
We've recently installed

24:31.596 --> 24:34.566
a crazy new deflector

24:34.599 --> 24:36.968
that'll bounce back
anything you throw at us,

24:37.001 --> 24:40.638
so... you're basically
shooting yourself in the face.

24:40.672 --> 24:43.341
Our scans show no such device.

24:43.375 --> 24:45.743
Well... maybe not.

24:45.777 --> 24:48.646
But you know what we do have?

24:48.680 --> 24:51.249
We have... heart.

24:51.283 --> 24:54.919
Yeah, we got a...
lot of heart, lot of passion,

24:54.952 --> 24:57.088
you know, so watch out.

24:57.121 --> 25:00.091
You will release the prisoners
or you will die!

25:00.124 --> 25:01.593
Sir, they're charging weapons.

25:01.626 --> 25:03.961
We also eat a lot of protein.

25:03.995 --> 25:06.464
You know, fr...
fresh fruits and vegetables,

25:06.498 --> 25:08.633
that kind of thing,
very, very healthy diet.

25:08.666 --> 25:10.302
Makes us tough.

25:10.335 --> 25:12.970
You know, you don't want to mess
with that, trust me.

25:13.004 --> 25:14.439
Very little dairy.

25:14.472 --> 25:16.174
I mean, occasional sweet...

25:16.208 --> 25:17.709
(booming)

25:17.742 --> 25:19.911
(booming fades)

25:21.313 --> 25:23.147
End simulation.

25:26.418 --> 25:28.186
-You just blew up.
-(sighs) Sorry.

25:28.220 --> 25:30.121
I kind of choked there
at the end.

25:30.154 --> 25:32.156
Well, the deflector thing
was novel.

25:32.190 --> 25:34.326
I really thought
I had him this time.

25:34.359 --> 25:36.861
You're thinking on your feet,
so that's a start.

25:36.894 --> 25:38.696
I'm just not sure
that good digestion

25:38.730 --> 25:39.964
is a persuasive deterrent.

25:39.997 --> 25:41.165
Well, what am I doing wrong?

25:41.199 --> 25:42.800
I mean,
how can I beat this thing?

25:42.834 --> 25:44.369
I can't tell you that.

25:44.402 --> 25:47.205
There is a diplomatic solution,
but you have to find it.

25:47.239 --> 25:49.140
All right.
Well, let's go again.

25:49.173 --> 25:52.310
Why don't we call it a day,
come back fresh in the morning?

25:52.344 --> 25:54.178
Oh, come on.
I feel like I'm so close.

25:54.212 --> 25:56.180
Look, I appreciate
your enthusiasm,

25:56.214 --> 25:58.983
but you don't pass
the command test overnight.

25:59.016 --> 26:00.485
It can take months.

26:00.518 --> 26:02.153
Part of being a leader
is knowing

26:02.186 --> 26:03.521
when you've reached your limits.

26:03.555 --> 26:05.022
Right.

26:05.056 --> 26:07.259
Get some rest.
That's an order.

26:11.529 --> 26:13.265
(sighs)

26:19.237 --> 26:21.373
(creatures chittering,
hooting in distance)

26:21.406 --> 26:24.909
It's a lucky thing we hit
the night side of this place.

26:24.942 --> 26:26.711
TELEYA:
Our escape pods are programmed

26:26.744 --> 26:30.515
to seek out the night side
as a default.

26:30.548 --> 26:33.351
Must have been hard for you,
being on our ship.

26:33.385 --> 26:34.919
All those bright lights.

26:34.952 --> 26:36.554
I survived.

26:36.588 --> 26:39.023
So why don't you just kill me?

26:39.056 --> 26:41.559
You will carry the beacon
to high ground,

26:41.593 --> 26:43.295
then you will die.

26:46.398 --> 26:49.100
-Can I ask you something?
-What?

26:49.133 --> 26:52.136
Did you actually like
any of the movies I showed you

26:52.169 --> 26:53.971
or was that a lie, too?

26:54.005 --> 26:55.707
There was one.

26:55.740 --> 26:57.208
One?
One out of 20?

26:57.241 --> 26:59.210
Wow, tough audience.
Which one?

26:59.243 --> 27:00.978
The one about the Ark.

27:01.012 --> 27:03.881
Raiders of the Lost Ark.
You liked that one. Okay.

27:03.915 --> 27:05.450
That was the only one?

27:05.483 --> 27:07.452
I found the hero sympathetic.

27:07.485 --> 27:09.253
What was his name?

27:09.287 --> 27:10.622
Belloq.

27:11.656 --> 27:12.824
Belloq?

27:12.857 --> 27:14.292
That... those...

27:14.326 --> 27:16.461
those are the Nazis--
they were the bad guys.

27:16.494 --> 27:18.129
I have a question for you.

27:18.162 --> 27:19.564
What is it?

27:19.597 --> 27:23.501
Your command codes--
were they authentic?

27:23.535 --> 27:26.338
Decoys. You punch 'em
into your computer,

27:26.371 --> 27:28.172
it feeds you mountains
of fake data.

27:28.205 --> 27:30.408
Would have taken you weeks
to figure it out.

27:30.442 --> 27:32.444
I gambled
we'd be rescued by then.

27:32.477 --> 27:33.878
I see.

27:36.948 --> 27:38.583
Did you feel...

27:38.616 --> 27:40.251
anything at all?

27:40.284 --> 27:41.453
No.

27:41.486 --> 27:43.621
It was just your mission?

27:43.655 --> 27:45.523
To get close to me?

27:45.557 --> 27:46.824
That is correct.

27:46.858 --> 27:48.526
Man, I liked you a lot better

27:48.560 --> 27:50.161
when you were
using contractions.

27:50.194 --> 27:51.963
Move.

27:53.465 --> 27:54.766
I...

27:54.799 --> 27:57.001
We canoodled.
You canoodled with me.

27:57.034 --> 27:58.603
That was all fake?

27:58.636 --> 28:00.538
Janel was created to appeal

28:00.572 --> 28:03.274
to your desperation
for companionship.

28:03.307 --> 28:04.976
The interactions
were superficial.

28:05.009 --> 28:07.278
No. You're wrong.

28:07.311 --> 28:09.547
She was kind, she was funny,

28:09.581 --> 28:11.215
she was thoughtful. I...

28:11.248 --> 28:12.850
She made me
a grilled cheese sandwich.

28:12.884 --> 28:14.986
Why would you do that?
You didn't have to do that.

28:15.019 --> 28:16.954
You are a fool.

28:16.988 --> 28:19.023
I-I just can't believe
that there wasn't

28:19.056 --> 28:20.992
a single genuine moment
between us.

28:21.025 --> 28:22.794
I just can't believe that.

28:22.827 --> 28:26.063
If I was not going to kill you,
I would give you some advice.

28:26.097 --> 28:27.632
Please.
Love to hear it.

28:27.665 --> 28:30.468
You are painfully attentive.

28:30.502 --> 28:31.903
The failure of your marriage

28:31.936 --> 28:34.338
has caused you
to overcompensate in the moment.

28:34.372 --> 28:36.040
And yet, paradoxically,

28:36.073 --> 28:39.243
despite this, your work
remains your first priority.

28:39.276 --> 28:41.212
You have no balance.

28:41.245 --> 28:43.381
My God, you sound like
my ex-wife.

28:43.415 --> 28:45.383
You feel entitled
to educate others,

28:45.417 --> 28:48.420
but your own worldview
is self-defeatingly narrow.

28:48.453 --> 28:51.523
Yeah, well, at least
I know who Billy Joel is.

28:51.556 --> 28:52.690
(low growling, snarling)

29:15.913 --> 29:17.248
(sniffing)

29:23.621 --> 29:25.623
(low growling)

29:50.014 --> 29:51.616
What is it?

29:51.649 --> 29:52.784
Look.

29:53.818 --> 29:55.720
It'll be dawn soon.

29:55.753 --> 29:58.623
Then we must reach
high ground before then.

29:58.656 --> 30:00.758
There isn't time.
We got to be

30:00.792 --> 30:02.226
another thousand meters up
before we can

30:02.259 --> 30:04.161
send that distress signal.

30:04.195 --> 30:05.663
Then climb faster.

30:05.697 --> 30:07.164
Teleya, the sun will kill you.

30:07.198 --> 30:09.166
If I die, you die.

30:09.200 --> 30:11.302
Look, even if we could sprint
up this mountain,

30:11.335 --> 30:12.737
we'd never make it in time.

30:12.770 --> 30:14.572
We just have to find
some shelter

30:14.606 --> 30:16.608
and wait out the day.

30:16.641 --> 30:20.277
We can get some rest
and head out when the sun sets.

30:22.046 --> 30:25.182
There may be caves in the rock
formations below that ridge.

30:35.192 --> 30:37.795
Did I tell you
I'm taking the command test?

30:37.829 --> 30:39.163
-No way.
-Yep.

30:39.196 --> 30:40.197
That's amazing.

30:40.231 --> 30:42.033
Is it as tough as everyone says?

30:42.066 --> 30:44.435
Tougher.
But I'm feeling pumped.

30:44.468 --> 30:46.538
And killing it so far.

30:46.571 --> 30:48.706
-I'm impressed.
-Yeah, me, too.

30:48.740 --> 30:51.442
I mean, I'm happy
things are going so well.

30:51.475 --> 30:54.646
Well, make sure to invite me
to your promotion ceremony.

30:54.679 --> 30:57.348
Well, hey, why wait?
I mean, feel like having

30:57.381 --> 30:59.150
a drink later
with a future captain?

30:59.183 --> 31:01.619
Yeah, why not?

31:01.653 --> 31:03.054
Cool.

31:03.087 --> 31:05.222
Hey, Lieutenant.
Can I talk to you for a minute?

31:06.257 --> 31:07.324
Yes, sir.

31:07.358 --> 31:08.660
I'll catch you later.

31:10.161 --> 31:11.929
(clears throat)

31:13.430 --> 31:16.300
Gordon, why are you
taking the command test?

31:16.333 --> 31:18.369
I told you.
I want to branch out,

31:18.402 --> 31:19.671
move up in the ranks.

31:19.704 --> 31:20.805
Yeah, but why?

31:20.838 --> 31:22.574
To be more successful.

31:22.607 --> 31:24.676
And what does success
mean to you?

31:24.709 --> 31:26.177
You know, respect.

31:26.210 --> 31:27.679
So it's a status thing?

31:27.712 --> 31:29.981
Well, no. I mean,
that's not the whole...

31:30.014 --> 31:31.983
Are you doing this
to pick up chicks?

31:32.016 --> 31:33.685
What?

31:33.718 --> 31:35.519
Honesty is
a command requirement.

31:36.754 --> 31:38.055
Well, look...

31:38.089 --> 31:39.757
did it cross my mind?

31:39.791 --> 31:40.992
Sure.

31:41.025 --> 31:42.560
I mean,
wh-when you're the captain

31:42.594 --> 31:45.162
or the commander,
it changes how people see you.

31:45.196 --> 31:48.265
Gordon... this isn't some club
you join in high school

31:48.299 --> 31:50.267
to hang out with the cool kids.

31:50.301 --> 31:51.869
When you're in command,
you're making

31:51.903 --> 31:53.838
life-and-death decisions,
not dinner dates.

31:53.871 --> 31:56.440
Okay.
I can see I'm an open book,

31:56.473 --> 31:58.075
whether I want to be or not.

31:59.577 --> 32:02.113
I guess lately
I've been feeling...

32:02.146 --> 32:04.281
bored with myself.

32:04.315 --> 32:06.017
Like, is this all I am--

32:06.050 --> 32:08.786
a guy who drives ships
from one place to another?

32:08.820 --> 32:11.889
And if I'm not enough
for myself,

32:11.923 --> 32:13.791
what if that means...

32:13.825 --> 32:16.027
I'm not enough for other people?

32:16.060 --> 32:18.295
I hope you know that's not true.

32:18.329 --> 32:22.199
Look, just be sure you're doing
this for the right reasons.

32:22.233 --> 32:23.601
When you're in command,

32:23.635 --> 32:25.770
the last person
you think about is yourself.

32:25.803 --> 32:28.272
Make sense?

32:28.305 --> 32:30.107
And by the way,

32:30.141 --> 32:33.477
if your goal is to prove how
charming and awesome you are,

32:33.510 --> 32:35.246
as far as I'm concerned,

32:35.279 --> 32:37.548
you've already passed that test
with flying colors.

32:37.581 --> 32:39.516
Thanks, Commander.

32:52.596 --> 32:54.565
You don't have to point
that thing at me.

32:54.598 --> 32:56.133
I'm not going anywhere.

32:56.167 --> 32:58.169
That is correct.

32:58.202 --> 33:01.238
You know, at some point,
the Krill and the Union

33:01.272 --> 33:03.941
are gonna have to find
some common ground.

33:03.975 --> 33:07.945
If we don't, eventually one
of us is gonna be destroyed.

33:07.979 --> 33:10.114
There is no common ground.

33:11.783 --> 33:14.085
Don't you remember
The King and I?

33:14.118 --> 33:18.089
"Unless someday
somebody trusts somebody,

33:18.122 --> 33:20.758
there'll be nothing left
on Earth excepting fishes"?

33:20.792 --> 33:23.527
You lead a godless existence.

33:23.560 --> 33:25.496
You have no soul.

33:25.529 --> 33:29.433
You reject
the guiding hand of Avis.

33:29.466 --> 33:31.268
And without belief,

33:31.302 --> 33:33.637
there can be no moral code.

33:34.638 --> 33:36.307
I don't know about that.

33:36.340 --> 33:39.643
We seem to be doing
a lot less killing than you.

33:39.677 --> 33:41.813
My brother would disagree.

33:45.683 --> 33:48.786
You know I'm sorry for that.

33:48.820 --> 33:52.189
But he would have destroyed
a colony of 100,000 people.

33:52.223 --> 33:54.692
Your own scientists claim

33:54.726 --> 33:57.695
your species is just
another kind of animal.

33:57.729 --> 33:59.764
Animals have no souls.

34:00.832 --> 34:02.800
So, if I believed in Avis,

34:02.834 --> 34:04.668
then I would have a soul?

34:04.702 --> 34:06.303
No.

34:06.337 --> 34:09.974
Avis created the Krill
independently of all other life.

34:10.007 --> 34:13.711
And he created the universe
for our dominion alone.

34:13.745 --> 34:16.213
Look, from what we've seen,

34:16.247 --> 34:18.716
when planets
first achieve space travel

34:18.750 --> 34:21.485
and they venture out
into the galaxy

34:21.518 --> 34:24.255
and discover that
they're just one single species

34:24.288 --> 34:26.657
among a vast diversity
of life-forms,

34:26.690 --> 34:29.560
they usually react
in one of two ways.

34:29.593 --> 34:32.329
They embrace
and adapt to the fact

34:32.363 --> 34:34.932
that they're no longer
the center of the universe,

34:34.966 --> 34:37.769
or they ratchet up
their xenophobia.

34:37.802 --> 34:39.771
Now, from what I've learned
of your history,

34:39.804 --> 34:42.273
the Krill were
a lot less fanatical

34:42.306 --> 34:44.441
before you left your home world.

34:44.475 --> 34:47.278
You know nothing of our history.

34:47.311 --> 34:48.913
I know fear when I see it.

34:50.414 --> 34:52.249
You're afraid to accept the fact

34:52.283 --> 34:54.051
that your superiority

34:54.085 --> 34:56.287
may just be a comforting myth.

34:56.320 --> 34:59.590
Who are you
to lecture me about myths?

34:59.623 --> 35:02.894
You fell in love
with a woman who did not exist.

35:02.927 --> 35:05.562
(scoffs)

35:05.596 --> 35:07.531
You know what?

35:07.564 --> 35:09.566
She did exist.

35:09.600 --> 35:11.568
For me, anyway.

35:11.602 --> 35:14.906
And I think that there is
a lot more of her in you

35:14.939 --> 35:16.607
than you're willing to admit.

35:18.009 --> 35:20.744
And if she is
in there somewhere,

35:20.778 --> 35:22.413
tell her...

35:24.816 --> 35:27.251
...tell her I miss her.

35:33.357 --> 35:35.359
I'm gonna get some sleep.

35:48.039 --> 35:50.241
Lie on your side.

35:50.274 --> 35:52.176
What?

35:52.209 --> 35:55.913
When you sleep
on your back, you snore.

35:55.947 --> 35:57.949
It is irritating.

36:09.360 --> 36:11.795
(sighs)

36:13.497 --> 36:15.867
(creatures chirping in distance)

36:29.146 --> 36:31.548
(panting)

36:35.486 --> 36:37.021
TELEYA:
What are you doing?

36:37.054 --> 36:38.455
ED:
Change of plans.

36:38.489 --> 36:40.024
We can't wait for nightfall.

36:40.057 --> 36:41.658
Why not?

36:41.692 --> 36:43.827
I've been tracking
the position of the sun.

36:43.861 --> 36:46.730
It's barely moved half a degree
in the last hour.

36:46.763 --> 36:50.801
That means a day on this planet
is 23 Earth days long.

36:50.834 --> 36:53.237
I'm gonna have to do this alone.

36:53.270 --> 36:55.172
(panting):
No.

36:55.206 --> 36:57.208
We wait until dark again.

36:57.241 --> 37:00.077
We don't have enough rations
for three days, let alone 23.

37:00.111 --> 37:01.812
And it's only a matter of time

37:01.845 --> 37:03.414
before your friends
hunt us down.

37:03.447 --> 37:05.216
I said we wait.

37:05.249 --> 37:06.984
The sooner I can send
that distress call,

37:07.018 --> 37:08.352
the sooner we get rescued.

37:08.385 --> 37:11.488
I will not allow you
to leave me here.

37:11.522 --> 37:13.490
I'll come back.
You have my word.

37:13.524 --> 37:15.226
(panting)

37:15.259 --> 37:18.262
Why should I believe you?

37:18.295 --> 37:20.864
You have every reason
to let me die.

37:20.898 --> 37:22.599
Well, then...

37:22.633 --> 37:25.636
you can either shoot me
or trust me.

37:29.040 --> 37:31.208
I'll see you soon.

37:33.477 --> 37:35.879
(panting)

37:36.948 --> 37:39.183
(huffs)

37:39.216 --> 37:41.618
*

38:08.445 --> 38:10.847
*

38:29.266 --> 38:31.668
(trilling)

38:53.357 --> 38:55.126
(ringing)

38:55.159 --> 38:57.094
BORTUS:
Commander, I am picking up

38:57.128 --> 39:00.164
a distress signal
from Captain Mercer.

39:00.197 --> 39:02.099
On a Krill frequency.

39:02.133 --> 39:03.367
Krill?

39:03.400 --> 39:04.868
Track the coordinates.

39:04.901 --> 39:08.039
It is a planetary system
2.6 light-years away.

39:08.072 --> 39:09.706
Gordon, set a course.
Maximum speed.

39:09.740 --> 39:11.242
Aye, sir.

39:24.888 --> 39:27.224
*

39:48.679 --> 39:51.315
-They're coming. We got to go.
-Did you send the signal?

39:51.348 --> 39:53.350
Yeah. There are four of them
headed this way.

39:53.384 --> 39:54.985
I cannot go outside.

39:55.018 --> 39:56.253
The sunlight.

39:59.790 --> 40:02.193
*

40:19.143 --> 40:20.744
Come on.

40:33.890 --> 40:35.426
The distress signal is emanating

40:35.459 --> 40:37.194
from the fourth planet
in the system.

40:37.228 --> 40:38.662
Commander.

40:45.402 --> 40:47.571
A Krill ship.

40:47.604 --> 40:49.773
KELLY:
What's left of it.

40:49.806 --> 40:52.443
Gordon, Bortus, take a shuttle
and find the captain.

40:52.476 --> 40:53.644
Aye, Commander.

41:04.455 --> 41:06.723
I have located
the distress beacon.

41:06.757 --> 41:09.092
Bio-signs show one human,

41:09.126 --> 41:11.528
one Krill.

41:21.772 --> 41:23.574
There is no place to land.

41:23.607 --> 41:25.409
Don't worry,
I'll make it work.

41:25.442 --> 41:26.410
How?

41:26.443 --> 41:29.880
Hey, man, I'm a pilot.

41:36.487 --> 41:38.355
They found us.

41:38.389 --> 41:40.157
A Union shuttle.

41:40.191 --> 41:41.458
Yeah.

41:45.329 --> 41:46.963
What are you doing?

41:46.997 --> 41:50.100
I will not allow myself
to be taken prisoner.

41:50.133 --> 41:52.569
Teleya, don't do this.

41:57.808 --> 41:59.243
Give me the gun.

42:02.813 --> 42:04.915
Teleya, give me the damn gun.

42:21.598 --> 42:22.866
*

42:39.015 --> 42:41.184
I want to go on record here:
this is not right.

42:41.218 --> 42:42.419
Well, we'll find out.

42:42.453 --> 42:44.054
Ed, she impersonated
a Union officer,

42:44.087 --> 42:45.722
she abducted you,

42:45.756 --> 42:47.724
-and she could've killed you.
-I'm alive now.

42:47.758 --> 42:50.026
That does not change the fact
that she's an enemy combatant.

42:50.060 --> 42:51.595
This is for the admiralty
to decide.

42:51.628 --> 42:53.864
-You do not have the authority.
-Objection noted.

42:53.897 --> 42:56.567
-You could be court-martialed.
-Noted.

43:10.414 --> 43:13.550
Teleya, I want you
to contact your people.

43:13.584 --> 43:16.119
Tell 'em to send a ship
to come pick you up.

43:17.788 --> 43:19.790
I do not understand.

43:24.428 --> 43:26.563
I'm letting you go.

43:46.417 --> 43:48.985
Would you look at that.

43:49.019 --> 43:50.421
JOHN:
Not every day you see

43:50.454 --> 43:52.556
one of those
without its guns blazing.

43:52.589 --> 43:54.291
I don't understand
why Ed's doing this.

43:54.325 --> 43:56.593
The admirals are gonna
cut him to pieces.

43:56.627 --> 43:58.929
Maybe.
Maybe not.

43:58.962 --> 44:02.165
It all depends if they find
value in his decision.

44:02.198 --> 44:04.601
Yeah, but why take the risk?

44:04.635 --> 44:07.838
Especially for someone
who wanted you dead.

44:07.871 --> 44:10.841
Lieutenant, that's command.

44:12.208 --> 44:14.378
Still interested?

44:41.972 --> 44:43.974
*

45:08.599 --> 45:11.301
If you believe releasing me

45:11.334 --> 45:14.871
will somehow improve relations
between our people,

45:14.905 --> 45:17.374
you are indulging
another fantasy.

45:17.408 --> 45:19.543
Defect of my species.

45:19.576 --> 45:21.612
We never give up hope.

45:22.679 --> 45:25.582
Just do me a favor, okay?

45:25.616 --> 45:27.918
Take a message back
to your people:

45:27.951 --> 45:29.853
we can keep fighting each other

45:29.886 --> 45:31.455
or we can talk.

45:32.523 --> 45:34.591
Very well.

45:34.625 --> 45:35.926
Oh.

45:35.959 --> 45:37.528
This is for you.

45:37.561 --> 45:39.830
What is it?

45:39.863 --> 45:42.466
Best of Billy Joel.

45:51.708 --> 45:52.743
And...

45:52.776 --> 45:56.447
if you ever get the itch
to do movie night again,

45:56.480 --> 45:59.550
you know where to find me.

46:02.819 --> 46:04.988
("She's Always a Woman"
by Billy Joel playing)

46:09.560 --> 46:11.795
* She can kill with a smile *

46:11.828 --> 46:14.565
* She can wound with her eyes *

46:14.598 --> 46:17.267
* And she can ruin your faith *

46:17.300 --> 46:19.903
* With her casual lies *

46:19.936 --> 46:22.739
* And she only reveals *

46:22.773 --> 46:25.208
* What she wants you to see *

46:25.241 --> 46:27.978
* She hides like a child *

46:28.011 --> 46:31.815
* But she's always a woman
to me *

46:31.848 --> 46:34.585
*

46:34.618 --> 46:36.987
* Oh *

46:37.020 --> 46:41.324
* She takes care of herself *

46:41.357 --> 46:45.295
* She can wait if she wants *

46:45.328 --> 46:50.166
* She's ahead of her time *

46:51.468 --> 46:53.604
* Oh *

46:53.637 --> 46:58.108
* And she never gives out *

46:58.141 --> 47:01.512
* And she never gives in *

47:01.545 --> 47:05.949
* She just changes her mind *

47:05.982 --> 47:10.787
* She's frequently kind
and she's suddenly cool *

47:10.821 --> 47:13.123
* But she can do
as she pleases *

47:13.156 --> 47:16.126
* She's nobody's fool *

47:16.159 --> 47:18.428
* And she can't be convicted *

47:18.461 --> 47:21.097
* She's earned her degree *

47:21.131 --> 47:25.001
* And the most she will do
is throw shadows at you *

47:25.035 --> 47:30.140
* But she's always a woman
to me. *

47:30.173 --> 47:33.744
(Billy Joel humming)
