WEBVTT

01:58.243 --> 02:01.079
So where's the target?

02:01.788 --> 02:03.790
That's the dealer's hideout.

02:04.541 --> 02:05.375
Disgusting.

02:05.458 --> 02:07.377
He lives there?

02:07.460 --> 02:08.503
Fuck 'em up good!

02:13.675 --> 02:14.509
What?

02:18.847 --> 02:19.848
The fuck are you?

02:30.650 --> 02:31.484
Seriously?

02:31.568 --> 02:32.861
Awesome!

02:33.611 --> 02:35.947
Are these guys dead?

02:36.030 --> 02:39.200
They're not dead,
but they're basket cases now.

02:42.745 --> 02:44.205
Here's your share.

02:44.289 --> 02:47.041
That's the last time we'll work with you.

02:47.542 --> 02:49.544
What do you mean by that?

02:49.627 --> 02:52.297
You scare us, girl.

02:53.840 --> 02:59.178
Don't take it the wrong way!
To us, that kind of power is… You know…

03:00.388 --> 03:01.472
Jerks.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.394
Yeah.

03:06.978 --> 03:08.396
Let's split the haul evenly.

03:09.397 --> 03:12.025
You're that chick Kasey, aren't you?

03:12.108 --> 03:15.820
I heard you turned all your pals
into basket cases over money.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.865
What? That's disgusting. I never did that.

03:19.866 --> 03:20.867
Is that right?

03:22.452 --> 03:24.412
Sorry, but I ain't working with you.

03:28.958 --> 03:30.960
Fuck off, you big wuss!

03:37.258 --> 03:38.843
Don't hate yourself.

03:40.178 --> 03:41.304
Lay down some rules.

03:42.597 --> 03:45.141
What's with you? Buzz off, old man.

03:46.351 --> 03:48.686
Your power is a treasure
that only you have.

03:49.646 --> 03:50.939
How'd you know about my power?

03:51.481 --> 03:52.982
Love it.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.817
There's no need to hate it.

03:55.401 --> 03:59.489
But lay down rules
for who to use it on and who not to.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.908
Quit your lecturing!

04:02.617 --> 04:07.830
Then only work with people
who can intuitively understand you.

04:09.540 --> 04:10.750
That makes no sense.

04:11.292 --> 04:12.293
Enough of the lecture.

04:13.419 --> 04:15.838
You already understand what I mean.

04:18.132 --> 04:19.592
You're freakin' disgusting.

04:19.676 --> 04:20.593
So long.

04:33.564 --> 04:34.983
I've got a good job for you.

04:35.900 --> 04:38.486
It's something that only you can do.

04:39.195 --> 04:41.281
You understand, don't you?

04:42.573 --> 04:44.993
I think I just might understand.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.175
There we go.

05:01.259 --> 05:02.343
Honey. Sign the card…

05:03.011 --> 05:03.845
What's wrong?

05:03.928 --> 05:05.805
Oh, sure.

05:14.856 --> 05:15.982
There you go.

05:17.066 --> 05:19.360
Are you on your honeymoon?

05:19.444 --> 05:20.945
Can you tell?

05:21.029 --> 05:23.364
Congratulations, Mr. and Mrs. Brown.

05:23.448 --> 05:25.283
Welcome to the Plaza Hotel.

05:26.576 --> 05:27.660
Thanks.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.167
Sweetheart! Did you see the bathroom?

05:34.250 --> 05:37.128
There are mirrors everywhere!
Talk about sexy!

05:38.087 --> 05:39.005
Really?

05:39.589 --> 05:40.465
That's nice.

05:41.257 --> 05:43.885
What's that? Mr. and Mrs. Brown?

05:45.053 --> 05:46.971
But we're just a pretend married couple.

05:47.055 --> 05:49.307
Yeah, we are now, but…

05:49.390 --> 05:50.475
Do you mean…

05:51.059 --> 05:54.270
Around this time tomorrow,
it won't be pretend anymore.

05:55.813 --> 05:56.814
Kasey.

05:58.524 --> 06:00.777
Looks like we'll need to reserve a church.

06:00.860 --> 06:01.903
Johnny!

06:01.986 --> 06:05.823
Here. Tomorrow, our futures change.

06:05.907 --> 06:07.241
Let's celebrate early.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.577
We'll get out of this racket.

06:10.161 --> 06:14.624
We won't be spending our lives
in Supermax like those other villains.

06:27.345 --> 06:29.097
I won't ever let you go.

06:29.889 --> 06:30.973
Johnny…

06:31.557 --> 06:33.184
I'm gettin' an erection!

06:33.267 --> 06:34.393
Oh, you!

06:34.477 --> 06:36.562
Raw's okay, right, Kasey?

06:36.646 --> 06:38.356
Hey! Get the phone!

06:39.857 --> 06:40.775
Goddammit!

06:42.235 --> 06:47.073
Listen well! Get plenty of sleep
and don't drink a drop of liquor.

06:47.156 --> 06:48.199
If you…

06:48.950 --> 06:49.784
Johnny?

06:50.326 --> 06:51.244
What?

06:51.869 --> 06:53.037
He hung up on me.

06:55.331 --> 06:56.541
For god's sake!

06:57.291 --> 06:58.960
Chelsea?

07:00.378 --> 07:02.296
This place never changes.

07:04.966 --> 07:07.343
Here's to the skyscrapers.

07:14.058 --> 07:14.934
I can't sleep!

07:26.696 --> 07:27.822
Not bad.

07:38.416 --> 07:40.042
This carpet's really thick.

07:40.126 --> 07:40.960
Cut it out!

07:41.043 --> 07:42.295
They'll see through us!

07:42.378 --> 07:43.921
What will they see?

07:44.547 --> 07:46.007
That we're yokels.

07:46.757 --> 07:47.800
That's true.

07:48.968 --> 07:50.178
That hurts!

07:50.261 --> 07:51.179
Sorry.

07:52.388 --> 07:54.307
Cut it out! They'll see through us!

07:55.725 --> 07:56.893
That's true.

08:03.232 --> 08:04.692
Sheesh…

08:15.620 --> 08:19.832
Mommy! Wake up! It moved!

08:21.209 --> 08:22.835
The last train will be departing soon.

08:24.837 --> 08:26.589
Ouch! My back's killing me.

08:27.465 --> 08:29.133
Where's the darn hotel?

08:31.302 --> 08:33.012
Nine more hours?

08:47.693 --> 08:48.694
I'll take two.

08:49.278 --> 08:50.655
Two coming right up.

08:50.738 --> 08:52.198
Mustard?

08:52.281 --> 08:53.449
Thank you for coming.

08:57.745 --> 08:59.163
Thanks.

09:00.957 --> 09:02.875
Give me a hand out here.

09:05.169 --> 09:06.879
What is this? A one-man operation?

09:10.174 --> 09:11.008
Say…

09:11.717 --> 09:16.597
If it looks like those guys will kill me,
make me see a pleasant hallucination.

09:16.681 --> 09:21.018
I'll take you to Wonderland
with a nice little rabbit.

09:21.102 --> 09:22.353
That sounds nice.

09:22.436 --> 09:24.480
Where do you want her to take you?

09:25.439 --> 09:27.316
You want to be Christopher Robin?

09:28.109 --> 09:29.193
No, thanks.

09:29.277 --> 09:30.653
I don't need any hallucinations.

09:31.946 --> 09:37.118
You see, I want to see
the real Kasey up to the very end.

09:39.870 --> 09:40.997
Right?

09:42.039 --> 09:43.207
Oh, you.

09:43.749 --> 09:44.625
Sorry.

09:44.709 --> 09:47.670
I see you're already off in wonderland.

09:52.049 --> 09:53.301
Look!

09:59.098 --> 10:00.474
It's The Utopian!

10:03.227 --> 10:04.770
And that's Paragon!

10:04.854 --> 10:07.064
And of course, he's with Ruby Red.

10:07.148 --> 10:08.232
How lovely!

10:08.316 --> 10:10.192
They make such a great couple!

10:10.276 --> 10:12.194
What? Where's Brainwave?

10:12.278 --> 10:15.781
Didn't you know?
He's in China to get some kind of award.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.700
What? That's too bad.

10:19.285 --> 10:22.788
Of course,
the most popular is The Utopian,

10:22.872 --> 10:24.832
the leader of The Union of Justice.

10:24.915 --> 10:29.503
And for their regular meeting
to be held today, Lady Liberty,

10:29.587 --> 10:33.341
The Flare II, Paragon, Gladiator,

10:33.424 --> 10:37.386
Molecule Master,
and other superheroes have gathered here.

10:37.470 --> 10:41.891
There's a huge crowd in front of the HQ
hoping to catch sight of them.

10:42.516 --> 10:45.436
And who's the final arrival?
Oh, there he is!

10:45.519 --> 10:48.230
It's Praetorian.
His popularity has skyrocketed lately!

10:48.314 --> 10:53.444
That will be all from me here.
I'll send it back to the studio.

11:07.291 --> 11:08.876
Time to start the operation.

11:13.422 --> 11:14.757
"Thunder Fighter"?

11:15.549 --> 11:16.634
Never heard of him.

11:16.717 --> 11:18.386
Hold on a second!

11:18.469 --> 11:22.848
Oh, look at this!
It's The Necromancer's tomb.

11:22.932 --> 11:24.517
Let's get a picture of this.

11:24.600 --> 11:25.518
Okay!

11:26.602 --> 11:28.354
This will get tons of likes!

11:32.233 --> 11:34.068
Hey! What's happening?

11:41.575 --> 11:42.451
What's that?

11:42.535 --> 11:43.369
This is nuts.

12:26.203 --> 12:28.414
The Necromancer…

12:28.497 --> 12:30.708
Did you get a photo?

12:30.791 --> 12:31.667
No.

12:35.045 --> 12:37.047
We're patrolling Valley Street now.

12:37.965 --> 12:39.925
You see what?

12:40.551 --> 12:41.719
That's ridiculous!

12:41.802 --> 12:44.346
Leave those jokes for Halloween.

12:46.182 --> 12:50.603
Fine! Now just calm down!
I'll get backup! What? Bicycles?

12:50.686 --> 12:51.729
Hey!

12:52.688 --> 12:54.523
-Holy shit!
-Are you serious?

12:59.862 --> 13:02.948
This isn't the set of a movie!

13:03.032 --> 13:07.870
But it's still just like Dawn of the Dead!
This is unbelievable!

13:07.953 --> 13:09.205
Wait! What's that?

13:09.788 --> 13:13.042
That zombie is flying!

13:13.959 --> 13:16.962
What? In Pittsburgh? There's a what?

13:18.380 --> 13:21.800
We're interrupting this live broadcast
to bring you breaking news.

13:21.884 --> 13:25.679
The Necromancer is attacking
the downtown Pittsburgh area.

13:25.763 --> 13:27.181
The Necromancer was

13:27.264 --> 13:31.310
a notorious supervillain who used his
cursed powers to commit heinous crimes.

13:31.393 --> 13:36.065
But he died nine years ago
and was buried in a tomb in Pittsburgh…

13:36.148 --> 13:37.525
Look at that!

13:39.902 --> 13:42.238
The superheroes of

13:42.321 --> 13:47.368
our Union of Justice
have all just flown off for Pittsburg!

13:51.038 --> 13:52.373
That worked out well.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.584
So this is their HQ?

13:55.668 --> 13:56.961
Dang!

13:57.044 --> 13:59.922
I've wanted to come here
ever since I was a kid!

14:00.005 --> 14:01.048
Whoa!

14:01.131 --> 14:02.800
It's just like it looks on TV!

14:03.634 --> 14:05.678
Time to start our operation too.

14:06.262 --> 14:07.930
Don't get scared, Sammy.

14:08.013 --> 14:10.474
You too, buddy.
I hope you went to the bathroom.

14:10.558 --> 14:12.643
Yes, that's very important.

14:12.726 --> 14:13.894
Isn't that right, Johnny?

14:13.978 --> 14:16.564
Don't talk about that. Let's go!

14:18.482 --> 14:22.820
The plan is perfect.
Once we see the superheroes have left,

14:24.029 --> 14:26.782
we'll first disable the security system.

14:28.075 --> 14:32.288
Beforehand, we'll fabricate
security camera footage.

14:33.455 --> 14:38.752
Once we're done with our work,
nobody will even know that we were there.

14:39.336 --> 14:41.130
That's when Kasey comes in.

14:41.213 --> 14:43.632
After that,
we just need to find the spoils.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.343
But the time for doing that is limited.

14:46.844 --> 14:49.597
It all depends on how well their act goes.

15:06.155 --> 15:08.073
That's freakin' insane!

15:08.157 --> 15:10.075
What is this, Tour de Pittsburgh?

15:13.329 --> 15:16.957
But fast-moving zombies are so passé now.

15:18.042 --> 15:20.586
This would blow Romero away.

15:20.669 --> 15:23.047
Okay! In that case…

15:23.714 --> 15:25.174
Let there be light!

15:36.477 --> 15:38.646
Neither of us needs any special effects.

15:40.439 --> 15:42.608
It's the end of the world, ya know.

15:42.691 --> 15:43.525
Look.

15:44.526 --> 15:45.486
Here they come.

15:45.569 --> 15:47.738
That's superheroes for you.

15:48.322 --> 15:51.241
They're quick
when it comes to flashy trouble.

15:51.325 --> 15:52.242
Yeah.

15:52.326 --> 15:54.328
Now's when the real fun starts.

15:55.162 --> 15:57.539
-Later, dudes.
-I'll have caramel macchiato.

15:57.623 --> 15:59.750
Are you sure? Don't you have diabetes?

16:03.337 --> 16:06.090
All right, where is it? Find it!

16:06.966 --> 16:10.594
Hey!
This is Mister Rooster's Sword of Blood!

16:11.679 --> 16:15.057
Over here is Thunder Fighter's buckle!
Awesome!

16:15.140 --> 16:18.143
Seriously? Thunder Fighter?
Maybe they've got his mask too!

16:18.227 --> 16:20.813
Don't get distracted by that dumb stuff.

16:20.896 --> 16:22.231
It ain't dumb!

16:22.314 --> 16:25.192
They're villain wrestlers
that we villains look up to!

16:25.275 --> 16:27.027
Listen! What we're after is--

16:27.111 --> 16:30.864
Yeah, yeah. It's that thing
Count Orlok wants so badly.

16:31.448 --> 16:32.741
That cursed helmet, right?

16:33.325 --> 16:34.660
Hurry it up.

16:34.743 --> 16:36.704
I'm gradually losing my concentration.

16:36.787 --> 16:38.914
It'll be a piece of cake, partner.

16:39.498 --> 16:41.166
I'm counting on you, partner.

16:42.376 --> 16:43.627
This reminds me of

16:43.711 --> 16:46.964
the time we broke into that
creepy Chinese mobster's wine cellar.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.551
Don't screw up again
like you did that time.

16:55.305 --> 16:57.099
Time out. I gotta use the restroom.

16:57.182 --> 16:59.977
What? Are you kidding? You idiot!

17:02.938 --> 17:05.232
Oh, um…

17:05.816 --> 17:06.775
Who are…

17:12.448 --> 17:13.574
I must be seeing things.

17:14.575 --> 17:15.409
What?

17:16.827 --> 17:19.496
How's this? They're worth 100,000 dollars.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.792
But how come that guy didn't notice me?

17:23.876 --> 17:25.878
I made him hallucinate.

17:25.961 --> 17:28.797
Honey, you can do that? I never knew!

17:28.881 --> 17:31.967
That's right.
Want me to make you hallucinate too?

17:32.885 --> 17:35.721
Yeah, maybe not. I'm already

17:37.222 --> 17:39.641
totally spellbound by you.

17:42.436 --> 17:44.605
You're not afraid of my power?

17:46.231 --> 17:48.275
Why? It's totally cool!

17:54.907 --> 17:59.787
Oh, shut up. I got the runs that day
because of the tom yum the day before.

18:01.038 --> 18:02.331
What? There it is!

18:02.414 --> 18:04.458
We've found it! Ghost!

18:05.084 --> 18:07.836
Right. So this is the magical helmet?

18:07.920 --> 18:09.505
Leave this to me.

18:15.260 --> 18:16.762
Must be yesterday's jjigae.

18:19.306 --> 18:21.850
Praetorian! Good afternoon.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.144
Huh? Is the meeting already over?

18:24.228 --> 18:25.562
No, not at all.

18:25.646 --> 18:30.442
They all left to handle some
serious trouble in Pittsburgh right now.

18:31.151 --> 18:32.069
Pittsburgh?

18:33.737 --> 18:36.156
The Necromancer and zombies?

18:36.240 --> 18:38.367
You're going too, right?

18:38.450 --> 18:40.869
What power do you have right now?

18:41.537 --> 18:42.663
Now?

18:48.168 --> 18:51.630
Now, I can hear people
even though I can't see them.

18:52.631 --> 18:56.802
Really? Sharp ears! That's amazing!

19:00.180 --> 19:01.682
Let's hightail it

19:01.765 --> 19:04.643
before The Utopian and the others
realize they're fake zombies.

19:05.227 --> 19:08.147
Yes. It's a very useful power.

19:09.356 --> 19:12.151
What? Where are you going?

19:14.862 --> 19:16.405
To the scene of the crime.

19:24.246 --> 19:25.330
Am I hallucinating?

19:29.585 --> 19:31.962
Don't think you can hide from me!

19:37.259 --> 19:39.011
-Shit!
-What?

19:39.720 --> 19:40.929
You're kidding me.

19:41.513 --> 19:42.723
Unbelievable.

19:43.307 --> 19:44.474
It wasn't my fault!

19:45.142 --> 19:46.852
You morons.

19:46.935 --> 19:49.688
Why would we display the real thing here?

19:49.771 --> 19:50.772
What?

19:51.440 --> 19:54.193
It's just like
the National Museum of Natural History.

19:54.276 --> 19:56.778
All these things are replicas.

19:56.862 --> 20:00.741
The real ones are stored in
an enormous secure underground vault.

20:01.992 --> 20:02.993
It's a fake?

20:03.076 --> 20:04.244
That was a close call.

20:04.328 --> 20:05.537
Oh, it was just a prank.

20:05.621 --> 20:08.207
Don't scare us like that.

20:08.290 --> 20:10.834
The real one's in the basement! Ghost!

20:10.918 --> 20:12.544
I'll get it this time!

20:13.503 --> 20:15.172
We're almost out of time!

20:17.132 --> 20:18.425
What kind of trick is this?

20:24.306 --> 20:25.474
No!

20:27.392 --> 20:32.439
It feels like someone's inside my head,
like in San Francisco.

20:33.398 --> 20:34.233
There she is!

20:36.526 --> 20:37.736
Kasey!

20:44.868 --> 20:46.787
I've met you somewhere before.

20:50.707 --> 20:52.793
You've got the wrong guy…

20:54.753 --> 20:55.879
It's not working.

22:17.252 --> 22:22.257
