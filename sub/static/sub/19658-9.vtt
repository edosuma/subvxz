<i>Listen up, people.</i>

00:02.825 --> 00:04.850
<i>The Believers' ship still
has the machine they used</i>

00:04.890 --> 00:08.189
<i>to steal Cosmo's powers, and
we're gonna steal 'em back.</i>

00:08.230 --> 00:10.850
<i>Quill, why don't we just use
the Continuum Cortex to teleport in?</i>

00:10.890 --> 00:14.120
Duh! It's a crashed spaceship, Gamora.

00:14.160 --> 00:15.720
We might teleport right
into a radiation leak,

00:15.760 --> 00:18.660
- or worse.
- Mm, not tail! Not the tail!

00:18.690 --> 00:20.990
Get away, you little mutt!

00:22.590 --> 00:24.940
I am Groot.

00:24.980 --> 00:27.530
I am Groot.

00:31.170 --> 00:33.390
Eh, he's got a way with animals.

00:38.810 --> 00:42.250
It's just me. Get over it already.

00:42.280 --> 00:44.560
Without his psychic energy,
he is merely a simple beast.

00:44.600 --> 00:47.380
Mm. No way, Drax.

00:47.410 --> 00:49.750
He's just frustrated 'cause
he can't read minds no more.

00:50.080 --> 00:53.540
I am Groot.

00:56.330 --> 01:00.294
- I am Groot?
- I don't hear no rumbling,

01:00.329 --> 01:02.580
and I sure don't hear
no ominous rumbling.

01:02.610 --> 01:05.260
<i> I believe.</i>

01:05.300 --> 01:08.201
<i>Oh.
That ominous rumbling.</i>

01:12.410 --> 01:15.020
No! No, no, no, no, no!
This is not the time to blink!

01:18.260 --> 01:21.150
Get ready for one big headache!

the Milano to the Believer ship.</i>

01:41.650 --> 01:44.724
<i> I believe.</i>

01:45.800 --> 01:48.460
- That can't be good.
- All the more reason

01:48.500 --> 01:51.194
to get aboard the Believer ship
and find out what they're up to.

02:00.390 --> 02:05.249
Hey. Excuse me. Could you, uh,
you know, open the eyelid for us?

02:09.789 --> 02:11.730
Cosmo, get a grip!

02:11.760 --> 02:13.210
Seriously, dude, we
need to get outta here.

02:13.250 --> 02:16.870
Do I gotta do everything myself?

02:16.900 --> 02:19.680
<i>Hey, buddy, we need to...</i>

02:21.100 --> 02:23.600
Rocket! You all right?

02:23.630 --> 02:26.410
Yeah, no thanks to
that flarknard in there.

02:26.440 --> 02:28.190
What's your malfunction?!

02:28.220 --> 02:30.450
Hold that thought.

02:30.480 --> 02:35.240
Cosmo, what is it, boy?

02:35.280 --> 02:37.960
Why do you question that animal
when you know he cannot answer?

02:38.000 --> 02:40.630
'Cause he's smarter than
the rest of ya put together.

02:40.670 --> 02:41.908
Now let's go, you krutackers.

02:41.909 --> 02:44.844
Cosmo's gonna lead the way.

02:53.940 --> 02:57.610
I believe.

02:57.650 --> 03:00.670
Uh, where exactly
is Cosmo leading us?

03:00.700 --> 03:02.989
How should I know?
I'm just glad it's not you.

03:06.220 --> 03:08.698
Good dog, Cosmo. What'd you find?

03:09.610 --> 03:12.460
<i>I believe. I believe.</i>

03:12.700 --> 03:14.570
<i>I believe. I believe.</i>

03:14.700 --> 03:16.610
<i>I believe. I believe.</i>

03:16.640 --> 03:20.470
- Zombies!
- Uh, what's a zombie?

03:20.471 --> 03:22.522
Clearly, it is an enemy.

03:22.557 --> 03:24.030
<i>I believe. I believe.</i>

03:24.260 --> 03:26.320
<i>I believe. I believe.</i>

03:26.450 --> 03:27.960
<i>I believe. I believe.</i>

03:28.000 --> 03:30.110
An extremely slow enemy.

03:30.150 --> 03:33.340
Ha! That's what everybody says

03:33.380 --> 03:36.368
right before the
zombies eat their brains.

03:37.510 --> 03:40.890
Wait for it. Wait for it.

03:40.930 --> 03:45.605
<i>I believe. I believe.
I believe...</i>

03:47.950 --> 03:50.830
I am Groot?

03:50.870 --> 03:54.540
My brain's still intact, which is
more than I can say for Quill's.

03:54.570 --> 03:57.630
I know this man. He once
made me an excellent sandwich.

03:57.660 --> 04:00.400
Of course! They're
all upstanding citizens

04:00.440 --> 04:02.870
until they go all zombie.

04:02.910 --> 04:06.865
<i>I believe. I believe...</i>

04:07.390 --> 04:12.260
- Hey, that's my ship you're tearing up!
- Rocket, wait. If Quill's right,

04:12.340 --> 04:14.420
which may be a first,
these are innocent people.

04:14.460 --> 04:16.420
They are not in control
of their actions.

04:16.450 --> 04:20.927
What? I had it on "stun"...
possibly-ish.

04:23.087 --> 04:26.380
Aha! See? Superstrong.
That's a zombie thing.

04:26.410 --> 04:28.610
I have studied every
zombie movie ever made.

04:28.650 --> 04:31.730
Wait.
You know them from movies?

04:31.770 --> 04:34.710
Well, mostly that one music video,
but I saw it, like, a billion times.

04:34.750 --> 04:37.240
Hang on. Okay. Look. I've
got it all right here on tape.

04:37.270 --> 04:41.177
"Star-Lord's Audio Guide to
Surviving a Zombie Attack."

04:41.217 --> 04:44.242
Why would you record an audio guide
to surviving a fictional situation?

04:44.243 --> 04:46.260
Uh, I'd just beening a taken by aliens.

04:46.300 --> 04:47.540
Everything was kind of up for grabs.

04:47.580 --> 04:50.790
<i> I believe.</i>

05:00.400 --> 05:02.461
Quill, are you okay?

05:04.990 --> 05:08.970
That krutacker scratched my tape player!

05:09.010 --> 05:11.260
You know how hard it is to
find parts for this thing?

05:11.300 --> 05:13.550
<i>Not as hard as it'll be
to replace all your ship's parts</i>

05:13.590 --> 05:15.900
<i>if we let those krutackers
make off with 'em!</i>

05:15.940 --> 05:18.090
<i>I believe.</i>

05:18.120 --> 05:21.770
- I am Groot.
- Now can I blast 'em?

05:21.800 --> 05:24.140
Try not to do any permanent damage.

05:24.180 --> 05:27.440
You just gotta suck
the joy out of everything.

05:47.320 --> 05:49.749
I believe.

05:49.784 --> 05:51.411
 I am Groot!

05:51.446 --> 05:54.040
<i>I believe.</i>

05:54.080 --> 05:56.370
<i>I believe. I believe...</i>

05:56.400 --> 06:00.080
Stun beams ain't working on these
guys. They just keep coming back.

06:00.120 --> 06:02.150
That's 'cause zombies don't stay down,

06:02.180 --> 06:03.750
which you'd know if
you listened to my tape.

06:03.790 --> 06:08.410
- We have to fall back.
- Cosmo, we're leaving.

06:08.450 --> 06:10.510
<i> I believe.</i>

06:10.540 --> 06:15.000
- We have to get to the...
- Quill, are you all right?

06:18.120 --> 06:20.070
Quill?

06:20.100 --> 06:22.570
I believe.

06:22.610 --> 06:26.770
- Quill's a zombie!
- I am Groot?

06:26.810 --> 06:28.790
How should I know how he turned zombie?

06:28.830 --> 06:31.234
Right now, we gotta keep
'em all away from us!

06:37.580 --> 06:39.120
Good idea, Cosmo!

06:39.150 --> 06:41.680
Shortcut through the
Knowhere marketplace.

06:41.720 --> 06:44.860
<i>- I believe.
- I am Groot.</i>

06:44.890 --> 06:49.210
<i>The zombie-filled
Knowhere marketplace.</i>

06:55.140 --> 06:58.380
<i>I believe.</i>

06:58.420 --> 07:02.030
<i>I believe. I believe.</i>

07:02.060 --> 07:05.150
<i>I believe. I believe...</i>

07:05.180 --> 07:09.180
That krutackin' Believer ship is
putting the hoodoo on everybody!

07:09.220 --> 07:11.490
There's no choice now. We have
to use the Continuum Cortex

07:11.520 --> 07:15.080
- to get onto that ship.
- Can I point out that there's

07:15.120 --> 07:18.040
a bazillion zombies
between us and the Cortex?

07:18.080 --> 07:20.970
The ones in the hangar
ignored us until we interfered.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.790
Maybe if we blend in,
we can sneak through.

07:22.820 --> 07:27.250
I will consult Quill's zombie survival
guide. He may have valuable advice.

07:27.290 --> 07:29.600
When has Quill ever had valuable advice?

07:29.640 --> 07:33.310
Just be quiet and act like a zombie.
I believe.

07:33.340 --> 07:35.290
I believe.

07:35.330 --> 07:39.480
- I believe.

<i>Rule one: If someone tells
you, "I'm not like other guys,"</i>

07:46.337 --> 07:47.880
<i>take their word for it.</i>

07:47.920 --> 07:50.627
You there.
Are you like other guys?

07:50.662 --> 07:54.340

<i>Rule two: Avoid abandoned
houses with window blinds</i>

08:03.280 --> 08:04.910
<i>that cast spooky,
prison-bar-looking shadows.</i>

08:07.450 --> 08:09.510
Drax will destroy all
foul window blinds!

<i>I believe. I believe.</i>

08:27.190 --> 08:30.960
<i>Rule three: Head shots.
Always head shots.</i>

08:30.990 --> 08:34.740
Rule three: Head shots.
Always... Huh?

08:34.780 --> 08:37.230
We're not doing that.
Just keep moving.

08:42.570 --> 08:45.170
<i>I believe. I believe.</i>

08:49.380 --> 08:51.930
That dumb animal knows
nothing about sneaking.

08:51.960 --> 08:54.410
Then you two have something in common.

08:54.450 --> 08:57.840

09:54.180 --> 09:56.711
Continuum Cortex! Go!

10:03.830 --> 10:07.524
Controls are dead.
That energy pulse must've knocked

10:07.530 --> 10:10.926
- out the Continuum Cortex too.
- You better get it working,

10:10.961 --> 10:13.680
'cause the zombies are coming,
and it's our only way out.

10:13.720 --> 10:16.550
<i> I will protect
Quill's zombie-fighting guide.</i>

10:16.590 --> 10:18.640
Where ya gonna hide it?
Never mind. Don't wanna know.

10:18.670 --> 10:20.710
<i>I believe.</i>

10:24.150 --> 10:26.850
Are you all right?

10:26.880 --> 10:29.220
I'm... fine.

10:29.260 --> 10:31.840
But that door's not gonna hold for long.

10:31.870 --> 10:36.270
It's your toy, Cosmo. How do
I reboot this thing?

10:36.310 --> 10:39.453
You know, you're really not
helping your case here, mutt.

10:40.320 --> 10:43.500
<i>I believe. I believe...</i>

10:46.180 --> 10:49.017
<i>I believe. I believe...</i>

10:52.840 --> 10:54.680
Guys! Let go!

10:58.210 --> 11:01.580
Wait. I've seen this before.

11:01.620 --> 11:05.670
Yeah. When Quill flew the big
head around and blasted Thanos.

11:05.700 --> 11:08.130
The zombies are going to pilot Knowhere?

11:08.160 --> 11:10.530
- To what location?
- Can't be anywhere good.

11:10.570 --> 11:12.380
Then we need to stop
them from taking control.

11:22.910 --> 11:24.120
Come on. Fight it.

11:30.130 --> 11:31.360
Gamora!

11:37.750 --> 11:40.930
<i>I believe.</i>

11:40.960 --> 11:43.130
Aw, krutack!

11:43.170 --> 11:45.000
<i>I believe.</i>

11:48.320 --> 11:50.730
Gamora, I will avenge you!

11:50.770 --> 11:53.970
Forget it, Drax. We
don't need vengeance.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.690
We need to find out what the
flarg is going on around here.

11:55.720 --> 11:58.660
Come on.
Cosmo's got a plan.

11:58.690 --> 12:00.890
<i>I believe.</i>

12:04.560 --> 12:06.680
I see no point in following this animal.

12:06.720 --> 12:08.820
Look, I'm telling ya,
he's got something.

12:08.850 --> 12:10.770
Maybe it's an override for the Cortex,

12:10.800 --> 12:15.026
or some kind of de-zombifier.

12:16.560 --> 12:19.470
Oh, you're killin' me here, pooch.

12:21.460 --> 12:23.399
Gimme that!

12:29.090 --> 12:34.270
- Ha! In your face, Drax!
- What? What is in my face?

12:34.310 --> 12:36.550
Check this out.
Security monitors.

12:36.590 --> 12:38.550
We got eyes all over Knowhere.

12:41.050 --> 12:43.710
The zombies aren't
just tearing stuff up.

12:43.740 --> 12:47.560
They're building some kind of weapon.
A Believer weapon.

12:51.940 --> 12:54.440
And they're taking it to Xandar!

12:54.470 --> 12:56.850
But what would Xandar have that
would interest the Believers?

12:56.890 --> 13:00.010
Oh, nothin' much. Just
the krutackin' Cocoon

13:00.040 --> 13:03.040
that they think is
gonna save the galaxy.

13:03.070 --> 13:05.790
If only I could
get to that Believer ship,

13:05.820 --> 13:07.480
I would yank it out with my bare hands!

13:11.650 --> 13:14.220
Service tunnels! Perfect!
We just gotta figure out

13:14.221 --> 13:17.455
how to move that krutackin'
ship once we get there.

13:18.820 --> 13:23.278
Oh-ho-ho-ho!
You are one brilliant pooch.

13:23.313 --> 13:25.083
Yes, you are!

13:32.420 --> 13:35.400
This is not the Believer ship.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.380
That animal merely pushed
random buttons. He has no plan!

13:38.420 --> 13:40.670
Wanna bet?

13:40.710 --> 13:42.030
Cosmo brought us here
'cause he wants us to fly

13:42.070 --> 13:45.360
a bunch of these mining
pods up to the Believer ship

13:45.400 --> 13:47.830
and use 'em to push that
krutacker outta Knowhere's skull.

13:47.870 --> 13:49.790
Ain't that right, pooch?

13:55.270 --> 13:57.530
<i> I believe.</i>

14:01.400 --> 14:05.550
He has led us straight into a trap.
Forgive me, Gamora.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.730
<i>I believe.</i>

14:13.150 --> 14:16.640
I am Groot!

14:16.680 --> 14:19.490
I finally get to shoot Quill, and
I don't even have time to enjoy it.

14:23.910 --> 14:25.740
Aw, krutack!

14:25.770 --> 14:28.031
<i>I believe.</i>

14:35.560 --> 14:37.480
Again, my apologies.

14:37.520 --> 14:39.945
<i>I believe.</i>

14:40.850 --> 14:43.680
<i>I believe.</i>

14:48.550 --> 14:49.980
Get to the pods.

15:09.480 --> 15:12.060
There's the Believer ship.

15:12.090 --> 15:14.129
Find yourself a good place to push.

15:23.170 --> 15:27.242
Okay, let's shove this
krutackin' thing outta here!

15:37.900 --> 15:40.321
Success. The ship is moving.

15:42.180 --> 15:43.670
There's a weird energy
signature coming from the ship.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.410
Hang on.

15:47.200 --> 15:52.860
<i> I believe.
I believe.</i>

15:52.900 --> 15:56.170
<i> I believe.</i>

16:01.670 --> 16:04.240
Come on, come
on, come on! Full throttle!

16:04.280 --> 16:07.300
- Engines at maximum!
- I am Groot!

16:07.330 --> 16:09.907
We need more than maximum!

16:12.130 --> 16:14.460
Rocket, what is happening?

16:14.500 --> 16:17.140
The Believers turned on
their engines.

16:17.170 --> 16:20.784
If we don't do something,
they're gonna crush us into pulp!

16:25.248 --> 16:28.070
<i> Rocket, our pods lack
the power to overcome the Believer ship. </i>

16:28.110 --> 16:30.530
I know, I know!

16:30.560 --> 16:32.642
We gotta knock out their
engines or something before...

16:33.590 --> 16:37.962
Huh?
We're at Xandar already?

16:38.320 --> 16:40.467
Who knew a severed head
could move that fast?

16:44.870 --> 16:48.360
I will play Quill's zombie survival
tape. Perhaps he will have an idea.

16:48.400 --> 16:53.361
I do not want the last words I hear
to be Quill's krutackin' nonsense!

16:58.560 --> 17:04.064
Oh, that is it! We are now
officially 100% krutacked!

17:07.569 --> 17:09.720
And there's a power surge
in the Continuum Cortex.

17:09.750 --> 17:12.023
Oh, this ain't good!

17:12.920 --> 17:15.500
The Believers have the Cocoon,

17:15.530 --> 17:18.020
so they can open it and maybe
destroy the entire universe.

17:18.060 --> 17:21.099
But that don't matter to us, see,
'cause we're gonna get squished

17:21.140 --> 17:24.204
flatter than a firpnik
in the next 15 seconds!

17:25.099 --> 17:29.880
- I am Groot!
- Then I must act quickly.

17:29.910 --> 17:35.290
<i>Rule three: Head shots.
Always head shots.</i>

17:35.330 --> 17:37.690
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Head shots.

17:37.730 --> 17:40.080
Quill's actually right for once.

17:40.120 --> 17:42.530
A head shot is exactly what we need!

17:42.570 --> 17:46.030
<i>Ha! This time, the humiliation
is in your face, Rocket!</i>

17:46.060 --> 17:48.070
<i>I am Groot.</i>

17:48.110 --> 17:50.180
I need full remote control of your pods.

17:50.220 --> 17:52.010
You've gotta trust me on this one.

17:52.040 --> 17:56.348
Okay. Here we...

17:56.850 --> 17:58.370
<i>Here we what?
What are you doing?</i>

17:58.410 --> 18:00.400
Cosmo, no! Stay!

18:00.430 --> 18:03.090
 Heel!

18:07.780 --> 18:11.040
Bad dog! Bad zombie dog!

18:20.760 --> 18:23.360
Okay, this time for sure.

18:23.400 --> 18:26.190
One head shot, coming right up!

18:26.230 --> 18:29.980
That Believer ship wants
to push through this skull?

18:30.020 --> 18:32.564
Let it push all the
way through this skull!

18:44.190 --> 18:46.530
Yeah!

18:46.560 --> 18:48.030
<i> I believe.</i>

18:51.380 --> 18:53.040
Where are we?

18:53.080 --> 18:56.550
And, uh, where are my tunes?

18:56.580 --> 19:00.430
Gentlemen, we have
saved the universe again!

19:00.460 --> 19:02.390
<i>- Drax the Destroyer triumphs!
- I am Groot!</i>

19:09.650 --> 19:11.450
 Hey, Cosmo!

19:11.480 --> 19:13.690
Ya had me worried
there for a sec, pooch.

19:13.730 --> 19:17.290
<i>Greetings, Believer
brothers and sisters.</i>

19:17.300 --> 19:22.010
<i>Rejoice! For the new
Golden Age is at hand!</i>

19:22.040 --> 19:26.560
<i>Once the cannon is fully charged
with our own Belief energy,</i>

19:26.600 --> 19:30.690
<i>it will fire its beam,
opening the Cocoon,</i>

19:30.730 --> 19:34.740
<i>and I believe the
Golden Age will begin!</i>

19:34.770 --> 19:38.130
<i>I believe. I believe.</i>

19:38.170 --> 19:40.740
- Our celebration was premature.
- I believe...

19:40.780 --> 19:43.660
We must get to the Cortex and
stop them from opening the Cocoon.

19:43.700 --> 19:47.590
We'll never make it in time!

19:49.080 --> 19:51.850
- Unless some genius mutt
- I believe...

19:51.890 --> 19:55.152
has a Continuum Cortex
passport for a collar!

19:59.820 --> 20:02.820
Yes!
The cannon's still charging!

20:02.860 --> 20:05.311
I just gotta shut it down
without blowing us sky high.

20:06.988 --> 20:09.233
Cosmo!

20:13.990 --> 20:15.420
Cosmo!

20:20.780 --> 20:23.010
 Drax thought
you was a dumb animal,

20:23.040 --> 20:25.190
but he was wrong.

20:25.230 --> 20:28.060
Don't you worry.
I'll tell him.

20:28.090 --> 20:30.741
I'll tell everybody he was a hero.

20:33.210 --> 20:35.680
Listen up, losers!

20:35.720 --> 20:38.390
Cosmo sacrificed himself
to save the universe.

20:38.430 --> 20:41.820
- I hope you appreciate...
- Comrade Rocket! Is okay!

20:41.850 --> 20:43.980
<i>Cosmo is not sacrifice.</i>

20:44.020 --> 20:48.650
Cosmo!
Buddy, you're alive!

20:48.690 --> 20:52.790
And you're readin' my krutackin'
mind, ya meddlin' pooch!

20:52.820 --> 20:57.380
<i>This true. Thanks to blast of
energy, Cosmo is Cosmo again.</i>

20:57.410 --> 21:01.066
<i>Uh...</i>

21:01.101 --> 21:03.253
<i>Eh...</i>

21:03.288 --> 21:05.880
<i>Well, maybe Cosmo
is too much Cosmo.</i>

21:05.910 --> 21:07.500
Huh?

21:09.420 --> 21:11.770
<i>Sorry, Comrade Rocket.</i>

21:11.800 --> 21:15.230
<i>Cosmo is not able to
control this much power.</i>

21:15.260 --> 21:21.930
<i>Unfortunately, Cosmo is not able
to keep Cocoon from opening, either.</i>

21:21.960 --> 21:24.670
<i>Please to brace yourself
for Golden Age,</i>

21:24.710 --> 21:28.033
<i>or destruction of universe!</i>

21:29.193 --> 21:32.214
