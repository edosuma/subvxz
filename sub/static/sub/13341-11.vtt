WEBVTT

01:02.000 --> 01:05.834
( moaning )

01:17.834 --> 01:19.834
Mm.

01:19.834 --> 01:21.166
Mm.

01:26.792 --> 01:29.041
( snaps )

01:33.166 --> 01:34.834
Hannah:
Wait, so you're just
gonna leave?

01:34.834 --> 01:37.041
Come on, kid.
We talked about this.

01:38.500 --> 01:39.750
We didn't really
talk about it.

01:39.750 --> 01:41.625
You know what?
You talked about it
and I listened.

01:41.625 --> 01:44.375
There's nothing I'd rather do
than stay here, fall asleep,

01:44.375 --> 01:47.000
wake up, watch you snoring,
and fuck you again,

01:47.000 --> 01:48.125
but if I don't
go back to Ray's,

01:48.125 --> 01:49.834
I'm not gonna do
my vocal exercises,

01:49.834 --> 01:51.417
and I'm gonna be late for tech,
and I'd rather do this now

01:51.417 --> 01:53.667
- so I don't have to
worry about it later.
- I know...

01:53.667 --> 01:55.625
and I'm so proud of you
for how hard you're working,

01:55.625 --> 01:58.792
so just do your thing
and I will be here.

01:58.792 --> 02:00.375
- Okay.
- Okay.

02:00.375 --> 02:02.125
It's not always
gonna be like this.

02:02.125 --> 02:04.041
I know. Okay.

02:05.208 --> 02:06.625
Mm.

02:09.875 --> 02:12.500
But is there a part of you
that thinks it will  always
be like this?

02:12.500 --> 02:13.834
Come on, kid, this
is the exact kind of thing

02:13.834 --> 02:16.542
that takes my head
out of where it needs
to be right now.

02:16.542 --> 02:19.417
I know, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

02:19.417 --> 02:21.542
I'm trying to--

02:21.542 --> 02:25.333
I'm gonna be
very good.

02:26.208 --> 02:28.708
( sighs )
Okay.

02:28.708 --> 02:30.000
Okay.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.375
( groans )

02:31.375 --> 02:33.500
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

02:33.500 --> 02:35.166
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

02:35.166 --> 02:37.458
Bye.

02:42.041 --> 02:45.250
( music playing )

02:56.250 --> 03:00.417
( British accent )
"Oh, we're companions
in misfortune, Rummy.

03:00.417 --> 03:02.417
Both of us got names
nobody can't pronounce.

03:02.417 --> 03:04.792
Consequently,
I'm "Snobby" and you're "Rummy"

03:04.792 --> 03:08.083
because 'Bill' and 'Sally'
wasn't good enough
for our parents.

03:08.083 --> 03:09.959
Such is life."

03:11.417 --> 03:15.583
"Who saved you, Mr. Price?
Was it Major Barbara?"

03:15.583 --> 03:17.708
"No, I come here on me own.

03:17.708 --> 03:21.417
I'm gonna be
'Bronterre O'Brien Price,'
the converted--"

03:21.417 --> 03:23.542
- ( knock on door )
- Oh, hello.

03:23.542 --> 03:25.458
That's my fuckin' neighbor.
We're being too loud.

03:25.458 --> 03:27.583
Is it Major Barbara?

03:30.291 --> 03:31.959
Hey.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.166
( normal voice )
Hey.

03:39.125 --> 03:42.041
I couldn't sleep
so I took a walk and I
just ended up in the area

03:42.041 --> 03:45.333
so I thought I'd drop in
and see you brothers.

03:45.333 --> 03:48.417
Oh, my God,
Ray, this place
looks so amazing.

03:48.417 --> 03:52.291
Thanks, yeah,
I'm trying to make it
more, uh, clean.

03:52.291 --> 03:56.291
Ray, could you give us
a second, please?

03:56.291 --> 03:59.875
Yeah, sure.
I was about to head off
to bed anyway,

03:59.875 --> 04:02.125
so I'm gonna do that.

04:02.125 --> 04:04.125
Good night, Hannah,
good night, Adam.

04:04.125 --> 04:06.625
Please be expressive
but also...

04:06.625 --> 04:08.583
( whispers )
keep it down.

04:08.583 --> 04:10.834
Sleep well.

04:12.708 --> 04:14.750
Fancy seeing you here.

04:14.750 --> 04:16.333
What's going on?

04:16.333 --> 04:20.125
I had a terrible intuition
that just dragged me out of bed

04:20.125 --> 04:21.500
'cause I was thinking
about you here,

04:21.500 --> 04:22.667
and I thought about
how you like to have

04:22.667 --> 04:24.375
one-and-a-half bananas
in the morning

04:24.375 --> 04:26.875
and I didn't know if Ray
even had any bananas.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.708
So, where
are the bananas?

04:30.708 --> 04:34.000
I'm sorry,
this is stupid.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.500
You have got to
relax.

04:36.500 --> 04:38.917
I'm trying to relax,
but it's very hard to relax

04:38.917 --> 04:41.708
when I feel like
you're leaving me
only in such slow motion

04:41.708 --> 04:43.250
I'm not even gonna notice
till it's done.

04:43.250 --> 04:46.250
I'm not
going anywhere.

04:46.250 --> 04:48.417
Look, I think it is very
important for our relationship

04:48.417 --> 04:52.208
that we are
in the same place
tonight, okay?

04:52.208 --> 04:53.792
We cannot spend
the night separately.

04:53.792 --> 04:55.959
I will sit
on the couch, okay?

04:55.959 --> 04:57.834
I will play on my iPhone
on silent.

04:57.834 --> 04:59.750
You know
I can't concentrate
while you're here.

04:59.750 --> 05:01.083
That's why I'm here.

05:01.083 --> 05:02.291
I see you and I think
"play time,"

05:02.291 --> 05:04.875
and I need to be thinking
"work time."

05:04.875 --> 05:08.458
Okay, no, I know.
I'm sorry.

05:10.500 --> 05:14.000
No, no, no,
no, no, stop.
Hannah, stop.

05:16.667 --> 05:19.750
( siren blaring )

05:24.375 --> 05:26.917
Everything's
gonna be fine.

05:26.917 --> 05:28.208
Okay.

05:28.208 --> 05:29.625
I know it's hard,

05:29.625 --> 05:32.000
but someday
you're gonna have something
fucking major going on

05:32.000 --> 05:34.708
and you're gonna understand
why I needed this time
for myself right now.

05:34.708 --> 05:37.708
Okay?

05:40.000 --> 05:42.708
( keys jingle, lock clicks )

05:49.208 --> 05:51.250
Yeah, as long as
all the stuff is level,

05:51.250 --> 05:53.041
then I think
we're good.

05:53.041 --> 05:54.625
- We're good, right, Trev?
- Trevor: Yep.

05:54.625 --> 05:56.291
- Beedie: Let me
ask you something.
- Mm-hmm.

05:56.291 --> 05:58.417
What do you think
of the font?

05:58.417 --> 06:02.041
I think it's strong
but not too aggressive.

06:02.041 --> 06:04.417
Perfect for what
you're trying to say.

06:04.417 --> 06:05.834
- Hmm, yeah?
- Yeah.

06:05.834 --> 06:07.583
I hate it.

06:07.583 --> 06:09.500
Yeah, the wall font
is weird as fuck.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.417
Let me get in touch
with our graphic designer.

06:11.417 --> 06:12.875
He needs
to handle this ASAP.

06:12.875 --> 06:14.750
Marnie, can you try
to get ahold of him?

06:14.750 --> 06:17.542
- I have to get to therapy.
- Yeah, of course.

06:17.542 --> 06:20.000
- Um, I just--
- Bye, Beedie.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.583
- Bye-bye, sweetie.
- Marnie: Bye, Sooj.

06:24.500 --> 06:26.458
Beedie:
Hello?

06:26.458 --> 06:28.917
Hello, miss?

06:28.917 --> 06:30.291
Oh, yes?

06:30.291 --> 06:32.083
I was just wondering
if you could roll me over

06:32.083 --> 06:35.208
- to the photo
of the bald guy.
- Yes, of course.

06:35.208 --> 06:39.500
- I'm so sorry about that.
- No, no, it's fine.

06:43.792 --> 06:45.542
How's this?
Can you see him?

06:45.542 --> 06:46.458
Yeah.

06:46.458 --> 06:48.542
I hope it's not tacky
for me to say

06:48.542 --> 06:51.458
that I studied your work
when I was in school.

06:51.458 --> 06:53.917
- Really? Where did you go?
- I went to Oberlin.

06:53.917 --> 06:57.458
Well, that figures
'cause my ex-husband
taught there.

06:57.458 --> 06:58.917
Really?

06:58.917 --> 07:03.125
And he's still guilty
so he keeps working me
into the curriculum.

07:03.125 --> 07:05.041
I mean, I really
love your photos.

07:05.041 --> 07:08.166
I don't understand
how the people don't see
that you're taking them.

07:08.166 --> 07:09.959
It was harder
when I was young,

07:09.959 --> 07:11.917
but, you know,
now I'm old,

07:11.917 --> 07:14.583
and no one ever
looks at me anyway.

07:14.583 --> 07:16.667
I'm sure
that's not true, Beedie.

07:16.667 --> 07:18.333
No, it is true.

07:18.333 --> 07:21.208
Getting old,
it's the pits.

07:22.583 --> 07:25.166
Like, I hate
watching television

07:25.166 --> 07:28.375
because all the old women
are shells...

07:29.375 --> 07:33.959
and it-- it just hurts
to be a shell.

07:33.959 --> 07:37.166
Hannah:
Are you gonna come
to Marnie's open mic thing?

07:37.166 --> 07:39.583
Um, no.

07:39.583 --> 07:42.041
Why not?
I really don't want
to go without you.

07:42.041 --> 07:44.542
She sucks
and she needs to stop.

07:44.542 --> 07:45.875
She doesn't suck.

07:45.875 --> 07:49.458
( sighs )
All right, yes, technically,
she does not suck.

07:49.458 --> 07:52.250
- She has a very
gifted instrument.
- Mm-hmm.

07:52.250 --> 07:56.667
But her performance style
is both too stiff
and too hopeful.

07:56.667 --> 07:58.542
She's like...

08:00.125 --> 08:02.166
- "Papa?"
- ( Hannah laughs )

08:02.166 --> 08:03.959
"Am I a pretty girl,
Mama?"

08:03.959 --> 08:06.542
That's so good.
That's so true.

08:06.542 --> 08:08.542
- That was so good.
- Really good.

08:08.542 --> 08:10.208
Why can't you just
come sit down with me?

08:10.208 --> 08:13.208
Because I have to go fix
my fucking Patti LuPone
interview.

08:13.208 --> 08:16.041
- Why?
- Because the last time
I went to interview her,

08:16.041 --> 08:17.834
all we did was
talk about, like,
her life in the theater

08:17.834 --> 08:19.000
and why you
shouldn't fuck actors

08:19.000 --> 08:21.583
and I didn't get
one useful quote
about bone density.

08:21.583 --> 08:23.500
- I want to come.
- You can't come.

08:23.500 --> 08:25.417
I mean, she is amazing.
She's a fountain of wisdom.

08:25.417 --> 08:27.625
But you can't come.
It's a professional
engagement.

08:27.625 --> 08:29.083
Please, you didn't even know
who Patti LuPone was

08:29.083 --> 08:30.542
before I
explained it to you.

08:30.542 --> 08:32.125
That's so not true.

08:32.125 --> 08:33.250
Please let me come.

08:33.250 --> 08:35.792
I want to meet
fucking "Corky's mom."

08:37.291 --> 08:38.291
Fine.

08:38.291 --> 08:40.000
- Really?
- Yeah, really...

08:40.000 --> 08:41.875
but there's
a number of things
you can't do.

08:41.875 --> 08:43.166
Okay, anything,
anything, anything.

08:43.166 --> 08:44.750
- Talk.
- What?

08:44.750 --> 08:45.625
Don't touch her things.

08:45.625 --> 08:47.834
Can I just touch,
like, one Tony?

08:47.834 --> 08:52.083
- No, especially
not her Tonys.
- One?

08:52.083 --> 08:55.125
And not her husband,
if his name is Tony.

08:55.125 --> 08:57.750
I'm gonna touch
that Tony.

08:57.750 --> 08:59.667

09:15.291 --> 09:18.250
If I can be so bold,
we sound fucking amazing.

09:18.250 --> 09:21.458
I know, it's the first thing
I've ever written that actually
feels like me

09:21.458 --> 09:23.375
or like we--
that we wrote together.

09:23.375 --> 09:25.250
It is incredible
that we met each other.

09:25.250 --> 09:26.959
I mean, we just wrote
that fucking song.

09:26.959 --> 09:29.708
I cannot remember
the last time I wrote
a whole song.

09:29.708 --> 09:32.625
Yeah, well, it's still
missing its bridge, but--

09:32.625 --> 09:34.041
Tomorrow night's
gonna be the tits.

09:34.041 --> 09:38.417
It's gonna be you and me

I know,
I'm so excited.

09:40.959 --> 09:43.000
I can't wait.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.583
I saw that
YouTube video

09:45.583 --> 09:47.917
that you made of that
Edie Brickell song.

09:47.917 --> 09:51.834
Oh, my gosh.
That was, like, not me.

09:51.834 --> 09:55.583
- There was
this girl who looks--
- It was a bummer.

09:55.583 --> 09:58.041
Ooh, it really made me
just really uncomfortable.

09:58.041 --> 10:01.583
Yeah, that's
the general reaction
people have to it.

10:01.583 --> 10:03.000
So tomorrow night,
all right?

10:03.000 --> 10:05.625
Let's just keep it loose,
all right?

10:05.625 --> 10:09.208
- Just relax-- natural.
- Yeah.

10:09.208 --> 10:10.875
I'm all about
relaxed and natural.

10:10.875 --> 10:13.000
It's just you and me
up there.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.333

super natural.

10:28.875 --> 10:31.083
I had three classes,
a Physique 57,

10:31.083 --> 10:34.875
and I got in a fight
with Zeva about her post-grad
trip to Lisbon.

10:34.875 --> 10:37.333
Oh, and they told us
that we all have to wear
the graduation cap,

10:37.333 --> 10:40.417
which I know
for a fact is not true
at all comparable universities,

10:40.417 --> 10:42.542

11:23.750 --> 11:25.583
Okay, seriously,
you have to behave

11:25.583 --> 11:27.667
'cause I am only gonna get
one more chance at this.

11:27.667 --> 11:30.792
I've given you,
like, 33 chances
to be in my life, okay?

11:30.792 --> 11:32.750
So cut me some slack.

11:32.750 --> 11:34.083
You look great.

11:34.083 --> 11:36.750
- ( gasps )
- Hi, Ms. LuPone.

11:36.750 --> 11:38.667
Thank you so much
for making the time.

11:38.667 --> 11:41.875
Hello, sweet face.
Mwah.

11:41.875 --> 11:43.708
Hi, this is
my friend Elijah.

11:43.708 --> 11:47.708
Oh, you didn't tell me
you were bringing
Troy Donahue.

11:47.708 --> 11:49.583
( gasps )

11:49.583 --> 11:53.750
Come on in, honey.
Hey, Peter, the girl's here.

11:53.750 --> 11:56.708
She brought one
tall drink of water.

11:56.708 --> 12:00.291
Ms. LuPone, I just want to say
what an honor it is to be
here in your home,

12:00.291 --> 12:02.834
and you are
such an inspiration
to us underdogs.

12:02.834 --> 12:05.792
- Completely.
- You, an underdog?

12:05.792 --> 12:07.750
You look like
a fucking Kennedy.

12:07.750 --> 12:09.625
- It's true,
with the bowtie.
- ( laughs )

12:09.625 --> 12:13.125
So, this is just
two to three questions
about how Strenova

12:13.125 --> 12:15.333
has positively impacted
your day-to-day life.

12:15.333 --> 12:17.959
What makes you think
I was ever an underdog?

12:17.959 --> 12:20.625
No, no, I don't think
you're an underdog.

12:20.625 --> 12:22.125
I was saying
that I'm  an underdog

12:22.125 --> 12:23.875
and that she is
definitely an underdog.

12:23.875 --> 12:25.291
So I was never
an underdog.

12:25.291 --> 12:27.458
I never auditioned
for the chorus.

12:27.458 --> 12:29.458
( scoffs )
Fuck that.

12:29.458 --> 12:30.667
And you
want to know why?

12:30.667 --> 12:34.667
- Both: Why?
- Self-esteem.
Confidence.

12:34.667 --> 12:37.667
I knew who I was.
I knew who I was.

12:37.667 --> 12:39.542
- Do you know who you are?
- Not a clue.

12:39.542 --> 12:41.542
Honestly, I just need, like,
two to three sentences

12:41.542 --> 12:44.667
on the positive impact
Strenova's had on your
day-to-day life.

12:44.667 --> 12:46.917
Oh, Hannah, please.

12:46.917 --> 12:50.583
Honey, chill out.
Relax.

12:50.583 --> 12:52.417
Yeah, relax.

12:52.417 --> 12:53.959
Relax.

12:53.959 --> 12:56.041
- Relax.
- Yeah.

12:56.041 --> 12:57.500
- Peter: Who's hungry?
- I am!

12:57.500 --> 12:58.708
Whoo, I want to eat.

12:58.708 --> 13:01.667
What'd you get-- oh,
he's a wonderful cook.
Salmon.

13:01.667 --> 13:02.875
We don't want
to interrupt your dinner.

13:02.875 --> 13:04.250
Honestly, it's just
an in-out operation.

13:04.250 --> 13:07.708
Oh, please, 30 years.
We're sick of looking
at each other.

13:09.125 --> 13:11.750
I'm not sick
of looking at her.

13:11.750 --> 13:14.291
Honey,
it was a joke.

13:14.291 --> 13:16.083
- Oh!
- When are you gonna get
my sense of humor?

13:16.083 --> 13:18.542
( laughing )

13:18.542 --> 13:23.250
I just want some space
and I'm sick of fucking
explaining it.

13:23.250 --> 13:24.750
Ray:
Yeah, I get that.

13:24.750 --> 13:29.250
- ( water splashes )
- We can't always justify
ourselves, you know?

13:29.250 --> 13:30.375
Yeah.

13:30.375 --> 13:33.000
Like, recently,
I had this thing with a girl,

13:33.000 --> 13:35.750
and by all accounts,
I should've been psyched.

13:35.750 --> 13:39.208
She was beautiful, driven,
had an amazing fucking chin,

13:39.208 --> 13:41.959
but, I don't know,
something about it
just didn't feel right.

13:41.959 --> 13:44.333
- Yeah.
- And I tried talking
to her about it,

13:44.333 --> 13:48.041
but, ultimately,
I just had to fucking drop
the guillotine, you know?

13:48.041 --> 13:49.458
Cut bait.

13:49.458 --> 13:51.041
And she was like,
"What the..."

13:51.041 --> 13:54.375
And I was like,
"You heard me, slut."

13:54.375 --> 13:56.333
I didn't really
call her a slut, though.

13:56.333 --> 13:58.417
Yeah, no, fuck, fuck.

13:58.417 --> 14:00.959
I just feel like right now
I'm just in a place

14:00.959 --> 14:02.750
where I don't
want to compromise,
you know what I mean?

14:02.750 --> 14:04.792
Like, fuck it.
If the situation's
not perfect,

14:04.792 --> 14:06.291
- I'm not gonna settle.
- Yeah.

14:06.291 --> 14:08.625
And if that means being single,
then fuck it, I'm gonna
be single.

14:08.625 --> 14:10.667
- Maybe I need
to be single.
- Yeah.

14:10.667 --> 14:13.375
That's why
I never signed a lease
until I found this place.

14:13.375 --> 14:15.583
Until I found the fucking
perfect apartment.

14:15.583 --> 14:19.542
God, I love this place.

14:19.542 --> 14:23.542
And that is the last time
she fucked with a woman
in a wig cap.

14:23.542 --> 14:25.708
( laughs )
You're so bad.

14:25.708 --> 14:27.250
- Peter: She really is.
- You're so bad.

14:27.250 --> 14:29.500
She is just
a bunch of trouble.
( growls )

14:29.500 --> 14:31.750
- Let me have one.
- Peter, are you an actor
as well?

14:31.750 --> 14:33.917
I do not date actors,

14:33.917 --> 14:37.125
and I most especially
do not marry them.

14:37.125 --> 14:39.542
I'm a professor
in the CUNY system.

14:39.542 --> 14:42.083
- Amazing.
- Awesome, do you like it?

14:43.500 --> 14:45.125
He wanted to write,

14:45.125 --> 14:47.708
so he is very far
from his passion.

14:47.708 --> 14:50.625
- I've been
very lost at times.
- Mm.

14:50.625 --> 14:53.375
Well, it's
a good thing we found
you 'cause this is fun.

14:53.375 --> 14:54.625
( laughs )

14:54.625 --> 14:56.125
When did you
stop writing?

14:56.125 --> 14:58.458
When I started
teaching.

14:58.458 --> 14:59.917
Oh, okay, so it wasn't,
like, one of those things

14:59.917 --> 15:01.667
where there was only room
for one artist in the couple

15:01.667 --> 15:03.667
and Patti's career
sort of taking off
and overshadowing yours

15:03.667 --> 15:07.708
so you decided to give up
your dreams to support her,
was it?

15:07.708 --> 15:09.291
It was.

15:09.291 --> 15:12.875
The worst thing you can do
is subjugate your passion,
truly.

15:12.875 --> 15:14.792
Peter:
But here's something
that comforts me.

15:14.792 --> 15:18.083
I may be the second wheel,
but without me,

15:18.083 --> 15:21.417
she would be
a mere unicycle.
( laughs )

15:21.417 --> 15:24.291
It's interesting,
after all this time,

15:24.291 --> 15:28.333
we still go out
and I'm still "Mr. LuPone"...

15:28.333 --> 15:30.959
- Oh, come on.
- ...and "the little man."

15:30.959 --> 15:33.750
And it's-- it's funny,
but that's all right.

15:33.750 --> 15:36.708
I just-- I feel so lucky
to have her support.

15:36.708 --> 15:38.375
Patti:
Mind if I take off my bra?

15:38.375 --> 15:41.083
- Elijah: No.
- Sorry, it's that
time of the night.

15:43.959 --> 15:46.333
Joe:
We're trying to say exercise,
but not like--

15:46.333 --> 15:47.500
Karen:
Not like jock exercise.

15:47.500 --> 15:50.834
Right, it's, like,
specifically non-jock
exercise.

15:50.834 --> 15:51.834
Maybe more like
spiritual exercise.

15:51.834 --> 15:53.250
- Karen: Yeah, exactly.
- Joe: Thank you.

15:53.250 --> 15:55.750
Fine,
then how about,

15:55.750 --> 15:58.291
"The Couple That
Stretches Together...

15:59.917 --> 16:03.125
Namastes Together"?

16:03.125 --> 16:05.083
- Boom.
- No.

16:05.083 --> 16:07.000
Karen:
That's weird.
It's too pretentious.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.291
- Kevin.
- Kevin: It's spiritual.

16:08.291 --> 16:10.208
What the fuck
are we doing here?

16:10.208 --> 16:11.458
Lululemon
for men, hmm?

16:11.458 --> 16:15.291
No, seriously, like,
this is all bullshit,
isn't it?

16:15.291 --> 16:17.417
I mean, guys, we're
supposed to be writers

16:17.417 --> 16:19.041
and what's happening
at this table is honestly

16:19.041 --> 16:22.542
the biggest squanderization
of talent I have ever seen
in my life.

16:22.542 --> 16:24.375
"Squanderization"
is not even a word.

16:24.375 --> 16:25.708
- Okay, Karen, well...
- So...

16:25.708 --> 16:27.750
coming from the woman
who invented the term
"pantsaholic,"

16:27.750 --> 16:30.208
that means
next to nothing.

16:30.208 --> 16:33.834
- Okay, whoa.
- Wow, look at you.
Go, go, go.

16:33.834 --> 16:35.875
- Ouch.
- Okay, Kevin.

16:35.875 --> 16:37.875
Wanna talk
about your situation?

16:37.875 --> 16:39.041
Bring it.

16:39.041 --> 16:41.291
When are you gonna go
from calling yourself a poet

16:41.291 --> 16:43.291
to calling yourself
a "former poet"?

16:43.291 --> 16:46.291
Which is what you actually are
because you yourself told me

16:46.291 --> 16:49.000
you haven't written anything
of substance in five years,

16:49.000 --> 16:51.917
and rhyming
"need" with "tweed,"
it doesn't count.

16:51.917 --> 16:54.875
Oh, good one.
"You Got a Need for Tweed"
was a solid idea.

16:54.875 --> 16:58.583
You signed off on it,
and so did you and so did you,
and she loved it.

16:58.583 --> 17:01.000
- Okay.
- Listen, I think maybe we
should reconvene after lunch.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.291
- Karen: Yeah.
- Kevin: Yes.

17:02.291 --> 17:04.541
I think maybe
we should reconvene never.

17:04.541 --> 17:05.834
How about that?

17:05.834 --> 17:07.083
Am I seriously
the only one of us

17:07.083 --> 17:10.208
who prides herself
on being a truly
authentic person?

17:10.208 --> 17:11.583
This is
tripping me out.

17:11.583 --> 17:14.165
Well, gee, I'm sorry
we've let you down, Hannah.

17:14.165 --> 17:18.165
Okay, Joe, I'd love to see
some of that trademark wit
on the page.

17:18.165 --> 17:20.416
What the fuck
did I ever do to you

17:20.416 --> 17:23.458
besides treat you nice
and clean up your vomit?

17:23.458 --> 17:25.959
That was a private experience
that we shared, okay?

17:25.959 --> 17:28.290
I don't really appreciate
you airing our dirty laundry
in public.

17:28.290 --> 17:29.792
- We were all there.
- Yeah.

17:29.792 --> 17:33.375
I just expect
more from life.

17:33.375 --> 17:38.250
Seriously, I want every day
to be exciting and scary

17:38.250 --> 17:41.291
and a rollercoaster
of creative experience,

17:41.291 --> 17:44.375
as if I'm
making a new life
for myself in France.

17:44.375 --> 17:45.708
Well, Hannah,
you know what?

17:45.708 --> 17:48.417
Maybe this just
isn't the place for you.

17:48.417 --> 17:50.041
Maybe it's not
the place for me.

17:50.041 --> 17:51.500
Maybe it's not
the place for any of us.

17:51.500 --> 17:52.625
Did you think you were
gonna grow up and be in,

17:52.625 --> 17:54.792
like, a sweatshop factory
for puns?

17:54.792 --> 17:58.959
- Maybe this is a fucking
cooler for dead souls.
- Hannah, Hannah...

17:58.959 --> 18:01.458
- Maybe we're all hung up
like someone's--
- Hannah.

18:01.458 --> 18:04.625
- Yeah?
- You're fired.

18:04.625 --> 18:06.500
Okay.

18:06.500 --> 18:09.667
Well, Janice, you can't fire me,
because, actually I'm quitting.

18:09.667 --> 18:12.041
No, Hannah, come on.
Hannah.

18:12.041 --> 18:14.041
Joe, what do you
want from me?

18:14.041 --> 18:16.291
Does it
make you feel good
to have a chubby girl

18:16.291 --> 18:17.458
paying attention
to you?

18:17.458 --> 18:20.000
I'm not
the right conquest.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.166
What?

18:21.166 --> 18:23.625
So, thank you, Janice.
Thank you for the firing.

18:23.625 --> 18:26.166
It has made my life
so much better.

18:26.166 --> 18:28.000
You should all try it.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.417
( music playing )

18:38.333 --> 18:42.375
You know,
I'm just not happy

18:42.375 --> 18:44.625
with the image
of the bald guy.

18:44.625 --> 18:48.708
Um, okay, is it
the placement of the photo

18:48.708 --> 18:51.542
or maybe the height
on the wall?

18:51.542 --> 18:54.291
Why don't you
tell me?

18:54.291 --> 18:56.417
No, I'm not
qualified--

18:56.417 --> 18:58.458
Then how did you
get this job?

18:58.458 --> 19:00.708
I'm not
challenging you.

19:00.708 --> 19:02.959
- I'm just really curious.
- ( door opens )

19:02.959 --> 19:05.875
- Jessa, hi.
- Hey.

19:05.875 --> 19:07.875
Not a good time,
really.

19:07.875 --> 19:10.208
Yeah, I was just
down the street
applying for a job.

19:10.208 --> 19:11.875
I thought
I'd stop by.

19:11.875 --> 19:13.875
- Hi.
- This work is--

19:13.875 --> 19:16.166
By Bedelia,
who's the artist.

19:16.166 --> 19:18.750
- Hi.
- Bee-- Beedee--
Bedelia?

19:18.750 --> 19:22.917
- People call me Beedie.
- Beedie, okay, that's
a weird name.

19:22.917 --> 19:24.917
( whispers )
This really isn't
a good time.

19:24.917 --> 19:26.959
- This is your work?
- Yeah.

19:26.959 --> 19:29.583
I love it. It's really
invasive and exciting.

19:29.583 --> 19:31.417
- Really? Thank you.
- Marnie: Thank you.

19:31.417 --> 19:32.708
Except that one.

19:32.708 --> 19:35.291
- Jessa--
I'm so sorry, Beedie.
- Beedie: Really?

19:35.291 --> 19:37.166
You don't think it
should be in the show at all?

19:37.166 --> 19:38.875
No, I mean, it's--
no, it's fine.

19:38.875 --> 19:41.959
I happen to agree with you.
I think we should just
get rid of it.

19:41.959 --> 19:43.834
Amazing.

19:43.834 --> 19:45.250
- Amazing.
- Breakthrough.

19:45.250 --> 19:48.000
Let's just get rid of it.
All we do is talk about it.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.083
We talk about it
and talk about it.

19:50.083 --> 19:51.458
Well, anyway, I was
glad I could help.

19:51.458 --> 19:53.834
I am, you know,
gonna be on my way,
looking for work.

19:53.834 --> 19:56.667
- Wow, okay.
- Oh, really?
What kind of work?

19:56.667 --> 19:59.917
Well, anything that
doesn't market my sexuality.

19:59.917 --> 20:02.625
Okay, you know,
I'm kind of looking

20:02.625 --> 20:04.583
for someone
to do archival work.

20:04.583 --> 20:05.917
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

20:05.917 --> 20:07.250
What does that entail?

20:07.250 --> 20:09.417
It entails that I have
a lot of crap in my house

20:09.417 --> 20:12.083

to organize all the crap.

20:12.083 --> 20:13.291
- Okay.
- Okay?

20:13.291 --> 20:15.458
- Yeah, okay.
- Can you alphabetize?

20:15.458 --> 20:16.583
Yes, I can alphabetize.

20:16.583 --> 20:17.959
Why, did someone
tell you otherwise?

20:17.959 --> 20:21.291
- You come tomorrow?
- Yeah, that sounds good.
I'll be there.

20:21.291 --> 20:24.625
Okay, yeah. You're not
a junkie thief, are ya?

20:24.625 --> 20:26.041
No, not anymore.

20:26.041 --> 20:29.583

20:29.583 --> 20:30.959

tomorrow.

20:30.959 --> 20:32.417

I mean, like, Adam's
about to be on Broadway

23:21.041 --> 23:23.333
and Marnie's clearly
about to be a pop star
and, I don't know,

23:23.333 --> 23:25.166
you were supposed to be
the famous artist in this
group

23:25.166 --> 23:26.667
and now you're just
working in advertising.

23:26.667 --> 23:29.125
Well, I'm not working
in advertising anymore
because I quit today.

23:29.125 --> 23:30.250
Shh.

23:30.250 --> 23:34.083
- Also, this is--
- Please stop talking, ma'am.

23:34.083 --> 23:37.375
It was so good.
I would buy it
as a cassette single.

23:37.375 --> 23:38.500
Thank you.

23:38.500 --> 23:40.333
Yeah, Marnie, I have to tip
my tiny cap to you.

23:40.333 --> 23:42.375
You really, really--
you learned something

23:42.375 --> 23:44.166
that I didn't think
was possible to learn,

23:44.166 --> 23:45.333
which was presence.

23:45.333 --> 23:47.375
- You were so present.
- So beautiful.

23:47.375 --> 23:49.166
- Thank you, you guys.
- And you made
everyone else present.

23:49.166 --> 23:51.500
- Yeah.
- It's because
of this guy, honestly.

23:51.500 --> 23:54.000
He, like, was
so instrumental
in helping me.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.959
Well, he played an instrument,
but also, like...

23:55.959 --> 23:57.959
- he was so helpful
in teaching me how--
- Hello.

23:57.959 --> 24:00.333
Oh, mm.

24:00.333 --> 24:03.125
- You were so great!
- Oh, gracias, amor.

24:03.125 --> 24:06.667
And you added
some really interesting
textures and colors.

24:06.667 --> 24:08.667
- It was very nice.
- This is Clementine.

24:08.667 --> 24:10.333
Hi, I'm Marnie.
Nice to meet you.

24:10.333 --> 24:11.875
- Clem, hi.
- Yeah.

24:11.875 --> 24:13.166
I cannot
thank you enough.

24:13.166 --> 24:15.750
I've not seen him
so creatively revved up
in months.

24:15.750 --> 24:17.250
It is just
the best gift.

24:17.250 --> 24:20.917
Oh, that's so--
I mean, he's the best,
really.

24:20.917 --> 24:22.583
I know.

24:22.583 --> 24:24.875
You know, and he told me
you were gonna be nervous

24:24.875 --> 24:26.375
and you really weren't.
It was--

24:26.375 --> 24:29.166
you were so sweet,
so nice.

24:29.166 --> 24:32.208
Thank you so much.
That's so sweet of you to say.

24:32.208 --> 24:34.041
You're saying I'm sweet.
I'm saying you're sweet.

24:34.041 --> 24:37.208
It's sweet,
so, thank you.

24:37.208 --> 24:40.041
So, are we gonna
meet the cast or what?

24:40.041 --> 24:41.708
Oh, shit, yeah.
We should go.

24:41.708 --> 24:43.166
Do you guys
want to join us?

24:43.166 --> 24:45.125
Uh, I just remembered
I can't.

24:45.125 --> 24:48.875
I'm tutoring a homeless kid
tomorrow morning.

24:48.875 --> 24:49.875
Oh.

24:49.875 --> 24:52.375
Yeah, and I got a dinner
with this guy I met

24:52.375 --> 24:54.667
at the
Kenneth Cole outlet.

24:56.041 --> 24:57.583
Desi:
You be safe.

25:07.250 --> 25:09.625
- Hi.
- Hey, what's going on?

25:12.000 --> 25:13.250
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:13.250 --> 25:15.250
I thought we said
we weren't gonna
do this anymore.

25:15.250 --> 25:19.041
Yeah, you  said that,
but I never signed off
on anything.

25:21.458 --> 25:22.500
Hey, look, wait.

25:22.500 --> 25:25.417
Look, I'm not opposed
to the general idea

25:25.417 --> 25:26.750
of where this
seems to be headed.

25:26.750 --> 25:30.166
Okay, I'm not,
but I do think we
should try to nail down

25:30.166 --> 25:31.291
the specifics
of what this means

25:31.291 --> 25:34.333
in a more
global macro sense.

25:34.333 --> 25:36.041
Okay, Ray,
yeah, you do that.

25:36.041 --> 25:38.125
And whenever
you're done doing that,

25:38.125 --> 25:41.041
I'm gonna be in here
waiting for you...

25:41.041 --> 25:43.083
naked.

25:46.750 --> 25:49.125
( faintly )
Okay.

25:52.500 --> 25:54.458
So he decides
his choice

25:54.458 --> 25:57.959
is that he is going to
climb the fourth wall.

25:57.959 --> 25:59.041
- Desi: Oh, no.
- Clementine: What?

25:59.041 --> 26:02.458
You know the story.
Not break it, climb it.

26:02.458 --> 26:03.500
What did that
look like?

26:03.500 --> 26:05.375
Okay, it looked
a little something like this.

26:06.291 --> 26:08.708
( panting )

26:08.708 --> 26:11.625
Hangs off a little,
looks down-- oh, God.

26:11.625 --> 26:15.834
Gets up,
looks at the audience,
looks back at me.

26:15.834 --> 26:17.500
I'm just like,
"How do I...?"

26:17.500 --> 26:20.208
- Fuck this guy.
- And if you ask him about it,

26:20.208 --> 26:23.125
he has-- he says
he has zero memory of it.

26:23.125 --> 26:25.458
Adam:
I have a new respect
for that guy now.

26:25.458 --> 26:28.208
( all laughing )

26:29.375 --> 26:32.208
I got fired
from my job today.

26:34.875 --> 26:38.000
- You what?
- I got fired from my job.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.291
- Sorry.
- No, this is good.

26:40.291 --> 26:42.708
You have the floor,
Adam's girlfriend.

26:42.708 --> 26:46.250
Okay, it's Hannah,
and I should clarify

26:46.250 --> 26:48.625
I intentionally got fired.
I wanted to get fired,

26:48.625 --> 26:51.625
and I succeeded
with flying colors.

26:51.625 --> 26:55.000
- Why'd you get fired?
- Why'd you want  to get fired?

26:55.000 --> 26:56.917
I got fired so I could
receive my unemployment

26:56.917 --> 27:01.625
'cause Mama is gonna
need that unemployment.

27:03.583 --> 27:05.166
( scoffs )

27:06.583 --> 27:08.417
She's gonna get it.

27:10.333 --> 27:11.208
Ahem.

27:11.208 --> 27:14.000
Woman:
You guys want more drinks?

27:14.000 --> 27:16.291
Hannah:
I think your friends
really liked me.

27:16.291 --> 27:18.291
( Adam groaning )

27:19.333 --> 27:21.959
Don't knock me
into things, okay?

27:21.959 --> 27:23.917
Be careful with me,
please.

27:23.917 --> 27:25.834
Precious cargo.

27:25.834 --> 27:28.000
Ow.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.500
Gentle.

27:29.500 --> 27:32.917
Your theater friends
are very theatery.

27:32.917 --> 27:34.417
- Shh.
- Have you noticed that?

27:34.417 --> 27:36.166
( whispers )
Don't want to
wake up Ray.

27:36.166 --> 27:39.208
Well, I don't care
about waking up Ray
because you know what?

27:39.208 --> 27:42.792
Ray's a dick.
It's about time we all
just acknowledged it.

27:42.792 --> 27:45.041
I'm so glad you're getting
the fuck out of here.

27:45.041 --> 27:46.375
Yeah.

27:46.375 --> 27:47.792
After opening night, right?

27:47.792 --> 27:52.458
Well, I don't think
we can set an exact time.

27:52.458 --> 27:54.917
Are you serious?

27:56.500 --> 27:59.083
( kissing, groans )

27:59.083 --> 28:01.583
( Marnie moaning )

28:01.583 --> 28:02.917
Do you hear that?

28:02.917 --> 28:06.250
- ( Ray moaning )
- Yeah, it sounds like
Ray's got company.

28:06.250 --> 28:08.041
( moaning continues )

28:08.041 --> 28:09.500
Excuse me.

28:09.500 --> 28:11.959
Hannah, what the fuck?
It's none of your business.

28:11.959 --> 28:14.083
Everything's
my business.

28:18.917 --> 28:20.333
( screams )

28:20.333 --> 28:21.750
( both yell )

28:21.750 --> 28:23.166
Are you fucking kidding me?

28:23.166 --> 28:24.959
What the fuck
are you doing?

28:24.959 --> 28:28.583
This is America,
you don't just barge into
someone's fucking bedroom.

28:28.583 --> 28:30.917
Put your dick away.

28:30.917 --> 28:31.959
- Adam?
- Yes?

28:31.959 --> 28:34.959
- Did you know
this was going on?
- No.

28:34.959 --> 28:37.625
- He made me.
- Ray: What?

28:37.625 --> 28:40.959
You will never
judge me again.
