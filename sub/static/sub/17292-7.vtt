[Rebecca]
<i>Previously on</i> Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...

00:02.628 --> 00:05.214
I've had the best time hanging out
with the both of you.

00:05.297 --> 00:07.090
I think it's official that we're a squad.

00:07.174 --> 00:08.717
-You gonna drink that extra juice box?
-Take it.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.260
-Thanks.
-That's my best friend.

00:10.344 --> 00:12.387
She just had that "me, me, me, me" vibe.

00:12.471 --> 00:14.097
You don't think
that Paula feels left out, right?

00:14.181 --> 00:15.891
She doesn't feel like I've replaced her.

00:15.974 --> 00:20.229
Introducing the newest member
of our girl group, Pa-Pa-Pa-Paula.

00:20.312 --> 00:21.980
[Paula] <i>Our relationship</i>
<i>has always been one-sided.</i>

00:22.064 --> 00:24.691
I give, you take,
and that is how it works.

00:27.236 --> 00:29.738
-Hey.
-I work out.

00:29.821 --> 00:31.240
[giggles]

00:31.323 --> 00:32.741
[sighs, chuckles]

00:32.824 --> 00:34.701
Move up. Quit texting your new girlfriend.

00:34.785 --> 00:36.912
Um, Anna is not my new girlfriend.

00:36.995 --> 00:38.956
We've only been out
on three amazing dates.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.082
[laughs]

00:40.165 --> 00:43.418
Sorry. Just-- Anna texted me a picture
of a cat dressed up like a dog.

00:43.502 --> 00:45.254
Where does she find this stuff?

00:47.422 --> 00:49.800

Yeah, you are.
[laughs]

01:50.694 --> 01:54.281
Hey, P.P., what happened
to all your fun desk stuff?

01:54.364 --> 01:56.783
I am rebranding.

01:57.576 --> 02:00.787
And, for starters,
don't ever call me P.P. again.

02:00.871 --> 02:02.456
Oh, wait a minute.

02:02.539 --> 02:04.249
Now, you're not gonna throw out

02:04.333 --> 02:07.878
the "Honk if you're horny,
Paula Proctor is 40" bumper sticker!

02:07.961 --> 02:11.632
-That's classic.
-I have new interests now, Darryl.

02:12.883 --> 02:14.551
Oh, hello, Darryl. Good morning.

02:15.719 --> 02:21.433
And good morning... this guy.
You are looking very well.

02:21.516 --> 02:24.311
Yeah, thanks.
Actually, my mother found a lump--

02:24.394 --> 02:26.480
[laughs]
You're so funny.

02:26.563 --> 02:28.607
You're my favorite person
in this three-foot radius.

02:28.690 --> 02:33.028
Well, that's nice to hear 'cause
the doctor was crying when he told us.

02:33.111 --> 02:34.905
So, it's... it's probably not good.

02:34.988 --> 02:38.533
Yeah, uh-huh. Okay, cool.
We'll talk about this later, best friend.

02:38.617 --> 02:40.160
Okay. That's fine.

02:42.079 --> 02:43.455
Are you and Rebecca still fighting?

02:44.373 --> 02:47.209
Come on, you guys are besties.
Someone should apologize.

02:47.292 --> 02:49.920
-I don't want to take sides.
-No one needs you to do anything.

02:50.003 --> 02:50.879
[sighs]

02:50.962 --> 02:54.173
I wonder what selfish person would
hog all the pink highlighters.

02:54.257 --> 02:56.259
Oh! Look at that.

02:56.343 --> 02:57.678
There they are.

03:01.223 --> 03:02.432
[copier whirs]

03:03.850 --> 03:07.854
I know what you want, you know.
You want me to apologize.

03:07.938 --> 03:09.564
You know what, though?
I'm not gonna apologize. You know why?
I'm always the one who apologizes.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.360
Usually, it's because
I'm the one that did the bad thing.

03:13.443 --> 03:16.195
But not this time, not this time.
You owe me the apology this time.

03:16.279 --> 03:17.906
You want to know why?
You want to know why?

03:17.989 --> 03:19.324
Because you came to my girl party

03:19.408 --> 03:21.284
and you were rude to everyone,
you were rude to me,

03:21.368 --> 03:23.245
you tried to leave early,
you broke my new house, and--

03:23.328 --> 03:26.456
Oh, look, I know you and I
are not in a great place,

03:26.540 --> 03:28.667
but I have a big paper due next week.

03:28.750 --> 03:29.876
I gotta go.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.713
Paula, Paula, Paula...

03:35.090 --> 03:37.259
We gotta find some way
to make this better.

03:38.844 --> 03:39.845
I know.

03:41.805 --> 03:43.348
I just don't know how.

03:55.152 --> 03:58.071
Hey, babe, you seen my vest and bow tie?

03:58.155 --> 04:00.824
I need to get my barbershop
quartet outfit dry-cleaned.

04:00.907 --> 04:03.744
Oh, I think it's still at the dry cleaners
from your last performance.

04:03.827 --> 04:08.248
I hope they didn't give it away.
Quartet outfits are a collector's item.

04:08.331 --> 04:10.667
Hey, you might want to get
to the office party

04:10.751 --> 04:12.419
a little bit early on Friday.

04:12.502 --> 04:14.838
The white wine flies off the card table.

04:14.921 --> 04:19.176
Oh, I hear that. Nothing I like better
than a warm Costco white.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.302
[both chuckle]

04:20.385 --> 04:21.386
God, I'm so nervous.

04:21.470 --> 04:24.306
This is the first time I'll be singing
in front of the co-workers.

04:24.389 --> 04:27.392
This is a huge gig for us.
We even have an opener.

04:27.476 --> 04:31.271
The boss' kids are doing
the first act of <i>Hamilton.</i>

04:34.483 --> 04:39.237
What are you reading? You're so into it.
Is it one of your sexy vampire books?

04:39.321 --> 04:40.405
No.

04:40.489 --> 04:45.619
It is a fascinating Supreme Court case
from 1880 called Yick Wo versus Hopkins,

04:45.702 --> 04:47.579
where the city of San Francisco had said

04:47.662 --> 04:50.791
that it was illegal to operate laundries
in a wooden building,

04:50.874 --> 04:53.543
but the reason they did that
was because

04:53.627 --> 04:57.380
two-thirds of the wooden laundries
were operated by Chinese owners.

04:57.464 --> 05:01.551
So, do you know
what that court did? [sighs]

05:01.635 --> 05:04.846
They used the Equal Protection Clause
from the 14th Amendment

05:04.930 --> 05:08.767
to find that law discriminatory.

05:09.893 --> 05:10.936
Boom.

05:11.728 --> 05:13.313
[chuckles]

05:13.772 --> 05:14.815
Cool.

05:14.898 --> 05:18.401
-Right?
-Laundry is tough. We know that.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.695
We have a stack on the washer
up to the ceiling.

05:20.779 --> 05:23.782
Uh, hey, do you need a plus one
for Rebecca for Friday?

05:23.865 --> 05:26.034
For Rebecca? What? No. No way.

05:26.117 --> 05:29.287
Are you guys still fighting?
You should call her, work it out.

05:29.371 --> 05:31.998
I'm not gonna call her. She can call me.
She's got my number.

05:32.082 --> 05:33.959
She's being such a petty child.

05:34.042 --> 05:37.462
And she started it. She's such a baby.

05:38.337 --> 05:39.172
[scoffs]

05:49.683 --> 05:50.684
[camera clicks]

05:53.687 --> 05:56.106
-Hi.
-Hey, babe.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.357
-[grunts]
-Oh. Sorry I'm so late.

05:58.441 --> 06:00.569
Are you ready for the best coffee
you've ever had in your life?

06:00.652 --> 06:02.361
-Hell to the yeah!
-[both laugh]

06:02.445 --> 06:05.073
I can't believe it's been three weeks
and I haven't taken you here yet.

06:05.156 --> 06:07.576
I've been coming to this place
ever since it was just a pop-up.

06:07.659 --> 06:09.494
Oh, cool.

06:09.578 --> 06:12.414
-[to himself] What?
-Hey, Ichabod. The usual, please.

06:12.497 --> 06:16.167
You got it, Anna. One semi-petite latte
with organic coconut milk.

06:16.251 --> 06:18.461
-And you, sir?
-Just coffee for me, dude.

06:19.671 --> 06:23.174
-What kind? It's all up there.
-Oh, okay.

06:23.258 --> 06:24.509
[inhales deeply]
Ooh.

06:24.593 --> 06:27.596
You've got single origin, blended,
micro-lot, Indian filter,

06:27.679 --> 06:30.515
French press, Clover, Turkish,
Kyoto drip, Neapolitan flip,

06:30.599 --> 06:32.517
V60, moka pot, drip pot, automatic drip.

06:32.601 --> 06:34.769
[inhales deeply]
Um...

06:34.853 --> 06:36.354
Single origin, I guess.

06:36.438 --> 06:37.522
[chuckles]

06:38.356 --> 06:41.151
Which single origin?
We have 17 different kinds.

06:44.321 --> 06:46.531
Uh...

06:46.615 --> 06:49.117
You know what?
Uh, you pick your fave.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.287
-You got it.
-Cool.

07:00.503 --> 07:03.506
-This is awesome. I gotta remember it.
-[phone beeps]

07:03.590 --> 07:10.513
Note, Silver Brew in Silver Lake.
Repeat, Silver Brew in Silver Lake.

07:10.597 --> 07:11.932
Taylor loves this place.

07:12.015 --> 07:14.976
She brought me here with Lena,
Cara, Gwynnie, Selena, and Uzo.

07:15.060 --> 07:18.438
All really great girls, except Uzo
is a little bit of a name dropper.

07:18.521 --> 07:21.483
I can't believe you know
all these famous people

07:21.566 --> 07:23.735
just from tweezing their eyebrows
at your salon.

07:23.818 --> 07:27.697
Well, it's not always about the tweezing.
Sometimes, it's about not tweezing.

07:27.781 --> 07:31.034
Sometimes, I send my clients on,
like, six-month growth retreats.

07:31.117 --> 07:34.913
It's all about the bold brow right now.
The bigger, the better.

07:34.996 --> 07:38.083
-Oh! Like the dad in <i>American Pie</i>?
-Eugene Levy?

07:38.166 --> 07:41.503
Yes, totally. He's all over
the salon inspiration board.

07:41.586 --> 07:44.756
Before I met you, I didn't even know
eyebrows were, like, a big deal.

07:44.839 --> 07:47.300
-Oh, that's what I love about you.
-Love me?

07:47.384 --> 07:51.429
-Love about you.
-Oh, yeah, got it.

07:51.513 --> 07:53.807
You're so... refreshing.

07:53.890 --> 07:56.476
I'm so tired of these skinny,
bearded hipsters.

07:56.559 --> 07:59.604
Thank God I'm not skinny, or hip,
or able to grow a beard. [chuckles]

07:59.688 --> 08:03.066
-I like you just the way you are.
-Oh. [chuckles]

08:03.149 --> 08:05.777
So, Anna, I got you something.

08:05.860 --> 08:08.780
I know. We've only been seeing
each other a couple weeks.

08:08.863 --> 08:11.157
It's probably a little early
to pop the gift bubble,

08:11.241 --> 08:12.409
but this is technically not for you.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.994
Josh, what did you do?

08:14.995 --> 08:18.373
Oh, I got you a present.
Sorry, I thought that was clear.

08:18.456 --> 08:21.751
-Okay, close your eyes.
-Okay.

08:25.046 --> 08:26.423
Okay. Open 'em!

08:26.506 --> 08:27.340
[gasps]

08:28.299 --> 08:32.971
-I got you a cat collar for your cat!
-Oh, my gosh. This is so cute, Josh.

08:33.054 --> 08:36.016
Gravy's gonna be the best dressed cat
in Silver Lake.

08:36.099 --> 08:38.727
-You're so sweet. Thank you.
-I love that cat.

08:38.810 --> 08:43.231
I've never loved a cat before, seriously.
I've always thought they were haunted.

08:43.314 --> 08:44.482
Here you go.

08:45.316 --> 08:48.278
Whoa! That foam has a lady's face!

08:48.361 --> 08:50.780
Frida Kahlo? Well done, Ichabod.

08:50.864 --> 08:53.700
That is my girl right there.
Talk about brows.

08:53.783 --> 08:55.660
I wish I had her hormone imbalance.

08:55.744 --> 08:59.247
[both laughing]

08:59.330 --> 09:01.666
Oh. [laughs]
Yeah, sorry, I didn't hear the...

09:01.750 --> 09:04.961
[laughs]
Wow.

09:14.721 --> 09:18.391
[sighing]
Oh, this is so great. Hanging out...

09:18.475 --> 09:21.269
You know, friends your own age,
who don't judge you...

09:21.352 --> 09:23.104
So, you're still in a fight with Paula?

09:23.188 --> 09:25.815
Because you keep bringing her up
without saying her name.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.901
Just, like, call her and work it out.

09:27.984 --> 09:30.612
I'm not gonna call her.
She can call me. She has my number.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.947
Forget about Paula.
We are having young fun.

09:33.031 --> 09:34.282
What you up to, Heath?

09:34.365 --> 09:37.202
Um, it's "Heather,"
and I'm just doing a Miss Douche AMA.

09:37.285 --> 09:41.372
A lot of questions about baking bread.
People are really confused about yeast.

09:41.456 --> 09:43.708
-What about you, V?
-Oh, just surfin'.

09:43.792 --> 09:46.836
The Internet is so much more fun
now that it's a Josh Chan-free zone.

09:46.920 --> 09:50.256
-I am so glad we unfollowed him.
-Oh, my God. Me, too. I feel that.

09:50.340 --> 09:53.635
Oh, you both unfollowed him?
You really stuck it to him, huh?

09:53.718 --> 09:54.886
Yeah, it's pretty amazing.

09:54.969 --> 09:57.680
I don't even have an urge
to look at his feed anymore.

09:57.764 --> 10:01.559
It's like, "Who cares?"

10:04.896 --> 10:07.482
-Hmm?
-What you got there, girlfriend?

10:07.565 --> 10:09.234
Oh, nothing. It's just an Internet quiz

10:09.317 --> 10:11.986
to figure out what Tom Hanks movie
my hairstyle is today.

10:17.117 --> 10:20.286
-Uh, what?
-What you got going on there, girlfriend?

10:20.370 --> 10:24.791
Oh, nothing. Just watching
another pimple popper video.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.501
[chuckles]
Blech.

10:26.584 --> 10:29.129
Mm. Cool.

10:29.212 --> 10:31.840
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool,
cool, cool, cool, cool.

10:31.923 --> 10:35.468
-Coolio.
-Yeah, I love Coolio.

10:35.552 --> 10:39.389
Yeah, "Gangsta's Paradise"?
[scoffs] Forget it. I miss that guy.

10:40.807 --> 10:44.227
Yup, yup. Mm-hmm.
Yup, I miss him. I miss him.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.772
I'm sorry. You guys miss Coolio?

10:47.856 --> 10:49.190
Yeah-huh.

10:49.274 --> 10:51.776
Mm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

10:54.779 --> 10:55.780
Silver Brew?

10:55.864 --> 10:57.282
-What?
-Nothing.

11:04.789 --> 11:07.292
-Oh, my God. Who is that?
-What?

11:07.375 --> 11:11.087
Oh, nothing. I just always forget
which Kardashian is which.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.589
Oh, okay. Describe her for me.

11:12.671 --> 11:14.799
Is she the tall one, the naked one,

21:02.011 --> 21:07.683
Yeah, it was a man with, um, a hat
and-and one eye and a parrot here.

21:07.767 --> 21:10.269
A pirate? A pirate hit my cat?
That's insane.

21:10.352 --> 21:13.439
Yeah, it was-- it was insane.
That's why she remembers it so vividly.

21:13.522 --> 21:16.484
It was a guy with yellow teeth
and black eyeliner.

21:16.567 --> 21:18.360
I bet it's one of those creeps

21:18.444 --> 21:19.862
who plays Jack Sparrow
on Hollywood Boulevard.

21:19.945 --> 21:22.364
-Oh!
-[Rebecca] Yup. Um, hey.

21:22.448 --> 21:25.117
We were-- We were just gonna drive
your cat to the hospital.

21:25.201 --> 21:28.788
-Why don't we take you, too?
-[whispering] What?

21:28.871 --> 21:30.331
-What are you talking about?
-It's fine. Shh!

21:35.336 --> 21:37.379
This is all my fault.

21:37.463 --> 21:40.007
I was on the phone
and I left the door open.

21:40.090 --> 21:42.301
If anything happens to him,
I don't know what I'll do.

21:42.384 --> 21:43.427
[door opens]

21:45.262 --> 21:47.181
Will you excuse me for one moment?

21:47.264 --> 21:49.433
-[door closes]
-[sighs]

21:50.518 --> 21:52.853
What are we doing? I'm over there
all by myself comforting the enemy,

21:52.937 --> 21:54.188
who smells like heaven, by the way.

21:54.271 --> 21:57.525
-I want to get out of here.
-Shh, shh, shh. Just play cool, okay?

21:57.608 --> 22:00.528
So, listen, it hit me
when we hit the cat. [chuckles]

22:00.611 --> 22:03.656
We can't just tell Josh
about Anna's drug business.

22:03.739 --> 22:05.616
He'll never believe us, okay?
We need proof.

22:05.699 --> 22:07.743
So, I intend to do just that.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.119
Before you go over there,

22:09.203 --> 22:12.748
I told her that your name is Madge
and my name is Allegra.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.751
-Madge?
-So you.

22:16.418 --> 22:18.754
-Great.
-Yeah, go. Go, go, go.

22:19.755 --> 22:23.592
Hey. Hey, honey. So, the nurse wants you
to fill out all this information.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.594
I just figured I'd do it
since you're so upset.

22:25.678 --> 22:26.971
-So, it's just you and me.
-Okay.

22:27.054 --> 22:29.265
Don't think, just rapid fire
answer my questions.

22:29.347 --> 22:31.767

So, stay with me, stay with me.
Rapid fire.

22:41.485 --> 22:42.486
-Okay.
-Stay with me, okay?

22:46.991 --> 22:48.576
-You're going too fast.
-Okay, got it.

22:48.659 --> 22:51.328
I will go slower, okay? I'll slow it down,
but still rapid fire with me, okay?

22:51.412 --> 22:52.538
Right with me? Rapid fire?

22:52.621 --> 22:54.206
-Okay. So, name?
-Anna Hicks.

22:54.290 --> 22:55.416
-Okay, age?
-Twenty-nine.

22:55.499 --> 22:58.586
Older than I thought. Good for you.
Um, height, weight, rapid fire?

22:58.669 --> 23:01.088
-Five-three. I don't weigh myself.
-Yes, you do. Everyone does.

23:01.171 --> 23:02.882
-No, I really don't.
-Put down 115, Madge.

23:02.965 --> 23:06.010
Got it. Um, okay. So many questions
on this stupid form.

23:06.093 --> 23:07.803
-It's so thorough. I don't know why.
-[door opens]

23:07.887 --> 23:09.096
Any-- Any run-ins with the law?

23:09.179 --> 23:10.431

-Like, felonies, misdemeanors?

23:10.514 --> 23:14.392
Oh, my God! Is he dead? No!

23:14.476 --> 23:18.230
He's just fine. We reattached his tail
and he's gonna be A-ok.

23:18.314 --> 23:20.232
Oh, thank God. My little Gravy Wavy.

23:20.316 --> 23:23.068
We just didn't want this collar to get
lost in the shuffle. It's so pretty.

23:23.152 --> 23:26.488
Thank you.
My boyfriend got it for me. Thanks.

23:26.572 --> 23:27.907
-[sighs]
-Oh.

23:27.990 --> 23:29.992
So, you have-- you have--
you have a boyfriend, huh?

23:30.075 --> 23:32.369
That was the next question
on this weird form.

23:32.453 --> 23:34.705
You have a-- So you-- Yes to--
Yes, boyfriend, yes?

23:34.788 --> 23:39.417
Yeah. I haven't said it out loud yet,
but, um, I guess he is my boyfriend.

23:39.501 --> 23:42.129
It's funny how hard moments make you
realize who really matters to you.

23:42.880 --> 23:43.964
Mmm.

23:47.301 --> 23:51.013
You know, um, since Gravy's A-ok,
why don't I take your mind off of this?

23:51.096 --> 23:54.266
And we'll just gab like girls.
Tell me about the boyfriend, girlfriend.

23:54.350 --> 23:56.060
-[chuckles]
-Um, his name is Josh,

23:56.143 --> 23:58.270
and we've only been seeing each other
for a couple weeks,

23:58.354 --> 24:02.107
so I guess it's casual,
but he's so nice, so helpful.

24:02.191 --> 24:05.569
I've been slammed at the salon lately,
and he's been helping me out a ton,

24:05.653 --> 24:08.280
making deliveries, pickups,
going to Mexico to get product.

24:08.364 --> 24:10.157
-Mexico?
-Oh, my God.

24:10.240 --> 24:13.077
And he doesn't even ask
any questions. He's so nice.

24:13.160 --> 24:16.121
And I feel bad for him. He's been
through some really tough times.

24:16.205 --> 24:17.790
Had some toxic relationships.

24:17.873 --> 24:21.377
Toxic? Is that-- Is that his word,
your word, or Britney's word?

24:21.459 --> 24:22.962
His word, "toxic."

24:23.045 --> 24:24.713
He doesn't like to badmouth his exes,

24:24.797 --> 24:27.465
but this one girl he dated
hounded him to propose.

24:27.549 --> 24:30.761
Hounded? Is that his word,
your word, or Elvis' word?

24:30.844 --> 24:31.887
His word, "hounded."

24:31.971 --> 24:35.599
And then, he dated this psycho,
who, get this, quit her job,

24:35.683 --> 24:37.977
and then moved across the country
to be with him,

24:38.060 --> 24:40.688
even though they hadn't seen
each other in, like, ten years.

24:40.771 --> 24:41.814
Crazy, right?

24:41.897 --> 24:44.233
[muttering]
That also could be unfair, you know.

24:44.316 --> 24:46.360
That could be the male gaze
version of the narrative.

24:46.443 --> 24:49.071
No, this girl sounded legit bonker balls.

24:49.154 --> 24:51.031
She told him
that she was pregnant with his baby,

24:51.115 --> 24:53.659
and then, two seconds later, said
that she wasn't pregnant with his baby,

24:53.742 --> 24:56.203
and then begged him to have period sex.

24:56.286 --> 24:58.914
Excuse me, what happened?

24:58.998 --> 25:00.249
[babbling]

25:00.332 --> 25:01.625
Let's not slut-shame a lady

25:01.709 --> 25:04.044
just because her libido doesn't
go away during menstruation.

25:04.128 --> 25:06.630
That girl, whoever she is,
should be commended.

-Okay.

When Josh finds out who ran over Gravy,
he's going to flip.

25:14.555 --> 25:16.223
He absolutely loves this cat.

25:16.306 --> 25:20.269
Right, but, I mean,
how is he even gonna find her-- him?

25:20.352 --> 25:22.187
The salon security footage.

25:23.355 --> 25:24.898
-What?
-What?

25:24.982 --> 25:26.942
I took over the salon from a jeweler,

25:27.026 --> 25:28.777
so the entire front of the salon
has cameras.

25:29.945 --> 25:32.823
Josh and I are gonna find the person
who ran over my baby

25:32.906 --> 25:34.825
if it's the last thing that I do.

25:36.201 --> 25:38.162
Did you hear that, Madge?

25:39.705 --> 25:41.707
I did, Allegra.

25:45.294 --> 25:48.130
Oh, yeah. We could buy--
We could buy that place, or--

25:48.213 --> 25:50.548
This place looks quite promising.
Maybe we could buy--

25:50.632 --> 25:52.301
Okay, look, I was trying
to mislead the neighbors

25:52.384 --> 25:54.636
to make them think we're lesbians
looking for a new house.

or we are absolute toast.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.058
How are we gonna get in?

25:59.141 --> 26:01.435
Do you have a diamond ring
that we could use to cut glass?

26:01.518 --> 26:03.395
Maybe there's a kitty door
or something like--

26:03.479 --> 26:06.774
-How about we use these?
-Oh, my God. She has the cutest stuff.

26:06.857 --> 26:08.692
-Wait, wait, wait. You stole those?
-Yes.

26:08.776 --> 26:10.486

30:58.357 --> 31:05.155
Okay, delete, delete, delete, delete.
Empty trash. Oh! Thank God. Yes. Phew!

31:05.238 --> 31:07.991
Oh, what a weight off me.
I wish I could do that in my own life,

31:08.075 --> 31:10.494
just erase things that happened.

31:10.577 --> 31:14.039
God, I would erase
all of junior prom and sixth grade

31:14.122 --> 31:15.582
and so many courtroom farts.

31:15.665 --> 31:18.752
-Okay, great! Let's get out of here.
-Wait, wait, wait. It just occurred to me.

31:18.835 --> 31:20.754
If she's doing anything illegal,
it would be on these tapes.

31:20.837 --> 31:23.590
-We could show them to Josh.
-I really don't want to get caught.

31:23.673 --> 31:26.843
V, look, I know this is dangerous,
and I know how we both feel about Josh,

31:26.927 --> 31:29.262
but he's an innocent man
being turned into a drug mule.

31:29.346 --> 31:31.014
Yeah, God only knows
what he's sticking in his rectum.

31:31.098 --> 31:33.016
-Oh, my God. Have we talked about that?
-What?

31:33.100 --> 31:34.101
Oh, so he never...

31:34.976 --> 31:37.312
Nothing. Mm-mm, mm-mm.
Nope. Mm-mm.

31:37.396 --> 31:38.605
What was I doing? Oh, right.

31:38.688 --> 31:41.191
I'm gonna fast forward through this
to see if she is a hopper moving g-pack.

31:41.274 --> 31:43.193
She's no corner boy.
She's pushing real weight.

31:44.152 --> 31:45.654
-Ugh.
-It's <i>The Wire.</i>

31:46.488 --> 31:49.574
-Have you never seen <i>The Wire</i>?
-Mm, am I supposed to?

31:49.658 --> 31:51.326
Oh, my God.
I'm so jealous of you right now.

31:51.410 --> 31:52.786
You get to watch it from the beginning.

31:52.869 --> 31:56.540
Paula and I binged the whole thing
in two days, and we were obsessed.

31:56.623 --> 31:59.835
We talked like Avon
and Stringer Bell for a solid month.

31:59.918 --> 32:02.337
Um, wait, why am I talking about Paula?
I hate her right now.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.423
Okay, fast forward. Let's see.

32:04.506 --> 32:07.467
She's plucking, she's plucking,
she's plucking, more plucking.

32:07.551 --> 32:09.094
-Oh, there it is, there it is!
-[gasps]

32:09.177 --> 32:11.888
Look, she's handing
envelopes of drugs to clients.

32:11.972 --> 32:13.974
-Whoa.
-This is insane.

32:14.057 --> 32:16.601
She's giving envelopes full of drugs
to people out in broad daylight.

32:16.685 --> 32:17.978
It's so brazen.

32:18.061 --> 32:20.272
This is such important work.
We're gonna blow this wide open.

32:20.355 --> 32:21.773
We could get a Peabody for this.

32:21.857 --> 32:23.650
Look, look! She's taking the powder
out of the envelope,

32:23.733 --> 32:25.110
and then she's putting it on the table. She's showing them how to do the drugs.

32:28.238 --> 32:30.240
Oh, she's gonna shoot up the drugs
just like in <i>Breaking Bad.</i>

32:30.323 --> 32:31.950
-Have you seen <i>Breaking Bad</i>?
-Eh.

32:32.033 --> 32:33.326
How do you live your life?

32:33.410 --> 32:34.995
-I go outside.
-That's fair.

32:35.078 --> 32:37.205
-Okay, here we go, here we go.
-Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

32:37.289 --> 32:39.624
She's gonna do the drugs!
She's getting high off her own supply.

32:39.708 --> 32:42.210
-It's going in her mouth.
-No, no, no. It's going up her nose.

32:42.294 --> 32:45.297
Nope, nope, nope.
It's going on her eyebrows.

32:45.380 --> 32:46.882
She's putting coke on her eyebrows?

32:46.965 --> 32:49.426
Is that a thing? Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

32:49.509 --> 32:50.510
She's-- She's saying something.

32:50.594 --> 32:52.888
Let me-- Give me a second.
I can lip read pretty well.

32:53.930 --> 32:56.183
My semester abroad,
I took a deaf lover, okay?

32:56.266 --> 32:58.727
All right. Uh, oh, she's about
to say something. Okay.

32:58.810 --> 33:03.231
"Put this on your eyebrows
two times a day for a month,

33:03.315 --> 33:06.860
and you will see a significant change
in your eyebrow growth."

33:08.236 --> 33:10.697
-Oh.
-Oh, it makes your eyebrows grow.

33:11.907 --> 33:14.618
Well, that's brilliant...

33:14.701 --> 33:15.702
and disappointing.

33:15.785 --> 33:18.747
-[scoffs] Yeah.
-I guess that means that--

33:18.830 --> 33:21.791
It means that Josh is dating
a super fly entrepreneur,

33:21.875 --> 33:25.670
who's probably just using products
that haven't been outwardly cleared

33:25.754 --> 33:28.048
by the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetics Act.

33:28.131 --> 33:29.049
Great.

33:35.430 --> 33:38.391
-Look, I said I was sorry.
-You're not sorry.

33:38.475 --> 33:41.561
No, well, I-- I heard the last note
and it was beautiful.

33:41.645 --> 33:44.648
Okay, okay. I messed up
and this is all my fault.

33:44.731 --> 33:47.359
You know how much the Brovinas
mean to me, but you don't care.

33:47.442 --> 33:50.570
I do care. I just-- I should have set
an alarm or something.

33:50.654 --> 33:52.781
-I got caught up in something.
-Law thing?

33:52.864 --> 33:56.576
Oh, well, yeah. And I-- You know what?
But it's wrong and I know that now.

33:56.660 --> 33:59.871
I have been so supportive,
and I think what you're doing is great.

33:59.955 --> 34:02.415
But I feel left out.
You're so distracted lately.

34:02.499 --> 34:06.378
Well, I know, I know, but I--
Look, I-I will try to do better.

34:06.461 --> 34:11.258
I was great out there, Paula.
I nailed that low A.

34:11.341 --> 34:13.802
Hank's wife said
I sounded like Lou Rawls.

34:13.885 --> 34:17.722
Tanya from shipping bought six CDs
for her care packages for the troops.

34:17.806 --> 34:23.645
Does she not support the troops?
Wow. Fair, fair. Horrible time for a joke.

34:23.728 --> 34:30.318
Scott, I am so sorry, okay? This is all--
This is a hundred percent my fault.

34:30.402 --> 34:31.861
I don't care whose fault it is.

34:33.446 --> 34:35.865
I just feel bad right now.

34:43.498 --> 34:46.960
-Well, I guess we should go.
-Yeah, there's nothing more to see here.

34:47.043 --> 34:51.339
No, wait. Look at that.
Uh, Josh gave her flowers?

34:51.423 --> 34:54.259
Wow! That's a big bouquet
of flowers, J. Chan.

34:54.342 --> 34:56.761
The only time he got me flowers
was prom night.

34:56.845 --> 35:00.098
Blue carnations from a gas station,
from a bucket.

35:00.181 --> 35:04.019
In return, I gave him my virginity.
I thought this was a rebound relationship.

35:04.102 --> 35:08.106
No, no, no. It is, it is. He just needs
to get the blonde out of his system.

35:08.189 --> 35:09.566
-Shh, shh, shh! What's he saying?
-Oh.

35:09.649 --> 35:12.068
-Deaf lover, what's he saying?
-[babbling] Okay, okay, okay.

35:12.152 --> 35:16.573
He's saying, "Anna, you are so cool.
I get so stoked when we chill."

35:16.656 --> 35:19.284
Oh, no big deal. He said
stuff like that to me all the time.

35:19.367 --> 35:21.036
He gets stoked
when his mom makes bagel bites.

35:21.119 --> 35:23.622
Um, "I just had to tell you

35:23.705 --> 35:27.584
that I've never felt this way
about anyone else...

35:29.878 --> 35:30.920
...ever."

35:32.589 --> 35:35.008
-"Never ever."
-Okay, I got it.

35:37.594 --> 35:38.928
"Like, ever."

35:49.189 --> 35:51.399
I told you guys, curiosity killed the cat.

35:51.483 --> 35:54.110
Mm. It didn't kill the cat.

35:54.194 --> 35:58.490
It just ripped off the cat's tail,
which has now been reattached.

35:58.573 --> 35:59.866
Mm-hmm.

35:59.949 --> 36:03.244
But I guess you were right. We shouldn't
have gone down the rabbit hole.

36:04.579 --> 36:08.208
The only thing down there
is regret made of rabbit poop.

36:08.291 --> 36:11.961
Well said. Well, I'm just glad
you guys are over it.

36:15.382 --> 36:18.510
-He never loved us.
-No, either of us.

36:18.593 --> 36:23.348
And he's obviously over us,
so he's done and we should be done, too.

36:23.431 --> 36:25.767
-Mm.
-It's time to move on.

36:25.850 --> 36:28.019
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.

36:28.103 --> 36:28.937
Mm.

36:30.939 --> 36:35.777
Oh, yeah. That's good.
Okay, let's see.

36:35.860 --> 36:38.071
Too tall, too hairy.

36:38.154 --> 36:39.531
Too bald.

36:39.614 --> 36:41.741
Ugh, too karate.

36:42.909 --> 36:43.952
That one will do.

36:46.705 --> 36:48.498
Wait, you're-- you're ditching me?

36:48.581 --> 36:50.625
But we were gonna go
binge watch something.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.919
I've been saving <i>Friday Night Lights</i>
for someone special.

36:53.002 --> 36:55.004
I'm sorry, hon. Maybe another time.

36:55.088 --> 36:57.382
And I really do love
all your girl bonding stuff,

36:57.465 --> 37:00.093
but right now, I really need to get laid.

37:05.515 --> 37:08.184
Are you serious?
You've got your jacket? Come on.

37:08.268 --> 37:11.354
-Don't-- Where are you going? Don't leave.
-I'm gonna grab a drink with Hank.

37:11.438 --> 37:13.648
Please just stay and we'll talk this out.

37:13.732 --> 37:15.150
Paula, I need a minute.

37:16.359 --> 37:18.236
I need to cool off.

37:21.114 --> 37:24.117
[door opens, closes]

37:25.535 --> 37:26.619
[sighs]

37:32.375 --> 37:36.671
Hey, Sunil, it's me. What are you--?
Oh, you're busy with the kids.

37:36.755 --> 37:39.924
Just-- Well, I don't know.
Put on a movie or something.

37:41.217 --> 37:45.597
It's fine. No, never mind.
I just-- It was nothing.

37:45.680 --> 37:48.099
Yeah, I'll-- I will talk to you tomorrow.
