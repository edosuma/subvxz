is they now have a king.

to free Emma of the darkness.

14:53.518 --> 14:54.974
Ah, yes, so simple.

14:55.853 --> 14:59.095
You simply need an object
that guides the portal to its destination.

Something that belonged to Emma,
something meaningful to her.

15:04.529 --> 15:05.609

40:02.066 --> 40:03.055
(RUMBUNG)

40:05.486 --> 40:06.896
(ALL GROANING)

40:17.749 --> 40:19.080
What are you guys doing here?

40:20.168 --> 40:21.829
What happened?

40:22.503 --> 40:24.004
We're back.

40:24.505 --> 40:25.836
Bloody hell.

40:25.882 --> 40:28.043
This doesn't make any sense.

40:28.176 --> 40:31.509
We were just walking into Camelot.

40:31.596 --> 40:33.006
What the hell are we wearing?

40:33.056 --> 40:34.762
Sneezy, what happened?
How long were we gone?

40:34.849 --> 40:36.259
Six weeks.

40:36.851 --> 40:37.840
What?

40:37.936 --> 40:41.895
Our memories, they're gone.

40:42.023 --> 40:43.354
Again?

40:46.194 --> 40:48.401
Where's Emma?

40:48.488 --> 40:49.477
DARK SWAN: Relax.

40:51.449 --> 40:53.565
I'm right here.

40:58.581 --> 40:59.866
Mom,

40:59.958 --> 41:01.619
what happened to you?

41:01.709 --> 41:03.700
Isn't it obvious?

41:05.254 --> 41:08.291
You went to Camelot
to get the darkness out of me.

41:10.635 --> 41:11.624
(GASPS)

41:13.304 --> 41:15.636
-And you failed.
-(SNEEZY SNEEZES)

41:18.893 --> 41:20.724
What the hell are you supposed to be?

41:23.398 --> 41:24.387
Ah...

41:28.945 --> 41:31.652
There's no Savior in this town anymore.

41:34.242 --> 41:35.823
Emma, stop. That's enough.

41:36.577 --> 41:37.566
Or what?

41:38.287 --> 41:40.744
Or I'll do exactly what you asked me to.

41:44.419 --> 41:46.501
Looking for this?

41:47.088 --> 41:48.077
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

41:49.632 --> 41:52.749
Nobody's gonna touch this dagger
but me.

41:54.595 --> 41:58.179
And now, for what you all did to me,

42:01.269 --> 42:03.134
you're about to be punished.

42:05.273 --> 42:06.433
Emma,

42:07.859 --> 42:09.440
why are you doing this?

42:12.113 --> 42:13.193
Because

42:14.282 --> 42:15.988
I am the Dark One.
