00:52.956 --> 00:55.834
-Morning, Mr. Clark.
-Morning, Hunter.

01:30.596 --> 01:32.632
-Hi, Carolyn.
-Morning.

01:32.836 --> 01:35.748
Scotty, get the door.
Don't drop the eggs.

01:36.236 --> 01:39.945
-They're for your dad's experiments.
-Okay, Mom.

01:43.836 --> 01:46.350
Calm down, Buddy. It's just me.

01:48.076 --> 01:49.065
Buddy, we're home.

01:52.076 --> 01:54.715
Calm down, Buddy. It's just me.

01:55.276 --> 01:56.391
Buddy!

02:45.556 --> 02:47.786
My beautiful pie.

03:34.556 --> 03:36.114
Bad dog!

03:46.396 --> 03:49.388
Get out, get out, get out!
Out, you animal!

04:51.876 --> 04:54.754
-Control here.
-We've got a serious problem.

05:12.076 --> 05:15.910
My God. Get the best
doggone agent you can in there. Go!

05:33.476 --> 05:38.596
Gentlemen, a few moments ago
I received word of the gravest nature.

05:39.396 --> 05:43.435
A key agent working the Brody case
has been catnapped.

05:45.756 --> 05:50.352
Although he is safe, we must
replace him as soon as possible.

05:50.876 --> 05:54.232
Once again, we find
ourselves threatened...

05:54.436 --> 05:57.109
...by the great cat menace.

06:01.556 --> 06:05.515
We suspect that a rogue feline
is involved in a conspiracy...

06:05.716 --> 06:09.504
... to destroy all we dogs
have worked so hard to achieve.

06:14.596 --> 06:17.633
Therefore, in accordance
with Plan Delta...

06:17.836 --> 06:20.225
... we have an elite team of agents...

06:20.436 --> 06:24.065
... trained to replace
our catnapped comrade.

06:24.396 --> 06:28.025
Right now, replacements
are flying in from London.

06:28.516 --> 06:31.428
One will take his place
as the Brodys ' pet...

06:31.636 --> 06:34.708
...and guard their home
from cat invasion.

06:36.236 --> 06:40.388
I need not remind you that
the future of man and dog alike...

06:40.596 --> 06:43.952
...depends on the success
of this mission.

06:44.156 --> 06:47.626
Failure is not an option.

06:48.116 --> 06:51.426
The stakes are high.
We have everything to lose.

06:51.636 --> 06:55.834
One hundred million dogs
have placed their destiny...

06:56.036 --> 06:58.755
...squarely in our paws.

07:06.636 --> 07:09.548
-I'll bite your ear.
-Get off me!

07:10.116 --> 07:13.108
That's my eye you're poking.

07:13.316 --> 07:17.389
Step aside. Coming through.
Out of the way. Clear the area.

07:17.596 --> 07:19.791
-Not again.
-What is it this time?

07:20.636 --> 07:23.548
I don't think this is a good idea.

07:24.036 --> 07:27.472
-I can't believe this guy.
-When I pull this rope. . .

07:28.636 --> 07:32.072
-What's he doing?
-. . .the sack falls on the pitchfork.

07:32.276 --> 07:35.985
It'll send me out the window
and on the way to freedom!

07:36.196 --> 07:39.905
-What is it with you?
-Me? What's with you?

07:41.636 --> 07:46.073
I want adventure. Not wait
to be taken to some boring house.

07:46.276 --> 07:51.270
-What's wrong with a family loving you?
-Free food, a warm place to sleep.

07:51.476 --> 07:54.946
And you could go to the bathroom
wherever you want.

07:55.476 --> 08:00.231
Don't you want to do something
exciting? Like be a police dog!

08:00.676 --> 08:05.067
Or a Russian space dog!
Or sample the great bones of Europe!

08:05.796 --> 08:07.593
Come on, guys.

08:07.796 --> 08:11.550
Oh, forget it.
See you puppies later.

08:12.436 --> 08:15.746
-Oh, boy, I can't watch.
-This ought to be good.

08:15.956 --> 08:17.469
World, here I come!

08:21.876 --> 08:23.594
Look, he's flying.

08:25.996 --> 08:27.554
No, he's not.

08:28.756 --> 08:32.111
Back from your adventure so soon,
Scooby-Doofus?

08:32.316 --> 08:33.385
Where am l?

08:45.916 --> 08:46.905
What's that?

08:48.756 --> 08:51.475
-Somebody go look.
-You go.

08:55.476 --> 08:57.626
All right! lnto the hole!

08:57.836 --> 09:02.227
Let's move it! Top-secret operation!
lnto the hole! Double-time!

09:02.436 --> 09:05.951
I've seen better hustle
on a dashboard Chihuahua.

09:18.076 --> 09:20.988
Howdy. Over here!

09:22.516 --> 09:25.314
Down, Clucky!
That's one angry chicken.

09:25.516 --> 09:27.427
Front and center, agents!

09:27.636 --> 09:29.627
Go! Let's go, ladies!

09:29.836 --> 09:34.546
Straight line! Ears up! Don't make me
muzzle you! Want a chew toy?

09:34.876 --> 09:37.390
-You wanted excitement?
-Sir, yes, sir!

09:37.596 --> 09:40.394
-You wanted adventure?
-Sir, yes, sir!

09:40.596 --> 09:45.147
If you are chosen, you will be
briefed on arrival. Are you ready?

09:45.396 --> 09:48.115
-Sir, yes, sir!
-Good luck, men.

09:49.476 --> 09:52.752
These are the cutest beagles
you've ever seen.

09:54.076 --> 09:55.065
Over here.

09:55.756 --> 09:59.544
For God's sake,
don't forget to wag those tails!

10:01.076 --> 10:03.749
They sound perfect from what you said.

10:03.956 --> 10:05.230
They're so cute.

10:13.276 --> 10:15.551
They've really changed in size. . .

10:15.996 --> 10:17.224
. . .and color.

10:18.116 --> 10:19.868
And breed.

10:34.396 --> 10:36.864
He is adorable.

10:37.836 --> 10:39.588
Hello!

10:39.796 --> 10:43.425
And you're going to come home with me.

10:47.556 --> 10:49.035
Not good!

10:59.996 --> 11:02.510
Honey? I'll be right there.

11:03.676 --> 11:05.712
Hi, sweetheart.

11:05.996 --> 11:09.193
I have a surprise for you.

11:10.676 --> 11:11.665
A new puppy!

11:12.676 --> 11:15.190
But, Mom, Buddy may still come back.

11:15.956 --> 11:19.073
I'm sorry, hon.
I know it's been a month.

11:19.276 --> 11:22.905
But remember how happy we were
when we found Buddy?

11:23.116 --> 11:27.394
I bet he's making a new family
just as happy right now.

11:29.076 --> 11:32.830
Look at him. And your father
does need him for work.

11:35.556 --> 11:39.390
--catch, you could play Frisbee
and hide-and-seek.

11:39.596 --> 11:41.109
Yes. Perfect.

11:41.516 --> 11:42.995
Let me see.

11:43.236 --> 11:46.626
Oh, yeah, yeah. Let me see.

11:47.436 --> 11:49.506
Dander. Standard composition.

11:50.196 --> 11:52.152
Retinal response. . . .

11:53.516 --> 11:56.110
Normal. Proboscis viscosity. . . .

11:57.156 --> 12:01.627
Not too acid, not too alkaline.
All right, immune response.

12:08.036 --> 12:09.549
That's excellent!

12:09.756 --> 12:10.984
That's good!

12:11.196 --> 12:15.792
Now, a little protein synthesis
and an electrostatic. . . .

12:17.396 --> 12:18.385
So. . . .

12:18.796 --> 12:22.106
I know. Why don't you name him?

12:22.556 --> 12:25.195
Okay. How about "Loser"?

12:26.596 --> 12:27.915
It's a dog, Mom.

12:28.236 --> 12:31.194
You're not a loser, are you?

12:31.436 --> 12:33.347
"No, I'm not a loser. "

12:33.636 --> 12:36.070
Wait. Lou.

12:36.636 --> 12:38.274
We'll call you Lou.

12:38.916 --> 12:40.315
--ser.

12:41.396 --> 12:43.990
No playing in the good living room.

12:44.196 --> 12:48.109
That carpet is Uzbekistani.
Ten thousand thread count.

12:51.836 --> 12:52.825
What?

12:58.036 --> 12:59.355
Loser.

12:59.556 --> 13:00.625
Cat person.

13:02.116 --> 13:03.754
Okay, here's the plan:

13:03.956 --> 13:07.073
Get off this patio,
get back to the barn. . .

13:07.276 --> 13:09.710
. . .get a better pitchfork.

13:19.236 --> 13:20.715
Cool.

13:31.636 --> 13:34.104
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

13:34.756 --> 13:38.385
I like your spirit,
but do me a favor and stand back.

13:38.596 --> 13:39.915
That's my biscuit.

13:42.676 --> 13:45.986
That would've been a short assignment.

13:46.196 --> 13:50.235
-Where you going?
-HQ ain't training how they used to.

13:50.436 --> 13:52.904
-Who exactly are you?
-Name's Butch.

13:53.116 --> 13:57.507
What dumb name did the bipeds
saddle you with? Spot? Fifi? Rover?

13:58.076 --> 13:59.509
-Lou.
-God forbid.

13:59.716 --> 14:02.276
Oh. Lou. Sorry.

14:02.476 --> 14:06.185
Is that boy always grumpy?
They should switch his food.

14:06.436 --> 14:11.351
Humans can get a little emotional.
You'll get used to it. Come on.

14:20.476 --> 14:22.307
Where's that coming from?

14:24.436 --> 14:27.314
-Cool.
-What? It's standard equipment.

14:27.516 --> 14:31.748
Vid-phone, research archive
database, cipher charts, Snausages.

14:31.956 --> 14:33.833
-Hey, what's this?
-Heel!

14:34.076 --> 14:37.751
The big button.
You don't just press the big button.

14:37.956 --> 14:39.230
-Jeez.
-Sorry.

14:39.476 --> 14:42.149
Just try to remember your training.

14:42.876 --> 14:47.313
Let's start. Here's the skinny:
Your new master's a scientist. . .

14:47.516 --> 14:50.235
. . .working on a cure
for dog allergies.

14:50.436 --> 14:55.032
It's big. If no one's allergic
to dogs, we'll have the advantage.

14:55.236 --> 14:59.434
This was your predecessor:
Agent 1 364, AKA Buddy.

14:59.636 --> 15:04.232
He was catnapped. Wasn't on top
of his game, so he had to retire.

15:04.436 --> 15:06.950
He got a condo in Boca. Lucky dog.

15:07.156 --> 15:11.388
You're to replace him and keep
the cats away from the formula.

15:11.596 --> 15:14.554
Can't let them near that.
Now, come on.

15:17.716 --> 15:20.355
All right, agent, let's meet the team.

15:20.556 --> 15:22.911
"Agent" ! Whoa!

15:25.076 --> 15:27.146
Kid, look over there.

15:27.396 --> 15:29.114
-That's Peek.
-Peek?

15:30.076 --> 15:31.191
I don't get it.

15:31.596 --> 15:33.632
Peek, show yourself.

15:37.356 --> 15:41.031
We got a calico on the corner
of Center and Main....

15:41.676 --> 15:42.870
Oh, my God!

15:44.156 --> 15:45.714
Peek's early warning.

15:45.956 --> 15:50.347
He's got it all. Radar, sonar,
thermo-imaging, odor-matrixing. . .

15:50.556 --> 15:54.390
. . .to detect a non-residential cat
from three blocks away.

15:54.596 --> 15:57.156
-Peek, fall in.
-Roger that.

16:02.396 --> 16:05.513
-Sam, what's your 20?
- 1/18 of a klick east.

16:05.716 --> 16:09.425
I'm going to backtrack using
a delta approach in three...

16:09.636 --> 16:11.627
. . .two. . .one.

16:15.236 --> 16:16.225
Hey, guys.

16:17.156 --> 16:18.271
Oh, no, not again.

16:18.756 --> 16:19.950
Where am l?

16:26.436 --> 16:27.630
Over here, Sam.

16:28.636 --> 16:31.753
Request permission
to pant heavily, sir.

16:31.956 --> 16:33.355
Granted.

16:34.756 --> 16:37.793
-Boys, I want you to meet Lou.
-Hey, Louie.

16:37.996 --> 16:39.349
-Hey, Lou.
-Human!

16:49.836 --> 16:52.953
He's taking Buddy's place
in the hot seat.

16:53.156 --> 16:58.355
Being fresh from the academy, he's
current on the new techniques, right?

16:59.596 --> 17:03.555
You know this one?
I got you! Oh, I just missed you.

17:03.916 --> 17:05.508
Holy Chihuahua.

17:05.715 --> 17:08.513
-How did this happen?
-He slipped through.

17:08.715 --> 17:11.594
You promised me a pro! I get a puppy!

17:11.796 --> 17:14.594
He's still got his you-know-whats!

17:14.796 --> 17:18.584
There's no time. He stays.
End of discussion. Out.

17:25.955 --> 17:27.787
So tell me, one of you. . .

17:28.236 --> 17:30.033
. . .is the dog out of the way?

17:32.556 --> 17:35.354
Did the puppy fall for my clever trap?

17:37.156 --> 17:39.875
None of you have a tale to tell?

17:40.076 --> 17:43.546
A little story for me, perhaps?

17:45.076 --> 17:47.909
You! Tell me, is the game afoot?

17:48.116 --> 17:49.344
Yes?

17:49.556 --> 17:52.354
-Why is the game afoot?
-I mean, no.

17:52.556 --> 17:56.674
Excellent. So the puppy is dead.
Now we can move on to--

17:56.876 --> 17:58.025
Wait, wait.

17:58.236 --> 18:01.626
-Can I change my answer?
-Is the puppy alive or not?

18:01.836 --> 18:04.908
Another dog told him it was a bomb.

18:05.116 --> 18:06.788
Another dog?

18:07.036 --> 18:11.985
Anyway, I am sure we'll get into the
basement lab just fine. Right, guys?

18:12.196 --> 18:14.346
-Guys!
-Oh, yeah, absolutely.

18:14.556 --> 18:16.353
-Absolutely.
-See?

18:16.556 --> 18:19.593
Project Dark Cloud will go
without a hitch.

18:19.796 --> 18:22.993
Dark Cloud?
ls that what I'm calling my plan?

18:23.196 --> 18:25.312
No, you're calling it. . . .

18:25.516 --> 18:27.108
-How about Storm?
-Storm.

18:27.316 --> 18:29.113
Dark Storm, yes.

18:29.356 --> 18:34.555
Like a powerful, dark storm, I will
make my presence known to the world.

18:35.276 --> 18:40.111
Like a seeping mist, I will creep
into the dogs' center of power. . .

18:40.356 --> 18:44.588
. . .and make them quake in fear
at the very mention of my name!

18:45.076 --> 18:46.668
Mr. Tinkles!

18:47.516 --> 18:48.835
-Hide!
-Quickly!

18:49.156 --> 18:51.954
-Where are you?
-Quickly!

18:52.676 --> 18:55.509
There you are, Mr. Tinkles.

18:56.116 --> 19:01.315
I've been looking everywhere for you.
Where have you been?

19:01.516 --> 19:04.508
Mr. Mason will be so pleased
to see you.

19:05.196 --> 19:07.232
I'll take you to him.

19:10.036 --> 19:12.266
You're a stinky kitty.

19:12.516 --> 19:14.825
First you have to have a bath.

19:15.756 --> 19:18.748
Mr. Tinkles, remember
to wash behind the ears!

19:20.116 --> 19:25.065
If I'm going to be a secret agent,
I should have a better name.

19:25.596 --> 19:28.508
I was thinking "Total Annihilation. "

19:28.716 --> 19:31.469
He's a pro wrestler.
That name's taken.

19:31.676 --> 19:33.394
Then "Doom Machine" it is.

19:33.596 --> 19:37.555
You call yourself
Squicky the Space Dog for all I care.

19:37.956 --> 19:40.516
That don't make your behind a rocket.

19:40.716 --> 19:44.391
You are not an agent,
but you are going to help us.

19:45.596 --> 19:48.508
So first things first.
Kid, pay attention.

19:48.716 --> 19:49.865
History 1 01 :

19:50.116 --> 19:54.075
We have always been man's best
friend. Even you know that.

19:54.276 --> 19:56.506
But cats, they're another story.

19:56.716 --> 20:00.948
-Start with ancient Egypt.
-We've seen that 5 billion times.

20:01.156 --> 20:03.431
Never mind. Sorry. Here goes.

20:05.356 --> 20:07.074
Ancient Egypt.

20:08.476 --> 20:10.228
See these hieroglyphics?

20:10.436 --> 20:13.985
Humans think it says
ancient people worshiped cats.

20:14.196 --> 20:16.949
But in reality,
they were ruled by them.

20:17.156 --> 20:21.866
An evil cat named Shen-Akh-Akumon made
them build pyramids, monuments.

20:22.076 --> 20:25.227
He treated them like they
were his litter box.

20:25.436 --> 20:28.667
-Things were terrible.
-This is the best part.

20:28.876 --> 20:32.835
So the dogs,
being man 's best friend, rose up.

20:34.596 --> 20:37.110
And put them down.

20:38.116 --> 20:42.632
With humans back on top, we took
our natural place at their side.

20:43.076 --> 20:44.794
The people just forgot?

20:44.996 --> 20:50.195
Remember, they're a primitive species.
Can't sense earthquakes, smell fear.

20:50.476 --> 20:54.264
They can't even take
responsibility for their own farts.

20:55.356 --> 20:56.948
Gross.

20:57.156 --> 20:58.350
Guilty.

20:58.556 --> 20:59.875
I'll get the fence.

21:00.156 --> 21:02.716
That's how our outfit got started.

21:02.916 --> 21:07.387
Sometimes a cat gets too big
for his coat and tries to take over.

21:07.596 --> 21:11.350
We must keep cats from the lab
till the formula's done.

21:11.556 --> 21:12.545
Yes, sir!

21:12.756 --> 21:15.509
-Anything weird, call us.
-Yes, sir!

21:15.716 --> 21:17.707
-Any questions?
-Just one, sir.

21:17.916 --> 21:19.986
-Shoot.
-What's ancient Egypt?

21:22.236 --> 21:23.715
Freeze, cat.

21:23.916 --> 21:25.031
I'm an agent.

21:25.356 --> 21:27.950
I'm so fast, I can't see myself.

21:28.156 --> 21:30.545
Agent Doom Machine. You see that?

21:30.756 --> 21:33.509
Watch out, cat.
I couldn't even see it.

21:33.716 --> 21:35.991
There's a good puppy. Hello!

21:36.196 --> 21:38.664
Don't get scared. Don't get scared.

21:38.876 --> 21:42.186
Look how good you're being.
Look how good--

21:42.396 --> 21:46.435
Where's that--? There. I got it.
This won't hurt a bit.

21:51.196 --> 21:53.835
Let's see. Let's see.

22:00.196 --> 22:01.948
Hey, that's good.

22:09.996 --> 22:11.475
-Hey, Dad!
-Boils.

22:11.676 --> 22:13.951
Want to help me practice?

22:40.716 --> 22:43.025
I forgot your bow.

22:44.476 --> 22:46.865
Your pretty bow.

22:47.956 --> 22:51.232
When I rule the Earth,
you will be the first. . .

22:51.436 --> 22:53.028
. . .on my list.

22:53.356 --> 22:55.631
Keep the hairdo. It's slimming.

22:55.876 --> 22:59.346
-There's room on that list for you.
-No, I mean it.

23:00.796 --> 23:02.548
We only have a few days.

23:02.756 --> 23:07.386
Although playing pet for that old man
upstairs is key to my scheme. . .

23:07.596 --> 23:11.714
. . .I cannot stand this humiliation
any longer. Am I clear?

23:13.076 --> 23:17.866
Never mind. The puppy won't survive
the night. Send in the ninjas.

23:23.756 --> 23:27.305
-Nervous about the tryouts tomorrow?
-No.

23:27.596 --> 23:30.872
-It's okay to be nervous.
-I'm not nervous.

23:31.116 --> 23:33.676
I stink, but I'm not nervous.

23:33.876 --> 23:38.586
Is he saying that because
he needs me to reassure him?

23:39.516 --> 23:41.711
Yes. Reassure him.

23:42.156 --> 23:46.752
You're the most wonderful,
bright, charming, good-looking. . .

23:47.836 --> 23:50.430
. . .boy in the whole wide world.

23:51.876 --> 23:56.188
-Maybe your dad could help you.
-I'm pretty sure he stinks too.

23:56.596 --> 23:58.473
I'm gonna talk to him.

23:59.916 --> 24:03.352
-Time for bed. TV off. Five minutes.
-Seven.

24:03.556 --> 24:04.545
-Six.
-Deal.

24:04.756 --> 24:07.065
-Love you.
-I love you too.

24:07.476 --> 24:09.114
Well? Hand it over.

24:09.356 --> 24:12.189
What?! No gravy?

24:14.636 --> 24:16.831
Next time remember the gravy.

24:17.636 --> 24:18.625
Dogs rule.

24:19.916 --> 24:22.111
Going someplace?

24:22.476 --> 24:24.990
Now, let's see.

24:25.196 --> 24:29.269
Ooh, yeah. 1409 Maple Terrace.

24:29.596 --> 24:31.075
I got him.

24:31.436 --> 24:35.224
Total covert operation.
Got to be like a Stealth.

24:49.796 --> 24:50.990
Hey, Sam.

25:01.156 --> 25:04.432
On my mark. Three, two, one.

25:04.636 --> 25:06.786
Banzai!

25:07.996 --> 25:10.556
Dogs must die!

25:14.956 --> 25:16.025
Lou, it's Peek.

25:16.236 --> 25:18.067
Are you there? It's Peek.

25:18.956 --> 25:20.833
-Lou!
-What? What? Where?

25:21.036 --> 25:26.235
I'm picking up a faint signal. Maybe
it's a glitch. You better check it.

25:26.636 --> 25:28.194
Okay. I'll go look.

25:28.516 --> 25:30.074
Be careful, kid.

25:30.876 --> 25:32.275
I'm an agent.

25:32.796 --> 25:34.468
I'm a secret agent.

25:35.196 --> 25:37.505
I'm a one-dog army.

26:01.596 --> 26:03.268
Turn over.

26:11.076 --> 26:12.953
Bug activated.

26:22.956 --> 26:25.914
Peek? Hello? Peek?

26:26.476 --> 26:27.511
Seems clear.

26:27.716 --> 26:30.947
Probablyjust a squirrel.
I'll let Butch know.

26:31.756 --> 26:32.871
Behind you!

26:34.796 --> 26:35.785
Sorry!

26:39.636 --> 26:41.433
-What do I do?
-Bite them.

27:02.156 --> 27:03.145
What?

27:15.076 --> 27:16.475
Just do as I say.

27:16.676 --> 27:19.144
Left! Right paw! Again!

27:20.796 --> 27:21.945
Roll over!

27:22.716 --> 27:24.946
That's a good doggy. Paws up!

27:25.796 --> 27:26.990
Donkey kick!

27:27.276 --> 27:30.109
Come on, kid, give them the haymaker!

27:37.356 --> 27:40.951
I changed my mind.
Call me the Claw of Ling Chow!

27:41.156 --> 27:42.748
Ling Chow this!

27:45.236 --> 27:47.033
Clean up on aisle 7.

27:47.236 --> 27:49.750
-Humans!
-Retreat with honor.

27:49.956 --> 27:51.435
I have a bat.

27:51.836 --> 27:54.953
I have a mitt,
and I'm not afraid to use it.

28:07.076 --> 28:08.509
Bad dog.

28:14.756 --> 28:16.792
You're lucky you're so cute.

28:27.396 --> 28:29.148
-Doom Machine.
-Hey, guys.

28:29.356 --> 28:33.144
-You're still alive.
-Yep. All five limbs.

28:33.356 --> 28:35.870
You owe me five smoked pig ears.

28:36.076 --> 28:38.465
You're still standing. You okay?

28:38.676 --> 28:41.986
Did you see me?
Right, left and right and left--

28:42.196 --> 28:45.506
You got cocky.
You think this is a game?

28:45.716 --> 28:48.947
This isn't about code names,
boys or friends.

28:49.156 --> 28:52.353
It's about guarding that lab.
Nothing else.

28:53.036 --> 28:54.992
Sam, Peek, seal the chimney.

28:55.196 --> 28:57.551
-Right, boss.
-You got it, skip.

29:14.996 --> 29:16.395
Cats.

29:18.516 --> 29:20.393
Don't they ever quit?

29:32.156 --> 29:34.351
Can I show you something?

29:39.396 --> 29:41.626
The Brodys have the best garbage.

29:41.836 --> 29:43.827
-Go on. Take a bite.
-Oh, my.

29:44.036 --> 29:47.426
This is what they get to eat?
What a gyp.

29:47.636 --> 29:49.433
I'm glad you liked it.

29:49.636 --> 29:53.231
-I thought I was a stray too long.
-Stray? Cool.

29:53.436 --> 29:58.112
-I've never met a stray.
-I prefer "domestically challenged. "

29:58.316 --> 30:01.274
Miss Challenged, sorry,
but you gotta leave.

30:01.476 --> 30:04.036
-My orders are clear. I can't--
-Orders?

30:04.236 --> 30:07.626
-That's right. I'm a secret agent.
-An agent?

30:07.836 --> 30:11.590
You're small for an agent.
Shouldn't you be having fun?

30:11.796 --> 30:13.275
I don't have time.

30:14.796 --> 30:16.673
Tough guy.

30:19.716 --> 30:22.230
Stop with the agent stuff. Okay?

30:22.836 --> 30:27.626
You have your own kid to play with.
Don't take it for granted.

30:31.316 --> 30:34.547
Where you going?
Could you do that again?

30:34.756 --> 30:39.147
Next time he talks to you,
tilt your head and perk your ears.

30:39.356 --> 30:42.393
You'll see what I'm talking about.

30:42.596 --> 30:46.589
And do me a favor.
Tell Butch lvy's back in town.

30:54.996 --> 30:56.987
What are you looking at?

30:58.476 --> 31:01.752
Well, I guess you're kind of cute.

31:04.476 --> 31:06.865
Look who it is. I got you.

31:09.476 --> 31:13.105
Last night your mother and I
had a conversation. . .

31:13.356 --> 31:15.426
. . .that made me think that maybe. . .

31:15.636 --> 31:17.786
. . .you and I should talk. . .

31:17.996 --> 31:20.635
. . .about you and me
and my big project.

31:20.836 --> 31:22.747
You want to sit down?

31:24.076 --> 31:25.634
Oh, yeah. Sure, sure.

31:27.196 --> 31:29.266
Your mom made me think that. . . .

31:29.956 --> 31:33.949
Well, I'm coming to your
soccer tryout this afternoon.

31:34.156 --> 31:35.669
You don't have to.

31:35.876 --> 31:36.865
But. . . .

31:38.676 --> 31:40.712
-Here I come.
-Really?

31:43.876 --> 31:46.185
-Oh, good. Cool. Cool.
-Cool.

31:46.476 --> 31:49.354
You don't want to be late for school.

31:50.396 --> 31:51.795
Yeah, I am.

31:52.356 --> 31:54.392
-See you, Dad.
-See you.

31:54.596 --> 31:58.191
Go, go, go! I'll be cheering for you!

31:58.436 --> 32:03.226
Our team is red-hot
Your team ain 't doodly-squat

32:16.916 --> 32:19.225
I stunk. Worse than stunk.

32:19.436 --> 32:23.190
Scotty? Have you seen
this little-- Tryouts!

32:27.876 --> 32:29.912
Wow. He really does stink.

32:31.476 --> 32:35.435
Guess it didn't go so well, huh?
What did the coach say?

32:37.196 --> 32:40.745
He said tryouts for
the girls' team are on Monday.

32:42.716 --> 32:44.946
What about your father?

33:00.236 --> 33:02.033
-Soccer.
-I'm in the middle--

33:02.236 --> 33:05.194
-Soccer.
-No, thank you. I must get--

33:05.396 --> 33:06.670
Soccer.

33:08.956 --> 33:12.312
-I forgot. I had a breakthrough--
-I know you're busy. . . .

33:12.516 --> 33:14.108
He is your son.

33:14.636 --> 33:17.548
I was in the middle--
I had a breakthrough.

33:19.876 --> 33:22.834
I know. I know. I'm sorry.

33:54.636 --> 33:56.547
Good boy.

33:56.756 --> 34:00.351
-A beautiful sight.
-You said we wouldn't talk again.

34:00.556 --> 34:03.514
-Now I have a reason.
-Spare me the lecture.

34:04.156 --> 34:07.990
He's a puppy. He doesn't
know what he's getting into.

34:08.196 --> 34:12.587
Forgive me for not teaching him
the finer points of scratching.

34:12.795 --> 34:14.592
Now, I have a job to do.

34:14.835 --> 34:18.670
You never complained
when your belly was scratched.

34:19.235 --> 34:21.625
Under the moon? Before a mission?

34:21.835 --> 34:24.475
You'd call me Lamb Chop and blush. . .

34:24.676 --> 34:27.143
. . .whenever I called you Liver Snap.

34:28.996 --> 34:30.793
Bringing up history...

34:30.996 --> 34:34.466
. . .is barking up the wrong tree.
I'll say this once:

34:34.676 --> 34:37.634
Stay away from the kid.

34:40.156 --> 34:43.466
Mr. Mason, I have someone to see you.

34:44.476 --> 34:47.672
It's Mr. Tinkles time, Mr. Mason.

34:50.196 --> 34:53.905
Tonight, he's wearing something
very special for you.

34:54.116 --> 34:55.549
There.

34:55.795 --> 35:00.916
Does that make you happy, Mr. Mason?
Are you happy now?

35:14.276 --> 35:18.633
See how happy you make him?
You make his heart go "boop. "

35:18.836 --> 35:21.589
I leave you two young things together.

35:26.396 --> 35:29.354
Evil does not wear a bonnet!

35:30.756 --> 35:32.553
Coming out. Is she gone?

35:32.756 --> 35:36.795
Did Genghis Khan wear a bonnet?
Attila the Hun? No.

35:36.996 --> 35:39.874
He wore a furry hat.
Maybe a black bonnet?

35:41.836 --> 35:44.908
The ninjas failed.
Failure is unacceptable.

35:45.396 --> 35:48.593
If they show their faces,
you know what to do.

35:48.796 --> 35:52.391
Tell them to wash with
a loofah sponge. Kidding.

35:52.596 --> 35:56.066
This can't be happening.
I want them eliminated!

35:56.276 --> 35:58.312
But they did bug the phone.

35:58.516 --> 36:01.952
Maybe we can look at the glass
as half-full.

36:02.956 --> 36:04.674
That's what I like to do.

36:04.876 --> 36:08.789
Putting a happy face on things.
Interesting philosophy.

36:09.076 --> 36:12.785
Did you forget we're
trying to take over the world?!

36:12.996 --> 36:16.750
The clock is ticking.
We've a small margin for error.

36:16.956 --> 36:20.585
Tomorrow, you will send in
the Russian.

36:23.756 --> 36:25.189
I'll call you back.

36:35.276 --> 36:40.396
Last night, a disturbance occurred
at a top-secret allergy research lab.

36:41.396 --> 36:42.909
Bogey in the wire.

36:43.116 --> 36:44.515
-You got him?
-No.

36:44.716 --> 36:47.947
-Closing fast.
-I can't see. There's a fog.

36:48.396 --> 36:50.785
It's your hair, Sam. Blow up.

36:51.876 --> 36:54.470
Hold on. Mom's back.

36:56.436 --> 36:57.835
Oh, no.

36:58.036 --> 36:59.833
Look at the little kitty.

37:00.036 --> 37:03.028
Look at the kitty. Oh, yeah.

37:03.236 --> 37:07.752
That's a good boy.
He's just a poor little lost kitty.

37:07.956 --> 37:11.505
And we're going to keep him.
Yes, we are.

37:11.716 --> 37:13.627
Don't eat her.

37:16.476 --> 37:18.831
Oh, look. See?

37:19.036 --> 37:23.507
Look how much she likes you.
Dave, I've run into a bit of a snag.

37:23.716 --> 37:27.425
You'll have to show the house
without me. Oh, hang on.

37:29.076 --> 37:32.432
What is that? ls that a hairball?

37:32.636 --> 37:36.709
I'll get you some water.
Not you, Dave. I'll be there soon.

37:37.396 --> 37:38.670
Hang on.

37:41.036 --> 37:43.391
I'm on to you. You're in trouble.

37:43.596 --> 37:47.350
I think not, baby puppy.
It is you who is in trouble.

37:49.516 --> 37:51.234
Yuck!

37:55.556 --> 37:57.706
From Russia with love.

37:58.076 --> 37:59.589
Stealth poop.

38:03.516 --> 38:05.632
I don't have time for this.

38:06.156 --> 38:07.305
Bad dog.

38:08.676 --> 38:09.870
What do we got?

38:10.076 --> 38:13.034
-A Russian Blue.
-And a number 2 in sector 3.

38:13.236 --> 38:15.796
That steamer was bigger than me.

38:15.996 --> 38:18.112
Nice work. Sit this one out.

38:18.356 --> 38:20.745
-Is she gone?
-I don't see her.

38:20.956 --> 38:23.470
But I was framed! That cat--
Wait up.

38:23.956 --> 38:26.709
-Look out. Code 4.
-Quick, smell my butt.

38:27.916 --> 38:29.827
All right, break it up.

38:30.876 --> 38:31.991
-Cold nose!
-Go!

38:36.436 --> 38:38.427
Piece of junk American door.

38:43.796 --> 38:47.675
I cannot believe I do this job
for half price.

38:47.876 --> 38:52.586
And this Tinkles, he is jerk.
He talk too much and shed all over.

38:54.596 --> 38:57.713
-West-east.
-On her way to the corner.

38:57.916 --> 39:00.032
-And she's out.
-And she's out.

39:06.916 --> 39:08.793
Oh, man, it's locked.

39:11.156 --> 39:15.069
What do they know? I work hard,
bring home the Meow Mix.

39:16.076 --> 39:17.065
Boom-boom!

39:17.276 --> 39:18.755
-What's he doing?
-Kid!

39:18.956 --> 39:20.105
What? Dogs!

39:24.396 --> 39:25.590
Take this!

39:28.636 --> 39:29.910
Missed.

39:31.756 --> 39:34.350
Run! Come on, kid. Hurry!

39:41.476 --> 39:43.944
Watch it, fellas! He's coming in!

39:49.756 --> 39:52.953
-There's a bomb at the lab door.
-We're on it.

39:53.396 --> 39:56.069
Doggies, why not come out and play?

39:56.276 --> 39:58.028
-Guys!
-Come on, man!

39:58.236 --> 40:01.546
-The bomb. The bomb!
-Kid, I'm going for the bomb.

40:01.836 --> 40:03.792
Come on! Hurry! The bomb!

40:06.396 --> 40:08.273
-You distract him.
-Why me?

40:08.476 --> 40:11.070
-You wanted to help.
-Come on! Come on!

40:12.156 --> 40:14.750
-Stupid cat!
-That'll get his attention.

40:32.156 --> 40:34.147
The dresser's coming down.

40:37.156 --> 40:40.865
-The bomb. You got 45 seconds.
-I said we're on it.

40:42.436 --> 40:44.267
You need anger management.

40:45.956 --> 40:47.105
Boomerang!

40:52.956 --> 40:54.469
Look out, kid!

40:56.676 --> 40:58.234
Nice catch.

41:02.796 --> 41:04.070
Human!

41:18.636 --> 41:19.625
Phone.

41:39.156 --> 41:40.635
Hang on, Butch!

41:40.836 --> 41:41.905
Hey, puppy, fetch.

41:42.636 --> 41:43.830
No! Wait!

41:44.036 --> 41:45.355
All right!

41:50.276 --> 41:52.312
A flying dog.

41:55.756 --> 41:56.905
Hold on, kid.

41:57.116 --> 41:58.515
Hurry! The bomb!

41:58.716 --> 42:00.707
-Get off me, furball!
-Fight!

42:00.996 --> 42:03.305
Take him. I'll go for the bomb.

42:03.516 --> 42:04.551
Ten seconds.

42:04.956 --> 42:06.594
You fight like a poodle.

42:06.836 --> 42:11.068
-The book says cut the red wire.
-We're dogs. We're colorblind!

42:11.276 --> 42:13.790
Right. The dark gray one! Oh, no.

42:13.996 --> 42:15.509
Don't touch it!

42:15.716 --> 42:17.707
-Come on.
-Please!

42:18.036 --> 42:19.708
That's the one!

42:27.316 --> 42:30.592
You think you have won?
Remote detonator!

42:33.716 --> 42:35.832
Hello, dog-- Oh, good.

42:36.036 --> 42:37.754
Come here, Lou.

42:37.956 --> 42:41.312
-Nice outfit.
-Come here.

42:41.516 --> 42:43.074
Ouch!

42:43.596 --> 42:44.915
Hang on. Good dog.

42:49.996 --> 42:53.386
Bulbous. It's a breakthrough.
If I can only find. . .

42:53.596 --> 42:57.908
. . .a little protein synthesis
and an electrostatic charge. . .

42:58.116 --> 43:00.027
. . .it'll sustain the compound. . . .

43:01.596 --> 43:05.874
Good job with the boomerang.
You're acting like an agent.

43:06.076 --> 43:09.512
-Was that a compliment?
-He never compliments me.

43:10.836 --> 43:13.475
Sam, Peek, call in a clean-up crew.

43:16.396 --> 43:20.992
Hello? Here, kitty, kitty.

43:21.676 --> 43:24.031
Here, little kitty, kitty.

43:24.476 --> 43:28.185
I have a treat for you.
Here, kitty, kitty--

43:30.756 --> 43:32.508
Oh, my God.

43:32.716 --> 43:35.594
Who left the window open?

43:39.916 --> 43:40.951
Here, kitty.

43:41.156 --> 43:43.624
I will tell you nothing!

43:45.036 --> 43:47.027
I may look cute and cuddly. . .

43:47.236 --> 43:49.955
. . .but inside, granite!

43:50.396 --> 43:53.035
We can 't get anything else out of him.

43:53.236 --> 43:57.149
We pumped a few things from
his stomach. Pretty standard:

43:57.356 --> 44:00.951
Grenade, pick, dynamite,
squeaky mouse and this.

44:01.156 --> 44:04.626
"This is where you are
to enact my fiendish plan.

44:04.836 --> 44:08.306
Eat this after you read it
so no one will find it. "

44:08.516 --> 44:10.825
Look here. A Christmas tree.

44:11.596 --> 44:15.111
Research is trying to place it.
Ring any bells?

44:17.756 --> 44:18.825
What's next?

44:19.036 --> 44:22.346
You heard her, boys.
Focus on the mission.

44:22.676 --> 44:25.952
-Full spread scans every 20 minutes.
-Roger that.

44:26.156 --> 44:28.954
-Sam, trim your bangs.
-Sorry.

44:29.156 --> 44:33.547
Kid, keep up the good work.
Remember to stay away from the boy.

44:33.756 --> 44:35.474
Keep your eye on the ball.

44:40.196 --> 44:42.505
Come on, bring me the ball.

44:42.716 --> 44:44.354
Come on over here.

44:44.556 --> 44:45.909
Come on, Lou.

44:59.036 --> 45:02.949
I have the ball now!
You can't get it from me!

45:21.596 --> 45:24.235
How do you always find me? Tell me.

45:24.436 --> 45:25.585
Let's hear it.

45:27.196 --> 45:29.152
Belly rub!

45:34.276 --> 45:38.554
I'll race you across the yard!
What's the matter? Too slow?

45:38.756 --> 45:42.510
Come on! You can't catch me!
Try and get it.

46:33.956 --> 46:36.106
Negative. Non-reactive.

46:36.716 --> 46:39.674
Serum sample 1-5-4-3...

46:40.396 --> 46:42.273
...negative. Non-reactive.

46:42.476 --> 46:43.465
My work.

46:43.676 --> 46:48.067
It was an accident. I was playing
with the dog-- The door was open!

46:48.276 --> 46:50.471
Then I was just playing. . . .

46:50.676 --> 46:52.746
I didn't mean to.

46:52.956 --> 46:56.551
-I'm so sorry.
-You should just go to school.

46:56.796 --> 47:00.835
Sample 1-5-4-6, negative.
Non-reactive.

47:01.036 --> 47:02.549
Butch will kill me.

47:02.756 --> 47:07.272
1-5-4-7, negative. Non-reactive.

47:08.076 --> 47:10.909
Serum sample 1-5-4-8...

47:11.796 --> 47:14.356
...negative. Non-reactive.

47:14.556 --> 47:18.265
Serum sample 1-5-4-9...

47:18.516 --> 47:21.553
...positive. Pro-reactive.

47:22.116 --> 47:26.826
Molecular structure resolved.
Allergy formula complete.

47:45.636 --> 47:46.989
I did it.

47:47.796 --> 47:49.024
We did it.

47:49.236 --> 47:50.874
We did it.

47:54.996 --> 47:58.625
Doctor, the cure for dog allergies?
Success. Done.

47:58.836 --> 48:01.828
Fantastic. Send it
and we'll verify it.

48:02.036 --> 48:06.075
-Tomorrow morning, then. Bless you.
-Unacceptable.

48:06.276 --> 48:09.586
We must act now
or the work will be out of reach.

48:09.796 --> 48:12.788
-Do you know what that means?
-Oh, who? Me?

48:12.996 --> 48:15.112
Weren't you paying attention?

48:15.356 --> 48:18.029
-Not really. Are you mad?
-Yes! I am mad!

48:18.236 --> 48:21.069
-You bug of an imbecile--
-Mr. Tinkles!

48:24.436 --> 48:27.155
Guess what I made for you!

48:32.516 --> 48:35.349
Now you can look just like me.

48:35.596 --> 48:39.748
No, I think not, Sophie.
Those days are through.

48:40.636 --> 48:44.834
What's the matter, Large Marge?
Cat got your tongue?

48:45.036 --> 48:46.025
Boo!

48:46.836 --> 48:48.792
Oh, my! A talking cat?

48:48.996 --> 48:50.145
Scary, isn't it?

48:54.636 --> 48:59.391
Lock her in the closet. We must remain
on schedule. Our day has come!

49:06.796 --> 49:07.785
Brake!

49:11.836 --> 49:12.825
Gas!

49:14.516 --> 49:16.108
Brake!

49:18.956 --> 49:22.073
-Are we gonna get away with this?
-Watch me.

49:27.156 --> 49:29.624
Mr. Mason. What a surprise, sir.

49:29.836 --> 49:33.624
Good morning, human guard.
Let us in. That is all.

49:34.156 --> 49:35.225
Of course, sir.

49:35.436 --> 49:37.472
Gas it up! Step on it.

49:37.796 --> 49:39.388
Get off the brake!

49:46.196 --> 49:47.390
Brake!

49:48.596 --> 49:50.154
Brake! Hit the brake!

49:51.076 --> 49:52.270
Gas!

49:52.476 --> 49:53.989
Get out of the road!

49:54.196 --> 49:55.675
Brake!

49:55.876 --> 49:59.266
-Gas!
-What are you doing up there?

49:59.476 --> 50:03.594
Can't you drive, you imbecile?
Don't make me come up there--

50:03.796 --> 50:05.514
Where'd you get licensed?

50:07.236 --> 50:09.147
Hello. Out of my way.

50:11.116 --> 50:12.708
Attention, employees.

50:12.916 --> 50:16.625
Work quickly.
Only seven months until Christmas.

50:16.836 --> 50:19.191
-Mr. Mason!
-Move. Back to work.

50:19.396 --> 50:20.875
-Sir.
-Get a life.

50:21.076 --> 50:24.466
-Out of my way. No lunch for you.
-Mr. Mason!

50:24.676 --> 50:26.268
-Morning, sir.
-Nice hat.

50:26.476 --> 50:29.434
-How are you feeling?
-None of your business.

50:29.636 --> 50:33.868
Yes, that's me. Not an evil cat
bent on taking over the world.

50:34.076 --> 50:35.509
Out of my way.

50:36.876 --> 50:39.515
Factory employees, congratulations.

50:39.716 --> 50:43.709
This factory has been
accident-free for 45 minutes.

50:54.116 --> 50:56.152
Sir! Mr. Mason.

50:58.076 --> 50:59.350
-Sir.
-Get the door.

51:04.436 --> 51:06.313
Nice dress.

51:09.076 --> 51:13.547
-Can I get you anything?
-Sushi and cream. Close the door.

51:16.036 --> 51:17.515
Attention--

51:18.596 --> 51:20.507
Attention, human worker.

51:20.716 --> 51:23.674
This is your employer, Mr. Mason.

51:23.876 --> 51:26.948
Effective immediately,
you are all fired.

51:27.156 --> 51:28.987
That's right. Fired!

51:29.236 --> 51:33.832
Go home now. Do not ask why.
You have only yourself to blame.

51:34.036 --> 51:37.346
Unless you have a dog.
Then blame him.

51:37.596 --> 51:41.430
In fact, kick him when you get home.
That is all.

51:43.556 --> 51:44.705
Cats rule.

51:44.916 --> 51:47.146
Now, the next phase of my plan.

51:56.196 --> 51:57.834
Scotty?

51:58.036 --> 52:00.027
I have a package for you.

52:04.836 --> 52:08.431
Wait. Where'd she go?
ln or out? ln or out?

52:08.636 --> 52:10.274
Honey, honey.

52:11.556 --> 52:14.514
You'll never believe this.
A breakthrough.

52:14.836 --> 52:17.430
I am just hours away from--

52:18.276 --> 52:23.350
Mom, Dad! Check it out!
I won free tickets to a game tonight.

52:24.276 --> 52:26.153
-What?
-That is so great.

52:26.356 --> 52:30.235
-Uruguay versus Chad.
-You never entered a contest.

52:30.476 --> 52:32.831
Can we go? Please, can we go?

52:35.236 --> 52:36.351
Me?

52:38.396 --> 52:41.229
Please, I really want to go. Come on.

52:44.276 --> 52:47.188
Hurry, buckle up!
We don't want to be late!

52:50.956 --> 52:53.754
-The birds have left the nest.
-Go again.

52:53.956 --> 52:56.311
The jelly is out of the donut.

52:56.516 --> 52:59.747
-What are you saying?
-The family has gone.

53:00.396 --> 53:01.954
Hey, Lou.

53:03.556 --> 53:06.024
It's you. Where have you been?

53:06.236 --> 53:07.351
Around.

53:07.556 --> 53:12.186
This week's been amazing. I beat up
a kitten, I'm on wet food. . . .

53:12.836 --> 53:16.192
-. . .and Scott says I'm his best friend.
-Terrific.

53:16.396 --> 53:21.231
Don't tell anyone. Butch won't
like it. He gets mad about that stuff.

53:21.436 --> 53:24.109
Yeah, I know. But he's not mad.

53:24.356 --> 53:27.154
Sometimes mad is a way of hiding. . .

53:27.556 --> 53:31.231
-. . .how sad you are.
-What? Why would he be sad?

53:33.636 --> 53:37.948
It's not my place to say.
But a person really hurt him once.

53:39.276 --> 53:41.551
Poor Butch.

53:44.916 --> 53:47.635
Here we are. I said I'd get us here.

53:47.836 --> 53:51.829
I hope Mbuto plays.
He's the best one-legged forward ever.

53:52.036 --> 53:56.075
-Is this the right place?
-Where are all the tailgaters?

53:56.276 --> 53:58.915
Dad, it's an exhibition game.

53:59.116 --> 54:01.471
Are we early? Nobody around.

54:01.676 --> 54:04.827
That'll make us first in line
for chili dogs.

54:05.036 --> 54:06.025
Oh, goody!

54:06.276 --> 54:08.665
Chili dog! Chili dog!

54:08.876 --> 54:11.549
How much do I owe?
I'm sorry. Didn't catch it.

54:14.744 --> 54:16.700
-Hello.
-No charge for you!

54:18.544 --> 54:19.943
-What?
-What is it?

54:20.144 --> 54:22.294
-Oh, my God!
-Take it back.

54:40.584 --> 54:42.779
Cats rule, cats rule

54:44.504 --> 54:45.857
Yeah, we kick butt

54:55.384 --> 54:56.499
Kid.

54:57.064 --> 54:58.179
Lou!

54:59.544 --> 55:00.772
Butch.

55:01.064 --> 55:02.179
What's up?

55:02.864 --> 55:06.015
Professor's done,
I filed my report and. . . .

55:06.904 --> 55:07.973
Kid. . .

55:08.464 --> 55:13.254
. . .they're impressed with you.
They wanted me to give you this.

55:17.224 --> 55:18.623
But this is for. . . .

55:18.824 --> 55:22.214
When this job ends,
you've a spot at the academy.

55:22.424 --> 55:24.813
You pulled it off. Good work.

55:25.024 --> 55:28.903
-I get to be a real agent like you?
-Well, you can try.

55:29.104 --> 55:31.618
-Partners!
-Don't wet the paper yet.

55:31.824 --> 55:36.181
But if you make it,
think of all the places you'll see.

55:36.384 --> 55:38.500
Maybe Burma.

55:39.544 --> 55:41.774
Or Denmark. What was her name?

55:42.584 --> 55:44.142
Or Pasadena.

55:44.984 --> 55:48.135
Wait. So I wouldn't stay here.

55:48.344 --> 55:50.574
You go where they need you.

55:52.304 --> 55:53.862
Bogey in the wire.

55:54.064 --> 55:55.053
-Where?
-47-B.

55:55.264 --> 55:59.974
-It's a calico. Should I take him?
-Negative. Me and the kid got it.

56:01.424 --> 56:05.815
This is my last job. Deliver this
tape, and I'm off to Jamaica.

56:14.864 --> 56:16.820
-What's this?
-Get off me.

56:17.024 --> 56:19.060
All right, you got me.

56:19.264 --> 56:22.222
Stop. Please don't pull
on the duct tape!

56:23.184 --> 56:27.894
Is this on? Closer! Turn the
camera over! Where did you come from?

56:28.104 --> 56:31.540
Hello, my puny-minded
dog-faced opponents.

56:31.744 --> 56:35.532
What? Yes, it's on.
Because the red light's blinking.

56:35.744 --> 56:36.779
Start over.

56:36.984 --> 56:40.818
Hello, my puny-minded
dog-faced opponents.

56:41.024 --> 56:43.015
I'm sure you've wondered...

56:43.224 --> 56:46.739
...about the identity of who it is
that'll defeat you.

56:46.944 --> 56:50.095
Who it is that possesses
the intellect to win...

56:50.304 --> 56:53.341
...in this chess game
of wits and might.

56:53.544 --> 56:54.943
It is l!

56:55.824 --> 56:57.621
Recognize these humans?

56:58.264 --> 57:01.176
If you want to see them alive again...

57:01.384 --> 57:03.978
...bring the formula and all notes...

57:04.184 --> 57:09.133
...regarding Mr. Brody's research
to the 9th Street Pier at midnight.

57:09.344 --> 57:13.337
If you refuse, well,
they will be put to sleep!

57:15.504 --> 57:16.903
Still the camera!

57:17.104 --> 57:19.493
You have until midnight to comply.

57:21.024 --> 57:24.858
-We're gonna save them, right?
-This is over our heads.

57:32.104 --> 57:35.733
-You calling headquarters?
-No, we're going there.

57:35.944 --> 57:39.300
Now, we can push the big button.
Hang on!

57:40.664 --> 57:42.063
-Nav systems.
-Check.

57:43.304 --> 57:44.737
-GPS.
-Check.

57:44.944 --> 57:47.617
Raising anchors. We're go for launch.

57:47.824 --> 57:50.019
Hold onto your tail, kid!

57:56.904 --> 57:59.259
Velocity at 625 feet per second.

58:00.104 --> 58:02.664
You are clear for EVA.

58:09.224 --> 58:11.863
Canine transport
loading at platform 2.

58:12.064 --> 58:15.579
282nd Airborne Chihuahuas,
report to your briefing.

58:15.784 --> 58:19.060
This is it, kid. Welcome to HQ.

58:19.264 --> 58:20.697
Roll over!

58:22.544 --> 58:23.738
Roll over! Sit!

58:23.944 --> 58:27.823
Spaying and neutering
reversal procedures on level 3.

58:37.824 --> 58:40.896
For defensive purposes, of course.

58:41.824 --> 58:43.223
Of course.

58:43.464 --> 58:46.376
Personnel are required
to curb themselves.

58:46.584 --> 58:48.575
Remember to scoop your poop.

58:48.904 --> 58:53.136
Testing, testing. You've reached
headquarters. Please log in.

58:53.344 --> 58:55.141
Tiger, what are you doing?

58:56.664 --> 58:57.653
Bad dog!

59:01.384 --> 59:02.942
Recognize these humans?

59:03.224 --> 59:05.784
If you want to see them alive again...

59:05.984 --> 59:08.418
...bring the formula and all notes...

59:08.624 --> 59:13.015
... regarding Mr. Brody's research
to the 9th Street Pier at midnight.

59:13.224 --> 59:18.344
If you refuse, well,
they will be put to sleep.

59:18.904 --> 59:20.542
Assemble the delegates.

59:34.304 --> 59:35.976
Order! Order, please.

59:36.184 --> 59:38.015
Delegates, please! Order!

59:41.584 --> 59:45.702
We cannot give up the formula.
Sacrifice the Brody family.

59:45.904 --> 59:49.897
Nein! Lives are at stake.
We cannot deem them expendable.

59:50.224 --> 59:53.102
Delegates, please! Order!

59:53.304 --> 59:54.817
I must have order!

59:55.344 --> 59:56.823
Please, no Frisbee!

59:59.264 --> 01:00:01.300
Steve, crowd control.

01:00:09.184 --> 01:00:10.537
Sit!

01:00:11.744 --> 01:00:14.463
Now then, delegates.
It's time to vote.

01:00:14.664 --> 01:00:18.418
-Wait! Can I say something first?
-Kid, quiet!

01:00:18.624 --> 01:00:22.253
I was told it was an agent's job
to protect people.

01:00:22.464 --> 01:00:24.341
-They're my family!
-Enough!

01:00:24.544 --> 01:00:28.219
Delegates, it's time.
Family or formula?

01:00:28.504 --> 01:00:31.416
-No! Wait. Wait!
-Just minutes ago...

01:00:33.184 --> 01:00:36.062
... the council voted
to sacrifice the Brodys...

01:00:36.264 --> 01:00:40.701
... to safeguard humanity
against the cat threat forever.

01:00:40.904 --> 01:00:44.658
For Canine News Network,
this is Wolf Blitzer.

01:00:44.864 --> 01:00:46.377
Poor kid.

01:00:46.664 --> 01:00:48.655
I need some equipment, guys.

01:00:55.344 --> 01:00:57.414
Hold on a second, kid.

01:00:57.624 --> 01:00:59.740
-Hold it.
-They can't do this.

01:00:59.944 --> 01:01:03.539
-You should've fought for me!
-What good would it do?

01:01:03.744 --> 01:01:06.656
What about "Man's best friend"?
History 1 01 .

01:01:06.864 --> 01:01:09.901
Lesson two.
We protect and work for them.

01:01:10.104 --> 01:01:13.016
We tolerate that stupid
baby-talk crap.

01:01:13.224 --> 01:01:14.896
Then they go to college. . .

01:01:15.104 --> 01:01:18.813
. . .and dump you with an old lady
who can't throw a ball!

01:01:20.864 --> 01:01:22.980
Is that what happened to you?

01:01:23.184 --> 01:01:27.302
You're gonna blame my family
for what some boy did to you?

01:01:29.824 --> 01:01:33.134
Look, kid. I'm sorry
it played out like this. . .

01:01:33.344 --> 01:01:35.699
. . .but it's over. We're shut down.

01:01:38.664 --> 01:01:42.100
Don't be scared, Scotty.
Everything will be okay.

01:01:42.304 --> 01:01:46.502
-I'm not scared, Mom.
-It's all right. Only natural.

01:01:46.704 --> 01:01:49.616
-We'll be okay.
-Mom, really, I'm okay.

01:01:49.824 --> 01:01:53.294
-I can tell you're trying to be brave.
-Mom--

01:01:53.504 --> 01:01:55.301
Darn it! Don't be scared!

01:01:55.864 --> 01:01:59.015
-I am your rock!
-Please.

01:01:59.704 --> 01:02:02.218
Who kidnapped us, Uruguay or Chad?

01:02:02.424 --> 01:02:06.576
-I heard the news. How's Lou?
-I told him not to get attached.

01:02:06.904 --> 01:02:10.135
Sure, "An agent focuses
only on the mission.

01:02:10.344 --> 01:02:14.496
-That's why my family didn't love me. "
-We all have sob stories.

01:02:14.704 --> 01:02:16.217
Now he has his.

01:02:42.584 --> 01:02:45.542
-I have to go.
-I said to go before we left.

01:02:53.864 --> 01:02:56.059
So you brought the research.

01:02:56.384 --> 01:02:58.375
Foolish puppy.

01:03:06.984 --> 01:03:09.179
He took the research.

01:03:15.384 --> 01:03:19.218
Butch, you there?
Lou's in trouble at the pier!

01:03:19.944 --> 01:03:21.616
Dock 14. Hurry!

01:03:57.864 --> 01:04:01.698
-They tricked me.
-They took the formula?

01:04:01.904 --> 01:04:04.782
I thought they would let my family go.

01:04:15.864 --> 01:04:19.573
How many dogs does it take
to overthrow mankind?

01:04:19.784 --> 01:04:22.014
Just one stupid puppy.

01:04:22.224 --> 01:04:23.862
Where is my family?!

01:04:24.064 --> 01:04:25.338
Oh, they're alive.

01:04:25.584 --> 01:04:28.815
For now. But it won 't matter.
You see, I've--

01:04:31.024 --> 01:04:32.503
This isn 't NASCAR!

01:04:33.584 --> 01:04:37.543
I've seized the formula,
and in hours, I'll reverse it. . .

01:04:37.744 --> 01:04:40.178
. . .giving me the power
to make humans. . .

01:04:40.384 --> 01:04:42.215
-. . .allergic to dogs.
-What?!

01:04:45.344 --> 01:04:49.496
How can I gloat gleefully
when you drive like a chimpanzee?!

01:04:49.904 --> 01:04:54.420
I will make all of humanity
violently allergic to your kind.

01:04:54.624 --> 01:04:57.775
When you're all despised
by those you protect...

01:04:57.984 --> 01:05:02.978
. . .you will be cast out, leaving me to
lead cats in a glorious revolution. . .

01:05:03.184 --> 01:05:04.902
... to conquer the world!

01:05:06.384 --> 01:05:07.863
-What will we do?
-"We"?

01:05:08.064 --> 01:05:12.216
You doomed the human race forever.
There's nothing to do.

01:05:12.624 --> 01:05:15.343
You always give up too easy, Butch.

01:05:16.904 --> 01:05:19.338
-Is that what I think it is?
-What?

01:05:19.544 --> 01:05:21.978
Yep, it's the Cat Tracker 2000.

01:05:24.384 --> 01:05:27.979
Those fleabags must be
running for the hills.

01:05:28.584 --> 01:05:30.222
That's what I was thinking.

01:05:32.624 --> 01:05:35.184
Faster. I thought you were union!

01:05:35.784 --> 01:05:37.740
I got a bonus for the guy....

01:05:49.624 --> 01:05:52.582
That's it.
The Christmas tree from the note.

01:05:56.104 --> 01:05:58.538
What the heck are they up to?

01:06:02.744 --> 01:06:05.463
That's enough mice to feed an army.

01:06:10.584 --> 01:06:13.178
-Hello, Professor Brody.
-Who are you?

01:06:14.504 --> 01:06:15.937
Sorry about the wait. . .

01:06:16.144 --> 01:06:20.342
-. . .but we had tests to run.
-Who's that? Who are you?

01:06:20.544 --> 01:06:22.500
Is this about my work?

01:06:23.584 --> 01:06:28.783
You're from one of those multinational,
corporate, profit-mongering. . .

01:06:29.104 --> 01:06:31.572
. . .pharmaceutical companies stealing--

01:06:31.784 --> 01:06:36.016
Pharmaceutical company?
I'm afraid you misunderstand me.

01:06:36.224 --> 01:06:39.102
What's going on? Hello?
Where'd you go?

01:06:39.304 --> 01:06:41.260
That smell. A feline essence--

01:06:46.384 --> 01:06:47.578
Where are you?

01:06:50.304 --> 01:06:52.864
Show yourself.
You can't hide forever.

01:06:55.584 --> 01:06:57.700
But I've nothing to hide.

01:07:04.624 --> 01:07:06.376
Cool!

01:07:16.824 --> 01:07:19.463
Will someone please shut her up?!

01:07:21.304 --> 01:07:24.262
I have an ingenious test to perform.

01:07:24.784 --> 01:07:27.537
Are you mutants?
I read this comic book--

01:07:27.744 --> 01:07:31.737
"I read this in a comic book. "
You make me sick!

01:07:34.624 --> 01:07:36.615
Calm down, honey. Calm down.

01:07:36.824 --> 01:07:40.499
It's an experiment gone awry.
You're turning blue!

01:07:42.544 --> 01:07:44.136
It's about time.

01:07:46.464 --> 01:07:48.056
My captive audience. . .

01:07:48.264 --> 01:07:52.655
. . .shall we play a little game,
young Brody? Excuse me.

01:07:52.904 --> 01:07:55.134
The vial! The green one!

01:07:55.344 --> 01:07:56.459
Here, boss.

01:07:57.864 --> 01:08:00.298
Oh, hello, Mr. Sinister Serum.

01:08:00.544 --> 01:08:05.095
-What's in that?
-My quote-unquote master's fake snow. . .

01:08:05.384 --> 01:08:07.898
. . .is the perfect medium
for carrying. . .

01:08:08.104 --> 01:08:09.457
. . .your disease.

01:08:10.984 --> 01:08:15.899
Ah, yes. Thereby breaking the bond
between a boy and his dog.

01:08:16.464 --> 01:08:17.453
No, wait.

01:08:17.663 --> 01:08:19.575
Bad. Bad talking cat.

01:08:19.783 --> 01:08:21.103
Scat.

01:08:21.823 --> 01:08:23.381
Lower the cage!

01:08:32.384 --> 01:08:33.499
Success!

01:08:33.703 --> 01:08:36.901
-You! Go assemble the troops.
-Yes, sir.

01:08:40.344 --> 01:08:43.654
As for you, Brody herd. . .

01:08:43.863 --> 01:08:45.456
. . .I have a very. . .

01:08:45.663 --> 01:08:47.541
. . .very special. . .

01:08:48.024 --> 01:08:49.502
. . .gift! What?!

01:08:50.783 --> 01:08:52.581
I said buy a real gun!

01:08:52.783 --> 01:08:57.618
-That's what I was thinking.
-What use can I have for this?!

01:09:06.504 --> 01:09:08.540
Hey! I'm so clever.

01:09:09.783 --> 01:09:12.344
This here is just plain fun.

01:09:13.863 --> 01:09:15.536
-Stay here.
-Why?

01:09:15.743 --> 01:09:17.143
Because I hate you.

01:09:18.384 --> 01:09:21.341
No! Help! Let me out!

01:09:22.743 --> 01:09:27.943
In just hours, every human in the world
will be allergic to dogs.

01:09:28.304 --> 01:09:32.456
But such a mammoth plot
requires brothers-in-arms.

01:09:32.663 --> 01:09:34.096
And this. . .

01:09:34.304 --> 01:09:37.740
. . .is where my genius
truly comes to pass.

01:09:37.984 --> 01:09:42.899
For I have chosen a comrade that can
invade every home in the world.

01:09:43.104 --> 01:09:47.301
Because it's already
in every home in the world!

01:09:48.264 --> 01:09:49.582
Mice!

01:09:50.464 --> 01:09:51.897
Son of my mom!

01:09:52.104 --> 01:09:54.857
Mice! The unlikeliest of allies.

01:09:55.064 --> 01:09:57.942
Thousands of you covered
in dog allergy.

01:09:58.144 --> 01:09:59.702
You're all asking:

01:09:59.904 --> 01:10:03.180
"How can he spread the allergy
to the world?"

01:10:04.184 --> 01:10:08.097
Open your World Domination pamphlets
and I'll show you.

01:10:10.144 --> 01:10:13.898
Enter the sewers and with the maps
in appendix B. . .

01:10:14.104 --> 01:10:17.062
. . .you'll cross the nation.
Half go to homes. . .

01:10:17.264 --> 01:10:19.732
. . .infecting every human,
while the rest--

01:10:20.504 --> 01:10:21.619
Turn the page.

01:10:22.664 --> 01:10:25.053
--will stow away
on planes and boats. . .

01:10:25.264 --> 01:10:28.222
. . .to infect the world.
With the dogs gone. . .

01:10:28.464 --> 01:10:32.901
. . .cats will overthrow the humans
and you'll be given your reward:

01:10:33.104 --> 01:10:35.937
1 6 pounds of Monterey Jack. . .

01:10:36.144 --> 01:10:39.102
. . .and the continent of Australia!

01:10:41.264 --> 01:10:42.743
-Australia!
-Yeah!

01:10:42.944 --> 01:10:44.536
Open the sewer hatch!

01:10:49.664 --> 01:10:51.461
Okay, here's the plan.

01:10:58.944 --> 01:11:01.060
Flee across the world!

01:11:01.264 --> 01:11:03.095
Go forth and infect everyone!

01:11:03.624 --> 01:11:05.455
Be all you can be!

01:11:05.664 --> 01:11:08.337
My plan has come full circle!

01:11:08.784 --> 01:11:10.934
You have nothing to fear but
mousetraps. . .

01:11:11.144 --> 01:11:13.055
. . .and, well, me.

01:11:15.064 --> 01:11:16.213
He ate Gary!

01:11:16.704 --> 01:11:17.932
Run!

01:11:19.344 --> 01:11:20.618
What's that?

01:11:27.784 --> 01:11:29.217
It's over, Tinkles!

01:11:29.464 --> 01:11:30.897
Dogs. Where are they?

01:11:32.944 --> 01:11:35.538
Lou, the hatch. Close the hatch.

01:11:36.104 --> 01:11:37.059
Ivy, now!

01:11:37.264 --> 01:11:38.583
Bath time!

01:11:39.744 --> 01:11:41.655
Surrender, you're finished!

01:11:43.024 --> 01:11:43.934
Let's go!

01:11:44.384 --> 01:11:46.056
I have a plane to catch.

01:12:00.864 --> 01:12:04.061
Ivy, go find Peek and Sam.
I've got to find Lou.

01:12:10.384 --> 01:12:11.294
Good boy.

01:12:13.784 --> 01:12:15.297
Hey! Stop!

01:12:15.664 --> 01:12:17.382
Stop. I need to crush you.

01:12:17.584 --> 01:12:19.097
I'll get you.

01:12:21.344 --> 01:12:23.335
How did you find us?

01:12:23.544 --> 01:12:26.616
-Come on, we have to go.
-Can you talk too?

01:12:30.344 --> 01:12:32.062
I'll scratch that for you!

01:12:34.464 --> 01:12:36.534
I'll squeeze you like a tick!

01:12:40.944 --> 01:12:42.013
Come on, honey!

01:12:43.304 --> 01:12:45.943
Come here.
I got a Milk-Bone for you.

01:12:49.104 --> 01:12:50.219
I've got you now.

01:12:53.264 --> 01:12:56.893
-Put me down, hairball!
-I just want a hug!

01:12:59.464 --> 01:13:02.103
I'm coming, Butch!

01:13:06.264 --> 01:13:08.220
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

01:13:08.464 --> 01:13:10.978
You're too late, puppy.

01:13:12.864 --> 01:13:14.058
I'm king of the world!

01:13:14.264 --> 01:13:15.379
Get him, Lou!

01:13:15.584 --> 01:13:18.144
I give up. Please don't hurt me.

01:13:18.624 --> 01:13:21.092
Get your butt off my face,
Tinkles!

01:13:32.144 --> 01:13:34.339
Now, where was l? Oh, yes.

01:13:40.064 --> 01:13:41.816
Now the final crushing.

01:13:49.264 --> 01:13:50.219
-Hey!
-What?!

01:13:56.224 --> 01:13:57.782
Dogs rule!

01:13:59.584 --> 01:14:01.256
This is a minor setback.

01:14:02.144 --> 01:14:04.260
You're finished, Fluffy!

01:14:06.664 --> 01:14:08.143
Butch! We did it!

01:14:23.224 --> 01:14:25.897
-Come on, Scotty!
-Come on! Quickly!

01:14:31.944 --> 01:14:32.933
Come on!

01:14:43.464 --> 01:14:45.978
Wait. Where's Lou?!

01:15:31.984 --> 01:15:33.781
Kid, we did it.

01:15:33.984 --> 01:15:36.976
We saved them like you said.
You were right.

01:15:37.184 --> 01:15:39.061
And you were right about me.

01:15:39.344 --> 01:15:40.140
Kid?

01:15:40.344 --> 01:15:41.299
Lou?

01:15:43.864 --> 01:15:45.297
Oh, no.

01:16:11.704 --> 01:16:13.137
Come on, Lou, wake up.

01:16:15.264 --> 01:16:17.220
You're not a loser, Lou.

01:16:18.544 --> 01:16:20.455
You're my best friend.

01:16:22.944 --> 01:16:23.979
Wake up.

01:16:27.744 --> 01:16:29.655
And you're my best friend too.

01:16:38.464 --> 01:16:40.932
Mom, Dad, he's alive!

01:16:41.464 --> 01:16:45.901
Mom, Dad, he's alive!
Come quick!

01:16:47.064 --> 01:16:48.133
He came back!

01:16:48.344 --> 01:16:51.302
-You have the right to--
-You have the right. . .

01:16:51.544 --> 01:16:54.980
-. . .to remain silent.
-Anything you say can be used. . . .

01:16:55.184 --> 01:16:56.902
Oh, my God!

01:16:57.104 --> 01:16:59.095
And the right to a dog attorney.

01:17:02.944 --> 01:17:04.855
-Try this again.
-Athletic.

01:17:05.144 --> 01:17:06.577
Get it, Lou! Come on!

01:17:06.784 --> 01:17:08.536
Nice! You're getting good.

01:17:10.024 --> 01:17:11.662
Put your head forward.

01:17:14.984 --> 01:17:16.212
All right, Dad!

01:17:16.464 --> 01:17:19.183
-Lou, go get it.
-That's a triple.

01:17:19.384 --> 01:17:20.783
Hey, kid.

01:17:20.984 --> 01:17:23.054
Everything go okay at HQ?

01:17:23.264 --> 01:17:26.017
They're eating out of my paw.
How's things?

01:17:26.224 --> 01:17:30.661
-Great. Want to play some ball?
-No, I gotta get back to work.

01:17:32.584 --> 01:17:34.575
Bring it here. Find the ball.

01:17:38.584 --> 01:17:41.701
Come on! Go get it! Come on!

01:17:41.904 --> 01:17:43.701
He's got it! He's got it!

01:17:43.904 --> 01:17:47.374
Bring that ball!
Bring that ball back!

01:17:48.304 --> 01:17:50.977
He would've made a great agent.

01:17:56.504 --> 01:18:01.373
That's right, Mr. Tinkles.
You have been a very bad kitty.

01:18:01.624 --> 01:18:05.094
I'm just going to have to
teach you how to behave.

01:18:06.704 --> 01:18:11.255
Now you're going to have to live
with me and my sisters!

01:18:12.304 --> 01:18:14.101
Mr. Tinkles!

01:18:19.144 --> 01:18:22.295
Look what we made for you!

01:18:29.984 --> 01:18:33.340
-I could eat you with a spoon!
-I can't take it!

01:18:49.864 --> 01:18:51.741
This can 't be happening.
