00:01.060 --> 00:02.493
NARRATOR: Previously on
Pretty Little Liars...

00:02.530 --> 00:06.034
The winner gets a
$20,000 scholarship.

00:06.070 --> 00:07.230
We're gonna have to pay
for my tuition somehow.

00:07.270 --> 00:08.635
You're not _
pageant material.

00:08.670 --> 00:09.762
I'm not doing
that pageant.

00:09.810 --> 00:11.300
Well, I am, for you.

00:11.340 --> 00:12.534
SPENCER: Any chance
Wren still has

00:12.580 --> 00:14.070
that contact at Oxford?

00:15.440 --> 00:17.044
they can completely
withdraw my acceptance.

00:17.080 --> 00:18.206
If you need a tutor...

00:18.250 --> 00:19.740
I'm Eric,
Talia's husband.

00:19.780 --> 00:21.509
You told him
I was an experiment,

00:21.550 --> 00:22.778
a one time thing.

00:22.820 --> 00:24.742
If you are "A,"
you're counting

00:24.790 --> 00:26.382
on that last little
shred of me

00:26.420 --> 00:28.251
that gives a damn about
what happens to you.

00:28.290 --> 00:29.222
And you shouldn't.

00:29.260 --> 00:30.557
"Thanks for donating to
my get-into-jail fund.

00:30.590 --> 00:32.126
_A.ll

00:32.160 --> 00:33.821
You have something that
belongs to us, Cyrus.

00:33.860 --> 00:35.589
Well, maybe we could
work out a trade.

00:35.630 --> 00:37.769
And when I find out who
"A" is, Alison gets out of jail,

00:37.800 --> 00:40.166
and your sister and her
friends are finely safe.

00:40.200 --> 00:41.337
Do you think that "A"
double-crossed Mona

00:41.370 --> 00:42.667
and killed her?

00:42.710 --> 00:44.166
Why are you so sure
that Alison isn't "A"?

00:44.210 --> 00:45.666
Cyrus told me that
"A" had him get

00:45.710 --> 00:47.075
Alison out of town
that day.

00:47.110 --> 00:48.236
Do we tell Alison?

00:48.280 --> 00:49.804
We destroyed
a lot of evidence

00:49.850 --> 00:51.408
that could have proved
that she was innocent.

00:51.450 --> 00:52.815
Well, are we gonna say
anything before her trial?

00:52.850 --> 00:54.249
We have to.

00:58.620 --> 00:59.712
Did you hear back
from Hanna?

00:59.760 --> 01:00.818
I don't know.

01:00.860 --> 01:02.179
They have
our cell phones.

01:02.230 --> 01:03.254
Oh, right.

01:04.690 --> 01:06.157
(sighs)
This feels weird.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.622
Yeah, of course,
it feels weird.

01:07.660 --> 01:10.094
_We're in a_locked room
wrth razor Wire on the roof.

01:10.130 --> 01:13.258
No, I mean coming here
with our tail between our legs.

01:13.300 --> 01:15.165
You don't think
we owe her an apology?

01:15.200 --> 01:17.168
Aria, we formed
a human blockade.

01:17.210 --> 01:18.563
She's locked in a cell
because of us.

01:18.610 --> 01:21.204
No, she's locked in a cell
because of karma.

01:21.240 --> 01:22.741
Well,
and because of us.

01:22.780 --> 01:25.203
Hey, look, no one is
saying that she's a saint.

01:25.250 --> 01:26.717
Or even a decent
human being.

01:26.750 --> 01:27.842
But she's on trial
for a murder

01:27.880 --> 01:29.381
that she didn't commit.

01:29.420 --> 01:31.285
Mona set her up and
then was killed herself,

01:31.320 --> 01:33.709
and now Ali's
going down for it.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.409
I wouldn't wish that
on my worst enemy.

01:35.460 --> 01:37.485
Well, she's
definitely runner-up.

01:37.530 --> 01:39.088
( buzzing )

01:44.830 --> 01:46.866
He was scared
to say anything.

01:46.900 --> 01:48.458
He still thought
Mona was alive

01:48.500 --> 01:50.206
and he didn't want
to put her in danger.

01:50.240 --> 01:52.276
So her plan was to just
let me rot in here?

01:52.310 --> 01:53.868
Only until she found out
who "A" was,

01:53.910 --> 01:55.207
but then she was
going to come back.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.343
And you'd be
released.

01:56.380 --> 01:58.871
But now she--

01:58.910 --> 02:00.377
she's not coming back.

02:01.780 --> 02:02.849
We're gonna
figure out a way

02:02.890 --> 02:04.380
to get you
out of here.

02:06.790 --> 02:09.156
Where's Hanna?

02:11.330 --> 02:12.922
She really wanted
to be here,

02:12.960 --> 02:15.326
but she had to spend
the day with her mom.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.199
Your visiting hour
is over.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.867
Let's go,
girls.

02:22.270 --> 02:24.409
We'll be back soon,
okay?

02:28.810 --> 02:29.777
( buzzing )

02:29.810 --> 02:31.346
Aria?

02:35.480 --> 02:36.686
You know I'm gonna
have to tell my lavwers

02:36.720 --> 02:37.880
about Mike, right?

02:37.920 --> 02:39.888
Ali,
please don't do that.

02:39.920 --> 02:41.581
His testimony
might be the only thing

02:41.620 --> 02:43.178
that can save me.

02:44.560 --> 02:46.357
Can you just hold off?

02:46.400 --> 02:47.719
Please?

02:47.760 --> 02:50.297
Just let me find Cyrus,
maybe he can lead me to "A."

02:50.330 --> 02:51.968
You've been
looking for "A"--

02:52.000 --> 02:54.537
No, we've been trying
to find "A's" henchman.

02:54.570 --> 02:57.232
We thought that "A"
was in a jail cell.

03:02.450 --> 03:03.906
Okay.

03:05.550 --> 03:06.744
I will-- I'll wait.

03:06.780 --> 03:08.941
But...

03:08.980 --> 03:11.289
I want you to know
I'm not trying to hurt him.

03:13.420 --> 03:15.854
I just might not have
another choice.

03:17.960 --> 03:20.292
* Got a secret,
can you keep it? *

03:20.330 --> 03:22.662
* Swear this one you'll save

03:22.700 --> 03:25.294
_* Better lock it
In your pocket *

03:25.330 --> 03:27.833
* Taking this one
to the grave *

03:27.870 --> 03:29.929
* IfI show you, then I know

03:29.970 --> 03:32.700
* You won't tell
what I saId *

03:32.740 --> 03:35.402
* 'Cause two can
keep a secret *

03:35.440 --> 03:38.671
* If one of them is dead

03:38.710 --> 03:40.018
Where were you?

03:40.050 --> 03:41.938
I'm sorry, you guys,
I chickened out.

03:41.980 --> 03:43.709
I couldn't
go back there.

03:43.750 --> 03:46.856
Not after calling her a liar
and a murderer to her face.

03:46.890 --> 03:47.959
She is a liar.

03:47.990 --> 03:49.423
Up until yesterday,

03:49.460 --> 03:51.257
we all thought
she was a murderer, too.

03:51.290 --> 03:53.019
Well, you guys didn't
make a personal appearance

03:53.060 --> 03:55.358
to cut her open,
pour salt in the wound,

03:55.400 --> 03:56.958
and then
exfoliate it.

03:57.930 --> 03:58.897
Was she upset?

03:58.930 --> 04:00.431
I don't know.

04:00.470 --> 04:01.789
Your absence kind of
took a second position

04:01.840 --> 04:03.364
to the bomb we had
to drop about Mona.

04:03.410 --> 04:04.968
After we left,
Ali was still pretty much

04:05.010 --> 04:06.329
in a state of shock.

04:06.380 --> 04:07.972
Which apparently
is contagious.

04:08.010 --> 04:09.739
What's going on?

04:09.780 --> 04:11.008
I'm fine.

04:11.050 --> 04:12.540
Is this
about your brother?

04:12.580 --> 04:15.708
Look, if we don't
figure out who "A" is

04:15.750 --> 04:17.286
before Ali's
trial starts--

04:17.320 --> 04:19.459
She's going to feed Mike
to her defense team.

04:19.490 --> 04:20.889
Can they make him
take the stand?

04:20.920 --> 04:22.057
Yeah.

04:22.090 --> 04:23.455
He'll be
a hostile witness.

04:23.490 --> 04:24.889
No, you guys,
it's not about

04:24.930 --> 04:26.591
him getting in trouble
with the law.

04:26.630 --> 04:28.848
Once Mike becomes Ali's
get-out-of-jaII-free card,

04:28.900 --> 04:30.959
he also becomes
"A's" number one target.

04:34.070 --> 04:36.038
No, you don't have
to come to the house,

04:36.070 --> 04:38.800
Peter, I can handle it.

04:38.840 --> 04:40.569
She just walked in.

04:40.610 --> 04:42.373
I'll call you later.

04:43.580 --> 04:44.945
I thought you and Dad
weren't really talking.

04:44.980 --> 04:46.641
We weren't.

04:46.680 --> 04:49.046
But when our daughter is
making field trips to prison,

04:49.080 --> 04:50.911
I figure
I owe him a jingle.

04:52.420 --> 04:53.557
This family
has bent over backwards

04:53.590 --> 04:55.057
to keep you
out of that place,

04:55.090 --> 04:57.320
and now you're voluntarily
showing up there?

04:57.360 --> 04:59.851
Mom, it's the first time I've
even gone to visit Alison--

04:59.900 --> 05:01.390
And your last.

05:01.430 --> 05:04.069
This series of poor
choices ends today.

05:05.870 --> 05:07.531
If you're going
to skip school,

05:07.570 --> 05:09.936
then it's going to be so you
can get into a better one.

05:10.770 --> 05:12.067
London?

05:12.110 --> 05:14.578
I spoke to Wren, and he
managed to get you a--

05:14.610 --> 05:15.577
You called Wren?

05:15.610 --> 05:16.975
You hate Wren.

05:17.010 --> 05:18.546
Well, I'm not holding out
for Jonny Raymond's

05:18.580 --> 05:21.572
connections
to pull through.

05:21.620 --> 05:23.815
Wren got you an interview
with a very well-respected

05:23.850 --> 05:25.112
professor at Oxford.

05:25.150 --> 05:26.412
You'll be staying
with him and Melissa.

05:26.460 --> 05:27.711
Your plane
leaves tonight.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.648
So if I were you,
I'd start packing.

05:33.660 --> 05:34.729
Have a nice day.

05:36.470 --> 05:37.425
Emily?

05:37.470 --> 05:38.129
Hi.

05:38.170 --> 05:39.535
I'm Claire Handelman.

05:39.570 --> 05:40.594
Hi.

05:40.640 --> 05:43.507
I've had your picture staring
up at me from my desk.

05:43.540 --> 05:45.098
I'm the Contestant
Coordinator

05:45.140 --> 05:46.698
of the Glass Slipper
Collective.

05:46.740 --> 05:48.378
Oh. Hi.

05:48.410 --> 05:49.809
Was everything okay
with my application?

05:49.850 --> 05:51.442
Actually, no.

05:51.480 --> 05:54.040
You forgot
a parent's signature.

05:54.080 --> 05:55.115
Oh, sorry.

05:55.150 --> 05:56.640
I must've missed that.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.385
My mom is visiting
my dad at his base.

05:58.420 --> 06:00.718
Can she _
fax her permISSIon?

06:00.760 --> 06:02.079
Sure, no problem.

06:02.120 --> 06:03.451
What's this?

06:03.490 --> 06:05.082
Oh,
the event's calendar.

06:05.130 --> 06:08.019
Meet and greet, pancake
breakfast, orientation.

06:08.060 --> 06:10.494
Each one of you is also
assigned a fairy godmother

06:10.530 --> 06:11.861
to help you
walk through it.

06:11.900 --> 06:13.663
It's our version
of a den mother.

06:13.700 --> 06:15.395
We keep you girls
very busy.

06:15.440 --> 06:18.102
Oh, I had no idea it was
such a time commitment.

06:18.140 --> 06:20.074
Well, is that
gonna be a problem?

06:20.110 --> 06:22.101
No, no, not at all.

06:22.140 --> 06:25.007
Um, my boss is out of
town for the day,

06:25.050 --> 06:27.018
but when he gets back
I'll talk to him

06:27.050 --> 06:28.415
about swapping
some shifts.

06:28.450 --> 06:29.644
Oh, you tell
your boss

06:29.690 --> 06:31.612
you're a very
promising contestant.

06:33.090 --> 06:34.489
You could have
collected

06:34.520 --> 06:36.385
a couple of
glass slippers by now.

06:38.660 --> 06:40.890
This has to be
a quick visit, girls.

06:40.930 --> 06:42.568
She is upstairs
in her room.

06:42.600 --> 06:43.669
Thank you.

06:50.870 --> 06:51.905
Mrs. Hastings?

06:51.940 --> 06:53.134
Can I ask you
something?

06:53.940 --> 06:56.033
A legal question.

06:56.080 --> 06:57.843
Sure.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.541
Um...

06:59.580 --> 07:01.013
I don't really know
where to start.

07:01.050 --> 07:02.176
It's kind of personal.

07:02.220 --> 07:03.710
Uh, Aria, I'm happy
to talk to you,

07:03.750 --> 07:06.787
but I-I need you to
understand something.

07:06.820 --> 07:10.051
You and I don't_have
attorney-client prIVIlege.

07:10.090 --> 07:12.149
What does
that mean exactly?

07:12.190 --> 07:13.919
Simple answer?

07:13.960 --> 07:16.155
I may not be able to keep
whatever you tell me

07:16.200 --> 07:19.169
just between us,
even if I want to.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.800
I know it's not
your usual rate,

07:28.840 --> 07:33.573
but for the next hour
will you be my lawyer?

07:39.690 --> 07:41.214
Talia?
Can I talk to you?

07:43.630 --> 07:45.154
I know Amanda was
going to be helping you

07:45.190 --> 07:46.259
in the kitchen
this week,

07:46.290 --> 07:47.951
but something's
come up,

07:48.000 --> 07:50.093
and I was hoping she could
cover my shifts instead.

07:50.130 --> 07:51.859
I don't think
that'll be possible.

07:51.900 --> 07:53.868
Really?

07:55.040 --> 07:56.769
This is how
it's going to be?

07:56.810 --> 07:59.199
I mean, I didn't say
what I said to hurt you.

07:59.240 --> 08:01.208
It's not about that,
Emily.

08:01.240 --> 08:02.741
Today is my last day.

08:02.780 --> 08:03.747
I already told Ezra.

08:03.780 --> 08:04.804
I quit.

08:05.810 --> 08:09.075
Was this person involved
in the crime directly?

08:09.120 --> 08:10.246
No.

08:10.290 --> 08:12.815
But he did
have information

08:12.860 --> 08:14.555
that could really
help the police.

08:14.590 --> 08:15.716
And he was aware of that?

08:15.760 --> 08:16.829
Yeah.

08:16.860 --> 08:18.851
And he withheld it?

08:18.890 --> 08:21.723
Yeah.

08:21.760 --> 08:25.719
Well, without being familiar
with any of the particulars,

08:25.770 --> 08:28.534
I'd say that if he impeded
a police investigation

08:28.570 --> 08:30.162
knowingly,
then, yes,

08:30.210 --> 08:32.678
he'd definitely
face charges.

08:32.710 --> 08:35.099
What--
What kind of charges?

08:35.140 --> 08:36.573
Like, jail time?

08:36.610 --> 08:39.499
It depends on the nature
of the crime.

08:40.750 --> 08:41.717
All right.

08:41.750 --> 08:44.184
Well, what if
it were serious

08:44.220 --> 08:46.757
and someone ended up
getting killed?

08:48.290 --> 08:49.848
How much trouble
would he be in?

08:51.790 --> 08:53.189
A lot.

08:59.900 --> 09:01.299
Spencer, you
cannot leave now!

09:01.340 --> 09:03.001
We just found out
that All isn't "A"

09:03.040 --> 09:04.337
and we still don't know
who's trying to turn us

09:04.370 --> 09:05.803
into a chain-gang.

09:05.840 --> 09:07.137
Well, what am I
supposed to do, Hanna?

09:07.180 --> 09:08.807
Miss your flight.
Please.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.808
Do not think that my mom
won't be waiting in duty-free

09:10.850 --> 09:12.613
just to make sure
I catch the next one.

09:12.650 --> 09:14.311
What did Toby say
about this?

09:14.350 --> 09:15.942
I don't know.
I didn't tell Toby.

09:15.980 --> 09:17.584
The only way to get his
attention these days

09:17.620 --> 09:18.917
_is over
a police scanner.

09:18.950 --> 09:20.815
Can your mom postpone
the interview?

09:20.860 --> 09:23.055
If you have any suggestions
on what you think

09:23.090 --> 09:24.978
I should say to her,
I'm all ears.

09:25.030 --> 09:27.692
Why not tell the truth?

09:27.730 --> 09:28.924
What?

09:28.960 --> 09:30.325
I think it's time that
you finally come clean

09:30.370 --> 09:31.860
and you ask
your mom for help.

09:31.900 --> 09:33.197
Are you serious?

09:33.240 --> 09:34.969
Hanna,
we can't do that.

09:35.000 --> 09:35.967
Why not?

09:36.000 --> 09:37.103
Maybe Hanna's right.

09:37.140 --> 09:38.061
What do
we have to lose?

09:38.110 --> 09:40.601
Uh, my brother.

09:40.640 --> 09:43.108
Aria, Spencer's
mom can help Mike.

09:43.150 --> 09:45.072
No, she can't
help us find "A."

09:45.110 --> 09:47.943
You guys, do we really
want to rattle "A's" cage

09:47.980 --> 09:49.277
by telling now?

09:49.320 --> 09:51.311
We all know what happens
when we do that.

10:18.380 --> 10:20.245
DiLaurentis?

10:21.050 --> 10:22.278
Come with me.

10:40.270 --> 10:41.931
Mrs. Hastings?

10:43.170 --> 10:44.660
What are you
doing here?

10:44.710 --> 10:46.735
I want to know why
my daughter and her friends

10:46.780 --> 10:48.304
are visiting you
all of a sudden.

10:48.340 --> 10:50.672
Shouldn't you ask
your daughter that?

10:50.710 --> 10:51.745
She won't give me
an answer.

10:51.780 --> 10:53.008
So I thought
I'd get it

10:55.750 --> 10:57.889
I've heard that
your own brother

10:57.920 --> 10:59.888
refuses to come here.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.751
So why would
these girls?

11:01.790 --> 11:04.088
Because
I'm telling the truth.

11:05.330 --> 11:06.319
I shouldn't be here.

11:06.360 --> 11:07.952
And they know that now.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.889
Unfortunately, Alison,
with the lies you've told,

11:10.930 --> 11:12.898
even if your
friends believe you,

11:12.940 --> 11:14.430
it's doubtful
a jury will.

11:14.470 --> 11:16.859
That's why I want
to take the stand.

11:18.340 --> 11:19.807
I_want to tell
my srde of the story.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.171
But my lawyers
won't let me.

11:21.210 --> 11:23.770
Your lawyers are right.

11:23.810 --> 11:25.038
You could say
the wrong thing

11:25.080 --> 11:27.378
and wind up
incriminating yourself.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.876
But I can't just
sit here quietly

11:28.920 --> 11:30.410
while someone
gets up there

11:30.450 --> 11:31.917
and tries to make me
look lIke a murderer.

11:31.950 --> 11:35.010
Alison, you've
told so many lies.

11:35.060 --> 11:36.482
People know that now.

11:36.520 --> 11:38.954
And not
just in Rosewood.

11:38.990 --> 11:40.799
Your lawyers are going
to have a hard time

11:40.830 --> 11:42.798
finding a juror
willing to believe you.

11:42.830 --> 11:45.321
I want to tell my side,
because, for once,

11:45.370 --> 11:46.735
it's the truth.

11:46.770 --> 11:49.762
Well, I don't know
what to say.

11:49.810 --> 11:52.005
What would you say
to Spencer?

11:54.240 --> 11:56.105
She was almost
In this room.

11:57.850 --> 12:00.410
I know what people
think about me.

12:03.520 --> 12:06.318
And I know it's hard
to change someone's mind

12:06.350 --> 12:07.908
once it's made up.

12:10.190 --> 12:11.987
But I have to try.

12:13.900 --> 12:16.095
Then you'll need
a very good coach.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.001
Mrs. Hastings?

12:25.310 --> 12:26.868
Will you do it?

12:28.810 --> 12:31.142
Will you be my coach?

12:36.250 --> 12:37.740
ANDREW:
Did you forget about me?

12:40.160 --> 12:41.787
Oh, my God, Andrew.

12:41.820 --> 12:43.253
We had a session scheduled
for tonight, didn't we?

12:43.290 --> 12:44.518
Yep.
Ah!

12:44.560 --> 12:46.357
I'm so sorry.
I totally spaced.

12:46.390 --> 12:47.357
Have you been waiting
out here long?

12:47.400 --> 12:48.924
No.

12:48.960 --> 12:50.518
Just long enough to start
Anna Karenina ,

12:50.570 --> 12:51.923
and finish it.

12:51.970 --> 12:52.561
( chuckles )

12:52.600 --> 12:54.033
Don't worry about it.

12:54.070 --> 12:56.493
The Cold War awaits.
Shall we get started?

12:56.540 --> 12:58.167
Andrew...
(sighs)

12:58.210 --> 13:02.203
I feel terrible
about flaking, but, um...

13:03.550 --> 13:05.506
can we just hold off
on the study sessions

13:05.550 --> 13:07.040
for a while, maybe?

13:07.080 --> 13:08.877
Okay.

13:08.920 --> 13:10.012
But if you're gonna
blow off studying,

13:10.050 --> 13:11.586
how about squeezing
in a movie?

13:11.620 --> 13:12.951
I got two tickets
to a screening of

13:12.990 --> 13:14.116
All the President's Men .

13:14.160 --> 13:15.115
Tonight?

13:15.160 --> 13:16.286
Tomorrow.

13:16.320 --> 13:18.151
At the art house
theater downtown.

13:18.190 --> 13:19.225
What do you say?

13:21.100 --> 13:24.297
Andrew, yeah,
I-- I'd like to.

13:24.330 --> 13:27.197
But is this a date?

13:27.240 --> 13:29.333
I don't know.
Is it?

13:29.370 --> 13:31.565
No, well, it can't be.

13:31.610 --> 13:34.170
I'm still sort of
seeIng Ezra.

13:34.210 --> 13:35.404
Sort of?

13:35.440 --> 13:36.475
No, I am.

13:36.510 --> 13:38.148
Sort of.

13:38.180 --> 13:39.943
Well, you seem less sure
about that than you did

13:39.980 --> 13:41.379
about the three branches
of government,

13:41.420 --> 13:43.479
but don't sweat it.

13:44.350 --> 13:46.113
We'll go as friends.

13:46.150 --> 13:47.356
Fnends.

13:47.390 --> 13:48.584
Study buddies.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.053
Besides, the movie
is about Watergate.

13:50.090 --> 13:52.126
So it's_ like a civics
and history lesson

13:52.160 --> 13:53.195
rolled into one.

13:53.230 --> 13:54.857
Mm,
sounds entertaining.

13:54.900 --> 13:56.458
You won't be sorry.

13:56.500 --> 13:58.991
It's a thriller about getting
messages from a shadowy figure

13:59.030 --> 14:01.339
who knows
everybody's secrets.

14:01.370 --> 14:02.337
It's a wild stuff,
right?

14:02.370 --> 14:05.339
Hmm.

14:05.370 --> 14:07.076
I'll see you later.
Bye.

14:21.020 --> 14:24.285
Sorry, I must have
the wrong apartment.

14:24.330 --> 14:25.388
Flat.

14:25.430 --> 14:26.579
What?

14:26.630 --> 14:28.154
Apartments are flats.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.292
Trucks are lorries.

14:29.330 --> 14:30.592
Sweaters are jumpers.

14:30.630 --> 14:32.393
And now that
we have all that sorted,

14:32.430 --> 14:33.397
you must be Spencer.

14:33.440 --> 14:34.589
I'm Colin.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.232
Wren and Melissa's
flatmate.

14:36.270 --> 14:37.237
Welcome to London.

14:37.270 --> 14:39.067
Thank you.

14:39.110 --> 14:42.238
I'm afraid I'll be playing your
host for the next 24 hours.

14:42.280 --> 14:45.272
Wren and Melissa won't be
back until tomorrow night.

14:45.310 --> 14:47.278
My sister
isn't even here?

14:47.320 --> 14:50.084
Wren's boss invited them
to his country home in Kent.

14:50.120 --> 14:53.658
I imagine after your flight
you're a bit peckish.

14:53.690 --> 14:56.989
How do you feel
about...

14:58.430 --> 14:59.624
stale biscuits?

14:59.660 --> 15:01.457
I stole these from
a child's lunchbox.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.263
I have 23 of them.

15:03.300 --> 15:06.394
Children,
not biscuits.

15:06.430 --> 15:09.263
Not my children,
students.

15:09.300 --> 15:10.460
Let's start over.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.159
It's okay.
I'm not hungry.

15:12.210 --> 15:14.371
It's quite a ways for you
to come for an interview.

15:14.410 --> 15:16.298
You must really have your
heart set on Oxford.

15:16.340 --> 15:18.649
Yeah, I do.

15:18.680 --> 15:20.045
Which college?

15:20.080 --> 15:21.274
What?

15:21.320 --> 15:24.949
There are 38 of them
within the University.

15:24.990 --> 15:28.585
Right, I'm interested
in a few of them actually.

15:28.620 --> 15:30.952
I'm sorry,
I can't access my data

15:30.990 --> 15:32.287
and I really have
to text my friends.

15:32.330 --> 15:34.025
Can you please help?

15:35.100 --> 15:37.421
At the risk of sounding
like a nosy git,

15:37.470 --> 15:39.722
may I suggest that in light
of your impending interview

15:39.770 --> 15:42.637
that you tuck away
your mobile

15:42.670 --> 15:44.638
and pick up
a course catalogue?

15:45.770 --> 15:47.579
Or you can tell me
to bugger off.

15:48.540 --> 15:50.076
Thank you.

16:25.510 --> 16:26.738
Hey.

16:26.780 --> 16:29.669
I'm just here to pick up
my last check.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.054
Are you going
on a trip?

16:33.090 --> 16:36.719
( scoffs )
Not exactly.

16:36.760 --> 16:39.752
After what you said,
I had a talk with Eric.

16:39.790 --> 16:42.020
A real talk.

16:42.060 --> 16:43.789
I was pretty open
with him

16:43.830 --> 16:48.665
and it didn't go
so well.

16:50.440 --> 16:52.658
We're separating.

16:52.710 --> 16:55.531
Talia, did I make you
have a conversation

16:55.580 --> 16:56.808
you weren't ready
to have?

16:56.840 --> 16:59.570
It was going to happen
sooner or later.

16:59.610 --> 17:01.475
So what are you
gonna do?

17:01.520 --> 17:04.239
Well, I booked a hotel over
by another catering gig.

17:04.290 --> 17:08.579
So as long as there's hot
water and clean sheets,

17:08.620 --> 17:10.349
I'll stay there
for a while.

17:10.390 --> 17:13.325
But after that?

17:13.360 --> 17:15.419
I don't know.

17:15.460 --> 17:18.099
Look, if you need a place to
stay for the next few days,

17:18.130 --> 17:19.358
you can crash
at my house.

17:19.400 --> 17:21.334
Your mom would be
okay with that?

17:21.370 --> 17:22.689
She's away.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.165
Thank you.

17:25.210 --> 17:27.269
Yeah,
that would be great.

17:27.310 --> 17:28.777
Yeah.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.472
Didn't you tell me
there's a way to see

17:36.520 --> 17:38.784
if someone's read the email
you sent them?

17:38.820 --> 17:40.515
Not if you didn't attach
the thing

17:40.560 --> 17:42.710
you need
to attach to do it.

17:42.760 --> 17:43.749
How do you know
I didn't?

17:43.790 --> 17:45.189
Did you?

17:47.830 --> 17:50.298
I sent my resume
for a few job openings.

17:50.330 --> 17:52.218
I haven't heard back
from any of them.

17:53.140 --> 17:54.789
( cell phone rings )

17:57.210 --> 17:59.064
I'm gonna take this
upstairs.

18:02.440 --> 18:03.577
g.“
a 8'1 3-
ggsxigg,‘
“2:232;

18:03.610 --> 18:04.838
Where have you been?

18:04.880 --> 18:06.302
I covered for you
in school, but--

18:06.350 --> 18:07.840
My brother is on
borrowed time, Hanna.

18:07.880 --> 18:09.848
I can't be sitting in
Spanish conjugating verbs.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.416
I really need
to talk to Cyrus.

18:11.450 --> 18:13.714
You think we're going to
find "A" through Cyrus?

18:13.760 --> 18:15.318
You're lucky if you
can even find Cyrus.

18:15.360 --> 18:16.315
I already did.

18:16.360 --> 18:18.658
So I went back to the diner
looking for a lead,

18:18.690 --> 18:20.123
and I found one.

18:20.160 --> 18:21.388
Turns out Hank Mahoney
is a regular

18:21.430 --> 18:22.692
and he works as a mechanic
at a garage

18:22.730 --> 18:24.197
like an hour
and a half away.

18:24.230 --> 18:25.629
Aria, you shouldn't
have done that.

18:25.670 --> 18:27.467
No, so when I got there,
the shop manager told me

18:27.500 --> 18:29.138
that Hank was injured while
he was working on a car.

18:29.170 --> 18:31.331
Stop saying Hank,
it's confusing.

18:31.370 --> 18:32.735
So where is Cyrus?

18:32.770 --> 18:34.670
He's being treated
at Taft Memorial Hospital.

18:34.710 --> 18:37.349
I called, but he can't have
visitors until tomorrow.

18:37.380 --> 18:38.870
Hanna, we need to go
down there and talk to him

18:38.910 --> 18:40.468
before he disappears
again.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.647
Wait, why are you willing
to go down this road

18:42.680 --> 18:44.910
with a guy who tried to
run you over with his hog?

18:44.950 --> 18:46.349
When Mike met up with him,
Cyrus admitted

18:46.390 --> 18:47.812
that he was paid
to set All up.

18:47.860 --> 18:49.589
So if we can just
talk to him again,

18:51.190 --> 18:52.259
into who
contacted him.

18:52.290 --> 18:53.552
Why would
he tell us now?

18:53.600 --> 18:54.828
Because
we'll ask nicely?

18:54.860 --> 18:56.225
Because we're
Willing to pay him.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.158
No. No.

18:57.200 --> 18:58.724
I'm not.
I'm sorry.

18:58.770 --> 19:01.238
Emily's already popping and
locking my way into college.

19:01.270 --> 19:02.498
Fine.

19:02.540 --> 19:04.269
All right, I'll-I'll figure
something out.

19:04.310 --> 19:05.766
But you have to
come with me.

19:05.810 --> 19:08.699
( sighs ) I don't think
that's a good idea.

19:08.740 --> 19:10.401
I mean, he's kind
of a scary guy.

19:10.450 --> 19:12.873
Yeah, well, he's also our
only link to the real "A."

19:17.490 --> 19:18.445
Spencer Hastings.

19:18.490 --> 19:19.809
Pleasure to meet you.

19:19.850 --> 19:20.953
Nonsense.

19:20.990 --> 19:22.355
The pleasure
is all mine.

19:22.390 --> 19:23.459
Please.

19:23.490 --> 19:24.525
Thank you.

19:25.430 --> 19:28.888
So tell me,
Miss Hastings.

19:28.930 --> 19:30.898
Why do you wish
to further your education

19:30.930 --> 19:32.420
away from the colonies?

19:33.840 --> 19:36.400
Well,
why stay in America?

19:36.440 --> 19:38.431
I believe it was
William Fulbright

19:38.470 --> 19:40.734
who said that
international education

19:40.780 --> 19:42.304
is our best opportunity

19:42.340 --> 19:44.479
to turn ideologies
into human aspirations.

19:45.310 --> 19:46.777
With that being said,

19:48.980 --> 19:50.845
in the
English-speaking world?

19:53.590 --> 19:54.750
Who are you again?

19:54.790 --> 19:56.212
_ We're
his cou5ins.

19:56.260 --> 19:58.319
You can't bring
those in.

19:58.360 --> 20:00.521
Both of you, use this
on your hands please.

20:00.560 --> 20:01.595
Front and back.

20:04.470 --> 20:05.368
Put these on.

20:05.400 --> 20:08.289
Are you sure that this
is really necessary?

20:08.340 --> 20:10.308
We're just gonna go
see him for a second.

20:10.340 --> 20:12.331
And that's all the time
you'll get.

20:12.370 --> 20:14.304
But I'm not going
to risk you giving him

20:14.340 --> 20:16.604
or any of the other
patients an infection.

20:17.850 --> 20:18.942
Burn unit?

20:18.980 --> 20:20.538
You didn't
tell me that.

20:20.580 --> 20:21.911
I-I didn't know.

20:21.950 --> 20:23.679
I thought he had
a broken leg or something.

20:23.720 --> 20:25.312
Excuse me?

20:25.350 --> 20:27.284
No net?
No Vi5it.

20:30.660 --> 20:37.862
( chatter)

20:41.940 --> 20:43.999
( can rolling )

21:27.680 --> 21:31.013
So the tailor looks at the pants
and says, "Euripides?"

21:31.050 --> 21:34.918
And the gentleman replies,
"Yes, Eumend-ides."

21:36.790 --> 21:38.382
Wow. ( laughs )

21:38.430 --> 21:40.022
I'm gonna need to add
that one to my repertoire

21:40.060 --> 21:41.857
of philosophical
knock-knock jokes.

21:41.900 --> 21:44.323
Well, it's a shame you're
not staying longer to meet

21:44.370 --> 21:45.496
Professor Heath.

21:45.530 --> 21:47.930
She teaches a course
on Mythology

21:47.970 --> 21:49.562
and Modern Literature
that I think

21:49.600 --> 21:51.363
you'd find
quite diverting.

21:51.410 --> 21:53.674
Uh, I would be happy
to write a note

21:53.710 --> 21:56.634
introducing myself to her
if you wouldn't mind--

21:56.680 --> 21:57.704
What is that?

21:59.910 --> 22:00.945
I, um...

22:00.980 --> 22:02.845
What have you
got in there?

22:02.880 --> 22:04.780
I, um...

22:04.820 --> 22:06.447
Is that...

22:10.690 --> 22:12.555
I-- I really don't know
how this happened.

22:12.590 --> 22:13.625
Um...

22:13.660 --> 22:15.628
I-- I need to wash
my hands.

22:15.660 --> 22:16.957
I'm sorry.

22:25.110 --> 22:27.670
* Ohohohoh ohohohoh

22:27.710 --> 22:31.077
* I can't remember
to forget you *

22:31.110 --> 22:34.568
* Ohohohoh ohohohoh

22:34.620 --> 22:37.987
* I keep forgetting
I should let you go *

22:38.020 --> 22:39.817
* But when you look at me

22:39.850 --> 22:44.423
* The only memory is us
kissing in the moonlight *

22:44.460 --> 22:48.658
* Ohohohoh ohohohoh

22:48.700 --> 22:52.022
* I can't remember
to forget you *

22:52.070 --> 22:55.460
* But when you look at me,
the only memory *

22:55.500 --> 22:58.037
* Is us kissing
in the moonlight *

22:58.070 --> 23:02.530
* Ohohohoh ohohohoh

23:02.580 --> 23:04.878
* I can't remember
to forget you *

23:04.910 --> 23:06.946
* I'd rob and I'd kill to...

23:06.980 --> 23:08.811
Wow.

23:08.850 --> 23:11.580
You're really good.

23:13.050 --> 23:16.053
I just came
to drop off your key.

23:17.190 --> 23:18.726
Guess you didn't get
my text.

23:18.760 --> 23:19.988
No.

23:20.030 --> 23:23.420
I was rehearsing
for this pageant thing.

23:23.470 --> 23:26.667
You don't sound
thrilled, why do it?

23:26.700 --> 23:29.498
I'm doing it
for a friend.

23:29.540 --> 23:31.064
To help her
win money.

23:31.940 --> 23:33.703
Sorry.
Don't buy it.

23:33.740 --> 23:35.173
What?

23:36.780 --> 23:38.441
I don't buy it.

23:38.480 --> 23:39.799
The way
you just danced?

23:39.850 --> 23:42.114
Nobody works that hard
for just the money.

23:42.150 --> 23:45.642
To get the money
I have to win it.

23:45.690 --> 23:47.908
It's not like
I can half-ass it.

23:47.960 --> 23:50.019
Okay.

23:50.060 --> 23:51.880
It's for Hanna.

23:51.930 --> 23:54.694
Emily,
it was a compliment.

23:56.230 --> 23:59.927
But, yeah, maybe
it's for me, too.

23:59.970 --> 24:01.460
I guess I just
never really saw you

24:01.500 --> 24:03.604
as the beauty
pageant type.

24:03.640 --> 24:04.607
( chuckles )

24:04.640 --> 24:05.231
I'm not.

24:05.270 --> 24:06.908
But that's part of it.

24:06.940 --> 24:11.172
You know, I-I keep thinking
ifI work hard and win this,

24:11.210 --> 24:12.541
then I'll know
I have it in me

24:12.580 --> 24:16.710
to take control
of my life.

24:18.990 --> 24:20.651
That must sound
pretty stupid.

24:20.690 --> 24:22.180
Not at all.

24:27.630 --> 24:29.689
* Keep him with me

24:29.730 --> 24:31.197
Come on.
What are you doing?

24:31.230 --> 24:32.766
You're gonna
dance with me.

24:32.800 --> 24:35.189
* I'd give my last dime
to hold *

25:03.330 --> 25:05.093
NURSE: Mr. Mahoney?

25:05.130 --> 25:06.791
You have visitors.

25:10.770 --> 25:14.900
Hey, Cyrus, we wanted
to come talk to you,

25:14.940 --> 25:17.841
but we didn't realize you'd
been in such a bad accident.

25:19.150 --> 25:20.549
I'm sorry.

25:23.120 --> 25:24.280
It's no accident.

25:24.320 --> 25:26.743
What do you mean?

25:26.790 --> 25:28.781
Wait, are you saying
someone did this to you?

25:34.230 --> 25:35.788
Cyrus,
what happened?

25:45.940 --> 25:46.964
Here.

26:01.960 --> 26:02.949
Carjack?

26:04.630 --> 26:06.621
Okay,
time to say goodbye.

26:15.740 --> 26:16.991
Can we just have
two more minutes?

26:17.040 --> 26:18.302
( phone vibrates )
I'm sorry.

26:18.340 --> 26:20.069
Please, two more minutes
is all we need.

26:20.110 --> 26:21.702
I'm not here
for your needs.

26:21.740 --> 26:23.799
My job is to take care
of your cousin.

26:23.850 --> 26:25.340
Well, he would want us
to stay longer.

26:25.380 --> 26:26.938
I understand.

26:26.980 --> 26:29.676
But what Mr. Mahoney
needs right now is rest.

26:29.720 --> 26:30.345
Spencer?

26:30.380 --> 26:31.779
Spencer, slow down.

26:31.820 --> 26:33.856
There was blood everywhere!
Okay?

26:33.890 --> 26:35.255
I threw out the purse,
but what if somebody finds it

26:35.290 --> 26:36.257
and they turn it in?

26:36.290 --> 26:37.257
Whose blood is it?

26:37.290 --> 26:38.689
I don't know.

26:38.730 --> 26:40.994
It's mine
or yours or Mona's?

26:41.030 --> 26:42.224
Oh, my God.

26:42.260 --> 26:43.818
I think
I'm going to be sick.

26:43.870 --> 26:45.667
Spencer, you really
need to calm down, okay?

26:45.700 --> 26:47.361
How?
Do you know what this means?

26:47.400 --> 26:48.765
It means that
"A" put it in my bag

26:48.800 --> 26:50.336
before I got
to the airport.

26:50.370 --> 26:51.359
If they had it found it
in the X-ray machine

26:51.410 --> 26:53.105
I would still be there.

26:53.140 --> 26:55.233
I would be getting grilled by
dozens of federal agents.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.702
But you're not.

26:56.740 --> 26:57.900
All right?
Luckily you found them.

26:57.950 --> 26:59.941
Aria, I'm freaking out,
okay?

26:59.980 --> 27:00.969
I want to come home.

27:01.020 --> 27:01.975
So come home, Spence.

27:02.020 --> 27:03.248
I can't.

27:03.280 --> 27:04.986
How am I supposed
to get on a plane?

27:05.020 --> 27:06.840
What if they find a pinky-toe
in my checked luggage?

27:06.890 --> 27:09.950
Well, apparently you're not
the only one being targeted.

27:09.990 --> 27:11.150
Why, what do you mean?

27:11.190 --> 27:13.181
"A" put Cyrus
in the hospital.

27:13.230 --> 27:14.219
And I'm guessing
it's punishment

27:14.260 --> 27:15.249
for meeting Mike.

27:15.300 --> 27:16.722
What? How?

27:16.760 --> 27:18.125
Yeah, it looks like
"A" hurt Cyrus

27:18.170 --> 27:19.990
and tried to make it
look like a carjacking.

27:20.030 --> 27:21.998
Aria, I really-- I can't be
hearing this right now.

27:22.040 --> 27:23.098
I'm sorry.
I...

27:23.140 --> 27:24.300
I know.
I'm sorry.

27:24.340 --> 27:25.432
I didn't mean to
make it worse.

27:25.470 --> 27:27.006
I don't know
what to do.

27:27.040 --> 27:28.268
HANNA: I'm just gonna
go back in there--

27:28.310 --> 27:30.403
Miss, you better
take a step back

27:30.440 --> 27:31.771
or I'm gonna
have to call security.

27:31.810 --> 27:33.675
Hey, Spencer,
I have to go.

27:37.450 --> 27:38.849
( cell phone rings )

27:47.330 --> 27:50.959
Step and back
and step and over.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.160
Turn.

27:52.200 --> 27:53.428
I can't do it.

27:53.470 --> 27:55.062
Yes, you can.
Okay, mirror me.

27:55.100 --> 27:56.328
Come on.

27:57.200 --> 27:58.861
Okay.

27:58.910 --> 28:02.300
Step and back
and step and over.

28:02.340 --> 28:03.705
Turn...

28:04.350 --> 28:05.749
drop.

28:11.020 --> 28:13.853
* I can't remember
to forget you *

28:19.830 --> 28:23.322
( sobs )

28:26.070 --> 28:27.867
Come on.

28:27.900 --> 28:31.939
* When you know it's time,
you dare to be free *

28:33.270 --> 28:38.207
* When you're here tomorrow
and lovin' me *

28:38.250 --> 28:42.744
* That's when you leave it

28:42.780 --> 28:47.012
* Leave it

28:50.860 --> 28:54.956
* When you plead to me,
but I'm not really there *

28:55.000 --> 28:58.788
* When I close my eyes to--

28:59.400 --> 29:01.391
Next time wear pants.

29:01.440 --> 29:04.102
( scoffs )
I could've taken her.

29:04.140 --> 29:05.368
No, you couldn't have.

29:05.410 --> 29:06.763
Well, you could have
distracted her.

29:06.810 --> 29:07.936
What do you want me to?
Juggle?

29:07.980 --> 29:09.208
Something!

29:09.240 --> 29:11.504
God, the prison guards
were less intimidating.

29:11.550 --> 29:13.506
I mean, I took one step
towards that room

29:13.550 --> 29:15.472
and she flew over
that desk like

29:15.520 --> 29:17.988
Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon.

29:18.020 --> 29:20.318
And meanwhile,
"A" is tying up loose ends

29:20.350 --> 29:22.159
and Cyrus
is one of them.

29:30.300 --> 29:32.268
Wait,
this "C" is a V.

29:32.300 --> 29:33.426
Look.
VVhat?

29:33.470 --> 29:35.392
It's not "carjack."

29:35.440 --> 29:37.169
We read it wrong.
It's "Varjack."

29:38.570 --> 29:40.401
Cyrus wasn't trying
to tell us what happened.

29:40.440 --> 29:42.135
He was trying to
tell us who did it.

29:42.180 --> 29:44.239
You think that "A" is going
by the name "Varjak?"

29:44.280 --> 29:45.838
Why not?

29:45.880 --> 29:47.472
I mean, Spencer always said
how Ali was obsessed

29:47.510 --> 29:49.114
with
Breakfast at Tiffany's .

29:49.150 --> 29:53.018
She turned into Holly
for that fake passport.

29:53.050 --> 29:55.883
Maybe "A" is taunting her
by being Paul Varjak.

29:55.920 --> 29:57.888
Cyrus spelled it wrong.

29:58.590 --> 30:00.057
That's awesome.

30:00.090 --> 30:01.125
Why is that awesome?

30:01.160 --> 30:02.889
It just means
he's a bad speller.

30:02.930 --> 30:05.421
Or it means that he's never
seen it written down.

30:05.470 --> 30:08.962
That "A" hasn't contacted him
through email or text.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.934
They spoke.

30:56.450 --> 30:58.042
Did you find a bedbug?

30:58.090 --> 31:00.411
No,
I'm just repacking.

31:00.450 --> 31:01.986
Can I, um, borrow
your laptop?

31:02.020 --> 31:03.248
I want to change
my flight.

31:03.290 --> 31:04.587
Just let me put
the food down.

31:04.630 --> 31:06.882
Actually, maybe
you could call me a cab.

31:06.930 --> 31:08.898
I want to go home,
tonight.

31:08.930 --> 31:11.069
Before your sister
returns?

31:11.100 --> 31:13.989
I just-- I just really
need to go home.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.439
Spencer?

31:16.470 --> 31:17.630
Hey, Spencer,
take a moment--

31:17.670 --> 31:18.967
Please,
I just need to pack.

31:19.010 --> 31:20.363
You're having
a panic attack.

31:20.410 --> 31:21.638
No, this is just what
it looks like when I pack.

31:21.680 --> 31:22.977
What happened?

31:23.010 --> 31:24.170
Will you get out
of my way?

31:24.210 --> 31:25.279
Hey!

31:27.580 --> 31:29.912
I teach primary school,
and when one of my kids

31:29.950 --> 31:31.417
is having
a bit of a day

31:31.450 --> 31:32.610
because a girl
won't share her crayons

31:32.650 --> 31:35.050
or a boy ate
the color blue,

31:35.090 --> 31:36.978
I take them through
a relaxation exercise.

31:37.020 --> 31:38.419
Look, I didn't eat
a crayon, okay?

31:38.460 --> 31:39.586
I'm just dealing with

31:39.630 --> 31:41.257
overs_ized toiletries
right now.

31:41.300 --> 31:42.255
Humor me.

31:42.300 --> 31:43.653
Close your eyes.

31:43.700 --> 31:45.691
( Spencer breathing hard )

31:45.730 --> 31:47.618
Focus on your breath.

31:49.170 --> 31:52.662
Imagine the breath going
deep into your belly,

31:52.710 --> 31:55.270
surrounding all that
nervous energy...

31:57.540 --> 31:59.098
and letting it out.

32:03.990 --> 32:05.582
Do you want to
talk about it?

32:08.460 --> 32:09.449
No.

32:09.490 --> 32:11.151
Okay.

32:16.300 --> 32:17.722
Well, then can you
at least leave the bedbugs

32:17.760 --> 32:19.990
and let me make you
something to eat?

32:25.170 --> 32:26.137
Emily.

32:26.170 --> 32:27.501
Hi, Claire.

32:27.540 --> 32:29.030
I stopped
by your work.

32:29.080 --> 32:30.308
They told me you were
rehearsing here.

32:30.340 --> 32:33.377
Yeah. My routine
for the competition.

32:35.280 --> 32:36.474
Is everything okay?

32:36.520 --> 32:37.578
My mom said that
she sent over the--

32:37.620 --> 32:38.712
No,
I got her signature.

32:38.750 --> 32:41.287
That isn't why
I'm here.

32:41.320 --> 32:43.982
Emily, when you filled
out the application,

32:44.030 --> 32:46.351
did you read
the entire thing?

32:46.390 --> 32:47.687
Yeah, I mean...

32:47.730 --> 32:50.051
I think so, except
for the permission part.

32:50.100 --> 32:53.092
The application form
explicitly mentions

32:53.130 --> 32:57.294
that all contestants must be
of good moral character.

32:59.370 --> 33:00.359
Um...

33:01.380 --> 33:02.733
I'm not following.

33:02.780 --> 33:05.078
You should have at least
mentioned it to me.

33:05.110 --> 33:07.169
You must've known
you would make the board

33:07.210 --> 33:10.475
apprehensive by you
participating as a contestant.

33:10.520 --> 33:11.714
More than apprehensive.

33:11.750 --> 33:13.741
Are you forcing me
to drop out?

33:13.790 --> 33:16.418
We can't force you
to do anything.

33:16.460 --> 33:17.609
Only encourage you.

33:17.660 --> 33:19.321
You don't want me
in the pageant

33:19.360 --> 33:20.384
because of who I date?

33:20.430 --> 33:22.022
Are you serious?

33:22.060 --> 33:24.221
This is about your
close connection

33:24.270 --> 33:26.022
to the Alison DiLaurentis
case.

33:26.070 --> 33:29.665
The board is concerned
that if you participate,

33:29.700 --> 33:31.236
our sponsors
will drop out

33:31.270 --> 33:33.409
to avoid _ _
any negative assoaation.

33:37.580 --> 33:38.547
Hey.

33:38.580 --> 33:39.774
Hey, sweetie.

33:39.810 --> 33:42.347
Did you hear back
about a job?

33:42.380 --> 33:44.746
No, not yet.

33:46.690 --> 33:48.089
Ted called.

33:50.320 --> 33:53.426
We went for a walk
and talked

33:53.460 --> 33:54.757
and...

33:54.800 --> 33:56.392
the rest is history.

33:58.170 --> 33:59.319
Wow.

34:00.430 --> 34:01.795
Okay.

34:01.840 --> 34:03.831
That response really
put the "luke" in lukewarm.

34:03.870 --> 34:06.031
No I'm,
I'm happy for you.

34:06.670 --> 34:08.331
I'm confused.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.530
Aren't you the one who
convinced me to go back to Ted

34:10.580 --> 34:12.275
and ask
for his forgiveness?

34:12.310 --> 34:13.709
I know.

34:13.750 --> 34:15.172
Ijust...

34:16.280 --> 34:17.679
I don't think it's fair
that he made you

34:17.720 --> 34:19.347
twist in the wind
for so long.

34:19.390 --> 34:20.789
Hanna”.

34:23.290 --> 34:26.327
I'm glad that he took the time
to think about it.

34:27.460 --> 34:31.419
If he'd just said
"okay" right away,

34:31.470 --> 34:33.267
that wouldn't
have been honest.

34:34.340 --> 34:36.797
He needed to come to it
on his own time.

34:38.340 --> 34:40.103
Well, didn't that make you
sort of wish

34:40.140 --> 34:41.698
you hadn't apologized?

34:41.740 --> 34:43.731
No.

34:44.750 --> 34:46.570
I feel awful
about what I did,

34:46.610 --> 34:48.771
and I needed
to say that.

34:48.820 --> 34:50.708
Not only for him
to forgive me,

34:50.750 --> 34:53.446
but for me
to forgive myself.

34:57.320 --> 34:59.220
I really am fine.

35:00.160 --> 35:02.299
Thank you
for everything.

35:02.330 --> 35:03.456
Of course.

35:10.640 --> 35:11.834
Talia?

35:11.870 --> 35:12.837
What are you doing?

35:12.870 --> 35:14.838
Just trust me, okay?

35:14.880 --> 35:16.609
I followed your lead,
now you follow mine.

35:16.640 --> 35:17.800
Miss Handelman?

35:17.840 --> 35:19.341
Oh.
I've really got to get going.

35:19.380 --> 35:21.473
Uh, Emily
just wanted you to know

35:21.520 --> 35:23.909
that she understands
the board's position.

35:23.950 --> 35:26.339
Well, I'm sorry it had
to come down to this.

35:26.390 --> 35:27.414
Me, too.

35:27.450 --> 35:31.227
Uh, we're just concerned
that if anyone found out

35:31.260 --> 35:32.488
you wanted her
to drop out

35:32.530 --> 35:34.350
because of a friendship
she has--

35:34.400 --> 35:36.755
That friend is on trial
for murder.

35:36.800 --> 35:38.392
But in this country,

35:38.430 --> 35:40.193
you're innocent
until proven guilty.

35:40.230 --> 35:43.199
Unless the pageant judges
know better than the ones

35:43.240 --> 35:44.332
on the Supreme Court.

35:44.370 --> 35:46.235
Are you
threatening me?

35:46.270 --> 35:48.409
I'm encouraging you.

35:49.840 --> 35:52.206
Perhaps your sponsors
could make a donation

35:52.250 --> 35:54.172
_ toward _
Emily's education.

36:06.430 --> 36:09.627
Did you seriously just ask her
to send me a check?

36:09.660 --> 36:11.196
They're not going
to do that.

36:12.500 --> 36:13.797
You never know.

36:18.940 --> 36:20.430
HANNA: ( on phone )
Did you talk to Mike?

36:20.470 --> 36:21.937
Does he have any idea
who Varjak is?

36:21.980 --> 36:24.642
Uh, I can't find Mike.

36:24.680 --> 36:26.443
He might be at a game.

36:26.480 --> 36:29.472
I'm looking
for his schedule right now.

36:31.850 --> 36:33.613
Han, I'm gonna
call you back.

36:35.320 --> 36:37.515
ANDREW:
Aria? You home?

36:37.560 --> 36:38.959
Yeah, I'm up here.

36:51.740 --> 36:53.401
Ow.

36:55.010 --> 36:56.705
What happened?

36:56.740 --> 36:57.707
Are you okay?

36:57.740 --> 36:59.605
Yeah.

37:00.710 --> 37:02.416
Ow!

37:02.450 --> 37:06.580
Yeah, I was just standing
on that thing and it broke. Ow.

37:10.560 --> 37:11.652
That's weird.

37:12.660 --> 37:13.854
What?

37:13.890 --> 37:15.596
The nut and bolt
don't match.

37:16.900 --> 37:18.424
If your brother
had been on this,

37:18.470 --> 37:20.495
the weights would have
crushed his skull.

37:49.560 --> 37:51.664
This hurt?

37:51.700 --> 37:53.759
Yeah, a little.

37:53.800 --> 37:55.768
I don't think
it's broken,

37:55.800 --> 37:58.360
but you might have
a sprain.

37:58.410 --> 38:00.935
What were you doing
on top of that thing anyway?

38:02.340 --> 38:03.500
I was just
grabbing something

38:03.540 --> 38:04.643
from the board
up there.

38:04.680 --> 38:05.942
See?

38:05.980 --> 38:07.402
That's why we need
to hang out more.

38:07.450 --> 38:10.044
I'm basically
a human stepladder.

38:10.080 --> 38:13.413
You know,
for such a petite girl,

38:13.450 --> 38:15.418
you bring
a lot of chaos.

38:15.460 --> 38:18.054
It's not that I mind
chasing down angry bikers

38:18.090 --> 38:20.786
with a baseball bat,
'cause, I mean, I don't.

38:20.830 --> 38:22.058
I like problems.

38:22.100 --> 38:24.989
Math equations,
jigsaw puzzles,

38:25.030 --> 38:26.793
complicated girls,

38:26.830 --> 38:28.468
they don't scare me.

38:28.500 --> 38:32.106
But whatdoes scare me
is this swelling.

38:32.140 --> 38:34.506
We might need to get
a doctor to look at this.

38:35.580 --> 38:36.604
Hey.

38:36.640 --> 38:38.346
It's okay.

38:39.710 --> 38:41.348
Here.
Go to town.

38:43.480 --> 38:45.016
It's okay.

39:20.150 --> 39:22.584
Spencer, call me
as soon as you get this.

39:22.620 --> 39:24.759
I want you to cancel
your flight home.

39:32.900 --> 39:34.538
( buzzing )

39:53.450 --> 39:55.589
I brought you
some magazines.

39:56.190 --> 39:58.750
But they took them.

39:59.960 --> 40:01.951
Yeah, um...

40:02.000 --> 40:03.490
You have to go
through the canteen.

40:03.530 --> 40:06.124
Yeah,
they told me.

40:06.170 --> 40:07.660
I'll do that.

40:15.480 --> 40:17.573
Ali, I've been thinking
about what I said to you.

40:17.610 --> 40:19.805
Hanna, please
don't apologize.

40:21.750 --> 40:23.911
When I first got here,

40:23.950 --> 40:26.145
I kept thinking,

40:26.190 --> 40:28.044
"How did this happen?

40:29.960 --> 40:32.121
What did I do
to deserve this?"

40:33.930 --> 40:36.694
I honestly thought
that I was helping you guys.

40:38.060 --> 40:40.062
Telling you
what to wear,

40:40.100 --> 40:42.830
how to act,
who to like.

40:45.170 --> 40:47.104
And when you stopped
listening,

40:47.140 --> 40:49.199
I found new people
who would.

40:52.010 --> 40:53.875
Being here?

40:55.780 --> 40:57.577
No one listens to me.

40:59.220 --> 41:01.950
I can't even decide

41:01.990 --> 41:03.855
what to wear,
what to eat...

41:06.890 --> 41:08.619
and when to shower.

41:10.130 --> 41:12.121
I'm told everything.

41:13.100 --> 41:14.795
Everything's an order.

41:15.900 --> 41:19.006
I never realized

41:19.040 --> 41:21.975
how bad that felt,

41:22.010 --> 41:24.103
to be on
the other side of that.

41:24.140 --> 41:27.143
So I'm sorry.

41:34.760 --> 41:36.853
Do you think that
we could start over?

41:40.860 --> 41:42.498
I don't know.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.820
But we could try.

41:50.870 --> 41:53.907
But only if you're
honest with us...

41:53.940 --> 41:55.669
about everything.

41:59.580 --> 42:00.774
Okay.

42:01.920 --> 42:03.649
Alison?

42:05.350 --> 42:07.181
Who is Varjak?
