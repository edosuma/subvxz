MAN WITH A PLAN #210
"We Can Be Heroes"
Closed Captioned

00:03.137 --> 00:04.372
What happened to donuts?

00:04.405 --> 00:06.540
This thing is mostly hole.

00:06.574 --> 00:08.776
I think they're making
the middle bigger.

00:08.809 --> 00:11.045
I bought a dozen donuts
and a dozen donut holes.

00:11.079 --> 00:13.181
They don't match up.
Somebody's getting rich.

00:13.214 --> 00:15.449
Huh.

00:15.483 --> 00:17.185
Hey, there they are.

00:17.218 --> 00:18.786
How'd the, uh,
doctors appointments go?

00:18.819 --> 00:22.090
Turns out Teddy needs
glasses, like, a lot.

00:22.123 --> 00:25.293
The doctor was
pretty judgmental.

00:25.326 --> 00:26.727
I got, like,
six lollipops.

00:26.760 --> 00:29.663
I got nothing
because I'm perfect.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.031
Aw.

00:32.100 --> 00:33.301
Well, don't worry
about it, buddy.

00:33.334 --> 00:36.237
We'll get it handled.
Go get a snack.

00:36.270 --> 00:38.206
He needs glasses.

00:38.239 --> 00:40.741
That explains so much.

00:40.774 --> 00:43.711
Also, Katie needs braces.

00:43.744 --> 00:45.813
Ugh, I'm gonna
look so dorky.

00:45.846 --> 00:47.815
Can I please get
the plastic invisible ones?

00:47.848 --> 00:49.217
I don't see why not.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.284
They're $6,000.

00:50.318 --> 00:52.220
I see exactly why not.

00:52.253 --> 00:54.255
Great.
Well, I'll have metal mouth.

00:54.288 --> 00:56.324
Guess you can use my face
to open your beers.

00:56.357 --> 00:58.492
That's the spirit.

01:00.361 --> 01:02.163
Braces and glasses.
Yeah.

01:02.196 --> 01:04.265
You're gonna need
some quick cash.
Yeah.

01:04.298 --> 01:05.799
Well, I've got an idea.

01:05.833 --> 01:08.269
How would you feel
about taking a tumble

01:08.302 --> 01:10.271
down the escalator
at the mall?

01:10.304 --> 01:12.540
I know a guy.
He can push you.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.142
You don't even
need the courage.

01:14.175 --> 01:16.377
We'll be fine.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.146
We have insurance.

01:18.179 --> 01:20.414
But you came up with that
escalator thing pretty quick.

01:20.448 --> 01:22.816
Next time we go to the mall,
you're walking in front.

01:25.886 --> 01:26.920
Look at this.

01:26.954 --> 01:30.191
Our insurance only gives us
$30 for Teddy's glasses.

01:30.224 --> 01:31.692
Where are we supposed
to buy them?

01:31.725 --> 01:33.727
The spinny thing
at the drugstore?

01:33.761 --> 01:36.597
Well, the drugstore
has good stuff.

01:36.630 --> 01:39.367
That's where I get
my sexy sweatpants you like.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.703
And check this out.

01:42.736 --> 01:44.438
The deductible
for Katie's braces

01:44.472 --> 01:46.340
is more than the cost
of the actual braces.

01:46.374 --> 01:48.242
Well, they do
cover leg braces.

01:50.511 --> 01:53.781
Might as well get her those
if they're giving them away.

01:53.814 --> 01:55.716
Ugh, we can't
afford all this.

01:55.749 --> 01:57.651
Ugh.
Well, the orthodontist
has financing.

01:57.685 --> 01:59.453
He gave me a brochure,

01:59.487 --> 02:03.191
but I dropped it when Teddy
walked into the fish tank.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.492
He really can't see.

02:04.525 --> 02:06.427
We should be ashamed
of ourselves.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.229
The Burns men
don't do financing.

02:08.262 --> 02:09.730
You end up paying triple.

02:09.763 --> 02:11.599
Be cheaper to just
send Katie to England

02:11.632 --> 02:13.667
to live with the rest
of the snaggle-toothers.

02:15.969 --> 02:19.573
Well, we have to find
the money somewhere.

02:20.874 --> 02:24.378
Maybe we should go to the mall
and talk about it.

02:24.412 --> 02:28.482
I'm not falling down
an escalator, Andi.

02:28.516 --> 02:31.185
Why not?
You fall off stuff all the time.

02:31.219 --> 02:32.686
Let's start making some money.

02:38.292 --> 02:40.361
Hey, pretty lady.

02:41.429 --> 02:43.197
I'm wearing my drugstore sweats.

02:43.231 --> 02:45.266
Let's get crazy.

02:45.299 --> 02:49.603
You know what's crazy is
how tight our budget already is.

02:49.637 --> 02:52.273
So fooling around is out?

02:52.306 --> 02:54.808
Okay, let's talk money.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.610
What's in our
rainy day fund?

02:56.644 --> 02:58.679
$175. Yeah.

02:58.712 --> 02:59.947
Which one of Kate's teeth

02:59.980 --> 03:01.749
would you like
to straighten with that?

03:01.782 --> 03:04.752
I thought we agreed to keep
that tone out of the bedroom.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.920
Okay, well, I printed out
our budget.

03:06.954 --> 03:09.690
And, uh, this page
is our necessities.

03:09.723 --> 03:11.925
You know, mortgage,
groceries, stuff like that.

03:11.959 --> 03:14.662
And this page
is our extras.

03:14.695 --> 03:18.399
And, um, your cable
sports packages

03:18.432 --> 03:19.967
seem to be our
biggest extra.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.836
Hold on. No sex, no sports?

03:22.870 --> 03:24.772
I'm sorry I even came in here.

03:24.805 --> 03:27.541
I'm not giving up
my sports packages.

03:27.575 --> 03:29.543
Adam, you bought,
like, eight of them.

03:29.577 --> 03:31.779
I mean, you shouldn't have more
sports channels than children.

03:31.812 --> 03:33.781
Then let's have
more children.

03:33.814 --> 03:36.317
No. Forget I said that.

03:36.350 --> 03:38.319
Look, Andi,
these sports packages

03:38.352 --> 03:40.588
are the only thing I have left
that makes me happy.

03:40.621 --> 03:43.324
Well, besides you and the kids.
Blah, blah, blah.

03:43.357 --> 03:44.992
Look, I know
you love them,

03:45.025 --> 03:47.461
but I-I-I think
they have to go.

03:47.495 --> 03:50.331
The kids? Okay.

03:50.364 --> 03:52.566
But wait a minute, hold on.
What about your extras?

03:52.600 --> 03:54.001
Maybe we can get rid
of one of those.

03:54.034 --> 03:55.936
No, I don't have
any extras.

03:55.969 --> 03:58.339
I already gave them
all up for the family.

03:58.372 --> 04:00.341
Oh.

04:00.374 --> 04:02.876
Then I guess there's
no coming back from that.

04:02.910 --> 04:06.647
Fine, okay.
I'll cancel my sports packages.

04:06.680 --> 04:09.917
I know it hurts, honey, but
you're doing the right thing.

04:09.950 --> 04:12.620
If it helps,
you're kind of being a hero.

04:12.653 --> 04:14.922
A hero, huh?

04:14.955 --> 04:16.390
That does help.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.293
Hero. As in...

04:19.327 --> 04:22.296
I'd like to dedicate
this Nobel Prize to my father,

04:22.330 --> 04:24.031
Adam Burns, the real hero.

04:24.064 --> 04:26.400
Whatever gets you there, babe.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.570
Ugh, the only thing is

04:29.603 --> 04:31.439
I don't know how
I'm gonna tell the guys.

04:31.472 --> 04:33.073
They love coming over here
to watch the games.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.643
Our house is where
Pittsburgh comes to play.

04:35.676 --> 04:39.513
I know, honey,
but I guess from now on,

04:39.547 --> 04:41.815
Pittsburgh's just gonna
have to play with itself.

04:43.884 --> 04:47.321
I know how
Pittsburgh feels.

04:47.355 --> 04:49.690
*

04:58.566 --> 04:59.933
(sportscast playing,
men groaning)

04:59.967 --> 05:02.503
Okay, I know this is your
last sports package game,

05:02.536 --> 05:04.972
but on the upside,
I made mini pizzas.

05:06.907 --> 05:09.877
I'm torn. I'm mad at you
for taking away our sports,

05:09.910 --> 05:12.380
but I'm impressed
by these tiny pepperonis.

05:12.413 --> 05:14.782
What did you use,
a hole punch?

05:14.815 --> 05:16.550
I just nibbled them
down to size.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.523
Man, this stinks.

05:22.556 --> 05:24.925
If I'm not here watching
the game, I have to go home.

05:24.958 --> 05:26.794
That's where my wife lives.

05:29.062 --> 05:31.532
This is our time
and Andi took it.

05:31.565 --> 05:32.833
I fought hard
to get in here.

05:32.866 --> 05:34.868
I'm not gonna lose it just
because you took a vow

05:34.902 --> 05:36.737
with some hussy
you met in a bar.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.005
Look, I know it's tough,

05:38.038 --> 05:40.140
but some situations
call for a hero,

05:40.173 --> 05:41.809
a man who's
willing to step up

05:41.842 --> 05:43.544
and do what's right
for his family.

05:43.577 --> 05:44.878
Well, can you
find that guy

05:44.912 --> 05:47.448
and ask him to bring me
a regular size pizza?

05:50.418 --> 05:52.386
Okay, Dad, you and Mom
were always on a budget.

05:52.420 --> 05:54.688
How did you pay for stuff when
Don and I were growing up?

05:54.722 --> 05:57.057
Well, we just chose the kid
with the most potential

05:57.090 --> 06:00.461
and spent
our resources on him.

06:00.494 --> 06:03.597
In our case,
that was Donny.

06:03.631 --> 06:04.598
Thanks, Pop.

06:04.632 --> 06:07.000
You chose him?

06:07.034 --> 06:08.769
Well, he seemed
like the better bet.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.504
He was bigger
and he talked more.

06:10.538 --> 06:15.609
You just sat there chewing
on your fist like an apple.

06:15.643 --> 06:17.010
I was a baby.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.012
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

06:19.046 --> 06:20.714
Is that why I always
got cheese sandwiches

06:20.748 --> 06:21.849
and he got bologna?

06:21.882 --> 06:23.484
Exactly. And it worked.

06:23.517 --> 06:26.754
Look how tall he is,
like a redwood.

06:26.787 --> 06:29.523
I am majestic.
Thanks again, Pop.

06:31.224 --> 06:34.027
I could never do
that with my kids.

06:34.061 --> 06:36.163
Andi wouldn't let me.

06:36.196 --> 06:38.131
Listen, if you want
your sports back,

06:38.165 --> 06:40.067
you better cut something else
from this budget.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.069
Where did you get that?

06:42.102 --> 06:44.171
I took the long way
to the bathroom.

06:44.204 --> 06:47.074
Folder said "private."
Got me interested.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.512
Who's Josephine?

06:51.545 --> 06:52.780
Give me that.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.784
Wow. Who is Josephine?

06:56.817 --> 06:58.886
She costs a fortune.
No, no, no, no.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.654
You don't need to look
at that. You don't...

07:00.688 --> 07:02.022
Just enjoy your pizzas.

07:02.055 --> 07:04.091
I ate two pounds of
pepperoni for those.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.728
Tell me who Josephine is.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.797
She's my hairdresser.

07:09.830 --> 07:12.032
Yeah. Josephine
makes my hair all,

07:12.065 --> 07:16.136
you know, silky and, you
know, all this one color.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.442
I could do that for free.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.745
Strip it, prime it, paint it.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.680
I've done it a million times.

07:27.715 --> 07:29.750
Wait, why did you put

07:29.783 --> 07:32.185
your hair salon
under necessities?

07:32.219 --> 07:33.721
So you wouldn't see it.

07:33.754 --> 07:34.988
Yeah.

07:35.022 --> 07:36.256
See, I showed
you the extras

07:36.289 --> 07:37.858
and then I held back
the necessities.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.860
It was all very
well thought-out.

07:39.893 --> 07:41.795
So you're just
shuffling cash around?

07:41.829 --> 07:43.163
That's money laundering.

07:44.197 --> 07:46.900
You rigged this whole thing.
Rigged!

07:46.934 --> 07:48.936
You know, there's no cheaper way
to see my game.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.003
None!

07:50.037 --> 07:52.205
But you could easily find
a bargain hair place.

07:52.239 --> 07:53.641
Do it!

07:55.876 --> 07:58.178
All right, Lowell,
I can handle this.

07:58.211 --> 08:00.213
Then handle it, man.

08:06.286 --> 08:07.588
What's with him?

08:07.621 --> 08:09.489
I don't know.
He had a wine spritzer.

08:10.891 --> 08:13.861
Look, honey, Josephine
is a necessity.

08:13.894 --> 08:15.596
All right? It's not
just a haircut.

08:15.629 --> 08:17.865
She rubs my shoulders.
She listens to me vent.

08:17.898 --> 08:20.100
You know that-that time
with her, it keeps me going.

08:20.133 --> 08:22.135
It's my last happy thing.

08:22.169 --> 08:25.272
It... besides you and the
kids and blah, blah, blah.

08:25.305 --> 08:27.875
Well, that's how I feel
about my sports.

08:27.908 --> 08:30.277
It's a few hours a week
where I don't have to worry

08:30.310 --> 08:32.279
about all the stuff
I have to worry about.

08:32.312 --> 08:36.116
For example, you keeping
two sets of books like the mob.

08:36.149 --> 08:39.620
Well, I don't want to
give up my one last thing.

08:39.653 --> 08:41.622
Well, I don't want
to give up mine, either.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.991
Well, look, one if us gonna
have to bite the bullet.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.092
You're right.

08:45.125 --> 08:48.261
I think I know a way
we can settle this like adults.

08:48.295 --> 08:49.262
Then settle it.

08:49.296 --> 08:51.832
All right. Lowell.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.201
You're gonna have to go
take a walk or something.

09:00.340 --> 09:01.274
Okay, what's your plan?

09:01.308 --> 09:02.710
How are we gonna settle
this like adults?

09:02.743 --> 09:04.211
Rock, paper, scissors.

09:04.244 --> 09:05.813
Ready?
Yeah.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.314
BOTH:
One, two...
Wait, wait, wait.

09:07.347 --> 09:09.116
I want this to be fair.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.719
So, I have to tell you,
I know you're gonna do rock.

09:11.752 --> 09:12.986
You always do rock.

09:13.020 --> 09:15.989
Well, that's because I disagree
that anything could beat rock.

09:16.023 --> 09:17.190
Paper beats rock.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.192
Okay, you throw
a piece of paper at me,

09:19.226 --> 09:22.062
I'll throw a rock at you,
let's see who's happier.

09:22.095 --> 09:24.798
Okay, forget I said
anything. Ready?

09:24.832 --> 09:26.133
BOTH:
One, two...
Wait, wait, wait.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.735
Okay, now that you know
I'm gonna throw rock,

09:27.768 --> 09:28.869
I'm gonna change it.

09:28.902 --> 09:32.606
So you're still going with rock?

09:32.640 --> 09:34.708
Well, that was the plan,
but I'm really gonna change it.

09:34.742 --> 09:36.810
Okay, here we go.

09:36.844 --> 09:38.345
Winner keeps
their favorite thing.

09:38.378 --> 09:39.980
Loser gives it up.

09:40.013 --> 09:41.982
BOTH:
One, two, three, shoot.

09:42.015 --> 09:44.752
That's what
I'm talking about.

09:44.785 --> 09:46.253
Paper crushes rock.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.856
I double outsmarted you.
Right
I know.

09:48.889 --> 09:51.224
I had a good 15-year
winning streak there,

09:51.258 --> 09:55.162
but you got me, so I will
cancel my hair place.

09:58.031 --> 10:01.101
Are you gonna be generous
and classy about this?

10:01.134 --> 10:02.970
Yeah.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.838
Well, it's no fun
to beat someone

10:04.872 --> 10:06.373
who's generous and classy.

10:06.406 --> 10:09.710
Aw, all right, all right, look.
How about this?

10:09.743 --> 10:11.779
How about if we both
give up our favorite thing?

10:11.812 --> 10:13.647
Really?

10:13.681 --> 10:15.382
Hey, the only way
we can both be happy

10:15.415 --> 10:16.884
is if we're both unhappy.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.719
Right?

10:18.752 --> 10:21.021
That's what marriage is.

10:21.054 --> 10:24.191
Got to say, I'm impressed.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.726
Yeah?
Hmm.

10:25.759 --> 10:28.028
Well, you should be.
I mean, most people,

10:28.061 --> 10:30.430
they have to read
about what a hero does.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.800
But you, you're getting
to see it firsthand.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.302
You're... you're
a lucky lady.

10:39.439 --> 10:41.675
What are you watching?

10:41.709 --> 10:43.076
Well, all the sports
are gone

10:43.110 --> 10:44.812
so I'm watching
The Weather Channel.

10:46.379 --> 10:49.817
San Diego's beating Buffalo
by 60 degrees.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.419
Hey, buddy.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.054
Now that you got
your new glasses,

10:54.087 --> 10:55.889
let me try something.

10:55.923 --> 10:56.957
Catch.

10:58.091 --> 11:00.894
I knew you could do that!

11:00.928 --> 11:03.030
I'm good at stuff!

11:05.165 --> 11:07.200
Well, hopefully he can
hit the toilet now.

11:10.137 --> 11:11.204
Hey, honey.

11:13.874 --> 11:15.208
What's wrong?

11:15.242 --> 11:17.177
I went to Jiffy Cuts.

11:17.210 --> 11:18.712
Huh?

11:18.746 --> 11:20.180
And this happened.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.317
Oh, boy.

11:24.351 --> 11:27.220
My new hairdresser,
whose name is Cricket,

11:27.254 --> 11:30.323
was texting her boyfriend,
whose name is Sledge.

11:30.357 --> 11:34.127
This country is doomed.

11:34.161 --> 11:37.097
She was distracted,
so instead of using brown dye,

11:37.130 --> 11:38.231
she used bleach.

11:38.265 --> 11:40.267
Oh, but...

11:40.300 --> 11:43.003
the good news is that while
she was shampooing my hair,

11:43.036 --> 11:45.072
her nose ring
fell into my mouth.

11:48.842 --> 11:51.845
Sounds like you had
a jam-packed morning.

11:53.180 --> 11:54.481
But didn't it feel good
to save money?

11:54.514 --> 11:55.883
Huh? Come on.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.217
It's for the kids.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.219
Oh, you're right.
You're right.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.955
This is, this is all so Katie
can have straight teeth.

12:01.989 --> 12:03.356
Yeah, and Teddy,
with his new glasses,

12:03.390 --> 12:05.358
I threw him the ball
and he caught it.

12:05.392 --> 12:06.726
And not with his face.

12:07.895 --> 12:09.797
We're doing great things here.

12:09.830 --> 12:10.831
Yes, we are.

12:10.864 --> 12:13.100
It's all worth it.
Yeah.

12:13.133 --> 12:15.335
And we can save even more money
on Halloween.

12:15.368 --> 12:16.469
Huh?

12:16.503 --> 12:18.105
Do you need to buy a costume?

12:18.138 --> 12:20.740
No, you're already wearing it
on your head.

12:28.281 --> 12:29.883
Hey.

12:33.453 --> 12:35.122
What's going on?

12:35.155 --> 12:37.257
We're having
an intervention.
Wha...?

12:37.290 --> 12:39.292
You let Andi
take away our sports.

12:39.326 --> 12:41.394
You never handled it, man.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.864
I blame myself.

12:43.897 --> 12:46.133
Maybe if you'd had a
little bologna as a kid,

12:46.166 --> 12:47.868
you could stand up
to your wife.

12:47.901 --> 12:50.971
Okay, look,
this is hard on me, too.

12:51.004 --> 12:53.106
That was my thing,
my very last thing,

12:53.140 --> 12:55.275
but I told Andi I'd give it up.

12:55.308 --> 12:56.509
But she played dirty.

12:56.543 --> 12:58.278
She didn't even tell you
about her hair lady.

12:58.311 --> 12:59.512
That's true.

12:59.546 --> 13:01.281
And who won rock,
paper, scissors?

13:01.314 --> 13:03.016
I did.

13:03.050 --> 13:05.185
I double outsmarted her.

13:05.218 --> 13:08.021
Did you?

13:08.055 --> 13:11.091
But now I'm stuck watching
cooking shows with Marcy.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.260
I'm real sad, brother.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.862
You hear that?

13:14.895 --> 13:16.163
Do something, boy.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.365
You just made a
mighty redwood cry.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.506
Teddy, where are your glasses?

13:29.242 --> 13:31.044
I lost them.

13:31.078 --> 13:32.112
Already?

13:32.145 --> 13:33.413
I'm not used to having them.

13:33.446 --> 13:35.282
When I go somewhere,
everything else on my face

13:35.315 --> 13:36.283
just comes with me.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.218
Okay, well, go look for 'em.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.353
Your dad's in the garage.
I'll go get him to help.

13:40.387 --> 13:43.090
Okay, Kate, your last
meal before braces,

13:43.123 --> 13:44.457
just like you ordered.

13:44.491 --> 13:49.362
Popcorn, salt water taffy
and beef jerky.

13:49.396 --> 13:51.398
You know, those three things
are gonna meet in your stomach

13:51.431 --> 13:53.100
and they are
not gonna be friends.

13:53.133 --> 13:55.468
I don't even want braces.

13:55.502 --> 13:58.138
How about this:
just give me the money

13:58.171 --> 14:00.974
and I'll push my teeth together
with my fingers. Huh? See.

14:01.008 --> 14:04.344
Honey, I know it
stinks, all right?

14:04.377 --> 14:06.880
But if it helps,
it-it stinks for all of us.

14:06.914 --> 14:08.882
I mean, your dad
gave up his sports

14:08.916 --> 14:12.920
and I look like I'm trying
to murder 101 Dalmatians.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.924
Oh!

14:16.957 --> 14:18.959
I hope Andi doesn't find out
you bought the sports package

14:18.992 --> 14:20.360
on the Internet!

14:20.393 --> 14:22.362
It would help if
you didn't scream it

14:22.395 --> 14:24.097
at the top of your lungs.

14:24.131 --> 14:25.332
My bad!

14:25.365 --> 14:27.901
Oh, Crosby stole the puck.
Come on.

14:27.935 --> 14:28.969
Come on.
Go, go.

14:31.972 --> 14:33.440
Yeah!

14:33.473 --> 14:36.509
Hey! Look who's here.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.378
What's going on?

14:38.411 --> 14:40.213
Uh, okay,
it's not what you think.

14:40.247 --> 14:44.317
We were, um,
watching an adult movie.

14:44.351 --> 14:46.453
Really?
Mm.

14:46.486 --> 14:49.389
'Cause there was
a lot of high-fiving.

14:49.422 --> 14:52.525
It was very inspirational.

14:52.559 --> 14:55.996
Okay, look, I canceled all the
cable sports like I promised,

14:56.029 --> 14:58.331
but due to the miracle
of technology,

14:58.365 --> 15:00.467
I found all the games
on the Internet.

15:00.500 --> 15:01.935
For free?

15:01.969 --> 15:04.404
Free of you knowing about it.

15:04.437 --> 15:08.541
So you were just gonna hide the
expense in the Internet bill?

15:08.575 --> 15:09.542
Well...

15:09.576 --> 15:11.011
Whose idea was this?

15:11.044 --> 15:13.580
It was mine and I'm not sorry.

15:14.714 --> 15:15.682
You might be the wife,

15:15.715 --> 15:18.451
but I'm the hockey buddy;
I have a voice here.

15:18.485 --> 15:20.420
Really, Lowell?

15:20.453 --> 15:22.689
You really want to
go up against the wife?

15:22.722 --> 15:26.059
To be honest,
I'm losing steam.

15:27.194 --> 15:29.162
How was this even
supposed to work?

15:29.196 --> 15:30.563
I was ten feet away.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.199
Well, we had a plan.

15:32.232 --> 15:35.068
My dad was supposed
to be a lookout.

15:35.102 --> 15:38.138
Oh, yeah.
Your wife's coming.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.147
I can't believe you bought
the sports packages again.

15:47.180 --> 15:50.717
Okay, I admit, it looks
bad, but you know what?

15:50.750 --> 15:54.054
I won rock, paper, scissors
fair and square.

15:54.087 --> 15:56.990
Okay, that's school yard rules,
no backsies.

15:57.024 --> 15:59.326
That's your argument?

15:59.359 --> 16:01.328
Well, originally
it was Don's argument,

16:01.361 --> 16:03.196
which explains
why it isn't working.

16:03.230 --> 16:06.099
Actually, it's true.

16:06.133 --> 16:08.468
It is? I mean, it is.

16:08.501 --> 16:10.270
Look, I'll tell you what.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.605
I already gave up Josephine,
you have your sports back.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.107
Everything works out.

16:14.141 --> 16:16.043
Plus, four more punches
on my Jiffy Cuts card

16:16.076 --> 16:18.745
and I get a free beer koozie.

16:18.778 --> 16:22.749
Mm-hmm. So I do something
sneaky and you just give up?

16:24.051 --> 16:26.053
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

16:26.086 --> 16:28.388
The hairs on the back of
my neck are standing up.

16:28.421 --> 16:29.522
What's the catch?

16:29.556 --> 16:31.658
There's no catch.
I'm happy to do it.

16:31.691 --> 16:33.660
You know,
and years from now,

16:33.693 --> 16:35.495
when the kids are
accepting some award,

16:35.528 --> 16:37.430
they'll probably thank me
for being such a hero

16:37.464 --> 16:39.032
or, I don't know,
something like that.

16:39.066 --> 16:41.368
Wait, wait, wait,
what'd you say?

16:41.401 --> 16:43.736
I said I'm happy to do it.
No, after that. You said
you'd be the hero?

16:43.770 --> 16:45.438
Well, that goes
without saying.
Then why'd
you say it?

16:45.472 --> 16:47.407
Because I'd be the hero.
But I like being the hero.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.142
Well, you can't be the hero
if you don't make the sacrifice.

16:49.176 --> 16:50.009
Then I'm giving up my sports.

16:50.043 --> 16:51.244
Too late.
I already gave up my hair.

16:51.278 --> 16:53.780
Over my dead body. I'm giving up
my sports and that's final.

16:53.813 --> 16:57.484
Fine. I'll call Josephine
and make an appointment.

16:57.517 --> 16:58.685
You're damn right you will.

16:59.686 --> 17:02.021
Okay, it's settled.

17:06.393 --> 17:08.528
Oh, Andi!

17:10.097 --> 17:12.332
That was low.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.334
At least I didn't play
mind games with you.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.236
I had the decency
to straight-up lie.

17:16.269 --> 17:18.771
That's what a real hero does!

17:18.805 --> 17:21.374
Come on, Adam, it's my hair.

17:21.408 --> 17:22.809
My hair.

17:22.842 --> 17:26.346
Yesterday, at the park,
a skunk tried to hump my leg.

17:26.379 --> 17:29.249
Well, of course he did.
You're sexy.

17:29.282 --> 17:33.653
Oh, and at work, they made
a new name tag for me.

17:33.686 --> 17:36.123
It says Cruella de Burns.

17:36.156 --> 17:38.091
You have to go through
three departments

17:38.125 --> 17:38.925
to get a name tag.

17:38.958 --> 17:42.129
A vice president
had to sign off on it.

17:42.162 --> 17:43.796
All right, okay,
you know what?

17:43.830 --> 17:46.166
I'm gonna figure out a way
we can both get what we want.

17:46.199 --> 17:48.535
What are you gonna do?
I don't know, but I love you.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.270
I'm not gonna let
people make fun of you.

17:50.303 --> 17:51.404
Only I get to do that.

17:51.438 --> 17:53.273
That is my right
as your husband!

17:56.276 --> 17:58.678
That's right.

17:58.711 --> 18:00.280
That is good stuff.

18:05.352 --> 18:07.354
I just got us enough money
to pay for the braces,

18:07.387 --> 18:09.689
the glasses,
your hair, everything.

18:09.722 --> 18:13.193
Oh, my God, did you do
the escalator thing?

18:13.226 --> 18:16.763
No, no. I sold the motorcycle.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.898
What? It's not even finished.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.634
Well, Don and I stayed up
all night working on it.

18:21.668 --> 18:24.237
Check it out.

18:24.271 --> 18:26.673
Holy crap!

18:26.706 --> 18:28.675
You got this much
for that old bike?

18:28.708 --> 18:32.779
I may have told the guy it used
to belong to Steve McQueen.

18:34.347 --> 18:36.649
You are the
sweetest hero ever.

18:36.683 --> 18:39.486
Oh, I can't wait to call
Josephine and get my hair fixed.

18:39.519 --> 18:41.421
Oh, I'm gonna call
the cable company

18:41.454 --> 18:44.324
and get the fun machine
turned back on.
Yeah.

18:44.357 --> 18:47.694
Mom, look at my face.

18:47.727 --> 18:50.363
Oh, no, what happened?

18:50.397 --> 18:52.265
The school nurse says
I'm having an allergic reaction

18:52.299 --> 18:53.633
to the nickel in my braces.

18:53.666 --> 18:56.403
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

18:56.436 --> 18:58.905
At least you don't have
Mom's hair, huh

18:58.938 --> 19:00.807
And that's it for those.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.210
Honey, go upstairs
and wash your face.

19:03.243 --> 19:05.712
I'll be right up to put
some medicine on it.

19:05.745 --> 19:07.580
Okay, thanks.

19:07.614 --> 19:10.917
I guess this means I'm getting
the invisible ones.

19:12.985 --> 19:16.589
How much are
the plastic braces again?

19:16.623 --> 19:17.890
3,000 more.

19:17.924 --> 19:20.360
Oh, you got
to be kidding me.

19:25.932 --> 19:27.434
What was that?

19:27.467 --> 19:29.869
I think you just found
Teddy's glasses.

19:32.639 --> 19:35.642
Aah!

19:36.909 --> 19:39.746
Well, there goes
your sports.

19:39.779 --> 19:41.514
And your hair.

19:41.548 --> 19:45.518
But we still
got each other.

19:45.552 --> 19:47.554
BOTH:
Blah, blah, blah.

19:54.661 --> 19:56.929
This is nice.
Yeah, look at us, huh?

19:56.963 --> 19:59.266
Even on a budget,
we could still have fun.

19:59.299 --> 20:02.669
I got my hockey on the radio.
You're getting your hair fixed.

20:02.702 --> 20:05.272
I'm not sure you should be
doing it by candlelight,

20:05.305 --> 20:08.908
but  I'm half
schnockered, so whatevs.

20:08.941 --> 20:10.543
You got nothing
to worry about, babe.

20:10.577 --> 20:12.612
Just like painting a fence.

20:12.645 --> 20:15.282
(radio announcer
talking excitedly)

20:15.315 --> 20:17.950
Get it cleanly...
Crosby to the net! He scores!

20:17.984 --> 20:19.686
Woo-hoo!

20:19.719 --> 20:21.254
Oh...

20:21.288 --> 20:22.822
What happened?

20:22.855 --> 20:24.957
Uh, we just took the lead.

20:24.991 --> 20:26.959
To my hair, Adam.

20:26.993 --> 20:29.028
Uh, nothing.

20:29.061 --> 20:32.665
But, uh, what didn't happen
on this side

20:32.699 --> 20:36.836
needs to also not
happen on this side.
