NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system

00:03.453 --> 00:07.299
the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups,

00:07.357 --> 00:09.200
the police who
investigate crime

00:09.259 --> 00:12.069
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

00:12.128 --> 00:13.903
These are their stories.

00:15.365 --> 00:16.537
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

00:16.599 --> 00:18.340
(WOMAN EXCLAIMING)

00:18.401 --> 00:21.905
Hey, what's taking Mike?
His dessert's getting wasted.

00:21.971 --> 00:23.041
(LAUGHING) Maybe he fell in.

00:23.106 --> 00:24.244
(ALL LAUGHING)

00:24.307 --> 00:26.344
It looks delicious now.
Hey, easy.

00:26.409 --> 00:28.480
Hey! You said it
was getting wasted.

00:28.545 --> 00:30.149
He said it's Mike's.

00:30.213 --> 00:31.283
(sun FIRING)

00:31.348 --> 00:32.884
(WOMAN SCREAMING)

00:32.949 --> 00:34.087
Mike?

00:34.150 --> 00:35.424
(FIRING CONTINUES)

00:43.493 --> 00:44.597
Mike?

00:45.462 --> 00:46.600
Mike?

00:46.663 --> 00:50.270
MIKE: Andy, Paul,
I'm in here. I'm okay.

00:52.802 --> 00:54.839
The moron missed me.

00:54.904 --> 00:55.939
Let's get the hell out of here.

00:56.005 --> 00:57.643
Go. Go.

00:59.642 --> 01:02.555
OFFICER: Milton Garner,
37-year-old camera repairman.

01:02.612 --> 01:05.058
His wife's out front.
Poor woman's all shook up.

01:05.114 --> 01:08.653
Some lady saw him walking in
just as the shooting began.

01:09.119 --> 01:11.030
Excuse me.
Do you mind?

01:12.255 --> 01:14.292
This lock get busted
in the shooting?

01:14.357 --> 01:16.166
We broke it to get
at the second victim.

01:16.226 --> 01:19.207
Leon Mayer, 54,
he's a doctor from Seattle.

01:19.262 --> 01:20.536
Now he's at Hudson E.R.

01:20.597 --> 01:21.632
Good luck to him.

01:21.698 --> 01:24.474
He's unconscious.
He's got three slugs in him.

01:24.534 --> 01:26.741
And three holes in the door.

01:26.803 --> 01:30.012
That's impressive shooting. Was
anybody else in here with them?

01:30.073 --> 01:32.417
All right, these two guys,
they were at table 14,

01:32.475 --> 01:35.684
and they came running by with guns.
I figured them for cops.

01:35.745 --> 01:37.349
Their friend was
in the second stall.

01:37.414 --> 01:39.189
The one next to
the wounded guy.

01:39.249 --> 01:40.250
Looked pretty scared.

01:40.316 --> 01:41.317
Where'd they go?

01:41.384 --> 01:43.125
Oh, they went right
out the front.

01:43.186 --> 01:44.426
Where does that door lead?

01:44.487 --> 01:46.023
That's 47th Street.

01:46.089 --> 01:48.296
You got someone
canvassing out there?

01:49.025 --> 01:51.005
Okay, the shooter
probably went out there.

01:51.060 --> 01:53.506
Then, Mark here, says he saw
two guys run into the john,

01:53.563 --> 01:54.940
then three run out.

01:54.998 --> 01:56.568
They say anything?

01:56.633 --> 01:59.204
The third guy, the one that
they'd gotten out of the stall,

01:59.269 --> 02:01.180
I think he said that
the moron missed him.

02:01.237 --> 02:02.875
Okay, Mark, do me a favor,
you wait up front,

02:02.939 --> 02:04.111
then we're going to take
you down to the station,

02:04.174 --> 02:05.517
put you with a sketch
artist, all right?

02:05.575 --> 02:07.350
All right.

02:07.410 --> 02:08.787
Sounds to me like a hit.

02:08.845 --> 02:10.085
And a miss.

03:00.797 --> 03:02.242
This is a disaster.

03:02.298 --> 03:05.745
This party of three at table 14,
we're going to need a name.

03:05.802 --> 03:08.783
Party of six. Three couples.
There was no reservation.

03:08.838 --> 03:11.216
Really? The busboy said
you had a full house.

03:11.274 --> 03:12.912
We did.
But they insisted.

03:12.976 --> 03:14.421
Someone slipped you a $20?

03:14.477 --> 03:17.356
A $50. We've been
reviewed in the Times.

03:17.413 --> 03:19.120
Anybody come in after them?

03:19.182 --> 03:20.320
No.

03:20.383 --> 03:22.420
Did you see them talking
to any of the other patrons?

03:22.485 --> 03:24.226
Not that I noticed.

03:24.554 --> 03:25.658
Oh, uh...

03:25.722 --> 03:28.464
One of the ladies
gave me a card.

03:28.525 --> 03:30.368
She fancied herself
a wine expert.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.565
She ordered
the Cabaret Sauvignon.

03:33.229 --> 03:34.333
Can you imagine?

03:34.397 --> 03:35.432
How gauche.

03:36.165 --> 03:39.203
Gayle Landis, sales
representative, Wines Aplenty.

03:39.269 --> 03:41.647
She said she works
for them part-time.

03:41.704 --> 03:44.014
Wine in a bag.
Unbelievable.

03:44.941 --> 03:46.648
The guys seemed nice.

03:46.709 --> 03:49.383
Considering I think
they were ex-cons,

03:49.445 --> 03:50.947
which normally
doesn't bother me much.

03:51.014 --> 03:54.052
I mean, people make
mistakes, right?

03:54.350 --> 03:55.988
Right. Who were they?

03:56.386 --> 03:57.558
Jerks.

03:58.888 --> 04:00.231
Maybe I'm old-fashioned,

04:00.290 --> 04:03.203
but if you heard shooting,
would you ditch your date?

04:03.259 --> 04:05.865
He wouldn't.
Uh, these jerks have names?

04:06.496 --> 04:08.908
Andy, Paul and Mike.

04:09.632 --> 04:11.202
That's all I got.

04:11.267 --> 04:12.905
I never seen them
before last night,

04:12.969 --> 04:14.880
and I don't expect to
ever see them again.

04:14.938 --> 04:16.815
CURTIS: Which one was
in the restroom?

04:17.339 --> 04:18.648
Mike.

04:18.708 --> 04:20.016
What does Mike do?

04:20.076 --> 04:21.987
Professional stamp licker.
I don't know.

04:22.045 --> 04:24.616
He had his tongue in Jen's
ear most of the night.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.854
So how'd you hook up
with the Three Stooges?

04:26.916 --> 04:30.625
Jen. She said they were friends
of her husband, Kenny.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.598
Maybe we better talk to Kenny.

04:32.655 --> 04:33.827
He's easy to find.

04:33.890 --> 04:36.769
He's in Altona doing
three-to-six for armed robbery.

04:37.026 --> 04:38.232
JENNIFER: Gayle's wrong.

04:38.294 --> 04:41.571
You're cheating on your husband
with a guy somebody tried to kill.

04:41.631 --> 04:43.611
We understand how you'd
be scared to talk to us.

04:43.666 --> 04:45.111
I wasn't there.

04:45.168 --> 04:46.545
Why would Gayle lie?

04:46.603 --> 04:47.809
Out of habit.

04:47.870 --> 04:50.783
Did she happen to tell you
she was in Cats once?

04:50.840 --> 04:52.683
Maybe we should ask Kenny
what he thinks of his wife

04:52.742 --> 04:56.053
getting the wax sucked out of
her ear by his buddy Mike.

04:56.112 --> 05:00.060
Go ahead and ask him. He knows
it's just a bunch of lies.

05:00.116 --> 05:03.063
He doesn't know any Mike,
and I don't either.

05:05.021 --> 05:06.796
So, you want to
take a trip to Altona?

05:06.856 --> 05:08.893
And get lied to by a pro?

05:08.958 --> 05:10.995
If Kenny got wind
of Jenny and Mike,

05:11.060 --> 05:14.872
maybe he had one of his known
associates take care of things.

05:15.865 --> 05:18.641
(CRYING) Monday would have
been our fifth anniversary,

05:18.701 --> 05:21.409
but we couldn't get
a sitter for then,

05:23.006 --> 05:25.543
so we figured
we'd celebrate early.

05:27.110 --> 05:29.386
Why would anyone
want to hurt Milton?

05:29.445 --> 05:32.858
We think he was simply in the
wrong place at the wrong time.

05:33.249 --> 05:37.459
We were eating dinner in a nice
restaurant in a safe neighborhood.

05:37.520 --> 05:41.366
We're doing all we can. We're
very sorry for your loss.

05:44.961 --> 05:47.567
I have to pick up
our son at daycare.

05:51.334 --> 05:53.905
What's happening with the
other victim, Dr. Mayer?

05:53.970 --> 05:55.643
Still unconscious
and not getting better.

05:55.705 --> 05:57.013
His family been notified?

05:57.073 --> 05:58.313
His home number's unlisted,

05:58.374 --> 06:00.684
but we got his address
off his driver's license.

06:00.743 --> 06:03.189
Seattle PD's going to send a
car over to ring his doorbell.

06:03.246 --> 06:04.691
Didn't he have a credit card?

06:04.747 --> 06:07.227
Yeah. His billing address
is his work.

06:07.283 --> 06:09.923
I left a message on his
machine at his office.

06:09.986 --> 06:11.795
Maybe by Monday,
somebody will call us back.

06:11.854 --> 06:13.265
Where was he staying in town?

06:13.322 --> 06:16.997
He had a hotel key card, but the
hotel's name isn't on the card.

06:17.060 --> 06:20.098
Okay. Should I switch
to easy questions?

06:21.464 --> 06:23.375
Well, we know what caliber
he was shot with.

06:23.433 --> 06:26.209
Hospital pulled three
.38 slugs out of him.

06:26.569 --> 06:28.310
Kenneth Felker's sheet.

06:28.371 --> 06:31.215
The guy he pulled the stick-up
with, Michael Thompson.

06:31.274 --> 06:32.275
Mike.

06:32.342 --> 06:35.016
VAN BUREN: Felker's still in,
Thompson's already out?

06:35.078 --> 06:36.853
Oh, it pays to
rat out your friends.

06:36.913 --> 06:39.359
He rolled on Felker
and cut himself a deal.

06:39.415 --> 06:42.328
So, I guess Mike was in a hurry
to console Felker's wife.

06:42.385 --> 06:45.127
Get with his P.O.
for a current address.

06:46.089 --> 06:47.397
I don't know what
you're talking about.

06:47.457 --> 06:48.902
BRISCOE: Forget
about it, Mike.

06:48.958 --> 06:51.063
We passed your picture
around the restaurant.

06:51.127 --> 06:52.936
Four people made you.

06:58.468 --> 06:59.640
So why did you take off?

06:59.702 --> 07:02.273
What we hear, someone was
trying to whack you.

07:02.338 --> 07:05.148
I didn't want to get violated 'cause
I'm eating with the wrong people.

07:05.208 --> 07:08.018
You're going to get violated now
if you don't start talking.

07:08.077 --> 07:10.421
So, who was this
moron throwing shots?

07:11.481 --> 07:14.155
Willie. Willie Felker.
Kenny's brother.

07:14.217 --> 07:15.560
He found out about me and Jen.

07:15.618 --> 07:17.291
We had some words
a few days back.

07:17.353 --> 07:19.560
Those words include,
"I'm going to kill you"?

07:19.622 --> 07:20.657
Yeah.

07:20.723 --> 07:22.760
So what happened
at the restaurant?

07:24.293 --> 07:26.671
I'm sitting on the john,
minding my business.

07:26.729 --> 07:30.006
People come in, they go out.
Then I hear a gun cock.

07:30.066 --> 07:32.068
So, right away,
I pull my feet up.

07:32.135 --> 07:33.910
Then it's like
a shooting gallery.

07:33.970 --> 07:35.574
I heard the guy next
to me getting popped.

07:35.638 --> 07:38.278
How did you know it was Kenny's brother?
You saw him?

07:38.341 --> 07:39.877
Oh, yeah. I just stuck
my head right out

07:39.942 --> 07:41.387
and said
"Is that you, Willie?"

07:41.444 --> 07:43.685
How did this guy know you were
going to be at that restaurant?

07:43.746 --> 07:45.020
He didn't.
He followed me.

07:45.081 --> 07:46.958
You sure?
He had to.

07:47.617 --> 07:48.857
Unless the brother is Kreskin,

07:48.918 --> 07:50.363
he couldn't have
been waiting for them

07:50.419 --> 07:51.921
if they didn't know
where they were going.

07:51.988 --> 07:55.128
Could have waited outside till he
saw Mike head for the john. Curtis.

07:55.191 --> 07:56.898
They were stuffing
themselves for an hour.

07:56.959 --> 07:59.496
Somebody would've noticed him
hanging around.

07:59.562 --> 08:01.769
Yeah. Thanks.
It's Profaci.

08:01.831 --> 08:05.074
Hospital just called. Mayer
just took a turn for the worse.

08:05.134 --> 08:07.774
May be our last chance
to talk to him.

08:08.905 --> 08:10.282
He won't be able to
talk for a few days.

08:10.339 --> 08:13.047
We had to open him up again.
But he's stable for now.

08:13.109 --> 08:14.213
What happened?

08:14.277 --> 08:15.551
Pulmonary embolism.

08:15.611 --> 08:17.352
Once we got inside,
we figured out why.

08:17.413 --> 08:19.120
We missed a bullet
the first time around.

08:19.182 --> 08:20.286
You missed a bullet?

08:20.349 --> 08:22.226
What can I tell you. It
didn't show up in the x-rays.

08:22.285 --> 08:24.162
So that makes four bullets
you took out of him?

08:24.220 --> 08:26.359
That's right. I hope
we have them all now.

08:27.790 --> 08:30.066
There were only three holes
in the door of the stall.

08:30.126 --> 08:31.696
Yeah.
The door that was locked.

08:31.761 --> 08:33.104
So, Mayer must
have taken a bullet

08:33.162 --> 08:34.470
before he could get it closed.

08:34.530 --> 08:37.510
So, if the door was open
when the shooting started,

08:37.567 --> 08:39.477
the perp had to see
who he was shooting at.

08:39.534 --> 08:41.207
Mayer was the target, not Mike.

08:41.270 --> 08:42.613
Good news for Mike.

08:43.272 --> 08:45.252
CURTIS: We got Dr. Mayer's
personal effects here.

08:45.842 --> 08:49.051
BRISCOE: Breath spray. Breath mints.
Maybe he had a date.

08:49.111 --> 08:50.749
Here. Check his
wallet for rubbers.

08:50.813 --> 08:52.383
You think his date shot him?

08:52.448 --> 08:54.359
Or whoever he came
to town to see.

08:54.417 --> 08:56.363
Picture of his kids.
No wife.

08:56.419 --> 08:57.625
Probably divorced.

08:57.687 --> 09:00.827
Seattle PD said they didn't get an
answer when they rang his doorbell.

09:01.123 --> 09:04.468
Restaurant receipts.
Modo Mio in LA Monday night.

09:04.527 --> 09:07.701
Receipt for magazines.
O'Hare Airport Wednesday.

09:08.264 --> 09:10.710
Another restaurant
in Atlanta Thursday night.

09:10.766 --> 09:12.768
Must have had
a hell of a practice.

09:12.835 --> 09:17.215
Rent. Friday night. $75 ticket.
You think he went by himself?

09:17.273 --> 09:18.547
Well, he had dinner by himself.

09:18.608 --> 09:20.451
Maybe his date got a headache.

09:24.146 --> 09:26.456
(KEYBOARD CLACKING) WOMAN:
September 14th. Row what?

09:26.515 --> 09:28.324
Seat 14.

09:29.352 --> 09:32.060
Is this about somebody
scalping tickets?

09:32.588 --> 09:33.623
No.

09:33.789 --> 09:35.564
Come on. You gotta tell me.

09:36.192 --> 09:37.569
Homicide.

09:37.627 --> 09:39.163
Really?

09:39.228 --> 09:41.003
My friends are going to die.

09:41.464 --> 09:43.307
About the ticket.

09:43.366 --> 09:45.312
Sure.
(COMPUTER BEEPS)

09:45.368 --> 09:48.508
The ticket was bought as
a single by Leon Mayer.

09:49.572 --> 09:51.984
Is that the guy
who was homicided?

09:52.041 --> 09:54.988
BRISCOE: No. Did Mr. Mayer
call the order in?

09:55.811 --> 09:58.587
No. The concierge at
his hotel would have.

09:58.648 --> 10:01.993
The ticket's part of a block
we put aside for some hotels.

10:02.051 --> 10:04.725
They're mainly singles,
real tough to unload.

10:04.787 --> 10:06.232
Which hotel?

10:07.223 --> 10:09.533
(COMPUTER BEEPS) The Hampstead.

10:09.825 --> 10:10.963
He checked in Friday morning.

10:11.027 --> 10:13.234
Housekeeping doesn't think
the room's been slept in.

10:13.296 --> 10:15.503
You booked his theater ticket?
Yes.

10:15.564 --> 10:16.907
Did he say why he was in town?

10:16.966 --> 10:18.843
No. We just talked
about musicals.

10:18.901 --> 10:22.610
He said that he'd seen Yul Brynner
in The King and I in 1964.

10:22.672 --> 10:25.084
Well, it's just
clothing and toiletries.

10:25.141 --> 10:26.916
No address book.
No appointment book.

10:26.976 --> 10:28.717
Probably all on his hard drive.

10:28.778 --> 10:29.950
Probably?

10:30.012 --> 10:31.286
It's password protected.

10:32.582 --> 10:34.220
Is that his bill?

10:35.584 --> 10:36.995
No phone calls.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.794
Did he get any messages? No.

10:38.854 --> 10:40.356
What's this notation mean?

10:40.423 --> 10:43.029
The room's been prepaid
by Phillips and Schulman.

10:43.092 --> 10:45.732
It's a law firm. They
often put people up here.

10:45.795 --> 10:47.297
He's an expert witness,

10:47.363 --> 10:50.674
forensic psychologist.
One of the best in his field.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.371
He was due in court
after lunch today.

10:52.435 --> 10:53.778
Yeah? What case?

10:53.836 --> 10:55.042
People v. Worley.

10:55.738 --> 10:57.183
The guy who ran
over his girlfriend?

10:57.239 --> 10:58.775
Dr. Mayer was
going to testify

10:58.841 --> 11:02.152
my client isn't responsible for
murdering the girl he murdered.

11:02.478 --> 11:04.549
Oh, one of those
expert witnesses.

11:05.548 --> 11:07.858
And I thought Mayer
was being paranoid.

11:08.317 --> 11:09.421
What are you talking about?

11:09.485 --> 11:13.126
He was pissed we made the hotel
reservation under his real name.

11:13.189 --> 11:15.829
He always checks in
under a pseudonym.

11:15.891 --> 11:17.734
This is going to be a lawsuit.

11:18.060 --> 11:19.539
I know it.

11:22.264 --> 11:25.473
Worley. Didn't he crush his
girlfriend against a wall with a car?

11:25.534 --> 11:27.775
Yeah. A '54 Studebaker.

11:27.837 --> 11:31.080
Mayer was the hired gun to convince
a jury Worley's a mental defect.

11:31.140 --> 11:34.587
I'm convinced. Guy purposely
messed up a vintage automobile.

11:34.643 --> 11:37.749
So Mayer was shot by
an antique car collector?

11:37.813 --> 11:39.087
Or by the girl's brother.

11:39.148 --> 11:41.128
Lawyer said he attacked
Worley at his arraignment.

11:41.183 --> 11:44.630
Well, see where this hot-head
had dinner Friday night.

11:45.087 --> 11:47.567
LARRY: I begged Lisa
to get away from him.

11:47.623 --> 11:51.127
She finally told him to get
lost, the bastard killed her.

11:51.193 --> 11:53.400
So, what? You went to
court to kick his ass?

11:53.462 --> 11:56.466
Seeing his smug face, it seemed
like the right thing to do.

11:56.532 --> 11:58.205
CURTIS: Where were you
Friday night?

11:58.267 --> 12:01.248
At home with my wife,
my kids and my mother.

12:01.303 --> 12:03.510
She's staying with us
during the trial.

12:03.572 --> 12:07.418
Must be tough, thinking this guy
might get off on an insanity plea.

12:07.476 --> 12:10.514
Mayer made a career
out of this theory of his,

12:10.579 --> 12:12.684
dissociation disorder.

12:12.748 --> 12:16.025
He says Worley snapped
and went into a trance.

12:16.719 --> 12:17.754
It's a joke.

12:18.287 --> 12:20.631
Big break he won't be
able to testify, huh?

12:21.590 --> 12:23.866
It's funny how things
work out, huh?

12:23.926 --> 12:25.564
But I had nothing
to do with it.

12:26.095 --> 12:30.100
Try the families of the 200-plus
victims his clients have killed.

12:30.566 --> 12:32.910
MAITRE D': Sorry.
I've never seen him before.

12:32.968 --> 12:34.379
None of the busboys
or waiters...

12:34.437 --> 12:35.814
No. They don't
remember him, either.

12:35.871 --> 12:36.975
I wish I could help.

12:37.039 --> 12:38.109
That pretzel guy,

12:38.174 --> 12:39.551
is he a regular around here?

12:39.608 --> 12:41.246
Day and night.
I can't get rid of him.

12:41.310 --> 12:43.256
Sometimes we can smell
those disgusting things

12:43.312 --> 12:44.882
all the way in the restaurant.

12:44.947 --> 12:46.426
Well, thanks.

12:46.816 --> 12:50.525
So, the shooter comes out the side
door, maybe he ran by this guy.

12:50.586 --> 12:52.998
Yeah. So, what do you say
we have some lunch?

12:53.055 --> 12:55.296
CURTIS: Hey! How are you
doing? Police.

12:55.357 --> 12:58.361
I have a permit at home. The
boss won't sign for renewals.

12:58.427 --> 13:01.806
Relax. We're not the pretzel police.
Let me have an extra salty.

13:01.864 --> 13:02.865
Yes, sir.

13:02.932 --> 13:06.379
So, last Friday night, you
here for all the excitement?

13:06.435 --> 13:08.938
Excitement? BRISCOE: Yeah.
The shooting inside.

13:09.004 --> 13:10.347
Oh, yes. Yes.

13:10.406 --> 13:11.646
I don't know what
the guy's talking about.

13:11.707 --> 13:13.152
These are pretty good.
Thank you.

13:13.209 --> 13:15.883
So, did the police officers
take your statement?

13:15.945 --> 13:20.291
Oh, no. When cops are coming,
I'm going. Quickly.

13:20.349 --> 13:22.488
Did you see this guy
run out the side door?

13:22.551 --> 13:24.622
Nobody comes out
from that door.

13:24.687 --> 13:25.927
CURTIS: Nobody? You sure?

13:25.988 --> 13:28.525
Yes. If people
come out, I see them.

13:29.625 --> 13:32.902
So, nobody saw the shooter
leave through the dining room.

13:32.962 --> 13:35.238
He had to go out the side.

13:35.297 --> 13:37.470
Unless he ducked in here.

13:37.533 --> 13:38.705
Oh, sorry.

13:40.703 --> 13:42.842
There were interviews with two
women who were in the can

13:42.905 --> 13:45.613
at the time of the shooting. I
think they would've noticed.

13:45.674 --> 13:47.449
Not if he was a she.

13:48.944 --> 13:51.185
PRENTISS: The poor man
who was killed?

13:51.247 --> 13:53.591
He was right in front of me.

13:53.649 --> 13:57.222
Walked into the men's room
just as the shots were fired.

13:57.286 --> 13:59.129
BRISCOE: So, what did you do?

13:59.188 --> 14:02.192
Ran into the ladies' room
and stayed there.

14:02.258 --> 14:03.828
I was terrified.

14:03.893 --> 14:04.963
Anybody in there with you?

14:05.027 --> 14:06.062
One other woman.

14:06.395 --> 14:08.807
She came out of a stall
and asked what was going on.

14:08.864 --> 14:10.309
And then another woman ran in.

14:10.366 --> 14:12.175
How soon after you
did she come in?

14:12.234 --> 14:13.770
Right after the shooting.

14:13.836 --> 14:16.009
We heard a commotion
in the hallway,

14:16.071 --> 14:19.245
but we just stayed put until the
waiter said it was safe to come out.

14:19.308 --> 14:20.548
What happened to
the third woman?

14:20.609 --> 14:22.987
Don't know.
It was very confused.

14:23.045 --> 14:24.581
CURTIS: Can you describe her?

14:24.647 --> 14:25.751
Yes.

14:26.582 --> 14:30.826
Ann Taylor knock-off pantsuit,
wannabe Prada pumps

14:30.886 --> 14:34.424
and a leatherette copy of a
Coach portfolio bag in black.

14:34.490 --> 14:36.595
Very tacky.
What did she look like?

14:36.692 --> 14:42.506
Oh! She was about 5'7",
light brown hair, bangs.

14:43.265 --> 14:45.302
I noticed her earlier
eating alone.

14:45.367 --> 14:47.108
Why? Because of
the tacky outfit?

14:48.237 --> 14:51.741
I noticed the man in the Zegna
suit who tried to pick her up.

14:51.807 --> 14:55.619
He and another man were at the
table next to me and my husband.

14:55.678 --> 14:57.214
CURTIS: It wasn't hard,
Mr. Patterson.

14:57.279 --> 14:58.758
We traced your pal
from his credit card,

14:58.814 --> 15:00.589
and he gave us your name.

15:00.649 --> 15:01.719
I better be careful.

15:01.784 --> 15:03.957
Wouldn't want my fiancée
to get the wrong idea.

15:04.019 --> 15:05.692
What idea is she
supposed to get?

15:05.754 --> 15:07.358
(SIGHS) It was a gag.

15:07.423 --> 15:09.562
My buddy bet me I couldn't
have dessert with the lady.

15:09.625 --> 15:11.571
Did you get as far
as exchanging numbers?

15:11.627 --> 15:12.901
Not even a first name.

15:12.962 --> 15:14.737
Said she was busy and
pulled out some work.

15:14.797 --> 15:16.470
Really.
Didn't want to talk to me.

15:16.532 --> 15:18.102
What kind of work?

15:18.167 --> 15:22.115
Looked like party planning,
promotions, that kind of thing.

15:22.171 --> 15:24.481
Funmakers. That was
the name on the book.

15:24.540 --> 15:26.383
We're gonna need
your help with a sketch.

15:26.442 --> 15:27.750
I got to get back to work.

15:27.810 --> 15:29.517
We'd really appreciate it, Hal.

15:29.578 --> 15:31.524
And so would your fiancée.

15:32.314 --> 15:34.624
YELLIN: It looks like Lindsay Carson,
but it's not very flattering.

15:34.683 --> 15:35.753
What does she do here?

15:35.818 --> 15:38.025
She's a freelance coordinator,
handles corporate events.

15:38.087 --> 15:39.327
CURTIS: Do you know
where we can find her?

15:39.388 --> 15:41.629
Oh, let's see.

15:41.690 --> 15:44.864
She's in Chicago at a convention,
and she'll be back tomorrow.

15:44.927 --> 15:45.997
Is she in trouble?

15:46.061 --> 15:47.438
We just want to talk to her.

15:47.496 --> 15:49.669
Did she ever mention
if anybody in her family

15:49.732 --> 15:51.405
had been the victim
of a serious crime?

15:51.467 --> 15:52.639
No.

15:52.701 --> 15:53.941
I don't really
know her very well.

15:54.003 --> 15:55.607
She's only been working
for us a few months.

15:55.671 --> 15:56.979
She's not a talker.

15:57.039 --> 15:58.814
Do you know if she's
from around this area?

15:58.874 --> 16:00.217
I don't think so.

16:00.276 --> 16:01.812
Maurry hired her.
He read her resume,

16:01.877 --> 16:03.379
but he's in Pittsburgh
till Monday.

16:03.445 --> 16:04.822
Can we take a look
at that resume?

16:05.948 --> 16:08.588
(LAUGHS) You don't know
Maurry's filing system.

16:10.452 --> 16:12.329
BRISCOE: Mayer's office
faxed it over.

16:12.388 --> 16:15.665
It's a list of all the cases
the good doctor testified in,

16:15.724 --> 16:18.637
including the names of the victims.
None of them named Carson.

16:18.694 --> 16:20.799
That would be too easy.

16:20.863 --> 16:23.969
Dr. Mayer's been busy. There
must be over 100 cases here.

16:24.033 --> 16:25.569
BRISCOE: One hundred
and thirty-two.

16:25.634 --> 16:27.136
What's his batting average?

16:27.202 --> 16:30.706
Forty-three acquittals
by reason of mental defect.

16:30.773 --> 16:33.754
The doctor let these killers
walk into a padded cell.

16:33.809 --> 16:35.720
And then they walked home.

16:36.145 --> 16:38.250
Okay. According to the
state employment records,

16:38.314 --> 16:39.850
Lindsay Carson worked in Albany

16:39.915 --> 16:41.724
for six years
before moving here.

16:41.784 --> 16:45.596
Albany? Dr. Mayer worked
a case in Albany.

16:46.555 --> 16:49.365
People v. Rigg.
Double homicide.

16:49.425 --> 16:52.463
The victims were Robert Kort
and Kathy Morris.

16:57.199 --> 17:00.578
My back was to the door.
I don't remember after that.

17:01.003 --> 17:02.914
I never saw who it was.

17:03.472 --> 17:05.315
Do you get a lot of threats
in your line of work?

17:05.374 --> 17:07.319
I mean, setting killers free?

17:08.143 --> 17:10.749
Nobody goes free.
They get treatment.

17:11.512 --> 17:13.685
But anonymous calls
and letters.

17:13.749 --> 17:15.751
I've been doing this
over 20 years.

17:16.050 --> 17:18.190
The name Lindsay Carson
mean anything to you?

17:18.252 --> 17:19.925
Business or otherwise?

17:19.989 --> 17:21.297
No. Who is she?

17:21.357 --> 17:24.395
CURTIS: She's from Albany. You had a
case up there a couple of years ago.

17:24.460 --> 17:27.099
People v. Rigg.
Guy killed two people.

17:27.596 --> 17:29.837
Yes. His boss and
a co-worker.

17:30.566 --> 17:31.840
He'd been fired.

17:31.900 --> 17:35.177
Being a defense witness, you
must have been very popular.

17:35.237 --> 17:38.650
People get emotional.
That's why I'm careful,

17:39.475 --> 17:42.081
but there's no reason anybody
in Albany would hold a grudge.

17:42.144 --> 17:43.521
CURTIS: How's that?

17:43.946 --> 17:47.086
The jury found Rigg guilty.
Life without parole.

17:49.084 --> 17:50.324
BRISCOE: Thanks.

17:51.854 --> 17:54.994
Oh, Doctor, one more thing.
What's your fee?

17:56.091 --> 17:58.002
$00,000 to $60,000.

17:58.894 --> 18:01.534
If I was Rigg,
I'd ask for a refund.

18:02.331 --> 18:05.608
Rigg is in Attica. Guess
who was on his guest list?

18:08.103 --> 18:10.606
Lindsay Rigg Carson.
His daughter?

18:11.073 --> 18:12.984
We make her 10 feet
from the scene

18:13.042 --> 18:15.648
five seconds after
the shooting stops.

18:15.711 --> 18:18.555
That's 10 feet too far and five seconds
too late for an arrest warrant.

18:18.614 --> 18:20.389
Even if you talk
to Judge Siedenburg?

18:20.449 --> 18:22.725
He's in the hospital.
Gallstones.

18:23.185 --> 18:25.961
I could talk to Judge Flores.
Search warrant good enough?

18:29.758 --> 18:32.398
I need you to open the storage room
for this detective. All right?

18:32.461 --> 18:35.271
Rey! Get a look at this.
It was under the bed.

18:35.330 --> 18:38.504
Court TV, Mayer testifying
at her father's trial.

18:39.101 --> 18:42.082
Mayer testifying
in Florida, in LA.

18:42.137 --> 18:44.674
Without Reason
by Dr. Leon Mayer.

18:44.740 --> 18:46.310
Looks like she has
the complete works.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.855
Yeah. Plus a bunch of
newspaper clippings of Mayer.

18:48.911 --> 18:50.948
Only thing missing is the
doll with the pins in it.

18:51.013 --> 18:52.993
I'd rather have the gun.

18:53.916 --> 18:56.157
Take a look at this.
Must be Rigg.

18:56.218 --> 18:58.027
CARSON: What are you
doing to my home?

18:58.087 --> 18:59.862
You can't just come in
here like this.

18:59.922 --> 19:02.425
Ms. Carson, we have
a search warrant.

19:02.491 --> 19:05.199
I don't care.
That's my property.

19:05.260 --> 19:07.001
Yeah. Well, now
it's evidence.

19:07.062 --> 19:08.735
But if you want to make sure
we don't lose it,

19:08.797 --> 19:10.140
you're welcome to
come along with us.

19:10.199 --> 19:13.180
Once we're done, you can leave and
take this stuff back with you.

19:13.235 --> 19:15.078
I guess I don't have a choice.

19:15.137 --> 19:16.138
Then if you don't mind.

19:16.205 --> 19:17.275
We have to check and make sure

19:17.339 --> 19:18.511
you're not carrying
anything dangerous,

19:18.574 --> 19:21.214
like a hatpin. Officer, you
want to escort her, please.

19:21.276 --> 19:22.414
(SIGHS)

19:22.478 --> 19:23.582
Miss?

19:24.546 --> 19:26.492
I told you, I don't know
where I was on Friday night.

19:26.548 --> 19:27.891
I've been working very hard.

19:27.950 --> 19:30.988
So, you really don't remember
where you ate dinner?

19:31.053 --> 19:32.191
Why is that so important?

19:32.254 --> 19:34.063
People saw you at
the Trident Restaurant

19:34.123 --> 19:36.296
on 9th Avenue around midnight.

19:36.959 --> 19:39.132
It's a mistake.
I never eat that late.

19:39.194 --> 19:42.471
Funny thing is, that's the same
time two people got shot there.

19:42.531 --> 19:44.101
One of them was killed.

19:44.166 --> 19:47.113
And the other one seems
to be a hobby of yours.

19:47.169 --> 19:48.648
Dr. Mayer?

19:48.704 --> 19:50.706
What? You think
I shot him?

19:50.772 --> 19:52.979
It sure looks like
you got a problem with him.

19:53.041 --> 19:55.487
What, you blame him for
your father's conviction?

19:55.544 --> 19:59.424
Oh, I get it. My father got railroaded
for murder, now it's my turn.

20:00.115 --> 20:01.822
This girl's going
to be a lot of fun.

20:01.884 --> 20:03.022
She's been here almost an hour

20:03.085 --> 20:04.189
and she hasn't been Mirandized?

20:04.253 --> 20:05.960
We told her she can leave
whenever she wants.

20:06.021 --> 20:07.500
I'd like to keep her talking.

20:07.556 --> 20:09.763
I'd like to be sure whatever
she does say, we can use.

20:09.825 --> 20:11.202
Lieutenant.

20:18.634 --> 20:20.807
Ms. Carson,
I'm Lieutenant Van Buren.

20:20.969 --> 20:22.778
I'd like you to
clear up a few points.

20:22.838 --> 20:24.249
Do you own a gun?
No.

20:24.306 --> 20:25.614
Have you been in
possession of one?

20:25.674 --> 20:26.709
No, of course not.

20:26.775 --> 20:28.914
Have you fired one at
a shooting range recently?

20:28.977 --> 20:30.251
No.

20:30.312 --> 20:31.950
Then maybe you can
explain why our lab

20:32.014 --> 20:34.358
found traces of gunpowder
in your portfolio.

20:36.752 --> 20:38.060
(SIGHS)

20:38.120 --> 20:40.396
I've answered enough questions.
I'm leaving now.

20:40.455 --> 20:43.629
I want my portfolio back,
and I'm taking these with me.

20:43.692 --> 20:44.830
I'm afraid that's not possible.

20:44.893 --> 20:45.894
I'm not leaving without them.

20:45.961 --> 20:47.201
You're not leaving.

20:47.262 --> 20:49.105
Please, put those down.

20:49.164 --> 20:51.735
You're being arrested for
murder and attempted murder.

20:51.800 --> 20:54.246
What? You have the right
to remain silent.

20:54.303 --> 20:56.613
Anything you say can be
used in a court of law.

20:56.672 --> 20:59.278
You have the right to an attorney.
If you can't afford...

21:01.343 --> 21:04.017
VERDON: This material
serves only one purpose,

21:04.079 --> 21:07.424
to make my client look like
a blue ribbon lunatic.

21:07.482 --> 21:08.722
If the shoe fits.

21:08.784 --> 21:11.196
It's just research.
My father needed an expert.

21:11.253 --> 21:13.824
Ms. Powell, would you
instruct your client?

21:13.889 --> 21:15.197
Yes, Your Honor.

21:15.791 --> 21:18.362
Ms. Carson assembled
these clippings on the doctor

21:18.427 --> 21:21.169
when she was thinking of hiring
him in her father's defense.

21:21.230 --> 21:22.834
And her client went
right on clipping

21:22.898 --> 21:24.741
long after her
father's trial was over.

21:24.800 --> 21:26.006
What was she researching then?

21:26.068 --> 21:27.843
She had an interest
in Dr. Mayer.

21:28.003 --> 21:29.983
It doesn't mean she
wanted to kill him.

21:30.038 --> 21:32.917
It's for a jury to decide
what she wanted.

21:32.975 --> 21:35.285
I'm going to allow
this material, Ms. Powell.

21:35.344 --> 21:39.349
Now for the other part of your
motion about the gunpowder residue?

21:39.414 --> 21:42.395
They had a premises warrant
for the apartment.

21:42.451 --> 21:44.556
Ms. Carson was in
the building hallway

21:44.620 --> 21:45.928
when they searched
her portfolio.

21:45.988 --> 21:48.730
The defendant voluntarily
handed it to the officers.

21:48.790 --> 21:50.201
They took it from me.

21:52.027 --> 21:54.473
What did they tell you?
Their exact words?

21:54.863 --> 21:57.810
They told me because I was going
to ride with them to the station,

21:57.866 --> 22:00.073
they had to check my portfolio
for anything dangerous.

22:00.135 --> 22:03.548
VERDON: Assuming even a temporary
seizure was legitimate,

22:03.605 --> 22:06.882
People v. Clements allows only
an inventory of the contents,

22:06.942 --> 22:08.148
not a chemical analysis.

22:08.377 --> 22:10.823
The gunpowder residue
was apparent to the officers.

22:10.912 --> 22:13.051
How? Were these
canine officers?

22:13.415 --> 22:14.655
The police have
every right to...

22:14.716 --> 22:17.424
To check for weapons
for their own safety.

22:17.486 --> 22:20.160
They don't need
a microscope to do that.

22:20.222 --> 22:21.599
The gunpowder is out.

22:21.657 --> 22:23.967
Then, Your Honor, I move
to dismiss the charges.

22:24.026 --> 22:25.699
The People have
no direct evidence.

22:25.761 --> 22:28.537
We can still place her in the ladies'
room right after the shooting.

22:28.830 --> 22:31.640
Come back when you can place
her in the men's room.

22:31.700 --> 22:35.671
The motion is granted.
Charges are dismissed.

22:38.640 --> 22:41.678
Don't these cops know,
you got a premises warrant,

22:41.743 --> 22:45.122
you bring the suspect into the
premises you want to search her.

22:45.180 --> 22:47.592
And procedure tells them
to keep a suspect

22:47.649 --> 22:49.686
outside the premises
they're searching.

22:49.751 --> 22:51.253
This wasn't their fault.

22:51.320 --> 22:52.697
Of course not.

22:52.754 --> 22:55.325
I hope somebody's putting
this case back together.

22:55.390 --> 22:57.802
The police are pulling her
travel records, phone records,

22:57.859 --> 22:59.805
if she stalked Mayer,
she might've left tracks.

22:59.861 --> 23:01.465
What does the doctor say?

23:01.530 --> 23:03.510
He doesn't remember
Carson or the shooting.

23:03.565 --> 23:05.977
He'd just gotten out of the ICU
when the police talked to him.

23:06.034 --> 23:07.980
How's he feeling now?

23:09.705 --> 23:13.209
I told the police. I never
heard of Lindsay Carson.

23:13.675 --> 23:15.154
You say she kept a file on me?

23:15.444 --> 23:17.947
Apparently she blames you for
her father going to prison.

23:18.347 --> 23:19.485
She said he was railroaded.

23:19.548 --> 23:21.653
Look, I did everything
I could for Mr. Rigg.

23:21.717 --> 23:22.889
The jury was out for blood.

23:23.385 --> 23:26.662
I can understand their feelings.
He executed two people.

23:26.722 --> 23:29.828
He was dissociative. He had
no idea what he was doing.

23:29.891 --> 23:33.202
After he was fired, he had what I
describe as a psychic overload.

23:34.229 --> 23:35.469
If you say so.

23:37.265 --> 23:39.074
Have you even read the case?

23:41.436 --> 23:43.279
Arthur Rigg had
been an employee

23:43.338 --> 23:46.012
of Pine Mountain Fabricating
for 18 years.

23:46.675 --> 23:50.054
He was fired on a Friday after his shift.
He snapped.

23:50.645 --> 23:53.023
He took a .38 out
of his glove box,

23:53.081 --> 23:56.119
and he shot his boss and his
boss's secretary in a parking lot.

23:56.885 --> 23:59.695
He didn't remember anything
for the next two days.

23:59.755 --> 24:02.497
That's classic
dissociative behavior.

24:02.557 --> 24:04.332
Rigs used a .38?

24:05.394 --> 24:07.840
Lindsay Carson shot you
with the same caliber gun.

24:09.398 --> 24:12.038
Not surprising.
It's symbolic.

24:12.267 --> 24:16.147
Or just practical. Do you know
if the gun was ever recovered?

24:19.775 --> 24:21.982
Because Rigg still
has appeals pending,

24:22.044 --> 24:24.957
Albany police wouldn't release
the actual slugs Rigg used.

24:25.013 --> 24:26.253
They sent macro photos.

24:26.314 --> 24:28.817
Will they do? I can make a phone call.
They're fine.

24:28.884 --> 24:32.058
I checked them against your
slugs from Mayer and Garner.

24:32.120 --> 24:33.929
The good news is,

24:33.989 --> 24:36.367
same number of lands and
grooves, same pitch.

24:36.424 --> 24:37.869
They were fired
from the same gun.

24:37.926 --> 24:39.633
The bad news is,

24:39.694 --> 24:42.766
the slugs from the restaurant
have too many secondary marks.

24:42.831 --> 24:44.367
Three went through
a metal door.

24:44.432 --> 24:47.504
Two were dug out of the wall,
and the sixth struck bone.

24:47.569 --> 24:49.344
So, I put you on
the stand and...

24:49.404 --> 24:51.907
I'd have to say
the match was 60%.

24:51.973 --> 24:53.680
You get me the gun,
we're in business.

24:53.742 --> 24:55.244
That's not likely.

24:55.877 --> 24:58.357
She shot Mayer
with her father's gun?

24:58.413 --> 25:00.393
Freud must be
having a good laugh.

25:00.448 --> 25:02.951
Unless we prove it,
so will Lindsay Carson.

25:03.785 --> 25:07.062
Her father must know where that
gun ended up two years ago.

25:07.122 --> 25:08.931
According to Mayer,
Rigg went blank

25:08.990 --> 25:11.266
for two days
after the shooting.

25:11.326 --> 25:14.466
Well, maybe we can
jog his memory.

25:14.529 --> 25:17.032
Who was the riding
A.D.A. in Albany?

25:18.366 --> 25:20.175
A deal for Arthur Rigg?

25:20.235 --> 25:22.010
JACK: What I'm asking
isn't unreasonable.

25:22.070 --> 25:24.676
If he cooperates with us,
you give him a shot at parole

25:24.740 --> 25:26.344
after 25 years.

25:26.408 --> 25:27.614
If he lives that long.

25:27.676 --> 25:29.019
SOLVAN: He's lucky
he lived this long.

25:29.077 --> 25:31.079
I asked for the death penalty.

25:31.146 --> 25:34.889
Robert Kort had four kids. Kathy
Morris was seven weeks pregnant.

25:34.950 --> 25:37.556
Rigg has a history of
drinking and brawling.

25:37.619 --> 25:41.032
As far as my constituents are
concerned, I lost that case.

25:41.089 --> 25:42.534
What will your
constituents think

25:42.591 --> 25:44.264
if you let another
killer walk free?

25:44.759 --> 25:46.761
That case is your problem.

25:47.496 --> 25:48.941
It wouldn't be
anybody's problem

25:48.997 --> 25:51.102
if your cops had
found Rigg's gun.

25:51.166 --> 25:53.168
That's hardly
a fair assessment.

25:53.235 --> 25:56.273
Lindsay Carson would've found
another gun to do the job.

25:56.338 --> 25:59.808
By the time we're through, the
media won't care about fairness.

25:59.875 --> 26:01.946
Especially if Rigg gets
anywhere with his appeals.

26:02.410 --> 26:04.447
He already lost
his direct appeal.

26:04.512 --> 26:06.492
And now he's writing
his own briefs.

26:06.548 --> 26:08.926
Have you seen
Acevedo v. US?

26:08.984 --> 26:11.157
For a jailhouse lawyer,
Rigg isn't bad.

26:11.219 --> 26:14.325
If a judge ever gets around to reading
his brief, he might just prevail.

26:14.389 --> 26:16.096
JACK: Ms. Solvan.

26:16.157 --> 26:18.330
If we convict Lindsay Carson,

26:18.393 --> 26:21.067
there's nothing I'd like more
than to give the credit

26:21.129 --> 26:23.439
to the Albany County
District Attorney's office.

26:25.767 --> 26:27.075
(EXHALES)

26:32.641 --> 26:34.814
I was finished with
this case a year ago.

26:34.876 --> 26:36.822
When I ran out of money.

26:36.878 --> 26:39.188
I did the trial.
I did the direct appeal.

26:39.247 --> 26:41.284
That's all I was
required to do.

26:41.349 --> 26:43.625
Now I drive all the way from
Albany to listen to this?

26:43.685 --> 26:45.323
We're prepared
to drop murder one

26:45.387 --> 26:47.367
down to murder two
against his daughter,

26:47.422 --> 26:50.460
and we're giving your client an opportunity
you haven't been able to offer.

26:50.525 --> 26:52.368
An opportunity to
sell out his daughter

26:52.427 --> 26:55.067
for a chance at
parole in 23 years?

26:55.764 --> 26:58.176
He's got a better shot
claiming I screwed up.

26:58.233 --> 26:59.576
ROSS: I read your brief.

26:59.634 --> 27:01.636
I wouldn't pack
your suitcase just yet.

27:01.703 --> 27:05.412
Maybe you haven't read Acevedo v.
US down in New York.

27:05.473 --> 27:07.817
You should give
the dissent a closer read.

27:07.876 --> 27:09.412
You're here to
stay, Mr. Rigg.

27:09.477 --> 27:11.582
You tell us how your daughter
ended up with your gun,

27:11.646 --> 27:12.886
you get a chance at parole.

27:12.948 --> 27:14.757
Parole after 15 years?

27:14.816 --> 27:16.818
You're lucky to
get any offer at all.

27:17.252 --> 27:19.858
I wouldn't wish
this life on anybody.

27:19.921 --> 27:21.594
Especially my own kid.

27:22.223 --> 27:24.669
Even if I could answer your
questions, I wouldn't.

27:26.027 --> 27:28.303
You can all go to hell.

27:28.363 --> 27:29.569
Guard!

27:36.037 --> 27:37.846
Well, it was worth a shot.

27:38.406 --> 27:40.716
Niagara Falls is 45 minutes away.
You ever been?

27:40.775 --> 27:43.881
When I was nine, my brothers
tried to push me in.

27:43.945 --> 27:46.289
Maybe we don't need Rigg
to connect her to the gun.

27:46.348 --> 27:48.385
If Albany Homicide
couldn't find the gun...

27:48.450 --> 27:51.397
They don't know what we know. They
tracked Rigg, not his daughter.

27:54.522 --> 27:55.694
ROSS: Monday, May 7.

27:55.757 --> 27:57.828
County jail records have
Lindsay visiting her father

27:57.892 --> 27:59.667
six hours after he surrendered.

27:59.728 --> 28:01.139
What time Monday?

28:01.196 --> 28:03.107
3:30 in the afternoon.

28:03.164 --> 28:05.110
Well, her work has
her checking out

28:05.166 --> 28:06.804
Monday at 1:00
in the afternoon,

28:06.868 --> 28:09.371
and she didn't come back in
until Tuesday afternoon.

28:09.437 --> 28:11.474
Monday, May 7?

28:11.540 --> 28:13.952
Wherever she went,
she had a full tank of gas.

28:14.008 --> 28:16.386
$18 worth, Monday, in Albany.

28:16.444 --> 28:18.788
I wonder what else she charged?

28:22.650 --> 28:27.690
Tuesday, Yellow Shutters Motel.
Binghamton, New York. $2.50.

28:27.756 --> 28:30.669
Must be an incidental charge.
Phone call maybe.

28:30.725 --> 28:33.001
She probably paid
for the room in cash.

28:33.061 --> 28:35.837
So, after she talked to her
father in the lock-up in Albany,

28:35.897 --> 28:37.376
right away she jumps in her car

28:37.432 --> 28:39.878
and drives two hours
to Binghamton.

28:39.935 --> 28:41.437
You guys want to check out
the accommodations

28:41.503 --> 28:43.005
at the Yellow Shutters Motel?

28:43.071 --> 28:45.347
We'll break out our thermals.

28:47.409 --> 28:48.444
(MAN CHATTERING ON TV)

28:48.510 --> 28:51.548
Here it is. May 7.

28:51.613 --> 28:57.120
Lindsay Carson.
Room 103. New York tags.

28:58.186 --> 29:02.066
Charge was for a phone call. Must've
been posted after she checked out.

29:02.123 --> 29:03.727
You have those phone records?

29:03.792 --> 29:08.172
From two years ago? We get rid
of that stuff after a year.

29:08.229 --> 29:12.200
Weird though. We were
pretty empty that night.

29:12.267 --> 29:14.679
I don't know why
they stuck her in 103.

29:14.736 --> 29:16.579
It's right beside the kitchen.

29:16.638 --> 29:17.639
Maybe she asked for it?

29:19.107 --> 29:21.747
Who used the room
the night before?

29:24.079 --> 29:27.151
Oh, here we go.
Gerald Foster.

29:28.316 --> 29:31.661
Him I remember.
Almost had to call the cops.

29:33.021 --> 29:35.501
Borrowed a screwdriver from me.

29:35.557 --> 29:37.969
Then he nearly took
my eye out with it.

29:38.026 --> 29:39.096
How come?

29:39.160 --> 29:43.734
I wanted a deposit on the
screwdriver, in case he lost it.

29:44.699 --> 29:47.270
The guy just went off on me.

29:47.335 --> 29:48.575
You get his license tags?

29:54.476 --> 29:59.323
Foster said he needed the
screwdriver to fix his car.

29:59.414 --> 30:03.920
After the Carson lady checked
out, I come to find out, uh,

30:04.986 --> 30:07.762
the space heater in
the room got broken.

30:07.822 --> 30:10.701
I think Foster tried
to take it apart.

30:10.892 --> 30:14.101
Lennie, it was Rigg's car.

30:16.364 --> 30:17.570
VERDON: You going to
keep arresting her

30:17.632 --> 30:20.636
until you find a judge stupid
enough to let you get away with it?

30:20.702 --> 30:21.908
JACK: We've got her
at the scene.

30:21.970 --> 30:23.415
We've got a decent
ballistics match.

30:23.471 --> 30:24.506
To what?

30:24.572 --> 30:26.518
To a gun she didn't
have access to?

30:26.574 --> 30:29.020
You mean the gun she removed
from the space heater

30:29.077 --> 30:32.718
of room 103 at the Yellow
Shutters Motel two years ago?

30:37.285 --> 30:38.389
What's your evidence?

30:38.453 --> 30:40.228
ROSS: A registration book
which shows your client

30:40.288 --> 30:42.825
and her father stayed in the
same room on consecutive nights.

30:44.159 --> 30:45.661
Another coincidence?

30:45.727 --> 30:48.264
The way they keep piling up,
it's enough to bury her.

30:48.329 --> 30:50.832
Not if you expect a jury to
vote on a capital charge.

30:50.899 --> 30:53.743
We'll argue inevitable discovery,
and get the gunpowder back in.

30:58.506 --> 30:59.610
(INAUDIBLE)

31:03.545 --> 31:05.252
You have an offer?

31:05.313 --> 31:07.725
Murder two.
Assault one. 25-to-life.

31:12.020 --> 31:13.522
Give us a day?

31:15.890 --> 31:18.734
JACK: It's still a mystery why she
chose to wreak her vengeance on Mayer.

31:18.793 --> 31:22.104
In my book, her father's
lawyer is a better candidate.

31:22.163 --> 31:24.074
Better a doctor
than a fellow attorney.

31:24.732 --> 31:28.475
We got Carson's answer.
She wants to change her plea.

31:31.973 --> 31:34.647
Not guilty by reason of
mental disease or defect.

31:34.876 --> 31:37.755
She's claiming she was
dissociative when she shot Mayer.

31:37.812 --> 31:38.916
Her father's defense.

31:40.048 --> 31:41.356
Maybe it's genetic.

31:42.016 --> 31:43.324
(CHUCKLES)

31:48.323 --> 31:50.064
I don't remember anything.

31:50.725 --> 31:51.760
DR. SKODA: Nothing?

31:51.826 --> 31:52.998
Mmm-mmm.

31:54.028 --> 31:58.443
Ms. Carson, the court ordered you to
answer all my questions honestly.

31:59.667 --> 32:01.977
I don't remember where I went,

32:02.036 --> 32:04.141
how I got there or what I did.

32:04.205 --> 32:06.776
I don't remember anything till
I woke up the next morning.

32:06.841 --> 32:09.287
What's the last thing
you do remember?

32:09.344 --> 32:12.689
I found out where Mayer was
staying, and I went to talk to him.

32:14.182 --> 32:15.183
With a gun?

32:15.250 --> 32:16.285
Mmm.

32:16.351 --> 32:18.228
The city's dangerous.

32:20.522 --> 32:22.729
I saw him outside his hotel.

32:24.959 --> 32:27.496
And I don't remember
anything after that.

32:27.962 --> 32:30.272
You were very interested
in Dr. Mayer.

32:30.331 --> 32:31.469
(SCOFFS)

32:32.967 --> 32:35.607
Because of him, my father will be
in prison the rest of his life.

32:36.404 --> 32:37.815
What did Dr. Mayer do?

32:38.773 --> 32:40.810
He screwed up.

32:40.875 --> 32:45.153
He got to Albany three hours
before he was supposed to testify.

32:45.213 --> 32:48.092
He only spent half an hour
examining my father,

32:49.450 --> 32:51.088
and on the stand
he confused him

32:51.152 --> 32:53.723
with another one
of his patients,

32:53.788 --> 32:56.166
and we mortgaged
the house to pay him.

32:56.457 --> 32:58.630
He was supposed
to save my father.

32:59.193 --> 33:00.604
HOW?

33:02.430 --> 33:05.934
(CRYING) By convincing the jury that
he didn't know what he was doing.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.707
It wasn't his fault.

33:07.769 --> 33:09.646
Just like this
wasn't your fault?

33:12.373 --> 33:14.410
My father is
a very good person.

33:15.243 --> 33:17.484
He is. He just snapped.

33:21.316 --> 33:25.560
He had worked so hard for those
people, and they just threw him away.

33:27.755 --> 33:30.258
If only the jury knew what
my father was really like.

33:30.325 --> 33:33.306
And it was Dr. Mayer's
job to tell them.

33:33.361 --> 33:35.534
What did you feel when you
knew he was coming to town?

33:36.097 --> 33:38.600
I don't know.
I just went numb.

33:39.767 --> 33:41.974
Mr. Rigg retained me
two days before the trial.

33:42.036 --> 33:43.572
They expected miracles.

33:43.638 --> 33:46.983
She's absolutely convinced
her father's not responsible.

33:47.041 --> 33:49.146
I don't care what her beef is.

33:49.744 --> 33:50.916
Do you buy this as a defense?

33:51.746 --> 33:53.589
Dissociation disorder?

33:53.948 --> 33:56.588
Even if I accepted
it as a legal defense,

33:56.651 --> 33:58.653
the symptoms are
too easy to mimic.

33:58.720 --> 34:00.358
How do you prove or
disprove memory loss?

34:00.421 --> 34:04.198
No offense, Dr. Skoda, but this
isn't your area of expertise.

34:04.258 --> 34:06.033
I mean, as much as
I wish it weren't so,

34:06.094 --> 34:08.973
Ms. Carson meets all the
criteria for dissociation.

34:09.030 --> 34:11.442
Those criteria are
completely subjective,

34:11.498 --> 34:13.409
and you gotta believe whatever
the defendant tells you.

34:13.467 --> 34:15.208
MAYER: Well, my studies
show otherwise.

34:15.268 --> 34:18.545
The disorder manifests itself
very specifically

34:18.606 --> 34:23.077
through irrational violence
brought on by emotional catalyst,

34:23.143 --> 34:26.250
accompanied by memory loss,
lack of affect and remorse.

34:26.313 --> 34:30.228
If that's all it takes to duck a murder
charge, we're all out of business.

34:30.284 --> 34:31.524
JACK: Doctors.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.958
The question is very simple.

34:34.322 --> 34:35.926
At the time she fired the gun,

34:35.989 --> 34:38.869
did Lindsay Carson appreciate
the consequences of her action,

34:38.926 --> 34:40.462
and did she know it was wrong?

34:40.928 --> 34:42.202
Yes.
No.

34:42.496 --> 34:43.771
Terrific.

34:48.503 --> 34:52.507
PRENTISS: She ran into the restroom just
moments after the shooting stopped.

34:52.572 --> 34:55.577
She was perspiring
and breathing heavily.

34:56.444 --> 34:58.424
JACK: What happened next?

34:58.479 --> 35:01.790
We stood away from the door,
the three of us, and waited.

35:01.849 --> 35:05.160
The other woman kept saying
"Oh, my God," over and over.

35:05.219 --> 35:06.254
I told her to be quiet

35:06.321 --> 35:08.562
so whoever did the shooting
wouldn't know we were in there.

35:09.023 --> 35:12.527
While you were waiting, did the defendant
do anything out of the ordinary?

35:13.561 --> 35:14.801
No.

35:15.129 --> 35:16.699
Thank you.

35:17.999 --> 35:21.037
Ms. Carson never said a word,
isn't that right?

35:21.102 --> 35:22.172
Yes. I think so.

35:22.236 --> 35:24.409
She wasn't screaming
hysterically, was she?

35:24.472 --> 35:27.817
No. She just stood there
quietly the whole time?

35:28.042 --> 35:29.112
Yes.

35:29.177 --> 35:31.680
Without displaying any
emotion, isn't that right?

35:31.746 --> 35:32.816
Yes.

35:34.348 --> 35:37.989
Didn't you think that was
strange, given the circumstance?

35:39.854 --> 35:40.924
Yes.

35:43.191 --> 35:44.329
Thank you.

35:46.527 --> 35:49.007
Since she wasn't seen leaving
through the side door

35:49.063 --> 35:50.508
or through the dining room,

35:50.565 --> 35:53.409
we concluded that she ran
into the ladies' room.

35:53.468 --> 35:56.074
That was later confirmed
by two witnesses.

35:56.738 --> 35:58.240
In your opinion,
would she have been seen

35:58.306 --> 36:01.185
if she'd left through the side
door or through the dining room?

36:01.242 --> 36:03.222
Yes, most likely.

36:03.277 --> 36:04.915
What if any conclusion

36:04.979 --> 36:06.686
did you draw from her running
into the ladies' room?

36:07.682 --> 36:09.525
That it was
pretty quick thinking.

36:10.385 --> 36:11.728
Thank you.

36:14.455 --> 36:17.368
My client has been charged
with shooting her victims

36:17.425 --> 36:20.531
in the busy men's room
of a crowded restaurant.

36:20.595 --> 36:22.871
Is that also evidence
of her quick thinking?

36:23.097 --> 36:24.132
I don't know.

36:24.198 --> 36:26.804
It was better than shooting
them in the dining room.

36:26.868 --> 36:28.279
(SIGHS) Move to strike,
Your Honor.

36:28.336 --> 36:32.182
The jury will disregard
the witness's last statement.

36:32.807 --> 36:36.050
During questioning,
Ms. Carson told you that

36:36.110 --> 36:38.488
she didn't remember
where she was

36:38.546 --> 36:40.287
on Friday night,
isn't that right?

36:41.683 --> 36:42.787
Yes.

36:42.850 --> 36:45.660
Did she say anything to you
to contradict that statement?

36:47.321 --> 36:48.356
No.

36:48.423 --> 36:52.496
And you were with her
prior to and after her arrest

36:52.560 --> 36:55.166
for nearly five hours,
isn't that right?

36:56.798 --> 36:57.970
Yes.

36:58.032 --> 36:59.136
Thank you.

37:01.502 --> 37:03.539
That was Briscoe on the phone.

37:03.604 --> 37:05.675
Feels bad about the way
his testimony went.

37:06.674 --> 37:09.245
We say she's cold blooded,
they say she was in a trance.

37:09.310 --> 37:10.550
Tomato, tomato.

37:10.611 --> 37:12.716
There's nothing
Briscoe could've done.

37:12.780 --> 37:14.453
It's Friday, Jamie.
Go home.

37:15.083 --> 37:16.494
I got the pleadings
from Rigg's trial,

37:16.551 --> 37:19.862
to see if his daughter's beef with
Mayer had any rational basis.

37:19.921 --> 37:20.956
And?

37:21.322 --> 37:23.563
It seems she had a better
case against the judge.

37:23.624 --> 37:25.069
The defense asked
for a continuance

37:25.126 --> 37:26.537
so Mayer could prepare
his testimony.

37:26.594 --> 37:27.629
The judge denied it.

37:27.695 --> 37:31.142
Fourth amendment due process violation.
Tailor-made for an appeal.

37:31.199 --> 37:33.372
That's just it.
I looked at Rigg's appeals.

37:33.434 --> 37:35.414
They never argued due process.

37:35.470 --> 37:38.417
Rigg is pretty sharp. He
wouldn't have overlooked it.

37:39.941 --> 37:41.477
Track down his lawyer.

37:41.542 --> 37:42.748
(SIGHS)

37:45.546 --> 37:48.083
You think I'm an idiot? Of course
it's grounds for an appeal.

37:48.349 --> 37:50.386
Funny it didn't find
its way into a brief.

37:51.452 --> 37:52.897
What're you accusing me of?

37:52.954 --> 37:56.663
You gave a less-than-zealous
representation of an unpopular defendant.

37:56.724 --> 37:58.567
Maybe the ethics committee
should look into this.

37:58.626 --> 38:01.505
He got a better defense
than he deserved.

38:01.562 --> 38:03.132
Look, I told Rigg
and his daughter

38:03.197 --> 38:05.040
we had a good
due process claim,

38:05.099 --> 38:06.772
but we needed
Mayer to back it up.

38:06.834 --> 38:07.904
What was the problem?

38:08.069 --> 38:09.241
Mayer refused to help.

38:09.303 --> 38:11.249
Did he say why?
No explanation.

38:11.305 --> 38:12.340
When was this?

38:12.406 --> 38:14.079
A year ago. Then Rigg
told me to drop it.

38:14.142 --> 38:16.019
And that was the end
of my involvement.

38:16.477 --> 38:18.582
You have the transcripts
of Rigg's trial?

38:18.746 --> 38:20.316
If Mayer wouldn't
help with the appeal,

38:20.381 --> 38:23.089
it gives Carson a whole
other motive to shoot him.

38:23.150 --> 38:25.824
If this woman had
been in touch with him,

38:25.887 --> 38:27.764
why did Mayer say he
never heard of her?

38:28.456 --> 38:31.926
Maybe for the same reason he didn't
want anything to do with Rigg's appeal.

38:32.059 --> 38:33.902
He's hiding something?

38:33.961 --> 38:36.237
The psychology profession.

38:37.298 --> 38:38.606
Good night.

38:39.200 --> 38:42.272
Jack. Mayer's testimony.

38:47.909 --> 38:49.217
This was no mistake.

38:49.277 --> 38:51.587
There's only one way
he could've known.

38:51.646 --> 38:53.648
Find out where
Mayer is, fly him in.

38:53.714 --> 38:56.285
I don't see him volunteering
to take the stand.

38:56.350 --> 38:58.728
Tell him we need to
put a face on the crime.

38:58.786 --> 39:02.324
Tell him we'll subpoena him.
Just get him into court.

39:04.158 --> 39:05.728
MAYER: I spent two months
in the hospital.

39:05.793 --> 39:08.637
I have an hour of
physical therapy every day.

39:10.097 --> 39:11.337
I suppose, though, I was lucky.

39:11.399 --> 39:13.572
Luckier, certainly,
than Mr. Garner.

39:14.502 --> 39:17.847
JACK: Were you aware that the
defendant holds you responsible

39:17.905 --> 39:19.782
for her father's conviction?

39:19.841 --> 39:21.343
No, not until recently.

39:22.209 --> 39:25.713
In Dr. Skoda's
videotaped interview,

39:25.780 --> 39:27.817
she claims that
you were unprepared,

39:28.583 --> 39:31.291
that you made factual errors
during the testimony,

39:31.352 --> 39:34.697
that you confused her father's
case with another. Is that true?

39:34.755 --> 39:36.325
I was prepared.

39:36.390 --> 39:38.961
I made one misstatement, which
I corrected immediately.

39:39.660 --> 39:42.038
What was the gist of your
testimony at that trial?

39:42.096 --> 39:43.769
That Arthur Rigg
committed his crimes

39:43.831 --> 39:45.970
while suffering from
dissociative disorder.

39:46.033 --> 39:48.138
What symptoms did he exhibit?

39:48.202 --> 39:51.274
Sudden and irrational
violence, memory loss.

39:51.339 --> 39:53.216
How serious was
his memory loss?

39:53.307 --> 39:54.581
Well, he couldn't
remember the shooting

39:54.642 --> 39:56.383
or anything that happened
in the next two days.

39:56.444 --> 39:58.253
And you believed him?
Oh, yes.

39:58.713 --> 40:02.251
So, he would have
no memory of his stay

40:02.316 --> 40:04.853
at the Yellow Shutters Motel
in Binghamton,

40:04.919 --> 40:06.660
the two nights
after the shooting?

40:09.056 --> 40:10.091
That's right.

40:13.427 --> 40:15.373
I refer to People's 16.

40:16.864 --> 40:21.540
The grand jury testimony of the
manager of the Yellow Shutters Motel.

40:22.870 --> 40:25.316
I'd like you to read
the highlighted portion.

40:29.477 --> 40:30.785
(CLEARS THROAT)

40:33.614 --> 40:35.992
"I remember him clearly because
the day after he checked in"

40:36.050 --> 40:37.620
"he threatened me
with a screwdriver."

40:41.322 --> 40:42.767
People's 43.

40:43.758 --> 40:47.934
This is a transcript of your testimony
at the trial of Arthur Rigg.

40:49.730 --> 40:52.870
Again, read the
highlighted portion.

41:02.610 --> 41:04.556
Dr. Mayer,
please read the passage.

41:08.749 --> 41:12.060
"Mr. Rigg exhibited classic
dissociative reactions."

41:12.119 --> 41:14.622
"Trance-like behavior
over a period of two days,"

41:14.689 --> 41:18.159
"instances of irrational violence,
including the shooting..."

41:20.327 --> 41:21.362
Please finish, Doctor.

41:23.331 --> 41:26.369
"...and the attack
with the screwdriver."

41:28.636 --> 41:31.048
This is the misstatement
that you referred to earlier?

41:31.105 --> 41:32.140
Yes.

41:40.181 --> 41:41.626
How did you know
about the attack?

41:45.953 --> 41:48.092
Answer the question, Doctor.

41:49.990 --> 41:51.492
Mr. Rigg told me.

41:51.892 --> 41:54.031
JACK: Even though
he'd lost his memory?

42:01.602 --> 42:03.047
(SIGHS)

42:03.204 --> 42:04.945
Permission to treat as hostile.

42:06.374 --> 42:07.785
Go ahead.

42:08.943 --> 42:11.150
Isn't it true that Mr. Rigg
had no memory loss?

42:11.645 --> 42:13.454
He had some loss of memory.

42:13.514 --> 42:14.720
He wasn't dissociative, was he?

42:14.782 --> 42:15.920
I stand by my diagnosis.

42:15.983 --> 42:17.155
You perjured yourself, Doctor.

42:17.218 --> 42:19.721
You sold your professional
integrity for $40,000.

42:19.787 --> 42:20.822
Isn't that true?
No!

42:20.888 --> 42:23.027
That's why you refused to
testify at Mr. Rigg's appeal.

42:23.090 --> 42:24.467
It is absolutely not true!

42:24.525 --> 42:26.300
You were afraid you'd
be found out. No.

42:26.360 --> 42:29.204
That your theory
would be discredited,

42:29.263 --> 42:32.176
a theory upon which you had
built your entire career,

42:32.233 --> 42:35.510
and that Mr. Rigg would be
shown for who he was,

42:35.569 --> 42:38.778
not as a good man
who just snapped,

42:39.273 --> 42:42.811
but as a violent individual,
a bully and a liar

42:42.877 --> 42:44.686
who was no more dissociative
than his daughter.

42:44.745 --> 42:45.780
VERDON: Objection.

42:51.752 --> 42:53.095
Withdrawn.

42:53.621 --> 42:55.362
I have no more questions
for this witness.

42:55.422 --> 42:56.765
(SOBBING)

43:04.699 --> 43:07.680
You turned this into the
trial of Dr. Leon Mayer.

43:07.735 --> 43:09.146
Whatever the jury
thinks of him,

43:09.203 --> 43:10.978
they'll take it
out on my client.

43:11.038 --> 43:14.042
You hitched your wagon to his theory.
Your mistake, not ours.

43:15.676 --> 43:16.711
Man one.

43:18.879 --> 43:21.223
Not until I hear
what she has to say.

43:29.823 --> 43:34.363
I needed him to help us with the appeal.
I thought he owed us.

43:36.931 --> 43:39.309
Dad told me to forget it,
but I couldn't.

43:40.868 --> 43:42.575
I tracked Mayer to his hotel.

43:42.636 --> 43:44.081
And you brought
the gun with you?

43:44.905 --> 43:46.782
Yes. Just to scare him.

43:48.809 --> 43:50.811
Uh, he wouldn't speak to me.

43:52.279 --> 43:55.749
I followed him everywhere,
the theater, the restaurant.

43:56.450 --> 43:58.452
I waited to talk to him.

44:01.589 --> 44:04.502
(SIGHS) When I thought he was going to
duck out the back of the restaurant,

44:04.558 --> 44:07.061
I went after him.

44:07.728 --> 44:12.074
I told him he was a bastard
for abandoning a good man.

44:15.369 --> 44:16.905
And he laughed.

44:20.174 --> 44:26.181
Said he wasn't the problem. The
problem was my father was a murderer.

44:30.417 --> 44:32.419
And then he went
into the restroom,

44:35.422 --> 44:37.595
and I didn't believe him.

44:38.759 --> 44:40.238
(CRYING) I couldn't.

44:46.700 --> 44:52.378
I was just so angry that I went
in there and started shooting,

45:01.615 --> 45:04.425
and then when
I saw that other man,

45:06.921 --> 45:09.527
I just kept on firing.

45:18.332 --> 45:20.539
I'm sorry. I didn't know...

45:31.078 --> 45:35.117
Murder two, 20-to-life.
That's the best I can do.

45:45.426 --> 45:48.202
Whole world says her father's a killer.
One man says he's sick.

45:48.262 --> 45:49.866
She heard what
she wanted to hear.

45:49.930 --> 45:51.568
We all do.

45:51.632 --> 45:54.636
Yeah, but we don't all
pay $40,000 to hear it.
