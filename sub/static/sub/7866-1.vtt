03:01.014 --> 03:01.754
Raftaar!

03:02.348 --> 03:05.158
- Balwinder.
- Coming, brother.

03:05.218 --> 03:06.629
Louder..

03:07.020 --> 03:09.022
Father, louder.
Balwinder Yes, brother.

03:10.256 --> 03:11.394
Why do I ever pass through this lane?

03:11.457 --> 03:14.529
<i>Shitara! Babli! Karan!</i>

03:14.594 --> 03:17.234
That Ranjit yells so loudly.

03:17.430 --> 03:20.274
What do you care? Eat your food.
Okay.

03:22.101 --> 03:24.672
50,000 rupees is missing
from my cupboard.

03:24.737 --> 03:26.307
Sukhi, have you seen it?

03:27.006 --> 03:27.746
Ballu?

03:28.374 --> 03:29.546
Where's Raftaar?

03:29.609 --> 03:30.649
He's been out all morning.

03:30.677 --> 03:32.281
The money was here till morning.

03:32.345 --> 03:33.483
That's the limit.

03:33.546 --> 03:35.048
Don't you trust your son?

03:35.148 --> 03:37.321
No, no... my son can
never do such a thing.

03:37.383 --> 03:39.659
He's my son and your daughter.

03:40.420 --> 03:41.057
Glutton.

03:41.154 --> 03:43.225
Raftaar was always useless
and good-for-nothing...

03:43.289 --> 03:44.768
and now he's also become a thief.

03:45.024 --> 03:48.198
No, uncle, Raftaar can never steal.

03:48.261 --> 03:52.038
Sister, I saw brother in front
of the cupboard in the morning.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.408
Come here, dear.

03:53.633 --> 03:55.408
Children never lie.

03:57.136 --> 03:58.342
Now repeat what you said.

03:59.405 --> 04:02.147
I saw father in the morning.

04:02.208 --> 04:03.016
What?

04:03.977 --> 04:05.012
You heard it wrong.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.388
I said father, not brother.

04:08.982 --> 04:11.019
Don't try to protect him.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.620
I know my son too well.

04:13.019 --> 04:14.498
And there goes the gun...

04:14.554 --> 04:15.658
The race has begun!

04:15.722 --> 04:17.257
Look at how they are racing.

04:17.322 --> 04:18.495
Towards the end line.

04:18.558 --> 04:22.267
And they have reached the end-line..

04:31.304 --> 04:33.181
"Boys, the winning team gets."

04:33.239 --> 04:35.048
"A cash reward and a Bullet."

04:35.108 --> 04:37.179
"And the losing team
gets Lots of love."

04:55.395 --> 04:57.807
"it goes tung-tung."

05:00.033 --> 05:02.274
"it goes tung-tung."

05:04.337 --> 05:07.011
"it sounds like tung-tung."

05:08.975 --> 05:11.182
"it sounds like tung-tung."

05:11.244 --> 05:13.315
"The stringed instrument."

05:13.379 --> 05:15.586
"In your and my heart,
it plays loud."

05:15.648 --> 05:17.753
"This stringed instrument today."

05:18.017 --> 05:20.156
"In your and my heart,
it plays loud."

05:20.219 --> 05:22.358
"This stringed instrument today."

05:22.422 --> 05:25.028
"it goes tung-tung."

05:27.026 --> 05:29.632
"it goes tung-tung."

05:31.464 --> 05:34.138
"it sounds like tung-tung."

05:36.035 --> 05:38.242
"it sounds like tung-tung."

05:38.304 --> 05:40.443
"The stringed instrument."

05:40.506 --> 05:42.679
"In your and my heart,
it plays loud."

05:42.742 --> 05:45.018
"This stringed instrument today."

05:45.044 --> 05:47.285
"In your and my heart,
it plays loud."

05:47.347 --> 05:49.588
"This stringed instrument today."

05:50.183 --> 05:52.220
"A beautiful atmosphere is set."

05:53.786 --> 05:55.390
"Damsels are dancing."

05:56.389 --> 05:59.063
"Now I will... Pull the tractor
with my teeth and show you."

06:15.675 --> 06:16.653
"Bravo.."

06:16.709 --> 06:20.020
"Gungh-gungh, it goes."

06:20.079 --> 06:21.251
"The drum speaks."

06:21.314 --> 06:24.420
"Gungh-gungh, it goes."

06:24.484 --> 06:25.690
"And the heart skips a beat."

06:25.752 --> 06:29.097
"Gungh-gungh, it goes."

06:29.155 --> 06:30.225
"The drum speaks."

06:30.289 --> 06:33.566
"Gungh-gungh, it goes."

06:33.626 --> 06:35.037
"And the heart skips a beat."

06:35.094 --> 06:38.541
"Then the drum revealed..."

06:39.432 --> 06:41.469
"Then the drum revealed..."

06:41.534 --> 06:43.775
"Look how well they dance!"

06:44.036 --> 06:46.107
"Then the drum revealed..."

06:46.172 --> 06:48.379
"All the secrets of
stringed instrument."

06:48.441 --> 06:50.512
"Amidst the drum and
the stringed instrument."

06:50.576 --> 06:52.385
"Without me, alone"

06:52.445 --> 06:55.289
"how will you"

06:59.585 --> 07:02.156
"it sounds like tung-tung."

07:04.090 --> 07:06.263
"it sounds like tung-tung."

07:06.459 --> 07:08.496
"Along with the Gungh-gungh."

07:08.561 --> 07:10.734
"In your and my heart,
it plays loud."

07:10.997 --> 07:13.136
"This stringed instrument today."

07:13.199 --> 07:15.304
"In your and my heart,
it plays loud."

07:15.368 --> 07:17.507
"This stringed instrument today."

07:17.570 --> 07:19.743
"In your and my heart.."

07:20.006 --> 07:21.679
"In your and my heart.."

07:22.175 --> 07:24.621
"In your and my heart,
it plays loud."

07:29.015 --> 07:33.018
"Oh ring,
the trees are bearing fruits."

07:33.019 --> 07:35.021
"My beloved stays far away."

07:35.121 --> 07:36.464
"Oh ring, listen to me, I pray."

07:36.522 --> 07:40.664
"I tried hard to make him stay."

08:18.631 --> 08:21.635
Why aren't you dancing now?

08:23.135 --> 08:25.342
This is what you're good for.

08:25.404 --> 08:26.576
You're good for nothing.

08:26.639 --> 08:28.243
It didn't matter
that he humiliated me.

08:28.307 --> 08:30.116
But why did he have
to humiliate himself?

08:30.176 --> 08:31.018
What?

08:31.177 --> 08:31.985
Yes.

08:32.010 --> 08:34.217
And he even kicked me.

08:34.280 --> 08:37.090
It's true you're useless,
good-for-nothing.

08:37.149 --> 08:39.424
These villagers
know how to have fun..

08:39.485 --> 08:41.328
But they also work hard.

08:41.486 --> 08:44.400
But all you do is party hard.

08:44.624 --> 08:47.730
When will you realize
your responsibilities?

08:47.994 --> 08:49.337
Get lost.

08:49.629 --> 08:53.600
All you do is hog food all day,
squander money.

08:53.666 --> 08:56.010
Let me see you earn a single penny.

08:56.402 --> 08:58.245
Go find a job.

08:58.504 --> 09:00.347
Are you listening or not?

09:01.040 --> 09:02.713
Curse you... I'll teach you a lesson.

09:02.975 --> 09:05.683
If you can even clean the
cow-shed properly everyday..

09:05.945 --> 09:07.652
I wouldn't have to worry.

09:08.114 --> 09:09.252
- Mom..
- Yeah!

09:09.315 --> 09:12.159
Father was saying
that I hog all day.

09:12.218 --> 09:15.199
Do I really hog all day?

09:15.988 --> 09:18.696
No, son... you don't hog all day.

09:19.125 --> 09:21.571
Your eyelids are flickering,
you're lying.

09:22.061 --> 09:23.631
Yours are too.

09:23.696 --> 09:26.677
I did everything only for
the betterment of the village.

09:26.732 --> 09:28.643
- Tell her.
- He's right.

09:28.701 --> 09:30.408
This is the first time
when father taunted me..

09:30.469 --> 09:32.005
For my unemployment.

09:32.271 --> 09:33.978
He must have said it
in a fit of rage.

09:34.006 --> 09:36.282
No...

09:36.342 --> 09:37.377
Mom.

09:37.677 --> 09:39.384
I swear...

09:39.445 --> 09:44.690
Look here. - Yes.
I swear... that I will find a job.

09:44.750 --> 09:45.751
Just wait a watch.

10:03.002 --> 10:04.242
Raftaar! Raftaar!

10:04.303 --> 10:05.543
I completely forgot.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.685
Today's the last day of
admission in my son's school.

10:07.707 --> 10:09.311
And the Mayor's coming today.

10:09.375 --> 10:11.335
For the inauguration
ceremony of the African Lion.

10:11.344 --> 10:14.257
Please help me out. Please.
Of course, anything for friends.

10:14.313 --> 10:15.153
What do I have to do?

10:15.181 --> 10:18.526
You have to guard the African Lion.

10:18.751 --> 10:21.789
Mr. Lion, can you spare two minutes.
Someone wants to meet you.

10:22.355 --> 10:23.459
Here. Here.

10:23.522 --> 10:24.694
Singh... Lion!

10:26.158 --> 10:27.262
Lion... Singh!

10:28.761 --> 10:30.061
Who is it now?

10:30.062 --> 10:30.733
Oh God!

10:30.796 --> 10:31.836
I'm on my way, 15 minutes.

10:32.064 --> 10:33.236
15 minutes...

10:33.299 --> 10:35.279
The Mayor and other
bureaucrats will be attending.

10:35.334 --> 10:36.711
Just handle everything.
Lam coming.

10:36.769 --> 10:38.077
15 minutes.
- Listen.

10:38.170 --> 10:39.547
Come soon.

10:44.076 --> 10:44.781
The door is open.

10:47.346 --> 10:48.450
Mufasa!

10:50.583 --> 10:51.618
Where did he go?

10:52.084 --> 10:54.496
Mufasa! Mufasa!

10:57.323 --> 10:59.735
Hello, sir... Welcome.

10:59.792 --> 11:01.032
Oh no...

11:01.093 --> 11:02.094
Mufasa!

11:24.417 --> 11:26.328
Wonderful! Wonderful!

11:26.385 --> 11:27.659
Calm down! Calm down!

11:27.787 --> 11:31.257
Punjab, the land of Lions!

11:31.323 --> 11:33.701
And especially from Africa..

11:33.759 --> 11:38.037
We've brought a lion for you,
which will..

11:38.064 --> 11:39.771
Make you hold your breaths.

11:41.634 --> 11:43.375
Mr. Mayor, hold this.

11:44.170 --> 11:45.171
Sorry.

11:49.508 --> 11:51.784
Clap!

12:07.093 --> 12:09.039
Did the lion walk
all the way from Africa?

12:09.128 --> 12:10.436
Looks humiliating.

12:10.496 --> 12:13.272
When this lion roars...

12:13.332 --> 12:20.341
it makes people shiver.

12:20.606 --> 12:25.487
They shudder... shudder with fear.

12:25.644 --> 12:29.751
Security...
make him roar for the people.

12:33.119 --> 12:36.589
Security... tell him to roar!

12:36.655 --> 12:39.397
- Him?
- Yes, him.

12:46.565 --> 12:48.203
It's a dog!

12:48.267 --> 12:49.803
Yes...

12:52.404 --> 12:55.044
That's not a lion!

13:00.479 --> 13:03.016
You... That's a dog.

13:03.115 --> 13:05.618
I will put you in a cage.

13:05.684 --> 13:08.255
Move the cameras, what are you doing?
Who called the press here?

13:08.320 --> 13:10.163
I won't spare you.

13:10.222 --> 13:13.135
No, photographs.
I will have this dog bite you.

13:13.192 --> 13:14.398
You'll be injected..

13:14.460 --> 13:16.098
What if the lion doesn't return?

13:16.162 --> 13:18.108
I want the lion back.

13:18.597 --> 13:20.668
Hey... stop. Stop.

13:27.473 --> 13:29.146
You and your plans.

13:30.676 --> 13:34.453
The person you're trying
to call is driving at the moment.

13:34.513 --> 13:36.493
Please call next month..

13:36.549 --> 13:38.222
- Raftaar.
- Yes.

13:38.284 --> 13:39.684
I gave you such a small job to do..

13:39.718 --> 13:40.628
But you messed that up too.

13:40.686 --> 13:44.055
It wasn't my fault,
you left the cage door open.

13:44.056 --> 13:45.592
You could've closed the door.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.729
Wasn't much to do.
What is this?

13:48.160 --> 13:50.071
Do something... find the lion..

13:50.129 --> 13:51.301
And bring him before the Mayor.

13:51.363 --> 13:53.309
Where will I find him?
Just find him from anywhere..

13:53.365 --> 13:54.537
Or else I will lose my job.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.375
But I am losing mine too.

13:56.435 --> 13:57.743
I am going...

13:58.370 --> 13:59.508
Everyone's troubling me.

13:59.572 --> 14:01.552
Listen... He hung up.

14:03.108 --> 14:06.021
This must be the first
lion that cost me my job.

14:06.645 --> 14:09.251
What kind of remix is this?

14:39.111 --> 14:41.148
You dressed up a
dog to look like a lion.

14:41.213 --> 14:43.489
Isn't this misguiding
the innocent people?

14:43.549 --> 14:44.687
The country wants to know.

14:44.750 --> 14:48.197
I.. - Mr. Mayor, will you appoint
a committee to find the lion?

14:48.254 --> 14:50.325
One minute...

14:51.490 --> 14:53.436
- Hello..
- Mayor sir.

14:57.062 --> 14:58.666
How dare you come here?

14:58.731 --> 15:00.039
I warned you..

15:03.002 --> 15:05.278
Sir, I've brought him along.
What?

15:05.337 --> 15:06.213
Donkey?

15:08.173 --> 15:09.675
Lion, sir.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.088
Are you crazy?

15:15.147 --> 15:16.524
Come, Mufasa. Come.

15:19.718 --> 15:21.493
You climbed on
the table out of fear.

15:21.553 --> 15:22.623
Don't be scared, sir.

15:22.688 --> 15:25.225
He's a very tame lion,
even I was scared of him first.

15:25.291 --> 15:27.100
Why did you bring him here?

15:27.159 --> 15:31.005
Listen to me. Look at him,
he already likes you a lot.

15:31.030 --> 15:32.737
Look, he's even apologizing.

15:32.998 --> 15:34.170
He's staring at me.

15:34.233 --> 15:37.612
Mommy!
Sir, please don't fire my friend.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.206
I won't fire your friend.
I will give him my job.

15:39.271 --> 15:40.147
I'll make him the Mayor.

15:40.205 --> 15:41.741
Don't joke with me, sir.

15:42.007 --> 15:43.368
Mommy!
You can keep your lion, sir.

15:43.409 --> 15:46.481
Listen to me, take him away.
All of you, please explain my sir.

15:46.545 --> 15:48.115
Someone give a bone to the lion.

15:49.315 --> 15:50.760
Mayor sir, you keep him.

15:51.016 --> 15:53.121
- Mayor sir.
- I beg you...

15:53.185 --> 15:55.756
Listen to me,
even I was scared at first.

15:56.555 --> 15:58.557
He's fainted. See you.

15:58.624 --> 16:01.366
I am tying him here, keep him.

16:01.427 --> 16:02.497
Okay...

16:02.995 --> 16:03.700
Hello.

16:04.063 --> 16:05.064
See you all.

16:05.731 --> 16:07.301
Brother, listen to me.

16:07.599 --> 16:09.704
Mommy!

16:10.269 --> 16:11.976
He's made my life hell.

16:12.004 --> 16:14.348
I cannot tolerate him anymore.

16:14.406 --> 16:16.613
I cannot stay here any longer.

16:16.675 --> 16:18.518
Eat your food quietly.

16:18.577 --> 16:21.114
That's all I'm good for these days.

16:21.146 --> 16:23.183
If you can't make us proud..

16:23.215 --> 16:24.922
Then at least don't humiliate us.

16:25.017 --> 16:26.496
You shouldn't be even
let out of your room.

16:26.552 --> 16:29.226
Harpeet...
Please don't advocate him.

16:29.455 --> 16:31.128
Come. Go to your room.

16:31.190 --> 16:33.500
And you won't get
food all day today.

16:35.361 --> 16:39.002
Save this pretence for
someone who doesn't know you two.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.670
You've never completed anything.

16:44.737 --> 16:46.216
You left your studies in between.

16:46.271 --> 16:47.872
Stopped working in
the fields in mid-way.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.281
Quit your job in the middle.

16:49.341 --> 16:51.719
But now you must
completely leave home.

16:51.777 --> 16:53.279
- Understand.
- You're right...

16:53.345 --> 16:54.653
"If you ever make
such a mistake again"

16:54.713 --> 16:56.047
you will have to leave home.

16:56.048 --> 16:58.585
No... he has to go now.

16:59.785 --> 17:01.128
What are you saying?

17:01.186 --> 17:03.097
You have only two options.

17:03.622 --> 17:06.364
Either you take up a decent
job at my friend's place in Goa.

17:06.425 --> 17:09.234
Or marry Navjot's daughter Sweety.

17:09.294 --> 17:10.465
Understand?

17:10.662 --> 17:11.696
Yes.

17:24.443 --> 17:26.616
Raftaar.

17:27.346 --> 17:31.726
He wants me to marry a girl...
that's only good for wrestling.

17:32.317 --> 17:34.092
There are no options.

17:37.689 --> 17:40.431
Mom. Why are you crying?

17:40.559 --> 17:42.596
Don't you know your father?

17:43.128 --> 17:45.108
Once he's decided something...

17:45.731 --> 17:47.031
What does he want?

17:47.032 --> 17:48.306
That I should go to Goa?

17:48.634 --> 17:50.204
I'll go happily.

17:53.138 --> 17:54.708
Come on..

17:58.610 --> 18:00.089
God bless you.

18:01.346 --> 18:03.417
I hope you won't quit
this job in the middle?

18:04.450 --> 18:06.430
"You don't lack anything"

18:06.985 --> 18:08.259
except for concentration.

18:09.288 --> 18:11.427
I am not sending you
away because I've lost.

18:11.490 --> 18:13.094
I am sending you away because I know..

18:13.158 --> 18:15.229
You're capable of doing much more.

18:15.294 --> 18:17.501
And I want you to recognize yourself.

18:17.963 --> 18:20.671
If you delay,
you have a lot to lose.

18:21.500 --> 18:22.478
Understand.

18:23.235 --> 18:24.179
Now go.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.485
Welcome... son, welcome.

18:30.542 --> 18:33.022
Father, he's leaving.

19:07.179 --> 19:08.453
Hello, Mr. Rana?

19:08.981 --> 19:11.427
I am arriving at your
stud farm for a meeting.

20:04.169 --> 20:05.341
I'm too good.

20:05.404 --> 20:07.213
Welcome, Gentlemen.

20:07.272 --> 20:09.252
Just because we're
in the weapon's business..

20:09.308 --> 20:12.255
"Does not mean we've
to be at war with each other."

20:12.477 --> 20:14.582
Let's divide our territories.

20:14.646 --> 20:17.559
Mr. Nelson, you take eastern Europe.

20:17.616 --> 20:19.653
Mr. Wong, you take Asia.

20:20.018 --> 20:21.156
And you sir, Russia.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.460
Anthony, my friend.

20:22.554 --> 20:23.726
Africa's yours.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.763
This is the only
way to stop bloodshed.

20:26.024 --> 20:29.198
No loss of profit,
no loss of life.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.137
Deal.

20:36.201 --> 20:37.407
That's the spirit.

20:38.303 --> 20:39.043
Cheers.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.744
Cheers to our unity.

20:40.806 --> 20:41.511
Cheers.

20:43.308 --> 20:44.753
I like the way you ride...

20:48.080 --> 20:49.081
the horse.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.288
Hi!

20:53.151 --> 20:55.256
I love the way you smell.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.068
And your calves are just...

21:11.103 --> 21:13.379
Don't ever try
to act smart with me.

21:13.672 --> 21:15.174
Sorry, Mr. Rana.

21:28.553 --> 21:29.554
Sorry.

21:35.060 --> 21:39.372
I can't tolerate anyone
misbehaving with my daughter.

23:38.283 --> 23:39.193
Mark!

23:43.021 --> 23:43.761
Mark!

23:54.132 --> 23:55.509
Dad. Dad.

23:57.269 --> 23:59.180
- You...
- No, no, no, dad.

23:59.237 --> 24:00.978
How can I kill you?

24:01.006 --> 24:03.111
That's why I told him to kill you.

24:03.675 --> 24:05.712
But this really pains me.

24:06.545 --> 24:08.218
But it was more painful..

24:08.280 --> 24:10.988
When you asked me to
apologies in front of everyone.

24:11.983 --> 24:14.327
You've grown old, dad.

24:14.686 --> 24:17.326
That's why you're happy
with the little you have.

24:18.623 --> 24:20.694
But I want to make it big, dad.

24:21.993 --> 24:24.200
I want total control, dad.

24:24.463 --> 24:27.569
Dad! Hey dad! Dad! Dad!

24:28.767 --> 24:30.440
It's best you die, dad.

24:30.702 --> 24:32.375
Good for you.

24:33.004 --> 24:35.314
Better for me.

24:37.409 --> 24:39.719
- Dad...
- Sir, he's dead.

24:42.647 --> 24:44.058
I'm too good.

24:52.757 --> 24:54.668
It's my time, dad.

24:58.296 --> 25:00.207
Sara, Mark has gone mad.

25:00.265 --> 25:02.211
You must leave for the US.

25:02.267 --> 25:03.473
I won't go to the US.

25:03.535 --> 25:05.674
Darling, it's only until
all this gets sorted out.

25:05.737 --> 25:07.004
You'll be safe there.

25:07.005 --> 25:09.349
Even now you want
to get rid of your problem..

25:09.407 --> 25:11.011
And not face it.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.750
I'll go wherever I want to.

25:20.252 --> 25:22.129
I know where Sara will go.

25:22.187 --> 25:23.632
Call Kirpal.

25:53.018 --> 25:55.624
I know who sent the money and why.

25:58.356 --> 26:00.632
You just rejected
500 million in 5 seconds.

26:01.059 --> 26:02.367
Such an expensive mistake.

26:02.427 --> 26:03.269
Out!

26:03.328 --> 26:06.332
Piku, that old man refused
an offer of 500 million.

26:06.398 --> 26:08.537
I wonder what the boss
is going to do with him?

26:14.239 --> 26:16.617
Hello. Wrong number.
It's just a phone.

26:18.009 --> 26:19.079
Come on.

26:19.744 --> 26:20.984
Stop.

26:21.012 --> 26:22.389
We're guest of Mr. Kirpal.

26:22.447 --> 26:23.323
Okay, hold.

26:23.381 --> 26:24.553
Sir, two men are here to see you.

26:24.616 --> 26:26.095
And one Sardar.

26:26.318 --> 26:28.264
- You mean three people.
- Yes.

26:28.320 --> 26:29.458
Send them upstairs.

26:29.521 --> 26:31.125
Send them upstairs.

26:31.356 --> 26:32.232
On the deck.

26:32.290 --> 26:34.292
I am not your father's friend.

26:34.993 --> 26:36.768
This is the address father gave me.

26:37.495 --> 26:40.032
Hey... First listen to me.

26:40.332 --> 26:43.370
I mean I am your father's friend..

26:43.435 --> 26:45.210
But out here I am your boss.

26:45.270 --> 26:46.112
Ha... Ha...

26:46.171 --> 26:47.673
- Who are these two?
- Friends.

26:47.739 --> 26:48.779
You two stand at the back.

26:49.040 --> 26:50.610
Go and stand at the back.

26:50.775 --> 26:52.755
And you...
stand at the end of this line.

26:53.011 --> 26:53.580
Yes.

26:57.215 --> 27:00.094
Do you know how much
time it takes to get her?

27:03.388 --> 27:05.061
5 seconds if I walk.

27:07.292 --> 27:08.737
And 2 seconds if I run.

27:12.998 --> 27:14.272
You must do as I say.

27:14.332 --> 27:15.709
That's what father said too.

27:15.967 --> 27:18.106
There's a rule to get
recruited here. - What?

27:18.169 --> 27:20.342
Go to that railing and jump.

27:26.678 --> 27:27.622
What did you do?

27:27.679 --> 27:29.681
Boss said
"Go to that railing and jump".

27:30.015 --> 27:31.016
And I did.

27:33.151 --> 27:35.028
'Go to that railing and jump.'

27:41.026 --> 27:41.561
He's smart!

27:48.366 --> 27:51.279
Raftaar, I'm giving
you a very important job.

27:52.103 --> 27:53.309
You need to go to Goa airport.

27:53.371 --> 27:54.145
Yes.

27:56.408 --> 27:57.113
Take this.

27:57.175 --> 27:58.381
A girl called Sara...

27:58.576 --> 28:01.216
- Singh. Where?
- Goa airport.

28:01.279 --> 28:02.656
Come back.

28:05.216 --> 28:07.127
First hear me out.

28:07.952 --> 28:09.329
You've to be at the
airport tomorrow 11 am.

28:09.387 --> 28:11.298
But there's lot of
time for that. - Yeah.

28:11.356 --> 28:12.562
Sit.

28:14.626 --> 28:16.537
Listen to me carefully, son.

28:16.961 --> 28:19.441
A girl called Sara
is arriving from Romania.

28:19.497 --> 28:20.669
She's my guest.

28:21.299 --> 28:24.610
You'll be with her
until she goes back.

28:24.669 --> 28:26.205
And take good care of her.

28:26.538 --> 28:29.451
She doesn't know Hindi,
do you know English?

28:29.507 --> 28:30.417
No.

28:32.377 --> 28:34.015
You don't know English?

28:35.113 --> 28:36.285
What are you doing here?

28:36.548 --> 28:38.152
What are you doing in Goa?
Get lost.

28:38.216 --> 28:39.593
Go back to Punjab.
Back to Punjab!

28:48.760 --> 28:49.670
Come on.

28:50.228 --> 28:51.434
Come on.

28:53.631 --> 28:54.735
I do know English.

28:54.999 --> 28:56.137
A to Z.

28:56.701 --> 28:58.044
Good.

29:00.004 --> 29:01.574
Keys to the Panjim bungalow.

29:03.341 --> 29:06.447
I'm giving you this
because I trust you.

29:06.511 --> 29:07.717
Don't worry, sir.

29:08.279 --> 29:10.452
Even I trust myself completely.

29:10.949 --> 29:11.620
Jai Hind!

29:13.051 --> 29:13.961
What a character.

29:20.959 --> 29:23.166
Hey, Singh. Get the key.

29:32.170 --> 29:33.205
Stupid.

29:33.705 --> 29:36.686
I lied... that I know English.

29:37.408 --> 29:39.183
I don't know what to do.

29:41.012 --> 29:44.186
I'll arrange for someone...
who knows Hindi and English.

29:44.249 --> 29:45.353
Don't worry.

29:45.650 --> 29:46.560
Let's go ahead.

29:46.618 --> 29:47.562
Come on.

29:58.429 --> 29:59.237
Careful.

29:59.297 --> 30:01.470
Aunty, brother Daljeet's calling.

30:01.533 --> 30:03.444
Son... how are you?

30:03.501 --> 30:05.139
Nothing's good out here, mom.

30:05.336 --> 30:07.509
Neither the food,
nor the place or the ambiance.

30:08.006 --> 30:10.008
I haven't even slept
properly since I got here.

30:10.041 --> 30:12.317
You haven't slept? Are you sick?

30:12.377 --> 30:15.017
I could never sleep
without hearing your voice.

30:16.281 --> 30:17.692
Then call me every night.

30:17.749 --> 30:19.524
I can't see your face on the phone.

30:19.584 --> 30:21.757
I maybe here,
but I'm still with you.

30:22.253 --> 30:25.063
Concentrate on your job,
and everything will be fine.

30:25.356 --> 30:27.563
Fine, mom. Take care.

30:32.597 --> 30:35.237
Raftaar, my room's really amazing.

30:39.370 --> 30:41.213
He's sad and you're dancing.

30:42.807 --> 30:44.150
Sorry, bro.

31:54.812 --> 31:56.723
- Hi.
- Hi.

32:14.032 --> 32:15.033
Now she will come.

32:15.233 --> 32:17.144
- Band.
- Let them go.

32:17.468 --> 32:18.708
Go, Go.

32:26.778 --> 32:29.258
You idiots,
you're here to receive me.

32:34.252 --> 32:36.027
Raftaar... insult.

32:36.054 --> 32:39.524
We're here to receive you,
doesn't mean we're your servants.

32:39.590 --> 32:41.399
What you did with him..

32:41.459 --> 32:43.564
If you do it again...

32:44.228 --> 32:45.707
You'll face my wrath.

32:45.763 --> 32:46.639
Yes,

32:51.069 --> 32:54.050
Raftaar, you two look
really nice together.

33:16.761 --> 33:19.571
She's a guest, not my type.

33:21.566 --> 33:23.239
This girl's got an attitude problem.

33:23.301 --> 33:25.645
I'll show her. Wear your belt.

33:27.138 --> 33:30.119
Raftaar, get ready.

34:08.212 --> 34:10.692
"You kicked me out of this Casino"

34:11.014 --> 34:12.619
and now I'm offering to buy it.

34:12.683 --> 34:15.129
And this time my offer is 750 million.

34:15.186 --> 34:18.292
I threw you out because
you got involved in drugs.

34:18.523 --> 34:21.402
And now you want to buy
my Casino with that money.

34:21.525 --> 34:23.027
You think I'll let that happen.

34:27.732 --> 34:28.472
Hey, stop.

34:29.167 --> 34:31.147
I want to meet Kirpal.
You can't.

34:31.202 --> 34:32.203
He's in a meeting with Boxer Bhai.

34:32.270 --> 34:33.510
What about him?

34:39.210 --> 34:40.313
Who's the girl?

34:40.378 --> 34:41.413
She wants to meet Kirpal.

34:41.478 --> 34:43.049
- What?
- She's from Romania.

34:43.347 --> 34:45.418
Next time there won't be an offer...

34:45.783 --> 34:47.056
I'll just help myself in.

34:47.150 --> 34:47.686
Wait.

34:54.324 --> 34:56.065
Your time is up.

34:56.594 --> 35:00.667
You should retire, go to
Canada and buy a mall or something.

35:26.524 --> 35:28.003
How is your father?

35:29.193 --> 35:30.035
Good.

35:30.394 --> 35:31.634
I thought you're
not safe in the hotel..

35:31.696 --> 35:33.403
So I put you in my bungalow.

35:34.599 --> 35:35.543
Thank you.

35:36.400 --> 35:38.676
If you have any problem,
you can tell Singh.

35:43.474 --> 35:45.613
Don't worry,
I'll take care of myself.

35:46.144 --> 35:48.454
He may be silly but
he's very dependable.

36:09.567 --> 36:10.739
Insulted again.

36:15.373 --> 36:16.716
That's our bag!

36:19.710 --> 36:22.691
Stop. Stop the car.

36:25.516 --> 36:27.189
This is your room.

36:27.251 --> 36:30.425
It's got a balcony..
Cupboard...

36:30.488 --> 36:31.694
Bathroom...

36:35.726 --> 36:37.706
Did you show her, her room?

36:38.196 --> 36:39.607
She's got an attitude.

36:39.664 --> 36:41.371
Keep her away from me.

36:41.999 --> 36:42.534
Hey...

36:44.435 --> 36:45.675
Your room's that way.

36:45.736 --> 36:47.443
What are you doing here?
Raftaar.

36:49.740 --> 36:51.276
That girl left her room..

36:52.043 --> 36:53.147
She's here.

36:53.778 --> 36:56.019
Open the door,
don't make me mad.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.056
See.

36:58.583 --> 36:59.493
See.

36:59.717 --> 37:00.991
I'll show her.

37:08.693 --> 37:11.503
Why does my future seem
in the dark?

37:14.432 --> 37:16.605
This girl isn't
taking us seriously.

37:16.667 --> 37:18.146
I'll show her.

37:22.506 --> 37:25.749
Stop the truck. My bag.

37:26.010 --> 37:27.683
Stop.

37:47.665 --> 37:52.205
Sir, Sara has left Romania..

37:52.270 --> 37:54.716
And nobody knows which
part of the world she's in.

37:54.772 --> 37:56.445
That's good news.

37:56.507 --> 37:57.383
You know...

37:57.441 --> 38:02.049
If she had been here,
I would've caught her and killed her.

38:02.346 --> 38:03.381
Finish!

38:04.248 --> 38:05.625
No glamour.

38:05.983 --> 38:08.361
Easy is boring man.

38:12.423 --> 38:15.302
She'll hide and I'll find her.

38:15.660 --> 38:18.607
She'll run and I'll hunt her.

38:21.365 --> 38:22.309
I like it.

38:31.142 --> 38:33.349
This is an old way
to show-off your brawn.

38:33.978 --> 38:35.252
But it's effective.

38:37.448 --> 38:38.085
Come on.

38:45.523 --> 38:48.732
You and you...
scream when I say.

38:48.993 --> 38:50.370
- Get it.
- Yes.

39:08.546 --> 39:09.991
She's coming.

39:10.081 --> 39:11.321
And now...

39:11.382 --> 39:12.622
Hit me.

39:12.683 --> 39:14.390
Wait... that's the fake one, right?

39:14.452 --> 39:15.226
Yes, it's fake.

39:15.286 --> 39:16.629
That's the real one.

39:17.188 --> 39:18.360
That's the real one. Okay.

39:19.290 --> 39:20.098
Hit me.

39:38.743 --> 39:40.188
Now it's my turn.

39:40.544 --> 39:43.024
Come here, and turn around.

39:51.222 --> 39:52.758
Be strong. Be strong.

40:13.377 --> 40:16.153
I was here for the
job of a translator.

40:16.213 --> 40:17.453
I guess I am at the wrong address.

40:17.515 --> 40:18.118
Hey!

40:18.182 --> 40:19.684
Hey specky, come here.

40:22.486 --> 40:25.729
Drink Rasna...
it'll cool your mind.

40:35.766 --> 40:36.710
It's cool.

40:37.501 --> 40:38.479
Bye!

40:42.540 --> 40:43.746
Hi.

40:43.808 --> 40:45.253
What's your name?

40:45.309 --> 40:46.219
Emily.

40:47.211 --> 40:48.281
Imli?

40:49.680 --> 40:51.318
That's a tart name.

40:52.683 --> 40:54.685
Ask her...
what's she doing in Goa?

40:55.653 --> 40:57.155
Why have you come to Goa?

40:57.221 --> 40:59.064
It's none of his business.

40:59.089 --> 41:01.296
'She'll get herself
killed and me too.'

41:03.561 --> 41:07.509
She... likes to see new places,
eat new food..

41:07.565 --> 41:10.011
And make new friends.

41:10.034 --> 41:11.513
She's here to make friends.

41:12.369 --> 41:14.280
Does she know all of us?

41:15.105 --> 41:16.641
Do you know who they are?

41:19.310 --> 41:22.223
Morons! Three morons.

41:24.482 --> 41:27.691
Great... great people.

41:30.554 --> 41:32.431
The idea's working.

41:32.490 --> 41:33.730
Did she understand?
Do you want to call the cops?

41:33.791 --> 41:37.705
Hey... don't try to get too friendly.

41:37.761 --> 41:40.708
Tell her... if she needs
to get anything done in Goa..

41:40.764 --> 41:42.766
Then speak to me.

41:49.073 --> 41:50.051
Let's go.

41:51.208 --> 41:55.088
If you want anything done...
he can do anything in Goa.

42:00.584 --> 42:02.393
But what do we
do with this woman?

42:02.586 --> 42:06.500
She wants you to help
her find this woman.

42:07.224 --> 42:09.500
Tell her not to worry,
it'll be clone.

42:09.560 --> 42:10.504
Tell her.

42:11.028 --> 42:13.338
He said don't worry...
he will help you find her.

42:13.764 --> 42:14.572
<i>Pappi.</i>

42:15.533 --> 42:16.443
Take a look.

42:18.002 --> 42:18.707
Show him as well.

42:20.471 --> 42:23.008
You will have to worry
if you don't find her.

42:23.741 --> 42:25.243
I will break your bones.

42:33.017 --> 42:35.520
She has faith in
your strong shoulders.

42:40.024 --> 42:41.196
- Raftaar!
- Raftaar!

42:43.427 --> 42:46.271
What? - We're hungry,
how about we get something to eat.

42:49.199 --> 42:51.577
She said... she likes
to see new places.

42:52.703 --> 42:54.546
Let's take her out,
let's eat out.

42:54.605 --> 42:55.413
- Yes.
- Let's go.

43:11.121 --> 43:12.998
Why the hell
is he blushing so much?

43:13.624 --> 43:14.762
What did she say?

43:15.259 --> 43:19.571
She's saying you've got
the best smile she's ever seen.

43:22.199 --> 43:24.236
Got her! Got her! Got her!

43:29.440 --> 43:31.442
Tell her she's very beautiful.

43:31.508 --> 43:33.181
Jesus, what did you get me into?

43:33.243 --> 43:35.154
Come on... tell her now.
Tell her...

43:36.513 --> 43:40.017
Tell her.
He says you're very beautiful.

43:42.686 --> 43:46.224
If he flirts with me...
I will kick him.

43:53.564 --> 43:54.634
What did she say?

43:55.366 --> 43:57.710
She expects a lot from you.

43:58.168 --> 44:00.045
She's got great hopes.

44:01.972 --> 44:03.178
A

44:04.174 --> 44:05.209
Hope.

44:07.011 --> 44:08.490
Have you got money?

44:08.545 --> 44:10.149
I didn't bring my purse.

44:10.214 --> 44:11.318
Raftaar's got...

44:11.382 --> 44:13.384
Raftaar! Raftaar!

44:13.450 --> 44:14.520
Raftaar!

44:14.585 --> 44:16.258
- Raftaar!
- Raftaar!

44:17.221 --> 44:18.427
He's lost in his dreams again.

44:18.489 --> 44:20.662
Let's follow him
and take Imli along.

44:20.724 --> 44:22.328
What? Why?

44:22.393 --> 44:24.498
You'll explain Raftaar's song to Sara.

44:24.561 --> 44:25.539
Come on.

44:25.596 --> 44:26.472
"Beat!"

44:32.770 --> 44:33.714
"Banjo."

44:40.110 --> 44:41.054
"Sing."

44:46.183 --> 44:48.163
"Singh... Sing."

44:48.218 --> 44:52.030
"Baby your love's
completely floored me."

44:52.056 --> 44:55.367
"Don't make me wait too long."

44:59.063 --> 45:02.442
"After locking my eyes with yours."

45:02.499 --> 45:06.174
"I've entered the game of love."

45:06.236 --> 45:09.376
"He wants to say...
that he loves you well."

45:09.440 --> 45:13.252
"Now you got to tell
him something too."

45:13.310 --> 45:16.587
"In every way,
I just want to say."

45:16.647 --> 45:20.288
"That you are the one,
baby I love you."

45:20.350 --> 45:23.024
"Hearing you agree..."

45:23.120 --> 45:24.190
"My heart goes..."

45:26.523 --> 45:27.695
"My heart goes..."

45:30.227 --> 45:31.297
"My heart goes..."

45:33.764 --> 45:35.243
"My heart says..."

45:37.367 --> 45:38.505
"My heart says..."

45:41.038 --> 45:42.210
"My heart says..."

45:59.223 --> 45:59.792
"Bro..."

46:00.023 --> 46:03.163
"You seem like an angel to me."

46:03.227 --> 46:07.004
"Your voice casts a spell on me."

46:10.434 --> 46:13.745
"I just see an angel baby,
whenever I look at you."

46:13.971 --> 46:17.544
"When I hear your magic
it's making me crazy too."

46:17.608 --> 46:21.613
"I'm going to hold
you tight in my arms."

46:21.678 --> 46:25.216
"Just keep staring
at me with a smile."

46:25.282 --> 46:28.024
"After falling
in love with you.."

46:28.118 --> 46:29.358
"My heart goes..."

46:31.355 --> 46:32.595
"My heart goes..."

46:35.025 --> 46:36.197
"My heart goes..."

46:38.529 --> 46:39.633
"My heart goes..."

46:42.232 --> 46:43.267
"My heart goes..."

46:45.669 --> 46:47.012
"My heart goes..."

46:49.473 --> 46:50.611
"Let it go.."

46:51.308 --> 46:52.286
"Let it go.."

46:52.342 --> 46:55.050
"Sway to the beat
and lets sing and dance."

46:55.112 --> 46:56.022
"Let it go.."

46:56.647 --> 46:57.591
"Let it go.."

46:58.582 --> 46:59.526
"Let it go.."

46:59.583 --> 47:01.290
"Sway to the beat and.."

47:01.351 --> 47:02.056
"Don't stop."

47:02.119 --> 47:02.688
"Let it go.."

47:02.953 --> 47:05.695
"Your intoxication.."

47:06.190 --> 47:07.999
"Bro... take it slow."

47:08.058 --> 47:11.403
"My queen,
this is the grandeur of your king."

47:11.461 --> 47:15.409
"Only you look good alongside
this handsome Singh."

47:18.702 --> 47:20.409
"I'm your king,
and you're my queen.."

47:20.470 --> 47:22.381
"..and that's the
way it's supposed to be."

47:22.439 --> 47:24.009
"Now you're standing
with your Singh.."

47:24.107 --> 47:26.178
"..because you look
best when you're with me."

47:26.610 --> 47:30.114
"With your beautiful
face dwelling in my eyes."

47:30.180 --> 47:33.252
<i>"I'll</i> drench you in
the color of my love."

47:33.317 --> 47:36.298
"Your intoxication
gets me high.."

47:36.353 --> 47:37.491
"My heart goes..."

47:39.690 --> 47:41.033
"My heart goes..."

47:43.393 --> 47:44.371
"My heart goes..."

47:46.997 --> 47:48.135
"My heart goes..."

47:50.534 --> 47:51.672
"My heart goes..."

47:54.271 --> 47:55.375
"My heart goes..."

48:04.581 --> 48:07.391
Aunty, brother Daljeet's calling.

48:09.052 --> 48:11.532
How are you?
Fine, mom. How about you?

48:11.588 --> 48:13.124
You sound really happy.

48:13.190 --> 48:14.533
That's Goa, mom.

48:14.591 --> 48:16.002
It's a wonderful place.

48:16.059 --> 48:17.663
Different dawn, different evening..

48:17.728 --> 48:19.674
Different food, different people.

48:19.730 --> 48:21.368
Everything. I'm having fun.

48:21.431 --> 48:23.001
- Who's the girl?
- Sara.

48:23.100 --> 48:23.635
Huh?

48:23.700 --> 48:26.681
Mom, don't you have
anything better to do?

48:26.970 --> 48:29.541
I'm here to work,
not to stare at girls.

48:29.606 --> 48:31.085
I'm your mom.

48:31.141 --> 48:33.417
You're away from my sights,
but not my thoughts.

48:33.477 --> 48:34.649
Amazing, mom.

48:34.711 --> 48:36.452
I can never hide
anything from you.

48:43.420 --> 48:45.400
Nor does she hide anything.

48:49.259 --> 48:52.035
Listen... send me
a picture immediately.

48:52.095 --> 48:55.406
My picture.
The girl. I mean you two together.

48:55.465 --> 48:56.500
Yes, I will.

49:11.481 --> 49:13.085
"My heart goes..."

49:15.118 --> 49:16.426
"My heart goes..."

49:18.956 --> 49:20.299
"My heart goes..."

49:22.392 --> 49:23.962
"My heart goes..."

49:25.996 --> 49:27.407
"My heart goes..."

49:29.566 --> 49:31.273
"My heart goes..."

49:54.024 --> 49:55.002
Oh!

49:59.096 --> 50:00.734
The food and music here is nice.

50:00.998 --> 50:01.635
Tell her.

50:01.698 --> 50:04.008
This place has superb food and music.

50:04.034 --> 50:07.140
Stop, stop... where are you going?
Let go.

50:07.204 --> 50:09.480
Let's have fun,
let's eat and drink.

50:09.539 --> 50:11.018
Stop.

50:11.041 --> 50:12.042
Let me go.

50:12.142 --> 50:14.144
It's a moonlit night.
I'll call the police.

50:14.211 --> 50:16.191
Leave me.

50:17.681 --> 50:20.355
Where do you want to go?

50:21.018 --> 50:22.395
Just say yes.

50:22.452 --> 50:26.195
Let's take them along.
Catch her.

50:26.256 --> 50:27.736
You're just standing
here and staring.

50:28.225 --> 50:29.704
What if it was
your sister instead?

50:29.760 --> 50:31.068
Idiot staring...

50:33.263 --> 50:34.367
Do you feel angry?

50:36.033 --> 50:37.706
Vent it out on them instead of me.

50:38.168 --> 50:38.669
What?

50:38.735 --> 50:40.043
What's your name?

50:40.437 --> 50:41.711
- What?
- Name.

50:41.772 --> 50:42.807
Vaidehi Joshi.

50:43.040 --> 50:45.577
Maharashtrian?
Then you must have strong hands.

50:46.676 --> 50:47.450
Let's see...

50:47.511 --> 50:51.084
Come on... we'll have fun.
Drink some...

50:51.148 --> 50:53.219
Come on, we'll have fun.

50:53.283 --> 50:54.318
What?

50:59.289 --> 51:03.203
See... your finger prints
can be seen on his face.

51:03.693 --> 51:06.037
"If your hands are so strong"

51:06.096 --> 51:08.042
then imagine how
strong your legs are.

51:09.266 --> 51:10.438
Get it?

51:11.334 --> 51:12.244
Come on.

51:12.402 --> 51:13.380
Start.

51:14.738 --> 51:16.308
Take that you fatso.

51:16.373 --> 51:19.286
And that... and that...
Sorry... sorry..

51:20.510 --> 51:23.218
- Sorry... sorry..
- Brother..

51:23.346 --> 51:25.587
- Sister...
- Wait.

51:30.320 --> 51:32.800
Girls should know how
to give a fitting reply.

51:36.326 --> 51:38.067
Girl should know how to react.

51:39.563 --> 51:43.238
Girls shouldn't grow their
nails only to paint them.

51:43.667 --> 51:46.079
They should scratch
the face of their attacker.

51:46.169 --> 51:48.479
And then watch how he bleeds.

51:48.538 --> 51:49.744
Like a rat.

51:53.643 --> 51:55.816
Girl shouldn't grow their
nails only to paint them.

51:56.046 --> 51:58.083
If anybody troubles
you scratch their faces..

51:58.148 --> 51:59.718
And see what color comes out.

51:59.783 --> 52:01.592
He'll look like a rat.

52:08.258 --> 52:10.295
Take a photo.

52:15.265 --> 52:16.107
Fish?

52:29.379 --> 52:30.414
You broke it?

52:30.480 --> 52:31.356
Happy?

52:45.295 --> 52:47.571
Raftaar wait. I am also coming.

52:49.699 --> 52:51.701
This is also in English.

52:52.068 --> 52:53.069
Amaging-

53:01.978 --> 53:03.753
I won't drink after this.
I am done.

53:03.980 --> 53:06.187
Uncle, are you blind?

53:26.536 --> 53:27.446
Boss, that's her.

53:52.662 --> 53:54.335
Where's that Sardar?
Where is Sardar?

53:54.397 --> 53:56.434
We're asking. Hey, I'm asking.

53:56.499 --> 53:58.570
Are you playing games?
Playing with me?

53:58.635 --> 54:00.273
Hey smarty,
are you acting too smart?

54:00.337 --> 54:02.681
Hey smarty,
you're getting to fat?

54:02.739 --> 54:05.379
Enough is enough,
stop troubling me..

54:05.442 --> 54:06.512
And tell me where's that Singh.

54:06.576 --> 54:09.352
Or you don't know
what I can do with you.

54:09.412 --> 54:11.551
Enough is enough,
tell me where he is..

54:11.615 --> 54:12.525
Don't do powder of my brain.

54:12.582 --> 54:14.342
Or else you don't
know what I'll do with you.

54:17.120 --> 54:18.030
You Okay?

54:27.230 --> 54:28.766
"Hey double bonus"

54:29.399 --> 54:32.312
he likes making women realize
their strength, doesn't he?

54:32.736 --> 54:34.010
Show me your strength.

54:34.371 --> 54:35.315
Show me.

54:46.516 --> 54:48.325
Boss, at the back.

54:49.352 --> 54:50.763
You?

55:12.509 --> 55:14.147
Are you crazy?

55:47.177 --> 55:50.158
No need to be scared of Raftaar?

55:50.213 --> 55:51.749
She's the real Rambo?

56:11.334 --> 56:12.642
Who?

56:17.374 --> 56:18.250
What?

56:28.251 --> 56:29.321
What is it?

56:34.324 --> 56:35.462
Coming.

56:42.432 --> 56:43.672
"My heart goes..."

56:49.572 --> 56:50.710
"My heart goes..."

57:08.992 --> 57:10.972
Out in the open.
She's got some really bad ideas.

57:26.075 --> 57:27.520
Coconut, for strength.

58:33.610 --> 58:35.988
Come close.

58:37.413 --> 58:38.983
Come. Come.

58:49.158 --> 58:50.262
Stop this nonsense.

58:50.326 --> 58:51.737
Let me sleep in peace.

58:51.995 --> 58:53.099
Don't you want to go out?

58:53.162 --> 58:54.163
We've been waiting for so long.

58:54.230 --> 58:56.369
I'm not in the mood, nor is Sara.

58:56.566 --> 59:00.309
Hey... what's wrong with you?
It's a pulled muscle.

59:01.170 --> 59:02.274
Shut up!

59:02.705 --> 59:06.676
Now I don't need to be scared of you,
Sara's with me. - Imli's got really bold.

59:07.143 --> 59:08.087
Raftaar!

59:08.978 --> 59:09.649
Yes, sir.

59:09.712 --> 59:11.248
Do you know what you did?

59:11.314 --> 59:13.590
You hit Boxer's men.
Are you an idiot?

59:16.586 --> 59:18.065
You know the consequence?

59:19.722 --> 59:20.700
Then why?

59:21.991 --> 59:24.699
Leave it to me...
and never repeat it again!

59:27.463 --> 59:28.168
Go.

59:30.600 --> 59:31.476
Go!

59:42.011 --> 59:45.013
He makes mistakes...
but also admits them quietly.

59:45.014 --> 59:46.015
Nice boy.

59:47.450 --> 59:48.724
I yelled at him for no reason.

59:49.586 --> 59:51.759
- Go explain to him.
- Yes.

59:54.591 --> 59:55.569
Singh.

59:58.461 --> 01:00:01.635
Why did you hit Boxer's
men at the restaurant?

01:00:01.698 --> 01:00:03.143
You don't know him.

01:00:03.199 --> 01:00:06.112
If you hit five of his men,
he'll send another 50.

01:00:06.169 --> 01:00:08.046
The boss means well.

01:00:08.104 --> 01:00:09.174
Control yourself.

01:00:16.546 --> 01:00:19.720
Did I really beat up Boxer's men?

01:00:20.783 --> 01:00:23.127
I was drunk, don't remember.

01:00:23.786 --> 01:00:24.662
Let's go.

01:00:43.573 --> 01:00:45.177
Someone's knocking on the door.

01:00:45.341 --> 01:00:46.342
It's nothing.

01:00:48.077 --> 01:00:52.082
Hey.. - It's nothing,
go back to sleep.

01:00:57.420 --> 01:00:58.694
Heard that.

01:00:58.755 --> 01:01:00.632
Don't listen, go back to sleep.

01:01:00.690 --> 01:01:03.466
Someone might need something and
all you can think about is sleeping.

01:01:04.627 --> 01:01:07.335
- I'll take a look.
- Don't go.

01:01:07.597 --> 01:01:09.201
Stop, Pompi.

01:01:11.034 --> 01:01:12.570
You? What is it?

01:01:13.036 --> 01:01:15.038
Take my advice,
go back to sleep.

01:01:23.613 --> 01:01:24.683
What?

01:01:24.747 --> 01:01:27.489
Its nothing, go to sleep.

01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:29.027
Jealous, aren't you?

01:01:29.052 --> 01:01:31.396
Now I know why you weren't
letting me open the door.

01:01:31.454 --> 01:01:34.333
- Friend... no.
- Yes!

01:01:34.691 --> 01:01:37.035
You're not a friend... betrayer.

01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:39.040
"My heart goes..." - Pompy.

01:01:44.233 --> 01:01:45.337
"My heart goes..."

01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:49.047
"My heart goes..."

01:02:16.232 --> 01:02:18.178
I also like cream
in my coconut water.

01:02:35.051 --> 01:02:36.655
Pompy, did you get cramps too?

01:02:38.654 --> 01:02:41.794
Idiot, couldn't you warn me.
I did.

01:02:42.058 --> 01:02:43.765
I said "Go to sleep"...

01:02:44.026 --> 01:02:46.370
Couldn't you just tell me?

01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:48.272
You left before I could.

01:02:48.331 --> 01:02:49.366
Come in.

01:02:49.565 --> 01:02:51.044
Friend.

01:02:52.401 --> 01:02:53.175
Come.

01:02:54.804 --> 01:02:56.408
Slowly... careful.

01:02:58.541 --> 01:03:00.543
After getting married
you feel ashamed.

01:03:03.212 --> 01:03:05.522
Take this...
and get ready for the dance.

01:03:05.581 --> 01:03:09.290
Otherwise... I will finish
the family you started.

01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:15.034
How are you, sweetheart.

01:03:16.125 --> 01:03:18.162
All the girls are taking a chance.

01:03:18.227 --> 01:03:19.706
What did I just say?

01:03:20.763 --> 01:03:22.208
Where were you yesterday?

01:03:22.265 --> 01:03:23.266
I did a complete background check..

01:03:23.332 --> 01:03:25.692
On the girl from Romania
who's staying at Kirpal's place.

01:03:26.035 --> 01:03:28.106
Why are you following
girls instead of doing my job?

01:03:28.171 --> 01:03:31.118
That girl beat me up yesterday,
I cannot let her go.

01:03:34.143 --> 01:03:36.350
But you said you
slipped in the bathroom.

01:03:36.746 --> 01:03:38.521
You got beaten up by a girl?

01:03:41.417 --> 01:03:43.727
Borrow that dancer's
clothes and dance.

01:03:43.786 --> 01:03:45.595
Get that Romanian girl.

01:04:13.449 --> 01:04:14.587
We went to the first
place looking for that woman..

01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:15.458
But couldn't find her.

01:04:15.518 --> 01:04:18.124
Then the second,
then that third, then the fourth...

01:04:18.254 --> 01:04:19.995
We searched all over Goa.

01:04:20.022 --> 01:04:22.002
What's the big deal
if we couldn't find her?

01:04:22.225 --> 01:04:24.262
I haven't eaten
anything since morning.

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:27.038
What if she was your mother?

01:04:28.297 --> 01:04:30.299
- She's her mother?
- Yes!

01:04:30.366 --> 01:04:32.175
We came to Goa looking for her.

01:04:39.775 --> 01:04:41.254
Let's go.

01:04:45.381 --> 01:04:47.292
Stop. Stop.

01:04:52.488 --> 01:04:53.466
Come out.

01:04:54.724 --> 01:04:56.362
So you hit my men at the shack.

01:04:56.425 --> 01:04:58.029
My boss wants to meet you.

01:04:58.060 --> 01:04:59.801
Hey... come here.

01:05:00.429 --> 01:05:01.373
Come here.

01:05:02.465 --> 01:05:05.446
She can't talk to anyone
without my permission.

01:05:05.501 --> 01:05:07.447
She's under my control.

01:05:08.104 --> 01:05:11.017
And she can't go anywhere
until I don't allow her.

01:05:11.307 --> 01:05:12.285
Sara...

01:05:14.110 --> 01:05:15.020
Sara!

01:05:15.177 --> 01:05:16.554
Sara, don't go with them.

01:05:16.612 --> 01:05:19.422
I beat up their men,
now they will beat us.

01:05:19.482 --> 01:05:20.460
Explain her.

01:05:20.516 --> 01:05:21.221
Imli!

01:05:21.284 --> 01:05:23.389
I just forgot something at home.
I'll go get it.

01:05:23.452 --> 01:05:25.659
Imli, who is going to explain
those two? Come with me. -Let me go.

01:05:25.721 --> 01:05:27.428
- No No.
- Come with me.

01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:30.369
Let me go.
Imli, don't move so much.

01:05:30.426 --> 01:05:32.997
I don't know Hindi.
Stop moving.

01:05:36.332 --> 01:05:38.107
Let me go.

01:05:55.751 --> 01:05:59.597
Forgive me,
I got you two into this.

01:06:00.623 --> 01:06:03.229
No, it wasn't you..

01:06:03.292 --> 01:06:05.363
Hey...enough!

01:06:06.062 --> 01:06:07.006
Come here.

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:13.573
This is between me
and that girl.

01:06:15.504 --> 01:06:16.710
You stay out.

01:06:21.243 --> 01:06:23.416
I never completed any job till date.

01:06:24.747 --> 01:06:26.749
But I won't quit this one.

01:06:27.416 --> 01:06:31.023
If you have the guts,
then try to get to the girl?

01:06:38.461 --> 01:06:40.168
Move the table, come on.

01:06:47.436 --> 01:06:49.780
You fell down even before
we started, very good.

01:06:52.141 --> 01:06:53.347
All of you stay back.

01:06:54.043 --> 01:06:56.148
If you can survive until
this cigarette burns you..

01:06:57.046 --> 01:06:58.286
Then you win.

01:07:12.094 --> 01:07:13.539
What's this chorus?

01:07:45.161 --> 01:07:48.540
Boss, should I light
another cigarette?

01:07:52.001 --> 01:07:53.241
Beat him!

01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:58.416
If anyone wanders near that girl,
I will kill him.

01:08:10.286 --> 01:08:11.196
Sara, don't be scared.

01:08:11.253 --> 01:08:12.994
Just stay behind me.

01:08:13.289 --> 01:08:15.166
I'll deal with these idiots.

01:08:47.656 --> 01:08:51.229
Last warning... don't make me mad!

01:08:56.999 --> 01:08:58.706
Sara... run.

01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:25.061
Sara! Sara! Sara! Sara! Sara!

01:10:25.554 --> 01:10:29.058
Raftaar... your speech
worked like a miracle.

01:10:29.525 --> 01:10:31.766
Last evening... it gave
courage to those two girls.

01:10:32.194 --> 01:10:34.231
And now she's turned
into queen Laxmibai.

01:10:34.697 --> 01:10:36.370
You're simply amazing.

01:10:37.066 --> 01:10:38.511
- She's here.
- Come on.

01:10:39.034 --> 01:10:40.240
Hello, sister.

01:10:56.719 --> 01:10:57.754
You Okay?

01:11:06.662 --> 01:11:08.266
Brave man.

01:11:13.135 --> 01:11:14.478
"I am a Singh."

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:16.742
"Bravo Singh.."

01:11:17.006 --> 01:11:18.349
"I am a Singh."

01:11:20.242 --> 01:11:21.585
"I am a Singh."

01:11:33.525 --> 01:11:35.061
Is it hurting pretty bad?

01:11:36.128 --> 01:11:38.506
Doesn't hurt that bad,
stop pretending.

01:11:39.298 --> 01:11:40.641
That's what she said.

01:11:41.433 --> 01:11:44.141
I really appreciate all the
trouble you're going through for me.

01:11:44.269 --> 01:11:47.307
If you can't defend yourself in
trouble, then this is bound to happen.

01:11:55.547 --> 01:11:56.457
Take care.

01:11:59.685 --> 01:12:03.633
Be careful next time. We
cannot keep saving you all the time.

01:12:03.689 --> 01:12:05.225
You should know that.

01:12:08.527 --> 01:12:10.734
"That girl only said two words"

01:12:10.996 --> 01:12:12.669
"whereas your
explanation was lengthier."

01:12:12.731 --> 01:12:15.678
Try to understand the
depth of the situation.

01:12:21.006 --> 01:12:22.246
What's this?

01:12:26.111 --> 01:12:27.351
Its Imli's stuff.

01:12:27.412 --> 01:12:28.356
Where is she?

01:12:34.653 --> 01:12:36.929
Hey... did you throw our stuff out?

01:12:36.955 --> 01:12:39.196
From today that's my room.

01:12:39.257 --> 01:12:40.235
Why?

01:12:40.425 --> 01:12:42.598
- Sara!
- Of course. Of course.

01:12:45.397 --> 01:12:46.569
Help!

01:12:50.268 --> 01:12:52.179
Stand up.

01:12:56.641 --> 01:12:57.483
Come on.

01:13:00.045 --> 01:13:03.652
I suggest that you retire now.

01:13:04.149 --> 01:13:06.151
Shift to Canada...
buy some mall or something..

01:13:07.085 --> 01:13:07.995
Sorry.

01:13:08.086 --> 01:13:08.996
Out!

01:13:18.096 --> 01:13:20.975
Raftaar, I know you did this.

01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:23.946
No, I...
But it was the right thing to do.

01:13:25.137 --> 01:13:25.945
Come forward!

01:13:27.139 --> 01:13:28.413
- Come forward!
- Yes.

01:13:30.242 --> 01:13:31.687
Raftaar.

01:13:33.912 --> 01:13:35.323
Raftaar.

01:13:37.382 --> 01:13:38.952
Raftaar.

01:13:41.053 --> 01:13:42.532
Raftaar.

01:13:46.224 --> 01:13:47.259
Further.

01:13:54.332 --> 01:13:56.642
From today you're my right-hand.

01:13:57.636 --> 01:13:59.036
If he's your right-hand, what am I?

01:13:59.071 --> 01:14:00.675
Last. Any problem?

01:14:01.373 --> 01:14:03.444
No problem,
I just wanted to confirm.

01:14:03.708 --> 01:14:05.984
I should know what my position is.

01:14:09.581 --> 01:14:11.117
Raftaar.

01:14:13.285 --> 01:14:14.662
Raftaar.

01:14:16.721 --> 01:14:17.392
Sir.

01:14:21.359 --> 01:14:23.430
Should I book a ticket
for you to Canada?

01:14:23.562 --> 01:14:24.939
Its holiday season.

01:14:25.163 --> 01:14:27.040
Tickets are hard to get.

01:14:38.243 --> 01:14:39.654
Tilt down, sir.

01:14:43.615 --> 01:14:45.094
Hurry up already.

01:14:54.292 --> 01:14:55.202
Hello.

01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:59.030
I can tell you the whereabouts
of the girl you're looking for.

01:15:07.105 --> 01:15:08.379
George!

01:15:08.707 --> 01:15:10.186
Sara is in Goa.

01:15:10.375 --> 01:15:11.217
Finish her,

01:15:19.651 --> 01:15:22.097
I cannot sleep in the new room.

01:15:24.556 --> 01:15:25.591
Imli.

01:15:26.124 --> 01:15:27.501
Coconut.

01:15:27.559 --> 01:15:30.005
- We'll get cramps again.
- Run.

01:15:30.362 --> 01:15:34.333
"I strode through your lanes.."

01:15:41.273 --> 01:15:42.946
Sorry, sorry... it was a mistake.

01:15:43.108 --> 01:15:44.519
Did you find my mother?

01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:47.090
It wasn't intentional, I swear.

01:15:47.445 --> 01:15:50.358
You don't have to swear,
I trust you.

01:15:58.089 --> 01:16:00.194
Buttermilk. Drink.

01:16:26.551 --> 01:16:28.997
I can't believe she's
drunk with buttermilk.

01:17:17.435 --> 01:17:21.178
"All I want is you baby,
so come and give your love to me."

01:17:21.239 --> 01:17:23.014
"This moment feels alright."

01:17:23.141 --> 01:17:24.347
"Tonight's the night."

01:17:24.409 --> 01:17:28.152
"All I want is you baby,
so come and give your love to me."

01:17:28.213 --> 01:17:29.920
"This moment feels alright."

01:17:30.115 --> 01:17:31.219
"Tonight's the night."

01:17:31.316 --> 01:17:35.162
"Come sweetheart and..."

01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:36.927
"This moment feels alright."

01:17:37.255 --> 01:17:38.325
"Tonight's the night."

01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:45.137
"Come sweetheart and...
let me take you in my arms."

01:17:45.330 --> 01:17:52.145
"Come sweetheart and...
let me take you in my arms."

01:17:52.203 --> 01:17:59.178
"Come sweetheart and...
let me take you in my arms."

01:17:59.244 --> 01:18:06.128
"Come sweetheart and...
let me take you in my arms."

01:18:06.184 --> 01:18:09.961
"All I want is you baby,
so come and give your love to me."

01:18:10.021 --> 01:18:11.955
"This moment feels alright."

01:18:11.956 --> 01:18:13.458
"Tonight's the night."

01:18:13.525 --> 01:18:17.132
"All I want is you baby,
so come and give your love to me."

01:18:17.195 --> 01:18:18.970
"This moment feels alright."

01:18:19.164 --> 01:18:20.472
"Tonight's the night."

01:18:20.532 --> 01:18:23.638
"You're my life,
you're my destiny."

01:18:23.902 --> 01:18:27.213
"I am your Romeo,
and you're my Juliet."

01:18:27.272 --> 01:18:30.617
"How do I convey my love for you?"

01:18:30.875 --> 01:18:34.084
"All I can say is I see God in you."

01:18:34.145 --> 01:18:41.085
"Come sweetheart and...
let me take you in my arms."

01:18:41.186 --> 01:18:48.195
"Come sweetheart and...
let me take you in my arms."

01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:50.471
"Feels alright."

01:18:50.528 --> 01:18:52.166
"Tonight's the night."

01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:58.609
"You're the bond that
controls my soaring heart."

01:18:58.670 --> 01:19:02.083
"No one's gonna love
you as much as I do."

01:19:02.140 --> 01:19:05.678
"You're more gorgeous than Juliet,
more precious than diamonds."

01:19:05.944 --> 01:19:09.016
"Those crazy
in love desire only you."

01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:16.020
"Come sweetheart and...
let me take you in my arms."

01:19:16.087 --> 01:19:22.971
"Come sweetheart and...
let me take you in my arms."

01:19:23.027 --> 01:19:30.309
"Come sweetheart and...
let me take you in my arms."

01:19:50.121 --> 01:19:53.102
If you want to marry her,
you must learn English.

01:19:53.158 --> 01:19:54.228
In 30 days.

01:19:54.292 --> 01:19:55.532
English in 30 days.

01:19:55.927 --> 01:19:58.567
One tight slap and you'll
learn your lesson in 30 seconds.

01:19:58.630 --> 01:20:00.667
You want me to learn
English at this age?

01:20:01.099 --> 01:20:03.136
What do you want me to be,
the Prime Minister?

01:20:03.201 --> 01:20:04.202
But..

01:20:05.170 --> 01:20:06.478
Stupid idea.

01:20:06.538 --> 01:20:08.415
Hey... it was your idea.

01:20:08.573 --> 01:20:10.484
They sent it so soon?

01:20:13.945 --> 01:20:15.253
My mind's all heated up.

01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:16.954
Let's cool it down.

01:20:50.482 --> 01:20:51.552
Pompy!

01:20:53.184 --> 01:20:54.322
Pompy!

01:20:59.991 --> 01:21:00.992
I see.

01:21:01.259 --> 01:21:03.170
'Learn English in 3 days.'

01:21:03.228 --> 01:21:05.105
'Are they on to my game?'

01:21:11.436 --> 01:21:13.040
I may look like a innocent dove...

01:21:13.104 --> 01:21:15.084
but I am really smart.

01:22:13.331 --> 01:22:15.311
Did you get those
Hindi-to-English books?

01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:17.676
Not me, it was Pappi's idea.
I see.

01:22:21.539 --> 01:22:23.109
You made a match for everyone.

01:22:23.174 --> 01:22:25.245
How about some miracle
in my life as well?

01:22:35.119 --> 01:22:36.462
What exploded?

01:22:37.522 --> 01:22:38.967
Who exploded?

01:22:41.693 --> 01:22:44.299
I asked for a miracle,
not black magic.

01:22:45.630 --> 01:22:46.404
Who is she?

01:22:47.432 --> 01:22:48.308
<i>Shoot!</i>

01:22:54.138 --> 01:22:55.481
Sara, come.

01:23:06.417 --> 01:23:07.987
We are dead.

01:23:16.127 --> 01:23:17.663
Move away.

01:23:30.541 --> 01:23:31.576
Drive fast.

01:23:31.943 --> 01:23:33.650
If I drive slow, we'll die.

01:23:33.911 --> 01:23:34.946
Stupid girl.

01:23:39.550 --> 01:23:41.120
Move. Move here.

01:23:41.653 --> 01:23:43.189
- What?
- Switch.

01:23:44.555 --> 01:23:45.465
Here.

01:23:50.161 --> 01:23:51.333
Move.

01:23:51.963 --> 01:23:52.941
Let me try.

01:23:52.964 --> 01:23:54.068
What are you doing?

01:25:23.421 --> 01:25:24.331
What?

01:25:26.524 --> 01:25:27.559
Move!

01:25:30.228 --> 01:25:31.468
What are you doing?

01:25:31.529 --> 01:25:32.530
Stop.

01:25:33.264 --> 01:25:34.299
My car.

01:25:50.181 --> 01:25:51.125
Go.

01:25:57.955 --> 01:25:58.933
Sara.

01:25:58.956 --> 01:26:00.264
Sara, give me your hand.

01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:10.577
Turn around.

01:27:23.207 --> 01:27:26.450
I am a Singh, I never hit girls.

01:27:52.637 --> 01:27:55.675
And she's a Kaur,
she hits everyone.

01:27:59.277 --> 01:28:00.415
"I am a Singh."

01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:03.920
"I am a Singh."

01:28:11.689 --> 01:28:13.168
Sir, that Boxer will never change.

01:28:13.224 --> 01:28:15.568
He sent his men home to kill us.

01:28:18.262 --> 01:28:21.436
I'll handle things here,
take her someplace safe.

01:28:21.499 --> 01:28:22.876
Sir, can I take her to Punjab.

01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:24.902
- She'll be safe there.
- Yeah.

01:28:25.369 --> 01:28:26.541
It's not safe here.

01:28:27.004 --> 01:28:29.541
Till things get sorted out,
please lie low.

01:28:33.978 --> 01:28:34.922
Take her.

01:28:39.417 --> 01:28:40.555
Kirpal.

01:28:42.019 --> 01:28:43.225
Yeah, Kirpal.

01:28:48.459 --> 01:28:50.598
I want to meet Mark, ASAP!

01:29:04.342 --> 01:29:06.049
Brother's back.

01:29:06.444 --> 01:29:08.424
Brother Raftaar's back!

01:29:08.479 --> 01:29:10.652
Brother Raftaar's back!

01:29:11.515 --> 01:29:15.429
Brother, the village
felt lonely without you.

01:29:22.593 --> 01:29:23.469
Raftaar!

01:29:24.528 --> 01:29:25.632
Raftaar!

01:29:36.073 --> 01:29:39.020
Surprising... Raftaar's brought
such a fair lass with her.

01:29:40.511 --> 01:29:42.548
She's for real.

01:29:43.114 --> 01:29:45.560
She's looking at me.
No, she's looking at me.

01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:48.894
Move aside.

01:29:49.387 --> 01:29:50.331
She's a guest.

01:29:50.388 --> 01:29:51.924
I know she's a guest.

01:29:51.989 --> 01:29:54.060
Not the kind of guest you think.

01:29:54.125 --> 01:29:55.001
No, no...

01:29:55.059 --> 01:29:57.005
You had stopped making sweets.

01:29:57.061 --> 01:29:59.063
My heart's saying we'll
be getting good news today.

01:29:59.130 --> 01:29:59.904
I see...

01:30:00.231 --> 01:30:02.268
See... it's already here.

01:30:05.336 --> 01:30:08.340
Excuse me... I've got 10 tractors.
What say?

01:30:08.406 --> 01:30:12.513
You fool, she's got ten shoes.
Now get back.

01:30:32.963 --> 01:30:34.135
Where did they go?

01:30:36.901 --> 01:30:38.073
Greetings, father.

01:30:40.871 --> 01:30:42.111
Why do you have that grin?

01:30:42.173 --> 01:30:44.881
I missed watching
Raftaar getting scolded.

01:30:44.909 --> 01:30:45.887
This is going to be fun.

01:30:45.910 --> 01:30:48.584
Didn't we gather around
to divide our property?

01:30:48.646 --> 01:30:50.125
It's about time.

01:30:50.181 --> 01:30:51.421
Oh brother...

01:31:04.662 --> 01:31:05.538
Sara.

01:31:13.070 --> 01:31:14.071
Son.

01:31:16.207 --> 01:31:17.049
Father.

01:31:21.612 --> 01:31:23.523
Kuldeep called.

01:31:23.914 --> 01:31:26.690
This girl is our guest,
take good care of her.

01:31:27.151 --> 01:31:29.188
Mom, come quickly.

01:31:30.488 --> 01:31:32.661
Sara... mom.

01:31:34.492 --> 01:31:36.028
Mom... Sara.

01:31:38.696 --> 01:31:39.970
Guest.

01:31:41.932 --> 01:31:44.606
Honestly, she's a guest. Yeah.

01:31:46.470 --> 01:31:47.380
Come.

01:31:49.373 --> 01:31:50.579
Come.

01:31:53.444 --> 01:31:57.950
I am Manpreet. And I'm Preeto.

01:31:58.349 --> 01:31:59.953
And that's my daughter Babli.
Hello.

01:31:59.984 --> 01:32:01.725
And this is my daughter Shikha.
Hello.

01:32:01.952 --> 01:32:03.329
Shake hands.

01:32:04.288 --> 01:32:06.097
Come on everyone, sit down.

01:32:06.690 --> 01:32:08.670
I know she's a guest,
but isn't this a bit too much.

01:32:08.726 --> 01:32:11.366
This is her first visit
home after the wedding.

01:32:11.428 --> 01:32:12.498
She's bound to be treated well.

01:32:12.563 --> 01:32:13.541
Wedding?

01:32:13.597 --> 01:32:15.736
She's Raftaar's wife, isn't she?

01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:19.071
What are you doing?
Take some sweet porridge in it.

01:32:19.136 --> 01:32:21.173
Raftaar's bride... huh!

01:32:25.209 --> 01:32:27.450
Oh my... take some water.

01:32:27.511 --> 01:32:29.013
Drink it.

01:32:29.313 --> 01:32:30.917
Drink the water.

01:32:36.020 --> 01:32:37.363
Slowly.

01:32:41.058 --> 01:32:42.935
Everything's fine. Now eat.

01:32:44.161 --> 01:32:45.231
Sit down.

01:33:15.726 --> 01:33:18.366
- So sweet.
- There's the sweet.

01:33:19.964 --> 01:33:22.604
Goodnight, sister-in-law. Sara.

01:33:22.666 --> 01:33:24.543
Yes, sister-in-law.

01:33:26.237 --> 01:33:28.308
Okay, sister-in-law.

01:33:28.372 --> 01:33:30.648
Goodnight, sister-in-law.
Goodnight.

01:33:45.055 --> 01:33:46.932
Naughty boy.

01:33:48.025 --> 01:33:51.973
No matter where you go,
you're always up to your tricks.

01:33:52.296 --> 01:33:57.939
You didn't send her picture.. But
did you tell her about your feelings?

01:33:57.968 --> 01:33:59.675
Mom, I tried,
but couldn't get a chance.

01:33:59.937 --> 01:34:01.939
- Your father is right.
- What?

01:34:01.972 --> 01:34:04.282
You never complete anything.

01:34:04.341 --> 01:34:07.345
Mom, don't start that.
Start what...

01:34:07.478 --> 01:34:09.685
- Mom, no..
- Naughty...

01:34:12.516 --> 01:34:14.462
You brought her home inside.

01:34:14.518 --> 01:34:15.724
Naughty boy.

01:34:21.592 --> 01:34:23.663
No, no... stop... stop.

01:34:30.234 --> 01:34:32.180
Now sleep.

01:34:56.427 --> 01:34:58.964
'My Sweety is here.'
'My Sweety is here.'

01:35:33.063 --> 01:35:34.508
You cured my pain instantly.

01:35:34.932 --> 01:35:35.672
Come, sit.

01:35:38.135 --> 01:35:39.205
Sit, sit.

01:35:41.905 --> 01:35:44.146
So tell me...
are you really a guest.

01:35:44.208 --> 01:35:46.409
Or is there something
cooking between you and my son?

01:35:47.411 --> 01:35:50.915
Sorry, I don't understand.

01:35:51.148 --> 01:35:52.923
How do I explain her?

01:36:03.260 --> 01:36:04.398
Okay.

01:36:09.666 --> 01:36:10.644
Raftaar.

01:36:11.034 --> 01:36:11.944
Huh?

01:36:18.675 --> 01:36:19.653
Me.

01:36:39.630 --> 01:36:43.544
Our relationship has no future.

01:36:44.234 --> 01:36:46.111
I...I don't know.

01:36:50.441 --> 01:36:51.647
Raftaar..

01:36:55.946 --> 01:36:57.186
Thinking.

01:37:06.657 --> 01:37:09.228
My son is very nice.

01:37:09.660 --> 01:37:12.334
"Even if I scold him in
front of the entire village"

01:37:12.963 --> 01:37:14.965
he never back answers.

01:37:15.566 --> 01:37:18.479
He isn't scared of me,
just respects me.

01:37:19.470 --> 01:37:21.950
He loves his mother.

01:37:22.606 --> 01:37:27.385
And a son that loves his mother...
has a beautiful heart.

01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:31.585
You don't understand, do you?

01:37:31.648 --> 01:37:33.252
You will one day.

01:37:33.317 --> 01:37:34.523
Grandfather.

01:37:35.118 --> 01:37:37.098
- Did you heat the water?
- Yes.

01:37:37.154 --> 01:37:38.565
But let her bathe first.

01:37:38.622 --> 01:37:42.593
Sara, go take a bath
and then wear this.

01:37:46.129 --> 01:37:46.937
Okay.

01:37:47.364 --> 01:37:48.434
Thank you.

01:37:50.434 --> 01:37:51.572
Finish drinking your water.

01:38:05.682 --> 01:38:07.491
Come, brother.

01:38:08.285 --> 01:38:10.060
You can drive
that when you grow up.

01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:10.962
Go.

01:38:11.421 --> 01:38:13.958
Where are you going?

01:38:14.958 --> 01:38:16.335
Did you come here
to wander alone..

01:38:16.393 --> 01:38:17.929
Or take Sara around.

01:38:18.061 --> 01:38:19.301
Take her along.

01:38:20.497 --> 01:38:21.976
Babli, come here.

01:38:22.132 --> 01:38:23.270
Quickly..

01:38:23.333 --> 01:38:26.007
Look, you need to...

01:38:28.372 --> 01:38:29.812
You don't need to
take sister around.

01:38:29.873 --> 01:38:31.181
Because I will take
her sight-seeing.

01:38:31.241 --> 01:38:32.549
You just concentrate
on your studies.

01:38:32.609 --> 01:38:33.644
Go and study.

01:38:46.557 --> 01:38:47.934
Naughty boy.

01:38:57.467 --> 01:39:02.467
"Sweetheart,
your beauty's like the rainbow."

01:39:10.314 --> 01:39:15.314
"Even the moon... looks useless
when compared to you."

01:39:36.340 --> 01:39:37.876
"Come, honey."

01:39:37.908 --> 01:39:39.615
"Let's watch a film, honey."

01:39:39.876 --> 01:39:41.651
"From 9 to 12, honey."

01:39:52.022 --> 01:39:53.330
"Come, honey."

01:39:53.390 --> 01:39:55.267
"Let's watch a film, honey."

01:39:55.425 --> 01:39:57.302
"From 9 to 12, honey."

01:40:00.330 --> 01:40:01.934
"When it'll be dark night."

01:40:02.032 --> 01:40:03.943
"My heart... will beat gallantly."

01:40:04.067 --> 01:40:05.910
<i>"I'll</i> hold you in my arms tight."

01:40:05.936 --> 01:40:07.916
"O beloved, what did you do?"

01:40:07.938 --> 01:40:11.476
"Come in my arms,
let me kiss you."

01:40:11.541 --> 01:40:12.918
"Come, honey."

01:40:13.176 --> 01:40:15.019
"Let's watch a film, honey."

01:40:15.078 --> 01:40:16.921
"From 9 to 12, honey."

01:40:46.643 --> 01:40:50.386
"I want to climb the
mountain and yell out loud..."

01:40:50.447 --> 01:40:54.224
"...I want to make you
a Punjabi daughter-in-law."

01:40:54.384 --> 01:40:58.230
"Sweetheart, let me take
you across the seven seas."

01:40:58.288 --> 01:41:01.929
"After which we'll
land in my village."

01:41:02.159 --> 01:41:06.301
"My father will shed tears,
and my mom will dance."

01:41:06.396 --> 01:41:08.034
"Come, honey."

01:41:09.499 --> 01:41:11.376
"Let's watch a film, honey."

01:41:14.037 --> 01:41:15.311
"Come, honey."

01:41:15.372 --> 01:41:17.409
"Let's watch a film, honey."

01:41:17.474 --> 01:41:19.283
"From 9 to 12, honey."

01:41:47.504 --> 01:41:51.350
"My heart doesn't
beat fast or slow."

01:41:51.408 --> 01:41:54.981
"Every time I look at you,
it yells hip-hip-hurray."

01:41:55.045 --> 01:41:58.618
"Let's stick together like magnet."

01:41:58.949 --> 01:42:02.624
"Let's hold each other
tight until our desires awaken."

01:42:02.686 --> 01:42:06.964
"It's not difficult
to do the Punjabi Bhangra."

01:42:06.990 --> 01:42:08.196
"Come, honey."

01:42:08.258 --> 01:42:10.101
"Let's watch a film, honey."

01:42:10.227 --> 01:42:12.104
"From 9 to 12, honey."

01:42:26.409 --> 01:42:29.686
Raftaar sir,
we've found Sara's mom.

01:42:29.913 --> 01:42:31.085
She's right here in Goa.

01:42:31.148 --> 01:42:32.957
Bring Sara back immediately.

01:42:33.016 --> 01:42:34.154
Okay. Fine, fine...

01:42:34.217 --> 01:42:35.093
Okay.

01:42:35.919 --> 01:42:36.522
Sara!

01:42:37.420 --> 01:42:38.160
Sara!

01:42:41.358 --> 01:42:44.066
Sara... mom...

01:42:45.695 --> 01:42:46.935
Goa!

01:42:52.536 --> 01:42:54.038
You found her.

01:43:05.448 --> 01:43:06.483
Thank you.

01:44:06.977 --> 01:44:09.116
Sara, is that you?

01:44:38.942 --> 01:44:41.115
- Caught you.
- Mom.

01:44:41.945 --> 01:44:44.687
I caught my cat.

01:44:45.315 --> 01:44:48.956
What did you do at school?
I studied.

01:44:49.052 --> 01:44:50.292
Didn't you do any mischief?

01:44:50.353 --> 01:44:54.597
I did a lot of mischief.
I see. How?

01:44:54.658 --> 01:44:57.036
Like this. Like this.

01:44:57.093 --> 01:45:00.336
Hug me...
the Sara hug... tight hug.

01:45:00.563 --> 01:45:04.204
Mom, someone's here
to buy a plant. - I see.

01:45:50.947 --> 01:45:52.324
Thanks for everything.

01:45:53.450 --> 01:45:55.225
She's thanking you.

01:45:56.920 --> 01:45:58.957
When will you be back?

01:45:59.956 --> 01:46:01.026
Never.

01:46:17.207 --> 01:46:19.414
She's leaving, say it.

01:46:20.310 --> 01:46:21.516
Say it.

01:46:24.547 --> 01:46:25.890
Go on.

01:46:28.084 --> 01:46:28.994
Wait, sir.

01:46:29.052 --> 01:46:30.053
- Wait.
- Sara.

01:46:32.088 --> 01:46:34.090
Sir, please wait. Passport.
One minute.

01:46:34.157 --> 01:46:38.469
Sara, I want to tell you something.

01:46:38.528 --> 01:46:40.906
Sara, he just wants to say that.

01:46:41.931 --> 01:46:43.274
You explained her a lot.

01:46:43.466 --> 01:46:44.376
Not now...

01:46:45.402 --> 01:46:46.608
let me.

01:46:49.239 --> 01:46:52.277
Sara, I don't know why you
suddenly had a change of heart..

01:46:52.409 --> 01:46:53.911
And why you're leaving.

01:46:54.577 --> 01:47:00.050
But the way I feel about you, I swear
I never felt like this for anyone.

01:47:00.283 --> 01:47:01.284
Sir, please stay back.

01:47:01.351 --> 01:47:02.386
Let others pass through.

01:47:02.452 --> 01:47:03.658
There's a long queue.

01:47:04.521 --> 01:47:05.659
Move back.

01:47:06.523 --> 01:47:07.501
One minute,

01:47:07.957 --> 01:47:09.061
Sara...

01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:12.166
Sir, please...

01:47:12.395 --> 01:47:14.102
Please... ma'am please come.

01:47:16.599 --> 01:47:18.101
Sir please.

01:47:28.445 --> 01:47:31.085
Why was she so upset
after meeting her mother?

01:47:45.195 --> 01:47:46.173
Sara.

01:47:47.897 --> 01:47:49.001
Hi.

01:47:51.434 --> 01:47:52.412
Mark.

01:47:54.204 --> 01:47:56.241
You can do business
in any way you want.

01:47:56.306 --> 01:47:58.445
I am prepared
to give you anything.

01:47:58.575 --> 01:48:00.248
But not Sara.

01:48:01.911 --> 01:48:03.948
I can't tolerate insult.

01:48:04.013 --> 01:48:06.960
I didn't spare my own father
how can I spare your daughter?

01:48:07.617 --> 01:48:09.460
But I will spare Sara now.

01:48:09.519 --> 01:48:12.432
You spare her for me...
get us married.

01:48:12.555 --> 01:48:13.556
Mark!

01:48:13.623 --> 01:48:16.194
Don't even dare!

01:48:22.966 --> 01:48:26.106
You have 48 hours to
say 'yes' for our marriage.

01:48:28.071 --> 01:48:30.574
I'm letting you live so that
you can explain your daughter.

01:48:57.333 --> 01:48:59.210
How are you?

01:49:16.386 --> 01:49:19.924
Ma'am.
Somebody's here to meet you.

01:49:40.577 --> 01:49:42.284
Sara!

01:49:50.186 --> 01:49:51.130
Mom.

01:49:52.222 --> 01:49:53.326
Sara.

01:49:54.157 --> 01:49:56.433
My baby...

01:49:59.896 --> 01:50:01.933
My sweety...

01:50:02.532 --> 01:50:05.274
I love you I missed you so much.

01:50:07.403 --> 01:50:08.575
Mom!

01:50:14.210 --> 01:50:15.951
I've missed you mom.

01:50:16.012 --> 01:50:17.923
I missed you baby.

01:50:25.788 --> 01:50:27.199
I am sorry.

01:50:27.523 --> 01:50:29.560
I was unfair to you.

01:50:30.126 --> 01:50:34.268
My work drove me away
from you and our daughter.

01:50:34.897 --> 01:50:37.173
I was still had the
wrong opinion about you..

01:50:37.400 --> 01:50:39.539
That you got married again.

01:50:40.470 --> 01:50:44.543
No, to forget my pain
of separating from Sara..

01:50:45.174 --> 01:50:47.620
I associated myself
with a orphanage.

01:50:48.011 --> 01:50:49.285
But now I am so happy.

01:50:49.512 --> 01:50:51.355
Now we're all together again.

01:51:01.424 --> 01:51:02.368
Hello.

01:51:13.903 --> 01:51:15.211
What happened, sir?

01:51:16.506 --> 01:51:18.577
Sara said yes for the marriage.

01:51:19.042 --> 01:51:20.180
Isn't that good.

01:51:20.243 --> 01:51:21.654
Where's the drama?

01:51:22.145 --> 01:51:23.954
Easy is boring man.

01:51:24.047 --> 01:51:25.685
You're too good, sir.

01:51:29.018 --> 01:51:30.258
I like this troupe.

01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:31.628
Invite them for my wedding.

01:51:41.064 --> 01:51:42.475
Have you gone mad?

01:51:43.199 --> 01:51:45.145
Please don't make this mistake.

01:51:45.935 --> 01:51:51.715
Sara, I left your father because
he chose the wrong path in life.

01:51:53.676 --> 01:51:55.212
You'll ruin your life, dear.

01:51:56.245 --> 01:51:57.986
I never had a life...

01:51:59.949 --> 01:52:03.396
That's why I never feared losing it.

01:52:05.455 --> 01:52:07.162
But now I do.

01:52:09.092 --> 01:52:11.572
You have no idea...
how much I missed you both..

01:52:12.095 --> 01:52:13.631
All my childhood.

01:52:16.399 --> 01:52:18.345
I've made up my mind.

01:52:51.267 --> 01:52:52.371
God bless you.

01:52:54.103 --> 01:52:55.173
Why are you crying?

01:52:55.238 --> 01:52:57.115
Your father will be fine.

01:52:58.074 --> 01:53:01.146
I can't thank you enough
for everything you did for me.

01:53:03.045 --> 01:53:04.956
You cared for me.

01:53:05.715 --> 01:53:07.991
Risked your life to save me.

01:53:08.317 --> 01:53:10.058
Took me to Punjab.

01:53:10.486 --> 01:53:12.989
Showed me the world
of relationships.

01:53:13.089 --> 01:53:14.659
Gave me a new life.

01:53:16.592 --> 01:53:17.969
My mother.

01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:32.348
I love you.

01:53:42.518 --> 01:53:44.555
But I can't be with you.

01:53:48.524 --> 01:53:50.936
Because I can't lose my parents.

01:53:55.264 --> 01:53:56.937
I'll miss you.

01:53:58.968 --> 01:54:02.211
I really...

01:54:02.705 --> 01:54:04.343
really love you a lot.

01:54:06.142 --> 01:54:09.146
You don't worry,
you'll be fine.

01:54:10.279 --> 01:54:11.952
I am right here.

01:54:14.617 --> 01:54:16.688
I'll go and tell mom...

01:54:17.453 --> 01:54:18.090
Sara...

01:54:21.090 --> 01:54:23.934
No matter where a girl hails from,
but she does feel shy.

01:54:28.498 --> 01:54:30.205
So she told you?

01:54:31.467 --> 01:54:33.071
Yes, she did.

01:54:34.170 --> 01:54:37.014
She took her time, but...
better late than never.

01:54:39.442 --> 01:54:41.615
I wonder what's going to
happen tomorrow after the wedding.

01:54:41.677 --> 01:54:43.350
The Wedding's tomorrow.

01:54:43.412 --> 01:54:44.618
Wow!

01:54:48.217 --> 01:54:49.389
Mom, didn't I tell you that..

01:54:49.452 --> 01:54:51.295
I'm going to unite
Sara with her mom.

01:54:51.387 --> 01:54:53.367
And so I did.
Everyone's really happy.

01:54:53.422 --> 01:54:55.368
Well, that's good.

01:54:55.424 --> 01:54:57.961
And mom, another piece
of good news. - What?

01:54:58.294 --> 01:55:00.205
Sara finally admitted
that she loves me.

01:55:00.263 --> 01:55:02.174
And even I told her.

01:55:02.698 --> 01:55:05.542
I am really happy-
Raftaar... very happy.

01:55:06.102 --> 01:55:07.410
Bless you two.

01:55:07.470 --> 01:55:09.211
Bless you too, mom.

01:55:32.028 --> 01:55:40.028
"Come sweetheart and...
let me take you in my arms."

01:55:41.203 --> 01:55:49.203
"Come sweetheart and...
let me take you in my arms."

01:55:49.545 --> 01:55:53.687
"You're my life,
you're my destiny."

01:55:53.916 --> 01:55:57.693
"I am your Romeo,
and you're my Juliet."

01:55:58.054 --> 01:56:01.934
"How do I convey my love for you?"

01:56:02.191 --> 01:56:06.401
"All I can say is I see God in you."

01:56:08.164 --> 01:56:16.164
"Come sweetheart and...
let me take you in my arms."

01:56:16.505 --> 01:56:24.505
"Come sweetheart and...
let me take you in my arms."

01:56:41.931 --> 01:56:45.936
"You're the bond that
controls my soaring heart."

01:56:46.135 --> 01:56:50.106
"No one's gonna love
you as much as I do."

01:56:50.339 --> 01:56:54.287
"You're more gorgeous than Juliet,
more precious than diamonds."

01:56:54.443 --> 01:56:59.654
"Those crazy in love desire only you."

01:57:00.416 --> 01:57:08.416
"Come sweetheart and...
let me take you in my arms."

01:57:09.091 --> 01:57:17.091
"Come sweetheart and...
let me take you in my arms."

01:57:35.284 --> 01:57:40.233
"Come sweetheart... come to me.."

01:57:40.356 --> 01:57:44.600
"Come sweetheart... come to me.."

01:57:49.131 --> 01:57:50.109
Uncle...

01:57:50.166 --> 01:57:51.440
Drive faster.

01:57:53.636 --> 01:57:55.582
It's getting late, please.

01:57:56.372 --> 01:57:59.148
"...let me take you in my arms."

01:57:59.208 --> 01:58:07.208
"Come sweetheart and...
let me take you in my arms."

01:58:20.763 --> 01:58:22.504
Dear children of God.

01:58:22.565 --> 01:58:24.408
You've come to this church..

01:58:24.467 --> 01:58:26.504
So that lord may seal your love..

01:58:26.535 --> 01:58:27.536
In the presence of.

01:58:27.603 --> 01:58:30.049
Why so late?
I went to get these.

01:58:30.106 --> 01:58:33.087
What for? - It's necessary.
It's a happy occasion.

01:58:34.110 --> 01:58:36.283
- Isn't that Sara?
- Yes.

01:58:36.912 --> 01:58:38.516
And who's that with her?

01:58:39.115 --> 01:58:40.093
Mark.

01:58:40.282 --> 01:58:41.920
The one she's marrying.

01:58:43.919 --> 01:58:45.023
What's wrong?

01:58:45.554 --> 01:58:48.296
You said Sara told you everything.

01:58:50.292 --> 01:58:53.569
She made a compromise with her life.

01:58:54.663 --> 01:58:56.472
But what will happen to her now?

01:58:57.533 --> 01:58:58.443
Nice girl!

01:59:10.412 --> 01:59:13.450
- Do you Mark...
- Yes, yes I do.

01:59:14.183 --> 01:59:18.359
Do you, Sara Rana... take Mark
as your lawfully wedded husband?

01:59:19.922 --> 01:59:24.530
Do you, Sara Rana... take Mark
as your lawfully wedded husband?

01:59:34.470 --> 01:59:39.510
Do you, Sara Rana... take Mark
as your lawfully wedded husband?

01:59:45.080 --> 01:59:48.994
Do you, Sara Rana... take Mark
as your lawfully wedded husband?

01:59:57.459 --> 01:59:59.939
Triangle. Love triangle.

02:00:08.370 --> 02:00:09.440
I am too good, right?

02:00:10.172 --> 02:00:11.378
Stop.

02:00:14.243 --> 02:00:15.620
What are you doing?

02:00:15.678 --> 02:00:16.918
Leave him.

02:00:19.081 --> 02:00:20.219
Who are you?

02:00:20.950 --> 02:00:21.655
Singh!

02:00:22.518 --> 02:00:23.895
Raftaar Singh.

02:00:24.220 --> 02:00:27.531
Oh... Bond... James Bond!

02:00:28.524 --> 02:00:30.868
Sardar, this isn't Punjab.

02:00:30.893 --> 02:00:32.201
This is my area.

02:00:34.563 --> 02:00:36.042
Mark's area.

02:00:36.098 --> 02:00:40.513
Wherever Singh sets foot,
that becomes his area.

02:00:47.376 --> 02:00:48.446
I like it.

02:00:49.478 --> 02:00:50.650
Drama!

02:00:51.447 --> 02:00:52.983
I like it.

02:00:54.149 --> 02:00:56.095
This simple wedding was no fun,

02:00:56.151 --> 02:00:58.188
Easy is... boring!

02:01:01.657 --> 02:01:04.069
Go on... take my place.

02:01:06.495 --> 02:01:08.338
Show me your strength.

02:01:10.599 --> 02:01:12.044
Show me.

02:01:14.904 --> 02:01:17.942
Not here... outside the Church.

02:01:21.377 --> 02:01:25.223
What's a Sardar's
connection with Jesus?

02:01:25.948 --> 02:01:28.360
<i>Ek Om Kat!</i>

02:01:29.451 --> 02:01:31.658
My Guru taught me.

02:01:32.488 --> 02:01:36.095
Some address Him as Ram,
and some as Lord...

02:01:36.358 --> 02:01:39.202
Some address Him as
Gosai... and some as llahi.

02:01:39.495 --> 02:01:43.068
The Lord might be revered
in different ways and places.

02:01:43.165 --> 02:01:46.271
But the Lord's abode is one.

02:01:48.070 --> 02:01:49.048
Come on.

02:01:49.939 --> 02:01:50.974
Come.

02:03:39.448 --> 02:03:43.089
This pain's nothing compared
to the pain of your wedding.

02:03:50.125 --> 02:03:53.334
Please don't, he'll kill you.

02:03:55.564 --> 02:03:57.271
This is my battle.

02:04:02.404 --> 02:04:05.544
I will make sparrows capable
of fighting hawks.

02:04:06.942 --> 02:04:09.548
Turn jackals into lions...

02:04:11.647 --> 02:04:15.424
And when I alone fight
against a million...

02:04:16.552 --> 02:04:19.499
will I truly be
able to uphold my name.

02:04:29.998 --> 02:04:31.909
I am Singh.

02:04:33.302 --> 02:04:35.304
I am Singh.

02:04:39.341 --> 02:04:41.287
I am Singh.

02:04:48.917 --> 02:04:49.952
Come on, Raftaar.

02:04:50.052 --> 02:04:51.224
I am Singh.

02:04:53.021 --> 02:04:54.591
I am Singh.

02:05:09.972 --> 02:05:11.713
I am Singh.

02:05:13.442 --> 02:05:15.080
I am Singh.

02:05:16.979 --> 02:05:18.458
I am Singh.

02:05:41.603 --> 02:05:44.413
I am Singh.

02:06:27.049 --> 02:06:30.030
Raftaar!

02:06:36.458 --> 02:06:37.528
I like it.

02:06:39.127 --> 02:06:42.165
I underestimated you, Sardar.

02:06:43.498 --> 02:06:45.569
But I must say..

02:06:45.634 --> 02:06:47.671
I really loved your charade.

02:06:49.171 --> 02:06:50.149
You came here all the way
from Punjab for the girl.

02:06:50.205 --> 02:06:51.616
"You don't lack anything"

02:06:52.174 --> 02:06:53.653
except for concentration.

02:06:54.443 --> 02:06:56.514
And I want you to recognize yourself.

02:06:58.513 --> 02:07:00.618
If you delay, you have a lot to lose.

02:07:02.384 --> 02:07:05.297
I hope you won't quit this
job in the middle.

02:07:05.354 --> 02:07:06.958
I hope you won't quit
this job in the middle.

02:07:07.022 --> 02:07:09.525
I hope you won't quit this
job in the middle.

02:07:16.098 --> 02:07:17.600
Raftaar!

02:07:20.502 --> 02:07:22.209
Raftaar!

02:07:28.143 --> 02:07:31.613
Yeah... what is it?

02:07:44.526 --> 02:07:47.063
You are too good Sardar.

02:07:49.431 --> 02:07:51.411
You kicked everyone's arse.

02:07:51.466 --> 02:07:53.946
Right... it's my heart's desire.

02:07:54.036 --> 02:07:55.572
The desire to make you mine.

02:07:55.637 --> 02:07:59.084
I love you.
No, no, no... don't say that.

02:07:59.141 --> 02:08:00.586
I love you, Raftaar.

02:08:00.642 --> 02:08:02.087
I can't live without you.

02:08:02.144 --> 02:08:07.059
Last time you said that,
you tried to marry someone else.

02:08:07.115 --> 02:08:09.686
Tell me what this means?

02:08:09.918 --> 02:08:12.694
Moron... I'll learn your language too.

02:08:12.921 --> 02:08:14.662
I am not too great.

02:08:19.161 --> 02:08:20.640
Yeah, mom.

02:08:21.563 --> 02:08:23.338
Yes, everything's fine out here.

02:08:24.299 --> 02:08:27.246
Romania looks really nice from here.

02:08:28.203 --> 02:08:31.514
Mom, for the sake of God
I'll call you later.

02:08:32.074 --> 02:08:33.382
Yes, I will.

02:08:33.909 --> 02:08:36.287
I'll tell you later.

02:08:41.883 --> 02:08:45.353
Will you just keep talking...
or pull me up?

02:08:45.420 --> 02:08:47.024
I love you, Raftaar.

02:09:04.506 --> 02:09:06.110
Brother is back.

02:09:06.174 --> 02:09:08.313
Brother Raftaar's back!

02:09:08.377 --> 02:09:10.584
Brother Raftaar's back!

02:09:53.388 --> 02:09:54.662
Dance.

02:10:00.095 --> 02:10:01.665
Come on. Dance.

02:10:41.636 --> 02:10:44.207
"They call you
Bling-Bling... Mr. Singh."

02:10:44.272 --> 02:10:46.081
"You know baby, you're the king."

02:10:46.141 --> 02:10:48.121
"Bling-Bling... Mr. Singh."

02:10:49.144 --> 02:10:50.885
"I am Singh... you're Kaur."

02:10:50.912 --> 02:10:52.550
"We're meant for each other."

02:10:52.614 --> 02:10:54.389
"You look so gorgeous."

02:10:54.449 --> 02:10:56.156
"Baby, come into my arms."

02:10:56.218 --> 02:10:57.993
"I am Singh... you're Kaur."

02:10:58.053 --> 02:10:59.623
"We're meant for each other."

02:10:59.888 --> 02:11:01.390
"You look so gorgeous."

02:11:01.456 --> 02:11:03.367
"Baby, come into my arms."

02:11:03.425 --> 02:11:05.063
"I am Singh... you're Kaur."

02:11:05.126 --> 02:11:06.662
"We're meant for each other."

02:11:06.895 --> 02:11:08.431
"You look so gorgeous."

02:11:08.497 --> 02:11:09.601
"Baby..."

02:11:10.365 --> 02:11:13.642
"Baby... S I N G H...
the name's enough, you know it."

02:11:13.902 --> 02:11:14.437
"You that-ish..."

02:11:14.503 --> 02:11:18.007
"K.I. N.G... We're the kings,
with a big heart and bigger courage."

02:11:18.073 --> 02:11:19.609
"I squander B.I.G money."

02:11:19.674 --> 02:11:21.415
"The papers talk only about me."

02:11:21.476 --> 02:11:25.117
"I have many sycophants
like you back home."

02:11:25.180 --> 02:11:26.557
"Come to my home and take a look."

02:11:26.615 --> 02:11:28.526
"I even show hospitality to my enemy."

02:11:28.583 --> 02:11:30.324
"I am quite capable alone.."

02:11:30.385 --> 02:11:32.092
"...I can face a million enemies."

02:11:32.153 --> 02:11:33.655
"My heart's filled with courage."

02:11:33.922 --> 02:11:35.595
"I rule everyone's heart."

02:11:35.657 --> 02:11:37.034
"I am different from you baby."

02:11:37.092 --> 02:11:39.265
"I always wear my crown."

02:11:40.529 --> 02:11:42.304
"I am Singh... you're Kaur."

02:11:42.364 --> 02:11:44.071
"We're meant for each other."

02:11:44.132 --> 02:11:45.975
"You look so gorgeous."

02:11:46.034 --> 02:11:47.536
"Baby, come into my arms."

02:11:47.602 --> 02:11:49.343
"I am Singh... you're Kaur."

02:11:49.404 --> 02:11:51.179
"We're meant for each other."

02:11:51.239 --> 02:11:52.980
"You look so gorgeous."

02:11:53.074 --> 02:11:54.144
"Baby..."

02:11:55.210 --> 02:11:59.056
"I'm the queen
here... everyone knows it."

02:11:59.114 --> 02:12:01.151
"I see..."

02:12:01.716 --> 02:12:05.721
"There's always a
queue of boys behind me."

02:12:05.954 --> 02:12:08.195
"Look...I am here too."

02:12:09.391 --> 02:12:12.998
"I'm the queen
here... everyone knows it."

02:12:13.061 --> 02:12:16.201
"There's always
a queue of boys behind me."

02:12:16.264 --> 02:12:18.972
"I admit... yes I do.."

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:20.570
"That you are my life."

02:12:20.635 --> 02:12:24.014
"I am your fan too... sweetheart."

02:12:24.906 --> 02:12:26.579
"I am Singh... you're Kaur."

02:12:26.641 --> 02:12:28.348

02:12:30.178 --> 02:12:31.953
"Baby, come into my arms."

"We're meant for each other."

02:12:35.417 --> 02:12:37.226
"You look so gorgeous."

02:12:37.285 --> 02:12:38.355
"Baby..."

02:12:49.564 --> 02:12:51.441
"I am Singh... you're Kaur."

02:12:51.499 --> 02:12:53.206
"We're meant for each other."

02:12:53.268 --> 02:12:54.941
"You look so gorgeous."

02:12:54.970 --> 02:12:56.643
"Baby, come into my arms."

02:12:56.705 --> 02:12:58.446
"I am Singh... you're Kaur."

02:12:58.506 --> 02:13:00.281
"We're meant for each other."

02:13:00.342 --> 02:13:01.946
"You look so gorgeous."

02:13:01.977 --> 02:13:03.217
"Baby..."

02:13:04.312 --> 02:13:08.226

here... everyone knows it."
