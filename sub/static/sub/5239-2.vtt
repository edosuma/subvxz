- Previously on Blunt Talk...
- Oh, no.

00:08.054 --> 00:11.500
Well, Gardner said they're either looking
to cancel the show or suspend you.

00:11.509 --> 00:14.508
Take these.
It's a kind of speed.

00:14.510 --> 00:17.044
I gave you three Ambien
and not three Provigil.

00:17.046 --> 00:19.713
Doctor thought you might
need this to wake up.

00:19.715 --> 00:22.349
And so I ask you,
the American people,

00:22.351 --> 00:25.436
to wield the most powerful
weapon there is.

00:25.438 --> 00:27.721
The truth.

00:27.723 --> 00:29.723
Oh, my God!

00:29.725 --> 00:31.191
Major?

00:31.193 --> 00:33.861
Major?
Don't leave me.

Harry.

02:01.784 --> 02:04.234
Oh, thank God.

02:04.236 --> 02:05.819
Are you all right?

02:05.821 --> 02:09.990
That was magnificent.

02:09.991 --> 02:12.826
There was showgirls
and feathers.

02:14.163 --> 02:18.298
And I saw my mother's face
in a looking glass.

02:18.300 --> 02:21.752
It was all
so beautiful.

02:21.754 --> 02:24.471
Oh, it's all right,
everyone.

02:24.473 --> 02:25.672
I'm fine.

Oh, fuck,
we're still on the air.

02:29.729 --> 02:33.514
My dear viewers,
I think I may just have had

02:33.516 --> 02:35.015
a near-death experience.

02:35.017 --> 02:37.818
If so,
then I'm happy to report

02:37.820 --> 02:40.854
that in heaven there's
a lot of dancing and joy.

02:40.856 --> 02:45.075
However, I think, and I'm sure
you would all agree with me,

02:45.077 --> 02:48.412
it would be prudent
to take a commercial break.

02:48.414 --> 02:50.468
I remain
and always will be

02:50.483 --> 02:54.568
Walter Blunt,
right here, right now.

02:57.657 --> 03:00.241
You've had
quite the day, Major.

03:00.243 --> 03:02.409
I'm proud of you
for not dying.

03:02.411 --> 03:04.078
Thank you, Harry.

03:04.080 --> 03:07.798
The gods, you know, have
given me a second chance.

03:07.800 --> 03:09.917
I mean to make
the most of it.

03:09.919 --> 03:11.969
Now it's time to rest.

03:11.971 --> 03:14.138
What did Shakespeare say?

03:14.140 --> 03:18.976
Sleep that knits a scarf
around your neck like a noose.

03:18.978 --> 03:20.511
No, Harry.

03:20.513 --> 03:25.065
"Sleep that knits up
the raveled sleeve of care,"

03:26.652 --> 03:29.770
The death
of each day's life,

03:29.772 --> 03:34.658
"sore labor's bath,
Balm of hurt minds."

03:34.660 --> 03:37.695
No, you're right, Major.
There's no mention of a scarf.

03:37.697 --> 03:40.281
But you get my meaning.
Time to rest.

03:40.283 --> 03:43.834
So have a sip
of mother's milk

03:43.836 --> 03:45.586
and it'll be night-night
for the major

03:45.588 --> 03:47.538
and night-night
for good old Harry.

03:47.540 --> 03:50.791
But I am serious about
this second chance business.

03:52.261 --> 03:55.629
I saw myself tonight
as a child.

03:55.631 --> 03:58.966
And I realized never having
met my own father,

03:58.968 --> 04:02.970
I need to be a better father
to the American people.

04:02.972 --> 04:05.272
And, of course,
to my own children.

04:05.274 --> 04:06.974
Worthwhile goal,
sir, but...

04:06.976 --> 04:09.643
No, I need to revitalize
Blunt Talk.

04:09.645 --> 04:13.447
I have to take care
of my viewers.

04:13.449 --> 04:15.616
And I have to take
care of you, Major.

04:15.618 --> 04:17.535
You had
a terrible shock.

04:17.536 --> 04:19.320
Now, please,
take your medicine.

04:20.656 --> 04:23.207
All right, Harry.
You know best.

04:32.418 --> 04:33.884
That's much better.

04:35.671 --> 04:37.838
So...

04:39.141 --> 04:40.808
let's put our cares away,

04:40.810 --> 04:43.010
have a peaceful,
restorative weekend.

04:43.012 --> 04:45.896
Mmm. Now, what would you like
me to read to you tonight?

04:45.898 --> 04:48.649
We have Rabelais,
Winnie-the-Pooh, and the Koran.

04:48.651 --> 04:52.319
No, no. No reading tonight, Harry.
I'm too tired.

04:52.321 --> 04:54.438
Just pass me
my eye mask, please.

04:54.440 --> 04:57.241
- Thank you.
- Very good, Major.

05:04.116 --> 05:06.000
Good night, Harry.

05:11.374 --> 05:13.707
Good night, Major.

05:27.356 --> 05:29.106
How's it looking, Major?

05:29.108 --> 05:32.226
I'm losing sensation
in my right calf muscle

05:32.228 --> 05:33.644
and would like
to sit down.

05:33.646 --> 05:36.030
Not yet, Harry.
Just hold still.

05:36.032 --> 05:38.816
The sun is very specific
at the moment.

05:38.818 --> 05:41.619
The way that it's glinting
off of your bald spot,

05:41.621 --> 05:43.787
it's just like something
out of the Renaissance.

05:43.789 --> 05:46.240
- I have to capture it.
- Righto.

05:48.244 --> 05:50.160
For God's sake!

05:50.162 --> 05:51.879
Oh, sorry about that.

05:51.881 --> 05:53.547
Can I sit
down now, Major?

05:53.549 --> 05:55.749
I'm losing sensation
in both calf muscles.

05:55.751 --> 05:58.085
Oh, sit down, Harry.
And quit your whinging.

05:58.087 --> 06:01.889
You must be the new neighbor. The renter.

06:01.891 --> 06:04.341
Thanks.
I'm Ronnie.

06:04.343 --> 06:08.395
You have destroyed my painting
with your carelessness.

06:08.397 --> 06:11.065
- Sorry.
- It's 8:00 in the morning.

06:11.067 --> 06:13.267
Don't you think it's a bit
early for volleyball?

06:13.269 --> 06:14.935
No, it's not too early.

06:14.937 --> 06:17.104
We've been up
all night on MDMA.

06:17.106 --> 06:19.106
You know, Jolly Molly.

06:20.693 --> 06:23.360
All right.
There you go.

06:26.699 --> 06:29.033
That's quite the nudist
party you're having.

06:29.035 --> 06:30.868
You seem to be having
a party yourself.

06:30.870 --> 06:32.953
Who's the talent
sitting on the marble?

06:32.955 --> 06:35.039
What do you mean,
talent?

06:35.041 --> 06:37.791
I saw what that boy
has between his legs.

06:37.793 --> 06:40.544
- And what of it? 
- I produce high-end erotic films.

06:40.546 --> 06:43.097
I'm always on the lookout for an
everyman with a cock like that.

06:43.099 --> 06:45.766
It's my holy grail.
Who is he, your boyfriend?

06:45.768 --> 06:48.102
- No, he's my man.
- Your man?

06:48.104 --> 06:51.605
My man! My valet.
What do you think I mean?

06:51.607 --> 06:53.807
I don't know.

06:53.809 --> 06:58.145
But if Red ever
wants to make some extra money,

06:58.147 --> 07:01.365
here's my card.

07:01.367 --> 07:03.484
Yes? Rosalie.

07:03.486 --> 07:05.869
You sure?

07:05.871 --> 07:08.288
Yes, all right. Bye.

07:08.290 --> 07:10.908
Harry, get dressed. We've
got to go to the studio.

07:10.910 --> 07:13.210
Hey, it was nice
meeting you, neighbor.

07:13.212 --> 07:16.880
And by the way, I saw how you stood
up to those cops on YouTube.

07:16.882 --> 07:20.250
You are a white
Rodney King. A hero.

07:20.252 --> 07:24.755
I do not consider my conduct
that evening to be heroic.

07:24.757 --> 07:26.256
And going forward,

07:26.258 --> 07:29.343
keep your volleyballs
your side of the hedge!

07:31.013 --> 07:33.597
Dumbass doesn't even
know what gold he's got.

07:33.599 --> 07:35.899
Hey, I'm serving.

07:35.901 --> 07:39.019
It's a massive hurricane, Walter.

07:39.021 --> 07:40.687
They baptized
her Gina.

07:40.689 --> 07:42.689
It's gonna be
a huge story.

07:42.691 --> 07:44.024
And I want you there.

07:44.026 --> 07:45.859
It makes landfall
in Galveston tonight.

07:45.861 --> 07:48.912
Bob, I'm a newsman.
I'm not a weatherman.

07:48.914 --> 07:50.697
Okay, yes,
you are a newsman.

07:50.699 --> 07:52.533
But you are also
the news

07:52.535 --> 07:54.501
and I want to keep
your momentum going.

07:54.503 --> 07:56.036
You were terrific
last night.

07:56.038 --> 07:59.039
Almost dying, best thing
you've ever done.

07:59.041 --> 08:00.457
Oh, thank you.

08:00.459 --> 08:01.842
How are you,
by the way?

08:01.844 --> 08:03.377
Oh, I'm fine, but...

08:03.379 --> 08:06.630
Good, putting you in a storm
is going to show the world

08:06.632 --> 08:09.049
that you are fit
and sane.

08:09.051 --> 08:11.468
Well, of
course I'm fit and sane.

08:11.470 --> 08:13.220
Which is the rea...

08:13.222 --> 08:16.023
Which is the reason why I
should not be wasting my time

08:16.025 --> 08:18.976
standing in the rain telling
people I'm standing in the rain.

08:18.978 --> 08:21.895
My viewers are expecting
something more from me.

08:21.897 --> 08:24.531
- Like what?
- Answers. Insight.

08:24.533 --> 08:26.033
Revelation.

08:26.035 --> 08:29.703
Hey, on the street
they're calling me a hero.

08:29.705 --> 08:32.739
A white Rodney King.

08:34.076 --> 08:35.993
I'm supposed to like
the sound of that?

08:35.995 --> 08:39.296
Oh, well, actually, it was
only one deranged individual.

08:39.298 --> 08:41.799
I do not care. You are going to Galveston.

08:41.801 --> 08:43.833
I agree with Bob.
You should go.

08:43.836 --> 08:47.588
Thank you. I gave you a
second chance last night.

08:47.590 --> 08:49.923
I can take it away.

08:49.925 --> 08:52.593
Bob giveth,
Bob taketh.

08:52.595 --> 08:54.094
Juice?

08:59.602 --> 09:01.151
- Hello.
- Hey.

09:01.153 --> 09:03.320
- Here's your coffee.
- Thanks.

09:04.857 --> 09:06.273
I can't believe
he's going to Galveston.

09:06.275 --> 09:08.408
I can't believe
he's still alive.

09:08.410 --> 09:10.027
Don't tell Walter,
but that was actually

09:10.029 --> 09:12.079
OxyContin
in my Ambien bottle.

09:12.081 --> 09:13.997
Oh, he's an ex-Marine.
He can handle it.

09:13.999 --> 09:15.916
I don't know if he can
handle prison, though.

09:15.918 --> 09:18.202
The Jewish lawyers
are all over it.

09:18.204 --> 09:19.453
Oh, good.

09:19.455 --> 09:21.371
So you have no problem
with what I just said?

09:21.373 --> 09:23.123
'Cause I'm Jewish.
You know that?

09:23.125 --> 09:25.459
- Morning.
- Where'd you get those mugs?

09:25.461 --> 09:27.761
All I found in the kitchen
were these paper cups.

09:27.763 --> 09:31.632
Oh, and Jim's sushi from
yesterday, which I ate. Sorry.

09:31.634 --> 09:33.300
That wasn't from
yesterday.

09:34.854 --> 09:37.638
Harry, find out
where Galveston is.

09:37.640 --> 09:39.439
- Texas, Major.
- Texas?

09:39.441 --> 09:42.109
Oh, Lord. I thought it
was the title of a song.

09:42.111 --> 09:44.811
I can't believe
you sided with Gardner.

09:44.813 --> 09:46.813
You know how I feel
about the weather.

09:46.815 --> 09:48.949
This isn't just about
the weather, Walter.

09:48.951 --> 09:52.402
This is climate change.
This is mass extinction.

09:52.404 --> 09:54.321
It's end days.

09:54.323 --> 09:57.908
And Anderson Cooper's
gonna be there.

09:57.910 --> 09:59.326
Really?

09:59.328 --> 10:02.379
Well, these are biblical
times environmentally.

10:02.381 --> 10:05.749
And Anderson isn't
the only silver fox

10:05.751 --> 10:07.668
who can look good
in a rain slicker.

10:07.670 --> 10:09.169
Silver fox?

10:09.171 --> 10:11.171
A man's head
is not the only place

10:11.173 --> 10:13.891
he grows hair, Rosalie,
as you well know.

10:15.344 --> 10:17.344
Now, first things first,
I want to thank you all

10:17.346 --> 10:19.897
for supporting me
during my crisis last night.

10:19.899 --> 10:21.348
It's okay, Walter,
we're absolutely...

10:21.350 --> 10:24.318
But let's pretend
we are in Stalin's Russia

10:24.320 --> 10:27.020
and erase it from
our collective memory.

10:27.022 --> 10:29.356
- Can we do that?
- It was very upsetting, Walter.

10:29.358 --> 10:31.158
I don't know
if we can forget about

10:31.160 --> 10:33.327
you collapsing 'cause of
the drugs I gave you.

10:33.329 --> 10:35.028
- Jim. Nyet.
- You almost died.

10:35.030 --> 10:36.863
- Nyet!
- Got it, Stalin's Russia.

10:36.865 --> 10:38.498
Good, thank you.
Now, Martin,

10:38.500 --> 10:40.200
you're coming with me
and Harry to Galveston.

10:40.202 --> 10:42.502
Why?
Am I being punished?

10:42.504 --> 10:46.373
No, it's because you are
crafty and resourceful.

10:46.375 --> 10:48.292
And that'll be good
on a mission like this.

10:48.294 --> 10:50.711
Now, the rest of you
will run things from here.

10:50.713 --> 10:52.296
But why are you
going, Walter?

10:52.298 --> 10:54.181
I thought playing a
weatherman was beneath you.

10:54.183 --> 10:56.383
I'm going, Celia,
because last night

10:56.385 --> 10:58.969
I promised our viewers
I would tell them the truth.

10:58.971 --> 11:02.606
Now, this freakish storm
is the perfect backdrop

11:02.608 --> 11:05.559
for talking about what we are
doing to the environment.

11:05.561 --> 11:09.396
But the truth about climate
change is devastating, Walter.

11:09.398 --> 11:12.032
No one wants to hear
we're committing mass suicide.

11:12.034 --> 11:15.702
Exactly, so let's also
give them hope.

11:17.156 --> 11:19.039
I might have died
last night.

11:19.041 --> 11:22.459
From now on, I want to
be in the hope business.

11:22.461 --> 11:25.746
Yeah, but I'm not sure that hope
and truth go together very well.

11:25.748 --> 11:27.748
Just start Googling
and see

11:27.750 --> 11:31.468
if there is any hope out there
that might also be true.

11:31.470 --> 11:34.054
Come on, Martin. We've got
to find rain slickers.

11:34.056 --> 11:36.173
Yes, Major.

11:43.899 --> 11:47.267
Do I have time to go to the
men's room before boarding?

11:47.269 --> 11:48.935
Uh, yes,
that should be fine.

11:48.937 --> 11:51.989
Thank you. Harry, I'm going to the loo.

11:51.991 --> 11:54.107
- Yes, Major.
- Martin, stay where you are.

11:56.612 --> 11:59.363
Move along.
Move along.

12:00.833 --> 12:03.367
- All clear, Major.
- Thank you, Harry.

12:14.430 --> 12:16.763
Oh, shit.

12:50.466 --> 12:53.550
Sorry, pal.
Loo's off-limits.

12:58.257 --> 13:00.307
Oh!

13:04.563 --> 13:06.396
Fuck.

13:16.909 --> 13:19.192
Ladies and gentlemen,
now boarding all groups.

13:19.194 --> 13:21.194
All groups can now board.

13:25.033 --> 13:27.451
For God's sake!

13:37.546 --> 13:39.129
Oh, thank you.

13:39.131 --> 13:40.714
Have a good flight.

13:47.689 --> 13:49.723
Shit.

13:50.893 --> 13:53.059
Damn it!

13:55.197 --> 13:57.114
Oh, God!

13:57.116 --> 13:59.232
Oh, ah!

14:04.123 --> 14:05.956
Shit.

14:05.958 --> 14:07.541
Shit!

14:07.543 --> 14:09.626
Oh, fuck!

14:10.796 --> 14:12.662
Come the fuck on!

14:12.664 --> 14:15.248
Oh. Oh. Ah.

14:21.473 --> 14:22.973
No!

14:24.977 --> 14:26.426
Major?

14:26.428 --> 14:28.145
Come on, Walter.
Pick up.

14:28.147 --> 14:30.680
Pick up, Walter.
Pick up.

14:35.070 --> 14:37.354
Oh!

14:38.524 --> 14:40.690
Damn.

14:40.692 --> 14:42.609
Yes, Martin?

14:42.611 --> 14:45.579
What?
You're on the plane?

14:47.115 --> 14:49.416
- Shit! Harry!
- Shit.

14:49.418 --> 14:51.668
We're here!
We're here!

14:51.670 --> 14:53.453
Oh, thank God.

14:53.455 --> 14:57.007
I am so sorry. There's no boarding.
The plane is closed.

14:57.009 --> 14:59.426
That's not possible.

14:59.428 --> 15:01.211
You said I could go.

15:01.213 --> 15:03.013
I know, but we boarded
very quickly.

15:03.015 --> 15:05.015
It's the last flight to Galveston.
We need to get it out.

15:05.017 --> 15:07.551
You must open the gate
and let us on board the plane.

15:07.553 --> 15:09.386
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

15:09.388 --> 15:13.390
You see, I have to be
in Galveston tonight.

15:13.392 --> 15:14.941
I have a very important
broadcast.

15:14.943 --> 15:17.527
Ooh, I'm sorry, Mr. Blunt.
It's a federal law.

15:17.529 --> 15:20.647
But I don't care about
asinine federal laws!

15:25.988 --> 15:27.821
I must be on that plane.

15:27.823 --> 15:29.122
I'm sorry.
Thank you.

15:29.124 --> 15:30.707
- My dear...
- I'm sorry. Thank you.

15:30.709 --> 15:32.993
- My dear...
- I'm sorry. Thank you.

15:34.997 --> 15:37.330
I need air.
I can't breathe.

15:37.332 --> 15:39.833
This is a disaster.

15:39.835 --> 15:41.551
We have to be adults.

15:41.553 --> 15:44.921
I'm calling Gardner and telling
him you missed the flight.

15:44.923 --> 15:48.008
No, it's too humiliating.
It's too unprofessional.

15:48.010 --> 15:49.342
He'll cancel us.

15:49.344 --> 15:51.344
I'm only one day
into my comeback.

15:51.346 --> 15:54.431
Oh, It's all right, Walter. Everyone
misses flights once in a while.

15:54.433 --> 15:56.149
I once brought
a gun on a plane.

15:56.151 --> 15:57.934
No, Celia,
this is different.

15:57.936 --> 16:00.987
I keep undermining
myself.

16:00.989 --> 16:04.024
Something is wrong. I never
used to be this reckless.

16:04.026 --> 16:06.192
You've always
been reckless.

16:06.194 --> 16:07.527
But you were
better at it.

16:07.529 --> 16:10.864
Oh, Harry, this is a crisis,
not a social gathering.

16:10.866 --> 16:14.534
Tea is essential during a crisis, sir.
You know that.

16:14.536 --> 16:18.004
Look, I know this is nuts,
but... never mind.

16:18.006 --> 16:20.373
No, no, no. Jim, what is it? I'm desperate.

16:20.375 --> 16:22.876
I will take anything.
Come on, spit it out.

16:22.878 --> 16:25.512
Well, we could make it
look like you're in Galveston.

16:25.514 --> 16:28.048
- Okay, what do you mean?
- Fake it in front of a green screen.

16:28.050 --> 16:31.468
Like when Cokie Roberts pretended
to report from Capitol Hill.

16:31.470 --> 16:33.520
Oh, yes, I remember that.

16:33.522 --> 16:37.223
Oh, and I remember...
Oh, Cokie.

16:37.225 --> 16:39.309
All legs,
no common sense.

16:39.311 --> 16:40.727
Yeah, that's Cokie.

16:40.729 --> 16:44.564
So, my idea is that
we'll have Martin

16:44.566 --> 16:46.533
send us the footage and then
we'll just put you in it.

16:46.535 --> 16:48.818
But we will need someone
who has a studio.

16:48.820 --> 16:50.704
And someone who
can keep their mouth shut.

16:50.706 --> 16:52.822
Someone discreet
and dishonest.

16:52.824 --> 16:54.741
There's lots of people
like that in LA.

16:54.743 --> 16:57.243
But how many have got
their own green screen?

16:57.245 --> 16:58.962
Harry, is that you?

16:58.964 --> 17:02.999
Why is there a red slash
across your...

17:03.001 --> 17:06.752
very large, beautiful,
otherworldly penis?

17:06.755 --> 17:09.556
I'm the muse.
Ask the artist.

17:09.558 --> 17:12.509
That is not an intentional
red slash, Celia.

17:12.511 --> 17:14.560
My work is figurative.

17:14.563 --> 17:16.179
That was caused by...

17:19.067 --> 17:22.852
someone discreet
and dishonest.

17:41.790 --> 17:44.124
Hey, come on in.

17:46.294 --> 17:49.462
I appreciate you
paying in cash, Walter.

17:49.464 --> 17:51.097
These are dark days
for us.

17:51.099 --> 17:54.434
The mandatory condom laws
have made it impossible

17:54.436 --> 17:57.470
to shoot in LA.

17:57.472 --> 17:59.973
Pun intended. That's all
well and good, but...

17:59.975 --> 18:03.810
So, I'm trying to stay local.
I refuse to outsource to Vegas.

18:03.812 --> 18:07.313
I am loyal to my people, but the
health department is after my ass.

18:07.315 --> 18:08.732
I'm sorry
for your struggles,

18:08.734 --> 18:10.867
but our interest
is in your green screen.

18:10.869 --> 18:13.570
- We have to get to work.
- Of course.

18:13.572 --> 18:15.705
But there's something else
I need from you. Drink?

18:15.707 --> 18:19.075
No.
What else do you need?

18:21.046 --> 18:24.080
One of my actors got the
drip and there is a scene

18:24.082 --> 18:27.667
that we have to shoot today, so I need Red.

18:29.004 --> 18:32.255
- No, absolutely not.
- Red, what do you think?

18:32.257 --> 18:34.340
- Can you speak for yourself?
- You want me to do what?

18:34.342 --> 18:38.228
I want you to make love to a beautiful
woman in front of a camera.

18:41.683 --> 18:43.850
- Not possible.
- But why?

18:45.353 --> 18:47.687
I'm unable to enjoy sex.

18:47.689 --> 18:51.408
At the moment of congress,
I experience shame

18:51.410 --> 18:53.576
and anticipate punishment.

18:53.578 --> 18:56.529
Harry, you never
told me this.

18:56.531 --> 18:59.582
Well, I've never been asked to be
the star of an erotic film before.

18:59.584 --> 19:03.369
Supporting, actually. But a great role.
Meaty. Lots of pathos.

19:03.371 --> 19:06.206
Doesn't matter. The answer,
I'm afraid, is still no.

19:06.208 --> 19:08.425
Well, then the deal's off.
I need the money,

19:08.427 --> 19:10.877
but getting someone like you on
film is more important to me.

19:10.879 --> 19:13.713
You can't be serious.

19:13.715 --> 19:17.350
I am.
I believe in what I do.

19:17.352 --> 19:20.720
I bring people joy!
What do you do?!

19:22.891 --> 19:26.443
Harry, how bad can it be?

19:26.445 --> 19:28.695
My career is at stake.

19:28.697 --> 19:31.397
Remember the Falklands.

19:31.399 --> 19:33.700
Do it for the lads.

19:38.540 --> 19:41.207
Whom might
I be making love to?

19:43.128 --> 19:45.128
Sylvia, come in here.

19:52.587 --> 19:53.970
Yeah, Ronnie?

19:57.759 --> 20:00.760
I'll try to overcome
my issues, Major.

20:04.065 --> 20:07.100
Forgive me for being
the only sane person here,

20:07.102 --> 20:09.435
but this has got fuck-up
written all over it.

20:09.437 --> 20:11.237
You wanted me
to cover this storm.

20:11.239 --> 20:15.441
Yes, in Galveston. Not in a porn
studio with a green screen.

20:16.361 --> 20:19.112
Do I consider this
to be ideal? No.

20:19.114 --> 20:23.449
I have been betrayed by the FAA
and modern bathroom technology.

20:23.451 --> 20:25.785
Now get on board, Rosalie.

20:25.787 --> 20:28.755
What do you two have for me?
Anything hopeful?

20:28.757 --> 20:30.507
Um, not exactly hopeful.

20:30.509 --> 20:33.760
They're finding microplastics
in the ocean's food chain.

20:33.762 --> 20:35.461
And if we try to get
off fossil fuels,

20:35.463 --> 20:38.014
the Saudis and the oil companies
will start a massive war.

20:38.016 --> 20:41.184
Yeah, in 30 years, Alaska's
gonna be the new Miami Beach.

20:41.186 --> 20:43.303
And eight-year-old boys
are wearing bras.

20:43.305 --> 20:44.771
Why, because of obesity?

20:44.773 --> 20:46.806
No, because
they have breasts.

20:46.808 --> 20:48.725
Pharmaceuticals
in the water table

20:48.727 --> 20:50.643
are affecting puberty
and gender patterns.

20:50.645 --> 20:52.478
Good Lord.

20:52.480 --> 20:56.533
Isn't there anything hopeful that
I can offer the American people?

20:56.535 --> 20:57.984
Anything uplifting?

20:57.986 --> 21:00.620
Well, there's a family in LA, in Topanga,

21:00.622 --> 21:02.989
living in a harmonious,
zero-waste manner.

21:02.991 --> 21:05.708
I mean, they're hoping that by having
no impact, they'll have an impact.

21:05.710 --> 21:07.710
Yes, that's what I need.

21:07.712 --> 21:10.964
A shift in consciousness
at the grassroots level.

21:10.966 --> 21:12.999
Celia, that is a message
I can work with.

21:13.001 --> 21:14.717
Watch out
for that cable, Walter.

21:14.719 --> 21:17.003
We have a problem.

21:17.005 --> 21:19.505
Red is weepy and won't take his Viagra.

21:19.507 --> 21:22.508
Says if he can't do it naturally,
then he won't do it at all.

21:22.510 --> 21:24.677
Oh, shit.
He's too prideful.

21:24.679 --> 21:26.346
Oh, that's Martin.

21:26.348 --> 21:27.730
He's arrived at Galveston.

21:27.732 --> 21:29.148
He's gonna meet the local
crew at the marina.

21:29.150 --> 21:30.567
And Shelly's standing by
in the control room.

21:30.569 --> 21:32.018
Yes, right,
what I want from you...

21:32.020 --> 21:33.937
Did you hear
what I just said?

21:33.939 --> 21:36.906
Red is upset. You have to do something.

21:36.908 --> 21:40.660
I am about to tape my opening
salvo on Hurricane Gina.

21:40.662 --> 21:43.112
I cannot hold Harry's
hand right now.

21:43.114 --> 21:46.532
Take down the green screen.
This shoot is off.

21:46.534 --> 21:49.586
Are you
blackmailing me again?

21:49.588 --> 21:54.207
Yes, I have to deliver this
picture to the Asian market.

21:54.209 --> 21:55.592
I need this scene.

21:55.594 --> 21:57.043
For God's sake,
be reasonable.

21:57.045 --> 22:01.047
Take the green screen down!

22:01.049 --> 22:03.683
Rosalie, Celia,
go and talk to Harry.

22:03.685 --> 22:05.885
Try and cheer him up.

22:05.887 --> 22:07.637
You want us
to fluff Harry?

22:07.639 --> 22:09.305
Just fluff
his confidence.

22:09.307 --> 22:11.024
I don't know what else
to suggest.

22:11.026 --> 22:12.892
I could try
talking to him.

22:12.894 --> 22:16.229
You know, just two guys
talking around a campfire.

22:16.231 --> 22:19.949
Forget Harry.
Walter, I'm calling Gardner.

22:19.951 --> 22:22.986
No! I would rather
go out like this.

22:22.988 --> 22:25.488
A fool's mission
is still a mission.

22:25.490 --> 22:28.574
And maybe this illusion
will work.

22:28.576 --> 22:31.911
I have to lie
to tell the truth.

22:31.913 --> 22:34.464
All right, Walter.

22:34.466 --> 22:35.915
If that's what you want.

22:35.917 --> 22:38.835
Celia and I
will take care of Harry.

22:38.837 --> 22:41.554
And, darling,
lose the hat.

22:44.092 --> 22:45.808
What's the matter, Harry?

22:45.810 --> 22:47.927
What's at the root
of all this?

22:47.929 --> 22:49.595
Don't know.

22:49.597 --> 22:51.564
My mother.

22:51.566 --> 22:53.349
She liked things clean.

22:53.351 --> 22:56.853
Her hands were always
red and chapped.

22:58.106 --> 22:59.989
There was also
the war.

22:59.991 --> 23:03.693
I heard you were
very brave in the war.

23:03.695 --> 23:05.745
Not really.

23:05.747 --> 23:08.081
I've just never
been much for sex.

23:08.083 --> 23:09.916
Oh, you poor dear.

23:09.918 --> 23:11.668
No, it's all right,
actually.

23:11.670 --> 23:13.036
I have alcohol
and gambling.

23:13.038 --> 23:15.288
My happy plate
is more than full.

23:18.410 --> 23:22.695
I just thought you should know that
I am genuinely attracted to you.

23:22.697 --> 23:24.113
- You are?
- Yes.

23:24.115 --> 23:27.033
In college I had a thing
for all my professors.

23:27.035 --> 23:28.785
So did I.
I loved them.

23:28.787 --> 23:30.870
But I never did
anything about it.

23:30.872 --> 23:33.790
Did you really not?
That's ironic, isn't it?

23:33.792 --> 23:36.209
'Cause you're a porn actress.

23:36.211 --> 23:38.761
And 'cause I absolutely
did all of them.

23:38.763 --> 23:40.930
I mean, pretty much. And sometimes
you'd knock and there was no one in...

23:40.932 --> 23:44.183
So, you remind me
of those professors

23:44.185 --> 23:46.469
and I see this
as my second chance.

23:55.280 --> 23:57.530
Ronnie said
this was a good part.

23:59.284 --> 24:03.569
As I stand
in this biblical deluge,

24:03.571 --> 24:05.288
the city in a panic,

24:05.290 --> 24:08.041
all I can think
is that this storm

24:08.043 --> 24:10.576
is yet another
frightening reminder

24:10.578 --> 24:12.662
of our
environmental crisis.

24:12.664 --> 24:16.916
Microplastics in the ocean,
disappearing coastlines,

24:16.918 --> 24:19.752
and the sissifying
of young boys.

24:19.754 --> 24:23.089
But as someone who you saw

24:23.091 --> 24:26.259
nearly die last night,
let me tell you

24:26.261 --> 24:29.145
that we must
not lose hope.

24:29.147 --> 24:31.764
If we all change
in some way,

24:31.766 --> 24:35.151
the ripple effect
will be enormous.

24:35.153 --> 24:38.154
What I am calling for,
America,

24:38.156 --> 24:40.990
is a shift in consciousness

24:40.992 --> 24:43.576
at the grassroots level.

24:43.578 --> 24:46.079
But it has
to begin with you.

24:46.081 --> 24:48.948
Because as these
torrential rains

24:48.950 --> 24:52.118
bear down on us, our
leaders are doing nothing.

24:52.120 --> 24:54.704
Nothing!
They're...

24:57.008 --> 25:00.626
♪ They're singing
in the rain ♪

25:00.628 --> 25:03.629
- ♪ Just singing... ♪
- Hey, stop. Cut, stop it.

25:03.631 --> 25:05.598
Cut! Shut off the water.
Stop. Cut.

25:05.600 --> 25:08.017
What's the matter? Why did you stop?
It was going beautifully.

25:08.019 --> 25:10.636
You didn't tell me you were gonna
do a dance number, Walter.

25:10.638 --> 25:13.940
It just came to me. I was
thinking outside the box.

25:13.942 --> 25:16.642
Anderson Cooper would
never be this creative.

25:16.644 --> 25:20.480
It won't go over well. People are probably
going to die during this hurricane.

25:20.482 --> 25:23.282
I am doing this
for those who will live.

25:23.284 --> 25:25.651
That's...
That's ridiculous.

25:31.993 --> 25:34.377
Oh, fuck!

25:35.830 --> 25:37.663
The health department
is here!

25:37.665 --> 25:41.334
- What if I did the dance and no singing?
- That's even worse.

25:41.336 --> 25:44.921
Jim, I'm just disappointed in you
that you don't understand this.

25:44.923 --> 25:46.839
The dance is ironic.

25:46.841 --> 25:50.093
It's a commentary on the failure
of our leaders to do anything.

25:50.095 --> 25:52.061
- It's meant...
- Oh, my God, Walter. Martin just texted.

25:52.063 --> 25:54.480
They've downgraded Hurricane
Gina to a Category 2.

25:54.482 --> 25:56.649
And Gardner
texted "Bring Blunt home."

25:56.651 --> 25:59.902
They're going with regular
Saturday night broadcasts.

25:59.904 --> 26:02.655
It can't be true.
My call to arms.

26:02.657 --> 26:05.441
The dance. Has the weather gone so mad

26:05.443 --> 26:07.860
that these storms
can no longer be relied on?

26:07.862 --> 26:11.197
You, campfire,
you're young. Run.

26:11.199 --> 26:13.583
Bring these condoms to Red.
The health department is here.

26:13.585 --> 26:16.002
Are you saying Harry
is not wearing a condom?

26:16.004 --> 26:17.954
Yes, that is what
I'm saying.

26:17.956 --> 26:19.756
Run, Jim, run!

26:31.386 --> 26:35.104
I'm sorry you didn't get to cause
a shift in consciousness, Major.

26:35.106 --> 26:36.439
Oh, that's all right,
Harry.

26:36.441 --> 26:38.724
There will be other
opportunities.

26:38.726 --> 26:43.529
I'm only sorry you didn't get to
consummate with that young lady.

26:45.116 --> 26:47.784
It wasn't meant
to be, sir.

26:47.786 --> 26:50.203
My life's pattern
held true.

26:50.205 --> 26:54.407
I experienced shame
and anticipated punishment.

26:54.409 --> 26:56.793
Well, I will pay
your fine

26:56.795 --> 26:59.829
and have your record
expunged.

26:59.831 --> 27:02.131
Thank you, sir.

27:03.585 --> 27:06.469
Now, what would you like
me to read to you tonight?

27:06.471 --> 27:08.337
We have The Once
and Future King,

27:08.339 --> 27:11.474
The Interpretation
of Dreams, and the Koran.

27:11.476 --> 27:14.010
Oh, God, still pushing
the Koran, Harry?

27:14.012 --> 27:17.230
Yes, Major. I think it's
important that you read it.

27:17.232 --> 27:18.564
I know, I know.

27:18.566 --> 27:21.767
And we will start
tomorrow, I promise.

27:21.769 --> 27:25.104
But tonight I want
only pleasure.

27:25.106 --> 27:28.274
I want The Once
and Future King.

27:28.276 --> 27:30.660
Very good, Major.

27:37.619 --> 27:41.204
"The governess was
always getting muddled"

27:41.206 --> 27:43.339
with her astrolabe.

27:43.341 --> 27:45.508
And when she got
specially muddled,

27:45.510 --> 27:47.677
she would take it out
on the Wart

27:47.679 --> 27:49.929
by rapping his knuckles.

27:49.931 --> 27:52.682
She did not rap
Kay's knuckles

27:52.684 --> 27:57.053
because when Kay grew
older, he would be Sir Kay,

27:57.055 --> 27:59.138
the master of the estate.

27:59.140 --> 28:02.024
The Wart was called
the Wart

28:02.026 --> 28:05.194
because it more or less
rhymed with Art,

28:05.196 --> 28:07.280
which was short
for his real name.

28:07.282 --> 28:09.982
Kay had given
him the nickname.

28:09.984 --> 28:12.685
Kay was not called
anything but Kay

28:12.687 --> 28:15.221
as he was too dignified
to have a nickname

28:15.223 --> 28:19.525
and would have flown into a passion
if anybody had tried to give him one.

28:20.862 --> 28:23.396
The governess
had red hair

28:23.398 --> 28:26.265
and some
mysterious wound

28:26.267 --> 28:29.168
from which she derived
a lot of prestige

28:29.170 --> 28:31.837
by showing it to all
the women of the castle

28:31.839 --> 28:34.240
behind closed doors."
