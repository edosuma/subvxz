00:00.969 --> 00:03.267
<i> I got nerve</i>

00:05.274 --> 00:07.299
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

00:07.376 --> 00:09.606
<i>I got nerve</i>

00:11.213 --> 00:13.613
Thanks for coming!
See you all next time!

00:13.682 --> 00:15.081
Hey, take it easy, people.

00:15.150 --> 00:17.584
She picks her nose
just like everybody else.

00:17.653 --> 00:21.214
- One nostril at a time.
- That is not true.

00:21.290 --> 00:24.282
Right, she has people do it for her.

00:24.359 --> 00:26.589
Hey, it was one time.

00:26.662 --> 00:29.631
My nails were wet and Lilly offered.

00:30.766 --> 00:33.291
Hey, Andy, don't bother
with switching the limos tonight.

00:33.368 --> 00:34.835
Nobody's following us.

00:34.903 --> 00:39.397
And the sooner I can stop breathing
the same air as my brother, the better.

00:40.909 --> 00:43.343
Lighten up. I'm just having a little fun.

00:43.412 --> 00:45.471
You'd feel the same way
if you had to sit backstage

00:45.547 --> 00:47.640
and listen to songs
you've heard a thousand times.

00:47.716 --> 00:50.810
- I get it, "You got nerve. "
- Yes, I do.

00:55.224 --> 00:58.318
- Hey, Miles, you got your keys on you?
- Who's taking care of who?

00:58.393 --> 01:00.657
Yeah, right, sorry.

01:02.264 --> 01:03.561
Bye.

01:04.967 --> 01:08.095
Jackson, very funny.
Come on, Jackson, let me in.

01:08.170 --> 01:10.798
- Jackson!
- Hey, Hannah!

01:10.873 --> 01:11.965
Got you!

01:12.040 --> 01:14.804
I knew if I kept following you,
I'd find out where you live.

01:14.877 --> 01:16.572
Live here? Me?

01:16.645 --> 01:19.170
No, I'm just here to visit a friend.

01:19.248 --> 01:22.479
- Looks more like a boyfriend to me.
- A what?

01:22.551 --> 01:24.382
Say "Front Page!"

01:26.000 --> 01:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:33.595 --> 01:35.028
<i> Come on!</i>

01:35.097 --> 01:39.090
<i>You get the limo out front</i>

01:39.167 --> 01:42.728
<i>Hottest styles, every shoe, every color</i>

01:42.804 --> 01:46.467
<i>Yeah, when you're famous</i>
<i>it can be kind of fun</i>

01:46.541 --> 01:51.501
<i>It's really you</i>
<i>but no one ever discovers</i>

01:51.580 --> 01:54.640
<i>Who would have thought</i>
<i>that a girl like me</i>

01:54.716 --> 02:00.211
<i>Would double as a superstar?</i>

02:00.289 --> 02:04.191
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

02:04.259 --> 02:06.227
<i>Chill it out, take it slow</i>

02:06.295 --> 02:07.922
<i>Then you rock out the show</i>

02:07.996 --> 02:12.296
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

02:12.367 --> 02:14.096
<i>Mix it all together</i>

02:14.169 --> 02:17.332
<i>And you know that</i>
<i>it's the best of both worlds</i>

02:22.711 --> 02:25.077
Go away!

02:26.615 --> 02:29.277
You guys wanna see something?
I'll show you a little something!

02:31.586 --> 02:32.951
Oh, great.

02:33.021 --> 02:36.718
I can see the next headline now.
"Hannah Dates Monkey Boy!"

02:36.792 --> 02:39.693
Hey, there wouldn't even be
any headlines if it wasn't for you.

02:39.761 --> 02:43.527
And there wouldn't be any picture
if you hadn't locked me out.

02:43.598 --> 02:47.364
Clear it! Out of my way!
This is my house! Get back!

02:47.436 --> 02:50.234
Hey, why don't y'all
go chase a crooked politician?

02:50.305 --> 02:52.535
At least he'll smile for you.

02:55.577 --> 02:59.638
So, when exactly were you two
gonna tell me you were dating?

02:59.715 --> 03:02.741
Come on, Dad, it's not funny.
It's horrible.

03:02.818 --> 03:06.083
Yeah, how could anybody believe that
I would go out with someone like her?

03:06.154 --> 03:08.213
Jackson, it would be
the luckiest day of your life

03:08.290 --> 03:09.484
if you got to date Hannah Montana.

03:09.558 --> 03:12.254
And what am I saying?

03:12.327 --> 03:14.818
Well, the two of you
do make a lovely couple.

03:14.896 --> 03:16.363
No!

03:16.431 --> 03:17.693
This is all your fault!

03:17.766 --> 03:22.135
"Don't bother switching the limos.
Nobody's following us. I am so smart. "

03:22.204 --> 03:23.831
Blah! Blah! Blah!

03:23.905 --> 03:26.999
- Is that true, Mile?
- Dad, please, no lectures.

03:27.075 --> 03:29.839
The entire world
now thinks I'm dating Jackson.

03:29.911 --> 03:31.606
Isn't that punishment enough?

03:31.680 --> 03:34.444
I'm afraid this time you're not gonna
able to joke your way out of this.

03:34.516 --> 03:36.006
Who's joking?

03:38.587 --> 03:40.714
Oh, great, just what I need.

03:41.890 --> 03:43.084
Hi, Traci.

03:43.158 --> 03:47.561
Hannah, I can't believe
you have a boyfriend and didn't tell me.

03:47.629 --> 03:49.995
And he's so cute.

03:50.065 --> 03:53.967
Yeah, he's really... something.

03:55.303 --> 03:57.362
You have to bring him to the party

03:57.439 --> 04:00.272
I'm throwing for Madonna
tomorrow afternoon.

04:00.342 --> 04:02.469
<i>Everyone's going to be there. </i>

04:02.544 --> 04:06.036
It's the perfect place
to show off Hannah's new hottie.

04:06.948 --> 04:12.409
Trace, I don't know how we
could pass up an opportunity like this.

04:12.487 --> 04:17.322
Of course me and my hottie
will be at your party.

04:17.392 --> 04:18.586
What?

04:19.894 --> 04:22.055
Fabu. Ciao.

04:24.132 --> 04:26.623
Will this nightmare never end?

04:26.701 --> 04:28.828
Not until the press
gets a picture of us breaking up.

04:28.904 --> 04:31.065
And that party
is the perfect place to do it.

04:31.139 --> 04:33.699
Look, I am not going
to some stupid celebrity party

04:33.775 --> 04:35.470
as Hannah's little show dog.

04:35.544 --> 04:36.943
Right, Dad?

04:37.779 --> 04:38.871
Dad?

04:40.382 --> 04:42.009
Oh, no, Dad! Why?

04:42.084 --> 04:44.678
Son, I know your sister
got herself into this pickle,

04:44.753 --> 04:47.278
but she's not gonna be able
to get out of it without your help.

04:47.355 --> 04:50.756
Now, you may not like it,
but that's what family does for family.

04:50.826 --> 04:51.918
All right, fine.

04:51.993 --> 04:55.190
But since you got me into this,
I get to break up with you.

04:55.263 --> 04:56.355
No way.

04:56.431 --> 05:00.197
I'm the teen pop sensation.
I get to break up with you. Right, Dad?

05:01.703 --> 05:02.795
Dad?

05:03.805 --> 05:05.796
Oh, no, Dad! Why?

05:10.912 --> 05:13.039
Boy, life sure can be weird.

05:14.116 --> 05:16.812
Who would have thought
Miley would be dating Jackson

05:16.885 --> 05:19.513
and you'd be burping a sack of flour.

05:20.989 --> 05:23.355
Oliver, the assignment
is to raise a fake baby.

05:23.425 --> 05:27.521
You don't get extra credit
for turning into Daddy McDork.

05:27.596 --> 05:30.463
Hey, when you take
Mr. Meyer's class next semester,

05:30.532 --> 05:33.524
you can handle the assignment
any way you want.

05:33.602 --> 05:36.435
- But I'm gonna take it seriously.
- Why?

05:37.439 --> 05:40.533
There's my little cuddle-wuddles.

05:40.609 --> 05:43.043
Mommy got you
some organic strained beets

05:43.111 --> 05:45.978
from a non-profit
Native American commune.

05:47.415 --> 05:48.780
Yummy!

05:48.850 --> 05:51.080
You missed it, Sarah, sweetheart.

05:51.853 --> 05:55.084
He just learned
how to sit up on his own.

05:55.157 --> 05:56.715
Good for you!

05:56.791 --> 05:58.656
It won't be long
until you're all grown up

05:58.727 --> 06:01.696
and making alternative fuel
out of raisins.

06:03.832 --> 06:08.166
So, that's what this is all about.

06:08.236 --> 06:10.033
- What?
- Nothing.

06:10.105 --> 06:15.372
It's just that you and Sarah
and your "flour child"

06:15.443 --> 06:17.911
make a very cute family.

06:18.513 --> 06:21.744
- Thank you.
- Oh, Lilly. You kidder.

06:21.816 --> 06:23.579
We're just friends
doing an assignment.

06:23.652 --> 06:25.483
Nothing more.

06:25.554 --> 06:28.182
Don't blow this for me.

06:28.256 --> 06:30.622
- I really like her.
- Since when?

06:32.027 --> 06:35.485
Since she became
the mother of my assignment.

06:35.564 --> 06:37.225
Look, I can't explain it.

06:37.299 --> 06:39.426
But the more time I spend with her,
the more I like her.

06:39.501 --> 06:42.026
Oliver, I'm worried.

06:42.103 --> 06:44.833
I think he looks a little pale.

06:44.906 --> 06:47.807
Of course he's pale,
he's bleached flour.

06:52.414 --> 06:55.281
Okay, so we're clear on the plan, right?

06:55.350 --> 06:56.749
We get in front of the press and I say,

06:56.818 --> 06:58.410
" Jackson, what are you
trying to say to me?"

06:58.486 --> 07:00.351
- And you say...
- "See you. Wouldn't wanna be you. "

07:00.422 --> 07:02.287
Now where's the free shrimp?

07:02.357 --> 07:04.757
Jackson, you're breaking up
with Hannah Montana.

07:04.826 --> 07:06.384
Can't you do it with a little more class?

07:07.529 --> 07:09.190
Apparently not.

07:09.297 --> 07:12.858
Look who came to wish you
a happy birthday, Madonna.

07:14.502 --> 07:16.902
America's new sweethearts.

07:16.972 --> 07:18.098
Madonna's a cat?

07:19.608 --> 07:22.702
I'm at a birthday party in a tent
for a cat.

07:24.112 --> 07:27.172
What's for dessert,
chocolate mousse or chocolate mouse?

07:27.249 --> 07:31.481
You're funny.
And he's even cuter in person.

07:32.087 --> 07:33.281
He is?

07:34.222 --> 07:38.420
I mean he is, of course, he is.
After all, he's my boyfriend.

07:40.528 --> 07:44.589
Impressive. Madonna's purring.

07:44.666 --> 07:46.827
Oh, wait, that's me.

07:49.738 --> 07:52.400
I smell something wrapped in bacon.

07:53.208 --> 07:54.402
What a caveman!

07:54.476 --> 07:57.343
You better be careful,
someone's going to steal him.

07:57.412 --> 07:59.039
Make me an offer.

07:59.981 --> 08:02.643
You're Hannah's new dude.

08:02.717 --> 08:05.709
- Awesome.
- Yeah, great, whatever.

08:06.855 --> 08:09.346
Hey, I'm Stavros. I'm dating Ashley.

08:09.424 --> 08:11.949
- Which Ashley?
- Like it matters.

08:18.199 --> 08:20.064
I got courtside seats
for the Lakers tomorrow night

08:20.135 --> 08:21.466
and Leonardo, he can't go.

08:21.536 --> 08:23.902
You wanna come?

08:23.972 --> 08:26.202
Do I have to pay for parking?

08:26.274 --> 08:29.368
Hey, you're one of us now.
We don't have to pay for anything.

08:29.444 --> 08:30.741
So, what do you mean?

08:30.812 --> 08:33.440
Dude, when you're in the public eye
as much as we are,

08:33.515 --> 08:36.643
companies give you stuff
just for the publicity.

08:37.419 --> 08:38.510
Here.

08:38.586 --> 08:39.813
Get your picture taken wearing these,

08:39.888 --> 08:41.913
you'll be getting
tons of glasses for free.

08:41.990 --> 08:43.251
Awesome.

08:44.993 --> 08:46.255
Oh, yeah.

08:49.497 --> 08:53.934
Look, Hannah, someone got Madonna
a rhinestone scooper.

08:55.270 --> 08:57.500
What a lucky kitty.

08:57.572 --> 08:59.836
- Where's the press?
- Don't worry.

08:59.908 --> 09:04.242
I knew you'd want your privacy,
so I kept the whole thing on the DL.

09:04.312 --> 09:06.212
Terrific.

09:06.281 --> 09:07.748
Isn't that woman
wearing the same dress as you?

09:09.084 --> 09:12.349
Oh, she has got to go.

09:12.420 --> 09:15.981
Security, escort my mother out!

09:21.730 --> 09:23.891
Yes, <i>This Week In Hollywood?</i>

09:23.965 --> 09:25.899
Hi, it's Traci Van Horne

09:25.967 --> 09:29.767
and you'll never guess
who's at my party.

09:29.838 --> 09:32.398
Hannah Montana and her new beau.

09:32.474 --> 09:33.566
That's right.

09:33.641 --> 09:37.543
And you better hurry. Ciao.

09:43.451 --> 09:45.510
Oliver, you've got to get your board.

09:45.587 --> 09:47.646
The waves are incredible today.

09:51.760 --> 09:53.660
How did I get so lucky?

09:54.896 --> 09:58.491
Everyone picked partners
and you were the only two left.

09:58.566 --> 10:00.796
Ollie-kins, where's the sunscreen?

10:00.869 --> 10:02.666
Now that they've destroyed
the ozone layer,

10:02.737 --> 10:05.831
we have to protect Little Ollie.

10:05.907 --> 10:07.306
Coming, Sarah-boo.

10:10.245 --> 10:13.305
Ollie-kins? Sarah-boo?

10:13.381 --> 10:16.612
I know. My cup runneth over.

10:21.856 --> 10:23.983
Oh, there you go.

10:25.160 --> 10:28.823
Just think, one day
he could be a great humanitarian.

10:29.831 --> 10:31.958
Or a couple dozen cupcakes.

10:38.106 --> 10:39.573
So, is he a good kisser?

10:40.775 --> 10:43.403
We haven't done that yet.

10:43.478 --> 10:46.504
We're taking it slow. Real slow.

10:47.715 --> 10:50.206
I'm talking centuries.

10:50.285 --> 10:52.185
Hannah, train wreck.

10:52.253 --> 10:54.585
Someone tipped off the press
that you were here.

10:54.656 --> 10:56.715
- No.
- I'm so embarrassed.

10:56.791 --> 11:00.818
- I'll sneak you out the back.
- No, that would ruin everything!

11:00.895 --> 11:05.798
I mean, if we don't face them now,
they'll never go away.

11:06.568 --> 11:09.264
You are so brave.

11:14.142 --> 11:15.541
Oh, yeah!

11:15.610 --> 11:17.771
Jackson, where've you been?

11:17.846 --> 11:20.337
Stavros just let me drive
his Vavetti Convertible.

11:20.415 --> 11:21.746
It was awesome!

11:21.816 --> 11:24.341
Hey, why don't you keep it
for the week?

11:24.419 --> 11:27.354
I got an SUV that needs some TLC.

11:27.422 --> 11:28.684
Oh, yeah!

11:32.193 --> 11:33.785
Honey.

11:33.862 --> 11:37.389
- Chicks. What?
- The press is here.

11:37.465 --> 11:39.456
So if there's anything
you would like to tell me,

11:39.534 --> 11:40.967
you should tell me now.

11:41.035 --> 11:43.435
- Oh, right.
- Come on, Jackson.

11:43.505 --> 11:46.372
- What do you have to say to me?
- I...

11:46.441 --> 11:48.875
Come on. I can handle it.

11:48.943 --> 11:50.934
Say something, monkey boy.

11:52.347 --> 11:56.249
I love you Hannah Montana
and I never want to break up with you.

11:56.317 --> 11:57.841
Never, ever!

12:00.555 --> 12:03.820
Well, aren't you full of surprises,
honey?

12:13.034 --> 12:18.097
- Come on, Miles. What's the big deal?
- Don't even talk to me!

12:18.172 --> 12:21.232
Sounds like you two are still a couple.

12:21.309 --> 12:23.174
Not just any couple!

12:23.244 --> 12:27.647
According to Jackson, we're
the happiest couple in Hollywood!

12:27.715 --> 12:29.012
Jackson, I'm gonna ask you a question

12:29.083 --> 12:31.677
I've never had to ask
one of my kids before.

12:31.753 --> 12:34.779
Why didn't you break up
with your sister?

12:34.856 --> 12:37.416
All right, look, I admit it.
I may have gotten a little carried away.

12:37.492 --> 12:40.518
But, Dad, some guy loaned me
his convertible for the week

12:40.595 --> 12:42.187
just because I'm Hannah's boyfriend.

12:42.263 --> 12:43.662
I don't care what the reason was,

12:43.731 --> 12:44.891
you were supposed
to help your sister...

12:44.966 --> 12:46.593
It's the Vavetti twin turbo.

12:46.668 --> 12:50.035
You and I are gonna take a long ride
and talk about it. I'll drive.

12:50.104 --> 12:51.332
Dad, what about me?

12:51.406 --> 12:54.739
Oh, honey, there's no backseat
and you've already had a ride.

12:54.809 --> 12:57.801
- Do you hear yourself?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

12:57.879 --> 13:01.542
Your daddy just had little bit
of a male moment there.

13:01.616 --> 13:03.140
Jackson, your sister's right.

13:03.217 --> 13:04.946
You can't take advantage
of her like this.

13:05.019 --> 13:08.079
She's the one that made me
her boyfriend in the first place.

13:08.156 --> 13:10.249
All I'm asking
is to keep pretending for, like,

13:10.325 --> 13:12.316
a week, so I can have a little fun with it.

13:12.393 --> 13:13.951
And you can't even give me that.

13:14.028 --> 13:18.192
- Good! We understand each other.
- Yeah, we do.

13:18.266 --> 13:20.734
When you need a favor from me,
that's family helping family.

13:20.802 --> 13:22.429
But when I ask
for a little something in return,

13:22.503 --> 13:25.028
well, suddenly
Hannah doesn't play that game.

13:25.907 --> 13:28.967
Nice to know
how things work around here!

13:32.246 --> 13:34.874
Don't worry, honey, he'll cool off.

13:34.949 --> 13:37.474
I know, it's just...

13:38.753 --> 13:39.879
What?

13:41.022 --> 13:44.287
Well, I did get him into this,
and he did help me out.

13:44.359 --> 13:46.452
And he never really gets the perks I get
when I'm Hannah.

13:46.527 --> 13:48.654
I mean, really, where's the harm?

13:48.730 --> 13:52.222
I don't know, but I'm sure
the two of you will find it.

13:53.368 --> 13:57.202
I can't believe I'm gonna say this,
but I think I have to do it.

13:57.271 --> 13:59.933
- One week. I can handle that.
Yes!

14:02.510 --> 14:05.343
You are the best girlfriend
I've ever had!

14:07.415 --> 14:09.747
This is weirder
than a three-eyed billy goat

14:09.817 --> 14:12.877
in a flat-bed truck
in the middle of Manhattan.

14:51.592 --> 14:53.617
Okay, Coop, I'll tell him.

14:54.562 --> 14:55.927
So, how was lunch with the boyfriend?

14:55.997 --> 14:57.897
- We didn't eat.
- Why not?

14:57.965 --> 15:00.627
No, no, no, you listen to me, Mr. Diddy.

15:01.936 --> 15:03.767
If you want us
to eat at your restaurant again,

15:03.838 --> 15:05.897
it's table one or nothing.

15:06.974 --> 15:09.738
Yeah, I don't even care
if you have to dump Bradgelina.

15:09.811 --> 15:12.974
You're dealing with Jacksannah now.

15:13.047 --> 15:15.675
Good day. I said good day, Diddy!

15:17.151 --> 15:20.609
- Answer your question?
- Hey, Jacksannah, Cooper called.

15:20.688 --> 15:22.121
Remember him, your best friend?

15:22.190 --> 15:25.785
Oh, right, I've been meaning
to get back to him.

15:25.860 --> 15:26.986
Note to self.

15:27.061 --> 15:31.054
Send Coop a nice fruit basket
saying I'm sorry, blah, blah, blah.

15:31.132 --> 15:34.590
And throw in an autographed photo
of Jacksannah.

15:34.669 --> 15:37.570
That's it! I've had it! Look at yourself!

15:37.638 --> 15:40.004
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

15:40.074 --> 15:42.508
And tomorrow on the
<i>Wake Up, It's Wendy!</i> show,

15:42.577 --> 15:46.343
I'm announcing
that " Jacksannah" is history.

15:46.414 --> 15:48.609
Hold on, you can't do that.
We had a deal.

15:48.683 --> 15:51.208
And if I'm not seen in public
wearing the sunglasses, the jacket,

15:51.285 --> 15:53.185
and the watch,
I'm gonna have to give them all back!

15:53.254 --> 15:55.154
I don't care!

15:55.223 --> 15:58.021
But the public doesn't want me,
they want us.

15:58.092 --> 16:00.686
I'm nothing without you.

16:00.762 --> 16:02.354
You complete me.

16:04.432 --> 16:07.026
And you completely creep me out!

16:07.101 --> 16:10.537
Okay, okay, okay, okay!
But what about family helping family?

16:10.605 --> 16:12.505
I tried to help you,

16:12.573 --> 16:15.804
but all it's done is turn you
into an obnoxious, self-centered jerk

16:15.877 --> 16:19.438
who took advantage of his sister
and blew off his best friend!

16:19.514 --> 16:21.778
Dude, it's over!

16:21.849 --> 16:23.476
Snoop Dorky Dork.

16:24.719 --> 16:27.517
Hey, hey, I did not blow him off!

16:27.588 --> 16:30.148
I'm sending him a nice fruit basket!

16:30.892 --> 16:31.916
Dad, talk to her.

16:36.097 --> 16:37.325
Dad!

16:41.269 --> 16:44.830
I am gonna send you a very
strongly worded text message.

16:49.410 --> 16:53.141
So, how about that A
we got on the baby project?

16:53.214 --> 16:54.408
Yeah.

16:55.483 --> 16:57.144
It's pretty great.

17:05.726 --> 17:06.818
- Did you say something?
- No.

17:06.894 --> 17:07.883
Oh.

17:18.472 --> 17:21.566
- I'm just gonna go stretch my legs.
- All right.

17:26.513 --> 17:28.482
She's suffocating me!

17:29.984 --> 17:34.011
Sarah? The love of your life?
The apple of your eye?

17:34.088 --> 17:36.079
The mother of your flour?

17:36.891 --> 17:39.917
That's just it. Without the kid
we have nothing to talk about.

17:39.994 --> 17:43.361
So tell her how you feel
and get it over with.

17:43.431 --> 17:47.561
Lilly, you don't understand,
I mean, that would break her heart.

17:47.635 --> 17:49.569
I'm her Big Daddy Oken!

17:50.504 --> 17:51.869
Big Daddy.

17:53.975 --> 17:54.999
I gotta be honest.

17:55.076 --> 17:56.703
Without the baby
we have nothing to talk about,

17:56.777 --> 18:00.804
you're boring and you use
petroleum-based hair products.

18:00.882 --> 18:02.474
It's over.

18:02.550 --> 18:03.949
Bye, Lilly!

18:06.387 --> 18:08.150
She's dying inside.

18:12.226 --> 18:14.786
<i>If we were a movie</i>

18:14.862 --> 18:17.092
<i>You'd be the right guy</i>

18:17.164 --> 18:19.598
<i>I'd be the best friend</i>

18:19.667 --> 18:21.828
<i>That you'd fall in love with</i>

18:21.903 --> 18:24.997
<i>In the end we'd be laughing</i>

18:25.072 --> 18:26.937
<i>Watching the sunset</i>

18:27.008 --> 18:29.442
<i>Fade to black, show the names</i>

18:29.510 --> 18:33.606
<i>Play that happy song</i>

18:36.550 --> 18:40.577
What a beautiful, beautiful song,
sung by a beautiful, beautiful girl.

18:42.356 --> 18:44.221
Take a look under your seats people.

18:44.292 --> 18:46.886
You've all got free
Hannah Montana goodie bags!

18:49.697 --> 18:51.892
So, Hannah.

18:51.966 --> 18:56.164
Whenever I hear a song
sung with that kind of emotion,

18:56.237 --> 19:00.606
I can't help thinking that you were
thinking of someone very special.

19:00.675 --> 19:02.472
Am I right? Am I right?
I'm right, aren't I?

19:04.378 --> 19:07.814
- Well, now that you bring it up...
- Yes.

19:07.882 --> 19:10.373
...I do have some news
about me and Jackson.

19:11.686 --> 19:14.553
No, no, no, it's not like that.
It's really kind of serious.

19:17.024 --> 19:20.084
The truth is, Jackson and I are...

19:20.161 --> 19:22.755
Totally and completely in love!

19:24.832 --> 19:27.960
Oh, no.
- I love Hannah Montana!

19:29.337 --> 19:31.965
I love Hannah Montana!

19:33.040 --> 19:36.908
I love Hannah Montana!

19:41.148 --> 19:46.211
Ladies and gentlemen,
the couple of the moment, Jacksannah!

19:47.922 --> 19:51.050
- What are you doing?
- I am trying to save this relationship!

19:51.125 --> 19:54.151
- What relationship?
- Don't say that, babe.

19:54.228 --> 19:56.196
I love this woman. I love this woman.

19:56.263 --> 19:59.323
I love her more than I love
my Grunschwiegenflagen watch!

19:59.400 --> 20:01.891
Water resistant to 150 meters.

20:01.969 --> 20:04.802
Wow, Hannah,
what do you have to say to that?

20:04.872 --> 20:06.931
- You wanna know what I'm gonna say?
- Yes, yes!

20:07.008 --> 20:08.805
Yes! Yes! Yes!

20:08.876 --> 20:10.776
You make me sick.

20:10.845 --> 20:12.369
I hate everything that you've become.

20:12.446 --> 20:14.437
We never should've started
this dating thing.

20:14.515 --> 20:18.076
It was one big, huge mistake,
but now it's over.

20:18.152 --> 20:20.177
No, no. No, I can change.

20:20.254 --> 20:22.188
Please, just give me another chance.

20:22.256 --> 20:24.053
I don't want to lose you
and all the things,

20:24.125 --> 20:27.356
Grunschwiegenflagen watch,
that we have together.

20:27.428 --> 20:31.091
Forget it. We have nothing together.
Jackson, it's over.

20:32.833 --> 20:35.301
Hannah, he's down on his knees.
How can you turn him down?

20:35.369 --> 20:36.666
Watch me.

20:37.772 --> 20:39.933
<i>If we were a movie</i>

20:40.007 --> 20:41.872
<i>I'd be the right guy</i>

20:41.942 --> 20:43.807
<i>That you'd fall in love with</i>

20:43.878 --> 20:46.346
Look at yourself. You're pathetic.

20:49.583 --> 20:52.245
No, stop, please!
You don't understand!

20:53.821 --> 20:55.652
Jackson! Jackson!
- Thanks a lot.

20:55.723 --> 20:58.055
Jackson! Jackson! Jackson!

20:58.125 --> 21:00.821
- Wait. Hold on, everybody.
- Jackson! Jackson!

21:00.895 --> 21:03.227
I've got something I gotta say.

21:04.098 --> 21:07.192
Hannah's not the bad guy here. I am.

21:08.636 --> 21:11.400
I just... I wanted a taste of the good life

21:11.472 --> 21:15.067
and Hannah pretended
to go out with me so I could get it.

21:15.976 --> 21:19.844
The truth is,
there never really was a Jacksannah.

21:21.449 --> 21:24.850
So you're saying
all of this was pretend?

21:24.919 --> 21:26.648
No, not all of it.

21:26.720 --> 21:30.520
I do love Hannah, but more like a sister.

21:31.725 --> 21:34.819
And I was hoping
that we could get back to that.

21:36.297 --> 21:37.992
I really am sorry.

21:41.235 --> 21:42.463
Okay.

21:45.239 --> 21:46.638
Hug, hug.

21:46.707 --> 21:51.303
Hug! Hug! Hug! Hug! Hug! Hug!
Hug! Hug! Hug! Hug! Hug! Hug!

21:51.378 --> 21:53.903
Stop pointing at the watch.
- Sorry.
