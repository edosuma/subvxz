16:13.765 --> 16:15.390
All right, Jim?

16:16.768 --> 16:19.102
- Anything you fancy?
- Nothing there.

16:19.270 --> 16:21.438
- I see you found a bird.
- I know her.

16:23.608 --> 16:26.818
Here, that's mine, ain't it?
Can I have that one? Ta.

16:39.540 --> 16:42.376
Here, Dan,
you seen what's goin' on in there?

16:42.543 --> 16:44.961
Go in there, it's a laugh.
You'll love it.

16:48.383 --> 16:49.925
Cheers.

17:36.097 --> 17:38.682
- Penny for your thoughts.
- Oh, let's have some.

17:38.850 --> 17:40.809
Come on, Monkey, don't mess about.

17:40.977 --> 17:43.478
Not unless you give me something first.

17:43.646 --> 17:44.813
What?

17:46.357 --> 17:48.859
You always have to ask, don't you?

18:01.330 --> 18:04.332
One, two, three for you.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.085
- Where'd you get these?
- That'd be telling.

18:07.712 --> 18:10.505
You forgot I work for a chemist.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.902
Oi!

19:14.070 --> 19:16.404
- What's going on?
- Come on, then.

19:19.534 --> 19:21.451
Come on, let's go.

24:35.349 --> 24:38.518
- Take that to Mr Phelps.
- Mr Phelps, eh.

24:44.692 --> 24:46.401
- Here y'are...
- You're late.

24:46.569 --> 24:48.444
The letters.

25:17.600 --> 25:19.517
Saw the rushes today, Michael.

25:19.727 --> 25:23.980
- The "people like you" film. And?
- I'd like you to look at them.

25:24.148 --> 25:27.692
- Sure. What's the problem?
- The overall campaign's going well.

25:29.862 --> 25:32.488
- Seen the posters?
- Yes. Gorgeous tart.

25:38.370 --> 25:41.206
The trouble is the clients
are getting over-greedy.

25:41.373 --> 25:42.624
As usual.

25:42.791 --> 25:45.210
They want to corner
the entire youth market.

25:45.377 --> 25:47.921
Cut right across the groupings.

25:48.088 --> 25:50.089
Well, it's all right with As and Bs.

25:50.257 --> 25:55.178
Training professionals, young managers,
graduates, that type of person.

25:57.348 --> 25:59.432
It's Cs and Ds I'm worried about.

26:00.893 --> 26:03.186
A little bit upmarket for them.

26:03.354 --> 26:05.772
I'll have a look at it for you,
with pleasure.

26:05.940 --> 26:07.482
- 2.30 all right?
- Fine.

26:07.691 --> 26:11.277
You don't think this talk of lung cancer
will make any difference?

26:11.445 --> 26:13.529
Oh, no. Young people like it.

26:13.697 --> 26:17.492
They don't worry about that sort of
thing. Glad I gave it up when I did.

26:23.165 --> 26:26.000
Psychopathic, that's what it was.
Making me feel...

26:26.168 --> 26:28.670
Shut up, both of you, and listen to me.

26:29.463 --> 26:33.007
Your next assignment is to get
that swine Sir Thomas Weller.

26:33.175 --> 26:37.428
Weller? Why him?
Are you bonkers? He's the guv, ain't he?

26:37.596 --> 26:39.472
Not any longer...

26:42.476 --> 26:44.560
Where you been?

26:45.771 --> 26:49.274
Fell asleep on the train.
I wound up in bloody Neasden.

26:49.441 --> 26:54.529
Running about on motorbikes all night,
I'm not surprised. It's not normal.

26:54.697 --> 26:57.407
In the middle of
a nice, quiet piece of scenery

26:57.574 --> 26:59.075
and kick him to a pulp.

26:59.243 --> 27:01.744
Oh, yeah? What's normal, then?

27:04.456 --> 27:07.166
Let me do it.
I've got some new boots I can try out.

27:07.334 --> 27:09.377
What's that?

27:10.546 --> 27:13.881
Tonight, I want you to do
a little job for me personally.

27:35.070 --> 27:36.863
Hello, Jim.

27:38.532 --> 27:40.575
Thought I'd just pop by, like.

27:41.368 --> 27:44.162
- You don't mind, do you?
- No, I don't mind. Come in.

27:44.330 --> 27:45.621
Cheers.

27:46.457 --> 27:49.584
- What's the matter, then?
- She's misfiring a bit.

27:50.044 --> 27:51.127
Yeah?

27:52.921 --> 27:55.798
It's your plug.
Got some tools on the bike. Hold up.

27:55.966 --> 27:58.009
I'll go and have a look.

28:02.765 --> 28:04.307
Gis a go at this.

28:06.560 --> 28:10.355
You'll break your leg off that.
No wonder you wear them big boots.

28:10.522 --> 28:12.982
That's the best bike ever made, mate.

28:13.150 --> 28:15.777
I got a ton-five out of that
the other day.

28:15.944 --> 28:18.154
- Sure.
- Better than that poxy hairdryer.

28:18.322 --> 28:20.073
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

28:21.617 --> 28:23.368
Well, that isn't it, is it?

28:23.535 --> 28:27.121
I mean, it isn't the bikes, is it?
It's the people.

28:27.289 --> 28:30.625
And the people who ride these
are states, third-class tickets.

28:30.793 --> 28:32.835
- Do what?
- Well, rockers.

28:33.003 --> 28:36.214
All that greasy hair and dirty clobber.
It's diabolical.

28:36.382 --> 28:39.759
I don't give a monkey's arsehole
about mods and rockers.

28:40.511 --> 28:42.637
Underneath, we're all the same.

28:42.805 --> 28:46.849
Nah, Kev, that's it: I don't want to be
the same as everybody else.

28:47.643 --> 28:51.771
That's why I'm a mod, see. I mean,
you gotta be somebody, ain't you?

28:51.939 --> 28:54.816
Or you might as well jump in the sea
and drown.

28:54.983 --> 28:57.110
That's why I joined the army.

28:57.277 --> 29:00.446
To be different.
To get away from all this.

29:01.115 --> 29:02.615
Don't matter where you go,

29:02.783 --> 29:05.535
there's always some cunt
who wants to push you about.

29:05.702 --> 29:07.036
Run it, please.

29:11.542 --> 29:13.042
Two bob.

29:15.421 --> 29:17.463
I'll see you.

29:18.340 --> 29:21.717
- Three fours.
- No, no, that's bollocks.

29:21.885 --> 29:24.887
- Three of a kind don't beat that.
- It bloody well does!

29:25.055 --> 29:27.014
- Who says?
- I do.

29:27.182 --> 29:29.225
He's right, you know, Harry.

29:38.235 --> 29:40.153
Will you run it, please?

29:43.198 --> 29:44.907
Your deal, Des.

29:54.418 --> 29:56.377
I was late.

29:57.504 --> 30:00.798
She was waiting.
In the wrong place.

30:02.176 --> 30:04.260
And by the time I found her...

30:04.470 --> 30:07.430
Could you get us some of those
French blues, then?

30:07.598 --> 30:09.974
I'll have to see, won't I? I dunno.

30:10.934 --> 30:12.393
You in?

30:16.315 --> 30:18.983
One card. Down and dirty.

30:20.110 --> 30:22.487
Make a mod out of you yet, Harry, eh?

30:22.654 --> 30:25.448
I don't think, though,
they make Levis in your size.

30:25.657 --> 30:26.949
Bollocks.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.246
You and me.

30:33.624 --> 30:35.833
- All right, I'll go.
- Three.

30:39.671 --> 30:42.215
- Two bob.
- For people like you.

30:42.799 --> 30:44.342
- I'm out.
- So am I.

30:44.510 --> 30:47.053
You are a fucking jammy bleeder, Cooper.

30:47.221 --> 30:50.348
You're getting chicken, Des.
Look, I only had an ace.

30:53.101 --> 30:55.436
I gotta go off to Broadwick Street now.

30:56.063 --> 30:59.273
- Take some stuff up there.
- Run that film again, please.

30:59.441 --> 31:01.025
Shall we get out?

31:05.239 --> 31:09.200
Oh, yeah, Des, I don't like to be cruel.
Here y'are, take it all back.

31:09.910 --> 31:11.994
It's yours, you won it.

31:12.162 --> 31:14.705
That's the ten bob I owe you.

31:14.873 --> 31:18.251
Fuck off, I ain't carrying
all that fucking change about.

31:18.418 --> 31:20.503
You take it or leave it, me son.

31:20.671 --> 31:22.838
Take it or leave it.

31:23.006 --> 31:25.591
I'll see you later, Harry. See you, Des.

31:41.608 --> 31:44.986
Mr Cale sent me up to collect
some stuff for Broadwick Street.

31:45.153 --> 31:49.031
Yes. I've been waiting for you
for over an hour.

31:49.199 --> 31:50.449
Yeah.

31:54.037 --> 31:57.206
Come on, hurry up.
That stuff's got to be over there fast.

31:57.374 --> 31:59.208
F-A-S-T.

32:00.919 --> 32:03.004
Watch the cloth, moth.

32:03.171 --> 32:05.464
What a tacky Herbert.

32:08.468 --> 32:10.886
- Do you wanna hear it?
- Yeah.

32:11.054 --> 32:12.805
Number two.

32:51.595 --> 32:54.513
- Oh, boy.
- What you gonna do tonight, then?

32:54.681 --> 32:56.599
Wait for a phone call, I suppose.

32:57.684 --> 33:00.102
- I'll see you later, all right?
- Bye.

33:02.022 --> 33:04.732
Wotcha, Jimmy.
What you doing here, then?

33:04.900 --> 33:07.276
- I was waiting for you.
- Yeah? What for?

33:07.444 --> 33:09.862
- I thought I'd give you a lift home.
- Great.

33:10.030 --> 33:11.697
- Steph?
- What?

33:11.865 --> 33:14.533
- You goin' to Brighton this weekend?
- Yeah. You?

33:14.701 --> 33:17.203
'Course I am. Who are you going with?

33:17.371 --> 33:20.122
Pete's taking me.
It's gonna be good, innit?

33:20.290 --> 33:22.583
Yeah. Good.

33:23.168 --> 33:25.544
You and Pete getting a bit strong, then?

33:25.712 --> 33:28.589
Nah, 'course not.
He's a laugh, that's all.

33:29.716 --> 33:31.384
Bit flash, though, ain't he?

33:31.551 --> 33:33.844
I wouldn't be with him otherwise,
would I?

33:34.012 --> 33:35.304
Nah.

33:35.472 --> 33:37.723
- Suppose not.
- Hey, you jealous?

33:37.891 --> 33:39.934
- 'Course I ain't.
- Nah?

33:40.727 --> 33:42.812
That's a pity, I thought you was.

33:55.492 --> 33:57.660
- It's the technique.
- All right, boys?

33:59.162 --> 34:00.996
What are we gonna do about pills?

34:01.164 --> 34:04.208
If we're going to Brighton,
we're gonna need millions.

34:04.376 --> 34:06.377
I wanna get out of me head for a start.

34:06.545 --> 34:09.630
Wouldn't be too difficult
with your little monkey brain.

34:09.797 --> 34:13.342
Get some rockers out their heads
when we're there, knock 'em off.

34:13.510 --> 34:17.138
- I was thinking about getting a gun.
- Don't talk bloody daft.

34:17.304 --> 34:19.223
Here, I get my suit tomorrow.

34:19.391 --> 34:21.516
Only 'cause
you wanna screw Steph, innit?

34:21.726 --> 34:23.018
Jim!

34:23.186 --> 34:26.647
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

34:31.110 --> 34:33.446
- Get off.
- Get outside.

34:33.612 --> 34:35.572
- We're goin', aren't we?
- Let's go.

34:35.741 --> 34:37.658
Let's go up the Goldhawk, lads.

34:38.452 --> 34:41.203
Look, tomato sauce.
It's all watered down.

34:41.371 --> 34:43.914
The rolls have got scabs on 'em.

35:15.155 --> 35:16.238
Shit.

35:22.704 --> 35:24.914
- Get off it a sec.
- Spider!

35:25.081 --> 35:26.707
Here, look, lads.

35:28.627 --> 35:30.294
- What's up, then?
- Dunno.

35:30.462 --> 35:33.005
- Break down?
- Must be, the brakes are down.

35:33.173 --> 35:35.925
- We'll see you down there, then.
- Ten minutes.

35:36.092 --> 35:39.428
- You'd be better catching a bus!
- We will, then.

35:52.943 --> 35:54.985
- Shit.
- What's the matter with it?

35:55.195 --> 35:57.655
How am I supposed to know
what the matter is?

36:16.341 --> 36:18.092
Oh, shit.

36:20.637 --> 36:23.597
What's the matter?
Your mother's hairdryer blown up?

36:23.807 --> 36:26.809
- Rubber band busted?
- Yeah. Let's fix it.

36:26.977 --> 36:28.269
Let's fix it.

36:28.436 --> 36:30.980
Hold on,
we don't do nothin' for nothin'.

36:31.147 --> 36:34.316
Look, why don't you piss off?
Bloody leave us alone.

36:34.901 --> 36:37.403
Hold on, Lenny,
they don't want our help.

36:37.946 --> 36:41.866
Which one are you? The boy or the girl?
It's hard to tell with you lot.

36:42.033 --> 36:44.201
This one's a bird. Give us a kiss.

36:44.369 --> 36:45.828
Piss off, all right?

36:45.996 --> 36:47.538
Bastards!

36:50.417 --> 36:52.960
This one's the bird!
She got tits!

36:53.378 --> 36:55.671
Let go!

36:55.839 --> 36:57.840
- Spider!
- OK, let's go!

36:58.008 --> 37:00.092
Spider!

37:00.552 --> 37:02.636
So long, sucker!

37:02.846 --> 37:04.513
Fuck off!

37:05.682 --> 37:07.766
Bloody hell.

37:21.114 --> 37:23.866
I've just seen Spider.
He's taken a right kicking.

37:24.034 --> 37:25.951
- What?
- Some rockers have had him.

37:26.119 --> 37:27.536
- He's outside.
- Where?

37:27.704 --> 37:29.830
On the stairs. Come on.

37:31.791 --> 37:33.918
Spider, you all right, yeah?

37:34.085 --> 37:37.171
What's this about rockers
kicking your head in?

37:37.339 --> 37:39.882
- Gonna murder the bastards!
- You lot, come on!

37:40.050 --> 37:42.217
- Come on!
- You stay there, right?

37:42.385 --> 37:44.803
- What are we gonna do?
- Fucking kill 'em!

37:44.971 --> 37:47.097
Right. Are you with me?

37:47.265 --> 37:49.725
- I'm with you.
- They're all going to meet death!

37:50.477 --> 37:52.978
We're gonna fuckin' murder! Murder!

38:49.619 --> 38:51.620
There they fucking are!

39:07.053 --> 39:08.220
Christ!

39:23.486 --> 39:25.029
Fuckin' hell!

39:25.238 --> 39:27.531
'Ave him! Fuckin' 'ave him!

39:29.075 --> 39:30.743
Fucking greaser!

39:31.494 --> 39:32.578
Jim!

39:32.746 --> 39:34.830
You wanted it, didn't you?

39:36.166 --> 39:38.709
No, no, fuck off! Leave him alone!

39:39.335 --> 39:41.378
No, leave him alone!

39:48.178 --> 39:50.012
Where's he going?

39:53.600 --> 39:55.517
All right, run!

39:55.685 --> 39:57.811
- Leg it!
- The fuckin' law will be here!

40:36.601 --> 40:40.229
- What time do you call this?
- I don't know, I haven't got a watch.

40:40.396 --> 40:43.148
Don't come funny, lad.
It's nearly midnight.

40:43.316 --> 40:46.235
Don't worry, I ain't gonna turn
into a pumpkin, am I?

40:46.402 --> 40:48.403
Anyway, you're pissed.

40:48.905 --> 40:51.031
George, what's going on?

40:51.199 --> 40:52.366
Cunt.

40:53.701 --> 40:56.745
I've been sitting up for
more than an hour waiting for you.

40:56.913 --> 40:59.498
- I can do without your clever remarks.
- George.

40:59.707 --> 41:03.085
- Who do you think you are?
- I don't know. You tell me, eh?

41:04.003 --> 41:06.839
You're barmy, you are,
staying out all hours.

41:07.048 --> 41:10.467
Getting up to God-knows-what,
dressing up like a freak.

41:11.427 --> 41:13.720
Stand still when I'm talking to you.

41:13.888 --> 41:16.682
Wouldn't be at all surprised
if you're not on drugs.

41:16.850 --> 41:20.018
I know what you get up to
down that club, you and your mates.

41:20.186 --> 41:24.439
You've gotta be part of a gang, haven't
you? Gotta be a mod, or this, or that.

41:24.607 --> 41:26.775
Haven't you got a mind of your own?

41:26.943 --> 41:30.571
I'll tell you what's wrong with you.
You're schizophrenic.

41:30.738 --> 41:32.781
- What's that, then?
- I'll tell you.

41:32.991 --> 41:37.077
Somebody, like you, who doesn't know
if his mind's over here or over there.

41:37.245 --> 41:39.121
Bloody split personality.

41:41.457 --> 41:43.917
Half your mother's family were the same.

41:44.085 --> 41:46.253
I suppose that's where you get it.

41:46.421 --> 41:49.423
Your Uncle Sid
was always trying to kill himself.

41:49.591 --> 41:51.842
And when he did,
it was a bloody accident.

41:52.010 --> 41:54.803
He never knew if he was coming or going.
Bit like you.

41:54.971 --> 41:58.265
- What happened to him, then?
- He got drowned, didn't he?

41:58.433 --> 42:00.809
Fell down a bleedin' well in the garden.

42:03.479 --> 42:05.647
Go on, get off to bed.

43:21.099 --> 43:22.516
Jimmy?

43:22.684 --> 43:24.518
Jimmy!

43:25.520 --> 43:27.771
Come on, you. You're late as it is.

43:32.610 --> 43:33.902
- Jimmy!
- Don't.

43:34.070 --> 43:36.154
Come on, wake up!

43:43.246 --> 43:44.913
- I'm not well, Mum.
- What?

43:45.081 --> 43:47.291
I can't go to work, I'm not well.

43:47.458 --> 43:50.502
Oh.
Something wrong with your head, is it?

43:50.670 --> 43:54.214
Look at you, lying there
in all your clothes. It's not normal.

43:54.882 --> 43:57.259
I can't stand here. I've gotta get on.

43:57.760 --> 44:01.555
You make sure you go to the doctor
and get a certificate. You hear?

44:01.723 --> 44:02.889
Yes.

44:19.032 --> 44:22.451
Hang on, what about them blokes
Pete's always on about?

44:22.618 --> 44:24.745
What, always got bags of it?

44:24.912 --> 44:28.206
Straight out the back door
of the chemical factory?

44:28.374 --> 44:30.459
It's fucking rubbish.

44:30.626 --> 44:33.337
Sort of bollocks you expect
from that flash cunt.

44:33.504 --> 44:36.340
It's worth a try, though, innit?
I'm gonna pop...

44:36.507 --> 44:40.469
- It's not like you got no work to do.
- All right, George, half a minute.

44:40.636 --> 44:43.722
- I'll pick you up later, all right?
- Yeah, all right.

44:48.311 --> 44:49.978
Do you want a push start?

44:50.855 --> 44:52.481
No, thanks.

44:58.654 --> 45:01.823
Hey, Jim, I'll be on me own bike again
tomorrow, won't I?

45:01.991 --> 45:04.576
I'm getting the scooter back.

45:04.744 --> 45:08.455
- Burn the arse of your rust bucket.
- Any time.

45:28.518 --> 45:30.727
Butch! Jenny! It's all right.

45:30.895 --> 45:32.979
Go on, get back in there.

45:34.732 --> 45:36.858
All right, young Jim. On holiday?

45:37.026 --> 45:39.945
Nah. Just fancied the day off.

45:40.113 --> 45:42.531
You'll be getting like them beatniks.

45:42.698 --> 45:45.325
Ban the bomb
and do fuck all for a living.

45:45.493 --> 45:48.870
You're all right, ain't you?
Just you and your Uncle Charlie.

45:49.038 --> 45:51.998
You don't have to bother
with a load of cunts like I do.

45:52.166 --> 45:54.626
- Well, you know what I mean.
- No, I don't.

45:54.794 --> 45:58.380
If you don't work, you don't get
no money. And I like money.

45:59.215 --> 46:01.508
Pete, what about Brighton this weekend?

46:01.676 --> 46:03.677
What about it?

46:03.845 --> 46:07.514
Pills. Me and Dave thought
you might be able to get hold of some.

46:07.682 --> 46:10.016
Why me? I'm not a fucking pusher.

46:10.184 --> 46:12.978
No, no. But you know some blokes
who are, don't you?

46:13.146 --> 46:15.230
Not me. Charlie's mates.

46:15.440 --> 46:19.693
And I'm not about to start blabbing me
mouth off about mates of Charlie's.

46:19.861 --> 46:23.405
They're fucking big, these blokes.
They don't mess about.

46:24.073 --> 46:26.700
Anyway,
I don't know why you're worrying.

46:26.909 --> 46:29.744
- Ferdy'll have some.
- Ferdy ain't been seen, has he?

46:29.912 --> 46:34.166
He'll turn up. You watch, Friday night
he'll pop up like a jack-in-the-box.

46:34.959 --> 46:36.585
Or a golliwog.

46:41.466 --> 46:43.341
Ain't bloody here, is he?

46:43.509 --> 46:45.760
Cunt. I wonder where he is.

46:45.928 --> 46:49.055
- I don't know.
- This place gives me the shits.

46:50.057 --> 46:52.517
- Bleedin' nig-nogs everywhere.
- Shut up.

46:52.685 --> 46:54.936
It's like bleedin' Calcutta round here.

46:55.104 --> 46:57.189
Calcutta's in India.

46:57.356 --> 47:00.192
West India,
that's where they bleedin' come from.

47:02.445 --> 47:04.571
What's so funny?

47:10.453 --> 47:13.622
- Just who are you looking for?
- Is Ferdy in?

47:13.789 --> 47:15.916
He not here. Him gone out.

47:16.083 --> 47:17.918
Thank you.

47:19.420 --> 47:21.505
- Looking for Ferdy.
- Yeah.

47:21.672 --> 47:22.756
Yeah, yeah.

47:22.965 --> 47:24.466
He's gone out.

47:24.675 --> 47:26.760
Oh... yeah.

47:28.471 --> 47:31.765
Stitchin' me up and all, the bloke.
Fucking...

47:31.974 --> 47:33.808
Peter Fenton?

47:34.977 --> 47:37.062
Peter!

47:38.814 --> 47:39.814
Thanks.

47:41.275 --> 47:43.360
Hello, Peter Fenton. Who is it?

47:44.695 --> 47:48.740
- What d'you wanna ring me up here for?
- Listen, you cunt,

47:48.908 --> 47:52.494
tell us where we can find these blokes
or we're stuck for Brighton.

47:52.662 --> 47:54.371
Yeah, OK. This time.

48:21.941 --> 48:24.025
- Hold this, then.
- What for?

48:24.193 --> 48:26.611
I ain't going in there with me parka on,
am I?

48:32.535 --> 48:34.035
Hey, Jim.

48:44.880 --> 48:46.464
Excuse me.

48:50.720 --> 48:54.222
- What d'you want, son?
- Is Harry North about?

48:54.390 --> 48:57.100
- Who are you, then?
- I've got a message for him.

48:57.893 --> 48:59.978
Hang about a minute, all right?

49:12.241 --> 49:14.492
Come through here. Come through.

49:14.660 --> 49:16.328
Come through.

49:17.079 --> 49:18.913
Over there.

49:19.081 --> 49:21.041
Through here.

49:32.470 --> 49:34.596
That's him over there in the grey suit.

49:34.764 --> 49:36.890
Go on, you're all right. Go on.

49:41.437 --> 49:43.521
What can I do for you, son?

49:43.689 --> 49:45.273
- Me Uncle Charlie.
- Who?

49:45.483 --> 49:47.275
Charlie Fenton, he said...

49:48.944 --> 49:51.988
- Are you Charlie's boy?
- His nephew, yeah.

49:52.156 --> 49:54.324
Oh, his nephew. What's your name, son?

49:54.492 --> 49:56.117
Jimmy.

49:56.285 --> 49:59.829
It's a pleasure and a privilege
to meet any one of the Fentons.

49:59.997 --> 50:02.457
- Now, do you want a drink, son?
- No, thanks.

50:02.625 --> 50:05.293
- I gotta get going soon.
- What can I do for you?

50:07.630 --> 50:10.215
Listen, you can have a talk here.
We're all pals.

50:10.383 --> 50:13.301
- I wanted some pills.
- Oh.

50:13.469 --> 50:16.930
What do you want?
Purple hearts? Blues? Dexedrine?

50:17.139 --> 50:19.933
Some blues. I've got a tenner.

50:20.101 --> 50:21.976
No, not here, son.

50:23.062 --> 50:25.146
Teddy, come here.

50:27.274 --> 50:31.069
This is Teddy. Go for a walk with him
and he'll do the business for you.

50:31.237 --> 50:34.989
- All right.
- Give my regards to your Uncle Charlie.

50:36.409 --> 50:37.909
Pillhead.

50:38.077 --> 50:40.161
Come on, Ronnie.

50:40.705 --> 50:42.330
Come on, Ron!

50:43.290 --> 50:45.083
Tosser.

50:48.379 --> 50:49.671
Chalk...

51:03.894 --> 51:06.020
It's all there.

51:16.407 --> 51:19.868
250 leapers! This'll see us through
till Christmas, eh?

51:20.035 --> 51:23.288
- Show me.
- One for the road, eh?

51:23.748 --> 51:25.874
Come on, hurry up.

51:26.542 --> 51:29.294
That ain't a blue! That's paraffin.

51:31.172 --> 51:34.048
We've been done,
that's my three quid down the drain.

51:34.216 --> 51:35.925
Yeah, and mine!

51:36.886 --> 51:39.137
Let's do the bastard's motor.

51:39.346 --> 51:40.764
Come on.

51:44.643 --> 51:46.102
Get out the way!

51:47.521 --> 51:49.355
Come on! Go!

51:52.026 --> 51:53.651
You on?

51:55.696 --> 51:57.655
Wankers!

52:15.049 --> 52:16.341
Nice.

52:16.759 --> 52:20.094
Give it a shove. Go on, shove it, man.

52:21.680 --> 52:24.140
Nice one.
You're fucking making a racket.

52:24.308 --> 52:26.893
- Do we have to do this?
- Course we do.

52:27.061 --> 52:29.979
We don't wanna leave fingerprints
all over the gaff.

52:30.147 --> 52:31.940
They'll catch us on the smell.

52:33.859 --> 52:35.401
Shut up.

52:43.911 --> 52:46.454
We must be able to find some blues here.

52:46.914 --> 52:48.957
Look at that.

52:49.834 --> 52:51.084
Oh, yes.

52:54.630 --> 52:56.464
- Dave.
- What?

52:56.632 --> 52:58.091
Come here.

53:06.058 --> 53:07.308
Shut up!

53:07.768 --> 53:10.144
- Fucking shut up!
- All right.

53:13.440 --> 53:15.149
This place...

53:17.319 --> 53:19.946
- Here, Jim, I just had a thought.
- What?

53:20.114 --> 53:22.031
- Footprints.
- Footprints. What?

53:22.199 --> 53:24.742
You got lines on the back of your feet.

53:24.910 --> 53:27.036
There must be thousands of pills here.

53:27.204 --> 53:28.705
Or millions.

53:29.748 --> 53:32.959
Nothing's there.
I'm gonna search in there.

53:33.127 --> 53:35.837
I'm putting me socks on. I ain't stupid.

53:41.093 --> 53:42.552
Police!

53:50.936 --> 53:52.645
Hey, lads, look at these.

53:52.855 --> 53:56.024
- Johnnies, hundreds of 'em.
- Chuck us a couple of packets.

53:56.191 --> 53:59.193
- Got something planned for tonight?
- 'Course I have.

54:19.715 --> 54:22.759
Oh! Fucking yellows.

54:22.968 --> 54:25.553
Chalky, what you doing?
Come and give us a hand.

54:25.721 --> 54:27.805
Not taking no chances, am I?

54:29.516 --> 54:33.519
Come on, shut up.
Let's get down to it, eh?

54:39.401 --> 54:42.487
I've found 'em. They're blues.

54:43.072 --> 54:45.239
- I found some blues.
- There's not many.

54:46.742 --> 54:49.494
- Perhaps someone's been nickin' 'em.
- Fucking hell!

54:52.373 --> 54:54.082
Hang on!

54:54.249 --> 54:56.334
Chalky, come on.

54:56.502 --> 54:58.544
Just getting something for me mum.

55:00.089 --> 55:02.507
- I'm dropping all the blues.
- Just get out.

55:14.436 --> 55:16.562
- All right.
- One and tuppence.

55:16.772 --> 55:19.399
OK. And you behave yourself tonight.

55:19.566 --> 55:22.360
I'll try.
I'll try and behave myself tonight.

55:23.445 --> 55:25.822
I'm flying. Terrific, ain't they?

55:25.990 --> 55:29.283
- Did we have it off, or what?

55:29.785 --> 55:32.161

- You didn't.

55:32.329 --> 55:33.579
I was gonna phone you.

55:33.789 --> 55:36.749
Why didn't you?
I coulda told you where everything was.

55:36.917 --> 55:39.168
Got you a Pepsi.

55:39.336 --> 55:41.045
- And a present.
- What is it?

55:41.213 --> 55:44.966
- You nicked 'em, didn't you?
- You are now handling stolen goods.

55:45.134 --> 55:47.135
Here y'are, I'll give you some more.

55:50.848 --> 55:53.391

56:05.404 --> 56:07.363
What about Pete, then?

56:07.531 --> 56:09.657
I'll worry about Pete.

56:09.825 --> 56:14.495
But if you tell him, I will never, ever
speak to you again, right?

56:18.000 --> 56:20.251
Don't worry, I won't tell him.

56:21.920 --> 56:24.672
And I'm still gonna go down
to Brighton with him.

56:24.840 --> 56:27.175
- Yeah.
- I've said I would, haven't I?

Mr Fulford had a few words to say about
your unexplained absence yesterday.

57:06.048 --> 57:08.966
- Like what?
- Like don't do it again.

57:09.134 --> 57:13.638
Unless you want to end up hearing him
read the riot act. I take it you don't.

No, I'd rather be dead, Mr Cale.

It's just the front
I'm a bit dodgy about.

57:36.703 --> 57:39.038
The only way to keep that up
is with lacquer.

57:39.206 --> 57:41.499
- I don't want any lacquer.
- Just a drop.

57:41.667 --> 57:44.460

- Right. Usual miracle?
- Watch the neck.

57:58.016 --> 57:59.851
Plenty of lacquer for him.

58:00.018 --> 58:02.436
You know the hair falls? Down the back.

58:02.646 --> 58:04.605

58:18.745 --> 58:21.122
No, I've given 'em
a really good wringing out.

58:21.290 --> 58:23.040
They're under the sink.

58:24.459 --> 58:26.252

58:26.420 --> 58:28.462
What have you got on?

58:28.630 --> 58:31.966
Is this some kind of new fashion
I haven't heard about?

58:32.134 --> 58:34.635
- Sopping wet trousers?
- They're Levis.

58:34.803 --> 58:37.597
Never mind what they are,
they're bleeding wet.

58:37.764 --> 58:40.558

Oh, gawd help us.

I haven't got time for all that rubbish.

I can sing better than that little ape.

Call that singing?

59:45.874 --> 59:47.959
Sounds like a drowned dog.

After yesterday's session at the
conference, the Colonial Secretary

01:00:32.379 --> 01:00:36.340
commented that he hoped for a speedy
transition to independence in Aden.

01:00:36.508 --> 01:00:39.176
The Bank Holiday
started in earnest last night,

01:00:39.344 --> 01:00:42.763
with thousands of motorists
heading towards the south coast.

01:00:42.931 --> 01:00:46.309
Traffic was reported heavy on the A127,
the Southend Road,

01:00:46.476 --> 01:00:50.229
and there were jams on the M1
southbound, causing severe delays.

01:00:50.397 --> 01:00:54.066
Shopkeepers in Brighton,
fearing a reoccurrence of disturbances

01:00:54.234 --> 01:00:58.654
caused by rival gangs in other seaside
resorts, put up shutters last night.

01:00:58.822 --> 01:01:02.908
A spokesperson for the shopkeepers
said while they weren't expecting...

01:01:19.968 --> 01:01:23.095
- Watch it, Dave!
- I'll burn you off any day, son!

01:01:23.263 --> 01:01:25.473

01:12:09.951 --> 01:12:12.119
- On the beach.

01:12:18.835 --> 01:12:21.378
I don't wanna go to sleep anyway.

It's cheap.

01:12:49.657 --> 01:12:51.783

01:12:51.951 --> 01:12:54.494
I dunno,
I've never slept in a shithouse.

01:12:54.662 --> 01:12:56.455
- What d'you reckon?
- Well...

01:12:56.622 --> 01:12:59.166

01:16:08.689 --> 01:16:11.733
Yeah. They was all having a screw

01:16:11.901 --> 01:16:15.070
- Bit rough, was she?
- He don't know, he only saw her arse.

01:16:15.238 --> 01:16:17.364
Yeah, but that wasn't rough.

01:16:17.531 --> 01:16:19.699
Well, apart from the splinters.

01:16:19.867 --> 01:16:23.119
One of 'em was the geezer
that rode me off the bike yesterday.

01:16:23.287 --> 01:16:25.372
He's on my fucking list. He's dead.

01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:30.043
- It's all right if I sit down, then?
- Yeah.

01:16:31.712 --> 01:16:33.838
What you got the hump about?

01:16:34.006 --> 01:16:36.091
So why are you so humpy?

01:16:36.592 --> 01:16:38.677
It's nothing.

01:16:38.844 --> 01:16:41.429
Just looking at the sea, that's all.

01:16:41.597 --> 01:16:43.431
Oh, Christ Almighty.

01:16:44.392 --> 01:16:46.351
Take your feet off the table.

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:48.353
Piss off.

01:16:48.896 --> 01:16:51.273
Just watch it, or you're out.

01:16:55.152 --> 01:16:57.737
- Where'd you get to, then?
- Nowhere.

01:16:57.905 --> 01:17:00.031
I just kipped on the beach.

01:17:00.199 --> 01:17:02.909
You're fucking mad, you are,
getting chucked out.

01:17:03.077 --> 01:17:06.288
You should have stayed around.
You would've been well in.

01:17:06.455 --> 01:17:10.292
- What d'you mean?
- She was there on her Jack Jones.

01:17:10.459 --> 01:17:12.335
- Steph?
- Yeah.

01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:16.464
Fucking Fenton gets off
with this beatnik chick.

01:17:16.674 --> 01:17:19.426
And she's all on her own, ain't she.
I tell you...

01:17:19.593 --> 01:17:22.012
I would've been up her
like a fucking ferret.

01:17:22.388 --> 01:17:25.098
Well, if I hadn't know that you and her
were so...

01:17:25.266 --> 01:17:28.601
So what?
I ain't gone on her, you know.

01:17:28.769 --> 01:17:31.730
Leave it out,
everybody knows you fancy her.

01:17:31.897 --> 01:17:34.774
I reckon she's a right good bunk-up,
lads.

01:17:34.942 --> 01:17:36.443
You animal!

01:18:09.977 --> 01:18:11.728
- Hi.
- All right, Steph?

01:18:11.896 --> 01:18:13.980
- Great, innit?
- Where's Pete, then?

01:18:14.148 --> 01:18:17.567
- I dunno. Don't really care.
- Don't really care. Dave!

01:18:17.735 --> 01:18:18.735

That's the geezer that rode me
off the road yesterday.

Let's fucking have 'em!

01:18:55.940 --> 01:18:57.649

01:19:18.212 --> 01:19:20.380

Jesus Christ, they've gone... Oi!

01:19:25.511 --> 01:19:26.886
Get 'em in here quick.

01:19:28.222 --> 01:19:30.348
What's going on here?

01:19:33.769 --> 01:19:35.562
Over the edge.

01:19:44.655 --> 01:19:47.615

01:19:47.783 --> 01:19:50.743

01:19:50.995 --> 01:19:52.954
Look! Dan did that!

01:19:53.122 --> 01:19:55.874
There was a geezer, I tell you,
I went crack!

01:19:56.041 --> 01:19:57.208
Crack!

Where'd you get these?

01:31:23.562 --> 01:31:25.771
I dunno. Someone gave 'em to me.

01:31:25.939 --> 01:31:28.482
Did he?
And of course, you had to take 'em.

Absent for a full day last week, Cooper.

01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:19.885
Now I understand that one day's Bank
Holiday is not good enough for you,

01:33:20.804 --> 01:33:22.888
so you have to take two.

01:33:25.725 --> 01:33:28.310
May I inquire
if there's any reason for this?

01:33:29.354 --> 01:33:32.982
- Not really.
- Not ill or anything, were you?

01:33:33.733 --> 01:33:35.067
No.

01:33:35.652 --> 01:33:39.488
Mr Cale tells me that
you spent the weekend in Brighton.

01:33:40.031 --> 01:33:44.201
I imagine that you were involved to some
extent in the disturbances there.

01:33:45.537 --> 01:33:46.745
Yeah, I was there.

01:33:46.913 --> 01:33:50.165
You weren't arrested or detained
or anything, were you?

01:33:50.375 --> 01:33:51.583
No.

01:33:54.254 --> 01:33:57.715
I must say, I find your attitude
fairly incomprehensible.

01:33:58.341 --> 01:34:00.467
I feel I must warn you, Cooper,

01:34:00.635 --> 01:34:05.097
that we cannot tolerate this kind of
absenteeism amongst our junior staff.

01:34:05.265 --> 01:34:07.224
You've a good steady job here, Cooper.

01:34:07.392 --> 01:34:11.145
Plenty of young men'd give
their eye teeth to be in your shoes.

01:34:11.313 --> 01:34:13.439
Yeah? Well, find one, then.

01:34:15.608 --> 01:34:19.111
- I beg your pardon?
- You heard. I said find one, then.

01:34:19.279 --> 01:34:22.698
I'll tell you what you can do
with your eye teeth and your job.

01:34:22.866 --> 01:34:25.826
You can take that mail,
and that franking machine,

01:34:25.994 --> 01:34:28.746
and all that other rubbish
I have to go about with,

01:34:28.913 --> 01:34:31.957
and you can stuff 'em
right up your ass!

01:34:33.376 --> 01:34:35.002
Hey, Jimmy.

01:34:35.211 --> 01:34:37.963
What did you do?
Lose a shilling and find sixpence?

01:34:42.302 --> 01:34:46.430
- Well, look who it isn't.
- Jimmy! I thought they'd locked you up.

01:34:46.639 --> 01:34:49.600
Yeah, I got fined, didn't I. Fifty quid.

01:34:49.809 --> 01:34:52.853
- Jesus.
- Another good customer bites the dust.

01:34:53.063 --> 01:34:55.314
Sorry, but we couldn't
hang around for you.

01:34:55.523 --> 01:34:58.817
- We had to get back to our jobs.
- Yeah? Well, I ain't bothered.

01:34:58.985 --> 01:35:00.944

01:35:01.112 --> 01:35:03.655

- Yeah. How many you want?

01:35:26.179 --> 01:35:28.222
Dunno. Well, how many you got?

01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:31.100
- A ton. French blues.
- Yeah, I'll have the lot.

01:35:31.309 --> 01:35:33.018
- What?
- You can't afford it.

01:35:34.437 --> 01:35:36.605

Two weeks' money.

01:35:40.527 --> 01:35:43.445
Told him to stuff the job
right up his ass, didn't I?

01:35:44.656 --> 01:35:49.159

Fancied something outdoors.

01:36:26.406 --> 01:36:28.574
I found her by the road in Brighton.

01:36:42.964 --> 01:36:45.090
Maybe there's some trouble at home.

01:37:08.615 --> 01:37:11.200

- Go back to bed.
- Come on in.

01:39:17.285 --> 01:39:21.288
- You wanna wake the whole street up?
- It's a bit late to worry about that.

01:39:21.456 --> 01:39:24.249

I'll kill him.

01:39:24.417 --> 01:39:28.962

01:41:23.536 --> 01:41:26.580
- I kipped out, didn't I?
- In some nuthouse?

01:41:26.748 --> 01:41:28.749
Look, I ain't mad, you know.

01:41:28.916 --> 01:41:30.959
What is wrong with you, then?

01:41:31.169 --> 01:41:32.335
Well, I dunno,

01:41:32.503 --> 01:41:36.673
it's just it seems like everything's
going backwards, that's all, Steph.

01:41:38.634 --> 01:41:41.219
You sure it's not you
that's going backwards?

01:41:41.387 --> 01:41:43.555
No, it's just...

01:41:43.723 --> 01:41:45.891
I can't think straight, that's all.

01:41:46.058 --> 01:41:49.144
I mean, nothing seems right,
apart from Brighton.

01:41:49.312 --> 01:41:53.231

Going to court with the Ace and that.

01:41:53.399 --> 01:41:56.067
And, like, I was a mod there, you know?

01:41:56.235 --> 01:42:00.363
- I mean that's something, innit, eh?
- Oh, what are you talking about?

01:42:00.531 --> 01:42:04.659
Brighton was a laugh. That's why we
went down. It was a giggle, that's all.

01:42:04.827 --> 01:42:08.205
Oh, yeah? And me and you, then?

01:42:08.372 --> 01:42:11.041
- Was that just a giggle?
- What do you think?

01:42:12.126 --> 01:42:15.253
All right, so I fancied you.
We had it off together.

01:42:15.421 --> 01:42:18.757
- But that don't mean nothing, does it?
- It did to fucking me!

01:42:18.925 --> 01:42:21.092
Well, I can't help that, Jimmy, can I?

01:42:21.260 --> 01:42:23.762

you were gonna go off your nut...

01:42:23.930 --> 01:42:26.097
I told you, I ain't fucking mad, right?

01:42:26.265 --> 01:42:28.099
No, not much. Look at you.
