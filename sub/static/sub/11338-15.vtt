00:02.836 --> 00:05.172
Whoo!

00:05.173 --> 00:06.673
Come on. Come on.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.041
Sophia.

00:08.042 --> 00:10.423
Honey.

00:10.424 --> 00:11.857
Ooh!

00:11.858 --> 00:13.199
What is mommy feeding you?

00:13.200 --> 00:15.014
Oh, nice. Give our
daughter a weight complex.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.117
Do you have a weight complex?

00:16.117 --> 00:17.115
Yes.

00:18.213 --> 00:19.811
Let's go inside.

00:19.812 --> 00:21.910
"though I wal in the midst of trouble,

00:21.911 --> 00:23.708
"you preserve my life.

00:23.709 --> 00:26.674
"you stretch out your hand
against the anger of my foes,

00:26.675 --> 00:30.076
"and with your right hand, you save me.

00:30.077 --> 00:31.842
The word of the lord."

00:31.843 --> 00:34.042
Thanks be to god.

00:35.743 --> 00:37.109
The body of christ.

00:37.110 --> 00:39.177
Amen.

00:40.011 --> 00:42.110
Amen. The body of christ.

00:45.445 --> 00:46.712
The body of christ.

00:46.713 --> 00:49.212
Amen. The blood of christ.

00:57.950 --> 01:00.883
Daddy, can I have some of that?

01:00.884 --> 01:01.951
Not till you're 21

01:01.952 --> 01:04.885
Or your first communion.

01:18.391 --> 01:20.092
Mommy, my doll--

01:20.093 --> 01:21.692
No! Ok, I'm taking this away from you.

01:21.693 --> 01:24.928
Hey, ok, now is not the time to play.

01:24.929 --> 01:26.895
After communion, we talk to jesus.

01:26.896 --> 01:28.329
I don't want to talk to jesus!

01:28.330 --> 01:32.866
Well, try. Listen, I know it's hard,
but if you really try...

01:32.867 --> 01:35.001
You' be--

01:35.002 --> 01:37.103
Honey? Honey?

01:38.138 --> 01:40.304
Paul! Help! Oh, god!

01:40.305 --> 01:42.105
Please! Somebody help me!

01:42.106 --> 01:43.938
Somebody, please! Please help me!

01:43.939 --> 01:46.006
Please! Please help me!

01:46.007 --> 01:47.240
Daddy, are you all right?!

01:47.241 --> 01:48.641
Is anyone a doctor?!

01:48.642 --> 01:50.409
Call 911!

01:50.410 --> 01:52.077
Oh, no!

01:52.078 --> 01:53.878
Oh, please! Daddy!

01:53.879 --> 01:55.379
Take your daughter away! Now!

01:55.380 --> 01:57.080
Baby! Baby, come here! Come here.

01:57.081 --> 01:58.448
Come here. Come here. Come on.

01:58.449 --> 01:59.749
Paul.

01:59.750 --> 02:01.015
Paul.

02:01.016 --> 02:02.616
Paul!

02:02.617 --> 02:04.851
Paul!

02:04.852 --> 02:06.952
Call 911!

02:06.953 --> 02:08.286
This is captain paul collins.

02:08.287 --> 02:09.753
He's the third victim in 2 weeks

02:09.755 --> 02:11.188
In providence, rhode island.

02:11.189 --> 02:12.155
Captain?

02:12.156 --> 02:14.523
Yeah, he just returned home 2 weeks ago

02:14.524 --> 02:16.125
From his fourth tour in iraq.

02:16.126 --> 02:17.926
He's a decorated war hero.

02:17.927 --> 02:19.760
Was he targeted because
he's in the military?

02:19.761 --> 02:22.428
No. Just like the first two victims,
he was targeted because he was convenient.

02:22.429 --> 02:24.296
He was killed at a church
during an early service.

02:24.297 --> 02:26.631
No. Just like the first two victneck was
cut open,ed becasevered the carotid artery.

02:26.632 --> 02:27.832
Bled out in a matter of moments.

02:27.833 --> 02:29.000
Right in front of his daughter.

02:29.001 --> 02:30.500
Murder in a church is highly symbolic.

02:30.501 --> 02:32.002
Is there a religious agenda involved?

02:32.003 --> 02:33.469
The detective on the case, jake moreland,

02:33.470 --> 02:35.437
Ruled that out because
of the first two victims.

02:35.438 --> 02:37.572
The first victim, mike o'donnell, was found

02:37.573 --> 02:39.306
Under a sink in the men's
room at a restaurant.

02:39.307 --> 02:40.774
What kind of restaurant?

02:40.775 --> 02:43.210
Local place, white tablecloths and jug wine.

02:43.211 --> 02:45.845
The second victim, karen lagrassa,
was killed at the laundromat.

02:45.846 --> 02:47.579
All 3 had their throats slashe

02:47.580 --> 02:49.080
Aside from m.O., the
victimology's all over the place.

02:49.081 --> 02:51.782
It's like this guy doesn't
care who he's killing,

02:51.783 --> 02:52.783
Just how.

02:52.784 --> 02:54.117
And he's doing it in public

02:54.118 --> 02:56.118
Without compunction for who sees him.

02:56.119 --> 02:57.319
Do we have a sketch?

02:57.320 --> 02:58.954
All anyone can agree on

02:58.955 --> 03:01.889
Is that it's a white male between 25 and 40.

03:01.890 --> 03:04.224
Well, that narrows it
down to all of providence.

03:04.225 --> 03:07.293
Hard to fault the witnesses given
how bloody these murders must be.

03:07.294 --> 03:08.660
What bothers me is the cooling off period

03:08.661 --> 03:09.995
Is getting shorter and shorter,

03:09.996 --> 03:12.630
With no attempt to hide who
he is or what he's doing.

03:12.631 --> 03:16.399
I mean, an unsub this bold could be
suffering from a major psychotic break.

03:16.400 --> 03:18.267
I already asked detective
moreland to pull recent releases

03:18.268 --> 03:19.601
On prisons and mental hospitals.

03:19.602 --> 03:21.069
We need to get to providence asap.

03:21.070 --> 03:23.404
Whether he's suffering a
psychotic break or not,

03:23.405 --> 03:24.905
This could be the start of a spree.

03:24.906 --> 03:27.440
And anyone is a potential target.

03:52.061 --> 04:01.263
<font color="#ffff00">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

04:02.090 --> 04:03.657
"show me a hero

04:03.658 --> 04:06.092
And I will write you tragedy."

04:06.093 --> 04:09.228
F. Scott fitzgerald.

04:09.229 --> 04:10.697
Why is he using a knife?

04:10.698 --> 04:12.698
Guns assure the highest
number of fatalities.

04:12.699 --> 04:15.400
If all he's interested in is quantity,

04:15.401 --> 04:17.369
He could be doing this more efficiently.

04:17.370 --> 04:18.736
He could be training.

04:18.737 --> 04:20.505
Spree killers often to dry runs

04:20.505 --> 04:21.906
Before they start their rampage.

04:21.906 --> 04:24.075
Most spree killers have lost
control by the time they begin.

04:24.076 --> 04:25.376
They're always male.

04:25.377 --> 04:27.412
And if they don't fall into
the school shooter category,

04:27.413 --> 04:29.747
They're older, 40s and 50s,
socially isolated.

04:29.748 --> 04:31.381
The stressor's usually the dissolution

04:31.382 --> 04:33.415
Of their last social outlet.

04:33.416 --> 04:35.417
George hennard was
inspired by james huberty.

04:35.418 --> 04:38.419
Between the two of them, they shot
43 people at fast food restaurants.

04:38.420 --> 04:40.587
Well, if he's practicing
for his mass murder,

04:40.588 --> 04:42.388
He's definitely getting bolder about it.

04:42.389 --> 04:43.589
And bloodier.

04:43.590 --> 04:45.757
Right now, the shock and
awe of the bloodletting

04:45.758 --> 04:47.424
Seems to be what he's going for.

04:47.425 --> 04:49.059
But soon, that won't be enough.

04:49.060 --> 04:51.328
That makes sense with
regards to his fantasy life.

04:51.329 --> 04:52.762
If he is planning something big,

04:52.763 --> 04:54.230
He'll spend his day dreaming of it,

04:54.231 --> 04:55.765
Getting back at slights
both real and imagined.

04:55.766 --> 04:57.533
Without a specific target victim,

04:57.534 --> 04:59.669
We need to concentrate on the crime scenes

04:59.670 --> 05:02.137
And see what they tell us.
Prentiss, you take the laundromat.

05:02.138 --> 05:03.538
I'll have detective moreland meet you there.

05:03.539 --> 05:05.006
I'd like to take a look at the church

05:05.007 --> 05:06.173
If you don't mind.

05:06.174 --> 05:07.207
Good. Jj, you and morgan

05:07.208 --> 05:08.809
Interview captain collins' wife.

05:08.810 --> 05:10.243
She got the best look at the unsub.

05:10.244 --> 05:11.377
See what she remembers.

05:11.378 --> 05:13.747
Reid and I will run point
from the police station.

05:30.532 --> 05:31.565
Agent rossi?

05:31.566 --> 05:33.066
You must be father kendellen.

05:33.067 --> 05:34.934
Thank you for coming so quickly.

05:34.935 --> 05:36.536
It's the lst we can do, father.

05:36.537 --> 05:39.337
To be honest,

05:39.338 --> 05:41.838
I've been struggling to understand all this.

05:41.839 --> 05:43.573
It's been...Trying.

05:43.574 --> 05:45.976
I don't like to see crime tape

05:45.977 --> 05:47.344
In front of church doors.

05:47.345 --> 05:48.611
I can't imagine how you feel.

05:48.612 --> 05:52.581
Ash Wednesday's next week.

05:52.582 --> 05:55.950
These doors should never
be closed to the community.

06:00.788 --> 06:02.154
To be honest, agent hotchner,

06:02.155 --> 06:03.689
When they told me bau was coming,

06:03.690 --> 06:05.023
I expected more than two agents.

06:05.024 --> 06:07.359
The rest of the agents went
straight to the crime scenes.

06:07.360 --> 06:08.860
I believe there'll be information there

06:08.861 --> 06:11.029
That may determine where
the unsub will strike next.

06:11.030 --> 06:12.697
As soon as you can, I'd like you to meet

06:12.698 --> 06:14.231
Agent prentiss at the laundromat.

06:14.232 --> 06:15.833
Yeah, sure.

06:16.868 --> 06:18.902
Any idea on where he may hit next?

06:18.903 --> 06:20.370
We can double patrols.

06:20.371 --> 06:21.871
It's honestly too early to tell.

06:21.872 --> 06:24.206
Well, your gut must be
telling you something.

06:24.207 --> 06:26.708
Well, this far, he's struck
at a restaurant bathroom,

06:26.709 --> 06:28.343
A laundromat, and a church.

06:28.344 --> 06:30.878
He chooses his victims
not out of preference,

06:30.879 --> 06:32.379
But of favorable circumstance.

06:32.380 --> 06:33.880
With each kill he's growing bolder,

06:33.881 --> 06:37.217
Telling us he doesn't care who sees him.

06:37.218 --> 06:39.252
So next time it'll be even more public.

06:39.253 --> 06:40.720
Yes. Our technical analyst

06:40.721 --> 06:42.321
Is compiling a list of public events

06:42.322 --> 06:43.922
That your department should be monitoring.

06:43.923 --> 06:45.490
Garcia, aryou there?

06:46.525 --> 06:49.027
Wired for sound and ready for action.

06:49.028 --> 06:50.227
What have you got so far?

06:50.228 --> 06:51.729
Well, you got your "sesame street on ice,"

06:51.730 --> 06:54.330
Your harlem globetrotters,
your beatles cover bands,

06:54.331 --> 06:56.198
Not to mention the dozens of college bars

06:56.199 --> 06:58.999
And late-night hangouts frequented
by the youth of america.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.535
No event is too big or too small.

07:01.536 --> 07:02.602
Good. Keep going.

07:02.603 --> 07:04.904
Aye, aye, cap'n.

08:05.620 --> 08:07.988
No respect, even now.

08:07.989 --> 08:10.157
I do the talking.

08:10.158 --> 08:12.959
No comment, no comment, no comment.

08:15.762 --> 08:18.564
What's the fbi's involment
in the investigation

08:18.565 --> 08:20.499
No comment. In the murder
of captain collins?

08:20.500 --> 08:22.067
We are strictly here

08:22.068 --> 08:24.503
Just to advise the
providence police department.

08:24.504 --> 08:27.106
Is the collins murder tied to the
other two stabbings of last week?

08:27.107 --> 08:29.508
And when they are ready
to make their statement,

08:29.509 --> 08:30.876
They'll let you know.

08:30.877 --> 08:31.943
Thank you.

08:31.944 --> 08:33.544
They've been out there all day.

08:33.544 --> 08:35.513
Some of my friends wanted to come by,

08:35.514 --> 08:37.347
They didn't want to be on the 6:00 news.

08:37.349 --> 08:39.549
Your husband's a hero. Unfortunately,

08:39.551 --> 08:41.017
The circumstances of his death

08:41.018 --> 08:43.019
Has caused this to be a media circus.

08:43.020 --> 08:45.253
Well, you'd think they'd show a little--

08:45.254 --> 08:46.488
Hey!

08:46.489 --> 08:48.956
What did I tell you, sophia?

08:48.957 --> 08:51.158
Get away from the window.

08:51.159 --> 08:53.026
Are we going to be on tv?

08:53.027 --> 08:54.994
Not if I can help it.

08:54.995 --> 08:56.795
Go in your room and play.

08:56.796 --> 08:58.530
I'll be there in a sec.

09:03.001 --> 09:05.635
I spent years waiting for a phone call

09:05.636 --> 09:08.838
Or one of those letters
they used to hand-deliver

09:08.839 --> 09:10.473
To dead soldiers' wives.

09:10.474 --> 09:14.009
They want to know if I want to bury paul

09:14.010 --> 09:15.510
At--at arlington,

09:15.511 --> 09:19.113
But I don't have--

09:23.185 --> 09:25.219
Ok.

09:27.855 --> 09:31.156
I know you have a job to do.

09:31.157 --> 09:33.659
Let's do this so it's done right.

09:35.862 --> 09:39.364
That's what paul would say.

09:39.365 --> 09:41.465
What do you need to know?

09:41.466 --> 09:44.201
It happened right here.

09:44.202 --> 09:46.503
You told the police you weren't sure

09:46.504 --> 09:48.705
When the unsub walked in?

09:48.706 --> 09:50.272
Yes.

09:52.041 --> 09:53.675
I don't know.

09:53.676 --> 09:56.811
One ment he wasn't there, and then he was.

09:56.812 --> 09:58.646
All right, let's walk through the mass.

09:58.647 --> 10:01.448
You told the police that you were late.

10:01.449 --> 10:04.984
They came in during the first reading.

10:04.985 --> 10:07.519
You know most of your parishioners on sight?

10:07.520 --> 10:08.520
Yes.

10:08.521 --> 10:10.555
But not the unsub, right?

10:10.556 --> 10:12.690
No.

10:12.691 --> 10:16.294
I don't know how I could have missed him.

10:16.295 --> 10:18.896
You know the collins
family personally, right?

10:18.897 --> 10:20.364
Of course.

10:20.365 --> 10:22.333
I mean, paul, he grew up at this school.

10:22.334 --> 10:26.536
Whenever he came home,
he made sure to come to mass.

10:26.537 --> 10:28.304
And they sat there in the back

10:28.305 --> 10:30.539
So as not to disturb the mass?

10:30.540 --> 10:31.941
Yes.

10:31.942 --> 10:33.408
Once they were settled,

10:33.409 --> 10:35.076
Could you see them?

10:36.912 --> 10:38.045
No.

10:38.046 --> 10:41.215
Then let yourself off the hook, father.

10:41.216 --> 10:44.051
If you couldn't see the collins family,

10:44.052 --> 10:46.586
You couldn't see the killer.

10:48.288 --> 10:49.889
No.

10:49.890 --> 10:51.590
But he was definitely there by communion?

10:51.591 --> 10:52.591
Yes.

10:52.592 --> 10:54.359
Not before?

10:54.360 --> 10:55.760
I don't remember.

10:55.761 --> 10:58.329
All right. Meg, we can take a break

10:58.330 --> 11:00.297
If you need to take a break.

11:03.835 --> 11:07.704
Hey. What is it, sweetie?

11:07.705 --> 11:09.606
I shook his hand.

11:09.607 --> 11:12.208
When was that?

11:12.209 --> 11:14.343
When we all say, "peace be with you"

11:14.344 --> 11:17.379
And we shake hands.

11:17.380 --> 11:19.548
I shook his hand.

11:19.549 --> 11:21.816
That's right.

11:21.817 --> 11:23.651
She's right.

11:23.652 --> 11:26.220
During the sign of the peace.

11:26.221 --> 11:29.823
He touched my baby. He--

11:30.825 --> 11:31.959
Ank you.

11:31.960 --> 11:35.361
Oh, god. He t--he touched my baby.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.697
Meg, I know this is difficult.

11:37.698 --> 11:39.731
But I want you to try and focus.

11:39.732 --> 11:42.767
Ok? Stay with me.

11:42.768 --> 11:46.336
I need you to tell me what
happened during communion.

11:48.572 --> 11:50.239
We all got up.

11:50.240 --> 11:52.407
Who got out first, paul?

11:52.408 --> 11:54.842
Yes.

11:54.843 --> 11:58.282
But he let me and sophia

11:58.283 --> 12:00.450
Go first.

12:00.451 --> 12:02.819
Paul always goes last.

12:05.523 --> 12:08.158
We--we took communion

12:08.159 --> 12:11.261
And we--we went back and we, uh...

12:14.865 --> 12:15.865
We...

12:15.866 --> 12:17.166
That's ok.

12:17.167 --> 12:19.134
We're almost done.

12:19.135 --> 12:21.135
You're doing great.

12:22.204 --> 12:24.638
Paul was on your right.

12:24.639 --> 12:27.040
Sophia was on your left.

12:27.041 --> 12:28.608
What happened?

12:29.544 --> 12:32.379
She was playing.

12:32.380 --> 12:35.815
And after communion, you pray.

12:37.017 --> 12:39.418
I leaned down and I told her that.

12:39.419 --> 12:43.722
So you were facing to your left,
away from paul,

12:43.723 --> 12:45.958
Away from the killer.

12:45.959 --> 12:50.362
You never see him coming,
you never see him go.

12:53.533 --> 12:55.667
I need a break.

12:55.668 --> 12:58.536
Of course.

13:02.174 --> 13:04.008
I want to stay here.

13:04.009 --> 13:07.977
Meg might recall...

13:07.978 --> 13:09.479
More, and even if she doesn't,

13:09.480 --> 13:12.214
What she's going through...

13:13.350 --> 13:14.683
What's wrong?

13:14.684 --> 13:15.751
This unsub isn't psychotic

13:15.752 --> 13:17.686
And he's not gonna go on a spree.

13:17.687 --> 13:19.187
He's too patient.

13:19.188 --> 13:21.956
Ok, but...

13:21.957 --> 13:24.725
What is he trying to accomplish?

13:26.527 --> 13:28.828
I don't know.

13:31.064 --> 13:32.700
Get the stuff out...

13:33.951 --> 13:35.918
All right, I'm folding...

13:35.919 --> 13:37.285
I don't hear you approaching.

13:37.286 --> 13:40.054
You always talk to yourself?

13:40.055 --> 13:41.689
Good. If these machines were on,

13:41.690 --> 13:43.557
I definitely wouldn't hear
you come up behind me.

13:43.558 --> 13:45.259
Jake moreland, providence p.D.

13:45.260 --> 13:46.260
Emily prentiss.

13:46.261 --> 13:48.128
Great. Can you do that again?

13:48.129 --> 13:50.463
Sure.

13:50.464 --> 13:52.498
Ok.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.133
You come in through the back door,

13:54.134 --> 13:56.568
Slash my throat, walk out.

13:56.569 --> 13:59.170
There's no cameras inside
or outside of the building.

13:59.171 --> 14:01.105
The same is true for all the crime scenes.

14:01.106 --> 14:04.141
Which means you're smart enough
to plan for that in your attacks.

14:04.142 --> 14:06.877
Mm-hmm. But, careless enough
to drop a knife 10 feet

14:06.878 --> 14:07.911
After I cut you.

14:07.912 --> 14:09.479
But you didn't leave any fingerprints.

14:09.480 --> 14:12.715
No. He did that at all 3 crime scenes.

14:12.716 --> 14:15.550
Mass murderers and spree killers,

14:15.551 --> 14:16.918
They often fetishize their weapons,

14:16.919 --> 14:20.054
But this guy discards his. Why?

14:20.055 --> 14:22.990
He can get a new knife anytime he wants.

14:22.991 --> 14:24.858
They carry these at army/navy stores.

14:24.859 --> 14:27.060
It could be a scare tactic.

14:27.061 --> 14:28.361
Hoso?

14:28.362 --> 14:30.463
Americans typically are more terrified

14:30.464 --> 14:34.766
By the presence of a knife than a gun.

14:34.767 --> 14:37.468
They're more likely to scream
out for help if they see a gun,

14:37.469 --> 14:39.703
Whereas they'll comply if they see a blade.

14:39.704 --> 14:43.473
So, victimology and murder weapon

14:43.474 --> 14:44.641
Aren't important to this guy.

14:44.642 --> 14:45.709
What does that leave?

14:45.710 --> 14:47.444
What is he attacking?

14:47.445 --> 14:49.012
The crime scene itself.

14:49.013 --> 14:52.582
Did you see the sign outside
when this place was established?

14:52.583 --> 14:53.483
1967.

14:53.484 --> 14:55.017
The same as the restaurant.

14:55.018 --> 14:56.519
Second generation italian.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.720
Everyone in the neighborhood eats there.

14:58.721 --> 15:01.355
St. Alvina's was built at the
beginning of the last century.

15:01.356 --> 15:04.791
So each location has a
history in this community.

15:04.792 --> 15:07.060
So he wants to destroy landmarks,

15:07.061 --> 15:08.895
Pieces of providence's history.

15:08.896 --> 15:10.396
That's why the random victims.

15:10.397 --> 15:11.731
He's making a point.

15:11.732 --> 15:13.432
Probably the manifestation

15:13.433 --> 15:14.899
Of a deep hatred for the city.

15:14.900 --> 15:16.534
He wants to scar the places

15:16.535 --> 15:18.202
Everybody knows and goes to.

15:18.203 --> 15:20.103
Not quite. Take a ride with me.

15:20.104 --> 15:22.071
We're gonna have a look
at the other crime scenes.

15:22.072 --> 15:23.072
Why?

15:23.073 --> 15:24.340
Indulge me.

15:33.916 --> 15:37.018
Attack an institution, everybody responds.

15:37.019 --> 15:40.521
Neighbors come out,
the mayor assigns extra cops.

15:40.522 --> 15:43.023
A place of worship turns into a crime scene,

15:43.024 --> 15:45.391
You feel personally assaulted.

15:45.392 --> 15:46.559
That's what gets him off.

15:46.560 --> 15:48.093
The response. Public outcry.

15:48.094 --> 15:49.862
He wants the big show.

15:49.863 --> 15:51.930
You think he's revisiting the crime scenes?

15:51.931 --> 15:54.300
Not just revisiting.

15:54.301 --> 15:55.668
Reliving.

15:55.669 --> 15:58.370
He's found a way to keep
the murders he's committed

15:58.371 --> 16:01.206
Fresh because they're
always on the city's mind.

16:04.444 --> 16:06.311
"witnesses say they didn't see it happen,

16:06.312 --> 16:10.582
Were alerted by the screams of
the victim's wife and daughter."

16:10.583 --> 16:12.950
Man alive, in a church.

16:12.951 --> 16:15.953
This guy, he ain't afraid onothin'.

16:15.954 --> 16:16.954
Need anything?

16:16.955 --> 16:18.689
I'm gonna grab a smoke.

16:18.690 --> 16:21.591
Careful, connie, those things'll kill ya.

17:01.035 --> 17:02.468
Careful, it's hot.

17:02.469 --> 17:05.737
Oh, good. 'cause I love my tea really warm.

17:05.738 --> 17:08.306
Would you like some cream and
sugar with your tea, too?

17:08.307 --> 17:09.874
Please.

17:14.278 --> 17:17.481
That's how miss tuffet likes her tea, too.

17:17.482 --> 17:18.548
Oh.

17:18.549 --> 17:19.950
Thank you.

17:22.386 --> 17:24.020
It's good.

17:24.021 --> 17:28.223
But I think sophia's tea
is a little bit better.

17:28.224 --> 17:30.627
Thank you.

17:30.628 --> 17:32.362
How many do you have?

17:33.497 --> 17:35.331
You're too good at this not to be a mom.

17:35.332 --> 17:37.267
One. A boy.

17:37.268 --> 17:41.170
Sophia's first communion is
supposed to be next week.

17:41.171 --> 17:42.805
She'll do great.

17:43.907 --> 17:45.240
Oh. Excuse me.

17:49.179 --> 17:50.479
Hey, rossi.

17:50.480 --> 17:52.648
We're just getting ready
to deliver the profile,

17:52.649 --> 17:55.217
But I need you to do something.

17:55.218 --> 17:56.619
Mm-hmm.

17:56.620 --> 17:58.821
I understand.

17:59.656 --> 18:02.191
Ok, uh, call me when you find out more.

18:02.192 --> 18:05.026
Bye.

18:05.027 --> 18:09.530
Sophia, mommy and agent
jareau need some privacy, ok?

18:10.366 --> 18:12.033
Thank you for the tea.

18:12.034 --> 18:13.868
You're welcome.

18:19.473 --> 18:22.008
I know that tone of voice.

18:22.009 --> 18:23.810
It's always followed by bad news.

18:23.811 --> 18:28.148
You should know a lot of these
guys need to feel powerful.

18:28.149 --> 18:32.486
Producing a spectacle gives
them that sense of pride.

18:32.487 --> 18:36.757
I'm trying to quell that by
controlling the circus outside.

18:36.758 --> 18:38.925
Is he watching us?

18:39.894 --> 18:41.361
Maybe.

18:41.362 --> 18:44.831
We think he revisits his crime scenes.

18:44.832 --> 18:47.900
It's possible the media
could have brought him here.

18:47.901 --> 18:51.704
He won't shake my daughter's
hand this time if he does.

18:51.705 --> 18:54.674
It's possible hotch: We suggest
that youve think of this unsub here.

18:54.675 --> 18:56.642
Not as a slasher but as an arsonist.

18:56.643 --> 18:58.377
Because the gratification he's getting

18:58.378 --> 18:59.978
Isn't from the physical act of murder

18:59.979 --> 19:01.813
But from the public's reaction to it.

19:01.814 --> 19:03.848
Arsonists draw attention to themselves

19:03.849 --> 19:08.487
Through the fires they set.

19:08.488 --> 19:11.256
While this unsub will
never set an actual fire,

19:11.257 --> 19:13.658
He has the same psychosis as one who does.

19:13.659 --> 19:15.326
Our unsub fits that model.

19:15.327 --> 19:17.427
His locations have been
pillars of the community.

19:17.428 --> 19:20.163
The victims he picks aren't
as important as the effect

19:20.164 --> 19:21.697
Of killing them outside of
your favorite restaurant

19:21.698 --> 19:23.232
Or place of worship.

19:40.380 --> 19:41.981
By picking locales wit
the highest visibility,

19:41.982 --> 19:44.751
He's creating the highest level
of fear in that neighborhood,

19:44.752 --> 19:46.886
Which reinforces his feeling of power.

19:46.887 --> 19:48.720
Yeah, but arsonists don't
set out to hurt people.

19:48.721 --> 19:50.855
This guy clearly does.

19:50.856 --> 19:52.189
That's true. And this unsub

19:52.190 --> 19:54.258
Definitely falls in the
category of sociopath.

19:54.259 --> 19:56.627
His victims are there
only to achieve his goal.

19:56.628 --> 19:59.362
He doesn't have the ability
to empathize with them.

19:59.363 --> 20:02.264
To him, they're just tools for him to use,

20:02.265 --> 20:05.534
No different than a can
of gasoline and a match.

20:05.535 --> 20:07.169
I'll talk to you later, sweetie.

20:07.170 --> 20:09.804
I'm just at the market right now.

20:09.805 --> 20:12.673
All right. I love you, too.

20:36.928 --> 20:39.230
But even how he kills tells us something.

20:39.231 --> 20:42.401
Slashing a throat is a messy, visual act.

20:42.402 --> 20:43.935
It's designed to create attention,

20:43.936 --> 20:45.270
Just like a fire.

20:45.271 --> 20:46.704
Arsonists are often ssion based.

20:46.705 --> 20:48.906
They need make sure their
first fire has burnt out

20:48.907 --> 20:50.308
Before they set another one.

20:50.309 --> 20:51.543
Are these organic?

20:51.544 --> 20:52.677
Yeah.

20:52.678 --> 20:55.479
You know, I think I have
a fresher bunch of those

20:55.480 --> 20:57.115
Back in the truck. Holdn one second.

20:57.116 --> 20:59.451
They're also highly disciplined and focused.

20:59.452 --> 21:00.820
If conditions aren't right to set a fire,

21:00.821 --> 21:03.355
Or in this case, slash a throat,
they'll move on.

21:03.356 --> 21:04.623
You know, I'm sorry, I don't.

21:04.624 --> 21:06.524
Which actually makes this your lucky day.

21:06.525 --> 21:08.192
If you want to get something else,

21:08.193 --> 21:09.360
These hydrangeas are perfect.

21:09.361 --> 21:10.762
They have to go home with somebody.

21:10.763 --> 21:12.363
I'll give them to you for half.

21:12.364 --> 21:14.499
They're beautiful.
O home absolutely, I'll take them.

21:14.500 --> 21:18.636
Blue for your eyes. How about that?

21:18.637 --> 21:20.571
In addition to his need to kill,

21:20.572 --> 21:21.672
He has self-control.

21:21.673 --> 21:24.007
He has a short cooling off period

21:24.008 --> 21:25.208
Because he's enjoying what he's doing.

21:25.209 --> 21:26.843
This in turn feeds his ego

21:26.844 --> 21:28.378
And keeps him covering his tracks.

21:28.379 --> 21:29.846
This makes him even more dangerous.

21:29.847 --> 21:32.382
If he gets frustrated,
encounters too many obstacles,

21:32.383 --> 21:35.452
Or suffers a blow to his narcissistic ego,

21:35.453 --> 21:37.220
he could go on an all-out rampage.

21:37.221 --> 21:38.722
Focus on men between jobs.

21:38.723 --> 21:40.557
Instead of working consistently,

21:40.558 --> 21:43.427
He is hunting at his next location.

21:43.428 --> 21:45.096
and he's revisiting his old scenes.

21:45.097 --> 21:46.664
We recommend you--

21:48.033 --> 21:49.334
Yeah.

21:49.335 --> 21:51.936
The news crews are leaving
the collins house.

21:51.937 --> 21:53.638
He's killed again.

21:53.639 --> 21:55.606
Yeah. Farmers market at third and shelby.

21:55.607 --> 21:56.872
The press are already on their way.

21:56.873 --> 21:57.940
We could use that.

21:57.941 --> 21:59.007
It'll feed his ego.

21:59.008 --> 22:00.442
He'll want to stay and watch.

22:00.443 --> 22:02.677
Ladies and gentlemen,
when you get to the crime scene,

22:02.678 --> 22:04.178
We need you to canvass the crowd.

22:04.179 --> 22:06.547
Pay particular attention
to onlookers who might be

22:06.548 --> 22:08.516
More interested in the scene
itself than the victim.

22:08.517 --> 22:10.551
And get photographs of everyone.

22:10.552 --> 22:11.719
Excuse me.

22:11.720 --> 22:13.187
Jj, I need you there.

22:13.188 --> 22:15.489
No, hotch, I-- I can't leave.

22:15.490 --> 22:17.024
Jj, you're there to control the media.

22:17.025 --> 22:18.726
They've left to cover the crime scene,

22:18.727 --> 22:20.661
Which may distract the unsub.

22:20.662 --> 22:23.363
We can catch him,
but I need you on top of the press

22:23.364 --> 22:28.435
Making sure they're focud on
our goals and not the unsub's.

22:28.436 --> 22:30.270
Jj.

22:30.271 --> 22:32.473
Yeah. I'm on my way.

22:39.080 --> 22:42.048
I'm so sor.

22:42.049 --> 22:45.251
It's ok. I know that tone of voice, too.

22:55.996 --> 22:57.530
Somebody died?

22:57.531 --> 22:59.599
H, my god.

22:59.600 --> 23:00.766
Wt happened?

23:00.767 --> 23:04.102
I bet it was that stabber.

23:04.103 --> 23:05.870
Stabber? What stabber?

23:05.871 --> 23:08.006
You know, the y who's been cutting

23:08.007 --> 23:10.642
People's throats open around town.

23:10.643 --> 23:13.044
Right. Him.

23:15.248 --> 23:16.281
Come with me, sir.

23:16.282 --> 23:17.249
What?

23:17.250 --> 23:18.717
What? Come on.

23:18.718 --> 23:19.785
Wait, what? Come on.

23:19.786 --> 23:21.153
Let's go. Providence pole.

23:21.154 --> 23:22.321
Go ahead, emily.

23:24.057 --> 23:26.291
Hey, rossi, I got a trail of blood here,

23:26.292 --> 23:27.691
But I haven't found the knife yet.

23:27.692 --> 23:28.691
He ran away.

23:28.692 --> 23:30.090
See where it ends.

23:30.091 --> 23:31.857
Got it.

23:46.604 --> 23:48.805
We can't run this locally.

23:48.806 --> 23:50.306
Run? It's ran, it's gone.

23:50.307 --> 23:52.008
Cnn's leading with this in 3 hours.

23:52.009 --> 23:53.376
Minimize his impact.

23:53.377 --> 23:54.810
Do not give him a name.

23:54.811 --> 23:56.345
It'll just encourage him to kill more.

23:56.346 --> 24:00.449
Am I making this deal for full access?

24:00.450 --> 24:01.817
Of course.

24:01.818 --> 24:04.520
Just attribute the good
work to the providence p.D.

24:04.521 --> 24:06.689
And leave us out of it.

24:10.994 --> 24:13.629
He was just a nice guy who worked here.

24:13.630 --> 24:16.465
I'd en him here before but
never bought anything from him.

24:16.466 --> 24:17.999
What do you remember about the attack?

24:18.000 --> 24:20.134
I asked if his flowers were organic.

24:20.135 --> 24:22.337
I turned away, and the next thing I know

24:22.338 --> 24:24.505
I felt something warm. It was blood.

24:24.506 --> 24:26.007
Did you get a look at
the guy with the knife?

24:26.008 --> 24:28.509
The first person I saw was
a guy screaming for help

24:28.510 --> 24:30.011
And he was trying to stop the bleeding.

24:30.012 --> 24:31.846
A bunch of people ran
over there trying to help,

24:31.847 --> 24:33.715
And I think I just stood there screaming.

24:33.716 --> 24:34.883
Back up for a second.

24:34.884 --> 24:35.884
Who was shouting?

24:35.885 --> 24:37.352
I don't know, some guy.

24:37.353 --> 24:40.188
When I turned around,
he was holding the poor man up,

24:40.189 --> 24:41.824
Trying to get someone to notice.

24:41.825 --> 24:43.525
This guy must have got a
lot of blood on him, yeah?

24:43.526 --> 24:45.127
Yeah, sure, I guess.

24:45.128 --> 24:46.695
All right, thank you for your time.

24:46.696 --> 24:47.729
Officer.

24:47.730 --> 24:49.765
go ahead, emily.

24:49.766 --> 24:51.566
I found out where that blood trail ended.

24:51.567 --> 24:53.001
And?

24:53.002 --> 24:54.469
The unsub changed his clothes.

24:54.470 --> 24:56.471
He left his bloo
d-soaked ones here in the trash.

24:56.472 --> 24:58.672
He's avoided getting blood
on himself up to now.

24:58.673 --> 24:59.806
What changed?

24:59.807 --> 25:01.242
I don't know, but whatever his reason,

25:01.243 --> 25:02.310
He came prepared.

25:02.311 --> 25:05.713
He knew he would be bloody this time.

25:05.714 --> 25:08.382
I'll get back to you.

25:08.383 --> 25:09.449
What do you got, morgan?

25:09.450 --> 25:11.651
A witness says the first
responder, a citizen,

25:11.652 --> 25:13.786
Cried out for help maybe 2
seconds after the stabbing.

25:13.787 --> 25:15.521
He was the unsub.

25:15.522 --> 25:16.923
I think so.

25:16.924 --> 25:20.293
He's not content with revisiting
the crime scene anymore,

25:20.294 --> 25:22.228
He needs to be part of them.

25:22.229 --> 25:23.229
Detective!

25:23.230 --> 25:24.564
Yeah.

25:24.565 --> 25:26.232
Establish a perimeter around the market.

25:26.233 --> 25:28.067
Put your men no more an 20 feet apart.

25:28.068 --> 25:30.001
Every cop needs to be
in sight of one another.

25:30.002 --> 25:31.569
Whoa, wait a minute. What?

25:31.570 --> 25:33.170
Are you sure? The unsub is still here.

25:33.171 --> 25:35.472
Start by separating the men from the women.

25:35.473 --> 25:37.006
We found discarded clothes.
That's how we find him.

25:37.007 --> 25:38.674
We match by body type.

25:38.675 --> 25:41.209
All right, I'm on it. Gardella, come on.

25:42.211 --> 25:43.377
Copy that.

25:50.551 --> 25:52.451
Connor, is that you?

25:53.853 --> 25:55.020
Hey, liddy.

25:55.021 --> 25:56.022
What are you going?

25:56.023 --> 25:57.357
I gotta get back to the diner.

25:57.358 --> 25:58.925
Well, you're gonna be late.

25:58.926 --> 26:00.727
We gotta detain everyone inside here.

26:00.728 --> 26:02.395
Oh, come on. How many
hamburgers have let slide?

26:02.396 --> 26:04.564
Just following orders, buddy. Let's go.

26:06.200 --> 26:08.367
You gotta explain to sal when I'm late.

26:08.368 --> 26:10.469
Yeah, yeah, your customers won't starve.

26:39.055 --> 26:40.988
Those gotta be on the board, too?

26:40.989 --> 26:44.058
What's the next great bit
of advice from the fbi, huh?

26:44.059 --> 26:46.126
Take it easy, gardella.
This ain't the time or the place.

26:46.127 --> 26:48.728
If we hadn't listened to them, liddy and I
would be havg our morning cup of coffee.

26:48.729 --> 26:50.496
We profiled that he was mission oriented,

26:50.497 --> 26:52.665
And this kill doesn't fit that pattern.

26:52.666 --> 26:54.433
The murder of officer liddy
is a significant departure

26:54.434 --> 26:57.135
Even for someone as
unpredictable as this unsub.

26:57.136 --> 27:00.304
This was a murder of self-preservation,
just to get away.

27:00.305 --> 27:02.606
This location is not his m.O.,

27:02.607 --> 27:05.541
Secludedwith no audience,
stabbing, not cutting.

27:05.542 --> 27:06.609
So?

27:06.610 --> 27:08.210
So he's out prowling the streets right now

27:08.211 --> 27:11.280
Looking for another victim so the
city will pay atteion to him.

27:11.281 --> 27:13.416
You've been handed a list of locations

27:13.417 --> 27:15.451
That we think might be of
particular interest to the unsub.

27:15.452 --> 27:19.388
We're asking you to double and even
triple your surveillance in these areas.

27:19.389 --> 27:21.123
Keep your wits about you, guys.

27:21.124 --> 27:23.058
Detective, we'd like to speak to you.

27:23.059 --> 27:24.026
Sure.

27:24.027 --> 27:26.862
That's it, fellas. Thank you.

27:26.863 --> 27:29.865
Detective, the story has
become about officer liddy.

27:29.866 --> 27:32.534
We need to get the
attention back on the unsub

27:32.535 --> 27:34.403
Or we're afraid that he may lash out.

27:34.404 --> 27:36.972
Up till now, the unsub has
been disciplined enough

27:36.973 --> 27:38.807
To avoid killing if the
circumstances weren't right.

27:38.808 --> 27:41.309
Like an arsonist who won't set
a fire if there's someone there

27:41.310 --> 27:43.911
To see him leaving while smoke
is billowing out the windows.

27:43.912 --> 27:47.215
What if we say that one of
the buildings didn't burn?

27:47.216 --> 27:49.317
How would the unsub react to that?

27:49.318 --> 27:51.452
He'd be compelled to come
back and finish the job.

27:51.453 --> 27:53.921
Then we pick one of the previous locations,

27:53.922 --> 27:58.592
Show that the community
has rallied around it,

27:58.593 --> 28:00.060
So we need to find a location

28:00.061 --> 28:02.729
With the greatest symbolism
up to this point.

28:02.730 --> 28:04.530
That's easy.

28:05.332 --> 28:08.802
And we use the city's fallen hero

28:08.803 --> 28:10.370
As inspiration.

28:10.371 --> 28:12.972
Should we get the chief
of police or the mayor

28:12.973 --> 28:15.475
To make a statement?
It could help with inspiring people.

28:15.476 --> 28:16.909
We've got something better.

28:16.910 --> 28:19.745
Captain collins' widow.

28:19.746 --> 28:22.081
I--I cannot ask her to do that.

28:22.082 --> 28:23.716
She's highly visible, and she's someone

28:23.717 --> 28:26.118
With whom the entire city can sympathize.

28:26.119 --> 28:29.521
When she tells the city not to
be afraid to come back to church,

28:29.522 --> 28:31.857
The unsub can't ignore that.

28:31.858 --> 28:34.559
And what happens if this
draws the unsub to meg?

28:35.528 --> 28:37.762
We keep her with us.

28:37.763 --> 28:40.598
We'll take the bastard down.

28:44.569 --> 28:46.936
You want me to read this,

28:46.937 --> 28:48.438
In front of cameras?

28:48.439 --> 28:49.739
Yes.

28:50.741 --> 28:52.909
Will my husband's killer be there?

28:52.910 --> 28:55.078
Most likely he'll watch it on tv.

28:55.079 --> 28:58.648
You'll have police protection
around you at all times.

28:58.649 --> 29:01.417
No.

29:01.418 --> 29:02.919
I won't do it.

29:02.920 --> 29:04.655
Meg, please.

29:04.656 --> 29:05.956
We need you.

29:05.957 --> 29:07.458
You represent paul's memory.

29:07.459 --> 29:09.727
I represent sophia.

29:09.728 --> 29:11.796
Paul's given enough.

29:11.797 --> 29:13.631
So have I.

29:22.575 --> 29:23.775
Yes, sir.

29:23.776 --> 29:27.445
No, I understand. Thank you.

29:27.446 --> 29:29.680
That was the mayor. He won't
sign off on a press conference

29:29.681 --> 29:30.915
At st. Alvina.

29:30.916 --> 29:34.953
And jj couldn't make any
headway with meg collins.

29:36.455 --> 29:40.825
How long has it been since
officer liddy was stabbed?

29:40.826 --> 29:42.927
16 hours.

29:42.928 --> 29:45.796
Well, if the unsub was
going to go out on a spree,

29:45.797 --> 29:48.132
He would have done it by now. Why hasn't he?

29:48.133 --> 29:50.467
He killed a cop. He's laying low.

29:50.468 --> 29:53.403
May be. But we've profiled
this guy like an arsonist.

29:53.404 --> 29:56.206
It's the aftermath that matters,
not the act.

29:56.207 --> 29:59.710
You think he's feeding off the grief
of the police department instead?

29:59.711 --> 30:04.181
If so, then he's found
something new to get off on.

30:04.182 --> 30:05.482
Detective.

30:05.483 --> 30:06.616
Hold on a second. Yeah?

30:06.617 --> 30:08.485
I need a list of establishments

30:08.486 --> 30:09.819
Where your officers socialize--

30:09.820 --> 30:12.154
Bars, restaunts, pool halls,
everything you've got.

30:12.155 --> 30:14.356
Sure, right. Eddie, let me get back to you.

30:14.357 --> 30:15.323
Another round, guys?

30:15.324 --> 30:17.660
Yeah. We're off the clock anays.

30:17.661 --> 30:21.130
One more for liddy, boys.

30:30.407 --> 30:33.642
Here's to a great cop.

30:33.643 --> 30:37.179
We'll get this bastard for you,oe.

30:38.181 --> 30:40.650
Yeah, the fbi gonna help you do that?

30:42.085 --> 30:45.054
We don't need a profile to know
the kind of gu we're dealing with.

30:45.055 --> 30:46.689
A coward.

30:46.690 --> 30:48.923
He stabs a cop in the dark

30:48.924 --> 30:51.158
And runs away like a vermin.

30:51.159 --> 30:53.159
Gutless.

30:53.160 --> 30:55.462
No kiddin'.

30:55.463 --> 30:58.130
Comrades, I have amassed employment
records for police hangouts.

30:58.131 --> 30:59.365
What do you want me toook for?

30:59.366 --> 31:00.799
White males 25 to 30.

31:00.800 --> 31:02.067
I'm gonna need more than that.

31:02.068 --> 31:04.235
Arsonists typically have
a stronger relationship

31:04.236 --> 31:05.970
With their mothers than their fathers,

31:05.971 --> 31:07.771
So let's look for single-mother households

31:07.772 --> 31:10.807
With a history of abuse,
bad divorce, or paternal violence.

31:10.808 --> 31:13.676
Manifestations in the son, too, garcia,

31:13.677 --> 31:15.211
Like juvenile arrests, heavy crimes,

31:15.212 --> 31:16.812
A significant drop in grades.

31:16.813 --> 31:18.747
Thank you, boys. That will do.

31:21.884 --> 31:23.051
Oh, this looks like something.

31:23.052 --> 31:25.286
What do you have?

31:25.287 --> 31:27.254
Connor o'brien.

31:27.255 --> 31:29.457
His dad went to prison for--

31:29.458 --> 31:31.659
Oh, lordy--not only setting
mom's apartment on fire

31:31.660 --> 31:33.094
But making it look like it was an accident

31:33.095 --> 31:35.296
So he could collect on the insurance.

31:35.297 --> 31:37.197
Rned his kid's mother for a few bucks?

31:37.198 --> 31:40.067
Yeah. And then connor testified.

31:40.068 --> 31:41.034
He was 10.

31:41.035 --> 31:42.469
Where's o'brien now?

31:43.437 --> 31:46.105
He works at the quality cafe.

31:46.106 --> 31:48.741
Guys, it's across the street.

31:48.742 --> 31:50.775
Thanks, garcia.

31:52.078 --> 31:54.412
Where's connor o'brien? Fbi.

31:54.413 --> 31:56.481
Connie? He just stepped
out about 10 minutes ago.

31:56.482 --> 31:57.915
Did you see which way he went?

31:57.916 --> 31:59.617
He just went out to grab a smoke. Why

32:01.152 --> 32:02.886
Garcia, I need o'brien's home address.

32:02.887 --> 32:04.521
What are you guys doing here?

32:04.522 --> 32:05.923
We were done with our shifts.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.291
We poured one out for liddy.

32:07.292 --> 32:09.393
Did you talk to him about the recent mders?

32:09.394 --> 32:10.960
Of course. We said we'd catch the coward.

32:10.961 --> 32:12.461
You disparaged him.

32:12.462 --> 32:14.462
1121 admiral, apartment 16.

32:14.463 --> 32:16.264
It's the other side of town.

32:16.265 --> 32:19.567
Dave, you and morgan meet
prentiss and s.W.A.T. On site.

32:36.014 --> 32:37.681
Connor o'brien!

32:42.786 --> 32:44.120
Clear!

32:44.121 --> 32:47.256
He's not coming back here.

32:47.257 --> 32:48.924
He's gonna make his last stand.

32:48.925 --> 32:51.292
He's still gonna need to know
he's foremost on everyone's mind.

32:51.293 --> 32:52.460
Guys!

32:55.230 --> 32:58.031
It looks like he's got every
article that was printed

32:58.032 --> 32:59.299
About his mom's death.

32:59.300 --> 33:02.669
He has the prayer card from her funeral.

33:02.670 --> 33:04.972
Birthday cards.

33:04.973 --> 33:07.839
Look, all of them signed by his mom,
not by his father.

33:10.042 --> 33:12.643
Look at this.

33:12.644 --> 33:14.010
That's a lot of hate.

33:14.011 --> 33:16.079
His old man is already in prison.
He can't attack him.

33:16.080 --> 33:18.681
So he goes after the places
that remind him of his father.

33:18.682 --> 33:21.751
The only way he can get through
to his dad is with violence.

33:27.024 --> 33:29.859
William o'brien, aka billy os.

33:29.860 --> 33:32.562
Was a connected guy who specialized
in turning faulty wiring

33:32.563 --> 33:33.996
Into a 3-alarm fire.

33:33.997 --> 33:35.097
Because of connor's testimony,

33:35.098 --> 33:36.632
He was given a life sentence

33:36.633 --> 33:38.000
For the murder of his wife,

33:38.001 --> 33:39.335
But it was recently reduced

33:39.336 --> 33:41.537
To theossibility of parole in 5 years.

33:41.538 --> 33:42.938
When was the sentence reduced?

33:42.939 --> 33:43.906
One month ago.

33:43.907 --> 33:45.274
Just before the murders started.

33:45.275 --> 33:46.875
There's our stressor.

33:46.876 --> 33:50.045
Why would he do this to get back at
his father if he's already in jail?

33:50.046 --> 33:52.114
Somebody's gotta pay.

33:52.115 --> 33:53.982
He's a tough guy now.

34:03.958 --> 34:06.226
Hey, wake up.

34:06.227 --> 34:08.360
Wake up!

34:08.362 --> 34:11.331
Your mother's dead.

34:22.274 --> 34:23.739
Time to go.

34:23.741 --> 34:25.373
But, dad, you said I could--

34:25.375 --> 34:26.875
I said let's go!

34:32.347 --> 34:34.614
It's ok, honey.

34:34.616 --> 34:38.016
Just give me one more minute,
we'll be out of here.

34:53.060 --> 34:55.395
Yeah, thanks, eddie.

34:55.396 --> 34:56.762
Damn it.

34:58.732 --> 34:59.698
Where?

34:59.699 --> 35:01.066
Library about a mile from here.

35:01.067 --> 35:03.535
Mother was found next to her crying baby.

35:03.536 --> 35:04.869
Is the baby ok?

35:04.870 --> 35:06.704
Not a scratch, but they
haven't found the knife yet.

35:06.705 --> 35:09.073
It's his memento now.
He won't stop until he's killed

35:09.074 --> 35:10.374
As may people as possible.

35:10.375 --> 35:12.175
We have to go to our original plan--

35:12.176 --> 35:14.077
Create an event he can't resist coming to.

35:14.078 --> 35:16.045
He has to believe he was unsuccessful.

35:16.046 --> 35:18.214
If he won't go bk to his apartment,
and I don't think

35:18.215 --> 35:19.749
He's gonna revisit the crime scenes.

35:19.750 --> 35:22.350
The mother from the library?
She's already gone.

35:22.351 --> 35:24.886
She bled out at the scene.
The emts stopped working on her.

35:24.887 --> 35:26.921
Tell them to keep trying to resuscitate her.

35:26.922 --> 35:28.056
But she's dead.

35:28.057 --> 35:29.624
Yeah, but the unsub doesn't know that.

35:29.625 --> 35:32.593
Tell the press she made it,
she's hanging on for dear life.

35:32.594 --> 35:35.295
And we organize a candlelight
vigil for her tonight.

35:35.296 --> 35:37.665
If he's mission oriented and
he thinks she's still alive,

35:37.666 --> 35:39.099
He'll have to come back for her.

35:39.100 --> 35:40.067
And we'll be there.

35:40.068 --> 35:41.267
Let the husband know what's going on

35:41.268 --> 35:42.535
So he's aware.

35:42.536 --> 35:44.370
Have the press there. Tell them to go live

35:44.371 --> 35:46.906
And to keep the focus on
us as much as they can.

35:51.745 --> 35:53.078
Mrs. Collins.

35:59.349 --> 36:01.884
The woman who was just attacked...

36:01.885 --> 36:04.085
She was a mother?

36:05.054 --> 36:06.754
Yes.

36:07.723 --> 36:10.124
What can I do to help?

36:10.125 --> 36:11.726
We are live at the latest crime scene,

36:11.727 --> 36:14.795
Where the fbi is facilitating
what appears to be...

36:14.796 --> 36:16.863
Officer! Move this crowd to that corner

36:16.864 --> 36:18.398
And pin them behind the police barricades.

36:18.399 --> 36:19.866
We've got a female about 30,

36:19.867 --> 36:21.468
Her throat's been slashed, she's hanging on.

36:21.469 --> 36:23.669
There's a vascular surgeon
standing by at the hospital.

36:30.009 --> 36:31.710
Yeah, one, two is your change.

36:31.711 --> 36:33.178
Thank you.

36:40.785 --> 36:42.285
Can I help you?

36:42.286 --> 36:45.321
A pack of smokes.
Uh, c-could you turn that up?

36:46.657 --> 36:49.392
...Crime scene,
where the fbi is facilitating

36:49.393 --> 36:53.128
What appears to be a rescue
attempt of the most recent victim.

36:53.129 --> 36:55.264
They are rushing her into an ambulance now.

36:55.265 --> 36:56.298
Make some room, please!

36:56.299 --> 36:57.967
Right this way, guys.

36:57.968 --> 36:58.968
How's she doing?

36:58.969 --> 37:00.236
We've got her stabilized, sir.

37:00.237 --> 37:01.737
They're coming through. Please clear it out.

37:01.738 --> 37:04.307
Can we clear a path, please.

37:05.976 --> 37:08.210
Officers, I want a
5-car escort for the ambulance

37:08.211 --> 37:09.178
To the hospital.

37:09.179 --> 37:11.446
As you can see, she is still alive

37:11.447 --> 37:12.847
And being rushed to the hospital now.

37:12.848 --> 37:14.482
Looks like she's ok.

37:14.483 --> 37:16.518
No, no, that's im-- that's not possible.

37:16.519 --> 37:18.253
As many of you know,

37:18.254 --> 37:20.522
My husband captain paul collins

37:20.523 --> 37:23.358
Was murdered this past Sunday.

37:23.359 --> 37:27.395
The support I have received
has been inspiring.

37:27.396 --> 37:29.163
Which is why I'm asking everyone

37:29.164 --> 37:32.000
To support the latest victim, julia vecchia,

37:32.001 --> 37:35.336
Who is fighting for her life right
now at st. Frazier's hospital.

37:35.337 --> 37:36.971
It's that wife of the
soldier who got killed.

37:36.972 --> 37:38.305
On behalf of my husband,

37:38.306 --> 37:39.874
We are asking you to come together

37:39.875 --> 37:43.210
At st. Frazier's to hold a
candlelight vigil tonight.

37:43.211 --> 37:45.212
Please help restore this great city...

37:45.213 --> 37:48.015
Look at her. Kid's got a lot of heart.

37:48.016 --> 37:49.316
Thank you.

38:08.569 --> 38:10.570
You think this'll work?

38:10.571 --> 38:13.305
It should. We've shifted the public's focus

38:13.306 --> 38:14.673
From connor to his victim.

38:14.674 --> 38:16.341
That should make him angry enough to show up

38:16.342 --> 38:18.043
And try to do something about it.

38:36.862 --> 38:38.363
Connor o'brien?

38:38.364 --> 38:39.899
Roll in now. Go, go.

38:39.900 --> 38:42.735
Puyour hands where I can see
them and get down on the ground!

38:42.736 --> 38:44.270
Hey! Fbi!

38:45.172 --> 38:47.073
Stop right there!

38:49.076 --> 38:51.911
Stop! Moving! Stop fightg!

38:51.912 --> 38:53.312
Stop fighting!

38:53.313 --> 38:54.580
Stop!

38:54.581 --> 38:57.284
That's enough! It's over! That's enough!

38:57.285 --> 39:00.287
She's dead! There no possible
way she could have survived!

39:00.288 --> 39:02.489
Connor o'brien, you're under arrest.

39:02.490 --> 39:04.691
We know why you came down here.

39:04.692 --> 39:05.926
Do you?

39:05.927 --> 39:07.394
I had to make sure.

39:07.395 --> 39:10.630
She--she's dead, right?

39:10.631 --> 39:12.698
What are you smiling at?
You're going to jail.

39:12.699 --> 39:15.101
In jail they treat cop killers like kings.

39:15.102 --> 39:17.302
First you gotta see how we
treat 'em at the station.

39:17.303 --> 39:19.238
Get him out of here.

39:19.239 --> 39:21.373
Uhh!

39:31.317 --> 39:33.984
It's hard to believe that guy
was so starved for attention

39:33.985 --> 39:36.820
That he murdered all those
people just to one-up s father.

39:36.821 --> 39:40.190
I spokwith detective moreland
about connor's father billy os.

39:40.191 --> 39:44.861
He said the older police knew
to give him a wide berth.

39:44.862 --> 39:47.397
He didn't say much, but when he did...

39:47.398 --> 39:50.200
People listened.

39:50.201 --> 39:52.869
The adult version of a bully.

39:52.870 --> 39:55.873
There are lots of ways that
sons defeat their fathers.

39:55.874 --> 39:57.342
I just keep getting ph.D.S.

39:57.343 --> 40:00.345
Does the son of a sociopath
ever really have a chance?

40:00.346 --> 40:04.683
You know, o'brien committed his crimes
in the same jurisdiction as his father.

40:04.684 --> 40:08.019
It's only a matter of time before
he's put in the same prison.

41:54.825 --> 41:57.626
William shakespeare wrote,

41:57.627 --> 42:00.996

42:00.997 --> 42:03.398
"when a son gives to his father,

42:03.399 --> 42:06.234
Both cry."

42:07.904 --> 42:09.171
Hey, dad.

42:11.574 --> 42:13.875
Well, well, well.

42:13.876 --> 42:15.977
Does your mother know you're here?

42:18.514 --> 42:21.249
Uhh! Uhh! Aah! Uhh!
