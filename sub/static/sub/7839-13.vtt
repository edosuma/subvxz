00:25.877 --> 00:27.906
Checking out a cave 
is gonna be awesome!

00:28.004 --> 00:30.992
It'll be dark with rocks 
and mineral formations and

00:31.075 --> 00:34.152
plants that have adapted 
to harsh... wait a minute!

00:34.288 --> 00:35.156
This is a scam.

00:35.466 --> 00:36.936
We're on a nature walk!

00:37.937 --> 00:38.877
Don't worry, Bart.

00:38.906 --> 00:39.791
I brought something

00:39.803 --> 00:41.032
that'll keep you interested--

00:41.082 --> 00:42.863
a nickel in a water bottle!

00:48.610 --> 00:50.021
He'll sleep tonight.

00:51.140 --> 00:51.562
Where'd it go?!

00:51.630 --> 00:52.273
where'd it go?!

00:53.383 --> 00:54.287
It's in the cap.

00:56.816 --> 01:00.811
Local Anahoopi indians believed 
this stalactite

01:00.873 --> 01:05.706
was the finger of Tsisnajini, 
their god of pointing down.

01:06.564 --> 01:07.446
Silly indians.

01:07.766 --> 01:09.286
Our god made their god.

01:09.573 --> 01:11.302
It's so impressive.

01:11.317 --> 01:15.465
I'm just gonna get a tiny chip 
to put on my desk at work.

01:23.925 --> 01:26.334
Save me, Tsisnajini!

01:34.336 --> 01:35.194
I'm stuck!

01:35.369 --> 01:36.832
And I have to pee.

01:38.306 --> 01:39.154
Now I'm just stuck.

01:43.580 --> 01:44.822
Don't worry, Homer.

01:44.977 --> 01:48.431
We'll get that fireman who cut 
you out of that teacup ride.

01:48.849 --> 01:51.283
That was two firemen, 
a crane and snow white.

01:51.430 --> 01:52.732
Why you little...!

01:57.808 --> 01:59.913
This chamber's not on the map!

02:00.015 --> 02:03.311
We could be stuck in here forever 
if we don't find a way out!

02:03.361 --> 02:05.268
Well, we better start looking.

02:05.808 --> 02:06.597
Don't leave me!

02:06.805 --> 02:07.899
I hate to be alone!

02:07.997 --> 02:10.029
Except when I'm watching TV, 
then leave me alone.

02:10.132 --> 02:11.595
But right now, don't leave!

02:11.607 --> 02:12.968
I'll stay with you, dad.

02:13.016 --> 02:14.331
Will you tell me a story?

02:14.454 --> 02:15.048
Sure.

02:15.306 --> 02:17.298
Once upon a time, in a far-off kingdom...

02:17.322 --> 02:18.312
No unicorns.

02:19.368 --> 02:20.098
All right...

02:20.317 --> 02:22.979
I'll tell you something that 
happened to me last week.

02:22.979 --> 02:24.862
I was walking home from school...

02:24.997 --> 02:26.681
when suddenly I heard...

02:29.412 --> 02:31.112
Hello, Mr. Bighorn sheep!

02:33.918 --> 02:34.933
I've read about you.

02:35.119 --> 02:37.700
You're shy, and you rarely approach humans.

02:39.827 --> 02:44.202
And of course you'd never 
attack a fellow herbivore!

02:51.263 --> 02:52.849
Mad beast!

02:52.992 --> 02:54.221
Liberal midget!

02:58.655 --> 02:59.595
Good lord!

02:59.611 --> 03:00.815
A wooly bully!

03:03.798 --> 03:04.893
Run! Run!

03:05.924 --> 03:06.932
Come on.

03:12.426 --> 03:13.558
Enter password.

03:13.751 --> 03:14.917
Damn it! I forget!

03:14.978 --> 03:16.149
Forgot password?

03:16.336 --> 03:17.631
Enter place of birth.

03:17.651 --> 03:19.793
Pangaea.

03:19.974 --> 03:23.106
Correct. Your password has 
been e-mailed to you.

03:31.673 --> 03:33.508
So long, sucker!

03:34.093 --> 03:37.231
I mean, don't leave an old man to die.

03:38.157 --> 03:39.558
So long, sucker!

03:54.533 --> 03:55.726
Maybe Mr. Smithers

03:55.763 --> 03:56.550
will help us.

03:56.636 --> 03:58.848
No, he's out getting a spray-on tan.

03:59.112 --> 04:01.392
He comes back orange and stains the furniture.

04:01.436 --> 04:03.114
The man's a walking creamsicle!

04:05.725 --> 04:07.680
You worked at Moe's?

04:07.815 --> 04:11.713
Yes... and therein lies a 
tale of woe and heartbreak.

04:11.823 --> 04:14.134
One I couldn't possibly recount.

04:14.220 --> 04:15.189
I understand.

04:15.250 --> 04:16.704
I'll just read a magazine.

04:17.010 --> 04:18.315
Okay, here's the story:

04:18.334 --> 04:20.607
I belong to a very exclusive club,

04:20.975 --> 04:22.894
the excluders' club.

04:23.525 --> 04:26.965
One day, while I was savoring 
the exclusivity...

04:27.047 --> 04:28.309
Wait, wait, wait, wait...

04:28.342 --> 04:31.337
Now you're telling me Burns's story?

04:31.515 --> 04:33.905
Yeah it's like the play within a play in Hamlet.

04:34.519 --> 04:35.244
Let's see...

04:35.258 --> 04:38.602
it's like when you watch old 
home movies of you watching TV.

04:38.664 --> 04:39.746
Gotcha.

04:41.536 --> 04:43.712
One day a new member arrived at the club...

04:43.868 --> 04:48.259
Who's this dried-up ol' apricot?

04:50.632 --> 04:51.579
I'm in oil.

04:51.628 --> 04:52.931
What's your racket, slim?

04:53.090 --> 04:54.436
Nuclear power.

04:54.738 --> 04:57.492
I make money using my brain, not sticking a

04:57.553 --> 05:00.147
pole in the ground and praying for goo.

05:01.402 --> 05:04.675
You need to get your 
hands dirty, poindexter!

05:04.839 --> 05:07.281
Dip 'em in a little Texas crude!

05:08.302 --> 05:12.486
Down in Houston, we call 
that a fort worth shampoo!

05:13.549 --> 05:16.423
Sir, I challenge you to a duel!

05:16.799 --> 05:17.717
You got it!

05:17.937 --> 05:20.420
A bullet in the brain at high noon!

05:22.938 --> 05:24.739
At my age, that could kill me!

05:25.089 --> 05:27.302
How about we settle things 
with a scavenger hunt?

05:27.413 --> 05:29.122
You're on, twiggy!

05:29.417 --> 05:30.769
Sorry 'bout that.

05:31.369 --> 05:33.520
Gentlemen, you will each be given

05:33.533 --> 05:35.780
an identical list of ten items.

05:36.032 --> 05:39.684
The first person to collect all items on said list

05:39.721 --> 05:44.646
is the winner, and shall receive all 
of his opponent's worldly possessions.

05:46.228 --> 05:48.726
I'm gonna win me a nucular plant!

05:48.984 --> 05:50.703
Dream on, bitch.

05:55.153 --> 05:56.039
Scavengers...

05:56.425 --> 05:57.388
scavenge!

06:12.858 --> 06:14.259
I'm bald!

06:19.205 --> 06:22.221
I had but one item left on the list...

06:22.435 --> 06:24.892
a picture of myself with a smiling child.

06:26.193 --> 06:27.547
what could be easier?

06:29.758 --> 06:31.834
It's the boogeyman's grandfather!

06:32.731 --> 06:34.111
He's gonna drink our bones!

06:34.524 --> 06:36.174
Smile! Like this!

06:45.570 --> 06:46.357
I won!

06:46.529 --> 06:48.646
Everything yours is mine!

06:50.889 --> 06:53.500
Hiyo, Smithers! Away!

06:56.412 --> 06:57.949
With nowhere else to turn,

06:57.961 --> 07:00.409
I spent the first three days with relatives.

07:02.297 --> 07:03.371
I had to get a job.

07:03.735 --> 07:05.543
And I had to start at the bottom.

07:05.567 --> 07:09.535
But to get to the bottom, I had 
to work my way up from Moe.

07:11.886 --> 07:14.193
Hey, bar-boy, this table's wobbly.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.918
Come jam your foot under it.

07:17.379 --> 07:19.161
sHey, bar-boy, write a play where I meet

07:19.210 --> 07:21.000
Henry Ford and captain Kirk.

07:21.538 --> 07:23.917
Hey, bar-boy, dance around like an idiot.

07:23.948 --> 07:24.918
Like this!

07:25.042 --> 07:26.592
I'm so stupid!

07:26.715 --> 07:28.178
I'm so stupid!

07:28.293 --> 07:29.608
I'm a little busy.

07:29.817 --> 07:30.633
Can I do it later?

07:30.727 --> 07:31.330
Sure!

07:32.381 --> 07:34.563
You're gonna be all I'm so stupid!

07:34.612 --> 07:36.117
I'm so stupid!

07:36.201 --> 07:37.747
I'm so stupid!"

07:39.902 --> 07:42.312
Burns sure will look like a jerk later!

07:42.736 --> 07:45.404
At $5.15 an hour, it would take an eternity

07:45.404 --> 07:46.592
to make my fortune back...

07:46.645 --> 07:48.274
and fica wasn't helping.

07:49.865 --> 07:54.235
But then, for once in my life, 
things went my way.

07:58.881 --> 08:01.655
I steamed the letter open 
with Moe's cappuccino machine.

08:02.314 --> 08:04.279
If you're reading this, I am dead,

08:04.470 --> 08:08.442
and you are about to learn 
the story of my treasure.

08:08.500 --> 08:09.093
Treasure?!

08:09.453 --> 08:10.327
Treasure?!

08:10.675 --> 08:12.871
Moe has a cappuccino machine?!

08:17.140 --> 08:19.081
we couldn't find a way out.

08:19.409 --> 08:23.040
But on the up side, I found some 
cave paintings and made them awesome.

08:25.534 --> 08:27.600
Boy, come here and listen to Lisa's story.

08:27.806 --> 08:29.913
It's about Moe's treasure.

08:31.580 --> 08:32.937
So to contin...

08:33.062 --> 08:33.448
...ue with

08:33.520 --> 08:34.563
the sad sto...

08:34.659 --> 08:36.235
...Ry of Moe's treasure.

08:36.448 --> 08:38.097
It was the first day of summer.

08:39.812 --> 08:41.815
I was heading to the restaurant supply store

08:41.903 --> 08:45.064
to buy some urinal cake mix 
when I was suddenly sideswiped....

08:45.565 --> 08:46.369
by love.

08:49.621 --> 08:53.034
There she was, the gorgeous new 
girl in town, Edna Krabappel.

08:56.022 --> 08:57.399
You poor man.

08:57.500 --> 09:00.034
She had gossamer hair, limpid eyes

09:00.148 --> 09:01.442
and the rack of an angel.

09:03.184 --> 09:04.353
I see you're new to town.

09:04.410 --> 09:05.933
Maybe I could show you around.

09:05.975 --> 09:07.425
I know a terrific tavern.

09:08.173 --> 09:09.957
My ex-husband was a drunk.

09:10.073 --> 09:15.113
I hate bars, saloons, nightclubs, 
and most of all, taverns.

09:15.164 --> 09:16.291
Yeah, me, too.

09:16.316 --> 09:18.298
That's why I'm not a tavern keeper.

09:18.528 --> 09:19.853
What do you do for a living?

09:19.988 --> 09:20.958
Me? Well...

09:21.020 --> 09:21.980
I, for a living?

09:22.038 --> 09:25.221
Well, there's, all kinds of 
things a fella can do,

09:25.252 --> 09:28.038
such as hemming and hawing and, but me,

09:28.099 --> 09:29.769
I'm a highly respected...

09:29.925 --> 09:31.251
therapist for alcoholics.

09:31.594 --> 09:32.804
Wow.

09:36.015 --> 09:37.789
I knew that in order to win her love

09:37.867 --> 09:40.017
I needed to get rid of the human garbage

09:40.030 --> 09:42.106
otherwise known as my best friends.

09:44.380 --> 09:45.038
Get out of my...

09:45.211 --> 09:45.816
come on!

09:48.406 --> 09:50.211
Barney, how do you keep getting back in?

09:50.256 --> 09:51.049
I'm a drunk.

09:51.081 --> 09:54.075
I don't know nothing about how I do anything.

09:57.943 --> 10:04.569
Fly me to the moon let me play among the stars

10:05.099 --> 10:07.645
for one sweet summer, I was a true gentleman.

10:07.804 --> 10:10.830
As a result of which, Krabappel was letting me do her.

10:11.335 --> 10:14.382
So, Mrs. Krabappel, you got any plans?

10:14.445 --> 10:18.556
In the fall, I'll be teaching fourth 
grade at Springfield elementary.

10:18.623 --> 10:19.270
That's great.

10:19.437 --> 10:20.635
Wonderful bunch of kids.

10:21.823 --> 10:25.016
Lab partners don't treat 
lab partners like this!

10:25.036 --> 10:26.966
Shut up and attract lightning.

10:30.989 --> 10:33.191
Edna, you've made me feel love

10:33.219 --> 10:35.055
where before there was only pain.

10:35.151 --> 10:36.361
Come here, you.

10:39.443 --> 10:40.507
Oh, geez.

10:40.679 --> 10:43.601
Hey, Moe. Thanks to you, I've been sober a week.

10:43.628 --> 10:44.473
Yeah, me, too!

10:44.492 --> 10:45.420
We're all sober.

10:45.839 --> 10:48.375
These are some of the local 
alcoholics I told you about.

10:48.484 --> 10:49.664
Don't pigeonhole us.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.109
We have other vices.

10:51.212 --> 10:52.637
I dress up like a baby.

10:54.255 --> 10:56.801
Come on, guys, let me give you 
some counseling over here.

10:57.682 --> 11:00.187
Listen, boozebags, I got a 
good thing going here.

11:00.425 --> 11:02.835
If you mess it up, I will out 
the one of you that is gay.

11:05.933 --> 11:07.519
So, where were we?

11:11.656 --> 11:13.493
I had to get Edna out of Springfield,

11:13.680 --> 11:15.881
make a fresh start in a new town far away,

11:16.188 --> 11:18.619
a place where we can play 
bridge with our neighbors.

11:18.734 --> 11:21.583
And if they're interested in 
wife-swapping, who am I to say no?

11:21.660 --> 11:22.808
Hey, I'm just the new guy.

11:23.326 --> 11:25.601
But where would I get the 
money to start a new life?

11:25.828 --> 11:28.791
And then opportunity strolled 
right in the door.

11:32.182 --> 11:36.325
Yes, well, I need directions to the 
Springfield natural history museum.

11:37.032 --> 11:39.087
I totally have a donation for them.

11:40.680 --> 11:42.453
Coins money gold!

11:42.716 --> 11:46.013
See, this was back before snake 
became a notorious jailbird,

11:46.149 --> 11:49.592
when he was an idealisc, 
law-abiding young archaeologist.

11:49.795 --> 11:52.164
I was, like, excavating this mayan pyramid,

11:52.210 --> 11:55.111
and I totally unearth these 
gold coins, and I'm all like,

11:55.424 --> 11:57.709
could you be any more pre-columbian?

11:58.133 --> 12:00.105
You can't donate that gold to the museum today,

12:00.219 --> 12:02.713
because, it's closed, so they can clean

12:02.714 --> 12:04.736
under the wangs on the statues.

12:05.729 --> 12:07.534
Well, no problem. I'll just spend the night

12:07.559 --> 12:09.411
in that motel across the street there.

12:10.389 --> 12:12.259
Love had handed me an awful dilemma.

12:12.366 --> 12:15.129
Should I rob this guy or rob him and kill him?

12:15.731 --> 12:17.359
I decided to do the right thing.

12:28.180 --> 12:29.422
I've been robbed!

12:29.605 --> 12:31.995
I'll take my revenge on society...

12:32.057 --> 12:34.081
by which, I mean convenience stores.

12:34.192 --> 12:37.656
And who would suspect me, professor Jailbird?!

12:41.784 --> 12:44.632
Before we left town for good, 
we had to make one stop,

12:44.819 --> 12:47.386
so she could tell the school 
she wouldn't be teaching there.

12:47.647 --> 12:50.715
Back in a flash, my sweet little gargoyle!

12:55.674 --> 12:57.761
I was the happiest guy in the world.

12:58.056 --> 13:01.990
But fate likes to play a little 
game called up yours, Moe.

13:02.965 --> 13:04.624
Moe, we need to talk.

13:04.851 --> 13:07.465
About what? How nothing changed 
when you were in there?

13:07.541 --> 13:08.585
Not exactly.

13:08.750 --> 13:10.993
You see, when I went inside...

13:13.717 --> 13:15.230
Young man, it's summertime.

13:15.335 --> 13:16.567
What are you doing here?

13:16.628 --> 13:18.225
I've got detention all summer.

13:18.381 --> 13:19.299
Why?

13:19.653 --> 13:21.062
Because I'm a screwup.

13:21.318 --> 13:22.873
My sister's the smart one.

13:23.021 --> 13:24.502
All I do is get in trouble.

13:25.340 --> 13:27.426
Sweetheart, do you want to do better?

13:27.644 --> 13:29.199
It doesn't matter.

13:29.378 --> 13:31.246
Everyone's pretty much given up on me.

13:31.612 --> 13:34.158
I bet I won't even make it 
through fourth grade.

13:37.325 --> 13:39.485
You'lle it through fourth grade,

13:39.592 --> 13:41.995
because I'm going to stay 
here and be your teacher.

13:42.203 --> 13:43.539
Wait, wait, wait.

13:43.667 --> 13:46.296
There's one thing I don't understand here.

13:46.403 --> 13:48.771
You never had detention all summer.

13:49.190 --> 13:50.484
That load of crap?

13:51.540 --> 13:54.690
No, I was just keeping her busy 
while Nelson stole microscopes.

13:54.770 --> 13:55.630
Make with the story.

13:56.160 --> 13:57.810
Well, my best recollection of 
Burns' paraphrasing

13:57.810 --> 14:01.800
of what he read in moe's letter 
is that Krabappel told Moe...

14:02.180 --> 14:04.130
I have to stay here in Springfield, because boys

14:04.130 --> 14:06.060
like Bart Simpson need me...

14:06.450 --> 14:09.700
sweet, misunderstood boys, who 
just need someone to recognize

14:09.700 --> 14:12.560
the basic goodness that's trapped inside them

14:12.910 --> 14:14.680
and is desperately trying to get out.

14:17.360 --> 14:18.730
There was nothing I could do.

14:19.430 --> 14:20.860
Well, except go nuts.

14:21.520 --> 14:22.370
You crazy skirt!

14:22.490 --> 14:24.560
Nobody backs out on fake good Moe!

14:24.650 --> 14:26.550
I ought to...!

14:26.640 --> 14:28.390
why do you all...!

14:34.110 --> 14:41.690
in other words I love...

14:42.710 --> 14:44.690
If I couldn't spend the treasure on Edna,

14:44.690 --> 14:45.870
I didn't want to spend it.

14:46.010 --> 14:49.070
I just sat there playing our song on the jukebox,

14:49.380 --> 14:52.150
one gold... coin at a time."

14:54.440 --> 14:55.480
Oh, you poor man.

14:55.990 --> 14:58.700
You're about to get a lot poorer.

15:05.390 --> 15:08.430
okay, I'll take your gold and give you back all

15:08.430 --> 15:10.010
your worldly possessions,

15:10.270 --> 15:12.280
'ceptin' your nucular plant.

15:12.700 --> 15:15.150
You don't get that back till you bring me

15:15.150 --> 15:17.990
a photo of yourself with a smiling child.

15:19.410 --> 15:21.360
what the hell could that mean to you?

15:21.430 --> 15:22.960
I'm obsessive-compulsive!

15:24.470 --> 15:25.320
One, two, three, four.

15:26.340 --> 15:27.210
One, two, three, four.

15:28.330 --> 15:29.210
One, two, three, four.

15:31.100 --> 15:33.800
No nucular plant without a photo.

15:33.850 --> 15:34.700
One, two, three, four.

15:34.810 --> 15:35.960
That's where we left off.

15:36.040 --> 15:36.780
One, two, three, four.

15:37.160 --> 15:39.930
So, without my beloved nuclear plant,

15:40.320 --> 15:42.460
I have nothing to live for.

15:49.800 --> 15:53.570
Take me, a barren old thistle, 
and spare this sweet young flower.

16:04.980 --> 16:06.210
My pearl necklace.

16:06.300 --> 16:09.120
I must have lost it, and you 
were just bringing it back to me?

16:12.640 --> 16:13.910
How did you find this?

16:25.360 --> 16:26.770
The sheep was no danger at all.

16:27.030 --> 16:29.660
I sacrificed my gorgeous body for nothing.

16:29.850 --> 16:31.690
This must be what it's like to have a baby.

16:31.860 --> 16:35.700
I want a photo of the hero who 
risked his life to save me.

16:43.760 --> 16:46.370
A picture of me with a smiling child.

16:46.430 --> 16:48.410
I can get my plant back!

16:51.370 --> 16:53.180
100 industrial way!

16:54.680 --> 16:57.360
Mr. Burns got his plant back, and I like to think

16:57.360 --> 17:00.330
I found a shred of humanity in his withered soul.

17:01.400 --> 17:04.050
Dad, did my story make you cry?

17:06.220 --> 17:08.920
Well, it was very moving, but the thing is,

17:09.230 --> 17:11.680
bats are chewing my legs!

17:17.950 --> 17:21.230
Why did I lead you down here 
to find those stupid coins?

17:25.530 --> 17:28.520
Homer, you brought us to this 
horrible place on purpose?

17:29.110 --> 17:30.650
You didn't think it was so horrible

17:30.650 --> 17:32.480
when you were falling down the hole.

17:32.570 --> 17:34.820
That was the most horrible part of all!

17:35.010 --> 17:36.640
Well, I guess I should explain.

17:36.800 --> 17:39.650
Not long ago, it was my day 
to take care of the baby,

17:39.920 --> 17:41.920
so I was out in the forest, hiding.

17:44.080 --> 17:48.310
The yellow gold of texas is what I want to save

17:48.580 --> 17:52.300
I will not pay no taxes if I hide it in a cave.

17:52.900 --> 17:58.220
I deduced from his parody lyrics 
that he was hiding gold in the cave.

18:00.750 --> 18:03.090
I figured he'd never miss two or three pieces...

18:03.290 --> 18:06.190
money which we could use to 
pay for Bart's operation.

18:07.010 --> 18:08.080
I need an operation?

18:08.280 --> 18:10.400
That's a story for another day.

18:11.120 --> 18:13.990
I realized I could never find 
the gold without your help,

18:14.320 --> 18:16.820
so I made it this week's family outing.

18:17.200 --> 18:20.250
I'll take that gold, if'n you please.

18:20.390 --> 18:21.480
How can you take it?

18:21.560 --> 18:22.770
We haven't found it.

18:23.270 --> 18:25.000
It's right there behind that rock.

18:25.690 --> 18:26.620
No, to your left.

18:27.540 --> 18:30.880
Texas left, which is your "down."

18:33.880 --> 18:36.920
I'll take that gold, if'n you please.

18:37.470 --> 18:39.870
Not so fast, shady Bird Johnson!

18:40.560 --> 18:42.200
I'll take that gold.

18:42.370 --> 18:43.210
Yeah, you'll take it.

18:43.360 --> 18:45.910
And then you'll give it to me, 
if you know what's good for ya.

18:47.030 --> 18:48.230
you guys have guns?

18:48.440 --> 18:49.660
Well, so do I.

18:54.820 --> 18:56.990
Coolest entrance gets the gold.

18:59.800 --> 19:01.870
Is it okay that I brought my son?

19:01.870 --> 19:03.080
This is my day with him.

19:03.270 --> 19:05.330
Jeremy, there's a boy over 
there you can play with.

19:06.720 --> 19:07.690
Do you like XBox?

19:08.740 --> 19:11.790
Looks like we got us a mexican standoff.

19:30.950 --> 19:34.650
If you all don't drop your guns 
and behave, no one gets the gold.

19:36.090 --> 19:38.480
And why do you really want it anyway?

19:38.610 --> 19:41.720
Moe, will the gold bring back Edna's love?

19:41.840 --> 19:43.220
It could. Definitely.

19:43.450 --> 19:48.470
Mr. Burns, isn't it more important 
that you got a child to smile at you?

19:48.620 --> 19:51.070
Honestly, no, I'd rather have the gold.

19:51.220 --> 19:51.950
Absolutely.

19:51.950 --> 19:53.340
I couldn't agree more.

19:53.450 --> 19:55.900
I can see there's only one way to

19:55.900 --> 19:58.240
turn you into human beings again.

20:02.200 --> 20:06.780
Lady, I oughta fill you full of... gratitude!

20:07.920 --> 20:10.540
That gold was turning us into monsters.

20:10.790 --> 20:13.720
Well, I know a place where 
we can atone for our misdeeds.

20:14.010 --> 20:16.200
They're building a youth center in Shelbyville

20:16.200 --> 20:18.050
and totally need volunteers.

20:18.280 --> 20:19.860
Let's go there now!

20:20.120 --> 20:21.330
Yes, let's.

20:21.970 --> 20:24.040
I'll...I'll catch up with you.

20:27.860 --> 20:31.660
And that's why I didn't have time 
to study for my geography test.

20:31.850 --> 20:33.670
Bart, do you expect me to believe that?

20:33.720 --> 20:35.630
That story is the biggest load of...

20:35.990 --> 20:37.050
Krabappel?

20:37.200 --> 20:38.290
Making out with Moe?

20:40.880 --> 20:43.010
But I thought you didn't want 
to date a tavern owner.

20:43.300 --> 20:46.070
At this point, all I want's 
a man with a healthy libido.

20:47.160 --> 20:49.240
Well, this is where it gets awkward again.

20:51.690 --> 20:53.180
Moe can't catch a break!

20:53.280 --> 20:54.100
One, two, three, four.

20:54.290 --> 20:55.110
Can't catch a break.

20:55.340 --> 20:56.120
One, two, three, four.

20:56.170 --> 20:57.040
Can't catch a break.

20:57.180 --> 20:58.010
One, two, three, four.

20:58.340 --> 20:59.750
And there's some producers.

21:00.110 --> 21:01.890
One, two, three, four.

21:02.640 --> 21:03.150
Four producers.
