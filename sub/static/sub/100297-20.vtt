WEBVTT

00:03.705 --> 00:08.450
Mm. Tell you what, these pot
shop numbers are really good.

00:08.452 --> 00:11.476
I'll bet it's the only thing
these stoners can remember.

00:11.478 --> 00:14.246
"Hey, where'd you put your car, man?

00:15.240 --> 00:18.783
Wait a minute. We got to buy more weed".

00:18.785 --> 00:21.012
There is something
else I got to tell you,

00:21.014 --> 00:23.171
but I don't want this to get out.

00:23.173 --> 00:25.432
You're not a complete idiot.

00:26.326 --> 00:28.251
Oh, my God, are you dying?

00:28.253 --> 00:32.421
No, but I didn't like
how excited you just got.

00:32.423 --> 00:34.941
I'm kidding. I don't want you to die.

00:34.943 --> 00:37.635
- Not anymore.
- Yeah.

00:37.637 --> 00:39.664
Hey, honey.

00:39.666 --> 00:42.189
You and your vlog made Denver's list

00:42.191 --> 00:44.379
of Top Ten Online Personalities again.

00:44.381 --> 00:46.265
See? Look. Congratulations.

00:47.360 --> 00:48.675
What?

00:48.677 --> 00:50.844
I said congratulations.

00:50.846 --> 00:52.406
I know, I just wanted to hear it again.

00:53.749 --> 00:56.275
Oh, hey, uh, any mention
of Ry-Ry and Ky-Ky,

00:56.277 --> 00:58.227
the Sci-Fi Guy-Guys?

00:58.229 --> 00:59.704
Uh, oh, yes, yes.

00:59.706 --> 01:03.708
Your podcast got Most Rhyming Name.

01:03.710 --> 01:06.735
No, no, you didn't get
mentioned, Ryan. No.

01:06.737 --> 01:08.212
We just can't get any traction.

01:08.214 --> 01:10.456
I mean, nerds love
sci-fi and the Internet.

01:10.458 --> 01:11.740
What am I missing?

01:11.742 --> 01:12.933
You're boring.

01:12.935 --> 01:14.743
Mike.

01:14.745 --> 01:17.204
Not him personally.
The podcast is boring,

01:17.206 --> 01:19.724
and you're just the
face of that boredom.

01:20.635 --> 01:22.543
What Mike is trying to say is,

01:22.545 --> 01:24.970
if you want to get noticed,
you got to make some noise.

01:24.972 --> 01:27.640
You bring on a name guest,
create some conflict...

01:27.642 --> 01:30.902
Wow. You are red hot when you
repeat things I've told you.

01:30.904 --> 01:32.553
Mm.

01:32.555 --> 01:35.227
You're saying we don't create
enough conflict on the podcast?

01:35.229 --> 01:38.007
No, no, not really.
Right now, you and Kyle

01:38.009 --> 01:40.108
are just two nice guys who
always agree with each other.

01:40.110 --> 01:41.952
Right, you got to get
alternate points of view.

01:41.954 --> 01:44.106
You know, get the audience
invested in picking a side.

01:44.108 --> 01:45.308
It's basic storytelling.

01:45.310 --> 01:47.251
Mike, I think I know
how to tell a story.

01:47.253 --> 01:48.920
You do, huh? Well, here's one.

01:48.922 --> 01:51.412
This guy had a boring podcast,
didn't take advice,

01:51.414 --> 01:53.706
it sucked, end of story.

01:55.251 --> 01:57.571
Oh, oh, that was fascinating.

01:57.573 --> 01:59.736
I-I was on the edge of my seat.

01:59.738 --> 02:01.642
Oh, okay, so what you're saying is,

02:01.644 --> 02:04.444
we need a guest that's
contrarian and opinionated

02:04.446 --> 02:07.164
- and loves to hear himself talk.
- Mm, yeah,

02:07.166 --> 02:10.090
preferably, someone who already
has an Internet presence

02:10.092 --> 02:12.243
- Oh.
- who might bring in some new listeners,

02:12.245 --> 02:14.454
and he's also a sweetheart.

02:15.934 --> 02:18.935
Wait. I... I see where this is going.

02:18.937 --> 02:21.628
Listen, you know I've always said that,

02:21.630 --> 02:22.921
- Mm-hmm.
- uh, podcasts are so boring,

02:22.923 --> 02:25.942
no one with any
self-respect would do it.

02:25.944 --> 02:27.351
But?

02:27.353 --> 02:30.112
Uh, still the same.

02:32.138 --> 02:35.138
- Synced and corrected by<font color="#00BFFF"> Firefly</font> -
- <font color="#00ffff">www.addic7ed.com</font> -

02:40.107 --> 02:41.107
What?

02:43.035 --> 02:46.445
I don't want to do a podcast
with a bunch of sci-fi nerds.

02:46.447 --> 02:50.633
They'll probably just call in,
ask, "Hey, what are girls like?"

02:50.635 --> 02:52.117
Oh, uh-huh. Yeah.

02:52.119 --> 02:54.328
Well, that's totally understandable.

02:54.330 --> 02:56.213
I mean, I get it, I get it.

02:56.215 --> 02:57.497
There's nothing to get.

02:57.499 --> 02:59.642
Podcast, sci-fi, Ryan?

02:59.644 --> 03:03.020
It's the trifecta of useless things.

03:06.008 --> 03:07.799
What?

03:07.801 --> 03:11.153
I think it's nice how close
you and Ryan are getting.

03:11.155 --> 03:15.467
I think it's nice that
you say such crazy things.

03:15.469 --> 03:17.975
I've been married to you for 30 years.

03:17.977 --> 03:20.173
- I always know what you're thinking.
- You know what?

03:20.175 --> 03:22.573
Remind me to buy a
lead helmet. You know...

03:22.575 --> 03:26.911
Alexa, add "lead helmet"
to my shopping list.

03:26.913 --> 03:30.197
Okay. I've added "lead
helmet" to your shopping list.

03:30.199 --> 03:31.841
Huh.

03:31.843 --> 03:35.202
And now you're making
jokes to try to distract me.

03:35.204 --> 03:36.703
Is it working?

03:36.705 --> 03:38.705
No.

03:38.707 --> 03:40.257
You know...

03:40.259 --> 03:44.002
you like how your relationship
is with Ryan right now,

03:44.004 --> 03:46.022
and you don't want to do
anything to screw that up.

03:46.024 --> 03:47.765
I mean, that's why you're a sweetheart.

03:47.767 --> 03:49.600
Okay, all right, I admit it.

03:49.602 --> 03:51.236
I like not arguing with the man

03:51.238 --> 03:53.029
that's gonna give me
my second grandchild.

03:53.031 --> 03:55.197
Mm-hmm, and you don't
want to go on his podcast

03:55.199 --> 03:57.214
because you're afraid you
might get into a fight,

03:57.216 --> 03:58.684
and that will screw things up.

03:58.686 --> 04:00.778
It's not gonna be a fight.

04:00.780 --> 04:02.854
I'll rip his head off.
He'll never recover.

04:02.856 --> 04:05.524
I am just too powerful.

04:05.526 --> 04:07.126
Okay.

04:08.160 --> 04:10.379
I know that it would mean a lot

04:10.381 --> 04:12.364
to Ryan if you did his show.

04:12.366 --> 04:15.242
Isn't it enough that I just
give him a pot shop to run

04:15.244 --> 04:17.053
and he gets to marry my oldest daughter?

04:17.055 --> 04:19.245
Let me... let me tell you a story, okay?

04:19.248 --> 04:21.873
Once upon a time there
was a very nice man

04:21.875 --> 04:23.801
who wanted to help out his son-in-law,

04:23.803 --> 04:26.971
so he called him and he
said he'd do his podcast.

04:26.973 --> 04:28.375
I don't like the
beginning of that story,

04:28.377 --> 04:31.354
the middle or the end of that story.

04:34.763 --> 04:35.974
Oh, excuse me.

04:35.976 --> 04:38.205
Um, can we get some menus
when you get a chance, please?

04:38.207 --> 04:40.063
Oh, I'm so sorry. Most people just read

04:40.065 --> 04:42.908
the giant chalkboard, but...
let me see what I can do.

04:45.899 --> 04:48.108
Wow. Didn't notice the giant chalkboard,

04:48.110 --> 04:50.586
- but Trevor sure is a giant as...
- Okay, Mandy.

04:50.588 --> 04:52.779
We're-we're having a nice lunch.

04:52.781 --> 04:55.332
If this booth seems small to me,

04:55.334 --> 04:57.334
what are you guys going through?

04:57.336 --> 04:59.619
Well, I told them there
would be four of us.

04:59.621 --> 05:03.248
Yeah, did you tell them
that one of us was two of us?

05:03.250 --> 05:05.250
Maybe we should take turns.

05:05.252 --> 05:07.961
Three of us eat while one of us watches.

05:07.963 --> 05:10.922
Then we rotate. Like volleyball.

05:10.924 --> 05:13.592
Aw. You know this is fun, this is fun.

05:13.594 --> 05:16.237
- It's like eating lunch in the backseat of a car.
- Yeah.

05:17.297 --> 05:20.245
Uh, excuse me. Could
we get a larger table?

05:20.247 --> 05:21.769
My daughter's pregnant, and...

05:21.771 --> 05:23.937
Oh. My sister was pregnant once.

05:23.939 --> 05:26.189
- Aw.
- She stayed home.

05:27.700 --> 05:29.983
This guy is incredibly rude.

05:29.985 --> 05:33.612
Nothing an elbow to the face can't cure.

05:33.614 --> 05:36.948
Kristin, you look uncomfortable.
Do you want to switch with me?

05:36.950 --> 05:39.207
Good idea. Yeah. I'll
probably be making, uh,

05:39.209 --> 05:41.661
several trips to the bathroom, so...

05:41.663 --> 05:42.805
Okay.

05:43.808 --> 05:45.716
- Oh!
- Oh! Uh, sorry.

05:45.718 --> 05:47.551
Okay, okay...

05:47.553 --> 05:49.002
Sorry.

05:49.004 --> 05:50.670
Baby on the way.

05:50.672 --> 05:53.057
No, oh, no, no, not now.

05:53.059 --> 05:55.776
Soon. Soon. We're... we're excited.

05:57.137 --> 05:59.563
Hey. That was on the floor.

05:59.565 --> 06:02.139
Well, I didn't put it there.

06:02.141 --> 06:04.992
Hey, that attitude will
be reflected in your tip!

06:07.999 --> 06:11.667
Well, this is gonna be my first
podcast about superheroes.

06:11.669 --> 06:13.901
I'm excited. When do I
get my thick black glasses

06:13.903 --> 06:16.696
with the tape in the middle of 'em?

06:16.698 --> 06:18.562
It's, uh, it's just audio, sir.

06:18.564 --> 06:20.659
The listeners, they can't see you.

06:20.661 --> 06:23.587
Their loss.

06:23.589 --> 06:25.622
He's kidding, Kyle. He's
just trying to annoy me.

06:25.624 --> 06:27.859
No, no. If I was trying to annoy you,

06:27.861 --> 06:29.351
we wouldn't be talking superheroes,

06:29.353 --> 06:31.103
we'd be talking Ronald Reagan.

06:32.548 --> 06:34.996
I love it, Mike. Whatever
you got, I can take it.

06:34.998 --> 06:37.217
Well, let's just pretend that's true.

06:37.219 --> 06:39.386
If I knew this was gonna be stressful,

06:39.388 --> 06:41.847
I wouldn't be drinking bubbly water.

06:41.849 --> 06:44.200
And we're on in three, two...

06:44.202 --> 06:46.035
Hello...

06:46.037 --> 06:49.002
and welcome to another episode
of Ry-Ry and Ky-Ky,

06:49.004 --> 06:50.897
- the Sci-Fi Guy-Guys.
- Yeah, we have

06:50.899 --> 06:52.756
a very special guest with us today,

06:52.758 --> 06:54.057
none other than Outdoor Man himself,

06:54.059 --> 06:55.619
Mr. Mike Baxter.

06:55.621 --> 06:57.886
- Well, thank you, guys, for having me on.
- Yep.

06:57.888 --> 07:01.217
So now Mi-Mi is a Guy-Guy.

07:01.219 --> 07:05.370
You really got to
stop-stop before I die-die.

07:05.372 --> 07:08.763
Okay, today's topic is the
evolution of superheroes.

07:08.765 --> 07:11.418
Oh, really? When do I
get my broken glasses

07:11.420 --> 07:13.437
with the tape in the middle?

07:15.113 --> 07:17.900
Okay. Well, I can't
take credit for that one.

07:17.902 --> 07:21.052
That joke is a Mike Baxter original.

07:21.054 --> 07:23.147
Since you ruined it, it's yours.

07:23.149 --> 07:25.609
Uh, and back to topic.

07:25.611 --> 07:28.782
Today we see our superheroes
with a more nuanced lens...

07:28.784 --> 07:31.080
with moral ambiguity,
complex motivations...

07:31.082 --> 07:33.469
but, uh, Mike, I'm sure you preferred

07:33.471 --> 07:35.210
back in the olden days,

07:35.212 --> 07:38.283
when, uh, our superheroes
just stood for truth, justice

07:38.285 --> 07:39.779
and the American way?

07:39.781 --> 07:41.757
Well, you're probably
not gonna like this, Ryan,

07:41.759 --> 07:42.998
but I agree with you.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.055
I'm actually fascinated
by the complexities

07:45.057 --> 07:47.045
of today's antiheroes.

07:47.047 --> 07:48.455
Okay, you don't have to play nice

07:48.457 --> 07:50.113
just because you're our guest here.

07:50.115 --> 07:52.033
I don't play nice. I
just farted in this chair.

07:55.781 --> 07:58.346
There's no such thing
as all good or all bad.

07:58.348 --> 07:59.775
It's complex, guys.

07:59.777 --> 08:01.277
It's like real life now.

08:01.279 --> 08:03.929
Look at real life... it's-it's
a snake pit out there.

08:03.931 --> 08:06.247
Yeah, okay, but we're
talking superheroes here,

08:06.249 --> 08:07.546
not the real world.

08:07.548 --> 08:09.324
Well, yeah, but modern superheroes

08:09.326 --> 08:10.604
reflect our modern world.

08:10.606 --> 08:13.146
I mean, let's face it, these
are scary and confusing times.

08:13.148 --> 08:14.621
Exactly. And the darker

08:14.623 --> 08:16.700
the hero, the darker the villain.

08:16.702 --> 08:18.443
And today's villains, youch.

08:18.445 --> 08:20.320
They'll crush a butterfly,
eat it like that,

08:20.322 --> 08:21.630
kill women, children.

08:21.632 --> 08:23.970
They don't care. It almost makes them...

08:23.972 --> 08:25.709
a bit more interesting.

08:25.711 --> 08:28.702
Ah. And there you have it, the
viewpoint of Mr. Mike Baxter.

08:28.704 --> 08:29.985
Uh, can I say something?

08:29.987 --> 08:31.992
Mr. Baxter, you...

08:31.994 --> 08:33.595
are full of crap.

08:34.712 --> 08:36.193
What?

08:36.196 --> 08:38.220
Yeah, that's right, I said "crap".

08:38.222 --> 08:39.903
And I'm not gonna sit
here and listen to you.

08:39.905 --> 08:42.967
You know why? Because it's crap.

08:42.970 --> 08:44.653
All right, I'm leaving,

08:44.655 --> 08:47.489
because I, for one,
do not like conflict!

08:55.098 --> 08:56.746
Is it a good idea

08:56.748 --> 08:58.525
for us to go out again?
What if this place

08:58.527 --> 09:00.041
is as bad as the place
where Trevor works?

09:00.043 --> 09:02.645
Oh, it is. We're going back to
the place where Trevor works.

09:03.925 --> 09:06.582
Uh, why don't we just eat lunch in Hell?

09:06.584 --> 09:08.940
Because he was horrible,

09:08.942 --> 09:11.052
and we are going to pay him back.

09:11.054 --> 09:13.364
Ladies! We're ready!

09:19.172 --> 09:21.190
What?

09:21.192 --> 09:23.216
What is this?

09:23.218 --> 09:25.223
Oh, you know, just three pregnant women

09:25.225 --> 09:28.207
going to lunch and glowing.

09:28.209 --> 09:30.733
Look at the size of me.

09:30.735 --> 09:32.729
I feel so...

09:32.731 --> 09:34.289
American.

09:37.024 --> 09:40.042
Oh. After lunch, we should
have a belly-bumping contest.

09:40.044 --> 09:42.183
Hyah!

09:42.185 --> 09:43.737
I love it, I really... I love it,

09:43.739 --> 09:45.756
but why exactly are you guys doing this?

09:45.758 --> 09:47.706
Well, because if Trevor nearly lost it

09:47.708 --> 09:48.865
with one pregnant woman,

09:48.867 --> 09:51.154
oh, he'll definitely lose it with three.

09:51.156 --> 09:52.529
Yeah, and if not...

09:52.531 --> 09:53.870
whack!...

09:53.872 --> 09:55.430
he gets the elbow.

10:00.403 --> 10:01.834
- Chuck.
- Hmm?

10:01.836 --> 10:03.042
Look, I'm looking for Kyle.

10:03.044 --> 10:05.400
Uh, hey, you have eyes on him?

10:05.402 --> 10:07.236
You mean look for him on the monitor?

10:09.305 --> 10:12.157
Everybody wants to talk
like they're on CSI.

10:13.898 --> 10:18.239
No, he is not in the retail
store or in his office.

10:18.241 --> 10:19.305
- What's up?
- I don't know,

10:19.307 --> 10:20.565
I think he's trying to avoid me.

10:20.567 --> 10:22.692
When I find him, I'll let you know why.

10:22.694 --> 10:24.586
Hey, Mikey. How's it going?

10:24.588 --> 10:25.921
Have you seen Kyle?

10:25.923 --> 10:29.451
Oh, yes, yes, he's hiding under my desk.

10:29.453 --> 10:30.525
Ed!

10:30.527 --> 10:32.592
We-we both said we would cover for him.

10:32.594 --> 10:36.278
I know, but I'd like my office back.

10:36.280 --> 10:38.303
Why is he hiding from me?

10:38.305 --> 10:40.138
Everybody hides from
you every now and then.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.203
We stopped asking why.

10:42.205 --> 10:44.112
Kyle, get out here.

10:44.114 --> 10:46.896
Uh, Kyle who?

10:46.898 --> 10:48.904
Uh, Anderson?

10:48.906 --> 10:51.090
Aw, nuts.

10:52.474 --> 10:54.307
Can we talk for a minute in my office?

10:54.309 --> 10:56.452
Yeah.

10:56.454 --> 11:00.197
I'm sorry, I just needed some legroom.

11:00.199 --> 11:02.506
So... so what's going on?

11:02.508 --> 11:04.175
Oh, nothing. Why do you ask?

11:05.963 --> 11:08.589
Well, maybe 'cause I'm full of crap?

11:11.302 --> 11:13.302
You heard that?

11:14.213 --> 11:17.214
I was sitting right next to you.

11:17.216 --> 11:18.548
So tell me what's going on.

11:18.550 --> 11:20.834
Something. Something huge.

11:20.836 --> 11:24.295
I mean, really, really
huge, but I can't tell you.

11:24.297 --> 11:25.672
You understand that, right?

11:25.674 --> 11:27.163
Sure, I understand. I
mean, why wouldn't I?

11:27.165 --> 11:28.498
You were hiding under a desk.

11:29.354 --> 11:32.036
Listen, if this is work-related
or something like that,

11:32.038 --> 11:33.638
I'm here. I-I will listen.

11:33.640 --> 11:35.065
No, it-it's okay. Really.

11:35.067 --> 11:37.290
- I-I have Mandy that I can talk to.
- Okay, then.

11:37.292 --> 11:39.352
- I mean, actually, she's the one who told me.
- Okay.

11:39.354 --> 11:42.612
Not with words, but she just
came out of the bathroom smiling

11:42.614 --> 11:44.298
and pointing at the stick.

11:46.060 --> 11:47.791
- Are you...
- Oh, wait, did I say "stick"?

11:47.793 --> 11:50.127
I meant pregnancy test. Oh, damn it!

11:53.996 --> 11:55.184
Mandy's pregnant?

11:55.186 --> 11:56.536
Yeah.

11:56.538 --> 11:58.821
I'm conflicted. I-I want
to tell you to get out,

11:58.823 --> 12:01.105
but I also want to go...

12:01.107 --> 12:03.038
Wow.

12:03.040 --> 12:05.020
- This is great. This is...
- Yeah.

12:05.022 --> 12:06.936
Becoming a father is the best news ever.

12:06.938 --> 12:08.628
- Thanks. Oh, I'm so happy.
- Yes.

12:08.630 --> 12:10.841
So that's why you
snapped on the podcast.

12:10.843 --> 12:13.228
You heard all the stuff about
snake pit and the heroes,

12:13.230 --> 12:15.513
and-and you just want
to protect that kid.

12:15.515 --> 12:17.390
Exactly, yeah. It's like I want

12:17.392 --> 12:19.109
to cover the baby in bubble wrap.

12:19.111 --> 12:21.760
Yeah. Well, I'm fairly
certain that's illegal,

12:21.762 --> 12:22.970
so let's not do that.

12:24.065 --> 12:25.615
I mean, Mandy and I,

12:25.617 --> 12:27.357
- we are terrified.
- Yeah, this is great.

12:27.359 --> 12:29.027
I mean, there's so much
danger everywhere.

12:29.029 --> 12:30.502
Everything in our apartment is sharp.

12:30.504 --> 12:32.421
Well...

12:33.286 --> 12:34.458
You know?

12:34.460 --> 12:36.201
A-And it's like I don't know what to do.

12:36.203 --> 12:37.692
- No, hey, hey.
- Right? It's like the whole world

12:37.694 --> 12:40.079
was built to threaten my kid.

12:40.081 --> 12:42.632
You can handle this. Trust me.

12:42.634 --> 12:45.475
It'll all change when you see that kid.

12:45.477 --> 12:47.667
You'll stand in front of a
speeding train to protect it.

12:47.669 --> 12:49.231
You really will.

12:49.233 --> 12:51.049
- Thanks, Mr. B.
- Yeah.

12:51.051 --> 12:53.194
Hey, and... and it's still super early,

12:53.196 --> 12:54.880
- so that's why we're not telling anyone.
- Great, great.

12:54.882 --> 12:56.682
Okay. I'll tell Vanessa,
"Don't tell anybody".

12:59.132 --> 13:01.706
Uh, no, you-you can't tell Mrs. B.

13:01.708 --> 13:03.489
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yes, I can.

13:03.491 --> 13:05.052
Yeah, it's just...

13:05.054 --> 13:07.273
Come on, it's my wife.
If I don't tell her,

13:07.275 --> 13:08.900
she would literally kill me.

13:08.902 --> 13:12.278
And my wife will literally
kill me if you do.

13:12.280 --> 13:15.782
So it's you or me.

13:15.784 --> 13:18.408
Okay, obviously, you're
more important than me.

13:18.410 --> 13:20.743
- Good.
- But I really need this one.

13:20.745 --> 13:23.402
I can't do this.
Vanessa can read my mind.

13:23.404 --> 13:25.622
I don't have a lead helmet.

13:32.759 --> 13:34.592
Hey, Mike Baxter for Outdoor Man.

13:34.594 --> 13:36.101
Want to take a second to thank you all

13:36.103 --> 13:37.779
for making this vlog so popular.

13:37.781 --> 13:40.357
I may record it in
the state of Colorado,

13:40.359 --> 13:41.748
but the Outdoor Man philosophy

13:41.750 --> 13:45.770
is really a state of mind.

13:45.772 --> 13:48.606
Hard to believe how big
our following has gotten.

13:48.608 --> 13:50.483
I guess, like me, most outdoorsmen

13:50.485 --> 13:52.110
just love hunting for the truth.

13:52.112 --> 13:53.873
Of course, it's an election year,

13:53.875 --> 13:56.000
so it's really not in season.

13:59.044 --> 14:01.327
But over 2,000 years ago,

14:01.329 --> 14:04.153
a guy had only 12 followers,
and he said something simple.

14:04.155 --> 14:05.957
"The truth shall set you free".

14:05.959 --> 14:08.306
Those 12 guys retweeted so many times,

14:08.308 --> 14:10.628
Jesus now has over two billion fans.

14:11.965 --> 14:15.058
Now, that is an influencer.

14:15.060 --> 14:17.760
The only time the truth
doesn't set you free

14:17.762 --> 14:19.406
is when you hold on to it.

14:19.408 --> 14:20.763
This is especially dangerous

14:20.765 --> 14:22.899
if you try to keep a
secret from your wife.

14:22.901 --> 14:24.993
That leaves you with quite a dilemma.

14:24.995 --> 14:27.571
"Dilemma" from "di", meaning "two",

14:27.573 --> 14:32.075
and "lemma" as in "lemma
explain what I meant".

14:32.077 --> 14:36.195
Marriage is just an endless
injection of sodium pentothal.

14:36.197 --> 14:38.507
Lying to your wife is not only immoral,

14:38.509 --> 14:40.491
it's pointless.

14:40.493 --> 14:43.587
Try it, and you'll learn lies
can actually set you free.

14:43.589 --> 14:44.996
Free to pack up your crap

14:44.998 --> 14:48.541
and move into a one-bedroom across town.

14:48.543 --> 14:50.675
Or maybe a nice one-man tent,

14:50.677 --> 14:53.387
on sale all this month at Outdoor Man.

14:54.692 --> 14:57.192
That's the truth. Baxter out.

15:00.030 --> 15:03.365
Oh, that was so much fun.

15:03.367 --> 15:05.558
Did you see the look on Trevor's face?

15:05.560 --> 15:08.337
Oh, yeah, especially when
Jen asked to see a wine list.

15:10.982 --> 15:13.358
Messing with people is fun.

15:13.360 --> 15:16.746
I'm gonna go take a selfie
and send it to my dad.

15:18.190 --> 15:19.954
No! Wait, no! No, you're not!

15:19.956 --> 15:22.479
Don't do that! No! Hey!

15:22.481 --> 15:24.880
Oh, you guys are the best.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.380
Oh, I'm so lucky

15:26.382 --> 15:28.646
to have such an amazing sister

15:28.648 --> 15:30.287
and mom and...

15:30.289 --> 15:32.788
exchange student.

15:32.790 --> 15:35.213
Honey, oh, that is so sweet,

15:35.215 --> 15:38.039
even if it might be the
pregnancy hormones talking.

15:38.041 --> 15:39.481
Why does it have to be the hormones?

15:39.483 --> 15:41.196
Can't it just be something I feel?!

15:41.198 --> 15:42.632
Okay.

15:43.741 --> 15:45.649
I should probably go.

15:45.651 --> 15:47.725
Okay.

15:52.831 --> 15:55.455
You're, uh, you're gonna
take that off, right?

15:55.457 --> 15:57.477
Yes. I just...

15:57.479 --> 15:59.669
I like the way I look.

15:59.671 --> 16:02.546
I mean, I always do,
but this is different.

16:02.548 --> 16:05.427
Enjoy it now, because when
you really are pregnant,

16:05.429 --> 16:08.413
there's a lot less standing
and admiring.

16:08.415 --> 16:10.563
Hey.

16:10.565 --> 16:12.329
- Are you crying?
- No.

16:12.331 --> 16:14.919
No. It's just...

16:14.921 --> 16:17.013
Thanks for buying us all lunch, Mom.

16:17.015 --> 16:18.515
You're so generous and beautiful.

16:18.517 --> 16:21.184
You used to make our lunches.
Do you remember that?

16:21.186 --> 16:23.469
Oh.

16:23.471 --> 16:25.294
You're... Are you mocking Kristin?

16:25.296 --> 16:27.353
No. Why does it have
to be about Kristin?

16:27.355 --> 16:29.623
Can't it just be something I feel?!

16:34.274 --> 16:36.199
Oh, my God.

16:36.201 --> 16:37.701
You're pregnant.

16:37.703 --> 16:40.445
I didn't say that, but yes.

16:40.447 --> 16:42.038
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

16:42.040 --> 16:44.874
Oh, honey! Oh!

16:44.876 --> 16:47.210
You were so worried
this wouldn't happen,

16:47.212 --> 16:49.495
but I told you it would.

16:49.497 --> 16:51.731
Oh! How far along are you?

16:51.733 --> 16:53.164
Um, not this far.

16:55.524 --> 16:58.089
Oh, this is amazing. Oh, I just...

16:58.091 --> 17:01.218
I'm so happy for you and for me, for us.

17:01.220 --> 17:03.347
Your dad is gonna be so excited.

17:03.349 --> 17:05.563
I know. You can't tell him.

17:05.565 --> 17:08.255
Oh, yeah. Good one. Right.

17:08.257 --> 17:09.601
No, no, no, Mom, I'm serious.

17:09.603 --> 17:10.959
We were gonna tell you guys together.

17:10.961 --> 17:13.161
- He's gonna be really hurt if he found out you knew first.
- No.

17:13.163 --> 17:15.435
No, he won't. Oh, no,
wait, you're right.

17:15.438 --> 17:17.973
Yeah, he will. He's a big baby.

17:20.653 --> 17:23.204
Kyle. Kyle, got to relax. Just relax.

17:23.205 --> 17:25.723
If Vanessa goes
searching up in this head,

17:25.724 --> 17:29.160
all she's gonna hear is the
song "Danny Boy" playing.

17:29.162 --> 17:31.662
"Danny Boy". It's a...
It's a... Never mind.

17:31.664 --> 17:33.988
No, and I'm not taking
suggestions for another song.

17:33.990 --> 17:36.864
That's what's playing up there. Goodbye.

17:36.866 --> 17:39.056
♪ Danny boy ♪

17:39.058 --> 17:41.782
♪ The pipes, the pipes ♪

17:41.784 --> 17:44.285

17:51.726 --> 17:53.108
You cooked.

17:53.110 --> 17:55.394
Uh, yeah. Uh, yeah, usually do.

17:59.859 --> 18:01.752
Yeah, usually do.

18:02.792 --> 18:05.074
- We should take this to the table.
- Yeah.

18:05.076 --> 18:07.382
Yeah, that's a good place to eat.

18:09.369 --> 18:12.439
- Uh, how was, uh, how was your day?
- Huh?

18:12.441 --> 18:15.373
- Day?
- Yeah.

18:15.375 --> 18:16.725
Uh...

18:16.727 --> 18:18.268
Normal.

18:20.202 --> 18:21.265
How was your day?

18:21.267 --> 18:22.599
Super normal.

18:22.601 --> 18:25.758
Just, um, you know, normal.

18:25.760 --> 18:28.478
Howdy-hoo!

18:28.480 --> 18:30.272
Did you guys hear the great news?

18:30.274 --> 18:31.769
- I didn't hear anything.
- No, nothing. I don't know anything.

18:31.771 --> 18:33.817
What are you talking about?

18:33.819 --> 18:36.227
Uh, because of your guest appearance,

18:36.229 --> 18:38.812
we got a whole host of new
subscribers to the podcast.

18:38.814 --> 18:40.518
- Oh.
- That's why I brought the bubbly.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.733
- Yeah. That news. Yeah, yeah.
- Good, good. Yeah.

18:42.735 --> 18:43.766
- Good. Great.
- Yeah.

18:43.768 --> 18:44.999
Yeah. Ry-Ry and Ky-Ky

18:45.001 --> 18:47.294
going cray cray in the hey-hey!

18:48.884 --> 18:50.408
Bubbly dooby doo, doo, doo.

18:50.410 --> 18:52.743
That's what it sounds like to me.
I don't know what you just said.

18:52.745 --> 18:54.078
Uh, anyway, I got to skedaddle.

18:54.080 --> 18:55.580
Just want to drop in, say thank you.

18:55.582 --> 18:58.558
- Ta-ta, Mi-Mi.
- Good, good.

19:00.446 --> 19:01.801
Well, we should eat.

19:01.803 --> 19:03.609
- Yes, right here. Good. Yeah.
- Uh, yep.

19:03.611 --> 19:05.628
Oh, yeah.

19:07.778 --> 19:09.945
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

19:28.781 --> 19:30.707
Mmm.

19:30.709 --> 19:32.882
- That thing with Ryan.
- Oh.

19:32.884 --> 19:35.574
- I know.
- Oh.

19:35.576 --> 19:38.484
Seemed like you were...

19:38.486 --> 19:39.883
Yeah.

19:39.885 --> 19:42.236
- Yeah, so did you.
- Hmm.

19:54.922 --> 19:57.422
Actually, my day...

19:57.424 --> 19:59.549
was great.

20:01.999 --> 20:03.748
Mine, too.

20:05.749 --> 20:08.517
- Want some champagne?
- You read my mind.

20:17.674 --> 20:19.013
The other day, when I was hiding

20:19.015 --> 20:20.407
- underneath your desk...
- Mm-hmm.

20:20.409 --> 20:22.500
... I found a nickel,
and just out of habit,

20:22.502 --> 20:24.427
- I put it in my pocket.
- Mm-hmm.

20:24.429 --> 20:27.314
I have just felt sick about it.

20:29.169 --> 20:30.467
Well, thank you, Kyle.

20:30.469 --> 20:32.623
I've been looking for that.

20:32.625 --> 20:35.366
Hey, hey, Kyle? Uh,

20:35.368 --> 20:37.507
why were you hiding
from Mike the other day?

20:37.509 --> 20:39.174
I can't talk about it,

20:39.176 --> 20:42.892
so please don't ask me any questions.

20:42.894 --> 20:45.918
- Okay. Okay.
- Right.

20:45.920 --> 20:48.586
It's just I can't get into it.

20:48.588 --> 20:49.868
Okay.

20:49.870 --> 20:51.702
But don't worry, it's not a bad thing.

20:51.704 --> 20:54.085
All right.

20:54.087 --> 20:56.277
'Cause, actually, it's a good thing.

20:56.279 --> 20:58.352
I mean, really good.

20:58.354 --> 21:02.972
Scary, a little bit, but good.

21:02.974 --> 21:05.071
And not, like, "scary movie" scary.

21:05.073 --> 21:08.400
- Just, like, "big life stuff" way scary, you know?
- Ah.

21:08.402 --> 21:11.184
But that's all I'm gonna say.

21:11.186 --> 21:12.709
For now.

21:12.711 --> 21:14.642
Eventually, you'll know.

21:14.644 --> 21:16.041
It'll be obvious.

21:16.043 --> 21:18.189
So obvious.

21:19.242 --> 21:20.773
But that's all I can say,

21:20.775 --> 21:23.285
so please, if you can respect that.

21:28.159 --> 21:29.857
I bet it's a boy.
