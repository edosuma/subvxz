Admire <i>me?</i>
<i>[ Chuckles ]</i>

40:31.074 --> 40:34.334
For what? I... I lost
my marriage, I lost my house.

40:34.369 --> 40:37.562
I live in your best friend's
guest house.

40:37.629 --> 40:39.557
I-I work in a café.

40:39.625 --> 40:42.184
I admire you
because you picked yourself up

40:42.218 --> 40:44.046
when you could have
just laid on the floor.

40:44.080 --> 40:45.511
[ Crying ]

40:45.545 --> 40:49.202
No, I admire you for the person
that you've always been.

40:49.236 --> 40:53.991
You're optimistic and warm
and loving and strong.

40:54.026 --> 40:55.557
Ma, you're still strong.

40:55.591 --> 40:58.317
Okay, you're an example
to all of us.

40:58.351 --> 41:01.443
Hey. Hey, hey.
She's right.

41:01.478 --> 41:03.139
Okay?

41:03.173 --> 41:05.502
Hmm?

41:05.570 --> 41:08.096
I always wanted
a mother like you.

41:08.130 --> 41:10.058
Oh, Maura.

41:12.022 --> 41:14.484
[ Sighs ]

41:14.552 --> 41:16.977
You're great kids,
you know that?

41:19.041 --> 41:20.238
Oh, ma.

41:20.272 --> 41:22.931
Because of you, ma...
because of you.

41:22.966 --> 41:26.890
I never really liked Theresa.
She doesn't clean her bathrooms.

41:26.924 --> 41:30.350
[ Laughs ]

41:30.385 --> 41:31.812
I love you so much.
All right.

41:31.847 --> 41:33.742
[ Smooches ]
Okay.

41:33.776 --> 41:35.274
Okay, the group hugging...
I can't do it.

41:35.308 --> 41:37.470
[ Grunts ]

41:37.504 --> 41:39.830
Oh, my God.
Is that my gun?
