You were so right
about Jeremy's computer.

He says he hardly uses it, so
why lock it up like Fort Knox?

He's keeping something from me.

more if you're going back.

What's going on?

36:10.585 --> 36:13.671
- Guys, we gotta go.
- Ava's right. Let's..

36:13.671 --> 36:16.966
Wait! Something's wrong.

36:16.966 --> 36:18.968
I don't feel right about
leaving Taylor behind.

36:18.968 --> 36:21.179
He's not gonna
wait for me, Alison.

36:21.179 --> 36:23.014
This is our one chance.

36:23.014 --> 36:25.517
You know what?
You're right.

36:26.434 --> 36:27.977
I'll go now.

36:29.521 --> 36:30.980
[intense music]

36:32.607 --> 36:34.776
(Alison)
Taylor's leaving now. Let's go.

36:36.069 --> 36:38.988
[dramatic music]

36:43.243 --> 36:46.413
[dramatic music]

36:53.336 --> 36:55.588
[pants]

37:00.093 --> 37:01.678
Cait, you okay?

37:02.929 --> 37:05.932
I-I-I, I shoved things
to the side of my brain

37:05.932 --> 37:09.436
where I don't see
or feel anything.

37:09.436 --> 37:10.937
It's how I keep going.

37:10.937 --> 37:14.023
It's the Park-Lewis way.
And it works.

37:14.023 --> 37:15.900
But right now, it feels like
there's a truck

37:15.900 --> 37:17.861
parked on my chest
and I can't breathe.

37:17.861 --> 37:19.320
We're here for you, Caitlin,
alright?

37:19.320 --> 37:20.572
You're not facing him alone.

37:20.572 --> 37:21.906
The best thing for Jeremy now

37:21.906 --> 37:24.033
is for him
to do the right thing

37:24.033 --> 37:25.743
and confess.

37:27.203 --> 37:31.875
[sobs]
It feels like we've all
lost everything.

37:31.875 --> 37:34.502
Ava's money. Dylan's leaving.
I'm leaving.

37:34.502 --> 37:38.047
You're right. It does look like
we've lost everything.

37:38.047 --> 37:39.507
Like we failed.

37:39.507 --> 37:41.217
But until now,
I've never had friends

37:41.217 --> 37:42.635
like you guys.

37:44.763 --> 37:47.765
Friends who feel like family.

37:47.765 --> 37:52.061
Ava's right. We will
get through this. Together.

37:54.522 --> 37:55.982
I love you guys.

37:57.317 --> 38:00.028
[mellow music]

38:00.028 --> 38:02.447
What the hell? Let's go!

38:04.991 --> 38:07.076
[engine cranking]

38:07.076 --> 38:08.995
[engine revving]

38:10.413 --> 38:13.416
[crow cawing]

38:13.416 --> 38:15.502
So where's Jeremy?

38:15.502 --> 38:16.753
You sure that this
is the right spot?

38:16.753 --> 38:18.838
Yeah, I mean,
he should be on his way.

38:21.382 --> 38:23.551
[dramatic music]

38:23.551 --> 38:25.011
He's here.

38:25.011 --> 38:27.055
Okay.
Um, you guys should hang back.

38:27.055 --> 38:29.015
I-I don't want
to get him spooked.

38:31.392 --> 38:33.561
[dramatic music]

38:34.521 --> 38:37.690
[motor revving]

38:49.661 --> 38:51.120
(Dylan)
'Hey, guys. S-someone's coming.'

38:52.121 --> 38:53.706
Who the hell is that?

39:02.382 --> 39:05.134
Taylor? What happened?

39:05.134 --> 39:08.263
My mom hired someone to take me
to a spa for a rest.

39:08.263 --> 39:09.889
When you offer to go willingly,
they're not expecting

39:09.889 --> 39:11.015
you to take off
with their car.

39:11.015 --> 39:12.475
Wait!

39:12.475 --> 39:14.936
Caitlin has a better chance
of getting him to confess

39:14.936 --> 39:17.063
and turn himself in
if it's just her.

39:17.063 --> 39:19.983
[music continues]

39:33.413 --> 39:36.583
- Whose car is that?
- Jeremy..

39:36.583 --> 39:38.042
You're not coming with me.

39:38.042 --> 39:40.169
I think you should
turn yourself in.

39:40.169 --> 39:42.255
I'll do whatever I can
to help you.

39:42.255 --> 39:44.924
Did you not hear
what I told you in the car?

39:44.924 --> 39:47.844
If I tell the police what I did
then my life will be over.

39:47.844 --> 39:50.054
And so will yours,
because you know why I did it.

39:51.598 --> 39:53.975
Caitlin, just come with me.
Okay?

39:53.975 --> 39:56.060
- He's leaving.
- Taylor! Wait!

39:56.060 --> 39:58.187
There's a plane waiting for us
at an airstrip

39:58.187 --> 39:59.731
and you will love London.

39:59.731 --> 40:01.941
No, I was really hoping

40:01.941 --> 40:03.693
you weren't gonna
try to leave.

40:06.571 --> 40:09.991
- You're not going anywhere.
- We all know what you did.

40:11.075 --> 40:13.620
- I trusted you.
- And I trusted you.

40:13.620 --> 40:15.038
To do the right thing.

40:16.539 --> 40:20.084
- Stop!
- Jeremy, please stop.

40:20.084 --> 40:22.086
- 'Taylor!'
- Taylor.

40:22.086 --> 40:23.254
(Mona)
'Don't do it.'

40:23.254 --> 40:26.007
[gunshot]

40:26.007 --> 40:27.216
Jeremy!

40:29.844 --> 40:32.764
Jeremy! Oh.

40:32.764 --> 40:35.600
- I'm calling 9-1-1.
- What did you just do?

40:35.600 --> 40:37.226
He was getting away.
He was leaving.

40:37.226 --> 40:39.562
He was trying to leave
and you saw it.

40:39.562 --> 40:42.273
- Oh, my God!
- He killed my brother.

40:42.273 --> 40:43.524
And he was getting away.

40:43.524 --> 40:45.443
He was getting away with it!

40:45.443 --> 40:48.237
Taylor, calm down.
You're shaking.

40:48.237 --> 40:50.198
Jeremy..

40:50.198 --> 40:51.824
'Jeremy.'

40:51.824 --> 40:53.242
He was running towards you.

40:55.244 --> 40:56.579
And Taylor was afraid
for her life

40:56.579 --> 40:58.915
we all saw it.

40:58.915 --> 41:02.710
You were afraid,
he was charging at you

41:02.710 --> 41:04.295
'with something in his hands.'

41:04.295 --> 41:05.672
Jeremy.

41:05.672 --> 41:08.841
[Caitlin breathing heavily]

41:11.886 --> 41:13.680
[sobbing]
Jeremy!

41:15.390 --> 41:18.226
[Caitlin crying]

41:19.811 --> 41:21.979
He's alive!

41:25.274 --> 41:27.235
He's alive!

41:27.235 --> 41:30.154
[dramatic music]

41:31.406 --> 41:34.200
[sirens wailing]

41:35.493 --> 41:38.663
[theme music]
