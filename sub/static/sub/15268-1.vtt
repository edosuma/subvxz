WEBVTT

00:30.364 --> 00:33.265
And good morning.
I'm Bill Barrett.

00:33.334 --> 00:35.199
- Hello. I'm Tim Fox.
- We are...

00:35.269 --> 00:37.601
- Barrett and Fox.
- New Country 93.3.

00:37.671 --> 00:39.195
Weather is gonna be out of this world.

00:39.273 --> 00:42.970
We're starting to get into that part
of the summertime when it's really warm.

00:43.044 --> 00:45.103
It's gonna heat up big time today

00:45.179 --> 00:47.807
and it's gonna stay this way
for the rest of the week.

00:47.882 --> 00:50.282
If you're gonna be taking the kids up
on the McKenzie today,

00:50.351 --> 00:52.148
it's a great idea,
but always think safety.

00:52.219 --> 00:54.687
Remember, there's a lot of stores
right along the McKenzie.

00:54.755 --> 00:57.280
Stop in, maybe pick up
life vests for the kids.

00:57.358 --> 00:59.758
Yeah, you can borrow them for the day.
Don't forget that.

00:59.827 --> 01:01.590
You can borrow them for the day.

01:01.662 --> 01:04.153
Use them and bring them
back to the shop.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.698
Another thing to remember is...

01:33.527 --> 01:35.154
Fuck.

01:41.502 --> 01:43.470
This is good.

01:45.039 --> 01:47.507
Thanks, Jerry.
I'll see you around.

01:56.517 --> 02:00.647
I ain't here to bust your balls
if that's what you're thinking.

02:00.721 --> 02:02.951
Well, I ain't here to kiss your ass

02:03.023 --> 02:04.991
if that's what you're thinking.

02:06.594 --> 02:10.086
Listen, man.
Look, I'm not the judge.

02:10.163 --> 02:12.928
All right?
I'm just the deputy.

02:14.401 --> 02:17.097
Let's shake hands
and just put this behind us.

02:17.171 --> 02:20.800
Come on.
I'll just give you a lift into town.

02:24.411 --> 02:26.003
Why don't you take off that badge

02:26.080 --> 02:28.514
and see if you still
wanna shake hands then?

02:31.719 --> 02:33.687
Yeah, that's about what I thought.

02:51.005 --> 02:52.939
You stay away from them, Donny.

02:53.007 --> 02:55.407
I mean it.

03:54.301 --> 03:55.928
- Hey, babe.
- Morning.

03:56.003 --> 03:57.698
Come here.

04:02.509 --> 04:04.443
You're up early.

04:04.511 --> 04:08.003
Yeah. I had this melody
stuck in my head.

04:19.994 --> 04:21.928
You think you can get off early today?

04:21.995 --> 04:24.191
Yeah, I'll try.

04:24.265 --> 04:27.291
It depends on whether
Charlie comes by or not.

04:28.669 --> 04:30.603
Don't worry.
We'll get it all done.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.866
When? I mean, we still
gotta finish the living room

04:32.940 --> 04:35.534
and start on the kitchen
and Megan's room.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.372
- Then we gotta clean up the place.
- Hey.

04:37.444 --> 04:41.346
Look, I'll help you
pack up the living room

04:41.415 --> 04:43.849
before I play tonight, okay?

04:43.917 --> 04:46.715
And then we'll finish up
everything tomorrow

04:46.787 --> 04:49.347
before the truck gets here.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.563
Good morning, sleepyhead.

04:57.631 --> 05:01.499
Munchkin, come here.

05:01.568 --> 05:04.628
Get up here.
Uh-oh, come on!

05:04.705 --> 05:07.606
I think I got someone.
I think I got someone.

05:07.675 --> 05:08.767
Leslie?

05:09.977 --> 05:11.569
Leslie?

05:16.083 --> 05:18.176
Oh, nuts.

05:23.157 --> 05:25.853
- Leslie...
- Mom!

05:25.926 --> 05:28.292
What is going on up here?

05:29.963 --> 05:32.989
Is that your father's beard trimmer?

05:33.067 --> 05:35.126
I'm shaving my legs.

05:38.072 --> 05:40.006
Well, I need you to cut
the grass this morning.

05:40.074 --> 05:42.599
- But, Mom...
- Don't "But, Mom."

05:42.676 --> 05:45.406
Leslie Ryan, you live here rent-free.
I don't ask much of you.

05:45.479 --> 05:49.313
Now you can ride your bicycle
and you can shave your legs

05:49.383 --> 05:51.510
after you do the lawn.

05:53.587 --> 05:56.613
Oh, Megpie, Megpie,
gimme your waffle.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.715
No no.

05:58.792 --> 06:01.226
Hey!

06:01.295 --> 06:02.728
- Megan, are you done?
- Yeah.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.696
All right, bring me your plate,
sweetheart.

06:04.765 --> 06:06.528
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.930
All right, I'd better get going.

06:11.004 --> 06:13.199
Megpie, you wanna grab
my work shirt for me?

06:13.273 --> 06:16.242
- Sure.
- All right, sweetheart.

06:16.310 --> 06:19.074
- It's on my bathroom door.
- Okay.

06:28.355 --> 06:29.913
What's wrong?

06:37.664 --> 06:38.664
Here you go.

06:41.201 --> 06:43.101
All right, are you gonna
help me put it on?

06:43.170 --> 06:45.138
- Sure.
- We seem to have trouble with this one.

06:45.205 --> 06:46.729
Your arm goes through the hole.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.934
- That one? I'm gonna try that one.
- Okay.

06:49.009 --> 06:52.035
- No, that's the wrong one, ding-dong.
- Lt is?

06:52.112 --> 06:54.046
- Yeah.
- No, I don't think so.

06:55.983 --> 06:58.884
- I'll call you later.
- Okay.

06:58.952 --> 07:02.115
I'm gonna need some help here.
Love bug?

07:02.189 --> 07:03.781
- See ya.
- All right.

07:03.857 --> 07:05.586
- I love you, ladies.
- Love you. Bye.

07:05.659 --> 07:07.593
- Bye.
- Bye.

07:07.661 --> 07:09.253
What?

07:09.329 --> 07:12.423
- He's funny, isn't he?
- Yeah, he's funny.

07:14.902 --> 07:16.870
Okay, you'd better go brush your teeth

07:16.937 --> 07:18.377
and get ready to go see Daddy, okay?

07:18.439 --> 07:20.407
- Okay.
- All right.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.145
Tommy, this just came in for you

07:28.215 --> 07:30.183
from Child Services.

07:31.819 --> 07:35.380
- You okay?
- Yeah.

07:35.456 --> 07:38.425
- You need some aspirin, sweetie?
- No no, I'm gonna be fine.

07:38.492 --> 07:40.983
I just need some sleep, that's all.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.599
Thanks.

08:00.347 --> 08:02.645
Jesus Christ Almighty.

08:02.716 --> 08:04.650
What the fuck did you eat?

08:04.718 --> 08:07.016
My wife made tacos last night.

08:07.087 --> 08:09.021
You really need to see a fuckin' doctor.

08:09.089 --> 08:11.250
You're late.

08:11.325 --> 08:14.158
What are they gonna do, fire me?
It's my last day.

08:14.228 --> 08:16.355
- I would.
- No, you wouldn't.

08:16.430 --> 08:18.421
Then you'd actually have to work.

08:18.499 --> 08:20.364
Yeah, right.

08:23.003 --> 08:26.837
So what are you gonna do
after I'm gone, huh?

08:26.907 --> 08:29.375
Oh, shit.

08:29.443 --> 08:31.604
You mean Charlie ain't hired
anybody else yet?

08:31.678 --> 08:33.543
Not that I know of.

08:36.950 --> 08:37.950
He been by yet?

09:05.078 --> 09:06.705
Hey, Herb.

09:09.349 --> 09:11.476
Herb...

09:13.153 --> 09:16.020
I'll suck you off for 20 bucks.

09:16.089 --> 09:18.080
I'll pass.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.728
Charlie?

09:34.541 --> 09:37.032
Really?
Wow, that sounds fun.

09:39.947 --> 09:43.610
Okay, let me talk to Mommy again.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.481
I love you too.

09:48.989 --> 09:50.820
Hey.

09:50.891 --> 09:55.260
Sounds like she's liking her new school.

09:55.329 --> 09:56.762
Well, no shit, Theresa.

09:56.830 --> 09:59.230
Why didn't you think about that
before you uprooted them

09:59.299 --> 10:01.358
and moved them halfway
across the state?

10:11.712 --> 10:14.875
- Who the fuck are you?
- Angie! What?

10:14.948 --> 10:16.779
Who the fuck are you?

10:17.985 --> 10:20.783
- You got a problem?
- Who are you?

10:20.854 --> 10:22.845
None of your fuckin' business,
that's who I am.

10:22.923 --> 10:24.356
- Ls that right?
- Yeah.

10:24.424 --> 10:26.153
- You're fucking Angie now?
- Yeah.

10:26.226 --> 10:28.694
- It's called an upgrade.
- Please. Fucking pathetic.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.730
Hey, why don't you brush your teeth?

10:33.934 --> 10:36.198
What'd you fucking say about my teeth?

10:36.269 --> 10:38.863
You'll be picking yours
off the ground, you pussy.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.166
Okay, fine.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.038
Look, I don't wanna
keep talking about this

10:43.110 --> 10:44.839
every time we get on the phone.

10:44.911 --> 10:47.311
What'd you fucking say?
What'd you fucking say?

10:47.381 --> 10:49.315
- I'll see you Friday. Bye.
- Donny, no!

10:49.383 --> 10:51.749
- Wade, get up. Donny's back.
- So?

10:51.818 --> 10:53.752
Wade, get up!
Come on, man. Seriously.

10:53.820 --> 10:57.654
- God damn it, you fucking asshole!
- Get off.

10:57.724 --> 10:59.624
- Get off him.
- Fucking let go!

10:59.693 --> 11:01.126
- Chill the fuck out.
- Asshole!

11:01.194 --> 11:02.794
Keep that piece of shit
away from my son.

11:02.796 --> 11:03.796
Fuck you!

11:03.830 --> 11:05.695
Okay okay.
That's enough, for fuck's sake.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.097
Rodney, take her back inside.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.600
I am filing a restraining order.

11:08.669 --> 11:10.068
You're not seeing your son again.

11:10.137 --> 11:11.657
Go ahead, call Tommy,
you fucking cunt.

11:11.705 --> 11:15.402
- I fuckin' hate you!
- Bitch.

11:15.475 --> 11:17.636
- Angie, go inside.
- Angie, come on, baby.

11:17.711 --> 11:20.544
- Let's get in the house.
- Fuck.

11:24.785 --> 11:27.481
How are you guys, man?

11:27.554 --> 11:29.522
You fucking kidding me?

11:32.592 --> 11:36.323
Donny, you can't fight
every guy she starts fucking.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.921
Okay?

11:38.999 --> 11:40.466
You gotta move on.

11:46.173 --> 11:48.198
See you guys.

11:50.777 --> 11:52.711
You see Angie wasn't wearing a bra?

11:52.779 --> 11:55.077
It looked like a basket of loose fruit.

11:56.650 --> 11:58.140
Daddy!

11:58.218 --> 12:00.152
Hey. Get over here.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.154
How's my little beauty queen?

12:02.222 --> 12:03.917
Fine. Look.

12:03.990 --> 12:07.118
Wow, she is almost as pretty as you.

12:09.696 --> 12:12.460
- You want some coffee or anything?
- Oh, no.

12:12.532 --> 12:14.762
I got a little time
if you wanna just sorta...

12:14.835 --> 12:18.100
I gotta get going.
I have so much to do today.

12:18.171 --> 12:20.264
- Right.
- Yeah.

12:20.340 --> 12:23.275
Hey, pretty girl.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.277
Why don't you come with me?

12:25.345 --> 12:28.075
I think we have some pudding pops
in the break room.

12:28.148 --> 12:29.148
What?

12:29.182 --> 12:30.843
Wait a minute.
She didn't tell me this.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.350
- Okay.
- Yeah?

12:32.419 --> 12:34.546
- Bye, Mom.
- All right, bye. Love you.

12:34.621 --> 12:35.883
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

12:35.956 --> 12:38.254
- Okay.
- I'll see you later.

12:39.693 --> 12:41.160
Save me one.

12:45.165 --> 12:47.895
Are you sure you don't wanna stay
just for a little while?

12:47.968 --> 12:50.869
Who knows how long it's gonna be
before I see you again?

12:50.937 --> 12:53.906
Tommy, I just... I can't.

12:53.974 --> 12:56.442
- I just...
- I know... I know that you...

12:59.479 --> 13:01.640
So... oh.

13:01.715 --> 13:05.116
- Here's her bag.
- Oh, yeah yeah.

13:05.185 --> 13:08.951
- Looks like a kitty there.
- She drew that for you.

13:09.022 --> 13:11.013
Who's this?
Is this me and you back here?

13:13.093 --> 13:15.994
So I'll see you tomorrow?

13:16.062 --> 13:17.927
Yeah yeah, tomorrow's fine.

13:17.998 --> 13:19.989
Yeah, guess it's gotta be tomorrow.

13:20.066 --> 13:23.229
Okay. All right, bye.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.606
It's been like this all morning?

13:35.682 --> 13:37.980
Been in spurts.

13:52.232 --> 13:54.223
Stupid thing!

13:54.301 --> 13:56.531
Come on!

14:14.087 --> 14:16.021
Well, it's another beautiful day

14:16.089 --> 14:18.080
to cash in our sunshine chips.

14:18.158 --> 14:20.058
50-minute music hour coming up next

14:20.126 --> 14:22.026
on New Country 93
with Barrett and Fox.

14:22.095 --> 14:25.553
KKNU Springfield, Eugene

14:25.632 --> 14:28.567
New Country 93.

14:31.671 --> 14:35.505
- What the fuck?
- Buy another can, ya baby.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.738
I woke up to a perfect day

14:42.816 --> 14:45.148
Told myself there ain't no way

14:45.218 --> 14:48.881
That I was to guess the word

14:50.690 --> 14:53.557
I came up with bye-bye...

15:00.500 --> 15:02.798
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:02.869 --> 15:03.869
Hi, Travis.

15:05.872 --> 15:07.499
Can I talk to you outside for a minute?

15:07.574 --> 15:09.235
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.709
- T, can you cover?
- Yeah yeah yeah.

15:29.162 --> 15:31.687
What's up?

15:31.765 --> 15:33.733
What's wrong?

15:34.768 --> 15:37.931
Sam, talk to me.

15:42.642 --> 15:44.701
I don't know if I can do this.

15:46.079 --> 15:48.547
Do what?

15:48.615 --> 15:50.708
The move.

15:50.784 --> 15:52.376
What?

15:54.754 --> 15:57.621
Sam...

15:57.691 --> 16:00.956
don't do this, not now.

16:01.027 --> 16:03.791
I mean, we're leaving in two days.
Everything's planned.

16:03.863 --> 16:05.831
I'm playing my last show
tonight and we're...

16:05.899 --> 16:08.868
We're getting the truck tomorrow.

16:08.935 --> 16:13.372
Come on, babe, what do you...
What do you always say?

16:14.841 --> 16:17.002
- Your future is our future.
- Exactly.

16:17.077 --> 16:19.773
I know.

16:19.846 --> 16:23.179
I'm just... I'm really worried
about Megan and I...

16:23.249 --> 16:24.807
Yeah, I know.

16:26.586 --> 16:28.850
She's gonna be fine.

16:28.922 --> 16:30.890
She'll have us.

16:32.225 --> 16:34.591
It's all gonna work out.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.629
I promise.

16:41.201 --> 16:43.169
But Megan needs her father.

16:54.014 --> 16:56.676
That's bullshit and you know it.

16:56.750 --> 16:58.581
I've done more for that girl
in the past two years

16:58.651 --> 16:59.743
than Tommy ever has.

16:59.819 --> 17:01.377
Rhett, come on.

17:01.454 --> 17:03.854
- Hold on!
- I need my fucking gas pumped.

17:03.923 --> 17:06.517
- Travis, can't you help me out here?
- With what?

17:06.593 --> 17:09.027
I need some help over here,
for Christ's sake.

17:11.263 --> 17:12.959
So what, you're just gonna go?

17:13.032 --> 17:14.796
I'm sorry.
Maybe we shouldn't talk about this...

17:14.867 --> 17:16.926
I can't fucking believe
you're doing this today.

17:17.002 --> 17:19.800
- We'll talk about it when you get off.
- Yeah, whatever.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.339
What do you want?

17:28.815 --> 17:31.784
- Assholes!
- Hey, fuck you!

17:42.429 --> 17:45.125
- You want some advice?
- No.

17:45.198 --> 17:47.428
Happy is happy and shit is shit.

17:47.500 --> 17:50.128
You need to figure out which is which.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.697
What the fuck?

17:57.310 --> 18:00.609
Good grief, you're...
You're just like my wife.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.615
- Oh, shut up.
- Yeah, she sits on the goddamn couch.

18:03.683 --> 18:05.514
She'll eat a gallon of ice cream

18:05.585 --> 18:08.110
and then she cries to me
about getting fat.

18:08.188 --> 18:11.749
You see, I tell her it's a simple
mathematical equation.

18:11.825 --> 18:14.851
Less calories consumed,
more calories burned...

18:14.928 --> 18:16.623
That equals weight loss.

18:16.696 --> 18:18.288
But does she want a solution?

18:18.364 --> 18:21.060
No no no.
Not to that problem.

18:21.134 --> 18:22.726
She'd rather me just sit there

18:22.802 --> 18:25.202
and listen to her bitch and moan.

18:25.271 --> 18:27.296
What... what are you doing?

18:27.373 --> 18:30.501
All right, honey, this is the part
where you start to cry.

18:30.577 --> 18:33.068
Oh, shut your trap.

18:33.146 --> 18:35.080
All right, let me get this straight.

18:35.148 --> 18:36.581
He just marched up to the house

18:36.649 --> 18:38.514
and started punching Rodney
for no good reason?

18:38.585 --> 18:40.416
Yeah, that's exactly what happened.

18:40.487 --> 18:42.421
And you guys didn't
provoke him in any way?

18:42.489 --> 18:44.480
No! He's fucking crazy.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.388
That's it. I am filing
a restraining order.

18:46.459 --> 18:49.690
- I'm sick of this shit.
- Ange, I understand.

18:49.762 --> 18:52.560
Tommy, you'd better do something.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.899
All right, you wanna
press charges too, Rodney?

19:02.976 --> 19:04.409
Hell, yeah, I do.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.638
You guys are just gonna
have to go down to the station

19:06.713 --> 19:08.078
and file a report.

19:08.148 --> 19:09.547
Jesus Christ.

19:09.616 --> 19:11.846
You guys have a nice day.

19:11.918 --> 19:13.749
Yeah, well, thanks for nothing,
Columbo.

19:21.361 --> 19:24.023
- Leslie.
- What?

19:24.097 --> 19:27.294
I just got off the phone
with Joanne from the church.

19:27.367 --> 19:30.131
And she was telling me
that her niece is staying with her

19:30.203 --> 19:34.162
and that she is going to be attending
the junior college this fall.

19:34.240 --> 19:37.300
- That's neat.
- Well, I was thinking that since...

19:37.377 --> 19:39.470
you're gonna be taking
some classes down there too

19:39.546 --> 19:41.776
that maybe the two of you should meet.

19:41.848 --> 19:45.340
- Yeah, sure, whatever.
- Really? Good.

19:45.418 --> 19:49.752
I'm gonna go call her and tell her yes.

19:52.192 --> 19:54.092
Wait, Mom.

19:54.160 --> 19:55.593
Mom, wait. Mom!

19:55.662 --> 19:58.654
Mom, are you sure she's pretty?

20:19.886 --> 20:21.911
- Hey, Rhett.
- Hey, Donny.

20:21.988 --> 20:23.250
Hey.

20:23.323 --> 20:26.224
Your old man ain't here.

20:26.292 --> 20:29.056
- Where is he?
- Hell if I know.

20:29.128 --> 20:30.789
So you're out, huh?

20:30.863 --> 20:32.296
Yeah.

20:32.365 --> 20:36.734
- Well, it went by fast.
- Not for me.

20:36.803 --> 20:38.930
What was it like?

20:39.005 --> 20:41.940
It sucked shit.

20:42.008 --> 20:43.475
You been all right?

21:52.679 --> 21:55.773
Thought you'd be outta here by now.

21:57.216 --> 21:59.878
So did I.

21:59.952 --> 22:02.182
I wish I could do that...

22:02.255 --> 22:04.883
Just leave this shithole town,
never come back.

22:08.861 --> 22:10.795
It's gonna be hard to leave.

22:10.863 --> 22:14.424
Why? Fuck this place.

22:20.139 --> 22:22.505
My whole world's here.

22:23.710 --> 22:26.907
You're lucky, you know?

22:26.979 --> 22:30.506
You got a reason to leave
and a reason to stay.

22:30.583 --> 22:32.551
I ain't got shit.

22:36.789 --> 22:39.690
- Has your number changed?
- Absolutely not.

22:39.759 --> 22:42.421
God, you look good, girl.

22:42.495 --> 22:44.429
All right, I'll call ya.

22:44.497 --> 22:45.964
All right.

22:51.371 --> 22:52.895
That's all they had.

22:58.244 --> 22:59.609
What?

23:04.817 --> 23:06.944
- What up, fellas?
- Nice shorts, ball licker.

23:07.019 --> 23:09.681
They prevent chafing
and whisk away perspiration.

23:09.756 --> 23:12.020
Jesus, Les, did you shave your legs?

23:12.091 --> 23:13.752
Maybe.

23:13.826 --> 23:15.851
What a fag.

23:18.030 --> 23:20.157
Hey, Dwayne, do you think
we can work on my rig today?

23:20.233 --> 23:22.929
Yeah. Yeah, we can do that, Les.

23:23.002 --> 23:26.494
- Les, why don't you go long?
- Yeah?

23:26.572 --> 23:28.506
- Go real long.
- Okay.

23:32.678 --> 23:34.145
You're cruel, man.

23:36.215 --> 23:38.706
All right, Les,
why don't you grab your rig?

23:38.785 --> 23:39.945
- Sorry.
- Go over to the station.

23:40.019 --> 23:41.646
We'll see you there in a bit.

23:44.090 --> 23:46.024
So what's your doll's name?

23:46.092 --> 23:48.720
- Tinker.
- Tinker.

23:48.795 --> 23:51.662
- Tinker the stinker?
- Yeah.

23:51.731 --> 23:53.892
Hold on to Tinker there, sweetheart.

24:09.916 --> 24:11.645
- Hold on here.
- Okay.

24:11.717 --> 24:13.685
I'll take care of these jokers.

24:16.923 --> 24:20.359
Don't be an ass.
I'm not gonna mount you.

24:20.426 --> 24:22.053
- What's up, buddy?
- How you doing, man?

24:22.128 --> 24:23.561
- Good to see you, Tommy.
- You too.

24:23.629 --> 24:27.065
I heard you boys had to referee
a little boxing match this morning.

24:27.133 --> 24:29.067
It wasn't much of a fight though.

24:29.135 --> 24:32.696
- Rodney got his ass kicked.
- Yeah? He's a lover, not a fighter.

24:32.772 --> 24:35.468
I'd better have Paul deputize you two,

24:35.541 --> 24:39.807
seeing as how ugly over here never put
that baseball scholarship to use.

24:39.879 --> 24:42.746
And Lord knows I could use the help.

24:42.815 --> 24:45.409
Looks like you already got some.

24:45.485 --> 24:47.510
Yep.

24:47.587 --> 24:49.054
How's she doing with all this?

24:49.121 --> 24:51.089
A lot better than me, that's for sure.

24:51.157 --> 24:53.022
Yeah.

24:53.092 --> 24:55.492
I know how you feel, man.

24:55.561 --> 24:58.086
I wish I had some advice for you, but...

24:58.164 --> 25:01.759
- 210, 210, copy.
- So I... I'd better get.

25:01.834 --> 25:04.200
Well, see you guys tonight.

25:04.270 --> 25:05.830
- Stay out of trouble.
- You too, Tommy.

25:05.872 --> 25:08.306
- Use a condom.
- Not a chance.

25:10.543 --> 25:12.204
Good to go, sweetheart.

25:20.887 --> 25:22.752
I guess I'll see you around then.

25:22.822 --> 25:24.255
- Yeah.
- All right, yeah.

25:24.323 --> 25:25.950
- Take care of yourself.
- You too, man.

25:28.227 --> 25:30.422
Hey, maybe I'll see you tonight, huh?

25:30.496 --> 25:32.225
Sounds good.

25:51.751 --> 25:53.981
- What's up, penis?
- What's up, dude?

25:55.688 --> 25:58.521
- Travis!
- Oh my God, you asshole.

25:58.591 --> 26:01.389
Would you quit doin' that,
you douchebag?

26:01.460 --> 26:03.018
- Let's play stickball.
- No.

26:03.095 --> 26:06.690
- How's it going?
- Oh, shitty.

26:09.168 --> 26:11.762
Hey there, my little beauty queen.

26:11.837 --> 26:13.566
Get over here, you.

26:13.639 --> 26:16.301
I'm gonna have you stay with Rhonda

26:16.375 --> 26:18.343
for a little bit, okay?

26:18.411 --> 26:20.675
Why can't I go with you?

26:20.746 --> 26:23.772
Honey, this is one of those times

26:23.849 --> 26:25.749
when your daddy can't take you with him.

26:25.818 --> 26:27.911
Now you're gonna
stay here with me, okay?

26:31.490 --> 26:34.391
- Okay.
- Great. All right, baby.

26:34.460 --> 26:36.223
I'll see you in a little bit, all right?

26:36.295 --> 26:37.319
Okay.

26:38.464 --> 26:40.193
You wanna help me
sharpen some pencils?

26:40.266 --> 26:42.598
- Yeah!
- All right.

26:42.668 --> 26:44.260
You're on the clock now.

26:44.337 --> 26:46.362
Get them good and sharp.

26:46.439 --> 26:48.999
- Yah!
- What are you watching?

26:50.242 --> 26:53.769
I can't believe what they get away with

26:53.846 --> 26:55.541
on television these days.

26:55.615 --> 27:00.245
Yeah, well, don't watch it then.

27:00.319 --> 27:02.253
It worries me, John.

27:02.321 --> 27:04.755
I mean, aren't you
the least bit concerned?

27:07.226 --> 27:09.592
Phyllis, what do you want me
to do about it?

27:15.067 --> 27:17.331
Excuse me.

27:25.311 --> 27:28.906
You can't handle this.
You can't handle it.

27:31.851 --> 27:33.648
You're gonna be on
one of these magazines...

27:33.719 --> 27:35.914
Mom!

27:35.988 --> 27:37.853
Relax, Leslie.

27:37.923 --> 27:39.515
I've seen your tally-whacker before.

27:39.592 --> 27:41.753
Don't call me Leslie.
I hate it.

27:41.827 --> 27:43.795
I'm doing the laundry.

27:45.431 --> 27:47.194
I need that too.

27:47.266 --> 27:49.860
I'll bring it down to you.

27:49.935 --> 27:51.402
Mom...

27:53.372 --> 27:56.603
I really don't like
your attitude, Leslie.

27:56.676 --> 27:59.201
The more you hang around
your brother's friends,

27:59.278 --> 28:03.044
the more disrespectful you are
to me and your father.

28:08.888 --> 28:12.051
Hey there.

28:12.124 --> 28:14.285
Is your mommy or daddy home?

28:14.360 --> 28:16.658
Yeah?

28:18.330 --> 28:19.797
Hi.

28:30.309 --> 28:32.436
Get your asses back in this house.

28:34.680 --> 28:36.773
What did I say?

29:32.371 --> 29:34.305
Fuckin' asshole.

29:36.776 --> 29:39.006
Come on, you piece of shit.

30:36.969 --> 30:39.665
Come on, you son of a bitch.
We need the goddamn money now.

30:39.738 --> 30:42.571
- I've tried already.
- He's right over there. Go get it.

30:42.641 --> 30:45.235
It's the same goddamn story with you.

30:52.484 --> 30:54.213
I don't give a shit, Darlene.

30:54.286 --> 30:57.221
Just stop feeding your goddamn dog
my beef jerky.

30:57.289 --> 30:59.314
Okay?

31:12.738 --> 31:14.831
I seen you try to sneak
past me, buddy-boy.

31:14.907 --> 31:17.000
- I wasn't sneaking.
- Did you get my notice?

31:17.076 --> 31:18.100
Yeah, I got it.

31:18.177 --> 31:19.701
It's laying on the ground
right over there.

31:19.778 --> 31:21.541
I'm going to pick up my paycheck.

31:23.716 --> 31:25.616
Looks like you're gonna be hoofing it.

31:41.033 --> 31:42.793
Well, I better have it
in my hot little hands

31:42.835 --> 31:45.895
by this afternoon, buddy-boy,
or the missus is gonna be over.

31:45.971 --> 31:48.906
And you do not want
her fat ass all over you.

31:48.974 --> 31:49.974
You hear me?

31:50.042 --> 31:52.033
Yeah, I fuckin' heard you.
You hear me?

31:52.111 --> 31:54.807
I said I'm gonna go get my paycheck,
then I'll square up with you.

31:54.880 --> 31:56.313
You deaf idiot.

31:56.382 --> 31:58.350
- He's a goddamn lying...
- Shut up!

32:12.197 --> 32:14.631
You touch those kids again,
I will make you curse the day

32:14.700 --> 32:16.668
your mother shit you out.

32:30.616 --> 32:33.813
I don't understand.
Why is this so much to ask?

32:33.886 --> 32:35.945
Because I already mowed
the friggin' lawn.

32:36.021 --> 32:38.819
- No cussing.
- Phyllis, would you move?

32:38.891 --> 32:42.349
And I need to fix the brakes on my Jeep
before my date tonight.

32:42.428 --> 32:44.191
Couldn't I do it tomorrow?

32:44.263 --> 32:46.197
I want you to help your father.

32:46.265 --> 32:48.233
And then the two of you
could chit-chat a little bit.

32:48.300 --> 32:50.393
- You can take the Oldsmobile...
- Phyllis.

32:50.469 --> 32:52.528
No, I don't wanna take
the grocery-getter.

32:52.604 --> 32:54.538
It smells like Grandma.

32:54.606 --> 32:57.803
John, would you talk to your boy?

32:57.876 --> 33:00.902
Oh God.

33:00.980 --> 33:05.007
Look, Les, just...
Just go fix your truck.

33:05.084 --> 33:06.915
Thanks, Dad!

33:11.223 --> 33:14.158
We can clean out
the garage tomorrow.

33:14.226 --> 33:15.853
Now will you move, Phyllis?

33:15.928 --> 33:19.989
John, I want you to have
a serious talk with that boy.

33:20.065 --> 33:23.193
This is a very nice girl
he's going out with tonight.

33:23.268 --> 33:26.499
Well, I'm happy for him.
Now move.

33:26.572 --> 33:29.097
Aren't you at all concerned...

33:29.174 --> 33:31.608
Gotta work itself out, man.
You'll figure it out.

33:31.677 --> 33:33.804
It's fucking bullshit, man.

33:33.879 --> 33:35.972
If it sucks, you'll come back
in six months.

33:36.048 --> 33:38.676
But you gotta at least
fuckin' try it, don't ya?

33:38.751 --> 33:42.346
- I gotta fuckin' call her, dude.
- You're not gonna call her.

33:42.421 --> 33:45.652
Well, what the fuck...
What am I supposed to do, Dwayne?

33:45.724 --> 33:47.684
- She's gonna be at...
- What am I supposed to do?

33:47.726 --> 33:50.889
We're leaving in two days
and she springs this shit on me now?

33:54.333 --> 33:56.767
Maybe I...

33:58.137 --> 34:01.868
Maybe I should just forget about it

34:01.940 --> 34:05.103
and stay here, you know?

34:05.177 --> 34:07.805
Are you fucking crazy?

34:07.880 --> 34:09.813
What are you gonna do, Rhett?

34:09.882 --> 34:11.610
You gonna work at the mill
with me and Wade until...

34:11.683 --> 34:12.911
My dad did it.

34:17.656 --> 34:20.454
Listen, Rhett.

34:20.525 --> 34:24.155
I would give anything
to be in your shoes.

34:24.228 --> 34:27.494
And I wish I was going with you,
but I can't.

34:29.868 --> 34:33.326
'Cause the day I held
my little girl in my arms

34:33.405 --> 34:35.032
was the day I knew
what I was meant to do

34:35.107 --> 34:37.074
for the rest of my life.

34:40.846 --> 34:43.110
I miss my kids, man.

34:45.250 --> 34:48.583
And believe it or not,

34:48.654 --> 34:50.621
I actually miss my wife.

34:54.426 --> 34:56.518
I know you love those girls, Rhett.

34:56.594 --> 34:58.529
I know you wanna take them with you,

34:58.597 --> 35:01.794
but Samantha's gotta do
what she's gotta do for her daughter.

35:03.635 --> 35:06.661
I'm only gonna say this 'cause
I'm your best friend, but...

35:08.841 --> 35:10.809
but you're not Megan's father.

35:13.979 --> 35:17.437
- Got me a hot date tonight, boys.
- Dude.

35:17.516 --> 35:19.450
- Yeah, right.
- I do.

35:19.518 --> 35:21.383
You'll see.

35:23.288 --> 35:25.222
I just don't wanna see you
give up on your dreams

35:25.290 --> 35:28.748
because you're holding on
to the one thing that's letting you go.

35:28.827 --> 35:30.795
Let's fix her up!

35:41.373 --> 35:43.307
What's the problem with it?

35:43.375 --> 35:46.435
- It's the brakes.
- 'Cause you ride them like a girl.

35:49.314 --> 35:52.306
I don't know, man.
It's been...

35:52.384 --> 35:53.817
it's just been real tough.

35:53.886 --> 35:55.581
But, man, I...

35:55.654 --> 35:57.952
I feel like I'd do you right, you know?

35:59.458 --> 36:03.986
I mean, look, Jimmy, I...

36:04.062 --> 36:08.556
I'm really trying to get my life
back on track, you know?

36:08.634 --> 36:10.602
I prom...

36:12.471 --> 36:15.372
You throw everybody's paycheck
on the floor like that?

36:15.440 --> 36:16.964
Do you really think
you deserve this job...

36:17.042 --> 36:18.042
Yeah.

36:18.076 --> 36:19.907
When there's a dozen
other guys out there

36:19.978 --> 36:21.843
who actually show up
for work on time

36:21.914 --> 36:25.281
and not half-drunk or not at all
because they're in jail again?

36:25.350 --> 36:26.942
All right, listen.
I ain't got all day.

36:27.019 --> 36:29.010
Am I getting my fuckin' job back or not?

36:29.087 --> 36:31.385
Not a chance in hell.

36:58.417 --> 37:00.647
Hi. You've reached
Rhett and Samantha.

37:00.719 --> 37:02.448
Please leave a message.

37:03.922 --> 37:07.790
Hey, it's me.
You there?

37:08.961 --> 37:12.021
Sam.

37:12.097 --> 37:15.066
Look, I really...
I need to talk to you.

37:15.133 --> 37:18.068
I'm sorry I overreacted, okay?

37:18.136 --> 37:20.070
Will you please call me back?

37:20.138 --> 37:22.572
I love you.

37:22.641 --> 37:25.235
You know, life ain't always
gonna work out

37:25.310 --> 37:28.939
like one of your happy
horseshit country songs.

37:29.014 --> 37:31.005
Charlie Chicken-Plucker's here.

37:31.083 --> 37:34.484
Hey, what'd I tell you about
working on your own damn car?

37:34.553 --> 37:35.986
Better put them tools up.

37:36.054 --> 37:39.046
And God damn, who made this mess?
Clean this up.

37:39.124 --> 37:40.989
And where's the other
fuckin' squeegee handle?

37:41.059 --> 37:42.356
You got me, Chuck.

37:42.427 --> 37:44.156
Well, it's missing, God damn it.

37:44.229 --> 37:46.390
How are you gonna clean
a customer's window?

37:46.465 --> 37:48.592
You gonna spit on it
and rub it with a newspaper

37:48.667 --> 37:50.635
like a fucking derelict?

37:51.803 --> 37:54.704
I'm going to the bank.

37:54.773 --> 37:57.435
You better find that other goddamn
squeegee handle

37:57.509 --> 37:59.477
before I get back.

38:17.029 --> 38:19.691
What's her name, molester?
We probably know her.

38:19.765 --> 38:22.962
No, you don't.
She just moved here.

38:23.035 --> 38:24.969
Yeah, come on, Leslie.

38:25.037 --> 38:27.403
What's this hot chick's name?

38:27.472 --> 38:29.838
Her name's Julie.

38:29.908 --> 38:32.240
- Julie what?
- Yeah, what's her last name?

38:35.647 --> 38:36.841
It's Portly.

38:38.450 --> 38:39.508
Portly!

38:41.320 --> 38:42.344
Yeah.

38:42.421 --> 38:44.013
You like that?
You like that?

38:44.089 --> 38:46.023
- Huh, Julie?
- No no, molester.

38:46.091 --> 38:48.525
Flip over so I can pound
your Portly puss.

38:48.593 --> 38:51.061
- That Portly pussy's so nice.
- Oh, yes yes.

38:51.129 --> 38:54.621
- You're so magnificent.
- That's enough, Wade.

38:54.700 --> 38:56.429
- Yeah, you flamer.
- What was that?

39:13.852 --> 39:17.117
- Get out.
- It's too fuckin' far to walk.

39:17.189 --> 39:19.749
I don't give a fuck.

39:19.825 --> 39:22.157
Get outta the truck.

39:22.227 --> 39:24.593
Fuck you, you motherfucker.

39:24.663 --> 39:28.326
- I said get out.
- You motherfucker.

39:32.170 --> 39:35.230
Go suck your own fuckin' dick!

39:37.542 --> 39:39.476
You think you got something
worth sucking?

39:39.544 --> 39:41.205
You got what you wanted.

39:41.279 --> 39:44.715
God damn you brushhead
motherfucking dick.

39:44.783 --> 39:46.876
I hate you, motherfucker!

39:50.455 --> 39:52.389
- Can I help you, sir?
- Yeah.

39:52.457 --> 39:55.085
Finally.
I wanna cash this.

39:55.160 --> 39:56.718
Do you have your account number?

39:58.263 --> 39:59.287
No.

39:59.364 --> 40:02.856
- Can I see some ID?
- Yeah, sure.

40:03.902 --> 40:05.995
Let me check.

40:06.071 --> 40:08.665
Hot out there, huh?

40:10.809 --> 40:12.743
I'm sorry, sir, but your account

40:12.811 --> 40:16.747
is overdrawn $47 1.53.

40:16.815 --> 40:17.941
No, that can't be right.

40:18.016 --> 40:20.507
Sir, you need to stay
on that side of the counter.

40:20.585 --> 40:22.883
Would you like to make a deposit?

40:22.954 --> 40:24.854
I don't wanna make a deposit.

40:24.923 --> 40:27.357
Sir, your account is overdrawn.

40:27.426 --> 40:29.724
I can't cash this check.

40:29.795 --> 40:33.060
You can make a deposit and bring
your balance up closer to zero.

40:33.131 --> 40:36.066
I don't wanna make a deposit;
I wanna cash the thing.

40:36.134 --> 40:39.467
Sir, I can't cash this check.

40:39.538 --> 40:41.870
Well, then I wanna talk to your boss.

40:41.940 --> 40:45.398
Sir, I can guarantee you he's going
to tell you the same thing.

40:45.477 --> 40:47.604
- It's bank policy...
- I don't give a shit.

40:47.679 --> 40:49.840
Get your goddamn boss.

40:49.915 --> 40:51.644
Go!

40:51.716 --> 40:54.048
I gotta go.
I'll call you later.

40:54.119 --> 40:57.054
- Bye-bye.
- He wants to cash the check.

40:57.122 --> 41:00.751
- I'll take care of it.
- Fuckin' people.

41:06.198 --> 41:07.756
- Hello, sir.
- Hey.

41:07.833 --> 41:10.825
That's... that's wrong, by the way.

41:10.902 --> 41:14.303
Yeah, sir, unfortunately
your account is overdrawn.

41:14.372 --> 41:15.805
Yeah, I'm fully aware of that.

41:15.874 --> 41:18.069
All I wanna do is cash
this motherfucking check.

41:18.143 --> 41:19.770
How hard can that be?

41:19.845 --> 41:22.939
Sir, do not use that language with me.

41:23.014 --> 41:24.982
Well, kiss my ass.
How's that?

41:27.819 --> 41:31.255
- Would you like to make a deposit, sir?
- No! Fuck off!

41:31.323 --> 41:33.757
Fuckin' place.

41:33.825 --> 41:35.258
Hey, you know something?

41:35.327 --> 41:37.056
I'm about to come
into a shit ton of money.

41:37.128 --> 41:39.756
You fuckin' idiots just lost
your best fuckin' customer.

41:46.338 --> 41:49.774
- Fuck.
- Hey, how does it feel to be out?

41:49.841 --> 41:53.242
- What do you care?
- You don't look no worse for wear.

41:53.311 --> 41:56.872
Yeah, well, you still look
like an old drunk to me.

41:58.250 --> 42:00.411
I wasn't looking to get
into it with you, Donny.

42:00.485 --> 42:02.180
Well, that's good
because you got too old

42:02.254 --> 42:05.052
to kick my ass a long time ago.

42:07.125 --> 42:09.252
Come on, you...

42:15.166 --> 42:17.896
Just let her be.

42:17.969 --> 42:20.733
- But it's killing me.
- I know, but... but trust me.

42:20.805 --> 42:23.069
You're just gonna keep
pushing her farther away, man.

42:23.141 --> 42:24.836
- Go fish.
- Why?

42:24.910 --> 42:29.108
- I just wanna know what she's thinking.
- Don't call her, dude.

42:29.180 --> 42:31.978
- I'm not gonna call her.
- I'm sick of this shit.

42:35.287 --> 42:37.915
All right, 'Lester,
you're ready to roll.

42:42.160 --> 42:45.994
It's never too late
for you to come back to me

42:48.333 --> 42:53.464
It's never too late to be
who you're meant to be

42:53.538 --> 42:56.598
Go ahead and find your life

42:56.675 --> 42:59.508
Just think of me from time to time...

42:59.578 --> 43:01.205
Hi. You've reached
Rhett and Samantha.

43:01.279 --> 43:03.042
Please leave a message.

43:04.649 --> 43:08.085
Hey, Sam.
It's... it's me.

43:08.153 --> 43:11.122
Look, I hate to even ask this,
but do you think

43:11.189 --> 43:13.054
you could come down here
and get Megan?

43:13.124 --> 43:15.456
I'm sorry.
I know it's the same old, same old,

43:15.527 --> 43:19.861
but I... I've got a few things
I need to deal with

43:19.931 --> 43:23.992
and I don't wanna keep
asking Rhonda to watch her.

43:24.069 --> 43:27.561
Look, I promise I'll make it up to you.

43:28.940 --> 43:31.773
Okay, call me.

43:31.843 --> 43:35.677
It's never too late for you
to come back to me...

43:42.554 --> 43:45.887
Hello. Gas-N-Go.

43:45.957 --> 43:50.257
Oh, no, Doris, he's not here right now.

43:50.328 --> 43:53.991
No, I think he went to the bank.

43:54.065 --> 43:55.862
Yeah. Yeah, I'll tell him.

43:57.402 --> 43:58.835
Damn it.

43:58.903 --> 44:02.134
Hey, look, will you tell Charlie
that Doris called?

44:02.207 --> 44:04.334
It's important.

44:04.409 --> 44:06.741
Or just sit there and watch TV.

44:15.253 --> 44:17.847
Oh, hey hey.

44:17.922 --> 44:19.947
Why don't you run out
and get us something to eat?

44:20.025 --> 44:21.993
I'm starving.

44:32.337 --> 44:33.770
Hey hey!

44:33.838 --> 44:35.863
Where's my money, buddy-boy?

44:35.940 --> 44:37.464
Hey, I'm talking to you.

44:37.542 --> 44:40.841
Get ov... don't you go walking away
when I'm talking to you.

44:40.912 --> 44:43.472
Hey... what the fuck?

44:48.520 --> 44:50.784
You're crazy, you asshole!

44:50.855 --> 44:53.255
Get the fuck outta here.

44:59.531 --> 45:02.056
All right, here you go, Rhett.

45:02.133 --> 45:03.157
Thank you, sweetheart.

45:03.234 --> 45:04.997
- See you tonight, ladies.
- Bye.

45:05.070 --> 45:07.095
Hey, Rhett.

45:07.172 --> 45:10.164
Is Wade still single?

45:14.713 --> 45:17.307
- Wade's always single.
- Bye.

45:17.382 --> 45:19.316
- See you guys.
- Later.

45:19.384 --> 45:21.045
It's in your hair.

45:21.119 --> 45:22.746
You stupid fuck.

45:29.661 --> 45:31.595
- All right then.
- Sorry about that.

45:31.663 --> 45:35.929
You know, this is... it's nice.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.400
Yeah well, Donny, I'll tell you,

45:38.470 --> 45:41.769
the best I can do on this rifle is $250.

45:41.840 --> 45:43.808
Come on, Vic.

45:45.944 --> 45:48.208
- That thing's worth...
- Okay okay okay.

45:48.279 --> 45:50.839
$250 for the rifle

45:50.915 --> 45:53.179
and I'll throw in
that piece-of-shit pistol.

45:53.251 --> 45:55.219
Take it or leave it.

45:58.423 --> 46:01.654
Throw in that rod and reel too
and we can do it.

46:01.726 --> 46:04.661
Come on, the thing's
older than you are, Vic.

46:04.729 --> 46:07.289
It's five bucks at the most.
Come on.

46:07.365 --> 46:10.391
To find a new melody

46:11.169 --> 46:16.471
Headstrong too long

46:16.541 --> 46:22.002
I've tried to fight without a reason

46:22.080 --> 46:26.176
I've been wrong,
so here's your song

46:26.251 --> 46:28.583
To let you know

46:28.653 --> 46:33.249
I've been too headstrong.

47:27.478 --> 47:31.312
- The tip was actually chewed?
- Uh-huh.

47:31.382 --> 47:33.111
- A girl after your heart, huh?
- Yep.

47:33.184 --> 47:35.618
She have any hair on her chest?

47:50.668 --> 47:52.659
Thanks, Suzie. Hey.

47:52.737 --> 47:53.863
- Hey, Donny.
- Hi.

47:53.938 --> 47:55.496
- Suzie.
- Hey, Suze.

48:06.384 --> 48:08.477
Come on, you fuckin' son of a bitch.

48:10.922 --> 48:13.516
Come on, you dirty fuckin' whore.

48:13.591 --> 48:16.685
Come on!
Fuckin' piece of shit.

48:17.996 --> 48:19.964
Donny, pop the hood.

48:21.866 --> 48:24.960
- Go on.
- What's wrong with it?

48:25.036 --> 48:27.630
- Check the carburetor.
- No no, it ain't flooded, Wade.

48:27.705 --> 48:29.639
It's the fuckin' battery cables
and shit.

48:29.707 --> 48:33.370
There's a wrench down there
right by the battery.

48:33.444 --> 48:34.877
This thing's a piece of shit.

48:34.946 --> 48:36.743
- Hit it.
- Hit it?

48:36.814 --> 48:39.112
- Yeah, hit it.
- Just tighten the fuckin' lead.

48:39.183 --> 48:40.844
Just a second.

48:40.919 --> 48:42.910
Okay. Okay, try it.

48:44.122 --> 48:46.147
Fuck, that's bullshit.

48:47.492 --> 48:49.357
- It's tight.
- Try it.

49:05.243 --> 49:08.679
Tommy, I... I've heard
all this before and I...

49:08.746 --> 49:12.113
No, I know, I know.

49:12.183 --> 49:15.118
I know I haven't been
the greatest father,

49:15.186 --> 49:16.847
but I'm trying, Sam.

49:16.921 --> 49:21.187
I'm really trying.

49:21.259 --> 49:24.387
And the thought of not having
you guys around is killing me.

49:28.299 --> 49:30.529
She's my world.

49:30.601 --> 49:32.592
And if you take her away from me,

49:32.670 --> 49:35.195
you're leaving me with nothing.

50:36.501 --> 50:38.435
Come on, Les!

50:40.271 --> 50:42.796
What the hell is he wearing?

50:49.280 --> 50:51.578
All right, let's roll out, fellas.

50:59.924 --> 51:01.152
Brakes work.

51:29.854 --> 51:32.186
What... finally!

51:32.256 --> 51:34.588
Where the hell have you been?

51:37.128 --> 51:38.720
It's cold.

51:38.796 --> 51:41.230
What the hell is Doris doing here?

51:41.299 --> 51:42.732
I don't know.

51:42.800 --> 51:45.496
They kicked me out
in the middle of my cartoons.

51:45.570 --> 51:48.437
Hey, we're heading out to Pyramid Rock.
When you getting off?

51:48.506 --> 51:51.703
Rhett, get in here.

51:59.650 --> 52:01.675
Rhett, have a seat.

52:03.654 --> 52:05.087
Hey, Doris.

52:05.156 --> 52:07.056
- Any fries, Travis?
- No.

52:08.659 --> 52:11.093
What's going on?

52:11.162 --> 52:14.825
The bookkeeper has brought it
to Doris's and my attention

52:14.899 --> 52:17.595
that there seems to be
a little bit of a discrepancy

52:17.668 --> 52:20.364
in the daily deposits...

52:20.438 --> 52:24.431
You know, just a little bit here,
a little bit there.

52:24.509 --> 52:26.943
But as of lately, those differences

52:27.011 --> 52:30.538
have totaled into quite a hefty sum.

52:30.615 --> 52:33.948
Someone hasn't been
dipping into the till

52:34.018 --> 52:38.114
to, say, prepare for a big move

52:38.189 --> 52:40.680
to Nashville or something like that?

52:47.532 --> 52:50.729
Doris,

52:50.801 --> 52:53.929
I got no idea where that money
might be going,

52:54.005 --> 52:57.099
but I swear I got nothing to do

52:57.175 --> 52:59.939
with any discrepancies, all right?

53:05.750 --> 53:07.911
You got a lot of nerve.

53:07.985 --> 53:11.648
- Are we going?
- No, we're jerking off.

53:11.722 --> 53:15.249
- Shit.
- What's going on?

53:15.326 --> 53:18.693
Hey, am I gonna get fired?

53:19.864 --> 53:21.456
Travis.

53:25.369 --> 53:26.802
Hey, what's going on?

53:26.871 --> 53:29.669
I gotta get the fuck outta here.

53:29.740 --> 53:31.173
Why don't you come with us, then?

53:31.242 --> 53:32.766
What are they gonna do, fire you?

53:32.843 --> 53:34.071
Come with us.

53:38.849 --> 53:40.783
- Hey, ladies!
- Hi.

53:40.851 --> 53:43.820
- Where are y'all headed?
- Nowhere in particular.

53:43.888 --> 53:45.412
We're heading up to Pyramid Rock.

53:45.489 --> 53:48.117
- You wanna join us?
- We got lots of brewskis.

53:48.192 --> 53:50.285
Dude, who the fuck says brewskis?

53:50.361 --> 53:52.886
I saw it in a movie.

53:52.964 --> 53:56.024
We don't have our bathing suits.

53:56.100 --> 53:58.500
- Perfect.
- You coming, Rhett?

53:58.569 --> 54:01.595
- No, I can't.
- Come on, Rhett, for old time's sake.

54:01.672 --> 54:03.537
No, I got some shit
I gotta take care of.

54:03.608 --> 54:05.701
I'll catch up with you guys later,
all right?

54:05.776 --> 54:07.835
All right then.
You know where to find us.

54:07.912 --> 54:10.346
- Yep.
- Keep it real, bro.

54:15.453 --> 54:17.887
So you guys didn't see or hear anything?

54:20.958 --> 54:24.189
I heard the guys leaving in Les's Jeep.

54:28.399 --> 54:31.698
Do you think maybe
they took him with them?

54:39.410 --> 54:41.344
Rough road, huh?

54:47.485 --> 54:50.181
How's it going over there, chief?

54:50.254 --> 54:52.222
Good.

55:03.334 --> 55:07.236
- I'll get to the bottom of this.
- Okay.

55:13.177 --> 55:17.807
What the hell am I still doing here, T?

55:17.882 --> 55:21.374
I've been wondering that
for some time now.

55:27.091 --> 55:29.491
You gotta be shittin' me.

55:31.462 --> 55:33.430
Rhett, phone.

55:37.335 --> 55:39.599
Hello. Hey...

55:42.273 --> 55:45.242
Well, no... just tell me now.

55:47.378 --> 55:49.642
Fine, I'm coming over then.

55:50.981 --> 55:53.609
- Gentlemen.
- Tommy.

55:53.684 --> 55:55.174
Deputy.

56:00.458 --> 56:02.824
What the fuck did you say to her?

56:02.893 --> 56:05.862
- Where the hell are you going?
- I quit!

56:08.265 --> 56:10.256
You mind taking a ride with me?

56:10.334 --> 56:12.894
Something wrong?

56:12.970 --> 56:15.632
Let's just talk in the truck.
Come on.

56:15.706 --> 56:17.503
All right.

56:25.583 --> 56:28.381
- When'd you get this rig?
- About a month ago.

56:28.452 --> 56:31.114
Paul got a new cruiser.
I got this one.

56:31.188 --> 56:34.157
I ain't rode in a new truck in a while.

56:35.426 --> 56:36.859
You seen Donny today?

56:36.927 --> 56:40.829
I run into him at the bank earlier.

56:40.898 --> 56:43.162
He wasn't too happy to see me.

56:43.234 --> 56:45.794
- He wasn't, huh?
- No.

56:47.571 --> 56:50.301
I think he ran off
with Chance this afternoon.

56:50.374 --> 56:51.966
You know where
he might have gone to?

56:52.042 --> 56:55.773
How the hell would I know that?
I'm not his keeper.

56:55.846 --> 56:58.246
Tsk, he doesn't care what he does
to them, does he?

56:58.315 --> 57:01.045
I don't know what's in his fool head.

57:07.158 --> 57:09.752
I ain't such a bad guy, am I?

57:09.827 --> 57:12.694
After I got hired on and I caught Donny
doing something stupid,

57:12.763 --> 57:15.789
I cut him all the slack I could.

57:15.866 --> 57:19.267
- Why?
- Hell, I don't know.

57:19.336 --> 57:21.827
- I...
- But you know how he is.

57:21.906 --> 57:24.033
He's an asshole.

57:27.545 --> 57:30.912
Tommy, I really don't wanna be
in the middle of all this.

57:32.550 --> 57:36.008
What do you call it if you ain't
already in the middle of it?

57:36.086 --> 57:38.714
Can I go back now?

57:38.789 --> 57:41.349
New Country 93.

57:47.932 --> 57:50.025
What the fuck is that?

57:50.100 --> 57:51.727
What are you doing?

57:56.740 --> 57:59.607
Hail hail, the gang's all here...

57:59.677 --> 58:01.645
- Drink 'em.
- With their ribs full of reefer

58:01.712 --> 58:03.509
- And their bellies full of beer...
- Knock her off.

58:03.581 --> 58:06.982
16 years of living the dream

58:07.051 --> 58:10.851
We're the pride of all our families

58:10.921 --> 58:13.981
Hail hail, the gang's all here

58:14.058 --> 58:17.858
With their eyes wide open
and with minds so clear

58:17.928 --> 58:20.920
We're ready it seems
to see what it means

58:20.998 --> 58:24.525
To be the rulers of our destiny

58:24.602 --> 58:26.331
Well, all right.

58:28.138 --> 58:31.232
Grandpa thinks I should've
married your mama.

58:31.308 --> 58:33.640
Hell, I done tried that once
with this bitch named Connie.

58:33.711 --> 58:34.735
It didn't work.

58:36.413 --> 58:38.381
I don't know.

58:38.449 --> 58:42.010
Sometimes I wish everybody'd just mind
their own goddamn business.

58:42.086 --> 58:44.145
You know what I mean, chief?

58:52.162 --> 58:54.130
I wish I was rich.

58:55.799 --> 58:59.235
I'd buy you lots of shit,
take you on vacations and stuff.

58:59.303 --> 59:01.737
How'd you like that?

59:22.593 --> 59:24.561
Let's get the fuck outta here.

59:26.163 --> 59:27.687
It's hotter than the hubs of hell.

59:29.433 --> 59:32.459
Better reel in that line, boy.

59:32.536 --> 59:34.504
We're heading in.

59:44.949 --> 59:47.577
Rhett, please say something.

59:50.054 --> 59:51.054
Rhett.

59:51.088 --> 59:52.988
What the fuck do you want me to say?

59:53.057 --> 59:55.821
What do you want me to say?

59:55.893 --> 59:58.691
That I understand?

59:58.762 --> 01:00:02.425
That I'm happy you're giving
your ex-fucking-husband a second
chance?

01:00:02.499 --> 01:00:05.059
- Ls that what you want?
- No, I...

01:00:05.135 --> 01:00:07.103
Why did you wait two fuckin' years

01:00:07.171 --> 01:00:10.140
to make this decision now?

01:00:10.207 --> 01:00:11.902
You knew from the very beginning

01:00:11.976 --> 01:00:14.968
what I was gonna do with my life.

01:00:15.045 --> 01:00:16.910
We talked about it.
You said it.

01:00:16.981 --> 01:00:20.382
You said it to me...

01:00:20.451 --> 01:00:22.578
My future was our future.

01:00:22.653 --> 01:00:25.247
- You said that!
- I know. I know what I said, Rhett.

01:00:25.322 --> 01:00:29.520
I... you know, I just...
I need to do this

01:00:29.593 --> 01:00:31.584
so that I don't wonder
for the rest of my life

01:00:31.662 --> 01:00:34.062
if I made the wrong decision.

01:00:38.502 --> 01:00:41.471
You know, I don't ever...

01:00:41.538 --> 01:00:44.598
I don't ever want to look at you
and think that you're the reason

01:00:44.675 --> 01:00:47.109
I took Megan away from her father.

01:00:55.486 --> 01:00:57.420
Well, what if I was willing
to give it all up

01:00:57.488 --> 01:00:59.456
and stay here with you guys?

01:01:03.394 --> 01:01:06.488
I couldn't... I couldn't live with myself

01:01:06.563 --> 01:01:09.657
and I don't... I don't think
you could either.

01:01:12.603 --> 01:01:16.596
Rhett, you are gonna
thank me for this one day.

01:01:18.776 --> 01:01:21.609
Don't flatter yourself.

01:01:21.679 --> 01:01:25.581
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- So am I.

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:39.192
Fuck!

01:01:41.398 --> 01:01:43.366
Fuck!

01:02:49.399 --> 01:02:51.629
210, armed robbery in progress.

01:02:51.702 --> 01:02:54.796
- Copy?
- Fuck!

01:02:56.673 --> 01:02:58.300
Copy...

01:02:59.676 --> 01:03:01.439
Get the fuck back!

01:03:11.555 --> 01:03:13.386
Come on, motherfucker.
Fucking start.

01:03:13.457 --> 01:03:14.685
Fuck.

01:03:24.902 --> 01:03:26.494
God damn it, Donny.

01:03:26.570 --> 01:03:28.094
Have you lost your fucking mind?

01:03:28.172 --> 01:03:29.833
Get out of my way, Tommy.

01:03:29.907 --> 01:03:31.602
Get the fuck outta the way, Tommy.

01:03:31.675 --> 01:03:34.200
- Damn it, Donny, do not do this.
- Move!

01:03:34.278 --> 01:03:37.076
Fuckin' move, you pig. Move.

01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:41.614
I'll fucking shoot you.
Move.

01:03:47.191 --> 01:03:49.250
That's good.

01:03:49.326 --> 01:03:51.385
That's right.

01:03:51.461 --> 01:03:54.191
That's right. That's right.

01:03:54.264 --> 01:03:57.665
Now move the fucking truck.
Move it.

01:03:57.734 --> 01:04:00.601
Are you the man now, huh?

01:04:00.671 --> 01:04:03.037
You're a fucking big man, huh?

01:04:08.345 --> 01:04:10.108
Isn't this the way you want it?

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:11.772
Right here?

01:04:13.650 --> 01:04:17.347
If you can whoop my ass,
you can walk outta here.

01:04:17.421 --> 01:04:20.948
- There ain't nobody else to stop you.
- I'll fuckin' do it.

01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:24.852
Come on.

01:04:24.928 --> 01:04:26.828
Just like when we were kids.
Come on.

01:04:26.897 --> 01:04:28.364
Okay.

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:32.400
Get the fuck outta the way.

01:04:32.469 --> 01:04:34.460
Donny.
Jesus, Donny...

01:04:34.538 --> 01:04:36.267
look... look at your son.

01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:39.002
Fuck you.

01:04:39.076 --> 01:04:41.169
That's fuckin' cheap.

01:04:41.245 --> 01:04:43.941
- Just think about what you're doing.
- Fuck you.

01:04:45.883 --> 01:04:47.646
I don't give a fuck.

01:04:47.718 --> 01:04:51.415
Ready? Yeah?

01:04:51.488 --> 01:04:54.355
Ready? Are you ready?

01:04:59.396 --> 01:05:02.456
- Fuckin' come here, you dumb fuck.
- Fuck you.

01:05:02.532 --> 01:05:04.659
Get the fuck down!
Fuckin' Donny.

01:05:04.735 --> 01:05:06.669
Don't give in to these fuckers.

01:05:06.737 --> 01:05:11.003
- You dumb shit.
- I'll see you later.

01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:15.774
Get up.

01:05:15.846 --> 01:05:17.780
I knew this was gonna happen.

01:05:17.848 --> 01:05:19.281
- Mom.
- That girl...

01:05:19.349 --> 01:05:23.012
- Don't start, Phyllis.
- Stop telling me not to start.

01:05:23.086 --> 01:05:26.146
Rhett, you didn't work
this hard on your career

01:05:26.223 --> 01:05:29.056
to give it all away for a girl.

01:05:29.126 --> 01:05:32.095
- Ask you father about that.
- Will you go back inside?

01:05:32.162 --> 01:05:34.892
You're not helping.

01:05:34.965 --> 01:05:37.195
Man, oh man.

01:05:40.103 --> 01:05:43.095
Don't pay any attention.

01:05:44.541 --> 01:05:46.566
- She means well...
- Yeah.

01:05:46.643 --> 01:05:48.543
- I guess.
- I know.

01:05:50.247 --> 01:05:53.808
Hey, why don't we go
down to The Stockade

01:05:53.884 --> 01:05:57.012
and have a few brewskis
with your pops?

01:05:57.087 --> 01:05:59.021
- I'd love to, Pop, but...
- Come on.

01:05:59.089 --> 01:06:01.717
I gotta go see the guys
before the show.

01:06:01.792 --> 01:06:03.817
Okay.
All right, all right.

01:06:03.894 --> 01:06:06.795
- Yeah?
- Yeah, sure. I understand.

01:06:09.132 --> 01:06:12.499
Look, son...

01:06:12.569 --> 01:06:15.504
you know, if you do go away,

01:06:15.572 --> 01:06:18.302
it's not as if you're
going away forever.

01:06:18.375 --> 01:06:21.139
We'll always be here for you.

01:06:21.211 --> 01:06:23.736
This will always be your home.

01:06:23.814 --> 01:06:26.408
Right?

01:06:26.483 --> 01:06:28.610
Yeah. Okay.

01:06:30.687 --> 01:06:32.746
Look, would you tell your mom

01:06:32.823 --> 01:06:35.087
that I'm going to Bible study?

01:06:35.158 --> 01:06:37.092
- Right?
- Yeah.

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:38.923
Good man.

01:07:21.171 --> 01:07:22.934
There you go.

01:07:23.006 --> 01:07:25.270
You're looking handsome now, mister.

01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:30.976
Hey there, champ.
Let's get you home, huh?

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:12.388
Hey, Rhett.

01:08:19.229 --> 01:08:21.356
Where's your bathroom?

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:22.863
Let's go.

01:08:22.933 --> 01:08:24.399
Excuse me.

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:29.738
Get up.

01:08:56.733 --> 01:08:58.667
Did you and Sam break up?

01:08:58.734 --> 01:09:00.725
Jeez.

01:09:00.804 --> 01:09:03.863
- What?
- Jesus, Les.

01:09:03.939 --> 01:09:07.205
Stop picking on Les, Wade.

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:11.447
So did you?

01:09:16.286 --> 01:09:19.118
You wanna... you wanna
turn the siren on?

01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:21.453
There ya go.

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:46.304
My baby.
Come here, come here.

01:09:48.051 --> 01:09:51.316
My baby.

01:09:51.388 --> 01:09:54.084
Thank you, Tommy.

01:09:54.157 --> 01:09:55.852
Thanks, I'm so glad.

01:09:57.194 --> 01:09:59.526
My baby.

01:10:05.569 --> 01:10:09.505
Why the numbers
on the phone have to be...

01:10:09.573 --> 01:10:12.303
But I don't have...
But I don't have to be...

01:10:14.844 --> 01:10:18.803
Just promise me one thing
when you wake in the morning

01:10:18.882 --> 01:10:22.181
That I missed her
is all that I said.

01:10:32.329 --> 01:10:35.196
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

01:10:39.803 --> 01:10:41.828
Can I ask you something?

01:10:41.905 --> 01:10:43.896
Yeah, shoot.

01:10:43.974 --> 01:10:45.635
Hell, yeah, we will.

01:10:46.676 --> 01:10:50.134
What if this girl doesn't like me?

01:10:51.615 --> 01:10:54.106
Who, the Portly chick?

01:10:54.184 --> 01:10:57.176
Come on, I'm sure she'll like you.

01:10:57.254 --> 01:11:00.155
Yeah, well, that's easy for you to say.

01:11:00.223 --> 01:11:03.454
You don't look like a... ball licker.

01:11:11.401 --> 01:11:15.633
Just be yourself, Les.

01:11:15.705 --> 01:11:17.297
You know?

01:11:20.677 --> 01:11:23.805
I know this is gonna sound gay,

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:26.246
but I'm really gonna miss you.

01:11:29.252 --> 01:11:31.720
I'm gonna miss you too, buddy.

01:11:34.491 --> 01:11:37.085
- We're out of ammo.
- No.

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:39.685
Yo, what time does
that make it, molester?

01:11:39.763 --> 01:11:42.095
- Time for a reload.
- That's right.

01:11:42.165 --> 01:11:44.099
Hey, Les, what time's your date?

01:11:44.167 --> 01:11:46.431
Why? What time is it?

01:11:48.738 --> 01:11:50.672
Oh, crud!

01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:52.503
See you later, guys.

01:11:52.575 --> 01:11:56.568
Hey, what about our beer,
you little butthole?

01:11:56.646 --> 01:11:59.012
I'll get it.

01:11:59.082 --> 01:12:01.016
Hey, D, let me borrow your car.

01:12:01.084 --> 01:12:02.642
Mine's got all my shit in it.

01:12:02.719 --> 01:12:04.744
- You want some money, dude?
- No, I'm good.

01:12:04.821 --> 01:12:06.413
- Thanks.
- Yep.

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.551
Just hold on here, Charlie.

01:12:12.629 --> 01:12:14.654
I don't know what the hell
has gotten into you,

01:12:14.731 --> 01:12:17.495
but my son ain't no thief.

01:12:17.567 --> 01:12:21.731
I'm gonna whip your ass
and his at the same time.

01:12:21.805 --> 01:12:23.739
Come on, Charlie.

01:12:23.807 --> 01:12:25.707
We both know that wouldn't be
much of a fight.

01:12:25.775 --> 01:12:27.402
Come on, Chuck.
Sit down, have a drink...

01:12:27.477 --> 01:12:29.077
Get your fuckin' hands
off me, you big...

01:12:29.079 --> 01:12:30.137
Fuck you.

01:12:30.213 --> 01:12:33.307
- I'll slap the shit out of you.
- Fuck you, Charlie.

01:12:33.383 --> 01:12:35.715
- You want a piece of me?
- Yeah, I want a piece of you.

01:12:35.785 --> 01:12:39.186
- Hey, back the fuck off, Vic.
- You're lucky, Vic.

01:12:39.255 --> 01:12:42.247
You get to spend the night here
instead of the fuckin' hospital.

01:12:42.325 --> 01:12:44.725
Fuck off.

01:12:46.696 --> 01:12:49.688
- Motherfucker.
- Hey.

01:12:52.168 --> 01:12:54.261
You did... you did all right.

01:12:54.337 --> 01:12:57.932
Where are you taking me?
This is bullshit.

01:12:58.007 --> 01:13:00.669
You hear me?
It's bullshit.

01:13:00.744 --> 01:13:02.336
I'm talking to you, you mother...

01:13:04.247 --> 01:13:07.739
What are you doing,
picking a fist fight at your age?

01:13:07.817 --> 01:13:10.285
In front of God and everybody.

01:13:17.794 --> 01:13:20.024
Is this what it takes
to get you to visit?

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:26.268
Let's go in and have a drink.

01:13:26.336 --> 01:13:28.998
Come on, let's go.
Get out now.

01:13:29.072 --> 01:13:31.472
No no no.

01:13:31.541 --> 01:13:33.941
Get your drunk ass out.

01:13:34.010 --> 01:13:36.535
This is the last time
I'm bringing your ass home.

01:13:36.613 --> 01:13:38.877
Come here.
Move your...

01:13:50.393 --> 01:13:53.157
You make me sick.

01:13:53.229 --> 01:13:56.665
You sound just like your mother.

01:13:56.733 --> 01:13:58.701
I'm done.

01:13:58.768 --> 01:14:02.829
I'm done making excuses
for the two of you.

01:14:02.906 --> 01:14:04.737
You know what Donny's done this time?

01:14:04.808 --> 01:14:06.673
Don't give a shit.

01:14:06.743 --> 01:14:08.973
You never have.

01:14:09.045 --> 01:14:13.141
You two guys
are always blaming me

01:14:13.216 --> 01:14:16.413
for everything that
goes wrong in your life.

01:14:16.486 --> 01:14:19.250
Your mother left all of us, remember?

01:14:21.257 --> 01:14:24.818
If she's so goddamn special,

01:14:24.894 --> 01:14:27.795
why didn't she take you with her?

01:14:32.302 --> 01:14:33.826
See?

01:14:33.903 --> 01:14:36.701
It ain't all my fault.

01:14:36.773 --> 01:14:41.039
So fuck him and fuck you too!

01:14:46.249 --> 01:14:48.217
You're a sad man, Dad.

01:15:04.701 --> 01:15:08.660
Run as fast as you are able

01:15:08.738 --> 01:15:12.071
Please forget where you have been

01:15:12.141 --> 01:15:15.269
You don't want me at your table

01:15:15.345 --> 01:15:18.940
So if I knock, don't let me in

01:15:19.015 --> 01:15:23.111
Now if I knock, don't let me in

01:15:23.186 --> 01:15:27.122
- 'Cause I am not what you are after...
- Shit.

01:15:27.190 --> 01:15:30.956
And you don't know where I have been

01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:33.791
You could love me,
but I'm not worth it

01:15:33.863 --> 01:15:37.321
So if I knock, don't let me in

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:40.995
Now if I knock, don't let me in

01:15:41.070 --> 01:15:44.528
Just bury

01:15:44.607 --> 01:15:48.304
That feeling

01:15:48.378 --> 01:15:51.438
As deep

01:15:51.514 --> 01:15:54.483
As you can dig

01:15:56.319 --> 01:15:59.413
And save it

01:15:59.489 --> 01:16:04.791
For someone who knows

01:16:04.861 --> 01:16:09.025
What to do with it.

01:16:43.132 --> 01:16:44.997
Oh, nice.

01:16:45.068 --> 01:16:47.229
Still alive, you cockroach?

01:16:47.303 --> 01:16:50.636
Yeah. I'm a thorn in your side, copper.

01:16:53.242 --> 01:16:54.971
What are you doing home?

01:16:56.813 --> 01:16:59.714
Julie got sick.
Where's Dad?

01:16:59.782 --> 01:17:01.716
He's at his Bible study.
She got sick?

01:17:03.319 --> 01:17:05.048
- I'll get it.
- Mom, I got it.

01:17:05.121 --> 01:17:06.748
- I'll get it.
- Mom...

01:17:06.823 --> 01:17:09.917
Leslie, I'll get it.
Ryan residence.

01:17:09.993 --> 01:17:12.393
Hi, Julie.

01:17:12.462 --> 01:17:15.431
- How are you feeling?
- Tell her I'm not here.

01:17:15.498 --> 01:17:18.990
Yes, Leslie's right here.
You hold on, honey.

01:17:19.068 --> 01:17:20.660
She is fine and dandy

01:17:20.737 --> 01:17:22.898
and she wants to know
where you are.

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:26.567
Hello? Hi.

01:17:26.643 --> 01:17:28.543
Yeah. I was...

01:17:28.611 --> 01:17:30.579
I'm sorry.
I was just about to call you.

01:17:30.647 --> 01:17:33.514
Actually, I'm not feeling so well.

01:17:34.584 --> 01:17:36.950
Can you hold on for a sec?
Thanks.

01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:39.716
- Will you leave me alone?
- I did not raise a liar.

01:17:39.789 --> 01:17:42.417
Now you tell her
you are feeling a lot better,

01:17:42.492 --> 01:17:44.016
that you are on your way over there

01:17:44.093 --> 01:17:46.926
and you are sorry about the hold-up.

01:17:48.665 --> 01:17:50.895
Hey, Julie.

01:17:50.967 --> 01:17:54.528
Yeah, hey. I'm... I'm actually
starting to feel a lot better.

01:17:54.604 --> 01:17:57.437
So if you're still interested,

01:17:57.507 --> 01:17:59.236
I'll be by shortly.

01:17:59.308 --> 01:18:02.903
Okay. See you soon.
Bye.

01:18:02.979 --> 01:18:04.947
Thanks a lot.

01:18:10.153 --> 01:18:14.146
- What's wrong?
- Mom, I don't wanna go.

01:18:14.223 --> 01:18:16.521
Why not?

01:18:16.592 --> 01:18:19.288
We already missed
the dinner reservations you made.

01:18:19.362 --> 01:18:21.796
Well, so then you change them.

01:18:21.864 --> 01:18:23.889
Mom, you're not listening to me.

01:18:23.966 --> 01:18:26.025
I do not want to go out with her.

01:18:28.905 --> 01:18:32.033
Leslie Ryan...

01:18:34.711 --> 01:18:37.373
are you homosexual?

01:18:37.447 --> 01:18:39.608
What? No!

01:18:39.682 --> 01:18:43.641
Well, then why don't you wanna
go out with that girl?

01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:47.121
Leslie, I am worried about you.

01:18:47.190 --> 01:18:50.250
You never go out with any girls

01:18:50.326 --> 01:18:54.228
and you have all those half-naked men
hanging in your bedroom.

01:18:54.297 --> 01:18:55.855
You don't have to hide it from me.

01:18:55.932 --> 01:18:59.959
I'm your mother and I am gonna
love you no matter what.

01:19:00.036 --> 01:19:03.164
Would you leave me the fuck alone?

01:19:03.239 --> 01:19:06.174
I am 23 years old

01:19:06.242 --> 01:19:09.006
and you are still trying to run my life.

01:19:10.847 --> 01:19:13.213
What's wrong with setting you up
on a nice date?

01:19:17.086 --> 01:19:20.852
Look at me, Mom.
Look at me.

01:19:20.923 --> 01:19:23.585
Who's gonna want to go out with me?

01:19:23.659 --> 01:19:25.854
I'm not like Rhett.

01:19:28.164 --> 01:19:32.726
What are you talking about?

01:19:32.802 --> 01:19:35.703
You are a catch.

01:19:35.772 --> 01:19:37.706
You are handsome.

01:19:37.774 --> 01:19:40.368
- You are intelligent.
- Mom!

01:19:40.443 --> 01:19:44.140
Look, girls don't like guys like me,

01:19:44.213 --> 01:19:46.875
especially not pretty ones like Julie.

01:19:46.949 --> 01:19:49.713
Lord forgive me,

01:19:49.786 --> 01:19:52.812
but that is a steaming crock of shit.

01:19:55.625 --> 01:19:59.391
You have a lot to offer that girl.

01:20:01.330 --> 01:20:03.890
Just fix your collar.

01:20:03.966 --> 01:20:06.526
Fix your collar a little bit.

01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:11.130
There you go.
Make it smooth.

01:20:11.207 --> 01:20:13.471
Okay, and just tuck in
your shirt a little bit.

01:20:14.911 --> 01:20:17.675
Look at you.

01:20:17.747 --> 01:20:20.614
You're my handsome boy.

01:20:20.683 --> 01:20:22.674
- Ain't it funny...
- Les.

01:20:22.752 --> 01:20:25.220
How one day it's sunny

01:20:25.288 --> 01:20:27.620
And the next day

01:20:27.690 --> 01:20:30.853
It's pouring rain?

01:20:30.927 --> 01:20:32.519
Ain't it strange?

01:20:32.595 --> 01:20:35.086
You can wake up in LA

01:20:35.164 --> 01:20:38.099
And by nightfall you're dancing

01:20:38.167 --> 01:20:41.068
On the beach down in Spain

01:20:41.137 --> 01:20:45.164
There's so many things

01:20:45.241 --> 01:20:48.335
I don't understand

01:20:48.411 --> 01:20:53.678
Like how does a river
know which way to flow?

01:20:53.749 --> 01:20:57.742
How does the wind know
which way to blow?

01:20:57.820 --> 01:20:58.820
Leslie?

01:20:58.855 --> 01:21:01.881
And how do you know that you know

01:21:01.958 --> 01:21:06.361
When you know you're in love?

01:21:06.429 --> 01:21:10.058
These are for you.
I dropped them on accident.

01:21:10.132 --> 01:21:11.599
Sorry.

01:21:11.667 --> 01:21:14.966
And how does a guy like me

01:21:15.037 --> 01:21:17.232
Get a girl like you?

01:21:32.188 --> 01:21:34.554
I just spoke with a senior agent.

01:21:34.624 --> 01:21:37.024
He said they probably
won't charge you

01:21:37.093 --> 01:21:39.493
with a federal crime since you didn't

01:21:39.562 --> 01:21:41.962
actually get away with the money.

01:21:46.135 --> 01:21:49.730
I guess we'll just see what happens
at your arraignment.

01:21:51.274 --> 01:21:53.242
So...

01:21:55.845 --> 01:21:58.678
Can I get one last request?

01:22:03.219 --> 01:22:05.050
That's nice.
It's pretty. I like that.

01:22:12.295 --> 01:22:14.229
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:22:14.297 --> 01:22:17.289
- Beer, nice. I like beer.
- Thanks, dude.

01:22:17.366 --> 01:22:19.391
- Kick some ass tonight, all right?
- Yep.

01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:29.740
What the hell is this?

01:22:29.812 --> 01:22:32.144
It's a gift; it's not a loan.

01:22:32.214 --> 01:22:35.775
No, I... I can't take this, dude.

01:22:35.851 --> 01:22:38.581
You can take it
and you're gonna take it.

01:22:38.654 --> 01:22:40.485
And you're gonna go to Nashville

01:22:40.556 --> 01:22:43.252
and you're gonna kick some ass

01:22:43.326 --> 01:22:46.693
and you're gonna make us proud, okay?

01:22:46.762 --> 01:22:48.696
Yeah.

01:22:48.764 --> 01:22:50.857
- Good look, bro.
- Thanks, buddy.

01:22:50.933 --> 01:22:52.662
Thank you.

01:22:52.735 --> 01:22:54.327
Yeah.

01:23:09.719 --> 01:23:12.449
- So I guess you're going.
- I guess I am.

01:23:24.700 --> 01:23:27.794
I'm gonna go check on that thing.

01:23:27.870 --> 01:23:29.337
Shit.

01:23:50.026 --> 01:23:53.291
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:23:56.265 --> 01:23:58.426
How's Megpie doing?

01:23:59.969 --> 01:24:02.062
She's okay.

01:24:04.006 --> 01:24:07.066
You know, I had a talk with her and...

01:24:07.143 --> 01:24:10.579
she doesn't really understand
what's going on.

01:24:10.646 --> 01:24:13.410
But, you know, she says we'll just

01:24:13.482 --> 01:24:15.916
come out to Nashville and visit you.

01:24:20.156 --> 01:24:22.522
I'm sorry, Rhett.
I'm...

01:24:24.093 --> 01:24:26.288
I'm really sorry.

01:24:30.032 --> 01:24:32.000
I know.

01:24:33.402 --> 01:24:35.370
I know.

01:24:44.513 --> 01:24:46.811
I just want you to be happy.

01:24:48.284 --> 01:24:52.220
Well, nothing will make us happier
than seeing you make it.

01:24:52.288 --> 01:24:55.314
We will always be your biggest fans.

01:25:16.512 --> 01:25:18.480
Okay.

01:25:54.283 --> 01:25:57.480
Someday I will find

01:25:57.553 --> 01:26:01.546
- My ticket outta here...
- Yeah, Rhett!

01:26:01.624 --> 01:26:07.119
Get up one morning
and just start packin'

01:26:07.196 --> 01:26:10.256
I make up my mind

01:26:10.332 --> 01:26:12.994
I'll lay down my fear

01:26:13.068 --> 01:26:16.504
Stop waitin' for the next bad thing

01:26:16.572 --> 01:26:19.166
To happen

01:26:19.241 --> 01:26:24.804
I'm ready for the rainbow to begin

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:29.146
I just got through a storm of tears

01:26:29.218 --> 01:26:32.483
I thought would never end

01:26:32.555 --> 01:26:36.082
Someday was a dream
that always seemed

01:26:36.158 --> 01:26:38.558
To turn out wrong

01:26:38.627 --> 01:26:43.587
But now it's not so far away

01:26:45.067 --> 01:26:48.036
Putting off tomorrow

01:26:48.103 --> 01:26:51.402
ls 24 hours too long

01:26:51.473 --> 01:26:55.705
I guess my someday came today

01:27:00.749 --> 01:27:03.274
Maybe I'll take a train

01:27:03.352 --> 01:27:06.082
To a place I've never been

01:27:06.155 --> 01:27:08.521
Where I can watch the sun

01:27:08.591 --> 01:27:12.960
Fall into the ocean

01:27:13.028 --> 01:27:16.088
I finally feel alive

01:27:16.165 --> 01:27:19.191
Throw my heart into overdrive

01:27:19.268 --> 01:27:21.862
Get up and get this life

01:27:21.937 --> 01:27:25.668
- ln motion...
- Because it's your last night, brother.

01:27:25.741 --> 01:27:31.509
And I'll do everything I'm meant to do

01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:34.481
'Cause I'm past the pain and sorrow

01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:38.350
That kept it all from coming true

01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:40.354
Someday was a dream

01:27:40.422 --> 01:27:44.825
That always seemed to turn out wrong

01:27:44.893 --> 01:27:50.661
But now it's not so far away

01:27:50.733 --> 01:27:53.759
Putting off tomorrow

01:27:53.836 --> 01:27:57.397
ls 24 hours too long

01:27:57.473 --> 01:28:02.376
I guess my someday came today...

01:28:09.018 --> 01:28:12.681
You just take care of them, Tommy.

01:28:12.755 --> 01:28:15.019
That's all I ask.

01:28:17.293 --> 01:28:18.885
I will.

01:28:18.961 --> 01:28:21.794
Put this town on the map.

01:28:21.864 --> 01:28:23.832
That's all I ask.

01:28:30.306 --> 01:28:32.035
I'll be listening for ya.

01:28:32.107 --> 01:28:35.565
I guess my someday

01:28:35.644 --> 01:28:38.306
Came today...

01:28:41.583 --> 01:28:45.519
Yeah, it came today, yeah.

01:30:56.952 --> 01:31:01.855
Three years of my life spent on us

01:31:04.293 --> 01:31:08.354
Just got blown away today

01:31:08.430 --> 01:31:11.922
Like a cloud of dust

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:16.801
I stayed around
this little ol' town for you

01:31:18.607 --> 01:31:24.011
With its population 1,382

01:31:26.381 --> 01:31:31.045
I put my dreams of leaving out of mind

01:31:34.156 --> 01:31:37.956
You weren't goin' and I couldn't bear

01:31:38.026 --> 01:31:41.086
For you to stay behind

01:31:41.163 --> 01:31:46.032
So if you're really
tellin' me we're through

01:31:48.770 --> 01:31:51.398
There ain't nothin' here

01:31:51.473 --> 01:31:56.206
For me to lose

01:31:56.278 --> 01:32:00.715
So hey, baby, take
a long last look at me

01:32:03.519 --> 01:32:08.252
Me and this old guitar
are bound for Tennessee

01:32:10.325 --> 01:32:15.695
I'm leavin' you
and this old town behind

01:32:17.699 --> 01:32:19.758
Go on and change that number

01:32:19.835 --> 01:32:22.804
On the population sign

01:32:28.710 --> 01:32:33.670
I'll be thinkin' of you
on my way out of town

01:32:37.019 --> 01:32:40.182
And how I would've kept holdin' on

01:32:40.255 --> 01:32:43.850
If you hadn't let me down

01:32:43.926 --> 01:32:48.761
I guess that's just the way
it had to go

01:32:51.433 --> 01:32:54.368
To see what's waitin' for me

01:32:54.436 --> 01:32:59.032
Down that road

01:32:59.107 --> 01:33:03.237
So hey, baby, take
a long last look at me

01:33:06.315 --> 01:33:10.979
Me and this old guitar
are bound for Tennessee

01:33:12.921 --> 01:33:18.359
I'm leavin' you
and this old town behind

01:33:20.362 --> 01:33:22.557
Go on and change that number

01:33:22.631 --> 01:33:25.600
On the population sign

01:33:27.703 --> 01:33:33.039
I'm leavin' you
and this old town behind

01:33:35.110 --> 01:33:37.271
Yeah, you can change that number

01:33:37.346 --> 01:33:40.782
On the population sign.

01:33:55.364 --> 01:33:57.594
New Country 93.3 with Barrett and Fox.

01:33:57.666 --> 01:33:59.600
There's a brand-new song
from Wade Hayes.

01:33:59.668 --> 01:34:02.637
It's called "Population Sign"
and this is something very cool...

01:34:02.704 --> 01:34:04.433
That was Rhett Ryan
who wrote that song.

01:34:04.506 --> 01:34:06.371
Remember that name?
He used to come by the studio.

01:34:06.441 --> 01:34:08.500
Yeah, he used to come in here
with his guitar and sing for us.

01:34:08.577 --> 01:34:10.875
Yeah, we're the guys
that gave him his big break.

01:34:10.946 --> 01:34:12.743
Yeah, Rhett, you owe us.
