The world
will have to deal with us.

00:45.162 --> 00:46.803
<i>Previously on</i> The 4400...

00:46.903 --> 00:49.202
<i>You belong here...
in Promise City,</i>

00:49.302 --> 00:51.261
- with us, Kevin.
- <i>Since when did kidnapping</i>

00:51.361 --> 00:53.788
become part of this
new religion of yours?

00:53.971 --> 00:57.441
A promicin compatibility test
would be death to this movement.

00:57.541 --> 00:59.606
I wish Jordan had buried
that stuff somewhere.

00:59.756 --> 01:01.058
Just do me a favor, okay,

01:01.158 --> 01:02.610
and just hold off for a while.

01:02.710 --> 01:03.433
<i>Curtis, what about the conspiracy?
What about The Marked?</i>

01:03.434 --> 01:05.116
Curtis, what about the conspiracy?
What about The Marked?

01:05.215 --> 01:06.353
I made the whole thing up.

01:07.686 --> 01:09.286
They got to you.
they bought you off.

01:09.386 --> 01:10.547
There's a very good chance

01:10.664 --> 01:12.864
the director of National Intelligence
is marked.

01:13.047 --> 01:14.447
<i>You don't feel
any different, do you?</i>

01:14.541 --> 01:15.984
<i>You mean,
am I one of The Marked?</i>

01:16.084 --> 01:18.048
Some kind of zombie
controlled by a future human?

01:18.131 --> 01:19.433
You're not Tom Baldwin, are you?

01:19.533 --> 01:22.234
Promicin is evil.
People who use it are evil.

01:22.448 --> 01:25.606
Their goal isn't to change the world,
it is to end it. You can stop them.

01:25.706 --> 01:26.803
What do we do now, Diana?

01:26.903 --> 01:29.137
We gotta find a way to get
the real Tom Baldwin back.

01:36.499 --> 01:38.532
With Tom,
sometimes, I think he knows.

01:39.309 --> 01:42.395
Like, I could be working a case and
I catch him staring at me like he's...

01:42.562 --> 01:44.915
studying me, and trying
to figure out if I'm onto him.

01:45.015 --> 01:47.515
I know, and we're supposed
to act like nothing's changed.

01:47.615 --> 01:50.725
I've been seeing the guy. Every time
he puts a hand on me, I have to...

01:50.825 --> 01:52.173
keep myself from shivering.

01:53.089 --> 01:55.099
We can't keep this up forever.
Sooner or later,

01:55.199 --> 01:57.296
he's going to figure out
we know he's marked.

01:58.015 --> 01:59.123
We have to...

01:59.478 --> 02:01.478
find a way
to get rid of that thing inside him.

02:05.405 --> 02:06.505
All that water.

02:08.088 --> 02:09.858
Takes some
getting used to, huh?

02:11.203 --> 02:12.536
They'll just pollute it.

02:13.478 --> 02:15.950
They don't know what to do
with the resources they have.

02:16.950 --> 02:18.450
Isabelle's in Promise City.

02:19.102 --> 02:21.286
As soon as she gets close
to Collier, she'll move.

02:21.386 --> 02:23.119
She knows
not to damage him, right?

02:23.721 --> 02:26.949
Good. There's one other thing
I need you to take care of.

02:27.149 --> 02:28.499
A potential loose end.

02:29.241 --> 02:31.091
Your partner's daughter,
Maia Skouris?

02:31.994 --> 02:34.794
If she has the wrong vision
at the wrong time...

02:34.894 --> 02:36.436
It could complicate things.

02:37.911 --> 02:38.961
I'll handle it.

02:40.154 --> 02:42.278
<i>We don't even know
how they make someone marked.</i>

02:42.378 --> 02:45.070
Never mind how you'd get
one of those things out of somebody.

02:45.242 --> 02:47.551
Without more information,
I don't know what we can do.

02:47.651 --> 02:48.832
There is someone...

02:48.949 --> 02:50.899
who knows more about The Marked
than we do.

02:52.653 --> 02:54.003
Feel like a trip to Canada?

03:15.287 --> 03:16.620
Cut!
Print!

03:17.077 --> 03:18.078
Perfect!

03:18.192 --> 03:21.203
Curtis, I think we need to go again.
There was a camera shadow on...

03:21.303 --> 03:23.383
Don't worry about this,
we'll fix it in post.

03:23.484 --> 03:25.477
I'm gonna be in my trailer
while you light the next shot.

03:25.577 --> 03:27.555
I got to make some tweaks
to this scene.

03:28.747 --> 03:31.064
Phil...
Great job, Phil!

03:38.848 --> 03:39.981
Hello, curtis.

03:41.915 --> 03:43.815
Sit down.
we have some questions for you.

03:44.156 --> 03:45.190
About what?

03:45.290 --> 03:46.936
About what camera lens
you're using...

03:47.036 --> 03:48.331
What do you think, Curtis?

03:48.459 --> 03:50.159
We want to talk
about The Marked.

03:50.304 --> 03:52.587
I already told you guys,
I made all that up.

03:52.704 --> 03:53.912
The Marked aren't real.

03:56.202 --> 03:57.202
I have to work.

03:57.302 --> 03:59.935
If you want to watch me direct,
I can get you some headphones.

04:00.035 --> 04:01.835
You're not going back
to work any time soon.

04:01.935 --> 04:05.427
Now all we need you to do is tell us
how to kill one of those things.

05:04.973 --> 05:07.530
You guys shouldn't even be here.
It's not safe.

05:07.707 --> 05:09.923
I'm pretty sure
people are watching me all the time.

05:10.023 --> 05:11.540
So you do admit
The Marked are real.

05:12.642 --> 05:13.642
This is simple.

05:13.751 --> 05:15.801
Tell us what we want to know
and we'll be gone.

05:18.197 --> 05:20.772
How do you get one of
those things out of somebody?

05:21.922 --> 05:23.522
Look, I'm not even sure you can.

05:24.237 --> 05:25.387
I burned my screenplay,

05:26.621 --> 05:28.829
but there was this one scene
I was writing.

05:29.168 --> 05:30.976
They were marking Matthew Ross.

05:31.351 --> 05:33.751
They had to put some kind of
weird fluid into his spine.

05:34.201 --> 05:36.300
I think that's how
they take people over.

05:36.953 --> 05:38.561
The characters I was writing,

05:39.530 --> 05:41.230
they kept talking about these...

05:41.631 --> 05:43.306
tiny machines inside the fluid.

05:43.771 --> 05:45.105
Tiny machines?

05:46.521 --> 05:49.371
- What does that mean?
- Look, I'm a filmmaker, not a...

05:49.487 --> 05:50.604
scientist.

06:00.424 --> 06:01.424
All by yourself?

06:04.805 --> 06:06.488
I like it here
in the morning.

06:08.738 --> 06:09.867
It is pretty.

06:11.783 --> 06:13.000
What's your name?

06:14.803 --> 06:15.803
Sophia.

06:17.659 --> 06:18.805
What can you do?

06:19.819 --> 06:21.219
What makes you special, Sophia?

06:22.219 --> 06:23.885
You know how we have
five senses?

06:25.267 --> 06:26.433
I can play with them.

06:26.550 --> 06:28.691
I can make whichever ones I want
stronger or weaker.

06:28.791 --> 06:29.866
So if you want to...

06:30.758 --> 06:32.592
you could make someone
blind or deaf?

06:35.803 --> 06:37.853
Sophia, why don't you
come along with me?

06:39.327 --> 06:40.890
Shawn, this is Sophia.

06:41.324 --> 06:42.557
She's so nice.

06:43.235 --> 06:44.735
She's going to help us out.

06:46.872 --> 06:47.989
All right.

06:48.196 --> 06:49.996
I think you've gathered
enough people now.

06:50.096 --> 06:51.594
We know where they're
holding Kevin.

06:51.694 --> 06:53.776
Let's go get him before
everyone wakes up.

07:27.455 --> 07:28.839
Ready to get out of here?

07:30.019 --> 07:31.179
It's good you came.

07:31.736 --> 07:33.902
They wouldn't give me
any sunflower seeds.

07:34.253 --> 07:36.053
I found that agitating.

07:45.313 --> 07:48.230
- Whatcha doing?
- Just walking to the bus stop.

07:48.980 --> 07:51.090
- Where's my mom?
- Yeah, I'm working solo today.

07:51.190 --> 07:53.222
Diana told me she had
an errand she need to run.

07:54.291 --> 07:56.149
I'm heading your way.
Do you want a lift?

07:56.249 --> 07:57.920
- Sure.
- Great.

08:06.295 --> 08:07.470
That was kind of weird, huh?

08:07.594 --> 08:09.944
How we just saw each other
on the street?

08:11.256 --> 08:13.519
To be honest, Maia,
it wasn't a coincidence. I...

08:14.219 --> 08:16.286
I wanted to talk to you
about your mom.

08:17.154 --> 08:18.387
Is something wrong?

08:18.837 --> 08:20.399
It's probably
nothing, but...

08:21.145 --> 08:22.511
She's been acting
funny at work.

08:22.611 --> 08:25.315
I think she's under a lot of stress.
Have you noticed anything?

08:25.422 --> 08:27.383
Not really. I...

08:27.933 --> 08:29.583
I guess she's been
working hard.

08:30.483 --> 08:32.717
She talks to your
new boss all the time.

08:34.405 --> 08:36.371
She even comes over here
at night sometimes.

08:37.741 --> 08:38.741
Really?

08:39.634 --> 08:41.933
Do you think I could have
a little ice with this soda?

08:42.260 --> 08:43.967
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

08:48.303 --> 08:49.442
What about visions, Maia?

08:49.542 --> 08:52.553
Have you seen
anything unusual lately?

08:53.153 --> 08:55.020
- Anything at all?
- No, just...

08:55.236 --> 08:56.836
- Just little stuff.
- Yeah?

08:59.070 --> 09:00.070
Thanks.

09:01.753 --> 09:02.753
Wait, cheers.

09:09.616 --> 09:11.533
Can't remember
the last time I had root beer.

09:11.766 --> 09:12.766
It's good.

09:15.047 --> 09:16.897
Well, I guess
it's probably nothing.

09:18.347 --> 09:20.463
But you know what,
do me a favor, though. Don't...

09:20.604 --> 09:22.471
Don't tell your mom
we had this little talk.

09:22.576 --> 09:24.808
I don't want her to think
that I'm worried about her.

09:24.908 --> 09:25.911
Okay.

09:27.444 --> 09:29.360
- You feeling tired, sweetie?
- A little.

09:29.844 --> 09:32.194
Why don't you take a nap?
I can let myself out.

09:32.327 --> 09:33.327
Okay.

09:35.925 --> 09:36.941
See you.

09:37.091 --> 09:38.091
See you.

10:11.937 --> 10:12.937
It's done.

10:13.737 --> 10:15.937
I gave the girl
a massive dose of the inhibitor.

10:16.037 --> 10:18.612
She won't be having any visions
for a couple of weeks.

10:24.820 --> 10:26.105
I want this to be fast.

10:26.337 --> 10:28.137
We need be
in and out of the center

10:28.454 --> 10:30.604
as quickly as Shawn
got into Promise City.

10:31.105 --> 10:32.105
Ground floor...

10:34.510 --> 10:37.493
In the back, as the foyer opens
onto the rose garden.

10:37.593 --> 10:38.350
Both teams split up
inside the foyer...

10:38.351 --> 10:39.810
<i>Both teams split up
inside the foyer...</i>

10:40.868 --> 10:41.868
What's going on?

10:42.037 --> 10:43.537
Why does he have bodyguards
around him all day?

10:43.637 --> 10:46.228
Shawn came into Promise City
this morning with another 4400.

10:46.328 --> 10:47.468
They took Kevin Burkhoff.

10:49.356 --> 10:50.994
You're not going to hurt him,
are you?

10:51.102 --> 10:53.466
Shawn needs to learn
to stay out of our way.

10:58.066 --> 10:59.499
Things are going to get...

11:00.621 --> 11:01.971
crazy around here for a while.

11:04.255 --> 11:05.688
I gotta get back in there.

11:05.928 --> 11:07.661
I'll come find you later, okay?

11:18.811 --> 11:20.445
Curtis Peck dropped out of
school in tenth grade.

11:20.528 --> 11:22.076
I think it's safe to assume
he doesn't have

11:22.176 --> 11:23.907
much grounding
in the scientific method.

11:24.059 --> 11:26.751
But when he talks about tiny machines
in someone's spinal fluid,

11:26.851 --> 11:28.726
there's really only one thing
Curtis could mean.

11:28.826 --> 11:30.426
- Nanites.
- Nanotechnology.

11:30.593 --> 11:32.998
That's right.
Machines built at the molecular level.

11:33.185 --> 11:34.573
- Tiny machines.
- Wait...

11:34.673 --> 11:37.244
I haven't read the last couple issues
of <i>Scientific American,</i>

11:37.344 --> 11:39.848
but as far as I know,
nanites are a theoretical technology.

11:39.948 --> 11:41.548
- They don't exist.
- Not yet.

11:41.680 --> 11:42.907
Not that we know of, anyway.

11:43.634 --> 11:44.647
When someone's marked,

11:44.834 --> 11:46.781
one personality
takes over another, right?

11:46.930 --> 11:48.180
So, how does that happen?

11:49.064 --> 11:50.064
Nanites.

11:50.385 --> 11:52.714
Somehow,
the personality of the...

11:52.947 --> 11:55.543
future guy is encoded
in these little machines.

11:55.857 --> 11:58.974
They're injected into someone's
cerebrospinal fluid.

11:59.540 --> 12:00.540
They replicate,

12:01.431 --> 12:03.631
and once there's
enough of them... Bam!

12:03.781 --> 12:05.892
- You're marked.
- So how do you destroy nanites?

12:06.642 --> 12:07.859
I have no idea.

12:08.059 --> 12:09.800
Officially,
nobody's even built them yet,

12:09.900 --> 12:12.742
much less worried about how
to get them out of somebody.

12:14.994 --> 12:15.994
Hey, guys.

12:16.308 --> 12:19.396
Garrity said you were all down here.
Figured I'd join the party.

12:20.590 --> 12:22.839
You said you had that
real estate thing.

12:22.939 --> 12:24.781
- I didn't know you were back.
- Yeah, I...

12:25.081 --> 12:26.215
saw the place in <i>Lynwood.</i>

12:26.315 --> 12:28.765
We're just debating
the pros and cons of...

12:29.065 --> 12:30.065
suburbia.

12:30.882 --> 12:32.215
That guy looks stressed.

12:33.038 --> 12:34.357
Guess he's a city dweller.

12:35.807 --> 12:38.244
They were here when we got down here.
Where have you been?

12:38.465 --> 12:39.465
Just case work.

12:39.740 --> 12:42.398
We've been hearing rumors
about a promicin distribution network

12:42.498 --> 12:44.340
out at Northmount college.

12:44.656 --> 12:45.934
I was just poking around.

12:46.902 --> 12:48.402
Well, I'd better get upstairs.

12:48.682 --> 12:52.098
Look, it all comes down to whether
you want to put up with a long commute.

13:02.905 --> 13:05.222
Jordan is nothing
if not persistent.

13:05.333 --> 13:07.283
It won't be long before
he comes back on us.

13:07.465 --> 13:08.698
Maybe we should leave.

13:09.098 --> 13:12.458
- He won't hurt Shawn if we're not here.
- No, you're not going anywhere.

13:12.739 --> 13:15.117
Collier's proved he'll find you
no matter where you are,

13:15.217 --> 13:16.909
so this place
is as good as any.

13:17.035 --> 13:19.193
We have 4400s here
who believe in what we're doing,

13:19.293 --> 13:20.869
even people
who've taken the shot.

13:20.996 --> 13:22.404
They're willing to protect you.

13:22.558 --> 13:25.141
So, whatever Collier's planning,
we'll be ready for him.

13:25.804 --> 13:27.804
- Shawn, I'm sorry to interrupt.
- It's okay.

13:27.904 --> 13:30.211
Your brother and your mother
are waiting downstairs.

13:30.894 --> 13:32.694
Okay... I'll be right back.

13:37.581 --> 13:39.049
Hey, mom.
Hey, Danny.

13:40.327 --> 13:41.856
I know we don't have
an appointment,

13:41.956 --> 13:44.033
but I was out for coffee
with your brother,

13:44.133 --> 13:45.476
and I figured we'd stop by.

13:45.842 --> 13:47.192
Well, good, I'm glad.

13:47.576 --> 13:49.982
It's good to see you guys.
It's just... right now...

13:50.114 --> 13:51.281
It's not a good time?

13:51.747 --> 13:52.747
See, I told you.

13:53.343 --> 13:56.523
I know I always say that, it's just
right now is a really bad time.

13:56.623 --> 13:57.990
Okay, I get it.

13:59.235 --> 14:00.532
I just wanted to look at you.

14:00.632 --> 14:02.022
I will come by this weekend.

14:02.122 --> 14:03.880
- We'll have dinner.
- Good.

14:04.014 --> 14:05.914
I'll have my people
call your people.

14:06.098 --> 14:09.153
Oh, okay. All right.
I'll be waiting for that call.

14:10.053 --> 14:11.953
I'll be there in a minute,
okay, mom?

14:12.582 --> 14:14.587
Joanna, could you just
give us a second?

14:14.687 --> 14:16.450
- Sure.
- Thanks. Bye, mom.

14:20.132 --> 14:22.032
So, I saw you on the news.

14:23.882 --> 14:27.579
You were talking about this
promicin compatibility test?

14:28.371 --> 14:29.555
Yeah, we're working on it.

14:29.655 --> 14:30.671
I want to take it.

14:33.671 --> 14:36.268
Shawn, I've had that shot
sitting around for months now.

14:36.368 --> 14:39.512
I figured I'd never take it,
but this test changes everything.

14:39.987 --> 14:41.954
I could find out
whether it's safe or not.

14:42.081 --> 14:44.581
It's just the test
isn't really ready yet, Danny.

14:44.839 --> 14:46.239
Yeah, but it's close, right?

14:46.574 --> 14:49.074
I'm just looking for a rough idea
of what my odds might be.

14:55.377 --> 14:58.994
Well, no school for you tomorrow.
You have a temperature of 101.

14:59.994 --> 15:01.772
When did you start
feeling bad?

15:01.955 --> 15:03.055
This afternoon.

15:03.226 --> 15:04.509
Oh, honey.

15:05.658 --> 15:06.791
Well, at school?

15:07.478 --> 15:08.478
No.

15:09.952 --> 15:10.952
On the bus ride home.

15:13.576 --> 15:15.176
Well, here, you take these...

15:16.293 --> 15:18.743
And we'll take your temperature again
in the morning.

15:23.063 --> 15:24.063
Who's that?

15:26.760 --> 15:28.474
Hey, sorry
to drop by unannounced,

15:28.579 --> 15:31.739
but I just had a two-hour phone call
with a guy in my graduate school class.

15:31.839 --> 15:33.229
He works at J.P.L. now.

15:33.346 --> 15:36.514
I asked him how you'd get an infection
of nanites out of someone's body.

15:37.180 --> 15:40.005
- First, he laughed at me.
- What happened when he got serious?

15:40.105 --> 15:42.048
He said, theoretically,
it's possible.

15:42.424 --> 15:45.468
Nanites, if they existed,
would have a molecular structure,

15:45.584 --> 15:47.668
which means their chemical bonds
could be broken.

15:47.771 --> 15:48.771
Okay, how?

15:48.916 --> 15:50.474
Here's where it gets
a little dicey.

15:50.574 --> 15:52.524
My friend said
the only way you could be sure

15:52.624 --> 15:54.142
all the nanites were destroyed...

15:54.477 --> 15:57.287
would be to expose someone
to a highly radioactive substance.

15:57.404 --> 15:58.496
Something like polonium.

16:00.694 --> 16:01.794
How much radiation?

16:02.836 --> 16:04.895
About 50 nanograms
would do the job.

16:05.830 --> 16:08.020
- Tom would die.
- I know.

16:08.408 --> 16:10.641
If we really want to kill
that thing inside him,

16:10.770 --> 16:12.512
we're gonna have to kill Tom, too.

16:16.121 --> 16:18.227
So Diana Skouris
was definitely a passenger

16:18.327 --> 16:20.201
on your flight to Vancouver
yesterday?

16:21.136 --> 16:24.320
Can you check to see if there was
a Meghan Doyle on that same flight?

16:25.203 --> 16:26.203
She was.

16:26.486 --> 16:27.486
Thanks.

16:28.100 --> 16:29.300
Hey, good morning.

16:29.850 --> 16:31.921
- Morning.
- Anything going on?

16:33.630 --> 16:34.630
Yeah, actually.

16:37.130 --> 16:39.080
We had a tip
on that college promicin case.

16:39.180 --> 16:41.094
A student named
Penelope Rice called.

16:43.108 --> 16:45.258
She said
her peace studies professor

16:45.358 --> 16:47.408
has been lecturing
in favor taking the shot.

16:47.759 --> 16:50.026
Well, you think he's been
supplying the students?

16:50.821 --> 16:52.471
I think it's worth
taking a look.

16:52.591 --> 16:53.591
You drive.

16:55.091 --> 16:56.091
Coming?

16:59.973 --> 17:01.807
You had this cat scan
yesterday?

17:03.257 --> 17:06.491
I had to drop Shawn's name
to get an appointment, but they took me.

17:06.622 --> 17:08.214
You have a beautiful brain,

17:08.980 --> 17:12.627
but I'm afraid you won't be able
to help me with the compatibility test.

17:13.202 --> 17:14.441
I don't understand.
Why not?

17:14.540 --> 17:17.008
Doesn't matter. He just told you
you can't take the shot.

17:18.316 --> 17:19.965
No, that's not what I said.

17:20.761 --> 17:22.928
At this point,
the test is almost ready.

17:23.646 --> 17:26.529
I'm just narrowing down
who would live and who wouldn't.

17:26.846 --> 17:29.645
I can already answer that
for 90% of the population.

17:29.745 --> 17:33.040
It's the middle 10%
that I'm focused on.

17:33.303 --> 17:35.963
I have to find
that exact dividing line

17:36.091 --> 17:38.308
between death and survival.

17:39.091 --> 17:40.091
You...

17:40.856 --> 17:42.456
You're a statistical outlier.

17:43.227 --> 17:44.227
Look for yourself.

17:45.537 --> 17:49.687
You have a very prominent
corpus collosum.

17:49.837 --> 17:51.787
One of the largest
I've ever seen.

17:52.854 --> 17:55.221
So my chances
of survival are good?

17:55.344 --> 17:57.186
Excellent.
I'd say the shot

17:57.286 --> 17:59.398
poses virtually no risk
to you at all.

17:59.953 --> 18:00.953
I knew it.

18:01.924 --> 18:02.926
You hear that?

18:03.053 --> 18:05.162
I've got a very prominent
corpus collosum.

18:07.895 --> 18:09.179
I'm not stalling.

18:09.548 --> 18:10.239
Collier's been surrounded
by bodyguards all day. I...

18:10.240 --> 18:11.801
<i>Collier's been surrounded
by bodyguards all day. I...</i>

18:11.911 --> 18:13.252
<i>I can't get
anywhere near him.</i>

18:13.352 --> 18:16.035
- I'm having a hard time believing that.
- <i>It's true.</i>

18:16.226 --> 18:18.037
<i>I don't even know
if I can hurt Collier,</i>

18:18.137 --> 18:19.709
let alone
walk out of here with him.

18:19.809 --> 18:22.027
Isabelle, trust me, you can do
whatever you want to Collier.

18:22.127 --> 18:24.080
If he told you otherwise,
he was bluffing.

18:25.489 --> 18:27.377
<i>You're forgetting
how strong you are,</i>

18:27.648 --> 18:29.320
or maybe you're just
dragging your feet.

18:29.432 --> 18:32.321
Maybe you'd like to pretend you can
still be friends with those people,

18:32.421 --> 18:34.152
<i>that your time in Promise City
actually meant something.</i>

18:34.252 --> 18:35.710
- It did.
- <i>Did it mean more to you</i>

18:35.832 --> 18:37.119
<i>than your father does?</i>

18:38.000 --> 18:40.038
You need to get this done.
You have 24 hours.

18:43.296 --> 18:44.339
What's up?

18:47.359 --> 18:49.302
It's nothing important,
just family stuff.

18:49.913 --> 18:52.270
Your student informant
was a wash.

18:52.581 --> 18:54.779
She called NTAC out here because
she was mad at her professor.

18:54.879 --> 18:56.703
He gave her a "C"
for the semester.

18:57.022 --> 18:59.719
We could go talk to the guy.
Wouldn't hurt to ask some questions.

18:59.819 --> 19:01.835
Like what?
Why he's such a tough grader?

19:02.612 --> 19:04.096
Nah, I think we should head back.

19:04.199 --> 19:05.983
I have to leave
a little early today.

19:13.346 --> 19:14.773
Oh, my god,

19:15.309 --> 19:16.614
you're one of them.

19:17.153 --> 19:18.238
You're marked.

19:18.338 --> 19:20.478
- Is that what they told you?
- Is what who told me?

19:20.578 --> 19:22.532
Skouris, Doyle.
I know they were here.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.645
I just want to finish my movie.

19:25.558 --> 19:28.253
If we wanted you dead, you'd have
been gone a long time ago.

19:28.685 --> 19:30.324
We just need to go over
what they said.

19:30.424 --> 19:31.652
Did they tell you I'm marked?

19:32.037 --> 19:33.971
No, they didn't mention you
at all.

19:34.618 --> 19:37.266
They just asked me how to
get rid of one of those things,

19:37.379 --> 19:39.360
if there's a way
to take a mark out of somebody.

19:42.198 --> 19:44.386
So they're going to try
to save Tom Baldwin.

19:45.099 --> 19:47.578
I don't know, but it's got
nothing to do with me.

19:48.019 --> 19:49.803
I didn't tell them anything!

19:50.993 --> 19:52.975
It's okay.
Look, it's okay.

19:53.397 --> 19:54.740
It's okay...

19:55.144 --> 19:56.928
I'm not mad, Curtis.

19:57.976 --> 19:59.694
We just have to be thorough,
that's all.

20:02.060 --> 20:03.553
What else did they ask you?

20:04.489 --> 20:06.827
Nothing.
That's all we talked about.

20:16.080 --> 20:17.385
Can I go home now?

20:22.370 --> 20:24.126
I told you, I didn't say anything.

20:24.877 --> 20:26.089
What are you doing?

20:26.333 --> 20:27.516
You're a filmmaker.

20:27.672 --> 20:30.012
You should appreciate what
I'm about to do. Call it...

20:30.112 --> 20:31.480
Getting rid of a plot hole.

20:52.894 --> 20:54.462
Tom, what are you doing?

20:55.766 --> 20:57.203
You scared me, Diana.

20:58.332 --> 21:00.209
It's after midnight.
Why are you still here?

21:02.238 --> 21:05.187
I was just down in the theory room,
and now I'm on my way out.

21:07.260 --> 21:08.659
So, what's going on?

21:09.494 --> 21:11.447
Oh, I'm just taking
some work home with me.

21:11.924 --> 21:14.271
- That's a lot of work.
- Yeah.

21:15.206 --> 21:17.162
Well...
Good night, honey.

21:17.611 --> 21:20.465
You know, tom, I can't let you
leave with those files.

21:20.850 --> 21:22.136
Why not?

21:23.311 --> 21:25.099
Okay, yeah, there's some
sensitive stuff in here,

21:25.199 --> 21:26.586
but it's you and me, Diana.

21:26.886 --> 21:29.514
We take work home all the time.
It's no big deal, right?

21:31.671 --> 21:33.549
You know, you're just
so bad at this.

21:34.670 --> 21:37.393
I don't know what lessons you took
in bodysnatching school, but...

21:37.534 --> 21:38.901
you make a terrible Tom Baldwin.

21:39.001 --> 21:40.360
You're so insincere.

21:42.343 --> 21:44.235
Very funny, Diana.
I'd laugh, but it's late...

21:44.404 --> 21:46.488
You're a Marked, Tom.
I know it.

21:47.174 --> 21:48.469
Meghan knows it.

21:53.279 --> 21:55.176
Just for a second,
let's pretend I am.

21:57.318 --> 21:59.779
Do you have any idea
how hard it would be

21:59.879 --> 22:01.750
to pretend you're someone
from this place?

22:02.643 --> 22:04.652
You're all weak, vacillating.

22:05.028 --> 22:06.286
We're human beings.

22:07.699 --> 22:10.582
I... I don't know
how we evolved into you.

22:11.794 --> 22:13.297
Neither do I.

22:13.785 --> 22:15.053
Neither do I.

22:15.456 --> 22:16.799
I mean, look at you, Diana.

22:17.283 --> 22:19.029
You have no idea what you want.

22:19.961 --> 22:22.571
You've driven away every man
who's ever looked at you.

22:22.819 --> 22:26.912
Your daughter hand-delivered you
a fiancé by prophecy,

22:27.999 --> 22:29.727
and you couldn't even
hold onto him.

22:31.377 --> 22:33.602
The longest relationship
you've ever had with a guy?

22:34.044 --> 22:35.161
It's with me.

22:36.200 --> 22:38.059
Your good old buddy, Tom Baldwin.

22:38.397 --> 22:39.768
I am friends with him,

22:41.711 --> 22:43.662
and I'm not even
going to ask him to apologize

22:43.762 --> 22:45.217
once I've burned you out of him.

22:47.898 --> 22:49.190
You should get some rest, Diana.

22:49.290 --> 22:52.131
- You're starting to sound delusional.
- Put the files down now, Tom.

22:59.320 --> 23:00.625
Diana, what...

23:03.153 --> 23:04.233
Fine.

23:31.782 --> 23:32.956
What are you doing here?

23:35.669 --> 23:37.022
You never came to see me.

23:39.483 --> 23:41.605
Oh, sorry,
I got tied up with Jordan.

23:45.052 --> 23:46.226
Are you okay?

23:47.429 --> 23:48.847
I don't want to
be alone tonight.

23:50.932 --> 23:52.735
Well, it's okay,
you can stay here.

23:54.354 --> 23:56.025
And I don't want to talk either.

24:22.962 --> 24:24.971
Are you sure you don't want me
to call a doctor?

24:25.093 --> 24:26.137
I'm fine, Marco.

24:27.400 --> 24:29.275
I just got a call
from the Vancouver police.

24:29.375 --> 24:31.776
Curtis Peck was found murdered
a couple of hours ago.

24:31.904 --> 24:34.073
- Oh, my god.
- They're thinking maybe was a robbery.

24:34.173 --> 24:36.307
I gave them no reason
to believe otherwise.

24:36.925 --> 24:38.752
God knows what he's going to do next.

24:39.635 --> 24:42.057
I don't want to ratchet up
the pressure or anything, but...

24:42.390 --> 24:45.344
If we're going to cure Tom,
we're going to have to do it fast.

24:45.444 --> 24:47.413
My guy was able to get me
a sample of polonium,

24:47.554 --> 24:50.010
but it degrades quickly.
In a couple days, it'll be useless.

24:50.110 --> 24:53.133
Tom knows we're onto him.
There's no way he's coming back to NTAC.

24:54.376 --> 24:56.582
We have to have to find a way
to lure him to us.

24:58.373 --> 24:59.857
I always hated needles.

25:15.956 --> 25:16.998
Are you okay?

25:20.262 --> 25:21.539
Yeah, I feel fine, actually.

25:21.999 --> 25:23.644
That doesn't mean
you're free and clear.

25:23.744 --> 25:25.694
We got to keep an eye on you
for a while, okay?

25:27.982 --> 25:29.202
But I feel good.

25:31.061 --> 25:33.807
You're just wondering what kind
of ability you're going to get.

25:34.343 --> 25:36.550
The world could always use
another healer, right?

26:04.394 --> 26:05.727
Kyle, wake up.

26:12.429 --> 26:13.650
How did you sleep?

26:14.943 --> 26:16.502
I've been awake all night.

26:21.343 --> 26:22.441
I have to go.

26:23.899 --> 26:24.904
It's time.

26:25.702 --> 26:27.026
Time for what?

26:32.657 --> 26:34.619
You're going to go
to sleep for a while,

26:35.093 --> 26:37.393
and when you wake up,
everything's gonna be different.

26:40.172 --> 26:41.872
What are you talking about?

26:48.523 --> 26:49.547
I want you to know,

26:49.988 --> 26:51.903
all the things
I felt for you were real.

26:55.549 --> 26:57.925
This is the only real
friendship I've ever had.

27:03.341 --> 27:04.665
Isabelle, are you okay?

27:43.347 --> 27:45.234
For a while there,
I believed you'd changed.

27:46.154 --> 27:47.225
So did I.

27:51.974 --> 27:53.636
Maia, honey, you need to get up.

27:54.425 --> 27:55.542
How are you feeling?

27:57.045 --> 27:58.538
- A bit better.
- Okay?

27:59.242 --> 28:00.882
I just don't think
I can go to school.

28:01.002 --> 28:03.157
Well, that's okay,
but you need to get dressed,

28:03.272 --> 28:04.595
we need to pack you a little bag,

28:04.715 --> 28:06.484
because we're going
someplace for a while.

28:06.635 --> 28:07.695
Where?

28:08.505 --> 28:10.702
Well, just a hotel.

28:11.491 --> 28:12.684
What happened to your eye?

28:12.804 --> 28:14.270
Well, it's... I'm okay.

28:14.621 --> 28:17.147
We're just going to go to a place,
because it's not safe here.

28:17.363 --> 28:19.062
I don't want to
frighten you, but it's...

28:19.344 --> 28:20.697
It's Tom. He's...

28:21.982 --> 28:25.269
He's just got something bad inside him,
and he's just not himself. All right?

28:26.887 --> 28:28.644
So, come on,
we need to get going.

28:31.330 --> 28:32.532
I don't understand.

28:33.827 --> 28:35.573
That's what Tom said about you.

28:37.018 --> 28:38.135
What?

28:39.478 --> 28:40.605
When?

28:41.525 --> 28:44.289
A couple of days ago,
he picked me up at school.

28:44.965 --> 28:46.064
A couple of days ago?

28:47.109 --> 28:49.315
That was right before
you started feeling sick, right?

28:55.679 --> 28:56.879
Wake him up.

29:09.986 --> 29:11.150
What do you want with me?

29:13.425 --> 29:14.664
Hello, Jordan.

29:16.925 --> 29:19.216
Looks like you and I will be
working together after all.

29:34.747 --> 29:36.597
It won't do you any good
to kill me.

29:37.526 --> 29:39.666
The movement's too strong.
It'll go on without me.

29:40.687 --> 29:42.283
Who said anything
about killing you?

29:43.124 --> 29:44.124
This is a sedative.

29:45.241 --> 29:47.650
We're not going to make you
a martyr to your cause, Jordan.

29:47.770 --> 29:49.457
We're going to make you
a traitor to it.

29:52.580 --> 29:53.895
You're gonna sleep for a while,

29:54.015 --> 29:56.824
and when you wake up,
there's gonna be something inside you,

29:56.976 --> 29:59.952
and in time, you'll come to
think exactly the way we do.

30:00.264 --> 30:01.992
You'll be a brand-new
Jordan Collier...

30:02.112 --> 30:05.358
A man concerned with protecting
the future, instead of destroying it.

30:06.742 --> 30:07.765
You forget,

30:08.047 --> 30:09.700
I've seen the world you created,

30:10.443 --> 30:12.759
and the oceans
were deserts of bone,

30:12.879 --> 30:14.406
fires filled the horizon,

30:15.266 --> 30:16.861
and everywhere I walked,

30:17.478 --> 30:19.895
- there was screaming.
- We inherited that world,

30:20.271 --> 30:21.726
and we managed to survive,

30:22.576 --> 30:24.493
- and even prosper.
- All you people did

30:24.613 --> 30:26.085
was build a wall to hide behind

30:26.205 --> 30:28.436
while the rest of the planet
died around you.

30:30.380 --> 30:31.939
It doesn't matter what you do,

30:32.916 --> 30:34.493
you'll never get your future back.

30:35.933 --> 30:37.520
The world is turning positive.

30:39.723 --> 30:40.859
You're right, Jordan.

30:41.482 --> 30:42.571
We're helpless...

30:44.651 --> 30:45.806
But you're not.

30:47.243 --> 30:49.215
You can take promicin
out of people.

30:50.044 --> 30:51.608
You can turn positives
into negatives.

30:51.728 --> 30:53.878
Your ability, Jordan,
that's how we're going to win.

30:55.202 --> 30:57.916
Once you're marked, you'll gather
all your followers around you,

30:58.036 --> 31:00.782
and then one by one, you're going
to take their abilities away,

31:01.017 --> 31:04.026
and you're not going to stop
until you rid the world of promicin.

31:07.757 --> 31:10.424
Oh, look, Jordan Collier
has nothing to say.

31:13.191 --> 31:14.552
You have to admire the symmetry.

31:15.153 --> 31:17.811
You're going to single-handedly
destroy the movement you created.

31:37.223 --> 31:38.632
You lied to me.

31:40.349 --> 31:43.174
You told me that we need Isabelle.
You said she changed.

31:43.385 --> 31:44.987
I said you had to
bring her to Collier,

31:45.107 --> 31:47.463
that she was a part of all this,
and she is.

31:47.708 --> 31:50.539
She's doing what she has to do.
You need to do the same.

31:50.659 --> 31:53.195
How? Jordan is gone.
Everything is falling apart.

31:53.315 --> 31:54.918
You can't let that happen, Kyle.

31:55.038 --> 31:57.638
Somebody has to be in charge
of Promise City now.

32:00.639 --> 32:01.700
Me?

32:10.894 --> 32:13.289
- Hello?
<i>- Tom, it's me, Maia.</i>

32:13.833 --> 32:15.035
Maia, hi.

32:15.963 --> 32:17.972
- Is everything all right?
<i>- I don't think so.</i>

32:18.330 --> 32:19.419
It's my mom.

32:19.644 --> 32:21.818
I'm worried about her.
She's acting weird.

32:22.278 --> 32:25.049
- Weird how?
- <i>She took me to this hotel.</i>

32:25.169 --> 32:27.360
<i>She said that
there's something wrong with you.</i>

32:28.270 --> 32:29.519
That's not true, Maia.

32:29.735 --> 32:31.951
I'm sorry she told you that.
What else did she say?

32:32.170 --> 32:33.334
<i>Nothing.</i>

32:34.152 --> 32:35.326
Don't get mad,

32:35.890 --> 32:38.914
but when you came to see me,
I didn't tell the truth.

32:39.584 --> 32:41.509
I did have a vision last week.

32:41.972 --> 32:43.465
You and my mom were in it.

32:43.897 --> 32:45.062
It was bad.

32:45.335 --> 32:47.823
<i>It's okay, Maia, whatever it is,
it hasn't happened yet.</i>

32:48.062 --> 32:49.565
<i>Just tell me what you saw.</i>

32:49.957 --> 32:53.083
My mom, she had a gun,
and you guys were arguing.

32:54.279 --> 32:55.556
Then she shot you.

32:56.741 --> 32:58.747
<i>I didn't say anything
when you came to see me,</i>

32:58.867 --> 33:01.084
<i>because I didn't think
it was gonna come true.</i>

33:01.826 --> 33:03.923
But now I'm not so sure.

33:04.981 --> 33:06.869
Where did this happen, Maia?
I need details.

33:06.989 --> 33:08.202
<i>I couldn't tell.</i>

33:09.115 --> 33:11.218
<i>She'd be so mad
if she knew I was calling you.</i>

33:12.891 --> 33:14.139
Be careful, okay?

33:14.365 --> 33:16.928
And please,
don't do anything to hurt her.

33:17.180 --> 33:19.556
Just tell me what the place
looked like, Maia, just...

33:34.058 --> 33:35.335
You missed lunch.

33:36.345 --> 33:37.396
I did?

33:39.842 --> 33:41.063
Is it still day?

33:42.349 --> 33:43.889
It's 3:00 in the afternoon.

33:47.310 --> 33:50.014
Kevin, I know you're busy
with your test, but...

33:51.642 --> 33:53.166
It seems,
ever since Shawn healed me,

33:53.286 --> 33:54.644
I never see you anymore.

33:57.330 --> 33:58.382
Are you avoiding me?

34:06.711 --> 34:07.894
Actually, yes.

34:09.485 --> 34:10.678
As much as possible.

34:11.016 --> 34:12.087
Why?

34:12.987 --> 34:14.536
Because you're healthy now,

34:15.842 --> 34:16.904
and...

34:17.585 --> 34:18.637
you're young,

34:19.259 --> 34:22.967
and... I'm not exactly
either of those things.

34:24.846 --> 34:26.828
You don't need me
to take care of you anymore,

34:26.947 --> 34:29.400
so I'm trying to...

34:30.570 --> 34:31.570
Give you space.

34:35.235 --> 34:37.357
How could you be so brilliant,

34:37.705 --> 34:39.009
and so clueless?

34:41.116 --> 34:42.731
Why would I want space?

34:45.270 --> 34:47.299
Where am I going to find
another you?

34:50.813 --> 34:52.014
Well...

34:52.724 --> 34:54.460
I suppose that would be a challenge.

35:10.466 --> 35:11.661
I'd like you...

35:12.476 --> 35:14.382
to go visit
your grandniece again.

35:14.861 --> 35:16.684
It's not safe here anymore.

35:16.804 --> 35:19.951
I'm a target, as long as
you're with me, you wille be too.

35:21.534 --> 35:22.783
And when this is over,

35:23.685 --> 35:25.516
when I perfect the test,

35:27.529 --> 35:28.628
I'll come find you.

35:30.296 --> 35:31.845
How do I know that you will?

35:32.023 --> 35:33.225
How could I not?

35:36.064 --> 35:37.998
Where would I find another you?

36:33.002 --> 36:34.401
Don't move, Tom.

36:38.305 --> 36:40.098
Put the gun down
or I will shoot you.

36:53.738 --> 36:54.845
Meghan, please...

36:56.501 --> 36:57.853
Meghan, honey, it's me.

37:00.203 --> 37:01.658
Please, you have to help me.

37:03.657 --> 37:06.812
This thing inside me,
I'm trying to fight it...

37:09.481 --> 37:11.904
But it hurts...
sometimes it hurts so much.

37:12.120 --> 37:14.807
Get down on the floor and put
your hands behind your head.

37:18.909 --> 37:19.952
Oh, god!

37:23.316 --> 37:24.387
Tom, freeze!

37:24.946 --> 37:26.068
Freeze, Tom!

38:34.796 --> 38:36.138
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

38:36.298 --> 38:37.500
You're welcome.

38:38.266 --> 38:40.264
Do you think your brother
looks a little thin?

38:40.384 --> 38:42.582
Tired?
I'm worried about him.

38:42.702 --> 38:44.877
Mom, I didn't come here
to talk about Shawn.

38:46.486 --> 38:48.054
There's something
I want to tell you.

38:49.202 --> 38:50.291
I took the shot.

38:52.848 --> 38:54.472
Mom, it worked out.
I'm fine.

38:55.852 --> 38:57.148
I was afraid you would.

38:58.304 --> 39:00.886
As soon as I heard about that test
your brother's working on,

39:01.006 --> 39:03.684
- I knew you'd be first in line.
- Mom, this is a good thing.

39:04.235 --> 39:06.395
The world is changing.
There are miracles out there.

39:06.864 --> 39:09.794
- I'm going to be part of it now.
- Just like your brother's part of it.

39:10.020 --> 39:11.297
Yeah, I guess.

39:12.027 --> 39:14.227
I mean, why should he
have a gift and not me, right?

39:17.843 --> 39:18.942
Mom, you okay?

39:21.055 --> 39:22.173
Mom, what's wrong?

39:22.314 --> 39:23.609
Mom!

39:25.263 --> 39:26.642
Just... someone, help, please!

39:27.000 --> 39:28.145
Mom, no!

39:59.526 --> 40:01.657
- Where did he go?
- I guess he went around back.

40:42.332 --> 40:43.468
Don't move!

40:44.792 --> 40:45.792
Drop the gun.

40:47.371 --> 40:48.526
Don't make me shoot you.

40:54.957 --> 40:56.327
You going to fix me, Diana?

40:58.126 --> 40:59.386
Gonna get your old Tom back?

41:00.385 --> 41:02.000
How do you think
that'll help things?

41:03.929 --> 41:06.155
I'm a better NTAC agent now
than I've ever been.

41:07.172 --> 41:08.407
Ever since I...

41:08.848 --> 41:11.139
- re-evaluated things...
- Put your hands in the air!

41:12.758 --> 41:14.073
Keep them where I can see them.

41:18.892 --> 41:20.110
I've made more progress

41:20.230 --> 41:23.230
against Jordan Collier and promicin
than we made in a year.

41:24.399 --> 41:26.633
We're winning now, Di.
Isn't that what you want?

41:26.821 --> 41:27.920
Not like this.

41:29.295 --> 41:30.521
You killed Curtis Peck,

41:30.641 --> 41:33.230
you put my daughter on the inhibitor...
My daughter, Tom.

41:36.124 --> 41:37.561
You still call me by that name.

41:39.756 --> 41:42.818
Deep down, you must know we're still
partners, that we're on the same side.

41:45.924 --> 41:47.652
Tell you what
I'm going to do now, Diana.

41:47.772 --> 41:49.732
I'm going to turn around,
walk out that door,

41:49.852 --> 41:51.645
and you won't be able
to pull that trigger.

41:51.765 --> 41:53.294
Goddammit, Tom, stop!
