WEBVTT

00:00.033 --> 00:01.694
I want to hire you.
What?

00:01.718 --> 00:02.777
Here's your client.

00:02.852 --> 00:04.753
You want to hire me
for a fish?

00:07.091 --> 00:09.821
Two witnesses, one of them's
unconscious, the other one can't talk.

00:09.894 --> 00:13.227
Unless we find Kele, it's only a
matter of days before she will be dead.

00:13.297 --> 00:16.265
Maybe we can get an undercover
mahi-mahi to find his hideout.

00:16.334 --> 00:18.029
It's just
a token gesture.

00:18.402 --> 00:19.426
Did you bring the money?

00:19.503 --> 00:20.993
Let me handle this, will ya?
Please.

02:16.973 --> 02:20.602
Good boy, Kele!
Good boy!

02:56.813 --> 02:58.713
Okay, you two love birds.

03:02.752 --> 03:04.743
Good, Kele! Good, lpo!

03:06.923 --> 03:08.083
Chow-chow time!

03:11.127 --> 03:13.960
Take it easy.
There's plenty left for you.

03:22.138 --> 03:23.662
What's the matter, Kele?

03:27.844 --> 03:29.869
What's wrong, guys?

03:53.069 --> 03:54.536
Will you look
at this haircut?

03:54.604 --> 03:56.572
And he really does have an upper lip.

03:56.639 --> 03:57.628
Give me that.

03:57.707 --> 03:58.731
No, no, no, no.

03:58.808 --> 04:00.605
Come on,
I'm gonna be late.

04:01.611 --> 04:04.637
Whoa, looky here.
Captain of the football team.

04:04.714 --> 04:07.410
That was the year we took the
Virginia State Championships.

04:08.651 --> 04:10.380
Hey, is that her?

04:10.453 --> 04:11.477
Huh?

04:11.554 --> 04:14.318
That's Veronica Hamilton,
the prom queen.

04:14.390 --> 04:17.086
Oh, no, no. I've got her.
Right here. What?

04:18.226 --> 04:19.524
What a knockout!

04:20.062 --> 04:22.997
That's Amy. Amy Ascot,
the head cheerleader.

04:24.033 --> 04:25.898
Man, this book is bogus.

04:25.968 --> 04:29.267
Nobody, but nobody,
has this kind of life in high school.

04:29.338 --> 04:32.068
Oh, come on, guys,
it wasn't perfect.

04:32.141 --> 04:34.268
I went to classes,
I did homework.

04:34.343 --> 04:36.573
Now, come on,
nobody asked you to look at that thing.

04:36.646 --> 04:38.705
I don't have time
for these dumb games.

04:38.781 --> 04:40.339
Where's my keys?
Where's my keys?

04:42.485 --> 04:43.611
Oh, come on, Rick,
give me my keys.

04:43.686 --> 04:47.122
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Not until we have seen her.

04:47.190 --> 04:49.215
All right, Goldie Morris.

04:49.292 --> 04:51.658
Well, she's right there
on the end.

04:53.262 --> 04:54.422
Hey, pretty cute.

04:54.497 --> 04:55.521
Yeah.

04:56.899 --> 04:59.390
No, the other end.
The one with the glasses.

05:07.476 --> 05:10.912
Well, I bet she's got
a great personality.

05:11.180 --> 05:13.011
I bet she's real smart.

05:13.082 --> 05:15.141
Smart? Yeah, I guess.

05:15.218 --> 05:16.981
As a matter of fact,
if she hadn't tutored me,

05:17.053 --> 05:18.384
I would've flunked
out of English...

05:18.487 --> 05:20.512
I would've
flunked out of English Lit.

05:20.590 --> 05:21.955
I would've been
ineligible for football.

05:22.024 --> 05:24.015
I would've lost my
appointment for Annapolis.

05:24.093 --> 05:25.651
I owe her.
She's been a good friend.

05:25.728 --> 05:27.889
I'm not gonna let anybody
make me keep her waiting.

05:29.398 --> 05:30.558
Hi, Higgins.
Bye, Higgins.

05:30.633 --> 05:33.466
You're not leaving. That is not
a question, it's a statement.

05:33.536 --> 05:35.299
Although it normally
goes against my grain

05:35.371 --> 05:37.805
to be in any way obligated to you,
something has...

05:37.873 --> 05:38.897
Listen to this.

05:41.477 --> 05:43.672
"For each ecstatic instant

05:43.746 --> 05:45.839
"We must anguish pay

05:45.915 --> 05:48.406
"ln keen and quivering ratio

05:48.484 --> 05:49.781
"To the ecstasy"

05:51.454 --> 05:53.513
Emily Dickinson.
As I was saying...

05:53.589 --> 05:55.386
She's in Hawaii, too?

05:55.458 --> 05:57.119
Emily Dickinson,
American poet,

05:57.193 --> 06:00.560
Iong since deceased,
and the author of those exquisite words.

06:00.630 --> 06:04.657
Sorry, but the author of this hot
little poem is very much alive.

06:04.734 --> 06:07.134
One Goldie Morris.

06:07.203 --> 06:08.534
Who I'm supposed
to be meeting

06:08.604 --> 06:10.902
at the Wailele Hotel
in 10 minutes.

06:11.407 --> 06:14.638
"Ecstasy"? Wait a minute.
Let me see that.

06:17.113 --> 06:19.081
Just an old school chum,
huh?

06:19.148 --> 06:20.843
lmpossible.

06:20.916 --> 06:22.440
Magnum's friends
are seldom literate,

06:22.518 --> 06:25.487
Iet alone capable of
quoting Emily Dickinson.

06:25.921 --> 06:28.014
"Keen and quivering"?
I don't remember seeing that.

06:28.090 --> 06:29.182
Magnum, I'm trying
to talk to you.

06:29.258 --> 06:30.850
Whatever it is,
I'll take care of it later.

06:30.926 --> 06:32.188
It is very important!

06:32.261 --> 06:33.285
I promise.

06:33.362 --> 06:35.227
I'm willing to negotiate.

06:39.435 --> 06:40.663
Negotiate?

06:40.736 --> 06:43.330
Privileges.
Wine cellar, tennis courts,

06:43.406 --> 06:45.966
use of the new satellite dish.
Whatever it takes.

06:46.042 --> 06:47.236
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

06:47.310 --> 06:48.834
I thought you
never negotiated.

06:48.911 --> 06:50.003
I thought that was some
kind of rule of yours...

06:50.079 --> 06:52.343
Ordinarily that is
most emphatically be true.

06:52.415 --> 06:55.441
However, this is a matter
of supreme urgency.

06:56.285 --> 06:59.220
Well? Name your price.

07:01.657 --> 07:02.954
Well, no, Higgins.

07:03.025 --> 07:06.290
If it's that important
and you really want my help,

07:07.496 --> 07:09.760
then I don't want anything.

07:09.832 --> 07:10.958
Good.

07:11.734 --> 07:12.860
Now, then.

07:13.235 --> 07:14.600
I have received
an invitation

07:14.670 --> 07:17.468
from the lnternational Human
Rights Advisory Council.

07:17.540 --> 07:20.475
And the yacht on which the reception
and meeting are to take place

07:20.543 --> 07:23.239
belongs to President Kole
of West Senanga.

07:23.979 --> 07:27.346
That must be that 100-footer that's
anchored off the Alihi Harbor.

07:27.416 --> 07:29.475
Can you imagine
what that boat must cost?

07:29.552 --> 07:32.715
Not as much as that party
he threw for his inauguration,

07:32.788 --> 07:35.120
and half of his people
starving to death.

07:35.925 --> 07:38.758
If I was Kole, I wouldn't set
foot off that yacht, either.

07:38.828 --> 07:40.386
He's not a very popular guy.

07:40.463 --> 07:41.589
Indeed.

07:41.997 --> 07:43.521
As a matter of fact,
the Advisory Council

07:43.599 --> 07:45.897
chose the meeting site
for security reasons.

07:45.968 --> 07:49.028
And since West Senanga was
once a British protectorate,

07:49.105 --> 07:52.074
the Prime Minister is hesitant to
send an official representative

07:52.141 --> 07:55.133
for fear of appearing to
endorse Kole's dictatorship.

07:55.211 --> 07:58.578
Yet the Council's goals
are too admirable to ignore,

07:58.647 --> 08:01.047
so the consulate
has asked me to attend.

08:01.117 --> 08:03.551
As an unofficial
representative, of course.

08:04.220 --> 08:05.278
Of course.

08:05.354 --> 08:07.254
And even as I know
it is my duty to attend,

08:07.323 --> 08:11.123
I find President Kole
so contemptible that...

08:12.628 --> 08:15.222
Well, it's a very
difficult decision.

08:15.898 --> 08:19.527
So you want me to help you
through the moral ambiguities

08:19.602 --> 08:22.127
and the contradictions
of this difficult situation.

08:24.039 --> 08:26.030
Don't be ridiculous, Magnum.

08:26.108 --> 08:28.838
Since I will be very busy
reviewing the meeting's agenda,

08:28.911 --> 08:32.438
I want you to deliver my security
clearance and letters of introduction

08:32.515 --> 08:34.346
to President Kole's yacht.

08:36.352 --> 08:37.477
Oh.

08:46.495 --> 08:48.122
Your attention, please.

08:48.197 --> 08:51.064
The Advisory Council meeting
on agricultural aid

08:51.133 --> 08:53.260
has been changed
to 4:00 p.m. in the...

08:53.335 --> 08:55.633
Mr. Wanda,
does your presence here

08:55.704 --> 08:57.695
signal a softening
in your attitude

08:57.773 --> 08:59.434
toward President Kole
and his policies?

08:59.508 --> 09:02.409
No. I did not come here
to shake hands with the devil.

09:02.478 --> 09:06.039
We've heard rumors of a secret trade
agreement between your two countries.

09:06.115 --> 09:07.548
Trade agreement!

09:07.616 --> 09:10.050
My country sends
food and clothing,

09:10.286 --> 09:12.447
while Kole throws
lavish banquets

09:12.521 --> 09:14.580
to celebrate
his recent free election.

09:14.657 --> 09:16.249
His countrymen are starving.

09:16.325 --> 09:17.349
Mr. Wanda...

09:17.426 --> 09:21.362
Food, from this country,
countries all over the world,

09:21.430 --> 09:23.728
is sitting on the docks
rotting,

09:23.799 --> 09:27.394
and Kole has no plans to
distribute that food to his people.

09:27.970 --> 09:30.029
Now, I'm here
to find the Advisory Council.

09:30.105 --> 09:31.129
I had to admit,

09:31.207 --> 09:35.268
I was a little nervous about seeing
Goldie again after all these years.

09:35.344 --> 09:36.743
But one thing
I wasn't worried about

09:36.812 --> 09:39.372
was whether
I'd recognize her or not.

09:39.448 --> 09:42.645
There was a bond between us.
A history.

09:43.085 --> 09:45.986
A camaraderie that went
beyond the physical.

09:46.055 --> 09:48.546
It was a spiritual
sort of thing.

09:50.559 --> 09:51.890
Thomas?

09:53.863 --> 09:56.195
Goldie? Goldie Morris?

09:56.265 --> 09:57.323
Yes!

10:00.569 --> 10:01.558
Here.

10:05.407 --> 10:06.897
Oh, aloha.

10:07.276 --> 10:08.470
Oh.

10:13.983 --> 10:15.712
Oh, Thomas.

10:17.553 --> 10:20.545
You look the same.
But different.

10:20.856 --> 10:24.155
Oh, it's the mustache.
You look different, too.

10:24.226 --> 10:25.488
No mustache, I hope.

10:26.695 --> 10:28.686
No, it's something else.

10:29.765 --> 10:31.665
Oh, my hair's a lot longer.

10:31.734 --> 10:32.894
No, no.

10:33.269 --> 10:35.237
I know, it's your nose!

10:36.939 --> 10:39.203
It's your hair. It's...
No, it's definitely your hair.

10:43.078 --> 10:45.911
I didn't get
a nose job, exactly.

10:47.583 --> 10:51.417
It got broken by a flying rock
in the Chicago riots of '68

10:51.487 --> 10:54.320
and a real nice cop
pushed it back in place.

10:54.657 --> 10:57.626
I think Sergeant McDougall
did a swell job, don't you?

10:58.994 --> 11:00.359
Yeah, swell.

11:02.565 --> 11:04.999
But it's not just the nose.

11:05.067 --> 11:08.559
I lost 30 pounds running in a
bunch of marathons against hunger.

11:08.637 --> 11:12.095
Oh, and those braces
came off.

11:16.111 --> 11:18.636
And my eye, this one...

11:18.714 --> 11:21.342
Remember how it always
sort of drifted a little?

11:21.417 --> 11:25.513
Well, I grew out of it and now I only
have to wear glasses for reading.

11:25.788 --> 11:27.585
Oh, well, you look great.

11:28.157 --> 11:29.385
Thanks.

11:29.758 --> 11:33.319
I think it's pretty exciting,
your being a private investigator.

11:33.395 --> 11:35.363
Well, it has its moments.

11:35.431 --> 11:38.161
What kind of a case
are you working on now?

11:39.001 --> 11:41.731
Well, I have to deliver
these very important documents

11:41.804 --> 11:43.704
for the British government.

11:43.772 --> 11:46.866
Oh! I'm very impressed.

11:48.077 --> 11:50.671
But I really can't
talk about it much.

12:04.960 --> 12:06.052
I'll be right back,

12:06.128 --> 12:07.527
and then we can have the
rest of the day to ourselves.

12:07.596 --> 12:08.688
Great!

12:22.211 --> 12:23.701
Stop!

12:28.083 --> 12:29.710
Your business?

12:31.787 --> 12:34.915
I have a security clearance
and a letter of introduction.

12:59.214 --> 13:01.307
All done. What do you say
we get some lunch?

13:01.383 --> 13:02.816
Only if I can have
some of those purple drinks

13:02.885 --> 13:04.546
with the silly little
umbrellas.

13:04.620 --> 13:05.678
Oh, you got it.

13:11.927 --> 13:13.622
Thomas, do you know
what that is?

13:13.696 --> 13:16.062
Look, I mean, Goldie, you can get
the drinks without the umbrellas.

13:16.131 --> 13:17.530
That's the flag
of West Senanga.

13:17.599 --> 13:18.759
Yeah.

13:23.539 --> 13:25.530
You work for President Kole?

13:25.607 --> 13:27.973
What? Oh, no...

13:28.043 --> 13:30.409
Thomas, how could you?

13:30.479 --> 13:33.710
What?
Goldie, what's going on?

13:33.782 --> 13:36.512
Where are you going?
Goldie?

13:37.986 --> 13:40.147
I'm not working
for President Kole.

13:40.222 --> 13:41.951
You're not working
against him, either.

13:42.024 --> 13:43.252
How can you say that?
Just because...

13:43.325 --> 13:44.553
I can say that.

13:44.626 --> 13:46.457
Do you know how many
demonstrations... No, let me finish!

13:46.528 --> 13:49.656
...I've been in against that monster?
Now, come on. Let me finish. Please!

13:49.732 --> 13:51.962
Now look, just 'cause I'm
not demonstrating against him

13:52.034 --> 13:54.161
doesn't mean
I agree with the guy.

13:54.236 --> 13:57.364
I mean, you've gotta admit it's a good
thing he's here for these meetings.

13:57.439 --> 13:59.202
It's all a smokescreen.

13:59.274 --> 14:01.105
It's just
a token gesture.

14:02.277 --> 14:04.541
How can you be sure
it won't do any good?

14:04.613 --> 14:07.081
I don't think men like Kole
should be given any more chances.

14:07.149 --> 14:09.879
You're just like you were in
high school, do you know that?

14:09.952 --> 14:12.182
Anybody who disagrees with you
is a bad guy.

14:12.254 --> 14:13.346
Are you defending Kole?

14:13.422 --> 14:15.287
No. I don't like him
any more than you do,

14:15.357 --> 14:18.190
but at least they got him talking.
That's something.

14:18.260 --> 14:20.455
Of course, it's not as dramatic
as running in marathons

14:20.529 --> 14:22.394
or ducking rocks in riots.

14:22.464 --> 14:25.228
But it's a hell of a lot
more constructive.

14:34.476 --> 14:35.602
Thomas!

14:37.679 --> 14:41.308
Thomas! Thomas.
Let's not fight.

14:41.383 --> 14:43.908
Oh, sometimes
you make me so mad.

14:43.986 --> 14:45.351
I always did.

14:45.420 --> 14:48.947
Remember back in high school when I
campaigned to outlaw football games?

14:49.024 --> 14:51.424
Remember?
Yes, I remember!

14:51.493 --> 14:53.017
You felt football
was uncivilized,

14:53.095 --> 14:55.120
that it encouraged students
to acts of violence

14:55.197 --> 14:57.961
rather than rational
intellectual discussion.

14:58.033 --> 15:00.900
So at half-time
during the homecoming game,

15:02.638 --> 15:04.868
you burned down
the goal posts.

15:05.841 --> 15:07.433
It was a symbolic act.

15:07.509 --> 15:09.409
We had to forfeit the game!

15:09.478 --> 15:12.413
I couldn't get them to listen
any other way.

15:14.383 --> 15:15.441
Okay, Thomas.

15:15.517 --> 15:18.975
No more causes today.
I swear.

15:20.722 --> 15:23.589
It's not that
I'm against causes, per se.

15:23.659 --> 15:25.422
I mean, I have
my own set of standards,

15:25.494 --> 15:27.553
a certain code of conduct
in the way I work.

15:27.629 --> 15:29.062
I'm sure you do.

15:29.131 --> 15:31.361
And I'll bet you're
real good at your job.

15:31.433 --> 15:32.661
Pretty good.

15:32.734 --> 15:35.294
Do you find missing people?
Missing things?

15:35.370 --> 15:36.962
On my good days.

15:37.406 --> 15:38.737
I want to hire you.

15:39.274 --> 15:40.263
What?

15:40.342 --> 15:43.038
Oh, it's not for me.
Here's your client.

15:44.546 --> 15:45.740
A fish?

15:45.981 --> 15:48.575
A dolphin is a mammal,
not a fish.

15:48.650 --> 15:50.140
I know that.

15:52.521 --> 15:54.751
You want to hire me
for a fish?

15:58.493 --> 16:01.826
Ever since Kele's gone,
lpo has refused to eat.

16:02.698 --> 16:05.997
Kele was her mate.
He was kidnapped yesterday.

16:06.735 --> 16:11.035
Well, I'm not sure you can kidnap
a dolphin. Maybe you can steal one.

16:12.140 --> 16:14.506
That's exactly
what the police said.

16:14.576 --> 16:16.043
Unless you just
happen to be human,

16:16.111 --> 16:18.739
you're nothing but
somebody's property.

16:20.182 --> 16:21.945
So Kele ends up
at the bottom of a list

16:22.017 --> 16:24.485
with hot stereos
and stolen jewelry.

16:25.287 --> 16:26.584
Hardly high priority.

16:26.655 --> 16:28.646
Well, except to lpo.

16:28.724 --> 16:32.683
Unless we find Kele, it's only a
matter of days before she'll be dead.

16:36.164 --> 16:37.722
Why does she keep
making that noise?

16:37.799 --> 16:40.825
Well, that's her way of calling
for Kele when he was here.

16:40.903 --> 16:42.427
She's still calling.

16:52.428 --> 16:54.953
So you didn't see
the kidnappers'...

16:55.298 --> 16:56.526
Their faces?

16:57.033 --> 17:00.093
Well, I was unconscious
before I could turn around.

17:00.169 --> 17:01.830
Kele tried to warn me.

17:01.904 --> 17:03.929
He's a very
intelligent animal.

17:04.006 --> 17:05.803
Goldie and Kele
had a special relationship

17:05.875 --> 17:08.069
from the first day
she came to work here.

17:08.144 --> 17:10.578
But of course,
Goldie's told you all of that.

17:10.646 --> 17:11.670
Of course.

17:11.747 --> 17:12.941
Well, even after
the police told us

17:13.015 --> 17:14.482
there was little
that we could do,

17:14.550 --> 17:18.008
Goldie never gave up,
certain that you would find Kele.

17:19.387 --> 17:21.720
Now I must try
to get lpo to eat.

17:23.626 --> 17:25.526
I'll go feed the seals.

17:30.099 --> 17:33.591
Exactly how long
have you been on the island?

17:33.669 --> 17:34.693
That's not important.

17:34.770 --> 17:37.398
It is important.
You could've called!

17:37.506 --> 17:38.939
I had this job to do.

17:42.712 --> 17:45.112
How could I have fallen
for this tourist charade?

17:45.181 --> 17:49.015
You never went on vacation.
You went on crusades!

17:50.419 --> 17:51.909
Animal liberation.

17:51.988 --> 17:53.216
What?

17:53.289 --> 17:55.223
Animal liberation.

17:55.291 --> 17:58.454
I took this job so I could
set Kele and lpo free.

18:01.497 --> 18:05.661
Goldie, it doesn't look like
such a bad life to me.

18:05.735 --> 18:07.896
I mean, Makini seems
to really care about them.

18:07.970 --> 18:09.631
They get all the fish
they can eat.

18:09.705 --> 18:12.003
It isn't the same
as being free.

18:12.975 --> 18:14.772
Since I've been working here,

18:14.844 --> 18:17.472
I've learned that dolphins
born and raised in captivity

18:17.546 --> 18:20.140
don't stand a chance
out there in the ocean.

18:20.216 --> 18:22.582
So Mission Liberty
was scrapped.

18:22.652 --> 18:24.552
"Mission Liberty"?

18:24.620 --> 18:27.783
Well, if you called it off,
where the hell is Kele?

18:27.857 --> 18:31.452
I don't know.
But we've got to find him.

18:31.861 --> 18:32.885
We?

18:32.962 --> 18:35.328
Well, I didn't want to get you
involved in all this, Thomas.

18:35.398 --> 18:39.357
That's why I didn't call.
But you're our only hope.

18:39.835 --> 18:41.530
Nowhere else to turn.

18:44.507 --> 18:46.839
Remember how much you wanted
to pass English Literature?

18:46.909 --> 18:49.469
No, I needed
to pass English Lit.

18:49.545 --> 18:52.036
I wanted to play football.

18:52.114 --> 18:54.776
Even though I disapproved
of football,

18:54.850 --> 18:57.683
I stayed every day
after school to tutor you.

18:59.388 --> 19:00.878
Please, Thomas?

19:05.695 --> 19:08.562
Do you see that?
Do you see that out there?

19:09.498 --> 19:15.130
That's 70 million square miles
of Pacific Ocean out there.

19:15.838 --> 19:20.468
Makini thinks that Kele will
stay near where he's released

19:20.543 --> 19:22.101
at least for a few days.

19:22.178 --> 19:23.611
Oh, really?
Oh, that's great.

19:23.679 --> 19:27.115
Maybe we can get an undercover
mahi-mahi to find his hideout.

19:27.183 --> 19:29.481
If we find whoever it was
that set Kele free,

19:29.552 --> 19:31.850
they can show us exactly
where he was released.

19:31.921 --> 19:33.013
How're we going to do that?

19:33.089 --> 19:35.250
There's only two witnesses and
one of them was unconscious

19:35.324 --> 19:36.757
and the other one can't talk.

19:38.928 --> 19:42.022
Well, I guess that
what you need is

19:42.098 --> 19:44.464
somebody who might
be involved.

19:48.304 --> 19:50.238
You know who took Kele.

19:51.807 --> 19:52.899
Yeah.

19:52.975 --> 19:54.465
Your partners.

19:54.543 --> 19:57.444
I was very active
in the animal rights movement.

19:57.513 --> 19:59.413
They recruited her!

19:59.482 --> 20:02.679
Well, somebody had to be
in the park to get the keys.

20:03.319 --> 20:06.311
So they brought the keys back and
they went back to the mainland.

20:06.388 --> 20:08.322
They wouldn't have let Kele go,
knowing the risks.

20:08.390 --> 20:11.450
Unless they figured
the end justified the means.

20:12.161 --> 20:14.186
You mean, like me
and the goal post bonfire?

20:14.263 --> 20:15.560
Exactly.

20:18.467 --> 20:20.435
Have you told the police
about these friends?

20:20.503 --> 20:21.731
Thomas, I can't do that.

20:21.804 --> 20:25.672
They're very heavily into civil
disobedience, if you know what I mean.

20:25.741 --> 20:27.834
But they're only
for the very best causes

20:27.910 --> 20:29.605
and they're completely
nonviolent.

20:29.678 --> 20:33.239
Oh, and if we tell the police
about these nonviolent,

20:33.315 --> 20:36.307
extremely well-intentioned friends
of yours, we'll scare them off.

20:36.385 --> 20:38.717
We can't find Kele
any other way.

20:40.089 --> 20:42.853
Believe me, I feel
really bad about this.

20:45.127 --> 20:47.687
But I guess they just got
so involved in the cause,

20:47.763 --> 20:50.994
that they let their emotions
cloud their judgment.

20:51.066 --> 20:52.897
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

20:52.968 --> 20:56.233
We're gonna give these friends of
yours one chance to give Kele back

20:56.305 --> 20:58.136
and then we're going to the police.
You understand?

20:59.508 --> 21:01.908
Okay. Yeah.

21:02.278 --> 21:04.473
I'm sorry, we're out of fish.

21:04.713 --> 21:07.147
Where would they be staying if they
didn't go back to the mainland?

21:07.216 --> 21:08.547
We were all staying
at the same hotel,

21:08.617 --> 21:11.848
but they haven't answered my
messages since Kele's been gone.

21:11.921 --> 21:14.651
Well, maybe an in-person
visit will help.

21:15.724 --> 21:17.021
Let's go.

21:18.194 --> 21:19.786
Goldie, hold it.

21:26.969 --> 21:28.766
There's something a
little frightening about a girl

21:28.838 --> 21:32.740
who can't keep her own shoelaces tied,
trying to save the world.

21:33.108 --> 21:35.167
You know she's bound
to spend the rest of her life

21:35.244 --> 21:38.873
tripping over her ideals
just like those shoelaces.

21:38.948 --> 21:42.349
But you also know there's no way
to talk her out of her causes.

21:42.418 --> 21:45.114
So all you can do
is follow along,

21:45.187 --> 21:49.521
keep her path clear, her shoelaces tied,
and hope for the best.

21:50.059 --> 21:52.755
Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones
checked out this morning.

21:54.563 --> 21:57.555
Could you check and see if they
left a message for Miss Morris?

21:57.633 --> 21:58.930
I'll check.

21:59.802 --> 22:01.793
Smith and Jones.

22:02.304 --> 22:04.670
Cover names.
A lot of people use them.

22:04.740 --> 22:08.574
Yeah, well, maybe they left a
message under your "cover name."

22:08.844 --> 22:12.371
Anything I do, Thomas,
I take full responsibility for.

22:12.448 --> 22:13.915
Oh, I know that.

22:13.983 --> 22:16.952
Listen, how long have you
known these trusted allies?

22:17.019 --> 22:18.680
A week.
A whole week?

22:18.754 --> 22:19.880
Sometimes a week is enough.

22:19.955 --> 22:21.855
And sometimes it isn't.

22:22.057 --> 22:23.490
No messages for you,
Miss Morris,

22:23.559 --> 22:26.585
but there are several
in your box for a Mr. Magnum.

22:26.662 --> 22:30.029
They're all urgent
and from the same man.

22:30.499 --> 22:32.990
I've been trying
to reach you since it arrived.

22:33.068 --> 22:34.160
It's a ransom note
all right.

22:34.236 --> 22:35.567
How'd they get
their paws on it?

22:35.638 --> 22:37.936
I was on my way to
the consul general's office

22:38.007 --> 22:41.170
to receive final instruction
regarding this afternoon's meeting,

22:41.243 --> 22:43.040
when I saw the lads
with this.

22:44.280 --> 22:48.114
The note was wrapped around it and
it was thrown over the compound gate.

22:49.218 --> 22:51.516
Looks like your friends
were following us.

22:51.587 --> 22:55.455
Congratulations, guys. Your doggie
smootz removed any fingerprints.

22:55.524 --> 22:59.255
I can assure you the lads had no
intention of subverting justice.

22:59.895 --> 23:03.695
Kidnapping was just a word I
used with Makini and the police.

23:03.933 --> 23:06.231
There was never
going to be any ransom.

23:06.302 --> 23:08.702
We were here to free
Kele and lpo.

23:10.105 --> 23:12.471
Free the dolphins
from Moana Park?

23:12.841 --> 23:16.174
Goldie is very active in the
animal liberation movement.

23:17.579 --> 23:18.944
Miss Morris, I thought
that you would be

23:19.014 --> 23:21.812
of a more mature
and thoughtful nature.

23:21.884 --> 23:23.715
I understood you were
a student of great literature,

23:23.786 --> 23:26.721
a lover of poetry,
a lover of Emily Dickinson.

23:27.056 --> 23:30.253
The very idea of your involvement
in such a dubious adventure

23:30.326 --> 23:32.055
shocks and disturbs me.

23:32.127 --> 23:33.890
Well, I'm sorry
that you feel that way,

23:34.663 --> 23:37.427
but I think that animals
have certain rights.

23:37.499 --> 23:39.364
I couldn't agree with you more.
Nevertheless...

23:39.435 --> 23:41.767
Rights that include
not being caged up

23:41.837 --> 23:43.930
and tortured in the name
of medical science.

23:44.006 --> 23:46.531
No one here would advocate torture.
However...

23:46.608 --> 23:48.508
And who's going
to be their voice?

23:48.577 --> 23:50.204
Who's going to speak
for them?

23:50.279 --> 23:53.442
They can't tell us when they're in pain.
When they're lonely.

23:53.515 --> 23:54.573
Naturally not,

23:54.650 --> 23:57.619
but the welfare of the human
species must also be considered.

23:57.686 --> 24:00.587
Certainly the gains in medicine
and science due to animal research

24:00.656 --> 24:01.884
cannot be underestimated.

24:01.957 --> 24:04.255
Neither can the abuses.

24:04.460 --> 24:06.951
Someone's got to fight,
and fight hard,

24:07.029 --> 24:09.930
for anyone or anything
that can't fight back.

24:17.239 --> 24:19.537
"lf I can ease one life
the aching

24:19.608 --> 24:21.269
"Or cool one pain

24:22.011 --> 24:23.842
"Or help one fainting robin

24:23.912 --> 24:25.743
"Unto his nest again

24:26.515 --> 24:28.608
"l shall not live in vain"

24:32.721 --> 24:35.747
Yes, Miss Dickinson
would probably approve.

24:37.526 --> 24:38.618
Thank you.

24:39.428 --> 24:42.295
If we could adjourn this
mutual admiration society,

24:42.364 --> 24:45.356
I would like to get back
to the business at hand, Kele.

24:45.701 --> 24:47.100
How much is the ransom?

24:47.169 --> 24:48.830
Ask them,
they ate that part.

24:48.904 --> 24:52.271
All I can make out is
"Pohaku Point at 2:00 p.m."

24:52.341 --> 24:54.866
I'm gonna go see these guys and tell
them what happened to their demands.

24:54.943 --> 24:55.967
I'm going with you.

24:56.045 --> 24:57.239
No. No way.

24:57.312 --> 24:59.280
But I know them.
I can talk to them, Thomas.

24:59.348 --> 25:01.179
Goldie, these guys
aren't exactly candidates

25:01.250 --> 25:02.945
for the Albert Schweitzer
Award.

25:03.018 --> 25:05.578
I mean, they've threatened to
kill Kele if we call the cops.

25:05.654 --> 25:08.179
I mean, you can't talk
to guys like that!

25:08.257 --> 25:10.282
What about President Kole?

25:10.359 --> 25:11.724
Higgins is going
to talk to him, isn't he?

25:11.794 --> 25:13.056
That's different.
Why?

25:13.128 --> 25:14.117
Because...

25:14.196 --> 25:15.857
She's right, Magnum.
Sometimes the power of the word

25:15.931 --> 25:17.626
can be overwhelming.

25:17.699 --> 25:20.361
I believe Emily Dickinson
said it best.

25:20.436 --> 25:22.063
"We never know how high we are

25:22.137 --> 25:24.367
"Till we are called to rise

25:24.440 --> 25:27.671
"And then,
if we are true to plan..."

25:29.344 --> 25:31.676
"Our statures
touch the skies"

25:41.924 --> 25:44.688
I never believed in
giving human emotions to animals.

25:44.760 --> 25:47.354
It's unscientific,
overly sentimental.

25:48.263 --> 25:50.288
And it takes all the fun
out of a chili burger.

25:50.365 --> 25:52.265
But listening to Goldie,

25:52.334 --> 25:55.701
I began to understand just how
deep her convictions really were.

25:56.105 --> 25:58.539
And I also began to see that
she was the type of person

25:58.607 --> 26:00.700
who had to express
her feelings

26:00.776 --> 26:02.141
as loudly as she could,

26:02.211 --> 26:04.736
expend all of her emotions
freely.

26:05.814 --> 26:09.511
I'd always been more the type to
put something away for a rainy day.

26:09.585 --> 26:11.553
Emotions, as well as
everything else.

26:11.620 --> 26:13.247
And since my little voice
was telling me

26:13.322 --> 26:17.315
that this rendezvous had been set
up for reasons other than ransom,

26:17.392 --> 26:20.759
I was glad I had put away
something rather substantial.

26:23.198 --> 26:24.290
Is that Smith or Jones?

26:24.366 --> 26:25.458
Smith.

26:25.534 --> 26:26.899
Please, Thomas,
let me do the talking.

26:26.969 --> 26:29.335
I know this is some kind
of cosmic misunderstanding.

26:29.404 --> 26:30.871
His or yours?

26:31.173 --> 26:32.538
Mr. Smith!

26:35.110 --> 26:36.941
Where's your partner?

26:37.112 --> 26:38.340
Did you bring
the money?

26:38.413 --> 26:42.179
Now, John, I thought we'd all
agreed to not let Kele go.

26:42.251 --> 26:44.651
You know he won't survive
out there. MAGNUM: Goldie...

26:44.720 --> 26:46.915
And did you know that
lpo has stopped eating?

26:46.989 --> 26:48.980
She's gonna die
if we don't bring Kele back!

26:49.057 --> 26:50.991
Goldie, will you
calm down, please?

26:51.059 --> 26:52.321
Please.

26:52.528 --> 26:54.086
Now, look,

26:54.163 --> 26:56.427
if you just tell us where
you've got Kele stashed,

26:56.498 --> 26:57.965
we'll just chalk
this whole thing up

26:58.033 --> 27:00.627
to your obvious,
innate humanitarianism.

27:00.903 --> 27:02.564
Who else knows about this?

27:02.638 --> 27:04.572
Nobody. Really!
Goldie, will...

27:04.640 --> 27:06.267
You can trust us.

27:07.242 --> 27:09.039
If you'll just tell us
where Kele is,

27:09.111 --> 27:10.976
nobody else will ever have
Goldie...

27:11.046 --> 27:13.480
...as long as you admit it
and do the right thing!

28:15.110 --> 28:16.737
You okay?

28:23.751 --> 28:24.979
Ta-da!

28:25.052 --> 28:26.485
Thanks, T.C.

28:26.554 --> 28:28.886
I don't understand
how T.C. could've lost the van.

28:28.956 --> 28:31.186
Well, there was some
minor damage to the chopper.

28:31.258 --> 28:33.385
Minor? The guy took out
my fuel line.

28:33.461 --> 28:36.589
And just to be on the safe side,
T.C. had to set it down.

28:37.164 --> 28:38.392
I could've been killed.

28:38.466 --> 28:40.093
Well, we did get
a license number, though.

28:40.167 --> 28:42.499
JRP-4,
something, something.

28:43.604 --> 28:46.266
JRP-4, something, something.
That's all you got?

28:46.340 --> 28:49.104
Well, I mean, you see,
the van was pulling away

28:49.176 --> 28:52.612
and there was some kind of mark on
the back, near the license plate.

28:52.680 --> 28:54.045
Was it gold?

28:54.348 --> 28:55.576
Black and gold.

28:56.584 --> 28:59.553
I thought you told me that
the van was white, not black.

28:59.620 --> 29:01.815
Rick, I'm not talking to you.

29:02.022 --> 29:03.580
Yeah, it was...

29:04.525 --> 29:05.992
Yeah. No, more oval.

29:06.060 --> 29:08.051
Oval, and it had
wavy lines on it,

29:08.128 --> 29:12.224
and over here it had something
like a sun, maybe, and initials.

29:12.299 --> 29:14.631
Thomas, is this
some kind of code?

29:15.469 --> 29:16.993
The mark of Radcliff.

29:17.071 --> 29:18.299
The mark of who?

29:18.372 --> 29:20.863
Zorro!
Now do I win a prize, Thomas?

29:21.509 --> 29:23.101
Rodney Radcliff.

29:23.711 --> 29:26.271
He designed the logo
for the lsland Hopper,

29:26.347 --> 29:29.339
he also did the custom job
on my van and chopper.

29:29.416 --> 29:32.078
He has a little shop
at the end of Nahele Road

29:32.152 --> 29:33.517
on the North Shore.
- Thomas?

29:34.722 --> 29:36.087
Hey, Thomas!
Great.

29:39.059 --> 29:40.458
Don't mention it.

29:41.729 --> 29:42.718
Hey, let's go.

29:42.796 --> 29:44.058
Okay. One minute.

29:44.331 --> 29:46.322
T.C.?
Huh?

29:46.400 --> 29:47.424
Thanks for the shirt.

29:47.501 --> 29:48.661
Sure.

29:48.736 --> 29:50.829
And thanks for saving
my life back there.

29:50.905 --> 29:53.100
Oh, well,
that makes us even.

29:53.340 --> 29:54.568
What do you mean?

29:54.642 --> 29:57.611
Oh, well, if you hadn't dragged
Thomas through that English class,

29:57.678 --> 29:59.236
he wouldn't have
gotten into Annapolis,

29:59.313 --> 30:00.439
wouldn't have been
in the Navy,

30:00.514 --> 30:01.640
wouldn't have been
in Vietnam.

30:01.715 --> 30:02.773
And if he hadn't been
in Vietnam,

30:02.850 --> 30:05.512
I probably wouldn't be alive to
give you the shirt off my back.

30:07.354 --> 30:09.151
Thanks, T.C. That's very nice.

30:09.957 --> 30:12.016
Well, of course,
on the other hand,

30:12.092 --> 30:15.323
I wouldn't be replacing
chopper parts every other week.

30:15.396 --> 30:17.227
Speaking of which,
we're gonna have to stop

30:17.298 --> 30:19.823
and get an estimate on this
fuel line on the way out.

30:19.900 --> 30:21.959
And I'm sure you'll want
to take a look at it.

30:22.036 --> 30:23.503
I'll meet you at Rodney's.

30:23.571 --> 30:24.697
Wait! You don't even
know where he...

30:24.772 --> 30:26.763
Yeah,
down at Kale Road. We got it.

30:26.840 --> 30:30.241
No... Whatever you do,
don't try to talk to him without me.

30:30.311 --> 30:32.176
Right!

30:48.429 --> 30:49.794
Oh, Thomas.

30:50.397 --> 30:51.591
What?

30:51.966 --> 30:53.194
Vietnam.

30:53.834 --> 30:55.267
The whole time
you were over there fighting,

30:55.336 --> 30:57.702
I was marching
and demonstrating.

30:58.472 --> 30:59.700
I know.

30:59.773 --> 31:03.038
It's not that I regret
protesting the war. I don't.

31:03.110 --> 31:05.977
It's just that I never
stopped to think about you.

31:07.081 --> 31:08.605
I'm so sorry.

31:09.850 --> 31:12.182
We both did what
we thought was right.

31:12.252 --> 31:15.346
Thomas... No,
don't start apologizing again.

31:15.422 --> 31:17.583
I'm just sorry for involving
you in this whole mess.

31:17.658 --> 31:20.183
Listen to me.
I took this case of my own free will.

31:20.260 --> 31:21.352
I could have said no.

31:21.428 --> 31:23.293
Maybe you should have.

31:23.597 --> 31:24.928
Well, maybe you should have.

31:24.999 --> 31:27.399
I mean, this Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones,
whoever they may be,

31:27.468 --> 31:29.766
certainly aren't interested
in any cause.

31:29.837 --> 31:32.397
If it weren't for me
and my good intentions,

31:32.473 --> 31:35.636
Kele would be in his tank
right now with lpo, safe.

31:35.976 --> 31:37.375
It's all my fault.

31:37.444 --> 31:41.175
No! No, Goldie.
Everything doesn't get to be your fault.

31:41.248 --> 31:42.272
I'm sorry.

31:42.349 --> 31:45.978
You can't be in charge of the
entire world and everything in it.

31:46.587 --> 31:49.988
I can't just look away.
I have to help, or at least try to.

31:50.391 --> 31:52.655
Thomas, I don't want to
have lived my life in vain.

31:52.726 --> 31:56.321
No! No! Not Emily Dickinson
again, please!

31:56.397 --> 31:57.591
What's wrong with that?

31:57.665 --> 32:01.362
You're running your whole life on words
written by a woman who was a total recluse.

32:01.435 --> 32:02.868
She never left the house.

32:02.936 --> 32:06.064
All she did all day was
make sure her meter rhymed!

32:06.440 --> 32:07.532
How can you say that?

32:07.608 --> 32:09.667
Well, sure, she wrote
some great poems.

32:09.743 --> 32:11.335
But she never had to live
in the real world,

32:11.412 --> 32:13.607
so she never had
to make any mistakes.

32:13.681 --> 32:14.909
Oh!

32:19.019 --> 32:21.317
Now, if you can't live
with the mistakes, Goldie,

32:21.388 --> 32:24.084
then you should lock yourself
up in a room and write poetry.

32:24.158 --> 32:27.559
It'd be a lot easier and safer.
For both of us.

32:30.097 --> 32:31.189
Back when we were kids,

32:31.265 --> 32:33.756
Iife seemed to be a whole
lot simpler, Thomas.

32:33.834 --> 32:36.428
Life has never been simple
for you, Goldie.

32:39.006 --> 32:40.769
You won't let it be.

32:44.545 --> 32:46.445
Let's go talk to this guy.

32:47.114 --> 32:50.550
Thomas! Thomas, T.C. said not
to talk to him without him.

32:50.617 --> 32:53.780
Please, I know what I'm doing.
This is my job.

32:53.854 --> 32:57.688
Mr. Radcliff,
I saw a logo on a van.

32:58.092 --> 33:00.083
It's a signature, not a logo.
Now scram.

33:00.160 --> 33:01.718
Yeah, but Mr. Radcliff...

33:01.795 --> 33:04.025
I said get out of here!
I mean it.

33:04.098 --> 33:07.329
Come on, Rodney Radcliff.
He didn't mean to offend you.

33:07.401 --> 33:09.631
T.C.? Is that you?

33:09.703 --> 33:10.965
Yeah, it's me.

33:11.038 --> 33:14.098
I told you not
to talk to him without me.

33:18.545 --> 33:21.480
Logos are used on toilet
doors in the airport.

33:22.449 --> 33:26.010
Signatures only appear
on genuine pieces of art.

33:26.086 --> 33:28.680
Well, I'm sorry.
Really sorry.

33:29.089 --> 33:32.718
Not bad. This is a surrealist
vision of the wheel.

33:34.027 --> 33:36.757
We live in an age
of culture on wheels.

33:37.698 --> 33:42.328
You know, I figure,
Michaelangelo and Salvador Dali

33:42.402 --> 33:44.302
got to sign their work.

33:44.571 --> 33:48.735
Now who's gonna say my custom
jobs can't be called art?

33:48.809 --> 33:50.071
Not me.

33:50.744 --> 33:51.904
Logos.

33:52.780 --> 33:55.374
Now, Rodney Radcliff used to do
a lot of high-tech installation

33:55.449 --> 33:57.212
for the Marine Corps.

33:58.085 --> 34:00.451
Now I'm completely
into aesthetics.

34:00.754 --> 34:05.123
Custom body jobs,
truck murals, van art.

34:06.059 --> 34:08.652
See, a man's vehicle
is his castle.

34:09.029 --> 34:12.658
I figure what you drive
can say a lot about a person.

34:13.033 --> 34:15.524
Like that filthy,
dirty Ferrari over there.

34:15.601 --> 34:18.469
Now, can you imagine
the kind of person

34:18.539 --> 34:21.303
that would abuse
such a beautiful machine?

34:22.943 --> 34:26.036
You worked on every van
with this logo... Signature?

34:26.112 --> 34:28.775
I mean, you didn't have
any mechanics or assistants?

34:28.849 --> 34:30.578
Did Picasso have an assistant?

34:31.385 --> 34:32.476
I work alone.

34:32.553 --> 34:34.953
Yeah, I'm sorry, but see,
this van was solid white.

34:35.022 --> 34:36.853
It had no artwork at all.

34:36.924 --> 34:40.860
Well, I tried to talk them into a
nice mural of a sunset on the side.

34:40.928 --> 34:44.295
Oh! Oh, hey, then you do remember
working on this particular van?

34:44.364 --> 34:46.797
Well, it was a major
structural redo.

34:46.867 --> 34:48.094
Anybody else,
it'd take a week.

34:48.168 --> 34:50.898
Me, I did it all in 48 hours.

34:51.170 --> 34:54.971
Worked day and night.
No sleep, no drugs.

34:55.576 --> 34:59.171
You see, creativity
stimulates my adrenal glands

34:59.246 --> 35:02.044
and gives me a natural rush,
you understand?

35:02.115 --> 35:04.049
Totally. The van?

35:04.484 --> 35:07.715
Yeah, well, I had to reinforce
the entire undercarriage.

35:07.788 --> 35:09.983
I mean,
we're talking about

35:10.057 --> 35:13.026
maybe tripling
the stress capabilities

35:13.093 --> 35:15.584
of all the joints
under the chassis

35:15.662 --> 35:18.358
in order to hold that much water.
But then...

35:18.432 --> 35:22.892
Then I painted this great seascape
on the ceiling, at no cost.

35:22.970 --> 35:25.666
I'm saying these guys weren't
exactly patrons of the arts,

35:25.739 --> 35:28.606
but I needed to satisfy
that creative urge.

35:29.243 --> 35:30.267
Rodney?
Yeah.

35:30.344 --> 35:33.313
Did you ask them why they wanted to
turn their van into a swimming pool?

35:33.380 --> 35:36.042
Well, they said, like, it was gonna
be the ultimate isolation tank.

35:36.116 --> 35:37.743
You know, float and go Zen.

35:37.818 --> 35:38.876
And let me tell you something.

35:38.952 --> 35:41.648
These two dudes could have used
all the Zen they could get.

35:41.722 --> 35:43.280
I mean, they were
very high-strung.

35:43.357 --> 35:45.382
Could you give us
their names?

35:46.293 --> 35:47.954
Well,
I have a work order here...

35:49.363 --> 35:50.387
Somewhere.

35:51.498 --> 35:55.491
Ah, yeah. Here it is.
Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones.

35:55.636 --> 35:57.433
Oh, come on,
Rodney Radcliff,

35:57.504 --> 35:59.028
do you believe those are
their real names?

35:59.106 --> 36:00.198
They paid cash.

36:00.274 --> 36:01.673
There's no license number.

36:01.742 --> 36:02.902
Well, like I said,
they paid cash.

36:02.976 --> 36:04.341
Lives are at stake here!

36:04.411 --> 36:05.435
Yours?
No.

36:05.512 --> 36:06.604
T.C.?

36:07.214 --> 36:09.182
Well, there's too many people
on this rock anyway.

36:09.249 --> 36:11.444
It's not a person.
It's a dolphin.

36:11.852 --> 36:12.978
A dolphin?

36:13.053 --> 36:15.920
His name is Kele.
And his mate lpo also will die.

36:16.556 --> 36:19.923
You know, I once knew a pretty little
girl who lived over on the big island.

36:19.993 --> 36:21.790
Her folks named her Matilda.

36:21.862 --> 36:24.296
Can you imagine snuggling up
to a girl in the moonlight

36:24.364 --> 36:26.457
and whispering,
"l love you, Matilda"?

36:26.533 --> 36:28.763
So I started calling her lpo.

36:29.803 --> 36:32.533
My little sweetheart.
She likes that.

36:37.411 --> 36:38.639
Damn it!

36:39.246 --> 36:40.975
Rodney Radcliff,
are you all right?

36:41.348 --> 36:42.815
Yeah, I'm just fine.

36:42.883 --> 36:46.649
I was remembering how much
I really care for dolphins.

36:48.722 --> 36:51.350
Now, why didn't you
tell me this right off?

36:51.425 --> 36:54.519
Back when you were living on K-rations,
I was working demolition jobs.

36:54.594 --> 36:56.391
All different kinds
of devices.

36:56.463 --> 36:58.226
Well, these guys
had this rig...

36:58.298 --> 37:00.289
A sort of rig hanging
in the back of their van.

37:00.367 --> 37:03.768
You know, like, a backpack sort
of thing and when I think of it...

37:03.837 --> 37:05.464
Could it have been
some sort of a bomb?

37:05.539 --> 37:08.167
No! Not a bomb,
a bomb-carrying device.

37:08.508 --> 37:12.706
You know, adjustable straps
just about dolphin size.

37:13.814 --> 37:16.282
Was there enough
to take out a military ship?

37:16.350 --> 37:18.978
No, the pack wasn't big enough
to carry that much of explosive

37:19.052 --> 37:21.384
to take out
any government issue.

37:21.888 --> 37:22.946
Can I use your phone?

37:23.023 --> 37:25.651
Yeah, there's one
up there by the desk.

37:28.962 --> 37:29.951
What you doing?

37:30.030 --> 37:31.224
I'm calling the coast guard.

37:31.298 --> 37:32.390
But Rodney Radcliff said

37:32.466 --> 37:34.457
they didn't have enough muscle
to take down a ship that big.

37:34.534 --> 37:36.434
I'm thinking something
smaller like a yacht.

37:36.503 --> 37:39.700
Like maybe that yacht
anchored outside Alihi Harbor.

37:39.773 --> 37:41.468
The one where they're having
the human rights meeting.

37:41.541 --> 37:43.475
Yeah.
President Kole!

37:43.543 --> 37:44.771
Higgins.

37:55.838 --> 37:58.602
I can just see
the headlines now.

37:58.674 --> 38:00.141
"Assassin drives up
to dock in car

38:00.209 --> 38:02.404
"of best-selling author
Robin Masters."

38:02.478 --> 38:06.107
Come on, T.C. Goldie's no killer.
She's an idealist.

38:06.549 --> 38:08.483
Who do you think they recruit
for these kinds of jobs?

38:08.551 --> 38:10.610
Yeah, she is a little naive.

38:10.686 --> 38:11.983
Yeah, a little?

38:12.054 --> 38:14.579
I mean, that chick got used,
she got set up.

38:14.657 --> 38:17.592
All she ever wanted to do
was free a dolphin.

38:18.127 --> 38:21.187
Good intentions.
You know where that road goes.

38:29.405 --> 38:30.599
Hey!

38:31.807 --> 38:32.899
Magnum.

38:36.545 --> 38:38.706
I called the coast guard
right after I talked to you.

38:38.781 --> 38:41.113
I can't believe they would
use Kele to blow up a ship.

38:41.183 --> 38:44.050
Magnum, are people really
capable of doing such things?

38:44.119 --> 38:45.586
Are dolphins?

38:46.889 --> 38:48.720
Yes, a dolphin.

38:48.791 --> 38:51.259
With a bomb
strapped to his back.

38:51.327 --> 38:52.692
Search her.

38:54.496 --> 38:57.727
Please,
you've got to believe me!

39:00.169 --> 39:02.364
Let go! Please!

39:07.943 --> 39:10.741
Presenting His
Excellency President Kole.

39:18.187 --> 39:22.021
Ladies and gentlemen,
on behalf of the people of West Senanga,

39:22.291 --> 39:25.021
I welcome you
to the soil of my country.

39:25.828 --> 39:29.389
I know you have heard that
West Senanga is a hard land,

39:29.732 --> 39:34.032
but it is a country where the
process of development has begun.

39:34.136 --> 39:35.694
And it continues.

39:36.805 --> 39:40.832
Hunger is simply an unfortunate
fact of life for my countrymen.

39:41.644 --> 39:45.239
Perhaps, it is only a fact of
life for some of his countrymen.

39:53.255 --> 39:54.517
See anything?

39:54.590 --> 39:55.750
No!

40:07.169 --> 40:09.228
Don't you understand
what's going on?

40:09.305 --> 40:11.830
President Kole's life
is in danger.

40:11.907 --> 40:14.205
Oh, let go! Please!

40:17.112 --> 40:18.977
I got something on radar.

40:19.048 --> 40:21.380
It's about 100 yards
off our bow.

40:24.987 --> 40:26.511
That's him.

40:26.588 --> 40:28.453
Can you see
the bomb harness?

40:28.524 --> 40:29.889
Yeah!

40:30.326 --> 40:32.294
I'll grab the
coast guard chopper.

40:32.561 --> 40:34.392
Tell him to radio
the yacht.

40:34.463 --> 40:35.953
Pull up anchor.
Head out to sea.

40:36.031 --> 40:39.228
I've trained Kele to find and
seek visual images on command.

40:39.301 --> 40:40.928
He was an exceptional student.

40:41.003 --> 40:42.561
If there's a target
on that yacht,

40:42.638 --> 40:43.866
they can sail
all the way to Maui.

40:43.939 --> 40:46.203
It won't do any good.
They'll never outrun him.

40:50.813 --> 40:54.806
I think it is a mistake to say that I
do not hear all the words of my people.

40:54.883 --> 40:58.182
Kole, you have brutally silenced
the words of your people.

40:58.253 --> 41:00.380
You've silenced them
with hunger and fear.

41:00.456 --> 41:02.083
That is a lie!

41:02.157 --> 41:04.921
I hear the cries of the poor and
the sound of the smallest child.

41:04.993 --> 41:07.052
And the sound
of the rioters.

41:07.596 --> 41:10.622
President Kole,
you're in terrible danger!

41:10.699 --> 41:12.894
There seems to be
some kind of a disturbance.

41:12.968 --> 41:16.062
President Kole,
please listen.

41:16.138 --> 41:17.662
I hear nothing.

41:18.207 --> 41:21.973
Then it's no wonder your people are
hungry. Their president is deaf.

41:22.044 --> 41:24.808
You're all
in terrible danger!

41:24.880 --> 41:27.815
Please! I'm not playing games.

41:29.084 --> 41:30.449
All of you!

41:31.253 --> 41:32.311
Goldie.

41:32.388 --> 41:34.151
She is merely
a dissident.

41:34.223 --> 41:37.090
A protestor trying
to disrupt this meeting.

41:37.159 --> 41:40.128
I demand your security guards
unhand that girl.

41:40.195 --> 41:43.824
Remember, you're only an unofficial
representative and my guest.

41:43.899 --> 41:45.594
You're entirely correct,
President Kole.

41:45.667 --> 41:48.602
Protocol forbids me from asking
anything in the name of England.

41:48.670 --> 41:51.070
So I am telling you,
let her go!

41:56.211 --> 41:59.942
Thomas,
we gotta do something fast.

42:02.885 --> 42:04.512
There's nothing
you can do?

42:05.454 --> 42:09.788
Kele's capable of responding to verbal
commands as well as visual stimuli.

42:10.893 --> 42:12.690
Can you turn him around?

42:12.761 --> 42:16.162
Ipo can. This is her voice.
Slow the boat!

42:30.179 --> 42:31.840
Makini, can this work?

42:31.914 --> 42:33.711
It has in my experiments.

42:39.588 --> 42:42.056
Thomas, I don't think
you got any choice.

42:50.933 --> 42:52.594
Just give me
30 more seconds.

42:52.668 --> 42:54.602
Makini, I can give you 10.

43:03.412 --> 43:05.676
Thomas, you've got to do it.

43:07.516 --> 43:09.416
Makini, is he turning?

43:11.386 --> 43:12.853
Do what you must.

43:27.870 --> 43:29.804
Wait, wait!
He's turning back!

43:29.872 --> 43:31.203
He's turning back
from the yacht!

43:31.273 --> 43:32.900
He's coming towards us.

43:32.975 --> 43:35.273
Hey, we gotta
get that bomb off of him.

43:38.013 --> 43:39.571
Can you keep him
coming this way?

43:39.648 --> 43:42.276
Ipo will.
You need the scuba gear?

43:42.351 --> 43:44.012
No, there's no time.

45:35.597 --> 45:39.556
lpo and Kele,
reunited at last.

45:40.268 --> 45:43.169
Oh, Thomas, I wish
you could have seen

45:43.238 --> 45:45.502
the great
military hero Kole

45:45.574 --> 45:47.633
ducking behind Seko Rwanda.

45:47.709 --> 45:51.236
I did see it.
On the front page of the morning paper.

45:52.414 --> 45:54.905
"lf I can ease one life
the aching

45:54.983 --> 45:56.450
"Or cool one pain..."

45:58.754 --> 46:00.153
Goldie, I have
a strong suspicion

46:00.222 --> 46:03.316
you shall never again need
fear having lived in vain.

46:06.962 --> 46:09.556
Aloha, Higgins.
Kiss the lads for me.

46:11.900 --> 46:12.889
Aloha, Goldie.

46:12.968 --> 46:13.992
Aloha, Makini.

46:23.045 --> 46:24.672
You know, I was going to
take you to the airport.

46:24.746 --> 46:27.271
Oh, no, no, no.
I won't put you to any trouble.

46:28.583 --> 46:30.278
I guess
it's a little late for that.

46:31.420 --> 46:34.116
Maybe you'll come back
sometime between causes.

46:43.298 --> 46:44.765
Goldie, wait.

47:01.950 --> 47:03.281
Go get 'em.

47:08.023 --> 47:09.217
Somebody once said,

47:09.291 --> 47:12.158
"It's hard to know what kind
of person you've become,

47:12.227 --> 47:14.889
"tough to find the standard
to measure yourself by."

47:14.963 --> 47:16.260
But I think he was wrong.

47:16.331 --> 47:18.595
Looking at Goldie, I realized

47:18.667 --> 47:21.830
the best mirror you'll ever
have is the face of a friend.
