Greetings.

03:08.567 --> 03:12.242

He was conscious.

03:14.100 --> 03:17.445
We and this hermitage will
have gratitude towards doctor.

03:17.600 --> 03:21.673
You cleared three years coma
and returned our tutor to us.

03:22.033 --> 03:24.707
Yesterday night itself we tried to
contact doctor over the phone.

03:25.100 --> 03:26.135
Didn't get you.

03:26.267 --> 03:28.747
I was outside over there,
there is no range for the mobile.

03:30.800 --> 03:35.078
Worth of crores
these Tibetan paintings.

03:35.233 --> 03:39.409
At the earliest it should be
brought back to our hermitage.

03:40.333 --> 03:46.147
Only then we can regain
our lost glory.

03:48.500 --> 03:51.743
When consciousness was regained
he was talking only about that painting.

03:55.533 --> 03:58.241
Tutor he is the doctor
who treated you.

04:03.600 --> 04:05.375
Thank you.

04:06.167 --> 04:09.239
There is an un-ending
gratitude towards doctor.

04:09.600 --> 04:12.080
If the memory was
not regained back.

04:12.267 --> 04:18.707
That too as this painting was send
to Benjapuri no one will know that.

04:19.233 --> 04:24.410

arrangements to return that back here.

04:34.933 --> 04:43.751
MBRHDRG

04:52.767 --> 04:56.544
Your aim was to grab
this painting, no?

04:56.700 --> 05:01.171
For this only did you delegate me
to bring that Lama from coma.

05:01.367 --> 05:04.075
Other day the guru was
also killed for this isn't it?

05:04.233 --> 05:08.238
Yes for this only. At that time
killing guru was my necessity.

05:08.367 --> 05:12.076
I had delegated you for this painting.
To awake this Lama from coma.

05:12.767 --> 05:16.715
There you went wrong. This painting
is not there not only in this monastery.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.775
Not even in this state.

05:19.100 --> 05:23.742
Then where is it? -Wait I'll tell now
in this business I'm also a partner.

05:24.067 --> 05:26.274
What is the benefit for
me you tell that first?

05:30.433 --> 05:34.745
Look I'll tell one thing its better
that we go in mutual agreement.

05:35.667 --> 05:39.240
I'll do what you want.
But tell where that painting is.

05:39.433 --> 05:42.107
In Karnataka at Benjapuri
there are nine monasteries.

05:42.267 --> 05:44.247
One among that this
painting is there.

09:41.067 --> 09:44.446
This is that painting. Five Tibetans.

09:49.367 --> 09:54.578
This is only an advance. On finding

09:57.400 --> 09:59.471
No sir that is.

09:59.600 --> 10:03.742

10:12.267 --> 10:14.577
Peter.
Okay then everything as said.

10:49.667 --> 10:51.578
This is lemon pickle.

10:53.267 --> 10:55.042
This is tender mango.

10:55.433 --> 10:57.242
This prawns fried and smashed.

10:57.433 --> 11:00.744
This is onion.
My situation is right to eat all this.

11:01.233 --> 11:07.047
What is it? -My mother can't all this
be obtained in the shops at Bangalore?

11:07.333 --> 11:09.404
Anyway this won't be
obtained in shops.

11:09.533 --> 11:12.514
In this there is my
prayers and love in this.

11:12.700 --> 11:16.477
My goodness did you put those two in this.
The taste of the pickle will be gone.

11:21.533 --> 11:25.743
Son Joe one minute.

11:32.400 --> 11:36.542
This is an offering deity when your
stabilizer company failed, mom had offered.

11:39.100 --> 11:44.106
On the first day of the job, dedicate
this to a good church at Bangalore.

11:46.167 --> 11:51.412
Son, this I've prayed when your
electrical shop was shut down.

11:51.600 --> 11:54.080
And this. Must have prayed when
travel agency was shut down.

11:54.300 --> 11:57.281
That was St. Sebastian's image.

Mother don't scold. Yes.

12:40.133 --> 12:43.046
When mother's son goes for a
good thing and if we are scolded.

12:43.167 --> 12:45.044
Then the badness'
is for mothefs son.

12:45.167 --> 12:47.238

Mother for today don't scold them.

13:01.067 --> 13:01.772

By convincing the family that we

Fearing that Nam biars.

14:59.800 --> 15:02.144

word will never come to the tongue.

15:12.733 --> 15:15.145

While driving talking

19:45.800 --> 19:49.179

What's your father doing?

20:28.467 --> 20:29.969
On top of this.

20:30.433 --> 20:33.073
Goodness father has expired sir.

20:33.700 --> 20:37.409

20:37.500 --> 20:39.741

But there is a caparison.
Are you taking the bribe? - No sir.

20:43.767 --> 20:46.771
One minute, sir you may see this.

20:48.667 --> 20:50.544

20:51.100 --> 20:53.444
The boon received for

20:54.733 --> 20:58.681
This is previous Indian president.
This is my father.

20:59.433 --> 21:02.380
During that time when the Indian
president came for Kerala visit.

21:02.600 --> 21:05.274
Traveled in father's car. During
that time it was a big news.

21:05.700 --> 21:06.735
I've heard that one.

Just imagine like that.

21:43.433 --> 21:47.438

22:17.067 --> 22:24.610
MC Movie Channel

22:25.433 --> 22:27.640
Mr. Joe Joseph Thiruthanathil.

22:29.500 --> 22:31.480
Mr. K.T. Salman.

22:33.633 --> 22:38.104
Mr. Umesh Pisharadi.
I was your teacher.

22:38.500 --> 22:42.312
But we were not like teacher
and student relationship. No?

22:42.700 --> 22:47.376
A decayed travel agency.
A disgusting barber shop.

22:47.500 --> 22:50.709
A stinking provision shop.

22:51.067 --> 22:54.640
Your life was not to end
by doing these businesses.

22:55.400 --> 22:59.610
I made you to do each and every
business not for my growth.

23:04.567 --> 23:08.344
While not thinking big we were
able to eat rice gruel in a small way.

23:08.500 --> 23:10.241
Your Kunjamma's rice gruel!

23:10.433 --> 23:13.539
Earlier on saying such an English

23:14.400 --> 23:18.177
Look at that smile!
Don't waste time by saying old things.

23:18.500 --> 23:22.312
To return 75 Iakhs to Nambiars
what is the project seen by tutor?

23:22.500 --> 23:23.535
Will say, will say.

23:23.667 --> 23:29.174
On a specific place where the
printed paper pieces with value.

23:29.300 --> 23:33.578
With physical effort by
conducting a change in positions.

23:33.733 --> 23:35.735
We are using for our goal.

23:36.600 --> 23:38.375
Again gone mad?

23:38.767 --> 23:44.274
The printed papers with a value.
Change in positions.

23:46.100 --> 23:47.738
Theft!

23:48.567 --> 23:52.014
He is telling to steal
someone else's money.

23:53.200 --> 23:57.080
A theft.
Not a theft, a bank robbery.

23:57.200 --> 24:00.579
Beat and kill him man.
Don't beat, don't beat.

24:01.333 --> 24:06.078
Move back. Leave. While saying there
is no big age difference between us.

24:06.233 --> 24:08.713
Although he has taught us on a
parallel college, a tutor is a tutor.

24:09.067 --> 24:12.105
Because of that. - But still.
Settle down.

24:13.133 --> 24:17.138
Dear sir, the agreement of my
house has become rusted like this.

24:17.400 --> 24:19.243
Yet another thinking big of sir.

24:19.433 --> 24:21.674
Although we have lost lot of
money and in debts to the neck.

24:22.033 --> 24:24.741
Never we've done anything
against the law so far.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.503
Can do now is it?
To rob a bank and all.

24:27.733 --> 24:31.340
See students this is not a bank
robbery. Don't beat, don't beat.

24:31.467 --> 24:35.745
Beat and break the head man.
Let me finish and after that you scream.

24:36.767 --> 24:38.508
This is not a big bank and all.

24:38.633 --> 24:41.614
The finance institution of
Nambiars, hard core financiers...

24:41.800 --> 24:43.541
...where you owe
money. That is being robbed.

24:44.633 --> 24:49.082
Hey man.
As its a small finance company.

24:49.267 --> 24:52.771
There are only four or five staffs
there is no security at all.

24:53.100 --> 24:57.446
An ordinary building. As lot of
black money people invests cash.

24:57.567 --> 25:00.377
There is no chance that this
Nambiars will give case against you.

25:00.734 --> 25:05.581
By looting a fraud institution
we are also doing social service.

25:05.767 --> 25:08.008
Not only that the looted money...

25:08.100 --> 25:10.478
...is returned back in the
next day to Nam biars.

25:10.633 --> 25:12.772
In principal there is
no theft taking place.

25:13.067 --> 25:15.240
By the by fellow!
What, fellow? - Not that tutor.

25:15.433 --> 25:19.973
In the real sense we are not stealing
but our debt is cleared, isn't it?

25:20.433 --> 25:24.040
Buddy we simply
misunderstood tutor okay.

25:24.233 --> 25:26.235
Even if we are jailed
we won't come out...

25:26.400 --> 25:28.073
...such an idea that is
what this stupid is saying.

25:28.433 --> 25:32.142
Hey man if Nambiars
catch hold of our property.

25:32.300 --> 25:37.409
Its better to be jailed than simply
roaming throughout the life.

25:37.634 --> 25:41.411
Man, whatever you
say I'm not there.

25:41.567 --> 25:42.477
You won't come up.

25:43.533 --> 25:49.245
Tutor come here to loot this bank
modern equipments are needed, no?

25:49.633 --> 25:52.637
Nothing is required only
one thing is required.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.708
What's that?
A mind without fear.

25:56.300 --> 26:00.407
Where to go to get that?
Will he be having that?

26:11.567 --> 26:13.604
Nam bi chetta!

26:23.467 --> 26:25.708
Why are you screaming?
Nam bi brother.

26:26.133 --> 26:28.204
Kubera is coming.
Is it so?

26:28.534 --> 26:31.105
Perhaps coming to
deposit money. Where is he?

26:31.267 --> 26:34.407
When the crow cried didn't I say
visitors are coming to deposit?

26:34.667 --> 26:36.647
I told about the Kubera law.

26:40.134 --> 26:42.045
All the money lenders are nabbed.

26:42.200 --> 26:45.204
Brother should be careful
any moment we'll be caught.

26:50.500 --> 26:52.980
My god chetta!(Husband)
Nam bi chetta!

26:53.267 --> 26:56.407
Must be heart attack. Can
go to city hospital fast.

26:56.633 --> 27:00.274
Don't go there they are
more cunning than us.

27:00.534 --> 27:03.413
This can be beared
can't bear their bill.

27:03.600 --> 27:07.446
You go and take Amirthanjan.
We can call doctor here.

27:07.733 --> 27:09.713
There is nothing with me man.

27:10.033 --> 27:13.071
Reached so far,
achieved this much.

27:13.233 --> 27:17.375
In between that his
grandfather's Kubera.

27:18.600 --> 27:24.107
You inform all the branches to
collect the money that is given out.

27:24.233 --> 27:25.211
Call.

27:27.100 --> 27:29.546
That Joy and team to pay the money
the last date is tomorrow, is it?

27:29.767 --> 27:32.270
Yes, if not given should
catch them also.

27:32.600 --> 27:39.176
Badra, Jabbar, tomorrow all must be
here after having food don't sleep.

27:39.334 --> 27:42.440
No. - Sometimes that Joe and gang
shoulbe be brought to the godown.

27:42.600 --> 27:44.170
Okay boss.

27:44.433 --> 27:48.176
Vicks no? Man come here
will go to the bank and come.

27:53.534 --> 27:57.004
Hey Joe listen to what we say.
You stop there. - Leave me.

27:57.200 --> 28:01.171
I'm the son of a police officer who
lived in honesty till death. - So what?

28:01.300 --> 28:03.780
Since in debt I can't
steal other's property.

28:04.133 --> 28:07.273
Do you have any better idea than
this to clear off our debts? No is it?

28:07.400 --> 28:09.141
Then you don't have to be show off.

28:10.300 --> 28:14.146
(Being caught its a criminal
offence the consequences of that)

28:14.367 --> 28:17.109
My god is it so?

28:21.133 --> 28:22.771
What is it man?

28:23.433 --> 28:27.609
Going to end man, we all are going
to be finished by tomorrow evening.

28:28.167 --> 28:31.273
You tell the matter clearly.
Hey man Nam biars with one load...

28:31.433 --> 28:34.004
...of goons has started to catch us.

28:34.233 --> 28:39.046
Who told you this?
Chakara (Jaggery) - Chakara?

28:39.367 --> 28:44.646
Nothing at all. - In the world only
two things are defined as chakara.

28:45.033 --> 28:50.073
One is the jaggery for eating.
The second one girl who is loved.

28:51.167 --> 28:55.081
The first one in my knowledge
don't use mobile phone and all.

28:55.433 --> 28:58.243
Who is that man?
The second chakara only.

28:58.433 --> 29:01.107
The elder Nambiars wife Radha.

29:02.100 --> 29:05.570
What a pity!
In this I don't have any role.

29:06.167 --> 29:07.407
When was all this man?

29:07.600 --> 29:12.572
When we went to repay the money
which we borrowed, I met her.

29:12.767 --> 29:15.577
Then later to repay the interest
she used to give money.

29:15.800 --> 29:19.145
I'll pay to Nambiars she collects that
and gives to me through the back.

29:19.333 --> 29:20.141
How in between all this?

29:20.367 --> 29:23.007
Now when they asked the
borrowed money got trapped.

29:23.234 --> 29:26.238
Othenivise I would have carried
on like this giving and buying.

29:26.434 --> 29:32.316
Joe there is only one more day left.
Think and come to a decision.

29:36.234 --> 29:38.441
Buddy will steal.

29:49.767 --> 29:53.340
Devu mol!
Is there any new trip Pappetta?

29:53.467 --> 29:57.176
One trip has come to Benjapuri.
Three ladies for one week.

29:57.400 --> 30:00.074
Can you do it?- What can do it?
Who are the parties?

30:00.300 --> 30:02.644
Students from some college
in Ooty to take the documentary.

30:02.767 --> 30:05.008
Should go to Benjapuri
tomorrow morning by 9 o'clock.

30:05.167 --> 30:09.013
To Rama colony okay. - I know
Pappettan will do anything good to me.

30:09.167 --> 30:12.011
But still how is it regarding
the money? Is it neat set up?

30:12.167 --> 30:14.204
Why not really rich people.
My goodness.

30:14.400 --> 30:15.606
One person is the nephew of MP.

30:15.800 --> 30:18.280
On the resort there
was no bargain with us. - Is it so?

30:18.533 --> 30:22.640
God don't bargain with me also,
there are hundreds of needs.

30:23.000 --> 30:26.379
So sharp 9 o'clock, Devu will be
ready at the door step of resort.

30:30.100 --> 30:33.047

No, not like that.

31:34.400 --> 31:37.438
A com plete change for father.

31:38.167 --> 31:43.082
This is like a Jango style.
Whose mistake?

31:43.333 --> 31:48.305
When I told to cremate me
in between Xavier and Mathachan.

31:48.500 --> 31:51.276
Where did you cremate me?
Just think, near that lad Jimmy...

31:51.433 --> 31:53.504
...who was killed in an
accident in Bangalore.

31:53.734 --> 31:57.113
He is my present company

31:58.767 --> 32:03.614
Father have you met mother?
Why while being alive...

32:03.767 --> 32:06.008
...she never gave me peace of mind.

32:06.200 --> 32:08.680
Somehow escaped from
her and reached here.

32:09.000 --> 32:13.676
Never again I'll to that area.
So have you come only to see me?

32:14.033 --> 32:17.071
Then what a figure to see!

32:17.167 --> 32:19.738

was going this way.

32:20.800 --> 32:27.081
Hey are you going to rob a bank?
Father do you think the most honest...

32:27.200 --> 32:29.737
...police officer's son will do like that?

32:31.100 --> 32:33.740
Crap! Must do that!

32:34.333 --> 32:36.609
Hey fellow some how
try to make some money...

32:36.800 --> 32:39.303
...and clear debts and try to settle.

32:40.667 --> 32:44.080
I don't think that you can
make that money in a straightway.

32:44.333 --> 32:48.338
That is...
The idea what tutor told is good.

32:49.534 --> 32:54.313
Father! - You don't make it over.
I know you are half minded.

32:58.300 --> 33:03.045
In this situation like an angel, father
who should guide me in proper way.

33:03.233 --> 33:09.240
Son when there is chance to
be god why becoming an angel?

33:09.433 --> 33:12.107
So is it to steal?
Go and do it man.

33:12.333 --> 33:15.610
Just see this as a part of a big game.

33:15.767 --> 33:18.179
N Play?
Of that may!

33:20.667 --> 33:24.581
A play where you
are made to do by this universe.

33:27.767 --> 33:32.216
When there is chance to
be god why becoming an angel?

33:37.567 --> 33:40.343
For one week no need to
hear the scolding and shouting.

33:40.500 --> 33:42.776
The sister must be happy, no?

33:43.100 --> 33:47.014
There is nothing like that sister.
Let the marks of exams come...

33:47.134 --> 33:49.546

my real character.

33:53.133 --> 33:57.047

close to Indian President.

38:14.767 --> 38:18.112
Madam for your safety
only I arranged Devu's car.

38:18.334 --> 38:20.974
She very well knows the
nook and corner of Benjapur.

area is a bit problematic place.

Get in madam. Now when you got
angry with me I felt like Nayan Thara.

Some people used to
call me Nayan Thara.

39:17.167 --> 39:18.646
Really?

39:21.033 --> 39:23.274
If Nayan Thara comes to know this.

39:23.534 --> 39:25.377
This old lady will be bet
by sending hit men.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.143
Will go madam.

41:39.634 --> 41:42.410
...a helping hand for the thief.

41:42.667 --> 41:48.583
One who finds it is the real thief. In
this locality do you see anything?

41:48.734 --> 41:52.045
Seeing two auto, one tractor
and an old man.

41:53.567 --> 41:55.740
In front of that bank, there
is a fireworks shop.

41:57.434 --> 42:00.540
Again making us to do the
fireworks business or what?

42:00.800 --> 42:03.576
Then no fireworks will crack.

42:04.600 --> 42:08.047
We'll use that fire works
shop for our goal.

42:08.234 --> 42:10.578
I'll go there and light up that shop.

42:10.767 --> 42:15.079
On hearing the sound to that area
everyone's attention will be diverted.

42:15.234 --> 42:18.477
Miss understanding its a bomb
the staffs in the bank also runs.

42:18.667 --> 42:20.738
Total confusion.
For us also.

42:21.200 --> 42:22.235
That's your time.

42:25.434 --> 42:27.471
Man its an old theme by
saying elephant is scared...

42:27.600 --> 42:29.102
...and ruining the festival.

42:29.300 --> 42:34.113
Yes, my sir this black
dress, cap and toy gun.

42:34.234 --> 42:36.111
All together a Ramji Rao feeling.

42:36.300 --> 42:38.541
That was super hit, no?
Then what's the problem?

42:38.634 --> 42:42.138
Without black dress and toy gun no
bank robbery in the world has taken place.

42:42.400 --> 42:43.970
When I divert the attention.

42:46.434 --> 42:48.345
I'll go and come.

42:48.434 --> 42:50.778
Does someone among you, other
than me, wishes to go there?

42:51.100 --> 42:53.307
No need, the fireworks and
shooting sir is the best.

42:54.467 --> 42:55.639
Is it so?

42:57.334 --> 43:02.334
MC Movie Channel

One kilo fountain cracker?

43:22.500 --> 43:23.740

Potass five packets, rocket ten.
Six numbers of sparkle flowers.

43:30.700 --> 43:33.510
Eight numbers of 'Amittu'

43:56.367 --> 44:01.316
Buddy sir has taken the lighter. Most
probably there will be a blast now.

44:01.500 --> 44:02.740
We should be ready now.

44:08.600 --> 44:09.738
Will fire now.

44:11.434 --> 44:14.040
Buddy be ready. Ready the gun.

44:32.734 --> 44:34.213
My goodness diverted the attention.

44:37.267 --> 44:40.111

44:42.134 --> 44:45.377
What? Have Itaught you?
What's the name?

44:46.434 --> 44:48.072
What are you going to do?

44:52.100 --> 44:54.341
Sir, sir.
What happened?

44:54.734 --> 44:57.237
Not that why are you here?
Came for a funeral.

44:57.400 --> 45:01.143
Looks like he is dead, before
crow strikes will return it home.

45:01.300 --> 45:04.247
Take the vehicle.
Wait any way started.

45:04.767 --> 45:08.180
If there is a bank robbery in the
horoscope, can we deny it?

45:08.433 --> 45:09.343
Come.

45:41.167 --> 45:43.238
Should remember
one thing specially.

45:43.434 --> 45:48.645
Once we get inside we should
never call our names each other.

45:51.134 --> 45:53.637
Which means you are
not Joe you are Salman.

45:54.067 --> 45:55.603
He is Joe and I'm Um bidi.

45:55.767 --> 45:57.337
How is it?
Good idea, no?

45:57.434 --> 46:00.540
No doubt why our all the
business failed. Wear the mask.

46:03.067 --> 46:04.239
Where is the hole of this?

46:06.267 --> 46:08.338
Look at his face like a Chimpanzee.

46:08.467 --> 46:11.243
Don't make me call
your people who gave the birth.

46:12.534 --> 46:14.639
Lucky no one is paying attention.

46:17.134 --> 46:18.204
Get in.

46:22.033 --> 46:25.446
For everyone's attention, this
is a planned bank robbery.

46:26.067 --> 46:28.980
But no one get scared
we are not your enemies.

46:29.534 --> 46:30.239
Your friends.

46:31.134 --> 46:32.772
We don't intend to
harm anyone of you.

46:33.200 --> 46:36.613
Then why got inside this one?
Our aim is money in this bank.

46:36.800 --> 46:39.076
Or cash either one we should get it.

46:39.134 --> 46:42.206
If you try to obstruct us
you might lose life.

46:42.334 --> 46:45.281
If anything happens to you,
your boss is not at all bothered.

46:45.434 --> 46:48.244
If anything happens to boss,
you are also not bothered at all.

46:48.400 --> 46:49.777
Because of that we can reach
into a mutual agreement.

46:51.267 --> 46:52.769
What is this is it an earth quake?

46:53.134 --> 46:55.444
Get up man.
Salman get up.

46:55.567 --> 46:58.104
Don't do foolishness Joe.
Don't call the name.

46:58.200 --> 47:01.272
Are you the manger of this bank?
- Not that, l...Don't move.

47:01.534 --> 47:03.275
Are you the manager of this bank?

47:03.600 --> 47:06.581
Can't you hear asking? Are
you the manager of the bank?

47:07.034 --> 47:09.571
On hiding the eyes and pointing
the gun, If its like this I'll go okay.

47:09.734 --> 47:11.441
Was not able to see the eyes to
whom did you ask? - Leave it.

47:11.600 --> 47:13.079
Are you the manager of this bank?

47:13.267 --> 47:15.713
Yes, yes.
Then why are you not scared at all?

47:16.000 --> 47:17.343
Fear is there by mother there is fear.
Do you fear?

47:17.567 --> 47:20.138
Don't fear me man.
Where is the locker of the bank?

47:20.234 --> 47:22.236

Then take us there.

47:22.367 --> 47:24.540
But there is no money in that.
No money?

47:24.667 --> 47:27.409
Because of operation Kubera
the money in that is transferred.

47:27.500 --> 47:29.309
Who is that Subair
who did operation?

47:29.434 --> 47:31.414
No, not that. Because of catching
black money operation yesterday.

47:31.500 --> 47:33.377
Owners took the money and shifted.

47:33.500 --> 47:35.309

Simply did all this.

47:35.467 --> 47:36.775
Where are you?

47:37.500 --> 47:41.277

bank robberies. We are big robbers.

47:43.434 --> 47:45.072
Truly didn't know that.
Take the sound of bank robbers.

47:46.000 --> 47:47.536
Now tell where is the
locker of the bank?

47:47.700 --> 47:49.976
That is. - Where is the
locker? Over there.

47:50.267 --> 47:53.612
If what you are saying is not true.
No, there is no money here.

47:53.767 --> 47:56.338
Go and open it man.
Is it required to do it here?

47:56.467 --> 47:58.674

49:46.534 --> 49:49.674

hands and say good morning.

55:54.467 --> 55:57.175
This robbery in a busy
town centre at day time.

55:57.300 --> 56:00.076
This is the biggest example
of police inefficiency.

56:00.267 --> 56:03.646
Under the jurisdiction of Shivadas
frequently happening crimes.

56:03.767 --> 56:06.577
The people are on fear.
Against the police inefficiency.

56:06.767 --> 56:09.213
Political parties are already
on with agitation movements.

56:09.300 --> 56:11.337
Like SP office siege.

56:12.167 --> 56:16.172
While playing at camp you were put
in the local because I felt close.

56:16.333 --> 56:20.110
That has become an issue for me.
Sir that's to spoil my name. - Stop it man!

56:20.400 --> 56:23.381
Hey man are you a fool by
birth or are you acting as a fool?

56:23.567 --> 56:26.241

56:40.767 --> 56:43.976
Simply say what had
happened, hide not.

56:45.100 --> 56:48.445
They were hard core three terrorists.

56:48.600 --> 56:50.773
Three were wearing black dress.

56:52.467 --> 56:54.469
What did you say?

56:54.634 --> 56:58.047
That is black shirt and
black pants, uniform.

56:58.167 --> 56:59.009
Saying that is what was worn.

57:01.267 --> 57:02.746
Three black men.

57:08.167 --> 57:09.578
Sir what all things
have you told about me?

57:09.734 --> 57:11.736
I'll only do foolish things
and say foolishness.

57:12.367 --> 57:15.712
Saying simply taking selfie, But with
the same selfie which sir ridiculed.

57:16.134 --> 57:17.977
I'm going to catch them sir.

57:18.334 --> 57:21.372
I saw them took the selfie also.

57:21.633 --> 57:25.012
Using that photo only
we are going to catch them.

57:25.100 --> 57:28.638
Here sir open the eyes and see.
Promotion for me and along...

57:29.100 --> 57:30.408
...with that for sir also.

57:31.334 --> 57:34.042
This donkey.

57:34.334 --> 57:38.305
See it fully what did you
think of Shinka Shivadas?

57:38.567 --> 57:45.348
The terrorist the robbers. You don't
get scared by seeing them. I'll nab them.

58:01.067 --> 58:04.446
Sir are you enquiring on Nambiar
and Nambiar robbery case?

58:04.634 --> 58:05.612
No don't shout.

58:05.734 --> 58:07.042
Ask one after the another.

58:07.634 --> 58:11.582
First child may ask. Ladies first, no?

58:11.733 --> 58:14.612
You may ask. - What is that you

Look some water.

58:23.667 --> 58:25.442
What?

58:25.600 --> 58:29.104
Water! Why not making us to
start one mineral water com pany?

58:29.300 --> 58:33.339
Before dying must give some
water, buy something and give.

58:33.500 --> 58:37.243
Why saying like this and all?
Stop somewhere if there is shop.

58:37.367 --> 58:40.610
Or he will die in this.
He is not a tutor should be a MLA.

58:40.767 --> 58:44.340
If that is the case will get lot of hits
and bites from assembly freely.

58:44.434 --> 58:47.381
Come out drink water and say new
idea and collect some hits, no?

58:47.567 --> 58:49.638
Even the Einstein's idea
got duped then what's there?

58:50.000 --> 58:51.411
Drag and pull out man.
Am I a cattle?

58:51.567 --> 58:53.410

one who takes the cow's milk.

59:06.200 --> 59:07.270
Lim by An nan?

59:07.400 --> 59:08.766
<i>Not Limby Anna“. Limbianno.</i>

59:08.767 --> 59:09.575
Which means lime juice.

59:10.100 --> 59:12.307
So for the tea will
it be Shashi annan?

59:12.500 --> 59:14.104
No for tea its called coffee here.

59:15.100 --> 59:17.637
Man turn off the phone.
Its mother from home.

59:18.100 --> 59:20.137

We are the ones who
came to rob the bank.

59:51.534 --> 59:53.571
I and Joe came to rob the bank.

59:53.733 --> 59:58.148
We didn't get the money to pay rent
for black uniform and toy guns.

59:58.367 --> 01:00:01.371
How come lady your husband
and brother are such poor men?

01:00:01.534 --> 01:00:03.741
Jerks, lady tell them to hang and die.

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:06.781
By the by was able to give
good whacks to your husband.

01:00:07.434 --> 01:00:10.005
Look we are escaping
from here for 3 to 4 days.

Not yet decided to where. Now on
the Banjapura route via Mysore.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:16.279
We are going to Bangalore.

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:20.007
Chakara apart from both
of us, no one should know this.

01:00:20.167 --> 01:00:24.479
Now when I return back, you give
sleeping pills to your stupid husband.

01:00:24.634 --> 01:00:28.343

...give full time sleeping pills.

01:00:30.267 --> 01:00:32.577

01:00:32.767 --> 01:00:36.010
Sometimes I'll switch off the mobile.
In between I'll come in the WhatsApp.

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:38.237
Okay Chakara, kisses.

01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:42.238
Hey you lady!

01:00:43.633 --> 01:00:46.546

01:01:03.767 --> 01:01:06.441
There is a clear evidence received
that the offenders had left the state.

01:01:06.567 --> 01:01:10.481
If they hide any where they will be
exposed and brought before the law.

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:13.513

Shivadas told media persons.

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:20.017
Who fight against private monopoly.
Behind this its Maoist. Its our evaluation.

01:01:20.133 --> 01:01:23.546
Maoist? - Disguised as Ayyappa
pilgrims to misguide everyone.

01:01:23.634 --> 01:01:27.241
We doubt they are trying
to destroy the belief in god.

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:32.645
Perhaps there is a chance it can be
planned move of Dawood Ibrahim gang.

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:35.406
Within the last one month...
Don't say anything from here.

By using latest technology
what police understands is...

01:01:46.434 --> 01:01:50.610
...the offenders are highly
educated IT professionals.

01:01:50.767 --> 01:01:55.512

01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:58.080

But it will feel like a
joke, honestly.

01:10:32.667 --> 01:10:36.615
Want coffee?
Says wants to burn this car.

01:10:37.234 --> 01:10:40.340
If we don't cool it by pouring water
soon, the car will burn automatically.

01:10:40.734 --> 01:10:44.238
Christ aren't you yet
satisfied on testing us?

01:10:46.267 --> 01:10:49.373
Madam this car and
people are similar.

01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:52.310
Suppose madam had
an attack at this very moment.

01:10:52.767 --> 01:10:53.370
Did it come?

01:10:53.667 --> 01:10:55.146
Simply saying rubbish.

01:10:55.334 --> 01:10:58.281
Suppose, madam was struck by a
thunder bold! - My god.

01:10:58.434 --> 01:11:01.142
No need, enough.
I was just saying an example.

01:11:01.334 --> 01:11:05.680
Car is also a creature, no? Can't say
when and how anything happens.

01:11:06.101 --> 01:11:13.212
MC Movie Channel

01:11:14.334 --> 01:11:18.544
Look there will be some streams
nearby. We'll go and check it.

01:11:18.701 --> 01:11:20.738
We are not coming, go alone.

01:11:23.634 --> 01:11:31.485
Okay I'll go and come. If any tiger or
bear comes climb on that tree.

01:11:32.101 --> 01:11:36.015
Nothing to fear when they are
in good mood they won't harm us.

01:11:36.134 --> 01:11:39.240
You shouldn't hurt them. I'll
come back and put you down.

01:11:41.101 --> 01:11:42.739
Are you coming or not?

01:11:45.434 --> 01:11:49.712
(God if said not coming I
would have gone all alone)

01:12:17.634 --> 01:12:21.343
What a forest is this? Not
even a jackfru it to eat.

01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:25.141
Is it proverty?
Anyway we'll go to jail.

01:12:25.267 --> 01:12:27.372
So what? -After killing you and
throwing you in an abyss.

01:12:27.567 --> 01:12:30.411
We can go in relief
that we did a holy thing.

01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:31.410
All that is a sin.

01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:35.038
None of the students
should have a tutor like this.

01:12:35.301 --> 01:12:41.081
Calm down, calm, Socrates, Pluto
what more even the great Che Guevara.

01:12:41.267 --> 01:12:45.443
Was a misunderstood identities.
- Started. If this is my Bolivian woods.

01:12:45.701 --> 01:12:48.409
I'm happy to be a
part of those great men.

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:52.742
Che Guevara of poor people wearing
shoes still now you are not on ground.

01:12:53.534 --> 01:12:58.176
While studying we have not paid
fees that is the only mistake we did.

01:12:58.634 --> 01:13:05.711
I'm hungry. - If it was original gun
I would have blown your brain.

01:13:06.434 --> 01:13:09.347
Like said I'm hungry.
I'm very hungry.

01:13:09.601 --> 01:13:12.343
Then swallow this.
Swallow this.

Look!
Here! Did you see him?

01:13:51.167 --> 01:13:55.047
Nothing to say if you have
anything to say to your wife. Say it.

01:13:55.167 --> 01:13:57.147
She is more than you.
I'm going to kill you.

01:13:57.401 --> 01:14:00.439
Its better to die than
living with her. Go on kill.

01:14:00.734 --> 01:14:05.615
What?
Where? Look there.

01:14:05.767 --> 01:14:08.714
Did you see? - Full of dust.
Can't see anything.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.412
Look through this.
Meriless fellow no? Won't see anything.

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:13.546
Can't see anything in this.
Through this look there.

01:14:15.334 --> 01:14:18.543
I, 2, 3, 4...Is it tiger?
Fear not I'm there no?

01:14:19.467 --> 01:14:22.243
Hey man over there.
Fear not Salman.

01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:36.003
They are coming
here female Maoist.

01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:39.238
My heavens! - Did that Bolivian
frog go which was sitting here?

01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:43.780
Hold this.
Hey Joe, female Maoist run!

01:14:44.067 --> 01:14:47.014
Female Maoist?
Shall I come?-Jump and come.

01:14:47.234 --> 01:14:49.111
Go slowly.
Let me finish this. Stop.

01:14:49.267 --> 01:14:51.679
Don't kill me Maoist.
I've not come with them.

01:14:52.001 --> 01:14:54.607
Came to see an estate. - No one has
caught you. Got stuck in a shoot.

01:14:54.801 --> 01:14:57.407
Wait!

01:14:59.167 --> 01:15:00.976
Umbidi!

01:15:02.267 --> 01:15:03.575
Salman!

01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:05.301
Tutor!

01:15:07.767 --> 01:15:09.246
Meera Madam!

01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:21.505
Where are you all?

01:15:36.267 --> 01:15:36.768
Can't!

01:15:44.534 --> 01:15:46.536
My mother!

01:15:50.167 --> 01:15:51.544
Water!
Snake!

01:15:52.667 --> 01:15:57.673
My god king cobra. -Where?
Came to ask whether snake is there?

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.480
Go man monkey.
No need fear king cobra.

01:16:00.701 --> 01:16:04.547
In the time of death
telling snake and killing.

01:16:04.734 --> 01:16:09.240
Cowards! We can escape
just listen what I say.

01:16:10.234 --> 01:16:13.044
Again?
Salman don't you know?

01:16:13.267 --> 01:16:14.473
Its said that when one
is missed, then its for three.

01:16:14.667 --> 01:16:16.704
Hey man don't listen
to what this stupid says.

01:16:17.034 --> 01:16:19.105
You bear I'm saying not to be stupid.

01:16:22.734 --> 01:16:27.740
I'm sure they will kill us.
I can't now what is the way?

01:16:28.434 --> 01:16:30.038
I'll say.

01:16:30.601 --> 01:16:31.238
Tell.

01:16:35.134 --> 01:16:39.344
Enough, my god. When she
finishes saying we'll be cremated.

01:16:39.434 --> 01:16:43.712
I'll catch the leg please trust me.
What is he man?

01:16:43.801 --> 01:16:45.610
The shoes stinks!
Leave the leg.

01:16:46.467 --> 01:16:50.973
Now you listen what I say.
Tell. - Do you have gun in hand?

01:16:51.134 --> 01:16:53.239
Yes.
Then walk in the front.

01:16:53.467 --> 01:16:55.743
I'll be there at the back.
Is it needed?

01:16:56.100 --> 01:16:57.511
Will walk.
Come.

01:16:57.701 --> 01:16:59.772
Spread the chest and walk.
So the bullet hits on your chest, no?

01:17:00.067 --> 01:17:02.240
My god! Again coming Maoist.
Hands up!

01:17:04.501 --> 01:17:07.971
Why hands up for us?
Point gun on head and say hands up.

01:17:11.101 --> 01:17:13.047
Don't move.
Hands up.

01:17:14.767 --> 01:17:18.374
Is it okay?
What a pity!

01:17:20.301 --> 01:17:23.407
Now don't listen to what he says.
Give the gun to them.

01:17:24.101 --> 01:17:25.978
Here is the gun.

01:17:29.334 --> 01:17:32.076
No bullet that's a toy gun.

01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:34.744
One more gun is there which
sprays the water do you want that?

01:17:36.301 --> 01:17:38.406
Give that one also.
No need it seems.

01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:44.470
Tutor!

01:17:47.667 --> 01:17:52.667
MC Movie Channel

01:18:31.301 --> 01:18:33.542
Joe!
Cheat!

01:19:23.100 --> 01:19:29.415
I was losing the faith in god. No.
God is there otherwise after years.

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:32.071
You won't come
in front of me like this.

01:19:34.267 --> 01:19:36.713
Yesterday a person who is
very dear to me came and told.

01:19:37.034 --> 01:19:42.006
Now on whatever I do this universe
will be there with me. True.

01:19:43.467 --> 01:19:47.745
Devayani or is it your real name?
I don't have fear.

01:19:49.034 --> 01:19:50.536
L...l don't...
Buddy!

01:19:51.501 --> 01:19:54.107
They are not female
Maoist like we thought.

01:19:54.267 --> 01:19:57.043
When seen in the forest felt
like that. - Really poor ones.

01:19:57.301 --> 01:19:58.041
Hey man this is.

01:19:59.300 --> 01:20:04.300
MC Movie Channel

01:20:21.067 --> 01:20:25.072
A sorrowful millionaire. -A poor one.
Sometimes the sorrow will be more.

01:20:25.234 --> 01:20:27.407
At that time we apply Vicks is it not?

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.709
I've seen Mr. Joe somewhere.

01:20:33.801 --> 01:20:38.011
There is no chance...
Seems Meera didn't understand person.

01:20:38.167 --> 01:20:44.379
In the modern economics, out
of the best ten thesis, one is his.

01:20:45.134 --> 01:20:47.705
He has got ten heads.
The real Ravana.

01:20:50.401 --> 01:20:53.280
May be true, Meera might
have seen him at the airport.

01:20:57.734 --> 01:21:01.204
Being a millionaire has got
a house inside the airport.

01:21:01.634 --> 01:21:05.241
Buddy like us they also lost the
way and came to the forest.

01:21:05.434 --> 01:21:07.710
What all losing is there.
Leave! - Left!

01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:11.410
The way was not lost was
made to lose. - Again started.

01:21:11.534 --> 01:21:14.242
The place where ourjeep
was there? I know over there.

01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:20.546
Over here.
Shifted to there. When was it?

01:21:20.634 --> 01:21:22.238
May be wild elephant.

01:21:24.267 --> 01:21:25.541
Where else is Joe
having the business?

01:21:25.734 --> 01:21:27.042
Apart from Germany and Singapore.

01:21:27.134 --> 01:21:32.277
China, Russia, Lithuania all other places
where Lal Jose sir has gone for tour.

01:21:32.434 --> 01:21:34.072
Only in America its not there.
Why is that?

01:21:34.167 --> 01:21:35.407
A problem with panchayat president.

01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:37.202
Mentioned earlier, Wall Street
is in America, no?

01:21:37.334 --> 01:21:40.110
That is a different panchayat.
I don't stay there permanently.

01:21:40.267 --> 01:21:42.543
I'll go and come.
Sometime goes and comes.

01:21:42.667 --> 01:21:44.647
Let them go.

01:21:57.334 --> 01:22:00.110
You stay there.
What have you told?

01:22:00.367 --> 01:22:03.576
You are a big business person.
When you get up on doing business.

01:22:03.801 --> 01:22:06.407
You will visit all the
forest in the world.

01:22:06.534 --> 01:22:09.538
Like Vatmiki a life of a non resident
without nest and company.

01:22:09.767 --> 01:22:11.474
What is all this for?
The last way.

01:22:12.134 --> 01:22:14.239
Do you know who is this
Meera's uncle? I don't know.

01:22:14.434 --> 01:22:18.610
MP Xavier Aug ustine. - So what?
Her one word will save us.

01:22:19.767 --> 01:22:23.408
Messed up.
Alibi, that action. which means.

01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:25.537
Over there when the bank
robbery happened. At that time.

01:22:25.667 --> 01:22:30.207
We were with them in
this forest, the evidence.

01:22:30.334 --> 01:22:33.975
If you lure her we'll
escape from this trap.

01:22:34.134 --> 01:22:35.408
Why soap, banana
peel is enough, no?

01:22:36.734 --> 01:22:38.179
Why a conspiracy over there?

01:22:38.734 --> 01:22:40.577
I'll come there.
I'll also come.

01:22:41.267 --> 01:22:42.245
You come.

01:22:42.367 --> 01:22:44.540
Madam you said as a part
of research you are going...

01:22:44.667 --> 01:22:46.738
...to Tibetan Colony
at Benjapur, is it? - Yes.

01:22:47.101 --> 01:22:49.308
This Joe knows Tibetan
language very well.

01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:52.244
Is it so?

01:22:54.100 --> 01:22:57.377
If no otherjob is there.
For him what job?

01:22:57.567 --> 01:22:59.672
Even though he has got
a business that gives one...

01:22:59.767 --> 01:23:02.543
...crore profit, he'll come with us.

01:23:02.734 --> 01:23:05.681
That is our friend.
Might have duped.

01:23:06.434 --> 01:23:11.440
Fellows will you all kill me? - A last
chance to escape, don't talk you come.

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:13.773
This is the place where elephant
comes. Do you fear elephant?

01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:17.047
I don't fear my home had an elephant.
- Then where is it?

01:23:17.234 --> 01:23:19.737
Mother burned that.
Why? - That was made of wood.

01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:21.443
Burned it as firewood.

01:23:22.034 --> 01:23:24.776
While walking have we reached
Shabarimal, hearing the salutations.

01:23:25.667 --> 01:23:28.204
That is not Shabarimala
or Salutations.

01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:31.240
Somewhere near only
there is 'Pancharapulmaidu'

01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:33.744
To see the water falls over
there tourists used to come.

01:23:34.134 --> 01:23:37.081
If its tourists, then tourist will go
and eat what they have left behind.

01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:41.046
Don't finish all.
Good chicken smell.

01:23:41.301 --> 01:23:43.781
That's this tutor's smell.
You guys smell and walk.

01:23:44.101 --> 01:23:46.604

one more kissing protest, no?

Its a forest with tiger and elephant
its risky to travel at night.

01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:22.147
What they say is by sleeping
here today. Tomorrow morning...

01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:24.302
...anyway they are going
to high way will drop us.

01:24:24.534 --> 01:24:28.107
Man, this ladies, chicken, liquor.

01:24:28.434 --> 01:24:33.042
No need?
Only sleeping here. - No other way.

01:24:33.267 --> 01:24:35.747

01:30:52.300 --> 01:30:55.577
Open the mouth and say something
I've been noticing you from yesterday.

01:30:55.700 --> 01:30:57.577

01:30:57.734 --> 01:31:01.079

01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:27.749
Three years back when I was running
a travel agency at Shim la.

01:31:28.434 --> 01:31:31.415
Good income, good standard of life.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:36.346
But still leaving away from home,
that loneliness and being alone tormented.

01:31:37.034 --> 01:31:44.316
Those times when mother's phone calls
and letters were regarded as treasure.

01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:53.745
As a part of tourism promotion
councils art festival.

01:31:54.234 --> 01:31:58.239
The logistics of Kadhakali group
from Kerala. My travel agency...

01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:00.243
...was in charge of it.

01:32:00.434 --> 01:32:04.246
When I went to welcome them, it
was then I saw her for the first time.

01:32:05.267 --> 01:32:10.267
"Did the horn bill eyes Search
did the lantern smile awaken?"

01:32:18.401 --> 01:32:23.401

Did the blush glide till sky?"

01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:47.508
"Horn bill eyes..."

01:32:47.667 --> 01:32:51.479
Her smartness in uniting
people with various character.

01:32:52.034 --> 01:32:56.608
By smiling and joking to everyone
she made those days live.

Are you a Malayali?
Till one year back, now a local here.

01:33:24.667 --> 01:33:29.207
Then inside the vehicle
when we were mocking you.

01:33:29.434 --> 01:33:33.576
Never mind generally people talk
more dirty things about me.

01:33:36.267 --> 01:33:39.248
So at five I'll come.

01:34:19.034 --> 01:34:23.005
At Himachal Pradesh

01:34:23.234 --> 01:34:26.443
For 3 weeks I traveled
with that troupe.

01:34:26.634 --> 01:34:31.208
The attraction felt in the first sight.
Later developed to adoration and love.

01:34:31.367 --> 01:34:36.214
Don't know when it was. -I also
felt she was attracted to me.

01:34:40.634 --> 01:34:46.585
"At a distance there is a shadow
play of long waited girl"

01:34:47.134 --> 01:34:53.517

"The lantern"

01:37:19.001 --> 01:37:24.451
During the boredom days at Shimla.
My best friend was a Buddhist monk.

01:37:24.567 --> 01:37:26.444
Named Song Pang.

01:37:27.167 --> 01:37:32.776
He was the main Lama in Buddhist
monastery was Song Pang.

01:37:33.134 --> 01:37:36.980
When the work tension increases
when missing mother a lot.

01:37:37.134 --> 01:37:42.379
During those times Lama
was a strength and relief to me.

01:37:45.201 --> 01:37:48.705
One night when I returned after
the program of Kadhakali troupe.

01:37:49.067 --> 01:37:51.377
Song Pang Lama came to
the place where I stay.

01:37:51.534 --> 01:37:53.104
Along with another Lama.

01:37:53.267 --> 01:37:56.271
On the Song Pang face there was
fear and disbelief which was never...

01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:57.708
...seen by me.

01:37:58.067 --> 01:38:00.274
He handed me a bag.

01:38:00.801 --> 01:38:05.250
It has got a main book on Buddhist
religion. As soon as possible it has...

01:38:05.367 --> 01:38:07.574
...to reach a monastery at Karnataka.

01:38:07.767 --> 01:38:11.214
Also told that sacred
book is not safe at Simla.

01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:14.643
That is handed over to
me as I'm trustful...

01:38:14.767 --> 01:38:18.146
...and never open it
till it reaches Karnataka.

01:38:18.367 --> 01:38:22.110
When it reaches over there safely
that blessing will come to me later.

01:38:22.234 --> 01:38:25.181
Blessed me and walked off swiftly.

01:38:37.134 --> 01:38:41.378
Today one journey is there to
Karnataka. An urgency of our Lama.

01:38:41.567 --> 01:38:44.571
To go after calling you, you
don't have a mobile in hand, no?

01:38:44.767 --> 01:38:46.769
While calling uncle, there
will be hundreds of questions.

01:38:47.067 --> 01:38:54.246
So that is why came this way.
No before going felt like seeing you.

01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:57.438
Is that okay?
Your ego doesn't permit to accept that.

01:38:57.634 --> 01:39:01.047
No ego at all highness. You
give the number at native place.

01:39:01.300 --> 01:39:04.076
Anyway one day will have
to come in search of you.

01:39:04.334 --> 01:39:05.608
Sure.
Why not sure?

01:39:10.401 --> 01:39:11.277
Yea tell.

01:39:22.267 --> 01:39:24.406
You wait there.

01:39:26.101 --> 01:39:27.637
What happened Joe?

01:39:29.734 --> 01:39:32.442
That is...When I come back I'll tell.

01:39:34.267 --> 01:39:38.044
Devu can you keep this bag?
I'll take when I come back.

01:40:17.767 --> 01:40:21.408
Previous night along with Song
Pang the Lama that I saw.

01:40:21.601 --> 01:40:24.081
I saw he was taken to hospital.

01:41:02.267 --> 01:41:07.774
As if in a mediation in that snow
Song Pang Lama lay dead and freezed.

01:41:11.267 --> 01:41:15.079
At Shimla he was my
only friend, relief and shelter.

01:41:15.134 --> 01:41:16.670
Couldn't believe.

01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:20.713
At night I went to collect the bag
which Song Pang Lama handed to me.

01:41:21.034 --> 01:41:23.105
I went to Devayani's staying place.

01:41:28.567 --> 01:41:32.413
What is this?
Why at this time?

01:41:32.567 --> 01:41:35.741
Ito see Devayani.
She has gone.

01:41:36.567 --> 01:41:40.071
Gone? To where?
Didn't she tell you anything?

01:41:41.067 --> 01:41:43.411
No.
So she cheated you also, isn't it?

01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:49.978
To cheat? -I felt on saying
urgent, I must go and when escaped.

01:41:50.134 --> 01:41:53.547
She has got something
heavy from here.

01:41:54.500 --> 01:41:58.573
Sir...I'm asking about Devayani
who had come with you.

01:41:58.734 --> 01:42:01.408
Yes child the very same Devayani.

01:42:01.634 --> 01:42:03.136
She is a thief.

01:42:04.534 --> 01:42:09.745
Although she is a distant relative
of mine. Father and mother is dead.

01:42:10.101 --> 01:42:12.672
On seeing the hardship to take
care of sick grandma and sibling...

01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:17.408
...that's why I took her along
although she is a cheat.

01:42:18.167 --> 01:42:23.082
But must say while coming
like this a great help for me.

01:42:24.601 --> 01:42:26.740
But sometimes this is the character.

01:42:28.234 --> 01:42:32.740
On seeing you were getting close
to her I felt like stopping it.

01:42:34.134 --> 01:42:35.408
Then I...

01:42:37.367 --> 01:42:46.082
Did you lose any money?
Her house, any phone number?

01:42:46.234 --> 01:42:48.976
For cheaters is there
any native or home?

01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:54.550
As phone numbers I'll give as much
as numbers. Won't get her in any.

01:42:56.534 --> 01:42:58.775
If you want you give a
complaint to police.

01:42:59.101 --> 01:43:03.675
She has left from here by evening
bus at 4:30 Delhi-Shimla bus.

01:43:04.567 --> 01:43:06.444
I know only this much.

01:43:17.634 --> 01:43:21.172
When I enquired later I came
to know what he told is true.

01:43:21.601 --> 01:43:24.741
From Tourism Promotion Council
came to know she has left in...

01:43:25.067 --> 01:43:26.444
...Shim la-Delhi bus.

01:43:28.334 --> 01:43:31.679
Is it on losing that sacred
book handed to me with trust?

01:43:32.001 --> 01:43:36.279
Or is it on receiving deception from the
first girl loved by me, I got scattered?

01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:37.470
I don't know.

01:43:44.701 --> 01:43:49.673
Without my knowledge a feeling
I destroyed Buddhist monk's trust.

01:43:50.534 --> 01:43:54.243
Then I couldn't stay at
Shimla, I left that place.

01:43:55.334 --> 01:43:58.747
But later what happened
in life was tragedy.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.571
What is the tragedy which
you had so much?

01:44:01.734 --> 01:44:05.045
What more tragedy than you?

01:44:05.333 --> 01:44:10.305
The next day when he returned
from Shimla, sir landed in our life.

01:44:13.467 --> 01:44:20.009
Whatever you say along with
her for any matter, I'm not there.

01:44:20.167 --> 01:44:23.410
Has not told you to love
by singing duet with her.

01:44:23.534 --> 01:44:27.346
Some how beg with that Meera
Mam an and escape from here.

01:44:27.534 --> 01:44:29.138
I can't beg with any lady.

01:44:29.267 --> 01:44:32.578
Forget about the hardship and
proverty in my and his house.

01:44:32.700 --> 01:44:33.678
Leave his case also.

01:44:34.034 --> 01:44:38.107
But you've a mother who
has great expectations on you.

01:44:38.767 --> 01:44:42.044
After your house confiscation
mother will have to go to road side.

01:44:42.134 --> 01:44:45.445
She won't be having money
with her to meet you at the jail.

01:44:46.767 --> 01:44:49.043
For you grudge is more
important towards a...

01:44:49.268 --> 01:44:50.679
...girl who cheated you long back.

01:44:50.801 --> 01:44:53.714
We can sit here itself by eating
leaves till the police comes.

01:44:54.301 --> 01:44:55.109

Meera why are we
here in this hotel?

01:46:08.534 --> 01:46:11.378
I called uncle and booked
a room here for all of us.

01:46:11.467 --> 01:46:14.209
After getting fresh we can go
to see monasteries over here.

01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:18.271
Man booked a room in this hotel.
Is all this required?

01:46:18.467 --> 01:46:22.005
While we were coming we've already
booked a room for all of us at Taj.

01:46:22.134 --> 01:46:23.613
On telling earlier could
have canceled that room.

01:46:23.767 --> 01:46:27.237
Already paid the full cash also.
For that there is no Taj hotel here.

01:46:28.268 --> 01:46:29.770
No?
No. - Why is that?

01:46:30.334 --> 01:46:35.249
He is telling about Bangalore Taj,
this is Banjapura that is Bangalore.

01:46:35.367 --> 01:46:38.405
Got confused, after this
gets over we'll go there okay.

01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:40.238
Booked in Bangalore.

01:46:42.434 --> 01:46:43.071
Who is this?

01:46:49.300 --> 01:46:51.211
Malayalam will do, no?

01:46:51.667 --> 01:46:53.408
God Devutty.

01:46:54.534 --> 01:46:56.036
When did you come out from jail?

01:47:00.300 --> 01:47:01.574
A small marijuana case.

01:47:05.434 --> 01:47:07.778
Her companies are good.
Didn't I tell?

01:47:08.100 --> 01:47:09.579
Moideen Ekka stays
near our house.

01:47:09.700 --> 01:47:12.579
Married to marijuana that
is what is said at the native.

01:47:12.667 --> 01:47:15.079
But there is no harm okay.
Thank you daughter.

01:47:15.267 --> 01:47:17.406
So if you need
anything in Banjapura...

01:47:21.101 --> 01:47:24.378
Not that, that sir I've seen
somewhere. - Me?

01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:25.305
No.
I've seen.

01:47:25.500 --> 01:47:31.109
Seems has not understood him
properly in the modern economics.

01:47:31.234 --> 01:47:32.770
Stop it. What is this?

01:47:33.134 --> 01:47:35.580
That was him.
Okay Moideen we'll call.

01:48:25.367 --> 01:48:27.711
Meera are you searching
anything in particular?

01:48:28.001 --> 01:48:30.538
Not that all the paintings
were closely watched.

01:48:30.734 --> 01:48:34.181
5 Tibetans that is the name of
the painting which I'm searching.

01:48:34.267 --> 01:48:38.443
After the Tibetan revolt in 70's it is
said that painting came to India.

01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:40.773
Here in Banjapura in some
Buddhist temple its there.

01:48:41.067 --> 01:48:42.444
Among the researchers
there is an opinion like that.

01:48:42.601 --> 01:48:46.105
But because of the strict rules
over here, in the prayer rooms where...

01:48:46.267 --> 01:48:48.110
...there are paintings photography
is strictly prohibited.

01:48:48.267 --> 01:48:48.677
Is that one present here?

01:48:48.767 --> 01:48:51.509
No one so far has confirmed
whether its present here or not.

01:48:51.667 --> 01:48:56.082
The authorities in the monastery keep
away from the questions of researchers.

01:48:56.201 --> 01:48:59.239
5 Tibetans if we get a
photograph of that.

01:48:59.467 --> 01:49:02.676
This research of mine
will be a wonder in India.

01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:04.643
If not received from here, there
are other monasteries in India.

01:49:04.801 --> 01:49:06.109
We'll search there.

01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:10.140
You come.
In their expense will tour India.

01:49:24.234 --> 01:49:28.114
The car pushed by
me and driver girl, isn't she?

01:49:31.601 --> 01:49:34.605
Have you reached here?
Now is the car having any complaints?

01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:37.713
No sir.
Is everyone staying here?

01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:40.713
Yes sir.
Also our Meera Mam an.

01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:43.974
Yea in 102.
Now will she be at the room?

01:49:44.101 --> 01:49:46.377
Now gone for shooting after
sometime will come back.

01:49:46.534 --> 01:49:49.037
Okay, okay I'll meet.

01:49:49.167 --> 01:49:52.512
On seeing the girls won't
leave, no? Come sir without flirting.

01:49:52.601 --> 01:49:54.171
If you carry on like
this they will leave India.

01:49:54.301 --> 01:49:56.474
I'll kick both of you and
sink you in the oil bed!

01:49:56.701 --> 01:49:59.511
Do you think no one knows about
your black money? - Black money!

01:49:59.667 --> 01:50:03.171
Let me get them, I'll strip all.

01:50:03.367 --> 01:50:05.244
Leave sir!

01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:11.241
What you get from them not 10%
will pay 20% commission.

01:50:11.634 --> 01:50:17.550
I'll tolerate anything. But, come here.
Insulting in front of girls, I won't allow.

01:50:19.534 --> 01:50:22.515
Go and ready the rooms
for sifs to rest.

01:50:22.667 --> 01:50:24.112
Okay sir.
Go, go.

01:50:25.467 --> 01:50:27.572
Sir what is the issue?

01:50:27.767 --> 01:50:32.011
There is a problem,
I'll tell. Nataraj! Child come.

01:50:33.567 --> 01:50:38.983
Look, now left Nambiar's bank was
robbed there is an international gang.

01:50:39.234 --> 01:50:40.679
Came to catch them.

01:50:41.134 --> 01:50:44.308
They have reached Bejapura
that's the intelligence report.

01:50:44.501 --> 01:50:47.107
Child, do you remember
seeing them any where?

01:50:50.601 --> 01:50:55.601
MC Movie Channel

01:51:20.634 --> 01:51:23.046
Have you seen?
Do you know them?

01:51:26.100 --> 01:51:27.238
Do you know?

01:51:28.134 --> 01:51:29.204
I know sir!

01:51:29.801 --> 01:51:31.678
Where? Where are they?

01:51:32.100 --> 01:51:35.309
Little while ago they have come
here asking for the way to Sinthicop.

01:51:35.434 --> 01:51:37.380
Saw swiftly going there also.

01:51:37.567 --> 01:51:38.705
<i>Sunthicope'.!</i>

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:42.379
The saints here shave
their heads in that place.

01:51:43.667 --> 01:51:46.671
The place where the
sainthood is received.

01:51:50.134 --> 01:51:53.274
By shaving the heads and changing
the dress. That's their plan.

01:52:29.567 --> 01:52:33.105
Hey girl thief! What have you
stolen and running?

01:52:35.601 --> 01:52:39.481
No nothing big, running after
stealing that Nam biar & Nam biar bank.

01:52:42.100 --> 01:52:43.078
Why, joining?

01:52:57.567 --> 01:53:01.572
Right from yesterday I wanted to ask
what did I do? For you to call me thief.

01:53:01.734 --> 01:53:03.645
Or is it to hide own theft?

01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:07.213
Today is September 21. Three
years back on the same day.

01:53:07.367 --> 01:53:11.406
The first girl whom I loved
in life cheated me and left.

01:53:17.134 --> 01:53:19.239
On that day started my tragedies.

01:53:19.767 --> 01:53:22.407
What you told now
even that bank robbery.

01:53:23.500 --> 01:53:25.980
September 21.

01:53:26.167 --> 01:53:28.738
The day which I can
never forget in life.

01:53:39.234 --> 01:53:41.009
Hallo, yes.

01:53:44.334 --> 01:53:45.574
When?

01:53:46.600 --> 01:53:47.635
How?

01:53:49.434 --> 01:53:53.143
Over here, will give.
Will say like that.

01:54:02.267 --> 01:54:05.146
Child.
What is it uncle?

01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:06.777
Please come here.

01:54:07.434 --> 01:54:09.107
Will come now okay.

01:54:10.467 --> 01:54:13.141
What is it?
From home.

01:54:13.434 --> 01:54:14.412
From home?

01:54:16.201 --> 01:54:18.272
Hello. Devumol.
Devu here.

01:54:18.434 --> 01:54:20.641
Child, you father is not feeling well.

01:54:21.134 --> 01:54:23.512
Nothing to worry a small chest pain.

01:54:23.801 --> 01:54:28.079
Admitted in the hospital.
We are all at hospital.

01:54:28.267 --> 01:54:30.577
Child do one thing
come fast to native.

01:54:30.767 --> 01:54:37.446
Although Balamama has told father
is not well. I could read from his voice.

01:54:38.234 --> 01:54:40.737
Along with us there is no father.

01:54:47.100 --> 01:54:51.378
I couldn't adjust to the
fact that father is dead.

01:54:52.267 --> 01:54:56.545
From uncle's phone I tried
to contact Joe several times.

01:54:56.734 --> 01:54:58.577
Didn't get. At last...

01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:04.613
Joe of travel agency
handed over this bag to me.

01:55:05.034 --> 01:55:07.344
When Joe comes
uncle you give this.

01:55:08.034 --> 01:55:08.671
Okay.

01:55:09.134 --> 01:55:14.140
Give my house number also.
All that uncle will do promptly.

01:55:14.267 --> 01:55:16.008
Child you try to go fast.

01:55:16.801 --> 01:55:19.179
Nothing will happen to father.

01:55:20.067 --> 01:55:28.817
MC Movie Channel

01:55:29.134 --> 01:55:34.311
Father's death with that I was
responsible to look after entire family.

01:55:35.034 --> 01:55:36.604
The bag handed over to me by Joe...

01:55:36.767 --> 01:55:39.509
...was returned back,
that is what uncle told me.

01:55:40.267 --> 01:55:43.248
Also my house number and address.

01:55:44.567 --> 01:55:49.778
When Joe didn't call I thought.
Forgot.

01:55:51.067 --> 01:55:52.603
Or avoided.

01:55:53.401 --> 01:55:56.473
Then I didn't have
time to think anything else.

01:55:57.034 --> 01:56:02.450
House, grandma,
sister, debts created by father.

01:56:03.267 --> 01:56:05.508
That was only my life.

01:56:14.234 --> 01:56:17.408
I've prayed several times that you
shouldn't be the one who cheated me.

01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:20.240
Now it seems everything
is made to happen.

01:56:20.468 --> 01:56:23.210
As we do not desire one
single rupee of others.

01:56:23.334 --> 01:56:27.009
To steal a bank and getting
lost in a forest and to find you.

01:56:27.734 --> 01:56:30.442
And again to return back
to Buddhist monks.

01:56:30.601 --> 01:56:33.081
Everything is one...

01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:40.308
Joe police is here in search of you.

01:56:43.401 --> 01:56:44.641
My 90d.

01:56:45.101 --> 01:56:47.411
Along with those Nambiars.

01:56:51.234 --> 01:56:54.340
They have recognized you.

01:56:54.601 --> 01:56:59.983
For the time being I've diverted them.
But any moment they will return.

01:57:00.367 --> 01:57:03.439
What to do?
Buddy lets go.

01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:32.542
Like we thought, 5 Tibetans painting
is not present in any of the monasteries.

01:57:33.001 --> 01:57:35.311
Then there is no use of
staying here in particular.

01:57:35.534 --> 01:57:37.241
We also need to urgently
go, will pack and come.

01:57:37.667 --> 01:57:39.146
Take the suit case fast.

01:57:57.567 --> 01:57:59.274
No...This one.

01:57:59.567 --> 01:58:03.743
Song Pang Lama, this is the mail
send by my professor at Delhi.

01:58:04.067 --> 01:58:07.981
It was with this Lama the 5
Tibetans painting reached at last.

01:58:12.700 --> 01:58:15.476
This Lama was killed 3 years back.

01:58:18.767 --> 01:58:20.678
Along with him a saint was injured.

01:58:21.034 --> 01:58:23.105
After awakening from coma.
Transferred the information.

01:58:23.301 --> 01:58:28.046
Which is in this mail. In the art
calendar this painting is not recorded.

01:58:28.434 --> 01:58:31.711
During the Tibetan revolt
to transfer precious gems...

01:58:32.067 --> 01:58:34.308
...this painting was only a cover.

01:58:34.534 --> 01:58:37.310
Today those gems have the
claim on Chinese government.

01:58:37.534 --> 01:58:40.674
And the price of that will be
somewhat 300 crores rupees.

01:58:41.268 --> 01:58:44.579
The person who finds that and
returns Chinese government.

01:58:44.767 --> 01:58:46.713
Has declared 10% of that as reward.

01:58:46.801 --> 01:58:48.678
Which is 30 crores of rupees.

Where is he?
At home.

01:59:15.767 --> 01:59:19.214
After father's death thinking
we'll ask money never used to call.

Where is his house?

01:59:35.134 --> 01:59:37.546
Come before catching.

01:59:38.734 --> 01:59:42.079
Man, when that Nam biars are
staying there how to take vehicle.

01:59:42.234 --> 01:59:44.771

Because of that slept. Sorry child.

No. - Get out fellow!

02:00:26.434 --> 02:00:30.075
One cloth is lying here.
It stinks burning the hair in nose!

02:00:30.334 --> 02:00:32.575

stinking blanket? - That's his.

Go, go.

Car, comfort of sitting on a bull-o-cart
and sound of a helicopter.

02:00:44.067 --> 02:00:47.446
Keep quite.
I'm not talking, its the sound of engine.

02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:12.776
We need to find him
the painting is with him.

02:01:13.101 --> 02:01:14.671
He'll out beat us.

02:01:15.034 --> 02:01:18.447
He threatened Lama and
possessed the painting and fled.

02:01:18.634 --> 02:01:23.310
He was running a travel agency
there. His house is in Wayanad.

02:01:23.467 --> 02:01:25.413
So we have to go to Wayanad, no?

02:01:34.100 --> 02:01:36.603

02:01:37.034 --> 02:01:41.073
Peter send him off. - what is this?
Did the lorry of Malayali's turn over'?

02:02:33.034 --> 02:02:37.244
Sir can I simply show like that?
For that there are some procedures.

02:02:37.367 --> 02:02:40.280
Moideen, will arrange everything
you just cooperate.

02:02:40.434 --> 02:02:42.072
Okay will cooperate.

02:02:45.034 --> 02:02:47.310
Sister apply the brake now itself.

02:02:50.034 --> 02:02:51.308
Open.

02:02:51.434 --> 02:02:52.344
Reached the place?

02:02:55.367 --> 02:02:56.573
Lock, lock, look.

02:02:56.767 --> 02:03:00.112
No natives to break this.
To cut this is it a jack fruit?

02:03:01.801 --> 02:03:04.179
Why doesn't this open?
Some times its like that.

02:03:04.434 --> 02:03:06.607
Which is that time?
For us it always the good time.

02:03:07.001 --> 02:03:08.742
Is this a car or...?

02:03:09.634 --> 02:03:12.080
My sister?
Is it wielded and kept?

02:03:13.334 --> 02:03:15.575
Just push brother.
What is this back of a wild pig?

02:03:15.734 --> 02:03:18.180
Did the president travel in this car?
Why this much doubt?

02:03:18.267 --> 02:03:20.474
While he was sleeping might have
taken him into this! My god!

02:03:20.601 --> 02:03:24.071
Salman be careful while falling.
Hold, come. - God.

02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:28.138
Open this and give.
What is this? Can't open this.

02:03:28.301 --> 02:03:30.042
Just a small knock will do.
Don't kick.

02:03:30.434 --> 02:03:33.176
This is a car which has just come
out from company on kicking it will wear.

02:03:34.434 --> 02:03:39.975
Twist the body, bend the back
bone, head must be straight..what's this?

02:03:40.601 --> 02:03:43.582
<i>A swing.
My gad. Hand, my gad.</i>

02:03:43.768 --> 02:03:48.239
Come here, I'll take him out.
Not to that side, to here.

02:03:48.367 --> 02:03:51.041
Tell to where?
What is this unloading wood?

02:03:54.434 --> 02:03:57.574
I need all this again.
He should be brought in a lorry, no?

02:03:58.400 --> 02:04:02.007
Don't close should return.
Let the door be open.

02:04:02.467 --> 02:04:05.277
My back only good part in
body, now that's also gone.

02:04:05.434 --> 02:04:07.380
Don't close child.

02:04:07.501 --> 02:04:09.310
Whose back bone is this?
Let it be here.

02:04:45.601 --> 02:04:50.601
MC Movie Channel

02:05:30.767 --> 02:05:36.046
What is it? Why at this time?
I want to see Devayani. - She has left.

02:05:38.700 --> 02:05:40.976
She is a cheat.

02:05:42.467 --> 02:05:44.708
Any phone number or something?
Can give as much as numbers...

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:48.447
...as phone numbers but
can't access her on any.

02:06:00.167 --> 02:06:06.243
Child did the mistake to you. Lured
on that notes seen inside the bag.

02:06:07.001 --> 02:06:11.108
That is what took me to this level.
On returning with that money.

02:06:11.267 --> 02:06:15.443
The very next day I fell.
God's punishment.

02:06:17.467 --> 02:06:21.279
If sir has come to
ask that money in return.

02:06:22.367 --> 02:06:24.472
At present over here...
We don't want that.

02:06:25.067 --> 02:06:26.478
Anything else in bag?

02:06:27.434 --> 02:06:31.280
Some old paper and in
the middle of that, that money.

02:06:31.534 --> 02:06:33.377
Nothing else.

02:06:34.234 --> 02:06:36.236
The hope which was
there is also gone.

02:06:36.334 --> 02:06:42.114
That bag which ruined my life, later
at some other time she burned it.

02:06:42.234 --> 02:06:43.679
My heavens!

02:06:44.367 --> 02:06:49.544
Then inside that, there
was an old Tibetan blanket.

02:06:54.200 --> 02:07:00.412
From Mysore the medicine was
brought, couldn't repay money...

02:07:00.567 --> 02:07:05.573
...to Moideen he took that and left.
After that he was wearing that.

02:07:53.701 --> 02:07:55.237
You rascal!

02:07:56.100 --> 02:07:58.512
Do I know this is that one?

02:08:00.300 --> 02:08:04.214
Don't bite.
Okay sir thanks, come.

02:08:04.301 --> 02:08:07.282
We'll go and come.

02:08:07.467 --> 02:08:10.209
Not violence you
embark on non violence method.

02:08:10.600 --> 02:08:12.409
Why harming me?
My god.

02:08:12.568 --> 02:08:15.071
Meera madam.
This side seat is mine okay.

02:08:15.200 --> 02:08:17.612
Hello madam.
Is Joe near?

02:08:17.767 --> 02:08:20.373
Yes he is there will
give, Joe Meera madam.

02:08:20.501 --> 02:08:23.243
Should carry in a container.
Only told to push.

02:08:26.267 --> 02:08:27.211
What happened?

02:08:27.767 --> 02:08:30.976
Over here the Tibetan boy
who came for room service.

02:08:31.134 --> 02:08:34.377
On seeing the photo
of five Tibetans in my laptop.

02:08:35.034 --> 02:08:37.014
Brought few Lama's
and came to my room.

02:08:37.134 --> 02:08:38.579
They are saying something.

02:08:41.434 --> 02:08:44.244
We 3 have been
locked up in the room.

02:08:46.268 --> 02:08:49.738
Nothing Meera say something
to them and adjust we are on...

02:08:50.034 --> 02:08:52.014
...a more serious issue.

02:08:52.501 --> 02:08:54.481
We'll reach there.
What man?

02:08:54.601 --> 02:08:57.582
That Meera Maman is locked up in
the room by some Tibetan people.

02:08:57.701 --> 02:08:59.977
Let them be there, you get in.
Thatsit

02:09:00.100 --> 02:09:02.102
Turn off this phone and keep.
Neither going to turn off the phone.

02:09:02.200 --> 02:09:04.146
Or going to move
this vehicle from here.

02:09:04.267 --> 02:09:06.406
Which means?
I brought them here.

02:09:06.500 --> 02:09:10.471
Thinking that let anything happen
to them I can't run after that painting.

02:09:11.067 --> 02:09:16.380
What is this man? - Devu is 30 Iakhs
or Meera Maman which is big?

02:09:17.067 --> 02:09:17.772
Both!

02:09:18.101 --> 02:09:20.274
As she has got contact in
government over here.

02:09:20.434 --> 02:09:25.474
By putting her in ill-feel, do you think you
can collect 30 crores from Chinese govt?

02:09:30.167 --> 02:09:32.579
Joe call her and tell we are coming.

02:09:35.434 --> 02:09:37.505
Call.
Won't allow.

02:09:42.034 --> 02:09:45.777
No one will say this is a car, will
say either an eagle or vulture.

02:09:46.167 --> 02:09:49.444
Sister if there is brake, press.
I'm pressing, it must stop, no?

02:09:53.234 --> 02:09:56.681
Don't close.
How to open it?

02:09:58.134 --> 02:10:00.273
We'll return only
with marijuana Moideen.

02:10:00.467 --> 02:10:02.413
We will deal Meera's issue, come.

02:10:12.134 --> 02:10:13.238
Where is she gone?

02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:15.474
What hiding and scaring?

02:10:29.367 --> 02:10:31.643
Seems snow is high this time.

02:10:35.468 --> 02:10:40.468
MC Movie Channel

02:10:52.101 --> 02:10:53.375
What happened?
Do you know him?

02:10:53.500 --> 02:10:55.605
I know...l Know.

02:10:55.767 --> 02:10:57.474
He is a dangerous man.

02:10:58.167 --> 02:11:01.705
Tomorrow if I die he
will be the reason for that.

02:11:03.234 --> 02:11:04.304
Why killing you?

02:11:04.434 --> 02:11:10.749
Now I can't tell when
the time comes I'll tell.

02:12:55.801 --> 02:12:58.782
Saying that blanket is
brought from China no?

02:12:59.134 --> 02:13:03.708
Not blanket painting. - Whatever it is
since its from China, I don't trust.

02:13:04.034 --> 02:13:07.243
Why is that?
On taking anything the rate is 69.

02:13:07.334 --> 02:13:11.407
That is for house hold items it is an
old painting worth of 300 crores.

02:13:11.567 --> 02:13:14.104
If old things fetch good
price there is a grandma at home.

02:13:14.300 --> 02:13:16.177
Could sell that one. - On selling
that will get only nuts, no?

02:13:16.334 --> 02:13:18.439
At least can eat that one is it?

02:13:19.201 --> 02:13:21.579
Man its them is it?

02:13:22.067 --> 02:13:26.516
You come.

02:13:26.667 --> 02:13:27.975
What happened?

02:13:28.167 --> 02:13:31.410
Meera mam called and said
you all are locked up in the room.

02:13:32.600 --> 02:13:34.978
Wait.
Locked up in the room?

02:13:35.101 --> 02:13:38.207
Who? Meera mam has
seen us coming here.

02:13:38.401 --> 02:13:41.974
Man there is something wrong
in this. - Take all this and come.

02:13:42.134 --> 02:13:44.171
What's the matter?
Will tell, come, come.

02:13:46.167 --> 02:13:48.272
I don't want to kill you.

02:13:48.434 --> 02:13:53.782
Give that painting to
me, I'll go if not...

02:13:54.067 --> 02:13:56.547
My sir give that money to
me so that I can go.

02:13:56.701 --> 02:13:57.577
He and his gun.

02:13:57.734 --> 02:14:01.307
Where to go man? On showing
us this urgency was not seen.

02:14:01.434 --> 02:14:03.107
Why so hurry? We'll go together.

02:14:03.268 --> 02:14:05.270
Leave from my body the
cheap, bald headed one.

02:14:05.434 --> 02:14:07.778
Mr. Williams I'm an ordinary person.

02:14:08.134 --> 02:14:12.207
I had only this much on giving this
painting to Chinese government.

02:14:12.300 --> 02:14:14.337
And collect 10% commission.

02:14:14.534 --> 02:14:17.071
But now like you an
international smuggler.

02:14:17.267 --> 02:14:22.080
As entered into this game,
so my desire also increased.

02:15:07.400 --> 02:15:11.246
Going?
Tutor this man.

02:15:15.567 --> 02:15:19.572

02:15:52.234 --> 02:15:54.578

02:15:57.767 --> 02:15:59.303
I like to shock like this.

02:16:00.067 --> 02:16:03.514
Especially beautiful girls.

02:16:06.267 --> 02:16:10.682
Like a tempest. Loving like
waves haven't you heard?

02:16:10.801 --> 02:16:15.716
While seeing Meera, a
flare up from my navel.

02:16:16.100 --> 02:16:17.340
A tremor!

02:16:20.234 --> 02:16:26.742
Have you closed the door'?
I never expected Meera is this fast.

02:16:27.234 --> 02:16:29.680
On the first day itself.

02:16:33.401 --> 02:16:35.312

Who are you?

02:16:54.234 --> 02:16:55.736

Meera, who is he?

02:17:14.734 --> 02:17:16.975
What man?
Can't you hear?

02:17:17.734 --> 02:17:19.008

02:17:19.700 --> 02:17:20.735
Poor fellow!

Come out, come out.

02:17:48.001 --> 02:17:49.343
Hold me tight and come.

02:18:08.367 --> 02:18:11.314

No your intention won't work.

02:18:27.566 --> 02:18:29.102
Don't run.

02:18:33.700 --> 02:18:37.581
Man long back one guy from my
native ran after me with this intention.

02:18:37.734 --> 02:18:40.441
Even he couldn't do it
then how you people?

Understood, you bald it has
been 30 years since this Moideen...

02:19:40.100 --> 02:19:41.010
...came to Benjapura.

02:19:41.267 --> 02:19:42.712
Moideen has lived
by selling marijuana.

02:19:43.066 --> 02:19:46.048
Never sold respect and lived.
And never is going to live again.

02:19:46.200 --> 02:19:49.341
Hey bald when you pricked me
first, I understood your mind.

02:19:49.534 --> 02:19:52.481
If you want anything like that
I'll arrange another set up.

02:19:52.667 --> 02:19:55.511
What is use of catching me who
doesn't bath and clean?

02:19:55.701 --> 02:19:58.739
To dishonor Malayali's name.
What is he saying?

02:19:59.134 --> 02:20:01.740
At the right time I understood the
matter so that I could save my respect.

02:20:07.167 --> 02:20:09.977
Don't catch.
Remove it.

02:20:10.167 --> 02:20:13.011
From back I'll remove
from the front you remove.

02:20:13.534 --> 02:20:16.242
Knee is transplanted, man.

02:20:18.433 --> 02:20:19.605

02:20:21.800 --> 02:20:22.778

Got it.
Hey man Joe.

02:20:24.734 --> 02:20:26.736
Your wish won't fulfill, fellows.

02:20:27.134 --> 02:20:28.477
Don't catch on the zip.

02:20:28.667 --> 02:20:29.737
Pull it!

02:21:09.667 --> 02:21:10.771
Ho! Got it!

02:21:20.233 --> 02:21:22.577
Chakara!
No need. - Will never forget.

02:21:27.001 --> 02:21:29.641
We'll come with a gift.

02:21:32.300 --> 02:21:33.711
Shall we go?

02:21:38.400 --> 02:21:40.676
Was it for this stinking blanket?

02:21:42.600 --> 02:21:44.602
If I get them in my hands.

02:21:45.600 --> 02:21:47.011
Look got it.

02:21:47.734 --> 02:21:50.510
Hide here, if they see us they
will again escape. - That's true.

02:21:50.734 --> 02:21:52.236
Whatever happens.

02:21:54.267 --> 02:21:57.407
That' Devu who went, no?
No. - Yes that's Devu you come.

02:21:59.767 --> 02:22:02.577
My wife was by him...
Today I'll kill him.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:04.411
Break his head.

02:22:06.534 --> 02:22:09.743
On someone's head coconut fell.
The person got changed.

02:22:11.734 --> 02:22:14.078
Who is he man?
I don't know.

02:22:14.433 --> 02:22:16.413
Whoever it is thinks he is dead.

02:22:17.100 --> 02:22:18.443
Escape, come!

02:22:18.667 --> 02:22:20.772
Inside the hotel how
can the coconut fall?

02:22:22.501 --> 02:22:25.311
Look man a headless fellow.
That's true.

02:22:26.433 --> 02:22:28.470
Did the cat bite it and left?

02:22:31.234 --> 02:22:32.770
Man head is there.
Is there breath? -Yes.

02:22:33.367 --> 02:22:35.608
Some big man.
How do you know that?

02:22:35.767 --> 02:22:37.747
On lying can know, is it?

02:22:38.067 --> 02:22:40.570
He is the guy who said sorry and
went, no? May be epilepsy.

02:22:40.734 --> 02:22:44.238
Yes that's why with an iron gun,
you take that gun and give it in his hand.

02:22:45.067 --> 02:22:47.069
Then hold we will
take him to hospital.

02:22:47.767 --> 02:22:49.508
Hold.
careful.

02:22:50.534 --> 02:22:53.777
What are you doing? Turn
back and hold. - How? - Like this.

02:22:54.133 --> 02:22:56.704
What is this man?
as if drying a bed sheet.

02:22:57.067 --> 02:23:00.514
Human being, no? I'll take, lift.

02:23:01.200 --> 02:23:04.647
How heavy? Is he eating
concrete steel?

02:23:05.334 --> 02:23:08.406
You don't stand there, come here.
Did the mind return?

02:23:08.600 --> 02:23:11.274
Just rub where it was hit.
Will it bulge?

02:23:11.434 --> 02:23:13.971
You rat, rub on his head.

02:23:14.134 --> 02:23:17.377
Lucky there is life if taken fast can
put in a mortuary before it closes.

02:23:17.700 --> 02:23:20.237
Are you sure this is that blanket?
Don't twist black tongue.

02:23:26.767 --> 02:23:29.077
Whom are you calling man?
Him only.

02:23:29.267 --> 02:23:31.338
If anything in this is
his name he'll answer.

02:23:31.534 --> 02:23:33.980
Then its easy to write his
name at the hospital, no?

02:23:34.134 --> 02:23:36.512
Where were you? That
Meera Maman is quite okay.

02:23:36.701 --> 02:23:39.443
What is this?
This is a poor man. Had an epilepsy.

02:23:39.567 --> 02:23:41.547
Was lying on the floor
should take him to hospital.

02:23:41.734 --> 02:23:44.146
If delayed it will become a problem
and life can be in danger.

02:23:44.267 --> 02:23:46.144
Leave that did you get Moideen?
Got the blanket.

02:23:46.367 --> 02:23:48.643
Open the eyes and see, son.
Got the blanket.

02:23:51.733 --> 02:23:54.577
What is sifs name?
We only saved you.

02:23:57.567 --> 02:24:04.416
Sir doesn't need to go to hospital.
Knock on head.

02:24:08.267 --> 02:24:10.645
When you got crores
you became enticed, no?

02:24:11.400 --> 02:24:14.472
I never expected this from you.
Should have a soul.

02:24:15.200 --> 02:24:16.474
Then take this soul!

02:24:17.134 --> 02:24:19.410
God.
Has carried and come.

02:24:19.567 --> 02:24:21.569
He is the one who killed Lama.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:25.174
This person!
Throw that fellow!

02:24:25.467 --> 02:24:28.414
Before anyone seens
put him in the car.

02:24:34.067 --> 02:24:36.343
If a cross is obtained can nail him.

02:24:36.467 --> 02:24:39.414
Open the dickey.
If inside the dickey, he'll escape.

02:24:40.067 --> 02:24:42.013
Fold 4 times and keep it inside car.

02:24:42.200 --> 02:24:45.477
Only if the door opens can he
escape? push and put him in.

02:24:50.600 --> 02:24:53.012
Is this the painting of 300 crores?

02:24:53.800 --> 02:24:55.780
You be cool. Let me check.

02:24:57.600 --> 02:24:59.580
Joe do we have to
check this here itself?

02:25:00.033 --> 02:25:02.343
People will notice, no?

02:25:02.467 --> 02:25:04.413
First should know whether its the
same thing which we intended.

02:25:04.567 --> 02:25:06.103
No need to carry this burden if not.

02:25:06.301 --> 02:25:09.282
If its not in this, surrender to police
then the things are easy, no?

02:25:09.500 --> 02:25:11.411
Will it be there.
Shut up man.

02:25:11.700 --> 02:25:13.543
You check whether there
is any stitch over there?

02:25:13.734 --> 02:25:15.577
One is there over
here, totally stitched.

02:25:16.567 --> 02:25:17.568
Pull it!

02:25:24.467 --> 02:25:29.467
MC Movie Channel

02:26:14.633 --> 02:26:18.171
See all this as a part of a big play.

02:26:18.401 --> 02:26:23.749
A master plan. A play that this
universe is making you to play.

02:26:50.334 --> 02:26:55.334
MC Movie Channel

02:27:01.133 --> 02:27:02.305
Sir get up sir.

02:27:13.100 --> 02:27:15.376
Didn't I die? - No sir.
Why was that?

02:27:15.534 --> 02:27:19.175
We all saved sir. Otherwise
might have died.

02:27:19.367 --> 02:27:20.573
Who are this we?

02:27:20.800 --> 02:27:23.440
That is, me, him and him and tutor.

02:27:25.100 --> 02:27:27.637
Can't see anything, what
was there has it also gone?

02:27:28.100 --> 02:27:30.137
Where is my glass?
Will give the glass.

02:27:30.334 --> 02:27:32.007
Good giving the glass
and all will it a problem?

02:27:32.134 --> 02:27:33.374
Here sir.

02:27:57.067 --> 02:28:00.014
I want to catch you.
No nothing at all.

02:28:00.234 --> 02:28:01.440
Should give 5 minutes for us.
For what?

02:28:01.601 --> 02:28:03.740
Patiently hear what we've to say.
I don't want to hear.

02:28:06.200 --> 02:28:08.077
That a nuisance is this?

02:28:17.133 --> 02:28:21.513
Did it out of hardship we very
well know its not an excuse.

02:28:21.634 --> 02:28:24.410
But a chance for all to escape.

02:28:24.600 --> 02:28:26.102
If sir catches us and gives...

02:28:26.267 --> 02:28:28.747
...maximum what you get is
a two line news on paper.

02:28:29.067 --> 02:28:33.015
Ora pat on shoulder. Then when
truly saying what sir has got...

02:28:33.201 --> 02:28:37.172
...against us is that only sketch
which that tea seller has drawn.

02:28:37.734 --> 02:28:42.308
More than we have drunk a tea from
there it can't be taken as solid proof.

02:28:42.534 --> 02:28:44.480
Sir also very well knows that.

02:28:44.634 --> 02:28:46.375
Looking man.
Now you go.

02:28:46.634 --> 02:28:47.704
Catch the leg.

02:28:48.167 --> 02:28:50.044
Today if sir stays with us...

02:28:50.167 --> 02:28:54.513
...to sir we will not only be
exchanging an international criminal.

02:28:54.700 --> 02:28:59.206
That crores which Chinese
government gives, there will a share of it.

02:29:01.801 --> 02:29:04.042
No, not possible.

02:29:04.234 --> 02:29:08.376
On the day when bank robbery took
place we can tell where ever you want.

02:29:08.467 --> 02:29:11.141
That they were with us.

02:29:11.367 --> 02:29:13.608
Yea, they will say.

02:29:17.034 --> 02:29:21.414
To help sir there is government
to help us there is only sir.

02:29:22.167 --> 02:29:24.010
True in the name of sir.

02:29:27.167 --> 02:29:30.580
When there is severe pain
he will cry like anything.

02:29:31.234 --> 02:29:35.273
Sir, not yet finished the desire to live.

02:29:35.434 --> 02:29:42.147
MBRHDRG

02:29:42.301 --> 02:29:46.078
Sir did you see now
you should decide.

02:29:46.300 --> 02:29:50.510
Whether to end the life of 3
young men or wants crores.

02:29:50.700 --> 02:29:53.374
3 young men? Then what
about me? - This one also.

02:29:58.767 --> 02:30:00.508
Don't confuse me like this?

02:30:00.667 --> 02:30:05.377
Not luring on the crores
I get on this as commission.

02:30:05.600 --> 02:30:10.549
But with you, the future of this
country is in the hands of youth.

02:30:10.734 --> 02:30:13.738
Yes, that is true.
Only thinking on that.

02:30:14.767 --> 02:30:18.237
What you say I'm accepting
it half mindedly.

02:30:19.200 --> 02:30:21.237
Don't hurt the body.

02:30:23.433 --> 02:30:26.346
What you say will that Chinese
people give that much money?

02:30:26.567 --> 02:30:31.414
Will give. - Don't fool me okay.
If we fool sir, we'll be jailed, no?

02:30:31.600 --> 02:30:36.049
How come sir is a fool like this?
Yea man, after getting that hit on head.

02:30:36.167 --> 02:30:38.408
I also feel something is wrong.

02:30:41.300 --> 02:30:45.271
Let me deal those Nambiars.
Real misers!

02:30:48.767 --> 02:30:53.443
Hey man seeing our hardships
god has given this 30 crores.

02:30:54.034 --> 02:30:55.980
We are going to rock now!
Yes.

02:30:56.267 --> 02:30:58.213
We will rock man.

02:30:58.567 --> 02:31:00.774
Are you beating on the cheeks?
You bandicoot rat!

02:31:01.100 --> 02:31:02.738
Bendicoot rat is your father!

02:31:03.067 --> 02:31:04.978
Its okay, okay.

02:31:05.267 --> 02:31:08.339
That lizard Shashi is your father!
Will you beat me?

02:31:08.600 --> 02:31:11.706
My head.
I'll kill you man.

02:31:12.100 --> 02:31:14.546
Go man.
Here, water.

02:31:14.734 --> 02:31:18.204
I'll bath you and you lie here.

02:31:18.734 --> 02:31:21.715
Don't bite on the ears.

02:31:30.734 --> 02:31:33.214
Man all have left lets go.

02:31:34.101 --> 02:31:35.079
Come.

02:31:36.534 --> 02:31:38.411
Why did you first
beat on my cheeks?

02:31:38.567 --> 02:31:40.740
That is why I started the beating.

02:31:41.067 --> 02:31:44.514
Did by mistake.
Are your parents keeping fine?

02:31:44.667 --> 02:31:48.080
Fine. - For the festival bring
your parents to my home.

02:31:48.267 --> 02:31:51.407
Will come. - Should come to
my house also with mother.

02:31:51.534 --> 02:31:52.672
Will come.

02:31:58.600 --> 02:32:00.637
One minute okay.
Again on the way.

02:32:04.434 --> 02:32:06.607
Again on the way.
This will be ready now.

02:32:07.634 --> 02:32:11.104
Coming home late at night drunk.

02:32:11.367 --> 02:32:16.248
Just to kick with legs and to cuddle
under the blanket on rainy nights.

02:32:16.401 --> 02:32:22.044
To bear the kids and one day when
bank confiscates everything left.

02:32:22.234 --> 02:32:24.578
To cry beating the chest.

02:32:24.767 --> 02:32:27.043
He wants a girl.

02:32:31.301 --> 02:32:34.305
If its okay get in.
