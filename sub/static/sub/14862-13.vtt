00:03.741 --> 00:06.051
<i>Previously on "Mistresses"...</i>

00:06.052 --> 00:07.558
That was amazing.

00:07.559 --> 00:09.760
Was that amazing or has
it just been so long?

00:09.761 --> 00:11.269
No. That was amazing.

00:11.270 --> 00:14.881
I saw Paul. I just saw my dead husband.

00:14.882 --> 00:15.775
Hi, April.

00:15.776 --> 00:17.768
- I want a second chance.
- You committed fraud.

00:17.769 --> 00:19.270
Well, I'll turn myself in.

00:19.271 --> 00:24.971
I wanna be with my wife and
my little girl, who I love.

00:26.844 --> 00:29.613
I'm pregnant, Harry, but
it might not be yours.

00:29.614 --> 00:33.183
I don't regret what happened
that night, not for a second.

00:33.184 --> 00:35.819
If the baby isn't mine,
you have a choice to make...

00:35.820 --> 00:38.322
Me or the baby.

00:38.323 --> 00:41.080

02:09.045 --> 02:12.688

doorstep this morning.

02:12.689 --> 02:14.357
- Not from us.
- Mm?

02:14.358 --> 02:16.338
But...

02:16.360 --> 02:17.804
This is!

02:17.805 --> 02:19.733

- Ta-da!

An all-expenses paid trip
to luxurious Palm Springs!

02:25.657 --> 02:27.511
Just us girls and a T-Bird.

02:27.512 --> 02:29.098
We road trip tomorrow.

02:29.099 --> 02:32.420
This is so sweet, you guys. Wait. So...

02:32.421 --> 02:34.714
None of you sent me flowers?

02:34.715 --> 02:37.928
Um, we just got you a trip, Sav.

02:37.929 --> 02:41.652
No. I love the trip. Thank
you so much for this, really.

02:41.653 --> 02:43.039
Someone sent you a bouquet?

02:43.040 --> 02:45.449
Yeah, and the card
read "Happy Birthday".

02:45.450 --> 02:47.314
No sender and no florist.

02:47.315 --> 02:49.206
It's obviously from Dom.
That sneaky little...

02:49.207 --> 02:50.666
- Joss.
- What?

02:50.667 --> 02:53.602
- I wouldn't be too sure of that.
- Well, they could be from Harry.

02:53.603 --> 02:56.938
Do you think he had a sudden
change of heart for some reason?

02:56.939 --> 02:59.441
Let's, uh, cut the cake.

02:59.442 --> 03:02.059
The important question is, who
do you want them to be from?

03:02.060 --> 03:03.101
I really don't know.

03:03.102 --> 03:06.246
Oh, come on. You must've had
a wish or a flash of a feeling.

03:06.247 --> 03:09.688
I have flashes of feelings all
the time about both of them.

03:09.689 --> 03:13.886
But I certainly can't trust myself
to choose which sliding door.

03:13.887 --> 03:16.191
- Why?
- Because I'm a lunatic.

03:16.192 --> 03:19.974
The other night, I was so
sure that I wanted to kiss Dom.

03:19.975 --> 03:23.552
And then I did kiss Dom, and
I found myself pulling away.

03:23.553 --> 03:24.668
- You kissed Dom?
- What?

03:24.669 --> 03:27.011
Yeah. Yeah. Uh...

03:27.012 --> 03:29.351
April, your horror?

03:29.352 --> 03:33.036
I... Uh, see your
inappropriate kiss with Dom.

03:33.037 --> 03:38.145
And I raise you one
scandalous make out with Paul.

03:38.146 --> 03:39.953
- What?!
- Oh, my God.

03:39.954 --> 03:43.492
- When?! What is going on?
- I didn't plan it. Believe me. But...

03:43.493 --> 03:48.423
I can't deny how it felt,
smelt, tasted like...

03:48.424 --> 03:51.635
The happiness of my past.

03:51.636 --> 03:55.296
Look. Of course I was conflicted. I
ran out of there as fast as I could.

03:55.297 --> 03:58.311
But the longer Paul is around, the
more vivid the old Paul becomes...

03:58.312 --> 04:01.626
- The Paul I knew for 17 years.
- And the Paul from the last three?

04:01.627 --> 04:05.676
He did a terrible thing, an unspeakable
thing, but he is willing to face it.

04:05.677 --> 04:09.023
- To go to jail to make things right.
- And where does that leave Richard?

04:09.024 --> 04:11.437
Richard is a great boyfriend.

04:11.438 --> 04:14.434
He's a terrific father to
Madi. He makes me laugh.

04:14.435 --> 04:15.487
So what's the problem?

04:15.488 --> 04:17.946
It just quite feel
like it does with Paul.

04:17.947 --> 04:21.390
Like battered wife syndrome?

04:21.391 --> 04:23.492
- Did I just say that out loud?
- Mm hmm.

04:23.493 --> 04:28.039
Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's just that's how it seems.

04:28.040 --> 04:31.787
I mean, Paul made your life and Lucy's
life a living hell for three years.

04:31.788 --> 04:34.235
You know, I can't even believe
you'd consider taking him back.

04:34.236 --> 04:36.173
Yeah, the man is beyond
redemption at this point.

04:36.174 --> 04:38.726
And of course, Paul is taking
more space in your mind.

04:38.727 --> 04:44.067
It's been days since you've
even spoken to Richard.

04:44.781 --> 04:48.776
You know, every one of you has done
something you wish you hadn't done.

04:48.777 --> 04:53.805
You've each made horrible
mistakes, told despicable lies...

04:53.806 --> 04:58.812
And you've done nothing but plot and
scheme and beg for forgiveness ever since.

04:58.813 --> 05:01.982
And you stand here telling me, the
one person who hasn't hurt anyone,

05:01.983 --> 05:07.023
that I'm not allowed to
consider forgiving Paul?

05:08.000 --> 05:10.853
Well, I don't know about
you guys, but I feel dirty.

05:10.854 --> 05:13.395
I say we hit Palm Springs today,
get exfoliated or something.

05:13.396 --> 05:16.295
- I can't. I have to work.
- I have to pack Lucy for Jane's.

05:16.296 --> 05:18.789
All right. Karen?

05:18.790 --> 05:19.980
Me?

05:19.981 --> 05:23.931
I have to tie up some loose ends.

05:23.932 --> 05:28.022
So as you can see,
it's been quite a year.

05:28.023 --> 05:30.085
To say the least.

05:30.086 --> 05:33.684
Which you always do,
until I drag it out of you.

05:33.685 --> 05:37.052
You know, you could've
come to me for counsel.

05:37.053 --> 05:42.953
Can you tell me about the affair,
this man that you loved and lost?

05:45.688 --> 05:48.868
His name was Tom Grey.

05:48.903 --> 05:50.455
Oh.

05:50.456 --> 05:51.548
- What?
- What?

05:51.549 --> 05:54.718
- Your reaction.
- What? I... I didn't...

05:54.719 --> 05:56.759
I did?

05:57.705 --> 06:00.283
I can't get anything past you.

06:00.284 --> 06:03.326
Yeah, Thomas Grey, the trial lawyer?

06:03.327 --> 06:07.037
- Yes. Did you know him?
- Yeah. Married to Elizabeth?

06:07.038 --> 06:10.259
- How did you...
- I used to see him here in the halls.

06:10.260 --> 06:11.562
He was...

06:11.563 --> 06:13.948
Practically a resident
on the psychiatric floor.

06:13.949 --> 06:16.234
What? Tom was institutionalized?

06:16.235 --> 06:19.295
No, it was his wife.

06:19.968 --> 06:22.386
I'm surprised he never
shared that with you.

06:22.387 --> 06:24.922
But Elizabeth told me
she'd never seen a shrink.

06:24.923 --> 06:30.023
Well, she didn't. She
saw a whole team of them.

06:38.584 --> 06:42.184
What the hell are you doing?

06:42.485 --> 06:44.850
Where did this come from?

06:44.851 --> 06:46.531
You steal it from your father?

06:46.532 --> 06:49.777
No, I didn't steal it. I took it myself.

06:49.778 --> 06:51.698
When?

06:52.043 --> 06:55.581
When did you have occasion
to take candids of Dr. Kim?

06:55.582 --> 06:57.586
We were friends, all right?

06:57.587 --> 06:59.515
When did this begin?

06:59.516 --> 07:04.060
During your father's affair
with her or after she killed him?

07:04.061 --> 07:05.928
You're delusional. You know that?

07:05.929 --> 07:08.304
- I'm delusional?
- Let's talk about this when you're sober.

07:08.305 --> 07:11.305
How's Tuesday sound?

07:11.822 --> 07:14.364
Don't you talk to me that way.

07:14.365 --> 07:15.903
Yeah, go.

07:15.904 --> 07:18.708
Cower. Walk away, just like your father!

07:18.709 --> 07:21.102
Just like him. That's right.

07:21.103 --> 07:24.736
Lonely, shut out, living with a
woman who's forbidding and cold.

07:24.737 --> 07:28.981
You drove him to Karen,
just like you drove me.

07:28.982 --> 07:32.415
She came to me. You know that.

07:32.416 --> 07:35.192
You never asked me why.

07:35.193 --> 07:38.776
She was concerned that
you were in love with her.

07:38.777 --> 07:41.498
Embarrassed for you, really.

07:41.499 --> 07:44.035
To her, you were nothing more than a...

07:44.036 --> 07:47.624
Pathetic child with a misguided crush.

07:47.625 --> 07:49.543
Yeah?

07:49.544 --> 07:53.384
Then why did she sleep with me?

08:01.232 --> 08:03.018
So he's gonna come in later? Okay.

08:03.019 --> 08:05.193
Tell you what. Just make
sure he gets this, all right?

08:05.194 --> 08:06.407
Thank you.

08:06.408 --> 08:08.999
- Happy Birthday, Savannah.
- Hey.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.767
I told you not to make a
big deal of my birthday.

08:11.768 --> 08:13.044
Is "Happy Birthday" a big deal?

08:13.045 --> 08:16.085
From the partners, Mrs. D. You're
officially a member of cheese of the month.

08:16.086 --> 08:19.841
- See, that's a big deal.
- No, that's a big wheel.

08:19.842 --> 08:21.842
Just keep it behind your desk.

08:21.843 --> 08:24.041
- Got a meeting.
- That's it?

08:24.042 --> 08:25.561
Best wishes?

08:25.562 --> 08:27.362
Oh.

08:30.249 --> 08:33.849
- Hi.
- Uh, hey. Yeah, um...

08:34.331 --> 08:37.269
I'm just calling to, uh...

08:37.270 --> 08:40.727
Well, first of all, Happy Birthday.

08:40.727 --> 08:42.796
Thank you.

08:42.797 --> 08:45.838
Listen, I left you something
at the house. Did you get it?

08:45.839 --> 08:47.020
They were from you.

08:47.021 --> 08:50.689
Well, who else would be
handling our personal bills?

08:50.690 --> 08:53.176
Uh, oh. Uh...

08:53.177 --> 08:55.924
Yeah. I mean, our bills
are our bills, right?

08:55.925 --> 09:00.419
Yeah. I, um, I forwarded the utilities
and the other big stuff to me, but...

09:00.420 --> 09:03.993
There were some statements from your O.B.
that I probably shouldn't be handling.

09:03.994 --> 09:05.142
Okay.

09:05.143 --> 09:08.791
Yeah, there was a-a $600 bill for a
single visit, does that sound right?

09:08.792 --> 09:12.410
Yes. Uh, that was for the ultrasound.

09:12.411 --> 09:14.331
So...

09:14.337 --> 09:17.064
Okay. Good. Well, I'll...
I'll go ahead and pay that.

09:17.065 --> 09:18.985
Um...

09:19.066 --> 09:22.777
Look, I hate to talk about this
on your birthday, Sav, but...

09:22.778 --> 09:26.750
It might be better if you handle
your medical stuff yourself.

09:26.751 --> 09:29.045
Right. Sure.

09:29.046 --> 09:30.095
Much better.

09:30.096 --> 09:32.099
Okay, well...

09:32.100 --> 09:34.680
Happy Birthday.

09:45.046 --> 09:46.867

10:28.129 --> 10:30.891
Sourpuss down at reception
to free up an adjoining suite?

10:30.892 --> 10:34.009
My sister likes to be close to her
girls, especially around bedtime.

10:34.010 --> 10:35.485
Mm.

10:35.486 --> 10:39.572
Well, such a beautiful creature
deserves to have the weekend she wants.

10:39.573 --> 10:43.169
Oh, good. Because she's preggers
and it's gonna be a big birthday.

10:43.170 --> 10:44.477
It's not that big of a birthday.

10:44.478 --> 10:46.336
Are you kidding? Last
birthday without a kid.

10:46.337 --> 10:48.504
Do you have any idea how
hard her life's about to get?

10:48.505 --> 10:51.489
Excuse me. But this old lady's
gotta waddle off to the loo.

10:51.490 --> 10:52.891
That'll be all for now, Brendon.

10:52.892 --> 10:56.230

- Mm hmm. Thank you. Mm.

- Savi, stop.

right. You're right. Sorry.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.674
Harry, hey, it's me.
Where the hell are you?

11:05.675 --> 11:09.264
Do you realize what you're doing to
me? She trusted me with those results.

11:09.265 --> 11:11.870
Look, I know that you don't care
about your relationship with her,

11:11.871 --> 11:14.717
but can you at least
please care about mine?

11:14.718 --> 11:17.403
I'm out of town for the weekend
so I strongly suggest that

11:17.404 --> 11:23.304
that envelope end up back in the

11:57.386 --> 11:58.853
Just text me.

11:58.854 --> 12:00.714
Bye.

12:01.557 --> 12:03.524
Daddy, I can't.

12:03.525 --> 12:05.550
Come on.

12:05.551 --> 12:07.280
Come on, Izzy. Come on. Jump to daddy.

12:07.281 --> 12:09.532
Come on. It's fun. Just do a
Superman right into my arms.

12:09.533 --> 12:10.887
I don't want to, daddy.

12:10.888 --> 12:14.111
Come on, buddy. You got your
floaties on. It's okay. You're cool.

12:14.112 --> 12:15.972
I promise I'm gonna catch you.

12:15.973 --> 12:19.869
Okay? Bro, you've been
excited about this for weeks.

12:19.870 --> 12:23.012
You're my brave guy. You can
just jump right in, come on.

12:23.013 --> 12:26.313
Come on, buddy. Come on.

12:26.586 --> 12:28.020
Ready?

12:28.021 --> 12:29.599
All right!

12:29.600 --> 12:32.491
- Great job!
- Oh, look at you.

12:32.492 --> 12:34.078
That was great, Sweetie.

12:34.079 --> 12:38.039
- You did it.
- You're so brave.

12:40.753 --> 12:43.855
- Joss, wake up.
- Hmm?

12:43.856 --> 12:45.776
What?

12:46.460 --> 12:48.516
- I gotta go home.
- Huh?

12:48.517 --> 12:51.277
I gotta go home.

12:54.672 --> 12:58.867
So I went over to Richard's to remind
myself what a terrific guy he is.

12:58.868 --> 13:01.092
And guess what. He's gone.

13:01.093 --> 13:03.489
Yeah, whole place packed up, abandoned.

13:03.490 --> 13:05.958
He is pulling a Paul. Why
does this keep happening to me?

13:05.959 --> 13:10.193
- Another freaking magician...
- Hey, April.

13:10.194 --> 13:12.629
Looks like I missed a few phone calls.

13:12.630 --> 13:14.097
Um...

13:14.098 --> 13:15.886
Scratch that. I found him.

13:15.887 --> 13:17.842
Richard, where have you been?

13:17.843 --> 13:20.412
At work. I usually turn off
my phone during interviews.

13:20.413 --> 13:22.904
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

13:22.905 --> 13:27.805
And after the last few days,
I wasn't expecting you to call.

13:27.806 --> 13:30.042
Your living room was...

13:30.043 --> 13:33.238
Packed up. Your place was all
empty. I thought you had...

13:33.239 --> 13:34.315
Taken off.

13:34.316 --> 13:38.458
I just had it painted.
It was peeling like fruit.

13:38.459 --> 13:42.588
Why, after everything, would you
think I would just up and leave?

13:42.589 --> 13:46.129
It's happened to me before.

13:46.157 --> 13:48.727
April, listen to me.

13:48.728 --> 13:51.308
I'm not Paul.

13:53.834 --> 13:56.649
I know you're not.

13:56.650 --> 13:58.326
Savi, what are you
doing? What's going on?

13:58.327 --> 14:00.282
Do you have the valet
ticket I thought I had it.

14:00.283 --> 14:02.250
- But I can't find it.
- I think it's in the room.

14:02.251 --> 14:05.678
Yo. I'm not letting you leave
until you tell me what is happening.

14:05.679 --> 14:09.408
All day I've been
obsessing about the flowers.

14:09.409 --> 14:11.975
Who are they from, Dom or Harry?

14:11.976 --> 14:17.642
Thinking that my destiny would somehow be
decided by the name on that little card.

14:17.643 --> 14:19.822
And then I saw that family.

14:19.823 --> 14:20.953
What are you talking about?

14:20.954 --> 14:23.315
The family by the pool.
The little boy and the dad.

14:23.316 --> 14:25.384
Okay, so?

14:25.385 --> 14:27.161
So...

14:27.162 --> 14:31.013
Joss, this entire time, I've been
asking myself the wrong question...

14:31.014 --> 14:34.660
Who will star with me in my romance?

14:34.661 --> 14:38.155
But it's... it's not about that.

14:38.156 --> 14:40.241
It's about a...

14:40.242 --> 14:42.983
A different kind of romance.

14:42.984 --> 14:47.367
The... the romance of
a family for this baby.

14:47.368 --> 14:51.783
You know, the kind we
never had and always wanted.

14:51.784 --> 14:54.817
Well... what are you gonna do?

14:54.818 --> 14:56.919
I'm gonna go get those Genzide results.

14:56.920 --> 14:58.422
What? Right now?

14:58.423 --> 15:01.386
The baby's future depends on
the name in that envelope, okay?

15:01.387 --> 15:04.174
And I have to find out so that I
can at least try to make it work.

15:04.175 --> 15:06.130
Okay, but what about our weekend?

15:06.131 --> 15:09.924
Well, I'll just go and bring
the envelope back and open it...

15:09.925 --> 15:11.382
- With my closest friends.
- Savi...

15:11.383 --> 15:15.823
Hey, just tell me where the envelope is.

15:16.155 --> 15:18.126
Uh, it should be in my nightstand.

15:18.127 --> 15:20.467
Uh, really?

15:20.527 --> 15:24.593
Not a safe deposit box or...
Your undies drawer even?

15:24.594 --> 15:27.269
Look, I am totally with you on
this decision, but I don't love the

15:27.270 --> 15:30.775
idea of the pregnant lady driving
all the way back in the dark...

15:30.776 --> 15:33.156
Alone. All right? So just do me a favor.

15:33.157 --> 15:36.909
Sleep on it. You can always go
in the morning, it's not like...

15:36.910 --> 15:40.570
The envelope's going anywhere.

15:41.213 --> 15:43.073
Huh?

15:44.699 --> 15:47.999
- Okay. Okay.
- Perfect.

15:48.354 --> 15:52.254
- Back to the pool, hmm?
- Yeah.

16:01.207 --> 16:04.112
- I didn't expect you so early.
- I know. Sorry.

16:04.113 --> 16:07.288
Okay. How fancy are we getting?

16:07.289 --> 16:09.190
California fancy.

16:09.191 --> 16:13.462
After all these years, I still
don't know what that means.

16:13.463 --> 16:17.532
Honey, would you kill me if
I asked to drive separately?

16:17.533 --> 16:19.069
No, I'll be ready in ten minutes.

16:19.070 --> 16:21.846
No, Richard wants to
have brunch this morning.

16:21.847 --> 16:24.351
Considering the past week,
I think I'd have a better

16:24.352 --> 16:27.453
time in Palm Springs if
things were more settled.

16:27.454 --> 16:31.769
Why didn't you call me
to ask me this, April?

16:31.770 --> 16:33.690
Talk.

16:33.728 --> 16:39.401
Okay. I've been thinking about
yesterday, how defensive I was about Paul.

16:39.402 --> 16:42.004
The truth is...

16:42.005 --> 16:45.241
I'm ashamed. How could
I have feelings for him?

16:45.242 --> 16:49.645
- Depends on what they are.
- It's not hatred anymore. Not anger.

16:49.646 --> 16:52.808
- Love?
- No, not love.

16:52.809 --> 16:55.117
How can I even be thinking this?

16:55.118 --> 16:59.094
Feelings are feelings.
You can't guilt them away.

16:59.095 --> 17:01.586
Believe me. I tried that with Tom.

17:01.587 --> 17:06.038
But I couldn't deny
that he's who I wanted.

17:06.039 --> 17:07.835
What do you want?

17:07.836 --> 17:11.959
A partner, a father
for my child, a family.

17:11.960 --> 17:15.896
There's no easy answer. I mean,
Richard is an amazing guy, not a felon.

17:15.896 --> 17:17.280
- And Paul...
- Close your eyes.

17:17.281 --> 17:19.133
You can't hypnotize
me. I'm way too uptight.

17:19.134 --> 17:23.171
Just close your eyes, April. Come on.

17:23.172 --> 17:28.632
Everyone else's judgments
aside, mine, Savi's, Joss'...

17:29.130 --> 17:33.150
Who do you see a happy life with?

17:37.901 --> 17:40.301
I gotta go.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.532
Mm.

18:20.104 --> 18:21.904
Hi.

18:22.652 --> 18:25.352
This looks nice.

18:27.612 --> 18:30.972

18:34.209 --> 18:36.656

18:36.657 --> 18:39.837
I'm so sorry, Richard.

18:40.817 --> 18:44.417
<i>♪Close your eyes and dream.</i>

18:46.908 --> 18:49.368
Hello, Karen.

18:49.734 --> 18:51.752
Elizabeth, what are you doing?

18:51.753 --> 18:54.033
Look, I...

18:54.123 --> 18:56.136
I know this is awkward.

18:56.137 --> 19:02.037
- Look, Elizabeth, I'm on my way out.
- I just came to say...

19:02.713 --> 19:06.013
I'm really sorry, Karen.

19:06.671 --> 19:10.091
Just give me five minutes.

19:11.629 --> 19:12.978
Oh, come on. Come on.

19:12.979 --> 19:14.874
<i>♪Girl, you gotta wonder

19:14.875 --> 19:19.915
<i>♪Girl, you gotta wonder
about a man like that.</i>

19:21.238 --> 19:22.895
Good morning, sleepyhead.

19:22.896 --> 19:26.760
I don't have Bluetooth in this
thing, so you better make it quick.

19:26.761 --> 19:30.200
- Where exactly are you?
- I'm on the 60 near L.A.

19:30.201 --> 19:32.654
- Savi, pull off the freeway.
- What?

19:32.655 --> 19:34.980
No, I'm not pulling off the freeway.

19:34.981 --> 19:38.963
I can't tell you bad news when you're doing
80 miles an hour on the freeway. Pull off.

19:38.964 --> 19:41.154
Oh, you're serious.

19:41.155 --> 19:45.295
Okay. I'm pulling onto the shoulder.

19:51.559 --> 19:55.160
- Are you stopped yet?
- Yeah, I'm stopped.

19:55.161 --> 19:57.878
The Genzide envelope isn't there.

19:57.879 --> 20:00.144
Harry stole the results.

20:00.145 --> 20:02.186
What are you talking about?

20:02.187 --> 20:04.202
He was over the other
morning, and I was...

20:04.203 --> 20:08.852
Wasted and out of it, and he
took them when I wasn't looking.

20:08.853 --> 20:10.890
What was he even doing there?

20:10.891 --> 20:13.296
Why did you leave it out?

20:13.297 --> 20:19.197
I promise I'll explain everything to you if
you just please come back to Palm Springs.

20:20.566 --> 20:23.096
- So Harry knows.
- Maybe or...

20:23.097 --> 20:25.307
Maybe he didn't open it.

20:25.308 --> 20:29.988
Or maybe he couldn't bear
to mention it when he called.

20:29.989 --> 20:32.989
Savi, I'm so sorry.

20:33.145 --> 20:36.565
I'll see you in an hour.

20:57.195 --> 20:59.360
I just don't understand.

20:59.361 --> 21:01.593
Yesterday you were panicked
when you thought I had left.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.161
And I was.

21:03.162 --> 21:06.582
I was heartbroken and sad.

21:07.542 --> 21:10.109
But as the hours passed and...

21:10.110 --> 21:15.284
I convinced myself that you
had really left me, I felt...

21:15.285 --> 21:18.162
- What?
- Relieved.

21:18.163 --> 21:19.394
That's a crappy thing to say.

21:19.395 --> 21:22.892
Not relieved that you
were gone, Richard.

21:22.893 --> 21:26.921
Relieved that you were
the one to hurt me and...

21:26.922 --> 21:30.282
Not the other way around.

21:30.984 --> 21:33.867
So he's gotten to you, huh?

21:33.868 --> 21:35.657
I can't believe it.

21:35.658 --> 21:39.138
You're going back to Paul.

21:42.120 --> 21:44.661
I got back with my ex a bunch of times.

21:44.662 --> 21:50.166
Each time, I convinced myself
that it could be good again.

21:50.167 --> 21:54.559
Ended up just wasting
another five years of my life.

21:54.560 --> 21:57.680
People change, Richard.

21:58.165 --> 22:01.705
But they don't change back.

22:07.651 --> 22:09.511
Mom.

22:12.489 --> 22:15.969
I'm headed to the airport.

22:19.879 --> 22:25.339
Leaving for good if you
want to do a good-bye thing.

23:24.126 --> 23:25.675
Ice?

23:25.676 --> 23:27.602
No, thank you.

23:27.603 --> 23:31.083
Your home is lovely, Karen.

23:31.305 --> 23:33.345
Sparse.

23:33.605 --> 23:36.118
I mean that in a good way.

23:36.119 --> 23:39.346
Tom never could stand
knickknacks or clutter.

23:39.347 --> 23:41.314
Elizabeth, let's not.

23:41.315 --> 23:44.152
I didn't mean it that way.

23:44.153 --> 23:47.393
I have no vitriol left.

23:47.985 --> 23:51.525
It's made me sick, frankly.

23:55.859 --> 24:00.059
If I'm gonna get on with my life...

24:00.390 --> 24:04.350
I need to settle things with you.

24:05.072 --> 24:08.792
How can I help you with that?

24:11.675 --> 24:14.344
Where are you headed?

24:14.345 --> 24:18.224
Palm Springs. It's my
best friend's birthday.

24:18.225 --> 24:20.917
Actually, I'm late so I
should get on the road.

24:20.918 --> 24:26.618
I know I should let you go,
but I have a few questions.

24:27.544 --> 24:31.084
Why don't you take a seat?

24:34.978 --> 24:36.717
Yeah, hello.

24:36.718 --> 24:39.478
Yeah, that's me.

24:44.928 --> 24:48.828
Yeah, okay. I'll be right there.

24:49.673 --> 24:51.260
Uh...

24:51.261 --> 24:53.574
Hey, Joss, it's me.

24:53.575 --> 24:56.460
Joss, Joss, Joss, let me talk.

24:56.461 --> 24:58.380
Savi's been in an accident.

24:58.381 --> 25:00.624
This is Paul. Leave a message.

25:00.625 --> 25:02.792
Hi, it's me, April.

25:02.793 --> 25:06.125
I am on my way to Palm
Springs for Savi's birthday.

25:06.126 --> 25:10.913
If I ever get there. God,
this traffic is insane.

25:10.914 --> 25:15.217
Anyway, I was hoping that we could meet
up for lunch or something when I get back.

25:15.218 --> 25:16.947
Call me back. Bye.

25:16.948 --> 25:19.581
Sorry I missed you. Tell me everything.

25:19.582 --> 25:22.657
Joss, you just called,
probably wondering where I am.

25:22.658 --> 25:25.777
Sorry. This traffic is
at an absolute crawl.

25:25.778 --> 25:31.178
Oh, you know, it looks like
an accident or something.

25:40.526 --> 25:42.926
Oh, my God.

25:44.562 --> 25:48.282
No pictures of anyone anywhere.

25:51.316 --> 25:56.475
I guess that's what happens when
you don't have a family of your own.

25:56.476 --> 26:02.356
I should really call my friend,
tell her when to expect me.

26:03.290 --> 26:04.698
Uh, my cell's upstairs.

26:04.699 --> 26:07.893
You were leaving town for the
weekend without your cell phone?

26:07.894 --> 26:11.074
Must have forgotten it.

26:19.423 --> 26:22.783
Don't pick it up, Karen.

26:31.802 --> 26:34.382
Stupid machine!

26:38.546 --> 26:43.166
Paul. No, no. Savi
was in a car accident.

26:43.206 --> 26:46.563
I don't know. It was pretty bad.

26:46.564 --> 26:50.123
I don't know. Um,
Ontario General hospital.

26:50.124 --> 26:51.612
I'll call you later, all right?

26:51.613 --> 26:53.632
April, hey. Where is she?

26:53.633 --> 26:54.900
Apparently still in surgery.

26:54.901 --> 26:57.117
They won't tell me a damn
thing because I'm not family.

26:57.118 --> 26:58.929
Hey, excuse me. Hello.

26:58.930 --> 27:01.901
I need whoever's in there with Savannah
Davis to know that she's pregnant.

27:01.902 --> 27:04.858
All right. One step
at a time. Who are you?

27:04.859 --> 27:07.619
I'm her husband.

27:16.167 --> 27:18.177
Harry. Where... where
is she? What's happening?

27:18.178 --> 27:20.358
She just got out of surgery.
She's critical but stable.

27:20.359 --> 27:22.724
- Critical?
- But stable. She's in recovery right now.

27:22.725 --> 27:24.499
Not out of the woods,
but so far, so good.

27:24.500 --> 27:26.701
- And the baby?
- The baby's okay. She didn't lose it.

27:26.702 --> 27:29.229
Oh, my God. April.

27:29.230 --> 27:33.749
And, uh, you might want
to give Dominic a call.

27:33.750 --> 27:36.017
Why would I do that?

27:36.018 --> 27:39.318
Because he's the father.

27:54.537 --> 27:58.197
I thought you quit years ago.

27:58.665 --> 28:00.497
Considering starting again.

28:00.498 --> 28:02.598
Mm-hmm.

28:12.579 --> 28:17.162
Hasn't been the easiest
couple of months, huh?

28:17.163 --> 28:19.743
Piece of cake.

28:20.099 --> 28:22.155
Harry, this is all my fault.

28:22.156 --> 28:24.189
If I would've just told
her the truth last night...

28:24.190 --> 28:26.760
Joss, come on.

28:26.761 --> 28:30.797
If it's anyone's fault, it's
mine, okay? I stole the damn thing.

28:30.798 --> 28:33.558
What if she doesn't pull
through this? What if...

28:33.559 --> 28:36.069
- Josslyn...
- No, you're a survivor, Harry. I'm not.

28:36.070 --> 28:38.338
I know it may seem
like I am, but I'm not.

28:38.339 --> 28:40.874
- Joss...
- I don't know what I'd do without her.

28:40.875 --> 28:42.242
Hey.

28:42.243 --> 28:45.723
She's gonna be fine, okay?

28:45.755 --> 28:49.175
And you're gonna be fine.

28:49.225 --> 28:51.865
What about you?

28:53.529 --> 28:56.949
Come on. Let's go inside.

28:57.600 --> 28:59.760
Come on.

29:04.394 --> 29:06.854
Fourth floor.

29:14.513 --> 29:16.982
What is it you want from me?

29:16.983 --> 29:19.626
An apology would be nice.

29:19.627 --> 29:22.514
I am sorry, Elizabeth.

29:22.515 --> 29:25.090
I never meant to hurt you.

29:25.091 --> 29:27.131
Really?

29:29.409 --> 29:32.771
What did you mean to do, Karen...

29:32.772 --> 29:36.612
When you stole my life from me?

29:37.203 --> 29:41.539
Let's just put the gun down,
Elizabeth, and talk about this calmly.

29:41.540 --> 29:44.690
- I'll answer anything you want.
- Anything?

29:44.691 --> 29:46.043
Yes.

29:46.044 --> 29:51.564
Did you see Tom's face when
you were screwing my son?

29:51.593 --> 29:54.113
Let's just...

29:54.523 --> 29:57.223
Talk about this.

29:57.509 --> 30:00.809
Can I make you a drink?

30:02.081 --> 30:04.661
Sure. Why not?

30:04.817 --> 30:07.685
What can I get you?

30:07.686 --> 30:09.726
Scotch.

30:13.225 --> 30:15.145
Uh...

30:15.543 --> 30:17.056
Sorry.

30:17.057 --> 30:19.010
I only have vodka.

30:19.011 --> 30:23.211
- How do you like it?
- In my hand.

30:27.381 --> 30:30.079
Karen, why aren't you
answering? Where are you?

30:30.080 --> 30:32.681
- We're all here.
- April.

30:32.682 --> 30:34.684
Harry, Joss.

30:34.685 --> 30:36.426
Paul, what are... what
are you doing here?

30:36.427 --> 30:40.356
I heard your voice, and you were
distraught, I had to show up for you.

30:40.357 --> 30:44.704
I'm never not showing up for you again.

30:44.705 --> 30:46.024
Good news, folks.

30:46.025 --> 30:48.008
- Savannah's awake.
- Oh, thank God.

30:48.009 --> 30:49.654
She had a Hemothorax.

30:49.655 --> 30:51.961
Her lung collapsed from the impact.

30:51.962 --> 30:55.257
But we put a chest tube in,
and she's breathing fine.

30:55.258 --> 30:57.447
She's still groggy
and she needs her rest.

30:57.448 --> 31:02.031
But why don't we start
with one visitor at a time?

31:02.032 --> 31:05.812
- Yeah, Joss. Go ahead.
- Okay.

31:16.312 --> 31:18.516
Hey, baby.

31:18.517 --> 31:22.461
I really screwed up
our weekend, didn't I?

31:22.462 --> 31:24.187
You kidding?

31:24.188 --> 31:26.490
We just moved the party.

31:26.491 --> 31:27.912
It's raging out there.

31:27.913 --> 31:29.713
Mm.

31:31.351 --> 31:37.099
Everyone's here except for Karen,
but she should be coming soon.

31:37.100 --> 31:38.990
Is Harry out there?

31:38.991 --> 31:40.911
Yeah.

31:41.060 --> 31:45.080
Did he... did he open the results?

31:46.809 --> 31:49.329
Yeah, he did.

31:50.213 --> 31:51.946
And he's here.

31:51.947 --> 31:53.867
Yeah.

31:57.522 --> 31:59.655
So good.

31:59.656 --> 32:01.576
Okay.

32:05.178 --> 32:07.641
After all that...

32:07.642 --> 32:11.141
You guys are gonna
talk about it, just...

32:11.142 --> 32:13.722
Get some rest.

32:24.790 --> 32:27.670
I.V. tech to 309.

32:37.989 --> 32:39.110
So...

32:39.111 --> 32:40.437
So...

32:40.438 --> 32:43.678
So we're having a kid.

32:55.014 --> 32:58.374
I'm not the father, Sav.

33:00.253 --> 33:02.016
But...

33:02.017 --> 33:03.362
You're here.

33:03.363 --> 33:07.143
Savi, God, of course I'm here.

33:07.255 --> 33:09.955
You're my love.

33:10.124 --> 33:13.244
You're still my love.

33:14.193 --> 33:15.780
Harry...

33:15.781 --> 33:21.001
When I got the call about
your accident, I just...

33:21.727 --> 33:23.427
Mm.

33:23.428 --> 33:26.368
I'm such an idiot.

33:28.521 --> 33:30.801
I don't care who the father is.

33:30.802 --> 33:32.061
Yeah.

33:32.062 --> 33:35.002
I choose you, Savi.

33:35.013 --> 33:38.253
I'll always choose you.

33:50.542 --> 33:53.912
Please put down the gun, Elizabeth.

33:53.913 --> 33:55.723
- Just listen...
- I said don't turn around!

33:55.724 --> 33:57.615
Ma'am, 9-1-1. What's
your emergency?

33:57.616 --> 34:01.853
All I'm saying is, Holly
Oak is a quiet street.

34:01.854 --> 34:05.390
The neighbors will hear the gun.

34:05.391 --> 34:09.471
Bronson Canyon is a small community.

34:10.254 --> 34:12.170
Shut up.

34:12.172 --> 34:14.692
Just shut up.

34:15.451 --> 34:17.449
You sure you want another?

34:17.451 --> 34:19.745
Oh, this one's for you, dear.

34:19.746 --> 34:21.906
Ma'am, please answer
me. Are you all right?

34:21.907 --> 34:23.817
Ma'am?

34:23.818 --> 34:25.744
Ma'am, can you hear me?

34:25.745 --> 34:28.145
Someone's...

34:29.751 --> 34:31.318
Get up.

34:31.319 --> 34:33.179
Now!

34:33.344 --> 34:35.264
Move.

34:35.938 --> 34:38.987
- Where are we going?
- Upstairs to your bedroom.

34:38.987 --> 34:42.954
Considering your recent shame, I
don't think people will be surprised...

34:42.955 --> 34:46.143
That you end your life with a fistful
of morphine and a bottle of vodka.

34:46.145 --> 34:48.245
Now go.

34:50.329 --> 34:52.309
Karen!

34:53.005 --> 34:54.860
- It's Sam.
- Don't say a word.

34:54.862 --> 34:56.842

Have you heard anything
from Paul, because...

38:01.354 --> 38:03.273
We haven't had any
contact with him in days,

38:03.274 --> 38:05.931
and he was supposed to come
back Thursday, but he...

38:05.932 --> 38:07.576
He never showed up, so...

38:07.577 --> 38:09.723
Is that daddy?

Can you just...

38:18.930 --> 38:21.912
Can you tell him to call his son?

38:21.913 --> 38:23.760
Can you please just...

38:23.761 --> 38:25.109
I don't...

38:25.110 --> 38:29.370

wants to speak to him.

Okay. Perfect.

See you soon. Bye.

38:52.762 --> 38:55.176
Was that Karen?

38:55.177 --> 38:59.008
No, I don't know where she is.

38:59.009 --> 39:02.014
But I do know the identity
of your flower fairy.

39:02.015 --> 39:04.175
Who? Ow.

39:04.238 --> 39:06.338
Ow. Ow.

39:07.869 --> 39:10.269
It was mom.

39:12.565 --> 39:15.145
She remembered?

39:15.302 --> 39:19.082
She's on the next flight home.

39:19.520 --> 39:21.336
Hey there, girl.

39:21.337 --> 39:23.137
Hi.

39:23.249 --> 39:25.381
You could say it.

39:25.382 --> 39:26.772
My hair looks terrible.

39:26.773 --> 39:28.982
- Mm.
- Mm.

39:28.983 --> 39:31.450
God, am I glad to see you.

39:31.451 --> 39:32.986
- Hey, guess what.
- Hmm?

39:32.987 --> 39:34.086
Paul's here.

39:34.087 --> 39:36.614
- What?
- No, I sent him home.

39:36.615 --> 39:39.093
What, like motel home?

39:39.094 --> 39:41.554
Miranda home.

39:43.587 --> 39:46.105
What about Richard?

39:46.106 --> 39:48.544
Broke up with him, too.

39:48.545 --> 39:51.396
How long have I been out?

39:51.397 --> 39:54.984
Last I checked, you wanted a family.

39:54.985 --> 39:57.385
I have one.

39:57.717 --> 40:00.057
Right here.

40:00.310 --> 40:02.110
Mm.

40:06.107 --> 40:08.153
I think he gave up.

40:08.154 --> 40:10.254
Now go.

40:11.029 --> 40:14.989
I'm not going up there with you.

40:17.348 --> 40:19.453
Can I tell you guys a secret?

40:19.454 --> 40:21.555
Of course.

40:21.556 --> 40:22.545
Please.

40:22.546 --> 40:25.186
Remember when...

40:25.944 --> 40:28.768
You asked me if I...

40:28.769 --> 40:33.509
Had a wish about who...
who I wanted the...

40:34.026 --> 40:36.246
Flowers...

40:37.202 --> 40:39.122
Savi?

40:39.274 --> 40:41.909
- Savi? Savi?
- Savi, wake up.

40:41.910 --> 40:44.947
Savi. Oh, my God. Help! We need help!

40:44.948 --> 40:47.986
We need help. Over here. It's
my sister. Please come here.

40:47.987 --> 40:51.209
- You came to save her, Sam?
- I can't let you do this.

40:51.210 --> 40:54.045
I don't want to lose you.

40:54.046 --> 40:57.315
All we have is each other.

40:57.316 --> 40:58.846
Savi.

40:58.847 --> 41:03.720
Please step out. Ma'am.
Let us do our job, please.

41:03.721 --> 41:06.996
You love her, Sam, don't you?
Just like your father did.

41:06.997 --> 41:09.165
He didn't love her, mom.

41:09.166 --> 41:13.178
- She was a mistake.
- Is that why he asked for her in the end?

41:13.179 --> 41:16.059
In all his pain...

41:17.195 --> 41:20.075
He looked at me...

41:21.874 --> 41:25.054
And he said, "Karen"...

41:25.277 --> 41:27.857
I want Karen".

41:30.550 --> 41:34.690
Those were the last words I heard...
