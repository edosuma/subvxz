03:43.707 --> 03:44.656
I know that.

03:45.051 --> 03:48.979
And for every 9 stocks that fell,
8 advanced. It's not Black Friday.

03:51.355 --> 03:55.960
Then, go back with that asshole
that talked into going on Enron.

03:58.940 --> 04:00.794
You know what?
Fuck you, too.

04:17.595 --> 04:18.488
Della?

04:22.491 --> 04:23.384
Della, honey?

04:26.395 --> 04:27.289
What?

04:28.348 --> 04:29.394
What's the matter?

04:30.394 --> 04:31.322
What's the matter?

04:31.867 --> 04:34.453
Honey, you want to tell me
what it is you do all day?

04:37.371 --> 04:39.574
- What do you mean?
- Well...

04:41.339 --> 04:43.891
Honey, look at the goddamn place.

04:45.179 --> 04:49.007
There's kid-shit all over the place,
wall to wall.

04:50.267 --> 04:52.723
We do the best we can.

04:53.371 --> 04:57.364
The best you can? Why don't you
just do what I tell you to do?

04:57.756 --> 05:00.587
- Stop.
- Tell me. What happened to you?

05:00.619 --> 05:03.418
- Stop.
- You should put yourself together.

05:04.635 --> 05:08.377
What do you want me to say?
We've got kids.

05:08.412 --> 05:11.892
I don't want you to say anything.
Just to keep the house clean!

05:14.235 --> 05:15.063
God.

05:18.939 --> 05:21.841
- Terry got an "A" in math.
- Goddamn it, Della!

05:22.747 --> 05:25.340
- Don't what?
- That's her favorite doll.

05:25.372 --> 05:27.356
- What?
- You'll have to fix her.

05:27.389 --> 05:28.283
I'll have to what?

05:29.243 --> 05:32.123
- You'll have to fix her.
- I'll have to what?

05:32.156 --> 05:32.919
You'll have...

05:34.331 --> 05:36.274
That's all you worry about.
The kids.

05:38.715 --> 05:41.944
I'll have to what? Would you look
at me when I'm talking to you?

05:42.682 --> 05:43.577
Stop it!

05:45.243 --> 05:48.659
Why don't you stop it?
Don't tell me what to do!

05:49.340 --> 05:51.226
- Stop it.
- You understand me?

05:51.803 --> 05:53.364
You understand what I'm saying?

05:55.130 --> 05:56.593
Don't break my arm.

05:57.851 --> 05:59.378
Don't tell me what to do!

06:06.939 --> 06:11.314
Why do you make me
do this every fucking time?

06:19.611 --> 06:21.072
What are we supposed to do now?

06:23.387 --> 06:24.533
I'm out...

06:26.491 --> 06:27.952
of wrapping paper.

06:35.131 --> 06:36.625
It's okay.

06:37.883 --> 06:39.312
Come on, it's okay.

06:48.539 --> 06:51.027
It's okay.
How are you doing?

06:51.259 --> 06:53.877
I want a Nintendo Wii
for Christmas, mom.

06:54.939 --> 06:56.946
It's only a few hours
till Christmas.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.219
- Can I get an American Girl doll?
- Guys.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.129
You wrote your letters to Santa.

07:02.363 --> 07:04.981
I don't think another letter
will make it to the North Pole.

07:07.387 --> 07:10.235
- We're going to be okay?
- We're always okay.

07:10.779 --> 07:12.729
We're always okay.

07:12.763 --> 07:15.446
- No matter what happens.
- No matter what happens.

07:24.539 --> 07:27.506
- I'll be back in a while, okay?
- Okay.

07:28.443 --> 07:31.859
Now, promise me one thing.
Listen. You, you.

07:32.091 --> 07:33.691
You have to brush your teeth.

07:33.723 --> 07:36.342
And I want you in the bed
after your treat, all right?

07:36.827 --> 07:38.485
I'll see you later.

07:41.595 --> 07:42.578
Mom!

07:44.731 --> 07:46.292
I made a secret drawing for you.

07:46.716 --> 07:49.782
- I love your drawings.
- Don't look at it yet!

07:52.187 --> 07:54.806
Okay. I'll save it for later.
How about that?

07:56.283 --> 07:57.177
Bye, sweetie.

10:36.252 --> 10:38.073
And you can kiss my ass, Kenneth.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.450
<i>Cellular 411 connect.
How may I direct your call?</i>

10:54.843 --> 10:58.869
<i>- Spring Street Learning Academy.
- Hold, while I connect you.</i>

10:59.067 --> 11:01.239
<i>Thank you for using
411 Information.</i>

11:05.532 --> 11:07.769
<i>Learning Academy.
Meghan speaking.</i>

11:08.123 --> 11:10.424
Hi, Meghan.
It's Della Myers.

11:10.619 --> 11:11.863
<i>Hi.</i>

11:12.443 --> 11:14.938
<i>Are you calling about Spanish?
It's been cancelled.</i>

11:14.973 --> 11:17.050
I knew about that.

11:17.083 --> 11:20.122
It's about next week's
mechanics class.

11:20.156 --> 11:24.410
Would you pass on to Mike
that I won't be there this time?

11:24.603 --> 11:26.197
<i>No problem.</i>

11:26.428 --> 11:28.532
<i>- I'll make sure he gets that.
- Great.</i>

11:55.580 --> 11:57.595
<i>- Hi. Della?
- What's up, Cassie?</i>

11:57.628 --> 12:01.532
<i>I'm over at the mall. What is
it we need to get for Pilates?</i>

12:01.564 --> 12:05.419
One of those rubber bands.
I'm headed over there myself.

12:05.454 --> 12:09.276
<i>Do yourself a favor. Turn around.
It's hell over here.</i>

12:09.309 --> 12:10.803
My cell's dying.

12:11.355 --> 12:12.632
You know... damn!

12:13.276 --> 12:15.866
I left the charger
in the other car.

12:15.899 --> 12:19.548
<i>Silly you. Let me pick you up
something. Save you the trip.</i>

12:19.581 --> 12:21.304
<i>- I mean...
- Are you sure?</i>

12:22.300 --> 12:23.314
No, it's okay.

12:23.548 --> 12:27.803
Cassie, can we meet for a drink?

12:27.835 --> 12:30.291
<i>You still there?
Your phone is breaking up.</i>

12:32.155 --> 12:33.049
Damn.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.697
You're kidding me.
My God!

13:04.156 --> 13:05.050
Damn it!

13:05.691 --> 13:06.585
Damn!

13:11.451 --> 13:12.728
Come on.

13:13.275 --> 13:15.800
You think you're going
to take my spot, think again!

13:15.832 --> 13:18.324
<i>I've been waiting
for 3o minutes! It's Christmas!</i>

13:20.284 --> 13:24.636
Excuse me. Where can I find a
parking space? This is ridiculous!

13:24.669 --> 13:28.156
Ma'am, there is absolutely
nothing close by.

13:28.189 --> 13:30.011
Even the valet's backed up.

13:30.364 --> 13:33.178
- You should try further out.
- Where? Over there?

13:33.883 --> 13:35.476
Now, please keep moving.

13:37.084 --> 13:38.131
Let's go.

13:39.132 --> 13:39.961
Go!

13:51.868 --> 13:52.762
Come on!

13:54.684 --> 13:55.666
Jerk!

13:56.444 --> 13:57.338
What a jerk!

16:11.100 --> 16:11.993
Over there.

16:21.564 --> 16:22.392
Smile.

16:23.003 --> 16:23.931
Good girl.

16:24.284 --> 16:25.177
Merry Christmas!

16:35.547 --> 16:38.003
- Would you like Chanel No. 5?
- No, thank you.

17:14.525 --> 17:15.670
Can I help you with that?

17:17.852 --> 17:20.186
I was just looking.
Thank you.

17:24.954 --> 17:25.817
Hi.

17:26.141 --> 17:28.114
Could I have a hot tea, please?

17:30.781 --> 17:32.471
And one chocolate biscotti.

17:33.020 --> 17:34.930
Milk or dark chocolate?

17:36.988 --> 17:38.235
No, just the tea.

17:38.269 --> 17:39.130
Name?

17:40.315 --> 17:41.529
Della.

17:41.561 --> 17:42.742
Two "L"s.

17:45.308 --> 17:46.998
US$2.65.

17:57.083 --> 17:57.978
Thank you.

18:11.452 --> 18:12.435
Della?

18:12.828 --> 18:13.723
Is that you?

18:14.876 --> 18:16.949
Lynn? Lynn Monroe.

18:17.372 --> 18:20.439
- Hi.
- I haven't seen you since college!

18:21.117 --> 18:22.130
Right.

18:22.460 --> 18:25.721
You married that handsome jock
and we never heard from you again.

18:28.637 --> 18:29.683
You live around here?

18:30.013 --> 18:33.085
We just bought this divine house
in Pleasant Valley. You know it?

18:33.117 --> 18:34.651
Yes, I do.

18:34.683 --> 18:37.465
It's perfect for the kids.
They practically walk to school.

18:37.916 --> 18:39.451
We've got a great backyard.

18:39.484 --> 18:40.891
We're thinking
of putting a pool in it.

18:41.916 --> 18:42.963
They'll love that!

18:44.540 --> 18:45.784
Enough of me.
How are you?

18:47.100 --> 18:47.993
Fine.

18:48.316 --> 18:51.829
I have two children,
Terry and Tammi. Twins.

18:54.364 --> 18:57.468
We're celebrating tonight.
David's been promoted.

18:57.502 --> 19:00.020
I had to buy this gorgeous
black teddy.

19:02.428 --> 19:04.369
It is. It's gorgeous.

19:05.084 --> 19:08.051
- It's been nice talking to you.
- You too.

19:08.284 --> 19:09.877
I've got to get my hair done.

19:11.420 --> 19:12.348
See you later.

19:12.957 --> 19:13.851
See you.

19:17.531 --> 19:18.132
Mitch!

19:18.843 --> 19:19.738
How are you?

20:06.140 --> 20:08.082
- Which one would you like?
- That one.

20:08.699 --> 20:09.594
That one?

20:10.620 --> 20:11.514
This one?

20:14.141 --> 20:15.155
That's the one?

20:16.284 --> 20:18.204
- Thanks.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.

20:18.238 --> 20:19.284
Merry Christmas!

20:24.412 --> 20:25.240
Hello.

20:33.404 --> 20:35.259
US$21.69, please.

20:37.052 --> 20:38.262
- There you go.
- Thank you.

20:43.549 --> 20:45.403
I'm sorry.
It's been declined.

20:45.852 --> 20:47.194
Do you have another card?

20:48.188 --> 20:50.076
No, I don't.

20:55.100 --> 20:55.896
Seventeen...

20:57.436 --> 20:58.614
twenty-one...

21:01.820 --> 21:02.452
There.

21:03.196 --> 21:06.556
<i>It's Christmas Eve,
and the mall is now closed.</i>

21:06.590 --> 21:07.963
<i>Happy Holidays, everyone.</i>

21:14.877 --> 21:20.408
<i>This day is borne a Savior
Of a pure, virgin bride</i>

21:21.276 --> 21:26.230
<i>To free all who trust in Him
From Satan's power and might</i>

21:26.716 --> 21:31.451
<i>Oh, tidings of comfort and joy</i>

21:33.117 --> 21:36.441
<i>Oh, tidings</i>

21:36.476 --> 21:41.844
<i>Of comfort and joy</i>

22:10.908 --> 22:11.639
Shit.

22:13.405 --> 22:15.543
Shit. What now?

22:19.453 --> 22:20.346
Excuse me?

22:20.828 --> 22:22.355
I've got a gun.

22:23.197 --> 22:25.685
How's about I aim it
at your pussy?

22:31.740 --> 22:33.562
Why don't you back your car up?

22:33.980 --> 22:35.354
That's not going to happen.

22:36.381 --> 22:39.479
What are you doing?
I don't know this game.

22:39.870 --> 22:41.243
Trust me, it's not a game.

22:41.276 --> 22:44.731
How about you shut up,
and eat a dick?

22:44.765 --> 22:47.868
When you get done, we're going
to staple your mouth shut.

22:47.902 --> 22:48.795
Right, Chuckie?

22:52.604 --> 22:54.873
"Chuckie"? Is that for real?

22:55.260 --> 22:57.748
At least your parents
have a sense of humor.

22:58.205 --> 22:59.837
I don't have any parents.

22:59.869 --> 23:00.981
I named myself.

23:01.980 --> 23:03.707
Do you have a beef
with us, honey?

23:03.740 --> 23:06.695
Because slipping a note
underneath my wipers...

23:06.728 --> 23:09.652
is an invitation to war
to me and my soldiers.

23:10.076 --> 23:12.348
If you hadn't have parked
like an asshole...

23:12.382 --> 23:14.010
we wouldn't be standing here.

23:14.044 --> 23:15.866
- Watch your mouth!
- Get away from me!

23:16.252 --> 23:18.357
You're just digging
your grave deeper.

23:19.676 --> 23:22.168
- Where you going?
- Fuck you!

23:22.203 --> 23:24.660
- Fuck you.
- No, fuck you!

23:24.989 --> 23:26.363
Any trouble here, ma'am?

23:26.748 --> 23:28.829
Not if these punks
move their car!

23:28.862 --> 23:30.356
What's the deal, Barney Fife?

23:30.716 --> 23:34.263
Okay, boys. Back your car up
and let the lady out.

23:34.941 --> 23:36.119
How does that sound, squirt?

23:37.213 --> 23:39.896
We're not in the mood.
In fact...

23:40.957 --> 23:44.372
mind your fucking business,
and go direct some traffic.

23:44.604 --> 23:46.809
I'm going to make
this my business.

23:47.452 --> 23:51.133
Now, why don't you pile back
into your piece-of-shit car...

23:51.166 --> 23:52.921
and get the fuck out of my mall?

23:53.340 --> 23:55.577
Did you hear what I said?
Did you hear me?

23:57.213 --> 23:59.052
Did you hear me, daddy?
Get out of here!

23:59.085 --> 24:00.859
- Put the gun down.
- Get out of here!

24:00.892 --> 24:03.415
- Put the gun down!
- I said, get out of here!

24:03.449 --> 24:05.940
- Put the gun down!
- You want me to put it down?

24:06.685 --> 24:08.178
Make me, bitch!
I said...

24:16.092 --> 24:17.652
- Shit.
- Motherfucker.

24:28.668 --> 24:29.616
She's getting away!

24:33.245 --> 24:36.891
<i>Fuck, man! She's probably
on the phone with 5-o already!</i>

24:36.924 --> 24:41.628
- We're going to go down for this!
- Don't worry about it, nigga.

24:41.663 --> 24:45.426
Don't call me "nigga".
You ain't the right. None of you.

24:46.205 --> 24:47.579
Take it easy, Huey.

24:48.092 --> 24:49.467
Take it easy.
We got this.

24:49.692 --> 24:51.836
The world is our bitch.
Get in the car.

24:51.871 --> 24:52.699
Now.

24:52.829 --> 24:54.868
Move over, Tomas!
Come on!

24:55.132 --> 24:57.914
- The cop went down hard.
- Goddamn it, Tomas. Shut up!

25:42.941 --> 25:43.834
My God.

26:12.829 --> 26:13.722
Oh, God.

28:09.565 --> 28:10.579
Hell, no.

28:13.500 --> 28:14.586
- Damn!
- What?

28:14.621 --> 28:16.628
My new Keds are all dirty!

28:26.301 --> 28:27.674
Get there and push!

28:27.709 --> 28:30.294
The car's got nowhere to go.
The road ends there.

28:31.164 --> 28:33.336
There's nothing
but houses and trees.

28:34.749 --> 28:36.024
Ditch the car, man.

28:36.349 --> 28:37.690
We've got a witness on the loose.

28:39.485 --> 28:40.603
Trust me.

28:40.636 --> 28:45.012
You won't hear a peep from her.
She's going down, execution style.

28:45.469 --> 28:46.746
What if she's gone already?

28:50.909 --> 28:52.184
She's not gone.

28:52.989 --> 28:54.363
There's no place for her to go.

28:58.429 --> 29:00.338
<i>Damn. She took out that barrier.</i>

29:05.117 --> 29:08.466
<i>It's going to be impossible to
find her, even if she is around.</i>

29:09.597 --> 29:11.091
<i>Come on, guys.</i>

29:13.309 --> 29:14.683
Maybe we can hotwire the truck.

29:43.805 --> 29:45.659
I'll find you now, cunt!

29:52.445 --> 29:55.194
We caught up in this
like it's a soap opera.

29:55.964 --> 29:59.281
We need to blast out of town,
act like we were never around.

29:59.869 --> 30:02.461
- Vingh, get over here.
- How much "Kill" you been smoking?

30:02.494 --> 30:05.197
Come on, man. No one cares
about a fucking Rent-A-Pig!

30:05.232 --> 30:07.900
He's just collateral damage
to the people at the mall.

30:07.934 --> 30:09.499
She's the only witness!

30:09.533 --> 30:11.547
If we hit the road right now...

30:11.580 --> 30:13.979
w could be miles away
before they find out.

30:14.012 --> 30:17.308
We could be swimming in the
Atlantic, like you promised me.

30:19.453 --> 30:20.380
Huey, come here.

30:22.013 --> 30:22.908
Come here.

30:26.269 --> 30:28.893
Remember how I broke
you out of that home?

30:28.926 --> 30:30.900
I was there for you, right?

30:32.348 --> 30:33.777
You trust me, right?

30:34.620 --> 30:35.603
Right?

30:38.142 --> 30:41.589
All we got to do is find her,
and we're out of here. I promise.

30:41.821 --> 30:42.715
That's it.

30:43.101 --> 30:44.148
There's her Ford!

30:56.221 --> 30:59.805
Somebody tell her mom
to lay out her black dress.

30:59.838 --> 31:01.275
Why? Is she dead?

31:01.309 --> 31:02.972
No, she went through her trunk.

31:03.006 --> 31:03.704
She's here.

31:04.477 --> 31:05.687
She's hiding somewhere.

31:07.069 --> 31:10.036
She left her purse.
It's all in here. Her cell phone.

31:10.813 --> 31:12.024
<i>Where are you?</i>

31:12.285 --> 31:15.003
<i>- Her battery gave out.
- We're going to find you!</i>

31:16.861 --> 31:17.526
There she is!

31:18.076 --> 31:19.505
Go that way! That way!

31:41.405 --> 31:42.266
Fuck!

31:44.317 --> 31:46.139
- You see her down there?
- No, man.

31:47.517 --> 31:50.005
- She must have gone around.
- She vanished.

31:50.972 --> 31:52.467
Check each one of these houses.

31:54.238 --> 31:56.213
Split up. Spread out!

32:12.925 --> 32:13.873
Della!

32:21.244 --> 32:22.586
We know who you are!

32:23.805 --> 32:25.298
You can't hide, honey.

32:44.798 --> 32:47.546
We're not going to give up
till we find you, Della.

32:51.964 --> 32:53.340
You're trapped, Della.

32:57.085 --> 32:58.547
We're going to find you!

33:12.124 --> 33:14.034
Where's Little Red Riding Hood?

33:25.598 --> 33:27.899
Where was that?
Check the house next door!

33:28.413 --> 33:29.308
Move it!

34:26.077 --> 34:27.900
There she is!

34:28.541 --> 34:30.962
- We got you.
- You're dead, bitch.

34:31.774 --> 34:32.601
Time to say goodbye.

34:36.318 --> 34:38.389
You hear that?
Do you hear that?

34:39.197 --> 34:42.132
It's the sound of the waves!
Sounds good, right?

34:43.038 --> 34:45.239
Yeah, Chuckie.
It sounds great.

34:49.918 --> 34:51.226
Don't worry.

34:51.773 --> 34:54.969
When we're done with you,
we'll send you back to mister...

34:57.213 --> 34:59.710
You want play nice?
You want to play?

34:59.742 --> 35:01.466
Back off! Hold back!

35:02.205 --> 35:03.252
Give me a minute.

35:07.965 --> 35:09.338
I'm sorry about that.

35:10.972 --> 35:12.053
I'm sorry.

35:13.662 --> 35:14.609
You okay?

35:16.605 --> 35:17.499
Chill out.

35:17.885 --> 35:19.029
You all right?

35:19.838 --> 35:20.853
Settle down!

35:21.533 --> 35:22.516
Settle down!

35:23.805 --> 35:25.715
You all right? Settle down.

35:26.654 --> 35:28.661
You know how we know your name?

35:29.693 --> 35:33.554
You messed up, Della.
You left your purse in the car.

35:34.621 --> 35:35.320
Give me that.

35:41.918 --> 35:43.860
Your photo
doesn't do you justice.

35:44.669 --> 35:45.597
He is right.

35:45.854 --> 35:48.821
- You look better in person.
- You do.

35:50.013 --> 35:50.961
You look good.

35:54.494 --> 35:56.021
You're not going
to need it anymore.

36:09.246 --> 36:10.839
What's in that box, Della?

36:14.142 --> 36:15.483
What's in the box?

36:16.541 --> 36:18.396
What's in the box, girl?

36:18.942 --> 36:21.756
What's up? You think
she's carrying some cash?

36:22.461 --> 36:23.890
Some jewelry or something?

36:24.765 --> 36:25.692
I don't know.

36:26.685 --> 36:27.667
I don't know.

36:29.277 --> 36:31.316
Maybe she cashed in
her life savings.

36:32.509 --> 36:33.719
Plan on running away?

36:34.749 --> 36:36.026
Start a new life?

36:36.349 --> 36:37.559
That is it, Della?

36:37.790 --> 36:39.961
You got enough scratch
to buy us off?

36:41.117 --> 36:42.165
Open the box.

36:42.717 --> 36:43.797
Open the box!

36:44.829 --> 36:46.236
- Open it!
- Okay.

36:46.461 --> 36:48.763
Take the box. We're going
to kill her anyway.

36:50.909 --> 36:52.054
I'll open the box.

36:59.389 --> 37:00.599
You know what?

37:01.725 --> 37:03.100
She ain't got nothing.

37:04.157 --> 37:05.913
Let's take that pussy
and get going.

37:09.757 --> 37:10.651
I got her!

37:11.805 --> 37:12.852
Down there!

37:13.214 --> 37:14.107
Look out, Huey!

37:19.357 --> 37:21.261
- What the fuck, niggas?
- Shut up!

37:21.295 --> 37:23.165
- Are you hurt?
- I said, shut up!

37:24.285 --> 37:25.594
And don't use the N-word.

37:26.398 --> 37:27.924
You ain't representing.

37:33.501 --> 37:34.395
Huey?

37:35.933 --> 37:37.788
- What did you do?
- What do you mean?

37:38.431 --> 37:39.640
<i>Stop fucking around.</i>

37:43.485 --> 37:44.499
Huey?

37:47.229 --> 37:49.369
- What's up, little brother?
- Spare me, God.

37:49.662 --> 37:51.035
Quit fucking around.

37:51.933 --> 37:52.827
Huey?

38:04.029 --> 38:04.978
What's up?

38:08.381 --> 38:09.275
Fuck!

38:10.845 --> 38:11.610
Fuck!

38:18.109 --> 38:19.004
Come on, man.

38:19.229 --> 38:21.533
What the fuck did you do?
Get off him!

38:21.567 --> 38:22.427
I didn't kill him.

38:22.910 --> 38:26.258
- You stepped on his face!
- Don't touch me!

38:26.493 --> 38:29.395
- I didn't kill him! She did.
- Get the fuck off!

38:31.549 --> 38:33.720
God! Huey!

38:34.941 --> 38:37.625
- I'm going to get that bitch!
- You let her go!

38:38.398 --> 38:40.154
You piece of shit!
Where the fuck is she?

38:55.133 --> 38:56.027
Fuck.

39:50.525 --> 39:51.900
<i>Della!</i>

39:54.813 --> 39:56.307
<i>Della!</i>

40:06.878 --> 40:08.089
<i>Della!</i>

42:49.758 --> 42:53.932
<i>I guess you are right
When we talked in the heat</i>

42:53.965 --> 42:58.107
<i>There's no room for the weak
No room for the weak</i>

43:00.030 --> 43:02.616
<i>Where will it end?</i>

43:03.486 --> 43:05.177
<i>Where will it end?</i>

43:07.166 --> 43:09.467
<i>Where will it end?</i>

43:10.622 --> 43:12.695
<i>Where will it end?</i>

43:29.758 --> 43:32.627
<i>This is the room
The start of it all</i>

43:33.214 --> 43:36.892
<i>They're talking to you
I remember it all</i>

43:36.926 --> 43:40.345
<i>I've seen the night
Filled with blood and pain</i>

43:40.378 --> 43:43.764
<i>And the bodies obtained
And the bodies obtained</i>

43:44.062 --> 43:45.785
<i>And the bodies obtained</i>

43:48.892 --> 43:49.940
What are you doing?

43:54.814 --> 43:55.707
It's a tribute.

43:56.382 --> 43:57.396
A gesture.

43:59.582 --> 44:01.753
<i>Where will it end?</i>

44:02.462 --> 44:05.113
That'll wake up every
cop in Podunk county!

44:08.222 --> 44:09.116
It's for him.

44:10.621 --> 44:11.832
It's for Huey.

44:39.773 --> 44:41.268
I didn't mean it, Huey.

44:43.869 --> 44:44.852
What did you say?

44:47.230 --> 44:48.124
What?

44:48.830 --> 44:50.553
I didn't mean to kill him.

44:51.230 --> 44:53.980
Get away from him.
Get the fuck away from him!

44:56.349 --> 44:57.778
Get the fuck away from him!

44:59.070 --> 45:02.518
Get away from him!
Get away! Get away!

45:03.358 --> 45:05.213
- Get away!
- Fuck you!

45:09.118 --> 45:10.492
<i>I'm going to get you!</i>

45:11.357 --> 45:12.503
Do you hear me, Della?

45:13.246 --> 45:14.391
I'm going to get you!

45:45.886 --> 45:46.714
God.

46:02.526 --> 46:04.697
MOMMY WE LOVE YOU

46:30.814 --> 46:31.709
<i>Della!</i>

46:46.462 --> 46:47.673
<i>Della?</i>

47:07.646 --> 47:08.540
Wait.

47:10.111 --> 47:11.003
It's "Bulgari".

47:11.709 --> 47:14.427
- What's "Bulgari"?
- It's a perfume, dude.

47:14.750 --> 47:17.171
It smells more
like that No. 5 shit.

47:17.822 --> 47:20.604
- "Chanel".
- No, it's "Bulgari".

47:20.957 --> 47:22.485
My dad's bitch bathes in it.

47:43.133 --> 47:44.027
It's blood.

47:49.119 --> 47:50.132
It's her blood.

47:50.655 --> 47:51.767
Maybe she's hurt.

48:02.079 --> 48:03.027
This way.

48:08.414 --> 48:10.171
Go, go, go!

48:17.693 --> 48:18.807
<i>Watch out, dude.</i>

48:21.471 --> 48:22.364
<i>Look out!</i>

48:26.303 --> 48:27.195
Damn!

48:41.023 --> 48:42.968
- Shit!
- What happened?

48:43.002 --> 48:44.915
I stepped in the stream!

48:51.231 --> 48:54.099
- That was raw.
- Who cares, man?

48:54.334 --> 48:56.603
Nobody gives a shit
if we live or die.

48:57.406 --> 49:00.767
Quit playing with the flashlight.
We are stumbling in the dark!

49:00.800 --> 49:02.937
He who finds it, shines it.

49:03.711 --> 49:05.751
- Let's go!
- Where the hell is she?

49:06.239 --> 49:08.214
- Shut up and move it!
- Damn!

49:09.663 --> 49:10.907
Let's go, guys.

49:11.678 --> 49:12.661
There she is!

49:25.565 --> 49:26.809
Don't let her get away!

49:31.455 --> 49:32.284
Huey?

49:33.055 --> 49:34.069
Is that you, Huey?

49:34.783 --> 49:36.474
I saw him there in those trees!

49:44.799 --> 49:45.693
Sure you did.

49:56.638 --> 49:58.199
Son of a bitch!

50:00.959 --> 50:03.326
I'm going to get you, bitch!

50:17.598 --> 50:18.678
You will see!

50:19.903 --> 50:21.147
You fucking bitch!

50:24.638 --> 50:25.914
Son of a bitch!

50:52.670 --> 50:54.163
Time's up, you bitch.

51:07.647 --> 51:08.540
God!

51:48.735 --> 51:49.629
Tomas!

51:51.455 --> 51:52.348
Quiet.

51:58.879 --> 52:00.472
Tomas is gone.

52:01.342 --> 52:02.325
I can feel it.

52:04.734 --> 52:06.906
He's probably got her
strung up by now.

52:08.799 --> 52:10.228
There's something over here.

52:11.646 --> 52:12.628
Looks like a body.

52:20.222 --> 52:22.556
It's a tree stump,
you dumb wonton.

52:50.591 --> 52:51.484
Tomas...

53:03.838 --> 53:05.562
She's going to kill us too.

53:06.110 --> 53:07.539
We're all going to die here.

53:11.358 --> 53:13.725
No gun can kill
a spirit gone bad.

53:14.398 --> 53:16.853
She's gone bad.
She's gone bad.

53:18.719 --> 53:19.612
Gone bad.

53:22.816 --> 53:24.341
I'm going to get this girl.

53:33.438 --> 53:34.648
I'm sorry.

53:36.703 --> 53:38.459
I'm so sorry.

53:49.600 --> 53:53.461
Where are you, God?
Where are you?

53:54.686 --> 53:57.686
All I want to do
is see my babies!

54:00.990 --> 54:04.471
Where are you?
Where are you?

54:15.135 --> 54:16.063
Fuck.

54:17.023 --> 54:18.966
Fuck, fuck!

54:59.262 --> 55:00.211
Over there, Chuckie!

55:09.246 --> 55:10.228
You're going down!

55:17.790 --> 55:18.772
Slow down, bitch.

55:21.119 --> 55:23.639
- Fuck.
- Get of my way, Vingh!

55:25.630 --> 55:26.646
Get up!

55:28.831 --> 55:30.871
Get up! She's taking off!

55:59.390 --> 56:02.457
I don't feel good, Chuckie.
I got hypothermia.

56:03.006 --> 56:04.087
You'll be fine.

56:04.959 --> 56:07.065
It ain't natural how
she gets away every time.

56:08.927 --> 56:10.171
Let's get this over with.

56:10.879 --> 56:13.148
You go up there.
I'll cover you.

56:13.790 --> 56:16.344
I ain't going there without
the gun. End of story.

56:17.759 --> 56:19.450
I never pegged you for a pussy.

56:20.639 --> 56:24.126
Even when Tomas called it,
I always defended you.

56:24.161 --> 56:25.654
<i>No one ever called me a pussy.</i>

56:26.046 --> 56:29.790
<i>She couldn't weight more than 12o.
You could break her in half</i>

56:29.825 --> 56:32.726
- Tomas never called me a pussy!
- Fine.

56:33.566 --> 56:35.356
You don't want to go? Don't go.

56:35.391 --> 56:38.936
I'm going to get this bitch
for Tomas. For Huey.

56:55.806 --> 56:56.701
You go up.

56:57.504 --> 56:58.780
I'm going to go around the side.

57:07.134 --> 57:08.508
No limits on power.

57:16.352 --> 57:17.757
No limits on power!

58:31.327 --> 58:32.375
<i>Vingh?</i>

01:00:06.911 --> 01:00:07.893
Della?

01:00:19.006 --> 01:00:20.381
Della?

01:00:40.671 --> 01:00:42.526
<i>It's just you and me left now.</i>

01:00:46.431 --> 01:00:48.766
I saw a trail
of your blood back there.

01:00:51.519 --> 01:00:52.926
You must be hurt.

01:01:01.312 --> 01:01:02.521
I'm hurting, too.

01:01:04.863 --> 01:01:06.391
<i>You busted my collarbone.</i>

01:01:09.823 --> 01:01:11.317
<i>I know you can hear me.</i>

01:01:13.472 --> 01:01:15.033
I can smell your sweat.

01:01:22.399 --> 01:01:23.578
I can smell your blood.

01:01:28.895 --> 01:01:30.270
I know you're close.

01:01:41.951 --> 01:01:45.147
After what went down tonight,
we got a special bond.

01:01:47.968 --> 01:01:49.823
You may come out now.

01:01:55.327 --> 01:01:56.472
<i>Want a cigarette?</i>

01:01:59.039 --> 01:02:01.657
<i>I'll save one for you,
for when you decide to come out.</i>

01:02:06.526 --> 01:02:08.381
<i>You are one tough bitch!</i>

01:02:13.983 --> 01:02:15.227
And that is hot.

01:02:25.055 --> 01:02:28.984
They are really cute.
Twins, huh?

01:02:30.687 --> 01:02:33.337
<i>A woman's purse can
tell her whole life story.</i>

01:02:37.663 --> 01:02:40.761
Are you sure you don't want
a cigarette now? Della?

01:02:42.591 --> 01:02:43.486
Honey?

01:02:45.182 --> 01:02:49.078
Now I know where they live.
Maybe I'll stop by and say hi.

01:02:55.263 --> 01:02:57.270
I figured that'd help
to find your voice.

01:02:59.616 --> 01:03:00.794
Don't worry.

01:03:01.023 --> 01:03:02.779
I wouldn't hurt them.

01:03:04.672 --> 01:03:06.647
It's wrong to hurt kids, right?

01:03:08.543 --> 01:03:09.918
The game's over, Della.

01:03:12.415 --> 01:03:13.308
You won.

01:03:37.312 --> 01:03:38.686
You took him from me, Della.

01:03:41.152 --> 01:03:42.678
He was like my little brother.

01:03:50.559 --> 01:03:52.764
All he wanted to do
was see the ocean.

01:03:55.199 --> 01:03:56.759
But he never got to see it.

01:04:00.959 --> 01:04:02.389
No, he never got to go.

01:04:07.168 --> 01:04:08.596
They're all gone now.

01:04:23.006 --> 01:04:24.218
Let's see here.

01:04:25.952 --> 01:04:27.381
Monday, Pilates.

01:04:28.959 --> 01:04:30.617
Tuesday, Spanish.

01:04:32.192 --> 01:04:34.494
Wednesday, Mechanics?

01:04:39.136 --> 01:04:41.655
Thursday, Friday...

01:04:44.704 --> 01:04:45.979
Face it, Della.

01:04:47.648 --> 01:04:49.786
You're no suburban housewife.

01:04:54.656 --> 01:04:56.444
You bought into the big lie.

01:04:58.848 --> 01:05:00.025
You even tried to live it.

01:05:03.071 --> 01:05:03.965
Husband...

01:05:04.991 --> 01:05:05.885
house...

01:05:06.784 --> 01:05:07.677
security...

01:05:09.119 --> 01:05:10.461
every woman's dream.

01:05:14.494 --> 01:05:15.706
But not yours.

01:05:18.175 --> 01:05:20.279
You know there's no
such thing as security.

01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:33.400
I reckon I know what
you've been dreaming about.

01:05:34.944 --> 01:05:36.634
What you've been aching for...

01:05:37.312 --> 01:05:39.002
all these lonely years.

01:05:41.408 --> 01:05:42.716
The wind in your hair.

01:05:43.903 --> 01:05:45.758
The dirt of life
between your fingers.

01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:49.535
Taking what you want from life.

01:05:51.839 --> 01:05:52.788
Right, Della?

01:05:55.262 --> 01:05:57.238
Don't tell me you
haven't thought about it.

01:05:59.552 --> 01:06:00.762
It's in your blood.

01:06:03.232 --> 01:06:05.534
I bet your husband
doesn't treat you right.

01:06:07.807 --> 01:06:09.117
Takes you for granted.

01:06:13.472 --> 01:06:15.130
You can't go back to that.

01:06:17.663 --> 01:06:19.158
You don't want
to go back to that.

01:06:23.103 --> 01:06:24.794
Let's go pick up your kids.

01:06:26.368 --> 01:06:27.262
Right now.

01:06:29.823 --> 01:06:31.317
And we'll get rid of him.

01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:33.726
You can do it.

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:36.636
I can do it.

01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:49.054
It's okay.

01:07:10.495 --> 01:07:11.389
Come here.

01:07:28.031 --> 01:07:29.176
Hell of a night, huh?

01:07:49.407 --> 01:07:50.423
Close your eyes.

01:07:52.864 --> 01:07:53.912
Close your eyes.

01:08:00.448 --> 01:08:01.757
You're amazing, Della.

01:08:06.239 --> 01:08:07.221
So beautiful.

01:09:02.496 --> 01:09:04.121
You've been a bad girl.

01:09:15.903 --> 01:09:17.048
You're a bad girl.

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:22.493
Fuck me.

01:09:24.799 --> 01:09:25.693
Fuck me.

01:14:42.816 --> 01:14:49.340
<i>You can count on me</i>

01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:59.321
<i>Please have snow and mistletoe</i>

01:14:59.616 --> 01:15:04.635
<i>And presents under the tree</i>

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:15.928
<i>Christmas Eve will find me</i>

01:15:19.296 --> 01:15:23.835
<i>Where the love light gleams</i>

01:15:25.472 --> 01:15:33.241
<i>I'll be home for Christmas</i>

01:15:34.816 --> 01:15:40.664
<i>If only in my</i>

01:15:42.208 --> 01:15:43.899
<i>Dreams</i>

01:15:50.016 --> 01:15:52.699
<i>You want to tell me where
you've been all night, honey?</i>

01:15:53.664 --> 01:15:55.224
Don't ever call me that again.

01:15:55.808 --> 01:15:56.670
What?

01:15:59.296 --> 01:16:02.231
<i>You can't even take
your shoes off at the door?</i>

01:16:02.977 --> 01:16:04.285
<i>The Japanese do it!</i>

01:16:05.345 --> 01:16:06.238
<i>I do it.</i>

01:16:44.096 --> 01:16:46.168
I see you got the paper.
What'd you get me?

01:16:54.496 --> 01:16:56.187
What did you get me at the mall?

01:16:59.872 --> 01:17:00.919
Nothing.

01:17:02.081 --> 01:17:05.910
<i>In every dream home
A heartache</i>

01:17:07.392 --> 01:17:09.726
<i>And every step I take</i>

01:17:11.137 --> 01:17:14.334
<i>Takes me further from heaven</i>

01:17:18.368 --> 01:17:20.278
<i>Is there a heaven?</i>

01:17:22.881 --> 01:17:25.214
<i>I'd like to think so</i>

01:17:29.504 --> 01:17:31.741
<i>Standards of living</i>

01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:36.092
<i>They're rising daily</i>

01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:40.896
<i>But home, oh, sweet home</i>

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:44.859
<i>It's only a saying</i>

01:17:47.008 --> 01:17:50.107
<i>From bell-push to faucet</i>

01:17:51.584 --> 01:17:54.747
<i>In smart-town apartments</i>

01:17:56.161 --> 01:17:58.462
<i>The cottage is pretty</i>

01:18:00.577 --> 01:18:03.423
<i>The main house a palace</i>

01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:10.337
<i>Penthouse perfection
But what goes on?</i>

01:18:10.370 --> 01:18:12.344
<i>What to do there?</i>

01:18:12.576 --> 01:18:14.879
<i>Better pray there</i>

01:18:23.649 --> 01:18:25.918
<i>Open-plan living</i>

01:18:28.128 --> 01:18:30.846
<i>Bungalow ranch-style</i>

01:18:32.416 --> 01:18:35.230
<i>All of its comforts</i>

01:18:36.896 --> 01:18:39.417
<i>Seem so essential</i>

01:18:41.216 --> 01:18:43.835
<i>I bought you mail order</i>

01:18:45.535 --> 01:18:48.535
<i>My plain-wrapper baby</i>

01:18:50.048 --> 01:18:52.437
<i>Your skin is like vinyl</i>

01:18:54.305 --> 01:18:56.672
<i>The perfect companion</i>

01:18:58.784 --> 01:19:01.598
<i>You float in my new pool</i>

01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:06.107
<i>Deluxe and delightful</i>

01:19:07.744 --> 01:19:10.461
<i>Inflatable doll</i>

01:19:12.384 --> 01:19:14.938
<i>My role is to serve you</i>

01:19:16.545 --> 01:19:19.360
<i>Disposable darling</i>

01:19:21.217 --> 01:19:23.769
<i>Can't throw you away now</i>

01:19:25.504 --> 01:19:28.603
<i>Immortal and life-size</i>

01:19:29.888 --> 01:19:32.670
<i>My breath is inside you</i>

01:19:34.465 --> 01:19:36.919
<i>I'll dress you up daily</i>

01:19:39.072 --> 01:19:42.040
<i>And keep you till death sighs</i>

01:19:43.391 --> 01:19:45.879
<i>Inflatable doll</i>

01:19:48.161 --> 01:19:50.332
<i>Lover ungrateful</i>

01:19:52.448 --> 01:19:55.131
<i>I blew up your body</i>

01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:00.575
<i>But you blew my mind</i>

01:20:18.815 --> 01:20:20.888
<i>Oh, honey</i>

01:20:24.801 --> 01:20:27.899
<i>Dream home heartaches</i>

01:20:31.648 --> 01:20:34.136
<i>Oh, honey</i>

01:20:38.208 --> 01:20:40.858
<i>Dream home heartaches</i>

01:20:45.153 --> 01:20:47.257
<i>Oh, honey</i>

01:20:51.489 --> 01:20:54.139
<i>Dream home heartaches</i>

01:21:54.140 --> 01:21:55.140
