00:14.280 --> 00:16.120
Five power plants are ready to melt down.

00:16.200 --> 00:18.600
All I care about is making sure
that doesn't happen.

00:18.680 --> 00:22.560
Your name is on a lease on a building in
Chatsworth that was used to plan the attack.

00:22.640 --> 00:26.840
- That makes you a prime suspect.
- " I don't know about that building.

00:26.920 --> 00:28.720
" I don't believe you.

00:32.479 --> 00:34.760
Jack, please don't.

00:34.840 --> 00:39.080
I don't know the specific building
you're talking about. I can find out.

00:39.160 --> 00:40.160
How?

00:40.240 --> 00:42.840
My corporate records
are stored on my laptop.

00:42.920 --> 00:44.800
Here it is. It's Harris Barnes.

00:45.280 --> 00:49.160
Interpol traced the name and listed
foreign nationals who have used it.

00:49.240 --> 00:52.760
- Who used it most recently?
- A man named Habib Marwan.

00:52.840 --> 00:55.480
- We need to find him.
- I think we have.

01:00.640 --> 01:02.120
- " You OK?
- Yeah.

01:02.200 --> 01:05.600
I overheard a phone conversation.
We have less than 15 minutes.

01:05.680 --> 01:10.720
Have your men secure the floor.
Curtis and I are going after the override.

01:14.160 --> 01:15.840
Stay down!

01:15.920 --> 01:18.000
Stay down.

01:18.080 --> 01:20.080
Marwan is impersonating a CTU officer.

01:20.160 --> 01:23.400
I repeat, the suspect
is impersonating a CTU officer.

01:27.920 --> 01:30.280
Edgar! Line one.
Curtis has the override.

01:30.360 --> 01:32.480
- " The override logged in?"
- Yes.

01:32.560 --> 01:35.360
Good. Send it to channel 11. Hurry up.

01:40.240 --> 01:42.360
" They're starting to respond.

01:42.440 --> 01:44.720
- It's working, Edgar.
- Yes! Yes!

01:44.800 --> 01:47.200
The temperature is dropping
in all remaining power plants.

01:47.280 --> 01:48.640
" Congratulations, Edgar.

01:49.080 --> 01:54.520
Ms Driscoll? It's about Maya.
You'd better go down to the clinic right away.

01:54.600 --> 01:56.160
Maya?

01:58.320 --> 02:00.720
Oh! Oh!

02:03.120 --> 02:05.120
Oh, baby!

02:05.640 --> 02:07.640
No!

02:20.520 --> 02:22.400
- " I got new intel."
- What?

02:22.480 --> 02:27.160
The man you're looking for,
Habib Marwan, works for McLennan-Forster.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.400
But they made the override.

02:29.480 --> 02:34.200
He's working under the alias Harris Barnes.
They had no reason to suspect.

02:34.280 --> 02:38.440
He positioned himself inside the company
so he could use their technology.

02:38.520 --> 02:41.720
Tell 'em to freeze Marwan's personal files.

02:41.800 --> 02:44.480
I did. You want me
to send a comm team over?

02:44.560 --> 02:47.920
- No, we're closer. Jack or I'll go.
- "Sure."

02:48.000 --> 02:50.680
Marwan was in the building
within the last 15 minutes.

02:50.760 --> 02:53.840
I want perimeters here,
roadblocks in every direction.

02:53.920 --> 02:56.280
- Done.
- Jack. I just got off with CTU.

02:56.360 --> 03:00.240
Marwan worked for McLennan-Forster
under an alias, Harris Barnes.

03:00.320 --> 03:02.320
- I told CTU we'd check it out.
- OK.

03:02.400 --> 03:06.960
Take Paul and Audrey back to CTU.
I'll be on my cell. Castle'll stay in charge here.

03:07.040 --> 03:09.560
If he's in the area,
our teams will pick him up.

03:09.640 --> 03:12.520
- Curtis will take you back to CTU.
- What about you?

03:12.600 --> 03:15.720
- I have to go to McLennan-Forster.
- Why there?

03:15.800 --> 03:18.560
Turns out the man
we're looking for works there.

03:18.640 --> 03:21.360
- Need to get into their computer system?
- Yeah.

03:21.440 --> 03:23.480
OK. I'll go with you.

03:23.560 --> 03:25.880
- Why?
- My company sold them their IT system.

03:25.960 --> 03:29.320
I designed the database.
It's encoded with military security.

03:29.400 --> 03:32.600
McLennan-Forster has personnel
that can get into his files.

03:32.680 --> 03:38.040
Yeah, well, I can get you in back doors
those people don't even know about.

03:41.840 --> 03:43.840
Fine. You go with me.

03:43.920 --> 03:46.600
Audrey, I want you to stay with Curtis.

03:47.840 --> 03:50.480
I'll be on my cell.
Let's go.

04:08.120 --> 04:10.120
Stop.

04:49.040 --> 04:51.040
Goodbye, baby girl.

04:56.880 --> 05:00.160
OK. I'll let everyone here know.

05:00.840 --> 05:02.720
Yeah, thanks, Nat.

05:03.240 --> 05:05.920
Let everyone know what?

05:06.000 --> 05:09.040
Driscoll's daughter
committed suicide in our clinic.

05:09.120 --> 05:12.040
- How did she do that?
- She slit her wrists.

05:12.120 --> 05:16.600
- Doesn't make sense. She was watched.
- I don't know, Edgar. I wasn't there.

05:16.680 --> 05:20.320
I was just thinking out loud.
You don't have to be so hostile.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.480
Excuse me, Mr Secretary.

05:37.600 --> 05:40.840
Where's Driscoll?
The president's about to come on.

05:40.920 --> 05:45.680
- Something terrible just happened, sir.
- What's that?

05:45.760 --> 05:50.280
Ms Driscoll's daughter Maya committed
suicide in our clinic 15 minutes ago.

05:50.360 --> 05:54.160
Apparently the doctor walked in and she...

05:54.240 --> 05:56.160
Erin.

05:56.240 --> 06:00.040
Sarah just told me. I am so sorry.

06:00.960 --> 06:03.480
Thank you, sir.

06:03.560 --> 06:06.640
- Go back to the floor, Sarah.
- Yes, ma'am.

06:06.720 --> 06:09.080
Erin, you do not need to be here.

06:09.960 --> 06:13.080
Where should I be, sir?
We're still in crisis mode.

06:13.160 --> 06:18.160
Habib Marwan is still out there, and we've no
idea how many other cells he might activate.

06:18.240 --> 06:21.760
- For God's sake, Erin...
- Our systems are in a transition state

06:21.840 --> 06:25.280
that require my constant attention.

06:26.480 --> 06:30.560
I'm not in denial about
my daughter's death, nor am I in shock.

06:30.640 --> 06:34.520
I can perform my duties until
you find a suitable replacement for me.

06:34.600 --> 06:37.800
Ms Driscoll?
The president's coming on now.

06:37.880 --> 06:39.760
Thank you, William.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.360
Jim? Erin?

06:45.160 --> 06:50.000
First, I want to express my deep gratitude
for what you've accomplished so far today.

06:50.080 --> 06:54.640
Wresting back control of the override
has saved thousands of American lives.

06:54.720 --> 07:00.280
And the latest NRC report is that the San
Gabriel Island meltdown is under control.

07:00.360 --> 07:03.280
That's great news.
But has your staff informed you

07:03.360 --> 07:05.800
that we still have a few
problems to deal with?

07:05.880 --> 07:07.960
Yes, and that's why I'm calling you.

07:08.040 --> 07:11.240
The man responsible
for today's attack is still at large.

07:11.320 --> 07:14.560
Yes, sir, he is. His name is Habib Marwan.

07:14.640 --> 07:18.560
He's been a long-term employee
of a major defence contractor.

07:18.640 --> 07:20.840
Yes, I heard. McLennan-Forster.

07:21.360 --> 07:23.280
This Habib Marwan...

07:23.360 --> 07:27.840
Do you believe melting down the reactors
was his endgame, or something else?

07:27.920 --> 07:31.200
As long as he's out there,
we have to assume it's not over.

07:31.280 --> 07:34.720
Erin, exactly where are we
on apprehending this man?

07:34.800 --> 07:38.240
All our resources are being
deployed to that end right now.

07:38.320 --> 07:41.760
I'll have more information
once I've been briefed by my staff.

07:41.840 --> 07:45.160
But we know Marwan's in Los Angeles,
and we will find him.

08:14.800 --> 08:20.040
" As Harris Barnes, Marwan worked at
McLennan-Forster for two years as engineer.

08:20.120 --> 08:23.800
His most recent project
was design and development of the override.

08:23.880 --> 08:26.760
- Before that?
- Here's the timeline we pieced together.

08:26.840 --> 08:31.120
He went to graduate school in England,
worked for a company outside London.

08:31.200 --> 08:34.440
It's not clear whether
he was radicalised there or before.

08:34.520 --> 08:38.000
The one thing we know is that
from the day he arrived in the US,

08:38.080 --> 08:40.760
everything he did was about today.

08:40.840 --> 08:42.840
What were his other duties?

08:42.919 --> 08:45.920
We don't know yet.
We're taking a first pass at his records.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.800
I'm looking into the possibility that he used
McLennan-Forster to recruit sleeper cells.

08:50.880 --> 08:55.720
That brings up another issue. We have over
80% of field personnel looking for Marwan.

08:55.800 --> 09:01.720
I'm just wondering if we shouldn't divert
part of that to try to root out these other cells.

09:05.400 --> 09:08.000
- Erin?
- I'm sorry. What was the question?

09:08.080 --> 09:12.080
Do you think we should
reduce the field load on Marwan?

09:16.240 --> 09:21.800
How about we take some people off Marwan,
but still keep a floor of 60% looking for him?

09:21.880 --> 09:24.160
Would that work?

09:24.240 --> 09:27.080
Yes. That would work.

09:27.160 --> 09:29.160
OK.

09:36.440 --> 09:39.520
- I want you to relocate personnel.
- Based on what?

09:39.600 --> 09:42.480
People who've come in
the last six hours work on Marwan.

09:42.560 --> 09:46.600
- I want alert people on him.
- Are we gonna ignore what just happened?

09:46.680 --> 09:48.840
- " What do you mean?
- Erin.

09:48.920 --> 09:51.160
She shouldn't be running this place.

09:51.240 --> 09:53.920
Her daughter died a few minutes ago.
Give her time.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.200
Time? Edgar, since when
did we have the luxury of time?

09:57.280 --> 09:59.960
- She knows what's at stake here.
- You're right.

10:00.040 --> 10:04.480
We don't have time. We have work to do.
It does not include deciding Erin's fate.

10:04.560 --> 10:09.360
- I think we have to tell Secretary Heller.
- No, we don't. Not yet. Let's get back on it.

10:27.360 --> 10:30.760
- " Hey. Where are you?"
- Curtis and I just arrived at CTU.

10:30.840 --> 10:34.640
Listen, get a security detail,
go back to the hotel and get some rest.

10:34.720 --> 10:37.280
Jack, I can't leave.
My father needs my help.

10:37.360 --> 10:40.520
- Are you at McLennan-Forster yet?
- Almost.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.760
Jack, can you make me a promise?

10:42.840 --> 10:45.600
- What?
- Take care of Paul.

10:47.600 --> 10:50.320
He's not like you.

10:51.680 --> 10:56.080
Please, Jack, promise me
that you will look after him.

10:57.080 --> 10:59.520
- Yeah, I will.
- Thank you.

11:00.960 --> 11:04.600
- Yeah, OK. I'll talk to you later.
- All right. Bye.

11:12.120 --> 11:14.120
Look, uh...

11:16.440 --> 11:18.960
I don't resent you.

11:19.040 --> 11:22.120
Well, I wouldn't blame you if you did.

11:23.960 --> 11:26.120
No, uh...

11:26.200 --> 11:31.240
You didn't steal my wife.
We were separated. That's fair.

11:31.320 --> 11:35.520
But I'm not gonna let you take her from me.

11:35.600 --> 11:38.520
I don't think that's really up to you.

11:38.600 --> 11:40.680
- Or me.
- No, maybe it isn't.

11:41.920 --> 11:45.760
But she still has feelings for me,
I can hear it in her voice.

11:45.840 --> 11:48.160
I'll fight to keep those feelings alive.

11:48.240 --> 11:53.040
Well, Paul, you're gonna
have to do what you gotta do.

12:05.760 --> 12:10.240
None of our field agents at the Rockland
building have picked up a thread on Marwan.

12:10.320 --> 12:12.320
It looks like he might have escaped.

12:12.400 --> 12:16.480
So I think we have to assume
he's going to activate these sleeper cells.

12:16.560 --> 12:20.040
I agree. He'll most likely
launch a strike right away,

12:20.120 --> 12:23.720
create fear that we're still vulnerable.

12:23.800 --> 12:27.680
You'll have to excuse me,
I'm not feeling very well.

12:28.760 --> 12:30.640
Erin!

12:31.640 --> 12:33.640
Sit down. You all right?

12:36.560 --> 12:39.880
- " Clinic."
- Get me medical. Erin needs assistance.

12:39.960 --> 12:43.200
No, I'm fine. I don't need anybody.

12:45.600 --> 12:49.880
I just got a little
light-headed for a second there.

12:51.360 --> 12:53.240
- Ms Driscoll...
- I don't need you here.

12:53.320 --> 12:55.640
I was dizzy, but... I feel better.

12:55.720 --> 12:59.880
Take a break. Get something to eat.
Take Ms Driscoll and get her some food.

12:59.960 --> 13:03.360
I can handle the situation here
while you rest. Come on.

13:03.440 --> 13:07.040
All right. It's probably a good idea.

13:16.080 --> 13:19.360
She's gonna need to be relieved of duty.

13:22.360 --> 13:27.800
Contact Division. Alert them to the situation
and tell them to send someone.

13:27.880 --> 13:30.480
I ran this office for two years.

13:30.560 --> 13:34.640
I could take over for Erin
on a provisional basis.

13:34.720 --> 13:38.600
Forget for the moment
that you technically don't even work here.

13:38.680 --> 13:42.520
You've been away a while.
You're not fluent with the new systems.

13:42.600 --> 13:46.640
With all due respect, sir,
you don't need a programmer.

13:46.720 --> 13:49.720
You need a decision maker
who can stack up protocols.

13:49.800 --> 13:52.080
And you can do that?

13:52.160 --> 13:54.440
Yes, sir. I can.

13:55.840 --> 13:57.600
Fine. Effective immediately,

13:57.680 --> 14:02.880
you're the interim director
of CTU Los Angeles under my authority.

14:03.880 --> 14:10.400
I still want to contact District, have them
send someone on a more permanent basis.

14:10.480 --> 14:13.040
I understand, sir.

14:19.680 --> 14:22.360
Do you have the abstract
on McLennan-Forster?

14:22.440 --> 14:25.640
One second. I'm finishing it now.

14:26.480 --> 14:32.480
All right. McLennan-Forster was a principal
contractor in the design of the override.

14:32.560 --> 14:36.560
And Marwan, under the alias of Harris Barnes,

14:36.640 --> 14:40.400
had full security access on that project.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.840
You ran FBI checks on the others involved?

14:42.920 --> 14:45.600
Yes. They came up clean.

14:45.680 --> 14:49.960
We're dealing with a terrorist who had
inside access to a defence contractor.

14:50.040 --> 14:54.840
Actually, more than that. McLennan-Forster,
in addition to weapons manufacture,

14:54.920 --> 14:57.800
trains their clients to use those weapons.

14:57.880 --> 15:00.040
- International clients?
- Yes.

15:00.120 --> 15:03.680
Several countries in the Balkans,
Asia, and the Middle East.

15:03.760 --> 15:06.960
This is a messy situation.
When Jack gets to McLennan-Forster,

15:07.040 --> 15:10.880
he has to get into company records
and find out who Marwan dealt with.

15:10.960 --> 15:13.280
It's not gonna be that easy.

15:13.360 --> 15:17.800
This reflects on them. They'll be reluctant
to give incriminating information.

15:17.880 --> 15:21.360
Even if Marwan were the only guilty party.

15:26.960 --> 15:30.240
" Mr McLennan,
we need to talk before CTU gets here.

15:30.320 --> 15:33.240
- What's the problem?
- It was more than a coincidence

15:33.320 --> 15:39.200
that one of our products, the override, was
stolen and used in today's terrorist attack.

15:39.280 --> 15:42.400
What do you mean,
"more than a coincidence"?

15:42.480 --> 15:46.240
The entire operation,
from Secretary Heller's kidnapping

15:46.320 --> 15:52.800
to the meltdown of San Gabriel Island,
was organised by one of our own employees.

15:54.320 --> 15:57.280
- What are you talking about?
- One of our engineers,

15:57.360 --> 16:03.320
who we now know is a terrorist named Habib
Marwan, was running a covert organisation

16:03.400 --> 16:06.640
- from within our company.
- When did you find this out?

16:06.720 --> 16:10.800
Couple of minutes ago they called.
One of our employees, Harris Barnes,

16:10.880 --> 16:13.160
was actually Habib Marwan.

16:17.040 --> 16:21.480
- Who else knows about this?
- Just the two of us. And Conlon.

16:22.120 --> 16:25.680
Gentlemen. I'm David Conlon,
VP of internal security.

16:25.760 --> 16:28.200
Jack Bauer, with CTU.
This is Paul Raines.

16:28.280 --> 16:30.880
Jack, Paul. How can I help you?

16:30.960 --> 16:33.080
I need to speak with Gene McLennan.

16:33.160 --> 16:36.640
Gene's in a meeting right now,
and he asked me to assist you.

16:36.720 --> 16:40.400
- I have access to everything.
- My office didn't make itself clear.

16:40.480 --> 16:45.480
This is a matter of national security.
I need to speak with Mr McLennan now.

16:45.560 --> 16:48.640
I understand. Let me see what I can do.

16:56.080 --> 16:59.680
- What's the matter?
- Something's not right.

17:01.880 --> 17:06.599
John, I'm not gonna keep this a secret. We
have to let the government know right away.

17:06.680 --> 17:08.640
Sir! If you do this,

17:08.720 --> 17:13.000
it will, with 100% certainty,
be the end of this company.

17:13.079 --> 17:17.000
Now, you built McLennan-Forster.
Everything you have is tied up in it.

17:17.079 --> 17:22.000
If this comes out, you'll be synonymous
with what happened. Terrorism. Treason.

17:22.079 --> 17:24.760
What do you want me to do?
Lie to the government?

17:24.839 --> 17:29.480
If I knew 24 hours ago what I know now, I'd
have done whatever it took to stop the attack.

17:29.560 --> 17:33.280
But there's nothing we can do now.
Except protect ourselves.

17:33.360 --> 17:38.520
And keep this company from going under, as
it will if CTU find out the truth about Marwan.

17:38.600 --> 17:42.360
John, CTU will subpoena the file.
They will find out the truth.

17:42.440 --> 17:45.480
No, they won't, Gene. I promise you.

17:45.560 --> 17:48.240
Conlon and I can deal with this.

17:48.320 --> 17:50.240
If you let us.

17:53.720 --> 17:56.400
I don't like the sound of this.

17:56.480 --> 18:00.360
Mr McLennan, we implicitly
violated national security procedure.

18:00.440 --> 18:05.520
This could mean prison time.
We've got to protect ourselves.

18:07.720 --> 18:12.560
- Did you get the latest casualty figures?
- No, not yet.

18:12.640 --> 18:16.200
Which version of the Datalink
security system are you running?

18:16.280 --> 18:17.600
Excuse me?

18:17.680 --> 18:21.560
My company produces firmware
for Datalink. We installed your system.

18:21.640 --> 18:24.400
Are you at 3.4 or 3.5?

18:24.480 --> 18:26.880
Uh, 3.5. Does that work for you?

18:26.960 --> 18:29.240
Yeah. Thanks.

18:33.640 --> 18:37.480
Dave. Come on in.
John Reiss, chief technology officer.

18:37.560 --> 18:40.200
You helped us identify the override.
Jack Bauer.

18:40.280 --> 18:42.720
- It's good to meet you.
- I'm Gene McLennan.

18:42.800 --> 18:44.880
I'm, uh, sorry I was delayed.

18:44.960 --> 18:48.720
- Well, thank you for your time, sir.
- So how can I help CTU?

18:48.800 --> 18:52.320
One of your employees,
Harris Barnes, is actually Habib Marwan,

18:52.400 --> 18:56.160
a terrorist responsible for today's
attack and theft of the override.

18:56.240 --> 19:02.440
We need you to take your IT systems offline
so Paul can look into his directory.

19:03.440 --> 19:06.040
We can do that. Can't we, John?

19:06.120 --> 19:08.240
Absolutely. Uh, follow me.

19:10.800 --> 19:14.280
- " Thank you, sir.
- " Certainly.

20:00.560 --> 20:02.640
Maybe you should go home.

20:03.760 --> 20:06.240
I'm afraid to.

20:10.840 --> 20:15.080
When my wife, Susan, died,
I didn't deal with it at all.

20:16.080 --> 20:19.680
Actually, I went to work the next day.

20:19.760 --> 20:23.320
I remember thinking to myself, "That's life."

20:23.400 --> 20:28.360
"Quit feeling sorry for yourself,
get over it and get on with it."

20:29.160 --> 20:32.800
A few weeks later I answered
a call from an old friend of Susan's

20:32.880 --> 20:35.280
who did not know she had died.

20:37.640 --> 20:40.240
And when I heard myself saying:

20:41.920 --> 20:45.480
"Susan has passed away",

20:45.560 --> 20:49.480
when I actually said those words,

20:49.560 --> 20:51.880
it hit me.

20:51.960 --> 20:56.640
All the pain I was trying
to shut out just overwhelmed me.

20:58.520 --> 21:01.120
Erin, you can't keep it inside.

21:03.840 --> 21:09.600
You cry, you blame God, you blame yourself,
and then you cry some more.

21:10.600 --> 21:13.360
And all the while
you let your friends help you.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.440
It's pretty simple.

21:16.480 --> 21:18.960
But very painful.

21:19.040 --> 21:22.040
And I am so, so sorry for you.

21:23.280 --> 21:25.480
" Dad, I just wanted... Oh.

21:25.560 --> 21:27.920
Um... Uh, I'm sorry. I...

21:28.840 --> 21:32.000
I just wanted to let you know that I was back.

21:38.600 --> 21:40.840
I will go home.

21:40.920 --> 21:44.800
You should go
and make sure your daughter's OK.

21:49.040 --> 21:52.320
If you need me, I'll be on the floor.

22:00.840 --> 22:04.320
Excuse me, sir. Tony just told me
you put him in charge of CTU?

22:04.400 --> 22:06.280
That's correct.

22:06.360 --> 22:10.280
That doesn't make sense. He just got
reinstated, I'm second in command.

22:10.360 --> 22:13.320
Tony had Erin's job.
He has experience running CTU.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.440
- You don't.
- With all due respect...

22:15.520 --> 22:19.080
Relax, Curtis. It's provisional,
till District finds someone.

22:19.160 --> 22:21.400
For the record, I don't like it.

22:22.960 --> 22:27.720
- What do you hear from Bauer?
- He just arrived at McLennan-Forster.

22:27.800 --> 22:29.840
He'll call if he picks up any threads.

22:36.040 --> 22:38.760
OK, that was Marwan's
work station in the corner.

22:38.840 --> 22:41.760
His computer is tied
into the engineering subnet.

22:41.840 --> 22:45.800
What about the rest of the network?
Can we get into it from his account?

22:45.880 --> 22:48.960
Yeah, I think there's a way to do that.

23:03.360 --> 23:08.680
One window shows you his system files,
the other gets you outside the subnet.

23:08.760 --> 23:10.200
Thanks.

23:10.280 --> 23:13.160
Let me know if you need anything.

23:13.240 --> 23:15.240
" Thanks for your help.

23:22.800 --> 23:26.000
This guy looks like
he knows his way around our system.

23:26.080 --> 23:31.120
Don't worry. I'll be able to control things
from here. He won't find a thing.

23:31.760 --> 23:34.160
Marwan purged a lot of files.

23:35.400 --> 23:38.320
- When?
- Deletion dates aren't coming up.

23:38.400 --> 23:41.680
That means they could
have been deleted today.

23:41.760 --> 23:45.480
Marwan wasn't here today.
He was at Rockland, with the override.

23:45.560 --> 23:48.760
Maybe someone else deleted the files.

23:50.280 --> 23:52.560
There.

23:52.640 --> 23:55.040
All right. Let me see what I can find.

24:00.080 --> 24:02.320
- Yeah?
- I had to open up a socket for him.

24:02.400 --> 24:05.600
- I can see it.
- Are they gonna be able to find anything?

24:05.680 --> 24:11.040
As long as I can stay ahead of him, I should
be able to delete the incriminating files.

24:11.120 --> 24:13.200
All right. I'm coming up.

24:13.280 --> 24:16.320
What if you can't stay ahead of him?
What happens then?

24:16.400 --> 24:18.920
- There are other options.
- What options?

24:19.000 --> 24:21.760
We'll set off an EMP.

24:21.840 --> 24:24.840
A pulse bomb?
Are you out of your mind?

24:27.120 --> 24:31.840
It'll destroy every piece of hardware we have.
It'll cripple us electronically.

24:31.920 --> 24:33.920
That's the point.

24:48.360 --> 24:51.320
This is the handover sequence for comm.

24:51.400 --> 24:54.240
I left the default password in place.

24:54.320 --> 24:59.120
- You can reset it as soon as we're done here.
- All right.

24:59.200 --> 25:02.800
Here are all the access codes
to CTU and Division.

25:03.960 --> 25:09.040
- Thanks.
- If any of my personal stuff gets in your way,

25:09.120 --> 25:11.840
have someone box them
and put them into storage.

25:11.920 --> 25:13.680
All right.

25:29.880 --> 25:33.120
If you need anything, ask Curtis.

25:33.760 --> 25:38.440
And if he can't help you,
you can always call me at home.

25:38.520 --> 25:40.120
Thanks.

26:23.280 --> 26:27.160
" Could I have
everybody's attention, please?

26:27.240 --> 26:30.680
By now, you know that
I've taken over Erin Driscoll's command,

26:30.760 --> 26:32.760
on a purely provisional basis.

26:32.840 --> 26:34.840
All protocols remain the same.

26:34.920 --> 26:38.920
But I want updates from
all department heads every 15 minutes.

26:39.000 --> 26:43.240
Other than that, I'm just here to support you.

26:43.320 --> 26:45.320
So let's get back to work.

26:47.800 --> 26:51.120
- Hear from Jack?
- They're looking through Marwan's files.

26:51.200 --> 26:53.400
- Any promising leads?
- Nothing yet.

26:53.480 --> 27:00.120
Right. Look, Edgar, before Erin left she told
me the one person I should rely on is you.

27:01.240 --> 27:03.680
- She said that?
- Yes, she did.

27:04.760 --> 27:09.240
So anything you think is important,
I want you to bring it to me directly. Right?

27:09.320 --> 27:11.800
- You got it.
- All right. Thanks.

27:14.720 --> 27:18.440
Have you scanned satellite imagery
around the Rockland building?

27:18.520 --> 27:22.000
- Everything since the override takedown.
- All right.

27:22.080 --> 27:24.960
I want you to try
different frequency channels.

27:25.040 --> 27:28.320
- Manually?
- Yeah. Only way we can be sure to see it all.

27:28.400 --> 27:32.440
I'll have to talk to Tony.
I'm supposed to be backing up Jack and Paul.

27:32.520 --> 27:35.240
Put somebody else on that.
This is more important.

27:35.320 --> 27:37.400
What's more important?

27:37.480 --> 27:40.200
We've got 75% of our people
on McLennan-Forster.

27:40.280 --> 27:44.960
- I need Edgar to find a thread on Marwan.
- No, we don't have much chance by satellite.

27:45.040 --> 27:48.480
Our best chance is through those files.
Stay on that.

27:48.560 --> 27:54.200
- We can't afford one security-grade analyst?
- One, but not Edgar. Put somebody else on it.

27:54.280 --> 27:56.080
Tony.

27:57.080 --> 28:01.480
Are we trying to accomplish the same thing?
Or is this you establishing position?

28:01.560 --> 28:04.880
I don't have to establish position.
I've already got it.

28:04.960 --> 28:09.120
Now, what do you say we stop
wasting time arm-wrestling here?

28:09.200 --> 28:14.080
I respect your opinion. But we'll disagree,
and when we do, we're gonna do it my way.

28:14.160 --> 28:17.760
Fine. But I suggest you put manpower
into a data search for Marwan.

28:17.840 --> 28:22.720
All right. Grab a couple people from image
processing. Work the satellites with them.

28:22.800 --> 28:24.800
Curtis.

28:29.120 --> 28:32.600
Don't worry. I'm gonna be
out of here when this crisis is over.

28:32.680 --> 28:35.040
In the meantime,
I want the same thing you do.

28:35.120 --> 28:38.560
I want to find Habib Marwan. All right?

29:07.040 --> 29:09.960
Is everything all right?
I heard you had a problem.

29:10.040 --> 29:15.480
CTU got to the override before
the other nuclear plants melted down.

29:15.560 --> 29:17.760
Well, at least you're safe.

29:17.840 --> 29:23.760
For now. But they know who I am. They'll
be tracking me with everything they've got.

29:23.840 --> 29:27.840
- How does that affect our scheduling?
- It doesn't. Stay on task.

29:27.920 --> 29:31.160
Make sure everything
at the Air Force base is ready.

29:31.240 --> 29:34.240
I checked in with everyone
as of ten minutes ago.

29:34.320 --> 29:37.120
We're gonna make this thing happen, Habib.

29:37.200 --> 29:41.000
Now, remember. When you're done,
get in touch with Prado.

29:41.080 --> 29:43.280
He'll get you out of the country.

29:43.360 --> 29:45.360
And you?

30:04.080 --> 30:06.080
Go.

30:32.360 --> 30:34.640
- Good.
- What?

30:35.520 --> 30:38.840
I can rebuild the files
from these empty directories.

30:48.840 --> 30:50.640
- Dammit!
- What's he doing?

30:50.720 --> 30:53.440
He's trying to rebuild the files I deleted.

30:53.520 --> 30:56.040
- How can he do that?
- I don't know.

30:56.120 --> 31:00.160
It's not a documented function.
Must be some hook left in by the designer.

31:00.240 --> 31:03.440
He's gonna find evidence
we sold arms to terrorists.

31:03.520 --> 31:05.440
Not necessarily.

31:05.520 --> 31:09.080
The pulse bomb. We have to use it now.

31:23.080 --> 31:24.880
- Research.
- " Set it off.

31:24.960 --> 31:27.800
- We weren't scheduled for a test.
- This isn't a test.

31:27.880 --> 31:30.680
Open up the safety chamber
and set it off now.

31:30.760 --> 31:33.280
CTU will know
we're trying to hide something.

31:33.360 --> 31:36.240
Marwan's the suspect.
They'll assume he was behind it.

31:36.320 --> 31:40.560
- And the damage to the infrastructure?
- Better than destroying the company.

31:40.640 --> 31:43.200
It'll take some time, but we can rebuild.

32:14.760 --> 32:18.120
- Yeah?
- " EMP's been activated. Shield's open."

32:18.200 --> 32:20.320
OK. Good.

32:20.400 --> 32:26.400
It's been activated. It'll take
ten minutes to charge up before its release.

32:50.000 --> 32:54.000
Edgar? The phone taps you asked for
at McLennan-Forster aren't holding.

32:54.080 --> 32:57.320
- What do you mean?
- Connection keeps drifting.

32:57.400 --> 33:03.280
- Is there a problem on our end?
- Check power supply. Could be their PBX.

33:06.200 --> 33:09.960
My God, look at this thing.
The amplitude is fluctuating like crazy.

33:10.040 --> 33:13.560
- I thought you checked that before?
- I did. It was fine then.

33:13.640 --> 33:16.160
Let me call Jack.

33:16.240 --> 33:18.360
The cellular customer is out of range.

33:18.440 --> 33:21.040
That's weird. Customer out of range?

33:22.920 --> 33:25.320
- "McLennan-Forster."
- I need Jack Bauer.

33:25.400 --> 33:27.920
He's a CTU agent in Harris Barnes' office.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.040
I'll transfer you...

33:30.120 --> 33:31.440
Hello?

33:31.520 --> 33:34.200
- Hello?
- What's going on?

33:34.280 --> 33:37.240
Cell and land lines around
McLennan-Forster are out.

33:37.320 --> 33:40.400
Can we use the network to message him?

33:41.440 --> 33:48.000
- Yeah, the computers haven't been affected.
- Open up a window for me, would you?

33:57.880 --> 33:59.760
What the hell's this?

33:59.840 --> 34:02.360
" I don't know.

34:09.440 --> 34:14.040
Something's wrong. I gotta respond. Can you
pipe that window over to this computer?

34:14.120 --> 34:16.920
Yeah, just give me an Ethernet address.

34:18.920 --> 34:21.880
6EFF 3239.

34:35.239 --> 34:37.719
I've almost got these files rebuilt.

34:41.280 --> 34:45.159
- Do we have any data points outside?
- I'm online with the phone company.

34:45.239 --> 34:51.280
They're getting complaints as far as
eight blocks away from the building.

34:53.520 --> 34:58.400
- Have you still got a connection?
- Yeah, I've got it. Look at this.

34:58.480 --> 35:03.600
Son of a bitch, it's encrypted.
That's it. Print it out, now. Now!

35:07.480 --> 35:10.680
- Dammit! They've got something.
- What?

35:11.200 --> 35:13.560
I can't read it. How long till it goes off?

35:13.640 --> 35:16.120
- Any second. We're fine.
- He's printing it.

35:16.200 --> 35:19.360
- What are you going to do now?
- Take care of it.

35:20.120 --> 35:22.880
I don't believe this.

35:33.280 --> 35:35.400
We're dealing with an EMP.

35:35.480 --> 35:39.440
McLennan-Forster were developing
a nonlethal weapon for the military.

35:39.520 --> 35:42.080
- What is it?
- An electromagnetic pulse bomb.

35:42.160 --> 35:46.640
Once it goes off, everything
within its radius that's electrical gets fried.

35:46.720 --> 35:51.480
Lights, cars, computers. Every piece
of electronic datajust vanishes forever.

35:51.560 --> 35:53.640
- How long have we got?
- I don't know.

35:53.720 --> 35:56.360
Its capacitors are still charging.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.200
Come on.

35:59.280 --> 36:02.520
All right, the printer's warming up.

36:14.640 --> 36:18.360
Sarah, do we have any choppers in that area?

36:18.440 --> 36:20.240
Yeah, one.

36:20.320 --> 36:24.760
If it's in the air when the EMP goes off,
that chopper's going down.

36:24.840 --> 36:26.640
Get 'em out of the area now.

36:26.720 --> 36:30.000
- Edgar, where's this coming from?
- McLennan-Forster.

36:30.080 --> 36:32.840
CTU 3, do you hear me?

36:32.920 --> 36:35.080
CTU 3, do you copy?

36:36.520 --> 36:39.800
All right. This is coming through.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.800
OK, I'm gonna try and stop it.

36:45.880 --> 36:49.320
If I don't, take the hard copy,
meet me in front of the building.

36:52.560 --> 36:55.800
Dave, Bauer ran out.
He must have found out about the EMP.

36:55.880 --> 36:59.520
CTU agent's heading down towards you.
Don't let him near it.

36:59.600 --> 37:01.680
Mr Conlon. Is everything all right?

37:01.760 --> 37:05.480
As you can see, we're having
some problems with the electricity.

37:05.560 --> 37:07.840
Jack just went to check it out.

37:07.920 --> 37:10.160
- I saw you were printing.
- How'd you know?

37:10.240 --> 37:15.400
Well, we were searching the system same
time you were. Trying to help you guys out.

37:15.480 --> 37:18.800
- Mind if I take a look?
- Sure.

37:19.880 --> 37:22.360
It's, uh, just in the printer.

38:02.040 --> 38:05.040
Conlon, this is Barnet. Do you copy?

38:06.960 --> 38:09.120
- Yeah.
- "Two's clear. Moving to three."

38:09.200 --> 38:11.200
All right.

38:52.920 --> 38:55.240
Oh, my God.

39:15.360 --> 39:17.600
It's not gonna stop.

39:55.680 --> 39:59.400
" You got nowhere to go, man.
The doors are locked.

39:59.480 --> 40:01.320
Where's the printout?

40:06.080 --> 40:07.920
Where is it?

40:11.000 --> 40:13.400
Come on.

40:23.160 --> 40:26.200
- One of our choppers is down.
- Send medical in now.

40:26.280 --> 40:32.680
Call all field teams outside the perimeter
of the blast. We have to find Jack and Paul.

40:34.240 --> 40:37.040
I'll get back to you. OK. All right.

40:37.120 --> 40:40.520
Someone set off an EMP blast
in the McLennan-Forster building.

40:40.600 --> 40:42.760
We believe Jack and Paul are inside.

40:42.840 --> 40:47.360
I assume that's a response to us. Someone
doesn't want us to get Marwan's files.

40:47.440 --> 40:52.320
Jack was able to pull some info before
the blast. But we don't know who set it off.

40:52.400 --> 40:56.240
Excuse me, sir.
Ms Driscoll's replacement arrived.

40:56.320 --> 40:58.800
Thank you.

40:58.880 --> 41:01.400
- That was fast.
- We got lucky.

41:01.480 --> 41:07.040
Division had someone available with
the qualifications and CTU experience.

41:07.120 --> 41:09.680
- I understand.
- Tony, thank you for filling in.

41:09.760 --> 41:13.120
And I'd like you to stick around
and assist Ms Dessler.

41:13.200 --> 41:15.320
I'm sorry, who?

41:15.400 --> 41:17.920
Michelle Dessler. Do you know her?

41:25.800 --> 41:28.000
I used to be married to her.
