22:01.152 --> 22:02.523
-Demand drop-off?!

22:02.548 --> 22:04.075
-Become a buyer!

22:04.100 --> 22:05.722
(exclaims)

22:05.944 --> 22:07.358
(pops, yells)

22:09.794 --> 22:10.723
-Huh?!

22:10.748 --> 22:12.744
-It's okay,
Bob, it's okay!

22:13.001 --> 22:14.610
They're on our
side, now.

22:14.635 --> 22:15.563
-Our side?!

22:15.588 --> 22:17.519
What do you mean, our side?
How did--

22:17.544 --> 22:18.536
Dot...?

22:18.916 --> 22:20.455
-DOT: I have
hundreds of clients

22:20.480 --> 22:21.540
who would pay premium

22:21.565 --> 22:23.926
for inter-system transport
of your calibre,

22:23.951 --> 22:25.551
for a percentage,
of course.

22:25.576 --> 22:27.069
-Of course!

22:27.101 --> 22:29.459
Ah, do tell me more,

22:29.484 --> 22:31.656
Admiral Matrix.

22:32.043 --> 22:33.957
-Please, Captain
Capacitor.

22:33.982 --> 22:35.124
Call me Dot.

22:35.276 --> 22:36.487
(chuckles)

22:36.512 --> 22:39.034
Actually, my
name's Gavin.

22:39.675 --> 22:40.792
-Did she...

22:40.817 --> 22:41.862
with her...

22:41.887 --> 22:44.315
And now they're going
into business together?

22:44.340 --> 22:45.548
-Major.

22:45.687 --> 22:47.492
-Well, blow me down.
