WEBVTT

00:01.686 --> 00:03.061
- You ready?
- Oh, yeah, girl..

00:03.085 --> 00:04.453
Let's see those moves.

00:10.157 --> 00:11.349
Okay, girl. You do you.

00:12.413 --> 00:13.522
Priyanka, up.

00:15.538 --> 00:16.566
- Ah!
- Watch this.

00:16.591 --> 00:17.591
Two.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.396
Oh! Oh!

00:20.421 --> 00:21.421
Seven.

00:24.056 --> 00:25.056
Four. Yes.

00:25.081 --> 00:26.431
Oh, ho!

00:27.002 --> 00:28.002
Up.

00:29.530 --> 00:32.031
Wow! That was incredible.

00:32.066 --> 00:34.235
- Yeah.
- This chicken is ready.

00:34.822 --> 00:35.936
♪ Di-dee-dee ♪

00:35.969 --> 00:37.072
- Hi.
- Hey.

00:37.097 --> 00:38.337
- We are from Maggie's Farm...
- Yeah.

00:38.362 --> 00:41.184
... and we have the best hen
in the whole damn county.

00:41.209 --> 00:43.353
- I think it's... yeah.
- And I am so proud of you.

00:43.377 --> 00:44.778
I love you.

00:44.812 --> 00:46.447
Mm.

00:46.480 --> 00:47.954
Mm.

00:48.572 --> 00:50.551
Okay, most people just call, though.

00:50.584 --> 00:52.861
But I'm glad you came down.

00:56.423 --> 00:59.994

01:00.361 --> 01:04.062
Her full name is Priyanka.
Levine. Hyphen. Young.

01:04.087 --> 01:06.179
Maggie's... Farm's... Hen.

01:06.204 --> 01:08.376
Is it weird to say that
I'm more excited about this

01:08.401 --> 01:10.468
than anything ever in my entire life?

01:10.493 --> 01:12.250
Are you kidding? This blows
our wedding out of the water.

01:12.275 --> 01:13.275
Right?

01:13.503 --> 01:14.515
Look at all these events.

01:14.540 --> 01:16.877
I know. "Polka," "Best Hog."

01:16.910 --> 01:18.554
Ooh. "The Wife Carry"?

01:18.579 --> 01:19.947
What is a wife carry?

01:19.980 --> 01:21.415
That seems kind of problematic.

01:21.449 --> 01:23.959
It is. At the end,
the wife stands on a scale,

01:23.984 --> 01:25.728
and then the husband
wins her weight in beer.

01:26.007 --> 01:27.087
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

01:27.121 --> 01:28.289
They put you on a seesaw,

01:28.322 --> 01:29.766
and then they put the
beer at the other end.

01:30.101 --> 01:31.289
But that's the silly events.

01:31.314 --> 01:32.801
Now, the farm ones, like "Best Hen"...

01:32.826 --> 01:33.968
- Yeah?
- ... that gets heated.

01:33.993 --> 01:36.177
Three days of farmers battling it out

01:36.202 --> 01:37.566
for county-wide supremacy.

01:37.600 --> 01:38.641
- Yeah.
- Total war.

01:38.666 --> 01:40.000
Blue ribbon or death.

01:40.033 --> 01:43.058
- Destroy. Dominate. Conquer.
- Carnage.

01:43.083 --> 01:44.238
Take... Ooh. Hang on one sec.

01:44.263 --> 01:45.339
What is it?

01:45.457 --> 01:47.490
- I got to go. Scrapbooking.
- Oh, oh, right now?

01:47.515 --> 01:48.761
Um, can you give
Priyanka her bubble bath?

01:48.786 --> 01:50.543
- Can you?
- Oh, yeah. I'll give her a little treat

01:50.568 --> 01:52.615
before she crushes dreams.

01:54.067 --> 01:55.435
I still haven't told Beau

01:55.460 --> 01:57.083
about our scrapbooking sessions.

01:57.170 --> 01:59.154
The only thing that scares Beau more

01:59.179 --> 02:00.919
than talking about his own feelings

02:00.944 --> 02:04.005
is when I talk about my
feelings with someone else.

02:04.030 --> 02:05.443
- Right.
- Oh, and dots.

02:05.891 --> 02:07.899
Seeing a bunch of dots
really weirds him out.

02:07.924 --> 02:11.297
Interesting. So, in our
last scrapbooking session,

02:11.322 --> 02:12.672
you mentioned that you were gonna

02:12.697 --> 02:14.141
- write a letter to Beau.
- Yeah.

02:14.166 --> 02:15.297
We weren't gonna give it to him.

02:15.322 --> 02:16.578
- It was just an exercise.
- Yes.

02:16.603 --> 02:18.547
And then you did give it to him.

02:18.572 --> 02:20.133
- I did.
- How did that go?

02:20.166 --> 02:21.414
- It did not go well.
- Okay.

02:21.439 --> 02:23.867
I was gonna use "I feel"
statements like you said.

02:23.892 --> 02:25.869
- Yeah.
- But then he suddenly remembered

02:25.894 --> 02:27.690
that he had something to do in the barn.

02:27.903 --> 02:29.643
And then he stayed out there all night.

02:29.668 --> 02:31.674
So I just watched "SVU" all by myself.

02:31.699 --> 02:32.705
To tell you the truth, it was nice

02:32.730 --> 02:34.557
not have all those dumb questions.

02:34.582 --> 02:36.604
"Who's that? Is that the killer?"

02:36.629 --> 02:38.268
Well, I don't know, Beau, okay?

02:38.293 --> 02:40.346
You and I have the
same exact information.

02:40.371 --> 02:41.916
Well, he can't avoid you forever, right?

02:41.941 --> 02:44.730
I don't know. That barn's
got a cot, a fridge, a hot plate.

02:44.755 --> 02:47.636
If he could get football and
dirty websites on his phone,

02:47.797 --> 02:49.534
he could be out there
for three to four months.

02:49.559 --> 02:50.703
You know what that barn doesn't have?

02:51.009 --> 02:52.394
- Me?
- Okay.

02:54.220 --> 02:55.464
There you go. Let it out.

02:55.719 --> 02:56.792
Come here.

02:57.215 --> 02:59.003
He'll have to come back to the Kay well

02:59.912 --> 03:01.464
'cause he needs some Kay water.

03:01.489 --> 03:02.503
That's really good stuff.

03:04.098 --> 03:05.105
What'd I do without you?

03:06.949 --> 03:08.093
Do you need a flamingo sticker?

03:08.118 --> 03:09.276
I would like one. Thank you.

03:10.051 --> 03:12.823
Oh, let's get these talons sparkling.

03:12.848 --> 03:14.456
You're really giving that
bird the business, huh?

03:14.481 --> 03:15.958
You know, Priyanka's up for "Best Hen."

03:16.209 --> 03:17.271
If we get a blue ribbon...

03:17.637 --> 03:18.823
... it would turn everything around.

03:18.848 --> 03:20.326
That's a lot of
pressure for one chicken.

03:20.394 --> 03:21.769
Well, when we moved here,

03:21.794 --> 03:24.105
we really thought we were
gonna be farming the land.

03:24.130 --> 03:26.847
Then we got our ass kicked
with the soil and the weather,

03:26.872 --> 03:27.941
losing the tractor.

03:27.966 --> 03:29.769
Well, your wife has done a
hell of a job with that bird.

03:29.794 --> 03:30.800
Right, Priyanka?

03:30.825 --> 03:32.803
When she first came here,
Rio was totally helpless.

03:32.884 --> 03:35.339
I was sure one day I was gonna find
her dead at the bottom of a well.

03:35.364 --> 03:37.706
Each morning, I'd go over
there and cry out, "Rio."

03:38.586 --> 03:39.714
But she was never down there.

03:40.268 --> 03:42.105
Your wife... she's a strong woman.

03:42.130 --> 03:43.784
- She really is.
- Enough jibber jabber.

03:43.809 --> 03:44.917
I need your honest opinion.

03:45.268 --> 03:47.011
If you were Constance,
which pair of overalls

03:47.036 --> 03:48.042
would really get you going?

03:48.067 --> 03:49.987
I think I'd go with the
ones that were less stained.

03:50.012 --> 03:51.073
Come on, don't jerk me around.

03:51.098 --> 03:52.399
I need this date to go perfectly.

03:52.424 --> 03:54.456
Then, I guess wear the ones
that you're most comfortable in.

03:54.481 --> 03:57.083
Sorry. I'm all a-titter
about this date at the fair.

03:57.167 --> 03:58.792
Constance has lit a fire in my belly

03:58.817 --> 04:00.214
I haven't felt since Theresa left me.

04:00.272 --> 04:02.706
Oh, yeah, you've never
really told me about her.

04:02.731 --> 04:04.941
She left me for a pig farmer
a couple of towns over.

04:04.966 --> 04:06.944
I used to catch myself thinking
about her all the time...

04:07.096 --> 04:08.792
her kisses, sweet embrace,

04:08.840 --> 04:10.809
her heaving chest crying out in ecstasy.

04:12.445 --> 04:15.566
Okay, well, have fun, pal.

04:15.591 --> 04:17.226
Sounds like you're completely over her.

04:17.250 --> 04:18.253
Yeah, I am. I am.

04:20.584 --> 04:21.720
Hey!

04:21.745 --> 04:24.909
Ladies, get a load
of my county fair hat.

04:24.934 --> 04:27.175
When I wear this, I am B-A-D bad.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.644
Oh, I'll bet.

04:28.669 --> 04:30.433
Ooh! Sookie, sookie. Come on, now.

04:30.458 --> 04:31.683
Sorry. "Sookie, sookie"?

04:31.708 --> 04:33.714
- It's like, "Sookie, sookie!"
- Yeah. "Sookie, sookie!"

04:33.739 --> 04:35.605
- No.
- You think Rudy will like it?

04:35.630 --> 04:36.698
Yes. He's gonna love it.

04:36.723 --> 04:39.222
Don't you think he's
the most beautiful man

04:39.247 --> 04:40.253
in the world?

04:40.652 --> 04:41.862
- He is, uh...
- Well, he's...

04:41.887 --> 04:43.089
- very t... tall.
- He is, uh...

04:43.114 --> 04:44.777
He's a tall glass of buttermilk,

04:44.802 --> 04:46.581
and I'm planning on taking a sip.

04:46.606 --> 04:47.628
- Oh!
- Oh, my goodness!

04:47.653 --> 04:49.183
- Come on, now.
- Constance!

04:49.208 --> 04:51.106
It's the hat. I got
to take this thing off

04:51.131 --> 04:52.348
before it gets me into trouble.

04:52.373 --> 04:53.379
I got to take...

04:54.153 --> 04:55.153
Oh.

04:56.058 --> 04:57.074
Hi, Miss Rio.

04:57.099 --> 04:59.395
Hey, Jacob. Beau, how are you?

04:59.527 --> 05:01.122
You excited for your first fair?

05:01.147 --> 05:03.434
- I am, actually. I'm really excited.
- Yeah, me too.

05:03.503 --> 05:06.184
It's my last year competing
in the junior category, so...

05:06.209 --> 05:07.879
- Oh, cool.
- ... starting next year,

05:07.904 --> 05:10.262
in the eyes of the fair, at least, uh...

05:11.006 --> 05:12.006
I am a man.

05:12.490 --> 05:13.490
Cool. Well,

05:13.587 --> 05:16.110
listen, buddy, in my eyes,
you're already a man.

05:17.129 --> 05:18.129
Oop.

05:20.791 --> 05:22.094
I have to go outside now.

05:23.613 --> 05:24.614
Okay.

05:25.984 --> 05:27.540
- Kay, um...
- Hmm?

05:27.565 --> 05:28.833
... what are you doing here?
I thought you were,

05:28.858 --> 05:29.947
 uh, quilting over at Clara's?

05:32.007 --> 05:33.275
The jig is up.

05:33.645 --> 05:35.400
I've been scrapbooking with Rio.

05:37.527 --> 05:38.861
Why don't I have eyes?

05:39.226 --> 05:40.940
Wha... What's going on here?

05:40.965 --> 05:41.971
You want the truth?

05:42.215 --> 05:45.088
Rio and I have been meeting
and talking about my life

05:45.113 --> 05:46.135
for a while now.

05:46.160 --> 05:47.959
Her advice has been really helpful.

05:47.984 --> 05:49.963
- Thank you.
- Oh, yeah? What kind of advice?

05:50.046 --> 05:52.088
Putting diapers on the
photo of a grown man?

05:52.113 --> 05:53.775
I'm sorry. It's highly unethical for me

05:53.800 --> 05:56.182
to engage with you
regarding the scrapbooking

05:56.207 --> 05:58.518
that may or may not
be occurring currently.

05:58.543 --> 06:01.166
Beau, I wouldn't have to talk to
someone else about our marriage

06:01.191 --> 06:02.527
if you didn't say "uh-oh"

06:02.552 --> 06:05.021
- every time I said, "I feel."
- There you go.

06:09.083 --> 06:11.361
Dots, Kay?

06:12.507 --> 06:13.541
Dots?

06:18.720 --> 06:20.387
I feel like you wanted him to find that.

06:20.412 --> 06:21.525
I did. Is that bad?

06:21.550 --> 06:23.369
We should probably talk
about that next week.

06:27.215 --> 06:28.611
- Constance?
- Mm.

06:28.761 --> 06:29.910
If I may be so bold,

06:30.742 --> 06:32.410
you look absolutely stunning today.

06:32.435 --> 06:33.692
Well, thank you.

06:33.717 --> 06:34.787
I like your overalls.

06:34.812 --> 06:36.919
- That stain looks like a heart.
- Oh, it's rust.

06:37.012 --> 06:38.318
Mike said to wear clean ones,

06:38.343 --> 06:39.655
but I think he was just
having fun with me.

06:41.453 --> 06:43.194
Well, that makes two of us,

06:43.219 --> 06:45.421
because I'm having so
much fun with you now.

06:45.446 --> 06:46.452
Well, that makes three of us,

06:46.477 --> 06:48.147
'cause I'm fun and you're fun, and...

06:48.522 --> 06:50.491
Damn it. I can't think straight.

06:50.516 --> 06:52.093
- I'm all a-titter.
- Just breathe,

06:52.344 --> 06:53.968
and let all your titters out.

06:54.026 --> 06:55.361
No, it's you, Constance.

06:56.272 --> 06:57.811
You make me feel like I can't breathe,

06:57.836 --> 06:59.725
like my heart is skipping beats,

06:59.750 --> 07:01.445
like I'm about to die,

07:01.720 --> 07:03.273
but it's sublime.

07:03.969 --> 07:05.453
I haven't felt this good since...

07:07.523 --> 07:08.530
Rudy?

07:08.697 --> 07:10.478
I thought that was you.

07:10.978 --> 07:12.789
- Hello, Theresa.
- Hello.

07:12.814 --> 07:14.711
Oh, Theresa, you... you look great.

07:14.736 --> 07:15.790
Aw, thanks.

07:16.376 --> 07:17.477
And you look...

07:18.064 --> 07:19.400
you look good.

07:19.702 --> 07:21.562
So, it's been a long time.

07:21.587 --> 07:23.422
And I've heard some disturbing rumors

07:23.447 --> 07:26.273
that you built an underground bunker

07:26.298 --> 07:27.734
for the apocalypse?

07:27.759 --> 07:29.027
Yes, but it only sleeps two.

07:29.052 --> 07:30.351
So good luck out there, Theresa.

07:30.376 --> 07:31.377
And I always thought

07:31.402 --> 07:33.570
that we'd be fighting
the zombies together.

07:33.595 --> 07:34.595
So did I.

07:38.130 --> 07:40.414
Well, uh, you all enjoying the fair?

07:41.375 --> 07:44.235
Yes. We are enjoying it very much.

07:45.935 --> 07:47.328
Constance is my date.

07:47.728 --> 07:49.263
She makes me feel dead.

07:49.335 --> 07:50.937
Something you could never do.

07:53.424 --> 07:56.039
Well, the dog says hi.

07:59.815 --> 08:00.962
Are you okay?

08:01.191 --> 08:02.367
Think you need a minute?

08:03.101 --> 08:04.532
The only minute I need is this minute

08:04.557 --> 08:05.922
to let you know I don't need a minute.

08:06.525 --> 08:08.227
Let's go get you sculpted in butter.

08:08.252 --> 08:09.299
Come on.

08:09.618 --> 08:10.618
What?

08:10.783 --> 08:11.914
There you go, little lady.

08:11.939 --> 08:12.977
Oh.

08:13.195 --> 08:14.617
- Hi.
- The princess is here.

08:14.642 --> 08:15.711
Hey, everyone.

08:15.736 --> 08:17.781
What do you think we
should call her fans?

08:18.010 --> 08:20.045
Should we call them, like, Priyonkers

08:20.070 --> 08:22.351
- or, like, Beak babies?
- Oh, I like that.

08:22.376 --> 08:23.554
Ah, yeah, it's... Um, whoa,
whoa, whoa, no, no, no.

08:23.579 --> 08:25.117
Spectators, you sit over there.

08:25.321 --> 08:27.351
- Oh, no, we're competing, Kent.
- I know.

08:27.376 --> 08:28.898
It was just a little
friendly trash talk.

08:28.923 --> 08:30.149
- Oh!
- Oh.

08:30.174 --> 08:32.164
"Ha! Your bird stinks."

08:32.190 --> 08:33.673
Oh, that's good.

08:33.698 --> 08:36.039
I've met hay bales with more
charisma than that thing.

08:36.065 --> 08:37.466
- Yeah.
- Okay, that's good.

08:37.491 --> 08:38.828
Yeah, alright. My turn.

08:38.889 --> 08:39.990
Hey, is that your hen,

08:40.015 --> 08:42.102
or did your grandson suddenly turn cute?

08:42.445 --> 08:44.008
We showed you his picture.

08:44.089 --> 08:45.190
Boom.

08:45.394 --> 08:46.422
- Ouch.
- Teach him to roll up

08:46.447 --> 08:48.583
on some New Yorkers
with that weak sauce.

08:48.608 --> 08:50.055
You walked right up to the line.

08:50.080 --> 08:51.719
- Right?
- Maybe a little over it. Hey.

08:51.744 --> 08:52.774
Good morning, neighbors.

08:52.799 --> 08:54.649
I'm surprised you have time to compete,

08:54.674 --> 08:56.063
given all the time you spend

08:56.088 --> 08:57.985
trying to turn my wife against me.

08:58.010 --> 08:59.399
Beau, I cannot discuss anything

08:59.424 --> 09:00.876
that goes on between me and my patient.

09:00.901 --> 09:02.383
Your wife has been doing

09:02.408 --> 09:04.579
some scrapbooking
therapy stuff with Kay.

09:04.604 --> 09:05.610
- Ah.
- Well...

09:05.635 --> 09:08.096
20 perfect years of marriage,
and then she goes,

09:08.121 --> 09:10.150
"Oh, let's now look below the surface."

09:10.175 --> 09:13.181
Can you please remove your negative
energy away from this space?

09:13.206 --> 09:14.875
Because Priyanka's about to get judged.

09:14.900 --> 09:15.900
Well...

09:16.580 --> 09:18.595
I am the judge.

09:18.620 --> 09:20.189
When I heard you guys were competing,

09:20.214 --> 09:21.939
I gave up my "Best Hog" post

09:21.964 --> 09:24.072
so we could spend some
quality time together.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.463
This is gonna be fun.

09:26.163 --> 09:28.111
And hens to their marks!

09:30.033 --> 09:33.064
I'm sure he'll be... unbiased.

09:33.189 --> 09:34.213
I don't think so.

09:34.355 --> 09:35.486
Priyanka, up.

09:36.319 --> 09:37.322
Priyanka, up.

09:37.347 --> 09:39.215
Up, Priyanka. Ah, ah, up.

09:39.240 --> 09:40.955
- She's... She's feeling my energy.
- No, no.

09:40.980 --> 09:41.994
- Hey, hey, hey. No, okay.
- She doesn't know that...

09:42.019 --> 09:43.130
You got this, okay? Okay.

09:43.276 --> 09:44.651
Think about where you've come from.

09:45.017 --> 09:46.339
You were born on the mean streets

09:46.364 --> 09:47.440
of the Upper West Side.

09:47.465 --> 09:48.894
Now you're standing here
in front of all these folks

09:48.919 --> 09:50.530
about to win your first
chicken competition

09:50.555 --> 09:52.753
in the 10th biggest
county in eastern Nebraska.

09:52.825 --> 09:55.347
Not to mention, you have
never fallen in a well.

09:55.372 --> 09:56.964
I don't give myself
enough credit for that.

09:56.989 --> 10:00.921
Since we moved here, every day,
I have been amazed by you.

10:01.355 --> 10:03.323
- You can do this.
- Okay.

10:03.583 --> 10:05.218
I love you. You're the best.

10:05.438 --> 10:06.639
Okay. Okay.

10:06.664 --> 10:07.796
Time to dance.

10:09.127 --> 10:10.127
Priyanka, up.

10:11.642 --> 10:12.642
Oh!

10:12.801 --> 10:14.408
Whoo! Whoo!

10:14.627 --> 10:16.140
Where my Priyonkers is at?

10:16.165 --> 10:17.445
Where my Priyonkers is at?

10:17.470 --> 10:19.155
Come on. Put your hands up!

10:19.180 --> 10:21.180
What! Put your... No?
No one's doing it.

10:21.205 --> 10:22.658
- I'm gonna take a quick lap.
- You know what? Take a lap...

10:22.683 --> 10:24.448
and just like, get it 
out of your system.

10:26.650 --> 10:29.876
And the final chicken in 
the "Best Hen" competition

10:29.901 --> 10:31.259
is from Maggie's Farm.

10:31.284 --> 10:32.337
Let's have a look.

10:34.000 --> 10:40.074

10:43.289 --> 10:45.744
Oh, ow! Disqualified. She pecked me.

10:45.769 --> 10:46.790
- No. Beau...
- Dis...

10:46.815 --> 10:48.120
- That is... That is not...
- Disqualified.

10:48.145 --> 10:49.815
- No! My ass!
- Hey! Show me where.

10:49.840 --> 10:50.950
- There. Right there.
- She did not.

10:50.975 --> 10:52.129
And this is how I like them.

10:52.154 --> 10:54.284
- One, two, three.
- No, no, no, no.

10:54.309 --> 10:56.535
That's it. The competition is over.

10:56.560 --> 10:57.770
Great. So you guys are just fine

10:57.795 --> 10:59.160
with this blatant corruption?

10:59.185 --> 11:00.527
Beau, you are better than this.

11:00.552 --> 11:02.687
You cried on my shoulder.

11:03.053 --> 11:04.191
I don't know what you're talking about.

11:04.216 --> 11:05.715
Oh, shove it, Beau.

11:05.740 --> 11:07.957
You are the worst
neighbor we have ever had,

11:07.982 --> 11:09.293
and the people above us in New York

11:09.318 --> 11:11.720
- ran a musical school for children.
- It's over.

11:11.745 --> 11:13.520
They're judging fruit
pies here in 10 minutes.

11:13.647 --> 11:15.482
- Clear out.
- This ain't over.

11:15.507 --> 11:17.243
You took a blue ribbon from us,

11:17.268 --> 11:18.722
- we take one from you.
- Yep.

11:18.747 --> 11:20.840
You name the event, we're there.

11:20.865 --> 11:21.918
The wife-carry.

11:21.943 --> 11:23.762
You name any other event,

11:23.787 --> 11:25.613
- and we will be there.
- Any of them.

11:25.638 --> 11:26.887
The wife-carry.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.291
Whoo!

11:32.475 --> 11:34.090
I always thought that
seeing Theresa again

11:34.115 --> 11:35.941
would make me crumble, but, Constance...

11:37.142 --> 11:39.434
... you make me feel like an
unbreakable block of granite.

11:39.647 --> 11:41.950
Like Mount Rushmore
but with fewer heads.

11:42.100 --> 11:43.965
I'm so glad you didn't crumble,

11:44.835 --> 11:48.176
because I... I want
you all in one piece.

11:48.306 --> 11:49.926
Go easy on this old horse.

11:51.974 --> 11:53.145
Beep beep. Coming through.

11:53.170 --> 11:54.262
Damn you, Clara.

11:55.341 --> 11:57.684
Clara, it's okay. You didn't
do anything wrong, girl.

11:57.920 --> 11:58.920
Sorry.

11:59.142 --> 12:00.919
Will you be attending
the square dance tomorrow?

12:01.288 --> 12:02.288
I might.

12:02.313 --> 12:03.739
Then I will be attending as well.

12:03.811 --> 12:07.364
So we'll be there at the s-same time.

12:07.467 --> 12:09.654
If you're there between the hours
of 4:00 and 6:00, then yes.

12:09.679 --> 12:11.576
Well, I'll put on my dancing boots.

12:14.085 --> 12:15.795
Are you sure you don't want
to buy any cotton candy?

12:15.820 --> 12:17.131
- It's for ch...
- Go, Clara! Get out of here!

12:17.156 --> 12:18.615
I will never forgive you!

12:19.303 --> 12:20.303
Sorry.

12:21.835 --> 12:25.201
So this is the World
Wife-Carrying Competition...

12:25.226 --> 12:26.794
- Okay.
- ... in Sonkajarvi, Finland.

12:26.819 --> 12:28.679
Whoa. What is that wife up to?

12:28.704 --> 12:30.851
This is called The Estonian Method.

12:30.876 --> 12:32.405
Now, all the locals around here,

12:32.430 --> 12:34.804
they're mostly gonna be using
that simple backpack hold.

12:34.829 --> 12:36.186
This will give us an edge.

12:36.422 --> 12:37.554
Look at Priyanka.

12:37.579 --> 12:39.507
She's thirsty for revenge.

12:40.563 --> 12:45.116
Husband, carry me like the
Estonian wife that I am.

12:46.711 --> 12:48.140
So, limber up first. Limber up.

12:48.165 --> 12:50.467
There's a way for us to just... Ow. Ow.

12:50.492 --> 12:52.351
I think if I started
here. Oh! Are you okay?

12:52.376 --> 12:53.390
Get down on the ground,

12:53.415 --> 12:54.811
- I'll get into position.
- Oh.

12:54.836 --> 12:57.397
- Spin around. 180, honey, 180.
- Honey, I'm doing it.

12:57.422 --> 12:58.468
Come on. Just roll.

12:58.848 --> 13:00.452
Is this something? Here it is.

13:00.477 --> 13:01.843
Like, if I do this...

13:01.868 --> 13:03.045
- Right.
- Oh, right. That's great.

13:03.070 --> 13:04.163
And then I'll, like, stand.

13:04.188 --> 13:05.188
Yeah, and then...

13:07.056 --> 13:08.056
Hi.

13:10.299 --> 13:11.767
Oh, No, no, no, no, we got
to focus. We got to focus.

13:11.792 --> 13:12.892
We got to keep our heads in the game.

13:12.917 --> 13:13.931
- Yeah.
- Defeat.

13:13.956 --> 13:15.525
- Dominate. Destroy.
- Yes.

13:15.550 --> 13:17.319
- Blue ribbon.
- Oh, my gosh. Yeah.

13:18.025 --> 13:19.614
On second thought, let's just do it

13:19.639 --> 13:21.115
- and get it out of the way.
- Yeah, just 'cause we don't want it

13:21.140 --> 13:22.382
to happen tomorrow
in front of the crowd.

13:22.407 --> 13:23.444
And just like...

13:27.979 --> 13:31.487
Alright, all wife-carry
competitors to your marks.

13:31.512 --> 13:32.995
The wi-fi in the barn went out

13:33.020 --> 13:34.409
about midnight last night.

13:34.686 --> 13:36.753
Why did you need wi-fi after midnight?

13:37.230 --> 13:38.230
Barn stuff.

13:38.255 --> 13:39.700
- Coming through, coming through.
- Go time.

13:40.459 --> 13:41.827
Well, I'll be.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.503
I didn't think you'd show up.

13:44.545 --> 13:45.545
- Excuse us.
- Last call.

13:45.570 --> 13:46.718
Racers to your marks.

13:47.881 --> 13:49.231
- Yep.
- What in the...

13:49.256 --> 13:50.535
- Ha!
- Ohh.

13:50.715 --> 13:52.324
Breathe through your mouth,
baby, not your nose.

13:52.349 --> 13:54.098
- Got it.
- This is a family event.

13:54.123 --> 13:56.020
We get it, you're newlyweds.

13:56.045 --> 13:57.216
- You surprised, Beau?
- Oh, my God.

13:57.241 --> 13:58.622
It's called The Estonian Method.

13:58.734 --> 14:00.325
And when you're staring
at the back of my thighs

14:00.350 --> 14:01.520
and my wife's inverted back,

14:01.545 --> 14:03.864
I want you to think of
one thing... Priyanka.

14:03.889 --> 14:05.317
Why would he think about your chicken?

14:05.342 --> 14:06.622
Why don't you ask your husband?

14:06.647 --> 14:07.647
What was that?

14:09.584 --> 14:11.615
I said... I said, why
don't you ask your husband?

14:12.792 --> 14:13.842
What did you do to their hen?

14:13.867 --> 14:15.769
They're just salty
'cause I disqualified her.

14:15.794 --> 14:16.928
You ready?  Hop on.

14:16.953 --> 14:19.623
That hen was the one thing they had

14:19.648 --> 14:21.146
on their sad, dilapidated farm.

14:21.171 --> 14:23.140
- And you took it away out of spite.
- Yep.

14:23.795 --> 14:25.201
- On your marks...
- Hop on. We'll talk about it later.

14:25.226 --> 14:26.505
No, no. We're talking about it now.

14:26.537 --> 14:27.538
Get set...

14:30.088 --> 14:32.656
You can't tune me out when
I'm this close to your ear.

14:35.019 --> 14:37.256
Now come together in groups of eight.

14:37.281 --> 14:39.150
Go to your left and don't be late.

14:40.672 --> 14:42.672
Doing this from day to morn,

14:42.697 --> 14:45.047
come tomorrow, husk that corn.

14:45.618 --> 14:47.899
Well, hello, there.

14:47.924 --> 14:49.070
Oh, Theresa, hello.

14:49.232 --> 14:51.235
We haven't seen each
other in over a decade,

14:51.260 --> 14:52.795
and now it's twice in two days.

14:52.933 --> 14:54.383
You were always good with numbers.

14:55.026 --> 14:58.453
Hey, remember when we last
square danced together?

14:58.692 --> 15:00.031
It was at my nephew's wedding,

15:00.056 --> 15:02.203
and I wore white because
I hated the bride.

15:03.108 --> 15:06.727
So, Rudolph Enoch Longfellow,

15:07.462 --> 15:08.963
will you dance with me again?

15:08.988 --> 15:10.456
I'm waiting for Constance.

15:10.481 --> 15:12.445
Oh, she can have your heart.

15:12.941 --> 15:14.391
I'm just asking for your body.

15:15.041 --> 15:16.041
Okay.

15:16.066 --> 15:18.485
Now roll away to a half-sashay.

15:19.427 --> 15:21.649
Then come together and play!

15:23.664 --> 15:25.867
Promenade with heel and toe!

15:25.892 --> 15:27.672
Swing your partner high and low!

15:27.697 --> 15:28.865
Whoo-hoo!

15:31.116 --> 15:32.397
Big finish.

15:33.448 --> 15:34.582
Yee-haw!

15:39.749 --> 15:41.774
Ace of diamonds, jack of spades.

15:41.799 --> 15:44.188
Get together, promenade.

15:46.994 --> 15:48.305
Ohh! Watch the head.

15:48.330 --> 15:50.633
- You're doing great, babe.
- Yeah, Rio!

15:50.699 --> 15:52.234
It's me, Jacob!

15:52.259 --> 15:54.250
I feel that you shut me out emotionally.

15:54.275 --> 15:56.328
I feel that you hide behind your work.

15:56.353 --> 15:57.735
I feel that I would like to try

15:57.760 --> 15:59.086
one of those sideways positions.

15:59.111 --> 16:01.274
I get it. Ease up on the neck a little.

16:02.431 --> 16:03.632
Ohh! Ohh!

16:03.657 --> 16:05.117
I... I can't see where I'm going.

16:05.142 --> 16:06.680
All I see is butt.

16:07.001 --> 16:08.001
Oh, God.

16:09.181 --> 16:10.526
Wait, what? What'd I just hit?

16:10.694 --> 16:12.346
Go left! Don't stop!

16:12.371 --> 16:13.893
I can't see, but I trust you.

16:13.918 --> 16:15.520
Brakes, brakes, brakes! Aah!

16:20.905 --> 16:22.424
- My bad.
- I'm sorry.

16:26.926 --> 16:28.494
- Honey.
- Yeah?

16:28.704 --> 16:30.322
I feel like we got too competitive

16:30.347 --> 16:32.111
with the whole county fair thing.

16:32.136 --> 16:34.408
Yeah. Everyone hates us, for sure.

16:35.893 --> 16:39.416
- I feel like I let Aunt Maggie down.
- What?

16:39.441 --> 16:41.135
Well, you know, she left me this farm,

16:41.160 --> 16:43.401
and I... and I just... I
wanted to make her proud.

16:43.426 --> 16:44.426
Mike...

16:45.712 --> 16:48.448
Aunt Maggie left you
this farm with dead soil,

16:48.473 --> 16:51.728
and you figured out a way
to bring it back to life

16:51.753 --> 16:54.063
and to make it our home.

16:54.450 --> 16:56.657
And for that, I think
she'd be damn proud.

16:57.384 --> 16:58.649
I mean, I know I am.

17:01.013 --> 17:02.247
Oh, my gosh.

17:02.604 --> 17:03.634
What?

17:03.659 --> 17:04.829
Do you remember what we thought

17:04.854 --> 17:06.367
living on a farm was gonna be like?

17:07.189 --> 17:09.031
Oh, my God, were we wrong.

17:09.057 --> 17:10.088
Oops.

17:10.113 --> 17:13.986
I envisioned myself,
like, sitting on a porch,

17:14.257 --> 17:17.292
drinking lemonade,
listening to wind chimes.

17:17.318 --> 17:18.387
I thought I'd always have, like,

17:18.413 --> 17:19.801
a piece of straw
hanging out of my mouth.

17:19.827 --> 17:21.092
- You know, take a lot of naps...
- Yeah.

17:21.117 --> 17:22.694
- ... with my hat over my face.
- Sure. Classic.

17:22.719 --> 17:23.719
Here we are.

17:23.743 --> 17:25.608
A bunch of patches of clover coming up,

17:25.633 --> 17:26.935
chicken tractor, and...

17:28.204 --> 17:30.182
a good-sized column of smoke.

17:31.161 --> 17:32.291
That's, uh...

17:32.739 --> 17:34.007
Oh, my God, Mike.

17:34.032 --> 17:35.697
Oh, that's coming
from the Bowmans' farm.

17:46.846 --> 17:49.018
Constance, can we talk?

17:51.651 --> 17:53.549
Honey, it keeps going
to Connie's voicemail.

17:55.340 --> 17:56.862
We got to get the animals out of here.

17:56.887 --> 17:58.260
Even the cows?

17:58.360 --> 18:00.471
Yes, even the cows, hon!

18:00.496 --> 18:02.632
- It's only cows!
- I was just checking.

18:02.977 --> 18:04.172
Yeah, I'm scared, too.

18:07.713 --> 18:08.867
Shut up and let me save your life,

18:08.892 --> 18:10.160
or I'll keep...

18:10.185 --> 18:12.103
Oh, are you licking me?
Oh, that's so scratchy.

18:12.128 --> 18:13.864
Oh, God. There's gratitude.

18:15.853 --> 18:18.017
You and Theresa are quite the pair.

18:18.042 --> 18:20.345
She is... was a big part of my life.

18:20.793 --> 18:22.587
We have towels with
our initials on them.

18:25.498 --> 18:26.743
It's hard to move on.

18:27.175 --> 18:28.751
Every time you think you have,

18:28.776 --> 18:31.142
you... you see that there's
a lot more moving to do.

18:32.982 --> 18:35.009
I think we just took
on too much too soon.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.470
Maybe we should just slow down.

18:37.787 --> 18:40.103
There's a reason molasses is so sweet.

18:43.075 --> 18:46.407
Constance, would you dance with me?

18:52.987 --> 18:54.355
And...

19:00.060 --> 19:02.138
There's a fire at the 
Bowmans', come on, let's go!

19:02.655 --> 19:04.001
Sorry, there's a real fire.

19:04.133 --> 19:05.665
I've been calling the
square dance all day.

19:17.926 --> 19:19.376
What the hell are you doing in there?!

19:19.487 --> 19:20.755
Saving your barn.

19:20.780 --> 19:23.618
You fought that fire?
Just the two of you?

19:23.643 --> 19:25.040
We lost Rio, didn't we?

19:25.196 --> 19:26.532
My 4H cows.

19:26.997 --> 19:27.997
Are they...

19:28.537 --> 19:29.618
Yeah, they're fine.

19:29.643 --> 19:30.892
Except this one likes to lick,

19:30.917 --> 19:32.103
and it's freaking me out.

19:32.128 --> 19:33.251
Oh, my God.

19:33.276 --> 19:34.532
- Please take these cows.
- Yeah. Yeah.

19:34.557 --> 19:36.056
Thank you two. Seriously.

19:37.535 --> 19:38.618
Yeah, thanks.

19:38.759 --> 19:41.382
Thanks for not standing by
and letting our barn burn down

19:41.407 --> 19:42.688
like a couple psychos.

19:42.713 --> 19:43.814
You're welcome, Beau.

19:43.839 --> 19:44.938
It's what neighbors do.

19:45.090 --> 19:46.899
Maggie would be so proud of you

19:46.924 --> 19:48.091
for what you did here.

19:48.150 --> 19:49.150
Thank you.

19:49.751 --> 19:52.132
- How can we repay you?
- Oh, please, you know, just

19:52.157 --> 19:53.774
- being able to help out's enough...
- Yeah, it feels good.

19:53.799 --> 19:55.360
- ... for us.
- I can give you your tractor back.

19:55.385 --> 19:56.399
- Yes, we will take that.
- Absolutely.

19:56.424 --> 19:57.672
Sounds like overkill.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.797
How about a nice, crisp $20?

19:59.822 --> 20:01.079
Just give them the damn tractor.

20:01.104 --> 20:02.430
Fine. It... It's yours.

20:02.455 --> 20:04.172
- We're back to square one!
- We can plant again!

20:04.197 --> 20:05.599
Oh! We did it!

20:30.509 --> 20:31.509
Ahh!

20:34.735 --> 20:36.555
- Beau's here, honey.
- Hmm?

20:36.882 --> 20:38.024
Morning, neighbors.

20:38.375 --> 20:40.579
Kay and I had an in-depth conversation

20:40.604 --> 20:41.782
about her feelings,

20:41.807 --> 20:43.360
so I thought I'd drop
by and let you know

20:43.385 --> 20:45.766
how much I appreciate you
trying to help our marriage...

20:45.859 --> 20:47.961
Oh, that makes me feel so happy.

20:47.986 --> 20:50.243
... but she kicked me out
is the end of that sentence.

20:50.306 --> 20:52.516
- What?
- Kay kicked me out.

20:54.829 --> 20:55.829
So...

20:58.868 --> 21:00.290
I figured I'd crash here

21:00.315 --> 21:02.251
until you guys put this fire out, too.

21:02.774 --> 21:04.211
- Uh...
- Thanks, neighbors.

21:05.316 --> 21:06.501
Oh, uh...

21:06.854 --> 21:08.255
I sleep in the raw.

21:08.280 --> 21:09.954
So when you bring me
coffee in the morning,

21:10.466 --> 21:11.993
you might want to knock first.

21:16.817 --> 21:18.797
Hey, what time's supper?

21:22.316 --> 21:23.665
I'll cook on Tuesdays.
