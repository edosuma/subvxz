02:40.280 --> 02:42.880
I'm gonna kill you first

Did you see that hairy butt?

03:45.600 --> 03:46.880
Who did that?

04:08.600 --> 04:11.640
- Who wants a Mountain Dew?
- You said you didn't have any money.

04:11.720 --> 04:13.280
Yeah, well, last one there is a pedophile.

04:13.360 --> 04:16.600

You ain't catching him.

Hey, stop it.

06:29.720 --> 06:31.688
Come out here. All right, fuck you.

07:53.560 --> 07:54.560
- Right now.
- Now?

07:54.640 --> 07:55.721
Right now.

07:56.880 --> 07:58.160
What kind of dumbass are you,

07:58.240 --> 07:59.924
asking random girls
to go to Kansas with you?

08:00.040 --> 08:02.850
I don't know. It's a fucking job...

08:02.960 --> 08:05.088
You know what I mean?
This is a job, prop job...

08:05.920 --> 08:07.729
I can't even talk, man. You see?

08:07.840 --> 08:11.925
- What kind of job?
- It's a job, a business opportunity.

08:13.840 --> 08:14.887
Okay.

08:15.760 --> 08:19.240
We go door-to-door. We sell magazines
door-to-door, being friendly.

08:19.320 --> 08:22.120
You know, you seem friendly.
You make $300 a day if you're good.

08:22.200 --> 08:25.488
If you're smart. You seem pretty smart,
so figured I'd ask.

08:26.600 --> 08:29.729
Hmm? Come with us.

08:30.400 --> 08:32.129
You can't just give me a job like that.

08:32.240 --> 08:34.607
Yes, I fucking can.
I'm a business manager.

08:34.960 --> 08:37.600
Is that why you're wearing those pants?

08:37.679 --> 08:40.240
What the fuck's wrong with my pants?

08:40.320 --> 08:41.799
You don't like my pants?

08:41.880 --> 08:43.962
I don't know. You kinda look a little...

08:44.080 --> 08:45.640
Donald Trump-ish?

08:45.720 --> 08:47.480
You kinda look more like a gangster to me.

08:47.560 --> 08:49.640
- Really?
- Except for the sparkly phone.

08:49.720 --> 08:52.166
- That's part of it.
- Hmm.

09:05.080 --> 09:07.208
Come with us.

09:07.440 --> 09:09.360
We do more than work, you know.

09:09.440 --> 09:12.920
We explore, like, America. We party.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.720
A whole bunch of shit. It's cool.

09:17.280 --> 09:19.328
Hey, yo, Jake!

09:19.840 --> 09:23.731
- I think they want you.
- Everybody wants me.

09:24.640 --> 09:26.369
- Let's go, man.
- I don't.

09:27.520 --> 09:28.965
Yeah, you do.

09:29.640 --> 09:30.926
No, I don't.

09:32.040 --> 09:34.040
- Fuck, okay.
- Let's go.

09:34.120 --> 09:36.566
Come on, Jake.

09:37.320 --> 09:39.120
Last chance.

09:39.200 --> 09:41.726
- What's up, bro?
- Hey, last chance.

09:43.280 --> 09:45.408
Tomorrow morning. Motel 6.

09:47.240 --> 09:49.049
Star?

09:49.800 --> 09:51.404
Star!

10:16.240 --> 10:17.526
Shit.

10:40.960 --> 10:43.691
Is this the same chicken that lays eggs?

10:58.480 --> 11:01.211
- What you got there, honey?
- Give me a minute.

11:03.480 --> 11:04.891
I've been waiting.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.165
I'm so hungry I could eat a cow.

11:14.440 --> 11:17.320
This chicken don't have any eggs.

11:17.400 --> 11:20.210
Shut the fuck up, Rubin.
Get these dogs outta here.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.000
- No, give it.
- Come on, get them...

11:29.080 --> 11:31.680
Oh, I don't care. Come on.
Go get them dogs outta here.

11:31.760 --> 11:33.320
Let's go. Get them outta here.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.643
Go on, you can play.

11:58.360 --> 11:59.964
Here, go take these out to your brother.

12:00.680 --> 12:02.284
That one's for you.

12:08.280 --> 12:09.440
# I know your name

12:09.520 --> 12:10.931
# 'Cause everybody in here knows your name

12:11.040 --> 12:12.883
# And you're not looking
for anything right now

12:13.000 --> 12:16.368
# So I don't wanna come on strong

12:16.600 --> 12:20.160
# So don't get me wrong girl
your eyes are so...

12:20.240 --> 12:22.766
- Are you gonna eat it?
- What is it?

12:25.560 --> 12:27.449
You've got eyes.

12:27.600 --> 12:30.720
- Let me take that.
- I've got things to do.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.529
Come here and dance with Dad.

12:33.400 --> 12:37.530
Come on, now. It's just a dance. Come on.

12:39.880 --> 12:42.326
# I don't have to make you love me

12:42.800 --> 12:45.800
# I just wanna take your time

12:45.880 --> 12:48.880
# I don't wanna wreck your Friday

12:48.960 --> 12:51.760
# I ain't gonna waste my lines

12:51.840 --> 12:54.844
# I don't have to take your heart

12:54.960 --> 12:58.123
# I just wanna take your time

12:58.400 --> 12:59.960
# And I know it starts with hello

13:00.040 --> 13:02.120
# And the next thing you know
you're trying to be nice

13:02.200 --> 13:03.760
# And some guy's getting too close

13:03.840 --> 13:06.605
# Trying to pick you up

13:07.120 --> 13:10.010
# Trying to get you drunk

13:24.840 --> 13:27.207
# ...go to hell

14:05.120 --> 14:07.487
Throw my stuff out the window.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.523
I'll go with...

14:14.080 --> 14:18.449
He ain't tired. Hey, Timmie...

14:39.160 --> 14:40.446
Spider-Man!

14:47.520 --> 14:49.522
Have you seen my Spider-Man jump?

14:52.240 --> 14:54.242
Have you seen my Spider...

14:59.240 --> 15:01.641
- Where are we going?
- Shh. It's a surprise.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.968
A surprise.

15:14.200 --> 15:15.920
- Shh...
- Rubin.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.650
All right, Rubin, come on. Out.

15:19.320 --> 15:21.049
Come on, Rubin, out.

15:22.040 --> 15:23.326
Good.

15:25.840 --> 15:29.049
All right, go. Shh.

15:54.400 --> 15:58.360
What's all this mud? Ooh!

15:58.440 --> 16:01.205
Step in the water.

16:50.520 --> 16:52.363
I got a job.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.409
It's in Kansas.

16:58.400 --> 17:00.767
Did you come all the way here
to tell me that?

17:02.840 --> 17:05.684
What kind of fucking job
you got in Kansas?

17:07.040 --> 17:09.406
Nathan can't have them, you know that.

17:11.359 --> 17:13.362
I can't have them.

17:16.920 --> 17:18.523
Is that the surprise?

17:18.640 --> 17:21.160
I can't take you to Kansas. I'm sorry.

17:21.240 --> 17:22.651
Hey, what's going on?

17:24.040 --> 17:26.040
She wants us to have the kids

17:26.119 --> 17:28.520
because she's got a fucking job in Kansas.

17:28.600 --> 17:31.320
- They are yours.
- Fuck you, bitch.

17:31.400 --> 17:32.970
Settle down, both of y'all.

18:13.480 --> 18:15.847
I'm just gonna go
to the bathroom, all right?

18:18.720 --> 18:20.449
I'm going to the bathroom.

18:28.760 --> 18:31.161
Come on, Star!

18:32.520 --> 18:37.128
Star! Get the fuck back here!

19:07.840 --> 19:09.729
Come on, dog. Come on, dog.

19:09.840 --> 19:10.960
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

19:11.040 --> 19:13.320
- All right, y'all.
- Wait a second.

19:13.400 --> 19:14.400
Come on, man.

19:15.680 --> 19:17.880
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.

19:17.960 --> 19:19.400
Get it good. Come on, brother.

19:19.480 --> 19:22.131
Go on. Wait. Nah. Nah, nah.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.720
- Come on, dude.
- That second one didn't count, bro.

19:24.800 --> 19:26.880
Go, go, go. I'm letting you have it.

19:26.960 --> 19:28.086
I'm letting you have it.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.040
All right, fine, fine, fine.

19:35.120 --> 19:36.960
Watch out, watch out,
watch out, watch out.

19:37.040 --> 19:38.520
Watch out, watch out. You bitch.

19:38.600 --> 19:39.960
Watch out, watch out, watch out.

19:40.040 --> 19:41.246
Watch out.

19:42.120 --> 19:43.246
Oh, shit.

19:43.680 --> 19:45.360
Hey, you decided to come, yeah?

19:45.440 --> 19:47.360
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I figured you would.

19:47.440 --> 19:49.329
- Did you, now?
- Yeah.

19:49.800 --> 19:52.167
I mean, you like me, you know.
It's obvious.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.607
- You always this cocky?
- Yeah... Huh?

20:00.280 --> 20:02.520
- Yeah. You?
- Yeah.

20:06.360 --> 20:07.960
You're not part of this, bitch.

20:09.760 --> 20:11.091
Hey!

20:12.760 --> 20:14.205
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

20:16.200 --> 20:17.880
Can you stop fucking around and help me?

20:17.960 --> 20:19.166
Yeah.

20:20.400 --> 20:23.449
- You wanna go get the trunk?
- Here.

20:28.600 --> 20:29.681
Hey.

20:30.280 --> 20:31.520
Right here.

20:36.600 --> 20:39.400
- Are you coming with us?
- Yes, ma'am.

20:39.480 --> 20:41.528
You must be the little redneck Jake found.

20:43.840 --> 20:45.680
- What's your name?
- Star, ma'am.

20:45.760 --> 20:47.967
- That's your real name?
- Yes, ma'am.

20:50.920 --> 20:53.002
- How old are you?
- Eighteen.

20:54.120 --> 20:57.600
- So you're a grown woman now?
- Yeah, I guess.

20:57.680 --> 20:58.920
Open it, open it.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.040
- Where's that accent from?
- Texas.

21:01.120 --> 21:04.283
So you're a Southern girl.
A real American honey like me.

21:05.920 --> 21:07.331
You know that song?

21:08.680 --> 21:09.920
No.

21:12.760 --> 21:14.600
Get off, get off, get off, get off.

21:14.680 --> 21:16.444
You know how to work hard?

21:16.560 --> 21:18.767
Business is tough.
I only take hard workers.

21:18.880 --> 21:20.440
Shut the fuck up.

21:20.520 --> 21:21.726
Yeah, I can work hard.

21:22.560 --> 21:27.043
- Yo, get in there. Hey.
- Hey. What the fuck's going on?

21:27.160 --> 21:29.360
- We're getting in.
- Get in the car.

21:29.440 --> 21:30.885
That's what I'm doing.

21:36.760 --> 21:38.410
You got anyone who's gonna miss you?

21:39.960 --> 21:41.769
Not really.

21:41.880 --> 21:44.804
Okay, good. You're hired.

21:58.120 --> 22:00.122
There's a new girl!

22:04.360 --> 22:06.283
I guess she decided to show up.

22:10.560 --> 22:13.160
Now you gotta turn
and lick his collar grease.

22:14.760 --> 22:17.730
- Yo, it's Mary Jane.
- Y'all got that?

22:18.320 --> 22:21.200
- Hey, what's up? Are you new?
- Yeah.

22:21.280 --> 22:23.440
Yeah? You should let me be
the first one to fuck you.

22:23.520 --> 22:24.920
Hold up, hold up. Don't worry,

22:25.000 --> 22:26.840
he wouldn't know where to
fucking put it if you had it,

22:26.920 --> 22:28.000
'cause you're still a virgin.

22:28.080 --> 22:29.520
Man, I ain't no damn rookie,
and this is no damn toy.

22:29.600 --> 22:32.320
Corey pulled his dick out
in front of the new girl!

22:34.360 --> 22:36.362
You got me in the ass!

22:40.080 --> 22:42.200
- Get him!
- Get his ass!

22:42.280 --> 22:43.880
Get my shoe back.

22:43.960 --> 22:47.442
I'm sorry. My bad, y'all. Yo, my bad!

22:48.360 --> 22:50.200
We got his ass!

22:50.280 --> 22:52.160
Hey, you gotta learn to
leave the new girls alone.

22:52.240 --> 22:53.320
Don't worry, new girl.

22:53.400 --> 22:54.800
We do that all the time when he does that.

22:54.880 --> 22:56.520
Stop looking so damn nervous. Come on.

22:56.600 --> 22:59.524
- We're gonna have fun.
- Come on, new girl.

23:01.440 --> 23:03.568
I've been in my own world, dog.

23:03.800 --> 23:05.484
Y'all ready?

23:06.520 --> 23:08.602
Kansas City, here we come, bro.

23:09.720 --> 23:11.085
I smell something good.

23:12.360 --> 23:14.360
- A whole bunch of cigarettes.
- Fuck, no. It ain't pot.

23:14.440 --> 23:16.044
I smell something even better...

23:16.160 --> 23:18.845
- You want a shot?
- Thanks.

23:20.560 --> 23:23.360
Hell, yeah, you can just hit me back
when you got some.

23:23.440 --> 23:27.000
- What do we sell again?
- Magazines.

23:27.080 --> 23:29.840
- People actually buy those anymore?
- Fuck, no.

23:29.920 --> 23:32.480
- What happened to the music?
- Who has DJ control?

23:32.560 --> 23:34.040
I would say that too but... Hey!

23:36.680 --> 23:38.523
Hey! Hey!

23:44.000 --> 23:45.640
Yo, you act like we don't have a system.

23:45.720 --> 23:46.720
Turn that shit up!

24:41.800 --> 24:44.724
Hey, don't give me
that shit, man. I don't need it.

24:48.640 --> 24:49.971
Let me see you rap.

24:56.080 --> 24:59.120
She started stabbing everybody
in the restroom right there.

24:59.200 --> 25:01.920
Oh, damn. Oh, damn, she got a bird brain.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.206
A bird brain.

25:04.640 --> 25:06.000
All right, what's next?

25:06.080 --> 25:08.840
# You're a dumbass bitch
I ain't fuckin' with you

25:10.000 --> 25:11.161
Remember Jay-Z? No?

25:11.280 --> 25:14.000
- Yo, where are y'all from?
- Shit, nigga.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.760
All over.

25:15.840 --> 25:19.003
Krystal gets people from all over.
I'm from Panama.

25:19.360 --> 25:23.200
I'm QT. I'm from Panama City.
I'm the cutie of the crowd.

25:23.280 --> 25:24.360
Yeah!

25:24.440 --> 25:26.280
- What's up?
- I mean, she's the rider.

25:26.360 --> 25:29.360
Like, if you're friends with her,
she will make sure that you are fine.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.920
Regardless. Re-fucking-gardless.

25:32.240 --> 25:33.280
Yeah.

25:33.360 --> 25:35.800
And she's a fucking G.

25:35.880 --> 25:37.006

I'm JJ.

25:38.240 --> 25:41.880
I was born and raised in West Virginia,
and all these are my bitches.

25:41.960 --> 25:43.120
His name's GayGay.

25:43.200 --> 25:45.965
Hey, right here is Pagan.
She's from New Jersey.

25:46.640 --> 25:48.920

25:49.000 --> 25:51.526
Thank you. Thank you for interrupting me.

25:51.640 --> 25:53.722
You're welcome.

25:53.840 --> 25:56.764
My name is Austin, and I am from Florida.

25:57.080 --> 25:58.764
Orlando, Florida.

26:00.760 --> 26:03.400

and I'm from Tennessee, Nashville.

26:03.480 --> 26:04.720
He's the baby of the group.

26:04.800 --> 26:06.600
I got hit by a car when I was little.

26:06.680 --> 26:09.320
- I punched him in his shit.
- I'm so sorry.

26:09.400 --> 26:11.240
Hey, bro, you seen that dog?

26:15.400 --> 26:18.000
- He's so cute, ain't he?
- Poor little Runt.

26:18.080 --> 26:21.440
And this dude right here,
Billy he is our designated driver.

26:21.520 --> 26:24.080
He's an awesome dude,
and he lives in West Virginia.

26:24.160 --> 26:26.811
And this man can sing and play guitar.

26:28.640 --> 26:32.560
- Hey, I'm Sean. I'm from Texas.
- Texas? I'm from Texas, too.

26:32.640 --> 26:33.687
- Really?
- Yeah.

26:33.800 --> 26:35.802
- You wanna see something?
- Yeah.

26:39.080 --> 26:41.560
Holy shit. What is that?

26:41.640 --> 26:44.160
- It's a flying squirrel.
- And he carries a rat.

26:44.240 --> 26:45.760
He's chill.

26:47.320 --> 26:52.360
- Oh, yeah. That's so sick.
- Yeah, she might shit on you.

26:52.480 --> 26:54.562
- Hi.
- She fell out of a tree.

26:57.880 --> 27:00.406
- Her name is Sugar.
- Oh, yeah?

27:02.960 --> 27:04.000
Ow, shit...

27:04.080 --> 27:07.160
Fuck. Was I not doing it right?

27:07.240 --> 27:09.480
No, you gotta be gentle.

27:09.560 --> 27:12.120
Kal with the long blonde hair,
he's from Missouri.

27:12.200 --> 27:14.000
He really don't talk much about himself.

27:14.080 --> 27:20.800
He's scared of flies, moths, birds,
and damn near anything that flies.

27:20.880 --> 27:23.200
- Shut the fuck up.
- It's fucking crazy, man.

27:26.240 --> 27:30.165
- Corey, tell her where you're from.
- I'm Corey. I'm from Baltimore.

27:30.840 --> 27:34.320
- I'm Katness, and I'm from Miami.
- She got mean pole-dancing skills.

27:34.400 --> 27:37.000
Katness is so beautiful, loving, caring...

27:37.080 --> 27:40.129
I don't even know
what to say about that girl.

27:41.240 --> 27:44.483
So, I have this obsession
with Darth Vader.

27:44.720 --> 27:50.363
To me, he's just like the epitome
of just darkness and suffering.

27:50.480 --> 27:53.440
- Yeah.
- Um, and misunderstanding.

27:53.520 --> 27:55.960
Um, I feel like he was just a broken heart

27:56.040 --> 27:58.964
that lost any hope for love and life.

28:01.400 --> 28:03.760
What about Jake?
What about him? Where's he from?

28:03.840 --> 28:06.360
- He's from Bakersfield.
- Let me tell you something.

28:06.440 --> 28:10.200
This man, when it comes to his job,
he takes that shit serious, like.

28:10.280 --> 28:13.363
This dude can sell,
like anything and everything.

28:13.480 --> 28:15.280
You give it to him, he'll sell it.

28:15.360 --> 28:18.648
- Jake is a power agent.
- I don't know what the fuck he says.

28:18.800 --> 28:21.000
Maybe it's his personality, I'm thinking.

28:21.080 --> 28:24.840
He is Krystal's bitch, like super bad,

28:24.920 --> 28:27.680
and he has to drive her around everywhere.

28:27.760 --> 28:30.840
- She loves the ass...
- Meow!

28:32.960 --> 28:34.840
- A puppy in heat.
- Yeah, yeah.

28:34.920 --> 28:37.160
Hey, Billy, can we stop? I need to pee.

28:37.240 --> 28:38.960
Are we able to get us something to drink?

28:39.040 --> 28:41.520
Hey, can we just pull over
and go randomly milk a cow?

28:41.600 --> 28:44.560
Hey, there's water right on
the floor, man, right in front of you.

28:44.640 --> 28:47.200
I'm gonna piss in my seat
if you don't stop.

29:02.600 --> 29:04.364
We'd better go through
a fucking drive-through.

29:04.480 --> 29:06.050
Food, yeah.

29:12.680 --> 29:13.880
Is this of you selling?

29:13.960 --> 29:16.850
Yeah, we're at a Walmart
selling some shit.

29:18.000 --> 29:21.721
- So this is what I have to do?
- Yeah, sell magazines.

29:22.560 --> 29:24.720
You just gotta come up with
your own spiels and shit,

29:24.800 --> 29:26.840
like I use the whole,

29:26.920 --> 29:30.160
"Oh, my dad was killed
in Afghanistan" shit.

29:30.240 --> 29:31.840
Shit, was he?

29:31.920 --> 29:34.605
No, but, shit, people love
that patriotic shit.

29:35.560 --> 29:38.723
- Kansas City, y'all!
- Oh, shit. Kansas City.

29:38.880 --> 29:41.611
I never seen so many
tall things in my life.

29:42.920 --> 29:44.922
This is where Superman lives.

29:46.440 --> 29:49.400
- That bitch is fucking huge.
- Oh, hell, yeah, dude.

29:49.480 --> 29:51.801
- I wonder what those buildings are?
- It's a city.

29:51.920 --> 29:54.080
I know, but I wonder what
the bigger buildings are?

29:54.160 --> 29:57.687
Holy shit.
Look at those fucking buildings.

30:02.760 --> 30:04.840
Kansas City, baby!

30:04.920 --> 30:09.448
- Hell, yeah. Kansas.
- Wizard of Oz. Dorothy.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.844
I ain't never seen so damn
many train tracks in my life.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.080
Is this where we're staying?

30:17.160 --> 30:19.288
Yeah, this looks like where we're staying.

30:20.760 --> 30:22.125
It's about damn time.

30:23.720 --> 30:26.440
It only took, like, fucking forever.

30:26.520 --> 30:27.560
Is this the fucking place?

30:27.640 --> 30:29.800
It looks like
a fucking crack fucking motel.

30:29.880 --> 30:31.882
- Oh, fuck.
- Fucking bird.

30:33.480 --> 30:35.040
Look at this fucking place.

30:35.120 --> 30:37.202
There's kids right there,
watch your mouth.

30:37.640 --> 30:38.801
Pet the poochie.

30:39.920 --> 30:42.002
This is a sketchy-ass motel.

30:42.920 --> 30:45.400
It looks like you go up in
there and get a good staph infection...

30:48.880 --> 30:50.640
I'm excited.

30:50.720 --> 30:52.480
Hey, look, Krystal's car.

30:52.560 --> 30:54.200
Yeah, that's Krystal's car.

30:54.280 --> 30:57.250
- That's what her and Jake came in.
- Serious?

30:58.200 --> 30:59.804
- What the fuck, y'all?
- Damn, dude!

31:01.800 --> 31:03.120
Chill the fuck out.

31:03.200 --> 31:06.560
Fuck, man. That's some
bullshit. Get his fucking ass.

31:06.640 --> 31:08.800
The motherfucker can't drive, man.

31:08.880 --> 31:11.320
- Hey, hey, hey...
- Oh, my God.

31:11.400 --> 31:13.323
Star, wait up a second.

31:16.120 --> 31:19.329
Maybe we need to roll one up.

31:20.200 --> 31:22.120
Hey, get your girl. This is your blanket.

31:22.200 --> 31:24.080
Who the fuck are you talking to?

31:24.160 --> 31:25.520
- What's up with you?
- Hey.

31:25.600 --> 31:27.170
- Are you good?
- Yeah.

31:27.320 --> 31:29.800
All right, so this is
your welcome packet, yeah?

31:29.880 --> 31:31.920
So in there are the crew rules.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.800
You gotta memorize this shit
by tomorrow morning.

31:34.880 --> 31:38.885
Basically, you just, like, memorize
the first ten parts. It's quick.

31:39.040 --> 31:42.480
This is where all the magic happens.
This is your pad case.

31:42.560 --> 31:44.400
So it's got everything you need in there.

31:44.480 --> 31:47.640
I got your stickers and shit,
so you can decorate it however you want.

31:47.720 --> 31:49.720
- Stars.
- Yeah.

31:49.800 --> 31:51.802
Stars for Star.

31:52.880 --> 31:55.720
So your contract's in there.
You gotta get that signed by 7:30.

31:55.800 --> 31:58.640
You get it to Room 233 for Krystal.

31:58.720 --> 31:59.760
7:30?

31:59.840 --> 32:03.287
And Krystal's, like, she's a bitch
until she gets to know you, you know.

32:03.400 --> 32:06.520
But she's good people, you know? She is.

32:06.600 --> 32:09.126
It's just she doesn't know you,
you know. You're new.

32:10.440 --> 32:13.808
So... Oh, and, um, I got you a present.

32:16.600 --> 32:17.965
You got me a present?

32:18.080 --> 32:19.560
You don't have to
close your eyes or anything.

32:19.640 --> 32:22.484
You just gotta prove to me
your real name is Star.

32:24.520 --> 32:25.560
You're funny.

32:25.640 --> 32:28.928
Prove to me your name is Star,
and I'll give it to you.

32:29.600 --> 32:31.400
It was my mom's idea.

32:31.480 --> 32:34.723
She said we're all made from stars.
From Death Stars.

32:38.200 --> 32:39.361
Can I get my present?

32:40.080 --> 32:41.366
I made that.

32:41.840 --> 32:43.842
You got girly handwriting.

32:46.480 --> 32:48.482
You're a Death Star?

32:50.280 --> 32:52.009
Scared?

32:54.840 --> 32:55.841
Bang.

32:56.560 --> 32:58.240
What the fuck? What's up, G?

32:58.320 --> 33:00.400
You can't be doing that shit.
You came too close.

33:00.480 --> 33:03.000
- You came too close.
- Stop.

33:03.080 --> 33:04.360
And now you're stuck.

33:04.440 --> 33:06.040
- And now you're stuck.
- Stop.

33:06.120 --> 33:08.646
- And now you're stuck.
- Jake, stop.

33:11.880 --> 33:13.086
Okay.

33:13.240 --> 33:16.480
"Be on time for all meetings,
curfews and pick-ups.

33:16.560 --> 33:19.200
No males in female rooms.

33:19.280 --> 33:23.524
Dress for success.
Don't tell anyone where you're staying.

33:24.320 --> 33:27.085
Uh, "Do not talk to motel guests.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.760
Be on time for all meetings,
curfews and pick-ups.

33:32.840 --> 33:35.640
No males in female rooms.
Dress for success.

33:35.720 --> 33:37.400
Do not tell anyone where you're...

33:43.480 --> 33:46.404
They're gonna send us
to the spice mines of Kessell,

33:46.520 --> 33:48.520
and they'll fuck with us.

33:48.600 --> 33:50.602
They'll fuck with us.

33:56.360 --> 33:58.362
Hey, don't let her go on the road.

34:02.080 --> 34:04.003
Fuck...

34:05.640 --> 34:08.007
Goddamn world of Google.

34:08.159 --> 34:10.561
Fucking McDonald's poisonous shit.

34:21.800 --> 34:22.847
Fuck.

34:25.440 --> 34:27.090
Stay.

34:40.760 --> 34:42.409
You're late.

34:42.679 --> 34:44.364
I'm sorry. I...

34:46.679 --> 34:48.091
Shit.

34:58.840 --> 35:00.968
What's rule one?

35:01.400 --> 35:03.402
Don't be late for anything.

35:04.000 --> 35:07.240
Bitch, you don't make money,
I don't make money. You get it?

35:07.320 --> 35:10.449
I'm gonna let it slide this time
because it's your first day.

35:15.440 --> 35:19.240
You keep 20 percent of what you make,
25 if it's cash.

35:19.400 --> 35:22.400
- Always try and get cash.
- Okay.

35:22.480 --> 35:26.000
The rest is management fees,
goes to motels, gas.

35:26.080 --> 35:27.445
That's basically it.

35:30.120 --> 35:32.122
Jake'll train you.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.843
You like that idea?

35:38.760 --> 35:40.040
He's the best I got.

35:40.120 --> 35:42.088
He knows everything on how to make money.

35:43.760 --> 35:45.728
And what are we here for?

35:47.920 --> 35:49.251
To make money?

35:49.880 --> 35:51.325
Good.

35:54.040 --> 35:55.451
Hold on.

36:15.520 --> 36:18.330
Here's for food and things
till you start earning.

36:19.840 --> 36:21.360
Thanks. I'll pay you back.

36:21.440 --> 36:22.680
Damn straight.
This isn't no fucking charity.

36:22.760 --> 36:24.205
I'm gonna take it off your first paycheck.

36:26.240 --> 36:27.446
Okay.

36:29.760 --> 36:32.525
We have a crew meeting
at 8:00 in the parking lot.

36:47.640 --> 36:48.687
Where'd it go?

36:49.680 --> 36:51.967
Point at it. Point at it.

37:00.080 --> 37:03.720
Let's fucking bounce. K.C., K.C.!

37:45.680 --> 37:47.444
That's right. What's up?

39:00.200 --> 39:02.009
She looks just like she wants to fight.

39:04.160 --> 39:05.491
Nah, I'm good.

39:11.400 --> 39:13.004
You see the stickers Jake got me?

39:13.920 --> 39:16.240
- Hey, that's pretty.
- Yeah.

39:16.320 --> 39:19.360
He got me Princess Leia stickers
when I first got here.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.169
He got you stickers, too?

39:23.000 --> 39:24.240
Mmm-hmm.

39:29.280 --> 39:34.844
Yeah, I used to have them on here,
but the rain kind of washed them off.

39:38.880 --> 39:40.848
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey, shut that off.

39:42.320 --> 39:43.606
All right.

39:44.960 --> 39:46.480
Okay, listen up.

39:46.560 --> 39:49.480
Where y'all headed today
is real wealthy territory.

39:49.560 --> 39:51.440
I ain't tried this kind
of territory before,

39:51.520 --> 39:53.800
but these people are loaded
and it shouldn't be hard.

39:53.880 --> 39:56.880
- So what are there?
- No excuses.

39:56.960 --> 39:58.928
And with Loser Night
coming up in a few days,

39:59.040 --> 40:00.240
some of y'all need to step the fuck up.

40:00.320 --> 40:01.560
Step the fuck up.

40:01.640 --> 40:04.200
I said one, two, three, four, five.

40:04.280 --> 40:06.080
This loser ain't got no job.

40:06.160 --> 40:09.240
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Let's back it up and do it again.

40:09.320 --> 40:11.480
- Say I.
- Hey-o!

40:11.560 --> 40:13.280
- Got money.
- Got dough.

40:13.360 --> 40:17.280
I said shit, goddamn.
Get off your ass and slam.

40:17.360 --> 40:20.489
071, 071, 071!

40:21.760 --> 40:24.730
All right, get to work, you lazy fuckers.

40:24.880 --> 40:26.291
I'll tell you what.

40:26.400 --> 40:28.920
Ain't nobody coming to my fucking room
to take a shit again.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.280
You and Runt can go to
y'all room to take a shit.

40:31.360 --> 40:34.160
When I walked in the fucking
bathroom, there was a fucking cow patty.

40:34.240 --> 40:36.520
That wasn't me. I fell asleep.

40:36.600 --> 40:38.320
And there was
a little fucking Hershey kiss

40:38.400 --> 40:39.800
just floating in the toilet.

40:39.880 --> 40:42.850
I don't give a damn who takes a shit
in my room as long as you flush it.

40:42.960 --> 40:44.485
Febreze, though.

40:45.240 --> 40:48.160
If somebody comes over to my place I ask
them to use Febreze in my bathroom,

40:48.240 --> 40:50.641
so if you do take a shit, you better
spray and you better flush.

40:50.760 --> 40:54.200
I don't know. Everybody knew
my fucking toilet didn't work.

40:54.280 --> 40:55.691
Hey, Austin.

40:58.880 --> 41:00.680
What's Losers' Night?

41:00.760 --> 41:03.840
That's a fun motherfucking
night right there.

41:03.920 --> 41:07.840
Yeah, kinda, sort of.
It's a party practically.

41:07.920 --> 41:09.729
It's where the two losers of the week...

41:09.840 --> 41:12.241
- Whoever makes the least amount...
- Least amount of money.

41:12.360 --> 41:13.600
...has to fight each other.

41:13.680 --> 41:16.440
It's a game, but technically
it's not a game.

41:16.520 --> 41:18.720
- 'Cause they're physically fighting.
- It's like a tradition.

41:18.800 --> 41:20.165
They're putting their hands on each other.

41:20.280 --> 41:23.120
- Krystal kinda set that shit up.
- Y'all are fucked up.

41:23.200 --> 41:25.160
- It's stupid shit.
- It gives us something to do.

41:25.240 --> 41:26.844
When you're on the road most of your life,

41:26.960 --> 41:28.600
you need something to get some shit out.

41:28.680 --> 41:30.560
We gotta have something
to occupy ourselves.

41:30.640 --> 41:35.440
Like every time he whips his dick out,
we all jump on him? It's a game.

41:35.520 --> 41:37.249
We all have our little thing, you know.

41:37.360 --> 41:39.240
Like when the Rihanna song comes on,

41:39.320 --> 41:41.680
you know how, in Kmart,
we all, like, dropped.

41:41.760 --> 41:44.160
Yeah, it's stupid shit. It's bullshit.
We have fun.

41:44.240 --> 41:46.242
- It is tradition.
- I never lose.

41:46.360 --> 41:49.682
You know what Darth Vader
looks like inside his suit?

41:50.640 --> 41:52.480
No. What?

41:52.560 --> 41:57.043
He's a skeleton. Just like the rest of us.

41:59.440 --> 42:03.440
Look at the water fountain.
The fucking water fountain.

42:03.520 --> 42:04.640
I was laying down, right,

42:04.720 --> 42:08.600
and I seen these little fucking shadows
on the fucking ceiling dancing, dog.

42:08.680 --> 42:10.762
It's called acid, bro.

42:10.920 --> 42:12.960
Look at this fountain.
Look at this fountain.

42:13.040 --> 42:14.960
Look at this fountain.
Look at this fountain.

42:15.040 --> 42:17.800
- Holy shit.
- That's big.

42:17.880 --> 42:20.400
- This is a nice-ass neighborhood.
- Mission Hills.

42:20.480 --> 42:22.040
It's not like you just get
a couple of magazines...

42:22.120 --> 42:24.880
- Give me your money, bitch!
- You rich motherfuckers.

42:24.960 --> 42:26.320
These are, like, lawyers and shit.

42:26.400 --> 42:28.004
Yeah, we're all gonna do very well today.

42:28.120 --> 42:29.680
Yeah. Yeah.

42:29.760 --> 42:31.080
Let's go to that house first.

42:31.160 --> 42:32.800
Dude, that fucking place is sick.

42:32.880 --> 42:36.168
Oh, yeah, like, I was in Del Rio, Texas.
I was hunting turkey with my stepdad.

42:36.280 --> 42:39.360
That motherfucker was, like,
chasing me for, like, 20 minutes,

42:39.440 --> 42:43.001
like, pecking my ass while
I was running and all that shit.

42:43.120 --> 42:48.440
Man, my stepdad had to shoot the
motherfucker off me, like, straight up.

42:48.520 --> 42:50.720
- Look at that horse.
- Shit, that's tight.

42:50.800 --> 42:52.840
- Yeah, yeah.
- It's badass.

42:52.920 --> 42:54.400
Let me get your number.
Let me get that number.

42:54.480 --> 42:56.960
That is. That's like a ten.
That's like a ten.

42:57.040 --> 42:59.040
Yeah, it probably cost like a thousand.

42:59.120 --> 43:01.440
Damn, look at that house down there.

43:01.520 --> 43:04.720
The thing about it was, I wasn't
even hunting turkey. I was hunting deer.

43:04.800 --> 43:07.406
I wasn't even trying
to hunt the motherfucker.

43:07.520 --> 43:09.160
You'll see me with
a skate park in the back,

43:09.240 --> 43:10.680
a skate park in the front.

43:10.760 --> 43:13.440
A skate park through the house.
I don't give a fuck.

43:13.520 --> 43:15.329
- I'll be skating all day.
- Fuck this place.

43:15.440 --> 43:17.442
- Yeah.
- That's what I got to say.

43:18.480 --> 43:21.000
Hey. All right, I'm calling out teams now.

43:21.080 --> 43:24.323
We're going backwards from yesterday.
QT and Austin is team one.

43:24.440 --> 43:26.160
Kat and Gay Ray's team two.

43:26.240 --> 43:28.440
Kal and Riley's three.

43:28.520 --> 43:32.160
Sean and Shaunte again, four.
Pagan, Billy, five.

43:32.240 --> 43:34.160
- Corey, Runt, six.
- Hell, yeah.

43:34.240 --> 43:35.651
Me and new girl.

43:40.160 --> 43:43.040
I need my pad case
and my cigarettes and my phone.

43:43.120 --> 43:44.645
I'm ready for this.

43:44.800 --> 43:46.120
Let me get out of this car

43:46.200 --> 43:48.521
before I slap the bitch out of her.

43:49.160 --> 43:51.240
Good luck. Have fun.

43:51.320 --> 43:54.449
- You stay on your own side.
- Yeah, faggot ass.

43:55.160 --> 43:57.040
- Hey, you guys got phones?
- Hey, JJ.

43:57.120 --> 43:59.407
- Yeah, I got 'em.
- Sell as many as you can, bro.

44:00.480 --> 44:02.448
- Bitch.
- Dicks.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.160
So it's me and Star next,

44:09.240 --> 44:10.560
and then you're gonna take
Pagan to the church,

44:10.640 --> 44:14.042
- and then we'll just all hook up there.
- All right, cool, yeah.

44:27.200 --> 44:28.406
All right.

44:29.360 --> 44:31.010
How do I look, Death Star?

44:31.880 --> 44:33.291
Let's see.

44:33.920 --> 44:35.251
Hold up.

44:38.240 --> 44:40.766
- Like a smart-ass power agent.
- You know what I'm saying?

44:40.920 --> 44:42.960
Fuck, yeah, like a power agent.

44:44.600 --> 44:46.364
Shut the fuck up.

44:52.440 --> 44:54.522
- Wanna see something crazy?
- Yeah.

44:55.640 --> 44:57.085
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

44:59.440 --> 45:02.410
- Pow.
- That better not be real.

45:04.600 --> 45:08.040
- Dude, are you fucking kidding me?
- You just put that shit in my face?

45:08.120 --> 45:09.360
You're fucking laughing.

45:09.440 --> 45:10.800
You just put a real-ass gun in my face?

45:10.880 --> 45:13.167
Yeah, but it wasn't chambered.
It's not like...

45:16.280 --> 45:18.440
What do you need a gun for anyhow?

45:18.520 --> 45:20.329
I don't trust many people, you know?

45:22.120 --> 45:24.009
- What the fuck?
- Let me see it.

45:25.440 --> 45:26.646
Come on, give it here.

45:28.120 --> 45:29.760
I got it. I just don't know how to...

45:33.520 --> 45:34.681
Asshole.

45:35.640 --> 45:36.926
What did you press?

45:38.320 --> 45:40.080
What did you press?

45:40.160 --> 45:43.320
You really put a fucking gun in my face,
and you don't even know how to use it?

45:43.400 --> 45:45.800
I know how to use it.
I didn't know how to press the release.

45:45.880 --> 45:47.644
There's nothing in it. Relax.

45:50.200 --> 45:51.560
You read the handbook last night

45:51.640 --> 45:54.405
- about the five sales steps?
- Yeah.

45:54.520 --> 45:57.205
That's a bunch of shit, all that.
You don't gotta listen to that.

45:59.560 --> 46:02.040
See, 'cause in Jake's book
there's one fucking step.

46:03.000 --> 46:06.129
Not five, just one.
It just takes one step.

46:06.240 --> 46:09.722
Once you get this one fucking step down,
you're the chief of the tribe.

46:11.440 --> 46:13.400
And I'm gonna teach you
that one step today.

46:13.480 --> 46:15.320
You hear what I'm saying?

46:15.400 --> 46:18.480
Basically, as soon as they
open that door and look at you,

46:18.560 --> 46:21.000
that's the critical moment,
that's the make-or-break moment.

46:21.080 --> 46:23.280
'Cause in that second you gotta work them,

46:23.360 --> 46:25.960
you gotta read them, you gotta be able
to scan them and figure them out,

46:26.040 --> 46:28.720
figure what kind of person
that person wants in their life.

46:28.800 --> 46:32.080
Then you gotta be that person. You know?

46:32.160 --> 46:34.280
So, like, a couple of the
other agents are really rigid

46:34.360 --> 46:38.680
about the five sales steps
and all this shit.

46:38.760 --> 46:42.480
So they'll pick a spiel that's,
like, some sad shit, like...

46:43.720 --> 46:46.480
"Mama's got cancer"
or, "My fucking foot is falling off."

46:46.560 --> 46:48.560
"I'm trying to get my life back together."

46:48.640 --> 46:51.120
You know, "I got a little
lost there in my teens,

46:51.200 --> 46:53.600
and now I'm really working
on myself, man," and,

46:53.680 --> 46:55.480
"Oh, you know, my dad, he died in Iraq."

46:55.560 --> 46:57.120
Any sad spiel, and they'll just say it

46:57.200 --> 46:59.646
over and over and over again
until it's meaningless.

47:00.600 --> 47:04.200
This person? This person doesn't
give a fuck about magazines, right?

47:04.280 --> 47:07.080
They want something from me,
so if I'm a G,

47:07.160 --> 47:11.280
I'm gonna figure out what that
something is and I'm gonna work that.

47:11.360 --> 47:13.362
- Yeah?
- And that's a power agent.

47:14.080 --> 47:16.242
All right. Let's go.
You're my good-luck charm. Here we go.

47:19.800 --> 47:21.600
The thing you gotta remember is,
every Jones is different.

47:21.680 --> 47:22.681
Mmm-hmm.

47:22.800 --> 47:24.640
Every sale, right?

47:24.720 --> 47:25.721
Mmm-hmm.

47:25.840 --> 47:29.447
You gotta treat it like it's a game.
You know?

47:36.480 --> 47:38.244
- Hi.
- Hi.

47:39.240 --> 47:42.240
No, we've never met. I'd remember
a face like that. What's your name?

47:42.320 --> 47:44.440
- Destiny.
- Destiny, I'm Jake. How are you?

47:44.520 --> 47:47.444
- Nice to meet you.
- This is my younger sister, Star.

47:47.760 --> 47:50.400
- Uh, you want my mom?
- No, but can you do me a favor?

47:50.480 --> 47:54.040
One favor. Can you feel this material?
Just feel it.

47:54.120 --> 47:55.840
What does that material feel like to you?

47:55.920 --> 47:56.920
I don't know about that.

47:57.000 --> 47:58.040
You know what kind of material it is?

47:58.120 --> 48:00.080
- Uh-uh.
- That's boyfriend material.

48:00.160 --> 48:01.920
You know what I'm saying? Look right here.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.844
- Who is it?
- Genuine boyfriend...

48:04.960 --> 48:07.320
- Hi, there.
- Can I help you folks?

48:07.400 --> 48:08.920
Hi, yeah, I was just
explaining to your daughter,

48:09.000 --> 48:10.520
we're part of the Three Cs contest,

48:10.600 --> 48:14.200
which is a collegiate
communications competition.

48:14.280 --> 48:17.440
So we've been going door-to-door,
sort of garner support for our team.

48:17.520 --> 48:20.600
Walking all day. You think
I can get a glass of water from you?

48:20.680 --> 48:23.600
- Where's your accent from?
- I'm from Bakersfield, ma'am.

48:23.680 --> 48:25.680
- California.
- Hmm.

48:25.760 --> 48:28.280
- Yeah.
- You're a long way from home.

48:28.360 --> 48:31.603
Long way. But you gotta do
what you gotta do, you know.

48:31.720 --> 48:33.400
Um, I'll get you guys a glass of water.

48:33.480 --> 48:35.080
- Thank you.
- Hold fire, Destiny.

48:35.160 --> 48:36.889
Just you go join your friends.

48:38.400 --> 48:39.800
I'll deal with this.

48:39.880 --> 48:43.200
Uh, good day to walk, though.
Really good day to walk.

48:43.280 --> 48:45.328
How long we walked now? Five, six miles?

48:45.480 --> 48:49.520
- Something like that.
- A little dehydrated, ain't you?

48:49.600 --> 48:51.800
Six or seven miles in this is pretty good.

48:51.880 --> 48:54.087
It could be worse, you know?

48:55.320 --> 48:57.720
- Okay, you can come in.
- Thank you.

48:57.800 --> 48:59.440
- Just for a moment.
- Thank you so much.

48:59.520 --> 49:03.127
Excuse the mess.
Destiny had a birthday sleepover.

49:04.640 --> 49:06.640
I'll just grab you something to drink,

49:06.720 --> 49:08.520
and then you can tell me
about the contest.

49:08.600 --> 49:10.440
Okay.

49:10.520 --> 49:12.648
- This is a beautiful house.
- Thank you.

49:12.760 --> 49:15.684
Yeah. Thanks so much for letting us in.

49:16.480 --> 49:19.920
We have just about everything.
What would you like?

49:20.000 --> 49:21.640
I'll take a beer if you have it.

49:24.800 --> 49:27.246
- How about you?
- I don't want anything.

49:27.680 --> 49:29.762
I thought you were on your last legs.

49:31.200 --> 49:32.201
Well, I'm not.

50:07.320 --> 50:10.600
Okay, well, look, I don't have much time,

50:10.680 --> 50:13.445
so if you wanna just tell me
about the contest.

50:14.920 --> 50:18.163
Well, so basically I'm working on
gaining points towards school.

50:21.480 --> 50:23.880
That's the ultimate dream,
to study, you know?

50:23.960 --> 50:26.600
So if you just... Do you mind if
I put this on the floor for a second?

50:26.680 --> 50:27.960
Oh, sure.

50:28.040 --> 50:30.240
So if you just pick
two items off this list,

50:30.320 --> 50:33.244
that will go a huge way
towards making my dreams a reality.

50:34.640 --> 50:37.920
- How does this get you to college?
- It's an old-fashioned magazine drive.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.360
So for every subscription that
you pick, I get points for.

50:40.440 --> 50:42.800
When I get to 100,000 points,
I'm at like 88,000 now,

50:42.880 --> 50:44.405
I get a free year of school.

50:49.400 --> 50:51.520
So, you're selling magazines?

50:51.600 --> 50:54.800
Yeah, that's what he's doing.
He's selling you magazines.

50:54.880 --> 50:56.600
I'm selling magazines, yeah,
but I'm also selling myself,

50:56.680 --> 50:58.603
you know, belief in my future.

50:59.040 --> 51:00.320
Um...

51:00.400 --> 51:03.440
You know, they put us through a whole
course for, like, five months where...

51:03.520 --> 51:05.760
I'm sorry. I just...
I don't really read magazines anymore.

51:05.840 --> 51:07.640
Yeah, you could give
the magazines to whoever you want.

51:07.720 --> 51:09.000
I mean, it's less about the magazines

51:09.080 --> 51:10.764
and more about sponsoring
impoverished youths,

51:10.880 --> 51:12.080
so that they can chase their dreams

51:12.160 --> 51:14.686
and actually make something
of their lives, you know.

51:14.800 --> 51:18.600
It'd be a belief in me, you know.
I come from nothing, ma'am.

51:18.720 --> 51:21.080
Like I'm an impoverished youth,
bottom barrel,

51:21.160 --> 51:24.840
and this would be my chance to, like,
achieve something more with myself.

51:24.920 --> 51:27.600
- And what do you plan to study?
- Politics.

51:27.680 --> 51:28.727
- Really?
- Yeah.

51:29.320 --> 51:30.765
Why is that funny?

51:32.200 --> 51:34.248
- Oh, it's not.
- No.

51:34.360 --> 51:37.280
- I was just... I was surprised.
- It's a strange pick, you know.

51:37.360 --> 51:39.601
- It's a strange major.
- Why?

51:41.480 --> 51:43.640
I'm sorry. She's my sister.

51:43.720 --> 51:45.120
I love her, but she's special, you know.

51:45.200 --> 51:47.720
I'm not your fucking sister,
and I'm not special, all right?

51:47.800 --> 51:50.610
- Hey.
- You can go fuck yourself.

51:51.080 --> 51:55.210
Hey. I don't allow language
like that in my house.

51:55.560 --> 51:57.164
Well, I don't live here.

51:58.680 --> 52:01.360
You know, it's been really hard
for us emotionally since my mother

52:01.440 --> 52:03.760
threw herself in front of
a cow truck about four years ago.

52:03.840 --> 52:04.960
We've been trying to acclimate.

52:05.040 --> 52:07.000
- That's not even funny.
- Hard to adjust emotionally.

52:07.080 --> 52:08.120
No, it's not funny.

52:08.200 --> 52:10.480
I'm just trying to give her some insight
as to why you're acting out.

52:10.560 --> 52:12.040
Okay, I think it's time for you to go.

52:12.120 --> 52:13.600
I think if you gave me
five more minutes, ma'am.

52:13.680 --> 52:15.840
I have been trying to be Christian,

52:15.920 --> 52:19.083
but I can see the devil
has a hold of the two of you.

52:19.440 --> 52:22.523
I think the devil
has a hold of your daughter.

52:30.400 --> 52:34.280
Destiny, turn off the music
and put some clothes on!

52:34.360 --> 52:38.490
No! It's my birthday,
and you said I could do what I like.

52:38.960 --> 52:41.120
Thank you so much for your time.

52:41.200 --> 52:43.760
- Happy birthday!
- Turn it off!

52:45.000 --> 52:46.081
Hey!

52:50.160 --> 52:54.680
Hey, hey! Hey! What the fuck was that?

52:54.760 --> 52:57.286
- You went too far.
- With what?

52:57.400 --> 52:58.760
With the whole mom
and the cow truck thing.

52:58.840 --> 53:00.920
- You can't say shit like that.
- I said it to you before we went in.

53:01.000 --> 53:02.040
I said it doesn't fucking matter.

53:02.120 --> 53:03.240
You say what you have to say. It's a game.

53:03.320 --> 53:04.520
- You treat it like a game.
- But what if it's true?

53:04.600 --> 53:05.880
- But it wasn't true.
- What if it was?

53:05.960 --> 53:08.320
Oh, what the fuck, man?
It's not fucking true.

53:08.400 --> 53:10.120
You don't know that. What if it is true?

53:10.200 --> 53:13.040
Okay, do your thing. Do your thing.
Do your thing. Do your thing.

53:13.120 --> 53:15.805
I got you a present, and now
I'm gonna throw it in the garbage.

53:18.120 --> 53:19.520
What's crazy is I got you a present,

53:19.600 --> 53:22.160
and now I'm not gonna give you
a fucking thing, stupid.

53:22.240 --> 53:23.605
What present?

53:27.280 --> 53:29.320
What about my present?

53:29.400 --> 53:32.280
Ain't no fucking present no more.
It's gone. Forget about it.

53:32.360 --> 53:34.089
I'm gonna throw it in the trash.

53:36.840 --> 53:38.285
Fuck your present.

53:38.400 --> 53:40.971
I'm gonna throw this shit
in the fucking river right now.

53:42.920 --> 53:43.960
Go swim for the present.

53:44.040 --> 53:45.883
You know how to swim?
You know how to sw...

53:46.720 --> 53:48.520
- Get the fuck off me. Get off me.
- No.

53:48.600 --> 53:49.600
- Get off me.
- No.

53:49.680 --> 53:51.250
- Get off me.
- No.

53:52.320 --> 53:55.240
It's not like it's... All right, come on.

53:55.320 --> 53:57.920
Give me my present.
Give me my fucking present!

53:59.840 --> 54:00.920
Give it to me!

54:01.000 --> 54:03.200
Get the fuck off me. Stop.

54:03.280 --> 54:05.931
- Then give me my present.
- All right, all right, here.

54:12.400 --> 54:13.765
Did you steal it?

54:14.840 --> 54:19.120
They have everything, you know,
including insurance, so it's fine.

54:19.200 --> 54:21.360
- What if it's her wedding ring?
- Who gives a shit?

54:21.440 --> 54:23.560
What, are you fucking
religious or something?

54:23.640 --> 54:25.688
No. God can go fuck himself.

54:26.560 --> 54:27.846
God's a cunt.

54:32.680 --> 54:35.411
What were you, like, sticking up
for me back there or something?

54:37.680 --> 54:39.205
She laughed at you.

54:46.120 --> 54:47.485
I like that you did.

54:49.520 --> 54:51.170
I'll do it again sometime, then.

54:56.160 --> 54:57.320
What the fuck is this thing right here?

54:57.400 --> 55:00.000
Enough of this rap shit.
We're gonna listen to something I like.

55:00.080 --> 55:01.241
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

55:01.360 --> 55:03.160
No, I never hear you. That's the problem.

55:03.240 --> 55:04.920
I said enough of this rap shit.

55:05.000 --> 55:06.560
We're gonna put on something
I like for a change.

55:06.640 --> 55:07.640
Go for it.

55:07.720 --> 55:08.720
...get hit that time.

55:08.800 --> 55:09.800
You didn't even get hit that time.

55:09.880 --> 55:10.880
He hit me right in my fucking knuckles.

55:10.960 --> 55:13.160
He didn't even touch you that time.
He didn't even touch you that time.

55:13.240 --> 55:15.360
He fucking hit my knuckles,
and he fucking knows that.

55:15.440 --> 55:17.400
Why'd you hit her knuckles?

55:17.480 --> 55:20.160
Hey, bitch!
Why'd you hit her knuckles, bitch?

55:20.240 --> 55:21.920
Hey, bitch. Hey, bitch.

55:22.000 --> 55:23.729
Watch it. Your fucking elbow.

56:39.160 --> 56:40.200
Hey, yo, there's Krystal.

56:40.280 --> 56:42.328
Let's do this shit. Come on, bro.

56:43.440 --> 56:45.040
- Hey, excuse me.
- Fuck!

56:45.120 --> 56:47.000
- All right.
- You're getting whacked.

56:47.080 --> 56:48.120
What you get?

56:48.200 --> 56:51.160
- I feel bad for you ladies...
- What you get?

56:55.360 --> 56:56.771
Corey, what you get?

56:59.480 --> 57:01.528
I'll take it. How much you get?

57:02.680 --> 57:04.762
- That's good. That's fine.
- You need these too.

57:05.040 --> 57:06.246
Kat.

57:11.080 --> 57:13.970
Damn. That's a girl.

57:15.040 --> 57:16.326
How much?

57:18.120 --> 57:19.240
I ain't got shit.

57:19.320 --> 57:20.320
You what?

57:20.400 --> 57:22.129
- I ain't got shit.
- You didn't get shit?

57:22.400 --> 57:24.720
- Hell, no.
- Is that a joke?

57:24.800 --> 57:26.325
No, I really ain't got shit.

57:27.520 --> 57:29.170
All right. Jake?

57:39.280 --> 57:40.691
I know. I'm on it.

57:42.440 --> 57:44.720
All right, blank-to-blank for Sean.

57:44.800 --> 57:45.960
Blank-to-blank for Sean.

57:46.040 --> 57:47.690
Get his ass.

58:03.080 --> 58:05.240
I was like, "What are y'all
doing out here from Houston?"

58:05.320 --> 58:07.240
They said, "We're salesmen. Door-to-door."

58:07.320 --> 58:08.890
I was like, "Shut the fuck up."

58:09.520 --> 58:12.360
Who the best seller?
Okay, who the best seller?

58:12.440 --> 58:15.720
The best seller? Probably Jake.

58:15.800 --> 58:17.280
Jake can hustle. Jake can hustle.

58:17.360 --> 58:18.840
Okay. He the top guy?

58:18.920 --> 58:20.200
We gotta round it up. Let's roll.

58:20.280 --> 58:22.720
- Right now.
- We gotta go. Let's go.

58:22.800 --> 58:23.800
- Who is the...
- The worst?

58:23.880 --> 58:25.160
Who is the owner of the magazine crew?

58:25.240 --> 58:26.960
That would be Krystal. She's not here yet.

58:27.040 --> 58:28.400
Krystal not...
Oh, y'all got a female owner?

58:28.480 --> 58:31.800
- Yeah. She's the boss woman.
- Bye, you guys. Nice meeting you.

58:31.880 --> 58:34.720
She's the boss fucking woman.

58:34.800 --> 58:36.086
Bye.

58:36.360 --> 58:38.160
071!

58:38.240 --> 58:39.880
See ya.

59:17.000 --> 59:18.570
Show and tell.

59:19.920 --> 59:23.402
Yeah, work it, work it.

59:25.200 --> 59:26.770
Give it!

59:34.280 --> 59:35.964
Yeah, nigga!

59:44.280 --> 59:47.040
How you doing? I don't believe
we've met yet. I'm Jake Boga.

59:47.120 --> 59:48.920
- This is my sister, Star.
- Hi.

59:49.000 --> 59:50.331
- How you doing, ma'am?
- Good.

59:50.440 --> 59:51.800
- What's your name?
- Pam O'Neil.

59:51.880 --> 59:53.560
- Pam? Pam O'Neil, huh?
- Yes.

59:53.640 --> 59:54.920
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

59:55.000 --> 59:56.400
Have any other students
walked by your house

59:56.480 --> 59:57.891
- from Kansas State?
- No.

59:58.160 --> 59:59.520
- None?
- Not that I'm aware of.

59:59.600 --> 01:00:01.440
Okay, so we picked a good spot.

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:04.600
So, basically, we're here with
the NCA Communications Competition.

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:08.048
We're 50 girls, 50 guys.
Top five get to travel to Hawaii.

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:12.600
Me, too, sir. We're coming from
the United Methodist Baptist Church

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:14.480
about 45 miles from here.

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:16.280
We build a little bit
of a traveling distance.

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:18.806
Come here, Star. This is my sister.

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:22.840
- Hi. Hi there.
- Hello.

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:24.640
How are you? Whole family's here, huh?

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:26.200
How you doing? I'm Jake.

01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:28.040
I don't wanna take up
too much of your time.

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:29.840
I just wanted to come by, say hello,

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:32.160
sorta give you an introduction
as to who we are.

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:35.760
We're coming from K State,
we're doing a magazine drive,

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:38.480
sort of gain some money for
the new cafeteria we're trying to build.

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:39.600
Yeah.

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:42.680
I go to K State, and I haven't heard
about this new cafeteria.

01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:44.480
Yeah, there's a new
cafeteria they're building.

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:47.640
They're trying do it altruistically
as opposed to using like student funds.

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:48.760
Oh!

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:51.440
Trying to sorta see if we can
get it from the community.

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:53.600
It seems like you'd have to
sell a lot to, you know,

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:56.000
actually make enough to build a cafeteria.

01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:57.080
Well, here's the thing...

01:00:57.160 --> 01:01:00.084
Mmm. Now put your finger right here.

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:13.601
Thanks for keeping it alive for me.

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:17.600
- Where you from?
- We're both from Kansas.

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:20.160
- Where?
- Uh, where are you from?

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:23.760
- I'm sorry. I just... My...
- That's okay.

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:26.280
We just walked through a whole bunch
of pollen coming across the street.

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:28.640
- My eyes...
- Kansas City. It's really pretty.

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:30.643
- All the bridges.
- Yeah, yeah. Kansas City.

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:34.246
You know where Zeke's Barbecue is?

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:38.080
So maybe about three blocks around
Zeke's Barbecue by the coin laundry,

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:40.160
there's an apartment building
there called The Magnolia.

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:42.686
- Yeah, I'm not familiar with it.
- It's a really nice area.

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:44.800
- I love barbecue.
- I do, too.

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:47.400
- Yeah. Does your husband love barbecue?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:50.640
You're not gonna believe this, but
there's an outdoor frontiersman magazine

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:53.720
that basically is all about
paleo diets and outdoor eating,

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:57.771
which is a really nice pick,
um, if you have any interest in that.

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:01.610
Ooh, I got this one now.

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:04.880
Watch this. Don't say anything.

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:06.320
Okay.

01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:12.131
# We gotta keep on dreaming

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:17.000
# We gotta keep on dreaming

01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:19.970
# Dream on, dream, baby, dream

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:24.164
# We gotta keep our hearts open

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:28.091
# We gotta keep our hearts open

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:32.720
# We gotta keep our hearts open

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:36.000
# Dream on, dream, baby, dream

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:37.840
You like that, huh?

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:40.810
# We gotta keep our hearts open

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:44.120
- Is she okay?
- What's that?

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:45.680
- Is she okay?
- Oh, yeah.

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:47.320
You just gotta keep her
in your prayers, darling.

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:49.960
We're coming from the Covenant House.
We're trying to help...

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:52.280
- What's the matter with her?
- ...homeless children.

01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:53.560
You got five seconds
of your time to spare?

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:55.640
Oh, I really don't have time right now.

01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:57.640
Not even five seconds
for homeless kids, huh?

01:02:57.720 --> 01:02:59.440
- I am so sorry.
- You sure?

01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:02.569
I'm so sorry. Not right now.

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:09.408
I'm fucking tired, man.

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:16.120
There's only so many
fucking houses, you know?

01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:18.441
Hey, it's not that funny.

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:31.602
Come here. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:27.881
That's it.

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:33.960
Over to the left, one, two.
Down, up. Down, up.

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:35.840
One, two.

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:38.000
Three, four.

01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:39.600
Now flip and do our shit.

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:41.520
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:48.960
- Your way.
- Hey, Star.

01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:52.328
Hey, Krystal wants you. She said now.

01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:54.608
- What?
- What you do?

01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:10.891
You asked for me?

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:13.766
Yeah.

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:19.080
You know Jake's
one of my top sellers, right?

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:20.200
Yeah.

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:22.240
So how come in the past couple of days

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:24.607
he made less than he ever made
in the past year?

01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:29.451
He's training me.

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:33.280
Jake's trained almost everybody on crew.

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:35.203
That ain't stopped him
making money before.

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:38.444
So I wanna know why.

01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:52.002
I don't agree with the way he does things.

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:55.008
You don't like the way he does things?

01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:58.601
Jake.

01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:00.603
- Mmm.
- The fuck you doing?

01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:16.922
- Start with my legs.
- Yep.

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:28.289
So, tell me, what was it that
you don't agree with that Jake does?

01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:34.126
The lying.

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:38.967
He ain't lying.
He's selling. That's his job.

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:44.285
I don't get what you want.
You wanna make money or you don't?

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:47.520
- I wanna make money.
- What?

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:50.968
- I wanna make money.
- She just needs more time.

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:53.968
I'm good with the wild ones, you know?

01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:56.640
I'm not a fucking cow.

01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:59.360
It costs me when you don't earn.
Do you get that?

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:03.600
This shit, the motel, the gas,
everything, that costs me.

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:05.489
And I can't run my business like that.

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:09.650
So you show me you can do it, or I'll
leave you on the side of the road.

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:11.481
Clear?

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:13.361
Crystal.

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:15.526
Is that a joke?

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:18.487
No.

01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:28.645
That's it.

01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:31.640
We have business to take care of.

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:32.801
Turn around.

01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:34.520
- Somebody opened their door...
- Is this Nebraska?

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:36.560
...trying to let their dog
use the bathroom.

01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:38.080
And I seen this bitch, I was like,

01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:40.800
"Damn, she's a badass bitch.
I gotta have her."

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:43.042
So this nigga right here...

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.920
Ran up and snatched this bitch.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.207
- Now she's ours.
- She's our dog now.

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:50.640
Nobody's ever gonna get her back

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:52.848
'cause she's gonna be
the new dog-food dog.

01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:56.962
- Hell, yeah. It's our dog now.
- Or I'd kill you.

01:09:03.399 --> 01:09:05.640
Hey, do you think I can borrow
your phone real quick?

01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:06.881
Yeah.

01:09:09.359 --> 01:09:11.362
I just got one quick call to make.

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:15.080
Thanks.

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:17.401
Make yourself useful. Hold this.

01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:20.439
Who the fuck are you talking to?

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:22.648
- You.
- Okay. I'm sorry.

01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:26.845
- I'm fucking talking to you, damn it.
- I'm sorry. I apologize. Damn, chill.

01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:30.720
Get another fucking tampon or something.

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:37.359
Suck on that. Make sure it bubbles good.

01:09:38.479 --> 01:09:40.080
No, it needs more water.

01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:41.560
Hey, Misty, it's Star.

01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:44.680
I was just seeing
how Kelsey and Rubin were.

01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:45.761
Um...

01:09:46.439 --> 01:09:48.920
Just... I'll call you back later.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.571
Just don't call this number,
but I'll hit you back.

01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:56.642
- That's good.
- Shut up.

01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:03.766
Bella don't want it. Listen, dog, you're
gonna be a stoner by the time it's over.

01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:07.000
There's no doubt in our minds.

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:11.441
Can we get the dog high?

01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:13.767
Oh, shit.

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:15.928
We're getting the dog high, Pagan.

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:19.289
You mad motherfucker.

01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:21.320
Bella wants to get blazed.

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:23.120
Wait. Is that animal cruelty?

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:24.800
No. By far.

01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:33.043
Are you okay?

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:38.120
Yeah, I know. Avoiding the question.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.525
Shall I take it?

01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:06.284
- Bella?
- We good?

01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:09.000
Bella?

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:17.120
- Miss Katness.
- Thank you.

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:18.281
Star.

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:20.640
- Thanks.
- Where's the rooms?

01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:23.160
I'm assuming
they're up there with Krystal.

01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:26.080
Miss Pagan. Is that me?

01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:29.323
Is there a bar here?
Where's the fucking bar?

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:50.086
Hey! Hey!

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:02.602
# I ain't got no type

01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:07.768
# Bad bitches
is the only thing that I like

01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:15.442
# Cups with the ice
yeah, we do this every night

01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:23.684
# ...money so I spend it how I like

01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:27.760
Shaunte.

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:31.120
# ...tell you nigga I ain't living right

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:49.965
# I like what I like

01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:56.890
Yo, you guys want out here?

01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:02.206
Okay, here we go.

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:18.402
You just gonna play
the silent treatment the whole time?

01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:23.761
You forgot to wash your hands, Power Boy.

01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:28.160
I was actually keeping her
sweet for you, Death Star.

01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:31.400
- You ever think of it that way?
- I don't need you to fight my battles.

01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:33.920
I'm not fighting. Actually, I was doing
a service if you think about it.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.760
- Yeah, you were.
- Yeah, for you. You need me.

01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:39.920
I can do this shit by myself.
I don't need you.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.160
Yeah? You're fucked without me,
you understand? I have insight.

01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:45.040
I can teach you this shit.
Without me, you're...

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:47.160
I don't need your help.
I can do this shit on my own.

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:49.000
You wanna do this on your own?
Got you. Do you, then.

01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:50.081
I will.

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:56.000
Star. Stop being stubborn. I have insight.

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:58.128
- Hey!
- Where are you going?

01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:00.800
To make money.

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:03.400
You don't know how!
What the fuck are you doing?

01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:04.891
Is that punk giving you trouble?

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.600
Oh, my God.

01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:09.280
- What the fuck is this?
- Yeah, he is actually.

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:11.200
- Are you going to the fucking rodeo?
- Hop in.

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:13.240
This is like a fucking TV show.
It's like...

01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:14.560
- Thanks.
- You bet.

01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:17.480
# Mamas, don't let your babies

01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:20.400
# Grow up to be cowboys

01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:21.840
# 'Cause they're never alone...

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:22.960
Who is that?

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:25.720
- Some asshole.
- I don't give a shit, Star!

01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:27.723
- Really, I don't care.
- Your beau?

01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:30.124
No, he's just training me.

01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:32.520
Where can we take you, darling?

01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:35.683
Anywhere, as long as
it's far away from him.

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:37.561
Where you from?

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:40.520
Oklahoma.

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:42.807
You don't sound like you're from Oklahoma.

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:45.240
I was born in Texas.

01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:48.051
My mom died three years ago,
so I was sent to Oklahoma.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.526
I'm sorry to hear about that. Cancer?

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:54.480
Meth.

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:03.845
Thanks.

01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:13.120
You're a long way from home, huh?

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:15.440
Yeah, I do selling. Door-to-door.

01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:17.841
Door-to-door selling? What you selling?

01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:20.600
Nothing anyone ever wants to buy.

01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:23.480
Try us.

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:25.560
Magazines.

01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:29.281
What kind of magazines?
Is it like porn magazines?

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:32.160
Porn, crochet, fishing. Everything.

01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:34.527
I'm shit at it, though.
No one ever buys from me.

01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:37.400
Well, I tell you what.

01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:41.883
We're gonna go burn some steaks,
have some beers.

01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:45.685
Why don't you come join us?
We'll buy some of your magazines.

01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:47.880
Y'all would do that?

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:51.169
We ain't got nothing better
to spend our time and money on.

01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:53.487
All right.

01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:56.208
It'll be my first sale.

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:12.720
- I'll get the charcoal.
- Is this your dog?

01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:14.080
Have to get that stuff out of your truck.

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:15.520
- Come on.
- Hi.

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:17.284
This way then.

01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:20.801
- This your house?
- Yep.

01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:24.000
All right, baby, right this way.

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:26.240
We're gonna go downstairs
and out back to the patio,

01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:28.360
fire up the barbecue.

01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:30.761
Step right this way.

01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:39.650
Watch your step, now.
These stairs are a little creepy.

01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:41.205
All right.

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:46.280
All right.

01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:48.362
- You've got a pool?
- Yep.

01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:56.001
Towels are right in there in the cupboard.

01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:04.400
- You want another beer, honey?
- Have you got something stronger?

01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:07.080
Well, I think I might have some mescal.

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:09.680
- What's that?
- Mescal!

01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:16.166
That's... That's some kind
of a spooky, powerful drink.

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:21.284
That's... That's kind of a hard liquor.
Women can't normally handle that.

01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:24.240
Give me some of that, then.

01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:27.164
You want some of that, dear?
Is that what you want?

01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:29.881
- Well, all right then.
- I don't know.

01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:35.809
It's not like normal liquor, you know.
It's got some other kind of power to it.

01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:38.730
Sends you to kind of an ecstatic place.

01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:39.920
Come here.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.527
Like... Like ecstasy. Love drug.

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:45.165
Yeah, I drank a little too much of this...

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:46.800
I got you.

01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:50.170
Some kind of hoodoo-doo-doo.

01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:51.840
You drink enough of that, you'll bark

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:53.843
like a dog and howl at the moon.

01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:57.325
Mescal.

01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:58.720
I would like some of this.

01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:02.884
You wanna go for a swim?

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:05.440
I don't know how to swim.

01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:07.200
Well, you don't really have to swim.

01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:10.489
You can stand right there.
Your head'll be above the water.

01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:15.561
Mmm.

01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:28.040
- Holy shit.
- Come on.

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:31.442
That's the best way to learn.
Here you go. There you go.

01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:34.280
You're all right.

01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:36.680
There you go.
That's the best way to learn.

01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:50.888
I cannot stand in that.

01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:54.040
You're a little wet
behind the ears, aren't you?

01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:56.122
- Pour that up.
- Here you go, darling.

01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:00.680
You want another one?

01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:01.840
Oh, yeah.

01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:04.280
- I like a girl with spunk.
- Easy.

01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:05.840
- There you go.
- Yee-hah!

01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:07.000
That's a hoodoo drink.

01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:11.080
I told you, women shouldn't drink that.
That's bad for women to drink.

01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:12.320
- Fuck it.
- Hey, hey!

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:13.481
Hey, hey, hey. Careful.

01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:15.840
That's a hoodoo drink there, baby.

01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:18.520
- Oh!
- Hoodoo, voodoo drink there.

01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:23.160
Oh, no. Careful with that stuff.

01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:26.323
Hoodoo voodoo-woo. That's a hooja!

01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:30.249
- What the fuck is that?
- That?

01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:32.520
That's a worm.

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:34.600
- A worm?
- Yeah, you're supposed to

01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:35.800
eat it when the bottle's empty.

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:36.927
Oh, gross.

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:38.600
Well, it's supposed to bring you love.

01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:40.560
And luck.

01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:41.766
Wait. Is it dead?

01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:43.640
Either that or it's real, real drunk.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.200
That's so gross.

01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:52.160
Yeah, people like that worm.

01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:54.925
Some people says
they have magical properties.

01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:59.200
You eat that worm,
you'll go on a trip and not even leave.

01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:06.760
Oh, no.

01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:08.440
Mercy.

01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:09.885
Oh!

01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:11.760
Magical.

01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:14.240
That'll wake you up in the morning.

01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:15.600
No. Put you to sleep.

01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:16.840
I think that's enough.

01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:18.000
Careful.

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:21.520
I told you now, that's a very
powerful kind of a substance there

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:23.329
to be fooling around with.

01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:27.040
You're fascinated with
that worm, aren't you?

01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:32.320
You thinking you might
wanna eat that worm?

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:34.160
No, she ain't woman enough to eat that.

01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:35.240
Put the bottle away.

01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:36.600
- It's not for women.
- No.

01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:38.120
And especially not for little girls.

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:39.920
Well, then, let me eat the worm.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.082
- Let you eat the worm?
- I got this.

01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:44.205
You wanna eat that worm?

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.560
We'll buy five of your magazines
if you wanna eat that worm.

01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:49.720
Go ahead, eat the worm.

01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:51.920
We'll buy five of your magazines
right now at the table.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.600
That's my proposition for you, right now.

01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:54.760
I'm in.

01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:56.280
You know they're like
40 bucks each, right?

01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:57.400
Yeah.

01:20:57.480 --> 01:20:59.280
Boys, put your money on the table.

01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:01.800
That's $120 apiece.

01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:03.000
I only got $60.

01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:04.960
Don't worry about it. I'll put in for you.

01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:06.040
You should. I bought the steaks.

01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:07.160
Here we go.

01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:08.800
Yeah, you got me in trouble with my wife.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.320
There you go. Done deal.

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:13.840
Take it easy. Just take it easy.

01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:15.200
Money blowing everywhere.

01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:17.640
- Let me go get my pad case.
- Okay.

01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:19.404
Get her a towel.

01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:24.800
What you got there?

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:26.440
I need your name and your address.

01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:28.568
Name, address, phone number.

01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:29.720
You want our blood type too?

01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:31.280
I need my glasses.

01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:32.360
Put my name at your address

01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:34.442
being as I spend more time at your house.

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:37.840
Forms. I don't believe in that protocol.

01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:39.360
Y'all are serious, right?

01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:42.046
- A deal's a deal.
- Yep.

01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:45.609
- And we are men of our word.
- That's right.

01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:51.322
- Uno, dos, tres.
- Okay, little guy, I'm sorry.

01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:54.562
- Oh, there it goes!
- There it goes.

01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:58.403
- Well done.
- Waggy-daggy!

01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:00.600
There you go. Yay!

01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:01.966
- All right.
- Pow!

01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:03.160
Well done. Well done.

01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:05.520
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Careful.

01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:07.040
- You all right?
- A deal's a deal.

01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:09.000
- I get the money, right?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:10.480
- It's all yours.
- It's all yours.

01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:13.240
You're gonna start
hallucinating here in a minute.

01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:15.280
I've never seen this much money before.

01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:16.920
See? We told you it'd bring you luck.

01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:29.280
What was that? Was that your dog?

01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:31.480
Was it like a... I don't know.

01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:33.369
He ain't never done that before.

01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:42.880
You're kind of a crazy one, aren't you?

01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:02.250
It sounds like a wolf.

01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:07.040
It's a party! It's a party! It's a party!

01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:09.009
It's Jake.

01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:12.084
- Are you a wolf?
- Where's your jacket at?

01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:14.160
I don't have it.

01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:17.403
Wow! Hey, can I party too?

01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:20.160
Come on, come on. You got towels?

01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:21.680
Let's get in the pool.

01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:23.330
- Get in the fucking pool.
- Whoa! Hey!

01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:25.280
Jake, what are you doing?

01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:27.044
- Hey, wait a second.
- Back up. Back up.

01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:29.200
Calm down. They've been nice.

01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:30.640
Drop in the fucking pool.

01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:31.846
They've been nice.

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:34.320
Get in the fucking pool.
Get in the fucking pool.

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:37.131
- In the fucking pool.
- What are you doing? Jake.

01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:39.322
Now. Now. Get in the fucking pool now!

01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:42.840
Hey, you,
that's a very expensive proposition.

01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:44.760
- Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.
- I'm sorry.

01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:47.000
Back up, back up, back up.
Get the keys. Get the money.

01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:50.801
- Get the money. Get the keys. Move.
- Okay. They were nice to me.

01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:52.410
Grab your shit. Where's your jacket?

01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:53.560
I don't have it.

01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:56.166
How the fuck you don't know? Move.

01:23:56.440 --> 01:23:58.840
Hey, get the fuck, fuck... Move.

01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:00.320
What are you doing?

01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:02.840
Car, car, car. Come on, come on.
Jump in the car.

01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:05.844
- What are we doing?
- Jump in the car. Jump in the car.

01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:08.330
- You in?
- Yeah.

01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:33.365
Whoo!

01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:41.801
Whoo!

01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:46.160
How much you make?

01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:47.920
About 400.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.287
Wow. $400.

01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:56.200
Did you let them touch you?

01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:57.920
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.731
It was a sale.
I got the receipts to prove it.

01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:06.760
It's $400.

01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:10.925
$400. I made real cash. All signed.

01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:16.962
- And they paid you in cash also?
- Yeah.

01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:18.691
And you didn't do nothing?

01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:24.085
Okay.

01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:27.720
I'm gonna fucking tell the world.

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:29.920
Four hundred fucking bucks!

01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:41.640
Whoa, I feel like I'm fucking America.

01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:43.609
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:35.681
What?

01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:38.683
You came looking for me.

01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:40.246
Can I come?

01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:43.240
I'm gonna come.

01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:44.401
Can I come?

01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:47.288
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Huh?

01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:31.843
- Hey.
- Hmm.

01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:35.964
- Are you awake?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:40.962
You make a good wolf.

01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:49.440
When I was younger,
like when I was eight or something...

01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:51.440
- Mmm-hmm.
- ...nine, eight, nine,

01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:56.680
my dad used to drop me off
at his old man's house in Bear Valley.

01:30:56.760 --> 01:30:59.240
It's Tehachapi,
it's like the hills of Bakersfield,

01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:01.766
and they got all these woods up there.

01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:05.640
And he used to just let me free,
just let me roam, you know.

01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:09.000
He taught me that wolf noise in case
I ever got lost or got into shit,

01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:10.809
you know, I'd just do the noise.

01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:17.760
How could he tell
if it was you or a real wolf?

01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:20.002
'Cause there's no real wolves up there.

01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:26.600
- So you were the only wolf.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:15.166
Losers' Night.

01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:17.765
Come on.

01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:40.285
Let me get the money.

01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:43.440
- My sales?
- Just give it to me.

01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:44.760
Krystal's gonna be pissed
'cause we missed the pick-up.

01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:47.280
So I just need something to grease
the wheels, like a peace offering.

01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:49.200
But I did the sale.
It's my money. I've got it.

01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:52.640
- No. We did the sales.
- No, I did the sale.

01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:54.802
Can we not argue?
Can you just give it to me?

01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:56.160
Do you wanna be on the mag crew?

01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:58.440
You gotta listen to me.
Just give it to me.

01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:00.240
We missed the pick-up.
We gotta do something.

01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:01.526
Just give it to me.

01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:03.645
Please?

01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:09.600
Can I have the slips, too?
You don't have to give me attitude.

01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:10.880
You gotta listen to me. Just listen to me.

01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:12.240
Don't fight me right now.

01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:13.800
And this relationship thing
with me and you?

01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:15.882
It's not happening, you know.

01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:19.211
What do you mean?

01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:21.320
I mean, we just can't talk
about it 'cause it's, um...

01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:23.000
She's got this thing. She says, you know,

01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:24.520
love is bad for business.

01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:26.720
So there's no relationships
in the mag crew.

01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:28.520
It's just her thing. Just go with it.

01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:30.320
- But what about you and her?
- Just go with it.

01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:31.760
Did you hear me?

01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:33.160
# I'm figgedy, figgedy fucked up!

01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:35.527
Jake, what about you and her?

01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:05.400
Why the fuck is that bitch
wearing your jacket?

01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:07.400
- 'Cause I was hot.
- 'Cause what?

01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:09.920
- 'Cause I was hot.
- 'Cause you was hot?

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:14.130
Can I give you this money?
We did really well today.

01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:19.960
Here's the cash.
And here's these three slips.

01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:21.560
She made that by herself?

01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:24.564
Fight, fight, fight!

01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:30.166
D-O-G! Come on!

01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:36.921
Hey, bitch.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.520
Get up. Come on.

01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:44.001
Fight, fight, fight!

01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:49.880
- Think I won't fight a girl?
- I don't wanna fight you.

01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:52.240
- I just wanna kiss the winner.
- You wanna kiss the winner?

01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:54.640
- Fuck yeah?
- Holy shit.

01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:41.171
Hey, Billy.

01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:47.520
We're going on to the oil town
to find somewhere to stay,

01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:49.320
but I'll text you when it's good to come.

01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:50.400
All right.

01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:52.880
And work all the
truck stops up on the way.

01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:55.725
- You ain't got none in your pocket.
- Star.

01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:04.802
I'm watching you, country girl,
and you're starting to get on my nerves.

01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:09.200
So your training's done now.
You fuck up this week,

01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:12.160
I'm gonna leave you in the plains
with the mountain lions.

01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:14.960
You think that's a joke? Jake, tell her.

01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:19.000
It happens. In Nevada, left a girl
in the desert with nothing.

01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:21.840
It just happened before you came.
East Texas, gas station.

01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:25.129
No food, no water,
no money, no shoes, no shit.

01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:29.000
So don't fuck me off.

01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:30.206
Runt.

01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:37.680
Thank you. Everybody good? Are you good?

01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:47.040
Ow! My fucking toe!

01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:48.690
Happy birthday!

01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:51.800
Happy birthday, Pagan!

01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:53.520
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:55.284
Happy birthday!

01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:58.400
# Happy birthday to you

01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:01.882
# Happy birthday to you

01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:06.920
# Happy birthday, dear Pagan

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:10.400
# Happy birthday to you #

01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:12.360
Hell, yeah!

01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:14.600
Come on, now,
get your ass in the car. Let's go.

01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:16.250
Come on, Runt, let's get gone!

01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:25.089
I dedicate this to Pagan for her birthday.

01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:30.080
# With a hole in my head

01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:33.166
# I looked for you

01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:37.962
# Through the trenches of war

01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:41.411
# The whole world through

01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:46.520
# My desire to leave with you

01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:49.285
# I just can't constrain

01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:54.729
# I regret everything

01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:57.411
# I've done so far

01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:02.720
# When the pillars of love

01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:05.883
Hey, Pagan. For your birthday.

01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:07.611
Thanks.

01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:11.680
# I stumble through the rubble

01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:13.967
# And decay

01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:22.408
# When I'm terrified, I close my eyes

01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:30.443
# When I'm sad and blue, I choose to fight

01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:35.800
# Heartbreak can only take you to #

01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:04.760
This place sucks, man.

01:40:04.840 --> 01:40:06.200
Yeah, it does. Middle of nowhere.

01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:08.280
It's fuckin... it's hot as shit out here.

01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:10.328
What about your city and shit?

01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:12.886
Uh, 323 West 8th Street.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:19.085
And... phone number?

01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:20.800
- You need my phone number?
- Yeah, well, no...

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:25.200
I mean, hey, I could use it.
I could use it, you know. Shit.

01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:26.680
I think the address will work.

01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:28.400
- Yeah, okay.
- All right.

01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:32.240
Let me see how much we owe here.
Give me 20 bucks, man.

01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:34.480
- Twenty bucks?
- We take donations, too.

01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:38.840
You can help us out with the,
you know, the gay club fee and shit.

01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:42.240
Shit, them bitches are expensive.
Hell, yeah.

01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:43.526
- Here you go.
- I appreciate it, man.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.970
Heya. He bought that shit, girl.

01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:04.049
Shit. Hey!

01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:06.800
Hey, can I ask you something?

01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:09.040
You kids selling something?

01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:10.690
Yeah, magazines.

01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:13.488
I don't do magazines. Sorry.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.002
Well, you don't have to read 'em.

01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:20.362
You can use 'em to wipe your ass.

01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:25.885
Fuck.

01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:36.567
Hey, mister? Excuse me.

01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:41.080
Do you have about five minutes?

01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:42.880
Sure. What can I do for you?

01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:46.009
Um, okay, so I'm selling magazines,
you know, like subscriptions and stuff.

01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:47.560
Do you by any chance read those?

01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:51.160
- I do. I like my magazines.
- Yeah? That's awesome.

01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:53.440
That's actually really, really awesome.

01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:57.520
Okay, um, so I have
a bunch of truck magazines.

01:41:57.600 --> 01:42:02.320
It's like $35 for one year
and for two years, like 60 bucks,

01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:05.609
and the more you buy 'em, the more
years you do, it just keeps going down.

01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:07.720
Will it take long?
I'm running a little bit late.

01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:09.723
I've got a drop up the road.

01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:36.680
I know this one.

01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:40.287
- The Boss. I love The Boss.
- Yeah.

01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:44.650
# Dream, baby, dream

01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:53.885
# Dream, baby, dream

01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:57.684
# Come on and dream, baby, dream

01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:02.045
# Come on and dream, baby, dream

01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:11.080
# We gotta keep the light burning

01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:16.160
# Come on, we gotta keep the light burning

01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:28.045
# Come on and dream, baby, dream

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:33.000
# We gotta keep the fire burning

01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:41.640
# Come on, we gotta keep the fire burning

01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:44.360
# Come on and dream, baby, dream

01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:46.240
Is that your family?

01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:48.560
That's my daughter.
She got married last year.

01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:49.846
I gave her away.

01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:54.889
That's sweet.

01:43:55.640 --> 01:43:58.720
# Come on and open up your hearts

01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:02.930
# Come on dream on, dream, baby, dream #

01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:11.930
Are these your magazines?

01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:14.681
Yeah, I read 'em from time to time.

01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:17.280
I got boat magazines.

01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:19.249
Just like those. I got some right there.

01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:23.011
I know I got more.
And I got these ones, look.

01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:26.130
No, I love boats.

01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:28.880
You got a boat?

01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:31.720
- Never even been to the ocean.
- Me neither.

01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:35.282
I know it's crazy, but one day.
It's my dream.

01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:40.405
How about you? What's your dream?

01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:45.248
- No one's ever asked me that before.
- Well, somebody has now.

01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:54.964
I wanna have my own place,
and my own trailer.

01:44:56.680 --> 01:44:59.365
You know, somewhere with lots of trees,
like real big ones.

01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:00.811
Yeah.

01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:02.764
And lots of kids.

01:45:03.160 --> 01:45:05.162
Well, you'll need a big trailer.

01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:09.162
How much for these two?

01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:14.685
- You're gonna get both of 'em?
- I figure I will.

01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:21.690
Bye. Thank you.

01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:16.881
Ugh.

01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:25.845
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck!

01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:28.401
Oh!

01:46:56.040 --> 01:46:57.769
Be happy for once.

01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:01.000
- She's happy all the time.
- No, she's not.

01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:03.160
She's only happy when her dude's around.

01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:05.368
- Who's her dude?
- I don't have a dude.

01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:06.880
Let me know who the fuck her dude is.

01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:08.560
You don't know who the fuck her dude is?

01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:10.802
- Let me know. Jake?
- I don't have a dude.

01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:13.440
Yeah, she doesn't have a fucking dude.

01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:16.888
Yeah, she does. She's...

01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:19.400
She's fucking whipped.

01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:20.766
Are you whipped?

01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:27.202
Wow. That water's really dirty.

01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:28.840
Gary on the line.
Gary, you went out with Tonya.

01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:31.960
Tell us a little bit about the date,
how it went and what's going on.

01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:34.040
Well, you know what,
thanks for having me on.

01:48:34.120 --> 01:48:35.680
I thought it went really well.

01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:39.400
Uh, you know, it seemed like
everything was going right.

01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:41.400
We had a nice dinner, we danced...

01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:45.883
There's just some fast money.
Let's go rob the oil thingy.

01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:50.407
Hell, yeah, you can.

01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:54.411
I really wish I could meet the
motherfucker that invented selling dirt.

01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:56.520
Everybody looks rich as fuck around here.

01:48:56.600 --> 01:48:59.520
- They got big-ass nice trucks.
- So much oil around here.

01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:00.920
I know, right?

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:02.760
Y'all, this little town
looks sketchy as shit.

01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:04.683
There's a lot of fucking
redneck trucks here.

01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:08.043
I don't know if I'm gonna be
able to sell here. I'll get shot.

01:49:09.200 --> 01:49:10.880
No, dude. I heard this story, right,

01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:15.000
and in Montana, these two meth-heads
grabbed this woman,

01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:17.840
killed her, raped her,
and then drove to this town

01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:20.440
and bought a shovel at Walmart,
buried her in this town,

01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:22.400
and then returned the shovel at Walmart.

01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:24.403
- Yes, yes, yes. Now.
- Oh, shit.

01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:26.320
That's some fucking whack shit.

01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:28.880
- Now, Star, are you gonna walk alone?
- It felt a little dangerous...

01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:52.610
Jake?

01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:28.486
Where are we even staying?
This is the middle of nowhere.

01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:38.971
- We got a house?
- Here you go.

01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:41.210
Oh!

01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:45.445
My God. We got us a fucking house.

01:50:49.720 --> 01:50:51.006
Here we are!

01:50:53.280 --> 01:50:55.760
- Y'all, get out my fucking...
- Bullshit.

01:50:57.400 --> 01:50:59.482
- Shit.
- Yo, this place is dope!

01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:01.640
Hey!

01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:03.240
I'll be able to look at the stars tonight.

01:51:03.320 --> 01:51:04.480
I bet you it's awesome at night.

01:51:04.560 --> 01:51:06.880
- This place is big as fuck.
- This is dope as fuck!

01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:08.080
Where the fuck did Jake just go?

01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:09.525
What the fuck?

01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:12.120
Yo! The bathroom's sick too.

01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:14.441
I'm sleeping outside!

01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:16.240
And we got a kitchen!

01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:18.561
We can have home-cooked meals.

01:51:19.960 --> 01:51:23.120
- There's a symbol on the wall.
- Oh, look at that wall.

01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:25.360
You got water to wash your dishes.

01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:28.091
- Are we picking rooms?
- No more catfish.

01:51:28.200 --> 01:51:30.441
I hated that fish, nigga.

01:51:35.560 --> 01:51:37.000
Are we picking bedrooms?

01:51:37.080 --> 01:51:38.960
Look. I already got a sign on my door.

01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:40.560
All right, this is my room.

01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:42.280
All right, me and Kal got this room.

01:51:46.160 --> 01:51:47.844
Yeah, I want that one.

01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:50.050
This one's my room.

01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:54.970
That's my room. Yeah?

01:52:34.680 --> 01:52:36.682
Where's the necklace I gave you?

01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:39.120
I gave it to Pagan for her birthday.

01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:41.840
You gave it to Pagan? You always do that?

01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:43.922
You always give presents away?

01:52:44.840 --> 01:52:46.842
You don't keep 'em?

01:52:49.120 --> 01:52:51.640
- New boots?
- Mmm-hmm. Present.

01:52:51.720 --> 01:52:53.520
Sun-tan duty present?

01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:55.480
I do other shit than sun-tan, you know.

01:52:55.560 --> 01:52:58.560
This is like the most
expensive rent in the fucking country,

01:52:58.640 --> 01:53:01.041
and you're staying in a free house.
That's on me.

01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:03.922
Good job. Real proud of you.

01:53:04.040 --> 01:53:06.042
- Fuck off.
- You fuck off.

01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:10.766
Mmm.

01:53:37.640 --> 01:53:38.687
Star.

01:53:48.240 --> 01:53:49.969
Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

01:53:50.440 --> 01:53:53.205
- Wait.
- I can't stop.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:58.729
- Do you mind?
- No.

01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:46.760
- That feels good.
- Okay?

01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:48.968
Yeah. Please.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:52.445
Please.

01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:03.801
Fuck.

01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:07.205
Oh, fuck.

01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:15.046
Right there. Right there. Oh, yeah.

01:55:23.680 --> 01:55:27.480
Fuck.

01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:29.210
Oh, fuck.

01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:19.362
Do you have any dreams?

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:25.961
Dreams? Like future dreams?

01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:27.651
Yeah.

01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:31.682
Nobody's ever asked me that.

01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:37.602
I mean, I collect...

01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:41.562
I got a secret thing I'll show you.

01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:44.043
What is it?

01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:47.401
It's just better if I show you.

01:56:47.520 --> 01:56:50.364
Well... to say it. I'll just show you.

01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:40.404
Wake up.

01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:42.564
Stop.

01:57:43.720 --> 01:57:45.165
Fuck, man.

01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:50.320
Shut the fuck up, man.
I'm trying to fucking sleep.

01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:51.401
- What?
- It's later.

01:57:51.560 --> 01:57:53.000
You said you'd show me later.

01:57:53.080 --> 01:57:56.402
- What?
- You said later.

01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:04.400
All right.

01:58:04.480 --> 01:58:07.000
I don't show nobody this.

01:58:07.080 --> 01:58:09.560
So, my dream.

01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:12.083
Here is...

01:58:14.040 --> 01:58:15.565
...my dream.

01:58:15.720 --> 01:58:18.166
I've been collecting this for two years.

01:58:31.120 --> 01:58:33.964
- It's like treasure.
- It is treasure.

01:58:37.160 --> 01:58:39.080
All this stuff is from the houses?

01:58:39.160 --> 01:58:40.571
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

01:58:44.920 --> 01:58:47.280
You think they're gonna miss
any of this stuff?

01:58:47.360 --> 01:58:49.203
- Who?
- The people.

01:58:49.800 --> 01:58:51.290
I don't know.

01:58:56.840 --> 01:58:58.880
How is this your dream, though?

01:58:58.960 --> 01:59:01.804
Well, that's not the dream,
but that buys the dream.

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.960
I just wanna get, like,
my own spot somewhere in the woods

01:59:06.040 --> 01:59:09.440
and just fucking...
Just stay small, you know.

01:59:09.520 --> 01:59:11.880
Like a little duplex or something.

01:59:11.960 --> 01:59:14.120
Like the 40 acres and a mule, you know?

01:59:14.200 --> 01:59:16.487
Just some piece of land
in the woods somewhere.

01:59:19.880 --> 01:59:21.689
Someday.

01:59:21.800 --> 01:59:24.007
This is a lot, though.
It's gonna be enough.

01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:29.044
Not quite. I need a couple
more thousand probably.

01:59:33.360 --> 01:59:35.203
Did you hear that?

01:59:35.800 --> 01:59:37.640
This is so fucking crazy.

01:59:37.720 --> 01:59:39.880
Whoa.

01:59:39.960 --> 01:59:41.560
See? You're not the only wolf.

01:59:43.760 --> 01:59:46.040
- Fucking pizza.
- Fuck you, pizza.

01:59:46.120 --> 01:59:47.440
Where's that pepperoni?

01:59:47.520 --> 01:59:50.280
- What up, Krystal?
- What up, QT?

01:59:50.360 --> 01:59:51.680
What's happening? What's up?

01:59:51.760 --> 01:59:54.440
- I got presents and I got you pizza.
- You got some presents? Okay.

01:59:54.520 --> 01:59:58.720
Okay, so this town has got people
from all over the country

01:59:58.800 --> 02:00:00.640
and it's filled with fucking oil.

02:00:00.720 --> 02:00:02.360
- So what does that mean?
- Money.

02:00:02.440 --> 02:00:03.840
# Money, money, money

02:00:03.920 --> 02:00:06.040
It means these people
are making a shit load of money.

02:00:06.120 --> 02:00:07.280
And how does that make people feel when

02:00:07.360 --> 02:00:08.600
- they make that kind of cash?
- Amazing!

02:00:08.720 --> 02:00:11.400
- Makes me wanna cream my jeans.
- No, it makes them feel like shit.

02:00:11.480 --> 02:00:13.120
- Yeah.
- It makes them feel guilty.

02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:15.441
So I want y'all to dress
like dirty white trash,

02:00:15.560 --> 02:00:16.760
and then they'll pity you.

02:00:16.840 --> 02:00:19.160
- Dirty white trash.
- Like we're not trashy enough.

02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:21.040
Can I be clean white trash?

02:00:23.360 --> 02:00:25.328
Oh, no, that's the boys' bag.

02:00:25.440 --> 02:00:27.488
Pagan.

02:00:27.600 --> 02:00:29.800
- It's a shirt.
- No, that's a dress.

02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:32.167
That's what you wear. That's for Shaunte.

02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:36.931
Star.

02:00:37.040 --> 02:00:38.320
That's a dress.

02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:40.926
Yeah, you don't wear
underwear with that too.

02:01:24.240 --> 02:01:29.080
So the men here work 17 hours a day,
so there are some lonely ladies here.

02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:30.480
So I'm gonna drop all the boys off here.

02:01:30.560 --> 02:01:31.607
- Jake.
- Yeah.

02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:33.370
Billy, y'all get out here.

02:01:39.640 --> 02:01:41.642
Make that money, honey.

02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:47.608
Look at that mama with her baby.

02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:05.291
Kalium, there's a bee. There's a bee.

02:02:17.440 --> 02:02:20.560
Put some fucking shoes on.
Put some damn shoes on.

02:02:20.640 --> 02:02:22.160
Hey, why are you dressed like that?

02:02:22.240 --> 02:02:24.440
- You dressed me like this.
- No, I didn't.

02:02:24.520 --> 02:02:25.567
Yes, you did.

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:35.640
Y'all are gonna make hella money today.

02:02:35.720 --> 02:02:37.440
I'm taking you out to the oil fields.

02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:40.205
These guys make
like a hundred grand a year.

02:02:42.440 --> 02:02:43.480
Shit got real.

02:02:43.560 --> 02:02:44.760
They're away from home,

02:02:44.840 --> 02:02:46.126
- there's no ladies...
- Ooh!

02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:48.928
Butter 'em up, baby. Butter 'em up!

02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:51.840
- It's gonna pump you up.
- It's gonna pump me up?

02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:53.960
I love getting pumped up.

02:02:55.560 --> 02:02:59.320
So get 'em before they get off to work.

02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:00.481
Let's do that shit.

02:03:00.600 --> 02:03:02.840
Long day selling magazines, huh, Bella?

02:03:02.920 --> 02:03:04.920
Check out this song I got for you.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
Hey!

02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:08.240
Check it. Let's go. Let's pump it up!

02:03:08.320 --> 02:03:10.209
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

02:03:12.280 --> 02:03:15.568
# Yellow diamonds in the light

02:03:16.040 --> 02:03:19.931
# Now we're standing side by side

02:03:20.120 --> 02:03:22.771
# As your shadow crosses mine

02:03:23.440 --> 02:03:27.525
# What it takes to come alive

02:03:30.560 --> 02:03:36.522
# It's the way I'm feeling
I just can't deny

02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:40.885
# But I've gotta let it go

02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:47.080
# We found love in a hopeless place

02:03:53.440 --> 02:03:57.000
# We found love in a hopeless place #

02:03:57.080 --> 02:03:58.650
Yeah, QT.

02:03:58.800 --> 02:04:00.370
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

02:04:11.120 --> 02:04:12.246
Whoo-hoo!

02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:14.291
Oh, yeah!

02:04:14.440 --> 02:04:16.329
- Thank you.
- Whoo!

02:05:05.280 --> 02:05:06.327
Whoo!

02:05:06.760 --> 02:05:07.807
Shake it!

02:05:10.960 --> 02:05:13.840
What's up, ladies?
You girls prostitutes or what?

02:05:13.920 --> 02:05:16.000
The fuck? Do we look like prostitutes?

02:05:16.080 --> 02:05:18.600
- I mean, kinda, yeah. Sorry.
- Ooh!

02:05:18.680 --> 02:05:21.280
Actually, we're sales
associates and we work hard.

02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:23.520
- Okay, okay. Well...
- What are you selling?

02:05:23.600 --> 02:05:25.320
- I sell magazines.
- The bus is here.

02:05:25.400 --> 02:05:26.440
You gotta make your money somehow.

02:05:26.520 --> 02:05:27.520
I respect that.

02:05:27.600 --> 02:05:28.600
Good luck, sales associates.

02:05:28.680 --> 02:05:29.920
Can I get you to go for me?

02:05:30.040 --> 02:05:31.480
It's okay. All right.

02:05:31.560 --> 02:05:33.000
How about, er... I gotta go to work.

02:05:33.080 --> 02:05:34.520
How about you give me your phone number?

02:05:34.600 --> 02:05:37.320
- Go get some drinks?
- How about a kiss?

02:05:37.400 --> 02:05:39.600
A kiss? Already? Damn.

02:05:39.680 --> 02:05:41.160
You called me a prostitute.

02:05:41.240 --> 02:05:44.000
- Do you like prostitutes?
- I love prostitutes.

02:05:44.080 --> 02:05:45.605
Well, put your sunglasses
on top of your head.

02:05:45.720 --> 02:05:47.880
- Not right now.
- Are you sure?

02:05:47.960 --> 02:05:50.280
Yeah, I'm all right.
I gotta get to work. Thank you.

02:05:50.360 --> 02:05:51.560
- It's free.
- I know it is.

02:05:51.640 --> 02:05:52.880
All right, then.

02:05:52.960 --> 02:05:55.160
- Come on, let's go.
- Ask for five minutes.

02:05:55.240 --> 02:05:56.760
You're not gonna find many good guys here.

02:05:56.840 --> 02:05:58.440
I didn't say I was looking for men.

02:05:58.520 --> 02:06:00.204
- Hey, wait!
- Whoa.

02:06:00.320 --> 02:06:02.560
Wait.

02:06:02.640 --> 02:06:05.610
I wanna see the oil field.
Do you think I could ride with y'all?

02:06:07.760 --> 02:06:09.683
- What do y'all think?
- Yeah.

02:06:10.480 --> 02:06:12.200
Climb up in.

02:06:12.280 --> 02:06:13.691
Thanks.

02:06:16.360 --> 02:06:18.640
Y'all are good.

02:06:18.720 --> 02:06:20.131
Star!

02:06:21.240 --> 02:06:22.800
Wait!

02:06:22.880 --> 02:06:24.211
What the fuck?

02:06:25.400 --> 02:06:27.402
Where you going?

02:06:34.240 --> 02:06:35.571
So you're all rich?

02:06:36.560 --> 02:06:38.960
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we're filthy rich.

02:06:39.040 --> 02:06:41.566
Hell, everyone working
the oil field's rich.

02:06:43.480 --> 02:06:47.007
If you're all so damn filthy rich,
y'all can buy some of my magazines.

02:06:47.880 --> 02:06:51.240
So you hopped in the bed of this truck
to sell us fucking magazines?

02:06:51.320 --> 02:06:53.971
- Basically.
- What kind of bullshit is that?

02:07:00.840 --> 02:07:04.447
- You make money selling that shit?
- I got a shit-ton of titles.

02:07:04.560 --> 02:07:06.960
What kind of titles are
we talking about? Playboy?

02:07:07.040 --> 02:07:09.800
Well, anything you like.

02:07:09.880 --> 02:07:11.960
- You like boats, deer?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

02:07:12.040 --> 02:07:14.000
I'll give you $500
to hang out with me tonight.

02:07:14.080 --> 02:07:17.400
- Yeah.
- Oh, hell.

02:07:17.480 --> 02:07:18.970
- $500?
- Coming on strong.

02:07:19.080 --> 02:07:23.005
- That's exactly what I said.
- Sounds like a pretty good deal to me.

02:07:27.600 --> 02:07:30.649
How about a grand?
For a grand, I'll do it.

02:07:37.760 --> 02:07:39.808
A thousand dollars? I can get that.

02:07:42.440 --> 02:07:46.161
- When?
- We get off work around 10:00 tonight.

02:07:49.280 --> 02:07:52.080
- He's a dog.
- I got it.

02:07:52.160 --> 02:07:53.605
- I definitely got it.
- All right.

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.002
You actually came.

02:08:39.840 --> 02:08:41.842
Get on in.

02:08:59.720 --> 02:09:03.360
I brought some wine for you.
I figured all girls like wine.

02:09:03.440 --> 02:09:05.249
Yeah, thanks.

02:09:07.760 --> 02:09:09.364
Cheers.

02:09:31.480 --> 02:09:34.560
- So where are we going?
- It's a surprise.

02:09:34.640 --> 02:09:36.165
I think you'll really like it.

02:10:20.360 --> 02:10:22.124
Especially for you.

02:10:44.200 --> 02:10:46.248
This is a good deal, isn't it?

02:10:47.040 --> 02:10:48.600
There are a lot of guys
that would get you drunk

02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:50.682
and take advantage of you anyways.

02:10:54.680 --> 02:10:56.091
Yeah.

02:11:05.200 --> 02:11:07.202
Can you play with me a little bit?

02:11:43.640 --> 02:11:45.680
This is a nice truck.

02:11:47.800 --> 02:11:49.360
What's funny?

02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:54.287
You're sitting there talking about
my truck while you're stroking my cock.

02:11:55.520 --> 02:11:57.602
Well, it's a nice truck.

02:11:57.720 --> 02:12:02.282
Yeah. Kinda turns me on.

02:12:15.720 --> 02:12:17.722
Am I doing this right?

02:12:18.400 --> 02:12:20.050
Can I ask you to do me a favor?

02:12:20.160 --> 02:12:22.891
- Since I am paying for this.
- Okay.

02:12:24.280 --> 02:12:26.282
Could you be quiet?

02:12:28.680 --> 02:12:30.682
Okay, I'll shut up.

02:12:39.800 --> 02:12:41.290
How long do you think you need?

02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:44.168
For fuck's sake.

02:12:45.760 --> 02:12:47.728
Can we try something else?

02:12:49.520 --> 02:12:51.488
Can you take your panties off?

02:13:16.560 --> 02:13:18.483
Turn and face me.

02:13:34.760 --> 02:13:36.762
Open your legs.

02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:45.125
More.

02:14:21.640 --> 02:14:23.449
You can pull over right here.

02:14:32.080 --> 02:14:33.809
Thanks.

02:14:33.960 --> 02:14:36.122
Don't I get a kiss good night?

02:15:02.200 --> 02:15:05.124
- What the fuck are you doing?
- 071, motherfucker.

02:15:06.080 --> 02:15:08.003
Get the fuck off!

02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:13.529
Fuck you, dog!

02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:29.690
Star, stop. It's fucking me. Stop.

02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:32.971
Shit.

02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:34.886
You okay?

02:15:36.360 --> 02:15:37.566
You missed your pick-up.

02:15:39.640 --> 02:15:42.086
I got stuck in town.

02:15:43.120 --> 02:15:44.640
You got stuck in town?

02:15:44.720 --> 02:15:46.927
Yeah, who was the Jones in the truck?

02:15:48.200 --> 02:15:50.567
He just dropped me off.

02:15:54.520 --> 02:15:56.568
You fucked him?

02:15:58.720 --> 02:16:00.688
- Did you fuck him?
- No.

02:16:01.160 --> 02:16:03.360
Did you fuck him, Star? Look at me.

02:16:03.440 --> 02:16:05.442
- What did you do?
- Look at me.

02:16:07.280 --> 02:16:09.282
Did you fuck him?

02:16:09.840 --> 02:16:11.683
- Star...
- No, I didn't.

02:16:14.280 --> 02:16:15.441
I got his money.

02:16:15.560 --> 02:16:20.805
I thought we could maybe get a trailer
in the woods together.

02:16:32.360 --> 02:16:34.361
Don't fucking move. Just stop.

02:16:50.600 --> 02:16:52.647
Just tell me.

02:16:53.959 --> 02:16:58.761
I just thought
maybe we could leave together.

02:17:08.799 --> 02:17:11.406
What do you care? You fuck Krystal anyway.

02:17:14.959 --> 02:17:16.325
Fuck, man!

02:17:19.200 --> 02:17:20.486
You fucked him.

02:17:21.840 --> 02:17:23.280
You fucked him.

02:17:23.360 --> 02:17:24.691
You fucked him!

02:17:28.680 --> 02:17:30.125
Jake.

02:17:31.400 --> 02:17:32.969
Jake.

02:18:00.639 --> 02:18:02.280
Fuck, Star, you all right?

02:19:35.959 --> 02:19:36.959
Bella.

02:19:37.040 --> 02:19:39.200
- Bella, come here, baby.
- Hey, everybody, let's go!

02:19:39.280 --> 02:19:40.281
Go!

02:19:41.959 --> 02:19:44.200
Move that ass, come on.

02:19:46.360 --> 02:19:48.806
Come on, Drema.
Shit, we ain't got all day.

02:19:50.400 --> 02:19:52.368
What you just standing there for?

02:19:58.560 --> 02:20:01.006
Hey, Star, hurry up! We need to pack up!

02:20:04.600 --> 02:20:09.288
I liked that house. Bye, house.

02:20:15.960 --> 02:20:18.167
- Hey, what's your name?
- Drema.

02:20:19.280 --> 02:20:21.282
Drema, I'm Star.

02:20:35.400 --> 02:20:37.846
It's so cute.

02:20:38.280 --> 02:20:41.204
Hey, yeah. Put it on Drema.

02:20:45.280 --> 02:20:47.282
It's got really big eyes.

02:21:00.520 --> 02:21:02.090
I got the munchies.

02:21:03.040 --> 02:21:05.088
Twelve miles.

02:21:18.960 --> 02:21:20.769
Are we there yet?

02:21:25.640 --> 02:21:27.400
Hey, yo, what's this place called?

02:21:27.480 --> 02:21:29.520
- Rapid City.
- We're in Rapid City, bro.

02:21:29.600 --> 02:21:31.400
Hey, do they got,
like, white water rapids?

02:21:31.480 --> 02:21:33.160
No, they got Krystal's family here.

02:21:33.240 --> 02:21:34.520
She grew up here and shit.

02:21:34.600 --> 02:21:37.285
- There's Taco Bell!
- Taco Bell!

02:21:39.560 --> 02:21:40.920
I've been looking for Taco Bell.

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:42.440
Fuck you, Burger King.

02:21:42.520 --> 02:21:44.880
- Bro, that's a skate spot.
- I found my smoke shop.

02:21:44.960 --> 02:21:47.281
Cheap smokes, vapor, e-cigs, hookahs.

02:21:48.640 --> 02:21:51.720
No, I don't wanna
eat in there. It's stupid.

02:21:51.800 --> 02:21:53.080
I bet Jake's waiting for us at the hotel.

02:21:54.440 --> 02:21:55.851
He never ran off before.

02:21:59.960 --> 02:22:00.960
About goddamn time.

02:22:01.040 --> 02:22:02.451
# Bitch, you guessed it

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:04.081
# Whoo!

02:22:05.800 --> 02:22:08.121
- Let's do this.
- Get our bags. Get our bags.

02:22:08.680 --> 02:22:10.921
- Somebody grab my bag.
- Fuck this van!

02:22:12.120 --> 02:22:14.088
Y'all grab my bag. I'm not doing it.

02:22:15.640 --> 02:22:17.440
- QT!
- Yes, ma'am!

02:22:17.520 --> 02:22:20.046
- Come on, Bella.
- What up?

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:23.570
I got three rooms.

02:22:23.680 --> 02:22:25.240
You deal with this shit, 'cause I can't.

02:22:25.320 --> 02:22:29.240
- All right, I got you.
- Star, I gotta talk to you.

02:22:29.320 --> 02:22:33.280
Hey, guys, we got three rooms.
Two for the boys, one for the girls.

02:22:33.360 --> 02:22:35.960
23, 36...

02:22:36.040 --> 02:22:38.930
- Bam! 36.
- ...12.

02:22:39.560 --> 02:22:41.164
We're 12?

02:22:43.600 --> 02:22:45.329
Thanks.

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:48.445
Yo!

02:23:08.320 --> 02:23:10.322
You think you're special.

02:23:19.280 --> 02:23:24.650
You know, I pay Jake... girl-money.

02:23:25.600 --> 02:23:28.490
A hundred dollars
every time he finds a girl.

02:23:30.960 --> 02:23:33.645
Where you think Drema came from?

02:23:37.760 --> 02:23:41.048
And he fucks all of them, too.
Y'all don't mean nothing to him.

02:23:53.720 --> 02:23:56.564
I've been trying to think
if I should keep you or not.

02:23:58.720 --> 02:24:00.768
Did you make any money in Williston?

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.606
Yeah, I did, but I ain't got
the slips for you.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.890
That's cool. Just give me the money
and give me the slips later.

02:24:36.840 --> 02:24:38.842
Did you think that was Jake?

02:24:43.520 --> 02:24:45.522
That's Bill.

02:24:46.120 --> 02:24:48.122
- Bill, that's Star.
- Hey, Star.

02:24:50.240 --> 02:24:52.242
And that's Frank.

02:24:59.800 --> 02:25:01.643
Jake's gone.

02:25:02.360 --> 02:25:04.647
I told him he can't come back again.

02:25:12.520 --> 02:25:14.363
Anyways...

02:25:24.560 --> 02:25:27.040
Hey, so this is all... Hey!

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.440
- Krystal's fucking talking.
- Yo, everybody.

02:25:31.520 --> 02:25:34.440
So this is all poor people.
I've got family from here.

02:25:34.520 --> 02:25:36.520
It's just poor people like y'all,

02:25:36.600 --> 02:25:38.728
so they'll pity you because
you're just like them.

02:25:38.840 --> 02:25:41.920
- Got you. Got you.
- So just act normal.

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:45.368
- Have normal conversations.
- Yes, ma'am.

02:25:56.160 --> 02:25:59.767
I'll pick y'all up here at 8:00. Okay?

02:26:00.200 --> 02:26:01.960
- Right here?
- Right here.

02:26:02.040 --> 02:26:03.326
- Yeah.
- All right.

02:26:03.440 --> 02:26:04.600
Good enough.

02:26:04.680 --> 02:26:07.560
# I said, one, two, three, four, five

02:26:07.640 --> 02:26:09.320
# This crew don't take no jibe

02:26:09.400 --> 02:26:10.920
# Six, seven, eight, nine, ten

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:12.440
# Let's back it up and do it again

02:26:12.520 --> 02:26:14.320
- # Say I...
- # Hey-o!

02:26:14.400 --> 02:26:15.480
- # Got money
- # Got dough

02:26:15.560 --> 02:26:18.800
# I said, shit, goddamn
get off your ass and slam

02:26:18.880 --> 02:26:21.724
071, 071, 071!

02:26:21.840 --> 02:26:24.207
Hey, let's get that money, crew!

02:26:24.920 --> 02:26:26.840
# It's all about the money

02:26:26.920 --> 02:26:28.000
# Money, money

02:26:28.080 --> 02:26:31.721
Yeah, try getting money from
these motherfuckers, see what happens.

02:27:07.880 --> 02:27:09.360
Hey, is you guys' dad home?

02:27:09.440 --> 02:27:11.841
- No.
- What about your mom?

02:27:11.960 --> 02:27:13.564
Our mom...

02:27:16.040 --> 02:27:20.040
- Hello.
- Hey.

02:27:20.120 --> 02:27:23.040
- Is that your favorite band?
- No. Come in.

02:27:23.120 --> 02:27:24.406
Come in?

02:27:24.520 --> 02:27:27.160
My favorite band is Dead Kennedys.

02:27:28.320 --> 02:27:30.880
And their best song is "I Kill Children."

02:27:30.960 --> 02:27:32.610
Know it?

02:27:34.440 --> 02:27:36.600
Have you heard "I Kill Children?"

02:27:36.680 --> 02:27:38.240
No. How does it go?

02:27:38.320 --> 02:27:39.360
It goes...

02:27:39.440 --> 02:27:42.080
# I kill children, I wanna see them die

02:27:42.160 --> 02:27:45.050
# I kill children to make their mamas cry

02:27:47.200 --> 02:27:48.770
That's good.

02:27:54.080 --> 02:27:55.605
What are you looking for?

02:27:55.720 --> 02:27:58.400
- Candy.
- Candy? I don't got any candy.

02:27:58.480 --> 02:27:59.720
I'm sorry.

02:28:00.960 --> 02:28:04.320
- You wanna see that?
- What that? Spider-Man?

02:28:04.400 --> 02:28:07.720
Yeah, Spider-Man. Do you want it?

02:28:07.800 --> 02:28:08.800
Uh-huh.

02:28:08.880 --> 02:28:12.168
Okay. I'll put it on your shirt.

02:28:14.480 --> 02:28:16.767
- Pin it right here.
- Okay.

02:28:19.440 --> 02:28:21.442
On your shirt.

02:28:25.480 --> 02:28:27.209
My mom's sleeping.

02:28:28.560 --> 02:28:30.562
Uh, what about your dad? Where is he at?

02:28:32.280 --> 02:28:34.282
He's in Omaha.

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.526
You guys think I could have
something to drink?

02:28:59.360 --> 02:29:01.560
We have Mountain Dew.

02:29:01.640 --> 02:29:03.642
- That works.
- All right.

02:29:18.560 --> 02:29:20.520
- There you go.
- Thanks.

02:29:20.600 --> 02:29:21.965
You're welcome.

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.120
- I should probably get going.
- Wait.

02:29:34.200 --> 02:29:36.360
Can I sing you the rest of the song?

02:29:36.440 --> 02:29:38.442
Yeah, go for it.

02:29:40.080 --> 02:29:42.765
# I kill children, I wanna see 'em die!

02:29:43.760 --> 02:29:46.161
# I kill children to make their mamas cry

02:29:47.400 --> 02:29:50.768
# Crush 'em under my car
I wanna hear them scream

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:55.320
# Poison their Halloween candy
to ruin their Halloween #

02:29:55.400 --> 02:29:57.721
- That's awesome.
- Thank you.

02:29:57.840 --> 02:29:59.490
You're welcome.

02:30:00.280 --> 02:30:02.886
I'm gonna go to my room and play.

02:30:40.120 --> 02:30:42.122
Oh, yeah!

02:31:01.320 --> 02:31:02.731
Hey.

02:31:04.960 --> 02:31:06.920
Finally the bus is here.

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:08.560
- Is that a wild dog?
- I'm just high...

02:31:08.640 --> 02:31:12.000
- Get some decent air conditioning.
- She's sweating her ass off, too.

02:31:12.080 --> 02:31:13.650
I'll just take a picture of you guys.

02:31:13.760 --> 02:31:15.640
I would not wanna have dreads right now.

02:31:15.720 --> 02:31:18.166
I couldn't even fucking sell.
It's too hot.

02:31:19.360 --> 02:31:20.400
- Like this.
- How much'd you make?

02:31:20.480 --> 02:31:21.480
I didn't make shit.

02:31:21.560 --> 02:31:22.600
You didn't make nothing?

02:31:22.680 --> 02:31:24.200
- Take me from behind.
- Get away!

02:31:25.440 --> 02:31:27.727
I'm like, "Where do you think
you're going, bitch?"

02:31:29.480 --> 02:31:31.760
She's like, "Yeah! Yeah!"

02:31:46.320 --> 02:31:47.560
Jake's in the van.

02:31:55.600 --> 02:31:57.000
Where the fuck you been?

02:31:57.080 --> 02:31:58.923
Yeah, where the fuck you been, bro?

02:31:59.040 --> 02:32:01.240
- Hey, let's go.
- Running off like that.

02:32:30.720 --> 02:32:31.721
Yeah.

02:33:13.560 --> 02:33:16.280
# She grew up

02:33:16.360 --> 02:33:18.680
# On the side of the road

02:33:18.760 --> 02:33:24.480
# Where the church bells ring
and strong love grows

02:33:24.560 --> 02:33:30.120
# She grew up good, she grew up slow

02:33:30.200 --> 02:33:33.170
# Like American honey

02:33:35.800 --> 02:33:41.240
# Steady as a preacher, free as a weed

02:33:41.320 --> 02:33:43.920
# Couldn't wait to get going

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.960
# But wasn't quite ready to leave

02:33:47.040 --> 02:33:52.800
# So innocent, pure and sweet

02:33:52.880 --> 02:33:55.884
# American honey

02:33:58.280 --> 02:34:04.360
# There's a wild, wild whisper
blowin' in the wind

02:34:04.440 --> 02:34:09.560
# Callin' out my name
like a long-lost friend

02:34:09.640 --> 02:34:15.320
# Oh, I miss those days as the years go by

02:34:15.400 --> 02:34:20.600
# Oh, nothin' sweeter than summertime

02:34:20.680 --> 02:34:24.162
# And American honey

02:34:25.720 --> 02:34:31.480
# Get caught in the race
of this crazy life

02:34:31.560 --> 02:34:37.160
# Tryin' to be everything
can make you lose your mind

02:34:37.240 --> 02:34:43.080
# I just wanna go back in time

02:34:43.160 --> 02:34:46.243
# To American honey

02:34:48.600 --> 02:34:54.320
# There's a wild, wild whisper
blowin' in the wind

02:34:54.400 --> 02:34:59.880
# Callin' out my name
like a long-lost friend

02:34:59.960 --> 02:35:05.800
# Oh, I miss those days as the years go by

02:35:05.880 --> 02:35:10.800
# Oh, nothing sweeter than summertime

02:35:10.880 --> 02:35:16.560
# And American honey

02:35:16.640 --> 02:35:20.760
# Gone for so long now

02:35:20.840 --> 02:35:25.528
# I gotta get back to her somehow

02:35:26.120 --> 02:35:30.205
# And American honey

02:35:32.320 --> 02:35:37.087
# And American honey #

02:35:48.400 --> 02:35:50.243
Hey, Krystal, where's the music?

02:35:53.040 --> 02:35:55.480
Let's go. Let's go.

02:35:58.000 --> 02:35:59.650
Whoo!

02:36:31.080 --> 02:36:34.084
I singed my goddamn eyebrows, bro.

02:36:35.305 --> 02:36:41.524
