WEBVTT

00:00.938 --> 00:03.139
Morgan Lewis. Cystic Fibrosis.

00:03.174 --> 00:04.273
He's ready.

00:04.308 --> 00:05.941
You collapsed during
your performance.

00:05.977 --> 00:07.442
Did you take anything?

00:07.478 --> 00:09.177
That stuff that was
in your shed.

00:09.212 --> 00:11.813
- Is this your mom's?
- I just think

00:11.848 --> 00:13.248
<i>- we should put it back.
- I do know</i>

00:13.283 --> 00:16.584
that my mom is crazy,
and she is a lawyer.

00:16.619 --> 00:19.387
Sid Thomas-Haye, gunshot wound
to the upper thigh.

00:19.422 --> 00:22.757
You came by Grady's place last
week, mouse ears.

00:22.793 --> 00:25.359
- I need you to get Sid out.
- That's not my problem.

00:25.395 --> 00:28.561
I think you're gonna do
what I'm asking you, Mary.

00:28.597 --> 00:30.475
- I'll take him from here.
- Two drug convictions

00:30.499 --> 00:31.865
plus a weapons charge,
that equals

00:31.901 --> 00:33.211
you making a deal
with the police.

00:33.235 --> 00:34.868
Come on, Grady.

00:36.172 --> 00:38.305
How I ended up risking my job,

00:38.340 --> 00:41.775
my life, my kid
to help a psycho drug dealer

00:41.811 --> 00:43.609
murder someone
right in front of me,

00:43.644 --> 00:45.845
and the only thing
I could think of is you.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.280
This is my number.

00:47.315 --> 00:50.582
If you need anything at all,
you just... you call, all right?

00:50.618 --> 00:52.785
Why'd you ask me here, Mary?

00:52.821 --> 00:54.921
Why did you come?

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074

01:09.469 --> 01:11.069
Hey.

01:11.104 --> 01:12.838
I thought you'd left.

01:12.873 --> 01:15.073
I did.

01:15.108 --> 01:16.808
Got coffee.

01:16.843 --> 01:20.777
I didn't know how you took it,
so I guessed black.

01:21.981 --> 01:24.915
Black is right.

01:31.190 --> 01:33.657
I know I called you last night,
but I shouldn't have.

01:33.692 --> 01:36.625
That's okay. I get it.

01:38.263 --> 01:40.596
Yeah, I get it, you know,

01:40.631 --> 01:44.167
harsh light of day and all.

01:47.272 --> 01:50.740
I just thought, I don't know,
we could hang out and talk.

01:52.809 --> 01:56.745
I kind of get the feeling that
you need someone to talk to.

01:58.983 --> 02:00.916
I can't.

02:00.951 --> 02:04.319
Are you working?

02:04.355 --> 02:06.922
Yep.

02:08.991 --> 02:11.658
Yeah, me too.

02:16.665 --> 02:20.001
Yeah, I kind of get the
feeling you're always working.

02:41.689 --> 02:43.989
The good news or the bad news?

02:44.025 --> 02:45.958
Bad news.

02:45.993 --> 02:47.426
We're out of muffins.

02:47.461 --> 02:49.295
Damn it.

02:49.330 --> 02:50.595
The good news?

02:50.631 --> 02:52.464
Troy Dixon was diagnosed

02:52.499 --> 02:54.800
with depression a few months
before his death.

02:54.835 --> 02:57.369
Based on this and the parallel
to the Ethan Grant case,

02:57.405 --> 03:00.371
I got approval for a wire.

03:00.407 --> 03:02.473
I'm gonna crack
this Desmond Bennett.

03:02.508 --> 03:05.944
Frank, Mary called me
last night.

03:10.450 --> 03:12.650
Tell me you did not have sex
with this woman again.

03:12.696 --> 03:13.929
I can get her to confess.

03:13.954 --> 03:17.087
Yeah? Is there truth serum
in your dick?

03:17.122 --> 03:18.788
You're a God damn
liability, man.

03:18.824 --> 03:20.790
Come on, man, she called me
because she was alone.

03:20.826 --> 03:23.093
She was afraid,
and for some reason,

03:23.128 --> 03:26.196
I don't know,
I make her feel safe.

03:26.231 --> 03:27.630
I will get her to talk.

03:27.666 --> 03:29.399
Do your damn job.

03:29.435 --> 03:32.369
Get a confession.

04:22.818 --> 04:26.619
What are you doing here?

04:26.654 --> 04:29.922
I love this view.

04:33.928 --> 04:35.728
Why are you here?

04:35.763 --> 04:37.630
Did you know that the penalty
for dealing pento

04:37.665 --> 04:39.565
is the most severe
in the legal system?

04:39.600 --> 04:42.234
More than heroin.

04:42.269 --> 04:45.570
When Des came and asked if
I could get him some pento,

04:45.605 --> 04:47.539
I thought, "That's odd."

04:47.574 --> 04:49.241
You know, it's not a drug people

04:49.276 --> 04:51.543
often use recreationally,

04:51.578 --> 04:53.648
but drug choice is subjective,

04:53.875 --> 04:56.814
and who am I to judge?

04:56.850 --> 04:58.782
But then one day, you showed up
at my door,

04:58.817 --> 05:01.152
and you were asking for pento.

05:01.187 --> 05:03.854
You, Dr. Mary Harris.

05:03.889 --> 05:05.322
Remember yesterday,
when I told you

05:05.358 --> 05:06.790
to leave me and my family alone?

05:06.825 --> 05:08.459
I meant it.

05:08.494 --> 05:09.993
Ooh.

05:10.029 --> 05:11.462
And what is pento used for?

05:11.497 --> 05:14.565
It's used for capital
punishment, euthanasia.

05:14.600 --> 05:16.999
Death.

05:17.035 --> 05:19.702
It's used for killing people.

05:19.737 --> 05:21.071
So here's what I think.

05:21.113 --> 05:23.746
I don't think Des
is using pento.

05:23.775 --> 05:25.867
In fact, I think
he's probably sober.

05:25.892 --> 05:27.710
He looks fantastic.

05:27.745 --> 05:30.480
But I think you and Des
have a little side business,

05:30.515 --> 05:33.014
where you're sending people off
into the long good-night.

05:33.050 --> 05:36.585
Grady, you really need to stop
messing with me.

05:36.620 --> 05:37.852
Why?

05:37.888 --> 05:40.850
Because it's making me
want to kill you.

05:46.263 --> 05:50.164
I don't think I've met anyone
like you in my life, Mary.

05:50.200 --> 05:53.301
I mean, you seem so straight,

05:53.336 --> 05:55.936
this perfect little doctor

05:55.972 --> 06:00.174
with an nice house and
pretty little daughters,

06:00.210 --> 06:04.345
but I see you, man, you are
right there on the edge.

06:04.380 --> 06:05.613
Yeah, I am.

06:05.648 --> 06:07.747
I mean, I like what you're
doing, it's good.

06:07.782 --> 06:11.851
It's a little dark,
but I'm into it.

06:11.886 --> 06:14.053
I want a cut.

06:14.089 --> 06:16.089
'Cause that's the way I work.

06:16.125 --> 06:18.448
So the next time you come to me
to buy pento,

06:18.473 --> 06:21.361
you be prepared to negotiate.

06:23.431 --> 06:25.531
Mary.

06:31.639 --> 06:33.905
<i>Hey, this is Jess.
Text me, it's faster.</i>

06:33.941 --> 06:37.743
Hey, Jess, it's me.

06:37.778 --> 06:39.612
You're not answering your phone.

06:39.647 --> 06:42.847
Maybe you're still mad at me.

06:42.882 --> 06:47.818
I just wanted to see...
make sure you're okay.

06:47.854 --> 06:49.220
If we're okay.

06:49.256 --> 06:51.422
Call me back, all right?

06:51.458 --> 06:53.924
Love you.

07:41.548 --> 07:43.114
Your shoes, dear.

07:43.139 --> 07:45.684
You need a new pair.
You're on your feet all day.

07:45.709 --> 07:47.909
- I know.
- Good shoes pay for themselves.

07:47.944 --> 07:49.810
Well, my money's tied up
at the moment.

07:49.845 --> 07:51.778
Annie?

07:51.814 --> 07:53.880
When you're done, come and
see me in the boardroom.

07:53.916 --> 07:55.649
The boardroom? Why so official?

07:55.685 --> 07:57.351
It's confidential.

07:57.386 --> 07:58.752
Am I getting a raise?

07:58.787 --> 08:01.788
No.

08:57.342 --> 08:58.808
Hey.

08:58.843 --> 09:00.343
It's, Detective Wesley.

09:00.379 --> 09:02.612
I need you to do a local check
for me, okay?

09:02.648 --> 09:06.283
It's north of the city.
876 Bridgton Road.

09:07.819 --> 09:10.754
Call me back with it, okay?

09:34.177 --> 09:36.577
You know you're aiming
for the can, right?

09:36.613 --> 09:37.845
Well, then, show men.

09:37.880 --> 09:39.414
You just have to be
one with the gun.

09:39.449 --> 09:40.782
It's an extension of you.

09:40.817 --> 09:44.752
Just... just be the gun.

09:49.157 --> 09:50.762
Mary.

09:53.995 --> 09:55.362
What are you doing here?

09:55.397 --> 09:56.797
Who is this?

09:56.832 --> 09:57.798
Who are you?

09:57.833 --> 09:59.566
Is that gun registered?

09:59.601 --> 10:00.967
What are you, a cop?

10:01.002 --> 10:03.113
Ben, Nicole. Nicole, Ben.

10:03.144 --> 10:04.403
My sister.

10:04.439 --> 10:06.496
My... stalker.

10:07.642 --> 10:11.009
Yep, he's a cop.

10:11.045 --> 10:13.045
Mary, Mary.

10:13.080 --> 10:17.015
What have you gotten
yourself into?

10:22.929 --> 10:25.132
You realize you're trespassing, right?

10:25.484 --> 10:26.716
Yeah, I do.

10:26.752 --> 10:27.952
So why are you following me?

10:27.987 --> 10:30.687
We said good-bye, decided this
was a mistake, remember?

10:30.722 --> 10:33.424
I remember, I just...

10:33.458 --> 10:37.592
don't really care.

10:37.627 --> 10:40.128
What's with the gun?

10:40.165 --> 10:43.499
It's a new hobby.

10:43.534 --> 10:46.469
Are you in some kind of danger?

10:51.741 --> 10:53.741
All right, listen.

10:53.777 --> 10:56.210
The hardest thing about
shooting a weapon

10:56.245 --> 10:58.545
is controlling
your subconscious.

10:58.581 --> 11:00.881
So just relax.

11:00.916 --> 11:02.283
Okay?

11:02.318 --> 11:05.853
Breathe.

11:05.888 --> 11:06.903
Aim.

11:10.226 --> 11:11.858
When you're ready,

11:11.893 --> 11:13.893
slow and steady,

11:13.928 --> 11:16.863
pull the trigger.

11:18.934 --> 11:22.169
Am I making lunch
for two or three?

11:22.205 --> 11:24.171
Three.

11:41.489 --> 11:45.156
That's a '63 Vintage Telecaster.

11:45.191 --> 11:47.958
You play?

11:47.995 --> 11:50.362
Always wanted to,
but I never found the time.

11:50.398 --> 11:53.298
Yeah, time is funny that way?

11:53.333 --> 11:57.268
There's either too little
or way too much.

12:05.412 --> 12:07.478
That's nice.

12:07.513 --> 12:09.546
What is it?

12:09.582 --> 12:11.315
"In My Time of Dying."

12:16.689 --> 12:19.589
So...

12:19.624 --> 12:23.860
You're a progressive
end-of-life counselor?

12:23.895 --> 12:25.328
Yeah.

12:25.363 --> 12:27.430
We like to think of ourselves
as a...

12:27.465 --> 12:29.565
an alternative
to palliative care.

12:32.171 --> 12:34.404
Your, your file says that
you were diagnosed

12:34.439 --> 12:36.671
with cystic fibrosis
when you were two?

12:36.707 --> 12:38.574
Yeah.

12:38.608 --> 12:40.675
I was born sick.

12:40.710 --> 12:42.143
Born broken.

12:42.179 --> 12:44.130
Wasn't supposed to make it
this far.

12:44.155 --> 12:47.183
You're 33, right?

12:47.217 --> 12:49.150
You've already beat the odds.

12:50.854 --> 12:52.521
You ever consider
a lung transplant?

12:52.557 --> 12:56.291
Was at the top of the list
two months ago.

12:56.325 --> 12:59.326
Doctor said I was too sick.

12:59.361 --> 13:02.963
I wouldn't survive the surgery.

13:02.999 --> 13:05.700
Yeah.

13:05.734 --> 13:06.933
I'm sorry.

13:06.970 --> 13:09.036
I've had a good run.

13:09.071 --> 13:12.238
Live fast, die young, you know?

13:12.273 --> 13:15.074
I mean, don't get me wrong, um,
I mean living's great.

13:17.645 --> 13:20.580
I'm just ready.

13:23.552 --> 13:26.520
Okay.

13:26.554 --> 13:30.188
Okay.

13:30.224 --> 13:32.330
I'm gonna have to talk
to my colleague.

13:32.355 --> 13:33.722
We'll figure out a time.

13:35.662 --> 13:39.097
We will help you.

13:41.169 --> 13:43.068
Thanks, man.

13:48.474 --> 13:51.408
Where is your colleague?
I thought she'd be here.

13:51.445 --> 13:55.413
She's busy today.

13:55.448 --> 13:57.615
Actually...,

13:57.650 --> 14:00.917
we had a fight.

14:01.986 --> 14:05.788
I'm sorry.

14:05.823 --> 14:08.873
I'm sure she'll be here
for the main event.

14:11.929 --> 14:15.465
You should apologize.

14:15.500 --> 14:18.200
Take it from a dying man.

14:18.235 --> 14:21.637
Sometimes friends are the only
things that keep you going.

14:25.710 --> 14:27.677
Thanks.

14:53.969 --> 14:55.503
In all my years
working in hospitals,

14:55.537 --> 14:57.470
I've never had to deal
with like this.

14:57.506 --> 14:59.439
Excuse my language.

14:59.475 --> 15:00.808
What's going on?

15:00.843 --> 15:02.718
We need to talk about
Sid Thomas-Haye,

15:02.743 --> 15:05.245
the patient who disappeared
yesterday.

15:05.281 --> 15:06.780
I don't know anything
about that.

15:06.816 --> 15:09.083
Well, we're working alongside
the police, who are idiots,

15:09.117 --> 15:10.849
doing an internal investigation.

15:10.884 --> 15:13.552
So I'm gonna ask you
a few questions.

15:13.589 --> 15:16.089
Sure. Ask away.

15:16.124 --> 15:20.560
Sid was transferred from
the ER to ICU, correct?

15:20.596 --> 15:23.162
Correct.

15:25.234 --> 15:29.235
And the transfer was requested
by Dr. Mary Harris?

15:29.270 --> 15:30.736
Yeah.

15:30.771 --> 15:32.571
But his injuries
weren't life-threatening.

15:32.606 --> 15:35.440
So why did Dr. Harris transfer
him to intensive care?

15:35.476 --> 15:37.543
I don't know.

15:37.577 --> 15:39.009
I'm a nurse.

15:39.045 --> 15:42.847
I do what I'm told.
I take instruction.

15:42.883 --> 15:47.385
You don't think that request
was just a little unusual?

15:49.456 --> 15:52.223
I really couldn't say.

15:52.258 --> 15:54.574
I barely know Dr. Harris.

16:00.733 --> 16:02.399
<i>You've reached Dr. Mary Harris.</i>

16:02.433 --> 16:04.467
<i>Leave a message.</i>

16:04.503 --> 16:06.336
So I met with Morgan.

16:06.371 --> 16:07.903
Nice guy. Musician.

16:07.938 --> 16:10.373
He wants to wave the white flag.

16:10.408 --> 16:11.707
So he gave me his guitar,

16:11.744 --> 16:15.712
a Tele-something or other,
as a deposit.

16:15.747 --> 16:18.713
Anyway, I thought I'd call,
see when you're available.

16:23.787 --> 16:26.554
You know what I was
thinking about?

16:26.590 --> 16:28.990
About how when two bucks fight...

16:29.025 --> 16:32.026
or anything with antlers,
really...

16:32.061 --> 16:34.695
you know, sometimes they get
their antlers locked together.

16:34.730 --> 16:36.930
And they can't unlock them, and

16:36.965 --> 16:39.600
they can't live like that,

16:39.635 --> 16:42.269
so they both just die.

16:42.305 --> 16:45.372
Locked together.

16:45.408 --> 16:47.541
I don't know, point being,

16:47.576 --> 16:50.010
if they lock antlers,

16:50.045 --> 16:51.877
they both go down.

17:23.910 --> 17:25.742
You got me, Officer.

17:25.778 --> 17:28.546
I was talking on the phone.
Old habits die hard.

17:28.582 --> 17:31.149
Desmond Bennett.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.217
Do I know you?

17:32.252 --> 17:34.085
I'm Detective Frank Gaines.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.755
Is there a problem,
Detective Frank Gaines?

17:36.790 --> 17:38.835
I'm going to need you to come
with me to the station.

17:38.859 --> 17:40.425
For talking on the phone?

17:40.461 --> 17:42.760
Please, step out of the car.

17:42.794 --> 17:45.662
Come on. Let's go.

17:45.698 --> 17:47.164
No, thanks.

17:47.199 --> 17:50.968
I'm afraid I'm going to
have to insist on it.

17:51.003 --> 17:52.169
What's going on?

17:52.204 --> 17:53.537
I'll explain on the way.

17:53.573 --> 17:54.605
Am I under arrest?

17:54.640 --> 17:55.850
If it'd make it easier for you,

17:55.874 --> 17:59.308
I can do that.

18:02.913 --> 18:03.687
No.

18:03.718 --> 18:05.614
No, this is bullshit.
This is harassment.

18:05.649 --> 18:06.927
I'm not going anywhere with you.

18:06.951 --> 18:09.352
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

18:09.387 --> 18:11.253
Tried to do this the nice way,
but,

18:11.288 --> 18:14.723
we can do it the hard way.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.566
Here you go, mate.

18:27.239 --> 18:29.705
It's fabulous.

18:29.741 --> 18:32.408
Gourmet.

18:32.443 --> 18:34.677
You a football fan?

18:34.712 --> 18:37.279
And I don't mean that English
"Footy" bullshit.

18:37.314 --> 18:39.682
I mean pigskin, cheerleader,

18:39.717 --> 18:42.017
pompon football.

18:42.052 --> 18:45.287
Troy Dixon football.

18:45.322 --> 18:48.823
Yeah, yeah, we know about Troy.

18:48.859 --> 18:50.792
Listen, look, I understand.

18:50.827 --> 18:52.137
You want to help people,
you know,

18:52.161 --> 18:53.828
end their pain and suffering.

18:53.864 --> 18:56.330
I went through it
with my grandpappy.

18:56.366 --> 18:59.100
Yeah his death dragged
on and on.

18:59.135 --> 19:00.968
I remember thinking, "I wish..."

19:01.004 --> 19:02.169
"I wish there was something,

19:02.205 --> 19:03.904
someone to help him."

19:05.307 --> 19:08.876
I am so sorry for your loss.

19:11.947 --> 19:14.080
Come on, Des.

19:14.116 --> 19:15.849
You and Mary, your business.

19:15.885 --> 19:17.584
Mary and I sometimes volunteer

19:17.620 --> 19:19.719
with people that are dying.

19:19.754 --> 19:22.121
We talk to them. That's all.

19:22.156 --> 19:23.890
Like how you talked
to my friend Joel?

19:23.925 --> 19:27.794
Is conversation against the law?

19:30.097 --> 19:33.065
You know, Mary was with
my partner last night.

19:33.100 --> 19:35.435
Yeah, yeah, she called him all
messed up about something.

19:35.470 --> 19:37.769
Just think you should know,
because

19:37.805 --> 19:41.673
I think you should know
the truth, Des.

19:45.746 --> 19:49.514
My partner, Ben...
that's his real name...

19:49.550 --> 19:51.950
he's one of the best
UC guys out there.

19:51.985 --> 19:53.984
He can crack anyone.

19:54.019 --> 19:57.755
By sleeping with them.

19:57.790 --> 19:59.857
If it helps, yeah.

19:59.892 --> 20:01.859
Yeah.

20:01.894 --> 20:03.994
Look, I'm saying,
how do you know that Mary

20:04.029 --> 20:08.466
isn't bearing her pretty little
soul to him right now?

20:11.903 --> 20:13.870
You should talk to me.

20:13.905 --> 20:16.377
I'm only trying to help you.

20:22.080 --> 20:24.046
Okay.

20:24.082 --> 20:27.583
Okay, I have a question.

20:27.618 --> 20:30.352
Shoot.

20:30.387 --> 20:33.321
Do you even need
a high school education

20:33.357 --> 20:37.332
to be a cop, or do they let
just anybody join?

20:41.532 --> 20:44.090
Gonna be telling jokes
when you're on trial for murder?

20:44.115 --> 20:47.368
Well, I mean, trials could
use more humor, right?

20:48.938 --> 20:51.839
I'd like a lawyer.

20:54.310 --> 20:57.745
Mary, what's going on?

20:57.780 --> 20:59.547
You only show up here
when something's wrong.

20:59.582 --> 21:00.915
That's not true.

21:00.950 --> 21:02.360
You want to learn
how to shoot a gun.

21:02.384 --> 21:04.283
You have a cop following you?

21:04.319 --> 21:06.853
Tell me.

21:06.889 --> 21:08.321
There's nothing to tell.

21:08.356 --> 21:10.721
Bitch, please.
I know when you're lying.

21:10.746 --> 21:13.292
You taught me how to lie,
remember?

21:17.900 --> 21:21.400
Okay, but you have to promise
to stay cool, all right?

21:21.435 --> 21:24.069
I was born cool.

21:24.104 --> 21:26.304
You were there.

21:26.340 --> 21:29.255
I started providing
a service for people.

21:29.280 --> 21:30.910
People who want to die.

21:30.945 --> 21:33.178
And I help them.

21:33.213 --> 21:35.880
I'm sorry, what?

21:37.951 --> 21:40.217
I kill people.

21:40.253 --> 21:41.519
How?

21:41.555 --> 21:43.521
There's a drug. It's fatal.

21:43.557 --> 21:45.149
- Mary...
- I know.

21:45.174 --> 21:47.792
I know.

21:47.827 --> 21:49.761
But these people need me, okay?

21:49.796 --> 21:52.629
No one else will help them.

21:52.665 --> 21:56.099
I'm a doctor, and it's medicine.

21:58.537 --> 22:01.337
Is he investigating you?

22:01.373 --> 22:03.339
Yeah.

22:03.375 --> 22:05.809
My God.

22:05.844 --> 22:07.544
This is bad.

22:07.580 --> 22:10.112
I mean, you could go to jail.
What about Jess and Cambie?

22:10.137 --> 22:12.387
Nicole, you said
you would stay cool.

22:13.618 --> 22:15.585
What are you gonna do?

22:26.163 --> 22:28.979
I was thinking maybe
we could go for a walk.

22:30.734 --> 22:32.968
Yeah. Sounds good.

22:38.809 --> 22:41.275
Okay, turn it.

22:42.980 --> 22:44.884
I'm gonna kill myself
from boredom.

22:44.909 --> 22:46.589
Okay, we need to plan an escape.

22:46.628 --> 22:49.083
Dad, can we go to the beach,
please?

22:49.118 --> 22:50.818
Beach?

22:50.853 --> 22:52.419
What are you talking about?

22:52.454 --> 22:54.454
You're learning fundamental
skills here.

22:54.490 --> 22:56.624
Yes, measure twice, cut once.

22:56.659 --> 22:58.191
I really have it for life.

22:58.227 --> 23:00.060
I promise.

23:00.096 --> 23:02.561
That's not reno-attire.

23:02.597 --> 23:04.163
- I know.
- I got called into work.

23:04.198 --> 23:05.865
My God, this is so unfair.

23:05.892 --> 23:08.361
You guys are making us
be child slaves

23:08.423 --> 23:10.302
on this beautiful summer day.

23:10.338 --> 23:14.007
All right, we are young,
and we are restless.

23:14.042 --> 23:15.665
- And dramatic.
- Yeah.

23:15.704 --> 23:17.143
No kidding.

23:17.178 --> 23:19.811
Look, we're pretty much done
here, so, um,

23:19.847 --> 23:23.115
can, you drop the girls
off at the beach?

23:25.786 --> 23:27.318
Yes.

23:27.354 --> 23:29.287
Let's go.

23:31.759 --> 23:34.992
So that's the house you
and your sister grew up in?

23:35.028 --> 23:36.293
Yeah.

23:36.328 --> 23:38.863
With your parents?

23:38.898 --> 23:41.565
Didn't I tell you
we were raised by wolves?

23:41.600 --> 23:45.269
So that's why you're so guarded.

23:45.304 --> 23:48.372
We lived there with my mother.

23:48.407 --> 23:51.142
She passed away when I was 16.

23:51.177 --> 23:52.909
Cancer.

23:52.944 --> 23:56.112
And Dad left long before.

23:56.148 --> 23:57.781
How about your parents?

23:57.816 --> 24:00.316
Janet and Gil Wesley,

24:00.351 --> 24:02.986
they are retired,
and they live in Florida.

24:03.021 --> 24:04.988
You ever been to Florida?

24:05.023 --> 24:07.991
No. No.

24:08.026 --> 24:11.660
Maybe we could go someday.

24:13.731 --> 24:15.263
Can I ask you something?

24:15.299 --> 24:16.999
Yeah, why not?

24:17.034 --> 24:19.612
How many people have you helped?

24:21.772 --> 24:23.172
I don't know what you mean.

24:23.207 --> 24:24.284
Okay, let me put it this way:

24:24.308 --> 24:25.907
How many people have you killed?

24:25.942 --> 24:29.510
How many people have you killed?

24:29.545 --> 24:31.312
Two.

24:31.347 --> 24:33.547
Two's a lot.

24:33.583 --> 24:34.548
Self-defense?

24:34.584 --> 24:35.584
Yeah.

24:38.021 --> 24:39.918
One of them wasn't, though.

24:41.891 --> 24:44.157
This undercover operation,

24:44.193 --> 24:45.759
I got pretty close
to this suspect,

24:45.794 --> 24:47.560
I got close to his family,

24:47.596 --> 24:51.765
and then he killed himself.

24:51.800 --> 24:54.667
Why do you count that?

24:54.703 --> 24:56.336
Because I became his friend,

24:56.371 --> 24:58.004
and then I sent him to jail,

24:58.040 --> 25:00.072
and that's where it happened.

25:00.108 --> 25:02.674
Many ways to kill a man.

25:02.710 --> 25:04.977
You didn't kill him.

25:05.012 --> 25:07.780
You couldn't save him either.

25:07.815 --> 25:09.481
It was his choice.

25:10.517 --> 25:12.024
Ethan Grant?

25:14.856 --> 25:16.720
Did he have a choice?

25:18.358 --> 25:20.191
I don't know who that is.

25:20.227 --> 25:23.054
Well, Ethan Grant is the son
of Lucas Grant.

25:23.079 --> 25:24.729
Judge Lucas Grant.

25:24.765 --> 25:27.799
And he believes
his son was murdered.

25:27.834 --> 25:32.237
You know, Ethan,
he had this journal.

25:32.272 --> 25:35.005
I mean, he didn't name names,
but he wrote about

25:35.040 --> 25:37.241
this doctor and this nurse
who were helping him out,

25:37.276 --> 25:40.043
and that's why
I went undercover.

25:41.113 --> 25:43.247
The thing is, Mary, I mean,

25:43.282 --> 25:45.916
there's no case,
'cause you're smart.

25:45.951 --> 25:47.517
You're good.

25:47.552 --> 25:49.019
But then,

25:49.054 --> 25:52.088
we came across Troy Dixon.

25:52.123 --> 25:54.290
And then this all got very real.

25:54.325 --> 25:55.892
You shouldn't be
telling me this.

25:55.927 --> 25:58.127
No, I shouldn't.
I shouldn't be telling you this,

25:58.163 --> 25:59.862
I shouldn't have seen you
last night,

25:59.898 --> 26:04.000
I shouldn't be here right now.

26:04.035 --> 26:05.334
Well, maybe you're here because

26:05.369 --> 26:08.436
you don't think
there should be a case.

26:10.908 --> 26:13.008
I'll let you get that.

26:19.783 --> 26:21.149
<i>- Yeah.
- Hey.</i>

26:21.185 --> 26:24.652
Did a search for you on that
address, 876 Bridgton Road?

26:24.688 --> 26:26.954
Yeah, all right, thanks.
I already know who lives there.

26:26.989 --> 26:28.689
<i>Yeah? Nicole Mitchell?</i>

26:28.724 --> 26:31.325
Mitchell, not... not Harris?

26:31.360 --> 26:34.795
No, definitely Mitchell.

26:34.831 --> 26:37.131
Okay, can you do a search
for any records

26:37.166 --> 26:38.933
on Mary Mitchell?

26:38.968 --> 26:41.001
<i>Sure thing.
I'll call if I find anything.</i>

26:41.037 --> 26:43.569
- Yeah, is... is Frank around?
- He has your boy

26:43.604 --> 26:45.771
Desmond Bennett in
the interrogation room.

26:45.807 --> 26:47.240
Okay, all right, um,

26:47.275 --> 26:51.477
get him to give me a call
when he's out, okay?

26:51.512 --> 26:54.113
I know all about you, Des.

26:54.149 --> 26:56.115
Big shot plastic surgeon,

26:56.151 --> 26:57.317
lost your license because

26:57.352 --> 26:58.884
you were operating
while you were high.

26:58.919 --> 27:00.518
I mean...

27:00.554 --> 27:04.289
It's hilarious, I mean, that's...
That's pretty funny, right?

27:04.325 --> 27:06.258
- Yeah, yeah.
- You make a living putting

27:06.300 --> 27:07.499
double-D's in 20-year-olds,

27:07.527 --> 27:09.166
and you can't even
get that right.

27:09.191 --> 27:10.137
Ha!

27:10.162 --> 27:12.630
I mean, come on.

27:12.666 --> 27:15.467
But here's the thing.
Here's the thing.

27:15.502 --> 27:18.502
Mary, I believe
she wants to help people.

27:18.537 --> 27:20.872
I do, I do, but you?

27:20.907 --> 27:23.241
Nah. Not that deep.

27:23.276 --> 27:26.480
You lost your job, and you found
out what Mary was doing,

27:26.505 --> 27:28.473
and you saw an opportunity.

27:28.498 --> 27:30.292
I mean, that's all these people
are to you.

27:30.317 --> 27:32.293
A steady stream of income.

27:32.318 --> 27:33.748
How pathetic.

27:33.773 --> 27:35.451
Wow. Staggering.

27:35.487 --> 27:40.190
You... you have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

27:40.225 --> 27:42.192
So... so you care?

27:42.227 --> 27:44.727
You're God damn
right that I care.

27:44.763 --> 27:47.630
You know, these people are...
Are in pain.

27:47.665 --> 27:51.166
And suffering. And scared.

27:51.202 --> 27:53.348
They're going through something
that most people

27:53.373 --> 27:55.371
are too afraid to even mention,
much less face.

27:55.396 --> 27:57.544
They... they need someone that...

27:57.569 --> 27:58.908
that they can talk to!

27:58.943 --> 28:01.576
They need someone...

28:01.612 --> 28:03.913
Yeah? What do they need?

28:03.948 --> 28:05.680
Help.

28:05.716 --> 28:08.616
And you help them,
don't you, Des?

28:08.651 --> 28:12.353
You help them.

28:12.389 --> 28:14.155
Gentlemen.

28:14.190 --> 28:16.958
This interrogation is over.

28:19.659 --> 28:22.479
So, on what grounds are
you holding Mr. Bennett.

28:23.042 --> 28:25.108
Nice shoes.

28:25.144 --> 28:26.476
Yes, they are.

28:26.512 --> 28:28.078
Too bad they don't come
in your size.

28:28.113 --> 28:29.779
I like you.

28:29.814 --> 28:31.348
- Don't talk.
- Okay.

28:31.383 --> 28:32.927
No, unless you want to charge
Mr. Bennett,

28:32.951 --> 28:34.729
and I don't think you do,
because then I would have to

28:34.753 --> 28:36.119
go into the whole SIU
investigation

28:36.155 --> 28:37.720
into your conduct last year.

28:37.756 --> 28:40.456
That kid who almost died
in your custody?

28:40.491 --> 28:44.460
You didn't have grounds
to hold him either, did you?

28:44.495 --> 28:45.994
Or you can do whatever you like,

28:46.030 --> 28:49.432
and I'll apply for
a habeas corpus.

28:49.467 --> 28:51.434
Fine.

28:51.469 --> 28:53.869
But before you start filling his
head with crazy ideas,

28:53.904 --> 28:55.904
I have an offer.

28:55.940 --> 28:59.107
Your client is a primary suspect
in a murder investigation.

28:59.142 --> 29:01.008
He doesn't have to be
if he cooperates.

29:01.044 --> 29:03.111
- Define "Cooperate."
- He wears a wire.

29:03.146 --> 29:04.912
Gathers evidence
against his partner.

29:04.948 --> 29:07.549
We offer him immunity.
Offer dies at midnight.

29:08.952 --> 29:10.751
We will get back to you.

29:10.787 --> 29:13.154
Do.

29:13.190 --> 29:14.888
Door?

29:14.923 --> 29:16.590
Mr. Bennett?

29:16.625 --> 29:18.258
Of course.

29:18.294 --> 29:20.894
I'll just... leave.

29:43.651 --> 29:45.218
- Ladies.
- Hey.

29:45.253 --> 29:47.153
I didn't know you'd
be here, Tristan.

29:47.188 --> 29:49.053
Yeah. Naomi texted me.

29:49.089 --> 29:50.288
Jeez!

29:50.324 --> 29:53.758
Said you guys needed to escape
from reno-jail?

29:55.229 --> 29:58.396
So, your mom

29:58.432 --> 30:00.332
is dating your dad, right?

30:00.367 --> 30:02.867
Yeah, they're all
in love and shit.

30:02.902 --> 30:05.869
So you guys are pretty much
sisters now?

30:05.904 --> 30:09.106
We... we're not like
sisters, no.

30:11.177 --> 30:13.054
Hey, look, this is that stuff
I was telling you about.

30:13.078 --> 30:15.979
- Let me see it.
- What are you doing with that?

30:16.015 --> 30:17.881
It's okay... I took too much
the first time.

30:17.916 --> 30:19.495
Yeah, yeah, you ended up
in the hospital.

30:19.519 --> 30:21.084
I looked it up, okay?

30:21.120 --> 30:24.420
And apparently,
if you only take a little bit,

30:24.456 --> 30:26.356
there's a euphoria.

30:27.725 --> 30:30.793
My... what the hell, Jess?
What is your problem?

30:30.828 --> 30:33.062
You have a death wish.

30:33.097 --> 30:36.266
I'm over it, okay?
I'm so over it!

30:41.338 --> 30:43.539
You good?

30:43.574 --> 30:45.507
Are you cool?

30:49.513 --> 30:51.480
Thank you.

30:54.552 --> 30:56.384
So.

30:56.419 --> 30:58.619
You're the best criminal lawyer
in the city.

30:58.655 --> 31:01.055
Yeah, some people think so.

31:01.090 --> 31:02.456
- Why?
- Well, because

31:02.492 --> 31:04.858
that's what I told Richard
I wanted.

31:04.894 --> 31:06.827
Yes, he told me that
he represented you

31:06.862 --> 31:08.362
in your malpractice suit.

31:08.398 --> 31:10.798
Which I lost.

31:10.833 --> 31:12.733
And now, you're being
investigated for murder.

31:14.035 --> 31:15.735
I'm having a very
litigious year.

31:16.871 --> 31:18.638
You know, this is such
bullshit, you know?

31:18.674 --> 31:20.318
They should be focusing
on real murderers...

31:20.342 --> 31:22.375
I'm gonna stop you right there.

31:22.411 --> 31:25.245
I only want to know
what I need to know.

31:25.280 --> 31:26.580
I'm gonna ask you
some questions,

31:26.615 --> 31:28.015
and I'm gonna give you
some options.

31:28.049 --> 31:29.716
All right?

31:31.018 --> 31:32.184
So the cops are investigating

31:32.220 --> 31:35.854
you and your partner for murder.

31:35.889 --> 31:37.456
Assisted suicide.

31:37.491 --> 31:39.725
That depends on
how you look at it.

31:39.760 --> 31:42.194
Now, hypothetically speaking,

31:42.230 --> 31:44.863
if there was any validity
to their claims,

31:44.898 --> 31:49.267
and you were out there
helping people die,

31:49.302 --> 31:51.902
you're doing this what, out of
the goodness of your heart?

31:51.938 --> 31:54.272
That, and a...

31:54.307 --> 31:57.842
one-time fee of $10,000.

31:57.877 --> 32:01.312
That complicates things.

32:01.348 --> 32:03.180
Are these people terminally ill?

32:03.216 --> 32:04.648
Yeah.

32:04.683 --> 32:06.383
Well, a few could be debated,

32:06.418 --> 32:10.120
which is the nature
of the problem.

32:10.155 --> 32:13.957
Which brings us back
to our immunity offer.

32:13.992 --> 32:17.427
Would you consider wearing a
wire on your partner?

32:19.965 --> 32:21.464
I don't think I could do that.

32:21.499 --> 32:23.716
Do you think your partner
would say the same?

32:28.105 --> 32:29.938
In my experience,
an offer like this

32:29.974 --> 32:31.615
goes to the most willing party.

32:33.844 --> 32:35.944
So, you have until midnight

32:35.980 --> 32:38.274
to decide whether that's
going to be you

32:38.299 --> 32:39.807
or him.

32:46.055 --> 32:48.388
So, how was your walk?

32:50.994 --> 32:52.888
Wow, it was that good?

32:54.665 --> 32:56.363
What do you do, Nicole?

32:56.399 --> 32:58.699
I make people beautiful.

32:58.734 --> 33:00.301
Hair, esthetics.

33:00.336 --> 33:02.836
I have a salon in the house,
pays the bills.

33:02.871 --> 33:05.406
Kind of.

33:05.441 --> 33:08.008
So how did you two meet, anyway?

33:08.043 --> 33:09.677
It's a long story.

33:09.712 --> 33:11.077
I have time.

33:11.113 --> 33:15.548
Well, your sister was
actually my doctor.

33:16.618 --> 33:19.118
A doctor-patient relationship?

33:19.153 --> 33:20.920
That's very unethical.

33:20.955 --> 33:24.390
- Yeah, it is.
- Very unethical.

33:24.426 --> 33:27.092
What was wrong with you, Ben?

33:27.128 --> 33:29.961
I had cancer.

33:31.031 --> 33:33.264
You had cancer?

33:33.300 --> 33:36.267
And it was really bad.
I thought he was gonna die.

33:36.303 --> 33:38.903
It was awful.

33:41.975 --> 33:43.431
Then he got better.

33:44.678 --> 33:45.782
Yeah.

33:47.532 --> 33:49.532
And then you fell in love.

33:55.655 --> 33:57.421
I got to take this.

33:57.457 --> 34:00.891
Excuse me.

34:00.926 --> 34:03.360
Just one second.

34:06.130 --> 34:09.130
<i>Mary Mitchell,
now known as Mary Harris.</i>

34:09.167 --> 34:11.033
<i>She changed her name at 18.</i>

34:11.069 --> 34:13.469
Was investigated for
the murder of her mother.

34:13.505 --> 34:15.271
No, her mother died of cancer.

34:15.306 --> 34:17.873
Ben, her mother was found
dead in Chalk Lake

34:17.909 --> 34:19.598
with her hands tied together.

34:25.483 --> 34:28.183
He likes you, and you like him.

34:28.217 --> 34:30.252
And you, like, really like him.

34:30.286 --> 34:31.405
He's okay.

34:32.054 --> 34:33.983
I think you should
tell him the truth.

34:36.393 --> 34:38.192
- Why?
- Because he cares about you,

34:38.226 --> 34:40.360
and maybe he can help.

34:40.397 --> 34:42.196
Just tell him what you told me,

34:42.231 --> 34:44.399
that you're a doctor,
and it's medicine.

34:44.434 --> 34:46.701
That I get illegally
from a drug dealer,

34:46.735 --> 34:48.436
who's now threatening me.

34:48.471 --> 34:51.505
Yeah, all the more reason
to turn yourself in.

34:51.541 --> 34:53.686
Look, I know you think that
you can control everything,

34:53.710 --> 34:55.842
but you cannot control this.

34:55.878 --> 34:59.279
And murder investigations,
they don't go away easily.

34:59.314 --> 35:00.874
You know this.

35:05.521 --> 35:06.953
<i>There's a transcript.</i>

35:06.988 --> 35:10.390
Okay. Read it.

35:10.426 --> 35:13.893
"When did you
notice your mother was missing?"

35:13.928 --> 35:15.795
"In the morning."

35:15.830 --> 35:17.195
"What did you think happened?"

35:17.231 --> 35:18.864
"She killed herself."

35:18.900 --> 35:21.300
"But she was found
with her hands tied together.

35:21.335 --> 35:22.835
How could she have done that?"

35:22.870 --> 35:24.837
<i>"Can I please go?"</i>

35:24.872 --> 35:26.942
<i>"Did you tie her hands
behind her back?"</i>

35:26.967 --> 35:27.967
<i>"No."</i>

35:28.642 --> 35:31.643
"So you're saying she tied
her own hands?"

35:31.678 --> 35:33.812
"I tried to save her."

35:33.847 --> 35:35.613
<i>Goes on and on.</i>

35:35.649 --> 35:38.883
Okay, but, there wasn't enough?

35:38.919 --> 35:40.051
Not enough to charge her.

35:40.086 --> 35:41.920
But enough for her
to change her name.

35:41.955 --> 35:43.922
Ben, you don't know
who this woman is.

35:43.957 --> 35:45.423
<i>She's been involved in the death</i>

35:45.458 --> 35:47.691
<i>of God knows how many people.</i>

35:47.726 --> 35:49.493
<i>She... she preys on people.</i>

35:49.528 --> 35:51.762
<i>She's been doing this
since she was 16.</i>

35:51.797 --> 35:54.998
<i>Okay, she's lying to you.
She is manipulating you.</i>

35:56.704 --> 35:58.180
I'll call you back.

36:01.239 --> 36:02.712
I have to talk to you.

36:02.775 --> 36:04.189
Yeah, you do.

36:06.878 --> 36:09.111
I want to be honest with you.

36:09.146 --> 36:11.481
Good. Hold on.

36:11.516 --> 36:14.383
What are you doing?

36:16.454 --> 36:18.588
Mary Mitchell?

36:18.623 --> 36:22.156
Your mother didn't die
of cancer, did she?

36:24.051 --> 36:26.227
Why'd you lie?

36:26.262 --> 36:27.829
Because it's easier.

36:27.865 --> 36:31.366
Easier than what, telling
people that you killed her?

36:31.401 --> 36:32.579
Come on, Mary.
You want to be honest?

36:32.603 --> 36:34.836
Let's be honest. Be honest.
Come on.

36:34.872 --> 36:37.170
You think you get it,
but you don't.

36:37.206 --> 36:39.306
Okay.

36:39.341 --> 36:41.384
So explain it to me.

36:43.813 --> 36:45.779
I think you should go now.

36:47.917 --> 36:50.784
Know what's funny, Mary?

36:50.820 --> 36:52.620
I really thought I knew you.

36:52.655 --> 36:54.353
You do know me, Ben.

36:54.389 --> 36:55.399
No.

36:58.876 --> 37:00.313
Who are you?

37:05.233 --> 37:06.666
I'm Mary Harris.

37:06.701 --> 37:08.367
I'm an ER doctor.

37:08.403 --> 37:10.936
And I work at Eden
General Hospital.

37:28.999 --> 37:31.912
<i>You know sometimes they get
their antlers locked together.</i>

37:31.952 --> 37:35.721
<i>And they can't unlock them,
and they can't live like that,</i>

37:35.756 --> 37:37.889
<i>so they both just die.</i>

37:37.925 --> 37:40.157
<i>Locked together.</i>

37:40.192 --> 37:42.593
<i>I don't know, point being,</i>

37:42.629 --> 37:44.862
<i>if they lock antlers,</i>

37:44.897 --> 37:47.832
<i>they both go down.</i>

38:09.955 --> 38:13.222
You can get that.

38:15.893 --> 38:18.727
It's okay.

38:18.763 --> 38:19.806
So you want heroin.

38:19.831 --> 38:21.492
Yeah, you have
a problem with that?

38:21.517 --> 38:25.267
No, I only have a problem if
you're setting me up.

38:25.302 --> 38:27.703
I'm not setting you up, Grady.

38:27.738 --> 38:31.039
I'm trying to get high.

38:32.142 --> 38:35.609
Is this about my conversation
with Mary?

38:35.645 --> 38:36.844
You talked to Mary?

38:36.880 --> 38:39.213
I did. This morning.

38:39.248 --> 38:41.215
At her house.

38:42.752 --> 38:44.559
I know about your business,
yeah.

38:47.023 --> 38:48.918
It's okay, Des.

38:50.325 --> 38:53.122
Although, I am unhappy
that you lied to me.

38:54.096 --> 38:57.630
I think this might be
a really good thing for me.

38:57.666 --> 38:59.465
Like it was meant to be.

38:59.501 --> 39:01.702
I lose Sid,

39:01.737 --> 39:02.813
and then,

39:04.306 --> 39:06.125
I meet Mary, so...

39:06.867 --> 39:08.473
Bit fortuitous,
wouldn't you say?

39:08.509 --> 39:11.510
Yeah, yeah, well,
I'm done with Mary.

39:11.545 --> 39:13.825
Done with all of it.
I'm finished.

39:15.750 --> 39:17.099
Does she know that?

39:20.521 --> 39:22.645
I'm not like her.

39:23.957 --> 39:27.223
She's trying to help people,
fight the good fight.

39:34.334 --> 39:36.760
I'm just a junkie
looking for a fix.

40:08.366 --> 40:10.366
<i>You've reached Louise Malick,
attorney.</i>

40:10.401 --> 40:13.001
I'll take the deal.

40:26.784 --> 40:28.250
What happened?

40:28.285 --> 40:31.351
He asked about Mom.
I guess he found out.

40:31.387 --> 40:32.686
What did you tell him?

40:32.721 --> 40:34.621
Nothing.

40:34.657 --> 40:35.923
God.

40:35.958 --> 40:38.725
Some things never die.

40:38.761 --> 40:41.862
It'll die when we die.

40:41.898 --> 40:43.998
We killed her, and now he knows.

40:44.033 --> 40:46.733
No, we saved her, and you're
still saving people.

40:46.769 --> 40:50.036
I didn't tell you everything.
I charged them.

40:51.807 --> 40:53.572
- How much?
- $10,000.

40:53.608 --> 40:56.542
Jesus!

40:58.744 --> 41:00.650
People pay?

41:03.218 --> 41:05.951
You know, I don't think
I'm a very good person.

41:05.986 --> 41:07.419
Why, because you
provide a service,

41:07.454 --> 41:08.586
and people pay for it?

41:08.622 --> 41:09.928
Because I like it.

41:13.016 --> 41:17.395
It's hard to explain,
but there's something about it.

41:17.431 --> 41:19.164
Being with them
in their last moments,

41:19.200 --> 41:22.366
when everything matters
and doesn't matter.

41:22.401 --> 41:24.168
Mary, you need to stop.

41:24.204 --> 41:26.116
I don't want to stop.

41:27.907 --> 41:29.974
I think there's something
wrong with me.

41:30.009 --> 41:33.410
Well, I mean, yeah. Obviously.

41:33.446 --> 41:35.913
Maybe there's something wrong
with all of us.

41:35.949 --> 41:39.015
Am I crazy like Mom?

41:39.051 --> 41:40.583
No.

41:40.618 --> 41:43.553
You are nothing like her.

41:52.197 --> 41:53.964
What the hell, Nicole?

41:53.999 --> 41:58.033
I was just seeing if you still
had the will to live.

42:04.108 --> 42:05.640
You do.

42:23.039 --> 42:25.693
Watch the 2 hour Finale
Event of Mary Kills People.

42:25.711 --> 42:27.617
Next Wednesday on Global.

42:27.757 --> 42:29.545
Well look who it is.

42:29.547 --> 42:31.580
The angel of death.

42:31.781 --> 42:33.081
