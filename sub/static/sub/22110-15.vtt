00:36.886 --> 00:38.021
What the hell?

00:38.054 --> 00:41.057
Oh, hey, Brian.
I was sick of waiting my turn

00:41.091 --> 00:42.559
outside the supermarket,

00:42.592 --> 00:45.129
so I bought every coin-operated
horse in town.

00:45.162 --> 00:46.763
I assume you're on the unicorn?

00:46.796 --> 00:48.432
You know me well, sir.

00:48.465 --> 00:49.866
Must be a dozen horses here.

00:49.899 --> 00:51.268
How do you possibly
have the money

00:51.301 --> 00:52.536
for this type of stuff?

00:52.569 --> 00:54.771
Well, I'll tell you,
but only on one condition.

00:54.804 --> 00:56.973
-Fine. Never mind then.
-Investing!

00:57.006 --> 00:58.408
I invest in the stock market.

00:58.442 --> 00:59.943
The stock market? Ugh.

00:59.976 --> 01:01.945
What do you even know
about that stuff?

01:01.978 --> 01:04.814
It's easy-- I just follow trends
and invest accordingly.

01:04.848 --> 01:06.950
For instance,
there are more single people

01:06.983 --> 01:08.452
over 50 than ever.

01:08.485 --> 01:11.288
So I'm investing in handguns
and blackout window shades.

01:11.321 --> 01:13.423
They don't want to be part
of society, Brian.

01:13.457 --> 01:14.991
They've made that very clear.

01:15.024 --> 01:16.126
I don't know, Stewie,
if you ask me,

01:16.160 --> 01:17.894
the stock market's
just a rigged game

01:17.927 --> 01:20.230
where the top one percent
make out like bandits,

01:20.264 --> 01:21.631
and regular people get hurt.

01:21.665 --> 01:23.567
Are you reading off
a teleprompter right now?

01:23.600 --> 01:26.002
-No.
-(teleprompter crackles)

01:26.035 --> 01:27.604
The prompter's down.
What do we do?

01:27.637 --> 01:28.972
Brian, vamp!

01:29.005 --> 01:32.142
So, great to be in Quahog,
Rhode Island today.

01:32.176 --> 01:34.444
That's why he's the best.

01:38.648 --> 01:41.318
Our top story,
an austere monetary policy

01:41.351 --> 01:43.653
has the European Union
on the brink of collapse,

01:43.687 --> 01:45.589
threatening the entire
global economy.

01:45.622 --> 01:48.658
And for viewers making
less than $40,000 a year,

01:48.692 --> 01:52.162
your top story is a big
UFC fight this Saturday.

01:52.196 --> 01:53.963
Wow, I can't wait
to see that fight!

01:53.997 --> 01:55.832
Me and the guys are gonna
watch it at the Clam.

01:55.865 --> 01:58.134
Peter, we have dinner
with my parents that night.

01:58.168 --> 02:00.837
It's my mom's birthday.
You have to be there.

02:00.870 --> 02:02.672
Lois, if you let me out of this,

02:02.706 --> 02:05.108
I will go to Meg's
ballet recital in your place.

02:05.141 --> 02:06.376
Deal.

02:06.410 --> 02:08.378

02:08.412 --> 02:10.414
♪

02:11.881 --> 02:14.484
PETER:
I did not go to the recital.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.723
Whew, what a day.

02:19.756 --> 02:22.392
I asked Ms. Watson if she had
any kids of her own.

02:22.426 --> 02:25.295
Immediately, she put me
in a time-out.

02:25.329 --> 02:27.197
What the hell?!

02:27.231 --> 02:29.065
Ay, díos mio!

02:29.098 --> 02:30.667
Oh, great.
Course it's one of them.

02:30.700 --> 02:32.502
-What?!
-Stewie, adults are allowed

02:32.536 --> 02:34.838
to say racist things
because of traffic.

02:34.871 --> 02:37.707
Oh, my poor '98 Toyota Corolla.

02:37.741 --> 02:40.644
We all have
'98 Toyota Corolla.

02:40.677 --> 02:43.213
-Qué?
-I allowed to say racist things

02:43.247 --> 02:45.315
because of traffic.

02:45.349 --> 02:47.050
Well, don't get so angry.
Just tell your insurance

02:47.083 --> 02:48.552
what happened
and then they'll...

02:48.585 --> 02:50.587
Oh, you're driving away because
you don't have insurance.

02:50.620 --> 02:54.224
This sucks. Fixing the bumper
is gonna cost at least a grand.

02:54.258 --> 02:55.659
Tell you what,
give me a hundred bucks

02:55.692 --> 02:57.894
to put in the stock market,
and I'll take care of it.

02:57.927 --> 02:58.895
The market?

02:58.928 --> 03:00.364
Brian, you won't lose
your money.

03:00.397 --> 03:01.431
I promise.

03:01.465 --> 03:03.166
(sighs)
All right, fine.

03:03.199 --> 03:05.935
Guess I'm not the first person
to cave in to family pressure.

03:05.969 --> 03:07.737
Like Stephen Baldwin.

03:07.771 --> 03:10.073
Why aren't you a bloated
alcoholic yet?

03:10.106 --> 03:12.476
I'm sorry, Ma!

03:19.283 --> 03:20.917
What the hell?

03:20.950 --> 03:23.920
Jerome, what are you doing?
The fight's tonight!

03:23.953 --> 03:26.089
Sorry, fellas,
I just got a call.

03:26.122 --> 03:27.591
My mom had a stroke.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.626
I've got to go back
to Long Island to see her.

03:29.659 --> 03:31.060
Hey, a Mets fan, huh?

03:31.094 --> 03:32.696
No, no, Joe,
now is not the time

03:32.729 --> 03:34.631
to use your new
conversation techniques.

03:34.664 --> 03:37.401
I love her so much.
Look at her.

03:37.434 --> 03:39.869
So beautiful.

03:39.903 --> 03:41.538
And there's no one
to take care of her,

03:41.571 --> 03:44.073
so, unfortunately,
I'll be gone for a while.

03:44.107 --> 03:46.142
I got to close this place
for a month.

03:46.175 --> 03:48.278
-A month?!
-I wish it was February.

03:48.312 --> 03:50.780
'Cause, you know,
that's the shortest month.

03:50.814 --> 03:52.782
Nice one, Joe.
You're on the board.

03:52.816 --> 03:54.951
Look, I don't want to
close the place either.

03:54.984 --> 03:56.653
But I don't have anyone
to run it.

03:56.686 --> 03:59.122
Really?
Well, uh, you know,

03:59.155 --> 04:00.757
we know this place
better than anyone.

04:00.790 --> 04:02.392
-What if we run it for you?
-Yeah!

04:02.426 --> 04:04.461
-That's a great idea!
-B-story!

04:04.494 --> 04:07.631
Wow, you fellas would really
watch this place for me?

04:07.664 --> 04:09.933
Are you kidding?
Running a bar is my dream!

04:09.966 --> 04:12.268
Well, that and waking up
a rooster.

04:17.707 --> 04:19.476
-Dah!
-(squawks loudly)

04:19.509 --> 04:21.378
Enjoy the rest of your Saturday.

04:26.282 --> 04:27.684
Hey, Brian,
I need to talk to you

04:27.717 --> 04:29.486
about that money
I invested for you.

04:29.519 --> 04:31.321
I knew it.
You lost it all, didn't you?

04:31.355 --> 04:32.856
God, I never should have
given you my money.

04:32.889 --> 04:35.825
The stock market is a sucker's
bet, like chasing your tail.

04:35.859 --> 04:38.495
God, it's right there,
and yet a million miles away.

04:38.528 --> 04:39.996
What are the physics of that?!

04:40.029 --> 04:42.799
I didn't lose your money, Brian.
Quite the contrary.

04:42.832 --> 04:44.834
Here's a thousand
to fix your car.

04:44.868 --> 04:46.336
And here's a thousand profit.

04:46.370 --> 04:47.837
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

04:47.871 --> 04:50.340
You made $2,000
in a couple days?

04:50.374 --> 04:52.041
-Yep.
-Oh, my God.

04:52.075 --> 04:53.977
You got to teach me
how to invest.

04:54.010 --> 04:56.513
Okay, but I can see this is
going to be a lot of work.

04:56.546 --> 05:00.149
So in return,
you must teach me Gymkata:

05:00.183 --> 05:02.986
the fusion of gymnastics
and karate.

05:03.019 --> 05:06.456
No, Stewie, I won't do that.
It's too dangerous.

05:06.490 --> 05:08.958
I swore I'd never
teach Gymkata again.

05:08.992 --> 05:11.495
Brian, there's a 22-year-old
Mongolian heiress

05:11.528 --> 05:13.329
who's being held captive
in a mountain fortress

05:13.363 --> 05:15.198
that happens to have
a pommel horse in it.

05:45.228 --> 05:46.763
Why are you still wearing
that unitard?

05:46.796 --> 05:48.932
Can't get it off

Well, here, let me help you

Wow, good for you.
You're really taking to this.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.869

Together, we're going to
make a fortune.

Well, now, hold on, Stewie.
I'm not some run-of-the-mill

Here we go, next question.

08:59.255 --> 09:00.790
And remember, no phones, people.

09:00.824 --> 09:02.692
Playing an honest game,
no phones.

09:02.726 --> 09:04.193
Okay, "In what country..."

09:04.227 --> 09:06.195
No phones, I'm seeing phones.

09:06.229 --> 09:08.097
"In what country..."
No phones.

09:08.131 --> 09:10.033
I've been pretty cool
about this so far,

09:10.066 --> 09:11.367
it's a gentlemen's game.

09:11.400 --> 09:13.937
"In what country can you find
the monuments called..."

09:13.970 --> 09:15.438
I see phones. I see...
All right,

you know what, that's it,
trivia night over!

09:16.940 --> 09:18.875

I'll see you tomorrow.

12:13.616 --> 12:15.084
What are we gonna do?

12:15.118 --> 12:17.553
Yeah. When Jerome sees that
painting, he's gonna kill us.

12:17.586 --> 12:19.655
Don't worry, guys,
he's got another one over there.

12:19.688 --> 12:21.324

Bruno Mars?

Who's she?

12:23.526 --> 12:24.560
He's a man.

12:24.593 --> 12:25.829
And he's not even black.

12:25.862 --> 12:29.765
He's a beautiful,
mixed-up tomorrow person.

12:36.272 --> 12:37.506
What is this place?

12:37.540 --> 12:39.175
This is what you dragged me
out of the house

12:39.208 --> 12:40.576
first thing in the morning for?

12:40.609 --> 12:42.578
Yeah, it's a great company
I found to invest in.

12:42.611 --> 12:44.280
Korean.
They make protein shakes.

12:44.313 --> 12:45.949
The profits are off the charts.

12:45.982 --> 12:47.583
Well, why is it
in the middle of nowhere?

12:47.616 --> 12:49.285
And why are there no windows?

12:49.318 --> 12:51.120
And why is there
a security guard out front?

12:51.154 --> 12:52.621
All these questions?

12:52.655 --> 12:55.191
This is why I didn't want to
let you have a soda in the car.

12:55.224 --> 12:56.459
It's not 'cause of the soda.

12:56.492 --> 12:58.394
God.

13:04.467 --> 13:05.601
Something's going on here.

13:05.634 --> 13:07.470
I'm taking a look.

13:07.503 --> 13:09.638
What are you doing?
It's just a protein shake.

13:09.672 --> 13:11.574
And it's the cheapest
on the market.

13:15.311 --> 13:18.781
Uh, Brian, I think I know
why it's so cheap.

13:18.814 --> 13:22.185
They're made of dog meat.

said "shake,"

13:45.274 --> 13:46.475
I thought he meant my paw.

13:46.509 --> 13:48.311
Then he said
I was gonna be protein.

14:01.690 --> 14:02.926

14:10.233 --> 14:11.334
Oh, my God.

14:11.367 --> 14:13.002
Brian, you've turned
into a monster.

14:13.036 --> 14:14.170
HERRY MONSTER:
Hey!

14:14.203 --> 14:16.405
That's offensive
to the monster community.

14:16.439 --> 14:17.907
Yeah, some of us are nice.

14:17.941 --> 14:19.242
Yeah, real nice.

14:23.746 --> 14:26.349

was consensual.

14:26.382 --> 14:28.351
Yeah, but wasn't there another
case that was only thrown out

14:28.384 --> 14:30.519
because the statute
of limitations had expired?

14:30.553 --> 14:32.555
Elmo no comment.

14:34.790 --> 14:35.858
Cookie!

14:35.891 --> 14:37.193
(chuckling):
He wants a cookie.

14:37.226 --> 14:39.428
Oh, I love the Muppets.

14:45.334 --> 14:47.403
I can't believe you still
want to invest in this.

14:47.436 --> 14:48.737
They use dog meat.

14:48.771 --> 14:51.240
How can you condone
the eating of other dogs?

14:51.274 --> 14:52.908
Oh, come on, Stewie,
it's their way.

14:52.942 --> 14:54.810
Who are we to judge
other cultures?

14:54.843 --> 14:56.745
Look, I'm investing
in this company.

14:56.779 --> 14:58.547
And if you're too scared
to do it with me,

14:58.581 --> 15:00.149
then maybe I'm working
with the wrong partner.

15:00.183 --> 15:01.384
What are you talking about?

15:01.417 --> 15:02.952
I'm the one who taught you
how to invest.

15:02.986 --> 15:04.087
You can't ditch me.

15:04.120 --> 15:05.154
Sorry, Stewie.

15:05.188 --> 15:07.123
When I left you,
I was but a learner.

15:07.156 --> 15:09.725
Now I am the master.

15:09.758 --> 15:10.926
Hee-ya!

15:10.960 --> 15:13.296
Yeah. No one in Star Wars
says "hee-ya."

15:13.329 --> 15:14.630
You know what, Brian, forget it.

15:14.663 --> 15:16.499
We are done. You ruined this.

15:16.532 --> 15:19.435
We were a good team,
like Ricki and the Flash.

15:19.468 --> 15:20.970
I love you, Ricki.

15:21.004 --> 15:23.306
I love you, the Flash.

15:23.339 --> 15:24.940
Stewie, I don't think
that's right.

15:24.974 --> 15:26.409
Ah, I didn't see the movie.

15:26.442 --> 15:28.077
Yeah, no, I didn't see it
either, but, yeah, the,

15:28.111 --> 15:30.246
"the Flash" was the name
of her rock band.

15:30.279 --> 15:31.480
Oh, you saw it.

15:31.514 --> 15:32.915
Yeah, I saw it.

15:32.948 --> 15:34.950
So did I.

15:38.121 --> 15:40.456
-This is stupid. -Come on, guys.
We got no choice.

15:40.489 --> 15:42.992
We have to paint that portrait
of Jerome's mother ourselves,

15:43.026 --> 15:44.827
and this is
the only class in town.

15:44.860 --> 15:46.495
But aren't these classes
just for lame chicks

15:46.529 --> 15:49.265
who want an excuse
to drink together?

15:49.298 --> 15:52.135
(all laughing)

15:52.168 --> 15:53.302
I'm having so much fun.

15:53.336 --> 15:54.437
Me, too.

15:54.470 --> 15:56.172
This wine is an artist.

15:56.205 --> 15:58.441
And it painted my smile.

15:58.474 --> 16:01.110
(laughs, cries)

16:01.144 --> 16:03.979
I don't think Paul
really wants to marry me.

16:04.013 --> 16:05.981
-(wails)
-I, uh...

16:06.015 --> 16:08.484
I'm not sure
what we're doing now.

16:14.523 --> 16:15.958
Hi, Brian Griffin.

16:15.991 --> 16:19.128
I have an appointment to see
your CEO about an investment.

16:19.162 --> 16:21.530
Ah, yes, we're waiting for you.

16:21.564 --> 16:25.034
Here, breathe deeply
into this investors' rag.

16:25.068 --> 16:27.803
All right. Now, I'm not sure
if I'm saying this right,

16:27.836 --> 16:31.040
but, uh, "Boo. Cocky."

16:31.074 --> 16:33.076
(inhales)

16:36.845 --> 16:38.181
Can you believe Brian?

16:38.214 --> 16:40.716
Thinking he can fire me
when I'm the one who taught him?

16:40.749 --> 16:41.884
I have had it with him.

16:41.917 --> 16:43.152
Absolutely had it.

16:43.186 --> 16:44.487
He's just so selfish.

16:44.520 --> 16:45.821
He drives me crazy.

16:45.854 --> 16:48.091
I don't know why I put up
with it, I guess...

16:48.124 --> 16:51.094
I guess I just have
a forgiving personality.

16:51.127 --> 16:53.996
But enough about that, I'm
probably starting to bore you.

16:54.029 --> 16:56.899
It's just that whenever
I start talking about Brian,

16:56.932 --> 16:58.434
-I lose all track of time.
-(phone vibrating)

16:58.467 --> 17:00.236
You would think,
after all these years together,

17:00.269 --> 17:03.239
that I could simply tell myself
enough is enough.

17:03.272 --> 17:05.208
(dogs barking)

17:05.241 --> 17:07.176
STEWIE: You've reached Stewie
Griffin. Leave a message.

17:07.210 --> 17:09.245
-(line beeps)
-Hey! Give me that phone.

17:09.278 --> 17:11.347
Stewie, it's Brian, you got
to help me, I'm gonna get ea...

17:11.380 --> 17:13.382
Damn it.

17:13.416 --> 17:16.519
Well, I guess Stewie's
my only hope now.

17:16.552 --> 17:18.421
I can't believe
I might die like this.

17:18.454 --> 17:21.190
I always thought I'd go
the way all dogs dream about:

17:21.224 --> 17:24.393
slowly, and at great
inconvenience to my owners.

17:24.427 --> 17:25.961
Come on, boy. Here we go.

17:25.994 --> 17:28.464
Here we go. Let's get you
to the living room.

17:28.497 --> 17:29.732
(grunts)

17:29.765 --> 17:31.767
Lois, wrap one of his
"walking to the car" pills

17:31.800 --> 17:33.436
in roast beef and peanut butter.

17:33.469 --> 17:35.438
I'm gonna hold his hips
while he stands confused

17:35.471 --> 17:37.072
in front of the water dish.

17:37.106 --> 17:38.707
Go on, boy. It's right there.

17:38.741 --> 17:40.743
(sniffing)

17:43.912 --> 17:45.614
Come on, boy, it's right there.

17:45.648 --> 17:47.150
It's water. You like it.

17:49.918 --> 17:51.053
There you go.

17:51.086 --> 17:52.921
You're doing it yourself.

17:56.492 --> 17:58.294
Oh, God. Jerome's gonna be here
any minute,

17:58.327 --> 17:59.628
and then we're totally screwed.

17:59.662 --> 18:01.897
Well, I guess all we can do now
is the honorable thing:

18:01.930 --> 18:04.900
make realistic puppets
of ourselves to leave in the bar

18:04.933 --> 18:07.102
for Jerome to beat
the crap out of.

18:09.272 --> 18:11.073
JEROME: What the hell
happened to my bar?

18:11.106 --> 18:12.575
And my painting!

18:12.608 --> 18:14.443
Well, don't just sit there
staring at me

18:14.477 --> 18:17.513
with your limp limbs and
your straw-filled plaid shirts.

18:17.546 --> 18:20.249
(blows landing)

18:20.283 --> 18:21.684
Wow, it's working!

18:21.717 --> 18:23.018
Good plan, Peter.

18:23.051 --> 18:24.487
PUPPET PETER:
Thanks, guys.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.755
Oh, no, I left the real me
in there.

18:26.789 --> 18:28.824
He's falling for it, guys.

18:28.857 --> 18:30.493
He thinks I'm me.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.300
Come on, Stewie,
check your damn messages.

18:37.333 --> 18:40.436
(dog whimpering, barks)

18:40.469 --> 18:42.438
God, that must be
where they do the deed.

18:42.471 --> 18:45.241
I hope it's at least
peaceful and humane.

18:46.309 --> 18:48.010
GROUP:
Vick!

18:48.043 --> 18:49.845
Oh, boy.

18:49.878 --> 18:51.046
GROUP:
And Eli Manning!

18:52.481 --> 18:54.350
Aw, I didn't know that
about Eli Manning.

18:54.383 --> 18:56.819
Oh, yeah.
I'm a real idiot psychopath.

19:02.491 --> 19:03.692
What was that?

19:06.329 --> 19:07.496
What the...?

19:09.332 --> 19:10.799
Good job, Rupert.

19:10.833 --> 19:12.835
Now let's hope we can find Brian
before it's too late.

19:12.868 --> 19:14.570
BRIAN:
Hey, don't touch me, I'm rich!

19:14.603 --> 19:18.341
Ugh, he just makes it
so difficult to be on his side.

19:20.843 --> 19:23.979
Oh, come on, there's got to be
a way we can work this out.

19:24.012 --> 19:25.548

I guess I just lost my head.

Well, lesson learned, Brian.

Wow, Stewie. I am so sorry
I became such a jerk.

20:37.320 --> 20:39.588
But I guess I learned my lesson
about the evils of Wall Street.

20:39.622 --> 20:40.923
What are you talking about?

20:40.956 --> 20:42.425
This isn't about Wall Street,
this is about you.

20:42.458 --> 20:43.659
Me?

20:43.692 --> 20:45.093
I've been investing
in the market forever,

20:45.127 --> 20:46.261
and doing just fine.

20:46.295 --> 20:47.496
You did it for one week,

20:47.530 --> 20:49.765
and were literally eating
your own kind.

20:49.798 --> 20:51.099
This isn't about Wall Street.

20:51.133 --> 20:52.601
I cannot stress that enough.

20:52.635 --> 20:54.603
Well, money is
the root of all evil.

20:54.637 --> 20:56.104
No, it's not. It's just you.

20:56.138 --> 20:58.173
Hello, others, I am the father.

20:58.206 --> 20:59.342
Where is the mother,

20:59.375 --> 21:02.445
and what kind of sex
does she like to have?
