WEBVTT

00:12.137 --> 00:15.265
A special operations chief,
Edward Gallagher,

00:15.349 --> 00:18.352
stabbed a 15-year-old
ISIS prisoner to death.

00:18.435 --> 00:21.939
He's also accused of shooting
at Iraqi civilians on several occasions.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.816
He'd been decorated
with a chest full of medals,

00:24.900 --> 00:29.446
but today, Navy SEAL platoon leader,
Eddie Gallagher, wore shackles.

00:30.030 --> 00:33.158
Prosecutors claim
Gallagher took a photo with the corpse

00:33.242 --> 00:36.036
and sent it to friends
with messages such as,

00:36.119 --> 00:38.497
"I got this one with my hunting knife."

00:38.580 --> 00:42.501
This Navy SEAL, now charged
with premeditated murder.

00:44.169 --> 00:47.089
I got arrested,
and they handcuffed me,

00:48.215 --> 00:50.425
and then they brought me to the brig.

00:51.051 --> 00:55.097
And I'm like, "There is a huge mistake
going on here," because I don't know--

00:55.180 --> 00:57.558
I didn't understand what reason
they had to throw me in prison.

01:00.102 --> 01:03.230
I walked in,
these guards were staring at me,

01:03.313 --> 01:05.691
and they even asked me,
"Do you know why you're here?"

01:06.191 --> 01:08.318
And I was like, "No."

01:08.402 --> 01:11.029
They were like, "Well, what do you think?"

01:11.572 --> 01:15.242
And I said, "What, for killing ISIS?"
And they were like, "Yeah."

01:17.786 --> 01:20.205
I said it as a joke,
but when they were like, "Yeah."

01:20.289 --> 01:23.625
I was like, "Okay, what the fuck?"

01:24.501 --> 01:28.297
I hadn't been charged with anything.
Nothing was brought up to me.

01:29.339 --> 01:31.884
At that point, I was in survival mode,

01:31.967 --> 01:35.012
just trying to figure out,
how did this happen?

01:35.721 --> 01:37.055
Why am I here?

01:39.141 --> 01:40.684
How can I get out of here?

01:47.524 --> 01:49.860
We're here to train and go to war.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.904
I was like, "Hell yeah. Let's do this."

01:54.531 --> 01:57.326
These men were my family, my brothers.

01:57.409 --> 01:58.869
This bond of warfighters.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.375
You could just tell
that something was off.

02:06.168 --> 02:08.586
There was this undercurrent
in this platoon.

02:12.799 --> 02:15.594
How do you sleep at night
knowing what you did?

02:16.595 --> 02:18.889
I just saw it as good versus evil.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.516
It's that simple.

02:41.119 --> 02:43.580
This is a prepaid call from…

02:43.664 --> 02:44.748
Eddie.

02:44.831 --> 02:48.377
A prisoner
at the Naval Consolidated Brig at Miramar.

02:48.460 --> 02:50.754
To accept this call, press five now.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.382
-Hey, baby.
-Hi, Dad.

02:54.299 --> 02:55.717
Hey.

02:55.801 --> 02:57.511
-Hi, baby.
-What are you guys doing?

02:57.594 --> 03:01.306
Nothing.
I was gonna let Ryan answer it.

03:01.390 --> 03:02.766
Hey, bud.

03:02.850 --> 03:03.851
Hi.

03:04.643 --> 03:06.770
-What are you up to?
-Nothing.

03:07.354 --> 03:08.814
From when he got taken,

03:08.897 --> 03:13.819
it was just a crash course
in how to save a life, basically.

03:15.362 --> 03:19.658
There's no road map to guide you
when you're in a situation like this.

03:20.158 --> 03:21.827
You don't know how to wade through it.

03:22.661 --> 03:25.789
I wanted to
lay down on the floor and cry.

03:26.290 --> 03:29.626
I was at the point of exhaustion
and couldn't go any further.

03:30.669 --> 03:34.006
Imagine talking to a person
in the saddest, darkest place…

03:36.091 --> 03:38.802
and it is impossible to pull them out.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.889
It's not as if, when he's on the phone
with me in the brig,

03:41.972 --> 03:43.724
I can say, "Hey, cheer up, bucko."

03:43.807 --> 03:45.392
And the accusations were serious.

03:46.059 --> 03:49.021
Eddie's charge sheet was long
and it was harrowing.

03:49.104 --> 03:54.067
It's that first thing you see that says,
"United States government v. Gallagher."

03:55.152 --> 03:58.280
I'm like, "Fuck.
United States versus Gallagher. Fuck."

03:59.448 --> 04:03.660
I was scared. They could send Eddie
to prison for the rest of his life.

04:03.744 --> 04:07.372
This is not even a fog of war
judgment call kind of situation.

04:07.456 --> 04:09.875
These are premeditated,
cold-blooded murders.

04:09.958 --> 04:12.794
It gives everyone a bad name,
every veteran that served.

04:12.878 --> 04:15.714
This guy was a serial killer
who was in the military

04:15.797 --> 04:18.675
so he could do it in legal ways.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.260
The most damning thing about it is it--

04:20.344 --> 04:23.931
How rare is it for SEAL team members
to actually come out publicly?

04:24.014 --> 04:27.309
When professional killers say
that someone's killing too much,

04:27.392 --> 04:29.061
we should lean in and listen.

04:29.144 --> 04:32.481
Eddie gets arrested,
and it hits the newswire right away.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.068
Eddie Gallagher, arrested.

04:36.151 --> 04:38.195
You know, they push the narrative

04:38.278 --> 04:44.451
of this man was killing children,
women, old people, indiscriminately.

04:44.535 --> 04:48.789
This man cut off
the head of an ISIS fighter.

04:48.872 --> 04:50.791
I'm having my family hit me up,

04:50.874 --> 04:54.002
sending me articles
about this guy that I know saying,

04:54.086 --> 04:57.589
"Look at how horrible this is,"
not realizing that I was there,

04:57.673 --> 04:59.675
not realizing that I'm in that photo.

05:01.885 --> 05:06.306
I need to understand the reality
of what's going on here.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.310
But I say, you know what?

05:10.394 --> 05:13.856
I hate to do this,
but I need to go talk with Eddie.

05:17.818 --> 05:21.738
This dude is on CNN as a war criminal,

05:21.822 --> 05:24.241
and I'm going in there visiting him.

05:25.117 --> 05:27.494
This isn't a good career choice.

05:27.578 --> 05:31.623
This isn't a good thing to do other than
that it was the right thing to do.

05:34.835 --> 05:38.422
I put on my dress uniform,
I went down there,

05:38.505 --> 05:40.549
and I signed myself into the brig.

05:45.470 --> 05:48.849
Gio came to visit me,
which I was surprised about.

05:49.558 --> 05:50.976
I was very paranoid.

05:51.476 --> 05:55.522
I played it cool, but I was like,
I don't trust anybody at this point.

05:55.606 --> 05:59.818
If people came to visit me, I'm like,
I don't know if you're, you know,

05:59.902 --> 06:03.822
some pawn being sent here to
get information and go back or what.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.869
And I just laid it out to him.
Like, "Listen, I'm here for the truth."

06:09.411 --> 06:11.121
And we sit down,
and we have a conversation.

06:12.706 --> 06:16.543
We started to pick apart
these changing stories from the platoon.

06:17.336 --> 06:20.881
Well, this is what he said, and this is
what he said. And this is where he was.

06:20.964 --> 06:23.884
I'm just like,
"Well, that's not what happened."

06:26.345 --> 06:29.014
I know that he's not
shooting civilians in Iraq.

06:29.097 --> 06:31.600
I was there each and every single day.

06:32.601 --> 06:37.147
Never once during the course of that
deployment does any of these guys say,

06:37.231 --> 06:39.483
"Eddie Gallagher
purposely killed a civilian today."

06:40.150 --> 06:42.486
Dille: Get ready, Eddie.
He just poked his bean out.

06:43.695 --> 06:45.280
That never took place.

06:45.364 --> 06:47.533
And believe me, if it ever did,

06:47.616 --> 06:52.955
it would have been confronted right there
by multiple people, myself included,

06:53.038 --> 06:57.000
especially considering Eddie Gallagher
was not well-liked by anyone.

06:58.210 --> 07:00.462
Gio pretty much laid it all out for me.

07:00.546 --> 07:04.925
He just said that he was hanging out
with the accusers.

07:06.009 --> 07:09.847
And was like, they were coming up
with a story to come after me.

07:11.598 --> 07:15.727
I was relieved that somebody else
saw what was going on,

07:15.811 --> 07:20.440
saw the little mutiny that was formed
and how out of control it had gotten.

07:21.942 --> 07:25.195
A lot of these guys
started this deployment worshipping Eddie.

07:25.279 --> 07:28.156
And I think that
when the realities of combat and the--

07:28.240 --> 07:30.242
No more coddling and training.

07:30.742 --> 07:34.121
I think when some of that fell away,
a lot of those guys were disappointed.

07:34.872 --> 07:37.541
This guy pushed them to the limit.

07:38.041 --> 07:41.128
Eddie: Once we're set, have them
pull up to their positions again.

07:41.211 --> 07:43.463
See if we can see who's fucking shooting.

07:43.547 --> 07:45.966
-Then get at 'em.
-Yeah.

07:46.842 --> 07:52.514
So Eddie's now
the easiest brunt for everyone's anger.

07:52.598 --> 07:54.725
You know, maybe he just didn't give them
enough love.

07:55.726 --> 08:00.105
Dille: The most asinine patrol
I have ever done.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.108
Fucking stupid.

08:04.193 --> 08:06.570
Some of these men were my brothers,

08:07.196 --> 08:09.406
to the point they're my best friends
and I loved them.

08:10.115 --> 08:12.534
And now, I have to say,
"You know what, man?

08:12.618 --> 08:16.705
Like, no, that didn't happen,
and you're making it up.

08:18.081 --> 08:22.419
And I fucking hate Eddie,
but what you're doing is lying."

08:23.879 --> 08:26.340
Gio was really informative for me.

08:26.423 --> 08:28.634
I'd spent a couple of hours
on the phone with him.

08:28.717 --> 08:30.344
And it was so relieving
to talk to somebody

08:30.427 --> 08:31.512
who was in that platoon.

08:32.554 --> 08:35.474
He was like, "I don't know why everyone
keeps forgetting that I was right there,

08:35.557 --> 08:38.558
but I'm gonna testify
that Eddie did not do this."

08:44.274 --> 08:47.569
I always knew that, yes,
the government owned my husband.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.988
But I was always like,

08:50.072 --> 08:53.325
I'm not a Navy SEAL.
I'm not owned by the government.

08:54.034 --> 08:57.287
And I was not gonna sit back
and just let them railroad us.

08:58.038 --> 09:02.376
And now, I had to fight for my husband
because he could not fight for himself.

09:03.794 --> 09:06.755
And I would literally just pour myself,
like, a massive glass of bourbon

09:06.839 --> 09:08.924
and say, "Okay, what can I do?"

09:10.133 --> 09:11.677
I had been in politics before.

09:12.469 --> 09:17.432
For the first four or five weeks, I went
to The Hill virtually every other day,

09:17.516 --> 09:21.019
and the ask was always,
just let him out of the brig

09:21.103 --> 09:24.565
so that he can properly prepare
and meet with his attorneys.

09:25.482 --> 09:26.817
I went to the Democrats

09:26.900 --> 09:29.945
because I've worked for
five democratic members of Congress.

09:30.028 --> 09:32.531
I was like,
I am not asking for favoritism.

09:33.198 --> 09:34.908
I'm just asking for fairness.

09:34.992 --> 09:36.994
But there was always
this prevailing sentiment that,

09:37.077 --> 09:40.163
"Hey, buddy. You're fucked."
Like, "Sorry."

09:41.790 --> 09:43.292
While my brother-in-law, Sean,

09:43.375 --> 09:46.086
was standing on Capitol Hill
each and every day,

09:46.170 --> 09:50.299
I realized that I had to help my husband
in the only way I knew how.

09:50.382 --> 09:53.135
Hi, everybody. I'm Andrea Gallagher.

09:53.218 --> 09:54.970
I am the founder
of The Better Business Babe.

09:55.053 --> 09:58.432
The Better Business Babe supports women
through consulting, coaching,

09:58.515 --> 10:00.642
and then
full-scale brand evolution process.

10:00.726 --> 10:03.896
And we're gonna be sharing with you
an introduction workshop on branding.

10:03.979 --> 10:07.482
I knew that I could apply my background
in consulting and branding.

10:09.443 --> 10:12.487
I built a brand. It was called Free Eddie.

10:13.989 --> 10:17.492
Hi everyone. My name is Andrea Gallagher.
I'm Eddie's wife.

10:18.243 --> 10:21.121
I am kind of reaching out to you
for your help.

10:21.205 --> 10:24.124
And so the Free Eddie campaign became,
like, a thing.

10:24.208 --> 10:28.128
Hi, many of you have heard about
the ongoing struggle of our family

10:28.212 --> 10:31.131
due to the treatment
that the Navy has been inflicting

10:31.215 --> 10:32.799
on my husband, Eddie Gallagher.

10:32.883 --> 10:35.844
I mean, I had never done media.
I had never been on TV.

10:35.928 --> 10:39.765
But I felt like
it was part of what was necessary

10:39.848 --> 10:41.350
to give a voice to what was going on.

10:41.433 --> 10:43.977
We're lucky enough
to have found Mrs. Gallagher.

10:44.061 --> 10:46.146
She joins us now on The Savage Nation.

10:46.230 --> 10:48.482
And tell us, what are the allegations
against your husband?

10:48.565 --> 10:51.443
So,
my husband is facing life without parole.

10:51.527 --> 10:54.780
What?
So, they got low-life lawyers in the Navy

10:54.863 --> 10:57.324
who have nothing better to do
than persecute our warriors.

10:57.407 --> 10:58.617
This is crazy.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.702
It started really small.

11:00.786 --> 11:02.829
I said yes to everything.

11:02.913 --> 11:06.166
And I had no fucking clue
what I was getting myself into,

11:06.250 --> 11:08.293
but it was a wacky world,

11:08.377 --> 11:10.838
and it started with
super conservative radio.

11:10.921 --> 11:14.633
I cannot believe
that they are putting a hero,

11:14.716 --> 11:18.679
a 19-year veteran, in cuffs.

11:18.762 --> 11:20.681
This is outrageous.

11:20.764 --> 11:22.307
These guys are even madder than I am.

11:22.391 --> 11:24.768
They'd turn to me, and I was like,
"Yeah, this is a clear injustice."

11:24.852 --> 11:26.353
And they would take it and run with it.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.772
It's always good to hear
the same sentiment

11:28.856 --> 11:33.277
shared by folks who can see, kind of,
the absurdity of the situation.

11:33.360 --> 11:38.615
Oh, my God. Let me tell ya,
this is freakin' unbelievable.

11:38.699 --> 11:41.118
That's when the kind of,
like, the perception shift,

11:41.201 --> 11:42.786
in my mind, started to happen.

11:42.870 --> 11:46.164
We were seen then,
at that demarcation point,

11:46.248 --> 11:47.374
as a conservative cause.

11:47.457 --> 11:49.209
I will not stay quiet.
They can lo--

11:49.293 --> 11:51.795
Good for you.
And I won't stay quiet either.

11:51.879 --> 11:55.048
You're not gonna believe what kind of
money and help you're gonna get

11:55.132 --> 11:57.843
from the outraged Americans
who do support our warriors

11:57.926 --> 12:00.888
and are sick and tired
of these kind of persecutions.

12:01.597 --> 12:02.723
Thank you.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.821
When I first read about
Eddie's case, they didn't have a strategy.

12:19.198 --> 12:23.160
Andrea had been consulting
with my former client Bernie Kerik.

12:23.243 --> 12:26.747
He was a former police commissioner
of the city of New York,

12:26.830 --> 12:28.999
and he called me up, and he said,

12:29.082 --> 12:32.211
you know, Andrea and Eddie,
you know, they wanted to talk to me.

12:32.711 --> 12:36.924
Then I spoke with them on the phone,
and they made a decision.

12:37.633 --> 12:40.928
They trusted me
to be able to handle this case which,

12:41.011 --> 12:42.387
when you're fighting for your life,

12:42.471 --> 12:44.556
you need to be with somebody
that you can trust.

12:45.140 --> 12:48.268
Tim Parlatore came
and visited me in the brig.

12:48.352 --> 12:50.938
Definitely not what I was expecting
at all.

12:51.021 --> 12:53.607
What impressed me about Tim is
he was prior service.

12:53.690 --> 12:55.025
He was a Navy officer,

12:55.108 --> 12:58.987
and after talking to him,
I felt comfortable.

13:00.781 --> 13:04.451
When I met with Eddie,
one of the questions I asked him was,

13:04.535 --> 13:08.413
"What do you think is the single most
damaging piece of evidence against you?

13:08.497 --> 13:11.083
What is the biggest hill
that I need to climb over?"

13:11.875 --> 13:14.920
He looked at me, and he said,
"It's the text messages."

13:17.381 --> 13:20.175
"Funny story along with this one.
Got him with my hunting knife."

13:21.552 --> 13:24.221
Sure looks like a confession.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.306
But if you zoom in on that photo,

13:27.140 --> 13:30.310
you're gonna see
that the knife is completely clean.

13:30.394 --> 13:31.770
There's no blood on it.

13:31.854 --> 13:35.315
And this is not the arm
and knife of somebody who stabbed them.

13:38.360 --> 13:42.030
The case was essentially
a cold murder case. There was no body.

13:42.531 --> 13:45.325
There was only eyewitness accounts.

13:45.409 --> 13:47.327
So, the evidence was going to
really come down to

13:47.411 --> 13:51.039
witness testimony and photographs
and video at the scene.

13:52.916 --> 13:57.004
One of the big things
that we saw with these younger SEALs

13:57.087 --> 14:01.216
was that they were afraid of the mission
that they had been given.

14:01.300 --> 14:03.969
And so,
rather than power through the mission,

14:04.052 --> 14:05.971
or find a way to appropriately respond,

14:06.054 --> 14:07.639
they instead blamed Eddie.

14:08.849 --> 14:11.894
The generational gap between,

14:11.977 --> 14:15.564
you know, the old-school warriors
of Eddie Gallagher's generation

14:15.647 --> 14:19.193
and the younger kids in this platoon
was a decade.

14:21.028 --> 14:23.030
He was on his eighth deployment,

14:23.113 --> 14:27.534
and everybody else in the platoon
was on their max third deployment.

14:29.786 --> 14:31.788
For the vast majority of them,

14:31.872 --> 14:34.791
the first time
that they had ever actually been shot at

14:34.875 --> 14:36.877
was when they showed up in Mosul.

14:38.462 --> 14:44.384
You have one guy
that is a 9/11 conflict era guy,

14:44.468 --> 14:45.969
and then you had the generation

14:46.053 --> 14:49.723
that doesn't really grow up
with it hanging over their head.

14:50.307 --> 14:53.268
It's been euphemized as millennials.

14:53.852 --> 14:59.274
The egos almost made it seem like
we were on a Real World episode.

15:00.776 --> 15:03.779
As a Marine who's been in combat
and other theaters of war,

15:03.862 --> 15:08.033
I really believe that there was
a run of cowardice in that platoon.

15:09.493 --> 15:15.374
If you get branded as a coward by somebody
that's very well-respected, that's it.

15:15.457 --> 15:18.085
Reputation is everything with us.

15:19.169 --> 15:21.755
Andrea: A lot of these
more millennial mindset SEALs,

15:21.839 --> 15:25.676
they're used to just playing video games
and just hanging out.

15:25.759 --> 15:29.304
They didn't want to go out to battle.
They didn't want to be put in danger.

15:29.388 --> 15:31.890
They didn't sign up to do the work.

15:31.974 --> 15:34.977
They signed up to get the accolades,
to wear the Trident.

15:35.060 --> 15:36.979
And he called them out for cowardice.

15:37.062 --> 15:41.608
My brother had an incident with them
where he called them cowards in combat,

15:41.692 --> 15:43.443
and in the Navy SEALs,
that's a career killer.

15:43.527 --> 15:45.153
Calling a Navy SEAL a pussy or a coward

15:45.237 --> 15:47.239
is probably the worst thing
you can call them

15:47.322 --> 15:50.075
if you're a Navy SEAL
calling another Navy SEAL that.

15:50.158 --> 15:53.787
But if a government lobbyist
that's never served a day overseas

15:53.871 --> 15:56.790
calls me a pussy or a coward
like Sean Gallagher did,

15:56.874 --> 15:58.292
I mean, that's just really silly.

15:58.375 --> 16:03.380
This was all a slanderous smear campaign
by millennial SEALs that set him up

16:03.463 --> 16:06.049
because they knew they were gonna
have to be back under him again,

16:06.133 --> 16:07.134
and there's three…

16:07.217 --> 16:10.012
This narrative that
we were a bunch of entitled millennials

16:10.095 --> 16:12.055
that had never seen combat,

16:12.139 --> 16:15.309
that we didn't want to operate
the way things were supposed to go.

16:15.392 --> 16:17.269
It's, like, no, Eddie.

16:17.352 --> 16:20.230
We wanted to go kill ISIS
just as bad as you did.

16:20.314 --> 16:23.734
We just wanted to do everything we could
to make sure everyone came home.

16:24.860 --> 16:28.614
It was to be expected
that Andrea and Eddie's brother

16:28.697 --> 16:31.491
would try and paint us
in a negative light.

16:31.575 --> 16:35.746
But the more surprising thing
was when networks like Fox News

16:35.829 --> 16:38.832
that pride themselves
on being supporting of the military

16:39.499 --> 16:44.630
are sitting here
calling SEALs cowards and liars.

16:44.713 --> 16:47.716
On the one hand, you've got the claim
that people lack the courage

16:47.799 --> 16:50.969
to do what was necessary
in the heat of battle.

16:51.053 --> 16:53.263
On the other hand, it was
that they were involved in this plot

16:53.347 --> 16:55.474
to fabricate lies against Eddie.

16:55.557 --> 16:58.143
And neither one of those
could be further from the truth.

16:58.977 --> 17:03.440
You know, the fact that those stories
got so much traction on that basis

17:03.524 --> 17:04.942
was very shocking and surprising.

17:18.204 --> 17:23.502
We have thousands and thousands
of text thread pages with them on,

17:23.585 --> 17:27.714
Signal or WhatsApp
where they started a group.

17:27.798 --> 17:32.261
And the group specifically was formulated
to target Eddie.

17:55.075 --> 17:57.870
And what's interesting about this
is that if you look through

17:57.953 --> 18:01.456
every single thing on that group
and all that's being said,

18:01.540 --> 18:04.084
not once did they mention an ISIS fighter.

18:04.168 --> 18:07.045
Not once did they mention
Eddie killing someone.

18:07.129 --> 18:08.922
It's all these petty complaints.

18:10.132 --> 18:11.216
Breisch: They brought up

18:11.300 --> 18:12.718
the petty things, like,

18:12.801 --> 18:16.972
he stole stuff out of the care packages.
He stole my sunglasses.

18:17.055 --> 18:20.309
And I just said, "Well, just…

18:21.518 --> 18:23.187
decompress. Take some time.

18:23.270 --> 18:25.606
Either there's a criminal act
or there isn't.

18:25.689 --> 18:27.357
And if there isn't,
you need to let it go."

18:35.324 --> 18:39.036
Every single one of their complaints
kept getting shot down by the command.

18:39.119 --> 18:40.996
And since they weren't getting
what they wanted,

18:41.079 --> 18:42.581
they just kept escalating.

18:43.081 --> 18:45.083
What you're telling me is
that he put you guys in danger.

18:45.167 --> 18:47.294
He stole some fucking PowerBars.

18:47.377 --> 18:50.547
So I need more, like,
what is it that's bothering you guys?

18:50.631 --> 18:52.090
And that's when

18:52.174 --> 18:54.259
they brought up
the fact that there was

18:54.343 --> 18:57.763
some rules of armed conflict,
armed conflict broken.

18:57.846 --> 19:00.516
Thereafter, for the very first time,

19:01.183 --> 19:05.020
roughly probably seven and a half months
after they came home,

19:05.103 --> 19:12.027
was the first time ever that
these guys uttered the words "war crimes."

19:12.110 --> 19:13.153
He committed a war crime.

19:24.081 --> 19:28.168
That text thread wasn't designed
to report war crimes.

19:28.252 --> 19:34.299
That text message thread was
a group of dudes who were BS-ing.

19:34.383 --> 19:36.552
And where the real reporting happened

19:36.635 --> 19:40.639
was in an investigation room
with an NCIS agent.

19:41.265 --> 19:45.561
Warpinski: Earlier you mentioned
the person was stabbed in the neck.

19:45.644 --> 19:47.354
You guys had that meeting that night

19:47.437 --> 19:50.440
and you said somebody brought up
the term "war crimes."

19:50.524 --> 19:51.525
Right?

19:52.025 --> 19:54.361
Is there any doubt in your mind
that these are war crimes?

19:54.444 --> 19:55.904
Dille: No.

19:57.447 --> 19:59.867
The leadership, they were like,
"Yeah, you can come, you know--

19:59.950 --> 20:02.828
I have an open door policy.
You can come and bring anything."

20:02.911 --> 20:07.958
But then when war crimes
allegations land on their desk,

20:08.041 --> 20:09.918
all of a sudden everyone wants
to plug their ears

20:10.002 --> 20:11.295
and act like they didn't hear it.

20:11.378 --> 20:13.005
Warpinski: Any idea of around when this

20:13.088 --> 20:14.173
conversation might have happened?

20:14.256 --> 20:17.009
Christmas, Christmas time frame.

20:17.092 --> 20:19.678
NCIS Investigator:
So the 6th of April was the first time

20:19.761 --> 20:22.389
any allegations were brought
to your attention regarding

20:22.472 --> 20:25.392
Gallagher allegedly stabbing the prisoner.

20:25.475 --> 20:26.476
Breisch: Correct.

20:27.436 --> 20:31.899
As soon as the accusations
reached the level of NCIS investigation,

20:31.982 --> 20:34.735
everyone was covering their tail
from the top down

20:34.818 --> 20:37.946
because there were tons of people
who heard these allegations

20:38.822 --> 20:40.908
within a week of us getting home

20:40.991 --> 20:43.160
and didn't report it
through official channels.

20:43.243 --> 20:45.287
There was no evolution of…

20:46.330 --> 20:48.957
this started with cookie butter
and ended in war crimes.

20:49.041 --> 20:51.793
It stemmed from war crimes.

20:51.877 --> 20:55.297
It started at war crimes,
and it was war crimes the entire way.

21:06.141 --> 21:09.353
It's common knowledge
within the Navy that

21:09.436 --> 21:12.606
Naval Special Warfare is
a very tight-knit group,

21:12.689 --> 21:17.945
and that creates challenges
for anyone investigating a case like this.

21:18.904 --> 21:24.117
I am not aware of another case where,

21:24.201 --> 21:28.539
so many members of a SEAL platoon
came forward,

21:28.622 --> 21:29.998
to cooperate with the government.

21:31.166 --> 21:34.169
I've covered the military as a journalist,

21:34.253 --> 21:38.757
but also I've been a part of
the military and veteran community

21:38.841 --> 21:40.634
for a very long time.

21:41.718 --> 21:43.554
This never happens.

21:43.637 --> 21:49.393
A group of Navy SEALs, a tight-knit
elite platoon of Special Operators,

21:50.477 --> 21:54.523
doesn't just turn on their chief
and turn them in for war crimes.

21:55.816 --> 21:57.401
It just doesn't happen.

21:57.484 --> 21:58.861
When the case started,

21:58.944 --> 22:02.239
I was a national correspondent
for The New York Times,

22:02.322 --> 22:05.492
and my job was to cover
the military and veterans.

22:05.576 --> 22:06.869
The head of the Navy SEALs

22:06.952 --> 22:11.206
is reviewing allegations of war crimes
and drug abuse within the elite force.

22:11.290 --> 22:14.084
For more than a year
before Gallagher's case hit the media,

22:14.168 --> 22:19.131
there were, all sorts
of high-profile incidences.

22:19.214 --> 22:23.677
How prevalent is drug abuse
in the SEAL teams?

22:23.760 --> 22:26.138
People that we know of,
that we hear about,

22:26.221 --> 22:31.560
have tested positive for cocaine,
methamphetamine, heroin. That's a problem.

22:32.144 --> 22:36.899
A lot of stuff was causing
real concern to the SEAL brass.

22:37.399 --> 22:41.236
NCIS and the prosecution team
had articulated out loud

22:41.320 --> 22:43.822
that it would have been good
to "score a win."

22:43.906 --> 22:49.119
Use Ed's case as a way of proving that
America is above this.

22:49.203 --> 22:53.665
This is an example of bad,
and us prosecuting it is us being good.

22:54.833 --> 22:57.503
So, we said, "Fuck it.
We're gonna fight this narrative."

22:57.586 --> 23:01.965
Ed's a good and decent man,
a loving father, a dedicated husband.

23:02.049 --> 23:03.383
He's a tremendous soldier.

23:03.467 --> 23:05.010
Andrea and Sean Gallagher,

23:05.093 --> 23:07.596
they were just driving this narrative,
all this publicity,

23:07.679 --> 23:10.140
"he's a victim," and all this crap.

23:10.224 --> 23:12.309
And, the problem was

23:12.392 --> 23:15.896
when it started drumming up all this,
negative attention

23:15.979 --> 23:18.106
from the rest of the community
focused on us.

23:23.904 --> 23:28.575
We had United States Navy SEALs
going on social media and saying that

23:28.659 --> 23:33.455
they were gonna come after
our families and our kids and our parents.

23:35.457 --> 23:37.417
Once the investigation was launched,

23:37.501 --> 23:39.461
it just spread through the teams
like wildfire.

23:39.962 --> 23:44.341
Immediately, members in the community
were seeking out where we lived,

23:44.424 --> 23:48.011
floating what I call,
soft death threats.

23:48.095 --> 23:50.138
And it became apparent that

23:50.222 --> 23:55.394
once you turn in a pirate,
you're kicked off the pirate ship.

23:55.477 --> 23:57.896
A fundraiser is being held in Escondido

23:57.980 --> 23:59.982
to support
Navy SEAL chief Eddie Gallagher.

24:00.065 --> 24:02.067
Joining us this morning
to talk about the fundraiser

24:02.150 --> 24:04.361
is Eddie Gallagher's wife,
Andrea Gallagher.

24:04.444 --> 24:06.864
-Andrea, great to see you again.
-Good to see you. Thanks, Jason.

24:06.947 --> 24:08.615
Okay, lots of people supporting Eddie.

24:08.699 --> 24:10.492
There is. We're so thankful for that.

24:10.576 --> 24:13.412
So this fundraiser tomorrow
is in Escondido.

24:13.495 --> 24:15.455
It's from noon to about eight o'clock.

24:15.539 --> 24:18.125
We'll have barbecue, a silent auction…

24:18.208 --> 24:21.461
Andrea was marching everybody
to the beat of the same drum.

24:21.545 --> 24:23.755
Eddie first, everything else second.

24:24.381 --> 24:26.925
What are we doing to impact the situation?

24:27.009 --> 24:32.764
For $50, you can actually have
a hand-rolled cigar, two drink tickets.

24:32.848 --> 24:35.392
It will also be a time to interact

24:35.475 --> 24:38.103
and find out the truth
about what's going on.

24:39.521 --> 24:41.398
A lot of our coordination was fundraising.

24:41.481 --> 24:46.069
We knew that getting enough money
for the legal team was the top priority.

24:48.322 --> 24:53.702
The expenses just to defend Eddie
at a baseline were half a million dollars.

24:54.411 --> 24:56.955
Sean and I,
through this grassroots campaign

24:57.039 --> 25:01.001
raised over $750,000
for the defense of Eddie.

25:01.502 --> 25:06.882
We started to really tip the scales
of getting more people

25:06.965 --> 25:10.969
that were invested and involved in
trying to fight and advocate for Eddie.

25:11.053 --> 25:16.016
They will never do this to another
military service member ever again

25:16.099 --> 25:18.268
because they'll know that
we'll come for them.

25:18.769 --> 25:21.396
Long live the real brotherhood
and free Eddie!

25:26.443 --> 25:33.242
Andrea Gallagher led one of the most
successful social media campaigns

25:33.325 --> 25:34.326
I have ever seen.

25:34.409 --> 25:36.495
We want to see justice be served,

25:36.578 --> 25:40.123
and we want to see Eddie go free
to be able to defend himself properly.

25:40.207 --> 25:42.125
She was in the hundreds of thousands

25:42.209 --> 25:45.754
of people seeing her posts,
watching her videos,

25:46.255 --> 25:49.842
and the government didn't have
that ability.

25:49.925 --> 25:52.386
If we are complicit to injustice,

25:52.469 --> 25:55.806
it is a travesty to this nation,
and we should not stand for it. So I…

25:55.889 --> 25:59.601
Leading up to the trial, the judge imposed
a gag order on all witnesses

25:59.685 --> 26:02.729
that forbid you from talking to any media.

26:03.397 --> 26:07.693
So, essentially, one side is allowed
to put out information,

26:07.776 --> 26:10.112
slanted to their benefit.

26:10.195 --> 26:13.156
Yet, people
on the other side are barred

26:13.240 --> 26:17.786
from even defending themselves
against even personal attacks.

26:18.787 --> 26:21.331
When it comes to this case
being played out

26:21.415 --> 26:23.417
in the social media forum,
in the public forum,

26:23.500 --> 26:28.338
Navy, our policy is we do not speak
about ongoing investigations or cases.

26:28.422 --> 26:29.756
That is our procedure.

26:29.840 --> 26:33.886
So, it was like fighting Mike Tyson
with both arms tied behind your back.

26:33.969 --> 26:36.430
We couldn't refute anything.

26:36.513 --> 26:38.849
So, it was unfortunate that
a few of the underlings,

26:38.932 --> 26:42.644
disgruntled because they were criticized
for not being combat-ready,

26:42.728 --> 26:43.896
fabricated stories…

26:43.979 --> 26:45.898
There was a sense that
we were building momentum.

26:45.981 --> 26:50.652
But that is not enough
to build the case publicly.

26:50.736 --> 26:52.946
And so my whole thing was,
what can we do?

26:53.030 --> 26:56.325
Eddie is in jail.
We need to get him out.

26:56.408 --> 26:59.661
He's got two fighters on the outside
making sure he gets out soon…

26:59.745 --> 27:01.538
-Absolutely.
-…and hopefully one in the White House.

27:01.622 --> 27:04.082
-Thanks, Brian.
-We really appreciate it. Thank you.

27:04.166 --> 27:05.542
We had been told, repeatedly, that

27:05.626 --> 27:08.504
if you get on Fox,
particularly Fox and Friends,

27:08.587 --> 27:11.548
you know, the President,
as everybody knows, might be watching,

27:11.632 --> 27:13.133
and you can reach him that way.

27:13.217 --> 27:16.053
So, strategically that was
what we were always trying to do.

27:17.221 --> 27:20.140
Sean Gallagher joins us now
to go to bat for his brother.

27:20.224 --> 27:24.520
Sean, it's the battlefield.
Isn't the goal to kill ISIS?

27:25.812 --> 27:28.524
Precisely. That is precisely
what we've been saying.

27:28.607 --> 27:31.151
And this entire system is broken.

27:31.235 --> 27:33.820
That's why we're calling on the president
of the United States to fix it.

27:33.904 --> 27:35.822
I was on at 7:30 a.m. or 7:00 a.m.

27:35.906 --> 27:38.617
and I think at like 9:00,
I open up Twitter,

27:38.700 --> 27:41.203
and I'm like, "Oh, my gosh.
There's Donald Trump's tweet."

27:44.665 --> 27:47.459
The fact that I was able
to reach the leader of the free world

27:47.543 --> 27:50.754
by going on a morning news show
seems fucking crazy,

27:50.838 --> 27:54.174
but it allowed a nobody to speak

27:54.258 --> 27:56.802
to the most powerful person ever
and to get a reaction.

27:58.762 --> 28:01.765
I was out in Monterey, California,
at the Naval postgrad school

28:01.849 --> 28:04.560
at 4:00 a.m. in the morning,
and you get the phone call that,

28:04.643 --> 28:08.814
you kind of hope you never get,
which was, "Hold for the White House."

28:08.897 --> 28:11.191
And, President got on the line.

28:11.275 --> 28:13.902
I was expecting his chief of staff,
but the President got on the line

28:13.986 --> 28:16.613
and said, "This Gallagher case,"

28:17.614 --> 28:19.366
"You can't have him
in solitary confinement."

28:19.449 --> 28:23.579
So, I said, "Mr. President, you understand
that he's not in solitary confinement."

28:23.662 --> 28:25.664
Which the president
didn't really wanna hear.

28:25.747 --> 28:28.625
"Richard, get him out."
And that was the end of the phone call.

28:29.835 --> 28:31.670
I was marching to lunch that day.

28:31.753 --> 28:34.506
One of the guards, a female guard,
was looking at me.

28:34.590 --> 28:38.927
And, I sort of glanced over,
and she was like, "Are you leaving today?"

28:39.678 --> 28:41.305
And I was like, "I don't know, am I?"

28:41.388 --> 28:43.974
And she was like, "Well,
the president just tweeted about you,

28:44.057 --> 28:45.267
and it's on the news."

28:46.143 --> 28:48.770
President Trump
has stepped in for Gallagher,

28:48.854 --> 28:52.191
directing the Navy to move him
from the brig to the barracks.

28:53.442 --> 28:57.237
Up until that point,
I was supportive of the president,

28:57.321 --> 28:59.615
and, I voted for him.

28:59.698 --> 29:03.118
But when I saw that
he supported Eddie Gallagher,

29:03.202 --> 29:05.913
I was extremely, extremely disappointed.

29:05.996 --> 29:12.794
At that point, it was really, like, "Wow.
We are the underdogs here."

29:12.878 --> 29:16.173
When Trump tweeted Eddie's name
for the first time,

29:16.256 --> 29:21.845
It was just a total rocking of my world

29:21.929 --> 29:25.807
that the most powerful man
in the world just tweeted the name

29:25.891 --> 29:30.354
of a psychopathic war criminal
in a positive light.

29:30.437 --> 29:32.689
The president has said
this is unconstitutional.

29:32.773 --> 29:34.525
He needs to have a right
to defend himself.

29:34.608 --> 29:38.487
This is finally happening.
So it was a huge high for our family.

29:39.154 --> 29:42.074
The goal was get him out
so he can properly prepare.

29:42.157 --> 29:44.660
Just get my brother out of prison.
That was it.

29:44.743 --> 29:47.996
But, we would learn that
it wouldn't exactly work out that way.

29:51.959 --> 29:53.460
We started working on

29:53.544 --> 29:56.255
seeing if we could move Chief Gallagher
to some other position

29:56.338 --> 29:58.674
but yet keep him
in some sort of confinement,

29:58.757 --> 30:01.301
so we knew where he was,
and he wasn't threatening witnesses.

30:05.556 --> 30:09.643
The president had got involved
and tweeted and released me,

30:09.726 --> 30:12.020
so I was out of the brig.

30:12.104 --> 30:18.694
But only to be thrown…
or put into a barracks room

30:18.777 --> 30:23.198
with a crazy list of restrictions to where
I might as well still been in a cell.

30:24.032 --> 30:25.492
I'm innocent. I love you.

30:26.660 --> 30:29.955
-I love you. Bye, sweetheart.
-Yeah. All right.

30:30.455 --> 30:31.623
All right. I'll see you, babe.

30:31.707 --> 30:33.250
-Free Eddie.
-See you guys.

30:34.293 --> 30:36.211
We're just still crying out here.

30:36.295 --> 30:39.882
President tweeted and intervened
and told the secretary of the Navy

30:39.965 --> 30:43.051
on the 30th of March, and,
it's the end of April, everybody.

30:43.135 --> 30:45.804
So, we're still dealing
with this crap.

30:45.888 --> 30:48.182
We appreciate your support
and just want you to know that

30:48.265 --> 30:51.810
today marks the 30-day mark
until we get to this trial.

30:53.228 --> 30:54.897
I was pretty nervous

30:54.980 --> 30:57.816
because I still wasn't able
to communicate with my lawyers.

30:57.900 --> 30:59.109
Tim did what he could.

30:59.943 --> 31:02.237
I had no idea who Marc Mukasey was
at the time.

31:02.821 --> 31:06.074
Tim said, "Hey, he's one
of the president's lawyers,"

31:06.158 --> 31:09.578
I was like, "That means he's good,"
you know. He knows his shit.

31:10.787 --> 31:15.751
In April of 2019, I get hooked up
with the defense team.

31:16.335 --> 31:19.254
This was the ultimate trial.

31:19.338 --> 31:24.134
I didn't give a goddamn
about who supported him and who didn't.

31:24.218 --> 31:25.385
I wanted to try the case.

31:27.429 --> 31:31.141
I'm meeting with Tim.
I'm reading about the case.

31:31.225 --> 31:32.809
I'm learning the case.

31:32.893 --> 31:38.732
And just to be courteous, I sent an email
to the lead prosecutor at the time

31:38.815 --> 31:43.153
and I said, "My name's Marc Mukasey.
I'm joining the defense team.

31:43.237 --> 31:45.197
Look forward to working with you."

31:45.280 --> 31:48.784
Three seconds later
I got back an email that said,

31:48.867 --> 31:52.371
"Marc, nice to meet you.
Look forward to working with you too."

31:52.454 --> 31:56.708
It turns out, the email that he sent to me
had a tracking device on it.

31:59.378 --> 32:04.800
In the days before the trial,
there were a number of leaks,

32:04.883 --> 32:08.220
most of which went to the Navy Times.

32:08.303 --> 32:12.307
And the Navy was clearly upset
by the leaks that were happening.

32:12.391 --> 32:18.605
NCIS wanted to see if they could
discover who was leaking these materials.

32:18.689 --> 32:24.903
All they asked me to do was allow them
to put the code in my email and send it.

32:26.321 --> 32:30.284
They put into the bottom
of the email signature block

32:30.367 --> 32:35.664
of Commander Chris Czaplak
the logo of the office where he worked,

32:35.747 --> 32:40.836
but embedded in the image
was some sort of beacon.

32:41.795 --> 32:45.757
That technology would tell the Navy

32:45.841 --> 32:51.388
whether this email was being forwarded on
to other people that shouldn't have it.

32:52.472 --> 32:56.059
This was not
an invasion of data.

32:56.143 --> 33:00.522
This was just a locating device
that NCIS uses in military situations

33:00.606 --> 33:03.233
to catch people trying
to exfiltrate information.

33:04.151 --> 33:07.154
We were just looking for the IP address
of where these emails were going

33:07.237 --> 33:08.614
to find out where there was a leak.

33:10.908 --> 33:12.826
If there's two groups of people that

33:12.910 --> 33:18.040
you shouldn't be trying to spy on
without a warrant,

33:18.540 --> 33:24.087
it's attorneys and members of the media
'cause they're going to be rightly upset.

33:24.671 --> 33:26.131
And that's exactly what happened.

33:27.466 --> 33:31.053
They used intelligence assets
to target defense attorneys.

33:31.136 --> 33:34.848
I expect that there should be
congressional investigations on this.

33:34.932 --> 33:36.558
I think that there should be indictments.

33:36.642 --> 33:40.020
I think that certain NCIS agents
should be taken out in cuffs.

33:41.480 --> 33:46.151
But if it had happened in
a federal criminal court, civilian court,

33:47.611 --> 33:49.947
I think the prosecutors
would have gone to jail.

33:50.030 --> 33:54.243
And now we find out,
that there's malware that shows that

33:54.326 --> 33:57.788
the prosecution was spying on you.

33:57.871 --> 34:00.666
We're less than two weeks away
from the jury trial,

34:00.749 --> 34:02.793
and this type of prosecutorial misconduct,

34:02.876 --> 34:06.463
the entire prosecutorial team
should be taken off the case.

34:06.547 --> 34:08.590
We need to know
what the judge knew and when.

34:08.674 --> 34:10.007
-Right.
-And, quite frankly,

34:10.092 --> 34:11.510
the whole thing should be dismissed.

34:11.592 --> 34:15.222
The fallout from the email step
happened almost immediately.

34:15.973 --> 34:19.643
Ultimately, the judge disqualified me
from further participation.

34:21.228 --> 34:27.525
In hindsight, the risk
was not worth it.

34:28.318 --> 34:31.612
The new prosecutor
had maybe two weeks

34:31.697 --> 34:35.617
to get up to speed on
thousands of pages of discovery

34:35.701 --> 34:41.164
and all the hours of witness testimony,
and then prepare to try the case.

34:42.708 --> 34:47.588
The most experienced prosecutor
in the Navy on the West Coast,

34:47.670 --> 34:51.049
the guy who has headed this case
since day one, is out.

34:51.717 --> 34:53.302
Right before trial, he's gone.

34:53.385 --> 34:56.554
And Eddie gets out of confinement.

34:56.638 --> 34:58.265
A military judge ordering

34:58.348 --> 35:01.310
the release of Eddie Gallagher
just days before his trial,

35:01.393 --> 35:04.730
saying prosecutors violated
his right to a fair trial

35:04.813 --> 35:08.734
when they tracked emails
between him and his defense team.

35:08.817 --> 35:10.611
I almost didn't believe it
when he said it.

35:10.694 --> 35:11.945
I was sort of like, "What?"

35:12.029 --> 35:15.032
And Andrea got up
and started screaming in the courtroom.

35:16.241 --> 35:17.409
Like crying screaming.

35:19.745 --> 35:23.081
Obviously we're thrilled at the action
that Judge Rugh took yesterday.

35:23.165 --> 35:27.669
I mean, having my husband
to be actually treated like

35:27.753 --> 35:31.298
a person that's innocent
until proven guilty is a good change.

35:31.381 --> 35:33.759
I still had life in prison
hanging over my head.

35:33.842 --> 35:35.427
You know, the black cloud was still there.

35:35.511 --> 35:39.556
So after I was released
from confinement,

35:39.640 --> 35:41.058
it was game on until the trial.

35:41.141 --> 35:43.393
Like, we were prepping for war.

35:44.770 --> 35:50.400
Things started to change because Eddie
had representation from Trump's lawyers.

35:50.901 --> 35:57.157
He had Trump's ears and eyes
with all their Fox News media campaign.

35:58.575 --> 36:01.036
And when people in the platoon
began to think that

36:01.119 --> 36:03.830
they were possibly
in legal trouble themselves,

36:04.331 --> 36:08.377
and they would be held liable if they knew
about something but didn't report it,

36:08.460 --> 36:11.380
it became a protect-yourself scenario.

36:11.463 --> 36:14.675
And, unfortunately,
the truth gets pushed to the wayside

36:14.758 --> 36:17.261
when people start trying
to protect themselves.

36:20.639 --> 36:22.224
Just before the trial,

36:22.307 --> 36:26.144
you had a whole platoon of United States
Navy SEALs ready to take the stand

36:26.228 --> 36:28.438
and say what Eddie had done.

36:28.522 --> 36:31.608
I mean, from our perspective,
everyone was on board,

36:31.692 --> 36:33.569
and then suddenly
these articles start coming out

36:33.652 --> 36:37.656
where there's some Navy SEALs in the
platoon that are defending his actions.

36:37.739 --> 36:38.740
What?

36:57.384 --> 37:03.307
The initial understanding that I had
was that the platoon was pretty unanimous

37:03.390 --> 37:08.729
about the things that they saw
should be brought forward.

37:09.980 --> 37:13.025
But that seemed to change
the closer we got to the trial.

37:13.108 --> 37:16.028
The trial of a Navy SEAL
accused of war crimes

37:16.111 --> 37:17.738
will get underway tomorrow.

37:17.821 --> 37:21.950
Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher
has pleaded not guilty to…

37:22.034 --> 37:24.077
Tim was gonna give
the opening statement.

37:24.161 --> 37:25.662
We practiced it in the hotel.

37:25.746 --> 37:29.541
And his first opening statement
was about the history of the Navy,

37:29.625 --> 37:33.420
and it was eloquent and poetic
and beautiful.

37:33.504 --> 37:39.009
I said, "Tim, we're talking about Eddie
Gallagher and a murder case here, right?

37:39.092 --> 37:41.929
You just made beautiful love
to that opening.

37:43.263 --> 37:46.600
Don't make love to the opening statement.
Fuck it."

37:46.683 --> 37:50.229
We weren't going to work in this case,
we were going to war.

37:59.530 --> 38:02.115
Going into the trial,
it was like, finally.

38:02.699 --> 38:04.576
Finally I get to get in the ring.

38:04.660 --> 38:06.328
On trial for war crimes,

38:06.411 --> 38:09.873
today, Special Operations Chief
Edward Gallagher stands charged

38:09.957 --> 38:14.503
with murdering a wounded ISIS fighter
and with shooting two unarmed civilians.

38:14.586 --> 38:16.672
You know, we'd been
working up to it for so long

38:16.755 --> 38:20.467
that I think I was just
in fight mode.

38:20.551 --> 38:23.220
Opening statements
are expected Tuesday afternoon

38:23.303 --> 38:26.181
in the murder trial of
Navy SEAL Chief Edward Gallagher.

38:26.265 --> 38:29.685
I was just tethered to my faith.
Like, this is gonna work out.

38:29.768 --> 38:34.565
Like, yes, this is bad.
Yes, this is horrible, but it'll be okay.

38:34.648 --> 38:37.484
Gallagher has pleaded
not guilty to all charges

38:37.568 --> 38:41.363
and, if convicted of murder,
he could face life in prison.

38:41.446 --> 38:43.282
Eddie's been slandering me
in the media

38:43.365 --> 38:45.158
for the past I don't know how many months.

38:45.242 --> 38:48.620
And now you're coming after me.
You own the media right now.

38:48.704 --> 38:51.081
I have a gag order. Yeah, but guess what?

38:51.164 --> 38:52.916
There's no gag order on the stand.

39:03.218 --> 39:05.637
I believe the Navy had
a pretty strong case

39:05.721 --> 39:07.347
with all the evidence that was there.

39:07.431 --> 39:08.891
We had the threatening texts,

39:08.974 --> 39:11.768
we had the photographs
and their testimonies.

39:11.852 --> 39:14.646
Those were pretty strong evidence.

39:15.230 --> 39:18.233
So, you have
three eyewitnesses to a stabbing,

39:18.317 --> 39:22.571
a photo of Eddie with the body,

39:22.654 --> 39:26.950
with what seemed to be wounds consistent
to what the witnesses were describing,

39:27.034 --> 39:31.330
and the accused person texts
a photo of himself

39:31.413 --> 39:34.625
with the murder weapon
and the victim to one of his friends,

39:34.708 --> 39:36.793
saying "Got him with my hunting knife."

39:36.877 --> 39:40.797
I mean, if you can't work with that,
what are you gonna do, right?

39:54.394 --> 39:55.979
Walking into the courtroom,

39:56.063 --> 40:00.359
that was the first time that I'd been
face-to-face with Eddie since all of this,

40:00.442 --> 40:03.654
and I made eye contact with him,

40:03.737 --> 40:05.239
and he mean-mugged me.

40:05.322 --> 40:06.782
He gave me a stare down.

40:06.865 --> 40:11.453
And it was clear
that there was some serious animosity.

40:23.590 --> 40:26.927
The jury was made up
primarily of marine combat veterans.

40:27.010 --> 40:28.762
They were senior enlisted leaders.

40:29.638 --> 40:31.807
They didn't know Eddie Gallagher,

40:31.890 --> 40:36.603
but the jurors could look over at him

40:36.687 --> 40:41.692
and understand what he had been through
just by looking at his ribbons and medals.

40:44.319 --> 40:48.156
I felt a great responsibility
to represent well

40:48.240 --> 40:52.536
and serve some sort of justice
for these victims.

40:52.619 --> 40:56.790
And that weight on my shoulders was heavy.

41:31.074 --> 41:35.204
Early on, the prosecution feels
like it's doing okay.

41:35.287 --> 41:37.873
It seems to be unfolding about as planned.

41:37.956 --> 41:41.585
But I don't think they were prepared for,

41:41.668 --> 41:47.674
the quality of cross-examination
that Tim Parlatore gave.

42:22.042 --> 42:26.004
There's just these tiny nuances
that he would try and pick out,

42:26.880 --> 42:29.716
and get you with this,
"Well, how do you know?

42:29.800 --> 42:31.385
Did you watch him pull the trigger?"

42:31.468 --> 42:33.762
While I'm looking through my scope,

42:33.846 --> 42:36.682
I can't be watching
Eddie pull the trigger.

42:38.934 --> 42:43.230
And in that exact moment, I'm like,
"Wow, he just--" You know, he got me.

42:45.274 --> 42:48.652
Dille seemed convincing.
He seemed, to me, very credible.

42:49.278 --> 42:53.615
He didn't stutter around.
He didn't have any lapses of memory.

42:54.491 --> 42:55.492
He spoke well.

42:55.576 --> 42:58.954
But once it got turned over
to the defense side,

42:59.037 --> 43:01.707
it was a completely different story.

44:03.060 --> 44:05.312
The only thing
that holds up is the truth,

44:05.395 --> 44:07.231
and that's what I was trying to say.

44:07.898 --> 44:10.025
And the truth is also not perfect.

44:10.526 --> 44:12.236
If I were to make up a story,

44:12.319 --> 44:15.280
there would be a lot more elements
that were certain.

44:15.364 --> 44:19.993
But I had seen Eddie target
so many unjust targets

44:20.077 --> 44:22.120
that I knew no one else
would've taken that shot.

44:29.795 --> 44:32.130
I'd never been
inside of a courtroom.

44:32.214 --> 44:34.132
And this was not my world.

44:34.216 --> 44:39.304
And to be in that courtroom
was a different experience.

44:39.388 --> 44:41.098
But guess what?
I'm gonna go up on the stand,

44:41.181 --> 44:43.684
I'm gonna tell them exactly what I saw,
and what happened.

45:10.169 --> 45:12.629
Every little minute detail
was getting picked apart.

45:12.713 --> 45:15.007
Yeah, it was extremely frustrating

45:15.090 --> 45:18.051
because every single witness
has a slightly different story

45:18.135 --> 45:19.553
from their vantage point.

45:19.636 --> 45:21.889
But Parlatore was doing his best
to try and pick apart my story.

45:21.972 --> 45:23.891
The thing about my story is,
it's the truth.

45:24.975 --> 45:29.771
It was at that point I'm just like,
"Wow, this is a complete show."

45:31.607 --> 45:35.819
It was really remarkable to see these
SEALs for the first time up on the stand.

45:35.903 --> 45:40.741
They just seemed like…
someone had gut punched them.

45:41.408 --> 45:46.371
Parlatore was able to suggest that maybe
things weren't what the SEALs were saying,

45:46.455 --> 45:49.291
or maybe what the SEALs were saying
you couldn't trust.

45:51.126 --> 45:55.797
But, for Parlatore,
there was still the problem of the photo.

45:57.132 --> 46:00.135
The charge related
to the death of the terrorist

46:00.219 --> 46:04.181
was the only one that carried
a mandatory minimum of life.

46:04.264 --> 46:07.309
So that was really the one thing that--

46:07.392 --> 46:10.479
Even if you win everything else,
if you lose the murder count,

46:11.104 --> 46:13.023
no matter what brilliant argument
I come up with,

46:13.106 --> 46:14.691
he's still going away for life.

46:15.192 --> 46:16.527
So that was--

46:16.610 --> 46:19.821
That was certainly the wolf that was
the closest to the henhouse for us.

46:21.657 --> 46:25.118
And what the prosecution was counting on
was two witnesses,

46:25.202 --> 46:27.955
Craig Miller and Corey Scott.

46:45.848 --> 46:49.810
Miller started off pretty well,
explaining what he saw,

46:49.893 --> 46:51.478
explaining what happened.

46:52.062 --> 46:56.859
And he was not emotional
as he was in the NCIS briefing.

46:56.942 --> 46:58.277
So it was very sober.

47:21.216 --> 47:25.053
But when he was
under cross-examination, he…

47:26.471 --> 47:28.765
There's no other way to put it.
He fell apart.

48:04.801 --> 48:07.846
The defense used
all these manipulation techniques

48:07.930 --> 48:10.641
that aren't aimed at finding the truth.

48:10.724 --> 48:13.018
They're aimed at one person's benefit.

48:13.101 --> 48:15.938
And the truth gets thrown out the window.

48:17.648 --> 48:24.029
Miller's testimony was
a real setback for the prosecution.

48:24.112 --> 48:29.117
Craig Miller was the SEAL
who was gonna really kick-start the case

48:29.201 --> 48:31.328
about the stabbing of the ISIS fighter,

48:32.371 --> 48:34.831
and he didn't do it.

48:34.915 --> 48:37.334
What did we learn
about Chief Miller today?

48:37.417 --> 48:40.379
What we learned about Chief Miller
is that when you're not telling the truth,

48:40.462 --> 48:43.507
you can't remember anything
to keep your story straight.

48:43.590 --> 48:46.927
After the first couple of days of trial,
we felt pretty confident

48:47.010 --> 48:51.014
because their evidence mostly consisted
of eyewitness testimony,

48:51.098 --> 48:55.602
and so far all of that eyewitness
testimony fell completely flat.

48:56.186 --> 48:58.313
So, at that point,

48:59.273 --> 49:01.024
while certainly nothing is guaranteed,

49:01.108 --> 49:03.777
it certainly felt like
we were well ahead.

49:03.861 --> 49:07.865
Every day in trial
was such a saga of like--

49:08.365 --> 49:14.663
It was more like My Cousin Vinny
half the time than it was like Tom Cruise.

49:14.746 --> 49:19.668
It was comical
how bad the prosecution was.

49:19.751 --> 49:24.923
It was comical how much the guys could not
keep up with their lies on the stand.

49:25.007 --> 49:28.969
This entire case was built
on just a small core group of people

49:29.052 --> 49:32.347
that had personal animosity
towards Eddie Gallagher.

49:32.431 --> 49:35.559
They told stories that just
couldn't hold up.

49:35.642 --> 49:41.565
They were like storybook,
about tactical, just assault on BS.

49:41.648 --> 49:44.026
And so by the time
they had given their testimony

49:44.109 --> 49:46.361
and by the time
that they had gotten to trial,

49:46.445 --> 49:48.739
they had told so many lies

49:48.822 --> 49:51.575
that I think it was pretty much impossible
to keep up with.

49:51.658 --> 49:54.870
So, that day when Corey Scott testified,

49:54.953 --> 49:57.206
we really didn't know
what he was going to say.

49:58.081 --> 49:59.416
Good morning.

50:04.129 --> 50:07.174
This is probably gonna be
the pivotal day of the trial

50:07.257 --> 50:10.594
because the medic, Corey Scott,
is going to testify.

50:10.677 --> 50:12.429
-Go, go get him. We got him.
-What's going on?

50:12.513 --> 50:16.266
And he's important
because he was closer to the stabbing.

50:16.350 --> 50:18.268
He saw it from maybe a foot away.

50:18.352 --> 50:23.941
And he not only saw the stabbing happen,
but stayed there until the captive died.

50:24.024 --> 50:25.984
So he can actually say,

50:26.068 --> 50:29.988
as a medical expert,
"Yes, this person died from those wounds."

50:30.072 --> 50:31.615
And that was gonna be…

50:33.158 --> 50:34.952
an earthquake for Eddie.

50:35.035 --> 50:37.246
Like, how do you survive that?

50:37.329 --> 50:38.622
The prosecution,

50:39.122 --> 50:44.002
you could get a sense of individuals
that they were worried about.

50:44.086 --> 50:47.673
You had some indication
that there was wild cards,

50:47.756 --> 50:52.511
and that there were things that--
potential surprises.

50:54.638 --> 50:58.600
As the morning started,
this really weird thing happened.

50:58.684 --> 51:01.436
Eddie had brought his kids
to the courtroom.

51:01.520 --> 51:05.691
I actually leaned over
to the reporter for the AP and asked,

51:05.774 --> 51:10.112
"Why would you bring your kids
to the trial on the day

51:10.195 --> 51:11.864
when you know
Corey Scott's gonna testify?"

51:11.947 --> 51:13.824
I mean, here's the guy who's gonna say,

51:13.907 --> 51:18.537
"I saw your dad stab this guy in the neck
multiple times and then this guy died."

51:19.913 --> 51:23.792
And the reporter for the AP is like,
"Something's up."

51:26.253 --> 51:27.838
I went in that day thinking that

51:27.921 --> 51:29.798
I didn't know what, really,
he was gonna say,

51:29.882 --> 51:31.341
but I did--

51:31.425 --> 51:33.427
When I walked in that day,
Corey was there,

51:33.510 --> 51:38.098
and he had come up, and we shook hands.

51:38.182 --> 51:41.518
And he just looked at me and was like,
"Everything's gonna be fine."

52:03.248 --> 52:04.958
When Corey Scott was on the stand,

52:05.042 --> 52:10.172
I was just trying to remain,
like, calm, stone--

52:10.255 --> 52:11.965
I would just not make
any facial expression.

52:13.425 --> 52:15.219
And I was more…

52:17.012 --> 52:19.348
interested to see, like,

52:19.431 --> 52:22.184
what he was gonna say
on the stand under oath.

52:39.284 --> 52:42.788
I can't recall verbatim
what he was saying.

52:43.288 --> 52:46.667
All I know is when the prosecution asked
if I had stabbed him, he said, "Yeah."

52:46.750 --> 52:49.503
To me, I was like, "What the fuck?"

52:49.586 --> 52:52.673
Like, okay, obviously this guy is--
he's full of shit.

53:19.157 --> 53:23.078
Asphyxiate is a very specific word.

53:23.161 --> 53:28.000
The dictionary definition is,
"Someone who is deprived of oxygen."

53:28.584 --> 53:30.961
So it doesn't mean
somebody had just stopped breathing.

53:31.795 --> 53:36.550
And when he said essentially he
was deprived of oxygen,

53:37.217 --> 53:38.552
and then he died,

53:39.178 --> 53:42.514
that to me was very different
from "die from a loss of blood."

53:43.182 --> 53:45.976
And why would he use that specific word?

53:46.059 --> 53:48.395
I knew that that was not
just him misspeaking,

53:48.478 --> 53:50.147
and he meant something else.

53:50.230 --> 53:51.565
That meant something.

54:48.205 --> 54:50.040
I'm standing at the podium,

54:50.123 --> 54:51.750
and I'm kinda holding on to the podium
'cause I…

54:53.168 --> 54:55.295
I can't believe that just happened.

54:55.379 --> 54:57.172
I know it happens on TV a lot,

54:57.256 --> 55:00.676
that somebody comes up
on the stand in the courtroom,

55:00.759 --> 55:04.096
and there's surprise testimony,
and everyone in the courtroom goes…

55:04.888 --> 55:07.432
But that is exactly what happened.

55:08.392 --> 55:10.769
Corey Scott threw such a bomb.

55:10.853 --> 55:14.106
His testimony completely
upended everything.

55:15.107 --> 55:18.318
I think everyone in the courtroom
was like, "Okay, what now?"

55:18.402 --> 55:21.113
It's a circus. It is a circus there.

55:21.196 --> 55:26.910
And so all of the media runs out,
and we're sitting there like, "What?"

55:26.994 --> 55:32.124
To me I was sort of like, a dude
just admitted to killing this fighter.

55:32.207 --> 55:34.626
But at the same time, I was more stuck on,

55:34.710 --> 55:37.462
"Why did he just--
Why did he still say I stabbed him?"

55:37.546 --> 55:39.756
Why both answers?

55:39.840 --> 55:43.051
So I was still just
sort of bewildered by it, like…

55:43.135 --> 55:45.053
This isn't over at all.
