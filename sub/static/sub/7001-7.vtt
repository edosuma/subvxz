01:13.079 --> 01:15.459
Boys, finish your breakfast.
Hurry up and brush your teeth.

01:15.560 --> 01:17.829
If you miss that bus.
you're gonna be in big, big trouble.

01:17.920 --> 01:23.750
Trouble already? Guys, pace yourselves.
You've got all day to be evil.

01:23.840 --> 01:26.909
You don't wanna peak too soon.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.349
- Give the old man a kiss goodbye.
- Did you brush?

01:29.439 --> 01:31.430
front and back.

01:32.400 --> 01:34.909
Oh, honey, honey, you're gonna have to
move my car, cos I'm blocking you.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.069
Why don't you just park
in your side of the driveway?

01:37.159 --> 01:38.750
Bikes.

01:38.840 --> 01:42.310
- I'll leave these in your car.
- OK, bye.

01:42.400 --> 01:44.230
Bye.

01:44.519 --> 01:46.510
- Mom?
- Yeah?

01:46.599 --> 01:49.109
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

01:49.200 --> 01:52.390
Do you think I have girls' hands?

01:52.480 --> 01:54.150
What?

01:54.239 --> 01:59.629
Jason Loomis says I have hands
like his sister, only smaller.

01:59.719 --> 02:02.230
That is ridiculous.
Look at these hands.

02:02.319 --> 02:05.390
They're strong, well-defined.

02:05.480 --> 02:10.189
With these hands, you could be
a painter or a surgeon.

02:10.280 --> 02:12.710
a concert pianist…

02:14.080 --> 02:17.860
A football player, karate champ,
Iumberjack, test pilot, construction worker…

02:17.960 --> 02:20.710
- Thanks, Mom.
- Oh!

02:20.800 --> 02:24.030
Brad. Mark, bus is here. Move it.

02:24.120 --> 02:25.469
- Kiss.
- Bye. Mom.

02:25.560 --> 02:28.949
- Bye. Kiss.
- Bye. Mom. Love ya.

02:29.039 --> 02:31.500
- Bye. Love you.
- Love you too.

02:35.039 --> 02:38.310
- Tim, you're still here?
- Oh, yeah.

02:40.719 --> 02:43.590
How long has the oil light been on. Jill?

02:44.719 --> 02:47.150
- Oil light…
- The oil light.

02:47.240 --> 02:50.150
Next to the speedometer.
A little red light with an oil can on it.

02:50.240 --> 02:51.710
Oh, that thing.
I don't know, mo or three days.

02:51.800 --> 02:54.389
Two or three days?

02:54.479 --> 02:57.229
It's a warning light. Didn't it occur to you
there might be a little problem?

02:57.319 --> 03:00.110
I thought if there was a problem
with the car.

03:00.199 --> 03:04.830
that the light would get brighter
or there would be a buzzer.

03:07.759 --> 03:09.349
A buzzer?

03:09.439 --> 03:11.870
It's a car, not a game show.

03:12.960 --> 03:17.750
- Tim, the car is running fine.
- It used to be running fine.

03:17.840 --> 03:20.870
Inside of a car
is an internal combustion engine.

03:20.960 --> 03:24.229
composed of many precision parts
running at a high RPM.

03:24.319 --> 03:28.020
High RPM produces friction.
friction produces heat.

03:28.120 --> 03:31.659
Heat is dissipated by lubrication - oil.

03:32.599 --> 03:35.509
When the car didn't get the oil
that it needs.

03:35.599 --> 03:38.310
it tends to seize up into a rock.

03:38.879 --> 03:42.270
Are you saying the car's not running?

03:43.879 --> 03:48.229
We now own a 4.000 pound.
four-door boulder.

03:49.879 --> 03:54.710
- You mean I can't drive it?
- Not unless you're Wilma Flintstone.

03:57.080 --> 03:59.189
OK. Tim. I've cut the molding
to the proper length.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.030
and by using our miter box here…

04:01.120 --> 04:03.750
- It's no good.
- It's a very good cut. Tim.

04:03.840 --> 04:06.590
Not talking about the cut
or the miter. It's…

04:06.680 --> 04:10.030
Something's bugging me, man.
I gotta get it off my chest.

04:10.120 --> 04:15.310
We don't normally do this.
but I wanna talk to y'all about respect.

04:16.279 --> 04:19.589
Respect for the machines
that power our lives.

04:19.680 --> 04:23.750
Yeah. I know this guy that found out his
wife's been driving the car for three days

04:23.839 --> 04:26.790
with the oil light on.

04:27.639 --> 04:29.939
No respect - none.

04:30.040 --> 04:35.269
My wife, she…
Not, not my wife. This guy's wife

04:37.160 --> 04:40.230
didn't even think about that engine.

04:40.319 --> 04:44.430
- I hear ya, man.
- You know what I'm talking about?

04:44.519 --> 04:46.870
My wife's the same way.

04:47.839 --> 04:52.029
Really? Come on down here.
Get this guy down here. Come on.

04:58.439 --> 05:02.139
- Nice to meet ya. Love your show.
- Thanks. What's your name?

05:02.240 --> 05:05.430
- Jim. My friends call me Jimbo.
- I'm…

05:06.920 --> 05:09.750
I'm Tim.
You can call me Timbo.

05:10.759 --> 05:16.069
- So, what's on your mind, Jimbo?
- Well, Timbo, I work construction.

05:16.160 --> 05:18.310
Yeah.

05:18.399 --> 05:19.670
- Hey, wait a minute. Hold that.
- But I…

05:19.759 --> 05:21.790
Sit down here for a minute.

05:21.879 --> 05:26.350
Grab a stool here. Plant it and tell me
what's on your mind there, buddy.

05:26.439 --> 05:28.389
- But I'm really into woodworking.
- Great.

05:28.480 --> 05:32.149
I do a lot of carving and I just bought
myself a serious set of chisels.

05:32.240 --> 05:37.259
Probably like the Binford 600 series.
You used them last week, Al.

05:40.199 --> 05:42.550
Anyway, uh…

05:43.920 --> 05:47.829
The other day. I come home
and there's my wife out in the garage…

05:47.920 --> 05:50.949
Where she doesn't belong.

05:55.319 --> 05:57.269
And she's…

05:57.360 --> 06:02.300
She's prying the lid off a gallon can of paint
with my three-eighths-inch skew chisel.

06:02.399 --> 06:04.829
Oh, jeez.

06:06.040 --> 06:09.190
And they wonder why we die first.

06:12.079 --> 06:15.750
- Can I say something, Tim?
- Shop floor's open, buddy.

06:15.839 --> 06:19.790
- Pardon me.
- Oh, heck, we hooked a big one.

06:19.879 --> 06:21.870
Excuse me.

06:25.920 --> 06:27.990
- Hey.
- Name's Kyle.

06:28.079 --> 06:29.829
Hi, Kyle. Timbo, Jimbo.

06:29.920 --> 06:31.550
- Jimbo.
- Hey, Kyle.

06:31.639 --> 06:33.509
Hey, sit down.
What's on your mind?

06:33.600 --> 06:38.459
Well, Tim. I enjoy gardening.
I like to grow my own vegetables.

06:40.560 --> 06:42.430
Well…

06:45.600 --> 06:48.589
Can't be all vegetables, man.

06:51.240 --> 06:56.069
Looks like you've socked
a couple dozen donuts away or something.

06:56.160 --> 06:58.910
You know it, Tim.
Love my donuts.

06:59.000 --> 07:04.230
Anyway, my wife uses my good gardening
tools and she leaves them in the yard.

07:04.319 --> 07:08.149
Tim, every tool I own
has suffered some degree of rust damage.

07:08.240 --> 07:13.029
Oh. If your wife was here right now,
what would you say to her?

07:13.120 --> 07:16.629
I don't know. I'd probably say:

07:16.720 --> 07:18.509
"Ginger,

07:25.040 --> 07:28.660
when you don't respect my tools,
you don't respect me."

07:28.759 --> 07:30.949
"So, stop it"

07:36.600 --> 07:39.310
I wish I could say something like that
to my wife.

07:39.399 --> 07:42.550
She's got a hundred bottles in the shower.

07:42.639 --> 07:45.430
Yeah, conditioners
and shampoos and rinses.

07:45.519 --> 07:49.990
- What does she need all that stuff for?
- Yeah. Yeah.

07:50.079 --> 07:52.870
- That's nothing, my wife…
- Ginger.

07:52.959 --> 07:57.709
My wife has these
mo-and-three-quarter-inch press-on-nails.

07:57.800 --> 08:01.670
Well. I'm at home watching
Circ4s of the Stars, and I hear this tapping.

08:01.759 --> 08:06.029
I look over at the wife. She's tapping with
her fingernail on the front of her teeth.

08:06.120 --> 08:07.670
Drives me nuts.

08:07.759 --> 08:09.629
You think that's bad.
my wife does a thing in the shower…

08:09.720 --> 08:13.870
Wait a minute. I topped you both.
My wife drools in her sleep.

08:13.959 --> 08:17.350
- Disgusting.
- And I'm not talking about a little puddle.

08:17.439 --> 08:21.350
I'm talking about. "Hook up the hose.
let's water the lawn."

08:21.439 --> 08:22.660
No, no, no.

08:22.759 --> 08:26.350
"Man the lifeboats, she's drooling:'
Get in.

08:26.439 --> 08:28.389
She's drooling, drooling

08:28.480 --> 08:30.110
Drooling down the river

08:30.199 --> 08:32.710
Drooling, drooling.
drooling down the river

08:32.799 --> 08:34.990
- Tim.
- What is it. Al? Come on, join in.

08:35.080 --> 08:37.710
- Drooling…
- We only have a few minutes left. Tim.

08:37.799 --> 08:40.990
Al, we're having
an important discussion here.

08:41.080 --> 08:43.269
About drool. Tim?

08:45.039 --> 08:48.509
Wouldn't expect you to understand.
You're not married.

08:48.600 --> 08:51.350
Well, enough about your love life. Al.
Let's get some work.

08:51.440 --> 08:52.500
- You guys wanna help me out?
- Great.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.269
- Sure.
- All right.

08:55.279 --> 08:58.029
- We're gonna watch Dad's show.
- OK.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.990
- When I hear this tapping…
- Hey. Mom, who's that guy?

09:03.080 --> 09:07.470
I don't know. Do you have the right
channel? Here, give me the thing.

09:07.559 --> 09:11.070
- Yeah, there's Dad.
- Oh. Well, what is he up to now?

09:11.159 --> 09:16.309
Wait, wait, wait. I've got you both beat.
My wife drools in her sleep.

09:18.720 --> 09:21.870
Uh, boys. I think you should
go upstairs and play.

09:21.960 --> 09:24.710
- We wanna watch Dad's show.
- I said out.

09:32.639 --> 09:35.309
- Tim?
- I know what you're gonna say.

09:35.399 --> 09:40.419
I've already decided I'm not gonna say
another word about the oil light.

09:40.519 --> 09:44.429
You made a mistake, anybody can
make a mistake and I forgive you.

09:44.519 --> 09:48.830
She's drooling, she's drooling.
she's drooling down the river.

09:51.399 --> 09:53.750
You saw the show, huh?

09:55.320 --> 09:56.950
Tim, how could you do that?

09:57.039 --> 09:58.710
You and I joke about it all the time.
We laugh about your…

09:58.799 --> 10:00.350
No, you and I joke about it
all the time

10:00.440 --> 10:03.350
in the privacy of our bedroom,
not on television.

10:03.440 --> 10:06.389
What, you have rocks in your head?
Don't you think?

10:06.480 --> 10:07.990
Let's talk about who didn't think
for a minute.

10:08.080 --> 10:10.269
Who drove around for two days
with the oil light on?

10:10.360 --> 10:12.740
Wait. I thought you said
you weren't going to bring up the oil light?

10:12.840 --> 10:17.269
With all those rocks in my head.
sometimes I don't know what I'm saying.

10:17.360 --> 10:21.990
Look, my mistake involved a car.
Your mistake involved a human being.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.269
Me. There's a big difference here.

10:24.360 --> 10:27.789
Of course I don't expect you to understand
that, since you're completely insensitive.

10:27.879 --> 10:28.509
Insensitive?

10:28.600 --> 10:32.269
You didn't even think
about how I would feel.

10:32.360 --> 10:35.350
Why… I didn't tell them everything.

10:40.120 --> 10:42.230
Everything?

10:42.320 --> 10:46.190
You know when you roll on your side,
you gurgle?

10:47.600 --> 10:49.629
What, are you saving that
for the Christmas special?

10:49.720 --> 10:51.710
No.

10:57.440 --> 11:00.830
- Mommy. I'm worried.
- About what, honey?

11:00.919 --> 11:06.190
If you drool and sleep on your back.
won't you drown?

11:17.360 --> 11:19.389
No, honey.

11:19.480 --> 11:22.629
Thank you for your concern.
Eat a carrot.

11:22.720 --> 11:24.309
Randy!

11:25.039 --> 11:28.909
It's all over school about what
Jason Loomis said about your girl hands.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.429
Oh, no.

11:30.519 --> 11:33.190
- But I stood up for you.
- Good for you, Brad.

11:33.279 --> 11:35.840
And I got you a little something
to make you feel better.

11:35.919 --> 11:37.350
What is it?

11:37.440 --> 11:40.789
Passion Pink fingernail polish.

11:40.879 --> 11:43.230
- You meanie.
- Brad Taylor.

11:43.600 --> 11:46.159
Hi.

11:46.240 --> 11:49.149
What are you doing?

11:49.240 --> 11:51.470
I was thinking about what you said
in the garage about that drool thing

11:51.559 --> 11:52.620
and you were right.

11:52.720 --> 11:57.230
I overstepped my bounds
and I was really insensitive.

11:57.799 --> 12:03.389
You notice I paused there, in case
you want to say. "I forgive you, Tim".

12:05.039 --> 12:07.230
it would fit right here.

12:08.039 --> 12:12.549
Or not. Come on, Jill.
are you ever gonna talk to me again?

12:12.639 --> 12:15.070
I just want to know one thing.

12:15.159 --> 12:18.669
What does my drooling have to do
with home improvement?

12:18.759 --> 12:21.830
Well, no one likes to
live in a damp house.

12:28.159 --> 12:30.230
Wrong answer.

12:30.320 --> 12:34.950
What does my drooling
have to do with home improvement?

12:35.559 --> 12:37.590
Nothing.

12:38.279 --> 12:41.980
So you just got up and said,
"Oh, what a beautiful morning."

12:42.080 --> 12:44.149
"I think I'll humiliate my wife today."

12:44.240 --> 12:46.669
I was just telling stories
on the show with these guys

12:46.759 --> 12:49.220
and I brought up the oil light
and we seized the motor…

12:49.320 --> 12:52.990
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
You told them about the oil light?

12:53.080 --> 12:55.379
Uh-oh.

12:56.399 --> 12:59.549
- Why did you do that?
- I don't know.

12:59.639 --> 13:02.019
Why did you go on TV
and humiliate me?

13:02.120 --> 13:04.789
I don't know.

13:05.440 --> 13:07.230
I got a good idea.

13:07.320 --> 13:10.309
Why don't you just change the name
of your show from Tool Time

13:10.400 --> 13:12.389
to My Stupid Wife.

13:21.080 --> 13:23.590
- Hi. Wilson.
- Hi-ho. Tim.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.460
Another glorious autumn afternoon.

13:27.559 --> 13:30.230
- Boy, it sure is.
- And you're burning leaves.

13:30.320 --> 13:35.590
Occasionally I like to throw a handful
on the old barbecue and just sniff.

13:35.679 --> 13:37.190
Try to remember the old days.

13:37.279 --> 13:39.950
I got a little problem.
Can I ask you a question, Wilson?

13:40.039 --> 13:43.629
Ball is in your court, Tim. Wail away.

13:43.720 --> 13:47.950
I said something real stupid.
I embarrassed Jill on my TV show.

13:48.039 --> 13:50.149
Hmm, why did you do that, Tim?

13:50.240 --> 13:53.149
I don't know.
I was talking with the other guys

13:53.240 --> 13:55.429
and we were sharing
silly stories about our wives.

13:55.519 --> 13:58.909
and I had a great one about Jill
and it just came out.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.990
Well, Tim, it sounds to me
like you're a victim

14:01.080 --> 14:05.549
of the hierarchical structure
of male conversation.

14:08.559 --> 14:12.509
Hi, har, harical…

14:12.600 --> 14:17.789
- How do you spell that?
- Let's just say one-upmanship.

14:20.720 --> 14:24.950
See, Tim, men's relationships
are based on status and power.

14:28.080 --> 14:30.110
Men feel compelled
to outdo each other.

14:30.200 --> 14:32.350
If one man tells a story
about his wife.

14:32.440 --> 14:35.070
the next man feels he's got to
tell an even better story.

14:35.159 --> 14:37.429
That was exactly what happened.

14:37.519 --> 14:41.220
I got caught up in that
h-hi-hiarchal thing.

14:42.399 --> 14:44.429
Happens all the time, Tim.

14:44.519 --> 14:46.820
Well, I don't want it to happen.
How do you make it stop?

14:46.919 --> 14:51.909
Well. Tim, men have to learn
to compete less and listen more.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.950
We have to learn
to start sharing our feelings.

14:56.039 --> 14:57.259
Hey, yeah.

14:58.720 --> 15:01.100
Thank you all. Thank you.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.500
A lot of people have said to me.
"I saw the show the other day

15:03.600 --> 15:06.389
with all the guy talk.
What was that all about?"

15:06.480 --> 15:09.549
Well, mostly it was about
getting in trouble with our wives.

15:09.639 --> 15:12.870
No kiddin'.
Ginger's living with her mother.

15:12.960 --> 15:16.269
Well, on today's show, we're gonna see
if we can straighten things out.

15:16.360 --> 15:19.950
- Al. I got a seat for ya.
- No, thank you, Tim.

15:23.440 --> 15:27.870
Well. Tool Time is more than just
home improvement, it's male improvement.

15:27.960 --> 15:32.110
An improved male is more sensitive
to his wife. How do we get sensitive?

15:32.200 --> 15:35.350
By digging deep down in our emotions
and sharing our feelings with others.

15:35.440 --> 15:38.029
You guys up to it?

15:40.279 --> 15:43.669
I thought we were gonna get
to use the tools.

15:44.799 --> 15:48.950
Not today. Jimbo.
What are you feeling?

15:49.039 --> 15:54.590
Well. I guess I'm feeling confused.
I was looking forward to using the tools.

15:54.679 --> 15:58.750
- Any other feelings?
- I'm feeling hungry.

15:58.840 --> 16:02.029
Hey. Good?
That's a good feeling there. Kyle.

16:02.120 --> 16:04.990
How about you, what are you feeling?

16:05.080 --> 16:10.200
I was feeling fine until Jimbo here
said he was feeling hungry.

16:11.559 --> 16:14.629
Now I'm feeling hungry.

16:14.720 --> 16:17.429
And that makes me mad.

16:18.639 --> 16:20.940
Why is that?

16:21.039 --> 16:25.309
Because I want a big ol' piece of pork.

16:25.399 --> 16:27.779
and my doctor said it's too fatty.

16:27.879 --> 16:30.029
What the hell did I have
that bypass for anyway?

16:30.120 --> 16:31.990
- Hey. Settle down, man.
- I want some pork, dammit.

16:32.080 --> 16:35.230
All right, all right, all right.

16:37.519 --> 16:42.070
Let's steer clear
of the meat products for a minute.

16:42.159 --> 16:44.950
Let's talk about real emotion.

16:45.039 --> 16:47.549
Cr yin 9.

16:47.639 --> 16:49.629
When was the last time you cried?

16:49.720 --> 16:52.549
Tim .

16:52.639 --> 16:56.029
You mean "cried" cried or "cried
because something heavy fell on you"?

16:56.120 --> 16:58.389
- Once I dropped this spinet piano on my…
- No, no, no, no, no.

16:58.480 --> 17:03.750
I need an emotional experience.
A deep one that we can share with all of us.

17:03.840 --> 17:09.150
Well, now that I think of it,
there was one time when I almost cried.

17:09.240 --> 17:11.700
Let it go, man.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.710
It was 1968.

17:16.799 --> 17:20.868
- The Tigers won the World Series.
- Oh, man. That was unbelievable.

17:20.960 --> 17:23.230
- It was like six home runs.
- Yeah.

17:23.319 --> 17:25.430
Whoa, talk about emotions.
Talk about emotions.

17:25.519 --> 17:28.108
- '84 they took the Padres, remember that?
- No comparison.

17:28.200 --> 17:30.150
I'm talking '68.
when baseball was baseball.

17:30.240 --> 17:31.430
- You got that right, man.
- Yeah.

17:31.519 --> 17:34.150
Tiger Stadium used to serve up
a great pork sausage.

17:34.240 --> 17:36.619
Yes. I know.

17:36.720 --> 17:40.420
I tell you, now you go out there.
for a buck 85, what do you get?

17:40.519 --> 17:43.390
- I know what you're talkin'.
- A hot dog.

17:43.480 --> 17:48.230
Two bites and it's gone, huh? I mean, you
gotta burp to find out what it tastes like.

17:48.319 --> 17:50.309
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:52.079 --> 17:52.829
Oh.

17:52.920 --> 17:56.670
Oh, good night, nurse, I'm spent.

17:56.759 --> 17:57.869
Oh.

17:57.960 --> 17:59.630
Uh. Tim?

17:59.720 --> 18:01.789
You wanna get back to work.

18:01.880 --> 18:05.069
No. Tim. I was thinking about
what you said the other day.

18:05.160 --> 18:09.950
about how I wouldn't understand what
you were talking about until I was married.

18:10.039 --> 18:12.500
- So?
- Made me feel like I was desperate.

18:12.599 --> 18:15.789
Iike I would never be able to find
someone who'd marry me.

18:15.880 --> 18:17.750
I didn't… That's not…
I didn't… That's not what l meant.

18:17.839 --> 18:21.829
Well, I just wanted you to know
that it really hurt me.

18:26.480 --> 18:29.950
Hey, hey, hey.
Al just shared a feeling.

18:30.039 --> 18:32.599
That's… That's…
Yeah, that's all.

18:32.680 --> 18:35.029
Why don't we get to that circular saw now?
That's what we ought to do.

18:35.119 --> 18:39.390
I mean, well, you have a wife and a family.
You have no idea what it's like

18:39.480 --> 18:42.430
coming home to an empty one-bedroom
apartment every night.

18:42.519 --> 18:45.230
Al, you've got a great-looking apartment.
I've been there, it's nice.

18:45.319 --> 18:49.829
Well. I just… I just think
you wouldn't kid me so much if you knew

18:49.920 --> 18:53.430
well, just how very, very lonely I am.

19:01.680 --> 19:05.190
- I'm going back to my seat.
- No kidding.

19:07.839 --> 19:09.390
Al, hey, buddy…

19:13.640 --> 19:18.470
It's male improvement. And the improved
male is sensitive to his wife's needs.

19:18.559 --> 19:21.470
And how do we get sensitive?
By reaching down deep,

19:21.559 --> 19:25.910
getting in touch with our emotions
and sharing our feelings with others.

19:31.079 --> 19:33.829
Yeah.

19:33.920 --> 19:37.789
- Yeah, you did it. Dad.
- You got the car running. Excellent.

19:37.880 --> 19:39.549
Yeah.

19:39.759 --> 19:41.549
Yeah.

19:43.640 --> 19:47.069
Master mechanic triumphs.

19:47.160 --> 19:49.950
Dad did an awesome job,
didn't he, Mom?

19:50.039 --> 19:54.190
Yeah. Yeah, he really did. Boys,
why don't you go wash up before dinner?

19:54.279 --> 19:56.740
- OK.
- OK.

20:05.119 --> 20:08.990
So you put a lot of work into that car.

20:10.119 --> 20:14.150
Not really. Just had to remove
the damaged short block,

20:14.240 --> 20:16.230
get all the damaged parts out,
got a new short block,

20:16.319 --> 20:18.230
had it milled and bored for me.

20:18.319 --> 20:22.190
New piston rings, connecting rods,
main bearings, oil pump, fuel pump,

20:22.279 --> 20:26.059
water pump, upper motor,
polish and port the heads,

20:26.160 --> 20:30.910
a new canooter valve,
rewired it, add more…

20:31.000 --> 20:35.150
Add a little more power,
but that's about it, hon.

20:35.240 --> 20:40.509
I didn't realize that that little oil light
could be such a big problem.

20:40.599 --> 20:43.670
It's just a car, honey.

20:43.759 --> 20:46.319
It's not a human being.

20:46.400 --> 20:52.190
It's not like the human being
I love more than anything else in the world.

20:54.759 --> 20:58.460
You know why I like tools?
Because they fix things.

20:58.559 --> 21:03.109
Tear down a motor, see the problem.
it's right there - boom, it's fixed.

21:03.200 --> 21:06.710
I wish I could fix things
between us that easily.

21:07.559 --> 21:10.869
Is that an apology?

21:10.960 --> 21:16.079
I don't think I can apologize enough
for the things I do.

21:16.160 --> 21:20.750
All I can offer is a lifetime
of grovelling at your feet.

21:22.039 --> 21:25.430
That'd be a start.

21:25.519 --> 21:28.910
I promise in the future
I will always put oil in the car.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.829
And I'll say nice things about your hair.

21:31.920 --> 21:35.150
- While grovelling?
- You bet.

21:41.160 --> 21:43.990
I'm… I'm prepared to offer cash gifts.

22:01.599 --> 22:03.670
- Al.
- Tim.

22:08.319 --> 22:10.549
So?

22:10.640 --> 22:12.710
So.

22:13.839 --> 22:17.829
Hey, that's a nice-looking shirt.
Is it brand-new?

22:20.079 --> 22:22.869
No, it's an old one.

22:26.440 --> 22:29.390
Well, it looks really good on you.

22:33.359 --> 22:35.309
Thanks.

22:40.799 --> 22:45.950
Hey, maybe some girl will see you
in that shirt and want to marry you.

22:49.200 --> 22:51.869
Thanks. Tim. I appreciate that.
