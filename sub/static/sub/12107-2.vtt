Maybe they're right, Lincoln.

09:32.703 --> 09:34.703

09:34.705 --> 09:35.604
All they do is meddle.

09:35.606 --> 09:36.705
- They're girls, Lincoln.

09:36.707 --> 09:39.208
They know more about
these things then we do.

09:39.210 --> 09:40.443
It's a scientific fact.

09:40.445 --> 09:44.346
- Yeah, but there's no way
that--wow, me?

09:44.348 --> 09:46.248
You really think
she might like me?

09:46.250 --> 09:46.949
How would I know?

09:46.951 --> 09:48.884
- There's only one way
to find out.

09:48.886 --> 09:51.954
- Kiss her! Kiss her!
- Hold it!

Lana, breath mint.

10:07.371 --> 10:08.904
Let's do this.

10:08.906 --> 10:10.206

10:10.208 --> 10:11.807
- You so got this,
little bro.

10:11.809 --> 10:13.442

10:13.444 --> 10:17.279

[blows nose]

10:17.281 --> 10:18.114

10:18.116 --> 10:19.648

you gave it a shot.

10:36.501 --> 10:37.900

for that shiner.

10:37.902 --> 10:38.834

10:38.836 --> 10:41.003

[overlapping chatter]

10:41.005 --> 10:43.272
