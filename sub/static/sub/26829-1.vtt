00:16.651 --> 00:17.870
We are all hypocrites.

00:18.920 --> 00:21.000
We say don't lie, but we lie.

00:22.070 --> 00:25.099
We say don't lust, but we lust.

00:25.100 --> 00:27.119
We say don't covet, but we covet.

00:27.120 --> 00:32.768
We say we've found the
way and yet we seem lost.

00:32.769 --> 00:35.828
We are foolish pathetic people

00:35.829 --> 00:38.899
tragically suffering from the
same ills we claim to cure.

00:40.310 --> 00:45.078
This is how the world sees us.
And if we can't change why should they?

00:45.079 --> 00:49.188
Why call the gospel good news
if it doesn't work?

00:49.189 --> 00:53.258
If Christ died for our sins...

00:55.268 --> 00:57.338
Why do we keep on sinning?

00:59.358 --> 01:01.468
Why?

01:03.498 --> 01:05.062
Why?

01:22.067 --> 01:24.761
The Apostle Paul faced
a similar conundrum.

01:26.168 --> 01:28.827
Let's open our bibles
to Romans chapter 7.

01:41.696 --> 01:43.156
Hey there, Pastor.

01:43.986 --> 01:45.265
Hello, Leah.

01:45.266 --> 01:47.286
Hope you don't mind me
letting myself in.

01:47.856 --> 01:50.405
I do mind.
As I've said before.

01:50.406 --> 01:53.535
Great talk today.
Rocked my world as usual.

01:53.536 --> 01:54.596
Thanks.

01:55.646 --> 01:57.232
Are you really getting
something out of it?

01:57.685 --> 01:59.735
You give it, I'll get it, Pastor.

02:00.775 --> 02:02.804
But you never speak up in class.

02:02.805 --> 02:04.834
You know, if you're having
a hard time following,

02:04.835 --> 02:06.905
you could also try the 'Seeker's Study'.

02:07.365 --> 02:09.014
That wouldn't work for my schedule.

02:09.115 --> 02:13.075
You see, I'm pushing 30 and I've
got to be where the singles are.

02:15.084 --> 02:19.055
What's it take for a girl to
get a little private tutoring?

02:19.614 --> 02:22.893
- A change in church policy.
- Really?

02:22.894 --> 02:27.003
Because I talked to Pastor
Campbell the lead pastor

02:27.004 --> 02:29.063
and he thought it was a great idea.

02:29.064 --> 02:31.143
Well, then maybe he should tutor you.

02:31.144 --> 02:34.757
It wouldn't be inappropriate
for an uncle to tutor his niece.

02:34.844 --> 02:38.193
But he doesn't get me excited
about the bible the way you do.

02:38.274 --> 02:41.413
Well, the policy is very clear.

02:41.414 --> 02:44.628
A pastor can't be in any situation
where there might be temptation.

02:45.473 --> 02:47.513
I can see
how that would be a problem.

02:48.303 --> 02:50.569
If the girl's not into
that sort of thing.

02:50.623 --> 02:54.713
Thank you for stopping by, Leah.
Second service is starting soon.

02:55.753 --> 02:57.247
Will you be speaking in it?

02:58.199 --> 03:02.533
Oh, that's right.
You don't speak in big church.

03:03.513 --> 03:06.751
But maybe I could talk
to my uncle about that?

03:06.752 --> 03:07.801
That won't be necessary.

03:07.802 --> 03:10.892
I already talk to Pastor Campbell
all the time.

03:16.022 --> 03:19.131
- Pastor Campbell!
- Hello Jacob.

03:19.132 --> 03:20.161
Did you get my email?

03:20.162 --> 03:22.192
Yes, the one about the budget
for your books?

03:23.242 --> 03:25.311
No, that was last week.

03:25.312 --> 03:28.440
This one was asking when I might preach
my first sermon in the main service.

03:28.441 --> 03:29.490
A good idea for another time.

03:29.491 --> 03:31.590
We only allow ordained pastors
to preach here.

03:31.591 --> 03:34.660
Nothing against you.
Just protecting the pulpit, that's all.

03:34.661 --> 03:36.656
I understand.

03:36.691 --> 03:39.770
Which is why I thought now might be a
good time to start the ordination process.

03:39.771 --> 03:41.810
I haven't forgotten your desire
to be ordained.

03:41.811 --> 03:43.851
Especially since you keep reminding me.

03:44.901 --> 03:47.990
Well to be honest, Pastor, I don't
understand why it hasn't happened yet.

03:47.991 --> 03:50.079
And I don't understand
the sense of urgency.

03:50.080 --> 03:52.119
You're young, Jacob.

03:52.120 --> 03:54.149
The ordained pastors would
all like to be your age again.

03:54.150 --> 03:56.219
When they were my age
they were already ordained.

03:56.220 --> 04:00.350
I admire the enthusiasm but there's only
so many ways you can say the same thing.

04:00.609 --> 04:04.339
Is there anything specific holding
you back? Anything I can work on?

04:04.340 --> 04:06.350
Just keep up the good work
with the membership class

04:06.351 --> 04:08.528
and ordination will come in due time.

04:27.749 --> 04:29.788
Rachel?

04:30.483 --> 04:33.191
Rachel!
You left your door open.

04:33.431 --> 04:34.843
Again.

04:37.727 --> 04:40.128
I'm just gonna close it for you.
Okay?

04:42.928 --> 04:46.558
I can manage my own door, thanks.

04:47.588 --> 04:49.608
You left it open when
you went to the store?

04:50.039 --> 04:51.636
It appears so.

04:51.991 --> 04:55.426
- You know that's not safe.
- Not with you prowling around.

04:55.656 --> 04:57.530
- Did you steal anything?
- No.

04:57.547 --> 05:00.076
You could if you wanted.
I wouldn't tell.

05:00.356 --> 05:02.786
Thanks, but I already have all I need.

05:02.787 --> 05:04.847
If you had that you wouldn't stop by.

05:05.887 --> 05:07.996
- So how've you been?
- All right.

05:07.997 --> 05:09.037
Work's a little slow.

05:10.087 --> 05:11.146
I'm glad to hear it.

05:11.147 --> 05:14.256
I'm taking new clients
if you know anyone.

05:14.257 --> 05:18.385
I don't, but if I do
I'll be sure to discourage them.

05:18.386 --> 05:21.495
Why don't you try me yourself?
You'd see I'm worth recommending.

05:21.496 --> 05:22.526
Very funny.

05:23.596 --> 05:26.665
I don't suppose you looked at
that job training info I left for you?

05:26.666 --> 05:28.765
To be a secretary?
Seriously?

05:28.766 --> 05:30.815
They can have you job ready
in two days.

05:30.816 --> 05:33.875
I make more in an hour than
a secretary does in a week.

05:33.876 --> 05:35.986
Yes, but the secretary
has less to worry about.

05:37.026 --> 05:39.065
My work doesn't worry me
like it worries you.

05:39.066 --> 05:41.124
I know.
That's what worries me.

05:41.125 --> 05:44.254
- How's work for you?
- The same.

05:44.255 --> 05:47.344
Still teaching membership classes
to people who are already members.

05:47.345 --> 05:51.454
- If you hate your job you should quit.
- I don't hate my job. I love my job.

05:51.455 --> 05:54.514
- I hate not being able to do it.
- Then find someplace where you can.

05:54.515 --> 05:57.594
- Life's short.
- Actually, life is eternal.

05:57.595 --> 05:59.675
Which is about how long
it took me to find this job.

06:00.705 --> 06:03.803
You know I never understood why you all
think eternity is such a selling point.

06:03.804 --> 06:05.894
No one wants to spend eternity
with you.

06:06.924 --> 06:08.444
Always nice chatting with you, Rachel.

06:09.004 --> 06:11.124
Where are you going?
Keep me company.

06:13.244 --> 06:15.373
I can't.
I have to study.

06:15.374 --> 06:18.454
Come by any time.
My door's always open.

06:28.759 --> 06:30.355
Hello, Jacob.

06:31.107 --> 06:32.843
Pastor Campbell, hello.

06:33.365 --> 06:36.038
- How's everything going?
- Fine.

06:36.543 --> 06:38.863
I see you haven't wasted much time
decorating your office.

06:39.613 --> 06:42.602
I don't mind the bare walls.
I don't look at anything but the books.

06:42.603 --> 06:44.732
Yes, but the decorations
aren't for you.

06:44.733 --> 06:46.771
They're for the people
that stop by your office.

06:46.772 --> 06:48.841
So they'll know what you're about.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.852
Then they'll know
I'm about the books.

06:54.122 --> 06:56.859
So what brings you by?

06:56.901 --> 07:00.861
I was thinking about how you're the
only unmarried pastor on the staff.

07:01.172 --> 07:06.170
- How's that going for you?
- Well, it's difficult to be honest.

07:06.425 --> 07:09.640
I feel like I'm not given the same
respect as the married pastors.

07:09.641 --> 07:12.962
Well, that happens. But what I'm
asking is how's the search going?

07:13.081 --> 07:14.638
Oh, that.

07:15.171 --> 07:17.230
Not so well.

07:17.231 --> 07:19.330
How come?

07:19.331 --> 07:23.460
I guess I'm having a hard time connecting
with people since I've been back.

07:23.461 --> 07:25.500
It kind of feels like
I'm in another country.

07:25.501 --> 07:26.550
Again.

07:26.551 --> 07:28.960
- And you never had anyone in Kenya?
- Nope.

07:28.961 --> 07:32.962
- Because I was in Uganda.
- Well, you're home now.

07:33.134 --> 07:35.788
And that's what women want...
someone home.

07:36.537 --> 07:40.769
And the way I see you smiling
it makes me think you found someone.

07:40.770 --> 07:43.879
- What?
- I know that look Jacob.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.909
You've got your eye on somebody,
haven't you?

07:45.910 --> 07:48.999
- No.
- Don't lie to your pastor, Jacob.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.049
I would never.

07:50.050 --> 07:52.100
But you're not telling me
everything, are you?

07:53.159 --> 07:57.248
Well, there is someone but
I've hardly considered it.

07:57.249 --> 07:58.308
Why's that?

07:58.309 --> 08:01.408
There would be quite a few
obstacles to overcome.

08:01.409 --> 08:03.489
There always are.
For a worthy lady.

08:04.549 --> 08:06.558
I don't suppose you'll tell me
who she is?

08:06.559 --> 08:07.618
I'd rather not.

08:07.619 --> 08:10.688
The more you tell me
the more advice I can give.

08:10.689 --> 08:14.859
- I appreciate that but I'd rather not.
- Okay then.

08:19.698 --> 08:22.027
Jacob, I've a confession to make.

08:22.028 --> 08:25.098
I'm well aware that
the lady in question is my niece.

08:26.148 --> 08:28.167
Don't look so surprised.

08:28.168 --> 08:30.227
You must have known
I'd learn eventually.

08:30.228 --> 08:32.277
And how did you come
to this conclusion?

08:32.278 --> 08:34.317
She told me about your interesting
conversation yesterday.

08:34.318 --> 08:36.628
Interesting conversation?

08:36.698 --> 08:40.265
How you were worried about violating
church policy if you two were alone

08:40.267 --> 08:42.506
because you're so attracted to her.

08:43.557 --> 08:45.616
Pastor, I don't want to give you
the wrong impression.

08:45.617 --> 08:49.686
Don't be embarrassed, Jacob.
She's a beautiful woman.

08:49.687 --> 08:51.726
I'm not surprised
your passion's been aroused.

08:51.727 --> 08:52.786
Okay, I should clarify.

08:52.787 --> 08:55.846
You see, Leah and I we were
talking about church policy, but...

08:55.847 --> 08:57.907
That's something I should clarify...

08:58.236 --> 09:00.785
The policy isn't there to keep apart

09:00.786 --> 09:03.025
two single people who want
to get to know each other.

09:03.026 --> 09:04.075
Okay, but...

09:04.076 --> 09:07.509
I respect your desire
to be above reproach.

09:07.609 --> 09:10.175
And because she is
so involved with our church

09:10.176 --> 09:12.215
you're right in thinking there
are obstacles to overcome.

09:12.216 --> 09:14.255
With more appearing every day.

09:14.256 --> 09:16.305
But if you want to spend
more time with her

09:16.306 --> 09:19.385
my wife and I are having
a dinner party on Friday.

09:19.386 --> 09:22.464
I see.
And Leah asked you to invite me.

09:22.465 --> 09:25.257
Hey.
No asking me if she likes you.

09:25.271 --> 09:27.117
You'll have to ask her that yourself.

09:27.339 --> 09:30.534
Listen, you don't need to have
a dinner party just for me.

09:30.629 --> 09:33.883
It's for all the pastors.
We do them every few weeks or so.

09:34.675 --> 09:36.904
But this is the first one
since I've been here?

09:36.905 --> 09:39.954
The arrangements for this one are
different because we have a special guest...

09:39.955 --> 09:42.534
Jim Callahan.
You've heard of him?

09:42.616 --> 09:45.173
Yeah, of course.
I've read all his books.

09:45.174 --> 09:48.303
His books on marriage?
Leah will be delighted to hear it.

09:48.304 --> 09:51.443
- I studied them for my thesis.
- Did you?

09:51.444 --> 09:53.982
Yeah, my thesis on the
theology of marriage.

09:54.017 --> 09:55.431
Is that right?

09:55.574 --> 09:57.294
Please tell me
you at least read the title.

09:57.334 --> 09:58.894
Anyway, he's looking to expand

09:58.974 --> 10:01.723
the Marriage Coalition out West
and he's looking for partner churches.

10:01.724 --> 10:03.773
And the dinner is to show him
he should work with us?

10:03.774 --> 10:06.852
Working with Dr. Callahan
would be a fine feather in our cap.

10:06.853 --> 10:09.013
Churches tend to double in size
when he gets involved.

10:09.963 --> 10:12.938
Leah's been begging me to go but
I wasn't sure about having someone solo.

10:12.939 --> 10:16.113
However, we could make room
for another pair.

10:18.143 --> 10:23.272
- I'll need to speak with Leah first.
- Trust me, Jacob. She's in if you are.

10:23.273 --> 10:24.473
I'd still like to talk to her.

10:27.743 --> 10:30.361
- Hey there, Pastor.
- Do you have a minute?

10:30.362 --> 10:34.561
- Sure, come in. I'll put some music on.
- That won't be necessary.

10:34.562 --> 10:37.681
- Straight to the point then.
- Something like that.

10:37.682 --> 10:42.742
I had a talk with Pastor Campbell today
and he had some funny ideas about us.

10:43.742 --> 10:44.821
Us?

10:44.822 --> 10:47.968
See, he seemed to think that our
conversation about church policy

10:47.969 --> 10:50.330
was my way of telling you
I was attracted to you.

10:50.518 --> 10:52.360
Funny because it's true?

10:52.361 --> 10:55.030
I wouldn't come on
to someone in bible study.

10:55.031 --> 10:56.525
That would be inappropriate.

10:57.081 --> 10:59.604
Suppose things were different.

10:59.639 --> 11:03.798
Suppose you were on the lady's door step
and she was listening with eager ears.

11:04.041 --> 11:07.382
To a lady I had resolved
to say such things...

11:07.837 --> 11:10.125
Yes, that would be an appropriate time.

11:14.520 --> 11:17.600
So you came here to tell me
you're not attracted to me.

11:18.630 --> 11:21.529
I came here to clear up
any confusion between us.

11:21.730 --> 11:24.759
So there wouldn't be any awkward
moments in front of Dr. Callahan.

11:25.312 --> 11:28.892
So you want to go to the dinner
but not as my date.

11:28.927 --> 11:31.979
I think that would be the
most honest way to do things.

11:32.014 --> 11:34.905
We wouldn't want people to think we
were dating. That would lead to gossip.

11:35.040 --> 11:36.866
Well, what did my uncle say?

11:37.631 --> 11:41.602
Since he was so mistaken
I assume you corrected him?

11:41.946 --> 11:44.569
I thought it would help
if it came from you.

11:44.604 --> 11:48.118
Since speaking to you was how he got
the idea in the first place.

11:48.119 --> 11:51.612
Who knows how he got it
but you've let him run with it now.

11:51.709 --> 11:54.219
He might have told Dr Callahan already.

11:54.278 --> 11:56.633
A slight correction.
I'm sure he won't mind.

11:56.668 --> 12:00.143
You want him to say
that he was wrong?

12:00.658 --> 12:04.495
What an embarrassing thing to say
to a man like Jim Callahan.

12:04.768 --> 12:08.225
If anyone needs to make a confession,
Jacob it's you.

12:08.260 --> 12:10.917
That is an interesting way
to look at it.

12:10.918 --> 12:15.036
You can tell my uncle you don't like me, if
you want, and enjoy your Friday night alone.

12:15.678 --> 12:19.330
- He's not going to uninvite me.
- Don't be so sure.

12:19.794 --> 12:25.207
The other pastors, the married ones,
he invited them weeks ago.

12:26.247 --> 12:30.026
But you could have a seat
at the table now, Jacob.

12:30.347 --> 12:32.407
One night won't kill you.

12:42.586 --> 12:43.943
Can I come in?

12:45.556 --> 12:46.656
What's up?

12:47.626 --> 12:49.567
I don't know quite how to say this, but...

12:49.976 --> 12:53.855
I was wondering if I could
utilize your services.

12:53.856 --> 12:58.191
Not all of your services,
just I need a date.

12:58.572 --> 13:00.858
- For what?
- A dinner party.

13:01.089 --> 13:03.608
I'm paired with someone
I don't want to be with.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.284
So say you're dating someone.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.612
I can't.
I'm a pastor. I don't lie.

13:07.731 --> 13:09.085
Isn't it a lie with me?

13:09.165 --> 13:13.179
No. With you I can say we
have a special relationship.

13:13.267 --> 13:15.705
That's cute.
And a little pathetic.

13:16.765 --> 13:19.825
Maybe, but it will deflect
other questions.

13:20.875 --> 13:23.964
- Who are the players?
- The what?

13:23.965 --> 13:26.014
The other people at the party.

13:26.015 --> 13:28.090
Just the pastors from my church.
And their wives.

13:28.125 --> 13:29.823
That doesn't sound like much of a party.

13:29.824 --> 13:31.812
Why can't you just go with
whoever they paired you with?

13:31.884 --> 13:33.407
Because I don't want to marry her.

13:33.442 --> 13:36.643
- What does that say about me?
- You I can break up with.

13:36.678 --> 13:39.407
I could never break up with her
because she's the pastor's niece.

13:39.688 --> 13:41.703
And if people see us together,
then we're dating.

13:41.704 --> 13:44.569
And if I say we're not
then they hate me.

13:44.604 --> 13:47.383
- Then maybe you should marry her.
- Not gonna happen.

13:47.384 --> 13:50.192
- Why?
- I'm not interested.

13:50.193 --> 13:51.558
- Why? What's wrong with her?
- Nothing.

13:51.593 --> 13:53.982
- Is she fat?
- No, I don't expect you to understand.

13:53.983 --> 13:55.021
Try me.

13:57.063 --> 13:58.690
She's dishonest.

13:59.173 --> 14:01.252
Okay.
So she's fat.

14:01.253 --> 14:05.332
- Look, are you gonna help me or not?
- I don't know. Sounds complicated.

14:05.333 --> 14:07.333
All you have to do is
stand there and look pretty.

14:07.874 --> 14:10.085
Doesn't that sound better
than what you normally do?

14:10.123 --> 14:13.326
Sounds about the same, actually.
Except for the standing.

14:13.482 --> 14:17.038
Then it sounds like you can handle it.
And I'll pay you your normal rate.

14:17.592 --> 14:20.388
- I'm very expensive.
- I'm very desperate.

14:23.145 --> 14:24.403
All right.

14:26.002 --> 14:30.151
Bring me this amount in this
envelope tomorrow and I'll do it.

14:31.020 --> 14:32.153
That's my rate.

14:32.202 --> 14:35.820
- Dare you to find out why.
- I'll take your word for it.

14:39.321 --> 14:41.972
I apologize for the awkward
situation this creates.

14:42.007 --> 14:43.472
But if I were to take Leah

14:43.481 --> 14:45.510
it would create an awkward
situation for me and Rachel.

14:45.511 --> 14:48.106
Okay, but why didn't you say
anything yesterday?

14:48.141 --> 14:51.690
- I wanted to talk with Leah first.
- And how did she take it?

14:51.691 --> 14:53.250
As well as she could, I suppose.

14:53.251 --> 14:55.462
She must have been bothered by the
fact that you want to replace her.

14:55.830 --> 14:58.723
- I didn't tell her about Rachel.
- Why not?

14:58.970 --> 15:00.810
Taking Rachel had not
yet occurred to me.

15:00.830 --> 15:04.019
I wanted to clear up the
confusion with Leah first.

15:04.040 --> 15:06.089
It wasn't until later when I was
speaking with Rachel I realized

15:06.090 --> 15:08.139
how much an evening
with Dr. Callahan might benefit her.

15:08.140 --> 15:11.219
I see.
How long have you two been dating?

15:11.220 --> 15:15.340
I wouldn't say we were dating.
I'd say we have a special relationship.

15:15.974 --> 15:18.438
And you wouldn't feel right
dating someone else?

15:18.439 --> 15:20.508
For the present circumstance
that's correct.

15:20.509 --> 15:23.578
Well that's fine, Jacob, but
you'll have to skip the dinner.

15:23.579 --> 15:25.619
Why?
Aren't all the pastors invited?

15:30.789 --> 15:32.865
I'll have to meet her first.

15:33.859 --> 15:36.878
She does well at social
events if that's your concern.

15:36.879 --> 15:38.989
I've waited thirty years
for this opportunity.

15:39.549 --> 15:42.068
I can't introduce Jim Callahan
to a stranger.

15:44.108 --> 15:46.888
Okay. I'll set something up
for later this week.

15:52.038 --> 15:55.521
- I don't want to talk to a pastor.
- Why not? You talk to me.

15:55.659 --> 15:57.359
Yeah, but you're not a real pastor.

15:58.467 --> 16:00.737
What? Isn't that what you're
always complaining about?

16:00.738 --> 16:02.160
They won't promote you?

16:02.353 --> 16:06.117
Ordain. They won't ordain me.
This dinner could change that.

16:06.187 --> 16:06.602
How?

16:06.637 --> 16:09.425
I know Dr. Callahan's work
better than anybody.

16:09.467 --> 16:11.364
I can convince him to work with us.

16:11.399 --> 16:13.576
And if I do that then Campbell
can't ignore me anymore.

16:13.577 --> 16:16.696
I see. So you want to
size up with the big boys.

16:16.697 --> 16:19.806
Something like that.
But I can't if I'm not there.

16:19.807 --> 16:22.676
This sounds like more work than
standing around looking pretty.

16:22.677 --> 16:25.785
I know.
That's why I doubled your rate.

16:28.856 --> 16:30.523
I'll need more than that.

16:30.822 --> 16:34.019
- I'll give you every cent I have.
- I'm not talking about money.

16:34.186 --> 16:35.206
I need a favor.

16:36.276 --> 16:37.306
Okay, what?

16:38.386 --> 16:39.425
I don't know.

16:39.426 --> 16:41.485
But I want to know you'll be there
for me when the time comes.

16:41.486 --> 16:44.555
I can't promise to do something
if I don't know what it is.

16:44.556 --> 16:45.605
Yes you can.

16:45.606 --> 16:47.694
- There are certain things I won't do.
- Like?

16:47.695 --> 16:50.764
Like I won't violate
my moral principles.

16:50.765 --> 16:54.914
You won't have to whack anybody, okay?
I'm just following Grandpa's advice.

16:54.915 --> 16:56.965
Always take a favor over money.

16:59.045 --> 17:01.804
I don't know, Rachel.
It's a strange request.

17:01.805 --> 17:03.175
So is yours.

17:05.085 --> 17:06.124
Okay.

17:06.125 --> 17:09.204
As long as it doesn't violate
my conscience I'll do it.

17:09.204 --> 17:12.262
And you can't say 'it violates my conscience'
if it's something you just don't want to do.

17:12.516 --> 17:15.270
I wouldn't do that.
I don't lie.

17:16.267 --> 17:17.480
Okay, then.

17:18.473 --> 17:20.523
Let's meet the pastor.

17:28.864 --> 17:31.013
- So what's the question?
- Calm down. I know what to say.

17:31.014 --> 17:33.122
Well prove it.
Repeat it back to me.

17:33.123 --> 17:35.132
I'm starting to understand
why you're single.

17:35.133 --> 17:36.212
Rachel, this is important.

17:36.213 --> 17:38.282
If you ask the right question
he'll do all the talking.

17:38.283 --> 17:40.342
- What if I want to say something?
- You don't.

17:40.343 --> 17:43.402
- You want to ask a question. Which is...
- Is it a sin to marry a goat?

17:43.403 --> 17:44.512
Rachel...

17:44.513 --> 17:48.563
And can you rationalize dispensationalism with
a postmodern non-literal view of the rapture?

17:49.603 --> 17:50.692
That's more like it.

17:51.141 --> 17:53.693
Don't forget...
I'm a professional.

17:55.722 --> 17:57.771
I came home one day and saw
that her apartment door was open.

17:57.772 --> 17:59.811
She had left it open before.

17:59.812 --> 18:03.951
But this time I decided to go over
and recommend that she close it.

18:03.952 --> 18:07.052
- And then she said...
- If it was closed how would we meet?

18:07.625 --> 18:10.066
She always has an
interesting perspective.

18:10.172 --> 18:12.065
It's been to have someone
to talk to after work.

18:12.092 --> 18:14.291
An important discovery, for sure.

18:14.292 --> 18:17.350
- Where are you from, Rachel?
- New Jersey.

18:17.351 --> 18:19.400
I've never been but
I hear about it on the news.

18:19.401 --> 18:21.480
- What brought you to Washington?
- My family.

18:21.481 --> 18:23.530
I had to get as far away
from them as possible.

18:23.531 --> 18:25.610
- Sounds like there's a story there.
- There is.

18:25.611 --> 18:27.660
But she hasn't told me yet so
I assume she won't tell you.

18:27.661 --> 18:29.710
Not until we know each other better.

18:29.711 --> 18:30.780
Well that sounds fair.

18:30.781 --> 18:33.870
I was talking about him.
You I would tell.

18:33.871 --> 18:36.020
- Should we have him leave?
- Would you?

18:36.021 --> 18:37.100
No, thanks.

18:37.101 --> 18:40.189
Well we have to talk about something.
What do you do for work?

18:40.190 --> 18:42.279
- Let's talk about something else.
- Why's that?

18:42.280 --> 18:47.149
Because Rachel has a question.
And I think it is a fascinating one.

18:47.150 --> 18:51.450
Something he couldn't answer, then?
I'd be happy to enlighten you.

18:54.510 --> 18:56.580
What's your question?

18:57.660 --> 18:59.699
Well first I should answer
your original question.

18:59.700 --> 19:00.748
What I do for work.

19:00.749 --> 19:03.818
But the conversation's already
headed in a different direction.

19:03.819 --> 19:05.888
I wouldn't want to be rude
by not answering.

19:05.889 --> 19:07.968
It wouldn't be rude.

19:07.969 --> 19:10.048
We all just want to
have a nice chat here.

19:10.049 --> 19:12.118
And I think your question
is very interesting.

19:12.119 --> 19:16.986
I'm starting to think that my work might lead
to a better conversation than my question.

19:17.209 --> 19:20.309
Bit of advice, Jacob.
Always let a lady speak her mind.

19:21.329 --> 19:25.438
What Jacob doesn't want you to
know is that I make my living as...

19:27.478 --> 19:29.557
- An actress.
- An actress?

19:29.558 --> 19:33.627
Well that's wonderful.
Why wouldn't you want me to know that?

19:33.628 --> 19:37.747
The church hasn't always been kind to
actresses. He didn't know how you'd take it.

19:37.748 --> 19:40.887
Then he doesn't know me well enough.
I think drama is a beautiful art form.

19:40.888 --> 19:43.608
My wife and I often go to the
Shakespeare in the park in the summer.

19:44.028 --> 19:47.117
- I've performed in the park.
- I read Hamlet once in college.

19:48.207 --> 19:50.266
That play has some
interesting spiritual themes.

19:50.267 --> 19:52.416
- Don't you think?
- It sure does, Jacob.

19:52.417 --> 19:54.436
You must be a good actress
to make a living at it.

19:54.437 --> 19:55.486
Oh, yes.

19:55.487 --> 19:57.596
- I'm in high demand.
- Have you done any films?

19:57.597 --> 20:00.686
- Only for the Internet.
- Interesting.

20:00.687 --> 20:02.726
I've heard that's a thing now.

20:02.727 --> 20:04.766
I'm too old fashioned to
watch movies with a computer.

20:04.767 --> 20:06.906
- Have you seen them?
- No.

20:06.907 --> 20:09.955
I like her better when
she's not putting on a show.

20:09.956 --> 20:13.035
I keep telling him what he's
missing out on but he won't listen.

20:13.036 --> 20:15.095
That's impressive.

20:15.096 --> 20:18.165
There are lot's of ladies all across the world
who wish they could do what you do.

20:18.166 --> 20:21.215
They already have all they need.
They just have to learn how to use it.

20:21.216 --> 20:23.255
Could you teach the ladies
at our church?

20:23.256 --> 20:24.295
That won't be necessary.

20:24.296 --> 20:26.326
Like she said,
they already have all they need.

20:27.346 --> 20:30.394
Spoken like someone who did not
see last year's Christmas play.

20:30.395 --> 20:33.465
I would love any advice you could
give on performing in the church.

20:38.605 --> 20:40.674
I didn't want you to lie to him.

20:40.675 --> 20:42.744
- I didn't.
- You told him you're an actress.

20:42.745 --> 20:45.794
If you don't think that's true then there
are parts of my job you don't understand.

20:45.795 --> 20:50.974
- All you had to do was ask the question.
- Inspiration struck.

20:50.975 --> 20:53.994
And you're overlooking the fact
that I completely charmed him.

20:55.064 --> 20:57.084
Yes, but...

20:58.124 --> 21:00.204
It's important to me
that we do this honestly.

21:06.294 --> 21:09.344
Okay.
I'll be good.

21:23.613 --> 21:25.672
Hello, Jacob.

21:25.673 --> 21:29.742
- I've got good news.
- You're leaving God for me?

21:29.743 --> 21:32.822
No, good news.
We're on for the dinner.

21:32.823 --> 21:34.902
Pastor Campbell just gave me
the word this afternoon.

21:34.903 --> 21:36.962
Aren't you glad I did the talking?

21:37.992 --> 21:39.051
Pastor Campbell was glad.

21:39.052 --> 21:41.121
He recommended
you do the same on Friday.

21:41.122 --> 21:45.212
It'll be hard to top
my last performance but I'll try.

21:46.252 --> 21:49.362
- Anyway, I just came by to say thanks.
- Hey.

21:51.402 --> 21:53.461
- You owe me a favor.
- I know.

21:53.462 --> 21:55.511
- Are you gonna deliver?
- Of course.

21:55.512 --> 21:57.601
Why?
Do you need something?

21:57.602 --> 21:59.650
Yes. And I'd like to remind you
that you already agreed to it.

21:59.651 --> 22:00.700
I know.

22:00.701 --> 22:02.770
- So me asking is just a formality.
- Okay.

22:02.807 --> 22:04.730
- Because you're gonna do it.
- What am I gonna do?

22:04.731 --> 22:05.911
You're gonna sleep with me.

22:15.121 --> 22:18.250
- You know I can't do that.
- I don't mean sex.

22:18.251 --> 22:19.330
I just mean sleep in
the same bed with me.

22:19.331 --> 22:22.389
- Why?
- Because I can't sleep alone.

22:22.390 --> 22:24.439
Ever since my boyfriend broke up with me
I haven't slept through the night.

22:24.440 --> 22:26.529
And if I don't sleep soon I'll die.

22:26.530 --> 22:29.610
- Try warm milk.
- I need a warm body.

22:30.730 --> 22:33.790
I'm not supposed to be in any situation
where there might be temptation.

22:34.830 --> 22:35.879
There won't be.

22:35.880 --> 22:37.909
I know your rules. That's why
you're the only one who can help.

22:37.910 --> 22:41.019
I don't know, Rachel.
I don't think I can.

22:41.020 --> 22:44.228
- You said you'd do me a favor.
- If it didn't violate my conscience.

22:44.229 --> 22:46.308
How is this any different
than what you're asking of me?

22:46.309 --> 22:48.348
You need me to just stand there
I need you to just lay there.

22:48.349 --> 22:50.348
Yes, but if we sleep together

22:50.349 --> 22:53.388
people will think what people think
about people who sleep together.

22:53.389 --> 22:55.468
No one will know.

22:55.469 --> 22:57.558
- I would need your word on that.
- Want me to sign something?

22:57.559 --> 23:00.638
- Wouldn't be the first time.
- No, nothing that could be traced.

23:00.639 --> 23:01.888
It wouldn't get back to you.

23:01.889 --> 23:03.646
It's not like we have
the same circle of friends.

23:04.100 --> 23:07.459
Mrs. Jenkins in apartment 10.
She knows all the ladies at my church.

23:07.508 --> 23:09.428
If she found out not only
would I not be ordained

23:09.448 --> 23:11.671
I would be kicked out of
the ministry all together.

23:11.708 --> 23:14.624
- Because we slept in the same bed?
- They'd never believe that's all we did.

23:14.988 --> 23:17.228
Well that sounds like a situation
you'll have to manage.

23:18.118 --> 23:20.148
Not something that will violate
your conscience.

23:21.208 --> 23:25.308
- Would you need cuddling?
- No. Not required.

23:26.368 --> 23:28.436
That would have to be a rule.
No touching.

23:28.437 --> 23:29.677
Like sleeping with your sister.

23:32.557 --> 23:34.626
I don't know, Rachel.

23:34.627 --> 23:35.907
I have to think about it.

23:36.657 --> 23:37.766
Fine.

23:38.215 --> 23:41.397
But if you're a man of your word
you'll be here at 10.

23:41.437 --> 23:42.987
With your jammies on.

24:18.635 --> 24:21.335
Nope. No, there's no way.

24:40.934 --> 24:42.974
Shut the door. Quick!

24:43.534 --> 24:46.132
I thought I saw Mrs. Jenkins.
Since when do you lock your door?

24:46.709 --> 24:49.062
Seemed like a night
for trying new things.

24:51.945 --> 24:54.949
I need another minute
but make yourself at home.

25:06.633 --> 25:08.663
What side of the bed do you want me on?

25:09.723 --> 25:10.833
The right.

25:16.743 --> 25:18.863
Right facing the bed
or laying on the bed.

25:20.792 --> 25:22.922
Laying on your back or your stomach?

25:25.032 --> 25:27.052
On my back. If I'm on my
stomach they're the same.

25:28.092 --> 25:30.192
I know. That's why I asked.

25:32.232 --> 25:35.342
- So which is it?
- Just lay down wherever you want.

25:42.421 --> 25:44.471
I'm gonna take the right side.

25:53.721 --> 25:56.771
- What time do you usually get up?
- When I'm in the mood.

25:58.841 --> 26:01.970
Whoa, Rachel.
What are you wearing?

26:02.071 --> 26:03.378
My jammies.

26:04.020 --> 26:06.049
Those don't look like jammies.

26:06.050 --> 26:07.881
Not what your sister would wear?

26:08.090 --> 26:11.812
I'd appreciate it if you could put on
something a little more appropriate.

26:12.080 --> 26:14.219
I'd appreciate it if you didn't
tell me what to wear in my own home.

26:14.220 --> 26:18.319
Perhaps I should remind you
that I'm not just a guest.

26:18.320 --> 26:19.349
I am doing you a favor.

26:19.350 --> 26:23.480
I never agreed to wear what you want.
I charge extra for that.

26:31.249 --> 26:32.719
Hey there.

26:34.469 --> 26:38.045
I'm just gonna close my eyes.
Until you turn off the lights. Okay?

26:38.119 --> 26:39.441
You don't need my permission.

26:39.539 --> 26:42.345
I'm just letting you know in case
you wondered what I was doing.

26:42.380 --> 26:46.178
- I didn't wonder what so much as why.
- I must stay above reproach.

26:46.279 --> 26:49.037
- Or your eyeballs will fall out?
- Yes.

26:49.038 --> 26:51.047
And then you'd have to put them back in.

26:51.048 --> 26:53.108
Because I'd have difficulty seeing.

26:56.238 --> 26:59.367
- What?
- Nothing. Just... hold still.

26:59.368 --> 27:01.387
Rachel...
What are you doing?

27:01.388 --> 27:03.558
Relax.
I'm not gonna touch you.

27:04.628 --> 27:06.647
I could have handed it to you.

27:06.648 --> 27:08.707
You'd have spilled it
all over the place.

27:08.989 --> 27:12.767
- You know I wouldn't have.
- With your eyes closed?

27:13.837 --> 27:16.906
Well just hand it to me
and I'll put it back.

27:16.907 --> 27:17.976
You don't know where it goes.

27:17.977 --> 27:19.006
What's it matter?

27:19.007 --> 27:21.036
If it's in the wrong place
it will spill.

27:21.037 --> 27:24.116
Well then I'll get out,
and then you can... put it back.

27:24.117 --> 27:25.187
Too late.

27:28.007 --> 27:30.918
- What now?
- This picture isn't straight.

27:30.926 --> 27:35.158
- And you have to straighten it just now?
- Yes. Or it will bother me all night.

27:35.307 --> 27:36.922
I'm closing my eyes again.

27:37.546 --> 27:38.616
Okay...

27:39.956 --> 27:41.696
I think I've got it.

27:47.816 --> 27:49.885
- Jacob?
- What?

27:50.327 --> 27:53.222
Will you take a look for me?
I'm not sure I've got it right.

27:58.025 --> 27:59.095
How's the view?

28:06.656 --> 28:10.315
Yeah.
It looks... Straight.

28:15.425 --> 28:17.494
Thank you for doing this.

28:18.613 --> 28:20.283
I feel better already.

28:24.484 --> 28:26.469
Just remember...

28:27.384 --> 28:28.723
I'm not doing anything.

28:33.162 --> 28:34.822
Can we turn off the light now?

28:43.762 --> 28:45.153
Good night, Rachel.

28:46.193 --> 28:47.804
Good night, Jacob.

29:10.991 --> 29:12.822
- Rachel?
- Yeah?

29:14.207 --> 29:17.151
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

29:26.181 --> 29:28.221
It sounds like you're doing something.

29:32.231 --> 29:34.391
There. All done.

29:36.431 --> 29:40.040
- What did you do?
- I told you. Nothing.

29:40.044 --> 29:42.671
- It didn't sound like nothing.
- What did it sound like?

29:44.741 --> 29:46.790
Like something.

29:48.984 --> 29:52.900
If you must know...
I took off my jammies.

29:53.136 --> 29:54.211
What?

29:54.800 --> 29:56.285
But, you're not...

29:56.840 --> 29:57.788
Naked?

29:59.080 --> 30:01.421
Yes, I'm naked.

30:01.456 --> 30:03.169
Okay, Rachel.

30:03.170 --> 30:05.249
- Put your jammies back on.
- I sleep better this way.

30:05.250 --> 30:07.349
- This is too much.
- It's better for body heat.

30:07.350 --> 30:09.211
- You should strip, too, actually.
- I will not.

30:09.239 --> 30:11.996
And I will not sleep in the same bed
with you while you are naked.

30:12.039 --> 30:13.156
I thought we had a deal.

30:13.199 --> 30:15.341
You never said anything
about sleeping naked.

30:15.439 --> 30:18.562
- I know the rules. I won't touch you.
- Yes, but you're naked.

30:18.597 --> 30:19.898
I'm under the covers.
What's the difference?

30:19.899 --> 30:21.938
The difference is you're naked.

30:21.939 --> 30:23.948
Are you thinking about
what I look like under here?

30:24.831 --> 30:26.073
What?

30:26.108 --> 30:28.058
Does knowing I'm naked
make you picture me naked?

30:28.059 --> 30:29.508
Stop that.

30:29.509 --> 30:31.837
Or maybe you've already thought
about it but now it's real.

30:31.838 --> 30:33.228
I will leave if you
keep talking this way.

30:33.368 --> 30:35.539
Tell me you've never pictured me
naked and I'll stop.

30:36.278 --> 30:38.112
You're doing it right now, aren't you?

30:38.713 --> 30:41.257
- Good night, Rachel.
- If you leave I won't go to the dinner.

30:43.338 --> 30:45.587
Rachel, I am very
uncomfortable with this.

30:45.588 --> 30:49.013
Can you please just put
your jammies back on?

30:49.718 --> 30:51.808
I will if you answer one question.

30:52.867 --> 30:53.936
Fine.

30:53.937 --> 30:55.996
And you have to promise you'll answer.
No deflecting.

30:55.997 --> 30:57.096
I promise. What's the question?

30:57.097 --> 31:00.499
Do you stop by to see any
other neighbors or just me?

31:03.247 --> 31:05.296
- Why do you ask?
- You're deflecting.

31:05.297 --> 31:08.473
- No, I'm asking for context.
- You don't need it. Answer the question.

31:10.527 --> 31:11.577
Just you.

31:18.496 --> 31:19.795
Why just me?

31:20.646 --> 31:22.928
Is it because you find me attractive?

31:22.963 --> 31:24.416
Why is this so important to you?

31:24.484 --> 31:27.758
Because I think you should admit you
don't stop by just to be a good neighbor.

31:28.907 --> 31:32.026
I am trying to be
a good neighbor, I just...

31:34.086 --> 31:36.126
...also happen to find you attractive.

31:51.455 --> 31:52.495
What?

31:53.575 --> 31:55.569
You're attracted to me.

31:56.745 --> 31:58.795
I imagine I'm not the first.

32:00.854 --> 32:04.963
Yeah, but with you, somehow...

32:04.964 --> 32:06.984
it's exciting.

32:08.750 --> 32:10.249
Like it used to be.

32:19.234 --> 32:21.284
Good night, Rachel.

32:36.963 --> 32:38.793
Good night, Jacob.

32:45.398 --> 32:46.730
Jacob?

32:48.092 --> 32:49.132
What?

32:49.603 --> 32:51.428
Are you a virgin?

32:54.279 --> 32:57.501
I'm starting to think we should
have added 'no talking' to the rules.

32:57.502 --> 32:58.944
Come on.

32:59.042 --> 33:01.617
A little pillow talk never hurt anyone.

33:02.432 --> 33:03.682
Are you?

33:11.581 --> 33:13.191
Yes. I'm a virgin.

33:15.646 --> 33:16.926
How old are you?

33:18.141 --> 33:20.294
Older than most virgins.

33:20.954 --> 33:23.715
Is it by choice or lack of opportunity?

33:25.321 --> 33:26.410
Both.

33:26.411 --> 33:29.289
What if someone offered?
What would you do?

33:29.490 --> 33:31.579
- Say no.
- Are you sure?

33:31.580 --> 33:32.610
Yes.

33:33.650 --> 33:35.710
What if you found her very attractive?

33:38.800 --> 33:39.850
Good night, Rachel.

33:40.910 --> 33:41.989
Come on...

33:41.990 --> 33:45.079
You'll never get any sleep
if you talk all night.

33:45.080 --> 33:49.230
- Or if I have unanswered questions.
- Then ask different questions.

33:51.239 --> 33:53.259
Have you ever been in love?

33:57.329 --> 33:59.409
Yes.

34:01.429 --> 34:03.489
What happened?

34:04.569 --> 34:06.649
- It didn't work out.
- Why?

34:09.799 --> 34:11.879
She didn't want to be a pastor's wife.

34:13.958 --> 34:14.820
I see.

34:17.668 --> 34:19.009
Would you marry me?

34:20.547 --> 34:21.675
What?

34:22.228 --> 34:23.487
Would you marry me?

34:24.328 --> 34:28.027
- Are you proposing?
- Yes. What do you say?

34:28.027 --> 34:30.447
I think you just want
to know what I would say.

34:30.447 --> 34:32.185
That's correct.
What do you say?

34:34.547 --> 34:37.123
- I'd consider it.
- Consider it now.

34:40.128 --> 34:42.326
You'd have to give
your life to the Lord.

34:42.746 --> 34:44.846
Why should I convert?
Why can't you convert?

34:44.847 --> 34:48.429
- To what? You don't believe in anything.
- Yes. Convert to that.

34:50.286 --> 34:52.047
I'd be lying.
Is that what you want?

34:57.507 --> 34:59.226
You wouldn't marry me.

35:01.286 --> 35:03.346
- Why?
- Cause I've done things.

35:05.786 --> 35:09.556
- If the Lord can forgive, so can I.
- You wouldn't forgive if you knew.

35:10.506 --> 35:13.470
- Try me.
- You want me to confess?

35:13.505 --> 35:14.746
It might help you sleep.

35:16.406 --> 35:18.653
All right.
But only if you go first.

35:18.866 --> 35:20.924
I feel like I've confessed
a lot already.

35:20.925 --> 35:22.954
Not compared to what I've got.

35:22.955 --> 35:25.015
Tell me the worst thing
you've ever done.

35:27.488 --> 35:29.600
Wait, no.
You'll say something boring.

35:29.975 --> 35:33.086
Tell me about the farthest
you've ever gone with a girl.

35:33.165 --> 35:35.055
I want the whole story.

35:42.127 --> 35:43.448
What's the matter?

35:45.370 --> 35:47.019
I'm waiting for the story.

35:49.664 --> 35:50.694
Unless...

35:51.744 --> 35:53.794
...is it happening right now?

36:00.794 --> 36:03.719
- Rachel, why did you want me here?
- To get some sleep.

36:04.144 --> 36:06.152
Well you've made no progress
on that front.

36:06.153 --> 36:08.032
And I'm starting to think
that's not what you want.

36:08.033 --> 36:09.932
Okay, then. What do I want?

36:10.253 --> 36:12.102
You want to seduce me.

36:12.103 --> 36:14.857
Why does every man I talk to
think I'm trying to seduce him?

36:14.892 --> 36:18.322
There's talk and then there's talk.
But it's not gonna happen.

36:18.323 --> 36:20.493
Then why are you so afraid it will?

36:21.523 --> 36:22.837
I'm leaving.

36:23.873 --> 36:26.232
- You said you'd do me a favor.
- Not that kind of favor.

36:26.233 --> 36:27.271
You seriously think
that's what I'm after?

36:27.272 --> 36:28.301
Like I don't have enough
of that in my life?

36:28.302 --> 36:31.411
You expect me to believe that after all
this you just want to sleep?

36:31.412 --> 36:34.279
- I'll admit there is more to it than that.
- Which is why I'm leaving.

36:34.302 --> 36:35.531
It was dumb of me to believe you
in the first place.

36:35.532 --> 36:37.581
You believed me because
you wanted to sleep with me.

36:37.582 --> 36:39.621
Maybe I teased you for it
more than I should have.

36:39.622 --> 36:40.681
But I need you to stay.

36:40.682 --> 36:44.451
No, you need a lot of things but a
man in your bed is not one of them.

36:44.452 --> 36:47.917
- Honestly, Jacob. I need you to stay.
- Rachel, stop lying.

36:53.751 --> 36:57.685
We'll reassess our arrangement
in the morning. Good night.

36:58.191 --> 36:59.240
Wait, Jacob. There's something
you need to know.

36:59.241 --> 37:00.321
Tell me tomorrow.

37:08.501 --> 37:09.806
Rachel? You there?

37:11.570 --> 37:12.590
Who is that?

37:14.400 --> 37:15.858
Ask him yourself.

37:15.893 --> 37:18.235
Come on, Rachel.
I know this is your place.

37:18.830 --> 37:19.879
Tell him to go away.

37:19.880 --> 37:21.989
- Why do I have to talk to him?
- Cause it will scare him.

37:21.990 --> 37:24.039
Just tell him to leave.
What's he gonna do?

37:24.040 --> 37:25.141
Break down the door?

37:26.100 --> 37:27.735
He's gonna break down the door?!

37:27.770 --> 37:30.239
Not if he goes away. Just yell at him.
Tell him you're my boyfriend.

37:30.240 --> 37:31.319
I am not your boyfriend.

37:31.320 --> 37:33.378
Just say something.
And be firm about it.

37:33.379 --> 37:35.249
Mrs. Jenkins might hear.

37:35.850 --> 37:39.086
Just ignore him.
He'll go away eventually.

37:39.119 --> 37:41.053
I'm not leaving till we talk.

37:47.469 --> 37:48.936
I don't want to talk to you, Phil.

37:49.116 --> 37:52.379
Hey, you acknowledge I'm
alive. This is progress.

37:52.414 --> 37:53.868
- You're dead to me.
- Nope.

37:53.869 --> 37:55.229
Alive right here on your doorstep.

37:55.968 --> 37:58.017
You should have known I'd find you.

37:58.018 --> 38:00.594
I didn't answer your calls. That
meant I didn't want to talk to you.

38:00.668 --> 38:03.529
Well I can't accept that.
Not after the way you left things.

38:03.564 --> 38:05.355
Doesn't matter now.
I'm with someone else.

38:06.048 --> 38:08.307
He's with me right now.
We're sleeping together.

38:08.308 --> 38:09.317
Leave me out of this.

38:09.318 --> 38:10.388
Did you hear that?

38:11.438 --> 38:12.458
Yeah, he's awful quiet.

38:13.508 --> 38:15.538
But I guess imaginary
friends usually are.

38:16.608 --> 38:18.646
He will leave if he
thinks I'm with someone.

38:18.647 --> 38:20.667
Just let him know you're here.

38:23.625 --> 38:24.757
Hey, Phil.

38:25.797 --> 38:28.876
What's up dude?
You havin' a good time in there?

38:28.877 --> 38:31.956
Well enjoy it while you can
before she ruins your life!

38:31.957 --> 38:35.086
Listen...
Phil, Rachel doesn't want to see you.

38:35.087 --> 38:38.187
So you should just leave.

38:39.247 --> 38:42.335
Well if she doesn't want
to see me then sure I'll go.

38:42.336 --> 38:45.405
It's all about her, right?
Doesn't matter what I want, does it?!

38:45.406 --> 38:48.445
I'm just her little plaything.
No need to worry about me!

38:48.446 --> 38:50.495
Keep your voice down.
You'll disturb the neighbors.

38:50.496 --> 38:54.575
You want me to calm down?
Fine. Just open that door.

38:54.576 --> 38:55.615
And we'll have a nice little chat.

38:55.616 --> 38:58.725
- How are you in a fist fight?
- I am not getting in a fist fight.

38:58.726 --> 39:01.845
- You can take him. He's probably drunk.
- I can't let anyone see me here.

39:01.846 --> 39:04.944
You think he's gonna tell the church?
Believe me, he does not go to church.

39:04.945 --> 39:07.462
You said no one would find out.
No one.

39:07.519 --> 39:09.939
Now what's all this racket?

39:10.025 --> 39:11.194
Nothing to worry about here, ma'am.

39:11.195 --> 39:13.254
Well I know there's
nothing to worry about.

39:13.255 --> 39:15.314
Not while the Lord Jesus
is on the throne.

39:15.315 --> 39:16.354
Mrs. Jenkins.

39:16.355 --> 39:20.494
It's you who sound worried.
Hollering like a crazy person.

39:20.495 --> 39:23.098
You wouldn't think I was a crazy person
if you knew what she put me through.

39:23.125 --> 39:24.776
- Rachel?
- You know her?

39:24.811 --> 39:27.733
I've been praying for her.
She needs the Lord.

39:27.734 --> 39:28.763
I'll say.

39:28.764 --> 39:31.863
What about you?
Do you know the Lord?

39:31.864 --> 39:33.903
Not in the biblical sense, no.

39:33.904 --> 39:36.954
Then maybe you should spend
some time with Pastor Jacob, too.

39:37.994 --> 39:39.033
Pastor Jacob?

39:39.034 --> 39:43.173
He's that handsome young man
that's been sharing the gospel with her.

39:43.174 --> 39:45.234
He gives it to her every night.

39:47.193 --> 39:51.352
- Is that so, pastor?
- What are you doing?

39:51.353 --> 39:53.402
You've been mighty quiet
since your friend showed up.

39:53.403 --> 39:54.732
Maybe there's something
you don't want her to know?

39:54.733 --> 39:55.651
Just say you're not him.

39:55.693 --> 39:59.050
Pastor Jacob's not in there.
He's in his apartment.

39:59.085 --> 40:00.412
I wouldn't be too sure.

40:00.413 --> 40:04.702
Every night before bed he's in there
praying for those that need the Lord.

40:04.703 --> 40:07.742
Like I was before
somebody disturbed me.

40:07.743 --> 40:10.771
I wouldn't be yelling if someone
wasn't sleeping with a pastor!

40:10.772 --> 40:13.711
How dare you say that
about Pastor Jacob!

40:13.712 --> 40:15.881
I'm gonna show you
where he is right now.

40:15.882 --> 40:18.971
- Hey, Phil?
- Yeah, dude?

40:18.972 --> 40:21.521
I'm comin' outside.
Just give me a minute.

40:21.812 --> 40:22.981
Why do you need a minute?

40:22.982 --> 40:25.741
Because I'm going outside through your
bathroom window. And you're coming with me.

40:25.742 --> 40:27.885
- Why?
- I can't leave you alone with him.

40:27.900 --> 40:29.402
Then don't. Confront him.

40:30.210 --> 40:32.077
How would I explain
that to Mrs. Jenkins?

40:32.858 --> 40:33.826
Come on.

40:38.134 --> 40:39.260
I'll need a boost.

40:39.791 --> 40:41.850
- What?
- We said no touching.

40:41.851 --> 40:42.891
Seriously?

40:43.991 --> 40:45.961
You can do it. I believe in you.

40:51.291 --> 40:53.094
- What's the matter?
- I'm stuck.

40:53.131 --> 40:54.511
Just pull yourself through.

40:55.470 --> 40:57.549
You're the one who wanted
to get out this way. Just help me.

40:57.550 --> 40:59.630
- I can't.
- Yes you can. This hurts.

41:00.670 --> 41:02.592
Just come back down.
We'll figure something else out.

41:02.610 --> 41:05.197
That'll hurt, too. Will you get
over yourself and just help me?

41:06.880 --> 41:07.940
Okay...

41:08.990 --> 41:11.039
If she needs help then
it's not against the rules.

41:11.040 --> 41:12.090
Okay...

41:23.872 --> 41:27.778
- You literally left me hanging.
- Well it was a difficult situation.

41:27.779 --> 41:29.495
Yeah.
For me.

41:38.768 --> 41:41.333
Let's go, pastor.
I don't have all night.

41:41.428 --> 41:43.092
And neither do I.

41:43.168 --> 41:47.527
I'm gonna take you to Pastor Jacob
right now and put a stop to these lies.

41:47.528 --> 41:48.587
We gotta move.

41:49.319 --> 41:51.667
You hear that, pastor?
We're going to your place.

41:51.668 --> 41:54.684
Your friend's gonna be awful disappointed
when she doesn't find you there!

42:13.197 --> 42:14.849
Mrs. Jenkins.

42:14.925 --> 42:17.581
You see? I told you he'd be here.

42:19.226 --> 42:22.432
- Who's your friend?
- I don't know his name.

42:22.576 --> 42:24.595
I just know he needs the Lord.

42:25.227 --> 42:28.865
- How long have you been here?
- Why would you need to know that?

42:28.866 --> 42:32.555
He's all mixed up.
Thought you were in Rachel's apartment.

42:32.556 --> 42:34.776
Yeah. Were you?

42:36.816 --> 42:39.885
I was there earlier.
But I'm here now.

42:39.886 --> 42:43.005
- When was earlier?
- Why? What's the matter?

42:43.006 --> 42:45.806
Well I was just talking to her and
she had some guy in there with her.

42:48.595 --> 42:52.694
Well whoever it is there's
gonna be trouble for him.

42:52.695 --> 42:54.724
Cause she's mine, all right?
I'm not lettin' her go.

42:54.725 --> 42:56.785
And does she feel the same?

42:58.615 --> 42:59.940
She did once.

43:00.875 --> 43:04.925
Well, if she doesn't now
you should leave her alone.

43:05.985 --> 43:10.084
What makes you think you're
such an expert on what I should do?

43:11.124 --> 43:13.324
Have you accepted Jesus Christ
as your personal savior?

43:14.204 --> 43:15.263
What?

43:15.264 --> 43:18.394
Cause if you haven't I would
love to share the Gospel with you.

43:19.264 --> 43:20.523
I'm okay.

43:20.524 --> 43:22.357
It will only take a few hours.

43:22.443 --> 43:24.653
You see, in the beginning,
God created man.

43:24.654 --> 43:26.663
And man rebelled against Him.

43:26.664 --> 43:28.724
Look, thanks anyways, all right?

43:29.743 --> 43:30.803
I gotta go.

43:38.963 --> 43:40.885
That man needs the Lord.

43:41.253 --> 43:45.797
Imagine the nerve. Accusing you
of sleeping with Rachel.

43:48.373 --> 43:50.413
That's absurd, right?

43:54.512 --> 43:57.572
Jacob, you aren't
sleeping with her, are you?

43:59.502 --> 44:00.742
Mrs. Jenkins...

44:01.612 --> 44:06.515
One time when Rachel needed
help I gave her a boost.

44:06.882 --> 44:08.912
And that is the only time
we've ever touched.

44:10.320 --> 44:13.095
That's the way to do it, Pastor.

44:13.096 --> 44:16.071
You save yourself
for somebody special.

44:24.041 --> 44:25.270
Seriously?

44:25.271 --> 44:26.320
What?

44:26.321 --> 44:28.390
You couldn't just say
'no, we're not sleeping together'?

44:28.391 --> 44:30.450
That would have been a lie.

44:30.451 --> 44:33.530
You have to lie at some point, Jacob.
We all do.

44:33.531 --> 44:34.601
God always provides a way.

44:37.750 --> 44:38.770
Got anything to drink?

44:39.830 --> 44:40.870
Yeah.

44:41.970 --> 44:43.020
Tea.

44:45.610 --> 44:49.085
- I have to apologize.
- For not having anything stronger?

44:49.230 --> 44:50.995
I don't forgive you.

44:51.741 --> 44:53.147
For not listening.

44:54.410 --> 44:56.770
You were trying to tell me
about Phil earlier. Weren't you?

44:58.309 --> 45:00.214
I was trying to get you to stay.

45:00.559 --> 45:02.619
Why didn't you say anything before?

45:04.510 --> 45:07.924
I wasn't sure he'd be there.
I just heard he was after me.

45:09.393 --> 45:10.829
Is he dangerous?

45:11.524 --> 45:12.918
Probably.

45:12.919 --> 45:17.029
- Have you called the police?
- No. That would be more dangerous.

45:19.069 --> 45:21.109
What would have happened
tonight if I wasn't there?

45:23.168 --> 45:24.376
I don't know.

45:24.418 --> 45:27.248
He probably would have had
his way with me.

45:28.288 --> 45:30.328
Wouldn't be the first time.

45:31.368 --> 45:34.119
I wish you'd get away
from all that, Rachel.

45:35.168 --> 45:37.227
You shouldn't have to live
in fear of guys like him.

45:37.228 --> 45:40.547
- Secretary's have guys like him.
- You don't have to be a secretary.

45:40.548 --> 45:43.086
Just something else.

45:43.120 --> 45:46.217
Anything would be safer
than what you're doing right now.

45:48.767 --> 45:50.817
What about a pastor's wife?

45:51.867 --> 45:54.946
- What?
- That job's available, isn't it?

45:54.947 --> 45:57.047
What's a pastor's wife do?

46:00.177 --> 46:02.256
She talks to the people the
pastor doesn't want to talk to.

46:02.257 --> 46:05.316
And listens to things
he can't tell anybody else.

46:08.396 --> 46:09.416
I could do that.

46:11.536 --> 46:13.576
I bet you could.

46:18.736 --> 46:19.775
Well...

46:19.776 --> 46:21.805
I should go.

46:21.806 --> 46:23.846
What about Phil?

46:25.886 --> 46:28.985
He'll probably have
another drink and pass out.

46:30.045 --> 46:34.095
Or come back more belligerent.
You should stay here.

46:35.165 --> 46:37.205
Take my bed.
I'll sleep on the couch.

46:39.255 --> 46:41.294
I can't make you sleep on
the couch in your own home.

46:41.295 --> 46:43.355
You're not making me.

46:45.505 --> 46:46.525
No.

46:47.605 --> 46:49.684
I've bothered you enough.

46:50.704 --> 46:52.794
It is sweet of you to offer, though.

46:53.844 --> 46:57.275
I suppose we could share the bed.

46:59.924 --> 47:01.447
You know, like we planned.

47:03.104 --> 47:05.124
Are you sure you're okay with that?

47:06.214 --> 47:07.253
Yeah.

47:07.254 --> 47:09.314
I was before.
Why wouldn't I be now?

47:50.084 --> 47:51.452
Good night, Rachel.

47:53.542 --> 47:55.154
Good night, Jacob.

48:03.851 --> 48:07.971
- What?
- There's something in your hair.

48:08.991 --> 48:11.080
- Did I get it?
- No.

48:11.081 --> 48:12.931
- What is it?
- I don't know.

48:14.941 --> 48:16.261
Can I?

48:18.321 --> 48:19.360
Sure.

48:56.680 --> 48:57.836
Rachel...

48:57.999 --> 49:02.078
I am so sorry.
I don't know what came over me.

49:02.079 --> 49:03.138
I'll go.

49:05.238 --> 49:06.308
Wait.

49:20.983 --> 49:23.768
Promise me no more touching.
No more talking.

49:28.947 --> 49:29.987
I promise.

50:33.634 --> 50:34.894
How'd you sleep?

50:38.064 --> 50:39.094
Quite well.

50:45.264 --> 50:49.364
- Don't let Mrs. Jenkins see you, okay?
- She won't. She watches TV all morning.

50:50.424 --> 50:52.463
Don't let any of the other
neighbors see you, either.

50:52.464 --> 50:53.513
Right.

50:53.514 --> 50:55.573
Wouldn't want them
being too proud of you.

50:56.633 --> 50:59.773
- Be ready at six tonight, okay?
- Looking forward to it.

51:17.292 --> 51:20.382
- Would you like some coffee?
- Sure.

51:31.682 --> 51:33.712
So what brings you by?

51:34.772 --> 51:36.822
There was something
that I wanted to discuss.

51:37.892 --> 51:40.950
But now it seems we have
to discuss something else.

51:40.951 --> 51:43.010
It's not what it looks like.

51:43.011 --> 51:46.060
Are you gonna try and tell me
she didn't spend the night?

51:46.061 --> 51:47.131
Nothing happened.

51:48.171 --> 51:53.270
Did she sleep on the couch?
With no blankets or sheets?

51:53.271 --> 51:57.380
- We did not have sex. I swear.
- Well, Jacob...

51:57.381 --> 51:59.471
This does change my opinion of you.

52:00.501 --> 52:02.549
I know we all sin from
time to time. But this?

52:02.550 --> 52:05.619
- Leah, listen to me...
- You know, I cam here to apologize.

52:05.620 --> 52:09.709
My uncle was upset with me and
said not to come to the dinner.

52:09.710 --> 52:13.289
So I thought if I asked forgiveness
you could tell him it was resolved

52:13.290 --> 52:14.696
and we'd all have a good time.

52:15.484 --> 52:18.120
I don't think I want
your forgiveness now.

52:18.155 --> 52:19.939
I don't think I need it.

52:19.940 --> 52:21.989
Okay, I can see why you are upset.

52:21.990 --> 52:24.460
Which is why you need to
speak with Rachel right now.

52:24.495 --> 52:26.188
She can confirm everything.
And then...

52:26.189 --> 52:29.437
You don't have to be upset anymore.

52:30.319 --> 52:32.379
So it's me you're concerned about?

52:33.690 --> 52:35.921
You're the one with something to lose.

52:36.228 --> 52:39.749
If I tell my uncle about this
he'll fire you.

52:39.907 --> 52:41.228
I don't doubt it.

52:41.299 --> 52:43.248
It would be hard to continue
in ministry after that.

52:43.250 --> 52:45.387
I could go back to Uganda.

52:45.478 --> 52:49.275
- But it's not what you want, is it?
- I wouldn't have come back if it was.

52:51.648 --> 52:53.898
Well, I can keep this from my uncle.

52:57.018 --> 52:59.088
If you'll give something in return.

53:00.148 --> 53:01.197
What?

53:01.198 --> 53:04.267
- Dump the harlot.
- Don't you dare call her that.

53:04.268 --> 53:06.558
Dump her and take me
to the dinner instead.

53:07.608 --> 53:09.646
You want to meet Dr. Callahan
that bad?

53:09.647 --> 53:11.696
I could care less about him.

53:11.697 --> 53:14.796
Then why do you want to be there?
Everybody knows we're not dating.

53:14.797 --> 53:17.867
And this is the perfect
opportunity to show them otherwise.

53:21.957 --> 53:24.016
I thought your opinion
of me had changed.

53:24.017 --> 53:25.555
It has.

53:26.057 --> 53:27.865
But we need each other.

53:28.562 --> 53:33.424
The only thing more pathetic than
a single pastor is a single church lady.

53:34.266 --> 53:36.326
I'll be ready at 6.

53:37.096 --> 53:40.021
If I don't see you I talk to my uncle.

53:43.446 --> 53:45.606
Look on the bright side, Jacob.

53:46.446 --> 53:49.655
Time with a godly woman
will be good for you.

54:05.615 --> 54:09.306
That woman you saw was Leah.

54:09.341 --> 54:11.986
And she thinks what I thought
someone would think.

54:11.989 --> 54:16.147
- I had no way of knowing she was there.
- I know. This is all my fault.

54:17.274 --> 54:18.379
So what now?

54:19.750 --> 54:21.282
She'll keep quiet.

54:21.317 --> 54:23.769
If I take her to the dinner
instead of you.

54:24.114 --> 54:25.364
Are you going to?

54:27.847 --> 54:29.671
I don't see any other way.

54:30.968 --> 54:32.703
She's awful.

54:32.704 --> 54:36.023
Hey.
Don't say that about my wife.

54:36.024 --> 54:38.292
You're overreacting.
You don't have to marry her.

54:38.293 --> 54:39.912
You don't even have
to go to the dinner.

54:39.913 --> 54:41.982
If I don't go, Pastor Campbell
will want to know why.

54:41.983 --> 54:45.316
If I tell him, he's upset.
If I don't tell him, he's upset.

54:46.409 --> 54:47.952
I have to go.

54:47.953 --> 54:50.389
Won't he wonder why
you're suddenly with Leah?

54:50.453 --> 54:54.273
I'll tell him she said something
that had an effect on me.

54:55.153 --> 54:57.363
Jacob, there's something
you're forgetting.

54:58.932 --> 55:01.224
We did not have sex last night.

55:01.482 --> 55:04.299
So why are you so afraid
of someone saying we did?

55:04.532 --> 55:08.642
It's her word against mine.
They'll believe her.

55:10.662 --> 55:12.731
Well, then...

55:12.732 --> 55:14.782
I think you should go to the dinner.

55:16.422 --> 55:19.082
- Thank you for understanding.
- I think you should go with me.

55:20.092 --> 55:23.160
Let Leah tell them what she thinks
and we'll convince them otherwise.

55:23.161 --> 55:25.080
- How?
- I don't know.

55:25.181 --> 55:27.350
But it's the truth.
There has to be a way.

55:27.351 --> 55:30.893
- They'll question my motives.
- We'll have an answer for that, too.

55:32.471 --> 55:35.540
No. Look, none of this is your fault.
You don't have to help me.

55:35.641 --> 55:39.019
I know.
But I want to.

55:42.921 --> 55:44.860
They need to see what I've seen.

56:11.599 --> 56:13.049
Jacob. Welcome!

56:14.704 --> 56:17.500
- You remember my wife, Clara?
- Hello.

56:18.259 --> 56:19.298
This is Rachel.

56:19.299 --> 56:22.030
So nice to meet you.
I've heard so much about you.

56:22.359 --> 56:23.438
This is Rachel.

56:23.439 --> 56:25.438
Is that the best you can
do for an introduction?

56:25.439 --> 56:27.478
Women like it when you
tell the world who they are!

56:27.479 --> 56:28.947
Don't they, my love.

56:29.518 --> 56:31.271
Well, come in.
Have some tea.

56:31.408 --> 56:33.423
We're still waiting for the man
of the hour to arrive.

56:36.045 --> 56:37.708
Maybe she hasn't told him yet?

56:38.758 --> 56:40.655
Either way, you have nothing to hide.

56:43.128 --> 56:47.484
- Hello? Is this Pastor Campbell's house?
- Dr. Callahan! Welcome!

56:49.958 --> 56:50.955
Showtime.

56:51.287 --> 56:55.131
- Always good to see you, Pastor Campbell.
- Please. Call me Tom.

56:55.357 --> 56:58.046
- You've come alone?
- Yes.

56:58.047 --> 57:00.496
Nancy only accompanies me
to the sunny states.

57:00.497 --> 57:03.351
Oh, I see.
This is my wife, Clara.

57:03.397 --> 57:06.045
Who, like yours, thinks there
are better states than Washington.

57:06.080 --> 57:10.517
And this is our newest member of staff
Associate Pastor Jacob Nelson.

57:10.697 --> 57:11.766
And this is his...

57:11.767 --> 57:14.441
- Well, I'll let him introduce her.
- I can introduce myself, thanks.

57:14.496 --> 57:16.263
I'm Rachel. And I'm with him.

57:16.469 --> 57:18.995
Dr. Callahan it is just
so nice to meet you.

57:18.996 --> 57:23.075
Your commentary on 1 Corinthians 7 was
instrumental when writing my thesis.

57:23.076 --> 57:24.135
Thank you.

57:24.136 --> 57:28.245
I actually had some questions
about your analysis of verse 14.

57:28.246 --> 57:30.335
Well I didn't bring
my notes but I can try.

57:30.336 --> 57:31.971
No pressure, of course.

57:32.026 --> 57:34.691
We've asked you here to talk.
Not to lecture.

57:40.575 --> 57:42.625
Excuse me a moment.

57:43.755 --> 57:45.182
So, verse 14.

57:45.185 --> 57:47.666
Do you still hold that the
sanctification referenced

57:47.735 --> 57:50.905
is different from the
sanctification in 2 Timothy 2:21?

57:51.975 --> 57:54.647
You have a great memory.
Much better than mine.

57:55.175 --> 57:57.789
I'm not quite sure what
you're talking about.

57:58.044 --> 57:59.792
If I could hold all my
thoughts in my head...

57:59.804 --> 58:02.264
I wouldn't have to write
them down in a book, would I?

58:02.642 --> 58:05.203
Now, how long have
you two been together?

58:14.324 --> 58:16.410
Thank you for this food
and time of fellowship.

58:16.584 --> 58:18.613
This we pray in the name of Jesus.

58:18.614 --> 58:20.703
- Amen.
- Amen.

58:27.753 --> 58:30.842
Dr. Callahan, I saw your new book
is on the best seller's list.

58:30.843 --> 58:32.902
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

58:32.903 --> 58:36.032
Oh yes. I meant to congratulate you
on that as well.

58:36.033 --> 58:37.082
Thanks.

58:37.083 --> 58:40.152
That's the third time I've been on
the list since they tripled its length.

58:40.580 --> 58:42.191
Well, it's still an accomplishment.

58:42.192 --> 58:44.037
I only feel I've accomplished something

58:44.038 --> 58:47.331
if the people who read the book
are drawn closer to God.

58:47.332 --> 58:50.452
- And how are the numbers on that?
- A few that I have heard from.

58:51.472 --> 58:53.542
And hopefully many more
that I haven't.

58:54.562 --> 58:58.702
Who has a question about marriage
for Dr. Callahan?

58:59.732 --> 59:00.761
Oh, come on.

59:00.762 --> 59:04.911
With all the years of experience at
the table somebody must have something?

59:05.691 --> 59:09.091
It doesn't have to be a question.
I'm open to advice as well.

59:09.911 --> 59:11.190
I have a question.

59:11.191 --> 59:15.501
Sure, Leah. Why not?
Someone with zero marriage experience.

59:16.371 --> 59:20.501
My question isn't for Dr. Callahan.
It's for Jacob.

59:22.541 --> 59:25.600
You have a critically
acclaimed author here.

59:25.601 --> 59:29.230
Are you sure whatever you have to
ask me that now is the best time?

59:29.250 --> 59:31.739
Yes.
Because I think he'll want to hear it.

59:32.481 --> 59:33.759
Dr. Callahan...

59:33.760 --> 59:36.819
Since you're considering us
for the Marriage Coalition

59:36.820 --> 59:40.179
I think you'd be interested
in the character of our pastors.

59:40.380 --> 59:43.979
Which is why I want to ask you, Jacob...

59:43.980 --> 59:46.030
...why you and Rachel
slept together last night?

59:48.619 --> 59:52.258
- Leah! What a thing to say.
- It's the truth.

59:52.259 --> 59:55.279
And I love the church too much
to pretend that I don't know it.

59:56.329 --> 01:00:00.448
- Well?
- We did not have sex.

01:00:00.449 --> 01:00:05.962
However, a certain set of circumstances
caused us to sleep in the same bed last night.

01:00:06.519 --> 01:00:08.838
Okay, then. We'll
discuss this another time.

01:00:08.896 --> 01:00:12.637
I think that's a mistake.
Now that the issue has come up...

01:00:12.638 --> 01:00:16.697
I'm sure that it would give Dr. Callahan
peace of mind to see it dealt with.

01:00:16.698 --> 01:00:20.117
Actually, I'd be happy to have
all of you handle this internally.

01:00:20.149 --> 01:00:21.847
Wise man. Moving on, then.

01:00:21.848 --> 01:00:24.947
- Does that mean you've already decided?
- Jacob, drop it.

01:00:24.948 --> 01:00:27.458
Because there is a perfectly
reasonable explanation.

01:00:27.518 --> 01:00:30.057
Where are we?
Whose table are we at?

01:00:30.058 --> 01:00:32.896
Kindly respect my wishes
and drop it.

01:00:32.897 --> 01:00:35.897
Pastor Campbell, my character is
under attack and I must defend it.

01:00:35.947 --> 01:00:40.183
- So you shall. Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow Dr. Callahan will be gone.

01:00:40.267 --> 01:00:42.426
And I agree with Leah
that he will want to hear this.

01:00:42.427 --> 01:00:45.496
And I agree with him that we
should deal with it without him.

01:00:46.797 --> 01:00:51.336
Pastor Campbell. Dr. Callahan, please.
This is all my fault.

01:00:51.337 --> 01:00:55.667
Jacob did not want to sleep with me.
But he did it because I asked him to.

01:00:58.299 --> 01:01:00.163
Aren't you curious why?

01:01:01.876 --> 01:01:03.945
Okay, then.

01:01:03.946 --> 01:01:05.985
For the record, I have
no idea what's going on.

01:01:06.534 --> 01:01:08.585
It'll all make sense.
You see...

01:01:08.586 --> 01:01:09.989
Wait. Can I tell them?

01:01:11.156 --> 01:01:13.195
We decided that if it
came up I would explain.

01:01:13.196 --> 01:01:14.245
I know.

01:01:14.246 --> 01:01:18.275
But I'm feeling something in my spirit now and
I think it would be better if it came from me.

01:01:22.335 --> 01:01:23.395
Okay.

01:01:25.465 --> 01:01:31.082
Before Jacob and I knew each other
I had sex with many men.

01:01:31.405 --> 01:01:33.363
It was the only way I knew.

01:01:33.635 --> 01:01:37.136
I assumed it was only a matter of time
before Jacob and I did it, too.

01:01:37.698 --> 01:01:40.193
But he was different.

01:01:41.203 --> 01:01:43.111
He said no to temptation.

01:01:43.587 --> 01:01:45.770
So I tried to break him.

01:01:45.994 --> 01:01:48.813
I didn't want to believe that type
of character was possible.

01:01:48.814 --> 01:01:50.957
Because it would mean that I had failed.

01:01:52.054 --> 01:01:56.174
But he was strong.
And I began to see why.

01:01:56.651 --> 01:01:58.126
It was his faith.

01:01:58.264 --> 01:02:00.073
I wanted faith like that.

01:02:00.074 --> 01:02:04.332
And I'm happy to say
that I have repented of my sin

01:02:04.882 --> 01:02:07.766
and accepted Jesus Christ as my savior.

01:02:08.583 --> 01:02:09.861
All because of Jacob.

01:02:13.989 --> 01:02:15.482
Great story.

01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:18.812
That in no way explains
why you slept with him last night.

01:02:18.813 --> 01:02:21.819
I have a stalker.
I didn't feel safe alone.

01:02:21.883 --> 01:02:23.802
So I asked Jacob to sleep with me.

01:02:24.006 --> 01:02:27.121
He wanted to stay on the couch
but I needed him closer.

01:02:27.982 --> 01:02:29.648
Have you ever had a stalker?

01:02:31.112 --> 01:02:32.161
It's awful.

01:02:32.438 --> 01:02:34.202
I was desperate to feel safe again.

01:02:35.479 --> 01:02:38.305
Thankfully there was Jacob.

01:02:39.752 --> 01:02:42.170
Well, I'm glad we got that cleared up.

01:02:42.422 --> 01:02:43.718
Aren't you, Leah?

01:03:06.081 --> 01:03:07.130
Jacob...

01:03:07.530 --> 01:03:09.590
There's someone at the door
asking to see you.

01:03:13.050 --> 01:03:14.435
Excuse me a second.

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:18.065
Are you expecting anyone?

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:22.609
What's up, dude?

01:03:23.010 --> 01:03:24.629
Nice play last night.

01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:26.689
You actually had me going for awhile.

01:03:26.690 --> 01:03:28.630
- What are you doing here?
- Came for my girl.

01:03:28.633 --> 01:03:31.670
- She doesn't want to see you.
- She doesn't get off that easy.

01:03:31.849 --> 01:03:34.748
- I'll always find her.
- You'll always find her with me.

01:03:34.749 --> 01:03:38.645
Good. You're easy to track
and not that much of a threat.

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:41.699
Don't be so sure.
I can be awful protective.

01:03:41.734 --> 01:03:43.122
You're not gonna protect her.

01:03:43.229 --> 01:03:46.225
You're gonna send her out here
to me and never talk to her again.

01:03:46.662 --> 01:03:48.147
Cause if you don't...

01:03:48.179 --> 01:03:50.833
I'll tell all your friends in there
that you've been sleeping with my wife.

01:03:52.724 --> 01:03:55.608
- What?
- She didn't tell you, did she?

01:03:56.178 --> 01:03:58.475
See that was the one piece
of the puzzle I couldn't figure.

01:03:58.728 --> 01:04:00.743
Why would you take her out in public?

01:04:01.612 --> 01:04:04.816
And then I realized you
don't know she's married.

01:04:04.828 --> 01:04:06.354
You're just saying this
to get what you want.

01:04:06.389 --> 01:04:07.973
Doesn't mean it's not true.

01:04:08.008 --> 01:04:10.927
Look, just send her on out here and
you can go back to your little tea party.

01:04:10.928 --> 01:04:13.440
You could have said all this before.
You're just trying to force my hand.

01:04:13.475 --> 01:04:15.067
Right on both counts.

01:04:15.175 --> 01:04:17.087
But if we're not married then...

01:04:17.781 --> 01:04:19.549
Why is she trying to divorce me?

01:04:20.706 --> 01:04:22.139
I want to see her.

01:04:22.625 --> 01:04:23.749
Now.

01:04:32.707 --> 01:04:33.757
It's Phil.

01:04:34.807 --> 01:04:36.677
I'll slip out and talk to him.

01:04:36.817 --> 01:04:38.855
They're on your side now.
You can take it from here.

01:04:38.856 --> 01:04:39.823
Rachel...

01:04:41.268 --> 01:04:42.659
Is it true?

01:04:43.976 --> 01:04:45.712
Are you and Phil married?

01:04:48.906 --> 01:04:51.125
On paper. Yes.

01:04:51.831 --> 01:04:53.717
What does it matter?
I've already been with other people.

01:04:53.721 --> 01:04:56.281
Yes, and I'm one of them.

01:04:57.116 --> 01:04:58.365
How could you do this?

01:04:58.672 --> 01:05:02.475
- I never said I wasn't married.
- Still, you deceived me.

01:05:03.035 --> 01:05:05.431
How is that any different from
what you're doing right now?

01:05:05.585 --> 01:05:07.834
You knew they wouldn't accept you
if they knew the full story.

01:05:07.835 --> 01:05:11.735
So you found a way around it.
It's just how we get by.

01:05:27.104 --> 01:05:28.144
So now what?

01:05:30.031 --> 01:05:33.794
I'll deal with Phil.
You stay and keep impressing them.

01:05:36.434 --> 01:05:41.131
- I'll need to explain your absence.
- Leave it to me.

01:06:07.263 --> 01:06:09.098
Well everyone I have to get going.

01:06:09.212 --> 01:06:11.583
What? Why?

01:06:11.830 --> 01:06:14.272
- You're never gonna believe this, but...
- Wait.

01:06:16.382 --> 01:06:17.422
Let me tell them.

01:06:23.832 --> 01:06:25.901
I've been...

01:06:25.902 --> 01:06:26.942
...lying.

01:06:27.782 --> 01:06:29.031
To all of you.

01:06:30.071 --> 01:06:34.369
Rachel and I aren't dating.
She's just doing me a favor.

01:06:34.404 --> 01:06:36.261
So I could have a seat at the table.

01:06:37.961 --> 01:06:40.969
Which is all I wanted.
But I shouldn't have lied.

01:06:41.765 --> 01:06:43.530
Jacob, now is not the time...

01:06:43.531 --> 01:06:45.621
You'll have my resignation
letter in the morning.

01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:58.160
It was nice meeting you, Dr. Callahan.
I do admire your work.

01:08:13.817 --> 01:08:15.887
Are you hiding from me?

01:08:20.256 --> 01:08:21.986
No, I just...

01:08:23.026 --> 01:08:24.336
I come out here to think.

01:08:25.086 --> 01:08:28.145
So all the times we talked before
you weren't thinking?

01:08:35.366 --> 01:08:38.386
I should probably tell you
that I'm moving.

01:08:39.426 --> 01:08:40.486
Today.

01:08:42.629 --> 01:08:44.615
To get away from Phil or me?

01:08:47.725 --> 01:08:49.182
I haven't decided.

01:08:53.095 --> 01:08:54.788
Did he apologize?

01:08:55.701 --> 01:08:56.904
For what?

01:08:59.207 --> 01:09:01.720
Whatever he did to make
you want to leave him.

01:09:04.783 --> 01:09:05.573
No.

01:09:07.434 --> 01:09:09.018
I cheated on him.

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:12.140
The only thing he did wrong was bore me.

01:09:14.663 --> 01:09:16.738
But he still wants you back.

01:09:18.434 --> 01:09:20.913
He says if I come home all is forgiven.

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:25.044
Sounds like a good deal.

01:09:26.064 --> 01:09:27.223
Sounds boring.

01:09:30.933 --> 01:09:32.303
Did you mean it?

01:09:33.332 --> 01:09:35.013
Last night when you said
you had repented?

01:09:38.048 --> 01:09:39.582
What's it matter now?

01:09:41.282 --> 01:09:46.200
This may come as a shock to you but...
I actually believe what I'm trying to preach.

01:09:47.393 --> 01:09:49.076
We all need the Lord.

01:09:50.702 --> 01:09:53.352
If you remember anything about me
I hope you'll remember that.

01:09:53.386 --> 01:09:57.120
I'll remember you threw your life away
just to prove I couldn't break you.

01:09:57.588 --> 01:10:00.385
Oh, you broke me a long time
before last night.

01:10:02.092 --> 01:10:03.905
Then why are you smiling?

01:10:05.345 --> 01:10:07.303
That's what repentance does.

01:10:07.848 --> 01:10:09.172
Changes you.

01:10:14.141 --> 01:10:15.611
So what now for you?

01:10:16.451 --> 01:10:17.943
Back to Uganda.

01:10:19.392 --> 01:10:22.611
It's not like home,
but neither is home anymore.

01:10:23.964 --> 01:10:25.578
And I have what I want there.

01:10:26.218 --> 01:10:28.299
They treat me like a real pastor.

01:10:29.116 --> 01:10:32.941
Well, for what it's worth,
you were always a real pastor to me.

01:10:40.322 --> 01:10:42.149
I should get going.

01:10:42.742 --> 01:10:45.811
I'd give you a hug but I know
how you are about touching.

01:10:50.773 --> 01:10:51.863
Goodbye.

01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:54.326
Goodbye.

01:10:59.489 --> 01:11:00.504
Rachel...

01:11:35.498 --> 01:11:36.692
Hello, Jacob.

01:11:37.068 --> 01:11:38.127
Pastor Campbell.

01:11:38.662 --> 01:11:39.849
Got your letter.

01:11:41.287 --> 01:11:43.302
I sent one to the elders as well.

01:11:44.541 --> 01:11:46.990
Following church policy even to the end.

01:11:49.507 --> 01:11:51.196
Why did you want to work here?

01:11:53.292 --> 01:11:56.696
- I wanted to be a pastor.
- But why here? At my church?

01:11:57.599 --> 01:11:59.409
When you clearly don't like me.

01:12:01.969 --> 01:12:04.590
People I like are hard to come by.

01:12:05.230 --> 01:12:07.632
That's true of all of us.
Sinners that we are.

01:12:07.667 --> 01:12:09.750
But why my particular church of sinners?

01:12:11.826 --> 01:12:13.276
I thought you wanted me.

01:12:17.704 --> 01:12:21.482
Dr. Callahan isn't gonna work with us.
Just so you know.

01:12:22.546 --> 01:12:24.645
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

01:12:25.338 --> 01:12:27.115
You were the only one he liked.

01:12:27.150 --> 01:12:31.513
He described your confession
as the only point all evening

01:12:31.855 --> 01:12:34.149
...when he knew
someone was being honest.

01:12:35.778 --> 01:12:38.254
And he recommended
I follow your example.

01:12:39.079 --> 01:12:41.562
That is humbling to hear.

01:12:42.145 --> 01:12:43.215
Yes it was.

01:12:47.304 --> 01:12:48.305
Well...

01:12:49.334 --> 01:12:50.594
...this is it.

01:12:57.870 --> 01:12:59.513
I wish you all the best.

01:13:07.454 --> 01:13:08.432
Jacob...

01:13:12.895 --> 01:13:14.589
Would you consider staying on?

01:13:15.576 --> 01:13:18.864
- Why? So you can win over Dr. Callahan?
- Oh, no.

01:13:18.868 --> 01:13:20.207
That ship has sailed.

01:13:20.293 --> 01:13:22.373
But there's still a chance
I can follow his advice.

01:13:22.823 --> 01:13:24.449
I want to see you ordained.

01:13:25.252 --> 01:13:27.388
I wasn't holding back
because you're single.

01:13:27.443 --> 01:13:29.120
I was single when I was ordained.

01:13:29.155 --> 01:13:32.330
I wanted to be sure that you
believe in what we do here.

01:13:32.365 --> 01:13:34.847
Or what we try to do, anyway.

01:13:34.882 --> 01:13:37.861
Sorry it took such an
embarrassing spectacle to prove it.

01:13:37.862 --> 01:13:38.900
Don't be embarrassed.

01:13:38.952 --> 01:13:42.172
Confessing sin shows the need
for the very Savior we proclaim.

01:13:43.062 --> 01:13:46.112
I just wish it didn't sting so bad
but there seems to be no avoiding it.

01:13:49.086 --> 01:13:52.172
Would I get to preach
in the main service?

01:13:52.722 --> 01:13:54.650
Every once in awhile, sure.

01:13:55.581 --> 01:13:58.284
And if you show me more respect
than you have in the past...

01:13:58.869 --> 01:14:00.321
...I could do the same for you.

01:14:03.311 --> 01:14:05.441
There is one more thing
you should know.

01:14:07.293 --> 01:14:09.621
I have no desire to date your niece.

01:14:10.651 --> 01:14:11.801
Fair enough.

01:14:13.841 --> 01:14:15.880
Well, can I count you in?

01:14:16.381 --> 01:14:17.850
Of course.

01:14:19.230 --> 01:14:21.150
Otherwise I'd be a hypocrite.

01:14:22.151 --> 01:14:28.150
