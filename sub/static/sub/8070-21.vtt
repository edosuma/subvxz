[theme music]

00:51.785 --> 00:54.188
[jazzy music]

00:57.825 --> 00:59.327
Hey, I am not
spending my summer

00:59.427 --> 01:01.529
vacation at the Grand Canyon.

01:01.629 --> 01:02.630
Yeah, no way.

01:02.730 --> 01:03.697
Why not?

01:03.797 --> 01:04.865
Think about it, Dan.

01:04.965 --> 01:07.335
You make some long, sweaty
car trip just so you

01:07.435 --> 01:10.471
can look down a big hole.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.840
You don't want any of
us standing behind you.

01:12.940 --> 01:14.142
OK.

01:14.242 --> 01:15.476
Show of hands.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.345
Who doesn't want to go to
the Grand Canyon this summer?

01:17.445 --> 01:19.847
All right, you don't want to
do anything as a family, fine.

01:19.947 --> 01:21.549
We'll spend the summer
in the inflatable pool.

01:21.649 --> 01:24.685
Ooh, show of hands.

01:24.785 --> 01:26.554
Meeting adjourned.

01:26.654 --> 01:28.356
- See ya next year.
- Yeah.

01:28.456 --> 01:30.158
Where do you think you're going?
- Basketball.

01:30.258 --> 01:31.091
Bye.

01:31.192 --> 01:32.360
No, you're gonna
do the dishes,

01:32.460 --> 01:34.295
or else you're not getting
your allowance next week.

01:34.395 --> 01:35.196
Deal.

01:35.296 --> 01:36.096
Thanks.

01:38.799 --> 01:42.069
Well, I guess a $3 threat
ain't what it used to be.

01:42.170 --> 01:43.003
Becky!

01:43.103 --> 01:43.971
No.

01:44.071 --> 01:45.639
[whack]

01:45.739 --> 01:49.210
They don't even try
to humor us anymore.

01:49.310 --> 01:51.212
How come I got three
kids and a husband

01:51.312 --> 01:53.814
and I end up doing
all the grunt work?

01:53.914 --> 01:55.015
The beauty part
is, you actually

01:55.115 --> 01:57.785
grunt while you're doing it.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.987
I want a dishwasher.

02:00.087 --> 02:00.988
I know.

02:01.088 --> 02:02.390
We've been all through
this, Roseanne.

02:02.490 --> 02:04.358
The kitchen wasn't
designed for one.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.826
You don't have the
right kind of plumbing.

02:05.926 --> 02:08.095
You'd lose half
your cabinet space.

02:08.196 --> 02:09.863
Trust me, I'm a
professional contractor.

02:09.963 --> 02:10.898
It can't be done.

02:10.998 --> 02:12.300
Well, then I want
you to go in there

02:12.400 --> 02:14.702
and build me that shelf by the
front door there like I want.

02:14.802 --> 02:17.104
Well, that's a whole 'nother
other ball of worms there, now.

02:17.205 --> 02:18.939
You ain't got the right
kind of wall studs in there

02:19.039 --> 02:22.243
and the whole unit
would fall right over.

02:22.343 --> 02:23.844
You never build me nothing.

02:23.944 --> 02:26.414
Hey, hey, hey, what about
this fabulous service porch

02:26.514 --> 02:28.482
I built you for your
washer and dryer?

02:28.582 --> 02:30.551
Oh, yeah, just because
you got tired of watching me

02:30.651 --> 02:32.820
do the laundry in the rain.

02:32.920 --> 02:33.754
Hey.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.122
Hi.

02:35.223 --> 02:37.024
You didn't tell me the new
neighbors were moving in today.

02:37.124 --> 02:38.058
What's the story?

02:38.158 --> 02:38.959
What are they like?

02:39.059 --> 02:40.294
I don't know.

02:40.394 --> 02:42.129
Yeah, like you haven't been
watching through the window

02:42.230 --> 02:44.198
all morning.

02:44.298 --> 02:48.636
OK, well, the husband,
Darrin, he's in advertising.

02:48.736 --> 02:51.405
And then they have this real
cute little girl, Tabitha.

02:51.505 --> 02:54.041
But the wife, I don't know.

02:54.141 --> 02:54.942
Something's wrong with her.

02:55.042 --> 02:57.445
I think she's a witch.

02:57.545 --> 02:58.912
[door slams]

02:59.012 --> 03:00.348
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:00.448 --> 03:02.350
Who's this?
- He's Todd.

03:02.450 --> 03:03.584
He just moved in next door.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.319
He's my new best friend.

03:05.419 --> 03:07.488
Well, hi, Todd,
nice to meet ya.

03:07.588 --> 03:09.423
Hi.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.426
Can Todd camp out in the back
yard with you and me next week?

03:12.526 --> 03:14.127
Sure, if it's
OK with his folks.

03:14.228 --> 03:15.128
Great.

03:15.229 --> 03:16.630
Do you have to come?

03:16.730 --> 03:19.367
It's my tent.

03:19.467 --> 03:20.601
It'll be OK.

03:20.701 --> 03:21.535
Yeah.

03:21.635 --> 03:22.870
I burp real good.
[doorbell rings]

03:22.970 --> 03:24.171
Prove it.

03:24.272 --> 03:25.373
Well, you're on, Dan.

03:25.473 --> 03:27.808
You better hold onto
the table there, Todd.

03:27.908 --> 03:29.977
Yeah, you're not wearing
anything flammable, are ya,

03:30.077 --> 03:30.878
boy?

03:33.080 --> 03:33.881
Hello.

03:33.981 --> 03:35.683
Hi, I'm Kathy Bowman.

03:35.783 --> 03:37.084
I was looking for my son, Todd.

03:37.184 --> 03:38.185
Did he come over here?

03:38.286 --> 03:39.487
Oh, yeah, you're
the new neighbor.

03:39.587 --> 03:40.388
Yeah, come on in.

03:40.488 --> 03:41.289
I'm Roseanne Conner.

03:41.389 --> 03:44.525
DAN: [drawn-out belch]

03:51.599 --> 03:54.535
Uh, that was my husband.

03:54.635 --> 03:55.669
Oh.

03:55.769 --> 04:01.309
ROSEANNE: [chuckling]
Keep your hands off him.

04:01.409 --> 04:04.378
Uh, so is Todd here?

04:04.478 --> 04:07.147
Oh, yeah. (YELLING) Hey,
Todd, your mom's here.

04:10.618 --> 04:11.985
Hey, hi, neighbor.

04:12.085 --> 04:15.088
My husband Dan, my
sister Jackie, that's DJ,

04:15.188 --> 04:16.824
yeah, and you know Todd.

04:16.924 --> 04:19.293
Mom, Mr. Conner's real cool.

04:19.393 --> 04:20.628
Yes, I heard.

04:20.728 --> 04:22.162
Aw, that.

04:22.262 --> 04:26.334
I coulda done better, but I
didn't wanna hurt the lad.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.936
Uh, Todd, honey, we've
got a lot of packing to do.

04:29.036 --> 04:31.972
Aw, Mom, DJ was just
gonna show me his room.

04:32.072 --> 04:33.307
It'll only take a minute.

04:33.407 --> 04:34.542
Hey, yeah, while
you're up there,

04:34.642 --> 04:35.976
show him how to make
his bed, wouldja?

04:36.076 --> 04:36.877
All right!

04:39.246 --> 04:40.681
Well, hey, do you
want some coffee?

04:40.781 --> 04:41.582
I've got some.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.216
I've got some fudge, too.

04:43.317 --> 04:45.619
It's nowhere near as
thick as the coffee,

04:45.719 --> 04:48.021
but it's pretty good.

04:48.121 --> 04:48.922
Well, uh, no.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.358
No thanks.

04:50.458 --> 04:51.859
Well, sit down, at least.

04:51.959 --> 04:52.993
Oh, I can only stay a minute.

04:55.663 --> 04:56.464
So.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.668
You guys been doing a
lot of work over there

05:00.768 --> 05:03.437
the last couple months.

05:03.537 --> 05:04.838
I hope the workmen
didn't bother you.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.073
Nah.

05:06.173 --> 05:07.908
Oh, no, except for one
time when they came over

05:08.008 --> 05:09.410
and asked us to hold it down.

05:17.418 --> 05:18.218
Your turn.

05:21.955 --> 05:23.357
So, where are you from?

05:23.457 --> 05:24.525
Oh, uh, Chicago.

05:24.625 --> 05:25.926
Oh, Chicago.

05:26.026 --> 05:26.960
Oh, I love it there.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.328
There's so much
going on, you know,

05:28.429 --> 05:31.064
with the restaurants and the
museums and the theaters.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.600
[muffled squeak]

05:32.700 --> 05:33.501
Huh?

05:33.601 --> 05:35.168
What?

05:35.268 --> 05:36.970
I'm sorry.
I sneezed.

05:37.070 --> 05:39.740
I, uh-- I'm allergic to dust.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.751
I just dusted.

05:50.851 --> 05:51.852
Oh.

05:51.952 --> 05:54.187
It's the only thing
that makes me sneeze.

05:54.287 --> 05:58.792
[muffled squeak]

05:58.892 --> 05:59.960
You call that a sneeze?

06:04.432 --> 06:06.033
See ya later, DJ.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.034
Bye, Todd.

06:07.134 --> 06:08.268
It's very nice
meeting all of you.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.937
I'm sure I'll see you around.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.439
Yeah, If you need
anything, give us a call.

06:11.539 --> 06:12.840
Oh, thanks.
[sucking hiss] Heh.

06:17.177 --> 06:18.178
Man, she is a witch.

06:18.278 --> 06:20.581
Now, Roseanne.

06:20.681 --> 06:21.615
She hated my house.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.316
She just sneezed--

06:23.417 --> 06:25.318
sorta.

06:25.419 --> 06:28.021
She wouldn't sit down,
she wouldn't have coffee,

06:28.121 --> 06:30.157
you know, she wouldn't even take
two steps away from the door.

06:30.257 --> 06:31.625
She just couldn't wait
to get outta here.

06:31.725 --> 06:34.695
So she's nervous
about new people.

06:34.795 --> 06:35.596
Why?

06:35.696 --> 06:36.964
We're fun.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.365
Oh, I don't know.

06:38.466 --> 06:41.368
Maybe she was a little uptight.

06:41.469 --> 06:43.637
A little uptight?

06:43.737 --> 06:45.205
Hey, man, you
couldn't drag a needle

06:45.305 --> 06:48.108
out of her butt with a tractor.

06:48.208 --> 06:50.578
[music playing]

06:59.019 --> 07:00.688
Remember, we're here
because we're neighbors

07:00.788 --> 07:02.355
and we wanna be friendly.

07:02.456 --> 07:03.857
No, I'm here looking for dust.

07:06.727 --> 07:08.529
This isn't going to
be pleasant, is it?

07:08.629 --> 07:09.663
And you know what?

07:09.763 --> 07:11.298
If I find any dust, you
know what I'm gonna do?

07:11.398 --> 07:12.633
I'm gonna sneeze.

07:12.733 --> 07:15.435
And not one of them little
needle-butt sneezes, neither.

07:15.536 --> 07:18.572
I'm gonna blow a lung
all over her living room.

07:21.141 --> 07:21.942
Welcome Wagon.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.176
Welcome Wagon.

07:23.276 --> 07:27.414
Oh, how neighborly.

07:27.515 --> 07:28.549
Well, come on in.

07:31.284 --> 07:34.955
I'll just put this
in the kitchen.

07:35.055 --> 07:36.890
Neighborly.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.358
(HIGH-PITCHED) Ah-chew.

07:42.830 --> 07:45.599
My god, Roseanne,
this is our house.

07:45.699 --> 07:48.068
Same floor plan, same
stairs, same archway--

07:48.168 --> 07:50.370
it's the exact same house.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.540
Man, this is the
house I coulda had if I

07:52.640 --> 07:53.774
woulda married somebody better.

07:56.777 --> 07:58.612
Thank you.

07:58.712 --> 08:01.014
My, uh, husband's
in the study.

08:01.114 --> 08:02.382
I'll just go get him.

08:02.482 --> 08:03.283
Study?

08:06.820 --> 08:09.790
He turned our
bedroom into a study.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.559
Well, you turned the
bathroom into a library.

08:16.830 --> 08:17.665
Look at that.

08:17.765 --> 08:19.767
You been lying to
me for 12 years.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.134
What?

08:21.234 --> 08:24.638
That there is the very shelf
I told you I wanted, which you

08:24.738 --> 08:26.139
says I can't have
on account of there

08:26.239 --> 08:27.507
wasn't the right
studs in the wall.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.309
Whoa-ho, stand back
honey, that sucker's liable

08:29.409 --> 08:30.210
to fall over any minute.

08:30.310 --> 08:32.980
This place is a death trap.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.381
Hey, there, neighbors.

08:34.481 --> 08:35.515
Jerry Bowman.

08:35.616 --> 08:36.416
Hey, Dan Conner.

08:36.516 --> 08:37.718
This my wife, Roseanne.

08:37.818 --> 08:39.052
Great to meetcha.

08:39.152 --> 08:41.454
Boy, we lived in our apartment
in Chicago for nine years

08:41.555 --> 08:42.890
and neighbors never
once brought us cake.

08:42.990 --> 08:43.791
Come on, let's eat.

08:47.260 --> 08:48.596
Man.

08:48.696 --> 08:50.664
I just can't believe
how much your living

08:50.764 --> 08:52.232
room reminds me of ours.

08:54.935 --> 08:57.170
Well, I'm not quite
finished with it yet.

09:00.073 --> 09:02.275
Honey.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.544
Remember, for
better or for worse.

09:09.082 --> 09:10.250
It's a dishwasher!

09:14.855 --> 09:17.057
DAN: Well, hey, I'll bet you
had to tear out half the kitchen

09:17.157 --> 09:18.258
to get that sucker in there.

09:18.358 --> 09:19.660
No, not really.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.228
At first I thought there wasn't
gonna be room for a dishwasher,

09:21.328 --> 09:23.430
but then the contractor
slid it right in.

09:23.530 --> 09:24.632
Whole thing took an hour.

09:29.136 --> 09:30.838
Was there cake?

09:30.938 --> 09:32.272
Yeah, come on, sit down.

09:35.175 --> 09:39.680
Oh, uh, you know, I
don't have any coffee.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.782
Well, why don't we
go on over to our house

09:41.882 --> 09:43.250
and I'll make us a pot?

09:43.350 --> 09:47.721
Boy, I'd love to,
but I'm awfully tired.

09:47.821 --> 09:49.990
Oh, uh, well, um,
maybe we should do

09:50.090 --> 09:50.991
this another time, then, huh?

09:51.091 --> 09:52.092
Yeah, I'm sorry,
we should have

09:52.192 --> 09:53.560
given you time to settle in.
- Yeah.

09:53.661 --> 09:54.762
Yeah.

09:54.862 --> 09:56.664
We just need a little
time to settle in, there.

09:56.764 --> 09:59.599
But look, thanks
for coming and, uh,

09:59.700 --> 10:00.701
we'll do this another time, OK?

10:00.801 --> 10:01.702
OK.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.303
Good night, Jerry,
good night, Kathy.

10:03.403 --> 10:04.805
JERRY: Good night, Rosanne.

10:04.905 --> 10:07.374
Good night, Dan.

10:07.474 --> 10:09.810

10:17.217 --> 10:18.952
No coffee, I'm sure.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.722
She just couldn't wait to
get us out of her house.

10:21.822 --> 10:24.057
Honey, honey, calm down.

10:24.157 --> 10:26.259
You'll feel better after
a good night's sleep.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.796
Oh, yeah, like I'm gonna get
any sleep with all the noise

10:28.896 --> 10:30.698
you're gonna be making
building me that new shelf.

10:34.001 --> 10:34.968
I'll try to keep it down.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.878
So, you know, I'm over there
at Buy & Bag and everything,

10:44.978 --> 10:46.747
so I see Kathy walking by.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.448
And I'm her neighbor and
everything, so I go to wave

10:48.548 --> 10:49.917
at her, you know, hi, Kathy.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.284
OK.

10:51.384 --> 10:52.820
She sees me, but she walks right
by like she doesn't see me,

10:52.920 --> 10:54.154
you know?

10:54.254 --> 10:55.889
And so I'm standing there
with, like, my hand in the air,

10:55.989 --> 10:57.157
you know?

10:57.257 --> 10:59.827
So then, you know how you
have to wave at somebody?

10:59.927 --> 11:02.495
So I end up waving at
the produce manager,

11:02.595 --> 11:04.231
and now he thinks I
have the hots for him.

11:07.567 --> 11:09.436
I wish I could meet
a guy in management.

11:12.605 --> 11:13.907
I mean, I just don't
get it, you know?

11:14.007 --> 11:17.077
Her kid plays with my kid, her
husband plays with my husband.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.678
I just don't know why
she won't play with me.

11:18.779 --> 11:20.080
What is it with you?

11:20.180 --> 11:22.482
You never used to worry about
what people thought about you.

11:22.582 --> 11:26.353
Well, yeah, that's
'cause everybody likes me.

11:26.453 --> 11:27.254
OK.

11:27.354 --> 11:28.856
What does Dan say, huh?

11:28.956 --> 11:31.124
He talks to that
Jerry guy, right?

11:31.224 --> 11:32.359
Well, yeah.

11:32.459 --> 11:34.962
Well, he goes that she
never wanted to [ahem] leave

11:35.062 --> 11:36.429
Chicago in the
first place and she

11:36.529 --> 11:37.664
don't like it here that much.

11:37.765 --> 11:38.698
Well, big deal, you know?

11:38.799 --> 11:40.067
Nobody likes it here.

11:40.167 --> 11:43.837
That's why we watch
so damn much TV.

11:43.937 --> 11:45.272
Can I go now?

11:45.372 --> 11:46.673
I suppose.
JACKIE: All right.

11:46.774 --> 11:47.474
Bye.
ROSEANNE: Bye.

11:47.574 --> 11:48.508
Roseanne--

11:48.608 --> 11:49.409
Yeah?

11:49.509 --> 11:50.610
I like ya.

11:50.710 --> 11:51.945
Oh, thanks, Sis.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.915
Of course, then, I don't
have to live next door to ya.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.449
Ha, ha.

11:56.549 --> 11:57.851
50 bucks.

11:57.951 --> 11:59.052
What a moron.

11:59.152 --> 12:01.688
I didn't know it was
a handicap space, OK?

12:01.789 --> 12:03.056
Oh, what?

12:03.156 --> 12:05.225
That little glow-in-the-dark
wheelchair didn't tip you off?

12:08.161 --> 12:09.930
Mom, look.

12:10.030 --> 12:14.401
Oh, man, it's your
very first ticket.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.003
It's just beautiful.

12:16.103 --> 12:17.470
I'm gonna put it up
here on the fridge

12:17.570 --> 12:20.607
next to DJ's finger-painting.

12:20.707 --> 12:22.976
What am I gonna do?

12:23.076 --> 12:24.444
Pay it.

12:24.544 --> 12:26.847
How about if I say it
blew off the car window?

12:26.947 --> 12:28.381
Yeah, that's a good one.

12:28.481 --> 12:30.183
Yeah, I think the
judge will go for that.

12:30.283 --> 12:32.986
Maybe it's like his
first minute on the job.

12:33.086 --> 12:33.921
[door slams]

12:34.922 --> 12:35.755
Hi, Mom.

12:35.856 --> 12:39.326
Todd cut his arm.
- Aw, geez.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.794
Darlene, get me a Band-Aid.

12:40.894 --> 12:42.529
What happened?

12:42.629 --> 12:43.730
We were playing
down where they're

12:43.831 --> 12:46.066
building the new supermarket.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.500
I told you not
to go down there.

12:47.600 --> 12:48.601
You could get hurt.

12:48.701 --> 12:50.838
I didn't.

12:50.938 --> 12:51.805
Oh, man.

12:51.905 --> 12:55.442
Well, that's the
beauty there, Todd.

12:55.542 --> 12:56.844
There you go.

12:56.944 --> 13:00.347
You better go home and show
it to your mom, now, OK?

13:00.447 --> 13:03.316
And tell her to dress you real
warm for the campout tonight.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.185
Bye.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.720
See you tonight.
- Where you going?

13:07.821 --> 13:09.222
I'm not done yelling at you yet.

13:09.322 --> 13:10.123
Hey.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.461
I told you you're not
supposed to go down

13:14.561 --> 13:16.229
to construction sites to play.

13:16.329 --> 13:18.832
It's dangerous and
you could get hurt.

13:18.932 --> 13:20.233
But Todd's never
been to one before.

13:20.333 --> 13:21.568
I don't care.

13:21.668 --> 13:23.270
That's what I told you and
that's what I want you to do.

13:23.370 --> 13:24.171
OK.

13:24.271 --> 13:25.405
I'm sorry.

13:25.505 --> 13:26.306
OK.

13:26.406 --> 13:28.541
Go on upstairs.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.143
Darlene, I was
driving you to the mall,

13:30.243 --> 13:32.145
so you should pay
half the ticket.

13:32.245 --> 13:33.546
That's 25 bucks.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.548
[sigh] OK, $15.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.516
$10.

13:36.616 --> 13:37.584
$12.50.

13:37.684 --> 13:41.188
Mm, nah, you pay
the whole thing.

13:41.288 --> 13:42.155
[doorbell rings]

13:51.031 --> 13:52.632
Oh, hi, Kathy.

13:52.732 --> 13:55.402
I was just cleaning
up a little bit.

13:55.502 --> 13:58.205
Todd told me that
he cut his arm at--

13:58.305 --> 14:00.573
at some construction site.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.109
Did you know they were there?

14:02.209 --> 14:03.810
Oh, yeah, they just told me.

14:03.911 --> 14:06.779
[gasp] Roseanne, I left
him here assuming that

14:06.880 --> 14:09.282
you would keep an eye on him.

14:09.382 --> 14:10.617
They took off on their bikes.

14:10.717 --> 14:13.086
And you allow your son to
just leave whenever he wants?

14:13.186 --> 14:15.989
Yeah, I encourage it.

14:16.089 --> 14:16.990
I don't know, Roseanne.

14:17.090 --> 14:17.925
I don't know.

14:18.025 --> 14:19.492
When my son takes
off on his bike,

14:19.592 --> 14:20.894
I like to ask him
where he's going.

14:20.994 --> 14:23.196
And if he tells me it's a place
with-- with broken glass and,

14:23.296 --> 14:27.000
and, and little pieces
of metal, I say no.

14:27.100 --> 14:28.068
Well, I just don't believe it.

14:28.168 --> 14:29.736
You're finally coming
over here, but it's

14:29.836 --> 14:32.205
just to tell me that you're
a better mom than I am.

14:32.305 --> 14:36.076
I always know where
my son is, Roseanne.

14:36.176 --> 14:38.311
Well, I've got
three kids and a job

14:38.411 --> 14:39.779
and I can't be everywhere, OK?

14:39.879 --> 14:42.682
So I've gotta trust my kids,
and they're still alive, so I've

14:42.782 --> 14:44.684
obviously done something right.

14:44.784 --> 14:47.687
So now you're a better mother
because you have more children?

14:47.787 --> 14:48.721
Yes.

14:48.821 --> 14:50.457
I have three and
you only have one.

14:50.557 --> 14:51.858
Three-to-one, get it?
I have three.

14:51.959 --> 14:52.759
I win.

14:58.098 --> 14:59.499
Oh, please.

14:59.599 --> 15:02.035
Oh, you probably still sneak
into Todd's room at night

15:02.135 --> 15:03.236
and check if he's breathing.
- Yes.

15:03.336 --> 15:04.137
Amateur.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.542
My son could have been
seriously injured today,

15:09.642 --> 15:10.877
Roseanne.

15:10.978 --> 15:13.013
Hey, we're talking about
eight-year-old boys here, OK?

15:13.113 --> 15:14.547
Now, if you're going to
blame me for everything

15:14.647 --> 15:17.017
they do that you don't
like, then just don't

15:17.117 --> 15:18.751
send Todd over here anymore.

15:18.851 --> 15:20.020
That is exactly
what I had in mind.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.088
Oh, yeah?

15:21.188 --> 15:22.522
Well, I'm gonna go
you one better, Kathy.

15:22.622 --> 15:24.491
I'm not sending DJ over
to your house, either,

15:24.591 --> 15:27.427
because I don't need him
picking up any of your attitude.

15:27.527 --> 15:32.399
Oh, and just exactly
what attitude is that?

15:32.499 --> 15:34.867
(IMITATING KATHY'S VOICE)
That one right there.

15:34.968 --> 15:36.703
(NORMAL VOICE) You know, the
one where you think you're

15:36.803 --> 15:38.338
too damn good to
live next door to me.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.739
Well, you're not.

15:39.839 --> 15:42.475
You're just some stressed-out
overprotective snob who

15:42.575 --> 15:43.876
paid way too much for a house.

15:48.615 --> 15:49.716
And how do you know how much--

15:49.816 --> 15:52.919
Everybody knows.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.054
Look, just forget
it, Roseanne.

15:54.154 --> 15:55.155
Forget it.

15:55.255 --> 15:56.423
I don't know why I am
even talking to you.

15:56.523 --> 15:57.324
Well, you're not.

15:57.424 --> 15:58.258
[slam]

16:01.261 --> 16:03.530
[music playing]

16:08.435 --> 16:11.904
DAN: Police knew the
killer was insane.

16:12.005 --> 16:17.177
At night he would stalk
poor, unsuspecting campers.

16:17.277 --> 16:22.682
And as he would creep up upon
their tents, he would whistle.

16:22.782 --> 16:25.152
[spooky whistling]

16:30.657 --> 16:35.895
And then he'd hack 'em
to pieces with a machete.

16:35.995 --> 16:36.829
Can I have a machete?

16:36.929 --> 16:38.931
No.

16:39.032 --> 16:41.701
Well, did they ever catch him?

16:41.801 --> 16:43.170
Yeah, once.

16:43.270 --> 16:45.572
They handcuffed
him, but he hacked

16:45.672 --> 16:48.341
off his own hand to escape.

16:48.441 --> 16:54.514
And now he has a hook which
he uses to kill his victims

16:54.614 --> 16:58.051
and drag their lifeless corpses
along the bloody ground.

17:01.954 --> 17:03.290
What happened to the machete?

17:03.390 --> 17:06.426
You can't have one.

17:06.526 --> 17:10.863
Anyway, he was last
spotted here in Lanford.

17:10.963 --> 17:12.099
Police have been
searching for days--

17:12.199 --> 17:13.900
THE HOOK: [breathy whistling]
- What was that?

17:14.000 --> 17:14.801
What?

17:14.901 --> 17:17.003
[gasp] The whistling killer.

17:17.104 --> 17:19.606
Don't make a sound,
we'll be safe in here.

17:19.706 --> 17:20.540
THE HOOK: [scream]

17:20.640 --> 17:23.376
DAN: [screaming] It's The Hook!

17:23.476 --> 17:24.477
Mom, I thought
you were supposed

17:24.577 --> 17:26.579
to bring us something to eat.

17:30.150 --> 17:32.985
THE HOOK: Aargh!

17:33.086 --> 17:34.954
Thanks.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.523
Did we scare you, DJ?

17:36.623 --> 17:37.757
Yeah.

17:37.857 --> 17:40.927
He was just scared you were
gonna hurt the hook guy.

17:41.027 --> 17:42.529
- Well, carry on.
- All right.

17:42.629 --> 17:43.830
Where was I?

17:43.930 --> 17:46.766
I still don't get why Todd
couldn't be here tonight.

17:46.866 --> 17:48.668
DAN: Well, I'm here and
we're having fun, aren't we?

17:48.768 --> 17:50.637
Yeah, but he's my best friend.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.606
Well, you guys got
in trouble together.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.775
DJ: So, when can we
play together again?

17:55.875 --> 17:58.077
DAN: Well, when you can
prove you won't do it again.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.113
How can we do that if we
can't even play together?

18:00.213 --> 18:01.448
[sigh] Aw, hang on
a minute, will ya?

18:04.884 --> 18:07.787
You're here.

18:07.887 --> 18:10.657
Yeah, and I heard.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.058
Rosie?

18:12.159 --> 18:13.426
Well, Dan, if I go
over there, you know,

18:13.526 --> 18:15.362
that's gonna be like admitting
I was wrong, you know,

18:15.462 --> 18:17.397
and I wasn't wrong.

18:17.497 --> 18:18.431
Do it for the kids.

18:18.531 --> 18:21.033
Oh, cut the
telethon crap, Dan.

18:24.404 --> 18:27.540
Geez, I have to go over
there and eat crow?

18:27.640 --> 18:28.708
You'll be the better person.

18:31.644 --> 18:33.045
Oh, all right.

18:33.146 --> 18:34.814
Well, tell him another story.
I'll be right back.

18:34.914 --> 18:35.715
DAN: All right.

18:38.618 --> 18:41.053
Did I ever tell you about the
killer who carried his own head

18:41.154 --> 18:41.988
around in a bowling bag?

18:42.088 --> 18:42.889
No.

18:48.695 --> 18:49.796
I'm a better person.

18:49.896 --> 18:50.830
I'm a better person.

18:50.930 --> 18:52.765
I'm a better person.

18:52.865 --> 18:53.666
Well, if I don't kill her.

19:01.608 --> 19:03.543
Roseanne.

19:03.643 --> 19:04.877
Hi.

19:04.977 --> 19:09.849
Um, I came to invite
Todd to DJ's campout.

19:09.949 --> 19:13.085
Well, I don't know.

19:13.186 --> 19:17.757
Well, I'm sure that we both
said things that we regret.

19:17.857 --> 19:19.626
I, uh--

19:19.726 --> 19:20.860
I meant what I said.

19:24.764 --> 19:25.632
OK.

19:25.732 --> 19:31.271
Uh, I regret what I said, OK?

19:31.371 --> 19:36.876
Uh, like, DJ really likes Todd.

19:36.976 --> 19:41.381
And to be quite frank, DJ
doesn't have that many friends.

19:41.481 --> 19:44.684
Well, maybe that has something
to do with the attitude

19:44.784 --> 19:46.686
with which he was raised.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.020
[deep inhale]

19:50.357 --> 19:52.725
Well, now, that's
something to chew on.

19:57.096 --> 20:00.933
So, can Todd come?

20:01.033 --> 20:03.536
Roseanne, I just
wish I could be sure

20:03.636 --> 20:05.438
that when Todd is
over there, he is

20:05.538 --> 20:08.241
receiving the same
kind of supervision he

20:08.341 --> 20:09.809
would be getting here at home.

20:09.909 --> 20:10.943
OK, hey.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.580
I personally guarantee
his safe return.

20:17.016 --> 20:22.054
Well, [sigh] as long as you're
admitting that you are wrong.

20:31.431 --> 20:32.231
Fine.

20:36.769 --> 20:38.405
OK.

20:38.505 --> 20:41.173
I'll just see if
Todd wants to go.

20:41.274 --> 20:42.542
Todd--

20:42.642 --> 20:45.378
Bye!

20:45.478 --> 20:46.313
[door slams]

20:47.647 --> 20:49.582
Well, you know, Kathy,
just because we're neighbors

20:49.682 --> 20:51.418
doesn't mean we have
to like each other.

20:51.518 --> 20:53.320
No, we don't.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.355
- We don't even have to pretend.
- No, I know.

20:55.455 --> 20:58.325
But, you know, we shouldn't
take it out on the kids.

21:01.127 --> 21:02.495
Fine.

21:02.595 --> 21:03.396
OK.

21:06.833 --> 21:09.702
Good night, Roseanne.

21:09.802 --> 21:11.037
Good night, needle-butt.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.241
[blues music]

21:23.750 --> 21:25.151
[chamber music]

21:31.257 --> 21:32.659
[blues music]

21:41.133 --> 21:43.803
[chamber music]
