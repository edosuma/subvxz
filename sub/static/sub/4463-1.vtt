00:43.708 --> 00:46.000
Take off these cuffs!

00:53.042 --> 00:55.708
Think you can shut me up?

00:55.792 --> 00:59.125
Fuck you! Remove the cuffs, fag!

01:00.833 --> 01:03.208
I'll remember you, fags!

01:05.333 --> 01:06.625
Easy.

01:10.292 --> 01:12.917
Don't touch me. Raise your hands.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.500
I can walk alone.

01:14.500 --> 01:15.958
Fuck you, asshole!

01:17.250 --> 01:18.625
Where are you taking me?

01:19.292 --> 01:21.458
First, take off the handcuffs.

01:21.583 --> 01:25.125
Take them off or I'm not coming in.

01:25.167 --> 01:29.125
You think I'm stupid?
Take off the handcuffs!

01:43.083 --> 01:44.875
Malik, can you hear me?

01:45.833 --> 01:49.792
- Do you understand?
- I understand it's 6 years.

01:49.958 --> 01:52.167
Now you're an adult.
You'll be in a prison.

01:52.958 --> 01:54.500
You're among the adults.

01:58.500 --> 02:00.458
Sign here.

02:00.750 --> 02:03.917
- What's this?
- For legal aid.

02:04.292 --> 02:06.250
- Money?
- Money for me.

02:06.583 --> 02:08.625
So they pay me. Sign here.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.042
Money for you?

02:24.125 --> 02:25.625
Thank you.

03:20.208 --> 03:21.458
Raise your arms.

03:22.500 --> 03:23.458
Higher.

03:24.208 --> 03:26.417
Palms out.
Shake your hair.

03:27.125 --> 03:29.875
Open your mouth.
Stick out your tongue.

03:30.500 --> 03:31.542
Turn.

03:32.625 --> 03:35.167
The soles of your feet.
The other one.

03:35.833 --> 03:37.042
Bend over.

03:37.125 --> 03:38.042
Cough.

03:42.458 --> 03:46.125
Money is not allowed here.
You'll get it when you leave.

03:46.333 --> 03:51.542
Give him a uniform and shoes.
Rubbish. You can't wear them here.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.708
- Do you have a family?
- No, sir.

03:55.833 --> 03:58.083
- Somebody to send you money?
- No, sir.

03:58.417 --> 04:00.458
Friends or enemies in here?

04:01.417 --> 04:02.542
No, sir.

04:04.167 --> 04:08.042
You'll be in observation.
So we can evaluate you.

04:08.833 --> 04:10.250
We'll see how you adapt.

04:10.875 --> 04:12.667
Then you'll have a permanent cell.

04:13.833 --> 04:15.458
- Are you a practicing believer?
- What?

04:16.208 --> 04:17.292
Your religion.

04:18.458 --> 04:19.542
Will you pray?

04:20.542 --> 04:22.125
Any special diet?

04:24.125 --> 04:25.667
Nothing special, sir.

04:26.042 --> 04:27.000
Do you eat pork?

04:28.083 --> 04:29.292
No. Yes...

04:31.292 --> 04:34.042
How will you receive any money sent?

04:35.583 --> 04:36.708
I don't know.

04:36.792 --> 04:37.833
Want to work?

04:40.833 --> 04:44.750
- What do you do besides attacking
policemen? - I did nothing!

04:44.917 --> 04:47.000
Vocational training?
Anything else?

04:55.083 --> 04:56.708
Stand back, please.

06:18.542 --> 06:19.458
Boss!

06:56.125 --> 06:59.167
Are you new?
You're in the office.

07:00.042 --> 07:01.333
Did you get something from outside?

07:02.500 --> 07:06.833
- A mobile, drugs, pills?
- What the hell? I have nothing.

07:06.875 --> 07:09.125
Do you get checks?
Do you have friends outside?

07:10.292 --> 07:14.042
- What do you want?
- Your shoes. They're nice.

07:14.250 --> 07:16.333
Can I keep them?
Take my slippers.

07:16.417 --> 07:17.708
Fuck you.

07:23.208 --> 07:24.250
Faggot!

07:55.667 --> 07:56.708
Son of a bitch.

08:01.083 --> 08:03.333
To your cells. Closing time.

08:12.417 --> 08:13.833
Closing time.

08:28.750 --> 08:29.917
Line up.

08:36.458 --> 08:37.417
Cesar.

08:39.167 --> 08:40.250
Call Cesar.

08:46.333 --> 08:47.792
The guy on the right.

08:49.708 --> 08:54.542
- What's that dirty Arab doing here?
- Could be for the Farraldo trial.

09:09.625 --> 09:10.958
Luciani. Ward.

09:22.500 --> 09:24.250
Luciani. Consultation.

09:48.042 --> 09:49.208
So?

09:50.458 --> 09:52.625
They've brought him
for the Farraldo trial.

09:54.208 --> 09:57.750
His lawyer wants to negotiate.
Get a lesser sentence.

09:58.167 --> 10:00.542
He will stay until the trial.

10:01.875 --> 10:05.167
Jacky Marcaggi wants you to do him.

10:08.250 --> 10:11.000
- When is the trial?
- On the 14.

10:11.208 --> 10:14.458
In ten days? Not much time.

10:15.958 --> 10:18.833
- Does he suspect anything?
- The usual.

10:19.333 --> 10:22.625
Like any rat. He's asked for a
transfer to the Muslim section.

10:23.583 --> 10:27.292
And if left alone,
we lose our chance.

10:36.833 --> 10:42.917
Stays all day in the cell. Doesn't see
anyone. Never goes out. Doesn't eat.

10:44.042 --> 10:47.375
He requested block B,
with the Muslims.

10:50.292 --> 10:52.542
We have to get him
while he's in the cell.

10:52.958 --> 10:57.292
- Hit and run?
- We can't risk one of our own.

10:57.333 --> 11:01.625
Stay tuned. We'll find a
way. Any contact in block A?

11:01.792 --> 11:03.167
Just the porter.

11:05.625 --> 11:06.750
Open. Dinner!

11:08.625 --> 11:11.542
- The door must always be open.
- Yes, I know.

11:11.875 --> 11:15.333
- Nothing to eat? - No, just bread.
- Bread, then.

11:17.208 --> 11:18.458
The other.

11:21.208 --> 11:22.083
Bon appétit.

11:22.375 --> 11:23.875
- When is there mail?
- Tomorrow.

11:31.083 --> 11:32.625
- How you doing?
- Okay.

11:34.417 --> 11:35.500
Bread?

11:36.750 --> 11:37.750
Bon appétit.

12:08.667 --> 12:12.375
- What the fuck?
- I recognized you. We're neighbors.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.625
- What's your name?
- Yours?

12:17.083 --> 12:21.167
- Which block are you in?
- Do you know yours?

12:21.750 --> 12:22.750
B.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.667
Ask for the B.
It is for our brothers.

12:27.833 --> 12:31.833
Come closer.
I said come closer.

12:33.333 --> 12:37.542
You want hashish?
Yeah, hashish. Want some or not?

12:37.917 --> 12:39.875
But... I have no money.

12:40.375 --> 12:43.542
- We'll manage.
- What do you mean?

12:44.125 --> 12:46.708
I'll bribe a guard and you suck me.

12:47.083 --> 12:50.708
- What? - You suck me off.
- Fuck you, asshole!

12:50.792 --> 12:55.000
Me, suck? Mother fucker! Fuck you!

12:55.917 --> 12:58.542
Shut up! Faggot!

13:49.083 --> 13:50.167
Are you okay?

13:51.417 --> 13:52.667
I found it in the yard.

14:28.125 --> 14:29.333
This way.

14:32.667 --> 14:36.625
- How old are you?
- 19. Why?

14:36.667 --> 14:40.833
- Don't look at me. Look at this guy.
- Look at me.

14:41.125 --> 14:44.875
I heard you got 6 years.
It's a long time.

14:45.292 --> 14:48.125
Think you can last
without protection?

14:48.583 --> 14:49.750
I'll manage.

14:53.208 --> 14:54.917
- What do you want?
- To protect you.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.875
- Do you speak Arabic?
- Sure.

14:58.292 --> 14:59.875
The guy in the shower yesterday...

15:02.125 --> 15:03.125
You know him?

15:04.208 --> 15:05.417
What did he want?

15:06.000 --> 15:07.250
To talk.

15:08.792 --> 15:10.083
I told you not to look at me.

15:11.417 --> 15:12.625
I want you to go on with him.

15:13.542 --> 15:15.708
Get close to him.
Become his friend.

15:17.583 --> 15:18.417
Why?

15:19.583 --> 15:22.500
Because you're going to kill him.
Let him go.

15:23.625 --> 15:24.583
Come closer.

15:25.667 --> 15:26.750
Closer. Near to him.

15:29.875 --> 15:31.125
You can do it.

15:32.833 --> 15:34.375
You're not alone.
We'll help.

15:36.708 --> 15:37.958
But remember something.

15:39.167 --> 15:44.000
Now that you know, either you kill him,
or I'll kill you.

15:45.292 --> 15:46.542
Go on, now.

15:49.500 --> 15:50.458
Understood?

15:51.250 --> 15:53.250
Kill him and be quiet. Understood?

15:56.708 --> 15:58.167
I can't kill anyone.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.750
- Yes?
- Can I speak with the director?

16:26.250 --> 16:28.875
There is a procedure.
First you have to ask for an interview.

16:33.250 --> 16:34.167
The guard...

16:38.917 --> 16:41.208
Can I talk to the guard now?

16:41.958 --> 16:43.375
- Why?
- I need to.

16:45.167 --> 16:46.333
I'll check.

16:59.500 --> 17:00.583
I have a problem, sir.

17:18.708 --> 17:24.875
We give the orders. What do you want?
Nothing? Shut up and do as you're told.

17:51.167 --> 17:54.250
Reyeb is careful.
He won't accept easily.

17:56.333 --> 17:57.333
Are you listening?

17:58.083 --> 18:00.708
- Once again. Are you paying attention?
- Yes

18:01.583 --> 18:06.167
It won't be easy.
You can't carry anything.

18:06.542 --> 18:10.125
Talk to him... naturally.
About your mothers, visits...

18:10.333 --> 18:11.250
Normal talk.

18:13.083 --> 18:14.000
You cut here.

18:17.625 --> 18:18.958
You hit him on the balls.

18:24.083 --> 18:25.583
You grab his shoulder.

18:28.583 --> 18:30.792
You get up and do it. Understood?

18:36.583 --> 18:38.417
Can you give me some hash?

18:41.292 --> 18:42.375
I can't hear you.

18:44.542 --> 18:45.750
Some hash.

18:47.333 --> 18:49.417
Ok. I'll talk to the dealer.

18:49.958 --> 18:50.958
Move away.

18:51.625 --> 18:52.667
What?

18:52.875 --> 18:54.417
Move away, I said.

18:55.875 --> 18:57.000
Turn.

19:00.792 --> 19:02.083
Turn.

19:04.625 --> 19:05.875
Raise your hands.

20:31.792 --> 20:32.875
Guard!

20:52.458 --> 20:53.500
Is it that one?

20:58.708 --> 21:01.333
- El Djebena, move.
- Give us a minute.

21:10.833 --> 21:13.042
Problems at work?

21:15.083 --> 21:17.458
- What did he do?
- He hit a guy.

21:18.625 --> 21:19.875
Did you hit a guy?

21:21.667 --> 21:22.750
What did he do to you?

21:24.833 --> 21:25.708
Nothing?

21:27.417 --> 21:29.250
Nothing and you hit him?

21:31.500 --> 21:32.750
You know what I think?

21:34.125 --> 21:35.875
You did that to get caught.

21:36.917 --> 21:38.125
Am I wrong?

21:38.792 --> 21:41.833
You think we can't get to you
to do what we want?

21:43.042 --> 21:44.167
Is that it?

21:47.792 --> 21:48.958
Bitch!

21:50.083 --> 21:51.333
Piece of shit!

21:51.958 --> 21:53.042
Asshole!

21:53.417 --> 21:54.375
Enough, Cesar!

21:56.750 --> 21:59.625
Stop, Cesar! Enough!

22:09.417 --> 22:11.083
He'll bleed a lot, so be careful.

22:13.167 --> 22:14.750
Check the soles of your shoes.

22:16.875 --> 22:18.333
Leave the blade in his hand.

22:22.833 --> 22:24.667
Your turn. You're the girl.

22:34.667 --> 22:36.167
Fast or it won't work.

22:48.792 --> 22:49.583
Come on.

22:57.625 --> 22:58.708
That's right. Fine.

23:46.292 --> 23:47.458
Come on.

24:11.625 --> 24:15.500
Come in. Don't move.

24:22.042 --> 24:25.083
Raise your hands.
I said hands up.

24:27.583 --> 24:29.292
Sorry, but not everyone
is a friend here.

24:35.583 --> 24:36.833
I decide.

24:39.958 --> 24:41.167
Sit.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.083
On the bed.
On the bed I said.

24:47.250 --> 24:51.000
You want something?
Water? Coffee?

24:51.625 --> 24:52.625
Coffee.

25:02.292 --> 25:05.625
- Are you interested in this?
- What? - Books.

25:06.875 --> 25:10.250
- You want to read?
- I don't know.

25:10.375 --> 25:11.375
Don't know what?

25:13.792 --> 25:14.833
You can't read, right?

25:16.875 --> 25:19.917
it's never too late.
There is a school in prison.

25:20.833 --> 25:22.083
You can learn here.

25:24.083 --> 25:25.833
Sugar?

25:29.417 --> 25:31.458
The idea is to get out of here
a little smarter.

25:53.708 --> 25:54.667
Here.

26:02.667 --> 26:06.125
I've seen you in the yard.
Always alone.

26:06.417 --> 26:11.250
Always wearing the same clothes.
Don't you have friends here? None?

26:14.167 --> 26:17.625
I'm just passing by. I won't stay.

26:18.375 --> 26:22.542
I can leave you some books.
You can learn to read.

26:25.667 --> 26:27.250
Shut up!

26:36.375 --> 26:38.292
Are you okay?

26:42.083 --> 26:43.000
Are you okay?

26:45.375 --> 26:46.375
What are you doing?

26:48.292 --> 26:49.250
Come.

29:55.125 --> 29:56.542
From Cesar Luciani.

29:57.625 --> 29:59.083
You are now under his protection.

30:42.083 --> 30:44.542
I have seen your profile.
Almost empty.

30:44.958 --> 30:46.042
Are you interested?

30:47.958 --> 30:49.958
Why didn't you fill it out, then?

30:51.167 --> 30:54.000
- I don't understand.
- Want to learn?

30:56.750 --> 30:59.792
You wrote your name, so
you can write a little.

31:00.958 --> 31:01.875
A little.

31:02.083 --> 31:05.250
- When did you leave school?
- At age 11.

31:06.708 --> 31:08.958
Can you write "In" and "out"?

31:13.083 --> 31:14.625
Is your mother tongue French?

31:15.958 --> 31:18.625
Did you talk in French
or Arabic to your parents?

31:21.667 --> 31:24.958
- I wasn't raised by them.
- Did you speak French or Arabic first?

31:26.417 --> 31:27.542
Both.

31:29.375 --> 31:33.250
- Where was your school?
- A Youth Center.

31:34.292 --> 31:38.125
There is a word with "a"
which is not pronounced "a".

31:38.708 --> 31:39.792
The fourth.

31:40.333 --> 31:44.375
- The fourth. What is the word?
- "Dans".

31:45.292 --> 31:50.417
Go to the second word.
The second word...

31:50.542 --> 31:52.167
"Canard".

31:52.583 --> 31:57.000
This word has two syllables.

31:58.292 --> 31:59.250
Ca...

31:59.917 --> 32:00.792
...nard.

32:01.292 --> 32:05.500
Repeat, separating the syllables.

32:07.583 --> 32:08.583
Very good.

32:10.167 --> 32:16.417
In the first syllable, "ca", is the "a"
at the beginning or the end?

33:40.542 --> 33:42.208
Happy birthday, brother.

33:46.375 --> 33:50.042
1 year

34:29.750 --> 34:31.583
Stop it!

34:33.083 --> 34:34.750
Have you no shame?

35:00.583 --> 35:02.292
Who are the leaders?

35:03.625 --> 35:05.208
- You know them?
- Who?

35:05.333 --> 35:06.583
The Muslims.

35:11.875 --> 35:16.500
These fucking Arabs! Dogs
at least screw in silence.

35:30.750 --> 35:31.750
3.40 Euros.

35:32.167 --> 35:33.417
How much is that?

35:34.458 --> 35:35.792
In francs?

35:36.208 --> 35:37.458
Money is money.

35:38.500 --> 35:39.583
20 francs?

35:40.875 --> 35:42.167
Pass the biscuits.

35:42.708 --> 35:46.583
- Can you buy me something?
- You cheated me the last time.

35:46.625 --> 35:48.250
- Not true.
- Ask him.

35:48.458 --> 35:52.458
- What do you want?
- Soap, cereal and Coca-Cola.

35:52.500 --> 35:53.917
- No Coke.
- Why?

35:54.042 --> 35:55.667
Not with my card.

35:55.833 --> 35:58.125
- But it's for me.
- Don't bust my balls!

35:59.000 --> 36:02.625
Stop sponging.
Sponge your own people.

36:03.250 --> 36:07.250
Or your friends out there.
It pisses me off that you're here.

36:07.333 --> 36:08.500
He's not one of us.

36:09.625 --> 36:14.667
Let him clean if you want. But he's
finished, so out he goes. Arab shit!

36:15.333 --> 36:16.792
Have you finished? Out.

36:52.292 --> 36:53.375
Fuck them!

36:54.958 --> 36:57.542
Fuck you.
Arab shit!

37:10.625 --> 37:12.000
How much you got left?

37:14.750 --> 37:16.208
Two more...

37:17.375 --> 37:19.125
3 years.

37:19.875 --> 37:20.833
What about you?

37:23.458 --> 37:24.708
"Rabia": Rage.

37:25.500 --> 37:27.625
"Rabid": furious.

37:33.458 --> 37:34.708
"Raccia"...

37:35.208 --> 37:36.458
To caw.

37:37.417 --> 37:38.625
Who cares?

37:38.958 --> 37:40.542
"Radica": Root.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.083
Electricity is like water
in a circuit.

38:04.167 --> 38:10.042
Whatever the tube diameter
the flow is the same. Same here.

38:10.375 --> 38:13.542
The current remains constant
1, 2 and 3.

38:13.583 --> 38:18.917
You have to change "he" for "us".
Understand? "He ate before. "

38:19.333 --> 38:20.500
"We ate earlier".

38:20.583 --> 38:24.917
the "we" is fine, but " to eat"...
What is the participle?

38:29.792 --> 38:32.083
We had eaten.

38:32.542 --> 38:35.958
Okay. Now in the indefinite past.

38:37.000 --> 38:41.583
- We... ate.
- Do people talk this way?

38:41.625 --> 38:43.708
It's complicated. I don't,
but they use it.

38:45.417 --> 38:48.500
One day I saw an ad.
For a security guard.

38:48.542 --> 38:51.667
I had no dog. I bought
a second-hand one.

38:52.500 --> 38:55.458
In my ignorance I bought a Rottweiler.

38:56.125 --> 38:59.333
You know how they are?
His name was Tyson.

38:59.375 --> 39:02.542
He came with a name: Tyson.
He was huge!

39:04.542 --> 39:07.917
You see this?
That was his butt.

39:07.917 --> 39:11.417
His poops were bigger than mine.

39:11.833 --> 39:15.583
I went to work at a supermarket.

39:15.958 --> 39:21.000
I left the dog inside and
went to smoke a cigarette.

39:21.500 --> 39:24.958
When I tried to enter again,
it was impossible.

39:25.417 --> 39:28.917
- He didn't recognize me.
- Your own dog?

39:28.958 --> 39:32.417
He was mad. Tyson was a psychotic.

39:32.458 --> 39:35.833
I went in and he pounced.

39:36.333 --> 39:39.792
I panicked and pulled out the gun.
He grabbed me like that.

39:39.833 --> 39:46.000
I sprayed him with gas. No effect.
I ran away scared. What to do?

39:46.750 --> 39:48.208
I left him inside.

39:49.417 --> 39:55.458
Three hours later the employees arrived.
I didn't know they used the back door.

39:55.708 --> 40:00.500
The dog had a field day.
He mauled them all.

40:03.625 --> 40:06.083
He was like Karim in Block B.

40:11.083 --> 40:13.458
- What are you doing here?
- Returning books.

40:13.500 --> 40:15.583
Out. You come with me.

40:18.542 --> 40:21.833
- Why are you with him?
- He's a brother. - He's a Corsican!

40:24.333 --> 40:25.917
Dirty bastard!

40:25.958 --> 40:29.208
- Pig!
- You call me pig?

40:30.958 --> 40:32.042
Who is the pig?

40:32.792 --> 40:33.792
Me a pig?

40:35.083 --> 40:36.250
Me a pig?

40:36.292 --> 40:37.625
Let me go!

40:41.917 --> 40:42.875
This is not right!

40:42.958 --> 40:44.625
This isn't Corsica.

40:45.542 --> 40:47.167
You are being disrespectful.

40:54.417 --> 40:55.250
El Djebena!

40:57.792 --> 41:00.167
Tell your boss I have to
introduce a new one.

41:06.042 --> 41:10.000
- You bring the papers?
- They haven't arrived. I bring clothes.

41:10.708 --> 41:14.042
- Make coffee.
- For everyone?

41:15.958 --> 41:17.417
Did you see Ilbanez?

41:18.167 --> 41:20.792
He'll come later with the new prisoner.

41:34.833 --> 41:35.833
Luciani.

41:35.917 --> 41:37.083
Vettori.

41:37.583 --> 41:39.417
- Antarro.
- Santi.

41:39.708 --> 41:41.500
- Ceccaldi.
- Profundi.

41:41.542 --> 41:42.583
Mosconi.

41:42.625 --> 41:43.625
Pilicci.

41:43.667 --> 41:45.542
- Valpato.
- Corleoni.

41:46.250 --> 41:47.292
El Djebena.

41:56.667 --> 42:02.333
The Minister said that Corsicans will
serve their sentences closer to home.

42:02.375 --> 42:05.250
The law will be published on Sunday.

42:05.292 --> 42:11.500
This is due to the revaluation of
political prisoners sponsored by Sarkozy

42:12.083 --> 42:16.583
Currently there are no comments
from the Corsican National Front.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
Cesar!

42:28.542 --> 42:29.625
Are you there?

42:31.375 --> 42:36.125
Did you hear the news?
When are we leaving?

42:36.167 --> 42:40.917
- When the bill is passed.
- Soon?

42:43.250 --> 42:44.792
No idea.

42:48.750 --> 42:50.917
Luciani. For Mr. Sampiero.

43:00.750 --> 43:06.417
I can tell you who won't benefit.
Not you, you know that.

43:07.833 --> 43:11.542
Neither Pilicci, Antarr nor Prof.
You fucked up bad.

43:13.250 --> 43:16.375
"Fuck up" wasn't used back then.

43:17.583 --> 43:20.792
Santi and Vettori are expecting
conditional freedom, so...

43:24.208 --> 43:29.667
- Are you saying I'm going to die alone
here? - Don't talk like that.

43:33.042 --> 43:35.625
You're not alone.
You have strength outside.

43:38.458 --> 43:39.708
And here?

43:41.458 --> 43:42.583
Here!

43:42.917 --> 43:48.583
Guard! I already pinned three.
This is disrespectful. Seriously.

43:48.917 --> 43:50.708
Do you work for the Imam Moussab?

43:50.958 --> 43:54.417
He helps to rehabilitate sick prisoners.
He got me a job.

43:54.792 --> 43:58.667
I'm doing some work for him.
Some day I'll have a real job.

43:59.375 --> 44:02.167
- Are you sick?
- That's why I got a pardon.

44:02.583 --> 44:03.667
Are you leaving this place?

44:07.958 --> 44:12.375
- Do you have AIDS? - Of course not!
Don't say that. Are you crazy?

44:18.375 --> 44:21.625
- What have you got?
- Cancer of the testicles.

44:23.083 --> 44:27.667
- Cancer in the balls?
- Don't shout. Don't advertise it!

44:27.667 --> 44:30.625
- Besides, I'm cured.
- Are you better then?

44:31.000 --> 44:32.667
Thank God.

44:34.208 --> 44:35.125
Does it hurt?

44:35.750 --> 44:37.208
No.

44:37.250 --> 44:40.333
Chemotherapy is what hurts.
You lose your hair.

44:40.667 --> 44:43.333
You feel like you're 80.
You're always tired.

44:43.750 --> 44:47.833
But thank God it's over.
I can even have kids.

44:51.917 --> 44:55.292
- Here, for your balls, bro.
- It's welcome.

44:57.292 --> 44:59.917
- What's your sign?
- Cancer.

45:00.333 --> 45:04.375
Just kidding. I'm Aries.

45:10.208 --> 45:11.667
See you, Cesar!

45:12.333 --> 45:13.708
Take care, friend!

45:15.500 --> 45:17.750
We won't forget you, Cesar!

45:18.833 --> 45:22.125
Be strong, Volfoni!
See you in Bastia!

46:14.458 --> 46:16.250
Got your phone?

46:31.500 --> 46:33.583
Why don't you leave it with someone?

46:44.250 --> 46:45.458
I speak Corsican.

46:51.375 --> 46:52.750
I speak your language.

46:56.292 --> 47:01.125
Did you understand me when
I was on the phone?

47:01.167 --> 47:03.125
You were talking to a layer.

47:04.083 --> 47:05.458
A what?

47:07.625 --> 47:08.792
A lawyer?

47:11.833 --> 47:15.583
- Who taught you?
- You... and the others.

47:15.625 --> 47:20.833
- Looking, listening.
- You mean spying?

47:20.875 --> 47:24.083
I didn't spy on you.
I've learned by listening.

47:24.125 --> 47:30.292
You were here. If you weren't spying,
what were you doing? Having fun?

47:31.583 --> 47:34.833
If I had been having fun,
I wouldn't have told you.

47:34.875 --> 47:38.792
Why are you tellimg me, then?
Because the others have gone?

47:40.375 --> 47:45.500
Look at me, Arab. Because
the others are gone, right?

47:45.542 --> 47:46.667
Yes

47:49.208 --> 47:51.375
Does anyone else know?

47:58.708 --> 48:00.500
It has a life of its own.

48:01.292 --> 48:04.708
Come sit.
Get your ass here.

48:16.333 --> 48:17.667
Keep it.

48:19.583 --> 48:21.458
Keep it, but don't use it.

48:22.375 --> 48:27.542
Not everyone is like Ilbanez.
If they find it, you're fucked.

48:28.875 --> 48:31.833
Go on with the cleaning,
washing clothes...

48:33.833 --> 48:37.208
Ilbanez will transfer you to the
adjacent cell.

48:38.208 --> 48:40.083
I'll have them make you a porter.

48:40.667 --> 48:45.292
You'll get paid, you can buy stuff
and go anywhere.

48:47.125 --> 48:51.083
You'll be my eyes and ears.

48:52.750 --> 48:56.375
- What about the others?
- Who, my friends?

48:56.417 --> 48:58.917
Watch them as well.

49:04.083 --> 49:06.583
Are you happy?
You look worried.

49:07.500 --> 49:10.375
- I'm fine.
- Well, say so.

50:23.167 --> 50:27.458
eyes and ears

50:39.417 --> 50:44.042
- What did Cesar say?
- The lawyer will help your brother.

50:44.125 --> 50:46.750
He doesn't give a shit about my brother.

50:47.083 --> 50:50.417
My wife left him 10 messages.
He never answered.

50:51.667 --> 50:56.083
As with Santi and Castelli.
No news. Nothing.

50:56.833 --> 50:58.125
Play.

51:52.958 --> 51:53.875
Did you masturbate?

51:53.917 --> 51:57.292
Jordi, the Gypsy
I like porn movies in castles.

51:57.333 --> 52:01.750
The girls are prettier, cleaner.
How many times did you come?

52:03.458 --> 52:08.042
- When?
- Fuck off. Who cares? Give me that.

52:08.292 --> 52:12.583
Remember with the driver?
With his dick pointing to her pussy.

52:12.625 --> 52:15.500
He fucks her from behind
and stuffs her ass.

52:17.333 --> 52:22.667
And she sucks off the blonde's husband!
Then she goes for a walk with her dog.

52:27.417 --> 52:32.333
I'll give you the rest tomorrow.
Do you make a lot dealing?

52:32.625 --> 52:36.333
No. Enough for shopping and my drugs.

52:36.792 --> 52:38.125
To purchase...

52:41.167 --> 52:43.000
Want to work with me?

52:46.292 --> 52:48.250
I don't understand your game.

52:48.292 --> 52:50.917
- It's not a game.
- You work for the Corsicans.

52:51.417 --> 52:52.625
I work for me.

52:53.125 --> 52:56.875
You don't know anybody in Block C.
You don't sell to just anyone.

53:08.042 --> 53:09.500
What will you do after you get out?

53:14.583 --> 53:19.292
- When you leave, what will you do?
- Don't know. Do you?

53:20.542 --> 53:24.542
- Same as here, but big.
- Hash?

53:25.458 --> 53:26.958
Yes, hash.

53:28.708 --> 53:32.667
But in large quantities.
Marbella-Paris, 3 cars.

53:32.875 --> 53:35.000
600 kilos per trip.

53:37.875 --> 53:39.208
You don't believe me?

53:40.625 --> 53:43.667
I was just trying to imagine 600 kilos.

53:48.417 --> 53:49.542
Something like this.

53:51.417 --> 53:53.333
You see nothing beyond.

54:35.458 --> 54:36.833
Got it.

54:56.667 --> 55:02.417
They died for no reason!
You killed them!

55:35.167 --> 55:36.250
Do you still need me?

55:39.875 --> 55:43.750
- Do you know my business?
- You told me to stay out. - Come on...

55:44.250 --> 55:48.125
I don't know. Things with the Italians.
Casinos in the south.

55:50.375 --> 55:51.500
What's wrong?

55:54.875 --> 55:59.292
- How long will you be in here?
- 3 years. Minus time for good behavior

55:59.333 --> 56:00.542
You did half, right?

56:02.875 --> 56:08.083
- You can get furloughs. Did you request
them? - No, that's for my lawyer.

56:08.125 --> 56:11.375
- Has he requested them?
- Why do you ask?

56:15.208 --> 56:20.125
Ask for parole. I'll get you
priority treatment.

56:20.958 --> 56:23.125
Meanwhile, you can get furloughs.

56:24.333 --> 56:28.792
You go out for me, come back, I'll pay.
What do you say?

56:29.625 --> 56:34.042
- What's the risk?
- No risk. The risk is in here.

56:48.250 --> 56:53.708
As soon as the judge considers the
case, he'll ask for more information,

56:53.750 --> 56:56.875
and answer in 5 or 6 months.

56:56.917 --> 57:00.042
I mean an answer,
not necessarily positive.

57:03.000 --> 57:06.333
Do you have a card with your number?

57:13.417 --> 57:15.708
I'll telephone a lawyer,
the name's Sampiero.

57:15.750 --> 57:20.167
Give him what he asks.
Do as he says.

57:20.375 --> 57:24.125
Present the case as soon as he
prepares it. He'll pay you.

57:24.958 --> 57:29.167
- What about the trial?
- Don't worry. He'll explain.

57:38.083 --> 57:41.625
Who is he? Who are these guys?
Thugs?

57:41.708 --> 57:46.958
You never told me about it. Do you know
I can get kicked out of here?

57:47.042 --> 57:51.917
- It's not what I need.
- It's too late. You're in this.

57:53.917 --> 57:56.667
From now on you're a model prisoner.

57:56.708 --> 58:02.167
You're a porter.
Be the best one.

58:02.708 --> 58:06.917
Study for your exams.
Antarro will keep the phone.

58:07.292 --> 58:12.208
- He'll suspect something.
- I'll tell him you pissed me off.

58:21.583 --> 58:25.417
Peace be with you. I was glad
to receive your letter.

58:25.458 --> 58:30.583
In the first place to hear from you.
And also to see your progress.

58:30.625 --> 58:35.042
You write like a professional and I'm
glad. At least I served some purpose.

58:35.625 --> 58:39.042
Now I can tell you
it was not easy.

58:39.583 --> 58:42.750
About your request,
I'll see what I can do.

58:43.208 --> 58:46.333
I'll send a request to visit you.

58:46.958 --> 58:48.167
Life here isn't easy.

58:50.125 --> 58:54.667
I will avoid saying that it's better
over there, but honestly it's tough.

58:54.708 --> 58:59.208
Djamila has a part-time job
and it's hell with the kid.

59:00.250 --> 59:06.042
Imam Moussab's Center got
me a job as an operator.

59:06.083 --> 59:09.333
I get paid shit, but I
keep quiet and hang on.

59:09.750 --> 59:12.250
Keep your head up!
Your brother, Riyad.

59:14.167 --> 59:16.250
For the girls, Martine,
and for the boys, Jean-Pierre.

59:16.708 --> 59:20.333
- A question.
- What's your name? - Ryad Mnaili.

59:20.375 --> 59:24.833
You are Jean-Pierre. You already made
a mistake. Only two are allowed.

59:24.875 --> 59:27.917
Be careful, put your hand
under his head.

59:32.333 --> 59:36.167
Issam... this is Malik.
He's your godfather.

59:48.125 --> 59:51.583
It's a garage. The owner
agrees to hire you.

59:51.625 --> 59:54.042
He'll meet you in your day off.

59:55.208 --> 1:00:00.917
It's the guy who fixes the Imam's cars.
He's already hired other guys.

1:00:02.750 --> 1:00:04.667
Do you know what you do for them?

1:00:06.125 --> 1:00:07.458
Does it bother you?

1:00:08.750 --> 1:00:13.000
I go out and they pay me. If it's risky
for you, just tell me.

1:00:13.042 --> 1:00:19.250
Risky? Are you crazy? I'm
rehabilitated. Aren't we rehabilitated?

1:00:23.458 --> 1:00:27.125
Outside of Paris there are radars.
Go slowly.

1:00:27.542 --> 1:00:30.542
Suddenly... the car breaks down.

1:00:31.042 --> 1:00:34.458
It skids a bit. Where?

1:00:34.458 --> 1:00:38.875
Near a gas station.
The guys get off and push.

1:00:38.917 --> 1:00:43.292
Guess who shows up to help them?
Come on, guess.

1:00:43.375 --> 1:00:44.833
- Who?
- Guess!

1:00:44.875 --> 1:00:48.250
- I have no idea.
- The Customs guy, the Customs!

1:00:49.917 --> 1:00:52.583
100 kilos.
They confiscated 100 kilos.

1:01:23.333 --> 1:01:27.917
- What is the point then?
- You'll know. You know what I want.

1:01:27.958 --> 1:01:31.417
This is a business.
Don't you smoke my hash every day?

1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:36.000
Are they going to screw me for
your booty? For some smokes?

1:01:36.917 --> 1:01:39.333
- Fuck you!
- Back to your cell.

1:01:39.375 --> 1:01:40.917
- My dessert, sir!
- Get inside!

1:01:45.792 --> 1:01:48.208
What does the accusation say?

1:01:49.250 --> 1:01:54.958
In view of the case, I have no objection
to grant furloughs to Mr. El Djebena.

1:01:55.625 --> 1:02:01.167
But he can't be out more than 12 hours,
and he has to go to the police station.

1:02:01.750 --> 1:02:04.875
Thank you. Do you have anything to add?

1:02:08.708 --> 1:02:10.125
Let the prisoner in.

1:02:10.167 --> 1:02:14.167
Hello, Mr. El Djebena.

1:02:15.167 --> 1:02:20.583
I authorize a furlough. You'll leave
at 7 am and must return by 7 pm.

1:02:44.458 --> 1:02:48.750
That's disgusting.
Do something.

1:03:23.125 --> 1:03:24.167
The door.

1:03:26.208 --> 1:03:28.167
- Have a good day.
- Good day, sir.

1:04:17.083 --> 1:04:19.125
Roll up the window.

1:04:30.208 --> 1:04:35.375
Your phone. That's my number.
So you can find me.

1:04:36.667 --> 1:04:41.583
Want to meet Djamila?
She's alone.

1:04:42.292 --> 1:04:44.167
Do you have a TV in your cell?

1:04:57.083 --> 1:04:59.750
- For a day?
- Until 7.

1:05:43.917 --> 1:05:47.708
- How is Cesar?
- He was fine yesterday.

1:05:49.083 --> 1:05:51.583
You'll leave this someplace for us.

1:05:52.417 --> 1:05:54.542
- What then?
- You return.

1:05:55.625 --> 1:05:59.583
- Cesar says you don't ask questions.
- Cesar says you'll pay me.

1:06:02.792 --> 1:06:05.000
Later, all right?

1:06:07.208 --> 1:06:11.375
- What do we do?
- Wait until he returns.

1:06:11.625 --> 1:06:13.583
What if something goes wrong?

1:06:15.708 --> 1:06:17.000
Who cares?

1:06:31.917 --> 1:06:33.667
In the middle of nowhere.

1:06:36.125 --> 1:06:40.708
There, to the right. Here, here,
to the right. Get closer.

1:06:46.708 --> 1:06:48.500
There's a car in front.

1:07:11.792 --> 1:07:15.958
The messenger's an Arab!
Do I let him in?

1:07:17.583 --> 1:07:18.500
What the fuck?

1:07:37.500 --> 1:07:40.667
- Who are you?
- Malik El Djebena.

1:07:40.708 --> 1:07:43.208
- Who sent you?
- Luciani.

1:07:44.125 --> 1:07:47.208
Luciani is in jail!
Who are you?

1:07:47.875 --> 1:07:49.167
I'm doing time with him.

1:07:50.458 --> 1:07:54.208
- Are you in jail or out?
- One day leave.

1:07:54.292 --> 1:08:00.458
- Do you work for those bums?
- Don't work for anyone. I work for me.

1:08:03.250 --> 1:08:05.708
- Everything in there?
- Yes

1:08:08.167 --> 1:08:10.792
- Can I go now?
- Have you forgotten something?

1:08:11.542 --> 1:08:13.167
You don't know about the exchange?

1:08:27.417 --> 1:08:28.792
Let's go.

1:08:46.208 --> 1:08:47.208
Shut up.

1:08:52.083 --> 1:08:54.042
Call Cesar...

1:08:56.417 --> 1:08:58.833
You have to call Cesar.

1:09:17.625 --> 1:09:20.417
Hello. It's me.
I have a problem.

1:09:20.458 --> 1:09:23.208
I'm not alone.
I'm with Santi.

1:09:55.583 --> 1:10:01.708
- Calle de Madrid. They're waiting.
- We gotta go. Can you go back alone?

1:10:02.500 --> 1:10:07.167
- Any message for Cesar? - I'll
call him. Be sure to arrive on time.

1:10:07.500 --> 1:10:10.083
Maybe we'll work together again.

1:10:12.792 --> 1:10:14.708
- What?
- You know...

1:12:14.750 --> 1:12:15.833
God!

1:12:17.250 --> 1:12:19.000
- How much?
- 25 kilos.

1:12:23.583 --> 1:12:24.833
Take this too.

1:12:28.042 --> 1:12:29.000
5,000.

1:12:31.458 --> 1:12:36.917
€ 5,000... and 25 kilos of hash?
All in a day?

1:12:37.750 --> 1:12:40.458
We have guys to keep it and sell.
We'll supply them.

1:12:41.500 --> 1:12:45.875
We use convoys and buy from
the source. The Gypsy has contacts.

1:12:45.917 --> 1:12:49.375
We need three large cars.
Paris-Marbella in one night.

1:12:50.792 --> 1:12:54.500
The first car to explore.
The second carries the load.

1:12:54.542 --> 1:12:56.708
The third car as an escort.

1:12:57.292 --> 1:12:59.917
They stay in contact by phone all night.

1:13:00.875 --> 1:13:03.000
Each car has an exit.

1:13:03.417 --> 1:13:07.375
- Wait, I've never done this before.
- So what's the problem?

1:13:07.375 --> 1:13:09.083
None.

1:13:10.708 --> 1:13:15.917
You focus on the city, I do the prison.
I'll make deals with leaving prisoners.

1:13:16.708 --> 1:13:20.250
Jordi knows a trucker
who delivers to jails.

1:13:21.375 --> 1:13:24.500
We invest half the money. We divide
the rest by 3. You, me and the Gypsy.

1:13:25.167 --> 1:13:26.375
Okay.

1:13:26.583 --> 1:13:30.500
Put a part in my account.
The rest we'll see.

1:13:31.417 --> 1:13:33.750
- What time is it?
- 6.45.

1:13:35.708 --> 1:13:39.375
Let me tell you something.

1:13:39.917 --> 1:13:41.875
Come out whenever you want!

1:13:46.042 --> 1:13:47.875
- Be careful.
- You too.

1:13:51.167 --> 1:13:53.000
El Djebena Malik.
35-114T.

1:13:57.167 --> 1:13:59.375
- How was the test?
- Car repairs.

1:13:59.417 --> 1:14:02.333
- Do you like mechanics?
- Yes, definitely.

1:14:03.458 --> 1:14:04.750
I'm in rehab.

1:14:05.583 --> 1:14:06.667
Bend over.

1:14:07.708 --> 1:14:08.583
Cough.

1:14:10.833 --> 1:14:14.625
- Sampiero said we could do it again.
- What do you think?

1:14:14.667 --> 1:14:17.833
- It's legal.
- You see?

1:14:19.333 --> 1:14:24.625
- Who did you see after Sampiero?
- The friend who got me the garage.

1:14:25.125 --> 1:14:26.708
Any problems?

1:14:29.042 --> 1:14:34.042
I'll make myself clear. Your
furloughs are mine. Period.

1:14:34.333 --> 1:14:38.167
- Here I am still your "Arab"?
- Yes, you do the dirty work.

1:14:49.875 --> 1:14:54.375
Put your names on the
top right and fold it.

1:14:54.833 --> 1:14:59.625
You have one hour for French.
Then we continue with Economics.

1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:03.083
- Do we write here?
- Yes, directly on the test sheet.

1:15:10.792 --> 1:15:12.667
ECONOMICS

1:15:39.083 --> 1:15:40.083
You!

1:15:40.125 --> 1:15:43.667
I've heard about your mother.

1:16:08.542 --> 1:16:12.750
Gentlemen, go back.
We'll do the Economics test.

1:16:16.792 --> 1:16:19.500
- El Djebena.
- Good morning.

1:16:22.542 --> 1:16:24.792
- And the batteries?
- Large ones.

1:16:43.333 --> 1:16:45.083
- Malik.
- Sophie.

1:17:17.417 --> 1:17:20.208
Am I crazy or do they multiply?

1:17:21.750 --> 1:17:24.042
Soon the carpets will come out.

1:17:25.458 --> 1:17:30.208
We used to control the court.
Good thing they're dumb.

1:17:33.875 --> 1:17:39.375
If they'd stop thinking with
their balls, they'd evolve more.

1:17:41.083 --> 1:17:44.708
You should get closer
to see what's going on.

1:17:45.375 --> 1:17:46.708
I don't understand.

1:17:48.458 --> 1:17:50.000
What don't you understand?

1:17:52.667 --> 1:17:57.292
- Want me to get a beating?
- Why would they beat you?

1:17:57.458 --> 1:18:03.625
- Are you crazy? To them I'm a Corsican.
- What? Their eyes are blinded by shit.

1:18:16.125 --> 1:18:21.917
Sends some guards to mingle with them.
They will eat from your hand.

1:18:23.583 --> 1:18:25.417
Good thinking.

1:18:27.208 --> 1:18:30.167
Just another Arab
thinking with his balls.

1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:10.167
YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE

1:19:23.583 --> 1:19:27.750
Let me introduce you to some friends.
The man in Marbella.

1:19:28.292 --> 1:19:30.417
- This is Khalid!
- Your brother.

1:19:32.750 --> 1:19:34.542
This is Mishka!

1:19:35.167 --> 1:19:38.667
This is Damien. And here is Olivier.
Say hello to Malik.

1:19:39.083 --> 1:19:43.417
- What's your name?
- My name's Fernanda. And I love cocks.

1:19:49.625 --> 1:19:50.667
Marbella!

1:19:55.875 --> 1:20:02.083
There, in Block C. What are the
Muslims doing? Smuggling? Drugs?

1:20:02.667 --> 1:20:07.125
- They do their own things.
- Really? You get nothing?

1:20:09.625 --> 1:20:15.667
Don't you think it would be nice
to send a pair of strong guys?

1:20:15.708 --> 1:20:19.792
- Press them a little bit.
- Why press them?

1:20:20.167 --> 1:20:26.417
Why? To show them who's boss,
which hand they have to kiss.

1:20:26.917 --> 1:20:28.500
Isn't it obvious?

1:20:30.083 --> 1:20:34.750
Before you were 20. Now you're 5.
Can't you see the difference?

1:20:37.792 --> 1:20:43.958
- What kind of difference?
- I can't do for 5 what I did for 20.

1:20:46.042 --> 1:20:51.292
If you can do nothing what good are you?
Want a transfer? I'll speak to Marcaggi.

1:20:51.292 --> 1:20:53.292
- No, it's all right.
- What's all right?

1:20:53.542 --> 1:20:56.708
- I'll manage. I'll see what...
- You'll manage?

1:20:57.250 --> 1:21:02.792
Use your head! Tomorrow you tell
me what you can do for me.

1:21:22.375 --> 1:21:24.042
We have a problem, brother.

1:21:39.167 --> 1:21:43.750
- Make a petition. What can I say?
- Maybe Luciani can do something.

1:21:44.750 --> 1:21:50.458
I don't understand. I was his lapdog
and now you ask me to lick your ass?

1:21:50.500 --> 1:21:53.167
Not for myself, for our brothers.

1:21:53.875 --> 1:21:58.208
To stop being his slave and be yours?

1:21:58.583 --> 1:22:00.708
If you want a favor, learn to ask.

1:22:03.042 --> 1:22:06.667
- What do you want?
- What could I want here?

1:22:06.708 --> 1:22:09.375
- Respect.
- Do I look Corsican?

1:22:09.417 --> 1:22:14.750
- You think they trust you?
- I'll see what I can do.

1:22:34.625 --> 1:22:35.833
Luciani.

1:22:45.333 --> 1:22:51.417
- Now the meetings are here?
- It's cozy, warm, with a sea view.

1:22:51.750 --> 1:22:53.542
- Sit down.
- I'm fine here.

1:22:55.083 --> 1:22:58.875
- So, what do you want?
- I have a problem in Marseille.

1:23:00.042 --> 1:23:06.292
A cousin of yours, Brahim Lattrache.
I want you to pass a message.

1:23:07.333 --> 1:23:12.042
Tell him Luciani wants to talk
to him face to face, okay?

1:23:12.792 --> 1:23:18.667
- I'll see. What about the guards?
- I'll take care of that.

1:23:20.375 --> 1:23:22.333
Brahim Lattrache in Marseille.

1:23:29.708 --> 1:23:34.208
See the guy in red? He'll go to the end,
turn around and start again.

1:23:38.875 --> 1:23:42.958
The two that are running...
See the little guy with the hat?

1:23:43.417 --> 1:23:45.042
He'll do some push-ups.

1:23:50.333 --> 1:23:53.750
Check the game.
Look at the hoop.

1:23:58.083 --> 1:24:01.833
- Missed. Fuck him!
- No, the other.

1:24:09.708 --> 1:24:11.625
For me you see nothing?

1:24:16.167 --> 1:24:17.875
Yes.. snow.

1:24:36.875 --> 1:24:39.542
Ok. I'll move aside.

1:24:42.042 --> 1:24:43.083
Fuck you...

1:24:44.917 --> 1:24:46.250
Quick, quick!

1:24:51.167 --> 1:24:52.333
Ok

1:24:55.083 --> 1:24:58.750
Latif, the Egyptian. They let a car
pass and then ambushed Riyad.

1:24:59.292 --> 1:25:01.000
He was caught with hash.

1:25:01.792 --> 1:25:03.083
Now they want money.

1:25:04.083 --> 1:25:06.958
Who are those guys?
What do you know?

1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:13.208
Nothing. I know their boss is called
Latif, the Egyptian. From the south.

1:25:13.750 --> 1:25:17.125
They use the same road.
They know the secrets.

1:25:19.500 --> 1:25:20.917
What do we do?

1:25:23.792 --> 1:25:25.708
Give them what they ask.

1:25:27.625 --> 1:25:28.625
Boss!

1:25:28.708 --> 1:25:33.458
- Any news of his friend? - None.
What should I do? It's been 3 days...

1:25:33.500 --> 1:25:37.083
Calm down! There are many people
here and we have hash.

1:25:37.125 --> 1:25:41.042
If anyone knows the Egyptian
we'll know, don't worry.

1:25:41.583 --> 1:25:43.542
And he's going to hurt when I find him!

1:25:45.542 --> 1:25:47.750
- How are you doing with the beards?
- Getting along.

1:25:48.333 --> 1:25:51.167
Talk to them... and investigate.

1:26:08.875 --> 1:26:11.292
- I need a favor.
- What is it?

1:26:11.333 --> 1:26:16.292
- I need information about someone.
- Who? - A black, Latif, the Egyptian.

1:26:16.333 --> 1:26:19.250
Latif? What can I do?

1:26:19.292 --> 1:26:23.583
- Tell me who he knows here.
- His brother-in-law.

1:26:31.958 --> 1:26:35.292
- What's the deal?
- Nothing. It's my business.

1:26:35.333 --> 1:26:36.083
See him?

1:26:38.167 --> 1:26:39.667
The one over there.

1:26:39.875 --> 1:26:41.250
With the blue cap.

1:26:43.417 --> 1:26:46.375
Are the other two with him?

1:26:46.625 --> 1:26:49.333
- Seems that way.
- Will the Muslims help?

1:26:49.458 --> 1:26:55.667
- They give us two guys. - No problem.
If we plan well, everything'll be fine.

1:27:25.792 --> 1:27:27.042
Shut up!

1:27:35.500 --> 1:27:40.417
Boss! His ankle.
He needs a doctor.

1:28:07.208 --> 1:28:08.333
Lights!

1:28:23.875 --> 1:28:26.625
Mohammed Gaziler?
You know the Egyptian?

1:28:27.042 --> 1:28:29.000
- You know him?
- Yes

1:28:29.375 --> 1:28:30.417
Sit down.

1:28:35.250 --> 1:28:39.500
Ouassila is your mother?
Is her address on the visitors' list?

1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:40.958
Look.

1:28:43.625 --> 1:28:49.042
If you want to see her alive, tell Latif
I want my friend and my stuff, okay?

1:28:49.083 --> 1:28:50.667
- Okay?
- Agreed.

1:28:51.375 --> 1:28:52.375
Call.

1:29:02.792 --> 1:29:05.542
- Where were you?
- At the registrar's office.

1:29:05.583 --> 1:29:07.667
Everything Ok?

1:29:07.667 --> 1:29:10.292
- Have you eaten?
- I have to see a guy.

1:29:10.333 --> 1:29:13.417
It can wait.
Come for coffee.

1:29:20.125 --> 1:29:21.458
Help yourself.

1:29:29.792 --> 1:29:35.958
I want to talk to you. I've seen you in
the yard with this tall guy, the Gypsy.

1:29:36.750 --> 1:29:39.208
What's the business?
Hash, pills?

1:29:40.833 --> 1:29:43.958
- Hashish.
- A lot?

1:29:44.042 --> 1:29:49.042
- Want a part?
- No. It's your business, your business.

1:29:49.667 --> 1:29:52.458
- How does it come in?
- The visiting rooms, the kitchens.

1:29:52.500 --> 1:29:57.083
- So you bought off some guards.
- No. A dealer. Frozen food.

1:29:57.583 --> 1:30:00.708
- So that's how it works?
- For the moment, yes.

1:30:06.375 --> 1:30:08.417
What if you get caught?

1:30:12.042 --> 1:30:13.083
The hole.

1:30:14.083 --> 1:30:16.000
And no furloughs.

1:30:18.667 --> 1:30:24.875
What did I say last time? To be careful.
Not to risk your outings.

1:30:25.458 --> 1:30:30.375
What do you do? Fight with some guys.
Lay down your law. What's your game?

1:30:31.250 --> 1:30:36.917
You're valuable with furloughs, Djebena.
If not, what good are you?

1:30:38.167 --> 1:30:39.083
Get out.

1:30:45.458 --> 1:30:46.500
Get out!

1:31:07.875 --> 1:31:09.167
Bastard!

1:31:14.875 --> 1:31:16.583
I'll kill you...

1:31:27.833 --> 1:31:29.833
You don't fear me any more?

1:31:34.833 --> 1:31:39.625
If you get around,
it's because I made you a porter.

1:31:40.542 --> 1:31:46.750
If you eat it's thanks to me. If you
dream, think, live... it's thanks to me.

1:31:49.833 --> 1:31:52.625
You say you have no guards.
Bullshit!

1:31:54.000 --> 1:32:00.167
You have Luciani etched on your face!
You live for me, Djebena!

1:32:03.458 --> 1:32:08.458
They look at you and they see me. Who
else would they see? Can you tell me?

1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:40.000
Are you here?

1:34:29.375 --> 1:34:30.292
Come here.

1:34:32.417 --> 1:34:36.000
Enough already.
Come here I said.

1:34:36.542 --> 1:34:38.542
I have something fun
to tell you.

1:34:45.458 --> 1:34:47.333
You're going to Marseille.

1:34:49.792 --> 1:34:52.583
Your next leave will be to Marseille.

1:34:53.667 --> 1:34:55.917
From Brecourt to Marseille in a day?

1:34:57.625 --> 1:35:01.292
There is a flight at 9 am
and a return flight at 3.

1:35:02.167 --> 1:35:04.542
There you will see Brahim Lattrache.

1:35:06.292 --> 1:35:07.875
Should I take anything?

1:35:10.042 --> 1:35:11.917
No. You talk and listen.

1:35:12.583 --> 1:35:16.000
Find out the cost of cutting
ties to the Italians.

1:35:19.292 --> 1:35:24.875
Tell him I'm interested in negotiating
without Jacky Marciaggi and the others.

1:35:27.208 --> 1:35:32.542
Sampiero will contact your friend
for payment and expenses.

1:35:37.250 --> 1:35:38.750
Have you ever flown?

1:36:25.292 --> 1:36:27.500
Good morning, Truette.

1:36:27.542 --> 1:36:30.333
- Morning, El Djebena.
- Good morning, sir.

1:36:30.458 --> 1:36:31.708
Open up, please.

1:37:02.792 --> 1:37:07.458
- Look at the time, I arrived on time!
- Careful! Don't talk to me like that.

1:37:07.500 --> 1:37:12.417
- How should I talk? I'm at risk here.
- Okay, okay. I understand.

1:37:13.542 --> 1:37:18.042
This car is a piece of shit!
A lure for the police.

1:37:18.833 --> 1:37:22.500
- You're becoming an idiot.
- Enough is enough. - Why enouogh?

1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:27.042
Who made you the boss?
If you want to split, say so.

1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:30.833
Keep that for Latif's trunk.

1:38:00.417 --> 1:38:01.958
Get Latif out of your head.

1:38:03.500 --> 1:38:05.958
I'll find him and I'll finish him.

1:38:07.292 --> 1:38:10.917
You won't finish anyone. Wake up.
Business has stopped.

1:38:11.125 --> 1:38:14.375
It's nothing personal.
That bastard has blocked everything.

1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:18.500
We got back the hash,
but we can't move it.

1:38:20.250 --> 1:38:25.708
They even fucked us up in the city.
I swear I'll finish him off.

1:38:26.875 --> 1:38:27.917
Fuck them!

1:38:30.125 --> 1:38:31.958
You look like a lawyer.

1:38:40.792 --> 1:38:43.875
Boarding at 9:55,
gate 33, Terminal 2.

1:38:44.625 --> 1:38:45.625
Bon voyage.

1:39:03.125 --> 1:39:04.208
Come forward.

1:39:05.750 --> 1:39:06.875
Raise your arms.

1:40:54.542 --> 1:40:56.125
- Hands!
- Why?

1:40:56.375 --> 1:40:57.458
Hands!

1:41:48.292 --> 1:41:49.125
Move..

1:42:04.708 --> 1:42:06.250
Is this necessary?

1:42:07.667 --> 1:42:08.833
I'm not worried.

1:42:09.750 --> 1:42:11.000
What does Luciani want?

1:42:11.833 --> 1:42:14.958
He wants to know your price to quit the
deal with the Italians in the casino.

1:42:16.333 --> 1:42:20.333
If you agree, he'll gurantee your
position with the slot machines.

1:42:21.500 --> 1:42:25.208
How will he guarantee our work?
With his ration card?

1:42:26.167 --> 1:42:27.292
No, with the Council.

1:42:27.333 --> 1:42:31.625
Sampiero will guarantee your place
with Marcaggi and the Corsican Council.

1:42:35.917 --> 1:42:40.500
- How long have you known Luciani?
- From prison.

1:42:42.667 --> 1:42:44.208
Have you worked for him
all this time?

1:42:46.417 --> 1:42:49.917
How was it? Did you arrive
and begin to work?

1:42:52.458 --> 1:42:55.583
- Does he protect you?
- No. I work. He doesn't protect me.

1:42:55.625 --> 1:42:58.625
- You're his Arab. He protects you.
- No. I work for them.

1:42:59.500 --> 1:43:00.542
At what price?

1:43:02.500 --> 1:43:05.792
Are you the mole?
Do you send messages?

1:43:06.917 --> 1:43:08.542
- Do you suck him off?
- What the hell is this?

1:43:12.583 --> 1:43:16.583
Why does an Arab work for the Corsicans?
Do you belly dance for them?

1:43:17.208 --> 1:43:22.167
Are you his girl? I had a friend there.
He never came out.

1:43:23.583 --> 1:43:27.167
His name was Reyeb.
Sound familiar?

1:43:28.792 --> 1:43:29.958
Sound familiar?

1:43:32.500 --> 1:43:36.542
Was it Luciani who killed him?
What do you know?

1:43:37.292 --> 1:43:38.708
What do you know?

1:43:49.583 --> 1:43:52.083
Animals coming!
Watch out!

1:44:04.708 --> 1:44:06.875
There! Two more!

1:44:08.708 --> 1:44:09.542
Kill it!

1:44:25.417 --> 1:44:28.833
What are you about?
How did you know this?

1:44:29.333 --> 1:44:33.500
What are you? What are you?
A prophet or what?

1:44:37.625 --> 1:44:39.125
I killed Reyeb.

1:44:43.625 --> 1:44:45.917
Fuck. You've come a long way.

1:45:14.667 --> 1:45:17.333
- What's your name?
- Malik. - Malik.

1:45:17.750 --> 1:45:23.625
- I'll wash your shirt and pants.
- The pants aren't dirty. - You sure?

1:45:24.125 --> 1:45:25.750
Then give me the shirt.

1:45:49.583 --> 1:45:55.375
Here's your shirt, son. I washed it,
but the blood stains won't come off.

1:46:03.875 --> 1:46:10.083
Hey, prophet! Tell me. The Muslims want
to talk about Luciani. Is that it?

1:46:13.250 --> 1:46:16.917
You speak with the Muslims,
the Corsicans, you come here...

1:46:17.917 --> 1:46:21.917
You deal with everyone. That's
not good for your balls, you know?

1:46:23.542 --> 1:46:24.792
Do you also talk to Lingherri?

1:46:28.417 --> 1:46:32.583
Looks like someone is spying among the
Corsicans. Does your boss know?

1:46:33.417 --> 1:46:35.917
- Are you sure?
- Sure.

1:46:36.167 --> 1:46:40.583
- Do you know him well?
- I think so...

1:46:42.042 --> 1:46:43.667
Well, tell this to Luciani.

1:46:44.250 --> 1:46:50.417
I accept his offer with one condition.
Find the spy and clean the house.

1:46:55.583 --> 1:46:59.583
I need a favor. I'm having
trouble with a guy in Paris.

1:46:59.583 --> 1:47:02.458
His name is Latif, the Egyptian.
You know him?

1:47:03.417 --> 1:47:04.708
What can I do for you?

1:47:06.208 --> 1:47:08.167
Can you tell him we know each other?

1:47:09.167 --> 1:47:10.458
That we work together?

1:47:13.500 --> 1:47:14.417
We work together...

1:47:15.208 --> 1:47:16.792
You think I can say that?

1:47:23.125 --> 1:47:25.542
Let's eat before you go.

1:47:27.583 --> 1:47:29.958
- Can I go to the beach?
- Whatever.

1:48:10.292 --> 1:48:11.333
Hurry!

1:48:15.917 --> 1:48:17.042
Has everything gone well?

1:48:26.125 --> 1:48:31.417
- You'll see Latif and talk to him.
- Really? With that asshole?

1:48:32.917 --> 1:48:39.125
- Lattrache will talk to him.
- What does he have to do with it?

1:48:39.500 --> 1:48:43.375
His problem is the Corsicans and ours,
Latif. We'll help each other.

1:48:44.875 --> 1:48:50.625
I proposed a deal. Let's be partners. We
share everything. Caches, cars, vendors.

1:48:51.708 --> 1:48:56.417
- We occupy the market and control it.
- Know what you're asking, brother?

1:48:57.583 --> 1:49:02.375
We'll settle all accounts when the time
comes. For now we leave it as it is.

1:49:08.333 --> 1:49:09.500
I'm sick again.

1:49:12.792 --> 1:49:16.833
The test results are not
good. I need more chemo.

1:49:22.875 --> 1:49:24.083
Will you be okay?

1:49:29.708 --> 1:49:31.292
Take care, brother.

1:49:37.292 --> 1:49:40.458
You're 30 minutes late.
You know the rules.

1:49:40.583 --> 1:49:44.333
- All day working with car doors...
- Spread your legs.

1:49:45.625 --> 1:49:49.667
I'll let it go this time, but think
about your probation, moron.

1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:51.000
Use your watch.

1:50:08.750 --> 1:50:12.583
I don't care about Marcaggi's gratitude.

1:50:13.875 --> 1:50:18.125
What I want is for him to move
his ass and fix this.

1:50:19.750 --> 1:50:26.000
As we speak one of us is sleeping
with the Italians. I want to know who.

1:50:27.208 --> 1:50:31.250
- Does he know? - Yes
- So?

1:50:31.958 --> 1:50:33.583
He's negotiating with him...

1:50:34.917 --> 1:50:39.583
- He thinks of himself.
- Same as Lattrache.

1:50:40.292 --> 1:50:43.458
- Do you know who he is?
- No.

1:50:46.500 --> 1:50:50.583
Wait, Cesar. Jacky wants
you out of this.

1:50:50.625 --> 1:50:54.083
Neither on one side nor the other.
Out!

1:50:56.333 --> 1:51:01.083
- He says if you need anything...
- Okay, okay. Understood.

1:51:07.792 --> 1:51:09.292
I have good news.

1:51:10.750 --> 1:51:16.958
About creating a hotel company. I've
found someone. A Basque from Pamplona.

1:51:19.083 --> 1:51:23.292
- Why do you say "good news"?
- You asked me to look for someone.

1:51:23.333 --> 1:51:26.167
Wait. We are talking about
Jacky, Sardinia, casinos,

1:51:26.750 --> 1:51:31.125
You tell me not to interfere and
suddenly you speak of good news.

1:51:31.292 --> 1:51:34.125
- The ones before were not good?
- Yes.

1:51:34.833 --> 1:51:38.583
- Why then "good news now"?
- I didn't say "now".

1:51:39.167 --> 1:51:43.500
- I can tell you two good things.
- Yeah? Why did it take you so long?

1:51:45.625 --> 1:51:46.875
Thanks, boss.

1:52:03.167 --> 1:52:04.167
Pass the papers.

1:52:12.667 --> 1:52:16.375
- You got the results?
- Which match?

1:52:24.750 --> 1:52:26.167
Why do you make coffee?

1:52:29.000 --> 1:52:31.083
Because you're still a servant?

1:52:33.292 --> 1:52:37.000
You go out for me, you see Sampiero,
you see Lattrache.

1:52:37.500 --> 1:52:42.375
You take care of my business...
The casinos, the Lingherris.

1:52:43.583 --> 1:52:46.458
And when I ask for coffee, you make it.

1:52:57.958 --> 1:53:02.042
- Don't you have anything to say?
- Which is the question?

1:53:02.542 --> 1:53:07.167
Why do I do it, or how I feel?
I do it because you ask me to.

1:53:08.167 --> 1:53:11.208
- Want to know how I feel?
- No, no. I'm not interested.

1:53:13.375 --> 1:53:18.500
- Do you still need me?
- It's you who needs me.

1:53:21.875 --> 1:53:22.833
Can I go?

1:53:33.375 --> 1:53:36.958
You hear me?
When will I see Latif?

1:53:37.917 --> 1:53:42.833
Listen. Give my whole part
to Imam Moussab. All of it.

1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:47.958
No idea.
Try the mosque.

1:53:48.542 --> 1:53:51.708
I want him to know the money
is from Malik El Djebena.

1:53:52.000 --> 1:53:54.583
He'll know how to find me.

1:53:55.250 --> 1:53:58.292
Do as I say. Leave me
a message afterwards.

1:54:28.750 --> 1:54:30.667
Move that ass, nigger.

1:54:41.333 --> 1:54:42.958
- How you doing?
- Okay.

1:55:38.958 --> 1:55:43.833
Is the money at the mosque yours?
Is it dirty money?

1:55:44.292 --> 1:55:45.917
Of course it's dirty!

1:55:47.292 --> 1:55:51.083
But it's better in his hands
than in mine.

1:55:51.500 --> 1:55:53.333
Do you think the Imam will accept it?

1:55:55.125 --> 1:55:56.667
It depends on you, friends.

1:55:59.750 --> 1:56:04.958
I understand what you do here and I
respect that, but you have no power.

1:56:05.458 --> 1:56:07.875
The Corsicans control the guards.

1:56:08.792 --> 1:56:12.625
You pray in pigsties, you sleep in
shitty places. You rise...

1:56:12.667 --> 1:56:17.208
and they crush you again. Perhaps the
Imam knows how to use that money.

1:56:19.042 --> 1:56:20.125
What do you want?

1:56:21.417 --> 1:56:24.583
Just like you, Hassan.
A better life for me and my brothers.

1:56:25.125 --> 1:56:29.417
You think I'm stupid or what?
You just want to use us. That's all.

1:56:29.458 --> 1:56:33.417
So? As long as it's good for everyone.

1:56:37.792 --> 1:56:42.083
Listen. If you ever talk to
the Imam again, you're dead.

1:56:42.542 --> 1:56:46.083
You talk money to me.
It's between us, okay?

1:56:50.958 --> 1:56:54.583
Is that why you gave him the money?
To talk to me?

1:56:57.583 --> 1:57:00.000
- From a killer to a killer?
- Leave that shit.

1:57:00.042 --> 1:57:01.458
Just kidding.

1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:40.750
Christmas

1:57:57.500 --> 1:58:00.708
Handmade. No gifts, no Christmas.

1:58:04.958 --> 1:58:09.625
- I am the gift. 100% handmade.
- What a gift!

1:58:10.750 --> 1:58:13.708
Want some?
Help yourself.

1:58:18.625 --> 1:58:20.208
Is it made from wild boar?

1:58:21.958 --> 1:58:23.042
Are you kidding?

1:58:24.750 --> 1:58:27.250
Shall we stop?
Can we talk honestly?

1:58:30.958 --> 1:58:32.000
Why?

1:58:34.333 --> 1:58:38.917
I have to ask you a favor,
but not because you work for me,

1:58:40.125 --> 1:58:43.833
but because I trust you.
Do you see the difference?

1:58:46.250 --> 1:58:47.708
I'm not sure.

1:58:55.167 --> 1:58:57.750
I saw Vettori. He has some information.

1:58:58.333 --> 1:59:01.000
He knows that I'm dealing
with the Lingherris.

1:59:01.792 --> 1:59:05.417
Form a team.
How are your guys?

1:59:06.208 --> 1:59:08.542
- A team for what?
- To eliminate them.

1:59:08.750 --> 1:59:12.333
- Eliminate the Lingherris?
- The Lingherris and Jacky Marcaggi.

1:59:13.000 --> 1:59:16.375
Kill Marcaggi? Is that it?
Kill your boss?

1:59:16.750 --> 1:59:22.167
Nobody must know. You, me,
Vettori and nobody else.

1:59:22.875 --> 1:59:24.375
It will be in Paris.

1:59:24.792 --> 1:59:29.708
Vettori will provide the stuff. He'll
help, but we must remain invisible.

1:59:30.375 --> 1:59:31.792
Can you do that for me?

1:59:52.167 --> 1:59:54.167
Any plans for when you get out?

1:59:58.292 --> 2:00:02.083
When we have the casinos,
we'll need someone to manage them.

2:00:03.917 --> 2:00:05.167
With Lattrache.

2:00:24.667 --> 2:00:28.042
We'll do it. We'll do it.
I only have six months.

2:00:28.083 --> 2:00:31.833
- Six more months and that's it.
- Maybe they're wrong.

2:00:32.167 --> 2:00:34.833
Give me time.
What's the problem?

2:00:35.333 --> 2:00:37.958
- Kill those guys?
- Speak softly.

2:00:38.333 --> 2:00:40.750
We don't know them.
What do we care?

2:00:41.208 --> 2:00:43.167
Think about when you get out.

2:00:44.917 --> 2:00:46.000
I won't be here.

2:00:46.458 --> 2:00:49.208
You can think of your future, I can't.

2:00:49.625 --> 2:00:53.250
Malik... there's Djamila.
There's my son.

2:00:53.292 --> 2:00:58.083
- What'll I leave them? A fridge? A TV?
- What are you saying?

2:00:59.000 --> 2:01:00.833
You'll take care of them.

2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:05.958
That's what I ask you, brother.

2:01:06.625 --> 2:01:10.292
You'll say we agree.
And we'll do it.

2:01:33.958 --> 2:01:37.667
I talked to my outside friend.
We'll do it.

2:01:37.792 --> 2:01:40.083
He's put together a first class team.

2:01:41.208 --> 2:01:46.667
I'll talk to my people. Give me the
number. Vettori will call your friend.

2:02:50.792 --> 2:02:52.333
Have you tried this?

2:02:54.125 --> 2:02:55.583
I'll give you some.

2:04:41.458 --> 2:04:44.667
Are you listening? It's bad.

2:04:44.750 --> 2:04:48.042
Our guys are good for drugs.
Not for other stuff.

2:04:48.500 --> 2:04:52.542
- You were the one who wanted to do it.
What now? - I can't force them.

2:04:53.083 --> 2:04:57.917
When the Corsicans took out the
guns they ran away. Like devils.

2:04:57.958 --> 2:05:01.417
That bastard Vettori
treats us like shit.

2:05:01.542 --> 2:05:05.083
There was a fight on the way.
Now Khalid wants to kill him.

2:05:07.333 --> 2:05:09.667
- Find some other guys.
- Now?

2:05:09.708 --> 2:05:11.292
- For a contract?
- Who cares?

2:05:14.167 --> 2:05:15.250
You got a minute.

2:05:22.542 --> 2:05:24.750
I lost my time and money
with this group of idiots and...

2:05:26.292 --> 2:05:27.750
just look at him!

2:05:28.167 --> 2:05:30.958
- Be careful what you say.
- I will deliver you from your misery!

2:05:31.375 --> 2:05:32.792
- Hands off!
- Calm down!

2:05:35.125 --> 2:05:37.708
Hush! We will do it our way.

2:05:37.750 --> 2:05:40.750
- What?
- I'll try to explain. May I?

2:05:43.333 --> 2:05:46.875
- Listen. We'll kill them.
- Promise.

2:05:46.917 --> 2:05:50.458
We'll kill them,
but they can't know how.

2:05:51.000 --> 2:05:54.375
- I'm going to hit you. Lower you head.
- What?

2:05:54.417 --> 2:05:56.292
I'll hit you and you lower your head.

2:06:00.792 --> 2:06:04.167
I get it. Can I go on?

2:06:18.625 --> 2:06:22.917
Pick me up without the others.
You and I will deal with this.

2:06:24.250 --> 2:06:25.333
Will you be able to do it?

2:06:32.708 --> 2:06:33.667
Guard!

2:06:34.708 --> 2:06:38.042
Are you ready to complete your
insertion and rehabilitation project?

2:06:38.667 --> 2:06:44.375
- It's a support center for detainees.
- I know Imam Moussab's Center.

2:06:45.500 --> 2:06:49.917
You requested two days.
It seems excessive.

2:06:50.250 --> 2:06:52.875
I propose a practice module of one day.
From 7am to 7 pm.

2:06:54.625 --> 2:06:56.583
- Is that all right?
- Yes, very good.

2:07:11.500 --> 2:07:16.708
Muhammed, peace be upon him, reached
the top of the mountain and fell asleep.

2:07:17.167 --> 2:07:23.125
The angel Gabriel appeared.
Do you know what he said?

2:07:23.500 --> 2:07:28.167
He said, "Pray, pray, Muhammed.
Pray to God because He created you. "

2:07:28.208 --> 2:07:33.500
"He created mankind from scratch.
Pray what He taught in his writings. "

2:07:36.208 --> 2:07:37.250
Wonderful!

2:07:38.375 --> 2:07:40.417
Wonderful, brother!

2:07:43.750 --> 2:07:45.917
Prayer.

2:08:03.000 --> 2:08:03.958
The door.

2:08:12.208 --> 2:08:13.042
Have a good day, Djebena.

2:08:28.333 --> 2:08:29.958
- What about the others?
- In the back.

2:08:59.625 --> 2:09:01.125
The car comes out here.

2:09:03.542 --> 2:09:07.875
A bodyguard and a driver. The guard
gets out first to open the door.

2:09:12.000 --> 2:09:15.667
He wears a bulletproof vest.
We let them get out.

2:09:17.917 --> 2:09:19.458
We hit the bodyguard first,
then the others.

2:09:22.792 --> 2:09:23.625
Come on.

2:10:18.333 --> 2:10:19.375
They're coming out.

2:10:19.583 --> 2:10:20.708
Coming.

2:10:20.875 --> 2:10:22.000
Black car.

2:10:22.708 --> 2:10:23.792
Wait for them to come out.

2:10:25.208 --> 2:10:26.208
I'll go for the bodyguard.

2:10:52.250 --> 2:10:53.333
What's going on?

2:11:40.667 --> 2:11:42.667
Come on, come on!

2:11:46.083 --> 2:11:47.083
See them?

2:11:49.750 --> 2:11:51.250
Yes, now I see them.

2:11:52.375 --> 2:11:54.167
- Three cars in front.
- Follow them!

2:12:01.625 --> 2:12:05.000
It's turning. What do we do?
They stopped!

2:12:05.125 --> 2:12:09.208
- Go on. I'll kill them.
- How? It's an armored car.

2:12:10.083 --> 2:12:14.667
I tell you it's armored. If they don't
come out, there's nothing we can do.

2:12:22.667 --> 2:12:23.583
What's he doing?

2:12:24.458 --> 2:12:25.458
Buying tobacco.

2:12:40.917 --> 2:12:44.000
- I'll go.
- It won't work.

2:13:34.833 --> 2:13:36.042
Macarggi here!

2:13:37.917 --> 2:13:39.000
Down!

2:14:11.250 --> 2:14:15.417
I can't hear!
I hear nothing!

2:14:42.917 --> 2:14:45.792
This blood is not mine.
It's theirs.

2:15:04.042 --> 2:15:06.083
We've fucked you up, pigs!

2:15:16.208 --> 2:15:17.458
Are you Jacky Marcaggi?

2:15:19.292 --> 2:15:23.500
Don't talk. I can't hear. Just signs.
Do you know this guy?

2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:28.542
Your friend Luciani sent us to kill you.

2:15:29.583 --> 2:15:31.583
I won't do it. He's all yours.

2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:34.583
- Get revenge!
- I'll take care of him.

2:16:10.375 --> 2:16:13.792
- Are you sleeping?
- No, no. I'm exhausted.

2:16:15.750 --> 2:16:19.292
- Have you talked to Djamila?
- I'll sleep in the kids' room.

2:16:21.042 --> 2:16:24.708
- You won't go back tonight?
- No, I'll go back tomorrow.

2:16:27.083 --> 2:16:31.833
- They'll put you in a punishment cell.
- As the Corsicans kill each other.

2:16:34.375 --> 2:16:35.625
Need anything?

2:16:40.667 --> 2:16:42.417
I'm not doing chemo.

2:16:44.042 --> 2:16:45.375
You're screwed.

2:16:58.750 --> 2:17:02.125
Watch your sleeve.
You're rubbing it on the plate.

2:17:07.250 --> 2:17:10.042
- Eat a little, Riyad.
- I'm eating.

2:17:10.083 --> 2:17:12.833
- Want some more?
- No thanks.

2:17:13.375 --> 2:17:15.875
- Any good?
- Yes, delicious.

2:18:34.792 --> 2:18:37.417
El Djebena, Malik.
35114T.

2:19:52.125 --> 2:19:54.917
40 days - 40 nights

2:21:35.042 --> 2:21:36.292
Are you there?

2:22:26.042 --> 2:22:27.375
Are you there?

2:26:03.500 --> 2:26:05.958
Make sure you have everything
and sign here.

2:26:32.958 --> 2:26:34.125
Garbage.

2:26:52.375 --> 2:26:56.375
Your exit papers.
The door.

2:26:58.083 --> 2:27:02.292
- Good luck, Djebena.
- Good day, sir.

2:27:29.875 --> 2:27:30.792
How are you?

2:27:36.708 --> 2:27:37.542
- It's cold.
- Very.

2:27:40.333 --> 2:27:41.917
It's not a good time to come out.

2:27:48.417 --> 2:27:50.208
- Have you come by bus?
- Yes

2:27:52.583 --> 2:27:55.292
- When's the next one?
- Half an hour.

2:27:58.250 --> 2:28:00.667
- Want to walk a little?
- If you like.

2:28:02.292 --> 2:28:04.042
Do you know where you're going to live?

2:28:05.917 --> 2:28:09.333
Come home. I'll sleep with the
child and you use his room.

2:28:10.583 --> 2:28:12.833
- I don't want to disturb.
- You won't.

2:28:14.125 --> 2:28:17.250
Okay.

2:28:51.125 --> 2:28:57.042
A PROPHET

2:29:39.250 --> 2:29:41.667
a film by
Jacques Audiard
