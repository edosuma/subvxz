WEBVTT

01:18.478 --> 01:19.847
- Nigel!
- Oh, mate,

01:19.881 --> 01:21.415
you sure you need another one?

01:21.448 --> 01:23.216
Oh, come on, Nige,

01:23.250 --> 01:26.688
I think I made it with 40 cents
left in the kitty.

01:26.721 --> 01:28.523
You'll end up
going home on a stretcher...

01:28.556 --> 01:31.158
Do you have any idea, Nigel,

01:31.191 --> 01:33.427
of the mental fortitude it takes

01:33.460 --> 01:36.831
to be this town's
most eligible bachelor

01:36.864 --> 01:39.399
without a bloody job?

01:39.433 --> 01:43.203
So, yeah, hit me with that rum.

01:44.872 --> 01:49.409
Why don't you just get yourself
a different job?

01:49.443 --> 01:51.478
Doing what, mate?

01:51.512 --> 01:52.513
Hey?

01:52.547 --> 01:53.881
Well...

01:53.915 --> 01:55.850
I've been in that mill
since I was 15,

01:55.883 --> 01:59.654
and I finally make it
to management and bam!

01:59.687 --> 02:01.321
See ya later.

02:04.692 --> 02:05.793
- Here you go.
- That's on the house...

02:05.827 --> 02:07.494
No, no, no, mate, no, no!

02:07.528 --> 02:08.896
- Yeah.
- I'm flush, Nige!

02:08.930 --> 02:10.263
I'm renting
the old worker's cottage

02:10.297 --> 02:12.700
out to some English bird
from the city.

02:12.734 --> 02:16.236
I tell ya,
if she looks half as good

02:16.269 --> 02:18.405
as she sounds on the phone.

02:20.875 --> 02:23.276
Plus, I'm gonna...

02:23.310 --> 02:25.479
I'm gonna harvest the fields
behind the cottage.

02:29.316 --> 02:31.418
- You're not serious.
- Yeah, deadly.

02:32.987 --> 02:35.489
Can't afford to just
leave 'em there anymore.

02:38.291 --> 02:39.794
Mate, I don't have a choice.

02:42.462 --> 02:44.498
Don't look at me
like that, Nige.

02:46.266 --> 02:48.301
You win some, you lose some.

02:49.604 --> 02:51.171
Thanks for it.

02:53.608 --> 02:54.575
God.

03:21.334 --> 03:23.403
You are shitting me, come on.

03:23.437 --> 03:25.238
Oh, fuck.

03:28.676 --> 03:30.712
Come here. Come here, come here.

03:42.322 --> 03:44.726
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck!

03:48.696 --> 03:49.964
Is there a torch?

04:21.763 --> 04:22.830
Hello?

04:24.431 --> 04:25.767
Oh, fuck.

04:40.681 --> 04:42.016
Oy!

05:20.521 --> 05:22.389
Who's there?

06:42.937 --> 06:47.108
We are really right
to feel these things.

06:47.141 --> 06:49.442
We are highly intuitive beings,

06:49.476 --> 06:53.614
and we can feel subtle changes
against the natural flow.

06:59.020 --> 07:02.657
So when feelings of despair
and dread come up...

07:10.531 --> 07:12.566
The pain behind the fear,

07:12.600 --> 07:15.136
the unknown that cannot be seen

07:15.169 --> 07:16.971
will create fear.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.126
Step out from the darkness

07:39.160 --> 07:42.063
and shine a light
to awaken your love.

07:49.303 --> 07:51.906
We're not wrong to feel loss,

07:51.939 --> 07:54.675
and pain of the heart.

07:54.709 --> 07:58.846
We must search and seek
holding on to love.

08:15.296 --> 08:16.998
Pause for a moment.

09:38.179 --> 09:40.381
- Hello?
- Hi.

09:40.414 --> 09:42.249
I'm Hanna Montague.

09:42.283 --> 09:43.717
I'm renting the, um...

09:43.751 --> 09:45.052
I spoke to Mr. Lipton
about renting

09:45.086 --> 09:46.654
the worker's cottage.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.923
Cottage isn't up for rent.

09:48.956 --> 09:50.791
There was an ad, I called.

09:50.825 --> 09:52.626
I spoke to Mr. Lipton,
I've just tried to call him,

09:52.660 --> 09:53.928
but I can't seem
to get a hold of him.

09:53.961 --> 09:56.997
John! What's Lipton
gone and done now?

09:57.031 --> 09:58.666
How would I bloody know?

09:58.699 --> 10:00.734
Yeah, I'm renting
the worker's cottage

10:00.768 --> 10:02.303
from Mr. Lipton.

10:02.336 --> 10:04.171
I can't seem
to get a hold of him.

10:04.205 --> 10:06.073
Let me handle this.

10:10.945 --> 10:12.012
Don't worry about her.

10:12.046 --> 10:13.080
Come on, I'll show you in.

10:13.114 --> 10:14.949
Thank you.

10:14.982 --> 10:17.885
Jimmy didn't tell us
he put the cottage up for rent.

10:17.918 --> 10:19.987
We sold it to him
a couple years back

10:20.020 --> 10:22.990
along with the fields.

10:23.023 --> 10:25.359
Still run the cane, though.

10:25.392 --> 10:28.229
Jimmy couldn't grow a weed
in a rainforest.

10:30.297 --> 10:33.767
I hope your wife's okay
with me being here.

10:33.801 --> 10:35.769
Oh, she'll get over it.

10:35.803 --> 10:37.371
We're just not getting
many visitors around here.

10:37.404 --> 10:39.306
Mm.

10:39.340 --> 10:41.041
This'll be good for her.

10:42.376 --> 10:44.011
I passed the police
on my way in.

10:44.044 --> 10:46.147
There seemed to be
some sort of an accident.

10:47.915 --> 10:50.251
- Accident?
- Yeah, just up the road.

10:54.255 --> 10:58.092
So, what is it
you're doing here, Miss...?

10:58.125 --> 10:59.960
Hanna, please, call me Hanna.

11:01.262 --> 11:03.430
I'm John Drake, wife's Elenor.

11:03.464 --> 11:04.798
Nice to meet you, John.

11:04.832 --> 11:06.467
So you were...

11:06.500 --> 11:09.203
Just a change of scenery,

11:09.236 --> 11:10.771
clear my head, not much.

11:10.804 --> 11:12.373
Well, you came to
the right place for "not much."

11:15.075 --> 11:17.044
- Do you need a hand?
- No, I'm good.

11:17.077 --> 11:18.179
All right, well,
if you need anything,

11:18.212 --> 11:19.947
- don't hesitate.
- Thanks, John.

11:21.516 --> 11:22.683
Oh!

11:23.817 --> 11:26.887
Oh, I'll need that.

11:26.921 --> 11:28.022
Thank you.

11:28.055 --> 11:30.224
Oh, and don't worry about Ellie.

11:30.257 --> 11:31.158
She'll warm up to you.

12:34.922 --> 12:37.124
It's just that
you left in a hurry.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.125
We're just all concerned

12:38.158 --> 12:40.528
and hope that you're doing
the right thing.

12:40.562 --> 12:42.029
I know, Jules.

12:42.062 --> 12:44.898
Are you... are you keeping up
with your diary?

12:44.932 --> 12:46.568
Haven't missed a beat.

12:46.601 --> 12:49.103
How could I with you on my ass?

12:49.136 --> 12:50.538
I'm not just your sponsor,

12:50.572 --> 12:52.406
I'm your friend as well.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.441
I want it to work out for you.

12:54.475 --> 12:56.277
I know, Jules, I get it, I do.

12:58.145 --> 13:01.382
I really hope you find
what you're looking for, Hanna.

13:01.415 --> 13:03.450
I just want to give him
a proper burial.

13:05.553 --> 13:07.354
I can't rest
until that happens.

13:30.444 --> 13:32.413
Sorry, John.

13:32.446 --> 13:34.848
It's Jimmy.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.050
What happened?

13:36.083 --> 13:39.153
I found him facedown
in the drainage ditch.

13:39.186 --> 13:40.421
He drowned.

13:40.454 --> 13:41.589
Drowned?

13:41.623 --> 13:44.124
Fell over while
he was taking a piss.

13:44.158 --> 13:45.392
You're fucking kidding me.

13:48.095 --> 13:49.564
Sort that car out.

13:57.004 --> 14:00.074
Mate had been talking
to contractors.

14:00.107 --> 14:03.545
He'd been organizing
to have your field harvested.

14:09.149 --> 14:11.519
He must've been dying
for that piss

14:11.553 --> 14:14.188
to hit the brakes
that fucking hard.

14:15.989 --> 14:17.592
He accidentally fell
in the ditch

14:17.625 --> 14:20.562
while he was taking a piss,
and he drowned.

14:20.595 --> 14:21.696
That's what's going
in my report,

14:21.730 --> 14:24.264
that's where we leave it,
do you understand, John?

14:25.466 --> 14:27.635
- John?
- Yeah.

14:30.938 --> 14:33.941
Yeah. I see you've got
a visitor at your place.

14:35.976 --> 14:38.145
Yeah, some English woman's
renting a cottage.

14:38.178 --> 14:41.048
Yeah, well, you know who she is.

14:41.081 --> 14:43.117
Mate.

14:43.150 --> 14:45.185
I'm not the fucking landlord.

14:46.153 --> 14:48.255
But all of this,

14:48.288 --> 14:51.925
this here,

14:51.959 --> 14:53.460
it has to stop.

14:56.063 --> 14:58.633
What about your missus?

14:58.666 --> 15:00.568
Is she ready to stop?

15:08.242 --> 15:10.545
See, that's
what I fucking thought.

16:23.651 --> 16:27.287
Find yourself
as you search for the light.

16:27.321 --> 16:29.189
Bring this into your soul

16:29.223 --> 16:31.358
and seek the peace,

16:31.391 --> 16:35.162
the more I shall
release my grip.

16:35.195 --> 16:36.631
Know that me being here

16:36.664 --> 16:39.734
is my way of
holding your memory...

16:45.339 --> 16:47.374
...holding on to love,

16:47.407 --> 16:51.078
the less I will need
to hold you so tight.

16:51.111 --> 16:54.549
Do not fear me,
for I am here always with you

16:54.582 --> 16:56.618
and close to your chest.

16:56.651 --> 16:59.052
I am a strong and true
and loyal friend

16:59.086 --> 17:01.523
to hold you in your life.

17:01.556 --> 17:03.558
Life is in your hands.

17:03.591 --> 17:06.360
Face me with courage.

17:06.393 --> 17:08.830
I am here to guide you, my love.

17:08.863 --> 17:12.366
It does not have to be so dark.

17:12.399 --> 17:14.536
Search with me
and within yourself

17:14.569 --> 17:17.137
for the light
which will bring you back

17:17.170 --> 17:19.239
without fear.

17:19.273 --> 17:22.376
My message for you, dear one,
is of coming to peace

17:22.409 --> 17:26.179
and healing to become whole.

18:47.729 --> 18:48.596
Hanna!

18:50.832 --> 18:52.466
Hanna.

18:52.499 --> 18:54.368
In here, John.

18:57.939 --> 18:59.439
Hey.

19:03.945 --> 19:06.246
So that's why you're here.

19:06.279 --> 19:09.182
Another journo
come to pick at the scabs.

19:09.216 --> 19:10.450
It's not what you think.

19:10.484 --> 19:12.319
I'm not a journalist.

19:12.352 --> 19:13.755
Then what are you?

19:15.957 --> 19:17.759
A mother.

19:22.730 --> 19:24.464
His name was Joey.

19:33.508 --> 19:36.276
I don't know what you're
expecting to find here,

19:36.309 --> 19:40.548
but this town isn't one
for opening up old wounds.

19:40.581 --> 19:42.550
The wound never healed, John.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.219
My son's body was never found.

19:47.454 --> 19:49.624
His case was left unsolved.

19:55.930 --> 19:58.700
There was a lot of talk
about what went wrong here.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.235
There was a lot of blame.

20:04.872 --> 20:08.609
You think you can move on
from something like that, but...

20:09.644 --> 20:11.612
I'm sorry for your loss.

20:12.914 --> 20:15.315
I feel for you.

20:15.348 --> 20:17.250
But some things are just...

20:22.322 --> 20:23.558
It was Jimmy Lipton.

20:24.357 --> 20:25.860
What was?

20:26.961 --> 20:28.996
The accident that you passed.

20:30.064 --> 20:31.599
Oh, God.

20:31.632 --> 20:32.667
That was him?

20:34.068 --> 20:34.902
Yeah.

20:36.003 --> 20:38.940
You're welcome to stay.

20:38.973 --> 20:40.608
At least till you get
sorted out.

22:17.839 --> 22:20.675
Driven the fire right up
the back of my daughter's place.

22:20.708 --> 22:22.442
- What, Jonno?
- Yeah.

22:22.475 --> 22:23.744
You're fucking joking.

22:23.778 --> 22:25.146
What are you having, love?

22:25.179 --> 22:27.582
Just a soda water and lime,
please.

22:27.615 --> 22:28.883
On the hard stuff, are ya?

22:30.518 --> 22:32.753
You must be that city girl, eh?

22:32.787 --> 22:33.855
Yeah.

22:35.990 --> 22:37.525
There we go.

22:41.762 --> 22:43.164
Here you go.

22:43.197 --> 22:44.497
Thanks.

22:44.532 --> 22:45.900
Ta.

22:47.969 --> 22:49.070
James Lipton.

22:49.103 --> 22:50.671
"Teabag" to his mates.

22:50.705 --> 22:52.540
Bloke who owned
the cottage you're in.

22:52.573 --> 22:54.141
Got a couple of divorces
under his belt,

22:54.175 --> 22:56.143
drank like a fucking fish.

22:56.177 --> 22:59.046
He did always want
to go out pissed.

22:59.080 --> 23:00.413
But I'd have
much rather seen him

23:00.447 --> 23:01.782
sitting there at that chair.

23:04.051 --> 23:05.519
So how is it?

23:05.553 --> 23:09.156
It's basic,
but I don't need much.

23:09.190 --> 23:10.758
Keep doing your meditations,
yeah?

23:10.791 --> 23:13.027
Yeah, no, I will,
I will, I will.

23:14.896 --> 23:17.598
Hold on a sec, darling.

23:17.632 --> 23:18.966
- Hi, John.
- Ellie and I were wondering

23:19.000 --> 23:21.836
if you want to come over
for food tonight.

23:21.869 --> 23:24.071
You're not forcing this
on her, are you?

23:24.105 --> 23:26.040
It was her idea.

23:26.073 --> 23:27.942
Okay, yeah,
that'd be lovely, thanks!

23:27.975 --> 23:29.911
6:30, hmm?

23:29.944 --> 23:31.979
Us oldies like to eat early.

23:55.937 --> 23:57.038
Oh, no, thanks.

23:57.071 --> 23:58.940
What, you don't drink?

23:58.973 --> 24:01.242
Oh, I drink.

24:01.275 --> 24:04.512
Ah, no worries.

24:04.545 --> 24:06.781
Oh, please, you go ahead!

24:09.083 --> 24:11.118
Well, not exactly a connoisseur,

24:11.152 --> 24:13.888
but I do love a good vino.

24:16.724 --> 24:19.060
Not fancy like you'd be used to
in the city,

24:19.093 --> 24:21.262
but just simple stuff.

24:21.295 --> 24:23.064
Smells delicious, thank you.

24:23.097 --> 24:26.100
Can't remember the last time
I had a home-cooked meal.

24:26.133 --> 24:28.135
Thank you, very kind.

24:29.770 --> 24:31.172
Not married, Hanna?

24:31.205 --> 24:32.807
Ellie.

24:32.840 --> 24:34.909
No, it's okay.

24:34.942 --> 24:36.677
I was.

24:36.711 --> 24:38.846
Phil and I separated
about a year ago.

24:38.879 --> 24:41.649
Wow. Sorry to hear that.

24:41.682 --> 24:43.250
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

24:47.788 --> 24:50.558
How old is your little girl?

24:53.327 --> 24:55.730
I saw the bike.

24:55.763 --> 24:58.265
I'm sorry, I just assumed
that the girl in the photograph

24:58.299 --> 25:00.167
was your daughter.

25:00.201 --> 25:03.571
Yes, she is.

25:03.604 --> 25:05.573
Her name's Violet.

25:07.975 --> 25:10.311
We couldn't have kids
of our own,

25:10.344 --> 25:13.848
so we ended up adopting.

25:13.881 --> 25:15.549
Didn't matter, though.

25:15.583 --> 25:19.954
She was ours from the moment
we laid eyes on her.

25:19.987 --> 25:21.622
Gift from God.

25:24.859 --> 25:26.193
She passed.

25:30.264 --> 25:31.665
I'm sorry.

25:31.699 --> 25:34.935
I just saw the bike.

25:34.969 --> 25:38.072
Why do you always have to talk
like she's gone?

25:39.306 --> 25:41.242
Because she is Elenor.

25:47.381 --> 25:49.050
Excuse me, please.

26:02.363 --> 26:05.166
Yeah, she was
our little darling.

26:07.001 --> 26:09.136
Beautiful in every way.

26:11.072 --> 26:13.074
Do you mind if I ask
how it happened?

26:17.244 --> 26:19.180
Not long after...

26:21.816 --> 26:24.752
everything that happened
with your boy,

26:24.785 --> 26:27.321
the bus bringing the kids
home from camp

26:27.354 --> 26:30.691
ran off the road
and into the river.

26:30.724 --> 26:34.128
Our Violet was
one of the girls that drowned.

26:36.063 --> 26:37.832
I am so sorry.

26:39.166 --> 26:41.135
I remember that happening.

26:43.304 --> 26:45.773
Happened right over there,

26:45.806 --> 26:47.308
at the side of the river.

26:50.444 --> 26:53.247
The only person who walked away
was the driver.

26:53.280 --> 26:55.282
Brake failure, they called it.

27:00.287 --> 27:03.290
I think we might
give her a minute, hmm?

27:04.825 --> 27:06.227
Do you like music?

27:07.328 --> 27:08.129
Yes.

27:13.134 --> 27:16.270
What are the red lights
on the other side of the river?

27:22.476 --> 27:24.979
It's a memorial.

27:25.012 --> 27:26.113
For the children?

27:26.147 --> 27:27.381
Yeah.

27:30.317 --> 27:32.186
Every family
on this side of the river

27:32.219 --> 27:35.256
lost a kid that day.

27:35.289 --> 27:38.159
The other side
turn on red lights

27:38.192 --> 27:40.995
to show us
they'll never be forgotten.

27:41.028 --> 27:43.164
That's lovely.

27:46.500 --> 27:48.202
I'm trying to move on.

27:49.737 --> 27:52.907
But for Ellie,

27:52.940 --> 27:54.441
it's like it happened
only yesterday.

33:31.513 --> 33:33.080
You're the last person
I expected to see

33:33.113 --> 33:35.783
back here in Billins.

33:35.817 --> 33:37.552
You and me both.

33:42.857 --> 33:46.426
So many grieving mothers.

33:46.460 --> 33:50.665
And the press in your face
all the time asking questions.

33:53.200 --> 33:54.602
No chance to grieve.

33:57.437 --> 34:00.240
Why did you stop
looking for my son?

34:05.445 --> 34:08.448
I tore up every inch
of this property.

34:08.482 --> 34:10.450
I even ripped the heart
out of that bamboo forest,

34:10.484 --> 34:12.419
most of
the surrounding property.

34:16.223 --> 34:19.426
Four families got
to bury their children.

34:19.459 --> 34:21.395
Guess they're the lucky ones.

34:22.864 --> 34:24.164
Lucky.

34:27.769 --> 34:29.637
You dropped the search.

34:31.204 --> 34:33.240
Too bloody hard to keep looking.

34:33.273 --> 34:34.809
Now, hang on.

34:34.842 --> 34:37.177
When Simpkin nicked himself
the state government,

34:37.210 --> 34:39.479
they stopped all money,
all manpower

34:39.514 --> 34:40.815
into that investigation.

34:40.848 --> 34:43.383
That was their call.

34:43.417 --> 34:46.320
Hanna, you look out there.

34:46.353 --> 34:49.657
Those cane fields go as far
as the eye can see.

34:49.691 --> 34:51.626
Right, now to get through that
at that time,

34:51.659 --> 34:52.760
we would've had
to have burned it

34:52.794 --> 34:54.127
before the harvest was ready.

34:54.161 --> 34:56.229
That's people's livelihoods.

34:56.263 --> 34:58.600
Joey is still out there.

35:05.172 --> 35:06.608
I wish I could help you,
Hanna, I do,

35:06.641 --> 35:09.844
but without new evidence,
I can't.

35:12.312 --> 35:17.752
Hanna, you can't keep poking
around here by yourself.

35:19.954 --> 35:22.289
Not everyone is friendly
in Billins.

35:24.792 --> 35:27.260
It could get serious.

35:44.746 --> 35:47.447
Life is in your hands.

35:47.481 --> 35:50.484
Find your courage
and know that you are here

35:50.518 --> 35:52.720
to serve the greater good.

35:54.889 --> 35:58.225
"Here, my love,"
they said to her,

35:58.258 --> 36:01.629
"it does not have
to be so dark.

36:01.663 --> 36:06.400
This will strengthen you
as you breathe in.

36:06.433 --> 36:08.468
My message for you, dear one,

36:08.503 --> 36:12.607
is of coming toward peace
and wholeness.

36:12.640 --> 36:15.810
Rise above
and search around you,

36:15.843 --> 36:19.346
radiate out from the light
across the fields

36:19.379 --> 36:23.918
where it was once dark
and closed inside.

36:23.951 --> 36:28.790
Explore and accept the wonder
and peace of these places.

36:28.823 --> 36:32.860
It is your best way
to find peace

36:32.894 --> 36:36.329
and to see the emotions,

36:36.363 --> 36:39.600
sensations of panic or fear."

40:01.936 --> 40:03.104
El.

40:07.842 --> 40:09.543
Come on, love.

40:13.681 --> 40:16.584
Hey? Okay?

40:16.617 --> 40:17.952
It's okay.

40:17.985 --> 40:19.787
Everything's okay.

41:14.675 --> 41:17.678
The currents can
sweep you away in life,

41:17.712 --> 41:22.083
thrashing and resisting
the flow of life.

41:22.116 --> 41:25.119
Where it hurts
and it is painful,

41:25.152 --> 41:29.757
that is when restlessness
and dissatisfaction take hold

41:29.790 --> 41:31.092
and shadow the lights,

41:31.125 --> 41:35.096
taking over body,
mind, and psych.

41:35.129 --> 41:39.300
It causes us to suffer
amnesia of the spirit.

41:39.333 --> 41:44.538
We must remind ourselves
to turn towards goodness again.

41:44.572 --> 41:48.809
We forget we have agency
and choice in the matter.

41:48.843 --> 41:51.545
And most heartbreaking,

41:51.579 --> 41:54.715
when we're caught
in our darkness,

41:54.749 --> 41:57.885
we forget how deeply we care
for our lives,

41:57.918 --> 42:02.723
our memories, and the now.

42:07.895 --> 42:11.632
...hope and light will coexist.

42:11.665 --> 42:15.336
So you must, in finding
the light from the darkness,

42:15.369 --> 42:19.140
be willing to take yourself
into the light

42:19.173 --> 42:23.077
and out of the shadows
of memories.

42:23.110 --> 42:27.848
The more you work at finding,
spreading, and teaching love,

42:27.882 --> 42:31.118
the less I will need
to hold you so tight.

42:31.152 --> 42:33.587
Don't be afraid to feel

42:33.621 --> 42:35.689
in your heart.

42:35.723 --> 42:38.059
I am but a fierce
and loyal reminder...

42:39.393 --> 42:40.861
Hey!

43:05.019 --> 43:08.155
No! Wait!

43:18.199 --> 43:20.167
Elenor!

43:20.201 --> 43:23.771
Bit early for you,
isn't it, Hanna?

43:23.804 --> 43:25.973
Where did they go?

43:26.006 --> 43:27.875
Who?

43:27.908 --> 43:29.076
The two boys
who came round here,

43:29.110 --> 43:30.978
where did they go?

43:31.011 --> 43:33.114
- Boys?
- Yeah.

43:37.017 --> 43:38.886
Better come with me.

43:38.919 --> 43:41.422
Well, did you see
where they went?

43:41.455 --> 43:42.923
Come on.

43:45.059 --> 43:47.294
John told me about your son.

43:48.996 --> 43:50.664
Elenor, did you see
where they went?

43:52.032 --> 43:54.702
But you need not worry, Hanna.

43:56.303 --> 43:58.305
Because he's an angel now.

43:59.940 --> 44:01.976
They are all angels.

44:03.744 --> 44:06.147
And they don't ever leave us.

44:11.418 --> 44:14.955
The cane's got a way
of making you feel small

44:14.989 --> 44:17.691
and alone.

44:17.725 --> 44:22.329
All that twisted nature
sprung from the earth,

44:22.363 --> 44:24.832
suffocating the light.

44:24.865 --> 44:28.369
Violet used to be
really scared of it.

44:31.238 --> 44:33.707
But she isn't anymore.

44:42.249 --> 44:44.818
You should have a lay down, hey?

44:44.852 --> 44:46.220
Get some rest.

44:46.253 --> 44:50.057
You'll feel much better later.

44:50.090 --> 44:51.926
Who were the boys, Elenor?

45:31.232 --> 45:32.399
Oh, God!

45:34.301 --> 45:35.402
Hanna.

45:35.436 --> 45:37.371
Hanna?

45:37.404 --> 45:39.340
Hanna. It's okay.

45:41.108 --> 45:43.077
- Just calm down.
- I saw... I saw...

45:47.481 --> 45:49.216
Now stay here.

46:22.617 --> 46:24.318
Here, hold on to this.

46:25.886 --> 46:27.988
Listen, Hanna,

46:28.022 --> 46:31.025
I think it's best
if you head back to the city.

46:31.058 --> 46:33.894
Coming here
might have been a mistake.

46:33.927 --> 46:35.229
Who is he?

46:36.564 --> 46:39.099
What aren't you telling me?

46:39.133 --> 46:42.903
What you saw is in your head,

46:42.936 --> 46:45.472
and that's the truth of it.

46:45.507 --> 46:48.942
If it was nothing,
why would a stupid red light

46:48.976 --> 46:50.578
be any help?

46:50.612 --> 46:52.346
Why would all those houses
over there

46:52.379 --> 46:54.882
hang red lanterns for nothing?

46:56.618 --> 47:01.288
You've got red headlights
on your bloody truck, John!

47:01.322 --> 47:04.291
Hanna, you're not to say
a word of this to Elenor.

47:04.325 --> 47:08.429
I do not want her riled up,
do you understand me?

47:08.462 --> 47:12.833
And you should seriously
consider going home.

47:17.104 --> 47:19.139
I'm not going anywhere, John.

47:49.169 --> 47:51.038
Hello?

48:39.086 --> 48:41.188
I'm... I'm so sorry.

48:45.192 --> 48:47.327
I'm so, so, so sorry.

50:05.840 --> 50:09.209
Mama!

50:34.702 --> 50:36.436
Hey, you've got through
to Julian.

50:36.470 --> 50:39.273
Sorry I can't take your call
right now...

51:04.298 --> 51:09.537
Not a person.

52:08.863 --> 52:10.397
Here you are.

52:10.430 --> 52:12.499
Soda and lime.

52:12.533 --> 52:15.302
Thanks.

52:15.335 --> 52:17.204
The farmer that just left.

52:17.237 --> 52:18.706
Oh, One-Nut Riley?

52:18.740 --> 52:21.909
Did he ever run cane
on the east side of the river?

52:21.943 --> 52:24.378
What's it to you?

52:24.411 --> 52:26.413
Did he ever work for him?

52:26.446 --> 52:28.348
You gotta be fuckin' kiddin',
haven't you?

52:28.382 --> 52:29.517
No. I'm not.

52:29.550 --> 52:31.385
Did he ever work
on Riley's farm?

52:31.418 --> 52:35.823
No, everybody knows Simpkin
worked on the Drakes' land.

52:35.857 --> 52:37.725
- The Drakes?
- That's until they found out

52:37.759 --> 52:39.426
who he was.

52:46.500 --> 52:48.569
Wait, where you going?

52:48.603 --> 52:51.706
You... you haven't touched
your drink!

52:53.340 --> 52:55.843
Ehh.

52:55.877 --> 52:59.847
Simpkin worked for you.

52:59.881 --> 53:01.214
You forgot to mention that.

53:05.520 --> 53:08.589
You're wasting your time.

53:08.623 --> 53:10.858
Police have gone down
this road.

53:12.560 --> 53:16.664
No offense,
but they did a shit job.

53:20.500 --> 53:24.304
Simpkin worked for
a lot of people around here.

53:24.337 --> 53:25.573
Like who?

53:25.606 --> 53:30.011
Jimmy Lipton, for one.

53:30.044 --> 53:32.379
Tom Evans.

53:32.412 --> 53:34.549
Tom Evans?

53:34.582 --> 53:36.584
Yeah.

53:36.617 --> 53:38.485
The bus driver.

53:51.032 --> 53:53.968
You knew Leonard Simpkin.

53:54.001 --> 53:55.402
What about him?

53:55.435 --> 53:57.638
I need to find
where he hid my son.

53:59.574 --> 54:02.810
Hid.

54:02.844 --> 54:05.513
Nice way to put it.

54:05.546 --> 54:07.582
Please, Tom.

54:07.615 --> 54:08.850
Anything you can tell me,

54:08.883 --> 54:10.685
anything he might have said
to you.

54:20.762 --> 54:23.831
Brake failure?

54:23.865 --> 54:25.700
Is that what really happened?

54:25.733 --> 54:27.935
What the hell does it matter?
It happened.

54:40.882 --> 54:42.550
Tom.

54:54.695 --> 54:56.063
There's not a day
that's gone past

54:56.097 --> 54:57.632
where I haven't
counted the seconds

54:57.665 --> 55:00.601
where maybe I could have
gone back and helped with

55:00.635 --> 55:02.603
her suitcase.

55:15.983 --> 55:17.618
Clay's boy Max.

55:22.455 --> 55:25.126
Came out on the road
right in front of me.

55:25.159 --> 55:29.396
I had to lock the wheel
to miss him, and...

55:29.429 --> 55:31.632
...and the bus was sideways.

55:31.666 --> 55:33.400
Upside down.

55:33.433 --> 55:35.570
Underwater.

55:35.603 --> 55:38.005
The bus sank so fast
that those poor kids had

55:38.039 --> 55:39.941
absolutely no idea
what was going on

55:39.974 --> 55:41.943
before they drowned.

55:45.046 --> 55:46.848
How did you get out?

55:48.115 --> 55:49.750
Got lucky.

55:53.955 --> 55:55.488
Door was smashed.

57:46.934 --> 57:49.203
Coming!

57:54.675 --> 57:56.210
I thought we could have
a cup of tea.

57:59.747 --> 58:02.616
You believe you're gonna
find him, don't you?

58:04.885 --> 58:06.921
You know,

58:06.954 --> 58:08.956
when they brought me
into that hospital

58:08.990 --> 58:12.126
to identify Violet,

58:12.159 --> 58:16.964
I didn't know
who I was looking at.

58:16.998 --> 58:23.604
She was so cold, so blue!

58:23.637 --> 58:26.907
I knew it wasn't really her.

58:26.941 --> 58:30.644
The body is just a vessel
for the spirit.

58:30.678 --> 58:35.049
I mean, it can't be just this,

58:35.082 --> 58:37.818
there's gotta be more than...

58:37.852 --> 58:40.788
You believe that, don't you?

58:40.821 --> 58:47.595
I admire people with faith,
I do.

58:47.628 --> 58:49.797
I've just never had it.

58:52.266 --> 58:55.102
If that were true,

58:55.136 --> 58:57.738
you wouldn't be here, though.

58:57.772 --> 59:01.108
Would you?

59:01.142 --> 59:05.679
I talk to Violet all the time.

59:05.713 --> 59:08.883
She shows me things.

59:08.916 --> 59:11.886
Is that what you were doing,

59:11.919 --> 59:15.156
out in the fields at night,

59:15.189 --> 59:16.724
seeing Violet?

59:19.193 --> 59:24.098
We were supposed to harvest
that very field

59:24.131 --> 59:26.867
the day after the accident.

59:26.901 --> 59:28.936
But now, we never will.

59:35.743 --> 59:40.648
You saw them, didn't you,
out in the field?

59:40.681 --> 59:45.820
Oh, Elenor...

59:45.853 --> 59:49.657
I don't know what I saw.

59:49.690 --> 59:54.295
You don't have to find Joey,
Hanna.

59:54.328 --> 59:56.831
He's gonna find you.

1:00:36.971 --> 1:00:40.941
Whaddya got?

1:00:40.975 --> 1:00:44.411
That'll get you
a shitload of Oxys.

1:00:44.445 --> 1:00:46.347
Chuck some valiums in there
as well, if you want.

1:00:46.380 --> 1:00:48.015
- No.
- No?

1:00:48.048 --> 1:00:49.383
Or you want some pot?

1:00:49.416 --> 1:00:50.951
No.

1:00:50.985 --> 1:00:52.286
Well, horse is pretty popular
around here.

1:00:52.319 --> 1:00:54.288
Yeah, I bet.

1:00:54.321 --> 1:00:55.689
Well, I'll take that
and I'll meet you

1:00:55.723 --> 1:00:57.958
around the corner here.

1:00:57.992 --> 1:00:59.360
No, just joking,
here you go.

1:00:59.393 --> 1:01:01.362
- Have a good night, then.
- Yeah, funny.

1:01:01.395 --> 1:01:03.364
Nice to see you again.

1:02:05.560 --> 1:02:07.861
Shut up.

1:02:13.100 --> 1:02:16.804
Shut up!

1:03:22.436 --> 1:03:24.338
Oh my God!

1:04:03.243 --> 1:04:04.378
This them?

1:04:06.347 --> 1:04:09.316
They could be
any kid's shoes, Hanna.

1:04:09.350 --> 1:04:12.654
I know his shoes.

1:04:12.687 --> 1:04:15.222
They're Joey's.

1:04:15.255 --> 1:04:17.491
He was wearing them that day.

1:04:17.525 --> 1:04:19.293
Hanna, word's gotten around,

1:04:19.326 --> 1:04:22.096
if you didn't know already.

1:04:22.129 --> 1:04:23.997
Someone's trying
to prank you.

1:04:24.031 --> 1:04:25.332
- Hmph.
- They're trying

1:04:25.366 --> 1:04:27.301
to scare you off.

1:04:27.334 --> 1:04:31.038
You need to drop this here,
go home.

1:04:31.071 --> 1:04:35.376
Look at yourself.

1:04:35.409 --> 1:04:38.412
No good for your health.

1:04:38.445 --> 1:04:42.449
How could anyone possibly know

1:04:42.483 --> 1:04:46.453
what shoes he was wearing
that day?

1:04:46.487 --> 1:04:50.324
I'm not leaving, constable.

1:04:50.357 --> 1:04:52.459
Not without my son.

1:04:55.996 --> 1:05:00.000
I'll send them to the city
for testing.

1:05:00.033 --> 1:05:01.969
But if nothing comes back,

1:05:02.002 --> 1:05:04.171
you have to put an end to this.

1:05:07.241 --> 1:05:09.343
Don't touch them!

1:05:09.376 --> 1:05:13.247
Shouldn't you use gloves
or something?

1:05:13.280 --> 1:05:15.683
God, you idiot!

1:05:15.717 --> 1:05:18.218
Now, you listen to me.

1:05:18.252 --> 1:05:20.954
You wanna run around here
stirring up shit,

1:05:20.988 --> 1:05:24.124
then I will not think twice
about driving you out of town.

1:05:24.158 --> 1:05:26.126
Do you understand me?

1:05:26.160 --> 1:05:28.663
This property wasn't searched.

1:05:28.696 --> 1:05:30.497
Not like the others.

1:05:30.532 --> 1:05:33.033
- This field...
- Okay, stop!

1:05:35.502 --> 1:05:41.241
This place will drive you
fucking mad.

1:05:41.275 --> 1:05:45.012
Trust me.

1:05:45.045 --> 1:05:48.716
You've gotta let it go.

1:05:48.750 --> 1:05:53.487
If it was your son...

1:05:53.521 --> 1:05:56.123
would you let it go?

1:07:46.768 --> 1:07:52.807
Oh! My Tommy, my baby!

1:07:52.840 --> 1:07:56.109
Ohh!

1:07:56.143 --> 1:08:00.314
Mommy's here to see you.

1:08:18.498 --> 1:08:19.601
- He's out there!
- Who?

1:08:19.634 --> 1:08:21.636
- The boy!
- What boy?

1:08:21.669 --> 1:08:22.870
- Max!
- Hanna!

1:08:22.904 --> 1:08:24.906
I saw Max.

1:08:24.939 --> 1:08:26.373
You're losin' it.

1:08:26.406 --> 1:08:28.610
I'm not fucking losing it!

1:08:28.643 --> 1:08:31.178
I know what I saw!

1:08:31.211 --> 1:08:32.647
They're all in there

1:08:32.680 --> 1:08:34.481
with the children.

1:08:35.850 --> 1:08:38.753
I saw Violet, John.

1:08:38.786 --> 1:08:44.224
I saw her with my own eyes.

1:08:44.257 --> 1:08:47.595
You need to come with me
and get help.

1:08:47.629 --> 1:08:49.396
Get off!

1:08:49.429 --> 1:08:52.399
I'm quite capable
of walking by myself.

1:08:52.432 --> 1:08:54.267
You're the one
with the limp.

1:09:00.942 --> 1:09:04.311
My wife isn't well, Hanna.

1:09:04.344 --> 1:09:06.814
And having you
out in the fields,

1:09:06.848 --> 1:09:08.683
it's making her anxious.

1:09:08.716 --> 1:09:12.587
Someone put my son's shoes

1:09:12.620 --> 1:09:16.524
out on the back porch.

1:09:16.557 --> 1:09:18.760
They're letting me know
he's here.

1:09:21.929 --> 1:09:30.505
Tomorrow, I want you
to pack your bags...

1:09:30.538 --> 1:09:32.507
and I want you gone.

1:09:36.443 --> 1:09:38.278
How you holding up?

1:09:38.311 --> 1:09:39.647
Sticking to the plan,
I hope,

1:09:39.681 --> 1:09:41.448
staying out of the pubs.

1:09:41.481 --> 1:09:43.785
A hundred percent.

1:09:43.818 --> 1:09:45.820
Good.

1:09:45.853 --> 1:09:47.722
Anything to report?

1:09:55.963 --> 1:09:58.633
Everyone in this town
is a liar.

1:10:34.401 --> 1:10:36.704
Hello?

1:10:36.738 --> 1:10:39.507
Sorry.

1:10:39.540 --> 1:10:41.374
No... no, no, please wait.

1:10:41.408 --> 1:10:42.543
Please wait.

1:10:45.345 --> 1:10:48.015
I need to ask you about Max.

1:10:50.918 --> 1:10:52.687
Please.

1:10:52.720 --> 1:10:55.790
I lost my boy too.

1:11:11.906 --> 1:11:13.775
Tell me about your son.

1:11:16.811 --> 1:11:21.448
Why did the paper say
that Max was on that bus?

1:11:21.481 --> 1:11:24.886
He wasn't.

1:11:24.919 --> 1:11:28.823
Wilkins said
he tried to flag it down

1:11:28.856 --> 1:11:32.026
to get a lift home,

1:11:32.059 --> 1:11:35.428
but Tommy Evans knew Max.

1:11:35.462 --> 1:11:38.599
He would've stopped for him.

1:11:38.633 --> 1:11:41.301
So...

1:12:02.623 --> 1:12:07.427
So, Simpkin was working
the Drake farm that season.

1:12:11.431 --> 1:12:12.834
Have you been out
to the fields...

1:12:12.867 --> 1:12:17.138
I mean, since the accident.

1:12:17.171 --> 1:12:20.842
I know what goes on out there
with that lot.

1:12:28.049 --> 1:12:30.483
I saw Max

1:12:30.518 --> 1:12:31.886
in the fields.

1:12:35.455 --> 1:12:38.860
What you've seen is not my son.

1:12:58.646 --> 1:12:59.914
Violet!

1:13:11.659 --> 1:13:12.894
Violet!

1:15:09.643 --> 1:15:13.714
- Max wants you to leave.
- Jesus Christ!

1:15:13.748 --> 1:15:17.151
Or he'll hurt you.

1:15:17.184 --> 1:15:20.788
Violet!

1:15:20.821 --> 1:15:23.257
What do you want?

1:15:23.290 --> 1:15:26.961
I'll help you find
what you're looking for.

1:15:29.630 --> 1:15:34.001
Joey.

1:15:34.035 --> 1:15:37.104
Do you know where he is,
Violet?

1:15:37.138 --> 1:15:39.573
I can't go where he is.

1:15:41.809 --> 1:15:44.879
But I want to.

1:15:44.912 --> 1:15:49.016
He said you should
remember his shoes.

1:15:49.050 --> 1:15:51.152
Please, Violet.

1:15:51.185 --> 1:15:53.354
Show me where he is.

1:15:55.289 --> 1:15:58.726
I have to go now.

1:15:58.759 --> 1:15:59.894
No, wait!

1:16:15.042 --> 1:16:17.211
Shh!

1:17:26.313 --> 1:17:28.415
Run!

1:17:51.238 --> 1:17:53.807
I-I want to help you.

1:18:00.014 --> 1:18:04.318
Tell... tell me what you want.

1:19:09.817 --> 1:19:11.352
How you doing?

1:19:16.156 --> 1:19:19.260
How'd that stuff I got you
go the other day?

1:19:19.293 --> 1:19:20.928
What do you want, Troy?

1:19:26.400 --> 1:19:30.804
I was actually gonna ask,
um...

1:19:30.838 --> 1:19:35.175
if you wanted
to come get high with me.

1:19:40.615 --> 1:19:42.149
Why not?

1:19:52.993 --> 1:19:54.928
Come on, then.

1:20:30.397 --> 1:20:32.866
I thought better, that.

1:20:43.977 --> 1:20:46.413
I always thought
I'd get out of Billins,

1:20:46.447 --> 1:20:48.082
you know what I mean?

1:20:48.115 --> 1:20:49.416
Why didn't you?

1:20:49.450 --> 1:20:53.053
Oh, things took a turn,
didn't they? Yeah.

1:20:53.087 --> 1:20:55.422
What kind of a turn?

1:20:55.456 --> 1:20:58.292
Lost my little sister.

1:20:58.325 --> 1:21:00.160
Oh.

1:21:00.194 --> 1:21:03.197
Shit. Sorry.

1:21:03.230 --> 1:21:05.265
She meant everything to me.

1:21:05.299 --> 1:21:08.001
Mm.

1:21:08.035 --> 1:21:13.608
Bus crash,
just there out front.

1:21:20.013 --> 1:21:22.650
I still see her, though.

1:21:24.485 --> 1:21:26.086
I'm not gonna let her go,
you know what I mean?

1:21:26.120 --> 1:21:28.956
She's still here with me,
she's here, she's here,

1:21:28.989 --> 1:21:30.357
she's here.

1:21:30.391 --> 1:21:32.326
Won't leave her behind,
do you know what I mean?

1:21:38.633 --> 1:21:42.570
We've got something
pretty special

1:21:42.604 --> 1:21:45.272
going on here.

1:21:49.443 --> 1:21:51.278
And you...

1:21:55.282 --> 1:21:57.317
...are messing with it.

1:22:02.022 --> 1:22:03.090
Do you get me?

1:22:03.123 --> 1:22:04.458
- Okay, Troy.
- Huh?

1:22:04.491 --> 1:22:07.294
I...

1:22:07.327 --> 1:22:11.265
I think you should leave.

1:22:11.298 --> 1:22:14.669
You think I should leave!

1:22:14.702 --> 1:22:16.336
You want me to leave?

1:22:19.239 --> 1:22:21.543
- No, I'm not gonna...
- Just leave.

1:22:21.576 --> 1:22:23.410
No, you fucking leave,
you fucking leave, right?

1:22:23.444 --> 1:22:24.311
We'll go back
to your fucking room now

1:22:24.344 --> 1:22:26.313
and we'll pack
the fucking bag, right?

1:22:26.346 --> 1:22:27.715
Right?

1:22:27.749 --> 1:22:29.416
You fucking joke.

1:22:32.252 --> 1:22:33.755
...is go and pack
your fucking shit

1:22:33.788 --> 1:22:35.355
and fuck off, you dog.

1:22:35.389 --> 1:22:37.124
Do you understand
where I'm coming from?

1:22:37.157 --> 1:22:40.093
Hey? Do you understand
where I'm coming from?

1:22:41.563 --> 1:22:44.566
Let her go, now.

1:22:47.535 --> 1:22:49.737
Brother?

1:22:55.476 --> 1:22:59.112
If I ever see you
back here again,

1:22:59.146 --> 1:23:02.617
I will fucking kill you.

1:23:22.236 --> 1:23:24.772
Go on, get!

1:23:24.806 --> 1:23:26.608
Fucking dog.

1:23:34.281 --> 1:23:36.483
John!

1:23:36.518 --> 1:23:38.820
- What's going on?
- Everything's okay.

1:23:38.853 --> 1:23:41.789
Just go back to the house.

1:24:05.780 --> 1:24:07.114
You okay?

1:24:35.442 --> 1:24:40.480
Your son...

1:24:40.515 --> 1:24:45.520
killed my son.

1:24:48.155 --> 1:24:51.191
Yes, he did.

1:25:00.300 --> 1:25:05.205
He was broken.

1:25:05.238 --> 1:25:07.742
But he was mine.

1:25:10.612 --> 1:25:15.482
He was my boy.

1:25:15.516 --> 1:25:17.752
And I don't know
what to say to you,

1:25:17.785 --> 1:25:21.355
other than I'm sorry.

1:25:26.193 --> 1:25:27.862
So sorry.

1:25:32.265 --> 1:25:36.236
Did Elenor know
he was yours?

1:25:36.269 --> 1:25:37.839
No.

1:25:40.541 --> 1:25:44.579
It was my sin,

1:25:44.612 --> 1:25:46.781
my guilt to carry.

1:25:55.757 --> 1:25:57.324
On the day of the accident...

1:26:01.763 --> 1:26:04.565
...that's when I found out
who Lenny really was.

1:26:19.446 --> 1:26:22.449
John!

1:26:22.482 --> 1:26:24.451
Help!

1:26:24.484 --> 1:26:26.821
John! Please!

1:26:26.854 --> 1:26:28.523
I couldn't keep up.

1:26:28.556 --> 1:26:32.760
I... I tried,
but my leg.

1:26:35.797 --> 1:26:36.597
No!

1:26:36.631 --> 1:26:41.401
I yelled out,
I kept yelling, I...

1:26:41.435 --> 1:26:43.671
I tried to stop him.

1:26:43.705 --> 1:26:46.541
No!

1:27:03.057 --> 1:27:05.258
But I just couldn't get to him.

1:27:16.503 --> 1:27:20.240
You have to burn the field,
John.

1:27:24.846 --> 1:27:28.649
My son's in that field.

1:27:28.683 --> 1:27:31.853
You don't know that.

1:27:34.789 --> 1:27:36.991
Violet showed me.

1:27:39.426 --> 1:27:41.361
Ellie won't let the field go.

1:27:44.065 --> 1:27:48.803
It's all she's got.

1:27:48.836 --> 1:27:51.338
I can't take that away from her.

1:27:54.642 --> 1:27:56.878
Violet wants to leave.

1:27:56.911 --> 1:27:59.847
- Oh, you're just saying that.
- No.

1:27:59.881 --> 1:28:03.751
John, look at me.

1:28:03.785 --> 1:28:04.986
Look at me.

1:28:08.421 --> 1:28:12.693
It's what she wants.

1:28:12.727 --> 1:28:15.462
She told me.

1:28:17.497 --> 1:28:18.966
Let her go.

1:28:23.470 --> 1:28:24.906
If I burn the field,

1:28:24.939 --> 1:28:29.677
they can't see their kids
anymore.

1:28:29.710 --> 1:28:32.647
It's time to let her go.

1:28:39.954 --> 1:28:41.556
Not tonight.

1:28:41.589 --> 1:28:43.925
I'm fine.

1:28:46.928 --> 1:28:48.963
We both need our sleep, love.

1:28:50.898 --> 1:28:54.434
I am fine.

1:28:56.871 --> 1:29:01.576
How long is this gonna
go on for?

1:30:02.236 --> 1:30:04.138
Oh God.

1:30:04.171 --> 1:30:07.141
Elenor!

1:30:07.174 --> 1:30:08.542
John!

1:30:08.576 --> 1:30:09.810
John.

1:30:18.619 --> 1:30:20.554
Come on, John!

1:30:23.157 --> 1:30:26.193
Elenor!

1:30:26.227 --> 1:30:30.031
Come on, come on!

1:30:30.064 --> 1:30:32.833
Elenor!

1:30:32.867 --> 1:30:34.568
- Elenor!
- John!

1:30:34.602 --> 1:30:35.870
Call an ambulance!

1:30:35.903 --> 1:30:37.738
John, John!

1:30:41.175 --> 1:30:42.743
John!

1:30:42.777 --> 1:30:44.078
What's happened?

1:30:44.111 --> 1:30:48.215
John! John! John!

1:30:48.249 --> 1:30:49.850
What are you doing?

1:30:53.521 --> 1:30:55.189
No!

1:32:19.940 --> 1:32:22.043
No...

1:33:10.424 --> 1:33:12.660
Violet!

1:33:16.931 --> 1:33:19.934
I haven't said goodbye.

1:33:22.002 --> 1:33:23.671
I haven't said goodbye!

1:33:34.115 --> 1:33:36.383
If I can take her...

1:33:36.417 --> 1:33:39.386
- No.
- Violet! Oh, Violet!

1:33:39.420 --> 1:33:41.188
No, no... I'm sorry.

1:33:46.060 --> 1:33:49.096
I tried to say goodbye!

1:33:51.732 --> 1:33:54.034
Why?

1:36:20.881 --> 1:36:23.917
Bury it with Nan, right?

1:36:23.951 --> 1:36:27.354
Right.

1:36:27.388 --> 1:36:29.456
I didn't know
if you'd want to see me.

1:36:33.027 --> 1:36:37.364
Thanks for letting me stay on.

1:36:37.398 --> 1:36:41.035
No worries.

1:36:41.068 --> 1:36:42.903
You gonna be okay?

1:36:48.375 --> 1:36:51.845
I am so sor...
I am so sorry.

1:36:51.879 --> 1:36:53.881
I am so sorry.
