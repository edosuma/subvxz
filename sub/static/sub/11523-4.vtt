00:12.804 --> 00:13.888
Excuse me, ma'am?

00:13.972 --> 00:15.390
Wha...

00:16.641 --> 00:18.435
I'm looking for Titus Andromedon.

00:18.518 --> 00:20.020
Oh, yeah?

00:20.103 --> 00:21.143
What do you want with him?

00:22.397 --> 00:24.482
- You Italian?
- Um, yeah.

00:24.566 --> 00:27.652
He and I have some personal business
to attend to.

00:27.736 --> 00:29.904
No, if this is about what he did

00:29.988 --> 00:33.366
in that Sbarro bathroom,
I understand the Sbarro family

00:33.450 --> 00:35.452
must feel deeply disrespected,

00:35.535 --> 00:37.537
but there's no need for a revenge killing.

00:37.620 --> 00:38.681
No, no, no, it's just a date.

00:38.705 --> 00:39.724
We're going on a date tonight.

00:39.748 --> 00:41.166
It's my first gay date, lady.

00:41.249 --> 00:43.752
Well, what do you know?

00:43.835 --> 00:45.712
Lillian Kaushtupper:

00:45.795 --> 00:46.713
landlord,

00:46.796 --> 00:47.630
Aquarius,

00:47.714 --> 00:48.631
cat collector.

00:48.715 --> 00:49.841
Mikey Politano:

00:49.924 --> 00:51.426
uh, construction worker,

00:51.509 --> 00:52.927
Mets fan,

00:53.011 --> 00:54.471
bad at lists.

00:54.554 --> 00:55.680
Yeah.

00:55.764 --> 00:57.766
Let's go surprise Titus.

00:57.849 --> 01:00.769
No!

01:00.852 --> 01:03.063
Lillian, you cannot bring
gentlemen callers in

01:03.146 --> 01:04.480
four hours early.

01:04.563 --> 01:05.899
I am not yet a butterfly.

01:05.982 --> 01:07.025
I'm just cocoon goo.

01:07.108 --> 01:09.486
Eh, it's always cocoon goo with you.

01:09.569 --> 01:11.488
Hey, I know you.

01:11.571 --> 01:12.447
Remember?

01:12.530 --> 01:14.449
I was walking by your construction site,

01:14.532 --> 01:16.743
and you said you wanted to be my jeans.

01:16.826 --> 01:17.994
So what happened?

01:18.078 --> 01:19.287
Did you ever get to be jeans?

01:19.370 --> 01:20.830
Kim-estic worker,

01:20.914 --> 01:22.514
please grab me a towel out of the dryer.

01:24.042 --> 01:24.876
Dang it!

01:24.959 --> 01:27.420
Now where are we gonna store
this oven door?

01:28.296 --> 01:29.297
In the oven.

01:29.380 --> 01:32.258
Hang on. I can, uh, fix that for you.

01:33.134 --> 01:34.469
Ooh, la-di-da.

01:34.552 --> 01:36.387
A functioning oven.

01:36.471 --> 01:39.766
Next thing you know, this tugboat...
I mean building.

01:39.849 --> 01:42.977
This is a normal apartment building,
everybody.

01:44.896 --> 01:46.064
Look, I'm sorry to bug you,

01:46.147 --> 01:48.027
but I just got a couple questions
about tonight.

01:48.066 --> 01:50.068
Like, how late do you think
we're gonna be out?

01:50.151 --> 01:52.028
Midnight, eastern gay time,
which is 3:00 a.m.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.447
And if we go to a gay bar,
can I get a beer?

01:54.531 --> 01:56.133
And which one of us
opens doors for the other?

01:56.157 --> 01:57.157
Or are there no doors?

01:57.200 --> 01:58.827
- Do we not use doors?
- Whoo.

01:58.910 --> 02:00.429
You got to make like
a 30-year-old single girl

02:00.453 --> 02:01.287
and settle.

02:01.371 --> 02:02.872
Can you help me pick out an outfit?

02:04.040 --> 02:06.876
First of all, outfits normally pick you.

02:08.044 --> 02:09.545
Basic.

02:10.505 --> 02:11.505
Basic.

02:13.174 --> 02:14.008
Bah-sic.

02:14.092 --> 02:15.802
How does a Patriots shirt not work?

02:15.885 --> 02:17.428
Those guys are so freaking gay!

02:17.512 --> 02:19.097
You need my Ex-Box.

02:22.267 --> 02:24.307
This is where I keep all the junk
that was left here

02:24.352 --> 02:26.813
by heartbroken exes, part-time lovers,

02:26.896 --> 02:29.524
Amish boys on Rumspringa, and So Ahn,

02:29.607 --> 02:31.734
a contortionist
with the Korean national circus.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.778
Now, which incarnation of Madonna

02:33.862 --> 02:35.572
do you most identify with?

02:35.655 --> 02:36.865
There are wrong answers.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.875
Okay, turn around.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.670
Now walk a little for me.

02:51.796 --> 02:52.839
Mm-hmm.

02:54.549 --> 02:55.758
And I'll see you tonight.

02:55.842 --> 02:58.219
Hey, thanks for all the help.

02:58.303 --> 03:00.096
Pardon my French, but le foop.

03:00.179 --> 03:02.682
I knew Mikey was new,
but that boy's a baby.

03:02.765 --> 03:05.977
This is going to be like Beethoven
making love to a baby.

03:06.060 --> 03:07.353
Ah, come on.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.188
He has a real job,

03:09.272 --> 03:12.650
and he's got a picture of his mom
in his wallet.

03:12.734 --> 03:15.612
Ooh. Now, that's what I call a MILF.

03:15.695 --> 03:16.755
Don't tell us what you think
it stands for.

03:16.779 --> 03:19.324
- My Interesting Lady Friend!
- We already know it's wrong!

03:19.407 --> 03:21.326
I'm just saying,

03:21.409 --> 03:23.328
the boys you usually go out with,

03:23.411 --> 03:24.537
they got things like...

03:24.621 --> 03:28.791
Oh, a loyalty card for genital piercing.

03:28.875 --> 03:32.795
And your boyfriends are so great, Lillian.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.672
What's-his-name threw a hammer at me.

03:34.756 --> 03:36.299
His name is Robert Durst,

03:36.382 --> 03:39.385
and he only did that 'cause he likes you.

03:47.936 --> 03:49.145
Ooh.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.063
Hi, Cyndee.

03:50.146 --> 03:51.773
Hiya, Kimmy. It's Cyndee Pokorny.

03:51.856 --> 03:53.358
We put a madman in jail together?

03:53.441 --> 03:55.109
Yes, Cyndee, I remember you.

03:55.193 --> 03:57.612
Okay, I just electronic-mailed you

03:57.695 --> 03:59.572
a video that you've got to watch
right away.

03:59.656 --> 04:00.823
It's real important.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.134
I'll call you from the library.

04:04.160 --> 04:06.120
Okay, Cyndee, I'm on the World Wide Web.

04:06.204 --> 04:07.747
I see your electronic mail.

04:07.830 --> 04:09.749
Good, but watch out for porns.

04:09.832 --> 04:11.584
Time to surf.

04:11.668 --> 04:13.145
<i>Welcome to </i> Innerwaves,

04:28.977 --> 04:30.979
Just wait. You're so impatient.

04:31.062 --> 04:32.623
I remember you wanted
to get out of the bunker,

04:32.647 --> 04:34.649
like, three days after you were kidnapped.

04:34.732 --> 04:37.235

How could she do this?

05:10.476 --> 05:11.728
Keep watching.

05:11.811 --> 05:13.622
There's a cat on the boat
who's friends with a bunny.

05:13.646 --> 05:15.189
That's why I'm calling.

05:15.273 --> 05:16.107
No.

05:16.190 --> 05:17.334
Fifteen years in that bunker,

05:17.358 --> 05:19.086
and this is what she's gonna do
with her life?

05:19.110 --> 05:20.445
Follow some other lunatic?

05:20.528 --> 05:22.196
Well, what can you do about it?

06:23.049 --> 06:25.426
Oh, Lillian, later tonight,

06:25.510 --> 06:27.887
after Mikey and I "choose to be gay"
a couple of times,

06:27.970 --> 06:29.448
I'm gonna need your help kicking him out.

06:29.472 --> 06:31.557
Just run into my bedroom and say...

06:31.641 --> 06:33.351
I don't know... Billy Joel's outside.

06:33.434 --> 06:34.434
Come on.

06:34.477 --> 06:37.313
You're already figuring out
how to get rid of him?

06:37.396 --> 06:38.396
You know how I roll.

06:38.439 --> 06:39.625
And I'm not talking about the time

06:39.649 --> 06:41.609
I fell into a trash can on top of a hill.

06:41.692 --> 06:44.195
Well, I don't want to do
your dirty work, Titus.

06:44.278 --> 06:45.780
I like Mikey.

06:45.863 --> 06:47.824
Who cares if you like Mikey?

06:47.907 --> 06:49.218
I'm the one who'd have to <i>Queer Eye</i>

06:49.242 --> 06:50.701
that bridge-and-tunnel tadpole.

06:50.785 --> 06:52.495
I can't take on a project like that.

06:52.578 --> 06:54.330
I'm just one man.

06:54.413 --> 06:56.207
That show had five guys.

06:56.290 --> 06:58.334
Speaking of Five Guys, I want a hamburger.

06:58.417 --> 06:59.418
But, Titus...

06:59.502 --> 07:00.503
No buts...

07:00.586 --> 07:01.586
yet.

07:02.547 --> 07:03.923
Thanking you.

07:04.966 --> 07:06.467
See you in the morning.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.945
You're the boss, sign.

07:36.122 --> 07:37.707
Hello?

07:37.790 --> 07:38.708
Intervention!

07:38.791 --> 07:39.625
Kimmy?

07:39.709 --> 07:40.710
What are you doing?

07:40.793 --> 07:41.919
I'm kidnapping you!

07:42.003 --> 07:43.880
And now I get why the reverend had a van.

07:43.963 --> 07:45.548
Ah!

07:45.631 --> 07:47.467
Your legs are so strong.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.302
I have access to steps now.

07:49.385 --> 07:50.571
And your breath is much better.

07:50.595 --> 07:51.429
Thank you.

07:51.512 --> 07:53.306
My new toothbrush is only for teeth!

07:54.724 --> 07:56.142
You can get off me, Kimmy.

07:56.225 --> 07:58.102
The boat's halfway to Mercury by now.

07:59.103 --> 08:00.730
What happened to you after the trial?

08:00.813 --> 08:02.231
I thought you were free at last,

08:02.315 --> 08:04.251
like a second cheese pizza
on Martin Luther King Day.

08:04.275 --> 08:05.151
Well, after the trial,

08:05.234 --> 08:07.111
first I got a job at the Apple Store.

08:07.195 --> 08:08.395
You know who loves that place?

08:08.446 --> 08:09.280
Horses.

08:09.363 --> 08:10.923
Oh, no, not the Durnsville Apple Store.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.617
The computer one in Indianapolis.

08:12.700 --> 08:13.910
It was wonderful.

08:13.993 --> 08:16.579
It was white and clean,
and we all dressed the same.

08:16.662 --> 08:18.302
Sounds like your brand of strawberry jam.

08:18.372 --> 08:19.207
Oh, definitely.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.626
Every day, we would meet
in a giant glass cube,

08:21.709 --> 08:23.336
and I gave the geniuses all my money

08:23.419 --> 08:25.004
in exchange for this magic watch.

08:25.087 --> 08:27.673
And then they excommunicated me
for eating Sheryl's yogurt,

08:27.757 --> 08:29.967
and that's when I found Cosmetology.

08:30.051 --> 08:31.719
But you don't need Cosmetology

08:31.802 --> 08:33.929
or Apple and all their cool products.

08:34.931 --> 08:37.350
I have an app that makes me sound
like different celebrities.

08:37.433 --> 08:40.162
<i>I have an app that
makes me sound like different celebrities.</i>

08:40.186 --> 08:41.854
That's Steve "Buskumeye."

08:41.938 --> 08:45.816
I know, down in the bunker,
we weren't friends.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.568
But I care about you.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.820
After what we went through,
the four of us are sisters.

08:49.904 --> 08:50.821
The four of us, Kimmy?

08:50.905 --> 08:53.324
- What about Lil' Lisa?
- Are you serious?

08:53.407 --> 08:55.868
Gretchen, Lil' Lisa was just the reverend

08:55.952 --> 08:57.703
dressed like a girl trying to find out

08:57.787 --> 08:59.181
what we were saying behind his back.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.165
No, her voice was way higher.

09:01.249 --> 09:04.877
The reverend was a psycho liar
who claimed he came up

09:04.961 --> 09:07.421
with the "buy the world a Coke"
commercial.

09:08.339 --> 09:10.675
You know he wasted half your life, right?

09:10.758 --> 09:11.926
He was a false prophet.

09:12.009 --> 09:13.737
I'd like to cut off his butt
and make him eat it

09:13.761 --> 09:16.347
and then ask him how he plans to poop it.

09:16.430 --> 09:17.932
But the Founder...

09:18.015 --> 09:20.226
Nope, he's the same.

09:20.309 --> 09:22.603
Gretchen, if you need to believe
in something,

09:22.687 --> 09:24.021
believe in yourself.

09:24.105 --> 09:26.232
Believe that no one else
can tell you what to do,

09:26.315 --> 09:29.277
because we're strong, independent women.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.171
<i>We're strong,
independent women.</i>

09:31.195 --> 09:32.530
And I'll prove it to you.

09:32.613 --> 09:34.373
We're gonna have
a <i>Choose Your Own Adventure.</i>

09:34.448 --> 09:35.950
You pick everything we do,

09:36.033 --> 09:37.201
exactly like the books.

09:37.285 --> 09:38.869
And if we die, we just go back

09:38.953 --> 09:41.372
to the entrance of the Mayan temple.

09:41.455 --> 09:43.874
I'm gonna fix you, Gretchen Chalker.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.004
Come on up, Jay.

09:54.677 --> 09:56.762
This is a total sausage fest.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.139
Please don't say that.

09:58.222 --> 09:59.222
I never eat on dates,

09:59.265 --> 10:01.642
and now I'm thinking about sausage
and Total cereal.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.269
Sorry.

10:03.352 --> 10:05.021
I've been reading up on the lifestyle,

10:05.104 --> 10:06.355
all the gay types...

10:06.439 --> 10:09.233
bears, cubs, wolves, chicken hawks.

10:09.317 --> 10:12.111
I'm a flamingo
because I'm delicate, colorful,

10:12.194 --> 10:15.197
and I often stand on one leg
due to a plantar's wart.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.199
Well, I think I might be a otter,

10:17.283 --> 10:19.702
which got me pretty interested
in otters as a species.

10:19.785 --> 10:22.121
Did you know they use rocks as tools?

10:24.373 --> 10:26.042
This line is unacceptable.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.311
We need to flirt with the bouncer.

10:27.335 --> 10:28.895
Oh, yeah, I can do that.
I'm in construction.

10:28.919 --> 10:30.463
Hey, princess!

10:30.546 --> 10:33.215
Are you a high chair?
'Cause I want to put a baby in you!

10:36.052 --> 10:37.803
Excuse me.

10:37.887 --> 10:38.929
Excuse me.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.265
Excuse me.

10:41.349 --> 10:44.435
Bounceria, you let me in last time.

10:44.518 --> 10:46.437
Because you were
with that pretty little twink.

10:46.520 --> 10:49.231
And tonight, I'm with Michael.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.108
If you let us in, he'll fix the trapeze,

10:51.192 --> 10:53.319
and we all want the trapeze back.

10:54.695 --> 10:56.197
Make him dance.

11:00.576 --> 11:02.244
<i>♪ Hearts on fire ♪</i>

11:02.328 --> 11:04.205
<i>♪ Don't put this fire out ♪</i>

11:04.288 --> 11:07.458
<i>♪ We want this fire to continue ♪</i>

11:28.354 --> 11:30.272
You're choosing your own adventure,
Gretchen.

11:30.356 --> 11:31.273
You're in charge.

11:31.357 --> 11:34.568
You bought a snorkel at a dollar store,
which...

11:34.652 --> 11:35.486
great!

11:35.569 --> 11:37.029
And now we're...

11:40.032 --> 11:42.284
Dang it! You can't swim to the boat.

11:42.368 --> 11:45.204
That's exactly what a lizard
or lotion person would say.

11:45.287 --> 11:48.249
No.
We have to do something you want to do.

11:48.332 --> 11:50.769
<i>- ♪ Put 'em on the glass ♪</i>
- Not something some man told you to do.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.521
<i>- ♪ Put 'em on the glass ♪</i>
- Yes! I heed your bidding!

11:52.545 --> 11:54.648
- No, don't put them on the glass!
<i>- ♪ Put 'em on the glass ♪</i>

11:54.672 --> 11:56.691
Just say the first thing
that pops into your head, Gretchen.

11:56.715 --> 11:58.592
Don't think! What do you want?

11:58.676 --> 12:00.094
What do you want?

12:00.177 --> 12:01.345
What do you want?

12:01.429 --> 12:02.263
Ice cream!

12:02.346 --> 12:03.931
I want ice cream!

12:04.014 --> 12:06.058
All right, you got ice cream.

12:06.142 --> 12:08.310
Six cones is a lot,
and strawberry sauce on coffee

12:08.394 --> 12:10.580
doesn't make a ton of sense,
but the important thing is,

12:10.604 --> 12:11.772
you made a decision.

12:11.856 --> 12:12.856
Now what?

12:17.736 --> 12:19.113
Okay. Wow, see?

12:19.196 --> 12:20.823
Did the Founder tell you to get a dog

12:20.906 --> 12:22.783
that once lived in a drug dealer's house?

12:22.867 --> 12:23.701
No, he didn't.

12:23.784 --> 12:25.870
That's your decision, and I support you.

12:30.666 --> 12:31.792
Gretchen, what are you...

12:35.796 --> 12:37.673
Ha-ha, lost 'em.

12:37.756 --> 12:39.925
Again, your decision.

12:40.009 --> 12:40.843
All you.

12:40.926 --> 12:42.928
Hey, what's nose candy?

12:43.012 --> 12:45.514
Oh, that sounds harmless.

12:45.598 --> 12:46.765
Let's ask around.

12:47.766 --> 12:50.769
Did I just watch you do drugs
with a junkyard Elmo?

12:50.853 --> 12:52.289
I don't know, but I got a ton of ideas.

12:52.313 --> 12:53.790
Let's go to Red Hook with these morpets

12:53.814 --> 12:55.858
and get pregnant.

12:55.941 --> 12:57.735
That's it. I'm re-kidnapping you!

12:57.818 --> 13:00.112
As if. I'm pretty sure
I'm awesome at fighting now.

13:00.196 --> 13:02.031
Punch, punch, kick, punch, punch, punch.

13:02.114 --> 13:03.199
Oh, no!

13:03.282 --> 13:05.201
Come on! Are you kidding?

13:05.284 --> 13:06.535
It's midnight,

13:06.619 --> 13:08.537
and we still haven't gotten in anywhere.

13:08.621 --> 13:11.349
I thought the hard part of being gay
was gonna be figuring out scarves.

13:11.373 --> 13:13.918
Should we make like Queen Elizabeth
and dub this a night?

13:14.001 --> 13:16.045
Hang on, Titus. I got to eat.

13:17.796 --> 13:20.799
Hey, can I get fries
and a chicken shawarma pita?

13:20.883 --> 13:21.759
You want anything?

13:21.842 --> 13:23.278
I will not be tricked into eating
on a date.

13:23.302 --> 13:24.637
This is not my first rodeo.

13:24.720 --> 13:28.390
Hey, hey, this is not meat from rodeo.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.242
Hey, sorry I cramped your style tonight.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.812
This whole scene is maybe too much for me.

13:33.896 --> 13:35.856
There are other kinds of being gay,
though, right?

13:35.898 --> 13:38.526
I mean, I always pictured, like,
wearing sweaters a lot

13:38.609 --> 13:42.571
and cooking together
and having a big, shaggy dog,

13:42.655 --> 13:45.032
and the whole place
is just covered in fur.

13:45.115 --> 13:50.162
It's all just fur and sweaters and hair
and fur and hair.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.247
That sounds boring.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.624
Compared to your life, sure,
but I'm not fancy like that.

13:53.707 --> 13:55.167
I just...

13:55.918 --> 13:57.920
Hey, did you ever see <i>The Lion King?</i>

13:58.003 --> 14:00.548
I moved to New York City
because of <i>The Lion King.</i>

14:00.631 --> 14:02.591
Dude, that is my favorite movie,

14:02.675 --> 14:05.594
play, T-shirt, and sleeping bag ever.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.137
I mean, Timon and Pumbaa?

14:07.221 --> 14:09.390
When I first saw those guys, I was like,

14:09.473 --> 14:11.433
"I'm seeing something special here."

14:11.517 --> 14:13.018
Those two little furry dudes

14:13.102 --> 14:14.270
caring for one another,

14:14.353 --> 14:18.065
singing songs, farting without judgment.

14:18.148 --> 14:20.335
They didn't fit in with all the other
meerkats and warthogs,

14:20.359 --> 14:22.403
but they fit in with each other.

14:22.486 --> 14:24.864
And they adopted that Simba from Africa.

14:24.947 --> 14:26.490
Forget bears and otters.

14:26.574 --> 14:29.618
We should all be meerkats and warthogs.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.537
And you, my friend?

14:31.620 --> 14:32.955
Classic meerkat.

14:33.038 --> 14:35.332
I am sleek and graceful.

14:35.416 --> 14:37.084
And I once went to a Halloween party

14:37.167 --> 14:38.502
dressed as Nathan Lane Bryant.

14:38.586 --> 14:40.337
It was moderately well received.

14:40.421 --> 14:41.964
Dude, try this.

14:42.047 --> 14:43.716
You like spicy?

14:49.013 --> 14:50.598
Don't sneeze. Don't...

15:01.400 --> 15:02.985
I'm so sorry.

15:12.244 --> 15:13.913
Morning, honkey.

15:13.996 --> 15:15.956
Hey, is Titus up yet?

15:16.040 --> 15:18.792
I was supposed to help him
kick Mikey out hours ago,

15:18.876 --> 15:21.420
but I gave 'em a little extra time,

15:21.503 --> 15:24.423
and I sprinkled rose petals on the bed.

15:24.506 --> 15:27.301
Actually, it's barbecue potato chips.

15:27.384 --> 15:30.679
I just had a feeling
those two would click,

15:30.763 --> 15:32.348
you know, like all my joints.

15:33.349 --> 15:34.642
Ah.

15:37.019 --> 15:38.520
Lillian, do people change,

15:38.604 --> 15:40.272
or are we just who we are forever?

15:40.356 --> 15:41.357
Whoa.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.900
That is exactly

15:42.983 --> 15:45.653
what I've been thinking about with Titus.

15:45.736 --> 15:47.905
I am telling you, Red.

15:47.988 --> 15:50.115
You and me, same brain.

15:50.199 --> 15:52.576
Hey, on the count of three,

15:52.660 --> 15:55.162
let's both say what we're thinking.

15:55.245 --> 15:58.040
One, two, three.

15:58.123 --> 15:59.708
- Whitefish!
- Four!

16:13.430 --> 16:15.391
Hey, where's Mikey?

16:17.226 --> 16:19.687
Did he die at the club?

16:19.770 --> 16:22.356
When is de Blasio gonna put an end

16:22.439 --> 16:26.819
to these senseless shorty fires
burning on the dance floor?

16:26.902 --> 16:28.612
No.

16:28.696 --> 16:30.280
I decided not to sleep with him.

16:30.364 --> 16:32.574
It's all very confusing,

16:32.658 --> 16:34.368
like that show <i>Bunny and Kitty.</i>

16:34.451 --> 16:36.412
One's a cop, the other's FBI.

16:36.495 --> 16:38.288
How are they friends?

16:38.372 --> 16:42.501
I heard your door open
at 2:00 in the morning.

16:42.584 --> 16:43.836
You did something.

16:43.919 --> 16:44.837
Barely.

16:44.920 --> 16:47.464
We just talked about movies and got food.

16:47.548 --> 16:49.800
You ate in front of him?

16:49.883 --> 16:51.927
I feezed on him, Lillian.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.220
That's a food sneeze.

16:53.303 --> 16:56.473
But he laughed, and it was a nice laugh,

16:56.557 --> 16:58.475
not like that time Andy Cohen
laughed at me.

16:58.559 --> 17:01.729
I knew this one was different.

17:01.812 --> 17:06.358
He's not like those guys
in your stupid box.

17:06.442 --> 17:08.402
No, he's exactly like those guys,

17:08.484 --> 17:10.779
because I've decided
never to see him again.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.823
And he didn't even spend the night.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.661
At least these men had the honor
of having their hearts broken

17:17.744 --> 17:20.372
by Flidian Garoo, a fake name I use.

17:20.455 --> 17:21.623
Liar!

17:21.707 --> 17:24.542
I've watched the parade of men
in and out of your door

17:24.626 --> 17:26.211
for ten years.

17:26.295 --> 17:28.565
Well, you should thank me.
Most people pay good money for parades.

17:28.589 --> 17:31.550
And the boys who left this crap behind

17:31.633 --> 17:32.968
weren't heartbroken.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.636
They didn't come back for their stuff

17:34.720 --> 17:36.597
'cause they couldn't care less.

17:36.764 --> 17:38.599
And you pick up these silly boys

17:38.682 --> 17:40.517
because you don't want 'em to come back.

17:40.601 --> 17:43.771
You think you know everything
'cause you got bit by a roach

17:43.854 --> 17:45.272
that crawled out of a dictionary.

17:45.355 --> 17:46.648
Well, guess what.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.692
I wanted them all to come back.

17:48.776 --> 17:49.693
All of them!

17:49.777 --> 17:51.779
They just never did, and they left behind

17:51.862 --> 17:53.989
some really important stuff.

17:55.699 --> 17:57.367
A Dutch passport.

17:58.285 --> 17:59.285
Insulin.

17:59.995 --> 18:00.995
This.

18:08.504 --> 18:10.523
But if it's only one night,
at least I can tell myself

18:10.547 --> 18:12.466
they didn't really know me.

18:12.549 --> 18:14.389
But what if a guy does take the time
to know me

18:14.468 --> 18:15.594
and he still leaves?

18:15.677 --> 18:17.387
Why, Mikey?

18:17.471 --> 18:20.724
Why would you leave me
to raise our lion cub alone?

18:24.394 --> 18:26.688
Titus...

18:26.772 --> 18:29.483
you can't hide in there forever.

18:29.566 --> 18:30.901
I think I could.

18:30.984 --> 18:32.861
There's quite a bit of food under here.

18:34.988 --> 18:36.115
It's him.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.450
It's Mikey.

18:39.618 --> 18:40.536
Mikey who?

18:40.619 --> 18:42.329
That kid from the cereal commercial?

18:42.412 --> 18:43.872
He died of Pop Rocks.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.500
Answer the phone, Titus.

18:48.836 --> 18:50.838
Hey, Mikey.

18:50.921 --> 18:52.297
Lillian.

18:52.381 --> 18:55.300
- Oh, hey, Lillian.
- Would you like to come over for leckfast?

18:55.384 --> 18:56.844
It's breakfast and lunch combined.

18:56.927 --> 18:58.303
I hate brunch.

18:58.387 --> 18:59.555
Wha... oh!

19:00.472 --> 19:02.558
- Don't ever call me again.
- Wait, what?

19:02.641 --> 19:03.767
No, man, it's Mikey.

19:03.851 --> 19:05.435
I was with four Mikeys last night.

19:05.519 --> 19:06.353
Be more specific.

19:06.436 --> 19:07.479
Politano.

19:07.563 --> 19:08.730
<i>Lion King </i> Mikey.

19:08.814 --> 19:09.690
That's what I thought.

19:09.773 --> 19:11.108
Lose my number. Click.

19:11.191 --> 19:12.276
Dial tone.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.426
I'd say good morning, sleepyhead, but...

19:38.886 --> 19:41.138
Oh, cracker on a cracker!

19:41.221 --> 19:42.723
When did you get a tattoo?

19:42.806 --> 19:43.992
I didn't let you out of my sight!

19:44.016 --> 19:45.535
Remember when we stopped
at the bus station

19:45.559 --> 19:46.602
to use the bathroom?

19:46.685 --> 19:49.104
I thought you were in there a long time.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.273
But you had just eaten
a bunch of bodega oysters.

19:51.356 --> 19:53.192
And now it's a new day for the new me.

19:53.275 --> 19:54.443
I saw this in the paper.

19:54.526 --> 19:55.712
I thought we could give it a go.

19:55.736 --> 19:57.946
"Body Found in Wheel Well At JFK"?

19:58.113 --> 19:59.489
When in Rome.

19:59.573 --> 20:00.908
Maybe I was wrong, Gretchen,

20:00.991 --> 20:02.826
about you being the boss of you.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.244
Wow, rude.

20:04.328 --> 20:05.704
Lil' Lisa was right about you.

20:05.787 --> 20:06.872
Oh, my gosh.

20:06.955 --> 20:08.516
How'd you even survive before the bunker,

20:08.540 --> 20:10.209
with no one telling you what to do?

20:10.292 --> 20:12.794
Well, I didn't have to.

20:12.878 --> 20:14.880
Before the bunker, I had Coach Sergei.

20:14.963 --> 20:16.465
Pepsi Cola flip.

20:16.548 --> 20:17.466
Yes, Gretchen.

20:17.549 --> 20:21.136
And now Little Caesar's
"pizza pizza pizza" side aerial.

20:21.220 --> 20:24.681
Good, and rock and roll Elvis dismount!

20:24.765 --> 20:26.642
Now never have period, huh?

20:30.479 --> 20:32.689
<i>But then I hit a growth spurt.</i>

20:34.775 --> 20:35.609
Oh, God!

20:36.777 --> 20:37.777
No!

20:37.819 --> 20:38.987
Get out, woman!

20:39.071 --> 20:40.197
Go make babies!

20:41.031 --> 20:43.075
So you've never made your own choices?

20:43.158 --> 20:44.368
Ever?

20:44.451 --> 20:46.411
I know I told you
to choose your own adventure,

20:46.495 --> 20:48.288
but you can't.

20:49.748 --> 20:52.960
I need to go back to Cosmetology.

20:53.043 --> 20:54.920
I'll just hitchhike to Mesa, Arizona,

20:55.003 --> 20:57.256
and find the Founder
at the comedy club he manages.

20:57.339 --> 20:58.799
I might as well start giving away

20:58.882 --> 21:00.342
my earthly possessions now.

21:01.885 --> 21:03.971
I'm sorry, Gretchen.

21:04.054 --> 21:04.930
No.

21:05.013 --> 21:07.516
There are those of us who lead
and those who follow.

21:07.599 --> 21:10.185
The sheeps must follow the sheep captain,

21:10.269 --> 21:12.312
and the sheep captain
must protect the sheeps

21:12.396 --> 21:14.123
and keep them from using
their dumb sheep brain

21:14.147 --> 21:15.691
and also sell their hair.

21:15.774 --> 21:17.359
Go on.

21:17.442 --> 21:19.152
There are many animals in the barnyard,

21:19.236 --> 21:21.655
but only the sheeps know
that they know nothing.

21:21.738 --> 21:23.323
Thus, they are called sheeps.

21:27.244 --> 21:28.453
Mike!

21:28.537 --> 21:32.708
Listen, we need to talk about Titus.

21:32.791 --> 21:34.334
I mean, I know he hurt you.

21:34.418 --> 21:35.252
What?

21:35.335 --> 21:36.753
Men can't hurt me.

21:36.837 --> 21:38.046
Only chicks can.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.631
Cheryl Tiegs, yo.

21:39.715 --> 21:41.717
I misspoke.

21:41.800 --> 21:44.219
I know I hurt you.

21:44.303 --> 21:47.806
I didn't mean what I said to you
on the phone.

21:47.889 --> 21:50.267
Look, Lillian,

21:50.350 --> 21:55.397
last night, I felt like me and you

21:55.480 --> 21:58.108
had this, like, chemical attraction.

21:58.191 --> 21:59.191
There you go.

22:02.154 --> 22:05.949
But Titus is my first time going off-road,

22:06.033 --> 22:07.367
if you know what I mean.

22:07.451 --> 22:10.078
I think he might be a little complicated
for me right now.

22:10.162 --> 22:14.458
I know, right now, he's cocoon goo,

22:14.541 --> 22:18.795
but someone like you
could make him a butterfly.

22:18.879 --> 22:22.007
I'm sorry, Lillian, but...

22:22.090 --> 22:23.925
I got my own stuff to deal with.

22:27.262 --> 22:28.472
Bye, Mikey.

22:30.390 --> 22:33.935
Let me just get one last taste
of that hot ass.

22:44.321 --> 22:46.241
<i>Anyway, it turned out
Kimmy was wrong.</i>

22:46.323 --> 22:48.450
I can't make my own decisions,

22:48.533 --> 22:50.253
so I'm going to Arizona
to meet the Founder.

22:50.327 --> 22:51.411
And to you gentlemen,

22:51.495 --> 22:52.996
I give my final earthly possession.

22:53.080 --> 22:54.956
Gretchen, wait!

22:55.040 --> 22:56.333
Don't give them your shirt.

22:56.416 --> 22:58.668
Oh, man.

22:58.752 --> 23:00.504
You're not going back to Cosmetology.

23:00.587 --> 23:02.297
But I can't live in the real world.

23:02.380 --> 23:04.299
I know, but I found a different cult,

23:04.382 --> 23:05.634
one that's perfect for you.

23:05.717 --> 23:07.135
Just listen to their leader talk...

23:07.219 --> 23:08.488
Shut up and let me hear the leader.

23:08.512 --> 23:09.906
<i>The sheeps must follow.</i>

23:09.930 --> 23:11.181
Is that the sheep captain?

23:11.264 --> 23:13.141
<i>Only the sheeps know they know nothing.</i>

23:13.225 --> 23:14.225
<i>Dumb sheeps.</i>

23:14.309 --> 23:16.812
<i>- Dumb.</i>
- I'm so dumb, O Captain.

23:16.895 --> 23:19.022
Two plus two is nine. The Earth is round.

23:19.106 --> 23:20.023
He's a genius.

23:20.107 --> 23:22.109
"He," Gretchen? That was you.

23:23.276 --> 23:24.569
I recorded you earlier.

23:24.653 --> 23:26.822
Then I apped and made your voice Frasier.

23:26.905 --> 23:28.490
Then I used this little bad boy

23:28.573 --> 23:29.893
and his record button to edit it.

23:30.951 --> 23:33.161
Look, I get that you need a cult,

23:33.245 --> 23:35.205
but why can't it be your cult?

23:35.288 --> 23:37.499
You want me to start my own church?
No, I can't do that.

23:37.582 --> 23:38.416
Are you kidding?

23:38.500 --> 23:40.752
When you believe in something,
no matter how dumb,

23:40.836 --> 23:42.337
I've seen you do the impossible.

23:42.420 --> 23:45.882
As we all know, Lil' Lisa died last night

23:45.966 --> 23:48.301
from, I'm told, an exploded booby.

23:48.385 --> 23:51.972
But through her faith,
she was taken up to girl heaven,

23:52.055 --> 23:53.849
which is pink and stupid.

23:53.932 --> 23:56.685
Our faith will save us, sisters.

23:56.768 --> 24:00.063
If we believe, there is nothing
we cannot do.

24:02.691 --> 24:03.942
Holy sugar!

24:04.025 --> 24:05.986
Get your hand off, you idiot!

24:06.778 --> 24:07.696
Ay!

24:07.779 --> 24:09.281
She's crazy!

24:09.364 --> 24:12.325
Spanish-Spanish-Spanish!
Right?!

24:12.409 --> 24:14.035
Praise Jeepers!

24:14.119 --> 24:16.329
I tried to make you the person
I wanted you to be,

24:16.413 --> 24:17.330
but that's not you.

24:17.414 --> 24:18.498
And that's okay.

24:18.582 --> 24:21.209
The real you is full of crazy nonsense.

24:21.293 --> 24:22.919
Mount Rushmore just grew like that.

24:23.003 --> 24:24.337
Yes, exactly.

24:24.421 --> 24:26.214
We're different people.

24:26.298 --> 24:28.675
You can't move on from the bunker
like I ha...

24:30.302 --> 24:31.302
Ugh.

24:32.762 --> 24:34.973
So you're gonna move on in your own way

24:35.056 --> 24:37.058
by starting a cult.

24:40.187 --> 24:41.938
You're gonna go to hell so bad.

24:42.022 --> 24:43.857
I know, Gretchen.

24:43.940 --> 24:44.941
I know.

24:53.241 --> 24:54.951
Titus, take that off.

24:55.035 --> 24:56.453
No.

24:56.536 --> 24:59.289
'Cause I know this blanket
would never hurt me.

25:03.960 --> 25:04.960
Ow!

25:05.003 --> 25:06.129
I hate you, blanket.

25:07.923 --> 25:09.049
Anybody home?

25:10.008 --> 25:10.842
Is that Mikey?

25:10.926 --> 25:12.344
Hello?

25:12.427 --> 25:13.261
What is he doing here?

25:13.345 --> 25:15.180
He can't see me looking unfabulous.

25:15.263 --> 25:16.264
Why do you care?

25:16.348 --> 25:17.182
You said he's boring.

25:17.265 --> 25:18.642
I don't care, obviously.

25:18.725 --> 25:19.893
I care.

25:19.976 --> 25:20.894
Shut up.

25:20.977 --> 25:22.371
Just help me make my life look legendary.

25:22.395 --> 25:23.730
Since when do you question me?

25:24.689 --> 25:25.732
Hello?

25:29.444 --> 25:30.487
Oh.

25:30.570 --> 25:32.072
You are bad.

25:32.155 --> 25:34.908
Oh, hello, Michael.

25:34.991 --> 25:36.552
I'm actually in the middle of something.

25:36.576 --> 25:38.286
Get in here, Titus!

25:38.370 --> 25:40.372
My butt's getting cold!

25:40.455 --> 25:41.623
Oh.

25:41.706 --> 25:44.501
Well, I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I think I left my Multi-Tool here

25:44.584 --> 25:46.127
when I fixed your oven-dryer.

25:46.211 --> 25:48.213
I just want to get it back.

25:48.296 --> 25:50.215
I've got a mustache!

25:50.298 --> 25:53.051
I'll just grab it
and get out of your hair.

25:58.932 --> 26:00.475
You came back.

26:01.393 --> 26:02.435
No one comes back.

26:02.519 --> 26:05.355
Yeah, well, maybe you've been dating
bad guys, Titus.

26:05.438 --> 26:06.982
I'm actually a good guy.

26:07.065 --> 26:09.651
- So you'd never hurt me?
- What?

26:09.734 --> 26:11.444
I can't say that.

26:11.528 --> 26:13.029
You know I'm all about <i>hakuna matata,</i>

26:13.113 --> 26:16.700
but all I can promise
is that it'd be different from...

26:16.783 --> 26:17.783
whatever that is.

26:17.826 --> 26:19.786
We met on a bus!

26:19.869 --> 26:22.414
I don't know why Kimmy is doing that.

26:22.497 --> 26:24.124
Let's make a baby!

26:24.207 --> 26:26.876
But you're saying if I gave you
a second chance...

26:26.960 --> 26:28.503
If you gave me a second chance?

26:28.586 --> 26:30.839
Man, you are ridiculous.

26:30.922 --> 26:32.173
Thank you.

26:32.257 --> 26:35.468
Titus, I'm the one
who'd have to <i>Property Brothers</i>

26:35.552 --> 26:36.636
this gut job.

26:36.720 --> 26:39.264
You need foundation work, rewiring.

26:39.347 --> 26:40.557
I bet you have termites.

26:40.640 --> 26:43.518
And I can't take on a project like that

26:43.601 --> 26:45.186
unless you're willing to...

26:51.026 --> 26:52.110
Wow.

26:53.028 --> 26:54.237
I mean, I kissed boys before,

26:54.321 --> 26:57.240
you know, at football camp,
Boy Scouts, at Equinox,

26:57.324 --> 26:59.117
but that stuff wasn't really gay.

27:00.035 --> 27:01.828
Wait a minute. That was all gay.

27:05.999 --> 27:07.709
Aww.

27:07.792 --> 27:08.960
It's two boys.

27:09.961 --> 27:12.130
I'm just glad you left
your little foldy knife here.

27:12.213 --> 27:14.549
Yeah, it's weird, 'cause I swear
I used it this morning.

27:14.632 --> 27:16.718
Who cares how it got here?

27:16.801 --> 27:17.969
It's here!

27:18.053 --> 27:19.721
You kissed!

27:19.804 --> 27:23.725
Now go buy a pair of French bulldogs
already!

27:37.864 --> 27:40.367
Sheeps, board the airplane.
