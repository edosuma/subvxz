13:40.200 --> 13:42.840
I can play the lost soul
seeking redemption.

13:42.960 --> 13:45.000
But the others are asking
a lot of questions.

13:45.120 --> 13:46.720
I should still have
a day or so.

13:46.840 --> 13:50.000
I know, but everyone's worried,
especially Rob and Kylie.

13:50.120 --> 13:52.600
I'm not sure how long
I can keep fobbing them off.

13:52.720 --> 13:54.520
I'm sure you're
doing fine, Charlie.

13:54.640 --> 13:57.400
All the same, I'm getting
nothing but dead ends
back at work.

13:57.520 --> 13:59.480
Please give me some
good news soon.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.040
I'll do my best.

14:01.160 --> 14:04.720
Hey, I'm going to a church.
Maybe there'll be a miracle.

14:15.920 --> 14:19.800
Let the wicked forsake his way,

14:19.920 --> 14:23.480
and the unrighteous
man his thoughts,

14:23.600 --> 14:26.840
and let him return
unto the Lord.

14:26.960 --> 14:29.400
And He will have mercy upon him,

14:29.520 --> 14:31.600
and to our God,

14:31.720 --> 14:35.120
for He will abundantly pardon.

14:35.240 --> 14:38.120
Thank you all for coming.

14:38.240 --> 14:40.000
Now, we have to set up
for the next service,

14:40.120 --> 14:43.720
so if I could ask you all
to leave as quickly and
as quietly as possible.

14:43.840 --> 14:45.680
Thanks very much.

14:58.280 --> 14:59.480
Thanks for coming.

14:59.600 --> 15:02.920
DI Clacy, Vice Unit.
Can we have a word in private?

15:11.280 --> 15:12.600
You took your time.

15:13.320 --> 15:14.880
Had to be extra careful.

15:16.920 --> 15:19.920
Just came to tell you, this is
the last time we meet, yeah?

15:20.720 --> 15:22.720
What?

15:22.840 --> 15:26.040
I am not ending up
as a dead body with a sign
stapled to my chest.

15:26.160 --> 15:28.200
-You heard about that?
-Heard...

15:29.640 --> 15:30.880
Heard about it?

15:31.000 --> 15:32.520
I've seen the bloody pictures!

15:33.160 --> 15:35.640
I'm done, I'm out.

15:36.280 --> 15:37.960
Have a nice life.

15:38.080 --> 15:40.440
Wait. Danny, wait!

15:42.360 --> 15:43.480
Shit.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.360
-Dare you to nick his pen.
-Eh?

15:58.480 --> 16:00.080
Nick his pen. See if he notices.

16:00.200 --> 16:02.960
Let's see how observant these
Witness Protection people are.

16:03.080 --> 16:05.080
I'm not nicking his pen.

16:05.200 --> 16:06.280
Cool.

16:09.040 --> 16:10.200
Fuck it.

16:14.120 --> 16:18.000
-Yep?
-'Mr Sullivan, it's DS Phillips.

16:18.120 --> 16:20.480
'I'm calling about
Julian Nelson's death.'

16:20.600 --> 16:22.240
I thought I'd told you
everything I knew.

16:22.360 --> 16:26.480
I'm putting the details
together. A statement
would be helpful.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.560
We're a bit snowed under here
at the moment...

16:28.680 --> 16:33.040
Today or tomorrow's fine.
Just a short statement
so we can stop bothering you.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.280
OK.

16:35.400 --> 16:37.120
Let me finish up some work
and I'll call you back.

16:37.240 --> 16:39.440
That'd be great, many thanks.

16:41.840 --> 16:42.960
Fuck.

16:44.840 --> 16:46.120
So how does this work?

16:46.240 --> 16:47.840
Just introduce us.

16:47.960 --> 16:49.400
What, like...

16:49.520 --> 16:51.760
You have introduced people
before, haven't you?

16:51.880 --> 16:53.320
-Yes.
-There you go.

17:00.360 --> 17:05.320
Luke, this is my cousin, Sally.
Sally, Luke.

17:05.440 --> 17:07.960
-Hi.
-Hiya.

17:08.080 --> 17:12.680
Sally's come to help out,
so if you could, you know,
show her the ropes?

17:13.360 --> 17:14.600
Yeah, yeah, sure.

17:14.720 --> 17:17.080
Right. OK, well,

17:17.200 --> 17:19.840
I've got to see to everything.

17:23.840 --> 17:26.400
Now we arrange the tables
and chairs for dinner.

17:26.520 --> 17:29.400
Every day, 7pm, anyone who
needs it can eat for free.

17:29.520 --> 17:31.880
Why don't you just leave them
arranged, then?

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
Because at night time,
we let people camp out in here.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.640
That's great.

17:36.760 --> 17:40.160
We do our best.
It's not much, but it helps.

17:40.280 --> 17:42.920
So how long have you been
doing this for then?

17:43.040 --> 17:44.960
Do you always ask
so many questions?

17:46.080 --> 17:48.560
Sorry. Just making conversation.

17:50.200 --> 17:52.520
I've been here since the attack.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.800
You found God, too, then?

17:55.800 --> 17:57.680
Do you believe in God?

17:59.560 --> 18:01.560
I believe there's something.

18:01.680 --> 18:03.600
Something bigger than us.

18:03.720 --> 18:05.200
There has to be, right?

18:08.040 --> 18:13.280
I used to believe that,
and then I realised
there's nothing. Just us.

18:13.400 --> 18:17.000
We can choose to make the world
better or worse, and that's it.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.680
You sound like you're trying to
make up for something.

18:21.800 --> 18:24.920
We all pretend our actions
don't have consequences.

18:25.040 --> 18:28.080
Well, mine did,
and people got hurt.

18:28.200 --> 18:30.160
I'll get the chairs,
four to a table.

18:30.280 --> 18:34.760
In my old job,
I saw something happen.

18:36.600 --> 18:39.560
I saw a friend
do something awful.

18:39.680 --> 18:41.240
But he convinced me
not to report it,

18:41.360 --> 18:43.120
so I kept quiet.

18:43.240 --> 18:45.320
I'm still trying to make up
for that now.

18:47.000 --> 18:51.080
Believe me, whatever you did,
it can't be as bad
as what I did.

18:55.640 --> 18:57.840
-CHARLIE: What's the news?
-No leak at Witness Protection.

18:57.960 --> 19:00.240
-How sure are you?
-They showed us their systems,

19:00.360 --> 19:04.000
failsafes, and their, get this,
weekly security checks
on all staff.

19:04.120 --> 19:08.000
We've double-checked everything
they gave us on our systems.
No way there's a leak.

19:08.120 --> 19:09.760
He laughed at us for asking.

19:09.880 --> 19:13.240
The others are getting scared.
News of the murders
is getting round.

19:13.360 --> 19:14.880
How are they doing it?

19:15.000 --> 19:18.760
Maybe we're missing the obvious.
How would you normally
find someone?

19:18.880 --> 19:21.160
VIK: Enlighten us.
JEZ: The Missing Persons Scheme.

19:21.280 --> 19:23.040
How do you mean?

19:23.160 --> 19:27.920
Not sure, but there's a lot
of missing people.
Maybe they found a loophole.

19:28.040 --> 19:32.680
Before the attack on London,
there were 210,000 people
reported missing each year.

19:32.800 --> 19:34.560
Since then it's quadrupled.

19:34.680 --> 19:37.480
-Jesus.
-Which is why we've got
a bit of a backlog.

19:37.600 --> 19:40.640
Suppose I wanted to find
someone, what's the process?

19:40.760 --> 19:44.280
Fill out the forms,
give us the information,
join the queue.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.680
If someone changed their name,
could you find them?

19:46.800 --> 19:49.280
If you have any of their
biometric data, yeah.

19:49.400 --> 19:52.560
So if I gave you, say,
the dental records of someone

19:52.680 --> 19:55.920
-with a new identity, it'd give
me their new name and address?
-Yes.

19:56.040 --> 19:59.480
JEZ: Have any searches been done
on these two, Kocak and Janaw?

20:06.320 --> 20:10.200
No. Never. Apart from this one
I did just now,
and that will be logged.

20:10.320 --> 20:13.840
Any search logs the ID card
of the operator and the
person who requested it.

20:13.960 --> 20:16.800
But one of these lot,
could they get around that?

20:16.920 --> 20:18.760
In theory. Nothing's impossible.

20:18.880 --> 20:21.720
But we do conduct strict
background checks on
all our employees.

20:21.840 --> 20:23.680
-VIK: Before you employ them?
-Yeah.

20:23.800 --> 20:26.160
What about afterwards?
Do you keep checking them?

20:26.960 --> 20:29.160
No. Why?

20:29.280 --> 20:31.720
So if someone had the biometric
details of all the witnesses,

20:31.840 --> 20:33.200
they could do a search that way?

20:33.320 --> 20:35.200
-And would it find them?
-Straight away.

20:35.320 --> 20:37.000
So why hasn't it
shown up in the logs?

20:37.120 --> 20:38.600
Maybe someone's hacked
into the system,

20:38.720 --> 20:40.440
and is making changes
undetected.

20:40.560 --> 20:42.080
The security isn't up to much.

20:42.200 --> 20:44.880
Twelve burglaries
at dentists' offices,
all in the past month.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.720
All the patient records
were stolen,

20:46.840 --> 20:50.320
and our friends Janaw and Kocak
were both treated
at the places that got hit.

20:50.440 --> 20:55.200
OK, great. Let's cross-reference
the stolen records with
Witness Protection's files.

20:55.320 --> 20:57.680
And let's go back to
the Missing Persons Scheme,

20:57.800 --> 20:59.960
check their employee list,
see if anything sticks out.

21:00.080 --> 21:01.720
Well done, by the way.

It's not something I can

Well, I don't know what
you think he's done,

21:48.320 --> 21:51.040
but I know in my heart
he's not a bad person.

21:52.720 --> 21:57.000
You know, we get new members

21:57.600 --> 21:59.720
Desperate people,

21:59.840 --> 22:03.920
with stories so awful,
it hurts to hear them.

22:04.040 --> 22:07.200
Luke listens to
every one of them.

22:07.320 --> 22:10.040
Treats them like
they're his own family.

Lots of people who've got family
who can't get into the country.

23:55.160 --> 23:57.360
They'd probably pay a lot of
money to get them here.

23:57.480 --> 23:59.320
That's what he does.
All this is just a front.

You should be very careful
about threatening me.

Really?

24:15.360 --> 24:17.000
I could have you detained.

And you don't remember
seeing Mr Nelson after
the morning of July 27th?

26:41.640 --> 26:45.280
No. He was on different
rotation that day.

26:45.400 --> 26:48.360
Do you remember where you were
between 12:30 and 1:00?

26:48.480 --> 26:51.040
I think everyone remembers
where they were on that day.

26:51.160 --> 26:53.640
But specifically,
between 12.30 and 1:00,

26:53.760 --> 26:57.360
I think I was in
the teaching hospital,
practising removing appendices.

26:57.480 --> 27:00.560
It was shortly after that
all hell broke loose in London.

27:00.680 --> 27:03.520
The rest of the day
is a bit more blurred.

27:04.480 --> 27:06.280
OK, thank you.

27:06.400 --> 27:09.800
I'll get one of the officers
to help you with your statement.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.680
Sure.

27:49.920 --> 27:51.880
What's happening?

27:52.000 --> 27:53.440
-Hey, man.
-Cool?

27:53.560 --> 27:55.920
Yeah. Yeah.

27:57.640 --> 27:58.680
Want a coffee?

28:02.800 --> 28:06.040
Charlie! As you haven't
returned my calls,

28:06.160 --> 28:08.000
I've had to come down
to field office 19.

28:08.120 --> 28:11.200
It better not be a
waste of my time.

28:11.320 --> 28:14.560
-What's the latest on the
murdered informers?
-We're making headway.

28:14.680 --> 28:16.240
Good. We need a result.

28:16.360 --> 28:18.240
How about Rachel?

28:18.360 --> 28:21.200
-If she's not out by tomorrow...
-I'm sure she'll be out by then.

28:21.320 --> 28:23.360
I've been told she's making
a quick recovery.

28:30.280 --> 28:33.040
-Any word on Rachel?
-She's doing well,
she'll be back by tomorrow.

28:33.160 --> 28:36.840
-Can we go and see her?
-We can't, you know the score.

28:37.680 --> 28:39.160
Fine.

28:39.280 --> 28:41.960
-JEZ: Got it.
-What? What is it?

28:42.080 --> 28:45.440
Peter Norris, worked for the
Missing Persons Scheme
for three years.

28:45.560 --> 28:49.040
Six months ago, he started
receiving cash deposits
into his bank account,

28:49.160 --> 28:50.960
500 quid every week.

28:51.080 --> 28:53.600
This is the guy who's selling
information to terrorists.
It's him.

28:53.720 --> 28:56.120
Good work. Excellent.
Let's pick him up.

28:56.240 --> 28:59.840
Two more sources gone.
Won't talk to me,
won't even look at me.

28:59.960 --> 29:02.320
We're going to sort it
before it gets worse.

29:04.920 --> 29:07.880
-So have you joined the queue
for the Missing Persons Scheme?
-No.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.680
Why not?

29:09.800 --> 29:11.640
'Cause right now,
they might be alive.

29:11.760 --> 29:15.800
If I do a search,
and my family turn up dead,
I'd rather not know.

29:17.160 --> 29:18.960
That way, there's still hope.

29:23.160 --> 29:25.400
Don't you think it's weird
we can't know where Rachel is?

29:25.520 --> 29:28.320
It's like Charlie said,
they can't be too careful.

29:29.800 --> 29:31.360
There's our bad guy.

29:34.080 --> 29:38.000
He's helping terrorists find
people in witness protection?

29:38.120 --> 29:40.400
Oi! Peter Norris!

29:43.920 --> 29:45.480
Are we going to chase him?

29:45.600 --> 29:48.040
Yeah, in a minute.

29:59.560 --> 30:01.280

30:46.960 --> 30:48.800
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

30:48.920 --> 30:51.920
I didn't kill anyone!
I just find people,
that's all I do!

30:52.040 --> 30:55.280
I work at the Missing Persons
Scheme, I can get around
the security logs!

30:55.400 --> 30:56.560
KYLIE: Off-the-record searches?

30:56.680 --> 30:58.560
That's it. I get the names,
I fiddle the system,

30:58.680 --> 31:00.360
<i>I pass on the details,
and I get my money!</i>

31:00.480 --> 31:04.480
Come on, Pete,
you expect us to believe you're
not a brilliant super spy?

31:04.600 --> 31:06.400
We know you killed
those men, Pete.

31:06.520 --> 31:09.800
Who's funding you?
CIA? Al-Qaeda?

31:09.920 --> 31:12.960
What? No! I'm a loser!

31:13.080 --> 31:17.040
Please, you've got
to believe me,
I'm a great, big, fat nobody!

31:17.160 --> 31:19.120
Who gives you the
records to search?

31:19.240 --> 31:22.160
A guy, I don't know him,
we just do emails.

31:22.280 --> 31:24.120
He pays me,
and I get him what he needs.

31:24.240 --> 31:26.800
-And you've never met him?
-No, never.

31:26.920 --> 31:29.800
Right, well, you're going to
send him an email and
set up a meeting.

31:29.920 --> 31:31.520
Saying what?

31:31.640 --> 31:33.720
I'm going to write it for you.

31:35.360 --> 31:36.880
We'll be able to hear
everything you say.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.560
Just talk normally,
the mic's very sensitive.
Go on.

31:41.880 --> 31:43.760
Hello? Hello.

31:44.440 --> 31:46.200
My name is Peter Norris.

31:47.000 --> 31:50.120
I'm very scared and cold.

31:50.720 --> 31:52.760
Crystal clear.

31:52.880 --> 31:56.080
You'll need this,
so we can talk to you.

31:56.920 --> 31:59.800
And, if it all goes tits up,

31:59.920 --> 32:03.160
we'll detonate this,
and explode your heart.

32:04.440 --> 32:06.200
I won't let you guys down.

32:06.320 --> 32:09.120
Rachel, listen to me,
you have to finish this
by the end of today.

32:09.240 --> 32:11.280
People are asking
too many questions.

32:11.400 --> 32:12.800
<i>I don't want to put you
in any more danger.</i>

32:12.920 --> 32:14.600
OK. OK. I'll do what I can.

32:14.720 --> 32:16.240
<i>Yates wants you back
in the field office.</i>

32:16.360 --> 32:18.920
<i>I can't keep this hidden
from MI5 much longer.</i>

32:21.920 --> 32:25.920
Hey, Luke.
Have you got time for a chat?

32:30.160 --> 32:33.440
Just starting to wonder
what I'm doing here, really.

32:33.560 --> 32:36.080
You know,
there's no shame in giving up,

32:36.200 --> 32:38.000
going back to your family.

32:38.120 --> 32:39.360
And prove you right?

32:39.480 --> 32:40.960
No way.

32:45.840 --> 32:49.120
What about you? Are you going
back to your family?

32:50.160 --> 32:52.960
No. I can't face them yet.

32:53.080 --> 32:55.440
I've got to make up
for what happened.

32:55.560 --> 32:58.200
So it's not God's forgiveness
you're looking for, then?

32:59.720 --> 33:03.400
I've told you.
I'm not convinced
there is a God.

33:03.520 --> 33:06.600
If it's that bad,
can't you go to the police?
Tell someone about it.

33:06.720 --> 33:10.480
No. I don't know who's involved.
They could make me disappear.

33:10.600 --> 33:12.560
Don't say it doesn't happen,
'cause we both know it does.

33:12.680 --> 33:14.440
They're not all like that.
Some are good people.

33:14.560 --> 33:15.760
If you could talk to one
of them...

33:15.880 --> 33:18.000
There's no way, all right?

33:18.120 --> 33:19.640
How would I know
who I could trust?

33:23.720 --> 33:25.720
-Sit down.
-Why?

33:28.760 --> 33:30.320
You trust me?

33:32.080 --> 33:33.840
I think so.

33:33.960 --> 33:35.520
And you know I'm a good person?

33:37.880 --> 33:40.480
I work for MI5.

33:40.600 --> 33:43.160
-Oh, shit.
-It's OK, you can trust...

33:43.280 --> 33:44.520
You lying bitch!

33:44.640 --> 33:46.240
I need to know what you know,
it's really important.

33:46.360 --> 33:47.640
Please. I'm one of
the good guys!

33:47.760 --> 33:50.320
Is that why you lied to me? Eh?
Pretended to...

33:50.440 --> 33:52.200
[GRUNTS] God, I'm so stupid.

33:52.320 --> 33:55.040
I saw something at work.
You'd say anything.

33:55.160 --> 33:57.400
No, no, no. That was true,
I swear. I've never told
anyone about that!

33:57.520 --> 33:58.480
-Get out of my way!
-Please.

33:58.600 --> 34:00.360
Get out of my way!

PETE: I'm in position.

34:20.200 --> 34:22.760
How does this work? I don't even
know what he looks like.

34:22.880 --> 34:24.960
ROB: That's the reason we're
doing this whole thing, Pete.

34:26.720 --> 34:28.760
He'll find you,
wait for him to sit down.

34:28.880 --> 34:31.680
Ask him if he's the guy,
and we'll do the rest.

34:31.800 --> 34:34.520
'Just be normal, OK?'

34:34.640 --> 34:35.920
Yeah, normal.

35:01.520 --> 35:04.280
-Anything else?
-ROB: 'Stop looking
at us, Pete.'

35:04.400 --> 35:06.960
-Sorry.
-What for?

35:07.080 --> 35:09.800
-Pardon?
-You said you were sorry.

35:09.920 --> 35:12.000
Yeah. I...

35:14.280 --> 35:15.640
...farted.

35:16.920 --> 35:19.480
[LAUGHS] This is painful.

35:20.080 --> 35:21.640

-Yeah.

That's me.

35:36.680 --> 35:37.920
Are you the guy?

35:38.360 --> 35:39.920
The guy?

35:40.040 --> 35:42.000
You know what I mean.

35:42.120 --> 35:44.320
Yeah, I'm the guy.

35:44.440 --> 35:46.960
The guy that pays you very well
not to ask stupid questions.

35:47.080 --> 35:49.760
Now, what's all this about?
I'm busy.

35:50.600 --> 35:54.280
Well, I... I wanted to...

35:55.760 --> 35:57.400
[BREATHING HEAVILY]

35:59.080 --> 36:01.680
Sit down.

36:01.800 --> 36:05.600
ROB: Patrick Conlan,
director of Reconnected UK.

36:05.720 --> 36:09.520
We know he's been contacted
by seven different
terrorist groups.

36:09.640 --> 36:11.880
The terrorists gave Conlan
dental records

36:12.000 --> 36:14.960
to track down the informers
through the
Missing Persons Scheme.

36:15.080 --> 36:17.800
-So who's next?
-That's what Rob's trying to
squeeze out of him now.

36:17.920 --> 36:20.760
Seven different groups?
They can't all be working
together, can they?

36:20.880 --> 36:24.640
All the terrorist networks were
severely hit by the sudden rush
of informers after the bomb.

36:24.760 --> 36:26.080
There's been talk
of an alliance.

36:26.200 --> 36:28.360
It didn't make sense why they
would do that, until now.

36:28.480 --> 36:31.320
Pooling their resources,
using the same leak,
the same hitmen.

36:31.440 --> 36:34.760
Conlan finally cracked.
He gave them information
on this guy this morning.

street cameras, webcams,

anything that shows the area
around the safe house.

36:45.400 --> 36:47.240

36:51.360 --> 36:53.640
-Get in.
-No, thanks.

36:55.680 --> 36:57.480
-And?
-In a shocking turn of events,

36:57.600 --> 36:59.760
he just bought himself
a large handgun this morning.

Now, why would he need
one of those?

37:01.680 --> 37:04.800
-How do you know that?
-I've spoken to the guy
who sold it to him.

37:04.920 --> 37:07.120
I'm telling you,
he's using this church as
a front for something else.

-I don't think so.
-Come on, Rachel, grow up!

37:09.760 --> 37:12.120
He's fed you a load of religious
bullshit and you've bought it.

Where is he?

37:13.720 --> 37:16.040
-I'm pulling him in.
-And we both know
what that means.

Can't have a suspected terrorist
walking the streets with a gun.

37:18.800 --> 37:20.200

What is he, then?
God's angel of fucking mercy?

37:23.200 --> 37:25.600
Just stop it, will you?
He's not a terrorist.

37:25.720 --> 37:27.280
You can believe that
if you like.

doing, it's not the answer.

38:02.360 --> 38:05.120
I can't help anybody.

38:05.240 --> 38:08.360
Look, if this was
an official investigation,

38:08.480 --> 38:10.080
I could just pull you in.
But I can't.

38:10.200 --> 38:14.160
Then leave me alone.
I've got things to do.

38:14.280 --> 38:18.080
Killing yourself,
it won't change anything, Luke!

38:18.200 --> 38:20.000
Christ, what did you see?

38:22.480 --> 38:25.240
I know it's something to do
with the nuclear attack.

Tell me.

38:30.640 --> 38:32.360
I can help.

38:36.320 --> 38:37.840
I brought them into the country.

38:38.640 --> 38:40.960
Who?

38:41.080 --> 38:42.760
The real men
behind the bomb.

38:45.560 --> 38:47.560
The last job just felt wrong.

38:47.680 --> 38:49.600
Couldn't put my finger on it.

38:49.720 --> 38:52.160
I brought four men in,
they were together.

38:54.600 --> 38:57.240
I knew they were terrorists.

38:57.360 --> 38:59.520
I just didn't know what kind.

38:59.640 --> 39:02.520
How did you know
they were responsible
for the London attack?

39:04.840 --> 39:06.600
When they arrested the bombers,

39:06.720 --> 39:09.480
they showed the mug shots of the
guys I smuggled in on the telly.

39:09.600 --> 39:10.920
They claimed they were
the ring leaders,

39:11.040 --> 39:12.680
and that they were killed
in the explosion.

39:14.880 --> 39:17.320
I know that's a lie.

39:17.440 --> 39:20.720
'Cause I smuggled them
back out of the country
the morning of the bomb.

Kylie's position yet?

him in some way. Trick him.
