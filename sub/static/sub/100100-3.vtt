00:00.701 --> 00:02.811
Previously on "Batwoman"...

00:02.814 --> 00:04.574
Seriously, Kate. You can't be going out

00:04.576 --> 00:06.660
in Gotham every night
pretending to be Batman.

00:06.663 --> 00:09.572
Catherine Hamilton's investigators found

00:09.575 --> 00:13.045
bones, skull fragments of a little girl.

00:13.048 --> 00:14.427
It's Beth.

00:14.430 --> 00:16.293
Who the hell are you?

00:16.296 --> 00:17.963
I'm Alice.

00:17.966 --> 00:19.225
How do you do?

00:19.228 --> 00:20.277
I think Alice is Beth.

00:20.279 --> 00:22.822
I know that you want to
believe that Beth is alive.

00:22.825 --> 00:25.323
I do, too, but facts are facts.

00:25.326 --> 00:27.997
My father gave up on me,

00:28.000 --> 00:30.155
and I want to make him suffer

00:30.158 --> 00:31.508
the way that I did!

00:37.178 --> 00:40.384
_

00:59.971 --> 01:02.004
"Will you walk a little faster?"

01:02.007 --> 01:03.759
Said a whiting to a snail.

01:03.762 --> 01:05.303
"There's a porpoise close behind us,

01:05.306 --> 01:06.814
and he's treading on my tail.

01:06.816 --> 01:10.541
See how eagerly the lobsters
and the turtles all advance.

01:10.544 --> 01:12.166
They are waiting on the shingle...

01:12.169 --> 01:14.219
Will you come and join the dance?"

01:15.642 --> 01:19.110
"Will you, won't you,
will you, won't you?

01:19.112 --> 01:21.632
Will you come and join the dance?"

01:54.315 --> 01:55.347
Aah!

02:10.122 --> 02:12.080
Alice figured me out, Bruce.

02:12.083 --> 02:14.504
I put on your suit to terrify her,

02:14.507 --> 02:17.620
but it can't protect me
if she knows who I am.

02:17.623 --> 02:19.204
I lost my advantage,

02:19.206 --> 02:22.798
and in the process, I gave
Gotham their hero back.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.567
I didn't sign up for this part.

02:24.569 --> 02:27.821
I never meant to give
the city so much hope.

02:27.823 --> 02:29.433
I can't do this.

02:29.436 --> 02:31.021
I'm not you.

02:48.410 --> 02:50.668
Subtle.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.679
Hmm. I guess it's broken.

02:52.681 --> 02:54.619
It's supposed to call Batman.

02:54.622 --> 02:55.871
What do you want?

02:55.896 --> 02:58.017
What happened to your
Batsuit knockoff, Kate?

02:58.019 --> 02:59.877
Too tight, no give,

02:59.879 --> 03:02.338
or did you just realize that

03:02.340 --> 03:04.548
you accidentally blew a dog whistle

03:04.550 --> 03:06.122
that you can't unblow?

03:06.125 --> 03:09.315
I wore it to protect myself
from you and your goons.

03:09.318 --> 03:13.182
And in the process, you made
everyone horny for Batman.

03:13.184 --> 03:17.311
All these poor souls
gazing up at the Bat-light,

03:17.313 --> 03:22.459
thinking, "My life is about to change".

03:25.881 --> 03:27.196
No. Still sucks.

03:27.198 --> 03:29.201
Are you suggesting
that I put it back on?

03:29.204 --> 03:33.126
No. Being a hero is
not your strong suit.

03:33.129 --> 03:37.966
I would know, seeing as you
let Dad declare me dead.

03:37.969 --> 03:40.320
Where's my boyfriend?

03:40.323 --> 03:41.655
Hanging in there.

03:41.658 --> 03:43.753
You like damaged men.

03:43.756 --> 03:45.214
He's badly damaged.

03:45.216 --> 03:47.883
You may want to get him back soon.

03:47.885 --> 03:52.930
Okay. I'll play. How?

03:52.932 --> 03:55.826
Show me you can stop killing people.

03:55.829 --> 03:57.962
Last 24 hours,

03:57.965 --> 04:00.863
and I'll reassess.

04:00.866 --> 04:02.754
Rats!

04:02.757 --> 04:04.475
I lost my pocket watch.

04:04.477 --> 04:07.662
And I lost my sister:
Beth. Remember her?

04:07.664 --> 04:09.088
Yeah. I would like her back.

04:09.090 --> 04:14.561
Ohh! You are going to be
very annoying, aren't you?

04:14.564 --> 04:16.235
Very.

04:20.844 --> 04:22.960
Fine. No killing,

04:22.962 --> 04:26.621
but only for my darling Dodgson's sake,

04:26.624 --> 04:28.849
not for Beth.

04:28.852 --> 04:33.020
Beth has gone down, down,
down the rabbit hole,

04:33.022 --> 04:36.449
and she's never coming back.

04:36.451 --> 04:41.550
Much like Gotham's beloved... Bat.

04:43.065 --> 04:45.024
You've worked hard to
get to where you are.

04:45.026 --> 04:47.368
You deserve to feel safe.
Don't you want your kids

04:47.370 --> 04:48.986
to be able to play outside again?

04:48.988 --> 04:52.447
Elliot Estates are Gotham's
walls within the walls

04:52.450 --> 04:54.950
with on-site 24-hour Crows security

04:54.952 --> 04:56.827
and a safe room in every unit.

04:56.829 --> 04:58.220
Have you been mugged?

04:58.223 --> 04:59.860
Has your property been vandalized?

04:59.863 --> 05:02.308
At Elliot Estates, you
don't ever have to

05:02.310 --> 05:03.666
worry about that again.

05:03.669 --> 05:05.419
How do I know?

05:05.422 --> 05:06.920
I'm Tommy Elliot,

05:06.923 --> 05:09.405
and I'm here to make Gotham safe again.

05:13.804 --> 05:16.138
Nice. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

05:16.140 --> 05:19.504
Now I am that annoyingly
overprotective husband.

05:19.507 --> 05:21.190
You're married.

05:21.193 --> 05:24.514
Yeah, yeah. Nice. Nice.

05:24.517 --> 05:26.534
Are you happy?

05:26.537 --> 05:28.518
Here. Lean in.

05:31.292 --> 05:33.372
You're a little more
aggressive than usual.

05:33.375 --> 05:36.083
What's the problem? You can't take it?

05:36.085 --> 05:37.886
All right.

05:40.553 --> 05:42.358
You need to move on.

05:51.842 --> 05:53.342
Ha ha ha!

05:53.344 --> 05:56.512
You know, most couples just
have breakfast together.

05:56.514 --> 05:58.145
I've got an energy bar in my bag.

05:58.148 --> 05:59.436
Oh. Can we split it?

06:01.094 --> 06:04.732
Hmm. Well, front desk says
the commander's here.

06:04.735 --> 06:06.410
I got to go.

06:25.042 --> 06:27.226
You can watch it a million times.

06:27.228 --> 06:29.729
Alice still gets away at the end.

06:31.182 --> 06:34.255
No one's taken responsibility
for the attack.

06:34.258 --> 06:36.977
Trail's gone cold.

06:36.980 --> 06:39.906
Who'd want her dead when
she's already in custody?

06:39.908 --> 06:42.158
Besides most of Gotham?

06:43.894 --> 06:47.438
What can I do for you, Agent Moore?

06:47.440 --> 06:49.323
I think I can be helpful, sir.

06:49.325 --> 06:52.735
Considering Alice could
attack again at any time,

06:52.737 --> 06:54.253
I was hoping to get your approval

06:54.255 --> 06:56.506
for a special assignment.

06:58.167 --> 07:00.409
Okay, people. Vesper Fairchild here.

07:00.412 --> 07:02.307
So I'm staring at my wall chart.

07:02.310 --> 07:05.548
Has it really been 10 days
without a Batman sighting?

07:05.550 --> 07:07.124
Anyone else feeling ghosted?

07:07.126 --> 07:10.177
Talk to me, Gotham. Where's Batman?

07:10.179 --> 07:14.116
Just gonna pinch a little bit.

07:14.119 --> 07:15.577
3... 2...

07:15.580 --> 07:18.351
And... you're done.

07:18.354 --> 07:22.674
Wow. You are so brave. High-five.

07:22.677 --> 07:24.152
Ha ha!

07:28.939 --> 07:30.790
♪ Out of commission ♪

07:30.792 --> 07:32.775
♪ Out of control now ♪

07:32.778 --> 07:37.130
♪ It can feel like a shell
with no answer inside ♪

07:37.132 --> 07:40.541
♪ And the paint,
though, it's justified ♪

07:40.543 --> 07:42.884
♪ Oh, but I cannot deal... ♪

07:42.887 --> 07:44.313
Late night?

07:44.316 --> 07:46.304
Sophie, hey.

07:46.307 --> 07:48.832
If you're looking for
Kate, she's not here.

07:48.835 --> 07:50.643
In fact, she rarely comes home.

07:50.645 --> 07:52.461
You know, I wouldn't be surprised

07:52.463 --> 07:54.480
if she was, uh, dating again,

07:54.482 --> 07:56.407
seeing as she's single

07:56.410 --> 07:57.750
and gorgeous

07:57.752 --> 07:59.134
and emotionally available.

07:59.136 --> 08:00.662
Do you normally stay out all night

08:00.665 --> 08:03.322
when a psychopath is
targeting your family?

08:03.324 --> 08:04.924
What was I supposed to do,

08:04.927 --> 08:09.278
not go to Kylie Q's Glam Jam
and miss next summer's colors?

08:09.280 --> 08:10.571
You're in danger, Mary.

08:10.573 --> 08:14.316
Okay. Well, I also have a life, so...

08:14.318 --> 08:17.445
So your father just
made me your bodyguard.

08:17.457 --> 08:19.474
I'm sorry. What?

08:25.569 --> 08:27.122
That is not your desk.

08:27.125 --> 08:29.163
Shh.

08:29.166 --> 08:31.184
Do you hear that?

08:31.186 --> 08:34.378
That is the sound of me

08:34.380 --> 08:36.489
officially having more money

08:36.491 --> 08:37.957
than Bruce Wayne.

08:37.961 --> 08:40.006
Tommy Elliot.

08:40.010 --> 08:41.844
How the hell did you even get in here?

08:41.846 --> 08:43.520
Oh. What's up, Candy Kane?

08:43.523 --> 08:46.273
What? Bruce never showed
you the hide-a-key?

08:46.275 --> 08:47.733
Wait. I thought you were... you were

08:47.735 --> 08:51.044
buffing up on some
lesbian ninja retreat.

08:51.047 --> 08:52.577
Why are you here, Tommy?

08:52.580 --> 08:55.397
Come here. Check it out.

08:55.400 --> 08:58.776
Now you see this building?

08:58.779 --> 09:00.379
I just bought it.

09:00.381 --> 09:02.871
5 stories taller than Wayne Tower.

09:02.874 --> 09:05.033
Bruce and Tommy, childhood friends

09:05.035 --> 09:07.751
who still act like children.

09:07.754 --> 09:09.371
What is a friend?

09:09.373 --> 09:13.726
A single sole dwelling
in two bodies, right?

09:13.728 --> 09:15.794
Is that some secret society thing?

09:15.796 --> 09:18.898
Heh. It's an Aristotle thing.

09:18.900 --> 09:21.475
Gotham has gotten all intense

09:21.477 --> 09:23.978
now that Batman's back.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.296
I mean, have you heard?

09:25.298 --> 09:28.908
Gotham's Dark Knight has
the city swooning again.

09:28.910 --> 09:32.841
I saw the picture. Yeah. It was, uh...

09:32.844 --> 09:34.271
Pixelated.

09:34.273 --> 09:38.584
Wow. I... that's your reaction?

09:38.586 --> 09:42.404
The guy had... your mom

09:42.406 --> 09:46.167
and your sister in his win column.

09:46.169 --> 09:48.928
He blinked...

09:48.930 --> 09:51.097
And they died.

09:52.624 --> 09:55.341
Oh, Kate. I thought you'd be more upset.

09:55.344 --> 09:57.812
I've had time to process.

09:57.814 --> 10:02.758
Batman saved your mom's
life a few years later.

10:02.760 --> 10:05.719
Guess he's not a total
deadbeat, you know?

10:05.721 --> 10:09.012
So, um, where's, uh, Brucey boy?

10:09.015 --> 10:12.601
I wanted to, uh, invite him to celebrate

10:12.603 --> 10:14.028
my new pile of bricks.

10:14.030 --> 10:16.139
Bruce hasn't been in Gotham for 3 years.

10:16.142 --> 10:18.379
- You know that.
- Yeah, but he's back now.

10:18.382 --> 10:20.067
- No, he's not.
- Pretty sure he is.

10:20.070 --> 10:21.525
Trust me. I'd know.

10:21.528 --> 10:25.119
Well, maybe just leave it on his desk.

10:25.122 --> 10:27.250
Will do.

10:39.222 --> 10:40.301
Where are you?

10:40.304 --> 10:41.796
Where are you?

10:41.799 --> 10:43.316
Needless to say, this is not what

10:43.318 --> 10:45.318
Wayne's advanced weaponry
vault should look like.

10:45.320 --> 10:46.861
The tech in here is top secret.

10:46.863 --> 10:49.063
If something was taken, it's bad.

10:49.065 --> 10:51.065
Had to be Alice's gang, right?

10:51.067 --> 10:52.658
Did you pull the security footage?

10:52.660 --> 10:54.340
They jammed the cameras.

10:56.313 --> 10:59.073
It'll take a minute to
figure out what they took,

10:59.075 --> 11:01.242
but in the meantime, I'll call Bruce,

11:01.244 --> 11:02.985
tell him what happened.

11:02.987 --> 11:05.755
You really expect him to answer?

11:07.174 --> 11:10.866
One of his properties containing
millions of dollars worth

11:10.869 --> 11:13.662
of weaponry was compromised.

11:13.664 --> 11:16.423
If something was gonna
get Bruce's attention,

11:16.425 --> 11:18.876
it'd be this.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.615
What is this?

11:20.618 --> 11:22.860
Not yours.

11:22.863 --> 11:25.351
Two-way grappling hook, okay?

11:25.354 --> 11:27.509
Twice the hook, twice
the chance for disaster.

11:27.511 --> 11:29.636
Possible 1054 at "Gotham City Gazette".

11:29.638 --> 11:30.896
10-4 on the "Gazette".

11:30.898 --> 11:32.345
Clear the area. We're en route now.

11:32.348 --> 11:33.445
Code 10.

11:33.448 --> 11:35.367
Okay. You stay back,
figure out what they took.

11:35.370 --> 11:37.705
- I'm gonna check this out.
- Okay.

11:40.677 --> 11:43.209
- Oh, my God. This is horrible.
- Oh, my God.

11:54.775 --> 11:57.001
Who would do this to Batman?

11:57.908 --> 12:02.376
_

12:02.379 --> 12:04.572
I tried to be Batman, Bruce,

12:04.575 --> 12:08.142
and I drew out your
enemies in the process.

12:08.144 --> 12:09.643
Today, it's an effigy.

12:09.645 --> 12:12.630
What happens when your
enemies start to kill real people

12:12.633 --> 12:14.734
in order to draw you out?

12:14.737 --> 12:16.650
The Gotham you set out to protect

12:16.652 --> 12:18.891
is now less safe because of me.

12:22.822 --> 12:24.942
So what's the deal, Batman?

12:24.945 --> 12:26.998
Are we really gonna let some loser

12:27.001 --> 12:28.619
with a party store gift card

12:28.622 --> 12:30.912
and way too much time on
his hands win this one?

12:30.915 --> 12:33.387
Step out of the shadows
and into the ring.

12:33.390 --> 12:35.034
Gotham needs you.

12:37.439 --> 12:39.759
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:44.556 --> 12:48.392
So you're really doing
nothing for my game.

12:48.395 --> 12:52.078
Is there any chance that you could...

12:52.080 --> 12:55.873
kind of looking for my
future husband over here.

12:55.875 --> 12:58.807
Unfortunately, the Commander
was pretty specific.

12:58.810 --> 13:01.598
We keep a-list clients
within 10-15 feet.

13:01.601 --> 13:03.356
Joy.

13:03.359 --> 13:06.384
Biochemistry?

13:06.386 --> 13:08.386
Not exactly fodder for small talk

13:08.388 --> 13:10.441
at Kylie Q's Jam Glam party.

13:10.444 --> 13:12.630
Uh... med student.

13:12.633 --> 13:15.610
Kind of thought you
went to med school to...

13:15.612 --> 13:18.021
look for your future husband.

13:18.023 --> 13:19.897
So is my dad forcing Kate to have

13:19.899 --> 13:23.401
a pocket Crow, or is it just me?

13:23.403 --> 13:26.213
He figures since she'd
been offered a job with us

13:26.215 --> 13:28.691
that it wasn't necessary.

13:28.694 --> 13:31.087
That is so not fair.

13:37.968 --> 13:40.736
So why didn't she take the Crows job?

13:40.739 --> 13:43.545
I have no idea.

13:43.548 --> 13:47.335
I mean, she finally
gets offered a position

13:47.338 --> 13:49.719
she spent 5 years training for

13:49.721 --> 13:51.486
and doesn't take it?

13:51.489 --> 13:53.113
Doesn't make sense.

13:53.116 --> 13:54.741
You know Kate.

13:54.744 --> 13:56.845
She's crazy.

14:01.107 --> 14:03.834
So what is she doing with herself?

14:03.836 --> 14:05.775
I hear she keeps late hours, too.

14:05.785 --> 14:09.700
So are you on this assignment
to keep tabs on me or on Kate?

14:09.703 --> 14:14.744
Because I'm getting a very
distinctive jealous ex vibe.

14:14.746 --> 14:18.581
I told her to move on.

14:18.583 --> 14:22.752
You want to know why Kate's not a Crow?

14:22.754 --> 14:24.379
It's because you're a Crow.

14:24.382 --> 14:26.106
It's because 5 years
of training was easier

14:26.108 --> 14:27.840
to walk away from than going to work

14:27.842 --> 14:30.235
with the girl who broke her heart.

14:34.346 --> 14:37.057
The Batsuit is made of
a military-grade Kevlar

14:37.060 --> 14:39.886
woven with enriched carbon
nanotubes of my dad's own design.

14:39.889 --> 14:41.333
- You're screaming.
- What?!

14:41.336 --> 14:42.494
You're screaming!

14:42.497 --> 14:44.773
Oh. Sorry.

14:44.776 --> 14:47.546
This is a Desert Eagle Mark IX .50 AE,

14:47.549 --> 14:49.595
one of the most powerful
handguns in the world.

14:49.598 --> 14:53.449
It can literally blast a
hole through anything.

15:05.770 --> 15:06.812
Doesn't make a dent.

15:06.815 --> 15:10.532
Yeah. You know, it stings a
little just, uh, for reference.

15:10.535 --> 15:14.810
This... is a rail gun.

15:14.813 --> 15:17.503
Turns out this is what the
thieves took from Wayne R&D.

15:17.506 --> 15:19.673
It has a parallel
conductor that generates

15:19.676 --> 15:21.843
a pulsed force of electromagnetism,

15:21.846 --> 15:24.520
accelerating the velocity
of the projectile.

15:24.523 --> 15:27.440
It's the most lethal weapon
that Bruce ever had built.

15:27.443 --> 15:30.009
This is a prototype,

15:30.012 --> 15:32.947
but for demonstration purposes.

15:38.514 --> 15:40.873
You're gonna fix that, right?

15:40.876 --> 15:42.192
Yeah.

15:42.195 --> 15:43.832
It's the only gun that can shoot a shot

15:43.835 --> 15:45.519
strong enough to penetrate the suit.

15:45.521 --> 15:49.547
Bruce had it built in case the
suit fell into the wrong hands.

15:49.549 --> 15:53.819
Whosever in possession of
the gun can kill Batman.

15:55.664 --> 15:58.891
I put on the suit, and I
dragged out one of his enemies.

15:58.894 --> 16:02.343
Or maybe Alice doesn't like you
having her boy toy strung to a pipe.

16:02.346 --> 16:04.305
If she has the gun, she
levels the playing field.

16:04.308 --> 16:06.839
Except Alice doesn't know
that Bruce Wayne is Batman.

16:06.842 --> 16:08.209
Whoever stole the gun knew

16:08.212 --> 16:10.693
that Bruce had to have
the suit to test it on.

16:10.695 --> 16:11.770
Yeah.

16:11.772 --> 16:13.713
If they know that Bruce is Batman...

16:13.715 --> 16:16.216
Let me show you something.

16:19.388 --> 16:21.746
He's an entitled 1% asshat.

16:21.749 --> 16:24.466
Now he's inviting you to show
off his new douche château.

16:24.468 --> 16:26.723
- Point?
- The invitation wasn't for me.

16:26.726 --> 16:28.017
It was for Bruce.

16:28.020 --> 16:29.847
Tommy's adamant that he's back in town.

16:29.850 --> 16:31.183
Why would he think that?

16:31.186 --> 16:34.016
Because if Batman's back, Bruce is, too.

16:34.019 --> 16:36.311
Tommy's parents were
in that car accident.

16:36.313 --> 16:38.226
Batman pulled his mom from the fire.

16:38.229 --> 16:41.121
- Why would he want to kill him?
- No idea.

16:41.124 --> 16:42.948
I'll go ask.

16:42.951 --> 16:45.059
Or you could be Batman.

16:49.609 --> 16:53.995
Sorry. That just sounded like
Mr. That's Not Meant For You

16:53.997 --> 16:55.422
wants me to put the suit back on.

16:55.424 --> 16:56.822
If Tommy did steal the gun,

16:56.824 --> 16:58.574
he is trying to intimidate Batman.

16:58.576 --> 17:00.502
Go show him the Bat's
not afraid of anyone.

17:00.504 --> 17:04.130
- He has that.
- Yeah, and you have that

17:04.132 --> 17:06.599
and an entire city behind you.

17:06.602 --> 17:09.252
That includes me.

17:09.253 --> 17:10.877
Knowing Bruce, if he built a rail gun,

17:10.880 --> 17:12.630
he built something that can stop it,

17:12.632 --> 17:14.182
and I will figure out how to use it.

17:14.184 --> 17:15.721
You're stronger than this guy, Kate.

17:15.723 --> 17:17.473
Go kick his ass.

17:18.521 --> 17:22.561
And if I can't, I let
down an entire city.

17:22.565 --> 17:24.816
I'm not Batman, Luke.

17:53.798 --> 17:55.941
Ahh.

19:00.382 --> 19:03.491
All Crows, be on heightened alert.

19:03.493 --> 19:05.687
Hey. What are you doing?

19:05.690 --> 19:07.332
Alice, wait, wait!

19:13.711 --> 19:18.440
Oh. Kate's gonna be so disappointed.

19:24.123 --> 19:27.308
♪ I've been havin' dreams ♪

19:27.310 --> 19:28.792
Elliot party.

19:28.794 --> 19:33.005
♪ Jumpin' on a trampoline ♪

19:33.007 --> 19:35.674
♪ Flippin' in the air ♪

19:36.894 --> 19:39.695
♪ I never land, just float there ♪

19:39.697 --> 19:41.132
Oh.

19:41.135 --> 19:44.219
Hey.

19:44.222 --> 19:46.643
What is happening here?

19:46.645 --> 19:50.355
Your dad assigned me as
Mary's security detail.

19:50.357 --> 19:52.691
- That sucks.
- No kidding,

19:52.693 --> 19:54.359
but what was I supposed to do,

19:54.361 --> 19:55.744
miss the party of the weekend

19:55.746 --> 19:57.746
because I have a full-time babysitter?

19:57.748 --> 19:59.832
Can't have the Queen
of Gotham's party scene

19:59.834 --> 20:02.510
go radio silent on socials.

20:04.880 --> 20:06.589
What about you, Kate?

20:06.591 --> 20:09.368
What brings you to an adult frat house?

20:09.371 --> 20:11.639
I was told to move on.

20:13.964 --> 20:18.910
♪ I never feel so loved ♪

20:18.913 --> 20:20.676
We get it, Tommy.

20:20.679 --> 20:24.014
Could you live any higher?

20:40.115 --> 20:42.174
What can I get you?

20:42.176 --> 20:44.046
Just looking for the man of the hour.

20:44.049 --> 20:46.709
He's around, but if you
want to save yourself

20:46.712 --> 20:48.733
from a verbal carwash
of veiled misogyny,

20:48.736 --> 20:50.326
you might want to plant yourself here.

20:50.329 --> 20:51.329
He'll be by soon.

20:51.332 --> 20:53.767
In that case, I will have a beer.

20:57.257 --> 20:59.233
I'm Reagan, by the way.

20:59.235 --> 21:02.552
Kate Kane. Thought that was you.

21:02.554 --> 21:04.905
Tyler. We, uh... we met a few weeks ago.

21:04.907 --> 21:08.433
Sophie's husband. I remember.

21:08.435 --> 21:09.652
You know, I hate these things.

21:09.654 --> 21:11.103
Guy has 10 contracts with the Crows,

21:11.105 --> 21:13.108
so we all come here to kiss his ass.

21:13.111 --> 21:15.637
Well, at least you get
to work with your wife.

21:15.640 --> 21:17.233
Yeah. You know, speaking of,

21:17.236 --> 21:19.420
I... I didn't catch how you
and Sophie know each other.

21:19.422 --> 21:20.466
What do you mean?

21:20.469 --> 21:22.664
Well, she... she never
told me she was friends

21:22.667 --> 21:24.833
with the boss's daughter.

21:24.835 --> 21:26.911
She didn't tell you who I am.

21:26.914 --> 21:28.914
No.

21:28.917 --> 21:32.232
I'm Kate... from Point Rock.

21:32.251 --> 21:34.602
Oh. Oh, you went to
the Academy together.

21:34.604 --> 21:37.438
Right. That explains it.

21:37.440 --> 21:40.399
That explains it. Ahem.

21:41.999 --> 21:43.352
Well, boss is here.

21:43.354 --> 21:46.072
You have a nice night,
Kate from Point Rock.

21:47.450 --> 21:50.785
He married your ex and has no idea.

21:50.787 --> 21:52.928
Wow! You're good.

21:52.931 --> 21:54.980
Professional level. Started bartending

21:54.982 --> 21:56.124
before I could drink.

21:56.127 --> 21:57.490
You learn to read people.

21:57.493 --> 21:59.108
All right.

21:59.111 --> 22:01.653
- Read him for me.
- Tommy Elliot?

22:01.655 --> 22:04.081
- Mm-hmm.
- Danger. Hazardous waste.

22:04.083 --> 22:05.949
King of real estate.
Thinks he's doing us

22:05.952 --> 22:08.841
all a favor when he really just helps

22:08.844 --> 22:11.455
fund the walls that are
separating our city.

22:11.457 --> 22:14.055
Gotham. Am I right?

22:14.058 --> 22:15.849
Yeah.

22:20.316 --> 22:23.414
Thank goodness. Someone
who loathes Tommy Elliot

22:23.417 --> 22:24.709
as much as me.

22:24.712 --> 22:26.887
Isn't he one of your biggest clients?

22:26.890 --> 22:28.040
Unfortunately.

22:28.043 --> 22:29.459
Well, I'm glad you're here, Kate.

22:29.462 --> 22:31.807
It means you're not out
gallivanting with Alice.

22:31.810 --> 22:35.608
You would tell me if she'd
reached out to you again, right?

22:35.611 --> 22:38.523
I don't think Alice is
gonna be a problem today.

22:38.525 --> 22:40.385
What's that supposed to mean?

22:40.388 --> 22:42.114
Twin instincts.

22:48.401 --> 22:50.126
Mom.

22:52.014 --> 22:54.956
Security detail? Seriously?

22:54.959 --> 22:57.662
Unfortunately, this is the
world we're living in now.

22:57.665 --> 23:01.073
Well, I need my world to have
a little bit more elbow room.

23:01.076 --> 23:05.094
I can't even reapply lip gloss
without getting poked by an AK.

23:06.845 --> 23:09.196
Nice view of Wayne Tower.

23:09.198 --> 23:11.198
Well, took half my life,

23:11.200 --> 23:14.610
but I'm finally looking
down on Bruce Wayne.

23:14.612 --> 23:17.705
What makes you think he's back?

23:17.707 --> 23:19.281
We're cosmic besties.

23:19.283 --> 23:21.283
And here I thought I
was his favorite cousin.

23:21.285 --> 23:23.568
Not even a phone call.

23:23.570 --> 23:26.029
Well, he's a busy man.

23:26.031 --> 23:28.047
You're right. He's probably preoccupied

23:28.050 --> 23:29.866
with that break-in at Wayne R&D.

23:29.876 --> 23:34.188
They stole a specialized, uh, firearm.

23:36.719 --> 23:38.036
That sucks.

23:38.039 --> 23:39.999
Good news is the morons
who took it probably don't

23:40.023 --> 23:42.304
realize there's a hidden GPS
tracker inside the device,

23:42.306 --> 23:44.101
and... pbbb... it's
only a matter of time

23:44.104 --> 23:47.735
before Wayne Security come
knocking on their door.

23:47.737 --> 23:50.053
Hmm.

24:03.068 --> 24:04.476
Kane.

24:12.047 --> 24:14.077
Who is this?

24:14.079 --> 24:16.849
Heh heh. You taught me, remember,

24:16.852 --> 24:19.519
or did you give up on music
like you gave up on me?

24:19.522 --> 24:21.751
What are you trying to do, Alice?

24:21.753 --> 24:24.939
You're not getting in my head.

24:24.941 --> 24:31.290
Heh. You'd be surprised where
I can get into, Commander.

24:31.293 --> 24:32.687
Where are you?

24:36.059 --> 24:37.976
Well, I could tell you,

24:37.978 --> 24:41.438
but that would ruin the surprise.

24:41.440 --> 24:45.251
Let's talk until you're
finished tracing my call.

24:49.990 --> 24:55.160
I never understood why
you stopped looking for me.

24:55.162 --> 24:58.138
I always thought a father would do

24:58.140 --> 25:00.457
anything to find his daughter...

25:00.459 --> 25:03.385
Swim oceans, move mountains,

25:03.387 --> 25:04.794
but now I get it.

25:04.797 --> 25:07.387
You're on top of the mountain.

25:07.390 --> 25:12.135
Heh. If I had this view, I'd
stop looking for me, too.

25:12.137 --> 25:14.989
More time to enjoy your new life.

25:14.991 --> 25:16.848
How'd you get in my house?

25:16.850 --> 25:18.008
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

25:18.010 --> 25:20.852
Oh. You should be ashamed, Commander.

25:20.854 --> 25:25.718
King of the Crows, can't
even protect your own nest.

25:25.721 --> 25:28.576
I'm coming for you.

25:28.579 --> 25:32.338
Maybe if you'd uttered
those words 15 years ago,

25:32.341 --> 25:34.082
we wouldn't be here now.

25:34.084 --> 25:36.539
I won't let you forget me, Commander,

25:36.542 --> 25:38.476
not again.

26:37.573 --> 26:39.523
- We need to leave now.
- What is it?

26:39.525 --> 26:41.002
I'll explain downstairs.

26:41.005 --> 26:43.002
Kane to Moore. Get Kate and Mary

26:43.005 --> 26:44.885
in an armored truck until
I deal with something.

26:44.909 --> 26:46.124
Copy that.

26:46.127 --> 26:47.543
Mary.

26:47.546 --> 26:49.346
What's happening?

26:49.349 --> 26:51.723
Oh... I'm... okay.

26:53.071 --> 26:55.631
- Hey. Where's Kate?
- Probably left.

26:55.634 --> 26:57.768
I'll text her.

27:06.293 --> 27:08.917
That's some gun you got there.

27:08.920 --> 27:12.629
Ahem. Party's not in here, Candy Kane.

27:12.632 --> 27:17.519
It's over, Tommy. This isn't yours.

27:17.521 --> 27:19.234
You don't want to get in my way.

27:19.237 --> 27:22.431
- How do you know who he is?
- You mean Batman?

27:22.434 --> 27:25.786
Oops. Did I say that out loud?

27:25.788 --> 27:27.077
How do you know that?

27:27.080 --> 27:29.623
Oh, because a few
months ago I paid a man

27:29.625 --> 27:31.170
to riddle me the answer.

27:31.173 --> 27:34.337
Gotta love the honorable
Bruce Wayne for designing

27:34.340 --> 27:38.114
a failsafe so he could never become
too powerful in his supersuit.

27:38.116 --> 27:39.399
He is such a great guy.

27:39.402 --> 27:40.903
He's your best friend.

27:40.906 --> 27:43.222
Yeah, he was. The bestest.

27:43.225 --> 27:45.713
Nothing could be average with Bruce.

27:45.716 --> 27:48.050
Even had to have more
dead parents than me.

27:48.052 --> 27:49.959
Because he saved your mom's life.

27:49.961 --> 27:51.768
Oh, yeah. No. I am aware.

27:51.771 --> 27:55.390
Thanks to him, instead of
collecting my inheritance,

27:55.392 --> 27:57.615
I was left wiping the spittle

27:57.618 --> 28:01.279
of a jabbering madwoman's
lips for 13 years.

28:01.282 --> 28:02.740
If you wanted him dead, why wait

28:02.743 --> 28:04.641
until he's in a bulletproof suit?

28:04.643 --> 28:06.601
Because Bruce didn't ruin my life.

28:06.603 --> 28:09.628
Batman did. Do you know what it's like

28:09.631 --> 28:14.359
to have the villain of your
story be the hero of your city?

28:14.361 --> 28:17.195
He is a monster, who left me anchored

28:17.197 --> 28:20.365
to a repulsive, gold-digging bitch,

28:20.367 --> 28:22.033
and now he's gonna die.

28:24.287 --> 28:26.545
Well, that answers that.

28:26.548 --> 28:28.714
Bruce's is bigger.

28:41.431 --> 28:42.980
Aah!

28:47.346 --> 28:49.239
- Aah!
- Hold it!

28:57.762 --> 28:58.861
What did you do?

28:58.864 --> 29:01.905
You have Batman meet me on the roof,

29:01.908 --> 29:04.754
or the elevators I just hijacked,

29:04.757 --> 29:06.090
they start to drop.

29:06.093 --> 29:07.786
Batman isn't here.

29:07.789 --> 29:09.463
Yeah, because he's hiding.

29:09.466 --> 29:12.300
It's time for Gotham's hero to man up.

29:12.302 --> 29:14.210
Next one's in an hour.

29:14.212 --> 29:16.379
It'll look like this

29:16.381 --> 29:19.650
but with people the
city will actually miss.

29:33.817 --> 29:35.826
Oh, my God!

29:40.601 --> 29:42.842
It's my leg.

29:42.844 --> 29:45.270
I'm so sorry.

29:45.272 --> 29:47.156
You're gonna be okay.

29:47.159 --> 29:49.115
Help him.

29:49.118 --> 29:52.077
Okay? And then check all the elevators.

29:55.532 --> 29:57.282
I swear I heard something crash.

29:57.284 --> 29:59.567
Yeah. Me, too. Does
anyone have reception?

29:59.569 --> 30:02.862
Moore to base. Check, check. Hello?

30:02.864 --> 30:04.623
How is our signal dead?

30:04.625 --> 30:08.545
Hello? FYI, I'm a
social media influencer,

30:08.548 --> 30:10.489
so if you people don't
want a scathing review

30:10.492 --> 30:12.914
of your building's safety,
you should hop to it!

30:12.916 --> 30:15.917
No service. I hope Mary's okay.

30:15.919 --> 30:18.054
Why did you pull us out of there?

30:20.232 --> 30:22.766
- Alice.
- Alice?

30:22.768 --> 30:24.744
Is she the reason we're stuck right now?

30:24.747 --> 30:26.747
Very well could be.

30:26.750 --> 30:32.150
She just called me from our penthouse.

30:32.153 --> 30:33.444
What?

30:33.447 --> 30:36.049
I swear if this is Alice
I'm gonna be so pissed.

30:36.052 --> 30:37.477
They'll find us, babe.

30:37.480 --> 30:39.562
Oh, my God.

30:39.565 --> 30:41.090
What?

30:41.093 --> 30:44.644
Nothing. I just totally
forgot you two were married.

30:44.647 --> 30:47.523
3 years but still full of surprises.

30:47.526 --> 30:49.283
Saw Kate inside.

30:49.286 --> 30:51.869
You two went to Point Rock together?

30:51.872 --> 30:54.945
Yeah, we did. Why?

30:54.948 --> 30:57.249
Was it a secret or something?

30:57.252 --> 30:59.598
No. Why would it be a secret?

30:59.601 --> 31:01.429
I don't know. Why would
you never mention her?

31:01.431 --> 31:03.271
She's our boss's daughter.

31:03.274 --> 31:06.088
Didn't I mention her?

31:06.091 --> 31:08.352
No, Soph, you didn't.

31:08.355 --> 31:10.958
I don't know. We weren't that close.

31:10.961 --> 31:12.858
Never occurred to me.

31:12.860 --> 31:16.528
Anyone want to try
prying open the doors?

31:16.530 --> 31:18.031
How the hell did she get inside?

31:18.034 --> 31:19.680
I have no idea.

31:19.683 --> 31:22.794
How can this city trust us to protect it

31:22.797 --> 31:24.463
when we can't even keep ourselves safe?

31:24.466 --> 31:26.506
- We'll contain it.
- We should have contained Alice

31:26.508 --> 31:27.611
when we had the chance.

31:27.614 --> 31:29.966
Trust me. That was the plan.

31:29.969 --> 31:32.730
Kate threatened to
cut me out of her life.

31:32.733 --> 31:35.120
What was I supposed to do?

31:41.597 --> 31:44.044
All right. I'll go and
help pull you out, okay?

31:44.047 --> 31:46.464
Okay.

31:46.467 --> 31:48.644
Okay. Come on.

31:51.616 --> 31:53.231
All right. We should split up and see

31:53.233 --> 31:54.286
if anyone else is stuck.

31:54.289 --> 31:55.661
Okay.

31:55.664 --> 31:58.376
- I know what you're gonna s...
- I didn't say anything.

32:00.749 --> 32:03.013
Why are you here? He's
gonna drop another one.

32:03.016 --> 32:05.076
I know that. All those
people are hurt because

32:05.078 --> 32:06.319
I put the suit on.

32:06.321 --> 32:08.228
- It's not your fault, Kate.
- It is, Luke.

32:08.231 --> 32:09.447
It is my fault.

32:09.450 --> 32:11.150
I brought this to Gotham.

32:11.153 --> 32:13.159
Tommy today, someone else tomorrow.

32:13.161 --> 32:14.903
This is on me.

32:14.905 --> 32:18.706
You said if anything was gonna get
Bruce's attention, it would be this.

32:18.708 --> 32:21.092
I need you to be real with me.

32:21.094 --> 32:23.604
Do you think he's coming back?

32:24.768 --> 32:27.495
- Luke.
- No.

32:30.265 --> 32:32.115
Tommy wants Batman.

32:32.118 --> 32:34.452
The city needs Batman,

32:34.455 --> 32:36.789
and I am not Batman.

32:39.446 --> 32:43.332
But maybe I'm better because I'm here.

32:44.710 --> 32:47.902
How long's that gonna take to fix?

32:47.904 --> 32:50.636
- There aren't enough.
- What?

32:50.639 --> 32:52.289
EMTs.

32:52.292 --> 32:56.858
Ma'am, how are you feeling?

32:56.861 --> 32:58.411
Ma'am?

33:00.417 --> 33:03.710
Any head pain, headache?

33:03.712 --> 33:05.290
This woman needs help now.

33:05.293 --> 33:06.472
We already checked her.

33:06.475 --> 33:07.861
Well, check her again.

33:07.864 --> 33:09.815
Mary, they're professionals.

33:09.818 --> 33:11.400
You're a second-year med student.

33:11.403 --> 33:13.111
She's got a headache and a blown pupil.

33:13.113 --> 33:16.467
Could be a subdural or
an epidural hemorrhage.

33:16.470 --> 33:18.054
I read ahead.

33:18.057 --> 33:20.199
You're right. Thanks.

33:25.000 --> 33:28.776
Your friend Tommy wants
to kill you, Bruce,

33:28.778 --> 33:32.113
and since you're not here,

33:32.115 --> 33:34.279
it looks like I'm gonna
have to kick his ass

33:34.282 --> 33:36.491
on your behalf...

33:40.831 --> 33:42.840
And send a message to anyone else

33:42.843 --> 33:44.601
who'd come after you,

33:44.603 --> 33:49.014
but to do that, I need to
be honest with the city

33:49.016 --> 33:51.592
that I'm not you.

33:51.595 --> 33:53.595
I'm me.

34:25.052 --> 34:27.572
You're not Batman.

34:27.574 --> 34:29.179
That's the point.

34:33.127 --> 34:34.210
Who the hell are you?

34:34.213 --> 34:37.103
I want Batman, not his side piece.

34:37.106 --> 34:38.355
I found Tommy.

34:38.358 --> 34:39.922
Activate the disruptor in the gauntlet.

34:39.926 --> 34:42.083
When the light flashes green,
his gun will neutralize.

34:42.087 --> 34:43.308
Yeah. That's not happening.

34:43.311 --> 34:45.437
- Did you charge the glove?
- Wait. What?

34:45.440 --> 34:47.081
Where's Batman?

34:49.143 --> 34:50.592
Okay. Activated the charge.

34:50.594 --> 34:52.581
You need to stall for 30 seconds.

34:53.862 --> 34:55.295
Unh!

34:55.297 --> 34:57.005
Stalling.

35:22.156 --> 35:23.526
I'm done with you.

35:23.529 --> 35:25.169
Ugh!

35:25.172 --> 35:26.647
No!

35:36.390 --> 35:37.782
What the hell is that?

35:37.784 --> 35:40.451
Don't move. It's not stable.

35:56.739 --> 35:58.563
What the hell was that?

36:01.175 --> 36:04.003
See you at the bottom.

36:24.494 --> 36:27.787
Let... go.

36:29.727 --> 36:31.352
Unh!

36:39.345 --> 36:41.912
A red wig?

36:41.914 --> 36:44.057
And I'm the crazy one.

37:05.105 --> 37:07.039
You saved my life.

37:09.883 --> 37:11.151
Guess we're even.

37:11.154 --> 37:12.820
This place is crawling with Crows.

37:12.823 --> 37:14.373
You shouldn't be here.

37:14.376 --> 37:16.439
Well, I came to crash the party.

37:16.441 --> 37:18.108
Turns out our host beat me to it.

37:18.110 --> 37:20.891
I didn't know that it
was a costume party.

37:20.894 --> 37:23.703
Let me guess...

37:23.706 --> 37:25.540
Red.

37:29.079 --> 37:31.788
The color of our birthstone.

37:31.790 --> 37:35.668
To remind us where we came from.

37:35.671 --> 37:37.127
About that.

37:37.129 --> 37:39.101
They say if you want to quit

37:39.104 --> 37:40.645
you have to really want to,

37:40.648 --> 37:44.301
and, well, I didn't want to.

37:44.303 --> 37:46.854
You see, 24 hours is a really long time.

37:46.856 --> 37:50.348
Guess you're gonna have to
let my sweet Dodgson die.

37:50.350 --> 37:52.702
Like I said...

37:52.712 --> 37:54.668
Beth is gone.

37:54.671 --> 37:56.379
Then why save me?

37:56.382 --> 38:00.324
Because I have plans for you, Kate.

38:00.327 --> 38:02.819
That, and it's no fun
torturing a corpse.

38:02.821 --> 38:05.113
Believe me, I've tried.

38:05.115 --> 38:07.349
Anyhoo, good luck on the upkeep.

38:07.352 --> 38:08.876
You think Tommy's annoying.

38:08.878 --> 38:12.045
Wait till your roots grow in.

38:12.047 --> 38:13.768
If you kill again, it's over,

38:13.771 --> 38:17.351
and I will stop thinking
of you as my sister.

38:17.353 --> 38:22.130
You're finally... catching... on.

38:22.132 --> 38:26.059
That is exactly what I want.

38:26.061 --> 38:28.153
You say that, but it's not true,

38:28.155 --> 38:30.948
and I know you know that, too.

39:03.621 --> 39:05.913
Right money in the right hands.

39:05.916 --> 39:08.385
I will be out in an hour.

39:08.387 --> 39:09.937
They're taking you to Arkham, Tommy.

39:09.939 --> 39:11.802
Good luck buying your way out of that.

39:11.805 --> 39:13.546
You tell Bruce that I won't stop

39:13.549 --> 39:17.275
until he shows his face.

39:17.278 --> 39:18.593
Reagan.

39:18.596 --> 39:20.746
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:20.749 --> 39:22.940
There you are.

39:22.943 --> 39:24.533
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

39:24.536 --> 39:28.080
I guess Tommy's a bigger
dick than I thought.

39:28.082 --> 39:31.241
So that whole I can read people thing,

39:31.243 --> 39:33.752
yeah, so you're into me.

39:33.754 --> 39:35.537
I mean, you would know.

39:35.539 --> 39:37.872
You're the professional.

39:37.874 --> 39:40.083
Cool. I'll call you then.

39:40.085 --> 39:42.227
I'd like that.

40:10.129 --> 40:11.670
Catherine?

40:11.792 --> 40:13.917
Catherine?

40:13.920 --> 40:17.286
There you are. You okay?

40:17.289 --> 40:20.749
Alice broke into our home
and murdered that guard.

40:20.751 --> 40:22.175
You have to stop her, Jacob.

40:22.177 --> 40:24.250
I know. We're gonna find her.

40:24.253 --> 40:25.678
And put an end to this.

40:25.681 --> 40:27.389
When Alice called, she was playing

40:27.392 --> 40:33.111
a song on Beth's cello... Bach.

40:33.114 --> 40:35.752
I used to tell Beth it was our song.

40:35.755 --> 40:39.267
She could have found one
of Beth's recitals online.

40:39.269 --> 40:42.215
You're smarter than that, Jacob.

40:42.218 --> 40:44.528
Jacob, don't let her in.

40:47.843 --> 40:51.154
I wasn't afraid of
letting down the city.

40:51.156 --> 40:55.658
I was afraid of letting down you, Bruce,

40:55.660 --> 40:57.636
but whatever happens,

40:57.638 --> 41:00.329
whatever I face,

41:00.332 --> 41:02.049
it's worth it.

41:02.052 --> 41:04.618
Okay, Gotham. Someone just dropped

41:04.621 --> 41:08.171
a bombshell on this city,
and I mean that literally.

41:08.173 --> 41:10.006
The Bat is back...

41:10.008 --> 41:12.450
Just curvier and sexier,

41:12.453 --> 41:15.034
so the big question, what
are we calling her...

41:15.037 --> 41:16.827
Batlady, Batchick?

41:16.830 --> 41:19.604
Talk to me, Gotham. We need a name.

41:19.607 --> 41:21.256
Batwoman.

41:25.028 --> 41:28.967
