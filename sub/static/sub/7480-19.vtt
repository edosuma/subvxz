Very nice.

00:24.787 --> 00:26.889

00:31.911 --> 00:34.396
That'll be a dud,
gentlemen.

00:35.582 --> 00:37.933
Sergeant Revis,
I got an unexploded M1-HE

00:37.967 --> 00:40.802
that I need cleared
from my field ASAP.

00:40.854 --> 00:41.970
REVIS (over radio):
Sounds rockin'.

00:41.988 --> 00:43.138
We'll wake up the PackBot

00:43.156 --> 00:45.157
and blow your projectile
the hell out of here.

00:52.499 --> 00:54.482
Come on, Andy,

00:54.534 --> 00:56.285
push that crap
on out the way.

00:58.487 --> 01:00.255
This is a damn three-foot-
long, high explosive shell.

01:00.290 --> 01:01.406
Now, why can't
I see it,

01:01.441 --> 01:02.791
Corporal?

01:02.825 --> 01:04.259
Hey, w-w-wait,

01:04.294 --> 01:06.094
go back.
Whoa, I didn't see it.

01:06.129 --> 01:07.462
Back up the damn robot.

01:07.496 --> 01:08.630
Backing up.

01:13.603 --> 01:15.220
All right, l-look right.

01:15.271 --> 01:17.005
Right.

01:17.023 --> 01:18.040
Move in.

I used to be so good

Hmm. What happened,
you lose your killer mojo?

02:25.758 --> 02:27.259
Okay.

02:27.293 --> 02:28.210
Did we not have

I thought you'd be...

02:35.401 --> 02:36.885
Taller?

02:36.919 --> 02:39.354
Why do you keep killing me?

02:39.389 --> 02:43.976
Because that's the purpose
of the game, Mr. Beale,

02:44.010 --> 02:48.063
and if I catch you playing it
in OPS again,

02:48.097 --> 02:50.916
the carnage will be for real.

Hetty's orders.

03:32.825 --> 03:35.327
at the Los Cerritos
Training Base.

03:35.361 --> 03:36.611
He was a communications
specialist

03:36.645 --> 03:38.646
who worked with several
special operations units

03:38.665 --> 03:40.048
in Afghanistan.

03:40.083 --> 03:43.485
A lot of classified information
passed through those hands.

03:43.503 --> 03:44.619
Get down to the base,

03:44.653 --> 03:45.871
see if there's been
a breach in security.

04:53.489 --> 04:55.056

Hi.
Ma'am.

05:00.163 --> 05:02.614
When I heard you were coming,
I requested to be the liaison.

05:02.648 --> 05:04.699
I've heard a lot
about you.

05:04.733 --> 05:05.984
Some of it good, I hope.

05:06.018 --> 05:07.619
You're a bit of a legend.

05:07.670 --> 05:09.571
Bosnia, Iraq.

05:09.622 --> 05:11.289
Yeah, well, it's nice
to be remembered.

05:11.340 --> 05:12.407
How can I help?

05:12.425 --> 05:14.459
What do you know about Ensign Powell?
Heard some rumors

05:14.510 --> 05:17.012
he might have been a drug user,
but don't take my word for it.

05:17.046 --> 05:18.764
I don't know if he went
out there and fell asleep

05:18.798 --> 05:19.747
or what.

05:19.766 --> 05:20.915
It's crazy.

05:20.933 --> 05:21.950
CALLEN: We'll start
with Powell's unit.

05:21.984 --> 05:22.917
Kensi, Deeks.

05:22.935 --> 05:24.252
- Got it.
- Ensign McCarty will show you

05:24.270 --> 05:26.221
to the communications
department.

05:26.255 --> 05:28.023
So, what about the body?

05:28.057 --> 05:28.940
M.E. has it.

05:28.975 --> 05:30.358
She's waiting
to speak to you.

05:30.393 --> 05:33.295
I'll show you
over there.

05:33.329 --> 05:36.398
The MPs still can't find
his right lower leg

05:36.432 --> 05:37.649
or his left hand.

05:37.700 --> 05:40.602
The body had massive
concussive injuries.

05:42.438 --> 05:44.990
High explosive round
will do that to you.

05:45.041 --> 05:48.994
The thing is, he didn't die
from the artillery fire.

05:49.045 --> 05:50.629
He was stabbed.

05:50.663 --> 05:52.330
Thought it was
a shrapnel wound at first,

05:52.381 --> 05:54.749
but there was no metal
in the laceration,

05:54.783 --> 05:57.252
and judging by
the lividity,

05:57.286 --> 05:59.004
he died hours
before his body was moved

05:59.055 --> 06:00.338
out to the impact zone.

06:00.389 --> 06:02.307
It's a good place
to dump a body.

06:02.341 --> 06:04.009
You get one direct
artillery hit,

06:04.060 --> 06:05.227
there's nothing left to find.

06:05.261 --> 06:09.397
The shape of the blade
curves forward.

06:09.432 --> 06:12.234
I sketched the outline.

06:13.636 --> 06:15.303
That's a karambit knife.

06:15.338 --> 06:17.606
Shaped like the canine tooth
of a tiger.

06:17.640 --> 06:20.808
M.E.: The funny thing is, from
the irritation of the skin,

06:20.827 --> 06:23.762
I'd say that the wound
was dressed at some point.

06:23.796 --> 06:25.947
Aside from the tox screen,

06:25.981 --> 06:28.783
I'll get you my preliminary
autopsy report tomorrow.

06:28.817 --> 06:30.869
His right shoulder was pulled
from the socket?

06:30.903 --> 06:34.623
Yes, he, he bled into the joint,
so it happened

06:34.657 --> 06:36.525
while he was
still alive.

06:36.559 --> 06:38.710
How'd you know?

06:41.047 --> 06:43.765
Okay, talk to me.

06:45.601 --> 06:47.502
SEALs love knives.

06:47.520 --> 06:50.438
Like to have 'em custom forged
for their units.

06:50.506 --> 06:51.723
Different SEAL teams
learn their restraint

06:51.774 --> 06:55.110
and fighting techniques from
different combat schools,

06:55.144 --> 06:59.064
so the bruises on Powell's
body are like a signature.

06:59.115 --> 07:01.283
You think Ensign Powell
was murdered by a Navy SEAL?

07:01.317 --> 07:04.185
No. SEALs wouldn't do that.

07:04.203 --> 07:05.654
I bet my life on it.

07:05.688 --> 07:06.872
Okay.

07:06.906 --> 07:09.207
There's a lot of
copycats in the world.

07:09.242 --> 07:11.459
A lot of people move through
those combat schools.

07:11.494 --> 07:13.311
And anybody can buy
a custom knife.

07:13.346 --> 07:14.796
DEEKS: Hey.

07:15.864 --> 07:17.883
So not exactly the
friendliest place.

07:17.917 --> 07:19.867
(line ringing)

07:19.886 --> 07:21.086
NELL: Hello.

07:21.137 --> 07:24.306
SAM: Nell, I need you to reach
out to a guy named Glen Olmos.

07:24.340 --> 07:27.042
He made custom combat knives
for a lot of the SEAL teams.

07:27.076 --> 07:28.009
He's in Long Beach.

07:28.043 --> 07:29.227
M.E. is about
to send you a sketch.

07:29.262 --> 07:31.212
I want you to send
that sketch to Olmos,

07:31.230 --> 07:32.397
see what he can tell us.

07:32.431 --> 07:33.315
Okay, got it.

07:33.349 --> 07:34.933
We spoke to
Powell's unit.

07:34.984 --> 07:37.068
He's a little bit of a
player, liked to party.

07:37.103 --> 07:38.353
No one would confirm
the drug rumor.

07:38.387 --> 07:39.688
Powell was also involved

07:39.722 --> 07:43.408
in a scuffle in a bar with a
petty officer, David Hodgkins.

07:43.442 --> 07:44.776
Evidently, Powell
started dating

07:44.827 --> 07:46.695
David Hodgkins'
ex-girlfriend.

07:46.729 --> 07:48.563
Could be a motive.

07:48.581 --> 07:50.532
Petty Officer Hodgkins on base?

07:50.566 --> 07:53.018
Yeah, we figured you'd want
to handle the interview.

07:53.052 --> 07:54.035
Why?

07:54.070 --> 07:57.071
Because he's a SEAL.

08:02.795 --> 08:04.912
What can I
do for you?

08:04.931 --> 08:07.299
We need to speak
with your SEAL team.

08:07.350 --> 08:08.967
Most of my team is stationed
in Afghanistan.

08:09.018 --> 08:10.001
What's this about?

08:10.036 --> 08:11.853
Ensign Powell's murder.

08:16.859 --> 08:18.426
You accusing Navy
SEALs of murder?

08:18.444 --> 08:19.945
Is that what
I'm hearing?

08:19.979 --> 08:22.597
Only six members
of my team are still here,

08:22.615 --> 08:24.199
but they're
on the tarmac now.

08:24.233 --> 08:25.283
They're about to embark

08:25.318 --> 08:26.952
on a highly classified
rescue mission.

08:26.986 --> 08:28.153
Well, I need you
to hold that plane

08:28.204 --> 08:29.871
until we've had a chance
to speak with them.

08:29.905 --> 08:31.323
Let me explain this
to you, Agent Callen,

08:31.374 --> 08:33.658
give you a chance to
back off your position.

08:33.693 --> 08:35.159
You have
security clearance.

08:35.211 --> 08:36.660
My men are going
to the Hindu Kush

08:36.712 --> 08:39.113
on the Afghanistan-
Pakistan border.

08:39.131 --> 08:40.664
Two Americans were
kidnapped last month.

08:40.716 --> 08:42.667
Loretta Davis--

08:42.717 --> 08:44.469
she's a CIA field
agent and a good one

08:44.503 --> 08:47.455
who's put her life on the line
for the last eight years.

08:47.473 --> 08:48.790
Also taken hostage

08:48.808 --> 08:50.291
was Mark Rowe,

08:50.309 --> 08:52.260
a civilian
military contractor.

08:52.294 --> 08:53.578
I've heard of Rowe.

08:53.613 --> 08:55.129
You should.

08:55.147 --> 08:57.015
He's a former SEAL.

08:58.768 --> 09:01.786
They're going to get
one of their own back.

09:01.821 --> 09:03.405
Once a SEAL, always a SEAL.

09:03.439 --> 09:04.856
You should know that,
Agent Hanna.

09:04.907 --> 09:07.242
Protocol dictates there's a
backup team ready to step in.

09:07.276 --> 09:08.326
These are the caves
where we have

09:08.361 --> 09:10.612
reconnaissance photos
of the hostages.

09:10.646 --> 09:12.313
It's a maze of tunnels.

09:12.331 --> 09:14.866
16 months ago, these same
six men took those tunnels

09:14.917 --> 09:16.284
and occupied them
for four days.

09:16.319 --> 09:18.286
So those six SEALs
are the only men

09:18.320 --> 09:20.705
who know these tunnels well
enough to execute the rescue.

09:20.740 --> 09:23.324
The Taliban are moving Rowe
and Davis every three days.

09:23.342 --> 09:26.127
They've been in this location
now almost 45 hours.

09:26.161 --> 09:27.796
Given it will take
the team 18 hours

09:27.830 --> 09:29.664
to fly there
and get into position...

09:29.682 --> 09:30.715
Got roughly a seven-hour window

09:30.766 --> 09:32.550
to get the team back
on the plane.

09:32.601 --> 09:34.552
Let's not cut it that close,
Agent Hanna.

09:34.603 --> 09:38.189
We'll get them back on mission
as fast as possible.

09:38.224 --> 09:40.558
You know what
you're asking me to do.

09:41.510 --> 09:44.178
Commander, please make the call.

09:51.737 --> 09:53.020
(brakes screeching)

09:53.039 --> 09:55.023
Who's Agent Callen?

09:55.057 --> 09:56.541
That's me.

09:56.575 --> 09:58.043
You'd better have
a damn good reason

09:58.077 --> 09:59.711
for pulling my men
off that plane.

09:59.745 --> 10:01.029
I do.

10:01.063 --> 10:02.580
Need to ask you and your men
some questions.

10:02.631 --> 10:03.548
About what?

10:03.582 --> 10:05.467
About the murder
of Ensign Aaron Powell.

10:05.501 --> 10:06.835
Guy's dead.

10:06.869 --> 10:07.969
Hostages
are alive.

10:08.003 --> 10:09.137
Questions can wait
till we get back.

10:09.171 --> 10:11.256
Couple hours of your time
is all we need, Chief.

10:11.307 --> 10:13.124
Chief, Special Agent Hanna--
he's one of us.

10:13.159 --> 10:15.677
D.O.D. wants this
taken care of now.

10:15.711 --> 10:18.713
Is he suggesting that one
of my team is a murderer?

10:18.731 --> 10:20.632
- Just got a job to do, Chief.
- Why doesn't he answer?

10:20.666 --> 10:22.817
Say it to my face--
we're murderers?

10:22.852 --> 10:24.235
SAM: Stand down.
KENSI: I'm calling the MPs.

10:24.270 --> 10:26.721
- MPs aren't going to help you.
- Stand down!

10:38.001 --> 10:41.016
All right, I'm ready
for my close-up, Ms. Lange.

10:41.018 --> 10:43.219
Good connection,
Mr. Deeks.

10:43.270 --> 10:46.505
Mr. Hanna, are you ready?

10:48.342 --> 10:50.944
Let's start
with Chief Petty Officer Green.

10:53.013 --> 10:55.899
CALLEN: What do you know
about Ensign Powell?

10:55.950 --> 10:57.116
GREEN: Barely knew him.

10:57.151 --> 10:58.418
He occasionally worked
with my team

10:58.452 --> 11:00.854
providing
communications services.

11:01.525 --> 11:03.709
Ensign Powell
was murdered last night

11:03.744 --> 11:05.812
between 6:00 and 10:00 p.m.

11:05.846 --> 11:07.096
Where were you?

11:07.130 --> 11:09.499
I was at the movies
in Long Beach with my team.

11:09.533 --> 11:10.399
What'd you see?

11:10.434 --> 11:12.185
It was called <i>Netscape.</i>

11:12.219 --> 11:13.302
What was it about?

11:13.337 --> 11:15.271
Guy took over
people's lives,

11:15.305 --> 11:17.640
stole their identity
via the Internet.

11:17.674 --> 11:18.908
You can ask my men.

11:18.942 --> 11:20.309
And they'll back you up.

11:20.344 --> 11:22.845
I'm sure somebody saw
us at the theater.

11:25.616 --> 11:27.567
Are you aware of an incident

11:27.618 --> 11:29.869
involving the victim,
Ensign Powell,

11:29.903 --> 11:31.470
and Petty Officer Hodgkins?

11:31.505 --> 11:34.123
Hodgkins is an extraordinary
sailor and human being.

11:34.157 --> 11:36.359
I fought shoulder to shoulder
with David for six years.

11:36.393 --> 11:38.427
CALLEN: Okay, I'll ask
that question again.

11:38.462 --> 11:41.814
Are you aware
of the altercation?

11:41.849 --> 11:44.550
No.

11:44.585 --> 11:47.153
I have no knowledge
of any altercation.

11:47.187 --> 11:49.372
That's the truth?

11:49.406 --> 11:52.258
I thought SEALs
had integrity.

11:52.309 --> 11:54.844
G.

11:56.510 --> 11:58.995
I've lost seven men.

11:59.029 --> 12:01.464
Three maimed.

12:02.399 --> 12:04.684
One of my men is blind,

12:04.718 --> 12:09.706
trying to provide for two kids
by folding towels in a hotel.

12:09.740 --> 12:12.108
I'm sorry to hear that.

12:12.142 --> 12:15.228
I'm not sure
I understand your point.

12:15.262 --> 12:17.280
Makes it a little hard
to have to sit here

12:17.314 --> 12:19.598
and listen to you
question our integrity.

12:20.918 --> 12:23.119
You go to hell, Agent Callen.

12:23.153 --> 12:26.122
This conversation
is terminated.

12:27.374 --> 12:28.908
With all respect...

12:31.295 --> 12:33.946
...what happened
at the end of the film?

12:35.549 --> 12:38.034
You ever serve in the military,
Agent Callen?

12:40.704 --> 12:42.705
No.

12:46.626 --> 12:48.794
Bad guy fell in love
with the girl whose identity

12:48.812 --> 12:51.331
he stole.

12:51.398 --> 12:54.467
Had a change of heart.

12:57.521 --> 12:59.822
You didn't even ask a question.

13:01.608 --> 13:03.676
Are we gonna do this or not?

13:06.513 --> 13:08.982
I respect them.

13:09.016 --> 13:10.984
I honor them, Sam.

13:11.018 --> 13:13.020
But SEALs are not
beyond reproach.

13:13.054 --> 13:15.789
They won't talk to you.

13:17.292 --> 13:18.960
The questions themselves

13:18.994 --> 13:21.930
are an affront to them.

13:23.132 --> 13:25.801
But questions
from a fellow SEAL are not.

13:25.835 --> 13:27.969
(sighs)

13:29.939 --> 13:32.540
We need to clear them fast.

13:32.575 --> 13:34.175
If they don't talk to us,

13:34.209 --> 13:36.043
two innocent people
are gonna die.

13:37.546 --> 13:40.548
I need to do this alone.

13:40.582 --> 13:42.616
(door opens)

13:42.651 --> 13:46.186
You want Petty Officer Hodgkins
brought in?

13:46.220 --> 13:48.555
Let's let Sam have the room.

13:48.590 --> 13:51.125
Send him in.

13:52.527 --> 13:54.928
SAM: How long you been a SEAL?

13:54.963 --> 13:56.564
Seven years.

13:56.598 --> 13:59.534
Seen a lot?

13:59.568 --> 14:01.669
Enough.

14:02.738 --> 14:04.739
Too much?

14:04.774 --> 14:07.643
I don't believe so.

14:09.412 --> 14:12.313
I didn't think so, either.

14:12.347 --> 14:15.883
Until I got out.

14:18.920 --> 14:22.055
Your former girlfriend,

14:22.090 --> 14:25.992
Justine Samamara...

14:26.027 --> 14:28.161
she leave you?

14:29.263 --> 14:31.031
She wanted a family.

14:31.066 --> 14:33.200
I wasn't there.

14:33.268 --> 14:35.369
I was deployed ten months
of the year.

14:35.403 --> 14:37.071
Timing wasn't gonna work.

14:37.105 --> 14:39.607
You were angry?

14:42.344 --> 14:44.112
Sad.

14:44.147 --> 14:45.814
Not angry.

14:45.849 --> 14:47.616
I felt I owed more
to my country

14:47.651 --> 14:50.286
before I started
that part of my life.

14:52.055 --> 14:54.089
Then why'd you get
in a fight with Powell

14:54.123 --> 14:55.924
when he started dating her?

14:57.893 --> 15:01.062
Powell was...

15:01.096 --> 15:03.196
a jerk.

15:03.231 --> 15:05.765
I saw him chatting up
another girl at the bar.

15:05.800 --> 15:07.267
I told him not to hurt Justine.

15:07.301 --> 15:10.603
We had words,
pushed each other,

15:10.637 --> 15:12.939
that was it.

15:12.973 --> 15:15.108
That was it?

15:18.846 --> 15:20.946
That was it.

15:22.649 --> 15:24.483
What's so urgent?

15:24.518 --> 15:26.452
ERIC:
According to the security tapes,

15:26.487 --> 15:30.623
Ensign Powell left
the training base at 1608

15:30.658 --> 15:32.158
yesterday afternoon,

15:32.192 --> 15:34.026
and returned 1640.

15:34.061 --> 15:35.795
CALLEN:
That's a quick trip.

15:35.829 --> 15:39.031
We picked up his car parked
outside a strip mall in Cyprus.

15:39.066 --> 15:41.534
This is Powell heading
into the mailbox store.

15:41.568 --> 15:44.103
He's accessing a mailbox

15:44.137 --> 15:46.639
that he's been renting
for the last four months.

15:46.673 --> 15:48.574
He's an envelope
<i>into</i> his mailbox?

15:48.609 --> 15:50.376
You don't put mail into those.

15:50.410 --> 15:51.844
No, you rent them
to receive mail.

15:51.879 --> 15:55.248
Ten minutes ago,
we saw this.

15:55.283 --> 15:57.017
It's a dead drop.

15:57.051 --> 15:58.652
Well, if Powell
is dealing drugs,

15:58.686 --> 16:00.153
could be how
he's making his buy.

16:00.187 --> 16:02.122
If that's what this
is all about.

16:02.156 --> 16:04.391
We've pulled the license
on their car.

16:04.425 --> 16:07.027
Address is on your phones.

16:17.105 --> 16:18.372
That's the license.

16:18.406 --> 16:19.506
They're home.

16:19.540 --> 16:22.009
Deeks, take the back;
Kensi come with me.

16:42.062 --> 16:44.230
Federal agents!
Please open the door!

16:44.265 --> 16:45.732
(gunshots)

16:51.239 --> 16:53.140
(gunshots continue)

16:57.011 --> 16:58.512
Hey!

16:58.913 --> 17:00.281
(groans)

17:06.689 --> 17:08.757
One...

17:08.790 --> 17:09.758
two...

17:09.791 --> 17:11.358
three.

17:13.628 --> 17:15.730
Kensi.

17:23.005 --> 17:24.439
DEEKS: Garage.

17:24.473 --> 17:26.840
KENSI: Let's go.

17:37.621 --> 17:39.521
(car starting)

18:02.699 --> 18:03.866
CALLEN: Got an ID, Eric?

18:03.867 --> 18:06.402
The IDs indicated they
were Mexican nationals,

18:06.436 --> 18:07.812
but they were fakes.

18:07.813 --> 18:08.880
Keep looking.

18:08.915 --> 18:10.648
Also, Ensign Powell
had an account

18:10.683 --> 18:13.818
and a safety deposit box
at a bank in Cerritos.

18:13.852 --> 18:16.153
Only $300 in the account.

18:16.187 --> 18:17.421
Get a warrant

18:17.455 --> 18:19.823
and get that safety deposit
box opened, Miss Jones.

18:20.441 --> 18:21.508
Right.

18:21.542 --> 18:23.076
What about Sam's knife guy?

18:23.111 --> 18:24.578
Uh, I gave him the info,

18:24.612 --> 18:27.180
but he only wants
to talk to Sam.

18:27.215 --> 18:29.649
(sighs) Okay.

18:31.652 --> 18:32.852
I understand.

18:32.887 --> 18:34.921
It's printing out now.

18:34.955 --> 18:36.423
All right.

18:39.194 --> 18:41.262
Olmos made ten karambit
knives like this.

18:41.296 --> 18:44.432
One was sold to a member
of Green's SEAL team.

18:44.466 --> 18:48.069
It matches the wound's
dimensions exactly.

18:48.104 --> 18:50.038
I'll have MPs search
the grounds.

18:50.073 --> 18:52.341
None of the SEAL team
have left the base

18:52.375 --> 18:53.543
since Powell was killed.

18:53.577 --> 18:55.311
There's a good chance
th knife's still here.

18:55.345 --> 18:57.313
Who did he make it for?

18:57.347 --> 19:00.083
Petty Officer Doug Foster.

19:00.117 --> 19:03.352
Yes, sir, did my training
at Dam Neck.

19:03.387 --> 19:05.654
With Lieutenant Henry Carr.

19:05.688 --> 19:09.390
Yes. He spoke of you
on several occasions.

19:09.425 --> 19:11.392
He's a good teacher.

19:11.427 --> 19:13.427
Lieutenant Carr
said you were a man

19:13.461 --> 19:15.496
who we should
aspire to emulate.

19:15.530 --> 19:16.964
Hmm.

19:18.033 --> 19:21.069
Lieutenant Carr
is also a good man.

19:21.103 --> 19:24.440
It's like we're making him
interrogate his family.

19:24.474 --> 19:26.008
We are.

19:26.042 --> 19:29.645
SAM: Do you own a combat
knife called a karambit?

19:29.680 --> 19:32.015
I used to.

19:32.049 --> 19:34.551
I lost it clearing house
in Kandahar.

19:34.585 --> 19:38.020
We believe Ensign Powell was
killed with a karambit knife.

19:38.055 --> 19:42.724
That's a common knife
among military personnel.

19:46.128 --> 19:48.930
Well, thank you for your time,
PO Foster.

19:48.964 --> 19:50.798
Sure.

19:50.832 --> 19:52.533
Appreciate it.

19:52.567 --> 19:54.067
My pleasure.

19:54.102 --> 19:55.101
Oh,

19:55.136 --> 19:57.003
go to the movies last night?

19:57.038 --> 19:59.139
Yes, sir.

19:59.173 --> 20:00.507
What happened
at the end of the movie?

20:00.541 --> 20:05.913
This, um, this guy was
stealing a female's identity.

20:05.948 --> 20:07.915
Started to like the female.

20:07.949 --> 20:11.685
He had, uh, a change
of heart, I guess.

20:13.588 --> 20:15.723
Okay.

20:15.757 --> 20:17.191
Thanks.

20:19.627 --> 20:21.695
Find me somebody that saw them
at the movie last night.

20:21.729 --> 20:23.863
Okay.

20:26.100 --> 20:27.400
(door opens)

20:30.637 --> 20:33.205
KENSI:
Callen, this is Heather Linden.

20:33.240 --> 20:35.708
She worked the candy counter
last night.

20:35.742 --> 20:37.542
DEEKS: She's a consummate
professional who agrees with me

20:37.577 --> 20:38.810
that Sour Patch Kids

20:38.845 --> 20:40.879
are indeed
the best movie candy, too.

20:41.748 --> 20:42.915
Hi.

20:42.949 --> 20:44.269
Heather saw

20:44.270 --> 20:46.504
Green's SEAL team at the
theater last night.

20:46.539 --> 20:47.672
Are they in trouble?

20:47.707 --> 20:49.642
Well, we're trying to make sure
that they're not.

20:49.676 --> 20:52.211
You're sure you saw
all of them last night?

20:52.246 --> 20:56.082
Yeah, they were flirting
with a bunch of us.

20:56.117 --> 20:58.752
And did you see them
after the show as well?

20:58.786 --> 21:01.688
They tried to get us
to go with them and party.

21:01.722 --> 21:03.990
You didn't want to
take them up on that?

21:04.025 --> 21:05.292
Kind of handsome.

21:05.326 --> 21:06.460
A little old.

21:06.494 --> 21:07.728
Ouch.

21:07.762 --> 21:10.564
A couple of them
had wedding bands.

21:10.598 --> 21:13.767
I really think they were
just fooling around.

21:13.801 --> 21:16.136
You really don't have
good judgment, do you?

21:17.471 --> 21:21.876
Everyone knows that Junior Mints
are the best movie candy.

21:22.744 --> 21:25.112
SAM: <i>What'd she say?</i>

21:25.147 --> 21:27.582
They were there before
and after the show.

21:27.616 --> 21:29.417
She says they were
flirting with her.

21:29.451 --> 21:31.586
So, his story checks out.
Sam,

21:31.620 --> 21:32.920
three of these guys are married.

21:32.955 --> 21:34.589
Just doesn't sound like
the guys we've been talking to.

21:34.623 --> 21:35.757
DEEKS: We also
checked the theater.

21:35.791 --> 21:37.259
There's six exits,
four more in the lobby.

21:37.293 --> 21:39.828
I mean, these guys are trained
to get in and out of countries.

21:39.862 --> 21:42.631
Getting out of there undetected
after lights go down,

21:42.666 --> 21:43.966
that'd be easy.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.335
Now, flirting with the girls
assures them of being noticed.

21:46.370 --> 21:47.570
They got an alibi.

21:47.604 --> 21:49.638
Going in and out of a
movie theater is one thing,

21:49.672 --> 21:51.974
but how do you explain them
getting back on to the base

21:52.008 --> 21:53.275
without going
through security?

21:53.310 --> 21:55.645
Come on, Sam, they're SEALs.

21:57.581 --> 22:00.883
Let's start with
the perimeter fence.

22:02.786 --> 22:05.154
I'll check it out.

22:11.628 --> 22:13.862
ERIC:
Okay, drive another 20 feet.

22:13.897 --> 22:16.966
Okay, stop.
All right, stop right there.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.569
Directly in front of you,
there's a 14-foor corridor.

22:19.603 --> 22:22.505
It's not monitored by
any of the base's cameras.

22:22.539 --> 22:24.540
This is where they'd enter.

22:24.574 --> 22:27.176
It's also a single-layer fence.

22:27.210 --> 22:28.945
NELL: Yeah, it's scheduled
to be doubled,

22:28.979 --> 22:31.414
but the work order
hasn't been completed.

22:37.421 --> 22:39.356
(sighs)

22:39.390 --> 22:41.291
Who's going to tell Sam?

22:41.326 --> 22:44.595
I will.

22:49.333 --> 22:50.934
The fence was cut.

22:52.803 --> 22:54.971
New, no corrosion.

22:56.940 --> 22:59.743
We know the weapon they had,
we know they had access,

22:59.777 --> 23:01.945
and it appears
they worked as a team.

23:01.980 --> 23:03.680
Everything is circumstantial.

23:03.715 --> 23:06.583
You want to stop their mission
with no physical evidence?

23:06.617 --> 23:08.118
What's the motive?

23:08.152 --> 23:10.421
Getting with another guy's girl.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.558
But units have strict
codes about that.

23:13.592 --> 23:15.260
Not the SEALs.

23:15.294 --> 23:17.662
That story doesn't hold water,
and you know it.

23:17.696 --> 23:20.231
Regular military kill
for jealousy, maybe.

23:20.266 --> 23:21.399
Not these men.

23:21.434 --> 23:23.969
Sam... these guys did it.

23:24.637 --> 23:25.938
(door opens)

23:25.972 --> 23:27.105
I'm sorry, guys.

23:27.140 --> 23:29.274
Hetty wants
to conference.

23:30.877 --> 23:34.079
I have some disturbing news.

23:34.113 --> 23:36.348
The two men who met

23:36.382 --> 23:39.251
with Ensign Powell
worked for the I.S.I.,

23:39.286 --> 23:42.154
the Pakistani
intelligence agency.

23:42.188 --> 23:46.125
We also got access
to Powell's safety-deposit box.

23:46.160 --> 23:48.294
There were four envelopes,

23:48.329 --> 23:51.030
each containing $12,000 in cash.

23:51.065 --> 23:53.833
So, Powell was selling
information to Pakistan.

23:53.868 --> 23:55.969
You were right.

23:56.003 --> 23:59.472
SEALs don't kill for jealousy.

24:00.562 --> 24:02.863
But they would kill a traitor.

24:15.561 --> 24:18.162
The window is closing
on the lives of the hostages.

24:18.197 --> 24:19.430
Once they're moved,
in all likelihood,

24:19.464 --> 24:21.132
we're not gonna get
another shot at them.

24:21.166 --> 24:22.367
Two hours and 15 minutes.

24:22.401 --> 24:23.901
We're well aware
of the clock, Commander.

24:23.936 --> 24:25.270
Then you're releasing my team?

24:25.305 --> 24:27.239
Ensign Powell
was selling intelligence,

24:27.273 --> 24:30.775
most likely about your SEALs,
to I.S.I. agents

24:30.810 --> 24:31.910
in Los Angeles.

24:31.945 --> 24:33.178
You're sure?

24:33.213 --> 24:34.379
Yes.

24:34.414 --> 24:35.981
Then you need to turn over

24:36.015 --> 24:38.183
everything you know
about the breach in security.

24:38.218 --> 24:39.451
We will.

24:39.485 --> 24:41.086
And release my team.

24:41.120 --> 24:42.254
We can't do that, sir.

24:42.289 --> 24:44.489
If this mission
has been compromised,

24:44.524 --> 24:46.925
it's D.O.D.'s and my call
whether to continue.

24:46.960 --> 24:48.460
Your men are being held
as suspects

24:48.495 --> 24:49.628
in the death of Ensign Powell.

24:49.663 --> 24:51.864
What are you trying to do here,
<i>Agent</i> Hanna?

24:51.898 --> 24:53.632
They will be arrested
and taken into custody.

24:53.667 --> 24:55.067
Then understand this.

24:55.101 --> 24:57.403
The lives of two Americans
are on your head.

24:57.437 --> 24:59.805
I am well aware
of the consequences, Commander.

24:59.839 --> 25:01.473
(door opens)
DEEKS: Sam?

25:01.507 --> 25:04.143
Petty Officer Foster wants
to talk to you.

25:04.177 --> 25:06.545
He says it's urgent.

25:06.580 --> 25:08.714
You got something
to tell me?

25:08.749 --> 25:11.250
I want to make
a confession.

25:11.285 --> 25:14.821
I received intel reports
there was chatter among

25:14.856 --> 25:16.590
Taliban officials which
indicated knowledge

25:16.624 --> 25:17.991
of my team's deployment.

25:18.026 --> 25:20.695
I knew that the only person down
the chain of command

25:20.729 --> 25:22.630
with access to this information
was Ensign Powell.

25:22.664 --> 25:24.199
I know what
you're doing.

25:24.233 --> 25:25.600
Don't do it.

25:25.635 --> 25:27.502
I followed Powell.

25:27.537 --> 25:30.005
Saw him meet with two men
and receive an envelope.

25:30.040 --> 25:31.340
Then, last night...

25:31.375 --> 25:33.009
You left the movie theater
by yourself?

25:33.043 --> 25:35.679
Told my team I wasn't feeling
well and stepped out.

25:35.713 --> 25:39.483
I returned to base
through the fence.

25:39.517 --> 25:41.585
I confronted Powell,
he drew a weapon,

25:41.620 --> 25:43.420
we fought, and I stabbed him.

25:43.455 --> 25:45.323
The wound was not critical.

25:45.357 --> 25:48.326
I dressed it,
I searched his room,

25:48.360 --> 25:50.395
found a large sum of cash
in his footlocker,

25:50.429 --> 25:52.697
confirming he was the individual
selling classified information.

25:52.731 --> 25:54.665
It was then I realized
he was not breathing.

25:54.700 --> 25:56.400
I performed CPR,
but he did not respond.

25:56.435 --> 25:58.435
So, you let him bleed out?

25:58.470 --> 26:01.772
I don't know. I...

26:01.806 --> 26:04.007
I don't believe so.

26:04.041 --> 26:06.442
I was... I was just

26:06.476 --> 26:07.776
going to question Powell,

26:07.810 --> 26:09.878
and find out what other intel
he had revealed,

26:09.912 --> 26:12.180
detain him 48 hours until
after the mission was completed.

26:12.214 --> 26:14.983
But you didn't get him any
medical attention, and he died.

26:15.017 --> 26:16.984
I'm trained in combat medicine.

26:17.019 --> 26:18.953
I did not believe
his wound was critical.

26:18.987 --> 26:21.890
Then you moved him to the
impact zone... by yourself?

26:21.924 --> 26:23.591
- I acted alone.
- No!

26:23.626 --> 26:24.726
I'm not buying it.

26:24.760 --> 26:25.827
I acted alone.

26:25.861 --> 26:27.295
You were part of a team.

26:27.330 --> 26:29.764
You all went to the movies,
you all made up the alibi,

26:29.799 --> 26:31.066
and you all came back
to the base.

26:31.100 --> 26:33.001
My team had no knowledge
of my action

26:33.035 --> 26:35.337
either before, during or after
I killed Ensign Powell.

26:35.371 --> 26:36.571
Listen to me.

26:36.605 --> 26:39.574
You're giving up everything

26:39.609 --> 26:42.978
for men who had
a part in this.

26:43.012 --> 26:44.613
Your career is over.

26:44.647 --> 26:46.281
You're going to prison.

26:46.315 --> 26:48.149
Negligent homicide!

26:48.184 --> 26:51.786
By confessing my crime,
I am protecting the mission.

26:54.256 --> 26:56.190
(sighs)

26:56.224 --> 26:58.558
I am a Navy SEAL.

26:58.593 --> 27:01.294
It's what we do.

27:06.368 --> 27:08.135
(beeping)

27:08.170 --> 27:10.371
Hey, Kaleidoscope just got a hit

27:10.405 --> 27:13.709
on the wounded
I.S.I. agent's car.

27:13.743 --> 27:16.245
It's parked at a
motel in Compton.

27:16.279 --> 27:18.881
Notify Kensi and Deeks.

27:18.915 --> 27:20.950
Yeah. Eric, we got it.

27:20.984 --> 27:22.718
Chief Green told me
Foster confessed.

27:22.753 --> 27:24.253
You have your suspect.
This is over.

27:24.288 --> 27:26.189
He's taking the fall for them.

27:26.223 --> 27:27.991
What about the mission?

27:28.025 --> 27:31.595
We came here for the truth,
Commander, not a scapegoat.

27:31.629 --> 27:33.797
I'll get Hetty.

27:36.701 --> 27:39.536
Wait.

27:39.570 --> 27:41.805
(door closes)

27:47.246 --> 27:50.048
I'm waiting.

27:52.352 --> 27:54.286
I got something.

27:54.320 --> 27:56.121
But I got to do it alone.

27:56.155 --> 27:58.157
You can't be a part of it.

28:01.128 --> 28:03.229
Please.

28:04.764 --> 28:06.799
Okay.

28:07.700 --> 28:10.502
Bring them all in the room.

28:10.537 --> 28:11.670
(door bursts open)

28:15.709 --> 28:17.042
Clear.

28:17.077 --> 28:18.644
Clear.

28:18.678 --> 28:20.079
KENSI: Deeks?

28:20.113 --> 28:22.548
DEEKS: Yeah?

28:22.582 --> 28:24.883
I've got a laptop.

28:25.784 --> 28:27.819
(sighs)

28:27.853 --> 28:29.153
Thanks.

28:29.188 --> 28:30.354
Eric, he left his laptop.

28:30.389 --> 28:31.756
Looks like he wiped it clean.

28:31.790 --> 28:33.191
We'll get it back to you.

28:33.225 --> 28:35.293
KENSI: Funny, there was
no Internet in the room.

28:35.327 --> 28:37.595
He needs
to use a secure connection

28:37.629 --> 28:40.098
in order
to send the intelligence.

28:40.132 --> 28:40.998
DEEKS: Why?

28:41.033 --> 28:42.667
NELL:
Because Pakistan is our ally.

28:42.701 --> 28:43.968
They supposedly

28:44.002 --> 28:46.237
don't have any agents
operating in the United States.

28:46.271 --> 28:48.973
Just like we supposedly
don't have any agents

28:49.007 --> 28:50.808
operating in Pakistan.

28:50.842 --> 28:53.044
As I said,
a secure connection.

28:53.078 --> 28:54.879
Can never trace
it back to him.

28:54.913 --> 28:56.580
ERIC:
Okay, so, scanning the area,

28:56.615 --> 28:57.848
I got a business

28:57.882 --> 28:59.383
that's been red-flagged
by Homeland Security.

28:59.417 --> 29:01.952
It's a Pakistan
communications company

29:01.987 --> 29:04.021
with secure satellite access.

29:04.055 --> 29:05.489
Sending you the address now.

29:05.523 --> 29:07.624
On it.

29:30.547 --> 29:32.648
(sighs)

29:37.553 --> 29:39.988
You all left the movie theater,

29:40.022 --> 29:43.057
cut the fence,

29:43.060 --> 29:45.228
reentered the base.

29:46.027 --> 29:49.462
You restrained, questioned
and killed Ensign Powell.

29:50.698 --> 29:53.499
Then disposed of his body
in the impact zone.

29:56.903 --> 29:58.804
Petty Officer Torres,

29:58.839 --> 30:00.740
how'd that movie end?

30:02.777 --> 30:04.978
This guy was
stealing identities,

30:05.013 --> 30:07.715
and then in the end,
he fell for the girl,

30:07.749 --> 30:10.651
tried to get with
her, and he had a...

30:10.686 --> 30:12.987
change of heart.
Change of heart. Yeah.

30:13.022 --> 30:14.556
(scoffs)

30:14.590 --> 30:17.626
You men seem
to have your story together.

30:17.660 --> 30:19.227
Two people are
about to die.

30:19.262 --> 30:21.529
You have a confession!

30:24.566 --> 30:25.733
MPs found it

30:25.767 --> 30:27.368
a half hour ago.

30:27.402 --> 30:29.002
That's not my knife.

30:29.037 --> 30:30.804
How do you know
without looking at it?

30:30.838 --> 30:33.806
I told you, I lost it
clearing a house in Kandahar.

30:33.841 --> 30:36.175
But you confessed that
you used it on Ensign Powell.

30:36.210 --> 30:38.811
That was a different knife.

30:38.845 --> 30:42.548
Oh. So now we have two knives?

30:42.583 --> 30:45.552
Whose fingerprints
are going to be on this

30:45.586 --> 30:47.721
if it's not your knife?
I... have a...

30:47.755 --> 30:48.889
Stop talking.

30:48.923 --> 30:50.791
It's a duplicate knife.

30:50.826 --> 30:52.860
It's too late!

30:52.895 --> 30:55.196
Story's falling apart,
gentlemen.

30:55.230 --> 30:57.532
It's over!

30:57.566 --> 30:58.933
You happy?

30:58.968 --> 31:00.835
No.

31:00.870 --> 31:02.937
Because to me,

31:02.971 --> 31:08.708
being a SEAL means
honor and integrity.

31:08.743 --> 31:10.877
It means something.

31:12.980 --> 31:17.082
We would never shame ourselves
by compromising the truth.

31:23.956 --> 31:27.559
You want it?

31:27.593 --> 31:29.995
Really?

31:30.029 --> 31:32.564
That's why I'm here.

31:32.598 --> 31:35.367
SEAL to SEAL.

31:43.843 --> 31:46.545
(static crackles)

31:46.579 --> 31:49.915
Agent Callen,

31:49.949 --> 31:53.185
I hope your partner knows
what he's doing.

31:56.389 --> 31:59.391
He's doing what he has to do.

32:18.380 --> 32:20.481
No cameras.

32:21.713 --> 32:23.914
No one hears what's
said in this room.

32:25.830 --> 32:28.040
SEAL to SEAL.

32:28.043 --> 32:32.247
Someone turns against you
on the battlefield,

32:32.282 --> 32:34.082
you kill him.

32:34.117 --> 32:36.618
Might even get
a medal for it.

32:36.653 --> 32:39.454
But now it's in your backyard,
and suddenly, it's unpalatable.

32:39.489 --> 32:41.624
You could have turned him in.

32:41.658 --> 32:43.559
We were going to.

32:43.593 --> 32:46.262
After the mission
had been completed.

32:46.296 --> 32:48.097
If we revealed
the breach in security,

32:48.131 --> 32:49.499
the mission could have
been terminated.

32:49.533 --> 32:52.535
They are going
to behead that woman.

32:52.569 --> 32:54.804
You know that.

32:54.838 --> 32:56.806
GREEN: Mark Rowe.

32:56.840 --> 32:58.808
Former SEAL.

32:58.842 --> 33:00.777
I served two years with him.

33:00.812 --> 33:02.246
He has a wife
and a child,

33:02.280 --> 33:04.181
and even with that,
Mark would have died for me.

33:04.216 --> 33:06.451
We had our mission.

33:06.485 --> 33:08.286
Powell was the enemy.

33:08.321 --> 33:09.821
The choice was clear.

33:09.856 --> 33:11.156
To kill him.

33:11.191 --> 33:12.658
No, absolutely not.

33:12.692 --> 33:15.261
Everything that Petty Officer
Foster told you was the truth.

33:15.295 --> 33:16.829
We entered his room.

33:16.863 --> 33:19.097
Powell wasn't there;
we split up to search for him.

33:19.132 --> 33:21.299
I found him outside smoking.

33:21.333 --> 33:22.834
Powell knew it was over.

33:22.868 --> 33:24.802
He drew his sidearm.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.570
We struggled.

33:26.605 --> 33:28.472
I stabbed him.

33:28.506 --> 33:30.441
It was in self-defense.

33:30.475 --> 33:32.242
HODGKINS:
The wound was not critical.

33:32.277 --> 33:34.812
We gave him medical attention
and searched his room.

33:34.846 --> 33:37.048
Then he stopped breathing.

33:38.650 --> 33:40.685
All on his own?

33:40.719 --> 33:43.521
As far as we could determine,

33:43.555 --> 33:45.724
yes.

33:48.828 --> 33:51.130
And none of you felt any malice

33:51.164 --> 33:54.134
or vengeance for a man who put
the entire team in danger.

33:54.168 --> 33:56.302
Hm?

33:58.105 --> 34:03.609
Betraying his country
for money?

34:03.644 --> 34:05.778
It was all for the mission?

34:08.081 --> 34:12.016
What's in your heart when you
confront the enemy, Chief Hanna?

34:14.569 --> 34:16.036
(car doors slam shut)

34:18.540 --> 34:20.007
This is it.

34:20.041 --> 34:21.274
Back door's open.

34:21.309 --> 34:22.676
Eric, you sure he's in there?

34:22.710 --> 34:25.178
NELL: Zoom in.

34:25.213 --> 34:27.347
Yeah, it looks like he went in
five minutes ago.

34:27.382 --> 34:28.649
He's there.

34:28.683 --> 34:33.188
HETTY: Detective, that
transmission cannot be uploaded.

34:42.766 --> 34:43.766
(door closes)

34:43.801 --> 34:44.667
(sighs)

34:44.702 --> 34:46.636
We're a go/no-go,
Agent Hanna.

34:46.670 --> 34:48.905
Either they leave now,
or the mission is aborted.

34:48.940 --> 34:50.373
You have your confession.

34:50.408 --> 34:52.743
Our team has eyes
on the I.S.I. agent.

34:52.777 --> 34:53.976
This mission's
been compromised.

34:54.012 --> 34:56.480
You really gonna
send your guys in there?

35:21.372 --> 35:22.539
KENSI: Federal agents!
DEEKS: Don't move!

35:22.573 --> 35:24.674
(gunshots)

35:35.620 --> 35:37.087
(beeping)

35:38.556 --> 35:39.656
Eric,

35:39.690 --> 35:40.824
it's uploading.

35:40.858 --> 35:43.192
ERIC:
I don't think I can stop it.

35:43.227 --> 35:44.494
(gunshots)

35:45.562 --> 35:46.695
(electrical hissing)

35:48.164 --> 35:50.198
It's okay. I got it.

35:50.232 --> 35:51.399
Subtle.

35:51.433 --> 35:53.401
(gunshot)

35:53.436 --> 35:54.636
Eric, any of that come through?

35:54.671 --> 35:56.338
I don't know.

35:56.372 --> 35:57.639
It was a secure connection.

35:57.674 --> 35:59.742
(computer beeping)
Mr. Callen?

35:59.776 --> 36:01.043
The transmission
was terminated.

36:01.077 --> 36:05.382
We don't know if any information
was uploaded.

36:05.416 --> 36:07.584
Okay.

36:07.619 --> 36:09.086
Transmission was stopped,

36:09.121 --> 36:10.755
but we don't know
if it got through.

36:10.789 --> 36:11.989
It doesn't matter.

36:12.024 --> 36:13.358
We're going anyway.

36:13.392 --> 36:15.160
What's it gonna be?

36:15.194 --> 36:17.595
Are my men getting
on that plane?

36:20.500 --> 36:22.667
Sam.

36:24.604 --> 36:26.705
(sighs)

36:34.414 --> 36:36.916
Finding no physical evidence,

36:36.950 --> 36:38.884
I have no suspects
at this time

36:38.919 --> 36:40.586
in the death of
Ensign Powell.

36:40.620 --> 36:43.589
Put your team on a plane.

36:43.624 --> 36:46.125
Including Petty Officer Foster.

36:49.328 --> 36:51.029
That plane better
be fueled and ready.

36:51.063 --> 36:53.198
Wheels up in ten.

36:56.068 --> 36:57.935
You director aware
of your findings?

36:57.969 --> 37:00.404
Get your men on the plane.

37:00.438 --> 37:02.139
Quickly.

37:07.111 --> 37:09.111
This could cost you everything.

37:09.145 --> 37:11.280
Right.

37:12.749 --> 37:15.384
Let's get out of here.

37:16.787 --> 37:19.289
(sighs)

37:20.425 --> 37:22.059
Chief Green?

37:23.996 --> 37:26.097
Bring them home.

37:26.131 --> 37:28.300
We'll do our best.

37:44.183 --> 37:46.218
KENSI: Hey.
Hey.

37:46.252 --> 37:48.520
So...

37:48.554 --> 37:51.556
publicly the Pakistan government
is denying any involvement.

37:51.591 --> 37:54.259
DEEKS: They are claiming
that their former agents

37:54.293 --> 37:55.593
had gone rogue.

37:55.628 --> 37:57.728
(phone ringing)

37:59.665 --> 38:01.967
Yeah?

38:02.001 --> 38:04.136
HETTY: My office, Mr. Hanna.

38:17.050 --> 38:21.121
You made a huge decision
without my authority.

38:21.155 --> 38:23.790
I did what I had to do.

38:25.325 --> 38:27.727
How do we proceed from here?

38:27.761 --> 38:31.029
I believe there's
not enough evidence

38:31.063 --> 38:33.131
to proceed at this time.

38:33.165 --> 38:36.334
What about Petty Officer
Foster's confession?

38:38.271 --> 38:42.207
The recording system
malfunctioned.

38:42.242 --> 38:46.178
There's no record
of a confession.

38:46.212 --> 38:50.716
Petty Officer Foster has nothing
else to say at this time.

38:53.853 --> 38:58.357
I cannot allow those men
to walk away.

38:58.392 --> 39:00.360
No.

39:00.394 --> 39:03.697
You cannot.

39:05.032 --> 39:07.367
I understand what
you have to do.

39:07.401 --> 39:09.936
Hey, satellite's up,
feed is live.

39:22.017 --> 39:24.218
(gunfire and explosions on feed)

39:24.252 --> 39:27.422
SEAL: All team members,
contact left, contact left!

39:30.426 --> 39:32.761
(automatic weapons firing)

39:32.795 --> 39:35.330
HODGKINS: I'm hit! I'm hit!

39:35.364 --> 39:36.932
I think that's Hodgkins.

39:36.966 --> 39:39.000
I can't walk! I can't walk!

39:39.035 --> 39:41.136
Go! Go!

39:42.772 --> 39:44.506
SEAL:
Does anyone have eyes on Two?

39:44.540 --> 39:46.007
(sighs)

39:46.042 --> 39:48.410
I say again:
Does anyone have eyes on Two?

39:48.444 --> 39:50.078
It's not a game.

39:50.113 --> 39:52.314
SEAL:
Three Platoon, Three Platoon.

39:53.416 --> 39:55.583
No, it's not.

39:56.919 --> 39:58.219
SEAL: Contact. Contact.

39:58.254 --> 40:00.388
(gunfire continues)

40:01.257 --> 40:02.857
Powell was an asthmatic.

40:02.891 --> 40:04.526
His mouth was taped.

40:04.560 --> 40:05.527
He was stressed.

40:05.561 --> 40:06.761
He probably had an attack.

40:06.795 --> 40:09.530
The wound didn't kill him.

40:09.564 --> 40:12.367
Autopsy just came
in, confirmed it.

40:12.401 --> 40:14.402
Agent Hanna didn't know this.

40:14.436 --> 40:15.870
But that's just the thing.

40:15.904 --> 40:17.604
He did, Hetty.

40:17.638 --> 40:20.773
He knew the character
of those men.

40:20.808 --> 40:23.276
We're not judge and jury.

40:23.310 --> 40:27.046
He allowed suspects
in a murder case to walk.

40:27.081 --> 40:28.848
He destroyed evidence.

40:28.882 --> 40:31.017
Yes, he did.

40:31.051 --> 40:33.586
Sam would die for what's right.

40:33.620 --> 40:37.623
He may have just done that,
Mr. Callen.

40:40.426 --> 40:41.960
(gunfire continues on live feed)

40:41.994 --> 40:44.362
SEAL: Forward fire
from all directions.

40:45.897 --> 40:47.832
SEAL 2: 31, I need a sitrep.

40:47.866 --> 40:49.300
SEAL 3: Two's down! Two's down!

40:49.334 --> 40:51.635
I need evac.

40:51.670 --> 40:52.770
(gunfire)

40:52.804 --> 40:54.472
SEAL 2: Requesting medevac.

40:54.506 --> 40:56.341
What's happening?

40:56.375 --> 40:58.543
Hodgkins can't walk.

40:58.578 --> 40:59.845
I do not have eyes
on the packages.

40:59.879 --> 41:02.814
I say again, I do not have
eyes on the packages.

41:02.849 --> 41:04.216
FOSTER: I'm hit! I'm hit!

41:04.251 --> 41:05.785
That's Foster.

41:05.819 --> 41:07.754
SEAL 1: Foster's down.

41:07.788 --> 41:12.225
SEAL 2: Sergeant One,
I need a sitrep now.

41:12.260 --> 41:13.493
SEAL 3: Ambush! Ambush!

41:13.527 --> 41:16.162
We don't know
if the transmission got through.

41:16.196 --> 41:18.164
They may be compromised.

41:18.198 --> 41:21.299
Taliban knew they were coming.

41:21.333 --> 41:23.935
SEAL: ...on Five and Six...
(indistinct)

41:23.969 --> 41:27.071
All team on deck.
All team on deck.

41:27.105 --> 41:28.105
You copy? Over.

41:28.139 --> 41:30.140
Do you read me? Over.

41:30.175 --> 41:32.309
(static crackling)

41:34.679 --> 41:36.680
(sighs heavily)

41:36.714 --> 41:37.948
SEAL: Targets acquired.

41:37.982 --> 41:39.349
Look.

41:39.383 --> 41:41.051
Right there,
that's Green.

41:41.085 --> 41:42.719
That's Rowe.

41:42.753 --> 41:44.488
And that's
Loretta Davis.

41:47.559 --> 41:50.828
Evac'ing two W.I.A.

41:53.098 --> 41:55.066
Cobra One, copy.

41:55.100 --> 41:57.569
Angel One, copy.

41:57.603 --> 42:00.071
That could have been a trap.

42:00.105 --> 42:03.241
But those men went anyway.

42:04.109 --> 42:06.944
That's what we do.

42:12.952 --> 42:15.087
Mr. Hanna.

42:25.933 --> 42:28.701
I've decided to follow
your recommendation

42:28.736 --> 42:31.438
and close the investigation.

42:33.340 --> 42:35.842
I'll take care of this.

42:35.876 --> 42:38.044
Thank you.

42:38.078 --> 42:40.813
No, Mr. Hanna.

42:43.550 --> 42:46.218
Thank you.
