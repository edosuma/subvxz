WEBVTT

00:03.543 --> 00:06.929
Oh, babe, Caroline and Tim
say that we're gonna meet

00:06.980 --> 00:08.714
at the strip mall
in Chinatown at 9:00,

00:08.732 --> 00:10.933
and then we're gonna
take a Metro to a field.

00:10.984 --> 00:12.434
I'm actually
really interested

00:12.485 --> 00:14.153
in trying out
this whole dubstep thing.

00:14.187 --> 00:15.154
I feel like this
is the kind of thing

00:15.188 --> 00:16.722
that we're gonna
be totally into.

00:16.740 --> 00:17.889
I'm digging this.

00:17.907 --> 00:19.658
It's like
a musical nightmare.

00:19.693 --> 00:21.026
Yeah, but in a great way.

00:21.060 --> 00:23.078
- Tim said that the...

00:23.113 --> 00:25.614
that the peak of it is when
"the drop" hits, I guess.

00:25.649 --> 00:27.766
It's like a musical crescendo
or something.

00:27.784 --> 00:29.618
S, like in, um...

00:29.653 --> 00:30.869
Like <i>in the air tonight,</i>

00:30.904 --> 00:32.655
when Phil Collins
comes in on the drums.

00:32.706 --> 00:34.907
Yeah, honey,
it's just like Phil Collins.

00:34.941 --> 00:39.277
This is so nice
to have young, hip friends.

00:39.295 --> 00:42.381
Just think, in an hour,
depending on subway traffic,

00:42.415 --> 00:44.249
we're gonna be
in the middle of a field.

00:44.283 --> 00:46.168
Yeah.
Pumping our fists.

00:46.219 --> 00:48.220
Yeah, lost in the music.

00:48.254 --> 00:50.956
Aggressive teenagers sweating
through their jumpsuits.

00:50.974 --> 00:52.958
Everybody's on drugs.

00:52.976 --> 00:55.427
The smell of mud
and field nachos.

00:55.461 --> 00:57.062
Do you want to bail
from this as badly as I do?

00:57.097 --> 00:58.313
Oh, my God, so much so.
Please.

00:58.348 --> 00:59.732
- I hate Tim and Caroline.
- They suck, seriously.

00:59.766 --> 01:02.134
It's like, have a kid.
It's not cute any more.

01:02.152 --> 01:03.602
We need new friends!

01:03.636 --> 01:04.903
All right, I'm gonna
cancel the babysitter,

01:04.938 --> 01:06.488
call Tim, say that we're sick.

01:06.523 --> 01:07.690
Why don't you cue up
<i>Downton Abbey</i> or something?

01:07.741 --> 01:09.692
Okay, turn off the music,
though!

01:09.743 --> 01:11.977
- I did.
- Oh, my God.

We need to all work together
to make our neighborhood safe.

01:33.433 --> 01:35.934
Last week, the Shaws
had their mailbox stolen.

01:35.969 --> 01:37.836
Ripped right off the post.

01:37.854 --> 01:40.022
And someone keyed a wiener
into Terry's car.

01:41.507 --> 01:45.277
I had to ask Gene about the
little dashes emanating from it.

01:45.311 --> 01:46.845
I did not like the answer.

01:47.593 --> 01:50.482
That's why we're organizing
nightly safety walks.

01:50.516 --> 01:52.818
Everyone sign up.
Have some coffee.

01:52.852 --> 01:57.039
And if you ask nicely enough,
Gene may bring out his guitar.

01:58.708 --> 02:01.359
How do we ask to ensure
Gene won't pull out his guitar?

02:02.629 --> 02:04.379
Oh, believe me,
he's gonna pull it out.

02:04.414 --> 02:05.864
There it is. Yeah.

02:05.882 --> 02:08.699
He does a reggae version
<i>you look wonderful tonight.</i>

02:08.717 --> 02:10.702
Then he stares at me directly.
He does not stare at you.

02:10.720 --> 02:12.137
He stares right into my eyes.

02:12.172 --> 02:14.539
I'm Justin.
This is Lawrence.

02:14.557 --> 02:16.258
Oh, hey, guys. Hi.
I'm Reagan, this is Chris.

02:16.309 --> 02:17.309
Hi. How are ya?

02:17.343 --> 02:18.977
You guys want
to have some coffee,

02:19.012 --> 02:21.713
and talk about the amount of
children's art on these walls?

02:23.049 --> 02:24.733
- It can't all
be frame-worthy.

02:24.768 --> 02:25.851
It's not.

02:25.885 --> 02:27.019
Okay, he's staring
right at me.

02:27.053 --> 02:28.020
No, he's really
not staring at you.

02:28.054 --> 02:29.221
Oh, no, he kinda is.

'Cause my fiancee dumped me
via Google chat

03:16.736 --> 03:18.403
while I was stationed
in Afghanistan.

03:18.437 --> 03:20.372
Thank you for your service.

03:20.406 --> 03:22.741
So, work is kind of
my deal right now, okay?

03:22.775 --> 03:25.327
I plan on being here
until at least 2300 hours.

03:25.378 --> 03:27.079
We get it.

03:27.113 --> 03:29.882
No one outworks me
on my own show.

03:29.916 --> 03:31.783
We're in for a long night.

03:31.801 --> 03:34.452
They're just like us,
you know, with the little kid,

03:34.470 --> 03:36.388
our age, our speed.

03:36.422 --> 03:37.923
Not to mention the gay thing.

03:37.957 --> 03:40.259
Oh, yeah, it's so cool.
Gay cachet.

03:40.293 --> 03:42.144
- Yeah.
- Whoa, wait a second, babe.

03:42.178 --> 03:43.896
Is that a thing?
I don't know.

03:43.930 --> 03:47.349
You know what, honey,
I'm gonna go out on a limb here,

03:47.400 --> 03:49.134
and I'm ready
to ask those gentlemen out.

03:49.152 --> 03:50.802
- Yeah, I... wait.
There they are.

03:50.820 --> 03:52.271
- They're... okay.
- Whoa, God, I'm so nervous.

03:52.305 --> 03:53.438
Don't be nervous.

03:53.472 --> 03:54.907
I want them to think
that I'm cool.

03:54.941 --> 03:55.908
- You're awesome. You did not.
- Yeah, I don't know.

03:55.942 --> 03:57.109
Is that a dong?

03:57.143 --> 03:58.243
- Hey. What is...
- What?

03:58.278 --> 04:00.162
- A dong?
- That's a dong!

04:00.196 --> 04:02.614
Yeah, they gotta buff out
a dong. That's the craziest...

04:02.648 --> 04:04.283
You guys want to go bowling?

04:04.317 --> 04:05.500
Whenever? Sometime?

04:05.535 --> 04:06.835
Okay, okay,
what part of "be cool"

04:06.870 --> 04:07.953
did you not understand?

04:07.987 --> 04:08.954
I'm so sorry.
Rub it in. Rub it in.

04:08.988 --> 04:10.372
Don't worry about it.

04:10.423 --> 04:12.090
I was about to ask you guys
if you wanted to break bread.

04:12.125 --> 04:13.625
Yeah, and you
probably would've said

04:13.659 --> 04:15.210
something about sipping vino.

04:15.261 --> 04:17.930
I love saying "vino."

04:17.964 --> 04:20.599
Reagan, would you mind
telling me why we've got

04:20.632 --> 04:22.834
bass fishing champion
Tommy Biffle

04:22.852 --> 04:24.436
booked as a guest next week?
What?

04:24.470 --> 04:25.604
Or why the day after that
I'll be sitting down

04:25.638 --> 04:27.672
with Nascar legend
Richard petty?

04:27.690 --> 04:30.392
What're we gonna talk about?
Car parts and mustache care?

04:30.443 --> 04:32.144
Okay, wait a minute. Wait.
Who booked these people?

04:32.178 --> 04:33.612
I did.

04:33.646 --> 04:35.147
I'm playing cards tonight
with the Southern affiliates.

04:35.181 --> 04:37.232
We want them to move the show
to their 3:00 time slot,

04:37.283 --> 04:40.018
so I'm gonna
have to convince them

04:40.036 --> 04:41.320
that Ava's got
some Southern appeal.

04:41.354 --> 04:43.372
You don't think
she has Southern appeal?

04:43.406 --> 04:45.741
Okay, she grew up in the Florida
panhandle, all right?

04:45.792 --> 04:46.875
I mean, she...

04:46.910 --> 04:48.327
she bought Pepsis
at the wiggly piggly.

04:48.361 --> 04:49.578
Piggly wiggly.

04:49.629 --> 04:51.029
I still don't even
believe that's a thing.

04:51.047 --> 04:54.299
- And I want in
on this so-called "card game."

04:54.334 --> 04:56.034
Really don't think
that's a good idea, Ava.

04:56.052 --> 04:57.336
These are guy's guys.

04:57.370 --> 04:58.637
Most of them
are ex-military like me.

04:58.671 --> 04:59.638
They're old school.

04:59.672 --> 05:01.006
What, you guys sit around

05:01.040 --> 05:03.225
dressed like colonel Sanders
or something?

05:03.259 --> 05:04.927
I say, I say...

05:04.978 --> 05:06.878
I think the women folk
need to make some mint juleps

05:06.896 --> 05:09.314
while the men take care
of the business at hand.

05:09.349 --> 05:11.883
Okay, they're not
cartoon roosters.

05:11.901 --> 05:14.102
But, dudes,
I appreciate the concern,

05:14.153 --> 05:15.553
however, I know
what makes these guys tick,

05:15.571 --> 05:17.489
so, I got this.

05:17.523 --> 05:18.723
Ugh.

05:18.741 --> 05:20.909
Look at him walk.
One, two, one, two.

05:20.944 --> 05:22.394
Look at me,
I'm using my alternating legs

05:22.412 --> 05:24.896
to go from point a to point b.

05:24.914 --> 05:26.531
- Bad walking was a weak area.
- That's not our best stuff.

05:26.565 --> 05:29.234
Now I know why
your girlfriend dumped you!

05:29.252 --> 05:31.503
- Ooh, I don't think
he heard you, but that's...

05:31.537 --> 05:33.055
that's like...
that's the right idea.

05:33.089 --> 05:35.740
Oh, man...I gotta say,
I'm kind of nervous.

05:35.758 --> 05:37.259
I really want this to go well.

05:37.293 --> 05:39.294
Really?
A bowling shirt?

05:39.345 --> 05:41.213
What? It's fun.

05:41.247 --> 05:43.131
Come on, when else
am I gonna wear this?

05:43.182 --> 05:44.132
Oh, I don't know.

05:44.183 --> 05:45.133
The next time you're

05:45.184 --> 05:47.602
in a Vince Vaughn movie,
circa 1994.

05:47.637 --> 05:49.972
- Are you...
this is so money.

05:50.023 --> 05:52.391
God, all these balls suck.

05:52.425 --> 05:54.359
I just need one where my thumb
is flush with the thing.

05:54.394 --> 05:55.978
Do you remember
the last time we were bowling,

05:56.029 --> 05:59.231
and I missed that 7-6-10 spare
because my thumb was all floppy?

05:59.265 --> 06:01.616
It was one of
your better tantrums.

06:01.651 --> 06:05.570
Uh, you mean the natural
human reaction to injustice?

06:05.604 --> 06:08.740
Honey, please, I am begging
you to not get too competitive.

06:08.774 --> 06:10.492
- Won't.
- I won't, honey, I swear.

06:10.543 --> 06:11.910
Hi, guys. Hi.

06:11.944 --> 06:14.496
- Hey.
- Sorry we're late, you guys.

06:14.547 --> 06:16.614
It's just so hard saying
good-night to little foster.

06:16.632 --> 06:18.133
He is such an angel.

06:18.167 --> 06:19.885
- Dude, where'd you get
that sweet-ass shirt?

06:19.919 --> 06:21.920
Oh, uh, wasteland on Melrose.

06:21.954 --> 06:24.673
Wasteland on Melrose.
Wow, that sounds cool.

06:24.724 --> 06:25.891
Yeah, thank you.

06:25.925 --> 06:27.726
- You... you've got
your own ball.

06:27.760 --> 06:30.462
Uh, no, I'm gonna use
one of those gross balls

06:30.480 --> 06:31.596
where my thumb's all floppy.

06:32.631 --> 06:34.599
What am I, an idiot?

06:34.633 --> 06:37.686
No. You're fantastic.

06:37.737 --> 06:39.905
So, I said to her,

06:39.939 --> 06:43.191
"honey, that's not why they
call it a riding lawnmower."

06:47.580 --> 06:49.081
Oh, women.

06:49.115 --> 06:52.117
They just don't get things.

06:54.037 --> 06:55.787
All right, guys.
Drink up.

06:55.821 --> 06:57.422
Come on, ray,
you were in the Navy,

06:57.457 --> 06:58.656
but you're drinking like
you were in the coast guard.

06:58.674 --> 07:01.626
Oh...

07:01.660 --> 07:05.147
Hello, boys.

07:05.181 --> 07:07.182
Ava.
What're you doing here?

07:07.216 --> 07:09.301
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:09.335 --> 07:14.306
Did I need a formal invite to
the hayseed sausage festival?

07:14.340 --> 07:15.557
Hi, there.

07:15.608 --> 07:16.725
Move over, Tex.

07:16.776 --> 07:18.777
The name's hoyt.

07:18.811 --> 07:21.113
Of course it is.
Now...

07:21.147 --> 07:23.348
Let's get down

07:23.366 --> 07:25.650
to bidness.

07:25.684 --> 07:28.437
Chip me.
Can I have some of that?

07:28.715 --> 07:30.933
So I googled...

07:31.223 --> 07:36.060
Alabama head football coach
Nick Sa-bahn.

07:36.094 --> 07:38.229
He was wearing
pleated-front khakis.

07:38.263 --> 07:41.232
I mean, come on, man,
where's your stylist?

07:43.335 --> 07:45.269
- It's not "sa-bahn,"
it's Saban.

07:45.303 --> 07:48.572
Who cares, tubby?

07:48.607 --> 07:50.407
This is a real broad.

07:50.442 --> 07:53.410
- You're a broad.
- Oh-ho-ho!

07:53.445 --> 07:56.146
You know what, Luke,
I've never watched the show,

07:56.164 --> 07:58.532
but if it's half as funny
as she is in person,

07:58.583 --> 08:00.451
I think it's time
we showed Ava some love.

08:00.485 --> 08:01.818
Yeah.

08:01.837 --> 08:04.038
Well, according to your wife,
I'll be disappointed.

08:04.089 --> 08:05.256
- Oh-ho!

08:08.510 --> 08:09.793
♪  little miss,
little miss ♪

08:09.827 --> 08:12.162
♪  little miss
can't be wrong ♪

08:12.180 --> 08:16.634
♪  ain't nobody gonna bow no more

08:16.668 --> 08:18.769
we're either gonna
have to unplug the jukebox

08:18.803 --> 08:20.504
or we're going to
have to kill them.

08:20.522 --> 08:22.606
Yeah, and the jukebox
is all the way over there.

08:22.641 --> 08:24.508
- Heh!
- Right?

08:24.526 --> 08:25.676
♪  rock and roll song

08:25.694 --> 08:26.944
oh, yeah.

08:26.978 --> 08:27.995
Hey, guys, bring it
in for a second, will you?

08:28.029 --> 08:29.446
Come here.

08:29.481 --> 08:32.149
I don't know, I might be jumping
the gun here a little bit.

08:32.183 --> 08:37.955
I'm just feeling this a lot,
and I don't know.

08:37.989 --> 08:39.356
Three words...

08:39.374 --> 08:43.126
Napa Valley weekend.

08:43.160 --> 08:46.213
- No, she's kidding, you guy...
no, no, no, she's jus... too soon.

08:46.248 --> 08:48.165
She might as well
have said "four-way."

08:48.199 --> 08:50.534
Two words...

08:50.569 --> 08:52.086
We're in.

08:52.137 --> 08:53.337
For the Napa Valley thing,
not the four-way.

08:53.371 --> 08:54.588
Oh!

08:54.639 --> 08:56.807
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No offense, in so many ways.

08:56.841 --> 08:58.175
- Yeah, a ton of ways.
- Yeah.

08:58.209 --> 09:00.394
- Oh, you guys, this is perfect.
- Fun.

09:00.428 --> 09:02.513
Seriously, we have not
had couple friends

09:02.547 --> 09:04.381
that we want to spend
more than 10 minutes with,

09:04.416 --> 09:05.933
let alone an entire weekend.

09:05.984 --> 09:07.484
- This is... could not
have gone better.

09:07.519 --> 09:09.853
Let's just... let's just cut
our losses and call it a night.

09:09.887 --> 09:10.854
Good times.

09:10.888 --> 09:12.289
Hold the phone, dudes.

09:12.324 --> 09:13.724
We gots to bowl.

09:13.742 --> 09:14.992
Do we?

09:15.026 --> 09:16.893
- We absolutely have to bowl.
- We have to bowl.

09:16.912 --> 09:18.829
Uh, loser treats,
winner eats.

09:18.863 --> 09:20.897
- Uh, sounds good to me.
- Okay.

09:20.916 --> 09:24.368
Because when I win,
I am gonna be thirsty...

09:24.402 --> 09:26.503
For beer
that I will be drinking...

09:26.538 --> 09:28.739
Uh, for free.

09:28.757 --> 09:31.091
'Cause I gonna win the game.

09:31.126 --> 09:32.092
I'm just...

09:32.127 --> 09:33.210
I'm gonna get a better ball.

09:33.244 --> 09:35.412
I'm just gonna
loosen up my lats.

09:35.430 --> 09:38.081
I think that ball
is pretty shiny.

09:38.099 --> 09:40.017
Uh, oh, boy.

09:40.051 --> 09:41.752
Uh, damn shoes.

09:41.770 --> 09:44.588
Hey, hoyt. Heads up.

09:44.606 --> 09:46.557
And I don't want to see you
sniffing those things,

09:46.591 --> 09:48.091
freak show.

09:49.728 --> 09:50.811
Hoyt, give me those.

09:50.862 --> 09:52.229
Ava...

09:52.263 --> 09:55.065
Ava, wait up.

09:55.099 --> 09:57.101
Do you want me to help you
put your shoes on,

09:57.135 --> 09:58.736
or hold back your hair
while you hurl?

09:58.770 --> 09:59.770
Why? I'm great.

09:59.788 --> 10:01.071
You're great?

10:01.105 --> 10:04.575
Yeah. I got us the 3:00
time slot, didn't I?

10:04.609 --> 10:07.277
Oh, and by the way,
hoyt is a total liar.

10:07.295 --> 10:09.946
If these are Cuban,
I am Gloria Estefan.

10:09.965 --> 10:11.498
- You're sober?
- Yeah.

10:11.549 --> 10:13.417
I guess I can
handle guy's guys,

10:13.451 --> 10:16.754
even though I'm cursed with
bosoms and baby-making parts.

10:16.788 --> 10:19.089
- Well, actually,
I have baby-making parts...

10:19.123 --> 10:21.291
Anyway, what you did in there
was amazing. Thank you.

10:21.309 --> 10:23.126
- It was, wasn't it?
- Yes.

10:23.144 --> 10:25.729
I feel the need to take you
for a drink, for real.

10:25.764 --> 10:27.598
Great. I'll wrap it up.

10:27.632 --> 10:28.599
Let's do it.

10:28.633 --> 10:29.850
- Thank you.
- Your shoes.

10:29.901 --> 10:32.519
All right,
you human heart attacks,

10:32.554 --> 10:34.438
last hand.

10:34.472 --> 10:37.191
Pull your pants back up and
stop doing each other's makeup.

10:41.145 --> 10:42.112
Come on.

10:42.146 --> 10:43.364
Get there,
get there, get there.

10:43.415 --> 10:44.999
Oh!
Oh!

10:45.033 --> 10:46.116
- I over-muscled it.

10:46.150 --> 10:48.502
There's too much
"musculare."

10:48.536 --> 10:52.006
Okay, Justin, we just
need seven pins, okay? Seven.

10:52.040 --> 10:54.091
Do you know
what we should do in Napa?

10:54.125 --> 10:55.843
Hot air balloon.

10:55.877 --> 10:58.262
Oh, my God,
that's on Chris's bucket list.

10:58.296 --> 11:00.297
No way.
Dude, you're freaking me out.

11:00.331 --> 11:02.633
- No, you're freaking me out.
- Reagan.

11:02.667 --> 11:04.018
Reagan!
Oh, boy.

11:04.052 --> 11:07.805
Hope you like a 3:00
time slot...In the South.

11:07.839 --> 11:09.807
Oh, my God,
you crashed that meeting?

11:09.841 --> 11:12.008
They loved me.

11:12.027 --> 11:13.927
There was an Asian gentleman
named Bobby

11:13.962 --> 11:15.112
eating out of my hand,

11:15.146 --> 11:17.031
literally, he was eating
chex mix like a horse.

11:17.065 --> 11:18.515
- That's weird.
- Yeah.

11:18.533 --> 11:20.451
And Luke was so impressed
he's taking me out for a drink.

11:20.485 --> 11:22.653
Good! Well,
this is going pretty great.

11:22.687 --> 11:26.540
- Oh, these are your new gays.
- Shh. Come on, now.

11:26.574 --> 11:28.158
Oh, don't worry.
They love me.

11:28.192 --> 11:32.379
Hey, you bitches, mama's here!

11:32.414 --> 11:34.998
- God.
- Whoa, you turkeys are gay?

11:35.032 --> 11:36.633
I didn't...
- What? We had no idea.

11:36.668 --> 11:38.585
Well, we have an announcement.

11:38.636 --> 11:40.838
Chris and I
happen to be straight.

11:40.872 --> 11:42.806
Yes. We are.

11:42.841 --> 11:45.175
Not that it's
necessarily better.

11:45.209 --> 11:47.094
- No, it's worse.
- Way worse, in fact.

11:47.145 --> 11:48.512
And I...

11:48.546 --> 11:50.013
I've actually
kissed a guy before.

11:50.047 --> 11:51.148
Are you kidding?

11:51.182 --> 11:52.733
- No, it was a French, uh...
French dude,

11:52.767 --> 11:54.485
and we were trying to do
the kiss on the cheek thing,

11:54.519 --> 11:56.153
and I turned the wrong way,
and I happened

11:56.187 --> 11:57.821
to catch mouth corner.

11:57.856 --> 11:59.106
But I'm... I'm better for the
experience is what I'm saying.

11:59.157 --> 12:00.274
I get it now.

12:00.325 --> 12:01.575
You don't need
to always tell the story.

12:01.609 --> 12:04.194
Ava, it's so nice to meet you.
We are huge fans.

12:04.228 --> 12:05.612
- Yes, we're... yes, yes.

12:05.663 --> 12:07.865
And you're just in time to watch
Lawrence seal our victory.

12:07.899 --> 12:08.866
Oh!

12:08.900 --> 12:10.066
No pressure, no pressure.

12:10.085 --> 12:12.336
- Oh, here we go. Here we go.
- No pressure.

12:12.370 --> 12:15.038
All right, go, go, focus.

12:15.072 --> 12:17.958
Focus, focus, focus, focus...

12:18.009 --> 12:20.928
Baby, baby, baby...

12:20.962 --> 12:21.929
Yes! Yes!

12:21.963 --> 12:24.080
- Okay, we did it.
- Oh, my God!

12:24.099 --> 12:25.766
I can't believe you got that!

12:25.800 --> 12:27.751
Winner's circle!
Feels good!

12:27.769 --> 12:28.802
The loser pit.

12:28.853 --> 12:30.104
The pit for losers.

12:30.138 --> 12:32.055
Pullin' into dookie-shame
junction! Oh, yes! Yes!

12:32.089 --> 12:33.724
Okay,
and get yourself together.

12:33.758 --> 12:35.609
Hey, listen, it's all right.
You beat us fair and square.

12:35.643 --> 12:36.610
Right.

12:36.644 --> 12:38.445
Eh, sorta.

12:38.480 --> 12:40.230
What does that mean, "sorta"?

12:40.264 --> 12:41.231
Oh...

12:41.265 --> 12:43.066
- Reagan...
- There was...

12:43.100 --> 12:47.571
There was an issue of
a foot fault in the fifth frame.

12:47.605 --> 12:51.408
I mean, like, technically,
those pins would be voided.

12:51.442 --> 12:53.494
I don't know, here, I marked it.
I marked it on there.

12:53.545 --> 12:55.629
- You marked it?
- Score sheet.

12:55.663 --> 12:56.797
Okay, so,
we're counting foot faults.

12:56.831 --> 12:58.248
Uh, yeah, you mean
playing by the rules?

12:58.282 --> 12:59.616
No.

12:59.634 --> 13:01.335
No, you know what? I should
really just let it slide.

13:01.386 --> 13:03.387
Like your foot did,
over the... the line.

13:03.421 --> 13:04.638
- Guys, I...

13:04.672 --> 13:06.173
- do you know what?
I... but hold... but you know what?

13:06.224 --> 13:07.424
If I'd have known
we were playing this way,

13:07.458 --> 13:09.393
I, uh... I would've
actually tried.

13:09.427 --> 13:10.394
I would've tried.
Oh, really?

13:10.428 --> 13:12.679
Johnny mc-own-ball?

13:12.730 --> 13:14.381
Sammy van-bowling-glove.

13:14.415 --> 13:15.899
Okay, that's not
my name at all.

13:15.934 --> 13:17.768
I don't know
who's side I'm on.

13:17.802 --> 13:20.070
I mean, Reagan's my oldest
friend, but I do love a gay.

13:20.104 --> 13:21.972
We'll get it.
It's totally fine.

13:21.990 --> 13:23.473
- Oh, no, n-n-n-no.
Then you can be the hero?

13:23.491 --> 13:24.942
No, I don't think so.
I don't think you'll get it.

13:24.976 --> 13:26.360
- I'm not trying to be a hero.
- Okay? Thank you so much.

13:26.411 --> 13:29.079
No, I'd actually like
to pay for it because we lost.

13:29.113 --> 13:30.247
Remember? Loser's circle.
Remember that?

13:30.281 --> 13:31.532
- You know what?
- Forget it.

13:31.583 --> 13:32.783
We're gonna split it.
Okay? We'll split it.

13:32.817 --> 13:33.951
- Oh, yeah.
- Here you go.

13:33.985 --> 13:35.502
Yeah, why don't you
just run away?

13:35.537 --> 13:37.621
Just run away
in what I'm assuming

13:37.655 --> 13:40.123
are custom-cobbled
bowling shoes!

13:40.157 --> 13:42.543
Did I blow this?

13:42.594 --> 13:45.712
I'm sorry I'm so late.

13:45.763 --> 13:47.464
I just witnessed
a bowling alley tragedy.

13:47.498 --> 13:48.799
Oh.

13:48.833 --> 13:49.967
You took so long to get here,

13:50.001 --> 13:51.468
I decided to get a little bit
of a head start.

13:51.502 --> 13:52.669
Hey, buddy, big boy.

13:52.687 --> 13:54.471
You look like someone.
Who do you look like?

13:54.505 --> 13:55.973
Who do you look like?

13:56.007 --> 13:57.307
Eh, never mind.

13:57.341 --> 13:59.059
I think we should toast.
Oh.

13:59.110 --> 14:01.011
To our new time slot.

14:01.029 --> 14:03.947
You were a champion and a lady.

14:03.982 --> 14:07.568
Well, thank you.

14:07.619 --> 14:09.953
The fun thing about vodka.

14:09.988 --> 14:12.188
Russian people
pronounce it "wodka."

14:13.791 --> 14:16.126
They also say sputnik,
bolshevik,

14:16.160 --> 14:17.744
babooshka...

14:17.795 --> 14:19.195
<i>nyet!</i>

14:19.214 --> 14:20.247
Luke, what are you doing?

14:20.298 --> 14:22.249
- I-I just was...
- Forget it.

14:22.300 --> 14:23.417
I thought we were having

14:23.468 --> 14:25.702
a successful
business relationship.

14:25.720 --> 14:27.754
I thought the same thing
with Suge Knight and Ira Glass.

14:27.805 --> 14:30.807
You guys are all alike.
<i>Dasvidaniya!</i>

14:30.842 --> 14:33.427
Ava, wait.
Ava, Ava.

14:34.780 --> 14:37.883
Ok so wait, did his hand
just brush your shoulder

14:38.253 --> 14:39.703
or did it grab your shoulder?

14:39.737 --> 14:42.289
Was it like this,
or like this?

14:42.340 --> 14:44.925
Missy!
Keep doing that.

14:44.959 --> 14:46.677
Okay, you know what?
This is unacceptable.

14:46.711 --> 14:48.011
I mean, what does he think,

14:48.046 --> 14:49.379
that we're part
of his steno pool?

14:49.413 --> 14:50.631
Hi, guys.

14:50.682 --> 14:52.916
Don't you mean "dollfaces"?

14:52.934 --> 14:54.601
"Skirts"?

14:54.636 --> 14:56.419
Ladies, a man
has entered the room.

14:56.437 --> 14:59.923
Please present yourselves
for bottom pinching.

14:59.941 --> 15:02.025
No, see, missy,
I was making a point.

15:02.060 --> 15:03.310
It's not really like...
we're not gonna actually pres...

15:03.361 --> 15:04.427
- guys, calm down.

15:04.445 --> 15:07.114
Help yourselves
to a complimentary tampon.

15:07.148 --> 15:09.483
Let me talk to Luke.

15:09.534 --> 15:12.435
Hmm.

15:12.453 --> 15:16.156
Ava, I am really sorry.

15:16.207 --> 15:17.541
What the hell was that?

15:17.575 --> 15:19.293
- You remember
my ex-fiancee?

15:19.327 --> 15:20.610
She was the bartender
last night.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.379
Oh, the one
with the synthetic hair weave.

15:22.413 --> 15:24.598
- Mm...
- That was not human hair.

15:24.632 --> 15:26.917
Anyway, I go there
every night after work,

15:26.935 --> 15:29.236
and I sit alone at the bar,
and I drink.

15:29.270 --> 15:30.687
Just to see her.

15:30.722 --> 15:33.974
Last night I thought, boy,
if I could bring Ava Alexander

15:34.025 --> 15:36.476
into this bar,
she would go crazy.

15:36.527 --> 15:38.929
- Well, of course.
- So, I'm really sorry.

15:38.947 --> 15:41.264
I guess I just can't
seem to get over her.

15:41.282 --> 15:44.785
My ex Kevin...

15:44.819 --> 15:49.773
I wear his deodorant brand
so I can remember his smell.

15:50.792 --> 15:52.943
Oh, right guard sport.

15:53.228 --> 15:55.095
I work late every night,
and I blast music,

15:55.146 --> 15:56.880
and I hope I don't
end up in that bar.

15:56.898 --> 15:58.815
You're working
on the night moves.

15:58.850 --> 16:01.401
Trying to make
some front page, drive-in news.

16:01.436 --> 16:03.720
- I don't know if that's...
what?

16:03.738 --> 16:05.906
We both need to move on.

16:05.940 --> 16:09.409
I will let you blast all
the after-hours seger you want

16:09.444 --> 16:11.895
if you promise me you will
stop hanging out at that bar.

16:11.913 --> 16:13.580
It's pathetic, Luke.

16:13.615 --> 16:16.200
Like that guy eating chex mix
out of my hand pathetic.

16:16.234 --> 16:17.885
Bobby definitely
has a problem.

16:17.919 --> 16:19.203
7:00, and all is well.

16:19.237 --> 16:21.872
Every mailbox is on its post.

16:21.906 --> 16:25.008
Every house safe and secure.

16:25.043 --> 16:28.356
Gene's in his element.
He was rotc in college.

16:28.567 --> 16:31.035
Yeah, but I couldn't serve.
I have an ulcerated esophagus.

16:31.069 --> 16:33.454
It's often caused by herpes.
Mine wasn't.

16:33.488 --> 16:35.957
You guys sure you don't
want reflective vests?

16:35.991 --> 16:38.209
- No, we're good.
- I'd rather be hit by a car.

16:40.796 --> 16:43.547
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, I'm so... I'm so sorry.

16:43.582 --> 16:45.616
I'm so competitive.
Ugh, me too.

16:45.634 --> 16:46.884
I should've stopped him.

16:46.919 --> 16:49.453
You know,
I'm a conflict avoider.

16:49.471 --> 16:52.473
And while we're at it,
I also say "supposably."

16:52.507 --> 16:53.975
He does. He does.
It's a nightmare.

16:54.009 --> 16:55.059
- Ooh.
- It is.

16:55.093 --> 16:56.427
Guys, I own
three pairs of crocs.

16:56.461 --> 16:57.561
- You shut your mouth.
- Oh, no!

16:57.596 --> 16:59.463
And I wear a "life is good"
tee shirt.

16:59.481 --> 17:02.350
Oh, you know what?
This is good.

17:02.401 --> 17:05.069
Now we know that we like
each other, warts and all.

17:05.103 --> 17:06.404
Yeah, warts and all.

17:06.438 --> 17:08.806
Hey, are you guys
thinking what I'm thinking?

17:08.824 --> 17:11.025
Maybe we do a little
do-over here.

17:11.076 --> 17:12.576
Come on, after this,
we'll go grab some drinks,

17:12.611 --> 17:13.944
go to our place,
you guys bring foster over.

17:13.979 --> 17:15.246
It'll be super fun.

17:15.280 --> 17:16.814
- That'd be awesome.
- Yeah, let's do it.

17:16.832 --> 17:18.199
We'll bring snacks.

17:18.250 --> 17:21.151
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

17:21.169 --> 17:23.753
- This... these...

17:23.789 --> 17:25.589
these cookies are really...
they're really, um...

17:25.624 --> 17:28.041
- they're delicious.
- Yeah.

17:28.093 --> 17:29.543
Oh, good.
Uh, Lawrence made 'em.

17:29.594 --> 17:30.962
- Hi.
- Secret's a dollop of honey.

17:30.996 --> 17:33.714
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...
- Oh!

17:33.765 --> 17:35.099
Oh, yeah.

17:35.133 --> 17:36.834
- So, is... is little, um...

17:36.852 --> 17:38.386
little foster...
is he okay?

17:38.437 --> 17:40.471
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:40.505 --> 17:42.640
New environments stimulate him.
Yeah, is that... is that okay?

17:42.674 --> 17:45.009
Oh, yeah.
Sure, no, of course.

17:45.027 --> 17:48.956
We just... we wouldn't want him
to get, um, too stimulated.

17:49.076 --> 17:49.814
That's it.

17:49.848 --> 17:51.515
From throwing
all our stuff on the floor.

17:51.533 --> 17:53.701
- He's okay. He's okay, I think.
- Yeah.

17:54.953 --> 17:56.070
Um, we just feel
it's really important

17:56.121 --> 17:57.187
not to put too many
boundaries on foster.

17:57.205 --> 17:59.290
- Is that
an approach that's...

17:59.324 --> 18:01.459
- yeah, it stifles
his creativity.

18:01.493 --> 18:03.527
- Yeah, you wouldn't...
you wouldn't want to do that.

18:08.884 --> 18:10.301
There you are.

18:10.335 --> 18:12.303
What the hell
are you doing here?

18:12.337 --> 18:13.871
Ava, I'm sorry.

18:13.889 --> 18:15.205
How dare you come
to a bar without me.

18:15.223 --> 18:16.924
I could kill you.

18:16.975 --> 18:17.925
Wait, what is happening?

18:17.976 --> 18:19.877
I am going to
fake kiss you right now,

18:19.895 --> 18:23.981
then you're going to leave
this bar with some dignity.

18:31.857 --> 18:33.557
That was fantastic.

18:33.575 --> 18:35.192
Now, let's go back to my place

18:35.226 --> 18:39.363
for some athletic,
'70s-style lovemaking.

18:39.397 --> 18:41.449
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

18:41.500 --> 18:43.334
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

18:43.368 --> 18:44.452
That kid's a monster.

18:44.503 --> 18:46.954
I've never
hated a kid before.

18:47.005 --> 18:48.497
I'm just gonna
go ahead and say it.

18:48.617 --> 18:49.239
Foster's an a-hole.

18:49.257 --> 18:50.791
Honey, you can't
say that about a kid.

18:50.842 --> 18:52.176
I just said it,
and it felt good.

18:52.210 --> 18:54.295
You know what,
it's not foster's fault.

18:54.346 --> 18:55.679
Lawrence and Justin
are great guys,

18:55.714 --> 18:57.247
I love hanging out with them,
but you can't have that.

18:57.265 --> 18:58.883
We should say something.

18:58.917 --> 19:00.801
I mean,
I guess Lawrence and Justin

19:00.836 --> 19:03.437
are pretty
understanding guys, right?

19:03.472 --> 19:04.939
Yeah, I mean,
warts and all, right?

19:04.973 --> 19:06.807
I mean, that's what's
so great about the four of us.

19:06.858 --> 19:07.925
Warts and all.

19:07.943 --> 19:09.894
So, it's just that...

19:09.928 --> 19:11.946
- Oh...
- What an angel.

19:11.980 --> 19:14.765
- So, what I... what I'm
really saying is that

19:14.783 --> 19:17.545
it's like babies
and... and toddlers...

19:17.845 --> 19:22.362
They want to know
that there are limits. You know.

19:22.482 --> 19:25.103
They find it reassuring

19:25.451 --> 19:28.245
knowing that someone's
looking after them.

19:28.279 --> 19:31.966
Yeah, it's just...
It's better parenting.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.252
- That's all.
- Wow.

19:35.286 --> 19:37.922
That's really hard to hear,
you guys.

19:37.956 --> 19:39.974
Oh, boy.

19:40.008 --> 19:42.593
- But really helpful.
- Yeah. Yeah.

19:42.627 --> 19:44.395
No, we really respect you guys,

19:44.429 --> 19:46.797
so it's nice to get
an outside perspective.

19:46.815 --> 19:48.349
Phew!

19:48.400 --> 19:52.136
Kick off my heels,
'cause I was really nervous

19:52.154 --> 19:53.604
about how you were
gonna take that.

19:53.638 --> 19:56.073
And while we're, you know,
uh, sharing parental tips,

19:56.108 --> 19:57.942
we had some advice
for you guys too.

19:57.976 --> 20:01.579
What is it?

20:01.613 --> 20:02.797
I mean...

20:02.831 --> 20:05.249
Just the way you always
keep Amy in her stroller,

20:05.283 --> 20:06.750
or her play saucer, you know,

20:06.785 --> 20:10.287
it's just kind of
oppressive, you know.

20:10.321 --> 20:12.489
- Are you  kidding me?
- Okay...

20:12.507 --> 20:15.431
Can you believe those two?

20:15.551 --> 20:16.160
Yeah, who do they
think they are

20:16.178 --> 20:17.261
talking to us about parenting?

20:17.295 --> 20:19.213
I never completely
bought into them.

20:19.264 --> 20:21.132
There was always
something sinister.

20:21.166 --> 20:24.185
- The gay thing was so cool.
- The gay was great.

20:24.219 --> 20:25.586
Aww...

20:35.627 --> 20:36.977
Reagan...

20:37.011 --> 20:39.546
I know you guys are on the
market for new couple friends,

20:39.580 --> 20:41.915
and I just met Jeff and Tracy
at an aspca benefit. Guys?

20:41.966 --> 20:43.000
They've got a kid,
but they're fun,

20:43.034 --> 20:44.001
and I told them
how much fun you are.

20:44.035 --> 20:46.253
Wait, are you all right?

20:46.304 --> 20:47.504
What are you dressed as?

20:47.538 --> 20:49.072
A person going to bed.

20:49.107 --> 20:50.507
What's on your face?

20:50.541 --> 20:53.349
You're right,
this stuff is totally tingling.

20:53.469 --> 20:54.383
Oh God.

20:54.503 --> 20:56.787
Christopher, I do not want to
see how the sausage is made.

20:56.907 --> 20:59.143
Jeff and Tracy I am so sorry

20:59.263 --> 21:01.021
this is mortifying.
