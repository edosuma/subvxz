01:06.478 --> 01:08.179
Thanks, Jill.

01:19.825 --> 01:21.459
Oh, good, Jeff...

01:21.461 --> 01:23.961
Yeah, we'll hear all about your
ideas in the room, all right?

01:23.963 --> 01:25.496
With all due respect, Jeff...

01:25.498 --> 01:27.265
I don't think we need a
cyber-security firm right now...

01:27.267 --> 01:29.233
I think we need the president...
And a plan.

01:29.235 --> 01:32.470
I can put a team on the ground to
attack in a matter of momen...

01:32.472 --> 01:34.472
This isn't a terrorist
cell out of Damascus.

01:34.474 --> 01:37.108
We can't just blow
up the Internet.

01:37.110 --> 01:39.030
This is a single server
we're talking about here.

01:39.054 --> 01:40.812
The possibilities are endless.

01:40.814 --> 01:42.246
I understand very well the
complexities of the Internet.

01:42.248 --> 01:43.247
I don't think you do. Oh, I do.

01:43.249 --> 01:45.183
Gentlemen, please let me finish.

01:45.185 --> 01:47.285
These terrorists sent
text messages...

01:47.287 --> 01:49.020
To very specific cell phones.

01:49.022 --> 01:52.089
Only individuals directly
connected to the markets.

01:52.091 --> 01:54.025
I don't know why they'd warn
the rich stockbrokers...

01:54.027 --> 01:55.359
But they said that they've
already hacked...

01:55.361 --> 01:56.961
The New York stock
exchange backup.

01:56.963 --> 01:59.096
We ran a security protocol
and it checks out.

01:59.098 --> 02:01.132
- We found a breach.
- Jeff? - Yes, Sarah?

02:01.134 --> 02:03.835
There will absolutely be a run
on the banks. On everything.

02:03.837 --> 02:07.205
And eventually if we cross our
fingers, and pray hard enough...

02:07.207 --> 02:09.047
And we get the markets
back online, those, too.

02:09.071 --> 02:10.508
You're assuming that
this is what...

02:10.509 --> 02:13.244
Puts the public over the
edge, the tipping point.

02:13.246 --> 02:14.486
That's right. Finally revolting.

02:14.510 --> 02:16.080
Getting up off their couches.
Yes!

02:16.082 --> 02:18.082
Running to the bank to get the...
Yes. Yes. Yes.

02:18.084 --> 02:20.324
Stuff it in their mattress?
Yes, that is what I'm saying.

02:20.348 --> 02:23.015
We are not looking
at bankruptcy.

02:24.456 --> 02:26.958
We'd like to present an option.

02:26.960 --> 02:30.261
These terrorists used a
stolen software program...

02:30.263 --> 02:31.929
To hack the market.

02:31.931 --> 02:35.032
This is the man who created
it six months ago...

02:35.034 --> 02:37.034
To increase his company's
earnings on the...

02:37.036 --> 02:39.570
Mercantile exchange by
about a billion dollars.

02:39.572 --> 02:42.907
I think we bring him in,
see if has any ideas.

02:42.909 --> 02:44.642
That's ridiculous.
I'm sorry, Paul?

02:44.644 --> 02:47.044
You can't be serious. Guy
Clifton, guy Clifton...

02:47.046 --> 02:48.479
Helped revolutionize how
cities consolidate...

02:48.481 --> 02:50.147
He's in the middle of
a federal hearing.

02:50.149 --> 02:51.983
And manage debt. He's
about to be indicted.

02:51.985 --> 02:53.184
Guy Clifton is being indicted
because he broke through...

02:53.186 --> 02:54.786
The same firewalls
these terrorists have.

02:54.810 --> 02:58.546
Excuse me. Who the
hell is guy Clifton?

03:01.059 --> 03:03.160
<i>Announcer the barometer of
America's prosperity...</i>

03:03.162 --> 03:05.229
<i>Traditionally has been
the stock exchange.</i>

03:07.399 --> 03:10.201
<i>The New York stock exchange
is almost as old...</i>

03:10.203 --> 03:11.335
<i>As America</i> itself...

03:11.337 --> 03:13.237
<i>Being founded in 1792...</i>

03:13.239 --> 03:16.407
<i>During George Washington's
first administration.</i>

03:19.645 --> 03:24.315
<i>67 years ago, 24 men met
under a buttonwood tree...</i>

03:24.317 --> 03:26.217
<i>At 68 wall street
for the purpose...</i>

03:26.219 --> 03:28.452
<i>Of trading and government bonds.</i>

03:32.157 --> 03:35.559
<i>Wall street has become
the symbol of money.</i>

03:37.091 --> 03:38.530
<i>Everybody, it seemed...</i>

03:38.531 --> 03:41.632
<i>Was on the way to
becoming a millionaire.</i>

03:45.470 --> 03:48.372
<i>There were plenty of buyers.
Not enough stock to go around.</i>

03:48.374 --> 03:50.374
<i>Wait your turn. It
was unheard of.</i>

03:50.376 --> 03:53.144
<i>Those who shouted the loudest
got in the firstest.</i>

03:56.381 --> 03:58.616
<i>And then all of a
sudden, wham-o!</i>

03:58.618 --> 04:02.486
<i>The next day, the Piper had
to be paid, and in full.</i>

04:02.488 --> 04:06.324
<i>The incredible boom became an
even more incredible bust...</i>

04:06.326 --> 04:09.460
<i>As the country plunged into
the depths of a depression.</i>

04:14.066 --> 04:18.168
<i>We made realistic rules so that
it could never happen again.</i>

04:18.171 --> 04:21.038
<i>Today you have a sounder, more
efficient stock exchange.</i>

04:21.040 --> 04:22.506
<i>It's the storehouse of funds...</i>

04:22.508 --> 04:25.042
<i>For America's ever
growing industry.</i>

04:25.044 --> 04:28.546
All right, we're live
in five, four, three...

04:38.390 --> 04:41.158
Guy Clifton, the man who
just two years ago...

04:41.160 --> 04:43.127
Pulled Chicago out
of bankruptcy...

04:43.129 --> 04:45.229
Is now facing multiple
charges in connection...

04:45.231 --> 04:48.132
With an incident on the Chicago
mercantile exchange...

04:48.134 --> 04:50.301
Where trading activity
was manipulated.

04:50.303 --> 04:51.635
<i>Manipulated.</i>

04:51.637 --> 04:53.571
<i>He rose fast through
the ranks...</i>

04:53.573 --> 04:56.507
<i>Youngest ever to achieve a spot
on a mercantile exchange floor.</i>

04:56.509 --> 04:59.076
<i>Quickly made a name for himself
and went on to found...</i>

04:59.078 --> 05:02.313
<i>Clifton holdings, before
assisting mayor rahm Emmanuel..</i>

05:02.315 --> 05:04.215
Shut it off, please.

05:04.217 --> 05:06.017
<i>In eradicating Chicago's
debt entirely.</i>

05:06.019 --> 05:08.019
<i>Ultimately though, money
got the better of him...</i>

05:08.043 --> 05:10.421
<i>When he recruited three
close friends to hack...</i>

05:10.423 --> 05:13.157
<i>The Chicago mercantile
exchange and manipulate...</i>

05:13.159 --> 05:15.559
<i>His company's earnings
on the market.</i>

05:15.561 --> 05:18.295
<i>We'll be right back with
more on this sad story of...</i>

05:31.309 --> 05:33.544
Hey. Hi.

05:33.546 --> 05:36.347
New book? No, it's for school.

05:36.349 --> 05:37.782
Ah...

05:42.521 --> 05:46.323
You caught up at school?
Keeping up okay?

05:46.325 --> 05:49.260
Did mom tell you to say that?

05:49.262 --> 05:54.131
You're a wise-ass. No.

05:54.133 --> 05:56.200
You know, the last time
we talked like this...

05:56.202 --> 05:59.637
I think I was doing...

05:59.639 --> 06:04.575
That stupid report
on local heroes.

06:04.577 --> 06:07.378
Do you remember?

06:09.114 --> 06:11.415
No. No?

06:11.417 --> 06:13.217
Yeah.

06:13.219 --> 06:16.187
Well, my teacher told
the whole class...

06:16.189 --> 06:19.256
That you had saved
Chicago from bankruptcy.

06:19.258 --> 06:21.792
She said, "this, kids..."

06:21.794 --> 06:24.095
"Is the perfect example
of a local hero."

06:29.167 --> 06:30.835
And now you're going to jail.

06:34.339 --> 06:38.509
Was it just all for the money?
I think we have enough.

06:40.479 --> 06:42.279
Who said that?

06:42.281 --> 06:43.347
Mom says that.

06:43.349 --> 06:44.715
Mom says I'm going to jail?

06:44.717 --> 06:47.785
No, my econ teacher says
you're going to jail.

06:47.787 --> 06:49.687
He says that's an absolute.

06:49.689 --> 06:50.888
Ah, an absolute.

06:50.890 --> 06:54.358
Mm-hm, mom says we
have too much money.

07:01.314 --> 07:03.234
We've been awaiting the
arrival of guy Clifton...

07:03.236 --> 07:04.468
For almost an hour now.

07:04.470 --> 07:06.137
This must really be testing...

07:06.139 --> 07:08.472
The judiciary committee
members inside, Paul.

07:08.474 --> 07:10.841
Now, this is just an
informational hearing.

07:13.745 --> 07:18.415
What do you think?
Should I call him?

07:18.417 --> 07:19.817
Yeah, I'll call him.

07:34.666 --> 07:35.733
Hey.

07:38.937 --> 07:40.738
Where's creason?
Where's creason?

07:40.740 --> 07:42.706
She left an hour ago.

07:42.708 --> 07:44.308
Like everyone else.

07:44.310 --> 07:46.277
Well, what did you think?

07:46.279 --> 07:48.245
Everyone was just
gonna wait for you?

07:48.247 --> 07:50.948
They're just looking to acquire
whatever information they can...

07:50.950 --> 07:53.651
About how Mr. Clifton
and a team of three...

07:53.653 --> 07:55.519
Were able to hack the market.

07:55.521 --> 07:56.820
It just doesn't look good...

07:56.822 --> 07:59.590
To keep a committee
waiting like this.

07:59.592 --> 08:01.432
I revolutionized the market.
I found loopholes.

08:01.434 --> 08:03.114
I've done things no
one's ever done before.

08:03.138 --> 08:04.595
What are they gonna
indict me on?

08:04.597 --> 08:06.363
You hacked the stock market.

08:06.365 --> 08:07.865
No one's ever done that before.

08:07.867 --> 08:09.800
It doesn't make it legal, guy.

08:09.802 --> 08:11.335
Are you beginning to see...

08:11.337 --> 08:12.937
That this is about
more than money, guy?

08:12.939 --> 08:14.939
Let me tell you something.
It's always about money.

08:14.941 --> 08:16.781
If I wasn't rich, they
wouldn't be indicting...

08:16.805 --> 08:17.937
Mr. Clifton.

08:19.844 --> 08:22.513
Yeah, can I help you, boys?
Guy Clifton?

08:22.515 --> 08:24.715
Your presence has
been requested.

08:24.717 --> 08:27.251
It's a matter of national security, Mr.
Clifton.

08:34.491 --> 08:35.592
Really?

08:35.595 --> 08:37.361
Please come with us.

08:38.830 --> 08:40.331
Okay.

08:41.399 --> 08:43.333
I have to go.

08:43.336 --> 08:46.870
If you're not going straight to
jail, then dinner's at 8:00.

08:46.872 --> 08:48.539
All right.

08:54.746 --> 08:56.546
Do you have any idea where
they're taking him?

08:56.570 --> 08:57.748
I do not.

08:57.750 --> 08:59.683
No.

09:16.901 --> 09:18.769
This way, Mr. Clifton.

09:24.476 --> 09:26.543
"The government may try
to suppress us..."

09:26.545 --> 09:28.545
"But they will not
annihilate us."

09:28.547 --> 09:31.982
"We seek justice against the
deceptive capitalist liars."

09:31.984 --> 09:35.319
The backside decrypts to a
map of the United States...

09:35.321 --> 09:39.390
Targeting the following cities
and their respective markets.

09:39.392 --> 09:42.726
Now, the specifics behind
motive and culprit...

09:42.728 --> 09:44.561
Is classified at this point.

09:44.563 --> 09:47.298
But I can tell you, they've
already breached...

09:47.300 --> 09:49.433
The New York stock
exchange backup server.

09:49.435 --> 09:51.902
So, in front of you is the
review of my projections...

09:51.904 --> 09:53.404
For total market failure.

09:53.406 --> 09:55.206
And these are the new
international numbers...

09:55.230 --> 09:56.507
You're getting now. Thanks, Mel.

09:56.509 --> 09:59.643
The reason why we're all here
in this room today, Ms. schwab.

09:59.645 --> 10:01.011
So as I was...

10:01.013 --> 10:05.616
Sorry. So sorry. Busy, busy day.
Thank you.

10:05.618 --> 10:08.686
Yeah, just get me a green tea.

10:08.688 --> 10:11.689
Please... continue.

10:11.691 --> 10:13.891
As I was saying, there is a
potential for this attack...

10:13.915 --> 10:15.059
To have global implications.

10:15.061 --> 10:17.728
Hijacking our entire market
system could throw us into...

10:17.730 --> 10:19.730
What is she talking about?
Total market failure.

10:19.732 --> 10:19.730
Our economy's on track.

10:19.732 --> 10:22.599
September 3rd, 1929,
we were on track, too.

10:22.601 --> 10:24.635
One month later, less so.

10:24.637 --> 10:28.605
This is not the great
depression, schwab.

10:28.607 --> 10:32.009
People have lost
faith in the system.

10:32.011 --> 10:35.045
Too big to fail is a
thing of the past.

10:35.047 --> 10:36.847
Am I the only one in
the room who thinks...

10:36.849 --> 10:38.082
It wouldn't be the worst
thing in the world...

10:38.084 --> 10:39.124
To be a bit more prepared?

10:39.148 --> 10:42.086
Prepared for what? Bankruptcy?

10:42.088 --> 10:44.988
Correct. Hm.

10:46.424 --> 10:48.425
We have till Monday.

10:53.631 --> 10:56.433
I want you to get me a list
of all our positions...

10:56.435 --> 10:58.769
Long and short, everything
in the portfolio.

10:58.771 --> 11:00.871
Then I want you to call my
wife, tell her I'm okay.

11:00.873 --> 11:02.005
Clifton!

11:02.007 --> 11:04.575
Yeah. Do that now, please.

11:04.577 --> 11:08.545
Well, what do you think?

11:08.547 --> 11:10.481
I think I'm gonna move
my money offshore.

11:10.483 --> 11:12.416
That's what I think.

11:12.418 --> 11:15.686
Come on. Help me fix this.

11:15.688 --> 11:17.988
What's in it for me?

11:21.092 --> 11:23.827
You'd better sell that
mutual fund, schwab.

11:29.701 --> 11:33.637
Fuck. Douchebag.

11:33.639 --> 11:35.719
What do you want for dinner?
I was thinking salmon...

11:35.743 --> 11:36.840
Creason likes salmon.

11:36.842 --> 11:39.977
I hate fish. I hate fish.
I hate fish.

11:39.979 --> 11:42.079
We'll do salmon.

11:42.081 --> 11:43.947
Who'd you give my office to?

11:43.949 --> 11:45.229
You never used
your office, babe.

11:45.253 --> 11:47.184
I used my office.
I used it once.

11:47.186 --> 11:48.819
You know what else?

11:48.821 --> 11:50.487
I gotta get your
access card back.

11:50.489 --> 11:52.623
It's called the
Clifton-Willis foundation.

11:52.625 --> 11:53.957
I know. Hold on.

11:53.959 --> 11:55.592
Hey, can you get
Andrew on the phone?

11:55.594 --> 11:57.034
I gotta talk about the...
I gotta go.

11:57.058 --> 11:59.492
Wait. Hey, come back. Come back!

12:06.504 --> 12:07.905
You yell at me in the hallway?

12:07.907 --> 12:09.673
Come back.

12:10.942 --> 12:13.043
What?

12:14.946 --> 12:22.019
Creason's rejecting the chemo
like they said she might.

12:23.988 --> 12:26.223
Okay. Well, what do we do?

12:26.225 --> 12:28.225
She's sad.

12:28.227 --> 12:30.928
You should probably
talk to her...

12:30.930 --> 12:33.464
Before they take
you off to prison.

12:45.243 --> 12:46.877
I have Angela on the phone...

12:46.879 --> 12:48.879
About the outreach program.

12:53.985 --> 12:55.219
What?

12:55.221 --> 12:58.055
What do they even have?
What do they got?

12:58.057 --> 13:02.626
Obstructing justice. Tampering.
You hijacked a market, too!

13:02.628 --> 13:04.061
Oh, that's a bunch of bullshit.

13:04.063 --> 13:07.564
Guy, I'd start
making preparations.

13:22.847 --> 13:26.149
I'm sorry about all this, Mr.
Clifton. Take care.

13:31.043 --> 13:32.723
<i>Announcer Clifton
manipulated the market...</i>

13:32.725 --> 13:34.258
<i>In an unprecedented fashion.</i>

13:34.260 --> 13:36.593
<i>This is all new in the
age of cyber warfare.</i>

13:36.595 --> 13:38.755
<i>I mean, he's an American who
infiltrated the markets.</i>

13:38.757 --> 13:40.637
<i>I think they'll have to
come down hard on him.</i>

13:40.639 --> 13:42.513
<i>I really do. They have
to set an example.</i>

13:42.515 --> 13:45.569
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

14:17.969 --> 14:19.303
<i>Schwab hello?</i>

14:19.305 --> 14:20.904
Hey, it's guy Clifton.

14:20.906 --> 14:22.272
<i>What can I do for you?</i>

14:28.713 --> 14:31.014
Look, I think I have a solution.

14:31.016 --> 14:34.952
I'm gonna need immunity.

14:53.705 --> 14:56.173
So, the attacks will hit
the computers that...

14:56.175 --> 14:57.975
Tabulate the trades
on all the markets.

15:00.111 --> 15:01.645
So we need to reroute
our markets...

15:01.647 --> 15:03.614
To another computer's server...

15:03.616 --> 15:05.082
One the hijackers
don't know about.

15:05.084 --> 15:07.684
This is what I'll create...
Build.

15:07.686 --> 15:09.019
Warm this up, please.

15:09.021 --> 15:11.288
So the hackers don't
know it exists.

15:11.290 --> 15:13.290
Is that possible?

15:15.727 --> 15:16.860
Is that possible?

15:16.862 --> 15:19.329
It's how he did it.

15:19.331 --> 15:20.897
How he did what?

15:20.899 --> 15:22.579
Well, he tried this before.
He attempted...

15:22.603 --> 15:23.634
Will it work?

15:23.636 --> 15:24.868
I mean, if it's worked before...
It didn't work.

15:24.870 --> 15:26.150
Support... gentlemen, excuse me.

15:26.174 --> 15:27.938
It's possible. It is possible.

15:27.940 --> 15:29.580
He attempted to do it,
but it didn't work.

15:29.604 --> 15:31.208
With your support...

15:31.210 --> 15:33.310
And my team, we will do it.

15:33.312 --> 15:36.813
Jeff, what he did is
not exactly legal.

15:36.815 --> 15:38.882
This can be ready for
the markets by Monday?

15:38.884 --> 15:42.019
Yeah, I just... I need
access to the server codes.

15:47.091 --> 15:50.427
So we're just gonna hand over
the keys to a market system.

15:50.429 --> 15:51.862
Give us a minute, guy.

15:51.864 --> 15:54.031
Sure.

15:54.033 --> 15:55.232
Thanks for your time.

16:02.140 --> 16:04.241
He's in the middle of a
major public indictment.

16:04.243 --> 16:06.176
He's the only one who
can do this, Richard.

16:07.412 --> 16:09.112
This happened in Hong Kong.

16:09.114 --> 16:10.947
The markets dropped
38% overnight...

16:10.949 --> 16:12.449
And next day they recovered.

16:12.451 --> 16:14.371
Right, but this is different.
I mean, there is...

16:14.395 --> 16:16.386
These cyber threats have
no lasting implications..

16:16.388 --> 16:18.021
On any market ever.

16:18.023 --> 16:19.823
This is different. You
know this is different.

16:19.825 --> 16:21.625
This is global. Jeff,
we've been through this.

16:21.649 --> 16:22.959
Is his personal life in order?

16:22.961 --> 16:25.762
Yes. He's good.

16:28.466 --> 16:29.766
Okay.

16:30.735 --> 16:32.135
Do me a favor.

16:32.137 --> 16:34.271
Let me bring bankruptcy
projections to Jeff.

16:34.273 --> 16:36.973
Runs on the goddamn bank.

16:36.975 --> 16:39.009
Respectfully, I don't work
for the goddamn bank.

16:39.011 --> 16:41.144
I work for the
goddamn white house.

16:45.717 --> 16:47.384
This has to work.

16:47.386 --> 16:49.386
I know.

16:49.388 --> 16:51.354
Then you should also know this.

16:51.356 --> 16:53.924
If it doesn't, they'll
pull your immunity.

16:55.093 --> 16:57.227
Assemble the team.

17:05.336 --> 17:07.369
I need you to talk to them.

17:07.372 --> 17:09.132
Well, yeah, 'cause they
all fucking hate you.

17:09.156 --> 17:11.074
Yeah, I know that.

17:11.076 --> 17:13.944
Well, if you know that, then
it's a non-starter, isn't it?

17:13.945 --> 17:15.377
What am I supposed
to tell my board?

17:15.380 --> 17:17.260
That I'm prancing around
collecting criminals...

17:17.284 --> 17:18.915
For guy Clifton's
latest project?

17:18.916 --> 17:21.050
I have a company
to run, too, guy.

17:21.053 --> 17:22.853
It's a non-profit.

17:22.855 --> 17:25.821
Did you really just
fucking say that?

17:25.824 --> 17:27.290
It's your daughter's non-profit.

17:27.291 --> 17:28.852
You know what you
should tell the board?

17:28.876 --> 17:29.493
What?

17:29.495 --> 17:32.362
That I get full immunity.

17:32.364 --> 17:35.832
So that our daughter
can have two parents.

17:43.541 --> 17:45.842
So, George, Amelia, who else?

17:45.844 --> 17:47.244
Ben?

17:47.246 --> 17:48.378
Ben.

17:48.380 --> 17:50.147
Oh, Jesus Christ.

17:50.149 --> 17:51.515
Yup.

17:58.957 --> 18:01.091
Ben just went dark on me.

18:03.795 --> 18:06.997
After you manipulated him into
hijacking an entire market.

18:06.999 --> 18:08.919
I don't know. Maybe I could
put some feelers out.

18:08.943 --> 18:10.000
I could...

18:10.002 --> 18:12.369
You know, I could probably
write this program myself.

18:12.371 --> 18:13.904
No, you can't.

18:13.906 --> 18:15.572
I can.

18:17.241 --> 18:19.042
I know where he is.

18:27.285 --> 18:28.451
Hi.

18:28.453 --> 18:29.820
Mrs. Clifton?

18:29.822 --> 18:31.454
Babe, who is it?

18:32.557 --> 18:34.457
Hey.

18:34.459 --> 18:36.226
Who is it?

18:36.228 --> 18:37.894
It's...

18:37.896 --> 18:39.029
It's your mother.

18:39.031 --> 18:41.164
What are you doing here?

18:41.166 --> 18:45.001
Well, I've got some
business with Ben.

18:45.003 --> 18:46.937
Business? Yes.

18:46.939 --> 18:49.072
I'll tell you about it later.

18:49.074 --> 18:51.441
Should I have told
you about this?

18:51.443 --> 18:53.376
Oh, I already knew about this.

18:58.583 --> 19:00.584
I'll take a shower.

19:00.586 --> 19:03.220
Okay? Okay.

19:16.868 --> 19:18.235
This is real.

19:18.237 --> 19:21.304
We're just taking
certain things slow.

19:21.306 --> 19:23.039
Oh, yes, I imagine she's
waiting to see...

19:23.041 --> 19:24.321
If you turn out like her father.

19:24.345 --> 19:25.942
She's still in high school.

19:25.944 --> 19:28.545
It's very mature of you
to recognize that.

19:28.547 --> 19:30.547
<i>Man for Ben...</i> Are you busy?

19:30.549 --> 19:31.989
Yes. <i>I'm calling
from chase collec...</i>

19:32.013 --> 19:34.017
Oh. With what?

19:34.019 --> 19:36.953
Coding. Algorithms. The usual.

19:36.955 --> 19:38.889
I've got a job for you.

19:38.891 --> 19:44.160
I... I don't think I'm cut out
for the non-profit sector.

19:44.162 --> 19:46.329
Really? It's a good job.
High six figures.

19:46.331 --> 19:48.465
Six figures? No.

19:48.467 --> 19:52.269
He's such a coward.

19:52.271 --> 19:55.138
Sending his wife up here
to recruit for him.

19:56.908 --> 19:58.441
He must be truly desperate.

19:58.443 --> 20:00.543
And you know you can't
trust a desperate man.

20:00.545 --> 20:05.115
He's not desperate, Ben. He's
sorry about what happened.

20:16.427 --> 20:18.495
I felt like Einstein.
You felt like Einstein?

20:18.497 --> 20:19.963
I felt like Einstein.

20:19.965 --> 20:22.565
I felt like I developed
this amazing thing.

20:22.567 --> 20:26.336
What do you mean, "turn
out like her father?"

20:26.338 --> 20:27.971
What?

20:27.973 --> 20:29.373
You said creason's
waiting to see...

20:29.397 --> 20:31.107
If I turn out like her father.

20:31.109 --> 20:34.077
The markets.

20:34.079 --> 20:37.547
It's all just fake
numbers and projections.

20:37.549 --> 20:41.318
It's hard to stay truthful
in a world like that.

20:41.320 --> 20:42.686
She doesn't want
me to be a trader.

20:42.688 --> 20:44.421
She doesn't want
you to be a liar.

20:51.696 --> 20:54.364
Will you do this job for me?

21:02.606 --> 21:04.007
How'd it go?

21:04.009 --> 21:05.575
Coward.

21:05.577 --> 21:08.545
What does that mean? Is he in?

21:08.547 --> 21:10.313
You lied to that poor boy.

21:10.315 --> 21:13.350
You made him hack the markets...
And he doesn't trust you.

21:13.352 --> 21:15.218
I didn't lie to anybody.

21:15.220 --> 21:18.121
My company created an algorithm.
He was an employee.

21:18.123 --> 21:20.490
He stole from me.

21:23.060 --> 21:25.028
Aw, fuck.

21:25.030 --> 21:26.730
Do I go talk to him?

21:26.732 --> 21:28.631
No. No?

21:30.034 --> 21:32.369
I'm gonna go talk to him.

21:32.371 --> 21:34.738
He's in, guy.

21:38.109 --> 21:41.578
Of course, he's in.
Of course, he's in.

21:41.580 --> 21:44.481
Your daughter also just had
sex with him upstairs.

21:46.150 --> 21:47.550
What?

21:49.788 --> 21:53.056
Do you even know how to
drive a fucking car?

21:53.058 --> 21:57.027
I need a barf bag like they
have in the airplanes.

21:57.029 --> 21:59.529
She's the nurse the
insurance company gave me.

21:59.531 --> 22:02.399
That's why she's retarded.
It wasn't my choice.

22:02.401 --> 22:03.533
Jesus, George, calm down.

22:03.535 --> 22:05.235
She fucking drives
like a maniac.

22:05.237 --> 22:07.637
She's trying to fucking kill me.
It's ridiculous.

22:07.639 --> 22:09.773
Crazy bitch. I missed you.

22:09.775 --> 22:13.610
This better be good.

22:13.612 --> 22:14.677
Who's this?

22:14.679 --> 22:16.246
Hey, George.

22:16.248 --> 22:18.648
Oh my god, look at
that hot piece of ass.

22:18.650 --> 22:22.519
Mm-mm... let's roll, nursie.

22:22.521 --> 22:24.387
Keep it up. Keep it up.

22:24.389 --> 22:26.823
Rolling. Rolling with my nursie.

22:26.825 --> 22:29.265
There's gonna be some boundaries
while we're here in my house.

22:29.289 --> 22:30.660
Yeah?

22:30.662 --> 22:31.761
Okay.

22:31.763 --> 22:33.129
Okay.

22:33.131 --> 22:35.231
Oh! Easy. I mean...

22:35.233 --> 22:36.666
You want a hand?

22:36.668 --> 22:38.501
Yeah, could somebody
help this thing in?

22:38.503 --> 22:40.070
All right, come on.

22:42.573 --> 22:44.841
These terrorists have
hijacked our central servers.

22:44.843 --> 22:47.477
So, George, you're gonna
repatch the markets...

22:47.479 --> 22:49.712
To a shadow server I
found in Iceland.

22:49.714 --> 22:51.815
Ben, you'll use the program
we already created...

22:51.817 --> 22:54.250
To distribute information
back to the traders...

22:54.252 --> 22:56.619
While Amelia monitors
market trends...

22:56.621 --> 22:59.489
And transactional process.

23:03.360 --> 23:04.727
Yes?

23:04.729 --> 23:08.298
I got a two part question.

23:08.300 --> 23:12.268
First, what happens
if we fail...

23:12.270 --> 23:16.272
And second part, what's gonna
happen to the rest of the world?

23:16.274 --> 23:17.540
We're not gonna fail.

23:17.542 --> 23:18.902
The rest of the
world will be fine.

23:18.926 --> 23:20.577
How can you be so sure?
You can guarantee?

23:20.579 --> 23:22.899
We're not gonna fail because...
This is nothing new for us.

23:22.923 --> 23:24.380
How can you be glib?

23:24.382 --> 23:26.216
Because... glib?

23:26.218 --> 23:28.518
I'm not glib. I trust you.
We can do this.

23:28.520 --> 23:29.686
We just need to focus.

23:29.688 --> 23:31.154
Hi.

23:31.156 --> 23:32.755
Hi. Hi.

23:33.824 --> 23:36.459
She got her mother's looks.

23:42.600 --> 23:45.160
I know you all hate me right now
for what I've put you through...

23:45.184 --> 23:46.269
And I don't blame you.

23:46.271 --> 23:48.271
But not a single one of you
would have showed up...

23:48.295 --> 23:50.140
If you didn't have
something to prove.

23:50.142 --> 23:53.843
So, George, we're
not going to fail.

23:53.845 --> 23:55.445
That's glib, my friend.

24:02.653 --> 24:04.754
I found the spot.
It's low-key, secure.

24:04.756 --> 24:06.222
I think it'll work just fine.

24:07.791 --> 24:10.393
We're gonna need
plausible deniability.

24:16.400 --> 24:18.668
It would be bad if you failed.

24:32.783 --> 24:35.351
<i>Guy the first thing
I want to do...</i>

24:35.353 --> 24:37.520
<i>Is route market observation
and analytics...</i>

24:37.522 --> 24:40.623
<i>Through the living room here.</i>

24:40.625 --> 24:42.425
<i>That's our control center.</i>

24:45.863 --> 24:47.730
Amelia. Yeah, I know.

24:47.732 --> 24:49.972
You're not gonna be monitoring
one market like last time.

24:49.996 --> 24:53.631
Every market. Every market.

24:58.909 --> 25:00.677
I feel like you're
secretly happy...

25:00.679 --> 25:02.345
That I'm back in the house.

25:02.347 --> 25:04.514
I don't think you should
use the word happy.

25:07.618 --> 25:10.920
Guys, the floors! Guys!

25:10.922 --> 25:13.489
$80 a square foot. Please.

25:13.491 --> 25:15.225
What the fuck's going on?

25:15.227 --> 25:16.859
What?

25:16.861 --> 25:19.562
Are they gonna zip tie these
cables and hug 'em to the walls?

25:19.564 --> 25:22.632
Yeah, guys, guys, let's
zip tie these cables...

25:22.634 --> 25:24.701
Hug 'em to the walls.

25:24.703 --> 25:28.571
George, I'm gonna put you
upstairs next to creason's room.

25:28.573 --> 25:30.306
It'll be easiest to
route the network...

25:30.308 --> 25:31.307
Through the window up there.

25:31.309 --> 25:34.577
Guy, are you serious? Shit.

25:34.579 --> 25:38.281
What? I can't climb stairs.

25:40.451 --> 25:42.685
If I get up there
and find out...

25:42.687 --> 25:47.290
You're in my wheelchair again,
so help me fucking god!

25:47.292 --> 25:49.859
Hurry, hurry, it's
not arts and crafts.

25:49.861 --> 25:53.263
So, Hong Kong on tech
3, 4 on board 1.

25:53.265 --> 25:54.797
And then we're gonna
do Philadelphia.

25:54.799 --> 26:00.036
Euro. Amsterdam. Let's
do Amsterdam 2, 1.

26:00.038 --> 26:03.473
I said... I said 4, 4.

26:03.475 --> 26:04.507
You said 3, 4.

26:04.509 --> 26:06.776
No, I said 4, 4.

26:06.778 --> 26:08.945
No, you didn't.
Yeah, yeah, I did.

26:08.947 --> 26:10.546
All right.

26:17.655 --> 26:20.823
No? All right.

26:20.825 --> 26:23.426
You don't got... you don't got
to be such a bitch about it.

26:23.428 --> 26:25.028
Come on.

26:25.030 --> 26:27.964
Let's repatch this and
then let's get to London.

26:27.966 --> 26:29.699
London on 2, 3.

26:31.835 --> 26:34.771
That leaves one open
room for you, Ben.

26:34.773 --> 26:38.608
The closet in my room.
It'll be nice and cozy.

26:38.610 --> 26:40.076
Plenty of solitary focus...

26:40.078 --> 26:42.679
For you to work out all
the programming kinks.

26:49.520 --> 26:51.020
Oh, hey.

26:51.022 --> 26:52.955
I think my mother's
closet really suits you.

26:52.957 --> 26:54.657
This is ridiculous.

27:10.741 --> 27:12.442
This status report is
being delivered...

27:12.444 --> 27:13.810
To the white house as we speak.

27:13.812 --> 27:16.512
Clifton and his team are
running a diagnostic test.

27:16.514 --> 27:18.514
A rehearsal, so to speak,
to work out the kinks.

27:18.516 --> 27:20.350
This should last between
6 and 8 hours...

27:20.352 --> 27:22.032
At which point they'll
be ready for market.

27:22.056 --> 27:25.722
I've advised the white house
to prepare two speeches...

27:25.724 --> 27:27.757
For the president to
address both outcomes.

27:27.759 --> 27:30.526
But I have every confidence
Clifton will succeed.

27:30.528 --> 27:33.863
<i>Automated voice
identification confirmed.</i>

27:33.865 --> 27:36.733
<i>Patching you into the house
right now, Ms. schwab.</i>

27:38.135 --> 27:41.371
Initiating the
market simulation.

27:41.373 --> 27:45.074
Time to test this bad boy.

27:45.076 --> 27:47.610
Ben, I'm sending you the
London to New York stuff now.

27:47.612 --> 27:50.513
My price movements lagging
by maybe 15 minutes.

27:50.515 --> 27:52.782
George, let's add Miami.

27:52.784 --> 27:57.787
We have too many main market
patches running on board 2.

27:57.789 --> 28:00.590
Retard, this is board 1
and this is board 2.

28:00.592 --> 28:01.991
Come on, get with me, nurse.

28:01.993 --> 28:03.126
You want to do it yourself?

28:03.128 --> 28:05.628
That's what she said.

28:05.630 --> 28:08.564
<i>Let's add Miami to the
diagnostic, please.</i>

28:08.566 --> 28:12.435
<i>Initiating Miami simulation now.</i>

28:12.437 --> 28:16.873
What are we waiting for?
There it is.

28:16.875 --> 28:19.142
<i>Can I get an update on
the price movements?</i>

28:19.144 --> 28:22.044
All right, we got major
spikes of activity in...

28:22.046 --> 28:25.415
C-bot, Amsterdam and Atlanta.

28:25.417 --> 28:27.550
George, let's get a status update.
George.

28:27.552 --> 28:29.051
Hey. Hello? Hello!

28:29.053 --> 28:30.153
Hello, I'm not doing this
for my health, okay?

28:30.155 --> 28:31.854
Jesus, I can hear you upstairs.

28:31.856 --> 28:33.656
I need to talk to people.

28:33.658 --> 28:35.425
Try pressing the button
on the walkie-talkie.

28:35.427 --> 28:37.107
Okay, we got major
spikes in activity in...

28:37.131 --> 28:40.129
Amsterdam, c-bot and Atlanta.

28:40.131 --> 28:43.099
Let's try rerouting a
couple of things, then.

28:56.713 --> 29:00.483
Oh, shit. Yeah.

29:00.485 --> 29:03.453
We don't have servers.
Hey, we got a problem.

29:03.455 --> 29:06.489
I mean, this is
fucking ridiculous.

29:06.491 --> 29:08.451
You got me working upstairs
in your wife's closet?

29:08.475 --> 29:11.527
Hey, what's the issue? You shut the...
nothing.

29:11.529 --> 29:14.197
You're under surveillance.
This is what this looks like.

29:14.199 --> 29:16.199
You stay the fuck away
from my daughter.

29:16.201 --> 29:17.800
We don't have a
server big enough.

29:17.802 --> 29:19.135
What about Amazon?

29:19.137 --> 29:21.237
We can't find a
server big enough.

29:21.939 --> 29:24.907
We need 5% of the Internet.
The fastest 5%.

29:24.909 --> 29:26.676
Zero latency bandwidth.

29:28.212 --> 29:31.147
We need Facebook or netflix.

29:31.149 --> 29:32.849
It's just not gonna work.
This is bullshit.

29:32.851 --> 29:34.811
Unless somebody has a really
big fucking server...

29:34.835 --> 29:35.952
That I don't know about.

29:35.954 --> 29:37.653
I don't like this bullshit as
much as you don't like it.

29:37.655 --> 29:38.654
It's a control kick.

29:38.656 --> 29:39.922
Wait. Wait.

29:39.924 --> 29:42.191
Control kick, my friend,
this is my daughter.

29:42.193 --> 29:44.026
Probably. Excuse me?

29:44.028 --> 29:45.561
<i>We have a server.</i>

29:49.933 --> 29:51.968
We have a server.

30:15.158 --> 30:16.959
Oh, my gosh.

30:16.961 --> 30:18.060
This is it?

30:18.062 --> 30:19.729
Yup, this is it.

30:19.731 --> 30:22.765
This is our post-9/11
backup shadow stock market.

30:22.767 --> 30:25.268
In a tug boat. I know.

30:25.270 --> 30:28.804
What is this? What
is this thing here?

30:28.806 --> 30:30.139
Where's the server?

30:30.141 --> 30:33.943
That's the server.
Over that barge.

30:33.945 --> 30:35.645
It's all mobile.

30:43.153 --> 30:46.722
We moved it every 3 to
5 days for security.

30:46.724 --> 30:49.892
What can I say, it worked for
Saddam, until it didn't.

30:49.894 --> 30:51.961
And it's all nuclear-powered.

30:51.963 --> 30:53.829
And the only reason
it's still here...

30:53.831 --> 30:55.831
Is we haven't figured out
how to dispose of it yet.

30:55.855 --> 30:57.066
Oh, that's comforting.

30:57.068 --> 30:59.228
Yeah, we cautioned the bush
administration that this...

30:59.252 --> 31:01.971
Unit would be shut down even
before they ever tested it.

31:01.973 --> 31:06.842
But no one likes to listen to
what no one wants to hear.

31:06.844 --> 31:08.277
Listen to what?

31:08.279 --> 31:09.946
That the banks...

31:09.948 --> 31:12.582
Would create their own
backup systems privately.

31:12.584 --> 31:15.818
I mean, who do you trust
less than government?

31:15.820 --> 31:18.020
Oh, I don't know. Banks?

31:22.292 --> 31:26.162
Back-end server codes. Have fun.

31:26.164 --> 31:28.831
Well went dry on messengers?

31:28.833 --> 31:31.767
Using highly classified
server codes...

31:31.769 --> 31:33.703
To rewire the American
market system...

31:33.705 --> 31:36.739
Isn't exactly a small thing.

31:36.741 --> 31:41.644
And it would be negligent
of me not to stay informed.

31:53.357 --> 31:55.124
Yeah.

31:55.126 --> 31:58.361
You hacked the nasdaq and the
New York stock exchange.

31:58.363 --> 32:00.329
He doesn't like that word.
I don't like that word.

32:00.331 --> 32:02.164
See if you can get George to
patch this back to the house.

32:02.166 --> 32:04.100
You held them for 11 hours.
And a half.

32:04.102 --> 32:06.836
See if you can get George to
patch this back to the house.

32:06.838 --> 32:08.798
You held nasdaq and the New
York stock exchange...

32:08.822 --> 32:10.373
For 11 and a half hours.

32:10.375 --> 32:12.074
What happened?
Something went wrong.

32:12.076 --> 32:13.396
Was it with the
program you wrote?

32:13.420 --> 32:14.677
Guy didn't write the program.

32:14.679 --> 32:15.878
I developed the program.

32:15.880 --> 32:17.179
You didn't develop it, either.

32:17.181 --> 32:21.250
Guy? Guy?

32:21.252 --> 32:22.418
Sarah.

32:22.420 --> 32:24.920
Who wrote the program?

32:24.922 --> 32:26.088
Who wrote the program?

32:26.090 --> 32:27.757
Who wrote the program
is irrelevant.

32:27.759 --> 32:29.925
What went wrong, guy?

32:29.927 --> 32:32.762
You went wrong, Ben.
You went wrong.

32:32.764 --> 32:34.730
So I never should have
asked you to do this.

32:34.732 --> 32:37.013
You didn't ask me, you fucking coward.
Your wife asked me.

32:37.037 --> 32:38.901
Fuck you. Fuck you.

32:38.903 --> 32:43.406
You've been thinking about this
every waking goddamn second.

32:43.408 --> 32:45.041
I was so close to
the finish line.

32:45.043 --> 32:47.443
So close we could touch it.
Close to what?

32:47.445 --> 32:49.311
Hacking our way to the top?

32:49.313 --> 32:51.473
It doesn't matter how you get
to the mountain top, son.

32:51.497 --> 32:55.051
You either make it or you don't.
We were there. We were there.

32:55.053 --> 32:56.493
I used to believe
what you would say.

32:56.517 --> 32:58.054
Stop with this...

32:58.056 --> 33:00.289
"I could have been a contender"
bullshit, all right?

33:00.291 --> 33:03.059
You're a fucking criminal
and you can live with that.

33:14.204 --> 33:18.374
Ben wrote the program.
Then he pulled the plug.

33:19.743 --> 33:21.944
Why?

33:24.915 --> 33:27.349
It was the right thing to do.

33:59.182 --> 34:00.983
How are we going to handle this?

34:16.132 --> 34:17.533
Handle what?

34:17.534 --> 34:19.835
Handle creason.

34:21.237 --> 34:23.505
How are we going
to handle creason?

34:25.041 --> 34:26.909
She just can't carry
on with this stuff.

34:26.911 --> 34:30.045
She's 18. He's 25.
I'll just forbid it.

34:30.047 --> 34:31.781
You'll forbid it? Yes.

34:31.783 --> 34:33.415
Why? 'Cause it's
what's best for her?

34:33.417 --> 34:36.252
Oh, don't be so dramatic.
This isn't about her.

34:36.254 --> 34:38.888
Punish your daughter because
Ben has a moral compass?

34:38.889 --> 34:41.456
Oh, obviously not a
sexual moral compass.

34:41.458 --> 34:43.559
You know what I mean.

34:43.561 --> 34:45.860
She can't see him anymore.
Period!

34:45.862 --> 34:47.929
You have no idea
what he did to me.

34:47.931 --> 34:51.199
He pulled a power play
that day to fuck me.

34:51.202 --> 34:53.435
He's having sex with our
daughter to fuck me.

34:53.437 --> 34:57.072
I don't know why he pulled the
plug, but Ben was doing...

34:57.074 --> 34:59.408
The right thing, guy,
and you know that.

34:59.410 --> 35:01.977
Have you even talked
to him about it?

35:02.879 --> 35:04.513
Fuck him. Guy!

35:04.515 --> 35:06.595
I can't. I'm not talking...
You are better than this.

35:10.954 --> 35:13.823
You will not deny her
this experience.

35:31.174 --> 35:33.175
Ben, you got a sec?

35:33.177 --> 35:35.344
<i>Ben what's up?</i>

35:35.346 --> 35:37.012
Look, the board's not
going to approve...

35:37.014 --> 35:38.547
This acquisition next week...

35:38.549 --> 35:42.218
Unless we can prove we're
worth the risk. Okay?

35:42.220 --> 35:46.422
The company's valuation needs
to be presented differently.

35:46.424 --> 35:49.158
I'd like to use the
computer program you wrote.

35:53.864 --> 35:56.932
<i>Ben we need a team
to hack the market.</i>

35:56.934 --> 35:58.934
<i>It's a grey area.</i>

35:58.936 --> 36:01.337
<i>You should have legal
look into it first.</i>

36:41.011 --> 36:43.178
It's gonna be different soon.

36:52.689 --> 36:58.360
What do you think she'll say
when daddy saves the world?

36:58.362 --> 37:00.663
She'll wonder why you didn't
come home for dinner.

37:19.416 --> 37:21.350
<i>Announcer all non-military...</i>

37:21.352 --> 37:25.621
<i>Non-essential personnel
please clear the premise.</i>

37:25.623 --> 37:30.492
<i>I repeat: All non-military,
non-essential personnel...</i>

37:30.494 --> 37:33.395
<i>Please clear the premise.</i>

38:01.157 --> 38:04.593
And we have every market
running the diagnostic.

38:04.595 --> 38:06.996
It needs to cycle through
a few simulations.

38:06.998 --> 38:08.764
Looks like it's working.

38:08.766 --> 38:10.699
I'm going to take a
break for a while.

38:16.306 --> 38:17.773
Well, what does that mean?

38:17.775 --> 38:19.641
But... I mean, if
it's unresponsive...

38:25.615 --> 38:29.018
Well, do we up the dosage?
I mean, what do we do?

38:44.434 --> 38:47.202
Well, we'll talk about it
when we come in. Okay.

38:49.272 --> 38:50.572
What's up?

38:50.574 --> 38:52.808
Hi. You okay?

38:52.810 --> 38:54.810
Yeah, I'm fine.

38:54.812 --> 38:57.079
It sounded like it
was about creason.

38:57.081 --> 38:59.515
It was.

38:59.517 --> 39:03.352
And? Are you asking?

39:03.354 --> 39:06.255
'Cause if you're asking, you
need to say something like...

39:06.257 --> 39:09.425
"Shannon, what's
happening with creason?"

39:09.427 --> 39:11.193
Or "Shannon, will
you loop me in..."

39:11.195 --> 39:12.515
With what the doctors
are saying?"

39:12.539 --> 39:14.496
So will you... Say,
"can I help you?"

39:14.498 --> 39:17.566
Okay. Yeah, I can.
Shannon, loop me in...

39:17.568 --> 39:19.101
With what the
doctors are saying.

39:19.103 --> 39:20.536
I want to help you.

39:20.538 --> 39:23.205
It's fine. I can do it. Okay.

39:23.207 --> 39:25.541
Okay. Okay.

39:31.614 --> 39:33.649
It's gonna be okay. It's okay.

39:33.651 --> 39:36.118
Okay.

39:50.166 --> 39:54.136
Guy was the first one
to take a chance on me.

39:54.138 --> 39:55.978
All the boys on the floor
used to look at me...

39:56.002 --> 39:58.874
Like I was such a tight ass.

39:58.876 --> 40:06.381
And you know, he made
a mistake, but...

40:06.383 --> 40:08.484
It was just a mistake.

40:08.486 --> 40:09.885
I don't even like this stuff.

40:09.887 --> 40:13.589
And I could be so much
richer, but I am not.

40:13.591 --> 40:16.658
Well, I'm flat broke.

40:30.573 --> 40:33.408
Sing that thing.

40:33.410 --> 40:35.177
What thing?

40:35.179 --> 40:36.678
That thing you sing. No.

40:36.680 --> 40:39.915
Sing it. Sing it. It's late.

40:57.735 --> 40:58.934
Be. Hit the note. Be.

40:58.936 --> 41:00.836
Be. Be.

41:20.291 --> 41:22.357
Go back to sleep.

41:25.728 --> 41:28.864
How come the FBI hasn't just...

41:28.866 --> 41:33.602
Back traced any short
sales to November 15th...

41:33.604 --> 41:37.539
Because then you could just, you
know, you could trace it to...

41:37.541 --> 41:40.742
Shit, the...

41:40.744 --> 41:43.512
Terrorists. Yes.

41:43.514 --> 41:45.447
Thank you. The terrorists.

41:45.449 --> 41:47.849
And then who knows?

41:47.851 --> 41:49.351
Right, who knows?

41:49.353 --> 41:52.554
You're more than just a patcher.

41:52.556 --> 41:54.756
You know what I'm gonna do?
What?

41:54.758 --> 41:56.658
I'm gonna pull a bin laden.

41:56.660 --> 41:58.627
Oh, yeah, you remember that?

41:58.629 --> 42:01.730
The family sold all
their stocks...

42:01.732 --> 42:05.500
'Cause they knew the market
was gonna crash before 9/11.

42:05.502 --> 42:09.738
So they short sold all their
united airlines stock...

42:09.740 --> 42:11.840
The night before.

42:11.842 --> 42:14.610
The night before.

42:14.612 --> 42:17.846
They made a fortune.

42:17.848 --> 42:21.817
It'd be the first time I
ever made money on a trade.

42:21.819 --> 42:23.685
You know?

42:23.687 --> 42:25.687
That's an insider trade, George.

42:25.689 --> 42:30.692
'Cause you could just
trace it to them.

42:30.694 --> 42:34.296
To the, um...

42:34.298 --> 42:35.998
Terrorists. Yeah,
to the terrorists.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.699
Thank you very much.

42:43.439 --> 42:45.874
Hey, I'm... I'm sorry.

42:45.876 --> 42:49.678
Nice chatting with you.

42:55.819 --> 43:00.389
<i>Female agent Jimmy,
front entrance clear?</i>

43:00.391 --> 43:02.424
<i>Do you copy?</i>

43:02.426 --> 43:04.660
I know, I said I'd just...

43:04.662 --> 43:07.429
George took longer than
usual tonight, so.

43:11.668 --> 43:15.437
Why would someone
hack the markets?

43:38.461 --> 43:41.363
Oh, shit. Shit.

43:41.365 --> 43:43.532
Shit, shit, shit.

43:58.614 --> 44:01.950
Yeah? What?

44:02.985 --> 44:04.786
Yeah.

44:07.523 --> 44:12.461
I... I know that, but I
told you that I'm working.

44:12.463 --> 44:14.796
I don't know what day I get off.

44:14.798 --> 44:16.698
What's going on?

44:19.001 --> 44:20.569
God, you look like shit.

44:20.571 --> 44:22.003
I took a little nap.

44:22.005 --> 44:26.441
You gotta look at this.
Look at that.

44:26.443 --> 44:29.478
Look, I had a late
night with Amelia.

44:29.480 --> 44:31.280
What am I looking at?
Something big came up...

44:31.304 --> 44:32.547
So to speak.

44:32.549 --> 44:34.883
All right, George. Where're
you going with this, man?

44:34.885 --> 44:37.619
Okay, okay... the markets
are the target, right?

44:37.621 --> 44:39.421
Right.

44:39.423 --> 44:42.758
So why wouldn't the terrorists
be playing the market?

44:42.760 --> 44:48.063
Okay. So I traced all the short
sales from the 14th to the 16th.

44:48.065 --> 44:50.399
You know, the usual
suspects came up.

44:50.401 --> 44:51.967
You know, you got China.
You got Iran.

44:51.969 --> 44:53.735
You got... i got it.

44:53.737 --> 44:55.537
You got... okay,
and I got nothing.

44:55.539 --> 44:57.005
Okay. Okay. Okay. I gotcha.

44:57.007 --> 44:59.808
And then I traced all the
American companies...

44:59.810 --> 45:04.446
And I got all these
portfolios...

45:04.448 --> 45:06.648
Owned and operated
by the big boys.

45:06.650 --> 45:10.752
Hey, look at this, look at this.
Take a look right there.

45:10.754 --> 45:14.122
Jp Morgan, Wells Fargo,
assured technologies.

45:14.124 --> 45:16.658
Is that b of a? Mm-hm.

45:16.660 --> 45:19.995
Commodities. All right, they all
look like normal trends, though.

45:19.997 --> 45:21.763
Yeah, yeah, they're short...

45:21.765 --> 45:23.632
But they're shorting everything
they can, you see that?

45:23.634 --> 45:25.133
I know, I know, but they're
legit trading patterns.

45:25.135 --> 45:26.615
You know, one bank
starts, they all...

45:26.639 --> 45:27.869
Yeah, yeah, but...

45:27.871 --> 45:29.471
They're all following
normal trends.

45:29.473 --> 45:32.908
Okay, so why isn't
Goldman sachs there?

45:32.910 --> 45:37.712
Huh? Why isn't Goldman
sachs doing anything? Why?

45:37.714 --> 45:40.816
The banks were all
bailed out by the fed...

45:40.818 --> 45:43.518
In '08 after the crash.

45:43.520 --> 45:49.090
But Goldman paid it
back April 14th, '09.

45:49.092 --> 45:51.126
Okay?

45:51.128 --> 45:55.597
The only company shorting on
the day of the cyber-attack...

45:55.599 --> 45:58.099
Are the companies that
the fed bailed out...

45:58.101 --> 46:01.470
And has total control over
their managing interests.

46:01.472 --> 46:02.871
George, are you sure about this?

46:02.873 --> 46:06.475
The fed doesn't have
controlling interest...

46:06.477 --> 46:08.610
In Goldman sachs
and it never did.

46:09.679 --> 46:11.613
Holy shit. I swear to god.

46:11.615 --> 46:13.648
The federal reserve is
orchestrating the largest...

46:13.650 --> 46:17.118
Insider trade of all time.

46:19.889 --> 46:22.257
<i>Del banco the banks
work for the people...</i>

46:22.259 --> 46:25.560
<i>And I am here to
insure the people...</i>

46:25.562 --> 46:27.762
<i>To continue their
belief in the banks.</i>

46:27.764 --> 46:29.698
<i>I accept the president's
nomination.</i>

46:29.700 --> 46:31.233
<i>I accept the post...</i>

46:31.235 --> 46:33.935
<i>As 16th chairman of
the federal reserve.</i>

46:35.872 --> 46:38.139
Oh, I love it here, boys.

46:38.141 --> 46:42.511
Money, power and the circus.

46:44.847 --> 46:46.915
Always wanted to
be the ringleader.

46:46.917 --> 46:50.785
And here I am... whoo!

46:50.787 --> 46:52.754
Mr. del banco. Yes.

46:52.756 --> 46:55.690
We've spoken amongst
ourselves and...

46:55.692 --> 46:57.332
We can't loan the people
any more money...

46:57.356 --> 47:00.228
Without some incentives.

47:00.230 --> 47:04.599
The bank needs incentive
to do their jobs?

47:04.601 --> 47:07.035
In '08, you gave
us $800 billion.

47:07.037 --> 47:09.004
Maybe we start there.

47:09.006 --> 47:12.641
I'm gonna stop you right there, bill.
We've been cut off.

47:12.643 --> 47:15.610
She ran her campaign
on accountability.

47:15.612 --> 47:17.779
So no more blank
checks to the banks.

47:17.781 --> 47:19.581
We are the five largest
investment banks...

47:19.583 --> 47:21.082
In the western hemisphere.

47:21.084 --> 47:24.219
The federal reserve was created
to serve our interests...

47:24.221 --> 47:26.121
Not the current
flavor of the week.

47:26.123 --> 47:28.189
Madame president will be...
To be fair...

47:28.191 --> 47:31.726
Goldman sachs doesn't come
to these meetings anymore.

47:31.728 --> 47:35.564
So I'm looking at four of the
five largest investment banks.

47:35.566 --> 47:37.766
Richard, give us our money.

47:37.768 --> 47:40.602
She wants to cut a check
to the people instead.

47:40.604 --> 47:43.305
The people are too stupid
to know how to spend it.

47:43.307 --> 47:45.006
Bill, we're on the same page.

47:45.008 --> 47:47.342
I took an oath to protect
the financial system...

47:47.344 --> 47:50.178
And I'm sure as hell not gonna
let the people control things.

47:50.180 --> 47:51.947
Then what are we gonna do?

47:51.949 --> 47:54.883
I've got a plan.

47:54.885 --> 47:58.086
The fed tipped off the
banks two days before...

47:58.088 --> 48:01.623
Even the FBI knew
about the threats.

48:01.625 --> 48:07.762
They're the ones behind
the attack, man.

48:07.764 --> 48:10.932
We lead the people to a
point of complete panic.

48:10.934 --> 48:13.969
Then we rein it all back in.

48:13.971 --> 48:16.338
This is where the markets
will be Monday morning...

48:16.340 --> 48:18.673
Opening bell before the attack.

48:18.675 --> 48:23.812
These are the markets
at the end of that day.

48:23.814 --> 48:25.647
Your banks will
sell your assets...

48:25.649 --> 48:29.250
A couple of days before the
attack, at the peak up here...

48:29.252 --> 48:35.690
Then buy them back down here
for a fraction of the amount.

48:36.759 --> 48:39.294
Next day, the market rebounds...

48:39.296 --> 48:43.398
And all those stocks that you
bought for nothing are worth...

48:43.400 --> 48:48.370
Well, billions.

48:48.372 --> 48:51.172
We've never had a fed
chairman like you.

48:51.174 --> 48:53.141
No, you haven't.

48:53.143 --> 48:55.143
But this is all possible?

48:55.145 --> 48:58.813
With the right man on the
inside, anything's possible.

49:01.651 --> 49:05.220
We're being sabotaged, schwab.
We need to meet... now.

49:05.222 --> 49:06.822
<i>Schwab what are you
talking about, guy?</i>

49:06.846 --> 49:08.056
<i>I'm in D.C.</i>

49:08.058 --> 49:10.892
Yeah? Well, find a plane,
it's a 2-hour flight.

49:16.699 --> 49:19.300
This is about so much
more than just money.

49:25.274 --> 49:27.242
Now, we won't be able to
catch him in the act...

49:27.244 --> 49:29.110
Without your help.

49:29.112 --> 49:32.914
He will lie to you and tell you
it's all for some greater good.

49:38.788 --> 49:41.389
<i>Pilot big top on final
approach at 12,000 feet.</i>

49:44.994 --> 49:49.698
He will come to your house.
He will use you.

49:49.700 --> 49:51.166
Use you.

49:54.136 --> 49:57.939
To help him hijack the markets.

50:11.020 --> 50:13.922
You don't want to be used again.

50:15.925 --> 50:18.059
There's a hypothesis at best.

50:18.061 --> 50:20.095
So what if Goldman
isn't shorting.

50:20.097 --> 50:22.130
All that proves is they're
still the smartest.

50:22.132 --> 50:23.798
Market cap is 18 trillion.

50:23.800 --> 50:25.767
The banks are short
8 fucking trillion.

50:25.769 --> 50:28.269
Goldman hasn't
made a move, okay?

50:28.271 --> 50:30.171
Help me out here.

50:30.173 --> 50:33.842
Help you out. Christ.
We think...

50:33.844 --> 50:35.410
This isn't exactly
the optimal time...

50:35.412 --> 50:37.045
To play conspiracy
theory, by the way.

50:37.047 --> 50:39.013
This isn't a theory.
This is a fact.

50:39.015 --> 50:40.782
It's a fact? Yeah!

50:40.784 --> 50:42.904
This is them rewriting the rules.
Same as it ever was.

50:42.906 --> 50:45.607
The housing collapse, student
loans, the great depression...

50:45.609 --> 50:46.855
Iraq.

50:46.857 --> 50:49.290
You and I both know the
fed is behind everything.

50:49.292 --> 50:52.327
Ben, do the right thing.

50:58.134 --> 50:59.768
You can't seriously
be thinking...

50:59.770 --> 51:01.410
About keeping these
markets live tomorrow.

51:01.434 --> 51:04.636
You gotta sort this out. You
gotta freeze everything.

51:06.942 --> 51:08.843
Who else knows about this?

51:10.112 --> 51:11.846
Nobody.

51:11.848 --> 51:14.783
They're the most dangerous.
The most powerful.

51:14.785 --> 51:17.418
Guy, who else knows about this?

51:17.420 --> 51:19.420
No one.

51:23.025 --> 51:24.459
What's this?

51:27.163 --> 51:29.531
You want to stay a free man?

51:29.533 --> 51:32.400
All we talked about
here is baseball.

51:37.106 --> 51:38.540
What do you say?

51:40.399 --> 51:42.378
<i>Operator white house operator.</i>

51:42.379 --> 51:45.213
<i>Schwab yes, I need Jeff
on his secure line.</i>

51:45.215 --> 51:47.081
<i>This is Sarah schwab.</i>

51:50.419 --> 51:52.353
<i>Jeff hello?</i>

51:52.355 --> 51:54.195
<i>Schwab I want you to know
I'll be handing in...</i>

51:54.219 --> 51:55.924
<i>My letter of resignation
tomorrow morning.</i>

51:55.926 --> 51:57.526
<i>Jeff Sarah, what are
you talking about?</i>

51:57.550 --> 51:58.960
<i>Schwab I'm sorry.</i>

51:58.962 --> 52:00.282
<i>This isn't what I signed up for.</i>

52:00.306 --> 52:01.506
<i>The system's entirely fucked.</i>

52:04.067 --> 52:05.427
Is it okay if we
talk for a minute?

52:05.451 --> 52:08.252
Yeah. Is everything okay?

52:20.282 --> 52:22.283
Just say it.

52:22.285 --> 52:26.321
I don't know what's going
to happen tomorrow.

52:26.323 --> 52:30.058
Something... there's
something i need...

52:30.060 --> 52:32.427
When we started dating,
you told me how...

52:32.429 --> 52:35.964
Complicated things might become.

52:35.966 --> 52:38.233
I only came back to do
this because of you.

52:38.235 --> 52:41.236
But I don't know if those
were the right reasons.

52:41.238 --> 52:43.504
What?

53:00.890 --> 53:03.057
What are you doing?
It's 4:00 A.M.

53:16.939 --> 53:20.008
I never wanted to be a cheater.

53:20.010 --> 53:22.210
I know.

53:22.212 --> 53:25.346
Just never enough. I wanted
more, I needed more and more.

53:25.348 --> 53:27.949
You know how I would
always say...

53:30.185 --> 53:33.588
I'm doing this for you and for
creason to make you happy...

53:33.590 --> 53:37.558
Make you comfortable?

53:37.560 --> 53:39.661
I couldn't stop, Shannon,
i couldn't stop.

53:44.199 --> 53:47.201
I'm afraid.

53:47.203 --> 53:51.005
I'm scared.

53:51.007 --> 53:53.641
I'm fucking scared and I don't
know what's gonna happen.

53:53.643 --> 53:55.283
I don't know what's
gonna happen tomorrow.

53:55.307 --> 53:58.012
Oh, would you knock it off!

53:58.014 --> 53:59.981
No one knows what's
gonna happen tomorrow.

53:59.983 --> 54:02.116
I don't know what's
gonna happen tomorrow.

54:02.118 --> 54:04.652
You made a mistake, you fix it.

54:04.654 --> 54:08.189
It's what you're gonna do tomorrow.
You're gonna fix it.

54:08.191 --> 54:09.624
This is different. Oh.

54:09.626 --> 54:11.106
This is different.
It's not different!

54:11.130 --> 54:12.694
It's not different! It's not!

54:12.696 --> 54:14.062
You always say it's different.
It's not different.

54:14.064 --> 54:15.363
It's the same thing.

54:15.365 --> 54:16.731
When you started your business.

54:16.733 --> 54:18.232
When you hijacked the market.

54:18.234 --> 54:20.668
When you got caught.

54:20.670 --> 54:24.138
It's not the... we're
all still here!

54:28.644 --> 54:31.179
Everything okay?

54:31.181 --> 54:32.647
Yeah.

54:34.683 --> 54:36.584
Mom threw a book at me.

54:36.586 --> 54:40.154
Yeah, just a paperback.
I'm sorry.

54:40.156 --> 54:42.423
It's okay.

54:45.527 --> 54:47.095
Okay.

54:48.263 --> 54:50.732
You okay?

54:52.368 --> 54:54.135
He broke up with me.

54:55.537 --> 54:58.239
Nah. You know... okay?

55:01.176 --> 55:03.144
He broke up with me.

55:03.146 --> 55:04.645
Okay, okay, okay. Daddy...
no, no.

55:04.647 --> 55:07.782
Okay, okay. It's okay, baby.
Oh, sweetie pie.

55:10.486 --> 55:15.556
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Fucking Ben.

55:15.558 --> 55:18.226

It's just a boy.

55:24.267 --> 55:25.800
It's okay.

55:25.802 --> 55:27.468
But I loved him.

55:27.470 --> 55:32.407
No, no, you love me.
You love your daddy.

55:32.409 --> 55:35.777
Okay. Honey bunny.

55:35.779 --> 55:38.579

55:38.581 --> 55:41.315
Lots of boys.

56:17.219 --> 56:20.154
They're afraid, George.

56:20.156 --> 56:23.224
They're afraid of what might
happen if they lose the system.

56:27.129 --> 56:29.530
So what are we gonna do?

56:29.532 --> 56:33.534
We're gonna get through this.

56:33.536 --> 56:35.336
Are we?

56:44.513 --> 56:48.116
You boys ready to save
the fucking world?

56:48.118 --> 56:50.451

hop through the garden...

57:26.289 --> 57:29.657
Across the riverbed,
into the large hedge...

57:29.659 --> 57:32.627
Where he found a most
mysterious object.

57:32.629 --> 57:35.863
Now this object wasn't anything
the fox could describe...

57:35.865 --> 57:38.232

She sounded frightened.

58:02.659 --> 58:05.259
Then she just hung up.

58:07.629 --> 58:11.232
Well, I told you she

couldn't do it again...

hack the markets again.

Believe any of this?

On all banking activities.

01:07:03.299 --> 01:07:05.499
Why?

01:07:05.501 --> 01:07:11.071
Because your banks only hold 10%
cash deposit at any given time.

01:07:11.073 --> 01:07:13.140
That'll run out in
a matter of hours.

01:07:13.142 --> 01:07:16.343
You want the focus to
be on the markets...

01:07:16.345 --> 01:07:18.312
Not on bank vaults.

01:07:20.815 --> 01:07:22.775
Hey, chelsh, I still need
the depletion numbers...

01:07:22.799 --> 01:07:24.351
From Goldman, I don't
have those yet.

01:07:24.353 --> 01:07:24.351
<i>Chelsh they won't give
me the numbers, Sarah.</i>

01:07:24.353 --> 01:07:24.351
I'm the fucking treasury office.
What do you mean they won't...

01:07:24.353 --> 01:07:24.351
<i>Chelsh you're not the
treasury office anymore.</i>

01:07:24.353 --> 01:07:30.991
All right, look, call me back in five.
I gotta get this.

01:07:30.993 --> 01:07:30.991
Erin, what do you got?

01:07:30.993 --> 01:07:33.494
<i>Erin it's about the
European union.</i>

01:07:33.496 --> 01:07:35.295
What?

01:07:35.297 --> 01:07:38.098
<i>Erin they're freezing us out.</i>

01:08:02.357 --> 01:08:04.858
<i>Reporter I'm standing
outside parliament now...</i>

01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:07.261
<i>Where the prime minister has
called an emergency session...</i>

01:08:07.263 --> 01:08:09.863
<i>To discuss the financial
implications to...</i>

01:08:09.865 --> 01:08:11.745
<i>Reporter ♪2 large quantities
of money from</i> atms.

01:08:11.769 --> 01:08:13.834
<i>Some even closing out
their entire account...</i>

01:08:13.836 --> 01:08:17.270
<i>Fearing life savings
could be plundered.</i>

01:08:17.273 --> 01:08:19.973
Flashing red. We're
flashing red!

01:08:19.975 --> 01:08:21.774
No, no, we need to reloop
the nasdaq server...

01:08:21.799 --> 01:08:23.399
Through yellow
before you can boot.

01:08:25.881 --> 01:08:27.046
Yeah?

01:08:27.049 --> 01:08:28.282
Guy, listen to me.

01:08:28.283 --> 01:08:29.582
I fucking told you, schwab.

01:08:29.585 --> 01:08:31.084
Guy, listen!

01:08:31.086 --> 01:08:32.319
What?

01:08:34.956 --> 01:08:36.423
They're running the banks, guy.

01:08:36.425 --> 01:08:38.524
It wasn't supposed
to happen this fast.

01:08:38.527 --> 01:08:41.094
It started here, then
London, then Hong Kong.

01:08:41.095 --> 01:08:43.263
They're running our banks
from every city in the world.

01:08:43.265 --> 01:08:45.098
It's like fucking dominoes.

01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:49.203
Are you close? Please
tell me you're close.

01:08:49.205 --> 01:08:51.004
Guy?

01:08:51.006 --> 01:08:52.506
Am I close to what?

01:08:52.508 --> 01:08:54.468
Okay, if you could pull the
markets back online...

01:08:54.492 --> 01:08:57.877
We can... we can call it a market
glitch or an algorithm failure.

01:08:57.880 --> 01:08:59.179
We can calm everybody down.

01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:01.348
You want me to save
the banks, schwab?

01:09:01.350 --> 01:09:03.951
I'm not asking you to
save the banks, guy.

01:09:03.953 --> 01:09:08.488
I'm asking you to restore
some faith in the system.

01:09:08.490 --> 01:09:13.160
Okay, good, good. Trace the
origin with this code; 0010010.

01:09:13.162 --> 01:09:15.529
I know what's at stake
and we're working on it.

01:09:15.531 --> 01:09:17.965
I'm going to have
to get back to you.

01:09:17.966 --> 01:09:20.901
Well, come... guy! Guy!

01:09:28.209 --> 01:09:30.169
<i>Reporter we've just learned
that all us banks...</i>

01:09:30.193 --> 01:09:32.145
<i>Have been ordered closed
until further notice.</i>

01:09:32.147 --> 01:09:34.113
This is bullshit. I can't
even get on the website.

01:09:34.116 --> 01:09:35.381
They can do anything,
like most politicians.

01:09:35.384 --> 01:09:37.117
They believe they can
just order it...

01:09:37.118 --> 01:09:38.618
I watched the bank teller
lock the front doors.

01:09:38.621 --> 01:09:40.501
It was locked. The bank
doesn't close 'til 5:00.

01:09:40.502 --> 01:09:42.103
You're not letting us
close our accounts?

01:09:42.127 --> 01:09:43.323
They kicked us all out.

01:09:43.325 --> 01:09:45.685
Why won't they let us close our
own account? Is there a law?

01:09:45.709 --> 01:09:47.261
Can you show me the law?

01:09:47.263 --> 01:09:49.196
I'm going to need this room.

01:09:49.198 --> 01:09:50.596
Thank you.

01:09:50.599 --> 01:09:52.666
I'll be right outside,
madame president.

01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:01.942
Madame president.

01:10:01.944 --> 01:10:03.644
I'm a customer. I'm a customer.
You're outside with everybody...

01:10:03.646 --> 01:10:05.679
She's... whoa! What
are you doing?!

01:10:05.681 --> 01:10:10.017
What are you doing?! Oh, my god!

01:10:10.019 --> 01:10:14.588
No one really saw this coming.

01:10:14.590 --> 01:10:17.291
Wait a second. I'm tracking
this crash just fine.

01:10:17.293 --> 01:10:20.193
Leading the people into panic.

01:10:20.195 --> 01:10:22.515
What I'm not tracking, in order
to get these short sales...

01:10:22.539 --> 01:10:25.165
To work, we've got to get the
market back up and functioning.

01:10:25.167 --> 01:10:28.035
Right. We pull them
back up online.

01:10:28.037 --> 01:10:30.370
How do you get the
markets back up online?

01:10:30.372 --> 01:10:34.975
Oh, I don't... guy Clifton does.

01:10:40.982 --> 01:10:44.184
I just... I need to know
if it's possible for us...

01:10:44.186 --> 01:10:46.620
To override this thing and bring
the markets back on-line.

01:10:46.622 --> 01:10:48.455
We slow it all down.

01:10:48.457 --> 01:10:52.392
Yeah, it's possible...
But what next?

01:10:52.394 --> 01:10:55.262
That's the million
dollar question.

01:10:55.264 --> 01:10:56.824
<i>Sinclair I don't know
why they'd warn...</i>

01:10:56.848 --> 01:10:58.098
<i>The rich stock brokers...</i>

01:10:58.100 --> 01:10:59.900
<i>But they said that they've
already hacked...</i>

01:10:59.902 --> 01:11:01.602
<i>The New York stock
exchange backup.</i>

01:11:01.604 --> 01:11:04.204
The government will
call guy Clifton.

01:11:04.206 --> 01:11:08.008
And the only reason they know
about guy Clifton's skill set...

01:11:08.010 --> 01:11:13.313
Is because... I conveniently
recommended his indictment.

01:11:16.417 --> 01:11:19.319
I want you to get me a list
of all our positions...

01:11:19.321 --> 01:11:22.322
Long and short, everything
in the portfolio.

01:11:22.324 --> 01:11:25.625
He'll play the markets
just like us.

01:11:25.627 --> 01:11:27.694
Come on, help me fix this.

01:11:27.696 --> 01:11:29.396
What's in it for me?

01:11:29.398 --> 01:11:32.466
But he's also facing jail
time, thanks to yours truly.

01:11:32.468 --> 01:11:33.734
I'm gonna need immunity.

01:11:33.736 --> 01:11:35.469
So they'll offer him immunity...

01:11:35.471 --> 01:11:38.205
To stop an inevitable
terror attack.

01:11:38.207 --> 01:11:41.174
It's risky... but they
won't have any choice.

01:11:41.176 --> 01:11:43.010
We'll make sure of that.

01:11:43.012 --> 01:11:45.612
These cyber threats have
no lasting implications...

01:11:45.614 --> 01:11:48.048
On any market ever.

01:11:48.050 --> 01:11:49.549
Ben, do the right thing.

01:11:49.551 --> 01:11:55.155
The virus I give Ben
isn't unbreakable.

01:11:55.157 --> 01:11:57.157
It'll take some hours,
but they'll crack it.

01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:00.394
No matter what happens...

01:12:00.396 --> 01:12:03.096
Even if Clifton figures
the whole thing out...

01:12:03.098 --> 01:12:05.766
He'll still pull the
markets back up online...

01:12:05.768 --> 01:12:08.502
Because if he doesn't...

01:12:08.504 --> 01:12:12.773
He'll lose all his
money, just like us.

01:12:12.775 --> 01:12:16.410
So you're betting our
banks on one man's greed?

01:12:16.412 --> 01:12:19.112
Absolutely.

01:12:19.114 --> 01:12:21.081
<i>Man the cabinet and the
federal reserve...</i>

01:12:21.083 --> 01:12:23.216
<i>Are meeting behind closed
doors at the moment...</i>

01:12:23.218 --> 01:12:25.719
<i>Discussing next steps
while they desperately...</i>

01:12:25.721 --> 01:12:28.088
<i>Try to keep the economy alive.</i>

01:12:28.090 --> 01:12:30.090
<i>They know how much
money they need...</i>

01:12:30.092 --> 01:12:33.060
<i>But they don't know how
they're going to get it.</i>

01:12:33.062 --> 01:12:36.496
Crazy virus del banco gave you.

01:12:36.498 --> 01:12:39.800
I didn't know I was
planting a virus.

01:12:39.802 --> 01:12:42.169
This isn't your fault, son.

01:12:45.273 --> 01:12:47.340
You were trying to
do the right thing.

01:12:50.645 --> 01:12:53.346
I didn't let you trust
me enough, Ben.

01:12:57.718 --> 01:13:00.554
I hear you broke
up with creason.

01:13:00.556 --> 01:13:04.458
I was under the impression
you were trying to hijack...

01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:08.662
Do you have any idea what
that does to a girl like her?

01:13:10.765 --> 01:13:13.100
She doesn't give a shit
about any of this, Ben.

01:13:13.102 --> 01:13:14.801
You know that.

01:13:14.803 --> 01:13:18.171
Any way to make this right?

01:13:19.807 --> 01:13:23.610
This was gonna happen sooner
or later, not this soon.

01:13:23.612 --> 01:13:25.779
Not this soon.

01:13:25.781 --> 01:13:28.148
I didn't want creason to
have to choose sides...

01:13:28.150 --> 01:13:30.884
After all this went down.

01:13:30.886 --> 01:13:33.520
You'll always be her father.

01:13:44.232 --> 01:13:45.799
Backend server code confirmed.

01:13:45.801 --> 01:13:48.869
<i>We have a double-enter
enable key on my mark.</i>

01:13:48.871 --> 01:13:55.509
<i>3... 2, 1.</i>

01:14:17.732 --> 01:14:20.600
I need your word, interest
rates must remain low...

01:14:20.602 --> 01:14:23.737
Loans approved, money flowing...

01:14:23.739 --> 01:14:28.375
Because we are doing this for
the good of the people...

01:14:28.377 --> 01:14:30.710
Because it's the
right thing to do.

01:14:34.449 --> 01:14:36.183
Hello?

01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:44.691
<i>Schwab guy.</i>

01:14:52.333 --> 01:14:53.973
Hey! Free money! Get
the fuck out of here!

01:14:53.997 --> 01:14:55.763
<i>Schwab hello?</i>

01:15:07.882 --> 01:15:09.816
<i>Hello? You know, schwab...</i>

01:15:09.818 --> 01:15:11.518
You're not gonna convince me...

01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:13.753
That the system's just
gonna fix itself again.

01:15:13.755 --> 01:15:17.524
<i>Guy the banks and the fed...</i>

01:15:17.526 --> 01:15:19.926
<i>Where did that money
come from, schwab?</i>

01:15:19.928 --> 01:15:22.963
<i>Hm? Whose money is that?</i>

01:15:22.965 --> 01:15:25.865
<i>We the people shouldn't be
made up of you or me...</i>

01:15:25.867 --> 01:15:27.634
<i>Or the bankers that
fucking control us!</i>

01:15:27.636 --> 01:15:29.436
<i>And don't tell me
that I'm wrong.</i>

01:15:29.438 --> 01:15:32.339
<i>Because up until today, I
was one of those guys.</i>

01:15:32.341 --> 01:15:35.742
<i>Taking people's money and
manipulating the system.</i>

01:15:35.744 --> 01:15:36.910
<i>I've owned that.</i>

01:15:39.914 --> 01:15:41.748
I've owned it.

01:15:44.585 --> 01:15:48.788
The system... does not work.

01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:51.524
<i>Your money is not
safe in the banks.</i>

01:15:51.526 --> 01:15:53.927
<i>Don't keep more
than what you need.</i>

01:15:53.929 --> 01:15:56.169
<i>If the banks get in trouble,
they will take your money.</i>

01:15:56.193 --> 01:15:57.864
<i>The government will
take your money.</i>

01:15:57.866 --> 01:16:00.900
<i>We made realistic rules so that
it could never happen again.</i>

01:16:00.902 --> 01:16:03.837
<i>We do not have jurisdiction
to directly go out...</i>

01:16:03.839 --> 01:16:07.307
<i>And audit reserve
bank activities.</i>

01:16:07.309 --> 01:16:09.376
Mr. del banco. Yeah.

01:16:09.378 --> 01:16:11.411
Can I ask you a question?

01:16:11.413 --> 01:16:14.514
Why do you meet here?

01:16:14.516 --> 01:16:18.051
Why are we at the circus?

01:16:19.987 --> 01:16:22.689
This is where the stock
market was created.

01:16:24.625 --> 01:16:25.925
Come here.

01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:30.964
Now there are several
theories, of course...

01:16:30.966 --> 01:16:33.600
But this is the one
i subscribe to.

01:16:33.602 --> 01:16:37.437
It was a hot summer
day in 1792...

01:16:37.439 --> 01:16:42.976
And four men sitting right
over there, created...

01:16:42.978 --> 01:16:45.612
They created a market place...

01:16:45.614 --> 01:16:47.947
Whereby people like you and I...

01:16:47.949 --> 01:16:51.351
Could bet on a
working-class America...

01:16:51.353 --> 01:16:54.754
Through stocks and bonds.

01:16:54.756 --> 01:16:57.724
It was the greatest
game ever invented.

01:16:57.726 --> 01:16:59.492
That's what they called it.

01:16:59.494 --> 01:17:02.962
And there were two clowns,
performing an operatic...

01:17:02.964 --> 01:17:06.032
While they were being
chased by a bear.

01:17:06.034 --> 01:17:08.468
Right there.

01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:12.005
And it was the clowns
that gave them the idea.

01:17:12.007 --> 01:17:14.974
But the clowns had
to outrun the bear.

01:17:14.976 --> 01:17:18.812
Well, he didn't have
to outrun the bear...

01:17:18.814 --> 01:17:21.081
He just had to outrun
the other guy.

01:17:23.884 --> 01:17:26.953
Cheers to the American dream.

01:17:31.425 --> 01:17:34.928
<i>Guy you have got to tell the
people the truth, schwab.</i>

01:17:37.765 --> 01:17:40.133
<i>You got to tell the truth.</i>

01:17:42.870 --> 01:17:45.605
<i>You got to do the right thing.</i>

01:17:45.607 --> 01:17:47.841
<i>Letting the banks get
away with this...</i>

01:17:47.843 --> 01:17:51.544
<i>It's just not the right thing.</i>

01:17:51.546 --> 01:17:53.713
<i>You know why?</i>

01:17:53.715 --> 01:17:57.117
<i>Because our kids still need
