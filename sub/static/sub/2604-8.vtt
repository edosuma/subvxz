Original Air Date on August 9, 2012

00:10.879 --> 00:11.912
You're late.

00:11.914 --> 00:13.047
Nope.
30 seconds early.

00:13.049 --> 00:14.849
Good.
Learning to tell time.

00:14.851 --> 00:15.950
Ha ha ha.

00:15.952 --> 00:17.384
I won't be in today.

00:17.386 --> 00:19.153
What?
Does Jessica know?

00:19.155 --> 00:20.588
I don't tell Jessica
everything.

00:20.590 --> 00:22.456
Oh, it's like a "Harvey
Specter's day off"

00:22.458 --> 00:23.858
kind of a thing?
Should I call Ed Rooney,

00:23.860 --> 00:25.226
see if we can
get Sloane out of school?

00:25.228 --> 00:26.560
Not in the mood today.

00:26.562 --> 00:27.895
Life moves pretty fast
if you don't

00:27.897 --> 00:29.396
stop and look around
once in a while.

00:29.398 --> 00:30.464
What do you think about
Hardman running for

00:30.466 --> 00:31.565
managing partner?

00:31.567 --> 00:33.033
- Think he's going to win.
- Why?

00:33.035 --> 00:34.802
Because you don't
call for a vote

00:34.804 --> 00:35.970
unless you have the votes.

00:35.972 --> 00:37.171
Good.

00:37.173 --> 00:39.206
We need to tip the scales
in her favor.

00:39.208 --> 00:40.241
Okay. What do you
need me to do?

00:40.243 --> 00:41.242
I need you to step up.

00:41.244 --> 00:42.843
You're not going to
like it.

00:42.845 --> 00:44.879
And Jessica can't know
it came from me.

00:44.881 --> 00:46.981
I gave Hardman the road map
to settling with Tanner.

00:46.983 --> 00:48.082
You voted for it.

00:48.084 --> 00:49.216
Haven't we done enough
to Jessica?

00:49.218 --> 00:51.085
We're not doing this
to Jessica,

00:51.087 --> 00:54.021
we're doing this
<i>for</i> Jessica.

00:54.023 --> 00:56.056
We gonna cross the line
with this?

00:56.058 --> 00:57.291
We've been crossing lines

00:57.293 --> 00:59.059
long before we even
ever met.

01:23.385 --> 01:25.753
How do I know the Patriots
aren't going 19-0?

01:25.755 --> 01:28.522
Because no team from Boston
is going undefeated

01:28.524 --> 01:30.491
when the road
goes through New York.

01:30.493 --> 01:31.659
You got that right.

01:31.661 --> 01:33.294
Goddamn Patriots.

01:33.296 --> 01:35.529
- Your dad called.
- I'll call him later.

01:35.531 --> 01:36.931
He always asks why
the idiots in charge

01:36.933 --> 01:38.465
haven't made you
partner yet.

01:38.467 --> 01:40.367
He's so proud.
It's sweet.

01:40.369 --> 01:43.604
He's right.

01:43.606 --> 01:45.606
You have that look
on your face.

01:47.809 --> 01:49.610
Louis is getting
a secretary.

01:49.612 --> 01:50.911
Her name...

01:50.913 --> 01:52.146
is Norma.

01:52.148 --> 01:53.180
What is she,
100 years old?

01:53.182 --> 01:54.181
She won't last a week.

01:54.183 --> 01:56.383
You heard it here first.

01:56.385 --> 02:00.321
Oh, and Jessica's
on her way down.

02:00.323 --> 02:03.324
So, you buried
the Jessica news

02:03.326 --> 02:04.792
to lead with
the Louis news.

02:04.794 --> 02:07.528
I'm not apologizing
for who I am.

02:09.264 --> 02:11.665
Hi, is this the location of
the douchebag convention?

02:11.667 --> 02:14.234
It is now.

02:14.236 --> 02:15.569
I thought you
went to work.

02:15.571 --> 02:17.805
- I had to get this.
- Whoa.

02:17.807 --> 02:20.140
Look at that.
The world's smallest burrito.

02:20.142 --> 02:22.276
Which is why I got more.

02:22.278 --> 02:25.479
Whoa.
Breakfast of champions.

02:25.481 --> 02:26.513
Trevor, I can't.

02:26.515 --> 02:27.615
I'm a bike messenger.

02:27.617 --> 02:31.085
I deliver packages,
or people die.

02:31.087 --> 02:32.653
Am I gonna have to give you
a code red?

02:32.655 --> 02:34.355
Mm...

02:34.357 --> 02:35.623
- Okay.
- Ohh.

02:35.625 --> 02:37.625
All you did was weaken
a country today, Kaffee.

02:37.627 --> 02:41.161
Well, what can I say?

02:41.163 --> 02:44.765
Really? Okay.

02:44.767 --> 02:46.567
- I gotta go to work.
- Thank you.

02:46.569 --> 02:48.469
Remember, we're going out
tonight, so...

02:48.471 --> 02:50.170
you know, don't be you.

02:50.172 --> 02:52.306
Oh, wait a minute. I still
owe you from last week.

02:52.308 --> 02:53.707
No, no, no, you get
the dickhead discount.

02:53.709 --> 02:55.776
Oh, is that 30%? Or is that
the shitface coupon?

02:55.778 --> 02:57.444
Same thing, because you're
a shitface and a dickhead.

02:57.446 --> 02:58.779
Right, got it.
Have a great day!

02:58.781 --> 02:59.880
Later, asshole.

02:59.882 --> 03:01.882
Later.

03:04.019 --> 03:04.985
Shit.

03:11.826 --> 03:13.127
I need your help
on something.

03:13.129 --> 03:14.762
Show me the skulls,
I'll crack 'em.

03:14.764 --> 03:17.398
Not for this. For this,
I need your discretion.

03:17.400 --> 03:19.366
I also need to know
you'll take it seriously.

03:19.368 --> 03:20.768
I haven't worked in
the mail room

03:20.770 --> 03:23.237
in a long time,
Jessica.

03:23.239 --> 03:26.040
Someone's stealing from our
clients' escrow accounts.

03:26.042 --> 03:27.207
Why isn't Daniel here?

03:27.209 --> 03:29.076
Daniel's managing partner.

03:29.078 --> 03:30.477
Isn't that why Daniel
should be here?

03:30.479 --> 03:32.312
And I'm in charge
of the money.

03:32.314 --> 03:35.015
Oh, you want to go to him with
a solution, not a problem.

03:35.017 --> 03:36.417
You don't always have to
let your superiors know

03:36.419 --> 03:38.419
what you're up to.
I'll try to remember that.

03:38.421 --> 03:39.520
Really? I thought you were
under the impression

03:39.522 --> 03:41.221
you had invented it.

03:41.223 --> 03:42.256
What do you
need me to do?

03:42.258 --> 03:43.557
I need you to step up.

03:43.559 --> 03:45.559
Do whatever you have to do
to find out who did it,

03:45.561 --> 03:47.661
and do it quietly.
I will.

03:47.663 --> 03:48.829
And when I do,

03:48.831 --> 03:52.032
I want you to step up
for me.

03:52.034 --> 03:54.234
What do you want,
Harvey?

03:54.236 --> 03:56.370
I'm an associate
who kicks more ass

03:56.372 --> 03:59.506
than any partner
in this goddamn firm.

03:59.508 --> 04:01.608
I want a seat
at the table.

04:34.817 --> 04:36.822
There's so many partners,
it could be anyone of them.

04:37.304 --> 04:38.470
Watson scares the kids,

04:38.472 --> 04:39.905
but I don't make him
for the embezzler.

04:39.907 --> 04:42.441
The embezzler?
He's not a Batman villain.

04:42.443 --> 04:44.042
And it's just that kind of
thinking that has led you

04:44.044 --> 04:45.243
to not catching him.

04:45.245 --> 04:47.546
I was just assigned this
15 minutes ago.

04:47.548 --> 04:49.114
Have you ever looked into
Dortch's eyes?

04:49.116 --> 04:51.216
- Yeah, he's cross-eyed.
- Or is he?

04:51.218 --> 04:52.617
What does that even mean?

04:52.619 --> 04:54.019
Is there a reward
for this?

04:54.021 --> 04:56.688
Yes. I make Jessica happy,
I make partner.

04:56.690 --> 04:57.889
Ooh, then we get
a bigger office.

04:57.891 --> 04:58.990
Then I get
a bigger office.

04:58.992 --> 05:00.158
Hey, I'm
helping you out here.

05:00.160 --> 05:01.226
Are you?

05:01.228 --> 05:02.627
What do you think
about Ginsberg?

05:02.629 --> 05:03.829
We need to
follow the money.

05:03.831 --> 05:05.931
Which will lead
straight to Rutherford.

05:05.933 --> 05:07.866
This would be so much more fun
with margaritas.

05:07.868 --> 05:09.368
Okay, that's it.
I need facts,

05:09.370 --> 05:10.569
and I need them right now.
Well then,

05:10.571 --> 05:11.837
why did you ask me to
guess who did it?

05:11.839 --> 05:13.071
I didn't.

05:13.073 --> 05:14.639
- Then why am I here?
- I need you to tell me

05:14.641 --> 05:16.808
who handles these five
escrow accounts.

05:16.810 --> 05:18.777
Oh. Well,
that's easy.

05:18.779 --> 05:20.379
Zoe.

05:20.381 --> 05:23.115
God, why didn't you just say so
in the first place?

05:23.117 --> 05:26.718
Get out.

05:26.720 --> 05:27.919
If you want to talk to
Monica Eton,

05:27.921 --> 05:29.087
call her yourself.

05:29.089 --> 05:30.655
I called her,
but she hung up

05:30.657 --> 05:31.990
the minute I said
Pearson Hardman.

05:31.992 --> 05:33.925
Of course she did.
She hates everybody here.

05:33.927 --> 05:35.394
- She doesn't hate you.
- Well, no,

05:35.396 --> 05:36.561
but that's because
I'm adorable.

05:36.563 --> 05:38.029
See, I can't help you
with that.

05:38.031 --> 05:39.798
So why don't you try using
your powers of adorability

05:39.800 --> 05:41.166
for good?
Not a word.

05:41.168 --> 05:43.702
And that is not
being adorable.

05:43.704 --> 05:45.837
Mike, seriously, this is

05:45.839 --> 05:47.038
not a small thing.

05:47.040 --> 05:48.473
Look, the last time you
asked me to help you

05:48.475 --> 05:50.409
it was about Donna, and look at
how that turned out.

05:50.411 --> 05:53.044
Okay, that wasn't me,
and this isn't that--

05:53.046 --> 05:54.813
Monica Eton is not Donna.

05:54.815 --> 05:57.182
Maybe not, but she still
means something to me.

05:57.184 --> 05:59.684
So tell me why I should
convince her to talk to someone

05:59.686 --> 06:01.553
who works at a firm
that she hates.

06:01.555 --> 06:03.288
Because...

06:03.290 --> 06:04.322
You don't know

06:04.324 --> 06:07.092
the real reason
why she left.

06:12.799 --> 06:13.932
Monica.

06:13.934 --> 06:15.700
Hey, it's so funny
running into you.

06:15.702 --> 06:17.436
Louis, we both
work here.

06:17.438 --> 06:18.737
Yeah. Listen, I just wanted
to tell you that

06:18.739 --> 06:19.971
I joined
the Hudson Racquet Club.

06:19.973 --> 06:21.106
You know, I just figured
I'd treat myself

06:21.108 --> 06:22.274
for making junior partner.

06:22.276 --> 06:23.809
Good for you.

06:23.811 --> 06:25.076
Yeah, I'd love to get you
out on the court.

06:25.078 --> 06:26.411
Maybe like, if you're
available Saturday?

06:26.413 --> 06:27.813
- I can't.
- I can't Saturday, but--

06:27.815 --> 06:29.047
- Monica, Louis.

06:29.049 --> 06:30.449
- Harvey.
- H-dog.

06:30.451 --> 06:31.650
- No.
- What?

06:31.652 --> 06:33.251
No, listen. I wanted to
talk to you about--

06:33.253 --> 06:34.753
Cashing and burning
with Monica?

06:34.755 --> 06:36.354
I didn't crash and burn
with her.

06:36.356 --> 06:38.223
So why don't you stop quoting
whatever "B" movie

06:38.225 --> 06:40.192
that came from, and call me
when you finally see <i>Amadeus.</i>

06:40.194 --> 06:42.160
Salieri, Mozart.

06:42.162 --> 06:43.829
Are you wearing braces?

06:43.831 --> 06:45.297
- Proudly.
- Walk me through that.

06:45.299 --> 06:46.431
I will walk you
through it.

06:46.433 --> 06:49.000
Uh, for starters,
it costs $15,000--

06:49.002 --> 06:50.702
Okay, I don't have time
for this.

06:50.704 --> 06:52.204
I heard you had a closed-door
meeting with Jessica.

06:52.206 --> 06:54.606
I did.
Or I didn't.

06:54.608 --> 06:55.941
Either way, it's
none of your business.

06:55.943 --> 06:57.309
I just think it's weird
when, you know,

06:57.311 --> 06:58.710
you have a one-on-one
with her,

06:58.712 --> 07:00.078
when you're an associate
and I'm a junior partner.

07:00.080 --> 07:01.413
Proudly wearing braces.

07:01.415 --> 07:03.949
You mi--for your information,
it is a very small step

07:03.951 --> 07:05.951
from junior to senior partner
when you have straight teeth.

07:05.953 --> 07:07.352
Just know that people take you
very seriously.

07:07.354 --> 07:09.588
That tie. I have the same one.

07:09.590 --> 07:10.922
I don't want to
see it again.

07:10.924 --> 07:13.592
What would he have said if you
weren't wearing braces?

07:13.594 --> 07:14.993
What a dick.

07:14.995 --> 07:17.696
Mark my words, if I am ever
in charge of anyone,

07:17.698 --> 07:18.897
I am going to be the most
beloved leader

07:18.899 --> 07:20.866
that those lucky bastards
have ever seen.

07:20.868 --> 07:22.968
You know what I'd do,
I'd be--

07:22.970 --> 07:25.937
H-dog? H-dog?

07:25.939 --> 07:27.739
Zoe Lawford.

07:27.741 --> 07:29.074
I'm sorry, you are?

07:29.076 --> 07:30.876
The only man here who could
beat you at pool.

07:30.878 --> 07:32.277
Uh, head-to-head
is even.

07:32.279 --> 07:33.478
I'm up by one.

07:33.480 --> 07:34.946
Well, I thought you'd
given up altogether.

07:34.948 --> 07:36.214
You don't call,
you don't write.

07:36.216 --> 07:37.983
I was just trying to give it
a little time.

07:37.985 --> 07:40.485
You know, letting mystery
build back up.

07:40.487 --> 07:42.220
You mean you didn't know
I transferred

07:42.222 --> 07:43.688
to beautiful escrow.

07:43.690 --> 07:45.123
Hey, I have my finger
on the pulse.

07:45.125 --> 07:47.259
Really?

07:47.261 --> 07:48.960
Name three associates
in tax law.

07:48.962 --> 07:50.929
Boring, more boring,

07:50.931 --> 07:52.163
and boring in a skirt.

07:52.165 --> 07:54.966
Oh! August 3rd.

07:54.968 --> 07:56.234
Date of my transfer.

07:56.236 --> 07:57.569
I did know.

07:57.571 --> 08:00.071
We miss you up there.

08:00.073 --> 08:01.439
We miss me,
or you miss me?

08:01.441 --> 08:02.908
We miss you.

08:02.910 --> 08:06.411
I need you.

08:06.413 --> 08:08.313
You're here to look at my
files, aren't you?

08:08.315 --> 08:09.614
I need you to type in
your password

08:09.616 --> 08:11.550
and leave for five minutes.

08:11.552 --> 08:12.717
You're doing
something wrong.

08:12.719 --> 08:13.919
No, I'm fixing
something wrong.

08:13.921 --> 08:15.353
- Fixing what?
- That, I can't tell you.

08:15.355 --> 08:16.521
Why? Don't trust me?

08:16.523 --> 08:17.889
I do.
But if I tell you,

08:17.891 --> 08:20.158
then I'm breaking
someone's trust in me.

08:20.160 --> 08:22.327
Okay, let me just
get this straight.

08:22.329 --> 08:24.229
You're asking me
to risk my job to help you

08:24.231 --> 08:26.731
solve a mysterious problem
for an unknown person,

08:26.733 --> 08:29.701
based on nothing
but your word?

08:29.703 --> 08:31.903
That's exactly
what I'm asking.

08:31.905 --> 08:34.739
Ahh.

08:36.710 --> 08:39.311
Oh my God, there's an emergency
in wills and trusts.

08:46.586 --> 08:49.321
Thank you. Cheers.

08:49.323 --> 08:51.523
You ready?
I am. Hit me, hit me.

08:51.525 --> 08:53.158
All right, um...
All right.

08:53.160 --> 08:54.459
This guy.
Favorite movie.

08:54.461 --> 08:55.994
<i>Grease.</i>

08:55.996 --> 08:57.696
<i>2.</i>
<i>- Yes, I agree with you.</i>

08:57.698 --> 08:58.964
Oh. What about this,

08:58.966 --> 09:01.099
Rico Suave over here,
what are you thinking?

09:01.101 --> 09:02.200
Shaves his chest.

09:02.202 --> 09:03.602
No.
No, no, man,

09:03.604 --> 09:05.370
that's a thing that like,
real men do now.

09:05.372 --> 09:06.671
Oh, I don't think so.

09:06.673 --> 09:07.973
- Yeah--
- I'm sorry,

09:07.975 --> 09:10.108
did you just say real men
shave their chests?

09:10.110 --> 09:12.010
Oh, um, not--
not real men.

09:12.012 --> 09:15.113
Just me.
That's all.

09:15.115 --> 09:16.448
I like him.
He's funny.

09:16.450 --> 09:17.515
- And hairless.
- Oh, I'm Jenny.

09:17.517 --> 09:20.418
Mike.

09:20.420 --> 09:23.121
And just so you guys know, uh,
he shaves his chest

09:23.123 --> 09:25.724
because he is, I'm very proud
of him, an Olympic swimmer.

09:25.726 --> 09:27.092
- I am.
- Is that right?

09:27.094 --> 09:29.494
So that's what you do when you
meet girls, you lie?

09:29.496 --> 09:31.696
- Totally.
- If they're hot.

09:31.698 --> 09:35.000
We also buy them drinks,
I'm not sure if--

09:35.002 --> 09:36.101
- Oh, we drink.
- Uh, yeah.

09:36.103 --> 09:40.038
- Bartender?
- Yeah? No, go for it.

09:40.040 --> 09:41.606
Wait, no way a girl
thought you were

09:41.608 --> 09:42.807
a point guard
for the Knicks.

09:42.809 --> 09:44.242
Well, you've never
seen me dribble.

09:44.244 --> 09:45.744
Uh, I would like to know
something about you

09:45.746 --> 09:47.145
that's not a lie.

09:47.147 --> 09:48.680
Ooh.

09:48.682 --> 09:50.982
Um...

09:50.984 --> 09:52.183
I love my grandmother.

09:52.185 --> 09:54.352
Well, now we know why
he's single.

09:54.354 --> 09:56.021
Come on,
it's kind of sweet.

09:56.023 --> 09:58.123
Look, I--
I'm not usually in it for him,

09:58.125 --> 09:59.624
but I really gotta
step in here.

09:59.626 --> 10:01.026
Um...

10:01.028 --> 10:02.694
Dude's a genius.
Trevor, stop.

10:02.696 --> 10:04.295
- No, no, no--
- What do you mean, genius?

10:04.297 --> 10:06.197
- All right.
- It's not a thing, it's just--

10:06.199 --> 10:07.365
No, no, no,
here we go.

10:07.367 --> 10:10.335
Ask him a math question.
Hard as you want.

10:10.337 --> 10:11.736
- Trevor.
- Hard as you want!

10:11.738 --> 10:12.837
Anything.

10:12.839 --> 10:15.974
What's 75 times 863,

10:15.976 --> 10:20.078
minus 10?

10:20.080 --> 10:22.213
64,715.

10:22.215 --> 10:23.982
- Bang.
- How do we know that's right?

10:23.984 --> 10:27.686
Uh, it's right.
It's right.

10:27.688 --> 10:29.621
All right, think of a book
you read in high school,

10:29.623 --> 10:31.656
he will recite the first page...
I don't want to do this,

10:31.658 --> 10:33.091
- Verbatim.
- I don't want to do it.

10:33.093 --> 10:36.161
Come on, come on, come on,
just do it--do it for me.

10:36.163 --> 10:40.065
<i>Moby Dick.</i>

10:40.067 --> 10:41.499
"Call me Ishmael.
Some years ago,

10:41.501 --> 10:44.436
"never mind how long ago
precisely,

10:44.438 --> 10:45.637
"having little or no money--"

10:45.639 --> 10:48.039
<i>Old Man and the Sea.</i>

10:48.041 --> 10:51.509
"The box with the baits was
under the stern of the skiff

10:51.511 --> 10:54.646
"along with the club that was
used to subdue the big fish--"

10:54.648 --> 10:56.748
I know that one,
that's not right.

10:56.750 --> 10:59.684
Oh, no, no, no.
I got bored, I did page seven.

10:59.686 --> 11:03.321
<i>Curious George.</i>

11:03.323 --> 11:04.689
I can't.

11:04.691 --> 11:06.825
I can't do that.
What? Come on, you can do

11:06.827 --> 11:08.326
the other ones, you don't know
<i>Curious George?</i>

11:08.328 --> 11:09.661
I never read
<i>Curious George.</i>

11:09.663 --> 11:11.329
You never read
<i>Curious George?</i>

11:11.331 --> 11:12.697
Monkeys freak me out.

11:12.699 --> 11:14.232
My girlfriend and I
have to go to the bathroom.

11:14.234 --> 11:16.201
Mmhmm.

11:16.203 --> 11:18.336
I have to go to
the bathroom.

11:18.338 --> 11:20.171
And when we come back,
these drinkies--

11:20.173 --> 11:23.374
Will be filled.
Absolutely, 100%.

11:24.878 --> 11:26.978
Dude, what are you doing?

11:26.980 --> 11:28.313
Are you trying to
blow this?

11:28.315 --> 11:29.814
What are you
talking about?

11:29.816 --> 11:30.982
I know that you have
<i>Curious George,</i>

11:30.984 --> 11:32.083
I've seen it on
your bookshelf.

11:32.085 --> 11:33.718
For once, we don't
have to lie.

11:33.720 --> 11:36.054
My mom gave me that book.
She read it to me every night.

11:36.056 --> 11:37.789
I'm not going to use it
to just pick up some girl.

11:37.791 --> 11:39.390
You don't have to do
anything.

11:39.392 --> 11:41.726
Let me tell them.
Okay?

11:41.728 --> 11:43.061
You'll probably go home
with both of them.

11:43.063 --> 11:45.730
Trevor.
Stop.

11:49.468 --> 11:51.136
Fine.

11:51.138 --> 11:52.437
I hate your guts.

12:03.015 --> 12:04.916
I followed the money.

12:04.918 --> 12:06.217
Let's hear it.

12:06.219 --> 12:08.686
Louis Litt is the man
we're looking for.

12:08.688 --> 12:10.421
Are you sure?

12:10.423 --> 12:11.790
I told you
I followed the money.

12:11.792 --> 12:13.892
Which, by the way, he's been
spending left and right.

12:13.894 --> 12:15.326
You're talking about
the braces.

12:15.328 --> 12:16.728
$15,000.

12:16.730 --> 12:18.863
Not to mention
the Hudson Racquet Club.

12:18.865 --> 12:20.231
Who knows what else?

12:20.233 --> 12:23.301
That club costs
$60,000 a year.

12:23.303 --> 12:26.137
What are you
going to do?

12:26.139 --> 12:27.639
I'm gonna
break him down,

12:27.641 --> 12:30.575
and I'm gonna
crack him open.

12:52.470 --> 12:53.603
You wanted to see me?

12:53.605 --> 12:55.539
I did.

12:55.541 --> 12:57.340
Well, if this is
about Norma?

12:57.342 --> 12:59.276
Truth be told, we can
do a lot better.

12:59.278 --> 13:03.046
This isn't about Norma.

13:03.048 --> 13:04.514
Pray tell.

13:04.516 --> 13:05.715
How can your your newest
junior partner

13:05.717 --> 13:07.150
be of service to thee?

13:07.152 --> 13:09.052
Pray tell?

13:09.054 --> 13:11.688
You can pray tell me

13:11.690 --> 13:13.056
how the hell you got
the nerve

13:13.058 --> 13:15.392
to stand in front of
my face

13:15.394 --> 13:18.395
after what you did.

13:22.200 --> 13:24.401
I couldn't help it.

13:24.403 --> 13:25.635
All those late nights.

13:25.637 --> 13:28.705
Your fibers are
so tantalizing.

13:28.707 --> 13:30.674
What?

13:30.676 --> 13:32.542
I fell asleep
on your couch,

13:32.544 --> 13:34.945
just once, because it's
so damn soft.

13:34.947 --> 13:38.548
Not the topic of
this conversation.

13:38.550 --> 13:39.783
Is this about
the MySpace profile?

13:39.785 --> 13:44.387
Because I can
take that down.

13:44.389 --> 13:46.123
Okay, fine.

13:46.125 --> 13:47.324
You got me.

13:47.326 --> 13:48.758
I've copied the complete
works of Shakespeare

13:48.760 --> 13:50.494
and I've charged it to
those bastards at C.M.,

13:50.496 --> 13:51.895
I regularly raid Harvey's
liquor, and I've

13:51.897 --> 13:53.430
taken every raspberry-bran bar
from the kitchen

13:53.432 --> 13:54.764
that we've ever bought--
Louis-

13:54.766 --> 13:55.765
I need to know where
Stanley gets them, do you?

13:55.767 --> 13:59.069
Enough!

13:59.071 --> 14:00.704
Well, should I just--

14:00.706 --> 14:02.973
what, pack my things?

14:02.975 --> 14:04.708
Not necessary.

14:04.710 --> 14:05.842
Thank you, Jessica.

14:05.844 --> 14:09.412
Thank you for your mercy.

14:09.414 --> 14:10.981
Louis.

14:10.983 --> 14:12.315
Yeah.

14:12.317 --> 14:14.584
You will replace every one of
those goddamn bran bars.

14:14.586 --> 14:16.286
Yes.

14:16.288 --> 14:18.355
And, I promise not to walk
barefoot in the library

14:18.357 --> 14:19.389
ever again.
Out.

14:19.391 --> 14:20.857
Okay.

14:27.198 --> 14:28.365
Next time you
bring me a name,

14:28.367 --> 14:29.900
make goddamn sure
it's the right one.

14:29.902 --> 14:31.234
I followed the money.

14:31.236 --> 14:32.435
You got lost on the way.

14:32.437 --> 14:34.504
You saying Louis
was framed?

14:34.506 --> 14:36.673
I'm saying you
shit the bed.

14:36.675 --> 14:38.575
I gave you a job to do,
and you promptly

14:38.577 --> 14:40.177
asked for a seat
at the table.

14:40.179 --> 14:41.511
You want to sit
with the grown-ups?

14:41.513 --> 14:43.513
Do your job like a man.

14:48.452 --> 14:49.786
Ouch.

14:49.788 --> 14:51.188
What?

14:51.190 --> 14:52.722
You need me to remove
Jessica's foot from your ass?

14:52.724 --> 14:53.990
You heard all that?

14:53.992 --> 14:55.125
Intercom was on.

14:55.127 --> 14:56.893
Couldn't help myself.

14:56.895 --> 14:58.195
Has it ever
been on before?

14:58.197 --> 14:59.362
Has it ever been off?

14:59.364 --> 15:00.463
Wait, what?

15:00.465 --> 15:01.865
I listen to your
private conversations?

15:01.867 --> 15:02.899
Gotta go.

15:02.901 --> 15:04.801
- Wait.
- What?

15:04.803 --> 15:06.002
I don't like to
be wrong.

15:06.004 --> 15:07.170
It made sense, Harvey.

15:07.172 --> 15:08.605
Louis is the firm's
financial wizard.

15:08.607 --> 15:10.240
Look. Louis might not
have done it,

15:10.242 --> 15:12.042
but he can help me
figure out who did.

15:12.044 --> 15:14.377
You're going to ask Louis
for help on something this big?

15:14.379 --> 15:16.746
When a dog smells a bone,
he digs.

15:16.748 --> 15:17.881
Doesn't mean you
have to tell him

15:17.883 --> 15:19.950
what kind of bone
he's digging for.

15:19.952 --> 15:21.418
Just so we're clear,

15:21.420 --> 15:23.687
I'm gonna keep listening to
your private conversations.

15:23.689 --> 15:25.755
- Pickles.
- Peppers.

15:25.757 --> 15:26.756
Here you go.

15:26.758 --> 15:28.091
Here you go.
That's fine.

15:28.093 --> 15:29.326
Oh yeah, that girl Nikki
called me.

15:29.328 --> 15:30.927
Oh, that's awesome.

15:30.929 --> 15:32.629
I don't even know how she got
my number, it's weird.

15:32.631 --> 15:33.897
I do.

15:33.899 --> 15:36.366
I asked her out.
She wanted your number instead.

15:36.368 --> 15:38.935
I didn't tell her about
the <i>Curious George</i> thing.

15:38.937 --> 15:39.970
What?

15:39.972 --> 15:41.538
I don't know, it's--

15:41.540 --> 15:42.906
I just felt like I kind of
hit it off more

15:42.908 --> 15:44.040
with that Jenny girl,
that's all.

15:44.042 --> 15:45.041
The blonde?

15:45.043 --> 15:46.876
She's not even as hot.

15:46.878 --> 15:48.778
I liked her better.

15:48.780 --> 15:49.980
Well, you can't
do anything now.

15:49.982 --> 15:53.083
Girls have rules about
that kind of shit.

15:53.085 --> 15:54.618
Wait a minute.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.319
Are you--
is this a snake?

15:56.321 --> 15:58.054
Are you snaking my girl
right now?

15:58.056 --> 15:59.689
No, I already did.

15:59.691 --> 16:01.424
- You called her?
- Of course I did.

16:01.426 --> 16:02.759
- What a dick.
- What?

16:02.761 --> 16:04.094
- Son of a bitch.
- I--I don't have

16:04.096 --> 16:05.428
rules against that shit.
Okay.

16:05.430 --> 16:07.330
Aw, whatever. That Nikki girl's
pretty hot too.

16:07.332 --> 16:09.332
Yeah.

16:09.334 --> 16:12.269
Look at this clown.

16:12.271 --> 16:15.138
He walks like he's got
a rod up his ass.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.873
Nice haircut, guy.

16:16.875 --> 16:20.010
Man, if I ever look like that,
shoot me.

16:20.012 --> 16:22.612
Monica, you work late
all the time.

16:22.614 --> 16:24.714
I'm not 22.
You are.

16:24.716 --> 16:27.150
All I'm saying is, you work
80 hours a week

16:27.152 --> 16:28.585
while studying for the LSATs
every night.

16:28.587 --> 16:30.420
Well right, but that's because
this time next year

16:30.422 --> 16:32.622
I want to be in law school,
and five years from now

16:32.624 --> 16:33.923
I want to be a lawyer.

16:33.925 --> 16:35.492
Five years from now,
you're gonna be

16:35.494 --> 16:38.762
a kick-ass lawyer
at Pearson Hardman.

16:43.567 --> 16:46.970
How often does Louis
ask you out?

16:46.972 --> 16:48.305
Every single day.

16:48.307 --> 16:49.539
There are laws
to protect you from

16:49.541 --> 16:51.141
sexual harassment,
you know.

16:51.143 --> 16:53.376
Believe me, the day I need
a law to protect me from Louis

16:53.378 --> 16:55.578
is the day I stop
being a lawyer.

16:57.815 --> 16:59.449
Busy?

16:59.451 --> 17:01.017
Very funny, Harvey, let's get
to it, okay?

17:01.019 --> 17:02.185
Because you happen to be
interrupting

17:02.187 --> 17:04.320
my lunchtime sanctuary.

17:04.323 --> 17:06.423
You think I don't know
lunchtime sanctuary

17:06.425 --> 17:07.691
means staring at Monica?

17:07.693 --> 17:08.892
First of all,
I'll have you know that

17:08.894 --> 17:10.426
I have been coming here
way before her.

17:10.429 --> 17:12.996
And I will be coming here
every Thursday at 1:00 p.m.

17:12.998 --> 17:14.263
till the day I die.

17:14.266 --> 17:18.501
Now let me see your friend's
financials.

17:18.502 --> 17:19.703
Why are the names
all blacked out?

17:19.704 --> 17:21.570
Because of how
sensitive it is.

17:21.573 --> 17:23.506
How sensitive is it?

17:23.508 --> 17:25.275
He works at
a powerful firm.

17:25.277 --> 17:27.444
I can't tell you
which one.

17:27.445 --> 17:28.745
They have an embezzler.

17:28.747 --> 17:30.580
Ahh, so that's
what your

17:30.582 --> 17:32.982
closed-door meeting
with Jessica was about.

17:32.984 --> 17:34.451
We're being hired
by another firm.

17:34.453 --> 17:36.920
I'm sworn to secrecy.

17:36.922 --> 17:38.722
If we can figure out
who this is,

17:38.724 --> 17:41.324
a very big head
will roll.

17:41.326 --> 17:45.628
Where?
Hufton and Wood?

17:45.630 --> 17:47.564
Bagwell and Rose?

17:47.566 --> 17:50.233
Oh, come on. Those assholes
at Jacobson and Kearney?

17:53.437 --> 17:55.972
Look, I told you,
I was sworn to secrecy.

17:55.974 --> 17:59.642
My God, this is just like
a maze of raw data.

17:59.644 --> 18:00.977
Can you make any
sense of it?

18:00.979 --> 18:02.445
Yeah, I already have.

18:02.447 --> 18:04.848
Look at this.

18:04.850 --> 18:06.149
See?

18:06.151 --> 18:07.851
He's setting up this patsy
to take the fall.

18:07.853 --> 18:10.186
He's not even gonna see it
coming, what a "smuck."

18:10.188 --> 18:12.122
I'm sorry, did--
did you just say,

18:12.124 --> 18:13.656
what a "smuck?"

18:13.658 --> 18:16.993
No, I said
what a "smuck."

18:16.995 --> 18:18.094
You mean schmuck.

18:18.096 --> 18:19.662
Huh?

18:19.664 --> 18:20.997
You know a schmuck, right?

18:20.999 --> 18:22.031
"Smuck."

18:34.345 --> 18:35.478
Monica?

18:35.480 --> 18:36.913
Mike Ross.

18:36.915 --> 18:38.047
Can I join you?

18:38.049 --> 18:40.350
Chair's empty.

18:40.352 --> 18:41.684
I appreciate it.

18:41.686 --> 18:44.988
Rachel said this was about
one of my old cases?

18:44.990 --> 18:47.791
This is a lawsuit that we just
drew up in your name,

18:47.793 --> 18:51.394
seeking $10 million in damages
from Pearson Hardman.

18:51.396 --> 18:52.529
Should have
seen this coming.

18:52.531 --> 18:54.597
Five years ago
you got screwed.

18:54.599 --> 18:55.832
One way to put it.

18:55.834 --> 18:57.600
You had options
you didn't explore.

18:57.602 --> 18:58.968
And you're
exploring them for me.

18:58.970 --> 19:01.871
I can make what stopped you
before go away, yes.

19:01.873 --> 19:05.542
Harvey will
back your claim.

19:05.544 --> 19:06.576
What about Jessica?

19:06.578 --> 19:08.845
You don't need Jessica.

19:08.847 --> 19:11.981
Why are you
doing this?

19:11.983 --> 19:14.517
Does it matter?

19:14.519 --> 19:16.986
No. It doesn't.

19:16.988 --> 19:19.956
I don't want anything
to do with this.

19:19.958 --> 19:23.893
Last five years haven't been
easy for you, have they?

19:23.895 --> 19:26.029
You don't know
anything about me.

19:26.031 --> 19:27.797
I know you've been
working retail.

19:27.799 --> 19:29.966
It's a boutique
on Park Avenue, right?

19:29.968 --> 19:32.902
It's a good job, you're making
what, maybe 40 grand a year?

19:32.904 --> 19:34.204
This is Manhattan.

19:34.206 --> 19:36.739
What, are you covering rent
with that?

19:36.741 --> 19:39.042
So you're the new
attack dog.

19:39.044 --> 19:41.578
Well, Spot,
I'm not revisiting a story

19:41.580 --> 19:44.881
I spent the last five years
trying to forget.

19:44.883 --> 19:47.350
Just take it
with you.

19:47.352 --> 19:49.118
You may
change your mind.

19:49.120 --> 19:51.621
And if you call me,
I'll come fetch.

20:01.866 --> 20:03.967
- It's Daniel Hardman.
- What?

20:03.969 --> 20:05.435
He's been playing
a shell game.

20:05.437 --> 20:08.238
He's moving money out of one
account and into another.

20:08.240 --> 20:09.672
For an entire year.

20:09.674 --> 20:11.174
Your partner
sold you out.

20:11.176 --> 20:13.376
Daniel has never done
anything unethical.

20:13.378 --> 20:14.677
And the fact that
you don't like him--

20:14.679 --> 20:16.913
I know, isn't reason
to falsely accuse him.

20:16.915 --> 20:18.748
I'm not.

20:18.750 --> 20:21.618
You falsely accused Louis.

20:21.620 --> 20:23.419
I stake my career
on this.

20:23.421 --> 20:26.222
You are.

20:26.224 --> 20:27.624
He did it.

20:36.100 --> 20:39.135
Shit.

20:39.137 --> 20:40.803
He did.

20:40.805 --> 20:43.840
You have to go
to the D.A.

20:43.842 --> 20:46.776
I'm going to Daniel.

20:46.778 --> 20:48.978
Who's not doing their job
like a man now?

20:48.980 --> 20:51.080
I'm giving him the courtesy
of explaining himself.

20:51.082 --> 20:54.050
You shouldn't.

20:54.052 --> 20:55.852
What you do
if it were me?

21:39.535 --> 21:40.767
- Hi.
- Hey.

21:40.769 --> 21:43.103
- Come in.
- Oh. Thanks.

21:43.105 --> 21:46.039
Oh...

21:46.041 --> 21:47.674
Are those for me,
probably?

21:47.676 --> 21:48.942
Yeah. That's a thing,
right?

21:48.944 --> 21:50.210
Uh, bringing flowers
for the roommate of

21:50.212 --> 21:51.645
the girl you're taking--

21:51.647 --> 21:55.082
you're just gonna take
one of those, okay.

21:55.084 --> 21:57.451
Who's gonna tell her?
You? Lieutenant Weinberg?

21:57.453 --> 21:58.619
That's from

21:58.621 --> 21:59.953
- <i>A Few Good Men.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

21:59.955 --> 22:03.123
Yeah. I get HBO.

22:03.125 --> 22:04.358
I love you!

22:04.360 --> 22:07.011
Uh, Nikki is gonna be out
any minute, so--

22:07.036 --> 22:09.341
Am I dressed okay, for her?

22:09.665 --> 22:12.599
Yeah, uh, you look fine.

22:12.601 --> 22:13.867
- Good?
- Yeah.

22:13.869 --> 22:15.669
Would--can you
me the truth?

22:15.671 --> 22:17.504
You don't want
the truth.

22:17.506 --> 22:19.039
"'Cause deep down
in places you don't

22:19.041 --> 22:20.674
"talk about at
parties, you want me

22:20.676 --> 22:23.043
"on that wall,
you <i>need</i> me on that wall--"

22:23.045 --> 22:24.745
Hey, Nikki.

22:24.747 --> 22:27.080
Hi.

22:27.082 --> 22:29.082
Uh, wow.

22:29.084 --> 22:32.152
Those look beautiful.

22:32.154 --> 22:33.453
Ohuh,
yeah--um,

22:33.455 --> 22:35.255
so--so, do you.

22:35.257 --> 22:36.757
So they-
I'm gonna go

22:36.759 --> 22:38.243
put these in water.
Okay.

22:38.244 --> 22:39.560
You liar.

22:39.561 --> 22:40.925
Look at her.

22:40.950 --> 22:42.950
You did want to look perfect
on your first date.

22:42.959 --> 22:44.992
Yeah, I do.

22:45.534 --> 22:46.633
Ready?

22:46.635 --> 22:48.302
Yeah, I'm ready.
Are--

22:48.304 --> 22:49.369
are you ready?
- Yeah.

22:49.371 --> 22:51.171
Then we, ready.

22:51.173 --> 22:52.539
For dinner.
Everyone's ready,

22:52.541 --> 22:53.707
isn't that great? - Good Night.

22:53.709 --> 22:55.642
That great?

23:03.284 --> 23:04.551
Something I can
help you with?

23:04.553 --> 23:05.719
Yon help me
understand why

23:05.721 --> 23:09.022
you've been stealing
from our clients.

23:09.024 --> 23:10.090
Jessica, I can--

23:10.092 --> 23:13.093
Oh, God damn
Daniel.

23:14.919 --> 23:16.804
It was for Alicia.

23:16.829 --> 23:18.259
She's dying.

23:19.730 --> 23:22.364
What?

23:22.475 --> 23:25.243
Breast cancer.

23:25.245 --> 23:27.078
Stage four.

23:27.080 --> 23:29.881
Why didn't you say
anything?

23:29.883 --> 23:31.582
She found a lump
a year ago.

23:31.584 --> 23:33.694
It was the worst day
of our lives.

23:36.147 --> 23:38.111
I have no words.

23:40.026 --> 23:42.193
I thought I could
handle it myself.

23:45.163 --> 23:47.498
And the money?

23:47.500 --> 23:49.534
Treatments.
Not covered by insurance.

23:49.536 --> 23:50.635
Why not?

23:50.637 --> 23:52.537
They're not
in the books.

23:52.539 --> 23:54.138
But I don't care.

23:54.163 --> 23:56.252
She's not dying because
I didn't spend the money.

23:57.944 --> 24:02.547
You stole $1/2 million.

24:02.549 --> 24:06.651
I don't expect you
to forgive me.

24:06.653 --> 24:10.221
What do you expect?

24:10.223 --> 24:13.724
I honestly don't know.

24:18.237 --> 24:20.512
Wild Maine salmon,
braised fennel

24:20.526 --> 24:23.394
mushroom polenta,
arugula salad,

24:23.396 --> 24:25.791
and do you really need
to keep doing this?

24:25.796 --> 24:27.462
U really are a genius.

24:27.464 --> 24:28.897
Sexy, right?

24:28.899 --> 24:31.066
What'd you get
on your SATs?

24:31.068 --> 24:32.887
Ooh, 1590.

24:33.096 --> 24:34.635
Yeah, it was an ambiguous
question, I don't know.

24:34.660 --> 24:36.278
I really don't like
to talk about it.

24:37.271 --> 24:38.837
Oh, no, no, no.
Here, let me get that,

24:38.839 --> 24:40.706
c'mon.
Parents' plastic.

24:40.708 --> 24:41.774
They're cool.

24:41.776 --> 24:43.108
Cool.

24:47.781 --> 24:49.408
Listen, um...

24:50.723 --> 24:52.134
Why don't we go back
to your place, cause

24:52.353 --> 24:53.852
I'm live in Brooklyn,
and I kinda in

24:53.854 --> 24:55.154
a strange roommate
situation--

24:55.156 --> 24:57.256
I want to
pay you $1000

24:57.258 --> 24:59.858
to take the LSATs for me.

24:59.860 --> 25:01.894
Oh.

25:01.896 --> 25:04.063
What?

25:10.170 --> 25:11.603
That's why you snaked me
from Jenny.

25:11.605 --> 25:12.738
I don't know what you're

25:12.740 --> 25:14.606
talking about.
Unbelievable.

25:14.608 --> 25:16.809
We're not all
born geniuses.

25:16.811 --> 25:17.910
And I need your help.

25:17.912 --> 25:19.745
Yeah, you might not
be a genius,

25:19.747 --> 25:21.747
but you know exactly
what you're doing.

25:25.352 --> 25:28.053
And you're not getting
my help.

25:28.055 --> 25:31.123
Come on.

25:31.125 --> 25:32.558
What do you want?

25:32.560 --> 25:34.026
Oh, I don't want
anything.

25:34.028 --> 25:36.729
Because I'm not
your trained monkey.

25:36.731 --> 25:38.464
Tell your mommy thanks
for dinner.

25:38.466 --> 25:41.767
Grammy!

25:41.769 --> 25:43.235
Oh my God,
what's the matter?

25:43.237 --> 25:44.770
Bob, what happened?
Relax, Mike.

25:44.772 --> 25:46.972
Edith's fine, I'm just gonna
go get her a glass of water.

25:46.974 --> 25:48.674
Grammy, here, look at me.
What happened?

25:48.676 --> 25:50.275
I don't know.
I think the floor was wet.

25:50.277 --> 25:52.044
The floor was wet,
how did the floor get wet?

25:52.046 --> 25:53.846
Well, it happened fast.

25:53.848 --> 25:55.214
But I'm okay.

25:55.216 --> 25:57.416
But, what are you
doing here?

25:57.418 --> 25:59.752
I thought you
had a date.

25:59.754 --> 26:03.789
Uh, it di--
no, it didn't work out.

26:03.791 --> 26:05.824
So, you came to see
your grandmother.

26:05.826 --> 26:07.493
That's not normal,
Michael.

26:07.495 --> 26:09.395
Rea--are we gonna do this,
right now?

26:09.397 --> 26:10.496
- Hey.
- Thank you, Bob,

26:10.498 --> 26:11.864
I really appreciate it.

26:11.866 --> 26:14.733
That's what neighbors
are for.

26:14.735 --> 26:16.335
Here, you drink that,
and we'll be right back.

26:16.337 --> 26:18.570
Okay?

26:18.572 --> 26:20.739
- For what it's worth...
- Uh-huh.

26:20.741 --> 26:22.608
The floor wasn't
wet.

26:22.610 --> 26:25.611
You know, if I were you, I'd get
full-time care for Edith.

26:32.018 --> 26:34.620
- Are you crazy?
- Did you hear me?

26:34.622 --> 26:36.855
His wife's
dying of cancer.

26:36.857 --> 26:38.257
So you're going to
let him walk?

26:38.259 --> 26:39.658
No, nobody's walking.

26:39.660 --> 26:41.727
The firm's taking out a loan
against its assets.

26:41.729 --> 26:43.062
Daniel will pay it back.

26:43.064 --> 26:45.330
Great. My dad has gout,
can I have $1 million?

26:45.332 --> 26:46.832
Coldhearted son of a bitch.

26:46.834 --> 26:50.302
You know those Tuesday lunches
at the Harvard Club?

26:50.304 --> 26:51.937
He's taking Alicia
to chemo.

26:51.939 --> 26:53.705
He stole from our clients,

26:53.707 --> 26:55.140
which means he's stealing
from us.

26:55.142 --> 26:57.376
When it was Louis,
you were ready to break him down

26:57.378 --> 26:58.510
and crack him open.

26:58.512 --> 27:00.646
Daniel is the reason
why I'm here.

27:00.648 --> 27:01.980
He plucked me
from the bullpen

27:01.982 --> 27:03.515
when I didn't know my ass
from my elbow.

27:03.517 --> 27:05.584
He saw a star
to hitch his wagon to.

27:05.586 --> 27:08.220
This is Manhattan,
Harvey.

27:08.222 --> 27:11.523
How many black women do you see
with their name on the door?

27:11.525 --> 27:13.125
You know what, he was smart
to put your name first.

27:13.127 --> 27:15.661
That way you might not notice
that you'd always be number two.

27:15.663 --> 27:17.296
- Careful, Harvey.
- Then again,

27:17.298 --> 27:19.498
maybe you're okay staying
number two--Scottie Pippen...

27:19.500 --> 27:20.632
Don't pull that shit on me.

27:20.634 --> 27:23.469
We made a deal,
and I honored it.

27:23.471 --> 27:27.206
It's time for you
to honor it.

27:27.208 --> 27:30.442
Wow,
a man's wife's dying,

27:30.444 --> 27:34.546
and the first words out
of your mouth are "you owe me."

27:34.548 --> 27:35.981
Who's the bad guy now?

27:57.639 --> 27:59.657
You asked me what
it's gonna take.

27:59.724 --> 28:01.190
It's gonna take $5,000.

28:01.192 --> 28:03.960
- Keep your voice down.
- Why, am I making you nervous?

28:03.962 --> 28:05.495
Yes.

28:05.497 --> 28:08.264
Good. Now you know
how I'm gonna feel.

28:08.266 --> 28:10.099
You're asking me
to expose myself

28:10.101 --> 28:11.501
so that you can go
make a fortune.

28:11.503 --> 28:12.902
So either you figure out
how to pay me,

28:12.904 --> 28:14.671
or you roll the dice
on your own.

28:14.673 --> 28:17.507
But trust me when I tell you,
these tests aren't easy.

28:17.509 --> 28:20.877
Well, they are for me.

28:20.879 --> 28:23.046
Okay.

28:23.048 --> 28:25.415
Good.

28:25.417 --> 28:29.018
What made you change
your mind?

28:29.020 --> 28:31.521
None of your business.

28:35.659 --> 28:37.427
- You're not Monica.
- Oh, no, I'm--

28:37.429 --> 28:39.429
- Rachel Zane.
- How did you know that?

28:39.431 --> 28:40.763
I'm Donna.
I know everything.

28:40.765 --> 28:43.166
- Everything?
- You started three months ago,

28:43.168 --> 28:44.534
you have a peach yogurt
every morning,

28:44.536 --> 28:45.935
you've got a cute pair
of suede pumps

28:45.937 --> 28:47.704
I totally plan on stealing,

28:47.706 --> 28:49.005
and your father's
Robert Zane,

28:49.007 --> 28:52.308
name partner at Rand,
Kaldor, and Zane.

28:52.310 --> 28:55.078
And, apparently, you don't like
people knowing who your dad is.

28:55.080 --> 28:57.347
Well, they just--
they treat you differently.

28:57.349 --> 28:59.182
Your secret's safe
with me.

28:59.184 --> 29:00.883
No, it doesn't really
matter.

29:00.885 --> 29:03.052
I won't be here that long.
It is the cafeteria?

29:03.054 --> 29:05.054
Because it is <i>way</i> better
than it used to be.

29:05.056 --> 29:07.023
Nope.
I live for foie gras Fridays.

29:07.025 --> 29:10.293
- They don't have that.
- Don't they?

29:10.295 --> 29:13.129
You're weird.
We'll be friends.

29:13.131 --> 29:14.897
Anyway, I should go.

29:14.899 --> 29:16.466
I'm just gonna leave
this stuff here for Monica.

29:16.468 --> 29:17.667
She should be back
pretty soon.

29:17.669 --> 29:20.403
She just has Tuesday pilates
at Chelsea Pier.

29:20.405 --> 29:22.639
Every Tuesday?

29:22.641 --> 29:26.909
Now, I thought
you knew everything.

29:26.911 --> 29:28.444
I do.

29:35.786 --> 29:38.488
What are you
so bouncy about?

29:38.490 --> 29:43.459
You're gonna be so happy
that I listen to your intercom.

29:46.231 --> 29:47.497
Who is it?

29:47.499 --> 29:50.566
Room service.

29:50.568 --> 29:52.735
What are you doing here?

29:52.737 --> 29:55.371
Delivering champagne.
I see you can afford it

29:55.373 --> 29:57.106
since the money you've been
stealing from our clients

29:57.108 --> 29:59.509
hasn't been going to
your wife's cancer treatments.

29:59.511 --> 30:00.710
Hey, Monica,
how's it going?

30:00.712 --> 30:04.647
- Harvey.
- Daniel and I need a minute.

30:04.649 --> 30:07.750
Letter of resignation.

30:07.752 --> 30:09.385
You're gonna sign it,

30:09.387 --> 30:11.454
and then name Jessica
as your successor.

30:11.456 --> 30:12.755
I don't think so.

30:12.757 --> 30:14.824
Unflinching in the face
of defeat.

30:14.826 --> 30:16.092
It's not defeat.

30:16.094 --> 30:17.927
You come after me
for embezzlement,

30:17.929 --> 30:20.963
every Pearson Hardman client
you've got is gone.

30:20.965 --> 30:23.800
Which is why Jessica
won't let me do that.

30:23.802 --> 30:25.535
Then why are you here?

30:25.537 --> 30:26.869
Waiting for your wife.

30:26.871 --> 30:28.471
What are you talking about?

30:28.473 --> 30:29.806
She's invited
to a fund raiser.

30:29.808 --> 30:31.974
She'll be at the front desk
in three minutes.

30:31.976 --> 30:34.444
You don't sign, they'll send her
up to this room.

30:34.446 --> 30:36.345
You do sign, they'll send her
to another room.

30:36.347 --> 30:38.981
You dragged a woman
racked with cancer here

30:38.983 --> 30:40.383
to blackmail me?

30:40.385 --> 30:44.721
You think it's me
she's gonna have issue with?

30:44.723 --> 30:45.988
You goddamn bastard.

30:45.990 --> 30:48.191
Says the man cheating
on his dying wife.

30:48.193 --> 30:51.961
- You don't know anything.
- I do.

30:51.963 --> 30:54.897
I've seen you with her,
and I know you love her.

30:54.899 --> 30:57.500
And this has nothing to do
with that.

30:57.502 --> 31:00.336
I also know that you don't want
the rest of Alicia's life

31:00.338 --> 31:02.171
spent picturing this.

31:02.173 --> 31:04.907
If she wasn't sick,
she could probably get over it.

31:04.909 --> 31:08.878
She's not getting
any better, Daniel.

31:08.880 --> 31:11.481
You have two minutes.

31:11.483 --> 31:15.485
It's your call.

31:25.362 --> 31:27.497
There's something
I think you should know.

31:27.499 --> 31:30.733
Please.

31:30.735 --> 31:33.269
Mike Ross had lunch
with Monica Eton today.

31:33.271 --> 31:35.938
I saw him hand her
a filing.

31:35.940 --> 31:38.040
And why do you think
this concerns me?

31:38.042 --> 31:39.342
I just think that
their meeting

31:39.344 --> 31:40.643
on the eve
of the firm's vote suggests

31:40.645 --> 31:42.712
that Jessica's making
a move.

31:42.714 --> 31:45.815
You've been good to me
since you've been back.

31:48.552 --> 31:52.221
She hasn't.

31:52.223 --> 31:54.957
Do what you will.

32:05.536 --> 32:08.137
About time.
I wasn't sure you'd make it.

32:08.139 --> 32:09.872
Especially since
you didn't give me a reason.

32:09.874 --> 32:13.943
I've got about 5,000 reasons.

32:13.945 --> 32:16.646
We'll be fine.

32:16.648 --> 32:18.381
Oh, my God, you're high.

32:18.383 --> 32:20.817
- I'm fine.
- Are you crazy?

32:20.819 --> 32:22.251
I'm about to do
something illegal, okay?

32:22.253 --> 32:24.320
It helps calm me down.
Great, you'll be calm.

32:24.322 --> 32:26.422
How the hell are you gonna
handle the test?

32:26.424 --> 32:27.423
I don't know,
maybe the same way I handled

32:27.425 --> 32:28.491
your little quiz
the other night.

32:28.493 --> 32:30.927
- You were high.
- And drunk.

32:30.929 --> 32:33.462
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got a test to take.

32:33.464 --> 32:35.565
And I've gotta miss a couple
of questions on purpose.

33:08.465 --> 33:11.467
It's done.
Hardman's gone.

33:14.705 --> 33:17.240
Harvey...

33:17.242 --> 33:20.343
What is it?

33:20.345 --> 33:23.813
I don't know how
to say this.

33:23.815 --> 33:26.048
Just say it, Donna.
What?

33:26.050 --> 33:31.988
Your dad...
he had a heart attack.

33:46.103 --> 33:49.005
Harvey, I'm so sorry.

33:52.743 --> 33:54.710
It's okay.

33:54.712 --> 33:56.512
Oh, my God.

34:15.889 --> 34:18.558
- Good morning, Monica.
- Jessica.

34:18.560 --> 34:20.893
You look tired. Did you get
much rest last night?

34:20.895 --> 34:23.529
- I want to explain.
- I'm not here for excuses.

34:23.531 --> 34:25.063
Then why are you here?

34:25.065 --> 34:27.567
- To see you off.
- My relationship with Daniel

34:27.569 --> 34:29.768
has nothing to do
with my work here.

34:29.771 --> 34:32.471
I need to know
I can trust my people.

34:32.473 --> 34:34.273
You're not my people.

34:34.275 --> 34:36.475
You can't fire me.

34:36.476 --> 34:37.944
I'll sue for wrongful
termination.

34:37.946 --> 34:39.512
Which will lead me
to implicate you

34:39.514 --> 34:40.880
in Daniel's crimes.

34:40.882 --> 34:43.716
- I had nothing to do with that.
- Didn't you?

34:43.717 --> 34:47.186
Diamond earrings,
diamond bracelet,

34:47.188 --> 34:52.058
and trips to,
let's see now...

34:52.060 --> 34:56.996
Mexico...France...
Hong Kong.

34:56.998 --> 34:58.564
Hope you liked that one.

34:58.566 --> 35:00.666
- I didn't know.
- I don't care.

35:00.668 --> 35:03.135
You are
a Harvard-educated lawyer.

35:03.137 --> 35:04.670
Do you think that a jury
will believe

35:04.672 --> 35:08.441
you had no idea
where that money came from?

35:08.443 --> 35:11.544
Don't do this.

35:11.546 --> 35:14.580
Louis will accept
your resignation,

35:14.582 --> 35:18.417
and I will never
see you here again.

35:23.590 --> 35:27.126
I expected a fight,
but not a dirty one.

35:27.128 --> 35:28.227
I don't know what
you're talking about.

35:28.229 --> 35:30.196
Mike Ross met
with Monica Eton.

35:30.198 --> 35:31.564
And what does that have
to do with me?

35:31.566 --> 35:33.866
I am disappointed that
you felt the need to go there.

35:33.868 --> 35:35.601
I'm disappointed
you think I did.

35:35.603 --> 35:38.204
You really expect me
to believe that you didn't--

35:38.206 --> 35:39.472
Stop right there!

35:39.474 --> 35:41.173
You know,
you might fight dirty,

35:41.175 --> 35:43.776
and Harvey might fight dirty,
but I don't.

35:45.445 --> 35:47.413
What the hell are you doing?

35:47.415 --> 35:50.016
Trying to get Monica Eton to
file a sexual harassment suit

35:50.018 --> 35:51.350
against Daniel Hardman?

35:51.352 --> 35:52.818
Okay she left because
of their affair,

35:52.820 --> 35:55.087
which he paid for
with embezzled money.

35:55.089 --> 35:57.790
- That was five years ago.
- And her life fell apart!

35:57.792 --> 35:58.958
I know you think
you're trying to help me,

35:58.960 --> 36:01.293
but drop it, immediately.

36:04.965 --> 36:07.767
Wow. That's what
all this was about?

36:07.769 --> 36:09.301
Nice performance.

36:09.303 --> 36:10.469
I'm trying to help Jessica.

36:10.471 --> 36:11.771
Mike, you cannot
keep me in the dark.

36:11.773 --> 36:13.172
Not when you're the one
asking me for help.

36:13.174 --> 36:14.740
Couldn't take the chance
that you wouldn't help.

36:14.742 --> 36:16.308
You told me it was about
one of Monica's old cases.

36:16.310 --> 36:17.743
You lied like it's
second nature.

36:17.745 --> 36:19.478
Our backs are
against the wall.

36:19.480 --> 36:21.480
I did what I had to do.
And you're proud of that?

36:21.482 --> 36:22.982
Rachel, sometimes
you have to cross a line

36:22.984 --> 36:25.184
to do the right thing.
Wow...

36:25.186 --> 36:28.621
Harvey has really
rubbed off on you.

36:28.623 --> 36:31.924
I didn't learn that
from Harvey.

36:31.926 --> 36:34.460
Heh.

36:34.462 --> 36:36.729
Holy shit, dude.

36:36.731 --> 36:38.130
Pays to be a nerd.

36:38.132 --> 36:40.633
Yeah, but you still
don't get the girls.

36:40.635 --> 36:41.701
I don't know,
I guess I'm gonna use this

36:41.703 --> 36:43.602
to get my grandma
some help.

36:43.604 --> 36:45.337
Too bad it was
a one-time-only deal.

36:45.339 --> 36:46.472
Actually,
she has three friends

36:46.474 --> 36:48.374
who want to use
my services, so...

36:48.376 --> 36:50.009
- Oh, good.
- We're in business.

36:50.011 --> 36:51.010
'Cause you're gonna need
to start paying

36:51.012 --> 36:54.213
all the rent around here.

36:54.215 --> 36:55.648
What?

36:55.650 --> 36:56.949
Oh, did you think
you were the only one

36:56.951 --> 36:58.050
stepping up his game?

36:58.052 --> 37:00.486
Meaning?

37:07.928 --> 37:10.229
What? Trevor, no, no, no.
Not a good idea.

37:10.231 --> 37:12.498
No.
Which is why I'm moving out.

37:12.500 --> 37:14.200
Unless you want in,
in which case,

37:14.202 --> 37:15.801
you know,
I'm still moving out.

37:15.803 --> 37:17.002
But we could go together--

37:17.004 --> 37:19.205
move into a much,
much nicer apartment.

37:19.207 --> 37:21.073
That's Jenny.

37:21.075 --> 37:22.575
First date.

37:22.577 --> 37:23.943
Could you not tell her
about this?

37:23.945 --> 37:25.578
Go get the door.

37:25.580 --> 37:27.246
Unbelievable.

37:30.550 --> 37:31.684
Jenny.

37:31.686 --> 37:33.552
Aren't you a sight
for sore eyes.

37:38.759 --> 37:41.761
Daniel came in last night
to pick up his things.

37:41.763 --> 37:42.962
Threw a phone at my head.

37:42.964 --> 37:44.964
You duck,
or is his aim that bad?

37:44.966 --> 37:47.566
- He throws like a girl.
- I'm not surprised.

37:47.568 --> 37:48.901
You needed me?

37:48.903 --> 37:50.102
I wanted you to be
the first to know.

37:50.104 --> 37:51.637
We have a new partner.

37:51.639 --> 37:54.240
Andrew McCutcheon.
Solid candidate.

37:54.242 --> 37:56.475
A simple thank you
would suffice.

37:56.477 --> 37:59.245
Me thank you?
Never.

37:59.247 --> 38:01.180
Well, I have a partners
meeting in five minutes.

38:01.182 --> 38:05.985
I'm gonna break the news
that I'm taking Daniel's office.

38:05.987 --> 38:08.788
- Who's taking yours?
- I'm looking at him.

38:12.025 --> 38:14.293
Jessica...

38:14.295 --> 38:17.930
Thank you.

38:17.932 --> 38:19.265
One last tip.

38:19.267 --> 38:23.135
Don't let Louis in here
after hours.

38:38.618 --> 38:40.953
Finally an office big enough
for your balls.

38:40.955 --> 38:43.022
Okay, I am not touching
that one.

38:43.024 --> 38:44.523
You would if you had
bigger balls.

38:44.525 --> 38:47.593
Hold on a sec, did you listen
on Jessica's intercom?

38:47.595 --> 38:49.628
- No. She told me.
- Before me?

38:49.630 --> 38:51.730
Well, I was the one
to figure it out about Daniel.

38:51.732 --> 38:52.998
Oh, and how did she
know that?

38:53.000 --> 38:58.137
Let's just focus
on what's important.

38:58.139 --> 39:00.873
You just made partner.

39:00.875 --> 39:04.543
We just made partner.

39:04.545 --> 39:06.512
I'll grab the can opener.

39:06.514 --> 39:08.180
Whoa, whoa,
that's pre-trial ritual.

39:08.182 --> 39:10.649
We're making an exception.

39:10.651 --> 39:12.518
- I'll get the thumbtacks.
- Two dozen?

39:12.520 --> 39:14.553
- Three dozen.
- Ooh, going for the record!

39:18.892 --> 39:20.960
- Zoe.
- Harvey.

39:20.962 --> 39:22.294
Is word out already?

39:22.296 --> 39:23.796
Word about what?

39:23.798 --> 39:25.731
Oh, don't be coy.
I just made partner.

39:25.733 --> 39:27.233
You're here
to congratulate me.

39:27.235 --> 39:31.637
I knew it.
It was Hardman, wasn't it?

39:33.673 --> 39:35.174
What do you want me
to say?

39:35.176 --> 39:39.378
Nothing.

39:39.380 --> 39:41.080
I know how it is
around here.

39:41.082 --> 39:43.349
Secrets and lies--
standard procedure.

39:43.351 --> 39:44.884
I didn't build
the sandbox, Zoe.

39:44.886 --> 39:46.719
No, you just like
to play in it.

39:46.721 --> 39:48.487
- And you don't?
- No.

39:48.489 --> 39:49.889
And I don't like watching
what it's doing

39:49.891 --> 39:51.257
to a man I care about.

39:51.259 --> 39:53.659
- Zoe--
- I'm leaving.

39:53.661 --> 39:55.828
Today's my last day.
Because of this?

39:55.830 --> 39:57.563
Look, I did what I did
for the good of the firm.

39:57.565 --> 40:00.199
You think that's
what I'm talking about?

40:00.201 --> 40:02.334
Do you know what this is?

40:02.336 --> 40:05.104
It's my condolences,

40:05.106 --> 40:07.740
which I expected to leave
on your desk,

40:07.742 --> 40:09.675
because I thought you'd be out
mourning your father.

40:09.677 --> 40:11.744
- I had--
- What, bigger fish to fry?

40:11.746 --> 40:13.879
Don't you see?
That's what this place does.

40:13.881 --> 40:15.714
There's always bigger fish.

40:15.716 --> 40:19.585
I am dealing how I deal.

40:19.587 --> 40:21.353
Harvey,
you've lost your way.

41:48.241 --> 41:50.242
How'd it go yesterday?

41:50.244 --> 41:52.578
Fine.
Mike pull it off?

41:52.580 --> 41:54.680
- Yep.
- He suspect you were in on it?

41:54.682 --> 41:56.982
- Nope.
- Well, now they know.

41:56.984 --> 41:58.450
Gonna swing us some votes.

41:58.452 --> 42:00.753
We threw Daniel's ass out
once, we'll do it again.

42:00.755 --> 42:04.523
- Damn right.
- One more thing.

42:04.525 --> 42:06.759
I'm getting Donna back.

42:06.784 --> 42:10.784
