WEBVTT

02:01.033 --> 02:02.687
- Hey, Harry!

02:02.731 --> 02:04.254
I thought that was your bike.

02:07.649 --> 02:09.781
- You should have called me.

02:09.825 --> 02:12.784
I was sitting at home
doing a bunch of nothing.

02:12.828 --> 02:14.960
I went by your house, but
I saw your brother's car.

02:18.312 --> 02:20.140
Well, hello, Marissa.

02:20.183 --> 02:21.967
I've missed you.

02:22.011 --> 02:23.621
And jackpot.

02:26.015 --> 02:28.452
Well, I can't stay for long,
'cause my grandma's in town.

02:28.496 --> 02:30.715
And my mom forgot to
pick up her foot cream,

02:30.759 --> 02:32.282
so I was just passing by--

02:33.805 --> 02:37.200
Jesus Christ, your face.

02:37.244 --> 02:39.028
Did Billy do that to you?

02:40.421 --> 02:41.422
- Uh-huh.

02:44.076 --> 02:45.208
Got him back pretty good though.

02:47.079 --> 02:48.864
I think I even gave
him a black eye.

02:48.907 --> 02:50.866
- Yeah?

02:50.909 --> 02:52.868
With, uh--with big
brothers like that, huh?

02:56.263 --> 02:58.047
Want me to go home,
pack you a bag?

03:00.092 --> 03:01.137
- You think I should run?

03:03.226 --> 03:04.662
A lot of good that
did me the last time.

03:07.839 --> 03:09.537
- You wanna spend the
night at my place then?

03:09.580 --> 03:11.234
Let him sleep it
off or whatever?

03:11.278 --> 03:12.627
- Think I wanna sit around
with your mom

03:12.670 --> 03:14.237
and your old ass grandma?

03:14.281 --> 03:16.065
- You'll get used to it.

03:16.108 --> 03:18.720
- No, thanks.

03:18.763 --> 03:20.243
- Want me to fuck
him up for you?

03:23.377 --> 03:25.379
- Couldn't fuck up a June bug,
you fucking dildo.

03:25.422 --> 03:27.294
- Fuck you up if
you don't watch it.

03:27.337 --> 03:29.426
Come on, you want some, huh?
Huh?

03:29.470 --> 03:31.341
-  Fuck you, Smitty.

03:31.385 --> 03:32.516
- Fuck you, too, Harry.

03:34.823 --> 03:37.478
Well, I, uh, better get going.

03:37.521 --> 03:40.263
My mom is gonna kill me
if I don't get back soon,

03:40.307 --> 03:41.917
and grandma can be a real bear
when her feet get sore.

03:41.960 --> 03:44.659
So, uh...gross.

03:47.139 --> 03:48.358
Maybe this will cheer you up.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.842
Harry?

03:53.885 --> 03:55.235
You sure you're good?

03:59.587 --> 04:01.893
I'm around if you need me.

04:01.937 --> 04:03.634
And don't eat all
my peanut butter cups!

04:43.674 --> 04:45.154
- S--Smitty?

04:50.638 --> 04:51.465
- Whoa!

04:53.031 --> 04:55.251
I told you I wasn't
through with you

04:55.295 --> 04:57.297
when your bitch ass ran away.

04:57.340 --> 04:59.429
- Please, Billy,
I said I was sorry.

04:59.473 --> 05:00.865
- Not sorry enough.

05:00.909 --> 05:02.171
Not yet anyway.

05:02.214 --> 05:03.259
- Please, Billy, come on!

05:03.303 --> 05:04.478
No!

05:04.521 --> 05:06.654
Billy, I'll fix the dent,
I swear to God.

05:06.697 --> 05:07.916
- Oh, I know you will.

05:07.959 --> 05:11.180
But right now, I'm just--uh,

05:11.223 --> 05:12.964
I'm just collecting
what I'm owed.

05:13.008 --> 05:13.965
- Ah!

05:20.494 --> 05:21.973
What are you gonna do, huh?

05:22.017 --> 05:24.019
You filthy piece of shit!
- Stop, please!

05:24.062 --> 05:25.934
- BILLY: I'm gonna break you!
- Billy, stop!

05:28.153 --> 05:29.285
- BILLY: Come back here!

05:29.329 --> 05:31.722
Come and get your beating!

05:41.036 --> 05:42.429
You're dead, Harold!

05:45.388 --> 05:47.564
Fucking dead!

05:47.608 --> 05:49.523
Harold!

05:49.566 --> 05:53.048
I'm coming for you!

05:53.091 --> 05:56.660
I'll fucking kill you!

05:56.704 --> 05:58.183
Better run!

06:04.102 --> 06:06.061
- BILLY: Harold!

06:24.645 --> 06:26.864
- BILLY: I'll fucking kill you!

06:50.671 --> 06:52.412
- Uh!

06:58.983 --> 07:01.986
- BILLY: Harold,
I'm gonna find you!

07:10.691 --> 07:13.041
-  God!

07:13.084 --> 07:14.956
I'm gonna
fucking kill you this time!

07:25.967 --> 07:27.708
- BILLY: Harold!

07:37.326 --> 07:40.329
- BILLY: Harold!

07:40.372 --> 07:41.678
Where'd you go?

08:04.048 --> 08:06.616
- Help! Help! Let me in!

08:07.922 --> 08:09.532
- Please, please!

08:22.893 --> 08:24.329
- Billy, I'm sorry!

08:28.203 --> 08:29.378
Billy?

08:41.216 --> 08:42.913
- What the fuck?

08:52.009 --> 08:53.750
- BILLY: Harold,
where'd you go?

09:03.151 --> 09:05.762
You are fucking dead
when you come home!

09:09.287 --> 09:11.376
You little piece of shit!

10:03.690 --> 10:05.387
- Ah!

11:06.753 --> 11:10.321
- "There's no way to
explain what's happened.

11:10.365 --> 11:14.064
But after my Mavis died--
- MAN: But after my Mavis died,

11:14.108 --> 11:18.416
I grew terribly lonely.

11:18.460 --> 11:21.855
My Mavis had finally
succumbed to her illness.

11:21.898 --> 11:24.988
And so after nearly
40 years of wedded bliss,

11:25.032 --> 11:27.469
it was time to say goodbye.

11:27.512 --> 11:30.690
And what was harder than
anything in the days and months

11:30.733 --> 11:34.606
that followed, harder than I
could've possibly ever imagined,

11:34.650 --> 11:36.260
was the loneliness.

11:36.304 --> 11:39.568
A loneliness that existed in
every nook and cranny

11:39.611 --> 11:42.876
of the life me and my Mavis
had built together.

11:46.706 --> 11:50.797
- So lonely that I decided
to create...

11:50.840 --> 11:52.668
a companion.

11:57.238 --> 11:59.936
- Working a farm makes
a man quite handy.

11:59.980 --> 12:02.983
There ain't nothing you don't
encounter over the years.

12:03.026 --> 12:06.073
Mavis herself used to say,
"There weren't nothing

12:06.116 --> 12:09.163
I couldn't build if I just
had the right tools."

12:09.206 --> 12:12.079
Truth be told, it
was kinda fun, too.

12:12.122 --> 12:13.776
Took my mind off things.

12:13.820 --> 12:16.083
Lost myself into working nights.

12:16.126 --> 12:19.869
It began to occupy my mind
during every waking hour,

12:19.913 --> 12:22.002
an obsession I couldn't shake.

12:22.045 --> 12:25.788
I was nearly there, but
something was still missing.

12:25.832 --> 12:27.616
Which is when I found it.

12:27.659 --> 12:31.576
And wouldn't you know it, it
came from my Mavis herself.

12:31.620 --> 12:35.058
An old heart for
my new companion.

13:09.571 --> 13:12.792
- Something about the
combination of ingredients,

13:12.835 --> 13:15.359
perhaps the strange bones
from the field

13:15.403 --> 13:18.536
or the Valentine's heart
my Mavis had given me,

13:18.580 --> 13:22.540
perhaps even my own desires
had given it life.

13:32.812 --> 13:36.467
And for a short time...

13:36.511 --> 13:38.295
it was lovely.

14:24.820 --> 14:26.430
- GIRL:

14:42.751 --> 14:45.841
- But as men wiser than me
have said...

14:45.885 --> 14:48.365
nothing good lasts forever.

14:53.066 --> 14:56.678
- I couldn't live with myself
for having created it.

14:56.721 --> 15:01.596
A little girl was dead because
of me, because of my creation.

15:21.224 --> 15:23.226
- Which is why
we belong dead.

15:26.229 --> 15:27.927
Both of us.

15:27.970 --> 15:30.886
My companion and me.

16:30.032 --> 16:32.469
- Hey, Straw Dick!

16:32.513 --> 16:33.993
Eat crow!

17:41.364 --> 17:42.452
- Ah!

19:11.193 --> 19:12.803
- Hey, Billy.

19:12.847 --> 19:14.718
Wake up.

19:20.724 --> 19:22.552
You finally
come home for your beating?

19:25.686 --> 19:26.861
- Ugh!

19:32.693 --> 19:35.348
- Uh! What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

19:37.437 --> 19:40.962
- I'm just, uh--

19:41.005 --> 19:42.746
I'm just collecting
what I'm owed.

19:52.495 --> 19:55.933
- SCARECROW:

20:36.452 --> 20:37.888
- LYDIA: Look, I know
you two have been waiting

20:37.932 --> 20:39.542
anxiously for my decision.

20:39.586 --> 20:41.588
When the Metega IBO
closes tomorrow,

20:41.631 --> 20:43.459
Myan Capital Group is going
to become one of

20:43.503 --> 20:47.115
the richest private equity
groups in the country.

20:47.158 --> 20:49.944
And in the process, offering
you, Celia,

20:49.987 --> 20:53.600
or you, Tom,
the opportunity of a lifetime.

21:00.824 --> 21:02.565
- Did you feel that?
- LYDIA: Mm-hmm.

21:02.609 --> 21:04.350
Maybe a 3.2 on the Richter.

21:04.393 --> 21:07.048
Probably out somewhere
near Palmdale.

21:07.091 --> 21:10.181
Now, back to business.

21:10.225 --> 21:13.794
One of you is going to
be Midtech's new CFO.

21:25.849 --> 21:28.287
- Start practicing
your French, Tom.

21:31.420 --> 21:34.597
- Lydia, I--I don't
know what to say.

21:34.641 --> 21:35.859
I won't let you down.

21:35.903 --> 21:37.165
- LYDIA: I know you won't.

21:37.208 --> 21:39.602
You are one of the best
financial magicians

21:39.646 --> 21:41.038
that I've ever encountered.

21:41.082 --> 21:44.215
So I'm counting on you to
keep this new ship afloat.

21:44.259 --> 21:46.435
- I won't let you down.

21:46.479 --> 21:48.611
- I, uh--I need
to call my wife.

21:59.448 --> 22:01.189
- Seriously?

22:01.232 --> 22:03.365
Tom Harding?
- Cee.

22:03.409 --> 22:06.499
- Jesus, Lydia, you just
set us back 20 years.

22:06.542 --> 22:08.805
- He's being transferred
to Switzerland, Cee.

22:11.199 --> 22:13.810
- You were never gonna
let me be you, were you?

22:13.854 --> 22:16.117
- I thought you'd be relieved.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.292
Besides...

22:19.990 --> 22:21.383
I don't wanna lose you.

22:24.212 --> 22:26.432
- You were supposed
to have my back, Lydia.

22:28.651 --> 22:31.437
Isn't that what you preach
at all these conferences?

22:31.480 --> 22:35.005
How successful women owe
it to the rest of us?

22:35.049 --> 22:37.051
Bring us along, lift us up?

22:37.094 --> 22:38.922
Us against the brutes?

22:38.966 --> 22:42.012
- Oh, who cares about
a CFO position, Celia?

22:42.056 --> 22:44.928
- I...care.

22:44.972 --> 22:48.192
- When the IPO settles, there
is going to be so much money,

22:48.236 --> 22:50.238
we can do anything that we want.

22:50.281 --> 22:54.242
Travel the world
like we talked about.

22:54.285 --> 22:56.897
Maybe even let those morons
at the club

22:56.940 --> 22:58.551
talk me into running for office.

22:58.594 --> 22:59.987
Just imagine.

23:00.030 --> 23:03.033
The two of us
celebrated everywhere,

23:03.077 --> 23:06.689
smashing through barriers,
changing the world.

23:06.733 --> 23:08.387
- You don't get it, do you?

23:10.476 --> 23:13.000
That CFO position was going to
be the beginning of my life.

23:14.480 --> 23:16.351
The beginning of my rise.

23:16.395 --> 23:20.094
And I stupidly assumed that you
were going to help me get there.

23:20.137 --> 23:22.749
What a fucking idiot I was
to have believed in you.

23:22.792 --> 23:25.055
- Darling, there are going
to be other opportunities.

23:25.099 --> 23:26.796
- You're a fraud, Lydia.

23:28.363 --> 23:29.582
You know that?

23:29.625 --> 23:31.105
You're a first-class,
hypocritical fraud.

23:31.148 --> 23:32.280
- Look, I knew you were going

23:32.323 --> 23:34.761
to be disappointed--
- Disappointed? No.

23:36.153 --> 23:39.548
My eyes are open,
finally, thanks to you.

23:39.592 --> 23:42.595
All of this bullshit
about being

23:42.638 --> 23:44.335
a paragon
of women's empowerment,

23:44.379 --> 23:47.687
I mean, littering the floors
with the shards

23:47.730 --> 23:49.993
of glass ceilings that
you've shattered.

23:50.037 --> 23:53.649
Well-curated bullshit, my dear,
but bullshit all the same.

23:53.693 --> 23:56.086
- Maybe we should just
take a step back here.

23:56.130 --> 23:57.087
- You're afraid
of me, aren't you?

23:57.131 --> 23:58.915
- Afraid?

23:58.959 --> 24:00.351
- I'm younger, I'm smarter.

24:00.395 --> 24:02.702
I am a threat to you, aren't I?

24:02.745 --> 24:05.487
- I don't even recognize the
person that I'm talking to here.

24:06.749 --> 24:07.837
- Of course you don't.

24:09.448 --> 24:12.494
I am so far above you, you
couldn't find me in the clouds.

24:12.538 --> 24:15.541
Do you really think that
traveling the world,

24:15.584 --> 24:18.152
holding your hand
in Hong fucking Kong

24:18.195 --> 24:20.197
with a Stepford smile
on my face,

24:20.241 --> 24:21.547
everyone
kissing your ass?

24:21.590 --> 24:22.809
You really think
that's gonna cut it?

24:22.852 --> 24:24.158
- You just hang
on a minute here--

24:24.201 --> 24:26.116
- I didn't bust my ass
at Wharton for this.

24:26.160 --> 24:30.294
I deserved that promotion.

24:30.338 --> 24:33.297
And to hear that you
just want a sidekick,

24:33.341 --> 24:35.691
that is not my future.

24:35.735 --> 24:37.693
I am not an appendage
to the brilliant

24:37.737 --> 24:40.348
and powerful Lydia Lane.

24:40.391 --> 24:42.481
- Don't you think
I see who you are?

24:43.525 --> 24:46.354
Who you can become?

24:46.397 --> 24:49.009
- You have a funny
way of showing it.

24:49.052 --> 24:50.445
- I just want a life together.

24:51.707 --> 24:52.752
That's all.

24:52.795 --> 24:54.623
Me and you.

24:54.667 --> 24:56.886
-  That's
a fucking laugh.

24:56.930 --> 24:59.976
You think, after all of this,

25:00.020 --> 25:03.153
that I can ever
look you in the eye again?

25:03.197 --> 25:04.894
- Mm.

25:04.938 --> 25:07.070
- Damn, you are clueless.

25:07.114 --> 25:09.812
- Don't say something
that you don't mean...

25:09.856 --> 25:12.815
and that you can't take
back when you calm down.

25:16.166 --> 25:18.908
- Do you really think that all
those little spa trips

25:18.952 --> 25:20.649
out to the Greenbriar
and to Canyon Ranch

25:20.693 --> 25:23.870
can keep
the rust at bay, Lydia?

25:23.913 --> 25:26.786
- Please.

25:26.829 --> 25:29.789
- Christ, you fucking cow.

25:32.443 --> 25:35.403
Just wait until the world
hears how you lied to them,

25:35.446 --> 25:38.058
and how every woman on this
planet should just run

25:38.101 --> 25:39.407
the other direction as they
see you coming--

25:39.450 --> 25:40.669
- Stop!

25:48.808 --> 25:49.809
- Assault?

25:51.941 --> 25:54.465
Perfect.

think you're going?

26:10.046 --> 26:11.178
You're not going anywhere!

26:11.221 --> 26:12.745
Sit down!
- Let me go!

26:16.052 --> 26:18.664

27:35.915 --> 27:37.873
Everything okay?

27:37.917 --> 27:41.355
- Yeah, Celia's just a little
upset about losing to Tom.

27:41.398 --> 27:44.575
I'm trying to get
her to go home.

27:44.619 --> 27:47.100
You know, have the valet bring
her Tesla around

29:07.833 --> 29:09.138
- It hit her kinda hard.

29:10.531 --> 29:11.575
- Well, she's a tough one.

29:11.619 --> 29:13.142
She'll bounce back.

29:13.186 --> 29:14.709

33:36.014 --> 33:37.058
weren't a waste after all.
