00:05.639 --> 00:09.480
Daniel Reed. Why are you looking<br>for me? We only wish to speak
with you. It's about your father.

00:09.480 --> 00:10.800
I came here to find answers.

00:10.800 --> 00:12.679
I found out my dad<br>was transferring money -

00:12.679 --> 00:14.000
to a man called Mirza Barzani.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.280
And when I found out why,<br>it made me sick.

00:16.280 --> 00:17.359
To my guts.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.640
I want to sleep in the shed.

00:20.640 --> 00:23.000
And I need you to lock me in.

00:28.239 --> 00:31.160
Hey, that's it, all right?<br>On your way. Get out!

00:32.240 --> 00:36.280
I see how you look at Alice.<br>You know she's different, don't you?

00:36.280 --> 00:41.000
I have a brain tumour.<br>You are looking at a dying man.

00:51.359 --> 00:53.039
I found something.

00:53.039 --> 00:54.399
That's Alice.

00:54.399 --> 00:57.119
No. Look at the girl<br>sitting next to her.

00:57.119 --> 00:59.719
That's my daughter.<br>That's Alice.

00:59.719 --> 01:00.920
No!

01:00.920 --> 01:02.719
Sam!

01:02.719 --> 01:04.358
Alice!

01:04.358 --> 01:05.400
SAM!

01:08.079 --> 01:09.359
Alice!

02:17.879 --> 02:19.280
Nadia?

02:20.560 --> 02:22.680
Ich wollte sehen,<br>wie's ihnen geht.

02:25.560 --> 02:26.599
Hallo?

02:42.639 --> 02:43.680
Ja?

02:46.960 --> 02:48.879
Ja, naturlich, ich bin unterwegs.

03:12.280 --> 03:15.199
'Hello?' Sergeant,<br>apologies for the early hour,

03:15.199 --> 03:16.360
I am in Paris and I...

03:16.360 --> 03:19.120
'This isn't a good time, Baptiste.<br>Alice is dead.'

03:20.240 --> 03:21.639
When?

03:21.639 --> 03:23.439
'Last night. She burned to death.

03:23.439 --> 03:26.439
'We found petrol canisters<br>inside the shed where she slept.'

03:26.439 --> 03:29.400
She used them to start the fire.<br>She killed herself.

03:30.400 --> 03:32.360
I'm truly sorry to hear this.

03:32.360 --> 03:34.759
What was it you said to her<br>yesterday?

03:34.759 --> 03:37.199
I asked her some questions,<br>that is all.

03:37.199 --> 03:39.159
'Mr Webster said you started<br>interrogating her,

03:39.159 --> 03:41.400
'asking questions in French.'

03:41.400 --> 03:43.360
And then right after you upset her,

03:43.360 --> 03:46.840
she climbed out the window<br>and went missing for three hours.

03:46.840 --> 03:49.400
Only to return<br>and take her own life.

03:50.800 --> 03:52.639
'But this doesn't make any sense.'

03:52.639 --> 03:55.439
She was gone for three hours.<br>Where did she go?

03:56.719 --> 03:59.120
We don't know. She didn't say.

03:59.120 --> 04:01.800
Coming to terms with what<br>she was about to do, maybe.

04:02.919 --> 04:04.639
'So, you said you were in Paris.'

04:04.639 --> 04:06.599
Not for long. I will be back today.

04:47.040 --> 04:49.920
# Oh, my love

04:49.920 --> 04:53.560
# We pray each day

04:53.560 --> 04:57.319
# May you come home

04:57.319 --> 05:01.120
# And be OK

05:08.160 --> 05:13.079
# For now we wait for you

05:13.079 --> 05:18.000
♪ For you to come home. ♪

05:34.240 --> 05:35.920
You should've stayed away.

05:35.920 --> 05:37.959
You're not part<br>of this investigation.

05:37.959 --> 05:41.279
And before you ask,<br>we're running DNA to confirm the ID,

05:41.279 --> 05:43.360
a familial match<br>against the parents.

05:43.360 --> 05:46.360
There's nothing more to be done<br>here. By either of us.

05:46.360 --> 05:49.519
Sophie may still be out there,<br>she may still be alive.

05:49.519 --> 05:51.079
Kristian Herz isn't talking.

05:51.079 --> 05:53.759
And from what Alice said -<br>Sophie didn't have a chance.

05:53.759 --> 05:56.800
That is only if we believe<br>everything Alice Webster told us.

05:59.079 --> 06:02.079
We'll never get the chance<br>to question her, will we?

06:02.079 --> 06:05.319
Not after you went there, and<br>started throwing accusations at her.

06:05.319 --> 06:07.399
The time for blame will come,<br>Sergeant.

06:07.399 --> 06:10.040
For now,<br>all that matters is the truth.

06:10.040 --> 06:11.879
Why did the girl take her own life?

06:11.879 --> 06:15.800
Where did she go for three hours?<br>If we can understand this...

06:15.800 --> 06:18.120
How can we ever understand<br>what Alice went through?

06:18.120 --> 06:19.759
What that does to a person?

06:19.759 --> 06:22.160
There is more at play<br>in this case than we know.

06:22.160 --> 06:25.199
If I was just allowed to speak<br>with Kristian Herz, please.

06:25.199 --> 06:26.519
He's in custody.

06:26.519 --> 06:29.360
We'll keep pushing him<br>to tell us where Sophie is,

06:29.360 --> 06:30.839
but we don't need your help.

06:30.839 --> 06:32.240
Go home.

06:34.360 --> 06:35.639
Sir, this way, please.

06:48.279 --> 06:50.519
Matthew! Where have you been?<br>I've been calling.

06:50.519 --> 06:52.079
I was there till the fire went out.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.120
Then...

06:54.120 --> 06:55.879
I don't know, I was just...

06:58.439 --> 06:59.800
She's gone.

07:14.240 --> 07:15.399
How's Dad?

07:17.959 --> 07:20.959
The doctors said the burns<br>are worst on his back.

07:20.959 --> 07:23.319
They cleaned him up in<br>the emergency room,

07:23.319 --> 07:25.920
and now he's on painkillers<br>and antibiotics.

07:25.920 --> 07:27.759
He's going to be all right.

07:27.759 --> 07:32.319
I'm sorry. She asked me.<br>She begged me. I didn't know...

07:33.319 --> 07:35.920
I don't know how it happened.<br>I never meant...

07:41.959 --> 07:43.279
What's that?

07:45.279 --> 07:46.759
What did you say, love?

07:50.800 --> 07:51.839
Get out.

07:58.879 --> 08:01.720
No, Matthew... Matthew!

08:16.399 --> 08:20.120
She had brown hair,<br>an English girl, 21 or so.

08:20.120 --> 08:23.279
She would be here buying<br>petrol in a canister.

08:23.279 --> 08:25.879
Yes. Yes, I see this woman.<br>She wears a...

08:25.879 --> 08:28.560
A hat. Like a baseball cap?

08:28.560 --> 08:29.959
Did you see where she came from?

08:29.959 --> 08:32.360
Through those trees. No car.

08:32.360 --> 08:35.279
But...this is what I tell<br>your colleague just now.

08:47.759 --> 08:49.600
What is it they say? Great minds?

08:49.600 --> 08:51.720
Perhaps - once upon a time.

08:51.720 --> 08:53.919
Do not be so modest. I googled you.

08:53.919 --> 08:55.679
No-one is safe any more.

08:55.679 --> 08:58.879
Well, I am glad someone else feels<br>it is worthwhile tracking

08:58.879 --> 09:00.919
Alice Webster's movements yesterday.

09:00.919 --> 09:03.360
Three hours to be gone<br>is a long time.

09:03.360 --> 09:06.559
The Bundespolizei were all over<br>Eckhausen looking for her.

09:06.559 --> 09:09.039
Which suggests she did not<br>want to be found.

09:09.039 --> 09:13.480
The girl was hiding something.<br>This was her last stop before home.

09:13.480 --> 09:14.799
So the question is...

09:14.799 --> 09:17.639
What she did in the two hours before<br>she came to the petrol station.

09:17.639 --> 09:19.039
May I?

09:21.600 --> 09:26.080
So. The average walking speed<br>is 2.8mph.

09:26.080 --> 09:30.559
She went through that field.<br>That way lies Eckhausen.

09:30.559 --> 09:33.639
So...there is the search zone.

09:33.639 --> 09:36.440
Are there any cameras in Eckhausen?

09:36.440 --> 09:39.080
CCTV, security, traffic?

09:39.080 --> 09:42.279
Well, not as many as in Paris,<br>but, yes. We have some.

09:42.279 --> 09:43.840
We start there.

09:43.840 --> 09:45.879
We? Together?

09:45.879 --> 09:48.399
If everyone helps<br>to hold up the sky,

09:48.399 --> 09:50.399
then one person doesn't get tired.

09:53.679 --> 09:55.720
And you say you are not<br>a great mind.

09:57.360 --> 10:00.679
Sadly I cannot take credit for that.

10:00.679 --> 10:02.720
Do you know who said it?

10:02.720 --> 10:04.200
Who?

10:04.200 --> 10:05.600
Google it.

10:26.159 --> 10:27.279
Mr Herz.

10:29.879 --> 10:31.080
It's funny.

10:32.679 --> 10:35.159
There isn't<br>a speck of dust on this floor.

10:38.320 --> 10:41.879
They clean my cell more<br>than I clean my own house.

10:41.879 --> 10:44.279
It's not the place that's filthy.

10:47.360 --> 10:49.399
Why are you here?

10:49.399 --> 10:53.120
Your wife...<br>she was attacked last night.

10:55.919 --> 10:58.840
She... Is she...?

10:58.840 --> 11:00.200
She's in a coma.

11:03.360 --> 11:04.639
Can I see her?

11:04.639 --> 11:07.240
Not unless you tell us<br>where Sophie Giroux is.

11:10.240 --> 11:13.720
But...how can I?<br>I don't know anything.

11:20.559 --> 11:24.000
It's funny, you almost<br>make yourself seem human.

11:27.960 --> 11:30.919
Maybe if you confessed, someone<br>wouldn't have gone after her.

11:30.919 --> 11:33.519
Maybe she'd still have her teeth.

11:51.120 --> 11:54.600
Christ. How many photos<br>did you go through?

11:54.600 --> 11:57.519
There must have been thousands.

11:57.519 --> 12:00.840
This girl's face is a blur...<br>her hair's all over the place.

12:00.840 --> 12:02.279
It's my daughter.

12:02.279 --> 12:04.039
The picture's really not that clear.

12:04.039 --> 12:05.960
I want to go there. To the park.

12:05.960 --> 12:08.480
Maybe somebody saw the two of them<br>together. Maybe somebody...

12:08.480 --> 12:12.320
Are you saying that the girl<br>who came back - the girl you took

12:12.320 --> 12:15.879
into your house - are you saying<br>that wasn't your daughter?

12:15.879 --> 12:18.399
We wanted to believe it. OK?

12:18.399 --> 12:23.159
We wanted to believe it so badly<br>that we just...shut our eyes.

12:23.159 --> 12:24.200
Mrs Webster...

12:24.200 --> 12:27.039
But a part of me knew.<br>The way she talked.

12:28.320 --> 12:29.600
The look in her eye.

12:33.120 --> 12:36.799
He could see it.<br>That detective, Baptiste.

12:36.799 --> 12:40.960
Even if it was true -<br>how does it help us now?

12:40.960 --> 12:43.519
I don't know.<br>But it must mean something.

12:45.279 --> 12:49.600
I'd go myself,<br>but no-one's going to listen to me.

12:49.600 --> 12:52.360
I have no authority<br>outside the Army.

12:52.360 --> 12:55.559
But you know what to look for.<br>You know who to ask.

12:57.919 --> 13:01.639
My dad's nurse quit.<br>I've got no-one to look after him.

13:03.480 --> 13:04.879
I'm sorry.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.720
The garrison's only up the road,

13:16.720 --> 13:20.639
I suppose I could get<br>someone to...come by.

13:22.919 --> 13:24.240
Thank you.

13:29.639 --> 13:31.720
So, will your husband be joining us?

13:34.600 --> 13:38.360
No. I didn't tell Sam.<br>We don't talk about Alice.

13:40.919 --> 13:43.919
We don't talk about anything<br>much these days.

13:43.919 --> 13:46.919
'O'Sullivan.'<br>Hi, it's Eve Stone.

13:46.919 --> 13:49.600
'How can I help?'<br>Yeah, I need a favour...

14:04.559 --> 14:08.039
Julien! We've got to keep moving.<br>We need to go.

14:08.039 --> 14:10.399
Out into the crossfire?

14:11.919 --> 14:14.960
The Peshmerga has started<br>to fall back. We should go.

14:16.919 --> 14:23.080
The question is to risk our<br>lives on...on fate or chance.

14:27.639 --> 14:32.799
It's hard not to think of those<br>girls, kept in that basement.

14:32.799 --> 14:34.960
Scared of the world outside.

14:37.759 --> 14:40.480
Somebody builds a wall<br>around you, and...

14:42.879 --> 14:45.159
..soon you start<br>to build your own.

14:54.639 --> 14:56.080
We have to go. Come on!

15:18.639 --> 15:21.759
You two, over here.<br>This way, move! Go! Go!

15:40.080 --> 15:43.639
Staff Sergeant Eve Stone, of the<br>Military Police out of Eckhausen.

15:43.639 --> 15:46.159
We called ahead.<br>We're meeting Dieter Ackermann?

15:49.480 --> 15:51.600
Ich habe hier zwei frauen fur Sie.

15:54.639 --> 15:57.440
OK. He's just coming.

15:57.440 --> 15:58.879
Thank you.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.639
Sergeant Stone?

16:17.639 --> 16:19.360
Hello.

16:19.360 --> 16:20.960
So sorry, excuse me.

16:23.799 --> 16:25.360
Stone?

16:25.360 --> 16:28.519
'It's O'Sullivan. Look, I know I<br>said I'd look in on your father,

16:28.519 --> 16:30.320
'but I've been called<br>to a disturbance.'

16:32.080 --> 16:34.679
I understand. Don't worry about it.

16:53.519 --> 16:54.759
Hey.

16:54.759 --> 16:56.000
'Sam.'

16:56.000 --> 16:57.879
We still meeting later?

16:57.879 --> 17:00.120
'It's not about that. It's my dad.'

17:00.120 --> 17:04.640
I need you to...go round to my house<br>and keep an eye on him.

17:04.640 --> 17:06.759
I thought that wasn't what this is.

17:08.118 --> 17:11.358
'His nurse quit.<br>He can't look after himself.'

17:11.358 --> 17:13.680
Why can't you do it?<br>I'm working on the car.

17:14.799 --> 17:15.960
I just can't.

17:17.720 --> 17:18.720
OK?

17:20.319 --> 17:21.358
Please.

17:23.880 --> 17:25.880
Yeah, all right. I'll go round now.

17:25.880 --> 17:26.920
Thank you.

17:35.440 --> 17:38.319
I'm sorry. The rollercoaster<br>is the only ride we do with...

17:38.319 --> 17:40.000
photographs. You understand?

17:40.000 --> 17:43.279
What about CCTV? Security cameras?

17:43.279 --> 17:45.200
We have dummies,<br>but they do not film.

17:45.200 --> 17:46.640
We are small, privately run...

17:46.640 --> 17:48.039
There must be something.

17:48.039 --> 17:50.440
I'm sorry. I do not...

17:50.440 --> 17:51.559
Thank you, anyway.

17:53.519 --> 17:55.759
We should go. My dad's...

17:55.759 --> 18:00.400
Well...maybe if we ask around?<br>Maybe somebody saw something.

18:00.400 --> 18:02.480
Isn't it worth trying? Just in case?

18:05.400 --> 18:07.680
Sure. OK. Let's ask.

18:08.960 --> 18:10.160
Thank you.

18:12.359 --> 18:13.759
TV ON

18:43.480 --> 18:44.759
Hello.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.400
Hi.

19:14.240 --> 19:15.559
We need to keep moving.

19:15.559 --> 19:18.240
OK. Let's go. Go go go go!

19:33.839 --> 19:35.119
Come on. Julien...

19:37.200 --> 19:39.480
No, no, no.<br>Julien, it's the Peshmerga.

19:47.200 --> 19:52.000
Come away. Julien, that's fine.<br>The Peshmerga. The Peshmerga, OK?

20:50.279 --> 20:52.160
To the airport, yes?

20:52.160 --> 20:54.200
Yeah. Going somewhere nice?

20:54.200 --> 20:55.599
Going somewhere else.

21:24.480 --> 21:25.920
How are you feeling?

21:29.960 --> 21:33.039
If she hadn't walked out of that<br>basement she might be alive today.

21:36.079 --> 21:38.079
And what kind of life would that be?

21:52.319 --> 21:53.799
They're saying she did it.

21:56.119 --> 21:58.759
She took the petrol in there.<br>They found a canister.

22:01.640 --> 22:04.359
She killed herself.<br>She was locked in!

22:04.359 --> 22:06.400
Even if she had second thoughts,<br>maybe...

22:06.400 --> 22:09.359
We can't think like that, it's...<br>I can think the way I want.
..poisonous.

22:11.640 --> 22:15.240
How could he do that?<br>How could he lock her in there?
After all she'd been through.

22:15.240 --> 22:17.279
Sam, it is not Matthew's fault...

22:17.279 --> 22:18.440
He knows what he did.

22:21.599 --> 22:22.880
You both do.

22:24.400 --> 22:25.599
What do you mean?

22:25.599 --> 22:28.200
She came home, she needed support.<br>She needed her family.

22:28.200 --> 22:30.839
She was so different...<br>You called her a liar!

22:32.400 --> 22:33.799
That is not what I said.

22:33.799 --> 22:37.319
She heard what you said, Gemma,<br>and that's why she did it.

22:37.319 --> 22:39.119
That's why she killed herself.

22:53.039 --> 22:54.799
Do you remember, when she was born,

22:54.799 --> 22:57.039
how long it took her<br>to get off to sleep?

22:57.039 --> 23:01.680
No. Cos you weren't there.<br>It was me.

23:01.680 --> 23:05.160
It was me, holding her.<br>Night after night, singing to her.

23:05.160 --> 23:08.200
Holding on to her little hand.

23:08.200 --> 23:10.160
I know my daughter!

23:10.160 --> 23:13.000
And that girl, that girl<br>that came back?

23:13.000 --> 23:16.279
That was not her...<br>that was not my Alice!

23:16.279 --> 23:18.319
NO! Don't you DARE!

23:18.319 --> 23:21.720
Don't you DARE say that to me now!

23:21.720 --> 23:23.640
Don't you dare say that to me...

23:38.799 --> 23:42.319
Hey. Thanks for meeting me.<br>I got you one of these.

23:42.319 --> 23:44.279
No caffeine.

23:44.279 --> 23:46.759
Of course.<br>Remind me never to get pregnant.

23:49.680 --> 23:54.039
I got a call from a journalist<br>asking about Alice Webster.

23:55.480 --> 23:57.319
Jesus.

23:57.319 --> 24:01.599
It's out there now. It's going to<br>be a global news piece.

24:01.599 --> 24:04.759
The press are onto Nadia Herz's<br>assault. They're joining the dots.

24:04.759 --> 24:07.039
Asking if Matthew Webster<br>could have been involved.

24:07.039 --> 24:10.079
I said no comment, but...

24:10.079 --> 24:12.440
If they're not given a story,<br>they make one up.

24:12.440 --> 24:13.559
I know.

24:14.960 --> 24:17.279
So...what do you want me to do?

24:17.279 --> 24:20.039
Talk to the families.<br>Get drafting a statement.

24:22.759 --> 24:24.000
Yeah...right, right.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.839
I know, it's the last thing<br>they need right now.

24:25.839 --> 24:28.359
But I'd rather they control<br>the story here.

24:28.359 --> 24:30.920
In the meantime,<br>I'll speak to Matthew Webster.

24:30.920 --> 24:34.640
Of course. I don't want them<br>getting sandbagged by questions.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.640
Not after what's happened to them.

24:53.839 --> 24:55.319
Mrs Webster?

24:57.119 --> 24:59.680
Adam Gettrick from<br>the Army Press Office.

25:03.440 --> 25:04.880
They know, don't they?

25:06.960 --> 25:08.200
About Alice?

25:10.319 --> 25:11.680
Not for sure.

25:15.160 --> 25:17.680
But they know something's going on.

25:18.960 --> 25:22.720
I don't know how -<br>someone in the hospital,

25:22.720 --> 25:26.920
or...one of the German police<br>speaking out of turn...

25:30.720 --> 25:33.839
Everyone stops to watch<br>the car crash, don't they?

25:35.519 --> 25:37.240
See the blood on the road.

25:39.480 --> 25:42.119
We should think about<br>making a statement.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.359
I can draft something.

25:46.359 --> 25:47.799
If that would help.

25:50.839 --> 25:52.480
I don't want to talk about it.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.839
Mrs Webster...

26:01.480 --> 26:04.480
..if we don't make a statement...

26:04.480 --> 26:06.119
they won't leave you alone.

26:06.119 --> 26:08.359
I said I don't want<br>to talk about her.

26:37.400 --> 26:39.839
I thought with this kind of<br>time-frame it wouldn't take

26:39.839 --> 26:41.799
so long to find something.

26:41.799 --> 26:45.359
It depends if there<br>is anything to find.

26:53.759 --> 26:55.839
It's like waiting<br>for Hilde to talk.

27:00.079 --> 27:01.519
What?

27:05.039 --> 27:08.519
When I was a child,<br>my mother bought me a parrot.

27:08.519 --> 27:10.200
Hilde, it was called.

27:11.720 --> 27:15.039
Every day, I come home from school,<br>waiting for this bird to say a word.

27:16.400 --> 27:18.599
And every day...nothing.

27:20.359 --> 27:23.359
So, waiting for Hilde to talk,<br>we used to say.

27:25.279 --> 27:26.519
And did she ever talk?

27:27.759 --> 27:28.799
Not a word.

27:31.920 --> 27:35.880
When I first began this job,<br>I thought it would all be exciting.

27:35.880 --> 27:37.599
I soon realised what it was -

27:37.599 --> 27:40.240
sifting through the earth,<br>grain by grain.

27:48.279 --> 27:50.680
But the devil is in the detail,

27:50.680 --> 27:52.519
and...

27:52.519 --> 27:53.599
What?

27:57.759 --> 28:00.519
Sometimes Hilde talks.

28:00.519 --> 28:01.599
Go back, please.

28:03.960 --> 28:06.279
There. There she is.

28:06.279 --> 28:07.440
Go forward.

28:13.799 --> 28:15.160
There are no other cameras?

28:15.160 --> 28:17.960
With a view that leads on from here?

28:17.960 --> 28:19.640
Can you play it slowly?

28:27.240 --> 28:28.839
Where was she going?

28:35.480 --> 28:37.000
You should not be here.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.839
It was your units.<br>Your men brought us here.

28:39.839 --> 28:43.119
Rat-a-tat-a-tat. You get shot.<br>Understand?

28:43.119 --> 28:44.400
Yes.

28:44.400 --> 28:46.359
ISIL, they will come back.

28:46.359 --> 28:48.960
They come back...<br>and you get shot.

28:48.960 --> 28:50.119
I understand.

28:50.119 --> 28:53.039
We get it.<br>You too. Rat-a-tat-a-tat.

28:57.480 --> 28:59.680
We just wish to return to Erbil.

29:01.640 --> 29:05.200
OK. We will arrange. Let's go.

29:05.200 --> 29:08.720
Come on, follow me. Let's go.

29:21.799 --> 29:22.920
Was it worth it?

29:24.839 --> 29:26.119
Excuse me?

29:26.119 --> 29:29.359
Coming all this way.<br>Nearly getting killed.

29:29.359 --> 29:32.160
I told myself I wouldn't rest until<br>I find the man who took

29:32.160 --> 29:34.079
Sophie Giroux and Alice Webster.

29:36.400 --> 29:38.799
Well, I'm sorry that all this<br>was for nothing.

29:40.160 --> 29:41.200
Perhaps.

29:43.039 --> 29:45.480
Daniel said his father<br>was sending money

29:45.480 --> 29:47.200
to a man called Mirza Barzani.

29:48.680 --> 29:51.240
I think we should find out why.

29:51.240 --> 29:53.319
'Hello, Detective Lenhart.'

29:53.319 --> 29:55.640
Jorn, it's Baptiste.

29:55.640 --> 29:58.880
'Julien.' I need your help<br>finding someone.

30:09.079 --> 30:12.200
How are you doing, sir?<br>Can I get you anything?

30:16.200 --> 30:20.319
Captain Webster.<br>Honourable Tank Regiment.

30:22.200 --> 30:23.839
Yes, sir. That's me.

30:23.839 --> 30:28.200
Your boys came under fire in 2010.<br>Basra.

30:28.200 --> 30:30.880
Yes, sir. I was on patrol.

30:32.720 --> 30:33.759
Three souls.

30:37.160 --> 30:40.160
I'm sorry about what<br>happened to your daughter.

30:51.359 --> 30:52.759
Thank you.

30:55.960 --> 31:00.400
She was very young...I remember.

31:01.519 --> 31:03.160
Taken outside the school.

31:05.400 --> 31:08.839
She was... She liked spiders.

31:09.839 --> 31:12.200
An alternative sort.

31:12.200 --> 31:14.519
She was called...

31:14.519 --> 31:15.559
She was...

31:17.920 --> 31:20.039
Alice.

31:20.039 --> 31:22.240
Alice Webster. Yes.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.920
I wouldn't forget that, Captain.

31:30.799 --> 31:33.880
I wonder if they'll ever find out<br>what happened to her.

31:42.400 --> 31:43.920
She died, sir.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.200
Took her own life.

32:04.880 --> 32:08.119
What makes you think you're fit<br>to join the military, then, son?

33:04.839 --> 33:07.480
You've never seen either of<br>these girls? No.

33:07.480 --> 33:08.920
Are you sure?

33:08.920 --> 33:10.359
Sorry.

33:10.359 --> 33:12.039
Thank you.

33:12.039 --> 33:14.160
So you haven't seen<br>either of these girls?

33:14.160 --> 33:17.240
They might have been with<br>an older man? No, I'm sorry.

33:24.200 --> 33:26.200
No, I'm sorry. None of them?<br>No, I'm sorry.

33:32.759 --> 33:35.119
Nothing?<br>Sorry.

33:42.240 --> 33:44.880
I know you think this whole<br>thing is pointless.

33:44.880 --> 33:46.160
I didn't say that.

33:49.279 --> 33:50.839
You didn't have to.

33:51.920 --> 33:55.880
But the thing is you do anything<br>for your kids, absolutely anything.

34:05.759 --> 34:10.039
Have you ever thought about having<br>kids? A family of your own?

34:13.079 --> 34:16.119
It just...never happened.<br>Always moving around.

34:17.480 --> 34:19.119
Maybe one day.

34:19.119 --> 34:21.840
Not... God knows when.

34:28.320 --> 34:29.360
Well.

34:31.159 --> 34:33.280
We all find a way to survive,<br>don't we?

34:43.800 --> 34:45.800
It's all right. All right, stand up.

34:48.360 --> 34:49.480
There you go.

34:51.440 --> 34:54.119
I'm sorry, I...<br>It's fine.

34:56.079 --> 34:57.480
I'll be back in a minute.

35:22.119 --> 35:23.519
I don't know what happened.

35:23.519 --> 35:26.159
It's fine, honestly,<br>don't think about it. Really.

35:28.599 --> 35:29.840
You're a good lad.

35:33.360 --> 35:34.639
No, I'm not.

35:37.199 --> 35:39.679
Let's find you something<br>to wear, shall we?

36:11.400 --> 36:13.519
She always wanted a family.

36:15.400 --> 36:18.039
It hit her hard, you know?

36:42.039 --> 36:45.000
Park's closing up.<br>We should be heading off.

36:50.800 --> 36:52.599
He's been happier recently,<br>you know.

36:53.639 --> 36:56.519
What?<br>Sam.

36:56.519 --> 36:58.639
He's been happier.

36:58.639 --> 36:59.679
Lately.

37:02.079 --> 37:03.440
Right?

37:05.360 --> 37:06.760
I don't...

37:09.440 --> 37:11.159
Come on.

37:24.760 --> 37:25.800
I'm sorry.

37:27.519 --> 37:30.159
You know, when Alice was taken...

37:30.159 --> 37:32.199
we fell apart at the seams.

37:33.280 --> 37:35.480
All three of us. Together.

37:37.360 --> 37:39.440
But it did make us stronger.

37:41.760 --> 37:47.159
It did, because what we lost in<br>Alice we still had in each other.

37:49.239 --> 37:53.480
We had that love that you only<br>keep for your family.

37:55.719 --> 37:57.960
And when she walked<br>back into our lives...

37:59.920 --> 38:01.760
..we fell apart all over again.

38:07.920 --> 38:08.960
It just...

38:11.159 --> 38:14.000
..happened.<br>This isn't about you. Is it?

38:23.280 --> 38:25.159
Don't tell Sam I know, will you?

38:36.840 --> 38:39.280
He still loves you.<br>Oh, right!

38:39.280 --> 38:42.000
Fine. Really.

38:43.920 --> 38:45.559
Well, even if that's true...

38:47.199 --> 38:48.800
..what does it bloody matter?

39:00.840 --> 39:02.079
Julien?

39:04.159 --> 39:05.320
Julien.

39:06.920 --> 39:08.280
Julien, are you OK?

39:11.360 --> 39:13.239
Sometimes I get headaches.

39:14.599 --> 39:17.760
Your friend found<br>Mirza Barzani fast.

39:19.000 --> 39:20.480
We should be there soon.

39:30.679 --> 39:31.800
'Julien?'

40:09.039 --> 40:11.280
I wonder if you can help us.

40:11.280 --> 40:13.840
We're trying to find this girl.

40:13.840 --> 40:17.519
She might have passed here yesterday<br>between four and six o'clock.

40:17.519 --> 40:19.599
Oh, yeah, I remember her.<br>She came in here.

40:19.599 --> 40:22.159
She did? What did she want?

40:22.159 --> 40:23.800
Statice flowers. 12 of them.

40:23.800 --> 40:29.199
Purple. And then she asked me<br>the way to the graveyard,

40:29.199 --> 40:30.599
of course.

40:30.599 --> 40:31.639
Why "of course"?

40:32.719 --> 40:34.960
These are flowers for remembrance.

40:34.960 --> 40:38.280
Usually we put these<br>on a grave, you see, so...

40:41.719 --> 40:43.880
She seemed so sad, this girl.

41:32.360 --> 41:33.599
Matthew?

41:36.519 --> 41:37.880
Do you mind if I sit down?

41:48.639 --> 41:53.559
Matthew, Kristian Herz' wife,<br>Nadia, was found

41:53.559 --> 41:55.599
beaten half to death last night.

41:55.599 --> 41:58.400
She's in the ICU<br>in a coma right now.

41:59.519 --> 42:01.440
OK.

42:01.440 --> 42:03.400
It's unlikely to be a coincidence

42:03.400 --> 42:06.199
that the wife of the man<br>who abducted your sister

42:06.199 --> 42:08.719
be brutally beaten<br>the day of his arrest.

42:10.719 --> 42:13.800
You think... You think it was me?

42:13.800 --> 42:15.719
I didn't say that.

42:15.719 --> 42:18.320
But I'd like to know<br>where you were last night.

42:20.320 --> 42:23.280
That man - Kristian -<br>he's the one that took Alice.

42:23.280 --> 42:25.719
Why would I attack his wife?<br>That doesn't make any sense.

42:25.719 --> 42:28.679
I'm not accusing you, Matthew.<br>I'm on your side.

42:28.679 --> 42:30.960
But if you know something...<br>How can you come here,

42:30.960 --> 42:33.000
while my sister's just...<br>Matthew, just calm down.

42:33.000 --> 42:36.559
She's gone! I haven't done anything<br>wrong. She done it to herself.

42:36.559 --> 42:38.119
Why can't you just leave us alone!

42:41.519 --> 42:44.960
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.

42:44.960 --> 42:48.039
I didn't mean to hurt you, honestly,<br>I was just trying to get past.

42:48.039 --> 42:49.079
I'm fine.

42:49.079 --> 42:53.000
Sergeant Stone, I am so, so sorry.<br>I'll find a doctor.

42:53.000 --> 42:54.960
It's OK.

42:59.559 --> 43:00.960
Hello?

43:03.960 --> 43:06.159
All right,<br>thanks for letting me know.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.320
Where's your mum?

43:17.800 --> 43:19.039
Mrs Webster?

43:22.039 --> 43:25.719
The DNA results are back<br>on the remains in your shed.

43:25.719 --> 43:27.760
We ran them against your husband.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.559
It's a confirmed match<br>with your daughter.

43:37.119 --> 43:38.519
It's...

43:40.440 --> 43:41.960
It's really Alice?

43:45.239 --> 43:48.559
It's really my Alice, you're sure?

43:50.239 --> 43:52.400
I'm sorry, but yes.

43:54.159 --> 43:55.960
I just... I thought you should know.

45:28.119 --> 45:29.639
Are you sure you're ready?

45:39.400 --> 45:42.840
Mrs Webster, Mrs Webster,<br>where is Alice now?

45:42.840 --> 45:45.239
Mrs Webster...

45:48.280 --> 45:50.360
Mrs Webster will make<br>a short statement.

45:50.360 --> 45:51.960
There will be no questions.

45:55.320 --> 46:00.559
My daughter, Alice Webster,<br>was abducted in 2003.

46:03.039 --> 46:07.440
And four days ago,<br>she came back to us.

46:12.440 --> 46:16.360
I know there'll be a lot written<br>about this - what happened to

46:16.360 --> 46:19.400
my daughter is one of those things,<br>one of those...

46:19.400 --> 46:24.119
horrible things that you read about<br>in the newspaper and you say,

46:24.119 --> 46:25.800
"That's awful."

46:26.960 --> 46:31.159
But really you're thinking...<br>"I'm glad it's not me."

46:34.760 --> 46:37.840
And no matter what gets written...

46:37.840 --> 46:39.000
you'll never understand...

46:41.360 --> 46:43.639
..what it's like to resign yourself

46:43.639 --> 46:46.480
to never seeing someone<br>you love ever again.

46:51.239 --> 46:52.760
And when they come back...

46:55.199 --> 46:56.639
..you can't believe it.

47:00.480 --> 47:01.920
I couldn't.

47:04.039 --> 47:05.199
It was her, and...

47:07.559 --> 47:10.119
..I just couldn't believe it.

47:17.599 --> 47:23.239
My daughter...wasn't just....

47:23.239 --> 47:25.400
a name for your headlines.

47:28.119 --> 47:29.400
She was a girl.

47:32.320 --> 47:33.920
She was our girl.

47:36.719 --> 47:39.000
And we loved her.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.559
Mrs Webster... Mrs Webster,<br>do you know who found her?

47:41.559 --> 47:43.440
As I said, no questions.

47:55.119 --> 47:56.360
Julien?

47:59.880 --> 48:01.000
Julien?

48:04.559 --> 48:05.639
Julien?

48:07.000 --> 48:08.840
Did you not hear me shout?

48:08.840 --> 48:12.000
I was miles away, forgive me.<br>These places, well...

48:13.920 --> 48:17.360
Some find them to be peaceful.<br>Myself, I find it hard.

48:17.360 --> 48:21.400
All these lives, laid bare -<br>everything they stood for

48:21.400 --> 48:23.679
reduced to a few words<br>on a tombstone.

48:23.679 --> 48:25.280
A novel abridged to a haiku.

48:28.840 --> 48:30.719
I think I have found the flowers.

48:32.960 --> 48:34.840
They look fresh, too,<br>unlike the others.

48:34.840 --> 48:36.599
They could have been bought<br>yesterday.

48:37.760 --> 48:42.000
So she runs from her family,<br>disappears without a word.

48:42.000 --> 48:45.519
And while the entire police<br>department searches for her,

48:45.519 --> 48:49.880
she finds the time to buy flowers<br>and visit a grave

48:49.880 --> 48:52.480
before going home to do<br>what she did.

48:56.519 --> 48:58.639
Who is this man?

48:58.639 --> 48:59.679
Henry Reed.

49:00.679 --> 49:04.280
And why did she need to see him<br>before she took her own life?

49:48.199 --> 49:49.639
Mirza Barzani?

49:57.199 --> 49:59.239
Do you speak English?

49:59.239 --> 50:02.320
Bristol University. Three years.

50:02.320 --> 50:04.519
Our exhibits are displayed<br>in chronological order,

50:04.519 --> 50:07.639
starting with the Palaeolithic age,<br>down there...

50:07.639 --> 50:11.159
moving into the ancient<br>civilisations of Mesopotamia

50:11.159 --> 50:14.559
and ending on the right side in<br>the period of Abbasid.

50:14.559 --> 50:16.599
Although, I can see from your faces

50:16.599 --> 50:19.960
you do not seem interested<br>in what the past has to offer...

50:19.960 --> 50:23.400
Far from it. The past is exactly<br>the reason we are here.

50:23.400 --> 50:25.199
Only not this far back.

50:25.199 --> 50:28.960
A man who was living in Germany<br>would send regular payments to you.

50:28.960 --> 50:31.400
His name was Henry Reed.

50:31.400 --> 50:33.039
We are trying to find out why.

50:34.159 --> 50:35.400
Henry Reed.

50:36.480 --> 50:39.199
You are not the first person<br>to come and ask about him.

50:39.199 --> 50:42.440
You spoke to his son Daniel<br>over a year ago or so.

50:42.440 --> 50:44.800
And I will tell you the same<br>thing that I told him.

50:44.800 --> 50:47.920
Henry Reed made those<br>payments out of guilt.

50:48.920 --> 50:50.440
Guilt? For what?

50:51.960 --> 50:53.679
For what they did to my sister.

50:55.440 --> 50:57.400
She was only nine years old.

50:57.400 --> 51:01.440
And this Henry Reed thinks money<br>will, what? Make it better?

51:01.440 --> 51:03.360
Bring her to life?<br>They killed MY father...

51:03.360 --> 51:05.320
Mr Barzani, please. Slow down.

51:05.320 --> 51:09.079
Would you mind to tell me everything<br>you know, from the beginning?

51:12.199 --> 51:14.440
In 1991, I was just a boy.

51:14.440 --> 51:17.000
That's when they came<br>to my village...

51:18.199 --> 51:19.440
Who?

51:19.440 --> 51:23.159
Henry Reed. And his Army friend.

51:23.159 --> 51:24.719
A man called Stone.

51:46.199 --> 51:47.239
(How was he?)

51:47.239 --> 51:48.639
(Yeah, he's fine.)

51:50.440 --> 51:51.760
Thank you.

51:51.760 --> 51:52.840
It's fine.

51:54.840 --> 51:55.920
Where did you go?

51:57.639 --> 51:59.840
Just...work. Something came up.

52:04.800 --> 52:06.199
Look, um...

52:07.679 --> 52:10.000
Your dad had<br>a bit of an accident.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.320
I went into one of the drawers<br>in your bedroom,

52:12.320 --> 52:14.760
just looking for something<br>for him to wear...

52:14.760 --> 52:16.079
I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry.

52:18.079 --> 52:20.079
I, uh...

52:20.079 --> 52:24.199
I found the pictures.<br>You know, the scans, of the baby...

52:25.719 --> 52:27.079
So?

52:27.079 --> 52:28.880
So it's a huge part of your life

52:28.880 --> 52:31.320
and we've never really talked<br>about it.

52:34.000 --> 52:37.079
And I just think maybe you should be<br>with someone else.

52:37.079 --> 52:38.519
You know...

52:38.519 --> 52:40.800
Someone who can give you<br>what you want.

52:40.800 --> 52:42.840
You don't know what I need.

52:45.639 --> 52:48.679
It's not like we haven't been<br>honest with each other.

52:50.239 --> 52:51.800
We needed each other.

52:53.840 --> 52:56.519
Someone to hold on to<br>in the middle of all the...

52:59.159 --> 53:00.400
But now...

53:03.239 --> 53:04.960
I'm sorry, I'm not good at this.

53:04.960 --> 53:06.159
It's fine.

53:08.039 --> 53:09.840
I've been thinking the same.

53:11.800 --> 53:14.880
It's not right, what we've been<br>doing. We need to stop.

53:24.960 --> 53:29.840
The doc says that me and Gemma<br>could go back to England.

53:29.840 --> 53:31.360
Make a fresh start.

53:33.079 --> 53:34.679
I wonder whether he's right.

53:38.440 --> 53:40.159
You've been through it, you two.

53:42.800 --> 53:44.400
You deserve to be happy.

54:02.400 --> 54:04.639
Julien. Julien.

54:07.079 --> 54:09.159
I think the flight's on time.<br>You should check in.

54:10.760 --> 54:13.599
Thank you again. For all your help.

54:13.599 --> 54:15.519
I'd say it was my pleasure, but...

54:17.519 --> 54:21.440
You know you should go home.<br>You can have that operation.

54:21.440 --> 54:23.559
Not just run and hide from it.

54:23.559 --> 54:27.599
Says the man who refuses to go home,<br>even when asked by his employer.

54:27.599 --> 54:30.360
I know. I know.<br>But that's different.

54:30.360 --> 54:33.639
You know, I've had chemotherapy.<br>Radiotherapy too.

54:33.639 --> 54:38.760
I have had hope and had it snatched<br>from me all in the same week.

54:38.760 --> 54:42.280
In truth, I'm tired.<br>Perhaps I've had my time.

54:43.519 --> 54:46.880
But if there is a chance the<br>real Alice Webster is still alive

54:46.880 --> 54:49.119
I must do everything<br>in my power to find her.

54:50.840 --> 54:52.800
To do nothing or do something,<br>right?

54:52.800 --> 54:55.599
Yes. It's no choice at all.

54:57.639 --> 54:59.320
Goodbye.

54:59.320 --> 55:01.119
Farewell, my friend, good luck.

55:09.679 --> 55:11.000
'Hello?'

55:11.000 --> 55:12.719
Hello, Eve, it's Gemma.

55:14.559 --> 55:17.280
'I know this is awkward, but<br>there's no-one else I can...'

55:17.280 --> 55:18.599
Can we meet? Tonight.

55:18.599 --> 55:21.519
'I can't. I'm with my dad.'

55:22.679 --> 55:24.239
Tomorrow morning?

55:24.239 --> 55:26.119
What is it? What's it about?

55:28.039 --> 55:31.280
You know what I said earlier on<br>about not seeing something

55:31.280 --> 55:33.440
that's right in front of you.

55:33.440 --> 55:34.800
Well, I was right.

55:36.599 --> 55:38.800
We weren't looking hard enough, Eve.

55:40.880 --> 55:42.599
There was another girl.

56:37.679 --> 56:39.079
Voila.

57:38.400 --> 57:40.079
I'm afraid I'm taken.
