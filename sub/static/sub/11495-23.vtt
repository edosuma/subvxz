WEBVTT

00:07.664 --> 00:11.450
You are so pretty.
Thank you.

00:11.452 --> 00:13.919
Pretty, pretty, pretty,
pretty, pretty...

00:13.921 --> 00:16.839
Okay, okay, okay, pretty man
trying to drive a car here.

00:19.644 --> 00:23.179
How did you get more drunk
since we left the party?

00:23.181 --> 00:27.850
Well... I brought a roadie.

00:27.852 --> 00:29.352
Where did you get that?

00:29.354 --> 00:31.854
My purse.

00:31.856 --> 00:33.439
Hmm. Your purse.

00:35.026 --> 00:36.992
Oh, no, it spilled!

00:36.994 --> 00:38.861
Oh!

00:40.248 --> 00:41.947
Do you want some?

00:41.949 --> 00:44.700
No. You-you need
to get rid of that drink.

00:44.702 --> 00:47.870
Fine... Mr. Man.

00:50.541 --> 00:51.990
Oops!

00:51.992 --> 00:53.759
Okay.

00:53.761 --> 00:56.962
I think it's time to get Stacey
home and under the covers.

00:56.964 --> 01:01.267
I think it's time to get
Walden home and under Stacey.

01:02.185 --> 01:04.102
That's not going to happen.

01:04.105 --> 01:05.721
Boo!

01:05.723 --> 01:07.390
Maybe another time.

01:07.392 --> 01:09.108
Yay!

01:10.845 --> 01:14.029
I think I'm gonna take a little
nap before we get there.

01:14.031 --> 01:16.198
Okay.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.401
I'm so hungry.

01:18.403 --> 01:20.152
You'll be home soon, and then...

01:20.154 --> 01:22.655
Whoa, that-that
is not food.

01:24.491 --> 01:27.025
Are you sure
you don't want to stay, 'cause

01:27.027 --> 01:28.911
we could have sex?

01:28.913 --> 01:30.329
You've made that
abundantly clear.

01:30.331 --> 01:31.530
Uh, but no, thank you.

01:31.532 --> 01:34.133
And to have sex with me,
you need to be able

01:34.135 --> 01:36.552
to stand on one leg
and touch your nose.

01:38.422 --> 01:40.038
Ooh.

01:40.040 --> 01:42.057
Nope.

01:43.677 --> 01:44.844
Okay, let's...

01:44.846 --> 01:47.212
Ooh! Mojito.

01:47.214 --> 01:50.182
Okay, let's-let's
get you inside safe and sound.

01:50.184 --> 01:51.901
Yum.
Mm?

01:53.187 --> 01:54.603
Hello.

01:54.605 --> 01:55.905
Hi, Nana.

01:55.907 --> 01:58.441

to say I'm sorry.

02:23.166 --> 02:25.583
I'm not the kind of guy

02:28.088 --> 02:30.939
bring her home. I...

02:30.941 --> 02:32.624
We met at this video game
release party,

02:32.626 --> 02:33.925
and we started drinking
and talking.

02:33.927 --> 02:35.877
As it turns out, she was doing
more of the drinking,

02:35.879 --> 02:37.345
and I was doing
more of the talking.

02:37.347 --> 02:38.663
And here I am, still talking.

02:38.665 --> 02:40.598
Hi. I'm Walden Schmidt.

Nice to meet
you, Walden.

02:41.835 --> 02:43.051
Linda Pearson.

02:43.053 --> 02:45.002
Thank you for helping
my granddaughter.

02:45.004 --> 02:47.338
Your... You do not look
like you're old enough

02:47.340 --> 02:48.473
to have a granddaughter.

02:48.475 --> 02:52.610
The unexpected benefit
of being a slut at 18.

02:53.696 --> 02:55.513
And having a daughter
who followed suit.

02:55.515 --> 02:57.399
And, you know, from
the looks of it,

02:57.401 --> 03:01.453
Stacey is, uh, going to carry
on the proud family tradition.

03:01.455 --> 03:04.873
Some families hand down recipes.

03:04.875 --> 03:06.624
I appreciate you
being a gentleman.

03:06.626 --> 03:08.426
Sure. You know,

03:08.428 --> 03:10.412
I was... I was looking
at these photos.

03:10.414 --> 03:12.363
They're amazing. Who took these?

03:12.365 --> 03:13.214
Oh, I did.

03:13.216 --> 03:14.716
You took all of these?

03:14.718 --> 03:16.835
Yeah, I'm a
photographer. In fact,

03:16.837 --> 03:19.370
this is pretty much a record of
the last 40 years of my life.

03:19.372 --> 03:21.573
Well, hold on.
In this one,

03:21.575 --> 03:25.343
these guys are aiming their
machine guns at the camera,

03:25.345 --> 03:27.712
which means they're aiming
their machine guns at you.

03:27.714 --> 03:30.265
Yeah, I was on
assignment, and, uh,

03:30.267 --> 03:32.383
I needed a photo of
Nicaraguan Contras,

03:32.385 --> 03:34.886
and I guess nobody told
their elite death squad

03:34.888 --> 03:36.771
it was picture day.

03:36.773 --> 03:38.440
Wow.

03:38.442 --> 03:41.443
That's what I said when
they came over the hill.

03:41.445 --> 03:43.445
But it had a lot
more Fs in it.

03:44.914 --> 03:48.166
Thi-This is a picture
of Warren Beatty

03:48.168 --> 03:49.200
and Jack Nicholson.

03:49.202 --> 03:50.902
Yeah, I-I took some more photos

03:50.904 --> 03:54.172
in the Jacuzzi later,
but, uh, I can't display those.

03:55.708 --> 03:58.426
Yeah, and that's, um, the
Berlin Wall coming down,

03:58.428 --> 04:00.912
and-and that's
Tiananmen Square,

04:00.914 --> 04:02.881
and this is a dachshund

04:02.883 --> 04:05.517
in a hot dog bun.

04:05.519 --> 04:06.968
You're really talented.

04:06.970 --> 04:08.720
You're really sweet.

04:08.722 --> 04:10.588
Okay, yeah, I've taken up
enough of your time.

04:10.590 --> 04:12.223
I'm gonna get out
of your way now.

04:12.225 --> 04:13.591
Oh, you're not in my way.

04:13.593 --> 04:16.978
I was just going to make a cup
of tea and smoke a joint.

04:16.980 --> 04:19.029
Really?

04:19.031 --> 04:21.199
Yeah. Uh, you want to join me?

04:21.201 --> 04:23.451
That's my idea
of baking with Grandma.

04:27.623 --> 04:29.607
Dad? Walden?

04:29.609 --> 04:32.827
Jake?

04:33.879 --> 04:35.130
This is a surprise.

04:35.132 --> 04:37.081
So is this.

04:37.083 --> 04:39.784
What's on your face?

04:39.786 --> 04:41.285
Oh, uh, now that I'm back
in the dating pool,

04:41.287 --> 04:42.420
I want to look my best.

04:42.422 --> 04:44.923
Oh. It's not working.

04:44.925 --> 04:46.624
So, what-what are
you doing home?

04:46.626 --> 04:48.910
Oh, I got a few days pass,
you know, thought

04:48.912 --> 04:50.678
I'd come surprise you,
spend some time together.

04:50.680 --> 04:52.096
That's great.
Wait a second.

04:52.098 --> 04:54.732
Are you in trouble? Is somebody
pregnant? Do you need money?

04:54.734 --> 04:56.768
No, no, and always.

04:56.770 --> 04:59.821
Thing is, I'm gonna be
going away for a while.

04:59.823 --> 05:02.557
Damn it, I forgot jail.

05:02.559 --> 05:04.492
Not jail. Japan.

05:04.494 --> 05:05.527
Japan?

05:05.529 --> 05:06.861
Yeah. They needed an extra cook

05:06.863 --> 05:08.830
at the base over there,
so I volunteered.

05:08.832 --> 05:10.031
Really? Why?

05:10.033 --> 05:12.667
Why not?
I love Benihana.

05:12.669 --> 05:14.702
Oh-oh, my God.
W-When do you leave?

05:14.704 --> 05:15.703
Two weeks.

05:15.705 --> 05:16.821
Wait. Two weeks?!

05:16.823 --> 05:18.322
So-so this is probably
the last time

05:18.324 --> 05:19.991
I'm going to see you
for a while.

05:19.993 --> 05:22.154
Yeah, I guess, unless you're
willing to make the drive.

05:26.015 --> 05:28.165
So Nixon stands on the
helicopter steps, right,

05:28.167 --> 05:31.553
and he does this,
and I take the picture

05:31.555 --> 05:33.888
and I am so excited
that I don't even notice

05:33.890 --> 05:37.192
Strom Thurmond's hand
is on my ass.

05:37.194 --> 05:38.776
So, what did you do?

05:38.778 --> 05:40.812
I became a lifelong Democrat.

05:42.148 --> 05:44.716
Wow. You've seen
some incredible things.

05:44.718 --> 05:47.719
Oh, well, you can get into
some pretty amazing places

05:47.721 --> 05:50.705
with a camera, a press
pass, and no bra.

05:50.707 --> 05:53.208
Okay, I'm gonna stop
wearing a bra.

05:53.210 --> 05:55.710
You know, it's-it's nice
to have someone to talk to.

05:55.712 --> 05:58.830
Stacey thinks Nicaragua is a
gum you chew to stop smoking.

06:00.083 --> 06:04.786
She also thinks Mount Rushmore
is a natural phenomenon.

06:04.788 --> 06:06.421
It's not?

06:07.390 --> 06:09.874
Oh, man.

06:09.876 --> 06:11.208
I should really get going.

06:11.210 --> 06:13.978
Oh, but before you go,
you have to do something for me.

06:13.980 --> 06:15.647
Every person I meet

06:15.649 --> 06:17.482
poses for the same picture.

06:17.484 --> 06:19.100
Oh, I would be honored.

06:19.102 --> 06:21.069
Great. Okay, now,
stand by that wall.

06:21.071 --> 06:22.553
Okay.

06:22.555 --> 06:24.239
Yeah, and, uh,

06:24.241 --> 06:26.057
give me a great big smile.

06:26.859 --> 06:28.693
Now drop your
pants and moon me.

06:28.695 --> 06:31.279
What?

06:31.281 --> 06:34.666
<i>That's</i> the picture
I take of everyone.

06:34.668 --> 06:36.417
Okay, I'm still gonna moon you.

06:40.072 --> 06:42.040
So how long is
your tour of duty?

06:42.042 --> 06:44.759
And, yes, I know
I said "duty."

06:44.761 --> 06:48.129
Uh, a year, but if I do
really well, it could be longer.

06:48.131 --> 06:49.580
Okay, so a year.

06:50.432 --> 06:52.150
Hey.

06:52.152 --> 06:53.851
Hey, Walden.

06:53.853 --> 06:55.253
What are you
doing home?

06:55.255 --> 06:56.521
Oh, just visiting.

06:56.523 --> 06:58.389
He's being
transferred to Japan.

06:58.391 --> 07:00.441
Oh, what? That's amazing!

07:00.443 --> 07:03.194
I mean, I'll miss you,
but what a great opportunity.

07:03.196 --> 07:05.063
It's a beautiful country,
gorgeous women,

07:05.065 --> 07:07.782
one step closer
to having this house to myself.

07:07.784 --> 07:09.767
Yeah, the only thing
I'm worried about is,

07:09.769 --> 07:12.036
they still haven't found
Godzilla.

07:16.775 --> 07:19.210
How-how was the party?

07:19.212 --> 07:20.411
Oh, it was great.

07:20.413 --> 07:21.963
I-I met this really hot
22-year-old girl

07:21.965 --> 07:23.965
and spent the whole night
talking to her grandma.

07:23.967 --> 07:26.968
Oh, yeah, "talking
to her grandma."

07:27.753 --> 07:29.637
I know what that means.

07:35.511 --> 07:36.794
Do you?

07:36.796 --> 07:37.979
Are you kidding?

07:37.981 --> 07:39.480
Whenever I wear my uniform out,

07:39.482 --> 07:42.466
all the ladies let me talk
to their grandma.

07:48.907 --> 07:50.307
I'm just gonna talk to you.

07:50.309 --> 07:52.360
Wait, wait.

07:52.362 --> 07:54.195
So, uh, you met
this hot 22-year-old,

07:54.197 --> 07:56.664
but you spent the night talking
to her grandmother?

07:56.666 --> 07:58.783
That's like going to the
International House of Pancakes

07:58.785 --> 08:00.484
and ordering a bowl of dust.

08:00.486 --> 08:02.754
Okay, clearly, I can't talk
to either of you.

08:02.756 --> 08:04.706
No. No, seriously. Why?

08:04.708 --> 08:08.793
Well, I'm sick of dating
these goofy, shallow girls

08:08.795 --> 08:11.679
that all have a tiny dog
in their purse.

08:11.681 --> 08:15.550
All right,
"tiny dog in their purse."

08:15.552 --> 08:18.770
I'm missing you less and less.

08:20.806 --> 08:22.724
She's really interesting.

08:22.726 --> 08:25.727
Is she like a rapping granny
or something?

08:25.729 --> 08:27.612
Stop talking!

08:29.314 --> 08:31.015
Well, she's smart and funny,

08:31.017 --> 08:32.984
and she's had all
these incredible experiences.

08:32.986 --> 08:34.818
There's just one problem.

08:34.821 --> 08:36.871
What? She can't drive at night?

08:39.375 --> 08:41.808
No. If I want
to see Linda again,

08:41.811 --> 08:45.029
I got to see Stacey again,
and if, if I see her,

08:45.031 --> 08:47.364
she's gonna want
to have sex with me.

08:53.505 --> 08:55.757
Could you ask Walden
why that's a problem?

09:00.846 --> 09:03.181
This is nice, huh?

09:03.183 --> 09:04.565
Yes, it is.

09:05.818 --> 09:07.985
In a truly weird way.

09:07.987 --> 09:09.220
There's nothing weird

09:09.222 --> 09:10.822
about three people
having dinner together.

09:10.824 --> 09:13.608
It is when two of them
are on a date.

09:13.610 --> 09:15.276
Oh, come on. We
want you here.

09:15.278 --> 09:17.278
Isn't that right, Stacey?
Huh?

09:17.280 --> 09:19.914
Yeah. Totes.

09:19.916 --> 09:22.533
Well, in that case,
I'm totes glad to be here.

09:22.535 --> 09:26.237
So, are-are you into
photography, too?

09:26.239 --> 09:29.791
Oh, yeah,
I take tons of selfies!

09:31.627 --> 09:34.178
♪ Instagram!

09:35.482 --> 09:38.633
So, how did you two wind up
living together?

09:38.635 --> 09:42.470
Ugh. She's my grandma. Duh.

09:43.806 --> 09:45.422
Stacey's looking
for a job out here.

09:45.424 --> 09:47.809
She just graduated
from Arizona State.

09:47.811 --> 09:49.927
Oh, wow. What
was your major?

09:49.929 --> 09:51.312
Communications.

09:51.314 --> 09:54.615
You know, I've always wondered,
what is that exactly?

09:54.617 --> 09:59.287
Well... it's kind of hard
to put into words.

09:59.289 --> 10:02.039
I mean, you know,
it's, like, talking and stuff.

10:02.041 --> 10:04.108
Uh-huh.

10:04.110 --> 10:06.127
120 grand.

10:07.012 --> 10:08.779
Ooh.

10:08.781 --> 10:11.165
Hey, are we gonna
have sex tonight?

10:11.167 --> 10:13.634

communications degree at work.

10:13.636 --> 10:15.887
I hadn't really thought
about it.

10:15.889 --> 10:19.623
'Cause, if not, I just got
invited to a killer party.

10:20.676 --> 10:22.510
Well, I-I wouldn't want
to keep you if...

10:22.512 --> 10:25.313
Great. My friends are gonna
swing by and pick me up.

10:25.315 --> 10:27.682
Okay. Do-do you want
to eat something first?

10:27.684 --> 10:29.016
Oh, God, no.

10:29.018 --> 10:31.185
I hate drinking
on a full stomach.

10:31.187 --> 10:34.021
In fact, I'm gonna go throw up
and make a little room.

10:36.074 --> 10:38.025
Pretty sure she's going
to live with me forever.

10:38.027 --> 10:40.444
I got one of those.

10:43.782 --> 10:46.317
I think pizza's the thing
I'm gonna miss the most

10:46.319 --> 10:48.202
when I go to Japan.

10:48.204 --> 10:51.322
Really? Pizza?

10:51.324 --> 10:55.176
Yeah. Well, that and sushi.

10:56.795 --> 10:59.430
Okay. You know what?
This is ridiculous.

10:59.432 --> 11:01.883
I mean, you're-you're
gonna be gone for a year,

11:01.885 --> 11:03.167

here watching

11:03.169 --> 11:04.769

<i>Freakin' Stars.</i>

11:04.771 --> 11:07.605
Well, do you want to watch
<i>Hillbilly Gynecologist?</i>

11:07.607 --> 11:09.857
No. No, I don't want
to watch anything.

11:09.859 --> 11:12.860
I want to do something.
Hey, hey, what do you say

11:12.862 --> 11:15.112
we go on a father-son
road trip?

11:15.114 --> 11:17.448
Okay. Can we go to Vegas?

11:17.450 --> 11:19.400
Uh, well, that would be great
except you're not old enough

11:19.402 --> 11:20.451
to drink or gamble.

11:20.453 --> 11:24.372
Right. I don't drink.

11:24.374 --> 11:26.040
Oh, uh, you know
what we could do?

11:26.042 --> 11:29.577
We could see beloved Canadian
songbird Celine Dion.

11:29.579 --> 11:31.913
She is to die for.

11:32.664 --> 11:35.499
Dad?
Mm-hmm.

11:35.501 --> 11:37.802
I'm gonna be going away
for a while.

11:37.804 --> 11:40.922

to tell me, now's the time.

11:43.058 --> 11:45.376
Well, thank you
very much for dinner.

11:45.378 --> 11:48.579

11:48.581 --> 11:51.098

12:58.874 --> 13:00.825
I can't. I'm still
sorting things out

13:00.827 --> 13:02.277

13:02.279 --> 13:04.295
Oh, right. The grandma-
granddaughter thing.

You know, if you get
the mom in there,

not a sniper.

Yeah, the Big Apple.

13:19.195 --> 13:22.180

13:22.182 --> 13:25.216

Give me a hug.

13:25.218 --> 13:27.018
Thanks for everything, Berta.

13:27.020 --> 13:29.721
You take care of
yourself, Taterhead.

Well, this is a little awkward.

13:47.440 --> 13:50.742
Um, Stacey's actually
out on a date.

13:50.744 --> 13:52.560
Oh, no. I'm devastated.

13:52.562 --> 13:54.945
I don't think I should be alone.

13:54.947 --> 13:56.331
Look, I'm very flattered,

13:56.333 --> 13:58.666
but I think
we covered this last night.

13:58.668 --> 13:59.884
I brought weed.

14:02.005 --> 14:04.138
Oh, honey, that's not weed.

14:04.140 --> 14:05.807
Come on in.

14:07.760 --> 14:10.011

to be tipped.

14:23.526 --> 14:25.360
Since when do you tip?

14:27.146 --> 14:28.413
That's witty banter.

14:28.415 --> 14:30.481
Best thing about a road trip.
Yeah, yeah.

14:30.483 --> 14:32.784
That and joking around.

14:36.922 --> 14:39.290
Can I tell you
something?

14:39.292 --> 14:40.625
Of course.

14:41.510 --> 14:43.494
Back when you and Mom broke up,

14:43.496 --> 14:45.013
I thought it was your fault,

14:45.015 --> 14:47.548
and I was kind of mad at you
for a long time.

14:47.550 --> 14:49.834
Oh, Jake, well, it was...

14:49.836 --> 14:52.720
very complicated. You know,
a lot of things got said...

14:52.722 --> 14:54.722
Yeah, well, let me finish.

14:54.724 --> 14:56.941
Then Mom married Herb

14:56.943 --> 14:58.976
and then broke up with him,

14:58.978 --> 15:03.281
so now I'm thinking
maybe it wasn't all you.

15:03.283 --> 15:05.817
Well, I appreciate that.

15:05.819 --> 15:09.537
But I'm not gonna say anything
bad about your mother.

15:10.406 --> 15:11.956
But you're hoping
I will, right?

15:11.958 --> 15:14.158
Oh, absolutely.

15:14.960 --> 15:17.328
So, after I dropped out
of college,

15:17.330 --> 15:19.831
me and my buddy developed
this software, and we sold it

15:19.833 --> 15:21.249
for, like, a stupid amount
of money.

15:21.251 --> 15:22.717
And then I lost half of it
in my divorce,

15:22.719 --> 15:24.752
so then I developed some more
software and made it all back,

15:24.754 --> 15:26.971
and I am really freaking high.

15:28.257 --> 15:31.509
I feel like I've been talking
for over a year.

15:31.511 --> 15:33.561
You kind of have.

15:35.098 --> 15:37.565
So, what do you do now?

15:38.400 --> 15:40.735
A lot of this.

15:40.737 --> 15:42.253
Oh, Walden.

15:42.255 --> 15:44.439
You did yo life backwards.

15:44.441 --> 15:46.007
Yeah. You're
supposed to spend

15:46.009 --> 15:49.410
your youth ad-adventurizing.

15:49.412 --> 15:51.729
A-And then you go into business.

15:51.731 --> 15:55.450
Wait. You said "adventurizing."

15:55.452 --> 15:57.785
That's not even a word.

15:57.787 --> 16:00.037
It is now. I just...

16:00.039 --> 16:01.622
inventorized it.

16:03.343 --> 16:06.010
No, I mean it.
I mean it. You...

16:06.012 --> 16:10.515

exciting in your life.

16:10.517 --> 16:11.883

Have you ever been chased
by a lion in the Serengeti?

16:15.254 --> 16:18.189
No. But one time
I got in a slap fight

16:18.191 --> 16:19.941
with the guy who plays Simba
at Disneyland.

16:24.697 --> 16:28.232
H-Have you ever been
at a voodoo ritual in Haiti?

16:28.234 --> 16:31.202
Or-or-or panned for gold
in the Yukon?

16:31.204 --> 16:33.988
Or...
made out with Buzz Aldrin?

16:33.990 --> 16:36.657
Ooh, do I want to make out
with Buzz Aldrin?

16:36.659 --> 16:37.909

that thing in your life
