WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?

00:03.875 --> 00:06.000
I MEAN, THEY'RE DANCING.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.834
NOBODY DANCES
IN THE KITCHEN.

00:07.834 --> 00:10.250
MAYBE OUR PARENTS
DANCED IN THE KITCHEN.

00:10.250 --> 00:11.834
MY PARENTS
LOVE THIS MOVIE.

00:11.834 --> 00:13.166
THIS IS, LIKE,
THE DEFINITIVE MOVIE

00:13.166 --> 00:16.000
OF THE ENTIRE
BABY BOOMER GENERATION.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.333
DO YOUR PARENTS
DANCE IN THE KITCHEN?

00:18.333 --> 00:20.375
MY PARENTS?

00:20.375 --> 00:22.875
NO, THEY DEFINITELY DON'T
DANCE IN THE KITCHEN.

00:24.208 --> 00:26.083
OH, I TOOK ALL
THE MOVIE POSTERS
OFF MY WALL.

00:26.083 --> 00:27.375
EVERYTHING'S
IN QUESTION.

00:27.375 --> 00:29.667
I FIGURED WHY NOT
SOMETHING UNEXPECTED
FOR MOVIE NIGHT?

00:29.667 --> 00:33.708
OH, SO WE'RE SCALING
NEW HEIGHTS OF MOUNT LAME?

00:33.708 --> 00:35.500
SORRY, JOEY. TONIGHT'S
ACTIVITIES WERE MEANT

00:35.500 --> 00:36.917
TO CALM YOUR NERVES,
NOT AGITATE THEM.

00:36.917 --> 00:39.208
WELL, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

00:39.208 --> 00:41.166
I MEAN, THIS BED
AND BREAKFAST HAS BEEN
OPEN FOR A DAY--

00:41.166 --> 00:42.875
A VERY COSTLY BED
AND BREAKFAST, MIND YOU--

00:42.875 --> 00:44.125
AND THERE ARE NO GUESTS.

00:44.125 --> 00:46.375
HAVE EITHER ONE OF YOU
CHECKED THE RESERVATIONS
LIST?

00:46.375 --> 00:48.041
THERE'S NOT A NAME
TO BE FOUND, NOT A ONE.

00:48.041 --> 00:50.041
IT TAKES TIME TO
ESTABLISH A REPUTATION.

00:50.041 --> 00:52.417
DAWSON, BESSIE AND I
HAVE INVESTED
EVERY DIME WE HAVE.

00:52.417 --> 00:55.417
ALONG WITH GUESTS,
TIME IS ANOTHER THING
THAT WE DON'T HAVE.

[SIGHS] ACTUALLY,
I'M PERFECTLY CONTENT

01:11.250 --> 01:13.792
WITH MY LONG DISTANCE
SERVICE, THANK YOU.

01:13.792 --> 01:16.583
BUT HOW ABOUT YOU? I MEAN,
THINKING ABOUT A VACATION?
COME TO THE CAPE.

01:26.500 --> 01:28.208
OH, COME ON, JO,
KEEP THE FAITH.

01:28.208 --> 01:29.291
IS THAT ALL
YOU HAVE TO SAY,

01:29.291 --> 01:31.208
CONSIDERING THAT YOU
WERE THE PRIMARY FORCE

01:31.208 --> 01:32.583
THAT ESCORTED BESSIE
AND I DOWN THIS ROAD
TO ECONOMIC RUIN?

01:32.583 --> 01:35.708
ALL I DID WAS FIGURE
OUT A WAY TO KICK IN
SOME FREE LABOR.

01:35.708 --> 01:38.333
YOU, PACEY WITTER,
SINGLE-HANDEDLY ENCOURAGED
THIS PIPE DREAM.

01:38.333 --> 01:39.542
I MEAN, YOU SHOULD KNOW
BETTER THAN TO GO AROUND

01:39.542 --> 01:42.834
INSPIRING FINANCIALLY AND
SPIRITUALLY BEREFT PEOPLE.

01:42.834 --> 01:45.625

HI. WE WERE
WONDERING...

02:01.625 --> 02:03.208
YES?

02:03.208 --> 02:06.708
HAVE YOU ACCEPTED
THE LORD JESUS CHRIST
AS YOUR PERSONAL SAVIOR?

02:08.500 --> 02:09.917
GOD LOVES YOU.

03:13.875 --> 03:15.000
HEY.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.166
HEY, STRANGER.

03:16.166 --> 03:18.166
WHERE YOU BEEN
ALL WEEK?

03:18.166 --> 03:19.291
MMM, WORKING.

03:19.291 --> 03:20.458
MS. FRECKLING MUST
BE KEEPING YOU
BUSY, HUH?

03:20.458 --> 03:23.125
I DON'T THINK
I'VE SEEN YOU
SINCE CAPEFEST.

03:23.125 --> 03:24.000
WELL, ACTUALLY,
I'VE BEEN WORKING
AT THE BASS.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.834
MY FAVORITE
RESTAURANT.

03:26.834 --> 03:28.166
DO YOU WORK THERE
FULL TIME?

03:28.166 --> 03:30.458
OH, NO, JUST
A WEEK-LONG GIG.

03:30.458 --> 03:33.125
MS. FRECKLING HEARD
THAT THEY HAD SOME
ROOF PROBLEMS,

03:33.125 --> 03:34.458
SO I OFFERED
MY SERVICES.

03:34.458 --> 03:36.750
GOOD. IT'S AN EXPENSIVE
PLACE. THEY BETTER
PAY YOU WELL.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.208
THEY DIDN'T.

03:38.208 --> 03:40.959
BUT INSTEAD OF CASH,
I OPTED FOR
A FREE DINNER.

03:41.875 --> 03:44.500
THE IMPLICATION BEING?

03:44.500 --> 03:46.625
THAT YOU AND I
ARE GONNA EAT THERE?

03:46.625 --> 03:49.917
THAT'S FUNNY,
'CAUSE I DON'T RECALL
BEING ASKED.

03:49.917 --> 03:50.875
YOU WEREN'T.

03:50.875 --> 03:53.208
SEE, I FINALLY
FIGURED YOU OUT, JEN.

03:53.208 --> 03:55.458
WHEN GIVEN
THE OPPORTUNITY
TO SAY NO, YOU DO.

03:55.458 --> 03:57.834
SO I'M NOT GIVING YOU
THE OPPORTUNITY.

03:57.834 --> 04:01.834
BUT THEN YOU'RE ALSO NOT
GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY
TO SAY YES.

04:01.834 --> 04:04.250
WOULD YOU? SAY YES?

04:04.250 --> 04:05.917
PROBABLY NOT.

04:05.917 --> 04:07.542
WELL, THAT'S WHY
I'M NOT ASKING.

04:07.542 --> 04:09.750
HENRY, WE'VE BEEN
OVER THIS BEFORE.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.291

DON'T GET AHEAD OF YOURSELF.
I NEVER CALLED IT A DATE.

I'D SAID WE'D EAT DINNER, YOU
KNOW. GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

04:16.208 --> 04:17.791

ENOUGH TIMES

04:17.791 --> 04:18.708
TO SPOT A DATE

DO YOU REALLY THINK
A KID LIKE ME

TO CONSIDER HIMSELF
WORTHY

04:30.208 --> 04:32.583
SEE MY POINT.
WHAT'S IT GONNA BE?

04:32.583 --> 04:35.500
IT'S GONNA BE "LET
ME THINK ABOUT IT."

04:35.500 --> 04:37.208
NOW WE'RE TALKING.

04:37.208 --> 04:38.667
YEAH, BUT
I DIDN'T SAY YES.

04:38.667 --> 04:40.333
BUT YOU DIDN'T SAY NO.

I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.
I'M LATE FOR CLASS.

TURN INTO A PLAYBILL
BY MONDAY.

04:59.625 --> 05:01.959
IN ADDITION TO WHICH,
I HAVE TO PICK UP
THE POSTERS,

GET THE TICKETS

05:06.208 --> 05:08.291

NEXT WEEK.

05:08.291 --> 05:10.333
OH, AND DID I MENTION
THAT I'M A STUDENT

05:10.333 --> 05:12.458

CALLED HOMEWORK?

05:12.458 --> 05:14.500
AND YOU'RE NOT
VERY FAMILIAR

05:14.500 --> 05:16.125

PROGRAM, ARE YOU?

05:16.125 --> 05:17.708
UM, WHAT
GAVE THAT AWAY?

05:17.708 --> 05:20.625
EACH OF YOUR WORDS ARE
IN A DIFFERENT FONT.

05:20.625 --> 05:22.125
IT'S A STYLE CHOICE.

05:22.125 --> 05:23.625
AND UPSIDE DOWN.

IT'S A BOLD
STYLE CHOICE.

YEAH, RIGHT.

I DON'T KNOW HOW
YOU'RE KEEPING IT
TOGETHER.

05:38.583 --> 05:39.667
I WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO HANDLE ALL THIS.

05:39.667 --> 05:42.208
WELL, YOU WOULD IF YOU HAD
A SUPPORTIVE FAMILY

05:42.208 --> 05:43.250
TO COME HOME TO
EVERY NIGHT.

05:43.250 --> 05:45.208
[LAUGHS] THANKS, BUT
I'M HAPPY WHERE I AM.

05:45.208 --> 05:48.000
YOU COULDN'T
BE HAPPY AT HOME?

05:48.000 --> 05:49.583
NOT WITH HIM THERE, NO.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.000

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
[LAUGHS] YEAH,
I'M SURE HE DOES.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.667
ALL THOSE FATHER-SON
HEART-TO-HEARTS
WE USED TO HAVE.

05:55.667 --> 05:57.125
IT'LL BE DIFFERENT.

05:58.542 --> 06:00.959
OK, SO HE KNOWS
THAT I DON'T WANT
TO MOVE HOME,

06:00.959 --> 06:04.792
SO HE ENLISTS YOU
TO SPEAK FOR HIM?

06:04.792 --> 06:06.333
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS,
ISN'T IT?

06:07.375 --> 06:09.250
YOU KNOW WHAT, JACK?
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP,

06:09.250 --> 06:12.166
BUT I CAN MANAGE
ON MY OWN.

06:15.166 --> 06:15.625
SEE YOU.

06:19.458 --> 06:22.959
BESS, I GOTTA BE
HONEST WITH YOU.

06:22.959 --> 06:24.250
I SPOKE TO OUR MANAGER
ABOUT YOU,

06:24.250 --> 06:26.542
I MADE A PERSONAL PLEA.

06:26.542 --> 06:28.792
BUT YOU'RE A SINGLE MOTHER
WITH MULTIPLE DEPENDENTS,

06:28.792 --> 06:31.250
AND AN INCOME-TO-DEBT RATIO
THAT DOESN'T EVEN QUALIFY

06:31.250 --> 06:33.708
FOR OUR MOST
LIBERAL PROFILE.

06:33.708 --> 06:37.708
ISN'T THERE SOMETHING
YOU COULD SUGGEST,
SOME SOLUTION?

06:37.708 --> 06:40.417
WELL, YOU COULD DO
WHAT A LOT OF SMALL
BUSINESSES DO,

06:40.417 --> 06:43.458
AND THAT'S LEVERAGE
YOUR ASSETS.

06:43.458 --> 06:45.375
UNFORTUNATELY,
OUR MICROSOFT OPTIONS
HAVE BEEN CALLED

06:45.375 --> 06:46.625
AND OUR YACHT
IS IN HOCK.

06:46.625 --> 06:49.083
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT
TAKING OUT A MORTGAGE?

06:49.083 --> 06:51.125
ON THE HOUSE?

06:51.125 --> 06:53.041
IT IS PAID FOR,
FREE AND CLEAR.

06:53.041 --> 06:55.000
DO YOU HAVE
AN APPLICATION?

06:58.417 --> 07:01.959
I'M JUST THINKING
ABOUT IT.

07:01.959 --> 07:03.583
BESSIE, IT'S OUR HOUSE.
WHERE WE LIVE.

07:03.583 --> 07:05.083
THE ONLY CONNECTION
WE HAVE TO MOM.

07:05.083 --> 07:06.500
HOW CAN YOU EVEN
THINK ABOUT IT?

07:06.500 --> 07:09.041
JOEY, EVERYTHING TAKES
LONGER AND COSTS MORE
THAN WE EXPECT.

07:09.041 --> 07:11.333
IF THERE'S A WAY
TO TAKE A LITTLE OUT,
THEN MAYBE WE SHOULD.

07:11.333 --> 07:13.834
WELL, YOU CAN'T DO
SOMETHING LIKE THIS
WITHOUT MY APPROVAL,

07:13.834 --> 07:14.917
AND I'M NOT
GIVING IT TO YOU.

07:14.917 --> 07:17.083
ACTUALLY, I CAN.
I'M AN ADULT.

07:17.083 --> 07:18.583
YOU'RE
A 16-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

07:18.583 --> 07:21.500
BESSIE, I AM YOUR SISTER,
A PART OF THIS FAMILY.

07:21.500 --> 07:23.291
IF THIS THING
DOESN'T WORK OUT,
I LOSE MY HOUSE,

07:23.291 --> 07:25.917
THE ONLY TANGIBLE CONNECTION--
SHE LEFT IT TO ME, JOEY.

07:25.917 --> 07:29.542
JUST LIKE SHE LEFT ME
IN CHARGE AROUND HERE
UNTIL YOU TURN 18.

07:29.542 --> 07:31.667
THAT'S A RESPONSIBILITY
YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND.

07:31.667 --> 07:33.458
I KNOW ALL ABOUT
RESPONSIBILITY.

07:33.458 --> 07:36.166
DO YOU? BECAUSE UNTIL
YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO HUMILIATE YOURSELF

07:36.166 --> 07:39.667
BY ASKING SOME TRUST FUND
SNOB WHO LOOKED DOWN
ON YOU IN HIGH SCHOOL

07:39.667 --> 07:41.667
FOR MONEY, I DON'T
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT
WITH YOU ANYMORE.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.500
DAWSON?

07:55.500 --> 07:56.792
HEY.

07:56.792 --> 07:58.959
I FIGURED EVEN
IF MY FILM CAREER
IS IN NO-MAN'S LAND,

07:58.959 --> 08:02.083
I COULD STILL AT
LEAST PUT THIS THING
TO GOOD USE, RIGHT?

08:02.083 --> 08:03.291
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:03.291 --> 08:05.834
MAKING A VIRTUAL TOUR
OF CAPESIDE'S NEWEST B&B.

08:05.834 --> 08:07.166
WE POST THIS THING
ON THE WEB,

08:07.166 --> 08:08.583
LINK IT UP TO ALL
THE CAPE COD VISITOR
INFORMATION SITES.

08:08.583 --> 08:11.083
DAWSON, WE DON'T
EXACTLY HAVE THE MONEY

08:11.083 --> 08:13.333
FOR SUCH FRIVOLOUS THINGS
KNOWN AS ADVERTISING.

08:13.333 --> 08:14.834
RIGHT, WHICH IS
WHERE THIS COMES IN.

08:14.834 --> 08:16.041
LOOK, I REALLY
APPRECIATE THE OFFER, BUT--

08:16.041 --> 08:18.875
NO BUTs, JO.
THIS IS ACTUALLY
A REALLY GOOD IDEA.

08:18.875 --> 08:21.000
LOOK AT THIS PLACE.
WHO WOULDN'T WANT
TO COME STAY HERE

08:21.000 --> 08:22.625
IF THEY COULD SEE IT
FROM EVERY ANGLE

08:22.625 --> 08:25.250
AND MEET THE CHARMING
PROPRIETORS BEFOREHAND.

08:25.250 --> 08:28.083
[LAUGHS]
UH, JOEY, IF YOU COULD
TRY TO LOOK WELCOMING,

08:28.083 --> 08:30.792
THAT WOULD BE GREAT,
'CAUSE ANXIETY REALLY
DOESN'T FIT IN

08:30.792 --> 08:33.500
WITH THIS WHOLE HOMEY,
"COME STAY WITH US"
THING WE'RE GOING FOR.

08:33.500 --> 08:36.041
DAWSON, I DO TOILETS
AND I DO WINDOWS.

08:36.041 --> 08:37.917
I DRAW THE LINE
AT FAUX PERKINESS.

08:37.917 --> 08:38.833
OK.

08:40.792 --> 08:42.958
LET ME TELL YOU, KIDDIES,
WE ARE LOOKING GOOD,

08:42.958 --> 08:43.958
LOOKING GOOD.

08:43.958 --> 08:45.667
WHAT CANARY
DID YOU SWALLOW?

08:45.667 --> 08:50.208
WELL, AFTER HAVING FELT
JUST A TEENSY-WEENSY
LITTLE BIT OF GUILT

08:50.208 --> 08:53.542
OVER HAVING
"WRONGFULLY INSPIRED"
THIS ESTABLISHMENT,

08:53.542 --> 08:58.291
I TOOK IT UPON MYSELF
TO EXPOSE THE POTTER B&B
TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD

08:58.291 --> 09:00.083
VIA THE MIGHTY PEN OF
MR. FREDERICK FRICKE.

09:00.083 --> 09:02.125
FRED WHO?

09:02.125 --> 09:04.291
FRICKE. HE'S,
UH, I DON'T KNOW,

09:04.291 --> 09:06.291
HE'S LIKE THE ROGER EBERT
OF THE B&B WORLD.

09:06.291 --> 09:09.083
WRITES FOR TRAVEL,
TRAVEL AND LEISURE,
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,

09:09.083 --> 09:12.000
HE WRITES FOR
THE NEW YORK TIMES
TRAVEL SECTION--

09:12.000 --> 09:13.208
THE NEXT EDITION OF WHICH
WILL HAVE NOTHING

09:13.208 --> 09:16.250
BUT GLOWING THINGS TO SAY
ABOUT THIS ESTABLISHMENT,

09:16.250 --> 09:19.375
BECAUSE ONE MR. FRED FRICKE
IS FREQUENTING HERE.

09:19.375 --> 09:22.000
HE'S COMING HERE?

09:22.000 --> 09:24.041
OH, YEAH.
HE'S ON HIS WAY BACK
TO BOSTON RIGHT NOW.

09:24.041 --> 09:26.333
JUST HAPPENED TO FIT
RIGHT INTO HIS PLANS.
I GAVE HIM A CALL.

09:26.333 --> 09:27.708
ARE YOU INSANE?

09:27.708 --> 09:29.333
HAVE YOU SEEN
THE HALF-FINISHED ROOM?

09:29.333 --> 09:31.125
HAVE YOU TASTED
BESSIE'S BLUEBERRY
PANCAKES?

09:31.125 --> 09:34.125
WE'RE NOT READY, NOT TO MENTION
THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY GUESTS.

09:34.125 --> 09:35.500
I BEG TO DIFFER.
WE DO HAVE GUESTS.

09:35.500 --> 09:38.166
NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE GUESTS,
WE HAVE THE PERFECT GUEST

09:38.166 --> 09:41.917
FOR THE PERFECT
HEART-WARMING WEEKEND
AT YOUR LOCAL B&B.

09:41.917 --> 09:44.166
GUESTS,
IF YOU WOULD, PLEASE.

09:44.166 --> 09:46.625
WE HAVE THE SWEET,
GOD-FEARING GRANDMOTHER

09:46.625 --> 09:48.792
HERE TO HELP HER GRANDKIDS
TRY TO RECONNECT

09:48.792 --> 09:49.750
TO THE MAGICAL
CREEKSIDE VILLAGE

09:49.750 --> 09:52.583
WHERE SHE FROLICKED
AS A LITTLE GIRL.

09:52.583 --> 09:55.250
I'LL NEED
AN 8 A.M.
WAKE-UP CALL.

09:55.250 --> 09:57.917
YEAH, AND I TAKE MY OJ
FRESHLY SQUEEZED.

09:57.917 --> 09:59.000
BLACK COFFEE FOR ME,

09:59.000 --> 10:02.083
AND GOD HELP YOU
IF YOU WAKE ME
BEFORE NOON.

10:02.083 --> 10:04.917
AND JUST TO MAKE SURE
THAT OUR HOME IS FILLED

10:04.917 --> 10:07.375
WITH HAPPY,
BOISTEROUS PEOPLE,

10:07.375 --> 10:08.750
WE HAVE A LOVING,
MARRIED COUPLE

10:08.750 --> 10:12.667
HERE TO SPEND A ROMANTIC
WEEKEND GETAWAY.

10:23.083 --> 10:25.458
ONE MINOR DETAIL. DON'T
YOU THINK YOU COULD'VE
ASKED ME FIRST?

10:25.458 --> 10:26.917
YOU COULD'VE LEFT
MY PARENTS OUT OF IT?

10:26.917 --> 10:27.708
IT WAS RECKLESS.
AND INSENSITIVE.

10:27.708 --> 10:30.041
OK, ONE AT A TIME,
SHALL WE?

10:30.041 --> 10:31.875
STARTING WITH YOU.
I ONLY ASKED MITCH
TO HELP, OK?

10:31.875 --> 10:34.458
IT WAS HIS IDEA
TO BRING GALE ALONG.

10:34.458 --> 10:35.959
HIS IDEA?
YES, HIS IDEA,

10:35.959 --> 10:37.000
SO IF YOU WANT TO TEAR
SOMEBODY'S HEAD OFF,

10:37.000 --> 10:39.291
WHY DON'T YOU TRY
THE GUY THAT SIRED YOU.

10:39.291 --> 10:41.291
AND AS FOR YOU,
HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY
BE SO UNGRATEFUL

10:41.291 --> 10:43.625
AFTER JUST HAVING WITNESSED
AN OUTPOURING OF LOVE

10:43.625 --> 10:45.208
THAT WOULD HAVE MADE
GEORGE BAILEY PROUD?

10:45.208 --> 10:47.625
LOOK, THERE IS NOTHING
WONDERFUL ABOUT MY LIFE
RIGHT NOW, OK?

10:47.625 --> 10:49.083
SO I DON'T CARE
HOW YOU DO IT,

10:49.083 --> 10:51.333
BUT YOU GET MR. FRICKE
ON THE PHONE
AND YOU TELL HIM

10:51.333 --> 10:52.625
THAT THERE IS
NO ROOM AT THE INN.

10:52.625 --> 10:54.125
WHY?
BECAUSE.

10:54.125 --> 10:55.625
YOU DON'T SHOW
A MOVIE REVIEWER
A ROUGH CUT

10:55.625 --> 10:57.792
AND YOU DON'T SERVE
A FOOD CRITIC YOUR FIRST
STAB AT A NEW RECIPE,

10:57.792 --> 11:00.542
ESPECIALLY IF THAT RECIPE
IS YOUR LAST CHANCE

11:00.542 --> 11:01.959
OF KEEPING A ROOF
OVER YOUR HEAD.

11:01.959 --> 11:03.917
WHAT?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"LAST CHANCE?"

11:03.917 --> 11:07.125
BESSIE IS THINKING ABOUT
TAKING OUT A MORTGAGE.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.333
WHAT? A MOR--
YOU CAN'T LET HER
RISK THE HOUSE.

11:09.333 --> 11:13.333
DAWSON, DOES THE TERM
"LEGAL GUARDIAN"
MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

11:13.333 --> 11:16.917
UM, I'M SORRY, JO.
I'LL MAKE THIS RIGHT
RIGHT NOW. OK?

11:16.917 --> 11:18.542
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

11:22.667 --> 11:24.166
DON'T TELL ME,
THE FULLER BRUSH MAN?

11:24.166 --> 11:27.917
HARDLY. FRED FRICKE,
BED AND BREAKFAST
QUARTERLY.

11:31.333 --> 11:34.250
IS NOW A BAD TIME?

11:34.250 --> 11:37.166
NO, NOT AT ALL.

11:43.583 --> 11:45.166
OH, HI, HONEY.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.458
I SEE YOU TWO
ARE STAYING IN
THE HONEYMOON SUITE.

11:48.458 --> 11:52.708
[SIGHS] OH, WE'RE JUST
HERE TO HELP OUT JOEY
AND BESSIE, HONEY.

11:52.708 --> 11:54.708
LATER TONIGHT, AFTER
THE CRITIC IS ASLEEP,

11:54.708 --> 11:56.000
YOUR DAD'S GONNA
GO HOME AND CRASH.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.750
DON'T YOU THINK
IT MIGHT BE
A LITTLE CONFUSING,

11:59.750 --> 12:02.583
EVEN HURTFUL, TO
THE CHILD OF DIVORCE

12:02.583 --> 12:05.792
TO SEE HIS PARENTS
PLAY-ACTING
A HAPPY MARRIAGE?

12:05.792 --> 12:06.708
WELL, LIKE YOUR
MOTHER SAID, DAWSON,

12:06.708 --> 12:09.458
WE'RE JUST HERE
TO HELP OUT.

12:09.458 --> 12:12.208
DAD, PACEY ASKED YOU
TO HELP OUT.

12:12.208 --> 12:13.834
HE DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT MOM.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.875
EASY.

12:15.875 --> 12:18.417
DAWSON, LISTEN,
YOU'RE SEEING SOMETHING
DARK AND COMPLEX HERE.

12:18.417 --> 12:20.750
THERE'S NOTHING THERE.

12:20.750 --> 12:22.250
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SEEING?

12:22.250 --> 12:25.208
I'M SEEING 2 PEOPLE
WHO DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE HELL THEY WANT

12:25.208 --> 12:26.417
AND I'M SICK OF IT.

12:34.708 --> 12:36.333
SO IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
I CAN GET FOR YOU?

12:36.333 --> 12:38.125
HEAT.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.500
I BEG YOUR PARDON?

12:39.500 --> 12:41.250
IT'S FREEZING
IN HERE.

12:41.250 --> 12:43.083
[SIGHS]

12:43.083 --> 12:47.583
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
WE'RE AN ENVIRONMENTALLY
FRIENDLY INN.

12:47.583 --> 12:50.125
WE LIKE TO CONSERVE
OUR NATURAL RESOURCES.

12:50.125 --> 12:52.250
NOT TO MENTION SAVE
ON OUR ENERGY BILLS.

12:52.250 --> 12:55.041
WHAT?

12:55.041 --> 12:57.208
NO ENSUITE COMMODE?

12:57.208 --> 12:59.750
EXCUSE ME?

12:59.750 --> 13:04.917
WHERE IS THE BATHROOM?

13:04.917 --> 13:07.542
OH. JUST DOWN THE HALL.

13:07.542 --> 13:09.917
IT'S--IT'S COMMUNAL.

13:09.917 --> 13:10.583
I SEE.

13:10.583 --> 13:13.291
WELL, ENJOY YOUR STAY.

13:13.291 --> 13:15.750
UM, WE SERVE
HIGH TEA AT 5:00,

13:15.750 --> 13:18.875
AND BREAKFAST
TOMORROW MORNING,
STARTING AT 7:00.

13:18.875 --> 13:20.625
ENJOY YOUR STAY.

13:20.625 --> 13:22.750
YOU SAID THAT
ALREADY.

13:26.959 --> 13:29.667
YOU'RE RIGHT. I DID.
MY MISTAKE.

13:35.291 --> 13:38.667
OH, MAN. IS IT JUST ME
OR IS IT COLD IN HERE?

13:38.667 --> 13:41.458
SO YOU THINK WE CAN
SUCCESSFULLY IMPERSONATE

13:41.458 --> 13:42.792
BROTHER AND SISTER
THIS WEEKEND?

13:42.792 --> 13:45.291
[SIGHS]
I DON'T SEE WHY NOT.

13:45.291 --> 13:47.583
I TELL YOU, JACK,
I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU DO IT.

13:47.583 --> 13:49.291
I CAN NEVER GET
A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP

13:49.291 --> 13:50.625
IF I'M NOT
IN MY OWN BED.

13:50.625 --> 13:53.083
OH, GOD. ANDIE,
LISTEN TO ME.

13:53.083 --> 13:54.834
I GET THE MESSAGE, OK?

13:54.834 --> 13:56.667
DAD WANTS ME
TO MOVE BACK HOME,
THAT'S FINE.

13:56.667 --> 13:58.834
BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO SPEND THE NEXT
COUPLE OF DAYS

13:58.834 --> 14:00.625
WAGING A SUBTLE CAMPAIGN
TO WEAR ME DOWN.

14:00.625 --> 14:02.000
WHO, ME?

14:02.000 --> 14:03.500
I'M SERIOUS.

14:03.500 --> 14:06.208
ANY MENTION OF HOME,
HOUSE--ANY KIND OF DWELLING
WHERE PEOPLE LIVE,

14:06.208 --> 14:08.125
I'M GONNA GO STAY
IN JEN'S ROOM,
YOU UNDERSTAND?

14:12.041 --> 14:15.500
DOES IT LOOK
LIKE HE'S HAVING
A GOOD TIME?

14:15.500 --> 14:17.792
DOES A LEMON EVER
LOOK LIKE IT'S HAVING
A GOOD TIME?

14:17.792 --> 14:19.041
[LAUGHS]
BE NICE, JOEY.

14:19.041 --> 14:20.000
HE'S JUST DOING
HIS JOB.

14:20.000 --> 14:20.708
ON WHICH RESTS
OUR ENTIRE FUTURE.

14:20.708 --> 14:22.667
WHERE'S PACEY
ANYWAY?

14:22.667 --> 14:24.125
HE SAID HE'D HELP ME
TURN DOWN THE BEDS.

14:24.125 --> 14:25.959
HE'S IN THE BATHROOM
COUNTING ANIMALS 2 BY 2.

14:25.959 --> 14:27.166
WHY? WHAT HAPPENED?

14:27.166 --> 14:29.542
WHAT ELSE? A FLOOD.
THE TOILET OVERFLOWED.

14:32.667 --> 14:36.083
NOTE TO SELF--
CAREER OPTIONS, DELETE
HOTEL MANAGEMENT.

14:51.041 --> 14:52.250
YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:52.250 --> 14:56.125
I DIDN'T ASK HER HERE
FOR JUST ANY REASON.

14:56.125 --> 14:59.041
YOUR MOTHER AND I
HAVE ENOUGH OF
THE SAME FRIENDS

14:59.041 --> 15:00.041
FOR ME TO KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON
IN HER LIFE,

15:00.041 --> 15:03.208
AND SHE IS HITTING
A WALL, DAWSON.

15:03.208 --> 15:06.708
EVERY NETWORK LARGE
AND SMALL, IT SEEMS,

15:06.708 --> 15:10.625
IS PASSING HER BY
FOR A JOB.

15:10.625 --> 15:11.875
SHE NEVER TOLD ME THAT.

15:11.875 --> 15:13.500
WELL,
SHE DIDN'T TELL ME.

15:13.500 --> 15:16.375
WELL, NO OFFENSE, DAD,
BUT I'M HER SON, YOU'RE
HER DIVORCED HUSBAND.

15:16.375 --> 15:17.875
I'M HER FRIEND.

15:17.875 --> 15:20.291
AND I WANT HER TO KNOW,
WHATEVER OUR HISTORY,

15:20.291 --> 15:21.917
THAT I AM THERE FOR HER.

15:21.917 --> 15:23.750
I'M SORRY IF THAT
THREATENS YOU.

15:23.750 --> 15:25.708
IT DOESN'T THREATEN ME.

15:25.708 --> 15:26.750
WELL, IT DOES
SOMETHING.

15:26.750 --> 15:27.959
YEAH, IT PISSES ME OFF.

15:27.959 --> 15:29.083
IT PISSES YOU OFF
THAT YOUR PARENTS
HAVE

15:29.083 --> 15:32.458
A CORDIAL,
POST-DIVORCE
RELATIONSHIP?

15:32.458 --> 15:36.000
NO, IT PISSES ME OFF
THAT--I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO BELIEVE ANYMORE, OK?

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
YOU GUYS--YOU'RE MARRIED,
YOU'RE DIVORCED,

15:38.000 --> 15:39.708
YOU'RE ENEMIES,
YOU'RE FRIENDS, WHAT?

15:39.708 --> 15:41.792
WE'RE TRYING VERY HARD
TO BE FRIENDS RIGHT NOW.

15:41.792 --> 15:42.917
WELL, IT'S A LITTLE LATE
FOR THAT, DON'T YOU THINK?

15:42.917 --> 15:46.166
NO, NO, NO, THAT'S
WHERE YOU'RE WRONG.

15:46.166 --> 15:46.917
THERE'S
NO TIME CONSTRAINT
ON HOW LONG

15:46.917 --> 15:48.917
YOU CAN CARE
ABOUT SOMEONE.

15:48.917 --> 15:50.417
NO LIMIT
ON HOW MUCH.

15:50.417 --> 15:53.083
ESPECIALLY IF THEY'VE
BEEN SO MUCH A PART
OF YOUR LIFE ALREADY.

15:58.166 --> 16:01.458
THIS IS OUR FIRST
FULL WEEK OF
OPERATION, FRED.

16:01.458 --> 16:03.333
SO WE'RE STILL
TRYING TO WORK OUT
ALL THE KINKS.

16:03.333 --> 16:04.667
I THINK OUR FAMILY
STYLE APPROACH

16:04.667 --> 16:06.166
IS WHAT SETS US
APART FROM OUR
COMPETITION, FRED.

16:08.291 --> 16:10.542
Pacey: BATHROOM'S
ALMOST FIXED.

16:10.542 --> 16:12.542
WE HAVE GREAT PEOPLE
WORKING FOR US.

16:12.542 --> 16:14.000
FRED, HAVE YOU MET
OUR ON-SITE HANDYMAN
PACEY WITTER?

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
NO, I HAVEN'T HAD
THE PLEASURE.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.542
REST ASSURED, FOLKS,
I HAVE EVERYTHING
UNDER CONTROL NOW.

16:20.542 --> 16:21.583
TAKEN CARE OF.

16:21.583 --> 16:22.959
[BOOM]

16:28.333 --> 16:32.375
YOU MIGHT WANT TO HAVE
HANDYMAN WITTER
CHECK THE FURNACE.

16:46.083 --> 16:47.041
HEY, WE'RE IN LUCK.

16:47.041 --> 16:48.500
FRICKE WENT INTO TOWN
TO GRAB DINNER.

16:48.500 --> 16:50.000
SHOOT!

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
I DON'T THINK SWEARING
AT THE THING IS GONNA HELP.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.250
OH, AND FLIRTING
WITH IT MIGHT?

16:53.250 --> 16:54.625
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

16:54.625 --> 16:57.834
NOTHING. I'M JUST
A CHILD, REMEMBER?

16:57.834 --> 16:59.625
I'LL JUST STICK
WITH THE LITTLE THINGS.

16:59.625 --> 17:01.458
LIKE HOW WE'RE GOING TO
PREVENT EVERYONE WE KNOW

17:01.458 --> 17:03.291
FROM FREEZING TO DEATH
ON WHAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE

17:03.291 --> 17:04.750
THE COLDEST NIGHT
OF THE YEAR.

17:04.750 --> 17:06.290
YOU'RE CERTAINLY
BEHAVING LIKE A CHILD.

17:06.290 --> 17:07.625
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?

17:07.625 --> 17:09.000
BESSIE, DO YOU EVEN
REMEMBER WHAT IT'S
LIKE TO BE 16?

17:09.000 --> 17:12.333
OR IS THAT LIKE SOME
FAR-OFF PLANET?

17:12.333 --> 17:15.125
[SIGHS] I REMEMBER.

17:15.125 --> 17:17.500
BECAUSE IT'S LIKE YOU HAVE
ALL THE RESPONSIBILITIES
OF AN ADULT

17:17.500 --> 17:19.875
BUT NONE OF THE AUTHORITY.
YOU CAN'T VOTE,
YOU CAN'T DRINK,

17:19.875 --> 17:22.208
YOU CAN'T MAKE ANY
DEFINITIVE DECISIONS
ABOUT YOUR LIFE.

17:22.208 --> 17:24.916
YOU THINK GETTING OLDER
AUTOMATICALLY GIVES YOU
MORE SAY IN YOUR LIFE?

17:24.916 --> 17:25.916
GET REAL, JOEY.

17:25.916 --> 17:28.040
YOU THINK I WANTED
TO BE STUCK HERE AT 26

17:28.040 --> 17:29.458
TAKING CARE OF 2 KIDS
BY MYSELF?

17:29.458 --> 17:31.083
I GUESS
I MISSED THE PART
WHERE YOU BEGGED

17:31.083 --> 17:32.542
AND PLEADED
WITH BODIE TO STAY.

17:32.542 --> 17:34.125
I ASK HIM TO COME HOME
EVERY CHANCE I GET,

17:34.125 --> 17:35.708
BUT HE KNOWS
WE CAN'T AFFORD IT.

17:35.708 --> 17:38.625
TRUST ME, THIS IS NOT
HOW I PLANNED FOR
MY LIFE TO TURN OUT.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.708
I'M REALLY SORRY
IF ALEXANDER AND I

17:40.708 --> 17:42.125
ARE PUTTING SUCH A CRIMP
IN YOUR LIFESTYLE.

17:42.125 --> 17:44.125
BUT WITH ANY LUCK,
I WON'T BE HERE MUCH
LONGER TO TROUBLE YOU.

17:44.125 --> 17:46.583
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

17:46.583 --> 17:48.792
WELL, IT'S CERTAINLY
WHAT IT SOUNDED LIKE.

17:48.792 --> 17:51.667
YOU KNOW, FOR A GIRL
WHO SUPPOSEDLY WANTS
TO LEAVE CAPESIDE

17:51.667 --> 17:53.125
AS SOON AS SHE CAN,

17:53.125 --> 17:56.542
YOU'RE SURE PUTTING
A HELL OF A LOT OF
EFFORT INTO THIS PLACE.

17:56.542 --> 18:00.250
[LAUGHS] YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:00.250 --> 18:02.291
MAYBE IT'S JUST TIME
I STOPPED.

18:07.750 --> 18:10.250
WHO'S HEAD WAS THAT?

18:10.250 --> 18:12.083
AH, NOT TO WORRY,
COACH.

18:12.083 --> 18:14.208
IF ANYBODY'S HEAD
BELONGS ON
THE CHOPPING BLOCK,

18:14.208 --> 18:15.208
IT'S MINE.

18:15.208 --> 18:16.291
WHAT MAKES YOU
SAY THAT?

18:16.291 --> 18:19.333
WELL, LET ME COUNT
THE WAYS, SHALL WE?

18:19.333 --> 18:22.166
FOR ONE, IT WAS
MY IDEA TO REFURBISH
THE OLD FURNACE

18:22.166 --> 18:23.625
INSTEAD OF JUST
BUYING A NEW ONE.

18:23.625 --> 18:25.083
GUILTY AS CHARGED.

18:25.083 --> 18:27.458
YEAH, AND THIS IS
THE ONE YOU'RE
REALLY GONNA LOVE.

18:27.458 --> 18:29.500
IT WAS MY IDEA
TO BRING HERR FRICKE

18:29.500 --> 18:30.542
DOWN TO OUR
LITTLE WEEKEND
IN THE COUNTRY.

18:30.542 --> 18:31.667
YOU DID?

18:31.667 --> 18:34.625
YES. I DID.

18:34.625 --> 18:35.500
AND LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING,

18:35.500 --> 18:38.417
IT WAS NO EASY FEAT,
EITHER, OK?

18:38.417 --> 18:40.291
I HAD TO PULL OUT
ALL THE STOPS
FOR THAT GUY.

18:40.291 --> 18:42.250
USE ALL MY DAZZLING
PEOPLE SKILLS
AND FOR WHAT?

18:42.250 --> 18:44.875
A COMEDY OF ERRORS
THAT'S PROBABLY
GONNA PUT

18:44.875 --> 18:46.750
THE SISTERS POTTER
IN THE POOR HOUSE.

18:46.750 --> 18:50.166
[LAUGHS] YOU KNOW
WHAT I THINK?

18:50.166 --> 18:54.542
I THINK THAT IF
I WERE JOEY AND BESSIE,

18:54.542 --> 18:56.542
I WOULD CONSIDER MYSELF
VERY LUCKY

18:56.542 --> 18:58.291
TO HAVE YOU IN MY LIFE.

18:58.291 --> 19:00.250
WHY?

19:00.250 --> 19:03.125
EVERYTHING
AND EVERYBODY
THAT I TOUCH,

19:03.125 --> 19:04.708
I SCREW UP,
ALL RIGHT?

19:04.708 --> 19:06.375
YOU'RE AWARE
