00:56.208 --> 00:58.458
In a world where two and two are four -

00:58.583 --> 01:02.416
- Denmark will never
become European champions.

01:08.041 --> 01:14.375
I believe firmly,
that we can win the European Championship in 1992.

01:14.458 --> 01:19.041
I also know what you think.
"It can not be done."

01:20.166 --> 01:25.541
If we do this exactly
by the book, so we shall never win.

01:25.625 --> 01:31.875
But if we come better prepared
than them if we know more than them -

01:31.958 --> 01:35.708
- Then we can beat teams
which on paper is better than us.

01:37.125 --> 01:40.125
I'm tired of losing.

01:40.208 --> 01:44.083
Not because we play bad,
because we do certainly not.

01:44.166 --> 01:50.250
But because we are too naive. We are too
stupid to say it in Danish well.

01:50.333 --> 01:53.291
As a small country
we must do away with one thing:

01:53.375 --> 01:55.833
Will we win or look good?

01:55.916 --> 01:58.208
I'm tired of...

01:58.291 --> 02:00.833
- Richard.
- I am working.

02:00.916 --> 02:04.916
- The children are here now.
- I come up now.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.541
I'm tired of looking good and losing.

02:09.625 --> 02:11.666
How's it.

02:27.416 --> 02:31.708
- Where are they?
- Where they go? They are then released.

02:31.791 --> 02:34.625
- They are gone?
- Yes.

02:34.708 --> 02:40.166
- You've been down there for several hours.
- Have I?

02:40.250 --> 02:43.625
Now you sit down
and go have a cup of coffee.

02:50.250 --> 02:53.500
- It'll go well tomorrow.
- Oh yeah.

03:05.708 --> 03:10.541
So he shoots. Not, he waits.
Michael Laudrup!

03:10.625 --> 03:12.708
This is brilliant!

03:12.791 --> 03:15.750
Elkjær even.

03:16.916 --> 03:21.000
Since the 80s, the Danish national team
been loved worldwide -

03:21.083 --> 03:24.750
- The charming,
unpolished players.

03:25.833 --> 03:28.958
Danish football
international breakthrough.

03:29.041 --> 03:32.250
Led by the best coach
Sepp Piontek -

03:32.333 --> 03:36.833
- We have become known
as the world's best losers.

03:50.041 --> 03:54.000
Piontek stops.
Who will be the new coach?

03:54.083 --> 03:58.666
Sepp himself has pointed to his assistant,
Richard Moller Nielsen.

04:14.875 --> 04:18.541
Richard, you are the right
for the job?

04:18.625 --> 04:20.708
Do you have a minute?

04:20.791 --> 04:25.291
Richard, it is possible for you
to replace a coach like Sepp?

04:32.791 --> 04:36.916
Do not you have one?
They are otherwise good.

04:39.833 --> 04:41.666
Well.

04:43.583 --> 04:45.666
How are you?

04:45.750 --> 04:50.291
Yes, thank you, Frits, it goes very well.
What about you two?

04:50.375 --> 04:55.416
- I'm fucking anyway.
- Do you?

04:55.500 --> 04:59.583
But, yes, Richard.
We are happy that you have come.

04:59.666 --> 05:06.250
Yes, we have to have succeeded Sepp,
and we have considered it thoroughly.

05:06.333 --> 05:11.208
- I have also gone with some thoughts.
- Just a moment.

05:12.208 --> 05:15.833
- We have considered it thoroughly.
- Very carefully.

05:15.916 --> 05:20.583
- It has not been easy.
- No, it heaven knows.

05:20.666 --> 05:24.416
But,
we have reached is that...

05:24.500 --> 05:28.041
That it must be a foreigner.

05:29.500 --> 05:31.833
- An alien?
- Yes.

05:31.916 --> 05:37.083
- Richard, the Danes are so damn...
- Boring.

05:37.166 --> 05:39.833
Dull and unimaginative.

05:39.916 --> 05:46.208
We do think that the credit for our success
attributable to the vision -

05:46.291 --> 05:52.250
- As Sepp came with a foreigner.
The beautiful game we've seen, and...

05:52.333 --> 05:55.708
- The foreign gaze.
- The foreign gaze.

05:55.791 --> 05:59.666
I do not think it is,
because Sepp is a good coach?

05:59.750 --> 06:01.750
- The...
- Also it.

06:01.833 --> 06:05.250
But it is also,
because he is a foreigner.

06:06.583 --> 06:11.083
So we want to thank you
for all the good years.

06:11.166 --> 06:15.583
Yes, we will,
and then we wish you good luck.

06:31.125 --> 06:34.083
Why was not Richard Moller?

06:34.166 --> 06:36.833
We can find better simply.

06:36.916 --> 06:43.708
Richard has led youth national
through the best qualification.

06:43.791 --> 06:49.375
My grandmother could have trained the
team, and they would still have won.

07:09.875 --> 07:13.208
- What are you doing?
- We need new kitchen.

07:14.833 --> 07:19.208
- What?
- Now we have had the kitchen for 25 years.

07:19.291 --> 07:21.833
It will be good.

07:21.916 --> 07:26.666
They may not be familiar.
And what he said about his grandmother!

07:26.750 --> 07:30.000
I can not speak
about her qualifications.

07:30.083 --> 07:35.333
It is possible that she is a brilliant
coach, but now we have the kitchen.

07:35.416 --> 07:40.875
- We could get some craftsmen.
- What do you say? No thank you.

07:40.958 --> 07:45.625
- It takes 100 years with them.
- Maybe it's faster.

07:47.791 --> 07:51.083
- We need a list.
- Look here.

07:51.166 --> 07:54.541
It says you fit it all.

07:54.625 --> 08:00.916
... Horst Wohlers as new national coach.
They had not cleared the contract...

08:01.000 --> 08:05.125
- I just need to...
- Frits Ahlstrøm what has gone wrong?

08:05.208 --> 08:10.916
We must admit that it is
a little unfortunate what happened.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.375
- Will Horst Wohlers coach?
- No he does not.

08:15.458 --> 08:19.000
There are only three weeks
to the next match.

08:19.083 --> 08:24.083
That's right.
We are working around the clock at the moment.

08:24.166 --> 08:29.333
At one point, Richard Moller Nielsen
favorite. Is he a topic?

08:29.416 --> 08:36.457
Richard is an experienced coach.
He is in our thoughts.

08:36.541 --> 08:41.916
You say no if they ask.
Do you hear? You say no.

08:42.000 --> 08:47.041
They should not think that they can say no
and then come running and get you.

08:47.125 --> 08:51.375
- You also said no the first time.
- I am serious. They can not do.

08:51.458 --> 08:54.166
You do not take it.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.791
No, no, of course not.

09:29.083 --> 09:34.541
- Going on vacation, Hans?
- I have resigned.

09:34.625 --> 09:37.583
I can not vouch for DBU.

09:37.666 --> 09:40.125
Why do it then?

09:42.916 --> 09:46.833
- It's going to go wrong.
- DBU think obviously at me.

09:46.916 --> 09:52.458
Seven coaches were offered your job.
So much believe DBU you.

09:52.541 --> 09:54.708
Did your grandmother no?

09:54.791 --> 10:00.208
Richard.
You're probably a good coach -

10:00.291 --> 10:05.583
- But the players will be him,
who washed their underpants.

10:08.916 --> 10:14.083
Our pool consists of Yugoslavia
Northern Ireland, Austria and the Faroe Islands.

10:14.166 --> 10:21.000
There is only one country that qualifies
themselves. We go for first place.

10:21.083 --> 10:24.875
The question is whether Richard
can get the stars to align.

10:24.958 --> 10:31.083
You know him as assistant.
Can he win their respect?

10:31.166 --> 10:36.291
I'm very excited about it.
It is world-class players -

10:36.375 --> 10:40.375
- Who are used to having the freedom
to unfold.

10:51.208 --> 10:53.958
Sauna Party!

10:59.166 --> 11:00.791
Well, boys...

11:03.458 --> 11:05.791
Is the welcoming committee?

11:18.958 --> 11:21.250
Here you go! There it is.

11:28.458 --> 11:30.958
Here you go! There it is.

11:39.500 --> 11:43.083
Here you go! There it is.

11:43.166 --> 11:48.875
The first goal ever from a Faroese
team in an international tournament.

11:48.958 --> 11:52.791
The question is whether the 22...

11:52.875 --> 11:54.750
Come on in.

11:54.833 --> 12:00.791
I can not make up my mind whether we
to play with three in the back four.

12:00.875 --> 12:04.333
- The Faroe Islands.
- I side with the three.

12:04.416 --> 12:09.458
But one thing is quite clear:
There will be changes.

12:09.541 --> 12:13.750
We have for many dribbler.
We have lots to improvise.

12:13.833 --> 12:17.250
We have too few,
that can follow a presentation.

12:17.333 --> 12:21.916
They get first task. I do not care
with whether they have nice hair.

12:23.500 --> 12:27.625
Richard. It may take some time
to incorporate a new system.

12:27.708 --> 12:30.625
That's fine.
We have all day tomorrow.

12:33.583 --> 12:36.958
Forward and press! Come home!

12:40.291 --> 12:44.916
- It's your husband that.
- Keep the lines.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.916
- Genpres.
- It is well!

12:48.000 --> 12:51.458
Michael. Michael.

12:51.541 --> 12:54.750
Keep your selections.

12:54.833 --> 12:57.750
Brian, back!

12:57.833 --> 13:01.375
Brian! With back!
Come back!

13:01.458 --> 13:06.791
It is impossible, when they do,
what I say.

13:06.875 --> 13:10.958
Keep your...
Keep your selections!

13:12.875 --> 13:17.083
Michael Laudrup think
situation wait too long.

13:17.166 --> 13:22.416
It certainly does not resemble top football,
what we are witnessing at the moment.

13:22.500 --> 13:26.291
Loose games. The pace is not high enough.

13:26.375 --> 13:29.958
Michael Laudrup.
Is Brian with?

13:30.041 --> 13:34.000
Play the ball and do not
harder than it is.

13:34.083 --> 13:36.125
Nothing will succeed.

13:36.208 --> 13:40.583
What happens to the players?
How is it to be in the situation -

13:40.666 --> 13:45.416
- When one knows that one is
a better team and the better players?

13:45.500 --> 13:47.333
Embarrassing.

13:47.416 --> 13:50.125
It's all over.

13:50.208 --> 13:55.166
Deservedly, it must be said, but also
disappointing for Richard Moller Nielsen.

13:57.541 --> 14:03.291
All along, out. Michael
and Brian, I will be just a moment.

14:12.625 --> 14:15.958
Do you understand what I'm trying
to do about this team?

14:16.041 --> 14:18.291
- Oh.
- Oh.

14:18.375 --> 14:20.708
No?

14:20.791 --> 14:25.000
If we are to win this pool
we need to play more disciplined.

14:25.083 --> 14:29.375
- It seems a bit primitive.
- Primitive?

14:29.458 --> 14:33.666
Yes, we are doing nothing
than running around. What's the point?

14:33.750 --> 14:38.000
If we do not play football that is
worth looking at, why do it?

14:38.083 --> 14:41.291
We might as well
Curling so.

14:41.375 --> 14:46.916
I do not mind curling.
In Canada they call it chess on ice.

14:47.000 --> 14:51.041
We played with stones,
was found in the river.

14:51.125 --> 14:57.208
They were angular. It was random,
where the stone landed.

14:57.291 --> 15:02.208
- I understand...
- Later start to grind them.

15:02.291 --> 15:06.208
One special make them,
so the game was the same for everyone.

15:06.291 --> 15:10.208
You did better cost,
and it is played on hold.

15:10.291 --> 15:14.416
It is one of the best and most
sophisticated team play available.

15:14.500 --> 15:18.583
There are strategy, precision,
cooperation.

15:18.666 --> 15:24.166
There is discipline.
There is no other way, the game can operate on.

15:24.250 --> 15:26.166
Richard!

15:26.250 --> 15:30.166
I can not play your system.
I will not play your system.

15:30.250 --> 15:34.041
No, we will not play your system.

15:40.916 --> 15:44.208
I'm not him,
who washes your clothes.

15:44.291 --> 15:49.500
I am the coach of the Danish national team,
and I play my system -

15:49.583 --> 15:53.458
- Otherwise you will be replaced
with some that do it. That's the way it is.

15:58.583 --> 16:01.416
Remember to throw your clothes for washing.

16:11.458 --> 16:15.333
- It's something terrible mess.
- Michael! Michael!

16:17.541 --> 16:20.333
Michael, work any more!

16:20.416 --> 16:25.000
It seems that the frustrations
which has been up for the match...

16:25.083 --> 16:29.625
- Tempo!
- The spilling over into the game.

16:29.708 --> 16:34.958
It's Brian Laudrup, who is
taken out in favor of Lars Elstrup.

16:35.041 --> 16:38.125
Tempo!
Keep selection.

16:38.208 --> 16:41.041
No one can find out where they are.

16:41.125 --> 16:46.166
They are good players.
They show it's just not in the moment.

16:46.250 --> 16:50.458
I think it's Michael Laudrup,
are taken out.

16:50.541 --> 16:54.250
Brothers Laudrup ends on the bench.

16:54.333 --> 16:56.541
Quite unusual.

16:56.625 --> 17:01.291
One is tempted to believe
Richard will lead by example.

17:01.375 --> 17:06.540
The problem is that this
is a battle we must win -

17:06.625 --> 17:09.250
- To advance to the finals.

17:10.290 --> 17:14.208
Of course it's disappointing.

17:14.290 --> 17:17.915
- It's good.
- It is strong.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.458
- This is good for the potato salad.
- Looking you straight?

17:21.540 --> 17:24.958
It is one Jonna made.
Damn.

17:25.040 --> 17:28.375
- I think it's too late.
- No no.

17:28.458 --> 17:32.625
There are flames.

17:32.708 --> 17:38.208
- Is it one that you have bent?
- The home bent.

17:51.208 --> 17:54.791
The ladies are crazy,
when you stare at football.

17:54.875 --> 17:57.333
I wanted to see what it says.

17:57.416 --> 17:59.583
- What does it say?
- 2-1.

17:59.666 --> 18:03.458
Michael Laudrup, why do you
taken this decision?

18:03.541 --> 18:06.416
I play football for two reasons.

18:06.500 --> 18:11.875
For my sporting ambitions
and for my pleasure in the game.

18:11.958 --> 18:17.208
Neither do I settled at
to play on the Danish national team.

18:18.541 --> 18:21.541
- Are we off?
- No no.

18:21.625 --> 18:25.708
I will not play for the national team,
as long as Richard is the coach.

18:25.791 --> 18:29.625
I have no
no respect for him.

18:46.750 --> 18:49.375
What has gone wrong?

18:49.458 --> 18:53.250
It has not been for Richard
to get the team to function.

18:53.333 --> 18:58.541
Players respect him.
Danes respects him.

18:58.625 --> 19:03.333
A poll shows that 58%
want Morten Olsen as coach -

19:03.416 --> 19:10.291
- 35% would like Sepp Piontek back
and only 5% prefers Richard.

19:10.375 --> 19:13.375
Requirement for Richard is quite clear:

19:13.458 --> 19:19.458
Denmark to qualify, otherwise
may be time to slough off.

19:19.541 --> 19:24.833
And here sounds the whistle
for the last time.

19:24.916 --> 19:31.583
Yugoslavs have qualified for
finals in Sweden next summer.

19:31.666 --> 19:36.500
We can note
that Denmark is out of EM context.

20:09.625 --> 20:13.083
Come on, everybody.
Well fought.

20:13.166 --> 20:16.958
We could not have done more.
That's the way it is.

20:22.500 --> 20:27.083
Piontek! Piontek!
Piontek!

20:27.166 --> 20:31.708
Piontek! Piontek!
Piontek!

20:36.125 --> 20:40.375
We have not qualified us
so what's going to happen now?

20:40.458 --> 20:46.625
There is no doubt that Richard
Moller is finished as a coach.

20:54.958 --> 20:59.291
In him! Tackle!

20:59.375 --> 21:03.541
- We're on the same team.
- You're too slow.

21:03.625 --> 21:05.708
Yes! Such!

21:05.791 --> 21:08.666
- Where were you?
- Come on.

21:09.625 --> 21:13.333
- Oh, father! Fouls!
- Nothing. It's a challenge.

21:15.125 --> 21:19.166
So he pulls into the lane -

21:19.250 --> 21:23.000
- And scores... with the left leg.

21:25.916 --> 21:31.625
- I'll sort out the window.
- Yes. You gotta come and see something.

21:33.916 --> 21:36.416
Games just ahead.

21:38.083 --> 21:43.375
... And therefore taken the step
a blockade against Yugoslavia.

21:43.458 --> 21:49.500
The resolution excludes the country
from participating in sporting events.

21:49.583 --> 21:53.916
- Serbs in Denmark rages over the UN.
- Are you the right?

21:54.000 --> 21:57.125
... They have unfairly
condemned their homeland.

21:57.208 --> 22:02.541
The sanctions hit the football team, which
were ordered to leave Sweden.

22:05.583 --> 22:07.583
This is for you.

22:14.833 --> 22:17.958
- This is Richard.
- It's Frits. Watching TV?

22:18.041 --> 22:21.833
Dav, Frits.
It's all wrong.

22:21.916 --> 22:25.250
We are invited to EM
instead of Yugoslavia.

22:25.333 --> 22:29.833
But Richard,
can reach to get ready in ten days?

22:31.125 --> 22:33.500
You know, Frits?

22:33.583 --> 22:37.416
I have prepared for this for two years.
It can swear I can.

22:37.500 --> 22:42.416
- Do we have a team?
- It'll be a team.

22:48.958 --> 22:53.166
- What did Frits?
- Frits, he said that the...

22:53.250 --> 22:56.750
The kitchen comes enough
to wait a little bit.

23:00.541 --> 23:04.541
After the news that Denmark
still be going to the European Championships -

23:04.625 --> 23:08.083
- Richard will publish
names of the players -

23:08.166 --> 23:11.541
- Be quiet
in training camp tomorrow.

23:15.250 --> 23:16.708
Anette.

23:21.208 --> 23:22.625
Anette!

23:24.708 --> 23:27.833
DBU has published EM group.

23:27.916 --> 23:31.541
Peter Schmeichel, Manchester United.

23:36.416 --> 23:41.375
Lars Elstrup, OB.
Kim Christofte, Brondby.

23:45.125 --> 23:49.041
- How would you assess the chances?
- Microscopic.

23:49.125 --> 23:55.500
Many have gone on vacation. It has not
the punch as 80s team.

23:55.583 --> 24:01.500
Michael Laudrup has stated
that he is not available.

24:01.583 --> 24:05.083
There will be lacking
personalities and people -

24:05.166 --> 24:08.041
- Who can win and surprise.

24:25.250 --> 24:29.625
A moment.

24:29.708 --> 24:33.666
The numbers look good.
Currently, the infection is gone.

24:33.750 --> 24:36.333
Thank you.

25:07.166 --> 25:09.625
Line...

25:12.500 --> 25:17.041
- Hello.
- Hi Dad. Hi Mom.

25:17.125 --> 25:19.083
Hi, honey.

25:20.958 --> 25:25.166
Line, we have just talked to the doctor.
We have good news.

25:25.250 --> 25:29.291
- Can I come home?
- Soon.

25:29.375 --> 25:34.500
- It looks really, really good.
- Am I not sick anymore?

25:34.583 --> 25:40.416
- The infection is completely gone.
- So that's good.

25:40.500 --> 25:44.583
- Good.
- It's really good.

25:46.458 --> 25:52.416
We have to say good luck to Dad.
He needs to Sweden and play now.

25:56.208 --> 25:58.583
When will you be home?

25:59.958 --> 26:02.291
We have to play three matches.

26:04.291 --> 26:07.666
- Line?
- Yes.

26:07.750 --> 26:12.333
- I need to ask you something.
- What is it?

26:13.791 --> 26:16.041
This nose, right?

26:16.125 --> 26:19.625
It's a little too big
to play football with.

26:21.666 --> 26:25.000
- Can you hold it for me?
- Have you cleaned it?

26:25.083 --> 26:29.000
Yes, it is completely fine.
Amager.

26:29.083 --> 26:31.916
Will do.

26:33.458 --> 26:36.041
It's good, honey.

27:07.500 --> 27:11.333
I stand at the Hotel Marina.
After the sudden call -

27:11.416 --> 27:15.208
- Arrive Danish players
to the training camp.

27:15.291 --> 27:21.666
The Danish boys have only
a few days to get ready.

27:21.750 --> 27:25.375
Here arrives one of the players.
It's Brian.

27:25.458 --> 27:30.208
You have previously refused to play
during Richard. What has changed?

27:30.291 --> 27:34.125
I miss playing in the national team,
and then rang Richard.

27:34.208 --> 27:38.083
- Have you had spoken out?
- We have wiped the slate clean.

27:38.166 --> 27:42.750
- When playing his shape?
- I have no more comments.

27:42.833 --> 27:44.666
No press.

27:51.041 --> 27:55.750
Where the hell are they all gone?
I figured some journalists.

27:55.833 --> 27:58.291
I do not understand.

27:58.375 --> 28:02.208
Not, Anette, open the door.

28:02.291 --> 28:06.666
Open the door or roll down the window.
I can not hear what you say.

28:06.750 --> 28:09.375
Open the door.
What?

28:09.458 --> 28:12.666
You had promised me
we were going on vacation.

28:12.750 --> 28:15.291
- Should we take it now?
- Right now!

28:15.375 --> 28:20.166
- We go on holiday afterward...
- It starts the season after all!

28:20.250 --> 28:23.958
I play like a dream,
and as a smoker I to Real Madrid.

28:24.041 --> 28:27.791
- So we are on vacation every day.
- Real Madrid, you?

28:27.875 --> 28:32.791
We are out of the tournament before
ten days. We play hell.

28:32.875 --> 28:37.791
Why do not you stick
an ambition for more than three seconds?

28:37.875 --> 28:40.291
Now I take even the bag...

28:40.375 --> 28:43.875
- Ow! Okay sorry! Anette.
- We had a deal.

28:43.958 --> 28:50.625
Beautiful. You look beautiful when you
is acidic. I do not quarrel now.

28:50.708 --> 28:54.583
- There comes Schmeichel.
- I do not care Schmeichel.

28:54.666 --> 28:58.625
I do not care
with Peter Schmeichel!

29:01.291 --> 29:03.958
I am just two.

29:21.666 --> 29:24.250
Where are the rest?

29:24.333 --> 29:29.875
All from the Super League to play
battle. They are raised for their clubs.

29:29.958 --> 29:35.125
- Are you kidding me, Kay?
- They could not reach to move the matches.

29:35.208 --> 29:40.791
Out of ten preparation days I
without two-thirds in three days.

29:40.875 --> 29:44.000
Was it approved by DBU?

29:47.583 --> 29:50.958
It has a new president.
Him who was DBU before.

29:53.416 --> 29:57.041
I can not help you, Richard.
It must be planned.

29:57.125 --> 29:59.916
We did not know we were going to the European Championships.

30:00.000 --> 30:05.375
- You rag tag qualifying.
- I have seven days to prepare.

30:05.458 --> 30:09.708
You're going to lose three games,
and then you can keep the summer holidays again.

30:09.791 --> 30:14.666
- There must be something you can do.
- There is a lot I can do.

30:14.750 --> 30:18.833
- I'm not going to do it.
- Why not?

30:18.916 --> 30:23.416
Because you're a bonderøv, boring,
and because I do not like you.

30:23.500 --> 30:25.958
Greet the camp.

30:39.375 --> 30:41.875
- Four against four.
- We are only seven.

30:41.958 --> 30:45.583
Yes. I play with.

30:45.666 --> 30:49.250
I will not be
on hold with you, Richard.

30:55.708 --> 30:59.416
Brian, Brian!

30:59.500 --> 31:03.125
- Do not dribble something more?
- I will try.

31:03.208 --> 31:06.541
- Do not get your brother again?
- It does not.

31:06.625 --> 31:10.541
- Why do we play so boring?
- Yes, I do not know.

31:10.625 --> 31:15.500
- It may be that we get a point.
- Me too!

31:15.583 --> 31:19.000
Must For over and watch the games or what?

31:22.833 --> 31:26.625
- What the hell? Should we stay here?
- Seriously?

31:32.583 --> 31:38.291
- I can not Ricardo.
- Morten Olsen would be better.

31:48.125 --> 31:51.625
Hello and welcome, everyone.

31:52.625 --> 31:57.375
My mother
she had a giant cross.

32:02.250 --> 32:07.375
It had some stiffer. They were
pulled out when it should be washed.

32:07.458 --> 32:11.541
When it happened,
then fell all the corset together.

32:11.625 --> 32:17.333
If we compare the
with the national team -

32:17.416 --> 32:21.916
- We have on the team also some
struts that hold it all up.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.583
It's players like Kim Vilfort -

32:25.666 --> 32:30.166
- And it's players
as John 'Faxe' Jensen...

32:30.250 --> 32:32.916
He calls us corset stays.

32:33.000 --> 32:37.541
We are not as damn stiffer
in his mother's cross.

32:37.625 --> 32:41.875
Ville, have you read this?
Ville? Have you read?

32:41.958 --> 32:45.750
- What is it?
- They give us all characters.

32:45.833 --> 32:48.666
- I get the lowest.
- They write so much.

32:48.750 --> 32:53.916
I'm not the worst.
What the hell is this writing?

32:54.000 --> 32:57.833
- Writes the that you are the worst?
- Yes.

32:57.916 --> 33:02.625
- The very worst?
- Yes.

33:02.708 --> 33:06.708
The newspaper says that you are
the very worst of this team...

33:06.791 --> 33:10.000
Shut up!
I've had a shit season.

33:10.083 --> 33:13.291
You're damn too, John.
Oh yeah.

33:13.375 --> 33:18.500
I'm too selfless. So I run
around like a mouse in a china shop.

33:18.583 --> 33:23.875
- Dog.
- I have to play my own chance.

33:23.958 --> 33:28.583
- Take it to Richard.
- I have to make some goals.

33:28.666 --> 33:32.125
Then they build them
somewhat larger, John.

33:46.041 --> 33:51.375
How are things at home
with Line and such?

33:51.458 --> 33:53.375
It's going well.

33:53.458 --> 33:59.375
They are very positive about
it all. Chemo works.

33:59.458 --> 34:02.583
I'm damn glad to hear.

34:04.958 --> 34:07.541
She's a little fighter.

34:08.916 --> 34:13.250
Right now my biggest problem,
you think that you have to make goals.

34:17.250 --> 34:20.583
So is the European Championships finals started.

34:20.666 --> 34:24.791
Denmark is pooled with France,
Sweden and England.

34:24.875 --> 34:27.166
Today it is England.

34:31.041 --> 34:32.958
John Jensen.

34:33.750 --> 34:39.375
Wee far outside
but a shot from John Jensen -

34:39.458 --> 34:43.375
- Which just made one single goal
in his career. Laudrup...

34:43.458 --> 34:45.916
There is not any over there.

34:46.000 --> 34:51.291
The players have no confidence.
They do not believe 100% in it yet.

34:54.625 --> 34:58.375
We throw too many balls away
too quickly.

35:02.833 --> 35:06.208
Our players try
greasing through.

35:06.291 --> 35:11.208
They can then be much more than this.
They can try more.

35:11.291 --> 35:16.333
We can hope that a sixpence-Chinese
also can give a twitch.

35:16.416 --> 35:21.791
It is a drowsy place.
Let us after all call it football.

35:23.250 --> 35:27.083
We have everything to gain,
so why not give 100%?

35:27.166 --> 35:32.250
That's the advice I would give
If I was the coach.

35:32.333 --> 35:38.958
END signal from John Blankenstein.
0-0 in Denmark's opening game.

35:39.041 --> 35:42.916
Two rest days to the Danish players
before they meet Sweden.

35:50.125 --> 35:54.666
- What they write?
- Bananas.

35:54.750 --> 35:59.291
They have asked the Swedish coach,
what his secret is. Bananas.

35:59.375 --> 36:03.708
- It must be good with carbohydrates.
- It should he be allowed to think.

36:03.791 --> 36:06.583
Brian seems a bit unfocused.

36:06.666 --> 36:10.958
Talk to him.
Try to motivate him a little more.

36:11.041 --> 36:14.916
- What I've never understood.
- What?

36:15.000 --> 36:19.166
- That you have to motivate the players.
- Give them a little more zest.

36:19.250 --> 36:25.541
They must play for 40,000 people.
They will represent their country.

36:25.625 --> 36:32.041
So do you want me to give
them clergy and motivate them.

36:32.125 --> 36:33.916
It's just...

36:34.000 --> 36:38.250
Yes, if it was me...
It is of course not.

36:38.333 --> 36:41.375
I do not understand it.

36:41.458 --> 36:45.875
I got two caps and
were the two best days of my life.

36:45.958 --> 36:48.833
Yes, yes, of course.

36:51.333 --> 36:54.958
It may be
that you should talk to Brian yet.

37:08.666 --> 37:13.083
- Oh, damn, man!
- It's your selection, it is!

37:13.166 --> 37:16.916
Where the hell are you from?
Up the pace, right?

37:20.166 --> 37:24.166
Come on, Brian!
Come home.

37:31.458 --> 37:34.916
Let's swap
on Christofte and Andersen. Brian?

37:41.000 --> 37:44.041
This is fine otherwise.

37:44.125 --> 37:47.750
We are probably gone a bit awry
each other, but...

37:47.833 --> 37:50.500
I need...

37:50.583 --> 37:54.416
I need,
that you are 100% sharp against Sweden.

37:54.500 --> 37:58.291
- Do not you think I'm sharp?
- It's not what I mean.

37:58.375 --> 38:03.791
- I do not understand what you want.
- Keep the selections we agreed.

38:03.875 --> 38:07.125
I want you to help the others.

38:07.208 --> 38:09.666
It's random where you run.

38:09.750 --> 38:13.625
We are eleven man out.
It's not just about you.

38:18.125 --> 38:20.166
So...

38:20.250 --> 38:24.791
Yes, but... So I have to go out
and run some more.

38:32.625 --> 38:37.458
Sweden is at home.
27,000 Swedes.

38:37.541 --> 38:42.291
The point is semifinal places.

38:42.375 --> 38:46.791
Should it come true
then two points tonight.

38:47.500 --> 38:52.666
It is managed Swedes
to shield Brian Laudrup from.

38:52.750 --> 38:55.500
Kent Nielsen is in the middle.

38:55.583 --> 39:00.333
Fortunately averted, but the ball
is in the net. Brolin has scored.

39:07.083 --> 39:10.000
It is with the will...

39:10.083 --> 39:13.583
Denmark can not get on
in the finals.

39:13.666 --> 39:18.416
It may be a fact now.
The Swedes have defeated us 1-0.

39:18.500 --> 39:25.708
Goodbye to Denmark in the tournament.
And goodbye here from Råsunda.

39:48.250 --> 39:51.708
- What cries over?
- We are out of the European Championship.

39:51.791 --> 39:55.791
- you are not out.
- They have just said. We are out.

39:55.875 --> 39:59.041
- We are not looking.
- Why say it?

39:59.125 --> 40:03.208
- We can not win over France.
- If we win, we move on?

40:03.291 --> 40:06.333
England must not win
Sweden.

40:06.416 --> 40:10.000
If we beat France,
we are not on?

40:10.083 --> 40:13.083
Sweden should preferably
win over England.

40:13.166 --> 40:18.916
We must win by two goals. If the
play 1-1, then are drawn.

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
If you play a draw
we are on.

40:22.083 --> 40:24.583
Kaj, you lost me.

40:24.666 --> 40:28.166
I'm not sure
that it is true.

40:28.250 --> 40:32.250
But if we win,
then we have a chance.

40:33.625 --> 40:37.250
Kaj, is Richard fired?

40:38.375 --> 40:42.583
Richard is a much better coach,
than anyone understood.

40:42.666 --> 40:46.250
He is the most intelligent coach.

40:46.333 --> 40:50.833
He is the most dedicated
and the best prepared.

40:50.916 --> 40:54.958
He sees things that Sepp never
would have ever discovered.

40:56.083 --> 41:00.333
There is no one who understands
what he says.

41:00.416 --> 41:03.625
There is no one who understands
what he means.

41:03.708 --> 41:06.750
If someone will try
to understand him...

41:06.833 --> 41:09.416
Will he be fired?

41:10.791 --> 41:13.416
Yes.

41:13.500 --> 41:16.166
He gets fired.

41:40.083 --> 41:42.708
Hey, boss?

41:42.791 --> 41:48.083
Chief, should not we at McDonald's?
I could eat a cheeseburger.

41:48.166 --> 41:50.916
- I'm just saying.
- You can get a banana.

41:54.250 --> 41:58.125
- Can we get a banana down here?
- Stupid Pier.

42:16.791 --> 42:22.000
It is John.
Hello, Minna.

42:22.083 --> 42:25.166
Yes, yes.
Course.

42:25.250 --> 42:29.541
Kim, it's Minna phone.
Germ?

42:39.375 --> 42:43.541
Hi, honey.
I was right and snuggled with Faxe.

42:43.625 --> 42:46.291
You know how it is...

42:48.750 --> 42:51.625
Honey, calm down.

42:53.666 --> 42:57.000
That can not be, right?

42:57.083 --> 43:01.500
Honey, it can not be.
They said the numbers look good.

43:03.625 --> 43:06.666
Minna, it must be a mistake.

43:09.333 --> 43:11.750
What are they saying?

43:18.083 --> 43:21.541
Honey, I come home immediately.

44:06.916 --> 44:10.000
If anything,
I can do, so...

44:40.583 --> 44:42.666
Come in.

44:44.416 --> 44:48.541
Kim. I would like just to have
your opinion about it here.

44:48.625 --> 44:52.083
Ham Papin we should have turned.

44:52.166 --> 44:55.083
He must not
get some space at all.

44:55.166 --> 44:58.791
Richard, I travel.

44:58.875 --> 45:04.333
This is my daughter. She had...
She's had it...

45:04.416 --> 45:08.958
The medicine does not do what it should,
so I'm going home.

45:12.958 --> 45:14.625
Well...

45:14.708 --> 45:18.500
When are you going,
that you can be back?

45:18.583 --> 45:24.625
- I do not think I'll be back.
- No. No, of course not.

45:28.625 --> 45:32.541
You know what? I'll call you,
when we have beaten France.

45:32.625 --> 45:35.250
Yes.

45:35.333 --> 45:40.375
- I'm sorry.
- Do not think more about.

45:40.458 --> 45:44.875
It's just football
it all, right?

45:44.958 --> 45:47.166
Yes.

47:17.583 --> 47:22.625
He took the ferry this morning.
We must make do with one man less.

47:23.875 --> 47:27.166
There's still a struggle
against France.

47:27.250 --> 47:33.458
I think we should give it a roach
and pick up where we left off yesterday.

47:46.708 --> 47:50.583
- What they write about us?
- Not something you want to know.

47:50.666 --> 47:54.708
Because it has been in the paper,
it may well be true.

47:54.791 --> 47:58.333
They write that we do not have
a chance against France.

47:58.416 --> 48:01.875
I need to keep the newspaper.
Anything else?

48:01.958 --> 48:07.708
If we do not win, it
your last game as coach.

48:07.791 --> 48:11.208
Yes, they probably are right.

48:13.958 --> 48:18.250
- Are we so poor, Wharf?
- I think not.

48:18.333 --> 48:20.583
What then?

48:23.416 --> 48:28.833
It will not greater than the lawn.
The first time you score on his father.

48:28.916 --> 48:33.125
The totally pure happiness.

48:33.208 --> 48:35.958
Although he made a score on purpose.

48:36.041 --> 48:39.208
My dad did not let me score
intentionally.

48:39.291 --> 48:43.500
Then, the higher the webs.
You get shoes with studs on.

48:43.583 --> 48:49.375
There are people looking on.
You start getting money for it.

48:49.458 --> 48:52.666
But it is still
the same feeling we were chasing.

48:52.750 --> 48:56.125
The feeling from the lawn,
as it was six years.

48:56.208 --> 49:00.375
What is it that you sit and talk nonsense about?

49:00.458 --> 49:04.125
We have forgotten
why we are here, Richard.

49:04.208 --> 49:08.291
We have forgotten that we are here,
because we love football.

49:09.541 --> 49:14.500
You're a really good coach.
And I believe you.

49:15.791 --> 49:19.041
But you're a lousy leader.

49:21.041 --> 49:25.958
You have a lot of good players with you
here to Sweden.

49:26.041 --> 49:29.458
You do not have a team yet.

49:49.541 --> 49:53.250
Ingmar, stop the bus.
Yes, stop here.

49:59.958 --> 50:03.083
No, afternoon training is canceled.

50:03.166 --> 50:05.750
We need to find the winner -

50:05.833 --> 50:10.541
- A cheese... so generously donated
of our sponsors.

50:10.625 --> 50:12.833
We have to play miniature golf.

50:12.916 --> 50:15.833
- Mini Golf?
- Yes.

50:15.916 --> 50:21.541
- How about miniature golf?
- What kind of cheese?

50:21.625 --> 50:24.125
We need to find out.

50:34.291 --> 50:36.666
I have a children's wand.

50:45.291 --> 50:48.083
Hear how to win a cheese.

50:48.166 --> 50:52.666
In 1960, Denmark qualified
to the semifinals at the Olympics.

50:52.750 --> 50:55.416
Denmark going ahead 1-0 -

50:55.500 --> 50:58.583
- When Hungary suddenly
get a penalty.

50:58.666 --> 51:01.166
Henry From we at goal.

51:01.250 --> 51:05.458
Pál Várhidi from Hungary should kick.
He goes up to the ball.

51:05.541 --> 51:09.541
Just before he was about to kick,
Henry goes out to the right post -

51:09.625 --> 51:12.833
- Takes his gum out...

51:12.916 --> 51:15.625
... And put it on the post.

51:17.291 --> 51:21.541
Várhidi is completely psyket out.
He has no idea what is going on.

51:21.625 --> 51:24.708
He got off...

51:28.083 --> 51:30.500
... And burns.

51:32.791 --> 51:36.708
- The coolest wins the cheese.
- Where is my Havarti, Richard?

51:39.958 --> 51:44.958
Here it is make or break for both
Danes and the French.

51:45.041 --> 51:48.291
Cantona in the air...
Henrik Larsen comes!

51:48.375 --> 51:49.583
Yep!

51:50.958 --> 51:55.500
Henrik Larsen after seven minutes!

51:55.583 --> 52:00.583
Denmark ahead 1-0.
A terrific start.

52:00.666 --> 52:04.666
A semi-final place
is within reach.

52:04.750 --> 52:07.958
Good start for the Danish team.

52:08.041 --> 52:11.416
We win everything,
what can be won by the melee.

52:11.500 --> 52:15.333
Uplifting first half.
An impressive achievement.

52:15.416 --> 52:19.166
- Yes, go with it.
- Laudrup...

52:20.666 --> 52:23.958
Cantona...
Papin is not offside.

52:28.750 --> 52:31.416
It's so undeserved.

52:31.500 --> 52:35.958
- Larsen, it's you.
- Brian Laudrup be out.

52:39.416 --> 52:42.708
Richard, if we do not get a goal,
it's over.

52:42.791 --> 52:46.166
You're right, but he is tired.
Lars entering.

52:46.250 --> 52:49.500
And into must Lars Elstrup.

52:49.583 --> 52:55.625
It must be a clear attempt
to bet anything, you can say that.

52:56.791 --> 53:00.375
There should be only one goal for
to win semi-final place.

53:00.458 --> 53:02.291
Elstrup.

53:02.375 --> 53:03.958
Sivebak.

53:04.041 --> 53:08.083
And there is no offside on
Flemming Povlsen. It is still alive.

53:13.666 --> 53:17.666
Lars Elstrup have done it!
Wonderful!

53:17.750 --> 53:23.416
At this time Denmark
in the semifinals 2-1.

53:23.500 --> 53:28.500
Danish football is in the semifinals
at this European Championship!

53:28.583 --> 53:33.625
This simply tells,
that everything can be done.

53:33.708 --> 53:37.375
Father? If you are not on the national team more?

53:37.458 --> 53:40.208
Yes, I am then.

53:40.291 --> 53:44.041
Why did you play so not?

53:44.125 --> 53:48.333
- Because I'm with you.
- Then I can not see you play.

53:48.416 --> 53:53.875
- It's just football, baby.
- At this time is here still.

53:53.958 --> 53:57.208
Now, all saying,
that my father is tough.

53:57.291 --> 54:01.708
Do they say that? It knew
you know that I was already.

54:01.791 --> 54:05.083
I have said
that you could not.

54:06.208 --> 54:11.333
What do you have? You know what? that you shall not say to me!

54:11.416 --> 54:13.625
- Apologize.
- No.

54:13.708 --> 54:18.750
- Then you say that I am tough.
- You're cool.

54:18.833 --> 54:21.625
Okay, that's good.

54:23.000 --> 54:26.583
I think you have to play with
in the next match.

54:31.958 --> 54:37.250
Then you take it here and take care of it.
Do you promise?

54:40.958 --> 54:44.583
I love it.

54:44.666 --> 54:48.125
- Amager behead.
- Well.

54:59.458 --> 55:02.000
They are tired.

55:02.083 --> 55:06.833
I did not think they were in the form of
three games. Now we are at number four.

55:06.916 --> 55:11.333
- Maybe we should relax the accelerator.
- We can do after the final.

55:11.416 --> 55:15.250
Come on! Can I see some movement!

55:15.333 --> 55:18.625
Be ready to receive.
You look like a couple of old ladies!

55:20.458 --> 55:23.125
Good words again, but...

55:26.541 --> 55:31.541
What are you standing there staring for?
Fire up them. They are completely from it.

55:41.833 --> 55:47.083
I promised her that we win.
I have fucking play properly.

56:22.375 --> 56:25.833
Chef? Can we not be allowed
to come to McDonald's?

56:25.916 --> 56:29.291
I could eat
on that cheeseburger.

56:55.041 --> 57:01.416
I spoke with Frits last night. DBU
has invited players' wives up.

57:01.500 --> 57:04.875
They will be accommodated
at another hotel.

57:04.958 --> 57:08.000
If we win, they can not be.

57:08.083 --> 57:12.875
It's nowhere to be found a single
hotel in the days leading up to the final.

57:12.958 --> 57:16.083
DBU had not anticipated
that we came so far.

57:16.166 --> 57:20.583
There is not anybody who has thought
to book rooms.

57:27.958 --> 57:32.250
Can I just ask
on your attention for a moment?

57:32.333 --> 57:39.250
We all know that the women coming up
to see us play the semifinals.

57:39.333 --> 57:44.208
The live course
at another hotel. Yes, it is.

57:44.291 --> 57:48.083
Now I have spoken with DBU,
and it has become such -

57:48.166 --> 57:52.958
- That when we win the semi-final and
to stay here a couple of extra days -

57:53.041 --> 57:56.666
- Then wives and pendants come
stay at our hotel.

58:00.166 --> 58:02.541
Yes, sleep in your room.

58:12.625 --> 58:15.708
Is not this what you meant?

58:24.500 --> 58:30.166
The Danish team has arrived
to Gothenburg, where to play.

58:30.250 --> 58:33.333
What is needed,
for Denmark to win?

58:33.416 --> 58:38.750
Richard to get his star players
to play up to their best.

58:38.833 --> 58:41.583
It is he not succeed yet.

58:57.500 --> 59:01.416
Brian Laudrup... He can.
But not this time.

59:02.625 --> 59:04.583
He lacks the latter.

59:30.833 --> 59:35.750
It seems specious out,
but does not really matter.

59:49.083 --> 59:53.916
Brian Laudrup little too hesitant.
Brian Laudrup... Sivebak.

59:54.000 --> 59:55.708
Not that way.

59:59.708 --> 01:00:04.500
See . Away and thanks for today,
and then comes Amoros' challenge.

01:00:04.583 --> 01:00:07.083
Brian Laudrup!

01:00:07.166 --> 01:00:10.458
- Henrik Larsen and Brian Laudrup.
- Naughty Games!

01:01:25.166 --> 01:01:27.833
Brian... Brian.

01:01:34.875 --> 01:01:40.375
I need to find this out.
You know, I like to take notes.

01:01:40.458 --> 01:01:43.458
I have made some calculations.

01:01:44.625 --> 01:01:50.416
Since I was nine, and I played truant from
Sunday school to see OB play -

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:54.500
- Which I have seen at least
of three games a week every week.

01:01:54.583 --> 01:01:58.083
I am 55 years. Minus 9 is 46.

01:01:58.166 --> 01:02:03.625
It is 2,392 weeks
with three games a week.

01:02:03.708 --> 01:02:09.833
And of course it's alive.
Football should not be seen on television.

01:02:09.916 --> 01:02:15.083
It provides 7176 matches. It is
than 600,000 minutes of football -

01:02:15.166 --> 01:02:18.458
- I have seen in my life.

01:02:18.541 --> 01:02:21.375
Plus added.

01:02:21.458 --> 01:02:26.250
You can hear that it has been
for some hours during the year.

01:02:26.333 --> 01:02:30.041
Still, I am not afraid
to say -

01:02:30.125 --> 01:02:33.125
- That you are the best I have seen.

01:02:34.625 --> 01:02:39.458
You're better than your brother.
You are 100% the best football player.

01:02:39.541 --> 01:02:42.916
I thought
that it was right to take you out -

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.541
- Because you were tired,
and it was best for the team.

01:02:47.625 --> 01:02:52.208
I can not promise that you will always
is the first on the team sheet.

01:02:52.291 --> 01:02:58.958
But if you are not, then ensure
I help you get to know why.

01:03:00.708 --> 01:03:06.666
I want you to play
the semifinal exactly as you feel.

01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:10.583
Today you must keep completely free.
Is that clear?

01:03:17.958 --> 01:03:20.041
Off you go.

01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:36.916
We sit and pinching each other
arms.

01:03:37.958 --> 01:03:42.208
They do not check it, the Dutch.
They are appalled at the moment.

01:03:42.291 --> 01:03:47.958
One of the key points must stand out for
our number 11, Brian Laudrup.

01:03:48.041 --> 01:03:51.166
He has played
a very big first half.

01:03:55.666 --> 01:03:57.541
Laudrup.

01:03:59.416 --> 01:04:02.541
It is a player
which can constrict the largest.

01:04:04.458 --> 01:04:08.041
There is only one question:
Turns forces to?

01:04:13.416 --> 01:04:18.541
- Should not I?
- No not yet.

01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:28.750
So it is now.

01:04:28.833 --> 01:04:33.750
After the completion
comes the Danish replacement.

01:04:33.833 --> 01:04:40.333
It is a limping Brian Laudrup, who
after a great effort off the field.

01:04:40.416 --> 01:04:44.875
They have been hard on him,
but he has driven endless games with them.

01:04:44.958 --> 01:04:47.375
Continued Danish goals. 2-1.

01:04:47.458 --> 01:04:53.791
Henrik Andersen and Sivebæk has laced
the Dutch players inside.

01:04:57.666 --> 01:04:59.708
It does not look good.

01:05:02.916 --> 01:05:05.291
Hey!
We need help!

01:05:10.958 --> 01:05:15.291
Try to see
Henrik Andersen left leg.

01:05:20.041 --> 01:05:22.583
Henrik Andersen finished.

01:05:25.250 --> 01:05:31.416
A dull sentence.
He has played an awesome tournament.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.250
It may be 20 minutes long.

01:05:41.333 --> 01:05:42.666
Come on!

01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:46.500
- They come closer.
- It is critical minutes.

01:05:46.583 --> 01:05:50.291
The Danish team has problems
with the pace.

01:05:50.375 --> 01:05:52.125
Out of the box!

01:05:52.208 --> 01:05:55.750
They throw everything into
in the Danish penalty area.

01:05:55.833 --> 01:06:01.208
No, no, no, no!
Oh no! It is a lie.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.125
With just four minutes left.

01:06:07.208 --> 01:06:11.166
Four minutes
from a Danish finals.

01:06:14.250 --> 01:06:20.000
But here it all
settled with penalties.

01:06:30.583 --> 01:06:35.166
It was well fought, everyone.
We will not turn out.

01:06:35.250 --> 01:06:38.791
We have a finale, we have to play.

01:06:38.875 --> 01:06:41.916
The five, who must kick...

01:06:46.041 --> 01:06:49.416
The first: Great.

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:52.541
Number two: Flemming.

01:06:55.458 --> 01:06:59.041
Number three: Elstrup.

01:07:00.666 --> 01:07:05.166
Do not ask me
how it feels to be down there.

01:07:06.375 --> 01:07:09.750
Number four: Vilfort.

01:07:13.375 --> 01:07:16.875
Number five...

01:07:16.958 --> 01:07:18.916
Christofte.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:26.291
It all must be initiated by the expert
in dead-ball situations. Ronald Koeman.

01:07:28.083 --> 01:07:33.833
Ronald Koeman from FC Barcelona
to Peter Schmeichel.

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:42.625
Scary.

01:07:42.708 --> 01:07:46.083
So it's Henrik Larsen
with tired, heavy legs.

01:07:46.166 --> 01:07:49.625
Breukelen is inside
and play some psychological.

01:07:52.416 --> 01:07:57.125
He has fingers.
Both top of that. Both hands.

01:07:57.208 --> 01:08:02.500
Next man is Marco van Basten.
He used to be safe for Milan.

01:08:04.791 --> 01:08:07.750
But it is not a normal match,
it here.

01:08:08.625 --> 01:08:13.625
Schmeichel stop it!
Hello, Peter Schmeichel!

01:08:13.708 --> 01:08:16.791
Face of one of the world's best.

01:08:18.291 --> 01:08:26.125
It's Flemming Povlsen's trip. Again
Breukelen along and run psychological.

01:08:26.207 --> 01:08:31.375
- This referee must stop.
- Now he will be stepping into.

01:08:31.457 --> 01:08:34.082
Let's cross our fingers for Flemming.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.832
Certainly!
He did quite brilliantly.

01:08:49.791 --> 01:08:51.750
Kim Vilfort.

01:08:53.832 --> 01:08:56.166
Yes! Well, Vilfort!

01:08:56.250 --> 01:08:59.707
So it's over,
if the Dutch burner now.

01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:06.500
And Witschge get settled.

01:09:09.416 --> 01:09:15.750
So it lies with Kim Christofte,
as last penalty shot.

01:09:17.250 --> 01:09:21.957
Whew, Kim Christofte! An incredibly
pressure, lying on his shoulders now.

01:09:22.041 --> 01:09:26.082
If Christofte scores,
then Denmark in the European Championship final.

01:09:48.666 --> 01:09:51.250
Kim Christofte.

01:09:53.082 --> 01:09:58.458
- He just put it right.
- He can not get enough voltage.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:37.666
Yes! Bumbummelum!
Denmark in the European Championship final in 1992!

01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:46.208
Danish football's biggest night.
We are in the European Championship final for the first time.

01:10:55.625 --> 01:11:00.916
Oh yes! Estimates Virgo in the night. May I
not sleep with beautiful maiden in the night?

01:11:02.666 --> 01:11:06.583
- How's Henry?
- Mogens is with him.

01:11:06.666 --> 01:11:10.833
He's not going to play
very long time.

01:11:10.916 --> 01:11:14.291
Henrik and Turbo are out.
Kent has a fiber in the calf.

01:11:14.375 --> 01:11:19.041
Siv has a thigh,
Faxe and Store has groin problems.

01:11:19.125 --> 01:11:24.208
Lars has hip problems, Christ Often
and Brian hematoma.

01:11:24.291 --> 01:11:27.041
- No good news?
- Yes Yes.

01:11:27.125 --> 01:11:31.958
If we play with two goalkeepers, so
we can put 11 man on Friday.

01:12:17.625 --> 01:12:22.541
Here the next day we are few,
which must eat our words to us again.

01:12:22.625 --> 01:12:27.916
Denmark is in its first final
at an ever finals.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:32.416
- Have we done Richard Moller clock?
- We underestimated the team.

01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:35.083
It was a very impressive performance.

01:12:35.166 --> 01:12:39.333
What is it, Richard does
which gets the team to flourish?

01:12:39.416 --> 01:12:45.916
I do not know if it's something
he has done. They do what they want.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:51.083
You take responsibility for yourself.
Which is what we have been calling for.

01:12:51.166 --> 01:12:55.916
Richard Moller has always stood for
a very controlled style of play -

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.458
- And, as we saw yesterday,
was something else entirely.

01:12:59.541 --> 01:13:01.791
- Richard.
- You see TV?

01:13:01.875 --> 01:13:04.250
It runs in the background.

01:13:05.583 --> 01:13:08.583
They will never
to like you.

01:13:12.541 --> 01:13:16.000
They had to admit
that they have been wrong.

01:13:16.083 --> 01:13:19.625
This is in spite of Richard Moller,
that the team function.

01:13:20.958 --> 01:13:23.875
The Richard I know, do not care.

01:13:23.958 --> 01:13:28.666
The Richard I know
river the whole kitchen down -

01:13:28.750 --> 01:13:31.916
- And so he smokes up the sleeves.
Stubbornness.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.583
Hard work and a little charm.
How did you get me.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:42.875
- Was that it?
- But make sure you win on Friday.

01:13:56.333 --> 01:14:01.166
- Kent, how's the knee?
- It goes well.

01:14:01.250 --> 01:14:05.375
- We press today.
- Yes, I think you are right.

01:14:05.458 --> 01:14:09.458
- Good fight.
- Good fight, my friend.

01:14:26.625 --> 01:14:29.666
Manager, before you say anything, so...

01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:35.583
I've shot a lot of goals,
and I did not hit so much -

01:14:35.666 --> 01:14:38.416
- Or not hit anything at all.

01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:41.875
I'll be
a strut from now on.

01:14:41.958 --> 01:14:46.000
- Be quiet and listen to me.
- Yes.

01:14:46.083 --> 01:14:49.416
- You can not be the same as Brian.
- No.

01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:52.250
You are not as fast
as Sivebak.

01:14:52.333 --> 01:14:57.250
You do not have the same view,
as Christofte has.

01:14:57.333 --> 01:15:04.958
But you're my engineer. You are
the one that gets the others to act.

01:15:05.041 --> 01:15:10.583
You run and run like no other.
You run and you never give up.

01:15:10.666 --> 01:15:15.708
If I want another player
I would have taken another.

01:15:15.791 --> 01:15:19.208
If the ball comes to you,
and it is true -

01:15:19.291 --> 01:15:23.000
- So I demand
you to give it a kick in the ass.

01:15:23.083 --> 01:15:27.958
But look as hell at
the laces when you kick it.

01:15:33.666 --> 01:15:35.958
- Not?
- Jo.

01:15:38.625 --> 01:15:42.958
- Sateme well kicked.
- I also believe my knee was dislocated.

01:15:47.041 --> 01:15:49.791
Welcome to Gothenburg.

01:15:49.875 --> 01:15:53.375
- Welcome to the final.
- Who is European Champion?

01:15:53.458 --> 01:15:58.208
World champions Germany
or the big surprise Denmark?

01:15:58.291 --> 01:16:01.750
Adventure team that does not even
qualified for the European Championship.

01:16:01.833 --> 01:16:05.625
Even without their biggest star,
Michael Laudrup, they are in the final.

01:16:05.708 --> 01:16:07.333
The Germans are favorites.

01:16:07.416 --> 01:16:12.250
The Danes had a tough semifinal,
where they suffered several injuries.

01:16:12.333 --> 01:16:15.583
Germany is just a better team.

01:16:19.041 --> 01:16:23.500
Richard, this is it.

01:16:23.583 --> 01:16:25.833
I'm on the way.

01:16:41.375 --> 01:16:46.708
The players have made it great.
Much nicer than hoped.

01:16:46.791 --> 01:16:51.000
But you can not compare it
with the 80-team...

01:16:51.083 --> 01:16:55.875
- Turn off the bras.
- It had style and charisma...

01:16:55.958 --> 01:17:00.291
80s, are past.

01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:05.333
And they will not come back.

01:17:05.416 --> 01:17:07.958
Preben Elkjær, he's not here.

01:17:08.041 --> 01:17:13.166
Frank Arnesen is here either.
Michael Laudrup is here either.

01:17:13.250 --> 01:17:18.250
While they were here in their best
age, they would smoke on the bench.

01:17:18.333 --> 01:17:21.458
I have exactly the team
I want.

01:17:21.541 --> 01:17:24.291
They're all together in this room.

01:17:24.375 --> 01:17:29.666
If I win today,
finals here today -

01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:32.750
- It's you,
is the golden age of the team.

01:17:32.833 --> 01:17:37.083
Those journalists...
Do not listen to them.

01:17:37.166 --> 01:17:39.791
There are small dogs and large dogs.

01:17:39.875 --> 01:17:43.125
Small dogs do.
Large dogs do not bark.

01:17:43.208 --> 01:17:46.416
- And we are...
- are the big dogs!

01:17:48.625 --> 01:17:54.666
So you have heard me talk about tactics
and strategy and run patterns.

01:17:54.750 --> 01:18:01.708
I have heard me talk about genpres
and indications and contraindications.

01:18:01.791 --> 01:18:06.791
The thing is, of course still.
There is one thing I want to ask you:

01:18:06.875 --> 01:18:08.625
Forget it all.

01:18:11.791 --> 01:18:15.458
In the system can.
I know where to place you.

01:18:15.541 --> 01:18:17.791
Know whom to select.

01:18:17.875 --> 01:18:24.041
It sits in mind.
I know exactly what it is about.

01:18:25.083 --> 01:18:28.541
I ask only one thing today:

01:18:29.791 --> 01:18:32.583
It is letting go.

01:18:32.666 --> 01:18:37.375
But give everything I have in you.

01:18:37.458 --> 01:18:43.291
So I promise that tomorrow I wake up
and European champions.

01:18:48.958 --> 01:18:52.125
Let's get out and give them
a good skull.

01:18:52.208 --> 01:18:57.041
There is a lovely country

01:18:57.125 --> 01:19:02.625
It stands with broad beeches

01:19:02.708 --> 01:19:06.333
Near the salty eastern beach

01:19:06.416 --> 01:19:12.541
Near the salty eastern beach.

01:19:13.916 --> 01:19:19.208
It meanders in hill and dale

01:19:19.291 --> 01:19:24.250
It is called old Denmark

01:19:24.333 --> 01:19:29.416
And it is Freja floor

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:34.333
And it is Freja floor.

01:19:38.958 --> 01:19:41.833
Danes attacking from the right.

01:19:41.916 --> 01:19:45.875
It is clear
that the Germans have learned from the battle -

01:19:45.958 --> 01:19:49.916
- Danes played against Holland.
They have dense markings.

01:19:50.666 --> 01:19:54.583
Must work hard.
The Germans now come with full steam.

01:19:54.666 --> 01:19:56.541
Come on! Up the tempo!

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:05.416
You can really see
that the Germans have closed everything totally off.

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:10.208
Major problems for the Danish team
in the first 17 minutes.

01:20:16.458 --> 01:20:19.125
Vilfort to Brehme.

01:20:25.208 --> 01:20:27.416
Continued Flemming Povlsen.

01:21:01.833 --> 01:21:07.166
At the bottom of the pile: John 'Faxe' Jensen!
Well, well, well.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:18.750
The Germans now come with full steam.
Klinsmann... Ending!

01:21:18.833 --> 01:21:23.041
Great rescue
Peter Schmeichel! Still the Germans.

01:21:23.750 --> 01:21:27.333
Schmeichel with one hand.
No, it is quite impossible.

01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:30.833
Klinsmann.

01:21:30.916 --> 01:21:35.125
Kent Nielsen is in the middle.
It was unbelievable!

01:21:35.208 --> 01:21:39.458
After a fading start, I think,
they have found their marks.

01:21:40.416 --> 01:21:42.833
Large German option.

01:21:43.958 --> 01:21:47.916
Schmeichel!
Thank you!

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.125
It's a little too close to
for my taste.

01:21:53.083 --> 01:21:55.625
Sivebak. Vilfort.

01:21:55.708 --> 01:21:58.791
So make Brehme foul on Vilfort.

01:22:00.833 --> 01:22:04.958
Vilfort is down. Vilfort had
tremendous impact on this team.

01:22:05.041 --> 01:22:09.250
He has been outstanding
both in defense and attack.

01:22:09.333 --> 01:22:11.666
Sad if it ends here.

01:22:18.416 --> 01:22:21.791
And Vilfort has cleared.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.375
Flemming Povlsen bears.

01:22:43.833 --> 01:22:46.375
Vilfort.

01:22:53.125 --> 01:22:55.250
Still Vilfort.

01:22:56.541 --> 01:22:58.250
Vilfort yet!

01:23:03.708 --> 01:23:06.666
And there, Kim Vilfort!

01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:11.750
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Huttelihut!

01:23:15.041 --> 01:23:18.041
It was Dad!

01:23:30.625 --> 01:23:34.958
It's a lie, man!
Denmark ahead 2-0.

01:23:40.541 --> 01:23:43.875
I just have to keep
for 14 minutes yet.

01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:49.666
I had ten nails when I came.
I have therefore not many left.

01:23:51.333 --> 01:23:54.541
- Nine minutes.
- Is there really such a long time?

01:23:54.625 --> 01:23:57.000
Five minutes left.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:03.083
- It will last all the way.
- One minute remaining.

01:24:03.166 --> 01:24:05.041
60 seconds long.

01:24:12.416 --> 01:24:16.125
It's over! They have done it!

01:24:16.208 --> 01:24:21.666
The Danish national football team.
Danish football's greatest triumph!

01:24:21.750 --> 01:24:24.166
2-0 over world champions.

01:24:24.250 --> 01:24:28.625
How it looks
when you are well.

01:24:34.541 --> 01:24:38.500
You did it.
You crazy man.

01:25:04.041 --> 01:25:08.375
Light, bright colors, red and white.
Large Danish triumph.

01:25:08.458 --> 01:25:11.958
Congratulations, Denmark.
And with these glorious pictures -

01:25:12.041 --> 01:25:16.958
- We only wish here
all of you a really good party.

01:26:23.291 --> 01:26:25.875
Hey, there he is!

01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:33.208
Boss, boss, boss, boss...

01:26:34.958 --> 01:26:40.750
Pantwater! Pantwater!
Pantwater!

01:26:45.416 --> 01:26:47.875
He's one of our own

01:26:47.958 --> 01:26:50.625
For he's a jolly good fellow

01:26:50.708 --> 01:26:57.250
For he's a jolly good fellow,
a real baggy.

01:26:57.333 --> 01:27:02.083
A really baggy,
a really baggy

01:27:02.166 --> 01:27:06.375
For he's a jolly good fellow

01:27:06.458 --> 01:27:07.598
A real baggy.
