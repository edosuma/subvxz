00:14.973 --> 00:17.517
-Misato's in the truck in front of us?
-Yeah.

00:20.186 --> 00:22.647
Okay, why don't you drink
some tea to relax.

00:22.731 --> 00:23.565
Thanks.

00:37.454 --> 00:40.749
If you can drive up next to it,
I'll look in and check.

00:41.249 --> 00:43.251
If it's true, then this is serious.

00:43.835 --> 00:45.545
I'm sorry, Mr. Yashiro.

00:45.628 --> 00:48.548
I could just be wasting your time
playing detective.

00:49.299 --> 00:50.633
What do you mean?

00:51.801 --> 00:54.179
We're pretending
there's some kidnapper out there,

00:54.262 --> 00:58.600
so we've been making friends with any girl
we see off by themselves.

00:59.642 --> 01:02.896
It's to prevent any potential kidnappings
from happening.

01:04.480 --> 01:06.649
You're doing the right thing, then.

01:07.442 --> 01:09.027
It's an effective strategy.

01:10.153 --> 01:14.449
But as a result,
I basically used Misato like bait.

01:15.742 --> 01:20.121
Satoru. I've come to really respect
your proactiveness and mentality.

01:21.581 --> 01:24.501
Is that why you've suddenly become
more outgoing?

01:24.584 --> 01:28.421
Yeah, I felt like I wanted
to fill the void inside.

01:29.214 --> 01:31.174
Both in others and myself.

01:33.718 --> 01:35.470
I feel the same way, Satoru.

01:36.012 --> 01:38.389
It's my life philosophy.

01:40.433 --> 01:41.267
<i>Crap.</i>

01:41.935 --> 01:46.189
<i>That's something Yashiro told us in the</i>
<i>first timeline for our graduation.</i>

01:50.485 --> 01:51.319
Hey, Satoru.

01:52.278 --> 01:56.282
There's no need for you to feel
any guilt or shame right now.

01:57.492 --> 02:01.621
The reason people do anything
is to compensate for their own faults.

02:02.497 --> 02:05.125
That goes for both good deeds
and bad deeds.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.293
The motivation is the same.

02:09.086 --> 02:11.381
<i>That's a pretty extreme way of thinking.</i>

02:17.512 --> 02:18.388
I've actually

02:18.888 --> 02:22.892
done a lot of things lately in order
to get closer to a certain person.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.520
Sometimes I'd be direct,

02:26.104 --> 02:28.690
other times I'd use
some really dirty tricks.

02:29.732 --> 02:31.025
It was really fun.

02:33.653 --> 02:35.780
Is it someone you have feelings for?

02:37.323 --> 02:39.742
I suppose you could compare it to romance.

02:40.827 --> 02:43.580
I mean, it's about filling a void
in both cases.

02:48.209 --> 02:49.627
Want me to get you some candy?

02:52.797 --> 02:55.508
Thanks.
But there isn't any candy in there.

02:57.343 --> 03:00.013
SLEEP AID

03:00.096 --> 03:02.682
LAXATIVE

03:03.474 --> 03:04.475
That's because...

03:06.019 --> 03:07.687
this isn't my car.

03:18.364 --> 03:19.198
Don't worry.

03:20.158 --> 03:23.328
Misato isn't in that truck.

03:36.841 --> 03:38.676
YAMOTO FARM

04:03.493 --> 04:06.829
Satoru, do you ever feel
like your happiest moment

04:06.913 --> 04:09.415
is something that gets
constantly renewed?

04:11.626 --> 04:16.005
You know, mine was just renewed today.

05:08.808 --> 05:09.642
Satoru.

05:11.686 --> 05:13.521
You lied to me about one thing.

05:15.648 --> 05:19.569
You were doing everything knowing
there was a kidnapper in this town.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.195
Right?

05:24.115 --> 05:25.783
I didn't want to believe it.

05:26.784 --> 05:29.454
Someone that could anticipate
my every action.

05:30.747 --> 05:31.789
But it was clear.

05:32.915 --> 05:35.460
The day I gave you and your mother a ride

05:35.543 --> 05:38.421
was the day I was going to
put my plan into action.

05:58.357 --> 06:02.153
That was the second time you
stopped a plan of mine after Kayo.

06:02.236 --> 06:05.531
That's when I began to think
it wasn't just a coincidence.

06:05.948 --> 06:08.576
And so I decided to use Misato as bait.

06:09.285 --> 06:13.998
Satoru, if you showed up for Misato,
my suspicion would turn to conviction.

06:15.374 --> 06:16.709
That you were my enemy.

06:24.967 --> 06:26.385
This can't be happening.

06:27.929 --> 06:31.891
This time, all of the pieces fell right
into place, just as I planned.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.354
I gave Misato tea mixed with laxatives.

06:38.731 --> 06:41.526
Koichi! You don't get food if you lose!

06:41.609 --> 06:43.194
<i>I ordered lunches from the Shiratoris.</i>

06:43.277 --> 06:44.112
SHIRATORI FOODS

06:53.037 --> 06:53.871
RESTROOM

06:53.955 --> 06:55.081
EMERGENCY EXIT

07:03.506 --> 07:06.551
-Satoru? What's up? The bathroom's--
-Mr. Yashiro, great timing!

07:06.634 --> 07:08.678
There's something
I have to check right now.

07:12.515 --> 07:13.891
And now you're here.

07:15.393 --> 07:17.603
This is me in my true form.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.318
<i>I'm such an idiot.</i>

07:25.528 --> 07:27.447
<i>I didn't even suspect him at all.</i>

07:28.739 --> 07:30.283
<i>By trusting Yashiro,</i>

07:31.075 --> 07:33.619
<i>I was trying to</i>
<i>eliminate him from suspicion.</i>

07:34.579 --> 07:35.413
<i>But...</i>

07:36.289 --> 07:37.707
<i>the real killer</i>

07:38.583 --> 07:39.876
<i>is the man next to me.</i>

07:40.501 --> 07:41.586
<i>Gaku Yashiro.</i>

07:42.795 --> 07:46.382
Honestly, it was exhilarating
to have my back against the wall.

07:47.341 --> 07:51.220
It's as if you've seen the future.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.332
Satoru.

08:19.999 --> 08:23.336
I had a brother
who was two years older than me.

08:24.629 --> 08:25.963
He was a violent one.

08:26.589 --> 08:28.382
I got punched every day.

08:43.898 --> 08:46.359
It was because both of my parents
doted on me.

08:47.693 --> 08:50.530
Parental neglect
created a void inside him.

08:51.197 --> 08:54.116
And even as a child,
I understood what he was doing

08:54.200 --> 08:55.743
was to try and fill that void.

09:02.833 --> 09:05.795
<i>Eventually, my brother replaced beating me</i>

09:05.878 --> 09:09.090
<i>with sexually molesting young girls.</i>

09:09.173 --> 09:12.176
-There's this really neat book.
-Oh, really?

09:17.056 --> 09:19.058
Make sure you keep watch, Gaku.

09:20.685 --> 09:21.852
-Let's go.
-Okay.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.405
THE SPIDER'S THREAD

09:41.497 --> 09:43.583
<i>Keeping them from talking</i>
<i>was also my job.</i>

09:43.666 --> 09:45.167
Here, this is for you.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.919
<i>I made sure to do a good job.</i>

09:48.337 --> 09:49.630
<i>I did what I had to do.</i>

09:55.803 --> 09:57.888
And when I was in seventh grade,

09:58.639 --> 09:59.599
it happened.

10:25.249 --> 10:28.628
<i>Until then, nobody had ever</i>
<i>come near that building.</i>

10:33.341 --> 10:36.761
<i>If someone got close,</i>
<i>it was also part of my job</i>

10:36.844 --> 10:38.095
<i>to let him know.</i>

10:45.019 --> 10:46.145
Brother?

10:51.734 --> 10:52.568
Brother?! Brother...

11:02.620 --> 11:03.746
Is she...?

11:04.330 --> 11:05.956
I couldn't have her yelling.

11:06.582 --> 11:07.917
I didn't have a choice.

11:11.712 --> 11:12.838
This is your fault!

11:13.297 --> 11:15.758
This happened
because you didn't keep watch!

11:18.886 --> 11:20.846
Come on, help me carry her.

11:25.976 --> 11:26.852
Hurry up!

11:44.161 --> 11:47.665
<i>In that moment,</i>
<i>I realized what I had to do.</i>

11:48.207 --> 11:49.333
<i>I made my decision.</i>

11:49.417 --> 11:51.168
FORENSIC MEDICINE

12:13.816 --> 12:18.070
<i>Having killed a young girl, guilt</i>
<i>tragically drove my brother to suicide.</i>

12:18.821 --> 12:23.325
<i>Police forensics ruled out murder.</i>

12:23.868 --> 12:25.286
<i>The case was closed.</i>

12:29.874 --> 12:31.417
That's when I realized...

12:32.585 --> 12:36.839
that my brother was inside me, too.
And that I was looking to fill my void.

12:38.340 --> 12:40.551
You know full well, don't you, Satoru?

12:41.469 --> 12:44.472
Just what that entails for me.

12:47.308 --> 12:50.186
But now it's game over, Satoru.

12:51.353 --> 12:52.313
For you.

12:53.355 --> 12:54.190
And for me.

13:07.870 --> 13:10.122
Your actions should be commended.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.335
My plan and preparation, too.

13:15.753 --> 13:19.882
We both deserve something
for our hard work.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.137
What you will be getting
is peace for this town.

13:26.263 --> 13:28.098
That's what you wanted, isn't it?

13:32.102 --> 13:34.855
And what I will be getting is a death

13:35.481 --> 13:37.274
by my hands, just for myself.

14:30.119 --> 14:32.288
I've decided to leave this town.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.583
That makes a happy ending for both of us.

14:36.750 --> 14:38.961
Isn't that right, Satoru?

15:22.463 --> 15:23.505
Satoru?!

15:50.866 --> 15:51.700
Kids.

15:52.409 --> 15:54.161
I have some very sad news.

15:57.831 --> 15:58.666
Last night,

15:59.458 --> 16:03.379
a car carrying Satoru Fujinuma
was in an accident.

16:07.257 --> 16:10.386
Satoru is currently in critical condition.

16:11.512 --> 16:13.973
He's being treated in the hospital's ICU.

16:17.059 --> 16:17.893
Everyone,

16:19.019 --> 16:20.813
Satoru is coming back.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.025
Let's all pray...

16:27.111 --> 16:28.654
for his safe recovery.

16:44.545 --> 16:47.381
Why, Satoru?

16:53.262 --> 16:54.179
Why?

16:55.639 --> 16:58.559
MIKOTO ELEMENTARY

17:54.907 --> 17:57.659
Here is your cheeseburger set
and croquette set.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.078
That will be 1100 yen. Out of 2000 yen.

18:01.538 --> 18:03.791
Here is 900 yen in change.
Thank you.

18:06.543 --> 18:07.753
Welcome.

18:10.672 --> 18:11.715
Sawada...

18:27.231 --> 18:29.608
We could've talked back at my place.

18:31.819 --> 18:34.071
I wanted it to be just the two of us.

18:36.532 --> 18:37.449
So, what is it?

18:39.660 --> 18:40.786
Do you feel like...

18:41.829 --> 18:44.123
you're not allowed to enjoy yourself?

18:50.879 --> 18:54.466
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You should go out and have fun.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.097
Do I look that bad?

19:00.597 --> 19:02.266
No, that's not what I meant.

19:04.059 --> 19:05.102
I'm just saying...

19:06.270 --> 19:08.397
you should let loose once in a while.

19:13.694 --> 19:16.655
THE WANDERERS EXHIBIT
UENO ART MUSEUM

19:17.906 --> 19:18.740
It's in Ueno?

19:21.368 --> 19:23.996
Hey. I just want you to remember.

19:25.038 --> 19:28.542
You can actually...
make it to Ueno on one train.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.924
What did he mean by that?

19:40.929 --> 19:41.972
Nothing.

19:46.268 --> 19:49.646
MANABU NISHIZONO

20:07.497 --> 20:10.459
You're the lawyer
Takanari Kobayashi's son,

20:11.084 --> 20:12.169
Kenya, aren't you?

20:15.005 --> 20:16.465
I'm Sawada, a journalist.

20:17.132 --> 20:21.428
When you were in grade school,
I worked for TV Ishikari's News Division.

20:23.430 --> 20:26.558
Then... you know about the incident.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.894
Come to my office with me,

20:29.519 --> 20:30.479
young Kobayashi.

21:01.593 --> 21:06.348
Today... is when the statute
of limitations is up for the case

21:06.431 --> 21:09.643
your father took
involving the murder of the little girl.

21:24.950 --> 21:27.077
We mostly narrowed down the suspects.

21:29.246 --> 21:30.122
But still...

21:31.248 --> 21:33.667
I couldn't find any conclusive evidence.

21:35.877 --> 21:36.753
It's because...

21:40.632 --> 21:41.925
I wasn't good enough.

21:46.888 --> 21:48.849
So, what are you going to do now?

21:51.101 --> 21:52.769
Are you going to give up?

21:54.104 --> 21:56.690
-I can't let things end here.
-In that case...

21:57.983 --> 22:00.694
do you want to find
the real killer with me?

23:01.880 --> 23:02.756
Okay.

23:23.443 --> 23:24.653
I'm home.

23:41.294 --> 23:42.963
It was hot again today, huh?

23:45.173 --> 23:46.007
Satoru.

23:47.305 --> 23:53.490
