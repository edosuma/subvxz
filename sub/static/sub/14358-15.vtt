<i>Valentine's day...</i>

00:06.128 --> 00:08.296
<i>When couples
take one special day</i>

00:08.297 --> 00:10.798
<i>to express their love
for each other.</i>

00:10.799 --> 00:12.567
<i>For couples with kids,</i>

00:12.568 --> 00:15.703
<i>Valentine's day can be a
different story. Happy Valentine's day.</i>

00:15.704 --> 00:17.572
Yep.

00:17.573 --> 00:20.107
<i>And this year
didn't hold the promise</i>

00:20.108 --> 00:22.042
<i>of being any different.</i>

00:22.043 --> 00:24.078
Uh-oh.
Is it Valentine's day?

00:24.079 --> 00:27.114
I owe you flowers. Yeah,
relax. It's not till Saturday.

00:27.115 --> 00:29.584
Help!

00:29.585 --> 00:31.852
Brick forgot
he had to bring valentines

00:31.853 --> 00:34.855
to his social group tomorrow. The odd
squad's celebrating Valentine's day, huh?

00:34.856 --> 00:36.457
That oughta be fun.

00:36.458 --> 00:38.293
<i>Mike.</i>

00:38.294 --> 00:40.328
<i>A few weeks ago,
brick's teacher suggested</i>

00:40.329 --> 00:42.263
<i>he join a group
that helped kids like him</i>

00:42.264 --> 00:43.731
<i>learn better social skills.</i>

00:43.732 --> 00:46.301
<i>I'm not sure
how well it was working.</i>

00:46.302 --> 00:49.304
Do you want to play Ker Plunk?!

00:49.305 --> 00:52.039
No, thanks.

00:52.040 --> 00:54.309
Brick, remember,
we make eye contact

00:54.310 --> 00:56.344
when we're talking to a friend.

00:56.345 --> 00:58.379
Sorry.

00:58.380 --> 01:00.381
No, thanks.

01:01.450 --> 01:03.884
Here we go.

01:03.885 --> 01:05.653
Four perfectly good ones.

01:05.654 --> 01:08.055
Buzz Lightyear,
Powerpuff Girls,

01:08.056 --> 01:10.925
Pretty Pretty Princess
and a dove.

01:10.926 --> 01:12.993
This is a sympathy card.

01:12.994 --> 01:15.630
Well, slap a heart
on the "sorry for your loss,"

01:15.631 --> 01:18.700
and we're good to go. Hey, you
guys got a minute? Excellent.

01:18.701 --> 01:21.035
On "v" day, I'm taking out
this chick Kristen...

01:21.036 --> 01:24.004
A senior, freakishly hot.
Wait, what happened to Kate?

01:24.005 --> 01:26.006
God, we broke up,
like, three months ago.

01:26.007 --> 01:28.275
Read my Facebook status.
Anyway, here's the plan.

01:28.276 --> 01:30.945
I pick her up, I say,
"we're just going for burgers,"

01:30.946 --> 01:32.580
she's a little disappointed,

01:32.581 --> 01:35.583
then I drive past the burger
place to the red lantern,

01:35.584 --> 01:37.452
<i>she's like, "what?"
I'm like, "yeah!"</i>

01:37.453 --> 01:40.020
We get to the table,
a dozen red s, I'm in.

01:40.021 --> 01:42.156
In?
What do you mean, "in"?

01:42.157 --> 01:46.794
You know. I figure $100
will cover it, $120 with gas.

01:46.795 --> 01:48.796
What do you say? Dad?
I say no.

01:48.797 --> 01:50.732
Seriously?!

01:50.733 --> 01:53.501
God, I figured once you heard
how awesome my plan was,

01:53.502 --> 01:55.970
you'd want to donate.
I mean, you were young once,

01:55.971 --> 01:59.807
before you got old and lame, but
whatever. Hi, mr.. And mr... Heck.

01:59.808 --> 02:02.577
<i>In order to understand
our reaction, you need to know</i>

02:02.578 --> 02:04.779
<i>a few weeks ago,
Carly looked like this...</i>

02:04.780 --> 02:07.548
Hi, mr.. And mr... Heck.
Is Sue here?

02:07.549 --> 02:10.116
Notice anything different
about Carly?

02:12.320 --> 02:15.256
Yeah!
She got her braces off.

02:15.257 --> 02:17.792
<i>Yeah. Oh. Yeah,
now that you mention it...</i>

02:17.793 --> 02:20.495
Wow, yeah. I-I-I thought
something was different.

02:20.496 --> 02:22.497
She is so lucky, isn't she?

02:22.498 --> 02:24.866
She got a glow-in-the-dark
retainer and everything.

02:24.867 --> 02:28.002
We're gonna go see if it works.

02:28.003 --> 02:29.504
Whoa.
Yeah.

02:29.505 --> 02:31.972
A hot girl who still thinks
she's a geek.

02:31.973 --> 02:34.809
Some 13-year-old boy
is going to be very lucky.

02:39.114 --> 02:40.782
I want you to know,

02:40.783 --> 02:44.552
Zack has been having so
much fun with brick. Really?

02:44.553 --> 02:46.954
Brick? Brick Heck?

02:46.955 --> 02:48.956
Oh, yeah.
He talks about him all the time.

02:48.957 --> 02:51.459
The thing is,
he was wondering if brick

02:51.460 --> 02:54.395
would like to have a sleepover
at our house this weekend.

02:54.396 --> 02:56.731
A sleepover?

02:56.732 --> 02:59.467
<i>Don't cry. Do not cry.</i>

03:01.169 --> 03:03.471
Zack.
Is that "hands-in-the-pants"

03:03.472 --> 03:06.541
or the one that keeps smelling
his fingers? That's all one kid.

03:06.542 --> 03:09.109
No, Zack is the cat kid, and he's
a total get! The cat is the get?

03:09.110 --> 03:11.345
Oh, yeah. He's the most
popular kid in the group.

03:11.346 --> 03:13.080
Oh, my God.

03:13.081 --> 03:14.682
They'll be best friends,

03:14.683 --> 03:17.184
and maybe they can
room together in college

03:17.185 --> 03:18.886
and then get
an apartment afterwards,

03:18.887 --> 03:21.522
and then he won't come back
and live with us.

03:21.523 --> 03:23.858
He's all set.
Oh, it's all working out.

03:23.859 --> 03:25.326
Worries over.

03:25.327 --> 03:27.194
Easy, girl.

03:27.195 --> 03:30.531
It's a long fall from up there.

03:30.532 --> 03:32.433
So a few days later,

03:32.434 --> 03:34.702
<i>it actually was
Valentine's day.</i>

03:34.703 --> 03:38.172
Whoa!
What are you doing, buddy?

03:38.173 --> 03:40.074
Practicing for my sleepover.

03:40.075 --> 03:42.777
Lookin' good.

03:44.245 --> 03:45.980
Happy Valentine's day.

03:45.981 --> 03:48.549
Squirrel ate half a bird
and left it on the patio.

03:48.550 --> 03:51.218
I'll Chuck it
in the neighbor's yard later.

03:51.219 --> 03:52.920
Hello, everybody.

03:54.000 --> 04:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:04.900 --> 04:08.135
What's with the eyes? You in
a play or something? I'm...

04:08.136 --> 04:10.004
Have plans with Carly tonight,
remember?

04:10.005 --> 04:12.974
Besides, I wear makeup.
I wear makeup all the time.

04:12.975 --> 04:14.842
Eh, I don't think so.

04:14.843 --> 04:18.646
I think I would've remembered
the look. Okay, can you just...

04:18.647 --> 04:20.648
Sue, honey...

04:20.649 --> 04:22.817
I think I know
what the makeup is about.

04:22.818 --> 04:25.520
When I was your age,
I had a friend just like Carly

04:25.521 --> 04:28.389
who, you know,
blossomed before I did

04:28.390 --> 04:30.825
and made me feel
a little self-conscious.

04:30.826 --> 04:33.728
But it'll happen
for you, too. It will.

04:33.729 --> 04:36.130
What, 'cause she got
her braces off faster?

04:36.131 --> 04:38.098
You know,
she only had an overbite.

04:38.099 --> 04:40.801
I had jaw issues
and a tongue thrust.

04:40.802 --> 04:42.904
I don't know what I meant.

04:42.905 --> 04:44.872
Well, if I haven't blossomed,

04:44.873 --> 04:46.941
then why would I have
gotten invited

04:46.942 --> 04:49.343
to the seventh and eighth grade
boy-girl party? Huh?

04:49.344 --> 04:52.112
You were invited to a
boy-girl party? Uh-huh.

04:52.113 --> 04:54.448
By an eighth grader. Eighth grade
he asked Carly to come, h?

04:54.449 --> 04:56.851
And then she asked
if she could bring a friend,

04:56.852 --> 04:59.453
and the guy said yes!
No boy-girl parties.

04:59.454 --> 05:01.388
Mom, that is totally unfair.

05:01.389 --> 05:03.925
We are, like, the only two
people in the class

05:03.926 --> 05:06.761
that haven't been to one yet,
and then all of a sudden,

05:06.762 --> 05:08.529
Carly got invited,
and now this is our chance!

05:08.530 --> 05:11.198
Please, mom! Please. I
didn't say that you couldn't,

05:11.199 --> 05:13.500
but your dad and I
have to discuss it.

05:13.501 --> 05:16.136
No boy-girl parties.
End of discussion.

05:16.137 --> 05:18.472
Axl was going to boy-girl
parties when he was 12!

05:18.473 --> 05:20.775
Yeah, well,
we were bad parents then.

05:20.776 --> 05:23.143
We've learned from our mistakes.
I am growing up.

05:23.144 --> 05:25.212
Why can't you guys
just trust that

05:25.213 --> 05:27.882
the values you've instilled
in me are strong enough

05:27.883 --> 05:29.817
to keep me
from making bad decisions?

05:29.818 --> 05:33.353
Mike, she's in junior hi now.
She's ready.

05:33.354 --> 05:35.056
But I'm not.

05:46.401 --> 05:48.769
<i>And guess
brick was growing up, too.</i>

05:48.770 --> 05:50.771
<i>And I wasn't
leaving anything to chance.</i>

05:50.772 --> 05:52.473
Okay, we've got a book...

05:52.474 --> 05:54.008
Backup book...

05:54.009 --> 05:55.676
Extra book...

05:55.677 --> 05:57.211
Your reading flashlight,

05:57.212 --> 06:01.348
another book and one more book.

06:02.450 --> 06:03.718
Meow!

06:03.719 --> 06:06.053
He's so excited.
Zack, talk like a person.

06:06.054 --> 06:08.756
So is brick.
Brick, put down the book.

06:08.757 --> 06:10.958
I just really hope this works.

06:10.959 --> 06:12.493
Me, too.

06:14.630 --> 06:16.631
Me, too.

06:16.632 --> 06:18.132
Hey, dad.

06:18.133 --> 06:19.667
No money.
Hear me out.

06:19.668 --> 06:22.136
Turns out, Kristen's friends
were dateless on Valentine's...

06:22.137 --> 06:23.904
Don't know why
'cause they're hot...

06:23.905 --> 06:26.674
But she wanted to hang out
as more of a group thing.

06:26.675 --> 06:28.475
Lucky Sean and Darrin
were free,

06:28.476 --> 06:30.845
so the plan now
is to just, you know,

06:30.846 --> 06:33.648
all go out for burgers.
Should still be cool... I think.

06:33.649 --> 06:36.083
$50 to $75
gets you on the ground floor.

06:41.056 --> 06:42.990
Fine.
Have no vision. Whatever.

06:42.991 --> 06:45.359
Ciao, losers!
Night's gonna be awesome.

06:45.360 --> 06:47.762
Hey, Lady Gaga,
love your music.

06:48.997 --> 06:52.800
Oh, hey, Axl.
I was gon...

06:52.801 --> 06:54.501
Carly's mom is outside.

06:54.502 --> 06:57.371
Oh! My first boy-girl party! Ha!

06:57.372 --> 06:59.239
How do I look?

06:59.240 --> 07:00.708
Very pretty.

07:02.443 --> 07:04.779
Be a good girl.

07:04.780 --> 07:05.980
Dad.

07:05.981 --> 07:07.114
Okay, okay.

07:07.115 --> 07:09.283
Have fun.

07:09.284 --> 07:10.617
Bible fun!

07:10.618 --> 07:12.853
God sees everything you do!

07:12.854 --> 07:14.722
Even in the dark!

07:21.429 --> 07:22.830
Wait.

07:24.465 --> 07:26.200
Do you hear that?

07:26.201 --> 07:28.569
That's the sound
of no kids in the house.

07:28.570 --> 07:31.338
Oh, my God, Mike.
We're alone.

07:31.339 --> 07:33.007
On Valentine's day!

07:33.008 --> 07:35.375
We haven't been alone
on Valentine's day

07:35.376 --> 07:38.312
since Axl was born.
What should we do?

07:38.313 --> 07:40.380
No, no, no, wait!
Wait. Don't you see?

07:40.381 --> 07:42.216
We don't have to do it fast
this time.

07:42.217 --> 07:44.618
We could go to dinner,
then come back

07:44.619 --> 07:47.554
and then do that afterwards.

07:47.555 --> 07:48.956
Yeah...

07:48.957 --> 07:52.593
After dinner isn't always
your sexiest time.

07:52.594 --> 07:54.461
Oh, my God,

07:54.462 --> 07:56.063
I'm dying!

07:56.064 --> 07:58.498
Why did you let me order
that mud pie?

07:58.499 --> 08:01.102
And all those breadsticks?
Ugh!

08:01.103 --> 08:04.404
I'm so bloated.
I'm gonna explode.

08:07.109 --> 08:10.211
I'm just saying
maybe we should do it now

08:10.212 --> 08:12.546
while we're still...
Light on our feet.

08:12.547 --> 08:13.814
How about...

08:13.815 --> 08:15.816
We knock one off now,

08:15.817 --> 08:17.618
then have dinner,
then come back

08:17.619 --> 08:20.221
and do it again.
You really up to that?

08:20.222 --> 08:23.023
I don't know,
but I'd sure like to try.

08:23.024 --> 08:25.692
Well, light a candle
and put on the Lionel Richie.

08:25.693 --> 08:27.427
It's go time!

08:29.533 --> 08:31.701
Forget the music.
We got a candle.

08:31.702 --> 08:33.635
Get over here!
Oh, you're right.

08:33.636 --> 08:36.371
Just wanted it to be perfect.

08:36.373 --> 08:38.508
Whoo, baby!
Come on, baby.

08:40.309 --> 08:43.111
Oh, God! Unnatural!
Guys, hide your eyes!

08:43.113 --> 08:46.315
Mr. Heck, Mrs. Heck,
great to see you both.

08:46.316 --> 08:49.785
Hope you're having
a fantastic Valentine's day.

08:49.786 --> 08:52.154
Why are you guys here? Yeah,
what happened to your dates?

08:52.155 --> 08:54.924
It's kind of
hilarious, actually.

08:54.925 --> 08:56.626
So they met these college guys,

08:56.627 --> 08:58.561
but they don't even like 'em,

08:58.562 --> 09:01.463
so these guys are taking 'em out
to a "fancy restaurant,"

09:01.464 --> 09:03.866
and then the girls
are gonna call us after.

09:03.867 --> 09:06.268
These guys are stuck
paying for their dinner,

09:06.269 --> 09:08.871
and then we get them
for the good part.

09:08.872 --> 09:11.273
Stupid college guys!
Pretty sweet deal for us.

09:11.274 --> 09:14.276
All the reward with none
of the expense. Yeah, okay.

09:14.277 --> 09:16.846
You kids take care.
We're going out.

09:16.847 --> 09:18.814
Oh, hey, mom.
Before you go,

09:18.815 --> 09:21.350
could you make us something
to eat? Whatever's fast.

09:21.351 --> 09:23.953
Keep walking.
Just keep walking.

09:25.488 --> 09:27.456
<i>Axl did us a favor.</i>

09:27.457 --> 09:30.492
<i>This opportunity was too rare
to waste at home.</i>

09:30.493 --> 09:32.595
<i>We were going out
for Valentine's day</i>

09:32.596 --> 09:34.329
<i>to our favorite
romantic restaurant.</i>

09:34.330 --> 09:36.532
<i>It was dark, it was cozy,
it was...</i>

09:36.533 --> 09:38.434
A relax the back store?

09:40.103 --> 09:42.471
I guess it has been
a long time.

09:49.680 --> 09:51.681
Meow?

09:51.682 --> 09:53.950
No, thanks.
Meow, meow?

09:53.951 --> 09:55.918
'Cause I don't like football.

09:55.919 --> 09:57.853
Do you have any board games

09:57.854 --> 10:00.489
that involve strategy
or fantasy role-playing?

10:00.490 --> 10:03.525
I have a ball
with a bell in it.

10:03.526 --> 10:05.160
How about Crazy Eights?

10:05.161 --> 10:07.196
Hard to shuffle with paws.

10:07.197 --> 10:08.798
You can take them off.

10:08.799 --> 10:11.400
You're remarkably catlike
even without 'em.

10:19.242 --> 10:22.812
2 for dinner. Okay. And you're
fine with a 45-minute wait?

10:24.380 --> 10:27.182
You could at least
have put our name in.

10:27.183 --> 10:30.219
You know I don't wait for more
than ten minutes. Oh, I know.

10:30.220 --> 10:33.155
I know everything about you.
No surprises here. Okay relax.

10:33.156 --> 10:35.625
See? Here's another place.
This looks...

10:35.626 --> 10:39.361
Wow! That line wraps
around the building, too, huh?

10:40.931 --> 10:43.432
What are you doing?
Don't... don't do that.

10:43.433 --> 10:46.335
Are you already going there? We've
been in this car for two hours!

10:46.336 --> 10:48.303
How was I supposed to know

10:48.304 --> 10:51.206
that every restaurant would be
crowded tonight? It's Valentine's day!

10:51.207 --> 10:53.242
Oh, think, Mike! Think!

10:53.243 --> 10:56.578
This was our one chance to have
some fun and celebrate our love,

10:56.579 --> 10:59.481
and you blew it!
I hope you're happy!

10:59.482 --> 11:02.317
Oh, I am.
I definitely am.

11:05.355 --> 11:08.390
Wow, Sue. You look so pretty
with all that makeup...

11:08.391 --> 11:11.727
Like a Kardashian.
I feel like one.

11:13.864 --> 11:16.899
Let's make a pact
that we won't leave each other

11:16.900 --> 11:19.835
the whole night.
Okay!

11:19.836 --> 11:22.204
Hey, you want to dance?
Okay.

11:24.240 --> 11:27.143
Go! Go. It's fine.

11:27.144 --> 11:30.146
I need to check
my eye shadow anyway.

11:38.621 --> 11:40.890
Table for two.

11:40.891 --> 11:42.624
And you're fine
with a 2-hour wait?

11:42.625 --> 11:44.660
He is.

11:44.661 --> 11:47.329
I do get to wait in this drafty
doorway the whole time, right?

11:47.330 --> 11:49.331
'Cause I certainly
wouldn't want to be comfortable.

11:49.332 --> 11:52.168
You are so not getting any
when we get home.

11:52.169 --> 11:54.236
I don't want any.

11:56.150 --> 11:58.585
We already know what we want.
I'll have the tour of Italy

11:58.586 --> 12:00.921
with a house salad,
and he'll have the fettuccine.

12:00.922 --> 12:04.157
And can we get some breadsticks and can
you make it snappy? She's not our waitress.

12:04.158 --> 12:06.527
I'm sorry. I don't know
how to act in a restaurant.

12:06.528 --> 12:09.395
I haven't been in one in
16 years. Oh, ha ha ha.

12:09.896 --> 12:12.364
I'll get your server.

12:15.368 --> 12:17.303
What?

12:24.777 --> 12:27.880
I'm sorry.
Sorry I'm so cranky.

12:27.881 --> 12:30.049
It's okay.
I'm used to it.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.918
Okay.

12:32.919 --> 12:36.856
Let's just start
the whole night over again now.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.457
Okay?

12:39.926 --> 12:42.828
I mean,
look at all these people,

12:42.829 --> 12:44.730
looking into each other's eyes.

12:44.731 --> 12:47.566
We haven't looked each other
in the eye for forever.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.971
Let's look
into each other's eyes.

12:56.176 --> 12:58.110
You look tired.
So do you.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.712
Have you always had
that thing there? What?

13:00.713 --> 13:02.581
You should get it checked.

13:02.582 --> 13:05.717
Can we stop looking now?
Yeah, let's.

13:05.718 --> 13:07.719
New idea.

13:07.720 --> 13:10.622
Let's each name
our five favorite moments

13:10.623 --> 13:13.192
of our marriage, but you
don't use our wedding day

13:13.193 --> 13:15.794
or the birth of our kids in
your top five. I wasn't going to.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.396
You...

13:17.397 --> 13:19.331
Breadsticks!

13:22.903 --> 13:25.170
It's been three hours.
Text 'em again.

13:25.171 --> 13:27.839
Eh, it's cool. They're just
playing hard to get.

13:27.840 --> 13:30.175
We can play hard to get, too.

13:30.176 --> 13:32.311
We should just
stop texting them.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.980
But how are they gonna know
we're playing hard to get

13:34.981 --> 13:38.250
if they're not trying to get us? Mm. We
text 'em, tell 'em we're done texting,

13:38.251 --> 13:41.120
we drive over there,
Darrin puts on a hockey mask,

13:41.121 --> 13:43.122
scares those college guys away,

13:43.123 --> 13:45.757
we beat up Darrin,
we're the big heroes,

13:45.758 --> 13:48.460
and the girls show us
their appreciation.

13:48.461 --> 13:50.029
I love it.

13:50.030 --> 13:52.998
But how can we drive over there
if we don't know where they are?

13:52.999 --> 13:55.935
Damn, you're right. Well...

13:55.936 --> 13:57.903
Someone remember that plan

13:57.904 --> 14:00.339
because that is too good
not to use.

14:03.076 --> 14:05.311
You're really good at this.

14:05.312 --> 14:07.212
I've been practicing.

14:07.213 --> 14:08.780
Practicing.

14:08.781 --> 14:10.816
Why do you whisper like that?

14:10.817 --> 14:13.585
Probably the same reason
you like to be a cat.

14:13.586 --> 14:15.421
Meow.

14:15.422 --> 14:18.223
My mom gave me a Valentine
with some chocolate.

14:18.224 --> 14:20.625
You want some?
Awesome! Thanks.

14:20.626 --> 14:22.461
Squeaky mouse?

14:22.462 --> 14:24.129
I'm good.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.599
Wait, I got one.
What?

14:27.600 --> 14:29.601
Colts winning the Super Bowl.

14:29.602 --> 14:31.803
The colts winning
the Super Bowl

14:31.804 --> 14:34.806
is your fourth favorite moment
of our marriage?

14:34.807 --> 14:37.276
Because... when all
the other wives got bored

14:37.277 --> 14:39.778
and went into the kitchen
to have wine,

14:39.779 --> 14:41.813
you stayed right by me
and shared my beer.

14:43.783 --> 14:45.750
I am cool.

14:45.751 --> 14:47.286
Yes, you are.

14:50.723 --> 14:53.425
Zack's mom.
Mm.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.594
Hi. Everything okay?

14:55.595 --> 14:57.129
No, it's okay.

14:57.130 --> 14:59.865
But they said they'd take him
for the night. A deal's a deal!

14:59.866 --> 15:03.702
Yeah, I understand.
I'll be right there. Bye.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.873
Well, we gave it a shot.

15:07.874 --> 15:11.043
I'll meet you back here
in 16 years. No, no, no!

15:11.044 --> 15:13.512
I'm so enjoying
being with you here right now.

15:13.513 --> 15:15.481
I don't want it to stop.

15:15.482 --> 15:18.617
Just don't move. I'll figure
something out. Okay.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.752
And if the guy
with the breadsticks comes by,

15:20.753 --> 15:21.786
hit me.

15:26.393 --> 15:27.893
Hey, Carly's friend.

15:27.894 --> 15:29.895
We're about to play
"have you ever?"

15:29.896 --> 15:32.364
And "would you rather?"
and "never, ever, have I ever."

15:32.365 --> 15:34.333
Come on.
Everybody's doing it.

15:34.334 --> 15:38.637
Want a beer? I brought it
from home. No! No, I don't!

15:38.638 --> 15:40.705
Well, then you wanna make out?

15:40.706 --> 15:44.309
Everybody, just leave me alone!

15:52.310 --> 15:54.878
I am so sorry.
I don't know what happened.

15:55.112 --> 15:56.447
We try and keep chocolate
out of the house

15:56.481 --> 15:59.449
because of how Zack reacts.

16:00.283 --> 16:03.219
I don't know
where he got it from.

16:03.253 --> 16:05.354
Zack, get off the curtains!

16:05.388 --> 16:07.256
Did you give him chocolate?

16:07.290 --> 16:09.959
It made him purr.

16:09.993 --> 16:13.028
Brick is just great.

16:13.063 --> 16:15.264
We should do this again soon.

16:15.298 --> 16:18.934
Really? You want him
to come over again?

16:18.969 --> 16:21.370
Oh, yeah.
Brick is a dream.

16:21.404 --> 16:22.738
I think

16:22.773 --> 16:27.877
he's the most normal
kid in the group. Oh!

16:29.179 --> 16:31.680
See? It's like
he's not even here.

16:31.714 --> 16:33.916
Let's just start our night again
one more time.

16:33.984 --> 16:36.018
Come on.
Back to us, all right?

16:36.052 --> 16:38.053
Valentine's day.
Let's reclaim the magic.

16:38.088 --> 16:40.555
And you owe me one more
great marriage moment.

16:40.590 --> 16:42.224
Okay.

16:42.259 --> 16:45.494
Give me a minute.
Give me a minute.

16:45.528 --> 16:48.563
I got one. This is a good one.
The time that we...

16:48.598 --> 16:50.332
Son of a...

16:52.269 --> 16:54.203
Hi, honey.
It's Sue.

16:54.237 --> 16:56.738
Everyone is
making out everywhere,

16:56.773 --> 16:58.740
and there is beer.
Someone brought beer?

16:58.775 --> 17:02.845
Who has beer? Oh, I don't know.
Some guy with pretty hair.

17:02.879 --> 17:06.214
And they lit up incense. I'm not
sure if it's illegal or not,

17:06.249 --> 17:07.950
but I'm pretty sure it is.

17:07.983 --> 17:10.886
I really wanna come home,
but then everyone is gonna think

17:10.921 --> 17:12.988
I'm an immature dork for wanting
to leave. I'll be right there.

17:14.825 --> 17:16.892
Oh, my God.

17:16.926 --> 17:19.994
You were right.
She wasn't ready for this.

17:20.030 --> 17:23.464
I'm sorry, did you just say
I was right and you were wrong?

17:23.499 --> 17:27.368
This is
my fifth favorite moment.

17:28.705 --> 17:31.040
Don't move.

17:31.074 --> 17:33.309
Where's my daughter?

17:33.343 --> 17:35.344
Sue Heck?!

17:35.378 --> 17:38.580
Sue Heck,
I know you're in here!

17:41.617 --> 17:44.186
I told you I didn't want you
to come here tonight.

17:44.221 --> 17:45.921
We are leaving immediately.

17:45.956 --> 17:48.657
And if I ever catch you sneaking
out of the house again...

17:49.893 --> 17:51.660
Ah! And it's not gonna help

17:51.694 --> 17:55.197
ya to beg me to let you
stay just one more hour.

17:57.600 --> 18:00.469
Oh, my God!
You're the worst dad ever!

18:00.503 --> 18:02.872
Can you believe this?

18:02.906 --> 18:05.440
Just as the party was
getting good.

18:05.475 --> 18:08.043
Man, this stinks!

18:08.078 --> 18:09.578
Mr. Heck?

18:09.612 --> 18:12.714
My dad didn't want me to come here
either, did he? No, he did not.

18:12.749 --> 18:15.550
You're coming with us.
Get in the car!

18:15.585 --> 18:18.888
Thank you so much, mr. Heck. Be
cool. You're blowing our cover.

18:26.396 --> 18:28.330
Dude, we've been duped.

18:28.365 --> 18:30.866
We're losers!

18:30.901 --> 18:32.935
Losers who have been duped.

18:32.969 --> 18:34.904
Hey!

18:34.938 --> 18:36.605
We're not losers.

18:36.639 --> 18:38.340
They're losers.

18:38.375 --> 18:41.410
Look at what
they're missing out on.

18:41.444 --> 18:43.512
Check out these guns.

18:43.546 --> 18:44.880
We rock.

18:44.915 --> 18:46.548
Yeah.

18:46.582 --> 18:49.684
Yeah! I'm a football hero,
for God sake!

18:49.719 --> 18:51.620
Read it and weep!

18:51.654 --> 18:54.156
They'd take us back if we showed
'em what they're missing.

18:54.190 --> 18:56.758
Shirts off, gentlemen!

19:01.798 --> 19:04.566
All right. Sean, get in closer
behind Darrin.

19:04.600 --> 19:07.169
Darrin, squeeze in.
Closer.

19:07.203 --> 19:09.738
Keep flexing.
Squeeze and now smile.

19:09.772 --> 19:12.041
Smile like we're digging
not being with them.

19:18.048 --> 19:20.749
Dude, we look like three
naked guys hugging each other.

19:20.783 --> 19:23.819
And you can't see what our
hands are doing. And it's sent!

19:25.888 --> 19:27.923
Oh, yeah!
We nailed them so bad!

19:27.958 --> 19:30.059
High-five, my brothers!

19:32.195 --> 19:34.863
I'm so glad your dad
got me out of there, too.

19:34.897 --> 19:37.433
I bet the cops are breaking up
that party right now.

19:37.467 --> 19:40.535
We were lucky to get out
of there alive. I know.

19:40.570 --> 19:42.904
Pinky swear
we never do it again.

19:42.939 --> 19:44.406
Unless someone cute invites us.

19:44.474 --> 19:47.409
Here you go.
Oh, Mike! Aw!

19:47.444 --> 19:50.379
Happy Valentine's day.

19:50.413 --> 19:52.247
Mud pie!

19:54.517 --> 19:57.987
Ladies.
You two look lovely tonight.

19:58.021 --> 20:00.189
Mr. Heck,
nice to see you again.

20:00.223 --> 20:02.624
We already did that.
What are you guys doing here?

20:02.658 --> 20:06.928
What happened to your women? Aw, we blew
'em off. Too many head games. Whatever.

20:06.963 --> 20:09.198
Truth is, I'd rather spend
Valentine's day

20:09.232 --> 20:13.435
with the one woman who means more
to me than anything. Oh, my God! Oh!

20:13.470 --> 20:14.970
That was hilarious!

20:15.005 --> 20:18.540
Did you see how she actually
bought that for a second?

20:18.574 --> 20:21.843
Oh, sucker!
Ooh. Boom.

20:21.878 --> 20:24.380
So you want
to start our night over now?

20:24.414 --> 20:27.416
No. We've tried starting over
three times.

20:27.450 --> 20:29.351
We need to face facts.

20:29.386 --> 20:32.654
This is it.
This is the night we're having.

20:32.688 --> 20:35.391
<i>So Mike and I didn't get
to spend Valentine's day</i>

20:35.425 --> 20:37.993
<i>alone together after all,
but that's okay.</i>

20:38.028 --> 20:40.229
<i>'Cause someday
Axl will be off on a date,</i>

20:40.263 --> 20:43.832
<i>and Sue will be kissing boys
at a party, and brick...</i>

20:43.866 --> 20:46.435
<i>Well, brick will probably be
living in our basement.</i>

20:46.469 --> 20:48.003
<i>But the point is,</i>

20:48.038 --> 20:50.872
<i>someday we'll miss these
Valentine's days together.</i>

20:50.907 --> 20:56.078
<i>So I figured we should treasure
every lame one we had left.</i>
