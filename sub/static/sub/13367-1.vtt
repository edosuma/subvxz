(drawer rattling)

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
(grunts)

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
All right.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
Map. House key.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
You know,

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
I just don’t... I don’t want
my lifestyle to offend you.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
I’m in the middle
of my fellowship,

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
and I work long, odd hours,
I’m not here that much, and...

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
when I am, I’m
usually sleeping.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
But you’ll be
in school--

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
you said you wanted
to go to college, right?

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
Yeah.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
Do you think...

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
that at my age, that’s...

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
a crazy dream?

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
No, no. My first
year of med school,

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
my roommate was 35.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
(beeping)

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
(chuckles softly)

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Like I said, I’m never here.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
(calling):
I could, uh,
drop you off somewhere

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
on my way to the hospital--
you could check out M Street.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
No, I think I’ll
stay and unpack.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
Hey, do you need
any money?

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
(quiet gasp)

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
No, thank you.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
All my numbers.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
So, I’ll, uh...

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
I’ll see you.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
See you.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
Yeah.

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
See you when?

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
Um...

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
I’m not sure.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
But soon.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
Tomorrow morning, maybe.

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
Will you do me a favor

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
and just let
the machine

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
pick up if anyone calls.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
I should first tell people
what’s going on here.

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
It is probably best
to do in person.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
(chuckles)

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
Yeah.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
All right, um...

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
I’ll see you.

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
(door closes)

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
You married her?!

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
Yes, but not in
the biblical way.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
We’re roommates-- she’ll have
her life; I’ll have mine.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
There’s nothing
more to it.
You were supposed

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
to go there and get unmarried,

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
not bring her back
as your bride!

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
I know, but I
couldn’t do it.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
I just couldn’t.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
You did say I should
stay in touch with her--

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
that was your idea.
Shut up. Shut up.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
14 months we’ve
been going together.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
I’m the one that you
should be getting married to.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
You said you wanted
to take it slow.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
I know what I said,
but I didn’t think

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
you were gonna marry
somebody else first!

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
We’re roommates.
Roommates.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
You call it "roommates"--

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
everyone here
will call it married.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
How old is she?
You know, it doesn’t matter.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
You’re married. That’s it.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
You’re not hearing me.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
No, you’re not hearing me.

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
Until you get unmarried,
we’re done!

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
(chuckles)
Oh, come...

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
(door opens)
Carol...

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
Good morning.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
Do you like scrambled eggs?

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
Do you want a cup of tea?

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Uh, coffee’s fine, thanks.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
(pouring coffee)

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
I made you lunch.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
(chuckles) You really
don’t have to wait on me,

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
cook for me.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
Some habits are hard
to break, I guess.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
Right.
Can I now

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
pick up the phone if it rings?

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
Sure.

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
So Carol is fine
with me being here?

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
She’s very cool with it, yeah.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
I really should run.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
Mmm.

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
These are really good.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
By the way,
a man is coming today

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
to blow-torch your oven.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
Makes it kosher.

32:00.000 --> 32:03.000
Okay.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
Well, I got to go.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
Oh, don’t forget
your lunch.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
(chuckles)

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
On your desks,

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
you will find a packet

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
that contains your
study material.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
Please take those out,

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
and let’s begin.

33:29.000 --> 33:32.000
JAKE:
Can I see this one, please?

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
Not gold, dude.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
What you did
calls for platinum.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
I have it in platinum.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Welcome to matrimony.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
I’m not married.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
Not like you and Priya
are married.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Eventually, Leah will move out,
we’ll get this annulled.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
You mean divorced.
Whatever.
Leah will move on,

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
Carol will calm down,
and everything will go back

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000

And you’re on Demerol.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000

didn’t have diamonds.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
Only $4,200.

before I finished cleaning.

Here, let me help you.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
Oh. Jake didn’t
tell you about me?

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
Uh, no... He did.

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
He-he just didn’t mention
that you were coming today.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
I’m so sorry--
this place is a disaster.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
And I got to get this
stuff out of your way.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
Oh, it’s taken care of.

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
Herbert, my husband, moved
everything into the back.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
Thank him for me.
(laughs)

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
I will.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Well, it looks like somebody’s
gonna be doing some baking.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
Yeah. I’m
making challas.

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
The elderly lady I work for
on Wednesday, Mrs. Blaustein,

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
she makes those, too.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
Maybe you know her.
No.

35:26.000 --> 35:30.000
Hm. I thought-- she wears
the same hair as you.

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
Oh, because she’s married,
she wears a wig?

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
Is that why?

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Our real hair

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
shouldn’t excite men
other than our husbands.

35:38.000 --> 35:42.000
Mrs. Blaustein has
nothing to worry about
in that department.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
Mm-hmm.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
EMILY:
I’m guessing,

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
but you being here

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
has shaken things up a bit.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
What do you mean?

35:51.000 --> 35:55.000
You’re here,
and Carol isn’t.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
(Emily chuckling)
(laughs) No.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
No, it’s not like that.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
We’re roommates.

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
Nothing more.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
Hm. Well, that’s too bad,

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
because he is fine!

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
How long have
you worked for Jake?
For years.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
But seriously,
he is a good man.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Well...

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
I’m hoping to get
to find out.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
He doesn’t spend
much time here.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
Oh, that’ll change.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
I have never known a man
to stay away from a home

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
where there’s
someone cooking.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
Well, he doesn’t want
me cooking for him.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
That will definitely change.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
Carol, will you wait up?

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
I don’t want to
speak to you.

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
All right,
so don’t talk then.

just take it.

40:02.000 --> 40:06.000
I don’t have that
now... or a real home.

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
I mean, it’s a place to
sleep, but it’s not a home.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000

sneak off to the movies.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000

40:21.000 --> 40:25.000

47:51.000 --> 47:55.000
So... you never just
hung out with guys?

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
Where I’m from, we don’t go
out with the opposite sex

47:58.000 --> 48:01.000
besides our husbands
or our brothers.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000

48:03.000 --> 48:06.000
No, we’re kept separate until
we’re ready to get married,

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000

by a family friend

48:08.000 --> 48:11.000

matchmaker.

set us up.

48:18.000 --> 48:19.000

It’s not

48:19.000 --> 48:22.000

consider dating--

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
dinner, dancing.

could make a life together.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000

meet Carol?

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000

late lunch schedule,

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
started eating together,

48:44.000 --> 48:49.000
and, and it turned
into what we have now.

let the other one know

you know, the one you told me
about-- Doctor Zhivago.

55:13.000 --> 55:14.000
Leah?

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
I’m in love with him, Em.

55:22.000 --> 55:25.000
Oh.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
Well, have you two,
you know...?

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
No.

55:29.000 --> 55:30.000
Of course not.

55:30.000 --> 55:34.000
Jake loves Carol.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
How could I have let
this happen?

55:36.000 --> 55:39.000
He’s taking her to Jamaica.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
Well, maybe to try
to convince himself

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
there’s nothing
between you and him.

55:43.000 --> 55:44.000
Oh,

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
honey.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
You are not the type of person

55:48.000 --> 55:49.000
to have these feelings
for no reason.

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
Obviously,

55:50.000 --> 55:54.000
I am.

55:54.000 --> 55:58.000
He was just being nice.

55:58.000 --> 56:03.000
Here, men can be nice
and take you to dinner...

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
(quavering):
...and swimming,
and it doesn’t mean anything.

56:05.000 --> 56:06.000
I’ve got to move out, Em.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
Leah.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
(horns honking)

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
Hi, I’m calling
about the studio apartment.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
Is that still available?

56:21.000 --> 56:24.000
Yeah, that would be great.

56:24.000 --> 56:25.000
Oh.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Could you hold on?

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
Hi, Mama.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
No, I’m shopping for dinner.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.000
I think this arrhythmia case is

56:38.000 --> 56:39.000
a better choice
for Journal Club.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
Dr. Lever,

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
your wife is
on the phone.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
My what?
Your wife.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
JAKE:
Leah?

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
My mother is coming here.

56:47.000 --> 56:48.000
When?

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow?

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Yes.

56:52.000 --> 56:55.000
She’s coming to check on us...
and this marriage.

56:55.000 --> 56:59.000
Uh... I have got to make
your place look like a home.

56:59.000 --> 57:00.000
Leah, why don’t you
just tell her?

57:00.000 --> 57:03.000
No, n--
you don’t "just tell" Mama.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
Well, this might be the perfect
time to stand up to her.

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
Just tell her the truth
about us.

57:07.000 --> 57:08.000
You don’t understand.

57:08.000 --> 57:09.000
She will make my life
a living hell.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
She can do that.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
She’s a professional.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
Look, I know you’re going away,

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
and I can just make something up
about why you’re not there,

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
but...

57:19.000 --> 57:24.000
if you’d help me to get
your apartment into shape,

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
I promise I’ll never ask
anything of you ever again.

57:27.000 --> 57:30.000
Well?

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
BOTH:
We’ll take it.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
Excellent.

57:37.000 --> 57:38.000
What else?

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Um, curtains.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
end tables,
lamps.

57:42.000 --> 57:43.000
Let me see.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
Let’s get a rug
for the coffee table.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
I’ve got
some fantastic area rugs,

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
20% off.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
Those pillows are perfect.

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
Right up her alley.

58:00.000 --> 58:04.000
Which medical conference
should I say you’re attending?

58:04.000 --> 58:08.000
Let me look at the schedule
to see what’s coming up.

58:17.000 --> 58:18.000
Hi.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
How did you
like the...?

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
(Jake clears throat)

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
Um, we’re looking

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
for very simple wedding bands
like those.

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
What are you going
to make your mom for dinner?

58:33.000 --> 58:36.000
Um, brisket.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
I do love
your brisket.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
What?

58:49.000 --> 58:50.000
(chuckles)

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
You’re not going
to believe this.

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
It involves Leah.

58:54.000 --> 58:57.000
Her mother--
she’s coming.

58:57.000 --> 58:58.000
I have to help her.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
I’m sorry,
but I have to.

59:00.000 --> 59:05.000
I-I will more than
make this up to you--

59:05.000 --> 59:06.000
I will do the re-booking.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
Whenever you say--
next week

59:08.000 --> 59:09.000
if that works for you.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
Really, no more interferences.

59:11.000 --> 59:14.000
You told me that she was going
to get her own place

59:14.000 --> 59:15.000
and you were end this marriage.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
I know.

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
But I felt like a jerk.

59:19.000 --> 59:20.000
I mean, she came
down here for me.

59:20.000 --> 59:23.000
I just can’t abandon her.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
Good-bye, Jake.

59:25.000 --> 59:29.000
(over P.A.):
Dr. Lao, pick up
extension 632.

59:29.000 --> 59:32.000
Dr. Lao, pick up extension 632.

59:32.000 --> 59:35.000
LEAH:
Thank you for coming with me.
Yeah, of course.

59:35.000 --> 59:36.000
Oh, when you get
to Jamaica

59:36.000 --> 59:37.000
don’t forget to call

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
to make it look like
you’re checking in.

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
Well, actually, there’s
been a change in plans.

59:41.000 --> 59:42.000
I’m staying.

59:42.000 --> 59:45.000
Really?

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
Vayzmeer!

59:47.000 --> 59:48.000
What?

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
If you’re staying,

59:50.000 --> 59:53.000
that means I’ll be sleeping in
your bedroom with you in it.

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
Oh, yeah, that’s right.

59:58.000 --> 59:59.000
Leah.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Hi, Mama.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Oh...

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Hi, Mom.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Could you
get this?
Sure.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Uh... I’ll take that.
Thank you.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000
How was your trip?

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Short.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Like your skirt.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Oh.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Uh-huh.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Ah.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Nice pillows.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000
No.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Honey...

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000
we’re having brisket tonight.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
No butter.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Oh! Of course.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
I’m sorry, sweetcakes.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000
"Sweetcakes"?

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000
It’s... his name for me, Mama.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.000
(quietly):
Well, I certainly hope
he doesn’t use it in public.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
It smells delicious.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Mama,

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Jake is one of three
who was accepted

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
to the cardiac
fellowship program.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Out of thousands.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Actually, it was hundreds.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Do you belong to a shul, Jake?

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
(clears throat quietly)

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000
A shul?
Yeah.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
No.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
I belong to a gym.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000
(chuckles softly)

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.000
That’s the sense of humor
you said he had.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
JAKE:
I got Leah there

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
for a swimming lesson.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Hm.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Time for recreation;
no time for shul.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
JAKE:
We talked...

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
about joining,

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
for the future.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Does the future
include a family?

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Sure, yes.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
After I get
my practice started.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
I want to be the kind of dad

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000
who has time to spend
with his kids.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Then what’s Leah’s job?

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Oh. Well...

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000
my wife.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Leah’s...

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000
gonna make
a great mom.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Just as you have.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
And wha-what a cook.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
But you’re still the best, Mama.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Yes, you are.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Are you saying
I’m better than your wife?

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
(clears throat):
Uh...

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
I-I don’t have an answer
for that one.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000
(basketball game playing on TV)

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.000
(TV turns off)

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.000
I’d say we pulled it off.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
(laughs) Shh.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
(big sigh)

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
That’s just a warm-up.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Wait till tomorrow.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.000
(sighs) When you brought up
the swimming...

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000
What, you’re not allowed
to swim?

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Not with the opposite sex.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Where’s the fun in that?

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Do you have an extra blanket?

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Yeah, it’s in the closet--
I’ll get it.
I’ll get it, I’ll get it.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000
(loud clattering)

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Shh-shh...

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Sorry.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Here.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
(groans)
(gasps)

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000
What?

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
I left my nightgown
under the pillow.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Oh, no.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000
What do we do?

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
I’ll just tell her that

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
I had to sleep
in the guest room,

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
’cause you, uh, had
the German measles.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
(laughs)

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Look, if she asks,
go with a cold.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Or even better, say
your snoring kept me up,
and I had an early call.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
That’s good.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
I don’t know if I snore.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Look, don’t worry,
we’ll figure it out.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Okay.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Here, try these.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Oh.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Thanks.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000
MAN (on TV):
Find romance.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Jamaica awaits.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Come find your paradise.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Jamaica.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
(tropical music plays)

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000
(exhales)

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
(laughs quietly)

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Leah, the bed is

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000
wider than Rhode Island.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Look.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000
I’m in Massachusetts.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
I’m sorry.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Um...

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.000
I can see how this is all
really new for you.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000
You do whatever
makes you feel comfortable.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000
I’m gonna turn
the light off now.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Ready?

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.000
This is like that movie,
It Happened One Night.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000
I don’t know that one.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Black-and-white, 1934.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Clark Gable
and Claudette Colbert.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:06.000
They shared a room,
not married, in a motel,

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000
and they were broke,
so Clark Gable hung a sheet

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.000
I could never cook.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Jake was always very,
very kind about it.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
He never complains.
Very diplomatic child.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
On the other hand,

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Benji used to call up his
friends every single night

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.000
to find out what their
mothers were cooking.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.000
He re, he enrolled me
in cooking school.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Do you remember that?

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
I went, but I
couldn’t do it.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
I can’t measure.
It’s just not me.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
I was giving the
teacher agita.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
I was, I was,
driving her crazy.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.000
They finally
threw me out.
(laughing)

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.000
They gave him
his money back.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.000
(laughing)

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000
I’m gonna tell
that story

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
at the unveiling, I think.
And you know what?

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
You should pick a good
story about your brother.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Or, or maybe that’s
not permissible
where he’s buried?

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
No, it is.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Is it? Good.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
And what’s with
the little rock

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:08.000
that they put
on the gravestone?

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.000
It shows the soul
that someone’s been
to visit.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Isn’t that nice?

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Actually, I haven’t heard
from the mortuary

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.000
since I picked out
the stone.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
That was in September.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Oh, I got a letter.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Jake, did you get
a letter?

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Mm-mm.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.000
It’s just a little reminder
to say, you know,

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
you have to set a date
for the unveiling.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.000
It’s been almost a year.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.000
And listen, you two,
whatever you want,

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
whatever you decide,
it’s fine with me.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.000
What do you think?

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.000
I’ll have to check my schedule.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Ma, how’s Aunt Francine doing?

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Francine?
Yeah.
She’s fine.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.000
She’s complaining about
everybody and everything.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Darling, what
do you think?

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Should we have
maybe a little lunch?

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.000
the day of the unveiling?

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
I’d like that.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Jakie?

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
What?

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Oh, lunch, sure.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Okay. Well, we’re gonna
have to set a date.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Ma!

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.000
I heard you,

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
and I’ll get to it!

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
I’m sorry.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Excuse me.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Hey.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.000
What’s wrong?

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
I don’t want to talk about it.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Is it me?

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
No.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
It’s us. It’s...

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
it’s these.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Our letters.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
I feel like I’m betraying Ben.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.000
I mean, you
were his wife.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Don’t you feel guilty?

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
No.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
I love you.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:21.000
That’s what I feel.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Did you love him?

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Our marriage wasn’t
set up like that.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.000
I was 18.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Your brother

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000
was a good man.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
He was very serious,

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.000
dedicated...

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:58.000
but there was something
missing between us.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.000
You didn’t answer my question.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Did you love him?

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
You know, I didn’t plan
this would happen between us.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.000
I gotta go.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
(sighs)

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
(phone ringing)

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.000
I don’t know what to do.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Dude, it was so much easier
when you dated non-relatives.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Sorry.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Look, man, maybe you’re
looking at this all wrong.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Maybe the brother you
shunned all those years

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:09.000
is actually looking
out for you.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Don’t go.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.000
I don’t know how to make
this right for him.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.000
It’s just too complicated.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Next is room 217.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:43.000
(cell phone chirping)
65-year-old Caucasian male,

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
who developed end stage
heart disease...

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Excuse me one second.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:32.000
Leah’s SAT scores
arrived.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:33.000
She’s gone.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.000
That’s for you.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:54.000
Listen, I know how much
you loved your brother.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
So I know what’s
eating you.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:01.000
But you love Leah,
and she loves you.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:05.000
So, if God

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:08.000
arranged this marriage,
which apparently He did,

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:14.000
I think He’s going to take
a very dim view of it

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
if you mess it up.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.000
(applause)

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Good to see you.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Shabbat Shalom.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Shabbat Shalom.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:32.000
WOMAN:
Thank you so much.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Shabbat Shalom.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Shabbat Shalom.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Nice service.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Well, I hope that means
you’ll come again.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
I think I might.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.000
My brother was a rabbi.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
He, uh, died this past May.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.000
My condolences.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:58.000
I need to ask his forgiveness.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Is that possible?

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Your brother is in what
we call a place of truth.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Sort of a holding pattern.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:13.000
It is in this place
that it is possible

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.000
to fix a wrong.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Can you show me a prayer?

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:24.000
(door closing)

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
MAMA:
Three days you’re
here and not a word?

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:30.000
You want to talk?

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Everything I prayed for...

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:39.000
came true.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:43.000
(voice breaking):
Just like you said.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
(sniffling)
Only I ran away.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.000
This is the only thing
I seem to do well.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Look at me back here.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:54.000
I’ve got to stop running away.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
You’re right.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Go back to your home.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
You love him.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:08.000
He, Jake, loves you.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Leah, even in the best of
marriages problems don’t leave.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
People do.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:19.000
What if he can’t
get over the fact

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:20.000
that I was married to Benjamin?

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:27.000
You know, I saw something
back there in Washington.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:30.000
You and he-- Jake, you and Jake,

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
work together as a team.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Even if it was just to convince
me that you were living together

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.000
as husband and wife.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
I think he’ll get over it.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Does this mean you
accept me with him?

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Leah-- a mother,

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:48.000
you should only
find out soon,

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
is only as happy
as her saddest child.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:54.000
I want you to be happy.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:57.000
And back there, you
were happy, right?

01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Yeah.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
God kept you two together
long enough to find each other.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.000
And you know me--
I never argue with God.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Come here.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
What are we doing out here
when you’ve got packing to do?

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Okay.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.000
All right, another hug.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Me, too.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:41.000
The meter’s running.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Go, go.
Bye.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Penn Station, please.
You got it.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
(car horn honking)

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Wait, Leah!

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Wait, wait, wait.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Wait.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Hi.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Hi.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Hi.
Hi.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Uh, your test scores.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Oh.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.000
And?

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:27.000
Um...
Open it.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Go on.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.000
Yeah? So?

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.000
She did great.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.000
1920 total score,

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.000
600 on math.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
I did great!

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:44.000
She passed.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
MAMA:
And you drove
all this way

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:49.000
to give her test scores?

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
Esther.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Get in. We’re going
for a short ride.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
I want you to go around
the block slowly.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
You know,

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
things happen
when you’re around.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
I think I’m growing on them.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
Yeah.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
You look good.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
I mean, you
always look good.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
You, too.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:20.000
I went to temple.
You did?

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:21.000
It’s still standing.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
(both laughing)

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:28.000
You remember Ben’s funeral--

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
the rabbi said that Ben
left us a gift

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
in the form of a lesson?

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:35.000
It was you, Leah.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Ben’s way of taking care of me

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
was to bring me
someone I could love.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
I know.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
He did the same for me.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
I want to marry you.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
We’re already married.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
No. No, no.
