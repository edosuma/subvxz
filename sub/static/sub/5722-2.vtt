00:08.035 --> 00:09.802
<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

00:10.104 --> 00:12.371
I'd like you to meet my Head
of Security, Carrie Mathison.

00:12.373 --> 00:14.773
- We are going to Lebanon.
- Us?

00:14.775 --> 00:17.142
You, me,
some additional security.

00:17.144 --> 00:20.045
Additional security is what we
take to conferences in Geneva.

00:20.047 --> 00:21.346
This is a war zone.

00:21.348 --> 00:22.848
What do you want?

00:22.850 --> 00:25.350
Otto During is planning a visit
later this week.

00:25.352 --> 00:28.053
He can't go there safely
without your invitation.

00:28.055 --> 00:30.188
Only the council can invite him.

00:30.190 --> 00:32.290
This is really
getting old-- the CIA saying

00:32.292 --> 00:34.659
I'm a traitor, you saying
I'm still working for the CIA.

00:34.661 --> 00:36.128
I don't want to be
in that world.

00:36.130 --> 00:37.329
I want to be here

00:37.331 --> 00:38.730
<i>with you and Franny.</i>

00:38.732 --> 00:40.232
- What?
- He's attacking us.

00:40.234 --> 00:41.233
- Who is?
- What the fuck?

00:41.235 --> 00:43.235
- What?
- He's in.

00:43.237 --> 00:44.736
Shut it down. Shut it down!
Shut it down!

00:44.738 --> 00:46.238
Holy shit, it's the CIA.

00:46.240 --> 00:48.173
<i>1,361 files?</i>

00:48.175 --> 00:49.975
Want to tell me how our
classified network

00:49.977 --> 00:52.077
got within a thousand miles
of the goddamn internet?

00:52.079 --> 00:54.846
I got an e-mail
today from a hacker.

00:54.848 --> 00:57.649
It describes a completely
illegal arrangement

00:57.651 --> 00:59.251
between German
and American intelligence.

00:59.253 --> 01:01.653
Germany's doing an end run
around its privacy laws

01:01.655 --> 01:03.989
by having the US do
the spying for them.

01:03.991 --> 01:05.524
<i>I want to be
sure you understand--</i>

01:05.525 --> 01:06.925
<i>you'll get no support.</i>

01:06.927 --> 01:08.427
You'll be out
of the Agency.

01:08.429 --> 01:10.028
All you get is that key,

01:10.030 --> 01:11.997
your next target in the
box and operating money

01:11.999 --> 01:13.999
waiting there when you
bring back proof of death.

01:15.903 --> 01:17.402
Hello.

01:17.404 --> 01:19.071
The council
invites Otto During

01:19.073 --> 01:21.940
to visit General Alladia Camp
as our honored guest.

03:16.623 --> 03:19.090
Looks like
it's already started.

03:31.004 --> 03:33.305
Here we are,
ladies and gents.

03:33.307 --> 03:35.774
<i>The General Alladia Camp.</i>

03:40.047 --> 03:43.114
During Foundation,
here to see Colonel Haugen.

03:57.064 --> 03:58.830
They're all clear.
Send 'em through.

04:02.236 --> 04:04.035
Okay.

04:04.037 --> 04:05.270
Park over there.

04:48.382 --> 04:52.217
What about the other
meeting-- Hezbollah?

04:52.219 --> 04:55.220
They contact me.
How wasn't specified.

04:55.222 --> 04:57.489
I assume they know I'm here.

04:57.491 --> 05:00.058
Oh, yeah.

05:00.060 --> 05:01.326
Carrie?

05:01.328 --> 05:03.962
He's ready.

05:03.964 --> 05:06.631
Colonel Haugen?

05:06.633 --> 05:08.433
Philipp Becker.

05:08.435 --> 05:10.235
I handle foreign aid
for Otto During.

05:10.237 --> 05:12.270
This is Carrie Mathison,
his Head of Security,

05:12.272 --> 05:13.938
and Mike Brown,
whom I think you've met.

05:13.940 --> 05:15.307
Last year with Angelina.

05:15.309 --> 05:16.908
And, Ms. Mathison,
we spoke on the phone.

05:16.910 --> 05:19.010
Good to meet you
in person, Colonel.

05:19.012 --> 05:21.479
All right. Come in.

05:25.619 --> 05:29.020
You saw on the road,
things are changing fast.

05:29.022 --> 05:31.156
How many people
are you getting a day?

05:31.158 --> 05:32.691
More all the time.

05:32.693 --> 05:35.260
Yesterday, it was a
thousand, so this is not

05:35.262 --> 05:36.995
the best time for a visit.

05:36.997 --> 05:39.364
The flow of refugees is
only going to increase, sir.

05:39.366 --> 05:41.499
You'll need resources, and Mr.
During will ensure you get them.

05:41.501 --> 05:43.368
Yeah, and I'm grateful,
but why does he need

05:43.370 --> 05:44.669
all the journalists,
the TV crew?

05:44.671 --> 05:46.171
To get the message out.

05:46.173 --> 05:48.206
The Syrian war is an old story,
I'm afraid.

05:48.208 --> 05:50.475
- Yeah. - What can you tell me
about the security situation?

05:50.477 --> 05:52.344
You mean, is it safe?

05:52.346 --> 05:55.046
Well...

05:55.048 --> 05:57.649
This is where we are,

05:57.651 --> 06:00.018
and this is where you are safe.

06:00.020 --> 06:02.220
Mr. During will need
to go farther than that,

06:02.222 --> 06:03.955
and so will the press.

06:03.957 --> 06:06.858
He needs to be seen in the camp,
not just in a UN compound.

06:06.860 --> 06:08.827
Well, this is where you're safe.

06:12.532 --> 06:14.766
I'm in a meeting.

06:17.304 --> 06:19.237
Will you excuse me?

06:20.807 --> 06:22.507
You want to
get that message

06:22.509 --> 06:23.742
out there, too?

06:23.744 --> 06:25.477
What message?

06:25.479 --> 06:28.747
That your foundation does deals
with Hezbollah?

06:28.749 --> 06:31.249
A conversation is
not a deal, Colonel.

06:31.251 --> 06:34.486
And Mr. During needs to be able
to move freely around the camp.

06:34.488 --> 06:36.788
As you wish.

07:18.265 --> 07:20.632
Listen, if things
get gnarly...

07:20.634 --> 07:22.267
It won't.

07:27.307 --> 07:29.707
- You want to search us?
- Yes.

07:43.789 --> 07:46.869
_

07:57.671 --> 07:59.137
Not you.

08:00.440 --> 08:02.040
It's okay.

08:14.988 --> 08:16.788
Salaam alaikum.

08:16.790 --> 08:19.023
Alaikum salaam.

08:21.027 --> 08:23.661
I speak English
better than your Arabic.

08:23.663 --> 08:26.498
The During Foundation
is grateful.

08:26.500 --> 08:28.099
You were CIA.

08:28.101 --> 08:30.435
I was in the CIA.

08:30.437 --> 08:32.303
I'm a private citizen now.

08:32.304 --> 08:34.873
I was given safe passage
by the council.

08:34.875 --> 08:36.341
Mr. During

08:36.342 --> 08:39.344
was invited here
by Commander Al-Amin in Berlin.

08:39.346 --> 08:42.212
Al-Amin thinks
I can't run my own camp?

08:42.215 --> 08:44.716
No one's saying that.

08:44.718 --> 08:46.551
We negotiated
a substantial payment

08:46.553 --> 08:49.320
for your help in providing
security for our visit.

08:49.322 --> 08:51.356
What payment?
I've seen nothing.

08:51.358 --> 08:53.858
It was transferred
to Al-Amin's account.

08:55.462 --> 08:57.195
No. Wait.

08:57.197 --> 08:58.696
Please. Just listen to me.

08:58.698 --> 09:00.899
I assure you
it'll be worth your time.

09:03.136 --> 09:04.569
I just need my backpack?

09:04.571 --> 09:07.005
What is in the backpack?

09:07.007 --> 09:10.375
It's $40,000.

09:10.377 --> 09:14.412
For you, Waleed,
to use as you see fit.

09:14.414 --> 09:16.881
I know that an agreement made
by one Hezbollah commander

09:16.883 --> 09:19.384
will be honored by another.

09:24.758 --> 09:26.824
So we have a deal?

09:28.862 --> 09:31.262
Yes.

09:31.264 --> 09:33.865
But, uh...

09:33.867 --> 09:37.402
- What?
- The camp is overrun.

09:37.404 --> 09:40.038
Every day, it gets worse.

09:40.040 --> 09:41.873
All kind of scum

09:41.875 --> 09:44.509
from across the border--
Al-Nusra,

09:44.511 --> 09:47.345
Al-Qaeda, Daesh.

09:47.347 --> 09:49.747
- What are you saying?
- Stay no more

09:49.749 --> 09:51.516
than one hour.

09:51.518 --> 09:53.117
Even I can't guarantee
Mr. During's safety

09:53.119 --> 09:54.519
longer than that.

09:54.521 --> 09:58.256
Okay. One hour.

10:02.896 --> 10:05.296
<i>And dominating
our program today,</i>

10:05.298 --> 10:08.066
as it has dominated
headlines across Europe,

10:08.068 --> 10:10.201
is news of this
shocking document

10:10.203 --> 10:13.137
which suggests German
intelligence is working

10:13.139 --> 10:18.109
with the CIA to bypass
Germany's privacy laws.

10:18.111 --> 10:22.313
Our guest is the woman who
published the document--

10:22.315 --> 10:24.749
The dissident American
journalist Laura Sutton.

10:24.751 --> 10:26.384
Welcome.

10:26.386 --> 10:29.153
Thanks. Can I correct
one thing right away?

10:29.155 --> 10:30.922
The document doesn't <i> suggest</i>

10:30.924 --> 10:33.257
a relationship.
It absolutely proves it.

10:33.259 --> 10:36.160
It details every aspect of the
arrangement, even its budget.

10:36.162 --> 10:38.763
It's quite shocking.

10:38.765 --> 10:42.066
So you're not surprised
that the Chancellery

10:42.068 --> 10:44.836
is scrambling to distance itself
from the affair?

10:44.838 --> 10:47.138
I'm not.

10:47.140 --> 10:49.474
But I think your
security services have a lot

10:49.476 --> 10:50.742
to answer for, too.

10:50.744 --> 10:52.944
Plus, I only saw
the one document.

10:52.946 --> 10:54.846
It could just be the tip
of the iceberg.

10:54.848 --> 10:57.649
Talk about a clusterfuck.

10:59.653 --> 11:02.186
And there's something else.

11:02.188 --> 11:06.290
The BND's had a team on
Laura Sutton ever since

11:06.292 --> 11:08.826
- she came to Berlin.
- A test?

11:08.828 --> 11:11.162
My source wanted
to see what I would do.

11:11.164 --> 11:12.797
How I would release
the information.

11:12.799 --> 11:15.299
In fact, if I would
release it at all, but I hope...

11:15.301 --> 11:17.168
When was this taken?

11:17.170 --> 11:19.370
Same day as the penetration.

11:19.372 --> 11:22.206
How can you be sure
it's a genuine CIA document?

11:22.208 --> 11:24.475
Let's just say I know it is.

11:24.477 --> 11:26.477
You think Carrie's involved?

11:26.479 --> 11:29.480
I really can't see it,

11:29.482 --> 11:33.151
but they do both work
for During.

11:33.153 --> 11:37.355
Do you expect any
retaliation from the BND?

11:37.357 --> 11:39.691
- I mean, personally?
- Oh, yeah, I'm sure

11:39.693 --> 11:42.293
they're searching
my apartment right now.

11:42.295 --> 11:43.961
- That doesn't upset you?
- Mm. Gotten used to it.

11:43.963 --> 11:46.264
As long as they don't
let the cat out.

11:47.005 --> 11:47.964
_

11:47.965 --> 11:49.366
_

11:49.845 --> 11:51.025
_

11:54.783 --> 11:56.545
_

11:58.330 --> 12:00.123
_

12:01.048 --> 12:02.986
_

12:03.021 --> 12:05.083
...annoying people
who gets angry

12:05.085 --> 12:09.253
whenever they see hard-won
rights being ignored or abused.

12:09.255 --> 12:12.190
I moved here
because of the protections

12:12.192 --> 12:14.726
Germany guarantees
its citizens and its guests.

12:14.728 --> 12:16.994
You have these laws
because you know

12:16.996 --> 12:18.730
how bad it can get.
You've lived it.

12:18.732 --> 12:20.598
You saw the surveillance state
tear society apart,

12:20.600 --> 12:22.533
and you said, "no more."

12:22.535 --> 12:24.535
But it seems
your own intelligence agency

12:24.537 --> 12:25.870
wasn't listening.

12:25.872 --> 12:27.438
Now, I'm not a German citizen,

12:27.440 --> 12:28.606
- but I understand the implications...
- Bring her in.

12:28.608 --> 12:30.441
...of a covert program like this.

12:30.443 --> 12:32.543
- I wouldn't be surprised if we found similar
operations... - Don't we need a warrant?

12:32.545 --> 12:34.846
- ...in other countries, aimed at skirting...
- Just do it.

12:34.848 --> 12:36.247
...national privacy regulations.

12:36.249 --> 12:38.883
Germany is by no means
the first country

12:38.885 --> 12:43.287
to spy on its citizens,
but the BND was smart about it.

12:43.289 --> 12:45.690
They outsourced the dirty work
to the CIA.

12:45.692 --> 12:48.693
Every paper and TV channel.

12:48.695 --> 12:51.529
And all over the web.
I told you

12:51.531 --> 12:52.764
- she would do it.
- Shh.

12:52.766 --> 12:54.265
Who was the source

12:54.267 --> 12:55.900
of the leak?

12:55.902 --> 12:58.703
Was it from inside
German intelligence?

12:58.705 --> 13:00.571
I've no idea.

13:00.573 --> 13:04.208
All I know is
he or she took a big risk

13:04.210 --> 13:07.211
to expose this.

13:07.213 --> 13:11.716
I'm honored
they reached out to me,

13:11.718 --> 13:15.052
and I will respect their trust,

13:15.054 --> 13:17.588
whatever happens to me.

13:17.590 --> 13:19.257
You hear that?

13:19.259 --> 13:22.093
I'm sure you took
a big risk yourself...

13:22.095 --> 13:24.595
She's asking for the rest of it.

13:24.597 --> 13:27.732
She also said she's got cops
in her apartment.

13:27.734 --> 13:29.734
You send that,
it'll be intercepted,

13:29.736 --> 13:31.736
traced back to us.

13:31.738 --> 13:33.905
She's at the TV station.

13:33.907 --> 13:35.139
I'll take it to her.

13:35.141 --> 13:36.908
Dude, wait, we should talk
about this.

13:36.910 --> 13:38.442
Talk about what?

13:38.444 --> 13:40.678
Look at her.
She's on TV.

13:40.680 --> 13:42.013
So?

13:42.015 --> 13:46.017
So... she's getting rich
out of this.

13:46.019 --> 13:48.486
Why not us?

13:50.423 --> 13:53.624
Make money out of sex, Korzy,
not information.

13:53.626 --> 13:55.660
Information's for free.

14:06.496 --> 14:08.270
_

14:09.495 --> 14:10.822
_

14:12.025 --> 14:13.344
_

14:17.660 --> 14:19.538
_

14:29.324 --> 14:31.876
_

14:32.539 --> 14:34.321
_

14:34.322 --> 14:36.512
_

14:36.513 --> 14:39.561
_

14:40.515 --> 14:41.642
_

14:46.356 --> 14:48.141
_

14:51.970 --> 14:53.167
_

14:53.168 --> 14:55.663
_

14:55.664 --> 14:59.311
_

14:59.312 --> 15:01.546
_

15:01.547 --> 15:04.015
_

15:04.016 --> 15:05.906
_

15:05.907 --> 15:07.173
_

15:07.174 --> 15:08.711
_

16:35.588 --> 16:37.455
Thought it went

16:37.457 --> 16:40.024
- really well, so...
- Yeah. Let's definitely keep in touch.

16:40.026 --> 16:41.692
- Absolutely.
- You have all my details.

16:41.694 --> 16:43.327
Yeah. Let me know
if you need anything.

16:43.329 --> 16:44.662
- Thank you. Bye.
- Okay. Take care. Bye.

16:50.269 --> 16:52.670
Laura Sutton, Hans Podolski,
Bundesnachrichtendienst.

16:52.672 --> 16:54.638
- You've got to be kidding.
- You're under arrest.

16:54.640 --> 16:55.973
- Please come with us.
- Get off of me.

16:55.975 --> 16:57.208
What's the charge?

16:57.210 --> 16:58.809
Tell me, what's
the charge?

16:58.811 --> 17:00.277
Go.

17:08.707 --> 17:11.053
_

17:20.500 --> 17:22.500
- We good, Lothar?
- We're good.

17:22.502 --> 17:25.202
Mr. During arrived safely.
The top two floors are secured.

17:25.204 --> 17:26.971
He'd like to see you
when you're ready.

17:26.973 --> 17:28.973
Okay.

17:31.144 --> 17:33.644
Uh, tell Otto I'll be right up
after I grab a shower.

17:33.646 --> 17:35.246
Sure thing.

17:38.084 --> 17:39.183
- Hank. Hey.
- Carrie.

17:39.185 --> 17:40.651
Hey.

17:40.653 --> 17:43.054
What a surprise.

17:43.056 --> 17:44.922
But not really.

17:44.924 --> 17:47.091
What can I say?
It's a small town.

17:47.093 --> 17:50.428
Well, so much
for the discreet entry.

17:52.365 --> 17:54.265
Got to admit,
I didn't believe it.

17:54.267 --> 17:55.933
Believe what?

17:55.935 --> 17:57.568
When I heard it was you.

17:57.570 --> 17:59.570
Coming here.
Otto During?

17:59.572 --> 18:00.905
I work
for him now.

18:00.907 --> 18:03.007
Yeah, that's what was hard
to believe.

18:03.009 --> 18:04.341
What do you mean?

18:04.343 --> 18:07.711
Come on, Carrie.
It's a play, right?

18:07.713 --> 18:10.114
Classic Trojan horse.

18:10.116 --> 18:12.883
Something you and Saul cooked up

18:12.885 --> 18:15.119
to get you inside
the foundation.

18:15.121 --> 18:16.921
It's not like that, Hank.

18:16.923 --> 18:18.923
Seriously.

18:20.059 --> 18:22.793
Hey, whatever you say.

18:25.231 --> 18:27.231
Listen,

18:27.233 --> 18:30.734
today at General Alladia,
you met with Hezbollah, right?

18:30.736 --> 18:33.938
Probably with
Waleed himself.

18:33.940 --> 18:36.273
With the influx
of refugees,

18:36.275 --> 18:38.709
how compromised is his control
of the camp, do you think?

18:38.711 --> 18:40.611
- I told you, Hank, I'm out.
- Yeah,

18:40.613 --> 18:41.812
I'm just asking your opinion.

18:41.814 --> 18:43.247
And I can't be perceived

18:43.249 --> 18:45.316
to be helping the Agency
in any way.

18:45.318 --> 18:48.352
You're joking.

18:51.290 --> 18:53.357
Actually, I'm not.

19:41.107 --> 19:44.041
Carrie.

19:45.311 --> 19:47.378
Welcome to Beirut.

19:48.347 --> 19:50.548
<i>Prost.</i>

19:50.550 --> 19:52.850
It's good. It's local
but really quite good.

19:52.852 --> 19:54.685
I'm surprised.

19:55.721 --> 19:57.721
Shame I can't tempt you.

20:00.126 --> 20:03.027
I'm nine months sober tomorrow.

20:03.963 --> 20:06.397
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

20:09.168 --> 20:11.368
I know, I know. My party.

20:11.370 --> 20:14.705
I would have liked to have been
consulted-- that's all.

20:14.707 --> 20:17.141
And to have seen the guest list.

20:17.143 --> 20:18.909
I know
these people.

20:18.911 --> 20:20.911
I have ties here, remember?

20:20.913 --> 20:23.414
Why else would the government
invite me?

20:23.416 --> 20:25.416
And, yes, I'll be honest,

20:25.418 --> 20:28.285
coming all this way, I thought
I'd do some business, too.

20:31.190 --> 20:33.591
Philipp says, from
his point of view,

20:33.593 --> 20:35.826
we're all set.
Do you agree?

20:35.828 --> 20:39.163
Hezbollah's cooperating.

20:39.165 --> 20:41.165
But?

20:41.167 --> 20:44.168
Well, the situation
on the ground is unpredictable,

20:44.170 --> 20:46.337
to say the least.

20:46.339 --> 20:48.405
Meaning what?

20:48.407 --> 20:50.241
Meaning we've been told
to limit the time of the visit

20:50.243 --> 20:53.077
to one hour. No more.

20:53.079 --> 20:54.845
One hour will be tight.

20:54.847 --> 20:56.513
These things drag on--

20:56.515 --> 20:59.283
Introductions,
handshakes, speeches, e...

21:02.221 --> 21:05.122
Okay. One hour.

21:14.200 --> 21:16.000
It's probably a wedding.

21:17.203 --> 21:19.803
Of course. A wedding.

21:26.946 --> 21:30.147
But you, you...
You're comfortable here.

21:30.149 --> 21:32.149
Hardly.

21:32.151 --> 21:34.918
You know the
place, though.

21:34.920 --> 21:36.920
I guess.

21:36.922 --> 21:40.924
Yeah, it was my first
overseas posting. 2004.

21:40.926 --> 21:43.994
What was it like?

21:43.996 --> 21:45.629
Well, the Syrians were throwing
their weight around.

21:45.631 --> 21:47.765
There was a lot
of assassinations, truck bombs,

21:47.767 --> 21:50.668
hostage-takings.
It was... kind of scary.

21:50.670 --> 21:54.104
But let me guess,
you were not scared.

21:54.106 --> 21:56.507
Honestly, no.

21:56.509 --> 21:59.510
It-it was... a big adventure.

21:59.512 --> 22:02.112
But...

22:02.114 --> 22:04.682
I was different then.

22:04.684 --> 22:07.117
How?

22:07.119 --> 22:09.520
I was younger.

22:09.522 --> 22:13.924
And I was... alone.

22:17.863 --> 22:22.399
There wasn't anyone waiting
for me back at home.

22:46.692 --> 22:49.526
Ms. Sutton, sorry for the delay.

22:49.528 --> 22:51.195
I'm an American
citizen.

22:51.197 --> 22:53.030
You have no right to hold me.

22:53.032 --> 22:54.531
I want my lawyer.

22:55.968 --> 22:57.501
Did you hear me?

22:57.503 --> 22:58.902
I want my lawyer.

22:58.904 --> 23:01.905
I heard you.
You have a loud voice.

23:01.907 --> 23:05.075
The foreign residence act--
Section 54, paragraph 5A,

23:05.077 --> 23:07.244
relating to foreign nationals
who endanger the security

23:07.246 --> 23:09.046
of the Federal Republic
of Germany.

23:09.048 --> 23:11.014
I didn't endanger anything.
This is bullshit.

23:11.016 --> 23:13.417
It's the law.
We can hold you for 18 months,

23:13.419 --> 23:15.185
then deport you back
to the United States,

23:15.187 --> 23:17.721
where I'm sure the FBI wants
to question you also.

23:17.723 --> 23:20.491
I want my lawyer.

23:20.493 --> 23:23.093
Your source hacked
into a government database.

23:23.095 --> 23:24.661
That's a criminal act.

23:25.898 --> 23:27.331
Give me his name,
and you can go.

23:27.333 --> 23:28.999
I don't know his name
or her name.

23:29.001 --> 23:30.267
Even if I did,

23:30.269 --> 23:31.568
I wouldn't tell you.

23:31.570 --> 23:33.904
Journalists protect
their sources.

23:33.906 --> 23:36.607
Are you in possession
of the rest of the documents?

23:36.609 --> 23:37.875
You must know.

23:37.877 --> 23:40.377
You searched my apartment.

23:40.379 --> 23:42.579
Laura,

23:42.581 --> 23:44.515
do you understand the situation
we're in here?

23:44.517 --> 23:48.585
Yeah. You're in the shit
because you broke your own laws.

23:48.587 --> 23:52.356
700 German citizens
have gone to Syria

23:52.358 --> 23:54.558
to fight for the Islamic State.

23:54.560 --> 23:57.194
It's not what they're doing
over there that scares us.

23:57.196 --> 23:59.596
It's what happens
when they come back.

23:59.598 --> 24:01.398
We were tracking them.

24:01.400 --> 24:03.066
We'd made some arrests,
prevented some plots,

24:03.068 --> 24:05.969
but now those we arrested
must be released.

24:05.971 --> 24:08.372
Those we were tracking,
we've lost.

24:08.374 --> 24:10.374
They vanished.
So how will you feel

24:10.376 --> 24:12.443
when bombs start going
off in Berlin, Paris,

24:12.445 --> 24:14.144
Brussels.
Do you want that?

24:14.146 --> 24:16.447
- Of course not.
- But you made it more likely.

24:18.050 --> 24:20.751
You have legal ways
to track these people.

24:20.753 --> 24:22.553
Legal ways...

24:22.555 --> 24:24.588
that demand resources
we do not have.

24:24.590 --> 24:28.625
Yet you sent five men
to arrest me today.

24:28.627 --> 24:30.561
Five.

24:30.563 --> 24:32.129
Wouldn't they have been better
employed tracking these wannabe

24:32.131 --> 24:34.231
terrorists who are supposed
to be blowing up Europe?

24:34.233 --> 24:36.767
- Do you want to make a joke of this?
- You got caught

24:36.769 --> 24:38.735
breaking the law.
You try to make it

24:38.737 --> 24:40.571
about something else,
like the terrorist threat,

24:40.573 --> 24:42.606
which is what you always do.

24:42.608 --> 24:45.509
You're not allowed to spy
on your own citizens.

24:45.511 --> 24:47.010
It's against the law.

24:47.012 --> 24:49.146
It's against the fucking law.

24:49.148 --> 24:51.014
That woman.

24:51.016 --> 24:52.983
She'd let the country burn
as long as she

24:52.985 --> 24:55.319
got her Pulitzer prize.

24:56.322 --> 24:57.754
Hmm.

24:57.756 --> 24:59.990
What's up?

24:59.992 --> 25:01.692
Apart from the obvious.

25:01.694 --> 25:05.629
Had a meeting
with BND top brass,

25:05.631 --> 25:07.798
including Herr Mohr.

25:07.800 --> 25:09.032
He flew in from Cologne?

25:09.034 --> 25:10.767
Chancellery's on the warpath.

25:10.769 --> 25:12.436
No shit.

25:12.438 --> 25:15.839
There's already talk
of a parliamentary inquiry.

25:15.841 --> 25:18.542
They want a scalp.

25:18.544 --> 25:20.844
Not Astrid, I hope. She's
one of the good guys.

25:20.846 --> 25:23.514
No.

25:25.117 --> 25:26.850
Who, then?

25:26.852 --> 25:29.953
Someone from our side.

25:29.955 --> 25:32.022
Someone senior.

25:32.024 --> 25:34.525
Who, Saul?

25:41.467 --> 25:43.734
You've got to be kidding me.

25:43.736 --> 25:46.837
I'm afraid not.

25:46.839 --> 25:50.274
Giving you 24 hours
to leave the country.

25:51.810 --> 25:53.310
I know it's not fair.

25:53.312 --> 25:54.811
Well, what did you say?

25:54.813 --> 25:56.647
Wasn't really
a conversation.

25:56.649 --> 25:57.981
Have you spoken to the Director?

25:57.983 --> 26:00.217
He's not inclined
to put up a fight.

26:00.219 --> 26:01.351
Not inclined?

26:01.353 --> 26:03.253
Flat-out refused.

26:04.990 --> 26:08.392
I don't believe this.
I do not fucking believe this.

26:11.997 --> 26:13.730
Hey, you.

26:13.732 --> 26:15.732
Hey, yourself.

26:15.734 --> 26:17.501
Is Franny still awake?

26:17.503 --> 26:20.404
Just fell asleep.
Shall I wake her?

26:20.406 --> 26:22.940
No. No, no, that's okay.

26:22.942 --> 26:24.708
I'll be...

26:24.710 --> 26:27.578
I'll be home tomorrow.

26:30.249 --> 26:32.549
Listen, I can't tell you
how much it means to me

26:32.551 --> 26:34.418
that you're there with her,
looking after her.

26:34.420 --> 26:36.086
Don't be silly.

26:36.088 --> 26:38.121
No, seriously.

26:38.123 --> 26:40.090
I've never had that before.

26:40.092 --> 26:43.927
Well, don't give it a second
thought. We're having fun.

26:43.929 --> 26:45.596
How are you?

26:47.266 --> 26:49.466
Good. Yeah. Um...

26:49.468 --> 26:51.868
We're all set
for the big day tomorrow.

26:51.870 --> 26:53.136
And you're being careful.

26:53.138 --> 26:55.772
Very. I'm hiding behind a team

26:55.774 --> 26:59.309
of hunky
ex-special forces guys.

26:59.311 --> 27:00.978
I like the sound of that.

27:00.980 --> 27:04.047
Of you hiding,
not-not the special forces guys.

27:07.820 --> 27:10.253
I miss you.

27:10.255 --> 27:12.155
Miss you, too.

27:39.485 --> 27:41.551
- Demet.
- Hello.

27:42.988 --> 27:44.388
_

27:44.389 --> 27:46.639
_

27:46.640 --> 27:47.820
_

27:47.926 --> 27:49.059
<i>- Ja.</i>
<i>- Gut.</i>

27:49.060 --> 27:50.527
_

27:50.528 --> 27:52.325
_

27:52.326 --> 27:53.898
_

27:53.933 --> 27:54.731
Okay.

27:54.732 --> 27:56.682
_

27:56.683 --> 27:58.431
_

27:58.466 --> 27:59.069
<i>Sehr gut.</i>

27:59.070 --> 28:00.693
_

28:02.007 --> 28:03.340
Fatima.

28:03.341 --> 28:06.427
_

28:10.180 --> 28:11.783
_

28:11.784 --> 28:13.340
_

28:59.932 --> 29:01.932
Laura.

29:01.934 --> 29:04.000
I'm so sorry for this.

29:05.671 --> 29:07.938
Believe me, there'll be
repercussions.

29:07.940 --> 29:11.041
Your client enabled
a criminal act.

29:11.043 --> 29:12.542
She endangered
national security.

29:12.544 --> 29:14.177
We acted within the law.

29:14.179 --> 29:16.713
My client acted
as a responsible journalist.

29:16.715 --> 29:18.715
The only criminal act here
was the one she exposed,

29:18.717 --> 29:20.450
which is why the very first
judge I called

29:20.452 --> 29:21.918
ordered her release.

29:21.920 --> 29:23.286
You and your bosses
will hear about this.

29:23.288 --> 29:24.521
So will your client,

29:24.523 --> 29:26.790
if she publishes
any more documents.

29:26.792 --> 29:28.725
We'll put her on a plane
back to the States,

29:28.727 --> 29:30.694
and all the expensive lawyers
in the world won't stop us.

29:30.696 --> 29:33.196
Come on, let's get out
of this shit hole.

29:36.401 --> 29:39.202
<i>This camp, Alladia, is home</i>

29:39.204 --> 29:41.638
to 20,000 refugees.

29:41.640 --> 29:43.640
By the end
of next week,

29:43.642 --> 29:45.809
it will have 30,000,

29:45.811 --> 29:49.112
40,000, maybe more.

29:49.114 --> 29:51.481
There isn't the food
to feed these people,

29:51.483 --> 29:54.117
there are no roofs
to shelter them,

29:54.119 --> 29:55.485
there are
no doctors

29:55.487 --> 29:58.822
and nurses
to care for them.

29:58.824 --> 30:00.056
I promise

30:00.058 --> 30:02.459
we will provide
all these things.

30:02.461 --> 30:04.060
And we will make this camp

30:04.062 --> 30:05.962
a safe place for everyone

30:05.964 --> 30:08.064
escaping the terror of war.

30:08.066 --> 30:10.500
But let's try to do
more than this.

30:10.502 --> 30:13.937
Let's make Alladia not
an end but a beginning.

30:13.939 --> 30:17.274
A place where children
can go to school,

30:17.276 --> 30:19.976
where young men and women

30:19.978 --> 30:23.113
can learn a profession, a craft

30:23.115 --> 30:24.881
or an art.

30:26.919 --> 30:28.919
But there's no money for this.

30:28.921 --> 30:31.521
There's never money for this.

30:31.523 --> 30:34.591
Until today.

30:34.593 --> 30:38.028
Here's a check from the During
Foundation for $10 million.

30:41.166 --> 30:42.465
And...

30:42.467 --> 30:45.702
And this...
This is just the start.

30:51.710 --> 30:53.710
Because I call on my
fellow businessmen,

30:53.712 --> 30:55.212
on governments,

30:55.214 --> 30:57.147
on aid organizations,

30:57.149 --> 31:00.784
to fulfill this promise,
so that on the day

31:00.786 --> 31:01.885
when peace comes,

31:01.887 --> 31:05.689
you, the people of Alladia,

31:05.691 --> 31:07.157
can go home

31:07.159 --> 31:09.793
and rebuild your country
with pride

31:09.795 --> 31:11.962
and knowledge and skill.

31:11.964 --> 31:14.364
Thank you.

31:14.366 --> 31:15.932
Take care.

31:17.736 --> 31:19.469
Thanks a lot.

31:20.906 --> 31:22.706
Call Hamel. Get him to
bring the vehicles up.

31:22.708 --> 31:24.341
Roger-dodger.

31:24.343 --> 31:27.143
Guys, vehicles on standby.

31:28.547 --> 31:30.313
Thank you very much.

31:31.884 --> 31:33.450
- Thanks.
- Yes, sir.

31:41.927 --> 31:43.393
How was I?
I can never tell.

31:43.395 --> 31:45.195
One hour's up.
It's time to go.

31:45.197 --> 31:47.330
No, I need ten more minutes.

31:47.332 --> 31:49.399
To "press the flesh"--
isn't that the expression?

31:49.401 --> 31:50.734
Otto, it's time.

31:50.736 --> 31:51.935
For the cameras.
Ten more minutes.

31:51.937 --> 31:53.904
Then I'm all yours, okay?

31:53.906 --> 31:56.006
I promise.

31:56.008 --> 31:57.207
It's a pleasure, thank you.

31:57.209 --> 31:58.541
<i>What about the Ukraine?</i>

31:58.543 --> 31:59.843
Two of our assets
in Donetsk

31:59.845 --> 32:00.844
are potentially
compromised

32:00.846 --> 32:02.579
by the documents.

32:02.581 --> 32:04.414
One requested a relocation
to Western Europe.

32:04.416 --> 32:06.249
The other wants asylum
in the States.

32:06.251 --> 32:08.418
I'll get it approved.
Is the exfiltration underway?

32:08.420 --> 32:10.420
- They'll be at Ramstein by this evening.
- Good.

32:10.422 --> 32:12.522
Astrid called.
Laura Sutton's been released.

32:12.524 --> 32:14.591
Well, that was quick.

32:14.593 --> 32:17.093
We're all over her, though.
Three separate watcher teams

32:17.095 --> 32:19.029
- and six cars on drive-by.
- Good.

32:19.031 --> 32:21.798
- Listen, Saul.
- Not here, not here, not here.

32:21.800 --> 32:23.867
Come on.

32:28.640 --> 32:30.273
I heard what you said to Arthur

32:30.275 --> 32:32.409
about relocating
the Donetsk assets.

32:32.411 --> 32:34.945
- No choice. They're burned.
- You know I recruited them both.

32:34.947 --> 32:37.147
- Yes.
- And their loss makes us completely blind

32:37.149 --> 32:38.748
in Eastern Ukraine,
where World War III

32:38.750 --> 32:39.983
could break out any day.

32:39.985 --> 32:41.551
Well, you exaggerate,
but yes, I know.

32:41.553 --> 32:43.553
Then you also know
I'm the best person

32:43.555 --> 32:45.221
to find agents
to replace them.

32:45.223 --> 32:47.324
I have the contacts,
the experience.

32:47.326 --> 32:48.892
No one is disputing that.

32:48.894 --> 32:51.761
Then dispute the decision.
Explain that we suffered

32:51.763 --> 32:53.897
a major penetration here,

32:53.899 --> 32:56.633
one that endangers the security
of Europe and the United States,

32:56.635 --> 32:58.902
and I am the best
goddamn person to fix it.

32:58.904 --> 33:01.805
I told you, my hands are tied.

33:04.343 --> 33:07.377
If I were Carrie Mathison,
what would you be doing right now?

33:08.580 --> 33:10.680
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

33:12.684 --> 33:14.617
Exactly what I am doing.

33:14.619 --> 33:17.287
Bullshit.
The gloves would be off.

33:17.289 --> 33:19.022
You'd be protecting her
at all costs.

33:19.024 --> 33:20.423
No matter what she did.

33:20.425 --> 33:22.525
No matter how royally
she screwed up.

33:22.527 --> 33:25.795
- Not what I'd be do...
- Well, guess what. She's gone, Saul.

33:25.797 --> 33:27.664
So start showing
some fucking allegiance

33:27.666 --> 33:29.766
to the people who stuck around
to support you.

33:39.511 --> 33:41.978
Okay, one at a time, please.

33:41.980 --> 33:43.713
Thank you.
Thanks a lot.

33:43.715 --> 33:46.449
Thank you, thank you very much.
Of course,

33:46.451 --> 33:48.685
of course we will come back.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

33:48.687 --> 33:50.186
Let's take this one, hmm?

33:51.523 --> 33:52.822
Thank you.

33:52.824 --> 33:54.057
- Carrie.
- Thanks a lot. Thank you.

33:54.059 --> 33:56.059
Hamel, bring the
vehicles up. Otto,

33:56.061 --> 33:57.127
we need to leave.

33:57.129 --> 33:58.795
Yeah, all right.

33:58.797 --> 34:00.063
Uh, uh, I need to go.
I really need to go.

34:00.065 --> 34:02.399
Thank you very much.

34:02.401 --> 34:04.901
- Thank you very much. Thanks a lot.
- Please.

34:04.903 --> 34:07.637
Look at this boy.
He's eight years old.

34:07.639 --> 34:09.239
Not one day in
school, not ever.

34:09.241 --> 34:12.475
We need schools as much
as we need food, please.

34:12.476 --> 34:15.178
I know.
I know. Uh, of course.

34:15.179 --> 34:16.545
No, that-that's
for sure.

34:16.547 --> 34:19.649
Carrie.
Guy in the dark jacket.

34:22.219 --> 34:25.655
- Don't lose him. - Can you explain that
that's exactly what I've promised?

34:30.661 --> 34:33.396
Our first priority
is food and shelter.

34:33.398 --> 34:35.598
We do all we can.

34:35.600 --> 34:37.434
You, in the jacket!

34:37.436 --> 34:40.402
Get him to cover.
Get him to cover. Go.

34:44.443 --> 34:47.143
Show me your hands!
Show me your fucking hands!

34:49.781 --> 34:52.014
Let the woman go.

34:52.016 --> 34:54.717
Let her go.
Let her go.

34:54.719 --> 34:56.418
Take him.

34:59.558 --> 35:02.225
Into the vehicles.
Go, go!

35:02.227 --> 35:04.961
- Go!
- Go, go, go!

35:06.932 --> 35:09.766
Go, go. Move, move.

35:12.204 --> 35:14.204
Go.

35:14.206 --> 35:15.305
Go!

35:22.914 --> 35:24.881
Stay down.

35:37.796 --> 35:39.829
You see that?

35:41.399 --> 35:43.466
What the fuck?
Where is everybody?

35:48.507 --> 35:50.673
Stop.

35:52.511 --> 35:54.144
I said stop!

36:04.823 --> 36:06.523
Hamel, no!

36:40.192 --> 36:42.192
Come on,
let's get you out of here.

36:42.194 --> 36:44.294
I should make some calls first,
talk to the government.

36:44.296 --> 36:46.196
Otto, we need you
on that plane right now.

36:46.198 --> 36:47.463
You're still in danger.

36:47.465 --> 36:49.232
- Come on. Come on.
- Yeah.

36:49.234 --> 36:52.101
Yeah, okay.
Let's go home, then, huh?

36:56.141 --> 36:57.640
Not me.

36:57.642 --> 36:59.342
What?

36:59.344 --> 37:01.344
I'm not going.
I-I need to get a sense

37:01.346 --> 37:02.845
of what happened here today.

37:02.847 --> 37:04.547
We know what happened.
We stayed too long.

37:04.549 --> 37:06.316
- I don't think so.
- What do you mean?

37:06.318 --> 37:07.717
It was carefully
planned.

37:07.719 --> 37:09.219
They were gonna
hit us on our way

37:09.221 --> 37:11.221
out of the camp
no matter what.

37:11.223 --> 37:12.822
Wait a minute. You're not...
You're not thinking

37:12.824 --> 37:14.724
- of going back there, are you?
- I have to find out

37:14.726 --> 37:15.992
who's behind this,
whether they're gonna

37:15.994 --> 37:17.260
follow us to Berlin.

37:18.597 --> 37:20.196
- Come on, Carrie. This is...
- Don't worry.

37:20.198 --> 37:21.864
As soon as you leave,
all the attention

37:21.866 --> 37:24.033
will leave with you.
I can move around more easily.

37:24.035 --> 37:25.268
Plus, I'll have
plenty of backup.

37:25.270 --> 37:26.603
This is not a good idea.

37:26.605 --> 37:28.805
It's not a debate. I'm staying.

37:36.681 --> 37:39.682
You saved my life.

37:39.684 --> 37:41.951
I won't forget.

38:18.757 --> 38:22.825
Oh, please,
please, God, help me.

39:47.312 --> 39:51.414
Gray Renault van, license
Bravo-Charlie-Victor-7758.

39:51.416 --> 39:54.183
Heading south on the 13
from Steinwald Rasthof.

39:54.185 --> 39:56.319
Van contains one driver, male,

39:56.321 --> 39:58.888
three teenage
ISIL recruits, female.

40:30.889 --> 40:32.889
<i>Bitte.</i>

40:54.379 --> 40:56.379
I assume you've been
briefed on my situation here.

40:56.381 --> 40:57.647
Yeah, of course. _

40:57.649 --> 40:59.415
Well, I'm calling you personally

40:59.417 --> 41:01.784
to say it's a serious mistake.

41:01.786 --> 41:03.553
Don't overdramatize, Allison.

41:03.555 --> 41:05.888
Badge of honor,
taking one for the team.

41:05.890 --> 41:08.257
In the end,
it'll help your career.

41:08.259 --> 41:10.493
It will also set
our intelligence operations

41:10.495 --> 41:12.161
in Russia
and Eastern Europe back

41:12.163 --> 41:14.397
in ways we cannot
afford right now.

41:14.399 --> 41:18.067
I've been COS of Moscow,
Kiev and Berlin.

41:18.069 --> 41:20.470
You know how valuable I am.

41:22.440 --> 41:25.308
No one's doubting your value,

41:25.310 --> 41:28.411
but the Germans want a head
on a spike,

41:28.413 --> 41:29.946
an important head.

41:29.948 --> 41:32.381
So give them Saul's.

41:33.518 --> 41:34.951
I'm sorry?

41:34.953 --> 41:36.519
The Division Chief.

41:36.521 --> 41:38.688
That's important enough
for them, isn't it?

41:40.191 --> 41:42.959
You're suggesting
I recall Saul to Langley?

41:42.961 --> 41:44.694
No, just stop him coming
to Berlin.

41:44.696 --> 41:46.829
He can do his job from anywhere.

41:46.831 --> 41:49.365
Paris, London, Vienna.

41:49.367 --> 41:51.534
You know Saul would understand.

41:51.536 --> 41:54.070
He always puts the Agency first.

41:55.273 --> 41:56.973
And be honest.

41:56.975 --> 41:59.809
Who would you rather have
on the ground here,

41:59.811 --> 42:01.511
him or me?

43:20.892 --> 43:22.391
Jesus!

43:22.393 --> 43:24.326
I won't hurt you.

43:24.328 --> 43:26.061
What the hell
are you doing in here?

43:29.934 --> 43:32.334
- What is that?
- Your money.

43:32.336 --> 43:34.103
Al-Amin's orders.

43:34.105 --> 43:36.405
We gave our word
to protect you.

43:36.407 --> 43:38.207
We failed.

43:43.948 --> 43:45.948
What happened?

43:45.950 --> 43:47.183
- Waleed betrayed us.
- Waleed?

43:47.185 --> 43:49.351
- For money.
- Whose money? Who paid him?

43:51.989 --> 43:54.023
Behruz, who paid him?

43:54.025 --> 43:55.991
Look.

44:01.699 --> 44:04.166
Who paid you?

44:07.772 --> 44:10.806
Who paid you
to do it?

44:10.808 --> 44:13.108
- Enough. Just tell me what happened.
- He'll say.

44:13.110 --> 44:15.544
Listen.

44:18.649 --> 44:21.817
Why did they want
to kill During?

44:21.819 --> 44:23.385
Hmm?

44:23.387 --> 44:25.821
Why did they want
him dead?

44:25.823 --> 44:27.823
He was helping us.

44:27.825 --> 44:29.792
Why kill him?

44:29.794 --> 44:31.794
Say it in English!

44:31.796 --> 44:34.797
It wasn't him.

44:34.799 --> 44:37.466
It was the CIA woman.

44:37.468 --> 44:39.468
She was the target.

44:43.207 --> 44:46.041
Six hours
he was questioned.

44:46.043 --> 44:50.112
Whoever paid him, he was
more afraid of them than dying.

44:51.582 --> 44:54.483
Beirut is not safe
for you.

44:54.485 --> 44:57.653
