Let's see, Raj was the <i>kung pao</i> chicken.

00:03.620 --> 00:06.487
-I'm the dumplings.
-Yes, you are.

00:07.490 --> 00:09.355
Creepy, Howard.

00:09.526 --> 00:11.016
Creepy good or creepy bad?

00:12.429 --> 00:15.125
-Who was the shrimp with lobster sauce?
-That would be me.

00:15.298 --> 00:18.825
Come to papa, you un-kosher delight.

00:19.602 --> 00:22.036
I'm not necessarily talking to the food.

00:27.544 --> 00:29.171
Sit over there.

00:33.950 --> 00:35.679
Sit over there.

00:45.061 --> 00:47.359
-Baby wipe?
-Why do you have--?

00:47.530 --> 00:49.395
-No, don't ask.
-No, don't, don't.

00:50.600 --> 00:51.624
I'll tell you why.

00:53.069 --> 00:55.560
I had to sanitize my hands
because the university...

00:55.739 --> 00:58.867
...replaced the paper towels
in the restrooms with hot-air blowers.

00:59.042 --> 01:01.067
I thought the blowers were more sanitary.

01:01.244 --> 01:02.643
-Why?
-Really, don't.

01:03.012 --> 01:07.381
Hot-air blowers are incubators
and spewers of bacteria and pestilence.

01:07.550 --> 01:10.348
It'd be more hygienic
if they had a plague-infested gibbon...

01:10.520 --> 01:12.750
...sneeze my hands dry.

01:12.922 --> 01:16.187
Hey, guys,
I just got the most amazing new--

01:18.661 --> 01:22.324
Do you think you'll ever be able to talk
in front of me without being drunk?

01:25.168 --> 01:28.160
Okay, well, I'll just go eat by myself.

01:28.338 --> 01:30.238
-You don't have to do that.
-It's okay.

01:30.406 --> 01:33.603
Between him not talking,
him talking, and him...

01:35.845 --> 01:37.642
...l'm better off alone.

01:37.814 --> 01:40.214
So goodbye, you poor, strange little man.

01:44.954 --> 01:47.821
-She's so considerate.
-So, what's your news?

01:47.991 --> 01:50.789
Remember that little object
I spotted beyond the Kuiper belt?

01:50.960 --> 01:53.019
Oh, yeah, 2008-NQ sub-17.

01:53.196 --> 01:56.131
Or as I call it, Planet Bollywood.

01:56.566 --> 01:58.158
Anyway, because of my discovery...

01:58.334 --> 02:01.770
<i>...People Magazine</i> is naming me
one of their 30 Under 30 to Watch.

02:01.938 --> 02:04.907
-Raj, that's incredible.
-Congratulations.

02:05.074 --> 02:10.410
Excuse me, 30 what under 30 what
to watch what?

02:10.814 --> 02:13.248
Thirty visionaries
under 30 years of age to watch...

02:13.416 --> 02:16.613
...as they challenge
the preconceptions of the fields.

02:16.786 --> 02:19.778
If I had a million guesses,
I never would have gotten that.

02:20.890 --> 02:24.257
They've got me in with a guy doing
something about hunger in Indonesia...

02:24.427 --> 02:27.487
...a psychotherapist using dolphins
to rehabilitate prisoners...

02:27.664 --> 02:32.294
...and Ellen Page,
star of the charming independent film <i>Juno.</i>

02:32.735 --> 02:35.533
Oh, I'd so do her.

02:41.311 --> 02:44.178
...for designing the telescope camera
mounting bracket?

02:44.347 --> 02:47.407
Sorry, it's not part of my heartwarming
and personal narrative...

02:47.584 --> 02:49.745
...in which a humble boy
from New Delhi...

02:49.919 --> 02:54.322
...overcame poverty and prejudice and
journeyed to America to reach for the stars.

02:54.490 --> 02:58.085
Poverty? Your father's a gynecologist.
He drives a Bentley.

02:59.062 --> 03:00.427
It's a lease.

03:03.600 --> 03:07.536
I'm confused. Was there
some sort of peer-review committee...

03:07.704 --> 03:10.036
...to determine which scientists
would be included?

03:10.206 --> 03:13.937
Peer review? It's <i>People Magazine.</i>
People picked me.

03:14.377 --> 03:17.175
-What people?
-The people from <i>People.</i>

03:17.347 --> 03:19.781
What? Yeah, but exactly
who are these people?

03:19.949 --> 03:22.611
What are their credentials?
How are they qualified?

03:22.785 --> 03:25.185
What makes accidentally noticing
a hunk of rock...

03:25.355 --> 03:28.256
...traipsing around the solar system
for billions of years...

03:28.424 --> 03:33.157
...more noteworthy than any other scientific
accomplishment by someone under 30?

03:33.630 --> 03:37.066
Boy, I'll bet Ellen Page's friends
aren't giving her this kind of crap.

03:42.505 --> 03:43.631
You proud of yourself?

03:44.807 --> 03:46.968
In general, yes.

04:15.338 --> 04:18.101
Oh, there's my missing neutrino.

04:18.274 --> 04:20.742
You were hiding from me
as an unbalanced charge...

04:20.910 --> 04:23.743
...weren't you,
you little subatomic dickens?

04:24.681 --> 04:27.514
-Hi, Sheldon.
-Hey, look, I found my missing neutrino.

04:27.684 --> 04:30.278
Oh, good,
we can take it off the milk carton.

04:32.021 --> 04:34.353
We're gonna apologize
and invite Raj out to dinner.

04:34.524 --> 04:36.355
Apologize? For what?

04:36.526 --> 04:40.724
He came over last night with some pretty
good news and we weren't very supportive.

04:41.898 --> 04:44.298
I sense you're trying
to tell me something.

04:44.867 --> 04:47.995
You were a colossal asshat.

04:48.538 --> 04:51.735
Oh, no, I beg to differ.

04:51.908 --> 04:54.376
Of the three of us,
I was by far the most supportive.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.205
Really? Do tell.

04:56.379 --> 05:00.042
How will Raj ever reach true greatness
if his friends lower the bar for him?

05:00.483 --> 05:04.681
When I was 11, my sister bought our father
a "world's greatest dad" coffee mug.

05:04.854 --> 05:08.017
And frankly, the man coasted
until the day he died.

05:09.525 --> 05:10.992
Okay, let's try it this way.

05:11.160 --> 05:14.425
What if this <i>People Magazine</i> thing
is the best Raj is going to achieve?

05:16.165 --> 05:19.134
-I had not considered that.
-Mm-hm. Come on.

05:19.535 --> 05:22.265
I often forget
other people have limitations.

05:22.438 --> 05:24.463
It's so sad.

05:24.974 --> 05:27.568
-He can feel sadness?
-Not really.

05:27.744 --> 05:29.769
It's what you and I call condescension.

05:31.581 --> 05:34.675
Now, when we go in there,
let's show Raj that we're happy for him.

05:34.851 --> 05:36.580
But I'm not.

05:37.987 --> 05:40.046
Well, then fake it.
Look at me.

05:40.223 --> 05:43.818
I could be grinding on the fact that
without my stabilizing telescope mount...

05:43.993 --> 05:48.089
...he never would have found
that stupid little clump of cosmic schmutz.

05:49.932 --> 05:51.763
But I'm bigger than that.

05:52.201 --> 05:53.930
Fine. What do you want me to do?

05:54.537 --> 05:55.799
Smile.

06:03.446 --> 06:07.041
Oh, crap, that's terrifying.

06:08.785 --> 06:11.117
We're here to see Koothrappali,
not kill Batman.

06:13.122 --> 06:15.386
Try less teeth.

06:20.229 --> 06:22.527
Close enough. Come on.

06:24.500 --> 06:26.661
-Hey, Raj.
-Hey, guys. What's up?

06:26.836 --> 06:28.963
We wanted to invite you
out to dinner tonight.

06:29.138 --> 06:33.234
Celebrate your 30 Under 30 thing.
Right, Sheldon?

06:36.813 --> 06:39.509
-It's very nice of you. I would like that.
-Hello, boys.

06:39.682 --> 06:41.343
-Dr. Gablehauser.
-Dr. Koothrappali.

06:41.517 --> 06:43.041
-Dr. Gablehauser.
-Dr. Hofstadter.

06:43.219 --> 06:44.550
-Dr. Gablehauser.
-Dr. Cooper.

06:44.720 --> 06:47.848
-Dr. Gablehauser.
-Mr. Wolowitz.

06:48.658 --> 06:52.856
Boys, I've got a question for you.
Who in this room discovered a star?

06:53.029 --> 06:55.896
Actually, 2008-NQ sub-17
is a planetary body.

06:56.065 --> 06:58.260
I'm not talking about you,
I'm talking about me.

06:58.434 --> 07:03.098
You, my exotic young friend, are my star.

07:03.272 --> 07:06.139
But you didn't discover him.
You merely noticed he was here...

07:06.309 --> 07:08.971
...much like he did with 2008-NQ sub-17.

07:09.145 --> 07:11.909
-Sheldon.
-Ugh. Sorry.

07:14.650 --> 07:18.848
Well, we gotta get you into a better office.
Something more suited to your status.

07:19.021 --> 07:22.252
-You don't have to go to trouble.
-How about von Gerlach's old office?

07:22.425 --> 07:25.519
-I'd rather have Fishbein's. It's bigger.
GABLEHAUSER: Done.

07:25.695 --> 07:27.686
Wait, I called dibs on Fishbein's office...

07:27.864 --> 07:31.265
...the day he started showing up at work
in his bathrobe.

07:31.434 --> 07:34.426
He gets a new office, I can't get
paper towels in the mens' room?

07:34.604 --> 07:37.334
-Sheldon.
-Damn, this is hard.

07:44.147 --> 07:47.207
Let me ask you, what do you think
the business of this place is?

[WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY]

07:53.656 --> 07:54.748
-Science?
-Money.

07:54.924 --> 07:56.516
Told you.

07:56.993 --> 07:59.518
And this boy's picture
in <i>People Magazine...</i>

07:59.695 --> 08:02.220
...is gonna raise us
a pile of money taller than--

08:02.999 --> 08:04.728
Well, taller than you.

08:06.502 --> 08:09.767
-I have a Master's degree.
-Who doesn't?

08:11.307 --> 08:14.674
Dr. Koothrappali, have you ever had lunch
in the president's dining room?

08:14.844 --> 08:17.369
I didn't even know
there was a president's dining room.

08:17.547 --> 08:20.107
It's the same food as the cafeteria,
only fresh.

08:20.283 --> 08:22.342
-Come on, little buddy.
-Okay, big buddy.

08:22.518 --> 08:24.452
See you tonight, guys.

08:27.256 --> 08:29.747
-You can stop smiling now.
-Ah.

08:32.195 --> 08:34.755
So anyway, after a fantastic lunch...

08:34.931 --> 08:37.365
...I was whisked
to the <i>People Magazine</i> photo shoot--

08:37.533 --> 08:39.558
-Have any of you been to a photo shoot?
HOWARD: No.

08:39.735 --> 08:41.498
It's fantastic.

08:41.904 --> 08:45.431
Apparently, the camera loves me,
and I, it.

08:46.175 --> 08:51.272
They shot me in front of a starry
background where I posed like this:

08:56.152 --> 08:58.120
They're going to digitally add
a supernova.

08:58.287 --> 09:01.279
They say it's the perfect metaphor
for my incandescent talent.

09:01.457 --> 09:06.485
Right, a ball of hot, flaming gas
that collapses upon itself.

Excuse me. Oh, it's my assistant, Trevor.

09:10.499 --> 09:12.126
Go for Koothrappali. Uh-huh.

09:12.535 --> 09:14.127
They gave him an assistant?

09:14.303 --> 09:18.205
If I want a new pen,
I have to go to the bank with wire cutters.

09:18.908 --> 09:21.172
Have we at this point
met our social obligations?

09:21.344 --> 09:22.402
Not yet.

09:22.578 --> 09:26.014
Okay, put it on my calendar but start
thinking of a reason why I can't go.

09:26.182 --> 09:28.673
Alrighty? Koothrappali out.

09:28.951 --> 09:29.975
God bless that boy.

09:30.152 --> 09:33.383
-Don't know what I'd do without him.
-You just got him this afternoon.

09:33.556 --> 09:36.548
Yes, but I'm finding
that having a lackey suits me.

09:37.526 --> 09:39.960
-A lackey?
-I'm sorry, is that politically incorrect?

09:40.129 --> 09:42.791
In India, we just call them untouchables.

09:43.733 --> 09:45.826
-Now?
-Almost.

09:46.002 --> 09:49.062
Speaking of untouchables,
I've got great news for you guys.

09:50.906 --> 09:54.933
<i>People Magazine</i> is having a reception
Saturday, and I managed to get you invited.

09:55.111 --> 09:57.671
-Oh, gee, thanks.
-Oh, you're welcome.

09:57.847 --> 10:00.281
Of course, I couldn't get you
into the VIP section...

10:00.449 --> 10:05.443
...because, you know, that's for VIPs,
and you guys are just, you know, P's.

10:06.722 --> 10:08.917
There's a tribe in Papua New Guinea...

10:09.091 --> 10:12.549
...where when a hunter flaunts his success
to the rest of the village...

10:12.728 --> 10:16.858
...they kill him and drive away evil spirits
with a drum made of his skin.

10:17.033 --> 10:21.527
Superstitious nonsense, of course,
but one can see their point.

10:28.210 --> 10:31.111
Here you go, Raj.
You might wanna drink this one slowly.

10:31.280 --> 10:34.545
Okay. So Saturday night,
can I count on my posse?

10:34.717 --> 10:37.914
Gee, I'd love to, Raj, but I can't make it.

10:38.087 --> 10:39.486
Oh, okay. Leonard?

10:40.222 --> 10:41.746
Well, uh....

No, I could-- No.

-I can make it, but I won't.

-The reception for my article on Saturday.

10:54.203 --> 10:55.227
You guys aren't going?

10:56.405 --> 10:59.533
I can't believe you. Raj is celebrating
a tremendous accomplishment.

10:59.709 --> 11:01.176
You're not gonna be there?

11:01.344 --> 11:04.802
A tremendous accomplishment would be
if the planetary body he discovered...

11:04.980 --> 11:08.279
...were plummeting toward Earth
and he exploded it with his mind.

11:09.919 --> 11:12.752
That would be cool.
I'd go to that reception.

Come on, this is huge.
Raj is gonna be in <i>People Magazine...</i>

11:16.258 --> 11:19.591
...and he didn't even have to knock up
one of the Spears sisters.

11:20.496 --> 11:22.555
Would you like to go with me?

11:22.732 --> 11:24.791
Of course I would. I would be honored.

-Now.

11:49.225 --> 11:51.921
Yeah, call me when you're on the cover.

12:02.905 --> 12:04.668
Oh, Raj, look at you.

12:04.840 --> 12:09.368
I know. I'm resplendent
like the noonday sun, am I not?

12:10.379 --> 12:13.815
Um, yeah. Starting with the champagne
a little early, aren't you?

12:13.983 --> 12:16.816
It was in the limo.
They sent a limo. I have a limo.

13:29.058 --> 13:33.290
There are hundreds of Croatian women
just waiting for you to contact them.

I'll lend you my username.
It's Wealthy Big Penis.

13:44.006 --> 13:46.474
-You're joking.
-You gotta make it easy for them.

13:46.642 --> 13:48.803
They're just learning English.

13:49.645 --> 13:50.737

13:50.913 --> 13:53.074
You're just gonna
sit around here and mope...

13:53.249 --> 13:57.015
...while Penny is out with Dr. Apu
from the Kwik-E-Mart?

13:57.419 --> 14:00.149
It's not a date and that's racist.

14:00.322 --> 14:04.656
It can't be racist.
He's a beloved character on <i>The Simpsons.</i>

14:05.594 --> 14:07.391
Let's just eat so I can get to bed.

14:07.563 --> 14:11.431
With any luck, tonight will be the night
my sleep apnea kills me.

14:15.237 --> 14:17.705
Did you ask for the chicken to be diced,
not shredded?

14:17.873 --> 14:20.034
-Yes.
-Even though the menu specifies shredded?

14:20.209 --> 14:22.040
-Yes.
-Brown rice, not white?

14:22.211 --> 14:24.645
Stop at the Korean grocery
and get the hot mustard?

14:24.813 --> 14:27.008
-Did you pick up the low-sodium soy sauce?
-Yes.

14:27.182 --> 14:29.013
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

14:30.519 --> 14:31.645
What took you so long?

14:33.556 --> 14:36.525
-Just sit down and eat.
-Fine.

14:39.628 --> 14:42.188
All right, it's shredded.
What do you want me to do?

14:42.364 --> 14:44.559
I want you to check
before you accept the order.

14:44.733 --> 14:46.325
Sorry.

14:47.236 --> 14:48.965
Were you distracted
by the possibility

14:49.138 --> 14:51.971
Koothrappali might have intercourse
with Penny tonight?

14:54.543 --> 14:56.636
He's not going to have intercourse
with Penny.

14:56.812 --> 14:58.746
Then there's no excuse for this chicken.

15:00.816 --> 15:05.810
You know, this situation with Koothrappali
brings to mind a story from my childhood.

15:05.988 --> 15:08.889
Oh, goody,
more tales from the panhandle.

15:09.058 --> 15:12.186
That's Northwest Texas.
I'm from East Texas, the Gulf region.

15:12.361 --> 15:15.159
Home to many Vietnamese shrimpers.

15:15.664 --> 15:17.825
Do the shrimpers feature in your story?

15:18.901 --> 15:20.334
No.

15:21.103 --> 15:23.469
Anyway, when I was 8...

15:23.639 --> 15:28.338
...a Montgomery Ward delivery van
ran over our family cat, Lucky.

15:29.812 --> 15:31.677
-Lucky?
-Yes, Lucky.

15:31.847 --> 15:34.509
He's irony impaired. Just move on.

15:35.250 --> 15:38.117
Okay, dead cat named Lucky. Continue.

15:38.287 --> 15:39.914
While others mourned Lucky...

15:40.089 --> 15:44.389
...I realized his untimely demise provided me
with the opportunity to replace him...

15:44.560 --> 15:46.858
...with something
more suited to my pet needs.

15:47.029 --> 15:49.691
A faithful companion
that I could snuggle with at night...

15:49.865 --> 15:53.801
...yet would be capable of killing
upon telepathic command.

15:55.671 --> 15:57.901
So not a puppy?

15:58.140 --> 15:59.903
Please. No, nothing so pedestrian.

16:00.075 --> 16:02.703
I wanted a griffin.

16:03.612 --> 16:07.378
-A griffin?
-Yes, half eagle, half lion.

16:08.183 --> 16:10.549
And mythological.

16:11.353 --> 16:12.718
Irrelevant.

16:13.555 --> 16:15.819
Yeah, I was studying
recombinant DNA technology...

16:15.991 --> 16:18.050
...and I was confidant
I could create one...

16:18.227 --> 16:22.960
...but my parents were unwilling to secure
the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.231
Of course, my sister got swimming lessons
when she wanted them.

16:30.673 --> 16:36.009
Sheldon, not that we don't all enjoy
a good lion-semen story, but--

16:36.578 --> 16:37.636
What's your point?

16:37.813 --> 16:43.274
My point is, if Koothrappali is moving on
to a new life of shallow, undeserved fame...

16:43.452 --> 16:47.081
...then perhaps this is an opportunity
to create a better cohort.

16:47.556 --> 16:50.252
You wanna breed a new friend?

16:51.160 --> 16:53.355
That's one option, but who has the time?

16:54.029 --> 16:55.291
But consider this.

16:55.464 --> 16:59.025
The Japanese, they're doing some
wonderful work with artificial intelligence.

16:59.201 --> 17:03.399
Now, combine that with some animatronics
from the imagineers over at Disney.

17:03.572 --> 17:08.202
Next thing you know, we're playing Halo
with a multilingual Abraham Lincoln.

17:08.844 --> 17:12.439
Sheldon, don't take this the wrong way,
but you're insane.

17:13.382 --> 17:17.443
That may well be, but the fact is it
wouldn't kill us to meet some new people.

17:17.618 --> 17:20.520
For the record,
it could kill us to meet new people.

17:22.156 --> 17:26.150
They could be murderers
or the carriers of unusual pathogens.

17:26.662 --> 17:30.120
And I'm not insane.
My mother had me tested.

17:33.569 --> 17:36.402
If we do get a new friend,
he should be a guy you can trust.

17:36.572 --> 17:38.369
You know, a guy who has your back.

17:38.540 --> 17:42.203
He should have money, live in a cool
place by the beach where we throw parties.

17:42.377 --> 17:46.575
-He should share our love of technology.
-And he should know a lot of women.

17:46.882 --> 17:49.942
Okay, let's see, money, women, technology.
Okay, we're agreed.

17:50.119 --> 17:53.714
Our new friend is going to be Iron Man.

How are you? I'm not drunk.

Mommy, Daddy, I want you to meet
my new squeeze, Penny.

I am not your squeeze.
There is no squeezing.

18:40.302 --> 18:42.770
<i>I can't see her. Center her in the frame.</i>

<i>So she's not Indian.</i>
<i>The boy's sowing some wild oats.</i>

18:50.679 --> 18:54.080
No, no, no, there's no sowing,
no squeezing and no sucking face.

a child and I will not be spoken to like one.

I have to go throw up.

PENNY: I don't know.

19:25.480 --> 19:28.074
