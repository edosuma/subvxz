00:01.281 --> 00:04.375
<i>Previously on</i> Stargate SG-1.

00:04.451 --> 00:07.477
- Who are you people?
- We are Replicators.

00:07.554 --> 00:10.523
- The others will destroy me.
- Not if you came with us.

00:10.590 --> 00:13.991
- You would do that?
- <i>They won't leave me. She promised.</i>

00:14.061 --> 00:16.723
No, my son.
They've made a fool of you.

00:19.633 --> 00:21.999
I have been relieved of command.

00:22.069 --> 00:25.004
- Who's replacing you, sir?
- Her name is Dr. Elizabeth Weir.

00:25.072 --> 00:28.166
- A civilian?
- An expert on international politics.

00:28.241 --> 00:30.368
Terra... Atlantis.

00:30.444 --> 00:33.743
Are you saying
the lost city of the Ancients is here?

00:33.814 --> 00:37.409
<i>The city we've been looking for</i>
<i>is under the ice of Antarctica.</i>

00:42.155 --> 00:43.349
Good-bye.

01:04.578 --> 01:06.944
- Dr. Weir.
- Elizabeth.

01:07.013 --> 01:09.675
Elizabeth. Almost ready.
I can't believe we're finally going.

01:09.750 --> 01:12.014
I mean, I know I should've been ready
a long time ago, but I needed some-

01:12.085 --> 01:13.882
The talks have stalled again.

01:16.590 --> 01:20.287
- You're kidding me.
- It's a complicated situation.

01:21.495 --> 01:24.828
The Antarctic Treaty was established to
promote scientific research in the area.

01:24.898 --> 01:27.492
With the interest of progress
for all mankind...

01:27.567 --> 01:29.660
not just that
of the United States.

01:29.736 --> 01:33.900
And so argue the other 11 nations
all claiming shared jurisdiction.

01:33.974 --> 01:36.738
I mean, Article One states quite clearly
there can be no establishment...

01:36.810 --> 01:40.576
of any military base
and no testing of any weapons.

01:40.647 --> 01:43.844
You saw firsthand
how powerful the Ancient outpost is.

01:43.917 --> 01:46.317
So meanwhile, Jack just stays frozen
in a stasis pod down there?

01:46.386 --> 01:50.982
He sacrificed himself to save us,
all of us, not just this country.

01:51.057 --> 01:56.893
I know, but the scale of Anubis's attack
makes covering it up tenuous at best.

01:57.664 --> 01:59.598
If we're gonna keep the entire world
from finding out...

01:59.666 --> 02:02.328
everything to do with the Stargate,
we're gonna need the full cooperation...

02:02.402 --> 02:05.735
of every government now aware
of what's been going on.

02:05.806 --> 02:08.240
- It's gonna take more time.
- In the meantime...

02:08.308 --> 02:10.105
we just sit here
and do nothing?

02:12.145 --> 02:16.479
- I'm sorry, Dr. Jackson.
- Daniel.

02:18.385 --> 02:20.080
Daniel.

03:31.057 --> 03:35.084
- Why can't we use the gate?
- It's not that we can't use it.

03:35.161 --> 03:39.222
Officially, all normal gate activity
will remain suspended just until...

03:40.367 --> 03:41.664
the agreement for control
of the Antarctic site is resolved.

03:41.735 --> 03:44.397
What does one have to do
with the other?

03:44.471 --> 03:48.874
Well, we obviously still have full
jurisdictional control over the Stargate.

03:48.942 --> 03:50.739
The president feels that, ultimately,
how we proceed...

03:50.810 --> 03:54.712
with operations here at SGC will
reflect on our international goodwill.

03:54.781 --> 03:57.614
In other words, it's our
political leverage in negotiations.

03:58.985 --> 04:00.782
I would never say that.

04:02.122 --> 04:04.022
What about Colonel O'Neill?

04:05.659 --> 04:08.321
Look, I know what he means
to the three of you.

04:08.395 --> 04:11.728
We all appreciate the sacrifice
Colonel O'Neill made.

04:11.798 --> 04:15.256
The Asgard can help him.
Last time, they were able...

04:15.335 --> 04:17.269
to erase the Ancient knowledge
from his mind before it killed him.

04:17.337 --> 04:20.306
We've tried contacting them.
What do you suggest we do?

04:20.373 --> 04:22.864
You're aware of how we helped
the Asgard trap the Replicators...

04:22.943 --> 04:25.036
in a time-dilation field
on the planet Hala?

04:25.111 --> 04:28.137
Something to that effect.
That was a couple of years ago, right?

04:28.214 --> 04:31.775
Basically, we know that that trap
is only gonna hold them for so long.

04:31.851 --> 04:34.820
Thor and the Asgard
must be monitoring the situation.

04:34.888 --> 04:37.448
If we can get there,
we should be able to contact them.

04:38.425 --> 04:40.825
Isn't the planet you're talking about
in another galaxy?

04:40.894 --> 04:42.987
- Othala.
- O'Neill used his knowledge...

04:43.063 --> 04:45.964
of the Ancients to modify the Goa'uld
vessel currently in our possession.

04:47.033 --> 04:49.558
According to your report,
Major, that ship is capable...

04:49.636 --> 04:52.332
of flying faster and farther
than anything the Goa'uld have.

04:52.405 --> 04:56.000
Yes. I think it might
just get us there.

04:56.076 --> 05:00.513
- And back?
- That may be a problem.

05:00.580 --> 05:02.571
There's a good chance
the trip will burn out the engines.

05:02.649 --> 05:04.583
Okay. That's a big problem.

05:04.651 --> 05:07.620
If you get there, and it turns out
you can't contact the Asgard-

05:07.687 --> 05:10.656
We're willing to take the risk.

05:12.125 --> 05:15.959
As admirable as that is,
I can't let you do it.

05:17.397 --> 05:19.695
For what reason?

05:19.766 --> 05:22.200
Colonel O'Neill was able
to fend off Anubis's fleet...

05:22.268 --> 05:24.566
using the weapons
from the Ancient outpost.

05:24.638 --> 05:27.038
Hopefully, that will make
the other Goa'uld think twice...

05:27.107 --> 05:29.667
before attacking Earth
in the foreseeable future.

05:29.743 --> 05:33.702
But the truth is, we don't know if we're
gonna be able to use those weapons again.

05:33.780 --> 05:37.739
And if we can't, we're gonna need
a new tactical advantage over the Goa'uld.

05:37.817 --> 05:40.650
At least that's what the Pentagon
tells me. The modified cargo ship...

05:40.720 --> 05:42.984
it's too valuable right now.

05:43.056 --> 05:46.219
I'm sorry.
Request denied.

06:09.549 --> 06:12.609
What can I do for you,
Major?

06:12.686 --> 06:14.711
I want you
to reconsider my request.

06:17.857 --> 06:19.586
I'm sorry.

06:20.660 --> 06:24.357
That cargo ship was modified
using the knowledge of the Ancients.

06:24.431 --> 06:28.424
There is no guarantee that anyone will
be able to figure out how it was done.

06:30.970 --> 06:34.633
And as the most likely person
on the planet to figure it out...

06:34.708 --> 06:37.700
are you saying that if I don't
let you attempt to contact the Asgard...

06:37.777 --> 06:39.768
you won't even try?

06:40.680 --> 06:42.944
I would never say that.

06:46.152 --> 06:50.179
Right now, that is the most
advanced piece of technology we have.

06:50.957 --> 06:53.949
If it weren't for Colonel O'Neill,
we wouldn't have that ship.

06:54.027 --> 06:56.587
For that matter, we wouldn't even
be here discussing this.

07:04.270 --> 07:06.067
We got the coordinates
from the <i>Prometheus.</i>

07:06.139 --> 07:07.902
Now, based on the amount of time
it took the modified ship...

07:07.974 --> 07:09.669
to get from Taonas to Earth...

07:09.743 --> 07:12.735
I'm estimating our trip
to Othala will take roughly 10 days.

07:14.914 --> 07:17.849
So, how'd you talk Weir
into letting us go?

07:18.852 --> 07:20.752
I didn't.

07:20.820 --> 07:24.881
I talked her into letting us go.
You're staying here.

07:27.360 --> 07:29.555
Daniel, even with the modifications
to the ship...

07:29.629 --> 07:31.426
there's no guarantee it'll get us there.

07:31.498 --> 07:33.932
And if it does, there's a good chance
it'll burn out the engines.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.798
The ship was never meant
to fly at that speed...

07:36.870 --> 07:40.067
which means if we don't
find the Asgard, we'll be stranded.

07:40.140 --> 07:44.770
- I know.
- We need you here.

07:44.844 --> 07:47.176
You're our best chance
at deciphering whatever information's...

07:47.247 --> 07:48.646
in that Ancient outpost.

07:48.715 --> 07:51.240
If we fail,
you will be O'Neill's only hope.

08:09.135 --> 08:12.901
Can I get you anything? I packed lots
of turkey. I know it's your favorite.

08:12.972 --> 08:15.770
Thank you,
but I am not currently hungry.

08:15.842 --> 08:18.868
Have you been able to determine
how O'Neill modified the engines?

08:18.945 --> 08:23.006
No. I'm just taking a break.
I didn't think it would be easy...

08:23.082 --> 08:26.381
but at least it's a good way
to pass the time.

08:27.453 --> 08:29.819
I'm sorry.
Have I been ignoring you?

08:33.059 --> 08:34.458
I am fine.

08:35.528 --> 08:39.862
I thought maybe working on the engines
would take my mind off Colonel O'Neill...

08:39.933 --> 08:43.061
which is kind of silly considering
he's the one who modified them.

08:47.240 --> 08:50.300
Look, I know this plan
isn't exactly foolproof.

08:50.376 --> 08:53.106
I have never plotted
an intergalactic course before.

08:53.179 --> 08:55.977
If the coordinates
are off by even one-half of a percent...

08:56.049 --> 08:59.280
we could wind up 10,000 light-years
from our destination.

09:03.356 --> 09:06.655
But still,
I'm trying to stay positive.

09:07.794 --> 09:09.921
I have the utmost confidence
in your ability.

09:09.996 --> 09:13.090
I know.

09:13.166 --> 09:16.067
- So, you wanna talk?
- Concerning what subject?

09:16.936 --> 09:19.461
I don't know. How's Rya'c?

09:19.539 --> 09:21.029
Fine.

09:23.176 --> 09:26.270
- You still keeping in touch with Ishta?
- Indeed.

09:27.447 --> 09:30.575
- Bra'tac?
- Bra'tac is well.

09:30.650 --> 09:34.279
- Come on, Teal'c. Throw me a bone here.
- How is Pete Shanahan?

09:35.588 --> 09:37.818
He's fine.

09:41.861 --> 09:45.558
- Is not all well between the two of you?
- No. Everything's great.

09:46.666 --> 09:49.362
It's just, as you well know...

09:49.435 --> 09:51.266
it's not easy saying good-bye
to someone you care about...

09:51.337 --> 09:54.431
when you think there's a chance
you may never see them again.

09:56.476 --> 09:59.707
I know that's a risk we take every time
we step through the Stargate, but-

10:02.215 --> 10:04.706
still, trying to stay positive.

10:08.021 --> 10:10.012
I'll get you a sandwich.

10:24.170 --> 10:26.502
I was just wondering
if you'd heard anything.

10:26.572 --> 10:29.769
They're still bogged down.

10:29.842 --> 10:32.367
- It's been over a week.
- What did you expect?

10:32.445 --> 10:35.312
Quick round of handshakes,
champagne toasts, seal the deal?

10:36.382 --> 10:38.942
We were attacked from space
by an armada of alien ships.

10:39.018 --> 10:41.612
If that doesn't get us past our distrust
of each other, what will?

10:42.655 --> 10:46.614
You forget those alien ships
were destroyed by a single weapon.

10:46.693 --> 10:48.661
That kind of power's gonna
give anyone cause for concern.

10:49.595 --> 10:52.120
Yeah. Not that I want this to come off
as an attempt to get rid of you...

10:52.198 --> 10:55.361
but isn't this sort
of international negotiation...

10:55.435 --> 10:57.300
exactly your area of expertise?

11:01.374 --> 11:04.104
<i>Unauthorized off-world activation!</i>

11:09.849 --> 11:11.976
We're receiving a signal.
It's a text message.

11:16.322 --> 11:19.450
- That's Goa'uld.
- What does it say?

11:19.525 --> 11:20.958
It's from one of the system lords-

11:21.027 --> 11:23.996
- Camulus, Celtic god of war.
- I'm not familiar with him.

11:24.964 --> 11:27.159
We've never had any contact
with him before.

11:29.469 --> 11:33.269
- Wow.
- Yeah, of course. Wow.

11:33.339 --> 11:35.273
Sorry. It says he wants
to arrange a meeting...

11:35.341 --> 11:36.808
for the purpose
of negotiating a treaty.

11:36.876 --> 11:39.811
A Goa'uld wants
to arrange a treaty with us?

11:39.879 --> 11:42.211
Not just one Goa'uld.
All of them.

11:42.281 --> 11:47.048
The system lords.
They wanna send representatives here.

11:54.227 --> 11:56.855
We are preparing
to emerge from hyperspace.

11:56.929 --> 11:59.454
As soon as we drop out,
I'll start broadcasting a signal.

11:59.532 --> 12:02.592
If the Asgard are monitoring the region,
they should find us.

12:15.281 --> 12:18.546
- Should we not be able to see the planet?
- Yes.

12:23.222 --> 12:26.817
We're experiencing the effects of
an extremely powerful gravitational force.

12:26.893 --> 12:30.021
Something's not right. Teal'c, turn us
around and get us out of here now.

12:31.497 --> 12:34.625
Hyperspace generator
will not engage.

12:34.700 --> 12:37.362
Sub-light engines are at maximum,
yet we are not moving.

12:37.437 --> 12:41.703
There's only one thing I know that could
create this kind of gravitational pull.

12:50.416 --> 12:53.146
You're sure this is
an accurate translation of the message?

12:53.219 --> 12:56.711
- Pretty much.
- What do you make of it?

12:58.191 --> 13:00.625
Well, to be honest,
I'm not sure what to think.

13:00.693 --> 13:03.423
The Goa'uld did come here once
to negotiate a treaty.

13:03.496 --> 13:07.296
With the Asgard. Not with us.
Earth just served as neutral territory.

13:07.366 --> 13:10.563
For them to want to meet with us
as equals is extremely unusual.

13:11.337 --> 13:13.396
Maybe we gained a bit
of respect in their eyes.

13:13.473 --> 13:16.465
Yeah. They must've
heard what happened to Anubis.

13:16.542 --> 13:18.567
They couldn't defeat him,
not with all their combined forces.

13:18.644 --> 13:22.307
- And we did it in a single day.
- May explain why they wanna come here.

13:23.049 --> 13:25.916
Yeah. To see how we did it.

13:27.386 --> 13:30.981
It's pretty much what we expected.
We burned out the hyperdrive getting here.

13:33.793 --> 13:36.057
- That is most unfortunate.
- Even if it was working...

13:36.129 --> 13:38.154
it would've been very dangerous
to open a window this close...

13:38.231 --> 13:40.392
to the event horizon
of a black hole.

13:41.467 --> 13:43.594
- Are we that far off course?
- No.

13:43.669 --> 13:46.433
We came out of hyperspace right
where we were supposed to.

13:46.506 --> 13:48.269
This doesn't make any sense.

13:48.341 --> 13:51.936
Hala's sun wasn't nearly massive enough
to collapse into a black hole.

13:52.011 --> 13:54.104
Yet that is what appears
to be happening.

13:56.182 --> 13:58.776
I'll see if I can get a little more
out of the sub-light engines.

14:10.696 --> 14:14.826
The president has authorized me
to pursue negotiations with the Goa'uld.

14:19.272 --> 14:21.763
You don't think I can handle it?

14:21.841 --> 14:25.402
I didn't say that, but if I may,
you don't sound all that confident.

14:26.445 --> 14:29.903
Well, as you said, I have brokered
my share of international negotiations.

14:29.982 --> 14:32.712
This will just
be my first interplanetary one.

14:34.453 --> 14:37.581
The system lords can't be trusted
either as a group or individuals.

14:37.657 --> 14:43.027
They're posturing egomaniacs
driven by an insatiable lust for power...

14:43.095 --> 14:45.495
each one capable
of unimaginable evil.

14:46.799 --> 14:51.429
See? Why should I be nervous? Sounds like
an average day at the United Nations.

14:52.605 --> 14:55.733
Look, I'm not afraid
to admit that I need help.

14:56.776 --> 14:58.801
So what can you tell me?

15:02.682 --> 15:05.981
The high council of the system lords
is a rather flimsy coalition...

15:06.052 --> 15:08.247
of the most powerful Goa'ulds
in the galaxy...

15:08.321 --> 15:10.687
who only cooperate
when it suits them.

15:10.756 --> 15:12.815
Their numbers vary from time to time.
New ones rise up.

15:12.892 --> 15:15.622
Old ones get knocked off.
We think there's about a dozen right now.

15:15.695 --> 15:17.356
I can put together
a summary of what we know.

15:17.430 --> 15:20.831
All right. I assume
I can't just open the iris...

15:20.900 --> 15:23.300
and let the representatives
just walk through?

15:23.369 --> 15:25.667
No. That would
probably be a bad idea.

15:26.739 --> 15:29.401
We should get them to meet us
at a neutral location...

15:29.475 --> 15:33.104
preferably a planet of our choosing,
send a team, check them out...

15:33.179 --> 15:35.943
make sure they're unarmed
and then escort them back.

15:37.149 --> 15:40.118
Good. Send the message.

15:50.663 --> 15:52.756
We are now being pulled backwards.

15:52.832 --> 15:54.959
Perhaps if we divert power
from the shield-

15:55.034 --> 15:57.969
Right now they're the only thing
holding the ship together.

15:58.037 --> 16:00.835
Drop them, and the gravitational field
could tear us apart.

16:00.906 --> 16:02.498
I do not believe
there is any other choice.

16:08.347 --> 16:09.939
Diverting power.

16:15.021 --> 16:17.251
We are now moving forward.

16:17.323 --> 16:19.951
It's not gonna be good enough.
We're losing hull integrity.

16:25.731 --> 16:27.460
We've got a hull breach!

16:33.205 --> 16:34.672
Greetings.

16:36.542 --> 16:38.100
Thor.

16:38.177 --> 16:41.704
It is good to see you again,
Major Carter, Teal'c.

16:43.449 --> 16:46.145
- Likewise.
- Indeed.

16:48.087 --> 16:50.248
Your timing is impeccable.

16:53.659 --> 16:56.594
So the Goa'uld have agreed to our terms
for their travel here.

16:57.596 --> 16:59.086
Yeah.

17:01.233 --> 17:02.495
I was just going over
some research material...

17:02.568 --> 17:04.160
on the delegates they're sending.

17:04.236 --> 17:06.466
Camulus is the one
who sent the original message.

17:06.539 --> 17:10.134
Then there's Amaterasu,
Japanese sun goddess...

17:10.209 --> 17:12.677
and the last one is Lord Yu.

17:13.779 --> 17:15.337
- "Yu"?
- Don't.

17:15.414 --> 17:18.406
Every joke, every pun done to death.
Seriously.

17:18.484 --> 17:21.783
I just thought I remembered reading
he was not himself or something.

17:21.854 --> 17:25.950
Of course, for a Goa'uld,
what that means exactly, I'm not sure.

17:26.992 --> 17:28.550
Please. Continue.

17:28.627 --> 17:30.424
Well, he no longer has the ability
to take on a new host...

17:30.496 --> 17:32.361
and it seems
the regenerative powers...

17:32.431 --> 17:34.331
of the sarcophagus
are losing its effectiveness.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.891
- Basically, he's suffering from old age.
- He's senile.

17:36.969 --> 17:38.903
Why would they choose him
as a representative?

17:38.971 --> 17:42.998
- His underlings may be covering for him.
- The other system lords don't know.

17:43.075 --> 17:45.168
The interesting thing is Lord Yu
was the one system lord...

17:45.244 --> 17:47.769
who opposed Anubis's desire
to be reinstated to the council...

17:47.847 --> 17:49.747
after his banishment.

17:49.815 --> 17:52.079
Long story.
The point is that he fell out of favor...

17:52.151 --> 17:53.880
when the other system lords
accepted Anubis back...

17:53.953 --> 17:56.387
and he used his power
to become a de facto leader.

17:56.455 --> 18:00.789
So now that Anubis is gone, you think
the balance of power shifted back to Yu.

18:01.627 --> 18:03.185
On the bright side,
out of all the Goa'uld...

18:03.262 --> 18:05.287
Lord Yu has been
the most cooperative with us.

18:05.364 --> 18:09.198
- I thought you said none could be trusted.
- They can't, especially not a crazy one.

18:09.268 --> 18:11.293
That's the bright side?

18:12.738 --> 18:14.968
More of a slightly less dark side.

18:16.709 --> 18:21.305
I am afraid I cannot leave this sector,
Major, not at the moment.

18:21.380 --> 18:24.781
Thor, you're the only one
who can save Colonel O'Neill.

18:24.850 --> 18:27.944
As you have said, he is being preserved
in stasis at the moment.

18:28.020 --> 18:32.582
I'll be glad to return with you to Earth
as soon as my mission here is completed.

18:32.658 --> 18:34.922
- What is your mission?
- I must wait here...

18:34.994 --> 18:38.054
until I am certain
the Replicators have been destroyed.

18:38.831 --> 18:42.392
You may have noticed that Hala's sun
has collapsed into a black hole.

18:42.468 --> 18:44.493
Just before the back
of our ship was torn off.

18:44.570 --> 18:48.506
I'm sorry I did not reach you sooner.
I was not expecting you.

18:48.574 --> 18:51.805
Yeah. You haven't been responding
to our attempts to contact you.

18:51.877 --> 18:55.870
I am sorry. Time-space distortions
caused by the black hole...

18:55.948 --> 18:59.748
have been interfering with
my ship's long-range communications.

18:59.819 --> 19:03.118
- Understandable.
- Indeed... for some.

19:03.189 --> 19:06.022
The time-dilation field
was only a temporary measure.

19:06.091 --> 19:08.889
We knew the time it would take
for the Replicator humans...

19:08.961 --> 19:13.398
to reach the machine would translate
to less than two years outside the field.

19:13.466 --> 19:16.162
Therefore, a more permanent solution
was devised.

19:17.036 --> 19:19.368
So you collapsed the sun.

19:19.438 --> 19:23.204
By artificially increasing
its gravitational field, yes.

19:23.976 --> 19:26.604
That's... pretty cool.

19:27.646 --> 19:31.241
As you can see,
the planet has already broken apart.

19:32.718 --> 19:36.313
However, a large number of Replicators
have managed to come together...

19:36.388 --> 19:39.789
in a coherent mass
that has yet to pass the event horizon.

19:39.859 --> 19:42.054
Well, even if they can
withstand the gravitational force...

19:42.127 --> 19:44.391
without being torn apart,
there's no way they could ever-

19:44.463 --> 19:47.261
- Interesting.
- What is it?

19:48.334 --> 19:52.031
The mass of Replicator blocks have begun
moving away from the event horizon.

19:52.104 --> 19:54.072
How is that possible?

19:54.139 --> 19:56.539
They have the time-dilation device.

19:56.609 --> 20:00.511
I do not know exactly how, but they seem
to have used it to counteract...

20:00.579 --> 20:03.377
the gravitational effects
that should be pulling them in.

20:03.449 --> 20:08.512
Frightening. Not only that they
can do that, but that you don't know how.

20:08.587 --> 20:11.055
I agree.

20:13.092 --> 20:17.756
They are picking up speed. Scans indicate
the blocks have formed together.

20:18.998 --> 20:21.364
- Into what?
- A ship.

20:21.433 --> 20:23.424
They are escaping.

20:24.436 --> 20:27.667
Their course indicates
they are headed this way.

20:33.846 --> 20:37.145
- I thought you were gonna stand me up.
- Yeah. Sorry.

20:38.450 --> 20:41.248
- Heard anything from Teal'c and Sam?
- No.

20:44.356 --> 20:46.688
<i>Receiving a signal, ma'am.</i>

20:46.759 --> 20:49.284
<i>SG-7 reports we have a green light.</i>

20:52.565 --> 20:54.760
Open the iris.

21:12.451 --> 21:14.885
Welcome to Earth.
Allow me to introduce-

21:14.954 --> 21:20.722
- We are not interested in your name.
- Really? I find it helps-

21:20.793 --> 21:23.785
We prefer to present our offer
so we can spend as brief a time...

21:23.862 --> 21:26.729
as possible on this planet.

21:30.436 --> 21:32.495
Right this way.

21:49.321 --> 21:51.346
- Have you ever seen anything like it?
- No...

21:51.423 --> 21:54.688
and it is doubtful my ship's weapons
will be effective against it.

21:55.728 --> 21:58.822
We should probably
get out of here then, huh?

21:58.897 --> 22:00.831
Can you jump into hyperspace?

22:00.899 --> 22:05.427
We must clear the gravitational
distortion field of the black hole first.

22:08.507 --> 22:12.603
- They have fired upon us.
- Can it penetrate your shields?

22:12.678 --> 22:14.612
It is more than likely.

22:18.350 --> 22:20.181
Brace for impact.

22:26.792 --> 22:29.283
- The hull has been breached.
- Where?

22:31.363 --> 22:33.331
The damage is minimal.

22:33.399 --> 22:36.129
The projectile was likely composed
of Replicators.

22:36.201 --> 22:38.328
They are not visible
to my ship's scanners.

22:38.404 --> 22:41.999
This is how they have
boarded Asgard ships in the past.

22:42.074 --> 22:44.668
Can you use the shields to prevent
decompression in those sections?

22:44.743 --> 22:46.540
Yes.

23:00.325 --> 23:02.623
Your unexpected defeat of Anubis...

23:02.695 --> 23:06.153
has created an unstable situation
among the system lords.

23:06.231 --> 23:09.496
In order to avoid open war,
we came to an agreement...

23:09.568 --> 23:12.093
to divide his territories
and his armies evenly.

23:12.171 --> 23:16.267
- How civilized of you.
- Yes.

23:16.341 --> 23:18.866
Unfortunately, one among us
has broken that agreement.

23:18.944 --> 23:21.674
Oh, no, no. Don't tell me.
Let me guess. It's-

23:22.681 --> 23:24.171
- Ba'al.
- Ba'al.

23:24.249 --> 23:26.979
He was able to learn
the location of the planet...

23:27.052 --> 23:28.883
where Anubis
was creating his Kull warriors.

23:28.954 --> 23:32.446
Ba'al got there before you and found a way
to program the soldiers to serve him.

23:32.524 --> 23:34.856
With those Orac at his command...

23:34.927 --> 23:37.657
Ba'al has tipped the balance
of power in his favor.

23:37.730 --> 23:39.630
- Orac?
- Unspeakable.

23:39.698 --> 23:44.533
In battle, the Kull are far superior
to theJaffa.

23:44.603 --> 23:47.071
Already, many among us
have begun to speak...

23:47.139 --> 23:50.131
of capitulation,
much as they did with Anubis.

23:51.944 --> 23:55.641
If that happens,
Ba'al will indeed be unstoppable.

23:55.714 --> 23:59.878
This is all very interesting, but I fail
to see what it has to do with us.

24:13.165 --> 24:17.864
My master wishes to say it is well known
the Tauri possess a powerful new weapon...

24:17.936 --> 24:20.461
something far beyond
their current level of technology.

24:20.539 --> 24:24.373
Yes. We used it to kill Anubis
and destroy his fleet.

24:24.443 --> 24:28.641
By means of this weapon, Ba'al can be
prevented from conquering the galaxy.

25:26.038 --> 25:27.699
Major Carter!

25:30.709 --> 25:34.543
Thor, it is Teal'c. Major Carter was
beamed away. Is she in your presence?

25:34.613 --> 25:38.879
I did not do it.
The Replicators must have her.

25:56.235 --> 25:59.363
I have eliminated
all of the Replicators I could locate.

25:59.438 --> 26:01.406
There is no way of knowing
if there are more.

26:02.574 --> 26:05.441
The Replicator ship
has entered hyperspace.

26:05.510 --> 26:07.910
- Can you follow?
- Yes.

26:14.753 --> 26:18.382
If Ba'al defeats us,
how long do you think it'll be...

26:18.457 --> 26:21.119
before he turns his attention to you?

26:21.193 --> 26:23.923
If he does,
he'll suffer the same fate as Anubis.

26:23.996 --> 26:28.126
Perhaps. But there are other worlds
in this galaxy...

26:28.200 --> 26:30.634
without the luxury
of such advanced defenses.

26:30.702 --> 26:32.829
What are you talking about?

26:33.972 --> 26:37.772
I could not help but notice that
the Asgard did not come to your aid...

26:37.843 --> 26:40.744
when Anubis threatened your planet.

26:40.812 --> 26:45.010
In fact, we've heard nothing from
the Asgard for quite some time now.

26:45.083 --> 26:48.314
Really? That's odd,
'cause we talk to them all the time.

26:48.387 --> 26:51.948
The Asgard didn't come
because they knew it wasn't necessary.

26:52.024 --> 26:54.424
Ba'al believes otherwise.

26:54.493 --> 26:58.156
He is convinced that the Asgard can
no longer exercise power in this galaxy.

26:59.131 --> 27:01.031
He intends
to take the planets protected...

27:01.099 --> 27:04.125
under the Goa'uld/ Asgard Treaty
for himself.

27:04.202 --> 27:08.400
If you do not help us stop him,
millions of humans will die.

27:10.142 --> 27:12.542
And millions more will be enslaved.

27:18.884 --> 27:22.217
- Do you know its destination?
- Before you destroyed them...

27:22.287 --> 27:25.779
the Replicators managed
to access the ship's computer.

27:25.857 --> 27:28.951
They learned the location of Orilla,
the planet where we are attempting...

27:29.027 --> 27:31.655
to rebuild the Asgard civilization.

27:31.730 --> 27:34.699
I assumed
it would be their first target.

27:34.766 --> 27:38.202
- What is your reasoning?
- Orilla is rich in neutronium...

27:38.270 --> 27:40.363
which is a key element
in Asgard technology...

27:41.473 --> 27:45.034
and is also essential for the creation
of human-form Replicators.

28:13.372 --> 28:17.206
- Major Carter.
- Fifth.

28:17.275 --> 28:19.334
I imagine you never expected
to see me again.

28:19.411 --> 28:23.313
Look, I'm sorry we left you behind,
but we had to do it.

28:23.382 --> 28:27.079
We couldn't risk the others getting out.
You know what they're capable of.

28:29.388 --> 28:32.687
- I know you must be upset.
- Upset?

28:32.758 --> 28:34.521
We betrayed you.
It must have hurt.

28:35.527 --> 28:40.430
See, that's the part of you that's most like us-
the human part of you.

28:42.434 --> 28:45.562
- I understand how you feel.
- No, you don't!

28:47.272 --> 28:51.766
You couldn't.
But I promise you will.

29:15.100 --> 29:18.831
How many planets
are protected under this treaty?

29:18.904 --> 29:22.271
Twenty-six.
Twenty-seven if you include Earth.

29:22.340 --> 29:26.436
And what good is it if the Asgard aren't
actually available to protect anything?

29:26.511 --> 29:30.607
At one time they were. More recently, we've
been trading on the threat, kind of a bluff.

29:30.682 --> 29:35.779
- Well, Ba'al is about to call the bluff.
- There's nothing we can do about that.

29:35.854 --> 29:38.618
Earth is safe so long as the Goa'uld
think we can defend ourselves.

29:38.690 --> 29:41.557
- But that's a bluff too.
- Yeah. More or less.

29:43.462 --> 29:46.260
When I was a kid, my dad used
to have these weekly poker games.

29:46.331 --> 29:49.164
All I remember is smoke
made my eyes water.

29:49.234 --> 29:50.826
I'm starting to wish
I'd paid more attention.

29:50.902 --> 29:53.427
I'm sure you've misrepresented
the truth before in negotiations.

29:53.505 --> 29:57.339
Actually, no. My job has usually been
to get people to recognize the truth.

29:57.409 --> 30:00.207
Well, if they even get a hint of the fact
that we can't use the Ancient weapons...

30:00.278 --> 30:04.009
to defend ourselves,
trust me, this game is over.

30:05.684 --> 30:09.984
- Too dramatic?
- At this point, not for me.

30:17.662 --> 30:20.256
- How can we stop them?
- My ship's weapons will not function...

30:20.332 --> 30:23.665
in hyperspace, much like the shields.

30:23.735 --> 30:26.761
However, in close proximity,
the self-destruct...

30:26.838 --> 30:29.739
may be sufficient
to eliminate both ships.

30:29.808 --> 30:32.436
I am sorry,
but we have no choice.

30:32.511 --> 30:35.036
If the human-form Replicators
reach Orilla...

30:35.113 --> 30:38.139
they will have the resources
to replicate many thousands of times.

30:39.484 --> 30:44.649
- We cannot allow that to happen.
- So be it.

30:57.869 --> 31:00.838
- Why are you doing this?
- You think you deserve better?

31:02.707 --> 31:05.198
You can see my thoughts.
You know I didn't wanna do it.

31:07.846 --> 31:10.041
I suppose, in a way,
I should thank you.

31:11.116 --> 31:14.381
It was because of what you did to me
I came to realize my full potential.

31:15.987 --> 31:18.785
I am more human than the others.

31:18.857 --> 31:21.451
At first, I thought it was a weakness...

31:21.526 --> 31:25.860
but now I see... it makes me capable
of so much more.

31:25.931 --> 31:27.990
Fifth, please.

31:28.066 --> 31:31.001
My brothers and sisters
will devour entire civilizations...

31:31.069 --> 31:36.234
in order to replicate, but they will
know nothing of cruelty...

31:37.309 --> 31:41.040
or betrayal or revenge.

31:43.381 --> 31:48.250
Not like us. Isn't that right...

31:50.589 --> 31:52.784
Major Carter?

32:03.935 --> 32:06.165
<i>We appreciate</i>
<i>you bringing us this information...</i>

32:06.238 --> 32:08.729
but it doesn't change the fact
that we can't get involved...

32:08.807 --> 32:11.139
in any internal Goa'uld dispute.

32:11.209 --> 32:14.007
And if Ba'al tries to attack any
of the protected planets...

32:14.079 --> 32:16.070
he'll suffer the consequences.

32:16.147 --> 32:18.707
Unfortunately, we do not
share your faith in the Asgard.

32:18.783 --> 32:21.718
We must stop Ba'al
before it comes to that.

32:21.786 --> 32:25.187
You'll forgive my bluntness,
but that's not our problem.

32:25.257 --> 32:26.246
Enough!

32:29.628 --> 32:32.825
With each passing moment,
Anubis grows more powerful.

32:36.234 --> 32:38.361
You mean Ba'al.

32:40.038 --> 32:42.836
My master is fatigued.
We request a short adjournment-

32:42.907 --> 32:43.999
Silence!

32:46.611 --> 32:49.409
I need no adjournment.

32:52.417 --> 32:55.181
We know you have a formidable
new defensive weapon...

32:55.253 --> 32:58.484
but with it, you must wait
for your enemies to come to you.

32:59.324 --> 33:02.191
And that can be dangerous.

33:02.260 --> 33:05.661
What if an enemy were to devise a means
of defeating this weapon?

33:07.065 --> 33:08.828
What exactly are you offering?

33:08.900 --> 33:11.027
Hyperdrive engines.

33:11.102 --> 33:15.163
We know you have battleships that
are not capable of interstellar travel.

33:15.240 --> 33:18.937
We are offering you a means
of producing a fleet of ships...

33:19.010 --> 33:21.478
as advanced
as the Goa'uld Ha'tak vessels.

33:26.685 --> 33:29.518
You could take the fight
to the enemy.

33:37.228 --> 33:39.219
We are almost within range.

33:52.610 --> 33:53.634
Now.

33:59.117 --> 34:01.210
We are slowing down.

34:04.823 --> 34:07.155
Something is interfering
with the controls-

34:08.927 --> 34:12.363
the auxiliary control console
outside the engine room.

34:19.804 --> 34:23.535
Your offer is very generous, but
I'm afraid we're gonna have to decline.

34:25.410 --> 34:27.503
You would be able to uphold
the protected planets' treaty...

34:27.579 --> 34:30.548
with or without the aid
of the Asgard.

34:30.615 --> 34:32.606
How many hyperdrives
are you willing to give us?

34:32.684 --> 34:35.619
How many ships can you build?

34:35.687 --> 34:39.123
I think the real question is
how many ships do you have?

34:40.125 --> 34:42.923
I mean, if we're gonna enforce
this treaty ourselves, we need to...

34:42.994 --> 34:46.020
build enough ships to match any fleet
that would oppose us.

34:46.097 --> 34:48.224
We are not at liberty
to disclose such information.

34:48.299 --> 34:50.631
Well, then, this discussion is over.

34:51.636 --> 34:53.831
How can you blithely
reject such an offer?

34:53.905 --> 34:56.135
Because we're not about
to fight your battles for you...

34:56.207 --> 34:58.004
in exchange for a couple
of hyperdrive engines...

34:58.076 --> 35:00.067
that may or may not do us any good.

35:00.979 --> 35:04.039
And especially since we already
have that technology at our disposal.

35:05.517 --> 35:08.543
- You have viable hyperdrive technology?
- Yes, we do.

35:08.620 --> 35:13.148
And with the help of the Asgard, we're in
the process of implementing it right now.

35:13.224 --> 35:15.556
So thank you very much.

35:15.627 --> 35:19.996
This Ancient weapon:
Such an advanced piece of technology.

35:20.064 --> 35:22.624
The power requirements
must be enormous.

35:23.435 --> 35:26.700
Even simple maintenance
must be extremely difficult...

35:26.771 --> 35:28.636
given your limited capabilities.

35:29.574 --> 35:33.408
- We manage.
- Of course. We believe you.

35:34.446 --> 35:38.280
But I wonder what Ba'al would think
if he were to receive intelligence...

35:38.349 --> 35:42.809
that the weapon was...
temporarily out of commission.

35:44.155 --> 35:46.988
He would come to this world
to claim it for himself.

35:47.058 --> 35:48.685
The Tauri would be forced
to destroy him.

35:48.760 --> 35:52.457
And we would have
to give them... nothing.

35:52.530 --> 35:55.363
Oh, come on.
Ba'al would never fall for that.

35:55.433 --> 35:58.994
He knows how desperate you are. I think
he might find this information convenient.

35:59.070 --> 36:01.300
Perhaps.
But you leave us few options.

36:03.074 --> 36:05.702
Okay. We'll do it.

36:07.479 --> 36:11.848
- We will?
- In exchange, we want Ba'al's territory.

36:13.785 --> 36:15.878
- What do you mean?
- That's the way it works, right?

36:15.954 --> 36:17.819
When one system lord
kills another...

36:17.889 --> 36:21.484
he takes over his armies,
his fleet, his planets.

36:21.559 --> 36:24.494
That's what we want-
everything in Ba'al's possession.

36:25.730 --> 36:27.891
You cannot be serious.

36:27.966 --> 36:30.526
If we're gonna be the ones
who destroy Ba'al for you...

36:30.602 --> 36:32.229
why should we settle
for anything less?

36:32.303 --> 36:35.238
- Preposterous.
- We can't accept those terms.

36:35.306 --> 36:37.297
Take it or leave it.

36:42.213 --> 36:45.774
We must send a message
to the other system lords...

36:45.850 --> 36:47.647
to advise them
of the current situation.

36:48.786 --> 36:50.378
Go ahead.

37:00.465 --> 37:02.365
The problem has been eliminated.

37:02.433 --> 37:05.402
<i>Unfortunately, the Replicators</i>
<i>are now beyond our reach.</i>

37:05.470 --> 37:09.099
We are too late to stop them from
reaching the new Asgard home world.

37:17.115 --> 37:20.983
I guess you did learn something
from your father's poker games.

37:21.052 --> 37:23.043
Always bet big when bluffing?

37:23.121 --> 37:25.715
I just didn't know you were looking
to become a system lord.

37:25.790 --> 37:28.384
I just had to do something
to keep them talking.

37:28.459 --> 37:31.758
It looked like they were gonna try to
draw Ba'al here no matter what we said.

37:31.829 --> 37:34.127
We can be pretty sure they're
not gonna agree to our terms.

37:34.198 --> 37:35.995
I know.

37:39.037 --> 37:40.937
We may have
to revive Colonel O'Neill.

37:45.944 --> 37:47.070
What?

37:47.145 --> 37:49.010
If they suspect we're bluffing...

37:49.080 --> 37:50.843
they'll come here
and take the weapon for themselves.

37:50.915 --> 37:52.883
If they don't,
they'll trick Ba'al into coming.

37:52.951 --> 37:56.717
Either way, we may have to use
that weapon again to defend this planet.

37:57.889 --> 38:00.790
We don't even know if there's
enough power to fire another shot.

38:00.858 --> 38:02.018
I know.

38:02.093 --> 38:05.085
If you try to reviveJack without
the Asgard standing by, it'll kill him.

38:05.163 --> 38:08.030
In fact, he'll probably die
before he can do anything to help us.

38:09.534 --> 38:12.765
Dr. Weir. It's a copy of the message
the Goa'ulds sent to the system lords.

38:12.837 --> 38:14.828
It's coded.

38:16.608 --> 38:19.406
We need to know what they're thinking.

38:30.188 --> 38:32.850
I have managed
to send advance warning to Orilla.

38:32.924 --> 38:36.951
By providing them with
the Replicator ship's course and speed...

38:37.028 --> 38:40.429
they should have a fair approximation
of where it will drop out of hyperspace.

38:40.498 --> 38:44.025
What ships we have available
will be waiting in ambush.

38:44.102 --> 38:46.400
You believe the Asgard ships
can destroy the Replicators...

38:46.471 --> 38:47.995
before they can raise their shields.

38:48.072 --> 38:51.041
They will only be defenseless
for a few moments...

38:51.109 --> 38:54.442
but if my calculations are accurate,
that should be sufficient.

39:01.452 --> 39:04.046
Stop it! Please.

39:04.122 --> 39:06.147
Why should I?

39:08.393 --> 39:10.520
You can't change what happened.

39:10.595 --> 39:12.688
Is this making you feel better?

39:14.432 --> 39:18.198
- I never intended to abandon you.
- But you did.

39:19.003 --> 39:21.870
You gained my trust,
then you used me and left me behind.

39:21.939 --> 39:25.500
- It wasn't my decision.
- You could've come back for me.

39:25.576 --> 39:27.874
- There was no time.
- Time?

39:29.080 --> 39:33.517
Thanks to what you did, I had plenty
of time to think about what a fool I was.

39:34.385 --> 39:38.913
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
for what we did to you.

39:41.726 --> 39:43.216
Yes.

39:44.862 --> 39:46.659
You are now.

39:48.566 --> 39:51.000
Part of being human
is having compassion...

39:52.203 --> 39:54.103
learning to forgive.

39:55.873 --> 39:58.569
Yes. I'm not there yet.

40:00.078 --> 40:01.705
I need more time.

40:21.966 --> 40:24.230
- Progress?
- Yeah.

40:24.302 --> 40:26.167
It's basically a confirmation
of what we suspected.

40:26.237 --> 40:27.898
They think we're bluffing
but have no way...

40:27.972 --> 40:30.839
of confirming their suspicions,
so they're not sure what to do.

40:30.908 --> 40:33.968
They could still try and draw Ba'al here,
let him figure it out for them.

40:34.045 --> 40:35.444
Yeah. That's dangerous for them.

40:35.513 --> 40:37.913
- Because if we can't power the weapons-
- Which we can't.

40:37.982 --> 40:41.474
Ba'al would end up with both Earth
and the Ancient outpost.

40:41.552 --> 40:43.747
<i>Unscheduled off-world activation.</i>

40:49.393 --> 40:51.623
This is Weir.
What's happening?

40:53.965 --> 40:55.956
Okay. We'll be right down.

40:56.968 --> 40:58.993
Our guests just got a response.

41:06.944 --> 41:10.675
<i>Commander Thor,</i>
<i>this is Aegir of the</i> Valhalla.

41:10.748 --> 41:14.184
<i>We have assumed defensive positions</i>
<i>and are awaiting the target ship.</i>

41:14.252 --> 41:15.742
Understood.

41:30.001 --> 41:32.492
<i>The enemy's ship</i>
<i>has been destroyed.</i>

41:35.039 --> 41:37.098
I am sorry, Teal'c.

41:46.184 --> 41:49.153
I need to see the most recent message
they received.

41:57.862 --> 41:59.955
It's unfortunate
you're being recalled.

42:00.031 --> 42:02.397
I thought
we were making such good progress.

42:02.466 --> 42:06.903
Your demands were ridiculous. We had
no choice but to terminate negotiations.

42:07.839 --> 42:10.069
Well, give my regards to Ba'al.

42:25.389 --> 42:27.949
- Shut it down.
- What?

42:36.868 --> 42:39.234
- What is the meaning of this?
- The second message.

42:39.303 --> 42:41.999
They've been recalled because the system lords
have decided to test our defenses.

42:42.073 --> 42:45.509
They're sending a ship to attack Earth.
It'll be here within the hour.
