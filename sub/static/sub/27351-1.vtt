01:00.027 --> 01:01.960
- Elle.
- Elle.

01:03.163 --> 01:04.596
I had an idea for
Misfit Christmas.

01:04.631 --> 01:05.975
Now, are we sure
that this isn't the year

01:05.999 --> 01:07.566
where we stop calling it that?

01:07.601 --> 01:08.967
I mean, it's a Christmas party.

01:09.002 --> 01:09.868
We are grownups.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.603
Is "Misfit" really the best
we can do?

01:11.638 --> 01:13.583
We could go back to calling it
"The Christmas Party

01:13.607 --> 01:15.507
at the Island
of Misfit Toys..."

01:15.542 --> 01:17.743
But it's a mouthful,
so we shortened it.

01:17.778 --> 01:19.811
Listen to Elle, she has
the best memory.

01:19.847 --> 01:22.114
Plus, "Misfit" is better
than when we were calling it...

01:22.149 --> 01:24.950
"Lonely in the Dorms Christmas".

01:24.985 --> 01:26.952
Also listen to Alexis,
she reminds us

01:26.987 --> 01:29.154
that we've always been terrible
at naming things.

01:29.189 --> 01:30.489
Yeah.

01:32.593 --> 01:33.525
No.

01:33.560 --> 01:34.793
He hasn't been in yet.

01:34.828 --> 01:36.495
Who?

01:36.530 --> 01:38.263
Nothing.

01:38.298 --> 01:39.898
Jay, how'd your date go?

01:39.933 --> 01:41.299
My date did not go as planned.

01:41.335 --> 01:43.012
Let's just, let's just
leave it at that.

01:43.036 --> 01:45.036
Did you do that thing where
you mask nervousness

01:45.072 --> 01:47.172
by over-explaining things?

01:47.207 --> 01:48.039
Yes.

01:48.075 --> 01:49.975
You have to relax.

01:50.010 --> 01:52.978
You are a totally normal person
in real life.

01:53.013 --> 01:55.147
Thank you, thank you, I think.

01:55.182 --> 01:56.014
Elle, let's get back to what
you were talking about.

01:56.049 --> 01:58.049
Your big idea for
Misfit Christmas?

01:58.085 --> 01:59.818
Do we need a bigger space?

01:59.853 --> 02:02.053
I mean, with all of the party
games and the food

02:02.089 --> 02:03.188
and the carols...

02:03.223 --> 02:04.156
No, look. I appreciate it, Elle,
but we're doing it here.

02:04.191 --> 02:06.491
I mean, I'll just close down
for the night.

02:06.527 --> 02:09.026
- You'll lose business.
- It's totally worth it.

02:09.062 --> 02:11.496
15 of our nearest and dearest
and their spouses

02:11.532 --> 02:14.866
and their kids and all of them
packed in here.

02:14.902 --> 02:16.201
I sort of can't wait.

02:16.236 --> 02:19.971
- Okay, as long as you're sure.
- I'm totally sure.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.476
It's coffee guy.

02:24.511 --> 02:26.878
- That's coffee guy?
- It is.

02:26.914 --> 02:29.481
- Don't look.
- We're already looking.

02:29.516 --> 02:32.617
- Coffee guy has seen us looking.
- Well, stop looking.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.886
How long has this been going on?

02:34.922 --> 02:36.354
A few days.

02:37.458 --> 02:39.002
I think he's new to the city,
but I can't tell.

02:39.026 --> 02:41.271
Do you want us to flag him down,
because I can definitely...

02:41.295 --> 02:42.661
No, no, Jay.

02:43.597 --> 02:48.700
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:50.370 --> 02:53.839
Thanks again.
See ya.

02:59.713 --> 03:03.415
- Well, that went poorly.
- It really did.

03:05.319 --> 03:06.618
What?

03:06.653 --> 03:08.386
Nothing, nothing.

03:08.422 --> 03:10.088
Should we go?

03:10.791 --> 03:11.523
Yeah.

03:11.558 --> 03:12.858
What, you guys just got here.

03:12.893 --> 03:13.758
It's Sunday.

03:13.794 --> 03:16.761
And, it is two weeks
before Christmas.

03:16.797 --> 03:19.297
I spent all of November making
sure my boss thinks I'm great,

03:19.333 --> 03:20.465
and getting ahead at work.

03:20.501 --> 03:21.399
Which means, in turn,

03:21.435 --> 03:24.636
I am now behind on shopping
and errands

03:24.671 --> 03:26.204
and getting the party
setup done,

03:26.240 --> 03:27.439
and I've got six days to...

03:27.474 --> 03:30.208
Look, every year, you throw us
this Misfit Christmas Party.

03:30.244 --> 03:32.911
And every year, it's amazing.

03:32.946 --> 03:34.424
How is this year gonna
be any different?

03:34.448 --> 03:37.315
Because I like to outdo myself,
Ryan.

03:37.351 --> 03:38.950
Let's go, Jay.

03:39.520 --> 03:40.520
Bye.

03:46.326 --> 03:47.526
What about this?

03:50.163 --> 03:53.198
I don't think that Alexis
wears perfume, does she?

03:54.201 --> 03:56.167
She's hard to shop for.

03:56.203 --> 03:58.904
Not if you listen.

03:58.939 --> 04:01.306
Always complaining her feet
are cold.

04:01.341 --> 04:02.140
Right.

04:02.175 --> 04:02.874
Yeah.

04:02.910 --> 04:03.910
Yup. Thank you.

04:06.580 --> 04:07.580
Hi.

04:07.748 --> 04:08.413
Hi.

04:08.448 --> 04:10.482
Can I help you find something?

04:10.517 --> 04:12.984
I like the perfume.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.055
It's... Fiona.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.356
Your boss, Fiona?

04:18.392 --> 04:19.491
Yeah.

04:19.526 --> 04:21.259
Excuse me.

04:23.931 --> 04:24.763
Our boss, actually.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.631
We work in the same place.

04:26.667 --> 04:27.832
Hey, Fiona.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.000
Is everything okay?

04:30.170 --> 04:33.038
Not in the least, but nothing
for you to worry about.

04:33.073 --> 04:34.150
It's the Century Cookware
account.

04:34.174 --> 04:36.052
In my haste this morning,
I accidentally added you

04:36.076 --> 04:38.510
to an email thread about it,
and I just wanted to warn you

04:38.545 --> 04:39.778
to ignore it.

04:39.813 --> 04:42.747
<i>Also, do you know how to turn
the lights on, on the weekend?</i>

04:42.783 --> 04:46.651
The switch is by the break room.

04:46.687 --> 04:47.886
What's going on?

04:47.921 --> 04:49.921
What's going on is I'm here
on a Sunday,

04:49.957 --> 04:51.923
my assistant isn't answering,
and...

04:51.959 --> 04:54.025
Do you need my help?

04:54.061 --> 04:56.328
My account is pretty much on
autopilot for the holidays,

04:56.363 --> 04:57.495
I could drop by.

04:57.531 --> 04:58.430
No.

04:58.465 --> 04:59.776
Why should everyone's weekend
be ruined?

04:59.800 --> 05:03.201
You know me,
I am always willing to...

05:03.236 --> 05:04.703
Light. Got it.

05:04.738 --> 05:07.672
You enjoy your break.

05:07.708 --> 05:09.474
Ignore the emails.

05:13.246 --> 05:15.680
It's like I literally
lose my mind.

05:15.716 --> 05:17.415
Do women like nervous guys?

05:17.451 --> 05:20.719
Should I just rebrand
to "dashing but anxious?"

05:20.754 --> 05:23.521
Elle, are you listening?

05:23.557 --> 05:25.991
Sorry, I'm sorry.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.760
I think you're charming, Jay.

05:28.795 --> 05:30.795
Someone else out there will,
too.

05:30.831 --> 05:35.200
And, it has always been my
theory that when you meet her,

05:35.235 --> 05:39.270
you will be completely normal
in front of her.

05:39.306 --> 05:41.306
Well, I appreciate that,
thank you.

05:41.341 --> 05:42.852
But I am not taking your word
for anything

05:42.876 --> 05:46.111
until you get back out
there yourself.

05:46.146 --> 05:48.079
I am out there.

05:48.115 --> 05:49.214
Yeah.

05:49.249 --> 05:52.550
You saw me, I absolutely flirted
with that coffee guy.

05:55.122 --> 05:56.921
Okay, another RSVP.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.758
That means everyone who still
lives in Chicago is a yes

05:59.793 --> 06:02.494
for Misfit Christmas,
the four of us plus Anne,

06:02.529 --> 06:05.296
Richard, Linda, Marsha,
Dawn and Dan.

06:05.332 --> 06:06.264
And the others?

06:06.299 --> 06:09.367
There's a thread
that everyone's on.

06:09.403 --> 06:11.236
I'm heading uptown,
are you coming?

06:11.271 --> 06:13.605
I'm gonna go to work and check
on Fiona, actually.

06:13.640 --> 06:17.575
You want her to put you in for
that creative director position.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.544
Okay, all right.

06:19.579 --> 06:22.947
I have spent all year trying
to get Fiona to notice me.

06:22.983 --> 06:24.082
All right.

06:24.117 --> 06:26.029
And listen, if you need any help
with Misfit Christmas,

06:26.053 --> 06:27.152
let me know, okay?

06:27.187 --> 06:28.853
I will.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.689
Promise.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.824
- No, you won't.
- I probably won't.

06:32.859 --> 06:33.870
All right, see you tomorrow.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.827
Okay, Bye.

06:54.648 --> 06:55.613
I'm so sorry.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.382
No, I was working while walking.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.828
It's a terrible habit, I just...

06:58.852 --> 06:59.852
Me too.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.288
Coffee shop.

07:03.323 --> 07:04.489
The Brewing Pot.

07:04.524 --> 07:04.989
Yes.

07:05.025 --> 07:05.790
Right.

07:05.826 --> 07:09.828
I love that place.
My friend Alexis owns it.

07:09.863 --> 07:11.262
Everyone's so friendly in there.

07:11.298 --> 07:13.565
Yeah.
The coffee's great.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.066
It is great, yeah.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.974
I should...

07:23.009 --> 07:24.209
Yeah, me too.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.646
Merry Christmas.

07:28.682 --> 07:31.149
Merry Christmas.
I'll see you at the...

07:31.184 --> 07:32.617
Yes.

07:32.652 --> 07:35.320
Yeah.
Okay.

07:37.324 --> 07:39.157
What's his name?

07:45.298 --> 07:46.298
Her name?

07:52.038 --> 07:53.304
What happened?

07:53.340 --> 07:55.306
Century Cookware account.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.878
<i>This is supposed to launch
in two days.</i>

08:01.615 --> 08:04.382
And this is the commercial

08:04.417 --> 08:07.986
launched by their top
competitor, today.

08:09.756 --> 08:11.489
That is not good.

08:11.525 --> 08:12.824
Except, it is a good ad.

08:12.859 --> 08:14.592
Now ours looks like
we copied it.

08:14.628 --> 08:17.028
And yet, neither of the ads
have people in them.

08:17.063 --> 08:20.098
We'll figure it out.
They called Maxwell Turner in.

08:20.133 --> 08:22.567
That guy who works
in the New York office?

08:22.602 --> 08:25.103
Yes.
He's fixed a lot of campaigns.

08:25.138 --> 08:27.672
Corporate wants him
to come and help out.

08:27.707 --> 08:32.610
Fiona, I could've jumped in
on this.

08:32.645 --> 08:34.179
True, I've never worked
with cookware,

08:34.214 --> 08:35.813
but I could get up
to speed fast.

08:35.849 --> 08:36.815
I'm local, I have...

08:36.850 --> 08:39.116
Elle, while I know you
would add a lot to this,

08:39.152 --> 08:42.854
you have worked hard,
and you deserve a break.

08:42.889 --> 08:44.188
But Maxwell Turner?

08:44.224 --> 08:48.126
First of all, he's terrible in email,
worse on the phone.

08:48.161 --> 08:50.695
I know.
Wonder what he's like in person.

08:50.730 --> 08:53.765
So, what can I do to help?

08:53.800 --> 08:56.367
It's Sunday.
You go home.

08:56.403 --> 08:58.169
This is a mess,
we're gonna be on it

08:58.205 --> 08:59.838
probably right up to Christmas.

08:59.873 --> 09:03.541
But I can review something.

09:03.577 --> 09:06.244
I can take a look at a mock-up,
or something?

09:06.279 --> 09:09.347
This is about the creative
director position.

09:09.382 --> 09:12.851
Elle, you've already proven
yourself a great employee.

09:12.886 --> 09:13.551
But that job...

09:13.587 --> 09:18.823
Is a bit of a reach, I know.
But, I'm ready for it.

09:18.859 --> 09:22.894
Okay. So, what would
your take be?

09:22.929 --> 09:25.430
First of all, those ads
just show the cookware,

09:25.465 --> 09:28.366
but it should be about
how the cookware is used

09:28.401 --> 09:29.267
by actual people.

09:29.302 --> 09:33.037
And that's something you
can do online, really easily.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.573
And you're offering to dive in
on a job that's long hours

09:35.609 --> 09:37.675
and technically difficult,
because?

09:37.711 --> 09:41.579
Because I know I can do it.

09:41.615 --> 09:44.449
And help you in the process.

09:44.484 --> 09:49.687
- And that's a bargaining skill that...
- You taught me, yes.

09:50.590 --> 09:53.491
Fiona, I want to grow here.

09:56.029 --> 09:58.897
There's a brainstorming meeting
tomorrow morning.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.332
Come prepared.

10:01.368 --> 10:02.967
Thank you.

10:03.003 --> 10:03.768
And, if I...

10:03.803 --> 10:06.704
I'm not promising anything yet.

10:06.740 --> 10:09.974
Bring some ideas, the interviews
are this Friday.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.409
It won't be easy.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.611
But, if the partners like
your ideas...

10:13.647 --> 10:16.781
Don't worry, I'm gonna nail it.

10:16.816 --> 10:19.517
Nobody should worry.
Who's worried?

10:19.552 --> 10:21.953
I'm not worried.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.158
Don't get me wrong,
I love what I do.

10:27.193 --> 10:30.361
But, this would mean getting
to use all of my skills,

10:30.397 --> 10:32.263
not just the digital ones.

10:32.299 --> 10:35.266
Business, creative, budgeting.

10:35.302 --> 10:38.436
Yeah, plus managing people.
It'd be great.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.149
Just means you won't get much
time off between

10:40.173 --> 10:45.176
putting this campaign together
and planning this party.

10:45.211 --> 10:48.012
I am not worried.
I always get it done.

10:48.048 --> 10:51.015
I'm excited to come decorate
the coffee shop with you.

10:51.051 --> 10:52.750
Yeah, me too.

10:52.786 --> 10:56.054
Hey, don't stay up
too late, okay?

10:56.089 --> 10:57.188
I won't.

10:57.223 --> 10:58.323
Kay, see you tomorrow.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.858
- Bye.
- Bye.

11:15.408 --> 11:17.608
Well.

11:17.644 --> 11:21.713
I have got a few of those,
Maxwell Turner.

11:34.427 --> 11:36.138
<i>And while I know we don't
have a lot of time</i>

11:36.162 --> 11:37.695
<i>to come up with a new ad,</i>

11:37.731 --> 11:39.998
<i>the fact is, we're up against
Christmas.</i>

11:40.033 --> 11:42.000
<i>People want to know
what to give as a gift.</i>

11:42.035 --> 11:44.402
I would say more than that,
people want to make sure

11:44.437 --> 11:47.271
they're giving a quality
product.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.907
<i>Sorry, who is that speaking?</i>

11:49.943 --> 11:52.410
Hi Maxwell, I'm Elle Bennett.

11:52.445 --> 11:53.911
Chicago office.

11:53.947 --> 11:58.483
I enjoy your emails, they are
very direct and to the point.

11:58.518 --> 12:02.520
I have an idea that expands the
campaign using social media

12:02.555 --> 12:03.688
and traditional...

12:03.723 --> 12:05.501
<i>No, the social media route
lets our market respond,</i>

12:05.525 --> 12:07.158
<i>opens us up to more criticism.</i>

12:07.193 --> 12:08.292
<i>The last thing we want...</i>

12:08.328 --> 12:11.629
I think that you would be
surprised at how adaptable

12:11.664 --> 12:13.898
and fast social media can be.

12:13.933 --> 12:17.635
The heart of Christmas
is bringing people together

12:17.670 --> 12:20.471
and sharing moments, which is
something that digital campaigns

12:20.507 --> 12:22.774
do best.

12:22.809 --> 12:24.308
<i>So, what exactly do you propose?</i>

12:24.344 --> 12:27.512
<i>Because we have two days
to launch.</i>

12:27.547 --> 12:29.047
Glad you asked.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.649
So, you have a commercial
that look like

12:31.684 --> 12:33.384
someone else's commercial.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.852
We don't need to shoot
a new one.

12:34.888 --> 12:37.522
Just expand the idea online.

12:37.557 --> 12:41.626
I put together a mock-up
of some still images.

12:41.661 --> 12:45.063
But the main idea is a series
of short videos.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.832
We show a host using
the cookware

12:47.867 --> 12:51.169
so it feels different and bigger
than the competitor's.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.137
"Not all pots are
created equal".

12:53.173 --> 12:58.709
"Century Cookware,
made for real people".

12:58.745 --> 13:00.144
I like this, Elle.

13:00.180 --> 13:02.080
Max, your thoughts?

13:02.115 --> 13:05.483
<i>Yeah, it's kind of interesting,
it's a little thin,</i>

13:05.518 --> 13:08.653
<i>I feel like it needs something,...</i>

13:11.091 --> 13:14.192
<i>Guys, I'm kind of
in the middle of...</i>

13:14.227 --> 13:16.994
<i>I, I'm gonna have to...</i>

13:20.300 --> 13:24.902
Max? Max?

13:24.938 --> 13:27.572
Okay, so we have lost Max.

13:27.607 --> 13:32.076
Let's take an hour for lunch
and come back refreshed, yes?

13:35.482 --> 13:37.281
Great job.

13:37.317 --> 13:40.218
I want you to work with Max
on it.

13:40.253 --> 13:42.153
Is that going to be a problem?

13:42.188 --> 13:43.988
I'm a professional.

13:44.023 --> 13:46.924
He is also a professional.

13:53.900 --> 13:55.967
Thank you.

13:56.002 --> 13:56.701
Hi.

13:56.736 --> 13:57.969
Hello, welcome back.

13:58.004 --> 14:01.405
Ooh, so, I know that you were
here just the other day, but...

14:01.441 --> 14:02.240
I'm Elle.

14:02.275 --> 14:03.674
Elle, right.

14:03.710 --> 14:05.409
And you're Nancy, right?

14:05.445 --> 14:06.244
Yes.

14:06.279 --> 14:08.146
I like the new look
for your booth.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.413
Thank you.

14:09.449 --> 14:12.517
Yeah, my son said I had to get
better at catching customers.

14:12.552 --> 14:14.385
Well, a little marketing
never hurt.

14:14.420 --> 14:16.120
That's what he says.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.656
And, I think he's right.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.926
I've had so many more customers
since that sign went up.

14:21.961 --> 14:23.661
Better than my old
marketing plan.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.062
Which was?

14:25.098 --> 14:26.130
Christmas magic.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.767
Let me get your ornament.

14:32.272 --> 14:33.905
This one's for my friend Kate.

14:33.940 --> 14:36.607
She just had her first child
this year.

14:36.643 --> 14:38.176
And this one?

14:38.211 --> 14:39.377
That's for my tree.

14:39.412 --> 14:42.180
I get myself one each year.

14:42.215 --> 14:42.914
Well no one's ever asked me

14:42.949 --> 14:45.783
to make a laptop
ornament before,

14:45.818 --> 14:47.351
but I had a lot of fun
making it.

14:47.387 --> 14:51.255
It's the only thing that I could
think of that summed up my year.

14:51.291 --> 14:52.890
So you work with computers?

14:52.926 --> 14:53.824
Fingers crossed

14:53.860 --> 14:55.960
I'll be moving into a leadership
role soon,

14:55.995 --> 14:59.030
but, yeah, websites,
social media.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.965
My son tells me I should
have a website,

15:01.000 --> 15:03.167
but I'm not convinced.

15:03.203 --> 15:04.969
They're really easy to make.

15:05.004 --> 15:06.070
Really?

15:06.105 --> 15:09.774
I mean, it would be nice to sell
some more ornaments.

15:09.809 --> 15:12.777
Well, you know, you could
take photos of the ornaments,

15:12.812 --> 15:13.945
make a few posts.

15:13.980 --> 15:14.990
That's what I keep telling her.

15:15.014 --> 15:16.981
You see, mom?

15:17.984 --> 15:19.584
It's you.

15:19.619 --> 15:22.453
It is me, yeah.
And it's you.

15:23.056 --> 15:24.722
You two know each other.

15:24.757 --> 15:25.890
Yeah.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.559
We've seen each other around
at the coffee shop and...

15:28.595 --> 15:31.329
This is the coffee shop girl.

15:31.364 --> 15:32.330
Mom.

15:32.365 --> 15:35.633
She can... you're not whispering
quietly at all.

15:35.668 --> 15:39.837
I'm glad to know that you're
related to Nancy.

15:39.872 --> 15:40.838
I mean, that's a...

15:40.873 --> 15:41.639
It's a coincidence.

15:41.674 --> 15:45.743
Yeah, a huge coincidence, yeah.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.712
My son is also in advertising.

15:47.747 --> 15:50.348
Yeah, he made the new sign.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.316
Where do you work?

15:52.352 --> 15:53.284
I'm based in New York.

15:53.319 --> 15:55.987
They think I'm here
in our Chicago office,

15:56.022 --> 15:58.522
and the Chicago office thinks
I haven't arrived yet,

15:58.558 --> 16:01.392
just so I could help Mom
with the booth...

16:01.427 --> 16:03.694
It's a good strategy.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.596
Hey, we haven't...

16:05.632 --> 16:08.866
Right. I'm Elle.

16:08.901 --> 16:11.469
Elle Bennett.

16:11.504 --> 16:14.505
From... Szabo & Bezanis?

16:14.540 --> 16:16.173
Newly working on...

16:16.209 --> 16:21.145
Cookware. Yes.

16:21.180 --> 16:23.447
Wait.

16:23.483 --> 16:27.718
You're... Max Turner,
aren't you?

16:28.554 --> 16:30.921
Christmas magic.

16:36.229 --> 16:40.898
So, the Chicago office thinks
you're in New York,

16:40.933 --> 16:43.634
and the New York office thinks
you're...

16:43.670 --> 16:44.335
Now, wait.

16:44.370 --> 16:46.037
I told you that in confidence.

16:46.072 --> 16:47.738
I don't think you did.

16:47.774 --> 16:48.439
All right, fine.

16:48.474 --> 16:50.041
But please don't blow my cover.

16:50.076 --> 16:51.309
Wait a second.

16:51.344 --> 16:54.779
I was in the office pitching you
an idea that I worked hard on,

16:54.814 --> 16:56.047
and you were...

16:56.082 --> 16:59.050
I was working, and I was
supposed to be off

16:59.085 --> 17:01.652
celebrating Christmas
with my family.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.654
So to help mom at the booth,
I...

17:03.690 --> 17:06.223
No, no, you leave me
out of this.

17:06.259 --> 17:08.125
And can you two have
this conversation

17:08.161 --> 17:10.493
in front of another booth,
please?

17:10.530 --> 17:12.040
You're gonna be all right here
by yourself?

17:12.065 --> 17:13.931
I've been working this booth
for 20 years,

17:13.965 --> 17:17.435
three years by myself, so yeah,
I think I'm gonna be okay.

17:17.470 --> 17:19.002
You go on.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.971
Why don't you give me
those bags?

17:21.007 --> 17:22.007
Are you sure?

17:22.040 --> 17:23.574
Yes, I am sure.

17:24.944 --> 17:27.411
Now, off you go.

17:27.446 --> 17:28.979
Thanks, mom.

17:29.015 --> 17:31.649
The fact is, video online can be
made much faster

17:31.684 --> 17:32.817
than it can for on the air.

17:32.852 --> 17:35.953
We find a host,
someone relatable.

17:35.988 --> 17:37.154
We can shoot them quickly,

17:37.190 --> 17:40.791
and... why aren't you
interrupting me?

17:40.827 --> 17:42.993
I'm listening, why would I
interrupt you?

17:43.029 --> 17:46.530
Well, because...
that's been your thing.

17:46.566 --> 17:47.698
That's not my thing.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.300
Everyone says it's your thing.

17:49.335 --> 17:50.534
Everyone?

17:50.570 --> 17:52.536
Yes.

17:52.572 --> 17:57.074
Grouchy fixer of ad campaigns.

17:57.110 --> 17:59.276
You're very brusque in emails.

17:59.312 --> 18:00.945
I'm efficient.

18:00.980 --> 18:02.613
You interrupt people
on the phone.

18:02.648 --> 18:05.116
To be fair, the phone
is not a great way

18:05.151 --> 18:06.050
to do anything anymore.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.819
No, no, no I know,
the phone is the worst.

18:11.157 --> 18:12.923
This is weird, right?

18:12.959 --> 18:15.326
First the coffee shop thing
and now...

18:15.361 --> 18:19.563
A little.

18:19.599 --> 18:22.032
But at least we figured it
out before...

18:22.068 --> 18:24.735
Yeah, right, now we can
just focus on the work.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.003
Right.

18:26.038 --> 18:28.105
And look, Fiona
likes your video idea.

18:28.141 --> 18:30.574
But I think it needs to be
more aspirational.

18:30.610 --> 18:34.078
People want to know what kind
of gifts the pros are giving.

18:34.113 --> 18:37.348
That's why I think it needs
a celebrity host.

18:37.383 --> 18:38.682
I disagree.

18:38.718 --> 18:42.319
I think that a celebrity
host can alienate people,

18:42.355 --> 18:45.890
make them feel like they're not
a good enough cook.

18:45.925 --> 18:48.759
I'm not sure about that.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.094
You wanna bet?

18:50.129 --> 18:51.629
No.

18:51.664 --> 18:53.164
Wait, what?

19:00.173 --> 19:02.606
Sir, excuse me. Sir.

19:02.642 --> 19:05.643
If we each made a wreath,

19:05.678 --> 19:07.678
would you tell us
which one is better?

19:07.713 --> 19:09.880
Yes, absolutely.

19:09.916 --> 19:14.218
I say nice things about all
the wreaths people make here.

19:14.253 --> 19:16.987
But secretly, I judge.

19:17.023 --> 19:22.059
Not yours of course.

19:22.094 --> 19:23.027
You in?

19:23.062 --> 19:25.062
This isn't how decisions
like this are made.

19:25.097 --> 19:28.165
We have to look at market
research and focus groups.

19:28.201 --> 19:31.836
Well, if we had time, sure, but
when you have too much to do

19:31.871 --> 19:33.537
and equally good plans,

19:33.573 --> 19:38.409
sometimes you just gotta
wreath it up.

19:40.813 --> 19:42.513
All right. You're on.

19:42.548 --> 19:44.949
We'll go with the idea of
whoever makes the best wreath

19:44.984 --> 19:47.751
according to him.

19:49.388 --> 19:50.388
Deal.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.757
Do you want me to time you?

19:53.793 --> 19:56.527
How seriously are you
taking this?

19:56.562 --> 19:58.062
Very seriously.

19:58.097 --> 20:00.898
Best wreath within 20 minutes?

20:04.437 --> 20:06.504
You're one of those Christmas
people, huh?

20:06.539 --> 20:09.540
Tree goes up day
after Thanksgiving,

20:09.575 --> 20:13.410
you got a Christmas village you
put on the mantle every year,

20:13.446 --> 20:15.613
you stay up late on Christmas
Eve drinking hot cocoa

20:15.648 --> 20:18.349
and waiting for Santa and his,
what do you call em,

20:18.384 --> 20:20.551
Christmas Llamas?

20:20.586 --> 20:21.552
You mean reindeer?

20:21.587 --> 20:23.687
Right, reindeer.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.122
I'm kidding, that was a...

20:25.157 --> 20:27.157
I obviously know
what reindeer are.

20:27.193 --> 20:28.926
Let me guess.

20:28.961 --> 20:32.463
You are one of those "meh,
just another day" types.

20:33.733 --> 20:37.601
Show up at the Christmas party
dressed as a dapper Scrooge.

20:37.637 --> 20:39.837
Refuses to wear
an ironic sweater.

20:39.872 --> 20:42.273
Actually, I didn't hear anything
after "dapper".

20:42.308 --> 20:45.643
And those Christmas parties are
great networking opportunities.

20:45.678 --> 20:49.079
Christmas parties
are when you get to see

20:49.115 --> 20:51.815
a different side of people.

20:51.851 --> 20:55.686
You treat them less like
a co-worker or friend,

20:55.721 --> 21:02.326
they become, I dunno, family.

21:02.361 --> 21:03.627
Yeah.

21:03.663 --> 21:05.796
That part's pretty great.

21:06.866 --> 21:09.833
That is... okay.

21:11.003 --> 21:12.236
All right.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.281
It's not that bad.

21:24.317 --> 21:25.317
Hey.

21:25.351 --> 21:27.151
Nobody said bad.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.288
You tried.

21:31.324 --> 21:33.824
That's the important thing.

21:36.062 --> 21:39.330
Okay. Fair is fair.

21:39.365 --> 21:40.365
You win.

21:42.435 --> 21:47.571
We will do a series of
celebrity chef hosted videos,

21:47.607 --> 21:50.374
but we keep them relatable.

21:50.409 --> 21:51.275
Well, there we're in luck.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.377
Because Julia Wise
and Rachel Richards

21:53.412 --> 21:55.946
are both in town doing press
for their cookbooks.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.815
Wait, Julia Wise?

21:57.850 --> 22:00.184
I love Julia Wise.

22:00.219 --> 22:03.654
I watch her Christmas special
every year.

22:03.689 --> 22:06.090
Rachel Richards is amazing.

22:06.125 --> 22:07.691
Great, I'm gonna make
some calls.

22:07.727 --> 22:11.729
I'm gonna head back to work
and figure out a shoot.

22:11.764 --> 22:14.465
And will you not blow
my cover at work?

22:14.500 --> 22:16.066
That I'm here pretending
to be there?

22:16.102 --> 22:18.035
Just because I'm helping my mom
with her booth...

22:18.070 --> 22:19.603
No, I get it.

22:19.639 --> 22:25.042
"Just landed in Chicago.
Meeting with Elle soon". Send.

22:25.077 --> 22:30.781
Okay. So, I'll see you soon.

22:30.816 --> 22:32.316
Yep.

22:48.034 --> 22:48.599
Kate,

22:48.634 --> 22:49.166
<i>Hi.</i>

22:49.201 --> 22:50.968
I can't wait to see you.

22:51.003 --> 22:52.503
This year's Misfit
Christmas Party

22:52.538 --> 22:54.271
is totally coming together.

22:54.306 --> 22:56.573
Elle, that's what I'm calling
you about.

22:56.609 --> 22:57.574
So it turns out Jason's family

22:57.610 --> 23:00.744
scheduled their Christmas party
for Saturday,

23:00.780 --> 23:01.890
I hate to be the one
that messes things up,

23:01.914 --> 23:05.215
but is there any way that we can
do Friday night instead?

23:05.251 --> 23:08.152
Sure. Yeah, I'll just check in
with everyone else.

23:08.187 --> 23:10.087
Elle, you don't have to do that.

23:10.122 --> 23:12.089
I'll call some people
and find out.

23:12.124 --> 23:14.858
Really Kate.
It's no big deal.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.462
I can't wait for you
to meet the baby.

23:18.497 --> 23:20.764
But for now, I have
to change her.

23:20.800 --> 23:21.832
See you soon.

23:21.867 --> 23:23.434
Kay, bye!

23:25.104 --> 23:26.537
Okay.

23:32.445 --> 23:34.078
You got this, girl.

23:49.628 --> 23:50.628
Hey.

23:50.663 --> 23:51.562
Hey!

23:51.597 --> 23:53.497
Let me help you with that.

23:56.368 --> 24:00.304
That sweater is both
great and terrible.

24:00.339 --> 24:01.238
Right?

24:01.273 --> 24:03.040
My staff does this Christmas
sweater day.

24:03.075 --> 24:06.143
It's nuts, but I kind
of love it.

24:08.714 --> 24:11.048
I figured it was best to leave
some of these here now,

24:11.083 --> 24:14.251
and then I'll bring the rest
when we decorate.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.719
Decorate.

24:15.755 --> 24:16.286
But...

24:16.322 --> 24:18.756
Just like, a tad more?

24:18.791 --> 24:20.157
Okay, sure.

24:20.192 --> 24:22.126
And then...

24:22.161 --> 24:24.595
Because we've moved the party
from Saturday to Friday...

24:24.630 --> 24:28.599
Elle. You don't have
to do this by yourself.

24:28.634 --> 24:31.135
I know.

24:34.373 --> 24:35.072
Hey.

24:35.107 --> 24:35.906
Good morning.

24:35.941 --> 24:36.707
Hey.

24:36.742 --> 24:37.742
Is he here yet?

24:37.777 --> 24:38.509
Who?

24:38.544 --> 24:39.243
Who else?

24:39.278 --> 24:40.210
Christmas romance coffee guy

24:40.246 --> 24:43.547
turned surprise grouchy
Christmas co-worker.

24:44.116 --> 24:45.116
We heard.

24:46.018 --> 24:48.552
Okay.
I gotta go.

24:48.587 --> 24:51.522
Have. A good.

24:51.557 --> 24:52.156
Day.

24:52.191 --> 24:53.357
You. Too.

24:55.895 --> 24:57.773
Every year she gets herself
worked up over this,

24:57.797 --> 25:00.230
and every year it's
the best party ever.

25:00.266 --> 25:01.565
Yeah.

25:01.600 --> 25:03.967
Well, we all fly off
to see family,

25:04.003 --> 25:05.669
or you know, have them
come to us.

25:05.704 --> 25:09.740
But for Elle, we're her family.

25:21.587 --> 25:23.954
It's very...

25:23.989 --> 25:24.855
...Elegant.

25:24.890 --> 25:26.323
It's tasteful.

25:26.358 --> 25:27.903
It's the kind of place
people want to live in.

25:27.927 --> 25:30.460
Plus, it showcases the cookware.

25:30.496 --> 25:32.596
But these are holiday videos.

25:32.631 --> 25:34.064
People want colour.

25:34.099 --> 25:35.365
Life.

25:35.401 --> 25:36.600
Reality.

25:36.635 --> 25:39.536
I mean, this is like Christmas
in one of those ice hotels.

25:39.572 --> 25:41.238
It's very...

25:41.273 --> 25:42.773
Sparse?

25:42.808 --> 25:45.175
Yes, I told him that too.

25:45.211 --> 25:46.610
I do a lot of entertaining here,

25:46.645 --> 25:50.514
so I keep it a little blank
and I add things as I go.

25:50.549 --> 25:51.648
Hi, I'm Oakley.

25:51.684 --> 25:53.450
I'm this guy's sister.

25:53.485 --> 25:54.585
I'm Elle.

25:54.620 --> 25:56.920
Thank you so much for
letting us use your space.

25:56.956 --> 25:58.422
It is beautiful.

25:58.457 --> 25:59.556
I just...

25:59.592 --> 26:00.858
Yeah, no, no, no.
I get it.

26:00.893 --> 26:02.693
I know exactly
what you're going for.

26:02.728 --> 26:03.694
Oak is a party planner.

26:03.729 --> 26:06.196
She's setting up the firm's
Christmas party.

26:06.232 --> 26:07.331
It's gonna be so great.

26:07.366 --> 26:10.067
It's that giant space next
to the ice rink downtown.

26:10.102 --> 26:12.202
I am obsessed with that place.

26:12.238 --> 26:15.372
It's got that gorgeous
atrium upstairs.

26:16.508 --> 26:18.320
I admire anyone who does
party planning for a living,

26:18.344 --> 26:20.210
cause, man, is it tough.

26:20.246 --> 26:22.946
Well, the key is the food.

26:22.982 --> 26:23.982
And good wine.

26:25.017 --> 26:28.252
Now, this place is gonna need
decorations and colour

26:28.287 --> 26:30.254
if you're gonna shoot
a Christmas video here.

26:30.289 --> 26:31.588
I like Oakley.

26:31.624 --> 26:32.890
Oakley gets it.

26:32.925 --> 26:35.392
Lead the way, Christmas expert.

26:35.427 --> 26:37.494
First thing's first.

26:37.529 --> 26:39.563
Okay, I am gonna look
at the Frasier Firs,

26:39.598 --> 26:42.032
you guys take the Blue
Spruce aisle,

26:42.067 --> 26:44.368
and we'll find two that match.

26:44.403 --> 26:45.969
All right, yell if you
see something.

26:46.005 --> 26:47.437
Okay.

26:48.340 --> 26:50.240
It smells amazing here.

26:50.276 --> 26:53.210
Yeah, it's like getting lost
in a forest.

26:53.245 --> 26:56.113
It looks like we had
our first stumble.

26:56.148 --> 26:57.681
Julia Wise is out.

26:57.716 --> 26:58.782
What?

26:58.817 --> 27:01.485
I was looking forward to that.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.287
Rachel Richards is still on
board, though?

27:03.322 --> 27:04.955
As of now, yeah.

27:04.990 --> 27:05.789
Okay.

27:05.824 --> 27:08.258
Here, Merry Christmas.

27:08.294 --> 27:10.527
That was nice of you.

27:10.562 --> 27:13.163
I'm not a total scrooge.

27:13.198 --> 27:15.732
I think my words were
"dapper scrooge".

27:15.768 --> 27:17.301
Yeah. They were.

27:18.604 --> 27:21.538
So are your folks here
in Chicago too?

27:21.573 --> 27:23.807
I was raised by my grandmother.

27:23.842 --> 27:25.876
She passed when
I was in college,

27:25.911 --> 27:28.779
so since then,
it's just been me.

27:30.015 --> 27:31.448
I have a tight group of friends,

27:31.483 --> 27:33.984
and every year we
throw ourselves a party,

27:34.019 --> 27:36.787
exchange gifts, eat a ton.

27:36.822 --> 27:39.356
And then after that, we
all scatter off for Christmas,

27:39.391 --> 27:41.892
some travel and some
have folks in town,

27:41.927 --> 27:45.562
but yeah, we started it
in college.

27:45.597 --> 27:47.130
You kept it going every year?

27:47.166 --> 27:49.766
The last few years have been
smaller parties,

27:49.802 --> 27:53.036
cause people have moved away
and started their own families,

27:53.072 --> 27:55.706
so it's harder to make work, but

27:55.741 --> 27:57.474
this year's shaping up
to be big.

27:57.509 --> 28:00.210
It's cool, keeping a tradition.

28:00.245 --> 28:01.178
Yeah.

28:01.213 --> 28:02.079
What about you?

28:02.114 --> 28:03.013
You spend it with your mom
and sister?

28:03.048 --> 28:05.349
And aunts and uncles
and everybody, yeah.

28:05.384 --> 28:07.195
Last few years I've been helping
Mom with her booth

28:07.219 --> 28:09.619
since Dad passed.

28:09.655 --> 28:11.221
Which by the way,

28:11.256 --> 28:14.891
my mom hasn't stopped talking
about building her on website.

28:14.927 --> 28:16.626
We've been telling her
to do it for years,

28:16.662 --> 28:20.263
but apparently meeting an expert
has really changed her mind.

28:20.299 --> 28:25.102
Well, I'm happy I can put
my expertise to use.

28:25.137 --> 28:26.370
Your mom's ornaments

28:26.405 --> 28:28.839
are one of my favourite
Christmas traditions,

28:28.874 --> 28:32.909
so more people should know
about them.

28:32.945 --> 28:33.710
Yeah.

28:33.746 --> 28:35.112
Found them.

28:37.783 --> 28:40.017
They're perfect.

28:40.052 --> 28:42.419
And we know exactly where
to get the ornaments.

28:43.355 --> 28:44.287
But let's delegate that
to someone else,

28:44.323 --> 28:45.834
cause we've got to get
these trees back in

28:45.858 --> 28:47.057
and revise the scripts.

28:47.092 --> 28:50.627
Or we could make sure it's done
right by doing it ourselves.

28:50.662 --> 28:51.728
But we don't have time.

28:51.764 --> 28:54.598
We do, if we use
the time wisely.

28:54.633 --> 28:57.100
Except we're lugging
these trees around.

28:57.136 --> 29:00.270
I'll help Elle, we'll grab a cab
to the Christmas fair

29:00.305 --> 29:04.174
and you can take the trees
back and put the lights on them.

29:05.344 --> 29:07.878
I like her more and more.

29:07.913 --> 29:09.613
All right.

29:10.816 --> 29:12.315
All right.

29:12.351 --> 29:13.316
See you with the ornaments.

29:13.352 --> 29:14.618
Yeah.

29:14.653 --> 29:16.219
See ya.

29:21.126 --> 29:22.826
Still, 20 years.

29:22.861 --> 29:24.261
That's a long time.

29:24.296 --> 29:25.262
Yup.

29:25.297 --> 29:27.264
I was practically raised
in this Christmas fair.

29:27.299 --> 29:31.101
This is where I do most of my
Christmas shopping every year.

29:32.204 --> 29:33.882
Yeah, for my gifts, for
the party with my friends.

29:33.906 --> 29:36.173
Hey, if you ever need
help with that,

29:36.208 --> 29:38.075
party planning's my thing,
I could easily...

29:38.110 --> 29:40.977
I appreciate it,
but I think I've got it.

29:41.013 --> 29:46.349
Or, if I don't, then my friends
seem to be picking up my slack.

29:46.385 --> 29:48.018
You okay?

29:48.053 --> 29:49.519
Yeah.

29:49.555 --> 29:51.388
Yeah, just feeling
a little guilty

29:51.423 --> 29:53.990
about having to juggle
so many things.

29:55.027 --> 29:57.527
It all somehow gets done,
it just,

29:57.563 --> 30:01.364
it would be nice to have a
little more space, you know?

30:02.468 --> 30:05.168
Well, don't underestimate
the power of delegating

30:05.204 --> 30:06.703
to the right people.

30:06.738 --> 30:07.637
If there's one thing
I've learned,

30:07.673 --> 30:09.606
it's to know when you're doing
too much.

30:11.210 --> 30:12.275
Hi, Mom.

30:12.311 --> 30:14.544
Well, look at this.

30:14.580 --> 30:17.247
A little bird told me to get you
some ornaments.

30:17.282 --> 30:18.682
Tasteful ones, he said.

30:18.717 --> 30:19.483
Colourful.

30:19.518 --> 30:21.551
Something that will pop
on screen.

30:21.587 --> 30:23.420
Something like this?

30:23.455 --> 30:25.622
Oh my goodness,
they are perfect, Nancy.

30:25.657 --> 30:26.990
Thank you.

30:27.025 --> 30:27.757
How much do we owe you?

30:27.793 --> 30:28.793
Oh, no. No, no, no.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.227
This is on me.

30:30.262 --> 30:31.061
Nancy.

30:31.096 --> 30:32.996
I mean, at least let us
pay you for...

30:33.031 --> 30:34.264
No, listen.

30:34.299 --> 30:36.299
We're decorating our tree
on Wednesday,

30:36.335 --> 30:38.535
and you can pay me back
by coming to Glenco

30:38.570 --> 30:40.103
to help us out.

30:40.139 --> 30:42.472
I wouldn't want to intrude.

30:42.508 --> 30:43.340
No.

30:43.375 --> 30:45.408
That word does not exist
in our house.

30:45.444 --> 30:47.878
You have to come.

30:47.913 --> 30:49.279
Thank you.

30:49.314 --> 30:51.014
In that case, I insist.

30:51.049 --> 30:53.817
Let me make you a website.

30:53.852 --> 30:54.852
Okay.

30:55.888 --> 30:56.888
Oh, here.

31:00.125 --> 31:01.758
Hey, Fiona.
What's up?

31:01.793 --> 31:04.027
Wanted to let you know that
the partners heard

31:04.062 --> 31:06.530
about your campaign ideas
for Century Cookware.

31:06.565 --> 31:08.899
<i>They said they like the way
you think,</i>

31:08.934 --> 31:11.368
and gave you a spot
on the interview list

31:11.403 --> 31:12.435
for Friday afternoon.

31:12.471 --> 31:14.471
Really? That's great.

31:14.506 --> 31:17.874
Yes, also, heads up, the
interview process requires

31:17.910 --> 31:19.009
a presentation.

31:19.044 --> 31:20.955
<i>They want you to come in
prepared with something</i>

31:20.979 --> 31:22.512
that highlights
what you do best.

31:22.548 --> 31:23.613
I can do it.

31:25.851 --> 31:26.783
Good news?

31:26.818 --> 31:29.419
Just, putting more things
on my list.

31:29.454 --> 31:31.188
Shall we start decorating?

31:31.223 --> 31:32.389
We shall.

31:32.424 --> 31:34.624
- See you Wednesday.
- Okay.

31:34.660 --> 31:35.660
Okay.

31:39.231 --> 31:41.398
I have to admit,
this is festive.

31:43.969 --> 31:45.202
It's Rachel.

31:45.237 --> 31:46.603
Hey, Rachel.

31:46.638 --> 31:48.338
Did you get the scripts
we sent over?

31:48.373 --> 31:49.706
We're excited to...

31:53.412 --> 31:58.215
No, I understand, can we send
something over to...?

31:58.250 --> 31:59.282
I understand.

31:59.318 --> 32:02.586
No, thank you.

32:02.621 --> 32:04.988
Rachel Richards has the flu.

32:05.023 --> 32:06.423
Oh no.

32:08.627 --> 32:09.926
So we're...

32:09.962 --> 32:12.529
...back to square one.

32:24.009 --> 32:27.244
Well, we basically decorated
your sister's place.

32:27.279 --> 32:28.545
Yeah.

32:28.580 --> 32:32.782
And no celebrity chef,
so you got your way.

32:32.818 --> 32:34.284
All right, so we regroup.

32:34.319 --> 32:37.287
Maybe shoot some still photos
of the cookware.

32:43.428 --> 32:45.128
I didn't know you cooked.

32:45.163 --> 32:47.397
Yeah, my mom taught me.

32:47.432 --> 32:49.466
She's always been amazing
in the kitchen.

32:49.501 --> 32:52.469
She makes this green bean
casserole at Christmas

32:52.504 --> 32:56.206
that's just... I mean, you'd...
It's incredible.

32:57.409 --> 32:59.442
How finely can you dice?

33:01.980 --> 33:03.146
There we are.

33:03.181 --> 33:05.226
So your mom taught you how
to make gourmet grilled cheese?

33:05.250 --> 33:07.651
Nah, this one's all me.

33:07.686 --> 33:10.587
Also, I have to say, this
cookware is not half bad.

33:10.622 --> 33:11.554
I have their pie dish.

33:11.590 --> 33:15.492
I've always been more of
a baker than a chef.

33:15.527 --> 33:17.527
Oh yeah? What's
your specialty?

33:17.562 --> 33:19.195
Pecan pie.

33:19.231 --> 33:20.764
My grandma's recipe.

33:20.799 --> 33:22.032
Nice.

33:22.067 --> 33:23.707
I gotta admit, it would
have been so great

33:23.735 --> 33:25.268
to see a pro in action today.

33:25.304 --> 33:27.604
So you could steal some moves
for your own

33:27.639 --> 33:29.272
Elle Bennett cooking show?

33:30.175 --> 33:32.309
Yeah, something like that.

33:32.344 --> 33:35.111
Well, I guess we'll just have
to figure something else out.

33:35.147 --> 33:36.046
Yeah.

33:36.081 --> 33:37.147
Okay, team.

33:37.182 --> 33:39.582
You both keep solving
your own problem.

33:39.618 --> 33:41.885
I'd watch an Elle Bennett
cooking show.

33:41.920 --> 33:43.987
Just do that.

33:44.022 --> 33:44.621
What?

33:44.656 --> 33:47.457
Same idea, except we have.

33:47.492 --> 33:49.326
...no host at all.

33:49.361 --> 33:51.861
It's not a series
of hosted videos,

33:51.897 --> 33:54.297
it's just real people talking,

33:54.333 --> 33:56.900
making recipes
and uploading them.

33:56.935 --> 33:58.234
Like an online recipe circle.

33:58.270 --> 34:00.537
Yeah, yeah! I can make
a fast web-page

34:00.572 --> 34:03.373
and then people can start
posting videos and share them.

34:03.408 --> 34:05.875
And we could use a crew to film
the first post,

34:05.911 --> 34:07.510
with a real person.

34:07.546 --> 34:12.282
So we get this real person...
from where?

34:17.822 --> 34:20.389
Are we sure it should be me?

34:20.425 --> 34:24.893
Why not Oakley, or why not...
what's your name?

34:24.929 --> 34:26.463
Because, if you'll recall,

34:26.498 --> 34:29.933
it was your idea to use
someone relatable.

34:29.967 --> 34:32.635
Yes, I agree.

34:35.072 --> 34:36.873
But what if I'm terrible?

34:36.908 --> 34:39.141
We'll just tell you.

34:39.177 --> 34:39.976
I'm kidding.

34:40.011 --> 34:41.311
You're gonna be great.

34:41.346 --> 34:42.556
There's not even that many
people here.

34:42.581 --> 34:45.681
Just show us all an example of
someone who loves Christmas.

34:50.522 --> 34:52.054
Hi, come on up.

34:52.090 --> 34:56.292
And I am gonna call Fiona
and tell her about the change.

35:00.132 --> 35:02.665
Hi.

35:02.701 --> 35:03.701
Hello.

35:04.269 --> 35:06.269
I'm here for Elle Bennett?

35:06.304 --> 35:09.239
Yeah, she, she's
in the makeup chair.

35:09.274 --> 35:11.641
Right, great.

35:11.676 --> 35:12.642
Hi.

35:12.677 --> 35:15.645
I work with words,
at the same place,

35:15.680 --> 35:19.082
editing scripts and...
I'm Jay.

35:19.117 --> 35:21.251
Oakley, nice to meet you.

35:21.286 --> 35:22.286
Nice to meet you.

35:24.089 --> 35:25.288
Jay, hi.

35:25.323 --> 35:29.125
I'm so sorry, I didn't tell you
that the plans have changed.

35:29.161 --> 35:31.995
Oh, no, no big deal at all.

35:32.030 --> 35:35.498
I don't know how they talked me
into this.

35:35.534 --> 35:36.699
You do the videos?

35:37.669 --> 35:39.269
That's so smart, you...

35:39.304 --> 35:40.270
No, that's so smart.

35:40.305 --> 35:42.405
You're smart, you're funny,
you're charming.

35:42.441 --> 35:44.574
You're gonna do great.

35:44.609 --> 35:48.011
Well, here goes nothing.

35:56.121 --> 35:57.887
Okay.

35:57.923 --> 35:58.655
You ready?

35:58.690 --> 35:59.556
Nope.

35:59.591 --> 36:01.224
Not unless you want
to take my place.

36:01.259 --> 36:02.259
Nope.

36:05.197 --> 36:10.366
Hi, I'm Elle, and I am gonna
teach you how to bake a pie.

36:10.402 --> 36:11.167
...No..

36:11.203 --> 36:12.502
That's a good first try.

36:12.537 --> 36:14.237
I'm Elle Bennett.

36:14.272 --> 36:16.406
You may have seen our ad,

36:16.441 --> 36:19.008
which looks suspiciously like...

36:19.044 --> 36:20.276
No, we're not gonna...

36:20.312 --> 36:21.411
Hey, gang?

36:21.446 --> 36:23.513
Who likes a good flaky crust?

36:24.850 --> 36:26.349
It's an option.

36:29.554 --> 36:30.720
Hi.

36:30.755 --> 36:31.988
I'm Elle.

36:32.023 --> 36:35.191
Look, you're seen a few ads for
cookware this Christmas season,

36:35.227 --> 36:39.429
with rich, delicious pie filling
bubbling over a flaky crust,

36:39.464 --> 36:41.364
cooling on the counter.

36:41.399 --> 36:42.532
Well, you're in for a treat,

36:42.567 --> 36:46.202
because I happen to know
the recipe for just that pie.

36:46.238 --> 36:50.406
So, we're gonna start with
three cups of all-purpose flour,

36:50.442 --> 36:51.641
and a quarter cup of sugar.

36:51.676 --> 36:55.245
You know, my friend Beth would
make this even in the dorms

36:55.280 --> 36:58.915
which is harder than it sounds.

36:58.950 --> 37:02.585
Now, some people say that
homemade is just too much work,

37:02.621 --> 37:06.256
but I say not only do you
appreciate it more,

37:06.291 --> 37:10.827
but it's like everyone else
can taste the effort.

37:14.866 --> 37:16.866
So, here's your personal
invitation

37:16.902 --> 37:20.236
to get in on our recipe circle.

37:20.272 --> 37:21.738
Share yours here.

37:21.773 --> 37:24.707
Thank you for coming
and helping with the edit.

37:24.743 --> 37:26.376
Well, there was free pie.

37:26.411 --> 37:29.312
Plus, your place is closer
than the office.

37:29.347 --> 37:31.014
Reminds me of when I worked
at a start-up,

37:31.049 --> 37:34.217
and there were a lot of late
nights at friends' apartments.

37:34.252 --> 37:36.986
Start-ups, huh?

37:37.022 --> 37:40.623
So, how did you end up working
at S&B?

37:40.659 --> 37:45.361
I guess I was looking for
something a little more steady?

37:45.397 --> 37:46.629
And it's fun?

37:46.665 --> 37:48.197
But...

37:52.003 --> 37:54.037
This turned out great.

37:54.072 --> 37:57.540
The, the video or the pie?

37:58.276 --> 38:00.443
Both.

38:00.478 --> 38:03.546
Ready to upload to the server
so Fiona can review it?

38:03.582 --> 38:06.182
Yes.

38:06.217 --> 38:12.155
I have to say, decorations-wise,
this is just the right amount.

38:12.190 --> 38:13.056
Except for that.

38:13.091 --> 38:15.191
That's maybe one decoration
too many.

38:16.528 --> 38:19.996
You know, it is scientifically
proven

38:20.031 --> 38:23.466
that Christmas decorations
make you happier.

38:25.637 --> 38:26.637
Oh yeah?

38:27.105 --> 38:28.738
Where was that study published?

38:28.773 --> 38:30.039
Lots of places.

38:30.075 --> 38:32.842
North Pole Journal.

38:32.877 --> 38:34.777
Elf Weekly.

38:34.813 --> 38:36.245
CNN.

38:38.650 --> 38:42.685
It really is everything but the
Christmas village on the mantle.

38:46.224 --> 38:49.459
It's not technically a mantle
for the Christmas village.

38:49.494 --> 38:54.230
Well, I ran out of space
so I had to improvise.

38:55.266 --> 38:57.333
These, these belonged
to my Grandmother.

38:57.369 --> 38:59.435
We used to always set it
up together.

38:59.471 --> 39:03.573
My dad used to decorate an
old sleigh in our driveway.

39:03.608 --> 39:07.944
My mom keeps up the tradition
every year.

39:07.979 --> 39:10.546
I wish she could see me.

39:10.582 --> 39:11.848
My grandma.

39:11.883 --> 39:14.617
She always worried, so it
would have been great

39:14.653 --> 39:17.153
if she could see me as
a grown-up

39:17.188 --> 39:22.558
with a good group of friends
around me, a good job.

39:22.594 --> 39:26.829
I actually just applied for
the creative director position.

39:26.865 --> 39:27.865
You did?

39:29.501 --> 39:32.001
Why? Is that a reach?

39:32.037 --> 39:36.639
No, I, no... I just didn't
realize they were...

39:38.309 --> 39:40.209
The video's uploaded.

39:40.245 --> 39:43.613
Okay, well, I guess we'll see
what Fiona thinks.

39:43.648 --> 39:46.416
Yeah, yeah, I should let you
get back to planning your party.

39:46.451 --> 39:49.886
Yeah, it's getting late.

39:49.921 --> 39:54.257
But I will see you tomorrow,
because, your mom invited me

39:54.292 --> 39:59.028
to come decorate the tree and
put up her social pages, so...

39:59.064 --> 40:00.496
What?

40:00.532 --> 40:01.397
No.

40:01.433 --> 40:04.500
Nothing...
Good job today.

40:04.536 --> 40:06.002
You too.

40:19.517 --> 40:20.517
Fiona, hi.

40:20.552 --> 40:22.051
The video looks great.

40:22.087 --> 40:23.820
You guys did a great job.

40:23.855 --> 40:25.822
Let's get this page up as soon
as we can

40:25.857 --> 40:27.690
and get people uploading theirs.

40:27.726 --> 40:28.391
You got it.

40:28.426 --> 40:29.659
I will get on that right now.

40:29.694 --> 40:31.127
<i>And, Elle.</i>

40:31.162 --> 40:32.729
I want to say I noticed.

40:32.764 --> 40:34.931
<i>I know collaborating with Max
was a challenge,</i>

40:34.966 --> 40:37.033
and it looks like you
figured it out.

40:37.068 --> 40:40.336
<i>I hope the fact that you're bot
in competition for the same job</i>

40:40.371 --> 40:43.072
won't change the work
you've been doing.

40:43.108 --> 40:45.708
What do you mean,
what competition?

40:45.744 --> 40:47.376
<i>Didn't you get my email?</i>

40:47.412 --> 40:50.947
Max applied for the creative
director position, too.

40:58.957 --> 41:01.858
Look at you, up and at 'em.

41:01.893 --> 41:04.193
Yeah, early bird gets

41:04.229 --> 41:08.197
the weird corporate stab
in the back, I guess.

41:08.233 --> 41:10.433
There you go.

41:10.468 --> 41:13.136
What do you mean?

41:13.171 --> 41:14.871
Just work stuff.

41:14.906 --> 41:18.474
Elle, I love you.
We are family.

41:18.510 --> 41:21.244
Should we just not do the party
this year?

41:21.279 --> 41:22.245
What?

41:22.280 --> 41:22.912
Are you...

41:22.947 --> 41:24.024
I know that it's important,

41:24.048 --> 41:27.550
but you are really busy,
and this job is big for you.

41:27.585 --> 41:29.752
We're here to support
you, I just think that...

41:29.788 --> 41:32.421
No, it is nothing
I can't handle.

41:32.457 --> 41:34.857
Okay, I admit, I am busier
than I thought I would be.

41:34.893 --> 41:41.764
But it turns out that Max
also applied for the same

41:41.800 --> 41:44.033
creative director position
I'm up for.

41:44.068 --> 41:46.135
Yeah, of course he did.
That's a great job.

41:46.171 --> 41:48.437
The position is here
in Chicago, though.

41:48.473 --> 41:49.572
He doesn't even live here.

41:49.607 --> 41:50.373
But look, I get it.

41:50.408 --> 41:52.041
People want to grow
at their jobs,

41:52.076 --> 41:52.909
it's just...

41:52.944 --> 41:55.912
Hun, it's not up to you
what people do.

41:55.947 --> 41:57.246
Is this a pep talk?

41:57.282 --> 42:00.249
No, you come to me
for the real talk.

42:03.555 --> 42:04.965
<i>So here is your personal
invitation</i>

42:04.989 --> 42:07.023
<i>to get in on our recipe circle.</i>

42:07.892 --> 42:08.724
Hey.

42:08.760 --> 42:13.529
Here. The numbers aren't great,
so far.

42:13.565 --> 42:15.965
You know, well, it takes time.

42:16.000 --> 42:16.933
They have to...

42:16.968 --> 42:21.037
I also wanted to talk to you
about something.

42:21.072 --> 42:23.873
Okay, so what's the next step?

42:23.908 --> 42:28.711
Well, we are in this phase
right here,

42:28.746 --> 42:31.414
where users are starting
to make their own videos.

42:31.449 --> 42:32.582
And how long does that take?

42:32.617 --> 42:35.184
According to the research,
it usually takes about a day

42:35.220 --> 42:36.719
to populate.

42:36.754 --> 42:40.056
This is the window
where we wait.

42:40.091 --> 42:42.892
It's in process. I swear.

42:42.927 --> 42:47.129
Okay, I trust you, but
the client is anxious.

42:47.165 --> 42:48.030
Foot on the gas, people.

42:48.066 --> 42:49.476
Max, can you help me
with some numbers?

42:49.500 --> 42:51.100
Sure thing.

42:51.135 --> 42:53.269
I wanted to tell you that
I also applied for the...

42:53.304 --> 42:54.570
I know.

42:54.606 --> 42:55.371
Max?

42:55.406 --> 43:00.009
Yep.

43:00.044 --> 43:01.177
Lunch today?

43:01.212 --> 43:01.878
What?

43:01.913 --> 43:02.778
Nothing.

43:02.814 --> 43:05.281
I'll just see you tonight
at my mom's.

43:05.316 --> 43:07.283
We can talk then.

43:07.318 --> 43:08.217
About that.

43:08.253 --> 43:14.357
I don't think it's such
a good idea.

43:14.392 --> 43:16.125
I see.

43:16.160 --> 43:19.395
Well, my mom was really looking
forward to having you over.

43:42.320 --> 43:44.053
Thanks.

43:46.557 --> 43:47.557
Hey.

43:48.559 --> 43:49.492
Hey.

43:49.527 --> 43:51.093
I'm glad you came.

43:51.129 --> 43:54.096
Well, people are finally
uploading their videos,

43:54.132 --> 43:56.632
so we have just enough
of a break.

43:56.668 --> 43:58.067
Well, come on up.
I'm almost done.

43:58.102 --> 44:00.303
Sure.

44:00.338 --> 44:03.472
Only if I can clear the air.

44:03.508 --> 44:08.344
We're both up for the same job,
and we'd both be great at it.

44:08.379 --> 44:10.212
Yeah, I should have said
something as soon as

44:10.248 --> 44:14.850
you'd mentioned you'd applied,
but the timing felt wrong.

44:14.886 --> 44:18.921
Thanks. I appreciate it.

44:18.957 --> 44:19.855
And, I get it.

44:19.891 --> 44:23.960
I mean, I just don't want it
to be...

44:31.069 --> 44:35.438
Did you put all of the lights
on the roof up by yourself?

44:35.473 --> 44:38.441
Well, my dad left the hooks up
all year.

44:39.344 --> 44:41.677
Makes it a lot easier.

44:41.713 --> 44:43.612
That's a good trick.

44:48.353 --> 44:50.786
You know, I can drop out of
the running if you want.

44:50.822 --> 44:52.054
What? Why?

44:52.090 --> 44:55.591
Max, no, that's ridiculous.

44:55.626 --> 44:58.260
No, if I get it...

44:58.296 --> 45:00.463
...You would be my boss.

45:00.498 --> 45:01.498
Yeah.

45:02.100 --> 45:04.333
And if you get it,
you'll be my boss.

45:04.369 --> 45:09.605
But what I was gonna say is,
you have a shot at it,

45:09.640 --> 45:10.973
and I know I have a shot at it,

45:11.009 --> 45:13.743
and I think we're both mature
enough to handle

45:13.778 --> 45:16.846
being candidates
at the same time.

45:16.881 --> 45:17.813
So, we just...

45:17.849 --> 45:20.349
The best person for the job
gets the job.

45:20.385 --> 45:24.220
That's just how it is.

45:24.255 --> 45:24.987
Okay.

45:25.023 --> 45:26.655
All right.

45:27.725 --> 45:29.203
It does feel good to get that
out in the open.

45:29.227 --> 45:30.159
Yeah.

45:30.194 --> 45:33.529
So. Cheers.

45:42.774 --> 45:48.010
My mom hangs mistletoe
right there every year.

45:48.813 --> 45:50.046
So I didn't realize we were...

45:50.081 --> 45:51.814
Oh, oh boy.

46:02.093 --> 46:03.459
Look at you two.

46:03.494 --> 46:04.827
Come in, come in and get warm.

46:04.862 --> 46:07.496
It's freezing out here.

46:07.532 --> 46:08.697
Hey.

46:10.768 --> 46:11.934
Hey.

46:11.969 --> 46:14.403
Jay, what are you...

46:14.439 --> 46:16.439
Hey, you made it!

46:21.712 --> 46:24.847
Well, the tree's not gonna
decorate itself.

46:26.584 --> 46:27.650
Great.

46:32.023 --> 46:33.589
I'm so glad you're all here.

46:33.624 --> 46:36.492
It's so much more fun
when there's more people.

46:36.527 --> 46:38.294
So, first question.

46:38.329 --> 46:39.795
Is the tree crooked?

46:39.831 --> 46:41.464
Mom, you always say that.

46:41.499 --> 46:42.531
No, it's really not.

46:42.567 --> 46:44.533
Well, it looks like
it's twisting to the right.

46:44.569 --> 46:46.235
Doesn't it?

46:46.270 --> 46:47.870
Elle?

46:47.905 --> 46:49.839
I think it's perfect.

46:50.908 --> 46:51.974
All right, then.

46:52.009 --> 46:55.277
Well, the lights are up,
here are the decorations,

46:55.313 --> 46:58.047
I'm gonna go finish my batch
of cider.

46:58.082 --> 47:01.417
And then, you and I have an
appointment with my computer.

47:08.092 --> 47:09.191
There.

47:09.227 --> 47:11.627
These are adorable.

47:11.662 --> 47:14.864
Yeah, yeah. Mom's an expert.

47:14.899 --> 47:16.031
What about this guy?

47:16.067 --> 47:18.367
That's third grade.
Don't judge.

47:18.402 --> 47:20.503
No, no.
I'm not judging.

47:20.538 --> 47:24.540
I have seen firsthand
your decoration making skills.

47:24.575 --> 47:26.108
That wreath was impressive.

47:26.144 --> 47:28.944
Well, it's not as good as yours.

47:31.883 --> 47:33.015
You hung my wreath.

47:33.050 --> 47:37.453
Yeah, you hung mine.
I thought it was nice.

47:37.488 --> 47:41.690
Oakley, how's the office
party planning coming along?

47:41.726 --> 47:43.359
Spectacular.

47:43.394 --> 47:45.895
The food, the wine,
the ice skating.

47:45.930 --> 47:47.463
That part I'm really proud of.

47:48.566 --> 47:49.810
It's actually gonna be a really
fun Friday night.

47:49.834 --> 47:51.901
I can't wait for you to see it.

47:51.936 --> 47:56.405
I... don't know if I'll be able
to make it, actually.

47:56.440 --> 48:00.042
Because we have our Misfit
Christmas party that night.

48:00.077 --> 48:03.379
I know I should try to make
both, but...

48:03.414 --> 48:07.616
it's just, this is something
I look forward to all year.

48:07.652 --> 48:10.653
It's the only time I get to see
the people that I'm closest to,

48:10.688 --> 48:14.256
and it kind of doesn't feel like
Christmas without it.

48:15.660 --> 48:18.727
Plus, it's the same day
as our interviews.

48:18.763 --> 48:21.297
I don't know about you, but
I'm going to be exhausted.

48:21.332 --> 48:23.065
What interview?

48:23.100 --> 48:26.635
Look, I didn't want to get
everyone's hopes up,

48:26.671 --> 48:27.671
especially not Mom's,

48:27.705 --> 48:31.941
but I applied for a creative
director job here.

48:31.976 --> 48:34.143
Wait, the same job
that Elle's up for?

48:34.178 --> 48:35.411
Yep. Yep.

48:35.446 --> 48:36.679
But we've already decided

48:36.714 --> 48:39.448
whoever is the best candidate
for the job...

48:39.483 --> 48:41.784
Wait, you applied
for a job here?

48:41.819 --> 48:42.751
Yeah.

48:42.787 --> 48:45.988
Max, that's awesome.

48:46.023 --> 48:48.624
Here's my famous iced cider.

48:48.659 --> 48:49.792
Oh, good.

48:49.827 --> 48:50.993
Spiced, or spiked?

48:51.028 --> 48:52.028
A little of both.

48:53.297 --> 48:54.263
All right.

48:54.298 --> 48:55.431
Well, cheers.

48:55.466 --> 48:57.666
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

49:02.139 --> 49:04.106
So, I post a picture here...

49:04.842 --> 49:05.741
Right?

49:05.776 --> 49:07.276
Yep.

49:07.311 --> 49:08.344
And share here?

49:09.547 --> 49:12.147
And then share here?

49:12.183 --> 49:15.117
I can't believe you made
this website so fast.

49:15.152 --> 49:16.619
You got it.

49:16.654 --> 49:17.720
It's that easy.

49:17.755 --> 49:21.724
Yeah, and the more you practice,
the easier it gets.

49:21.759 --> 49:22.858
<i>That was so simple.</i>

49:24.362 --> 49:27.096
But do not tell Max and Oakley
I said so.

49:27.131 --> 49:29.142
They've been trying to get me
to do this for a while.

49:29.166 --> 49:30.099
It's our secret.

49:30.134 --> 49:31.700
Mmkay.

49:31.736 --> 49:33.902
Why did you resist?

49:33.938 --> 49:40.442
Well, they had their father
convinced that we would expand.

49:40.478 --> 49:42.311
I made the ornaments,

49:42.346 --> 49:45.948
and he took care of everything
to do with the business.

49:45.983 --> 49:49.785
Well, it's obvious that you two
love doing this together.

49:49.820 --> 49:51.787
Yeah.

49:51.822 --> 49:54.923
When he passed, I was
so overwhelmed.

49:54.959 --> 50:00.162
Everything about the business
reminded me of him.

50:00.197 --> 50:04.833
But, the memory keeps
me hopeful.

50:04.869 --> 50:08.237
I used to look around at
my friends at Christmastime,

50:08.272 --> 50:11.106
and it made me...

50:11.142 --> 50:14.310
It made me miss my Grandma.

50:14.345 --> 50:16.845
She loved Christmas traditions,

50:16.881 --> 50:19.381
she loved the planning,
she loved the lists.

50:20.284 --> 50:22.985
And I was her little helper.

50:23.020 --> 50:25.387
Then I was her big helper.

50:25.423 --> 50:30.225
Until she... passed away
when I was in college.

50:30.261 --> 50:33.996
I'm sorry.

50:34.031 --> 50:39.401
Then I decided that I could keep
being sad,

50:39.437 --> 50:43.739
or I could make
my own Christmas.

50:43.774 --> 50:46.975
And then over time I realized
that traditions are really

50:47.011 --> 50:49.812
just honouring the love
and the effort

50:49.847 --> 50:51.980
that someone put in before you,

50:52.016 --> 50:55.117
and even if that person
who put in the effort

50:55.152 --> 50:57.086
isn't here anymore,

50:57.121 --> 51:00.689
we repeat traditions to keep
them a part of us.

51:00.725 --> 51:02.157
That's so true.

51:03.627 --> 51:05.527
Wait.

51:05.563 --> 51:07.262
Is this...

51:07.298 --> 51:10.866
That is your first online order.

51:10.901 --> 51:11.901
A sale?

51:14.171 --> 51:16.004
<i>We're heading out to the sleigh.</i>

51:16.040 --> 51:17.673
Family tradition.

51:17.708 --> 51:19.007
Grab your coat.

51:19.043 --> 51:23.379
Okay, just a little...
light here.

51:26.884 --> 51:30.052
Somehow this thing looks better
and better every year.

51:30.087 --> 51:33.088
I can't believe you guys
own your own sleigh.

51:34.825 --> 51:35.691
All right.

51:35.726 --> 51:37.860
I'm gonna get more
of the decorations.

51:37.895 --> 51:39.228
Oakley, you want to help me?

51:39.263 --> 51:39.962
Yeah.

51:39.997 --> 51:42.030
Jay? Why don't you lend
a hand?

51:44.268 --> 51:46.468
Thanks for helping Mom
with her website.

51:46.504 --> 51:48.370
Oh, it's no sweat.

51:48.406 --> 51:49.449
They're pretty easy to build.

51:49.473 --> 51:51.840
Yeah, but taking the time
to explain it to her,

51:51.876 --> 51:53.409
that's the important part.

51:53.444 --> 51:56.278
She's always been resistant
to asking for help.

51:57.114 --> 51:59.815
Yeah, I know somebody like that.

52:01.852 --> 52:05.220
Oh, it's Fiona.

52:05.256 --> 52:05.721
Ooh.

52:05.756 --> 52:07.423
She called me too.

52:07.458 --> 52:09.858
I must have had the ringer off.

52:09.894 --> 52:10.894
Fiona.

52:10.928 --> 52:11.860
Hi.

52:11.896 --> 52:13.729
Yeah, yeah, I can talk.

52:14.098 --> 52:17.433
Okay.

52:17.468 --> 52:19.735
Here we go.

52:19.770 --> 52:21.470
Good.

52:22.273 --> 52:26.475
There we go, perfect.

52:26.510 --> 52:27.687
The ladies from my
recipe circle,

52:27.711 --> 52:31.680
they come by and get their photo
in the sleigh every year.

52:31.715 --> 52:34.516
You have an actual
recipe circle?

52:34.552 --> 52:37.619
They don't just exchange
recipes, they teach.

52:37.655 --> 52:39.588
It's actually pretty amazing.

52:39.623 --> 52:43.258
Well, the rule is,
that you have to teach

52:43.294 --> 52:45.327
a traditional family recipe.

52:45.362 --> 52:47.463
There are so many
incredible recipes.

52:47.498 --> 52:50.032
It, looks like we're back
on duty.

52:50.067 --> 52:51.867
The client didn't like
the videos.

52:51.902 --> 52:55.604
Fiona's asking if we can
step it up.

52:55.639 --> 52:57.873
I think I know how.

52:57.908 --> 52:59.908
Okay, I've got you guys
framed up.

52:59.944 --> 53:00.642
Okay.

53:00.678 --> 53:01.443
You ready?

53:01.479 --> 53:02.177
Yes.

53:02.213 --> 53:02.611
Where do I look?
Where do I look?

53:02.646 --> 53:03.312
Where do I look?

53:03.347 --> 53:05.147
Just right into the camera, mom.

53:05.182 --> 53:06.114
Hey, everybody.

53:06.150 --> 53:08.116
My mom makes the best
green bean casserole

53:08.152 --> 53:09.918
you will ever have in your life.

53:09.954 --> 53:12.321
And now she's gonna show us
how she does it.

53:12.356 --> 53:17.726
Well, it's just green beans,
and my homemade soup mix...

53:17.761 --> 53:19.261
And a little fried onions.

53:19.296 --> 53:20.796
And fried onions.

53:20.831 --> 53:22.142
Well, why don't you get me
my apron?

53:22.166 --> 53:23.031
Yes.

53:23.067 --> 53:23.932
And we're going to need
a cutting board.

53:23.968 --> 53:24.733
Okay.

53:24.768 --> 53:25.100
So you can get
the cutting board.

53:25.135 --> 53:25.901
All right.

53:25.936 --> 53:26.502
Yep.

53:26.537 --> 53:27.302
There you are.

53:27.338 --> 53:28.237
That's perfect.

53:28.272 --> 53:28.737
Want me to tie it?

53:28.772 --> 53:29.805
Nope, that's okay.

53:53.697 --> 53:54.796
Looks good.

54:01.539 --> 54:02.704
Together?

54:04.909 --> 54:07.175
Yeah, so get your family
together and make something

54:07.211 --> 54:10.045
that reminds you of Christmas
at your home.

54:13.150 --> 54:16.552
Changing the videos to be about
traditional family recipes.

54:16.587 --> 54:18.554
I think we're onto
a solid thing here.

54:18.589 --> 54:20.856
Yeah. Me too.

54:20.891 --> 54:22.558
I'll see you tomorrow.

54:22.593 --> 54:24.860
Yeah, yeah.

54:24.895 --> 54:26.228
You want a ride?

54:26.263 --> 54:29.131
Depends how long it takes
your car to warm up.

54:29.166 --> 54:29.998
Takes a minute.

54:30.034 --> 54:32.267
Yeah, so?

54:42.379 --> 54:43.812
Okay, come on girl.

54:45.082 --> 54:46.882
Tell me I did okay?

54:46.917 --> 54:48.183
That wasn't weird?

54:48.218 --> 54:49.318
With Oakley?

54:49.353 --> 54:51.186
No, you were great.

54:51.221 --> 54:54.256
I'm very impressed.

54:54.291 --> 54:57.893
And, I think the mom likes you.

54:57.928 --> 55:02.297
The mom loves you.

55:02.333 --> 55:04.967
Okay, you better blast
that heat.

55:05.002 --> 55:06.468
Okay.

55:06.503 --> 55:09.571
There we go, there we go.

55:41.538 --> 55:43.905
Hey, you made it in!

55:43.941 --> 55:45.240
Look, Lucy.

55:45.275 --> 55:46.908
It's Auntie Elle.

55:48.045 --> 55:49.511
She's beautiful.

55:49.546 --> 55:50.445
Here.

55:50.481 --> 55:52.047
Hi.

55:52.082 --> 55:54.349
Hi, Lucy.

55:54.385 --> 55:56.418
It is so nice to meet you.

56:01.125 --> 56:04.726
The decorations look great,
Alexis.

56:04.762 --> 56:05.360
Oh, yeah.

56:05.396 --> 56:06.728
I'm sorry I couldn't help.

56:06.764 --> 56:08.463
It was so fun.

56:08.499 --> 56:10.232
Kate and Jason got in
last night,

56:10.267 --> 56:12.701
and we had eggnog,

56:12.736 --> 56:16.872
I saved you your stocking.

56:19.343 --> 56:20.742
You wanna go back to momma?

56:20.778 --> 56:23.979
Okay.

56:24.014 --> 56:25.447
There you go.

56:25.716 --> 56:27.816
<i>She's so cute!</i>

56:35.092 --> 56:35.991
Nice.

56:36.026 --> 56:38.193
See, you didn't miss anything.

56:38.228 --> 56:40.762
They've been telling us how busy
your work is keeping you.

56:40.798 --> 56:42.342
Still gonna make a pie
with Ryan though,

56:42.366 --> 56:44.399
I am coming home
right after work.

56:44.435 --> 56:49.671
Elle, we were planning
on going carolling tonight.

56:49.707 --> 56:52.307
I'm so sorry that all of
this stuff got in the way

56:52.342 --> 56:53.308
of all this planning.

56:53.343 --> 56:56.378
Don't apologize, we get it.

56:56.413 --> 56:57.646
Okay.

56:57.681 --> 57:00.182
Well, you all have a great day,

57:00.217 --> 57:05.921
Jay and I are gonna go to work,
and I'll see you soon.

57:05.956 --> 57:07.122
I'll see you soon.

57:19.470 --> 57:20.936
Hey, check it out.

57:24.975 --> 57:27.008
Max, are these numbers real?

57:27.044 --> 57:28.944
Not only did people start
posting five times

57:28.979 --> 57:32.013
as many videos, but
they're converting to sales.

57:37.254 --> 57:38.754
We've increased the videos by...

57:47.564 --> 57:49.131
Congratulations.

57:49.166 --> 57:50.932
You too.

57:53.470 --> 57:57.572
Well, I guess we just have
our interview presentations

57:57.608 --> 57:59.841
to work on now, then.

57:59.877 --> 58:02.911
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

58:02.946 --> 58:04.713
Good job.

58:16.093 --> 58:16.925
Hey.

58:16.960 --> 58:18.593
I'm gonna go meet the gang
for lunch.

58:18.629 --> 58:20.328
And then ice skating.

58:20.364 --> 58:21.863
You sure you can't get away?

58:21.899 --> 58:23.298
I wish.

58:23.333 --> 58:26.568
I'm trying to back up all
my ideas with numbers, and...

58:26.603 --> 58:29.204
I know you want this job,
I know it's important to you,

58:29.239 --> 58:30.338
but eat!

58:30.374 --> 58:33.842
I just have to get this done,
so I can go carolling

58:33.877 --> 58:38.647
and make a pie, and then finish
this presentation.

58:38.682 --> 58:40.682
I've already missed so many
other things.

58:40.717 --> 58:42.617
At least grab a sandwich.

58:42.653 --> 58:45.053
I'll bring one back for you.

58:45.088 --> 58:48.623
Look, I promise I will step out
for a few minutes and grab one.

58:50.093 --> 58:52.594
All right. See you.

59:19.122 --> 59:21.389
Did you skate growing up?

59:21.425 --> 59:23.124
Not really.

59:23.160 --> 59:27.729
A few years ago,
Jay and I took a lesson.

59:27.764 --> 59:30.198
It was fun.

59:30.234 --> 59:32.334
I've been meaning to ask.

59:32.369 --> 59:33.768
Your friend Jay...

59:33.804 --> 59:37.239
Is totally into your sister,
yes.

59:37.274 --> 59:38.518
That's not what I was going
to ask.

59:38.542 --> 59:42.277
Wait. So you and Jay
are not...

59:42.312 --> 59:43.845
No!

59:43.881 --> 59:47.682
Did... does it seem like we are?

59:47.718 --> 59:49.117
Actually...

59:49.152 --> 59:51.586
No, we're not.

59:51.622 --> 59:55.290
Jay and I know both very clearly
that we're not.

59:55.325 --> 59:58.827
So last night in Jay's car
when you were...

59:58.862 --> 01:00:01.563
You left your scarf, and when
I came back out with it

01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:03.899
from where I was standing,
it looked...

01:00:09.573 --> 01:00:14.843
How would you feel about
being wrong on that?

01:00:14.878 --> 01:00:20.782
I would feel relieved.

01:00:20.817 --> 01:00:26.488
Do you want to skate?
Just for like 10 minutes?

01:00:26.523 --> 01:00:29.424
Okay. But only for 10 minutes,

01:00:29.459 --> 01:00:32.193
and only if I can think about
work the whole time.

01:00:32.229 --> 01:00:33.929
Deal.

01:00:33.964 --> 01:00:36.698
My presentation's the same one
I always do in interviews.

01:00:36.733 --> 01:00:38.433
So you interview a lot?

01:00:38.468 --> 01:00:40.235
I like to see what's out there,
yeah.

01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:43.805
I want this job because
it's close to my mom,

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:46.908
but every once in a while
something comes along

01:00:46.944 --> 01:00:50.211
that feels a little bit more
like me.

01:00:50.247 --> 01:00:53.515
I can get the opportunity
to build something.

01:00:53.550 --> 01:00:54.916
Plus, you have to be
a real shark

01:00:54.952 --> 01:00:57.285
to work at a company like that.

01:00:57.321 --> 01:01:00.488
So you like the idea of working
at a smaller company, huh?

01:01:00.524 --> 01:01:01.957
Yeah.

01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:03.158
What about you?

01:01:03.193 --> 01:01:04.292
What's your presentation?

01:01:04.328 --> 01:01:07.662
How does Elle Bennett
sell herself?

01:01:07.698 --> 01:01:12.400
Well, my grandma raised me
on a tight budget,

01:01:12.436 --> 01:01:17.205
and I like that we help people
make informed decisions

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:18.373
about what they buy.

01:01:18.408 --> 01:01:22.644
The internet is great, but we
could do that in person.

01:01:22.679 --> 01:01:23.845
You know?

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:26.915
We could do demos for cookware
in stores and at the mall.

01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:28.149
And then it goes beyond that.

01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:31.886
If we're selling cars, we could
do pop-up test drive events.

01:01:31.922 --> 01:01:34.155
We should focus
on helping people

01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:37.125
try these products out
before they buy.

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:38.171
Well, those are great ideas.

01:01:38.195 --> 01:01:41.196
Are you going to pitch those
in your interview?

01:01:41.231 --> 01:01:43.398
No.

01:01:43.433 --> 01:01:45.200
One thing at a time.

01:01:45.235 --> 01:01:48.770
If I get the job, then
I will make it happen,

01:01:48.805 --> 01:01:53.942
but for now, I'll just focus on
showing them what I'm best at.

01:01:57.481 --> 01:02:00.482
I'm sorry that I made an
assumption about you and Jay.

01:02:00.517 --> 01:02:03.184
Especially since I was
so clearly into coffee guy

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:04.719
at the time.

01:02:07.157 --> 01:02:11.559
I probably shouldn't
have said that.

01:02:11.595 --> 01:02:14.429
Since we work together.

01:02:14.464 --> 01:02:15.263
No.

01:02:15.298 --> 01:02:17.565
Coffee guy is happy
that you did.

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:22.804
Elle!

01:02:23.907 --> 01:02:26.608
Hey Elle!

01:02:26.643 --> 01:02:28.543
Hey guys.

01:02:30.213 --> 01:02:33.515
I was just...

01:02:33.550 --> 01:02:35.850
This isn't...

01:02:35.886 --> 01:02:37.452
How was lunch?

01:02:37.487 --> 01:02:39.821
Deep dish pizza's not the same
anywhere else.

01:02:39.856 --> 01:02:42.657
And we got those amazing
mint hot chocolates.

01:02:42.692 --> 01:02:44.626
My folks took Lucy for a nap.

01:02:44.661 --> 01:02:49.431
I was working and then
I got hungry, and...

01:02:49.466 --> 01:02:50.832
This is Max.

01:02:50.867 --> 01:02:51.766
Nice to meet you.

01:02:51.802 --> 01:02:52.834
Hi.

01:02:52.869 --> 01:02:54.714
Can you join us for a quick
skate around the rink?

01:02:54.738 --> 01:03:00.642
Actually, I should head
back to work on my presentation.

01:03:00.677 --> 01:03:02.577
Well, we're going
carolling tonight,

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:04.079
if you can take a break.

01:03:04.114 --> 01:03:05.346
Max, you should come too.

01:03:05.382 --> 01:03:07.115
I don't want
to intrude on your...

01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:07.949
No, no not at all.

01:03:07.984 --> 01:03:10.785
We'd let your family
come meet ours.

01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:12.420
If you don't want to...

01:03:12.456 --> 01:03:13.822
Come on, let the man
come and learn

01:03:13.857 --> 01:03:16.191
how truly bad we are
at harmonizing.

01:03:18.195 --> 01:03:20.795
Gosh, I don't even know
if I can come.

01:03:20.831 --> 01:03:29.204
But maybe I can,
I will figure it out.

01:03:29.239 --> 01:03:30.338
Yes, yes.

01:03:30.373 --> 01:03:31.139
I'm in!

01:03:31.174 --> 01:03:33.141
Yeah, we'll go
carolling tonight.

01:03:33.176 --> 01:03:34.176
Perfect.

01:03:34.945 --> 01:03:35.610
All right.

01:03:35.645 --> 01:03:36.277
Okay.

01:03:36.313 --> 01:03:37.545
See you tonight.

01:03:37.581 --> 01:03:39.347
Last one around the track
changes diapers.

01:03:40.951 --> 01:03:41.516
That's you.

01:03:41.551 --> 01:03:42.383
That's on you.

01:03:42.419 --> 01:03:44.052
Not here...

01:03:44.087 --> 01:03:47.422
Listen, Elle. Carolling sounds
fun, but if you need to...

01:03:47.457 --> 01:03:54.062
No, please come. I'll...
I'll make it work.

01:03:54.097 --> 01:03:55.563
Okay.

01:04:11.781 --> 01:04:14.983
All right people, let's go
spread some Christmas cheer.

01:04:16.219 --> 01:04:17.519
<i>Christmas cheer!</i>

01:04:18.855 --> 01:04:20.922
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:04:20.957 --> 01:04:22.157
Thanks for coming.

01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:22.724
Oh, yeah.

01:04:22.759 --> 01:04:23.725
Your friends are fun.

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.960
They told me a lot of great
stories already.

01:04:28.231 --> 01:04:30.431
You should come to our party
tomorrow night.

01:04:30.467 --> 01:04:33.368
The party games are epic.

01:04:33.403 --> 01:04:36.971
Thank you, but I'm gonna go
to the office party.

01:04:37.007 --> 01:04:38.339
My sister organized it,

01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:39.886
the partners themselves
are gonna be there,

01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:41.342
they're flying in from New York.

01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:43.211
They're the ones doing
the interviews.

01:04:43.246 --> 01:04:45.513
Right. I know that part.

01:04:45.549 --> 01:04:46.614
Yeah.

01:04:46.650 --> 01:04:49.317
Yeah.
Maybe I should.

01:04:58.762 --> 01:05:00.795
Guess we'll have to make
the pie later, huh?

01:05:00.830 --> 01:05:04.699
I meant to tell you,
I already made the pie.

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:05.433
You did?

01:05:05.468 --> 01:05:07.069
Yeah.
This afternoon.

01:05:09.039 --> 01:05:09.971
You okay?

01:05:10.006 --> 01:05:12.473
Of course.
Yeah.

01:05:12.509 --> 01:05:15.510
Looks like everything for
the party's coming together.

01:06:09.132 --> 01:06:10.732
Okay.

01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:33.154
Oh, no!

01:06:33.189 --> 01:06:36.124
Oh, no, no, no!

01:06:36.159 --> 01:06:37.725
Okay.

01:07:06.656 --> 01:07:08.156
Is that Elle?

01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:25.540
Okay.

01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:28.876
Oh, wait.

01:07:35.318 --> 01:07:36.050
Hi.

01:07:36.086 --> 01:07:37.952
Hey.

01:07:38.788 --> 01:07:40.588
What time's your interview?

01:07:40.623 --> 01:07:42.390
Four o'clock.

01:07:42.425 --> 01:07:43.191
Yours?

01:07:43.226 --> 01:07:44.226
Two o'clock.

01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:49.163
You nervous?

01:07:49.199 --> 01:07:51.566
Not really.

01:07:51.601 --> 01:07:52.601
...A little.

01:07:54.437 --> 01:07:55.903
You?

01:07:55.939 --> 01:07:57.872
Nope.

01:07:57.907 --> 01:07:59.307
Yes.

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:02.343
No.

01:08:11.254 --> 01:08:13.087
Well, then.

01:08:13.123 --> 01:08:14.922
Good luck today.

01:08:14.958 --> 01:08:16.624
You too.

01:08:16.658 --> 01:08:18.158
Whatever happens.

01:08:18.194 --> 01:08:19.926
Best person for the job.

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:26.667
Missed your coffee this morning.

01:08:26.703 --> 01:08:29.504
I was running late.

01:08:29.538 --> 01:08:31.238
You sure that's it?

01:08:31.274 --> 01:08:33.314
I know that you've missed out
on a few of the things

01:08:33.343 --> 01:08:34.876
you love about this party.

01:08:34.911 --> 01:08:37.845
I'm just excited
that it's happening.

01:08:37.881 --> 01:08:40.648
Once I get there, I'll...

01:08:40.683 --> 01:08:42.917
Once you get there, you'll...?

01:08:42.952 --> 01:08:45.252
I'll be fine.

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:47.654
I'm excited, that's all.

01:08:48.558 --> 01:08:50.224
It's gonna be tough to get there
by 6:00.

01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:53.127
Elle? Just a head's up, we're
running pretty far behind.

01:08:53.162 --> 01:08:55.897
It'll be closer to 5:00
before we get you in.

01:08:55.932 --> 01:08:58.433
Great, no problem.

01:09:01.069 --> 01:09:02.502
Hey.

01:09:02.538 --> 01:09:04.104
Good luck in there.

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:06.541
All you have to do is show them
all the best things

01:09:06.576 --> 01:09:08.975
about my best friend.

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:45.313
<i>I question whether calling
something a social media event</i>

01:09:45.348 --> 01:09:47.415
<i>even means anything.</i>

01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:49.015
<i>The internet only feels real.</i>

01:09:49.051 --> 01:09:52.220
<i>The idea is to create
real life events.</i>

01:09:52.255 --> 01:09:54.522
<i>People talk about organic food,
organic materials.</i>

01:09:54.557 --> 01:09:57.792
<i>This is organic marketing.</i>

01:09:57.827 --> 01:10:00.528
Cooking demos for cookware.

01:10:00.563 --> 01:10:02.930
Test drive events,
not at the dealership,

01:10:02.966 --> 01:10:04.832
<i>but places people actually go.</i>

01:10:04.868 --> 01:10:08.436
Get people to use the products
before they buy them.

01:10:16.346 --> 01:10:17.478
Elle?

01:10:18.448 --> 01:10:20.047
Elle?

01:10:44.574 --> 01:10:45.206
Hey.

01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:46.173
There you are.

01:10:46.209 --> 01:10:47.542
I couldn't find you.

01:10:47.577 --> 01:10:49.877
Because I...

01:10:49.913 --> 01:10:52.713
I heard what you told Fiona
and the board.

01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:55.883
Yes. Look, I'm sorry if I
overstepped boundaries,

01:10:55.919 --> 01:11:00.521
but it just seemed
like the right decision.

01:11:00.557 --> 01:11:03.190
The right decision.

01:11:03.226 --> 01:11:06.294
To steal my ideas?

01:11:06.329 --> 01:11:09.330
Wait, what are
you talking about?

01:11:09.365 --> 01:11:11.999
The cooking demos and
the pop-up test drives,

01:11:12.035 --> 01:11:15.036
and everything that we talked
about yesterday.

01:11:15.071 --> 01:11:17.838
You stole those?

01:11:17.874 --> 01:11:19.707
Stole?

01:11:19.742 --> 01:11:21.642
Is that really who you think
I am?

01:11:21.678 --> 01:11:26.847
I didn't, until I heard it.

01:11:26.883 --> 01:11:28.983
I guess I should have known.

01:11:29.018 --> 01:11:33.454
You have to be a real shark.

01:11:33.489 --> 01:11:35.456
Your words, I mean,
you said that.

01:11:35.491 --> 01:11:37.725
And now you're throwing
that back in my face

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:40.995
to accuse me of...

01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:43.764
That's...

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:46.033
I guess adorable meetings
in coffee shops

01:11:46.069 --> 01:11:48.669
are exactly how they feel.

01:11:48.705 --> 01:11:52.873
Yeah. Too good to be true.

01:12:05.288 --> 01:12:06.921
I can't believe it.

01:12:06.956 --> 01:12:09.090
I was just starting to
like the guy, too.

01:12:09.125 --> 01:12:10.235
He's funny and charming, and...

01:12:10.259 --> 01:12:13.661
He said it himself, though.

01:12:13.696 --> 01:12:15.730
Should have seen it coming.

01:12:15.765 --> 01:12:18.966
People tell you who they are.

01:12:19.002 --> 01:12:20.935
Sorry we're running late.

01:12:20.970 --> 01:12:22.470
Please come in.

01:12:27.243 --> 01:12:30.177
Party starts in ten minutes.

01:12:30.213 --> 01:12:31.345
Go.

01:12:31.381 --> 01:12:32.279
You'll be late as it is.

01:12:32.315 --> 01:12:34.615
No, I don't want to go
without you, Elle.

01:12:34.651 --> 01:12:37.218
I'll just, I'll wait here
with you and then...

01:12:37.253 --> 01:12:39.086
No.

01:12:39.122 --> 01:12:43.758
Look, you all did such a great
job pulling it together.

01:12:43.793 --> 01:12:47.662
I... I'm gonna miss most of it,

01:12:47.697 --> 01:12:53.000
but at least I know it happened
and everyone had fun.

01:12:53.036 --> 01:12:56.203
You shouldn't miss it too.

01:12:56.239 --> 01:12:58.406
Go.

01:12:58.441 --> 01:13:00.641
Make my apologies.

01:13:00.677 --> 01:13:03.310
Merry Christmas, Elle.

01:13:03.346 --> 01:13:05.479
Merry Christmas, Jay.

01:13:07.684 --> 01:13:09.183
All right.

01:13:45.788 --> 01:13:48.789
Again, I'm so sorry
we're so behind.

01:13:48.825 --> 01:13:49.957
Last two.

01:13:49.992 --> 01:13:52.760
You are next.

01:13:52.795 --> 01:13:54.795
So sorry that this
is running late.

01:13:54.831 --> 01:13:55.629
The good news is,

01:13:55.665 --> 01:13:56.630
we can all walk over
to the company

01:13:56.666 --> 01:13:58.466
Christmas party together.

01:13:58.501 --> 01:14:01.869
At least I'll make
one party today.

01:14:01.904 --> 01:14:06.040
Your ideas have already made
an impression in there.

01:14:06.075 --> 01:14:08.442
My ideas?

01:14:08.478 --> 01:14:11.846
Max Turner walked in there,
started his presentation,

01:14:11.881 --> 01:14:13.948
<i>and then spent most
of the time telling us</i>

01:14:13.983 --> 01:14:15.750
<i>you were great.</i>

01:14:18.154 --> 01:14:19.353
He did?

01:14:19.388 --> 01:14:20.921
He said you had ideas
he was afraid

01:14:20.957 --> 01:14:22.757
you wouldn't get a chance
to share.

01:14:22.792 --> 01:14:24.992
And he wanted to make sure
we knew.

01:14:25.027 --> 01:14:27.061
But, why would he?

01:14:27.096 --> 01:14:29.130
Because he stepped out
of the running.

01:14:29.165 --> 01:14:31.198
He actually resigned
the company,

01:14:31.234 --> 01:14:34.001
said he's going to another
opportunity.

01:14:35.371 --> 01:14:37.238
See you in a bit.

01:14:46.849 --> 01:14:47.748
And at the end of the day,

01:14:47.784 --> 01:14:50.451
if a consumer can interact
with a product

01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:52.119
and make an informed choice,

01:14:52.155 --> 01:14:55.122
our clients will see that
translate into sales,

01:14:55.158 --> 01:14:58.125
and that's across
all of our brands.

01:14:58.161 --> 01:14:59.760
Very impressive, Miss Bennett.

01:14:59.796 --> 01:15:00.939
You not only have
very good ideas,

01:15:00.963 --> 01:15:04.565
but you back them up with
figures and secondary plans.

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:06.333
That's good marketing.

01:15:06.369 --> 01:15:09.136
Best of all, you're thinking
outside of just cookware.

01:15:09.172 --> 01:15:12.206
These ideas work across
all of our divisions.

01:15:12.241 --> 01:15:15.009
One last question, Miss Bennett.

01:15:15.044 --> 01:15:18.279
Why do you think you should be
one of our creative directors?

01:15:18.314 --> 01:15:23.484
Well, my record has some
impressive numbers.

01:15:30.827 --> 01:15:32.993
One of the ways
that I think I...

01:15:36.766 --> 01:15:42.603
Honestly, because while I take
this very seriously,

01:15:42.638 --> 01:15:45.840
I'd rather we were all at
a Christmas Party right now.

01:15:45.875 --> 01:15:47.575
I beg your pardon?

01:15:47.610 --> 01:15:52.947
Every year, we all gather around
friends and family

01:15:52.982 --> 01:15:55.316
for Christmas, right?

01:15:55.351 --> 01:15:58.986
How do you plan them,
in your life?

01:15:59.021 --> 01:16:00.487
Your home?

01:16:00.523 --> 01:16:01.989
Who does that work?

01:16:02.024 --> 01:16:07.094
Well, actually, I have a sister
who cooks a lot,

01:16:07.129 --> 01:16:10.698
and my son is always a big help.

01:16:10.733 --> 01:16:14.535
And which part to you is better?

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:20.374
The party or setting it up
with your sister and son?

01:16:20.409 --> 01:16:23.210
Actually, both now that
I think of it.

01:16:23.246 --> 01:16:26.080
Exactly.

01:16:26.115 --> 01:16:28.682
You see, every year,

01:16:28.718 --> 01:16:34.188
I have this little group of
wonderful humans, and we...

01:16:34.223 --> 01:16:39.293
Well, I set up the decorations
with Alexis.

01:16:39.328 --> 01:16:42.296
My friend Jay and I go shopping
for gifts because...

01:16:42.331 --> 01:16:46.066
well, because he's hopeless
at it.

01:16:46.102 --> 01:16:48.969
My friend Ryan and I,
we make a pie.

01:16:49.005 --> 01:16:51.839
The recipe for which we have
been perfecting since college,

01:16:51.874 --> 01:16:54.408
but he doesn't know that we've
been perfecting the recipe,

01:16:54.443 --> 01:16:58.312
he just... likes being there.

01:16:58.347 --> 01:17:01.682
And yes, I love the process
of setting it up,

01:17:01.717 --> 01:17:03.918
just as much as I love
the party.

01:17:03.953 --> 01:17:09.623
But this year, I didn't get
to do a lot of it.

01:17:09.659 --> 01:17:13.727
And I realized that I didn't
so much miss doing the things

01:17:13.763 --> 01:17:15.562
as much as I missed...

01:17:15.598 --> 01:17:16.931
The people.

01:17:16.966 --> 01:17:19.833
Exactly.

01:17:19.869 --> 01:17:23.504
And it's the same for getting
through the workday.

01:17:23.539 --> 01:17:24.672
Planning a party.

01:17:24.707 --> 01:17:27.908
Making something you love.

01:17:27.944 --> 01:17:32.880
Falling in love.

01:17:32.915 --> 01:17:36.884
Or, any kind of campaign.

01:17:36.919 --> 01:17:37.919
Yes.

01:17:37.954 --> 01:17:39.954
We take all of the pieces
and we make the effort

01:17:39.989 --> 01:17:41.221
to put it together.

01:17:41.257 --> 01:17:42.790
But none of it means anything

01:17:42.825 --> 01:17:46.760
if you're not doing
it for people.

01:17:46.796 --> 01:17:49.964
That's why me.

01:17:49.999 --> 01:17:51.665
Now, if you'll excuse me,

01:17:51.701 --> 01:17:54.535
I have somewhere that I have
to try to get to,

01:17:54.570 --> 01:17:56.670
if you wouldn't mind.

01:17:56.706 --> 01:17:59.974
Your honesty is refreshing.

01:18:00.009 --> 01:18:02.042
Good luck to you, Miss Bennett.

01:18:02.078 --> 01:18:03.911
Thank you.

01:18:05.548 --> 01:18:07.715
Jay, I don't know why
you're not answering,

01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:12.119
but I'm on my way, I just...

01:18:12.154 --> 01:18:17.658
I just have to stop and
straighten things out with...

01:18:17.693 --> 01:18:19.727
Max.

01:18:21.864 --> 01:18:23.964
How'd you do in there?

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.602
Pretty well I think.

01:18:28.637 --> 01:18:31.505
I don't know, it's always hard
to tell with those things.

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:34.274
Yeah.

01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:36.310
Look, Max.

01:18:36.345 --> 01:18:38.145
I overreacted.

01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:45.152
I was angry and confused
because it didn't seem like you.

01:18:45.187 --> 01:18:46.820
I jumped to a conclusion.

01:18:46.856 --> 01:18:50.257
Just like I did when I thought
that you and Jay were...

01:18:50.292 --> 01:18:55.629
Except you gave me the space
to tell you the truth.

01:18:55.664 --> 01:18:59.233
I didn't return that kindness.

01:18:59.268 --> 01:19:00.634
I'm sorry.

01:19:00.669 --> 01:19:03.704
I'm sorry I didn't explain
or ask your permission

01:19:03.739 --> 01:19:05.406
to go in there and pitch
your ideas.

01:19:05.441 --> 01:19:09.410
I just wanted them to know that
you were perfect for the...

01:19:10.946 --> 01:19:14.148
No, just perfect.

01:19:14.183 --> 01:19:17.985
End of sentence.

01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:21.288
Look, we're both...

01:19:21.323 --> 01:19:22.523
Pretty tired?

01:19:24.393 --> 01:19:25.492
Yeah.

01:19:25.528 --> 01:19:27.361
Yeah. Let's get you
to your Christmas party

01:19:27.396 --> 01:19:28.829
with your friends.

01:19:30.766 --> 01:19:33.233
Oh wait.

01:19:33.269 --> 01:19:35.002
It's this way.

01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:38.772
Yeah.

01:19:38.808 --> 01:19:39.840
Come on.

01:19:46.982 --> 01:19:49.316
Great! You made it,
both of you.

01:19:49.351 --> 01:19:50.584
About time.

01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:52.586
This way, please.

01:19:52.621 --> 01:19:54.555
I don't understand.

01:19:56.325 --> 01:19:59.660
Well, I had to get you here
to the party somehow.

01:19:59.695 --> 01:20:01.462
Turns out when I signed
for the place,

01:20:01.497 --> 01:20:07.000
I got the atrium space even
though we didn't need it.

01:20:07.036 --> 01:20:09.236
Excuse me.

01:20:09.271 --> 01:20:13.207
When Max told me about the
interviews running long...

01:20:13.242 --> 01:20:15.175
You did this?

01:20:20.282 --> 01:20:21.181
Merry Christmas, Elle.

01:20:21.217 --> 01:20:22.683
Merry Christmas.

01:20:22.718 --> 01:20:24.585
Wait, what is happening?

01:20:26.021 --> 01:20:27.799
Well, we started the party
in the coffee shop,

01:20:27.823 --> 01:20:30.290
but then Jay said you weren't
going to make it in time.

01:20:30.326 --> 01:20:32.960
And so, we asked ourselves
what you'd do,

01:20:32.995 --> 01:20:35.429
and Jay talked to Oakley...

01:20:35.464 --> 01:20:36.930
And I called...

01:20:36.966 --> 01:20:39.533
Me.

01:20:39.568 --> 01:20:41.101
Your friends are great.

01:20:41.137 --> 01:20:43.604
Yeah. They are.

01:20:43.639 --> 01:20:45.105
Yeah, we're pretty good.

01:20:46.542 --> 01:20:48.909
Oh, Nancy.

01:20:48.944 --> 01:20:52.513
I wouldn't have missed it, and
I'm so glad things worked out.

01:20:52.548 --> 01:20:54.314
Thank you.

01:20:56.118 --> 01:20:58.519
Guys!

01:20:58.554 --> 01:20:59.520
If it was any one of us,

01:20:59.555 --> 01:21:02.055
you would have made sure
the party came to us.

01:21:02.091 --> 01:21:05.092
I don't know what to say.

01:21:07.596 --> 01:21:08.996
Thank you.

01:21:09.031 --> 01:21:11.331
Thanks all of you.

01:21:11.367 --> 01:21:16.637
This is the best Misfit
Christmas surprise ever.

01:21:16.672 --> 01:21:21.108
Wait, I don't think we can call
it Misfit Christmas anymore.

01:21:21.143 --> 01:21:22.843
Almost Family Christmas?

01:21:22.878 --> 01:21:24.778
Or Found Family Christmas?

01:21:24.813 --> 01:21:28.649
How about just Family Christmas?

01:21:31.554 --> 01:21:34.488
Well, come on.
There's tons of food, let's eat.

01:21:34.523 --> 01:21:35.589
There's a whole pie here!

01:21:35.624 --> 01:21:37.224
<i>Oh yeah!</i>

01:21:39.562 --> 01:21:40.627
I have to hand it to you.

01:21:40.663 --> 01:21:41.828
You pulled off a good...

01:21:41.864 --> 01:21:43.130
Networking event?

01:21:43.165 --> 01:21:44.932
A good Christmas party.

01:21:44.967 --> 01:21:46.411
Just wait until you see
the party I throw

01:21:46.435 --> 01:21:48.235
when you launch
your new company.

01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:50.737
Well, it's not my company,
it's Mom's company.

01:21:50.773 --> 01:21:52.339
I'm just gonna turn it
into the biggest

01:21:52.374 --> 01:21:54.641
family-run decoration
company yet.

01:21:54.677 --> 01:21:56.476
Here's hoping.

01:21:56.512 --> 01:21:58.478
It's what Dad would have wanted.

01:22:01.650 --> 01:22:04.851
Do you mind if I get your
thoughts on a few things?

01:22:04.887 --> 01:22:06.587
Sure.

01:22:20.236 --> 01:22:23.103
You're really leaving
the company?

01:22:23.138 --> 01:22:27.574
Let's just say I found a better
opportunity to do what I love.

01:22:29.144 --> 01:22:30.377
If we don't work together,

01:22:30.412 --> 01:22:35.215
then we could go back to being
those people in the coffee shop.

01:22:35.251 --> 01:22:38.151
We definitely should.

01:22:38.187 --> 01:22:42.470
So, now that work's done...

01:22:44.296 --> 01:22:46.754
...and the party is happening...

01:22:47.768 --> 01:22:51.961
...I can just...
relax into Christmas?

01:22:52.034 --> 01:22:53.434
With me.

01:22:53.702 --> 01:22:55.014
Yeah.

01:22:56.639 --> 01:22:57.940
With you.

01:22:58.305 --> 01:23:04.173
