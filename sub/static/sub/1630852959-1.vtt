00:02.219 --> 00:04.352
47% of
Americans eat one every day

00:06.919 --> 00:09.009
and over 100 billion each year.

00:10.706 --> 00:13.317
Whether you call it a
sub, a hoagie, or a hero,

00:13.361 --> 00:15.624
it's an American staple.

00:15.667 --> 00:17.017
Who doesn't love a sandwich?

00:18.583 --> 00:21.543
Sandwich shops
are a $25 billion business.

00:23.110 --> 00:27.897
But back in 1960, sub sandwiches
are a niche Italian food.

00:29.203 --> 00:31.683
In the sixties, the
sandwich was two pieces

00:31.727 --> 00:33.033
of white wonder bread.

00:34.730 --> 00:38.516
Until two pairs
of upstarts enter a race

00:38.560 --> 00:41.389
to change the way America eats.

00:41.432 --> 00:45.523
He really brought the
idea of the sub to America.

00:45.567 --> 00:47.221
Nobody does what Subway does.

00:49.136 --> 00:52.095
And flip
the script on fast food.

00:52.139 --> 00:54.141
Salad on a sandwich,
that's our specialty.

00:54.184 --> 00:56.752
Subway was the
first fast food chain

00:56.795 --> 00:59.798
to allow you to customize
to the extent that it does.

00:59.842 --> 01:02.062
Giving rise to
the largest restaurant chain

01:02.105 --> 01:03.759
on the planet.

01:03.802 --> 01:06.327
We have a limited window
of opportunity here.

01:06.370 --> 01:08.851
And
turning a humble food

01:08.894 --> 01:10.244
into an American icon.

01:12.202 --> 01:14.944
This is "Submarine Warfare."

01:41.188 --> 01:44.756
In the mid 1960s, fast
food in America is emerging

01:44.800 --> 01:47.455
as a prosperous industry
for the first time.

01:48.760 --> 01:50.501
What started in
Southern California

01:50.545 --> 01:55.245
with the McDonald's brothers,
has spread across all 50 states

01:55.289 --> 01:59.206
with over 40,000 fast
food outlets nationwide.

01:59.249 --> 02:00.685
Fast food was
in this boom time.

02:00.729 --> 02:02.383
It was a gold rush.

02:02.426 --> 02:04.776
There wasn't just
workers in urban centers,

02:04.820 --> 02:06.909
families, all demographics
were eating there.

02:06.952 --> 02:09.172
It was really food
for the people

02:09.216 --> 02:13.350
in a way that attracted
crowds of all ages to come.

02:13.394 --> 02:15.004
But at the time,

02:15.047 --> 02:18.094
fast food is centered
around one menu item.

02:18.138 --> 02:18.921
The burger.

02:20.836 --> 02:23.839
The hamburger industry
was incredibly saturated.

02:23.882 --> 02:27.190
There were a million hamburger
places across the country

02:27.234 --> 02:29.105
and McDonald's of
course was dominating,

02:29.149 --> 02:31.368
but people wanted
an alternative.

02:31.412 --> 02:33.892
Savvy
entrepreneurs start introducing

02:33.936 --> 02:36.504
new choices and alternatives

02:36.547 --> 02:39.333
like Taco Bell,
Kentucky Fried Chicken,

02:39.376 --> 02:42.553
and Pizza Hut start
to flood the scene.

02:42.597 --> 02:45.687
People are increasingly
relying on convenience foods.

02:45.730 --> 02:48.820
All of those foods have
dangerous numbers of calories.

02:48.864 --> 02:50.996
We're living in a kind of
unhealthy food landscape

02:51.040 --> 02:51.693
by that point.

02:52.911 --> 02:55.218
Now a
$20 billion industry,

02:55.262 --> 03:00.049
fast food's impact on the
American waistline is massive.

03:00.092 --> 03:03.835
With the average man's weight
increasing by six pounds

03:03.879 --> 03:07.665
in just five years,
leading the government

03:07.709 --> 03:11.843
to make an unprecedented
move in 1964.

03:11.887 --> 03:14.933
They recommend adults reduce
their daily food intake

03:14.977 --> 03:17.153
by 300 calories.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.981
This leaves Americans in need

03:19.024 --> 03:21.375
of healthier food
options on the go.

03:24.291 --> 03:25.814
But in Connecticut,

03:25.857 --> 03:28.773
17 year old high school graduate
Fred DeLuca isn't thinking

03:28.817 --> 03:30.601
about food at all.

03:30.645 --> 03:31.820
He just needs money.

03:34.039 --> 03:35.563
I'm so sorry I'm late.

03:35.606 --> 03:37.173
It took me a minute
to find this place.

03:37.217 --> 03:40.785
Fred DeLuca is a
really bright, driven,

03:40.829 --> 03:42.396
ambitious young man.

03:42.439 --> 03:43.397
What do you think?

03:45.007 --> 03:49.403
He grows up in poverty in
the projects in the Bronx,

03:50.708 --> 03:53.189
but still sets his
sight on medical school.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.844
And he needs money
to go to school

03:55.887 --> 03:57.759
to pursue these
dreams that he has.

03:59.543 --> 04:01.110
I'm sorry.

04:01.153 --> 04:02.416
Why am I here again?

04:04.026 --> 04:06.246
Well, the other day at my
barbecue, you asked about money?

04:06.289 --> 04:09.074
Yeah, to pay for college
and medical school.

04:09.118 --> 04:11.120
I was just wondering
if you had some advice.

04:11.163 --> 04:11.947
I do.

04:13.818 --> 04:15.211
Start a business.

04:16.778 --> 04:19.084
But I'm just a kid.

04:19.128 --> 04:22.044
What kind of business
would I start?

04:22.087 --> 04:24.220
Pete Buck was a family friend.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.744
He was sort of like
an uncle unofficially.

04:26.788 --> 04:28.485
He had barbecues

04:28.529 --> 04:32.968
and frequently invited the
DeLucas over to his home.

04:33.011 --> 04:39.279
Pete was a nuclear physicist
and has a entrepreneurial bent.

04:39.322 --> 04:42.369
As he reads newspaper
articles and magazine articles

04:42.412 --> 04:44.893
about different
businesses, he gets ideas.

04:47.548 --> 04:50.420
Have you ever
heard of a submarine?

04:50.464 --> 04:51.856
Yeah.

04:51.900 --> 04:53.641
Like, like an underwater boat?

04:54.598 --> 04:55.686
No.

04:55.730 --> 04:56.818
Like the sandwich.

04:57.993 --> 04:59.081
Never.

05:00.604 --> 05:03.259
At the time,
sandwiches aren't a business

05:03.303 --> 05:05.696
and are a far cry from
today's equivalent.

05:05.740 --> 05:07.219
We live in a world now

05:07.263 --> 05:10.310
where getting a long
sandwich is incredibly easy,

05:10.353 --> 05:12.050
there's lots of variety.

05:12.094 --> 05:16.838
But now go back when sliced
bread itself was fairly new,

05:18.405 --> 05:22.322
sandwiches might be head
cheese, bologna and cheese,

05:23.410 --> 05:27.327
butter and sugar, marmalade.

05:27.370 --> 05:29.372
The US sandwich game
was kind of weak, right?

05:29.416 --> 05:32.157
You look at a couple slices of
bread, maybe some cold cuts.

05:32.201 --> 05:33.420
Seems a little anemic.

05:34.812 --> 05:36.379
But while
most are homemade,

05:36.423 --> 05:38.338
a new sandwich is arriving,

05:38.381 --> 05:40.122
hidden in urban
Italian communities

05:40.165 --> 05:41.863
across the Northeast.

05:43.908 --> 05:45.345
The submarine sandwich.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.652
Slice it into pieces

05:48.696 --> 05:52.352
and people would just help
themselves to a little section.

05:52.395 --> 05:54.571
They were regional,
they were local.

05:54.615 --> 05:56.660
They were Italian finger food

05:56.704 --> 05:59.228
long before they were
ever $5 foot longs.

06:00.882 --> 06:04.451
In the sixties, these
were not popular sandwiches

06:04.494 --> 06:06.409
unless you were in an
Italian neighborhood

06:06.453 --> 06:08.933
where there was an Italian deli.

06:08.977 --> 06:11.762
Most people didn't know
about this at the time.

06:11.806 --> 06:13.982
The origin of submarine
sandwiches is something

06:14.025 --> 06:16.245
that's kind of hotly debated.

06:16.288 --> 06:19.727
One account says it came
from an Italian immigrant

06:19.770 --> 06:23.121
named Dominic Conti from
my hometown of New York

06:23.165 --> 06:26.734
and he began selling
Italian sandwiches

06:26.777 --> 06:28.475
out of a deli he operated

06:28.518 --> 06:31.347
in the earliest parts
of the 20th century.

06:31.391 --> 06:34.959
Supposedly he named his sandwich

06:35.003 --> 06:38.267
after a submarine
called the Fenian Ram,

06:38.310 --> 06:41.966
which was used to
repel English invaders

06:42.010 --> 06:45.753
in the latter half
of the 19th century.

06:47.058 --> 06:49.409
You wanted my money
advice, so here's my offer.

06:51.933 --> 06:53.935
I'll put up the money
to start the business.

06:53.978 --> 06:56.154
$1,000.

06:56.198 --> 06:57.678
You'll do a lot of the leg work.

06:57.721 --> 06:59.157
When the money
starts rolling in,

06:59.201 --> 07:00.420
you take half of the profits

07:00.463 --> 07:02.117
and you set it aside
to pay for school.

07:05.468 --> 07:06.295
Why me?

07:07.949 --> 07:09.733
You're the only person
who hasn't said I'm nuts.

07:14.346 --> 07:15.130
Okay.

07:17.306 --> 07:20.918
Pete is a visionary
and he's got some money.

07:20.962 --> 07:24.052
And why not do
something different

07:24.095 --> 07:26.837
beyond being a
nuclear physicist?

07:26.881 --> 07:30.667
When you have an entrepreneurial
urge, why not play it out?

07:30.711 --> 07:32.713
Let's see what we can build.

07:32.756 --> 07:35.498
Pete Buck has a
career in the sciences.

07:35.542 --> 07:37.108
Fred wants one.

07:37.152 --> 07:40.242
You have a bit of a mentor
that he has found in Pete Buck.

07:40.285 --> 07:44.768
Two very intelligent,
scientifically minded men,

07:44.812 --> 07:46.901
albeit from very
different generations.

07:48.293 --> 07:52.559
So show me how to
make these submarines.

07:52.602 --> 07:54.778
Oh, I don't know
how to do that.

07:54.822 --> 07:57.999
Which is why our first
step is collecting data.

07:59.696 --> 08:04.179
It's crazy that Fred and Pete
decide to create a business

08:04.222 --> 08:06.355
that's going to sell a sandwich

08:06.398 --> 08:09.010
that neither one of them
had ever made or eaten.

08:10.925 --> 08:12.535
The first thing they've
gotta do is figure out,

08:12.579 --> 08:14.450
what is a
submarine sandwich?

08:14.494 --> 08:15.669
What does it taste like?

08:15.712 --> 08:16.539
What does it look like?

08:16.583 --> 08:18.715
How do you build these?

08:18.759 --> 08:22.850
One day, Buck
and DeLuca's simple concept

08:22.893 --> 08:27.115
will give rise to the biggest
restaurant chain in the world,

08:27.158 --> 08:29.552
found in over 100 countries

08:29.596 --> 08:33.208
with nearly double the amount
of US locations as McDonald's.

08:34.557 --> 08:36.646
Worth over $10 billion

08:36.690 --> 08:39.693
and selling over 5,000
sandwiches every minute.

08:42.565 --> 08:47.439
But for now, they have no
idea that 70 miles away,

08:47.483 --> 08:49.572
two high school friends have

08:49.616 --> 08:51.400
more than a year's
head start on them.

08:53.837 --> 08:57.275
So Tony Conza and Peter
DeCarlo are Jersey guys

08:57.319 --> 09:01.497
and they would go down to
the Jersey shore to vacation.

09:01.541 --> 09:06.067
While they're down there, they
see this submarine sandwich.

09:06.110 --> 09:07.808
Conza sees an opportunity here.

09:07.851 --> 09:10.332
It's unique, it's fresh,

09:10.375 --> 09:13.074
and it's something that's
going to make me money.

09:14.379 --> 09:16.207
At age 24,

09:16.251 --> 09:19.428
Tony Conza and Peter
DeCarlo quit their jobs

09:19.471 --> 09:20.777
and risk everything

09:20.821 --> 09:25.216
to open a sandwich stand
they call Blimpie Base,

09:25.260 --> 09:27.741
named after the shape of
the sandwiches they sell.

09:29.351 --> 09:31.788
Tony Conza of
Blimpie is essentially

09:31.832 --> 09:33.877
like the Wolf of Eat Street.

09:33.921 --> 09:37.620
He's a Wall Street clerk and
he learned everything he knows

09:37.664 --> 09:40.710
about business by watching
real Wall Street sharks.

09:40.754 --> 09:44.105
Very slick, total entrepreneur.

09:44.148 --> 09:47.021
Peter DeCarlo was a detail
guy, he was an implementer.

09:47.064 --> 09:49.023
You know, he took Tony's
big ideas and said,

09:49.066 --> 09:50.198
okay, this is how
we're gonna do it.

09:50.241 --> 09:51.808
And we need this,
this, and this.

09:51.852 --> 09:54.028
Conza
and DeCarlo's vision

09:54.071 --> 09:56.596
for their sub
sandwich is unique.

09:56.639 --> 09:59.207
They had the idea of
just stacking a sandwich

09:59.250 --> 10:01.688
with a bunch of lettuce
and other greens.

10:01.731 --> 10:05.213
It was layered with
tons of vegetables and oil

10:05.256 --> 10:07.650
and vinegar and spices
drizzled on top.

10:07.694 --> 10:10.305
This is a salad on a sandwich.

10:10.348 --> 10:11.654
That's our specialty.

10:11.698 --> 10:13.613
It's like two meals in one.

10:13.656 --> 10:15.223
There you go.

10:15.266 --> 10:17.312
This was something that was
fairly unusual at the time.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.924
Priced at 75 cents,

10:20.968 --> 10:23.405
Conza and DeCarlo hoped
to draw customers away

10:23.448 --> 10:26.451
from fast food restaurants
like McDonald's

10:26.495 --> 10:27.975
with their salad on a sandwich,

10:29.454 --> 10:32.806
marketed as a healthier
alternative to burgers.

10:32.849 --> 10:34.198
In the food world in America,

10:34.242 --> 10:35.852
it's all about the marketing.

10:35.896 --> 10:38.855
Blimpie came up at the same
time as Americans beginning

10:38.899 --> 10:42.685
to sort of watch what they
eat and count their calories.

10:42.729 --> 10:46.297
Blimpie understood what
Americans would want to eat.

10:46.341 --> 10:47.603
You think like, yeah,

10:47.647 --> 10:49.692
I'm making a healthy
choice by getting this.

10:49.736 --> 10:52.869
The salad on a
sandwich concept takes off

10:52.913 --> 10:54.523
with health conscious consumers.

10:56.481 --> 10:58.658
It's the basis of
a restaurant chain

10:58.701 --> 11:01.661
that will one day
boast 2,000 stores,

11:01.704 --> 11:04.838
reach over half a billion
dollars in annual sales,

11:04.881 --> 11:08.537
and revolutionize how fast food
is sold around the country.

11:12.759 --> 11:16.719
But first, they need to
learn how to run a business

11:16.763 --> 11:18.199
with an unproven product.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.203
These guys have no
restaurant experience

11:22.246 --> 11:25.597
and their lack of
restaurant experience begins

11:25.641 --> 11:27.774
to show almost immediately.

11:29.471 --> 11:31.081
There you go, sir, have
a good one, enjoy that.

11:31.125 --> 11:33.867
They had to be
aware of their competition

11:35.042 --> 11:36.652
and they simply weren't.

11:37.958 --> 11:39.437
Hey, welcome to Blimpie's.

11:39.481 --> 11:41.178
What can I get you?

11:41.222 --> 11:45.052
Yeah, actually I'd like
your most popular sandwich.

11:46.793 --> 11:49.012
For now, Fred
DeLuca doesn't pose a threat

11:49.056 --> 11:53.582
to Blimpie, but a war of
innovation is beginning

11:53.625 --> 11:55.715
and a race to be the
first to bring one

11:55.758 --> 11:59.414
of America's most iconic
foods to the nation.

12:05.115 --> 12:07.814
As the US economy
booms in the 1960s,

12:07.857 --> 12:09.903
the demand for labor increases

12:09.946 --> 12:11.687
and baby boomers begin working.

12:13.384 --> 12:17.911
And in 1965, 22 million women
are now in the labor market,

12:18.868 --> 12:21.784
a 35% increase from 1950,

12:21.828 --> 12:24.831
making food on the go a
necessary convenience.

12:27.572 --> 12:29.749
In Bridgeport, Connecticut,

12:29.792 --> 12:32.534
Pete Buck and Fred
DeLuca are under pressure

12:32.577 --> 12:34.754
to get their operation
up and running

12:34.797 --> 12:36.625
and keep up with
the competition.

12:36.668 --> 12:38.235
Okay.

12:38.279 --> 12:40.803
But first they
need a sandwich to sell.

12:40.847 --> 12:45.373
That is one from every
spot in the tri-state area.

12:45.416 --> 12:47.201
Well, now we know
we're not the first.

12:47.244 --> 12:48.550
We just have to be the best.

12:50.247 --> 12:52.554
They don't know
what they're doing.

12:52.597 --> 12:56.471
It was just let's go out
and sample some sandwiches

12:56.514 --> 12:58.778
to get an idea of what we
need and how we do this.

13:00.649 --> 13:03.870
They got analytical, they
broke down the sandwich.

13:03.913 --> 13:06.481
They analyzed the
bread, the spread,

13:06.524 --> 13:09.397
the main ingredients, and
the garnishes as well.

13:11.051 --> 13:13.096
After getting
a taste of the competition,

13:13.140 --> 13:16.883
Buck and DeLuca design a
set menu of seven sandwiches

13:16.926 --> 13:19.624
built around meats
like salami and turkey,

13:19.668 --> 13:21.975
priced at 69 cents each.

13:22.018 --> 13:24.151
Hey, what are we
gonna call this place?

13:25.630 --> 13:27.241
Oh, I thought of
the perfect name.

13:30.113 --> 13:32.899
On
August 28th, 1965,

13:32.942 --> 13:35.815
they opened Pete's Submarines.

13:35.858 --> 13:39.035
Opening day of Pete's
Submarine sandwiches,

13:39.079 --> 13:41.429
they sell out of everything.

13:41.472 --> 13:43.910
This was the family
and friends coming out

13:43.953 --> 13:47.348
to support Fred's
and Pete's business.

13:48.697 --> 13:53.528
As the days wore on,
the line disappeared.

13:57.140 --> 13:58.576
Hey!

13:58.620 --> 13:59.926
What can we get for you?

13:59.969 --> 14:01.841
Can I get a
small pizza please?

14:02.929 --> 14:04.713
Oh, we don't serve pizza.

14:05.757 --> 14:08.325
But isn't this Pizza Marines?

14:08.369 --> 14:12.286
It's Pete's, that's
him, Submarines.

14:13.940 --> 14:18.118
Pizza Marines, Pete's
Submarines, Pizza Marines!

14:18.161 --> 14:19.684
Oorah!

14:19.728 --> 14:22.557
Pizza Marines, that's what
they called it on the radio.

14:25.734 --> 14:28.476
With sales
as low as $7 a day,

14:28.519 --> 14:30.739
Buck and DeLuca don't
have the capital

14:30.782 --> 14:32.654
to stay open much longer.

14:32.697 --> 14:35.526
They could skimp
on paying themselves,

14:35.570 --> 14:37.833
but just to pay for the
bread and the ingredients,

14:37.877 --> 14:41.141
the produce and the meat, was
costly, just to pay the rent.

14:45.972 --> 14:47.930
What are we gonna do?

14:47.974 --> 14:50.715
Well, we could
make some changes,

14:50.759 --> 14:54.023
see if things improve,
but we can't wing it.

14:54.067 --> 14:55.329
To most people,

14:55.372 --> 14:57.897
this would've been the
end of their business.

15:01.639 --> 15:02.858
We need a control group.

15:03.815 --> 15:04.991
A what?

15:05.034 --> 15:06.427
In every scientific experiment,

15:06.470 --> 15:08.081
you test things in
two different groups.

15:08.124 --> 15:10.953
One group, you change,
the other, you don't.

15:10.997 --> 15:11.823
The control group.

15:14.870 --> 15:16.219
We need another sandwich shop

15:16.263 --> 15:18.961
to see if our changes
are making a difference.

15:19.005 --> 15:23.226
Shockingly, when anybody
else probably would say,

15:23.270 --> 15:26.186
let's throw in the towel
and close this store,

15:27.274 --> 15:29.319
they don't think
that way at all.

15:29.363 --> 15:31.582
They were eager to experiment.

15:31.626 --> 15:33.062
Wait.

15:33.106 --> 15:36.457
Are you saying we should
open up a second store?

15:36.500 --> 15:37.284
Yeah.

15:38.676 --> 15:40.026
That's exactly what I'm saying.

15:41.592 --> 15:43.029
Rather than collapse,

15:43.072 --> 15:45.596
they go in a completely
opposite direction

15:45.640 --> 15:47.294
that no one expected.

15:47.337 --> 15:48.991
Think about that.

15:49.035 --> 15:52.821
Facing extinction, they
open a second restaurant.

15:52.864 --> 15:55.258
It's a huge risk.

15:55.302 --> 15:57.391
While Buck
and DeLuca experiment,

16:00.176 --> 16:04.528
in Hoboken, Blimpie is selling
their salad on a sandwich

16:04.572 --> 16:07.096
to so many hungry
office workers.

16:07.140 --> 16:10.404
A bit more lucrative than
our old summer jobs, huh?

16:10.447 --> 16:11.709
That they
gamble their profits

16:11.753 --> 16:13.755
on opening two more stores

16:13.798 --> 16:16.236
within three months of
opening their first.

16:16.279 --> 16:18.064
We have another
loan payment due,

16:18.107 --> 16:19.282
not to mention utility bills.

16:19.326 --> 16:21.763
All that money's
already spent, Tony.

16:21.806 --> 16:24.592
Just wait till we have a few
dozen stores up and running.

16:24.635 --> 16:27.247
We can barely keep up with
the three stores we have now.

16:29.205 --> 16:31.120
Most people say
restaurants need years

16:31.164 --> 16:32.208
to become profitable.

16:32.252 --> 16:33.644
Tony Conza, like a year later,

16:33.688 --> 16:35.516
he's already like this
is working, let's go.

16:35.559 --> 16:37.953
He was ambitious and he pushed.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.563
He pushed that envelope.

16:39.607 --> 16:43.263
And while that's exciting,
that can cause problems.

16:45.308 --> 16:49.878
One day, we are
gonna own 300 stores

16:49.921 --> 16:52.707
and we are gonna be the biggest
sandwich chain in the world.

16:54.752 --> 16:55.971
Maybe then you'll realize

16:56.015 --> 16:57.451
what a moron you
sound like right now.

17:00.845 --> 17:02.369
Your turn to lock up.

17:04.501 --> 17:06.329
Blimpie
has broken new ground

17:06.373 --> 17:10.116
becoming the nation's first
fast food sandwich chain,

17:10.159 --> 17:13.032
and dozens of well
known names will follow.

17:13.075 --> 17:16.122
But with cracks already
showing in their foundation,

17:16.165 --> 17:18.341
the partners must see eye to eye

17:18.385 --> 17:19.995
before they can
conquer the nation.

17:24.869 --> 17:29.048
By 1968, there are over
250 fast food chains,

17:29.091 --> 17:33.052
a 20-fold increase from
the postwar period.

17:33.095 --> 17:36.751
This rapid expansion is
thanks to a tested strategy.

17:36.794 --> 17:39.014
Franchising is a system

17:39.058 --> 17:40.711
that the franchise
all puts together

17:40.755 --> 17:44.411
and that system is then licensed

17:44.454 --> 17:47.414
to a third party, a franchisee.

17:47.457 --> 17:50.069
In exchange, they charge a fee.

17:53.463 --> 17:55.291
In New Jersey,

17:55.335 --> 17:58.294
Conza sets his sights on
taking Blimpie national

17:58.338 --> 18:01.384
by using the strategy
and has plunged profits

18:01.428 --> 18:04.605
into growing to 10 locations
across the Northeast.

18:05.823 --> 18:07.303
Turkey supplier was just here

18:07.347 --> 18:10.524
and apparently we owed
him a few thousand bucks.

18:10.567 --> 18:13.004
I just had to pay him
outta the cash register.

18:13.048 --> 18:15.181
If you don't
understand franchising,

18:15.224 --> 18:18.532
you now have huge
amounts of problems.

18:18.575 --> 18:21.404
That money was for
our loan payment.

18:21.448 --> 18:23.798
We don't have enough money
to cover all these expenses.

18:24.929 --> 18:25.626
So?

18:26.540 --> 18:27.845
Any ideas?

18:27.889 --> 18:29.020
They were losing
a lot of money

18:29.064 --> 18:30.239
because they didn't
know quite how

18:30.283 --> 18:31.980
to run an expanding business.

18:32.023 --> 18:33.982
You know, money needed to
go back into advertising,

18:34.025 --> 18:36.027
stores, and distribution.

18:36.071 --> 18:37.986
So all of a sudden
they realized,

18:38.029 --> 18:41.859
wow, we're selling tons of
sandwiches, why are we broke?

18:41.903 --> 18:44.427
But that couldn't stop Conza.

18:44.471 --> 18:46.168
Let's stop running
the stores ourselves.

18:46.212 --> 18:48.910
We'll let somebody else
deal with the day to day.

18:48.953 --> 18:50.651
That way we can
focus on expansion.

18:52.479 --> 18:54.785
We have a limited window
of opportunity here.

18:54.829 --> 18:57.223
That means moving fast and
seizing the market before-

18:57.266 --> 18:58.963
Before anyone
else does, I know.

19:00.269 --> 19:02.358
Our problem is we're
not making enough profit

19:02.402 --> 19:04.186
from the stores we already have.

19:04.230 --> 19:06.667
How does adding
stores solve that?

19:10.061 --> 19:10.975
Do you have any better ideas?

19:15.197 --> 19:17.330
Tomorrow, we start looking
for new franchisees.

19:19.070 --> 19:21.247
Conza accelerates
Blimpie's expansion plan

19:21.290 --> 19:24.554
to open 100 new stores
across the Northeast.

19:24.598 --> 19:26.469
Conza wants to franchise

19:26.513 --> 19:29.298
and grow the brand
across the country,

19:29.342 --> 19:33.520
so he is selling off franchises
to anyone who wants one.

19:33.563 --> 19:34.956
No discrimination.

19:34.999 --> 19:37.219
You want a Blimpie's,
you get a Blimpie's.

19:37.263 --> 19:39.308
Blimpie
introduces the sub sandwich

19:39.352 --> 19:42.311
to new markets for
the very first time

19:42.355 --> 19:45.401
and becomes the biggest
sandwich chain in the country

19:45.445 --> 19:48.056
with no competition, for now.

19:50.493 --> 19:53.061
Meanwhile, Buck and
DeLuca are gambling

19:53.104 --> 19:55.890
what little money they have
left to open their second shop.

19:57.283 --> 19:59.372
For nuclear
physicist, Pete Buck,

19:59.415 --> 20:03.463
it's an expensive scientific
test to improve their operation

20:03.506 --> 20:05.900
with a method known
as AB testing.

20:08.076 --> 20:10.731
You try something at
location A that works

20:10.774 --> 20:13.255
and then you try
something at location B.

20:13.299 --> 20:15.431
You have a basis for comparison.

20:15.475 --> 20:17.303
I think like most
good scientists,

20:17.346 --> 20:21.307
they see challenges as
a puzzle to be solved.

20:21.350 --> 20:26.137
And he applies that
methodical, experimental,

20:26.181 --> 20:29.053
evaluative nature
to his business

20:29.097 --> 20:31.969
even though it had never
really been applied

20:32.013 --> 20:33.754
to the restaurant world.

20:36.322 --> 20:38.889
They changed the
configuration of the store.

20:38.933 --> 20:41.283
They'd make changes in
the hours of operation.

20:41.327 --> 20:42.850
They'd use different bread,

20:42.893 --> 20:45.113
different toppings
on sandwiches.

20:46.723 --> 20:48.159
Their
breakthrough ideas include

20:48.203 --> 20:51.119
moving profitable items,
such as chips and candy bars,

20:51.162 --> 20:54.427
right by the register as
tempting add-ons for customers.

20:55.906 --> 20:58.909
And expanding parking
to make it an easy place

20:58.953 --> 21:00.781
for a quick pit stop.

21:00.824 --> 21:02.261
But their biggest idea...

21:02.304 --> 21:04.741
Pete, what if you
turn all the way around?

21:04.785 --> 21:08.310
Is a groundbreaking
change not just for them,

21:08.354 --> 21:10.269
but for the entire
food industry.

21:11.705 --> 21:13.315
I can see what you're doing.

21:13.359 --> 21:16.144
Feels more involved, like I'm
helping you make my sandwich.

21:20.627 --> 21:22.933
While other
shops only offer a fixed menu

21:22.977 --> 21:26.415
of sandwiches, Buck and DeLuca
begin allowing customers

21:26.459 --> 21:29.940
to choose exactly how they
want their sandwiches made.

21:29.984 --> 21:32.160
What they did was
so incredibly unique.

21:32.203 --> 21:35.337
They allowed you to experience
the building of the sandwich.

21:35.381 --> 21:38.253
And so not only were they
making you a sandwich fresh,

21:38.297 --> 21:41.082
they were allowing you to
sort of choose and pick

21:41.125 --> 21:44.128
and craft this thing
especially for you.

21:44.172 --> 21:47.044
They may finally
have their winning formula,

21:47.088 --> 21:49.177
save for one more
crucial change.

21:51.484 --> 21:54.269
They knew that they needed
to rename their business

21:54.313 --> 21:57.446
from Pete's Submarines
to something else.

21:57.490 --> 22:01.537
You had someone from Connecticut
and someone from the Bronx.

22:01.581 --> 22:03.278
People close enough
to New York City

22:03.322 --> 22:06.020
to know about our iconic
mass transit system.

22:08.805 --> 22:09.676
The subway.

22:11.242 --> 22:13.593
In 1968, Buck
and DeLuca opened the doors

22:13.636 --> 22:16.291
to the first ever
Subway restaurant.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.467
Extra pickles,
please, and no mayo.

22:18.511 --> 22:19.207
You got it.

22:20.426 --> 22:21.688
Would you like for me to cut it?

22:21.731 --> 22:23.254
No thanks.

22:23.298 --> 22:26.823
Subway's new
customizable system is a smash

22:28.390 --> 22:32.220
and inspires fast food
chains for decades to come.

22:32.263 --> 22:34.831
I mean, Burger King said
you could have it your way,

22:34.875 --> 22:36.659
but you don't get to
look at the ingredients.

22:36.703 --> 22:39.053
This was the first place to
have it all laid out there

22:39.096 --> 22:40.837
for the consumer to pick.

22:40.881 --> 22:43.231
I want turkey, I want
lettuce, I want green pepper,

22:43.274 --> 22:45.494
I want this and so forth,
and move along that line,

22:45.538 --> 22:48.628
which has now been imitated
by so many other competitors.

22:48.671 --> 22:51.021
These weren't
restaurateurs to begin with.

22:51.065 --> 22:53.372
These were scientists.

22:53.415 --> 22:56.462
So by the time they
were ready to scale up

22:56.505 --> 23:00.422
and become a major
chain, it was perfect.

23:00.466 --> 23:02.032
Buck
and DeLuca are ready

23:02.076 --> 23:05.732
to unleash their sandwich shop
model across the Northeast.

23:05.775 --> 23:08.387
But while they still have a
distance to catch their rivals,

23:12.086 --> 23:16.046
Blimpie's aggressive expansion
push is proving costly.

23:16.090 --> 23:17.918
Blimpie had problems
with quality control.

23:17.961 --> 23:19.659
They had sort of
given franchises

23:19.702 --> 23:22.357
to whoever would sign
up for a franchise

23:22.401 --> 23:24.446
and they didn't
really monitor them.

23:24.490 --> 23:27.449
There was not a lot of
consistency in management

23:27.493 --> 23:29.712
or in cleanliness or product.

23:29.756 --> 23:32.062
So you never knew
what you were getting.

23:32.106 --> 23:34.717
With the company's
reputation in free fall,

23:34.761 --> 23:36.632
sales plunge.

23:36.676 --> 23:38.982
Location after
location was failing

23:39.026 --> 23:42.464
and now they found
themselves severely in debt.

23:42.508 --> 23:43.813
Like forget about Blimpie,

23:43.857 --> 23:46.076
this is much more
Hindenberg-like.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.603
Now a
decade after it began,

23:51.821 --> 23:53.388
the high school
friends' partnership

23:53.432 --> 23:55.608
is at a breaking point.

23:56.652 --> 23:57.610
Here's a contract.

23:59.176 --> 24:00.917
If you sign, that means
we're splitting Blimpie

24:00.961 --> 24:02.484
into two different companies.

24:02.528 --> 24:04.225
There's no way any partnership

24:04.268 --> 24:06.183
in restaurant or
otherwise can work

24:06.227 --> 24:09.404
if both partners are
thinking different things,

24:09.448 --> 24:11.885
want to go in
different directions.

24:11.928 --> 24:14.061
I keep all the New
York area stores?

24:14.104 --> 24:15.628
Yes.

24:15.671 --> 24:17.717
And then I'm free to keep
expanding into new territories

24:17.760 --> 24:22.591
without anything or
anyone holding me back.

24:32.471 --> 24:34.908
So they each go
their separate ways now

24:34.951 --> 24:36.779
with their own
regions of Blimpie,

24:36.823 --> 24:39.521
which if you're trying to keep
your franchises consistent,

24:39.565 --> 24:42.655
this is a recipe for disaster.

24:44.570 --> 24:47.355
While Blimpie and
its 100 shops are fractured,

24:48.835 --> 24:50.880
Buck and DeLuca's formula
is paying dividends

24:50.924 --> 24:53.187
as the chain grows rapidly

24:53.230 --> 24:56.973
and hits 32 stores by 1976.

24:58.018 --> 25:00.890
But as they gear up to
push west and south,

25:00.934 --> 25:03.153
Subway's expansion hits a snag

25:03.197 --> 25:05.982
when they can no longer
source a critical ingredient.

25:07.984 --> 25:12.249
In those early years, Fred
would actually go buy bread

25:12.293 --> 25:15.252
and deliver it to
the franchisees.

25:15.296 --> 25:16.776
At one point, though,

25:16.819 --> 25:21.171
someone wanted to open
a Subway in Maryland,

25:21.215 --> 25:25.828
more than an hour or two
away from Connecticut.

25:25.872 --> 25:29.223
One of the big issues is,
where you gonna get the bread?

25:30.833 --> 25:32.574
Blimpie is
still ahead in the race

25:32.618 --> 25:35.316
to bring sub
sandwiches nationwide,

25:35.359 --> 25:38.406
but Subway is about to
unleash a new innovation

25:38.449 --> 25:41.496
that might finally, after
more than a decade of chasing,

25:41.540 --> 25:43.063
catapult them ahead.

25:48.111 --> 25:49.809
It's 1978
and Subway's expansion

25:49.852 --> 25:52.551
beyond the Northeast
suddenly stops.

25:54.683 --> 25:56.729
Without enough local
Italian providers

25:56.772 --> 25:58.557
to meet demand for bread,

25:58.600 --> 26:01.995
Buck and DeLuca are forced
to sacrifice authenticity

26:02.038 --> 26:04.911
and turn to national
wholesale bakeries,

26:04.954 --> 26:09.350
testing Subway sandwich recipes
with mass market options.

26:09.393 --> 26:11.047
This one's too crusty.

26:11.091 --> 26:12.353
That one's too soggy.

26:12.396 --> 26:13.963
Always you and the bread, man.

26:14.007 --> 26:16.531
That's the first part
of the sandwich you touch.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.359
The first part that
hits your mouth.

26:21.623 --> 26:25.540
My mother, when
she makes bread,

26:25.584 --> 26:28.064
the smell would fill
up the entire house.

26:28.108 --> 26:30.458
Made us hungry.

26:34.549 --> 26:36.029
Why don't we make our own bread?

26:37.465 --> 26:38.945
I mean, no one else
is doing that, right?

26:38.988 --> 26:41.643
Not Blimpie, not anybody.

26:41.687 --> 26:44.211
We'd have to put an
oven in every location.

26:44.254 --> 26:45.734
Yeah, but the
smell would hit 'em

26:45.778 --> 26:47.606
as soon as they
walk in the doors.

26:49.085 --> 26:50.565
At a time

26:50.609 --> 26:52.523
when every fast food
restaurant outsources baking

26:52.567 --> 26:56.136
of their buns, Buck and
DeLuca take out huge loans

26:56.179 --> 26:58.529
to retool their stores,

26:58.573 --> 27:01.968
installing ovens and hoods
and rewiring the electricity

27:02.011 --> 27:04.448
in every one of their
100 stores adds up

27:04.492 --> 27:08.801
to over $450,000
or 2 million today.

27:11.194 --> 27:12.979
It's an expensive gamble,

27:13.022 --> 27:14.981
with the company's
growth riding on it.

27:22.815 --> 27:25.992
Back in New York, DeCarlo
works night and day

27:26.035 --> 27:30.300
to maintain consistency in
his 100 Blimpie locations.

27:30.344 --> 27:34.653
Pragmatic DeCarlo, he wants
to improve the locations

27:34.696 --> 27:38.134
that already exist instead
of adding new ones.

27:38.178 --> 27:41.877
Meanwhile, Tony Conza,
seeing the success of Subway,

27:41.921 --> 27:44.924
he wanted to do something big.

27:44.967 --> 27:46.534
Conza
makes a bold move

27:46.577 --> 27:48.492
to pull further ahead of Subway

27:48.536 --> 27:52.583
and opens 200 new franchises
in uncharted territory.

27:52.627 --> 27:55.761
Tony looked at the South
as a huge space to grow in.

27:55.804 --> 27:59.547
He really brought the idea
of the sub to America.

27:59.590 --> 28:01.375
And a lot of people
don't realize that.

28:01.418 --> 28:03.116
He'd introduced the
rest of the country

28:03.159 --> 28:05.466
to the salad in a sandwich.

28:05.509 --> 28:07.033
Despite
cementing their position

28:07.076 --> 28:09.862
as the country's
largest sandwich chain,

28:09.905 --> 28:13.039
Conza and DeCarlo's broken
partnership takes its toll.

28:14.780 --> 28:18.566
Losing Peter DeCarlo, Tony
really lost his details guy.

28:18.609 --> 28:21.787
Peter, he really lost
the big ideas guy.

28:21.830 --> 28:24.006
You can imagine, after
a decade together,

28:24.050 --> 28:26.748
these gentlemen had a shorthand

28:26.792 --> 28:28.663
and you can't just hire
another guy to come in

28:28.707 --> 28:29.620
and know your shorthand.

28:29.664 --> 28:31.666
It doesn't work like that.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.668
While
Blimpie remains divided,

28:36.236 --> 28:40.066
Subway now has new five rack
ovens in every location.

28:41.807 --> 28:45.158
Now they don't have to worry
about relying on a bakery.

28:45.201 --> 28:47.377
The store can make
its own bread.

28:47.421 --> 28:48.683
The new
ovens produce one

28:48.727 --> 28:51.164
of Subway's most
signature attractions,

28:51.207 --> 28:53.688
pulling in hungry
customers from the street.

28:53.732 --> 28:56.343
An added advantage
was this whole idea

28:56.386 --> 28:58.737
that goes along with
grandma's house,

28:58.780 --> 29:00.173
that you're arriving at a place

29:00.216 --> 29:03.176
where you smell
the bread baking.

29:03.219 --> 29:04.481
It's a place you
want to go back to.

29:04.525 --> 29:05.700
It makes you happy.

29:07.136 --> 29:08.747
It's inconceivable to me

29:08.790 --> 29:10.444
that anybody would not
like the smell of Subway.

29:10.487 --> 29:13.926
I would say it's one of the
great unifiers of humanity.

29:15.623 --> 29:17.668
Subway's
freshly baked bread is a hit

29:17.712 --> 29:20.671
that propels them past
Blimpie for the first time,

29:20.715 --> 29:24.763
hitting 600 locations from
coast to coast by 1984.

29:24.806 --> 29:26.460
Yeah.

29:26.503 --> 29:27.722
They are now

29:27.766 --> 29:29.376
the go-to affordable
sandwich option

29:29.419 --> 29:31.378
for Americans
around the country.

29:32.814 --> 29:34.120
I had an office job

29:34.163 --> 29:36.122
where I was in charge
of ordering lunch.

29:36.165 --> 29:38.254
And you know how I kept
everything in check,

29:38.298 --> 29:40.039
how I wrangled it in?

29:40.082 --> 29:43.172
Hey guys, we're doing Subway.

29:43.216 --> 29:45.435
Subway is cheap, it's popular.

29:45.479 --> 29:48.308
People absolutely have a
need for that kind of thing.

29:48.351 --> 29:49.135
So that's Subway.

29:51.137 --> 29:53.008
Subway's rapid
rise attracts attention

29:53.052 --> 29:55.315
from the media and
business worlds,

29:55.358 --> 29:59.319
catapulting young founder Fred
DeLuca into the spotlight.

29:59.362 --> 30:03.149
By the 1980s, you've got
Subway and you've got Blimpie

30:03.192 --> 30:06.456
and it starts to become
a little antagonistic

30:06.500 --> 30:09.851
because Subway starts throwing
some mud in the press.

30:09.895 --> 30:11.853
But you weren't the first
sandwich shop on the block.

30:11.897 --> 30:13.072
What about Blimpie?

30:13.115 --> 30:14.508
They were around before
you, weren't they?

30:14.551 --> 30:15.944
Yes, they were.

30:15.988 --> 30:19.165
And the sandwiches that
they make are fine.

30:20.601 --> 30:22.733
Nobody does what Subway does.

30:22.777 --> 30:25.084
More options means
more for your money.

30:25.127 --> 30:28.217
And the difference is delicious.

30:28.261 --> 30:31.264
Fred DeLuca fired
some opening shots

30:31.307 --> 30:32.743
at Blimpie in the press.

30:32.787 --> 30:35.485
He actually told
the New York Times

30:35.529 --> 30:38.619
that Subway was by far
a superior sandwich,

30:38.662 --> 30:41.100
having tasted the
Blimpie sandwich.

30:41.143 --> 30:44.277
Plus he said that they
would get a better product

30:44.320 --> 30:46.105
and they would get
more for their money.

30:48.194 --> 30:50.239
Blimpie, they're doing things

30:50.283 --> 30:51.414
sort of three different ways.

30:51.458 --> 30:53.808
Subway's just got
this very focused plan

30:53.852 --> 30:55.288
and they're doing it one way.

30:55.331 --> 30:57.507
And that tells Tony something,

30:57.551 --> 31:00.075
that maybe something
needs to change.

31:00.119 --> 31:02.469
Unwilling to
settle for second best,

31:02.512 --> 31:05.646
Tony Conza has a big
idea to strike back.

31:06.952 --> 31:07.735
We gotta talk.

31:12.740 --> 31:14.176
By the mid 1980s,

31:14.220 --> 31:17.092
Blimpie and Subway have
transformed sandwiches

31:17.136 --> 31:18.572
into a lucrative business.

31:20.530 --> 31:22.141
And their success gives rise

31:22.184 --> 31:25.492
to a slew of competition
across the nation.

31:25.535 --> 31:27.015
Blimpie and Subway
were the originators

31:27.059 --> 31:28.974
of the fast food
sub sandwich chain.

31:29.017 --> 31:31.411
Now we also have Firehouse Subs,

31:31.454 --> 31:34.153
we have Jimmy John's,
and so many more.

31:34.196 --> 31:37.460
New sandwich
chains bring new ideas.

31:37.504 --> 31:41.377
Jimmy John's introduces
sandwich delivery in Illinois

31:41.421 --> 31:44.772
and Quiznos starts toasting
their subs in Colorado.

31:49.951 --> 31:51.910
With fierce competition
entering the race,

31:53.650 --> 31:57.002
Conza and DeCarlo's division
of Blimpie has put them at risk

31:57.045 --> 31:59.265
of falling further
behind Subway.

31:59.308 --> 32:02.137
Conza felt, hey,
we were here first.

32:02.181 --> 32:03.747
We're Italians from Jersey.

32:03.791 --> 32:06.054
This is our culture,
this is our sandwich.

32:06.098 --> 32:07.969
We were doing it,
we were successful.

32:08.013 --> 32:10.276
How dare this upstart brand

32:10.319 --> 32:13.801
from Connecticut approach
our success and beat it?

32:15.237 --> 32:17.457
We are losing and
we need to win.

32:23.071 --> 32:24.290
We can't go on like this.

32:26.814 --> 32:28.163
I know.

32:28.207 --> 32:28.947
You're right.

32:30.339 --> 32:31.906
Subway's killing us.

32:31.950 --> 32:34.300
These guys realize
that they've screwed up,

32:34.343 --> 32:35.823
that they need to come together

32:35.866 --> 32:38.130
or else Subway's just gonna
completely devour them.

32:40.001 --> 32:40.959
So what's your plan?

32:47.356 --> 32:52.013
Conza and DeCarlo
reunite to take on Subway.

32:52.057 --> 32:55.408
Even if you don't really
get along with your partner,

32:55.451 --> 32:58.367
when an opposing team
starts beating you,

32:58.411 --> 33:02.197
that's the time to close
ranks and join forces again

33:02.241 --> 33:04.547
against your common enemy.

33:04.591 --> 33:07.855
Well, I've been thinking
about what Subway isn't doing.

33:07.898 --> 33:08.682
Okay.

33:09.900 --> 33:10.684
I've got an idea.

33:13.513 --> 33:14.340
Okay.

33:17.996 --> 33:21.173
McDonald's has the Big Mac,
Burger King has the Whopper.

33:21.216 --> 33:23.131
One of the ways that Blimpie
decides they're gonna hit back,

33:23.175 --> 33:26.178
they need a signature sandwich.

33:26.221 --> 33:28.571
Signature
items on fast food menus

33:28.615 --> 33:30.878
have been a crucial
draw for customers

33:30.921 --> 33:34.447
since Burger King introduced
the Whopper in 1957.

33:34.490 --> 33:36.231
Everywhere else
had hamburgers,

33:36.275 --> 33:37.580
Burger King had the Whopper,

33:37.624 --> 33:38.799
and that's what made it special.

33:38.842 --> 33:41.062
That became its calling card.

33:41.106 --> 33:43.543
McDonald's
follows suit with the Big Mac

33:43.586 --> 33:47.068
in 1968 and other
restaurants are close behind.

33:47.112 --> 33:50.202
Pizza Hut introduces
its signature pan pizza

33:50.245 --> 33:54.641
and Taco Bell debuts the
Enchirito, both in 1973.

33:54.684 --> 33:57.426
Can you imagine McDonald's
without the Big Mac?

33:57.470 --> 34:01.648
Having that signature sandwich
definitely is important

34:01.691 --> 34:03.693
to the growth of a restaurant

34:03.737 --> 34:05.434
for the customer
to have a reference

34:05.478 --> 34:07.610
of why am I going in there?

34:07.654 --> 34:08.872
But at the time,

34:08.916 --> 34:10.961
neither Subway nor
Blimpie has names

34:11.005 --> 34:12.224
for any of their sandwiches.

34:13.616 --> 34:14.400
Until now.

34:15.749 --> 34:19.318
Conza's unique creation
is their largest sub yet

34:19.361 --> 34:22.930
and they dub it
the Blimpie Best.

34:22.973 --> 34:25.541
So they come up with
a soft foot long roll,

34:25.585 --> 34:29.328
with slow-cured ham, salami,
capicola, prosciuttini,

34:29.371 --> 34:34.159
provolone, topped with
onions, tomatoes, lettuce,

34:35.160 --> 34:37.118
and oil and vinegar and oregano.

34:37.162 --> 34:38.598
It's got everything.

34:40.208 --> 34:42.689
In 1984,
Conza and DeCarlo roll out

34:42.732 --> 34:45.866
the Blimpie Best across
their 300 stores.

34:47.433 --> 34:49.217
They have a
signature sandwich,

34:49.261 --> 34:51.089
an eye catching sandwich

34:51.132 --> 34:54.614
that gives them a critical
degree of success.

34:54.657 --> 34:58.139
It was arguably one of
the largest sandwiches

34:58.183 --> 35:00.054
that anyone had ever seen.

35:00.098 --> 35:02.230
And being that Fred
DeLuca had said

35:02.274 --> 35:05.842
that the Subway sandwich
was a greater value,

35:05.886 --> 35:08.149
it's hard to top a sandwich

35:08.193 --> 35:11.065
that has a full salad's
worth of vegetables

35:11.109 --> 35:14.634
and a full charcuterie board
full of meat on one sandwich.

35:16.026 --> 35:17.289
Sales
of the Blimpie Best

35:17.332 --> 35:19.117
take the nation by storm.

35:19.160 --> 35:23.121
It drives DeCarlo and Conza
to open 370 new stores

35:23.164 --> 35:24.644
in the span of six years

35:25.732 --> 35:27.995
and closes the gap on Subway.

35:29.605 --> 35:30.563
Have you seen this?

35:38.179 --> 35:40.790
Even though Fred DeLuca
is a deeply ambitious guy,

35:40.834 --> 35:44.316
he's not someone to
leap without looking.

35:44.359 --> 35:49.364
He has always used intelligence
to approach any obstacle

35:49.408 --> 35:52.150
that life had set
in front of him.

35:52.193 --> 35:53.673
DeLuca fights back

35:53.716 --> 35:56.632
with his own signature sandwich,
rolling it out nationwide

35:56.676 --> 35:59.679
with an unprecedented
marketing campaign,

35:59.722 --> 36:02.551
aptly named the BMT.

36:02.595 --> 36:05.075
It claims to be the
biggest, meatiest,

36:05.119 --> 36:07.034
tastiest sandwich on the market.

36:10.646 --> 36:13.475
Subway had to
rise to the occasion

36:13.519 --> 36:16.435
and meet and beat
the competition.

36:16.478 --> 36:18.350
The emphasis being on meat.

36:20.178 --> 36:22.267
The sandwich adds
three double portions of meat

36:22.310 --> 36:24.530
and unlimited custom
veggie toppings,

36:24.573 --> 36:27.185
making it bigger than
the Blimpie Best.

36:27.228 --> 36:31.406
It's big, it's delicious,
and it has value.

36:31.450 --> 36:34.540
Three things that American
diners love to this day.

36:36.237 --> 36:38.021
Subway's
new sandwich is a hit,

36:38.065 --> 36:42.243
driving sales to 100
million a year in 1985.

36:42.287 --> 36:45.028
I think that was one
of the great strengths

36:45.072 --> 36:48.380
of the development
of Subway is that

36:48.423 --> 36:50.947
Fred was always a step ahead

36:50.991 --> 36:56.431
of understanding how to
develop and dominate markets.

36:57.563 --> 36:59.565
Subway did that better than
any of the competition.

37:04.265 --> 37:06.093
While DeLuca
and Buck grow Subway

37:06.136 --> 37:09.923
to over 1,800 locations
across the country,

37:09.966 --> 37:12.752
Tony Conza is planning
one last Hail Mary

37:12.795 --> 37:15.407
in the fight for sub dominance,

37:15.450 --> 37:19.498
a move that will take sandwiches
further than ever before.

37:25.678 --> 37:28.507
By 1989, Blimpie is
desperate for a new avenue

37:28.550 --> 37:31.988
to keep up with Subway's
astronomical growth

37:32.032 --> 37:34.643
and Tony Conza has
a revolutionary plan

37:34.687 --> 37:36.950
to accelerate expansion.

37:36.993 --> 37:39.953
If we can shrink down to
a tiny footprint like this,

37:39.996 --> 37:42.608
we can fit a Blimpie
into gas stations.

37:43.609 --> 37:44.523
Gas stations?

37:44.566 --> 37:46.176
Yes.

37:46.220 --> 37:49.354
Hotel lobbies, office
buildings, college campuses.

37:51.051 --> 37:52.357
Blimpie Express.

37:53.880 --> 37:56.839
They've figured out a way,
with minimal real estate,

37:56.883 --> 37:58.493
they can fit their operation,

37:58.537 --> 38:00.060
at least the key elements of it,

38:00.103 --> 38:01.540
into these very small spaces.

38:03.063 --> 38:04.369
With this tiny footprint,

38:04.412 --> 38:06.327
there's almost no
overhead expenses.

38:06.371 --> 38:06.980
Exactly.

38:09.069 --> 38:10.766
This sort of low
cost, low space,

38:10.810 --> 38:14.161
low resource intensive version
of Blimpie, Blimpie Express,

38:14.204 --> 38:16.424
really allows them to grow
and suddenly now they're able

38:16.468 --> 38:19.166
to start expanding
more and more and more.

38:19.209 --> 38:20.907
Let's see Subway
fit one of their ovens

38:20.950 --> 38:21.995
in a space that small.

38:24.824 --> 38:27.348
Conza and DeCarlo
invest all their profits

38:27.392 --> 38:32.266
into launching mini stores
branded as Blimpie Express.

38:32.875 --> 38:35.748
In 1994, they debut
across the country.

38:37.402 --> 38:40.187
So suddenly you could
run into your corner store

38:40.230 --> 38:43.364
where you would pick up milk
or chips or a pack of smokes

38:43.408 --> 38:45.366
and get a sandwich.

38:45.410 --> 38:47.063
Then you could
suddenly get sandwiches

38:47.107 --> 38:48.456
by the side of the highway,

38:48.500 --> 38:50.806
by the side of your
everyday street.

38:50.850 --> 38:53.418
You didn't need to go
into a Blimpie location.

38:53.461 --> 38:56.551
The Blimpie locations
came to you.

38:56.595 --> 38:58.727
It allows 'em to
get into communities

38:58.771 --> 39:01.339
that don't have fast foods
restaurant operations

39:01.382 --> 39:04.385
and it starts to feel like,
oh, now we found a way,

39:04.429 --> 39:06.431
this is sort of our secret
weapon to compete with Subway

39:06.474 --> 39:08.389
and we can really get back
into the game that way

39:08.433 --> 39:10.130
and into the fight.

39:10.173 --> 39:13.438
With startup costs
just $35,000 per location,

39:15.657 --> 39:18.007
the shrewd business
move drives Blimpie

39:18.051 --> 39:23.752
to nearly quadruple in size,
reaching 2,000 stores by 2002

39:24.579 --> 39:27.887
and propelling sales to
over $400 million annually.

39:29.932 --> 39:32.935
Blimpie's express model
is the first of its kind

39:32.979 --> 39:36.199
and inspires chains like
Dunkin' Donuts, Pizza Hut,

39:36.243 --> 39:38.376
and even Subway to follow suit.

39:39.942 --> 39:42.467
But despite the
groundbreaking expansion,

39:42.510 --> 39:45.426
Blimpie falls short
of catching Subway.

39:45.470 --> 39:50.431
So what do you take away
from Blimpie in this war?

39:50.475 --> 39:54.087
Like they lost the war,
but did they really lose?

39:55.958 --> 39:59.440
They've got 2,000 stores in
the country bringing them up

39:59.484 --> 40:03.139
to the upper echelon of fast
food operations in the country.

40:03.183 --> 40:06.055
Tony Conza achieves his dream.

40:06.099 --> 40:09.581
Not only that, Blimpie really
brought America the sub.

40:11.626 --> 40:14.586
Conza and DeCarlo
retire as millionaires,

40:14.629 --> 40:17.415
cementing their legacy in
the fast food industry.

40:21.331 --> 40:24.726
But Subway's relentless
franchising operation brings

40:24.770 --> 40:27.599
the sub sandwich to
every corner of America.

40:33.300 --> 40:36.085
I think that in the
development of Subway

40:36.129 --> 40:40.699
and the explosion of
stores within easy reach

40:40.742 --> 40:43.049
of every home, every office.

40:44.180 --> 40:44.877
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

40:46.487 --> 40:50.230
Convenience is always
a big theme in America

40:50.273 --> 40:53.494
and in how we live our lives.

40:53.538 --> 40:55.453
This is about convenience.

40:55.496 --> 40:59.892
And again, this is about
giving the American worker,

40:59.935 --> 41:02.416
whether blue collar
or white collar,

41:02.460 --> 41:04.984
an option that we
didn't have before.

41:05.941 --> 41:07.595
By 2011,

41:07.639 --> 41:11.512
Subway becomes the world's
largest restaurant chain,

41:11.556 --> 41:15.734
even surpassing McDonald's with
over 40,000 locations today.

41:18.214 --> 41:21.827
Both Pete Buck and Fred
DeLuca retire as billionaires.

41:23.089 --> 41:26.005
At the time of
his death in 2015,

41:26.048 --> 41:30.444
DeLuca's net worth was
estimated at over $3.5 billion,

41:31.880 --> 41:35.101
all born from a deal
made as a teenager

41:35.144 --> 41:36.276
with a family friend.

41:40.410 --> 41:45.067
But just as McDonald's spawned
a lot of hamburger chains,

41:45.111 --> 41:48.201
Subway did that same thing
for the sub sandwich.

41:49.507 --> 41:52.771
All that came about
because Pete Buck said

41:52.814 --> 41:56.078
to this 17 year old kid,
I'll give you $1,000

41:56.122 --> 41:58.298
if you go find a
store and open it

41:58.341 --> 42:00.605
and start selling
sub sandwiches.

42:00.648 --> 42:02.302
Wow.

42:02.345 --> 42:04.347
These were deeply
intelligent men

42:04.391 --> 42:08.656
to whom the submarine
sandwich shop was a problem

42:08.700 --> 42:09.527
to be solved.

42:10.615 --> 42:13.574
It was a brand new thing,

42:13.618 --> 42:17.186
something unlike any
American had seen.

42:17.230 --> 42:21.713
It evoked abundance,
variety, deliciousness,

42:21.756 --> 42:25.717
and that curiosity is what's
propelled this sandwich

42:25.760 --> 42:29.416
that's as long as my arm into
the food folklore of America.
