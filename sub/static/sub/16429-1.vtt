00:33.066 --> 00:35.998
Heavy metal rules.
All that punk shit sucks.

00:36.033 --> 00:40.277
It doesn't belong in this world.
It belongs on fucking Mars, man.

00:40.312 --> 00:44.611
Madonna can go to hell,
as far as I'm concerned. She's a dick.

00:44.946 --> 00:47.202
Seriously, heavy metal... Oh, fuck!

00:47.347 --> 00:49.850
Heavy metal definitely rules.

00:49.885 --> 00:53.121
In 1986,
something strange happened.

00:53.156 --> 00:56.392
Heavy metal became
the most popular music in the world

00:56.427 --> 00:59.427
and kids everywhere
were growing their hair long,

00:59.462 --> 01:01.307
flashing the devil-horn sign

01:01.312 --> 01:03.632
and playing air guitar.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.323
But not everyone loved it.

01:06.333 --> 01:10.641
Critics thought it was unsophisticated
music for unsophisticated people.

01:10.676 --> 01:15.814
One writer went as far as calling it
"sick, repulsive, horrible and dangerous".

01:15.849 --> 01:19.147
Tipper Gore,
wife of America's future vice-president,

01:19.182 --> 01:21.948
led parents in a charge to
censor heavy metal,

01:21.983 --> 01:24.584
resulting in the now-familiar
warning labels.

01:24.619 --> 01:27.587
Cole Porter's
"The birds do it, the bees do it"

01:27.622 --> 01:32.295
can hardly be compared with
W. A. S. P. 's "I F-U-C-K like a beast".

01:32.300 --> 01:35.252
I would tell you it's outrageous filth.

01:35.257 --> 01:38.541
Religious groups launched
their own crusade against heavy metal.

01:38.546 --> 01:40.652
They feared it was a vessel for the devil

01:40.657 --> 01:43.840
and had created a satanic epidemic
among teenagers.

01:43.845 --> 01:45.961
The lyrics is what's become serious

01:45.996 --> 01:49.511
because it glorifies,
glamourises and packages evil.

01:49.546 --> 01:51.716
And then the lawsuits came.

01:51.751 --> 01:56.651
Metal artists were sued for causing kids
to commit suicide or even murder.

01:56.686 --> 02:00.442
Heavy metal was the moral panic
of the day.

02:00.587 --> 02:03.518
And metal fans?
They were considered lowlifes.

02:03.520 --> 02:06.904
Dead-end kids.
The bane of society.

02:07.298 --> 02:11.398
How do I know all of this?
'Cause I was one of them.

02:11.633 --> 02:14.938
My name is Sam Dunn
and this is me in 1986.

02:14.943 --> 02:18.306
Banger. Rocker. Skid.
Call me what you want.

02:18.341 --> 02:20.875
I'm a metalhead and I'm proud.

02:20.910 --> 02:22.951
I grew up in Victoria, BC,

02:22.986 --> 02:26.721
otherwise known as the land
of the newlywed and the nearly dead.

02:26.756 --> 02:29.517
A quaint town on Canada's western edge.

02:29.552 --> 02:33.189
The last place on Earth you'd ever expect
someone to find metal.

02:33.194 --> 02:36.981
But I did, and I entered a whole new world.

02:45.965 --> 02:49.030
Iron Maiden, Motley Crue, Van Halen.

02:49.101 --> 02:52.239
This was the metal
that I first fell in love with.

02:52.274 --> 02:55.844
I listened to Number of the Beast
25 times in one day

02:55.879 --> 02:59.214
while doing air-guitar leaps
off my front porch.

02:59.249 --> 03:02.205
I so wanted to be in Iron Maiden

03:02.382 --> 03:07.920
But by age 13 I needed something,
well... a little heavier.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.835
I discovered extreme metal.

03:18.840 --> 03:22.782
Beneath the Remains, Altars of Madness,
Pleasure to Kill

03:22.787 --> 03:26.579
These were some of the fastest
and most brutal albums that I could find.

03:26.584 --> 03:28.811
Soon I was playing in my own metal band,

03:28.816 --> 03:31.509
hosting my own radio show, Overkill

03:31.511 --> 03:35.574
and going to every extreme metal gig
that came to town.

03:39.456 --> 03:42.025
At 19 I went to university,

03:42.030 --> 03:44.826
and since Metal Studies
wasn't on the curriculum,

03:44.861 --> 03:47.667
I decided to major in anthropology.

03:47.702 --> 03:50.366
Anthropology is the study
of human cultures,

03:50.401 --> 03:55.213
and I loved it because I got to explore
societies vastly different than my own.

03:55.248 --> 03:58.470
For my graduate degree,
I travelled to Central America

03:58.505 --> 04:02.472
and wrote my thesis on the struggles
of Guatemalan refugees.

04:03.075 --> 04:06.767
There's always been one culture
I've really wanted to study.

04:06.772 --> 04:08.604
Heavy metal.

04:08.681 --> 04:12.387
This music has millions
of passionate fans worldwide,

04:12.392 --> 04:18.630
yet for 35 years it's been consistently
stereotyped, dismissed and condemned.

04:18.635 --> 04:22.658
I know. I've been defending it
since I was 12 years old.

04:23.500 --> 04:26.966
Why has metal provoked
such polar reactions?

04:27.001 --> 04:29.799
I need to answer this question.

04:29.969 --> 04:32.273
So, this is my journey.

04:32.308 --> 04:35.930
I'm going to take you
into the world of heavy metal.

06:09.536 --> 06:13.041
Before I get into
how metal has divided people,

06:13.076 --> 06:16.579
I want to explore a subject
that has long divided metalheads.

06:16.614 --> 06:19.449
Who gets to be called
the first heavy-metal band?

06:19.484 --> 06:21.986
This debate has been going on
for decades.

06:22.021 --> 06:25.748
So, this seems like the best place
to start my journey.

06:32.558 --> 06:35.501
Origins

06:35.511 --> 06:36.990
History of Heavy Metal

06:37.025 --> 06:38.955
Early Metal

07:00.954 --> 07:06.894
If you wanna go back to the early metal
bands, you have to look at Blue Cheer.

07:06.929 --> 07:10.132
Nobody talks about them very often,

07:10.167 --> 07:11.800
but they were, at one point

07:11.835 --> 07:15.235
the loudest, most metallic trio going.

07:15.270 --> 07:19.101
Heavy metal is, of course,
in the lyrics of Born To Be Wild,

07:19.136 --> 07:23.812
which was written by a Canadian,
Dennis Edmonton, Mars Bonfire.

07:23.847 --> 07:27.748
He was really talking about
that whole experience of...

07:27.783 --> 07:30.821
you know, big bikes
and roaring down the highway...

07:30.856 --> 07:34.621
For me, my awareness of it
came with Led Zeppelin.

07:34.656 --> 07:39.292
As soon as those guys launched, people
started using the term "heavy metal".

07:39.327 --> 07:43.029
I knew instantly that that sound
was heavy something.

07:43.064 --> 07:46.065
As it is today, probably Deep Purple...

07:46.100 --> 07:50.492
you know, 'cause they were the first
to have this great big fuck-off PA...

07:50.527 --> 07:53.517
and, erm... the first to have
a lot of pyrotechnics.

07:53.552 --> 07:56.611
Actually, the first time "heavy metal"
was ever used...

07:56.646 --> 07:59.640
was used... about Alice Cooper.

07:59.679 --> 08:01.146
In Rolling Stone magazine

08:01.148 --> 08:06.621
Rolling Stone magazine was doing an interview
with us in '71, '72, '73, something like that.

08:06.656 --> 08:09.122
There was a photo of a guy holding me up

08:09.157 --> 08:12.916
and it said,
"Da-da-da...It's heavy metal".

08:12.951 --> 08:15.539
Every metal band owes a debt,
musically, to Black Sabbath.

08:15.574 --> 08:17.267
They were the original.

08:17.302 --> 08:19.741
Indeed. First metal band ever.
Black Sabbath.

08:19.776 --> 08:23.936
Every cool riff has already been written
by Black Sabbath.

08:23.971 --> 08:27.475
Anything anyone else does
is just basically ripping it off.

08:27.510 --> 08:31.012
Either you're playing it slightly different,
or fast or slow, but...

08:31.047 --> 08:32.880
They did everything already.

08:32.914 --> 08:37.506
For my money, Black Sabbath
reigns as the first heavy-metal band.

08:37.650 --> 08:41.609
It was here on the gritty streets
of Birmingham, England, in 1970,

08:41.644 --> 08:46.186
where Sabbath took music to a darker...
more sinister place.

08:46.325 --> 08:49.663
Most people associate Black Sabbath
with Ozzy Osbourne,

08:49.698 --> 08:52.268
now known as a reality-TV dad,

08:52.273 --> 08:55.139
but it was Tony lommi, Sabbath's guitarist,

08:55.174 --> 08:57.807
who was responsible
for creating the band's sound

08:57.842 --> 09:01.042
and the first true heavy-metal riffs.

09:01.047 --> 09:05.311
When I first heard of "heavy metal"
I had no idea what it was.

09:05.346 --> 09:07.083
This was many years ago.

09:07.088 --> 09:10.586
I was doing an interview and somebody
said, "About this heavy metal... "

09:10.621 --> 09:12.857
"What's that?"

09:12.892 --> 09:16.022
I just came up with a sort of music
that everybody liked

09:16.057 --> 09:19.260
when we first started writing riffs.

09:19.295 --> 09:22.862
And then Black Sabbath... And
Black Sabbath seemed so different.

09:22.867 --> 09:26.138
Those few notes, you know,
that sort of said it all.

09:26.173 --> 09:28.877
I thought, "God, this is great!"

09:28.912 --> 09:31.904
We loved it. We loved the vibe.
You know, hairs come up on your arm.

09:31.939 --> 09:37.914
It just gave us a great feeling of...
"This is what we're about!"

09:37.949 --> 09:43.663
The sound being, you know, demonic,
it sort of... It just appealed to us.

09:43.698 --> 09:46.087
It appealed to the...
We liked what we were doing.

09:46.122 --> 09:51.346
We liked the idea of those
evilly sort of sounding riffs.

09:51.627 --> 09:54.757
THE SOUND

10:04.240 --> 10:05.646
Since Black Sabbath,

10:05.648 --> 10:09.609
the sound of evil has become a
defining element of heavy metal.

10:09.644 --> 10:12.048
But what makes metal sound evil?

10:12.053 --> 10:15.081
The blues scale has the flat fifth,
the tritone.

10:15.086 --> 10:16.290
That's the devil's note.

10:16.295 --> 10:19.187
In the old days,
you weren't allowed to use that note.

10:19.222 --> 10:21.821
But Black Sabbath,  their title song...

10:21.856 --> 10:26.427
Black Sabbath is totally working
the diminished fifth. The tritone.

10:26.462 --> 10:32.435
In the Middle Ages, the tritone was identified
as the music of the devil because it...

10:32.470 --> 10:37.606
apparently was the sound
one used to call up the Beast.

10:37.641 --> 10:40.876
There's something very sexual
about the sound of the tritone.

10:40.881 --> 10:44.216
I think that in the Middle Ages,
people who were ignorant and scared,

10:44.251 --> 10:47.246
when they heard something like that and felt
that reaction inside their bodies went,

10:47.281 --> 10:49.604
"Oh, here comes the devil!"

10:51.185 --> 10:53.152
There's an ongoing battle
in heavy metal

10:53.157 --> 10:56.157
to be more evil than the band
that came before you.

10:56.162 --> 10:58.926
This has kept me into metal
all these years.

10:58.961 --> 11:01.697
But there's more to this music
than just sounding evil.

11:01.732 --> 11:09.603
If you don't have an electric guitar with
really good amps and really good distortion,

11:09.638 --> 11:12.878
you don't have the core of metal.

11:12.913 --> 11:18.111
You also need to have
a really strong bass sound in it.

11:18.146 --> 11:21.717
Bass with the bass guitarist
and bass with the bass drums.

11:21.722 --> 11:26.055
And then usually a vocalist who soared
over top of all of that stuff,

11:26.060 --> 11:28.054
with usually a fairly high voice.

11:28.089 --> 11:33.353
They can't be soft, cute, sly.

11:33.626 --> 11:37.557
Um... they have to be leather-lunged
in one way or another.

12:15.234 --> 12:19.238
Back when I was a kid, practising
air-guitar leaps off my front porch,

12:19.273 --> 12:21.708
my band of choice was Iron Maiden.

12:21.743 --> 12:26.080
I memorised every note, every riff,
and every solo.

12:26.085 --> 12:28.891
Maiden was part of the new wave
of British heavy metal,

12:28.896 --> 12:32.790
a movement that built on the foundation
laid by early metal bands.

12:32.825 --> 12:35.672
They honed a sound
that was faster, heavier

12:35.707 --> 12:38.524
and more melodic
than their predecessors'.

12:38.624 --> 12:43.099
Now I'm on my way to interview Maiden's
legendary singer Bruce Dickinson,

12:43.101 --> 12:47.432
and if the 12-year-old Sam
knew about this, he'd be freaking out.

12:47.436 --> 12:50.295
But I've got to keep it together,
even though I'm interviewing him

12:50.330 --> 12:53.909
on stage of the famous London venue,
the Hammersmith Odeon.

12:53.944 --> 12:55.377
- I'd better start talking, then.

12:55.412 --> 12:57.150
My intention as a front man

12:57.185 --> 13:02.047
is to try and find the guy who's right
at the back of the 30,000 festival

13:02.049 --> 13:04.708
and sort of go, "Yeah, you!"

13:05.463 --> 13:07.323
"Yeah, you! You!"

13:07.358 --> 13:10.562
And the guy goes, "Me?"
Like that.

13:10.597 --> 13:13.255
And you can do that.
You can actually do that.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.944
With heavy metal it doesn't even matter,
the microphone is there,

13:38.979 --> 13:42.456
but you've got the sound like you're
projecting to the back of the hall.

13:42.491 --> 13:44.724
Like there's a tremendous effort involved.

13:44.759 --> 13:46.427
And so you get the return,

13:46.462 --> 13:49.584
in I think particulary people like
Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden,

13:49.619 --> 13:51.367
or Rob Halford of Judas Priest,

13:51.402 --> 13:54.635
of this very operatic style
of vocal production,

13:54.670 --> 13:58.671
that was developed in the 19th century,
before amplification,

13:58.706 --> 14:00.510
in order to reach the back of the hall.

14:00.515 --> 14:02.512
You're warming up the whole crowd,

14:02.517 --> 14:04.977
and on a good night, when it all works,

14:05.012 --> 14:08.004
it shrinks... whatever arena you're in

14:08.039 --> 14:10.567
and it should, by the end of the...
Me in particular, 'cause

14:10.572 --> 14:13.354
I'm the guy usually yelling at
everybody and running arround

14:13.359 --> 14:17.637
It should feel like you've shrunk
the place to the size of your thumb,

14:17.639 --> 14:20.754
where you can go,
"Yeah... altogether. "

14:27.935 --> 14:33.482
Dickinson's operatic vocal style has had an
enormous impact on heavy metal music

14:33.517 --> 14:35.421
and although people dont
assosiated metal

14:35.423 --> 14:39.488
with virtuosic styles of music
like classical or opera,

14:39.795 --> 14:42.618
it's these influences
that make metal unique.

14:42.653 --> 14:44.684
MUSICAL ROOTS

14:44.719 --> 14:47.991
The classical roots of heavy metal
are fairly obvious.

14:47.996 --> 14:52.326
I would say most of the practitioners,
most of the really good ones,

14:52.361 --> 14:56.985
were fans of dark classical music.

14:57.020 --> 15:01.969
And in some cases dark, powerful,
heavy classical music, like Wagner.

15:02.004 --> 15:04.340
He actually reshaped the orchestra.

15:04.375 --> 15:08.881
He added tubas, he added extra basses,
he added an octobass,

15:08.916 --> 15:12.112
which is actually a double-sized
bass violin

15:12.147 --> 15:14.148
that two people to play,

15:14.183 --> 15:16.995
one guy on a stool fingering it,

15:17.030 --> 15:19.418
and one guy, you know, playing the bow.

15:19.453 --> 15:22.508
He just loaded down the bottom end
of his orchestra,

15:22.543 --> 15:25.847
so that when that orchestra
played the rafters shook,

15:25.882 --> 15:27.893
there was so much bass.

15:27.928 --> 15:30.162
It was the first time anybody
really heard that live.

15:30.197 --> 15:33.834
If Richard Wagner had actually
been around today

15:33.869 --> 15:35.672
he'd probably be in Deep Purple.

15:35.707 --> 15:39.769
Or Beethoven would've been happy
to be in Led Zeppelin.

15:48.614 --> 15:51.284
And the music itself,
because it was so huge,

15:51.319 --> 15:54.620
and there was no amplification then,
they had orchestration,

15:54.655 --> 15:57.426
I think, again belongs to that
metal environment.

15:57.431 --> 16:01.295
Classical music is associated
with the university and learning.

16:01.300 --> 16:03.530
Bach and Mozart didn't go to college.

16:03.535 --> 16:07.039
Virtuosic performers
who were known as improvisers.

16:07.074 --> 16:10.958
That describes Bach as well as it
describes Eddie Van Halen.

16:47.306 --> 16:51.545
From Eddie Van Halen on,
the guitar becomes so overdriven, so hot,

16:51.550 --> 16:56.082
that the models of playing for the violin
and organ become relevant to the guitar,

16:56.117 --> 16:59.553
which used to be like piano,
where you'd hit a note and it would fade.

16:59.588 --> 17:03.392
Not any longer. A note couldn't last forever
because it's feeding back.

17:03.427 --> 17:07.310
Suddenly, you have the classical models
being relevant

17:07.316 --> 17:09.983
because of technological changes.

17:19.310 --> 17:22.243
Of course, heavy metal
has another musical ancestor.

17:22.249 --> 17:25.441
One whose roots lie deep
in the American South.

17:25.582 --> 17:28.937
The root of all rock and roll is...

17:28.972 --> 17:33.219
is in blues and slave music.

17:33.254 --> 17:35.941
I mean, they invented...
The guitar is an African instrument.

17:35.976 --> 17:37.958
That's where it started.

17:37.963 --> 17:41.465
The origins of metal really can
trace itself back to the blues.

17:41.500 --> 17:45.032
in America. And that, of course,
is very much an oppressed music

17:45.067 --> 17:48.947
and it very much spoke to people that
needed something a little different.

17:48.982 --> 17:51.383
It was about the worker
coming out of the factory

17:51.418 --> 17:54.204
wanting the energy to come out
in a different way,

17:54.239 --> 17:57.777
in an entertainment form
that was theirs and theirs alone.

17:57.812 --> 18:00.483
How were you influenced
by the blues?

18:00.518 --> 18:04.017
A lot. I liked blues.
That's where we started.

18:04.052 --> 18:07.952
were actually before we called
ourselves Black Sabbath,

18:07.987 --> 18:11.659
we were a blues, jazz band.

18:11.694 --> 18:16.565
Our first influence
was really American blues

18:16.570 --> 18:23.466
that had been processed through the
sensibilities of the English rock musician.

18:24.504 --> 18:27.929
They took American blues
and threw it back at us.

18:46.294 --> 18:50.597
ENVIRONMENTS

18:50.602 --> 18:52.030
If you look at the history
of Black Sabbath,

18:52.035 --> 18:54.967
and even Deep Purple and
certainly Led Zeppelin,

18:54.972 --> 18:57.074
they people weren't come from
affluent backgrounds,

18:57.109 --> 19:00.074
and therefore they grew up and knew
exactly how to present their music,

19:00.109 --> 19:03.310
to people who came from a
like-minded situation.

19:03.345 --> 19:06.111
Describe Aston to me.

19:06.146 --> 19:09.211
A shit-hole, basically. Erm...

19:09.618 --> 19:12.753
Very rough, very... Not a good area.

19:12.788 --> 19:17.883
Some of the people were nice.
It just... got run down, you know.

19:19.425 --> 19:23.430
And I hated it, living there. I hated it.

19:23.465 --> 19:26.305
At first. I moved there with my parents.

19:26.340 --> 19:29.527
And I think that influenced
our music, as far as

19:29.562 --> 19:34.711
where we come from and the area we
were from made it sort of more mean.

19:34.746 --> 19:40.177
The place where we're from,
there's a lot of big factories over there.

19:40.182 --> 19:43.889
Like heavy metal factories.
They're all there, you know.

19:43.924 --> 19:49.088
So, they're like aluminium and... steel, too.

19:49.123 --> 19:52.958
And you can see the impact
around the environment.

19:52.993 --> 19:55.126
And also on the people too, you know.

19:55.161 --> 19:59.331
Places are shut down and
some of the places built up.

19:59.366 --> 20:03.204
You can see a lot of things on people
and it's not always nice.

20:03.209 --> 20:08.966
The thing to do in the evenings was
to go and hang out around the phone box.

20:09.274 --> 20:13.043
'Cause that was the only light source
in the whole village.

20:13.378 --> 20:18.352
And it was in the middle, so we used to
hang around and swap dirty stories.

20:18.387 --> 20:21.525
If there was any luckless women
walking past, you know...

20:21.560 --> 20:23.657
it was just fucking hopeless.

20:23.692 --> 20:26.264
But that's like any small town
in any nation.

20:26.299 --> 20:29.096
It comes from growing up
in a place like Des Moines.

20:29.131 --> 20:35.070
More people grow up in places like that
than you'll ever, ever imagine.

20:35.105 --> 20:36.685
I mean the disaffected.

20:36.687 --> 20:41.807
It's a... it's a place where
churches outnumber everything.

20:41.842 --> 20:47.448
It's a place where you grow up in the cemetery because
it's the only place that really has anything to do.

20:47.483 --> 20:51.850
It's a place where your friends would rather
kill themselves than use their imagination.

20:51.885 --> 20:56.957
There's nothing arround you, so you have to
grow this whole other world in your head.

20:56.992 --> 20:59.591
That really makes for strong personalities

20:59.596 --> 21:04.864
and that's why a lot of people from lowa
are probably the sickest I've ever seen.

21:04.899 --> 21:07.366
On Saturday night...

21:07.601 --> 21:09.865
- You know, you hear guns.
-  "Pow! Pow! Pow!"

21:10.702 --> 21:12.671
You just hear 'em and...

21:12.706 --> 21:15.816
It's not even really a
"What's that? Was that a gun?"

21:15.851 --> 21:18.847
It's like "They're shooting again.
It's Saturday night. "

21:18.882 --> 21:21.980
So, that inevitably becomes
part of what Lamb of God is about.

21:22.015 --> 21:26.111
- It becomes part of the landscape.
- It was part of your psyche.

21:26.353 --> 21:29.709
Kids are bored, agitated,

21:30.155 --> 21:33.327
you know, especially if they have
problems at home.

21:33.362 --> 21:36.803
Parents, drug addiction, alcoholism.

21:36.838 --> 21:39.662
It all contributes to a...

21:41.066 --> 21:48.531
you know, the product
of a young, angry musician.

21:49.076 --> 21:54.241
It's a negation of the world
as it's handed to you.

21:54.346 --> 21:58.716
It just says, to this daily existence
of this boring-ass high school

21:58.751 --> 22:01.208
or this dead-end Dairy Queen job,

22:01.243 --> 22:03.942
"Just no! This is something that's mine,
and that I own,"

22:03.977 --> 22:06.846
and "Fuck you I won't do what you tell me. "

22:38.862 --> 22:41.945
THE FANS

22:41.950 --> 22:45.697
I'm 13 years old, 14 on Halloween,
which I'm proud of,

22:45.732 --> 22:48.239
and I grew up in a small town in Quebec

22:48.274 --> 22:52.439
where everyone likes Shania Twain
and Avril Lavigne, so...

22:52.474 --> 22:55.468
I've changed a lot over the
last couple of years.

22:55.640 --> 22:59.049
They were like
"What happened to you?"

22:59.084 --> 23:01.782
- Satan has arrived.
-  Is it a statement for you?

23:01.817 --> 23:05.719
Yeah. There is a statement in it.
It's "Fuck you!"

23:05.754 --> 23:12.432
A lot of people in my town
would rather I wear jeans or whatever.

23:12.467 --> 23:14.395
Wal-Mart stuff.

23:14.430 --> 23:18.832
But I choose not to and people
are gonna have to deal with that.

23:18.867 --> 23:23.038
Metalheads, a lot of them,
if you do say something to them,

23:23.073 --> 23:27.205
they have their own opinions and they can talk to
you about it and be like, "Ok, this is what I think."

23:27.240 --> 23:31.110
Don't try to like the same music
because your friend likes it.

23:31.115 --> 23:35.247
Don't try to listen
to whatever's popular so you'll fit in.

23:35.282 --> 23:39.003
That's what you find in metal, you find
self-confidence 'cause it's a strong type of music

23:39.038 --> 23:43.659
that gives you the ability to say
"OK, screw you!

23:43.694 --> 23:47.094
"I like this band. If you don't like it, too bad.
Don't buy the album, don't listen to it. "

23:47.129 --> 23:50.262
My name's Joe Bottiglieri.
I'm, 34 years old.

23:50.297 --> 23:54.569
I was born in White Plains, New York.
I'm an ex-Marine. Once a Marine, always a Marine.

23:54.574 --> 23:59.005
I'm currently a director of technology
for a firm in New York City

23:59.040 --> 24:00.839
and I'm a diehard metal fan.

24:00.844 --> 24:04.476
It was there for a lot of
dark times in my life.

24:04.511 --> 24:08.046
From the time I was 12 years old,
metal was just a constant

24:08.081 --> 24:11.518
and a lot of the lyrics spoke to me
on a personal level

24:11.553 --> 24:15.422
about sticking to your guns
and staying true to what you believe in.

24:15.427 --> 24:17.289
It's like a lifestyle music.

24:17.324 --> 24:20.929
Everything else is like "I like it,
I like it for a week, I lose interest",

24:20.964 --> 24:24.629
but metal fans love it forever.

24:24.664 --> 24:26.351
I guess what a...
I'm not a casual person.

24:26.353 --> 24:30.437
When I like something, it's like real
and it's not casual music.

24:30.472 --> 24:34.677
Like no one goes "Yeah,
I was really big into Slayer. One summer. "

24:34.712 --> 24:37.844
You know, I never met that guy.

24:37.879 --> 24:41.214
I've only met the guy with Slayer
carved across his chest.

24:41.249 --> 24:43.673
No main veins. That's good.

24:44.115 --> 24:45.967
No arterial spray.

24:46.002 --> 24:50.440
If you listen to, like, the Replacements
or the Smiths when you're young,

24:50.475 --> 24:54.526
it sort of says, "Well you feel weird and you feel
different but that's 'cause you're smart."

24:54.531 --> 24:58.563
You are different but you
should be happy with that.

24:58.598 --> 25:03.504
But metal really seemed to tell people
that you feel weird but you're not.

25:03.539 --> 25:07.105
That's why I was so interested
in the idea of the Kiss Army.

25:07.110 --> 25:09.446
It was this idea that if you liked Kiss,

25:09.481 --> 25:14.143
that means that you're part
of this massive coven of people

25:14.178 --> 25:16.784
who have, like, the same values you have.

25:16.819 --> 25:22.623
Kiss songs always seem to imply that as Kiss fans
we're being somewhat persecuted for it.

25:22.628 --> 25:24.508
Like if you listen to the songs Crazy Nights

25:24.543 --> 25:28.662
it somehow implies people are trying
to stop us from liking Kiss!

25:28.697 --> 25:32.744
I think that's a really brilliant idea and
I think that's part of the draw to metal.

25:32.749 --> 25:34.141
It makes people feel like...

25:34.143 --> 25:38.202
it's not a way to understand
your loneliness.

25:38.205 --> 25:42.177
It's sort of a way to feel that you are a part
of something larger than yourself,

25:42.182 --> 25:44.967
because everything about metal
is larger than in this life.

25:44.972 --> 25:47.312
It gives them an alternative universe.

25:47.314 --> 25:52.319
It gives them a life of imagination
through which they can view music.

25:52.354 --> 25:56.645
It usually inspires a lot of them
to pick up a guitar and start playing.

26:06.200 --> 26:09.873
I'm Eric Bryan. I'm 17.
I'm from Riverside, California.

26:09.875 --> 26:11.670
I'm a bass player.

26:11.672 --> 26:14.142
-  You're also a student?
- I'm a student. Yeah.

26:14.177 --> 26:17.376
- Metal in particularly does something for you.
- Yeah.

26:17.411 --> 26:19.181
- What do you think that is?

26:19.216 --> 26:22.597
I couldn't get into other styles.
I just can't related to it.

26:22.632 --> 26:26.285
No matter how much I listened to it,
rap wasn't doing anything for me.

26:26.320 --> 26:30.143
I can relate to metal,
maybe because it's a little more angry.

26:30.178 --> 26:35.060
Something that you have to dig into
to define has always interested me.

26:35.095 --> 26:37.963
Because some things you scratch
the surface and there it is,

26:37.998 --> 26:42.200
but with metal
there's so many meanings to it.

26:42.235 --> 26:46.308
Whether they be religious or just in life,
there's something for everyone.

26:46.343 --> 26:47.998
Why is music so important to you?

26:48.000 --> 26:51.744
It's something that I can always count on.

26:51.779 --> 26:56.516
I mean things in life they tend like it's a roller-coaster,
Whether you've had a good day or a bad day

26:56.551 --> 27:00.201
Whether you've had a good day
or a bad day

27:00.236 --> 27:03.922
the music's gonna be there,
and that's been very important.

27:03.957 --> 27:08.522
It really gets inside
the mind of an eternal 15-year-old.

27:08.727 --> 27:13.198
If you ever lose that 15-year-old kid
inside of you,

27:13.233 --> 27:16.706
then it won't make any sense at all
and people will start saying,

27:16.741 --> 27:22.747
"That was the part of my life
I'm really embarrassed about it now.

27:22.782 --> 27:27.006
"I wore those stupid trousers
and had that long hair. "

27:27.846 --> 27:33.987
People are somehow ashamed of what
they were like when they were a kid.

27:34.022 --> 27:36.488
I still have people asking me nowadays,

27:36.523 --> 27:40.298
"Aren't you ever going to
outgrow that shit?"

27:40.333 --> 27:45.363
I'm like "Fuck you!" I wear these shirts 'cause
I like them, not because it's fucking popular.

27:45.398 --> 27:49.534
I'm who I am and if...
if that makes me a fuckin' dork,

27:49.569 --> 27:54.941
or I'm not GQ or I'm not in vogue.
I really couldn't fuckin' give two shits.

27:54.976 --> 27:57.913
It's outsider music and
it's a outsider subjects

27:57.915 --> 28:01.918
and as a kid I was an outsider and
the loner and I think that,

28:01.920 --> 28:03.322
that's where it all begins.

28:03.324 --> 28:04.953
You just sort of getting
obsessed with a weird stuff

28:04.988 --> 28:08.557
You don't care about baseball,
you're obsessed with the Manson Family.

28:08.562 --> 28:11.491
Not 'cause it's cool,
'cause it doesn't appear to be cool,

28:11.526 --> 28:14.798
'cause it's making you look like the weird kid.
And nobody like going out and...

28:14.800 --> 28:18.006
Nobody wants to be the weird kid,
you just somehow end up being a weird kid

28:18.008 --> 28:20.490
and you can't figure out
how you got there.

28:20.632 --> 28:26.098
Metal is sort of like that, except it's like
all the weird kids in one place.

28:26.675 --> 28:29.620
CULTURE

28:50.432 --> 28:53.432
I'm on my way
to Wacken Open Air...

28:53.467 --> 28:56.252
the Mecca of heavy-metal culture.

28:56.287 --> 29:01.394
This is where 40,000 diehard fans descend
on a small town in northern Germany

29:01.429 --> 29:05.981
for four days of beer,
debauchery and heavy metal.

29:06.016 --> 29:10.682
But it's 2am, we've no passes
and none of us speak a word of German...

29:10.717 --> 29:14.967
We're gonna stay.
We're gonna sleep. In the lot.

29:15.002 --> 29:16.862
but with the power of charades, we
track down the organiser Thomas Jensen.

29:16.897 --> 29:21.126
we manage to track down
the organiser Thomas Jensen.

29:21.131 --> 29:24.199
He gives us our passes
and a bit of a hard time.

29:24.234 --> 29:26.061
Are you fuckin' crazy or what?

29:26.066 --> 29:28.698
- Sam Dunn.
- In the middle of the night!

29:29.471 --> 29:34.274
- We had a very, very long hard day.
We lost some of our bags.

29:34.309 --> 29:35.874
- Surprise, surprise.

29:35.909 --> 29:37.779
These are the festival grounds.

29:37.814 --> 29:41.116
Tomorrow, this place will come alive
with metalheads,

29:41.121 --> 29:43.348
here to worship their metal gods.

29:43.383 --> 29:46.944
I'm in heaven. I'm in fuckin' heaven!

30:14.014 --> 30:16.812
... from Italy.
-  Where are you guys from?

30:17.714 --> 30:19.515
- From Italy?
- From Italy, yeah.

30:19.550 --> 30:21.280
- Salute.
-  Salute.

30:48.086 --> 30:51.284
It's the morning of the first full day
of music at Wacken.

30:51.319 --> 30:55.942
Already... the vast majority of fans
are totally hung-over.

30:57.994 --> 31:00.017
Including me.

31:00.427 --> 31:02.903
I'm looking pretty rough.
Don't get to tight

31:02.938 --> 31:05.045
Cut me some slack here.-

31:07.000 --> 31:09.602
Wacken is about
more than just the music.

31:09.637 --> 31:12.806
It is a veritable feast of everything metal.

31:12.841 --> 31:15.073
Here you can find the metal market,

31:15.108 --> 31:18.174
metal breakfast, metal karaoke...

31:18.209 --> 31:20.883
You can even play a game
of heavy-metal foosball.

31:20.918 --> 31:23.180
Sweet. Can I play?

31:24.451 --> 31:27.017
-  Who's that?
-  I want Dio.

31:27.185 --> 31:31.128
There should be, like,
black metal versus death metal.

31:31.163 --> 31:36.161
Fans travel tens of thousands of miles
from over 20 countries to be at Wacken.

31:36.196 --> 31:41.673
As an anthropologist, I'm here to explore
the elements that unify this group of fans.

31:41.708 --> 31:45.405
One thing about festivals is, you
can come here and get anything you want.

31:45.440 --> 31:48.743
Get your band shirts. Get everything.

31:48.778 --> 31:51.732
This is the look, the image...
This is the uniform.

31:51.767 --> 31:54.818
What makes metal a culture
is firstly the music.

31:54.820 --> 31:56.721
No question about it. Secondly...

31:56.756 --> 31:59.453
uniform is the wrong word,
but the way you dress.

31:59.488 --> 32:03.023
People dressing a certain way it marks
you immediately as a metal fan.

32:03.028 --> 32:08.294
Black is really important.
Leather is really important.

32:08.329 --> 32:13.535
Silver is good, you know, in studs.
It's not real silver, it's nickel.

32:13.540 --> 32:16.928
Black in Western culture in general
is a very interesting thing.

32:16.963 --> 32:20.960
It means of danger,
it means evil.

32:20.995 --> 32:23.043
Buat it also again, a freedom.

32:23.048 --> 32:27.914
Outside of the light of day,
where people are not watching you.

32:27.949 --> 32:30.383
The kids who liked metal
looked like they like metal

32:30.418 --> 32:31.688
Now it's a little different...

32:31.723 --> 32:35.088
Everyone had long hair, everyone was in black,
everyone had tattoos.

32:35.123 --> 32:38.947
It was just funny.
It was like... an army of kids.

32:39.259 --> 32:42.932
Metal is unified by much more
than the way the fans dress.

32:42.967 --> 32:46.800
Because mainstream support has come
and gone over the past 35 years,

32:46.835 --> 32:50.236
metal is kept alive by
a dedicated core of fans.

32:50.271 --> 32:54.294
They are the ones who publish magazines,
programme college radio shows,

32:54.329 --> 32:58.845
run independent record labels and host news
sites and chatrooms on the internet.

32:58.880 --> 33:01.814
The underground
is just a network of friends.

33:01.849 --> 33:04.051
Just everyone who's participating.

33:04.056 --> 33:06.518
Other people help printing up T-shirts,

33:06.553 --> 33:09.954
another one is driving,
another kid is helping out his friends

33:09.989 --> 33:13.522
by coming along helping them
load and unload the van.

33:13.557 --> 33:15.463
Sell the T-shirt. It's a community.

33:15.498 --> 33:19.592
Yeah? You know Goddess of Desire?
We have three CDs out.

33:19.627 --> 33:23.864
Also on vinyl, of course. True metal.

33:26.337 --> 33:29.043
Metal, for me, is a brotherhood.

33:29.078 --> 33:31.048
I think that's what keeps it alive.

33:31.083 --> 33:34.986
We pass it on to our younger brothers,
we pass it on to our friends.

33:35.021 --> 33:37.582
This is a way of life.
When I wake up,

33:37.617 --> 33:40.155
I've got Slayer on the stereo.
Before I do anything

33:40.160 --> 33:42.222
You know, some people wake up they
read a paper, they drink a coffee.

33:42.257 --> 33:44.655
I listen to Slayer,
I listen to Testament.

33:45.456 --> 33:48.461
It's... it's... it's in your blood.
It's the air that you breathe.

33:48.496 --> 33:50.728
It's a sub-strata of society,

33:50.763 --> 33:55.034
because what attracts heavy-metal fans
to themselves is a tribal attitude.

33:55.069 --> 33:57.902
It's "Let's go to a festival and
let's enjoy ourselves. "

33:57.907 --> 34:01.706
The fact that the outside world doesn't
actualy understand is fantastic.

34:01.741 --> 34:06.381
Another thing that I love
is that it's so fucking huge,

34:06.416 --> 34:09.570
yet it's like certain people
don't even know it exists.

34:54.626 --> 34:57.695
That was amazing!
They're one of my favourite bands.

34:57.730 --> 35:01.467
To see them in front of 40,000 people
was a dream come true.

35:01.502 --> 35:04.837
-  Was it?
- Best show I've ever seen. I was in the pit.

35:04.872 --> 35:08.535
That was fucking awesome.
That was fucking awesome.

35:09.073 --> 35:11.804
Wacken hosts a wide range
of metal bands.

35:11.839 --> 35:17.252
For the outsider, it's hard to understand
how all these fall under the same umbrella.

35:17.287 --> 35:20.507
Even for the diehard metal fan
this gets complex,

35:20.542 --> 35:22.881
so you might wanna take notes.

35:23.123 --> 35:27.360
The early metal bands, along with
hard rock, shock rock and punk,

35:27.395 --> 35:29.969
gave birth to an abundance of sub-genres,

35:29.974 --> 35:33.366
each with their own distinct
sound, lyrics and look.

35:33.401 --> 35:37.410
These are power metal,
the new wave of British heavy metal,

35:37.445 --> 35:40.538
progressive metal,
glam metal, pop metal,

35:40.573 --> 35:43.580
stoner metal, hardcore,
thrash metal,

35:43.585 --> 35:46.679
the first wave of black metal,
Norwegian black metal,

35:46.684 --> 35:49.450
grindcore, death metal,
Swedish death metal,

35:49.455 --> 35:52.817
metalcore, grunge,
goth metal, industrial metal,

35:52.822 --> 35:55.093
hard alternative,
new metal,

35:55.098 --> 35:57.611
and the new wave of
American metal.

35:57.761 --> 36:01.059
But don't worry.
I'm at Wacken to focus on the fans.

36:01.094 --> 36:04.197
Not to meet with bands
from every metal sub-genre.

36:04.202 --> 36:08.254
There are a couple of bands though that
I can't resist the opportunity to meet.

36:08.259 --> 36:09.466
We're at the gate.

36:09.472 --> 36:13.438
Our interview's with Mayhem.
We're by the beer tents. Meet us there.

36:13.473 --> 36:17.074
My first interview is with the
Norwegian black metal band Mayhem,

36:17.079 --> 36:20.146
the most controversial group
in the metal underground.

36:20.181 --> 36:23.810
The band's former vocalist blew
his own brains out with a shotgun

36:23.815 --> 36:27.418
and then his bandmates made
necklaces from pieces of his skull.

36:27.453 --> 36:31.349
Warning:
This interview gets a little weird.

36:31.526 --> 36:33.717
The History of Metal. Mark it.

36:33.992 --> 36:37.070
We are pretty true to ourself.

36:37.075 --> 36:42.501
We never bargain with our stuff, you know.
We just release it.

36:42.536 --> 36:45.277
If people don't like it,
then fuck them!

36:45.312 --> 36:46.742
That's why we are here.

36:46.777 --> 36:49.647
Germany sucks for us!

36:49.682 --> 36:52.979
We are here to make,
you know, a statement,

36:53.014 --> 36:55.281
saying that,
"Yeah Mayhem. We rule."

36:55.286 --> 36:59.417
"We are the fucking best
metal band out there. "

36:59.452 --> 37:02.420
If people don't recognise it,
fuck them!

37:02.625 --> 37:06.227
We never negotiate
or come to terms.

37:06.262 --> 37:08.232
Fuck you!
You know what I mean?

37:08.267 --> 37:09.636
Can you repeat the question?

37:09.641 --> 37:12.295
- A lot of people we talk to have said that...
- What?

37:12.330 --> 37:14.418
I said that black metal is
starting to lose touch...

37:14.423 --> 37:16.108
- Who are they?

37:16.113 --> 37:19.348
Which one?
Who the fuck are you talking to?

37:19.383 --> 37:21.338
Fuck them, you know!

37:21.373 --> 37:23.949
- You have any comments about that?
- Fuck that.

37:23.954 --> 37:27.609
Yeah, I have a comment.
Fuck you! You know.

37:30.051 --> 37:34.142
Beer and interviews?
Not a good combination.

37:35.453 --> 37:39.180
But I know one guy who can deliver
is Ronnie James Dio.

37:39.392 --> 37:41.794
He's the godfather of power metal,

37:41.829 --> 37:45.156
metal's most over-the-top
and fantastical sub-genre.

37:45.429 --> 37:50.207
Think swords, sorcery,
chivalry and Dungeons & Dragons,

37:50.242 --> 37:52.243
and you've got power metal.

37:52.248 --> 37:55.480
One of the thing Ronnie is known for
is inventing the devil horns,

37:55.482 --> 37:58.889
the most enduring symbol
of heavy metal culture.

37:58.894 --> 38:00.878
I'm of Italian extraction and, um...

38:00.913 --> 38:04.884
my grandparents on both sides,
both my mother's and father's sides,

38:04.889 --> 38:09.687
came to America from Italy
and they had superstitions.

38:09.692 --> 38:12.390
And I will always see my grandmother
when I was a little kid

38:12.395 --> 38:14.462
were holding my hand and
walking down the street,

38:14.497 --> 38:16.923
and she would see
someone and go...

38:18.196 --> 38:21.700
"What's that?" and eventualy learn
that it was called the meloik,

38:21.705 --> 38:26.638
a meloik was someone giving us the evil eye,
so she was giving us protection against the evil eye.

38:26.673 --> 38:28.904
Or you could give someone
the evil eye, too.

38:28.909 --> 38:30.201
So, invent it? No.

38:30.236 --> 38:33.301
But perfect it and make
it important? Yes.

38:33.306 --> 38:37.112
Because I did it so much, especially within the
confines of that great band the Sabbath,

38:37.117 --> 38:41.607
which have this incredible name already and you put
that together with of what people think it is.

38:41.839 --> 38:46.327
But for me because I'm lucky enough to kind of...
Just have done it so much,

38:46.362 --> 38:48.963
it's been more equated with me
than anyone else.

38:48.968 --> 38:50.941
although Gene Simmons would
tell you that he invented it,

38:50.946 --> 38:56.006
but then again, Gene invented breathing,
and shoes and everything, you know.

38:56.011 --> 38:57.811
What makes metal unique?

38:57.846 --> 39:01.305
What makes the fans and the
culture of metal unique, do you think?

39:01.310 --> 39:05.916
I think it's probably more than anything, the fact that
it becomes a great big family of people

39:05.951 --> 39:10.922
who all share one thing,
and that is metal.

39:10.927 --> 39:14.890
We just love it, and it's really
them against the world.

39:14.925 --> 39:19.454
It really is, and I think that's...
that's its importance and why it lasts so long.

39:19.462 --> 39:22.724
Thanks, guys.
Thanks, Ronnie. That was great.

39:53.996 --> 39:55.876
It's clear from my experience here,

39:55.881 --> 39:58.469
that heavy metal shares
something with all cultures

39:58.474 --> 40:01.135
A sense of belonging to a way of life.

40:01.140 --> 40:05.237
Now that I've explored the roots of metal
and what it means to its fans

40:05.272 --> 40:10.841
It's time to turn my attention to why metal has
provoked such strong negative reactions in people.

40:10.846 --> 40:16.969
Why has heavy metal been consistently
stereotyped, dismissed and condemned?

40:21.157 --> 40:24.002
I ask you, is there anybody
with better lyrics than Lemmy?

40:24.007 --> 40:29.321
His opening line on that masterpiece is
"If you squeeze my lizard".

40:29.494 --> 40:32.131
How can you not love Lemmy?

40:32.166 --> 40:34.273
We have Sam Dunn in the studio with us.

40:34.308 --> 40:38.372
Sam has been travelling around the world
making a documentary on heavy metal.

40:38.377 --> 40:39.485
Welcome to New York, Sam.
You're just back from the Wacken festival.

40:39.520 --> 40:42.775
We hear you're just back from the
Wacken festival in Germany

40:42.810 --> 40:46.246
That must have been a blast,
I always wanted to check that out myself.

40:46.281 --> 40:51.094
Real quick, is there anybody that completely...
Your favourite interview so far?

40:51.099 --> 40:57.290
That's hard to choose but I have to say,
probably, given my long history as a fan in music,

40:57.325 --> 40:58.650
Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden.

40:58.652 --> 41:02.064
We got to interviewed him right on the
stage of the Hammersmith Odeon.

41:02.066 --> 41:05.565
-  Wow.
- With the balcony in the background,
it was totally amazing.

41:05.600 --> 41:08.669
And we hear you gonna interviewing
Dee Snider tomorrow.

41:08.674 --> 41:12.239
Dee's always a blast to talk to
and always outspoken.

41:12.244 --> 41:13.682
Make sure you say
hello for me.

41:14.616 --> 41:17.638
CENSORSHIP

41:35.997 --> 41:38.162
To some parents in the 1980s,

41:38.197 --> 41:42.434
Dee Snider of Twisted Sister was the
most dangerous guy on the planet.

41:42.469 --> 41:45.774
This was when metal met
its first organised attack.

41:45.779 --> 41:50.774
Twisted Sister and eight other metal bands
were place on a list called the Filthy Fifteen,

41:50.809 --> 41:55.514
because their music was deemed offensive
by the Parents' Music Resource Center.

41:55.549 --> 41:58.953
Dee Snider was summoned
to testify before the US Congress

41:58.958 --> 42:02.051
to defend his music and his livelihood.

42:14.799 --> 42:20.571
1984 was a pretty insane time
for Twisted Sister.

42:20.576 --> 42:25.009
We were hearing bits and pieces
about this Parents' Music Resource Center

42:25.044 --> 42:28.581
and Tipper Gore,
but not really registering

42:28.616 --> 42:33.752
because we were getting protests
and religious groups at every show.

42:33.787 --> 42:37.598
So, just another parent group
that, you know,

42:37.633 --> 42:41.160
was putting Twisted Sister
on a list of targets.

42:41.165 --> 42:46.499
We have always, uh... talked about
the positive aspects of the music industry,

42:46.504 --> 42:51.666
but of course, the highlight has been on
the excesses that have been allowed to develop

42:51.701 --> 42:54.944
as we have tried to focus
our concern on those excesses.

42:54.949 --> 42:58.451
Somebody told us
that the Senate committee

42:58.486 --> 43:01.684
was having a hearing on censorship
with the PRMC

43:01.719 --> 43:04.379
and wanted to know
if I would come and speak.

43:04.648 --> 43:09.922
Now, my view of it, when I heard it, was
They want me to carry the flag into battle.

43:09.957 --> 43:12.233
"Hell, yeah! Braveheart,  baby!"

43:12.268 --> 43:14.371
Braveheart wasn't even out,
but that sort of mentality.

43:14.376 --> 43:16.897
"Give me the fucking flag, man.
Let's go!"

43:16.902 --> 43:21.535
I knew that they were, like everybody else,
grossly underestimating me.

43:21.570 --> 43:26.016
I knew that they viewed me as
just another dunderheaded rocker

43:26.051 --> 43:30.276
and they would bring me in, make me look like a fool,
and I would help their cause.

43:30.281 --> 43:34.645
They did not know that I could construct
a sentence and speak English fluently.

43:34.680 --> 43:39.446
And I'm there in my cut-off denim,
my skin-tight jeans, my snakeskin boots,

43:39.448 --> 43:42.740
and a little bit of eye make-up
and my big hair.

43:42.742 --> 43:46.660
And I ain't getting dressed up for nobody.
I'm a dirtbag and I'm proud.

43:46.665 --> 43:49.437
And I'm playing these people like,
you know...

43:49.442 --> 43:51.864
I'm setting up these guys for the kill.

43:51.869 --> 43:57.202
I have got my speech in my back pocket,
which I have worked on for a few weeks

43:57.237 --> 44:00.940
and honed and refined
till it's a fricking nuclear weapon,

44:00.975 --> 44:05.922
folded up like a gazillion times, like a bad kid
bringing his homework to school.

44:05.957 --> 44:10.384
I open it up and I'm flattening it
out on the table, really deliberate.

44:10.419 --> 44:16.154
And they're going, "Oh, man, this is
a lamb being brought to the slaughter. "

44:16.189 --> 44:17.558
And I start reading.

44:17.593 --> 44:20.716
"Since I am the only person
addressing this committee today

44:20.721 --> 44:26.397
"who has been a direct target of accusations
from the presumably responsible PMRC,

44:26.402 --> 44:29.918
"I would like to speak
on a more personal note

44:29.953 --> 44:35.711
"and show just how unfair the whole concept of
lyrical interpretation and judgment can be,

44:35.746 --> 44:39.810
"and how this can amount to little more
than character assassination. "

44:39.815 --> 44:43.981
And I am just tearing apart everything
that they have accused me of,

44:44.016 --> 44:47.312
disproving without...
beyond a shadow of a doubt,

44:47.347 --> 44:50.594
that everything they've accused me of
has been wrong, false,

44:50.599 --> 44:53.644
and they are scrambling,
scrambling, scrambling.

44:55.296 --> 44:59.298
They said that Under The Blade
was about sadomasochism and bondage.

44:59.333 --> 45:02.739
It was about my guitar
player's throat operation.

45:02.774 --> 45:08.108
It's not really a... a wild leap of
the imagination to jump to the conclusion

45:08.143 --> 45:12.211
that that's about something other
than surgery or hospitals,

45:12.246 --> 45:14.548
neither of which are
mentioned in the song.

45:14.583 --> 45:18.596
No, it's not a wild jump
and I think what I said at one point

45:18.601 --> 45:21.654
was that songs allow a person
to put their own imagination,

45:21.659 --> 45:24.626
experiences and dreams
into the lyrics.

45:24.661 --> 45:26.792
Uh... people can interpret it many ways.

45:26.827 --> 45:30.872
Ms Gore was looking for sadomasochism
and bondage and she found it.

45:30.877 --> 45:34.834
Someone looking for surgical references
would have found it as well.

45:35.190 --> 45:38.505
I said, "I can't help that
Tipper Gore's got a dirty mind",

45:38.540 --> 45:42.074
and Al Gore just... Oh, my God,
he nearly jumped over the table.

45:42.109 --> 45:47.012
They said We're Not Gonna Take It
should be on the Filthy Fifteen for violence,

45:47.047 --> 45:50.749
and it was no more violent
than the Declaration of Independence.

45:50.784 --> 45:54.522
The PRMC rated songs
according to violence, the occult,

45:54.557 --> 45:56.657
sex, drugs and alcohol,

45:56.692 --> 46:01.865
and although Snider talked about throat
operations and standing up for your rights

46:01.870 --> 46:05.402
most metal songs deal with
much more provocative themes.

46:05.437 --> 46:10.455
Themes like hedonism, religion,
death and sexuality.

46:10.771 --> 46:13.463
GENDER AND SEXUALITY

46:49.243 --> 46:53.401
Heavy metal has always traditionally
been male-dominated.

46:53.403 --> 46:54.713
Fact.

46:54.718 --> 46:58.184
It was a boys' club in the way that
the music was very aggressive

46:58.219 --> 47:02.187
and it wasn't particularly sympathetic
towards getting a female audience.

47:02.222 --> 47:04.855
It wasn't excluding in deliberately,
but it's the way it went.

47:04.890 --> 47:08.883
It's very strong music
sonically and...

47:09.395 --> 47:12.064
you're supposed to be strong.

47:12.099 --> 47:15.436
Um... you don't look terribly strong.

47:15.471 --> 47:17.802
But you know, on... on the tour buses,

47:17.837 --> 47:22.675
the guys work out with weights, before
they go on stage, to get their muscles.

47:22.710 --> 47:25.511
So, strength is one of the elements.

47:25.546 --> 47:34.186
But also, using tools very effectively is another
part of that working-class masculine ethos.

47:34.221 --> 47:38.462
Because so much of metal
came out of a musician's attitude.

47:38.497 --> 47:43.329
Young men that wanted to play blistering
solos, that wanted to play real fast.

47:43.364 --> 47:45.899
This kind of urge of teenage angst,

47:45.934 --> 47:49.219
combined with a desire
to be a good player,

47:49.254 --> 47:52.337
was what represented
a lot of our early audience.

47:52.372 --> 47:56.209
And for some reason,
that seemed to be mostly young guys.

47:56.244 --> 48:01.708
All of the anxieties that you get, uh...
you know, as a young man about gender,

48:01.743 --> 48:03.881
for a while at least, those are gone.

48:03.916 --> 48:07.651
It's not about how to deal with women.
There just aren't any.

48:07.686 --> 48:11.490
So, you get this sort of heroic
male-only world

48:11.525 --> 48:14.324
where men band together
and do the job.

48:14.359 --> 48:18.329
That's a way of thinking about gender
by not thinking about gender.

48:18.364 --> 48:23.003
If you want to call it sexist, you
could, but you'd be missing something.

48:23.038 --> 48:27.999
"Masculine" in Western culture
means freedom.

48:28.205 --> 48:32.749
Um... and women are always trying
to tie them down and domesticate them.

48:32.784 --> 48:35.713
So, that's part of the masculinity element.

48:35.748 --> 48:44.359
Metal is probably the last bastion
of real rebellion, real masculinity,

48:44.394 --> 48:48.562
real... real men basically getting together
and beating their chests.

48:48.597 --> 48:52.377
It's perfectly all right for guys to go
to a metal show,

48:52.412 --> 48:56.370
take their shirts off and swing them above
their heads and go completely insane,

48:56.375 --> 49:00.779
instead of trying to be these,
like, sensitive morons, or whatever.

49:00.814 --> 49:04.276
Yeah, I love women and I'm...
I'm totally respectful to them.

49:04.311 --> 49:06.516
But at the same time, I'm a guy.

49:06.551 --> 49:09.980
I like hanging out with guys and
doing dumb shit. It's just that simple.

49:09.985 --> 49:14.310
Metal is one of the few places
where you can actually embrace that.

49:22.192 --> 49:26.531
On the surface, metal appears
to be hyper-masculine and aggressive.

49:26.566 --> 49:28.701
But is it that straightforward?

49:28.736 --> 49:34.006
There's another part of this culture
where the guys actually look like girls.

49:34.241 --> 49:36.710
Who could forget glam metal?

49:36.745 --> 49:40.114
Influenced by the shock rock bands
of the 1970s,

49:40.119 --> 49:46.237
glam was largely responsible for making metal
the world's most popular music during the 1980s.

49:46.386 --> 49:49.957
So, I'm heading to its birthplace,
the Sunset Strip,

49:49.962 --> 49:52.799
to talk with Motley Crue's lead singer,
Vince Neil,

49:52.804 --> 49:57.850
about how the heavy metal image
transformed from leather to lace.

50:31.662 --> 50:34.331
Everybody came to LA to play.

50:34.366 --> 50:38.437
And it was a crazy scene, you know?
I mean, Sunset Boulevard was, uh...

50:38.472 --> 50:43.002
just packed with... with people
just dressed in... from,

50:43.037 --> 50:46.307
you know, from punks to
the new romantic to...

50:46.310 --> 50:48.934
to heavy metal to...

50:49.180 --> 50:51.650
I mean, it had everything.
And everything in between.

50:51.685 --> 50:54.985
Sunset Boulevard would be packed,
thousands of people.

50:54.990 --> 50:57.164
Guys that looked like girls,
girls that looked like guys.

50:57.166 --> 50:59.444
It was just bizarre.

50:59.446 --> 51:04.232
We just wanted to look tough,
you know, with the leather and stuff.

51:04.234 --> 51:07.859
And obviously, when you do
a photo session, you put make-up on.

51:07.861 --> 51:10.717
You gotta try and look good.
It just turned out that way.

51:10.719 --> 51:14.039
And then with the next...
the next version of Motley,

51:14.041 --> 51:19.247
Theatre of Pain,  we just wanted to go
completely opposite to what we just did.

51:19.282 --> 51:22.412
- More laces and frilly stuff.
-  Uh-huh.

51:22.447 --> 51:25.052
You know, just to get people talking.

51:25.057 --> 51:26.648
I don't know how to explain it.

51:26.683 --> 51:31.744
I never questioned my sexuality at any point
and I was up there in lingerie.

51:31.790 --> 51:36.382
And... my wife was... well, then girlfriend, she
was the one dressing me up half the time.

51:36.384 --> 51:38.193
I was going, "OK, great. Whatever.

51:38.195 --> 51:39.718
"Stockings... Let's do it.

51:39.720 --> 51:41.816
It's going to get me more attention?
It's going to get me into trouble?

51:41.818 --> 51:44.368
"Let's do it. Gonna freak people out?
Fuck, yeah. "

51:44.403 --> 51:48.372
So, I sit down with Poison,
as a photographer at that point,

51:48.407 --> 51:51.111
and they're showing me Vogue
and Elle,  saying,

51:51.146 --> 51:52.676
"This is what we want to look like. "

51:52.711 --> 51:55.156
On the first album cover,
that's what they got.

51:55.191 --> 51:58.751
There were guys on the Strip
that wanted to fuck them.

51:58.756 --> 52:02.556
It's rebellion against
what men are supposed to be like,

52:02.561 --> 52:05.926
grabbing onto signs
that are associated with women,

52:05.961 --> 52:10.665
make-up, long hair, clothes that are
colourful and flashy and everything.

52:10.700 --> 52:13.732
That becomes your
hyper-masculine identity

52:13.767 --> 52:15.969
is to look very much like a woman.

52:16.004 --> 52:19.004
What are you going to do
if you want to rebel as a man?

52:19.039 --> 52:23.508
You gonna get an even more
severe suit than your dad?

52:23.543 --> 52:26.344
You can't go that direction.
But you can gender-bend.

52:26.379 --> 52:31.586
Some fan was writing to a magazine and
talked about having the guts to be glam,

52:31.591 --> 52:36.387
so that being feminine is the most masculine
thing that you can do in this world.

52:36.392 --> 52:39.629
It shows us so many other things we take
to be natural and unchanging,

52:39.664 --> 52:42.559
and just the way things are,
are not just the way things are.

52:42.594 --> 52:46.463
An intriguing thing
about heavy metal music

52:46.498 --> 52:51.536
is how you've got these either
very feminine, preening, on one side,

52:51.571 --> 52:55.739
or ultra-masculine,
cock-rocking, skin-tight,

52:55.741 --> 53:00.649
check-out-the-bulge-in-my-pants,
for an audience that was 90% male.

53:00.684 --> 53:04.786
Anyway you sliced it, there's something
homoerotic about it, and bizarre.

53:04.791 --> 53:11.046
There's some weirdness about the whole
male viewing guys looking like women

53:11.081 --> 53:17.160
or men being actual, you know,
very strutty and almost like...

53:17.195 --> 53:22.337
not almost, you know,
West-Village gay leather look.

53:22.472 --> 53:25.775
There's really...
Some doctors need to look into this.

53:25.810 --> 53:30.008
There were fans who rejected all that
and said, "That's gay. That's not... "

53:30.013 --> 53:33.874
Those were fans who didn't
understand what gay is.

53:33.909 --> 53:37.455
That Rob Halford was gay and
was putting on these spectacles

53:37.457 --> 53:40.656
in basic leather-bar,
gay clothing, you know.

53:40.654 --> 53:42.854
With the leather and the studs.

53:42.889 --> 53:44.963
Gay fans knew
where that was coming from.

53:44.998 --> 53:48.042
Straight fans saw that
as straighter than anybody,

53:48.077 --> 53:51.761
when, in fact, it was
coming right out of the club.

53:51.766 --> 53:55.031
What would you say
if you saw Rob Halford, right now?

53:55.066 --> 53:56.802
I'd jump his bones.

53:56.807 --> 54:00.258
Even though only 10%
of the audience may be women,

54:01.143 --> 54:04.411
it was not a big gay scene
backstage at most concerts.

54:04.446 --> 54:06.448
Matter of fact, I never even saw one.

54:06.483 --> 54:09.486
Rob Halford kept it hidden forever,

54:09.521 --> 54:12.252
and I know a couple other...

54:12.254 --> 54:16.788
gay heavy metallists
who would never show their colours.

54:16.793 --> 54:20.926
Heavy metal rock and roll
is very masculine, you know, very hetero.

54:20.961 --> 54:25.376
When a guy's up there in a skin-tight
pair of leather pants, humping the air,

54:25.411 --> 54:29.299
they're not looking at it as
"Oh, man, he's shaking his dick at me. "

54:29.334 --> 54:34.307
They looking that "Yeah, man. Yeah, fuck that shit."
"I wish I was him. He must be getting laid. "

54:34.312 --> 54:37.879
I, at the time, had never drank,
I had never done drugs,

54:37.884 --> 54:40.547
I'd never had sex,
I'd never broken the law.

54:40.552 --> 54:42.136
As I was listening to Motley Crue,

54:42.171 --> 54:44.985
it seemed like that was basically
the only thing that they did.

54:44.990 --> 54:48.119
According to their lyrics,
That was the totality of their existence.

54:48.124 --> 54:51.298
When you're with Motley, you learn
a lot about the willingness of a female,

54:51.333 --> 54:53.654
and you'll learn a lot
about how...

54:53.689 --> 54:56.454
women will find themselves
in amazingly compromising positions

54:56.459 --> 54:59.029
without... any shame.

54:59.034 --> 55:02.401
There's a situation you would have
boyfriends waiting outside the bus

55:02.436 --> 55:05.574
while their girls were in the back, heels up.

55:05.579 --> 55:09.565
And you were just astounded
as to how is this guy, you know...

55:09.600 --> 55:12.078
She thinks she's going in there
for an autograph?

55:12.113 --> 55:15.849
When she comes out and kisses him
it's not gonna taste like Doublemint!

55:15.884 --> 55:19.950
When I was young, my bedroom was
plastered with photos of heavy metallers

55:19.985 --> 55:22.921
and the occasional half-dressed groupie.

55:22.956 --> 55:25.468
I'm going to talk to the world's
most famous groupie,

55:25.470 --> 55:28.415
Pamela des Barres,
who wrote I'm With The Band,

55:28.417 --> 55:31.452
a first-hand account
of the groupie lifestyle.

55:31.454 --> 55:36.536
This is a perspective on sexuality in
metal culture that you rarely get to hear.

55:36.541 --> 55:38.607
What is a groupie, to you?

55:38.642 --> 55:42.436
A groupie is a girl, usually,
who wants to hang around with groups.

55:42.471 --> 55:44.896
That's where the word comes from.

55:45.077 --> 55:49.385
I'm with the band, you want to hang out,
you want to be in the middle of that sound.

55:49.390 --> 55:51.982
It makes you feel so good,
it makes you feel so hot.

55:52.017 --> 55:53.750
It makes you feel like
anything could happen.

55:53.785 --> 55:58.255
It started with Zeppelin, I think.
I think the debauchery.

55:58.290 --> 56:02.926
Of course, I mean, please.
I know girls Elvis had plenty of sex with.

56:02.961 --> 56:04.597
It's been going on forever.

56:04.632 --> 56:11.571
But the idea, of women going to extremes
to be with a guy, started with Zeppelin.

56:11.606 --> 56:18.410
The big debate is that groupies are perceived
as being objectified, a powerless kind of girl...

56:18.415 --> 56:23.280
That is so lame! Because they are
exactly where they want to be.

56:23.285 --> 56:26.883
Women who are hanging out with bands
are not dragged and coerced

56:26.918 --> 56:30.246
into the band's bedrooms
or backstage or buses or anything.

56:30.281 --> 56:31.527
They want to be there.

56:31.529 --> 56:36.661
They make every effort in the world
to get where they can be with these bands.

56:36.663 --> 56:38.363
They're doing exactly
what they want to do.

56:38.398 --> 56:41.287
I love women. I think they should be
naked backstage all the time.

56:41.322 --> 56:44.691
I love lookin' at 'em. It's great.

56:46.836 --> 56:48.906
I'm not sorry for one moment of it.

56:48.941 --> 56:53.678
You'd get done, send 'em out the back,
have them come through the front door.

56:53.713 --> 56:57.723
Sex, drugs and rock and roll.
That's exactly the way you live.

56:57.758 --> 57:02.219
And then finally you start realising,
"Shit, this is a job too. "

57:02.254 --> 57:05.292
You know, it's a business.
It's not just constant partying.

57:05.297 --> 57:08.124
When I got off the road and I was done,

57:08.159 --> 57:13.195
it took me a long time to be able
to embrace a woman, with any integrity.

57:13.230 --> 57:14.592
They were all pigs.

57:14.594 --> 57:22.861
And, you know, a lot of these guys
are still headfucked about it.

57:22.896 --> 57:27.446
A lot of guys still try to live that lifestyle
because they don't know anything else.

57:27.481 --> 57:29.705
You become a product of that
environment and go,

57:29.707 --> 57:31.914
"My God! What did I do?"

57:31.916 --> 57:34.877
And then as you grow older, you go,
"I'm gonna have a kids someday"

57:34.912 --> 57:37.322
"And if it's a girl and somebody
does this to her, I'll kill him. "

57:37.357 --> 57:40.724
People ask if I'd let my daughter do it.
Yes, I would.

57:40.759 --> 57:43.461
I had fun. I had a great time.

57:43.466 --> 57:46.399
I wouldn't change any of my experiences.

57:46.404 --> 57:49.232
In the classic age of metal,

57:49.237 --> 57:53.471
women didn't participate
or create it or have any power in it.

57:53.506 --> 57:57.377
All women did was hold the boyfriend's
jacket at the corner of the pit.

57:57.382 --> 58:01.606
They were not involved at all.
But then something happened.

58:09.753 --> 58:13.159
With Girlschool,
there's a definite element of respect.

58:13.194 --> 58:17.692
When we go on stage, people give us
a great deal of respect, which is fantastic.

58:17.695 --> 58:19.816
But I've been in bands
before Girlschool,

58:19.851 --> 58:24.901
with people asking me
if I'm tuning the guitar for the guitarist,

58:24.936 --> 58:27.437
or, you know,
that sort of patronising comment.

58:27.472 --> 58:31.007
'Cause they don't expect a female
to get up and play guitar.

58:31.042 --> 58:33.280
That's the way it's always been.

58:33.315 --> 58:39.577
Everybody tried to, you know...
put me a little bit more into like the...

58:40.118 --> 58:43.718
you know, the female...
the sexy image and...

58:43.853 --> 58:46.994
But without power
and I didn't like that

58:47.029 --> 58:48.679
and people in the
record company said,

58:48.714 --> 58:52.931
"Get rid of the black leather.
That's number one. Be more of a girl. "

58:52.966 --> 58:56.266
I thought, "Oh, no, no, no, no.
I can't. I can't do it. "

58:56.301 --> 59:00.240
I don't want to do it.
I definitely want to, you know, be myself.

59:00.245 --> 59:02.071
Talent isn't always enough...

59:02.106 --> 59:04.140
In the eyes of the masses and the public.

59:04.175 --> 59:07.595
You have to be attractive
and it's annoying. I mean...

59:07.878 --> 59:10.914
-  Why?
- Ugly dudes all across the board for metal.

59:10.949 --> 59:14.055
- Yeah, exactly.
- Across the board.

59:14.090 --> 59:18.392
Any band you can mention,
I'll tell you they're ugly.

59:18.427 --> 59:22.425
We took Girlschool on their first tour,
you know.

59:22.460 --> 59:25.028
Nobody else would touch them
with a yardstick.

59:25.063 --> 59:27.632
Even the rest of my band said,
"Oh, they're girls. "

59:27.667 --> 59:30.861
I said, "Fuck that. They're good. "
It doesn't matter.

59:30.896 --> 59:33.824
People would always say about Kelly,
"Oh she's pretty good for a girl.

59:33.826 --> 59:36.309
I'd say, "Better than you, man "
You know.

59:36.344 --> 59:40.810
I asked Kim and Jackie
about metal being a boys' club.

59:40.845 --> 59:43.014
- And they agreed.
- Well...

59:43.049 --> 59:47.781
They have as much fun on the road
as I've ever seen a guy band have.

59:48.117 --> 59:51.078
I mean, they're disgraceful,
you know what I mean?

59:51.321 --> 59:54.325
And they'd drink under the table too.

59:54.360 --> 59:56.147
I've no more questions.

59:56.182 --> 59:59.928
You didn't even ask what
it's like to be an all-girl band.

59:59.931 --> 01:00:02.367
- OK, what is it like?
-  Crap!

01:00:02.402 --> 01:00:04.100
What's it like to be an all-guy band?

01:00:04.105 --> 01:00:07.909
Since Girlschool, women have become
much more visible in metal,

01:00:07.914 --> 01:00:11.076
not only they fronting some of
the biggest metal bands,

01:00:11.111 --> 01:00:14.103
but they are now mastering the once
male-dominated technique,

01:00:14.105 --> 01:00:16.584
of extreme guttural vocals.

01:00:53.182 --> 01:00:55.162
When you go on the festival

01:00:55.164 --> 01:00:58.090
you meet lots of women nowadays
who are in the band, and so,

01:00:58.092 --> 01:01:00.757
it's not that boys' club anymore.

01:01:00.792 --> 01:01:04.154
I think boys are happy about that as well.
It must have been a bit boring.

01:01:04.156 --> 01:01:08.133
Just guys, sweaty ugly guys
around you.

01:01:08.135 --> 01:01:14.374
Nowadays, it's a couple of females.
It kind of loosens it up, you know.

01:01:14.409 --> 01:01:20.311
A lot of young girls say, "I saw you live and
it was great to see a woman pull that off.

01:01:20.346 --> 01:01:23.164
"And I just joined a band
and I want to do that myself. "

01:01:23.169 --> 01:01:26.988
Is having a tough persona
on stage important to you?

01:01:26.993 --> 01:01:32.624
Yeah. Because I am tough on stage.
I feel very strong on stage,

01:01:32.659 --> 01:01:36.195
and I want to give that to the
people in front of that stage,

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:39.666
that you can just have
a lot of strength and power

01:01:39.701 --> 01:01:42.699
and give it to these people
and they take a bit of that home.

01:01:42.704 --> 01:01:45.963
Arch Enemy!

01:02:02.686 --> 01:02:04.401
Thank you very much.

01:02:05.370 --> 01:02:09.321
RELIGION AND SATANISM

01:02:10.161 --> 01:02:13.266
Being called sexist and
a boys' club is one thing,

01:02:13.301 --> 01:02:16.933
but what about metal
being called blasphemous?

01:02:17.068 --> 01:02:19.603
I'm going to talk
to Ronnie James Dio again.

01:02:19.638 --> 01:02:21.908
We really hit it off at the
Wacken festival

01:02:21.913 --> 01:02:25.779
so he invited me over to his house
to continue our conversation.

01:02:25.784 --> 01:02:30.588
Like many metal artists, Ronnie's music
is full of religious symbolism,

01:02:30.593 --> 01:02:35.887
yet his message is often at odds with
these religions, especially Christianity.

01:02:35.922 --> 01:02:38.016
So, I'm curious to hear
what Ronnie has to say

01:02:38.051 --> 01:02:41.357
about metal's religious obsession.

01:03:21.167 --> 01:03:24.103
Do you know if anyone
holds the patent to this?

01:03:24.138 --> 01:03:26.476
No, I don't think anyone does.

01:03:26.511 --> 01:03:29.800
There you go, then, pal.
I think it's time to do a Gene Simmons.

01:03:29.805 --> 01:03:32.103
I understood that Gene
had found out that...

01:03:32.105 --> 01:03:37.885
OJ, as in orange juice, had never
been patented before, so he patented it.

01:03:37.890 --> 01:03:39.981
So, every time anyone
mentions OJ

01:03:40.016 --> 01:03:42.437
I don't know about OJ Simpson
but orange juice

01:03:42.472 --> 01:03:44.498
he gets some money from it.

01:03:44.533 --> 01:03:47.190
Which seems so Gene-ish to me.

01:03:47.225 --> 01:03:50.326
'Cause he's so brilliant at that.
He's absolutely brilliant.

01:03:50.361 --> 01:03:52.821
I'm interested in getting
your perspective on

01:03:52.856 --> 01:03:55.834
how religion has played a part
in the music you've made.

01:03:55.839 --> 01:04:00.026
I was always afraid, as a kid, of the nuns,
you know, the big penguins,

01:04:00.028 --> 01:04:03.980
that were gonna smack you in the head
with a ruler, which is what they did.

01:04:04.015 --> 01:04:08.416
Or the fact that if you do something wrong
you're going to go to hell.

01:04:08.451 --> 01:04:11.250
And, uh... you know, you're going
to suffer terribly.

01:04:11.285 --> 01:04:13.787
And I'm, "Give me a break here.
What's going on?"

01:04:13.822 --> 01:04:15.956
That's why for me the whole world
is heaven and hell.

01:04:15.991 --> 01:04:19.423
That song is about that.
The fact that we, in my mind...

01:04:19.458 --> 01:04:21.726
we live in heaven
and we live in hell.

01:04:21.761 --> 01:04:24.562
God and the devil are
inherent in each of us

01:04:24.597 --> 01:04:26.010
and it's our choice to make.

01:04:26.012 --> 01:04:29.599
You can take the road to good
and take the road to bad.

01:04:29.601 --> 01:04:33.840
If there wasn't Christianity,
we wouldn't have metal as we know it.

01:04:33.845 --> 01:04:37.373
Religion is really crucial to it.

01:04:37.508 --> 01:04:43.743
Most of the creators in metal,
at least in metal's first several eras,

01:04:44.347 --> 01:04:47.560
were raised... religiously.

01:04:47.595 --> 01:04:49.786
Many years ago
when we first started,

01:04:49.821 --> 01:04:53.922
somebody gave us some crosses,
and said, "These will protect you",

01:04:54.124 --> 01:04:57.328
and we never, ever went anywhere
without a cross on.

01:04:57.363 --> 01:05:00.600
I've never been on stage
without a cross.

01:05:00.635 --> 01:05:03.971
It's become the symbol
of the band all over.

01:05:04.006 --> 01:05:07.191
I got 'em all over my guitar.
We got 'em on stage.

01:05:07.226 --> 01:05:09.305
One place or another,
there's a cross.

01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:16.124
Heavy metal has pretty much from the dawn of
the genre been associated with Satanism.

01:05:16.159 --> 01:05:21.002
And while Black Sabbath sung principally about
Satan being something to be scared of,

01:05:21.037 --> 01:05:25.188
you know, some of this stuff could almost be
described as a Christian sentiment.

01:05:25.223 --> 01:05:27.690
The fans, however,
wanted a satanic band

01:05:27.725 --> 01:05:29.377
and eventually
commercial pressures

01:05:29.379 --> 01:05:35.920
meant that Black Sabbath exploited
this kind of connection between them

01:05:35.922 --> 01:05:38.838
and, uh... demonic imagery
and satanic ideas.

01:05:38.843 --> 01:05:41.170
Of course we got a lot of flack
for it from everybody else.

01:05:41.205 --> 01:05:46.646
There was things said about us being devil
worshippers and God knows what else.

01:05:46.651 --> 01:05:49.814
One particular thing that happened,

01:05:49.849 --> 01:05:52.353
here in Europe, was the Church, um...

01:05:52.388 --> 01:05:55.689
really tried to stop us
from playing in this town,

01:05:55.724 --> 01:05:58.284
whatever town it was,
escapes me now,

01:05:58.887 --> 01:06:03.960
and we didn't... They actually
did manage to stop us from playing.

01:06:03.995 --> 01:06:07.060
They banned the show.
And the church burnt down.

01:06:08.232 --> 01:06:11.135
Nothing to do with us.
But the church burnt down.

01:06:11.170 --> 01:06:16.007
But, of course, then it was to do with us.
They tried to turn it... It was our fault.

01:06:16.012 --> 01:06:20.744
I think when we used to use crosses
on stage on fire and stuff like that,

01:06:20.779 --> 01:06:22.348
probably didn't help.

01:06:22.353 --> 01:06:27.416
Who cannot think of Black Sabbath
without seeing one upside-down cross?

01:06:27.451 --> 01:06:30.520
Who cannot think of Slayer
without seeing a pentagram?

01:06:30.555 --> 01:06:37.628
You know, it's... Visually, it kind of ties
you to a certain band, to a certain sound.

01:06:37.663 --> 01:06:40.778
It's cool. And I don't think
any of the people that use them

01:06:40.783 --> 01:06:43.801
actually want Satan to rule the world.

01:06:43.836 --> 01:06:47.387
It's just something that enhances
the experience for people.

01:06:47.422 --> 01:06:52.083
The Satanism that you see is not Satanism.
It's some kind of...

01:06:53.078 --> 01:06:56.355
... you know, it's some kind
of caricature Satanism.

01:06:56.390 --> 01:06:57.671
Real satanism wouldn't be...

01:06:57.676 --> 01:07:00.184
If you're looking for Satanism,
first of all, you don't look to rock and roll.

01:07:00.219 --> 01:07:03.383
A bunch of kids running around
playing loud guitars,

01:07:03.418 --> 01:07:06.452
and going like that...
That's Halloween.

01:07:16.199 --> 01:07:20.138
When I first heard this band,
Venom, I wasn't thinking Halloween.

01:07:20.173 --> 01:07:23.810
I thought they were truly satanic,
and I wasn't the only one.

01:07:23.845 --> 01:07:27.349
I remember for me personally, Venom scared
the shit out of me when I first heard it.

01:07:27.354 --> 01:07:30.525
I actually refused to buy those records,
because I was scared.

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:34.383
I literally was scared I was doing
something wrong. It was like so extreme.

01:07:34.418 --> 01:07:37.153
And now, of course,
anyone seeing this video,

01:07:37.188 --> 01:07:40.490
looking at me as the guy that signed these
bands think that he was scared of Venom,

01:07:40.525 --> 01:07:41.974
they're gonna wet their pants.

01:07:41.979 --> 01:07:44.293
But it was different thing back then.
This was unheard of.

01:07:44.328 --> 01:07:48.331
That shit was really, really, truly
disturbing and scary when it came out.

01:07:48.366 --> 01:07:53.204
Look how big Venom got because of it.
It's a way for bands to become popular.

01:07:53.209 --> 01:07:58.080
Although Venom and other early satanic
metal bands used Satan to shock people,

01:07:58.082 --> 01:08:01.314
Slayer's lyrics directly
attacked Christianity.

01:08:01.349 --> 01:08:05.147
And as a teenage boy, how could you
not get excited by album titles

01:08:05.182 --> 01:08:09.323
like Hell Awaits, Haunting the Chapel,
and Reign in Blood.

01:08:09.328 --> 01:08:11.713
Slayer was a leader of the
thrash metal movement,

01:08:11.748 --> 01:08:17.095
which was influenced by the new wave
of British heavy metal, punk and hardcore.

01:08:17.131 --> 01:08:20.129
Along with the world's biggest
metal band Metallica,

01:08:20.163 --> 01:08:23.834
they introduced a new level of speed
and intensity to the genre,

01:08:23.839 --> 01:08:28.492
and were known for using graphic lyrics
about war and religion.

01:08:29.712 --> 01:08:32.810
I like to take pot-shots at religion
because I think it's a...

01:08:32.845 --> 01:08:37.446
the biggest brainwashing thing
that is totally acceptable in America,

01:08:37.481 --> 01:08:40.317
and probably most
everyplace else in the world.

01:08:40.352 --> 01:08:42.553
Um, I just think it's a load of shit.

01:08:42.587 --> 01:08:47.259
Tom, another well-tread path with
you is your Christian background,

01:08:47.294 --> 01:08:49.261
and the juxtaposition
with your music.

01:08:49.265 --> 01:08:50.559
Catholic.

01:08:50.564 --> 01:08:54.000
What place do your personal beliefs
have in Slayer?

01:08:54.005 --> 01:08:56.337
I consider what we do art,
all right.

01:08:56.372 --> 01:09:00.203
And it's... Art can be a
reflection of society.

01:09:00.238 --> 01:09:01.926
You know what I mean?

01:09:02.504 --> 01:09:06.136
We're picking up the
dark reflections.

01:09:07.376 --> 01:09:11.288
You know, and that's what we're reflecting.
But evil's everywhere, man.

01:09:11.291 --> 01:09:14.685
Everybody's got it.
It sits really deep in everybody.

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:17.456
Some people can't control it
as much as others.

01:09:17.461 --> 01:09:19.859
But I think it's there.

01:09:19.863 --> 01:09:25.951
Regardless of whatever fuckin' religion you
believe in whatever it is you feel is right,

01:09:26.962 --> 01:09:30.073
everybody knows what's wrong.

01:09:30.109 --> 01:09:35.106
Everybody knows there's wrong things.
There are just things you do not do.

01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:37.743
And the people that don't
understand that or don't believe that,

01:09:37.747 --> 01:09:41.010
then they're not really connected
with themselves, spiritually.

01:09:41.045 --> 01:09:43.501
It doesn't matter what
the fuck you believe.

01:10:17.079 --> 01:10:20.080
With God Hates Us All,
I can't help but come back...

01:10:20.082 --> 01:10:23.088
- How does it fit in?
- How does it fit in?

01:10:23.123 --> 01:10:24.381
... to the... to the...
- He doesn't...

01:10:24.416 --> 01:10:25.958
He doesn't...

01:10:25.993 --> 01:10:27.353
God doesn't hate.

01:10:28.457 --> 01:10:30.664
It's a great fuckin' title.

01:10:30.699 --> 01:10:34.957
When they wanted to make that an album
title, I was like, "That's fuckin' really good!

01:10:34.992 --> 01:10:37.388
"I think it'll piss a lot of people off. "

01:10:58.521 --> 01:11:02.228
The bands that want to be the biggest
bad-asses, pick bad-ass subjects.

01:11:02.263 --> 01:11:04.821
It's not that these people
believe in this stuff.

01:11:04.856 --> 01:11:07.466
It's a cool imagery that
goes along with music.

01:11:07.501 --> 01:11:10.536
Some people do believe in it.
I'm not going to deny that there's...

01:11:10.571 --> 01:11:15.066
That the Norwegian bands are real.
They've proven they're real by their actions.

01:11:15.606 --> 01:11:19.980
OK, so Venom
and Slayer aren't real Satanists,

01:11:20.015 --> 01:11:22.412
but many fans, including me,

01:11:22.447 --> 01:11:25.883
wonder if the Norwegian
black metal bands are the real thing.

01:11:25.918 --> 01:11:30.186
So, I've come to Norway,
an isolated country in northern Europe.

01:11:30.221 --> 01:11:35.526
87% of Norway's population belongs
to the Lutheran State Church.

01:11:35.561 --> 01:11:39.433
And yet strangely,
Norway's biggest cultural export

01:11:39.438 --> 01:11:42.194
is satanic black metal.

01:11:43.834 --> 01:11:46.800
We're filming a documentary.

01:11:47.471 --> 01:11:50.979
Uh, it's a documentary
on heavy metal music.

01:11:51.014 --> 01:11:54.678
We told 'em we were doing a
documentary on the history of metal,

01:11:54.713 --> 01:11:59.845
-  and he said, "Black metal?"
-  Did he say it like that?

01:12:00.016 --> 01:12:03.014
They know their metal here
in Norway, let me say.

01:12:24.175 --> 01:12:29.182
Like thrash, black metal evolved from punk
and the new wave of British heavy metal,

01:12:29.187 --> 01:12:32.985
with additional theatrical elements
borrowed from shock rock.

01:12:32.990 --> 01:12:36.986
Its sound is raw,
yet it is also epic and atmospheric,

01:12:36.991 --> 01:12:42.055
like punk rock meets Wagner,
dressed as Alice Cooper.

01:12:55.771 --> 01:12:58.207
My journey takes me
on an overnight train ride

01:12:58.242 --> 01:13:00.877
from the capital city Oslo to Bergen,

01:13:00.912 --> 01:13:04.469
a small town on the fjords
of the country's west coast.

01:13:04.817 --> 01:13:07.388
I'm here to talk to people
linked to incidents

01:13:07.393 --> 01:13:09.933
involving members of the
Norwegian black metal scene

01:13:09.938 --> 01:13:12.620
and some of the country's
oldest churches.

01:13:38.886 --> 01:13:40.618
My name is Rolf Rasmussen.

01:13:40.623 --> 01:13:46.291
I'm an assistant minister of this church,
Asane Church in Bergen, Norway.

01:13:46.296 --> 01:13:50.367
I had been here for three and a half years,
when suddenly,

01:13:50.402 --> 01:13:55.798
the night before Christmas Eve,
I received a call from a colleague,

01:13:55.803 --> 01:13:59.070
and he told me,
"The church is on fire. "

01:13:59.075 --> 01:14:02.273
And I fell into shivers,
right there in my bed.

01:14:02.278 --> 01:14:04.708
And I dressed to go to the scene.

01:14:04.713 --> 01:14:07.847
And coming to the church,
it was all flames.

01:14:07.882 --> 01:14:12.216
The firemen were trying to do their best
to contain the damage,

01:14:12.221 --> 01:14:15.718
and we were there, the staff,
looking at the flames

01:14:15.753 --> 01:14:21.979
and the smell was everywhere,
acrid and pungent.

01:14:24.526 --> 01:14:26.315
And, uh... the fire...

01:14:26.628 --> 01:14:29.861
The tower was still up
when we arrived,

01:14:29.866 --> 01:14:35.539
but after some time, maybe half and hour,
it fell heavily to the ground.

01:14:35.574 --> 01:14:39.476
This was a great loss,
not just to us personally,

01:14:39.511 --> 01:14:41.280
but to the whole community.

01:14:41.315 --> 01:14:45.085
This church had been standing here
for nearly 200 years.

01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:50.781
And I saw quite a lot of sad faces.
It was not a happy Christmas at all.

01:15:01.564 --> 01:15:05.302
Varg Vikernes, the most notorious
metal musician of all time,

01:15:05.337 --> 01:15:07.491
was implicated in a series of arsons

01:15:07.493 --> 01:15:12.502
that destroyed some of Norway's most
treasure historic churches in the early '90s.

01:15:12.508 --> 01:15:15.861
He was also convicted for murdering
a fellow black metal musician

01:15:15.866 --> 01:15:18.422
and is now serving a life sentence.

01:15:18.426 --> 01:15:22.226
J¢rn Tunsberg helped Varg
burn down the Asane church.

01:15:22.261 --> 01:15:26.425
He served his time and was
recently released from prison.

01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:32.094
We did meet with Rolf Rasmussen,
the minister of the Asane church, uh...

01:15:32.099 --> 01:15:34.661
- and interviewed him.
- OK.

01:15:35.097 --> 01:15:40.036
I'm very interested to hear from you, um...
your perspective on what happened.

01:15:40.071 --> 01:15:45.565
The most important thing that happened
was that a church was burned down.

01:15:47.109 --> 01:15:49.770
So, that's something
I stand for and

01:15:50.171 --> 01:15:55.883
I stood for it then, I will stand for it now,
and I will stand for it till I die.

01:15:56.552 --> 01:16:02.065
Why is it important to you
that you stand behind your actions?

01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:03.929
It's kind of, um...

01:16:03.959 --> 01:16:07.053
It's kind of a statement to...

01:16:07.930 --> 01:16:10.335
... to break down Christianity.

01:16:10.340 --> 01:16:14.202
Lately there's been
a small trend by some people

01:16:14.237 --> 01:16:18.935
to see Christianity and any
other established religion as the bad guy

01:16:18.937 --> 01:16:20.881
and Satan as the liberator,

01:16:20.916 --> 01:16:25.013
the one who can really,
uh... turn you into

01:16:25.048 --> 01:16:28.674
the powerful strong path
that you should lead.

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:37.323
What is the primary ideology or primary
ideas that fuel Gorgoroth's music?

01:16:43.535 --> 01:16:45.424
Satan.

01:16:53.142 --> 01:16:57.737
What does Satan embody
or what does he represent?

01:16:59.715 --> 01:17:01.503
Freedom.

01:17:01.538 --> 01:17:07.653
I think whether we like it or not,
black metal in Norway is known for, uh...

01:17:08.146 --> 01:17:13.130
a string of events that happened in
the early 1990s around a series of arsons.

01:17:13.135 --> 01:17:17.201
I'm interested to know your thoughts
on the actions of those events,

01:17:17.236 --> 01:17:21.642
the motivations behind those events,
whether you agree or disagree with them.

01:17:21.677 --> 01:17:26.608
Church burnings and all these
things are, of course,

01:17:26.643 --> 01:17:32.084
things that I support 100% and
it should have been done much more

01:17:32.089 --> 01:17:34.983
and will be done much more
in the future.

01:17:34.988 --> 01:17:41.057
We have to remove every trace
from what Christianity and, uh...

01:17:42.424 --> 01:17:48.200
... the Semitic roots
have to... offer this world.

01:17:48.235 --> 01:17:51.170
Satanism is freedom
for the individual

01:17:51.175 --> 01:17:53.507
to grow and to become the superman.

01:17:53.542 --> 01:17:57.754
Every man who is born to be king
becomes king.

01:17:57.789 --> 01:18:01.281
Every man who is born to be a slave,
doesn't know Satan.

01:18:01.316 --> 01:18:04.316
It's in effect
an elitist's religion.

01:18:04.321 --> 01:18:07.490
It's only for the best,
for the strongest,

01:18:07.495 --> 01:18:09.794
for the most successful.

01:18:09.829 --> 01:18:14.957
It's not for the timid or the weak.
And so...

01:18:14.992 --> 01:18:18.562
By that virtue alone,
it won't have a large following.

01:18:18.567 --> 01:18:22.232
What can you say?
Words of a Christian man.

01:18:22.237 --> 01:18:26.560
So, I don't care what
he will ever say, you know.

01:18:26.565 --> 01:18:30.242
I know for a fact that they have
lost a lot of followers

01:18:30.247 --> 01:18:34.335
so we have been giving them
a fist in the face.

01:18:35.946 --> 01:18:38.353
How do you feel about what
happened to the church?

01:18:38.388 --> 01:18:42.117
In a way, I think that
Christianity in Norway deserved it.

01:18:42.152 --> 01:18:47.936
It was... In the beginning it was, you know,
not something the Norwegians choose.

01:18:47.938 --> 01:18:50.426
It was forced upon them.

01:18:50.761 --> 01:18:54.196
You can say that's
a thousand years ago.

01:18:54.231 --> 01:18:58.461
But, you know, I wasn't sad.
I wasn't really happy either, but I mean...

01:18:59.067 --> 01:19:02.776
In a historical point of view,
Christianity deserved it, you know.

01:19:02.781 --> 01:19:06.109
I think society creates extreme people.

01:19:06.114 --> 01:19:11.404
It's like with, you know, a free democracy
usually deserves its leaders

01:19:11.747 --> 01:19:15.915
and it's... I would say,
it usually also deserves its outsiders.

01:19:16.919 --> 01:19:20.939
If every metal band wants to be
more extreme than those that came before

01:19:20.944 --> 01:19:24.565
then burning churches certainly
took things to a new level.

01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:27.197
But these actions say less
about metal's theatrics

01:19:27.232 --> 01:19:30.700
than they do about
Norwegian cultural sensibilities.

01:19:30.735 --> 01:19:37.232
Resentment towards Christianity in Norway goes
back a thousand years to their Viking ancestors.

01:19:37.341 --> 01:19:41.715
In any case, the majority of metal fans,
including myself,

01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:45.775
could never understand or
defend these extreme actions.

01:19:51.753 --> 01:19:54.488
I love going to Norway and Denmark.

01:19:54.496 --> 01:19:58.148
Because I love picking up the
black metal magazines.

01:19:58.994 --> 01:20:01.790
It's so Spinal Tap.

01:20:02.230 --> 01:20:06.833
Because each band is trying to be more
wicked and evil than the other band.

01:20:08.337 --> 01:20:12.445
And it's... I can't turn the page without,
you know, "Look at this one!"

01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:14.979
Here's these guys and they're...

01:20:15.014 --> 01:20:16.215
You know, and...

01:20:16.220 --> 01:20:18.415
You know these guys.
When you meet them in the mall,

01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:20.947
they're, "Hello, Mr Cooper.
How are you? Nice to meet you."

01:20:20.952 --> 01:20:23.520
My mother's over there.
Can she have your autograph?"

01:20:23.555 --> 01:20:26.221
And I say,
"I thought you were like Satans. "

01:20:26.256 --> 01:20:29.488
It's like "Well, yeah, we are,
but you know... "

01:20:30.158 --> 01:20:32.332
Very rarely do you meet
anybody that's truly scary.

01:20:32.337 --> 01:20:34.353
DEATH AND VIOLENCE

01:20:37.533 --> 01:20:39.002
30 years ago,

01:20:39.007 --> 01:20:42.501
parents were losing sleep
at night over Alice Cooper.

01:20:42.506 --> 01:20:46.143
Looking back, Alice seems harmless
compared to church burners,

01:20:46.178 --> 01:20:49.306
but in the 70s, people thought
he was actually killing babies

01:20:49.308 --> 01:20:53.518
and executing himself
on stage night after night.

01:20:53.523 --> 01:20:57.311
Well, I mean, I was the...
I was the poster boy for controversy.

01:20:57.352 --> 01:20:59.879
In some ways,
I think I invented it.

01:21:00.656 --> 01:21:05.268
Because we were the first band to get...
We got banned in England.

01:21:05.303 --> 01:21:09.326
We got banned and nobody could
figure out why they were banning us.

01:21:09.504 --> 01:21:13.895
We asked them in London,
"What are we banned for?"

01:21:14.271 --> 01:21:16.238
They couldn't name anything.

01:21:16.273 --> 01:21:19.010
I said,
"Is there any nudity in our show?" "No. "

01:21:19.045 --> 01:21:22.165
"Is there any bad language in our show?"
"No. "

01:21:23.011 --> 01:21:24.916
"So, what are we being banned for?"

01:21:24.951 --> 01:21:28.618
"Well, there's blood in your show. "
Has anybody ever seen Macbeth?

01:21:28.653 --> 01:21:33.192
There was more blood in Macbeth,
and that's required reading in school.

01:21:33.197 --> 01:21:37.865
There was no real definitive rock vampire
that was really the creature of the night.

01:21:37.868 --> 01:21:39.863
That's what Alice was supposed to be.

01:21:39.865 --> 01:21:43.269
If you say, "Welcome to my nightmare, "
you don't just say it, you do it.

01:21:43.304 --> 01:21:47.229
Give them the nightmare.
Show them the nightmare.

01:22:03.561 --> 01:22:05.009
Since Alice Cooper,

01:22:05.014 --> 01:22:07.526
nightmarish images of death
and violence in metal

01:22:07.561 --> 01:22:09.693
have only become more vivid.

01:22:09.728 --> 01:22:13.407
Nowhere is this more prevalent than in
the most extreme sub-genre,

01:22:13.442 --> 01:22:14.798
Death metal.

01:22:14.833 --> 01:22:16.869
Building on thrash
and black metal,

01:22:16.904 --> 01:22:19.340
death metal's ingredients
are guttural vocals,

01:22:19.375 --> 01:22:22.574
machine-gun guitars,
and horrific album art.-

01:22:22.579 --> 01:22:25.944
The most infamous band in this
sub-genre is Cannibal Corpse.

01:22:25.949 --> 01:22:28.847
In Germany, the first three
Cannibal Corpse albums are banned

01:22:28.852 --> 01:22:31.650
Eaten Back to Life, Butchered at Birth, 
and Tomb of the Mutilated.

01:22:31.655 --> 01:22:34.789
Any song from those records
cannot be played by the band live.

01:22:34.824 --> 01:22:37.884
They're also banned
in New Zealand, first three.

01:22:37.919 --> 01:22:41.791
We have to use alternate
covers in Australia.

01:22:41.826 --> 01:22:43.461
A lot of stuff is banned in Korea.

01:22:43.496 --> 01:22:46.701
There's evidence to
demonstrate that a...

01:22:46.736 --> 01:22:50.266
the average young person
growing up today

01:22:50.301 --> 01:22:54.975
sees more violence
through popular culture

01:22:55.010 --> 01:22:59.643
than ever, uh...
would occur in real life.

01:22:59.678 --> 01:23:02.679
This has been marketed often
to young people,

01:23:02.684 --> 01:23:06.009
particularly teenagers,
who won't have the social context.

01:23:06.044 --> 01:23:10.459
They don't have the background
of how violence has informed

01:23:10.494 --> 01:23:12.590
our human condition over the years,

01:23:12.625 --> 01:23:16.862
and so what they're left with is, um...
the glamourisation

01:23:16.897 --> 01:23:20.797
of weapons and violence
as a form of conflict resolution.

01:23:20.832 --> 01:23:24.501
This is a band by the name of
Cannibal Corpse. Have you heard of them?

01:23:24.536 --> 01:23:28.705
And they've been at the centre
of a significant amount of controversy,

01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:32.310
- regarding primarily their artwork.
- Mm-hm.

01:23:32.345 --> 01:23:36.317
This is their latest album, just released,
called The Wretched Spawn.

01:23:36.352 --> 01:23:38.011
Tell me about what you think of that?

01:23:38.013 --> 01:23:42.953
Well, it's uh...
Things are even worse than I thought.

01:23:42.988 --> 01:23:52.118
You've obviously... uncovered some of the
latest "leading edge" examples of...

01:23:52.327 --> 01:23:54.698
what's out there in
the music world.

01:23:54.733 --> 01:23:59.004
I mean, I just can't see
how responsible societies

01:23:59.039 --> 01:24:01.255
could turn a blind eye
to this kind of thing

01:24:01.257 --> 01:24:05.877
being sold and marketed to young people
as a form of harmless entertainment.

01:24:05.882 --> 01:24:09.450
First time somebody who knows
nothing about the death metal scene...

01:24:09.485 --> 01:24:14.916
The first time they see one of our
album covers, it's gonna shock them.

01:24:14.951 --> 01:24:20.624
If it doesn't, then, we're not, you know...
We didn't make a very good album cover.

01:24:20.659 --> 01:24:25.860
It's art. Look at it as art. Yeah,
it's disgusting, but there are lots of things...

01:24:25.895 --> 01:24:29.231
Go to the Vatican and
look at the art there.

01:24:29.266 --> 01:24:33.250
Whew! That's representing something
that's real, that could happen.

01:24:33.285 --> 01:24:37.132
This is... Obviously,
that's never going to happen.

01:24:37.167 --> 01:24:41.167
You know, monsters
aren't gonna come out of...

01:24:41.343 --> 01:24:43.980
aren't gonna rip out of people's bodies
anytime soon, I don't think.

01:24:44.015 --> 01:24:47.856
On the one hand, as you see in lyrics
by a band like Cannibal Corpse,

01:24:47.891 --> 01:24:53.623
there's this fascination with the
possibilities of death and the body.

01:24:53.658 --> 01:24:57.158
On the other hand,
there's this terrifying fear of it.

01:24:57.193 --> 01:25:02.639
There's an almost obsessive desire
to explore that which is dangerous,

01:25:02.641 --> 01:25:08.038
that which is scary, that which points
towards obliteration, formlessness,

01:25:08.073 --> 01:25:13.000
a delight in exploring the body
in its ways of being cut up,

01:25:13.002 --> 01:25:14.714
destroyed and mutilated.

01:25:14.749 --> 01:25:18.682
That's a very primal desire
that we all have.

01:25:18.717 --> 01:25:22.152
There seems to be a
connection between how

01:25:22.187 --> 01:25:24.792
acquainted we are
with our mortality

01:25:24.796 --> 01:25:28.325
and how much we want
to see mortality and death

01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:30.862
expressed in our art and culture.

01:25:30.897 --> 01:25:33.131
If you look back a few generations,

01:25:33.166 --> 01:25:36.867
you'd expect some of
your siblings to have died.

01:25:36.902 --> 01:25:40.939
When they died, they'd be laid out
in the front room, you'd see them there.

01:25:40.974 --> 01:25:45.810
Then you'd probably sit down to a meal where
you'd be eating meat and you will be well aware,

01:25:45.845 --> 01:25:49.948
that this slab, of whatever it was,
had been living breathing a few days back.

01:25:49.983 --> 01:25:52.884
And it might well have
been you that cut its throat.

01:25:52.919 --> 01:25:56.223
You knew that death
is part of the essence of life.

01:25:56.228 --> 01:25:57.911
And as we begun to forget this,

01:25:57.946 --> 01:26:02.521
we seem to crave images of
death and fear more and more.

01:26:02.991 --> 01:26:05.259
I don't really have a good reason why

01:26:05.261 --> 01:26:09.899
I craved images of death
or mutilation when I was younger.

01:26:09.904 --> 01:26:13.435
But I do remember sitting
on the bleachers after school,

01:26:13.470 --> 01:26:20.602
My buddies and I, we used to compete to see who
could come up with the most brutal metal lyric.

01:26:20.607 --> 01:26:24.609
And my favourite was
Autopsy's Charred Remains.

01:26:24.644 --> 01:26:27.482
I'll just read a bit
for you because, uh...

01:26:27.517 --> 01:26:29.418
I think you'll enjoy it.

01:26:29.453 --> 01:26:34.025
<i>Burning from the inside out
Bloody foam spews from your mouth</i>

01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:39.161
<i>Smell the putrid stench of flesh
As it burns you to your death</i>

01:26:39.196 --> 01:26:43.900
Afterwards, we would always
just, like, have a total round of high-fives.

01:26:43.935 --> 01:26:47.240
Like, "Yeah, man, that was fuckin' brutal. "

01:26:47.275 --> 01:26:50.205
I still think this music
is harmless entertainment,

01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:54.452
but a lot of people think that metal lyrics
have a serious affect on kids.

01:26:54.457 --> 01:26:56.014
Over the past 20 years,

01:26:56.049 --> 01:26:59.349
metal artists such as
Judas Priest, Ozzy Osbourne,

01:26:59.384 --> 01:27:03.274
Cannibal Corpse, Slayer,
Marilyn Manson and Slipknot,

01:27:03.309 --> 01:27:08.058
have all come under fire for causing teens
to commit murder or suicide.

01:27:08.063 --> 01:27:12.861
Although none of these cases have
succeeded, the cases keep coming.

01:27:12.896 --> 01:27:16.725
Every time a serial killer
or a mass murderer,

01:27:16.727 --> 01:27:21.869
or a Satanist,
or any evil person in our society...

01:27:21.904 --> 01:27:25.470
Anytime the media's found out that
they've listened to heavy metal music,

01:27:25.473 --> 01:27:30.325
it has been blown up as the reason,
the reason du jour,

01:27:30.327 --> 01:27:33.954
for why this person is doing
the things that they do.

01:27:33.956 --> 01:27:37.623
You know, "Aha!
They were Manson fans, see?

01:27:37.658 --> 01:27:40.481
"That's why they slaughtered all
those kids in high school. "

01:27:40.488 --> 01:27:43.719
American news, especially,
keys in on violence, you know.

01:27:43.721 --> 01:27:48.263
And it's... And they're trying to promote
how wonderful American society is

01:27:48.298 --> 01:27:53.017
and all they show is, "Bloodbath at
high school in Denver", you know.

01:27:53.052 --> 01:27:57.208
And they use that as a byline for
like two, three days, you know.

01:27:57.243 --> 01:28:00.932
And they sucker a lot of people in.
A line we wrote a while back...

01:28:00.934 --> 01:28:02.492
It's in Disciple actually is... 

01:28:02.527 --> 01:28:04.203
"The beauty of death we all adore"

01:28:04.238 --> 01:28:07.182
"'Cause TV sucks you in
And makes you want to see more of it. "

01:28:07.217 --> 01:28:11.050
I do think that it's crazy to argue
that there is no relationship

01:28:11.085 --> 01:28:17.558
between the imagery in metal and, you know,
some teen suicides and some acts of violence.

01:28:17.593 --> 01:28:19.864
Sometimes metal messages
are confusing. I mean,

01:28:19.899 --> 01:28:22.938
The song Suicide Solution is about
drinking yourself to death.

01:28:22.973 --> 01:28:25.223
But I can understand why
a 13-year-old kid,

01:28:25.225 --> 01:28:28.836
might be confused by a song
called Suicide Solution.

01:28:29.170 --> 01:28:34.290
I'm not shocked that some kid listened
to this and committed suicide over it.

01:28:34.309 --> 01:28:37.150
Although, it's weird in the sense that,

01:28:37.155 --> 01:28:41.630
if you're serious enough about Ozzy
Osbourne to kill yourself over his lyrics,

01:28:41.632 --> 01:28:44.556
it seems weird you wouldn't read
the liner notes more closely?

01:28:44.591 --> 01:28:48.375
The most powerful predictor of
whether someone will commit suicide

01:28:48.377 --> 01:28:50.558
is the feeling of helplessness.

01:28:50.593 --> 01:28:53.286
Nobody listens to metal
in order to feel helpless.

01:28:53.321 --> 01:28:57.059
They listen to feel empowered,
and connected with other people.

01:28:57.065 --> 01:28:59.734
That may be empowered
through a song about suicide,

01:28:59.769 --> 01:29:02.704
that makes you realise that
you're not alone, you're not helpless.

01:29:02.739 --> 01:29:05.742
Other people are going through the same
things. You don't need to kill yourself.

01:29:05.777 --> 01:29:10.457
There's times you're sitting there alone,
thinking it can't get much worse than this.

01:29:10.459 --> 01:29:15.987
And you... And you're just looking for
something to help, and music did that.

01:29:16.022 --> 01:29:21.594
It's never saying, you know,
just give up, 'cause I can't buy into that.

01:29:21.629 --> 01:29:24.261
You know, I can't just give up
if I've had a bad day.

01:29:24.296 --> 01:29:28.926
If I've had a really bad day, I'm not gonna go drink
or whatever, I'm not gonna fight someone.

01:29:28.961 --> 01:29:32.397
I'm gonna go home and listen to music,
play some bass.

01:29:37.505 --> 01:29:42.445
We get letters all the time from these kids that
show how much our songs help them,

01:29:42.447 --> 01:29:46.242
and they go home feeling better,
and they can go back to school.

01:29:46.247 --> 01:29:52.691
I have a lot of kids say that when they wear
their Slipknot T-shirts, that they feel safe.

01:29:52.726 --> 01:29:55.557
Violence has been around
a lot longer than we have.

01:29:55.562 --> 01:30:00.864
Unfortunately, the ignorance
of Republican, puritanical thinking is,

01:30:00.899 --> 01:30:04.234
they see a mosh pit, it's violent.
That's all they see.

01:30:04.269 --> 01:30:07.906
Of course, pits can be brutal places,
but at the same time, it's like,

01:30:07.941 --> 01:30:13.441
I'd rather have kids in the pit working out
the stuff they go through in their lives,

01:30:13.476 --> 01:30:17.978
than out hurting other people,
with no optimistic ends.

01:31:17.238 --> 01:31:19.706
Do you want some more?

01:31:20.775 --> 01:31:23.505
Do you want some fuckin' more?

01:31:37.127 --> 01:31:38.327
So here we are,

01:31:38.333 --> 01:31:42.073
35 years after Black Sabbath
first played the devil's note

01:31:42.108 --> 01:31:44.702
and metal culture is still thriving.

01:31:44.707 --> 01:31:49.609
A new generation of fans has emerged,
and the old guard is going strong.

01:31:49.644 --> 01:31:53.078
But I set out on this journey
to answer one question

01:31:53.113 --> 01:31:58.448
Why has heavy metal been consistently
stereotyped, dismissed and condemned?

01:31:58.453 --> 01:32:03.320
What's become clear to me is that
metal confronts what we'd rather ignore.

01:32:03.355 --> 01:32:06.122
It celebrates what we often deny.

01:32:06.157 --> 01:32:09.033
It indulges in what we fear most.

01:32:09.038 --> 01:32:13.325
And that's why metal will always be
a culture of outsiders.

01:32:24.512 --> 01:32:27.915
For young people,
it's a place to belong

01:32:27.950 --> 01:32:31.270
where you can experience
other possibilities

01:32:31.305 --> 01:32:34.921
and transcend everyday life
in a very glorious way.

01:32:34.926 --> 01:32:38.380
And it's a purging.
I think metal performs that task,

01:32:38.415 --> 01:32:42.493
of sort of letting us get rid
of a lot of tension. It's a catharsis.

01:32:42.498 --> 01:32:46.322
You want to have people
get up and start leaping around.

01:32:46.357 --> 01:32:48.165
That's what it's for.

01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:51.000
People in their own way
have different releases.

01:32:51.035 --> 01:32:54.371
It's something
other than your mundane life.

01:32:54.406 --> 01:33:00.046
The idea is that the way people
feel is as important as how they think.

01:33:00.051 --> 01:33:02.645
I don't know why it's important. It just is.

01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:05.917
I think I'm a better person
now that I've been listening to metal.

01:33:05.922 --> 01:33:11.821
It doesn't judge me, it doesn't criticise me.
It's just always there for me. Always.

01:33:11.856 --> 01:33:17.229
For metalheads, good, beauty,
and truth, is up on stage there.

01:33:17.264 --> 01:33:20.081
Is heavy metal a sacrament?
For some people it is.

01:33:20.116 --> 01:33:25.073
If it keeps kids alive, if it gives them hope,
if it gives them a place to belong,

01:33:25.078 --> 01:33:28.911
if it gives them a sense of transcendence,
then I believe it's a spiritual force.

01:33:28.913 --> 01:33:31.731
I believe it's a pipeline to God.

01:34:02.437 --> 01:34:06.244
Ever since I was 12 years old,
I've had to defend my love for heavy metal

01:34:06.249 --> 01:34:10.310
against those who say
it's a less valid form of music.

01:34:10.580 --> 01:34:14.412
My answer now is that you
either feel it or you don't.

01:34:14.548 --> 01:34:18.355
If metal doesn't give you
that overwhelming surge of power

01:34:18.390 --> 01:34:21.344
and make the hair stand up
on the back of your neck,

01:34:21.379 --> 01:34:23.594
you might never get it.

01:34:23.629 --> 01:34:26.427
And you know what? That's OK.

01:34:26.462 --> 01:34:30.099
Because, judging by
the 40,000 metalheads around me,

01:34:30.134 --> 01:34:33.261
we're doing just fine without you.
