WEBVTT

00:02.633 --> 00:04.305
(Meredith) I HAD THIS
MEMORY GAME WHEN I WAS A KID--

00:04.305 --> 00:07.078
A BUNCH OF CARDS
FACEDOWN IN ROWS.

00:07.078 --> 00:08.679
(helicopter blades whirring)
EACH CARD HAS A PICTURE.

00:08.679 --> 00:11.042
YOU TURN ONE OVER,
LOOK AT IT...

00:11.042 --> 00:14.045
(whirring continues)

00:17.118 --> 00:20.221
THEN YOU TURN IT BACK OVER.

00:20.221 --> 00:21.392
(monitor beeping rapidly)

00:21.392 --> 00:23.094
THEN YOU HAVE TO TRY
AND REMEMBER

00:23.094 --> 00:24.395
WHERE ITS MATCHING CARD WAS.

00:24.395 --> 00:27.228
I HAVE TO GET ON A PLANE.
I HAVE TO GET ON A PLANE.

00:27.228 --> 00:29.460
DR. GREY, DR. GREY,
YOU WERE ON A PLANE.

00:29.460 --> 00:32.163
YOU WERE IN A PLANE CRASH.
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU--

00:33.204 --> 00:34.465
(Meredith) DEREK!

00:34.465 --> 00:36.107
(Arizona) AAH!
(joint snaps)

00:36.107 --> 00:37.068
(Meredith) AAH!

00:37.068 --> 00:38.809
MEREDITH, GET UP!

00:38.809 --> 00:40.171
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

00:40.171 --> 00:41.172
WHERE--WHERE'S MY SISTER?

00:41.172 --> 00:43.043
MY SISTER--
WHERE IS LEXIE?

00:43.043 --> 00:44.175
NO, NO, NO, NO.

00:44.175 --> 00:45.576
WHERE--WHERE--WHERE'S MY HUSBAND
AND--AND--AND CRISTINA?

00:45.576 --> 00:47.218
LAY BACK AND RELAX.
I HAVE TO GET--

00:47.218 --> 00:48.179
ALL RIGHT.
I HAVE TO GET TO MY SISTER
AND MY HUSBAND.

00:48.179 --> 00:49.580
ALL RIGHT. HOLD ON.
HOLD ON.

00:49.580 --> 00:50.651
I--MY SISTER.
(woman) HEY,
YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE.

00:50.651 --> 00:52.253
DON'T TELL ME
WHERE I CAN GO.

00:52.253 --> 00:54.455
(Meredith) ...THERE'S AN
INFECTION AND I NEED TO SEE HIM.
MOVE.

00:54.455 --> 00:58.058
AND OTHER TIMES, IT SHOWS US
EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED TO SEE.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.231
DOCTOR, WE'VE GOT THEM.
WE'RE TAKING CARE OF THEM.

01:00.231 --> 01:02.062
HEY.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.664
THAT'S YOUR MAMA.

01:03.664 --> 01:05.366
HEY, HONEY.

01:05.366 --> 01:06.637
OKAY, OKAY.

01:06.637 --> 01:08.139
OKAY, OKAY.

01:08.139 --> 01:09.270
(whispers) YOU SIT HERE.
MAMA'S HERE, BABY.

01:09.270 --> 01:10.601
THERE WE GO.

01:10.601 --> 01:13.144
MAMA'S HERE.
NO.

01:13.144 --> 01:16.177
THE CARDS SEEM COMPLETELY
OUT OF ORDER AND RANDOM,

01:16.177 --> 01:18.479
BUT YOU KEEP TURNING
THEM OVER.

01:18.479 --> 01:21.081
AND THE MORE CARDS YOU SEE...

01:23.784 --> 01:26.617
(monitor beeping steadily)

01:26.617 --> 01:30.521
YOU GET A SENSE OF HOW
EVERYTHING FITS TOGETHER.

01:30.521 --> 01:31.792
HEY.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.164
(clatters)

01:33.164 --> 01:35.526
(exhales)

01:35.526 --> 01:37.728
THEY'RE TAKING US HOME TOMORROW
ON A PLANE.

01:37.728 --> 01:40.331
AND I SAID NO PLANES,
BUT WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE,

01:40.331 --> 01:42.833
BECAUSE OF
MARK AND ARIZONA, SO...

01:42.833 --> 01:45.206
SO I TOLD BAILEY
TO JUST SEDATE US--

01:45.206 --> 01:48.639
SEDATE ALL OF US.

01:51.282 --> 01:54.185
AND WE'LL NEVER KNOW
IT HAPPENED.

01:54.185 --> 01:57.188
(beeping continues)

01:57.188 --> 01:59.490
RIGHT?

01:59.490 --> 02:01.722
CRISTINA?

02:05.256 --> 02:06.897
CRISTINA?

02:06.897 --> 02:09.900
(rumbling)

02:09.900 --> 02:12.903
(monitor beeping steadily)

02:18.269 --> 02:19.910
(rattle)
OH!

02:19.910 --> 02:23.244
I WISH THEY HAD
PUT ME OUT, TOO.

02:23.244 --> 02:24.375
YEAH, I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

02:24.375 --> 02:25.716
ALL I KEEP THINKING IS,

02:25.716 --> 02:27.918
WE'RE GONNA CRASH
ON SOME TROPICAL ISLAND

02:27.918 --> 02:30.551
AND GET ATTACKED
BY A POLAR BEAR.

02:31.882 --> 02:34.785
NOW... I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

02:34.785 --> 02:36.156
(scoffs)

02:36.156 --> 02:37.928
YOU SHOULD WATCH
MORE TV.

02:39.630 --> 02:41.432
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW YOU CAN THINK OF LEAVING.

02:41.432 --> 02:42.933
(Derek)
BECAUSE IT'S HARVARD.

02:42.933 --> 02:44.665
MEREDITH, BECAUSE YOU DON'T
TURN DOWN AN OFFER FROM HARVARD.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.197
YOU HAVE TWO,

02:46.197 --> 02:47.768
MAYBE THREE SURGERIES LEFT
ON YOUR HAND BEFORE--

02:47.768 --> 02:49.270
YOU KNOW WHAT?
MAYBE THEY HAVE DOCTORS THERE.

02:49.270 --> 02:50.671
MAYBE ONE CAN HELP ME.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.643
WITH MARK IN THE CONDITION
HE'S IN, AND CRISTINA?

02:52.643 --> 02:53.804
I'M NOT SAYING
WE LEAVE TOMORROW.

02:53.804 --> 02:55.276
THEY'RE JUST LOOKING
FOR A TIME FRAME.

02:55.276 --> 02:56.577
WELL, I'M SORRY, DEREK.

02:56.577 --> 02:58.849
I KNOW YOU REALLY WANT TO GO.
BUT I CAN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.

02:58.849 --> 03:00.281
THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME.
THIS IS ABOUT YOU.

03:00.281 --> 03:01.312
YOU'RE AT THE BEGINNING
OF YOUR CAREER.

03:01.312 --> 03:02.783
IT'S YOU THEY WANT.

03:02.783 --> 03:04.285
I DON'T KNOW. I'M NOT
THE SAME MAN THAT THEY HIRED.

03:04.285 --> 03:06.257
DON'T SAY THAT.
80%, MEREDITH.

03:06.257 --> 03:07.358
DON'T SAY THAT!

03:07.358 --> 03:08.519
SHH.

03:08.519 --> 03:11.292
(Zola fusses over monitor)

03:11.292 --> 03:13.424
WE STAY HERE,
WE WORK HERE,

03:13.424 --> 03:16.297
WE MOVE INTO THAT BEAUTIFUL
HOUSE THAT YOU BUILT US.

03:16.297 --> 03:17.698
THAT WAS OUR PLAN.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.230
THAT WAS BEFORE YOU GOT
A JOB IN BOSTON.

03:19.230 --> 03:21.372
AND THAT WAS BEFORE
OUR PLANE CRASHED.

03:21.372 --> 03:23.704
MM. BLOWING OFF HARVARD.
WOW.

03:23.704 --> 03:26.607
YOU'RE BLOWING OFF HOPKINS.
WOW.

03:26.607 --> 03:29.209
NO, I'M POSTPONING HOPKINS
TILL ROBBINS IS BETTER.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.342
AVERY DID THE SAME THING
FOR SLOAN.

03:31.342 --> 03:32.683
AND I STAYED.

03:32.683 --> 03:35.246
AND YOU STAYED BECAUSE YOU HAVE
NO PLACE ELSE TO GO.

03:35.246 --> 03:38.349
OH. WAKE ME UP IN TEN
FOR CHUNKY STU.

03:38.349 --> 03:39.520
YOU JUST ATE.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.221
STUART.
SHORT-BOWEL SYNDROME KID.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.953
I'M DOING
AN INTESTINAL TRANSPLANT.

03:42.953 --> 03:44.295
HE PUKED ON ME
THE FIRST TIME WE MET,

03:44.295 --> 03:45.626
SO I CALL HIM "CHUNKY STU."

03:45.626 --> 03:47.328
UGH.

03:47.328 --> 03:49.930
ARIZONA HATED IT, BUT STUART
THINKS IT'S HILARIOUS.

03:49.930 --> 03:52.303
HOW IS ARIZONA'S INFECTION?
IS IT GETTING ANY BETTER?

03:52.303 --> 03:54.305
DON'T KNOW.
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER.

03:54.305 --> 03:56.407
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU'RE RUNNING HER SERVICE.

03:56.407 --> 03:59.270
(scoffs) YOU REALLY THINK
SHE WANTS TO TALK TO ME?

03:59.270 --> 04:00.511
I MEAN, WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO SAY TO HER--

04:00.511 --> 04:02.012
"HEY, REMEMBER THE TIME
THAT I QUIT

04:02.012 --> 04:03.344
"AND YOU GOT PISSED

04:03.344 --> 04:05.015
"AND TOOK MY SEAT
ON A PLANE THAT CRASHED,

04:05.015 --> 04:07.818
"AND NOW YOU'RE TRADING IN YOUR
WHEELIE SNEAKS FOR A PEG LEG?

04:07.818 --> 04:10.481
SORRY. MY BAD"?

04:10.481 --> 04:12.423
HOW ARE WE DOING HERE?

04:12.423 --> 04:14.325
HEY, JACKSON, YOU'RE TALKING
TO SLOAN, RIGHT?

04:14.325 --> 04:16.287
KEEPING HIM UPDATED.

04:16.287 --> 04:17.428
YEAH. NOT ABOUT
WORK STUFF, THOUGH.

04:17.428 --> 04:18.789
HE DOESN'T NEED THAT KIND
OF PRESSURE RIGHT NOW.

04:18.789 --> 04:20.461
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU TWO?

04:20.461 --> 04:22.333
I JUST SAID THAT--

04:22.333 --> 04:23.934
NO, I'M JUST SAYING, THEY'RE
FINE. THEY'RE GONNA BE FINE.

04:23.934 --> 04:25.366
ARIZONA'S
NOT GONNA LOSE HER LEG,

04:25.366 --> 04:26.337
AND SLOAN IS COMING BACK.

04:26.337 --> 04:27.868
THEY'RE COMING BACK.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.340
SO LET'S ACT LIKE IT.

04:31.001 --> 04:32.343
THEY'RE GONNA BE FINE.

04:32.343 --> 04:36.777
WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE FINE.

04:41.482 --> 04:44.715
HOW LONG ARE WE SAYING
THAT THIS IS OKAY?

04:44.715 --> 04:46.857
AS LONG AS SHE NEEDS.

04:46.857 --> 04:50.361
I, FOR ONE,
FIND IT REFRESHING.

04:51.562 --> 04:53.794
THEY SAY, IF YOU DON'T HAVE
SOMETHING NICE TO SAY...

04:53.794 --> 04:55.295
SHE NEVER
HAS ANYTHING NICE TO SAY.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.397
(sighs)

04:58.068 --> 05:01.472
COME ON, YANG. I'M WIDE OPEN.
JUST HIT ME.

05:08.379 --> 05:10.010
I SAID
NO MORE DAMN RESTRAINTS!

05:10.010 --> 05:11.582
LOOK, SHE IS CLEARLY A DANGER.

05:11.582 --> 05:13.644
SHE DOESN'T EVEN
BELONG ON THIS FLOOR.

05:13.644 --> 05:15.346
SHE IS VIOLENT, UNCOMMUNICATIVE,
AND I'M WORRIED--

05:15.346 --> 05:17.348
OH, SHE COMMUNICATED.
SHE JUST HASN'T TALKED YET.

05:17.348 --> 05:20.421
LOOK, THERE IS NOTHING
PHYSICALLY WRONG WITH HER.

05:20.421 --> 05:21.592
SHE BELONGS UP IN PSYCH.

05:21.592 --> 05:23.354
I AM THE CHIEF OF SURGERY
AND HER HUSBAND.

05:23.354 --> 05:24.495
DON'T TELL ME
WHERE SHE BELONGS.

05:24.495 --> 05:26.326
WELL, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
SIR, THAT IS EXACTLY WHY

05:26.326 --> 05:27.928
YOU SHOULDN'T BE MAKING
THIS DECISION.

05:29.500 --> 05:30.561
OKAY.

05:30.561 --> 05:32.433
OKAY. IT'S TIME.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.405
IT'S TIME TO GET UP.

05:34.405 --> 05:36.367
THEY ARE GONNA
TAKE YOU UPSTAIRS

05:36.367 --> 05:38.509
AND THEY'RE GONNA PUMP YOU
FULL OF ANTIPSYCHOTICS.

05:38.509 --> 05:40.471
AND YOU'RE GONNA GO SLACK-JAWED
AND CUCKOO'S NEST

05:40.471 --> 05:42.543
AND YOU'LL NEVER
BE YOU AGAIN.

05:42.543 --> 05:45.676
CRISTINA, PLEASE,
I AM BEGGING YOU. PLEASE.

05:45.676 --> 05:48.549
YOU HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING.

05:48.549 --> 05:50.921
CRISTINA, PLEASE.

05:50.921 --> 05:53.053
DO YOU HEAR ME?

05:53.053 --> 06:02.733
SAY SOMETHING, PLEASE.

06:08.599 --> 06:11.502
(helicopter blades whirring)

06:15.806 --> 06:16.977
AAH!

06:16.977 --> 06:18.809
(Derek screams)

06:18.809 --> 06:21.812
(whirring continues)

06:24.655 --> 06:26.917
(woman, distorted voice)
ALL RIGHT. WHAT'S HIS NAME?

06:26.917 --> 06:28.989
(man, distorted voice)
UH, DEREK.
DEREK, YOU'RE GONNA BE
JUST FINE.

06:28.989 --> 06:30.160
(man, distorted voice)
NURSE,

06:30.160 --> 06:32.122
COULD YOU MOVE THAT IN HERE,
PLEASE?

06:33.494 --> 06:34.965
HOW SALVAGEABLE
IS THAT HAND?

06:34.965 --> 06:37.428
I'M A SURGEON.

06:37.428 --> 06:39.800
WHAT WAS THAT?
DID YOU GET THAT?

06:39.800 --> 06:41.932
NO.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

06:41.932 --> 06:43.504
WE'RE GONNA TAKE
GOOD CARE OF YOU.

06:43.504 --> 06:44.905
(hisses)

06:44.905 --> 06:46.406
(Callie) THERE WAS DAMAGE TO
THE SECOND METACARPAL,

06:46.406 --> 06:47.908
BUT THE FIRST M.C.P. JOINT
WAS COMPLETELY CRUSHED,

06:47.908 --> 06:49.480
SO BOISE DID AN X-FIX.

06:49.480 --> 06:51.782
I REVISED IT
TO AN INTERNAL FIXATOR.

06:51.782 --> 06:53.614
AND THEN I REMOVED
A LOT OF SCAR TISSUE

06:53.614 --> 06:54.945
SO THERE WOULDN'T BE
CONTRACTURES.

06:54.945 --> 06:56.687
UH--
MM-HMM. SMART.

06:56.687 --> 06:58.188
OH, THANK YOU. THANKS.

06:58.188 --> 06:59.550
DID YOU SEE HOW I, UH--

06:59.550 --> 07:01.091
NO, NO, YOUR WORK
IS--IS GREAT.

07:01.091 --> 07:03.854
UM, DEREK, IT'S THE, UM,
NERVE DAMAGE

07:03.854 --> 07:05.626
THAT I'LL CONCERN MYSELF WITH.

07:05.626 --> 07:06.797
MM-HMM.

07:06.797 --> 07:08.058
AND IT LOOKS LIKE
A PRETTY EASY FIX.

07:08.058 --> 07:10.901
YOU KNOW, THAT'LL GET YOU
YOUR PREHENSILE STRENGTH BACK.

07:10.901 --> 07:12.202
THAT'LL GET YOU THIS BACK.

07:12.202 --> 07:14.104
WHICH WILL GET ME
BACK INTO THE O.R.

07:14.104 --> 07:15.636
THAT'S... THE HOPE.

07:15.636 --> 07:16.907
WELL, THAT'S THE POINT.

07:16.907 --> 07:18.769
I-ISN'T IT?

07:18.769 --> 07:19.870
OF COURSE.

07:19.870 --> 07:21.912
BUT YOUR HAND
WAS BADLY DAMAGED.

07:21.912 --> 07:23.644
AND I THINK CONSERVATIVELY,

07:23.644 --> 07:26.477
I CAN GET YOU BACK
TO 80% FUNCTION.

07:26.477 --> 07:29.880
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

07:32.953 --> 07:35.786
(sighs) MEREDITH,
I CAN TEACH,

07:35.786 --> 07:37.488
CONSULT.

07:37.488 --> 07:39.890
I JUST MAY NEVER
DO ANOTHER SURGERY.

07:39.890 --> 07:42.232
OH, DON'T TALK LIKE THAT.

07:45.996 --> 07:48.098
MEREDITH...

07:48.098 --> 07:50.701
I'M ALIVE.

07:50.701 --> 07:53.143
WE SURVIVED.

07:53.143 --> 07:55.976
ZOLA HAS BOTH HER PARENTS.

07:57.848 --> 07:59.510
I KNOW.

07:59.510 --> 08:03.013
THAT'S ENOUGH.

08:03.013 --> 08:04.955
MENINGIOMA.

08:04.955 --> 08:07.157
PATIENT IS FEMALE,
44 YEARS OLD.

08:07.157 --> 08:08.689
IT'S A TRICKY SPOT.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.160
IT'S RIGHT UP AGAINST
THE SAGITTAL SINUS.

08:10.160 --> 08:11.692
WHICH IS WHY I SUGGESTED

08:11.692 --> 08:13.994
DR. RAMSEY SEE
WHAT YOU MIGHT DO.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.597
NO RADIOSURGERY.
I'D CUT IT OUT.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.669
RIGHT, BUT WITH TWO
DRAINING VEINS IN THE WAY,

08:18.669 --> 08:20.671
IT MIGHT BE SAFER
TO SEE HOW SHE RESPONDS--

08:20.671 --> 08:22.502
THIS WOMAN'S GONNA LIVE
FOR ANOTHER 40 YEARS.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.905
THE TUMOR CAN RECUR
TOO EASILY.

08:24.905 --> 08:27.077
YOU NEED TO DISSECT
THE TWO DRAINING VEINS CLEAR

08:27.077 --> 08:29.910
AND APPROACH IT
FROM THIS DIRECTION.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.011
YOU GET IT ALL,
SHE'S CURED.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.883
WELL, THAT'S MUCH SEXIER,
ISN'T IT?

08:32.883 --> 08:34.545
THAT'S WHY
WE KEEP HIM AROUND.

08:34.545 --> 08:36.917
THANKS, SHEPHERD. I'D BE
HAPPY TO HAVE YOU JOIN ME...

08:36.917 --> 08:38.719
(clears throat)

08:38.719 --> 08:40.921
OR IF YOU'D LIKE
TO OBSERVE.

08:40.921 --> 08:44.024
I, UM... PROBABLY HAVE
A CLASS TO TEACH.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.225
GOOD LUCK.

08:45.225 --> 08:47.227
(telephone ringing)

08:47.227 --> 08:49.059
SHE'S RIGHT.

08:49.059 --> 08:50.761
YOU'RE INVALUABLE.

08:50.761 --> 08:52.803
MM.

08:52.803 --> 08:54.264
(Ramsey) GREAT.

08:54.264 --> 08:55.936
OH, HEY, DR. SHEPHERD.

08:55.936 --> 08:58.008
THIS IS PRETTY COOL.

08:58.008 --> 09:00.040
DR. RAMSEY'S GOT A MENINGIOMA
INVADING THE SAGITTAL SINUS.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.772
SHE WAS GONNA DO IT
RADIOSURGICALLY

09:01.772 --> 09:03.243
BUT DECIDED TO GO AFTER
THE WHOLE THING.

09:03.243 --> 09:04.615
OH, IS THAT SO?

09:04.615 --> 09:05.916
YEAH. SHE JUST FREED
THE FIRST DRAINING VEIN.

09:05.916 --> 09:07.948
YEAH, I GOT IT, ROSS.
THANKS.

09:07.948 --> 09:09.850
THERE'S BLEEDING ON THE SINUS.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.121
SUCTION.

09:11.121 --> 09:13.083
COTTONOIDS.
(suction gurgling)

09:13.083 --> 09:15.125
OKAY, LET'S PUT THE HEAD
OF THE TABLE UP.
(monitor beeping rapidly)

09:15.125 --> 09:17.728
NO, NO, NO, NO.
GET THE HEAD DOWN.

09:17.728 --> 09:18.889
B.P. IS 90 OVER 50.

09:18.889 --> 09:20.030
C.O.2 IS DOWN TO 22.

09:20.030 --> 09:22.032
ALL RIGHT, GET THE HEAD DOWN.
MOVE IT DOWN.

09:22.032 --> 09:23.093
SHE'S SUCKING IN AIR.
YOU HAVE AN AIR EMBOLUS.

09:23.093 --> 09:24.795
BOKI, BULB IRRIGATE THE FIELD.

09:24.795 --> 09:26.737
MAKE SURE NO MORE AIR
GETS IN THERE. SEAL IT OFF.

09:26.737 --> 09:28.899
THANK YOU, DR. SHEPHERD.
THAT WAS, UH--

09:28.899 --> 09:30.070
ALL RIGHT, YOU HAVE A HOLE
IN THE SINUS

09:30.070 --> 09:31.041
YOU NEED TO TAKE CARE OF.

09:31.041 --> 09:32.202
YES, YES.

09:32.202 --> 09:33.573
YOU HAVE TO CAREFULLY
REAPPROXIMATE

09:33.573 --> 09:34.745
THE EDGES
OF THE PATCH GRAFT.

09:34.745 --> 09:35.946
I'LL JUST SEAL IT
WITH A CLIP.

09:35.946 --> 09:37.007
NO, DON'T. THAT COULD
OCCLUDE THE SINUS.

09:37.007 --> 09:39.349
THERE. SEE?
BLEEDING STOPPED.

09:39.349 --> 09:40.711
(monitor beeping erratically)

09:40.711 --> 09:41.982
OH, B.P.'s 210 OVER 130.

09:41.982 --> 09:43.984
VENOUS INFARCTION.
VENTRICULOSTOMY TUBE NOW.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.886
SHE'S CODING.

09:45.886 --> 09:46.987
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

09:46.987 --> 09:48.689
YOU DIDN'T FORCE HER
TO TRY YOUR APPROACH.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.060
IF SHE COULDN'T PULL IT OFF,
WELL, THEN--

09:50.060 --> 09:51.591
I COULD'VE PULLED IT OFF
HAD I BEEN IN THERE.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.923
WELL,
YOU'LL BE BACK IN THERE.

09:52.923 --> 09:54.094
NO, I WON'T.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.225
I WILL BE THE FORMER
NEUROSURGEON DEREK SHEPHERD,

09:55.225 --> 09:56.326
RESEARCH LIBRARIAN.

09:56.326 --> 09:58.969
SHUT UP.
MARK, THE GUY GAVE ME 80%.

09:58.969 --> 10:01.371
WELL, GET BACK TO 100%.
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

10:01.371 --> 10:04.174
DON'T GIVE ME THAT CRAP.
YOU LOVE A HOPELESS CASE.

10:04.174 --> 10:06.877
IT'S TRUE. IT'S THE ONLY REASON
WE'RE STILL FRIENDS.

10:06.877 --> 10:08.108
I'M GLAD
YOU'RE DOING BETTER.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.239
ME, TOO.

10:09.239 --> 10:10.941
YOU WILL BE, TOO.

10:10.941 --> 10:12.012
100%, YOU'LL SEE.

10:14.044 --> 10:15.385
YEAH, COMING ALONG.

10:15.385 --> 10:16.917
X-RAY SHOWS
EXCELLENT ALIGNMENT.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.388
I HEAR SCHACHTER
MOVED YOUR SURGERY UP.

10:18.388 --> 10:19.920
YEAH, COUPLE DAYS.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.051
WELL, FINGERS CROSSED.
OH.

10:21.051 --> 10:22.222
OHH, SORRY.

10:22.222 --> 10:23.393
(laughs)

10:23.393 --> 10:24.855
THAT WAS...

10:24.855 --> 10:26.256
NO, IT'S OKAY.
IT'S FINE. I GET IT.

10:26.256 --> 10:28.729
SO I HAD A LOOK AT, UH,
SCHACHTER'S PLAN.

10:28.729 --> 10:32.062
HE'S OPTED FOR
AN END-TO-END REPAIR.

10:32.062 --> 10:33.664
(indistinct conversations)

10:33.664 --> 10:34.965
WHAT'D YOU THINK?

10:34.965 --> 10:36.106
IT'S GOOD.

10:36.106 --> 10:37.107
OH, IT'S GREAT.
HE'S AMAZING.

10:37.107 --> 10:38.238
HE'S THE BEST, RIGHT?

10:38.238 --> 10:40.270
BUT?
BUT NOTHING.

10:40.270 --> 10:42.012
IT'S JUST THAT I'VE--
I'VE BEEN IN THERE.

10:42.012 --> 10:43.714
I'VE SEEN THE AMOUNT
OF GAP IN THE NERVE,

10:43.714 --> 10:45.045
AND I KNOW IT'S MESSIER,

10:45.045 --> 10:46.917
BUT I THOUGHT A NERVE GRAFT
MIGHT BE BETTER.

10:46.917 --> 10:48.218
THAT'S ALL.

10:48.218 --> 10:50.120
I'M SURE HE'S--HE'S THOUGHT
OF IT ALREADY.

10:50.120 --> 10:51.752
UH, HE'S THE BEST.

10:51.752 --> 10:53.824
WELL, THAT WOULD BE--

10:53.824 --> 10:58.158
BE MUCH RISKIER.
YOU'RE RIGHT, IT IS.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.860
BUT IT COULD MEAN
A FULL RECOVERY.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.191
YOU COULD USE YOUR OWN
A.I.N. FOR THE GRAFT.

11:01.191 --> 11:02.392
I'VE USED IT BEFORE.

11:02.392 --> 11:03.994
IT'S PRACTICALLY GIFT-WRAPPED
FOR A MEDIAN NERVE GRAFT.

11:03.994 --> 11:05.135
YEAH, BUT IF THE GRAFT
DOESN'T TAKE,

11:05.135 --> 11:06.666
WE SHORTEN THE NERVE MORE.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.799
I COULD LOSE MORE FUNCTION
THAN I HAVE NOW.

11:08.799 --> 11:10.140
YOU'RE RIGHT. IT'S STUPID.

11:10.140 --> 11:11.271
THAT'S WHY
SCHACHTER'S NOT DOING IT.

11:11.271 --> 11:13.704
HE'S SMART NOT TO...

11:13.704 --> 11:15.275
WHICH IS WHY YOU SHOULD.

11:15.275 --> 11:17.347
WHAT?

11:17.347 --> 11:19.279
I WANT YOU
TO DO THE SURGERY.

11:19.279 --> 11:21.111
NO.

11:21.111 --> 11:22.412
NO.

11:24.715 --> 11:27.718
(monitor beeping steadily)

11:35.866 --> 11:37.768
OKAY, GRAFT, PLEASE.

11:37.768 --> 11:39.770
HERE YOU GO, DOCTOR.

11:41.071 --> 11:43.003
(sighs)

11:43.003 --> 11:44.074
PERFECT.

11:44.074 --> 11:47.107
THIS LOOKS...

11:47.107 --> 11:49.079
PERFECT. (chuckles)

11:51.111 --> 11:52.883
IT'S ARIZONA.
THERE'S A PROBLEM.

12:00.851 --> 12:03.854
(helicopter blades whirring)

12:17.437 --> 12:19.469
WATCH THAT LINE.
HOLD HER.
GET SOME RESTRAINTS.

12:19.469 --> 12:21.872
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
SEND--OW! DAMN IT!

12:21.872 --> 12:23.213
ALL RIGHT, I GOT IT.
(man) I'VE GOT IT.

12:23.213 --> 12:25.876
2 OF LORAZEPAM NOW! NOW!
THERE'S THE RESTRAINTS.

12:25.876 --> 12:27.517
CALM DOWN.
EASY.

12:27.517 --> 12:30.480
CALM DOWN.
OKAY. OKAY.
(speaks indistinctly)

12:30.480 --> 12:32.352
THE COMBINATION
OF EXTREME EXHAUSTION,

12:32.352 --> 12:33.884
DEHYDRATION, AND EXPOSURE

12:33.884 --> 12:36.356
SEEMS TO HAVE PUT HER
IN A STATE.

12:36.356 --> 12:37.527
(Richard)
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

12:37.527 --> 12:39.229
WE THINK
IT'S REACTIVE PSYCHOSIS.

12:39.229 --> 12:40.490
SHE'S UNRESPONSIVE,

12:40.490 --> 12:42.292
AND THEN WHEN WE GO
TO EXAMINE HER,

12:42.292 --> 12:44.364
SHE BECOMES... VIOLENT.

12:44.364 --> 12:45.435
I'M HERE, OKAY?

12:45.435 --> 12:46.967
I WOULDN'T DO THAT.

12:46.967 --> 12:48.138
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

12:48.138 --> 12:49.539
WHOA.

12:49.539 --> 12:51.401
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

12:51.401 --> 12:53.343
CRISTINA.
I'M GONNA HELP YOU.

12:53.343 --> 12:55.876
CRISTINA, I AM GONNA HELP YOU.
I'M GONNA HELP YOU.

12:55.876 --> 12:59.109
I'M HERE.
CRISTINA, I'M HERE. I'M HERE.

12:59.109 --> 13:00.550
CRISTINA, I'M HERE NOW.

13:00.550 --> 13:02.813
IT'S OKAY.
I'M GONNA HELP YOU.

13:02.813 --> 13:05.015
SHH.

13:08.989 --> 13:11.992
(loud dripping,
monitor beeping steadily)

13:14.064 --> 13:18.068
(speaking indistinctly
with distorted voice)

13:18.068 --> 13:21.071
(discordant chords tinkling,
liquid whooshing)

13:26.006 --> 13:29.840
(distorted voice)
WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE FINE.

13:29.840 --> 13:32.342
(distorted voice) HOW LONG ARE
WE SAYING THAT THIS IS OKAY?

13:32.342 --> 13:34.915
AS LONG AS SHE NEEDS.

13:34.915 --> 13:37.547
(distorted voice) I, FOR ONE,
FIND IT REFRESHING.

13:39.189 --> 13:41.021
SO SHE DOESN'T SPEAK
AT ALL?

13:41.021 --> 13:42.492
SHE HASN'T YET.

13:42.492 --> 13:44.855
SHE JUST STARES...

13:44.855 --> 13:47.197
AND BREATHES.

13:47.197 --> 13:48.528
IT'S KIND OF WEIRD,

13:48.528 --> 13:51.862
BUT THE WAY THAT THEY
TALK ABOUT HER AROUND HERE,

13:51.862 --> 13:54.234
IT'S LIKE SHE'S A LEGEND,
YOU KNOW?

13:54.234 --> 13:57.407
MM. AND NOW
SHE'S LIKE AN END TABLE.

13:57.407 --> 13:58.869
(interns chuckle)

13:58.869 --> 14:00.570
SHANE, THAT'S HORRIBLE.
STOP IT.

14:00.570 --> 14:02.242
SORRY.

14:02.242 --> 14:04.214
(all gasp)

14:04.214 --> 14:05.515
(shards crash)

14:05.515 --> 14:08.518
(people speaking indistinctly)

14:10.850 --> 14:14.484
I'M GONNA TAKE
A LEAVE OF ABSENCE.

14:14.484 --> 14:17.057
I THINK THREE YEARS AGO,
I SAID I WAS GONNA FIGURE OUT

14:17.057 --> 14:18.858
HOW TO MAKE
A GREAT ROAST CHICKEN.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.291
STILL HAVEN'T DONE IT.
(scoffs)

14:21.291 --> 14:23.263
I JUST LIKE
HOW A HOUSE SMELLS

14:23.263 --> 14:26.296
WHEN THERE'S A CHICKEN
IN THE OVEN.

14:30.100 --> 14:32.542
(sighs)

14:32.542 --> 14:35.005
YOU'RE GONNA FEEL STRONGER
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS

14:35.005 --> 14:37.948
OR WEEKS.

14:37.948 --> 14:40.550
IT TAKES
AS LONG AS IT TAKES.

14:40.550 --> 14:43.313
AND WE HAVE ALL THE TIME
IN THE WORLD.

14:43.313 --> 14:46.556
WHEN YOU'RE BACK ON YOUR FEET,
YOU'LL GO BACK TO WORK

14:46.556 --> 14:49.589
AT WHATEVER PACE
YOU WANT.

14:49.589 --> 14:52.522
YOU'LL GO BACK INTO THE O.R.,
AND YOU CAN DO YOUR MAGIC.

14:52.522 --> 14:56.666
YOU WON'T HAVE TO DEAL
WITH PATIENTS OR FAMILIES.

14:56.666 --> 14:59.629
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF ALL OF THAT.

15:05.175 --> 15:07.607
YOU READY TO GET OUT NOW?

15:09.279 --> 15:11.982
I CAN'T.

15:11.982 --> 15:14.114
WHAT?

15:20.190 --> 15:23.193
I CAN'T GET OUT.

15:23.193 --> 15:24.654
ARE YOU...

15:24.654 --> 15:27.427
YOU CAN. I'LL--
I'LL HELP YOU.

15:30.360 --> 15:34.064
I STAYED AWAKE
FOR FOUR DAYS.

15:36.536 --> 15:39.039
I REMEMBER...

15:39.039 --> 15:43.643
EVERY SINGLE MINUTE
OF THOSE FOUR DAYS.

15:45.215 --> 15:46.977
THE FIRE WENT OUT.

15:46.977 --> 15:50.720
IT WAS REALLY, REALLY DARK.

15:50.720 --> 15:55.155
THERE WERE SO MANY STARS.

15:55.155 --> 16:00.230
I REMEMBER GETTING THE BUGS
OUT OF ARIZONA'S LEG.

16:00.230 --> 16:04.364
I PUT LEAVES ON IT,
TRYING TO KEEP THEM OUT.

16:06.466 --> 16:09.269
AND MARK...

16:09.269 --> 16:12.242
MARK JUST KEPT DYING.

16:12.242 --> 16:14.604
IT WAS SO ANNOYING.

16:14.604 --> 16:16.106
I KEPT TRYING TO HELP HIM,

16:16.106 --> 16:19.479
BUT HE JUST
KEPT TRYING TO DIE ON ME.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.282
I JUST WANTED TO LIE DOWN...

16:22.282 --> 16:26.516
AND SLEEP ON HIM
BECAUSE HE WAS WARM.

16:26.516 --> 16:29.719
AND I WANTED TO SLEEP.

16:31.521 --> 16:35.125
MEREDITH WAS ASLEEP.

16:35.125 --> 16:38.028
EVERYONE WAS ASLEEP.

16:38.028 --> 16:41.031
ARIZONA GOT THE LAST
OF THE WATER,

16:41.031 --> 16:45.575
AND I REMEMBER DRINKING
SOMETHING BAD.

16:45.575 --> 16:49.709
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
THE FUEL FROM THE PLANE?

16:49.709 --> 16:52.442
I DRANK...

16:52.442 --> 16:55.014
MY PEE.

16:56.746 --> 16:59.149
THE NOISES...

17:00.650 --> 17:03.793
THE ANIMAL NOISES...

17:03.793 --> 17:06.656
FIGHTING AND GROWLING
RIGHT...

17:06.656 --> 17:10.660
NEXT TO US, RIGHT THERE.

17:10.660 --> 17:13.433
I KEPT WAITING FOR THEM
TO COME AND KILL ME,

17:13.433 --> 17:16.806
BUT THEY DIDN'T.

17:16.806 --> 17:20.170
AND THEN I REALIZED...

17:20.170 --> 17:22.742
THEY WERE FIGHTING
OVER LEXIE.

17:28.078 --> 17:31.151
I TRIED TO KEEP THEM OFF
OF HER.

17:31.151 --> 17:33.283
I TRIED.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.527
BUT I COULDN'T GET OUT.

17:37.527 --> 17:40.430
I CAN'T GET OUT.

17:41.761 --> 17:45.295
YOU'RE OUT NOW.

17:45.295 --> 17:47.237
I'VE GOT YOU.

17:47.237 --> 17:49.199
YOU HEAR ME?

17:49.199 --> 17:50.800
(inhales)

17:50.800 --> 17:55.245
I CAN'T GET OUT.

17:55.245 --> 17:58.748
DON'T YOU SEE?

17:58.748 --> 18:02.352
I'LL NEVER GET OUT.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.190
YOU OKAY?

18:10.190 --> 18:12.122
YEP.

18:12.122 --> 18:13.293
YOU SURE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

18:13.293 --> 18:15.765
YES. IT'S ONE HIGHWAY
ALL THE WAY TO MINNESOTA--

18:15.765 --> 18:18.128
THROUGH MONTANA,
CROSS ONE OF THE DAKOTAS,

18:18.128 --> 18:19.699
I CAN'T REMEMBER WHICH.

18:19.699 --> 18:20.800
NO, I MEANT BY LEAVING.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.572
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE OKAY WITH IT?

18:22.572 --> 18:24.204
ARE YOU SURE
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO?

18:24.204 --> 18:26.206
MEREDITH, NOT YOU, TOO.
OWEN JUST TRIED TO--

18:26.206 --> 18:28.708
WELL, YEAH, BECAUSE I'M WORRIED
THAT YOU'RE JUST RUNNING AWAY.

18:28.708 --> 18:31.441
WELL, YEAH, I AM. I'M FLEEING,
LIKE BAMBI FROM A FOREST FIRE,

18:31.441 --> 18:34.214
AND SO SHOULD YOU, 'CAUSE
HORRIBLE THINGS HAPPEN HERE.

18:34.214 --> 18:35.545
NO,
SOMETHING HORRIBLE HAPPENED,

18:35.545 --> 18:36.886
AND WE SHOULD STICK TOGETHER.

18:36.886 --> 18:38.388
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE HAVE STUCK TOGETHER.

18:38.388 --> 18:40.650
AND WE'VE GROWN TOGETHER,
LIKE TWO GNARLED TREES

18:40.650 --> 18:43.153
TWINING AROUND EACH OTHER,
TRYING TO SURVIVE.

18:43.153 --> 18:44.854
SURVIVE WHAT?
CRISTINA, THIS IS LIFE.

18:44.854 --> 18:47.727
BAD THINGS HAPPEN.
IT'S HARD.

18:47.727 --> 18:48.858
YOU FIND YOUR PEOPLE,

18:48.858 --> 18:50.300
YOU FIND YOUR PERSON,
AND YOU LEAN ON THEM.

18:50.300 --> 18:51.631
OH, GOD LOVE YOU, MER.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.303
YOU KNOW, SO MANY HORRIBLE
THINGS HAVE HAPPENED TO YOU,

18:53.303 --> 18:54.864
AND MAYBE YOU'RE OKAY
WITH IT,

18:54.864 --> 18:56.906
BUT YOU SHOULDN'T BE.

18:56.906 --> 18:58.668
GO TO HARVARD,

18:58.668 --> 19:00.170
ANYWHERE EXCEPT HERE,

19:00.170 --> 19:01.841
SEEING YOUR DEAD SISTER
AROUND EVERY CORNER.

19:01.841 --> 19:04.874
HEY, YOUR MOTHER DIED HERE.
YOUR HUSBAND WAS SHOT HERE.

19:04.874 --> 19:06.416
GEORGE DIED HERE.

19:06.416 --> 19:08.418
IT'S MY LIFE, AND YOU WERE
HERE FOR IT, TOO.

19:08.418 --> 19:10.420
I MEAN, NOW YOU SOUND LIKE
THE SAME SCARY LONER BITCH

19:10.420 --> 19:12.422
WHO RODE IN HERE ON A MOTORCYCLE
FIVE YEARS AGO.
(sighs)

19:12.422 --> 19:14.884
LIKE THE PAST FIVE YEARS
HAS NEVER HAPPENED?

19:14.884 --> 19:16.186
WELL, YOU KNOW, A PART OF ME
WISHES IT HADN'T.

19:16.186 --> 19:17.827
OH, OKAY. WELL, THEN YOU SHOULD
JUST GO THEN.

19:17.827 --> 19:19.929
AND YOU SHOULD NOT LOOK BACK.
GO.

19:19.929 --> 19:21.461
MEREDITH--

19:21.461 --> 19:22.862
NO, YOU KNOW, CRISTINA, YOU'RE
RIGHT. I'M NOT YOUR PERSON.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.394
AND OWEN ISN'T YOUR PERSON.

19:24.394 --> 19:26.866
YOUR PERSON IS YOU,
AND IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN.

19:31.170 --> 19:34.304
(engine turns over)

19:41.751 --> 19:42.752
(helicopter blades whirring)

19:42.752 --> 19:45.615
(monitor beeping steadily)

19:45.615 --> 19:48.618
What the hell did they do
to this guy out there?

19:50.690 --> 19:53.693
(beeping continues)

19:58.868 --> 20:01.531
HOLD MY HAND.

20:01.531 --> 20:02.972
(Lexie gasps)

20:02.972 --> 20:05.475
(monitor continues beeping)

20:05.475 --> 20:07.777
(alarm sounding)
He's bradying down.

20:07.777 --> 20:09.409
(alarm continues sounding)

20:09.409 --> 20:11.881
(man, distorted voice)
CHARGE. CLEAR.

20:11.881 --> 20:13.413
(paddles thunk)

20:13.413 --> 20:14.584
(monitor beeping erratically)

20:14.584 --> 20:16.316
YEAH, I GOT A PULSE.

20:16.316 --> 20:18.488
(speaks indistinctly)

20:18.488 --> 20:20.219
CLEAR.
(thunk)

20:20.219 --> 20:21.751
I FLEW TO BOISE.

20:21.751 --> 20:24.454
I-I WAS THERE,
BUT THEY WOULDN'T LET ME IN.

20:24.454 --> 20:26.896
THEY SAID I WASN'T FAMILY.

20:26.896 --> 20:29.499
IT'S NOT FAIR.

20:29.499 --> 20:31.401
YOU DON'T DESERVE...

20:33.303 --> 20:34.634
(exhales)

20:34.634 --> 20:36.606
YOU DESERVE BETTER.

20:36.606 --> 20:39.739
SHH. STOP IT.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.672
I'M HERE.

20:42.672 --> 20:46.446
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE,
MARK.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.978
I LOVE YOU.

20:48.978 --> 20:52.782
(sighs deeply)

20:54.384 --> 20:56.456
I LOVE LEXIE.

20:58.688 --> 21:00.660
LOVED.

21:02.662 --> 21:04.934
I'M SORRY.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.771
(monitor beeping steadily)

21:11.771 --> 21:15.345
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

21:15.345 --> 21:17.877
(whispers) CALLIE.

21:17.877 --> 21:19.779
CALLIE.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.280
GO HOME.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.513
NO, I'M ALL RIGHT.

21:23.513 --> 21:25.785
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.457
YOU'VE BEEN UP
FOR THE PAST TWO NIGHTS

21:27.457 --> 21:29.689
BOUNCING BETWEEN
ARIZONA'S ROOM AND HERE.

21:29.689 --> 21:31.361
I JUST NEED SOME COFFEE.
CAN YOU, UM...

21:31.361 --> 21:32.822
CAN YOU STAY WITH HIM
WHILE I RUN TO THE CAFETERIA?

21:32.822 --> 21:34.664
I'LL STAY WITH HIM
ALL NIGHT.

21:37.827 --> 21:40.900
(exhales) I JUST FEEL LIKE
WE'RE LOSING HIM, DEREK.

21:40.900 --> 21:43.873
USUALLY WHEN I TALK TO HIM,
I SENSE THAT HE'S THERE,

21:43.873 --> 21:47.306
THAT HE'S LISTENING,
BUT I THINK HE'S GIVING UP.

21:47.306 --> 21:48.638
(sighs) I'M SO SCARED,

21:48.638 --> 21:49.979
THE SECOND I LEAVE
THIS HOSPITAL,

21:49.979 --> 21:51.781
I'M GONNA GET A PHONE CALL
THAT HE'S DEAD.

21:51.781 --> 21:53.543
THAT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN TONIGHT.

21:55.945 --> 21:56.916
PROMISE?

21:56.916 --> 21:58.588
MM-HMM.

21:58.588 --> 22:00.990
IF HE STARTS GOING SOUTH,
I'LL TELL HIM TO CUT IT OUT.

22:00.990 --> 22:01.951
(chuckles)

22:01.951 --> 22:03.853
HE IDOLIZES ME.
MM.

22:03.853 --> 22:05.995
HE'LL DO WHATEVER I SAY.

22:05.995 --> 22:07.927
THANK YOU.

22:12.862 --> 22:15.665
(exhales deeply)

22:18.938 --> 22:22.572
YOU HEARD WHAT I TOLD HER.

22:22.572 --> 22:25.915
DON'T MAKE ME LOOK LIKE
AN ASS.

22:25.915 --> 22:27.847
PULL IT TOGETHER.

22:27.847 --> 22:30.920
A LOT OF PEOPLE
COUNTING ON YOU.

22:32.021 --> 22:33.923
DAMN IT. I KNEW
I SHOULDN'T HAVE GONE HOME.

22:33.923 --> 22:36.355
IS HE OKAY? DID HE CODE?

22:36.355 --> 22:37.757
JUST COME SEE.

22:37.757 --> 22:38.928
OH, GOD.
WHERE THE HELL IS SHEPHERD?

22:38.928 --> 22:40.830
AVERY, TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON.

22:40.830 --> 22:42.562
TORRES.

22:42.562 --> 22:43.963
WHERE YOU BEEN?

22:43.963 --> 22:46.836
(laughs)

22:46.836 --> 22:47.937
(telephone rings)

22:47.937 --> 22:49.499
PRETTY AMAZING RECOVERY,
RIGHT?

22:49.499 --> 22:50.900
YEAH, HIS SATs ARE GOOD?

22:50.900 --> 22:52.101
HE'S BEING
WEANED OFF PRESSORS?

22:52.101 --> 22:53.803
YEAH, B.P. IS 110 OVER 60.

22:53.803 --> 22:55.805
AND HE'S MAKING INAPPROPRIATE
SEXUAL COMMENTS TO BROOKS.

22:55.805 --> 22:58.077
(chuckles) IT'S FINE.

22:58.077 --> 22:59.779
(chuckles)
NO, IT'S--IT'S NOT.

22:59.779 --> 23:01.611
BUT, UH, RIGHT NOW I'M REALLY,
REALLY ENJOYING IT, SO...

23:01.611 --> 23:02.782
MM.

23:02.782 --> 23:04.083
(Callie laughs)

23:04.083 --> 23:07.957
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

23:07.957 --> 23:09.619
(door closes)

23:09.619 --> 23:11.791
YOU THINK IT'S THE SURGE.

23:11.791 --> 23:13.423
MM. IT--IT MIGHT BE.

23:13.423 --> 23:15.094
I DON'T.
I DON'T THINK IT IS.

23:15.094 --> 23:16.766
WHAT'S THE SURGE?

23:16.766 --> 23:18.167
IN MANY
TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS,

23:18.167 --> 23:20.430
THEY HAVE A FINAL SURGE
OF ENERGY.

23:20.430 --> 23:22.171
THEY GET BETTER
BEFORE THEY GET WORSE.

23:22.171 --> 23:24.103
BUT THIS IS NOT THAT.

23:24.103 --> 23:26.936
BUT IN A LITTLE WHILE,
HE'LL DO WHAT ALL PATIENTS DO.

23:26.936 --> 23:28.077
(Callie and Mark laugh)

23:28.077 --> 23:29.609
HE'LL HAVE EPIPHANIES,

23:29.609 --> 23:30.940
HE'LL TELL YOU WHAT
REALLY MATTERS IN LIFE,

23:30.940 --> 23:32.442
ASK FOR HIS FAMILY.

23:32.442 --> 23:34.444
THE MAN IS TELLING DIRTY JOKES.
IT'S NOT A--NOT A SURGE.

23:34.444 --> 23:36.986
(laughs) NO,
I DON'T THINK SO EITHER.

23:36.986 --> 23:38.648
(speaks inaudibly)

23:38.648 --> 23:40.890
UH, I HAVE A FACIAL LAC.

23:40.890 --> 23:42.792
UH, OH, I HAD A CONSULT
THIS MORNING--

23:42.792 --> 23:44.924
BREAST AUGMENTATION,
"B" TO "D."

23:44.924 --> 23:46.456
DID YOU TELL HER

23:46.456 --> 23:47.927
HER BREASTS WERE BEAUTIFUL
THE WAY THEY ARE?

23:47.927 --> 23:49.799
NO, I STILL THINK
THAT'S WEIRD.

23:49.799 --> 23:51.761
WELL, I KNOW YOU DO,
BUT YOU'RE WRONG.
(chair rattles)

23:51.761 --> 23:53.803
YOU TELL HER SHE'S BEAUTIFUL
JUST THE WAY SHE IS,

23:53.803 --> 23:54.964
AND IF SHE BELIEVES YOU,

23:54.964 --> 23:55.935
YOU'VE SAVED SOMEONE

23:55.935 --> 23:57.667
AN UNNECESSARY
SURGICAL PROCEDURE.

23:57.667 --> 23:59.809
AND THAT IS DEFINITELY NOT
HOW I TALK TO PATIENT.

23:59.809 --> 24:02.612
NO, BUT IT'S HOW YOU TALK
TO A WOMAN, AVERY.

24:02.612 --> 24:04.073
WE'RE IN THE BUSINESS

24:04.073 --> 24:06.115
OF MAKING PEOPLE FEEL BETTER
ABOUT THEMSELVES.

24:06.115 --> 24:08.117
AGAIN,
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU TALK,

24:08.117 --> 24:09.949
I FEEL LIKE
A MALE PROSTITUTE.

24:09.949 --> 24:12.922
SHE'S A PERSON ON THE PRECIPICE
OF CHANGE, AVERY.

24:12.922 --> 24:14.924
SHE'S SCARED
AND SHE'S WORRIED.

24:14.924 --> 24:17.957
GOD, THE THINGS
WE WORRY ABOUT.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.829
SO POINTLESS.

24:19.829 --> 24:21.961
AND WE GET TO HELP TAKE
THAT WORRY AWAY.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.092
IT'S WHY WE'RE DOCTORS.

24:23.092 --> 24:24.694
IT'S ACTUALLY
WHY WE'RE PEOPLE,

24:24.694 --> 24:28.137
BUT SOMEHOW WE FORGET THAT
ALL THAT MATTERS IS PEOPLE.

24:28.137 --> 24:31.571
AND WHETHER WE WALK AWAY
LEAVING THEM BETTER OR WORSE

24:31.571 --> 24:33.603
FOR HAVING MET US.

24:33.603 --> 24:35.474
WE CONTROL THAT, AVERY.

24:35.474 --> 24:39.579
I WANT YOU
TO PROMISE ME SOMETHING.

24:39.579 --> 24:42.011
IF YOU LOVE SOMEONE,

24:42.011 --> 24:44.083
YOU TELL 'EM.

24:44.083 --> 24:47.216
EVEN IF YOU'RE SCARED THAT
IT'S NOT THE RIGHT THING,

24:47.216 --> 24:49.689
EVEN IF YOU'RE SCARED THAT
IT'LL CAUSE PROBLEMS,

24:49.689 --> 24:51.761
EVEN IF YOU'RE SCARED

24:51.761 --> 24:54.023
THAT IT WILL BURN YOUR LIFE
TO THE GROUND,

24:54.023 --> 24:57.026
YOU SAY IT,
AND YOU SAY IT LOUD.

24:57.026 --> 25:01.230
AND THEN YOU GO FROM THERE.

25:01.230 --> 25:03.232
HEY, WHERE'S MY KID?
I WANT TO SEE SOFIA.

25:03.232 --> 25:05.034
AVERY, WHY DON'T YOU
RUN UP TO DAY CARE

25:05.034 --> 25:06.536
AND BRING HER DOWN HERE?

25:06.536 --> 25:08.608
(chair rattles)
I CAN'T BRING A BABY
IN THE I.C.U.

25:08.608 --> 25:10.179
NO,
BUT YOU CAN SNEAK ONE IN.

25:10.179 --> 25:11.941
COME ON, AVERY.
GROW A PAIR.

25:11.941 --> 25:14.113
YOU KNOW WHAT? FORGET IT.
I'LL DO IT.

25:14.113 --> 25:15.645
WHOA, NO, NO, NO.
ALL RIGHT. I'LL GET HER.
(grunts)

25:15.645 --> 25:17.046
I'LL GET HER.
YES!

25:17.046 --> 25:18.618
MY MAN!

25:20.089 --> 25:21.520
(exhales deeply)

25:21.520 --> 25:24.093
(monitor beeping steadily)

25:24.093 --> 25:26.826
(exhales)

25:28.127 --> 25:30.099
(exhales)

25:30.099 --> 25:31.861
IS THIS WHAT I THINK IT IS?

25:31.861 --> 25:33.833
THERE'S NO WAY TO KNOW.

25:36.105 --> 25:38.107
UM...

25:38.107 --> 25:41.040
WE'LL JUST...
TAKE IT AS IT COMES.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.712
OKAY?

25:42.712 --> 25:45.044
(sighs)

25:45.044 --> 25:47.977
UM, CAN WE TALK?
I'M LEAVING.

25:47.977 --> 25:50.920
NO. ACTUALLY, I'VE GOTTA
GRAB SOFIA FOR SLOAN.

25:50.920 --> 25:52.622
HE NEEDS TO SEE HER.

25:52.622 --> 25:54.323
BUT I CAN, UH,
CALL YOU LATER.

25:54.323 --> 25:56.085
UH, NO, JACKSON.
I'M--I'M LEAVING...

25:56.085 --> 25:57.857
FOR HOME--MOLINE.

25:57.857 --> 25:59.659
MY FLIGHT'S IN A FEW HOURS.

25:59.659 --> 26:00.830
(elevator bell dings)

26:00.830 --> 26:02.191
WHAT DO YOU--

26:02.191 --> 26:04.163
I... I DON'T HAVE
A JOB HERE ANYMORE.

26:04.163 --> 26:06.896
MY CONTRACT ACTUALLY ENDED
A FEW DAYS AGO,

26:06.896 --> 26:09.198
BUT I STUCK AROUND,
WAITING FOR SLOAN TO GET BETTER,

26:09.198 --> 26:11.841
AND HE'S BETTER, SO...

26:11.841 --> 26:14.674
UM, ALL RIGHT, I'VE GOTTA
GET SOFIA RIGHT NOW.

26:14.674 --> 26:16.145
OKAY?
BUT CAN YOU JUST WAIT?

26:16.145 --> 26:17.647
JUST WAIT FOR ME AT JOE'S.

26:17.647 --> 26:19.979
WE CAN HAVE A DRINK.
WE CAN TALK.

26:19.979 --> 26:22.211
JUST... OKAY?
JUST WAIT FOR ME AT JOE'S.

26:22.211 --> 26:23.582
OKAY.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.154
ALL RIGHT.

26:27.056 --> 26:28.217
DON'T TELL CALLIE.

26:28.217 --> 26:30.790
SHE'S ABOUT TO OPERATE
ON DEREK.

26:30.790 --> 26:32.321
OKAY.

26:32.321 --> 26:35.024
(whirring)
DEREK DOESN'T NEED TO GO
IN THIS SURGERY WORRIED,

26:35.024 --> 26:37.266
SO DON'T SAY ANYTHING TO HIM.

26:37.266 --> 26:39.328
THEY CAN RESCHEDULE
THE SURGERY, MARK.

26:39.328 --> 26:41.030
I'M SURE THEY'D WANT TO.
NO.

26:41.030 --> 26:43.202
THAT SURGERY'S
GONNA GET DEREK

26:43.202 --> 26:46.035
BACK INTO THE O.R.
WHERE HE BELONGS.

26:48.377 --> 26:50.910
NOBODY'S GOT BETTER HANDS
THAN HIM,

26:50.910 --> 26:53.643
EXCEPT MAYBE CALLIE.

26:53.643 --> 26:56.916
HAVE YOU LOOKED AT HER HANDS?
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.

26:56.916 --> 27:00.189
SOFIA HAS HER HANDS.

27:00.189 --> 27:01.851
(exhales)

27:01.851 --> 27:03.392
CALLIE...

27:03.392 --> 27:06.996
REALLY DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
HOW GOOD SHE IS.

27:06.996 --> 27:10.129
SOMETIMES
YOU WISH PEOPLE...

27:10.129 --> 27:13.202
WOULD JUST SEE THEMSELVES
THE WAY YOU DO.

27:16.035 --> 27:18.738
LISTEN TO ME.

27:18.738 --> 27:20.770
THIS THE SURGE TALKING?

27:20.770 --> 27:22.712
NO, THIS IS YOU.

27:22.712 --> 27:24.774
THIS IS ALL YOU.

27:24.774 --> 27:27.316
SO KEEP GOING...

27:27.316 --> 27:30.179
'CAUSE I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

27:41.160 --> 27:44.163
(scanner humming)

27:47.967 --> 27:49.969
(both speaking inaudibly)

27:49.969 --> 27:51.670
THE EXTENSIVE BONE INJURY

27:51.670 --> 27:53.142
ALONG WITH THE DEGREE
OF SOFT-TISSUE INFECTION

27:53.142 --> 27:55.004
IS... TROUBLING.

27:55.004 --> 27:56.706
NO MATTER WHAT WE DO, IT'S--

27:56.706 --> 27:57.847
IF THE INFECTION
GOES TO THE BONE,

27:57.847 --> 27:59.308
IT'LL BE HARD TO TREAT.

27:59.308 --> 28:02.812
AND EVENTUALLY,
YOU'RE LOOKING AT BONE LOSS.

28:02.812 --> 28:04.854
I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY...

28:04.854 --> 28:06.986
OFFICIALLY,
I'M RECOMMENDING AMPUTATION.

28:06.986 --> 28:09.889
(curtain rings clatter)
OHH.

28:09.889 --> 28:11.921
SHOW ME THOSE.

28:11.921 --> 28:13.793
(monitor beeping steadily)

28:13.793 --> 28:15.464
SHOW THEM TO ME.

28:15.464 --> 28:18.467
(telephone ringing in distance)

28:20.800 --> 28:23.803
(man speaking indistinctly)
over P.A.)

28:25.474 --> 28:27.136
I WITHHOLD CONSENT.

28:27.136 --> 28:28.838
I WITHHOLD CONSENT.

28:28.838 --> 28:29.979
BEFORE YOU DRUG ME
OR SEDATE ME,

28:29.979 --> 28:33.843
I GIVE N-NOBODY PERMISSION
TO CUT OFF MY LEG.

28:33.843 --> 28:38.287
AND CERTAINLY NOT SOME YAHOO
IN DUMP TRUCK, IDAHO.

28:40.850 --> 28:43.322
I WANT TO GO HOME TO CALLIE.

28:43.322 --> 28:45.494
SHE'LL KNOW WHAT TO DO.

28:47.496 --> 28:50.299
(voice breaks)
JUST TAKE ME HOME.

28:50.299 --> 28:53.232
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

28:53.232 --> 28:55.064
HOW'S THAT?
MM. YEAH.

28:55.064 --> 28:56.806
DOES THAT FEEL ALL RIGHT?
DOES THAT HURT?

28:56.806 --> 28:59.008
IT DOESN'T HURT.

28:59.008 --> 29:01.340
AND ANYTHING THAT
DOESN'T HURT FEELS GOOD.

29:01.340 --> 29:03.873
THANKS.

29:03.873 --> 29:05.815
IS THE INFECTION
BETTER OR WORSE?

29:05.815 --> 29:07.216
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT
RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

29:07.216 --> 29:08.778
JUST...
(snaps gloves)

29:08.778 --> 29:10.980
TRY TO FEEL GOOD.

29:10.980 --> 29:13.022
HEY.

29:15.184 --> 29:16.425
HEY.

29:16.425 --> 29:18.457
UH, SORRY I HAVEN'T
BEEN AROUND.

29:18.457 --> 29:20.860
I, UH, JUST WANTED
TO LET YOU KNOW

29:20.860 --> 29:22.091
THAT I GAVE, UH, CHUNKY STU--

29:22.091 --> 29:25.164
UH, SORRY, STUART,
HIS INTESTINAL TRANSPLANT TODAY.

29:25.164 --> 29:28.137
IT WENT GREAT. HE'S--
HE'S RESPONDING WELL. OH.

29:28.137 --> 29:29.899
UH, AND I KNOW THAT YOU
LIKE TO DO THAT THING

29:29.899 --> 29:31.040
WHERE YOU BRING HIM
HIS FAVORITE FOOD

29:31.040 --> 29:33.002
IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS
WHEN HE CAN HANDLE SOLIDS,

29:33.002 --> 29:35.845
SO IT'S, UH,
IT'S HAWAIIAN PIZZA.

29:37.246 --> 29:40.449
I JUST THOUGHT
I SHOULD TELL YOU.

29:40.449 --> 29:43.112
THANK YOU.

29:46.856 --> 29:49.088
I FEEL LIKE CRAP.

29:50.860 --> 29:52.191
IT SHOULD'VE BEEN ME
ON THAT PLANE.

29:52.191 --> 29:53.993
IF I COULD TRADE PLACES
WITH YOU, I WOULD--

29:53.993 --> 29:55.294
I WOULD LET YOU.

29:55.294 --> 29:56.495
(chuckles)

29:56.495 --> 29:57.867
(chuckles)

29:57.867 --> 29:59.999
I HAD THAT THOUGHT
A LOT, TOO.

29:59.999 --> 30:02.001
AND I DIDN'T LIKE MYSELF
FOR IT,

30:02.001 --> 30:04.403
BUT I DID.

30:04.403 --> 30:06.435
I KEPT THINKING ABOUT
MY WIFE AND BABY

30:06.435 --> 30:09.879
AND HOW YOU HAD NO WIFE
AND NO BABY.

30:09.879 --> 30:12.041
YOU HAD NO ONE.

30:12.041 --> 30:13.812
I ONLY WENT ON THAT PLANE

30:13.812 --> 30:16.015
BECAUSE I WAS PISSED AT YOU.

30:16.015 --> 30:19.048
SO I KEPT WONDERING...

30:19.048 --> 30:24.193
I'M ONLY HERE BECAUSE HE'S
SO SELFISH AND THOUGHTLESS.

30:24.193 --> 30:29.058
AND NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRIED
TO MAKE HIM BETTER,

30:29.058 --> 30:31.000
HE'S STILL A HORRIBLE PERSON.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.032
SO NOW...

30:33.032 --> 30:34.433
(sighs)

30:34.433 --> 30:36.505
I KEEP WONDERING...

30:36.505 --> 30:39.368
WHY THIS WOULD HAPPEN
TO SOMEONE LIKE ME

30:39.368 --> 30:41.971
INSTEAD OF SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

30:43.172 --> 30:46.075
SO I GUESS I'M STILL
PRETTY PISSED OFF.

30:48.978 --> 30:52.421
WOULD YOU GET OUT
OF MY ROOM?

30:52.421 --> 30:54.183
PLEASE.

31:02.331 --> 31:04.633
(indistinct conversations)

31:04.633 --> 31:07.066
HEY. LOOK WHO'S HERE.

31:07.066 --> 31:08.938
HEY. WE JUST HAD LUNCH.

31:08.938 --> 31:11.870
AND NOW IT'S BACK TO
THE CRAYON MINES FOR HER.
HI, BABY.

31:11.870 --> 31:14.003
GOOD-BYE, SWEETIE. BYE.
MWAH.

31:14.003 --> 31:15.905
BYE, BABY.
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT. MWAH.

31:15.905 --> 31:17.076
OH. (laughs)

31:17.076 --> 31:19.478
OKAY.
(singsongy) CRAYONS. CRAYONS.

31:19.478 --> 31:22.181
(whimpers)

31:22.181 --> 31:24.483
(exhales)

31:24.483 --> 31:26.155
YOU NEED TO TAKE HER
TO THE PARK MORE.

31:26.155 --> 31:27.987
SHE GOES FROM THAT APARTMENT
TO THE DAY CARE.

31:27.987 --> 31:29.658
SHE'S INDOORS ALL DAY.

31:29.658 --> 31:31.020
OKAY.

31:31.020 --> 31:33.022
YEAH. WE SHOULD--
WE SHOULD GET A HOUSE.

31:33.022 --> 31:35.194
WHOA. (chuckles)
SLOW DOWN.

31:35.194 --> 31:38.367
THEN SHE COULD HAVE A YARD
AND SHE DOESN'T...

31:38.367 --> 31:40.599
HAVE TO BE INSIDE...

31:40.599 --> 31:41.971
ALL THE TIME.

31:41.971 --> 31:43.902
HEY.
(chair rattles)

31:43.902 --> 31:45.434
HEY, HEY, HEY.

31:45.434 --> 31:47.436
HEY. WHAT'S WRONG?

31:47.436 --> 31:50.079
DO WE HAVE A PLAN YET?

31:50.079 --> 31:51.510
DO WE?

31:51.510 --> 31:53.282
WE ARE WAITING
FOR THE INFECTION TO IMPROVE,

31:53.282 --> 31:55.414
AND THEN WE WILL KNOW
WHAT OPTIONS WE HAVE.

31:55.414 --> 31:56.615
WELL, IF THE VANCOMYCIN
ISN'T WORKING,

31:56.615 --> 31:59.348
THEN PUT ME ON COLISTIN.
IT'LL BE STRONGER.

31:59.348 --> 32:01.050
I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S HARD
TO JUST--
NO, YOU DON'T.

32:01.050 --> 32:04.423
YOU DON'T, BECAUSE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOUR LIFE IS GOING TO BE.

32:04.423 --> 32:08.427
YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO...
(crying) TAKE HER TO THE PARK

32:08.427 --> 32:10.329
OR IF YOU'RE GONNA STAND
AT AN O.R. TABLE AGAIN.

32:10.329 --> 32:12.031
YOU WILL. OF COURSE YOU WILL.

32:12.031 --> 32:14.063
I KNOW.
I KNOW WHAT MY OPTIONS ARE!

32:14.063 --> 32:16.265
AND THE LONGER WE WAIT,

32:16.265 --> 32:18.167
THE MORE THAT
MY VASCULARITY DIMINISHES,

32:18.167 --> 32:20.239
THE MORE THE NERVES DIE,
THE MORE THE MUSCLE ATROPHIES,

32:20.239 --> 32:22.641
AND THEN THERE'S ONLY
ONE OPTION LEFT!

32:22.641 --> 32:24.543
OKAY, WE ARE SO FAR
FROM THAT HAPPENING.

32:24.543 --> 32:25.714
DO SOMETHING, CALLIE!

32:25.714 --> 32:27.446
YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.448
PLEASE. PLEASE DON'T GIVE UP
ON--ON ME.

32:29.448 --> 32:31.080
ARIZONA, I'M NOT.

32:31.080 --> 32:32.421
PROMISE--PROMISE ME...
I-I--

32:32.421 --> 32:35.124
YOU WON'T LET THEM TAKE
MY LEG.

32:36.055 --> 32:37.286
I PROMISE.

32:37.286 --> 32:39.088
(cries)

32:39.088 --> 32:41.430
I DO. I PROMISE, OKAY?
I PROMISE YOU.

32:41.430 --> 32:42.591
(sobbing)

32:42.591 --> 32:43.962
IT'S ALL RIGHT, SWEETHEART.

32:43.962 --> 32:45.394
(whispers) IT'S OKAY.

32:45.394 --> 32:47.466
(continues sobbing)

32:47.466 --> 32:48.697
THIS IS A GOOD PLAN.

32:48.697 --> 32:50.099
YOU'RE NOT HER DOCTOR.

32:50.099 --> 32:51.070
OH, I'M NOT SAYING
I'LL DO THE SURGERY.

32:51.070 --> 32:52.341
CARLSON CAN DO IT.

32:52.341 --> 32:53.972
THERE IS A REAL POSSIBILITY
SHE MAY LOSE HER LEG.

32:53.972 --> 32:55.274
YOU NEED TO HELP HER
PREPARE FOR THAT.

32:55.274 --> 32:56.545
NO, NO! NO.

32:56.545 --> 32:58.077
AN INTRAMEDULLARY NAILING
CAN SAVE THE LEG.

32:58.077 --> 32:59.408
DEFINE "SAVE"?

32:59.408 --> 33:02.081
HER LEG
WILL NEVER BE THE SAME.

33:02.081 --> 33:04.083
A PROSTHETIC CAN GIVE ARIZONA
A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE

33:04.083 --> 33:05.714
THAN YEARS OF REHAB
AND CHRONIC PAIN.

33:05.714 --> 33:07.256
I DON'T NEED
TO TELL YOU THIS.

33:07.256 --> 33:09.058
NO, IN FACT,
IT'S PRETTY CONDESCENDING.

33:09.058 --> 33:11.060
OR THE SURGERY WILL MAKE
HER INFECTION WORSE

33:11.060 --> 33:12.321
AND INCREASE HER RISK
OF D.V.T.

33:12.321 --> 33:14.093
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.
IT'S HER LEG.

33:14.093 --> 33:15.364
I'M RISKING IT.
I AM DOING IT.

33:15.364 --> 33:16.665
YOU ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING.

33:16.665 --> 33:17.666
(scoffs)

33:17.666 --> 33:19.198
SHE IS YOUR WIFE,
NOT YOUR PATIENT.

33:19.198 --> 33:21.200
SHE'S NOT, THOUGH.
SHE'S NOT MY WIFE!

33:21.200 --> 33:22.501
(crying)

33:22.501 --> 33:23.632
I...

33:23.632 --> 33:26.175
(sniffles)

33:26.175 --> 33:29.108
(inhales)
I DON'T KNOW WHO SHE IS.

33:30.579 --> 33:32.611
DID THIS HAPPEN
WITH CRISTINA?

33:32.611 --> 33:36.345
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE LOOKING AT HER,
BUT THERE'S NOTHING INSIDE?

33:36.345 --> 33:38.047
I FEEL LIKE SHE'S JUST
THIS SHELL.

33:38.047 --> 33:39.348
ALL THE ARIZONA'S
BEEN SCOOPED OUT...

33:39.348 --> 33:41.050
(voice breaking)
AND SHE'S JUST THIS SHELL NOW,

33:41.050 --> 33:42.291
AND I WANT HER BACK.

33:42.291 --> 33:45.023
AND I DON'T THINK
I'LL EVER GET HER BACK

33:45.023 --> 33:46.355
IF WE CUT OFF THAT LEG,

33:46.355 --> 33:48.157
SO I'M GOING TO SAVE IT.

33:48.157 --> 33:50.699
I'VE MADE A PLAN TO SAVE IT,
AND YOU'RE GONNA GET ON BOARD.

33:50.699 --> 33:52.701
AND THEN WE'LL WORK OUT A PLAN
TO GET CRISTINA BACK,

33:52.701 --> 33:56.265
BUT YOU NEED TO HELP ME NOW.

33:56.265 --> 33:58.237
(sighs)

33:58.237 --> 34:01.140
I DON'T THINK I'M EVER
GONNA GET CRISTINA BACK.

34:01.140 --> 34:03.242
(huffs)

34:06.475 --> 34:09.178
(sighs)

34:09.178 --> 34:11.580
YOU GONNA USE A FREE FLAP
TO COVER THE OPEN FRACTURE SITE?

34:14.052 --> 34:15.824
YEAH.

34:15.824 --> 34:19.128
WHERE ARE YOU THINKING
ABOUT PULLING IT FROM?

34:19.128 --> 34:20.289
THERE WE GO.

34:20.289 --> 34:21.460
MM.

34:21.460 --> 34:23.262
(beep)
(hums)

34:23.262 --> 34:24.663
(beeps)

34:24.663 --> 34:27.096
MWAH. THAT'S FROM MARK.
HE'S STILL DOING GREAT.

34:27.096 --> 34:28.767
HE SAID TO TELL YOU
GOOD LUCK TOMORROW.

34:28.767 --> 34:31.069
HEY, IT'S STILL WAY DOWN.
OH.

34:31.069 --> 34:32.571
LOOKS GOOD.
AND I HAVEN'T EATEN
SINCE BREAKFAST.

34:32.571 --> 34:34.203
OKAY, YOUR SURGERY'S NOT
TILL NOON TOMORROW.

34:34.203 --> 34:35.544
CARLSON DOESN'T CARE
IF YOU EAT NOW.

34:35.544 --> 34:38.177
WELL, I'M JUST--I'M GONNA BE
AN UNBELIEVABLY GOOD PATIENT.

34:38.177 --> 34:39.148
MM.

34:39.148 --> 34:40.309
(smartphone chimes)

34:40.309 --> 34:42.551
OH. OKAY. (sighs)

34:42.551 --> 34:44.183
I HAVE TO GO.

34:44.183 --> 34:46.285
'CAUSE YOU'RE
AN UNBELIEVABLY GOOD DOCTOR.

34:46.285 --> 34:47.256
SAY MORE.

34:47.256 --> 34:48.617
(chuckles) COME HERE.

34:48.617 --> 34:51.089
MY WIFE IS THE DOCTOR
THAT'S GOING TO FIX

34:51.089 --> 34:52.491
DEREK SHEPHERD'S
MILLION-DOLLAR HAND.

34:52.491 --> 34:54.293
SHE'S THAT GOOD.

34:54.293 --> 34:56.195
OKAY, STOP.
YOU'RE FREAKING ME OUT NOW.

34:56.195 --> 34:58.227
YOU...

34:58.227 --> 35:00.269
ARE OUTSTANDING.

35:00.269 --> 35:02.201
AND I LOVE YOU.

35:03.532 --> 35:05.504
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

35:05.504 --> 35:08.607
MM.

35:08.607 --> 35:12.181
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

35:12.181 --> 35:15.214
I, UH, BROUGHT YOU A PIECE
OF CHUNKY STU'S PIZZA.

35:15.214 --> 35:19.117
HE'S, UH, HE'S EATING TONIGHT,
THANKS TO YOU...

35:19.117 --> 35:21.320
US. (chuckles)

35:21.320 --> 35:22.591
UH...

35:24.253 --> 35:26.495
HE'S OUT OF THE WOODS,
SO...

35:26.495 --> 35:28.297
I'M OUT OF HERE.

35:28.297 --> 35:30.199
UM, I'M GOING TO HOPKINS.

35:30.199 --> 35:31.900
I'VE REALLY, UH, BEEN
BUSTING MY ASS TO MAKE SURE

35:31.900 --> 35:33.432
EVERYTHING'S RUN SMOOTHLY,

35:33.432 --> 35:36.565
AND, UH, NOW I'M--
I'M DONE.

35:38.237 --> 35:40.609
SO JUST...

35:40.609 --> 35:43.742
GOOD-BYE.

35:52.521 --> 35:54.383
I'M SORRY THIS HAPPENED
TO YOU

35:54.383 --> 35:57.155
AND I'M SORRY
THAT IT MADE YOU HATE ME.

35:59.858 --> 36:01.760
(monitor beeping erratically)

36:01.760 --> 36:05.334
(gasping)

36:07.236 --> 36:09.167
IT'S ARIZONA.
THERE'S A PROBLEM.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.599
WHAT?
SHE'S CRASHING.

36:10.599 --> 36:11.770
CRASHING? SHE'S--

36:11.770 --> 36:13.742
TEMP'S 104,
SERUM LACTATE IS 6.

36:13.742 --> 36:15.274
SHE'S IN SEPTIC SHOCK.

36:15.274 --> 36:16.605
SHUT UP. SHUT UP.
SHUT UP.

36:16.605 --> 36:18.307
UH, DO YOU HAVE HER
ON PRESSORS?

36:18.307 --> 36:19.748
I'VE GOT HER ON PRESSORS,
TRIPLE ANTIBIOTICS.

36:19.748 --> 36:21.250
I'VE GOT HER ON AGGRESSIVE
I.V. FLUIDS.

36:21.250 --> 36:23.252
DID YOU GIVE HER
SUPPLEMENTAL OXYGEN?

36:23.252 --> 36:24.553
I INTUBATED HER.
SHE'S CRASHING.

36:24.553 --> 36:26.285
DO YOU...

36:26.285 --> 36:28.317
UH, DID YOU START HER ON
HY-HYDROCORTISONE?

36:28.317 --> 36:29.288
YEAH.

36:29.288 --> 36:31.390
UM... DO YOU
HAVE HER ON PRESSORS?

36:31.390 --> 36:32.491
YES, I TOLD YOU. YES.

36:32.491 --> 36:35.193
LOOK,
SHE'S STILL DETERIORATING.

36:35.193 --> 36:37.726
SHE'S DYING.

36:37.726 --> 36:39.328
IT'S THE LEG.

36:39.328 --> 36:41.330
IT'S THE LEG.

36:41.330 --> 36:43.272
(pants)

36:43.272 --> 36:44.673
(exhales deeply)

36:49.838 --> 36:52.481
CUT IT OFF.

36:57.746 --> 36:59.918
GO. JUST DO A GOOD JOB,
PLEASE. DO YOUR BEST.

37:03.422 --> 37:05.324
(exhales)
