00:05.320 --> 00:08.121
So, I just got off the
phone with the bank,

00:08.122 --> 00:10.824
and apparently, I've gone past overdraft

00:10.826 --> 00:13.439
into something they're
gonna call "backdraft",

00:13.441 --> 00:15.031
which means I'm on fire.

00:16.123 --> 00:18.367
I need money fast, or
I'm gonna lose my car.

00:18.369 --> 00:20.158
Until we sell some ads,

00:20.160 --> 00:21.714
there is no money coming in.

00:21.716 --> 00:23.454
And I'm out there busting my ass,

00:23.456 --> 00:25.489
but it is just really
tough to get people

00:25.491 --> 00:27.725
to commit to a magazine
that doesn't exist yet.

00:27.727 --> 00:29.193
So, what are you saying?

00:29.195 --> 00:31.395
Y-You're saying this
may not actually happen?

00:31.397 --> 00:32.496
I don't know.

00:32.497 --> 00:35.399
I told you, new businesses are
hard to get off the ground.

00:35.401 --> 00:37.468
Well, I mean, I don't
know what I'm gonna do.

00:37.470 --> 00:39.570
I was barely getting
by when I had a job.

00:39.572 --> 00:40.805
I haven't worked in months.

00:40.807 --> 00:42.590
I maxed out all my credit cards,

00:42.592 --> 00:44.141
including the one that
came in Becky's name

00:44.143 --> 00:45.463
that she doesn't even know about.

00:46.546 --> 00:48.546
I'm gonna have to get another job.

00:48.548 --> 00:49.603
What am I gonna do?

00:49.605 --> 00:51.716
Other than writing, I'm
basically unemployable.

00:51.718 --> 00:54.485
Oh, come on. You're gonna be fine.

00:54.487 --> 00:56.854
You have lots of skills.

00:56.856 --> 00:59.223
Don't make me name them.

00:59.225 --> 01:01.492
Hi. Are the machines empty?

01:01.494 --> 01:04.361
Hey, um, it's great to get to see you

01:04.364 --> 01:05.857
when you come over to do laundry.

01:05.859 --> 01:07.882
Is there a way I can enjoy your company

01:07.884 --> 01:10.534
that doesn't cost me
water and electricity?

01:10.536 --> 01:12.236
I'm not going to the laundromat.

01:12.238 --> 01:13.871
Last time, I caught some weirdo

01:13.873 --> 01:15.506
smelling one of my bras.

01:15.508 --> 01:16.899
I don't care if he works there.

01:16.901 --> 01:17.901
It's not cool.

01:19.245 --> 01:21.579
Hey, you know,

01:21.581 --> 01:23.447
Harris works at Price Warehouse.

01:23.449 --> 01:25.616
Maybe she could help
get you a job there.

01:25.618 --> 01:28.519
Oh, God. Has it come to that?

01:28.521 --> 01:30.454
Alright, I guess I could ask her,

01:30.456 --> 01:31.789
but she wouldn't even let me work

01:31.791 --> 01:33.924
in her pretend bakery when she was 7.

01:33.926 --> 01:35.960
She said I depressed the customers.

01:39.399 --> 01:42.566
Hey. Quick question.

01:42.568 --> 01:45.025
Is Price Warehouse hiring?

01:45.027 --> 01:46.250
Yeah.

01:46.252 --> 01:47.605
Do you know someone
who's looking for a job?

01:47.607 --> 01:49.473
I desperately need a carpool buddy.

01:49.475 --> 01:51.876
Yes, it's me, your mommy.

01:51.878 --> 01:54.513
Oh. Oh.

01:55.515 --> 01:57.518
Ah, I just got the newsletter.

01:57.520 --> 01:58.816
All the positions have been filled.

01:58.818 --> 02:00.018
It's crazy timing.

02:01.587 --> 02:04.155
Harris, I wouldn't ask if
I didn't really need this.

02:04.157 --> 02:05.589
I'm gonna lose my car.

02:05.591 --> 02:08.491
Oof. Eye roll.

02:08.494 --> 02:11.295
Okay, fine, I'll refer you,

02:11.297 --> 02:12.748
but I'm not gonna lie to them.

02:12.750 --> 02:15.004
I'll say you're my mother
and I kind of know you.

02:15.006 --> 02:16.006
That's it.

02:53.468 --> 02:54.625
"The Conners" is recorded

02:54.627 --> 02:56.244
in front of a live studio audience.

02:56.246 --> 02:57.519
Oh. Hey, Beck.

03:00.546 --> 03:03.047
Who's the dude with Jackie?

03:03.049 --> 03:05.049
She's dating him.

03:05.051 --> 03:06.617
Okay.

03:06.619 --> 03:08.819
For once, I'm gonna vet the guy

03:08.821 --> 03:10.722
before he leaves her a shattered wreck.

03:13.671 --> 03:15.393
Hey, Jack, what's up?

03:15.395 --> 03:16.794
Not much. Good to see you, Dan.

03:16.796 --> 03:18.562
Your takeout order's on the counter.

03:18.564 --> 03:20.064
Don't mind if I do.

03:20.066 --> 03:21.866
Dan Conner, Jackie's brother-in-law.

03:21.868 --> 03:24.335
Ron Dunchak.

03:24.337 --> 03:25.736
I'm sorry for interrupting,

03:25.738 --> 03:27.339
but I love to meet people.

03:28.975 --> 03:30.808
What is it you do, Ron?

03:30.810 --> 03:32.099
I'm retired.

03:32.101 --> 03:33.524
I had parsley farms.

03:33.526 --> 03:34.745
Made a great living on something

03:34.747 --> 03:37.081
people pick out of their food.

03:37.083 --> 03:38.315
What a coincidence.

03:38.317 --> 03:40.217
I throw away your product
every time I see it.

03:40.219 --> 03:41.852
Wow.

03:43.109 --> 03:45.590
I can't help admiring
that wedding ring, Ron.

03:45.592 --> 03:47.992
- What a beaut.
- Happily married 30 years.

03:47.994 --> 03:50.394
- And here she is.
- Hi.

03:50.396 --> 03:52.696
I'm sorry. Becky told
me this was a date.

03:52.698 --> 03:54.064
It is.

03:54.066 --> 03:57.969
Dan, this is my lovely wife, Janelle.

03:59.605 --> 04:01.439
Hi, Dan.

04:05.077 --> 04:07.612
I'm confused, so I'm gonna go.

04:08.810 --> 04:10.065
Have a nice time

04:10.067 --> 04:12.702
doing whatever each
of you thinks this is.

04:14.754 --> 04:16.053
What the hell is going on?

04:16.055 --> 04:17.620
You told me she was dating that guy.

04:17.623 --> 04:18.956
Oh, she is.

04:18.958 --> 04:20.624
And the girl.

04:20.625 --> 04:23.093
The guy and the girl.

04:23.095 --> 04:25.263
You getting this, old-timer?

04:26.671 --> 04:29.519
So, Jackie, we're
all having a great time.

04:29.521 --> 04:30.724
- Mm-hmm.
- And it just seems like

04:30.726 --> 04:32.816
things would naturally
progress to the next level.

04:32.818 --> 04:34.240
And we were just wondering,

04:34.242 --> 04:36.781
how many times do you
usually go out with someone

04:36.783 --> 04:39.273
before, you know, you...
you sleep with them?

04:39.275 --> 04:42.600
Oh, goodness, um, pbst, I don't know.

04:42.602 --> 04:45.459
Um, 30, 40 times.

04:45.461 --> 04:48.430
Um, what were you guys thinking?

04:50.923 --> 04:52.456
Oh.

04:52.458 --> 04:53.757
So, we're there?

04:53.759 --> 04:55.659
Okay.

04:55.661 --> 04:57.656
How does this work?

04:57.658 --> 05:00.264
Do you go make a sandwich
while we're doing it,

05:00.266 --> 05:02.099
and then when you two are doing it,

05:02.101 --> 05:03.567
do I go make a sandwich?

05:03.569 --> 05:06.070
Or am I the sandwich?

05:08.841 --> 05:10.741
Ohh. Well...

05:10.743 --> 05:13.143
Janelle thought all three
of us should be together.

05:13.145 --> 05:15.479
Yeah, right, 'cause when
I Googled "thrupple",

05:15.481 --> 05:18.349
that seemed to be pretty standard.

05:18.351 --> 05:20.391
Yeah, I mean, I think
it would make everybody

05:20.393 --> 05:21.475
the most comfortable.

05:21.477 --> 05:23.254
I've never been with
a woman, Jackie. Have you?

05:23.256 --> 05:26.857
Just myself, but that has not gone well.

05:26.859 --> 05:29.326
_

05:29.328 --> 05:32.029
Oh, hey, Harris. What do you think?

05:32.031 --> 05:33.520
Mother-daughter beauty pageant.

05:33.522 --> 05:34.832
We wear these? Huh?

05:35.902 --> 05:37.701
You got the job. Congratulations.

05:37.703 --> 05:39.703
So, who's going to be training

05:39.705 --> 05:42.273
our newest and oldest team member?

05:42.275 --> 05:45.376
Well, I was trying to decide
who was gonna train your mom.

05:45.378 --> 05:47.778
Then, I thought, "Hey,
what's more comfortable

05:47.780 --> 05:50.881
than being trained by your own child?"

05:50.883 --> 05:52.816
Yeah. Um, do you have any kids?

05:52.818 --> 05:54.218
No, I don't.

05:54.220 --> 05:56.888
Oh, okay, then this makes more sense.

05:58.090 --> 06:00.524
I can't believe they're
making me do this.

06:00.526 --> 06:02.626
Oh, you think this is bad for you?

06:02.628 --> 06:04.074
Try taking orders from the person

06:04.076 --> 06:05.113
who took off her diaper

06:05.115 --> 06:06.816
and made me chase her
through the airport.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.566
Oh! What was that?

06:09.568 --> 06:10.901
That's Schneider.

06:10.903 --> 06:12.418
He's one of our automated associates

06:12.420 --> 06:13.470
who sweeps the floor.

06:13.472 --> 06:15.139
Oh.

06:15.141 --> 06:17.241
I think he just hit me on purpose.

06:17.243 --> 06:18.742
It's a robot, Mom.

06:18.744 --> 06:19.767
You're just so small,

06:19.769 --> 06:22.169
he probably thought you were
something that fell off a shelf.

06:23.316 --> 06:25.749
Okay, let's get to work.

06:25.751 --> 06:27.741
I am now going to show you

06:27.743 --> 06:29.744
how we do the Price Warehouse fold.

06:31.023 --> 06:32.756
Go. Arm.

06:32.758 --> 06:35.526
- Arm.
- Mm-hmm.

06:35.528 --> 06:37.428
- Shoulder.
- Mm-hmm.

06:37.430 --> 06:39.763
Shoulder. Chop, flip.

06:39.765 --> 06:40.831
Your turn.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.040
Uh, no.

06:50.042 --> 06:52.509
No.

06:52.511 --> 06:54.545
No.

06:54.547 --> 06:55.846
Unh-unh.

06:55.848 --> 06:57.114
No.

06:57.116 --> 06:59.706
Good God, woman, does it
have to be exactly that way?

06:59.708 --> 07:00.764
Yes.

07:00.766 --> 07:02.119
Sheila is going to be judging me

07:02.121 --> 07:03.454
on how well I train you.

07:03.456 --> 07:05.255
So make sure everything in this section

07:05.257 --> 07:07.291
is folded properly
while I finish inventory.

07:07.293 --> 07:09.360
Just follow the one I did.

07:13.809 --> 07:16.466
Okay.

07:16.468 --> 07:19.692
Arm... arm...

07:19.694 --> 07:22.351
shoulder... shoulder...

07:22.353 --> 07:23.941
chop... flip.

07:23.943 --> 07:26.144
Oh, yeah! Who's your mommy?

07:30.449 --> 07:31.771
Um, oh, I'm sorry.

07:31.773 --> 07:34.475
I think maybe your
size is on the bottom.

07:35.602 --> 07:37.258
Uh, it's... it's on the bottom.

07:37.260 --> 07:40.017
The bottom.

07:40.019 --> 07:41.386
The very bottom.

07:42.404 --> 07:43.871
It's on the damn bottom.

07:45.591 --> 07:47.292
No! Go home.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.401
Uh, I am so sorry, ma'am.

07:50.403 --> 07:52.336
I'm a sales associate.
How may I help you?

07:52.338 --> 07:53.794
I'm looking for an XL.

07:53.796 --> 07:55.318
Of course.

07:55.320 --> 07:58.645
That is just right here on the bottom.

08:00.905 --> 08:02.425
Somebody should have told you.

08:04.529 --> 08:06.530
You can't tell the customers to go home.

08:07.765 --> 08:09.688
Not even the stupid ones?

08:09.690 --> 08:11.713
You asked for this job,

08:11.715 --> 08:13.371
and what you do reflects on me.

08:13.373 --> 08:15.708
So get it together and fold these.

08:17.104 --> 08:19.627
The first three letters
of "associate" are "ass".

08:19.629 --> 08:21.052
What did you say?

08:21.054 --> 08:22.743
What? Oh, nothing.

08:29.998 --> 08:32.331
How was your first day?

08:32.332 --> 08:34.782
Uh, I folded sweatshirts

08:34.784 --> 08:37.518
and a robot pushed himself against me.

08:37.520 --> 08:39.052
Did you report it?

08:39.054 --> 08:40.354
'Cause you'll never win.

08:40.356 --> 08:42.657
Robots cover up for other robots.

08:43.866 --> 08:46.967
The real problem is
they made Harris my boss.

08:48.905 --> 08:51.539
Oh, my God, that's hilarious!

08:51.541 --> 08:54.875
They just made me a Price
Warehouse customer for life.

08:55.978 --> 08:57.779
Hey.

09:00.738 --> 09:03.068
What the hell happened to your face?

09:03.070 --> 09:05.293
What do you mean, what happened?

09:05.295 --> 09:06.451
I shaved.

09:06.453 --> 09:08.387
Without asking me?

09:09.531 --> 09:12.232
I need your permission to
do something with my face?

09:12.234 --> 09:15.001
Uh, well, yeah. I'm the one
that's got to look at it all day.

09:16.404 --> 09:17.837
Well, what's wrong with my face?

09:17.839 --> 09:20.874
There's just too much of it.

09:20.876 --> 09:23.843
So, you're saying I'm fat?

09:23.845 --> 09:25.912
Oh, no, no, no, of course not.

09:25.914 --> 09:28.581
It's just, your face...
you got a fat face.

09:30.852 --> 09:33.386
Oh, uh, hey, bring little Bev up.

09:33.388 --> 09:34.754
I'll take care of her for you.

09:34.756 --> 09:37.021
Nah, she's gonna look
at all this pale flesh

09:37.023 --> 09:39.391
and be confused because
there's no nipple on it.

09:43.632 --> 09:46.699
Look, I thought I'd have a
better shot at selling ads

09:46.701 --> 09:48.434
as a clean-cut businessman,

09:48.436 --> 09:50.803
and I was right.

09:50.805 --> 09:54.207
These newly revealed dimples
just got the guy at Garage Depot

09:54.209 --> 09:57.143
interested in running a two-page spread.

09:57.145 --> 10:00.046
Oh, my God, that is fantastic!

10:00.048 --> 10:01.781
Now I can tell Harris I'm quitting

10:01.783 --> 10:03.806
and then make her fold
all my sweatshirts.

10:03.808 --> 10:05.839
Whoa! Hang on.

10:05.841 --> 10:07.230
Now, he won't do anything

10:07.232 --> 10:10.052
until he sees a sample
of the new magazine first,

10:10.054 --> 10:12.254
so I need articles,
the layout, everything.

10:12.256 --> 10:13.846
Alright, well, how long do I have?

10:13.848 --> 10:15.128
Well, as soon as possible.

10:15.130 --> 10:16.796
I don't want to lose this guy.

10:16.798 --> 10:18.838
And these dimples
only mesmerize for so long.

10:21.028 --> 10:22.984
Hey, uh, what do you think?

10:22.986 --> 10:25.577
Does this look right
for a fancy restaurant?

10:25.579 --> 10:28.012
Should I change? I should change.

10:28.014 --> 10:30.014
You look fine. Why are you so nervous?

10:30.016 --> 10:33.017
Tonight's the night
with Ron and Janelle.

10:33.019 --> 10:35.754
Uh, I, uh...

10:35.756 --> 10:37.890
I shaved my entire body.

10:40.875 --> 10:42.164
I don't know who's going where,

10:42.166 --> 10:44.029
so I cleared the decks.

10:45.465 --> 10:47.432
Ready for this?

10:47.434 --> 10:49.467
Yeah, I really care about them,

10:49.469 --> 10:52.504
and sex is a natural
expression of closeness

10:52.506 --> 10:55.039
between... three people.

10:55.041 --> 10:58.943
Sorry, I-I couldn't help but overhear.

10:58.945 --> 11:00.879
Can I offer a man's point of
view that might be helpful?

11:00.881 --> 11:01.980
Sure.

11:01.982 --> 11:04.183
Are you out of your damn mind?!

11:05.485 --> 11:06.718
You're a third wheel.

11:06.720 --> 11:08.620
At some point, they're
gonna get tired of you

11:08.622 --> 11:10.188
and you're gonna get your heart broken.

11:10.190 --> 11:12.044
You just don't understand
our relationship.

11:12.046 --> 11:15.560
You're way too square
to get any of this.

11:15.562 --> 11:18.897
I'm sorry, but nature
works a certain way.

11:18.899 --> 11:20.532
Tea for? Two.

11:20.534 --> 11:22.333
Bicycle built for? Two.

11:22.335 --> 11:24.969
Noah's ark... two lions, two giraffes.

11:24.971 --> 11:26.971
It's not "Lady and the Tramp"

11:26.973 --> 11:30.041
with another Tramp sucking on
the middle of the spaghetti.

11:30.043 --> 11:33.211
Ew!

11:33.213 --> 11:35.914
Ew!

11:35.916 --> 11:38.516
That's... not helpful, Dan.

11:38.518 --> 11:40.518
I will make up my mind in the moment,

11:40.520 --> 11:41.586
and that's that.

11:41.588 --> 11:43.644
I think it's exciting.

11:43.646 --> 11:45.535
But if you change your mind, remember,

11:45.537 --> 11:46.959
"no" means "no"...

11:46.961 --> 11:48.328
and "no".

11:52.098 --> 11:54.783
Oh, and I moved the
"Mug Shot of the Week" column

11:54.785 --> 11:56.374
to the front page so that it pops.

11:56.376 --> 11:57.735
Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

11:57.737 --> 12:00.738
Hey, how are you able to do this at work?

12:00.740 --> 12:01.940
What are you doing?

12:01.942 --> 12:03.107
Are you...

12:03.109 --> 12:05.109
Are you hiding in a dressing room?

12:06.213 --> 12:07.946
Darlene, are you in there?

12:07.948 --> 12:10.382
Ooh, busted. Later.

12:14.965 --> 12:17.565
Hey, team, what are you guys doing
here? Shouldn't you be working?

12:19.226 --> 12:21.125
You're responsible
for your crew, Harris.

12:21.127 --> 12:22.560
When they fail, you fail.

12:22.562 --> 12:24.028
And when you fail, I fail.

12:24.030 --> 12:25.396
And I am this close

12:25.398 --> 12:27.755
to going to the managers'
conference in Branson.

12:27.757 --> 12:30.059
Two words... The... Judds.

12:32.973 --> 12:35.073
Do you have any idea how
bad this makes me look?

12:35.075 --> 12:36.808
You just got me in huge trouble.

12:36.810 --> 12:38.576
Well, I'm sorry. I had to finish this.

12:38.578 --> 12:39.878
It's really important.

12:39.880 --> 12:40.880
So is your job.

12:41.737 --> 12:44.261
Hey, can't you just cover for me?

12:44.263 --> 12:46.886
You know how many times
I got you out of P.E.?

12:46.888 --> 12:49.078
If anybody had their period
that many times in a year,

12:49.080 --> 12:51.123
they'd need a transfusion.

12:52.323 --> 12:53.813
This isn't P.E., Mom.

12:53.815 --> 12:55.070
This is the real world.

12:55.072 --> 12:56.160
Uh, no, it isn't.

12:56.162 --> 12:57.736
This is the third ring of Hell,

12:57.738 --> 12:59.304
where you fold the same sweatshirt

12:59.306 --> 13:01.406
over and over for an eternity.

13:01.408 --> 13:03.575
You know, you're right.

13:03.577 --> 13:05.210
You're way too good for this place.

13:05.212 --> 13:07.179
So I'm gonna save you the
bother of coming in anymore.

13:07.181 --> 13:08.346
You're fired.

13:08.348 --> 13:09.838
What?

13:09.840 --> 13:11.663
You can't fire your mother.

13:11.665 --> 13:13.018
You're not my mother.

13:13.020 --> 13:14.553
You're Darlene from Women's Apparel,

13:14.555 --> 13:16.755
and she sucks.

13:16.757 --> 13:18.557
Don't forget to leave
your vest on the way out.

13:18.559 --> 13:20.846
Oh! Oh, no, not the vest!

13:20.848 --> 13:22.881
Don't make me leave the vest!

13:22.883 --> 13:24.549
What will I wear to meet the queen?!

13:28.925 --> 13:30.996
That dinner was amazing.

13:30.998 --> 13:32.297
Right?

13:32.299 --> 13:34.333
Lobster was a little
garlicky, don't you think?

13:34.335 --> 13:36.735
It was, wasn't it? Mints, everyone?

13:36.737 --> 13:37.936
- Oh. Yes.
- Oh. Yeah.

13:37.938 --> 13:39.605
Mm. Ron.

13:39.607 --> 13:40.773
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

13:40.775 --> 13:41.840
Mmm.

13:41.842 --> 13:43.075
Mm-hmm.

13:45.179 --> 13:46.245
Mm.

13:46.247 --> 13:47.346
How about some champagne?

13:47.348 --> 13:49.281
Oh, yes, I'll take a bottle.

13:49.283 --> 13:52.117
I'll get it.

13:52.119 --> 13:53.886
Thanks, honey.

13:55.055 --> 13:57.756
Oh, well, wow.

13:57.758 --> 14:00.257
"The History of Parsley".

14:00.259 --> 14:04.396
Well you don't see that every day.

14:07.601 --> 14:10.969
Oh, uh, I guess you
got started without me.

14:10.971 --> 14:13.238
Well, we, uh, started
talking about parsley,

14:13.240 --> 14:16.642
and as you can imagine,
one thing led to another.

14:16.644 --> 14:18.410
Ron, I thought we agreed,

14:18.412 --> 14:19.978
we were all gonna do this together.

14:19.980 --> 14:22.599
I was just trying to break the
ice, make Jackie more comfortable.

14:22.601 --> 14:24.000
Oh, no, don't worry about me.

14:24.002 --> 14:26.904
I've got a bottle of
comfortable right here.

14:27.901 --> 14:30.422
I'm just saying that I
could have been in the room

14:30.424 --> 14:32.391
when we were making
Jackie more comfortable.

14:32.393 --> 14:34.159
We're all here to have
a good time, Janelle.

14:34.161 --> 14:36.995
- That's great. When does my good time start?
- Janelle.

14:36.997 --> 14:38.498
- Ron.
- Hey, Ron,

14:38.500 --> 14:40.550
uh, if you kiss Janelle,

14:40.552 --> 14:42.460
we can all be even and start fresh.

14:42.462 --> 14:44.514
Maybe Ron's tired of kissing me.

14:44.516 --> 14:46.071
At least, that's what
he told the therapist.

14:46.073 --> 14:47.139
I didn't say "tired of".

14:47.141 --> 14:49.074
I said it felt like work.

14:49.076 --> 14:51.731
Time to clock in, Ron.

14:51.733 --> 14:53.927
Start kissing Janelle.

14:53.929 --> 14:56.052
I don't think Janelle
wants to be kissed.

14:56.054 --> 14:57.783
I think Janelle wants to be mad.

14:57.785 --> 15:00.378
Uh, you know, I was, uh,

15:00.380 --> 15:02.187
formerly Lanford's leading life coach,

15:02.189 --> 15:04.523
and I have found, what
really helps in situations...

15:04.525 --> 15:06.425
You know, this isn't
gonna make you a man.

15:06.427 --> 15:07.926
You failed at parsley,

15:07.928 --> 15:10.128
and you failed as a husband.

15:10.130 --> 15:13.298
Everything you touch dies!

15:13.300 --> 15:15.465
Well, I've been touching
myself for 20 years,

15:15.467 --> 15:16.501
and I'm not dead.

15:19.807 --> 15:21.807
I love Jackie.

15:21.809 --> 15:24.276
You love what, now?

15:24.278 --> 15:26.768
Come on, Jackie, you
feel it, too, don't you?

15:26.770 --> 15:29.505
Uh, I think this would be a good time

15:29.507 --> 15:32.618
for me to get my swan and skedaddle.

15:32.620 --> 15:33.853
Take me with you, Jackie.

15:33.855 --> 15:35.196
No, not happening, Ron.

15:35.198 --> 15:37.778
I wanted a nice old-fashioned threesome,

15:37.780 --> 15:40.448
and you had to go make it weird!

15:43.616 --> 15:45.739
Oh, I have to vent to somebody.

15:45.741 --> 15:47.366
Your sister is out of her mind.

15:47.368 --> 15:49.134
I only put up with it

15:49.136 --> 15:52.172
because she's a joy to be around.

15:52.174 --> 15:55.666
She completely disrespected
me, so I had to fire her.

15:55.668 --> 15:58.301
She comes in and she starts
immediately screwing off,

15:58.303 --> 15:59.569
and she gets me in trouble.

15:59.571 --> 16:02.420
She doesn't care
that she's ruining my life.

16:02.422 --> 16:05.057
Well, she's horrible.

16:06.378 --> 16:09.146
We thought you knew.

16:09.148 --> 16:11.515
You really think I'm ruining your life?

16:11.517 --> 16:14.151
We got to talk. Give us a minute.

16:14.153 --> 16:15.353
Of course.

16:24.363 --> 16:26.963
Don't try to blame this on me.

16:26.965 --> 16:28.832
You could have given
me a couple more hours

16:28.834 --> 16:30.033
to finish the mockup.

16:30.035 --> 16:31.702
You just don't get that I'm an adult now

16:31.704 --> 16:33.537
and this is actually my career.

16:33.539 --> 16:35.195
Okay.

16:35.197 --> 16:37.153
You want me to treat you like an adult?

16:37.155 --> 16:39.383
Here's a truth I would never tell a kid.

16:40.913 --> 16:42.345
I'm desperate.

16:42.347 --> 16:44.848
Please. We're all desperate.

16:44.850 --> 16:47.317
No, you don't get it.

16:47.319 --> 16:50.087
If Mark and I weren't here,
living with your grandpa,

16:50.089 --> 16:51.555
we would be on the street.

16:51.557 --> 16:52.823
What do you mean?

16:52.825 --> 16:55.392
You're starting that
magazine up with Ben, right?

16:55.394 --> 16:56.459
You're gonna be okay.

16:56.461 --> 16:58.662
But that may never happen.

16:58.664 --> 17:02.866
And this is my only shot at
having some kind of future.

17:02.868 --> 17:04.034
Wow.

17:04.036 --> 17:06.603
I-I guess I didn't
realize how bad it was.

17:06.605 --> 17:08.338
I'm sorry, Mom.

17:08.339 --> 17:10.707
Well, I appreciate that,

17:10.709 --> 17:13.743
but you already fired
me, so it's too late.

17:13.746 --> 17:17.714
Oh, I'm not sorry I fired you.

17:17.715 --> 17:20.450
I'm sorry I called you a bitch.

17:20.452 --> 17:22.853
No, you... you didn't call me a bitch.

17:22.855 --> 17:25.021
I did, after you left.

17:28.894 --> 17:31.595
Hey, how'd your date go last night?

17:31.597 --> 17:34.900
Did you make God cry
with your triangle of sin?

17:34.902 --> 17:38.092
No, Dan, I did not.

17:38.094 --> 17:39.102
And you were wrong.

17:39.104 --> 17:40.403
They did not break up with me.

17:40.405 --> 17:43.607
They broke up with each other over me.

17:43.609 --> 17:45.876
I'm so sorry, Jackie.

17:45.878 --> 17:47.310
Not as sorry as I am.

17:47.312 --> 17:51.615
I shaved places that were
not meant to have stubble.

17:51.617 --> 17:52.949
Ugh.

17:52.951 --> 17:56.319
Could light a match off my inner thigh.

17:56.321 --> 17:58.221
Guess what.

17:58.223 --> 17:59.389
We're in business.

17:59.391 --> 18:01.458
Just got a call from
the Garage Depot guy.

18:01.460 --> 18:03.960
He loved the mockup and
committed for months!

18:03.962 --> 18:05.095
Yes!

18:05.097 --> 18:06.396
This is amazing!

18:07.833 --> 18:09.633
Ye gods! What did you do?!

18:10.803 --> 18:14.471
What happened to my
beautiful hairy woodsman?

18:14.473 --> 18:17.741
You know, I do have feelings in here.

18:17.743 --> 18:19.109
Aww.

18:19.111 --> 18:21.111
Oh, it feels like warm bologna

18:21.113 --> 18:22.512
that's been sitting in the sun.

18:22.514 --> 18:24.347
Feel it.

18:24.349 --> 18:25.682
Okay, just come on,

18:25.684 --> 18:27.150
get it out of your system

18:27.152 --> 18:28.919
so we can all get on with our lives.

18:28.921 --> 18:31.288
Gross. It's like the bottom of a foot.

18:31.290 --> 18:33.582
No, no, it's softer.

18:33.584 --> 18:35.759
It's like the flappy part
of an old woman's arm

18:35.761 --> 18:37.183
when she's waving goodbye.

18:37.185 --> 18:38.328
Okay, enough!

18:38.330 --> 18:40.430
Dan, help me out here.

18:40.432 --> 18:44.601
Every man has the right
to shave his own face.

18:44.603 --> 18:47.332
I, for one, think it looks good.

18:47.334 --> 18:49.825
I got tired of looking
at that alpaca's ass.

18:52.044 --> 18:53.877
Hi.

18:53.879 --> 18:55.512
Hey, what are you doing here?

18:55.514 --> 18:56.813
Aren't you supposed to be at work?

18:56.815 --> 18:59.216
I got fired.

18:59.218 --> 19:00.450
- Aw, no.
- Oh.

19:00.452 --> 19:02.519
No, wait, was it because of me?

19:02.521 --> 19:04.922
No, stupid robot replaced us all.

19:06.391 --> 19:08.191
Turns out he wasn't
just sweeping the floors.

19:08.193 --> 19:11.328
He was also secretly doing inventory.

19:11.330 --> 19:13.697
Are they still gonna
help you go to college?

19:13.699 --> 19:15.365
- No.
- Oh.

19:15.367 --> 19:17.868
Aw, man. Sorry, honey.

19:17.870 --> 19:20.070
Can I stay here tonight?

19:20.072 --> 19:21.471
Yeah, of course.

19:21.473 --> 19:23.840
Hey, you know it's gonna be okay, right?

19:23.842 --> 19:25.642
Hey, cheer up.

19:25.644 --> 19:28.678
Look at Ben's face.

19:28.680 --> 19:30.014
It's funny, right?

19:31.610 --> 19:34.546
Looks like somebody stuck eyes on a ham.

19:41.226 --> 19:43.275
Hey, that couple over there
wants to talk to you.

19:43.277 --> 19:45.177
I'm just helping out, so I
don't want to get involved.

19:45.179 --> 19:47.846
Oh, man, I hope they didn't
order the lamb goulash.

19:47.848 --> 19:49.248
I told Dwight to throw that out.

19:49.250 --> 19:51.116
No, they haven't ordered anything yet.

19:51.118 --> 19:53.185
I don't think they're
looking for the food.

19:53.187 --> 19:55.621
They've both been checking Jackie out.

19:55.623 --> 19:57.823
I think they're looking for a thrupple.

19:57.825 --> 19:59.158
Oh, darn.

19:59.160 --> 20:02.027
When you're in a small town,
I guess everybody talks.

20:02.029 --> 20:04.572
Well, I know I told
everybody who came in.

20:04.574 --> 20:06.163
Come over there with me.

20:06.165 --> 20:07.666
The guy's wearing a giant cross.

20:07.668 --> 20:09.636
Might be a weirdo.

20:13.063 --> 20:15.286
Uh, may I help you?

20:15.288 --> 20:17.678
Oh, I certainly hope so.

20:17.680 --> 20:19.378
But, honestly,

20:19.380 --> 20:22.047
we're only looking for one other person.

20:22.049 --> 20:24.483
But we'd take two.

20:24.485 --> 20:26.385
Well, I'm sorry.

20:26.387 --> 20:28.157
I know what you may have heard,

20:28.159 --> 20:31.784
but I'm really not a part
of that lifestyle anymore.

20:31.786 --> 20:34.187
What about the boy?

20:35.329 --> 20:37.129
Well, that's very flattering,

20:37.131 --> 20:38.865
but the boy's not interested, either.
