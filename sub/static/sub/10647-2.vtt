WEBVTT

00:02.681 --> 00:04.953
You guys
took down all of S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:05.839 --> 00:08.286
And you're still after
little old Spider-Man?

00:08.394 --> 00:10.355
Wow, Ock's making me blush.

00:10.380 --> 00:13.197
Whoa. Ugh.

00:13.222 --> 00:15.956
Get this. My day
started out fantastic.

00:15.981 --> 00:19.953
<i>Wheatcakes, best friends,
and Dr. Octopus finally captured.</i>

00:19.978 --> 00:21.766
I should've known it couldn't last.

00:21.791 --> 00:24.726
<i>Turns out, Ock tricked me
with his new besties,</i>

00:24.751 --> 00:29.703
<i>the evil organization HYDRA, led
by TV-face himself, Arnim Zola,</i>

00:29.728 --> 00:32.070
<i>who destroyed the Triskelion
and turned the Tri-Carrier</i>

00:32.095 --> 00:34.224
<i>into his own personal HYDRA Island.</i>

00:34.249 --> 00:37.382
<i>My friends are captured, Nick
Fury's injured and missing.</i>

00:37.407 --> 00:38.708
And the cherry on top?

00:38.905 --> 00:41.840
I was saved from almost
drowning by this guy.

00:41.875 --> 00:45.150
I knew I'd regret helping you.
What are these things?

00:45.175 --> 00:46.655
Amped-up HYDRA goons.

00:46.680 --> 00:49.649
Doc Ock mutated them with DNA
from my old enemy, the Goblin.

00:52.625 --> 00:53.793
Doc Ock did this?

00:53.920 --> 00:56.208
What am I saying?
Of course Doc Ock did this.

00:56.233 --> 00:57.194
You know him?

00:57.219 --> 01:00.654
Not to look a gift life-saver
in the mouth, but who are you?

01:00.727 --> 01:02.557
I call myself
Scarlet Spider.

01:02.562 --> 01:03.696
But that doesn't matter.

01:03.721 --> 01:06.063
You'll never see me again.
I'm not part of your world.

01:06.392 --> 01:08.801
No, wait! You said
you were the first Spider.

01:08.835 --> 01:10.204
What's the matter, kid?

01:10.229 --> 01:13.248
You think you're the only person
ever bitten by a radioactive spider?

01:13.273 --> 01:15.940
Yes. Hey! We're not done here.

01:17.352 --> 01:19.508
Yes, we are!

01:20.258 --> 01:21.287
Stingers?

01:21.312 --> 01:22.892
I don't have stingers.

Sync and corrections by <font color="#808040">masaca</font>
- addic7ed.com -

01:34.298 --> 01:38.291
- Hey! Maybe we got off on the wrong foot.
- I shouldn't have saved you, punk.

01:38.402 --> 01:40.914
I broke my only rule.
Never get involved.

01:41.162 --> 01:43.130
Look around, Scarlet.
You already are.

01:43.155 --> 01:45.301
Doc Ock and his goons
have taken over the city.

01:46.315 --> 01:49.615
- It's always that madman, isn't it?
- Tell me about it.

01:50.088 --> 01:53.650
Sounds like we have something in common.
A maniacal, eight-armed enemy.

01:53.713 --> 01:56.068
Otto Octavius kidnapped me.

01:56.355 --> 01:59.587
Experimented on me, painfully.

01:59.980 --> 02:01.386
Sounds like the Ock I know.

02:01.421 --> 02:03.350
<i>I escaped him years ago.</i>

02:03.490 --> 02:08.127
<i>I live underground, in the sewers.</i>
It's the only place for a freak like me.

02:08.495 --> 02:10.488
- A monster.
- A monster?

02:10.964 --> 02:14.190
Uh, we have the same powers.
I'll try not to be insulted.

02:14.215 --> 02:15.934
It's not about the powers.

02:15.959 --> 02:17.597
It's about what I've done.

02:17.996 --> 02:19.621
And what I can't undo.

02:19.646 --> 02:21.787
Let me guess. You hurt
someone you cared about?

02:21.812 --> 02:24.939
Don't try and get me
to open up. Won't work.

02:25.008 --> 02:28.217
I made a bad decision once, and my
Uncle Ben paid the price for it.

02:28.609 --> 02:29.862
So I understand.

02:30.105 --> 02:32.714
But the past doesn't make you
a monster unless you let it.

02:32.826 --> 02:34.076
You can be a hero.

02:34.521 --> 02:36.259
Ock took everything from me, too.

02:36.591 --> 02:38.738
And I can't bring him down
without your help.

02:38.834 --> 02:40.737
I don't help.

02:41.261 --> 02:43.114
Then do it to stop Ock.

02:44.099 --> 02:47.034
Now you're making sense. What
are you waiting for, punk?

02:47.059 --> 02:49.753
- You mean you're in? 
- I'm not joining your little team.

02:49.997 --> 02:52.191
The moment Ock's down, I'm gone.

02:52.216 --> 02:54.917
I knew you'd help out. Spiders
always stick together.

02:55.028 --> 02:57.502
Get it? 'Cause webs are sticky?

02:58.087 --> 02:59.870
- No?
- Yeah, I got it.

03:00.075 --> 03:02.125
- Wasn't funny.
- Ouch.

03:11.391 --> 03:16.305
Attention, former prisoners
of S.H.I.E.L.D. This is not a trick.

03:17.102 --> 03:18.624
It's a challenge.

03:18.649 --> 03:21.858
I am re-forming the Sinister Six.

03:22.157 --> 03:26.530
Backed by the resources of HYDRA, there
will be nothing that can stop us.

03:27.818 --> 03:29.535
The audition is simple.

03:29.786 --> 03:31.580
Find Spider-Man.

03:31.653 --> 03:36.271
The first one to bring him to me
will have a place on the Six.

03:42.408 --> 03:44.972
You live here? No wonder 
you smell so good.

03:44.997 --> 03:46.397
Underground is better.

03:46.459 --> 03:48.647
I can get anywhere in the city unseen.

03:48.672 --> 03:50.881
Looks like the Goblins
are coming from Times Square.

03:50.928 --> 03:52.373
You think they're catching a musical?

03:53.255 --> 03:53.950
Levity?

03:54.178 --> 03:56.026
Deflates the insane amount of tension?

03:56.561 --> 03:58.125
Someone hates fun.

04:01.921 --> 04:03.967
<i>New York City.</i>

04:03.992 --> 04:06.399
<i>The Big Apple.</i>

04:06.424 --> 04:09.214
<i>I, Arnim Zola, assure you</i>

04:09.239 --> 04:13.801
<i>that under HYDRA's rule, you
will be secure from the harm</i>

04:13.840 --> 04:16.952
<i>that unchecked freedom can inflict.</i>

04:16.976 --> 04:18.732
Guys? Oh, no.

04:18.757 --> 04:20.990
<i>As a demonstration
of our power,</i>

04:21.015 --> 04:24.851
<i>we will make an example of the
former S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy.</i>

04:24.876 --> 04:29.146
<i>These so-called heroes,
tools of Nick Fury,</i>

04:29.171 --> 04:33.056
<i>will now bow and hail HYDRA.</i>

04:37.708 --> 04:40.745
- What are you doing to them?
- It's some kind of mind-ray.

04:42.982 --> 04:45.188
- We've got to help.
- You want to get captured too?

04:45.418 --> 04:47.818
This place is swarming with Goblins.

04:49.057 --> 04:50.916
Then we need to get to Oscorp.

04:51.840 --> 04:54.965
Oscorp is where Doc Ock created
the original Goblin serum.

04:55.361 --> 04:58.189
If there's anything that can help
us stop this army, it'll be there.

05:01.095 --> 05:02.054
Ah!

05:02.353 --> 05:04.218
How'd the Goblins track us down here?

05:04.243 --> 05:07.383
Track? Something tells me
this isn't the Goblins.

05:08.691 --> 05:11.766
Like shooting spiders in a barrel.

05:13.379 --> 05:15.996
Kraven the Hunter.
He lives up to the name.

05:16.106 --> 05:18.251
Couldn't his parents have
called him Kraven the Hugger?

05:19.550 --> 05:20.431
Move.

05:24.695 --> 05:26.291
New York's in the middle of an invasion

05:26.326 --> 05:28.609
and you're all, like, "What
a great time for a nice hunt?"

05:28.634 --> 05:31.910
I didn't expect to capture
two Spider-Men.

05:31.935 --> 05:34.701
We're not the same.
He doesn't have these.

05:46.085 --> 05:46.819
Ah!

05:46.851 --> 05:49.163
- You can do bolo-webs?
- You can't?

05:56.663 --> 05:58.468
Now you can call him Kraven the Napper.

05:59.649 --> 06:02.267
Starting to realize why
everyone's always attacking you.

06:02.295 --> 06:03.505
You get used to it.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.408
Hurry. We've got to get to Oscorp.

06:13.406 --> 06:16.952
Thanks for taking the time
to see me, Norman and Harry.

06:17.117 --> 06:21.109
I know the Osborn family
is always very busy.

06:21.147 --> 06:22.998
What do you want from me, Octavius?

06:23.023 --> 06:25.773
Your research? We can make a deal.

06:26.640 --> 06:29.254
I want nothing from you, Norman.

06:29.422 --> 06:31.029
But the Goblin?

06:31.054 --> 06:34.432
Now, he is someone
I can make a deal with.

06:34.494 --> 06:38.430
A deal to help me destroy Spider-Man.

06:38.456 --> 06:40.165
Leave my dad alone.

06:40.299 --> 06:42.373
You're just like your father, Harry.

06:43.369 --> 06:45.084
Such spirit.

06:45.371 --> 06:49.458
- I look forward to breaking it.
- Your business is with me.

06:50.443 --> 06:52.770
So it is.

06:53.047 --> 06:56.730
These soldiers are but a
shadow of your former glory.

06:56.836 --> 07:00.537
There was always something
special about the Osborn Goblin.

07:00.850 --> 07:05.688
A certain viciousness. So,
let's bring it out to play.

07:05.713 --> 07:07.580
I saved a dose for you.

07:08.528 --> 07:11.208
No! You can't change him back.
It'll destroy him.

07:11.330 --> 07:12.215
Wrong.

07:12.240 --> 07:17.994
It will allow him to take his natural
place as the head of my Goblin army.

07:22.475 --> 07:25.294
What? My formula cannot fail.

07:25.647 --> 07:29.371
Oh, Octavius.
I developed a cure.

07:29.449 --> 07:34.434
I'm immune now. You can never
turn me into a Goblin again.

07:34.543 --> 07:37.327
Extremely disappointing.

07:38.217 --> 07:41.330
But one Osborn is as good as another.

07:46.138 --> 07:47.588
His lab should be up here.

07:48.367 --> 07:50.256
No!

07:51.298 --> 07:52.552
Leave them alone.

08:01.245 --> 08:04.154
Spider-Man, you're just
in time to watch me

08:04.179 --> 08:07.084
turn Harry Osborn
into the next Goblin.

08:07.109 --> 08:08.550
No!

08:10.789 --> 08:12.075
Get away from him.

08:21.100 --> 08:22.226
I got you, buddy.

08:24.203 --> 08:26.162
Whoa!

08:27.469 --> 08:30.725
Spider-Man, how did you know
Octavius was here?

08:30.750 --> 08:32.948
I didn't. Just horrible timing.

08:32.974 --> 08:35.876
It is time to show this Spider...

08:40.683 --> 08:43.794
I could never stand your speeches.

08:43.878 --> 08:47.017
- You.
- Yeah, me.

09:08.436 --> 09:12.872
You made a monster, Ock. And now
your monster's finally come home.

09:17.466 --> 09:21.482
I created you. I can destroy you.

09:21.981 --> 09:24.662
What did I say about using
lasers inside the house?

09:24.687 --> 09:27.258
If you're gonna play rough,
take it outside.

09:27.867 --> 09:28.833
Ow!

09:31.221 --> 09:33.859
Well, this reunion looks like
it went all kinds of wrong.

09:33.884 --> 09:34.917
Whoa.

09:40.836 --> 09:41.709
Ah!

09:43.613 --> 09:45.150
This ends now, Ock.

09:49.535 --> 09:52.804
Let's see how well I paid attention
to how Scarlet made those bolo-webs.

10:01.494 --> 10:02.380
Close enough.

10:03.588 --> 10:05.889
Maybe the Goblin should open
a chiropractic clinic.

10:06.777 --> 10:07.650
Where's Ock?

10:07.723 --> 10:11.008
I had him on the ropes, but the
coward turned tail and escaped.

10:11.110 --> 10:13.239
We'll find him again. I promise.

10:14.467 --> 10:17.309
But Norman, why'd Ock go
after Harry and not you?

10:17.334 --> 10:18.921
I vaccinated myself.

10:19.185 --> 10:22.497
I promised my son I would never
turn into the Goblin again.

10:22.787 --> 10:24.965
And that's a promise
I intend to keep.

10:24.990 --> 10:28.607
If the vaccine worked on you, could
it change back Ock's Goblin army?

10:28.632 --> 10:32.882
Well, yes. With some modifications,
I believe it could become a cure.

10:32.907 --> 10:34.316
Then let's get to work.

10:39.780 --> 10:42.519
- Here. Put these over your web shooters.
- Web shooters?

10:42.544 --> 10:43.583
What are you talking about?

10:43.608 --> 10:45.609
- My webs are organic.
- Ew.

10:45.878 --> 10:47.653
- Let me see.
- Easy, Spider-nerd.

10:47.890 --> 10:49.868
- Just tell me how to use them.
- Simple.

10:49.893 --> 10:51.624
When we launch the dart,
it'll carry the cure.

10:51.649 --> 10:52.816
Like this.

10:54.626 --> 10:58.508
Now no one has to suffer the
nightmare of being a Goblin.

10:58.533 --> 11:00.412
Ock and HYDRA had us on the run.

11:00.611 --> 11:02.654
Now it's time to take the fight to them.

11:03.353 --> 11:06.401
- Yeah. I don't do high-fives. 
- Figures.

11:10.514 --> 11:12.950
HYDRA's really outdone itself
with that mind-ray.

11:12.975 --> 11:15.162
- It didn't work on me.
- Me either.

11:15.174 --> 11:17.437
But I can't determine
what would cause that.

11:17.532 --> 11:19.862
A frequency that doesn't
affect spiders?

11:19.910 --> 11:23.218
Spider-Man would know.
If he's still alive.

11:23.449 --> 11:25.050
<i>I heard you missed me.</i>

11:26.621 --> 11:29.652
- <i>I'm back.</i>
- Yes. Spidey rules!

11:31.482 --> 11:34.218
Ready to do my friendly
neighborhood wall-crawling thing.

11:36.912 --> 11:38.637
Oh, and I brought a friend.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.683
I'm not your friend!

11:42.742 --> 11:43.917
Some new guy?

11:44.687 --> 11:46.422
His costume's lame.

11:48.074 --> 11:49.240
You had me on the run before.

11:49.285 --> 11:51.786
Let's see how you like it
with two spiders in the house.

12:01.666 --> 12:02.966
Don't worry, Gobby soldiers.

12:02.991 --> 12:05.608
When you wake up, you'll be back
to your normal human selves.

12:11.500 --> 12:13.885
Hey, guys, we're doing you a favor here.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.652
Thumbs up for teamwork.

12:39.992 --> 12:41.226
You'll thank us later.

12:45.661 --> 12:48.056
Isn't "Follow the leader"
supposed to be fun?

13:30.242 --> 13:32.795
It's not working.
These guys are still ugly.

13:33.758 --> 13:34.898
See what I did there?

13:37.922 --> 13:39.783
Whoa-whoa!

13:40.149 --> 13:41.232
Ah!

13:43.492 --> 13:46.420
Oh. Hey, guys. Wouldn't happen
to have a key, would you?

13:46.445 --> 13:49.124
I deduced these cells are
controlled by that generator.

13:49.128 --> 13:50.380
But we can't get to it.

13:51.768 --> 13:54.280
- Scarlet?
- Relax. I got it.

14:01.791 --> 14:02.959
We did it.

14:03.209 --> 14:07.062
Scarlet, you're not gonna like hearing
this, but you and I make a great team.

14:07.087 --> 14:09.259
There's no "I" in team.

14:09.392 --> 14:11.629
I'm only here for myself.

14:11.884 --> 14:14.785
- And Ock.
- Move aside, stinky.

14:14.963 --> 14:19.126
Okay, guys. Let's see HYDRA
even try to stop us now.

14:21.775 --> 14:24.024
Let's do this, S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy.

14:24.502 --> 14:28.740
<i>You are all imprisoned
in more ways than one.</i>

14:34.240 --> 14:37.115
What? It's like we're immune
to Zola's mind-blast.

14:37.140 --> 14:38.455
Spider-Sense.

14:38.662 --> 14:40.211
Maybe somehow it's protecting us.

14:40.246 --> 14:43.018
Then it's up to us to stop Ock and Zola.

14:43.182 --> 14:47.768
- Even this new smelly guy, I guess.
- No. Ock is mine.

14:47.793 --> 14:51.864
You can come along if you want,
just don't get in my way.

14:51.889 --> 14:54.231
Guys, guys, we're
working together here.

14:54.256 --> 14:57.584
Which one of you geniuses
has a way up to HYDRA Island?

14:57.609 --> 14:58.723
This genius.

15:05.204 --> 15:06.714
I recently fabricated it.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.523
I try to maximize my free time.

15:08.712 --> 15:15.013
That is maximum awesome.
Let's call it the Spider Jet.

15:15.047 --> 15:17.048
You just make that name
up all by yourself?

15:17.082 --> 15:18.149
Yes.

15:25.157 --> 15:26.662
Okay, Ock and Zola.

15:26.687 --> 15:30.948
You can try to ruin my day, but don't
mess with the Web Warriors.

15:54.258 --> 15:56.838
You've, uh, flown
this thing before, right?

15:56.872 --> 15:58.773
Technically? No.

15:58.807 --> 16:00.791
I gotta show you how to fly a plane...

16:01.299 --> 16:02.862
If we survive this.

16:09.477 --> 16:13.385
Spider-Man continues to elude you?

16:13.650 --> 16:16.981
This is how you exterminate him.

16:21.988 --> 16:24.277
- It's got a target lock on us.
- Move.

16:45.480 --> 16:51.654
How easily I achieved
that which you could not.

16:57.800 --> 17:00.207
Blasting that missile and
then hiding under the Island?

17:00.232 --> 17:02.698
Where'd you learn
to fly like that, buddy?

17:04.332 --> 17:05.269
I'm not your buddy.

17:05.294 --> 17:09.185
Easy, guys. Let's make like spiders and
crawl into Zola's floating summer home.

17:13.662 --> 17:16.212
Last time I tried to take down
this place, I was alone.

17:16.460 --> 17:18.231
It, kind of, totally failed.

17:18.343 --> 17:20.755
But with you guys?
Now, this is how we do it.

17:20.789 --> 17:23.318
- Do you ever stop talking?
- No.

17:23.343 --> 17:25.022
Let's see if we can find
our way around this place

17:25.061 --> 17:27.162
now that HYDRA changed
the interior design.

17:27.186 --> 17:29.576
I knew Zola
could not have succeeded.

17:29.598 --> 17:32.834
Only the Octopus
can destroy the Spider.

17:32.868 --> 17:34.867
I'm not afraid of you.

17:35.102 --> 17:38.539
You are nothing but a failed experiment.

17:38.574 --> 17:42.586
There's one thing I won't fail at.
And that's bringing you down.

17:42.690 --> 17:43.998
Scarlet, no!

17:49.718 --> 17:51.583
Why are you always so handsy, Ock?

17:54.539 --> 17:57.173
You live? Impossible.

17:57.860 --> 17:59.654
Not if you've seen that guy fly.

18:08.039 --> 18:11.175
Ha. That guy's the worst
TV show ever made.

18:11.200 --> 18:14.277
Just get me cover. I have
to shut down his mind-ray.

18:16.324 --> 18:19.799
Have your new friends seen
what a monster you really are?

18:19.824 --> 18:21.855
You're nothing but a freak.

18:22.518 --> 18:25.690
Says the guy with octopus
arms and a Goblin army.

18:26.136 --> 18:29.391
That sounds like the pot... 
..calling the kettle ugly.

18:32.345 --> 18:35.221
You think you can bind Otto Octavius?

18:35.246 --> 18:38.281
No. But I think I see what
the annoying punk's doing.

18:38.448 --> 18:39.338
Annoying?

18:40.669 --> 18:42.622
No!

18:45.422 --> 18:47.087
I have my own webs.

18:47.112 --> 18:50.083
That is the strangest, "Thank
you, Spidey," I've ever heard.

18:51.108 --> 18:52.959
Time to pull the plug.

19:00.437 --> 19:02.412
<i>You fool.</i>

19:02.451 --> 19:05.041
<i>I am not only this simple machine.</i>

19:06.862 --> 19:10.263
<i>I am all of HYDRA Island.</i>

19:10.599 --> 19:12.667
Venom and Scarlet, take out these guns.

19:12.701 --> 19:16.239
Iron Spider, see if you can override
Zola's control of the system.

19:22.310 --> 19:24.845
<i>I am everywhere!</i>

19:25.781 --> 19:27.279
Everywhere, huh?

19:27.649 --> 19:30.180
Iron Spider, can you access
the hover engines?

19:30.205 --> 19:32.701
Engine systems have
an emergency manual override.

19:32.726 --> 19:35.659
I might get around Zola's
control, but why would...

19:35.858 --> 19:38.960
Oh. You're smarter than you look.

19:48.165 --> 19:51.277
- <i>What are you doing?</i>
- If you're all of HYDRA Island,

19:51.302 --> 19:53.293
then it's also your prison.

19:53.505 --> 19:56.243
Setting a course for beyond Saturn...

19:58.021 --> 20:01.067
No animal can escape the Hunter.

20:01.232 --> 20:04.022
I am not an animal.

20:13.192 --> 20:17.292
With this, I'll be first
member of new Sinister Six.

20:18.116 --> 20:19.988
Leave him alone.

20:20.013 --> 20:21.994
There's a new Sinister Six?

20:23.369 --> 20:24.496
Scarlet!

20:26.557 --> 20:28.319
Let's see if I've learned anything.

20:32.948 --> 20:36.817
<i>Huh? What did you do, Spider-Man?</i>

20:36.919 --> 20:39.685
Text me a selfie
from Saturn's rings, Zola.

20:39.721 --> 20:41.284
But we're trapped here too.

20:41.309 --> 20:43.113
What are you
waiting for, punks?

20:45.107 --> 20:46.312
You came back.

20:46.337 --> 20:47.991
Spiders stick together, right?

20:48.016 --> 20:53.307
<i>Spider-Man, no!</i>

20:58.523 --> 21:00.957
Zola, you are a fool.

21:04.104 --> 21:08.404
Noooo!

21:10.589 --> 21:13.904
I know you're gonna leave, but I
just wanted to say thank you, and...

21:14.831 --> 21:16.090
you're not a monster.

21:16.115 --> 21:18.707
You had my back.
You had all our backs.

21:19.053 --> 21:20.576
That's what a hero does.

21:20.600 --> 21:23.726
Well, I might not head
back to the sewer just yet.

21:24.147 --> 21:26.236
Someone's gotta teach
that kid how to fly.

21:26.272 --> 21:28.168
Any chance you might
take a shower?

21:28.272 --> 21:29.437
Don't push your luck.

21:29.571 --> 21:30.995
Worth a shot.
