ABUELO: Welcome
to Ophidian Island,

01:14.960 --> 01:17.790
the most perfect place
for a vacation

01:17.790 --> 01:20.750
in all the 17 seas.

01:20.750 --> 01:22.960
Sun, sand, and surf!

01:22.960 --> 01:24.540
What more do you need?

01:24.540 --> 01:27.120
Survival gear.
Butterfly net.

01:27.120 --> 01:29.500
Number 2 pencil.
Number 3 pencil.

01:29.500 --> 01:30.790
My guitar-dion.

01:30.790 --> 01:32.710
(grunting)
Just the bare necessities.

01:32.710 --> 01:33.750
(chuckles, sighs)

01:33.750 --> 01:36.080
And, of course,
my Go-Pack!

01:36.080 --> 01:39.710
After we set up camp,
do you girls want
to come hiking with us?

01:39.710 --> 01:43.080
The view from the top
of Mount Ophidia
is breathtaking.

01:43.080 --> 01:45.120
(chuckles)
Thanks, Abuela,

01:45.120 --> 01:48.040
but we've got
other plans.

01:48.040 --> 01:50.290
(tropical music)

02:01.750 --> 02:03.750
All right, Isabel!
Your turn.

02:03.750 --> 02:05.710
Just a second!

02:05.710 --> 02:09.290
I'm calculating
the best dive angle
for a smooth entry.

02:11.920 --> 02:16.920
Isa, the best way
to learn how to dive
is just to dive!

02:16.920 --> 02:18.540
Princess Isabel,
you should know

02:18.540 --> 02:20.290
that besides
being a royal guard,

02:20.290 --> 02:22.920
I'm also
a certified lifeguard,

02:22.920 --> 02:25.040
so you have
nothing to fear...

02:25.040 --> 02:26.920
Gabe is here.

02:26.920 --> 02:30.250
Aw, a gecko!

02:30.250 --> 02:31.750
Gecko? Aah!

02:33.080 --> 02:35.460
Oh, don't be afraid,
little buddy.

02:35.460 --> 02:37.790
Nobody's going
to hurt you.

02:37.790 --> 02:40.880
(coughing) I'm okay!
Everything's okay!

02:40.880 --> 02:42.920
Just pretend
you didn't see that.

02:42.920 --> 02:45.500
See what? How you nearly
mowed down Isabel

02:45.500 --> 02:47.620
to escape a tiny
little lizard?

02:47.620 --> 02:50.920
For the record, I'm not
afraid of anything...

02:50.920 --> 02:54.710
except lizards.
Oh! What was that?!

02:54.710 --> 02:58.290
Oh, hey, there's
a message inside.

02:59.830 --> 03:03.750
I can't believe we found
an actual message in a bottle!

03:03.750 --> 03:07.500
Oh, it looks like a page
from someone's diary.

03:07.500 --> 03:10.580
Listen. "After years
of searching,

03:10.580 --> 03:13.330
at last I have found
the hidden temple.

03:13.330 --> 03:15.710
Inside could be
the greatest treasure

03:15.710 --> 03:17.380
I've ever discovered.

03:17.380 --> 03:19.040
Antonio Agama."

03:19.040 --> 03:22.920
Antonio Agama?
He's one of my all-time heroes.

03:22.920 --> 03:25.790
He's an Avalorn explorer
who sailed all over the world

03:25.790 --> 03:28.500
having adventures,
finding lost treasures,

03:28.500 --> 03:31.540
until he set off
to search for a priceless statue

03:31.540 --> 03:33.960
called the Golden Gecko.

03:33.960 --> 03:36.330
He was never
heard from again.

03:36.330 --> 03:39.040
Until now!
Keep reading.

03:39.040 --> 03:40.920
"The legend says
those who try

03:40.920 --> 03:43.040
to take the statue
will be cursed,

03:43.040 --> 03:45.710
but I've come too far
to turn back,

03:45.710 --> 03:47.330
even if it means..."

03:47.330 --> 03:48.750
Means what?

03:48.750 --> 03:51.210
I don't know.
The ink is smeared.

03:51.210 --> 03:54.540
Hey, there's something
on the back.

03:54.540 --> 03:58.500
It's a map...
of this island!

03:58.500 --> 04:00.880
(chuckles)
Antonio Agama's here!

04:00.880 --> 04:03.040
He must've thrown the bottle
into the ocean,

04:03.040 --> 04:04.830
but the tides
brought it back.

04:04.830 --> 04:06.790
If he tried sending
a message in a bottle,

04:06.790 --> 04:09.420
he must be in trouble
somewhere on this island!

04:09.420 --> 04:10.710
We have to find him.

04:10.710 --> 04:13.920
Wait! First we need
to change and get supplies.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.790
Okay, but let's
make it quick.

04:15.790 --> 04:18.500
Ready. Let's go!

04:18.500 --> 04:20.500
But I'm still packing!

04:20.500 --> 04:23.580
We're going
on a rescue mission,
not a camping trip.

04:23.580 --> 04:25.960
I know, but it's always good
to be prepared.

04:25.960 --> 04:28.960
This book is all
about Ophidian Island.

04:28.960 --> 04:31.790
Okay, Isa, let's get going.

04:35.920 --> 04:37.170
Whoo!

04:40.920 --> 04:42.750
Come on, Isabel!

04:42.750 --> 04:44.380
Ugh...

04:54.580 --> 04:56.710
Whoo-hoo!

04:56.710 --> 04:58.670
(sighs)

05:02.250 --> 05:04.170
(snoring)

05:04.170 --> 05:05.290
Whoa!

05:05.290 --> 05:06.830
Finally.

05:06.830 --> 05:09.920
(startles) I'm awake.
I'm awake.

05:09.920 --> 05:11.500
Come on!

05:27.620 --> 05:29.540
GABE:
That's Antonio Agama's crest!

05:29.540 --> 05:31.330
It must be his boat!

05:31.330 --> 05:32.710
Come on!

05:36.290 --> 05:37.960
He's not here.

05:41.250 --> 05:43.670
Look at these paw prints.

05:43.670 --> 05:44.880
They're huge!

05:44.880 --> 05:49.460
Huh. They lead outside.

05:54.080 --> 05:56.880
What kind of animal
do you think made them?

05:56.880 --> 06:00.540
Well... they look like
gecko prints.

06:00.540 --> 06:03.080
A gecko?
But geckos are tiny.

06:03.080 --> 06:05.460
I know,
it doesn't make sense.

06:05.460 --> 06:06.880
This can't be a gecko.

06:06.880 --> 06:08.880
Then what made
these tracks?

06:08.880 --> 06:11.210
I don't know,
but it was in the boat.

06:11.210 --> 06:13.330
Maybe it took
Señor Agama.

06:13.330 --> 06:16.920
Elena, wait!
Elena, slow down!

06:16.920 --> 06:18.210
What is it?

06:18.210 --> 06:20.710
We have no idea
what this creature is.

06:20.710 --> 06:22.620
We shouldn't just
rush after it.

06:22.620 --> 06:23.750
Did you see that?

06:23.750 --> 06:24.830
See what?

06:24.830 --> 06:25.790
Stay here.

06:33.710 --> 06:36.080
Huh, I guess it was nothing.

06:36.080 --> 06:37.750
(slurp)

06:37.750 --> 06:41.250
Ooh! Run!!!

06:41.250 --> 06:43.880
It's a g-g-gecko!

06:43.880 --> 06:47.120
Gabe, they're just
tiny little liz...ards.

06:47.120 --> 06:48.670
(chitters)

06:48.670 --> 06:50.540
Gabe's right.
We should run!

06:50.540 --> 06:51.540
Go, go, go!

06:55.670 --> 06:57.750
GABE: It's a gecko!
It's a gecko!

06:57.750 --> 07:00.920
It's a big, big gecko!

07:00.920 --> 07:03.920
(panting)

07:05.620 --> 07:07.750
Hey, I think we lost him!

07:07.750 --> 07:09.120
Are you sure?

07:09.120 --> 07:12.170
-Isa, stop!
-(gasps)

07:12.170 --> 07:14.920
Oh! Oh! Whoa.

07:14.920 --> 07:16.790
Oh! That was close.

07:16.790 --> 07:19.000
-(crumbling)
-Isa!

07:19.000 --> 07:20.290
GECKO: Booyah.

07:20.290 --> 07:23.210
(gasps) Isabel?

07:23.210 --> 07:26.380
(chitters)

07:26.380 --> 07:29.830
Get back,
you scaly monster!

07:29.830 --> 07:32.710
Quick!
Hide in this tent.

07:32.710 --> 07:34.120
Gabe, wait!

07:34.120 --> 07:36.170
(gasps) Señor Agama's crest.

07:37.540 --> 07:38.790
(gasps)

07:38.790 --> 07:40.420
The gecko saved her.

07:40.420 --> 07:42.420
Yeah, because he
wants to eat her!

07:42.420 --> 07:44.960
Stop! That's
Antonio Agama!

07:44.960 --> 07:47.380
He was turned
into a giant gecko!

07:47.380 --> 07:50.750
(squeals) Uh-hmm.

07:50.750 --> 07:52.290
Well, how
do you know that?

07:52.290 --> 07:54.460
I found his journal.

07:54.460 --> 07:57.290
Listen to what
Señor Agama wrote.

07:57.290 --> 07:59.330
"The Ophidians warned
that anyone

07:59.330 --> 08:01.880
who dared to take
the Golden Gecko statue

08:01.880 --> 08:04.960
would fall under a curse
and be turned into a gecko,

08:04.960 --> 08:07.380
but I am certain
that it's just a story

08:07.380 --> 08:09.000
to keep people away.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.420
Tomorrow I will descend
into the temple

08:11.420 --> 08:12.920
and find the statue."

08:12.920 --> 08:15.380
So, you're
Señor Agama?

08:15.380 --> 08:16.790
Mm-hmm.

08:16.790 --> 08:19.540
Is there any way
to undo the curse?

08:19.540 --> 08:21.210
(affirmative grunts)

08:25.170 --> 08:27.080
ELENA: We have
to go down there?

08:27.080 --> 08:28.330
Mm-hmm.

08:28.330 --> 08:29.620
It looks dangerous.

08:29.620 --> 08:31.580
You two stay here.
I'll go.

08:31.580 --> 08:33.710
-No way I'm letting
you go alone.
-Me neither!

08:33.710 --> 08:36.790
Even if we all go,
how are we supposed
to get down there?

08:36.790 --> 08:37.920
It's a sheer drop!

08:37.920 --> 08:39.580
Nyah!

08:42.500 --> 08:45.290
Perfect! We'll lower
ourselves in the basket!

08:45.290 --> 08:46.380
I'll grab a torch.

08:46.380 --> 08:47.790
Great! Let's go!

08:48.920 --> 08:51.000
You coming, Señor Agama?

08:51.000 --> 08:52.790
Mm-hmm.

08:53.750 --> 08:54.920
Oh, right!

08:54.920 --> 08:56.750
(chuckles)
He's a gecko.

08:56.750 --> 08:58.710
It looks like we
just pull this rope.

08:58.710 --> 09:00.960
Great! Let's break
this curse!

09:00.960 --> 09:04.670
(grunting)
Oh! It's stuck.

09:04.670 --> 09:06.750
(clanking)

09:06.750 --> 09:10.120
(screaming)

09:10.120 --> 09:12.580
Aah! Sorry.

09:17.750 --> 09:20.290
It says, "The Ophidians
worshipped lizards,

09:20.290 --> 09:21.710
especially the gecko,

09:21.710 --> 09:24.540
and built hidden monuments
on their islands

09:24.540 --> 09:26.420
dedicated to the...

09:26.420 --> 09:28.710
majesty of the gecko!"

09:36.170 --> 09:37.960
ALL: Whoa.

09:41.710 --> 09:42.880
Aah!

09:42.880 --> 09:45.920
Señor Agama, if you
weren't my all-time hero,

09:45.920 --> 09:48.120
I'd really be
freaking out right now.

09:48.120 --> 09:49.420
Uh, Gabe.

09:49.420 --> 09:50.710
Right.

10:05.540 --> 10:07.380
So, which way
do we go?

10:07.380 --> 10:10.540
Señor Agama,
you've been here before.

10:10.540 --> 10:12.380
-(purrs)
-Which way did you go?

10:12.380 --> 10:16.250
Yep. Nyah.

10:26.040 --> 10:28.460
Come on,
let's pick up the pace.

10:28.460 --> 10:30.500
Elena, slow down!

10:30.500 --> 10:33.170
The Ophidians booby-trapped
their temples.

10:33.170 --> 10:36.120
If you step in the wrong place
or touch the wrong thing,

10:36.120 --> 10:38.250
we could get trapped...
or worse!

10:38.250 --> 10:39.750
Don't worry, Isa.

10:39.750 --> 10:41.460
Señor Agama made
it through before.

10:41.460 --> 10:43.290
I'm just stepping
where he stepped.

10:43.290 --> 10:44.500
So it'll be fine--

10:44.500 --> 10:46.920
(rumbling)

10:51.330 --> 10:52.920
GABE: Or not.

10:52.920 --> 10:55.880
Psh, some booby trap.
Didn't even come close!

10:55.880 --> 10:59.250
-Huh?
-Fall back! Fall back!

10:59.250 --> 11:02.250
(screaming)

11:09.750 --> 11:12.460
Elena, I told you
to slow down!

11:12.460 --> 11:15.460
How am I supposed to know
where every booby trap is?

11:15.460 --> 11:17.250
Let's just be more careful.

11:17.250 --> 11:20.750
I will, Isa.
Okay, ready to keep moving?

11:20.750 --> 11:22.920
Ready to set off
another booby trap?

11:22.920 --> 11:23.920
Oh, Gabe.

11:36.170 --> 11:38.960
-ISABEL: Aah!
-GABE: What's happening?

11:38.960 --> 11:40.380
Nothing good.

11:48.710 --> 11:51.540
-(all startle)
-ISABEL: It's retracting!

11:51.540 --> 11:53.500
(gecko chittering)

12:04.710 --> 12:06.330
(grunts)
It won't budge!

12:06.330 --> 12:09.080
We need a key.
Isa, what are you doing?

12:09.080 --> 12:11.750
This is an Ophidian
color pattern puzzle.

12:11.750 --> 12:14.790
We need to solve it
to find the key
that unlocks the door.

12:14.790 --> 12:16.670
Or we could
just try each one.

12:16.670 --> 12:17.920
No, wait!

12:17.920 --> 12:19.670
(gear ratcheting)

12:23.120 --> 12:24.710
Uh, it's moving faster.

12:24.710 --> 12:26.460
You pulled
the wrong key!

12:26.460 --> 12:28.290
Can you solve
the puzzle?

12:28.290 --> 12:29.750
I think so.

12:31.120 --> 12:32.830
Just hurry!

12:32.830 --> 12:35.960
Green, red, blue, blue.
Green, red--

12:35.960 --> 12:37.210
-I got it!
-Great!

12:37.210 --> 12:40.040
It's shifting pairs!
But I better double check.

12:40.040 --> 12:42.830
-What? There's
no time to double check!
-Green, red...

12:42.830 --> 12:45.040
Yup, that green one
should be red!

12:45.040 --> 12:47.710
That's the key!
Oh, no!

12:47.710 --> 12:49.710
-Oh, no, what?
-It's that one!

12:49.710 --> 12:51.580
That one?
But we can't-- Ugh!

12:51.580 --> 12:52.830
What are we
gonna do now?

12:52.830 --> 12:57.500
Hey, Isa, can I see
that book? Hmm. Ugh!

13:00.080 --> 13:02.830
(all quavering)

13:02.830 --> 13:05.540
Oh, no, no, no.

13:05.540 --> 13:07.960
(thuds to a stop)

13:07.960 --> 13:10.290
(all sigh in relief)

13:10.290 --> 13:11.750
-(purring)
-Okay. Okay.

13:11.750 --> 13:12.920
No, really. Quit it.

13:12.920 --> 13:15.750
But we still can't
open the door.

13:15.750 --> 13:19.120
Why didn't Isabel
just grab the key
when she had the chance?

13:19.120 --> 13:21.500
There has to be
another way out of here.

13:21.500 --> 13:23.540
The Ophidians built
secret tunnels

13:23.540 --> 13:24.710
so they could get around

13:24.710 --> 13:26.880
without triggering
their own traps,

13:26.880 --> 13:28.830
but it's too dark
to see anything.

13:28.830 --> 13:30.790
Here.

13:30.790 --> 13:33.540
-ISABEL: Look!
-How do we get down there?

13:33.540 --> 13:36.670
Isabel, you've got some rope
in your Go-Pack, right?

13:36.670 --> 13:37.880
Of course.

13:39.750 --> 13:43.040
(impact grunts)

13:45.880 --> 13:48.460
Watch out!
The floor caved in.

13:49.670 --> 13:51.080
What do we do now?

13:51.080 --> 13:53.920
It's not too far.
We can jump it!

13:55.790 --> 13:57.080
(grunting)

13:57.080 --> 13:59.710
See? Come on!

13:59.710 --> 14:01.540
-(impact grunt)
-Isabel.

14:01.540 --> 14:04.290
I better calculate
how far it is first

14:04.290 --> 14:06.750
to make sure
I can jump it.

14:06.750 --> 14:09.750
Of course you
can make it! Ugh.

14:09.750 --> 14:11.710
(grunts)

14:11.710 --> 14:13.710
Here, we'll jump together!

14:13.710 --> 14:16.500
Fine. But I still think
I should calc--

14:16.500 --> 14:17.920
-Jump!
-(impact grunts)

14:17.920 --> 14:19.000
(cracking)

14:19.000 --> 14:20.790
Oh, no.

14:20.790 --> 14:22.420
Here we go again!

14:22.420 --> 14:24.710
Whoa!

14:25.790 --> 14:29.170
(coughing)

14:29.170 --> 14:30.710
Is everybody okay?

14:30.710 --> 14:31.880
(others coughing)

14:31.880 --> 14:33.750
-Uh-huh.
-We're fine.

14:33.750 --> 14:36.290
Isa, why didn't you just jump
the first time I told you?

14:36.290 --> 14:38.500
I wanted to make sure
I could clear it.

14:38.500 --> 14:41.460
Sometimes you just gotta
trust yourself and go for it.

14:41.460 --> 14:43.580
Hey, guys, look!

14:52.000 --> 14:54.880
Whoa!

14:54.880 --> 14:58.540
ELENA: This must be
the heart of the temple.

15:01.540 --> 15:04.750
GABE: What's he
trying to tell us?

15:04.750 --> 15:06.620
There must be
something in there.

15:06.620 --> 15:08.750
-I'll check it out!
-Elena, wait!

15:08.750 --> 15:12.000
The floor might
be booby trapped.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.920
(purrs)

15:13.920 --> 15:15.750
I guess it wasn't.

15:15.750 --> 15:18.170
It's the Golden Gecko statue!

15:18.170 --> 15:20.920
(chittering)

15:20.920 --> 15:23.920
Oh, you can't reach it.

15:23.920 --> 15:24.750
Uh-uh.

15:24.750 --> 15:28.170
Hang on. Unh!

15:28.170 --> 15:30.880
Almost... there!

15:31.920 --> 15:33.920
Got it!

15:33.920 --> 15:36.080
It needs to go
back up on the pedestal?

15:36.080 --> 15:37.330
Yah!

15:37.330 --> 15:39.790
Hey, I know how
to reverse the curse!

15:39.790 --> 15:41.960
(thud, gears whirring)

15:41.960 --> 15:43.380
Uhh...

15:43.380 --> 15:46.830
(all quavering)

15:51.540 --> 15:52.960
Isa, get out of here!

15:52.960 --> 15:55.380
But what if I step
on another booby trap?

15:55.380 --> 15:56.750
-Run!
-Isabel!

15:56.750 --> 15:59.710
Gabe! Uh... oh...

16:02.580 --> 16:05.670
(both screaming)

16:05.670 --> 16:07.830
Uh, oh!

16:07.830 --> 16:10.790
We're trapped!

16:10.790 --> 16:14.960
Just great! Everything
is crumbling around here
except this wall!

16:14.960 --> 16:17.750
I told you there
could be booby traps!

16:17.750 --> 16:19.750
If you had just
taken your time,

16:19.750 --> 16:21.710
you wouldn't have
set them off.

16:21.710 --> 16:23.920
Isa, it was an accident.

16:23.920 --> 16:26.120
Well, you wouldn't have
so many accidents

16:26.120 --> 16:28.290
if you weren't always
in a hurry, you know,

16:28.290 --> 16:29.750
leaping before you look.

16:29.750 --> 16:31.170
It's better than stopping

16:31.170 --> 16:33.540
and double-checking
every single little thing.

16:33.540 --> 16:35.420
It's been slowing us
down all day,

16:35.420 --> 16:37.580
and it's the reason
we're stuck in here.

16:37.580 --> 16:41.620
Hmph! (sniffling)

16:44.330 --> 16:47.920
(sighs) Isa.
I didn't mean that.

16:47.920 --> 16:49.790
Yes, you did.

16:51.380 --> 16:53.330
Look, I'm sorry.

16:53.330 --> 16:56.120
It's just we have
different ways
of doing things,

16:56.120 --> 16:58.830
and, you know, sometimes
your way's better

16:58.830 --> 17:00.210
and sometimes
my way is,

17:00.210 --> 17:06.250
but us arguing isn't
gonna solve anything.

17:06.250 --> 17:11.830
(sniffs) You're right.
I'm sorry, too.

17:13.620 --> 17:17.040
I wish I could walk on walls
like a gecko right about now.

17:17.040 --> 17:21.580
(gasps) Maybe we can.

17:23.210 --> 17:26.080
Okay, now press your feet
against the wall.

17:27.210 --> 17:29.420
Good. If my calculations
are correct,

17:29.420 --> 17:31.540
all we have to do
is push against each other

17:31.540 --> 17:34.000
with enough force that we can
walk our way up the wall.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.750
(grunting, laughing)

17:36.750 --> 17:38.880
Hey, it's working!

17:40.920 --> 17:42.040
Wait!

17:42.040 --> 17:43.290
Whoa-ah!

17:43.290 --> 17:45.380
We have to go
at the same pace.

17:45.380 --> 17:47.420
Right. You got it.

17:47.420 --> 17:48.790
Let's try again.

17:52.710 --> 17:54.540
Grab the edge!

17:57.250 --> 17:58.830
Great idea, Isa.

18:01.750 --> 18:02.620
Look!

18:08.120 --> 18:10.460
Uh, guys!

18:10.460 --> 18:14.540
Hold on, Gabe.
We've gotta help
Señor Agama first.

18:22.710 --> 18:23.790
Ay-ay, here.

18:25.830 --> 18:27.120
Here you go. Uhh!

18:30.080 --> 18:31.710
Oh!

18:34.290 --> 18:35.880
(gasps)

18:40.880 --> 18:44.540
Ha ha!
I am myself again!

18:44.540 --> 18:46.380
(sighs of relief)

18:46.380 --> 18:48.750
BOTH: Whoa! Aah!

18:57.080 --> 18:58.580
Are you okay?

18:58.580 --> 18:59.880
Yes!

18:59.880 --> 19:01.620
Thank you, Señor Agama.

19:01.620 --> 19:03.210
No, thank you!

19:03.210 --> 19:05.120
That was
the second-worst animal

19:05.120 --> 19:07.830
a cursed treasure
ever turned me into.

19:07.830 --> 19:09.210
What was the first?

19:09.210 --> 19:11.460
Brr! You don't want to know.

19:11.460 --> 19:13.830
I say we get out of here
before one of you

19:13.830 --> 19:15.750
sets off another
booby trap. Uhh!

19:15.750 --> 19:17.540
Huh?

19:17.540 --> 19:20.380
You gotta be kidding me!
What now?

19:21.460 --> 19:23.920
The temple is
sealing itself shut.

19:25.420 --> 19:28.380
Hurry, through that tunnel!
It's the only way out!

19:28.380 --> 19:30.540
My Go-Pack!

19:30.540 --> 19:32.380
Keep going!
I'll grab it.

19:40.750 --> 19:41.830
Elena!

19:53.000 --> 19:55.790
Keep going!
Keep going!

19:58.210 --> 20:00.000
What?

20:01.710 --> 20:03.540
Get ready to jump!

20:03.540 --> 20:05.710
Aah!

20:05.710 --> 20:09.330
Isabel!

20:09.330 --> 20:10.380
Jump!

20:10.380 --> 20:12.670
No! Oh!

20:12.670 --> 20:13.540
Isa!

20:21.750 --> 20:22.920
Gotcha!

20:24.920 --> 20:27.540
Oh! Way to calculate
that jump!

20:27.540 --> 20:29.500
I didn't
calculate anything!

20:29.500 --> 20:33.120
Sometimes, you just
gotta go for it.

20:37.580 --> 20:38.920
(chuckles)

20:38.920 --> 20:41.670
I guess some treasures
aren't meant to be taken.

20:41.670 --> 20:42.710
That's okay.

20:42.710 --> 20:44.420
We already have a treasure

20:44.420 --> 20:46.420
more valuable
than any statue.

20:46.420 --> 20:47.830
We sure do.

20:47.830 --> 20:50.750
We rescued
Antonio Agama,

20:50.750 --> 20:54.670
the greatest adventurer
in all of Avalor!

20:56.830 --> 20:59.540
(chuckles)
What an adventure we had!

20:59.540 --> 21:01.080
You should've come with us

21:01.080 --> 21:03.880
instead of lounging around
all day on the beach.

21:03.880 --> 21:06.040
Hey, I found us
some dessert!

21:06.040 --> 21:07.750
Who is this?

21:10.170 --> 21:14.540
Antonio Agama,
at your service.

21:14.540 --> 21:17.880
I heard you've been
missing for years.

21:17.880 --> 21:19.960
And I might've
stayed missing

21:19.960 --> 21:22.880
if it wasn't for
these three young heroes.

21:30.880 --> 21:32.080
Huh?

21:35.920 --> 21:37.830
Hey, there's
something in here.

21:37.830 --> 21:39.710
It's another message!

21:39.710 --> 21:41.710
Let me look at that.

21:41.710 --> 21:43.710
-Hmm, mm-hmm.
-Gabe!

21:45.880 --> 21:47.290
You'll thank me later.

21:47.290 --> 21:49.580
But what if someone else
is in trouble?

21:49.580 --> 21:50.830
Don't worry, princess,

21:50.830 --> 21:53.210
I think I just found
my next adventure!

21:53.210 --> 21:54.250
Ha ha!
