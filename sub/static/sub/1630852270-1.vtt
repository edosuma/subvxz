07:47.801 --> 07:49.654
You're driving me to my grave,
ya pack of jackals.

07:49.678 --> 07:50.947
Watch yourself, sergeant krupke,

07:50.971 --> 07:52.032
you're gonna inflame your asthma,

07:52.056 --> 07:53.376
- shouting like that.
- (Laughter)

07:53.557 --> 07:55.976
Why don't you leave
the Puerto Ricans alone, riff?

07:56.060 --> 07:58.228
Christ almighty. And you lot,

07:59.188 --> 08:00.397
you're in New York now.

08:00.481 --> 08:01.961
You got a problem, you call the cops.

08:02.024 --> 08:03.901
Youse can't play
at being cops yourselves.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.862
Pero we call the cops,
you show up and arrest us!

08:06.945 --> 08:08.906
You're never around
when these hijueputas

08:08.989 --> 08:10.741
mess up our stores and our streets.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.785
See, I get confused
when you say "our streets,"

08:12.868 --> 08:14.620
seeing how these streets
are ours by right

08:14.703 --> 08:16.330
- of being born here, amigo.
- The jets!

08:16.413 --> 08:18.582
(All arguing indistinctly)

08:18.666 --> 08:20.709
How many times do I gotta tell you,
Bernardo?

08:20.793 --> 08:22.086
I don't speak spic.

08:22.169 --> 08:23.796
- (Squabbhng)

- (Whistle blowing)
- Come on! Break it up!

08:32.054 --> 08:34.932
Jesus wept, baby John.

08:35.599 --> 08:37.851
Who did that to your ear?

08:41.730 --> 08:43.732
Which one of them nailed you?

08:50.614 --> 08:52.616
Who cracked your head open, hombre?

08:52.700 --> 08:54.535
- (Speaks Spanish)
- In English.

08:56.328 --> 08:58.831
Same guy who nailed your ear, maybe?

09:01.208 --> 09:03.377
Maybe. I don't remember.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.045
I realise if any of you helps me out,

09:05.129 --> 09:07.339
you might spoil your chance
to murder each other

09:07.423 --> 09:09.925
over control of this earthly paradise.

09:10.008 --> 09:12.136
The jets control it and you know it.

09:12.594 --> 09:13.595
Uh-huh, yeah,

09:13.679 --> 09:15.514
but, golly gee, Balkan, not according

09:15.597 --> 09:17.933
to the New York City committee
for slum clearance,

09:18.016 --> 09:20.352
which has decided
to pull this whole hellmouth

09:20.436 --> 09:21.603
down to the bedrock,

09:21.687 --> 09:23.355
and you're in the way.

09:23.814 --> 09:26.483
Aah! (Shuddering)

09:28.527 --> 09:29.820
(Whistles)

09:31.864 --> 09:33.949
Nice reflexes, muchacho.

09:34.116 --> 09:35.993
So, any day now,

09:36.076 --> 09:37.536
all of you are gonna be evicted.

09:37.619 --> 09:39.997
You'll have to "vamoose,"
as we say in Spanish.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.331
We're not relocating.

09:41.415 --> 09:42.541
(Man speaks Spanish)

09:42.624 --> 09:43.959
We have rights.

09:44.376 --> 09:47.421
Rights, huh? Where are they?

09:47.504 --> 09:48.815
- (Bernardo growls)
- (Speaks Spanish)

09:48.839 --> 09:51.175
You back down, Bernardo.
Don't be stupid.

09:54.511 --> 09:57.097
Some night, muchacho,

09:58.140 --> 09:59.808
maybe you'll get to see me fight.

09:59.892 --> 10:02.311
'Course, you'll have to leave
your gun at home, lieutenant.

10:04.563 --> 10:07.608
Evict yourself off my crime scene,
Bernardo.

10:09.610 --> 10:10.861
Vamos.

10:16.033 --> 10:18.035
(Jets taunting)

10:18.243 --> 10:19.828
Jets member: Chick, chick, chick.

10:19.912 --> 10:22.706
(Jets member 2 whistles tauntingly)

10:22.790 --> 10:24.225
Jets member: Chickie, chickie, chickie.

10:24.249 --> 10:26.251
(Singing in Spanish)

10:30.798 --> 10:33.091
- (Jets snickering)
- A boxer and a singer.

10:33.175 --> 10:34.611
Jets member 3: Get a load of this guy.

10:34.635 --> 10:37.137
(Continues singing in Spanish)

10:39.515 --> 10:41.058
(Jets laughing)

10:41.141 --> 10:43.393
(All singing)

10:48.982 --> 10:50.818
You want me to book
the whole bunch of you?

10:50.901 --> 10:52.903
Keep up the serenade and see what...

10:52.986 --> 10:54.988
(Singing continues)

10:57.407 --> 10:59.785
[Viva Puerto Rico iibre!

10:59.868 --> 11:02.955
I am ordering you clowns to disperse!

11:05.833 --> 11:06.834
Now!

11:06.917 --> 11:09.044
(All continue singing)

11:18.220 --> 11:19.972
(Crowd cheering)

11:23.100 --> 11:24.852
We're outnumbered, boys.

11:24.935 --> 11:26.895
Thousands more are on their way,

11:26.979 --> 11:28.188
and once they're here,

11:28.272 --> 11:30.816
they pop out kids like crazy.
Am I right?

11:31.358 --> 11:33.485
Tell me which one of them
nailed baby John's ear

11:33.569 --> 11:35.237
and I'll put him out of circulation.

11:35.779 --> 11:36.905
Work with me, fellas.

11:36.989 --> 11:38.466
Or they're gonna drive you
off your turf.

11:38.490 --> 11:40.409
You said it was
the slum clearance committee

11:40.492 --> 11:41.535
that was driving us off,

11:41.618 --> 11:43.036
now it's the prs.

11:43.120 --> 11:45.706
You gotta get your story straight,
lieutenant schrank.

11:45.789 --> 11:47.541
We're very impressionable.

11:48.542 --> 11:50.460
Most of the white guys
who grew up in this slum

11:50.544 --> 11:51.670
climbed their way out of it.

11:51.753 --> 11:54.089
Irish, Italian, Jews.

11:54.172 --> 11:56.425
Nowadays, their descendants
live in nice houses

11:56.508 --> 11:58.135
and drive nice cars

11:58.218 --> 12:01.054
and date nice girls you'd want to marry.

12:01.138 --> 12:04.349
Your dads or your granddads stayed put,

12:04.975 --> 12:07.519
drinking and knocking up
some local piece

12:07.603 --> 12:09.313
who gave birth to you.

12:10.439 --> 12:13.942
The last of the
can't-make-it caucasians.

12:14.109 --> 12:17.237
What's a gang without its terrain,
its turf?

12:17.321 --> 12:19.072
You're a month or two away
from finding out,

12:19.156 --> 12:20.991
one step ahead of the wrecking ball.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.534
And in this uncertain world,

12:22.618 --> 12:25.621
the only thing you can count on is me.

12:25.704 --> 12:27.205
I'm here to keep the civil peace

12:27.289 --> 12:28.624
until the last building falls.

12:28.707 --> 12:30.000
And if you boys make trouble

12:30.083 --> 12:32.044
on my turf, riff, hand to heart,

12:32.127 --> 12:34.004
you're headed to an upstate prison cell

12:34.087 --> 12:35.964
for a very long time.

12:37.299 --> 12:38.842
By the time you get out,

12:40.177 --> 12:43.138
this will be a shiny new neighbourhood
of rich people

12:43.221 --> 12:45.390
in beautiful apartments

12:46.016 --> 12:50.312
with puerto rican doormen
to chase trash like you away.

12:54.733 --> 12:55.734
Wait!

12:58.612 --> 13:00.656
I got a question for you, lieutenant.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.494
How tall did you used to be before you,

13:05.577 --> 13:06.912
you know, "schrank"?

13:06.995 --> 13:08.497
(Jets laughing)

13:09.247 --> 13:10.666
Come on, sergeant, ride with me.

13:10.749 --> 13:12.042
Long as I know you, riff,

13:12.125 --> 13:14.086
you ain't had the sense,
god gave a pigeon.

13:17.214 --> 13:19.216
Riff: Come here, let's see what he done.

13:20.884 --> 13:21.885
Come on.

13:23.512 --> 13:24.906
Well, that's gonna scar, buddy boy.

13:24.930 --> 13:27.641
- You think so? (Chuckles)
- Frankenstein time.

13:27.724 --> 13:29.184
They can't make us up and leave.

13:29.267 --> 13:30.268
We're here, ain't we?

13:30.352 --> 13:32.813
American citizens,
which them spics ain't!

13:32.896 --> 13:34.231
Them they can chase off, not us.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.416
Puerto Ricans are Americans,

13:35.440 --> 13:36.960
- you ignoramus.
- Ah, go eat a green banana!

13:36.984 --> 13:39.003
Puerto Rico's like a state,
ain't it? So, deez is right...

13:39.027 --> 13:40.088
Baby John: No, it's something else.

13:40.112 --> 13:41.339
Jets member: There are only 48 states,

13:41.363 --> 13:42.590
- ya dead battery.
- What do you know?

13:42.614 --> 13:43.949
- (Laughter)
- Whatever they are,

13:44.032 --> 13:46.660
citizens or who gives a fart,
what we know is...

13:46.743 --> 13:48.412
Jets member 2: They ain't us.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.789
So, spill it, krazy Kat,
what are you thinking?

13:50.872 --> 13:52.249
(Metal clinks)

13:52.332 --> 13:55.293
I'm thinking it's past time
for a rumble.

13:55.877 --> 13:58.547
For a all-in, all-out, once-and-for-all,

13:58.630 --> 14:00.882
winner-takes-all, high-noon-shootout-

14:00.966 --> 14:03.006
- at-the-o.k. Corral rumble!
- (All shout excitedly)

14:03.051 --> 14:05.095
Balkan: Wild blue yonder! About time!

14:05.178 --> 14:06.572
We do 'em like we done
the Egyptian kings.

14:06.596 --> 14:08.076
- And the emeralds.
- And the bishops.

14:08.265 --> 14:09.701
Alright, so Tony and me
will sit down with...

14:09.725 --> 14:10.994
- Jets member: Tony?
- Yeah, Tony.

14:11.018 --> 14:12.120
Jets member 2:
What's this got to do with him?

14:12.144 --> 14:13.454
He ain't stood with us
once since he got out.

14:13.478 --> 14:15.480
He's on parole.
He's gotta be careful, is all.

14:15.564 --> 14:16.749
He cannot be running around...

14:16.773 --> 14:18.233
Tony's done with the jets, riff.

14:18.316 --> 14:20.444
He ain't done with the jets.
Like that's even a thing!

14:20.527 --> 14:21.879
You cannot be done with this family.

14:21.903 --> 14:24.281
Maybe it wasn't a thing before,
but now, riff?

14:24.698 --> 14:26.199
The lieutenant's right.

14:26.283 --> 14:28.118
What are the jets
if we got no territory?

14:28.201 --> 14:29.429
- Jets member: That's right!
- All: Yeah.

14:29.453 --> 14:32.080
Schrank doesn't know
his ass from his elbow.

14:32.664 --> 14:33.707
Look,

14:33.790 --> 14:36.460
Tony and me started the jets

14:36.543 --> 14:37.895
cause none of us would even be here

14:37.919 --> 14:39.212
if it wasn't for all of us.

14:39.588 --> 14:41.348
- And all you know it.
- (Jazz music playing)

14:41.423 --> 14:44.301
(Singing) When you're a jet
you're a jet all the way

14:44.384 --> 14:47.637
from your first cigarette
to your last dyin' day

14:48.221 --> 14:50.974
when you're a jet
if the spit hits the fan

14:51.058 --> 14:54.644
you got brothers around
you're a family man

14:54.728 --> 14:56.063
you're never alone

14:56.354 --> 14:57.981
you're never disconnected

14:58.690 --> 15:00.400
you're home with your own

15:00.484 --> 15:02.027
when company's expected

15:02.110 --> 15:03.862
you're well-protected

15:03.945 --> 15:06.823
then you are set with a capital j

15:06.907 --> 15:10.077
which you'll never forget
till they cart you away

15:10.160 --> 15:11.161
when you're a jet

15:11.244 --> 15:13.705
- (tyres screech rhythmically)
- You stay a

15:14.081 --> 15:16.917
-jet -(Cars horns honking)

15:18.585 --> 15:20.879
So, meet Tony and me
at the dog days dance

15:20.962 --> 15:21.963
at the gym tonight.

15:22.047 --> 15:24.216
We can't rumble at the gym,
it'll be lousy with cops!

15:24.299 --> 15:25.651
And maybe we've had enough trouble

15:25.675 --> 15:26.903
with the Puerto Ricans for one day?

15:26.927 --> 15:29.262
Relax. It's a social mixer.

15:29.346 --> 15:31.848
So we'll mix until the time's right

15:31.932 --> 15:33.892
to fix the rumble for tomorrow night.

15:34.184 --> 15:36.436
Be there 10:00 pm, punctual-like,

15:36.520 --> 15:38.271
dressed to kill, walking tall!

15:38.355 --> 15:40.148
We always walk tall! We're jets!

15:40.315 --> 15:41.775
The greatest.

15:42.109 --> 15:44.861
(Singing) When you're a jet
you're the top cat in town

15:44.945 --> 15:48.740
you're the gold-medal kid
with the heavyweight crown

15:48.824 --> 15:49.908
when you're a jet

15:49.991 --> 15:53.286
you're the swingin'est thing
little boy, you're a man

15:53.370 --> 15:55.330
jets: Little man you're a king

15:55.413 --> 15:56.748
riff: The jets are in gear

15:56.832 --> 15:59.084
our cylinders are clickin'

15:59.584 --> 16:01.128
the sharks'll steer clear

16:01.211 --> 16:04.214
jets: Cause every
puerto rican's a lousy chicken

16:04.714 --> 16:07.425
here come the jets
like a bat out of hell

16:07.509 --> 16:10.720
someone gets in our way
someone don't feel so well

16:11.346 --> 16:14.099
here come the jets
little world, step aside

16:14.182 --> 16:15.851
better go underground

16:15.934 --> 16:17.477
better run, better hide

16:17.978 --> 16:21.523
we 're drawin' the line
so keep your noses hidden

16:22.107 --> 16:25.277
we 're hangin' a sign
says "visitors forbidden"

16:25.360 --> 16:26.945
and we ain't kiddin'

16:27.195 --> 16:30.115
jets: Here come the jets, yeah
and we're gonna beat

16:30.198 --> 16:33.410
every last buggin' gang
on the whole buggin' street

16:33.493 --> 16:34.828
on the whole

16:34.911 --> 16:37.205
ever mother-lo vin'

16:37.289 --> 16:42.836
street

16:42.919 --> 16:44.462
- yeah!
- (Music ends)

16:49.301 --> 16:50.760
- Can.
- Riff: Come on.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.345
Just for an hour, only a little hour.

16:52.429 --> 16:53.722
You used to like dancing.

16:53.805 --> 16:55.557
- No monkeyshines.
- Come on, riff, can.

16:57.225 --> 16:59.853
Christ almighty. You know,
there's dust on everything.

16:59.936 --> 17:00.937
You know, ever since...

17:01.021 --> 17:02.564
Hey, I swear on what's holy,

17:02.647 --> 17:05.483
it is just girls sipping punch
and music...

17:05.567 --> 17:06.794
- And the sharks.
- And the spics.

17:06.818 --> 17:07.962
- And a rumble.
- Which all you gotta do...

17:07.986 --> 17:09.046
You're on your own, pal-o-mine.

17:09.069 --> 17:10.256
Is help me haggle
over the terms of the rumble.

17:10.280 --> 17:11.757
You don't need me helping ya
screw up your life.

17:11.781 --> 17:13.509
You know how I get.
I will start runnin' my mouth.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.410
You... you got command.

17:15.492 --> 17:17.704
You are West Side legendary! And, Tony,

17:17.787 --> 17:21.374
Tony, the jets.
I gave 'em my word you'd show.

17:22.459 --> 17:24.461
- Why would you do that?
- Because...

17:24.961 --> 17:26.296
Because it's a rumble!

17:26.378 --> 17:27.839
We need you if we're going to war.

17:27.923 --> 17:30.759
You can't refuse us now.
And because I know you.

17:31.218 --> 17:32.219
Or I thought I did,

17:32.302 --> 17:33.613
before you got all unlike yourself,

17:33.637 --> 17:35.305
before you went upstate.

17:35.597 --> 17:37.641
Woman: Tony? (Speaks Spanish)

17:37.724 --> 17:39.476
I'm coming!

17:43.271 --> 17:44.540
It's like you're still in prison,

17:44.564 --> 17:46.441
and the old witch is the warden.

17:48.151 --> 17:51.112
She gave me a job and a place to stay.

17:51.196 --> 17:54.282
She's always been there
for me, like nobody else.

17:54.366 --> 17:56.010
- Oh, nobody, huh? Thanks, pal.
- So don't call her...

17:56.034 --> 17:57.094
Thanks a big fat lot. Yeah.

17:57.118 --> 17:59.162
You know I didn't mean you wasn't there.

17:59.246 --> 18:00.747
You was always there.

18:02.958 --> 18:04.417
- Womb to tomb.
- Sperm to worm.

18:04.501 --> 18:07.087
So, come with me to the dance, huh?

18:07.170 --> 18:08.421
Come on.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.220
Is it graziella? That what's eatin' you?

18:15.303 --> 18:16.447
No, it ain't grazie. (Chuckles)

18:16.471 --> 18:17.573
She said that you and she was done.

18:17.597 --> 18:18.658
It's good that
you're keeping her company.

18:18.682 --> 18:19.825
Even before you got locked up, you know?

18:19.849 --> 18:22.227
It's cool. Don't get all
the way you get.

18:23.436 --> 18:27.565
Grazie's a great girl,
and the jets are the greatest.

18:27.649 --> 18:31.069
And you, you're like,
you know, blood to me.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.077
But I'm scared of myself, riff.

18:41.871 --> 18:44.582
What I done to that kid.
What I almost done.

18:44.666 --> 18:46.042
You gotta get over that.

18:46.126 --> 18:47.726
What is the point
in beating yourself up?

18:47.794 --> 18:50.880
I wanna be unlike how I was.

18:50.964 --> 18:52.757
Cause I was disappearing down a sewer

18:52.841 --> 18:53.985
and taking you and everything with me.

18:54.009 --> 18:55.927
- Woman: Tony, you coming?
- Yeah, he heard ya!

18:56.011 --> 18:58.847
I had time. Lots of it.

18:59.180 --> 19:00.849
Locked up like that,

19:01.683 --> 19:06.980
and for the first time ever,
I took a look inside,

19:07.147 --> 19:09.649
and that was rough, doing that,

19:10.066 --> 19:13.194
but I... I gotta stay with myself.

19:14.863 --> 19:17.949
You know what I mean? Maybe stay...

19:19.492 --> 19:21.077
By myself, just for...

19:21.161 --> 19:22.162
Yeah, you know what?

19:22.245 --> 19:23.747
You're just too deep for me, kid.

19:24.622 --> 19:26.666
You know, I don't know who I am.

19:26.750 --> 19:27.876
And who cares who I am?

19:27.959 --> 19:29.502
Nobody, including me.

19:29.586 --> 19:31.171
I know that this dust

19:31.254 --> 19:32.797
that's covering everything right now,

19:32.922 --> 19:35.091
that's the four-story buildings
that was standing here

19:35.175 --> 19:37.135
when you went upstate a year ago.

19:37.469 --> 19:39.512
You know, I wake up to everything I know

19:39.596 --> 19:41.056
either getting sold or wrecked,

19:41.139 --> 19:43.808
or being taken over by people
that I don't like.

19:43.892 --> 19:45.101
And they don't like me.

19:45.185 --> 19:47.437
And you know what's left
out of all that?

19:48.271 --> 19:49.856
The jets.

19:50.398 --> 19:54.486
My guys. My guys, who are just like me.

19:56.363 --> 19:57.781
Who are just like you.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.574
I can't go to the dance, riff!

19:59.657 --> 20:02.160
My parole officer said no going out!

20:08.583 --> 20:10.460
I told you I don't want you in my store.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.212
I'm a paying customer.

20:13.588 --> 20:15.757
You've been stealing from me
since you were six.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.467
Now, get out. I mean it.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.345
And leave Tony alone.

20:20.512 --> 20:23.306
He is not allowed to associate
with criminals.

20:23.390 --> 20:24.891
Look, don't fall off that ladder.

20:24.974 --> 20:27.977
At your age, brittle bones.
That's all I'm saying.

20:28.061 --> 20:29.771
Woman: You'll pay for that candy.

20:29.854 --> 20:32.524
Five cents. On the counter!

20:33.358 --> 20:36.194
Stand me for a milky way, huh?
Least you could do.

20:37.445 --> 20:38.988
Womb to tomb

20:39.406 --> 20:41.491
wasn't never a joke for me.

20:41.783 --> 20:43.052
- Don't be like that.
- (Door closes)

20:43.076 --> 20:45.245
Just cause I can't go to a dance?

20:46.329 --> 20:51.084
Tony, I don't tell you
who to hang out with. But...

20:51.167 --> 20:55.672
(Imitates her) "But those
boys are juvenile delinquent.

20:56.673 --> 20:59.259
"They're no good for you.
And you better watch out."

20:59.342 --> 21:00.510
Hey.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.393
(Imitates him)
"You make fun of the way I talk

21:02.470 --> 21:04.030
- "one more time, blondie..."
- (Snorts)

21:04.931 --> 21:07.183
(In normal tone) I'm gonna
talk to riff and tell him

21:07.267 --> 21:08.987
that he can't just
come in here and not pay.

21:10.145 --> 21:12.272
Tony, wake up.

21:12.355 --> 21:16.401
I know you love riff,
but he hates Puerto Ricans.

21:16.484 --> 21:17.777
That is not you.

21:17.861 --> 21:19.154
Riff don't hate you.

21:19.821 --> 21:22.240
I married a gringo.

21:22.699 --> 21:24.409
He thinks that makes me a gringa,

21:24.492 --> 21:26.536
which it don't. And I ain't.

21:28.580 --> 21:30.748
Well, it's guys like riff and me,

21:30.832 --> 21:32.876
when things ain't familiar,

21:32.959 --> 21:35.753
we just got this instinct to,
you know...

21:37.589 --> 21:38.923
You...

21:39.299 --> 21:43.344
Even as an angry little boy,
somehow there was this...

21:43.428 --> 21:47.140
This promise
that you couldn't keep hidden.

21:47.223 --> 21:49.267
Not from you.

21:49.434 --> 21:53.521
And sometimes, I see you smiling,

21:55.023 --> 21:56.524
like you're waiting for the,

21:56.608 --> 21:58.776
what do you call, Irish sweepstakes,

21:58.860 --> 22:01.696
instead of sweeping the floor
like I pay you to do.

22:02.322 --> 22:03.573
I sweep as good as you pay.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.450
- Yeah?
- Look it.

22:05.950 --> 22:08.286
(Gasps) Ooh.

22:12.415 --> 22:15.418
You see? Promise.

22:15.502 --> 22:18.463
You bring dead floors back to life.

22:19.589 --> 22:20.590
(Tony sighs)

22:20.673 --> 22:23.218
Keep looking for better, mi milagro.

22:23.885 --> 22:26.179
Like you always done.

22:27.055 --> 22:29.474
(Jazz music intro playing softly)

22:30.099 --> 22:31.351
(Sighs)

22:37.440 --> 22:41.027
(Singing) Could be?

22:41.194 --> 22:43.446
Who knows?

22:44.906 --> 22:48.993
There's something due any day
I will know right away

22:49.077 --> 22:52.914
soon as it shows

22:52.997 --> 22:54.433
-it may come cannonballing
-(Gasps) Aah!

22:54.457 --> 22:56.042
Down through the sky
gleam in its eye

22:56.125 --> 22:59.254
-bright as a Rose -(Laughs)

22:59.837 --> 23:02.757
Who knows?

23:03.591 --> 23:07.845
It's only just out of reach
down the block, on a beach

23:07.929 --> 23:11.140
under a tree

23:11.766 --> 23:13.685
I got a feeling there's a miracle due

23:13.768 --> 23:14.769
gonna come true

23:14.852 --> 23:19.482
coming to me

23:20.400 --> 23:22.777
could it be? Yes, it could

23:22.860 --> 23:25.280
something's coming
something good

23:25.363 --> 23:27.740
if I can wait

23:27.824 --> 23:30.952
something's coming
I don't know what it is

23:31.035 --> 23:35.039
but it is gonna be great

23:35.123 --> 23:37.458
with a click, with a shock

23:37.542 --> 23:40.128
phone'll jingle, door'll knock

23:40.211 --> 23:42.547
open the latch

23:42.630 --> 23:44.757
something's coming
don't know when

23:44.841 --> 23:46.634
but it's soon catch the moon

23:46.718 --> 23:49.345
one-handed catch

23:49.429 --> 23:54.392
around the corner

23:54.475 --> 23:59.564
or whistling down the river

23:59.647 --> 24:04.193
come on, deliver

24:04.277 --> 24:09.073
to me

24:09.741 --> 24:12.201
will it be? Yes, it will

24:12.285 --> 24:14.746
maybe just by holding still

24:14.829 --> 24:16.956
it'll be there

24:17.290 --> 24:19.500
come on, something come on in

24:19.584 --> 24:21.461
don't be shy meet a guy

24:21.544 --> 24:24.213
pull up a chair

24:24.297 --> 24:29.218
the air is humming

24:29.302 --> 24:33.306
and something great is coming

24:35.308 --> 24:38.936
who knows?

24:39.020 --> 24:43.358
It's only just out of reach
down the block, on a beach

24:43.441 --> 24:46.944
maybe tonight

24:47.028 --> 24:50.698
maybe tonight

24:50.782 --> 24:55.787
maybe tonight

25:00.124 --> 25:01.167
(music ends)

25:05.213 --> 25:06.214
(Neighbours chattering)

25:06.297 --> 25:08.508
(Siren wailing in distance)

25:10.093 --> 25:11.344
Woman: Maria!

25:19.852 --> 25:22.188
Maria! (Speaks Spanish)

25:22.271 --> 25:24.607
They're gonna be here in five minutes.

25:36.244 --> 25:38.246
(Train chugging in distance)

25:47.964 --> 25:49.090
(Sighs)

25:50.174 --> 25:51.175
Woman: Mamita.

25:51.843 --> 25:53.594
Didn't you hear me...? (Sighs)

25:53.678 --> 25:56.264
What are you doing? Ay, nena...

25:56.347 --> 25:57.890
Maria: No, no, no, no.

25:57.974 --> 25:58.975
It look like a shroud,

25:59.058 --> 26:00.536
- it's so big and so white.
- (Speaks Spanish)

26:00.560 --> 26:02.687
It wouldn't look like a shroud
if it was red.

26:02.770 --> 26:06.983
(Conversing in Spanish)

26:11.446 --> 26:12.739
Speak English.

26:12.822 --> 26:14.991
In gimbels, there are lots
of dresses that fit me.

26:15.074 --> 26:18.536
And you don't shop in gimbels.
You clean in gimbels.

26:18.619 --> 26:19.954
- Maria: Ay.
- Mm.

26:20.037 --> 26:21.789
Ahorrar tus chavitos,

26:21.873 --> 26:22.999
- fancy pants.
- (Zips dress)

26:23.082 --> 26:24.083
(Maria grunts)

26:25.835 --> 26:27.420
(Maria groans)

26:27.503 --> 26:29.297
Aw. Si.

26:30.339 --> 26:32.091
Ay, turn around.

26:45.897 --> 26:48.524
Hmm. (Praising in Spanish)

26:50.485 --> 26:51.569
(Chuckles)

26:52.904 --> 26:54.614
Ay, Anita.

26:56.157 --> 26:58.785
- (Speaks Spanish)
- (Both chuckle)

26:59.577 --> 27:01.120
- (Exclaims in Spanish)
- Oh!

27:01.204 --> 27:03.080
Ay, don't mess up my hair.

27:03.164 --> 27:04.749
I just got it to act right.

27:04.999 --> 27:06.375
Ugh. Ok.

27:06.459 --> 27:07.585
(Sighs)

27:10.755 --> 27:12.215
Get your shoes on.

27:12.590 --> 27:15.843
Bernardo will be so mad
if we make him late.

27:16.010 --> 27:18.846
And I want to dance.

27:19.263 --> 27:20.306
(Giggles)

27:23.559 --> 27:25.478
Bernardo's always mad.

27:26.187 --> 27:28.105
Necesito lipstick.

27:28.981 --> 27:31.234
I'm too short. I need, please.

27:31.317 --> 27:35.112
Please, some lipstick,
and maybe some eyeliner.

27:35.196 --> 27:36.531
- Hmm.
- The boys think I'm a kid.

27:36.614 --> 27:37.824
You are a kid, kiddo.

27:37.907 --> 27:39.283
I'm 18. I have a job.

27:39.367 --> 27:41.285
I've been taking care of papi
since I was six.

27:41.369 --> 27:42.620
Bernardo thinks I'm a baby.

27:42.703 --> 27:44.831
Who cares what Bernardo thinks?

27:44.914 --> 27:48.042
Chino is the only boy who counts.

27:48.125 --> 27:49.752
Oh, chino. Mi primer baile
en nueva York

27:49.836 --> 27:52.129
and I have to go with
the zangano I don't want to.

27:52.213 --> 27:54.465
Ay, be nice. Chino is a very sweet boy.

27:54.549 --> 27:56.509
- (Speaks Spanish)
- (Anita sighs)

27:56.592 --> 27:58.761
You can't take that personally.

27:58.845 --> 28:00.638
He's got to be like that.

28:00.721 --> 28:03.474
It's how he got to be a great boxer.

28:03.558 --> 28:04.892
Everyone's afraid of him.

28:04.976 --> 28:06.310
Mm, but I'm not.

28:06.394 --> 28:08.187
Man: Anita, we're home.

28:08.271 --> 28:09.564
(Door closes)

28:09.647 --> 28:11.190
(Muffled chatter)

28:14.944 --> 28:16.988
Are you ready? Chino's here.

28:19.782 --> 28:21.284
(Bernardo speaks Spanish)

28:22.994 --> 28:24.328
You gotta dance with her.

28:24.412 --> 28:26.080
(Speaks Spanish)

28:26.163 --> 28:27.540
- I don't know how to dance.
- Ay.

28:28.541 --> 28:31.752
She's bossy. She gonna show you how.

28:31.836 --> 28:34.589
(Speaking Spanish)

28:37.508 --> 28:38.509
Don't move.

28:40.219 --> 28:42.263
You always look out for me.

28:42.346 --> 28:44.223
You're the best friend I ever had.

28:44.307 --> 28:45.784
I owe you so much.
But I just wish that...

28:45.808 --> 28:48.853
You're the smartest friend I ever had.

28:49.478 --> 28:51.078
Maria needs to meet smart guys like you.

28:51.147 --> 28:52.231
Let me join the sharks.

28:52.315 --> 28:53.941
Ay, muchacho, not this again.

28:54.025 --> 28:55.168
Por favor, let me help you
protect our people.

28:55.192 --> 28:56.193
Bernardo: No.

28:56.277 --> 28:58.696
You keep out of that. It's stupid.

28:58.779 --> 29:00.448
We gotta do it, but it's stupid.

29:00.531 --> 29:04.869
Maria can't like a iambeojo
who just works day and night.

29:04.952 --> 29:06.704
Never stands up like her brother does.

29:06.787 --> 29:07.830
She says all the time

29:07.914 --> 29:09.665
she doesn't want anyone like me.

29:10.666 --> 29:12.418
Just be chino.

29:13.419 --> 29:15.212
But be a chino who dances.

29:16.839 --> 29:18.049
(Door opens)

29:21.177 --> 29:23.262
(Conversing in Spanish)

29:24.472 --> 29:25.514
You look like mami.

29:25.598 --> 29:27.683
And, chino, quÃ© guapo.

29:27.767 --> 29:28.927
He took off from night school

29:28.976 --> 29:30.370
just so he could take you to the dance.

29:30.394 --> 29:31.395
Gracias, chino.

29:31.479 --> 29:34.315
Night school, accounting, and...

29:35.441 --> 29:38.444
And, chino, what else
are you learning about?

29:38.527 --> 29:40.112
Adding machine repair.

29:40.196 --> 29:41.447
Anita: And just think,

29:41.530 --> 29:43.658
how many adding machines
in New York City.

29:43.741 --> 29:45.159
Chino is gonna be rich.

29:45.242 --> 29:46.410
Well, not exactly, pero...

29:46.494 --> 29:47.495
Boxers get rich.

29:47.578 --> 29:49.997
Boxers get their brains knocked out.

29:50.414 --> 29:52.375
Bossy, como te dije,

29:52.458 --> 29:54.043
y una wiseass.

29:54.126 --> 29:55.127
(Speaks Spanish)

29:55.211 --> 29:58.297
The gringos tonight,
they stare because...

29:58.381 --> 29:59.441
Anita: Oh, like you don't stare.

29:59.465 --> 30:02.051
Because our girls
make their girls look lousy.

30:02.593 --> 30:04.428
(Speaks Spanish)

30:04.720 --> 30:07.473
The first gringo boy
who smiles at you... pow!

30:07.556 --> 30:10.393
Ay, Mr. Juvenile delincuente.

30:10.476 --> 30:11.662
- Bernardo: Vamos.
- (Anita chuckles)

30:11.686 --> 30:13.062
I told you she likes him.

30:14.146 --> 30:16.148
(Soft, pensive music playing)

30:20.695 --> 30:22.822
(Bernardo and Anita laughing)

30:22.905 --> 30:24.365
Anita: You want her to pick him,

30:24.448 --> 30:26.033
keep telling her she has to like him.

30:37.253 --> 30:38.504
(Maria chuckles)

30:42.466 --> 30:44.301
(Indistinct conversation)

30:44.385 --> 30:46.387

(All cheer)

31:03.195 --> 31:05.406
(Upbeat jazz music continues)

31:26.594 --> 31:27.904
Hey, get away from her, you lesbo!

31:27.928 --> 31:30.056
- Get out of here!
- Hey, hey, what are you doing?

31:30.639 --> 31:32.558
(Speaking Spanish)

31:37.521 --> 31:38.606
(Sniffs)

31:43.986 --> 31:46.197
(Upbeat jazz music continues)

31:55.039 --> 31:56.373
How about you give me some room?

31:56.457 --> 31:58.125
(Speaks Spanish)

32:10.346 --> 32:11.972
(Crowd cheering)

32:24.693 --> 32:26.904

32:39.708 --> 32:41.428

- You wanna dance, buddy?

32:41.502 --> 32:43.504
(All clamouring)

32:45.673 --> 32:47.675
Get back! (Blowing whistle)

32:47.758 --> 32:49.593
Officer: Let's back up! Back up!

32:50.052 --> 32:52.179
(Continues blowing whistle)

32:55.349 --> 32:57.935
Everyone, keep calm now!

32:58.018 --> 33:00.354
Contain the aggression, ok?

33:00.938 --> 33:02.165
What's the matter with you guys?

33:02.189 --> 33:03.649
Pretty girls wanting to dance

33:03.732 --> 33:06.068
and all youse can think of
is to beat up on each other.

33:06.152 --> 33:08.320
- Thank you, officer.
- (Jets laughing)

33:08.404 --> 33:10.197
Alright! Alright!

33:10.281 --> 33:13.909
So, tonight is a social experiment,
boys and girls,

33:13.993 --> 33:16.871
brotherhood and all that,
and you're the Guinea pigs.

33:17.580 --> 33:20.749
(Jets snorting and laughing)

33:21.167 --> 33:23.252
Thank you, right on cue.

33:23.669 --> 33:26.172
Be nice to each other!
Give us some hope!

33:26.255 --> 33:27.339
Just for a little bit,

33:27.423 --> 33:29.633
then you can revert back
to your true feral selves.

33:29.717 --> 33:33.596
Now, boys,
get into a big circle facing in.

33:33.679 --> 33:35.598
And, girls, make a small circle

33:35.681 --> 33:37.224
on the inside, facing out.

33:37.308 --> 33:39.310

- (All arguing)

33:46.734 --> 33:47.776

You don't like dancing?

I like it.

Since I...

40:56.121 --> 40:58.040
I never seen you before.

so, you tell me.

41:04.338 --> 41:05.756

Tony: I didn't mean no disrespect.

42:13.365 --> 42:14.645
I just wanted to dance with her.

42:14.700 --> 42:16.785
She don't wanna dance
with you, American.

42:16.868 --> 42:18.412
Come on, we're all Americans, right?

42:18.495 --> 42:20.330
Keep away from her, hijo de puta!

42:20.414 --> 42:22.058
Hey, hey! Now that

Well, that's against the law.
You ought to report that.

It was embarrassing.

59:50.463 --> 59:51.881
And he's apologising.

59:53.174 --> 59:54.884
Perdon.

59:54.967 --> 59:56.552
I'm a grown-up now, Bernardo.

59:56.635 --> 59:58.012
I can dance with anyone I like.

59:58.095 --> 59:59.889
As long as he's puertorriquefio.

59:59.972 --> 01:00:02.141
But why? Tony's a nice boy.

01:00:02.224 --> 01:00:05.186
Tony? (Speaks Spanish)

01:00:06.187 --> 01:00:08.355
Tony. Who cares if he's a...?

01:00:09.023 --> 01:00:10.733
I don't know what he is. A yankee?

01:00:10.816 --> 01:00:13.444
He's a polack. That's what he is.

01:00:13.527 --> 01:00:16.113
A big, dumb polack.

01:00:16.197 --> 01:00:18.491
"Polack," says the spic.

01:00:18.574 --> 01:00:21.160
Now you sound like a real American.
(Chuckles)

01:00:24.705 --> 01:00:26.540
I don't want you to marry a gringo.

01:00:27.541 --> 01:00:28.959
Marry him?

01:00:29.668 --> 01:00:32.338
I danced with him, Bernardo.

01:00:32.421 --> 01:00:33.714
For a minute, until you...

01:00:34.381 --> 01:00:36.926
You're crazy.
I can't talk to you anymore.

01:00:37.009 --> 01:00:38.344
(Speaks Spanish)

01:00:38.969 --> 01:00:40.638
I was ok on my own.

01:00:40.721 --> 01:00:43.432
Just me and papi
for five years without you,

01:00:43.516 --> 01:00:44.934
while you came here,

01:00:45.017 --> 01:00:46.894
where you do everything you want.

01:00:46.977 --> 01:00:49.772
You... you study, and you make money...

01:00:49.855 --> 01:00:51.106
And he boxes.

01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:52.858
Si. And you have your boxing.

01:00:52.942 --> 01:00:54.902
And he fights in the streets.

01:00:54.985 --> 01:00:56.821
Don't fight with the jets.

01:00:56.904 --> 01:00:58.948
(Speaks Spanish)

01:00:59.031 --> 01:01:00.533
I want you to be happy.

01:01:00.616 --> 01:01:01.951
- (Speaks Spanish)
- Anita: Mm.

01:01:02.034 --> 01:01:04.286
Here, dead man, eat your eggs.

01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:07.164
- And everyone, speak English.
- (Speaks Spanish)

01:01:07.248 --> 01:01:08.582
But I'm here, too.

01:01:08.666 --> 01:01:11.335
And I... I want to make a life, a home.

01:01:11.418 --> 01:01:12.628
Maybe go to city college

01:01:12.711 --> 01:01:15.130
like rosalia's cousin, Virginia.

01:01:15.214 --> 01:01:16.507
I want to be happy here.

01:01:17.132 --> 01:01:18.592
(Speaks Spanish)

01:01:18.676 --> 01:01:19.927
Enghsh.

01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:21.637
Puerto Rico, si.

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:23.514
That is what you think.

01:01:23.597 --> 01:01:26.392
- I'm gonna think for myself.
- You keep away from him.

01:01:27.309 --> 01:01:28.811
(Speaks Spanish, sighs)

01:01:28.894 --> 01:01:30.729
As long as you're in my house...

01:01:30.813 --> 01:01:32.773
This ain't your house.

01:01:32.857 --> 01:01:35.526
She pays rent here
same as me and you.

01:01:35.609 --> 01:01:37.152
This is about family.

01:01:38.153 --> 01:01:39.655
(Speaks Spanish, stops abruptly)

01:01:41.574 --> 01:01:43.742
Ah! (Speaking Spanish)

01:01:45.536 --> 01:01:46.537
(Shouts in Spanish)

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:48.205
(Arguing in Spanish)

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:51.709
- Maria... (Stutters)
- (Anita scoffs)

01:01:51.792 --> 01:01:53.085
(Utensils rattle)

01:01:53.168 --> 01:01:55.045
(Continues speaking Spanish)

01:01:57.631 --> 01:02:00.676
Maybe chino and your friends
fall down at your feet,

01:02:00.759 --> 01:02:02.386
and maybe you scare the americanos

01:02:02.469 --> 01:02:04.471
when you make fists and angry faces...

01:02:05.431 --> 01:02:07.725
(Continues tearfully in Spanish)

01:02:13.856 --> 01:02:16.442
And I am not interested
in what you have to say.

01:02:27.953 --> 01:02:29.371
(Speaks Spanish)

01:02:30.915 --> 01:02:32.416
(Anita breath es deeply)

01:02:33.459 --> 01:02:35.419
You want to know where my home is?

01:02:35.502 --> 01:02:38.172
It's where I pay rent. Right here,

01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:40.758
where I work my fingers raw,

01:02:40.841 --> 01:02:42.927
mending pants and hemming neckties

01:02:43.010 --> 01:02:44.887
so that I can earn enough money

01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:46.764
to pay other girls to sew for me,

01:02:46.847 --> 01:02:50.225
so that someday
I can rent a shop of my own

01:02:50.309 --> 01:02:53.062
in this great, big,
beautiful nueva York.

01:02:55.314 --> 01:02:56.607
(Snaps fingers)

01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:58.776
And if you think

01:02:58.859 --> 01:03:01.403
that I'm going back home
to Puerto Rico with six kids

01:03:01.487 --> 01:03:03.614
that I put to bed hungry every night,

01:03:04.365 --> 01:03:06.951
amor de mi vida, you are dreaming.

01:03:10.663 --> 01:03:12.915
In Puerto Rico, our kids won't get fat

01:03:12.998 --> 01:03:14.208
like the kids in New York.

01:03:14.708 --> 01:03:16.752
(Laughter and indistinct chatter)

01:03:26.303 --> 01:03:28.722
(Low percussion music intro playing)

01:03:37.982 --> 01:03:40.401
(Soft Latin music playing)

01:03:43.612 --> 01:03:46.615
(Singing) Puerto Rico

01:03:46.699 --> 01:03:49.493
you lovely island

01:03:49.576 --> 01:03:54.039
island of tropical breezes

01:03:55.374 --> 01:03:59.712
always the pineapples growing

01:03:59.795 --> 01:04:03.507
always the coffee blossoms blowing

01:04:04.299 --> 01:04:06.635
and the money owing

01:04:07.344 --> 01:04:10.180
and the babies crying

01:04:10.264 --> 01:04:12.683
and the people trying

01:04:12.975 --> 01:04:16.478
I like the island Manhattan

01:04:16.562 --> 01:04:17.646
I know you do!

01:04:17.730 --> 01:04:19.857
Smoke on your pipe

01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:22.484
and put that in

01:04:22.568 --> 01:04:24.403
(music tempo quickens)

01:04:30.325 --> 01:04:32.536
I like to be in america

01:04:32.619 --> 01:04:34.747

01:04:34.830 --> 01:04:37.082

for a small fee in america

01:04:40.335 --> 01:04:41.420
(whistle blows)

01:04:43.797 --> 01:04:46.133
Buying on credit is so nice

01:04:46.216 --> 01:04:48.802
one look at us
and they charge twice

01:04:49.511 --> 01:04:51.680
I have my own washing machine

01:04:51.764 --> 01:04:54.266
what do you have though
to keep clean?

01:04:55.059 --> 01:04:57.394
Skyscrapers bloom in america

01:04:57.478 --> 01:04:59.688
Cadillacs zoom in america

01:05:08.655 --> 01:05:10.783
Lots of new housing with more space

01:05:10.866 --> 01:05:13.410
lots of doors slamming in our face

01:05:14.369 --> 01:05:16.622
I 'ii get a terrace apartment

life can be bright in america

01:05:22.377 --> 01:05:24.463
if you can fight in america

01:05:24.546 --> 01:05:26.799
life is alright in america

01:05:26.882 --> 01:05:29.051

Here you are free

(Repeats Spanish phrase)

01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:57.718
So, who are you so happy to see again?

01:08:59.678 --> 01:09:01.263

Ay, Tony,

01:09:19.531 --> 01:09:20.532
I don't wanna jinx it,

01:09:20.615 --> 01:09:22.492
but maybe I'm done with trouble.

01:09:22.576 --> 01:09:25.871
You are never done with troubles. Nunca.

01:09:26.621 --> 01:09:28.749
- Nunca. "Nunca" means "never"?
- Uh-huh.

01:09:33.587 --> 01:09:35.005
What's "forever"?

01:09:35.839 --> 01:09:39.051
Like, "I wanna be with you forever."

01:09:39.968 --> 01:09:41.386
You don't wanna start, maybe,

01:09:41.470 --> 01:09:43.764
with "I'd like to
take you out to coffee"?

01:09:44.221 --> 01:09:45.890
No. Come on, tell me.

01:09:45.974 --> 01:09:47.684

01:09:47.768 --> 01:09:50.854
"for a cream cheese sandwich
on a raisin bread"?

01:09:51.145 --> 01:09:52.356
This ain't casual like that.

01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:59.279
"I want to be with you forever."

01:09:59.988 --> 01:10:01.990

Tony: I wanna show you something.

01:10:29.476 --> 01:10:31.436
It's a surprise, uptown.

01:10:32.521 --> 01:10:35.649
- You seem sorta...
- There's a fight tonight.

01:10:35.732 --> 01:10:37.901
Between my brother and his friends.

01:10:37.984 --> 01:10:40.070
- News to me.
- And your friend

01:10:40.153 --> 01:10:41.905
who helped you when Bernardo...

01:10:42.489 --> 01:10:43.490
Riff.

01:10:44.699 --> 01:10:47.327
Tell him, riff, tell him not to.

01:10:47.661 --> 01:10:49.871
It's because of us
they're gonna fight, verdad?

01:10:49.955 --> 01:10:52.082
Well, get your brother to call it off.

01:10:52.165 --> 01:10:53.458
Bernardo's too angry.

01:10:54.501 --> 01:10:56.002
Well, riff's angry, too, so...

01:10:56.336 --> 01:10:57.963
- Come on.
- (Train horn toots)

01:11:11.518 --> 01:11:15.272
This place we're going,
it's, uh, up past Harlem.

01:11:16.356 --> 01:11:18.150
It's practically
at the tip of the island.

01:11:18.233 --> 01:11:19.651
My brother...

01:11:20.402 --> 01:11:23.488
There's so much more
against him than riff.

01:11:23.572 --> 01:11:24.698
He's angry because...

01:11:24.781 --> 01:11:26.783
The whole world has been against riff

01:11:26.867 --> 01:11:27.993
since he was born.

01:11:29.786 --> 01:11:32.289
Do you think it's easier for us?

01:11:33.707 --> 01:11:36.877
Uh, well, I think you come
from families, homes.

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:38.336
You and Bernardo, you have hope.

01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:39.838
You think riff has that?

01:11:39.921 --> 01:11:41.858
Riff could have hope
if he didn't try to take hope

01:11:41.882 --> 01:11:43.002
from people he doesn't know.

01:11:43.049 --> 01:11:45.010
Riff didn't start this, it was Bernardo.

01:11:45.093 --> 01:11:46.428
He came after me.

01:11:46.511 --> 01:11:48.054
Just cause I wanted to dance with you.

01:11:48.138 --> 01:11:50.432
Tony, if someone gets hurt
because of what we do...

01:11:50.515 --> 01:11:52.809
What did we do to anyone?

01:11:53.643 --> 01:11:56.396
We don't do anything wrong,
liking each other,

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:57.856
- pero...
- Maria.

01:11:59.399 --> 01:12:01.526
I don't just like you.

01:12:07.282 --> 01:12:10.285
We can't pretend what we do
doesn't cause trouble.

01:12:13.663 --> 01:12:16.249
I can't talk my guys
outta making trouble.

01:12:17.501 --> 01:12:19.503
Trouble's what they're made of.

01:12:36.937 --> 01:12:38.522
All of you go suck a pickle.

01:12:39.231 --> 01:12:40.941
You think we're going to jail?

01:12:41.024 --> 01:12:43.985
They're fishing, is all.
Asking questions.

01:12:44.069 --> 01:12:47.113
Which we ain't answering.

01:12:47.197 --> 01:12:49.115
So, you're gonna tell me

01:12:49.199 --> 01:12:50.951
where and when the rumble's happening...

01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:53.471
Or I'm gonna send you
straight to the tombs.

01:12:53.495 --> 01:12:56.081
I don't know where the rumble is.

01:12:56.498 --> 01:12:58.750
I don't even know what a rumble is.

01:13:01.127 --> 01:13:03.046
Uh, they don't tell me nothing.

01:13:03.129 --> 01:13:04.839
They know I can't keep any secrets.

01:13:04.923 --> 01:13:06.466
They tell you when to show up, right?

01:13:06.550 --> 01:13:08.051
Nah, they don't.

01:13:08.134 --> 01:13:11.513
I just hang around
until somebody says "let's go."

01:13:12.305 --> 01:13:13.431
And then?

01:13:17.769 --> 01:13:19.354
(Faint radio chatter)

01:13:21.022 --> 01:13:22.399
I can't go to jail, deez.

01:13:22.482 --> 01:13:24.818
Dry up, weepy, or else go sit
on the ladies' bench

01:13:24.901 --> 01:13:26.194
with the other dickless wonder.

01:13:26.278 --> 01:13:28.113
- Leave her be.
- Get stuffed, why don't ya?

01:13:28.196 --> 01:13:29.990
Go back to the zoo, why don't ya?

01:13:30.073 --> 01:13:31.717
Go suck on your sister's titty,
why don't ya?

01:13:31.741 --> 01:13:33.076
You Guinea hyena.

01:13:33.618 --> 01:13:35.620
Hey, krupke! You made a mistake.

01:13:35.704 --> 01:13:37.414
She ain't a jet.
She nags us all the time.

01:13:37.497 --> 01:13:38.933
Hey, I ought to be a jet.
Tony told me...

01:13:38.957 --> 01:13:39.958
She ain't a jet.

01:13:40.041 --> 01:13:41.310
- She ain't even a boy.
- Pipe down, a-rab.

01:13:41.334 --> 01:13:42.770
- She's a dumb girl.
- I ain't a girl!

01:13:42.794 --> 01:13:44.796
She looks like some kinda
biological disaster,

01:13:44.879 --> 01:13:47.882
but I pantsed her once,
and under oath, she's a girl!

01:13:47.966 --> 01:13:50.010
I said I ain't no goddamn girl,

01:13:50.093 --> 01:13:52.762
you shrivel-dick dago pansy!

01:13:53.471 --> 01:13:55.724
- (Both grunting)
- Krupke: Get off of him.

01:13:58.685 --> 01:14:00.520
Cut it out! Now!

01:14:02.606 --> 01:14:04.250
You're gonna break her arm,
you godforsaken...

01:14:04.274 --> 01:14:05.775
I'm trying to get her off of him.

01:14:07.819 --> 01:14:09.112
Back up! God!

01:14:09.696 --> 01:14:11.114
My ulcer.

01:14:15.785 --> 01:14:17.287
It's a freaking felony!

01:14:17.370 --> 01:14:19.372
Assaulting an officer of the...

01:14:21.166 --> 01:14:22.167
Sit yourselves some place

01:14:22.250 --> 01:14:24.169
and don't move a muscle till I get back!

01:14:24.252 --> 01:14:26.421
Don't even sweat! Youse hear me?

01:14:31.551 --> 01:14:33.553
Hey, a girl gave me a nosebleed.

01:14:33.637 --> 01:14:35.138
She just bought herself a ticket

01:14:35.221 --> 01:14:36.931
to the house of detention.

01:14:37.682 --> 01:14:38.933
What about us?

01:14:39.017 --> 01:14:41.227
- Rikers, most likely.
- Baby John: Rikers?

01:14:41.311 --> 01:14:43.271
What, you ain't
never been arrested before?

01:14:43.355 --> 01:14:45.398
He ain't never been nothing before.

01:14:46.191 --> 01:14:48.526
- Baby John: That'd kill my ma.
- Oh.

01:14:56.868 --> 01:14:58.203
I can't go to jail.

01:14:58.286 --> 01:15:00.914
You won't.
Long as you remember two things.

01:15:00.997 --> 01:15:02.916
One, tell 'em what they wanna hear.

01:15:02.999 --> 01:15:05.835
And two, don't tell 'em nothing.

01:15:06.378 --> 01:15:07.587
Hey, garbage!

01:15:09.422 --> 01:15:10.423
Who?

01:15:10.507 --> 01:15:13.051
- Me, officer krupke?
- (Boys laugh)

01:15:13.134 --> 01:15:14.177
Well, look at youse.

01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:16.805
You feckless frigging disappointments.

01:15:16.888 --> 01:15:18.223
Now, give me one good reason

01:15:18.306 --> 01:15:20.684
I shouldn't throw the book at ya.

01:15:25.230 --> 01:15:29.025
(Singing)
Dear kindly sergeant krupke

01:15:29.109 --> 01:15:31.152
you gotta understand

01:15:31.236 --> 01:15:32.779
it's just our bringin' upke

01:15:32.862 --> 01:15:34.572
that gets us out of hand

01:15:34.656 --> 01:15:36.282
our mothers all are junkies

01:15:36.366 --> 01:15:38.535
our fathers all are drunks

01:15:39.035 --> 01:15:41.496
golly Moses

01:15:41.579 --> 01:15:43.540
naturally we 're punks

01:15:44.416 --> 01:15:47.669
gee, officer krupke

01:15:47.752 --> 01:15:50.296
we 're very upset

01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:54.426
we never had the love
that every child ought to get

01:15:55.135 --> 01:15:57.387
we ain't no delinquents

01:15:57.470 --> 01:16:00.807
we 're misunderstood

01:16:00.890 --> 01:16:04.477
deep down inside us
there is good

01:16:05.061 --> 01:16:06.813
there is good

01:16:06.896 --> 01:16:08.332
-there is good
-(Upbeat music playing)

01:16:08.356 --> 01:16:09.357
There is good

01:16:09.441 --> 01:16:12.527
there is untapped good
like inside

01:16:12.610 --> 01:16:14.070
the worst of us is good

01:16:14.154 --> 01:16:16.030
aw, that's a touching good story.

01:16:16.114 --> 01:16:17.574
Let me tell it to the world!

01:16:17.657 --> 01:16:19.576
Oh, just tell it to the judge.

01:16:20.827 --> 01:16:22.495
(All exclaim)

01:16:22.579 --> 01:16:23.663
Whoo!

01:16:23.747 --> 01:16:26.207
- (Upbeat music continues)
- (Indistinct talking)

01:16:28.126 --> 01:16:29.377
Get over there.

01:16:29.586 --> 01:16:31.921
Dear kindly judge, your honour

01:16:32.005 --> 01:16:35.216
my parents treat me rough
with all their marijuana

01:16:35.300 --> 01:16:36.885
they won't give me a puff

01:16:36.968 --> 01:16:40.430
they didn't wanna have me
but somehow I was had

01:16:40.513 --> 01:16:43.475
leapin' lizards
that's why I'm so bad

01:16:43.558 --> 01:16:47.061
right! Officer krupke
you're really a square

01:16:47.145 --> 01:16:50.398
this boy don't need a judge
he needs a analyst's care

01:16:50.482 --> 01:16:53.943
it's just his neurosis
that ought to be curbed

01:16:54.027 --> 01:16:55.904
he's psychologically disturbed

01:16:55.987 --> 01:16:56.988
I'm disturbed!

01:16:57.071 --> 01:16:58.615
We 're disturbed
we 're disturbed

01:16:58.698 --> 01:17:00.241
we 're the most disturbed

01:17:00.325 --> 01:17:02.952
like we 're psychologically disturbed

01:17:03.036 --> 01:17:04.496
(all laugh and scream)

01:17:04.579 --> 01:17:06.748
(Upbeat music continues)

01:17:06.831 --> 01:17:08.082
(Whooping)

01:17:11.628 --> 01:17:13.296
Balkan: Hear ye, hear ye.

01:17:13.379 --> 01:17:15.232
In the opinion of this court,
the boy's depraved

01:17:15.256 --> 01:17:16.883
on account of he ain't had
a normal home.

01:17:16.966 --> 01:17:18.843
Hey, I'm depraved
on account of I'm deprived!

01:17:18.927 --> 01:17:20.367
So, take this nut to a headshrinker.

01:17:20.428 --> 01:17:21.721
Oh, why not? Come on.

01:17:21.805 --> 01:17:23.556
Diesel: Go, go, go.

01:17:26.810 --> 01:17:30.688
My father is a bastard
my ma's an s. 0.8.

01:17:30.772 --> 01:17:34.025
My grandpa's always plastered
my grandma pushes tea

01:17:34.108 --> 01:17:37.987
my sister wears a moustache
my brother wears a dress

01:17:38.071 --> 01:17:39.364
goodness gracious

01:17:39.447 --> 01:17:41.157
-that's why I'm a mess -yes!

01:17:41.241 --> 01:17:44.077
Officer krupke
you're really a slob

01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:47.372
this boy don't need a doctor
just a good honest job

01:17:47.455 --> 01:17:51.084
society's played him a terrible trick

01:17:51.167 --> 01:17:53.127
and sociologically he's sick

01:17:53.211 --> 01:17:55.797
- I am sick!
- We are sick, we are sick

01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:57.382
we are sick, sick, sick

01:17:57.465 --> 01:17:59.759
like we 're sociologically sick

01:18:00.218 --> 01:18:01.219
(whooping)

01:18:01.302 --> 01:18:03.388
A-rab: I did it! Yeah!

01:18:03.847 --> 01:18:06.087
Diesel: Officer, I'm guilty.
Mouthpiece: Get out of here.

01:18:08.434 --> 01:18:10.603
In my professional opinion,

01:18:10.687 --> 01:18:11.688
what we got here

01:18:11.771 --> 01:18:14.023
is a run-ofâ€”the-mill
juvenile delinquent,

01:18:14.107 --> 01:18:17.277
and juvenile delinquency
is a social disease.

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:18.945
Ew, diesel, you got a social disease?

01:18:19.028 --> 01:18:20.613
Bring him to a social worker.

01:18:20.697 --> 01:18:22.782
Wait, can I catch it by touching him?

01:18:25.285 --> 01:18:26.286
Get down.

01:18:26.369 --> 01:18:27.954
Big deal: Oh! (Laughs)

01:18:28.037 --> 01:18:29.664
Dear

01:18:29.747 --> 01:18:31.249
kindly social worker

01:18:31.332 --> 01:18:32.750
-they say go earn a buck
-(Laughter)

01:18:32.834 --> 01:18:34.502
Like be a soda jerker

01:18:34.586 --> 01:18:36.212
which means like be a schmuck

01:18:36.296 --> 01:18:39.757
it's not I'm antisocial
I'm only anti-work

01:18:39.841 --> 01:18:41.342
glory! Osky!

01:18:41.426 --> 01:18:42.760
That's why I'm a jerk

01:18:42.844 --> 01:18:44.637
(in falsetto)
Yee! Officer krupke

01:18:44.721 --> 01:18:46.306
you've done it again

01:18:46.389 --> 01:18:48.892
this boy don't need a job
he needs a year in the pen

01:18:50.101 --> 01:18:53.229
it ain't just a question
of misunderstood

01:18:53.313 --> 01:18:55.315
deep down inside him
he's no good

01:18:55.398 --> 01:18:57.901
-I'm no good
-we're no good, we're no good

01:18:57.984 --> 01:18:59.527
we're no earthly good

01:18:59.611 --> 01:19:02.155
like the best of us is no damn good

01:19:04.699 --> 01:19:06.284
the trouble is he's crazy

01:19:06.367 --> 01:19:07.702
the trouble is he drinks

01:19:07.785 --> 01:19:09.287
the trouble is he's lazy

01:19:09.370 --> 01:19:10.830
the trouble is he stinks

01:19:10.914 --> 01:19:12.373
the trouble is he's growin'

01:19:12.457 --> 01:19:14.334
the trouble is he's grown

01:19:14.417 --> 01:19:17.879
krupke, we've got troubles of our own

01:19:17.962 --> 01:19:22.258
gee, officer krupke
we're down on our knees

01:19:22.342 --> 01:19:26.304
cause no one wants a fellow
with a social disease

01:19:26.387 --> 01:19:32.644
gee, officer krupke
what are we to do?

01:19:32.727 --> 01:19:34.854
Gee, officer krupke

01:19:35.188 --> 01:19:36.522
krup you

01:19:36.606 --> 01:19:37.607
(music ends)

01:19:37.690 --> 01:19:39.692
(Panting heavily)

01:19:40.818 --> 01:19:43.154
(All panting heavily)

01:19:55.083 --> 01:19:56.459
This is for you.

01:20:04.050 --> 01:20:05.510
Tony: This is the surprise.

01:20:05.593 --> 01:20:07.470
Maria: It look like a church.

01:20:08.388 --> 01:20:10.431
Tony: It's a museum now, you know.

01:20:24.195 --> 01:20:26.364
First time I saw this place,

01:20:27.323 --> 01:20:29.117
I was on a prison bus.

01:20:30.410 --> 01:20:32.829
Up to the state prison in ossining.

01:20:38.918 --> 01:20:40.628
There was a rumble.

01:20:42.755 --> 01:20:44.716
And I busted up this kid.

01:20:46.175 --> 01:20:48.219
He was in the Egyptian kings.

01:20:51.139 --> 01:20:53.433
He only didn't die because of luck,

01:20:53.516 --> 01:20:57.854
like, one more punch
and he probably would've died.

01:20:57.937 --> 01:20:59.564
And I would've done it.

01:21:00.314 --> 01:21:01.792
I would've murdered this messed-up kid

01:21:01.816 --> 01:21:03.776
who wasn't no different from me.

01:21:04.902 --> 01:21:06.630
And for a year in prison
and since I got out,

01:21:06.654 --> 01:21:08.740
I can't quit thinking about
what I almost done.

01:21:09.657 --> 01:21:11.492
I think about killing him, and...

01:21:11.576 --> 01:21:13.387
And it's like I'm always
just about to fall off

01:21:13.411 --> 01:21:16.039
the edge of
the world's tallest building.

01:21:18.207 --> 01:21:20.960
I stopped failing the second I saw you.

01:21:23.588 --> 01:21:25.590
(Church bell tolling)

01:21:45.401 --> 01:21:48.279
I shouldn't have asked you
to stop the fighting.

01:21:50.406 --> 01:21:53.326
I don't want you to go
anywhere near the fighting.

01:22:12.345 --> 01:22:14.555
(Slowly recites phrase in Spanish)

01:22:22.105 --> 01:22:23.648
(Laughs)

01:22:23.731 --> 01:22:25.775
Don't laugh. It means I wanna be...

01:22:25.858 --> 01:22:27.985
I know what it means.

01:22:49.507 --> 01:22:51.509
(Speaking Spanish)

01:22:54.929 --> 01:22:56.139
I don't know what that...

01:22:56.597 --> 01:22:58.850
(Soft music playing)

01:23:02.812 --> 01:23:04.814
- (Laughs) Oh, that's...
- Don't laugh.

01:23:07.191 --> 01:23:08.276
(Gulps)

01:23:09.610 --> 01:23:12.155
I, Tony...

01:23:12.488 --> 01:23:15.324
I, Anton,

01:23:16.075 --> 01:23:18.828
take you, Maria,

01:23:20.371 --> 01:23:22.498
- rich or poor...
- I'm poor.

01:23:22.582 --> 01:23:23.875
I'm poorer.

01:23:25.418 --> 01:23:27.628
(Continues vow in Spanish)

01:23:34.343 --> 01:23:37.847
To love you and respect you.

01:23:40.474 --> 01:23:41.684
Siempre.

01:23:42.894 --> 01:23:45.104
(Soft music continues)

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:50.359
Tony: (Singing)
Make of our hands

01:23:50.443 --> 01:23:53.988
one hand

01:23:54.071 --> 01:23:57.825
make of our hearts

01:23:57.909 --> 01:24:01.078
one heart

01:24:01.579 --> 01:24:05.041
make of our vows

01:24:05.124 --> 01:24:08.711
one last vow

01:24:09.212 --> 01:24:12.298
even death

01:24:12.381 --> 01:24:17.345
won't part us now

01:24:17.428 --> 01:24:21.098
make of our lives

01:24:21.182 --> 01:24:24.477
one life

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:28.147
day after day

01:24:28.231 --> 01:24:31.984
one life

01:24:32.068 --> 01:24:35.613
now it begins

01:24:35.696 --> 01:24:39.450
now we start

01:24:39.533 --> 01:24:42.912
one hand

01:24:43.746 --> 01:24:47.959
one heart

01:24:48.042 --> 01:24:51.462
only death

01:24:51.545 --> 01:24:58.386
will part us now

01:24:58.469 --> 01:25:00.680
(soft music continues)

01:25:10.690 --> 01:25:14.777
You're worried.
But they're still my guys.

01:25:15.278 --> 01:25:17.613
- They'll listen to me.
- But what if you can't?

01:25:17.697 --> 01:25:18.739
We can't be together

01:25:18.823 --> 01:25:20.908
while they're brawling all around us.

01:25:20.992 --> 01:25:22.285
Because of us.

01:25:23.995 --> 01:25:25.997
I swear to you, Maria,

01:25:27.498 --> 01:25:29.500
there won't be any fight.

01:25:31.961 --> 01:25:35.881
(Singing) Make of our lives

01:25:35.965 --> 01:25:39.510
one life

01:25:39.593 --> 01:25:43.055
day after day

01:25:43.139 --> 01:25:46.684
one life

01:25:47.101 --> 01:25:50.730
now it begins

01:25:50.813 --> 01:25:54.483
now we start

01:25:54.567 --> 01:25:58.070
one hand

01:25:58.863 --> 01:26:03.200
one heart

01:26:03.284 --> 01:26:10.249
-Maria: Death won't part
-even death won't part

01:26:10.333 --> 01:26:17.173
-Maria: Us now -us now

01:26:22.928 --> 01:26:25.139
(Soft music continues)

01:26:29.935 --> 01:26:31.645
Come see me tonight.

01:26:42.323 --> 01:26:44.241
Man: You ever fired a gun before?

01:26:44.325 --> 01:26:45.701
Sure, of course I have.

01:26:45.785 --> 01:26:46.994
What kind?

01:26:47.078 --> 01:26:49.121
Colt. Revolver.

01:26:49.205 --> 01:26:51.749
That so? What'd it shoot?

01:26:51.832 --> 01:26:53.209
Bullets.

01:26:53.626 --> 01:26:56.504
- .32s.
- Colt shoots .22s.

01:26:59.256 --> 01:27:00.257
We got money.

01:27:00.341 --> 01:27:02.802
I don't sell heaters to unscrubbed boys.

01:27:04.887 --> 01:27:08.474
These guys,
the ones we're rumbling with,

01:27:09.100 --> 01:27:10.142
they're bringing heat.

01:27:10.226 --> 01:27:11.495
Cause they think we're bringing heat.

01:27:11.519 --> 01:27:12.561
So, we need to bring heat

01:27:12.645 --> 01:27:15.106
so they know that we ain't defenceless.

01:27:15.189 --> 01:27:16.816
And vice versa.

01:27:18.275 --> 01:27:20.569
Mutually assured destruction.

01:27:21.529 --> 01:27:23.280
I don't know what that is.

01:27:25.616 --> 01:27:29.870
That's a Smith and Wesson, model 10.

01:27:31.539 --> 01:27:33.749
Classic of its kind.

01:27:35.835 --> 01:27:39.338
If you want it, take it, why don't ya?

01:27:46.971 --> 01:27:48.722
Fires Trey eights.

01:27:50.307 --> 01:27:53.310
Makes quite a hole for a little gun.

01:27:54.437 --> 01:27:56.021
It's loaded.

01:27:56.105 --> 01:27:57.815
You don't gotta cock it, even.

01:27:58.691 --> 01:28:00.734
You just squeeze the trigger and...

01:28:04.738 --> 01:28:06.323
You might as well.

01:28:09.577 --> 01:28:10.661
(Scoffs)

01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:13.706
You remind me of your dad.

01:28:18.961 --> 01:28:20.337
Leave it on the bar.

01:28:20.838 --> 01:28:22.631
- Riff: (Shouts) What you got?
- (Whooping)

01:28:22.715 --> 01:28:24.341
Jets: Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:28:24.425 --> 01:28:26.635
Riff: Pow, pow, pow!
Action: Pow, pow, pow!

01:28:26.719 --> 01:28:28.596
- Eat lead!
- Riff: Pow, pow, pow!

01:28:29.597 --> 01:28:31.517
Tiger: Come on, you chicken!
Riff: Pow, pow, pow!

01:28:31.599 --> 01:28:33.225
Tiger: Chicken, chicken, chicken!

01:28:34.101 --> 01:28:35.186
Riff: Pow! Pow, pow!

01:28:35.269 --> 01:28:36.979
Tiger: You yellow flatfoot, come on!

01:28:37.062 --> 01:28:38.189
Riff: Pow!

01:28:38.731 --> 01:28:40.274
Pow! Pow, pow!

01:28:40.357 --> 01:28:41.484
Tony: Pow.

01:28:42.485 --> 01:28:43.777
Gee whillikers, Batman.

01:28:43.861 --> 01:28:45.404
Since when you carry a rod?

01:28:45.488 --> 01:28:47.740
Well, I don't got magic powers
like you, Superman,

01:28:47.823 --> 01:28:48.991
so I got this.

01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:53.537
Promise to be with us tonight,
I'll let you hold it.

01:28:54.371 --> 01:28:55.451
When are you gonna grow up?

01:28:55.498 --> 01:28:57.583
Never probably.
Born to die young, daddy-o.

01:28:57.666 --> 01:28:59.126
They catch you with this,

01:28:59.210 --> 01:29:01.003
- it's 15 years in attica.
- (Chuckles)

01:29:01.086 --> 01:29:02.880
- Call it off.
- Call what off?

01:29:02.963 --> 01:29:05.424
Tell Bernardo the cops
found out about the rumble.

01:29:05.508 --> 01:29:06.550
Tell him a rain check.

01:29:06.634 --> 01:29:08.153
Hey, why should we call it off?
We got a gun.

01:29:08.177 --> 01:29:09.637
Shut up, tiger. Stay out of this.

01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:11.781
You know we wouldn't even need
a gun if you was with us?

01:29:11.805 --> 01:29:13.325
But you ain't, so let go
of my goddamn gun.

01:29:13.349 --> 01:29:14.350
I paid for it.

01:29:14.433 --> 01:29:15.535
Tony: You paid for it?
Riff: Right.

01:29:15.559 --> 01:29:16.620
Tony: Oh, ok, well, in that case,

01:29:16.644 --> 01:29:17.964
- oopsy-Daisy.
- Riff: Tony. Tony.

01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:20.314
Tony! Tony!

01:29:21.232 --> 01:29:22.733
Tony! Give me the gun!

01:29:22.816 --> 01:29:24.610
- Call off the rumble.
- Come on, it's mine.

01:29:24.693 --> 01:29:25.694
It's yours?

01:29:26.237 --> 01:29:29.406
Fellas, does it look to you
like this is his gun?

01:29:29.490 --> 01:29:30.824
(Soft jazz music intro playing)

01:29:30.908 --> 01:29:33.327
Alright, let's get some beer
and some weed

01:29:33.410 --> 01:29:34.578
and let's go to the zoo.

01:29:35.204 --> 01:29:36.914
Like the old days, huh?

01:29:36.997 --> 01:29:39.750
Yeah. I will if you will.

01:29:40.459 --> 01:29:42.419
You know me, brother. I don't look back.

01:29:42.962 --> 01:29:44.439
Why? You afraid
of what you're gonna see?

01:29:44.463 --> 01:29:45.464
No, I look ahead.

01:29:45.548 --> 01:29:47.388
I wanna be prepared
in case they come prepared.

01:29:47.466 --> 01:29:49.885
So, give me the gun, Tony.
I mean it. Now.

01:29:49.969 --> 01:29:53.055
(Singing) Boy, boy, crazy boy

01:29:53.138 --> 01:29:55.474
get cool, boy

01:29:55.558 --> 01:29:58.727
got a rocket in your pocket

01:29:58.811 --> 01:30:01.605
-keep coolly cool, boy -come on.

01:30:01.689 --> 01:30:02.773
Don't get hot

01:30:02.856 --> 01:30:06.986
cause, man, you've got
some high times ahead

01:30:07.069 --> 01:30:10.322
take it slow and daddy-o
you can live it up

01:30:10.406 --> 01:30:12.783
-and die in bed -cut the crap!

01:30:12.866 --> 01:30:15.828
Boy, boy, crazy boy

01:30:15.911 --> 01:30:18.497
stay loose, boy

01:30:18.581 --> 01:30:21.625
breeze it, buzz it easy does it

01:30:21.709 --> 01:30:24.420
turn off the juice, boy

01:30:24.503 --> 01:30:25.546
go, man, go

01:30:25.629 --> 01:30:29.049
but not like a yo-yo school boy

01:30:29.133 --> 01:30:31.969
-just play it cool, boy
-(Gun clacks)

01:30:32.052 --> 01:30:36.432
Real cool

01:30:44.898 --> 01:30:46.025
Careful, buddy.

01:30:49.903 --> 01:30:51.905
(Jazz music continues)

01:30:57.536 --> 01:31:00.581
Careful yourself, Superman. Come on.

01:31:13.010 --> 01:31:15.220
(Jazz music continues)

01:31:56.470 --> 01:31:58.764
(Jazz music continues)

01:32:13.821 --> 01:32:15.781
- Cool!
- Tiger: Go!

01:32:16.365 --> 01:32:17.825
- Crazy!
- Cool!

01:32:17.908 --> 01:32:19.076
-Goi -crazy!

01:32:19.159 --> 01:32:20.160
Jets: Go!

Tiger: Come on! Action: Tony!

01:32:32.464 --> 01:32:33.465
I'm open!

01:32:34.258 --> 01:32:35.551
Action: Tiger, toss it!

01:32:36.301 --> 01:32:37.553
Come on, let's go!

01:32:42.266 --> 01:32:44.685
(Jazz music continues)

01:32:56.989 --> 01:32:59.867
(Singing) Boy, boy, crazy boy

01:32:59.950 --> 01:33:02.536

01:33:08.417 --> 01:33:10.502
(jazz music continues)

01:33:13.213 --> 01:33:15.507
Just play it cool, boy

Pow.

01:33:36.779 --> 01:33:37.780
- (Music ends)
- (Panting)

01:33:39.072 --> 01:33:41.033
Sch ran k: It's happening tonight.

01:33:41.575 --> 01:33:43.368
That's all we know.

01:33:43.452 --> 01:33:46.830
The morning papers filled
with stories about dead kids.

01:33:47.706 --> 01:33:49.666
Not on my watch.

01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:51.710
Every block of Lincoln square,

01:33:51.794 --> 01:33:54.755
every inch of San Juan hill.

01:33:57.132 --> 01:33:58.675
I want the West Side locked down.

01:33:59.843 --> 01:34:02.262
- (Up-tempo jazz music playing)
- (Indistinct chatter)

01:34:05.516 --> 01:34:10.062
(Singing) The jets are gonna
have their day tonight

01:34:10.145 --> 01:34:14.441
the jets are gonna
have their way tonight

01:34:14.525 --> 01:34:17.152
the Puerto Ricans grumble
"fair fight"

01:34:17.236 --> 01:34:20.823
but when they start a rumble
we'll rumble 'em right

01:34:21.698 --> 01:34:26.119
we 're gonna hand 'em a surprise tonight

01:34:26.203 --> 01:34:30.874
we 're gonna cut 'em down to size tonight

01:34:30.958 --> 01:34:33.418
we said, "ok, no rumpus
no tricks"

01:34:33.502 --> 01:34:37.422
but just in case they jump us
we 're ready to mix

01:34:37.506 --> 01:34:38.507

01:34:39.633 --> 01:34:41.176
We 're gonna rock it tonight

01:34:41.260 --> 01:34:45.347
we 're gonna jazz it up
and have us a ball

01:34:45.722 --> 01:34:47.224
they're gonna get it tonight

01:34:47.307 --> 01:34:51.645
the more they turn it on
the harder they'll fall

01:34:51.728 --> 01:34:53.021
well, they began it

01:34:53.105 --> 01:34:54.189
well, they began it

01:34:54.273 --> 01:34:57.568
and we 're the ones to stop 'em
once and for all

01:34:57.651 --> 01:34:58.652
tonight!

01:35:05.909 --> 01:35:10.455
-Anita's gonna get her kicks tonight
-ssh!

01:35:10.539 --> 01:35:14.835
We 'ii have
our private little mix tonight

01:35:14.918 --> 01:35:17.754
he'll walk in hot and tired
so what?

01:35:17.838 --> 01:35:20.757
Don't matter if he's tired
as long as he's hot

01:35:21.550 --> 01:35:22.551
- shh!
- Tonight

01:35:22.634 --> 01:35:24.428
Tony: Tonight, tonight

01:35:24.511 --> 01:35:27.931
won't be just any night

01:35:28.015 --> 01:35:33.437
tonight there will be no morning star

01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:37.024
tonight, tonight

01:35:37.107 --> 01:35:39.693
I'll see my love tonight

01:35:39.776 --> 01:35:45.157
and for us
stars will stop where they are

01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:50.704
today
the minutes seem like hours

01:35:50.787 --> 01:35:53.749
the hours go so slowly

01:35:53.832 --> 01:35:58.170
and still the sky is light

01:35:58.253 --> 01:36:01.214
Tony and Maria:
Oh, moon, grow bright

01:36:01.298 --> 01:36:03.967
and make this endless day

01:36:04.051 --> 01:36:07.888
endless night

01:36:07.971 --> 01:36:09.765
(tyres screech)

01:36:09.848 --> 01:36:12.059
(Up-tempo jazz music continues)

01:36:16.104 --> 01:36:19.441
The jets are comin' out on top tonight

01:36:19.524 --> 01:36:20.525
(jets cheer)

01:36:20.609 --> 01:36:23.946
We 're gonna watch Bernardo drop tonight

01:36:24.029 --> 01:36:25.030
(all cheer)

01:36:25.113 --> 01:36:27.824
That puerto rican punk'll go down

01:36:27.908 --> 01:36:31.286
and when he's hollered uncle
we 'ii tear up the town

01:36:31.370 --> 01:36:32.371
tonight, tonight

01:36:32.454 --> 01:36:33.556
ice: We'll be in back of you, boy

01:36:33.580 --> 01:36:35.415
riff: Right
Maria: Won't be just any night

01:36:35.499 --> 01:36:36.667
we 're gonna flatten him good

01:36:36.750 --> 01:36:37.751
right

01:36:37.834 --> 01:36:39.127
womb to tomb?

01:36:39.211 --> 01:36:41.088
Sperm to worm!

01:36:41.171 --> 01:36:43.715
Riff: And then we'll have us
a ball tonight

01:36:43.799 --> 01:36:46.134
-Maria: Tonight, tonight
-we're gonna rock it tonight

01:36:46.218 --> 01:36:48.929
-I'll see my love tonight
-we're gonna jazz it tonight

01:36:49.012 --> 01:36:52.766
and for us
stars will stop where they are

01:36:52.849 --> 01:36:55.227
we 're gonna mix it tonight

01:36:55.310 --> 01:36:59.106
Tony and Maria: Today
the minutes seem like hours

01:36:59.189 --> 01:37:02.109
-j ets: They began it
-Tony: The hours go so slowly

01:37:02.192 --> 01:37:05.320
-sharks: They began it

01:37:05.404 --> 01:37:06.947

01:37:07.030 --> 01:37:08.341
sharks: We'll stop 'em
once and for all

01:37:08.365 --> 01:37:10.742
Maria and Tony:
Oh, moon, grow bright

01:37:10.826 --> 01:37:14.371
and make this endless day
endless night

01:37:14.454 --> 01:37:16.623
sharks:
We 're gonna rock it tonight

01:37:16.707 --> 01:37:23.630
all: Tonight

01:37:23.714 --> 01:37:24.798
(music ends)

01:37:27.009 --> 01:37:28.802
(Shutter whirring)

01:37:38.937 --> 01:37:40.647
(Chains rattling)

01:38:05.797 --> 01:38:07.632
Ice: Welcome to the north pole.

01:38:09.384 --> 01:38:10.594
It's salt.

01:38:10.927 --> 01:38:12.721
For when the streets ice up.

01:38:13.847 --> 01:38:15.057
(Speaks Spanish)

01:38:16.349 --> 01:38:17.726
Kill the lights.

01:38:21.313 --> 01:38:22.481
(Switch clangs)

01:38:25.108 --> 01:38:26.610
(Shutter whirring)

01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:52.969
(Grunts)

01:39:08.276 --> 01:39:09.402
(Grunts)

01:39:14.366 --> 01:39:16.576
Bernardo: Promised your buddy
was gonna be here.

01:39:16.952 --> 01:39:18.995
If you don't keep your word, jefe,

01:39:19.079 --> 01:39:20.122
how am I going to believe

01:39:20.205 --> 01:39:22.374
you'll keep out
of our territory after...

01:39:26.128 --> 01:39:29.673
(Conversing in Spanish)

01:39:35.846 --> 01:39:38.181
And just when all hope is lost...

01:39:44.604 --> 01:39:46.648
So, is this the shot heard
round the world,

01:39:46.731 --> 01:39:48.608
or just, you know,
more of your bullshit?

01:39:48.692 --> 01:39:49.836
Don't ask me about shooting, pal.

01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:50.980
You're the one with the gun.

01:39:51.027 --> 01:39:53.446
That's right, and who are you?
Friend or foe?

01:39:54.906 --> 01:39:56.449
- You're out of control.
- Hey.

01:39:57.409 --> 01:39:59.286
I don't need it if you stand with us.

01:39:59.369 --> 01:40:00.954
Here, take it.

01:40:02.664 --> 01:40:04.166
Go on, it'll be safe with you.

01:40:04.749 --> 01:40:05.917
And you pitch in.

01:40:06.459 --> 01:40:07.544
I wanna talk to...

01:40:07.627 --> 01:40:08.879
I'm doing the talking now.

01:40:09.296 --> 01:40:11.339
- Let's do it!
- All: Yeah!

01:40:12.174 --> 01:40:14.176
- Right now!
- (Indistinct shouting)

01:40:17.387 --> 01:40:18.823
- Can I talk to you?
- Anything you need to say,

01:40:18.847 --> 01:40:20.724
- you can say through me.
- We talked enough.

01:40:20.807 --> 01:40:22.350
Let's try something else.

01:40:22.851 --> 01:40:24.436
You and me,

01:40:24.519 --> 01:40:26.771
we just got off on the wrong foot,
is all.

01:40:26.855 --> 01:40:29.065
I always know which foot I'm on.

01:40:29.149 --> 01:40:30.650
(Huffs) (Sharkslaugh)

01:40:31.610 --> 01:40:33.403
We all know you can fight, Bernardo.

01:40:33.486 --> 01:40:35.655
So, can you just quit dancing
for a second...

01:40:35.739 --> 01:40:37.049
Riff: Yeah, can you quit
whispering in his ear?

01:40:37.073 --> 01:40:39.117
And listen to what
I came here to tell you?

01:40:41.494 --> 01:40:43.330
I got nothing against you.

01:40:43.997 --> 01:40:46.333
And... and if I, somehow or other,

01:40:46.416 --> 01:40:48.043
if I offended you,

01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:50.545
I apologise.

01:40:51.504 --> 01:40:53.423
Oye, pana, I thought
we were going to fight.

01:40:53.506 --> 01:40:55.091
(Clamouring)

01:40:55.175 --> 01:40:56.551
Did you bring him flowers, too?

01:40:56.635 --> 01:40:58.803
Come on, quit flirting with him!
Close his eyes!

01:40:58.887 --> 01:40:59.989
Hey, can't you shut up
for a single goddamn second?

01:41:00.013 --> 01:41:01.574
What are you afraid of?
Your parole officer?

01:41:01.598 --> 01:41:03.391
You are breaking my heart
with this shit!

01:41:03.475 --> 01:41:05.602
- Come on!
- Bernardo: A convict?

01:41:07.562 --> 01:41:09.522
How long in prison?

01:41:09.856 --> 01:41:11.733
Uh, a year.

01:41:11.816 --> 01:41:15.612
In prison, there were
Puerto Ricans, Dominicans?

01:41:15.695 --> 01:41:19.157
Tony: Sure. Puerto Ricans,
Dominicans, Cubans.

01:41:19.241 --> 01:41:21.868
They love locking up
us brown guys.

01:41:21.952 --> 01:41:22.953
(Sharks murmur)

01:41:23.036 --> 01:41:26.081
Tony: This is not about skin.
It's... it's about...

01:41:26.164 --> 01:41:27.516
- It's about territory!
- (Clamouring)

01:41:27.540 --> 01:41:29.292
A-rab: That's right! Our territory!

01:41:29.376 --> 01:41:33.129
None of us would be here
if any of us believed

01:41:33.213 --> 01:41:35.257
we had any place else to be.

01:41:36.299 --> 01:41:38.301
What did you do to get
yourself locked up, primo?

01:41:38.385 --> 01:41:40.154
He beat the snot outta someone
exactly like you!

01:41:40.178 --> 01:41:41.972
It don't matter what I did.

01:41:42.681 --> 01:41:45.642
I'm different now. And...

01:41:47.018 --> 01:41:49.854
You don't gotta worry about me
being with Maria.

01:41:52.565 --> 01:41:54.567
So, you told god and Jesus

01:41:54.651 --> 01:41:57.279
when you get out,
you gonna become somebody new?

01:41:58.363 --> 01:42:00.365
Am I right, pendejito?

01:42:03.034 --> 01:42:05.537
And then you came to that dance

01:42:05.620 --> 01:42:07.998
and you see my sister,

01:42:08.832 --> 01:42:10.250
and you think...

01:42:10.709 --> 01:42:11.710
(All exclaim)

01:42:11.793 --> 01:42:14.879
"How about I get myself a brown girl?"

01:42:15.422 --> 01:42:17.674
(Indistinct shouting)

01:42:17.757 --> 01:42:20.427
"I never spent time
with a little puertorriquefia before."

01:42:20.885 --> 01:42:22.804
- Riff: Tony!
- (Indistinct shouting)

01:42:22.887 --> 01:42:25.890
"If I can be
with a coloured girl like her,

01:42:25.974 --> 01:42:28.059
"I'll be somebody better than I was.

01:42:28.143 --> 01:42:31.021
"Somebody I never been before."

01:42:32.147 --> 01:42:33.958
Diesel: Put your hands up!
Baby John: Come on! Hit him!

01:42:33.982 --> 01:42:35.108
A-rab: Come on!

01:42:35.734 --> 01:42:37.027
(Speaking Spanish)

01:42:38.653 --> 01:42:40.989
He won't fight you,
fight someone who will.

01:42:45.952 --> 01:42:47.704
I love her, Bernardo.

01:42:49.539 --> 01:42:51.791
(Dramatic music playing)

01:42:54.919 --> 01:42:56.212
Stay out of this!

01:42:59.090 --> 01:43:00.717
(Cheering)

01:43:07.807 --> 01:43:09.267
(Cheering continues)

01:43:16.649 --> 01:43:18.651
(Shouting in Spanish)

01:43:23.740 --> 01:43:25.283
(Others continue cheering)

01:43:27.452 --> 01:43:29.371

- (Jets cheering)

01:43:36.461 --> 01:43:37.670
(Stifled breathing)

01:43:38.380 --> 01:43:39.964
- (Clamouring)
- Finish it!

01:43:40.048 --> 01:43:41.400
A-rab: Tony!
What the hell are you doing?

01:43:41.424 --> 01:43:42.425
Diesel: Tony.

01:43:42.509 --> 01:43:44.052
Come on. (Panting)

01:43:55.647 --> 01:43:56.815
(Shouts in Spanish)

01:43:56.898 --> 01:43:58.733
(Clamouring)

01:44:00.318 --> 01:44:01.569
Fight me!

01:44:05.490 --> 01:44:06.491
Riff...

01:44:08.701 --> 01:44:10.912
(Suspenseful music playing)

01:44:33.184 --> 01:44:35.228
(Dramatic music playing)

01:44:42.110 --> 01:44:43.194
(Grunts)

01:44:51.703 --> 01:44:52.704
(Grunts)

01:44:53.413 --> 01:44:55.081
- Ok. That's enough.
- Tony! Tony! Tony!

01:44:55.165 --> 01:44:56.624
Let go! Let go!

01:45:01.796 --> 01:45:03.506
(Panting)

01:45:10.597 --> 01:45:11.681
(Chuckles)

01:45:18.646 --> 01:45:20.899
It's ok. It's ok. (Chuckles)

01:45:21.983 --> 01:45:22.984
Take it out.

01:45:24.319 --> 01:45:26.321

(Bernardo grunts)

01:45:40.502 --> 01:45:42.462
(All shouting maniacally)

01:45:55.892 --> 01:45:58.144
(Siren wailing in distance)

01:45:58.228 --> 01:46:00.647
(Suspenseful music playing)

01:46:12.700 --> 01:46:14.410
Tony, come on!

01:46:15.161 --> 01:46:17.247
Come on! Come on.

01:46:18.039 --> 01:46:19.707
Tony, come on!

01:46:25.922 --> 01:46:26.923

01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:00.873
(Woman speaking Spanish)

01:47:02.292 --> 01:47:03.293
(Speaks Spanish)

01:47:03.376 --> 01:47:05.256
We're gonna get apartments
in the new buildings.

01:47:05.336 --> 01:47:06.963
(Women laughing)

01:47:07.046 --> 01:47:08.715
Right where we live now.

01:47:08.798 --> 01:47:10.508
Ay, nena, we're gonna get evicted.

01:47:10.592 --> 01:47:12.302
(Speaking Spanish)

01:47:12.385 --> 01:47:13.469
The new apartments,

01:47:13.553 --> 01:47:15.722
the metropolitan opera,
the orchestra hall?

01:47:15.805 --> 01:47:18.516
- Not for us, for the gringos.
- (Assents in Spanish)

01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:20.768
That's why I cashed my relocation check

01:47:20.852 --> 01:47:22.770
inmediatamente.
(Continues in Spanish)

01:47:22.854 --> 01:47:24.248
- Before they take it back.
- Mm-hmm.

01:47:24.272 --> 01:47:27.108
You cashed the check? I tore mine up.

01:47:27.191 --> 01:47:30.236
- Uh-huh.
- You tore up a $500 check?

01:47:30.612 --> 01:47:31.922
- (Speaks Spanish)
- (Others chuckle)

01:47:31.946 --> 01:47:34.574
Once you cash the check,
mi'jita, they can evict you!

01:47:34.657 --> 01:47:37.201
I mailed mine right back
to the public works.

01:47:38.161 --> 01:47:40.788
- (Waltz music playing)
- (Conversing in Spanish)

01:47:44.250 --> 01:47:45.585
A ver, Bernardo ain't keeping

01:47:45.668 --> 01:47:47.712
their dirty money, verdad, Maria?

01:47:48.129 --> 01:47:50.089
Maria? (Speaks Spanish)

01:47:50.173 --> 01:47:51.341
Get down from there!

01:47:51.424 --> 01:47:52.842
(Speaks Spanish)

01:47:53.801 --> 01:47:56.429
We have eight floors to clean! Maria!

01:47:56.512 --> 01:47:58.348
Oh, I am terribly sorry, senora fausta,

01:47:58.431 --> 01:48:00.433
but I do not clean floors. No, no, no.

01:48:00.516 --> 01:48:04.479
I wear my $17.98 silk shawl...

01:48:04.562 --> 01:48:05.897
Ha-ha. (Speaks Spanish)

01:48:05.980 --> 01:48:07.023
Now get down.

02:02:16.079 --> 02:02:19.208
Anita, no

02:02:19.291 --> 02:02:21.418
it isn't true not for me

02:02:21.502 --> 02:02:23.837
it's true for you not for me

02:02:23.921 --> 02:02:26.215
I hear your words and in my head

02:02:26.298 --> 02:02:29.801
I know they're smart
but my heart, Anita

02:02:29.885 --> 02:02:31.178
but my heart knows they're wrong

02:02:31.261 --> 02:02:32.572
a boy like that
who'd kill your brother

02:02:32.596 --> 02:02:33.740
Maria:
And my heart is too strong

02:02:33.764 --> 02:02:35.641
forget that boy and find another

02:02:35.724 --> 02:02:37.351
-forl belong
-one of your own kind

02:02:37.434 --> 02:02:38.894
stick to your own kind

02:02:38.977 --> 02:02:42.064
to him alone, to him alone
one thing I know

02:02:42.147 --> 02:02:44.942
-a boy who kills cannot love
-i am his

02:02:45.025 --> 02:02:47.653
-I don't care what he is
-a boy who kills has no heart

02:02:48.028 --> 02:02:49.488
I don't know why it's so

02:02:49.571 --> 02:02:50.948
and he's the boy
who gets your love

02:02:51.031 --> 02:02:53.075
-I don't want to know
-and gets your heart

02:02:53.158 --> 02:02:55.160
very smart, Maria very smart

02:02:55.369 --> 02:02:58.288
oh, no, Anita, no

02:02:58.372 --> 02:03:00.457
you should know better

02:03:00.541 --> 02:03:03.085
you were in love or so you said

02:03:03.919 --> 02:03:07.589
-you should know better
-(Music slows)

02:03:15.347 --> 02:03:20.435
I have a love

02:03:20.519 --> 02:03:26.191
and it's all that I have

02:03:26.984 --> 02:03:29.236
right or wrong

02:03:29.319 --> 02:03:33.699
what else can I do?

02:03:34.533 --> 02:03:37.411
I love him

02:03:37.995 --> 02:03:40.998
I'm his

02:03:41.081 --> 02:03:46.587
and everything he is

02:03:47.129 --> 02:03:52.134
I am, too

02:03:54.094 --> 02:03:59.099
I have a love

02:03:59.516 --> 02:04:05.230
-and it's all that I need
-(Crying)

02:04:05.564 --> 02:04:08.025
Right or wrong

02:04:08.108 --> 02:04:12.362
and he needs me, too

02:04:13.196 --> 02:04:16.158
I love him

02:04:16.241 --> 02:04:18.785
we 're one

02:04:19.161 --> 02:04:25.208
there's nothing to be done

02:04:25.292 --> 02:04:30.130
not a thing I can do

02:04:31.506 --> 02:04:34.718
but hold him

02:04:34.801 --> 02:04:40.474
hold him forever

02:04:41.058 --> 02:04:44.770
be with him now

02:04:44.853 --> 02:04:47.481
tomorrow

02:04:47.564 --> 02:04:51.652
and all

02:04:51.735 --> 02:04:56.740
of my life

02:05:01.995 --> 02:05:03.413
(Music swells)

02:05:05.582 --> 02:05:06.917
(Sobbing)

02:05:11.088 --> 02:05:16.885
When love comes so strong

02:05:17.969 --> 02:05:23.433
there is no right or wrong

02:05:24.267 --> 02:05:29.856
your lo ve is

02:05:29.940 --> 02:05:34.945
your life

02:05:35.028 --> 02:05:37.531
- (both vocalizing end note)
- (Music swelling)

02:05:44.496 --> 02:05:45.747
(Maria crying)

02:05:48.041 --> 02:05:49.251
(Anita sniffling)

02:05:56.675 --> 02:05:59.052
(Voice breaking)
He will never be safe here.

02:06:00.429 --> 02:06:02.222
Si, lo se.

02:06:02.305 --> 02:06:04.558
And no one will ever forgive him.

02:06:06.852 --> 02:06:08.103
Will you?

02:06:10.021 --> 02:06:12.315
You can't ever ask me that.

02:06:14.568 --> 02:06:16.737
Will you forgive me?

02:06:18.905 --> 02:06:23.368
Te quiero, mi nifia,
but he will have to go away.

02:06:24.286 --> 02:06:26.621
And you will have to go with him.

02:06:37.549 --> 02:06:38.675
(Music fades off)

02:06:41.386 --> 02:06:42.429
(Switch clicks)

02:06:42.512 --> 02:06:43.638
(Inquires in Spanish)

02:06:48.185 --> 02:06:50.687
(Conversing in Spanish)

02:06:59.738 --> 02:07:01.907
Quique: It got so bad so fast.

02:07:02.657 --> 02:07:04.659
(Resume conversing in Spanish)

02:07:08.622 --> 02:07:10.332
Quique: He was a hero.

02:07:11.166 --> 02:07:13.210
I know people say that
about a lot of people...

02:07:13.293 --> 02:07:14.711
(Chico speaks Spanish)

02:07:17.214 --> 02:07:19.132
Bernardo was a fool.

02:07:20.258 --> 02:07:21.718
What did he die for?

02:07:21.802 --> 02:07:24.137
Murio iuchando por su dignidad...

02:07:24.221 --> 02:07:28.475
And for pride, mi hermano,
orgullo puertorriquefio!

02:07:28.558 --> 02:07:30.936
Bernardo, he died to show those gringos

02:07:31.019 --> 02:07:32.562
how tough Puerto Ricans are.

02:07:32.646 --> 02:07:33.647
(Speaks Spanish)

02:07:33.730 --> 02:07:35.524
And if they push us too far...

02:07:35.607 --> 02:07:38.068
If those nobodies can take
your pride away from you,

02:07:38.151 --> 02:07:39.611
tu eres mas estupido que Bernardo.

02:07:39.694 --> 02:07:41.321
(All shout indistinctly)

02:07:44.950 --> 02:07:45.951
(Speaking Spanish)

02:07:48.662 --> 02:07:50.330
It's a big world.

02:07:51.790 --> 02:07:55.418
Bernardo let the gringos tell him
there's only this barrio,

02:07:55.502 --> 02:07:57.546
these 20 bad blocks.

02:07:59.130 --> 02:08:01.383
(Speaking Spanish)

02:08:05.053 --> 02:08:07.138
Don't you do what Bernardo did.

02:08:08.265 --> 02:08:10.767
You kill a gringo, they kill you.

02:08:12.853 --> 02:08:16.147
Sooner or later,
the gringos kill everything.

02:08:16.898 --> 02:08:18.984
Chino, chino, chino, por favor.

02:08:20.610 --> 02:08:21.987
(Speaking Spanish)

02:08:26.366 --> 02:08:27.951
Don't follow me.

02:08:34.165 --> 02:08:35.584
(Pants)

02:08:37.711 --> 02:08:39.337
Bernardo was your husband?

02:08:39.421 --> 02:08:40.422
Anita: Yes.

02:08:40.964 --> 02:08:43.049
Oh. Close enough.

02:08:44.384 --> 02:08:46.153
Your brother was angry
you danced with a white boy

02:08:46.177 --> 02:08:47.596
at the mixer last night.

02:08:48.138 --> 02:08:50.765
No. I don't think so.

02:08:51.516 --> 02:08:53.727
You don't think the boy
you danced with was white?

02:08:53.810 --> 02:08:56.021
Or you don't think Bernardo was angry?

02:08:56.855 --> 02:08:59.065
I wouldn't dance with a white boy.

02:08:59.149 --> 02:09:00.317
Yeah?

02:09:01.318 --> 02:09:03.486
I heard you came with a date.

02:09:03.570 --> 02:09:05.947
Some, uh, puerto rican boy.

02:09:06.031 --> 02:09:08.825
Goes by the street name "chino."

02:09:11.745 --> 02:09:13.830
Word is, chino's got a gun.

02:09:18.335 --> 02:09:20.378
That's what the word is, anyway.

02:09:22.088 --> 02:09:23.733
- He's armed...
- (Sewing machine whirring)

02:09:23.757 --> 02:09:25.837
(Raises voice) ...And hunting
for this white stranger

02:09:25.884 --> 02:09:27.427
who she danced with,

02:09:27.510 --> 02:09:29.262
who we think killed your boyfriend!

02:09:29.346 --> 02:09:30.472
(Whirring stops)

02:09:31.056 --> 02:09:32.933
Anything else you wanna add?

02:09:34.225 --> 02:09:35.894
Bernardo told me about you.

02:09:35.977 --> 02:09:36.978
I'm flattered.

02:09:38.063 --> 02:09:39.856
The way you talked to him.

02:09:46.112 --> 02:09:47.447
Chino is gentle.

02:09:47.530 --> 02:09:49.199
He doesn't have a gun.

02:09:49.282 --> 02:09:50.450
Apparently, now he does.

02:09:50.533 --> 02:09:51.952
(Sewing machine whirring)

02:09:56.164 --> 02:09:57.374
I have a, uh...

02:09:57.457 --> 02:09:58.583
(Speaking Spanish)

02:09:58.667 --> 02:09:59.668
A headache?

02:10:00.043 --> 02:10:01.711
She has her monthly, you know?

02:10:01.878 --> 02:10:03.254
I get the picture.

02:10:03.338 --> 02:10:05.215
I need for this, uh, medicine.

02:10:05.298 --> 02:10:07.759
Anita, she can... she can go for me?

02:10:08.510 --> 02:10:10.303
- Mamita...
- (Whirring)

02:10:10.387 --> 02:10:11.805
(Speaking Spanish)

02:10:12.931 --> 02:10:14.808
In English.

02:10:17.143 --> 02:10:18.436
Si. Si.

02:10:18.520 --> 02:10:20.230
English is hard to, uh...

02:10:20.313 --> 02:10:21.898
Yeah, I bet it is.

02:10:23.149 --> 02:10:25.193
She wants you to go to doc's drugstore

02:10:25.276 --> 02:10:26.903
- and ask Valentina for...
- (Cloth rips)

02:10:30.198 --> 02:10:32.325
Hot tea is how my wife handles it.

02:10:32.409 --> 02:10:33.535
(Speaking Spanish)

02:10:33.618 --> 02:10:34.786
What did I say?

02:10:34.869 --> 02:10:36.454
Tell Valentina,

02:10:36.538 --> 02:10:40.041
I hope her cousin arrived safe
from santurce.

02:10:40.125 --> 02:10:43.086
And I'm sorry I can't be there
to meet him like I promised.

02:10:43.169 --> 02:10:44.629
And all of a sudden, fluency.

02:10:44.713 --> 02:10:45.839
(Speaks Spanish)

02:10:45.922 --> 02:10:47.799
That means "I'll come as soon as I can."

02:10:47.882 --> 02:10:48.967
I can go?

02:10:49.050 --> 02:10:50.885
You're not his widow or anything.

02:10:50.969 --> 02:10:52.387
I'm done with you.

02:10:56.433 --> 02:10:57.517
(Door opens)

02:10:59.936 --> 02:11:00.979
(Sighs)

02:11:06.484 --> 02:11:08.778
(Breath trembling)

02:11:18.079 --> 02:11:19.205
(Schrank sighs)

02:11:19.914 --> 02:11:22.250
Must be tough, losing a brother.

02:11:24.127 --> 02:11:27.088
So, let's start from the beginning.

02:11:33.219 --> 02:11:34.859
Graziella: (Tearfully)
I wanna go see him.

02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:37.140
Talk to him.

02:11:37.223 --> 02:11:38.725
Tonyjust wants to be alone right now,

02:11:38.808 --> 02:11:40.018
he don't wanna see us.

02:11:40.101 --> 02:11:41.102
A-rab: He ain't alone.

02:11:41.561 --> 02:11:43.063
The old lady's down there with him.

02:11:43.146 --> 02:11:45.565
Does he know we're up here?
Me and grazie?

02:11:45.982 --> 02:11:48.359
Does he know I'm here?

02:11:49.486 --> 02:11:51.905
Tony cared about me once.

02:11:51.988 --> 02:11:53.573
He don't wanna see you, grazie.

02:11:55.366 --> 02:11:56.910
Go home.

02:11:57.535 --> 02:11:59.370
We left him lying there.

02:12:01.164 --> 02:12:02.665
In the salt shed.

02:12:03.917 --> 02:12:05.043
Ice...

02:12:06.169 --> 02:12:07.170
I know.

02:12:07.253 --> 02:12:08.671
That's bothering me.

02:12:09.881 --> 02:12:11.508
Bothers me, too, deez.

02:12:12.884 --> 02:12:14.469
Anybodys: He ain't there anymore.

02:12:14.552 --> 02:12:15.804
Action: Jesus Christ.

02:12:15.887 --> 02:12:16.967
Ice: Where'd you come from?

02:12:17.097 --> 02:12:19.015
Down the chimney like santy claus.

02:12:19.099 --> 02:12:20.100
What's Tony gonna do?

02:12:21.267 --> 02:12:23.269
Go pop yourself, ya blister.

02:12:23.978 --> 02:12:26.606
How long's he figure
on holing up down there?

02:12:26.689 --> 02:12:27.941
Till the heat dies down.

02:12:28.108 --> 02:12:29.609
When's that gonna happen?

02:12:31.653 --> 02:12:33.780
Two guys died, so...

02:12:34.364 --> 02:12:35.406
Never ever.

02:12:44.999 --> 02:12:47.127
Bernardo's friend, chino?

02:12:49.295 --> 02:12:51.214
He has riff's gun.

02:12:52.632 --> 02:12:54.259
Oh, Jesus.

02:12:54.342 --> 02:12:56.177
And he's hunting for Tony.

02:12:57.303 --> 02:12:58.888
What are we gonna do?

02:12:59.556 --> 02:13:00.890
I don't know.

02:13:03.268 --> 02:13:04.519
Where you going?

02:13:05.103 --> 02:13:06.646
To keep track of chino.

02:13:07.272 --> 02:13:09.149
Yeah, yeah. Good. You do that.

02:13:09.774 --> 02:13:10.984
In and out of shadows.

02:13:11.067 --> 02:13:12.193
That's how.

02:13:12.861 --> 02:13:13.945
- Hey.
- (Door opens)

02:13:19.242 --> 02:13:20.493
You done good, buddy boy.

02:13:34.007 --> 02:13:35.341
Leave.

02:13:49.939 --> 02:13:52.483
I want to see your friend, Tony.

02:13:52.567 --> 02:13:55.236
He's here? He's supposed to be.

02:13:59.407 --> 02:14:01.534
I have a message for him.

02:14:11.044 --> 02:14:12.378
Where is Valentina?

02:14:12.879 --> 02:14:14.505
You're Bernardo's girl.

02:14:14.589 --> 02:14:16.049
We saw you at the gym.

02:14:16.424 --> 02:14:18.384
Yeah, you wanna dance, chiquita banana?

02:14:18.468 --> 02:14:20.803
Dancing up a storm, you was,
dipping them hips.

02:14:21.012 --> 02:14:22.013
Valentina!

02:14:22.096 --> 02:14:23.223
(Speaking Spanish)

02:14:26.434 --> 02:14:27.644
Spanish?

02:14:27.727 --> 02:14:29.354
You come here speaking Spanish?

02:14:29.437 --> 02:14:30.688
I wasn't talking to you.

02:14:30.772 --> 02:14:33.316
No Spanish. Not with us. Not today.

02:14:33.399 --> 02:14:34.692
(Anita scoffs)

02:14:42.325 --> 02:14:43.534
Let me pass.

02:14:43.618 --> 02:14:45.119
You heard her, boys.

02:14:46.162 --> 02:14:47.247
She wants to pass.

02:14:47.330 --> 02:14:48.998
Hmm, she's too dark to pass.

02:14:49.958 --> 02:14:51.251
Let her go.

02:14:51.876 --> 02:14:53.753
No one wants you here.

02:14:55.338 --> 02:14:57.590
Why don't you dance for us first?

02:14:57.674 --> 02:14:59.008
(Jukebox clicks)

02:14:59.092 --> 02:15:01.636
(Latin dance music playing on jukebox)

02:15:04.555 --> 02:15:07.684
Dance with me, darling,
like you danced at the gym.

02:15:07.767 --> 02:15:09.435
Numbers, stop it.

02:15:10.019 --> 02:15:11.354
Stop it.

02:15:11.437 --> 02:15:12.605
Cutting in.

02:15:13.106 --> 02:15:14.107
Balkan, out of here.

02:15:14.190 --> 02:15:15.542
A-rab: Come on, you pig,
let's see you move!

02:15:15.566 --> 02:15:16.693
Anita: No, no, no.

02:15:17.485 --> 02:15:19.320
Bernardo's black pig.

02:15:21.614 --> 02:15:23.616
Woman: Hey! Stop touching her!

02:15:23.700 --> 02:15:25.118
Graziella: Boys, don't do this!

02:15:25.493 --> 02:15:27.120
Anita: No!
Graziella: Tiger, let her go!

02:15:27.704 --> 02:15:28.997
Graziella: Let her go!

02:15:29.080 --> 02:15:31.165
Ice, enough! Enough!

02:15:32.041 --> 02:15:33.293
Anita: Help me!

02:15:33.376 --> 02:15:34.961
(Clamouring)

02:15:35.044 --> 02:15:36.170
Graziella: No!

02:15:37.255 --> 02:15:38.506
Don't hurt her!

02:15:38.589 --> 02:15:39.757
Open the door!

02:15:39.841 --> 02:15:40.883
Mouthpiece: Keep moving!

02:15:40.967 --> 02:15:42.176
Graziella: Don't hurt her!

02:15:42.260 --> 02:15:44.095
Don't hurt her, please!

02:15:44.178 --> 02:15:46.055
- (Music continues)
- (Boys grunting)

02:15:46.556 --> 02:15:48.641
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

02:15:48.725 --> 02:15:50.768
What the hell are you doing?

02:15:50.852 --> 02:15:53.229
You disgusting pieces of shit!

02:15:53.313 --> 02:15:54.957
- (Music stops)
- (Valentina speaks Spanish)

02:15:54.981 --> 02:15:56.190
(Anita whimpering)

02:15:56.274 --> 02:15:58.568
- Mija, mr'ja.
- No!

02:15:58.651 --> 02:15:59.902
(Shouts in Spanish)

02:16:00.862 --> 02:16:02.238
Traitor!

02:16:04.073 --> 02:16:05.908
(Speaking Spanish)

02:16:12.081 --> 02:16:13.875
Go back where you came from.

02:16:21.090 --> 02:16:23.509
You think I want to stay here?

02:16:23.593 --> 02:16:26.888
In this city full of ugly,
little animals like you?

02:16:28.973 --> 02:16:30.141
No, gracias.

02:16:34.687 --> 02:16:36.689
(Speaking Spanish)

02:16:44.447 --> 02:16:45.656
Tell Tony... (Sniffles)

02:16:46.907 --> 02:16:48.868
You tell that murderer...

02:16:50.286 --> 02:16:52.245
Maria ain't coming.

02:16:53.081 --> 02:16:56.084
Chino, he found out about them...

02:16:56.166 --> 02:16:57.752
Tony and Maria.

02:17:03.174 --> 02:17:04.759
He shot her.

02:17:05.760 --> 02:17:07.969
Maria is dead.

02:17:10.639 --> 02:17:12.350
You tell him that.

02:17:23.111 --> 02:17:24.195
(Door closes)

02:17:31.619 --> 02:17:33.204
I know you.

02:17:34.914 --> 02:17:38.000
I know all of your names.

02:17:39.377 --> 02:17:41.337
Since you was born.

02:17:43.339 --> 02:17:45.216
(Voice quivering)
I watched you grow up.

02:17:46.925 --> 02:17:50.638
And you have grown into rapists.

02:18:05.403 --> 02:18:07.612
You dishonour yourselves.

02:18:09.781 --> 02:18:12.493
You dishonour your dead.

02:18:17.582 --> 02:18:18.958
(Door opens)

02:18:19.500 --> 02:18:21.127
What do we do now?

02:18:21.502 --> 02:18:22.503
(Door closes)

02:18:24.004 --> 02:18:25.298
We're done.

02:18:35.892 --> 02:18:37.309
(Object rattles)

02:18:45.651 --> 02:18:47.445
What was that? What was that?

02:18:47.528 --> 02:18:48.797
You can never hear nothing
from down here.

02:18:48.821 --> 02:18:50.048
- Was it the cops?
- No, no, no.

02:18:50.072 --> 02:18:52.532
It was not police.
No, it was... it was...

02:18:52.617 --> 02:18:54.869
Uh... now it's alright.

02:18:54.951 --> 02:18:57.245
Tony, let's sit down for a second, huh?

02:18:57.330 --> 02:18:59.957
Listen. I got something to ask you.

02:19:00.040 --> 02:19:01.791
No, no, wait. I... I...
I got something...

02:19:01.876 --> 02:19:04.128
It ain't easy to ask this,
so let me just go, ok?

02:19:04.212 --> 02:19:05.439
Wait, wait. I have something to...

02:19:05.463 --> 02:19:07.298
You've given me so much already,

02:19:07.380 --> 02:19:09.424
but when she gets here,

02:19:09.509 --> 02:19:10.550
just...

02:19:11.260 --> 02:19:13.596
If you could help us out
with the bus fare...

02:19:13.679 --> 02:19:14.680
-Tony...

02:19:14.763 --> 02:19:16.157
I have no idea what it's gonna cost

02:19:16.182 --> 02:19:18.601
to get far enough away,
out west some place.

02:19:18.683 --> 02:19:20.102
100 bucks for both of us.

02:19:20.186 --> 02:19:23.022
And we'll get work when we get there.

02:19:23.814 --> 02:19:26.150
We'll pay you back every cent.

02:19:28.443 --> 02:19:30.547
I know you ain't got money,
so if it's too much to ask...

02:19:30.571 --> 02:19:32.573
No, no, no. It's not too much.

02:19:32.656 --> 02:19:34.700
It's not too much.
(Inhales sharply)

02:19:36.285 --> 02:19:38.620
We're gonna name
all our girls Valentina.

02:19:38.955 --> 02:19:40.456
- Hmm.
- Cause if you hadn't cared

02:19:40.540 --> 02:19:41.790
for me like you always done,

02:19:41.874 --> 02:19:44.252
I wouldn't even be here alive, which...

02:19:44.794 --> 02:19:46.462
Maybe I shouldn't be.

02:19:46.546 --> 02:19:48.965
Don't ever say that, Tony.

02:19:49.799 --> 02:19:52.760
Life matters even more than love.

02:19:52.843 --> 02:19:54.887
Mm. They're the same thing.

02:19:55.555 --> 02:19:58.975
Before Maria,
maybe I would've said they ain't.

02:19:59.058 --> 02:20:01.852
But now, it's all life is.

02:20:02.853 --> 02:20:05.147
Even if it lasts no time at all.

02:20:05.231 --> 02:20:07.692
A month, a day even.

02:20:08.276 --> 02:20:10.236
That was Anita upstairs.

02:20:12.113 --> 02:20:13.364
What's wrong?

02:20:14.323 --> 02:20:15.658
Chino...

02:20:16.242 --> 02:20:17.368
What?

02:20:18.035 --> 02:20:19.912
Chino has a gun.

02:20:22.123 --> 02:20:25.626
Chino shot Maria.

02:20:29.463 --> 02:20:31.215
He killed her.

02:20:31.882 --> 02:20:33.718
She's... she's dead.

02:20:34.260 --> 02:20:35.678
(Tony whimpers)

02:20:35.761 --> 02:20:37.221
(Tony crying)

02:20:48.816 --> 02:20:50.818
(Footsteps running up stairs)

02:20:53.487 --> 02:20:54.822
(Door opens)

02:20:54.905 --> 02:20:57.116
(Gasping and whimpering)

02:21:01.245 --> 02:21:02.997
(Panting)

02:21:09.378 --> 02:21:10.796
Tony: Chino!

02:21:11.756 --> 02:21:13.132
Chino!

02:21:14.008 --> 02:21:15.426
Where are you?

02:21:21.307 --> 02:21:22.892
Chino!

02:21:25.102 --> 02:21:26.896
I'm right here!

02:21:28.939 --> 02:21:30.524
(Tearfully) Chino!

02:21:31.108 --> 02:21:32.735
Chino!

02:21:34.070 --> 02:21:35.655
Come on, man!

02:21:35.738 --> 02:21:37.448
I'm right here!

02:21:39.575 --> 02:21:41.369
I'm looking for you!

02:21:41.452 --> 02:21:43.579
Come on! Come on, with me!

02:21:43.954 --> 02:21:45.539
I know how to hide you.

02:21:46.290 --> 02:21:47.833
I got places to go they'll never look,

02:21:47.917 --> 02:21:49.126
just please!

02:21:50.920 --> 02:21:52.546
Don't leave me here!

02:21:54.632 --> 02:21:56.509
Get off of me!

02:21:57.468 --> 02:21:59.512
Chino, kill me!

02:21:59.595 --> 02:22:01.722
Kill me, too, chino!

02:22:04.975 --> 02:22:06.477
(Panting)

02:22:09.188 --> 02:22:10.898
Chino!

02:22:18.948 --> 02:22:19.949
(Chuckles softly)

02:22:28.541 --> 02:22:30.000
(Maria shrieks)

02:22:31.669 --> 02:22:33.379
(Crying)

02:22:36.382 --> 02:22:38.718
Mi amor mio, mi corazon.

02:22:40.386 --> 02:22:41.679
(Softly) Maria.

02:22:42.680 --> 02:22:43.973
Maria.

02:22:44.390 --> 02:22:46.016
(Continues crying)

02:22:49.395 --> 02:22:51.605
(Singing) Onlyyou

02:22:53.649 --> 02:22:57.027
you're the only thing I'll see

02:22:57.486 --> 02:22:59.321
(voice quivers) Forever

02:23:00.614 --> 02:23:02.950
in my eyes, in my words

02:23:03.033 --> 02:23:05.411
and in everything I do

02:23:06.370 --> 02:23:08.372
(voice breaking)
Nothing else but you

02:23:09.415 --> 02:23:10.791
ever (sobbing)

02:23:11.292 --> 02:23:13.127
(Tony breathing heavily)

02:23:15.921 --> 02:23:17.214
(Breathing stops)

02:23:18.299 --> 02:23:19.967
(Maria gasping)

02:23:21.010 --> 02:23:23.095
(Sobbing)

02:23:28.058 --> 02:23:30.102
(Sad music playing)

02:23:32.938 --> 02:23:35.024
(Maria continues sobbing)

02:23:55.920 --> 02:23:57.505
Give it to me.

02:23:57.588 --> 02:23:59.715
(Chino breathing shakily)

02:24:05.554 --> 02:24:07.348
How do you fire it?

02:24:09.058 --> 02:24:11.268
- Just pull this?
- (Breath quivers)

02:24:14.021 --> 02:24:15.940
(Shouting)
How many bullets are left?

02:24:17.817 --> 02:24:19.318
Enough for you?

02:24:22.947 --> 02:24:23.948
And you?

02:24:26.033 --> 02:24:27.368
All of you!

02:24:28.911 --> 02:24:31.914
I can kill now because I hate now.

02:24:36.293 --> 02:24:37.837
I hate now.

02:24:41.382 --> 02:24:43.509
How many can I kill, chino?

02:24:46.303 --> 02:24:48.889
And still have one bullet left for me!

02:24:48.973 --> 02:24:50.182
(Gasping)

02:24:53.644 --> 02:24:55.104
(Continues gasping)

02:24:59.525 --> 02:25:01.819
(Sad music continues)

02:25:06.949 --> 02:25:08.450
Te adoro, Anton.

02:25:12.663 --> 02:25:14.331
No, don't touch him!

02:25:14.665 --> 02:25:16.876
(Speaking Spanish)

02:25:27.469 --> 02:25:29.889
(Sad music continues)

02:26:09.595 --> 02:26:12.014
(Sad music continues)

02:26:40.584 --> 02:26:41.627
(Music fades off)

02:26:42.795 --> 02:26:45.214
(Slow dramatic music playing)

02:27:04.566 --> 02:27:05.567
(Music fades off)

02:27:07.569 --> 02:27:10.406
(Orchestral music playing)
