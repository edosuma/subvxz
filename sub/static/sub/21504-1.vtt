ORBIT 9

02:26.417 --> 02:29.167
<i>Oxygen level at one percent.</i>

02:48.626 --> 02:51.584
<i>The capsule will arrive in 17 hours.</i>

02:53.667 --> 02:54.751
I know.

02:58.126 --> 03:00.417
<i>You'll breathe better soon.</i>

03:00.667 --> 03:04.167
<i>You're going to meet the first human being
in your lifetime.</i>

03:04.709 --> 03:06.126
The third.

03:06.626 --> 03:08.584
<i>Don't be angry, Helena.</i>

03:08.751 --> 03:10.334
<i>It depends how you count.</i>

03:10.501 --> 03:11.834
I'm not angry.

03:16.417 --> 03:19.417
<i>Your mother and I have
discussed it a thousand times.</i>

03:19.751 --> 03:22.459
<i>We've repeated the calculations
over and over again.</i>

03:22.584 --> 03:24.376
<i>It's the best solution.</i>

03:25.251 --> 03:29.792
<i>The three of us on the ship would
have oxygen for a little over a year.</i>

03:30.959 --> 03:32.876
<i>But if you travel alone,</i>

03:33.542 --> 03:36.876
<i>the levels would last
four or five times longer.</i>

03:37.667 --> 03:38.667
<i>Helena,</i>

03:38.959 --> 03:42.459
<i>I wish I could have hugged
and kissed you one last time,</i>

03:42.584 --> 03:44.292
<i>but I know you.</i>

03:44.459 --> 03:46.834
<i>And I know you wouldn't
have let us do it.</i>

03:47.667 --> 03:48.834
<i>Please, be strong.</i>

03:49.334 --> 03:51.751
<i>Hang on until the engineer arrives.</i>

03:53.542 --> 03:55.251
<i>I know you'll make it.</i>

03:58.501 --> 04:00.459
<i>We love you very much.</i>

04:13.792 --> 04:15.751
<i>Time to get up, Helena.</i>

04:16.125 --> 04:19.541
<i>Day 7,409 of your voyage.</i>

04:19.750 --> 04:22.041
<i>Reserve oxygen activated.</i>

04:22.334 --> 04:24.876
<i>Weekly medical check-up waiting.</i>

04:29.459 --> 04:31.501
<i>Cardiac cycle correct.</i>

04:31.626 --> 04:34.376
<i>The ankle fissure
has almost closed.</i>

04:34.584 --> 04:37.251
<i>Don't push it the next few days.</i>

05:48.876 --> 05:50.584
<i>Coupling initiated.</i>

06:07.376 --> 06:09.251
<i>Maneuver completed.</i>

06:16.126 --> 06:18.709
<i>Opening outer lock.</i>

06:51.959 --> 06:54.251
Robotics engineer 11 beta 57.

06:57.667 --> 06:58.959
Helena.

06:59.376 --> 07:00.626
Nice to meet you, Helena.

07:00.792 --> 07:04.042
I only have 50 hours of autonomy.
It's that way, right?

07:10.209 --> 07:13.251
We never found out why
the oxygen matrix got misconfigured.

07:13.417 --> 07:16.459
It was sudden, not even the Rebecca unit
found an explanation.

07:16.626 --> 07:17.626
Right.

07:17.917 --> 07:19.667
It's rare but it happens sometimes.

07:20.959 --> 07:23.417
Even in bigger ships
than this one.

07:26.417 --> 07:27.959
Can you fix it?

07:28.501 --> 07:29.584
Yes.

07:41.167 --> 07:42.417
I'm the only one left.

07:46.959 --> 07:48.542
Three years ago...

07:50.042 --> 07:51.667
my parents left

07:51.876 --> 07:53.959
so that I could survive.

07:56.126 --> 07:57.417
I'm sorry.

08:02.084 --> 08:03.251
What's it called?

08:03.501 --> 08:04.667
It's called Kubic.

08:05.542 --> 08:07.751
It's a defective connection tracker.

08:07.959 --> 08:09.751
It'll help me work faster.

08:17.417 --> 08:19.542
Let me know if you need anything.

08:21.459 --> 08:22.542
Thanks.

09:04.042 --> 09:05.417
What's your name?

09:10.876 --> 09:11.959
Alex.

09:12.917 --> 09:14.626
Shall we have dinner together, Alex?

09:14.792 --> 09:17.542
No, I can't.
I have too much work.

09:18.876 --> 09:22.126
It's just that... I've never had a guest.

09:23.459 --> 09:25.584
Or eaten with anyone
besides my parents.

09:27.709 --> 09:29.542
You have to have dinner, right?

09:33.167 --> 09:34.501
In half an hour?

09:58.251 --> 10:00.709
They did the navigation calculation
and realized

10:00.876 --> 10:04.459
that traveling alone was the only way
to make it here.

10:04.584 --> 10:07.584
Where someone could
come and help me.

10:10.459 --> 10:12.626
Actually you were lucky, Helena.

10:13.709 --> 10:18.084
Yes, if the failure had occurred
at any other point in the journey,

10:18.251 --> 10:20.334
nobody would have heard
our distress call.

10:22.501 --> 10:23.709
That's right.

10:31.584 --> 10:34.959
You've really never been curious
to see Celeste?

10:35.667 --> 10:38.209
I don't have the strength
you colonists have.

10:42.542 --> 10:44.584
I've never seen anything else.

10:45.376 --> 10:47.959
I came on the ship as a baby
and if everything works out

10:48.751 --> 10:51.376
I'll be over 40 years old
when I get out.

10:55.667 --> 10:57.876
Sometimes I think it makes no sense.

11:00.667 --> 11:02.459
Spending half your life

11:02.584 --> 11:05.167
cooped up trying to get somewhere.

11:08.626 --> 11:11.584
But then I remember that
my parents were colonists.

11:14.209 --> 11:15.709
And that I am too.

11:18.376 --> 11:19.751
And that I have to reach Celeste,

11:19.917 --> 11:23.376
even if it's only for the sacrifice
they made for me.

11:33.792 --> 11:35.876
<i>Time to get up, Helena.</i>

11:36.126 --> 11:39.542
<i>Day 7,410 of your voyage.</i>

11:39.709 --> 11:42.126
<i>Oxygen reserve deactivated.</i>

12:04.334 --> 12:05.334
Hi.

12:08.626 --> 12:09.917
I can breathe better.

12:11.084 --> 12:12.876
I'm almost finished.

12:13.334 --> 12:14.667
It'll be ready tomorrow.

13:21.417 --> 13:23.542
I don't understand a word you say.

13:41.792 --> 13:43.084
Hi, Helena.

13:46.042 --> 13:48.501
I wanted to say I can't
have dinner tonight.

13:50.209 --> 13:51.292
Why not?

13:51.459 --> 13:55.251
I have 2 or 3 more hours
with Rebecca and I need to rest.

13:56.584 --> 13:57.709
Of course.

14:00.834 --> 14:02.292
Good night.

14:03.501 --> 14:04.584
Good night.

14:40.501 --> 14:42.542
<i>Cardiac cycle correct.</i>

14:42.792 --> 14:44.959
<i>Pulse slightly high.</i>

14:45.126 --> 14:47.209
<i>Arterial pressure normal.</i>

15:36.584 --> 15:37.959
What are you doing?

15:42.584 --> 15:43.959
Looking at you.

15:45.542 --> 15:46.667
Why?

15:52.292 --> 15:54.334
I've never kissed anyone.

16:00.917 --> 16:01.542
Helena...

16:01.709 --> 16:07.292
I'm going to spend
the next 20 years in here.

16:08.459 --> 16:09.959
By myself.

16:13.959 --> 16:16.584
But if you want me to leave,
I will.

18:07.917 --> 18:09.959
You're leaving without saying goodbye?

18:15.792 --> 18:17.626
I didn't want to wake you.

18:23.251 --> 18:25.292
I'm sorry about what happened
last night.

18:30.751 --> 18:32.126
I'm not.

19:24.542 --> 19:26.959
<i>Opening outer lock.</i>

21:17.042 --> 21:18.834
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

22:33.917 --> 22:35.626
ORBIT PROGRAM HEADQUARTERS

22:50.292 --> 22:53.084
<i>Base code in hangars 1,</i>

22:53.959 --> 22:59.167
<i>4, 7, 11, 12.</i>

22:59.501 --> 23:02.459
The turbine matrix reached 100
in the scale model.

23:03.084 --> 23:05.042
You know what that means,
right?

23:06.084 --> 23:10.417
That with a little luck we'll see
the first ships take off in 20 or 30 years.

23:10.584 --> 23:12.584
With a little luck and some care

23:12.751 --> 23:17.626
we'll probably still be alive
and see it with our own eyes.

23:21.501 --> 23:23.542
I thought you'd be more excited.

23:23.709 --> 23:25.292
I am excited, Hugo.

23:25.501 --> 23:27.042
You don't look it.

23:29.167 --> 23:30.459
What's wrong?

23:32.667 --> 23:33.917
I don't now.

23:36.834 --> 23:37.876
What?

23:39.126 --> 23:43.292
We've never wondered about
the passengers in the simulators...

23:43.459 --> 23:44.667
All the time.

23:44.834 --> 23:47.459
That's why we have the data
from their biowitnesses.

23:47.626 --> 23:49.084
But those are numbers.

23:49.251 --> 23:52.584
Yes, numbers. The most precise
language that exists.

23:52.751 --> 23:54.876
- But we're talking about something else.
- What?

23:55.042 --> 23:56.584
We're talking about people.

23:56.751 --> 23:58.959
We've always talked about people.

23:59.792 --> 24:01.709
But not about ten people.

24:02.667 --> 24:05.626
We're talking about 8 billion people.

24:07.334 --> 24:09.542
Alex, I've dedicated
half of my life

24:09.709 --> 24:10.959
to this project.

24:11.334 --> 24:13.709
And although you've only been
with us for 5 years,

24:13.876 --> 24:16.126
I know this is just as important
to you as it is to me.

24:19.209 --> 24:21.126
Pick up the Orbit 10 dossier,

24:21.292 --> 24:23.376
go home and get some rest.

24:24.126 --> 24:26.084
You have only one simulator left.

24:26.667 --> 24:28.792
When you've closed that last door,

24:28.959 --> 24:30.584
you'll see everything differently.

24:54.667 --> 24:55.959
Clean!

25:28.792 --> 25:31.584
<i>The Ministry of the Environment
announces that next week</i>

25:31.751 --> 25:36.334
<i>it will create more artificial storms
in all the northern districts of the city.</i>

25:36.501 --> 25:40.959
<i>They will be nocturnal rains that will
occur every Wednesday next month.</i>

25:41.084 --> 25:42.959
<i>Temperatures tomorrow...</i>

27:31.876 --> 27:34.959
Why don't you take this
to Monica?

27:35.667 --> 27:37.917
I don't think she'll like it.

27:38.626 --> 27:41.084
Come by the 99 one of these nights.

27:41.501 --> 27:43.292
We miss you, man.

27:51.042 --> 27:53.126
The test results came in yesterday.

27:53.292 --> 27:55.751
Come by the clinic anytime
to pick them up.

27:56.626 --> 27:58.542
Why don't you save me the trip?

27:59.751 --> 28:03.501
Your bones are fine, the analytics too.
You have radiation in your body

28:03.667 --> 28:05.751
but within normal parameters.

28:06.042 --> 28:09.959
You shouldn't have entered the simulators,
but you're a lucky bastard.

28:13.292 --> 28:16.209
Why don't you come over
for dinner tonight?

28:16.376 --> 28:20.084
- Monica will be happy to see you.
- I can't tonight, Chao.

28:22.626 --> 28:26.209
Don't worry, I promise
I won't turn on the TV.

28:37.501 --> 28:40.459
<i>Today is the 5th anniversary
of the first civilian flight</i>

28:40.626 --> 28:43.292
<i>with a completely android crew,</i>

28:43.459 --> 28:46.542
<i>a catastrophe that left 207 people dead
and a shadow of doubt</i>

28:46.959 --> 28:49.209
<i>over new industry trends.</i>

28:49.376 --> 28:52.167
<i>We tried to contact Alex Rojas,</i>

28:52.334 --> 28:55.584
<i>the Spaniard who created the
since-decommissioned Icarus 3000 pilots,</i>

28:55.751 --> 28:58.209
<i>but we were unable to locate him.</i>

28:58.417 --> 29:01.501
<i>Tonight we have several experts</i>

29:01.667 --> 29:04.126
<i>who will analyze
what might be the keys</i>

29:04.292 --> 29:08.084
<i>to making the new generation
of android crews 100% reliable.</i>

29:08.251 --> 29:10.751
<i>We'll speak to them
after this commercial.</i>

29:34.292 --> 29:36.792
<i>I don't understand a word you say.</i>

29:39.084 --> 29:40.459
<i>You know what?</i>

29:42.959 --> 29:47.876
<i>I should be happy because
Alex fixed the problem,</i>

29:51.334 --> 29:52.417
but...

29:54.417 --> 29:57.876
<i>I don't know why, but I'm not.</i>

30:01.292 --> 30:04.126
<i>I wish it would have
taken him longer.</i>

30:17.209 --> 30:23.084
<i>The first ships to Celeste
could take off in 15 years,</i>

30:23.251 --> 30:26.292
<i>but the boarding protocol
remains confusing</i>

30:26.459 --> 30:29.167
<i>and must be validated
by participating nations.</i>

30:29.334 --> 30:31.917
<i>Depending on the reproductive
capacity of the individual...</i>

30:32.042 --> 30:33.042
Good morning.

30:33.167 --> 30:34.167
Good morning.

31:41.084 --> 31:42.959
- Hi.
- Hi.

31:44.542 --> 31:48.334
Silvia will be a while, she still has
a couple of customers.

31:48.917 --> 31:50.126
I'll wait for her.

32:18.084 --> 32:19.917
<i>You've lost weight.</i>

32:20.126 --> 32:21.584
Is that a compliment?

32:23.084 --> 32:24.876
<i>It's a warning.</i>

32:26.959 --> 32:30.376
Silvia, how many sessions
have we had?

32:30.542 --> 32:32.959
<i>197 including today.</i>

32:34.376 --> 32:35.501
That many?

32:36.042 --> 32:38.542
<i>Well, that's what this screen says.</i>

32:41.417 --> 32:44.376
Then it's time to be straight
with each other.

32:45.917 --> 32:48.334
I thought we were
from the beginning, Alex.

32:48.751 --> 32:50.959
That's what this therapy is about.

32:54.626 --> 32:57.251
<i>There are passengers
inside the simulators.</i>

32:58.792 --> 33:00.042
I already know that.

33:00.209 --> 33:02.334
<i>No, you don't.</i>

33:03.584 --> 33:07.209
I'm not talking about the scientist
couples we all know.

33:13.084 --> 33:14.792
<i>They put babies inside.</i>

33:15.959 --> 33:17.667
<i>Babies that are adults now.</i>

33:18.876 --> 33:20.959
<i>They've been in there
their whole lives.</i>

33:22.167 --> 33:24.042
They think they're going to Celeste.

33:26.917 --> 33:27.959
I don't follow you.

33:28.667 --> 33:30.626
<i>Human guinea pigs.</i>

33:39.751 --> 33:41.751
Did you know all along?

33:42.209 --> 33:43.251
<i>Yes.</i>

36:10.209 --> 36:12.042
<i>Coupling initiated.</i>

36:15.126 --> 36:16.417
What's going on?

36:20.584 --> 36:21.834
What is this?

36:24.792 --> 36:26.626
Is there an assembly request?

36:27.042 --> 36:29.084
<i>Origin unknown, Helena.</i>

36:32.251 --> 36:34.792
<i>Opening outer lock.</i>

36:42.751 --> 36:44.792
<i>Maneuver completed.</i>

37:12.959 --> 37:15.251
I know this is going to sound
crazy to you,

37:16.417 --> 37:18.334
but we're not where you think.

37:19.876 --> 37:21.917
This isn't a ship, Helena.

37:22.584 --> 37:24.501
It's a simulator.

37:26.834 --> 37:28.834
On the other side of that door...

37:30.959 --> 37:32.876
is Earth.

37:37.126 --> 37:39.209
We have to get out of here
right now, Helena.

37:39.376 --> 37:42.126
Leave. Go back to your pod.

37:53.917 --> 37:55.959
It's been recording
since you were a baby.

37:56.126 --> 38:00.084
There are two more in this corridor
and another in the decompression chamber.

38:00.251 --> 38:02.834
I disconnected them.
We have to go.

38:05.167 --> 38:06.584
I told you to leave.

38:21.876 --> 38:23.376
It's a biowitness.

38:23.959 --> 38:26.251
They planted it inside you
when you were born.

38:26.417 --> 38:27.834
They check your vital signs.

38:30.126 --> 38:31.542
Let me take it out.

38:35.667 --> 38:36.917
It won't hurt.

38:41.917 --> 38:42.917
Helena.

38:42.959 --> 38:44.667
Helena... Helena!

38:53.084 --> 38:55.334
I want you to see something.

39:08.584 --> 39:11.834
We're going to send
your vital signs in a remote code.

39:13.876 --> 39:15.334
<i>Cardiac cycle correct.</i>

39:15.792 --> 39:17.667
<i>Pulse normal.</i>

39:17.834 --> 39:20.042
<i>Arterial pressure stable.</i>

39:42.584 --> 39:43.876
Rebecca?

39:43.959 --> 39:45.792
Rebecca is a navigation robot.

39:45.917 --> 39:48.292
She doesn't communicate
with the outside.

39:58.876 --> 40:00.167
Are you ready?

40:00.876 --> 40:03.042
<i>Opening outer lock.</i>

40:03.251 --> 40:04.501
Let's go.

40:57.292 --> 40:58.709
Come on, Helena.

41:00.334 --> 41:01.834
Don't be afraid.

41:02.876 --> 41:03.917
Come on.

41:08.292 --> 41:10.959
Helena, give me your hand.

41:19.167 --> 41:21.751
Good, Helena.
You're doing great.

41:30.751 --> 41:32.084
This way.

41:47.376 --> 41:48.834
That's it.

41:50.417 --> 41:51.876
We're almost there.

41:55.542 --> 41:57.959
I need you to ride
inside here, okay?

42:32.792 --> 42:34.876
<i>Simulation center, grid clean.</i>

42:35.042 --> 42:37.251
<i>Affirmative, check the next one.</i>

42:58.584 --> 43:00.751
The levels are higher than normal.

43:19.459 --> 43:20.667
It's the suit.

43:20.834 --> 43:22.709
You left it outside.

43:24.292 --> 43:25.667
Gate!

43:55.459 --> 43:57.876
The same thing happened
with the other ships.

43:58.876 --> 44:00.584
It was all agreed.

44:00.792 --> 44:02.167
Since when?

44:03.126 --> 44:05.126
Since before you were born.

44:08.959 --> 44:10.334
And you coming to the ship?

44:10.709 --> 44:11.959
That too.

44:13.084 --> 44:15.292
The oxygen was only an excuse.

44:15.959 --> 44:19.501
- It's checked in remote code.
- Then why did you go in?

44:19.667 --> 44:22.542
Technical inspection
of each Rebecca unit.

44:30.209 --> 44:31.751
I want to see them.

44:33.209 --> 44:34.917
Nobody can know you're out.

44:37.084 --> 44:38.251
But they're my parents.

44:38.417 --> 44:40.667
Nobody, Helena. Especially them.

44:40.917 --> 44:41.917
Why?

44:42.084 --> 44:43.876
Because they're military scientists.

44:44.042 --> 44:46.376
They've dedicated half their lives
to this project.

44:46.542 --> 44:49.459
- But they're my family.
- No, they're not.

44:50.334 --> 44:51.667
They're not.

46:06.167 --> 46:08.167
- What is that?
- Thunder.

46:10.126 --> 46:11.959
It's going to rain.

46:29.209 --> 46:30.501
Come on.

47:46.876 --> 47:48.959
I HAVE A MEETING
BACK IN 2 HOURS

47:57.167 --> 47:59.834
WE LIVE HERE, BUT DON'T GO OUT
WITHOUT ME!

48:00.959 --> 48:02.584
IF SOMEONE RINGS
DON'T OPEN DOOR

48:02.876 --> 48:04.459
DOWNSTAIRS SHOWER
DOESN'T WORK

48:05.334 --> 48:07.626
REMEMBER, I'LL BE BACK
IN 2 HOURS

48:27.792 --> 48:30.709
PLEASE DON'T MOVE THE PIECES

48:46.667 --> 48:48.542
What if they find out?

48:49.334 --> 48:51.167
<i>There's no reason they would.</i>

48:51.917 --> 48:53.584
That's not an answer, Alex.

48:54.626 --> 48:56.084
<i>What if something
goes wrong?</i>

48:56.959 --> 48:58.626
It's too dangerous.

48:59.876 --> 49:02.042
I'm willing to take that risk.

49:03.959 --> 49:05.167
Right.

49:06.042 --> 49:08.542
<i>That's what worries me.</i>

49:13.792 --> 49:14.917
Alex.

49:20.084 --> 49:22.834
Don't look at me like that.
Did you really think I was a wolf?

49:22.959 --> 49:25.751
No, but we're not supposed
to see each other.

49:28.792 --> 49:30.376
My cell phone.

49:31.376 --> 49:35.167
I have an apartment I never use
in Isaura District.

49:36.167 --> 49:38.209
If for any reason

49:38.376 --> 49:42.292
you need to disappear for a while,
you only have to call me.

49:42.834 --> 49:46.126
And please don't talk about
this subject in the booth again.

49:46.334 --> 49:49.084
Sometimes they record
the conversations randomly.

49:50.334 --> 49:52.376
Thank you, Silvia.
Really.

49:54.709 --> 49:56.376
Go on, get lost.

50:14.042 --> 50:15.126
Hi.

50:16.834 --> 50:20.626
It's weird, I've always had
the same clothes but in every size.

50:22.126 --> 50:25.334
So, where do you want to go?
What do you want to do?

50:26.959 --> 50:28.084
I don't know.

50:28.626 --> 50:30.876
What's your favorite place?

50:37.542 --> 50:41.209
Sometimes the simplest
mechanisms are actually

50:41.376 --> 50:42.959
the most complex.

50:46.126 --> 50:48.792
I could spend my whole life
looking at them.

50:50.042 --> 50:51.251
They're weird,

50:52.084 --> 50:53.417
but pretty.

50:58.167 --> 50:59.917
Is the sea far away?

51:01.459 --> 51:04.042
The sea isn't like you imagine it
anymore.

51:07.459 --> 51:10.251
The acid tides destroyed everything.

51:11.959 --> 51:16.709
If nobody fixes it, soon they'll only
be able to live in places like this.

51:17.751 --> 51:19.584
Did you ever go in the water?

51:19.834 --> 51:23.126
Yeah, when I was six or seven.

51:23.417 --> 51:24.792
But I didn't like it.

51:24.959 --> 51:27.126
I can't imagine you
at six or seven years old.

51:27.334 --> 51:28.876
I was practically like I am now.

51:29.292 --> 51:30.584
Shy...

51:30.792 --> 51:31.792
Look.

51:35.042 --> 51:37.459
I was antisocial,

51:37.917 --> 51:39.751
Coke-bottle glasses...

51:39.917 --> 51:40.626
A freak.

51:40.792 --> 51:43.209
A freak?
What's a freak?

51:43.334 --> 51:44.459
A freak is...

51:44.959 --> 51:46.167
different.

51:46.292 --> 51:49.126
Then I'm a freak too.

52:03.667 --> 52:05.917
You have to hold the chopstick
with this finger.

52:07.334 --> 52:08.626
Why do you use chopsticks?

52:08.792 --> 52:11.792
You have to use this finger.

52:17.209 --> 52:19.667
- Why do you eat with sticks?
- Open your mouth.

53:32.292 --> 53:33.584
Good morning.

53:38.542 --> 53:40.667
What's in the room downstairs?

53:41.709 --> 53:43.542
The one I can't go in.

54:02.459 --> 54:05.209
There are no cameras
in the bedroom or the common areas.

54:05.417 --> 54:08.709
Only the ones you saw in the corridor
and the entrance.

54:09.167 --> 54:11.167
I only had to hack the first one.

54:11.334 --> 54:13.876
And when they see
I'm not getting older...

54:14.417 --> 54:16.042
or that I always do the same thing?

54:16.334 --> 54:19.376
We'll record your signal from here
and send it whenever we want.

54:19.542 --> 54:20.542
It's easy.

54:24.667 --> 54:27.876
What will they do with the rest
of the passengers in 20 years

54:28.042 --> 54:30.042
at the end of the voyage?

54:31.542 --> 54:34.334
The Rebecca unit will inform them
of a supposed error

54:34.459 --> 54:36.859
in the navigation chart
and it will be extended indefinitely.

54:37.667 --> 54:38.751
What for?

54:41.584 --> 54:44.584
To study their vital signs longer.

54:51.584 --> 54:53.084
How much longer?

54:55.459 --> 54:58.292
The simulators will only
open the doors

54:59.709 --> 55:03.126
when the biowitnesses confirm
that each passenger is deceased.

55:04.167 --> 55:05.459
How...

55:07.334 --> 55:10.167
How could you get involved
in something like this?

55:14.042 --> 55:16.167
I'd like to show you something.

55:20.042 --> 55:22.751
Hugo came into my life
shortly thereafter.

55:25.959 --> 55:27.834
<i>When he explained
the experiment to me,</i>

55:27.959 --> 55:31.959
<i>I guess I only wanted to see
the positive side of the project.</i>

55:36.126 --> 55:38.459
With the Earth-Celeste
voyage simulation

55:38.959 --> 55:41.209
<i>we can save millions of lives</i>

55:41.376 --> 55:43.084
<i>across the world...</i>

55:44.584 --> 55:46.626
<i>when the trips become a reality.</i>

55:48.501 --> 55:50.751
<i>That's all I took into account.</i>

55:53.292 --> 55:54.751
<i>So...</i>

55:55.084 --> 55:59.626
you put it all on a scale
and didn't mind sacrificing ten people?

56:01.959 --> 56:02.959
No.

56:04.167 --> 56:05.667
I didn't at the time.

56:20.167 --> 56:22.042
- I love it when you're upset.
- Oh, Marta.

56:22.167 --> 56:26.209
It's true.
That's the reason I married her.

56:26.376 --> 56:29.417
- I'm being serious.
- So am I.

56:29.584 --> 56:32.126
12 hours with no water every day.

56:32.334 --> 56:35.292
And we're the lucky ones,
in other sectors it's worse.

56:36.792 --> 56:40.042
So you two met in Spain
when you were kids?

56:41.917 --> 56:43.209
That's right.

56:45.334 --> 56:48.626
I had no idea Alex worked here.

56:48.792 --> 56:51.959
When I ran into him at the lab,
I couldn't believe it.

56:52.459 --> 56:54.792
Of course.
What a surprise!

56:54.959 --> 56:57.209
Helena's a brilliant
computer technician.

56:57.417 --> 56:59.542
No wonder they went over there
to find her.

56:59.709 --> 57:01.626
And you're like Alex, right?

57:01.792 --> 57:03.751
You can't talk about
the Orbit program.

57:03.917 --> 57:05.167
Confidential information.

57:10.084 --> 57:11.667
What do you think, Chao?

57:12.334 --> 57:14.876
Alex said you're not convinced
about the trip to Celeste.

57:17.542 --> 57:20.876
Well, I think at some point
we'll have to make a decision.

57:21.042 --> 57:24.417
Either go back to being
the cavemen we once were,

57:24.584 --> 57:25.959
or travel to Celeste.

57:26.167 --> 57:28.792
But you still think
things can be fixed here.

57:28.959 --> 57:31.501
I wish we weren't throwing in
the towel on Earth.

57:32.126 --> 57:36.334
I also don't like the idea of my son
having to spend half his lifetime in a ship

57:36.501 --> 57:39.292
to reach a planet
we don't even know.

57:39.417 --> 57:41.959
I don't even consider it.

57:42.167 --> 57:45.959
Marta and I would get immediately
rejected by the boarding protocol.

57:46.251 --> 57:48.126
The reproduction criteria
is crap.

57:48.292 --> 57:49.459
There you go.

57:49.667 --> 57:51.709
We're a disgusting species

57:52.626 --> 57:54.709
and we deserve the planet
we've got.

57:55.042 --> 57:57.042
But our kids don't.

58:04.876 --> 58:07.834
Everything went fine.
The ten simulators are in order.

58:07.959 --> 58:10.542
The inspection phase
was a success.

58:10.709 --> 58:14.292
I'll take care of it.
See you after the committee.

58:26.584 --> 58:27.584
Alex!

58:27.751 --> 58:29.751
Can you come for a second?

58:34.959 --> 58:37.292
- Does it hurt?
- No.

58:41.042 --> 58:42.792
It wasn't the sun this time.

58:44.501 --> 58:46.084
I'm going to call Chao.

58:47.584 --> 58:49.959
Don't worry about the prick,
you won't even feel it.

58:50.126 --> 58:52.459
Laura will take care of you,
she has hands of gold.

58:52.667 --> 58:56.417
Laura, please treat her like family.

58:56.751 --> 58:58.626
We'll see you in the office.

58:58.876 --> 59:01.292
Good. Alex, over here.

59:08.584 --> 59:10.292
<i>Then it's serious?</i>

59:10.459 --> 59:11.876
<i>No, I don't think it's serious.</i>

59:12.667 --> 59:14.834
We have to wait for the results.

59:15.667 --> 59:17.834
I just find it striking how delicate

59:17.959 --> 59:21.751
and white her epidermis is,
like she's never been in the sun.

59:22.126 --> 59:24.876
You know, computer geeks
are like vampires.

59:28.584 --> 59:29.959
Is that it?

59:31.959 --> 59:34.334
Alex, where did you get her?

01:00:26.709 --> 01:00:29.334
GENETIC ENGINEERS

to the cloning bank,

01:01:19.292 --> 01:01:20.792
a brave gesture

01:01:21.251 --> 01:01:25.042
which clearly sets us apart
from the other four cities

01:01:25.251 --> 01:01:27.667
where the Orbit program
is currently being developed.

01:01:37.084 --> 01:01:38.084
GENERALITIES CLONE ()9

01:01:41.542 --> 01:01:45.501
The biowitnesses offer us
real data

01:01:46.334 --> 01:01:48.292
<i>about the voyage's impact</i>

01:01:48.459 --> 01:01:50.042
<i>on not only the physical</i>

01:01:51.126 --> 01:01:55.251
<i>but also mental health
of our future passengers.</i>

01:01:55.417 --> 01:01:56.417
CURRENT RESIDENCE

01:01:57.626 --> 01:01:58.876
<i>This allows us</i>

01:01:59.042 --> 01:02:02.792
not only to stay ahead,
but also to prepare ourselves.

01:02:04.084 --> 01:02:05.959
<i>It's not a question of race</i>

01:02:06.709 --> 01:02:08.459
<i>or borders.</i>

01:02:08.667 --> 01:02:10.834
<i>It's not even a political issue.</i>

01:02:11.042 --> 01:02:13.959
<i>The fact is, we're a species</i>

01:02:14.126 --> 01:02:17.792
<i>peering over the edge
of its existence.</i>

01:02:18.292 --> 01:02:22.084
<i>We've obviously been unable
to protect</i>

01:02:22.251 --> 01:02:25.042
<i>and take care of the Earth's
limited resources.</i>

01:02:26.917 --> 01:02:28.251
Nevertheless,

01:02:28.959 --> 01:02:30.251
one morning

01:02:31.251 --> 01:02:37.251
planet GJ909 appeared
in half the world's telescopes.

01:02:39.792 --> 01:02:42.917
<i>At first we thought
it was unheard of,</i>

01:02:44.209 --> 01:02:47.126
but over time it has become
our only,

01:02:47.292 --> 01:02:49.042
hear me well, only...

01:02:50.042 --> 01:02:51.792
chance of survival.

01:02:54.126 --> 01:02:55.501
As you can see,

01:02:56.667 --> 01:02:58.751
<i>its existence</i>

01:02:59.167 --> 01:03:03.751
gives us the chance
to dream of a better future.

01:03:03.917 --> 01:03:06.709
And I'm not talking about us,
but our children

01:03:06.876 --> 01:03:08.417
and our grandchildren.

01:03:10.626 --> 01:03:13.459
<i>I'm talking about the chance
we have</i>

01:03:13.626 --> 01:03:15.334
<i>to start over as a species.</i>

01:03:38.667 --> 01:03:41.751
The cloning bank only works
with samples from people who died

01:03:41.917 --> 01:03:43.959
at least two generations back.

01:03:44.834 --> 01:03:46.584
Helena, you're unique.

01:03:47.751 --> 01:03:49.751
Like everyone else.

01:03:51.459 --> 01:03:53.251
No, not like everyone else.

01:03:53.626 --> 01:03:57.751
Helena, you're genetically-exact
copies of very healthy people.

01:03:58.959 --> 01:04:01.376
You're actually better
than most people.

01:04:01.834 --> 01:04:03.709
What good did that do me?

01:04:09.126 --> 01:04:10.667
I'll get some coffee.

01:04:17.667 --> 01:04:19.667
It was the engineer, wasn't it?

01:04:21.917 --> 01:04:24.292
How could you leave me
like that?

01:04:31.917 --> 01:04:33.417
Come on, pick it up.

01:04:43.459 --> 01:04:44.584
Where's the coffee?

01:04:47.084 --> 01:04:48.459
What are you doing?

01:04:53.626 --> 01:04:54.959
Dad...?

01:04:56.334 --> 01:04:58.126
She has to go back
to the simulator.

01:04:58.292 --> 01:05:00.876
I'm going to call security,
they'll be here in five minutes.

01:05:01.042 --> 01:05:02.376
No, wait.

01:05:02.542 --> 01:05:04.542
- Then we have to talk to Hugo.
- No, wait.

01:05:04.959 --> 01:05:06.501
Please, wait.

01:05:09.542 --> 01:05:10.542
Please!

01:05:14.959 --> 01:05:16.126
Helena?

01:05:23.292 --> 01:05:24.459
Helena!

01:05:48.959 --> 01:05:50.959
Go to the main road.
Get in the first taxi

01:05:51.167 --> 01:05:54.792
you find. Dad will call the program
and I won't be able to stop him.

01:05:58.876 --> 01:06:01.042
Do you think like he does?

01:06:17.334 --> 01:06:18.501
Hurry.

01:06:26.834 --> 01:06:29.167
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

01:07:17.417 --> 01:07:18.667
Are you okay?

01:07:20.376 --> 01:07:22.459
Why didn't you tell me?

01:07:25.209 --> 01:07:27.292
You went to see your parents.

01:07:32.917 --> 01:07:35.584
- Why didn't you tell me?
- We have to go, Helena.

01:07:37.834 --> 01:07:39.501
- We have to go.
- Alex!

01:07:45.084 --> 01:07:47.167
You're all I have.

01:07:49.542 --> 01:07:51.042
You lied to me.

01:07:58.709 --> 01:08:00.251
I'm sorry.

01:08:18.251 --> 01:08:20.626
Well, that's why I need help.

01:08:22.959 --> 01:08:25.042
Does Katherine know?
Of course she does.

01:08:25.209 --> 01:08:27.084
Katherine gave the order!

01:08:48.376 --> 01:08:50.084
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.

01:08:50.251 --> 01:08:51.251
<i>All right.</i>

01:08:51.376 --> 01:08:53.334
- Thanks, Silvia.
- <i>Be careful.</i>

01:08:56.292 --> 01:08:57.667
What did she say?

01:08:59.459 --> 01:09:02.542
She'll give us the key
when she leaves her job.

01:09:10.334 --> 01:09:11.959
It's worse, isn't it?

01:09:12.876 --> 01:09:14.376
A little, yes.

01:10:02.417 --> 01:10:04.959
It's very important
that you catch them.

01:10:05.126 --> 01:10:06.626
Hopefully alive,

01:10:06.917 --> 01:10:08.459
especially her.

01:10:09.959 --> 01:10:10.959
Are you okay?

01:10:14.084 --> 01:10:15.792
What if we're wrong?

01:10:17.626 --> 01:10:19.751
What about the other
nine passengers?

01:10:21.126 --> 01:10:23.751
Why should I be different
from them?

01:11:36.084 --> 01:11:37.834
Now I understand this whole mess.

01:11:38.251 --> 01:11:39.376
You're beautiful.

01:11:41.042 --> 01:11:42.209
Thanks.

01:11:43.459 --> 01:11:45.084
When my parents lived

01:11:45.251 --> 01:11:48.959
in the Isaura District it was poor,
but normal, not the mess it is now.

01:11:49.417 --> 01:11:53.126
If you don't bother anyone,
no one will bother you.

01:11:55.376 --> 01:11:58.084
I don't know how to thank you,
Silvia. Really.

01:12:03.876 --> 01:12:06.084
Probably a colleague
who forgot something.

01:12:07.084 --> 01:12:08.584
Stay here.

01:12:09.917 --> 01:12:11.667
Nobody can see you here.

01:12:20.667 --> 01:12:21.751
What are you doing?

01:12:28.584 --> 01:12:29.876
Lower your voice, ma'am.

01:12:30.042 --> 01:12:31.209
We closed over an hour ago.

01:12:31.376 --> 01:12:32.376
Shut up.

01:12:41.584 --> 01:12:42.751
Do you know him?

01:12:44.917 --> 01:12:45.917
No idea.

01:12:47.917 --> 01:12:50.876
The membership log says
he comes here often.

01:12:51.292 --> 01:12:53.667
Well, it's the first time
I've seen him.

01:12:55.084 --> 01:12:57.251
What are you doing here
at this hour?

01:12:58.292 --> 01:12:59.626
I'm doing a software check.

01:13:00.792 --> 01:13:02.592
They're selected randomly,
today it's my turn.

01:13:04.667 --> 01:13:06.834
I was leaving in five minutes.

01:13:09.209 --> 01:13:11.792
Could you show us your booth,
please?

01:13:14.917 --> 01:13:16.084
Of course.

01:13:27.459 --> 01:13:28.667
Who is that?

01:13:28.959 --> 01:13:30.334
It's Hugo.

01:13:43.167 --> 01:13:44.834
Why isn't it connected?

01:13:45.376 --> 01:13:47.584
I was closing in five minutes,
I told you.

01:13:50.501 --> 01:13:51.667
Could you turn it on, please?

01:13:52.167 --> 01:13:53.667
Don't move, don't even blink.

01:13:55.876 --> 01:13:57.084
Sure.

01:14:08.376 --> 01:14:10.417
They're default projections.

01:14:26.834 --> 01:14:27.834
They don't move?

01:14:28.876 --> 01:14:29.959
No.

01:14:41.376 --> 01:14:42.792
<i>Never?</i>

01:14:44.584 --> 01:14:45.751
Never.

01:14:53.376 --> 01:14:54.709
And like this?

01:14:57.959 --> 01:14:59.501
- Like what?
- Like this.

01:15:04.042 --> 01:15:05.292
It moved.

01:15:07.126 --> 01:15:08.959
- That one?
- Yes.

01:15:13.376 --> 01:15:14.209
Are you sure?

01:15:14.376 --> 01:15:16.376
It can't move, it's impossible.

01:15:16.542 --> 01:15:17.751
Why not, ma'am?

01:15:17.917 --> 01:15:19.834
Because the sensors are off.

01:15:19.959 --> 01:15:21.917
It's not impossible,
I saw it.

01:15:22.084 --> 01:15:25.167
It's your fucking imagination!
They can't move!

01:15:29.501 --> 01:15:30.917
Take it easy.

01:15:35.501 --> 01:15:37.126
Tell them to come out.

01:15:43.584 --> 01:15:45.751
Ma'am, tell them to come out.

01:15:59.542 --> 01:16:01.167
Son of a bitch!

01:16:01.334 --> 01:16:02.751
Son of a bitch!

01:16:02.917 --> 01:16:04.459
<i>You see?
I saw them in there!</i>

01:16:04.626 --> 01:16:06.292
Alex, let's go!

01:17:54.126 --> 01:17:55.584
Come on, we have to jump.

01:17:57.751 --> 01:17:58.751
Let's go!

01:17:58.834 --> 01:18:00.167
You go first.

01:18:00.917 --> 01:18:03.417
I need to see how you do it.
Please, go first.

01:18:10.501 --> 01:18:11.626
Come on!

01:18:12.542 --> 01:18:13.542
Come on!

01:18:31.626 --> 01:18:32.667
Don't shoot!

01:18:33.459 --> 01:18:34.834
Don't shoot!

01:18:45.126 --> 01:18:46.251
Take her to the van.

01:18:52.667 --> 01:18:54.251
We don't need him.

01:19:39.792 --> 01:19:42.584
Alex, what the hell is going on?

01:19:42.751 --> 01:19:44.709
They almost destroyed my clinic.

01:19:45.042 --> 01:19:46.084
I'm sorry.

01:19:46.751 --> 01:19:49.417
I told them I hadn't seen you,
that I didn't know her.

01:19:49.584 --> 01:19:51.685
- Why didn't you answer my calls?
- It's too dangerous.

01:19:51.709 --> 01:19:54.501
The phone could be tapped.
Don't call me again.

01:19:55.084 --> 01:19:56.709
- Did you read my message?
- Yeah.

01:19:56.876 --> 01:19:58.376
That's why I'm here.

01:19:58.584 --> 01:19:59.667
Okay.

01:20:00.709 --> 01:20:04.084
I did a biopsy of Helena's skin sample
and the results aren't good.

01:20:05.209 --> 01:20:08.126
She has a very strange mutation
in her epidermis.

01:20:08.376 --> 01:20:11.959
She's like a butterfly that can't live
outside, in this cesspool.

01:20:15.292 --> 01:20:16.834
They took her.

01:20:17.792 --> 01:20:19.084
She's not with me now.

01:20:27.376 --> 01:20:28.834
Better for her.

01:20:30.959 --> 01:20:34.126
The only place she can live
right now is in there.

01:20:34.584 --> 01:20:37.959
Her skin got used to the pressurized
environment inside the ship.

01:20:38.126 --> 01:20:39.834
You don't understand.

01:20:41.501 --> 01:20:43.542
The analytics chain is broken.

01:20:45.376 --> 01:20:47.209
I have to get her out of there.

01:20:50.334 --> 01:20:51.751
There's something else.

01:21:23.042 --> 01:21:24.709
Let me go back inside.

01:21:31.417 --> 01:21:32.251
You can't.

01:21:32.417 --> 01:21:33.167
Why not?

01:21:33.334 --> 01:21:34.167
Because you can't.

01:21:34.334 --> 01:21:35.084
Why not?

01:21:35.251 --> 01:21:37.376
Because we disconnected Orbit 9.

01:21:39.459 --> 01:21:40.959
Then connect it.

01:21:43.959 --> 01:21:46.334
That's not how things work,
Helena.

01:21:54.417 --> 01:21:56.459
I'll try to be clear.

01:22:00.542 --> 01:22:02.667
You're of no use to us
anymore.

01:22:14.251 --> 01:22:16.626
Leave Alex alone.

01:22:18.959 --> 01:22:20.292
Please.

01:22:59.042 --> 01:23:02.042
I can't leave her
outside the simulator.

01:23:02.209 --> 01:23:04.876
And now I can't put her
back in the simulator.

01:23:48.834 --> 01:23:49.834
Alex.

01:23:50.959 --> 01:23:52.667
<i>I'll offer you a deal.</i>

01:23:54.251 --> 01:23:55.376
A deal.

01:23:56.084 --> 01:23:58.501
You're offering me a deal?

01:23:58.709 --> 01:24:00.667
<i>Yes, but first I want to see Helena.</i>

01:24:01.126 --> 01:24:02.959
Stop fucking with me, damn it!

01:24:03.209 --> 01:24:05.834
You're a scientist and you fell in love
with the mouse.

01:24:05.959 --> 01:24:07.959
Do you hear how ridiculous
that sounds?

01:24:08.126 --> 01:24:11.792
<i>Hugo, if anyone has something
to gain here, it's you.</i>

01:24:50.459 --> 01:24:51.876
Will she suffer?

01:24:52.501 --> 01:24:53.751
She'll get sleepy.

01:24:53.917 --> 01:24:55.917
It's quick, one or two minutes
after we inject her.

01:24:56.959 --> 01:24:59.501
She won't even know
what's happening.

01:25:21.959 --> 01:25:23.501
Stop, you bastard!

01:25:36.584 --> 01:25:37.959
<i>Code 3 at main entrance.</i>

01:26:09.167 --> 01:26:10.542
I just talked to Hugo!

01:26:10.709 --> 01:26:12.959
<i>Beige vehicle has stopped.</i>

01:26:13.167 --> 01:26:14.376
I said stop!

01:26:14.876 --> 01:26:16.376
He's expecting me!

01:26:18.209 --> 01:26:19.292
He's expecting me!

01:26:19.459 --> 01:26:19.959
Stop!

01:26:20.126 --> 01:26:21.292
No!

01:26:21.542 --> 01:26:22.792
Lower your weapons.

01:26:22.959 --> 01:26:24.584
He's an engineer.

01:26:28.167 --> 01:26:29.167
Everyone stop!

01:26:55.709 --> 01:26:57.376
<i>Alex, you're in worse shape</i>

01:26:57.542 --> 01:26:58.751
than I thought.

01:26:58.917 --> 01:27:02.167
I'm offering you what you've wanted
your whole life.

01:27:04.334 --> 01:27:07.042
But you could be lying too.

01:27:07.876 --> 01:27:09.876
And you could shoot me.

01:27:10.834 --> 01:27:12.292
And I will.

01:27:14.459 --> 01:27:16.209
Like you did Silvia.

01:27:18.209 --> 01:27:20.626
But if I'm telling the truth,
you'll keep your word.

01:27:22.167 --> 01:27:25.126
I want to be inside that ship
with Helena.

01:28:44.292 --> 01:28:46.209
POSITIVE - 6 WEEKS
SEX - FEMALE

01:28:57.042 --> 01:28:58.917
But the board isn't here now.

01:28:59.501 --> 01:29:02.792
The only ones here
are Katherine and Hugo.

01:29:34.084 --> 01:29:35.167
Speak.

01:29:35.917 --> 01:29:37.417
I have one condition.
