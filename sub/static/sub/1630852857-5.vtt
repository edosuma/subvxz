A NETFLIX SERIES

00:43.333 --> 00:44.833
Where have you come from?

00:45.333 --> 00:46.416
What's happened?

00:46.500 --> 00:48.333
Violation of public property, madam.

00:48.416 --> 00:49.958
I was just walking in a park.

00:50.041 --> 00:52.250
And he was evading a police check.

00:52.333 --> 00:53.666
I didn't do that.

00:53.750 --> 00:55.958
You were traveling without documents.

00:56.041 --> 00:58.625
Here's his ID card.
That's what you needed, right?

01:02.125 --> 01:03.458
Okay, Mr. Pentecoste.

01:04.041 --> 01:05.208
-You can go.
-Thank you.

01:05.291 --> 01:07.666
-The fine will be sent to your home.
-Okay.

01:07.750 --> 01:08.666
Goodbye.

01:20.791 --> 01:22.000
I'm sorry, Marghe.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.291
What for? These things happen.

01:27.958 --> 01:31.791
Someone goes out, enters a park at night
to get some fresh air, and instead…

01:34.625 --> 01:36.333
he's taken in by the police.

01:40.416 --> 01:41.291
Listen.

01:42.208 --> 01:44.416
-I was in that park--
-Carlo, there…

01:45.916 --> 01:47.166
There's no need.

01:47.250 --> 01:49.500
I wouldn't want
to be asked any questions either.

01:51.583 --> 01:52.791
What does that mean?

01:53.500 --> 01:54.583
Will you look at me?

02:06.708 --> 02:07.541
Shall we go?

02:09.916 --> 02:10.916
I'm not coming.

02:11.750 --> 02:13.041
What do you mean?

02:14.666 --> 02:15.833
I can't do it.

02:19.375 --> 02:21.041
We need to talk, Marghe.

02:22.041 --> 02:24.125
-Come on, Carlo.
-Let's go home and talk.

02:24.208 --> 02:25.208
Enough!

02:26.375 --> 02:27.625
What are we doing?

02:28.958 --> 02:32.916
We are like the musicians on the Titanic
who kept on playing as the ship sinks.

02:33.416 --> 02:34.583
Come on!

02:34.666 --> 02:35.583
Marghe…

02:40.250 --> 02:41.666
Are you being serious?

03:06.875 --> 03:08.166
<i>Did you find them?</i>

03:08.250 --> 03:09.166
Yeah.

03:09.875 --> 03:11.166
I found the keys.

03:12.791 --> 03:14.125
Stay as long as you like.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.375
The gallery keeps it free for artists.
You're an artist, right?

03:18.458 --> 03:20.041
<i>Architect Verna.</i>

03:20.125 --> 03:21.083
Wow.

03:23.500 --> 03:25.166
Great place to be depressed in.

03:26.916 --> 03:27.916
Want me to join you?

03:28.000 --> 03:29.083
No.

03:29.708 --> 03:30.875
No, actually,

03:32.000 --> 03:33.458
I need some time alone.

03:33.541 --> 03:34.375
Okay.

03:35.750 --> 03:36.833
But sleep on it.

03:36.916 --> 03:39.750
<i>I think you've had enough</i>
<i>for today, haven't you?</i>

03:40.250 --> 03:41.791
<i>-I love you.</i>
-Love you, too.

03:41.875 --> 03:42.708
<i>Night.</i>

04:47.000 --> 04:47.833
Hello?

04:48.833 --> 04:50.333
One of your students saw you.

04:50.416 --> 04:52.791
Saw me doing what? What have I done?

04:52.875 --> 04:56.500
You left the party at the symposium
with Miss Casadei,

04:56.583 --> 04:59.416
who then called to say
she was leaving the course.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.666
Is it reasonable to assume
the two facts are linked,

05:01.750 --> 05:03.583
or am I jumping to conclusions?

05:04.166 --> 05:07.125
Is that a real question
or a rhetorical one?

05:07.208 --> 05:10.541
-Are you being sarcastic?
-I've never been less so in my life.

05:10.625 --> 05:14.000
You'd already made your mind up
when you relieved me of my duties.

05:14.083 --> 05:17.375
First, the "misunderstanding,"
as you defined it,

05:17.958 --> 05:19.041
and now this.

05:19.125 --> 05:21.375
Do you really think I slept with Sofia?

05:21.458 --> 05:23.625
I know you're saying her name now.

05:23.708 --> 05:26.041
Before it was "the girl" or "the student."

05:31.833 --> 05:34.583
-I didn't sleep with her.
-Professor Pentecoste.

05:34.666 --> 05:38.041
The code of ethics you signed
doesn't only refer to sex

05:38.125 --> 05:41.625
but inappropriate personal relationships
between teachers and students.

05:42.916 --> 05:45.583
Can you honestly say that there is nothing

05:45.666 --> 05:49.333
and there has never been anything
between you and Miss Casadei?

05:52.333 --> 05:53.666
Here's the Titanic.

07:24.416 --> 07:25.666
What are you doing here?

07:26.250 --> 07:28.583
I want to talk,
but you won't answer the phone.

07:29.541 --> 07:31.750
And it seemed like a good idea
to ambush me?

07:31.833 --> 07:35.166
What ambush? I wanted to understand
what happened at the university.

07:36.333 --> 07:37.666
What do you know about it?

07:38.875 --> 07:39.958
Oh, sure.

07:40.958 --> 07:43.458
The gentlemen of this city all talk.

07:44.291 --> 07:46.458
It's clear the dean wasted no time.

07:47.041 --> 07:49.250
He only called me out of consideration.

07:49.333 --> 07:50.666
What did he tell you?

07:51.208 --> 07:52.750
That I molested a student?

07:53.500 --> 07:56.041
I know you wouldn't do anything like that.

07:56.541 --> 07:58.875
Is it so hard to understand?
I'm worried about you.

07:58.958 --> 08:01.041
You're worried about the surname we share.

08:01.125 --> 08:02.250
You're ashamed.

08:02.333 --> 08:04.166
How can you think that about me?

08:04.875 --> 08:05.833
Am I wrong?

08:05.916 --> 08:10.208
Don't take your frustration out on me.
It's not my fault you got fired!

08:19.458 --> 08:20.500
Get out of here.

08:29.541 --> 08:30.791
Call me if you want.

09:05.083 --> 09:08.000
THE WAY THINGS ARE
BY SOFIA CASADEI

09:09.166 --> 09:10.375
Hi, Sofia.

09:10.458 --> 09:11.291
Hi, Sauro!

09:25.291 --> 09:26.166
Sofia!

09:26.666 --> 09:27.500
Hi, Dad.

09:28.916 --> 09:30.333
Want something to eat?

09:31.333 --> 09:32.416
I'm not hungry.

09:34.458 --> 09:38.333
I bought them at the garden center.
I think I planted them too close together.

09:38.875 --> 09:40.208
No, they're fine.

09:45.833 --> 09:47.625
I got those out of the cellar.

09:49.375 --> 09:50.208
They were Mom's.

09:54.375 --> 09:56.750
Why are you home?
Did something happen in Milan?

09:58.750 --> 09:59.583
Well?

10:02.416 --> 10:03.250
Hang on.

10:10.708 --> 10:11.541
What's that?

10:12.125 --> 10:13.125
It's for you.

10:18.375 --> 10:20.625
THE WAY THINGS ARE
BY SOFIA CASADEI

10:22.916 --> 10:25.041
<i>On the day my life changed forever,</i>

10:25.125 --> 10:27.166
<i>my mother asked me to accompany her.</i>

10:34.541 --> 10:35.958
<i>That's how she was,</i>

10:36.041 --> 10:38.083
<i>driven by unexpected decisions.</i>

10:44.833 --> 10:48.583
<i>When her mind went dark,</i>
<i>she decided to get away from everyone.</i>

10:49.208 --> 10:50.541
<i>When the light came back,</i>

10:50.625 --> 10:53.791
<i>she'd chase all the emotions</i>
<i>she'd missed in the meantime.</i>

10:57.583 --> 11:01.250
<i>That day, she wanted to take me</i>
<i>to the church she married my father in.</i>

11:02.000 --> 11:03.875
<i>She was happy with him.</i>

11:04.625 --> 11:08.583
<i>And that day, I witnessed</i>
<i>her final attempt to remember him.</i>

11:11.000 --> 11:13.166
<i>I didn't see the church that day.</i>

11:15.208 --> 11:17.583
<i>That day, my mother's attempt failed.</i>

11:21.208 --> 11:23.416
<i>She lost her grip on the memory</i>

11:24.375 --> 11:26.666
<i>and on the salvation it brought with it.</i>

12:04.875 --> 12:06.291
Sorry, I know I'm late.

12:06.375 --> 12:08.166
It's fine. Don't worry.

12:20.916 --> 12:22.000
Listen, Marghe.

12:23.250 --> 12:25.958
Some clients interested
in the Concordia apartment called.

12:26.041 --> 12:27.208
They want to view it.

12:28.750 --> 12:30.333
-When?
-Now.

12:32.166 --> 12:34.125
I'll go if it's all right with you.

12:35.458 --> 12:36.291
Okay.

12:51.458 --> 12:52.291
Eva, wait.

12:54.333 --> 12:55.291
I'll go.

13:04.166 --> 13:06.250
-Beautiful flooring.
-Yes.

13:06.333 --> 13:08.625
-Is it original graniglia?
-Late 1800s.

13:09.125 --> 13:09.958
Please.

13:11.875 --> 13:13.958
And this is the strong point
of the apartment.

13:14.458 --> 13:18.125
The bright and airy
60-square-meter living room.

13:18.208 --> 13:20.291
Yes, it's incredible. Beautiful.

13:21.041 --> 13:21.916
Please.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.083
This way.

13:25.250 --> 13:27.458
-The windows are west facing.
-West.

13:28.416 --> 13:30.041
The light is perfect here too.

13:30.125 --> 13:31.708
It all seems perfect to me.

13:31.791 --> 13:34.333
-I can already see you here.
-So can we.

13:35.125 --> 13:37.250
There is one problem.
How will we decorate it?

13:37.333 --> 13:39.750
We just have different tastes, darling.

13:39.833 --> 13:42.166
Actually, the truth is
we don't have any taste.

13:42.250 --> 13:44.583
If you like, I can give you a hand.

13:45.166 --> 13:47.291
I've already had some ideas
for this place.

13:48.750 --> 13:51.791
You always thought
Mom died in an accident.

13:54.708 --> 13:57.375
Actually, she killed herself,
and I always knew.

13:59.750 --> 14:01.625
I never knew how to tell you.

14:04.416 --> 14:06.625
There were no skid marks on the road.

14:07.750 --> 14:10.333
I never told you.
I thought it would hurt too much.

14:10.416 --> 14:11.875
I've always known too.

14:13.583 --> 14:15.708
It wasn't your mom who did what she did.

14:16.500 --> 14:17.791
It was her illness.

14:20.666 --> 14:22.416
It's good that you wrote about it.

14:23.875 --> 14:25.458
It's good for both of us.

14:27.208 --> 14:31.083
And you said it in the best way.
Your story is beautiful. You know that?

14:32.291 --> 14:34.291
-You're just saying that.
-No!

14:35.291 --> 14:39.166
I don't know much about literature,
but I do know one thing.

14:39.875 --> 14:41.750
It took a lot of courage to write it.

14:42.250 --> 14:44.333
That courage can be felt in every word.

14:46.125 --> 14:49.083
I could never have done it alone.
Someone helped me.

14:50.541 --> 14:51.500
Who?

14:51.583 --> 14:52.458
A man.

14:53.125 --> 14:54.250
My teacher.

14:55.666 --> 14:56.666
"A man"?

14:58.166 --> 15:00.458
He got anything to do
with you coming back?

15:02.125 --> 15:03.541
Yes, maybe.

15:06.916 --> 15:07.833
Okay.

15:09.500 --> 15:12.375
Let's see how it could have gone, then.

15:15.291 --> 15:19.333
Well, you have my contact details.
Call me if you need anything.

15:20.791 --> 15:21.625
Go on.

15:22.125 --> 15:24.208
-We'll take it!
-Great!

15:24.291 --> 15:25.458
I'm so happy.

15:25.541 --> 15:26.958
How do we make the offer?

15:27.041 --> 15:29.875
I can have the office call you
to arrange an appointment.

15:29.958 --> 15:31.750
-Okay, perfect.
-Perfect.

15:32.333 --> 15:33.541
Can we give you a ride?

15:33.625 --> 15:35.458
No, thank you. It's not far.

15:35.541 --> 15:38.000
-All right. Goodbye.
-Thanks for everything!

15:38.083 --> 15:39.500
-See you soon.
-Goodbye.

15:57.625 --> 15:59.791
FOR RENT
COMMERCIAL PROPERTY

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
I should have left
when his wife came to talk to me.

16:15.500 --> 16:17.708
I was convinced
that everything would get sorted,

16:17.791 --> 16:19.250
but it was impossible to go back

16:19.333 --> 16:22.250
to just being his student
and him my teacher.

16:25.583 --> 16:27.000
Anyway, it's over now.

16:27.625 --> 16:28.666
Are you sure?

16:29.833 --> 16:30.750
Yes.

16:31.333 --> 16:33.916
So who's at the doorstep?

16:59.083 --> 17:00.833
How did you find out where I lived?

17:02.250 --> 17:03.916
You're good at describing places.

17:05.875 --> 17:07.000
And not only places.

17:12.041 --> 17:13.875
See? You found your true voice.

17:15.833 --> 17:18.583
Your story is one of the best things
I've read in years.

17:20.333 --> 17:22.791
And you came all this way to tell me that?

17:25.416 --> 17:26.250
Yes.

17:28.583 --> 17:29.833
You could've called.

17:31.625 --> 17:32.708
I could have, yes.

17:34.458 --> 17:35.958
But I wanted to find you.

17:36.916 --> 17:38.583
You'd already found me,

17:39.625 --> 17:41.000
but you sent me away.

17:51.083 --> 17:52.250
What do you want?

19:45.333 --> 19:46.541
<i>I need to apologize.</i>

19:47.041 --> 19:47.875
<i>What for?</i>

19:47.958 --> 19:51.750
For making everyone believe
there was never anything between us.

19:55.375 --> 19:56.375
The dean.

19:57.416 --> 19:58.416
My wife.

20:00.125 --> 20:01.166
Myself.

20:04.541 --> 20:07.125
I wanted to convince everyone
it was the truth.

20:10.375 --> 20:11.375
But the truth…

20:13.208 --> 20:15.291
is that I've always wanted you.

20:23.000 --> 20:27.333
And now that desire doesn't seem so wrong.

20:42.500 --> 20:44.000
Is this your favorite Chinese place?

20:44.500 --> 20:45.708
It's good, isn't it?

20:48.791 --> 20:50.000
You don't cook.

20:51.208 --> 20:52.416
Do I look like I do?

20:53.625 --> 20:55.166
It's not an insult!

20:57.583 --> 20:58.958
Who are you?

21:01.291 --> 21:02.541
I know nothing about you.

21:03.875 --> 21:04.791
Are you someone

21:05.291 --> 21:08.208
who fixes bodies by day
and punches them by night?

21:08.291 --> 21:10.041
Do you need to know more?

21:10.833 --> 21:12.125
I don't know. Do I?

21:13.791 --> 21:15.000
You took care of me.

21:16.041 --> 21:17.708
Nobody's ever done that before.

21:18.916 --> 21:20.416
That's what you need to know.

21:58.750 --> 22:00.041
I'LL CALL YOU LATER!
M.

22:40.666 --> 22:41.500
Hey.

22:41.583 --> 22:43.791
Hey! What's going on?

22:43.875 --> 22:46.000
What do you mean?
What's going on with you?

22:46.500 --> 22:48.708
Dad told me about the job. How are you?

22:48.791 --> 22:50.000
Marghe left me.

22:50.916 --> 22:51.875
<i>What?</i>

22:53.958 --> 22:54.875
She left.

22:56.916 --> 22:59.083
Shall I come over so we can talk?

22:59.166 --> 23:00.125
No.

23:00.916 --> 23:02.166
I'm not home.

23:03.125 --> 23:04.166
<i>Where are you?</i>

23:05.500 --> 23:06.333
In Rimini.

23:06.416 --> 23:08.291
Why the fuck are you in Rimini?

23:09.625 --> 23:10.916
<i>With the student?</i>

23:12.416 --> 23:15.166
That's it. Well done.
It's better not to say anything.

23:15.250 --> 23:17.250
<i>Don't make the situation worse.</i>

23:17.791 --> 23:20.000
<i>-Call me when you get back.</i>
-Okay.

23:32.166 --> 23:33.333
Good morning.

23:34.708 --> 23:35.666
Good morning.

23:38.583 --> 23:39.666
Breakfast?

23:39.750 --> 23:40.958
Yes.

23:44.541 --> 23:45.583
One moment!

23:47.250 --> 23:48.500
Just a moment!

23:52.666 --> 23:53.916
-Who is it?
-Me.

23:56.500 --> 23:57.791
There you are.

23:58.541 --> 24:00.041
Why don't you come in?

24:03.958 --> 24:05.208
Who told you I was here?

24:05.291 --> 24:08.708
I have your friends' numbers too.
And since you're unreachable…

24:09.208 --> 24:10.500
What is this place?

24:10.583 --> 24:12.500
It's Giulia's, where the artists stay.

24:12.583 --> 24:14.833
Listen, why did you leave home?

24:14.916 --> 24:16.833
What do you want to do? Leave Carlo?

24:16.916 --> 24:19.791
-I don't want to talk, Mom.
-No, let's talk.

24:19.875 --> 24:22.375
Margherita? Why don't you want to tell me?

24:22.458 --> 24:24.250
What happened that was so bad?

24:25.541 --> 24:27.125
I fucked someone else.

24:27.708 --> 24:29.625
-Who?
-What does that matter?

24:30.166 --> 24:32.250
-But when?
-Oh God, Mom!

24:34.625 --> 24:36.041
Margherita…

24:38.291 --> 24:40.333
What were you thinking?

24:42.125 --> 24:43.041
I don't know.

24:44.666 --> 24:45.625
Nothing.

24:46.208 --> 24:49.250
For once, nothing. I wasn't thinking.

24:49.333 --> 24:50.791
I followed my instincts.

24:50.875 --> 24:53.375
I did what I wanted to,
and it happened. That's it.

24:55.875 --> 24:56.833
And I liked it.

25:03.541 --> 25:05.041
Margherita, listen.

25:05.125 --> 25:06.375
I get that.

25:07.833 --> 25:10.291
Every marriage has its crises.

25:11.208 --> 25:14.166
But it's important to think straight now.

25:14.250 --> 25:16.791
-You have to call Carlo--
-Be like you. Right?

25:18.208 --> 25:19.958
Be faithful to your husband? Yes.

25:20.041 --> 25:23.291
No, be faithful to the marriage
even if he cheats.

25:23.375 --> 25:24.458
So Carlo cheated!

25:24.541 --> 25:27.208
I'm talking about Dad, not Carlo!

25:31.375 --> 25:32.250
What do you mean?

25:33.166 --> 25:35.666
-Nothing.
-No. Tell me.

25:39.666 --> 25:42.208
Dad had an affair.

25:44.833 --> 25:46.083
It went on for years.

25:50.333 --> 25:52.041
What are you talking about?

25:52.125 --> 25:53.250
Mom, it's true.

25:54.833 --> 25:57.458
I found some postcards from a Clara.

26:11.541 --> 26:12.500
I'm sorry.

26:15.708 --> 26:17.916
I'd really like to see these postcards.

26:20.250 --> 26:21.083
Yes.

26:21.875 --> 26:24.333
After a lifetime of turning a blind eye…

26:25.208 --> 26:26.541
Sorry, you knew?

26:30.583 --> 26:32.750
It was a different time, Margherita.

26:34.291 --> 26:37.708
I didn't have the same freedom like you
to end a marriage.

26:38.791 --> 26:40.166
You can choose.

26:40.875 --> 26:44.708
But what you can't do
is say that things happen and that's it,

26:44.791 --> 26:46.541
because you make them happen!

26:50.416 --> 26:52.250
These donuts are the best.

26:54.125 --> 26:56.291
-Bursting with cream.
-I can see that.

27:00.583 --> 27:02.541
Do you always wear that bracelet?

27:04.333 --> 27:05.500
It was my mother's.

27:06.250 --> 27:08.833
I thought I'd lost it. I was really upset.

27:12.208 --> 27:15.458
Then it just reappeared
in my backpack, as if by magic.

27:15.541 --> 27:16.583
"As if by magic"?

27:16.666 --> 27:18.458
There's no other explanation.

27:26.208 --> 27:27.833
Need to tell me something?

27:28.416 --> 27:29.916
I'm going back to Milan later.

27:32.000 --> 27:32.833
Okay.

27:45.791 --> 27:46.666
Carlo?

28:22.875 --> 28:25.750
Teaching has always been
the most convenient solution.

28:26.500 --> 28:29.791
It kept me close to writing
and helped me pay my rent.

28:30.958 --> 28:32.875
Now I'll have to find something else.

28:34.250 --> 28:36.916
-Another thing that I ruined.
-No.

28:38.416 --> 28:41.291
If I'm losing everything,
I alone am responsible.

28:42.208 --> 28:43.708
You aren't losing everything.

28:44.333 --> 28:45.500
You have your story.

28:46.083 --> 28:47.125
The novel.

28:48.958 --> 28:50.166
Where are you with it?

28:52.666 --> 28:53.875
I just need the ending.

29:10.250 --> 29:13.083
DECORATING IDEAS
FOR CONCORDIA APARTMENT

29:23.916 --> 29:27.958
MARGHERITA
I MISS YOU…

29:32.875 --> 29:38.166
CAN WE MEET UP TOMORROW?

29:38.250 --> 29:41.375
So do you think the two laps
we've done are enough?

29:41.458 --> 29:43.333
Tradition says to go around
the lighthouse twice,

29:43.416 --> 29:44.583
but at your own risk.

29:44.666 --> 29:46.416
Well, if tradition says so…

29:55.541 --> 29:57.125
You have to write your ending.

30:03.250 --> 30:04.125
Go.

30:05.208 --> 30:06.250
Have a good trip.

31:40.791 --> 31:43.250
Maybe it'd be better
if we went to the restaurant?

31:45.416 --> 31:47.166
It doesn't really look great.

31:52.333 --> 31:54.625
You've already done something great.

31:57.750 --> 31:58.625
What?

32:02.583 --> 32:03.916
You helped me be reborn.

32:07.833 --> 32:08.916
But?

32:10.416 --> 32:11.791
There is a but, right?

32:11.875 --> 32:13.625
For years…

32:15.666 --> 32:17.333
I've felt like I'm standing still.

32:18.791 --> 32:21.916
And now, all of a sudden,
everything's changing.

32:24.083 --> 32:25.625
I can't do anything about it.

32:26.958 --> 32:29.041
I have to just accept it and move on.

32:32.583 --> 32:33.583
Without me.

32:34.791 --> 32:35.750
With you.

32:37.125 --> 32:38.000
But...

32:39.000 --> 32:41.083
to keep on sleeping together
would be a way

32:42.250 --> 32:43.708
to ruin a good thing.

33:50.375 --> 33:51.333
Thank you.

33:55.583 --> 33:56.583
What was that?

33:57.250 --> 33:58.750
You look so beautiful today.

34:02.958 --> 34:03.875
I'll head off.

35:03.791 --> 35:04.750
ONE MAN, ONE WOMAN

35:28.708 --> 35:30.666
PERMANENTLY DELETE FILE?
YES - NO

36:08.125 --> 36:08.958
YES

39:05.375 --> 39:10.375
