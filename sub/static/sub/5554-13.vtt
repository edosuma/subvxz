WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:03.367
(insects trilling)

00:06.238 --> 00:07.637
Perimeter clear.

00:07.639 --> 00:10.172
Another 50 meters,
then we RTB until order...

00:10.174 --> 00:12.174
Son of a bitch!

00:12.176 --> 00:14.442
(automatic gunfire)
Move!

00:14.444 --> 00:16.310
(indistinct shouting)

00:16.312 --> 00:19.379
There's a structure
ten meters east!

00:19.381 --> 00:21.414
We hit 'em hard
for a three-count,

00:21.416 --> 00:22.381
then Oscar Mike!

00:22.383 --> 00:24.449
Now!

00:27.420 --> 00:28.185
Go, go!

00:28.187 --> 00:29.753
(gunfire continues)

00:35.727 --> 00:38.260
Captain, our intel said
this quadrant was vacant.

00:38.262 --> 00:40.428
Yeah, well, we're looking at

00:40.430 --> 00:42.129
at least 12 well-armed
unfriendlies,

00:42.131 --> 00:43.430
so I'd say our intel was wrong.

00:43.432 --> 00:45.331
Situation's pear-shaped.

00:45.333 --> 00:46.432
MAN:
Ready?

00:46.434 --> 00:48.367
(continues indistinctly)

00:50.337 --> 00:53.037
This is Special Forces
Captain Cody Decker!

00:53.039 --> 00:55.372
My detachment's pinned down
at a rock formation

00:55.374 --> 00:57.140
50 yards from our truck.

00:58.676 --> 01:00.509
(upbeat music plays)

01:04.481 --> 01:06.280
You sure you know
what you're doing?

01:06.282 --> 01:08.615
I am a hypochondriac.

01:08.617 --> 01:10.717
I've been taking my own blood
pressure since I was nine.

01:10.719 --> 01:12.518
WALTER:
Why is Sylvester

01:12.520 --> 01:14.186
administering you medical care?

01:14.188 --> 01:15.787
My doctor says
my numbers are up.

01:15.789 --> 01:16.821
He wants me to check it
every morning.

01:16.823 --> 01:18.522
You're in good shape.

01:18.524 --> 01:19.356
Why would you have
high blood pressure?

01:19.358 --> 01:21.191
Happy New Year!

01:21.193 --> 01:22.725
I got bagels!

01:24.328 --> 01:25.727
You were saying?

01:25.729 --> 01:28.429
One egg for Ralphy-boy...

01:28.431 --> 01:30.664
A sesame for Happy...

01:36.437 --> 01:37.402
It's all right.

01:38.505 --> 01:40.137
It's just an accident.

01:40.139 --> 01:42.272
Who are you? What have you done
with Unhappy Quinn?

01:42.274 --> 01:44.574
Saying "yes"
to offers of kindness

01:44.576 --> 01:46.475
is easier than saying
"no, thank you."

01:46.477 --> 01:47.742
One-third the
syllables,

01:47.744 --> 01:49.376
but twice as positive.

01:49.378 --> 01:50.343
Where have I heard
that before?

01:50.345 --> 01:52.511
It's Quincy Berkstead!

01:52.513 --> 01:54.379
The man who stole
your fiancÃ©e?

01:54.381 --> 01:55.446
My nemesis.

01:55.448 --> 01:56.647
(clears throat)

01:58.617 --> 01:59.682
What?

02:03.487 --> 02:06.321
<i> Your Essential Strategies</i>
<i> for Saying Yes to Life.</i>

02:06.323 --> 02:08.289
Why are you reading
this snake oil?

02:08.291 --> 02:10.491
I am just trying
something new for New Year's.

02:10.493 --> 02:12.826
Be a bit more positive,
a little less...

02:12.828 --> 02:14.594
mean and sarcastic.

02:14.596 --> 02:16.495
The only thing dumber
than Quincy Berkstead

02:16.497 --> 02:18.463
is a New Year's resolution
based on his drivel.

02:18.465 --> 02:20.665
Resolutions are a chopportunity.

02:22.235 --> 02:24.401
A "challenging opportunity"?

02:24.403 --> 02:27.170
One: please do not quote
that quack to me.

02:27.172 --> 02:28.504
And two: resolutions don't work.

02:28.506 --> 02:31.507
Do, too; you just got
to have willpower.

02:31.509 --> 02:32.474
Oh, really?

02:32.476 --> 02:34.609
Give up the rocket fuel.

02:34.611 --> 02:36.477
You must drink, like,
12 mugs a day.

02:36.479 --> 02:39.513
I survived Camp
Lejeune boot camp.

02:39.515 --> 02:41.414
You don't think
I can kick coffee?

02:41.416 --> 02:42.548
Break from caffeine

02:42.550 --> 02:43.549
might help
with the blood pressure.

02:43.551 --> 02:45.384
So would a break
from this place.

02:45.386 --> 02:46.885
50 bucks you can't go one day.

02:54.827 --> 02:56.359
Actually, defined
start and end times

02:56.361 --> 02:58.527
for goals demand
efficiency.

02:58.529 --> 03:00.395
For example,
Megan told me to "open up"

03:00.397 --> 03:02.797
and to not be afraid
of relationships,

03:02.799 --> 03:06.400
so this year I have resolved
to be more social.

03:06.402 --> 03:07.567
That's great.
Proud of you.

03:07.569 --> 03:09.869
And research uncovered
an Armenian family

03:09.871 --> 03:11.437
that is incredibly effective

03:11.439 --> 03:13.572
at social media,
very popular online,

03:13.574 --> 03:17.375
though they, they do show
their buttocks quite often.

03:17.377 --> 03:19.143
Those are the Kardashians.

03:19.145 --> 03:21.478
Stars of social media
aren't "social."

03:21.480 --> 03:23.513
They're not actually friends
with their followers.

03:23.515 --> 03:25.065
Oh, no, on the contrary.

03:25.066 --> 03:26.616
Online, the word "friend"
is used as a verb.

03:26.618 --> 03:28.484
Um, my analysis shows

03:28.486 --> 03:30.452
videos of animals
engaged in human activity

03:30.454 --> 03:33.254
perform quite well.

03:33.256 --> 03:35.222
Especially when
set to music.

03:35.224 --> 03:36.456
I tested my theory.

03:36.458 --> 03:38.391
(tinny music playing)

03:38.392 --> 03:40.325
WALTER (deadpan):
I am a ferret making a meal.

03:40.328 --> 03:42.461
Is that my dollhouse furniture?

03:42.463 --> 03:44.296
This isn't how you make friends.

03:44.298 --> 03:46.114
It's how you
lose friends.

03:46.115 --> 03:47.931
Well, I ha-- I have 17,000 likes
in ten hours.

03:47.934 --> 03:49.333
PAIGE:
Socialization is

03:49.335 --> 03:52.369
going out and meeting
actual human beings.

03:52.371 --> 03:54.604
Like Ralph's doing
with Forestry Braves.

03:54.606 --> 03:56.305
I just like mineralogy.

03:56.307 --> 03:58.373
O-Okay, but there's also
being outside

03:58.375 --> 04:00.241
and singing songs,
tying knots...

04:00.243 --> 04:02.375
About that...

04:05.346 --> 04:08.714
I'm happy to go with Ralph
to his campout next week

04:08.716 --> 04:10.282
and I will help him practice
for his merit badges,

04:10.284 --> 04:11.716
but I draw the line
at knot-tying.

04:11.718 --> 04:13.217
Why?

04:13.219 --> 04:14.851
It's old technology

04:14.853 --> 04:17.186
that has been replaced
with clips and Velcro.

04:17.188 --> 04:19.388
It's not efficient.

04:19.390 --> 04:20.722
And no campfire songs.

04:20.724 --> 04:22.457
Instead of inviting
another kid to this thing,

04:22.459 --> 04:23.925
he invited you,

04:23.927 --> 04:26.294
a 32-year-old man,

04:26.296 --> 04:27.579
and that is so sad.

04:27.580 --> 04:28.863
So you'll sing the songs
and eat the s'mores.

04:28.865 --> 04:30.731
I need Ralph
making friends there.

04:30.733 --> 04:32.432
He's not
a natural at it.

04:32.434 --> 04:34.534
I always wish
I'd given him a sibling.

04:34.536 --> 04:36.502
A single mom to two kids?

04:36.504 --> 04:37.636
Sure, that would've
fixed everything.

04:37.638 --> 04:39.304
I just feel guilty.

04:39.306 --> 04:41.372
And a sibling would've maybe
taught him to fit in better.

04:41.374 --> 04:43.240
So just help him
be a normal kid

04:43.242 --> 04:44.307
and tie the damn knots.

04:44.309 --> 04:45.908
Deputy Cooper.
New Year's bagel?

04:45.910 --> 04:47.309
No, thank you.

04:47.311 --> 04:48.543
Easier to say "yes."

04:48.545 --> 04:49.744
After the case we just caught,

04:49.746 --> 04:51.278
I don't have
much of an appetite.

04:52.681 --> 04:54.614
Pentagon's lost contact
with one of its

04:54.616 --> 04:56.949
low geosynchronous orbit
satellites.

04:56.951 --> 04:58.951
It controls
military drones

04:58.953 --> 05:00.686
used to support
military missions.

05:00.688 --> 05:02.387
And we need it fixed ASAP.

05:02.389 --> 05:03.488
Why so urgent?

05:03.490 --> 05:06.324
Because of this.

05:06.326 --> 05:08.759
(gunfire)

05:08.761 --> 05:10.927
This is Special Forces
Captain Cody Decker!

05:10.929 --> 05:13.496
My detachment's pinned down
at a rock formation

05:13.498 --> 05:14.797
50 yards from our truck.

05:14.799 --> 05:17.866
Estimate outnumbered
12 to four.

05:17.868 --> 05:19.767
Limited ammo,
cannot disengage safely.

05:19.769 --> 05:22.302
Sun just went down,
but by daybreak

05:22.304 --> 05:24.337
our small numbers
will be exposed

05:24.339 --> 05:25.471
and we will be neutralized.

05:25.473 --> 05:27.239
Request immediate support!

05:27.241 --> 05:28.640
COOPER:
We received this

05:28.642 --> 05:31.242
30 minutes ago,
but the feed is unreliable.

05:31.244 --> 05:33.010
Special Forces,
small detachment,

05:33.012 --> 05:34.878
recent sunset.

05:34.880 --> 05:35.879
Darfur?

05:35.881 --> 05:37.247
Correct.

05:37.249 --> 05:38.681
We sent a four-man strike team

05:38.683 --> 05:40.849
to take out
a genocidal warlord

05:40.851 --> 05:41.950
who's been
eviscerating

05:41.952 --> 05:43.685
border-town farming villages.

05:43.687 --> 05:45.353
So you need your geniuses

05:45.355 --> 05:47.021
to code a patch that'll
reconnect the satellite

05:47.023 --> 05:48.322
so you can send in drones

05:48.324 --> 05:49.840
to give cover
to Decker and his men.

05:49.841 --> 05:51.357
So they can make their way
back to their vehicle

05:51.360 --> 05:53.326
equipped with repeat-fire
grenade launchers,

05:53.328 --> 05:55.294
blow out of there.

05:55.296 --> 05:56.428
PAIGE: Why not send
a plane instead?

05:56.430 --> 05:58.329
Assume it's
a top secret operation

05:58.331 --> 05:59.997
without congressional
approval...

05:59.999 --> 06:01.865
we can't send war planes if
we're not supposed to be there.

06:01.867 --> 06:03.933
Do you guys even read
the Constitution anymore?

06:03.935 --> 06:06.402
SYLVESTER: The drone's satellite
is on a polarcentric orbit.

06:06.404 --> 06:08.670
Should be over
Antarctica in 12 hours.

06:08.672 --> 06:10.304
And that is
important why?

06:10.306 --> 06:12.306
Well, the atmosphere
is thinnest at the poles.

06:12.308 --> 06:14.875
Makes it easier for the signals
to get to the satellite.

06:14.877 --> 06:17.744
U.S. research facility McMurdo
is stationed in Antarctica.

06:17.746 --> 06:18.978
But it's in a valley,

06:18.980 --> 06:20.830
so its wireless
connectivity isn't ideal.

06:20.831 --> 06:22.681
But if we can get to one of
its remote testing labs...

06:22.683 --> 06:25.050
Set up shop,
reconnect the signal;

06:25.052 --> 06:27.485
you send the drones,
soldiers live.

06:27.487 --> 06:28.586
PAIGE:
Why send us

06:28.588 --> 06:29.853
if McMurdo's got scientists?

06:29.855 --> 06:30.854
TOBY:
They're geologists.

06:30.856 --> 06:31.855
They know mineral bed-loads,

06:31.857 --> 06:32.956
not capacity downloads.

06:32.958 --> 06:34.857
Oy! Wordplay.

06:34.859 --> 06:36.892
Okay, so if we leave
now for the South Pole,

06:36.894 --> 06:39.094
we can get there
by 10:00 p.m.

06:39.095 --> 06:41.295
That gives us 51 minutes
until the sun rises in Darfur,

06:41.298 --> 06:43.364
exposing Captain Decker
to certain death.

06:43.366 --> 06:44.965
I'll make the calls. WALTER:
Okay, guys, pack up.

06:44.967 --> 06:47.033
Oh, Sly, you're gonna
have to stay here.

06:47.035 --> 06:49.535
Track the satellite and
feed us its coordinates.

06:49.537 --> 06:50.769
Copy that.

06:52.372 --> 06:54.205
It's gonna be cold there.

06:54.206 --> 06:56.039
That doesn't look
like hot cocoa.

07:00.379 --> 07:03.046
âª âª

07:03.048 --> 07:04.047
(wind howling)

07:04.049 --> 07:05.615
PILOT:
<i> Storm came up</i>

07:05.617 --> 07:07.316
from out of nowhere
and it's getting bigger soon!

07:07.318 --> 07:09.451
They're saying it's gonna rage
for about an hour,

07:09.453 --> 07:10.885
so whatever you do,
don't leave the hut.

07:10.887 --> 07:13.053
A whiteout will disorient
you in seconds.

07:13.055 --> 07:14.421
You could be two feet
away from somebody

07:14.423 --> 07:15.889
and not even see 'em.

07:15.890 --> 07:17.356
Walk in the wrong direction
a few steps

07:17.359 --> 07:18.791
and you're lost for good.

07:18.793 --> 07:21.426
And at -40, you freeze to death.

07:21.428 --> 07:22.427
Sounds great.

07:22.429 --> 07:24.061
Excited to be here.

07:24.063 --> 07:25.896
Time's a-wasting,
let's move!

07:25.898 --> 07:29.499
âª âª

07:29.501 --> 07:31.501
(wind howling)

07:43.380 --> 07:44.512
Okay, everybody.

07:44.514 --> 07:45.779
Comms in.

07:45.781 --> 07:47.480
I'm gonna connect us
to the garage.

07:50.084 --> 07:52.017
TOBY: I don't know
about you guys,

07:52.019 --> 07:53.084
but since I got here,
kind of feel like

07:53.086 --> 07:54.952
my whole world's upside-down.

07:56.755 --> 07:59.122
Oh, the yes girl is saying no
to my South Pole humor?

08:03.061 --> 08:05.094
I think my laptop's got a bug;

08:05.096 --> 08:07.596
my screen's been frozen
since we landed.

08:07.598 --> 08:08.997
Frozen, get it?

08:10.433 --> 08:13.367
I will bury you
in the ice.

08:13.369 --> 08:15.802
Caffeine withdrawal
makes you mean.

08:15.804 --> 08:17.103
Okay, Sylvester,
can you hear me? Comms are up

08:17.105 --> 08:19.371
and I just remote-desktopped
into your laptop.

08:19.373 --> 08:20.572
Yes, I can hear you.

08:20.574 --> 08:22.507
And, sadly,
Toby's lame jokes.

08:30.149 --> 08:32.482
Okay. The antenna's in position.

08:32.484 --> 08:33.883
Okay, we're ready to send

08:33.885 --> 08:35.451
my software patch
up to the satellite.

08:35.453 --> 08:36.969
What's the status on its orbit?

08:36.970 --> 08:38.486
It's above the South Pole, well
within the zone of connectivity.

08:38.489 --> 08:40.856
You are at eight of ten
signal strength.

08:40.858 --> 08:43.158
The satellite should
be back up and running

08:43.160 --> 08:45.393
once it picks up the patch.
20 seconds, tops.

08:45.395 --> 08:47.128
12-hour flight
for a two-minute job.

08:47.130 --> 08:49.430
(wind gusting)

08:51.734 --> 08:53.834
Blow me down,
that was a big one.

08:53.836 --> 08:56.703
I think this storm's picking up
faster than the pilot predicted.

08:56.705 --> 08:58.604
(wind gusting)

09:01.408 --> 09:02.540
Forget about that storm
picking up;

09:02.541 --> 09:03.673
I'm worried about
this hut picking up.

09:03.676 --> 09:05.075
These things are built

09:05.077 --> 09:06.409
to withstand
these weather fronts.

09:06.411 --> 09:08.944
Okay, Sly,
I'm turning on the antenna.

09:09.913 --> 09:11.579
Sending up the patch on three.

09:11.581 --> 09:14.582
One... two... three.

09:15.818 --> 09:17.150
You send the patch?

09:17.152 --> 09:18.151
I got nothing over here.

09:18.152 --> 09:19.151
This have something
to do with it?

09:20.755 --> 09:22.654
Oh, man, the signal crashed.

09:22.656 --> 09:24.022
Okay, I'll reposition
the antenna.

09:24.024 --> 09:26.457
(wind gusting)

09:33.532 --> 09:35.131
The antenna's not the problem.

09:35.133 --> 09:36.966
The storm's interfering
with the reception.

09:36.968 --> 09:38.468
Well, that's gonna
be an issue,

09:38.469 --> 09:39.969
because you need at least
a five signal strength

09:39.971 --> 09:41.537
to get that software
up to the satellite.

09:41.539 --> 09:44.139
The pilot said the storm
could last an hour.

09:44.141 --> 09:46.040
Walter, Decker and his team
don't have an hour.

09:46.042 --> 09:48.442
Sunrise is in about 45 minutes
and then they're toast.

09:48.444 --> 09:50.177
Okay, give me a minute.

09:52.781 --> 09:55.548
I got it.
I got it.

09:57.518 --> 09:58.984
Walter, you thinking what
I think you're thinking?

09:58.986 --> 10:00.819
Only if you think
that I'm thinking

10:00.820 --> 10:02.653
that this map shows
an elevated ridge 90 meters away

10:02.656 --> 10:04.522
from the antenna that will
send a stronger signal.

10:04.524 --> 10:06.724
Remember what the helicopter man
said about going outside?

10:06.726 --> 10:08.058
Not to. He said not to.

10:08.060 --> 10:10.894
There are four brave men
out there, counting on us.

10:10.896 --> 10:12.629
And no one else to help.

10:12.631 --> 10:14.764
I'm aware of the stakes
and I want to save them,

10:14.766 --> 10:16.699
but like the song says:
baby, it's cold outside.

10:16.701 --> 10:17.933
Let's do it.

10:17.935 --> 10:19.268
It's all about "yes."

10:19.269 --> 10:20.602
Oh, really?
You want to make out?

10:21.638 --> 10:23.037
Guys, focus.
We're about to head back

10:23.039 --> 10:24.972
into subfreezing temperatures.

10:24.974 --> 10:26.740
Now, Toby, how do we
prepare physically?

10:26.742 --> 10:27.974
Okay, if we're gonna do this,

10:27.976 --> 10:29.108
we should each eat
a protein bar,

10:29.110 --> 10:30.809
'cause staying warm
burns calories

10:30.811 --> 10:32.110
and we'll be
expending energy

10:32.112 --> 10:33.478
trudging through
all that snow.

10:33.480 --> 10:36.180
All right,
you heard the man, chow down.

10:36.182 --> 10:38.649
And I'll be tying a rope
around each of our waists

10:38.651 --> 10:41.151
with 15 feet in between,
so we can't get separated.

10:41.153 --> 10:42.986
Now, we're in
the South Pole,

10:42.988 --> 10:44.153
so compasses don't work,

10:44.155 --> 10:45.487
so we'll have to rely on

10:45.489 --> 10:47.655
old-school
navigation techniques.

10:47.657 --> 10:50.190
Forestry Brave Ralph,
any thoughts on the matter?

10:50.192 --> 10:51.124
Count your steps
and leave a trail

10:51.126 --> 10:52.591
to find your way back to base.

10:56.163 --> 10:59.497
300-foot cable
should do the trick.

11:01.100 --> 11:02.699
We ready?

11:06.037 --> 11:07.937
Guys, Doppler radar says

11:07.938 --> 11:09.838
you are walking out
into essentially a blizzard.

11:11.074 --> 11:13.774
Wow, what a great chopportunity.

11:38.767 --> 11:40.833
âª âª

11:54.081 --> 11:56.581
This is slower going
than I thought, Paige.

11:56.583 --> 11:57.582
Time check?

11:57.584 --> 11:58.883
38 minutes.

11:58.885 --> 12:00.885
TOBY: I had an Aunt Edie
when I was little.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.920
300 pounds.

12:02.922 --> 12:04.955
Hugged me so tight;
it was just like this.

12:04.957 --> 12:07.123
Couldn't see a thing
and felt like you were dying.

12:07.125 --> 12:08.891
My toes are getting numb!

12:08.893 --> 12:11.093
You're small;
you have less insulation.

12:11.095 --> 12:12.861
You'll feel it before we do.

12:12.863 --> 12:14.329
Hey, Walter!

12:14.331 --> 12:15.730
Shouldn't we be there yet?

12:15.732 --> 12:17.965
We should,
but it's all estimation.

12:17.967 --> 12:19.733
We're working blind here.

12:19.735 --> 12:21.768
Sly, I've counted 90 meters.

12:21.770 --> 12:23.069
How much further?

12:23.071 --> 12:24.737
I can barely hear you,

12:24.739 --> 12:26.805
but I think you asked
for a distance check?

12:26.807 --> 12:28.640
In 20 to 30 paces,

12:28.642 --> 12:30.308
you will come
to a small rock outcrop

12:30.310 --> 12:31.809
where you can set up
the antenna.

12:33.779 --> 12:34.944
(grunts)

12:34.946 --> 12:37.046
Hey, Cabe, are you okay?

12:37.048 --> 12:38.714
Yeah, I can handle it!

12:38.716 --> 12:40.199
I'm not sure I can.

12:40.200 --> 12:41.683
I don't think I have
20 paces left in me.

12:41.685 --> 12:43.618
Oh, you don't have to. Look!

12:43.620 --> 12:44.919
HAPPY:
Look where?

12:44.921 --> 12:46.270
I can't see you,

12:46.271 --> 12:47.620
and you're ten feet
in front of me.

12:47.623 --> 12:48.822
Cabe, do you see it?

12:48.824 --> 12:49.823
Barely!

12:49.825 --> 12:52.091
Just a few more steps, guys!

12:52.093 --> 12:53.992
You get that signal
up to the satellite,

12:53.994 --> 12:56.694
the drones get sent to Decker,
and we've got time to spare.

12:56.696 --> 12:58.996
HAPPY:
Okay, let's get this antenna up.

12:58.998 --> 13:00.263
We're gonna pull this off.

13:01.366 --> 13:04.700
Uh, oh, boy.
What happened?

13:04.702 --> 13:07.035
The temperature dropped faster
than we could've anticipated.

13:07.037 --> 13:08.636
The poles are frozen

13:08.638 --> 13:10.004
and the connecting struts
snapped.

13:10.006 --> 13:11.839
We can't put
this antenna together.

13:11.841 --> 13:13.640
Can't you guys just hold it up?

13:13.642 --> 13:14.874
This wind will blow the poles

13:14.876 --> 13:16.342
right out of our hands
in two seconds.

13:16.344 --> 13:18.194
I need this locked in tight,

13:18.195 --> 13:20.045
not held by people who can
barely feel their fingers.

13:22.015 --> 13:23.848
Let's wedge it in over there.

13:23.850 --> 13:25.916
We have no other choice.

13:27.185 --> 13:28.384
Hello? What am I looking at?

13:28.386 --> 13:30.753
Holy cow,
the feed's working again.

13:30.755 --> 13:31.854
Is anyone there?

13:31.856 --> 13:33.655
Captain Decker, can you hear us?

13:33.657 --> 13:35.890
I neither confirm nor deny
my identity.

13:35.892 --> 13:37.157
Who am I speaking with?

13:37.159 --> 13:38.858
I-I'm Paige Dineen.
This is Sylvester Dodd.

13:38.860 --> 13:40.626
We're Homeland Security
contractors

13:40.628 --> 13:42.260
helping you get the drone
diversion you need.

13:42.262 --> 13:43.828
It's almost daylight!

13:43.830 --> 13:45.362
Once the sun comes up,
they'll overtake us.

13:45.364 --> 13:47.063
When are the drones coming?

13:48.966 --> 13:50.231
Our team is on it.

13:50.233 --> 13:51.865
They're working
as fast as they can.

13:51.867 --> 13:54.400
We're four men holding off
a dozen unfriendlies.

13:54.402 --> 13:56.101
There's a very short clock
on us.

13:57.204 --> 13:58.236
Special forces

13:58.238 --> 13:59.637
wear diver's watches, right?

13:59.639 --> 14:00.904
You got a kid with you?

14:00.906 --> 14:02.272
Great.

14:02.274 --> 14:04.207
And you're the ones saving us?

14:04.209 --> 14:05.875
I'm Ralph.
If you want to buy some time,

14:05.877 --> 14:07.142
you should break the glass
of all your watches

14:07.144 --> 14:08.676
and throw them far from you.

14:08.678 --> 14:10.844
The moonlight will reflect
off of it, and bad guys

14:10.846 --> 14:12.879
will think there are a lot more
soldiers than just you four.

14:12.881 --> 14:14.881
They think we got
bigger numbers,

14:14.883 --> 14:16.048
they'll save ammo,

14:16.050 --> 14:17.949
fire at us less.

14:17.951 --> 14:20.017
That works.

14:20.019 --> 14:22.019
Guys, you heard the kid.

14:22.988 --> 14:25.787
You never cease to amaze me.

14:28.658 --> 14:29.857
CABE: Is it fitting in?

14:29.859 --> 14:31.859
HAPPY: Uh, I think so.

14:31.861 --> 14:33.026
I can't see two inches
in front of me.

14:33.028 --> 14:34.894
Push down harder!

14:35.930 --> 14:37.696
(grunts)

14:37.698 --> 14:39.130
Ah, damn it!

14:39.132 --> 14:40.865
It's just too cold.

14:40.867 --> 14:42.417
Quitting is not an option!

14:42.418 --> 14:43.968
We're trying, Cabe, but we
can't control the weather!

14:43.970 --> 14:46.737
No, we can't, but we can use it
to our advantage.

14:46.739 --> 14:50.707
So, everything around here
freezes instantly, even metal.

14:50.709 --> 14:51.908
So we pour water

14:51.910 --> 14:53.309
around the base of the poles.

14:53.311 --> 14:55.010
The water instantly freezes

14:55.012 --> 14:56.711
into a solid block of ice,

14:56.713 --> 14:58.946
and not even the wind
can blow it over.

14:58.948 --> 15:01.448
Makes sense, but how do we melt
ice in the Antarctic Circle?

15:01.450 --> 15:04.884
Back in the hut,
there are crates of MREs

15:04.886 --> 15:06.085
from McMurdo!

15:06.087 --> 15:08.253
They come
with mini heating units

15:08.255 --> 15:09.787
to warm food and drinks!

15:09.789 --> 15:11.155
By the time you get
down to the hut

15:11.157 --> 15:12.689
and make it back up
to the ridge,

15:12.691 --> 15:14.341
you will have a small window

15:14.342 --> 15:15.992
before the satellite is out
of range to make a connection.

15:15.994 --> 15:17.994
WALTER: You heard Sly,
we got to move.

15:17.996 --> 15:19.996
Follow the cable back!

15:19.998 --> 15:22.064
(rumbling)

15:22.066 --> 15:23.832
What the hell is that?

15:23.834 --> 15:25.366
I can't see for sure,

15:25.368 --> 15:26.734
but is that an ice shelf
above us?

15:26.736 --> 15:28.168
Chunks are about to come off.
Look out!

15:39.113 --> 15:40.412
You okay?

15:40.414 --> 15:41.479
I believe so. Toby, Toby?

15:41.481 --> 15:42.746
Walter, is that you?
Yeah.

15:42.748 --> 15:43.780
Come on, come on.

15:43.782 --> 15:45.782
Hey, Happy, you all right?

15:45.784 --> 15:48.117
Happy?
Quinn, where you at?

15:48.119 --> 15:50.036
Rope's 15 feet long,

15:50.037 --> 15:51.954
far enough for her not to be
able to hear you in this mess.

15:51.956 --> 15:53.021
Guys, something's wrong.

15:53.023 --> 15:54.422
This rope has too much give.

15:55.992 --> 15:58.025
The rope's cut!

15:58.027 --> 16:00.227
A falling ice block
must have severed it.

16:00.229 --> 16:01.828
Happy!
Happy!

16:01.830 --> 16:02.929
Happy!
Happy!

16:02.931 --> 16:05.097
ALL:
Happy! Happy!

16:05.099 --> 16:07.165
Doc!

16:09.969 --> 16:13.003
Walt!

16:13.005 --> 16:15.171
Anyone!

16:19.310 --> 16:20.809
My comm fell out.

16:22.445 --> 16:24.511
Ah... ah.

16:34.322 --> 16:36.388
Toby!

16:37.524 --> 16:39.790
(whimpering)

16:41.126 --> 16:43.893
Toby!

16:48.232 --> 16:50.198
Guys, we're not getting anything
from Happy's comms here,

16:50.200 --> 16:51.265
not even a signal.

16:51.267 --> 16:52.799
If it fell in the snow,

16:52.801 --> 16:54.367
it's as good
as instantly frozen.

16:54.369 --> 16:56.035
Guys, we got to
go find her.

16:56.037 --> 16:57.436
Shut up!
Don't tell me to shut up!

16:57.438 --> 16:59.838
She's lost!
Just be quiet and listen!

17:01.508 --> 17:04.108
HAPPY:
Toby!

17:04.110 --> 17:06.210
Toby!
That's Happy!

17:06.212 --> 17:07.277
What direction is
that coming from?

17:07.279 --> 17:08.811
WALTER:
Between the winds

17:08.813 --> 17:09.978
and the rock formation,

17:09.980 --> 17:11.145
you get distorted echolocation.

17:11.147 --> 17:12.546
It makes
pinpointing her impossible.

17:12.548 --> 17:14.147
Then we have to find her.

17:14.149 --> 17:16.282
We will, but the clock
is ticking on those soldiers.

17:16.284 --> 17:18.150
Now, we can still go after Happy

17:18.152 --> 17:19.501
when we're through.

17:19.502 --> 17:20.851
I will not let my friend die.

17:20.854 --> 17:22.019
Believe me, Toby.

17:22.021 --> 17:23.787
Neither will I.
What are you doing?

17:23.789 --> 17:26.022
She's your friend;
she's the love of my life.

17:26.024 --> 17:26.956
CABE:
I get it, Doc,

17:26.958 --> 17:28.157
but another missing person

17:28.159 --> 17:30.025
isn't gonna help us.

17:30.027 --> 17:30.992
You could both freeze to death!

17:30.994 --> 17:32.510
When humans sense danger,

17:32.511 --> 17:34.027
they instinctively run
towards the sun.

17:34.030 --> 17:35.863
I'll head
towards the low horizon

17:35.865 --> 17:37.097
and catch up to her.

17:37.099 --> 17:38.198
It's -40!

17:38.200 --> 17:39.499
Oh, really? I hadn't noticed.

17:39.501 --> 17:41.334
This is crazy, Toby.
Damn it, Walter!

17:41.336 --> 17:43.269
If Paige was out there,
would you go back to the hut?

17:47.541 --> 17:49.240
Be careful.

18:01.520 --> 18:04.320
Based on temperature,
Happy's weight,

18:04.322 --> 18:06.388
the insulation rating
of her gear

18:06.390 --> 18:08.189
and estimated thermal loss,

18:08.191 --> 18:10.391
she has 41 minutes
before she freezes to death.

18:10.393 --> 18:13.093
Toby has a little bit longer,
because he's bigger.

18:13.095 --> 18:15.395
This is bad, real bad.

18:15.397 --> 18:17.397
I'm getting Cooper
on the phone.

18:22.370 --> 18:24.403
Happy!

18:25.339 --> 18:27.405
Happy!

18:28.875 --> 18:30.441
I can't see anything.

18:30.443 --> 18:33.310
I have no idea where she is
or where I am.

18:33.312 --> 18:36.079
Toby, I promise,

18:36.081 --> 18:38.114
once we fix the antenna,

18:38.116 --> 18:40.182
save the soldiers,

18:40.184 --> 18:43.251
we'll figure out a way to get
a rescue party back to you.

18:43.253 --> 18:45.152
What do you mean,
"no rescue party"?

18:45.154 --> 18:46.386
You're Homeland. Do something.

18:46.388 --> 18:48.254
I don't care about
the weather.

18:48.256 --> 18:49.521
If you can send
them in there,

18:49.523 --> 18:51.222
you sure as hell
can pull them out.

18:51.224 --> 18:53.357
You know it's not her fault.

18:53.359 --> 18:56.059
I know, I'm just scared.

19:01.198 --> 19:02.363
(gunshots)

19:02.365 --> 19:03.997
RALPH:
Captain Decker?

19:03.999 --> 19:05.498
I think they're wise
to the watch trick, Ralph.

19:07.201 --> 19:08.867
I know severe stress
when I see it.

19:08.869 --> 19:10.635
Special Forces or not,

19:10.637 --> 19:12.053
a person can only take
so much.

19:12.054 --> 19:13.470
Captain Decker,
your file says you're 28.

19:13.473 --> 19:15.239
So you were 18 in 2005.

19:15.241 --> 19:16.573
Guess so.

19:16.575 --> 19:18.942
My mom likes songs
from when she was a teenager.

19:18.944 --> 19:20.276
I'll send you one from 2005.

19:20.278 --> 19:21.944
By the time it's over,
you'll be three minutes

19:21.946 --> 19:24.313
and 49 seconds closer
to being saved.

19:24.315 --> 19:25.380
(gunshots)

19:25.382 --> 19:28.015
âª We're always sleeping in âª

19:28.017 --> 19:31.918
âª And sleeping
for the wrong team âª

19:31.920 --> 19:35.521
"Going Down Swinging,"
Fall Out Boy.

19:35.523 --> 19:37.589
You got some sense
of humor, kid.

19:37.591 --> 19:39.290
âª I'll be your number one
with a bullet âª

19:39.292 --> 19:42.026
Thank you, Ralph.

19:42.028 --> 19:43.894
âª A loaded God complex,
cock it and pull it âª

19:43.896 --> 19:44.661
âª We're going down, down... âª

19:44.663 --> 19:46.195
Toby!

19:46.197 --> 19:49.531
âª Down, down, down,
down, down, down âª

19:49.533 --> 19:51.032
âª We're going down, down... âª

19:51.034 --> 19:53.667
Guys!

19:53.669 --> 19:56.436
âª A loaded God complex,
cock it and pull it âª

19:56.438 --> 19:58.288
âª We're going down, down in an earlier
round âª âª<i> Take aim at myself</i> âª

19:58.289 --> 20:00.139
âª Sugar, we're going down swinging
âª âª<i> Take back what you said</i> âª

20:00.141 --> 20:02.525
Guys!

20:02.526 --> 20:04.910
âª I'll be your number one with a
bullet âª âª<i> Take aim at myself</i> âª

20:04.912 --> 20:06.244
(screaming)

20:06.246 --> 20:09.046
âª A loaded God complex,
cock it and pull it. âª

20:20.559 --> 20:22.625
âª âª

20:48.419 --> 20:50.552
âª âª

21:01.564 --> 21:02.563
Get the heating packs.

21:02.565 --> 21:04.231
Toby, update?

21:04.233 --> 21:05.632
TOBY: Still no sign of Happy.

21:05.634 --> 21:07.700
Storm's kicking it up a notch.

21:07.702 --> 21:09.501
Temp is dropping.

21:09.503 --> 21:12.070
CABE:
You got to conserve energy.

21:12.072 --> 21:13.438
Screw that.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.139
Conserve energy, I slow down,

21:15.141 --> 21:16.640
and I slow down, Happy dies.

21:16.642 --> 21:17.741
I got everything; let's go.

21:17.743 --> 21:19.142
Hey, listen.

21:19.144 --> 21:22.145
We stay close,
we stay safe, understand?

21:22.147 --> 21:24.313
Close, safe, simple concepts.

21:24.315 --> 21:25.747
Okay.

21:25.749 --> 21:27.682
Sun's starting to come up.

21:27.684 --> 21:29.016
We're taking heavy fire.

21:29.018 --> 21:30.851
How much longer?

21:30.852 --> 21:32.685
Depends on how long it takes our
team to assemble that antenna.

21:32.688 --> 21:34.387
13 minutes?

21:34.389 --> 21:35.721
We can't hold out that long.

21:38.158 --> 21:41.192
Can you still see and hear me?

21:41.194 --> 21:42.493
Yes, sir, feed's strong.

21:42.495 --> 21:43.660
Can you record me?

21:43.662 --> 21:45.078
Yes, sir.
Good.

21:45.079 --> 21:46.495
I need to record a message
to my family.

21:46.498 --> 21:47.630
Will you do that?

21:47.632 --> 21:50.366
It's ready, Captain.

21:50.368 --> 21:52.034
Okay.

21:52.036 --> 21:54.503
Molly...

21:54.505 --> 21:57.506
I thank God every day
we found each other.

21:57.508 --> 21:59.574
I've never been
good enough for you.

21:59.576 --> 22:02.577
And you've never minded.

22:02.579 --> 22:07.381
And, Kyle... you're
the love of my heart.

22:09.017 --> 22:10.683
You take care of Mommy,

22:10.685 --> 22:12.351
and you help her
when the baby comes.

22:12.353 --> 22:16.088
And never, never forget.

22:16.090 --> 22:19.057
I'm always with you.

22:24.531 --> 22:26.531
(grunts)

22:26.533 --> 22:28.366
âª âª

22:42.548 --> 22:43.713
(shouts)

22:43.715 --> 22:46.382
Oh. Oh.

23:01.264 --> 23:02.796
Say yes to this, jackass!

23:10.338 --> 23:12.404
Not good.

23:14.608 --> 23:17.275
TOBY: Walter,
it's been 2,500 steps.

23:17.277 --> 23:19.343
(shivers)
Still no sign of Happy.

23:20.779 --> 23:22.378
Walter?!

23:24.348 --> 23:26.348
Walter?

23:26.350 --> 23:28.416
Walter, you there?!

23:32.255 --> 23:34.655
Oh, come on, warm up,
you piece of junk.

23:37.559 --> 23:38.824
Oh, no.

23:44.430 --> 23:46.763
Okay, God,
maybe you can hear me.

23:46.765 --> 23:48.431
I know I don't really
believe in you,

23:48.433 --> 23:52.101
but there's no atheists
in foxholes or-or blizzards.

23:52.103 --> 23:54.770
Look, if you really need
a soul that badly, take mine.

23:54.772 --> 23:55.771
You got that?

23:55.773 --> 23:57.339
Leave her alone!

23:57.341 --> 23:59.474
Does that come through
loud and clear?!

24:02.445 --> 24:04.511
Okay, then.

24:11.519 --> 24:13.552
CABE:
That water coming?

24:13.554 --> 24:15.520
We don't have much time.

24:15.522 --> 24:18.823
Boiling water freezes
faster than cold water.

24:18.825 --> 24:20.724
It's called the Mpemba effect.

24:22.260 --> 24:23.459
Ready?

24:28.665 --> 24:29.897
Okay, give it a tug.

24:29.899 --> 24:31.899
It should work.

24:31.901 --> 24:33.433
Solid!

24:33.435 --> 24:35.168
Okay.

24:35.170 --> 24:37.236
(Walter grunts)

24:47.414 --> 24:48.579
Sylvester!

24:48.581 --> 24:50.380
Antenna's up!

24:50.382 --> 24:51.581
We are at eight of ten
signal strength,

24:51.583 --> 24:52.648
ready to complete the link.

24:53.884 --> 24:55.416
(Sylvester laughs)

24:55.418 --> 24:56.550
Walter, it's working.

24:56.552 --> 24:58.418
Okay, back to the hut.

24:58.420 --> 25:00.653
I'll restart the drone's
operational software.

25:00.655 --> 25:02.187
You better hurry.

25:02.189 --> 25:03.755
Toby and Happy's cores
must be dropping fast.

25:06.659 --> 25:10.794
(weakly):
âª Shiny happy people âª

25:10.796 --> 25:14.664
âª Holding hands âª

25:14.666 --> 25:16.799
âª Shiny... âª

25:16.801 --> 25:20.335
âª Happy people... âª

25:20.337 --> 25:22.804
âª Shiny... âª

25:22.806 --> 25:25.706
âª Happy people. âª

25:25.708 --> 25:27.708
PAIGE:<i> You'll have the drones</i>
<i> operational in minutes.</i>

25:27.710 --> 25:29.576
My guys are doing their part.

25:29.578 --> 25:31.911
Now you need to get
a search team out immediately.

25:31.913 --> 25:33.579
I've left word repeatedly

25:33.581 --> 25:35.447
with the chairman
of the joint chiefs.

25:35.449 --> 25:37.449
They claim the storm
visibility is so low...

25:37.451 --> 25:39.584
(beeps) Uh, hold on,
here's the chairman.

25:39.586 --> 25:40.752
Chairman?

25:40.753 --> 25:41.919
CHAIRMAN:
Deputy Cooper, I'm sorry.

25:41.921 --> 25:43.553
I pulled every favor imaginable,

25:43.555 --> 25:45.221
and I can't get
the transport that you need.

25:45.223 --> 25:47.489
COOPER:
Mr. Chairman,

25:47.491 --> 25:48.857
Doug,

25:48.859 --> 25:52.861
you will find a way to send
a CH-53 Super Stallion

25:52.863 --> 25:54.863
to get them off that glacier,

25:54.865 --> 25:57.866
or I will call your wife
and tell her it was you,

25:57.868 --> 26:00.401
not the nanny, who left
the door open last year

26:00.403 --> 26:02.870
when the cat ran away.

26:02.872 --> 26:04.738
Julie really loved that cat.

26:06.608 --> 26:08.474
CHAIRMAN:
I'll get it done.

26:12.213 --> 26:13.745
Cooper's a badass.

26:15.715 --> 26:17.648
TOBY:
Happy!

26:19.418 --> 26:20.617
Happy!

26:29.627 --> 26:31.426
It's Quincy Berkstead.

26:32.862 --> 26:34.895
Happy. Happy!

26:34.897 --> 26:36.529
Happy? Happy?!

26:36.531 --> 26:38.297
Happy!

26:38.299 --> 26:41.466
Uh... uh...

26:41.468 --> 26:43.668
Happy, I'm coming!

26:47.540 --> 26:49.373
(grunts)

26:53.412 --> 26:55.512
Come on.

26:55.513 --> 26:57.613
Please tell me you're just
ignoring me like you usually do.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.482
Come on, come on.

26:59.484 --> 27:00.616
Come on.

27:00.618 --> 27:01.683
Happy. Happy.

27:07.790 --> 27:10.924
Happy. Happy, come on, you got
to have a little left in there.

27:12.427 --> 27:13.726
There it is, there it is.

27:13.728 --> 27:16.261
It's a slow pulse,
but it's a pulse nonetheless.

27:16.263 --> 27:17.895
You're alive, oh.

27:20.666 --> 27:21.798
If you're wondering
what you're hearing,

27:21.800 --> 27:24.333
it's me, Dr. Tobias M. Curtis,

27:24.335 --> 27:25.801
and I am talking to you

27:25.803 --> 27:28.737
because activity will help
keep both of us warm--

27:28.739 --> 27:30.905
me by working my jaw,

27:30.907 --> 27:33.274
and you by working
your brain.

27:33.276 --> 27:35.608
Come on.

27:38.846 --> 27:40.912
I know I've called you
cold and unfeeling,

27:40.914 --> 27:42.413
but this is ridiculous.

27:42.415 --> 27:44.748
But your heart is still warm,

27:44.750 --> 27:46.683
and you'll stay okay as long
as we can keep it warm.

27:51.523 --> 27:54.524
Okay, um...

27:54.526 --> 27:57.860
I would like to apologize
for what's about to happen.

27:57.862 --> 27:59.294
We need to get naked.

27:59.296 --> 28:00.762
It's not the way I'd imagined,

28:00.764 --> 28:02.797
but bottom line is,
I'm warmer than you,

28:02.799 --> 28:04.799
and skin-to-skin contact
is the fastest way

28:04.801 --> 28:06.934
to transfer what little body
heat I have over to you.

28:06.936 --> 28:09.536
Okay?

28:09.538 --> 28:12.872
So here, okay,
I'm gonna go first.

28:12.874 --> 28:14.740
(unzips)

28:14.742 --> 28:16.640
Just remember
it's really cold out here.

28:20.012 --> 28:22.012
Ralph.

28:22.014 --> 28:24.547
Looks like I'm down
to my sidearm.

28:24.549 --> 28:27.616
Pretty soon the bad guys
will figure that out.

28:27.618 --> 28:29.451
(guns firing)

28:29.453 --> 28:30.852
Hey, Ralph.

28:32.555 --> 28:34.021
I'm gonna turn my camera
off now, buddy.

28:34.023 --> 28:35.022
No.

28:35.024 --> 28:36.556
Scorpion will save you.

28:36.558 --> 28:39.175
Scorpion doesn't fail.

28:39.176 --> 28:41.793
Nah, you don't got to see
what's gonna happen.

28:41.796 --> 28:44.029
I just really appreciate
the song you sent.

28:46.066 --> 28:49.867
Thanks for keeping me
company, buddy.

28:56.574 --> 29:00.042
Sly, I have the drone
software linked back up,

29:00.044 --> 29:02.044
now please tell Cooper
to advise the Pentagon

29:02.046 --> 29:03.712
they have control of the drones.

29:03.714 --> 29:05.847
SYLVESTER:
I just messaged her,

29:05.848 --> 29:07.981
but the odds of the drones
making it there in time...

29:09.118 --> 29:11.418
Walter, we need to focus
on Toby and Happy.

29:11.420 --> 29:12.752
Now, Cooper has a chopper ready,

29:12.754 --> 29:14.587
but we need to give
them a location.

29:14.589 --> 29:16.055
There's no way to know
where they are,

29:16.057 --> 29:17.923
and we can't track them
in this storm

29:17.925 --> 29:19.624
since we lost contact with Toby.

29:20.927 --> 29:22.260
I learned in Forestry Braves

29:22.261 --> 29:23.594
that snakes hear
with their bellies.

29:23.596 --> 29:25.896
They feel the vibrations
in the earth.

29:25.898 --> 29:27.998
And you're on ice.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.001
Ice conducts sound three times
faster than water

29:31.003 --> 29:32.669
and 15 times faster than air,

29:32.671 --> 29:34.470
so maybe they could hear them
through the ice.

29:34.472 --> 29:36.939
Just need to, uh, build a...
a listening device then.

29:38.108 --> 29:42.643
The sonography machine that
they use to test ice samples.

29:42.645 --> 29:46.113
The electrodes on this
machine emit ultrasound waves

29:46.115 --> 29:48.882
that help scientists
see through the ice.

29:48.884 --> 29:51.618
But Happy and Toby aren't
under the ice, they're on it.

29:51.620 --> 29:53.620
Yeah, but if I can reverse
the generators,

29:53.622 --> 29:55.955
I can use the electrodes
to pick up the sound waves

29:55.957 --> 29:57.489
and to hear through the ice.

29:57.491 --> 29:59.090
Footsteps and yells
and any human sound

29:59.092 --> 30:00.624
would have to be Happy and Toby

30:00.626 --> 30:02.810
'cause they're the only
people around here.

30:02.811 --> 30:04.995
Precisely, so we need to get
as close to them as possible.

30:04.997 --> 30:06.396
(grunts)
All right.

30:08.666 --> 30:11.133
We can slide it out on this
to where we last saw Happy.

30:11.135 --> 30:12.167
(grunting):
It is uphill, though.

30:12.169 --> 30:14.068
We'll get it there. Come on.

30:15.838 --> 30:17.904
(grunting)

30:27.915 --> 30:29.714
Your breathing's
getting short.

30:29.716 --> 30:31.182
I wonder why.

30:31.184 --> 30:33.517
The cold's constricting
your blood vessels

30:33.519 --> 30:36.520
and making your already...

30:36.522 --> 30:38.955
high blood pressure
go even higher.

30:38.957 --> 30:41.291
You got to stop.

30:41.292 --> 30:43.626
We stop... Happy and
Toby don't make it.

30:43.628 --> 30:45.127
SYLVESTER:
15 meters more.

30:45.129 --> 30:48.663
Guys, even at the most generous
biological assumptions,

30:48.665 --> 30:52.767
Happy and Toby have got to be
very close to death by now.

31:00.042 --> 31:02.108
We're not gonna make it.

31:04.178 --> 31:06.444
I'm with you.

31:08.714 --> 31:11.781
I never thought I'd be so lucky
to go out like this.

31:28.832 --> 31:30.898
WALTER:
Okay!

31:36.571 --> 31:37.469
What do you got?

31:37.471 --> 31:38.636
I got nothing.

31:38.638 --> 31:39.803
Here, take a few steps.

31:39.805 --> 31:41.070
Let's test the hypothesis.

31:41.072 --> 31:43.705
(feedback over headphones)
Okay, yeah, loud and clear.

31:43.707 --> 31:45.707
So the crazy thing works?

31:45.709 --> 31:47.075
I still got
nothing.

31:47.077 --> 31:49.744
Our only chance to hear anything

31:49.746 --> 31:53.547
is to get the electrodes
deeper in the ice.

31:53.549 --> 31:54.915
You want deeper?

31:54.917 --> 31:56.216
Look out!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

31:56.218 --> 31:57.116
(gun fires)

31:57.118 --> 32:00.052
Yeah, that'll do nicely.

32:03.824 --> 32:05.890
(Walter grunts)

32:11.563 --> 32:13.262
Tell me you got something.

32:14.965 --> 32:16.497
(heart beating)
I got something.

32:16.499 --> 32:17.831
It sounds like a heartbeat.

32:17.833 --> 32:18.832
Son of a gun.

32:18.834 --> 32:19.899
For sure?

32:19.901 --> 32:21.934
Yeah, it's real.

32:22.937 --> 32:24.002
But it's only one.

32:31.143 --> 32:34.077
CABE:
It's found their location

32:34.079 --> 32:37.013
and it's 50 paces that way!

32:37.015 --> 32:38.781
Let's go!

32:44.921 --> 32:46.253
WALTER:
Toby!

32:46.255 --> 32:47.687
Toby!

32:47.689 --> 32:49.121
They're not moving.

32:50.090 --> 32:52.156
Here, here.

32:57.162 --> 32:58.661
WALTER:
Toby!

33:00.231 --> 33:01.630
Happy?

33:15.645 --> 33:16.844
They're both alive!

33:16.846 --> 33:18.679
Oh, my God...
(laughs)

33:18.681 --> 33:19.680
All right.

33:19.682 --> 33:20.647
Toby can barely move.

33:20.649 --> 33:21.781
Happy's not conscious.

33:21.783 --> 33:23.750
We need to reheat
them or they're dead

33:23.751 --> 33:25.718
before we can figure out a
way to get them out of here.

33:25.719 --> 33:27.686
Cabe, you got any of those MRE
heating pouches in your pack?

33:27.688 --> 33:29.187
Yes.

33:29.189 --> 33:30.788
We use those to warm them up.

33:30.790 --> 33:32.022
Then they can walk out of here.

33:32.024 --> 33:33.957
Those pouches are 200 degrees.

33:33.959 --> 33:35.091
You'll burn them alive.

33:35.093 --> 33:36.992
Not the way that
I'm gonna use them.

33:36.994 --> 33:39.561
I'm gonna heat the air
that they breathe.

33:39.563 --> 33:41.763
It'll warm them
from the inside out.

33:41.765 --> 33:43.264
(grunts)

33:50.806 --> 33:51.805
WALTER:
Toby!

33:51.807 --> 33:53.673
Breathe that in!
Hurry!

34:10.224 --> 34:11.756
It's working.
They're moving!

34:11.758 --> 34:13.124
Smart thinking, son.

34:26.105 --> 34:28.171
Hey, Doc...

34:28.173 --> 34:30.006
Hmm...

34:30.008 --> 34:31.841
Oh, it's good
to hear your voice.

34:34.011 --> 34:36.177
Are we...

34:36.179 --> 34:38.779
naked?

34:40.315 --> 34:43.882
Yeah, I saw a chopportunity
and I took it.

34:46.820 --> 34:47.885
Well, now that
we know that they're alive,

34:47.887 --> 34:49.152
how we gonna
get 'em out of there?

34:49.154 --> 34:50.887
PAIGE:
Hoist them out.

34:50.889 --> 34:52.822
Tie a figure eight follow
through in the end of the rope.

34:52.824 --> 34:54.223
That will make a loop.

34:54.224 --> 34:55.623
String the loop under their arms
and lift them up.

34:55.626 --> 34:56.691
I'll talk you through it.

34:58.761 --> 35:00.627
Oh, I knew Walter
wouldn't want to study knots,

35:00.629 --> 35:02.695
so I've been reading up.

35:03.998 --> 35:06.064
âª âª

35:10.870 --> 35:13.237
(Cabe grunting)

35:13.239 --> 35:15.939
(both grunting)

35:24.749 --> 35:26.982
(shouts)

35:26.984 --> 35:29.217
Okay, we got 'em up!

35:36.759 --> 35:39.359
(helicopter blades whirring)

35:39.361 --> 35:42.128
(man speaking indistinctly
over speaker) That's our ride!

35:42.130 --> 35:43.162
MAN:
We have your location.

35:43.164 --> 35:44.396
Hold your position.

35:51.270 --> 35:53.937
Hey.

35:53.939 --> 35:55.405
All our friends
are safe.

35:55.407 --> 35:57.840
Not everyone.

35:57.842 --> 36:00.676
I know.

36:00.678 --> 36:02.678
Captain Decker was very brave.

36:02.680 --> 36:03.812
But you know what?
He also...

36:03.814 --> 36:04.779
Guys, look.

36:04.781 --> 36:07.248
Team Scorpion, do you copy?

36:07.250 --> 36:08.182
We're here.

36:08.184 --> 36:09.850
So are we, pal!

36:09.852 --> 36:11.184
Thanks to you.

36:11.186 --> 36:13.352
Drones got to us just in time.

36:13.354 --> 36:14.986
Scorpion never fails.

36:14.988 --> 36:16.287
Guess not, kiddo.

36:16.289 --> 36:18.055
Hey, Ralph... my wife and I

36:18.057 --> 36:20.690
haven't been able to figure out
a name for our son-to-be.

36:20.692 --> 36:23.125
Was wondering how you felt
about us naming him after you.

36:33.336 --> 36:35.402
You need to keep your
core body temperature up.

36:35.404 --> 36:38.838
If I drink any more coffee,
I will jump out of my skin.

36:38.840 --> 36:41.006
We could get in
the sleeping bag again.

36:42.976 --> 36:44.108
I'll get you a sweater.

36:50.916 --> 36:52.415
Ditch the tea.
Bet's off.

36:52.417 --> 36:54.984
You earned it.

36:59.723 --> 37:01.389
Best cup I ever had.

37:01.391 --> 37:03.491
How's Happy doing?

37:03.493 --> 37:04.758
She's strong.

37:06.128 --> 37:07.994
You know, Walter
said he only heard

37:07.996 --> 37:09.962
one heartbeat out there
on that glacier.

37:09.964 --> 37:12.297
Maybe Happy's heart
stopped for a bit.

37:12.299 --> 37:14.899
Cardiac function ceases
quickly in subzero temperatures.

37:14.901 --> 37:18.068
Or maybe your hearts were just
perfectly beating together.

37:19.304 --> 37:21.036
That's love, kiddo.

37:24.474 --> 37:26.941
You still owe me 50 bucks.

37:34.983 --> 37:37.149
Oh. Posting new ferret videos?

37:37.151 --> 37:38.950
I'm shutting down my accounts.

37:38.952 --> 37:41.052
When I was in
that blizzard,

37:41.054 --> 37:43.487
all I thought about were
the real friends that I have.

37:43.489 --> 37:46.223
You were right;
maybe I should, uh,

37:46.225 --> 37:48.058
get out and meet some real,

37:48.060 --> 37:51.027
nondigital people.

37:52.930 --> 37:55.830
Uh, I think the, uh, human way
of saying that is,

37:55.832 --> 37:56.897
"I want to make new friends."

37:56.899 --> 37:58.498
I'd like to make new friends.

37:58.500 --> 38:01.300
(door opens)

38:01.302 --> 38:02.834
(door closes)

38:02.836 --> 38:04.836
Hey...  HAPPY: Hey, Dad.

38:04.838 --> 38:07.038
Thanks for coming.
Yeah.

38:07.040 --> 38:10.474
Uh... sorry about
that weird message I left.

38:10.476 --> 38:12.509
I just... I can't
get this song

38:12.511 --> 38:14.043
out of my head
and I thought

38:14.045 --> 38:15.778
it might have something
to do with you,

38:15.780 --> 38:16.779
crazy as that sounds.

38:16.781 --> 38:18.947
Well, it's not crazy.

38:18.949 --> 38:22.083
You, um, you have something
to play this relic on?

38:25.788 --> 38:28.121
So, when you were a baby,

38:28.123 --> 38:30.256
I would hold you in my arms

38:30.258 --> 38:33.058
and we would watch this video
over and over.

38:33.060 --> 38:34.926
WOMAN:
So, the yellow is nice...

38:34.928 --> 38:36.260
MR. QUINN:
Mm-hmm.

38:36.262 --> 38:38.061
...but the green,
the green is really pretty.

38:38.063 --> 38:39.062
MR. QUINN:
Pink. Pink, pink, pink.

38:39.064 --> 38:40.063
We have to pick neutral colors.

38:40.065 --> 38:41.565
MR. QUINN:
No, we don't.

38:41.566 --> 38:43.066
Let's go pink,
we're having a girl.

38:43.068 --> 38:44.567
I can feel it in my bones.

38:44.569 --> 38:46.001
Come on.

38:46.003 --> 38:47.186
WOMAN:
Oh...

38:47.187 --> 38:48.370
MR. QUINN:
Pink, pink. Oh, come on...

38:48.372 --> 38:50.505
Forget about the bumpers,

38:50.507 --> 38:52.073
forget about all of this.

38:52.075 --> 38:54.041
Come on, we need to dance,
we need to turn on music.

38:54.043 --> 38:55.409
âª âª
Come on.

38:55.411 --> 38:56.276
Okay.
Get to moving.

38:56.278 --> 38:58.011
Okay.

38:58.013 --> 39:02.015
âª Shiny happy people holding
hands âª (indistinct chatter)

39:02.017 --> 39:06.052
âª Shiny happy people laughing âª
The room's spinning, baby.

39:06.054 --> 39:07.319
Oh!
Ooh!

39:07.321 --> 39:09.387
(Mr. Quinn laughs, video stops)

39:11.824 --> 39:14.024
I wanted you to know your mom.

39:16.128 --> 39:18.228
I've never been as...

39:18.230 --> 39:21.130
open and carefree

39:21.132 --> 39:23.198
as you two in that video.

39:25.068 --> 39:27.902
You come from a place of joy,

39:27.904 --> 39:29.536
and you know that, deep down,

39:29.538 --> 39:31.070
because your amazing brain

39:31.072 --> 39:32.371
remembered that song
after all these years.

39:36.009 --> 39:38.075
I want to be
like you and Mom.

39:41.847 --> 39:43.046
But even though I got

39:43.048 --> 39:44.280
a second chance
at life today,

39:44.282 --> 39:45.581
I don't think I'm able.

39:45.583 --> 39:47.716
I think you are.

39:47.717 --> 39:49.850
You are, you just have to find
out what makes you happy...

39:51.254 --> 39:53.854
...Happy.

40:05.434 --> 40:06.966
TOBY: All right, put it
back in the deck, anywhere.

40:06.968 --> 40:08.434
Don't forget it.

40:08.436 --> 40:09.535
Now, just think of the card.

40:09.537 --> 40:10.602
Just keep it in your brain.

40:10.604 --> 40:11.636
Keep it in your head,
right there.

40:15.308 --> 40:17.308
Oh.

40:17.310 --> 40:18.642
Sorry.

40:18.644 --> 40:19.909
PAIGE: Guys, come
up to the roof!

40:19.911 --> 40:21.443
I have something
to show you!

40:21.445 --> 40:23.912
âª I know I can't run
from my nature... âª

40:23.914 --> 40:25.013
(laughs)

40:25.015 --> 40:28.116
So I thought,
after all that cold,

40:28.118 --> 40:30.885
we could cozy up by the fire
and sing some songs.

40:30.887 --> 40:32.219
And I've got everything we need.

40:32.221 --> 40:33.620
Tents, flashlights...

40:33.622 --> 40:35.655
I call not sharing
with Sylvester.

40:35.657 --> 40:37.123
He's got a snoring problem.

40:37.125 --> 40:38.958
I have a deviated septum.

40:38.960 --> 40:41.026
Why don't we, uh,
get the s'mores going?

40:41.028 --> 40:42.293
Come on.

40:42.295 --> 40:43.927
âª When you've got
somewhere to go... âª

40:43.929 --> 40:45.995
Hey.

40:46.964 --> 40:49.064
You want to be
bunkmates, cowboy?

40:50.667 --> 40:52.533
Do you mean, like,
in the same tent?

40:52.535 --> 40:54.601
No hanky-panky,

40:54.603 --> 40:56.302
but I figure if we can nude up

40:56.304 --> 40:58.170
in the same sleeping bag
together, we can share a tent.

41:00.307 --> 41:03.975
And I might still be
a little bit cold inside.

41:03.977 --> 41:06.444
So maybe you can spoon me,

41:06.446 --> 41:07.945
warm me up a little.

41:07.947 --> 41:10.212
âª Gotta get back... âª

41:12.916 --> 41:15.416
Done and done.

41:15.418 --> 41:16.417
WALTER:
Ralph.

41:16.419 --> 41:17.418
I got something for you.

41:17.420 --> 41:19.486
âª âª

41:21.389 --> 41:24.957
Brought a bit of
the South Pole back for you.

41:24.959 --> 41:27.125
There's a bunch more in that
cooler, a couple of others...

41:27.127 --> 41:28.926
Thanks, Walter.

41:28.928 --> 41:30.627
That is... that's very sweet.

41:30.629 --> 41:31.961
TOBY: Paige, what have we got?

41:31.963 --> 41:33.128
Organic chocolate, here?

41:33.130 --> 41:34.996
What kind of hippie
s'mores are we...

41:34.998 --> 41:35.997
Oh, my God.

41:35.999 --> 41:38.466
You are so dead!

41:38.468 --> 41:39.934
Hey, I'll cut him off, Ralph!

41:39.936 --> 41:41.669
Get some more
snowballs!

41:41.671 --> 41:42.703
You cannot use
the marshmallows!

41:42.705 --> 41:44.204
They are for
the s'mores!

41:44.206 --> 41:45.672
I was... I was worried
Ralph wouldn't connect

41:45.674 --> 41:47.707
with other people
because he has no siblings,

41:47.709 --> 41:51.143
but he's got
a whole bunch right here.

41:51.145 --> 41:54.412
Yeah, they're just not
as mature as he is yet.

41:54.414 --> 41:55.713
(Ralph and Paige laugh)

41:55.715 --> 41:57.648
You don't...

41:57.650 --> 42:01.718
