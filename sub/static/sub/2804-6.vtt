CABOT WAS TELLING
THE TRUTH.

31:29.626 --> 31:31.977
HE ARRIVED AFTER THE MURDER
AND TRIED TO HELP.

31:32.064 --> 31:33.935
ONLY THING
THE P.D. DIDGET RIGHT

31:34.022 --> 31:38.418
IS THAT THEY RETRIEVED
THE VICTIM'S HARD DRIVE.

31:38.505 --> 31:40.594
FOUND SOME VERY INTERESTING
E-MAILS

31:40.681 --> 31:42.117
HE EXCHANGED WITH STRINGER

31:42.204 --> 31:43.771
ABOUT THE CULPER DESCENDANTS.

31:43.858 --> 31:45.555
STRINGER USED HIM
FOR RESEARCH.

31:45.642 --> 31:48.645
AT FIRST, BUT EVENTUALLY
THE VICTIM GETS EVASIVE.

31:48.732 --> 31:52.040
STRINGER ACCUSED HIM OF HUNTING
FOR THE FLAG ON HIS OWN.

31:52.127 --> 31:53.563
YEAH, HE FELT THREATENED.

31:53.650 --> 31:55.174
HE'S A SOCIOPATH.

31:55.261 --> 31:58.481
HE THINKS THE FLAG IS THE KEY
TO REGAINING HIS RESPECT.

31:58.568 --> 32:00.179
SO, STRINGER KILLS THE VICTIM

32:00.266 --> 32:02.224
AND THEN GOES AFTER CABOT
FOR THE FLAG.

32:02.311 --> 32:03.878
HE DOESN'T KNOW HIS NAME
OR WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE,

32:03.965 --> 32:06.011
SO HE WAITS AT THE HOUSE
UNTIL SOMEONE FINALLY SHOWS UP.

32:06.098 --> 32:07.273
ENTER MOZZIE.

32:07.360 --> 32:09.014
THAT'S MY WORKING THEORY.

32:09.101 --> 32:11.146
BUT SHORT OF HAVING
STRINGER CONFESS,

32:11.233 --> 32:12.756
I DON'T KNOW
HOW I CAN PROVE IT.

32:12.843 --> 32:15.324
SO LET'S GET HIM
TO CONFESS.

32:15.411 --> 32:18.327
STRINGER BELIEVES THE CULPERS
STILL EXIST, RIGHT?

32:18.414 --> 32:19.763
LET'S PROVE THEY DO.

32:27.075 --> 32:28.903
MY VERTIGO
IS ACTING UP.

32:28.990 --> 32:30.992
ARE YOU SURE
YOU CAN DO THIS?

32:31.079 --> 32:33.429
HE'LL BE FINE.
HE'S HAPPY TO HELP.

32:33.516 --> 32:34.996
WE'RE ON, BOSS.

32:35.083 --> 32:37.216
STRINGER MUST HAVE GOTTEN
MY NOTE.

32:37.303 --> 32:38.913
I USED CULPER CODE
TO LURE HIM IN.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.349
5-6-1, 6-8-2 --

32:40.436 --> 32:41.916
YEAH, ENOUGH
WITH THE NUMBERS.

32:42.003 --> 32:44.049

FOR OUR CLOSE-UP.

32:44.136 --> 32:45.964
ALL RIGHT. GOOD LUCK.

32:58.889 --> 33:00.717

33:00.804 --> 33:04.765

WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?

33:04.852 --> 33:06.941

WANTS A MEETING.

33:07.028 --> 33:08.247

33:10.205 --> 33:11.990

33:12.077 --> 33:13.295

33:37.580 --> 33:40.061

YES.

33:40.148 --> 33:41.671

LOOKING FOR THE FLAG.

34:00.255 --> 34:01.778

LIKE GENTLEMEN.

34:01.865 --> 34:04.390
YOUR NETWORK'S SECRECY
HAS RUINED MY REPUTATION.

34:04.477 --> 34:05.652
WHY SHOULD I TALK TO YOU?

34:05.739 --> 34:07.175
BECAUSE I CAN REMEDY THAT.

34:09.612 --> 34:11.832
PLEASE. SIT.

34:11.919 --> 34:15.401
THE GENERAL
DOESN'T LIKE GUNS.

34:15.488 --> 34:17.055
I HOLD ONTO MY WEAPON,
OR I'M LEAVING.

34:19.057 --> 34:20.884
HOLSTER IT,
AND YOU CAN KEEP IT.

34:28.936 --> 34:31.417
YOU DO KNOW I'D BE MORE OF
AN ASSET IN THE ROOM WITH THEM?

34:31.504 --> 34:32.983
NEAL'S ENOUGH
OF A LIVE WIRE.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.985
I DON'T NEED A SPARK PLUG
IN THERE, TOO.

34:35.073 --> 34:36.987
THIS SPARK PLUG GOT HIM HERE,
DIDN'T HE?

34:37.075 --> 34:38.815
Neal: LET ME START BY SAYING THANK YOU.

34:38.902 --> 34:40.600
YOU'VE ACTUALLY DONE US A SERVICE

34:40.687 --> 34:42.863
BY ELIMINATING AGENT 7-2-2 FOR US.

34:42.950 --> 34:45.344
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.
YES, YOU DO.

34:45.431 --> 34:47.215
7-2-2 WAS A TRAITOR
WITHIN OUR NETWORK --

34:47.302 --> 34:48.912
FED YOU INFORMATION
FOR YOUR BOOK

34:48.999 --> 34:50.436

OUR EXISTENCE.

34:53.961 --> 34:56.703
I CAN'T SAY THAT UPSETS ME.

34:56.790 --> 34:59.184
I TAKE IT HE'S HOW YOU FOUND
OUR HEADQUARTERS HERE?

34:59.271 --> 35:02.665
HE SHOWED ME THE CORRESPONDENCE
WITH 7-2-3 ABOUT THE FLAG.

35:02.752 --> 35:05.277
I TRACED HIS I.P. ADDRESS
AND FOUND THIS PLACE.

35:05.364 --> 35:06.930
AND YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING IT
EVER SINCE.

35:07.017 --> 35:09.933
WELL, I WAS BEGINNING
TO WORRY THAT 7-2-3
HAD DISAPPEARED ON ME

35:10.020 --> 35:11.761
UNTIL HE SHOWED UP
A COUPLE DAYS AGO.

35:11.848 --> 35:13.372
HE HADN'T DISAPPEARED.

35:13.459 --> 35:15.591
HE WAS DETAINED
FOR THE MURDER YOU COMMITTED.

35:17.027 --> 35:19.334
SO THAT'SWHO THEY GOT.
KARMA.

35:19.421 --> 35:22.816
HE DIDN'T DENY
IT WAS HISMURDER.

35:22.903 --> 35:24.557
WELL, I HOPE YOUR GRATITUDE
INCLUDES A GIFT.

35:24.644 --> 35:25.993
I WANT THE FLAG.

35:26.080 --> 35:28.561
WE DON'T HAVE IT.

35:31.259 --> 35:33.957
BUT WE'D BE WILLING
TO JOIN FORCES IN THE HUNT.

AND WATCH MY DREAMS DIE.
