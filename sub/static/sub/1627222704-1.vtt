03:30.269 --> 03:33.205
The third woman missing
from city streets this month

03:33.239 --> 03:34.639
has been identified

03:34.672 --> 03:37.109
as 23-year-old
Danielle Stonewalker.

03:37.143 --> 03:38.643
Stonewalker...

03:40.678 --> 03:42.114
I worry about you sometimes,
Lakota.

03:42.148 --> 03:44.649
You knows, there's all these
women disappearing,

03:44.682 --> 03:48.254
and the cops,
they don't do nothin'.

03:48.287 --> 03:49.989
Shit.

03:50.022 --> 03:52.058
Language, Lakota!

03:53.059 --> 03:54.635
You ain't got to worry
about me, neechie.

03:54.659 --> 03:55.895
I got my girls looking out.

03:55.928 --> 03:58.197
And most important, I got me.

03:58.230 --> 04:01.666
And what did I tell you
about playing with that in here?

04:02.935 --> 04:04.636
I need both of you
on the red path

04:04.669 --> 04:06.771
and to realize your purpose.

04:06.805 --> 04:08.841
I'm not going to be
around here forever.

04:08.874 --> 04:09.842
Sure you are, Kôhkom.

04:09.875 --> 04:12.178
And what path are you on,
dear grandmother?

04:12.211 --> 04:14.213
Why aren't you gonna go see
a real doctor?

04:14.246 --> 04:16.348
This voodoo magic crap
isn't gonna work.

04:16.382 --> 04:17.816
You need real medicine.

04:17.850 --> 04:20.019
What I need is to reconnect
with our roots

04:20.052 --> 04:21.187
in the traditional ways.

04:21.220 --> 04:24.789
That's where true power
and real healing comes from.

04:24.823 --> 04:29.161
And I need you and Derrick
on this journey too.

04:29.195 --> 04:31.230
Gotta meet some friends
at the library, Kôhkom.

04:31.263 --> 04:32.630
Big test coming up.

04:32.664 --> 04:34.967
Lots of studying.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.702
See you later! Love you.

04:37.735 --> 04:41.173
Make sure you make it
to your classes today!

05:03.429 --> 05:06.832
You remind me a lot
of your father.

05:06.866 --> 05:10.369
Ron had the most amazing
ear for music.

05:10.402 --> 05:13.738
He was a natural, just like you.

05:13.771 --> 05:15.074
Yeah, Kôhkom, I know.

05:15.107 --> 05:19.811
He was a great player, and...

05:19.845 --> 05:23.215
the best son
a mother could ever have.

05:23.249 --> 05:26.018
But now you got me.

05:26.051 --> 05:29.121
The best grandson
you could ever have,

05:29.155 --> 05:33.225
and best of all is,

05:33.259 --> 05:34.827
I'm not leaving.

05:37.795 --> 05:39.398
I'm very sick.

05:39.431 --> 05:41.834
I might be the one leaving.

05:48.440 --> 05:50.042
Hey.

05:53.811 --> 05:55.881
I love you so much, Kôhkom.

06:00.085 --> 06:01.954
But...

06:01.987 --> 06:04.190
I don't know what to do
to make you better.

06:08.093 --> 06:12.064
You have great gifts
and a special purpose, Derrick.

06:15.834 --> 06:18.404
I want you to come
to Saddle Lake with me

06:18.437 --> 06:20.805
to see the medicine man.

06:20.839 --> 06:23.008
And he needs a new apprentice.

06:23.042 --> 06:26.445
No, I-I don't wanna go.

06:26.478 --> 06:31.350
I know you're scared
and unsure about your talents.

06:31.383 --> 06:34.987
But that's to be expected
from a boy your age.

06:38.123 --> 06:40.926
Anyway, I see things, you know,

06:40.960 --> 06:44.296
dark things sometimes.

06:44.330 --> 06:48.434
Just like the bad dreams
you had when you were little.

06:48.467 --> 06:53.239
You remember what I taught you?

06:53.272 --> 06:54.473
Yes, Kôhkom.

06:56.408 --> 06:59.245
That's it's my dream

06:59.278 --> 07:01.847
and I am in control.

07:01.880 --> 07:04.782
And I can make it
the way I want it.

07:04.816 --> 07:06.352
Exactly!

07:09.021 --> 07:12.024
Now. Time for a quick smudge
before school,

07:12.057 --> 07:14.560
to clear away
all the negative energy

07:14.593 --> 07:17.930
and make room for
some of the good stuff.

07:49.061 --> 07:53.565
Go back or die...

07:53.599 --> 07:59.438
Go back or die!

07:59.471 --> 08:00.472
Derrick!

08:00.506 --> 08:01.940
Are you okay?

08:07.346 --> 08:11.884
I thought I saw something,
but...

08:11.917 --> 08:14.153
it was probably...
it was probably nothing.

08:14.186 --> 08:16.588
When you were younger
and my little boy,

08:16.622 --> 08:19.892
I thought I could keep you safe.

08:19.925 --> 08:22.328
But that time is gone.

08:22.361 --> 08:26.065
Soon, you will be a man
and need a new teacher.

08:26.098 --> 08:27.499
But I don't want a new teacher!

08:27.533 --> 08:29.435
All is need is you and Lakota.

08:29.468 --> 08:33.472
The boy must die
to become a man.

08:33.505 --> 08:36.275
And I'm serious about you
coming to Saddle Lake.

08:36.308 --> 08:38.410
It'll be just
for a little while.

08:38.444 --> 08:40.012
But the band!

08:40.045 --> 08:42.915
The band will be here
when you get back.

08:42.948 --> 08:45.117
And school?

08:45.150 --> 08:48.320
I thought you hated school.

08:48.354 --> 08:52.224
And besides, you can take
your schoolwork with you.

08:52.257 --> 08:55.527
I already talked to Mr. Turner
about it.

08:57.629 --> 09:01.633
But we haven't left yet,
and you'll miss your bus.

09:01.667 --> 09:04.103
No more Indian time for you.

09:08.507 --> 09:09.508
Hey, come on, baby.

09:09.541 --> 09:10.943
There's no need for that.

09:10.976 --> 09:12.311
Give us a little taste.

09:13.445 --> 09:16.482
Go play with yourself already
and leave me alone!

09:16.515 --> 09:20.486
Listen to the dirty mouth
on this one.

09:20.519 --> 09:21.353
Stop!

09:21.387 --> 09:24.056
I don't think she's interested.

09:25.491 --> 09:27.226
Why don't you find
someone who is?

09:29.461 --> 09:30.396
My God.

09:30.429 --> 09:32.331
Aww.

09:32.364 --> 09:34.633
Don't you dirty Indians
believe in bathing?

09:34.666 --> 09:35.434
You smell like you just got back

09:35.467 --> 09:37.669
from cooking a squirrel
on the fire.

09:39.538 --> 09:42.274
Beat it, Tonto!

09:42.307 --> 09:43.307
Are you deaf...

09:47.112 --> 09:49.281
Let's go, handsome,
we gotta go now!

10:09.735 --> 10:11.136
Hey, Lakota.

10:11.170 --> 10:13.305
I saw your brother
at school this morning.

10:13.338 --> 10:16.208
Um, he helped save me
from those two greasy lebs.

10:16.241 --> 10:17.342
- Derrick?
- Mm-hm.

10:17.376 --> 10:20.379
My Derrick saved you from
those two pieces of shit?

10:20.412 --> 10:21.313
Sure did.

10:21.346 --> 10:24.583
And he's pretty cute, too.

10:24.616 --> 10:27.619
Never really got a chance
to say thank you properly.

10:30.355 --> 10:32.458
Sure he wouldn't say no, Traci.

10:36.628 --> 10:38.297
I keep offering.

10:42.367 --> 10:44.369
Pretty good score
at the park today, Lisa.

10:44.403 --> 10:47.539
Buddy bought almost a whole load
in one shot.

10:47.573 --> 10:50.075
That little rookie cop
is being a pain, though.

10:50.108 --> 10:52.744
She followed me
right out of the park.

10:52.778 --> 10:54.713
Might have to do something
about her.

10:54.746 --> 10:55.747
Michelle!

10:58.650 --> 10:59.518
What's up, boss?

10:59.551 --> 11:03.021
That little blonde piglet,
the new one?

11:03.055 --> 11:06.625
She's officially become
a real problem.

11:06.658 --> 11:09.094
And you're just dumb enough
to bring her here,

11:09.127 --> 11:11.063
ain't you, princess?

11:11.096 --> 11:12.364
I lost her a few blocks back.

11:12.397 --> 11:14.233
She's making it hard
to do business.

11:15.534 --> 11:19.104
Must be so hard
being stupid and a bitch.

11:19.137 --> 11:20.539
Maybe for you, breadbox.

11:22.241 --> 11:24.276
We're gonna fix this, Mich.

11:24.309 --> 11:26.545
Kota's my best earner.

11:26.578 --> 11:29.581
Make sure that cop finds
somewhere else to be.

11:31.250 --> 11:32.651
Told you never to call me that.

11:32.684 --> 11:36.455
Quit being such a hard-on
all the time, Mich! Here.

11:36.488 --> 11:39.258
Have a drink.

11:40.827 --> 11:42.394
I need a refuel.

11:42.427 --> 11:44.796
You know,
you could be nicer to her.

11:44.831 --> 11:47.733
It's not my fault she always
has a yeast infection.

11:50.302 --> 11:51.637
Off to Rock Central Station.

11:51.670 --> 11:54.106
Gonna be a busy one.

11:54.139 --> 11:56.275
Be extra careful out there,
Kota.

12:19.631 --> 12:20.631
Hi.

12:28.473 --> 12:30.175
What the hell
are you doing here?

12:30.208 --> 12:33.245
I'm gonna be playing right away.

12:33.278 --> 12:35.848
What the hell
are you doing here?

12:35.882 --> 12:38.650
I'm just picking up some money
and old friend of mine owes me.

12:40.920 --> 12:42.454
You're under 18.

12:42.487 --> 12:45.290
You and the bar could get
in a lot of trouble.

12:45.324 --> 12:46.291
It's not like I'm drinking.

12:46.325 --> 12:48.527
I just came here to play.

12:52.230 --> 12:53.866
Hey, everyone,
thanks for coming out.

12:54.901 --> 12:56.468
We are Centerfuge

12:56.501 --> 12:58.503
and came all the way
from the Big Apple

12:58.537 --> 13:00.772
to kick some ass!

13:03.508 --> 13:04.877
"The Big Apple"?

13:04.911 --> 13:08.280
Whatever. It's not like
they know the difference.

13:30.937 --> 13:35.340
♪ I got some money in the bank ♪

13:35.374 --> 13:40.412
♪ The kind I cannot spend ♪

13:40.445 --> 13:45.384
♪ I'm saving it
for that rainy day ♪

13:48.921 --> 13:53.425
♪ But I'm all shook up ♪

13:53.458 --> 13:57.562
♪ I been feeling low ♪

14:01.266 --> 14:03.201
I finally got you.

14:03.235 --> 14:05.470
This is gonna be sweet.

14:05.504 --> 14:07.372
I don't know what
you're referring to, Officer.

14:07.406 --> 14:08.674
I'm here to see the band play.

14:08.707 --> 14:11.209
- I love live music.
- Turn around.

14:11.243 --> 14:13.545
Face the wall.

14:13.578 --> 14:14.680
Spread 'em.

14:46.411 --> 14:50.482
Not gonna cough up that dope.

14:50.515 --> 14:55.454
When you mess up, and you will,

14:55.487 --> 14:57.857
you're gonna go down.

15:07.766 --> 15:11.570
I better not see you
around here again, Sampson.

15:40.799 --> 15:43.368
Do you have any idea
what time it is?

15:43.401 --> 15:44.469
This is a school night.

15:44.503 --> 15:47.907
And you, you were supposed
to be in bed hours ago.

15:47.940 --> 15:48.875
That's it.

15:48.908 --> 15:51.043
I'm nailing those windows shut
this time.

15:51.077 --> 15:53.445
Come on, Kôhkom, don't be a...

15:53.478 --> 15:54.746
What Derrick meant to say was

15:54.780 --> 15:56.782
we are both very sorry
for being out late.

15:56.815 --> 15:59.417
And I had a gig
and it went great.

15:59.451 --> 16:00.853
You know? And I got paid, too.

16:00.887 --> 16:04.023
Three hundred bucks,
tax free, you know?

16:04.056 --> 16:07.325
That's... that's pretty good, eh?

16:08.593 --> 16:15.067
To help pay for rent and...
everything else.

16:15.101 --> 16:17.937
Derrick, I know you were
wonderful tonight.

16:17.970 --> 16:19.005
Thank you.

16:19.038 --> 16:22.440
I need you to go upstairs
and get ready for bed.

16:34.786 --> 16:36.856
I want to talk with you.

16:36.889 --> 16:38.557
We haven't talked in so long.

16:38.590 --> 16:40.860
I feel like I don't even
know you anymore.

16:44.796 --> 16:46.431
Here. Take it.

16:46.464 --> 16:47.876
I got some cash
to help pay for things too.

16:47.900 --> 16:49.634
I don't want your dirty money.

16:49.668 --> 16:51.904
You don't think I know
what's going on?

16:51.938 --> 16:55.107
I was on these streets
before you were even born.

16:55.141 --> 16:56.108
Then you know
what you need to do

16:56.142 --> 16:58.577
in order to survive.

16:58.610 --> 17:00.445
This money doesn't know
where it's been.

17:00.478 --> 17:02.781
And we need it, as a family.

17:02.814 --> 17:05.918
You're a very smart
young woman, Lakota.

17:05.952 --> 17:07.619
Know just what to say.

17:10.089 --> 17:11.991
How was school today?

17:13.491 --> 17:14.861
It was great, uh...

17:14.894 --> 17:16.062
learned a ton.

17:16.095 --> 17:19.464
Ms. Smith is teaching us about
the Louis Riel rebellion.

17:19.497 --> 17:24.136
Learning about our heritage
is very important.

17:24.170 --> 17:25.838
When I talked
with Mr. Turner today,

17:25.872 --> 17:28.707
he says you haven't been
to school in weeks!

17:28.740 --> 17:31.010
Oh, well... he doesn't
know that I'm taking

17:31.043 --> 17:32.510
extra-credit classes, and...

17:32.544 --> 17:34.881
Don't lie to me,
Lakota Louise Sampson!

17:34.914 --> 17:37.749
Selling dope
and skipping school?

17:37.782 --> 17:39.618
What the hell is wrong with you?

17:39.651 --> 17:42.787
You want to end up dead
in an alley somewhere?

17:42.821 --> 17:44.623
Think it's easy out there?

17:44.656 --> 17:46.801
If you didn't make minimum wage
at that shit-eating job,

17:46.825 --> 17:49.028
maybe I wouldn't have
to help support this family.

17:49.061 --> 17:51.197
Watch your language!

17:51.230 --> 17:54.466
Look, it's, uh...

17:54.499 --> 17:56.102
it's getting really late
and, uh,

17:56.135 --> 17:59.671
I have to wake up really
early in the morning, so...

17:59.704 --> 18:03.075
can you guys just
argue a little quieter?

18:05.077 --> 18:06.979
Get upstairs, little brother.

18:07.013 --> 18:08.147
Now.

18:12.852 --> 18:15.654
I'm very disappointed
in you, Lakota.

18:15.687 --> 18:18.925
I thought I raised you
better than this.

18:18.958 --> 18:22.794
Please. I'm asking you
to work with me.

18:22.828 --> 18:24.663
You're headed down
the black path.

18:24.696 --> 18:26.132
I've seen it before.

18:26.165 --> 18:27.199
Save it.

18:27.233 --> 18:28.968
And keep the dirty money.

18:29.001 --> 18:30.502
You're gonna need it...

18:30.535 --> 18:31.904
Marie.

19:32.965 --> 19:35.134
Hey, cowboy.

19:35.167 --> 19:36.268
Coke?

19:42.707 --> 19:44.542
It's all right, I got ya.

19:44.576 --> 19:46.711
I don't feel so good.

19:46.745 --> 19:48.613
Uh, you can't leave
out this door, guys.

19:48.646 --> 19:49.748
Emergency exit only.

19:49.781 --> 19:50.892
You'll have to use
the front doors.

19:50.916 --> 19:52.160
Just a little bit
too much to drink.

19:52.184 --> 19:53.219
She just needs some air.

19:53.252 --> 19:55.687
- We didn't drink anything!
- Like, right now.

21:00.986 --> 21:03.956
Let me out!

21:03.989 --> 21:06.624
Let me...

21:29.681 --> 21:31.783
You look beautiful, Kôhkom.

21:34.186 --> 21:36.055
You ready to take
your grandmother outside,

21:36.088 --> 21:37.356
young man?

21:37.389 --> 21:39.091
Are you sure you don't want
to come with me

21:39.125 --> 21:40.792
to Saddle Lake?

21:40.825 --> 21:43.661
I need you to understand
how very important

21:43.695 --> 21:45.197
this trip is

21:45.231 --> 21:47.433
to me and to you.

21:47.466 --> 21:49.068
I don't think I need to go.

21:49.101 --> 21:51.203
Need someone to help you
with your visions?

21:51.237 --> 21:54.140
You haven't had nightmares
since you were small.

21:54.173 --> 21:57.376
- I think that...
- It's nothing, really.

21:57.409 --> 21:59.411
It's nothing.

22:00.980 --> 22:03.282
Too much coffee,
you know my nerves, I...

22:03.315 --> 22:05.750
I get anxious sometimes.

22:05.783 --> 22:07.295
The medicine man wants
to talk to you, and...

22:07.319 --> 22:09.955
I have to finish
this weekend's show.

22:09.989 --> 22:11.390
It's worth a thousand bucks.

22:11.423 --> 22:13.791
It'll go a long way
to help with all the bills.

22:13.825 --> 22:15.760
I let you get away with a lot,

22:15.793 --> 22:18.197
but that time
is coming to an end.

22:18.230 --> 22:19.398
You need to start acting

22:19.431 --> 22:21.233
- like a ma...
- When the gig is over,

22:21.267 --> 22:23.768
I swear that Lakota and I
will come and visit you.

22:23.801 --> 22:25.471
And see the medicine man?

22:25.504 --> 22:27.006
You promise?

22:29.074 --> 22:32.211
Cross my heart and hope to die.

22:39.485 --> 22:42.288
You have to let go of me
sometime, Derrick.

22:45.090 --> 22:48.994
And tell Lakota I'm sorry,

22:49.028 --> 22:53.065
that I don't like it
when we fight like this.

22:53.098 --> 22:56.135
I love both of you
more than you know.

22:56.168 --> 22:57.403
See you soon.

23:33.038 --> 23:34.506
Wake up!

23:34.540 --> 23:35.807
Look what we have here.

23:35.841 --> 23:38.911
A wanna-be boy hero.

23:38.944 --> 23:41.513
We're taking this guitar, chump,
to start.

23:41.547 --> 23:43.349
But...

23:45.551 --> 23:47.453
We can take whatever we want.

23:53.425 --> 23:55.828
No, no!

23:55.861 --> 23:57.229
Pick him up.

23:59.531 --> 24:01.133
You're in big trouble, prigger.

24:01.166 --> 24:03.369
Standing up for that slut's
gonna cost you.

24:03.402 --> 24:06.105
It's gonna hurt the guitar
more than you.

24:17.483 --> 24:18.816
Dool.

24:18.851 --> 24:20.352
If I see you
or your retard boyfriend

24:20.386 --> 24:22.454
hassling anyone else again,

24:22.488 --> 24:24.123
you're history.

24:24.156 --> 24:25.958
Now, get outta here
before someone finds out

24:25.991 --> 24:28.227
you got beat up by a girl.

24:33.532 --> 24:35.968
You look rough.

24:36.001 --> 24:39.171
I'm... I'm okay.

24:39.204 --> 24:41.340
Can I have my guitar back,
please?

24:41.373 --> 24:43.013
You're gonna have to learn
how to stand up

24:43.042 --> 24:46.312
to these kinds of...

24:46.345 --> 24:47.546
monsters.

24:49.948 --> 24:52.484
Hey! Cardinal!

24:52.518 --> 24:54.987
You're not supposed
to be on school property.

24:58.123 --> 25:00.459
And beatin' on a student.

25:00.492 --> 25:01.493
That's a no-no.

25:01.527 --> 25:03.896
You're going back to jail
where you belong.

25:03.929 --> 25:05.297
Jesus, Georgie.

25:05.331 --> 25:07.933
Think I'd be hanging out
if I beat this kid up?

25:07.966 --> 25:09.311
That's not what happened
at all, Georgie.

25:09.335 --> 25:10.936
- She stopped...
- It's Officer Karras,

25:10.969 --> 25:13.072
and you shut up
until I ask you something.

25:13.105 --> 25:15.307
I came here to look
for a good friend of mine.

25:15.341 --> 25:17.109
Thought she may have been here.

25:17.142 --> 25:19.945
Her mom hasn't seen her,
no one has.

25:19.978 --> 25:22.981
That's her.

25:23.015 --> 25:23.982
So you can't find her,

25:24.016 --> 25:25.627
so you figured you'd
squeeze some information

25:25.651 --> 25:27.286
out of Desjardins?

25:27.319 --> 25:30.122
I-I saved a girl
from those two assholes,

25:30.155 --> 25:34.159
Jibril and Nasim, and... and...

25:34.193 --> 25:37.129
What are you getting at, boy?

25:37.162 --> 25:38.664
Who do you think beat me up?

25:38.697 --> 25:40.966
Jesus, Georgie.

25:40.999 --> 25:42.477
Don't they teach you
any kind of deduction

25:42.501 --> 25:43.969
in cop school?

25:44.002 --> 25:46.372
Officer Karras,
report immediately to...

25:48.974 --> 25:51.610
I gotta go.

25:51.643 --> 25:53.612
I want you off school property.

25:53.645 --> 25:55.280
Right now, Cardinal.

25:55.314 --> 25:56.515
Sure, Georgie.

25:56.548 --> 25:58.384
Whatever you want.

26:00.686 --> 26:04.022
And you, Desjardins.

26:04.056 --> 26:08.193
Go... clean yourself up, boy.

26:08.227 --> 26:11.997
Bleeding all over the place
like a stuck pig.

26:12.030 --> 26:14.967
What about the missing girl,
Officer Karras?

26:15.000 --> 26:16.935
Aren't you gonna help find her?

26:18.437 --> 26:19.605
See what I can do.

26:23.275 --> 26:25.244
All right, put the guitar down.

26:25.277 --> 26:27.146
You're getting blood
all over it.

26:31.316 --> 26:34.586
I don't even know
your first name.

26:34.620 --> 26:36.054
I'm Derrick.

26:36.088 --> 26:37.489
I know who you are.

26:37.523 --> 26:39.458
Lakota's baby brother.

26:41.026 --> 26:42.561
I'm looking for your sister.

26:42.594 --> 26:45.697
She's supposed to meet me
and never showed.

26:45.731 --> 26:49.435
Yeah, her and Kôhkom
got in a big fight last night.

26:49.468 --> 26:51.503
She left pretty upset.

26:51.537 --> 26:53.472
I haven't seen her since.

26:57.242 --> 26:59.678
Why did you lie
to Officer Karras?

26:59.711 --> 27:01.280
You know he could have
helped us.

27:01.313 --> 27:03.048
I don't trust Georgie.

27:03.081 --> 27:04.450
We go way back on the streets,

27:04.483 --> 27:08.954
and he seems like
he wants to help, but...

27:10.622 --> 27:13.225
Eh. It's all about him.

27:18.230 --> 27:20.208
Lakota might have went back
to Rock Central Station.

27:20.232 --> 27:22.201
That was next on my list.

27:22.234 --> 27:23.344
Come on,
let's get the hell out of here

27:23.368 --> 27:26.371
before Georgie makes it back.

27:35.280 --> 27:37.749
Rock Central Station.

28:11.483 --> 28:13.318
Turn that shit down!

28:19.324 --> 28:22.060
When I talk to you,
you better listen,

28:22.094 --> 28:24.630
or I'm not paying your rent.

28:27.566 --> 28:30.135
Now, you're gonna be
on your hands and knees

28:30.168 --> 28:32.471
to clean up
every goddamned speck.

28:32.504 --> 28:33.539
You get that?

28:36.174 --> 28:37.309
Now, what did I say?

28:37.342 --> 28:40.812
On your hands and knees
until this is all cleaned up.

28:40.847 --> 28:42.548
But where am I
supposed to put them?

28:42.581 --> 28:44.683
Charlie, just relax
for a minute.

28:44.716 --> 28:47.286
Ty's gonna clean this up
and turn the radio down.

28:47.319 --> 28:49.154
Aren't you, honey?

28:49.187 --> 28:50.789
This kid's gotta learn respect

28:50.822 --> 28:52.190
just like I did.

28:58.898 --> 29:01.133
Ty, I got your favorite lunch.

29:01.166 --> 29:02.234
KD with wieners,

29:02.267 --> 29:05.404
and I cut 'em up
just the way you like 'em.

29:11.243 --> 29:14.179
Charlie was just trying
to make a man out of you.

29:14.212 --> 29:18.317
He loves you,
but he's, um, complicated.

29:18.350 --> 29:21.854
I can do without
that kind of love.

29:21.888 --> 29:24.323
Eat it up, honey.

29:30.897 --> 29:32.497
Screw both of you!

29:35.701 --> 29:37.870
Hard learner, huh?

29:37.904 --> 29:40.606
Come here,
you worthless piece of shit.

29:44.576 --> 29:46.511
Mom!

29:46.545 --> 29:49.214
Charlie...

29:50.782 --> 29:54.753
Look what you made me do,
you stupid bitch.

29:54.786 --> 29:57.489
They'll put me away forever
this time.

29:57.522 --> 30:02.294
I saw him trip
and fall down the stairs.

30:02.327 --> 30:04.329
What are you talking about,
woman?

30:04.363 --> 30:07.799
He's a clumsy boy,
he's always falling down.

30:07.834 --> 30:09.768
Just like cousin Geordie.

31:01.653 --> 31:03.555
Let me out of here, you asshole!

32:13.059 --> 32:13.926
Yeah.

32:13.960 --> 32:15.327
Whatever, dickhead.

32:37.549 --> 32:39.785
What in the holy hell
happened to you?

32:39.818 --> 32:42.922
It's... it's been a real
shitty day, Jon.

32:42.955 --> 32:45.958
Listen. I can't play tonight.

32:45.992 --> 32:47.626
What you talkin' 'bout, Willis?

32:47.659 --> 32:51.663
I'm not gonna be here for
the rest of the weekend, either.

32:51.696 --> 32:54.800
Lakota's missing, and I...

32:54.834 --> 32:57.803
That bad, hey?

32:57.837 --> 33:01.908
Well, I, uh, always wanted
to be the lead singer anyway.

33:08.915 --> 33:12.885
I, uh, don't believe
that we've had the pleasure.

33:12.919 --> 33:15.955
I'm, uh...

33:15.988 --> 33:17.556
Later.

33:22.862 --> 33:26.398
Spying on the student body
again, eh, Georgie?

33:26.431 --> 33:29.367
Just stand still for a minute,
baby brother.

33:29.401 --> 33:30.870
Can't go walking around
like an extra

33:30.903 --> 33:34.106
from a zombie flick.

33:34.140 --> 33:37.109
So was Lakota here last night
or what?

33:37.143 --> 33:39.078
Oh, she was here, all right.

33:39.111 --> 33:41.013
Came in near close
and left with some guy.

33:41.047 --> 33:42.414
Pretty hammered, too.

33:42.447 --> 33:43.558
Went right out
the emergency doors

33:43.582 --> 33:45.151
after I told them not to.

33:45.184 --> 33:47.854
My sister does not
do drugs or drink.

33:52.457 --> 33:54.593
'Scuse me, miss?

33:54.626 --> 33:57.762
You don't have security cameras
out back, do you?

33:57.796 --> 34:00.465
It's Dana, and yeah,
we had some put in

34:00.498 --> 34:02.034
after our bouncer
almost got killed.

34:02.068 --> 34:04.837
I'm gonna need to see
the footage from last night.

34:04.871 --> 34:06.138
Like, right now.

34:09.208 --> 34:10.843
Come on.

34:13.445 --> 34:15.114
Can't make out a license plate.

34:15.147 --> 34:18.750
Are you... sure you don't have
anything better-quality?

34:19.751 --> 34:21.153
What you see is what you get.

34:21.187 --> 34:23.421
This isn't exactly a pro setup.

34:23.455 --> 34:24.957
Now, if that's it,

34:24.991 --> 34:27.492
I gotta get back to work
before my boss comes in.

34:27.525 --> 34:29.628
No, but you have
to help us find her!

34:29.661 --> 34:31.563
I need to find my sister.

34:31.596 --> 34:34.566
You... you have to help, please.

34:34.599 --> 34:36.635
This isn't her fault.

34:36.668 --> 34:38.070
She's helping the best she can.

34:38.104 --> 34:41.040
Let Dana get back to work
and we'll talk outside.

34:49.215 --> 34:50.983
This footage will get us
a meeting downtown

34:51.017 --> 34:52.885
with the inspector.

34:52.919 --> 34:53.785
And maybe, just maybe,

34:53.818 --> 34:56.621
I might be able
to get some traction.

34:56.655 --> 34:58.790
Now the fact that she was wasted

34:58.823 --> 35:00.659
tells me that either
she changed overnight

35:00.692 --> 35:03.829
from the friend I've known
the last five years, or...

35:03.863 --> 35:06.198
- But Lakota's...
- It's probably Special K

35:06.232 --> 35:08.533
or GHB.

35:08.566 --> 35:10.937
Date-rape drugs.

35:10.970 --> 35:14.106
I saw it a lot
when I was on the streets.

35:14.140 --> 35:15.540
A girl that I had helped,

35:15.573 --> 35:17.776
she was drugged
and managed to escape.

35:17.809 --> 35:18.743
Lemme guess:

35:18.777 --> 35:20.779
From a guy in a cowboy hat
in a black car?

35:20.812 --> 35:23.983
You're a real smart kid,
Cardinal.

35:24.016 --> 35:28.687
Now, shut up and
let me do the investigating.

35:28.720 --> 35:32.058
When I talked to her,
she was scared to death.

35:32.091 --> 35:33.725
But I learned something.

35:33.758 --> 35:34.836
He kept staring at the moon

35:34.860 --> 35:37.196
and mumbling something about
how he wasn't gonna

35:37.229 --> 35:39.131
let her hurt him again.

35:39.165 --> 35:41.901
I think he hunts on a full moon.

35:41.934 --> 35:44.769
It fits some of
the other disappearances.

35:44.803 --> 35:46.906
No. No, she has to be okay,
okay?

35:46.939 --> 35:48.673
She has to.

35:48.707 --> 35:49.674
Her and Kôhkom are all I got,

35:49.708 --> 35:52.912
- and if I lose something...
- We will find her,

35:52.945 --> 35:55.081
and Georgie's going to help us.

35:55.114 --> 35:56.514
There's no distinct proof.

35:56.548 --> 35:58.583
This guy is really good.

35:58.616 --> 36:02.121
But... I found
a stretch of highway

36:02.154 --> 36:03.222
called the Road of Tears.

36:03.255 --> 36:05.095
It's near where some
of the other missing women

36:05.124 --> 36:08.828
were seen hitchhiking.

36:08.861 --> 36:10.830
It's the only real lead I have.

36:13.933 --> 36:16.268
Oh. And you two,

36:16.302 --> 36:17.736
you're staying here in town.

36:17.769 --> 36:21.107
This guy's a frickin' lunatic.

36:21.140 --> 36:22.875
I'm gonna save Lakota.

36:22.908 --> 36:24.609
And then I'm gonna go and...

36:24.642 --> 36:27.880
You're gonna plant your ass
here like I told you to, boy.

36:29.215 --> 36:30.715
I need both of you here,

36:30.749 --> 36:32.284
for questioning
and to keep you safe.

36:32.318 --> 36:34.120
This is police business.

36:36.588 --> 36:39.291
Gonna get this footage
over to our tech,

36:39.325 --> 36:41.227
see what else
we can come up with.

36:46.598 --> 36:47.967
Desjardins!

36:50.036 --> 36:52.737
I don't wanna catch you
in here again.

36:52.771 --> 36:54.273
You're still a minor.

37:01.914 --> 37:03.883
But we need his help
to find Lakota.

37:03.916 --> 37:04.850
Screw him.

37:04.884 --> 37:05.961
I've been burned a few times,

37:05.985 --> 37:08.087
that's good enough for me.

37:08.120 --> 37:11.223
We're on our own.

37:12.958 --> 37:15.061
I'm here for you, baby brother.

37:15.094 --> 37:18.297
We'll find Lakota together,
I promise.

37:18.330 --> 37:19.231
Now, come on.

37:19.265 --> 37:21.133
We need to find a way
to the grasslands.

37:49.295 --> 37:50.830
Thank you.

37:59.138 --> 38:01.407
Aw, this is awesome.

38:01.440 --> 38:05.845
Bet there's no cell phone tower
for miles.

38:05.878 --> 38:07.645
I don't know, you know?

38:07.679 --> 38:08.813
It's kinda nice.

38:08.848 --> 38:10.724
I haven't been out of the city
since Kôhkom took

38:10.748 --> 38:12.251
me and Lakota when we were kids.

38:14.887 --> 38:16.088
What, is something wrong?

38:16.122 --> 38:16.956
Am I okay?

38:16.989 --> 38:18.790
Just looking for
the lobotomy scars.

38:18.823 --> 38:21.393
This place is a dump!

38:21.427 --> 38:23.229
Come on, let's get a room.

38:23.262 --> 38:25.898
I don't wanna be here
any longer than I have to.

38:28.834 --> 38:30.836
Hi, is Kôhkom there?

38:30.870 --> 38:35.773
I'm sorry...
is Marie Desjardins there?

38:38.911 --> 38:41.746
Can you let her know that
her grandson Derrick called

38:41.779 --> 38:44.884
and I'll try again later?

38:44.917 --> 38:48.220
Thanks.

38:51.924 --> 38:54.692
I miss you, Kôhkom.

38:55.727 --> 38:58.063
I don't know if I can do this
without you.

38:59.331 --> 39:02.935
Sure you can, baby brother.

39:02.968 --> 39:04.937
What the hell was that
back in the lobby?

39:04.970 --> 39:06.939
Not signing your name
for the room?

39:06.972 --> 39:08.908
I didn't wanna
write my name down.

39:08.941 --> 39:11.243
What happens if the cops
come looking for us?

39:11.277 --> 39:15.281
Jesus! You don't use
your real goddamned name.

39:18.217 --> 39:19.751
Well, what is your name?

39:19.784 --> 39:23.355
I know your last name
is Cardinal, but...

39:23.389 --> 39:27.193
In this case, I'm using the name
that's on the credit card.

39:27.226 --> 39:30.129
Wait, where'd you get
the credit card from?

39:30.162 --> 39:32.264
Is it stolen?

39:32.298 --> 39:35.267
I wish I woulda got a better
look at Georgie's map, but

39:35.301 --> 39:37.469
I'm pretty sure
it's right around here.

39:37.503 --> 39:40.139
Let's get packed up
and get the hell outta here.

39:40.172 --> 39:43.509
You're in charge
of the chow and water.

39:43.542 --> 39:45.177
Okay, but we're gonna
smudge first.

39:45.211 --> 39:49.114
And what possible reason
would I wanna do that?

39:49.148 --> 39:52.084
'Cause I can see things
that most people can't,

39:52.117 --> 39:54.887
and I need to be smudging
to see it.

39:54.920 --> 39:59.892
Look, I really don't wanna
do this, but...

39:59.925 --> 40:01.994
if I don't...

40:02.027 --> 40:04.296
I haven't smudged since...

40:07.900 --> 40:10.202
It was a long time ago
with my dad.

40:10.236 --> 40:13.839
And just what makes you think
I can help you?

40:13.872 --> 40:15.841
Just a feeling.

40:15.874 --> 40:17.843
Trust me, please.

40:17.876 --> 40:20.546
We need to find my sister
right now,

40:20.579 --> 40:23.048
and this is our best shot.

40:35.461 --> 40:36.428
What?

40:36.462 --> 40:38.063
What do you want from me?

40:40.165 --> 40:42.167
I'm not gonna eat
your dog's food!

40:42.201 --> 40:44.570
Might as well kill me now.

40:47.373 --> 40:48.340
What?

40:48.374 --> 40:50.009
What do you want me to do?

41:19.471 --> 41:22.841
Gonna make me eat like a dog
again for you?

41:22.875 --> 41:28.147
Got the balls to come in here
without a knife this time?

41:28.180 --> 41:30.015
You like me naked
on my knees for you,

41:30.049 --> 41:32.318
don't you, you asshole?

41:32.351 --> 41:34.053
Look down.

41:46.365 --> 41:48.033
What is wrong with you?

41:48.067 --> 41:51.370
You kidnap me, torture me,
drug me,

41:51.403 --> 41:54.273
then you wanna play nice?

41:55.407 --> 41:56.942
Kill me, then.

41:56.975 --> 41:58.577
I don't care anymore.

41:58.610 --> 42:00.212
I've had it.

42:00.245 --> 42:02.915
Come in here and stand up to me,

42:02.948 --> 42:04.350
if you're man enough.

42:04.383 --> 42:06.085
Enough!

42:15.961 --> 42:18.597
As soon as I saw you,

42:18.630 --> 42:20.299
I knew I had to have you.

42:23.035 --> 42:27.106
You remind me a lot of...

42:27.139 --> 42:28.374
someone.

42:30.542 --> 42:33.445
But you need to learn respect

42:33.479 --> 42:35.147
and who's in charge.

42:37.716 --> 42:41.420
You can't just kidnap people
and torture them, buddy.

42:41.453 --> 42:45.324
You're going to jail
for the rest of your life.

42:48.594 --> 42:50.529
I really do like you.

42:54.566 --> 42:56.402
But...

42:56.435 --> 42:58.036
Then let me go, please!

42:58.070 --> 43:01.974
I won't say anything, I promise.

43:09.014 --> 43:10.449
You're awake.

43:10.482 --> 43:11.683
Well, that's great.

43:11.717 --> 43:13.519
We were getting
a little worried.

43:13.552 --> 43:16.722
That was quite a spill you took.

43:16.755 --> 43:18.624
Mom?

43:18.657 --> 43:20.392
I'm Dr. Connors,

43:20.426 --> 43:23.128
the neurologist assigned
to your case.

43:23.162 --> 43:25.664
And you can call me Julie.

43:25.697 --> 43:27.733
I need you to pay attention

43:27.766 --> 43:30.536
to what
I'm going to tell you, okay?

43:30.569 --> 43:32.237
This is very important.

43:32.271 --> 43:35.174
You suffered a major
traumatic brain injury,

43:35.207 --> 43:37.176
and we were able
to stem the bleeding

43:37.209 --> 43:39.044
and shield your brain
with a metal plate.

43:39.077 --> 43:41.313
Does that mean I'll be okay?

43:41.346 --> 43:44.049
You're young enough
to be able to shake this off.

43:44.082 --> 43:45.527
And we should be able
to get that plate out

43:45.551 --> 43:48.320
once you're all healed up,
but...

43:48.353 --> 43:50.722
you need to take these meds
every day

43:50.756 --> 43:52.624
for the rest of your life,
Tyson.

43:52.658 --> 43:55.761
I want to see you take one,

43:55.794 --> 43:58.997
and I want you to promise me

43:59.031 --> 44:02.067
you will always
have this with you

44:02.100 --> 44:03.368
and take it daily.

44:03.402 --> 44:05.337
You can come to me
for the refills

44:05.370 --> 44:07.272
at no charge.

44:10.375 --> 44:12.444
I promise.

44:15.280 --> 44:17.316
That's a good boy.

44:19.184 --> 44:21.620
Now, let me examine you
a little closer

44:21.653 --> 44:23.989
now that you're awake.

44:29.127 --> 44:32.564
You have the most
beautiful eyes, Julie.

44:32.598 --> 44:35.400
Well, thank you, Tyson.

44:35.434 --> 44:41.139
They say the eyes
are the windows of the soul.

44:41.173 --> 44:42.474
If that's true,

44:42.508 --> 44:45.310
I don't even know
if my mom has a soul.

44:45.344 --> 44:48.113
She can't even look at me
in the eyes.

44:48.146 --> 44:50.782
Yes, I've met your mother.

44:50.816 --> 44:53.585
And I want you to know that

44:53.619 --> 44:56.121
there are people here
that care for you.

44:56.154 --> 44:59.191
We're not all like her.

45:26.853 --> 45:28.654
What do you think you are,

45:28.687 --> 45:31.390
some kind of magic man?

45:31.423 --> 45:34.293
A shaman?

45:34.326 --> 45:35.827
I got this lady in my building

45:35.862 --> 45:37.864
who can tell your future
with tea leaves.

45:37.897 --> 45:40.232
Quiet, please.

45:40.265 --> 45:42.869
It's really important
to clear the space

45:42.902 --> 45:44.837
as we set our intention.

45:53.612 --> 45:55.347
Now what?

45:58.750 --> 46:02.554
I need you to hold my hand
as we set our intention

46:02.588 --> 46:03.388
for finding Lakota.

46:03.422 --> 46:05.257
This better not be
some kinda scam

46:05.290 --> 46:07.125
to try and get me in bed,

46:07.159 --> 46:09.294
or you're in big trouble, buddy.

46:20.639 --> 46:22.374
Close your eyes...

46:25.510 --> 46:29.481
and focus on seeing Lakota
in your mind's eye.

46:34.286 --> 46:36.889
Let the smoke wash over you.

46:45.230 --> 46:47.666
Please help me, Great Creator.

46:47.699 --> 46:49.468
I'm really scared and

46:49.501 --> 46:51.570
I could use
any help I could get.

47:01.613 --> 47:03.482
Neechie?

47:03.515 --> 47:05.717
Lakota, I will find you,
I promise.

47:11.423 --> 47:13.759
I won't let you have her.

47:13.792 --> 47:15.727
And I swear I will find you.

47:22.434 --> 47:23.802
Leave her, brother.

47:23.836 --> 47:25.570
There is nothing you can do now.

47:29.675 --> 47:32.644
Let me out!

47:32.678 --> 47:37.950
Help me!

47:37.984 --> 47:39.751
Wake up!

47:39.785 --> 47:43.588
We have to leave, now!

47:43.622 --> 47:44.622
Derrick.

47:46.291 --> 47:50.830
I'm doing this for 'Kota
and nothing to do with you.

48:01.473 --> 48:03.442
This better have been worth it.

48:03.475 --> 48:06.846
I saw the car
that she was taken in.

48:06.879 --> 48:08.380
And there's a sign that...

48:08.413 --> 48:10.950
This is the manager,
open this door right now!

48:34.673 --> 48:38.878
That was quite the way to get me
out of the vision, Ms. Cardinal.

48:38.911 --> 48:42.781
I guess.

48:42.814 --> 48:47.019
Guess you can call me Lisa.

48:47.053 --> 48:51.490
Just don't be expecting anything
like that again, baby brother.

48:54.493 --> 48:56.896
Quit picking at it already.

48:56.929 --> 49:02.334
I swear I'm spending
half of my time cleaning you up.

49:02.367 --> 49:03.870
Where did all that smoke
come from?

49:03.903 --> 49:07.974
It's a sage bundle
not some freaking bonfire.

49:08.007 --> 49:14.080
It's the first time
I've ever been hurt in a vision.

49:14.113 --> 49:17.917
I was chasing after them
and then...

49:17.950 --> 49:19.551
Run!

49:55.720 --> 49:58.057
Sorry I'm late, come on in.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.036
How are you feeling, Tyson?

50:10.069 --> 50:11.469
Everything good?

50:11.503 --> 50:13.105
You know how it is.

50:13.139 --> 50:14.974
Some good days.

50:15.007 --> 50:17.609
Some not so good days.

50:17.642 --> 50:19.444
Work's been murder.

50:19.477 --> 50:24.449
Are you taking your meds
like we agreed on?

50:24.482 --> 50:26.986
I don't like the way
they make me feel.

50:27.019 --> 50:32.591
I... I see...

50:32.624 --> 50:35.094
see strange things sometimes.

50:35.127 --> 50:39.731
I...

50:39.764 --> 50:41.167
I don't...

50:41.200 --> 50:44.603
I don't think I want to take
them anymore, Dr. Connors.

51:09.061 --> 51:10.830
Tyson.

51:10.863 --> 51:12.430
Tyson?

51:12.464 --> 51:13.598
Are you okay?

51:13.632 --> 51:15.433
It's Julie

51:15.467 --> 51:17.569
and yes you do, mister.

51:17.602 --> 51:19.537
The side effects
are from your brain injury

51:19.571 --> 51:21.007
not the drugs.

51:21.040 --> 51:22.909
Things would be
a lot worse without them.

51:22.942 --> 51:26.913
Trust me, the reason why you
need to keep taking your meds

51:26.946 --> 51:31.918
like we agreed on is this metal
plate in your skull.

51:31.951 --> 51:33.685
Can I get it out?

51:33.718 --> 51:35.922
My skull must've healed by now.

51:35.955 --> 51:39.658
I wish we could
but you know why.

51:39.691 --> 51:42.527
Your bone has grown
around the plate

51:42.560 --> 51:45.898
and it's part of you now.

51:45.932 --> 51:50.870
You mean,
I'm stuck with this thing

51:50.903 --> 51:52.838
inside me forever?

51:52.872 --> 51:56.641
You promised I could get it out
when I was better.

51:56.675 --> 51:58.044
I'm so sorry, Tyson.

51:58.077 --> 52:00.947
There's nothing more
I can do at this point.

52:00.980 --> 52:04.816
I said I would try,
I never promised.

52:04.850 --> 52:07.819
You have made
remarkable progress

52:07.853 --> 52:10.755
for someone who has had
a traumatic injury.

52:10.789 --> 52:13.591
I'm proud of what we have
accomplished together

52:13.625 --> 52:19.065
since the accident.

52:19.098 --> 52:20.665
I come here for help

52:20.699 --> 52:23.102
and now I find out
that the drugs you give me

52:23.135 --> 52:26.005
- don't even work.
- That's not true.

52:26.038 --> 52:28.573
The clinical trials of ketamine
were very promising

52:28.606 --> 52:30.775
on lowering inflammation
of the nervous system.

52:30.809 --> 52:32.244
The last thing you need to do

52:32.278 --> 52:37.083
is develop Parkinson's
or Alzheimer's at your age.

52:39.684 --> 52:41.196
There's something else
you need to know

52:41.220 --> 52:46.859
and I know you're not
going to like hearing this.

52:46.892 --> 52:51.730
The titanium plate has caused
stress shielding on your skull

52:51.763 --> 52:56.002
making the bone underneath
to become very brittle.

52:59.839 --> 53:02.274
I think I should have stayed
home this morning.

53:02.308 --> 53:05.878
Tyson, you're gonna be okay.

53:05.911 --> 53:08.247
But you need to know what
is happening to your body

53:08.280 --> 53:12.051
and not take any
unnecessary risks.

53:15.653 --> 53:18.057
Don't forget the medicine.

53:18.090 --> 53:21.994
It's very important.

53:22.028 --> 53:26.098
I don't think you can help me
anymore, Dr. Connors.

53:26.132 --> 53:28.733
It's Julie.

53:28.767 --> 53:32.238
And please, please be careful.

53:49.889 --> 53:51.790
I can feel you're there,
bastard.

53:57.762 --> 53:59.899
I came to see you.

53:59.932 --> 54:04.636
One last time before tonight.

54:04.669 --> 54:07.206
Does that mean
you're letting me go?

54:13.711 --> 54:15.915
Why are you doing this?

54:15.948 --> 54:17.883
I just don't get it.

54:17.917 --> 54:20.819
Please, help me to understand.

54:20.853 --> 54:22.720
I don't even know your name,
I'm...

54:22.754 --> 54:27.193
It doesn't matter who you are.

54:27.226 --> 54:29.995
When the moon is full...

54:30.029 --> 54:31.964
the pain...

54:31.997 --> 54:35.267
will go away.

54:35.301 --> 54:37.069
Is tonight a full moon?

54:37.103 --> 54:42.241
That's when I stop you
from hurting me.

54:42.274 --> 54:46.178
I need to get back
to my brother and grandmother.

54:46.212 --> 54:49.215
Please, please let me go.

54:49.248 --> 54:53.986
You don't have to do this.

54:54.019 --> 54:58.124
I'll do anything you want,
just let me leave!

54:58.157 --> 55:01.693
My family needs me.

55:01.726 --> 55:03.395
Doesn't your family need you?

55:08.700 --> 55:10.668
Ty I feel terrible
for what happened

55:10.702 --> 55:12.438
and I want to
make things better.

55:12.471 --> 55:17.775
I just want to go lie down
in my room.

55:17.809 --> 55:22.680
- Where's Charlie?
- He's out for a while.

55:22.714 --> 55:24.283
Come on, honey.

55:24.316 --> 55:30.156
There's something
I want to show you.

56:08.527 --> 56:11.030
Tigger.

56:14.833 --> 56:18.270
My old friend.

56:18.304 --> 56:21.106
Do you know how close
you came to the end?

56:27.980 --> 56:30.349
The closest thing to family
I have left.

57:19.031 --> 57:22.301
Lakota I'm failing
but I'm not stopping

57:22.334 --> 57:25.037
until I find you.

57:57.603 --> 57:59.038
Go back to the reservation!

57:59.071 --> 58:02.941
Why don't you screw your cousin,
redneck!

58:06.045 --> 58:11.050
Yeah you better run, savage!

58:15.187 --> 58:18.957
♪ I've been running
for so long ♪

58:18.991 --> 58:22.194
♪ Please tell me where I am? ♪

58:28.033 --> 58:31.470
♪ All I remember ♪

58:31.503 --> 58:34.073
♪ Is once I was... ♪

58:40.412 --> 58:43.582
Enjoying the early evening air?

58:43.615 --> 58:46.385
Um, not really.

58:46.418 --> 58:51.056
I'm lost, really tired
and really thirsty.

58:51.090 --> 58:53.492
You don't happen to have
any water, do you?

58:53.525 --> 58:55.094
I sure do, son.

58:55.127 --> 58:56.095
Why don't you get
in the back seat

58:56.128 --> 58:59.965
and we'll see what we can do.

59:07.706 --> 59:12.378
I'll put it in the trunk
for safe keeping.

59:18.250 --> 59:23.489
So, Chief, what brings you
off the reserve today?

59:23.522 --> 59:27.693
Reserve?
I'm out for a walk from town.

59:27.726 --> 59:29.661
I'm looking for
a friend of mine.

59:29.695 --> 59:33.065
Maybe you know him?
Detective George Karras.

59:33.098 --> 59:34.400
Never heard of him.

59:34.433 --> 59:36.201
Why don't you start
with giving us some ID

59:36.235 --> 59:38.470
and telling us just
what you're doing out here.

59:38.504 --> 59:41.073
No one ever comes out here
except for Walter Crabtree

59:41.106 --> 59:43.184
- who lives a few miles back.
- And the convicts from

59:43.208 --> 59:46.578
the reserve who like to
terrorize the community.

59:46.612 --> 59:51.550
You know, I must've left
my ID with my friend.

59:51.583 --> 59:53.585
Detective Karras.

59:53.619 --> 59:55.053
Are you sure you don't know him?

59:55.087 --> 59:57.289
- He's at my...
- Cut the shit, son.

59:57.322 --> 59:59.134
We arrested your girlfriend
earlier this morning

59:59.158 --> 1:00:01.727
at the motel, you know,
using a stolen credit card

1:00:01.760 --> 1:00:04.997
is a federal offense
and arson is too.

1:00:05.030 --> 1:00:06.698
What's your name?

1:00:06.732 --> 1:00:08.567
I'm Derrick Desjardins.

1:00:08.600 --> 1:00:10.068
I don't even have a credit card.

1:00:10.102 --> 1:00:12.571
I'm only 17.

1:00:12.604 --> 1:00:14.039
I'll see what I can do.

1:00:14.072 --> 1:00:16.675
There just might be
a way out of this.

1:00:26.452 --> 1:00:29.188
This is quite the list
of charges against you.

1:00:29.221 --> 1:00:31.390
If we bring you in
and throw the book at you.

1:00:31.423 --> 1:00:34.059
Which we will, you won't be
seeing your family

1:00:34.092 --> 1:00:38.163
- for a very long, long while.
- No please.

1:00:38.197 --> 1:00:40.199
I have to get out of here
right now.

1:00:40.232 --> 1:00:43.535
My sister's in real trouble
and she does not have much time.

1:00:43.569 --> 1:00:47.339
Do either of you know a guy with
a cowboy hat in a black car?

1:00:49.374 --> 1:00:50.685
You just narrowed it down
to about half the guys

1:00:50.709 --> 1:00:53.579
that live around here,
what's this all about?

1:00:53.612 --> 1:00:55.747
He's holding my sister
in a cellar prison

1:00:55.781 --> 1:00:58.116
off Snake Pass Crescent.

1:00:58.150 --> 1:00:59.685
You have to help me find her.

1:00:59.718 --> 1:01:01.253
Please.

1:01:05.123 --> 1:01:07.226
We don't have to do shit.

1:01:07.259 --> 1:01:09.595
- Wait but I...
- You lied to us, right?

1:01:09.628 --> 1:01:11.372
Yeah, you've been lying to us
the entire time

1:01:11.396 --> 1:01:15.634
you've been in the car,
what makes this different?

1:01:15.667 --> 1:01:17.779
If I had a way out of this
for you that doesn't include

1:01:17.803 --> 1:01:20.105
getting arrested
or going to jail

1:01:20.138 --> 1:01:22.508
- would you be interested?
- Yeah, thank you, sir.

1:01:22.541 --> 1:01:24.576
Where do I sign up?

1:01:50.168 --> 1:01:51.537
This is it.

1:01:51.570 --> 1:01:53.672
Here is your chance
to escape all the charges

1:01:53.705 --> 1:01:56.475
and go find your sister.

1:01:56.508 --> 1:02:01.113
Thanks, officer, you know,
I do appreciate it but...

1:02:01.146 --> 1:02:03.682
I don't know
where I am right now.

1:02:03.715 --> 1:02:05.617
At the end of the line.

1:02:05.651 --> 1:02:09.221
Or do you want to spend the next
few years in the penitentiary?

1:02:09.254 --> 1:02:12.658
I'm sure the convicts would love
a cute thing like you.

1:02:12.691 --> 1:02:16.662
Yeah, yeah, no,
right here works for me fine.

1:02:16.695 --> 1:02:18.330
Can I get out now please?

1:02:36.448 --> 1:02:40.085
Can I have my guitar back
please, sir?

1:02:52.899 --> 1:02:55.300
Why would you do that?

1:03:00.706 --> 1:03:02.741
Well, now you've got something
to keep you warm.

1:03:02.774 --> 1:03:05.344
It gets mighty cold here
at night.

1:03:05.377 --> 1:03:08.747
Now you've got some firewood.

1:03:08.780 --> 1:03:12.351
Tonto.

1:03:12.384 --> 1:03:13.418
Tonto.

1:03:19.524 --> 1:03:20.524
Tonto!

1:03:58.563 --> 1:04:01.667
Excuse me?

1:04:01.700 --> 1:04:02.911
Is there anything
I can help you with?

1:04:02.935 --> 1:04:04.636
Yeah, I just came from up north.

1:04:04.670 --> 1:04:07.472
I'm tracking two perps that
may have come through town.

1:04:12.778 --> 1:04:14.312
From the big city, eh?

1:04:14.346 --> 1:04:16.381
We don't get much
of anyone from up there.

1:04:16.415 --> 1:04:18.316
What can I help you with,
Detective?

1:04:18.350 --> 1:04:19.919
The two individuals in question

1:04:19.952 --> 1:04:21.520
were stating at the Vista Motel.

1:04:21.553 --> 1:04:23.956
It's a teenage boy
and a young woman in her 20s.

1:04:23.990 --> 1:04:25.557
Both of aboriginal decent.

1:04:25.590 --> 1:04:27.426
Hi here, I'm Staff Sergeant
Lintinsky

1:04:27.459 --> 1:04:29.494
and run this station,
you mentioned you're looking

1:04:29.528 --> 1:04:31.563
for someone,
did you need to file

1:04:31.596 --> 1:04:32.865
a missing's persons report

1:04:32.899 --> 1:04:34.299
or put out an APB?

1:04:34.332 --> 1:04:37.602
No, no, Detective George Karras.

1:04:37.636 --> 1:04:39.839
The clerk at the motel told me
that one of my suspects

1:04:39.872 --> 1:04:42.574
may have been picked up by
police earlier this morning.

1:04:42.607 --> 1:04:44.476
We didn't pick up anyone
early this morning.

1:04:44.509 --> 1:04:46.846
Constable,
can you give me a minute

1:04:46.879 --> 1:04:48.848
with the detective please?

1:04:52.684 --> 1:04:54.462
Koontz is a good soldier
but doesn't do so well

1:04:54.486 --> 1:04:55.922
with out of towners.

1:04:55.955 --> 1:04:57.465
I don't even think
he's ever been farther

1:04:57.489 --> 1:04:59.725
than 100 miles from home
in his whole life.

1:04:59.758 --> 1:05:00.993
Yeah, I know the type.

1:05:01.027 --> 1:05:06.331
My guess is he hasn't even been
in uniform for a year, right?

1:05:06.364 --> 1:05:09.301
- I'll buzz you in.
- Thanks.

1:05:14.706 --> 1:05:18.443
Rookies always got something
to prove, huh?

1:05:18.477 --> 1:05:20.479
You're far more right
than you know, detective.

1:05:20.512 --> 1:05:22.814
Now getting back
to the matter at hand.

1:05:22.849 --> 1:05:25.584
Do you have names and physical
descriptions of the perps?

1:05:25.617 --> 1:05:27.019
Yes.

1:05:27.053 --> 1:05:29.588
Here's the spelling
of the names.

1:05:33.692 --> 1:05:34.894
Let's see.

1:05:34.927 --> 1:05:38.630
Lisa Cardinal.

1:05:38.663 --> 1:05:41.633
Looks like your first perp
has a wrap sheet a mile long.

1:05:41.666 --> 1:05:43.045
Ms. Cardinal has been
involved with crime

1:05:43.069 --> 1:05:44.636
since she was 13.

1:05:44.669 --> 1:05:46.309
I can't wait to see
what we find out about

1:05:46.338 --> 1:05:48.908
this Derrick Desjardins
character.

1:05:52.979 --> 1:05:54.412
This is odd.

1:05:54.446 --> 1:05:56.515
All I can find is his address,

1:05:56.548 --> 1:05:59.051
school, date of birth,
next of kin,

1:05:59.085 --> 1:06:00.519
buying habits,
cell phone records

1:06:00.552 --> 1:06:02.788
but nothing criminal.

1:06:02.821 --> 1:06:04.790
That's very odd indeed.

1:06:04.823 --> 1:06:07.325
I have reason to believe
that she's holding him

1:06:07.359 --> 1:06:08.660
against his will.

1:06:08.693 --> 1:06:10.695
She's a very troubled
young woman.

1:06:10.729 --> 1:06:15.001
She brings everybody down
around her.

1:06:15.034 --> 1:06:18.737
Look, Derrick's a good kid.

1:06:18.770 --> 1:06:20.372
You know?

1:06:20.405 --> 1:06:23.075
He just got wrapped up
with a dangerous woman.

1:06:23.109 --> 1:06:24.844
We were young once, right?

1:06:24.877 --> 1:06:26.846
- Stupid.
- Yeah.

1:06:26.879 --> 1:06:29.681
I remember.

1:06:29.714 --> 1:06:33.052
The things I did
for a piece of tail.

1:06:37.522 --> 1:06:38.766
So I'm going to escort
the Cardinal

1:06:38.790 --> 1:06:42.094
back to the Reman Center where
she'll be held before court.

1:06:42.128 --> 1:06:44.831
She's going to have to answer
to a list of charges

1:06:44.864 --> 1:06:47.432
a mile long.

1:06:47.465 --> 1:06:49.101
We picked her up this morning.

1:06:49.135 --> 1:06:50.602
She's in the back
held on charges

1:06:50.635 --> 1:06:53.738
of credit card fraud and arson.

1:06:53.772 --> 1:06:55.507
I don't know what the hell
to do with her.

1:06:55.540 --> 1:06:56.617
We're a two person
police station

1:06:56.641 --> 1:07:00.980
with one holding cell.

1:07:01.013 --> 1:07:03.748
Koontz, take Ms. Cardinal
out of her cell

1:07:03.782 --> 1:07:06.551
and accompany her to
the front of the station.

1:07:14.526 --> 1:07:18.130
Today's your lucky day,
Cardinal.

1:07:18.164 --> 1:07:22.068
There's a detective here
to take you back to the city.

1:07:22.101 --> 1:07:24.469
I wouldn't try anything stupid.

1:07:24.502 --> 1:07:28.440
Back against the wall.

1:07:28.473 --> 1:07:30.742
That's good Private Cuntz.

1:07:30.775 --> 1:07:35.081
I couldn't stand another minute
in your shitty little town.

1:07:35.114 --> 1:07:37.884
That's...

1:07:37.917 --> 1:07:44.723
Constable
and it's pronounced Koontz.

1:07:50.062 --> 1:07:53.531
You sure do remind me of those
saucy little squaws

1:07:53.565 --> 1:07:57.970
from the reserve.

1:07:58.004 --> 1:08:00.006
Yes indeed.

1:08:00.039 --> 1:08:02.440
What the hell is going on
back there?

1:08:02.474 --> 1:08:04.676
Get Ms. Cardinal up here
toots sweet.

1:08:04.709 --> 1:08:06.811
Detective Karras has to get
her up to the big city.

1:08:06.846 --> 1:08:09.181
- Now!
- Next time I see you

1:08:09.215 --> 1:08:11.783
I'm going to split you in two.

1:08:11.816 --> 1:08:13.920
Yeah, I'll be right there boss.

1:08:13.953 --> 1:08:19.125
I just had to straighten
something out with our guest.

1:08:19.158 --> 1:08:21.793
You'll keep your mouth shut if
you know what's good for you.

1:08:27.699 --> 1:08:29.668
I don't think you can
paint all of the kids

1:08:29.701 --> 1:08:31.938
from the reservation
with the same brush.

1:08:31.971 --> 1:08:33.505
Bullshit I can't.

1:08:33.538 --> 1:08:34.983
They think they're some
kind of OG gangsters

1:08:35.007 --> 1:08:37.642
with their wrap crap
and are constantly stealing

1:08:37.676 --> 1:08:39.946
from the farms around here,
driving around stone

1:08:39.979 --> 1:08:42.248
with unregistered firearms
and causing trouble.

1:08:42.281 --> 1:08:45.583
They think they're Black
and from the slums of America.

1:08:45.617 --> 1:08:48.820
These kids have lost
their way and have no idea

1:08:48.854 --> 1:08:50.089
who they are.

1:08:50.122 --> 1:08:52.691
I blame their parents, myself.

1:08:52.724 --> 1:08:54.860
In fact, sure does remind me
of those low-lifes

1:08:54.894 --> 1:08:57.964
from the Red Fish Reserve,
yes indeed.

1:08:57.997 --> 1:09:02.068
Except I'm from E-Town
and I ain't a low-life.

1:09:02.101 --> 1:09:04.203
Save the lies for the court
there, sweetie.

1:09:04.236 --> 1:09:07.039
Yeah, okay, thank you very much
Sergeant.

1:09:07.073 --> 1:09:08.874
Come on.

1:09:08.908 --> 1:09:11.210
Have a pleasant evening,
Ms. Cardinal.

1:09:21.053 --> 1:09:23.956
You don't think they're going to
look for the boy, do you?

1:09:23.990 --> 1:09:27.792
Who cares? We dropped the bunk
off deep in Crownland,

1:09:27.826 --> 1:09:30.029
no one's going to find him.

1:09:43.142 --> 1:09:44.809
Georgie.

1:09:44.844 --> 1:09:46.879
Can we get out of here
so I can get these off?

1:09:46.912 --> 1:09:48.613
- Like right now?
- The only reason

1:09:48.646 --> 1:09:50.249
they mentioned Derrick was
because

1:09:50.282 --> 1:09:53.052
of the criminal background
check.

1:09:53.085 --> 1:09:54.619
They weren't even
going to tell me

1:09:54.652 --> 1:09:57.023
that you were
in the back either.

1:09:57.056 --> 1:09:58.224
Wow.

1:09:58.257 --> 1:10:00.759
They're real charmers.

1:10:00.792 --> 1:10:02.794
Please, can we go?

1:10:02.827 --> 1:10:04.763
This place gives me the creeps.

1:10:04.796 --> 1:10:07.199
Something fierce.

1:10:07.233 --> 1:10:09.634
Why couldn't you just stay put?

1:10:09.667 --> 1:10:12.171
You went and you
fucked everything up.

1:10:12.204 --> 1:10:16.674
Oh-ho, swear word
from our boy in blue.

1:10:16.708 --> 1:10:18.844
Where's the cop cavalcade
promised?

1:10:18.878 --> 1:10:21.080
Well, the inspector said
that she needed more hard proof

1:10:21.113 --> 1:10:24.283
before she assigned
more officers.

1:10:24.316 --> 1:10:27.619
If they listened to me.

1:10:27.652 --> 1:10:30.622
Here.

1:10:30.655 --> 1:10:33.792
All of these red x's represent
where people went missing

1:10:33.825 --> 1:10:36.694
and it starts just
down the road from here.

1:10:36.728 --> 1:10:40.698
The usual stellar detective work
I've come to expect.

1:10:40.732 --> 1:10:42.234
We should find 'Kota in no time.

1:10:42.268 --> 1:10:45.237
It's not just women
that go missing here, Cardinal.

1:10:45.271 --> 1:10:47.940
Men go missing here too.

1:10:47.973 --> 1:10:50.843
Mostly from the reserve but...

1:10:50.876 --> 1:10:52.811
no one cares about
a bunch of Indian hookers

1:10:52.845 --> 1:10:55.281
- and town drunks.
- You think those pigs have

1:10:55.314 --> 1:10:56.949
something to do with it,
don't you?

1:10:56.982 --> 1:10:58.683
I don't have any hard proof,
but everything

1:10:58.716 --> 1:11:02.654
in my gut says yeah, they do.

1:11:02.687 --> 1:11:07.226
Look, I'd bet my badge that
they did something to Derrick.

1:11:07.259 --> 1:11:08.527
Maybe Lakota too.

1:11:08.561 --> 1:11:12.231
Then let's get the hell out of
here and start looking for them.

1:11:12.264 --> 1:11:13.833
Yeah.

1:11:13.866 --> 1:11:18.237
The highway will give us
a clue, it's got to.

1:11:27.745 --> 1:11:30.382
Ugh! Ugh!

1:11:34.286 --> 1:11:37.123
When I get out here I'm going to
kill both of you!

1:11:44.796 --> 1:11:48.400
You aren't even human!

1:11:48.434 --> 1:11:49.801
Ugh!

1:11:49.835 --> 1:11:51.736
Oh you deserve to die.

1:12:02.081 --> 1:12:05.184
No, but not me.

1:12:05.851 --> 1:12:08.387
No, I don't want to die.

1:12:08.420 --> 1:12:10.156
No I don't.

1:12:17.329 --> 1:12:21.300
I have to save Lakota.

1:12:23.903 --> 1:12:25.237
Who's there?

1:12:44.223 --> 1:12:47.792
Get off your ass boy
and stand like a man.

1:12:47.825 --> 1:12:51.130
Wait, who's there?

1:12:51.163 --> 1:12:54.867
I am Mahikhan
and I have come to help you.

1:12:54.900 --> 1:12:58.770
You have seen me before,
Derrick Desjardins.

1:12:58.803 --> 1:13:03.042
You're from my vision.

1:13:03.075 --> 1:13:04.410
I must be dead or dreaming.

1:13:04.443 --> 1:13:08.914
You're not dead yet
but Lakota is in extreme danger

1:13:08.948 --> 1:13:11.317
and it is up to you to save her.

1:13:11.350 --> 1:13:14.153
I could've saved her
if you would've stopped me.

1:13:14.186 --> 1:13:16.889
It is very dangerous
to enter the real world

1:13:16.922 --> 1:13:21.360
when you are in a vision.

1:13:21.393 --> 1:13:23.095
I'm not scared
of breaking through it

1:13:23.128 --> 1:13:26.098
- if it means saving my sister.
- You should be.

1:13:26.131 --> 1:13:29.235
You would be trapped between the
shadow world and yours forever.

1:13:29.268 --> 1:13:31.870
But now it is time to take
control of your reality

1:13:31.904 --> 1:13:33.872
and save Lakota.

1:13:33.906 --> 1:13:36.075
I... I don't know where to go.

1:13:36.108 --> 1:13:38.776
Abandoned in the middle
of nowhere

1:13:38.810 --> 1:13:41.213
by the police
who want me to die, I...

1:13:41.247 --> 1:13:45.317
Being a victim is getting
really old really fast, boy.

1:13:45.351 --> 1:13:47.519
What you need is to start acting
like the man

1:13:47.553 --> 1:13:48.887
you were meant to be.

1:13:48.921 --> 1:13:51.457
You must lead and save Lakota.

1:13:51.490 --> 1:13:52.824
Well, can you help me?

1:13:52.858 --> 1:13:54.393
I don't know where to start.

1:13:54.426 --> 1:13:55.961
Follow the moon.

1:13:55.995 --> 1:13:57.863
You know the sign to look for.

1:13:57.896 --> 1:13:59.498
The hunter is very close

1:13:59.531 --> 1:14:02.935
and you don't have much time.

1:14:02.968 --> 1:14:05.938
I know I may not
make it out of there

1:14:05.971 --> 1:14:09.475
but if I can stop those killings

1:14:09.508 --> 1:14:11.010
it will be worth my life.

1:14:11.043 --> 1:14:14.812
Now that is a man
speaking to me.

1:14:14.847 --> 1:14:17.483
W... wait!

1:14:17.516 --> 1:14:19.817
What am I supposed to do
when I find him?

1:14:19.852 --> 1:14:24.456
Save your sister and don't die.

1:14:24.490 --> 1:14:27.293
Don't die.

1:14:27.326 --> 1:14:30.062
Good advice.

1:14:42.141 --> 1:14:43.575
Christ's sake, don't you think

1:14:43.609 --> 1:14:45.577
you can get these handcuffs off.

1:14:45.611 --> 1:14:49.181
Yeah that is
not going to happen.

1:14:49.214 --> 1:14:50.592
Look, I've got enough problems
without you

1:14:50.616 --> 1:14:55.921
running around unchained.

1:14:55.954 --> 1:14:58.924
How the hell did you
start a fire in a motel?

1:14:58.957 --> 1:15:02.027
Yeah, no,
we'll deal with that later.

1:15:02.061 --> 1:15:05.364
Why didn't you stay in the city
when I asked you to?

1:15:05.397 --> 1:15:08.300
You cost us hours
that we don't have, Cardinal.

1:15:12.604 --> 1:15:16.942
Why weren't you there
when I needed you, Georgie?

1:15:16.975 --> 1:15:19.945
You promised me
you'd be there for us.

1:15:19.978 --> 1:15:22.281
I lost Danielle cause of you.

1:15:22.314 --> 1:15:25.517
They still haven't found
her body.

1:15:25.551 --> 1:15:29.888
She was my friend.

1:15:29.922 --> 1:15:32.591
I didn't know.

1:15:32.624 --> 1:15:35.127
Got to find Lakota too,
I can't have another woman's

1:15:35.160 --> 1:15:38.097
blood on my hands,
I'm just trying to help.

1:15:38.130 --> 1:15:41.233
So you want to help,
do you, Georgie?

1:15:41.266 --> 1:15:44.036
You were there
for my gang all right.

1:15:44.069 --> 1:15:48.240
Just like that, we were gone.

1:15:48.273 --> 1:15:50.943
I lost two of my girls
after you left.

1:15:50.976 --> 1:15:53.412
Left? Really?

1:15:53.445 --> 1:15:55.247
We've been hunting down
a murderer that's been

1:15:55.280 --> 1:15:57.583
abducting women
off these streets for ten years

1:15:57.616 --> 1:15:59.218
and you think I just leave?

1:15:59.251 --> 1:16:03.021
That wasn't the word
on the street.

1:16:03.055 --> 1:16:04.456
- I heard...
- Look, I don't know

1:16:04.490 --> 1:16:07.993
what happened, all I know
is I had everything set up

1:16:08.026 --> 1:16:09.995
with my men in place
and you showed up

1:16:10.028 --> 1:16:12.664
and you spooked them.
You spooked everybody.

1:16:12.698 --> 1:16:15.000
You spooked my guys
and the suspect.

1:16:15.033 --> 1:16:16.277
So you thought
I should just stand there

1:16:16.301 --> 1:16:18.170
and wait for my girl
to get killed?

1:16:18.203 --> 1:16:21.273
No, I just needed you
to stay put

1:16:21.306 --> 1:16:23.308
until we found our suspect.

1:16:28.680 --> 1:16:34.019
The investigator blames me
for blowing the case.

1:16:34.052 --> 1:16:35.263
He pulled me off the street
and sent me

1:16:35.287 --> 1:16:39.591
into Saint Josephs
for safe keeping.

1:16:39.625 --> 1:16:43.262
I blamed you for everything.

1:16:43.295 --> 1:16:46.331
After my divorce I just...

1:16:46.365 --> 1:16:48.233
I realized that
I'm the one that's responsible

1:16:48.267 --> 1:16:50.369
for everything
that happens to me.

1:16:55.073 --> 1:16:57.476
I'm sorry.

1:16:57.509 --> 1:16:58.677
From the bottom of my heart

1:16:58.710 --> 1:17:00.579
I am sorry, Lisa.

1:17:00.612 --> 1:17:03.382
I should've told you
that we were there to set up...

1:17:03.415 --> 1:17:05.717
Georgie watch out!

1:17:19.631 --> 1:17:25.003
I'd love to help you sweetie
but I have to save my sister.

1:17:25.037 --> 1:17:27.206
I don't have time.

1:17:27.239 --> 1:17:29.475
But I promise I'll be back
as soon as I can, okay?

1:17:31.510 --> 1:17:32.711
Okay.

1:17:36.815 --> 1:17:38.717
Fuck it.

1:17:38.750 --> 1:17:41.787
I'm saving you, my sister

1:17:41.820 --> 1:17:44.356
and whoever else I can, okay?

1:17:44.389 --> 1:17:46.258
All right.

1:17:47.726 --> 1:17:49.561
Is anyone there?

1:17:55.267 --> 1:17:56.502
Georgie!

1:17:56.535 --> 1:17:57.469
Georgie, are you okay?

1:17:57.503 --> 1:18:04.510
It's Officer Karras
and no, not really.

1:18:04.543 --> 1:18:06.678
Ugh.

1:18:06.712 --> 1:18:09.348
Desjardins.

1:18:09.381 --> 1:18:13.385
Why did you disobey
my direct order to stay put?

1:18:15.153 --> 1:18:19.458
I need to save my sister.

1:18:19.491 --> 1:18:22.461
Officer Karras,
this is really important.

1:18:22.494 --> 1:18:25.130
Where's Lisa, I need her help

1:18:25.163 --> 1:18:27.599
and I'm almost out of time!

1:18:27.633 --> 1:18:30.068
She's okay.

1:18:30.102 --> 1:18:35.073
I bailed her out and then...

1:18:35.107 --> 1:18:38.744
And then what? Where is she?

1:18:42.514 --> 1:18:46.451
Stay.

1:18:46.485 --> 1:18:48.820
I'll be back
for the both of you.

1:18:48.855 --> 1:18:51.223
I promise.

1:18:55.827 --> 1:18:57.296
Oh, Lisa.

1:18:59.631 --> 1:19:00.799
Lisa.

1:19:00.833 --> 1:19:02.334
Lisa.

1:19:05.337 --> 1:19:07.874
Lisa, please wake up, please.

1:19:07.907 --> 1:19:09.341
Lakota needs you.

1:19:13.913 --> 1:19:15.747
God.

1:19:15.781 --> 1:19:18.483
Please let this be
a bad dream or something.

1:19:23.689 --> 1:19:29.361
I wish I could have saved you.

1:19:29.394 --> 1:19:34.299
Like in the movies
and we could...

1:19:34.333 --> 1:19:36.668
we could've had
a happy ending together but...

1:19:42.341 --> 1:19:46.311
We all know that's not
going to happen.

1:19:52.551 --> 1:19:55.520
I'm so sorry.

1:19:55.554 --> 1:19:58.891
For not being there
for you when you needed me.

1:20:46.906 --> 1:20:48.774
Goodbye Ms. Cardinal.

1:22:11.090 --> 1:22:16.561
Now it's time to cleanse
the world and stop the pain.

1:22:18.530 --> 1:22:22.567
One whore at a time.

1:22:22.601 --> 1:22:23.836
Ah!

1:22:25.537 --> 1:22:28.673
Ah!

1:22:44.924 --> 1:22:46.859
You're insane, let me go.

1:22:52.664 --> 1:22:58.637
This is all you wanted,
all you had to do was ask, boy.

1:22:58.670 --> 1:23:01.807
Get off my sister,
you son of a bitch!

1:23:01.841 --> 1:23:04.844
Lakota, get out of here!

1:23:04.877 --> 1:23:06.946
Fuck that!

1:23:06.979 --> 1:23:08.346
He's got this shit coming.

1:23:26.132 --> 1:23:28.835
You don't have to do this.

1:23:28.868 --> 1:23:30.069
Oh no.

1:23:34.706 --> 1:23:38.743
It's almost over, can you feel
it, you sick son of a bitch?

1:23:38.777 --> 1:23:41.981
Me and my brother,
we're going to get you.

1:23:42.014 --> 1:23:46.484
Not until I've had it my way.

1:23:46.518 --> 1:23:52.624
The pain will end with you.

1:23:52.657 --> 1:23:53.926
Mother.

1:25:16.842 --> 1:25:18.911
Lakota, hang on!

1:25:18.945 --> 1:25:21.680
I'm coming!

1:25:30.822 --> 1:25:32.224
No!

1:25:42.268 --> 1:25:44.971
It's time, boy.

1:25:45.004 --> 1:25:48.640
Time for you to join
the whore in her watery grave.

1:25:59.151 --> 1:26:00.819
Ah!

1:26:11.063 --> 1:26:14.000
Ah!

1:26:31.616 --> 1:26:33.119
It's caused stressed healing

1:26:33.152 --> 1:26:36.288
making the bone underneath
to become very brittle.

1:26:39.791 --> 1:26:42.294
Up.

1:26:46.332 --> 1:26:48.134
Ugh!

1:26:50.269 --> 1:26:51.937
Ugh!

1:27:13.926 --> 1:27:17.329
Lakota! Lakota!

1:27:17.363 --> 1:27:18.931
Lakota!

1:27:18.964 --> 1:27:21.033
Oh no.

1:27:21.067 --> 1:27:24.236
Come on, come on.

1:27:27.940 --> 1:27:29.375
No, no.

1:27:29.408 --> 1:27:34.046
God if I have to give my last
breath to save you I will.

1:27:42.254 --> 1:27:43.822
Jesus, if you weren't my brother

1:27:43.856 --> 1:27:46.292
I'd kill you
for touching me like that!

1:27:46.325 --> 1:27:48.961
I'm so glad that you're okay.

1:27:48.994 --> 1:27:51.897
You're still
a pain in my ass though.

1:27:53.798 --> 1:27:56.135
I love you more than you know,
neechie.

1:27:56.168 --> 1:27:57.203
Thank you.

1:27:57.236 --> 1:27:58.838
Stop right there.

1:27:58.871 --> 1:28:01.639
Put your hands
where I can see them.

1:28:01.673 --> 1:28:04.977
Get away from her, step back.

1:28:05.010 --> 1:28:06.687
Been investigating
the Road of Tears for years,

1:28:06.711 --> 1:28:08.680
looks like I finally
got my big break.

1:28:08.713 --> 1:28:10.682
I found that car
that you ran off the road.

1:28:10.715 --> 1:28:13.252
What? No you're going
to kill her too?

1:28:13.285 --> 1:28:16.255
That dead girl in the ditch
beside the car,

1:28:16.288 --> 1:28:18.057
that's the end of the line.

1:28:18.090 --> 1:28:21.193
Dead girl?

1:28:21.227 --> 1:28:25.064
Lisa didn't make it.

1:28:25.097 --> 1:28:26.999
I tried saving everyone.

1:28:31.803 --> 1:28:34.806
You better start talking quick.

1:28:34.840 --> 1:28:40.146
I came here to save my sister,
Lakota, okay.

1:28:40.179 --> 1:28:45.217
And that dead girl, the woman
you found in the ditch?

1:28:45.251 --> 1:28:48.087
Yeah, her name was Lisa Cardinal

1:28:48.120 --> 1:28:52.424
and she was our friend.

1:28:52.458 --> 1:28:56.162
Oh Jesus this remind me
of Rawanda.

1:28:56.195 --> 1:28:59.431
Someone's been a busy boy,
where the hell is he?

1:29:06.005 --> 1:29:08.806
It's Symenko,
I need a full forensic team.

1:29:08.841 --> 1:29:10.318
I'm going to need divers
to comb the lake.

1:29:10.342 --> 1:29:12.777
I need air support,
just whatever you can spare.

1:29:12.810 --> 1:29:14.180
There's a lot of bodies
out here.

1:29:14.213 --> 1:29:17.749
Excuse me officers,
can we put our arms down now?

1:29:17.782 --> 1:29:20.119
Lower your weapon.

1:29:20.152 --> 1:29:21.854
Hold on, you better
get that looked at.

1:29:21.887 --> 1:29:25.324
You lost a lot of blood.

1:29:25.357 --> 1:29:27.126
I need an ambulance
down here right away.

1:29:27.159 --> 1:29:29.862
- Don't die on me!
- We got a man going into shock.

1:29:30.863 --> 1:29:35.000
Make it happen.

1:29:44.043 --> 1:29:46.378
There he is,
the hero of the hour.

1:29:46.412 --> 1:29:48.881
We came as soon as we heard.

1:29:48.914 --> 1:29:50.482
How are you feeling?

1:29:50.516 --> 1:29:52.952
The doctor said
you lost so much blood.

1:29:52.985 --> 1:29:56.355
Uh, no, I'm okay.

1:29:56.388 --> 1:29:59.391
I'm better than the other guy,
that's for sure.

1:29:59.425 --> 1:30:01.961
How are you, Kôhkom?

1:30:01.994 --> 1:30:04.997
You know, I was pretty scared
when you left.

1:30:05.030 --> 1:30:07.466
It was touch and go for a while

1:30:07.499 --> 1:30:10.102
but Ogichidaa, the medicine man,

1:30:10.135 --> 1:30:12.338
was able to draw out
my sickness.

1:30:12.371 --> 1:30:16.242
I'm much better now.

1:30:16.275 --> 1:30:17.843
A gift.

1:30:17.876 --> 1:30:20.913
To replace the one
you lost in battle.

1:30:20.946 --> 1:30:22.982
How do you know what happened?

1:30:23.015 --> 1:30:26.085
I can see many things.
I can teach you too.

1:30:26.118 --> 1:30:28.854
Not until the doctor
says he can leave.

1:30:28.887 --> 1:30:30.389
Of course, there will be things

1:30:30.422 --> 1:30:31.991
we gotta take care of first.

1:30:32.024 --> 1:30:33.959
You ready for the red path?

1:30:33.993 --> 1:30:36.262
Keeper of the fire.

1:30:36.295 --> 1:30:39.531
Ogimaa...

1:30:39.565 --> 1:30:41.934
any offer of help
is appreciated.

1:30:41.967 --> 1:30:45.237
Accepting help is an excellent
first step to healing.

1:30:48.507 --> 1:30:50.843
I was so scared for you Lakota.

1:30:50.876 --> 1:30:54.113
I thought I might
never see you again.

1:30:54.146 --> 1:30:58.584
Like a bad penny,
I just keep coming back.

1:30:58.617 --> 1:31:00.386
I'm so sorry, Kôhkom.

1:31:03.522 --> 1:31:06.558
It's okay, noozhishenh.

1:31:06.592 --> 1:31:10.296
We're a family again.

1:31:10.329 --> 1:31:12.031
Whole once more.
