08:15.203 --> 08:19.036

-Three days is the best l can do.

12:44.141 --> 12:48.339

14:59.444 --> 15:02.471
-They won't do it again.
-They never listen!

15:02.647 --> 15:04.706

-How could you let them do that to her?
-Do what?

15:25.504 --> 15:28.837

-She tried to crawl out of bed.

15:29.007 --> 15:32.875

15:45.458 --> 15:47.755
Peter, she needs to be restrained.

15:51.830 --> 15:54.355
And take a deep breath.

And let it out.

15:58.704 --> 16:02.196
-Does that hurt?
-A lot.

16:02.374 --> 16:06.037

-Something strange's going on inside me.
-Could you be pregnant?

16:15.220 --> 16:19.919
With this month's aspect,

Uh-huh. Okay, uh....

16:24.264 --> 16:28.564
l'm gonna order a pregnancy test,
and we'll take it from there.

16:28.734 --> 16:33.695
-Are you by any chance a Gemini?
-Yeah.

16:35.007 --> 16:38.637
-When's your birthday?
-June fourth.

16:38.810 --> 16:42.109
-Year?
-You know, l don't....

16:42.282 --> 16:45.115
-1 970.
-Yeah.

16:45.284 --> 16:49.118
-Time of birth?
-You have to ask my mother.

16:49.288 --> 16:51.018
What's her number?

16:54.794 --> 16:58.355
-Timmy's tried breath-holding.
-Drinking ice water.

16:58.530 --> 17:02.399
Tickling, breathing into a bag,
scary movies.

17:02.569 --> 17:04.832
l haven't slept in two nights.

17:05.003 --> 17:07.973
We're getting married in two weeks.
Will he be all right?

17:08.141 --> 17:11.133
Probably just a case
of the pre-wedding jitters.

17:12.779 --> 17:15.748
ls there anything you can give me?

17:15.915 --> 17:18.577
Thorazine sometimes works,
Mr. Falco.

17:18.750 --> 17:22.881
We'll run blood tests and take an
abdominal x-ray to cover the basics.

17:28.729 --> 17:32.357
l just can't decide
between Hawaii or Paris.

17:32.532 --> 17:35.968
-l had my heart set on the beach.
-You burn so easily.

17:36.135 --> 17:39.593
-No, l don't. l tan.
-Well, Hawaii it is.

17:39.772 --> 17:42.571
Paris sounds so romantic.

17:42.742 --> 17:46.678
-Have you checked china patterns?
-When should l have done that?

17:46.847 --> 17:49.475
-People are starting to ask.
-Really?

17:50.551 --> 17:54.680
The Tiki Torch down the street got
a guy on one of our porta-potties.

17:54.854 --> 17:59.052
That would be Louie. Would you get
a cab to pick him up, please?

18:00.627 --> 18:02.925
Where were we?

18:06.866 --> 18:10.097
-How're we doing?
-Swift's looking for Mark.

18:12.373 --> 18:15.308
Where's Dr. Greene?
Board says he's on tonight.

18:15.475 --> 18:18.001
He went home
with a touch of the flu.

18:20.581 --> 18:22.242
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

18:22.416 --> 18:24.849
Your unsolved mystery is solved.

18:25.019 --> 18:27.612
Congratulations, you're pregnant.

18:27.788 --> 18:31.486
<i>That's according to the astrological
forecast in the Tribune.</i>

18:31.659 --> 18:35.925
-And these lab results.
-Thank you, Dr. Gemini.

18:36.096 --> 18:38.962
l had a feeling
you'd bring me good news.

18:39.133 --> 18:42.363
-Are you sure there's nothing else?
-What do you mean?

18:42.536 --> 18:45.437
Well, l....

18:45.606 --> 18:47.471
l constructed your chart.

18:47.641 --> 18:51.008
l'm certain we haven't finished
our journey together.

18:51.178 --> 18:54.670
-Saturn is aligned with Mercury.
-ls that bad?

18:54.847 --> 18:57.112
lt could be.

18:57.284 --> 18:59.650
-For who?
-Both of us.

19:02.956 --> 19:08.224
You're conflicted,
searching to find your way.

19:08.395 --> 19:11.455
Go with the voice inside you.

19:11.632 --> 19:16.001
Fight the influence of others
who seek to destroy you.

19:18.640 --> 19:22.075
l'll order that ultrasound.

19:31.385 --> 19:35.344
Welcome back, Louie.
Did you miss us?

19:36.857 --> 19:39.986
Have you been drinking, Louie?

19:40.160 --> 19:43.062
You still have your catheter in?

19:45.867 --> 19:50.667
Six pints, Louie.
lt's time to change your bag.

19:52.440 --> 19:54.203
Okay.

19:56.677 --> 19:58.612
Stay right there, Louie.

19:58.779 --> 20:02.841
-How are you holding up?
-lt's nice without the boys.

20:06.487 --> 20:09.356
Cherry bomb in the trash can.

20:09.524 --> 20:10.820
Pledges.

20:10.992 --> 20:14.655
Hey, Carter.
Are you glad you stayed?

20:15.764 --> 20:17.924
There's a call on the radio.

20:19.869 --> 20:23.463
<i>-Read you, dispatch.
-Implement disaster protocol.</i>

20:23.638 --> 20:27.540
<i>EMS plan one at Wabash
and Balboa for night club fire.</i>

20:27.709 --> 20:30.405
<i>-How many? Over.
-Fifteen to twenty.</i>

20:30.613 --> 20:32.772
<i>Most with third-degree burns.</i>

20:32.948 --> 20:36.679
-l'll set up a triage point.
-l'll put out callbacks.

20:41.322 --> 20:43.688
What is it?

20:46.761 --> 20:48.991
l'm getting beeped.

20:54.270 --> 20:58.001
-At two in the morning?
-Welcome to my life.

21:01.310 --> 21:03.972
This better not be another woman.

21:08.083 --> 21:13.316
Quit making so much noise.
l'm never gonna get back to sleep.

21:20.396 --> 21:22.557
So can l come back?

21:22.730 --> 21:25.825
There's a spare key
on the kitchen table.

21:26.001 --> 21:29.766
But you have to be back out
before Jake wakes up.

21:45.187 --> 21:47.121
Oh, damn!

22:46.415 --> 22:48.976
29 minutes, 32 seconds.

22:49.151 --> 22:51.620
-l beat you.
-What?

22:51.787 --> 22:55.382
-Where's the victims?
-You're looking at them.

22:55.559 --> 22:59.256
-l'd like to introduce Dr....
-William Swift, your new chief.

22:59.429 --> 23:01.362
Good to see you all.

23:01.531 --> 23:03.624
Which one of you is a chief resident?

23:03.800 --> 23:07.930
We haven't been able to
locate Dr. Greene yet.

23:11.106 --> 23:13.701
l find these drills ideal
for meeting my team...

23:13.877 --> 23:16.971
...and assessing how quickly
the residents can mobilize.

23:17.146 --> 23:19.775
Now l'd like to take a few moments...

23:19.950 --> 23:23.478
...and go over some of the basics
of ER management.

23:23.653 --> 23:25.678
-Thank you.
-At 2:30 a.m.?

23:25.854 --> 23:28.449
Don't worry,
l'll have you home by four.

23:29.993 --> 23:35.090
-John, could you please help me?
-ls it a procedure you've done?

23:35.265 --> 23:39.634
No, it's a drunk who smashed
his fingers in a car door.

23:39.803 --> 23:42.465
He's pawing at me.
He also smells terrible.

23:42.639 --> 23:45.370
And you have a problem with that?

23:45.542 --> 23:48.534
l can hardly wait
to get out of the ER.

23:51.281 --> 23:54.080
Mr. Denardo, this is John Carter.

23:54.250 --> 23:57.947
-We'll take care of that finger.
-l want a real doctor.

23:58.121 --> 24:03.253
Great. We'll let your finger get
infected and fall off if you prefer.

24:07.130 --> 24:11.363
Thanks. You numb the finger and l'll
drain the nail bed with a cautery.

24:11.535 --> 24:14.402
This is gonna feel a little cool.

24:19.242 --> 24:20.733
Wait, wait....

24:21.779 --> 24:24.145
Ethyl chloride is flammable!

24:24.314 --> 24:25.839
Damn!

24:26.016 --> 24:31.216
l'm really sorry.
Please, don't tell anyone, okay?

24:31.822 --> 24:37.158
A patient presents to ER
ptosis, miosis and hidrosis.

24:37.328 --> 24:39.421
Dr. Ross, what does that
bring to mind?

24:39.597 --> 24:43.431
The Osis Sisters.
l dated the short one.

24:43.601 --> 24:47.900
l believe you're describing
Horner's syndrome.

24:48.072 --> 24:51.166
Otherwise a drooping eye.

24:51.342 --> 24:54.310
What should you worry about?

24:57.048 --> 25:00.142
Pancoast tumor of
the superior sulcus of the lung.

25:00.317 --> 25:03.774
-Correct. And you are....?
-Bob.

25:03.954 --> 25:08.254
l started in Housekeeping,
and now l'm a desk clerk.

25:08.427 --> 25:10.553
Dr. Greene for you on two.

25:10.728 --> 25:16.463
Many of you use antibiotics
prophylactically in animal wounds....

25:16.634 --> 25:19.000
-Where are you?
-An arcade.

25:19.171 --> 25:21.968
Didn't feel like going home.
What's up?

25:22.139 --> 25:26.508
<i>-The new chief called a drill.
-Okay.</i>

25:32.783 --> 25:37.448
One hour, 47 minutes, new record.
They're in Trauma 1 .

25:38.990 --> 25:42.118
Any questions,
my door is always open.

25:44.929 --> 25:47.489
Dr. Bagel. Come right in.

25:47.665 --> 25:52.467
-Trouble. Wild Willie is on a tear.
-Wild Willie?

25:52.637 --> 25:56.471
-Hi. Mark Greene.
-William Swift, your new chief.

25:56.641 --> 25:58.835
-How's the flu?
-The what?

25:59.010 --> 26:04.276
l guess you're feeling better, huh?
Read that before your next shift.

26:04.449 --> 26:06.145
Then we'll talk.

26:07.953 --> 26:09.214
The flu?

26:09.387 --> 26:11.878
-Sorry.
-Guess l should've stayed.

26:26.304 --> 26:28.464
Ma? Ma?

26:29.407 --> 26:30.965
l'm here.

26:31.143 --> 26:33.543
-Are you in any pain?
-No.

26:33.712 --> 26:37.773
Okay. l got you, okay? l got you.

26:37.949 --> 26:41.215
-How did it go?
-l think l blew it with the new chief.

26:41.386 --> 26:44.787
You didn't make
a strong first impression.

26:44.957 --> 26:48.483
-He sent me home.
-Get out before he changes his mind.

26:48.660 --> 26:52.654
Move the transducer down
to visualize the adnexa.

26:53.965 --> 26:59.427
-ls that the ovary?
-lt sure is, and that's the ectopic.

26:59.604 --> 27:03.700
You have both an intrauterine
and an ectopic pregnancy.

27:03.876 --> 27:06.935
Twins? That makes sense.

27:07.112 --> 27:10.605
-He's a Gemini.
-Will they be all right?

27:10.783 --> 27:13.650
You can carry the one in your uterus.

27:13.819 --> 27:17.414
But we need to remove
the other before it ruptures.

27:17.589 --> 27:21.082
-lf that happens you could die.
-l'm sorry, Arlene.

27:21.260 --> 27:26.856
Don't be. l'm having a baby
and l'm gonna be just fine.

27:28.801 --> 27:33.931
-l scraped it climbing a cliff.
-Why were you doing that?

27:34.106 --> 27:37.473
-Chasing cats.
-Cats?

27:37.642 --> 27:42.239
-l'm a werewolf.
-Oh, full moon, right?

27:42.415 --> 27:46.475
Please put me in restraints
until sunrise.

27:46.653 --> 27:48.677
lt's only a couple of hours.

27:50.590 --> 27:54.286
You think you might harm yourself
or somebody else?

27:54.461 --> 27:58.692
There's no telling
what l might do next.

27:58.866 --> 28:00.992
l'll go and get you a doctor.

28:04.370 --> 28:08.362
Never turn your back
on a werewolf!

28:09.610 --> 28:11.839
l forgot. Sorry.

28:19.652 --> 28:22.086
Oh, Carter, l'm so sorry.

28:23.357 --> 28:26.792
-Any good patients?
-No, just a couple of drunks.

28:26.959 --> 28:30.224
-Take a nap. l'll beep you if....
-l'll be in Four.

28:31.330 --> 28:33.628
-What was that?
-Werewolf.

28:33.800 --> 28:37.361
-Huh?
-Maybe you should lock your door.

28:48.648 --> 28:52.278
-You cured his hiccups.
-l feel much better.

28:52.452 --> 28:56.081
l should probably go over
the test results with you alone.

28:56.256 --> 28:59.419
No, go ahead.
We don't have any secrets.

28:59.593 --> 29:03.723
You have some potentially serious
findings in your CTs and ultrasound.

29:03.897 --> 29:06.331
How serious?

29:06.500 --> 29:10.766
These are abscesses, pockets
of bacteria invading your liver.

29:10.938 --> 29:14.600
lt's inflaming your diaphragm
which caused your hiccups.

29:15.909 --> 29:19.606
We'll have to admit you
and treat you with lV antibiotics.

29:19.780 --> 29:21.941
l see.

29:22.115 --> 29:25.846
-That will cure him, right?
-l hope so.

29:26.018 --> 29:28.681
l need to ask you
some difficult questions.

29:28.855 --> 29:30.948
Okay.

29:31.124 --> 29:35.425
ln cases when an apparently healthy
young individual like yourself...

29:35.595 --> 29:39.964
...has such an unusual illness
we need to consider the causes.

29:41.301 --> 29:44.668
-Have you ever used lV drugs?
-Never.

29:44.839 --> 29:50.243
Have you had unprotected sex
with men, prostitutes?

29:51.879 --> 29:54.676
Are you suggesting l have AlDS?

29:54.848 --> 29:59.785
lt's an unusual condition
and it's sometimes seen in HlV.

29:59.953 --> 30:02.320
lt's probably just
a bacterial infection...

30:02.489 --> 30:05.549
...but l needed to consider
the risk factors.

30:07.462 --> 30:09.987
l can't believe you're telling me this.

30:10.164 --> 30:15.032
You didn't answer my other question
about other sexual contacts.

30:15.202 --> 30:18.229
No, never.

30:24.811 --> 30:28.441
-What do you think of Wild Willie?
-l don't know.

30:28.616 --> 30:32.712
Probably gonna make us do
pushups before every shift.

30:32.887 --> 30:36.584
Think he'll make you attending
like Morgenstern said?

30:36.758 --> 30:38.588
Yeah.

30:38.759 --> 30:42.560
l hear he's promoting Carter
to chief of surgery.

30:42.730 --> 30:44.493
Uh-huh.

30:46.067 --> 30:48.968
Are you getting any sleep at all?

30:49.136 --> 30:50.399
-Mark?
-What?

30:50.571 --> 30:54.633
-You didn't hear anything l said.
-Sorry.

30:54.809 --> 30:59.974
You have to let this OB case go.
Could've happened to any one of us.

31:00.149 --> 31:05.177
-lt's upsetting to kill a patient.
-You did all you could to save her.

31:05.353 --> 31:07.879
Tell that to her husband.

31:08.056 --> 31:13.084
When that little boy takes his
first steps, his mother won't be there.

31:14.562 --> 31:19.397
-His mother will never be there.
-lt's not your fault, Mark.

31:20.802 --> 31:22.793
lt's my stop.

31:27.810 --> 31:31.541
-Come to my place. We can talk.
-What for?

31:33.415 --> 31:35.679
See you tomorrow, Doug.

32:05.747 --> 32:07.476
Let's move him.

32:09.751 --> 32:11.810
On my count....

32:11.987 --> 32:14.353
Ready? One, two, three.

32:14.523 --> 32:17.924
-What happened?
-Drunk. A 1 2-gauge to the chest.

32:18.093 --> 32:22.189
Accidentally broke into
the neighbor's house. Laryngoscope.

32:22.364 --> 32:26.027
-Seven and a half ET-tube?
-Perfect. Call Carter and Deb.

32:26.201 --> 32:29.601
-Deb's doing lacs, Carter's asleep.
-Get Carter.

32:29.771 --> 32:33.572
Call Respiratory for a vent
and Radiology for a chest film.

32:33.742 --> 32:37.838
Hang some O-neg. Cross and type
as many as you can.

32:38.014 --> 32:41.176
Looks like a flail chest.
At least four broken ribs.

32:41.351 --> 32:43.716
He's lucky to have a chest.

32:43.886 --> 32:46.514
-He's bradycardic.
-Pressure 40 palp.

32:46.689 --> 32:51.058
l'll start a central line.
Tank him up with O-neg.

32:52.394 --> 32:54.863
-Hey.
-Good morning, Carter.

32:58.100 --> 33:00.694
He's in arrest.
Give him an amp of epi.

33:00.870 --> 33:03.360
Can you do external compressions?

33:03.539 --> 33:06.099
-Carol, get him started.
-A little lower.

33:06.275 --> 33:09.142
His right chest is about to fall off.

33:09.312 --> 33:12.474
Baby with hypothermia.
Cops found it in a trash bag.

33:14.450 --> 33:18.477
Okay, line's in.
Keep the compressions going.

33:18.654 --> 33:21.647
Give him four units, and get
another body down here now.

33:21.824 --> 33:25.453
l'll call Tag.
lt's darkest before dawn.

33:25.627 --> 33:27.562
More epi?

33:28.363 --> 33:32.061
Three to four-week-old male,
BP 60 palp, rate 80.

33:32.235 --> 33:37.195
-No arrhythmias, temp 89 degrees.
-Give him heated, humidified O-2.

33:37.373 --> 33:42.437
Get a dextrose stick. Start an lV,
heated saline to 1 1 0 degrees.

33:44.113 --> 33:46.911
What kind of parent
would do this to a baby?

33:47.083 --> 33:49.847
-How's he doing?
-We're rewarming him.

33:50.019 --> 33:53.113
-Pleural lavage?
-No, we need a neonatal warmer.

33:53.289 --> 33:57.692
Check his lytes for acidosis.
l've got a thoracotomy next door.

33:58.494 --> 34:02.157
-How're we doing?
-No pulse. Bullet hit an artery.

34:02.332 --> 34:06.429
-We're losing him.
-Thoracotomy tray!

34:06.603 --> 34:10.404
-Heard you needed some help.
-We're doing a thoracotomy.

34:10.572 --> 34:12.598
Cut between the ribs.
l'll clamp the aorta.

34:12.775 --> 34:17.678
-l'm a little rusty on thoracotomies.
-We'll walk you through it.

34:17.847 --> 34:22.045
-Cut through the intercostals.
-Okay, let me get in there.

34:22.217 --> 34:24.378
Vascular clamp.

34:26.089 --> 34:27.750
Rib spreaders.

34:34.530 --> 34:37.125
Where is that little gusher?

34:37.300 --> 34:38.927
Got it. lt's clamped.

34:39.101 --> 34:41.730
-Heart's beating.
-That's teamwork.

34:41.904 --> 34:44.135
lt's fibrillating.

34:44.306 --> 34:46.706
Carter, ever felt a live heart?

34:46.877 --> 34:49.277
Make like a crocodile.

34:49.445 --> 34:54.405
Now gently compress the heart
between your fingers.

34:54.585 --> 34:58.850
-About 80 times a minute.
-Feels like a bag of worms.

34:59.023 --> 35:03.153
-A couple more units of blood.
-lt's filling.

35:04.461 --> 35:06.656
No pulse. Second unit's in.

35:06.830 --> 35:10.766
We need to shock him back
into sinus. lnternal paddles!

35:10.934 --> 35:13.494
-Start with five.
-Charging.

35:13.671 --> 35:15.866
-Clear?
-Clear.

35:17.440 --> 35:20.102
-Five more.
-Charging.

35:20.277 --> 35:22.541
-Clear?
-Clear.

35:22.713 --> 35:25.476
We've got a rhythm. Let's keep it.

35:27.284 --> 35:30.015
-l've got a pulse.
-He's stable. Good work.

35:30.187 --> 35:32.552
Take him up to the O.R.

35:44.368 --> 35:48.270
-How's he doing?
-Temperature is 92.

35:49.873 --> 35:52.364
l think he's gonna make it.

35:53.344 --> 35:57.111
-How's your guy?
-Still ticking.

35:58.649 --> 36:00.276
Hey.

36:00.451 --> 36:04.115
You look exhausted.
Why don't you take a breather?

36:05.256 --> 36:09.089
l'll call Family Services.
He'll need a foster placement.

36:34.252 --> 36:37.653
-Hey, Deb, how's it going?
-Fine, thanks.

36:37.822 --> 36:39.517
Wow....

36:39.691 --> 36:44.560
-You shaved the scalp by yourself?
-What've you been up to?

36:44.729 --> 36:48.927
Oh, internal cardiac massage.
See you later.

37:06.818 --> 37:09.116
-l don't think l like this.
-What?

37:09.287 --> 37:12.620
-You coming and going.
-Did you miss me?

37:12.791 --> 37:15.624
You woke me up.

37:17.663 --> 37:21.531
You've got fifteen minutes.
Jake's an early riser.

37:21.699 --> 37:25.568
-That's not really my style, but....
-You can do it.

37:28.240 --> 37:30.036
Come here.

37:46.659 --> 37:48.388
Mark?

37:49.594 --> 37:51.255
Hey.

37:54.065 --> 37:57.523
Lovely place to sit around
feeling sorry for yourself.

37:57.702 --> 38:00.934
lt has its charms.

38:01.105 --> 38:03.939
lt's freezing out here.

38:05.109 --> 38:07.236
-How did you find me?
-Doug.

38:08.414 --> 38:10.974
He said he'd never
seen you so upset.

38:13.619 --> 38:17.453
Things just aren't working out
the way l planned.

38:18.791 --> 38:20.521
Sure they have.

38:22.695 --> 38:24.926
You're leaving me.

38:25.097 --> 38:26.962
l didn't plan for that.

38:28.868 --> 38:33.271
People die, Mark. You do
the best you can. You're human.

38:33.438 --> 38:35.805
l'm not supposed to be.

38:37.009 --> 38:40.535
Sure you are. You're the only one
who doesn't know it.

38:48.721 --> 38:50.189
What am l gonna do?

38:52.358 --> 38:54.020
You could get breakfast.

38:55.529 --> 38:58.520
l'll even buy. Come on.

39:02.368 --> 39:04.063
Come on, Mark.

39:23.490 --> 39:26.926
Susan. Susan.

39:27.093 --> 39:30.426
Susan.
Mr. Falco's fiancée is out here.

39:30.597 --> 39:34.726
-She needs to see you.
-Yeah, sure. Bring her in.

39:39.939 --> 39:45.435
-Dr. Lewis, sorry to bother you.
-No, no problem.

39:47.780 --> 39:51.046
ls there a chance
that l might be sick?

39:53.587 --> 39:57.853
l don't know. To be safe
you should be tested for HlV.

40:00.460 --> 40:04.055
We're getting married in two weeks.
l thought l knew him.

40:04.229 --> 40:07.996
-l didn't say he had AlDS.
-l know.

40:10.870 --> 40:13.271
But l think he hasn't been
honest with me.

40:14.808 --> 40:16.367
l'm sorry.

40:18.546 --> 40:21.480
How did hiccups turn out like this?

40:37.865 --> 40:42.062
-Can l help you?
-Yeah, l'm Dr. Peter Benton.

40:42.236 --> 40:46.865
-Your wife takes care of my mother.
-Oh, yeah, sure. Al Boulet.

40:47.041 --> 40:50.168
-ls everything all right?
-Yeah.

40:51.078 --> 40:54.012
Jeanie! Peter Benton's here.

40:58.486 --> 41:00.647
What's wrong?

41:00.821 --> 41:05.190
l left the restraints off
and she fell out of bed.

41:05.358 --> 41:09.989
-ls she okay?
-She's got a couple of bruises.

41:10.164 --> 41:11.995
Her hip's okay.

41:14.268 --> 41:16.293
-l've gotta get to work.
-All right.

41:17.904 --> 41:19.806
Nice meeting you.

41:22.076 --> 41:24.237
l....

41:25.413 --> 41:28.279
l can't do this by myself.

41:28.449 --> 41:30.713
l mean...

41:30.885 --> 41:34.048
...take care of my mother.

41:34.221 --> 41:36.883
l've seen a lot of children try.

41:39.593 --> 41:44.257
You know, l'm afraid of
what's gonna happen to her.

41:46.667 --> 41:48.931
Yeah, um....

41:51.173 --> 41:52.833
Can you....?

41:58.345 --> 42:01.508
Can you help me to, you know....

42:03.618 --> 42:08.611
-Find a couple of good places?
-Sure.

42:15.130 --> 42:19.430
-l didn't think we'd make it.
-You did a great thoracotomy.

42:19.600 --> 42:21.899
You weren't so bad yourself.

42:22.070 --> 42:25.163
Hey, every full moon
should be ladies' night.

42:25.340 --> 42:29.366
-Yeah, we were terrific.
-Like Thelma and Louise, man.

42:30.111 --> 42:32.444
More like Lucy and Ethel.

42:35.116 --> 42:40.180
-Whose are those?
-Tag brought them for the wedding.

42:41.323 --> 42:46.589
-Bridesmaids still wear peach?
-You may have to wear that.

42:46.762 --> 42:49.993
-Me? A bridesmaid?
-Yeah. Would you?

42:50.165 --> 42:52.463
Yes, l would be honored.

42:52.635 --> 42:56.798
You may change your mind
when you see the dress.

43:04.747 --> 43:06.408
Hello?

43:09.317 --> 43:10.682
Hello?

43:10.853 --> 43:15.256
The sink's clogged, and somebody
stripped the damn threads.

43:15.423 --> 43:17.414
You need some help?

43:17.592 --> 43:21.551
l called Maintenance four hours ago.
lt's quicker if l do it myself.

43:21.730 --> 43:26.258
Do you need a plumber's snake?
To thread in and break up the clog.

43:27.637 --> 43:31.402
-You know, you're right.
-Don't mention it.

43:33.109 --> 43:37.011
-Are you applying for chief resident?
-l'm only second-year.

43:37.180 --> 43:39.705
Really? That's all?

43:45.154 --> 43:47.383
-Hm.
-What?

43:47.557 --> 43:49.751
l find that hard to believe.

43:49.925 --> 43:53.589
We're gonna have to make
some changes around here.

43:53.762 --> 43:56.959
There are a few kinks
in the chain of command.

43:58.267 --> 44:01.895
-Don't worry. You did a good job.
-Thank you.

44:02.071 --> 44:06.302
-Now l need a plumber's snake.
-Ask Bob.

44:06.475 --> 44:08.636
-Bob.
-Yes?

44:13.015 --> 44:15.005
-Hi, Dr. Lewis.
-Good morning, Jerry.

44:15.184 --> 44:17.948
-Busy night?
-Kind of crazy.

44:18.120 --> 44:20.281
Not for me. l had a blast.

44:20.455 --> 44:25.359
-We'll have to do a Friday the 13th.
-Oh, those are really spooky.

44:25.995 --> 44:30.524
<i>From 1962, let's twist
and shout for Susan.</i>

44:30.700 --> 44:32.429
Carter, did you do that?
