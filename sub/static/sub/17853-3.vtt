<i>Tonight on
The Curse of Oak Island...</i>

00:03.304 --> 00:06.538
<i>This, the actual start
of this Money Pit dig.</i>

00:06.640 --> 00:08.018
The story of Oak Island
revolves around this spot.

00:08.042 --> 00:10.175
<i>You're a part of history now.</i>

00:10.277 --> 00:12.089
So, these are the interesting
targets in the swamp.

00:12.113 --> 00:13.512
Let's get out there

00:13.614 --> 00:14.913
<i>and get some answers!</i>

00:15.015 --> 00:16.448
<i>The easiest thing is</i>

00:16.550 --> 00:18.350
<i>to put a diver back in there.</i>

00:18.452 --> 00:20.552
- I've got something!
- What is that?

00:20.654 --> 00:21.887
Wow, it's huge.

00:21.989 --> 00:23.589
What is this?

00:23.691 --> 00:26.558
- What does that look like?
- Looks like an "X" with a hook.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.694
<i>Is that symbol the Templars?</i>

00:31.399 --> 00:35.033
<i>There is an island
in the North Atlantic</i>

00:35.136 --> 00:38.370
<i>where people have been looking
for an incredible treasure</i>

00:38.472 --> 00:41.240
<i>for more than 200 years.</i>

00:41.342 --> 00:44.777
<i>So far, they have found
bits of gold chain,</i>

00:44.879 --> 00:48.981
<i>a stone slab with strange
symbols carved into it...</i>

00:49.083 --> 00:52.151
<i>even a 17th century
Spanish coin.</i>

00:52.253 --> 00:55.154
<i>To date, six men have died</i>

00:55.256 --> 00:57.055
<i>trying to solve the mystery.</i>

00:58.192 --> 00:59.825
<i>And, according to legend,</i>

00:59.927 --> 01:02.895
<i>one more will have to die</i>

01:02.997 --> 01:06.632
<i>before the treasure
can be found.</i>

<i>It is a day of profound change</i>

01:23.751 --> 01:26.118
<i>and sadness on Oak Island.</i>

01:26.220 --> 01:28.253
- Hey, guys. -Hey!
- Hey, guys.

01:28.355 --> 01:30.622
- So? -Well?
- How'd it go?

01:32.293 --> 01:33.692
So how'd it go, guys?

01:33.794 --> 01:35.627
It was a...
it was a very nice service.

01:35.729 --> 01:38.430
About 100 people there.

01:38.532 --> 01:40.532
<i>Rick Lagina...</i>

01:40.634 --> 01:42.134
<i>Along with Dave Blankenship</i>

01:42.236 --> 01:44.303
<i>and island historian
Charles Barkhouse...</i>

01:44.405 --> 01:46.271
<i>Have just returned</i>

01:46.373 --> 01:49.608
<i>from the funeral of Fred Nolan,
a man who,</i>

01:49.710 --> 01:52.010
<i>like Dave's father,
Dan Blankenship,</i>

01:52.112 --> 01:55.180
<i>was considered to be one of
the most important figures</i>

01:55.282 --> 02:00.152
<i>in the 221-year effort to solve
the Oak Island mystery.</i>

02:02.289 --> 02:04.790
There's a nice thing
on the back here.

02:04.892 --> 02:06.825
It's some kind of tribute
to surveyors.

02:06.927 --> 02:08.393
So, I'll read it
in honor of Fred.

02:08.496 --> 02:09.661
- How's that?
- Fine.

02:09.763 --> 02:10.963
"The Surveyor.

02:11.065 --> 02:13.799
"He thrives on patterns,

02:13.901 --> 02:16.301
"his marks and monuments
transform a wilderness,

02:16.403 --> 02:19.171
"and by his carefully tagged
and numbered squares

02:19.273 --> 02:21.507
"he clothes in certainty,

02:21.609 --> 02:23.242
"in geometrical designs,

02:23.344 --> 02:25.210
"man's ancient rights.

02:25.312 --> 02:29.047
<i>"He scans the skies,
reading some far-off star</i>

02:29.149 --> 02:30.849
<i>"by which he plots meridians</i>

02:30.951 --> 02:33.819
<i>"and makes his maps,
stitching a newfound world</i>

02:33.921 --> 02:35.988
<i>"into a patchwork quilt,</i>

02:36.090 --> 02:37.689
"a net of metes and bounds,

02:37.791 --> 02:40.692
so lands may know their own
and live in peace."

02:40.794 --> 02:43.896
<i>As one of the most prolific</i>

02:43.998 --> 02:46.164
<i>land surveyors in Nova Scotia,</i>

02:46.267 --> 02:50.502
<i>Fred Nolan first came
to Oak Island in 1958</i>

02:50.604 --> 02:54.706
<i>and was later invited
to survey the island in 1961</i>

02:54.808 --> 02:57.376
<i>by landowner M.R. Chappell.</i>

02:57.478 --> 03:00.846
<i>After locating
what he believed to be</i>

03:00.948 --> 03:03.448
<i>a number of ancient
stone markers and monuments,</i>

03:03.551 --> 03:05.751
<i>Fred became convinced</i>

03:05.853 --> 03:08.453
<i>that the key to solving
the Oak Island mystery</i>

03:08.556 --> 03:10.522
<i>was to search above ground</i>

03:10.624 --> 03:12.524
<i>rather than below it.</i>

03:12.626 --> 03:18.297
<i>But perhaps his most incredible
discovery came in 1981,</i>

03:18.399 --> 03:20.399
<i>when he identified</i>

03:20.501 --> 03:22.935
<i>five cone-shaped boulders
on his property</i>

03:23.037 --> 03:26.738
<i>that form a perfectly
symmetrical pattern,</i>

03:26.840 --> 03:30.943
<i>later known as Nolan's Cross.</i>

03:31.045 --> 03:34.046
<i>Fred, first of all,
I just want to say</i>

03:34.148 --> 03:36.281
thanks for coming
to the war room.

03:36.383 --> 03:39.618
<i>Last year, after
a long period of bitter rivalry</i>

03:39.720 --> 03:43.422
<i>between Fred Nolan and fellow
Oak Island landowner</i>

03:43.524 --> 03:45.257
<i>and treasure hunter
Dan Blankenship,</i>

03:45.359 --> 03:49.728
<i>Rick, Marty and Craig
successfully persuaded Fred</i>

03:49.830 --> 03:52.564
<i>to join forces
with the Oak Island team</i>

03:52.666 --> 03:56.101
<i>and begin sharing
valuable information.</i>

03:56.203 --> 04:00.238
How many years' work
does this map represent?

04:00.341 --> 04:02.474
- 40, 50 years.
- Wow.

04:02.576 --> 04:06.011
He brought something
to the island, the search,

04:06.113 --> 04:09.448
that no one else
in the 221 years

04:09.550 --> 04:11.583
<i>prior to him brought.</i>

04:11.685 --> 04:12.818
<i>And that is a hard science,</i>

04:12.920 --> 04:15.921
<i>a discipline,</i>

04:16.023 --> 04:19.324
<i>and to work with him
was incredible.</i>

04:19.426 --> 04:22.194
<i>Rick certainly knew him
better than I did.</i>

04:22.296 --> 04:23.462
<i>So Fred's passing</i>

04:23.564 --> 04:25.430
was quite upsetting
to Rick because,

04:25.532 --> 04:28.266
to Rick, he was a legend.

04:28.369 --> 04:30.135
<i>And you know what?
God bless my brother,</i>

04:30.237 --> 04:34.539
<i>because Rick is a guy who
believes completely in heroes.</i>

04:34.642 --> 04:36.942
"So lands may know their own
and live in peace."

04:37.044 --> 04:41.279
<i>And now it denotes
an inflection point.</i>

04:41.382 --> 04:43.015
<i>There's everything
before Fred Nolan,</i>

04:43.117 --> 04:44.877
and now there's going
to be everything after,

04:44.918 --> 04:46.618
and it'll be different.

04:46.720 --> 04:50.489
So, you know, I know it's
a somber thing for you,

04:50.591 --> 04:55.160
Rick, um, and you know,
you admire determination.

04:55.262 --> 04:58.363
- I mean, the guy was fierce.
- Yep. -No question.

04:58.465 --> 05:03.168
Well, it has been a sad couple
of days for me, but look,

05:03.270 --> 05:05.203
I'll speak for myself, and I...

05:05.305 --> 05:08.507
you know, maybe if everybody
wants to confirm it.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.375
I'm more dedicated than ever.

05:10.477 --> 05:11.910
The quest goes on.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.645
Yeah.

05:13.747 --> 05:16.648
As you correctly say,
we have the objective,

05:16.750 --> 05:19.718
and the quest, to continue.
So...

05:19.820 --> 05:22.487
do we have any understanding
of how this might affect us?

05:22.589 --> 05:25.390
In the immediate,
as we look out,

05:25.492 --> 05:27.659
I'm a bit troubled,

05:27.761 --> 05:29.661
because I had outlined

05:29.763 --> 05:32.397
what I thought was
a fairly serious agenda,

05:32.499 --> 05:34.399
working in the swamp with Fred.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.601
<i>There's no question
that Fred's passing</i>

05:36.704 --> 05:38.904
<i>could easily have
a negative impact</i>

05:39.006 --> 05:41.406
<i>on moving forward in the swamp.</i>

05:41.508 --> 05:43.408
You can't put a puzzle together

05:43.510 --> 05:45.610
if part of the pieces
are missing.

05:45.713 --> 05:47.245
I'll go out on a limb here
and say,

05:47.347 --> 05:50.849
I think, with a high confidence,
but not exact,

05:50.951 --> 05:52.851
that we can still do anything
in the swamp.

05:52.953 --> 05:55.787
My understanding is
the treasure trove license,

05:55.889 --> 05:57.723
it would pass with his estate,

05:57.825 --> 06:00.358
which would mean our deal
with him would also be valid.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.527
I think we have
the rights to continue.

06:02.629 --> 06:03.629
Yep.

06:03.731 --> 06:06.631
Yep. So, um, with that said,

06:06.734 --> 06:09.468
let's switch topics here
for a second.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.737
So, we have the Money Pit
looming large.

06:11.839 --> 06:13.405
We do have contractors,

06:13.507 --> 06:15.440
and they are coming out,
I believe.

06:15.542 --> 06:18.376
- Yep.
- These are the companies

06:18.479 --> 06:20.579
that would have the ability
to push a caisson

06:20.681 --> 06:22.447
down deep enough
so we can get a human being

06:22.549 --> 06:23.715
down in the Money Pit area.

06:23.817 --> 06:26.251
- Good.
- Which is pretty cool.

06:27.855 --> 06:29.721
So, that's what's gonna happen,

06:29.823 --> 06:30.989
and beyond that, Rick, um...

06:31.091 --> 06:32.491
Well, look,
here's the thing for me:

06:32.526 --> 06:33.658
It's been a long day.

06:33.761 --> 06:35.560
It's a sobering reminder

06:35.662 --> 06:37.295
that time waits for no one.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.164
And we're all getting older.

06:39.266 --> 06:41.466
So, let's get out there

06:41.568 --> 06:42.834
and get some answers.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.402
- Hear, hear!
- Hear, hear.

06:54.948 --> 06:59.084
<i>On the morning after
Fred Nolan's funeral, Rick,</i>

06:59.186 --> 07:02.154
<i>Marty and their partners
have turned their attention</i>

07:02.256 --> 07:04.456
<i>once again to this year's</i>

07:04.558 --> 07:07.626
<i>most ambitious...
And costly... operation:</i>

07:07.728 --> 07:12.297
<i>The excavation of two target
sites at the Money Pit.</i>

07:12.399 --> 07:15.934
<i>To accomplish this,
they have brought in</i>

07:16.036 --> 07:19.371
<i>a team from Brycon Construction
who will first create</i>

07:19.473 --> 07:22.874
<i>a new access road
leading to the site.</i>

07:22.976 --> 07:26.278
<i>Then, they will move
tons of earth</i>

07:26.380 --> 07:30.382
<i>in order to create
a completely flat surface.</i>

07:30.484 --> 07:33.785
This will allow the team
to bring in the massive

07:33.887 --> 07:36.188
cranes and steel caissons

07:36.290 --> 07:40.325
that will be driven more than
140 feet deep into the ground.

07:44.298 --> 07:45.997
I don't even want to look.

07:46.099 --> 07:48.900
- We're here?
- Yeah.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.869
<i>As the work continues,</i>

07:50.971 --> 07:54.506
<i>Rick Lagina and island
historian, Charles Barkhouse,</i>

07:54.608 --> 07:57.509
<i>arrive at the Money Pit
to see how much progress</i>

07:57.611 --> 07:58.977
<i>has been made so far.</i>

07:59.079 --> 08:00.212
Wow!

08:02.416 --> 08:05.016
I was shocked to
see what they had done.

08:05.118 --> 08:07.719
We're that much closer
to the objective, i.e.

08:07.821 --> 08:10.055
getting to the bottom of the
Money Pit.

08:10.157 --> 08:12.424
They're all about
getting the job done,

08:12.526 --> 08:16.728
as efficiently as possible,
as aggressively as possible.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.564
I mean, if this is a sample
of what's to come.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.766
I mean, of course
you're optimistic.

08:21.869 --> 08:23.335
It's amazing.

08:23.437 --> 08:25.570
It would have taken us
two months.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.772
Look, Rick, look at the
pile of timber here.

08:27.875 --> 08:30.575
Lots of timber here.

08:30.677 --> 08:33.578
Well, what do you make of it?

08:33.679 --> 08:35.347
That's some pretty big timbers,

08:37.217 --> 08:38.582
I mean, it's all through here.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.429
I mean, just wherever you walk
you can see it.

08:40.453 --> 08:42.813
I'm looking around three-sixty,
and I can see it everywhere.

08:44.124 --> 08:47.559
As the earthwork project
proceeded, I mean, we knew,

08:47.661 --> 08:49.728
the layout of the quote-unquote,

08:49.830 --> 08:52.197
Dunfield Spoil piles,
when he dug this large

08:52.299 --> 08:54.633
excavation down
into the Money Pit.

08:54.735 --> 08:58.470
We knew there might be some
artifacts, if you will,

08:58.572 --> 09:01.039
but to find them,
a large amount of wood,

09:01.141 --> 09:03.308
I mean, of course it's exciting.

09:05.045 --> 09:08.613
<i>In 1965, Oak Island
treasure hunter,</i>

09:08.715 --> 09:11.950
<i>Robert Dunfield began
an ambitious and</i>

09:12.052 --> 09:15.120
<i>extensive excavation
of the Money Pit area...</i>

09:15.222 --> 09:18.323
<i>In a desperate attempt
to reach the mysterious</i>

09:18.425 --> 09:21.126
<i>wooden treasure vault that was
reportedly discovered</i>

09:21.228 --> 09:24.763
<i>by William Chappell in 1897.</i>

09:24.865 --> 09:27.232
<i>Over a period of four months,</i>

09:27.334 --> 09:29.734
<i>Dunfield and members
of his team,</i>

09:29.836 --> 09:35.073
<i>which included Dan Blankenship,
dug a massive 100-foot wide,</i>

09:35.175 --> 09:37.943
<i>140-foot deep hole.</i>

09:38.045 --> 09:41.746
<i>In the process, they pulled
up and discarded more than</i>

09:41.848 --> 09:45.450
<i>a century of searcher tunnels
and other debris that had been</i>

09:45.552 --> 09:47.585
<i>buried in the area.</i>

09:47.688 --> 09:51.456
<i>Unfortunately, heavy winter
rains and massive flooding,</i>

09:51.558 --> 09:54.292
<i>possibly from underground
booby traps,</i>

09:54.394 --> 09:58.196
<i>caused the giant hole
to collapse before Dunfield</i>

09:58.298 --> 10:01.299
<i>could ever reach his target.</i>

10:01.401 --> 10:03.201
I mean, look, there's
another piece over here.

10:03.236 --> 10:04.836
Look. It's everywhere.

10:09.042 --> 10:11.343
Hey, look! Pottery.

10:11.445 --> 10:15.146
- Pottery?
- Yeah.

10:15.248 --> 10:17.615
- Well I don't know but...
- That is pottery.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.187
Look! Pottery!

10:22.289 --> 10:24.322
That is pottery.

10:24.424 --> 10:26.191
<i>While examining a mound of dirt</i>

You can see the glazing
in there.

10:40.407 --> 10:42.307
See that right there,
the little lines?

10:42.409 --> 10:44.375
Yeah.

10:44.478 --> 10:46.778
You know, I mean,
that might be worth testing.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.713
- Yeah.
- You know, you can see the...

10:48.782 --> 10:50.482
The... hey, look.

10:51.818 --> 10:55.120
What? You got another piece?
Wow!

10:55.222 --> 10:57.555
- It looks like a plate.
- Yes, look you can see the...

10:57.657 --> 10:59.102
That's the... The rim.
. Wait a minute.

10:59.126 --> 11:01.126
- What is that?
- Here, hold that.

11:01.228 --> 11:02.560
Is that a design?

11:02.662 --> 11:04.696
Yeah, you can
see it right there.

11:04.798 --> 11:07.565
Some kind of glazing.
Some blue something.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.701
Yeah. I mean, you can
see the rim on it, too.

11:09.803 --> 11:11.047
- Right there. Look.
- Yeah, that's a plate.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.737
Yeah, it's a plate, exactly.

11:14.508 --> 11:16.508
<i>Because the area
around the Money Pit</i>

11:16.610 --> 11:19.210
<i>has been the focus of
treasure hunting activity</i>

11:19.312 --> 11:22.480
<i>for more than 200 years,
it is difficult</i>

11:22.582 --> 11:25.150
<i>for Rick and Charles
to determine whether the</i>

11:25.252 --> 11:28.553
<i>bits of pottery were left there
by previous treasure hunters,</i>

11:28.655 --> 11:31.990
<i>or by visitors to the island
before the Money Pit</i>

11:32.092 --> 11:35.326
<i>was first discovered in 1795.</i>

11:35.428 --> 11:38.563
You know, somebody can look at
that and from the design.

11:38.665 --> 11:41.366
- Yeah.
- Maybe a pottery expert,

11:41.468 --> 11:45.103
someone who's familiar
with designs from long ago.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.238
Could it be original?
Could it be searchers?

11:47.307 --> 11:48.940
I have no idea.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.576
I mean, it just proves
that this whole area is spoils.

11:51.678 --> 11:53.044
Yep.

11:53.146 --> 11:55.046
What else is here?

11:55.148 --> 11:56.748
'Cause Dunfield did not
go through it.

11:58.318 --> 12:02.220
Finding the two
samples of pottery...

12:02.322 --> 12:04.756
I mean, those are small
tokens of what

12:04.858 --> 12:06.958
might be in the Money Pit.

12:07.060 --> 12:10.528
What might become of
this excavation.

12:10.630 --> 12:13.364
How many answers?
To what extent?

12:13.466 --> 12:14.866
I mean, it's rather exciting.

12:14.968 --> 12:18.403
Hey, Rick, what is this?

12:18.505 --> 12:19.905
- What have you got?
- I don't know.

12:20.006 --> 12:22.240
It looks like tile.

12:22.342 --> 12:25.610
It's kind of curious.
What is it?

12:25.712 --> 12:26.878
Strange looking.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.713
It is strange. Look at the
back...

12:28.815 --> 12:30.915
and then you look at
how flat it is on the face.

12:31.017 --> 12:32.750
You'd think this face would be

12:32.853 --> 12:34.652
dimpled like this, but it's not.

12:34.721 --> 12:36.321
You're right.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.656
I was intrigued cause Charles'
verbiage was,

12:38.758 --> 12:40.592
"Hey, I found a piece of tile."

12:40.694 --> 12:43.261
Tile? Really? In the Money Pit?

12:43.363 --> 12:45.263
Let's wash it off,
and take a look at it.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.367
We've found pottery up there.

12:49.469 --> 12:52.570
But what's a piece of
tile doing up there?

12:54.774 --> 12:57.508
What have you got, Rick?
Is it any clearer?

12:57.611 --> 13:01.312
Now, it could be nothing,
and it could be something.

13:01.414 --> 13:04.115
Really?
We got an "A-ha!" moment?

13:04.217 --> 13:06.117
- Maybe!
- Really?

13:06.219 --> 13:08.119
I'm not going to
tell you what I see.

13:08.221 --> 13:12.323
- Okay.
- You tell me what you see.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.826
Now this could be nothing, okay?

13:14.928 --> 13:16.160
Look at this.

13:16.263 --> 13:20.198
It looks like an "X" to me.

13:20.300 --> 13:23.434
Charles, what does that look
like?

13:23.536 --> 13:26.471
You can see that indent that...
You see that?

13:30.043 --> 13:32.877
What that looks like is
a... is an an "X" with a hook,

13:32.979 --> 13:35.713
- is what that looks like.
- Isn't that amazing?

13:35.815 --> 13:38.116
<i>A piece of tile featuring</i>

13:38.218 --> 13:40.852
<i>a carved "X"... with a hook?</i>

13:42.789 --> 13:44.389
<i>In recent years,</i>

13:44.491 --> 13:47.358
<i>a growing number of
researchers and scholars,</i>

13:47.460 --> 13:50.862
<i>most notably forensic geologist
Scott Wolter,</i>

13:50.964 --> 13:53.831
<i>have suggested that the symbol
of a so-called,</i>

13:53.934 --> 13:57.902
<i>"hooked x" is based on
an ancient rune symbol,</i>

13:58.004 --> 14:01.472
<i>that was adopted by the Knights
Templar and used to mark their</i>

14:01.574 --> 14:05.543
<i>path during their exploration
of North America as far back</i>

14:05.645 --> 14:07.578
<i>as the 14th century.</i>

14:10.483 --> 14:13.484
<i>Two weeks ago, during a
conference call</i>

14:13.586 --> 14:16.888
<i>with New York-based author
and researcher, Zena Halpern,</i>

14:16.990 --> 14:20.158
<i>the Oak Island team was
presented with two maps</i>

14:20.260 --> 14:23.828
<i>and what was alleged to be
a copy of an ancient document</i>

14:23.930 --> 14:26.064
<i>with markings similar
to those carved</i>

14:26.166 --> 14:30.268
<i>on the stone slab found
in the Money Pit in 1804.</i>

14:58.732 --> 15:01.032
<i>Is it possible that
what Rick and Charles</i>

15:01.134 --> 15:03.034
<i>are looking at is proof</i>

15:03.136 --> 15:05.803
<i>that Zena Halpern's
theory is correct?</i>

15:05.905 --> 15:08.940
<i>Could this really be
an important clue,</i>

15:09.042 --> 15:12.810
<i>linking the Templars to what
lies buried on Oak Island?</i>

15:12.912 --> 15:14.612
That is an "X" with a hook.

15:14.714 --> 15:16.247
That in and of itself
is interesting.

15:16.349 --> 15:18.816
What would be more interesting
is to have

15:18.918 --> 15:20.718
the geologist look at this,

15:20.820 --> 15:23.621
and see, is this a creation
of man?

15:23.723 --> 15:26.657
Is it rock, what is it?

15:26.760 --> 15:28.726
And then, perhaps,
it can be dated.

15:28.828 --> 15:31.162
- Yes.
- Maybe, it's not even indigenous

15:31.264 --> 15:33.998
- to the North Atlantic.
- Looking at the back,

15:34.100 --> 15:36.234
I'd be curious as to what type
of stone this is too?

15:36.336 --> 15:37.902
- Look at that.
- It's very strange.

15:38.004 --> 15:42.306
It is very strange.
But it's definitely stone.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.008
Very odd.

15:44.110 --> 15:46.255
It's not the complete "X,"
though, what it's saying is,

15:46.279 --> 15:47.445
you're close, keep going.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.149
And if it's an omen,
it's a good omen.

15:51.251 --> 15:53.451
- Yep.
- Let's go, Rick.

15:56.389 --> 15:59.424
<i>As the operation to
clear and prep the Money Pit</i>

15:59.526 --> 16:00.858
<i>area continues...</i>

16:01.961 --> 16:03.161
- Hey, Matt.
- How you doing?

16:03.263 --> 16:05.296
- Hey.
- Alex.

16:05.398 --> 16:06.831
Nice to meet you, Matt.

16:06.933 --> 16:07.943
- Good seeing you guys again.
- Good seeing you.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.634
Good seeing you again.

16:09.702 --> 16:11.047
<i>The Laginas and their
partners meet with.</i>

16:11.071 --> 16:13.137
<i>Metal Detection Expert
Matt Savelle</i>

16:13.239 --> 16:17.041
<i>from Canadian
Seabed Research Limited.</i>

16:17.143 --> 16:19.677
Okay, I think everybody
knows Matt Savelle;

16:19.813 --> 16:22.613
Canadian Seabed Research.
Matt came in.

16:22.715 --> 16:26.818
They re-ran some of the same
points that we did last winter,

16:26.920 --> 16:29.053
different methodologies,
different equipment,

16:29.155 --> 16:31.989
and now the data is back,
and you're going to get us

16:32.092 --> 16:33.524
back in the swamp I take it,
right?

16:33.626 --> 16:35.560
- I'll try.
- Let's see what you got.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.662
- Don't try too hard.
- Yeah, that's right.

16:37.764 --> 16:41.399
I guess we'll look at the,
the EM-61 data first.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.468
So, the EM data,
mainly we're going to be

16:43.570 --> 16:46.704
- looking at metal.
- Ferrous or non-ferrous.

16:46.806 --> 16:48.039
- Yeah.
- Okay.

16:48.141 --> 16:50.508
<i>Earlier this year,</i>

16:50.610 --> 16:55.246
<i>the Oak Island team invited
Matt to run an EM61 metal</i>

16:55.348 --> 16:56.625
<i>detection device over the
mysterious,</i>

16:56.649 --> 16:58.816
<i>triangle-shaped swamp.</i>

16:58.918 --> 17:00.251
Make sure you cover the
area where.

17:00.353 --> 17:03.354
- Tony pulled the stump from.
- Okay.

17:03.456 --> 17:05.723
<i>Equipped with highly sensitive</i>

17:05.825 --> 17:08.159
<i>transmitter and receiver coils,</i>

17:08.261 --> 17:12.063
<i>the EM61 can detect metal
objects as deep</i>

17:12.165 --> 17:14.499
<i>as thirty feet below ground.</i>

17:14.601 --> 17:17.401
Hey, Rick!
We've got a big hit over here!

17:17.503 --> 17:20.738
- Where to?
- Same spot where the stumps are.

17:23.143 --> 17:24.775
<i>After extensive processing</i>

17:24.877 --> 17:26.711
<i>of the collected data,</i>

17:26.813 --> 17:30.081
<i>Matt Savelle has produced a
comprehensive map that shows</i>

17:30.183 --> 17:34.285
<i>metal objects at the northern
tip of the swamp as well as</i>

17:34.387 --> 17:37.622
<i>near the swamp's southwestern
border.</i>

17:37.724 --> 17:39.757
So, we ran a lot of lines.

17:39.859 --> 17:42.627
That's the short story of it.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.629
But I basically narrowed it down

17:44.731 --> 17:47.598
to the lines that we
should really focus on.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.600
So this area over here
where we have the yellow

17:49.702 --> 17:53.037
targets is basically,
this is the back pond.

17:53.139 --> 17:55.206
This is the pond we couldn't
drain,

17:55.308 --> 17:57.074
- when we drained the swamp.
- Right. Yeah.

17:57.177 --> 17:58.988
- It's still wet back there.
- It retained its water.

17:59.012 --> 18:02.513
Yeah, it's pretty obvious that
there's something here, right?

18:02.615 --> 18:07.285
There's two hits over there.
That's the big hit back there.

18:07.387 --> 18:09.220
This is the smaller hit.

18:09.322 --> 18:12.290
It's safe to say that it's
less than a meter below the

18:12.392 --> 18:14.325
actual stump that
we kept hitting it...

18:14.427 --> 18:15.838
Is that where the stump is,
Rick? That you recollect?

18:15.862 --> 18:18.062
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it was a big stump.

18:18.164 --> 18:21.499
- And the hit is beneath it?
- I believe beneath it,

18:21.601 --> 18:24.735
or, I mean, it could be just on
the outside, or below it.

18:24.837 --> 18:26.404
Well, the significance, I think,

18:26.506 --> 18:28.773
is that, if it's under
the stump that makes it very,

18:28.875 --> 18:31.275
- very old.
- Yeah. Alright,

18:31.377 --> 18:33.911
we'll move on to the west swamp.

18:35.315 --> 18:40.751
This target is, I believe,
lying flat...

18:40.853 --> 18:45.356
and it has some length to it,
just based on these targets.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.102
- It's a big thing.
- Yeah, it's bigger than

18:47.126 --> 18:49.260
what I've shown you in the last
two hits, so.

18:54.133 --> 18:57.335
Can you produce all these
with GPS coordinates?

18:57.437 --> 18:59.804
Yep. This whole
thing is on a grid.

18:59.906 --> 19:01.872
Easting, Northing, Lat., Long.,

19:01.975 --> 19:04.208
but I'll give you
exact positions.

19:04.310 --> 19:05.643
- Okay. Great.
- Yeah.

19:05.745 --> 19:07.612
These are obvious targets,
right?

19:07.714 --> 19:09.614
In the sense that a handheld
will pick them up,

19:09.716 --> 19:11.515
will it not? A handheld,
underwater?

19:11.584 --> 19:12.883
- Underwater.
- Yeah.

19:12.986 --> 19:14.530
- It would help.
- Does that mean Tony Sampson

19:14.554 --> 19:17.188
goes in and use the
dive gear and mucks about?

19:17.290 --> 19:18.789
Yes, yes. That's what it means.

19:18.891 --> 19:21.892
I think it's well worth
doing, that's for sure.

19:21.995 --> 19:23.715
Just as long as I don't have
to go in there.

19:33.772 --> 19:37.741
- So, back to the swamp.
- Yeah, back to the swamp.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.542
Just where you want to be.

19:39.644 --> 19:42.045
No, look, I'm geeked about
the swamp all of a sudden.

19:42.147 --> 19:43.747
I know, it's weird.

19:43.849 --> 19:46.349
It's deja vu all over again.
It's three years running,

19:46.451 --> 19:48.718
but I'd like to put an
X through things.

19:48.820 --> 19:51.121
There's much work to do
before that happens.

19:51.223 --> 19:53.623
We found a coin in the swamp.

19:53.725 --> 19:55.625
We found an ancient coin.

19:57.329 --> 19:59.696
<i>Three years ago,
while searching in the</i>

19:59.798 --> 20:01.531
<i>swamp with a metal detector,</i>

20:01.633 --> 20:05.235
<i>Rick, Marty and their team
discovered a small metal</i>

20:05.337 --> 20:07.570
<i>coin buried in the mud.</i>

20:07.672 --> 20:10.407
<i>When the coin was later
cleaned and examined,</i>

20:10.509 --> 20:14.811
<i>it was revealed to be a 17th
century Spanish Maravedi,</i>

20:14.913 --> 20:17.981
<i>making it the oldest and
possibly the most important</i>

20:18.083 --> 20:21.418
<i>object found on
Oak Island to date.</i>

20:21.520 --> 20:24.988
<i>It also validated the
many stories and legends</i>

20:25.090 --> 20:27.791
<i>concerning the island
that claim Spanish</i>

20:27.893 --> 20:31.494
<i>explorers and even pirates
came here centuries ago</i>

20:31.596 --> 20:35.165
<i>to bury a priceless treasure.</i>

20:35.267 --> 20:38.968
So now we have a bunch of
targets where an expert

20:39.070 --> 20:41.237
says with a high degree
of certainty they're real

20:41.339 --> 20:44.240
and I think we need to fish
them out of there.

20:44.342 --> 20:46.676
Yeah. There's something there.

20:46.778 --> 20:49.145
We have several targets
we want to investigate,

20:49.247 --> 20:51.981
so the best way to
proceed is with a diver.

20:52.083 --> 20:54.617
So we call Tony Sampson,
he's done work for us before,

20:54.719 --> 20:57.086
he's a tough guy, and
an accomplished diver.

20:57.189 --> 20:58.822
El bandito is here.

20:58.924 --> 21:01.191
- Good to see you, buddy.
- Good to see you!

21:01.293 --> 21:02.933
We're gonna put him
in on the first target

21:02.961 --> 21:04.527
which is the back pond.

21:04.629 --> 21:07.096
There's something very
significant right there.

21:07.199 --> 21:08.998
You might actually be able

21:09.100 --> 21:12.001
to swim, it's actually like a
meter and a half deep there.

21:12.103 --> 21:13.703
- Fantastic.
- And then there's something

21:13.805 --> 21:15.338
about a half a meter down.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.751
So you're going to have to dig
through that muck.

21:16.775 --> 21:18.107
- The muck.
- Yeah.

21:18.210 --> 21:19.921
But what we want to try first,
Tony, you know,

21:19.945 --> 21:21.711
back in that pond that we
can never drain.

21:21.813 --> 21:23.279
- Aha.
- There's a stump there,

21:23.381 --> 21:26.883
for sure, and underneath the
stump is a target,

21:26.985 --> 21:31.120
which-which the stump was
carbon dated to pre-1600.

21:31.223 --> 21:34.157
So, whatever is under there
could be very old indeed.

21:34.259 --> 21:36.392
Fantastic.

21:36.495 --> 21:38.895
<i>Diver Tony Sampson
has been exploring</i>

21:38.997 --> 21:43.166
<i>the waters around Oak
Island for more than a decade.</i>

21:43.268 --> 21:47.036
<i>Last summer, he helped the
team identify several strange</i>

21:47.138 --> 21:50.740
<i>triangle-shaped boulders
located just 100 yards off</i>

21:50.809 --> 21:54.544
<i>the island's southwestern coast.</i>

21:54.646 --> 21:56.713
<i>It was also Tony, who,</i>

21:56.815 --> 21:59.749
<i>while exploring the Oak
Island swamp two years ago,</i>

21:59.851 --> 22:02.719
<i>found the stump of
a large oak tree.</i>

22:02.821 --> 22:03.821
What the hell is that?

22:06.625 --> 22:09.392
- It's a big tree stump.
- Well, that's weird.

22:09.494 --> 22:11.427
What's that doing out in the
middle of nowhere?

22:11.530 --> 22:14.697
<i>Because Oak trees
cannot grow in water,</i>

22:14.799 --> 22:18.768
<i>Tony's discovery provided an
important piece of evidence to</i>

22:18.870 --> 22:23.339
<i>support the theory that the
Oak Island swamp was man-made.</i>

22:23.441 --> 22:25.186
Let's get out and find the
targets, okay? Come on.

22:25.210 --> 22:27.176
Excellent. Let's do it.

22:27.279 --> 22:29.412
The obstacle for Tony
is two-fold.

22:29.514 --> 22:33.082
One is low visibility
or zero visibility,

22:33.184 --> 22:37.020
and the other issue of course
is can he move the material

22:37.122 --> 22:41.558
sufficient to actually find the
target and perhaps retrieve it.

22:44.129 --> 22:46.863
- Alright.
- Put your backs into it.

22:52.837 --> 22:54.904
First he has to locate
the stump,

22:55.006 --> 22:58.608
then he finds it with the metal
detector and he gets a hit,

22:58.710 --> 23:00.443
he pin-points it with this,

23:00.545 --> 23:02.705
- and then he tries to dig it up.
- He comes up with it.

23:05.550 --> 23:07.584
The stinky swamp.

23:07.686 --> 23:11.120
- I've never missed the smell.
- No, me either.

23:11.222 --> 23:13.122
Are you on the stump?

23:15.527 --> 23:18.127
- Yeah.
- Good.

23:18.229 --> 23:20.797
The anomaly should
be on this front side.

23:20.899 --> 23:23.399
Should be right over there
somewhere.

23:27.405 --> 23:29.305
Find it.

23:29.407 --> 23:32.141
Retrive it, don't find it.
Get it.

23:48.927 --> 23:50.360
You want the pin-pointer?

23:52.163 --> 23:54.764
- Alright.
- Well, that's encouraging.

23:57.602 --> 23:59.335
Really?

23:59.404 --> 24:01.771
Do you get a sense that
the stump is rooted?

24:01.873 --> 24:03.573
It's not placed there?

24:07.612 --> 24:11.047
The anomaly is it right
close or underneath that

24:11.149 --> 24:12.149
big main one that comes...

24:16.588 --> 24:17.754
Okay, cool.

24:17.856 --> 24:19.355
Let us know if you want
the shovel.

24:22.761 --> 24:25.528
Why are there stumps in the
swamp?

24:25.630 --> 24:27.163
Big stumps.

24:32.303 --> 24:34.504
Obviously, something
intrigues him.

24:34.606 --> 24:35.606
Yeah.

24:36.508 --> 24:38.007
Still getting hits?

24:41.446 --> 24:42.446
Good.

24:43.515 --> 24:44.914
All right.

24:55.694 --> 24:57.560
Whoa.

25:01.574 --> 25:03.408
- Yes.
- Really?

25:03.510 --> 25:06.644
<i>While looking for
metal objects buried beneath</i>

25:06.746 --> 25:10.415
<i>the Oak Island swamp,
local diver, Tony Sampson,</i>

25:10.517 --> 25:13.284
<i>has just made what he
and the team hopes is</i>

25:13.386 --> 25:14.786
<i>an important discovery.</i>

25:14.888 --> 25:16.921
If it really is under the stump,

25:17.023 --> 25:18.823
doesn't it have to be ancient?

25:18.925 --> 25:20.792
You would think.

25:20.894 --> 25:23.327
The stump is at least four,

25:23.430 --> 25:26.431
four hundred years, four hundred
and fifty years old.

25:36.042 --> 25:37.408
- You got the!
- Yes!

25:37.510 --> 25:39.744
That would be a Fred Nolan
survey marker.

25:39.846 --> 25:42.180
- Yep.
- He was marking the stump

25:42.282 --> 25:43.759
probably... See if there's
anything else,

25:43.783 --> 25:45.683
Tony, with that out of there,
please.

25:49.756 --> 25:52.657
That's for sure one of his
markers, isn't it?

25:52.759 --> 25:54.325
It should say on it.

25:57.597 --> 26:01.032
Well, that can go in the museum.

26:01.134 --> 26:03.634
Obviously, Fred had
marked the stump;

26:03.736 --> 26:05.636
How he found it would be
curious.

26:05.738 --> 26:08.606
Why he felt it was significant
to the point where he marked it,

26:08.708 --> 26:12.310
I don't know. Just a few more
questions really that arose

26:12.412 --> 26:14.111
from that discovery.

26:14.214 --> 26:17.014
<i>Oak Island landowner
and treasure hunter,</i>

26:17.116 --> 26:19.150
<i>Fred Nolan, was convinced</i>

26:19.252 --> 26:22.186
<i>that one of the
keys to solving the mystery</i>

26:22.288 --> 26:25.890
<i>was located beneath
the surface of the Swamp.</i>

26:25.992 --> 26:29.861
<i>When he first drained
the swamp in 1969,</i>

26:29.963 --> 26:32.029
<i>Fred located a
number of man-made</i>

26:32.131 --> 26:34.332
<i>metal and wooden objects.</i>

26:34.434 --> 26:37.702
<i>Including what he believed
to be a spar, or boom,</i>

26:37.804 --> 26:40.538
<i>from an ancient sailing vessel.</i>

26:40.640 --> 26:43.508
<i>This led him to the belief
that Oak Island was,</i>

26:43.610 --> 26:47.178
<i>at one time, not one island,
but two,</i>

26:47.280 --> 26:50.581
<i>and that the swamp
itself was man-made.</i>

26:50.683 --> 26:52.717
<i>According to Nolan's theory,</i>

26:52.819 --> 26:55.853
<i>a treasure ship could have
been sailed into an area</i>

26:55.955 --> 26:57.722
<i>between the two islands.</i>

26:57.824 --> 27:00.858
<i>Then, surrounded by a
giant cofferdam,</i>

27:00.960 --> 27:02.493
<i>was deliberately submerged</i>

27:02.595 --> 27:05.196
<i>beneath thousands
of gallons of water,</i>

27:05.298 --> 27:08.699
<i>thus creating a swamp that
would hide both the ship</i>

27:08.801 --> 27:11.702
<i>and its precious cargo.</i>

27:11.804 --> 27:15.573
<i>But Fred Nolan was not alone
in believing that the key</i>

27:15.675 --> 27:18.843
<i>to solving the Oak Island
mystery lies buried at</i>

27:18.945 --> 27:22.880
<i>the bottom of the strange,
triangle-shaped swamp.</i>

27:22.982 --> 27:27.018
<i>Two years ago, Oak Island
researchers Alan Butler</i>

27:27.120 --> 27:29.620
<i>and Kathleen McGowan told Rick,</i>

27:29.722 --> 27:33.224
<i>Marty and the team that they
believed a vast treasure could</i>

27:33.326 --> 27:37.261
<i>be found by digging in the
area of the swamp he called,</i>

27:37.363 --> 27:39.363
<i>"The Enochian Chamber."</i>

27:39.465 --> 27:43.534
If it's ever possible to
say that "X marks the spot,"

27:43.636 --> 27:49.607
what you're looking for is 996
feet due west of the Money Pit.

27:49.709 --> 27:53.077
The prophecies about the new
Jerusalem say that the Jerusalem

27:53.179 --> 27:56.948
will be built on
an island of swamp.

27:57.050 --> 27:59.283
<i>Other theories have suggested</i>

27:59.385 --> 28:01.419
<i>that the swamp is hiding
everything</i>

28:01.521 --> 28:04.322
<i>from the lost folios
of William Shakespeare...</i>

28:04.424 --> 28:08.426
<i>to a vault containing
sacred religious objects.</i>

28:08.528 --> 28:11.262
<i>But one fact is certain:</i>

28:11.364 --> 28:13.497
<i>Getting to what may lie
buried in the muddy,</i>

28:13.600 --> 28:15.800
<i>marshy waters of the swamp would</i>

28:15.902 --> 28:18.069
<i>require an engineering feat even</i>

28:18.171 --> 28:22.039
<i>more complicated and costly
than digging in the Money Pit.</i>

28:26.613 --> 28:28.324
It's kind of interesting
that we're out here,

28:28.348 --> 28:31.349
and pulling up Fred's stuff.
Maybe he's clueing us in.

28:31.451 --> 28:33.951
Yeah, keep looking, guys.
Don't give up.

28:42.729 --> 28:45.196
You're not getting any hits now?

28:45.298 --> 28:49.867
Nothing underneath that big
root?

28:49.969 --> 28:53.104
Well, we found our bits
of metal.

28:53.206 --> 28:56.974
So that's disappointing in a
sense except that it verifies

28:57.076 --> 29:00.845
that our data's good and it's a
significant piece of metal.

29:00.947 --> 29:05.149
So, it's a bust in the sense
that it doesn't really add

29:05.251 --> 29:07.652
anything to the search
but it verifies the data.

29:07.754 --> 29:09.620
On to the next target.

29:09.722 --> 29:11.989
Look, you solved a mini-mystery,

29:12.091 --> 29:14.158
but there's plenty more to do,
if you're up to it.

29:14.260 --> 29:16.227
- Yep, sure thing.
- There's that one big anomaly,

29:16.329 --> 29:17.194
and I think that's where we
should go next.

29:17.296 --> 29:18.562
Yeah, that's next.

29:18.665 --> 29:20.331
Well guys,
I hate to make you do this,

29:20.433 --> 29:23.034
but we're going to have to slog
our way over to the next target,

29:23.136 --> 29:24.669
but it's in the open water,

29:24.771 --> 29:26.415
it'll be easier once we
get there, so let's get going.

29:26.439 --> 29:27.439
All right.

29:29.242 --> 29:30.875
There is where the anomaly is,
Tony.

29:30.977 --> 29:32.643
- It should be quite large.
- Fantastic.

29:32.745 --> 29:34.812
Yep. You're going to find
this one, no problem.

29:34.914 --> 29:38.816
- I hope it's not a survey stake.
- Find something intriguing.

29:38.918 --> 29:40.851
- Yeah.
- Let's go get it!

29:46.259 --> 29:49.760
There's something here.
That's for sure.

29:49.862 --> 29:51.262
Bring up a coin.

29:51.364 --> 29:54.432
Anything.

29:54.534 --> 29:56.567
How deep was this target
supposed to be, Rick?

29:56.669 --> 29:58.369
About a foot.

30:03.176 --> 30:05.609
Okay, here we go.

30:05.712 --> 30:08.995
- What is that?
- Wow. It's huge.

30:23.029 --> 30:25.129
- What is that?
- Looks like a piece of wood.

30:25.231 --> 30:28.532
- A board.
- It's a large board.

30:28.634 --> 30:32.870
- Are there nails in it?
- I don't see nails.

30:32.972 --> 30:34.772
They're knots, aren't they?

30:34.874 --> 30:36.774
They're knots, yeah.

30:36.876 --> 30:38.142
Jack can you haul it to shore,

30:38.244 --> 30:40.044
and maybe you can keep
looking around?

30:40.146 --> 30:42.913
I got a hit off it so it could
be something underneath it.

30:43.015 --> 30:45.216
That's why I'm not moving.

30:45.318 --> 30:46.628
I'm sure there's something
down here.

30:46.652 --> 30:47.985
Absolutely.

30:48.087 --> 30:50.387
When Tony came up
with a big long plank,

30:50.490 --> 30:53.457
my first thought was"
crap, there's the anomaly."

30:53.559 --> 30:56.827
Because he said it was full of
bolts or nails

30:56.929 --> 30:59.096
it would explain all those hits.

30:59.198 --> 31:01.832
I'm not seeing any nails,
though.

31:01.934 --> 31:05.803
Tony Sampson, he pulled
up this really long board,

31:05.905 --> 31:09.940
and we didn't know
exactly what it was.

31:10.042 --> 31:11.976
I'm normally the person
that handles

31:12.078 --> 31:13.744
the metal detector, and so,

31:13.846 --> 31:17.615
I was hopeful there might be
some evidence for anything metal

31:17.717 --> 31:20.751
or anything like that;
Maybe nails.

31:20.853 --> 31:22.419
Nothin'.

31:29.695 --> 31:31.295
I'm not getting any hits, guys!

31:31.397 --> 31:34.632
- Okay, good!
- Okay. Well then, two things;

31:34.734 --> 31:37.568
Either we're way off on
our location, or it's deeper.

31:37.670 --> 31:38.903
It's deep.

31:43.309 --> 31:44.875
You know, I'm finally starting

31:44.977 --> 31:46.537
to think this through,
and I'm thinking,

31:46.579 --> 31:48.813
now wait a minute,
if he comes up with something,

31:48.881 --> 31:51.482
it's going to be shallow;
It's going to be insignificant.

31:51.584 --> 31:54.018
I'd prefer it to be deep.

31:54.120 --> 31:57.288
The anomalies whatever they are,
are still down there.

31:57.390 --> 31:59.123
Hey, Tony!

31:59.225 --> 32:02.393
We'll call it a day unless you
got onto something real good.

32:02.495 --> 32:03.828
Yeah, thank you.

32:03.930 --> 32:06.697
Okay, let's go look at
that board, Rick.

32:06.766 --> 32:11.335
There's only one possible
way to analyze that.

32:11.437 --> 32:14.405
Tony couldn't find the
largest anomaly in the swamp.

32:14.507 --> 32:19.810
And that is, that it's deeper
than his equipment can look.

32:19.912 --> 32:21.579
That means that,

32:21.681 --> 32:25.816
because it's such impenetrable
ground on that end of the swamp,

32:25.918 --> 32:30.855
almost certainly somebody
put it down there.

32:30.957 --> 32:32.857
By the way, you did a great job.

32:32.959 --> 32:35.526
I mean, here Rick and
I sitting in the boat,

32:35.628 --> 32:37.995
and you and Jack out there
working.

32:38.097 --> 32:40.664
Sorry, but somebody
had to do it.

32:40.766 --> 32:45.669
So... it's definitely not
our target but it's interesting.

32:45.771 --> 32:48.038
It's longish
for dimensional lumber.

32:48.140 --> 32:49.440
It's probably eighteen feet
long,

32:49.542 --> 32:51.909
which is an odd dimension.

32:52.011 --> 32:54.945
I'm thinking, plank,
either deck planking,

32:55.047 --> 32:57.448
or the side of
the ship planking.

32:57.516 --> 33:00.351
Because it was obvious,
it was very long.

33:00.453 --> 33:02.620
<i>A section of planking?</i>

33:02.722 --> 33:05.556
<i>Possibly from an
old wooden ship?</i>

33:05.625 --> 33:09.526
<i>How could something like this
find its way to the bottom of</i>

33:09.629 --> 33:11.295
<i>the Oak Island swamp?</i>

33:11.397 --> 33:14.732
<i>Could it be proof that the
incredible theory of</i>

33:14.834 --> 33:17.968
<i>a treasure ship buried here is
true?</i>

33:18.070 --> 33:20.604
If it costs nothing
to carbon date it,

33:20.706 --> 33:22.439
- let's do it.
- Yeah.

33:22.541 --> 33:25.743
What's curious to me is
the fact that the bottom of

33:25.845 --> 33:28.712
that part of the swamp,
the western side of the swamp,

33:28.814 --> 33:31.048
is almost impenetrable bottom.

33:31.150 --> 33:33.717
So, it had to have
been put there.

33:33.819 --> 33:37.821
It's incredibly exciting.
And it's a dig-able target,

33:37.924 --> 33:40.324
a legitimate dig-able target.

33:40.426 --> 33:41.926
No stone unturned.

33:42.028 --> 33:44.795
- Or board.
- Or board.

33:44.864 --> 33:47.665
- Okay, fine.
- You mean, no swamp undrained.

33:47.767 --> 33:50.501
Yeah, right, okay. Let's drain
the swamp again.

33:52.071 --> 33:53.904
I'm settling for draining
a beer.

33:54.006 --> 33:56.807
- Yeah.
- I like that a lot, Tony.

33:56.909 --> 33:59.109
Nice job. Nice job, today.

34:06.752 --> 34:10.420
<i>While Rick, Marty and
the team await lab analysis</i>

34:10.523 --> 34:13.424
<i>of their recent find at the
Oak Island swamp...</i>

34:13.525 --> 34:15.036
- Good morning.
- Hi Phil, Craig Tester.

34:15.061 --> 34:16.994
How you doing, guys?

34:17.096 --> 34:18.562
<i>Rick Lagina and Craig Tester</i>

34:18.630 --> 34:20.331
<i>have brought geologist
Phil Finck</i>

34:20.433 --> 34:22.967
<i>to the island,
to inspect another...</i>

34:23.069 --> 34:25.835
<i>And perhaps equally compelling
find.</i>

34:25.938 --> 34:29.505
If I can ask, Phil,
what is your area of expertise?

34:29.608 --> 34:31.675
I have several specialties.

34:31.777 --> 34:35.612
But the one that would be most
appropriate to you folks would

34:35.715 --> 34:38.614
be the glacial geology,
and the modern processes,

34:38.717 --> 34:41.885
things that would have happened
in the last thousands of years.

34:41.987 --> 34:43.699
Well, we've got a few rocks
we'd like you to

34:43.723 --> 34:47.524
- take a quick look here.
- Right. Sure.

34:47.626 --> 34:50.527
Stones have played a
significant role in the

34:50.596 --> 34:52.696
telling of the story
of Oak Island.

34:52.797 --> 34:55.232
And to have someone in
a professional capacity

34:55.333 --> 34:58.702
come and look at the stone,
and perhaps render an opinion.

34:58.804 --> 35:02.539
Look, no one will know
better than a geologist.

35:02.641 --> 35:04.281
Here's what we want you to take
a look at.

35:04.343 --> 35:06.643
Yep.

35:06.746 --> 35:08.712
A stone like that is
quite unusual.

35:08.814 --> 35:10.681
I've not seen anything
like that.

35:10.783 --> 35:13.484
- Have you, Craig?
- No. Not really.

35:13.586 --> 35:15.486
It was found at surface,

35:15.588 --> 35:17.888
but after the surface
had been removed,

35:17.990 --> 35:20.190
probably 6-8 feet, or so?

35:20.292 --> 35:22.726
Just laying there on
top of the soil.

35:25.231 --> 35:30.501
It's a sedimentary rock.
It's also metamorphosed.

35:30.603 --> 35:33.003
Cooked. Crest.

35:33.105 --> 35:36.940
It is some sort of a sandstone.

35:39.045 --> 35:43.480
The surface does have a
number of very fine scratches on

35:43.582 --> 35:49.219
it those are glacial striations
that form when.

35:49.321 --> 35:52.389
Silurian rock and ice has
another rock,

35:52.491 --> 35:54.591
and it drags it across
the surface of this one,

35:54.693 --> 35:57.061
and acts like tool and
they would look very

35:57.163 --> 35:58.896
fresh when they were first done,

35:58.998 --> 36:03.400
but over time they
weather and darken.

36:03.502 --> 36:06.437
These other markings
on the stone,

36:06.539 --> 36:10.541
they appear to be a man-made
feature that was scratched

36:10.643 --> 36:12.776
onto the rock.

36:12.878 --> 36:15.612
<i>A man-made feature?</i>

36:15.714 --> 36:18.082
<i>Could the carved stone that
Rick Lagina</i>

36:18.184 --> 36:19.983
<i>and the team found near
the Money Pit</i>

36:20.086 --> 36:23.654
<i>bearing a "hooked X" really
be a clue as to what</i>

36:23.756 --> 36:26.757
<i>might be buried on Oak Island?</i>

36:26.859 --> 36:30.761
<i>And will it prove a connection
between Oak Island and the</i>

36:30.863 --> 36:34.164
<i>activities of the Knights
Templar in North America?</i>

36:34.266 --> 36:37.634
<i>Perhaps the answer lies
buried deep beneath the</i>

36:37.736 --> 36:39.937
<i>surface of the Money Pit,</i>

36:40.039 --> 36:44.241
<i>or possibly with a plank of
wood recently recovered from</i>

36:44.343 --> 36:46.443
<i>the Oak Island swamp.</i>

36:54.662 --> 36:56.662
<i>As the task of clearing,</i>

36:56.764 --> 36:59.965
<i>leveling and preparing the
Money Pit for excavation</i>

37:00.068 --> 37:02.535
<i>enters its second week...</i>

37:02.637 --> 37:07.039
<i>Rick, Marty and their partners
gather in the War Room.</i>

37:07.141 --> 37:09.875
<i>They are eager to learn
the results of the tests</i>

37:09.944 --> 37:13.245
<i>that were conducted on the
large wooden plank found</i>

37:13.347 --> 37:15.314
<i>in the Oak Island swamp.</i>

37:15.416 --> 37:17.716
Okay, we're gonna get
Craig on the screen?

37:17.785 --> 37:22.254
Yep. Got him right here.
Hopefully it's good news.

37:22.356 --> 37:25.091
- Hi, Craig!
- Hey, Craig!

37:25.193 --> 37:26.559
Hi, Guys. How's it going?

37:26.661 --> 37:28.227
- Good!
- Good.

37:28.329 --> 37:31.530
Looking for the results on
the carbon testing on that

37:31.632 --> 37:33.232
plank that Tony pulled
out of the swamp.

37:33.334 --> 37:35.835
- Talk to us about it.
- Make it good, Craig.

37:35.937 --> 37:39.872
Okay. Well, I got results
back from Beta Analytic.

37:39.974 --> 37:41.607
It's coming in a range,

37:41.709 --> 37:44.343
and this again
is a 95 percentile

37:44.445 --> 37:48.848
anywhere from 1680 to 1735.

37:48.950 --> 37:50.616
Wow.

37:50.718 --> 37:53.752
It's positive data in that
some of the dating could

37:53.855 --> 37:56.355
fit with some of the theories.

37:56.457 --> 37:59.892
Yeah, we're in an area where
it could be the original people

37:59.994 --> 38:04.096
- from 1680 to 1735.
- Right.

38:04.198 --> 38:08.400
Well, look if it was
1680 to 1735, for sure,

38:08.503 --> 38:09.768
that would be exciting,

38:09.871 --> 38:11.670
because that means
there were people here.

38:11.772 --> 38:13.405
They were here doing stuff.

38:17.245 --> 38:19.211
<i>Could Rick, Marty and the team</i>

38:19.313 --> 38:21.113
<i>really have found evidence</i>

38:21.215 --> 38:25.384
<i>linking the large wooden plank
they found to theories that</i>

38:25.486 --> 38:28.654
<i>an ancient ship carried
treasure to Oak Island,</i>

38:28.756 --> 38:33.159
<i>and was then deliberately sunk
and hidden in a man-made swamp?</i>

38:35.396 --> 38:38.230
If you remember,
Fred found parts of a ship,

38:38.332 --> 38:40.132
there's parts of a
spar he found in there,

38:40.234 --> 38:42.768
and also a section of a
ship called a scuppers.

38:42.870 --> 38:44.503
True.

38:44.605 --> 38:47.673
So, is there any chance that
pirates or some other ships,

38:47.775 --> 38:51.911
maybe unrelated to the search,
crashed,

38:52.013 --> 38:55.981
or they left some sort
of wood in the swamp?

38:56.083 --> 38:57.249
Those things have two-inch,

38:57.351 --> 38:58.984
three-inch four-inch
planks on them.

38:59.086 --> 39:01.687
I mean they were, they were
ocean liners of their time.

39:01.789 --> 39:04.623
- Unless it was a top deck.
- Well, yeah. I mean, of course.

39:04.725 --> 39:06.358
There'd be ceiling boards

39:06.460 --> 39:08.494
and floorboards,
and all kinds of stuff.

39:08.596 --> 39:09.907
Well look, as far
as I'm concerned

39:09.931 --> 39:11.764
I think there's
something in the swamp.

39:11.866 --> 39:15.267
It's the fact that Tony Sampson
didn't find anything that

39:15.369 --> 39:17.102
makes me wanna dig in the swamp,

39:17.205 --> 39:20.472
because we have the EM61 thing
that senses very deep and it

39:20.575 --> 39:22.841
senses something metallic.

39:22.944 --> 39:25.644
And then Tony sweeps the bottom
and he doesn't get anything.

39:25.746 --> 39:27.846
Well, that means that
there's something deeper.

39:27.949 --> 39:32.518
Something that must be dug.
So, let's go dig it.

39:32.620 --> 39:34.486
We have a hard target.

39:34.589 --> 39:37.189
We have our best target.
We have the equipment.

39:37.291 --> 39:39.692
We have the permits.
We're gonna go dig it up.

39:39.794 --> 39:41.860
So, it's going to be gratifying.

39:41.963 --> 39:44.863
I never thought I'd say it,
but I want to dig in the swamp.

39:44.966 --> 39:46.665
He's happy to be back.

39:46.767 --> 39:49.401
Happy to be back in the swamp.
Who would have guessed it?

39:49.503 --> 39:53.072
We're still faced with the
most significant thing we found

39:53.174 --> 39:55.874
has been in the swamp,
I mean it has.

39:55.977 --> 39:58.310
The coin is the most
significant thing.

39:58.412 --> 40:00.913
Well, the coconut
fiber in Smith's Cove.

40:01.015 --> 40:04.083
Well, I'll take
David's position on that.

40:06.287 --> 40:09.088
So, we drain. You do your dig.

40:09.190 --> 40:10.322
Could be a perfect year.

40:10.424 --> 40:11.657
- Right.
- Yup.

40:11.759 --> 40:13.425
Okay. Well, let's call
this one quits.

40:13.494 --> 40:16.729
Thanks for the data, Craig.
It helps us move forward,

40:16.831 --> 40:18.030
and let's go move forward.

40:18.132 --> 40:20.566
- Sounds good!
- Alright thanks, Craig.

40:20.668 --> 40:21.668
Bye, guys.

40:21.769 --> 40:23.736
- See ya, Craig.
- See ya, Craig!

40:26.841 --> 40:29.575
<i>For brothers Rick
and Marty Lagina,</i>

40:29.677 --> 40:33.545
<i>their life-long dream of solving
the Oak Island mystery seems</i>

40:33.648 --> 40:37.016
<i>closer to being realized
than ever before.</i>

40:37.118 --> 40:41.754
<i>So far this year, they have
discovered numerous clues...</i>

40:41.856 --> 40:44.189
<i>maps... and carvings...</i>

40:44.292 --> 40:46.625
<i>that point to activity
on the island...</i>

40:46.727 --> 40:49.028
<i>Hundreds of years ago.</i>

40:49.130 --> 40:51.630
<i>And they have only just
scratched the surface</i>

40:51.732 --> 40:54.233
<i>in their excavation
of the Money Pit,</i>

40:54.335 --> 40:57.202
<i>the place where
everything started.</i>

40:57.305 --> 41:00.172
<i>But, if their efforts are
successful,</i>

41:00.241 --> 41:02.608
<i>what will they find?</i>

41:02.710 --> 41:04.510
<i>Pirate treasure?</i>

41:04.578 --> 41:06.912
<i>Sacred religious artifacts?</i>

41:07.014 --> 41:10.282
<i>Or could it be something so
incredible,</i>

41:10.384 --> 41:13.619
<i>it will forever change
everything we think we know</i>

41:13.721 --> 41:15.421
<i>about our history?</i>

41:15.523 --> 41:17.990
<i>One thing is certain...</i>

41:18.092 --> 41:21.493
<i>whatever it is will
only be discovered...</i>

41:21.595 --> 41:26.465
<i>when the island is ready
to reveal it.</i>

41:28.602 --> 41:31.503
<i>Next time on The Curse
of Oak Island...</i>

41:31.605 --> 41:34.239
We've found the location
of the 90-foot stone.

41:34.342 --> 41:36.008
The stone that was
brought up from the.

41:36.110 --> 41:37.510
Money Pit with an inscription
on it.

41:37.611 --> 41:39.478
This is it, right straight
ahead.

41:39.580 --> 41:41.758
- It's like a maze down here.
- Yeah, jeez, look at this place.

41:41.782 --> 41:43.115
Come take a look at this.

41:43.217 --> 41:44.428
- Whatchya got here?
- It's a big stone.

41:44.452 --> 41:46.919
- Look at that.
- Here they come!

41:47.054 --> 41:48.153
Today is when it begins.

41:48.255 --> 41:49.488
We're going to dig a big hole

41:49.590 --> 41:51.034
in the Money Pit
find out what's there.

41:51.058 --> 41:53.859
- Right, brother?
- Absolutely. It's go time.

41:53.961 --> 41:56.095
- Here we go.
- Make hole!
