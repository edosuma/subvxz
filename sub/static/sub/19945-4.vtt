WEBVTT

00:56.431 --> 00:59.685
That was a good idea, Frankie.
We really needed that.

00:59.768 --> 01:02.688
Like I always say, if you can
create a viable vibrator business

01:02.771 --> 01:05.857
with your best friend,
then go to Extraordinary Desserts

01:05.941 --> 01:07.150
and get your freak on.

01:07.234 --> 01:10.237
Is that what you call snorting
a whole line of powdered sugar?

01:10.320 --> 01:12.531
That was an accident.

01:16.660 --> 01:20.497
I am riding a pretty serious sugar high.

01:20.581 --> 01:23.375
What do you say
we try to get some work done?

01:23.458 --> 01:26.169
I'd love to,
but I'm kind of swamped tonight.

01:26.253 --> 01:28.505
Is that what you call needing
to catch up on<i> Ray Donovan?</i>

01:28.588 --> 01:30.132
You're damn right.

01:30.215 --> 01:33.010
Now, you can watch with me,
but just remember, the rules are:

01:33.093 --> 01:37.556
No talking about how handsome
Liev Schreiber is during the show.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.266
We talk about it after.

01:39.349 --> 01:40.475
Really? You think he's handsome?

01:40.559 --> 01:42.436
Yes, he's handsome!

01:42.519 --> 01:43.854
I mean, he's not not-handsome.

01:43.937 --> 01:48.233
Now, Grace, that's exactly the kind of
conversation you save for after the show.

01:55.866 --> 01:57.784
Grace, do you have the TV?

01:57.868 --> 01:59.578
Yeah, it's in my purse.

01:59.703 --> 02:02.414
Do you... Do you have my laptop?

02:02.497 --> 02:05.375
I'm still on the TV.
One mystery at a time.

02:05.459 --> 02:06.877
Yours isn't here, either.

02:07.753 --> 02:10.213
Both of our laptops were right here.

02:13.842 --> 02:15.802
Oh, my God! We've been robbed!

02:16.261 --> 02:18.972
Maybe they're still in the house. Frankie?

02:19.556 --> 02:20.515
Frankie?

02:23.185 --> 02:25.687
-Frankie?
-Get out of the house, Grace!

02:25.771 --> 02:27.230
Take to the water!

02:28.565 --> 02:29.733
Huh.

02:43.997 --> 02:47.042
Are you sure you guys are okay?
Can I get you anything?

02:47.125 --> 02:48.502
We're fine.

02:48.585 --> 02:51.213
All I wanted was to watch<i> Ray Donovan.</i>

02:51.296 --> 02:55.050
How will I ever find out if he fixed
all the things that needed fixing?

02:55.133 --> 02:57.594
She doesn't seem fine.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.304
Well, you were definitely robbed.

02:59.388 --> 03:01.973
Oh, I think you've got the goods
to make detective.

03:02.057 --> 03:03.392
I am a detective.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.852
Mom? Mom, it's okay.

03:05.936 --> 03:10.816
They didn't take any of my... your...
the... jewelry.

03:10.899 --> 03:14.569
They didn't take the jewelry that you
were going to give me or whatever.

03:14.653 --> 03:17.697
-Oh, my God. How are you guys?
-We are fine.

03:17.781 --> 03:20.242
I honestly don't know
why you girls came here.

03:20.325 --> 03:22.035
Because we've been violated

03:22.119 --> 03:26.415
and my false sense of security
has been destroyed forever.

03:26.498 --> 03:27.707
Frankie, buck up.

03:27.791 --> 03:28.708
Oh, buck up.

03:28.792 --> 03:30.752
I don't care about anything
but the laptops.

03:30.836 --> 03:33.588
Ma'am, there's little chance
you'll get your computers back.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.048
How little?

03:35.132 --> 03:36.466
Teeny tiny.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.927
Okay, zero.

03:39.010 --> 03:40.637
Oh, unbelievable!

03:40.721 --> 03:43.140
My homeowner's insurance
doesn't cover laptops

03:43.223 --> 03:45.767
and this one doesn't insure anything
except her geodes.

03:46.309 --> 03:48.270
Now, is it just the two of you
alone in the house?

03:48.353 --> 03:50.355
Why? Do you think they could come back?

03:50.439 --> 03:54.568
Because all there is is little old me
and this dusty bag of elbows!

03:55.360 --> 03:57.946
It's very unlikely, but not unheard of.

03:58.029 --> 04:00.115
What are you saying? Am I in danger?

04:00.198 --> 04:03.285
Because I will go back
and hide in the ocean right now!

04:03.368 --> 04:04.202
Don't test me!

04:04.286 --> 04:06.455
Would you please sit on her or something?

04:06.538 --> 04:08.415
Do you have anywhere
you can stay for the night?

04:09.040 --> 04:12.669
Jacob picked the worst possible week
to go out of town.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.337
Where can we stay?

04:15.964 --> 04:19.050
Oh, the Disney Hilton!
Oh, please, please?

04:19.134 --> 04:21.636
You can stay with me.
We have plenty of room.

04:22.137 --> 04:24.181
Quick warning, though.
Macklin's night terrors are back,

04:24.264 --> 04:26.767
the twins aren't sleeping through
the night, and Madison has the croup.

04:26.850 --> 04:28.226
It's a barking cough.

04:28.310 --> 04:31.730
Or you can stay at my place.
I won't, but you can.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.398
Girls, we're fine.

04:33.482 --> 04:37.110
A couple of hooligans are not going
to scare us away. This is our home.

04:37.194 --> 04:40.906
So just go back to your respective
nightmares and I'll stay with mine.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.616
-Go! Go!
-Okay.

04:42.699 --> 04:45.118
Should I take the jewelry with me?
'Cause it might be safer--

04:45.202 --> 04:47.329
-Go! Right now!
-We'll talk about it later. Okay.

04:50.624 --> 04:55.128
Christ on a cupcake, I just noticed
how many windows there are in this house.

04:55.212 --> 04:58.340
Why are there so many windows?
We are sitting ducks!

04:58.423 --> 05:00.675
Well, if it can give you
some peace of mind,

05:00.759 --> 05:04.513
there's a great crime prevention class
for seniors down at the community center.

05:04.596 --> 05:05.764
Great. Can I sleep there?

05:05.847 --> 05:07.724
Oh, thank you for your advice.
We're fine.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.519
Okay. I just have one more question.

05:10.602 --> 05:14.231
Do you own a firearm,
and if so, was it stolen?

05:14.314 --> 05:15.148
No.

05:15.774 --> 05:18.610
No, you don't own a firearm
or no, it wasn't stolen?

05:18.693 --> 05:19.694
Yes.

05:20.278 --> 05:22.197
-I'm confused.
-Correct.

05:22.280 --> 05:25.033
Of course we don't have a gun!
Are you insane?

05:25.116 --> 05:27.035
Do you think we'd have a gun?

05:27.118 --> 05:30.956
Do you think we'd let a gun
come into the house in a million years?

05:31.039 --> 05:32.582
I don't know you.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.459
-Oh, Grace, tell him!
-Tell him what?

05:34.543 --> 05:38.296
That we don't have a gun!
That we would never have a gun.

05:40.632 --> 05:42.467
-Grace?
-What?

05:45.178 --> 05:46.596
Do you own a gun?

05:46.680 --> 05:47.889
No.

05:49.891 --> 05:51.434
You're gonna have to promise me.

05:51.518 --> 05:53.186
I promise.

05:53.270 --> 05:54.688
The way I like it.

05:59.776 --> 06:04.030
Frankie, I promise I do not have a gun
nor will I ever have one.

06:04.114 --> 06:05.282
You do not need to worry.

06:06.575 --> 06:09.327
Thank you. Now finish it off.

06:14.416 --> 06:15.959
Promise accepted.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.752
Namaste.

06:18.962 --> 06:21.423
-You and your wife are adorable.
-Thank you.

06:26.845 --> 06:29.139
-So, you have a gun, right?
-Oh, yeah.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.140
Stolen?

06:30.223 --> 06:32.100
No. It's in a safe upstairs.

06:32.183 --> 06:33.184
Copy that.

06:35.604 --> 06:39.858
And the girl that was here earlier, not
the obvious man-eater, but the nice one?

06:39.941 --> 06:41.818
She's married with four children.

06:41.902 --> 06:44.446
Yep. Mm-hmm.

06:45.196 --> 06:46.573
And the man-eater?

06:46.656 --> 06:47.657
Goodnight, officer.

06:51.119 --> 06:53.747
For the last time, she's fine.

06:53.830 --> 06:58.084
<i> Fine? I know Frankie,</i>
<i>and there's no way she's fine right now.</i>

06:58.168 --> 07:00.754
Try putting a hot compress on her head.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.339
That always helps calm her down.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.759
The same hot compress
she puts down her pants? Pass.

07:05.842 --> 07:07.886
Did you at least rub her sternum?

07:07.969 --> 07:12.390
I tried, but she kept moaning
and it... confused me.

07:12.474 --> 07:14.225
Did you pull her pinky toes?

07:14.309 --> 07:15.769
Same answer there, Sol.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.479
And you're sure you're all right?

07:17.562 --> 07:18.647
<i>We're fine.</i>

07:18.730 --> 07:22.275
Because you can both stay here.
I'm sure it's okay with Robert.

07:22.359 --> 07:26.446
I can't ask him because he's out
rehearsing every night.

07:26.529 --> 07:28.949
Now I know how Lucy Ricardo felt.

07:29.032 --> 07:30.450
Although, I always knew.

07:31.618 --> 07:34.829
-Maybe you guys should come over.
<i>-Look, everything's fine.</i>

07:34.913 --> 07:38.500
Frankie went to bed with minimal fuss.
I'm about to pass out.

07:38.583 --> 07:41.753
So thank you for your concern,
but we don't need your help.

07:41.836 --> 07:43.755
-I got it covered.
<i>-You haven't seen this place.</i>

07:43.838 --> 07:45.131
-Uh-huh.
<i>-It's very comfortable.</i>

07:45.215 --> 07:47.175
-Uh-huh.
<i>-We could play a game.</i>

07:47.258 --> 07:49.552
<i>- We could do, you know, whatever--</i>

07:59.270 --> 08:00.814
Okay, let's hit the hay.

08:00.897 --> 08:03.984
You want right side or left?
I call middle.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.735
Oh, you've got to be kidding.

08:06.444 --> 08:09.531
Oh, would you rather us both
sleep in my studio?

08:09.614 --> 08:12.492
Cool with me, though there is a bit
of unaccounted-for vindaloo

08:12.575 --> 08:13.994
somewhere in my bed.

08:15.161 --> 08:16.329
No.

08:16.413 --> 08:18.331
I will sleep in my bed.

08:19.082 --> 08:22.460
You will sleep with the Indian food,
like always.

08:22.544 --> 08:24.587
Okay, okay. Let's make a deal.

08:24.671 --> 08:27.465
I sleep with you and you let me.

08:28.216 --> 08:31.344
Look, those idiots
are not coming back anytime soon.

08:31.428 --> 08:34.139
Oh, you don't know that.

08:34.222 --> 08:36.141
What if they realize
they forgot to take

08:36.224 --> 08:39.102
my antique roll
of Civil War authentic twine?

08:40.186 --> 08:44.232
I wouldn't worry, it's pretty cleverly
disguised as garbage.

08:49.029 --> 08:52.407
What is the matter?
Why can't you get control of yourself?

08:52.490 --> 08:56.161
I don't know. I can't stop thinking
about how vulnerable we are.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.413
-Doesn't it bother you?
-Honestly?

08:59.456 --> 09:02.500
Not really. I'm fine.

09:03.418 --> 09:05.045
Well, I decidedly am not.

09:06.254 --> 09:09.424
I haven't felt this way... maybe ever.

09:10.592 --> 09:13.887
Please, Grace,
let me stay here for one night.

09:13.970 --> 09:15.889
-I need you.
-Oh, fine.

09:15.972 --> 09:17.432
Oh, yippee!

09:17.515 --> 09:20.143
-This is a one night only thing.
-Totally agreed.

09:20.226 --> 09:23.104
Three weeks, max, barring any setbacks.

09:23.605 --> 09:26.316
Full disclosure,
there's gonna be setbacks.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.526
Would it help you
get your head on straight

09:28.610 --> 09:32.155
if we took
that crime prevention class for seniors?

09:32.238 --> 09:34.949
-Will you do it with me?
-Will it get you out of my bed?

09:35.033 --> 09:38.620
-Super probably.
-Then... good enough.

09:41.331 --> 09:42.457
Good night, Frankie.

09:42.957 --> 09:47.295
Mmm, nighty-night-night.
Night, night, night--

09:47.378 --> 09:48.546
Frankie!

09:48.630 --> 09:49.798
Sorry.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.009
Night.

09:54.010 --> 09:57.055
Night, night.

10:02.519 --> 10:03.937
Ta-da!

10:04.437 --> 10:05.730
Holy moly.

10:05.814 --> 10:06.689
I heard the car.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.984
Ta... da.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.571
Thank you and what is it?

10:13.655 --> 10:14.864
It's a pink squirrel.

10:15.782 --> 10:18.701
I accidentally bought strawberry milk
at the grocery store

10:18.785 --> 10:20.912
and now I have to get rid of it.

10:21.496 --> 10:25.250
So... can you believe this robbery?

10:26.042 --> 10:29.879
We had that house for 20 years, nothing.
Never a problem.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.548
They have the house for 18 months

10:31.631 --> 10:34.801
and all of a sudden
it's<i> The Wire</i> over there.

10:34.884 --> 10:37.303
Sol, the girls told me all about it.

10:37.387 --> 10:39.514
I called Grace
and she said everything is fine.

10:39.597 --> 10:41.391
Great. I don't need to talk about it.

10:41.474 --> 10:44.352
I can talk about other things.
How was rehearsal?

10:44.435 --> 10:46.563
Did you learn more blocking?

10:46.646 --> 10:49.691
-I can speak the lingo.
-Rehearsal's fine.

10:49.774 --> 10:53.361
We just started to get it up on its feet,
but it's early yet.

10:53.945 --> 10:55.238
I'm so glad you're home.

10:55.822 --> 10:59.576
I've been saving us
the last episode of<i> Dance Moms.</i>

10:59.659 --> 11:02.620
-Oh, there are more of them?
-Oh.

11:03.329 --> 11:06.291
We can watch anything.
What are you in the mood for?

11:06.374 --> 11:08.877
Honestly, I'm in the mood for bed.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.461
Well, that can be arranged.

11:10.545 --> 11:12.755
I don't think I have it
in me tonight, Sol.

11:12.839 --> 11:15.008
You might if you downed
that pink squirrel.

11:15.091 --> 11:18.261
You know, honey, as much as I love
gin and milk, I am whooped.

11:18.344 --> 11:21.222
I just spent two straight hours
in rehearsal.

11:21.306 --> 11:23.683
Two hours?
You told me it was 7:00 to 10:00.

11:23.766 --> 11:26.686
Oh, well, right.

11:26.769 --> 11:29.606
Two hours of rehearsal, then vocalizing,

11:29.689 --> 11:31.024
then an hour of drinkies.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.026
-"Drinkies"?
-Mm-hmm.

11:33.902 --> 11:35.528
What-- What-- What--

11:35.612 --> 11:36.946
What do you mean "drinkies"?

11:37.030 --> 11:40.992
Well, you know... post-rehearsal drinks.

11:41.701 --> 11:47.415
You know, it's the brotherhood
of the stage, bonding and the such.

11:47.498 --> 11:50.210
You padded your rehearsal time.

11:50.293 --> 11:53.504
I most certainly did not.
It's part of the theatrical tradition.

11:53.588 --> 11:56.049
Dates back to Roman times, probably.

11:56.633 --> 11:59.010
Well, I guess we won't be needing these.

12:01.429 --> 12:05.683
I wanted to invite you for drinkies,
but spouses don't come.

12:05.767 --> 12:11.189
Not only am I not good enough to play
Silent Guy with Spittoon,

12:11.272 --> 12:13.107
I can't even do drinkies.

12:16.319 --> 12:19.239
You know what? You can do drinkies.

12:19.322 --> 12:20.823
-And you know why?
-Why?

12:20.907 --> 12:24.661
Because drinkies
are coming here tomorrow night.

12:25.620 --> 12:26.746
No, they're not.

12:26.829 --> 12:29.666
Oh, yes they are. I just decided.

12:31.042 --> 12:32.377
May I make pink squirrels?

12:32.585 --> 12:35.129
You may certainly not.

12:35.838 --> 12:37.632
Good night, sweetheart.

12:42.178 --> 12:43.554
They're good!

12:45.264 --> 12:48.059
In fact, some of the things
that make you less safe

12:48.142 --> 12:49.769
you don't even realize you're doing.

12:50.353 --> 12:52.605
-Yes?
-Officer Tuttle? Frankie Bergstein.

12:52.689 --> 12:54.774
Frankie, you don't have to say your name
every time you have a question.

12:54.857 --> 12:56.234
What's your question?

12:57.694 --> 12:58.987
-I forgot.
-Great.

12:59.070 --> 13:03.783
Uh, number one: avoid grocery shopping
between the hours of 5:00 and 8:00 p.m.

13:03.866 --> 13:08.162
I live in a home. They take us
grocery shopping in a bus.

13:09.372 --> 13:11.749
-Mel Cordray.
-Okay, class announcement:

13:11.833 --> 13:14.377
you don't have to say your name
every time you have a question.

13:14.460 --> 13:19.007
Excuse me. Between 5:00 and 8:00
are prime sample hours at Trader Joe's.

13:19.507 --> 13:23.720
Okay, moving on.
Avoid mall bathrooms at all costs.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.555
Where am I supposed to eat my Cinnabon?

13:25.638 --> 13:28.391
For the last time, at the Cinnabon!

13:28.474 --> 13:31.853
Oh, my God! I do all those things!
I'm a walking target!

13:31.936 --> 13:34.731
-You're not a walking target.
-Actually, I'm afraid she is.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.482
-Wait, I am?
-Thanks a lot, Tuttle.

13:36.566 --> 13:38.735
Would you please stand up here
for a moment?

13:38.818 --> 13:40.445
Don't make her stand up.

13:42.071 --> 13:44.407
I'd like everyone to pay attention
to what we're dealing with here.

13:44.490 --> 13:47.994
First, the loose fabric,
very easy to grab.

13:48.077 --> 13:50.663
The clogs make it
virtually impossible to run away.

13:50.747 --> 13:51.998
They have springs.

13:52.957 --> 13:55.918
If she had a ponytail,
she'd be a prowler's delight.

13:56.002 --> 13:57.420
What is this, a roast?

13:57.503 --> 14:00.339
Officer,
questionable wardrobe choices aside,

14:00.423 --> 14:03.509
Frankie is a lot less vulnerable
than she looks.

14:03.593 --> 14:05.887
I mean, in fact, she's extremely vigilant.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.346
-Really?
-Absolutely.

14:07.430 --> 14:10.475
I've heard her give out her home address
at least three times since she got here.

14:10.558 --> 14:13.102
-Fair enough.
-I'm not safe anywhere.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.146
You'd be safe with old Mel Cordray.

14:15.229 --> 14:17.065
Look, you seem like you're a lot of fun

14:17.148 --> 14:20.651
and obviously I want
to hear all about this grocery bus,

14:20.735 --> 14:23.571
but this is not the time
and this is not the place.

14:23.654 --> 14:25.198
I really miss the kindergartners.

14:25.281 --> 14:30.411
Officer, my friend is upset because
we had a home invasion and were robbed.

14:30.495 --> 14:33.164
Isn't there anything you can do
to put her mind at ease?

14:33.247 --> 14:36.542
Yes, that. That.
I want to hear all about that.

14:36.626 --> 14:40.671
Okay. The key there is to make it look
like somebody's always home.

14:40.755 --> 14:43.341
Oh, yes, always home.
Never leaving. Got it.

14:43.424 --> 14:45.968
A burglar is 90 percent less likely
to enter the home

14:46.052 --> 14:47.720
if they think that someone is awake.

14:47.804 --> 14:50.556
We've got to be awake constantly.

14:50.640 --> 14:53.601
So here are some things you can do
to create the illusion

14:53.684 --> 14:55.269
that someone is always awake.

14:55.353 --> 14:57.188
Of course. That makes more sense.

14:58.689 --> 15:02.860
You can leave a light on.
You can install a motion detector light.

15:02.944 --> 15:05.071
You can leave a TV on low
when you go to bed.

15:05.655 --> 15:08.449
Another thing you could do is leave
a large pair of men's boots

15:08.533 --> 15:09.867
outside the front door.

15:09.951 --> 15:11.994
That gives the appearance
that there's a man at home.

15:12.078 --> 15:15.415
What if we come face to face
with an intruder in the house?

15:15.498 --> 15:18.835
Well, it's extremely important that you do
not try to engage the intruder physically.

15:18.918 --> 15:22.422
At your advanced age, you're not going
to be able to win a hand-to-hand fight.

15:22.505 --> 15:24.006
Why not? What about adrenaline?

15:24.090 --> 15:27.468
I mean, what about women
who pick up a car to save a child?

15:27.552 --> 15:30.179
Yeah, well, I think that ship
has pretty much sailed.

15:31.722 --> 15:33.516
If somebody has entered your home,

15:33.599 --> 15:37.103
the first thing you want to do
is say your full name very loud.

15:37.186 --> 15:38.312
Frankie Bergstein!

15:41.649 --> 15:43.734
Then your best bet is to go ahead
and soil yourself.

15:45.570 --> 15:46.446
Excuse me?

15:46.529 --> 15:48.656
-What if you don't have to go?
-Oh, you'll have to go.

15:48.739 --> 15:51.701
Soil my-- Soil myself?

15:51.784 --> 15:54.454
It's not pretty, but it's
the most proven and effective method

15:54.537 --> 15:56.747
to ensure that an attacker
will not want to touch you.

15:57.832 --> 15:59.125
Soil myself.

16:00.334 --> 16:03.546
Speaking of... Excuse me.

16:03.629 --> 16:06.591
-Soil myself.
-It would just be for once.

16:21.063 --> 16:24.525
Did Janet Reno finally accept
Frankie's dinner invitation?

16:24.609 --> 16:27.445
No, no. Those are because of the class
that you guys took.

16:27.528 --> 16:29.780
I think it was supposed
to be men's shoes, but, uh,

16:29.864 --> 16:31.782
Mom thought that was too heteronormative.

16:31.866 --> 16:33.910
Guys, I was going to hire someone
to fix that.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.287
No, we YouTubed how to fix
a pane of glass. It's good as new.

16:36.370 --> 16:39.790
Plus, Mom is convinced that
the entire handyman industry is a scam

16:39.874 --> 16:42.126
for thieves to gain access
into your house.

16:42.210 --> 16:46.172
Do either of you foresee your mother
returning to any level of normalcy soon?

16:46.255 --> 16:47.381
Define "normalcy."

16:48.716 --> 16:51.177
- Where is she?
- She's right here.

16:51.260 --> 16:53.429
Oh, Frankie, we said no booby traps.

16:53.513 --> 16:56.557
Oh, this is gonna be much better
than any booby trap.

16:56.641 --> 16:58.976
Boys, thanks for installing our new TVs.

16:59.060 --> 17:01.312
One's upside down but I can fix it.

17:01.395 --> 17:03.231
-I told you it was upside down.
-Shut the fuck up.

17:03.314 --> 17:05.066
-So you're feeling better?
-I am.

17:05.149 --> 17:08.611
Great. So what are we doing
with all that?

17:08.694 --> 17:11.030
Oh, this?
This is just to weigh her down.

17:12.406 --> 17:13.324
What?

17:37.848 --> 17:40.393
You do have memorable hair.

17:41.269 --> 17:43.813
Mmm.

17:43.896 --> 17:49.026
Oh, Sol, how do you do it?
The crust is fluffy and crunchy.

17:49.110 --> 17:50.987
You have really outdone yourself.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.656
You don't have to go overboard
with compliments.

17:53.739 --> 17:58.035
You didn't cast me in the play
and now I'm co-hosting drinkies.

17:58.119 --> 17:59.829
It's awkward.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.123
Only if we talk about it more.

18:02.707 --> 18:04.500
All right.
What do you want to talk about?

18:14.260 --> 18:15.886
God, it's still awkward, isn't it?

18:15.970 --> 18:17.638
-Let's go join the others!
-Okay.

18:18.431 --> 18:22.768
No, no. Gwen Verdon did not win a Tony
for<i> Sweet Charity</i> in 1966.

18:22.852 --> 18:24.228
I think it's Ver-don.

18:24.312 --> 18:26.397
It's Verdon. Look it up, please.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.524
Angela Lansbury won that year for<i> Mame.</i>

18:28.608 --> 18:30.484
Wait, I thought she had four.

18:30.568 --> 18:31.611
She did.

18:31.694 --> 18:34.947
<i>Can-Can, Damn Yankees,</i>
<i>New Girl in Town,</i> and<i> Redhead.</i>

18:35.031 --> 18:36.866
Come on. Give me a real challenge.

18:36.949 --> 18:39.869
Let's try Zero Mostel or Patti LuPon.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.996
It's LuPone. Look it up.

18:42.913 --> 18:45.833
You're unbelievable.
Sol, I hope you know how lucky you are

18:45.916 --> 18:48.878
to live with someone with this kind
of information at his fingertips.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.921
I try not to bore Sol with my gift.

18:51.005 --> 18:53.424
I'm never bored. Confused, sometimes.

18:53.507 --> 18:57.887
And often wondering how Grace
never figured out he was gay

18:57.970 --> 18:58.929
for all those years.

19:00.389 --> 19:01.682
Wait. Who's Grace?

19:01.766 --> 19:03.225
-Grace is--
-Grace Kelly.

19:03.934 --> 19:06.812
Star of<i> High Society,</i> 1956.

19:06.896 --> 19:08.689
Musical version of
<i>The Philadelphia Story.</i>

19:08.773 --> 19:10.983
And also Robert's wife of 40 years.

19:14.528 --> 19:15.780
I'm sorry, what?

19:16.864 --> 19:17.782
You were married?

19:18.574 --> 19:19.492
To a woman?

19:19.575 --> 19:21.911
-We both were.
-Can I get a refill?

19:22.495 --> 19:24.121
You guys don't know this?

19:25.331 --> 19:28.000
Robert, how did this not come up
in share circle?

19:28.084 --> 19:30.920
Or at least how did this not come up
in drunk share circle?

19:32.421 --> 19:35.174
-I guess I wasn't drunk enough.
-You were pretty drunk.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.302
We neither of us really lead with it.

19:38.386 --> 19:40.054
But there it is.

19:43.849 --> 19:44.850
Let's get into it.

19:44.934 --> 19:47.228
This is why I don't bring Jeff
to drinkies.

19:47.311 --> 19:48.771
Tell us everything!

19:58.364 --> 20:00.324
-Hey, girl!
-Oh, no, no, no.

20:00.408 --> 20:03.494
Frankie, don't even think about
getting into this bed. I need sleep!

20:04.120 --> 20:06.497
Oh, relax. I just can't find my glasses.

20:06.580 --> 20:08.207
Think I left them here. Mind?

20:08.290 --> 20:10.042
Fine. Make it quick.

20:11.293 --> 20:15.047
I feel so much better
thanks to that class.

20:15.131 --> 20:20.010
Gave me so many good ideas
to secure our perimeters.

20:20.094 --> 20:21.595
Our perimeters, right.

20:21.679 --> 20:26.559
I only have one thing more to do
to make us fully secure for the night.

20:27.143 --> 20:28.352
And what might that be?

20:29.186 --> 20:32.314
-No Frankie! Frankie, no!
-I'm in! I'm in! I'm in! I'm already in!

20:32.398 --> 20:33.441
You can't kick me out!

20:33.524 --> 20:34.984
-Squatter's rights!
-Oh, God.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.361
I thought you were fine! Be fine!

20:37.445 --> 20:40.573
I am fine. During the day.

20:40.656 --> 20:43.576
It turns out I'm just less fine at night.

20:43.659 --> 20:45.369
You snore. You talk in your sleep.

20:46.620 --> 20:50.249
Last night you kept saying,
"Let's get you out of that skin."

20:50.332 --> 20:51.834
Must have freaked you out, huh?

20:51.917 --> 20:53.252
Get out!

20:53.335 --> 20:56.380
No, wait! Wait! Don't push me out!

20:56.464 --> 20:58.466
-Please.
-No, please.

20:58.549 --> 21:00.843
We can solve this.

21:02.136 --> 21:03.763
Do you want me to do stuff to you?

21:03.846 --> 21:06.015
Oh, stop asking me that!

21:06.432 --> 21:07.516
I don't hear a "no."

21:07.600 --> 21:09.310
Oh, fucking hell, Frankie!

21:09.393 --> 21:12.104
Are you gonna make me
physically remove you from this room?

21:12.188 --> 21:14.315
Because I took
an extra Boniva this morning.

21:15.441 --> 21:16.859
You're really not scared?

21:16.942 --> 21:20.237
I'm scared of some things.
Death comes to mind.

21:20.321 --> 21:23.115
But, no, I'm not scared now.
And I'll tell you something.

21:23.199 --> 21:26.327
As long as you have me,
you don't need to be scared, either.

21:27.328 --> 21:29.955
-I don't know.
-Oh, cut the crap.

21:30.039 --> 21:33.083
Come on. The Frankie I know
is an ass-kicker.

21:33.167 --> 21:36.796
The Frankie I know
never met a phobia she couldn't beat.

21:36.879 --> 21:39.840
-She drives the freeways.
-Oh, yeah, but I almost killed that guy.

21:39.924 --> 21:42.384
She started a relationship with a new man.

21:42.468 --> 21:44.512
A farmer, no less.

21:44.595 --> 21:45.846
I do rock his world.

21:45.930 --> 21:48.432
She started a business in her 70s,
for Christ's sake.

21:48.516 --> 21:49.892
I did all those things.

21:49.975 --> 21:51.352
You're damn right you did.

21:51.435 --> 21:53.813
And you know what all those victories
have in common?

21:53.896 --> 21:55.397
A series of lost purses?

21:56.106 --> 21:57.107
You.

21:57.191 --> 22:00.361
I couldn't have done
any of that without you.

22:00.444 --> 22:03.239
You make me feel strong, Grace Hanson.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.115
Like I could do anything.

22:06.325 --> 22:09.620
-Well, I'm glad you feel better.
-Me, too. Nighty night.

22:09.703 --> 22:11.789
I thought you were going
to sleep in your bed.

22:11.872 --> 22:13.958
I thought since I was already here...

22:14.041 --> 22:15.167
Agh.

22:16.085 --> 22:18.295
Okay, wait here.
I know what we're going to do.

22:19.088 --> 22:20.422
I got these for Macklin.

22:20.506 --> 22:21.674
Don't tell Robert.

22:21.757 --> 22:27.763
I keep a stash of toys that I dole out
when the kids come over.

22:27.846 --> 22:29.306
Walkie-talkies.

22:29.390 --> 22:33.936
I apologize, they've got a picture of
somebody called "André the Giant" on them.

22:34.019 --> 22:36.647
Can you believe what he did
to King Kong Bundy

22:36.730 --> 22:39.775
at the<i> "</i>Colossal Jostle" back in '85?

22:39.858 --> 22:42.570
Well, I'm not a basketball fan,
I'm afraid. Look.

22:42.653 --> 22:46.740
A special channel so that you can
always reach me any time, day or night.

22:46.824 --> 22:48.367
-It's short-wave.
-Yes.

22:48.450 --> 22:51.245
So we never have to be far apart
from each other.

22:51.328 --> 22:53.163
Frankie, I'm going to get you
through this.

22:53.247 --> 22:57.334
I will always be here for you.
I just can't be here for you.

22:59.128 --> 23:00.212
Mmm.

23:01.672 --> 23:03.757
-Frankie, don't abuse them.
-Oh.

23:03.841 --> 23:07.636
Goodnight, Grace. I'll be up and at 'em
first thing for work.

23:07.720 --> 23:10.347
-Like noon?
-Yeah, noon-ish.

23:14.143 --> 23:17.938
Squirrely Chicken has arrived downstairs.
Over and out.

23:20.274 --> 23:22.818
<i>The gazelle seeks</i>
<i>its daily nutritional needs--</i>

23:22.901 --> 23:26.405
<i>The zebras continue</i>
<i>their daily trek along the savannah</i>

23:26.488 --> 23:28.657
<i>seeking out the rain's latest harvest.</i>

23:28.741 --> 23:31.327
I'll come back tomorrow for my car.

23:31.410 --> 23:35.497
I'll take an Uber home
and then another Uber here for my car.

23:35.581 --> 23:38.584
Just leave my car where it is.

23:40.878 --> 23:42.671
Coming!

23:42.755 --> 23:45.132
-Night, Robert.
-Goodbye, Peter.

23:48.636 --> 23:50.929
That poor Uber driver.

23:51.013 --> 23:53.265
-Does Peter live far?
-No.

23:55.392 --> 23:57.770
What's wrong? Are you mad at me?

23:57.853 --> 23:58.771
Yes.

23:58.854 --> 24:00.522
-May I ask why?
-No.

24:02.066 --> 24:05.152
-Yes. You inned me.
-I what?

24:05.235 --> 24:08.530
Inned me! As in reverse outted.

24:09.615 --> 24:12.117
You told all my gay friends
I used to be straight.

24:12.910 --> 24:14.828
-I thought they knew.
-They didn't know!

24:15.454 --> 24:18.999
And when it was obvious they didn't know,
you told them every tawdry detail.

24:20.584 --> 24:23.837
I didn't realize
our life story was tawdry.

24:24.588 --> 24:27.758
I just wanted to be part
of a group of gay friends

24:27.841 --> 24:31.553
where I was gay like they were gay.
Is that asking too much?

24:31.637 --> 24:36.767
They were very understanding.
They know our generation was different.

24:36.850 --> 24:38.769
Sol, it's not about them.

24:38.852 --> 24:40.145
Then what is it about?

24:40.229 --> 24:42.064
-It's about how I feel.
-How do you feel?

24:42.147 --> 24:43.232
I don't know!

24:44.066 --> 24:47.569
I just know that I feel shitty about
all the years I pretended I wasn't gay

24:47.653 --> 24:50.072
and what that did
to all the people that I love.

24:50.155 --> 24:54.034
And now they know that
that's the kind of coward that I am.

24:54.118 --> 24:56.412
But that's what happened.

24:56.495 --> 24:58.163
And we can't pretend it didn't.

24:58.247 --> 25:02.042
I know we can't, but do you have
to discuss it with the whole world?

25:02.126 --> 25:03.794
No, but we shouldn't hide it, either.

25:04.545 --> 25:08.173
Personally, I'm done
with being in any kind of closet.

25:09.800 --> 25:11.844
This is between you and you.

25:42.166 --> 25:45.252
Frankie? Are you in the house?

25:45.335 --> 25:49.673
Negatory, breaker niner.
Squirrely Chicken is in the coop, over.

25:49.757 --> 25:54.720
<i>I need you to stay where you are</i>
<i>and call 911.</i>

25:54.803 --> 25:57.181
Someone is in the house.

25:57.264 --> 25:58.265
What?!

26:42.309 --> 26:44.645
How much of that did you see?

27:38.574 --> 27:40.033
<i>Okay, good night!</i>
