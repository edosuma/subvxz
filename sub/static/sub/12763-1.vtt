00:15.215 --> 00:17.513
<i>My birth was
unconventional at best.</i>

00:22.956 --> 00:25.720
<i>My first memory
was waking up in the forest.</i>

00:26.860 --> 00:30.921
<i>Like a newborn baby, I had no idea
who I was or what was happening.</i>

00:36.403 --> 00:38.963
<i>My eyes weren't sure
what they were seeing.</i>

00:44.310 --> 00:47.609
<i>Every sight, sound and feeling
was unfamiliar.</i>

01:29.989 --> 01:31.889
<i>Every species is born with instincts</i>

01:31.958 --> 01:34.483
<i>that ultimately create
a balance with nature.</i>

01:38.898 --> 01:41.958
<i>Every species,
except the one I was born into.</i>

02:06.126 --> 02:09.095
<i>I came across a beast
with two voices.</i>

02:11.164 --> 02:13.598
<i>I was thankful
to have found a companion.</i>

02:35.221 --> 02:37.883
Come on, sweetie.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.152
Freak.

02:45.498 --> 02:47.329
Show's over, kid.
What's your name?

02:50.603 --> 02:52.298
Who are you?

03:04.684 --> 03:09.246
<i>Soon I was taken to a new place
with fences and sad faces.</i>

03:42.088 --> 03:43.612
Lori?

03:48.194 --> 03:50.094
Lori?

03:51.664 --> 03:52.824
Are you getting up?

03:52.899 --> 03:55.663
Declan!

03:55.768 --> 03:57.599
Like sometime this year?

03:58.805 --> 04:03.105
Let's all have breakfast together
for a change. I'm making pancakes.

04:04.944 --> 04:07.071
I think you slept long enough.

04:14.921 --> 04:18.482
Whew!

04:19.358 --> 04:22.419
We, uh... We didn't get
to finish what we started.

04:22.495 --> 04:24.963
You need to get out of here.

04:27.233 --> 04:29.064
Later, Trager.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.973
Lou, you're not disturbing me.
What's going on?

04:36.042 --> 04:38.408
<i>I've got someone here
you'll want to meet.</i>

04:38.478 --> 04:42.209
The kid showed up here this morning
and he's right up your alley.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.750
In other words,
no one else wants to treat him.

04:44.817 --> 04:47.650
<i>It's not like that.
Nobody knows where he came from.</i>

04:47.720 --> 04:50.348
But he seems sharp and he's...

04:50.423 --> 04:53.449
<i>Look, you gotta see him for yourself.</i>

04:53.526 --> 04:55.289
I'll stop by at 10:00 tomorrow.

04:55.395 --> 04:57.454
Look, um, this afternoon OK?

04:59.899 --> 05:01.764
I'm on my way.

05:05.672 --> 05:08.106
- Ah! It's alive.
- Bite me.

05:08.174 --> 05:10.039
No, thanks.
That's Declan's job.

05:10.109 --> 05:11.474
Shut up, dweeb.

05:11.544 --> 05:13.774
Declan?
What happened to Mike Suby?

05:14.514 --> 05:17.278
Old news.
Declan's her new flavor of the month.

05:17.350 --> 05:19.614
Or of the week,
in Miss Skanky's case.

05:19.686 --> 05:21.984
Knock it off.
So who's this Declan guy?

05:22.055 --> 05:24.546
Just a friend.
He's having a party this week.

05:24.624 --> 05:26.683
- Can I take the car?
- We'll see.

05:26.759 --> 05:29.421
Sorry, guys.
I have to go out for a bit.

05:29.495 --> 05:31.759
- Go out?
- Lou Daniels just called.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.856
- Nicole, it's Sunday.
- It's urgent.

05:33.933 --> 05:35.958
It sounds like a really special case.

05:36.035 --> 05:37.559
They always do.

05:37.637 --> 05:39.468
Save some pancakes for me, OK?

05:55.722 --> 05:57.189
Yeah, let's roll, man.

05:59.292 --> 06:02.557
<i>For some reason,
the more people I saw,</i>

06:02.628 --> 06:04.789
<i>the more alone I felt.</i>

06:08.668 --> 06:10.533
Yo, let's get some juice down here.

06:13.373 --> 06:16.865
'Sup? Everyone taking stupid pills
around here? Juice me.

06:36.829 --> 06:40.128
<i>Most of our time is spent trying
to lessen the pains of life.</i>

06:41.434 --> 06:43.868
<i>I was about to learn
how to quash hunger.</i>

07:08.828 --> 07:10.591
See something you like, punk?

07:10.663 --> 07:13.928
You're gonna see my fist
if you don't quit eyeballin' me.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.230
Kick his ass, man.

07:22.208 --> 07:25.541
Be cool, Skeeter.
He can't understand a word you say.

07:25.611 --> 07:27.772
He ain't dissin' you, man.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.438
All right.

07:30.483 --> 07:32.451
If he keeps starin' at me,

07:32.518 --> 07:34.679
then I have to kick his sorry ass.

07:34.787 --> 07:36.846
<i>I had no reason to fear this person.</i>

07:36.923 --> 07:39.483
<i>But he reminded me
of the snake in the woods</i>

07:39.592 --> 07:41.457
<i>just before it struck.</i>

08:09.021 --> 08:11.251
<i>I was glad
to see a familiar face,</i>

08:11.324 --> 08:13.815
<i>but a pressure below my waist
was bothering me.</i>

08:21.634 --> 08:23.397
Come on, show me what you got.

08:24.704 --> 08:26.672
Come on, put your hands up.
Put 'em up!

08:27.773 --> 08:30.401
You ain't tough, new kid.
Come on, put 'em up!

08:31.177 --> 08:32.303
Come on.

08:42.455 --> 08:44.980
<i>I wanted to learn his game,</i>

08:45.057 --> 08:47.821
<i>but the pain in my belly
was getting more intense.</i>

08:53.733 --> 08:55.098
Hey!

08:58.070 --> 09:00.800
<i>I barely noticed
the discomfort on my face</i>

09:00.873 --> 09:03.637
<i>because, inside me,
something had flipped</i>

09:03.743 --> 09:06.712
<i>and I began to feel wonderful.</i>

09:06.812 --> 09:10.475
Great job, guys.
No rec privileges for a week.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.518
Now get out of here.

09:12.585 --> 09:14.018
Now!

09:15.054 --> 09:17.147
Everybody out!

09:29.502 --> 09:32.198
Hey, Nicole.
Thanks for coming by to see him.

09:32.271 --> 09:33.829
Does "him" have a name?

09:33.940 --> 09:35.908
The paperwork says "John Doe"

09:35.975 --> 09:38.068
- for the time being.
- John Doe.

09:38.144 --> 09:41.375
What's a handsome boy like that
doing with a dead man's name?

09:41.447 --> 09:44.746
You know, he kind of reminds me
of my brother, Kyle.

09:44.817 --> 09:47.581
He got all the looks in the family.

09:47.653 --> 09:50.417
That's perfect. Kyle.

09:54.393 --> 09:55.519
Yeah.

09:55.595 --> 09:59.224
Can't speak a word, but damned
if he doesn't know what you're saying.

10:01.467 --> 10:04.368
- I'll be outside if you need me.
- Fine.

10:28.294 --> 10:32.321
<i>I wanted to show her where
I'd come from and what I'd seen.</i>

10:51.751 --> 10:55.084
So let me understand.
The boy has no family that you know of,

10:55.154 --> 10:57.987
he doesn't communicate
and was found wandering alone.

10:58.057 --> 10:59.888
That's all his folder said.

10:59.959 --> 11:02.826
No AMBER Alerts,
no missing person's report, nothing.

11:02.895 --> 11:05.989
But there is one more thing
you should see.

11:09.301 --> 11:10.859
No belly button.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.973
- They'll never go for this.
- Just a few days.

11:18.044 --> 11:20.535
- Finally. I'm starving.
- Did you get lo mein?

11:20.613 --> 11:23.104
Your mom's got something
to talk to you about.

11:23.182 --> 11:26.083
I have a new patient
and where he's staying isn't safe,

11:26.152 --> 11:28.586
so I'm bringing him here
for a little while.

11:28.654 --> 11:31.179
Some mental patient's
going to live in our house?

11:31.257 --> 11:34.693
He's not a mental patient.
He's a very sweet, very special boy.

11:34.760 --> 11:37.388
I know what "special" means.
He'll probably drool.

11:37.463 --> 11:41.422
I have to say I had thought, I'd hoped,
that you'd both show compassion.

11:41.500 --> 11:43.934
- You don't know him.
- He can't touch my things.

11:44.003 --> 11:45.061
That's enough.

11:45.137 --> 11:48.504
If your mom says he's coming,
he's coming, and that's final.

12:10.096 --> 12:11.859
This is it.

12:11.931 --> 12:13.296
Home.

12:15.201 --> 12:18.034
Where you'll be staying for a few days.

12:18.104 --> 12:20.368
At least until I can...

12:28.748 --> 12:32.707
<i>My first thought was that flat,
tiny people must be living in the walls.</i>

12:34.820 --> 12:36.879
<i>But then I understood.</i>

12:36.956 --> 12:39.390
<i>Humans grow smaller as they develop,</i>

12:39.458 --> 12:42.154
<i>and pretty soon I'd be shrinking myself.</i>

12:48.400 --> 12:51.858
<i>Maybe one day this woman
would hold me too.</i>

13:01.747 --> 13:06.184
<i>The images made my mind explode
with complex mathematical formula.</i>

13:07.153 --> 13:10.850
Would you like to play a game, Kyle?
Here.

13:10.923 --> 13:13.687
Lots of kids have tons of fun
with this one.

13:16.695 --> 13:20.358
This is called a mouse.
When you move it, this arrow...

13:24.670 --> 13:27.161
<i>Hello, there. I am a bird.</i>

13:27.239 --> 13:29.366
<i>I fly high into the sky.</i>

13:29.441 --> 13:31.671
<i>- Touch the sky and watch me fly.
- Hello.</i>

13:31.744 --> 13:35.111
- Did you bring him home?
- He's on the computer right now.

13:35.214 --> 13:37.910
Do you need me?
It could be a lot to handle.

13:37.983 --> 13:40.474
<i>- Honey, I'll be fine.
- Touch the house.</i>

13:40.553 --> 13:43.522
Getting a little old for Barney,
aren't we, Josh?

13:46.425 --> 13:50.384
<i>When I saw her, I realized
something was horribly wrong.</i>

13:50.496 --> 13:54.432
<i>Humans grow larger over time,
not smaller.</i>

13:54.500 --> 13:58.163
<i>It bothered me.
Wasn't I ever small?</i>

13:58.237 --> 14:01.536
Why didn't you tell me he was
in the house? He saw my boobs.

14:01.607 --> 14:03.541
What did she? Did he just?

14:03.609 --> 14:05.167
<i>I promise, we're fine.</i>

14:05.277 --> 14:08.178
<i>I've got another call. I've gotta go.</i>

14:08.247 --> 14:11.546
<i>...late-breaking news.
We'll go out to that right now.</i>

14:11.617 --> 14:16.077
<i>Our top story, a teenage girl
washed up on shore this morning,</i>

14:16.155 --> 14:19.454
<i>having no memory whatsoever
of how she got there.</i>

14:19.525 --> 14:23.393
<i>Fractions, fractions,
all done. Yum, yum.</i>

14:23.462 --> 14:26.795
How much blood? I'm on my way.

14:26.866 --> 14:30.427
Listen, there's an emergency at work.
I need you to watch Kyle.

14:30.536 --> 14:33.699
- Sure, Mom.
- I'm serious. Watch him.

14:33.806 --> 14:35.103
I'll be right back.

14:39.945 --> 14:42.914
Hello. Oh, hi, Hilary.

14:42.982 --> 14:44.609
No, Declan hasn't called.

14:44.683 --> 14:48.016
If he's with Jessica
he's probably got the clap by now.

14:48.087 --> 14:51.853
You know me. I felt weird when Mike Suby
put his hand down my pants.

14:53.192 --> 14:57.026
'Cause all I could think about
were these warts on his hand.

14:57.096 --> 15:00.259
That could be him.
If I don't click over you'll know why.

15:02.801 --> 15:04.462
Hello.

15:04.536 --> 15:06.094
Oh, hi, Declan.

15:06.171 --> 15:08.731
No, I wasn't talking to anyone.
What's up?

15:08.807 --> 15:12.334
I know!

15:20.419 --> 15:23.149
<i>It was the most beautiful
sound in the world.</i>

15:38.137 --> 15:41.971
<i>It was part mathematics
and part... euphoria.</i>

15:52.584 --> 15:56.315
<i>I felt certain that whatever this was
was a gift to the world,</i>

15:56.388 --> 15:59.551
<i>meant to fill all that heard it
with a flood of emotion.</i>

16:01.994 --> 16:04.121
Amanda, I'm home.

16:09.001 --> 16:13.062
<i>It then struck me that not everyone
could appreciate this miracle.</i>

16:13.138 --> 16:16.767
<i>The sound increased my sorrow
for those who could not hear it.</i>

16:35.160 --> 16:39.324
<i>There was a pounding in my chest,
my face felt like it was burning,</i>

16:39.398 --> 16:42.697
<i>and more than anything,
I wanted to disappear.</i>

17:15.434 --> 17:16.526
Oh!

17:17.803 --> 17:21.239
Run, Mom!
There's a psycho in the shower!

17:28.414 --> 17:30.848
It's OK, Josh. It's OK.

17:30.916 --> 17:34.408
This is Kyle,
the special boy I was telling you about.

17:34.486 --> 17:37.250
If he's so special,
why did you stick him in the bathtub?

17:38.424 --> 17:40.119
Nice to meet you, perv.

17:41.026 --> 17:45.190
The reason I am letting that slide
is because I have a favor to ask of you.

17:45.264 --> 17:48.927
I would like Kyle to bunk in your room
for a couple of nights.

17:49.001 --> 17:51.970
Are you kidding?
He's got bed-wetter written all over.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.766
Well, I'm only asking.

17:57.142 --> 17:59.906
Fine, but you better bust out
the rubber sheets.

18:00.646 --> 18:03.615
Have you seen Lori?
She was supposed to watch him.

18:03.715 --> 18:08.175
Some teacher called with test results.
Mrs. Planny-Parenthood.

18:08.253 --> 18:10.881
<i>I was beginning to sense
that my very presence</i>

18:10.956 --> 18:14.084
<i>was turning these people
against each other.</i>

18:17.429 --> 18:21.195
- You and I are gonna have a talk.
- Oh, no. Did something happen to Kyle?

18:21.266 --> 18:23.564
Besides him going outside by himself?

18:26.772 --> 18:29.036
You can forget about Declan's party.

18:42.387 --> 18:45.845
Mmm.

18:45.924 --> 18:47.289
Hi, honey.

18:47.392 --> 18:50.054
Is something wrong with Lori?
She seems upset.

18:50.129 --> 18:53.792
She's having a difficult time
understanding responsibility.

18:53.866 --> 18:55.766
Is this the, uh?

18:55.834 --> 18:58.200
Kyle, this is my husband, Stephen.

18:58.303 --> 19:01.966
- Honey, this is Kyle.
- Hello, Kyle.

19:04.943 --> 19:08.106
I'm happy to make your acquaintance.

19:09.815 --> 19:12.943
- Can he understand a single thing?
- I don't think so.

19:13.018 --> 19:15.509
At least he doesn't look dangerous.

19:16.488 --> 19:17.853
Watch it, watch it!

19:17.956 --> 19:20.823
It's hot. Hot. Ouch.

19:20.893 --> 19:23.919
<i>This being was clearly
a superior communicator.</i>

19:23.996 --> 19:26.556
<i>I somehow understood everything it said</i>

19:26.665 --> 19:29.998
<i>and wondered why others chose
to speak so ineffectively.</i>

19:36.708 --> 19:41.202
You know, this neighborhood
isn't zoned for halfway houses.

19:41.280 --> 19:43.544
- Good evening, by the way.
- Excuse me?

19:43.615 --> 19:46.345
One of your challenged cases
broke into my...

19:46.418 --> 19:47.783
He didn't break in, Mom.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.946
...broke into my house this afternoon

19:50.022 --> 19:53.150
and snuck up on Amanda
while she was alone.

19:53.225 --> 19:56.194
Who knows what could have happened
if I hadn't come home.

19:56.295 --> 19:58.525
I'm so sorry, Carol.

19:58.597 --> 20:01.498
Lori was responsible
for watching Kyle this afternoon.

20:01.567 --> 20:05.469
Nicole, I would hate to make this
into a police matter...

20:09.241 --> 20:11.505
Come along, Amanda.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.346
I'll see you later.

20:20.819 --> 20:22.980
It's not fair, Dad.
I was in the next room.

20:23.088 --> 20:26.057
I didn't leave him alone
with Michael Jackson.

20:26.158 --> 20:29.685
<i>There are over 800,000 words
in the English language.</i>

20:29.761 --> 20:33.322
<i>The eyes speak a more precise code
through their narrowing...</i>

20:33.432 --> 20:36.128
- We're not running a retard farm.
- Josh.

20:36.201 --> 20:38.362
<i>...brow arches, dilations,</i>

20:39.171 --> 20:43.335
<i>blinking or the asymmetrical closure
which I hadn't deciphered.</i>

20:43.442 --> 20:45.740
Don't you think this
is getting out of hand?

20:45.811 --> 20:50.373
Cool it. What did we say about giving
your mom latitude for a couple days?

20:50.482 --> 20:52.712
<i>I was suffering from thirst,</i>

20:52.784 --> 20:55.548
<i>but my language skills
were relatively primitive,</i>

20:55.621 --> 20:58.112
<i>so I relied on phrases I'd memorized.</i>

20:58.190 --> 21:01.318
Yo! Let's get some juice down here!

21:06.832 --> 21:10.131
'Sup? Everyone takin' stupid pills
around here?

21:10.202 --> 21:12.329
Juice me.

21:17.242 --> 21:20.609
<i>Oh, man, sweet.
He's like the Indian from Cuckoo's Nest.</i>

21:20.712 --> 21:23.078
Wait.
Did he just learn to talk in one day?

21:23.148 --> 21:25.412
No. Lori, that's impossible.

21:26.885 --> 21:29.445
- Right, honey?
- Can you understand me, Kyle?

21:29.521 --> 21:31.455
- Go on, do it again.
- Mom!

21:31.523 --> 21:34.890
Is that how you talk to a dog?
"Go on, do it again"?

21:34.960 --> 21:37.929
Watch this. Kyle, speak.

21:38.030 --> 21:40.965
I felt weird when Mike Suby
put his hand down my pants,

21:41.033 --> 21:44.469
'cause all I could think about
were these warts on his hand.

21:46.571 --> 21:48.505
Ha!

21:48.573 --> 21:50.063
It's amazing.

21:50.142 --> 21:54.078
Autism typically involves mimicry,
but Kyle isn't emotionally withdrawn.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.773
His behaviors aren't fixated.

21:55.847 --> 21:57.940
Can he understand us or not?

21:58.016 --> 22:02.146
I can't say. I've never dealt
with anyone like him before.

22:02.220 --> 22:04.984
Suby. Nice one!

22:06.625 --> 22:11.085
- I can't wait to test him.
- Why haven't the police found anything?

22:11.163 --> 22:14.724
- Somebody has to be missing this kid.
- So far no one's filed a report.

22:15.867 --> 22:17.994
The whole thing is really strange.

22:18.070 --> 22:21.005
Even stranger,
he doesn't have a belly button.

22:21.907 --> 22:23.772
No belly button.
I saw for myself.

22:23.842 --> 22:25.867
Kyle's stomach is totally smooth.

22:25.944 --> 22:28.708
- How could that be?
- He's extraordinary.

22:28.814 --> 22:31.647
Nicole, you said just a few days.

22:31.717 --> 22:34.277
Well, I'm not sending him back
to that facility.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.218
You are so wrapped up in this kid.

22:36.288 --> 22:38.813
- He can't stay here indefinitely.
- I know.

22:38.890 --> 22:42.121
Social Services promised to find
a safe spot for him by Monday.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.755
- Monday.
- Monday.

23:06.118 --> 23:07.983
Come on, boys, let's get to work.

23:20.832 --> 23:23.665
Whoa. Slow down, Rain Man.

23:23.735 --> 23:25.862
I haven't finished
grading the last one.

23:25.937 --> 23:27.905
You're kidding.
That was an hour test.

23:27.973 --> 23:30.305
How long did it take him, five minutes?

23:30.375 --> 23:32.809
Yeah. And he got them all right!

23:36.615 --> 23:38.583
What is this kid, seriously?

23:40.085 --> 23:41.848
Freaky, man.

23:43.922 --> 23:45.480
Hello. Dr. Fields, please.

23:49.194 --> 23:51.754
Try not to move, Kyle.

23:58.737 --> 24:01.399
Damn. When's the last time
you had this calibrated?

24:01.473 --> 24:04.408
- I go away for a week...
- I ran two MRls this morning.

24:04.476 --> 24:06.740
- You blind? Look, it's a mess.
- What is it?

24:06.812 --> 24:09.975
The equipment's on the fritz.
See this red area here?

24:10.081 --> 24:12.140
That's the active part of the brain.

24:12.217 --> 24:13.878
Yeah. So?

24:13.952 --> 24:17.285
You and I use maybe seven percent
of our brains at any given time.

24:17.355 --> 24:21.724
Einstein used nine percent of his brain.
Rupert here uses two percent.

24:21.827 --> 24:25.160
- It means he's a super-genius?
- It means mechanical failure.

24:25.230 --> 24:28.199
- Come back another time.
- What if the machine's right?

24:29.167 --> 24:32.933
Hypothetically speaking,
with this type of neural hyperactivity,

24:33.038 --> 24:37.600
he'd be prone to all sorts
of seizures, strokes, tumors.

24:37.676 --> 24:39.439
Tumors.

24:48.820 --> 24:51.789
Wow. It's been a busy day,
huh, kiddo?

24:53.458 --> 24:56.018
Good night, Kyle. Sweet dreams.

25:33.365 --> 25:36.994
Hey, dude.
You're not gonna wig out on me, right?

25:37.068 --> 25:39.628
I mean, if something weird
starts to happen,

25:39.704 --> 25:41.433
like you foam at the mouth,

25:42.374 --> 25:45.741
don't do it here.
Go get my mom.

25:52.083 --> 25:53.641
Damn, I miss Charlotte.

25:58.557 --> 26:02.323
<i>Charlotte's Miss Playpen, dude.
The magazine?</i>

26:02.427 --> 26:04.156
My mom hid her.

26:06.264 --> 26:07.526
Where?

26:09.134 --> 26:10.692
I don't know, my brother.

26:11.803 --> 26:13.566
I know not.

27:18.236 --> 27:20.170
Here. You're gonna need that.

27:20.805 --> 27:23.171
- What's wrong?
- First drink, then talk.

27:23.274 --> 27:25.435
Hi! Hi, Harry!

27:26.177 --> 27:27.838
Ooh.

27:38.957 --> 27:42.916
<i>An ancient ceremony was
underway involving spastic gyrations.</i>

27:42.994 --> 27:46.293
<i>The heat made me sweat
and I needed something to drink.</i>

27:46.364 --> 27:49.527
- Who's that?
- I don't know, but he's cute.

27:50.101 --> 27:51.568
So spill it already.

27:53.238 --> 27:56.002
I hope you weren't too set
on hooking up with Declan.

27:56.107 --> 27:58.371
Hey, beer bong!

27:59.878 --> 28:02.540
- Maybe I don't want to know after all.
- Yeah.

28:02.614 --> 28:04.878
Then I wouldn't go in there.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.449
Chug, chug, chug!

28:17.729 --> 28:19.492
Chug, chug, chug!

28:34.479 --> 28:38.813
<i>At the children's home, the other
captives referred to a strange place.</i>

28:39.884 --> 28:43.376
<i>I finally realized I'd arrived...
in hell.</i>

28:49.761 --> 28:50.819
Eww.

29:00.271 --> 29:03.638
<i>The appearance of an unknown enemy
had begun to agitate the group.</i>

29:03.708 --> 29:05.073
Party's over!

29:05.143 --> 29:07.168
Hold it right there.

29:07.245 --> 29:09.270
Nobody move!

29:15.587 --> 29:18.215
I dropped my phone.

29:22.127 --> 29:23.788
- Relax.
- I didn't do anything.

29:23.862 --> 29:25.989
Tell the judge that.

29:28.867 --> 29:31.097
- Whoa!
- What happened?

29:31.169 --> 29:33.262
Whoa, snap!
Did you see that?

29:33.338 --> 29:37.707
- Whoa. He's gonna cut himself.
- He just walked into a window!

29:41.112 --> 29:42.579
Get back here.

29:42.647 --> 29:44.205
Leave her alone!

29:44.315 --> 29:47.216
- Leave her alone.
- She didn't do anything!

29:47.786 --> 29:49.651
Cool it, kid. You're fried.

29:50.789 --> 29:53.451
<i>I remembered how the snake
had tried to frighten me.</i>

30:07.472 --> 30:09.804
Oh!

30:19.517 --> 30:22.975
Whoa!

30:46.244 --> 30:47.802
Oh.

30:50.815 --> 30:53.978
<i>I hoped this creature would have
as much sense as the snake.</i>

31:10.068 --> 31:13.094
Go home. Go home!

31:58.082 --> 32:01.643
I am... leaking.

32:02.787 --> 32:04.618
God. What happened to you?

32:10.495 --> 32:13.055
I don't know, Mom.
There's no blood on any doors,

32:13.131 --> 32:14.655
and the windows ain't broken.

32:14.732 --> 32:16.962
That's OK.
We'll figure it out tomorrow.

32:17.035 --> 32:20.801
<i>The images reminded me
I had no memory of ever being small.</i>

32:32.450 --> 32:33.974
What...

32:34.052 --> 32:35.485
...am I?

32:38.256 --> 32:39.746
Well, Kyle,

32:41.292 --> 32:44.386
that's a difficult question to answer.

32:45.730 --> 32:47.095
You're a boy.

32:47.999 --> 32:50.866
A special boy, and...

32:50.935 --> 32:53.699
...boys are human beings.

32:53.805 --> 32:55.966
<i>Even with years of historical research,</i>

32:56.074 --> 32:58.338
<i>the more humans try
to define themselves,</i>

32:58.409 --> 33:00.673
<i>the more they drown
in their own confusion.</i>

33:00.745 --> 33:02.770
...evolutionist point of view.

33:06.417 --> 33:09.682
You... know not.

33:25.103 --> 33:26.468
Now this one.

33:28.373 --> 33:30.136
It will help you detox.

33:30.208 --> 33:33.735
Forget it. One more sip and this place
becomes a barfatorium.

33:33.811 --> 33:35.472
Focus on something else.

33:36.614 --> 33:39.174
Like, say, your knight in shining armor.

33:40.184 --> 33:42.243
- What?
- Don't give me that.

33:42.920 --> 33:45.286
The guy who saved your ass last night.

33:47.158 --> 33:49.820
The guy with all the Jackie Chan moves.

33:51.496 --> 33:53.361
The guy who carried you home.

33:53.431 --> 33:55.956
Oh, my God.

33:56.034 --> 33:59.197
Kyle. I thought I dreamt that.

33:59.270 --> 34:01.738
So does your dream have digits?

34:01.806 --> 34:02.966
Yeah, mine.

34:04.042 --> 34:07.603
Remember that short-bus kid
I told you about?

34:15.652 --> 34:17.085
Hi, babe.

34:19.857 --> 34:23.224
<i>Apparently, not all forms
of greetings are appropriate.</i>

34:23.293 --> 34:24.920
You scared me.

34:27.465 --> 34:29.831
What is scared?

34:30.902 --> 34:32.335
Oh. Scared...

34:32.402 --> 34:34.768
...is fear.

34:36.007 --> 34:37.634
Like... Ahh!

34:41.279 --> 34:43.371
I get scared.

34:44.882 --> 34:47.908
What? What are you scared of?

35:09.574 --> 35:11.269
Everything.

35:15.780 --> 35:17.714
I don't know what...

35:19.617 --> 35:22.381
Kyle, I can't imagine

35:22.453 --> 35:25.422
how strange and scary

35:25.523 --> 35:27.582
the world must feel to you right now.

35:28.459 --> 35:30.427
But it will get better.

35:30.495 --> 35:31.985
I swear.

35:38.936 --> 35:40.494
Help me...

35:42.773 --> 35:44.263
...Mom.

35:57.221 --> 35:59.246
I'm gonna take care of you, Kyle.

36:01.659 --> 36:03.524
I promise.

36:05.663 --> 36:08.427
Hey. I can't believe I offered
to fix their computer.

36:08.533 --> 36:10.865
Their hard drive's fried
and photos are on it.

36:10.935 --> 36:13.199
I think Tim's mug scared it.

36:14.272 --> 36:16.832
- You'll figure it out. You always do.
- Yeah.

36:17.642 --> 36:19.200
- Stephen?
- Yeah?

36:20.344 --> 36:23.313
I can't do it.
I can't send Kyle away.

36:23.414 --> 36:26.110
- Nicole.
- Not the way he is now.

36:26.184 --> 36:27.947
We talked about this.
We agreed.

36:28.019 --> 36:29.680
He's just so vulnerable.

36:29.754 --> 36:34.020
And even the best facilities can't
give Kyle enough care and attention.

36:34.091 --> 36:36.059
Are you gonna
drop your other cases?

36:36.160 --> 36:38.185
You're already consumed by your work.

36:38.262 --> 36:40.423
Now you want to treat patients at home?

36:40.498 --> 36:43.990
Just this one.
There's something remarkable about him.

36:44.068 --> 36:46.628
I feel for the kid.
You know I do.

36:46.704 --> 36:49.605
But we have enough going on
with our own kids.

36:49.674 --> 36:52.700
- Our own family.
- Just until we figure out who he is,

36:52.777 --> 36:56.213
- and where he belongs.
- But we may never know.

36:56.280 --> 36:58.373
I know it's asking a lot.

36:58.449 --> 37:01.282
Yeah. Too much.

37:08.059 --> 37:09.424
Check with Lou Daniels.

37:09.493 --> 37:12.189
Maybe Social Services
has something good for him.

37:15.499 --> 37:17.364
I can't seem to find his file.

37:18.169 --> 37:20.660
I've got nothing for him, Nicole.
I'm sorry.

37:22.273 --> 37:23.740
Thank you, Lou.

37:49.267 --> 37:52.100
Come on, now. Where are you?

38:01.779 --> 38:03.440
Don't touch that.

38:03.514 --> 38:05.482
Those are for killing rats.

38:08.519 --> 38:11.079
Rats are your enemy.

38:11.188 --> 38:15.454
No, but when they start paying rent,
they can put down people traps.

38:17.461 --> 38:20.191
No, Kyle, we don't want them
in the house.

38:20.931 --> 38:23.900
So you kill them?

38:26.570 --> 38:27.867
Yeah.

38:29.106 --> 38:30.130
I guess.

38:35.646 --> 38:38.114
Ha! There it is!

38:38.649 --> 38:40.207
Man.

38:42.253 --> 38:45.086
Damn it!

38:53.798 --> 38:57.529
<i>Whereas verbal communication
was so random and contradictory,</i>

38:57.601 --> 39:01.230
<i>this language was a logical math-based
shorthand that made perfect...</i>

39:01.305 --> 39:04.172
Oh, come on.

39:24.128 --> 39:25.652
Wow. That's it.

39:25.730 --> 39:27.823
That's the one.

39:29.166 --> 39:30.656
How did you?

39:59.463 --> 40:00.589
You find this?

40:02.133 --> 40:05.569
- Why'd you do that?
- You said you missed her.

40:08.839 --> 40:10.500
Take a shot.

40:13.677 --> 40:14.939
Shoot some hoops?

40:16.814 --> 40:18.543
All right. Let me show you.

40:28.926 --> 40:30.393
Now you.

40:35.966 --> 40:37.490
Nice!

40:41.372 --> 40:42.498
Nice!

40:50.681 --> 40:52.376
OK. Kyle's gonna be down in a sec.

40:52.450 --> 40:54.782
Look, I have a favor to ask each of you.

40:54.852 --> 40:58.219
Before you all jump down my throat,
I'd like you to think about it.

41:00.324 --> 41:01.655
I was thinking...

41:01.725 --> 41:06.389
I was hoping that you wouldn't mind
if Kyle stayed with us a while longer.
