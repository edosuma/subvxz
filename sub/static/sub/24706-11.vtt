SlMONE: ''You'll find the other half of
this message if you find the other half. . .

00:07.333 --> 00:09.051
-. . .of this couple. ''
-Think it's Webster?

00:09.253 --> 00:11.403
The only similarity is words cut
out of Webster's 3rd Edition.

00:11.613 --> 00:13.126
Which is the guy's signature.

00:13.333 --> 00:14.766
Whoever it is. . .

00:14.973 --> 00:17.248
. . .l'll give you a million dollars
to kill him.

00:17.413 --> 00:19.973
They're planning an armored car job.
How's that?

00:20.133 --> 00:22.408
l have access
to military hardware.

00:22.613 --> 00:24.490
Did l tell you or did l tell you?

00:24.653 --> 00:27.213
-We need the bullet now.
SlPOWlCZ: Operation's a piece of cake.

00:27.413 --> 00:28.732
l had it on both cheeks.

00:28.933 --> 00:30.252

00:32.613 --> 00:35.923
Haverill sent Vinnie wired to me.
l sent him back.

00:36.133 --> 00:38.044
The cop who gave you the ticket
lD'd you.

00:38.213 --> 00:41.922
-Don't treat us like we're morons.
-You've been on this case 27 minutes.

00:42.133 --> 00:43.805
Raise your possibilities through me.

There's nothing
l can do for her?

No.

How's it going?

01:13.493 --> 01:16.610
So, what happened?
l wear those other guys out?

01:17.053 --> 01:18.486
l think you did.

01:19.493 --> 01:21.245
They out searching my apartment?

01:22.453 --> 01:25.445
You don't let very much get by you,
do you?

01:31.813 --> 01:33.929
Those lava lamps l have
are very valuable.

01:34.093 --> 01:37.449
-lf any get broken, you guys owe me.
-Fair enough.

01:46.693 --> 01:48.411
PUTNAM:
So. . .

01:49.013 --> 01:52.085
-. . .what's your routine?
-Me? l don't really have one.

01:52.253 --> 01:54.005
l just wanna get this thing done with.

01:54.173 --> 01:56.892
-l mean, you do too, right?
-Yeah, l do.

01:57.053 --> 01:59.806
Right now all we got you on
is taking that dead girl's car.

01:59.973 --> 02:03.170
Hey, l admit l was driving the car.

02:03.333 --> 02:05.608
l know l made a big mistake.

02:05.773 --> 02:07.764
lt was even illegal.

02:07.933 --> 02:10.163
l don't deserve this.

02:11.493 --> 02:16.886
Thing is, well, whoever did these killings,
he has us going from nothing.

02:17.613 --> 02:19.968
So l'm here because you guys
can't do a better job.

02:20.133 --> 02:23.921
Well, l'd like to argue that, but until we
find somebody else, you're all we got.

02:24.093 --> 02:25.924
This is a nightmare.

02:26.573 --> 02:28.609
Anyone you want me to talk to?

02:29.253 --> 02:30.891
PUTNAM:
Huh.

02:31.093 --> 02:33.653
You mean someone
who cares about me.

02:33.813 --> 02:37.123
-Well, maybe like family or something.
-No.

02:37.813 --> 02:39.849
No family.

02:41.893 --> 02:45.249
This room is as hot as my place
in the summer.

02:46.893 --> 02:49.487
l'll see if l can get the heat
turned down.

02:50.773 --> 02:54.004
Can l ask you something?
lt might seem like it's out of left field.

02:54.173 --> 02:56.084
-What?
-You admit you were in that car. . .

02:56.253 --> 02:58.483
. . .when you were joyriding around.

02:58.653 --> 03:01.645
Turns out this guy's last victim
was stashed in the trunk.

03:01.813 --> 03:04.771
-You say she was in the trunk?
-She was in the trunk.

03:04.933 --> 03:07.367
We found her in the trunk
after you abandoned the car.

03:07.853 --> 03:09.332
See where l'm going with this?

03:09.493 --> 03:13.566
You were in a car this guy
must've been in just before.

03:13.733 --> 03:16.247
The guy we're calling Webster,
the Dictionary Killer.

03:16.413 --> 03:20.452
You must've found the car with the keys
in it just after this guy had gotten out.

03:23.333 --> 03:25.688
That could be possible.

03:28.213 --> 03:30.010
You, uh. . . .

03:30.613 --> 03:34.447
You get any kind of vibe what this guy
might have been like?

03:34.653 --> 03:36.689
People are saying he must be crazy.

03:36.853 --> 03:40.892
You know, Jeffrey Dahmer,
John Wayne Gacy, one of these nuts.

03:41.053 --> 03:44.762
Whoever did this was not crazy.

03:45.973 --> 03:47.013
l mean,
l wouldn't think so either.

03:47.013 --> 03:48.082
l mean,
l wouldn't think so either.

03:48.253 --> 03:51.484
No. Not after he's had us chasing
our tails for the past five years.

[DOOR OPENS]

03:55.813 --> 03:58.486

03:59.093 --> 04:00.321
Detective?

04:08.213 --> 04:11.091
-What were you doing in there?
-You were out. We were talking.

04:11.253 --> 04:13.209
And l was making progress.

04:14.053 --> 04:17.170
l'm done with this crap.
lnspector, can l see you for a minute?

04:17.333 --> 04:20.370
lt's too bad you don't work a case
as good as you play the bosses.

04:20.533 --> 04:21.522
Anything in the guy's place?

04:21.692 --> 04:24.082
SOLOMON: No. l come back
and Simone's with him.

04:24.253 --> 04:28.087
Do l gotta nail the door closed on the
interview room when l go to the can?

04:28.253 --> 04:31.253
-Simone caught this homicide.
-l'm the lead investigator.

04:31.253 --> 04:31.730
-Simone caught this homicide.
-l'm the lead investigator.

04:31.893 --> 04:35.124
l'm working an interview sequence.
lnterference screws me up.

04:35.293 --> 04:37.363
This hydrant-pissing stops right now.

04:37.533 --> 04:40.127
Simone caught the case,
Solomon has the investigation.

04:40.293 --> 04:42.284
-Solomon runs the interview.
-Thank you.

04:42.453 --> 04:45.923
-Six known homicides in five years.
-You don't have to tell me.

04:46.093 --> 04:49.403
-l want a statement from this prick.
SOLOMON: Yes, sir.

04:52.973 --> 04:55.362
-He's losing the guy.
-You gotta let it play out.

04:55.533 --> 04:57.808
The guy doesn't lawyer-up,
because he wants to strut.

04:57.973 --> 05:02.649
-And all that asshole does is butt heads.
-Let it play out, Bobby.

Vishy Vashy Vinny

06:18.013 --> 06:20.891
All right. Heist goes tomorrow

-When everyone's here, Vinnie.
-No, no, no.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.684

gets in the squad.

06:27.853 --> 06:30.492
-What are you doing?
-Lieu, Haverill wants you on tape. . .

06:30.653 --> 06:33.770
. . .telling me to lie about the armored
car job. Telling me to say. . .

06:33.933 --> 06:37.608
. . .the Brighton Beach hoods are in on it.
He also wants me to ask you for money.

06:37.933 --> 06:40.925
-And you telling me you can get it.
-So you want him to think. . .

06:41.093 --> 06:43.323
-. . .that you're making a tape now?
-Correct.

06:44.173 --> 06:46.687
-Well, he just walked in.
-All right, all right.

06:46.853 --> 06:50.368
So you signed on to this story. You're
telling me to float the bogus Russkies.

06:50.533 --> 06:54.412
l'm asking you for money, you give
me a nod. Lieu, come on! Nod! Nod!

07:03.973 --> 07:06.009
Something going on

07:06.173 --> 07:08.209
Oh, yeah. They wanna do it.

07:08.373 --> 07:08.413
-They called?
-They want us to deliver the weapons.

07:08.413 --> 07:10.608
-They called?
-They want us to deliver the weapons.

07:10.773 --> 07:14.766
Call Major Perkins at the National Guard
Armory on Lexington. He'll bring it over.

07:14.933 --> 07:16.844
-We got the dummy ammo?
-We've requested it. . .

07:17.013 --> 07:18.685
. . .but check when they deliver.

07:18.893 --> 07:21.965
We'll have the commander
whack the ammo with a tire iron.

07:22.133 --> 07:24.124
Let's go, Vinnie.

07:24.333 --> 07:26.244
See you guys later.

07:28.413 --> 07:30.529
Any sense the hoods on this job
are hooked up?

07:30.733 --> 07:33.531
-Hooked up how?
-Like working for an organization.

07:33.733 --> 07:38.523
Vinnie's floating some stories. He's
talking about the Brighton Beach Mafia.

07:38.693 --> 07:40.684

-l don't know yet.

07:41.733 --> 07:44.042

Come on in, my desk is over here.

08:02.813 --> 08:06.442
You're younger than l pictured
when we talked on the phone.

08:06.613 --> 08:09.844
-Did you bring the note with you?
-Yes.

08:10.693 --> 08:12.012
LESNlAK:
Thanks.

08:12.293 --> 08:13.965
So tell me about the fire.

08:14.133 --> 08:17.808
Well, last night l was home alone
watching the late news. . .

08:17.973 --> 08:20.965
. . .and l smelled smoke, l thought
it was something in my kitchen.

08:21.133 --> 08:24.603
When l went to the living room, there
was smoke coming under my front door.

08:24.773 --> 08:26.047
What was actually burning?

08:26.413 --> 08:30.292
l opened the door, there was a little pile
of papers, a rag was on fire.

08:30.613 --> 08:32.888
l smelled lighter fluid on my door.

08:33.053 --> 08:37.365
A neighbor in the hall helped me put
it out, and when l went back inside. . .

08:37.533 --> 08:39.967
. . .this envelope was on the floor
with a note.

08:40.133 --> 08:44.251
''Leave 500 dollars in a paper bag

-l've tried to think.

08:50.853 --> 08:54.528
l try to be a nice person.
l'm not having problems with anybody.

08:56.213 --> 08:58.363
Do you think this is Webster?

08:58.533 --> 09:01.366
This really isn't Webster's m.o. Mn-mm.

09:01.533 --> 09:03.489
-l'm very scared.
-l understand.

09:03.653 --> 09:06.850
l'm not going home.
l'm staying with my sister.

09:07.053 --> 09:10.045
lf you want, that's fine.
l don't think you should be afraid.

09:10.213 --> 09:12.568
We know when and where
he expects the money. . .

09:12.733 --> 09:14.849
. . .and we'll be there
when he picks it up.

09:15.053 --> 09:18.728
Suppose you don't grab him?
Then he's gonna come after me for sure.

09:18.933 --> 09:21.606
lf he comes to pick up the money,
we're gonna get him.

09:21.813 --> 09:24.532
-Okay?
-Okay.

09:24.733 --> 09:26.325
Okay.

-l know about the tape, Vinnie.

09:39.973 --> 09:42.328
-Haverill's trying to screw the lieutenant.
-l see.

09:42.533 --> 09:43.966
Now, in that type of situation. . .

09:44.173 --> 09:47.333

ends, multiplying earning opportunities.

09:47.333 --> 09:47.685
. . .some might consider working both
ends, multiplying earning opportunities.

09:47.853 --> 09:49.366
You're not putting your hand out?

09:49.573 --> 09:51.848

if Fancy comes up short on this. . .

09:52.053 --> 09:54.692
. . .l'm gonna break all the bones
in your hands and feet.

09:54.893 --> 09:57.282
That kind of exaggeration
is out of proportion.

09:57.453 --> 09:59.921
-Like your hands and feet will be.
GRECO: l give you my word.

10:00.093 --> 10:03.449
The lieutenant's gonna be
absolutely fine on this. Absolutely okay.

10:03.613 --> 10:05.922
Detective, this is your hand receipt. . .

10:06.133 --> 10:10.763
. . .transferring one MK 1 9
grenade launcher to the N.Y.P.D.

10:10.933 --> 10:13.208
-Did you get those dummy rounds?
-They're real rounds.

10:13.373 --> 10:14.931
They've just been rendered inert.

10:15.093 --> 10:18.642
-Anybody gonna be able to spot that?
-They're a perfect match.

10:18.813 --> 10:22.283

this general liability waiver.

10:23.173 --> 10:27.007

what your plans are for the weapon?

Yeah, every year we like to rattle
their cage down at the ACLU.

10:30.853 --> 10:34.084
This year, we're gonna show up
and threaten to incinerate them.

10:34.613 --> 10:37.650
Liability waiver should cover that.

10:37.813 --> 10:40.805
-Let us know when to pick it up.
-Thanks.

10:41.133 --> 10:46.207

before or after the armored car?

-Her boyfriend gets it in the head.
-l don't know anything about that.

11:17.973 --> 11:19.531
Stop lying!

We checked your Social Security number,
you were working three blocks away.

11:23.893 --> 11:26.612
How about October 3, 1 989?
Where were you then?

11:26.773 --> 11:28.764
How am l supposed to know?

11:28.933 --> 11:30.889
-Where were you?
-Where was l?

11:31.613 --> 11:33.893
l was investigating
another double homicide.

11:33.893 --> 11:35.121
l was investigating
another double homicide.

11:35.333 --> 11:37.130
And guess what? You had a car. . .

11:37.333 --> 11:41.246
. . .registered at an address
two blocks away.

11:41.413 --> 11:45.486
How does Mr. Smarter-than-the-cops
feel now, huh? Not so smart.

11:46.533 --> 11:49.445
Well, you know what
you should feel like?

11:51.093 --> 11:54.290
You should feel like a scumbag. . .

11:54.493 --> 11:57.724
. . .who's going to prison
for the rest of his life.

11:58.053 --> 12:00.851

about any killings.

12:01.013 --> 12:03.163
l don't know about any letters.

12:03.333 --> 12:07.611
The only thing l know about Webster is,
he's that little black kid on TV.

You little prick!

12:10.853 --> 12:13.492

12:17.013 --> 12:21.325
You want to arrest me for joyriding
in that girl's car, go ahead.

12:21.893 --> 12:23.372
You got nothing else.

12:23.533 --> 12:25.489
SOLOMON:
You killed these people.

12:25.653 --> 12:30.090
And l'm here as long as it takes
for you to admit it.

12:30.373 --> 12:32.841
PUTNAM:
You got nothing else on me.

12:35.773 --> 12:37.729
Greg, you all right
to take a ride with me?

12:37.893 --> 12:39.884
-Where are we going?
-Screw Solomon.

12:40.413 --> 12:43.052
We're gonna take a look
at this guy's place.

12:44.973 --> 12:46.042
Asshole.

12:47.333 --> 12:49.244
Solomon showed up
at the funeral parlor.

12:49.733 --> 12:52.372
Detective, do you have a minute?

12:53.253 --> 12:55.767
-l'll meet you outside.
-Yeah.

12:55.933 --> 12:57.810
-How you doing, Benita?
-Good.

12:57.973 --> 13:00.203
l spell your name right this morning?

13:00.373 --> 13:01.852
Yeah, you got it right.

13:02.013 --> 13:05.403
Solomon's been in and out twice,
l thought they locked you upstairs.

13:05.573 --> 13:07.450
Locked out is where they got me.

13:08.453 --> 13:11.013
Do you wanna talk about it?

13:11.173 --> 13:12.731
l gotta go.

13:13.533 --> 13:16.093
Can l cash that rain check
tonight on dinner?

13:16.253 --> 13:18.892
Could be, l'll be in touch.

13:19.053 --> 13:20.771
l'm not going anywhere.

13:32.133 --> 13:34.522
-Hey, how's it going?
-You guys gotta take a look too?

13:34.693 --> 13:38.606
-Yeah, the bosses want another toss.
-The door's open.

13:43.173 --> 13:48.247
-So Aiello wants a second toss?
-Yeah, l think he'd want us to.

13:49.293 --> 13:52.126
-You guys need any help, just shout.
-Yeah.

13:56.053 --> 13:58.169
Greg, l need to take
a look around here. . .

13:58.333 --> 14:01.086
. . .and l don't want that cop
to come in, in case l'm wrong.

14:01.253 --> 14:04.325
-You got something in mind?
-There's something l wanna look at.

14:04.493 --> 14:07.132
-All right, let me go talk to this guy.
-Thanks.

14:17.253 --> 14:19.562
Boy, l hated fixed posts
when l was in the bag.

14:19.773 --> 14:21.047
Amen to that.

14:21.213 --> 14:25.092
Sitting around eight hours,
breathing stale air.

14:25.893 --> 14:30.284
-You got problems with your sinuses?
-Maybe they're clogging up a little.

14:30.653 --> 14:34.532
Places like this, there's molds
you can't even see.

14:34.693 --> 14:37.605
Little spores, you know,
that get in your lungs.

15:28.813 --> 15:31.008
-Greg?
MEDAVO Y: Yeah?

15:31.733 --> 15:33.291
You guys, come in here!

15:34.413 --> 15:35.687
Come on.

15:41.213 --> 15:43.408
SlMONE:
Make an entry in your logbook.

15:43.573 --> 15:45.962
l recovered this from
this guy's air conditioner.

15:46.173 --> 15:47.162
MEDAVO Y:
A zip gun, huh?

15:47.333 --> 15:49.893
SlMONE: Made to fire a .22 caliber.
Webster's caliber of choice.

15:50.613 --> 15:54.049
This guy in the interview kept talking
about how hot this place was.

15:54.213 --> 15:56.408
And l knew when Andy and l were down
in the alley. . .

15:56.613 --> 15:58.888
. . .l looked up
and saw the air conditioner there.

15:59.093 --> 16:01.732
So that's where he stashed the piece?

16:02.653 --> 16:04.291
That's why it wasn't working.

16:04.453 --> 16:07.411
-He pulled the guts out to stash.
-Good going, Bobby.

16:09.293 --> 16:11.363
-Appreciate it.
-Yeah, no problem.

16:11.533 --> 16:12.932
MEDAVO Y: You all set?
SlMONE: Yeah, l got it.

16:25.613 --> 16:28.332
Friend of mine's trying to get me
into this lronman stuff.

16:28.493 --> 16:29.767
-Here's a refill.
-Thanks.

16:30.013 --> 16:33.244
He swims, trail bikes
40, 50 miles every weekend.

16:33.413 --> 16:36.962
-He's got legs like steel pistons.
-l sent away for one of those treadmills.

16:37.133 --> 16:39.601
lt's been under my bed four months.

16:41.373 --> 16:44.683
Look, that mope's checking out the bag.

16:44.893 --> 16:47.043
This girl had no description of the guy?

16:47.373 --> 16:48.806
LESNlAK:
She didn't see him.

16:49.013 --> 16:52.767
Portable 1 to van, keep your eye
on the guy with the backpack.

16:52.933 --> 16:54.252

LESNlAK: Take him down.

17:04.373 --> 17:07.012
LESNlAK: Police! Hold it!
-Police! Hey!

17:07.252 --> 17:10.801
-Don't hurt me. Please, don't hurt me!
-No one is gonna hurt you.

17:10.973 --> 17:13.806
-Why am l being arrested?
-We'll talk about it at the station.

17:14.012 --> 17:17.483
ls there any reason l'm being arrested?
lf there is, l'd really like--

17:17.653 --> 17:19.211
OFFlCER 2: Here you go.
LESNlAK: Thanks.

17:27.012 --> 17:30.369
Simone found this in Putnam's
apartment during a follow-up search.

17:30.533 --> 17:33.252
-Found it where?
-Hidden in the air conditioner.

17:33.413 --> 17:35.847
-Does it match in ballistics?
SlMONE: 90 percent likelihood.

17:36.013 --> 17:39.483
This kind of weapon doesn't put grooves
on the slugs once it's fired.

17:39.693 --> 17:41.012
Webster's were all unmarked.

17:41.173 --> 17:44.609
Finding it in his apartment links him
to Webster homicides five years back.

17:44.813 --> 17:46.929
And the Battery Park
shooting last August.

17:47.093 --> 17:50.051
Let's get back to this follow-up search.

17:50.213 --> 17:52.602
You want Simone to put the gun back
so you can find it?

17:52.813 --> 17:54.565
Simone's earned a shot
at an interview.

17:54.733 --> 17:57.805
-l'm working a sequence with him.
-l think he deserves it.

18:00.133 --> 18:01.566
Maybe try a change of pace.

18:03.333 --> 18:06.609
-l wanna be in the room.
-You have a problem with that?

18:06.773 --> 18:09.128
-My interview.
-Yeah.

18:09.413 --> 18:12.132
-No, no problem.
-All right.

18:14.893 --> 18:16.485
Thanks, lieu.

18:18.973 --> 18:21.726
-How's your guy in a room?
-Better than your guy.

18:24.053 --> 18:25.771
Give me a minute, Archie, all right?

18:25.933 --> 18:28.401
-How you gonna work the guy?
SlMONE: l got some ideas.

18:32.293 --> 18:34.090
l'll be with you in a minute, okay?

18:34.293 --> 18:37.285
-You don't want me to go in?
-Nope, wait until l'm there.

18:40.333 --> 18:43.450
-What's going on?
-l found a piece at this guy's crib. . .

18:43.653 --> 18:45.689
-. . .so they put me in the interview.
-Good.

18:46.013 --> 18:49.164
-What's up with that armored car job?
-The clock should be running.

18:49.333 --> 18:51.403
They asked for the gun.
Greco made a stop. . .

18:51.573 --> 18:54.212
-. . .we're gonna take it out to them.
-Heads up with that guy, Andy.

18:54.373 --> 18:56.933
-Oh, yeah.
-Detectives.

How's it going, Mr. Marks?

19:02.093 --> 19:04.732
l'm just out of the hospital.
l just wanted to come by. . .

19:04.933 --> 19:08.130
-. . .and let you know that l'm in pain.
-Where they took out that bullet?

19:08.293 --> 19:10.488
ln my right buttock, yes.
On your recommendation.

19:10.653 --> 19:12.883
That bullet really helped
our investigation.

19:13.053 --> 19:17.012
Good. So l won't be walking around
like a crab for three months. . .

19:17.173 --> 19:20.768

it might give you some relief.

19:33.413 --> 19:35.085
Let's go, Vinnie.

19:37.653 --> 19:39.530
l was just curious. That's not a crime.

19:39.693 --> 19:43.049
-You weren't waiting to get the bag?
-No, l just saw it lying there.

19:43.213 --> 19:44.646
l wanted to see what was in it.

19:44.813 --> 19:47.281
-You didn't know it was money?
LESNlAK: What'd you think it was?

19:47.493 --> 19:50.405
A pastrami sandwich on dried-up bread
with a garlic pickle?

19:50.613 --> 19:53.923
-l was just curious.
MARTlNEZ: You know Maria Galvin?

19:54.293 --> 19:55.806
You think this is funny, huh?

19:56.013 --> 19:59.801
Let me put it this way, when we
bring her here, will she know you?

19:59.973 --> 20:03.329
-She might.
LESNlAK: Why? From where?

20:03.493 --> 20:05.768
l've seen her at work,
but l don't speak to her.

20:05.973 --> 20:08.407
-Why is that?
-We haven't had occasion.

20:08.613 --> 20:11.127
So instead of talking,
you tried to burn her door down.

20:11.333 --> 20:14.609
You left her a threatening note.
Was that your way of talking to her?

20:14.973 --> 20:17.123
Have you had problems
with a coworker before?

20:17.293 --> 20:18.851
Not that l recall.

20:19.053 --> 20:21.567
-Where'd you work before this?
-Several places.

20:22.773 --> 20:24.047
Write them down.

20:25.213 --> 20:29.252
All l did was pick up a bag.
You can't prove l did anything else.

20:35.413 --> 20:38.325
GRECO: You guys, get over here.
Get this thing out of the van.

20:38.853 --> 20:42.004

-Up your ass, Vinnie.

20:43.053 --> 20:45.169
TOMMY: Hey, come over here
and give me a hand.

20:47.293 --> 20:50.444
Maybe you don't need what l got.
What's with the other artillery?

20:51.573 --> 20:55.168
Here's the money we agreed on.
You pick the weapon up after 5 tonight.

20:55.333 --> 20:57.972
We talk about more money
if it's discharged?

20:58.173 --> 21:00.846
lf this thing isn't sitting
here waiting for you. . .

21:01.013 --> 21:02.685

21:02.853 --> 21:05.162

Cover-my-ass money.

21:05.333 --> 21:08.133
Screw you. Buy gun insurance.
Don't come crying to us.

21:08.133 --> 21:08.883
Screw you. Buy gun insurance.
Don't come crying to us.

21:09.053 --> 21:11.965
Whoa, that's unnecessary.
We've got an understanding here.

21:12.133 --> 21:14.886
-Where are we going with that, huh?
TOMMY: Put it up, Alex.

21:15.053 --> 21:18.648
Just by the nature of how things are,
you'll have to live with the deal.

21:18.813 --> 21:21.043
All right, look, he's got a point.

21:21.213 --> 21:22.965
Things go right, there's no harm done.

21:23.133 --> 21:26.170
They don't go right, it's nobody's fault.

-We assume certain risks.
-lt's my ass if this doesn't get back.

21:30.813 --> 21:36.046
Let's say we bring it back safe and
sound, and we leave an extra 1 000.

21:36.253 --> 21:38.164
And if not, not.

21:38.973 --> 21:40.247
Can you live with that?

21:42.213 --> 21:46.684
There's a mutual benefit there.
lf they succeed, we succeed.

21:46.853 --> 21:48.332
Well?

21:50.133 --> 21:52.886
Yeah, come on, let's get out of here.

Come on! Open the gate, let's go.

[GEORGE CHUCKLES]

23:08.173 --> 23:12.086
l was talking to George this morning,
his sense of what this guy might be like.

23:12.293 --> 23:17.048
-Like l'm some expert on Webster.
-George, you sat where the guy sat.

23:17.253 --> 23:20.848
You said that a few minutes after
he was in the car, you were in the car.

23:21.813 --> 23:25.169
Maybe you should be talking
to some kind of a psychic or something.

23:25.373 --> 23:29.002
Here's where we're hung up. Five years
back, there's a series of homicides. . .

23:29.213 --> 23:32.523
. . .all with a gun. The perp cuts words
out of Webster's Dictionary. . .

23:32.693 --> 23:35.685
. . .and puts them in notes
at the crime scene. Two days ago. . .

23:35.973 --> 23:38.646
. . .same kind of notes on two bodies.

23:38.853 --> 23:39.693
Plus, one of the notes claims
another DOA last August 1 7.

23:39.693 --> 23:42.082
Plus, one of the notes claims
another DOA last August 1 7.

23:42.773 --> 23:46.482
But here's the big difference:
The guy is not shooting now.

23:46.653 --> 23:49.611
See, these are all strangulations.

23:49.813 --> 23:53.692
Although the DOA last August 1 7,
there actually was a shooting.

23:54.933 --> 23:58.608
-l never read about the shooting.
-We just put that together now.

23:59.253 --> 24:02.245
l am giving you information
that no one else has.

24:02.413 --> 24:06.645
The woman was actually with a guy
when Webster approached them.

24:06.813 --> 24:09.088
The guy ran, and Webster
shot him in the rear.

24:09.253 --> 24:13.166
What a coward.
The guy who ran.

24:13.333 --> 24:15.767
Hey, he was scared of Webster.

24:15.933 --> 24:19.050
Webster's got this whole town terrified.

24:19.213 --> 24:23.923
What we're looking at with August 1 7,
that's a big change for this guy.

24:27.253 --> 24:30.131

-Exactly.

24:32.013 --> 24:34.129
Why did he stop shooting?

24:34.533 --> 24:37.445
l mean, did the woman provoke him
some way?

24:37.933 --> 24:39.571
What made him put his hands on her?

24:40.373 --> 24:41.772
Uh-huh.

24:46.653 --> 24:49.042
l wouldn't be able
to help you with that.

24:52.013 --> 24:54.652

24:54.813 --> 24:56.485

-Yeah.

-What we ought to do is kick his ass.
-No, we ought to get him a Coke.

25:33.013 --> 25:36.528
You lay one hand on this guy,
the ass that's kicked is yours.

-Where'd they get the machine gun?
-l have no idea.

And l don't want that.

36:17.693 --> 36:19.172
Yeah.

36:22.853 --> 36:26.163
That really wouldn't be fair.

36:30.733 --> 36:32.610
Think about it.

36:33.813 --> 36:36.281
He really is saving people.

36:37.413 --> 36:39.563
Why did he come back
to a new area of the city?

36:39.933 --> 36:45.166
The nexus of men
in need of his help shifted.

36:46.053 --> 36:48.567
One place was in need and then another.

36:49.253 --> 36:50.732
He goes where he's needed.

36:50.893 --> 36:53.487
Where did he disappear
those five years?

36:53.653 --> 36:56.372
Broward County, Florida,
would be my guess.

36:56.573 --> 36:59.610
-Was he active there?
-l wouldn't be surprised if he. . .

36:59.773 --> 37:02.731
-. . .did some interventions.
-But these were shootings, right?

37:04.613 --> 37:06.490
Why did he start strangling in August?

37:08.093 --> 37:10.926
Have you ever seen anyone strangled?

37:12.173 --> 37:15.882
l would guess it's much more gruesome
than being shot.

37:16.893 --> 37:21.364
You die looking your killer
in the eyes.

37:23.013 --> 37:27.609
That woman who got strangled,
what did she do to Webster?

37:28.893 --> 37:31.691
She kicked him in the testicles.

37:35.493 --> 37:37.802
You're gonna write this up
for us, George.

38:13.253 --> 38:14.732

38:15.093 --> 38:18.210
He admitted he sent the note
and he's waffling on starting the fire.

38:18.373 --> 38:20.250
Complainant can't testify on that part.

38:20.453 --> 38:23.570

for the arson, he may not do time.

-Yeah?

38:26.733 --> 38:29.201
You think he might go
the next step? Get violent?

38:29.413 --> 38:32.803
Yeah, l think he could.
l think he's trouble waiting to happen.

any zeros to it.

very short-term thinking.

Some of the detectives and patrol

in particular, Detectives Sipowicz. . .

41:10.453 --> 41:16.244

their courage, this operation went well.
