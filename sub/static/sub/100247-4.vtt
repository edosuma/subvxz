WEBVTT

00:04.809 --> 00:07.402
That's my mum and dad.
They used to meet at Izzy's to have sex.

00:07.403 --> 00:09.762
We had a pump from time
to time for old time's sake.

00:09.763 --> 00:12.122
Drew's a greedy wee bastard
who wouldn't let her

00:12.123 --> 00:13.322
out of his clutches.

00:13.323 --> 00:16.082
Marie went missing at a festival.
Three months later, she was dug up.

00:16.082 --> 00:18.082
Now I'm asking you to drop this.

00:18.083 --> 00:20.402
Marie got into a row with Jimmy
because she was drunk.

00:20.403 --> 00:23.882
This unknown here keeps cropping up.
I keep seeing the same peak.

00:23.883 --> 00:27.602
Sarah Gordon at SiFA flagged up
issues with the building.

00:27.603 --> 00:29.362
We're looking
at MacAfee Construction.

00:29.363 --> 00:32.241
Prosecuting the company
for corporate homicide.

00:32.243 --> 00:34.002
Be very careful about what you say.

00:34.003 --> 00:36.442
You're poking around in something
someone's wanting to hide.

00:36.443 --> 00:38.122
What if my mum was murdered
on that bed?

00:38.123 --> 00:39.602
Skye said she'd ask Izzy about it,

00:39.603 --> 00:42.770
next thing she's pulling
a knife on us.

00:42.803 --> 00:48.723
♪ Baby, you understand me now?

00:48.883 --> 00:53.643
♪ If sometimes you see
that I'm mad

00:55.443 --> 01:01.443
♪ Don'tcha know that no-one alive
can always be an angel?

01:02.003 --> 01:07.683
♪ When everything goes wrong,
you see some bad

01:07.843 --> 01:13.283
♪ Oh, I'm just a soul
whose intentions are good

01:14.923 --> 01:20.923
♪ Oh, Lord, please don't let me be
misunderstood. ♪

01:24.243 --> 01:27.322
When you look
at someone you don't know,

01:27.323 --> 01:32.402
you take in all their features
at once in a general kind of way.

01:32.403 --> 01:36.242
But then there's this other kind of
recognition,

01:36.243 --> 01:38.563
familiar recognition,

01:38.683 --> 01:42.802
where you know a face so well you
can see all of its irregularities.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.322
What you trying to say?

01:44.323 --> 01:47.602
So, you would recognise that person,
even if they were much fatter

01:47.603 --> 01:51.522
or thinner or grow a massive beard,
because you know that face.

01:51.523 --> 01:55.483
Well, I'm not going to grow
a massive beard.

01:55.603 --> 01:58.020
Or get much fatter or thinner

01:58.083 --> 02:01.583
and I don't have any irregularities,
right?

02:01.683 --> 02:05.683
So you can just think about that.

02:05.883 --> 02:09.026
I hope I did the right
thing telling DI McKinven.

02:09.027 --> 02:10.633
You did.

02:12.203 --> 02:14.882
Marie Monroe might have been
murdered on that bed.

02:14.883 --> 02:17.442
Did Emma say whereabouts she saw it?

02:17.443 --> 02:19.882
- In the box room.
- Well, let's get that headboard then.

02:19.883 --> 02:23.765
Right. And let's be primed to reopen
the case if needs be. Right.

02:23.766 --> 02:25.682
Keep it local. You hang onto it.

02:25.683 --> 02:27.533
I'll tell the review
team what you're up to.

02:27.534 --> 02:28.082
Thank you.

02:28.083 --> 02:31.322
Oh, and Neil, the major
investigation team has gone.

02:31.323 --> 02:34.073
- Where?
- Glasgow. Two shootings.

02:34.203 --> 02:36.953
They never said goodbye.

02:38.963 --> 02:41.322
I just found something
in the original files.

02:41.323 --> 02:43.962
When Jimmy first reported
Marie's missing,

02:43.963 --> 02:45.962
he said they had a slight
disagreement at the

02:45.963 --> 02:49.722
Tall Ships Festival, but Julie made
it sound a lot more serious.

02:49.723 --> 02:52.602
We'll ask him about that
when he comes in.

02:52.603 --> 02:56.353
Let's see what Izzy has
to say about that bed.

03:03.163 --> 03:05.002
How do I know you'll be back?

03:05.003 --> 03:09.837
Because I will. I'll explore
Scotland and I will come back.

03:16.523 --> 03:19.357
I have to come back to get my hat.

03:20.643 --> 03:22.683
OK. You may go.

03:39.683 --> 03:41.535
I've just had a call
from the police asking

03:41.536 --> 03:43.722
if we'll analyse the pills
that killed those girls.

03:43.723 --> 03:45.473
As part of the study?

03:45.523 --> 03:48.962
Well, they know there's a supply
of very toxic drugs in Dundee

03:48.963 --> 03:52.522
just now, and we have the means to
test them, so we'll see.

03:52.523 --> 03:54.123
Keep me posted.

03:55.443 --> 03:57.722
Right, what are we looking at?

03:57.723 --> 04:01.562
Emma's unknown crops up in 18 of
the 35 police seized drug samples

04:01.563 --> 04:04.443
we've analysed so far.

04:04.603 --> 04:10.083
And I think the unknown molecule
might be PMMA.

04:10.243 --> 04:12.122
Do you know what PMMA is?

04:12.123 --> 04:13.562
Louise was just telling me,

04:13.563 --> 04:17.002
it's similar to MDMA
but much stronger and more toxic.

04:17.003 --> 04:18.322
Aye, it can kill you.

04:18.322 --> 04:20.601
It can make your body overheat,
it can cause organ failures.

04:20.603 --> 04:21.687
Lethal stuff.

04:21.762 --> 04:25.322
OK, let's make up our own
standard of pure PMMA and see

04:25.323 --> 04:29.073
- if your molecule conforms with that.
- Cool.

04:30.523 --> 04:34.882
So, I heard from Neil there's been
some developments. Are you doing OK?

04:34.883 --> 04:37.882
Yeah. I mean, I was pretty spooked
by how much he set in motion after

04:37.883 --> 04:40.603
- I first spoke to him.
- Sure.

04:40.763 --> 04:44.442
But I rang him last night and I
think it was right to hand it over.

04:44.443 --> 04:48.602
Good. Are you getting all the
emotional support you need?

04:48.603 --> 04:50.683
What, here?

04:50.843 --> 04:56.843
No, sorry, I didn't mean
here so much as from friends?

04:57.163 --> 05:00.083
Yeah. Yeah, I am, definitely.

05:00.203 --> 05:01.483
Good.

05:02.963 --> 05:06.380
Don't be spooked by Neil.
He's a good man.

05:07.363 --> 05:11.362
We'd like your permission to retrieve
the headboard from your box room.

05:11.363 --> 05:13.763
It's not in my box room.

05:13.883 --> 05:15.362
We've reason to believe it is.

05:15.363 --> 05:17.802
I know what's in my box room,
thank you.

05:17.803 --> 05:21.522
Izzy, I can apply for a search
warrant, I will get one.

05:21.523 --> 05:24.362
It might take longer than you
agreeing for us to take it,

05:24.363 --> 05:26.082
but in the end
the result will be the same.

05:26.083 --> 05:29.003
- We will get it.
- I refuse. Why?

05:29.163 --> 05:32.830
Because it's got nothing to
do with anything.

05:33.723 --> 05:35.162
So what's the problem?

05:35.163 --> 05:40.443
That wee lassie, Emma,
who I cared for, who I trusted,

05:40.603 --> 05:43.722
has insinuated herself
back into my daughter and me's life

05:43.723 --> 05:46.682
because she means to make
a murderer out of me.

05:46.683 --> 05:49.242
It's not enough that I'm dying.

05:49.243 --> 05:51.162
I have to be a murderer as well.

05:51.163 --> 05:53.162
Oh, I can't deal with this.

05:53.163 --> 05:55.523
I can't deal with... Oh.

05:55.683 --> 05:58.482
There's
something up with my medication.

05:58.483 --> 06:04.003
The thing is, Izzy, we're looking
at an unsolved murder,

06:04.083 --> 06:06.483
18 years ago.

06:06.643 --> 06:09.522
Physical evidence is very hard
to get.

06:09.523 --> 06:12.963
And here is something
from that time.

06:13.083 --> 06:15.802
You were the last person to see
Marie alive.

06:15.803 --> 06:20.963
She was going home.
She texted me, "I'm going home."

06:21.123 --> 06:23.322
I know. I've seen your phone
records.

06:23.323 --> 06:25.242
She wasn't murdered on that bed.

06:25.243 --> 06:29.322
Then why are you so reluctant for us
to get a hold of it?

06:29.323 --> 06:32.363
We did loads of coke on that bed.

06:32.443 --> 06:34.243
Who's we?

06:34.323 --> 06:37.723
Me, Marie, Drew.

06:39.523 --> 06:42.691
- Is that what you're worried about?
- Aye.

06:42.692 --> 06:46.772
Izzy. There's no way I'm going to do
you 18 years after the fact for a five-two.

06:46.773 --> 06:49.842
- Are you serious?
- Trina. Back me up here.

06:49.843 --> 06:52.763
Possession of drugs? No way.

06:58.443 --> 07:00.523
Is Izzy faking it?

07:00.683 --> 07:03.603
Do you mean how bad
her illness really is?

07:03.604 --> 07:04.518
Aye.

07:04.603 --> 07:08.002
Well, she loves to tell us she's
dying, but she looks all right to me.

07:08.003 --> 07:10.002
Oh, I'll see what I can find out.

07:10.003 --> 07:12.503
Can you see her killing Marie?

07:13.243 --> 07:14.722
We don't know how Marie was killed.

07:14.723 --> 07:16.762
They never established
a cause of death.

07:16.763 --> 07:20.680
But, you know, it's not
so hard to kill someone.

07:22.443 --> 07:26.403
Dismembering and burying a body,
that's hard.

07:26.563 --> 07:28.442
Whoever did it had the wherewithal.

07:28.443 --> 07:32.962
You need privacy and you need
physical and mental strength.

07:32.963 --> 07:35.522
Or you need someone to help you.

07:35.523 --> 07:40.962
True. Then that would mean two people
who've kept a huge secret for 18 years.

07:40.963 --> 07:44.163
18 drug samples containing PMMA.

07:44.323 --> 07:47.573
And all those 18 drugs
samples are MDMA.

07:48.603 --> 07:53.722
Right, so PMMA has been added to
MDMA in the making of these pills.

07:53.723 --> 07:54.555
Why?

07:54.557 --> 07:57.602
To give 'em a better
buzz, so they sell more.

07:57.603 --> 08:02.602
This is my clandestine lab.
Production, the MDMA itself is made.

08:02.603 --> 08:05.963
Filtering, drying, mixing, pressing.

08:05.965 --> 08:08.045
Does this all happen in one place?

08:08.046 --> 08:09.147
They use separate places,

08:09.148 --> 08:11.522
so if they're raided,
they don't lose the whole lot.

08:11.523 --> 08:12.453
Smart.

08:12.455 --> 08:15.242
There are five different
recipes for making MDMA,

08:15.243 --> 08:18.682
so the key to understanding more
is to extract their impurities.

08:18.683 --> 08:22.002
That tells us the recipe, which
tells us the method of production.

08:22.003 --> 08:24.482
Which would help the police find
the people that made them.

08:24.483 --> 08:29.733
It would help them know the kind
of factory they're looking for.

08:33.482 --> 08:36.203
Handy surface for cocaine maybe.

08:37.443 --> 08:41.193
Give us a sneak preview
with the old UV, then.

08:44.843 --> 08:47.010
Well, that's a good start.

08:59.003 --> 09:01.602
Get the guys in the lab to swab
it for everything.

09:01.603 --> 09:04.722
Semen, obviously. Drugs. Blood.
See what they can find.

09:04.723 --> 09:08.807
And ask them very nicely
to be speedy.

09:12.323 --> 09:14.363
- Hello, Emma.
- Hiya.

09:14.523 --> 09:17.562
I was just wondering if you got
a hold of the bed from Izzy's?

09:17.563 --> 09:19.603
Yes.

09:19.763 --> 09:21.762
What tests will you do on it?

09:21.763 --> 09:25.180
You know I can't tell you that.
Bye, Emma.

09:28.483 --> 09:30.060
We should be set to do an GCMS

09:30.061 --> 09:32.842
run of these overnight
to extract their impurities.

09:32.843 --> 09:33.922
Bobby's ready.

09:33.923 --> 09:36.202
Can you trace a pill by the logo?

09:36.203 --> 09:40.042
No, because lots of different
factories use the same logos.

09:40.043 --> 09:42.682
Well, what if there's a flaw
on the thing that prints the logo,

09:42.683 --> 09:43.882
so there's a flaw on the logo?

09:43.883 --> 09:46.002
Can you trace a pill like that?

09:46.003 --> 09:49.842
That's ballistic profiling. Some
people set store by it, I don't.

09:49.843 --> 09:51.523
Why?

09:51.723 --> 09:53.802
I don't think it's
scientific enough.

09:53.803 --> 09:57.882
We need to dive inside the tablets
to see what we're dealing with.

09:57.883 --> 09:59.550
Appearances deceive.

10:00.523 --> 10:02.043
Look at this lot.

10:02.163 --> 10:06.242
They all look different, but
they all contain the same compounds.

10:06.243 --> 10:08.682
They all look like ecstasy tablets,

10:08.683 --> 10:11.402
but they all have PMMA mixed
in as well.

10:11.403 --> 10:14.070
That's why they're so dangerous.

10:15.323 --> 10:21.323
I know you don't want to talk to me,
but we have to meet up. It's urgent.

10:25.843 --> 10:29.242
Don't do any pills. There's some
really bad ones in Dundee just now.

10:29.243 --> 10:30.762
I'll do exactly what I want.

10:30.763 --> 10:33.242
Right?
I don't need any advice from you.

10:33.243 --> 10:35.410
I want us to stay friends.

10:38.243 --> 10:41.922
- The police came and took the bed.
- I know. I'm sorry.

10:41.923 --> 10:43.602
The whole street was out gawping.

10:43.603 --> 10:46.482
I didn't tell them
that you threatened me with a knife.

10:46.483 --> 10:49.162
Are you wanting a thank you now?

10:49.163 --> 10:52.562
I had to tell them about the bed
cos it might be evidence.

10:52.563 --> 10:54.363
My mum's my hero.

10:54.483 --> 10:56.403
I know her inside out.

10:56.603 --> 11:00.202
There's no way she had anything to
do with your mum's murder.

11:00.203 --> 11:04.362
No way. So how can we stay friends
when you think that she did?

11:04.363 --> 11:06.362
I'm trying to get to the facts.

11:06.363 --> 11:10.947
Skye, you and me are innocent
in this, we were children.

11:11.083 --> 11:14.443
- Please can we not fall out?
- Fuck off.

11:14.603 --> 11:16.437
I mean it, we're done.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.602
Thanks for taking me on as a client.

11:32.603 --> 11:35.882
Will the trial be in the same court
me and my dad appeared on petition?

11:35.883 --> 11:39.922
No, culpable homicide is
automatically High Court.

11:39.923 --> 11:41.722
What's the maximum sentence?

11:41.723 --> 11:43.838
Well, it's unlimited,
but I can't imagine

11:43.839 --> 11:46.202
you're looking at more
than five to ten years.

11:46.203 --> 11:49.323
- Jesus.
- If you're prosecuted.

11:49.523 --> 11:52.282
- If I am is it definitely jail?
- Almost certainly.

11:52.283 --> 11:53.962
But that's a long way off.

11:53.963 --> 11:56.722
And I'll be seeing the fiscal
in the morning and I'll remind him

11:56.723 --> 12:00.642
just how young you were
when that building work took place.

12:00.643 --> 12:03.122
- Will I tell you what I did?
- No, no, thank you.

12:03.123 --> 12:06.602
All I need to know is what
the Crown case is against you.

12:06.603 --> 12:09.082
And I'll do everything
I can to get you out of this.

12:09.083 --> 12:12.242
No, no, look.
I don't want to get out of this.

12:12.243 --> 12:14.962
I want to face my responsibilities.

12:14.963 --> 12:16.203
OK.

12:16.323 --> 12:19.043
Michelle was 19.

12:19.163 --> 12:21.323
Bashir was 22.

12:21.483 --> 12:24.602
She was saving to go to uni,
he was training to be a teacher.

12:24.603 --> 12:27.922
Now they're both dead
because of that fire.

12:27.923 --> 12:31.042
Those families are never,
ever going to get over it.

12:31.043 --> 12:32.283
OK.

12:32.403 --> 12:36.242
My dad, I mean,
he set this company up from nothing,

12:36.243 --> 12:38.160
and entrusted it to me.

12:38.163 --> 12:40.842
I don't want to drag him down,
I want to protect his reputation,

12:40.843 --> 12:43.962
so, no, I don't want
to get out of this.

12:43.963 --> 12:47.242
- You may change your mind.
- No, I won't. OK.

12:47.243 --> 12:49.602
I'll do everything I can to sort
this in a way

12:49.603 --> 12:52.187
that sits comfortably with you.

12:52.203 --> 12:54.442
We can take some
of the responsibility

12:54.443 --> 12:56.162
and limit some of the damage.

12:56.163 --> 12:57.762
Can't I just plead guilty now?

12:57.763 --> 12:59.682
The Crown'll most likely refuse

12:59.683 --> 13:02.850
until they know
what your dad is doing.

13:05.603 --> 13:08.402
- Can I contact the families?
- Absolutely not.

13:08.403 --> 13:11.002
And if they contact you,
stonewall them,

13:11.003 --> 13:14.242
because anything you say can be
passed along to the prosecution.

13:14.243 --> 13:17.403
And don't discuss this
with your dad.

13:17.603 --> 13:21.243
All you need to do is try
not to worry.

13:22.683 --> 13:26.522
Because if you're going to be
worrying about it,

13:26.523 --> 13:29.243
you'll be worrying a long time.

13:36.234 --> 13:38.393
Solicitor wouldn't let me
tell her what I did.

13:38.394 --> 13:40.593
She just wants to consider
the evidence.

13:40.594 --> 13:41.794
Right.

13:41.954 --> 13:43.953
We were booked to build
a bathroom next week.

13:43.954 --> 13:47.513
Guy rang this morning,
said he'd found another builder.

13:47.514 --> 13:50.513
Must have read it
in the paper that we were charged.

13:50.514 --> 13:52.954
- Did you see it?
- No.

13:54.914 --> 13:57.873
DI McKinven took the bed from
Izzy's.

13:57.874 --> 13:58.874
That's good.

14:01.914 --> 14:04.273
Listen, I found something out
a couple of days ago

14:04.274 --> 14:06.473
and I didn't tell you in case it
freaked you out,

14:06.474 --> 14:08.753
but it should do the opposite.

14:08.754 --> 14:12.460
Professor Gordon wrote the fire
report on Secrets nightclub.

14:12.461 --> 14:13.604
Your boss?

14:13.606 --> 14:15.433
Yeah. And she doesn't
care what people think.

14:15.434 --> 14:16.953
She only deals in facts,

14:16.954 --> 14:20.913
so I can guarantee that that report
will be balanced and factual.

14:20.914 --> 14:23.473
But from what you've said,
whatever you did or didn't do

14:23.474 --> 14:27.353
when you refurbished that building,
that's just one part of it.

14:27.354 --> 14:31.553
Honestly, you couldn't have a better
person write that report.

14:31.554 --> 14:34.154
- Have you seen it?
- No.

14:34.274 --> 14:39.108
Can't tell you anything about it
except that it'll be fair?

14:45.074 --> 14:47.793
Thanks for coming in at short
notice, Jimmy.

14:47.794 --> 14:49.913
There's something
we'd like you to clarify.

14:49.914 --> 14:55.831
When we spoke to Julie, she said you
and Marie argued at the Tall Ships.

14:56.154 --> 14:58.354
We did.

14:58.514 --> 15:02.113
In the statement you gave, when you
first reported Marie missing,

15:02.114 --> 15:03.873
you didn't state it as strongly.

15:03.874 --> 15:05.114
No.

15:05.234 --> 15:06.834
Why?

15:06.994 --> 15:10.153
I didn't want people thinking
we were brawling in the street.

15:10.154 --> 15:11.354
Right.

15:11.514 --> 15:15.273
If you're wondering was I trying to
protect myself from suspicion...

15:15.274 --> 15:16.954
...I probably was.

15:17.114 --> 15:21.274
But don't worry,
plenty of suspicion came my way.

15:21.354 --> 15:23.513
But why do you think that was?

15:23.514 --> 15:26.181
Because it's always the husband.

15:28.314 --> 15:30.981
Would you tell us about the row?

15:31.634 --> 15:33.968
We'd been building up to it.

15:36.594 --> 15:39.633
I didn't much want to go to
Tall Ships.

15:39.634 --> 15:42.034
I wanted to see the ships,

15:42.154 --> 15:43.714
but I...

15:43.874 --> 15:45.791
...I don't like crowds.

15:47.150 --> 15:49.269
Anyway, we got there and it was

15:49.270 --> 15:52.780
really full-on,
you know, sensory overload.

15:53.234 --> 15:55.318
Marie was in her element.

15:56.114 --> 15:58.031
We hooked up with Izzy.

15:59.354 --> 16:04.033
And after a couple of hours, I said
to Marie, "Come on, we've done this.

16:04.034 --> 16:06.701
"Kids are tired, let's go home."

16:07.394 --> 16:10.514
She said, "They can stay with me.

16:10.634 --> 16:12.793
"They haven't got school tomorrow.

16:12.794 --> 16:17.193
"This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing.
Lighten up, go home."

16:17.194 --> 16:21.233
I said I wasn't going to leave
the kids with a drunken mother.

16:21.234 --> 16:23.593
- Did the kids hear all this?
- No.

16:23.594 --> 16:25.113
Well, how drunk was Marie?

16:25.114 --> 16:27.313
Was she unsteady on her feet?

16:27.314 --> 16:30.594
No, she was just, you know...

16:33.074 --> 16:34.408
...disinhibited.

16:36.234 --> 16:37.434
Dancing.

16:38.674 --> 16:39.874
Singing.

16:43.914 --> 16:45.874
What are you thinking?

16:45.994 --> 16:47.661
She had a new dress.

16:48.834 --> 16:49.874
Pink.

16:52.034 --> 16:55.674
It was very becoming, the way it
fitted her.

16:57.914 --> 16:59.914
It showed off her shape.

17:02.234 --> 17:06.233
There was some pretty rough-looking
men in that crowd.

17:06.233 --> 17:11.901
Stripped to the waist, swigging from
the bottle, tongues hanging out.

17:13.634 --> 17:15.550
Watching Marie dancing.

17:17.753 --> 17:22.338
Kind of men who think
women are only good for one thing.

17:22.834 --> 17:24.594
Eyes were on her.

17:26.233 --> 17:29.234
That's what goes round in my head...

17:30.314 --> 17:32.481
...whose eyes were on her?

17:38.634 --> 17:39.994
Daniel MacAfee.

17:42.474 --> 17:45.273
My daughter's dead, thanks to you.

17:45.274 --> 17:48.834
Her son is dead, thanks to you.

17:49.874 --> 17:52.958
Have you anything to say
for yourself?

17:55.154 --> 17:58.988
I hope they lock you up
and throw away the key.

18:03.154 --> 18:07.393
Julie told us she heard a rumour
Drew smuggled drugs onto the rigs.

18:07.394 --> 18:08.054
Uh-huh.

18:08.056 --> 18:10.033
I spoke to the oil company,
the party line is that they've

18:10.034 --> 18:12.713
never had a problem with
drugs on the rigs.

18:12.714 --> 18:16.273
The unofficial story is that in the
'80s and '90s, they did.

18:16.274 --> 18:19.393
It was dealt with and there's never
been a problem since.

18:19.394 --> 18:21.561
Apart from a blip in 2002.

18:21.634 --> 18:24.833
A few workers were believed to
be in cahoots with security

18:24.834 --> 18:28.033
in smuggling in coke.
Nothing proven, five men left.

18:28.034 --> 18:30.193
Drew Cubbin was one of them.

18:30.194 --> 18:31.873
He's not worked on the rig since.

18:31.874 --> 18:33.633
- You got the names of the other four?
- Of course.

18:33.634 --> 18:35.393
And one of them caught my eye,

18:35.394 --> 18:37.034
Vincent Keir.

18:37.154 --> 18:38.793
Did an SID check on him.

18:38.794 --> 18:40.993
He was charged with a violent rape,

18:40.994 --> 18:44.513
but when it got to the High Court,
the verdict was not proven.

18:44.514 --> 18:46.435
Was he on the rigs when
Marie went missing?

18:46.436 --> 18:47.873
No, he was at Tall Ships.

18:47.874 --> 18:50.513
Well, let's get him in. And Drew.

18:50.514 --> 18:54.264
Maybe Drew and Vincent were in
on it together.

18:59.394 --> 19:02.593
Once you've scattered your items,
establish a base line

19:02.594 --> 19:05.273
by fixing your long measuring tape
into the ground.

19:05.274 --> 19:07.273
Let's call this Point A.

19:07.274 --> 19:10.834
This should be where zero
is on the tape.

19:10.954 --> 19:13.553
Run the tape through
the middle of the scattered evidence

19:13.554 --> 19:16.394
and fix it at the other end.

19:16.514 --> 19:18.848
The terminal end is Point B.

19:49.394 --> 19:51.514
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:53.194 --> 19:55.913
- What's this?
- It's a crime scene.

19:55.914 --> 19:57.594
Right.

19:57.714 --> 19:59.634
It's part of the MOOC.

19:59.794 --> 20:03.193
I'm sorry darling, it's just a bit
much coming home to a crime scene.

20:03.194 --> 20:07.154
Oh, my God, I, I didn't think,
I'm so sorry.

20:07.156 --> 20:09.471
It's quarter to,
I'm going to get changed.

20:09.472 --> 20:11.140
Are you going to get changed?

20:11.141 --> 20:15.141
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
- We're meeting my dad there.

20:16.314 --> 20:21.073
We picked you up for possession
of drugs on Sunday, the 12th of August 2001

20:21.074 --> 20:23.233
at the Tall Ships Festival.

20:23.234 --> 20:25.673
You were released for report
two hours later.

20:25.674 --> 20:28.314
Why the trip down memory lane?

20:28.434 --> 20:30.833
Can you remember where you went
next, Vincent?

20:30.834 --> 20:33.593
- Oh, aye, straight back to the festival.
- How come?

20:33.594 --> 20:36.073
Best party this town's ever seen.

20:36.074 --> 20:40.033
Ships coming up the Tay,
with sailors pouring off of 'em

20:40.034 --> 20:42.594
and drugs pouring off of 'em,

20:42.754 --> 20:45.274
and lassies pouring on 'em.

20:45.354 --> 20:47.188
Everyone was steaming.

20:47.234 --> 20:49.713
There was fights with the lassies
going off with the sailors,

20:49.714 --> 20:53.074
folk falling in the water.
It was wild.

20:53.194 --> 20:55.434
You'd have loved it.

20:55.594 --> 20:57.473
You worked with
Drew Cubbin on the rigs.

20:57.474 --> 20:58.953
Aye, we were roommates.

20:58.954 --> 21:04.073
You and Drew and three others were
suspected of smuggling drugs offshore.

21:04.074 --> 21:06.273
Now, just so you know,
nothing you say about that can be

21:06.274 --> 21:08.913
used against you cos you've not been
cautioned at common low.

21:08.914 --> 21:10.433
Not much to say, hen.

21:10.434 --> 21:13.033
You pile a load of men in the middle
of the sea with no drink

21:13.034 --> 21:16.868
and no women,
they will find a way to have fun.

21:16.994 --> 21:18.594
Nothing was proven.

21:18.794 --> 21:23.073
Nothing was proven. I really don't
know why we're talking about it.

21:23.074 --> 21:25.873
What did you do after
they let you go from the rig?

21:25.874 --> 21:27.833
I went travelling round Europe.

21:27.834 --> 21:31.154
- Any particular reason?
- No.

21:31.314 --> 21:35.193
You and Vincent Keir were roommates.
Did Vincent know Marie?

21:35.194 --> 21:37.993
No. I mean, he would have met her.

21:37.994 --> 21:39.913
Yeah, because you
and Vince were friends.

21:39.914 --> 21:42.554
We shared a room...

21:42.634 --> 21:43.954
...years ago.

21:43.956 --> 21:47.393
Did you know Vincent was at the
Tall Ships the day Marie went missing?

21:47.394 --> 21:49.794
No. Where's this going?

21:49.954 --> 21:52.433
What sort of a relationship did
you have with Vincent?

21:52.434 --> 21:55.113
- Volatile. Where is this going?
- Why was it volatile?

21:55.114 --> 21:57.993
Because that's the only
type of relationship Vincent can do.

21:57.994 --> 22:00.433
He's all bear hugs
until he loses his temper.

22:00.434 --> 22:02.351
Then things turn nasty.

22:03.994 --> 22:08.593
You know, you'd look OK if you
cracked a smile, wouldn't you?

22:08.594 --> 22:11.473
- Did you see Marie at Tall Ships?
- No.

22:11.474 --> 22:14.513
Now, she was a lassie
who knew how to smile.

22:14.514 --> 22:17.993
Awful what happened to her, God rest
her soul, but, no, I didn't see her.

22:17.994 --> 22:20.273
- Do you know Izzy Alessi?
- Izzy Alessi.

22:20.274 --> 22:22.713
Friend of Drew's, friend of Marie's.

22:22.714 --> 22:24.313
She was at Tall Ships too.

22:24.314 --> 22:25.833
Name maybe rings a bell, but no.

22:25.834 --> 22:28.153
Can you remember where you
were that evening?

22:28.154 --> 22:30.313
No. Did Drew know you were at Tall
Ships? What's going on?

22:30.314 --> 22:32.753
Am I in the frame for killing Marie,
is that what's going on here?

22:32.754 --> 22:35.754
Hey, stop writing in your book, pal.

22:35.994 --> 22:37.713
It's Drew you need to talk to.

22:37.714 --> 22:40.233
You need to ask him why he was
sniffing around Marie years

22:40.234 --> 22:41.913
after she was married to
another guy.

22:41.914 --> 22:44.233
You need to ask him why
he left Dundee as soon as he could,

22:44.234 --> 22:46.713
but not too soon as to look
suspicious.

22:46.714 --> 22:49.313
And if he sent you after me,
it's an act of desperation

22:49.314 --> 22:51.433
and if you two had
a brain between you, you'd see it.

22:51.434 --> 22:54.484
I said stop writing.
Are you listening to me, pal?

22:55.313 --> 22:57.730
- Daniel.
- You all right, Da?

22:57.753 --> 22:59.333
Good to see you.

22:59.911 --> 23:02.511
- Hello, Emma.
- Hello, Phil.

23:07.711 --> 23:10.545
- Drink?
- Aye, let's get a bottle.

23:15.591 --> 23:17.830
So what do you actually do all day?

23:17.831 --> 23:21.991
Well, I do exactly the same
thing over and over

23:22.111 --> 23:25.278
- so it doesn't sound very...
- Try me.

23:26.071 --> 23:28.991
I put samples into a GCMS,

23:29.151 --> 23:32.350
which is a machine used to separate
mixtures of chemicals.

23:32.351 --> 23:34.430
And what does GCMS stand for?

23:34.431 --> 23:36.501
Gas Chromatography
Mass Spectrometry?

23:36.502 --> 23:37.502
Oh.

23:40.471 --> 23:41.870
And how does that work?

23:41.871 --> 23:44.662
Imagine a long pipe
lined with treacle.

23:44.663 --> 23:45.663
OK.

23:45.711 --> 23:48.590
- That's the column inside the GCMS.
- Right.

23:48.591 --> 23:51.925
And imagine a load of balls
being sent down the pipe.

23:51.926 --> 23:53.070
OK?

23:53.071 --> 23:56.111
And the balls are the
molecules of different sizes.

23:56.112 --> 23:56.990
OK.

23:56.991 --> 24:02.230
The balls travel down the sticky
pipe and become separated by size.

24:02.231 --> 24:06.110
And what sticks first -
the big balls or the little balls?

24:06.111 --> 24:09.430
Come on, Emma, we're banking
on you for sanity here.

24:09.431 --> 24:12.431
The little balls stick the longest.

24:12.591 --> 24:14.950
The big balls come out first.

24:14.951 --> 24:17.285
I'm having that on my grave.

24:19.071 --> 24:21.190
It's a pretty incredible machine.

24:21.191 --> 24:22.790
Tell him what you're analysing.

24:22.791 --> 24:25.991
Street drugs. Seized by the police.

24:26.071 --> 24:27.071
Fascinating.

24:28.231 --> 24:31.981
And what's your line
on drugs, do you partake?

24:35.511 --> 24:40.111
You certain have done
and probably still do. Exactly.

24:40.231 --> 24:42.110
This is an interesting
angle for Emma to have,

24:42.111 --> 24:45.991
you know, the science of it.

24:46.151 --> 24:48.790
Sorry, Emma,
don't feel you have to tell me.

24:48.791 --> 24:50.271
No, no, I will.

24:51.991 --> 24:55.911
Well, it's
definitely made me more aware.

24:56.031 --> 24:57.271
Yeah.

24:59.191 --> 25:01.230
Definitely made you more aware.

25:01.231 --> 25:04.631
So, where in England are you from?

25:04.751 --> 25:06.430
I'm actually from Dundee.

25:06.431 --> 25:07.431
Are you?

25:07.511 --> 25:10.511
- Moved away when I was seven.
- Why?

25:11.911 --> 25:14.311
It's OK.

25:14.431 --> 25:16.191
I lost my mum.

25:19.071 --> 25:22.350
- Hell of a thing she went through.
- Still going through.

25:22.351 --> 25:24.550
Coming back to Dundee's thrown
a lot of stuff up,

25:24.551 --> 25:26.430
stuff she's just finding out.

25:26.431 --> 25:28.190
They never convicted anyone.

25:28.191 --> 25:31.858
- What was her mother's name?
- Marie Monroe.

25:32.231 --> 25:33.590
How did you two meet?

25:33.591 --> 25:35.341
I met her at Paradox.

25:35.391 --> 25:38.230
Eyes across the dance floor.

25:38.231 --> 25:41.430
It was nine o'clock in the morning.
She left her bag behind.

25:41.431 --> 25:46.098
What were you doing there
at nine o'clock in the morning?

25:46.511 --> 25:48.070
I went to check the work we'd done.

25:48.071 --> 25:50.270
See if there were issues similar to
the Secrets refurb that

25:50.271 --> 25:53.271
needed sorting out, which I've done.

25:56.311 --> 25:59.830
Dad. I'm so sorry.
I've really let you down.

25:59.831 --> 26:03.031
Hey. We agreed. No work tonight.

26:03.151 --> 26:06.950
So what, you saw this damsel in
distress looking about for her bag?

26:06.951 --> 26:10.230
Nah, she was outside. She come up
and ask me for help her get in.

26:10.231 --> 26:13.065
There's a fish tank in the ladies.

27:00.751 --> 27:01.751
Fuck.

27:03.391 --> 27:06.071
Daniel?

27:06.151 --> 27:08.031
Daniel.

27:08.191 --> 27:10.391
What is it?

27:10.471 --> 27:11.751
Nothing.

27:13.591 --> 27:15.008
What do you want?

27:16.431 --> 27:17.831
Company.

27:19.951 --> 27:22.671
Come here. Come here.

27:22.751 --> 27:24.111
I'm here.

27:25.231 --> 27:26.671
I'm all yours.

27:28.031 --> 27:29.591
I love you.

27:29.751 --> 27:31.835
I love you too.

28:27.511 --> 28:30.111
I dreamt I dug you up.

28:31.591 --> 28:33.391
You keep visiting me.

28:39.111 --> 28:41.361
I am fighting for you, Mum.

28:43.591 --> 28:45.351
I am.

28:48.071 --> 28:49.383
Emma rang me yesterday,

28:49.384 --> 28:52.230
asking if I'd found a
certain piece of evidence.

28:52.231 --> 28:54.481
And we had it in our hands.

28:56.031 --> 28:58.630
She's determined. And impulsive.

28:58.631 --> 29:00.630
Yeah, well,
it could get her into trouble.

29:00.631 --> 29:02.750
That's why we need to look
out for her.

29:02.751 --> 29:05.168
We can be her secret parents.

29:06.591 --> 29:09.110
- Where's her swimming kit?
- She left it on the bus.

29:09.111 --> 29:11.950
- Can you come to parents' night?
- Mm, no.

29:11.951 --> 29:14.868
- Where we going on holiday?
- Rome.

29:17.151 --> 29:19.790
Anyway, sounds like you're making
progress with Marie Monroe.

29:19.791 --> 29:20.951
Well...

29:22.111 --> 29:26.110
...I just want to find out the truth,
same as Emma.

29:26.111 --> 29:28.601
I went to see the fiscal this morning.

29:28.602 --> 29:29.430
Right?

29:29.431 --> 29:33.670
Your father's solicitor saw him
yesterday, he got there first.

29:33.671 --> 29:34.910
Is that a problem?

29:34.911 --> 29:37.750
Well, it can be
a bit of your game of poker.

29:37.751 --> 29:38.621
How do you mean?

29:38.623 --> 29:41.230
You said you wanted
to protect your father.

29:41.231 --> 29:43.510
You didn't want to drag him down.

29:43.511 --> 29:47.830
That's right. Daniel, your dad
doesn't want to plead guilty to anything,

29:47.831 --> 29:51.390
even though he was the company
director at the point of investigation.

29:51.391 --> 29:54.470
He wants his name
left off the indictment.

29:54.471 --> 29:57.270
Well, he must have his reasons
for wanting to do that.

29:57.271 --> 30:00.510
Oh, he does.
He's putting the blame on you.

30:00.511 --> 30:02.270
He's not out to protect you.

30:02.271 --> 30:04.510
- He's trying his luck.
- Hey.

30:04.511 --> 30:07.390
You don't know him and you're
pitting us against each other.

30:07.391 --> 30:09.070
We need to change our strategy.

30:09.071 --> 30:11.511
You were naive and inept,

30:11.671 --> 30:14.310
but you shouldn't be prosecuted
for culp hom.

30:14.311 --> 30:17.750
One thing we can try and do is
keep your name off the indictment.

30:17.751 --> 30:18.781
How?

30:18.783 --> 30:22.030
If you give evidence
against your father.

30:22.031 --> 30:26.510
- No way.
- I know it's hard. It's not hard. It's insane.

30:26.511 --> 30:30.270
You're standing there telling me
my dad's fitting me up.

30:30.271 --> 30:32.688
He's looking out for himself.

30:32.791 --> 30:34.511
No-one else.

30:34.671 --> 30:36.511
Not even you.

30:37.005 --> 30:40.331
She's suggesting you're washing your
hands of the whole Secrets thing

30:40.332 --> 30:43.964
and, well, screwing me over,
basically, and I just want to come and...

30:43.965 --> 30:46.684
- Ask me if I'm screwing you over?
- No. No, I just want to.

30:46.685 --> 30:47.685
Ask me.

30:50.565 --> 30:53.982
- Dad, are you screwing me over?
- Uh, no.

30:54.045 --> 30:56.004
Did you push to get your name
left off the indictment?

30:56.005 --> 30:58.125
Yes. And so, should you?

30:59.405 --> 31:02.284
- What's your solicitor called again?
- Clare.

31:02.285 --> 31:04.444
Clare should be telling you
the same thing.

31:04.445 --> 31:06.564
It's fine having these noble
feelings,

31:06.565 --> 31:08.364
but the Court's a different place.

31:08.365 --> 31:10.282
It's not about justice.

31:10.405 --> 31:12.644
It's about making sure
someone takes the blame.

31:12.645 --> 31:14.124
If you're the guy who says,

31:14.125 --> 31:16.644
"These two deaths are something to
do with me,"

31:16.645 --> 31:18.844
it'll be everything to do with you.

31:18.845 --> 31:20.564
They are something to do with me.

31:20.565 --> 31:23.644
Shuggie Brock is to blame for this,
and he's dead.

31:23.645 --> 31:26.564
That's why they're coming after us.
We're the scapegoats.

31:26.565 --> 31:28.844
- We did nothing wrong.
- Come on, Dad, we...

31:28.845 --> 31:32.285
Did we kill Ian?
Did we start a fire?

31:32.445 --> 31:35.844
Did we lock two people in a room
next to the fire?

31:35.845 --> 31:36.645
No.

31:36.647 --> 31:39.044
No, knew Shuggie Brock
knew he was to blame

31:39.045 --> 31:40.324
and he jumped off a bridge.

31:40.325 --> 31:42.992
That's justice done right there.

31:43.565 --> 31:44.804
That's how you see it?

31:44.805 --> 31:46.965
That's how it is.

31:47.125 --> 31:52.004
OK, well, I can't say I did nothing,
and I want to make amends.

31:52.005 --> 31:54.365
You'll be eaten alive.

31:54.525 --> 31:57.404
Making amends is saying you
were wrong.

31:57.405 --> 31:59.805
We're tied in this together.

31:59.925 --> 32:02.444
If you were wrong, I was wrong.

32:02.445 --> 32:07.604
You feel bad about the families, I
get it, but you've got a family too.

32:07.605 --> 32:09.604
I don't want to go to jail, son.

32:09.605 --> 32:12.644
- I don't want you to go to jail.
- Do you want to go to jail?

32:12.645 --> 32:14.005
No.

32:15.485 --> 32:18.735
Then stop nailing
yourself to the cross.

32:19.725 --> 32:21.085
Come here.

32:23.805 --> 32:28.305
- I love you.
- I love you too, Da. I've got your back.

32:30.325 --> 32:33.484
For the purposes of the Court,
we did nothing wrong, both of us.

32:33.485 --> 32:36.605
- No grey areas, OK?
- OK.

32:41.485 --> 32:43.090
Uh-huh, on Izzy's bedside tables

32:43.091 --> 32:45.644
the lab found traces of
coke, speed and cannabis.

32:45.645 --> 32:46.705
Right.

32:46.707 --> 32:49.884
The semen on the headboard
belongs to five different men.

32:49.885 --> 32:51.644
One of them repeatedly.

32:51.645 --> 32:54.284
But there's a DNA match
for just one of them.

32:54.285 --> 32:59.285
And it's the guy we already knew
slept with Marie in her bed.

33:00.245 --> 33:01.605
- Drew.
- Aye.

33:03.485 --> 33:05.235
Not a trace of blood.

33:07.925 --> 33:09.106
What have you got?

33:09.107 --> 33:12.644
Still trying to dig up
stuff on Vincent and Drew.

33:12.645 --> 33:14.284
I spoke to Izzy's doctor.

33:14.285 --> 33:16.764
She's as ill as she says she is.

33:16.765 --> 33:18.925
It's chronic bronchitis.

33:19.085 --> 33:23.004
You get exacerbations, flare ups,
which damage your lungs.

33:23.005 --> 33:25.964
It's progressive and hers
is progressing fast,

33:25.965 --> 33:28.632
and that's all I've got for now.

33:30.845 --> 33:32.572
No, the biggest pain in the arse

33:32.573 --> 33:35.644
is that they didn't find
Marie's body for three months.

33:35.645 --> 33:38.684
Could have been kept
somewhere before it was dumped?

33:38.685 --> 33:42.185
Her murderer had
a load of time to tidy up.

33:45.525 --> 33:48.364
- Oh, I love this.
- We went old-school.

33:48.365 --> 33:51.884
This shows all the impurities
associated with all five recipes.

33:51.885 --> 33:53.804
And that's all of our 18 samples

33:53.805 --> 33:55.724
and whatever impurities
showed up in them.

33:55.725 --> 34:01.685
And each acetate shows one
distinct impurity family.

34:01.765 --> 34:04.965
So, no good. Same with three others.

34:05.085 --> 34:06.845
This one...

34:10.125 --> 34:12.123
That's your family of impurities.

34:12.125 --> 34:13.484
What's the recipe?

34:13.485 --> 34:16.364
According to the database, it's the
recipe used for the cold production.

34:16.364 --> 34:18.485
- Oh, that's great.
- Why?

34:18.645 --> 34:20.804
Well, I've only ever seen drugs
coming out of Europe made

34:20.804 --> 34:23.964
that way and it changes what the
police are looking for.

34:23.965 --> 34:27.643
Cold production uses freezers,
there's very little smell

34:27.645 --> 34:29.563
so a factory could easily go
undetected.

34:29.565 --> 34:31.404
The police aren't
looking for freezers,

34:31.405 --> 34:33.324
so this is really important
information.

34:33.324 --> 34:34.844
I can't wait to tell them.

34:34.844 --> 34:37.594
This is very exciting, well done.

34:40.125 --> 34:42.125
- Clare.
- Oh, hello.

34:47.804 --> 34:49.884
Oh, that's quite a turn around.

34:49.885 --> 34:52.603
Fine. We'll fight it all the way.

34:52.605 --> 34:55.324
- Fine. I, I thought you might be...
- Ah.

34:55.324 --> 34:58.564
You want to keep your liberty.
That's normal.

34:58.565 --> 35:01.324
- I take it you've spoken to your da?
- Aye.

35:01.325 --> 35:03.885
And I'm really glad I did.

35:04.005 --> 35:06.755
OK. Oh, and she's been spoken to.

35:06.805 --> 35:10.004
Whoa, whoa,
I didn't want her spoken to.

35:10.005 --> 35:13.324
- I just thought I should tell you.
- You did right to tell me, Daniel.

35:13.325 --> 35:18.004
We need to keep things civilised.
She'll not be accosting you again.

35:18.005 --> 35:19.445
I'll be in touch.

35:39.285 --> 35:41.804
I want to ask you something.
You do the MOOC right?

35:41.805 --> 35:44.804
- Yes.
- Is your user name Emma Bunny?

35:44.805 --> 35:47.284
- Yeah.
- Thought that, was you?

35:47.285 --> 35:49.785
You ask really good questions.

35:49.925 --> 35:51.365
Thank you.

35:51.525 --> 35:54.044
I love the MOOC. I had a crime scene
all over the floor last night.

35:54.045 --> 35:55.725
That's great. Nice.

36:06.365 --> 36:08.804
I genuinely didn't expect
to see you.

36:08.805 --> 36:12.604
I was just near the campus
and curious to see where you work.

36:12.605 --> 36:15.484
- Can I give you a life somewhere?
- No, I'm all right, thanks.

36:15.485 --> 36:19.085
Jump in a minute, I'd like a word.

36:19.205 --> 36:20.845
Jump in.

36:28.005 --> 36:30.244
Have you seen your father lately?

36:30.245 --> 36:31.445
No.

36:33.085 --> 36:38.244
I wonder what other secrets he's
been hiding from us about Marie.

36:38.245 --> 36:40.995
You've been cavalier with people.

36:42.565 --> 36:45.232
You're causing a lot of trouble.

36:47.365 --> 36:49.782
And I take my hat off to you.

36:50.645 --> 36:51.725
I do.

36:54.885 --> 36:57.644
The man who killed Marie is
still out there.

36:57.645 --> 36:59.729
I want to know who he is.

37:01.845 --> 37:04.429
And I want him to pay for it...

37:04.885 --> 37:06.635
...as much as you do.

37:09.405 --> 37:13.364
So if I can help in any way with
what you're doing,

37:13.365 --> 37:15.205
you let me know.

37:19.965 --> 37:22.205
Don't give up.

37:22.325 --> 37:24.245
Don't worry, I won't.

37:39.645 --> 37:41.125
Nice hat.

37:45.037 --> 37:47.680
- Thanks.
- Never seen you wear a hat.

37:47.681 --> 37:48.681
Well.

37:50.085 --> 37:55.445
Emma seems fine to me, I, we
had a talk and she was chipper.

37:55.645 --> 37:58.444
Yeah. I just worry I'm not giving
her as much support as she'd like.

37:58.445 --> 38:00.844
Just be her boss,
that's all you have to do.

38:00.845 --> 38:03.084
She's totally over her mother's
murder being in the MOOC,

38:03.085 --> 38:05.124
so you should forget about it too.

38:05.125 --> 38:07.204
Her mother's murder
wasn't in the MOOC.

38:07.205 --> 38:09.045
OK. It almost was.

38:11.565 --> 38:14.364
Janine, you didn't hear any of this,
right?

38:14.365 --> 38:16.045
Any of what?

38:34.405 --> 38:38.404
The rule of the soil site is just to
take ecological samples

38:38.405 --> 38:41.284
to characterise the immediate
and surrounding environment.

38:41.285 --> 38:42.725
Hi.

38:48.845 --> 38:52.165
Hello. You gave me a fright.

38:52.285 --> 38:54.285
I thought no-one was in.

38:54.365 --> 38:57.244
I'm sorry, darling, I didn't see
Daniel's car parked outside,

38:57.245 --> 38:59.485
so I assumed no-one was in.
I'm so sorry.

38:59.486 --> 39:00.764
No, you're fine.

39:00.765 --> 39:03.324
I just came to drop
this off for him.

39:03.325 --> 39:05.725
Primitivo and Bardolino.

39:05.845 --> 39:10.679
He loves his Italian red
and he needs a bit of cheering up.

39:14.365 --> 39:16.699
I didn't know you had a key.

39:16.765 --> 39:19.182
I didn't know you'd moved in.

39:20.125 --> 39:22.924
So, what do you think of the place?

39:22.925 --> 39:24.405
Yeah, it's great.

39:24.565 --> 39:25.725
Good.

39:25.885 --> 39:27.365
I love it.

39:27.485 --> 39:29.285
I'm parched.

39:34.125 --> 39:35.375
I like it cold.

39:37.725 --> 39:40.564
Ice Cold In Alex, do you know that
film?

39:40.565 --> 39:43.005
- No.
- It's an oldie.

39:48.805 --> 39:53.445
Mm. Boy wonder needs to fit a new
washer on this tap.

39:53.565 --> 39:55.765
That's a builder's cliche.

39:55.965 --> 39:58.084
You're building
the Taj Mahal for other people

39:58.085 --> 40:00.084
and your own doors are hanging
off their hinges.

40:00.085 --> 40:01.565
Hmm.

40:04.925 --> 40:07.444
Daniel was telling me how you met.

40:07.445 --> 40:08.805
Very romantic.

40:09.005 --> 40:12.004
- Not really, I mean...
- Not the setting.

40:12.005 --> 40:15.284
You asking him for help and him
finding your bag and...

40:15.285 --> 40:19.119
...him finding your bag
and you asking him out.

40:19.165 --> 40:23.285
- He asked me out.
- Oh. I got that wrong.

40:23.485 --> 40:27.925
No, I did ask him for help
and he did find my bag,

40:28.085 --> 40:29.564
but then he gave me his card.

40:29.565 --> 40:31.565
His business card?

40:31.725 --> 40:35.564
Very suave. And so you looked at his
card and thought,

40:35.565 --> 40:37.325
"That's my man."

40:37.445 --> 40:39.364
No, I chucked it in the bin,
actually.

40:39.365 --> 40:42.366
- I thought you rang him?
- Yeah, I did.

40:42.367 --> 40:45.564
- Later.
- Oh, but how did you have his number?

40:45.565 --> 40:48.084
Oh, because I fished the card out
again.

40:48.085 --> 40:51.669
- Sorry, I'm annoying you.
- No, you're not.

40:51.725 --> 40:53.724
It's just like it's an exam
or something.

40:53.725 --> 40:55.724
Sorry, darling,
I didn't mean to annoy you,

40:55.725 --> 40:58.644
it's just I always like hearing how
people met, you know?

40:58.645 --> 41:02.085
The circumstances
and the coincidences.

41:02.205 --> 41:05.165
I met Daniel's mother at school.

41:05.285 --> 41:08.445
Hmm. Have you met Daniel's mother?

41:08.565 --> 41:10.649
- No.
- I'm sure you will.

41:11.245 --> 41:12.924
We grew apart, unfortunately,

41:12.925 --> 41:16.509
but Daniel has a good relationship
with her.

41:17.005 --> 41:19.604
- You want to ring someone?
- No.

41:19.605 --> 41:23.105
I thought you were reaching for your
phone.

41:23.165 --> 41:24.165
No.

41:31.205 --> 41:33.872
- Well, I should get going.
- OK.

41:43.125 --> 41:47.245
I'm so sorry about your mother.

41:49.325 --> 41:52.742
- That you lost her in that way.
- Thanks.

41:54.285 --> 41:57.005
- Awful.
- Yeah.

41:57.085 --> 41:58.444
I remember it being in the news.

41:58.445 --> 42:00.344
I don't want to talk about it.

42:00.345 --> 42:01.904
There's no need to take that tone.

42:01.905 --> 42:04.084
Well, you're making
me feel uncomfortable.

42:04.085 --> 42:06.084
- I apologise.
- And I'd like you to leave.

42:06.085 --> 42:08.684
Oh, just hang on a minute. I'd like
you to leave! Hang on a second.

42:08.685 --> 42:11.804
- I'd like you to leave!
- Will you calm down and listen?!

42:11.805 --> 42:14.364
I will leave, I want to, and I will.

42:14.365 --> 42:16.644
As soon as we sort this out,
cos you're going over the top here

42:16.645 --> 42:18.844
and I need to explain myself
and set you straight.

42:18.845 --> 42:21.262
No, no, no, get away from me.

42:23.365 --> 42:24.765
Help. Help.

42:27.725 --> 42:29.565
- Emma.
- Help!

42:31.285 --> 42:34.085
Emma, come away from there. Emma.

42:34.205 --> 42:35.645
No.
