03:53.199 --> 03:54.962
- Fuck!
- It's not there.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.263
It's in the kitchen where you left it.

03:57.370 --> 03:59.235
How'd you get in?

04:02.008 --> 04:03.976
You have a nice family.

04:06.446 --> 04:09.006
They're fine. Alive.

04:09.115 --> 04:11.447
Asleep.

04:13.620 --> 04:15.781
- Are you gonna kill me?
- If I was gonna kill you...

04:15.888 --> 04:18.288
I'd have done it when you walked
to the car this morning-

04:18.391 --> 04:21.360
been gone by the time
your body hit the sidewalk.

04:21.461 --> 04:25.363
- Then why are you here?
- To talk.

04:25.465 --> 04:28.764
But, Mike, if you make me kill you,
you will not go alone.

04:28.868 --> 04:31.268
Sit.

04:43.716 --> 04:45.616
Are you a good man, Inspector?

04:47.220 --> 04:49.882
- I think.
- And yet you've killed men.

04:51.891 --> 04:54.553
- Yes.
- I'm gonna ask you a question.

04:54.661 --> 04:58.620
How you answer it
will determine how this night ends.

04:58.731 --> 05:03.031
How does a good man
decide when to kill?

05:04.570 --> 05:07.971
The man you've been chasing
is a killer, a ghost.

05:11.077 --> 05:16.014
Rumor has it that he works for a group
known only as "the organization."

05:16.115 --> 05:18.310
So secret, no one knows it exists.

05:18.418 --> 05:22.320
It takes no sides,
yet it has ties to every government.

05:23.856 --> 05:26.484
Its sole purpose is
the training and conditioning...

05:26.592 --> 05:28.492
of professional killers.

05:29.595 --> 05:32.587
These men are selected at birth-

05:32.699 --> 05:34.860
rejects, orphans-

05:34.967 --> 05:38.425
all of them unwanted and disposable.

05:38.538 --> 05:41.939
They are made experts
in every aspect ofcombat...

05:42.041 --> 05:44.373
and programmed for one purpose:

05:44.477 --> 05:47.037
to kill.

05:47.146 --> 05:50.946
The man you have been chasing
for the last three years, Inspector...

05:51.050 --> 05:53.678
is the very best of them.

05:53.786 --> 05:55.686
Put him there.

06:05.398 --> 06:08.424
You shouldn't have
stolen from me, Brother.

06:08.534 --> 06:10.229
Now you must pay.

06:20.947 --> 06:23.006
Why you do that kind of thing?

06:25.017 --> 06:26.348
Still waiting.

06:26.452 --> 06:28.920
I'm sorry.

06:29.021 --> 06:30.921
What happened to his voice?

06:31.023 --> 06:33.014
He made me swallow.

06:33.126 --> 06:35.424
What did you do to his voice?

06:35.528 --> 06:39.624
Nothing, Ovie.
Exactly as he was delivered.

06:39.732 --> 06:41.962
Delivered?

06:42.068 --> 06:44.559
You didn't find him?

06:44.670 --> 06:47.195
No. A contractor.
An American.

06:50.309 --> 06:52.436
Swallow what?

06:55.681 --> 06:58.047
- Swallow what?
- A bomb.

06:58.151 --> 07:01.143
A bomb. A bomb.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.381
Run!

07:11.464 --> 07:14.433
We have all heard your theories, Inspector.

07:14.534 --> 07:16.832
This isn't a theory.

07:16.936 --> 07:20.963
This is our guy-
no motive, no forensic evidence, no witnesses.

07:21.073 --> 07:23.098
He's a- He's a ghost.

07:23.209 --> 07:26.474
And how long have you been
chasing this "ghost"?

07:26.579 --> 07:28.479
Three years.

07:28.581 --> 07:31.948
Well, thank goodness you have Interpol
to finance your persistence, huh?

07:32.051 --> 07:34.952
You see, Inspector,
despite being the anus of the third world...

07:35.054 --> 07:37.579
we attempt to have
competent police work here.

07:37.690 --> 07:40.750
And it is our belief that Bwana Ovie
was killed by his own brother.

07:40.860 --> 07:43.260
Oh, so he choked down
a pound of C-4...

07:43.362 --> 07:45.694
and knocked on Ovie's door?

07:45.798 --> 07:48.358
Probably.

07:48.468 --> 07:52.871
general, this man truly is
the best at what he does.

07:52.972 --> 07:56.772
He is likely responsible
for over 100 deaths.

07:56.876 --> 07:59.037
Let me show you what I mean.

08:00.413 --> 08:03.143
This is Ovie.

08:07.954 --> 08:10.752
And these are just
the ones we know about.

08:11.858 --> 08:14.292
Are you beginning
to get the picture?

08:36.782 --> 08:39.546
They might kill you for that.

08:41.254 --> 08:44.690
For what you're doing to that whiskey-
brutalizing it with ice.

08:47.693 --> 08:50.685
But never more than two cubes.
It waters down the scotch.

08:52.832 --> 08:54.732
- Oh.
- I-I'm sorry.

08:54.834 --> 08:58.565
Aftermath of my pretentious
ex-husband, I'm afraid.

08:58.671 --> 09:00.935
No.

09:02.642 --> 09:05.202
I'm June. And you are?

09:08.314 --> 09:10.782
This is where you tell me your name.

09:12.118 --> 09:14.313
Excuse me.

11:05.331 --> 11:07.424
Africa job complete.

11:07.533 --> 11:10.468
The money has been wired
to your account.

11:10.569 --> 11:14.198
Nice work. Regrettably,
the next target date...

11:14.306 --> 11:17.241
has been moved up
at the client's request.

11:17.343 --> 11:21.177
And the client wishes it
to be public.

11:21.280 --> 11:24.875
I've planned
something more... subtle.

11:24.984 --> 11:26.975
I've made preparations.

11:27.086 --> 11:30.078
Incumbent Russian president
Mikhail Belicoff's...

11:30.189 --> 11:33.090
recent political shift
is in direct conflict...

11:33.192 --> 11:37.993
with our client's interests and threatens
their control of the Russian government.

11:38.097 --> 11:40.031
The client needs it to be public.

11:40.132 --> 11:43.033
Do you accept the new parameters?

11:45.438 --> 11:49.272
-Yes.
-We appreciate you breaking your normal protocol.

11:49.375 --> 11:52.003
The specifics are being uploaded.

12:07.493 --> 12:09.791
I, for one, will not let
their cowardice deter me.

12:25.845 --> 12:30.248
Belicoff! Belicoff! Belicoff!

12:59.111 --> 13:02.808
Mr. Belicoff? I'm sorry.
In light of your political positions...

13:02.915 --> 13:05.509
do you think the hard-liners
will continue to support your reelection?

13:05.618 --> 13:07.518
One only needs to look at-

13:58.671 --> 14:02.402
We have a problem.
There was a witness in Saint Petersburg.

14:02.508 --> 14:05.033
How reliable are your sources?

14:05.144 --> 14:07.339
Impeccable, as always.

14:07.446 --> 14:09.937
Interpol has arranged a pickup.

14:10.049 --> 14:13.212
- Will you intercept?
- Yes.

14:13.319 --> 14:15.651
Uploading data.

15:24.023 --> 15:26.218
I can't be sure.

15:26.325 --> 15:28.623
He never works again so quickly.

15:28.727 --> 15:31.457
But the Russians say that Belicoff
was grazed by a single bullet...

15:31.563 --> 15:33.690
from over four kilometers away.

15:33.799 --> 15:36.734
But it definitely sounds like him.

15:36.835 --> 15:38.735
Yes, sir.

15:38.837 --> 15:42.102
Well, what bothers me
is that he missed.

15:42.207 --> 15:45.267
Yes, sir.
I know what this investigation has cost.

15:45.377 --> 15:48.107
I- I understand.

15:48.213 --> 15:50.807
- I just need a little more time.
- Sir, you need to see this.

15:50.916 --> 15:52.816
Sorry, sir.
I'm gonna have to call you back.

15:55.888 --> 15:57.583
Okay.

15:57.690 --> 16:00.659
- He shoots the bodyguard
to get a clean shot at Belicoff.

16:00.759 --> 16:04.388
Yeah. He splits these two civilians
by a couple of inches. Keep watching.

16:04.496 --> 16:06.862
Keep an eye on the bodyguard.
See that?

16:06.966 --> 16:09.093
Back it up.
Back it up again.

16:10.736 --> 16:13.204
That's an awful lot
of arterial spray for a miss.

16:13.305 --> 16:15.330
Sir, you have call.

16:15.441 --> 16:18.137
- This is Whittier.
- Sir, they found Belicoff's shooter.

16:18.243 --> 16:21.269
- They found him?
- Yes. Tip from a hotel concierge.

16:21.380 --> 16:23.610
- Concierge where?
- Grand Hotel.

16:23.716 --> 16:27.208
- They recognized him from a picture.
- A picture?

16:27.319 --> 16:29.719
- Where the hell did they get a picture?
- I don't know, sir.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.848
All right.
I'm on my way.

16:34.426 --> 16:36.326
They found him.

16:36.428 --> 16:38.919
Contact the Russian Secret Police
in Saint Petersburg...

16:39.031 --> 16:41.192
and tell them Interpol has jurisdiction.

16:41.300 --> 16:45.566
They're to keep him under surveillance only.
No one moves until we get there. No one!

16:52.745 --> 16:54.736
Was the target not at the location?

16:54.847 --> 16:59.011
The girl was there, but she was no witness.
She'd never seen me before.

16:59.118 --> 17:01.848
We will be unable to transmit payment...

17:01.954 --> 17:04.752
for the Belicoff assignment
as the task was not completed.

17:04.857 --> 17:08.884
No. He took a direct hit through the nasal cavity.
I watched it myself.

17:08.993 --> 17:11.326
Please wait.

17:11.430 --> 17:14.694
Uploading live news feed.

17:14.800 --> 17:17.701
The West, so afraid of my message...

17:17.803 --> 17:20.067
that cowardly violence
is their only response.

17:20.172 --> 17:23.266
- And that was the scene
outside of Saint Petersburg.

17:23.375 --> 17:26.935
Who was the client?

17:27.046 --> 17:28.775
Answer me!

17:29.948 --> 17:32.348
Who ordered the hit on Belicoff?

17:34.486 --> 17:38.252
If you set me up, I will find you...

17:38.357 --> 17:41.053
and I will burn that building
to the ground around you.

18:01.246 --> 18:03.146
Mike Whittier, Interpol.

18:03.248 --> 18:05.182
What's the status of my suspect?

18:05.284 --> 18:07.218
I was told you were coming, Inspector.

18:07.319 --> 18:10.811
I am Captain Gudnayev,
Saint Petersburg Militsiya.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.619
Please, make yourself comfortable.

18:13.725 --> 18:16.319
- My men are almost in position.
- In position for what?

18:16.428 --> 18:19.397
We have been informed that
the suspect intends to flee.

18:19.498 --> 18:22.262
- My orders are to seek-
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Orders? Orders from who?

18:22.367 --> 18:26.303
-Interpol has jurisdiction here.
-Militsiya's only responsible for the extraction.

18:26.405 --> 18:30.307
Captain Gudnayev is not directing this operation,
I'm afraid, Inspector. I am.

18:30.409 --> 18:32.673
I'm Chief Agent Yuri Marklov
of the F.S.B.

18:32.778 --> 18:35.178
The F.S.B. Why the hell...

18:35.280 --> 18:37.373
is the Russian Secret Police
involved in this?

18:41.854 --> 18:44.414
- They're going in.
- I advise you to get your men out of there.

18:44.523 --> 18:46.514
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.957
I assure you, these men are capable
of handling this situation.

18:49.061 --> 18:52.030
Shoot on sight.

18:52.131 --> 18:55.828
Do not give that order!

19:14.153 --> 19:16.246
47, it's Diana.

19:16.355 --> 19:18.789
I could be retired
for contacting you directly.

19:21.260 --> 19:24.354
The client was Belicoff.

19:25.731 --> 19:28.131
Your location has been compromised.

19:50.088 --> 19:51.020
Come on.

21:04.529 --> 21:09.091
Stay here. Cover the elevator.
Call me on my cell and tell me where it stops.

22:00.285 --> 22:02.378
- Yeah.
- I've got five dead bodies in the lift, sir.

22:02.487 --> 22:05.047
None of them our boy.

22:05.157 --> 22:08.854
He's on the third floor, sir! He must have
opened the doors from inside the shaft!

22:14.232 --> 22:16.564
Freeze!

22:21.306 --> 22:23.035
Get down!

22:25.077 --> 22:27.568
Get down!

22:42.394 --> 22:44.419
Fuck!

22:44.529 --> 22:47.726
Sir?

22:47.833 --> 22:49.767
We had him.

23:05.684 --> 23:08.915
- How many men did you lose?
- Sixteen dead.

23:09.020 --> 23:12.581
No! No, no.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Don't touch that!

23:12.691 --> 23:15.819
Where'd you get your fucking license?

23:15.927 --> 23:18.088
I need the room, Captain.

24:20.292 --> 24:22.817
Where does he get all this stuff?

24:22.928 --> 24:25.021
Can you make it work?

24:27.599 --> 24:29.829
Probably. Why?

24:35.540 --> 24:38.566
I've been looking
for you, Inspector.

24:38.677 --> 24:41.544
I think we started off
on the wrong foot.

24:41.646 --> 24:44.877
Who informed you
of the whereabouts of my guy?

24:46.551 --> 24:49.577
I believe it's time
we had a chat, you and I.

24:49.688 --> 24:51.451
Jenkins.

24:51.556 --> 24:53.854
Yes, sir.

25:00.932 --> 25:03.457
This, uh, assassin-

25:03.568 --> 25:07.231
my associates tell me
you believe him to be freelance.

25:07.339 --> 25:09.807
Your associates tell you that?

25:09.908 --> 25:12.536
You do not believe he is connected
with Central Intelligence Agency?

25:12.644 --> 25:14.373
Why do you ask?

25:14.479 --> 25:17.448
No reason. It just seems a bit naive.

25:17.549 --> 25:19.574
Well, it's a theory.

25:19.684 --> 25:24.747
Yes, a theory.
But a theory shared by Moscow.

25:24.856 --> 25:29.384
In accordance with Article 1764.3
of the E.U. Charter...

25:29.494 --> 25:33.555
any state matters which deal
directly with intelligence...

25:33.665 --> 25:35.792
shall be the sole jurisdiction
of the host country.

25:35.901 --> 25:38.301
Ah, and the lightbulb comes on.

25:38.403 --> 25:40.303
Took me a minute.
Must be the jet lag.

25:40.405 --> 25:42.737
You're telling me to fuck off?

25:42.841 --> 25:46.436
No, no. Of course not.
You are a good man, Michael.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.672
One of Interpol's best.

25:48.780 --> 25:53.240
But leave this intelligence work
to the F.S.B.

25:57.622 --> 25:59.522
And Belicoff?

26:04.763 --> 26:06.663
I'm sorry?

26:06.765 --> 26:11.031
You know, there's two things
wrong with this photograph.

26:11.136 --> 26:13.036
One, the footage
has been tampered with.

26:13.138 --> 26:16.596
Someone inserted that civilian
to cover up what actually happened.

26:17.642 --> 26:19.872
Hmm.

26:19.978 --> 26:24.779
- And the second thing?
- My boy doesn't miss.

27:04.689 --> 27:07.419
- Delivery.
- You're supposed to leave those at the desk.

27:08.526 --> 27:11.359
Mr. Belicoff sent them.

27:19.170 --> 27:21.570
Make a sound, I'll end your life.
You understand?

27:21.673 --> 27:24.665
Who else is inside?

27:24.776 --> 27:27.074
I know you-
from the street earlier today.

27:27.178 --> 27:28.873
- You're coming with me.
- I can't!

27:28.980 --> 27:31.608
Okay, okay!
I'll get my coat.

27:42.761 --> 27:46.356
- Where are you taking me?
- Somewhere safe.

27:46.464 --> 27:48.261
- Get in.
- Fuck you! I'm not getting in there!

27:48.366 --> 27:50.766
Aaah! There's a dead man in there!

27:53.338 --> 27:56.205
get me out of this car!

28:19.264 --> 28:22.256
Are you going to kill me?

28:29.040 --> 28:30.735
I'm gonna ask you some questions.

28:30.842 --> 28:35.176
Before today on the street,
have you overseen me?

28:35.280 --> 28:37.680
- Why were you there?
- My boyfriend.

28:37.782 --> 28:41.149
- He told me to meet his driver on that corner.
- Belicoff?

28:42.554 --> 28:44.784
How, after I put
a bullet through his head...

28:44.889 --> 28:46.914
was he able to give
that speech this afternoon?

28:50.628 --> 28:53.825
Then you're of no use to me.

28:53.932 --> 28:56.799
Wait! Wait! There is something.

28:57.635 --> 28:59.569
D-Doubles. Doubles-

28:59.671 --> 29:01.798
Mikhail has doubles,
just like Saddam Hussein.

29:01.906 --> 29:05.171
The man I shot was not an impostor.
Belicoff is dead.

29:21.493 --> 29:23.393
Why'd you tattoo your face?

29:23.495 --> 29:27.158
Because it's the only place
I knew Belicoff wouldn't hit.

29:33.738 --> 29:36.468
Tell me about Udre Belicoff.

29:37.575 --> 29:39.475
Mikhail's brother?

29:39.577 --> 29:42.808
He runs slave girls, drugs, weapons.

29:42.914 --> 29:44.882
Both the C.I.A. and F.S.B.
want him dead.

29:44.983 --> 29:48.248
- Mikhail's been protecting him.
- Get up.

29:49.354 --> 29:51.185
- Get up. You're coming with me.
- I can't.

29:51.289 --> 29:53.655
He'll kill me if he finds out
I left the apartment.

29:53.758 --> 29:56.727
Belicoff hired me to kill him.
Used you to set me up.

29:56.828 --> 29:58.728
The dead man in the trunk
was your driver.

30:03.134 --> 30:05.728
He was gonna use it on you.

30:05.837 --> 30:07.998
You're as good as dead without me.

30:10.875 --> 30:13.673
Where are you going?

30:14.813 --> 30:17.008
I'm gonna finish the job
I was hired to do...

30:17.115 --> 30:19.913
and find out who's behind this.

30:32.664 --> 30:36.191
- I need to talk to you.
- I need coffee.

30:36.301 --> 30:39.293
Follow me.

30:39.404 --> 30:41.304
We have three roadblocks.

30:41.406 --> 30:44.068
Here, here, here.

30:44.175 --> 30:47.110
We completely shut down
international airport.

30:47.212 --> 30:50.477
All border security has been tripled.
He cannot get out of city.

30:50.582 --> 30:53.983
- What about the train stations?
- Temporarily closed.

30:54.085 --> 30:58.545
- And Saint Petersburg Station?
- There are no trains leaving Russia
from this station.

30:58.656 --> 31:00.647
Only commuter trains
headed towards interior.

31:02.160 --> 31:05.755
What make you think
he go further into Russia?

31:05.864 --> 31:07.957
Because I know him
better than anyone.

31:11.669 --> 31:13.899
Thanks for the coffee.

31:29.187 --> 31:31.087
Go to the last platform and wait.

31:33.157 --> 31:35.387
- Why?
- Now.

31:58.850 --> 32:01.580
-Jenkins, anything?
- Nothing.

32:01.686 --> 32:03.586
Stay sharp.

32:05.623 --> 32:08.649
I don't know, sir.
It seems odd for him to come here.

32:08.760 --> 32:11.024
Trust me. This is where he'll be.

32:47.799 --> 32:49.858
Jenkins- bench, shaved head.

32:52.103 --> 32:54.037
Got him, boss.

33:06.884 --> 33:08.715
Fuck!

33:11.889 --> 33:14.357
Jenkins?

33:23.034 --> 33:26.765
I'm still on him, boss. Platform...

33:26.871 --> 33:29.203
number nine.

33:29.307 --> 33:31.537
Boss?

34:52.090 --> 34:53.681
Gotten slow.

34:57.228 --> 34:59.196
Tell me why.

35:00.765 --> 35:02.960
Why is there a hit on me?

35:07.505 --> 35:09.200
Stay here.

36:31.923 --> 36:34.255
How about dying
with a little dignity?

39:48.586 --> 39:52.818
You think it's done?
It's just beginning.

40:06.103 --> 40:08.537
I told you to wait.

40:08.639 --> 40:12.131
I know. I'm sorry.

40:23.421 --> 40:26.515
I- I know-

40:32.530 --> 40:34.691
Shh.

40:45.276 --> 40:47.642
Aaah!

40:47.745 --> 40:50.805
Freeze!

40:57.421 --> 41:00.390
You're the one who's been tracking me.

41:01.959 --> 41:04.257
The Russian Militsiya have got
the terminal locked down.

41:04.361 --> 41:06.591
If you need a hostage...

41:06.697 --> 41:09.530
take me.

41:09.633 --> 41:11.191
Come on.

41:11.302 --> 41:14.362
He hasn't seen your face.
He doesn't have to die.

41:14.472 --> 41:15.234
Take me instead.

41:39.029 --> 41:41.122
Please.

41:41.232 --> 41:44.099
Stop.

41:50.407 --> 41:52.307
She saved your life.

42:20.604 --> 42:22.504
He said your ribs are broken.

42:22.606 --> 42:25.769
Unlucky.

42:28.746 --> 42:31.306
- You seem awfully calm, considering.
- Your assassin is dead.

42:33.417 --> 42:35.476
Why are you covering this up?

42:35.586 --> 42:37.679
You know that's not our killer.

42:37.788 --> 42:41.781
I told you before, Inspector,
this is no longer your affair.

42:41.892 --> 42:44.156
Now there are two ways
in which we may proceed.

42:44.261 --> 42:46.286
One, my men will
accompany you to the hospital...

42:46.397 --> 42:48.592
and, when you and your associate
are able to travel...

42:48.699 --> 42:51.099
they will escort you to the airport.

42:51.201 --> 42:54.762
Then I will write a report
extolling Interpol for its help.

42:54.872 --> 42:57.204
Medals will probably be involved.

42:57.308 --> 42:59.833
Or I can report your incompetence...

42:59.944 --> 43:02.606
and disregard for my nation's laws
to your superiors.

43:02.713 --> 43:05.841
This will undoubtedly find its way
to the state prosecutor in Moscow.

43:05.950 --> 43:10.649
So, how do you think
we should proceed, huh?

43:15.426 --> 43:17.326
How about...

43:17.428 --> 43:19.953
go fuck yourself.

43:39.917 --> 43:42.351
I was running out of oxygen in there!

43:42.453 --> 43:44.353
- Don't be dramatic.
- Dramatic?

43:44.455 --> 43:46.980
- I got rid of the body.
- I've been there for hours!

43:47.091 --> 43:49.787
I brought you breakfast.

44:16.954 --> 44:19.718
I'd thank you
if I wasn't so mad at you.

44:19.823 --> 44:22.291
Look at me.

44:23.994 --> 44:27.691
Back at the station, you interfered.

44:27.798 --> 44:29.766
I'm sorry.

44:29.867 --> 44:31.767
I can't allow that.

44:33.637 --> 44:36.231
- I swear I'll never-
- Stop talking.

44:38.375 --> 44:41.833
If you're looking
for a reason not to kill me...

44:41.945 --> 44:44.812
I don't really have one.

44:46.150 --> 44:48.914
I'm not a whore by choice.

44:49.019 --> 44:52.978
Belicoff owns me.
I'm his property.

44:53.090 --> 44:57.891
Would you like to know
how much he paid for me? 300, American.

45:00.798 --> 45:03.733
I've tried to escape.
The last time-

45:47.644 --> 45:49.874
It is a strange thing to wish to die.

45:56.353 --> 45:58.514
So, areyou...

45:58.622 --> 46:01.250
going to kill me?

46:03.527 --> 46:05.620
No.

46:07.364 --> 46:10.299
You don't want to fuck me
and you don't want to kill me.

46:10.400 --> 46:13.426
I've never felt so much indifference
in my entire life.

46:17.207 --> 46:20.973
- If you ever again interfere with me like that-
- I won't.

46:22.379 --> 46:24.347
- Are we clear?
- Yeah.

46:26.984 --> 46:30.147
Eat your sandwich.
I need to get some sleep.

46:34.158 --> 46:36.058
- You know-
- Nika-

46:36.160 --> 46:39.357
- Yes?
- Stop talking or I'll put you back in the trunk.

47:07.257 --> 47:09.191
Shit.

47:27.010 --> 47:28.375
Da.

47:56.006 --> 47:59.442
I gotta give it to you, sir. Pretty slick.

48:00.344 --> 48:02.710
Go fuck yourself.

48:02.813 --> 48:06.408
It was a pretty stupid idea actually.

48:06.516 --> 48:10.543
If we get caught, we'll be making
snow cones in Siberia for the next 20 years.

48:10.654 --> 48:12.554
Yet here we sit.

48:12.656 --> 48:14.556
Shh!

48:19.096 --> 48:20.563
Belicoff.

48:20.664 --> 48:23.963
Shit! Hide that thing.

48:33.710 --> 48:35.439
We came to see Chief Agent Yuri.

48:35.545 --> 48:37.740
- What's the problem?
- Chief Agent is very busy man.

48:37.848 --> 48:41.147
He asked you to go directly to the airport.
We'll escort you there immediately.

48:42.452 --> 48:44.682
Okay.

49:13.550 --> 49:15.450
It's for you.

49:18.889 --> 49:22.120
After all these years,
I'd think you'd trust me a little more than this.

49:22.225 --> 49:24.125
Tell me what you know.

49:24.227 --> 49:26.661
Officially, nothing.

49:26.763 --> 49:30.859
Unofficially, it appears
your employer has thrown you to the wolves.

49:30.968 --> 49:32.868
- Why?
- Apparently...

49:32.970 --> 49:34.961
Belicoff's softening political stance
and his refusal...

49:35.072 --> 49:37.870
to cooperate with the hard-liners
upset a lot of people.

49:37.975 --> 49:40.205
They ordered the hit
and replaced him with one of their own.

49:40.310 --> 49:44.007
Seems you and your friend here are the only ones
who know Belicoff is actually a double.

49:44.114 --> 49:46.708
What's the C.I.A.'s position?

49:46.817 --> 49:49.877
The company usually likes to be
on the side of whoever wins.

49:49.987 --> 49:52.012
Take the envelope from the girl.

49:55.692 --> 49:57.557
Ah.

49:57.661 --> 50:00.528
Udre Belicoff,
Mikhail's younger brother.

50:00.630 --> 50:02.996
Rumor is you'd like him to disappear.

50:03.100 --> 50:05.364
- That is the rumor.
- I'd like to help.

50:05.469 --> 50:07.994
How's killing Udre Belicoff
gonna help you?

50:08.105 --> 50:11.541
- Let me worry about that.
- Well, that might be worth something.

50:11.641 --> 50:14.508
- What do you want for your trouble?
- Small favor.

50:20.817 --> 50:23.684
This is a small favor?
I don't think I can do this.

50:23.787 --> 50:26.017
- Not in your time frame.
- Keep reading.

50:26.123 --> 50:27.590
Jesus Christ.

50:27.691 --> 50:29.625
Tell me this isn't
what I think it is.

50:29.726 --> 50:32.559
Okay. It's not what you think it is.

50:32.662 --> 50:37.122
But I'd expect the last thing you'd want
is for me to be arrested with that file.

50:40.704 --> 50:44.140
Okay. I'll try.

50:44.241 --> 50:46.128
- Thank you.
- Yeah,you're welcome.

50:46.128 --> 50:50.997
We know Udre's been planning something
with a German arms dealer named Price.

50:51.099 --> 50:53.431
The two have never met.
That's your way in.

50:53.535 --> 50:56.470
Intercept Price,
and you get a shot at Udre.

50:56.571 --> 50:58.471
I'll get you his file.

50:58.573 --> 51:00.837
They're meeting
in Istanbul in two days.

51:20.896 --> 51:23.694
Good morning.
Have you slept at all?

51:23.798 --> 51:25.129
Some.

51:28.303 --> 51:30.965
You know, you could sleep in the bed.
I won't bite you.

51:32.507 --> 51:34.407
Unless you pay me.

51:41.816 --> 51:43.716
It's not polite to stare.

51:59.467 --> 52:02.027
So, when are you
gonna tell me your name?

52:02.137 --> 52:04.935
- Get dressed.
- What for?

52:05.040 --> 52:09.033
We're going to dinner.
We need to buy you a new dress.

52:10.879 --> 52:14.747
You know, you're really quite charming
when you aren't killing people.

52:45.914 --> 52:48.940
- This place looks nice.
- Yeah.

52:49.050 --> 52:51.211
- Don't you think?
- Mm-hmm.

52:53.555 --> 52:55.989
Wait here.

53:37.465 --> 53:41.162
Hey! What'd you do, eat without me?

53:41.269 --> 53:44.500
- How did you know I wouldn't just take off?
- I didn't. Come on.

53:44.606 --> 53:46.437
We have dinner reservations at 8:00.

53:54.115 --> 53:56.345
Jenks, how do you feel?

53:56.451 --> 53:59.978
My pride hurts worse than my arms.

54:00.088 --> 54:04.548
- Any word?
- The sketch is out to every
Interpol substation in Europe.

54:04.659 --> 54:07.355
Train stations, airports,
border crossings and-

54:08.763 --> 54:11.425
- What's that?
- This is what I wanted to show you.

54:11.533 --> 54:14.832
It's every appearance
Belicoff has made within the last 12 months.

54:14.936 --> 54:18.804
This is from the speech he made
in London on May the 7th.

54:18.907 --> 54:23.640
And this is from some shitty political luncheon
he had in northern Georgia.

54:23.745 --> 54:25.804
Someone took a photo
from a mobile phone.

54:25.914 --> 54:29.145
- Look at the date.
- May 7.

54:29.250 --> 54:31.912
- How's that possible?
- I can't be sure...

54:32.020 --> 54:34.648
but unless he's figured out
how to be in two places at once-

54:34.756 --> 54:37.725
- Ha. He has a double.
- He's certainly paranoid enough.

54:37.826 --> 54:39.817
That explains the arterial spray.

54:39.928 --> 54:41.828
I hope he had health benefits.

54:48.703 --> 54:51.570
When I was a little girl, I had this little squirrel-

54:51.673 --> 54:53.834
you know,
with black stripes on the back?

54:53.942 --> 54:56.570
- A chipmunk.
- Oh, yeah, that's right. A chipmunk.

54:56.678 --> 54:58.839
His name was Tishka.

55:00.348 --> 55:03.010
I'm sorry, sir,
but this is for another gentleman.

55:03.118 --> 55:05.109
- Table 26?
- That's right.

55:07.489 --> 55:09.582
My mistake.

55:11.159 --> 55:14.128
You know what table that is?

55:14.229 --> 55:15.924
I saw the layout when we came in.

55:16.030 --> 55:19.261
- Do you remember everything you see?
- No, not everything.

55:19.367 --> 55:20.959
What's the soup of the day?

55:21.069 --> 55:25.403
Red lentil and mint with sautéed onions
and diced tomatoes.

55:25.507 --> 55:28.067
The woman sitting two tables behind you-
what's she wearing?

55:28.176 --> 55:30.736
- With the red hair and the silk dress, facing you?
- Yeah.

55:30.845 --> 55:33.473
That's not a woman.

55:45.093 --> 55:47.823
What color underwear am I wearing?

55:47.929 --> 55:49.897
You're not wearing any underwear.

56:02.911 --> 56:05.812
Come with us, sir.
Here we go. It's gonna be all right.

56:07.182 --> 56:09.207
Nika, ask for the check.

56:09.317 --> 56:11.945
- But I'm not done!
- Then hurry.

56:17.292 --> 56:19.783
You scratch what I said
about you being charming.

56:32.740 --> 56:34.833
Sorry, sir.

56:55.597 --> 56:57.656
Sheiße.

57:14.349 --> 57:17.045
Mr. Price...

57:17.151 --> 57:19.381
thank you for the introduction
to Udre Belicoff.

57:22.657 --> 57:25.683
Little help, please.

57:40.375 --> 57:42.741
- What the fuck?
- Let's go.

57:42.844 --> 57:45.074
- What?
- Now.

57:53.254 --> 57:55.484
Well, that was lovely.

57:55.590 --> 57:58.286
Right up to the time
you dragged me out by my hair.

58:00.228 --> 58:02.253
Undress me.

58:02.363 --> 58:04.422
So very good at firearms.

58:04.532 --> 58:07.467
Not so good with
ladies' undergarments.

58:09.470 --> 58:11.802
Careful. I'm not wearing any panties.

58:11.906 --> 58:14.204
Nika, you're drunk.

58:14.309 --> 58:16.038
And?

58:16.144 --> 58:19.580
- And this is a very bad idea.
- Oh.

58:20.515 --> 58:24.110
- You mean this?
- Yes, that.

58:24.218 --> 58:26.413
How about this?

58:28.723 --> 58:30.623
Definitely that.

58:33.127 --> 58:35.322
Then...

58:35.430 --> 58:38.160
this must be really bad.

59:22.043 --> 59:24.034
Give me case.

59:24.145 --> 59:25.772
Mr. Price!

59:25.880 --> 59:27.973
So,you took it upon yourself...

59:28.082 --> 59:30.482
to change our appointment.

59:30.585 --> 59:33.884
- How forward of you.
- As I told your men downstairs...

59:33.988 --> 59:37.355
I was attacked earlier tonight
by some lunatic.

59:37.458 --> 59:40.325
- Common sense dictated-
- Common sense should have dictated...

59:40.428 --> 59:43.397
you not abuse my good nature.

59:43.498 --> 59:45.398
Sit.

59:52.173 --> 59:55.165
I was just going over
a few of my lines...

59:55.276 --> 59:57.540
with some of your competitors.

01:00:01.482 --> 01:00:03.848
Lines.

01:00:03.951 --> 01:00:06.044
A few of my lines.

01:00:06.154 --> 01:00:08.122
Do you get it?

01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:10.981
Where was I?

01:00:13.327 --> 01:00:15.227
He's not Price.

01:00:25.473 --> 01:00:27.373
Da.

01:00:30.111 --> 01:00:32.136
This is the, uh- the Kedr.

01:00:32.246 --> 01:00:35.147
Nine-millimeter, compact.

01:00:35.249 --> 01:00:37.877
It's, uh, less than two kilograms.

01:00:37.985 --> 01:00:40.852
Select fire single,
or fully automatic.

01:00:42.323 --> 01:00:44.257
Empty-

01:00:44.358 --> 01:00:47.418
and safe.

01:00:47.528 --> 01:00:50.861
Or if you are looking for an assault rifle...

01:00:50.965 --> 01:00:55.163
I have the M203 with
under-barrel grenade launcher.

01:00:55.269 --> 01:00:57.430
A lot of third-world dictators...

01:00:57.538 --> 01:01:00.029
got a lot of 7.62s stockpiled.

01:01:00.141 --> 01:01:03.076
Saves them from having to buy ammo.

01:01:03.177 --> 01:01:07.841
Everything here is
available in bulk, of course.

01:01:07.949 --> 01:01:09.974
Prices not negotiable.

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:15.354
Any questions, Mr. Price?

01:01:15.456 --> 01:01:19.222
Yeah. What about the little one there?

01:01:20.428 --> 01:01:23.090
Here. I show you.

01:01:23.197 --> 01:01:26.564
This is a Makarov.22.

01:01:26.667 --> 01:01:29.067
- A favorite of the K.G.B.
- No. No.

01:01:29.170 --> 01:01:32.537
Particularly effective
in the right hands.

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:33.902
But for a real target...

01:01:34.008 --> 01:01:36.476
you need to find a soft spot.

01:01:36.577 --> 01:01:38.875
Whoa. Hold up. Hey.

01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:40.971
Wait. This is not a Kedr.

01:01:41.082 --> 01:01:43.243
It's a Chinese copy.

01:01:43.351 --> 01:01:46.377
In fact, I don't know if it's the drugs,
or if you're usually this inept...

01:01:46.487 --> 01:01:48.580
but you've been wrong
about most of these weapons.

01:01:48.689 --> 01:01:51.089
If the gun you're holding
is as cheap as this one...

01:01:51.192 --> 01:01:54.992
even if you could manage to shoot her
in the eye- and I'm not saying you could-

01:01:55.096 --> 01:01:57.155
you wouldn't kill her.

01:02:03.571 --> 01:02:04.503
Oh!

01:03:36.597 --> 01:03:40.431
- Why are you doing this to me?
- I need you to help me with your brother.

01:03:42.570 --> 01:03:45.733
Mikhail? Fine. Fuck him.

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:48.604
I do whatever you want.

01:03:48.709 --> 01:03:50.643
What the fuck do you want me to do?

01:03:52.346 --> 01:03:54.314
Just this.

01:05:07.321 --> 01:05:10.848
You know, it says here that when
the male penguin meets the female penguin...

01:05:10.958 --> 01:05:14.325
he knows in the first 10 seconds
whether he's gonna like her or not.

01:05:16.097 --> 01:05:17.997
Are you listening?

01:05:18.099 --> 01:05:20.829
I'm listening.
I read that.

01:05:22.003 --> 01:05:24.130
These articles are full of shit.

01:05:24.238 --> 01:05:27.730
- Why do you buy these magazines?
- For the advertisements.

01:05:29.243 --> 01:05:31.905
What do you need
luggage like this for?

01:05:32.013 --> 01:05:35.039
Because that perfectly holds
my Blaser sniper rifle and.245.

01:05:35.149 --> 01:05:38.084
And a gag for irritating,
talkative little girls like yourself.

01:05:38.185 --> 01:05:40.153
You want me to stop and get it out?

01:05:40.254 --> 01:05:42.381
I don't know.
You think we have time for foreplay?

01:05:56.670 --> 01:06:01.437
You know, when I was a little girl,
my father raised grapes.

01:06:03.277 --> 01:06:06.371
And I told him that one day
I'd own my own vineyard.

01:06:14.622 --> 01:06:16.590
It looks nice.

01:06:22.730 --> 01:06:24.789
We need to get off the road.

01:06:51.759 --> 01:06:54.250
Jenks.

01:06:55.396 --> 01:06:58.126
Is that his suitcase?
How did we get that?

01:06:58.232 --> 01:07:01.030
As a consolation prize
Captain Gudnayev sent me.

01:07:01.135 --> 01:07:04.127
Our boy's stuff from the hotel in St. Pete
in case it might help.

01:07:04.238 --> 01:07:06.138
- Anything?
- Not much.

01:07:07.775 --> 01:07:10.073
There is this.

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:14.607
What do you make of this?

01:07:19.553 --> 01:07:21.453
"Trust unto god...

01:07:21.555 --> 01:07:23.955
and he shall direct your path."

01:07:24.058 --> 01:07:26.151
- It's-
- That's Psalms.

01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:29.423
I never figured our boy as the religious type.

01:07:29.530 --> 01:07:31.122
That's strange.

01:07:49.116 --> 01:07:51.050
Nika.

01:07:51.152 --> 01:07:53.052
I have to go.

01:07:56.657 --> 01:07:58.989
So much for happy endings.

01:08:02.963 --> 01:08:05.227
I don't want you to do this.

01:08:06.934 --> 01:08:08.868
Belicoff needs to die.

01:08:10.337 --> 01:08:13.204
I don't care about that.
Not anymore.

01:08:13.307 --> 01:08:17.140
As long as he's alive,
they will never stop looking for you.

01:08:52.479 --> 01:08:54.447
Take this.

01:08:54.548 --> 01:08:58.609
At the next station,
get off the train as soon as it stops.

01:08:58.719 --> 01:09:00.845
Move with the crowd.

01:09:02.423 --> 01:09:04.357
But I don't even know your name.

01:09:04.457 --> 01:09:08.519
The place I was raised, they didn't give us names.
They gave us numbers.

01:09:09.630 --> 01:09:11.962
Mine was 47.

01:09:14.033 --> 01:09:16.264
Well, that explains a lot.

01:09:17.971 --> 01:09:20.634
- How will I find you?
- Don't worry.

01:09:20.741 --> 01:09:22.037
I'll find you.

01:09:23.210 --> 01:09:25.542
What are you going to do?

01:09:25.645 --> 01:09:27.546
What I do.

01:10:32.813 --> 01:10:35.782
You're drunk.

01:10:35.883 --> 01:10:39.614
You don't want to drink
with your new president, tovarich?

01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:42.120
We are celebrating. Yes?

01:10:43.757 --> 01:10:45.554
All the evidence is erased.

01:10:45.659 --> 01:10:48.651
Mikhail Belicoff.

01:10:50.931 --> 01:10:53.365
And his pathetic brother Udre.

01:10:55.936 --> 01:10:57.836
Now I'm the one and only.

01:10:57.938 --> 01:11:00.600
And the one man I have
asked you to kill...

01:11:00.708 --> 01:11:02.869
the only one who can expose us...

01:11:02.976 --> 01:11:05.376
is the one man not in this room!

01:11:07.481 --> 01:11:09.972
So...

01:11:10.084 --> 01:11:12.052
tell me, tovarich.

01:11:12.152 --> 01:11:14.746
What exactly
have you done to find him?

01:11:14.855 --> 01:11:17.722
It seems if we wait long enough...

01:11:17.825 --> 01:11:19.725
he will find you.

01:11:19.827 --> 01:11:22.660
Us, Tovarich Yuri.

01:11:22.763 --> 01:11:26.756
- He will find us.
- The organization has sent in their best operatives.

01:11:26.867 --> 01:11:30.530
I know.
Don't let your incompetence hinder them.

01:11:30.637 --> 01:11:32.832
We will not have
this conversation again.

01:11:50.958 --> 01:11:53.927
Three hours ago, Belicoff's brother Udre
was found dead in Istanbul.

01:11:54.027 --> 01:11:56.894
They're waiting for the body
to arrive in Moscow for the funeral.

01:11:56.997 --> 01:11:58.589
Heads up.

01:11:58.699 --> 01:12:01.133
Michael. How's things going?

01:12:01.235 --> 01:12:04.898
Belicoff's brother has just been found murdered.
It's him, sir. It's our guy.

01:12:05.005 --> 01:12:06.973
He's setting Belicoff up.

01:12:07.074 --> 01:12:11.272
We're getting pressure from the ministry
and the E.U. to drop this investigation.

01:12:11.378 --> 01:12:15.405
- But, sir, the Russians will-
- The Russians are the ones leading the E.U. on this.

01:12:15.516 --> 01:12:17.711
They blatantly deny
your ghost exists...

01:12:17.818 --> 01:12:20.048
and have filed papers
with the minister's office...

01:12:20.154 --> 01:12:21.644
claiming you've
overstepped your authority.

01:12:21.755 --> 01:12:23.780
Who? Who brought those allegations?

01:12:23.891 --> 01:12:27.759
The F.S.B.
Specifically, Chief Agent Yuri Marklov.

01:12:27.861 --> 01:12:29.886
I need you to stop.

01:12:29.997 --> 01:12:33.831
No. You don't understand.
The F.S.B. is covering this up.

01:12:33.934 --> 01:12:36.425
He killed Belicoff's brother.
Now why?

01:12:36.537 --> 01:12:38.801
- Why would he do that, unless-
- Mikhail Belicoff...

01:12:38.906 --> 01:12:42.069
announced that he would attend funeral
services tomorrow morning for the burial-

01:12:42.176 --> 01:12:44.167
- The funeral.
-...of his brother, Udre...

01:12:44.278 --> 01:12:45.745
who died two days ago-

01:12:45.846 --> 01:12:47.746
He's gonna take Belicoff
at Udre's funeral.

01:12:47.848 --> 01:12:49.816
...some speculation
that Belicoff 's opponent-

01:14:16.537 --> 01:14:19.904
This generator produces
over 3,000 amps-

01:14:20.007 --> 01:14:22.669
much more than is necessary, but...

01:14:22.776 --> 01:14:25.870
I wanted you to understand
the gravity of this situation.

01:14:25.979 --> 01:14:28.709
At 2:30, that radio taped to
your hand will activate.

01:14:28.815 --> 01:14:32.342
You'll have 30 seconds to order
the shooting of your friend Belicoff.

01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:37.115
If you don't,
the generator will start.

01:14:37.224 --> 01:14:40.216
Your skin will melt.
Your blood will vaporize.

01:14:40.327 --> 01:14:42.887
There won't be enough
left of you to identify.

01:14:43.997 --> 01:14:47.433
You have gone to
a great deal of trouble.

01:14:47.534 --> 01:14:49.365
I am just a bureaucrat.

01:14:49.469 --> 01:14:53.269
There is nothing I can do
for you, I'm afraid.

01:14:53.373 --> 01:14:54.362
I disagree.

01:14:54.474 --> 01:14:56.999
This is not a request.

01:14:57.110 --> 01:15:00.978
This situation is fixed,
and you know both possible outcomes.

01:15:01.081 --> 01:15:06.485
Live... or die. Your choice.

01:15:06.587 --> 01:15:10.250
Here's something to keep
things in perspective.

01:15:12.526 --> 01:15:15.154
I picked it up last night
when I was in your house.

01:15:15.262 --> 01:15:17.253
You bastard!

01:15:17.364 --> 01:15:20.891
If I were you,
I'd keep that radio dry.

01:15:22.536 --> 01:15:25.130
Yell all you like.

01:15:25.238 --> 01:15:27.433
The Lord himself won't hear you.

01:15:49.930 --> 01:15:51.921
There are over 100 highly trained...

01:15:52.032 --> 01:15:54.660
alpha Special Forces
soldiers in this cathedral.

01:15:54.768 --> 01:15:57.828
It would be foolish
to attempt any type of violence.

01:15:57.938 --> 01:16:00.668
A man as highly trained
as your assassin would realize this.

01:16:00.774 --> 01:16:03.334
What if he does?
Look around you.

01:16:03.443 --> 01:16:06.276
How much civilian blood
do you think will be shed?

01:16:06.380 --> 01:16:08.871
We are prepared for that as well.

01:16:08.982 --> 01:16:11.109
Gas canisters are being deployed.

01:16:11.218 --> 01:16:14.016
If anything should occur,
the civilians will be rendered unconscious.

01:16:14.121 --> 01:16:16.555
Now, if you will excuse me.

01:17:19.252 --> 01:17:21.880
One minute, 50 seconds.

01:17:30.597 --> 01:17:33.395
My brother- he was a troubled man...

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:35.400
but he was not always like that.

01:17:36.503 --> 01:17:38.698
One minute, 25 seconds.

01:17:41.508 --> 01:17:44.102
One minute, 20 seconds.

01:17:44.211 --> 01:17:48.739
Should we choose to be kind
and let her die much like my brother?

01:17:48.849 --> 01:17:51.113
Or should we do what is necessary...

01:17:51.218 --> 01:17:54.346
what is hard, to save what we love?

01:17:55.756 --> 01:17:58.088
One minute.

01:18:01.394 --> 01:18:04.488
I, for one, will not fail again.

01:18:04.598 --> 01:18:08.261
Not with this country.
Not with our children's future.

01:18:08.368 --> 01:18:10.427
Not with you, my countrymen.

01:18:13.306 --> 01:18:14.933
Thirty-five seconds.

01:18:17.544 --> 01:18:19.774
- Hurry! Come in!
- Da.

01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:22.314
Change target.
Shoot Belicoff.

01:18:23.817 --> 01:18:25.307
It's an impostor! Do it!

01:18:35.962 --> 01:18:39.159
Just fucking do it now!

01:18:59.119 --> 01:19:01.280
Do not let the assassin escape.

01:19:01.388 --> 01:19:03.322
Release the gas.

01:19:03.423 --> 01:19:07.086
Lock down the doors.
I suggest you and your men follow me.

01:19:08.028 --> 01:19:09.757
Let's go!

01:20:13.693 --> 01:20:16.218
Your man has made a mistake.
There is no exit.

01:20:16.329 --> 01:20:18.297
He's trapped.

01:20:21.668 --> 01:20:24.262
Doesn't make sense.

01:20:24.371 --> 01:20:27.033
Why would he-

01:20:32.245 --> 01:20:34.406
"Trust unto God...

01:20:36.483 --> 01:20:38.713
and he shall direct your path."

01:20:38.818 --> 01:20:41.286
Shit. He set this up
from the very beginning.

01:21:35.475 --> 01:21:38.239
Where does this key fit?

01:21:38.345 --> 01:21:41.678
The archbishop's personal chambers.

01:21:41.781 --> 01:21:44.215
The third tower.
Over the Muscova.

01:21:45.719 --> 01:21:47.710
He's going into the river,
like in St. Pete.

01:21:47.821 --> 01:21:50.881
Jenks, get our men.
Let's go.

01:21:54.227 --> 01:21:56.787
He is in the southwest tower.
Call in the gunships.

01:21:56.896 --> 01:21:59.592
Do not let him escape.

01:22:00.834 --> 01:22:02.893
Seems I underestimated you.

01:22:04.104 --> 01:22:06.004
Consistently.

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:09.338
A miscalculation on my part.

01:22:11.978 --> 01:22:13.809
Who are you?

01:22:16.282 --> 01:22:19.410
- Answer me.
- Let me help you.

01:22:19.519 --> 01:22:22.545
- How would you do that? By having me killed?
- Ah. No.

01:22:22.655 --> 01:22:24.885
For that I'm sorry.
It was a mistake.

01:22:24.991 --> 01:22:26.959
And Nika -was that a mistake?

01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:29.392
- Or did you destroy her life
for your own amusement?
- What?

01:22:29.496 --> 01:22:33.193
You think you can take
what has cost millions...

01:22:33.299 --> 01:22:36.200
years of planning,
for the good of this country...

01:22:36.302 --> 01:22:38.202
and destroy that?

01:22:38.304 --> 01:22:41.569
Then what? Walk away?

01:22:41.674 --> 01:22:46.236
You don't really think they will let you do that.
If you kill me, they will never let you go.

01:22:46.346 --> 01:22:49.076
They will hunt you
for the rest of your life.

01:22:58.658 --> 01:23:00.922
You did your job.

01:23:01.027 --> 01:23:04.190
And you did it very well.

01:23:04.297 --> 01:23:07.164
And for that, my boy,
you should be proud.

01:23:08.201 --> 01:23:10.101
That's it?

01:23:10.203 --> 01:23:13.366
Yes. I'm offering you
your life back.

01:23:13.473 --> 01:23:16.601
That is why you are here, yes?
That is what you want.

01:23:16.709 --> 01:23:18.677
Uh-uh.

01:23:18.778 --> 01:23:20.678
No?

01:23:20.780 --> 01:23:21.747
No.

01:24:55.775 --> 01:24:57.800
Interpol! Drop your weapons!

01:24:57.911 --> 01:24:59.845
We have an arrest warrant for that man.

01:25:04.817 --> 01:25:07.445
Don't move! Hands on your head!
On your head!

01:25:07.554 --> 01:25:10.022
- On your knees!
- Don't do anything stupid.

01:25:55.301 --> 01:25:57.326
Just one thing.

01:25:58.438 --> 01:26:01.373
Knowing how this ends,
was it worth it...

01:26:01.474 --> 01:26:03.533
killing Belicoff?

01:26:03.643 --> 01:26:05.440
Knowing how this ends?

01:26:05.545 --> 01:26:07.775
Definitely.

01:26:10.283 --> 01:26:12.183
What do you make of that?

01:26:14.687 --> 01:26:16.086
What the hell?

01:26:34.073 --> 01:26:36.564
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Agent Smith...

01:26:36.676 --> 01:26:39.076
of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.

01:26:39.178 --> 01:26:42.375
- I need all you men to the rear of that vehicle.
- You don't have jurisdiction.

01:26:42.482 --> 01:26:44.848
We aren't here.
Which means when we open up on you...

01:26:44.951 --> 01:26:48.216
and shred your bodies with automatic fire,
then this will never have happened.

01:26:49.756 --> 01:26:51.246
- Stand down.
- We have reason to believe...

01:26:51.357 --> 01:26:53.416
you're involved
in terrorist activities.

01:26:53.526 --> 01:26:56.586
We're Interpol.
And in accordance with section 3-

01:26:56.696 --> 01:27:00.097
- We're transporting an international criminal.
- What criminal?

01:27:00.867 --> 01:27:03.335
Oh, Jesus Christ!

01:27:03.436 --> 01:27:05.427
You know what?
I'm sorry, man.

01:27:07.006 --> 01:27:08.598
My mistake.

01:27:08.708 --> 01:27:11.268
- I thought you were someone else.
- You prick.

01:27:12.979 --> 01:27:14.913
On behalf of the United States government...

01:27:15.014 --> 01:27:18.074
I'd like to extend to you
our sincerest apologies.

01:27:20.086 --> 01:27:21.610
Load up, boys.

01:27:50.350 --> 01:27:53.808
- So now what?
- Now you have to answer my question.

01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:56.718
Are you a good man, Inspector?

01:27:56.823 --> 01:27:59.223
I think.

01:27:59.325 --> 01:28:02.021
And yet you've killed men.

01:28:02.128 --> 01:28:03.527
So, Inspector...

01:28:03.629 --> 01:28:07.224
how does a good man
decide when to kill?

01:28:08.901 --> 01:28:12.132
If I think that a man means
to do me or my family harm...

01:28:12.238 --> 01:28:15.799
then I will do
whatever I can to stop him...

01:28:15.908 --> 01:28:18.502
but beyond that...

01:28:18.611 --> 01:28:20.511
it's a crap-shoot.

01:28:24.584 --> 01:28:26.711
The key.

01:28:26.819 --> 01:28:30.152
You knew I had jurisdiction...

01:28:30.256 --> 01:28:34.022
and would walk you
right out through the front door.

01:28:34.127 --> 01:28:36.061
I wanna be left alone.

01:28:37.797 --> 01:28:40.425
-Just like that?
- Yeah.Just like that.

01:28:46.105 --> 01:28:47.936
This is the man
you've been looking for.

01:28:50.676 --> 01:28:54.237
Ballistics will confirm
he was shot by your weapon.

01:28:54.347 --> 01:28:56.747
The magazine is in the nightstand
next to your bed.

01:28:56.849 --> 01:28:59.079
Don't forget it when
you call your superiors.

01:28:59.185 --> 01:29:01.176
Did you kill him here?

01:29:01.287 --> 01:29:04.484
It's 5:00. If you wait a few hours,
until the girls go to school...

01:29:04.590 --> 01:29:06.490
you won't have to
expose them to this.

01:29:06.592 --> 01:29:08.890
Explains why you waited so long
before you called it in.

01:29:08.995 --> 01:29:11.964
- I can't go along with this.
- I hope you can.

01:29:13.866 --> 01:29:16.130
For both our sakes.

01:29:17.537 --> 01:29:19.505
Good-bye, Michael.

01:29:25.077 --> 01:29:27.045
I hope I never see you again.

01:30:01.414 --> 01:30:04.815
I told you to leave her alone.
You should have listened.

01:30:14.816 --> 01:30:15.817
