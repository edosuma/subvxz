00:58.667 --> 01:02.001
<i>A long, long time ago, the earth was ruled
by dinosaurs.</i>

01:02.042 --> 01:06.126
<i>They were big, so not a lot of people went
around hassling them.</i>

01:06.167 --> 01:10.626
<i>Actually, no people went around hassling
them because there weren't any people yet.</i>

01:10.667 --> 01:12.667
<i>Just the first tiny mammals.</i>

01:14.042 --> 01:16.792
<i>Basically, life was good.</i>

01:16.834 --> 01:21.001
Lou, it just don't get no better
than this.

01:21.042 --> 01:22.459
Yeah!

01:29.542 --> 01:31.417
<i>Then something happened.</i>

01:31.459 --> 01:34.084
<i>A giant meteorite struck the earth.</i>

01:34.126 --> 01:36.251
<i>Goodbye, dinosaurs!</i>

01:38.501 --> 01:41.626
<i>But what if the dinosaurs
weren't all destroyed?</i>

01:41.667 --> 01:44.959
<i>What if the impact of that meteorite
created a parallel dimension</i>

01:45.001 --> 01:47.167
<i>where the dinosaurs continue to thrive</i>

01:47.209 --> 01:50.542
<i>and evolved into intelligent, vicious,
aggressive beings?</i>

01:50.584 --> 01:52.001
<i>Just like us!</i>

01:52.042 --> 01:54.751
<i>And hey, what if they found
their way back?</i>

03:05.251 --> 03:06.959
Hey, lady, what are you...?

03:23.542 --> 03:24.626
Oh!

03:55.917 --> 03:58.876
- Where's the rock?
- Koopa.

04:43.376 --> 04:49.126
<i>Welcome to Miraculous World, where each
week we ask unanswered questions.</i>

04:49.167 --> 04:53.126
<i>Today on our Miraculous World,
another dimension,</i>

04:53.167 --> 04:55.167
<i>- the universe next door.</i>

04:55.209 --> 04:57.792
<i>An alternate world separated
by time and space</i>

04:57.834 --> 05:00.751
<i>and yet somehow joined and
continuous with our own.</i>

05:00.792 --> 05:03.167
Mario Brothers Plumbing.
No leak too small.

05:03.209 --> 05:06.834
A-ha. No, no, no. Don't touch it.

05:06.876 --> 05:10.209
No, it's not a big problem.
Just leave it to the professionals.

05:10.251 --> 05:14.209
<i>- I was somewhere else.
- Another dimension, you mean?</i>

05:14.251 --> 05:15.334
<i>Sure.</i>

05:15.376 --> 05:18.667
- Another dimension...
- OK, we'll be right there.

05:18.709 --> 05:23.376
Luigi, we got a broken dishwasher
at the Riverfront Cafe.

05:23.417 --> 05:25.751
- You know what that means?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:25.792 --> 05:27.167
We got work!

05:27.209 --> 05:29.417
Mario, Mario, right now
on Miraculous World,

05:29.459 --> 05:32.792
this guy just found out he was
in another dimension.

05:32.834 --> 05:36.667
The only thing miraculous I know
is that we're still eating.

05:36.709 --> 05:38.417
While we're going broke.

05:38.459 --> 05:41.667
We ain't goin' broke, Mario.
We're already there.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.334
Yeah?

05:43.376 --> 05:46.292
- Ow!
- Are you spending money on this stuff?

05:46.334 --> 05:47.542
Look at this!

05:47.584 --> 05:50.917
Yeah, but it's got the article about
the missing Brooklyn girls.

05:50.959 --> 05:55.126
Yeah? It's also got one of the scientists
who turns brains into cheese.

05:55.167 --> 05:57.334
Yeah. You don't know. It could happen.

05:57.376 --> 05:59.751
How could that possibly happen?

05:59.792 --> 06:03.251
Anything's possible, Mario.
You just gotta believe.

06:03.292 --> 06:08.667
I do believe. I believe the rent is three
months overdue. That's what I believe.

06:08.709 --> 06:11.917
Hey, turn left here.

06:13.292 --> 06:15.126
Left! I said left!

06:16.292 --> 06:18.209
- What are you doing?
- I don't know, Mario.

06:18.251 --> 06:21.417
Just trust me. I got a good feeling
about this alleyway. I don't know.

06:21.459 --> 06:22.792
What?

06:22.834 --> 06:28.542
My instincts tell me this'll be faster.
Breathe in, big brother. We'll get there.

06:28.584 --> 06:30.417
Luigi!

06:30.459 --> 06:35.209
You know, I read that sea turtles navigate
thousands of miles on instinct.

06:35.251 --> 06:36.959
Not in New York traffic, they don't.

06:37.001 --> 06:40.542
What are you complaining about?
We're here, aren't we?

06:40.584 --> 06:43.584
- You're gettin' worse.
- I'm gettin' worse?

06:43.626 --> 06:45.876
How did we get into sea turtles?

06:47.084 --> 06:49.917
Faster. What did I tell you, huh?

06:49.959 --> 06:51.792
It's a miracle we made it alive.

06:51.834 --> 06:54.709
I thought you didn't believe in miracles,
Mr Tough Guy, huh?

06:56.959 --> 06:59.709
Scapelli. They beat us to it again.

06:59.751 --> 07:01.459
Another lost job.

07:01.501 --> 07:06.251
One of Brooklyn's largest construction
projects has been ordered shut down

07:06.292 --> 07:10.334
as university students continue their
search for dinosaur bones.

07:10.376 --> 07:15.626
Head contractor Anthony Scapelli is now
arriving, hoping to settle the dispute.

07:22.584 --> 07:25.501
Mr Scapelli!

07:31.376 --> 07:33.376
Who's in charge of this hole?

07:33.417 --> 07:35.251
It's him again.

07:37.834 --> 07:39.584
I'm the boss here.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.542
I'm Anthony Scapelli.

07:41.584 --> 07:45.084
I'm the boss elsewhere. My boys need
to get back to work here.

07:45.126 --> 07:47.209
How long you gonna be digging up
these bones?

07:47.251 --> 07:50.126
As long as our court order lasts,
Mr Scapelli.

07:50.167 --> 07:53.876
The university has explained to you
how important this site is.

07:53.917 --> 07:57.584
But we'd be done here a lot sooner if
the goons would stop harassing us.

07:57.626 --> 07:59.626
You look like a smart girl.

07:59.667 --> 08:02.667
I bet you'll be done by tonight.

08:02.709 --> 08:06.542
A lot of girls have been going missing
in Brooklyn recently.

08:06.584 --> 08:09.042
I'd be careful.

08:09.084 --> 08:13.001
James, I'm gonna find a phone and
call the university.

08:13.042 --> 08:14.334
All right.

08:14.376 --> 08:16.751
Keep everyone digging till I get back.

08:35.376 --> 08:40.542
- They say it's dog.
- Don't blow it this time.

08:43.083 --> 08:46.084
There she is.

08:46.126 --> 08:49.251
- Yeah? You sure?
- Two arms, one head, two legs.

08:49.292 --> 08:52.292
Koopa's going to kill us
if we blow it again.

08:52.334 --> 08:53.584
Let's get her.

08:53.626 --> 08:57.542
Luigi, I told you to check the radiator.
Take it easy, will ya?

08:57.584 --> 08:59.917
Relax! It's been making that sound
all week.

08:59.959 --> 09:03.084
Oh, come on, Luigi! You didn't tell me.

09:03.126 --> 09:05.292
Oh man!

09:08.751 --> 09:10.459
Careful, it's hot.

09:10.501 --> 09:12.292
- Careful.
- Woah!

09:14.042 --> 09:15.334
Agh!

09:15.376 --> 09:17.542
I'll do this. Go check for messages.

09:17.584 --> 09:19.501
- See if we got any work.
- All right.

09:39.459 --> 09:42.042
- I missed.
- Nice job.

09:44.792 --> 09:47.792
- Where're you goin'?
- Get some water.

09:55.209 --> 09:59.334
<i>This is AI Bronsky from AI Bronsky's
Department Store.</i>

09:59.376 --> 10:00.959
<i>I have a big flood over here</i>

10:01.001 --> 10:03.126
<i>- so get all your plumbers...
- Thanks.</i>

10:03.167 --> 10:06.167
<i>Get extra plumbers.
Bring every plumber you...</i>

10:06.209 --> 10:09.001
Everybody's got tap water.

10:09.042 --> 10:11.834
Three bucks!

10:11.876 --> 10:13.959
Any jobs?

10:14.001 --> 10:15.209
No.

10:18.667 --> 10:20.459
Thank you.

10:26.209 --> 10:31.834
Hi, it's Daisy. Listen, we're gonna need
more security down here.

10:31.876 --> 10:36.084
I don't care about the money. Scapelli's
down here making threats and I...

10:36.126 --> 10:38.334
She's beautiful, huh?

10:38.376 --> 10:39.417
Who?

10:39.459 --> 10:40.667
Her.

10:44.917 --> 10:47.084
- She's nice. Go talk to her. Go on.
- No, I can't.

10:47.126 --> 10:49.584
- I don't know what to say.
- What's the matter with you?

10:49.626 --> 10:51.334
Fine.

10:51.376 --> 10:53.417
Bye.

11:03.584 --> 11:04.959
Here she comes.

11:05.001 --> 11:07.459
Excuse me. Thank you.

11:07.501 --> 11:09.876
- For letting me use the phone.
- Sure.

11:09.917 --> 11:11.459
And for the quarter.

11:11.501 --> 11:13.417
Are you OK?

11:13.459 --> 11:16.667
I've got a few problems, but...

11:16.709 --> 11:18.876
You know, we got a van.

11:20.334 --> 11:21.626
It's nice.

11:21.667 --> 11:25.334
No, no. I'm asking you if you want a ride.

11:26.959 --> 11:30.376
Oh but... It's broken though.

11:30.417 --> 11:34.542
Well... Your name's
Daisy, isn't it?

11:36.084 --> 11:37.876
I overheard your name was Daisy.

11:37.917 --> 11:40.709
I haven't heard that name around here.
It's really nice too.

11:40.751 --> 11:44.084
No, I have heard it, cos it's like
the flower and everything.

11:44.126 --> 11:47.834
Not that I hang around flower shops
or nothing like that.

11:47.876 --> 11:51.334
What my brother is trying to say is
he doesn't know what to say.

11:51.376 --> 11:55.417
Doesn't even know how to begin
but he has offered you a ride.

11:55.459 --> 11:59.542
And if it would help you out,
please step into the van.

12:02.584 --> 12:04.667
That might not be a bad idea.

12:06.792 --> 12:08.292
OK.

12:08.334 --> 12:09.751
Thanks.

12:09.792 --> 12:12.584
- I thought it was broken.
- I fixed it.

12:27.126 --> 12:30.792
Oh, here. This is as far as we can go.
I'll have to walk the rest of the way.

12:30.834 --> 12:32.667
Wait, wait, wait.

12:32.709 --> 12:35.334
- Ma'am?
- Why, thank you, sir!

12:38.084 --> 12:39.126
Thank you for the ride.

12:39.167 --> 12:40.584
It's a pleasure to meet me.

12:40.626 --> 12:42.751
I mean it's a pleasure to meet you.

12:42.792 --> 12:44.167
Dinner.

12:45.376 --> 12:46.626
Do you eat?

12:46.667 --> 12:48.584
Yeah.

12:48.626 --> 12:49.751
Dinner?

12:49.792 --> 12:51.001
Sure.

12:51.042 --> 12:52.917
- Tonight.
- Tonight?

12:54.501 --> 12:56.959
Oh! OK.

12:57.001 --> 12:58.792
Is six o'clock all right?

12:58.834 --> 12:59.917
Be here.

12:59.959 --> 13:01.209
Great.

13:02.542 --> 13:04.209
Bye.

13:04.251 --> 13:06.667
Bye.

13:06.709 --> 13:09.459
What would you do without
your big brother, huh?

13:09.501 --> 13:11.584
I'd like to give it a shot and find out.

13:11.626 --> 13:13.709
- Come on!
- I was just about to ask her that.

13:13.751 --> 13:16.667
You weren't about to ask her nothing.
You was gonna let her go.

13:16.709 --> 13:19.001
Now she's gonna think
I'm a complete idiot.

13:19.042 --> 13:22.042
Come on. You'll see her tonight.
You impress her with your manners.

13:22.084 --> 13:24.084
Yeah, but why did you tell her
I suck my thumb?

13:29.376 --> 13:32.001
So let me get this perfectly clear here.

13:32.042 --> 13:34.709
What we're discussing is bones.

13:34.751 --> 13:36.501
Not exactly.

13:36.542 --> 13:41.209
OK, so Scapelli blasted through the bones
in the rock and found what?

13:41.251 --> 13:43.334
- Iridium.
- Oh.

13:43.376 --> 13:45.417
That's unbelievable!

13:45.459 --> 13:49.167
It means that a meteorite hit here
a long time ago.

13:49.209 --> 13:55.042
And we think it could be what destroyed
all the dinosaurs.

13:55.084 --> 13:58.001
Wow! There were dinosaurs in Brooklyn?

13:58.042 --> 14:01.292
Relax, Luigi.
There used to be Dodgers here too!

14:01.334 --> 14:04.917
Hey, I got an idea. Why don't you come
down to the tanning salon

14:04.959 --> 14:07.167
and I can hook you up with
some free tans?

14:07.209 --> 14:11.084
Bring a nice bathing suit though,
strapless so you don't get a tan line.

14:11.126 --> 14:13.334
- You probably wanna take off that rock.
- Actually...

14:13.376 --> 14:15.626
I never take it off.

14:16.834 --> 14:21.417
I know it sounds weird, but it's the only
thing I have from when I was found.

14:21.459 --> 14:23.126
Found?

14:23.167 --> 14:24.626
I was abandoned.

14:24.667 --> 14:28.501
I grew up at St Teresa's on
Fulton Street.

14:28.542 --> 14:31.792
You mean you don't know who
your mother and father are neither?

14:31.834 --> 14:34.501
No. What do you mean "neither"?

14:34.542 --> 14:37.209
Cos Mario here brought me up.

14:37.251 --> 14:41.834
- He's been my mother my whole life.
- Hey!

14:41.876 --> 14:46.001
My father. He's been my father, my uncle,
my brother - everybody.

14:54.459 --> 14:56.417
What are you two kids gonna do tonight?

14:58.917 --> 15:01.001
We can take the van back ourselves.

15:02.292 --> 15:05.167
Um... If you're not doing anything
later tonight...

15:05.209 --> 15:07.834
I would like to walk you home.

15:09.626 --> 15:10.792
OK.

15:21.001 --> 15:24.084
Spike! Spike!

15:28.417 --> 15:29.959
- Where you going?
- To get the girl.

15:30.001 --> 15:31.001
That's not the girl.

15:31.042 --> 15:34.042
She's wearing a disguise.
I can spot her a mile away.

15:34.084 --> 15:36.626
Of course she's wearing a disguise.
She thinks she can fool us.

15:38.251 --> 15:39.376
I'm gonna go get her.

15:39.417 --> 15:41.084
- I'm gonna go get her.
- Wait a minute.

15:41.126 --> 15:43.042
We'll follow her and we'll both
go get her.

15:43.084 --> 15:46.126
- Good idea. I bag her, you grab her.
- No, I grab her, you bag her.

15:46.167 --> 15:47.959
- That's what I said.
- Exactly.

15:48.001 --> 15:49.001
This is the one.

15:49.042 --> 15:50.959
That's what you said about
the last four girls.

15:51.001 --> 15:52.542
- I did?
- You did.

15:55.209 --> 15:57.667
I just wanna say one thing first.

15:57.709 --> 16:02.084
I wanna apologise right now in case,
when I start to get talking,

16:02.126 --> 16:04.792
I start to say things that
sound really weird.

16:04.834 --> 16:06.584
Weird?

16:06.626 --> 16:11.292
Look, weird is working in a bone pit
all day and then spending your nights

16:11.334 --> 16:14.376
reading about things that have been dead
for 65 million years.

16:14.417 --> 16:16.376
- That is weird.
- I find it fascinating.

16:16.417 --> 16:19.709
And I mean, you know what?
If you just wanna end this right now...

16:19.751 --> 16:20.876
I would understand.

16:20.917 --> 16:22.667
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

16:22.709 --> 16:26.042
If you wanna end this right now and
you feel bad about that,

16:26.084 --> 16:29.042
but you wanna talk to somebody about it,
you can call me.

16:31.042 --> 16:33.584
You really think what I do is interesting?

16:33.626 --> 16:35.417
I think it's incredible.

16:37.459 --> 16:41.584
Well, you know... If you want...

16:41.626 --> 16:43.292
I could show you.

16:43.334 --> 16:44.751
I'd love you to show me.

16:44.792 --> 16:46.584
Show me.

16:46.626 --> 16:49.626
- See you tomorrow.
- OK. Good night.

16:51.334 --> 16:52.501
Drive carefully.

17:07.666 --> 17:09.584
Mario!

17:11.334 --> 17:13.626
You don't stand a chance.

17:13.666 --> 17:14.876
I won!

17:18.916 --> 17:20.416
That's what you think.

17:20.459 --> 17:23.501
That was sneaky!

17:23.541 --> 17:26.084
We don't even have any security here.

17:26.126 --> 17:28.416
That's what I was calling about
on the phone today.

17:28.459 --> 17:30.876
I can't get the university to give me
any extra money.

17:30.917 --> 17:32.876
Is that why you were talking about
Scapelli?

17:32.917 --> 17:36.376
Yeah. Scapelli was down here with his crew
blasting at the site

17:36.417 --> 17:38.917
and that's when they found the fossils.

17:38.959 --> 17:41.167
Do you know where you're going?

17:41.209 --> 17:42.501
It's just ahead.

17:42.542 --> 17:46.042
What is this? ls this your office or
something? Doesn't it give you the creeps?

17:46.084 --> 17:49.876
Well, it's more like a home. I feel,
I don't know, comfortable down here.

17:49.917 --> 17:51.376
Comfortable? OK.

17:51.417 --> 17:54.417
- Well, this is it.
- Wow!

17:54.459 --> 17:56.167
Have a look.

17:56.209 --> 17:57.751
Awesome!

17:57.792 --> 18:00.251
Oh, check this out.

18:00.292 --> 18:03.042
These are all strange new species.

18:03.084 --> 18:06.626
Look at this one - the way the bones
fit here.

18:06.667 --> 18:08.834
And the opposable thumb -

18:08.876 --> 18:13.126
it's almost as if he was a monster trying
to be a human being.

18:16.376 --> 18:18.251
It's beautiful.

18:23.626 --> 18:25.501
You're beautiful.

18:34.792 --> 18:38.959
- Oh my... Hey!
- Hey, you guys!

18:39.001 --> 18:41.334
- They're Scapelli's.
- Oh no!

18:41.376 --> 18:43.209
What did they do?

18:43.251 --> 18:44.584
What is that down there?

18:44.626 --> 18:48.334
Destroying everything under the sump
pumps. Thank God you're here.

18:48.376 --> 18:49.751
What do you mean?

18:49.792 --> 18:52.667
- You're a plumber, right?
- Oh, yeah.

18:52.709 --> 18:56.167
I know exactly what to do.

18:56.209 --> 18:59.792
- Mario, Scapelli's flooding the site.
- We need your help.

18:59.834 --> 19:01.876
- Scapelli?
- Yeah.

19:03.542 --> 19:07.376
Strap your bone on, kid. We're goin' in.

19:07.417 --> 19:11.834
Scapelli's been trying to force us out
ever since we got here. It's sabotage.

19:11.876 --> 19:13.917
Down here.

19:13.959 --> 19:15.459
Hurry!

19:15.501 --> 19:18.834
- This way.
- Allow me, I'm a professional.

19:18.876 --> 19:21.751
- Looks like a bottom one, right?
- Yeah.

19:27.667 --> 19:30.667
Bottom 116 open-end.

19:30.709 --> 19:32.501
Bottom 116 open-ended.

19:43.959 --> 19:46.459
Wrong again. How many times have
we got this wrong?

19:46.501 --> 19:48.501
You've gotten it wrong five times.

19:48.542 --> 19:51.917
Home for five, home for five.
What percent is that?

19:51.959 --> 19:54.584
I don't know. Let me think.

19:57.376 --> 19:59.876
I don't know, but it's not good.

19:59.917 --> 20:02.876
If we get it wrong one more time,
he's gonna kill us.

20:02.917 --> 20:05.584
He's not gonna kill us.
He's not that nice.

20:07.001 --> 20:08.376
UP ahead!

20:08.417 --> 20:09.959
It's her.

20:10.001 --> 20:11.501
I sense her.

20:11.542 --> 20:13.917
I definitely know it's her.

20:15.876 --> 20:17.792
Basin wrench.

20:19.251 --> 20:21.584
- Basin wrench.
- Great.

20:22.917 --> 20:24.751
Here.

20:24.792 --> 20:26.292
Hand.

20:26.334 --> 20:27.626
Hand.

20:27.667 --> 20:31.084
Now, does this guys know his stuff
or does this guy know his stuff?!

20:31.126 --> 20:32.626
I'm tellin' you.

20:32.667 --> 20:34.917
- OK, you ready?
- Say when.

20:34.959 --> 20:37.251
Let's go... now!

20:38.459 --> 20:41.209
Scapelli's just an amateur.

20:53.126 --> 20:56.751
Daisy? Daisy, where are you?

20:56.792 --> 21:00.084
Daisy! Answer me! Daisy, where are you?

21:00.126 --> 21:01.751
- Let's go this way.
- No, no!

21:01.792 --> 21:04.792
- Let's go this way.
- No, it's this way.

21:04.834 --> 21:06.667
- That's the echo.
- How do you know?

21:06.709 --> 21:09.126
I've been listening to pipes all my life.
Come on.

21:09.167 --> 21:10.876
OK. Daisy!

21:13.167 --> 21:16.834
Luigi, this is a mistake. It's a dead end.
Come on, let's turn back.

21:16.876 --> 21:18.917
- OK, you go back.
- Luigi, please.

21:18.959 --> 21:20.876
Give me the light. Come on,
give me the light.

21:20.917 --> 21:23.959
Daisy!

21:24.001 --> 21:26.792
Luigi, you see how deep that is? Get back.

21:26.834 --> 21:28.209
Agh!

21:28.251 --> 21:29.667
- The light!
- Lean back!

21:29.709 --> 21:33.542
Let it go! Agh, God!

21:33.584 --> 21:37.001
Hold on to me.

21:37.042 --> 21:39.959
Daisy?

21:40.001 --> 21:41.792
Daisy!

21:41.834 --> 21:44.084
Watch it.

21:44.126 --> 21:47.626
Luigi!

21:47.667 --> 21:50.042
Shit!

21:50.084 --> 21:52.917
Help me!

21:54.334 --> 21:57.126
Daisy! ls that you?

21:59.626 --> 22:02.376
Luigi!

22:02.417 --> 22:03.501
No!

22:03.542 --> 22:06.084
- Luigi! Help!
- Daisy!

22:06.126 --> 22:08.917
Get off of me!

22:17.042 --> 22:18.917
Oh!

22:20.792 --> 22:23.417
- Did you see that?
- Yeah. You?

22:23.459 --> 22:25.709
- Yeah.
- Oh!

22:25.751 --> 22:28.626
That's solid rock.

22:30.251 --> 22:32.042
I got a feeling.

22:32.084 --> 22:33.334
Luigi, forget it.

22:33.376 --> 22:34.584
Gotta go with it.

22:34.626 --> 22:36.167
Forget it. It's rock.

22:36.209 --> 22:38.834
Look down there. Luigi!

22:38.876 --> 22:40.834
Luigi!

22:40.876 --> 22:42.501
I don't believe this.

22:50.792 --> 22:52.084
Ugh!

22:56.084 --> 22:57.209
Er...

22:59.542 --> 23:02.459
Ash! Agh!

23:19.459 --> 23:20.959
Mario!

23:21.001 --> 23:23.876
I disintegrated. Am I still here?

23:23.917 --> 23:26.209
What is this place?

23:26.251 --> 23:27.792
There she is. Come on!
Hurry up. Run.

23:27.834 --> 23:29.376
Where are you taking me?

23:29.417 --> 23:32.001
Back to where you belong.

23:32.042 --> 23:34.126
- You're hurting me!
- I'm gonna kill 'em.

23:34.167 --> 23:36.959
No, you're not gonna kill 'em.
Not if I get there first.

23:37.001 --> 23:39.126
I'm gonna break every bone in their body.

23:39.167 --> 23:41.792
Then I'm gonna kill 'em.
I'm really gonna kill 'em.

23:46.417 --> 23:49.084
I- Help me!
- Daisy! I'm coming!

23:49.126 --> 23:51.959
- Get off of me!
- Excuse me.

23:52.001 --> 23:54.251
You better not hurt her.

23:58.042 --> 24:01.917
Excuse me. Sorry, excuse me.

24:04.167 --> 24:07.834
<i>Shuttle to Koopa Union is cancelled.
Passengers transferring to the Square...</i>

24:07.876 --> 24:09.584
Get outta my way!

24:29.334 --> 24:31.834
Where the hell are we?

24:31.876 --> 24:36.376
This is crazy. We're under the river,
but this can't be Manhattan.

24:36.417 --> 24:37.917
Where is this place?

24:37.959 --> 24:41.042
I don't know. I ain't been to
Manhattan in a couple of weeks.

24:41.084 --> 24:43.084
Must've been a bad couple of weeks.

24:43.126 --> 24:45.167
No!

24:45.209 --> 24:48.001
There she is! Daisy!

24:48.042 --> 24:49.667
Luigi?

24:49.709 --> 24:50.917
Daisy!

24:50.959 --> 24:52.209
Luigi!

24:52.251 --> 24:54.417
- Mario!
- We're coming.

24:54.459 --> 24:58.126
You better not hurt her. Come on,
somebody, do something.

24:58.167 --> 24:59.334
Somebody stop her!

24:59.376 --> 25:02.417
- Daisy!
- Are you a cop, or what?

25:02.459 --> 25:04.126
Move on. Come on, let's go.

25:06.917 --> 25:08.917
Agh!

25:12.376 --> 25:13.917
Are you OK?

25:13.959 --> 25:16.251
I'm OK, yeah. You're the one without
the padding.

25:16.292 --> 25:18.334
Yeah, well, you're the old one.

25:20.834 --> 25:23.209
- Oh, my God! Look at that.
- Watch out!

25:23.251 --> 25:25.376
Ugh! Let's go.

25:27.876 --> 25:29.584
Excuse me.

25:29.626 --> 25:33.084
It's all sticky. Yuck!

25:35.917 --> 25:38.334
Smell this! Smells really good!

25:38.376 --> 25:42.584
Get away from my baby!
Get away from my baby!

25:42.626 --> 25:44.917
- What is this place?
- I don't know.

25:44.959 --> 25:46.001
This is crazy.

25:48.167 --> 25:49.334
Where are we?

25:49.376 --> 25:52.042
I don't know. Maybe we got knocked
unconscious for 100 years

25:52.084 --> 25:53.834
and woke up in Manhattan of the future.

25:53.876 --> 25:55.584
Maybe the Bronx of today.

25:55.626 --> 25:58.376
No wonder they tell you never
to come up here.

25:58.417 --> 25:59.667
Mario, I got a feeling.

25:59.709 --> 26:02.042
I got a feeling we're not in Brooklyn
no more.

26:02.084 --> 26:03.751
Where you goin'? Hey!

26:08.542 --> 26:13.792
Look at this place. Pathetic!
It gets worse every day.

26:13.834 --> 26:15.042
It's disgusting.

26:15.084 --> 26:18.501
The humans on the other side have
a world full of resources.

26:18.542 --> 26:20.376
- Ready for the taking.
- I know.

26:20.417 --> 26:26.001
Imagine it. An endless supply of food,
clean air, water.

26:26.042 --> 26:28.001
And what are we stuck with?

26:28.042 --> 26:29.917
This...

26:29.959 --> 26:34.001
pit hole of germs everywhere, fungus.

26:35.376 --> 26:41.584
65 million years we've been exiled here
after the meteorite struck.

26:43.292 --> 26:46.917
While mammals roam free
in the other dimension.

26:46.959 --> 26:50.084
Well, not for long.

26:51.501 --> 26:54.042
When you get your rock.

26:54.084 --> 26:55.959
When I get the princess.

26:56.001 --> 26:57.376
Princess?

26:57.417 --> 27:01.542
I need the rock, and the Princess Daisy

27:01.584 --> 27:04.626
and I'll finally be able to merge
our world with theirs

27:04.667 --> 27:06.542
and get rid of the mammals.

27:06.584 --> 27:10.167
It's everything you've hoped for,
everything you've worked for.

27:12.334 --> 27:14.792
- Excuse me, cousin.
- Hello, morons.

27:14.834 --> 27:16.334
- Hello!
- Hello!

27:16.376 --> 27:18.292
I captured the princess.

27:18.334 --> 27:20.001
She's being defungussed.

27:20.042 --> 27:23.084
- But I took her through the gateway.
- I recognised her.

27:23.126 --> 27:26.126
He couldn't tell one mammal from another.

27:26.167 --> 27:30.251
Good. Now, where's the rock?

27:33.792 --> 27:35.292
- Rock, sir?
- Rock?

27:35.334 --> 27:38.501
The meteorite piece that she wears
around her neck

27:38.542 --> 27:40.209
and I told you not to forget it.

27:40.251 --> 27:43.376
- That rock!
- I told you not to forget it.

27:43.417 --> 27:46.376
And I told you to remind him.

27:46.417 --> 27:49.501
Without that piece the meteorite
lays dormant.

27:49.542 --> 27:52.084
I'll not be able to merge the dimensions.

27:52.126 --> 27:53.501
Where is it?

27:55.709 --> 27:57.209
The plumbers took it.

27:57.251 --> 27:59.834
Plumbers?

27:59.876 --> 28:02.334
Plumber alert.

28:02.376 --> 28:05.334
Plumber alert.

28:05.376 --> 28:09.709
<i>That's right. The Koopa man is looking
for a couple of plumbers.</i>

28:09.751 --> 28:13.626
<i>And there's a big coin reward.
2,000 gold Koopa coins.</i>

28:13.667 --> 28:16.292
<i>Guess he must have a serious
plumbing problem.</i>

28:19.751 --> 28:22.417
20 Koopons, spiny burger here.

28:24.542 --> 28:27.917
Fried tweeter, only 20 Koopons.
You like little wigglers? 15.

28:27.959 --> 28:31.459
Hey, listen, if we're gonna eat in this
place we're gonna have to be very hungry.

28:31.501 --> 28:33.834
Excuse me, lady, can you tell me
where I am?

28:33.876 --> 28:37.584
- Yeah, you're in my way, egg suckers!
- Who are these people?

28:37.626 --> 28:42.001
- Are you boys new here in town?
- Lady, we're looking for somebody.

28:42.042 --> 28:43.834
- We're from Brooklyn.
- Yeah.

28:43.876 --> 28:46.251
You know, it's very dangerous
in this neighbourhood.

28:46.292 --> 28:48.501
You shouldn't wander around
without a weapon.

28:48.542 --> 28:49.626
Yeah.

28:49.667 --> 28:51.001
You got one?

28:51.042 --> 28:52.417
No.

28:52.459 --> 28:53.834
All right.

28:53.876 --> 28:57.334
Get 'em up, suckers! Koopa coins.

28:57.376 --> 29:00.542
I need Koopa coins, you lame-os.

29:02.042 --> 29:04.959
- Well, this outta do it.
- Don't, don't touch that!

29:05.001 --> 29:08.084
- Just fine.
- That's not even ours.

29:08.126 --> 29:09.501
Hey!

29:09.542 --> 29:11.709
Let me go!

29:11.751 --> 29:13.792
Where're you...? Put me down!

29:24.542 --> 29:26.001
Rats!

29:35.792 --> 29:38.584
You wanna give us the rock back, lady?

29:38.626 --> 29:41.584
Come and get it, big boy.

30:11.126 --> 30:12.501
Hey! Hey, guys-

30:12.542 --> 30:15.917
Cheer up! Things could get worse.

30:15.959 --> 30:18.917
♪ Ain't got no water anywhere

30:18.959 --> 30:22.917
♪ Food's scarce, so's the air

30:22.959 --> 30:27.001
♪ Got no resources, in a great big stupor

30:27.042 --> 30:31.167
♪ All because of the evil King Koopa ♪

30:32.959 --> 30:35.334
- Agh!
- You know the law, Toad.

30:35.376 --> 30:38.334
Hey, wait a minute. You can't arrest
a guy for just singing a song.

30:38.376 --> 30:40.834
For anti-Koopa songs we can.

30:40.876 --> 30:43.959
Aha! Plumbers!

30:44.001 --> 30:45.501
No, he is. I'm just apprenticing.

30:45.542 --> 30:47.417
- Get in the car.
- But I didn't do anything.

30:47.459 --> 30:50.001
Are you telling us you can arrest
a guy for being a plumber?

30:50.042 --> 30:52.251
- Get outta here!
- Get in there, plumber!

30:52.292 --> 30:55.459
- Hey, what is this?
- What did we do?

30:55.501 --> 30:57.459
I'm getting arrested for
being a plumber.

30:57.501 --> 30:59.626
Write his number down.

31:02.792 --> 31:06.251
- Stop pushing me!
- Ls that Daisy?

31:06.292 --> 31:08.001
- Daisy!
- Daniella?

31:08.042 --> 31:09.376
Daisy, you too!

31:09.417 --> 31:11.042
- Daniella!
- Daisy!

31:11.084 --> 31:12.709
- Are you OK?
- What's going on?

31:12.751 --> 31:15.001
I don't really know.

31:15.042 --> 31:18.417
There's this guy, his name is Koopa,
and he's looking for this princess.

31:18.459 --> 31:20.501
I guess none of us here fit the bill.

31:20.542 --> 31:23.459
You boys ain't from around here, are ya?

31:23.501 --> 31:24.667
Brooklyn.

31:24.709 --> 31:27.834
Whoa!

31:42.459 --> 31:46.084
Hey! What are you doing?

31:48.542 --> 31:50.626
Don't we get a phone call?

31:52.834 --> 31:54.584
- Name?
- Mario.

31:54.626 --> 31:56.126
Last name.

31:56.167 --> 31:57.626
Mario.

31:57.667 --> 32:00.167
- OK, what's your name?
- Luigi.

32:00.209 --> 32:01.626
Luigi Luigi?

32:01.667 --> 32:03.501
No. Luigi Mario.

32:03.542 --> 32:07.042
OK, look, how many Marios are there
between the two of you?

32:07.084 --> 32:10.626
There's three. There's Mario Mario and
Luigi Mario.

32:10.667 --> 32:12.376
Mike. Mike!

32:12.417 --> 32:14.334
Help these Marios around the side.

32:15.959 --> 32:17.792
Stop pushing me around.

32:17.834 --> 32:20.876
- Prepare to be defungussed.
- I'm not going in there.

32:20.917 --> 32:22.459
Agh!

32:22.501 --> 32:25.001
Hold still.

32:25.042 --> 32:26.876
It's cold! Agh!

32:26.917 --> 32:29.667
What is this?

32:36.334 --> 32:38.751
Let's go. Move it! Come on!

32:38.792 --> 32:40.126
That way. Let's go.

32:40.167 --> 32:42.001
What was that?

32:42.042 --> 32:44.959
The fungus unit. The fungus is choking
the city.

32:45.001 --> 32:47.001
Move! Move!

32:47.042 --> 32:50.042
OK, through the gate, through the gate.

32:50.084 --> 32:52.126
Move it! Go! Go!

32:53.417 --> 32:55.542
Come on! Come on!

32:57.167 --> 32:59.751
Hey, Mario, look! I grew an inch.

33:02.501 --> 33:04.792
What's that?

33:06.251 --> 33:10.584
What's that red...? Oh my God!
Oh no!

33:15.459 --> 33:16.542
Oh no!

33:16.584 --> 33:18.542
- Agh!
- Agh!

33:22.792 --> 33:24.626

33:39.334 --> 33:42.376
What's another word that rhymes

33:42.417 --> 33:44.459
Yeah, tension, and I'm full of it,
so shut up.

33:44.501 --> 33:47.501
Wait a minute. What did you mean
"another dimension"?

33:47.542 --> 33:50.584
Did you mean our worlds have
crossed over or something like that?

33:50.626 --> 33:53.667
Sure, kid. You know, according to history,
a long time ago,

33:53.709 --> 33:58.084
big meteorite came, blasted our universes
into parallel dimensions.

33:58.126 --> 34:03.501
You know what else I think? All that
fungus out there, that's our old king.

34:03.542 --> 34:07.001
It's true. He's been de-evolved.

34:07.042 --> 34:09.792
That's right. He's been de-evolved
into fungus

34:09.833 --> 34:12.126
and now he's wreaking his revenge
on the city.

34:12.167 --> 34:14.251
- Mario Brothers.
- Yeah, that's us.

34:14.292 --> 34:17.458
You better get a lawyer and
get us out of this chicken coop.

34:17.501 --> 34:18.751
Yeah, me too!

34:18.792 --> 34:20.292
You got one.

34:21.917 --> 34:23.417
I got 'em. Let's go. Come on.

34:23.458 --> 34:25.292
- Just let me do it.
- Shut up!

34:29.126 --> 34:33.458
Boys! Boys! Sit down.

34:33.501 --> 34:35.042
How's prison?

34:38.751 --> 34:41.126
You look like hell.

34:41.167 --> 34:47.792
I'm... Larry Lazard
of Lazard, Lazard,

34:47.833 --> 34:51.333
Conda, Dactyl and Cohen.

34:51.376 --> 34:53.376
Who sent you?

34:53.417 --> 34:54.876
Are you from the city?

34:54.917 --> 34:57.501
No, I'm from that little part of all of us

34:57.542 --> 35:01.126
that can't stand to see someone else
in need or in pain.

35:01.167 --> 35:04.667
I bet. Who's this Koopa clown?

35:04.709 --> 35:07.751
We gotta talk to that goofball now.

35:07.792 --> 35:10.292
I don't think you wanna do that.

35:10.334 --> 35:12.126
- Why?
- Why not?

35:12.167 --> 35:16.042
- That Koopa clown...
- Yeah?

35:17.542 --> 35:22.042
Is one evil, egg-sucking
son of a snake.

35:23.959 --> 35:29.251
Now... where is that
meteorite piece?

35:32.084 --> 35:33.834
The what?

35:44.001 --> 35:45.834
You know what I'm talking about!

35:47.834 --> 35:50.834
- Agh!
- No-one touches President Koopa.

35:53.334 --> 35:56.126
You're Koopa? You just said you were
one evil...

35:56.167 --> 35:58.959
One evil egg-sucking son of a snake.

36:00.042 --> 36:01.792
Did I lie?

36:01.834 --> 36:04.751
Take these two plumbers

36:04.792 --> 36:07.751
to the devo chamber.

36:07.792 --> 36:10.209
- I'm all right.
- Come on.

36:15.209 --> 36:16.834
What a lousy chamber.

36:16.876 --> 36:18.792
Ever since Koopa took over.

36:18.834 --> 36:21.417
And you, Koopa!

36:21.459 --> 36:23.417
You're a lousy leader.

36:23.459 --> 36:27.709
One thing I cannot stand is naysay.

36:27.751 --> 36:31.917
Simon, de-evolve him now.

36:31.959 --> 36:33.667
De-evolve!

36:34.751 --> 36:36.542
<i>Cretaceous.</i>

36:36.584 --> 36:40.917
Our old king - you tried to get rid of
him, but the king is everywhere.

36:40.959 --> 36:44.376
- You can't get rid of him.
- See you later, alligator.

36:44.417 --> 36:46.417
Ever!

36:49.459 --> 36:54.334
You may think of evolution as
an upward process.

36:54.376 --> 36:57.709
Things evolve from primeval slime,

36:57.751 --> 37:00.542
up to single-cell organisms,

37:00.584 --> 37:04.459
up to intelligent life.

37:04.501 --> 37:08.667
De-evolution, of course,
works the opposite way.

37:08.709 --> 37:11.042
Back to simpler forms,

37:11.084 --> 37:17.167
for instance, even our musical friend
Toad can become...

37:17.209 --> 37:21.001
a loyal child of the royal family.

37:21.042 --> 37:23.834
Goombas.

37:27.751 --> 37:31.001
- Why d'you do that to him?
- No, no.

37:31.042 --> 37:33.209
Not now.

37:35.167 --> 37:38.251
What single-cell organism did you
evolve from?

37:38.292 --> 37:42.917
Tyrannosaurus Rex, the lizard king,
thank you very much.

37:44.209 --> 37:49.501
Goomba! Whereas my evolution was
wonderful and sweet,

37:49.542 --> 37:53.251
your de-evolution will be
a living nightmare

37:53.292 --> 37:55.709
if you don't tell me where
that meteorite piece is.

37:57.751 --> 38:00.292
- That's Toad?
- Yes.

38:00.334 --> 38:03.626
Loyal, lethal...

38:06.334 --> 38:08.126
stupid.

38:08.167 --> 38:08.667
Goomba!

38:12.667 --> 38:15.417
Walk tall! Be proud!

38:15.459 --> 38:17.834
Go, Goomba!

38:17.876 --> 38:20.292
Join the goombas!

38:27.751 --> 38:30.209
Agh!

38:32.876 --> 38:35.834
Guards! Guards! Arrest these plumbers.

38:37.167 --> 38:38.417
<i>De-evolve Jurassic.</i>

38:38.459 --> 38:42.126
You're going back where
you belong, lizard.

38:42.167 --> 38:44.292
Help me! Help me!

38:44.334 --> 38:46.209
Keep going. Got it.

38:46.251 --> 38:49.917
Yeah! Let's get outta here.

38:55.126 --> 38:58.292
I'll kill that plumber!

39:03.084 --> 39:05.834
We're back at the police station.

39:09.709 --> 39:14.376
Hey, Mario, look at this. These little
mushroom things on the fungus.

39:14.417 --> 39:17.167
Great. A building with athlete's foot!

39:20.876 --> 39:23.917
Hey, look at that. What is that?

39:23.959 --> 39:26.334
Goombas. Come on, let's go!

39:26.376 --> 39:28.251
Look, he was trying to give us that thing.

39:30.459 --> 39:32.667
Swing! Keep swingin'.

39:32.709 --> 39:34.459
I'm swingin', I'm swingin'!

39:34.501 --> 39:36.376
Just keep hanging. Close your eyes.

39:36.417 --> 39:37.959
Hey! Look at these dudes.

39:38.001 --> 39:40.167
Yee-ha! Whoo!

39:40.209 --> 39:41.376
Hang on.

39:41.417 --> 39:45.709
Hey, man, this is fun!

39:50.751 --> 39:52.376
- What was that?
- Get ready.

39:52.417 --> 39:54.667
- You ready?
- I'm ready, I'm ready.

39:54.709 --> 39:56.334
Whoo!

39:56.376 --> 39:57.709
Yeah, yeah!

40:03.209 --> 40:05.417
Let go! Now!

40:05.459 --> 40:08.042
Right. Which door?

40:08.084 --> 40:10.084
My instinct tells me this one.

40:10.126 --> 40:12.292
Let's go in this one.

40:14.667 --> 40:16.709
- Come on.
- I'm coming.

40:16.751 --> 40:18.917
Here we are.

40:20.501 --> 40:22.959
They got us. What are we gonna do?

40:23.001 --> 40:25.501
Number one - we steal this car.

40:25.542 --> 40:27.376
Number two - I'm driving.

40:27.417 --> 40:29.584
- All right, whatever.
- Come on!

40:32.042 --> 40:34.209
Wait for me. Don't take off.

40:35.667 --> 40:38.209
- OK.
- Let's see what I got over here.

40:38.251 --> 40:41.001
Where's the starter on this thing?

40:41.042 --> 40:42.834
I got a feeling about this, Marioroni.

40:42.876 --> 40:44.459
I don't believe you can do that.

40:44.501 --> 40:47.709
Comes from sitting on my butt all day
playing video games, that's why.

40:49.292 --> 40:51.376
- Got it.
- Let's get outta here.

40:51.417 --> 40:54.042
Let's hit the bricks.

41:03.251 --> 41:05.167
Hey!

41:18.459 --> 41:21.917
<i>Security alert. Stand by
for special bulletin.</i>

41:21.959 --> 41:24.334
Mario, look!

41:25.709 --> 41:26.917
You look terrible.

41:26.959 --> 41:28.626
You don't look so good yourself.

41:28.667 --> 41:31.417
<i>Alien species escaping from police
detention...</i>

41:31.459 --> 41:33.584
Aliens? We gotta deal with
aliens too?

41:33.626 --> 41:35.709
Luigi, we're the aliens!

41:35.751 --> 41:38.542
We are? Whoa! Cool!

41:51.167 --> 41:53.167
Hey, Mario, you're going the wrong way.

41:53.209 --> 41:55.667
- How would you know?
- Trust me.

41:57.542 --> 41:59.751
You're driving like a maniac.
Would you watch it?

41:59.792 --> 42:01.417
You wanna drive?

42:04.751 --> 42:07.292
- I'm not riding with you any more.
- OK, you drive.

42:07.334 --> 42:08.917
No! What are you doin'?

42:13.626 --> 42:15.917
- How are you steering this?
- I'm not.

42:24.167 --> 42:26.417
I hope the guy downstairs knows
where we're going.

42:34.167 --> 42:36.626
Hey-hey! This is driving!

42:37.959 --> 42:39.959
Cool, man!

42:48.917 --> 42:50.792
Brace yourself!

43:07.459 --> 43:09.584
Glug-glug-glug-glug!

43:13.584 --> 43:16.042
Which way?

43:16.084 --> 43:18.084
- Take the Parkway.
- Right.

43:22.709 --> 43:24.667
Perfect, perfect!

43:24.709 --> 43:26.542
- You said the Parkway.
- I know.

43:26.584 --> 43:28.709
But I wanted the tunnel so I said Parkway

43:28.751 --> 43:30.751
cos I knew you'd go the opposite
way I suggested.

43:43.292 --> 43:46.167
Hey, watch it! What are you doin'?

43:46.209 --> 43:48.376
<i>Warning - leaving power grid.
Powering down.</i>

43:48.417 --> 43:50.292
I can't stop this thing.

43:50.334 --> 43:52.876
- I can't see where I'm going.
- Look out, Mario!

43:52.917 --> 43:55.917
- Use the brakes.
- There are no brakes.

43:55.959 --> 43:59.001
- Do something!
- This fungus is going to kill us!

43:59.042 --> 44:01.459
We're gonna hit the end of the tunnel!

44:21.292 --> 44:25.334
Hey, was that superior driving skills
or what?

44:25.376 --> 44:29.042
Let's get outta here before this fungus
stuff eats us alive.

44:29.084 --> 44:31.459
The fungus just saved us.

44:31.501 --> 44:34.126
What are you talking about?
It was my driving that saved us.

44:34.167 --> 44:37.334
It wasn't your driving.
The tunnel just sneezed us out

44:37.376 --> 44:40.209
and this giant bogey caught us.
That's what saved us.

44:40.251 --> 44:43.626
Ah! Come on! Let's get outta here.

44:46.542 --> 44:48.417
Excuse, sir! Excuse me, sir.

44:48.459 --> 44:49.459
Sorry?

44:49.501 --> 44:51.209
Sir?

44:51.251 --> 44:54.542
I'm sorry, we didn't meant to disturb you

44:54.584 --> 44:58.001
but the plumbers are in the tunnel.
They're on their way to the desert.

44:58.042 --> 45:02.709
What are you doing here instead of being
in the desert heading them off?

45:02.751 --> 45:06.084
That's exactly what I told him, sir.
Exactly what I told him.

45:06.126 --> 45:09.792
Between you and me, Spike hasn't got
a thought in his brain.

45:09.834 --> 45:12.209
Ah! Ah! He's a liar, sir.

45:12.251 --> 45:15.626
Between us, Iggy doesn't have a brain
in his head.

45:15.667 --> 45:17.084
I agree.

45:17.126 --> 45:18.417
They're your relatives.

45:18.459 --> 45:19.709
Wait outside.

45:19.751 --> 45:21.417
We'll wait outside.

45:21.459 --> 45:26.042
Lena, bring me the princess
and have her cleaned up.

45:26.084 --> 45:29.459
Do you know what I love about mud?

45:30.917 --> 45:34.126
It's clean and it's dirty
at the same time.

45:38.167 --> 45:40.251
The princess.

45:56.626 --> 45:59.167
Are you here to help us?

46:00.626 --> 46:01.959
Hardly.

46:04.501 --> 46:10.084
Now let me guess which
one of you is Daisy.

46:15.292 --> 46:18.084
Princess Daisy.

46:19.917 --> 46:21.376
- Princess?
- What?

46:24.292 --> 46:28.126
- Princess Daisy?
- This is gettin' weird.

46:28.167 --> 46:32.334
Oh. You have your mother's eyes.

46:36.876 --> 46:38.834
Come with me.

46:48.501 --> 46:51.667
Goodbye, Spike. I'm gonna miss ya.

46:53.042 --> 46:56.126
Have a nice trip. See you next Fall.

46:56.167 --> 46:59.126
<i>Evolve.</i>

46:59.167 --> 47:01.126
<i>Advanced.</i>

47:03.334 --> 47:07.959
Good choice, cousin. I always thought
he'd make a great goomba.

47:12.584 --> 47:14.584
Bye. Spike.

47:27.501 --> 47:30.501
Ah! It's our benevolent dictator.

47:30.542 --> 47:32.334
As it were.

47:34.584 --> 47:39.001
Ignatius, do you know what the square root
of 26,481 is?

47:39.042 --> 47:40.667
What are you talking about?

47:40.709 --> 47:42.001
191.

47:42.042 --> 47:43.876
What are you doing? Not me!

47:43.917 --> 47:45.876
Not me, cousin, not me!

47:45.917 --> 47:47.501
Spike! Help me, Spike!

47:49.042 --> 47:53.542
Perhaps if I could just make you idiots
smarter, you won't screw up this time.

47:53.584 --> 47:55.501
Please! Not me, cous, no!

48:00.167 --> 48:01.584
Oh my!

48:04.584 --> 48:06.251
How peculiar!

48:06.292 --> 48:09.709
Quite an agreeable transmogrification.

48:09.751 --> 48:12.584
More like a transfiguration.

48:12.626 --> 48:14.584
- Ah! A super metamorphosis.
- Mm.

48:14.626 --> 48:18.251
Enough! Both of you, go to the desert.

48:18.292 --> 48:21.209
Excuse me, excuse me,
that hardly seems logical.

48:21.251 --> 48:23.751
Perhaps we should stay and
formulate our own strategy.

48:23.792 --> 48:26.709
Téte a téte, inner circle,
that sort of thing.

48:26.751 --> 48:29.167
Here's what's logical to me.

48:30.334 --> 48:34.584
If you do not return with the plumbers
and the rock...

48:36.709 --> 48:39.876
l shall personally kill you.

48:41.751 --> 48:43.792
- We're going.
- After you, Ignatius.

48:53.542 --> 48:55.667
It was your mother's.

48:55.709 --> 48:58.792
What do you know about my mother?

48:58.834 --> 49:01.626
She was quite an inspiration.

49:01.667 --> 49:03.334
To some.

49:03.376 --> 49:08.626
When Koopa took over, she stole the rock
and smuggled you to the other side.

49:08.667 --> 49:10.417
Then she died.

49:12.834 --> 49:14.876
What about my father? ls he alive?

49:14.917 --> 49:17.542
It depends on what you mean by living.

49:17.584 --> 49:19.209
What are you talking about?

49:19.251 --> 49:20.459
Listen to me.

49:20.501 --> 49:23.459
I don't care whose daughter you are.

49:25.001 --> 49:28.417
Koopa thinks you're the only one who can
merge the dimensions.

49:28.459 --> 49:32.334
I have waited too long to let all this
slip away.

49:43.792 --> 49:45.584
You said the tunnel.

49:45.626 --> 49:47.042
I did not. I said Parkway.

49:47.084 --> 49:48.709
But you meant the tunnel.

49:48.751 --> 49:51.459
Go on, pick a direction.
Any direction you like.

49:52.667 --> 49:57.126
That looks good, I'll go there.
That's it - let's die there.

49:57.167 --> 50:00.876
Are the goombas training with
the hand-held de-evolution gun?

50:00.917 --> 50:02.584
As we speak, sir.

50:02.626 --> 50:03.917
Excellent.

50:03.959 --> 50:09.209
After the merge, it will be nice to see
the humans de-evolve, won't it?

50:09.251 --> 50:12.542
What is it that they come from?
I keep forgetting.

50:12.584 --> 50:16.334
- It's mice or something.
- Apes, sir, monkeys.

50:16.376 --> 50:19.792
Disgusting mammals! Pah!

50:21.667 --> 50:23.959
Your princess is here.

50:24.001 --> 50:28.334
My, my. Looks like you got up on the wrong
side of the nest this morning.

51:21.584 --> 51:23.584
- You're a...
- Go ahead and say it.

51:25.126 --> 51:27.167
Dinosaur.

51:29.209 --> 51:32.709
Yoshi is a pet of the royal family.
You may pet him.

51:32.751 --> 51:37.626
Just don't move your hands around
like a small wounded animal.

51:39.209 --> 51:42.792
You must be the great Koopa.

51:42.834 --> 51:44.417
That I am.

51:44.459 --> 51:47.709
Ruler of all that you see.

51:47.751 --> 51:53.542
A few miserable streets
and endless desert.

51:55.667 --> 51:57.959
You've done a lovely job.

51:59.251 --> 52:00.417
Well...

52:01.959 --> 52:03.459
thank you.

52:05.876 --> 52:07.667
Where's my father?

52:10.834 --> 52:12.626
Ah!

52:12.667 --> 52:14.584
Mm.

52:14.626 --> 52:17.251
He's around.

52:19.459 --> 52:22.417
You're so fresh.

52:22.459 --> 52:24.167
And so clean.

52:27.376 --> 52:29.626
Don't fight it.

52:29.667 --> 52:33.876
You know you've always been uncomfortable
in the human world.

52:33.917 --> 52:37.376
You've at least suspected that you were...

52:39.334 --> 52:40.626
different.

52:40.667 --> 52:44.376
I have suspected a lot of things
but not that I...

52:44.417 --> 52:47.917
That you descended from
the dinosaurs.

52:47.959 --> 52:52.626
And you know what they say
about little girls, don't you?

52:52.667 --> 52:55.084
- No.
- Mm?

52:55.126 --> 52:57.251
They say...

52:57.292 --> 53:02.126
they never forget the first time
they're kissed by a lizard.

53:02.167 --> 53:04.584
Agh!

53:06.876 --> 53:08.292
Take her away.

53:08.334 --> 53:13.292
I'll need to... use her later.

53:17.542 --> 53:19.792
Throwback!

53:28.584 --> 53:30.376
Plumbers!

53:30.417 --> 53:31.959
Affirmative!

53:32.001 --> 53:33.751
Come, come, quickly!

53:33.792 --> 53:37.917
- Quickly, after them, cousin!
- I'm with you, cousin!

53:37.959 --> 53:41.376
Go forward!

53:41.417 --> 53:44.292
That way, cous.

53:46.251 --> 53:51.126
Go right, go right! Agh!

53:56.209 --> 53:58.542
Ah! Ah! In the name of King Koopa...

53:58.584 --> 53:59.584
We arrest you.

53:59.626 --> 54:00.917
Surrender immediately.

54:02.459 --> 54:06.542
If you two don't start talking, we're
gonna leave you to these guys for lunch.

54:06.584 --> 54:09.084
Now, where's Daisy?

54:09.126 --> 54:11.501
No, no, no. Where's the rock, scallywag?

54:11.542 --> 54:13.292
Where's Daisy, butt-breath?

54:13.334 --> 54:15.209
Where's the rock, over-weaning rogue?

54:15.251 --> 54:17.251
Not until you give us Daisy,
biscuit-head.

54:17.292 --> 54:19.501
- Where's the rock?
- Shut up!

54:21.751 --> 54:25.209
Now... what's with this rock?

54:25.251 --> 54:27.459
The rock is a piece of a special meteorite

54:27.501 --> 54:30.584
which was chipped off upon impact
65 million years ago.

54:30.626 --> 54:33.459
Yes, you see once this rock is reinserted
into the meteorite,

54:33.501 --> 54:36.167
our two dimensions will reunite
and we will become one.

54:36.209 --> 54:39.667
Then our cousin Koopa shall become ruler
of both our worlds.

54:39.709 --> 54:40.876
I don't get it.

54:40.917 --> 54:43.417
Why didn't he just come through before
like you clowns?

54:43.459 --> 54:45.876
You fool! It's been sealed off for years

54:45.917 --> 54:48.334
until someone on your side blasted it
open again.

54:50.584 --> 54:52.084
Scapelli.

54:52.126 --> 54:55.167
What if we get you the rock?
Will you get us Daisy?

54:56.709 --> 54:57.834
Yeah, yeah.

54:57.876 --> 55:02.042
Yes, I think that proposal would mutually
benefit both our parties.

55:02.084 --> 55:04.042
Yes, OK, now hand over the rock.

55:04.084 --> 55:05.376
Someone took it.

55:05.417 --> 55:08.751
By the bar. That lady with the red spikes
who mugged us...

55:08.792 --> 55:12.459
- Was she corpulent? Very corpulent?
- No, she was just really round.

55:12.501 --> 55:15.042
Aha! Big Bertha, the bouncer
at the Boom Boom Bar.

55:37.459 --> 55:40.917
Hey! Don't do that. You'll hurt yourself.

55:45.917 --> 55:47.209
Oh!

55:57.751 --> 56:00.876
I guess we're both prisoners here, huh?

56:05.209 --> 56:08.417
Look, sniff-its. We'll hijack a sludge
gulper and drive into the city.

56:08.459 --> 56:09.542
Then what?

56:09.584 --> 56:12.459
First we get the rock then we'll take you
to Daisy in the tower.

56:16.917 --> 56:18.542
Get your wrench.

56:18.584 --> 56:21.334
Oh, man! I lost all my tools.

56:21.376 --> 56:24.292
Ah! Come on, let's go.

56:40.209 --> 56:42.167
Come on, what are you waiting for?

57:11.167 --> 57:13.042
- It's clear.
- All clear.

57:13.084 --> 57:15.167
We did it.

57:15.209 --> 57:17.459
- Yeah!
- I'm brilliant!

57:17.501 --> 57:20.626
For mammals, you guys are quite
acceptable.

57:28.792 --> 57:30.917
Isn't this a little bit feminine?

57:30.959 --> 57:32.584
Yes, I know. It was my ex-wife's.

57:32.626 --> 57:34.209
But you wear this stuff?

57:34.251 --> 57:36.709
Yes, on occasion we have a date.

01:03:29.292 --> 01:03:32.501
Improbable, unlikely, but
never impossible.

01:03:32.542 --> 01:03:34.626
I hope you're right.

01:03:51.459 --> 01:03:53.417
My my!

01:03:53.459 --> 01:03:56.542
You have let yourself go.

01:03:56.584 --> 01:04:02.542
See? I'm not such a bad guy.

01:04:02.584 --> 01:04:06.959
You always wanted to be everywhere.
Well, now you are.

01:04:10.042 --> 01:04:11.917
I wanna tell you something.

01:04:11.959 --> 01:04:16.417
You can go ahead and choke this little
mushroom kingdom all you want.

01:04:16.459 --> 01:04:18.167
Cos I'm outta here.

01:04:18.209 --> 01:04:20.084
I'm out into the bigger world.

01:04:20.126 --> 01:04:25.042
I got a couple of plumbers bringing me
the rest of the meteorite.

01:04:25.084 --> 01:04:28.126
Soon to be dead plumbers,
and by the way,

01:04:28.167 --> 01:04:32.959
you really outta try to pull yourself
back together again.

01:04:35.376 --> 01:04:37.959
Slime bucket!

01:04:38.001 --> 01:04:42.584
Whoa! Whoa!

01:04:42.626 --> 01:04:44.459
Whoa!

01:04:46.709 --> 01:04:48.834
Eugh!

01:04:52.334 --> 01:04:54.459
Oh my God!

01:04:54.501 --> 01:04:57.334
Daisy's in there somewhere,
I know it.

01:04:57.376 --> 01:04:59.251
Where do we start?

01:05:02.167 --> 01:05:03.834
Python Pizza here. May I help you?

01:05:03.876 --> 01:05:06.417
- King Koopa here.
- Oh, yes, sir.

01:05:06.459 --> 01:05:08.251
I'd like the Koopa Special.

01:05:08.292 --> 01:05:10.542
- Pterodactyl tail on that?
- Yes.

01:05:10.584 --> 01:05:15.209
Dino, lizard, hold the mammal, no worms,
and... spicy.

01:05:38.501 --> 01:05:42.126
Look at this.
It's a plumber's nightmare.

01:05:42.167 --> 01:05:44.751
These pipes haven't been serviced
for years.

01:05:44.792 --> 01:05:47.292
Must've been a non-union job.

01:05:52.584 --> 01:05:56.626
Luigi, lock all four of these valves.

01:05:56.667 --> 01:05:59.376
- What?
- It's the heating system.

01:06:01.459 --> 01:06:02.709
Ow!

01:06:02.751 --> 01:06:05.917
Treat your tools like a friend.
Keep 'em by you.

01:06:05.959 --> 01:06:08.584
Never let 'em down, and they're always
at your side.

01:06:08.626 --> 01:06:11.751
Hey, Mario, how come in every situation
that can possibly come up,

01:06:11.792 --> 01:06:13.667
you always got a saying about tools, huh?

01:06:15.001 --> 01:06:17.667
I got 'em from Poppa. He got 'em from
Grandpoppa.

01:06:17.709 --> 01:06:20.709
We'll freeze 'em. Keep 'em busy
while we make our way up.

01:06:20.751 --> 01:06:23.167
How can we do that?
We can't just take an elevator.

01:06:23.209 --> 01:06:26.667
We gotta do something. We tripped the
alarm. What do you think I am? Stupid?

01:06:26.709 --> 01:06:28.751
Yes. How we gonna get up? Huh?

01:06:28.792 --> 01:06:31.251
Like Marios.

01:06:34.667 --> 01:06:36.084
Haha!

01:06:37.792 --> 01:06:40.209
Ingeniously.

01:06:40.251 --> 01:06:42.667
Come on.

01:06:46.251 --> 01:06:48.209
Glug-glug-glug-glug!

01:06:51.709 --> 01:06:54.209
Look out!

01:07:00.501 --> 01:07:05.167
Elevator ingenious, Mario! Ingenious!

01:07:13.251 --> 01:07:15.751
I think you ought to know that
Iggy and Spike

01:07:15.792 --> 01:07:18.417
have been preaching your overthrow
at the Boom Boom Bar.

01:07:18.459 --> 01:07:21.626
Really? I am very disappointed in you,
cousins.

01:07:21.667 --> 01:07:23.959
- Fascist!
- Oppressor of the Proletariat!

01:07:24.001 --> 01:07:26.126
Guy in charge!

01:07:26.167 --> 01:07:27.292
Egg sucker!

01:07:27.334 --> 01:07:28.542
Kill them!

01:07:28.584 --> 01:07:30.792
Koopa, we need to talk. I want you.

01:07:30.834 --> 01:07:33.084
This is hardly the time and place
for that, Lena.

01:07:33.126 --> 01:07:36.709
I didn't mean that. What I mean is I think
we can do this together. I can help you.

01:07:36.751 --> 01:07:41.001
I have just found out that I have
saboteurs in the tower.

01:07:41.042 --> 01:07:43.542
I still do not have the meteorite piece.

01:07:43.584 --> 01:07:45.251
I am about to lose everything.

01:07:45.292 --> 01:07:49.376
We can talk about this later,
if later even occurs.

01:07:49.417 --> 01:07:51.667
What you care about is her.

01:07:51.709 --> 01:07:57.209
What I care about... is the future
of our species.

01:07:59.417 --> 01:08:01.084
Very well then.

01:08:01.126 --> 01:08:05.292
If not with you...
then on my own.

01:08:21.292 --> 01:08:24.167
- Now what are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

01:08:27.209 --> 01:08:29.001
Listen...

01:08:31.792 --> 01:08:35.917
- What?
- Trust me.

01:08:39.001 --> 01:08:40.626
What are you...?

01:08:40.667 --> 01:08:44.459
Somewhere My Love)

01:08:57.209 --> 01:09:00.376
One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three.

01:09:29.876 --> 01:09:31.167
For me?

01:09:33.209 --> 01:09:35.334
I'm a vegetarian.

01:09:35.376 --> 01:09:37.876
I don't eat anything with a face.

01:09:37.917 --> 01:09:42.126
I am kinda hungry though.

01:09:42.167 --> 01:09:46.417
Any chance of a plate of steamed
vegetables?

01:09:46.459 --> 01:09:49.626
Am I interrupting?

01:09:52.751 --> 01:09:54.292
Out!

01:09:59.542 --> 01:10:03.751
Lena, look, I know you don't want me here.

01:10:03.792 --> 01:10:05.751
So maybe...

01:10:09.501 --> 01:10:11.501
I like this room. Don't you?

01:10:11.542 --> 01:10:15.834
It used to be my office, you know,
until I got promoted.

01:10:15.876 --> 01:10:18.959
Koopa needed me close by, you see.

01:10:19.001 --> 01:10:23.209
Lena, will you help me get out of here?

01:10:23.251 --> 01:10:26.334
Well, I think yes.

01:10:26.376 --> 01:10:30.251
I'd love to get you out of here.

01:10:30.292 --> 01:10:31.792
Why are you doing this?

01:10:31.834 --> 01:10:35.126
Because everyone deserves what
they've earned.

01:10:36.209 --> 01:10:38.126
And I've earned this.

01:11:53.126 --> 01:11:54.459
YOU?

01:11:54.501 --> 01:11:57.917
- Yes, it's us.
- Your most royal highness, please...

01:11:57.959 --> 01:12:00.292
ls it possible you could assist us
in escaping?

01:12:00.334 --> 01:12:02.334
- Help!
- Help us please!

01:12:03.917 --> 01:12:06.501
Help!

01:12:08.667 --> 01:12:10.626
Spikosaurus, follow me!

01:12:13.001 --> 01:12:15.667
- Where are you going?
- I have to help him.

01:12:20.667 --> 01:12:22.626
Stand still.

01:12:24.626 --> 01:12:25.834
You stay. I'll go.

01:12:25.876 --> 01:12:27.042
OK, I'll stay, you go.

01:12:27.084 --> 01:12:28.834
- You stay and I'll go.
- OK, I'll go.

01:12:28.876 --> 01:12:30.417
Allow me.

01:12:30.459 --> 01:12:32.042
I hope he's all right.

01:12:32.084 --> 01:12:35.292
Princess Daisy, we've always been
your loyalist supporters.

01:12:35.334 --> 01:12:37.626
We've been with your father
since his demise.

01:12:37.667 --> 01:12:39.834
My father? What do you know about
my father?

01:12:39.876 --> 01:12:40.959
Come with us.

01:12:46.792 --> 01:12:49.001
- You tell her.
- No, I think you should tell her.

01:12:49.042 --> 01:12:50.792
All right. We'll both tell her.

01:12:50.834 --> 01:12:53.459
Daisy, I think this may come as something
of a shock.

01:12:53.501 --> 01:12:56.209
Daisy, may I present to you...

01:12:57.501 --> 01:12:59.084
your father.

01:12:59.126 --> 01:13:01.751
The fungus.

01:13:01.792 --> 01:13:06.084
Koopa's first victim of de-evolution.

01:13:06.126 --> 01:13:09.001
This is my father?

01:13:09.042 --> 01:13:10.376
Yes.

01:13:12.001 --> 01:13:14.876
Perhaps at this moment of delicacy...

01:13:14.917 --> 01:13:16.584
A delicate moment...

01:13:16.626 --> 01:13:19.709
- A retreat is in order.
- An ordered retreat.

01:13:21.584 --> 01:13:26.334
- Those that fight and run away...
- Live to fight another day.

01:13:31.417 --> 01:13:33.251
How did you know they'd do that?

01:13:33.292 --> 01:13:35.501
Cos everybody loves to dance, that's why.

01:13:35.542 --> 01:13:36.626
A dancing lizard

01:13:36.667 --> 01:13:39.334
like dancing crocodiles. Oh!

01:13:39.376 --> 01:13:41.834
- Oh wow!
- Oh man!

01:13:41.876 --> 01:13:46.126
Oh, I hate heights.

01:13:46.167 --> 01:13:48.334
How are we gonna get across?

01:13:48.376 --> 01:13:51.126
- I can make it. I got a good feeling.
- You're not gonna jump.

01:13:51.167 --> 01:13:53.917
Come on. Somebody's gotta do it.
I don't got no choice, right?

01:13:53.959 --> 01:13:56.751
- Luigi, this is not Miraculous World.
- I gotta go for it.

01:13:56.792 --> 01:13:58.459
- Agh! " Luigi!

01:14:04.292 --> 01:14:07.042
I'm flying, Mario, I'm flying!

01:14:07.084 --> 01:14:10.542
Come on. I told you. All you had to do
is trust. Come on.

01:14:10.584 --> 01:14:13.126
Let's do it. Come on. Just have faith.
Jump.

01:14:13.167 --> 01:14:16.251
- You're flying.
- Come on, Mario. Just trust. Jump.

01:14:16.292 --> 01:14:17.876
- Come on.
- OK, OK.

01:14:17.917 --> 01:14:20.501
- OK. Just... OK.
- Come on.

01:14:23.084 --> 01:14:25.251
No, wait, Mario. Don't jump. It's not...

01:14:25.292 --> 01:14:27.792
I'm not flying. It's just a... hook.

01:14:27.834 --> 01:14:29.917
- Agh!
- Mario!

01:14:29.959 --> 01:14:33.876
- Oh, Luigi!
- Oops!

01:14:33.917 --> 01:14:35.334
Sorry!

01:14:35.376 --> 01:14:38.251
Mario, I got you.

01:14:38.292 --> 01:14:40.709
Luigi, I'm alive.

01:14:40.751 --> 01:14:44.792
Good catch, huh, Mario?
I should try out for the Yankees.

01:14:44.834 --> 01:14:48.126
I'd high five you, but then you'd be
an only child.

01:14:48.167 --> 01:14:50.042
Let's go get Daisy.

01:14:50.084 --> 01:14:52.042
Let's swing over there, yeah?

01:14:52.084 --> 01:14:53.876
- Go with me.
- OK.

01:15:01.209 --> 01:15:03.751
My father?

01:15:03.792 --> 01:15:06.459
What have they done to you?

01:15:06.501 --> 01:15:08.834
Can you even hear me?

01:15:20.626 --> 01:15:22.376
Yoshi!

01:15:25.459 --> 01:15:28.084
Look what she did to you.

01:16:05.167 --> 01:16:08.084
- Mario?
- Daisy!

01:16:08.126 --> 01:16:09.626
Luigi?

01:16:09.667 --> 01:16:11.459
Mario!

01:16:11.501 --> 01:16:14.084
It's Daisy. Daisy, we're comin'!

01:16:17.376 --> 01:16:20.167
Let's get you off.

01:16:20.209 --> 01:16:22.626
Luigi, Mario, can you hear me?

01:16:22.667 --> 01:16:24.334
Daisy, where are you?

01:16:24.376 --> 01:16:27.751
I'm in Devo 4.

01:16:27.792 --> 01:16:30.584
Daisy.

01:16:34.459 --> 01:16:36.459
Oh, man, it's cold.

01:16:36.501 --> 01:16:39.042
- It's working. It's freezing up.
- Great!

01:16:41.292 --> 01:16:44.084
Hey, Mario, did you see that?

01:16:44.126 --> 01:16:46.334
- What?
- It's trying to communicate.

01:16:49.209 --> 01:16:52.709
Luigi, it's a mushroom. Come on.

01:17:06.251 --> 01:17:08.126
Luigi, here!

01:17:08.167 --> 01:17:11.084
- Come back. In here. This way.
- There she is.

01:17:15.834 --> 01:17:19.459
Good news, sir. The troops are in place
ready to de-evolve the mammals.

01:17:19.501 --> 01:17:21.876
Place ready to what? Now?

01:17:21.917 --> 01:17:24.001
Who ordered their deployment?

01:17:24.042 --> 01:17:27.959
You did, sir. Lena relayed the command.
We carried it out immediately.

01:17:28.001 --> 01:17:29.667
Lena?

01:17:31.876 --> 01:17:33.501
She has the rock.

01:17:33.542 --> 01:17:35.792
Arrest her!

01:17:35.834 --> 01:17:38.042
- Daisy! " Luigi!

01:17:38.084 --> 01:17:41.042
Let's get out of here. This place is
crawling with giant lizards.

01:17:41.084 --> 01:17:45.501
Wait, listen. I know this is going to
sound a little strange but...

01:17:45.542 --> 01:17:47.334
I want you to meet...

01:17:49.209 --> 01:17:50.959
my father.

01:17:54.584 --> 01:17:57.501
Come on. Dad.

01:18:01.209 --> 01:18:04.876
- Oh man.
- Well, at least he was my father.

01:18:04.917 --> 01:18:06.459
He used to be the leader here,

01:18:06.501 --> 01:18:11.334
until Koopa turned him into
all this... fungus.

01:18:11.376 --> 01:18:13.042
- Oh, man!
- Well...

01:18:13.084 --> 01:18:16.292
Well, it's an honour to meet you, sir,
and a pleasure

01:18:16.334 --> 01:18:19.376
and I just wanna thank you
for all your help.

01:18:19.417 --> 01:18:22.917
Come on, Luigi, you'll be talking to
the mildew in the shower next.

01:18:22.959 --> 01:18:25.626
Mario, don't you see? It's been trying to
help us all along,

01:18:25.667 --> 01:18:28.417
giving us the little things,
when we were hanging there.

01:18:28.459 --> 01:18:30.542
Come on. He wants to clobber Koopa too.

01:18:30.584 --> 01:18:31.959
How's Daniella?

01:18:32.001 --> 01:18:33.792
- Is she all right?
- Daniella!

01:18:33.834 --> 01:18:36.792
I promised to take her to Wrestle Mania.

01:18:36.834 --> 01:18:38.667
You mean you don't know?

01:18:40.751 --> 01:18:42.667
What?

01:18:42.709 --> 01:18:46.792
She's in the goomba barracks
on the 51st floor.

01:18:53.376 --> 01:18:56.459
- Come on, we need to help!
- Hi-di-ho, mammals.

01:18:56.501 --> 01:18:58.417
Goombas!

01:18:58.459 --> 01:19:00.834
If you touch her I'll kill you.

01:19:00.876 --> 01:19:03.584
I'll meet you in the playground
after school.

01:19:03.626 --> 01:19:04.834
You murderer!

01:19:04.876 --> 01:19:10.459
Now, your father's still... hanging around,
isn't he?

01:19:10.501 --> 01:19:14.709
Prepare for the invasion,
and ready the troops.

01:19:14.751 --> 01:19:17.542
We're going down.

01:19:17.584 --> 01:19:22.792
<i>Station closing. Military personnel only.</i>

01:19:22.834 --> 01:19:27.001
<i>Station closing. Military personnel only.</i>

01:19:27.042 --> 01:19:31.126
Hey, you. Open UP-

01:19:32.584 --> 01:19:36.334
<i>Restricted area. No unauthorised
personnel.</i>

01:19:36.376 --> 01:19:41.542
<i>Restricted area. No unauthorised
personnel.</i>

01:19:50.334 --> 01:19:52.667
Agh!

01:19:52.709 --> 01:19:54.126
Greetings from Koopa.

01:19:54.167 --> 01:19:56.001
Agh!

01:19:56.042 --> 01:19:57.667
Ah, the rock.

01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:59.417
Can't we get some blankets.

01:19:59.459 --> 01:20:01.334
Yeah, we're freezing.

01:20:01.376 --> 01:20:03.709
Look, the point is we're freezing here.

01:20:03.751 --> 01:20:05.709
They are not going to believe this
at work.

01:20:05.751 --> 01:20:07.834
This is a violation of
our civil liberties.

01:20:07.876 --> 01:20:11.209
Can't you get somebody to fix the heating?

01:20:27.001 --> 01:20:31.251
How can they let us suffer like this?
What are they? Cold-blooded?

01:20:31.292 --> 01:20:34.751
- Yes, moron. They're reptiles.
- Well, just because they're reptiles...

01:20:48.959 --> 01:20:51.501
Angelica, come here.

01:20:51.542 --> 01:20:56.042
Don't say anything, but my boyfriend
Mario's right up there.

01:20:56.084 --> 01:20:58.417
- What?
- Shh!

01:20:58.459 --> 01:21:00.834
Hey! Mario!

01:21:00.876 --> 01:21:03.001
What are you doing here?

01:21:07.584 --> 01:21:12.084
Yam Oh, Mario, I knew
you'd come for me!

01:21:12.126 --> 01:21:13.626
- You betcha!
- Yes! He did it!

01:21:13.667 --> 01:21:17.459
Honey, listen. Get that mattress, the
goomba mattress. Take it over there.

01:21:17.501 --> 01:21:20.876
Come on, girls. Get the goomba mattress.
Pick it up, get that side.

01:21:20.917 --> 01:21:25.001
Move it, move it.

01:21:25.042 --> 01:21:26.876
Come on. Bring it over here.

01:21:28.209 --> 01:21:29.751
Very good!

01:21:29.792 --> 01:21:33.917
Hey! You must be the missing girls
from Brooklyn.

01:21:33.959 --> 01:21:36.334
Except Angelica - she's from Queens,
but she's all right.

01:21:36.376 --> 01:21:39.917
Hey, I'm freezing my butt off here.
There's cold air from that air vent.

01:21:39.959 --> 01:21:43.084
Yeah, we froze the pipes.
We're going for a little ride.

01:21:43.126 --> 01:21:45.292
Hail Koopa.

01:21:50.209 --> 01:21:52.626
Sir?

01:21:52.667 --> 01:21:55.084
I believe you are looking for this.

01:22:02.001 --> 01:22:04.542
Excellent. Release Lena.

01:22:04.584 --> 01:22:08.292
Princess, ready to help me destroy
humankind?

01:22:08.334 --> 01:22:10.792
Muster the goombas.

01:22:10.834 --> 01:22:15.709
Hand out the de-evolution guns.
Prepare for destiny!

01:22:18.584 --> 01:22:19.917
Where's my pizza?

01:22:59.834 --> 01:23:02.292
Goombas!

01:23:06.417 --> 01:23:08.626
Down!

01:23:08.667 --> 01:23:11.001
Duck now!

01:23:32.417 --> 01:23:35.209
Got ya! Yeah!

01:23:47.751 --> 01:23:49.876
Devo guns ready?

01:23:52.876 --> 01:23:54.876
Yeah! Woo-hoo!

01:23:59.584 --> 01:24:01.709
Agh!

01:24:14.626 --> 01:24:16.501
Are you all right?

01:24:16.542 --> 01:24:19.126
- Are they all right?
- Right!

01:24:21.459 --> 01:24:24.042
- Marioroni!
- Daniella!

01:24:24.084 --> 01:24:26.167
Too late, humans.

01:24:26.209 --> 01:24:28.417
<i>Sir, your pizza's here.</i>

01:24:28.459 --> 01:24:29.626
Not now.

01:24:29.667 --> 01:24:32.751
Looks like I win.

01:24:32.792 --> 01:24:37.667
Soon you and everyone in your world will
all be de-evolved into...

01:24:37.709 --> 01:24:39.084
<i>Sir? Sir?</i>

01:24:39.126 --> 01:24:42.417
<i>- What is it now?
- The goombas are dancing again.</i>

01:24:42.459 --> 01:24:45.501
Deal with it.

01:24:45.542 --> 01:24:49.126
Will be de-evolved into monkeys.

01:24:54.292 --> 01:24:56.084
Agh!

01:24:57.834 --> 01:24:59.126
Give me that.

01:25:06.334 --> 01:25:07.584
Ah! Yes!

01:25:09.792 --> 01:25:12.042
Die, plumbers!

01:25:15.126 --> 01:25:17.792
Take my tools and get out of those
handcuffs.

01:25:17.834 --> 01:25:18.876
- Mario!
- What?

01:25:18.917 --> 01:25:21.084
Take my belt.

01:25:21.126 --> 01:25:23.126
Trust the fungus.

01:25:25.126 --> 01:25:26.709
Trust the fungus.

01:25:28.042 --> 01:25:29.917
Look out!

01:25:33.251 --> 01:25:36.292
All right! Ya-hay!

01:25:58.417 --> 01:26:00.334
Agh!

01:26:03.917 --> 01:26:07.042
Yes! Agh!

01:26:10.626 --> 01:26:13.126
You wanna rock? I'll give you a rock.

01:26:23.334 --> 01:26:25.209
Where's the rock?

01:26:25.251 --> 01:26:27.209
Hey!

01:26:27.251 --> 01:26:28.751
You looking for this?

01:26:28.792 --> 01:26:30.292
Give it to me.

01:26:32.334 --> 01:26:35.751
Give me that rock, you monkey. It's mine!

01:26:35.792 --> 01:26:37.792
Give it to me!

01:26:40.376 --> 01:26:42.251
- I'll show him!
- We've gotta stop her!

01:26:42.292 --> 01:26:44.917
- Come on, girls, let's go.
- Who are you?

01:26:44.959 --> 01:26:47.876
Luigi Mario. You got a problem with that?

01:26:47.917 --> 01:26:50.751
- I don't got a problem.
- Let's go.

01:26:50.792 --> 01:26:52.334
Come on!

01:26:54.917 --> 01:26:59.251
My time has come! The universe is mine!

01:26:59.292 --> 01:27:03.417
You mammal, you give me that rock!

01:27:14.001 --> 01:27:15.667
Agh!

01:27:24.792 --> 01:27:28.459
My time will come!

01:27:28.501 --> 01:27:31.626
The rock will merge our two dimensions.
Lena, don't!

01:27:31.667 --> 01:27:33.959
You're too late.

01:27:34.001 --> 01:27:39.126
You see, I do have the power
to merge the worlds, princess.

01:27:39.167 --> 01:27:41.126
It's not too late. We've gotta stop her.

01:27:41.167 --> 01:27:43.792
All right. Come on, girls.
Come on, let's go.

01:27:43.834 --> 01:27:45.042
Wait! Where are we going?

01:27:45.084 --> 01:27:46.959
Back to where you came. Come this way.

01:27:50.501 --> 01:27:53.917
Come and get it, lizard breath.

01:27:58.167 --> 01:28:01.709
- It's a bob-omb!
- He's got a bob-omb!

01:28:03.334 --> 01:28:04.876
Bob-omb?

01:28:30.584 --> 01:28:33.959
Messed up again, mammal.

01:28:41.792 --> 01:28:44.626
All right. Come on.

01:28:44.667 --> 01:28:46.292
Come and get it.

01:28:46.334 --> 01:28:47.751
Come on.

01:28:47.792 --> 01:28:50.584
Come on, rufflehead, let's see
what you're made of.

01:28:59.126 --> 01:29:00.751
Don't look down!

01:29:00.792 --> 01:29:03.167
You've gotta get through and tell
everybody.

01:29:03.209 --> 01:29:07.709
Go to Brooklyn. Tell them about
the invasion and the goombas.

01:29:07.751 --> 01:29:11.209
Good luck, Luigi!

01:29:11.251 --> 01:29:13.917
It's incredible!

01:29:23.751 --> 01:29:25.334
Yikes!

01:29:25.376 --> 01:29:28.417
Man, she sure makes an impression.

01:29:30.959 --> 01:29:32.709
That's what Koopa meant.

01:29:32.751 --> 01:29:35.792
Only I can withstand the force.

01:29:35.834 --> 01:29:37.751
Come on.

01:29:39.709 --> 01:29:42.334
It's jammed in. I can't get it.

01:29:42.376 --> 01:29:45.501
Luigi, we've gotta stop it,
we've gotta get it out.

01:29:46.792 --> 01:29:48.667
Grab onto me.

01:29:52.959 --> 01:29:55.626
Come and get it.

01:29:58.292 --> 01:30:00.251
Oh!

01:30:07.001 --> 01:30:08.834
It's melting.

01:30:08.876 --> 01:30:11.542
We're merging.

01:30:11.584 --> 01:30:16.209
You don't have the rock!
You filthy mammal!

01:30:21.959 --> 01:30:24.292
We're merging!

01:30:30.542 --> 01:30:32.876
I'm gonna drill it out.

01:30:32.917 --> 01:30:35.501
Give me the wheel puller.
It looks like a corkscrew.

01:30:35.542 --> 01:30:37.209
- This?
- Yeah.

01:30:39.334 --> 01:30:41.667
Hold on to me, all right?

01:30:47.042 --> 01:30:50.542
Look! It's Koopa's tower!

01:30:50.584 --> 01:30:52.584
Those guys will do anything for publicity.

01:30:58.292 --> 01:31:00.251
Mario?

01:31:00.292 --> 01:31:03.001
Ugh! Dah!

01:31:03.042 --> 01:31:06.959
It's Brooklyn! My world!

01:31:07.001 --> 01:31:09.792
Give me that devo gun.

01:31:14.251 --> 01:31:17.834
What is this?

01:31:21.251 --> 01:31:23.334
Monkey!

01:31:25.084 --> 01:31:26.792
Scapelli?

01:31:36.709 --> 01:31:41.459
Boss! What did they do to you?

01:31:41.501 --> 01:31:45.542
And now, I'm gonna make a monkey
out of you, plumber.

01:31:45.584 --> 01:31:47.584
Trust the fungus.

01:31:56.751 --> 01:32:00.042
What? No!

01:32:21.751 --> 01:32:24.167
Bob-omb!

01:32:33.626 --> 01:32:36.292
- What are you doing?
- It's OK.

01:32:36.334 --> 01:32:38.251
He's a friend.

01:32:49.709 --> 01:32:52.501
Mario!

01:32:54.084 --> 01:32:57.751
Shoot him! Shoot him!

01:33:11.292 --> 01:33:13.167
Stupid!

01:33:19.209 --> 01:33:20.667
Agh!

01:33:20.709 --> 01:33:23.042
Plumber!

01:33:28.251 --> 01:33:30.376
Get those plumbers!

01:33:31.584 --> 01:33:32.959
Duck!

01:34:29.501 --> 01:34:31.709
See ya later, alligator.

01:35:15.251 --> 01:35:17.501
- Need a lift?
- What?

01:35:17.542 --> 01:35:19.334
- Come on. Get on my feet.
- All right.

01:35:42.459 --> 01:35:44.792
Oh, Luigi! Mario!

01:36:12.251 --> 01:36:13.917
I'm back!

01:36:13.959 --> 01:36:15.959
Love those plumbers.

01:36:33.667 --> 01:36:35.667
It's solid.

01:36:43.876 --> 01:36:47.167
All right! Come on. Let's go.

01:36:47.209 --> 01:36:49.042
I can't.

01:36:51.251 --> 01:36:52.667
You mean you wanna stay?

01:36:52.709 --> 01:36:58.292
Until we can get things settled here
and... I can get to know my father.

01:36:58.334 --> 01:37:00.792
Come on, Daisy. You know how
I feel about you, right?

01:37:02.501 --> 01:37:05.084
I wanna be with you.

01:37:05.126 --> 01:37:09.126
I do too but... I can't.

01:37:09.167 --> 01:37:14.084
She's trying to tell you she can't leave
here till she knows where she belongs.

01:37:14.126 --> 01:37:16.459
If you loved her, you'd understand that.

01:37:19.751 --> 01:37:22.917
And if I had any sense,
I'd mind my own business.

01:37:35.501 --> 01:37:37.042
OK, come on.

01:37:43.334 --> 01:37:45.251
Come on.

01:38:07.959 --> 01:38:10.376
It's open. Come on, Luigi.

01:38:10.417 --> 01:38:11.792
Come on.

<i>Are these the sounds of a music that comes
to us across the vastness of space?</i>

01:38:28.792 --> 01:38:30.626
<i>Judge for yourself.</i>

01:38:30.667 --> 01:38:33.417
Hey, love the dress.
I've never seen it before.

01:38:33.459 --> 01:38:36.959
That's what you said last time
you saw it, Mr Wonderful!

01:38:37.001 --> 01:38:40.209
Luigi, are you gonna stop
moping around? Come on.

01:38:40.251 --> 01:38:42.167
Luigi, come and eat.

01:38:42.209 --> 01:38:44.334
<i>Story of the Mario Brothers.</i>

01:38:44.376 --> 01:38:46.584
Mario! We're on The Miraculous World.

- Yes!

01:39:09.251 --> 01:39:10.751
Daisy!

01:39:10.792 --> 01:39:12.792
You gotta come with me. I need your help.

01:39:12.834 --> 01:39:14.167
What's wrong?

01:39:14.209 --> 01:39:16.709
You're never gonna believe this.

01:39:16.751 --> 01:39:19.042
- I believe it.
- You do?

01:39:19.084 --> 01:39:21.417
