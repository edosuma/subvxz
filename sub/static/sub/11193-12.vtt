WEBVTT

00:05.400 --> 00:07.809
<i>Previously on Stargate SG-1...</i>

00:07.881 --> 00:10.919
We have to activate the Chaapa-ai.
Quickly, Jolinar!

00:10.961 --> 00:15.173
Portions of Jolinar of Malk-shur
may remain in Captain Carter's mind.

00:15.162 --> 00:20.120
My vision is our only lead. Shouldn't we
at least check it out before they move on?

00:24.481 --> 00:26.475
<i>We mean you no harm.</i>

00:26.562 --> 00:30.062
But if you make any aggressive moves,
we will fire upon you.

00:30.082 --> 00:31.792
- Martouf.
- How do you know me?

00:31.882 --> 00:36.048
I don't. But I knew someone who did.
His name was Jolinar of Malk-shur.

00:36.042 --> 00:38.713
That's why we're here.
To seek out the Tok'ra.

00:38.762 --> 00:42.097
I was under the impression that
the cancer hadn't gone this far.

00:42.124 --> 00:43.749
So was I.

00:43.843 --> 00:45.218
Take me to your leader.

00:53.243 --> 00:57.326
Legend says that when the Tok'ra arrive
on a planet, they go deep underground.

00:57.323 --> 01:00.777
It is said they possess
the technology to grow tunnels.

01:00.804 --> 01:04.885
<i>Let me introduce
Grand Council Garshaw of Belote.</i>

01:04.885 --> 01:07.721
<i>She's the most hunted Goa'uld of all time.</i>

01:07.766 --> 01:10.802
Allow me to introduce Selmak.

01:10.844 --> 01:13.051
<i>She is unfortunately very ill...</i>

01:13.125 --> 01:14.620
...and will soon die.

01:14.724 --> 01:17.846
Unless one of you wishes
to volunteer to serve as a host.

01:24.447 --> 01:26.072
He's in V-tach! We'll shock him!

01:26.165 --> 01:27.329
Clear!

01:27.447 --> 01:29.439
<i>How long does he have?</i>

01:29.525 --> 01:32.563
If there's any family to contact,
I'd get them here ASAP

01:32.606 --> 01:35.644
<i>The Chaapa-ai just brought forth these!</i>

01:35.686 --> 01:38.438
<i>- SG-3.
- Colonel Makepeace?</i>

01:38.486 --> 01:42.236
It's your father, Captain.
He's in the hospital in a serious condition.

01:42.247 --> 01:45.001
Captain Carter's father is dying.
At least let her go.

01:45.048 --> 01:47.539
<i>She is the highest risk of all.</i>

01:47.608 --> 01:50.146
She contains the memory
of Jolinar of Malk-shur.

01:53.769 --> 01:55.762
<i>And now... the conclusion.</i>

02:00.849 --> 02:02.841
<i>You wish to see me?</i>

02:08.250 --> 02:09.828
Daniel?

02:10.889 --> 02:15.766
Garshaw, could you tell us why you have
turned down our request for an alliance?

02:15.730 --> 02:20.359
We've decided that your limited resources
do not offer us enough of a reward...

02:20.330 --> 02:24.875
...to risk the high security breach
that your knowledge of us will cause.

02:24.849 --> 02:26.013
That's it?

02:27.211 --> 02:30.663
At least allow us some time
to try to find some technology,...

02:30.692 --> 02:32.685
...some skill that you don't have.

02:32.771 --> 02:36.557
I'm sorry. I don't believe it exists.

02:37.651 --> 02:40.108
<i>So we are prisoners.</i>

02:41.091 --> 02:43.843
You're looking like Goa'uld to me.

02:43.891 --> 02:47.143
<i>We're doing this
for your protection as well as ours.</i>

02:47.171 --> 02:51.468
Knowledge of our whereabouts makes
you and your world a priority target...

02:51.453 --> 02:53.445
...for the Goa'uld System Lords.

02:53.533 --> 02:57.116
- We're already a priority target!
- They previously dispatched...

02:57.133 --> 02:59.210
...two mother ships to destroy us.

02:59.293 --> 03:01.831
<i>There's another reason, isn't there?</i>

03:01.893 --> 03:05.394
<i>- Something else bothers you about us.
- That is correct.</i>

03:06.693 --> 03:11.108
None of you have volunteered
to be host to one of us who is dying.

03:11.093 --> 03:16.600
If you're so disgusted by the very thought
of blending, how can we be associated...

03:16.534 --> 03:20.783
...with one another? It is obvious
that you have distaste for our very being.

03:20.775 --> 03:25.438
No, it is simply a lack of understanding.
We have no hatred for you at all.

03:25.414 --> 03:27.408
Then be a host to Selmak!

03:27.496 --> 03:31.576
- I wish I could say that was OK, but...
- The very thought sickens you.

03:31.575 --> 03:34.780
There is nothing more to be said.
There will be no alliance!

03:34.817 --> 03:37.652
You will remain here
until we say otherwise.

05:16.262 --> 05:17.841
Colonel Makepeace?

05:21.223 --> 05:23.550
Did anyone tell you
how far along my father is?

05:24.745 --> 05:28.411
No. I was only told to get you back
as soon as possible.

05:29.983 --> 05:32.605
He doesn't even know
why I'm not there for him.

05:33.264 --> 05:36.350
He thinks I'm off working on
some damn satellite dish!

05:37.985 --> 05:39.894
We'll get you back there, Carter.

05:41.425 --> 05:45.257
The good news is...
there's eight of us now.

05:45.264 --> 05:47.223
That's good news?

05:47.305 --> 05:48.716
Yes.

05:48.824 --> 05:50.617
More manpower.

05:53.386 --> 05:56.007
Is this another one
of your strange jokes, O'Neill?

05:56.066 --> 05:58.189
Uh, no.

05:58.266 --> 06:00.805
<i>It would be impossible.</i>

06:00.867 --> 06:03.488
There is only one way out... via the rings.

06:04.427 --> 06:06.884
We would then have to elude
hundreds of Tok'ra.

06:06.947 --> 06:09.617
I, for one, don't want to hurt any of them.

06:09.668 --> 06:13.749
Look, I'm not too thrilled
about hurting anyone either.

06:13.747 --> 06:16.786
But keep in mind these people
wanna make you a host!

06:16.826 --> 06:21.954
You said the Jolinar-in-the-head deal was
one of the worst things to happen to you.

06:21.908 --> 06:26.737
That's before I understood it better.
If I wasn't fighting her...

06:26.707 --> 06:30.576
...and I knew what it meant for Jolinar
to be a Tok'ra, it might've been...

06:30.588 --> 06:32.581
...I don't know... enlightening.

06:35.788 --> 06:37.781
I need to see Garshaw!

06:41.670 --> 06:42.619
What?

06:42.749 --> 06:46.036
What is the one thing
that they need the most?

06:47.391 --> 06:49.514
Well, hosts, which we can't give them.

06:51.031 --> 06:53.024
<i>What is it?</i>

06:54.430 --> 06:57.136
You said the symbiote can cure
most problems in a human.

06:57.191 --> 06:58.353
Yes.

06:58.470 --> 07:00.961
Does that include cancer?

07:01.031 --> 07:03.321
What is cancer?

07:03.391 --> 07:09.098
It's a disease in humans where the cells
grow out of control. You get tumours...

07:09.031 --> 07:14.158
Oh, yes. It's a common ailment amongst
your species. We cure it all the time.

07:15.271 --> 07:19.187
Colonel, I think we should
at least try to offer it to my dad.

07:26.713 --> 07:28.706
We might have a host for you.

07:28.793 --> 07:33.042
- You have a host for Selmak?
- Yes. My father.

07:33.033 --> 07:38.112
He's got cancer and if Selmak can save
his life, I think he'd be willing to try it.

07:38.074 --> 07:39.817
But you have to let us go back.

07:42.673 --> 07:44.667
I will let two of you go.

07:44.754 --> 07:48.588
But the rest will remain
to ensure that you will return.

08:00.795 --> 08:04.461
Colonel, where's SG-3? They were
meant to extract only Captain Carter.

08:04.475 --> 08:06.468
General, we need to talk.

08:11.117 --> 08:12.694
Captain Carter...

08:13.555 --> 08:16.391
I am truly sorry about your father,...

08:16.437 --> 08:20.731
...but I have to question the wisdom
of what you're suggesting here.

08:22.478 --> 08:24.555
From what I've seen,...

08:24.637 --> 08:29.430
...this won't exactly be saving his life. It'll
be more like giving his body to a Goa'uld.

08:29.398 --> 08:32.649
No, sir, more like letting one share it.

08:33.879 --> 08:37.331
Jacob knows a lot about Earth,
about the US military.

08:37.357 --> 08:40.479
We would be handing over
that information to the Goa'uld.

08:40.519 --> 08:43.936
- To the Tok'ra.
- You sure there's a difference?

08:43.958 --> 08:49.298
Oh, yes, sir, there is. I won't even pretend
to understand what it is, but there is one.

08:49.239 --> 08:53.903
One minute you're talking to a Goa'uld,
the next, a regular... guy... person.

08:53.879 --> 08:56.206
- Host.
- Host.

08:56.279 --> 08:58.238
How do you know it isn't a trick?

08:58.320 --> 09:00.527
The Goa'uld have
spoken as humans before.

09:00.600 --> 09:04.849
Well, if these were your everyday,
run-of-the-mill, greasy-assed Goa'uld,...

09:04.841 --> 09:06.833
...we would be their host already.

09:06.921 --> 09:12.166
<i>They were holding you prisoner. Still are
holding SG-3 and the rest of your team!</i>

09:13.399 --> 09:17.613
Only temporarily, sir. They thought
it was to protect us as much as them.

09:21.721 --> 09:24.841
Yeah, I didn't buy that one myself, sir.

09:25.883 --> 09:30.260
General Hammond, please.
I know my father would want to do this.

09:30.241 --> 09:32.318
He would have the chance to liaise...

09:32.402 --> 09:36.615
...between ourselves and possibly
the most important ally we will ever have.

10:00.605 --> 10:05.184
I would like to take this opportunity
to express my admiration for your cause.

10:05.164 --> 10:08.581
- It is both honourable and brave.
- Thank you, Jaffa.

10:08.605 --> 10:12.769
I must say I feel the same about you.
To break from Apophis...

10:12.764 --> 10:16.716
...and then turn to fight him
shows great conviction of character.

10:19.005 --> 10:23.384
Master Garshaw, we just received word
from our scout in the Shoran'ka quadrant.

10:23.366 --> 10:25.110
The Goa'uld System Lords...

10:25.206 --> 10:28.124
...have been told where we are.
They've sent two mother ships.

10:28.166 --> 10:30.575
- When will they arrive?
- Within the day.

10:30.647 --> 10:32.307
Perhaps hours.

10:32.407 --> 10:34.696
Start the evacuation!

10:54.168 --> 10:56.327
<i>Clear the room, people.</i>

11:02.249 --> 11:05.285
<i>I told you not to recall her.</i>

11:08.169 --> 11:10.163
I'm happy to see you, too, Dad.

11:11.529 --> 11:14.317
You wanted to know
what Captain Carter does.

11:14.370 --> 11:16.696
I thought she could tell you herself.

11:16.769 --> 11:20.639
Yeah? What happened
to the classification?

11:20.649 --> 11:23.817
It's still classified,
but you just got clearance.

11:29.490 --> 11:30.522
Why?

11:30.652 --> 11:33.605
Well, believe it or not,
we need your help, Dad.

11:39.572 --> 11:43.321
The Pentagon wants me to deliver
a message to God when I get up there?

11:43.331 --> 11:47.033
- Not exactly.
- Well, I don't plan to see the other guy.

11:47.052 --> 11:50.008
Dad, have you ever heard of
the Stargate programme?

11:50.052 --> 11:51.250
No.

11:51.373 --> 11:53.365
Is that one of your satellites?

11:53.452 --> 11:55.576
No, Dad. That was just a cover.

11:55.653 --> 11:58.690
No kidding. I never would have guessed.

12:00.052 --> 12:01.927
What is it that's so great...

12:02.014 --> 12:05.217
...you don't want me to get you
into the astronaut programme?

12:05.253 --> 12:08.754
Well, this is gonna be
a lot for you to take in at once.

12:08.774 --> 12:12.024
Stop beating around the bush.
What do you do?

12:13.533 --> 12:17.782
I travel to other planets. Much
farther away than any astronaut goes.

12:18.813 --> 12:21.484
So you're not gonna tell me the truth here.

12:22.294 --> 12:24.538
She is telling you the truth, Jacob.

12:26.573 --> 12:28.697
She goes to other planets?

12:28.774 --> 12:30.768
What... like in simulations?

12:30.855 --> 12:32.433
No, in reality.

12:36.536 --> 12:39.241
We discovered
a piece of alien technology.

12:39.296 --> 12:42.332
It can send us to thousands of planets
all over the galaxy.

12:42.376 --> 12:44.370
You're not kidding, are you?

12:45.615 --> 12:46.861
No.

12:46.976 --> 12:49.052
Holy Hannah!

12:54.496 --> 12:55.611
So...

12:55.736 --> 12:57.730
...what do you want me to do?

12:57.817 --> 13:01.152
Well, we'd like you to travel
to one of these planets with us.

13:01.177 --> 13:04.096
- Why? So I can die there?
- No.

13:04.138 --> 13:08.600
Actually, I'm hoping what we want
you to do will cure your cancer.

13:09.778 --> 13:11.772
They have a cure there?

13:16.538 --> 13:18.947
What's the catch?

13:20.379 --> 13:23.879
It's a doozie, Jacob.
I won't lie to you on that.

13:30.980 --> 13:32.972
<i>Chevron six locked.</i>

13:41.179 --> 13:43.885
- So this is the alien thing you found?
- Yep.

13:45.500 --> 13:47.494
And it sends you to other planets?

13:50.821 --> 13:52.815
<i>Chevron seven locked.</i>

13:57.261 --> 14:00.596
<i>- How about them apples, huh?
- Incredible.</i>

14:00.620 --> 14:02.615
Let's go, Dad.

14:14.222 --> 14:16.678
Does it... What's it feel like?

14:17.342 --> 14:19.549
You've handled worse, Dad.

14:19.624 --> 14:21.616
It's a piece of cake, sir.

14:36.184 --> 14:39.056
- You do that a lot?
- Yeah, once or twice a week.

14:40.304 --> 14:42.630
It beats a shuttle on the back of a rocket!

14:42.705 --> 14:45.411
Goes a lot further, too.

14:47.786 --> 14:51.488
You know, I was expecting
a little greeting party or something.

14:51.505 --> 14:54.756
You sure this is another planet?
It looks like Earth.

14:54.786 --> 14:59.116
We figured the Stargate system was built
specifically to transport humans...

14:59.105 --> 15:01.514
...or something close
to humans in physiology.

15:01.586 --> 15:06.333
So it seems to go mostly to places where
the environment supports human life.

15:33.548 --> 15:35.126
- Makepeace...
- Carry on.

15:35.229 --> 15:37.601
...what the heck's going on?

15:37.668 --> 15:41.253
- We're free!
- Then why are you still here?

15:41.269 --> 15:44.806
We want to be allies, right?
So we're helping with the evacuation.

15:45.948 --> 15:47.942
What evacuation?

15:48.029 --> 15:50.568
Come on, I'll explain as we go.

15:59.150 --> 16:01.903
Dad, this is Teal'c.
Teal'c, this is my father.

16:01.951 --> 16:03.943
It is an honour.

16:11.192 --> 16:14.147
This is where they've
been stacking our stuff.

16:24.471 --> 16:25.847
CheI nok'n.

16:25.952 --> 16:28.111
Direct translation - "very cool".

16:29.153 --> 16:33.235
- Wanna tell me what's going on?
- They're evacuating so we're free to go.

16:34.033 --> 16:35.361
Why?

16:35.472 --> 16:38.178
The System Lords are ready to attack.

16:38.232 --> 16:40.356
The Goa'uld mother ships are on the way.

16:40.433 --> 16:41.763
Oh.

16:49.033 --> 16:50.611
<i>Where's Garshaw?</i>

16:50.715 --> 16:55.009
- We last saw her in the Council chamber.
- All right, boys, let's go.

16:56.634 --> 16:58.628
- Call if you need me.
- Thanks.

17:09.836 --> 17:12.375
<i>You have returned.</i>

17:12.435 --> 17:15.722
Yes. This is my father - Jacob Carter.

17:15.757 --> 17:17.750
Honoured.

17:18.195 --> 17:21.614
<i>I am Martouf.
You have a very special daughter.</i>

17:21.636 --> 17:24.127
Why does he talk like that?

17:24.958 --> 17:27.497
He's a Tok'ra, Dad. I told you about them.

17:28.237 --> 17:31.523
Oh. So these are the aliens
you were telling me about?

17:31.557 --> 17:35.425
Well, I don't know if I'd call them aliens.

17:35.436 --> 17:38.272
Sort of half alien, I guess.
The outside is human...

17:38.317 --> 17:41.984
...and the inside is shared
between a human and a symbiote.

17:41.999 --> 17:45.451
Martouf is two different souls,
I guess, sharing the same body.

17:45.478 --> 17:48.848
And that's what you want me to become?

17:53.240 --> 17:55.398
You gotta be kidding me.

17:57.559 --> 18:00.596
So fill me in.
How'd the System Lords find 'em?

18:00.640 --> 18:04.009
- That is unknown.
- You talking about a spy here, or what?

18:04.039 --> 18:08.417
If that's the case, moving to another
planet's not gonna do them much good.

18:08.400 --> 18:11.105
Teal'c, you know those tele-ball things?

18:11.201 --> 18:14.737
- The long-range communications device.
- How small can they be?

18:14.760 --> 18:17.467
Small enough to fit
in the palm of your hand.

18:24.921 --> 18:26.913
I'm not sure I can do this, Sam.

18:28.441 --> 18:32.226
<i>No one wants to pressure you.
The decision is yours.</i>

18:32.241 --> 18:37.285
But, before deciding, might I suggest you
take time to get to know the symbiote...

18:37.242 --> 18:39.201
...that wishes to blend with you?

18:43.842 --> 18:45.836
This is her?

18:45.923 --> 18:49.708
Actually, you only see the host.
The symbiote's inside her.

18:50.323 --> 18:51.948
Inside her?

18:52.044 --> 18:55.130
Talk to her, Dad. Get to know her.

18:56.804 --> 19:01.800
<i>If you agree to the blending,
we could be together for...</i>

19:01.763 --> 19:03.757
...a very long time.

19:07.684 --> 19:09.678
You don't look so good.

19:09.763 --> 19:14.143
You are no vision of beauty yourself, sir.

19:27.446 --> 19:29.938
It's all right. It's all right.

19:33.846 --> 19:37.015
<i>I'm the one
to whom you should be talking.</i>

19:38.527 --> 19:42.311
You are the one I'm talking to.
Why did your voice change like that?

19:42.326 --> 19:44.784
That's the host talking now.

19:44.847 --> 19:47.173
I am Saroosh.

19:47.247 --> 19:49.405
I'm in the position to help you most.

19:49.488 --> 19:50.567
How's that?

19:50.686 --> 19:52.681
I will die.

19:53.327 --> 19:55.320
Selmak will live on.

19:55.847 --> 19:58.221
You will take my place as host.

19:59.648 --> 20:01.642
I don't understand.

20:01.729 --> 20:04.646
Selmak is a wonderful Tok'ra.

20:05.449 --> 20:07.442
She is selfIess and caring.

20:07.528 --> 20:10.733
She's good company.
She has a wonderful sense of humour.

20:10.769 --> 20:15.894
Well, that's good, Dad. You can sit
around for hours cracking yourself up.

20:15.849 --> 20:17.594
That's funny.

20:17.690 --> 20:19.682
She's not far wrong.

20:20.289 --> 20:24.240
I've had almost 200 years of laughter
thanks to Selmak.

20:25.130 --> 20:27.123
I'm biased, of course,...

20:27.211 --> 20:32.836
...but I believe Selmak is among
the best educated of the Tok'ra.

20:32.770 --> 20:36.307
You will probably be overwhelmed...

20:36.330 --> 20:39.665
...with the knowledge and wisdom
you will gain upon blending.

20:39.691 --> 20:42.017
So I get all of this thing, this, uh...

20:42.090 --> 20:44.880
- What did you call it in her head?
- Symbiote.

20:44.932 --> 20:49.761
- Yeah. I get all its memories and stuff?
- Yeah, Dad, something like that.

20:49.731 --> 20:51.726
But I won't deceive you, sir.

20:51.811 --> 20:55.395
We have some pretty awful things
buried in our memory.

20:55.412 --> 20:56.740
Such as?

20:57.732 --> 20:59.726
Oh, memories of...

20:59.811 --> 21:02.351
...countless Goa'uld atrocities.

21:03.252 --> 21:05.246
The loss of the host before me.

21:06.452 --> 21:10.951
And you will feel
the mourning for my loss.

21:12.173 --> 21:14.166
Will you excuse me, ma'am?

21:19.174 --> 21:21.845
Oh, man... I'm sorry.

21:21.894 --> 21:28.099
I didn't want my future - I guess you could
call her "soul mate" - to see me like this.

21:28.015 --> 21:30.221
Dad, you don't have to do this.

21:30.296 --> 21:32.288
Yes, I do.

21:32.375 --> 21:35.959
My only other choice is death.
And that's not acceptable.

21:35.974 --> 21:37.719
Look,...

21:37.817 --> 21:43.523
...don't worry. It's not just hearing all that
stuff that made me sick. It's the chemo.

21:43.455 --> 21:46.411
And the trip through
that damn Stargate thing.

21:47.415 --> 21:53.670
It's OK. This is a lot of weird information
for anyone to take in. Trust me, I know.

21:55.656 --> 21:56.736
OK.

22:04.938 --> 22:07.940
<i>- Garshaw?
- What can I do for you?</i>

22:11.978 --> 22:14.517
I think you might have
a spy in your ranks.

22:14.577 --> 22:17.497
Nonsense. The Tok'ra are loyal for life.

22:17.538 --> 22:20.113
How then were you located
by the System Lords?

22:20.180 --> 22:24.179
- How did you find us?
- Well, we did have a spy in our ranks.

22:24.180 --> 22:26.968
Jolinar of Malk-shur -
through Captain Carter.

22:27.019 --> 22:30.638
I suppose you know the name of this spy?

22:30.660 --> 22:33.530
Got a pretty good idea.

22:33.578 --> 22:35.074
Who?

22:35.180 --> 22:38.515
I don't want to point fingers,
but I'd keep my eye on Cordesh.

22:38.540 --> 22:40.534
Cordesh? Why do you say that?

22:40.621 --> 22:45.997
You folks make a habit of walking around
with those little tele-ball... What are they?

22:45.941 --> 22:49.441
- Long-range communications devices.
- We don't have those.

22:49.461 --> 22:52.665
We have no use for them.
The system is not secure.

22:52.701 --> 22:54.693
Well, your buddy Cordesh has one.

22:56.101 --> 22:57.477
Tok'ra kree!

22:57.582 --> 22:59.326
<i>Kree!</i>

22:59.422 --> 23:01.414
Tajak Cordesh kree!

23:01.502 --> 23:04.040
<i>- Tullah kree!
- You guys stay here.</i>

23:07.862 --> 23:09.855
We'll stay here.

23:12.942 --> 23:16.776
Cordesh! You must come with me
and face questioning.

23:17.303 --> 23:19.795
<i>I am not what I appear to be.</i>

23:19.863 --> 23:21.855
Cordesh is no longer.

23:23.384 --> 23:27.086
I couldn't stop him.
I'm as guilty as he was!

23:27.104 --> 23:30.271
You must leave the tunnel
and explain yourself, Cordesh.

23:31.263 --> 23:34.550
I don't deserve
to remain among the Tok'ra.

23:34.584 --> 23:36.162
Agh!

23:41.304 --> 23:43.213
Ouch!

23:48.265 --> 23:49.843
OK.

23:50.865 --> 23:52.858
What do I have to do?

23:53.384 --> 23:56.090
First, Selmak would like to interview you.

23:56.144 --> 23:57.141
Huh?

23:58.106 --> 24:01.772
<i>If I am to spend
the next hundred or more years...</i>

24:01.787 --> 24:03.779
...with you as my host,...

24:04.346 --> 24:08.760
...do you not think I have the right
to decide if I even like you?

24:10.346 --> 24:13.681
What's not to like?
Just ask my daughter, I'm a teddy bear.

24:13.707 --> 24:16.199
Oh, yeah. Real teddy bear.

24:16.268 --> 24:18.806
How do you feel about the Goa'uld?

24:20.147 --> 24:22.900
Well, you're the first one I've met.

24:23.386 --> 24:25.844
I am not a Goa'uld!

24:25.907 --> 24:28.863
- Ah. Trick question?
- Remember, Dad...

24:28.909 --> 24:31.317
I tried to explain the difference.

24:31.388 --> 24:35.802
Right. I apologise. I guess
I've never met a Goa'uld before.

24:35.788 --> 24:39.538
From what Sam and her people tell me,
I don't think I'd like them much.

24:47.069 --> 24:50.320
Tell me, sir, are you a good man?

24:53.710 --> 24:56.546
- You're kidding, right?
- No.

24:56.589 --> 24:59.757
We'll be spending
the rest of our lives together.

24:59.789 --> 25:01.451
Look...

25:01.550 --> 25:03.794
Forgive me for being blunt,...

25:06.832 --> 25:08.825
...but you're dying, right?

25:08.911 --> 25:11.153
<i>My host is, yes.</i>

25:11.230 --> 25:16.309
And you'll die with her unless you and I...
What did you call it? Blend, right?

25:16.991 --> 25:20.326
- Yes.
- And I'll die, too, unless we do this.

25:20.991 --> 25:25.904
So good man, bad man - what difference
does it make? We don't have a choice.

25:25.872 --> 25:28.198
I don't mind telling you the whole idea...

25:28.272 --> 25:30.266
...scares the hell out of me.

25:31.032 --> 25:33.026
So, can we just get it over with?

25:35.952 --> 25:38.326
I have decided I like you.

25:39.874 --> 25:41.333
Super.

25:41.432 --> 25:44.434
But I must be sure that you understand.

25:44.473 --> 25:47.012
There will be no turning back.

25:47.074 --> 25:51.203
I cannot blend with you,
cure your disease, and leave.

25:51.194 --> 25:54.197
To do so would probably kill us both.

25:54.236 --> 25:55.943
I understand.

25:56.035 --> 26:01.910
But let me ask you something. After we do
this, will I be able to talk to my daughter?

26:01.836 --> 26:04.410
The way Saroosh talked to you, yes.

26:04.474 --> 26:07.761
But you and your daughter
must understand...

26:08.714 --> 26:11.717
...the blending may not work at all.

26:11.756 --> 26:13.749
I am very weak...

26:13.836 --> 26:16.755
...and the damage to your body...

26:16.796 --> 26:18.788
...may be too extensive.

26:20.036 --> 26:23.240
In other words, we might die anyway.

26:23.277 --> 26:24.936
Yes.

26:32.637 --> 26:34.881
Then can you give me five with my kid?

26:34.958 --> 26:36.701
Of course.

26:41.557 --> 26:44.096
We must hurry.
We don't have a lot of time.

26:45.519 --> 26:47.558
Listen, Sam...

26:48.878 --> 26:50.872
I was never good at this stuff.

26:50.960 --> 26:55.173
- Dad, you don't have to say anything.
- You gotta know one thing...

26:55.160 --> 26:57.615
How proud I am of you.

26:57.679 --> 26:59.837
I'm not good at saying that enough.

26:59.920 --> 27:02.126
I think you just said it pretty well.

27:02.200 --> 27:05.865
Even when I thought you were
this whiz satellite geek,...

27:07.200 --> 27:09.526
...I was proud.

27:11.039 --> 27:13.116
That's all I want to say.

27:13.200 --> 27:15.193
Thanks, Dad.

27:17.481 --> 27:20.567
Hey! I know I'm a pain in the ass!

27:22.082 --> 27:25.914
Maybe this Tok'ra lady
will sand off some of the rough edges.

27:25.922 --> 27:28.758
- It might be a good thing, right?
- Could be.

27:29.961 --> 27:32.750
But the longer we wait,
the less the chances.

27:35.162 --> 27:37.154
OK, what do I do?

27:38.201 --> 27:41.572
Cordesh must be guilty or he would
not have allowed himself to die.

27:41.602 --> 27:43.892
- He had a choice?
- I must thank you.

27:43.962 --> 27:46.633
You may have saved the Tok'ra
a great many losses.

27:46.682 --> 27:48.260
You're welcome.

27:48.363 --> 27:52.278
- But you still have nothing to offer us.
- What?!

27:52.284 --> 27:55.404
- Well, actually, I think we do.
- Do we?

27:55.443 --> 27:58.612
The one thing you need most
we could provide - hosts.

27:58.643 --> 28:00.185
Daniel?

28:00.285 --> 28:06.039
Well, if it works for Sam's father, there
must be other people in similar situations.

28:08.204 --> 28:10.198
It's worth exploring.

28:10.285 --> 28:12.278
It is.

28:20.165 --> 28:23.665
<i>We do not enter our host
through the back of the neck.</i>

28:23.685 --> 28:26.521
This leaves a scar
that many of us find very unsettling.

28:26.566 --> 28:30.019
- Why don't the Goa'uld do this?
- So they don't remember the horror...

28:30.046 --> 28:33.131
...on their host's face
whenever they look in a mirror.

28:33.165 --> 28:35.409
You must step away, Captain Carter.

28:37.885 --> 28:39.962
Goodbye, kid.

28:40.046 --> 28:42.039
See you soon, Dad.

28:46.047 --> 28:47.755
Ahem.

28:47.847 --> 28:49.842
Now what?

28:49.927 --> 28:52.051
<i>Kiss me.</i>

28:52.127 --> 28:54.618
You're kidding, right?

28:56.048 --> 28:58.088
No, I'm not.

29:04.009 --> 29:05.586
Agh!

29:21.529 --> 29:23.605
<i>Goodbye, dear friend.</i>

29:30.930 --> 29:32.342
He's alive.

29:37.290 --> 29:38.572
Is he OK?

29:39.290 --> 29:42.210
He's very sick and Selmak is weak.

29:42.251 --> 29:44.789
She may not have
the strength to heal him.

29:44.852 --> 29:47.259
Is there anything we can do to help?

29:48.692 --> 29:51.314
Nothing. Only time will tell.

29:54.052 --> 29:57.304
<i>The Goa'uld ships
are dropping from hyperspace.</i>

29:57.333 --> 29:59.491
They will start attacking within hours.

29:59.573 --> 30:02.243
Garshaw orders that
we must destroy the complex.

30:02.292 --> 30:04.333
We need time!

30:04.413 --> 30:07.367
- Can we move him?
- If we do so, it will kill them.

30:26.214 --> 30:27.959
Excuse me.

30:32.535 --> 30:34.113
What are you doing?

30:35.855 --> 30:38.692
I'll apologise if I'm wrong.

30:43.056 --> 30:45.048
Cordesh had one of these.

30:47.895 --> 30:49.888
So there are two spies.

30:51.655 --> 30:53.233
Or not.

30:54.336 --> 30:57.209
Cordesh said he wasn't
who he appeared to be.

30:57.257 --> 31:00.757
Goa'uld can jump host to hide,
much as Jolinar of Malk-shur.

31:00.778 --> 31:02.319
Cordesh?

31:03.376 --> 31:07.423
<i>The plague that is the Tok'ra
will soon be wiped out!</i>

31:07.417 --> 31:09.957
To think I once called you
my friend, Cordesh!

31:10.017 --> 31:13.304
But I want you to know...
the System Lords will fall,...

31:13.337 --> 31:15.378
...but you won't be alive to see it.

31:15.459 --> 31:19.125
Attempt to remove Cordesh
from the host without harming her.

31:19.138 --> 31:22.473
And put this traitor
in one of the vanishing tunnels!

31:30.380 --> 31:33.416
I believe I shall be...
proud to call you friend.

31:38.619 --> 31:39.817
Ahem.

31:52.020 --> 31:56.601
<i>Martouf, all tunnels but this
one and the escape tunnel have vanished.</i>

31:56.582 --> 31:59.951
All the other Tok'ra have gone to
the new home world. We must go.

31:59.981 --> 32:03.398
- What about my father?
- When and if he awakens...

32:03.422 --> 32:05.829
...Selmak knows where we'll be.
He can follow.

32:05.902 --> 32:09.022
- But the Goa'uld will capture him.
- If he's captured,...

32:09.063 --> 32:11.933
...he will die before he will
reveal our whereabouts.

32:11.982 --> 32:14.226
- Then take him with you.
- Or we'll take him.

32:14.301 --> 32:18.003
To transport him now, he will die.
He needs to remain stationary...

32:18.021 --> 32:20.809
...until Selmak has completed her repairs.

32:20.864 --> 32:24.150
- We can't just leave him here!
- I will remain with him.

32:24.183 --> 32:26.223
If I can get him out, I will. If not,...

32:26.303 --> 32:31.012
...I will allow the vanishing tunnels to
consume us before the Goa'uld get here.

32:30.983 --> 32:33.356
You cannot die in this way.
We must leave now!

32:33.423 --> 32:35.832
- I'll stay.
- You are even more vulnerable...

32:35.903 --> 32:38.776
...since you contain
the memories of Jolinar.

32:39.585 --> 32:42.076
I cannot allow you to stay.
We must go now.

32:43.384 --> 32:47.171
- She's right, Captain. We have to go.
- With respect,...

32:47.184 --> 32:49.936
...no, sir. I am not leaving him here.

32:51.226 --> 32:56.138
<i>We will both remain. I will assure
that we will not be taken by the Goa'uld.</i>

32:56.105 --> 32:57.766
<i>Please, Colonel.</i>

32:59.145 --> 33:01.019
I need to be here.

33:03.945 --> 33:06.021
Right. Daniel. Teal'c.

33:06.106 --> 33:07.566
Let's go.

33:18.987 --> 33:23.200
We may not have much time before the
Goa'uld come through and block our gate.

33:23.188 --> 33:26.190
<i>We can take you to Earth
and send you on from there.</i>

33:26.228 --> 33:29.098
Daniel, start dialling home.

33:29.148 --> 33:31.557
<i>- What about Carter?
- O'Neill!</i>

33:36.909 --> 33:38.568
Dial!

34:11.030 --> 34:14.199
I hope I've done the right thing
bringing him here.

34:14.231 --> 34:17.483
From what I understand,
the alternative was no better.

34:18.431 --> 34:19.842
True.

34:26.112 --> 34:29.777
<i>- Can your man defend them in an attack?
- Only minimally.</i>

34:29.793 --> 34:34.420
Garshaw, what will Martouf do
if the Goa'uld get too close?

34:34.393 --> 34:39.222
At the risk of capture, Martouf will
destroy the underground compound...

34:39.193 --> 34:41.601
...with himself and all your people with it.

34:49.594 --> 34:50.672
Dad?

34:52.233 --> 34:53.811
<i>Martouf?</i>

34:55.594 --> 34:57.588
I am here.

35:00.835 --> 35:03.161
Shall we not make our escape?

35:04.594 --> 35:08.130
- Yes, we should.
- Is my dad in there somewhere?

35:12.195 --> 35:13.773
<i>I'm here, Sam.</i>

35:15.155 --> 35:16.530
Oh, man!

35:16.635 --> 35:19.306
Talk about your hangover!

35:19.356 --> 35:22.856
- How are you, Dad?
- Awful. Headache the size of Kuwait.

35:22.876 --> 35:25.414
There's too much stuff in here.

35:25.476 --> 35:26.972
- Whoa!
- What?

35:29.677 --> 35:31.835
No more arthritis!

35:31.916 --> 35:33.911
Holy Hannah! No more arthritis!

35:36.717 --> 35:39.922
We should leave as soon as possible.
This way.

36:04.239 --> 36:06.280
<i>Still no SG-1 signal, sir.</i>

36:24.760 --> 36:27.550
Goa'uld are attempting
to come through the gate.

36:27.601 --> 36:29.594
Not if I dial out first.

36:31.641 --> 36:35.688
We'll go to Earth. You two can go
wherever you need to from there.

36:44.282 --> 36:46.275
Did we open the gate or did they?

36:46.362 --> 36:49.068
<i>We have no choice.</i>

36:52.443 --> 36:53.523
Wait.

36:55.443 --> 36:57.438
<i>There's the signal.</i>

36:58.523 --> 37:00.516
Open the iris.

37:32.887 --> 37:34.963
<i>I must give you thanks.</i>

37:35.047 --> 37:37.835
You have saved my life
and that of my new host.

37:37.887 --> 37:40.804
<i>- We thank you.
- This is wonderful news.</i>

37:41.887 --> 37:44.889
Yes. Can we talk to your host?

37:50.726 --> 37:52.304
Ahem.

37:52.407 --> 37:56.193
So when the little fella inside me's talking,
do I sound like she does?

37:56.208 --> 37:59.827
<i>- That is correct.
- That's strange.</i>

37:59.847 --> 38:03.550
I can feel myself talking,
but it's not me saying the words.

38:04.327 --> 38:07.414
- You know?
- Don't know. Take your word for it.

38:07.449 --> 38:09.905
How do you feel?

38:09.969 --> 38:11.344
Well,...

38:11.449 --> 38:15.780
...considering I got one of those things
inside me, pretty damn good!

38:15.768 --> 38:18.342
Listen, George...

38:18.409 --> 38:20.947
Because of this blending thing...

38:21.009 --> 38:25.719
...I already know everything
there is to know about the Tok'ra.

38:26.769 --> 38:28.597
You made the right call.

38:29.809 --> 38:31.887
I hope so.

38:31.969 --> 38:36.467
I would be proud to serve as liaison
between the Earth and these people.

38:37.210 --> 38:38.621
Good.

38:38.730 --> 38:43.643
On that note, perhaps you can ask them
to come with me to do a little debriefing.

38:43.610 --> 38:45.900
I'm afraid we cannot. We must go.

38:47.251 --> 38:49.161
You are safe here.

38:49.251 --> 38:53.166
Because of the spy, the Goa'uld may
be at the site the Tok'ra have moved to.

38:53.172 --> 38:54.547
You can't stay?

38:54.652 --> 38:57.487
No, we must stop the tunnels
before they are grown.

38:57.532 --> 39:03.405
We must move the Tok'ra to yet another
new home. Do you have a dialling device?

39:03.333 --> 39:06.952
Yeah, we slapped a little one together.

39:06.972 --> 39:09.465
Hm. You made it yourself.

39:09.532 --> 39:12.617
Impressive. Will you show it to me?

39:12.652 --> 39:15.525
I would like to put in
the coordinates myself.

39:16.454 --> 39:18.032
This way.

39:19.893 --> 39:24.771
I give you my word, I will watch over
your father as if he were my own.

39:24.733 --> 39:26.063
Thank you.

39:26.175 --> 39:29.876
- I look forward to seeing you again.
- So do I.

39:33.775 --> 39:35.603
It's ironic, ain't it?

39:35.695 --> 39:37.070
What?

39:37.175 --> 39:39.632
I was trying to find you
a better assignment.

39:39.695 --> 39:43.563
Now you've found me the best one
an old soldier could dream up.

39:43.574 --> 39:45.568
Thanks, kid.

39:46.215 --> 39:48.173
You're welcome.

39:49.257 --> 39:52.259
- Do you have to go so soon?
- Yeah, I have to go.

39:52.297 --> 39:54.289
Apparently,...

39:54.376 --> 39:56.998
...I'm the oldest and wisest among us.

39:57.976 --> 39:59.222
Oh, jeez!

40:08.538 --> 40:13.451
One day, the Tok'ra and the Tauri people
will destroy the Goa'uld System Lords.

40:13.418 --> 40:15.708
This will be a good day.

40:19.699 --> 40:22.320
This box has a signature in it
we can recognise.

40:22.378 --> 40:25.583
Send it through the gate
and we'll know you want to contact us.

40:25.617 --> 40:27.197
Thank you.

40:28.059 --> 40:29.684
Come, Selmak.

40:30.858 --> 40:33.018
I love you.

40:33.099 --> 40:35.507
I love you, too, Dad.

40:40.539 --> 40:44.409
Oh, Selmak says...
Let me see if I can translate this.

40:44.420 --> 40:46.413
Don't call us,...

40:46.500 --> 40:48.079
...we'll call you.
