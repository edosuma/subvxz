WEBVTT

00:03.539 --> 00:07.809
"Carlos Garcia, acute abdominal pain,
right lower quadrant."

00:07.843 --> 00:09.928
Just came in from the airport...
emergency landing.

00:09.979 --> 00:10.929
Dr. Miller.

00:10.980 --> 00:11.930
Uh...

00:11.981 --> 00:13.348
Go. I got this.

00:13.382 --> 00:16.101
Okay.

00:16.152 --> 00:19.387
Mr. Garcia, I'm Dr. Reid.
I'm a surgical resident.

00:19.405 --> 00:20.388
Hey.

00:20.406 --> 00:21.722
You're feeling some pain?

00:21.740 --> 00:23.858
A little bit, yeah.

00:23.892 --> 00:26.694
Do you mind lifting up
your shirt for me, please?

00:26.728 --> 00:28.329
Now this might be
a little tender, all right?

00:29.731 --> 00:32.333
- Looks to me like a ruptured appendix.
- And you are...

00:32.368 --> 00:34.735
Mark Wilson. I'm a G.P.
I was on the same flight.

00:34.753 --> 00:36.121
You got off the plane with him?

00:36.172 --> 00:39.541
Yeah, well, I wanted to see
it through, do the hand-off.

00:39.575 --> 00:42.910
Oh!

00:42.928 --> 00:45.296
We'll start him on a liter of ringers

00:45.347 --> 00:47.682
and 80 milligrams gentamicin.

00:47.716 --> 00:49.750
You're having trouble breathing, Carlos?

00:49.768 --> 00:52.753
Chest cold. Got it last week.

00:52.771 --> 00:56.474
Just try to sit forward for me
a little bit, please. Thank you.

00:56.525 --> 00:57.475
Mm-hmm.

00:57.526 --> 00:58.560
And just one deep breath.

01:00.429 --> 01:02.063
Okay.

01:03.115 --> 01:04.649
You're a little wheezy.

01:04.700 --> 01:06.568
His temp is up to 103.

01:06.602 --> 01:08.319
It's been steadily climbing.

01:08.370 --> 01:10.071
Dr. Wilson is right.

01:10.105 --> 01:11.990
You probably have a ruptured appendix.

01:12.041 --> 01:13.491
There are signs of peritonitis,

01:13.542 --> 01:15.943
but I won't know for
sure till I'm in there.

01:15.961 --> 01:17.545
We're going to get you
straight into surgery, okay?

01:17.563 --> 01:18.446
Okay.

01:18.464 --> 01:20.331
Great.

01:20.382 --> 01:23.585
Listen, um, mind if I stick around?

01:23.619 --> 01:25.253
My flight's not for another six hours.

01:25.287 --> 01:26.588
I'd kind of like to see this through.

01:26.622 --> 01:27.972
Sure. I'll come and find you.

01:28.007 --> 01:28.973
Thanks.

01:30.593 --> 01:35.230
Imaging, and to the O.R.
Fast, okay? Thanks.

01:35.264 --> 01:36.514
Imagine that Charlie's a car

01:36.565 --> 01:38.516
that's been parked in
the garage all winter.

01:38.567 --> 01:40.568
Technically, everything's in working order,

01:40.603 --> 01:43.471
but for some unknown reason,
he's refusing to start.

01:43.489 --> 01:45.073
Just needs a boost.

01:45.107 --> 01:47.775
Never fails... any time
physical labor's involved,

01:47.809 --> 01:49.777
Shahir just disappears.

01:49.811 --> 01:50.811
What is that?

01:50.829 --> 01:53.314
Transcranial magnetic stimulation.

01:53.332 --> 01:55.149
A little juice in the old caboose.

01:55.167 --> 01:56.751
- You're serious?
- I am.

01:56.785 --> 01:58.503
It delivers alternating and pulsing

01:58.537 --> 02:01.206
electromagnetic field to
Charlie's prefrontal cortex.

02:01.257 --> 02:03.291
Best-case scenario, he wakes up.

02:03.325 --> 02:05.293
Worst-case scenario, he has a seizure.

02:05.327 --> 02:07.512
Don't worry. We'll keep
the frequency low to start.

02:07.546 --> 02:08.713
And right on cue.

02:08.764 --> 02:10.931
Thank you, Shahir,
for all your excellent help.

02:10.966 --> 02:13.384
Please disregard Victor's tone.
We're having a disagreement.

02:13.435 --> 02:15.220
He's seeing his mother tonight,
and he didn't invite me.

02:15.254 --> 02:16.721
Didn't even tell me she was in town.

02:16.772 --> 02:18.473
Which is really not a big deal, Victor.

02:18.507 --> 02:22.977
I have never met his mother...
in almost two years, not once...

02:23.011 --> 02:25.396
but yeah, no, that's not a big deal.

02:28.450 --> 02:31.536
I'm sorry. That was inappropriate.

02:31.570 --> 02:33.238
Only slightly.

02:36.125 --> 02:38.576
Okay. I'm sorry. I gotta go. Can you...

02:38.627 --> 02:39.577
Yeah, no problem.

02:39.628 --> 02:41.379
Thank you.

02:44.667 --> 02:49.203
Okay. If I'm stuck...
maybe this will unstick me.

02:49.221 --> 02:52.707
So last Thursday,
I was convinced I had a glioma.

02:52.725 --> 02:54.375
This week, it's skin cancer.

02:54.393 --> 02:56.544
I'm just paranoid.
Tell me I'm just paranoid.

02:56.562 --> 02:59.397
Medical student's disease...
I had it in med school.

02:59.431 --> 03:01.882
Thought I had periodontitis,
athlete's foot,

03:01.900 --> 03:03.234
seasonal disaffective disorder.

03:03.269 --> 03:04.819
Yeah, none of those can kill you, though.

03:04.853 --> 03:08.106
All right. Let's see
this suspicious freckle.

03:08.157 --> 03:09.857
It's probably just sunburn, right?

03:09.891 --> 03:11.809
I don't know. I want to
get out the bucket list.

03:11.844 --> 03:15.246
Shut up. You're in psych.
What do you know?

03:15.297 --> 03:18.049
Maggie. Hey. Have you,
um... This is Hannah.

03:18.083 --> 03:19.050
Hi.

03:19.084 --> 03:20.701
Hey.

03:20.719 --> 03:22.837
So I'll see you later?

03:22.871 --> 03:26.707
You will, unless I die of
a malignant melanoma. Mm!

03:28.710 --> 03:29.978
She seems fun.

03:30.012 --> 03:32.680
Yeah. She is. She's-she's super fun.

03:32.714 --> 03:35.333
I'm happy for you, Gav... seeing someone.

03:35.367 --> 03:39.103
Seeing someone? No.
Hannah and I... we're just friends.

03:39.154 --> 03:41.105
Super.

03:43.192 --> 03:44.275
No C.T.?

03:44.326 --> 03:45.559
It was backed up...

03:45.577 --> 03:48.329
And the ultrasound's murky. Look at that.

03:48.364 --> 03:49.530
Oh.

03:49.564 --> 03:51.366
No known allergies,

03:51.400 --> 03:54.568
no history of heart or lung disease...
piece of cake.

03:54.586 --> 03:56.704
Hey, so Charlie's doing better.

03:56.738 --> 03:57.705
Touch wood.

03:57.739 --> 03:59.507
Heard about the T.M.S.

03:59.541 --> 04:02.076
There have been studies. It might work.

04:02.094 --> 04:03.511
You're impressive, Reid.

04:03.545 --> 04:06.631
You've never given up on Charlie.
I admire that.

04:14.473 --> 04:15.890
Do you have a second?

04:15.924 --> 04:16.891
I do not.

04:16.925 --> 04:19.593
Hey. I want to be friends again.

04:20.946 --> 04:23.481
I'm sorry I made it weird.

04:23.532 --> 04:24.732
Okay.

04:24.766 --> 04:25.733
Okay?

04:25.768 --> 04:26.767
Yes.

04:26.785 --> 04:28.036
Stop avoiding me?

04:29.071 --> 04:30.788
Dr. Pratt needs help.

04:33.792 --> 04:35.243
Spoke too soon?

04:35.277 --> 04:37.829
I keep losing sight of the cords.
Give me some burp.

04:37.880 --> 04:39.280
I got it.

04:39.298 --> 04:40.481
Sats are falling. You gotta bag him.

04:40.516 --> 04:41.833
No, I don't, not yet.

04:41.884 --> 04:43.000
That's it. Right there. Hold that.

04:43.052 --> 04:44.001
Okay.

04:44.053 --> 04:46.087
Tube.

04:53.462 --> 04:54.579
Easy.

04:54.613 --> 04:57.181
It's okay. It's just reflex. Little more.

04:58.233 --> 04:59.851
Okay, use the stylet.

04:59.902 --> 05:00.935
Quiet.

05:03.489 --> 05:05.590
Nearly there.

05:05.624 --> 05:07.141
That's it.

05:07.159 --> 05:08.142
I got it.

05:08.160 --> 05:09.143
That's nicely done.

05:09.161 --> 05:11.446
Out.

05:11.480 --> 05:13.614
Okay. See you later.

05:15.250 --> 05:16.501
There we go.

05:16.535 --> 05:19.087
Okay. Volumes are coming back up.
We're good to go.

05:19.121 --> 05:20.388
All right. I have to scrub in.

05:20.406 --> 05:22.156
Get him prepped, and have
suction and irrigation ready,

05:22.174 --> 05:23.758
'cause if his appendix is already blown,

05:23.792 --> 05:24.759
he's gonna be full of pus.

05:24.793 --> 05:26.494
Okay.

05:26.512 --> 05:29.964
I'm far too young to get spinal
stenosis. I looked it up.

05:29.998 --> 05:32.133
Normally, people are in their 60s.

05:32.167 --> 05:34.936
It's just bad luck, pure and simple.

05:34.970 --> 05:36.521
There's no other explanation.

05:36.555 --> 05:39.524
And if you had to rate your pain today,
on a scale of one to ten,

05:39.558 --> 05:40.674
what would it be?

05:40.692 --> 05:41.692
17.

05:42.778 --> 05:44.678
I'm kidding. It's ten.

05:44.696 --> 05:45.780
Okay.

05:45.814 --> 05:47.598
On the other hand,
today is an auspicious day.

05:47.633 --> 05:50.618
It's my mother's birthday...
may she rest in peace...

05:51.094 --> 05:53.488
and the numbers in the day add up to 25,

05:53.522 --> 05:55.456
which is the day my cat was born, so...

05:55.491 --> 05:56.457
Mm.

05:56.492 --> 05:57.458
June 25th.

05:57.493 --> 05:58.459
Lucky.

05:58.494 --> 05:59.994
It is. I'm encouraged.

06:00.028 --> 06:01.662
Good morning, Carol.
How are you doing?

06:01.696 --> 06:03.297
I'm a little anxious.

06:03.332 --> 06:04.465
Of course you are.

06:04.500 --> 06:07.135
That's perfectly normal. Dr. Lin.

06:07.169 --> 06:08.419
This is Carol Malone.

06:08.470 --> 06:10.805
She's in for a posterior
lumbar decompression

06:10.839 --> 06:12.557
to treat her spinal stenosis.

06:12.591 --> 06:14.208
She has multiple disc herniations

06:14.226 --> 06:15.593
impinging on her nerve roots,

06:15.644 --> 06:16.978
which is causing pain in her legs.

06:17.012 --> 06:18.312
Ten out of ten.

06:18.347 --> 06:19.313
And treatment?

06:19.348 --> 06:20.932
Spinal decompression.

06:24.686 --> 06:26.187
Uh, okay.

06:26.221 --> 06:28.940
So, Carol, uh, we've already
talked about what's gonna happen

06:28.991 --> 06:31.292
with your surgery.
What I'd like to address is...

06:31.326 --> 06:35.029
Excuse me, Dr. Goran.
May I ask you...

06:35.063 --> 06:39.300
When you say the words,
"surgery," or "pain,"

06:39.334 --> 06:41.953
would you mind repeating them three times?

06:42.004 --> 06:45.239
Carol's a little superstitious.

06:45.257 --> 06:49.327
I know... it sounds crazy,
but I've had so much bad luck,

06:49.361 --> 06:52.463
that, at this point,
I'm willing to do whatever it takes.

06:52.514 --> 06:55.550
Of course. Um...

06:55.584 --> 06:59.086
So when I do your surgery surgery
surgery...

06:59.104 --> 07:03.691
I'd like to address the issue
of your pain pain pain,

07:03.725 --> 07:06.978
by making more room for your spinal cord.

07:07.012 --> 07:08.346
Thank you.

07:11.450 --> 07:15.786
So I was thinking, this weekend,
you and I... we get out of town,

07:15.821 --> 07:18.005
maybe take a little
field trip of our own...

07:18.040 --> 07:20.908
Some b&b, maybe a spa?

07:20.942 --> 07:22.760
Can you make sure you check
Carol's imaging and bloodwork,

07:22.811 --> 07:23.944
including the coagulation profile?

07:23.962 --> 07:25.279
Yep.

07:25.297 --> 07:27.331
She was really scared,
and you made her feel comfortable.

07:27.382 --> 07:29.834
You're a good guy, Joel.

07:29.885 --> 07:31.752
So what do you say?

07:31.786 --> 07:32.753
About...

07:32.787 --> 07:33.921
About going away this weekend.

07:33.955 --> 07:34.922
Okay, listen to me, Maggie.

07:34.956 --> 07:36.140
What? What is it?

07:36.174 --> 07:37.308
When we're doing rounds,

07:37.342 --> 07:38.776
I ask you to describe
me a surgical treatment,

07:38.827 --> 07:40.961
I want you to give me more
than a couple of words.

07:40.979 --> 07:42.466
"Spinal decompression"...
that doesn't cut it.

07:42.513 --> 07:43.231
Okay.

07:43.327 --> 07:45.332
I expect you to walk me
through the procedure, step-by-step.

07:45.367 --> 07:46.901
Anything else you'd like to share?

07:46.935 --> 07:50.738
You're the one who's always
asking me for feedback. Okay?

07:52.241 --> 07:53.974
Oh.

07:55.160 --> 07:57.945
Regarding the, uh,
the-the weekend thing...

07:57.979 --> 08:00.581
I'm sorry. I'm not gonna
be able to get away.

08:08.156 --> 08:10.458
Okay. Blunt nose grasper.

08:17.966 --> 08:19.833
That is not what I expected.

08:19.851 --> 08:22.136
I have a visual on the appendix,
and it looks...

08:22.170 --> 08:23.604
totally fine.

08:23.639 --> 08:25.773
It's not even inflamed, let alone ruptured.

08:25.807 --> 08:27.725
Can you just look around
a little bit more, please?

08:29.311 --> 08:32.780
No diverticulitis, no purulent fluid...

08:32.813 --> 08:34.649
So what's causing the symptoms?

08:34.683 --> 08:36.284
That is an excellent question.

08:36.318 --> 08:38.068
He's got a distended loop of bowel,

08:38.120 --> 08:39.169
maybe a site of infection.

08:40.371 --> 08:41.455
I'm having trouble ventilating.

08:41.490 --> 08:42.856
Sat's down to 82.

08:42.874 --> 08:44.659
B.P.'s falling. Pulse erratic.

08:44.693 --> 08:46.527
He's crashing. Are you losing blood?

08:46.545 --> 08:48.529
No, nothing. What the hell is happening?

08:48.547 --> 08:50.214
Did you check his creatinine levels?

08:50.248 --> 08:53.134
Yeah, it was fine... 1:10.
His electrolytes were fine.

08:53.168 --> 08:55.419
His gases were all fine at induction.
Check his lines.

08:55.470 --> 08:56.837
They're good. They're fine.

08:57.872 --> 08:59.006
He's coding.

08:59.040 --> 09:02.677
Push amioderone. Start defib.
Start the clock.

09:02.711 --> 09:05.146
Let's lose the drape.

09:05.180 --> 09:06.430
Charge to 300.

09:06.481 --> 09:07.431
300.

09:07.482 --> 09:08.432
All right.

09:09.484 --> 09:10.434
Clear.

09:12.721 --> 09:13.688
No change.

09:13.722 --> 09:15.055
I got it, I got it.

09:15.073 --> 09:17.825
Sat's are bottoming out. 50 and dropping.

09:17.859 --> 09:20.361
B.P. 60 over 40.

09:20.395 --> 09:22.229
Oh, come on. Why is this happening?

09:22.247 --> 09:23.447
No sinus rhythm.

09:23.498 --> 09:24.832
Did you check to see if the tube is in?

09:24.866 --> 09:25.899
Did you check the cords?

09:25.917 --> 09:27.535
Yes. You must have hit an artery.

09:27.569 --> 09:28.536
300.

09:29.904 --> 09:31.872
Clear.

09:33.542 --> 09:34.508
No change.

09:36.244 --> 09:37.878
Are we ready yet?

09:37.912 --> 09:38.879
300.

09:40.915 --> 09:41.966
Clear!

09:43.018 --> 09:46.253
Come on, Garcia. Push epi!

09:46.271 --> 09:47.254
Still no change.

09:47.272 --> 09:50.274
Come on!

10:06.107 --> 10:08.325
Time of death... 2:04 P.M.

10:23.859 --> 10:26.027
I went in laparoscopically.
I saw no sign of rupture.

10:26.062 --> 10:27.979
He had minor bowel distension.

10:28.030 --> 10:29.564
Crashed on the table, huh?

10:29.598 --> 10:33.318
We couldn't oxygenate him.
I pushed amioderone, full defib.

10:33.352 --> 10:34.636
B.P. was low when he came in.

10:34.670 --> 10:36.955
Yeah, that's right,
and his lungs were heavy.

10:36.989 --> 10:40.675
My guess... an aggressive
bacterial pneumonia.

10:40.709 --> 10:43.828
It doesn't fit with his G.I. symptoms.

10:43.863 --> 10:46.614
But like you said, an infection,
maybe an underlying flu.

10:46.632 --> 10:49.250
Mm-hmm. I agree with Dr. Miller.

10:49.284 --> 10:51.836
Let's notify the family.

10:51.887 --> 10:53.171
I'm gonna need the usual paperwork...

10:53.222 --> 10:54.672
full step-by-step from both of you.

11:04.967 --> 11:07.802
I'm waiting to establish
a baseline E.E.G.,

11:07.820 --> 11:09.804
so we can chart any variation.

11:09.822 --> 11:12.774
I'm ready. I'm pumped.
Let's let the healing begin!

11:12.808 --> 11:14.809
So this does what, exactly?

11:14.827 --> 11:16.611
Neuronal depolarization.

11:17.947 --> 11:19.480
Basically, it excites the brain.

11:19.498 --> 11:20.865
Sounds like fun.

11:20.916 --> 11:22.951
Sounds like a way out of
this freakin' penguin suit.

11:22.985 --> 11:25.620
Okay, that should be long enough.
Here we go.

11:25.654 --> 11:27.255
Wait, stop.

11:27.289 --> 11:28.673
Shouldn't we wait for Alex?

11:28.707 --> 11:31.042
I mean, what if he wakes up right now?

11:31.093 --> 11:33.161
Oh. Then he wakes up right now.

11:33.179 --> 11:34.712
Booyah.

11:39.835 --> 11:42.470
Is it working?

11:42.504 --> 11:44.439
Hmm.

11:44.473 --> 11:48.393
I absolutely have no idea.

11:49.812 --> 11:52.864
I don't feel anything.

11:56.035 --> 11:58.153
Whoa.

11:59.155 --> 12:02.356
Hello, world. I've missed you.

12:09.882 --> 12:12.584
Wait a minute. That's not right.

12:14.086 --> 12:16.571
This can't be real.

12:20.342 --> 12:22.760
There was an announcement
about an hour after takeoff...

12:22.811 --> 12:26.814
"is there a doctor on board?"
It's my first time.

12:26.849 --> 12:28.516
And you examined Mr. Garcia?

12:28.550 --> 12:31.219
Yeah. He was short of breath.
Abdominal cramps, fever...

12:31.237 --> 12:32.520
Coughing?

12:32.555 --> 12:33.738
He said he had a cold,

12:33.772 --> 12:35.006
but he just seemed to be getting worse,

12:35.040 --> 12:37.275
so I convinced them to land the plane.

12:37.309 --> 12:39.210
Did he happen to mention where
he'd been traveling at all?

12:39.245 --> 12:42.530
We didn't talk much.
He was in a lot of pain, so...

12:42.564 --> 12:44.249
Okay.

12:47.369 --> 12:48.336
Deep breath.

12:49.404 --> 12:50.755
Honestly, I...

12:50.789 --> 12:54.509
I'm just a little tired.
It's probably just jet lag.

12:54.543 --> 12:55.510
And again.

13:00.249 --> 13:03.101
Dr. Wilson, you've got wheezes,
shallow breathing,

13:03.135 --> 13:04.852
And your temp is pushing 102.

13:04.887 --> 13:06.020
Really?

13:06.055 --> 13:07.588
I'm gonna order an X-ray, okay?

13:07.606 --> 13:08.923
I don't have pneumonia.

13:08.941 --> 13:09.924
Let's just be sure.

13:13.646 --> 13:15.396
Just excuse me for a minute.

13:15.430 --> 13:16.698
Sure.

13:19.268 --> 13:23.071
Hey.
I found Garcia's boarding passes.

13:23.105 --> 13:24.706
He flew out of Mumbai yesterday morning,

13:24.740 --> 13:26.374
transferring in Frankfurt.

13:26.408 --> 13:27.575
We should check with promed.

13:27.609 --> 13:29.661
I did. This was posted 40 minutes ago.

13:29.712 --> 13:32.080
The W.H.O. identified
a cluster of coronavirus

13:32.114 --> 13:34.832
in a village outside of Mumbai.

13:34.883 --> 13:36.784
Coronavirus... like S.A.R.S.

13:36.802 --> 13:38.286
Yeah.

13:38.304 --> 13:43.258
So, uh, let's just get him
into isolation till we're sure.

13:43.292 --> 13:44.425
Yeah.

13:44.459 --> 13:45.593
Okay.

13:48.397 --> 13:52.100
Oh, man. That does not
look like a good sign.

13:52.134 --> 13:54.936
We think you may have
been exposed to a virus,

13:54.970 --> 13:57.155
but it's just a precaution,
okay? So don't worry.

13:58.824 --> 14:00.474
Or try not to.

14:04.613 --> 14:08.316
Carol has disc herniations at L4, 5.

14:08.334 --> 14:10.535
You can see them compressing
at the L4 nerve root.

14:10.586 --> 14:12.170
What is the next step?

14:12.204 --> 14:13.171
Retract the nerve root.

14:13.205 --> 14:14.589
Mm-hmm. And then?

14:14.623 --> 14:16.657
Grasp the disc material and remove it.

14:16.675 --> 14:18.259
So go ahead. Extract the root.

14:18.294 --> 14:20.044
Retractor.

14:21.964 --> 14:28.002
Yep. That's it. Steady.
Steady. Okay. Pituitary.

14:28.020 --> 14:29.721
Thank you.

14:31.056 --> 14:34.008
So what are we worried about here?
What are the dangers?

14:34.026 --> 14:35.009
There are so many.

14:35.027 --> 14:36.010
Mm-hmm.

14:36.028 --> 14:37.011
You could tear the dura

14:37.029 --> 14:38.346
and cause a C.S.F. leak.

14:38.364 --> 14:41.316
You could nick an epidural vein.
Ooh. Worst case?

14:42.118 --> 14:44.702
You could avulse a nerve
root and cause paralysis.

14:44.737 --> 14:48.156
With Carol's luck,
you'll probably do all three.

14:48.190 --> 14:51.626
With Carol's luck,
you'll probably do all three.

14:53.462 --> 14:55.163
Tough crowd.

14:55.197 --> 14:57.632
Okay. Irrigation.

14:59.635 --> 15:01.219
I'm working three double shifts next week.

15:01.253 --> 15:02.470
How does that even happen?

15:02.504 --> 15:04.422
Victor. Hi.

15:04.473 --> 15:06.207
We need to talk about
our previous conversation.

15:06.225 --> 15:07.992
What are you still doing here?
I thought you went home.

15:08.026 --> 15:09.643
Okay, so the reason why I don't invite you

15:09.661 --> 15:10.728
to come meet my mother...

15:10.763 --> 15:12.730
Is because I have the
wrong body parts. I know.

15:12.765 --> 15:14.015
N-no, that's not true.

15:14.049 --> 15:15.183
Really, Shahir?

15:15.217 --> 15:16.984
Your mother wouldn't
rather you were straight?

15:17.019 --> 15:19.053
Oh, of course she would,
but the point is...

15:19.071 --> 15:22.073
Shahir, I'm either a part
of your life, or I'm not.

15:22.107 --> 15:23.074
If I am, you need to...

15:23.108 --> 15:24.909
It's because you're a nurse.

15:27.079 --> 15:29.397
My mother would rather me marry,
you know, another doctor

15:29.415 --> 15:32.533
or an architect or a lawyer.

15:32.567 --> 15:35.753
You're ashamed of me because I'm a nurse?

15:36.839 --> 15:40.458
That's pathetic. You're pathetic.

15:46.965 --> 15:49.934
Hey, can you see me?

15:52.921 --> 15:56.274
Shahir. Shahir, listen,
I don't think this...

15:56.308 --> 15:59.444
this whole stimulating thing
was a good idea, okay?

16:09.872 --> 16:11.072
This is an aggressive virus.

16:11.106 --> 16:12.907
He clearly picked it up from Garcia.

16:12.941 --> 16:14.492
There could be other
people that are infected,

16:14.543 --> 16:17.328
and I think we should
shut down the hospital.

16:17.379 --> 16:18.880
Let's run some more tests on him.

16:18.914 --> 16:21.582
We can't wait for more tests.
We have to do this right now.

16:21.616 --> 16:22.917
Then we do it now.

16:22.951 --> 16:23.918
Great.

16:23.952 --> 16:25.670
Hold on. It's two cases.

16:25.721 --> 16:27.805
A lockdown could mean
massive negative press.

16:27.840 --> 16:29.307
Well, I know what it means, Bryan, but...

16:29.341 --> 16:30.508
We'll be plague hospital.

16:30.559 --> 16:31.959
You're worried about publicity?

16:31.977 --> 16:33.060
Let's be sure.

16:33.095 --> 16:34.929
And until we are, we close the doors.

16:34.963 --> 16:36.764
Listen, the Denver flight
is still in the air.

16:36.798 --> 16:38.132
They could hold it on the tarmac.

16:38.150 --> 16:40.568
The two paramedics who brought
Garcia into the hospital

16:40.602 --> 16:42.437
are still both here. I checked.

16:42.471 --> 16:43.771
Their risk is contained,

16:43.806 --> 16:46.491
and there's a chance
we can keep it that way.

16:46.525 --> 16:49.143
Let's put all surgeries on hold.

16:49.161 --> 16:52.363
Divert ambulances,
shut down the outpatient clinics,

16:52.414 --> 16:55.316
but for now, the doors stay open.

17:11.934 --> 17:16.354
My phone is dead.
I need a charger or another phone.

17:16.387 --> 17:18.940
I need to talk to my wife.
I have a wife and a daughter.

17:18.973 --> 17:21.108
Of course. I'll get you a phone.

17:21.143 --> 17:24.111
Try not to worry.
We don't know what this is yet.

17:24.146 --> 17:25.146
That's the best you got?

17:25.180 --> 17:26.614
Could just be a flu.

17:28.066 --> 17:31.185
I shouldn't have gotten involved.

17:31.203 --> 17:33.521
I should have kept my distance.

17:33.539 --> 17:35.289
I don't think that's your style.

17:50.177 --> 17:52.141
We're tracking the W.H.O. alert.

17:52.175 --> 17:55.461
Our patient flew out of Mumbai
early yesterday morning.

17:56.434 --> 17:57.630
Great office. Wow.

17:58.275 --> 17:59.348
I'm Dr. Kinney. This is Dr. Reid.

17:59.399 --> 18:01.250
- She operated on Mr. Garcia.
- Hello.

18:01.285 --> 18:02.385
Dr. Peter Hibbs,

18:02.419 --> 18:03.886
expert in the field of infectious diseases.

18:03.921 --> 18:06.138
I'm not gonna shake your hand or...

18:06.156 --> 18:08.357
touch elbows or anything else.

18:08.408 --> 18:09.692
Of course.

18:09.743 --> 18:11.244
Tell me all about your patient.

18:11.278 --> 18:13.663
Mr. Garcia presented with...

18:13.697 --> 18:16.282
Abdominal pain, high fever,
respiratory distress

18:16.316 --> 18:19.085
followed by cardiac arrest.
You saw a rapid deterioration?

18:19.119 --> 18:20.419
Absolutely, yes.

18:20.454 --> 18:21.420
Worst-case scenario?

18:21.455 --> 18:22.421
Sure.

18:22.456 --> 18:23.673
Keeping in mind

18:23.707 --> 18:26.042
that coronaviruses are
highly mutable and adaptable,

18:26.093 --> 18:27.710
and supposing that this particular one

18:27.761 --> 18:29.879
not only spreads through
airborne transmission,

18:29.930 --> 18:32.965
but that the index patient is
what we call a super-spreader,

18:32.999 --> 18:35.518
up to 20% of the hospital is dead

18:35.552 --> 18:37.720
within the next 12 to 24 hours.

18:38.805 --> 18:41.023
I'm not trying to scare you.

18:41.058 --> 18:42.308
God, no.

18:42.342 --> 18:44.627
It all depends on how
well the virus adapts.

18:44.661 --> 18:48.114
If it hijacks the immune system,
and a cytokine storm occurs?

18:48.148 --> 18:50.483
Well, then all bets are off.

18:51.535 --> 18:52.985
I'd keep that to yourself.

18:53.019 --> 18:56.072
Um, we're mentioning nothing
about a virus, as of yet.

18:56.123 --> 18:58.124
That's unwise.

18:58.158 --> 19:00.693
We're just being cautious.

19:00.711 --> 19:03.529
Dr. Reid could take you up to the I.C.U.

19:03.547 --> 19:05.798
Of course. Uh, follow me.

19:05.832 --> 19:07.166
Sure.

19:25.102 --> 19:26.686
Has anyone been in to see Charlie?

19:26.720 --> 19:27.687
No one.

19:27.721 --> 19:28.688
Not even Jackson?

19:28.722 --> 19:29.705
Not even Jackson.

19:29.740 --> 19:31.157
Okay, until we figure
out what this thing is,

19:31.191 --> 19:32.158
nobody goes through this door.

19:32.192 --> 19:33.576
Of course.

19:33.610 --> 19:35.861
I don't care if his
brain gets zapped for a week.

19:35.895 --> 19:38.781
The T.M.S. won't hurt him. A virus will.

19:44.421 --> 19:46.572
Wait a second.

19:47.574 --> 19:50.209
I know this car.

20:02.973 --> 20:05.441
Yeah, it's my parents.

20:07.027 --> 20:09.278
What is going on? What the hell
kind of virus is this, anyway?

20:09.312 --> 20:10.596
They don't know.

20:10.614 --> 20:13.366
I am living in total chaos.
This is just a gong show.

20:13.400 --> 20:14.867
I have 17 canceled surgeries,

20:14.901 --> 20:17.370
all of whom are screaming bloody murder,

20:17.404 --> 20:19.205
a cholecystectomy with abdominal pain,

20:19.239 --> 20:21.957
a septoplasty with profound
sinus inflammation,

20:21.992 --> 20:24.326
and an acute pheochromocytoma
with a migraine.

20:24.378 --> 20:27.413
Oh, and could you check on
Carol for me, too, please?

20:27.447 --> 20:29.248
Where are you going?

20:29.282 --> 20:31.500
Broken femur. Needs a traction splint.

20:31.551 --> 20:32.501
You have to help me.

20:32.552 --> 20:35.671
Uh, this is what residents do, Lin.

20:35.722 --> 20:37.673
"Lin"? What is it with you today?

20:41.261 --> 20:42.344
Here's more.

20:42.396 --> 20:43.846
Great.

20:47.434 --> 20:50.302
Carol. Your luck has officially changed.

20:50.320 --> 20:51.637
Your surgery went extremely well.

20:51.655 --> 20:54.857
Oh. That is good news.

20:54.908 --> 20:58.977
Yep, your wound looks great, um,
your vitals are stable, and, uh,

20:58.995 --> 21:00.946
how do your legs feel?

21:00.980 --> 21:01.947
Good.

21:01.981 --> 21:05.150
Can you wiggle your toes for me?

21:05.168 --> 21:06.151
Excellent.

21:06.169 --> 21:08.337
Tell you what else... an hour later,

21:08.371 --> 21:11.373
and the surgery wouldn't have happened.
How lucky is that?

21:11.425 --> 21:12.742
Why not?

21:12.776 --> 21:14.293
Hmm?

21:14.327 --> 21:17.546
Why wouldn't the surgery
have happened an hour later?

21:17.597 --> 21:20.382
There's just this virus.

21:23.220 --> 21:25.271
But, uh...

21:25.305 --> 21:30.826
you... you weren't exposed, um,
at least, not directly...

21:30.861 --> 21:33.729
So, uh, so it's unlikely that...

21:35.315 --> 21:39.585
you're gonna be just fine here,
okay? Nothing to worry about.

21:39.619 --> 21:41.153
I'll see you in a bit.

21:53.800 --> 21:56.201
We don't know yet,
but I'm not taking any chances.

21:57.637 --> 21:59.555
Well, we're tracking everyone
who came into contact

21:59.589 --> 22:02.174
with the index patient,
cancelling surgeries...

22:02.208 --> 22:06.545
Ooh. I had a kick-ass distal
pancreatectomy that got turfed.

22:08.231 --> 22:09.648
Huh?

22:10.851 --> 22:12.935
I gotta go, mom.

22:13.937 --> 22:15.404
Whoa. Stay back, stay back.

22:15.438 --> 22:16.789
Hey, you might want to keep your distance.

22:16.823 --> 22:18.274
She could be contagious. Dr. Pratt.

22:18.325 --> 22:20.276
I'm gonna get you on your side, all right?

22:21.328 --> 22:22.411
Okay.

22:22.445 --> 22:24.229
Code blue, main floor.

22:24.247 --> 22:26.115
You'll be all right.

22:28.978 --> 22:29.835
What do you want?

22:29.870 --> 22:30.836
What do you mean?

22:30.871 --> 22:32.204
Well, I paged to the O.R.,

22:32.238 --> 22:33.572
So what do you need? I'm busy.

22:33.590 --> 22:36.292
I was paged here, too.
Everything's on hold.

22:36.343 --> 22:39.077
What's going on? Did you page me?

22:39.095 --> 22:41.046
I did. I paged all three of you.

22:41.080 --> 22:42.715
Dr. Pratt is showing symptoms.

22:42.749 --> 22:44.216
High fever, respiratory distress,

22:44.250 --> 22:45.801
and a new wrinkle... seizures.

22:45.836 --> 22:47.553
We've moved her to the I.C.U.

22:47.587 --> 22:49.672
The intubation...
it was a difficult airway.

22:49.706 --> 22:50.756
Was the patient coughing?

22:50.774 --> 22:51.891
Yes.

22:51.925 --> 22:53.642
And we were the other
three people in the room.

22:53.677 --> 22:54.643
Correct.

22:54.678 --> 22:56.312
You're all under quarantine.

23:09.421 --> 23:11.839
Ladies and gentlemen, if I can...

23:13.726 --> 23:14.726
Ladies and gentlemen,

23:14.760 --> 23:16.010
if I can have your attention, please...

23:16.061 --> 23:20.265
we are going into a temporary
lockdown situation.

23:20.299 --> 23:22.317
There will be no entry or exit for now.

23:22.351 --> 23:23.685
The reason is that

23:23.736 --> 23:26.688
we have identified
a virus within the hospital.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.639
Uh, let me emphasize...
there's no reason to be alarmed.

23:28.657 --> 23:31.075
We're just being cautious.
This is standard procedure.

23:31.110 --> 23:32.777
Thank you very much.

23:34.163 --> 23:35.663
Zach.

23:35.698 --> 23:40.001
Anyone who came into contact
with Garcia goes into isolation.

23:40.035 --> 23:42.036
That means you.

23:45.924 --> 23:48.159
"Shortness of breath," check.

23:48.177 --> 23:51.029
"Sore throat"... check.

23:51.063 --> 23:54.666
"Myalgia and other nonspecific
symptoms," check and check.

23:54.700 --> 23:57.101
You have nonspecific symptoms?

23:57.136 --> 23:58.502
Normal. Do me.

23:59.484 --> 24:01.606
What if this is it?
What if we're about to die?

24:01.640 --> 24:02.724
We're not.

24:02.775 --> 24:03.958
We could.

24:03.993 --> 24:06.194
Shut up. Nobody is going to die. Okay?

24:06.228 --> 24:07.612
Just 'cause we were in the same room

24:07.646 --> 24:09.280
doesn't mean we're actually
gonna get the infection.

24:09.314 --> 24:10.181
Normal.

24:10.215 --> 24:11.516
See? Normal.

24:11.650 --> 24:14.068
No, I can't die right now.
I've got way too many regrets.

24:14.119 --> 24:16.287
You don't want to know
the last thing I said to Shahir.

24:16.322 --> 24:17.822
Yeah, you're probably right about that.

24:17.856 --> 24:19.157
You know, Victor, you need to stop.

24:19.191 --> 24:20.825
You don't even have any symptoms, okay?

24:21.860 --> 24:23.527
Uh, actually...

24:23.545 --> 24:24.829
What?

24:24.863 --> 24:26.164
"Actually," what?

24:26.198 --> 24:31.252
Uh, "99.7." you have a fever.

24:43.565 --> 24:45.266
Sir, there's no entry.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.852
Oh, I work here.
I'm Dr. Shahir Hamza. Okay?

24:47.886 --> 24:48.853
Sorry.

24:48.887 --> 24:50.905
Look, I need to get inside.

24:50.939 --> 24:52.323
I'm the chief of neurosurgery.

24:52.358 --> 24:54.659
My friend...

24:54.693 --> 24:57.395
my boyfriend is sick.

24:58.397 --> 24:59.864
I have to see him.

24:59.898 --> 25:02.500
There's no entry, sir. Step back, please.

25:08.257 --> 25:11.259
16, 120. 24, 750.

25:11.293 --> 25:13.577
Carol? You just had surgery.

25:13.595 --> 25:16.214
That's why you feel lousy.
That's all it is, okay?

25:16.248 --> 25:17.382
This is a low-risk area,

25:17.416 --> 25:19.016
and you weren't exposed to the virus.

25:19.051 --> 25:22.637
82, 87, 2606...

25:22.671 --> 25:24.055
Carol?

25:27.092 --> 25:29.277
One, one, one.

25:29.311 --> 25:31.062
Two, two, two, two, two.

25:31.096 --> 25:33.030
Three, three, three, three, three.

25:33.065 --> 25:34.816
Four, four, four, four.

25:39.905 --> 25:43.324
You know, when aunt Liz told
me you died in the accident...

25:43.375 --> 25:48.162
I didn't picture it like this.
I don't know what I imagined.

25:54.786 --> 25:57.338
You know, here's the thing.
Usually, dead people talk to me.

25:57.389 --> 26:00.842
Okay? I mean, I can't even get
'em to shut up half the time.

26:00.893 --> 26:03.261
Why aren't you talking to me?

26:06.131 --> 26:08.099
Talk to me!

26:14.940 --> 26:17.241
What is this?

26:17.276 --> 26:22.180
Why don't you stretch out,
kiddo? Try and sleep, okay?

26:25.951 --> 26:28.102
Six, eight, ten...

26:28.137 --> 26:29.954
It's called the law of contagion.

26:29.988 --> 26:31.989
It's a form of magical thinking,

26:32.007 --> 26:34.125
typical of various anxiety disorders.

26:34.159 --> 26:35.493
She associates that necklace

26:35.511 --> 26:38.162
with a positive time or
event in her life, and so,

26:38.180 --> 26:40.798
in her mind, that specialness
clings to the necklace.

26:40.832 --> 26:44.218
Sorry. Dr. Lin, Mr. Poladian
is in a foul mood.

26:44.269 --> 26:46.337
Says he's been waiting almost
an hour for you to see him.

26:46.355 --> 26:47.722
I'm on it. I'm on it.

26:48.774 --> 26:51.142
Phone's ringing. Who is it?

26:51.176 --> 26:54.845
It's the ward nurse.
Okay. Um...

26:54.863 --> 26:55.846
Maggie.

26:55.864 --> 26:56.847
I can handle this.

26:56.865 --> 26:58.182
No, you can't.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.902
You're run off your feet.
You're exhausted.

27:00.953 --> 27:02.403
Are any of your patients critical?

27:02.454 --> 27:04.455
Most of them are canceled surgeries.

27:04.490 --> 27:06.207
So that means they're just
cranky and frightened.

27:06.241 --> 27:08.543
All right? Best thing at this point?

27:08.577 --> 27:10.995
Honestly? Double dose of lorazepam.

27:11.029 --> 27:12.046
For me?

27:12.080 --> 27:14.465
For them. Let's just dose the whole ward.

27:15.717 --> 27:16.867
Your attention, please.

27:16.885 --> 27:18.436
If I could have your attention...

27:18.470 --> 27:21.305
in accordance
with public health regulations,

27:21.340 --> 27:23.941
Hope Zion is now under quarantine.

27:23.976 --> 27:28.479
I repeat, this hospital is
now under quarantine.

27:28.514 --> 27:32.216
All patients and staff
must remain where they are.

27:32.234 --> 27:35.186
All movement is fully restricted.

27:35.220 --> 27:37.522
Do not leave your room.

27:37.556 --> 27:40.224
Do not approach or touch another person.

27:40.242 --> 27:43.327
These measures are purely precautionary.

27:43.362 --> 27:46.664
We have no reason to believe
that anyone is at risk,

27:46.698 --> 27:48.916
and we are working to end the lockdown

27:48.951 --> 27:51.452
as quickly as possible.

27:51.503 --> 27:55.339
In the meantime,
thank you for your patience

27:55.374 --> 27:57.575
and your understanding.

28:16.395 --> 28:21.098
Hey. Let's get back in the room.

28:21.116 --> 28:24.118
It took that plane guy less than
24 hours to die. Don't do that.

28:24.152 --> 28:25.119
Victor.

28:25.153 --> 28:26.621
Look, you can't touch me.

28:26.655 --> 28:30.124
O-okay. Okay, fine. I know.

28:30.158 --> 28:32.827
Victor's showing symptoms.
He's diaphoretic.

28:32.878 --> 28:33.911
What's his temp?

28:33.945 --> 28:35.196
Just over 100.

28:35.230 --> 28:36.397
Look, I'm not worried about him yet.

28:36.431 --> 28:37.665
You know, he just...

28:37.716 --> 28:41.085
If he spikes over 103,
we need to get him up to I.C.U.

28:41.119 --> 28:44.121
Okay, what about you two?
Any symptoms?

28:44.156 --> 28:46.524
No, nothing yet. We're good.

28:46.558 --> 28:48.559
Good.

28:48.594 --> 28:51.062
Keep it that way, all right?

28:52.648 --> 28:56.067
I need to talk to Shahir.

28:56.101 --> 28:59.136
I need to see him. We had a big fight.

28:59.154 --> 29:02.640
You will, or I can call him for you, okay?

29:02.658 --> 29:06.027
But you're gonna be fine.
You're young and healthy.

29:06.078 --> 29:07.311
The plane guy was young.

29:07.329 --> 29:09.497
And he could have had
15 things wrong with him.

29:09.531 --> 29:11.582
Look, we don't know why he died.

29:11.617 --> 29:13.284
I'm going into the O.R.

29:13.318 --> 29:15.119
Stay here, please.

29:15.153 --> 29:16.454
Victor, this is ridiculous.

29:16.488 --> 29:18.505
Actually, you know what?
It's not such a bad idea.

29:24.096 --> 29:25.680
It's gonna be fine, right?

29:25.714 --> 29:27.298
Mm-hmm.

29:27.332 --> 29:29.600
Yeah, it is.

29:38.262 --> 29:40.013
Have you been taking your temperature?

29:40.064 --> 29:42.131
Yeah, about every two minutes.

29:42.149 --> 29:43.683
"101.3."

29:43.734 --> 29:45.301
It's going up.

29:45.319 --> 29:48.504
Yeah, it could just be a flu,
and it's not necessarily lethal.

29:48.539 --> 29:49.873
We don't know that yet.

29:49.907 --> 29:51.374
That hasn't been determined, Victor.

29:51.408 --> 29:53.409
It could kill dozens of people
in there... hundreds, even.

29:53.444 --> 29:56.829
You always know exactly what to say, huh?

29:58.916 --> 30:02.151
Charlie's defenses are down.
If he catches this, just...

30:04.154 --> 30:05.154
Don't.

30:06.257 --> 30:08.824
He's gonna be okay.

30:10.427 --> 30:12.929
What about Maggie? Where is she?

30:12.963 --> 30:14.247
I don't know.

30:14.281 --> 30:15.548
You don't know?

30:15.599 --> 30:19.102
I've... kind of been a little occupied.

30:19.136 --> 30:20.770
No...

30:20.804 --> 30:22.838
Sorry, that sounded really cruel.

30:22.856 --> 30:26.059
No, I have not, uh, called Maggie.

30:29.029 --> 30:32.899
What? What are you looking
at me like that for?

30:32.950 --> 30:34.617
You've been cheating on her.

30:34.652 --> 30:36.569
Why would you assume that?

30:36.620 --> 30:37.870
Because I know you, Joel.

30:37.905 --> 30:39.072
That's why you haven't called her.

30:39.123 --> 30:40.940
You feel guilty, so you're avoiding her.

30:40.975 --> 30:43.576
Okay, wow, this is, like, blindsiding...

30:43.627 --> 30:45.628
You know what? You don't need
to try to make it better for me.

30:45.646 --> 30:46.796
You are unbelievable.

30:46.830 --> 30:48.114
You did this all through med school,

30:48.148 --> 30:49.699
even before we dated.

30:49.717 --> 30:51.251
It's your pattern.

30:51.302 --> 30:54.137
You take something really beautiful,
and you screw it up.

30:54.171 --> 30:56.038
Okay. It's none of your business.

30:56.056 --> 30:57.540
You're right. It is none of my business.

30:57.558 --> 30:59.842
It's Maggie's business,
and I feel sorry for her.

31:03.964 --> 31:07.684
Truth is, I don't really
even feel that bad.

31:11.872 --> 31:14.223
What if I'm wrong?

31:15.225 --> 31:17.443
What if it isn't post-op?

31:17.494 --> 31:19.112
She could have the virus.

31:20.748 --> 31:22.148
She doesn't.

31:22.182 --> 31:25.168
You don't know that, though.
We could all have it.

31:27.671 --> 31:31.040
Mm, hey. Can I tell you something?

31:31.074 --> 31:32.458
Mm-hmm.

31:32.509 --> 31:35.745
You remember that time that I kissed you?

31:35.763 --> 31:36.946
Yeah.

31:40.601 --> 31:43.052
I shouldn't have done that.

31:43.086 --> 31:46.522
I take it back. Okay?

31:46.557 --> 31:50.643
I'm sorry for the way
I've been treating you.

31:50.694 --> 31:53.363
I've been sort of dick-ish.

31:54.648 --> 31:56.098
No, you haven't.

31:56.116 --> 31:58.934
No, I have. I have. I know I have.

31:58.952 --> 32:01.654
My behavior has just been...

32:01.705 --> 32:03.573
bad.

32:06.994 --> 32:08.378
Hey.

32:08.412 --> 32:11.080
It's 2:00 A.M. Get some sleep.

32:12.716 --> 32:15.051
We could share it.

32:18.972 --> 32:20.256
All right.

32:47.818 --> 32:51.153
I never imagined my last supper
would be wrapped in plastic.

32:51.171 --> 32:53.823
At this point, I'm just
happy I can still chew.

32:55.843 --> 32:57.043
Got a code.

32:57.094 --> 32:58.961
Grab the cart.
I'll start compressions.

33:00.214 --> 33:02.665
Code blue, I.C.U.
Code blue, I.C.U.

33:02.683 --> 33:04.934
He's unconscious in P.E.A. arrest.

33:04.968 --> 33:07.603
The antibiotics and
antivirals aren't working.

33:07.638 --> 33:10.840
His O2 sats are under 80.
End tidal CO2 is rising.

33:10.858 --> 33:13.609
We need to clear the airway.
Push epi and atropine.

33:17.030 --> 33:18.013
Paddles.

33:19.032 --> 33:20.015
What?

33:20.033 --> 33:21.451
That was way too fast. 200.

33:21.485 --> 33:22.452
Clear.

33:25.539 --> 33:27.022
We're going to 300.

33:27.040 --> 33:28.023
You got it.

33:29.209 --> 33:30.693
Clear.

33:48.345 --> 33:50.263
It's not like Maggie and I are married

33:50.314 --> 33:52.064
Or anything, or even in a...
in a serious relationship.

33:52.099 --> 33:54.550
Are you kidding me? Excuses.
Are you listening to yourself?

33:54.568 --> 33:56.352
You can't commit to anything or anyone.

33:56.386 --> 33:57.353
Including you.

33:57.387 --> 33:58.688
Yes, including me.

33:58.722 --> 34:00.523
We were living together,
and that still wasn't enough

34:00.557 --> 34:02.108
for you to make an actual commitment.

34:02.159 --> 34:04.160
Hey, hey, hey, hey. You were
the one that walked out on me.

34:04.194 --> 34:05.778
Because you cheated on me.

34:05.829 --> 34:08.697
You wanted out, and you didn't
have the guts, so I walked.

34:08.732 --> 34:10.283
Great, so you dodged a bullet.

34:10.333 --> 34:13.585
No, I didn't, Joel. You broke my heart.

34:18.257 --> 34:21.344
Anytime that something gets
serious with you, you run away.

34:21.378 --> 34:24.714
You live your life in fear.
You think that you're this...

34:24.748 --> 34:28.684
this big, fearless cowboy,
but the truth is...

34:28.719 --> 34:34.023
the truth is that you will
never take a risk... ever.

34:38.277 --> 34:40.262
Hey!

34:59.383 --> 35:00.449
Melanda.

35:00.467 --> 35:02.835
Dr. Wilson just died.

35:02.886 --> 35:05.922
Respiratory failure.
And Dr. Pratt is critical.

35:05.956 --> 35:07.122
What about Charlie?

35:07.140 --> 35:09.425
Charlie's fine. No fever.

35:09.459 --> 35:10.843
Is he still being zapped?

35:10.894 --> 35:12.762
Yeah, and I'm not going
near him to turn it off.

35:12.796 --> 35:14.397
Are you and Joel okay?

35:15.449 --> 35:16.432
We're fine.

35:16.466 --> 35:17.767
What about Victor?

35:19.903 --> 35:21.136
Alex.

35:21.154 --> 35:22.939
He's coughing. You need
to send a team down now.

35:22.973 --> 35:24.473
I will. Don't go near him.

35:24.491 --> 35:25.474
Where are you going?

35:25.492 --> 35:26.859
It's Victor.

35:28.612 --> 35:30.980
- All right. Get you on your side.
- Al.

35:30.998 --> 35:32.314
Get him some oxygen.

35:32.332 --> 35:33.482
I'm on my way.

35:33.500 --> 35:35.251
Victor, you're gonna... you're okay.

35:35.285 --> 35:37.086
Attaboy. Give me a sec. Hold his head.

35:37.120 --> 35:38.087
Okay. Just breathe.

35:38.121 --> 35:39.589
That's it, buddy. Take it easy.

35:39.623 --> 35:40.590
Just breathe.

35:40.624 --> 35:41.591
Just breathe.

35:41.625 --> 35:42.708
Just breathe.

35:42.759 --> 35:44.126
We're gonna be okay.

35:44.160 --> 35:47.346
That's it, bud.

35:48.432 --> 35:50.967
This can't be a memory.

35:51.001 --> 35:53.502
I wasn't here.

35:53.520 --> 35:56.889
There's no room. John, there's no room.

35:56.940 --> 35:57.890
Hold on.

35:57.941 --> 35:58.975
Slow down.

35:59.009 --> 36:00.943
You're not gonna make it! John!

36:04.982 --> 36:06.065
It's Pratt.

36:06.116 --> 36:07.650
Move it. Let's go.

36:09.686 --> 36:11.687
She's coding.

36:40.100 --> 36:42.869
I have run two levels of molecular tests

36:42.903 --> 36:44.921
and consulted at some
length with the W.H.O.,

36:44.955 --> 36:47.240
- re: the Mumbai cluster.
- And...

36:47.274 --> 36:50.076
The incubation period has
been confirmed at 12 hours.

36:50.110 --> 36:51.294
Which means that...

36:51.328 --> 36:53.079
I've prepared a short
report with a timeline...

36:53.113 --> 36:54.831
Just the bullet points, please.

36:57.835 --> 36:59.252
The virus is not airborne.

36:59.286 --> 37:01.171
It's transmitted through
large droplets only...

37:01.222 --> 37:02.555
no secondary transmission.

37:02.590 --> 37:04.007
Garcia, the index patient,

37:04.058 --> 37:07.093
infected Dr. Wilson,
Dr. Pratt, and Victor Reis,

37:07.127 --> 37:09.395
and while a number of others were exposed,

37:09.430 --> 37:12.432
due to the unpredictable
and capricious nature

37:12.466 --> 37:15.268
of any virus, they escaped infection.

37:15.302 --> 37:16.803
So we're in the clear?

37:16.837 --> 37:19.072
Yes. Dr. Kinney, you can open the doors.

37:19.106 --> 37:21.741
For a minute there,
you sounded disappointed.

37:21.775 --> 37:22.942
No, of course not. I'm thrilled.

37:22.976 --> 37:26.696
Although, I did think this
might have been the one.

37:26.747 --> 37:30.333
It had so much potential.

37:31.418 --> 37:33.670
God. Look at that.

37:54.525 --> 37:55.675
Okay.

37:55.693 --> 37:57.360
Remember, in the extremely
unlikely event that

37:57.394 --> 38:00.063
you develop any symptoms,
either a shortness of breath or fever,

38:00.114 --> 38:02.949
you must return to the hospital
immediately for treatment.

38:02.983 --> 38:05.068
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

38:06.070 --> 38:07.537
You'll be fine.

38:10.691 --> 38:12.742
You're doing great, Carol.
Everything's on track.

38:12.793 --> 38:14.026
Thanks to you.

38:14.044 --> 38:16.412
No, it's all part of
your post-op recovery.

38:16.463 --> 38:19.865
I have a request.
It might seem a little weird.

38:19.884 --> 38:22.368
I wonder if I might have
something of yours...

38:22.403 --> 38:24.504
something personal.

38:24.538 --> 38:27.257
Hey. A lock of your hair, maybe.

38:27.308 --> 38:29.976
I know that must sound strange.

38:30.010 --> 38:32.762
Tell you what... I'm gonna
give you something better.

38:32.813 --> 38:35.181
This is Dr. Murphy.

38:35.215 --> 38:39.652
Keep him close, and you'll
feel better, guaranteed.

38:40.654 --> 38:42.739
Hi, Carol. Dr. Murphy.

38:42.773 --> 38:44.157
I don't think we actually officially met.

38:44.191 --> 38:45.558
No.

38:45.576 --> 38:49.495
I was hoping, uh, to talk to you
a little bit about your numbers.

38:49.530 --> 38:50.580
Dr. Lin had mentioned

38:50.614 --> 38:52.865
that you have a ritual with your counting.

38:52.899 --> 38:55.919
Yes, I do. The special numbers...

38:55.953 --> 38:58.187
I have to say them in the right order.

38:58.222 --> 39:00.673
Um, is there any specific significance

39:00.708 --> 39:02.074
that you have to these numbers?

39:02.092 --> 39:05.745
Are they somebody's birthday
or an address or something?

39:12.770 --> 39:15.772
Okay, fever's coming down.

39:15.806 --> 39:18.057
You can thank your immune system.

39:19.109 --> 39:21.894
What I said before...

39:21.928 --> 39:23.146
I know.

39:23.197 --> 39:25.648
I didn't mean it.

39:30.437 --> 39:32.622
I love you, Victor.

39:35.960 --> 39:37.660
Well...

39:37.711 --> 39:40.213
it's about time.

40:04.388 --> 40:06.138
I'm gonna go first. Can I go first?

40:06.156 --> 40:09.242
Um, yeah, of c... you can.

40:09.276 --> 40:11.411
This is gonna sound mean,
and I don't mean it to.

40:11.445 --> 40:12.645
Okay. I'm just gonna say it.

40:12.663 --> 40:15.448
You're a terrible boyfriend.

40:15.482 --> 40:17.033
It's true.

40:17.084 --> 40:18.284
Yeah.

40:18.318 --> 40:22.171
I mean, really, really terrible...
incredibly bad...

40:23.207 --> 40:25.758
And I can do so much better than you.

40:29.713 --> 40:33.032
You're absolutely right.

40:36.020 --> 40:38.438
I'm sorry, Maggie.

40:39.640 --> 40:42.225
I'm sorry, too.

40:45.946 --> 40:49.198
God, this is so sad.

40:55.355 --> 40:57.073
Okay.

41:10.036 --> 41:11.003
Thank you.

41:15.092 --> 41:16.876
Charlie?

41:16.894 --> 41:18.428
Melanda!

41:21.565 --> 41:22.765
Holy crap.

41:22.816 --> 41:23.766
Who moved him?

41:23.817 --> 41:24.767
No one. The room was sealed.

41:24.818 --> 41:26.853
No one's been in here.

41:30.657 --> 41:34.660
Nothing on the E.E.G. It wasn't a seizure.

41:34.695 --> 41:35.995
I'm paging Shahir.

41:36.029 --> 41:38.081
You moved.

41:39.750 --> 41:41.868
Charlie.

41:42.920 --> 41:45.070
You moved.

41:54.264 --> 41:57.133
It's like this guy's driving a tractor.

41:57.184 --> 41:59.719
There's no room. John, there's no room.

41:59.753 --> 42:00.720
Daddy, slow down.

42:00.754 --> 42:02.271
- Hold on.
- Slow down!

42:02.306 --> 42:03.723
Daddy, please slow down!

42:03.757 --> 42:06.025
You're not gonna make it! John!

42:07.261 --> 42:10.012
I was in the car.

42:17.221 --> 42:21.157
And I saw my parents...

42:21.191 --> 42:23.108
die.

42:26.947 --> 42:28.798
Whatever this is...

42:32.035 --> 42:33.002
it's working.
