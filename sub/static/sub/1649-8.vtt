00:07.884 --> 00:09.875
(Carol sobbing )

00:24.609 --> 00:27.146
Daryl:
Don't look. Don't look.

00:38.706 --> 00:41.072
( Beth sobbing )

00:56.015 --> 00:58.631
Shh, shh.
Wait, wait.

01:11.197 --> 01:13.859
Ma.

01:14.033 --> 01:16.945
- ( growling)
- ( screaming )

01:18.955 --> 01:21.287
Come on!

01:22.291 --> 01:23.952
Pull her away!
Pull her away!

01:28.589 --> 01:30.796
(grunting)

01:47.566 --> 01:50.649
(sobbing )

02:04.166 --> 02:06.327
We've been out. We've been combing
these woods looking for her

02:06.502 --> 02:08.493
and she was
in there all along?

02:08.671 --> 02:11.083
- You knew.
- Maggie: Leave us alone.

02:11.257 --> 02:12.918
- Hey, Shane, just stop, man.
- Get your hands off me.

02:13.092 --> 02:15.754
You knew
and you kept it from us.

02:15.928 --> 02:17.714
- Hershel: I didn't know.
- That's bullshit.

02:17.888 --> 02:19.549
- I think y'all knew.
- We didn't know!

02:19.724 --> 02:22.682
- Why was she there?!
- Your--

02:22.852 --> 02:25.639
Otis put those people
in the barn.

02:27.023 --> 02:29.981
Maybe he found her and put her
in there before he was killed.

02:30.151 --> 02:31.357
You expect me
to believe that?

02:31.527 --> 02:33.063
- I look like an idiot?
- Shane, hey, hey, hey.

02:33.237 --> 02:36.024
- I don't care what you believe!
- Everybody just calm down.

02:36.198 --> 02:37.813
- Get him off my land!
- Please. No.

02:37.992 --> 02:40.859
- Let me tell you something.
- Hey. Don't touch him!

02:41.871 --> 02:44.362
Haven't you done enough?

02:49.920 --> 02:53.412
I mean it-- off my land.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.550
- ( door closes)
- What are you doing?

03:06.729 --> 03:08.720
Hey, what are you doing?

03:08.898 --> 03:11.264
Daryl almost died
looking for her, Rick.

03:11.442 --> 03:13.433
Any one of us could have.
I'm gonna tell you right now--

03:13.611 --> 03:16.068
that son of a bitch,
he knew.

03:16.238 --> 03:17.899
He didn't know.
He's not like that.

03:18.074 --> 03:19.939
- He opened his home to us.
- Put us all in danger.

03:20.117 --> 03:21.903
He kept a barn full of walkers.

03:22.078 --> 03:23.238
So you just start
an insurrection,

03:23.412 --> 03:24.993
hand out guns
and massacre his family?

03:25.164 --> 03:27.075
- His family's dead, Rick.
- Well, he doesn't believe that.

03:27.249 --> 03:28.284
He thinks you just
murdered them in cold blood.

03:28.459 --> 03:29.665
No, man, I don't care
what he thinks.

03:29.835 --> 03:32.247
l was handling it, brother.
I was handling it and you just--

03:32.421 --> 03:35.003
You had us out in those woods
looking for a little girl

03:35.174 --> 03:36.914
that every single one
of us knew was dead!

03:37.093 --> 03:38.378
That's what you did.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.634
Rick, you're just
as delusional as that guy.

03:40.805 --> 03:43.421
(snons)
You were handling it, huh?

03:50.773 --> 03:53.355
(theme music playing )

04:27.351 --> 04:29.342
( clanking )

04:56.797 --> 04:58.879
- ( footsteps approach )
- ( door opens )

05:28.996 --> 05:30.702
l have to ask you--

05:32.166 --> 05:34.157
did you know
she was in the barn?

05:48.891 --> 05:51.428
You know, maybe in some
weird way this is for the best.

05:52.728 --> 05:54.764
At least we know
and now we can move on.

05:56.190 --> 05:59.227
- Move on?
- Yeah, it's just like...

06:00.528 --> 06:03.770
it meant so much to everyone--
finding her, you know?

06:03.948 --> 06:07.281
- And then--
- So now you'll just move on?

06:07.451 --> 06:09.066
If we can.

06:09.245 --> 06:12.954
I mean, we've lost others.

06:14.625 --> 06:18.083
( laughs )
This is-- this is Sophia.

06:21.382 --> 06:23.247
The whole group--

06:23.425 --> 06:25.882
this one was different.

06:28.764 --> 06:31.255
So what happens now?

06:31.433 --> 06:33.094
We bury her...

06:34.478 --> 06:38.096
with your stepmom
and your stepbrother.

06:40.276 --> 06:42.267
And then?

06:50.619 --> 06:52.280
I don't know.

06:53.831 --> 06:56.823
- Carl: I thought I'd find her.
- Lori: We all did.

06:57.001 --> 06:59.117
Carl:
I mean me.

06:59.295 --> 07:01.581
That I'd be the one.

07:02.673 --> 07:04.664
Like maybe she was
hiding somewhere

07:04.842 --> 07:06.173
in a cave or a tree.

07:06.343 --> 07:08.129
She'd be safe

07:08.304 --> 07:11.512
and I'd find her
and bring her back.

07:15.644 --> 07:17.851
He did the right thing...

07:20.107 --> 07:21.688
shooting her like that.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.312
I would've done it, too.

07:29.450 --> 07:30.940
Dale?

07:32.328 --> 07:33.818
Yeah?

07:33.996 --> 07:35.156
Could you take Carl
up to the house?

07:35.331 --> 07:37.697
I want you to rest.

07:37.875 --> 07:39.490
Okay.

07:46.634 --> 07:48.795
Hey, you dropped that.

07:58.812 --> 08:01.189
You want us
to start burying?

08:01.357 --> 08:04.724
We need a service.
Carol would want that.

08:04.902 --> 08:06.688
Yeah, we all want that.

08:12.242 --> 08:14.904
Let's-- let's dig
a grave for Sophia,

08:15.079 --> 08:17.741
and Annette and Shawn...

08:19.583 --> 08:21.084
over by those trees.

08:22.878 --> 08:24.209
And we'll need a truck
to move the bodies.

08:24.380 --> 08:26.666
- I'll get the keys.
- No, no.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.705
I got the truck.

08:28.884 --> 08:31.717
Jimmy: And the others?
That's a lot of digging.

08:31.887 --> 08:34.879
We bury the ones we love
and and burn the rest.

08:37.101 --> 08:38.682
Let's get to work.

08:44.733 --> 08:46.769
(whispering )
What did Hershel say?

08:48.445 --> 08:51.278
He wants us off the farm.

08:52.616 --> 08:54.277
Or Shane at least.

08:56.370 --> 08:58.281
That's not a surprise.

08:58.455 --> 09:00.787
We're lucky
someone wasn't killed.

09:00.958 --> 09:02.414
And all that gunfire--

09:02.584 --> 09:04.575
more walkers
could've heard it.

09:07.548 --> 09:10.915
Baby, what is it?

09:13.637 --> 09:15.969
She was there all the time.

09:16.140 --> 09:18.426
And you did
everything you could.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.636
Yeah, I know.
I always do, don't I?

09:21.979 --> 09:24.095
Went after her,
protected her,

09:24.273 --> 09:26.764
killed those walkers,
but she still got bit.

09:26.942 --> 09:28.773
And Car! still got shot.

09:28.944 --> 09:32.107
People counting on me
and I had 'em chasing

09:32.281 --> 09:34.488
- a ghost in a forest.
- Hey.

09:56.805 --> 09:58.796
( scoffs )

09:59.850 --> 10:02.683
(mmmm)

10:13.489 --> 10:15.480
Do you got something
to say, Dale?

10:17.034 --> 10:19.446
Well, go ahead, man.

10:19.620 --> 10:22.327
Mr. Moral Authority, huh?
(chuckles)

10:22.498 --> 10:26.207
You the--
the voice of reason.

10:28.670 --> 10:30.331
Let me ask you something, man.
What do you do?

10:30.506 --> 10:32.167
What do you do to keep
this camp safe, huh?

10:32.341 --> 10:34.206
What do you do?
What, you fix up an RV?

10:34.384 --> 10:36.340
You babysit some guns?

10:36.512 --> 10:38.503
Man, you pointed one
at my chest, right?

10:38.680 --> 10:41.968
But you just-- you couldn't pull
that trigger, could you?

10:44.019 --> 10:45.850
If I was such a danger,
if I was such a threat,

10:46.021 --> 10:47.352
what did you do
to stop me, huh?

10:48.816 --> 10:50.898
l smashed that barn open.
I saved Carl.

10:51.068 --> 10:53.650
That's me. That ain't you.
That ain't Rick. That's me.

10:55.364 --> 10:56.900
Tell you what, Dale--

10:57.074 --> 11:00.566
next time I need
a radiator hose...

11:00.744 --> 11:03.201
(scoffs)
I'll give you a call, man.

11:03.372 --> 11:05.363
(engine starts)

11:35.112 --> 11:36.602
That's it.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.281
( knocks )

11:50.961 --> 11:52.917
They're ready.

11:56.258 --> 11:57.748
Come on.

11:59.386 --> 12:00.922
Why?

12:01.096 --> 12:03.929
Daryl:
'Cause that's your little girl.

12:06.768 --> 12:09.635
That's not my little girl.

12:09.813 --> 12:13.305
That's some other thing.

12:18.572 --> 12:20.938
My Sophia was alone
in the woods.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.279
All this time, I thought--

12:29.458 --> 12:31.665
She didn't cry
herself to sleep.

12:31.835 --> 12:34.451
She didn't go hungry.

12:36.506 --> 12:38.633
She didn't try
to find her way back.

12:41.845 --> 12:44.131
Sophia died
a long time ago.

13:48.245 --> 13:50.236
(wind blowing)

14:14.646 --> 14:16.637
(birds chirping)

14:45.969 --> 14:47.755
(Andrea grunts)

14:52.601 --> 14:55.468
- Rick: A few more trips.
- Andrea: We got lucky.

14:55.645 --> 14:57.601
If that barn had any more,
we could've been overrun.

14:57.773 --> 14:59.229
( T-Dog grunts )

14:59.399 --> 15:01.776
Good thing Shane did
what he did when he did.

15:01.943 --> 15:03.979
You can't tell me
this was right.

15:04.154 --> 15:06.611
It wasn't.
lt'll cost us with Hershel.

15:06.782 --> 15:08.397
He's grieving.
He'll come around,

15:10.952 --> 15:12.783
Look, I shot, too.
This wasn't all Shane.

15:12.954 --> 15:14.455
T-Dog:
Look, I got no qualms about it.

15:14.623 --> 15:17.615
Walkers in my backyard?
Mm-mmm.

15:17.793 --> 15:18.782
Dale: I'm not saying
that we shouldn't have

15:18.960 --> 15:22.088
taken care of the problem,
but creating a panic to--

15:22.255 --> 15:24.086
There's no point arguing
about it. It's done.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.464
There's nothing
we can do about it.

15:28.303 --> 15:30.134
T-Dog:
Better get moving.

15:39.773 --> 15:42.731
- ( kicks)
- ( engine starts)

15:55.122 --> 15:56.953
Hey! Hey!

16:02.129 --> 16:04.245
( groans )

16:10.345 --> 16:12.006
All right!

16:15.809 --> 16:17.800
( footsteps approach )

16:21.690 --> 16:24.102
So if your group leaves,
you wouldn't stay?

16:24.276 --> 16:26.767
|-- I hadn't really
thought about it.

16:26.945 --> 16:30.529
I mean, |--
I didn't know that--

16:31.950 --> 16:34.157
do-- do you think
this is really the time

16:34.327 --> 16:35.578
to discuss this, I mean?

16:35.745 --> 16:39.203
Well, I'm not really feeling like
there's a lot of time for anything.

16:39.374 --> 16:41.365
No, no, there-- there is.

16:44.212 --> 16:47.704
There is.
I'd want--

16:47.883 --> 16:50.716
- ( clatters )
- Maggie: Oh, my God.

16:50.886 --> 16:53.172
Sweetie, can you hear me?

16:54.973 --> 16:57.885
- What's wrong with her?
- She might be in shock.

16:58.059 --> 17:00.675
- Where's Hershel?
- We can't find him anywhere.

17:03.899 --> 17:05.890
Hey, kiddo.

17:08.403 --> 17:11.520
- Your stepmother's things?
- He was so sure she'd recover.

17:11.698 --> 17:14.531
They'd just pick up
where they left off.

17:17.871 --> 17:20.032
Looks like he found
an old friend.

17:23.251 --> 17:25.913
That belonged to my grandfather,
gave it to Dad when he died.

17:26.087 --> 17:28.749
I didn't take Hershel
for a drinker.

17:28.924 --> 17:31.085
No, he gave it up
on the day l was born.

17:31.259 --> 17:33.250
He didn't even
allow liquor in the house.

17:35.055 --> 17:37.922
- What's the bar in town?
- Maggie: Hatlin's.

17:38.099 --> 17:39.930
He practically lived there
in his drinking days.

17:40.101 --> 17:41.682
Betting that's where
I'll find him.

17:41.853 --> 17:43.434
Yeah, I've seen the place.
I'll take you.

17:43.605 --> 17:44.936
- All right, I'll get the truck.
- Okay.

17:45.106 --> 17:47.722
- No.
- It's an easy run.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.437
- Like the pharmacy?
- Hey, Maggie?

17:49.611 --> 17:51.727
( chuckles)
I'll bring him back.

17:51.905 --> 17:54.066
Glenn:
Maggie, that was different.

17:54.241 --> 17:55.777
Rick?

17:55.951 --> 17:58.567
You want to have a conversation
about this before you leave?

17:58.745 --> 18:00.451
So you're seriously
gonna go after this guy

18:00.622 --> 18:01.782
with everything
that's going on, huh?

18:01.957 --> 18:03.618
He's right.
He's right.

18:03.792 --> 18:05.532
This is not the time
to head off, not today.

18:05.710 --> 18:07.871
- You don't always have to--
- I'm not arguing.

18:08.046 --> 18:09.536
It's the least I can do
for Hershel after we--

18:09.714 --> 18:12.091
What?
After we what?

18:15.095 --> 18:17.302
Carl said he would've
shot Sophia himself.

18:17.472 --> 18:19.758
That's your son.
He's getting cold.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.639
He's growing up
in a world with--

18:23.770 --> 18:26.432
he's growing up in a world where
he needs a father like you--

18:26.606 --> 18:28.312
around, alive,

18:28.483 --> 18:30.314
not running off, solving everybody
else's problems.

18:30.485 --> 18:32.476
lt's notjust his problem
I'm trying to solve.

18:32.654 --> 18:35.987
We need Hershel
for the baby.

18:38.952 --> 18:40.817
I'm going after him.

19:12.694 --> 19:15.026
- You ready?
- Yeah.

19:28.209 --> 19:30.200
(engine starts)

19:43.683 --> 19:46.390
( rustling )

20:08.541 --> 20:10.042
Hey.

20:11.044 --> 20:12.534
Carol?

20:13.755 --> 20:15.165
Carol.

20:15.340 --> 20:17.331
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

20:18.426 --> 20:21.088
Hey, are you all right?

20:24.182 --> 20:26.173
(water splashes )

20:33.608 --> 20:36.441
I want you to know
that I'm real sorry for your girl.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.773
Thank you.

20:45.203 --> 20:47.535
When I opened that barn
I had no idea.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.833
If I did...

20:53.962 --> 20:55.953
Everybody thinks
that I'm a...

21:00.051 --> 21:02.588
l was just trying
to keep everybody safe.

21:09.436 --> 21:11.643
I had no idea
she was in there.

21:21.823 --> 21:23.484
This place is going to hell.

21:23.658 --> 21:24.818
Yeah, I'm trying hard
to prevent that.

21:24.993 --> 21:26.654
You won't be able to.

21:26.828 --> 21:28.944
No, there are people
in this group

21:29.122 --> 21:31.738
who think that what
Shane did was justified.

21:31.916 --> 21:33.326
I know you two
can't stand each other,

21:33.501 --> 21:35.332
but he did something
that needed to be done.

21:35.503 --> 21:37.164
He's dangerous.

21:37.338 --> 21:38.953
Yeah, he's a hothead.

21:39.132 --> 21:40.997
No,Loﬁ,
he's dangerous.

21:42.177 --> 21:44.509
I think he killed Otis.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.253
Otis was killed
by walkers.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.673
He knew how
to handle walkers.

21:50.852 --> 21:53.013
Otis was the one who was
putting them in the barn.

21:53.188 --> 21:55.179
You need to be really clear
with me right now.

21:55.356 --> 21:58.098
- What are you saying?
- I believe that--

21:58.276 --> 22:01.518
that Shane sacrificed Otis.

22:02.864 --> 22:04.149
I can't prove it,
but |-|-|--

22:04.324 --> 22:05.860
I think that he--
I think that he shot him

22:06.034 --> 22:08.946
and left him for bait,
so that he could get away.

22:10.663 --> 22:13.200
Shane may be a hothead,
but he's not a murderer.

22:13.374 --> 22:15.501
And why would he kill somebody
who's trying to help?

22:15.668 --> 22:17.374
I don't know.
Maybe he was pinned down.

22:17.545 --> 22:20.878
He said-- he said it.
He all but threw it in my face.

22:22.383 --> 22:25.341
I'm telling you--
I knew guys like him,

22:25.512 --> 22:27.844
and sooner or later...

22:29.724 --> 22:31.715
he's gonna kill
somebody else.

22:40.860 --> 22:40.894
(bird cawing)

22:40.902 --> 22:42.767
(bird cawing)

22:59.337 --> 23:01.578
Maggie said she loves me.

23:02.590 --> 23:03.966
Mm-hmm.

23:05.176 --> 23:06.586
She doesn't mean it.

23:06.761 --> 23:10.003
I mean, she can't.
I mean, why...

23:10.181 --> 23:14.766
She's upset or confused.
She's probably feeling, like--

23:14.936 --> 23:17.678
I think she's smart enough
to know what she's feeling.

23:17.855 --> 23:20.346
- No. No.
-( laughs)

23:20.525 --> 23:23.608
You know, she wants
to be in love,

23:23.778 --> 23:27.817
so she needs something
to, like, hold onto.

23:27.991 --> 23:30.152
Glenn, it's pretty obvious
to everyone Maggie loves you,

23:30.326 --> 23:32.442
and notjust because you're one
of the last men standing.

23:34.247 --> 23:36.784
I didn't say it back.

23:36.958 --> 23:39.165
Huh.

23:39.335 --> 23:41.621
I've never had a woman
say that to me before

23:41.796 --> 23:44.378
except my mom, of course,

23:44.549 --> 23:46.540
and my sisters.

23:46.718 --> 23:48.800
But with Maggie,
it's different.

23:48.970 --> 23:50.756
I mean, we barely
know each other.

23:50.930 --> 23:53.888
What does she really
know about me? Nothing.

23:54.058 --> 23:56.265
We're practically strangers.

23:56.436 --> 23:58.142
But I didn't know
what to do with it.

23:58.313 --> 24:00.269
ljust stood there like a jerk.

24:00.440 --> 24:02.647
Hey. Hey, this is
a good thing.

24:02.817 --> 24:05.103
Something we don't get
enough of these days.

24:05.278 --> 24:06.643
Enjoy it.

24:06.821 --> 24:08.982
And when we get back,
return the favor.

24:09.157 --> 24:10.693
It's not like
she's going anywhere.

24:23.421 --> 24:25.286
- ( engine stops)
- Rick?

24:25.465 --> 24:27.001
I know about Lori,

24:27.175 --> 24:29.336
her being pregnant.

24:29.510 --> 24:32.172
- I got her those pills.
- I figured.

24:38.853 --> 24:40.639
Hey, I'm sorry
I kept it from you.

24:40.813 --> 24:44.431
Don't be. You did what
you thought was right.

24:45.943 --> 24:48.810
It just so happens it wasn't.

25:11.636 --> 25:13.501
Her heart's racing.
She's burning up.

25:13.680 --> 25:16.046
We need Hershel.
He'll know what to do.

25:19.727 --> 25:23.720
- Would you look in on Car! for me?
- Of course.

25:28.361 --> 25:30.647
( knife scraping )

25:30.822 --> 25:32.687
Moving to the suburbs?

25:35.076 --> 25:37.533
Listen, Beth's in some kind
of catatonic shock.

25:37.704 --> 25:40.696
- We need Hershel.
- Yeah. So what?

25:40.873 --> 25:42.909
So I need you to run
into town real quick

25:43.084 --> 25:45.075
and bring him
and Rick back.

25:46.587 --> 25:48.088
Daryl?

25:50.383 --> 25:52.214
Your bitch went
window-shopping.

25:52.385 --> 25:54.671
You want him?
Fetch him yourself.

25:54.846 --> 25:56.711
I got better things to do.

25:56.889 --> 25:58.390
What's the matter with you?

25:58.558 --> 26:00.344
Why would you be so selfish?

26:00.518 --> 26:02.759
Selfish?
Listen to me, Olive Oyl.

26:02.937 --> 26:05.724
l was out there looking
for that little girl every single day.

26:05.898 --> 26:08.014
I took a bullet
and an arrow in the process.

26:08.192 --> 26:10.604
Don't you tell me about
me getting my hands dirty!

26:11.946 --> 26:14.107
You want those two idiots?
Have a nice ride.

26:15.408 --> 26:17.194
I'm done looking for people.

26:36.471 --> 26:38.382
Hershel.

26:39.766 --> 26:41.882
Who's with you?

26:42.059 --> 26:43.595
Glenn.

26:46.105 --> 26:47.970
Maggie send him?

26:48.149 --> 26:50.105
He volunteered.

26:50.276 --> 26:52.232
He's good like that.

27:03.664 --> 27:07.122
- How many have you had?
- Not enough.

27:10.171 --> 27:12.628
Let's finish this up
back at home.

27:12.799 --> 27:15.006
Beth collapsed,

27:15.176 --> 27:18.134
is in some sort of state.

27:18.304 --> 27:21.467
Must be in shock.
I think you are, too.

27:22.767 --> 27:24.177
Maggie's with her?

27:24.352 --> 27:27.185
Yeah, but Beth needs you.

27:27.355 --> 27:29.311
What could I do?

27:29.482 --> 27:31.643
She needs her mother.

27:31.818 --> 27:33.854
Or rather to mourn...

27:35.029 --> 27:37.361
like she should've
done weeks ago.

27:37.532 --> 27:40.319
l robbed her of that.

27:41.702 --> 27:43.363
| see that now.

27:45.665 --> 27:47.826
You thought
there was a cure.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.208
Can't blame yourself
for holding out for hope.

27:52.505 --> 27:54.166
Hope?

27:57.134 --> 28:00.046
When I first saw you
running across my field

28:00.221 --> 28:02.177
with your boy
in your arms,

28:03.808 --> 28:06.299
I had little hope
he would survive.

28:06.477 --> 28:08.183
But he did.

28:10.773 --> 28:12.729
Eventhough
we lost Otis.

28:12.900 --> 28:16.188
Your man Shane
made it back

28:16.362 --> 28:18.398
and we saved your boy.

28:20.324 --> 28:23.908
That was the miracle
that proved to me miracles do exist.

28:26.497 --> 28:28.533
Only it was a sham,

28:28.708 --> 28:30.323
a bait and switch.

28:33.880 --> 28:36.041
l was a fool, Rick.

28:37.592 --> 28:39.753
And you people saw that.

28:44.891 --> 28:47.724
My daughters deserve
better than that.

29:34.440 --> 29:35.896
- ( gasps )
- ( tires screeching )

29:36.067 --> 29:37.648
( growls )

29:39.236 --> 29:40.646
( screams )

29:56.462 --> 29:58.327
So what do we do?
Just wait for him to pass out?

29:58.506 --> 30:00.167
Just go.

30:01.592 --> 30:03.503
Just go!

30:03.678 --> 30:06.090
I promised Maggie
l'd bring you home safe.

30:06.263 --> 30:10.506
( chuckles )
Like you promised that little girl?

30:13.437 --> 30:15.814
So what's your plan?
Finish that bottle?

30:15.982 --> 30:18.143
Drink yourself to death
and leave your girls alone?

30:18.317 --> 30:22.481
Stop telling me how to care
for my family, my farm.

30:22.655 --> 30:25.317
You people are like a plague!

30:25.491 --> 30:28.324
I do the Christian thing,
give you shelter,

30:28.494 --> 30:30.701
and you destroy it all!

30:30.871 --> 30:33.362
The world was already
in bad shape when we met.

30:33.541 --> 30:35.497
And you take
no responsibility!

30:35.668 --> 30:37.374
You're supposed
to be their leader!

30:37.545 --> 30:40.378
Well, I'm here now, aren't I?

30:43.718 --> 30:45.379
Yes.

30:48.723 --> 30:50.679
Yes.

30:50.850 --> 30:52.886
Yes, you are.

31:01.902 --> 31:03.563
Come on.

31:03.738 --> 31:06.696
Your girls need you now
more than ever.

31:06.866 --> 31:09.699
I didn't want
to believe you.

31:10.911 --> 31:12.651
You told me
there was no cure,

31:12.830 --> 31:15.242
that these people
were dead, not sick.

31:15.416 --> 31:18.032
I chose not
to believe that.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.917
But when Shane
shot Lou in the chest

31:21.088 --> 31:22.828
and she just kept coming,

31:23.007 --> 31:25.874
that's when I knew
what an ass I'd been,

31:26.052 --> 31:29.886
that Annette had
been dead long ago

31:30.056 --> 31:32.092
and l was feeding
her rotten corpse!

31:32.266 --> 31:35.008
That's when I knew
there was no hope.

31:36.771 --> 31:40.730
And when that little girl
came out of the barn,

31:40.900 --> 31:43.516
the look on your face--

31:44.570 --> 31:46.606
I knew you knew it, too.

31:48.908 --> 31:50.444
Right?

31:50.618 --> 31:52.449
There is no hope.

31:53.871 --> 31:57.238
And you know it now,
like I do.

31:58.751 --> 32:00.287
Don't you?

32:05.466 --> 32:08.924
There is no hope
for any of us.

32:40.960 --> 32:42.951
- You ready?
- Yeah.

32:44.463 --> 32:46.920
Man, how many times
we gonna have to do this?

32:50.344 --> 32:53.302
Look, I'm done.
I'm not doing this anymore,

32:53.472 --> 32:56.305
cleaning up after you.
You know what the truth is?

32:56.475 --> 32:58.966
Nothing has changed.

32:59.145 --> 33:02.137
Death is death.
It's always been there,

33:02.314 --> 33:04.350
whether it's from
a heart attack, cancer,

33:04.525 --> 33:06.982
or a walker.
What's the difference?

33:07.153 --> 33:09.485
You didn't think it was hopeless
before, did you?

33:09.655 --> 33:12.271
Now there are people
back at home trying to hang on.

33:12.449 --> 33:15.816
They need us, even if it's just
to give them a reason to go on,

33:15.995 --> 33:17.951
even if we don't
believe it ourselves.

33:19.707 --> 33:22.323
You know what?
This isn't about

33:22.501 --> 33:24.617
what we believe anymore.

33:26.046 --> 33:27.707
It's about them.

33:37.892 --> 33:39.883
( door opens)

33:43.397 --> 33:46.810
Son of a bitch.
They're alive.

33:55.743 --> 33:57.529
l'm Dave.

33:57.703 --> 33:59.819
That scrawny-looking
douche bag there is Tony.

33:59.997 --> 34:02.909
- ( chuckles ) Eat me, Dave.
- Hey, maybe someday I will.

34:03.083 --> 34:05.745
We met on l-95
coming out of Philly.

34:05.920 --> 34:07.535
Damn shit-show that was.

34:07.713 --> 34:11.376
I'm Glenn. It's nice
to meet some new people.

34:11.550 --> 34:12.926
Rick Grimes.

34:14.762 --> 34:17.595
- How about you, pal? Have one?
- ljust quit.

34:17.765 --> 34:19.756
You've got a unique sense
of timing, my friend.

34:19.934 --> 34:23.677
His name's Hershel.
He lost people today, a lot of them.

34:25.189 --> 34:27.430
l'm truly sorry
to hear that.

34:28.943 --> 34:31.275
To better days
and new friends.

34:31.445 --> 34:33.401
And to our dead--

34:33.572 --> 34:35.688
may they be
in a better place.

34:38.577 --> 34:41.410
Ah. Ah.

34:45.584 --> 34:47.199
Not bad, huh?

34:49.713 --> 34:51.249
I got it off a cop.

34:51.423 --> 34:54.915
- I'm a cop.
- This one was already dead.

34:58.681 --> 35:00.546
You fellas are a long way
from Philadelphia.

35:00.724 --> 35:02.385
It feels like we're
a long way from anywhere.

35:02.559 --> 35:03.719
What drove you south?

35:03.894 --> 35:04.974
Well, I can tell you
it wasn't the weather.

35:05.145 --> 35:07.636
I must've dropped 30 pounds
in sweat alone down here.

35:07.815 --> 35:10.682
- | wish.
- Dave: No, first it was DC.

35:10.859 --> 35:12.690
I heard there might be
some kind of refugee camp,

35:12.861 --> 35:15.819
but the roads were so jammed,
we never even got close.

35:15.990 --> 35:18.697
We decided to get
off the highways, into the sticks,

35:18.867 --> 35:20.949
keep hauling ass.

35:21.120 --> 35:24.408
Every group we came across had a new
rumor about a way out of this thing.

35:24.581 --> 35:26.572
One guy told us there was
a Coast Guard center in the Gulf,

35:26.750 --> 35:28.001
sending ferries
to the islands.

35:28.168 --> 35:30.124
Dave: The latest was
a rail yard in Montgomery

35:30.296 --> 35:31.786
running trains to the middle
of the country--

35:31.964 --> 35:34.330
- Kansas, Nebraska.
- Nebraska?

35:34.508 --> 35:36.419
Low population,
lots of guns.

35:36.593 --> 35:37.799
Kinda makes sense.

35:37.970 --> 35:39.961
You ever been to Nebraska, kid?

35:40.139 --> 35:42.596
The reason they call 'em
flyover states.

35:42.766 --> 35:45.428
(Tony laughs)

35:49.273 --> 35:50.979
How about you guys?

35:51.150 --> 35:53.106
Fort Benning, eventually.

35:53.277 --> 35:57.111
I hate to piss in your cornflakes,
officer, but...

35:57.281 --> 36:00.398
we ran across a grunt
who was stationed at Benning.

36:00.576 --> 36:02.942
He said the place
was overrun by lamebrains.

36:03.120 --> 36:05.782
Wait, Fort Benning is gone?
Are you for real?

36:05.956 --> 36:08.197
Sadly, lam.

36:09.209 --> 36:12.747
Ugly truth is there is
no way out of this mess.

36:12.921 --> 36:15.833
Just keep going
from one pipe dream to the next,

36:16.008 --> 36:17.873
praying one
of these mindless freaks

36:18.052 --> 36:19.212
doesn't grab ahold
of you when you sleep.

36:19.386 --> 36:21.047
Tony:
If you sleep.

36:21.221 --> 36:23.553
Yeah, it doesn't look like you guys
are hanging your hats here.

36:23.724 --> 36:26.136
You holed up
somewhere else?

36:28.687 --> 36:30.518
Not really.

36:33.192 --> 36:34.557
Those your cars out front?

36:34.735 --> 36:37.147
Yeah. Why?

36:37.321 --> 36:38.686
We're living in ours.

36:38.864 --> 36:42.197
Thoselook
kinda empty, clean.

36:42.368 --> 36:45.781
- Where's all your gear?
- We're with a larger group.

36:45.954 --> 36:48.696
Out scouting,
thought we could use a drink.

36:53.796 --> 36:55.582
Well, we're thinking
of setting up around here.

36:55.756 --> 36:58.589
- Is it safe?
- Glenn: It can be.

36:58.759 --> 37:02.672
Although I have killed
a couple of walkers around here.

37:02.846 --> 37:04.507
Walkers?
That what you call them?

37:04.681 --> 37:07.297
- ( chuckles ) Yeah.
- That's good.

37:07.476 --> 37:09.091
I like that. I like that better
than lamebrains.

37:09.269 --> 37:10.884
Tony:
More succinct.

37:11.063 --> 37:14.180
- Okay, Tony went to college.
- Two years.

37:23.367 --> 37:25.073
So what-- so what,
you guys set up

37:25.244 --> 37:27.030
on the outskirts
or something?

37:27.204 --> 37:30.071
- That new development?
- Trailer park or something?

37:30.249 --> 37:32.535
A farm?

37:32.709 --> 37:35.200
J‘ Old McDonald had a farm. J‘

37:35.379 --> 37:38.587
- ( Tony chuckles)
- You on a farm?

37:41.009 --> 37:45.048
- ( Tony urinating)
- J‘ E-l-E-l-O. J‘

37:48.225 --> 37:50.386
Tony: Is it safe?
It's gotta be.

37:50.561 --> 37:52.847
- You got food, water?
- Tony: You got cooze?

37:53.021 --> 37:54.727
Ain't had a piece
of ass in weeks.

37:54.898 --> 37:56.229
- ( chuckles )
- Listen, pardon my friend.

37:56.400 --> 37:58.231
City kids--
they got no tact.

37:58.402 --> 37:59.892
No disrespect.

38:01.447 --> 38:03.984
- So listen, Glenn--
- We've said enough.

38:04.158 --> 38:06.991
Well, hang on a second.
This farm, it sounds pretty sweet.

38:07.161 --> 38:09.493
- Don't it sound sweet, Tony?
- Tony: Yeah, real sweet.

38:09.663 --> 38:12.951
Dave: How about a little
southern hospitality?

38:13.125 --> 38:16.788
We got some buddies back at camp,
been having a real hard time.

38:16.962 --> 38:19.578
I don't see why you can't make
room for a few more.

38:19.756 --> 38:21.292
We could pool our resources,
our manpower.

38:21.467 --> 38:23.549
Look, I'm sorry.
That's not an option.

38:29.641 --> 38:31.802
Doesn't sound
like it'd be a problem.

38:31.977 --> 38:33.308
I'm sorry. We can't.

38:33.479 --> 38:35.561
We can't take in any more.

38:36.982 --> 38:38.597
( chuckles )

38:38.775 --> 38:40.481
You guys are
something else.

38:40.652 --> 38:43.735
|thought-- I thought
we were friends.

38:46.283 --> 38:48.399
We got people
we gotta look out for, too.

38:48.577 --> 38:50.863
We don't know
anything about you.

38:51.038 --> 38:52.323
Dave:
No, that's true.

38:54.291 --> 38:56.327
You don't know
anything about us.

38:58.378 --> 39:00.630
You don't know what we've had
to go through out there.

39:02.132 --> 39:04.293
The things we've had to do.

39:07.179 --> 39:09.670
I bet you've had to do some
of those same things yourself.

39:09.848 --> 39:11.588
Am I right?

39:15.896 --> 39:19.309
'Cause ain't nobody's hands clean
in what's left of this world.

39:19.483 --> 39:21.974
We're all the same.

39:23.695 --> 39:25.310
So come on, let's--

39:25.489 --> 39:28.071
let's take a nice friendly
hayride to this farm

39:28.242 --> 39:30.233
and we'll get
to know each other.

39:33.247 --> 39:34.828
That's not gonna happen.

39:34.998 --> 39:36.738
- Rick--
- This is bullshit.

39:36.917 --> 39:38.578
- Calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down.

39:38.752 --> 39:40.913
- Don't ever tell me to calm down.
- Dave: Whoa.

39:41.088 --> 39:43.249
l'll shoot you three assholes in
the head and take your damn farm!

39:43.423 --> 39:46.210
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Relax.

39:46.385 --> 39:48.626
Take it easy.
Nobody's killing anybody.

39:48.804 --> 39:51.546
Nobody's shooting anybody.
Right, Rick?

39:56.728 --> 39:58.639
Look.

40:01.358 --> 40:03.394
We're just friends
having a drink. That's all.

40:04.861 --> 40:08.353
Now where's
the good stuff, huh?

40:08.532 --> 40:11.649
Good stuff, good stuff,
good stuff. Let's see.

40:14.121 --> 40:16.032
Hey, look at that.

40:16.206 --> 40:17.707
That'll work.

40:17.874 --> 40:21.287
(sighs)

40:21.461 --> 40:23.076
You gotta understand--

40:24.339 --> 40:26.000
we can't stay out there.

40:27.801 --> 40:29.416
You know what it's like.

40:29.595 --> 40:31.711
Yeah, I do.

40:31.888 --> 40:34.379
But the farm is
too crowded as is.

40:34.558 --> 40:37.300
I'm sorry.
You'll have to keep looking.

40:37.477 --> 40:39.513
Keep looking.

40:39.688 --> 40:41.929
Where do you suggest
we do that?

40:44.151 --> 40:45.607
I don't know.

40:45.777 --> 40:48.359
I hear Nebraska's nice.

40:48.530 --> 40:50.316
( laughs)

40:50.490 --> 40:52.105
Nebraska.

40:53.160 --> 40:55.025
This guy.

41:00.417 --> 41:02.123
( gun cocks, fires)

41:02.294 --> 41:04.285
(bodythuds)

41:10.302 --> 41:12.133
(music playing )

41:46.254 --> 41:48.119
( holsters gun )

41:48.298 --> 41:52.541
J‘ Oh, I see that lantern J‘

41:52.719 --> 41:54.255
J‘ Trimmed low J‘

41:54.429 --> 41:57.887
J‘ Burning in our home J‘

42:01.561 --> 42:06.396
J‘ And though
lfeel like crying J‘

42:06.566 --> 42:09.057
J‘ I swear tonight J‘

42:09.236 --> 42:12.399
J‘ l'll cry no more J‘

42:16.576 --> 42:17.201
J‘ Dream with the feathers of angels
stuffed beneath your head J‘

42:17.202 --> 42:21.320
J‘ Dream with the feathers of angels
stuffed beneath your head J‘

42:22.332 --> 42:26.792
J‘ The regulator's
swinging pendulum J‘

42:26.962 --> 42:32.582
J‘ Dream with the feathers of angels
stuffed beneath your head J‘

42:32.759 --> 42:37.219
J‘ The regulator's
swinging pendulum. J‘
