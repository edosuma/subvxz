WEBVTT

00:45.003 --> 00:46.403
Aah!

00:59.151 --> 01:00.951
I love a good nor'easter.
Ugh.

01:00.986 --> 01:03.720
I would love to meet the person
who installed this roof.

01:03.755 --> 01:06.990
[ water dripping,
thunder rumbles ]

01:07.025 --> 01:09.192
What are you doing here
so early?

01:09.228 --> 01:10.860
Traffic's terrible.

01:10.896 --> 01:13.897
Maura, headquarters is, like,
less than a mile away.

01:13.932 --> 01:16.466
Well, i was reviewing protocols
for hope's clinics,

01:16.501 --> 01:19.269
And i was hoping to drop them
off before work.

01:19.304 --> 01:21.538
And...VoilÃ .

01:21.573 --> 01:24.007
For you for tomorrow night.

01:24.042 --> 01:26.276
Tomorrow night?
What's tomorrow night?

01:26.311 --> 01:28.478
Oh, no. You are not
getting out of it.

01:28.513 --> 01:29.779
Getting out of what?

01:29.815 --> 01:32.215
The minuteman mystery writers
conference.

01:32.251 --> 01:33.550
You promised.

01:35.053 --> 01:38.755
Yes! That's tomorrow night.
<i>Fantastic.</i>

01:38.790 --> 01:40.290
It'll be fun.

01:40.325 --> 01:42.092
You know, there's a panel
discussion on dramatic theory.

01:42.127 --> 01:44.327
And i really believe
that the insight

01:44.363 --> 01:46.963
Of professional writers
will improve my understanding

01:46.999 --> 01:48.632
Of internal structure better.

01:48.667 --> 01:50.934
I haven't decided yet whether or
not aristotle's "poetics" or --

01:50.969 --> 01:52.769
What if it gets rained out?

01:52.804 --> 01:54.237
It's inside.

01:54.273 --> 01:57.107
Oh, great! Rizzoli.

01:57.142 --> 01:59.709
Isles.

02:21.233 --> 02:24.668
[ thunder rumbles,
rain falling ]

02:29.241 --> 02:32.575
[ camera shutter clicking,
radio chatter ]

02:32.611 --> 02:35.879
Jennie tate, 32.

02:35.914 --> 02:38.982
What is a patient doing
in here?

02:39.017 --> 02:40.517
And frankly,
where the hell is here?

02:40.552 --> 02:42.185
Here is a new cancer wing.

02:42.220 --> 02:44.954
Whole building's been closed
for four months for renovation.

02:44.990 --> 02:47.824
Jennie was an overnight
chemotherapy patient

02:47.859 --> 02:49.426
In the adjoining building.

02:49.461 --> 02:53.163
A nurse came in and changed
her iv at 3:45 this morning.

02:53.198 --> 02:57.000
When she looked in on her again
at 6:45, jennie was gone.

02:57.035 --> 02:58.968
Right around the time
the workers found her.

02:59.004 --> 03:00.403
She may have been exercising.

03:00.439 --> 03:02.005
You know, a recent article

03:02.040 --> 03:03.973
In the "journal of oncology"
suggests that moderate exercise

03:04.009 --> 03:07.043
Can improve the effects
of chemotherapy.

03:07.079 --> 03:08.945
Any reports of her
going for a walk?

03:08.980 --> 03:11.114
No.
Any cameras?

03:11.149 --> 03:13.516
No cameras, and no one
saw her leave the ward.

03:14.853 --> 03:16.953
We have lights coming.

03:16.988 --> 03:19.989
The impalement appears to be
the only injury.

03:20.025 --> 03:22.592
You know, she may have fallen,
but i can't be sure until i --

03:22.627 --> 03:24.561
Until you perform
the autopsy.

03:24.596 --> 03:26.863
Very funny, but true.

03:26.898 --> 03:29.866
What's with the white rose?
Was she carrying that?

03:29.901 --> 03:31.468
No one i interviewed
mentioned it.

03:31.503 --> 03:33.002
Find out if there were roses
in jennie's room.

03:33.038 --> 03:35.205
If there were,
find out who sent 'em.

03:47.786 --> 03:49.219
Jane.
Hey.

03:49.254 --> 03:50.987
Frankie said jennie
didn't have flowers in her room.

03:51.022 --> 03:52.989
What about the other patients?

03:53.024 --> 03:55.692
No flowers.
So where'd this white rose
come from?

03:55.727 --> 03:57.160
Push the button.

03:57.195 --> 03:59.028
Push the button.
Push the button.

03:59.064 --> 04:01.164
Why?
'cause he's right behind me.

04:01.199 --> 04:03.299
Who?
Who?
Him!

04:05.404 --> 04:06.970
Oh! Hey. Wait.

04:07.005 --> 04:08.438
Hey.

04:08.473 --> 04:10.940
Hey!
Ah...

04:10.976 --> 04:12.942
uh, sorry.

04:21.553 --> 04:24.554
You're running from him because
he invited you to a concert?

04:24.589 --> 04:29.092
Yes. I went to his house for
what he called "the big game."

04:29.127 --> 04:31.194
Do you know he does taxidermy?

04:31.229 --> 04:32.595
Taxidermy?

04:32.631 --> 04:34.564
Oh, yeah. Little mice.

04:34.599 --> 04:36.833
He even has a favorite --
st. Kilda.

04:36.868 --> 04:40.103
All right, well,
i mean, you know, that's...

04:40.138 --> 04:41.971
Odd, but harmless.

04:42.007 --> 04:44.407
He dresses them up
in seasonal costumes.

04:44.443 --> 04:46.976
Skiing, surfing, leaf raking.

04:47.012 --> 04:48.278
Back to the game. Sox?

04:48.313 --> 04:50.346
The national shinty
championships.

04:50.382 --> 04:52.982
Kent was wearing a jersey
and a kilt.

04:53.018 --> 04:55.718
Well, special occasional,
championship and all.

04:55.754 --> 04:58.221
Yeah. That's -- that's normal.

04:58.256 --> 04:59.355
He had one for me.

04:59.391 --> 05:00.690
A jersey?

05:00.725 --> 05:01.925
I wish.
Unh-unh.

05:01.960 --> 05:04.227
At least he didn't
have one for his mouse.

05:04.262 --> 05:05.662
Wrong again, friend.

05:05.697 --> 05:07.430
Oh, yeah.

05:07.466 --> 05:09.032
Come on.

05:09.067 --> 05:11.067
Detective rizzoli, there's
a woman here with information

05:11.102 --> 05:12.802
About the homicide
at the hospital.

05:12.838 --> 05:15.205
Okay. Um, where is she?
The interview room?

05:15.240 --> 05:17.540
Interrogation room.
Interview room's flooded.

05:17.576 --> 05:19.242
All right, thanks.

05:20.345 --> 05:21.811
Samantha caspary?

05:23.281 --> 05:24.714
[ telephone ringing
in distance ]

05:32.224 --> 05:34.858
Um...

05:34.893 --> 05:38.328
Hi. I'm detective rizzoli.
This is sergeant --

05:38.363 --> 05:39.662
what can you
tell me about the murder

05:39.698 --> 05:41.197
At the mallon hospital?

05:41.233 --> 05:42.599
...Detective korsak.

05:42.634 --> 05:44.234
Was she a patient?

05:44.269 --> 05:45.802
Where was the body found?
Was she thrown from the roof?

05:45.837 --> 05:47.437
Are you a relative
or a friend?

05:47.472 --> 05:49.072
What? No. No, no.

05:49.107 --> 05:51.875
So, what is your interest
in this case?

05:51.910 --> 05:55.111
so sorry.
I tend to get carried away.

05:55.146 --> 05:57.847
I'm in town for
the mystery writers conference.

05:57.883 --> 05:59.849
So you're a writer.

05:59.885 --> 06:02.452
Yes, which is why when i heard
about your case,

06:02.487 --> 06:03.686
I just had to come in.

06:03.722 --> 06:06.823
Okay. Um...

06:06.858 --> 06:09.225
We don't do interviews.

06:09.261 --> 06:13.563
So i'll, uh, get an officer
and he'll escort you...

06:13.598 --> 06:15.098
But i can help you...
...To the front.

06:15.133 --> 06:17.300
...If you just tell me
about the case.

06:17.335 --> 06:18.968
Uh, i think
you're a little bit confused.

06:19.004 --> 06:21.204
<i>We</i> ask the questions.

06:21.239 --> 06:23.306
How is it exactly you think
you can help us?

06:23.341 --> 06:25.408
I know who did it.

06:25.443 --> 06:27.644
You do.

06:27.679 --> 06:29.145
The victim was impaled, right?

06:30.148 --> 06:32.215
And the killer
left flowers behind.

06:32.250 --> 06:34.050
Just cut to the chase,
ms. Caspary.

06:34.853 --> 06:38.454
You are
looking for a ghost.

06:48.575 --> 06:53.244
As the story goes, hannah rose
was a patient at the hospital.

06:53.279 --> 06:54.946
Angered by her untimely death,

06:54.981 --> 06:58.316
She came back as a ghost
and killed several people.

06:58.351 --> 06:59.884
How many is several?

06:59.919 --> 07:01.319
I don't know.

07:01.354 --> 07:02.787
I heard the story secondhand.

07:02.822 --> 07:05.089
Actually,
it might've been third-hand

07:05.124 --> 07:07.024
On a visit to the u.S.
Long time ago.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.827
And i was told that the doctor
who was treating the patients

07:09.862 --> 07:12.630
Was found impaled
on an iron post.

07:12.665 --> 07:15.833
Multiple murders,
a ghost killer --

07:15.868 --> 07:18.002
Sounds like something
i would've heard about,

07:18.037 --> 07:19.637
But i haven't.
Nobody has,

07:19.672 --> 07:22.173
Which is why it's too much
of a coincidence

07:22.208 --> 07:24.008
To be...Coincidence.

07:24.043 --> 07:26.577
Okay, i'll have someone
look into the story.

07:26.613 --> 07:27.612
Great.

07:27.647 --> 07:29.513
I can't find anything
in writing,

07:29.549 --> 07:30.748
And the mallon hospital

07:30.783 --> 07:33.217
Won't let me anywhere
near their archives.

07:33.252 --> 07:34.919
So you thought
you'd come to us

07:34.954 --> 07:37.054
And we'd look
in the archives for you?

07:37.090 --> 07:40.825
Well, i must confess,
i was rather hoping

07:40.860 --> 07:42.793
That my information
would help you,

07:42.829 --> 07:45.229
And you would return
the favor.

07:45.264 --> 07:47.665
Mm.

07:50.703 --> 07:54.071
Hey. Anything helpful
from the caspary woman?

07:54.107 --> 07:56.974
Oh, yeah, if we're looking for
the headless horseman

07:57.010 --> 07:59.810
Or if we're gonna take a ride
in the mystery machine?

07:59.846 --> 08:01.479
No.

08:01.514 --> 08:03.914
okay,
what have we got so far?

08:03.950 --> 08:06.951
Well, jennie tate was
a data entry clerk

08:06.986 --> 08:08.586
With an insurance company.

08:08.621 --> 08:10.154
Now because of her illness,

08:10.189 --> 08:12.556
She was on extended sick leave
for the last six months.

08:12.592 --> 08:13.891
Husband?

08:13.926 --> 08:17.028
Charles. He's an actuary
with the same company.

08:17.063 --> 08:20.331
Co-worker said they were good,
hard-working people.

08:20.366 --> 08:22.333
What about the hospital?

08:22.368 --> 08:25.036
No threats or any other
violent incidents.

08:25.071 --> 08:27.772
Nina's still running background
on the employees.

08:27.807 --> 08:31.175
Will you have nina check
the other patients

08:31.210 --> 08:33.210
In jennie's
chemotherapy group?

08:33.246 --> 08:34.779
Yeah.
All right.

08:42.055 --> 08:45.856
<i>Those archives could hold</i>
<i>the key to a fascinating story.</i>

08:45.892 --> 08:48.159
<i>That might be true, but this is</i>
<i>a homicide investigation...</i>

08:48.194 --> 08:49.560
Hi. You looking for me?
No.

08:49.595 --> 08:51.929
you've got samantha caspary.

08:51.964 --> 08:53.597
Mm-hmm.

08:53.633 --> 08:57.468
Samantha caspary,
potential crazy person.

08:57.503 --> 09:00.938
oh, no, no, no. She is an author
with a phd from oxford.

09:00.973 --> 09:05.076
Wrote a captivating best-selling
biography on dr. Joseph bell.

09:05.111 --> 09:06.644
The scottish lecturer

09:06.679 --> 09:08.412
Who was the inspiration
for sherlock holmes.

09:08.448 --> 09:10.181
If i say, "wow, i'd really
love to read that,"

09:10.216 --> 09:11.415
Can we talk about the case?

09:11.451 --> 09:13.617
Jennie tate was
in partial remission.

09:13.653 --> 09:17.288
Her cancer was responding to a
rather new combination of drugs.

09:17.323 --> 09:18.689
Did the drugs
cause her death?

09:18.725 --> 09:19.890
The drug levels
in her blood

09:19.926 --> 09:21.759
Were well below
fatal toxicity levels.

09:21.794 --> 09:24.161
Also, there was no evidence
of sexual assault.

09:24.197 --> 09:25.563
And the degree
of blunt force trauma

09:25.598 --> 09:26.897
Is consistent with a fall.

09:26.933 --> 09:28.599
What about that giant piece
of iron bar

09:28.634 --> 09:29.934
Sticking out of her chest?

09:29.969 --> 09:31.535
Did that have anything to do
with her death?

09:31.571 --> 09:33.604
Well, technically, that was
the instrumentality,

09:33.639 --> 09:35.406
But the cause of death
was drowning.

09:35.441 --> 09:36.974
The bar pierced her
pulmonary artery,

09:37.009 --> 09:39.410
Her lungs filled with blood,
and she drowned.

09:41.814 --> 09:43.581
Could this have been
an accident?

09:43.616 --> 09:47.017
Well, those drugs do produce
a mild state of disorientation.

09:47.053 --> 09:49.787
So it seemed possible,
until i noticed this.

09:49.822 --> 09:53.190
These small lacerations
couldn't be seen earlier

09:53.226 --> 09:54.592
Because they didn't bleed.

09:54.627 --> 09:56.794
These are from the rose.
Yes.

09:56.829 --> 09:58.529
So our killer watched
jennie die

09:58.564 --> 10:00.898
And then pressed her hand
around the rose.

10:02.935 --> 10:05.136
It's not an accident
or a ghost.

10:19.385 --> 10:21.552
Excuse me. Dr. Isles?

10:21.587 --> 10:23.754
Yei'
santha caspary.

10:23.790 --> 10:26.390
I know who you are.
It is a pleasure to meet you.

10:26.425 --> 10:28.759
I've always wanted
to meet you.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.694
I do hope i'm not being
too forward,

10:30.730 --> 10:32.763
But do you have time
for a coffee?

10:32.799 --> 10:33.831
I really don't.

10:33.866 --> 10:36.333
Of course.
You must be so busy.

10:36.369 --> 10:40.171
It's just that i have read
so many of your forensic papers.

10:40.206 --> 10:41.972
Really?
Oh, yes.

10:42.008 --> 10:44.675
Your paper on the effect of
immersion on the rate of decay

10:44.710 --> 10:45.910
Could've been a short story.

10:45.945 --> 10:49.313
Do you do any other kind
of writing?

10:49.348 --> 10:51.549
Well, i have written
a few short stories

10:51.584 --> 10:53.184
For my creative writing
class.

10:53.219 --> 10:56.787
Aha. Well, i'm here for
the writers conference.

10:56.823 --> 10:59.323
Maybe we could meet for dinner
or drinks?

10:59.358 --> 11:02.993
I could pick your brain, and you
can show me your short stories.

11:03.029 --> 11:05.095
I'd love that.

11:09.535 --> 11:11.135
<i>Ultrasound to radiology...</i>

11:11.170 --> 11:14.705
Our killer used this building's
history to cover a murder.

11:14.740 --> 11:16.774
I cannot understand
how people believe in ghosts.

11:16.809 --> 11:19.176
They're just trying to deal
with the finality of death.

11:19.212 --> 11:20.511
Probably understand it
a lot more

11:20.546 --> 11:21.846
If they saw
what we saw every day.

11:21.881 --> 11:24.315
Oh, that might be
too much understanding.

11:24.350 --> 11:25.683
But i don't think
it's crazy

11:25.718 --> 11:27.551
To believe in
a certain life force

11:27.587 --> 11:29.386
That doesn't die
with a physical body.

11:29.422 --> 11:31.822
oh, i didn't know you and kiki
joined a cult.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.691
That's pretty strong words
for someone who followed

11:33.726 --> 11:36.427
The departed barry frost
all over town.

11:37.830 --> 11:39.830
I just saw him
'cause i wanted to see him.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.866
Or maybe it's that energy
i'm talking about.

11:41.901 --> 11:43.434
We've all felt it
one time or another,

11:43.469 --> 11:45.736
Whether we want to
admit it or not.

11:47.106 --> 11:48.772
I miss him.

11:48.808 --> 11:50.107
Me, too.

11:53.079 --> 11:55.279
Jennie tate was part of
a cancer drug program

11:55.314 --> 11:57.948
That mallon hospital recently
agreed to underwrite.

11:57.984 --> 12:00.517
We understand that
she was in remission.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.319
She was one of our first
success stories.

12:02.355 --> 12:04.722
And we all feel terrible
about the incident.

12:06.659 --> 12:10.027
It wasn't an incident,
ms. Najafi. It was a homicide.

12:11.197 --> 12:12.363
A homicide?

12:12.398 --> 12:15.266
Yes. What did you think
happened?

12:15.301 --> 12:17.534
I don't know,
a-a terrible accident.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.236
We're gonna need jennie's
medical records,

12:19.272 --> 12:21.538
The hospital security log,
list of all employees.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.874
I need to call
our legal department.

12:23.910 --> 12:26.677
While you're at it, could you
tell them we also need

12:26.712 --> 12:28.746
Their records
of any lawsuits pending,

12:28.781 --> 12:30.781
Any threats against
the hospital or staff?

12:30.816 --> 12:34.518
Anything that would make the
hospital a target for revenge.

12:34.553 --> 12:36.220
Wait. You think this could
have something to do

12:36.255 --> 12:38.622
With the hospital?
We do.

12:38.658 --> 12:41.392
Are you familiar with
the hateful hannah story?

12:43.062 --> 12:46.096
One of our senior board members
told me that ridiculous tale.

12:46.132 --> 12:48.432
Can we speak to him, please?
He's no longer with us.

12:48.467 --> 12:50.134
Do you know where we can
find him?

12:50.169 --> 12:52.569
I'm sorry. I mean, he died.

12:52.605 --> 12:56.707
Uh, like i said, he was
a <i> senio</i> board member.

12:56.742 --> 12:58.776
Does anybody else know
the story?

12:58.811 --> 13:01.478
I hope not. It could ruin
our hospital.

13:01.514 --> 13:03.948
Really? A ghost story?
Please stop saying "ghost."

13:03.983 --> 13:06.884
In 1905, that story nearly
caused the financial ruin

13:06.919 --> 13:08.252
Of this hospital.

13:08.287 --> 13:09.520
That was a long time ago,
ms. Najafi.

13:09.555 --> 13:10.821
People will come back
to a hospital

13:10.856 --> 13:12.289
If they get an infection,
sergeant.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.325
In fact, it's expected.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.193
But no one will come to
a haunted hospital.

13:16.228 --> 13:18.462
We'll be discreet, but we have
to check out every lead,

13:18.497 --> 13:20.864
Even if it involves a story
none of us believes.

13:24.170 --> 13:25.536
Yes?

13:27.807 --> 13:30.207
A nurse heard screams coming
from the renovation site.

13:30.242 --> 13:32.876
Our security guard
won't go near it.

13:32.912 --> 13:35.312
To the right?

14:06.812 --> 14:09.413
shit!

14:15.087 --> 14:16.754
Jane.

14:29.243 --> 14:32.178
P ]

14:35.116 --> 14:36.716
[ telephone ringing
in distance ]

14:36.751 --> 14:39.652
Russell morgan, the oncologist
in jennie tate's treatment.

14:39.687 --> 14:42.254
If someone wanted dr. Morgan
and jennie tate dead,

14:42.290 --> 14:43.389
There are easier ways.

14:43.424 --> 14:45.124
Why the elaborate scheme?

14:45.159 --> 14:47.426
To throw suspicion
off themselves,

14:47.462 --> 14:50.396
Like blaming cousin larry.
Except ghosts don't exists.

14:50.431 --> 14:52.698
True, which probably means
someone's trying to get back

14:52.734 --> 14:55.234
At the hospital for some reason
we haven't discovered yet.

14:55.269 --> 14:57.470
Hey, the construction
on the new wing

14:57.505 --> 14:59.472
Is three months behind
schedule.

14:59.507 --> 15:01.774
Well, the contract might've had
a penalty for late completion.

15:01.809 --> 15:04.110
Which would be invalid
if the hospital contributed

15:04.145 --> 15:06.379
To the delays because of,
oh, i don't know,

15:06.414 --> 15:08.114
A murder investigation?

15:08.149 --> 15:10.116
I'll look into it
first thing in the morning.

15:10.151 --> 15:12.184
Hey, frankie,
why don't you and i stay

15:12.220 --> 15:13.786
On jennie tate
and dr. Morgan?

15:13.821 --> 15:16.188
Can you ask nina to check for
any malpractice lawsuits?

15:16.224 --> 15:20.026
Maybe somebody was unhappy with
the care they received.

15:21.429 --> 15:23.796
Why don't you just tell kent
you don't want to go?

15:23.831 --> 15:25.064
It's not that easy.

15:25.099 --> 15:27.233
Kent has this way
of making me feel bad.

15:27.268 --> 15:29.001
Then go.
It's just a couple hours.

15:29.037 --> 15:31.237
Will you go with me?
No.

15:31.272 --> 15:33.906
You see how easy that was?

15:37.912 --> 15:42.281
Okay. Maura is done
with dr. Morgan's autopsy.

15:42.316 --> 15:45.851
Hey, what do you think about
this samantha caspary?

15:45.887 --> 15:47.853
Our nosy writer?
Mm-hmm.

15:47.889 --> 15:50.356
A few ghost murders would be
good for future book sales.

15:50.391 --> 15:52.258
Yeah, but why walk in here
and tell us about

15:52.293 --> 15:54.293
The ghost stories if she's
the one behind it all?

15:54.328 --> 15:55.895
Maybe the creepy
he from the deep

15:55.930 --> 15:57.363
Told her to do it,

15:57.398 --> 15:58.964
Or maybe she's just dumber
than we think she is.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.599
She gave us an alibi.

16:00.635 --> 16:02.802
She said she was on the train
from new york arriving at 7:30.

16:02.837 --> 16:04.303
We're still confirming it.

16:04.338 --> 16:06.038
But telling a lie that specific
would be really dumb.

16:06.074 --> 16:10.076
Were you in the room with her...
Okay, i'm gonna see maura.

16:13.281 --> 16:15.281
Hi.
Oh, good.

16:15.316 --> 16:17.116
I wanted to give you
the autopsy results

16:17.151 --> 16:18.484
Before i left.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.720
Okay.

16:20.755 --> 16:22.321
Overdose.

16:22.356 --> 16:24.223
Well, there was a needle mark
on the back of his neck,

16:24.258 --> 16:26.592
Which was the injection site
for the same cancer drugs

16:26.627 --> 16:28.227
That he was using
on his patients.

16:28.262 --> 16:30.663
His heart stopped within seconds
of being injected.

16:30.698 --> 16:33.265
Who would have access
to those drugs?

16:33.301 --> 16:35.701
I requested an inventory
from the hospital,

16:35.737 --> 16:39.105
But in the meantime, i'm running
tests on another theory.

16:39.140 --> 16:41.407
You're not gonna tell me
the theory, are you?

16:41.442 --> 16:43.142
No, not until the tests
are complete.

16:43.177 --> 16:44.877
Oh, maura!

16:44.912 --> 16:49.448
Oh. I've got to go. I'm having
drinks with samantha.

16:50.551 --> 16:54.086
Samantha? The woman that thinks
that ghosts murder people?

16:54.122 --> 16:55.888
Well, she doesn't really
think that.

16:55.923 --> 16:58.624
I mean, she's just tracking
an interesting story.

16:58.659 --> 17:02.261
Okay, 'cause she doesn't
seem very...

17:02.296 --> 17:03.529
What?

17:03.564 --> 17:05.631
Sane.

17:05.666 --> 17:08.234
Well, if she's not crazy,
she's up to something.

17:08.269 --> 17:11.003
All right,
well, i'll be careful.

17:19.847 --> 17:22.648
I love it.

17:22.683 --> 17:24.950
I sense a "but" coming.

17:24.986 --> 17:26.118
No "but."

17:26.154 --> 17:27.987
I have read
published authors

17:28.022 --> 17:30.256
Whose first drafts
aren't this polished.

17:30.291 --> 17:32.491
Really?
Yes, really.

17:32.527 --> 17:35.628
Have you ever thought about
trying something longer?

17:35.663 --> 17:37.963
A novel, perhaps?

17:37.999 --> 17:39.932
I have.

17:39.967 --> 17:43.102
I would love to put you
in touch with my editors.

17:43.137 --> 17:47.006
Oh!

17:47.041 --> 17:49.875
Dessert for my favorite
medical examiner

17:49.911 --> 17:51.377
And her friend.

17:51.412 --> 17:54.747
Double chocolate lava cake.
And is that vintage port?

17:54.782 --> 17:56.549
Well, if vintage means, um,

17:56.584 --> 17:59.084
Sitting on the shelf
for a really long time?

18:00.521 --> 18:03.088
This is angela,
detective rizzoli's mother.

18:03.124 --> 18:05.024
Samantha's in town for
the writer's conference.

18:05.059 --> 18:07.359
How do you do?
Pleasure to meet you.

18:07.395 --> 18:10.062
I can see where the detective
gets her beauty.

18:10.097 --> 18:12.698
Oh, i like her.

18:12.733 --> 18:14.667
Writer?
Yes. Yes.

18:14.702 --> 18:16.101
Maura's a writer.

18:16.137 --> 18:18.070
Ah.
I write. There's a difference.

18:20.274 --> 18:22.208
Hounds are calling.

18:24.879 --> 18:26.979
Are you always
this modest?

18:27.014 --> 18:28.380
No.

18:28.416 --> 18:29.782
But let's talk about you.

18:29.817 --> 18:32.985
You know, i am amazed
at the attention to detail

18:33.020 --> 18:34.420
In your stories.

18:34.455 --> 18:36.121
How do you get
your inspiration?

18:36.157 --> 18:38.657
Research, research,
research.

18:38.693 --> 18:41.160
When i wrote "the detective
doctor of edinburgh,"

18:41.195 --> 18:42.695
I moved to edinburgh

18:42.730 --> 18:44.597
So that i could be completely
immersed in his world.

18:44.632 --> 18:46.532
I wanted to write about
joseph bell,

18:46.567 --> 18:48.567
So i learned everything
i possibly could

18:48.603 --> 18:50.402
About his father,
et cetera.

18:50.438 --> 18:52.104
The story behind the story.

18:52.139 --> 18:53.439
Like hateful hannah.

18:53.474 --> 18:55.474
That ghost story
isn't real.

18:55.509 --> 18:59.311
Something happened, and people
attached a ghost to it.

18:59.347 --> 19:01.881
I might never know why,
but, oh, well.

19:01.916 --> 19:04.750
We can't always have the answers
to our questions, can we?

19:06.320 --> 19:09.488
I look forward to reading
your first novel.

19:19.467 --> 19:22.334
Thank you.
Oh, keep the change.

19:24.405 --> 19:26.705
This storm doesn't let up soon,
i'm buying a bigger boat.

19:26.741 --> 19:28.374
Oh, thank you.

19:28.409 --> 19:30.075
Any luck running down
the fired employees?

19:30.111 --> 19:32.978
Uh, yeah. They all alibied up.
Uh, what about the contractor?

19:33.014 --> 19:34.480
Oh, he's not our killer.

19:34.515 --> 19:36.949
Guy pays a 15% penalty for every
day over the finish date,

19:36.984 --> 19:38.651
Regardless of the reason.

19:38.686 --> 19:41.287
Pretty steep.
Mm.

19:41.322 --> 19:42.621
And three accidents
and two murders

19:42.657 --> 19:44.356
Won't help him keep his crew
together either.

19:44.392 --> 19:46.125
What about samantha caspary?

19:46.160 --> 19:47.526
Conductor saw her
on the train

19:47.561 --> 19:49.261
The time
of jennie tate's murder.

19:49.297 --> 19:51.063
All right, i'll tell maura.

19:51.098 --> 19:53.732
Oh, no bother. I told her.
She asked me to do

19:53.768 --> 19:55.467
A more in-depth background
check on her.

19:55.503 --> 19:56.769
Oh, yeah?

19:56.804 --> 19:58.504
Yeah, she said she wanted
to address<i> your</i> concerns.

19:58.539 --> 20:00.406
You can relax. Caspary's legit.

20:00.441 --> 20:03.008
Okay.
Frankie's got something.

20:04.278 --> 20:06.812
Come on, paddington.
Let's go find him.

20:15.723 --> 20:16.822
You looking for me?

20:16.857 --> 20:18.424
Yeah. Take a look at this.

20:18.459 --> 20:20.859
We searched through all
the legal actions filed against

20:20.895 --> 20:22.928
The mallon hospital
in the last five years.

20:22.964 --> 20:25.297
You find anything?
Oh, the usual
patient complaints --

20:25.333 --> 20:27.833
Insurance coverages, food,
rude nurses.

20:27.868 --> 20:30.369
No one with an ax to grind.
No credible threats.

20:30.404 --> 20:32.204
So what am i supposed
to be looking at?

20:32.239 --> 20:34.473
This.

20:34.508 --> 20:36.208
So i couldn't find anyone
with a good reason

20:36.243 --> 20:37.977
To hurt jennie tate
or dr. Morgan.

20:38.012 --> 20:42.047
But we did find a lot of calls
between the two of them

20:42.083 --> 20:43.515
Over the last couple of months.

20:43.551 --> 20:45.351
Nothing unusual there.
He was her doctor.

20:45.386 --> 20:46.585
That's what we thought,
too.

20:46.620 --> 20:48.687
Then we noticed that
her husband, charles,

20:48.723 --> 20:51.657
Never called dr. Morgan...

20:51.692 --> 20:53.459
Until...

20:53.494 --> 20:54.860
The night
of his wife's murder.

20:54.895 --> 20:57.062
Could be he was concerned
about his wife.

20:57.098 --> 21:00.399
Or maybe he just found out
about this.

21:00.434 --> 21:02.534
the state road motel?

21:02.570 --> 21:04.536
This is the guest log
from three months ago.

21:04.572 --> 21:07.439
Dr. Morgan and jennie tate...

21:07.475 --> 21:09.341
...Stayed at the same hotel
on the same night.

21:09.377 --> 21:10.809
What are the odds of that?

21:10.845 --> 21:14.747
Pretty damn good if
they were having an affair.

21:22.698 --> 21:24.531
Just a few things
we need to clear up.

21:24.566 --> 21:26.533
okay.

21:26.568 --> 21:29.536
When did you find out your wife
was having an affair?

21:29.571 --> 21:33.340
What? An -- an affair?

21:33.375 --> 21:34.608
I don't hear you denying it.

21:34.643 --> 21:36.176
What the hell are you
talking about?

21:36.211 --> 21:38.578
She -- she had cancer,
for god's sake.

21:38.614 --> 21:40.847
That's not the point.
That's enough.

21:40.882 --> 21:42.749
Where were you the night
your wife died?

21:42.784 --> 21:46.586
At home
until the detectives came

21:46.622 --> 21:49.155
To tell me jennie was dead.

21:49.191 --> 21:51.224
Was there anyone there?
Someone who can verify that?

21:51.259 --> 21:52.892
No.

21:52.928 --> 21:54.294
Did you go back to
the hospital at any point?

21:54.329 --> 21:55.929
No.

21:55.964 --> 21:57.631
Why'd you call dr. Morgan
that night?

21:57.666 --> 21:59.232
To check on jennie.

21:59.267 --> 22:00.767
Are you sure it wasn't
to confront him

22:00.802 --> 22:02.502
About screwing your wife?

22:02.537 --> 22:05.705
You think my wife was having
an affair with dr. Morgan?

22:07.142 --> 22:10.710
They spent the weekend together
in new hampshire.

22:10.746 --> 22:12.846
It happens. The doctor/patient
relationship --

22:12.881 --> 22:14.681
It's a strong bond.

22:16.184 --> 22:19.052
I knew about this.
It's not what you think.

22:19.087 --> 22:21.054
Tell me what i should think,
charles.

22:23.025 --> 22:26.159
Local hospitals wouldn't approve
the use of a new drug cocktail.

22:26.194 --> 22:28.762
Too much liability,
they said.

22:28.797 --> 22:31.564
So dr. Morgan treated jennie
at a private clinic

22:31.600 --> 22:33.600
In new hampshire.

22:33.635 --> 22:35.335
Until...
Until mallon hospital agreed

22:35.370 --> 22:38.171
To let him give the drugs
to his patients.

22:39.441 --> 22:42.876
You were right about
one thing, detectives.

22:42.911 --> 22:45.945
My wife
did love dr. Morgan.

22:45.981 --> 22:48.648
So did i.
He was saving her.

22:48.684 --> 22:50.417
I have no idea
why they were killed,

22:50.452 --> 22:53.420
And it seems like
you don't either, so...

22:53.455 --> 22:55.255
Unless i'm under arrest...

23:06.868 --> 23:10.603
[ telephone ringing
in distance ]

23:12.140 --> 23:14.841
We worked charles tate
pretty hard,

23:14.876 --> 23:17.143
A guy
who just lost his wife.

23:17.179 --> 23:19.846
I really hate that part
of the job.

23:19.881 --> 23:21.448
So his story checked out?

23:21.483 --> 23:23.483
Yep. Back to square one.

23:23.518 --> 23:26.086
all right, well,

23:26.121 --> 23:28.254
The contractor had
no motive.

23:28.290 --> 23:30.957
None of the hospital employees
held any grudges.

23:30.992 --> 23:32.392
Charles tate didn't do it.

23:32.427 --> 23:35.261
Yeah, so it's...It's gotta be
about the hospital.

23:35.297 --> 23:37.097
Who would want to shut down
a hospital?

23:37.132 --> 23:40.133
Well, whoever it is may have
enough of the cancer drugs

23:40.168 --> 23:42.469
To kill at least
three more people.

23:42.504 --> 23:45.872
The drugs that killed dr. Morgan
were from jennie's iv bag?

23:45.907 --> 23:47.307
Yes, and by my calculations,

23:47.342 --> 23:49.843
There's still 150ccs missing
from the bag.

23:49.878 --> 23:51.311
That's enough to kill
three people?

23:51.346 --> 23:53.146
Well, in a measured amount
such as an iv drip,

23:53.181 --> 23:55.548
It's completely safe, but in
a concentrated dose,

23:55.584 --> 23:57.083
It could result
in immediate death.

23:57.119 --> 23:58.818
I'll call the hospital
and have them keep an eye

23:58.854 --> 24:00.153
On dr. Morgan's
other patients.

24:03.992 --> 24:06.459
So the rose,
the impalement...

24:06.495 --> 24:09.662
Somebody has to know
the details of this ghost story.

24:09.698 --> 24:11.364
Didn't samantha caspary
mention something

24:11.399 --> 24:12.699
About hospital archives?

24:12.734 --> 24:14.300
I could send a c.S.R.U. Team
down there.

24:14.336 --> 24:15.935
Okay.

24:15.971 --> 24:17.871
If somebody did go through
the files from the early 1900s,

24:17.906 --> 24:19.372
There may be trace evidence.

24:19.407 --> 24:22.075
You know, i might ask
samantha caspary to join me.

24:22.110 --> 24:24.844
Why?
Well, if there's
no trace evidence,

24:24.880 --> 24:26.813
It still might make sense
to go through the documents.

24:26.848 --> 24:29.182
And her phd was in
the evolution of baptism

24:29.217 --> 24:31.284
In the english
medieval church.

24:31.319 --> 24:32.452
Uh-huh.

24:32.487 --> 24:34.053
Which means that she's gone
through thousands

24:34.089 --> 24:35.989
Of ancient records to build
and test her theory.

24:36.024 --> 24:38.992
Oh. So you're saying that
she has good research skills

24:39.027 --> 24:40.960
And she's not allergic
to dust.

24:40.996 --> 24:43.463
Exactly. And it wouldn't be
the first time i've enlisted

24:43.498 --> 24:44.597
An expert's opinion.

24:44.633 --> 24:46.232
You okay with this?

24:46.268 --> 24:48.301
Sure, as long as she signs
a nondisclosure agreement.

24:48.336 --> 24:51.471
Even if they find something,
she won't be able to use it.

24:51.506 --> 24:54.874
All right.
Done.

24:59.181 --> 25:02.081
[ siren wailing in distance,

recently,

25:13.995 --> 25:15.695
My team will know about it.

thank you so much
for including me.

25:18.066 --> 25:20.099
We're finished in here.
No fresh latents.

25:20.135 --> 25:22.602
I doubt anyone's been near
those shelves in 20 years.

25:22.637 --> 25:26.539
Thank you. I'll see you
back at the lab.

25:26.575 --> 25:29.209
So...I suppose that's it.

25:29.244 --> 25:31.978
Well, i've been thinking
about what you said.

25:32.013 --> 25:34.848
The story behind the story?
Exactly.

25:34.883 --> 25:37.116
Maybe there is something
to the hannah rose case

25:37.152 --> 25:39.152
That relates
to the present-day murders.

25:39.187 --> 25:41.521
But there's no way
to really know

25:41.556 --> 25:43.690
Unless we go through
these files.

25:43.725 --> 25:45.325
Are you serious?

25:45.360 --> 25:47.193
I brought gloves.

25:58.306 --> 26:00.273

26:02.277 --> 26:03.176
I'm trying to avoid kent.

26:03.211 --> 26:05.278
Well, if you keep dripping
on my bar,

26:05.313 --> 26:07.413
You can avoid him outside.

26:07.449 --> 26:10.683
Oh.

26:10.719 --> 26:14.287
Why are you avoiding him?

26:14.322 --> 26:16.422
He wants me to go
to a concert with him.

26:16.458 --> 26:18.191
Nice. What concert?

26:18.226 --> 26:19.692
That's just it.
I don't know.

26:19.728 --> 26:21.427
I don't want to spend

and harps.

26:25.734 --> 26:27.634
Oh, come on.
We're all a little weird.

26:27.669 --> 26:29.135
Well, you don't know
the half of it.

26:29.170 --> 26:30.904
Well, i know
he's the new kid in town.

26:30.939 --> 26:32.372
He got here a year ago.

26:32.407 --> 26:34.574
And probably doesn't have
a lot of friends, frankie.

26:34.609 --> 26:35.875
That's on him.

26:35.911 --> 26:38.077
You could be nice to him.

26:38.113 --> 26:40.113
Yeah.
That's what nina said.

26:40.148 --> 26:42.982
Good advice.
You should listen to her.

26:43.018 --> 26:47.320
You remember how i became
den mother for the cub scouts?

26:47.355 --> 26:48.855
Yeah. You loved it.

26:48.890 --> 26:51.591
No, i did not love it.

26:51.626 --> 26:53.893
I did that so that at least
once a week

26:53.929 --> 26:56.529
You would have some friends.

26:56.564 --> 26:58.932
Get out. No way.

26:58.967 --> 27:00.867
Frankie, you were
a very shy boy.

27:00.902 --> 27:02.869
You had a hard time
making friends.

27:02.904 --> 27:05.405
you needed a little help.

27:05.440 --> 27:07.006
How is that helping?

27:07.042 --> 27:08.808
All these years, i thought those
guys were really my friends.

27:08.843 --> 27:11.544
They became your friends
once they got to know you.

27:11.579 --> 27:14.681
You just needed a chance.

27:16.117 --> 27:20.086
So you think i should tell
kent to join the cub scouts?

27:22.457 --> 27:25.325
Kent gave you
a generous offer.

27:25.360 --> 27:26.859
Go. Enjoy it.

27:26.895 --> 27:29.095
You wouldn't be saying that
if you had to go.

27:29.130 --> 27:31.164
I would, too.

or complain?

27:37.339 --> 27:38.738
Yeah.

27:43.078 --> 27:44.577
Fascinating.

27:44.612 --> 27:46.145
When i was researching
dr. Bell,

27:46.181 --> 27:48.114
I read a great deal about
autopsies from this period.

27:48.149 --> 27:51.417
But to actually hold
an autopsy book...

27:51.453 --> 27:55.989
You'd be surprised how little
protocols have changed.

27:56.024 --> 27:58.591
You know, i haven't found
anything pertaining

27:58.626 --> 28:00.960
To this murder/suicide case.
Have you?

28:03.064 --> 28:04.697
Imagine if the people
who wrote these reports

28:04.733 --> 28:08.801
Knew that we'd be studying them
over a hundred years later.

28:08.837 --> 28:10.269
What would they make

28:10.305 --> 28:12.338
Of all the advances in medicine
and treatments?

28:12.374 --> 28:13.940
That's where the imagination
of the novelist

28:13.975 --> 28:16.876
Can help fill in the gaps.

28:16.911 --> 28:19.078
Do you ever think about how
people of the future

28:19.114 --> 28:20.680
Will look at the work
you do?

28:20.715 --> 28:24.317
Samantha, what are you doing?

28:33.837 --> 28:36.238
You were right to be
suspicious about samantha.

28:36.273 --> 28:38.640
She said all those nice things
about my writing

28:38.676 --> 28:40.509
Just so i'd trust her.

28:40.544 --> 28:43.111
Oh, come on.
That can't be true.

28:43.147 --> 28:44.112
Oh. It's so obvious.

28:44.148 --> 28:45.981
I caught her trying
to remove files.

28:46.016 --> 28:48.584
She just used me to get access
to the archives.

28:48.619 --> 28:51.153
What'd she try to take?

28:52.222 --> 28:55.757
A list of the patients
that died in 1905.

28:55.793 --> 28:57.359
She wanted to research
the families

28:57.394 --> 28:59.928
And see if they knew anything
about hateful hannah.

28:59.964 --> 29:01.797
I'll have nina run
the names on the list,

29:01.832 --> 29:03.699
But that list is
over a hundred years old.

29:03.734 --> 29:06.602
I doubt it has anything
to do with our case.

29:06.637 --> 29:07.936
I just feel so foolish.

29:07.972 --> 29:11.273
I...Allowed the flattery
to cloud my reason.

29:11.308 --> 29:15.844
so you're
human like the rest of us?

29:18.148 --> 29:21.149
Well, the archives were
illuminating, though.

29:21.185 --> 29:23.885
Yeah?
According to the records,

29:23.921 --> 29:26.755
Hannah rose
died of typhoid fever.

29:26.790 --> 29:28.957
Her doctor was looking
for a cure,

29:28.993 --> 29:30.959
Trying various treatments
on several patients,

29:30.995 --> 29:33.161
But none were successful
and all the patients died.

29:33.197 --> 29:34.830
What happened
to the doctor?

29:34.865 --> 29:37.265
Well, after his patients died,
he committed suicide.

29:37.301 --> 29:38.800
Mm.

29:38.836 --> 29:41.403
But there is no mention
of a ghost or roses

29:41.438 --> 29:43.205
Anywhere in the archives.

29:43.240 --> 29:44.973
Well, the administrator
knew all about it.

29:45.009 --> 29:46.708
I mean, she told us about
a ghost story

29:46.744 --> 29:49.211
That nearly destroyed
the hospital.

29:49.246 --> 29:50.312
Well, it<i> was</i> 1905.

29:50.347 --> 29:53.215
People more readily
accepted the supernatural.

29:53.250 --> 29:55.951
And all those deaths
all at once and a suicide,

29:55.986 --> 29:58.020
It would be fertile ground
for a ghost story.

29:58.055 --> 30:00.856
I would think that a murderous
ghost haunting a hospital

30:00.891 --> 30:02.991
Would be somewhat newsworthy.
I agree.

30:03.027 --> 30:06.128
But samantha said she couldn't
find any accounts of the story.

30:06.163 --> 30:08.196
And are we going to believe her
on that one?

30:08.232 --> 30:09.564
Well, if she had found
something,

30:09.600 --> 30:10.966
She wouldn't have
come to us.

30:11.001 --> 30:14.936
Well, somehow,
the killer knows all about it

30:14.972 --> 30:16.738
Because they had to throw in
the rose

30:16.774 --> 30:18.140
To connect it
to hannah rose.

30:18.175 --> 30:19.808
Where would they find
her name?

30:19.843 --> 30:21.243
Not from
the hospital archives.

30:21.278 --> 30:24.279
Those records had been
undisturbed for many years.

30:24.314 --> 30:27.949
Well, with that many deaths
and a suicide,

30:27.985 --> 30:30.085
Somebody had to have
reported on it.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.853
if we can't find the article,

30:31.889 --> 30:33.321
Then that means somebody
stole it.

30:39.329 --> 30:42.030
No, that's two z's.

this has happened.

30:50.808 --> 30:52.674
Can't you make a note
on the file or something?

30:52.710 --> 30:54.509
No, no, no, yeah. Whatever.
I understand.

30:54.545 --> 30:55.777
Thank you for your help.

30:55.813 --> 30:57.212
everything okay?

30:57.247 --> 31:01.183
my father's having
financial problems.

31:01.218 --> 31:03.685
Somehow his creditors
keep getting my number.

31:03.721 --> 31:04.986
That's annoying.
Yeah.

31:05.022 --> 31:07.856
It's always something
with him, you know?

31:07.891 --> 31:09.558
Maybe it's just a part
of being a rizzoli.

31:09.593 --> 31:11.026
If i have a son,

31:11.061 --> 31:12.994
He's probably gonna have to
clean up my messes.

31:13.030 --> 31:15.130
Don't do that.
What?

31:15.165 --> 31:16.698
Don't put yourself down
like that.

31:16.734 --> 31:18.200
You're not like your father.
You know that, right?

31:18.235 --> 31:19.668
Yeah, i was just joking.

31:19.703 --> 31:23.839
But i'm not. I knew him.
And i know you.

31:23.874 --> 31:26.608
And i know what you've
grown into the past few years.

31:26.643 --> 31:28.210
You're a good man
and a fine detective.

31:28.245 --> 31:29.244
Thank you.

31:29.279 --> 31:31.580
So maybe it's time
to just stop.

31:31.615 --> 31:33.048
Stop what?

31:33.083 --> 31:35.283
Stop being frankie junior.
You're not a kid anymore.

31:35.319 --> 31:37.152
Well, i've always been
frankie junior.

31:37.187 --> 31:40.288
Doesn't mean you always
have to be...Frank.

31:52.402 --> 31:53.935
Hey.
Hey.

31:53.971 --> 31:55.570
Kent's looking for you
again.

31:55.606 --> 31:57.472
Well, he's a hard guy
to avoid.

31:57.508 --> 31:59.541
Then maybe you shouldn't
avoid him.

31:59.576 --> 32:00.842
I'll call him. I promise.

32:00.878 --> 32:02.711
I bet you'll have
a good time.

32:02.746 --> 32:05.080
Sure.
And maybe after the concert,

32:05.115 --> 32:07.883
You guys could sign up
for cub scouts.

32:07.918 --> 32:09.317
I'm gonna disown my mother.

32:09.353 --> 32:12.053
that won't stop her
from telling me

32:12.089 --> 32:14.589
All the cute
frankie junior stories.

32:14.625 --> 32:16.158
Did you find anything

32:16.193 --> 32:17.993
In the historical document room
at the library, scout?

32:18.028 --> 32:20.629
Actually, i did.
Oh.

32:20.664 --> 32:22.330
Turns out a lot of pages
were cut out

32:22.366 --> 32:24.933
Of the original editions
of "the dispatch" from 1905.

32:24.968 --> 32:28.370
These are the names of people
who looked at newspapers

32:28.405 --> 32:30.972
From the early 1900s
over the last two months.

32:33.544 --> 32:36.144
Any, uh, security cameras
in that area of the library?

32:36.180 --> 32:38.146
No. Apparently, they use
all their money

32:38.182 --> 32:41.149
For white cotton gloves.

32:41.185 --> 32:42.350
Hmm.

32:42.386 --> 32:44.553
This is interesting.

32:44.588 --> 32:47.856
Joseph mason.
Why is he so special?

32:47.891 --> 32:50.192
he died two years ago,

32:50.227 --> 32:53.361
But checked into the library
last month.

33:05.609 --> 33:07.709
There you are. I've been
looking for you everywhere.

33:07.744 --> 33:09.211
Oh! Wow, yeah.

33:09.246 --> 33:11.847
I've been, uh...
I was just about to call you.

33:11.882 --> 33:15.250
I'd love to come.
I would love to come, yeah.

33:15.285 --> 33:18.587
What is it? Is it bagpipes
or -- or the clear shark?

33:18.622 --> 33:20.388
Clear...

33:20.424 --> 33:23.859
Oh, you mean --
you mean clÃ rsach? God, no.

33:23.894 --> 33:25.727
You're not into harp music,
are you?

33:25.762 --> 33:30.198
No, no. I just thought that,
you know, you...

33:30.234 --> 33:32.500
yes!

33:32.536 --> 33:33.969
This is so cool.

33:34.004 --> 33:36.304
um, hey, hey, i, uh,

33:36.340 --> 33:38.673
I gotta go canvass a building
for witnesses.

33:38.709 --> 33:40.208
You got time
for a ride-along?

33:40.244 --> 33:41.643
Really?
Yeah!

33:41.678 --> 33:43.278
You sure?
Come on.

33:43.313 --> 33:45.180
Oh, that'd be grand. I just need
to get my bag from downstairs.

33:45.215 --> 33:46.915
All right.

33:46.950 --> 33:48.316
I've got an extra ticket
for tonight

33:48.352 --> 33:50.151
If you know anyone else
who wants to come along.

33:50.187 --> 33:52.587
Oh, i know just the person.

34:00.097 --> 34:02.964
Any leads on who might be using
the mason library card?

34:03.000 --> 34:04.866
Frankie talked to an old-timer
who knew mason.

34:04.902 --> 34:06.935
Remembered him as being
very frail,

34:06.970 --> 34:09.237
But he had a caregiver who lived
next door -- margery cannon.

34:09.273 --> 34:11.740
Margery died six months ago
of cancer,

34:11.775 --> 34:14.042
And her husband died
20 years before that.

34:14.077 --> 34:17.445
I'm getting really tired of all
our leads being dead people.

34:17.481 --> 34:19.047
All right.

34:19.082 --> 34:21.750
There were no margery cannon
admitted to the mallon hospital.

34:21.785 --> 34:23.585
Maybe she was
at a different hospital.

34:24.955 --> 34:26.721
She died at st. Mary's.

34:26.757 --> 34:30.759
"survived by her devoted
stepson, james miller."

34:32.362 --> 34:34.663
James miller. James...

34:34.698 --> 34:35.931
Can you pull the list
of employees

34:35.966 --> 34:37.399
At the mallon hospital,
please?

34:41.872 --> 34:44.873
Yeah. James miller.
Maintenance department.

34:44.908 --> 34:46.441
A maintenance guy could
move around the hospital

34:46.476 --> 34:48.977
And never raise an eyebrow.
Yeah, let's go talk to him.

34:49.012 --> 34:50.979
Also, uh, could you call
the hospital, please,

34:51.014 --> 34:53.648
And see if margery cannon was
in dr. Morgan's drug trials?

34:53.684 --> 34:55.450
Yeah.
Thanks.

34:55.485 --> 34:57.152
mm-hmm.

35:01.024 --> 35:04.759
Ms. Najafi is unavailable,
but she left this for you.

35:04.795 --> 35:07.996
Margery's application to
dr. Morgan's program was denied.

35:08.031 --> 35:11.199
Her form of cancer couldn't be
treated with his drugs.

35:11.234 --> 35:12.667
So james miller
came to work every day

35:12.703 --> 35:14.302
And watched people
in the program being cured

35:14.338 --> 35:16.304
While his stepmom died.

35:16.340 --> 35:18.807
So his revenge wasn't
just against the hospital,

35:18.842 --> 35:20.108
But also dr. Morgan.

35:20.143 --> 35:22.410
And jennie tate was just
collateral damage.

35:22.446 --> 35:25.547
Um, could we see james miller's
personnel file, please?

35:25.582 --> 35:26.681
I'm sorry, detective,

35:26.717 --> 35:28.016
But ms. Najafi
is the only person

35:28.051 --> 35:30.185
Who has access to those files.
She's out.

35:30.220 --> 35:31.786
out where?

35:31.822 --> 35:33.054
The construction foreman
called,

35:33.090 --> 35:34.389
Said there was
some kind of problem.

35:34.424 --> 35:36.691
There's nobody on the site
at this hour.

35:37.494 --> 35:38.693
Thank you.

35:40.163 --> 35:43.598
Stop! Aah!

35:43.633 --> 35:45.967
no, please!

35:46.003 --> 35:47.268
Aah!

35:53.735 --> 35:54.767
No, please.

35:57.171 --> 35:59.705
James, no! Don't!

35:59.741 --> 36:00.840
Don't do it.

36:00.875 --> 36:02.108
Please help me.

36:02.143 --> 36:03.576
Stay back.

36:03.611 --> 36:06.245
It is not her fault
that your stepmom is dead.

36:06.280 --> 36:07.513
Yes, it is.

36:07.548 --> 36:09.382
No, it's not.
It's not anybody's fault.

36:09.417 --> 36:12.518
They turned her away.
They could've helped her.

36:12.553 --> 36:13.853
It's all their fault.

36:13.888 --> 36:16.188
The treatment wouldn't
help her cancer.

36:16.224 --> 36:18.791
You don't know that.
James, listen to me.

36:18.826 --> 36:20.393
Margery would not have
wanted this.

36:20.428 --> 36:22.461
She helped people.
She took care of people.

36:22.497 --> 36:24.397
She would not want
somebody else to die.

36:26.934 --> 36:28.267
No! No!
Aah!

36:28.302 --> 36:29.802
I got her! I got her! Go!

36:45.186 --> 36:47.486
[ thunderclap,
electricity crackles ]

37:07.809 --> 37:08.808
She all right?

37:08.843 --> 37:10.543
She's responding to
the antitoxin.

37:10.578 --> 37:12.311
Miller never had a chance
to give her the whole syringe.

37:12.346 --> 37:13.846
It's not a ghost.

37:15.116 --> 37:17.183
Thanks.

37:20.088 --> 37:21.654
Don't think about it.

37:21.689 --> 37:23.089
Yeah.

37:23.124 --> 37:25.191
Let's go.

37:44.746 --> 37:46.378
Maura?

37:46.414 --> 37:47.613
Hello.

37:47.648 --> 37:50.416
I'm so glad you still came
to the conference.

37:52.487 --> 37:57.223
What i did was...
Unforgivable.

37:57.258 --> 37:59.225
Well,
i'm not going to lie.

37:59.260 --> 38:02.094
For a person of your ability
to do such a thing,

38:02.130 --> 38:04.864
It was surprising
and disappointing.

38:04.899 --> 38:08.868
The blank page can make you
a little crazy sometimes.

38:08.903 --> 38:11.370
But i should not have violated
your trust,

38:11.405 --> 38:14.340
And for that,
i am deeply ashamed.

38:14.375 --> 38:17.810
Will you allow me
to make it up to you?

38:17.845 --> 38:19.979
May i introduce you
to some people?

38:20.014 --> 38:22.148
That's not necessary.

38:22.183 --> 38:24.383
No, no. I-i want to.

38:24.418 --> 38:26.685
I meant what i said.
You're a wonderful writer.

38:26.721 --> 38:29.088
And these people might be able
to help you.

38:30.892 --> 38:32.258
Please?

38:34.896 --> 38:36.896
Okay.

38:36.931 --> 38:38.364
Where's detective rizzoli?

38:38.399 --> 38:40.766
I thought she was coming here
with you tonight.

38:40.802 --> 38:43.002
Yeah, she's just running
a few minutes late.

38:43.037 --> 38:44.470
She had to shoot someone.

38:44.505 --> 38:47.439
Hi.
oh! [ chuckles ]

38:47.475 --> 38:50.476
I only shoot people
in the line of duty.

38:50.511 --> 38:52.545
Mostly.

38:52.580 --> 38:54.613
Um, we're fine.

38:54.649 --> 38:55.915
Mm-hmm.

38:55.950 --> 38:57.716
Samantha, in fact, has kindly
offered to introduce us

38:57.752 --> 39:00.019
To some of the wonderful
writers here.

39:00.054 --> 39:02.354
Wow. How kind.
Jane.

39:02.390 --> 39:05.291
What?
Point taken.

39:06.661 --> 39:10.229
Tess! Tess.
Come and meet my friends.

39:12.400 --> 39:14.099
This is tess.
Hi.

39:14.135 --> 39:15.801
Hi.
Jane rizzoli.

39:15.837 --> 39:18.337
Ah.
She's a detective with
the boston police department.

39:18.372 --> 39:21.340
Oh. And is that dress
official police issue?

39:21.375 --> 39:23.676
uh, yes.

39:23.711 --> 39:25.945
Actually, you should see when
my brother wears it.

39:25.980 --> 39:26.946
It's even more fabulous.

39:28.983 --> 39:30.249
And this is dr. Maura isles.

39:30.284 --> 39:32.117
She's
the chief medical examiner.

39:32.153 --> 39:33.519
It is a pleasure to meet you.

39:33.554 --> 39:34.954
Oh, you two are gonna be
the most popular people

39:34.989 --> 39:36.522
In the room tonight.

39:36.557 --> 39:38.858
You know, no one loves hearing
about murder and mayhem

39:38.893 --> 39:41.227
More than mystery writers.

39:41.262 --> 39:44.897
Absolutely. Shall we? Yes?
Yes.

39:47.702 --> 39:49.335
Such a pleasure
to meet you.

39:49.370 --> 39:51.303
Well, i wanna...

39:54.542 --> 39:56.775
Find me every seven minutes.

40:06.554 --> 40:08.654
Ooh. This looks promising.

40:08.689 --> 40:11.991
It's a one-week writer's retreat
in the adirondacks.

40:12.026 --> 40:14.894
And all vegan, no tv,
no internet.

40:14.929 --> 40:16.862
No, thank you.

40:16.898 --> 40:18.097
We should both do it.

40:18.132 --> 40:20.132
Do you really hate me
that much?

40:20.167 --> 40:21.667
You should write a book, too.

40:21.702 --> 40:23.802
Maura, that might be
the worst idea you've ever had.

40:23.838 --> 40:25.938
Why? You have so many
great stories.
Great.

40:25.973 --> 40:28.540
Then you tell them, and i'll
wait for the books on tape.

40:28.576 --> 40:31.143
well,
thanks for coming, anyway.

40:31.178 --> 40:33.112
Yes, the refreshments
were refreshing.

40:33.147 --> 40:35.581
Frankie told me to meet him here
after the concert.

40:35.616 --> 40:38.517
Oh. Uh, well, they are not...

40:38.552 --> 40:40.286
Oh, my god.
...Here.

40:40.321 --> 40:41.887
that was amazing!

40:41.923 --> 40:44.723
I mean, the -- the pyro
and the -- the makeup, right?

40:44.759 --> 40:47.226
Oh, my god. We had so much fun.

40:47.261 --> 40:48.527
Friends of yours?

40:48.562 --> 40:51.397
Uh, yeah.
We made lots of friends.

40:51.432 --> 40:52.765
Where's kent?

40:52.800 --> 40:55.401
Ah! We're gonna rock
this place all night!

40:55.436 --> 40:57.970
Whoo, yeah!
Drinks are on me, guys!

40:58.005 --> 40:59.338
Whoo!

40:59.373 --> 41:00.973
It's better
than the kilt.

41:01.008 --> 41:03.609
Guys, what a gig!

41:03.644 --> 41:05.344
We were there,
right up the front.

41:05.379 --> 41:06.612
He was looking at me. Aah!

41:06.647 --> 41:08.047
And i was like, "aah!"

41:08.082 --> 41:09.481
Right? Right, and then --

41:09.517 --> 41:11.283
Ohh!

41:11.319 --> 41:13.619
It was so cool!
Whiskeys all around, all around,
everybody here.

41:13.654 --> 41:14.954
Whoo!

41:14.989 --> 41:16.555
Yes!
