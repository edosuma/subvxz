00:10.933 --> 00:13.566
You were havin' breakfast
with your pals the other day.

00:17.466 --> 00:19.366
Fuck were youse
drunk last night.

00:19.400 --> 00:21.366
You know, I can't stand it
when you guys get really,

00:21.400 --> 00:22.866
really, really drunk.

00:22.900 --> 00:25.066
‐Wasn't s'bad.
‐It was s'goddamn bad.

00:25.100 --> 00:26.433
You get super annoying

00:26.466 --> 00:28.100
when you're really,
really, really drunk.

00:28.133 --> 00:29.500
Right, scary Dary?

00:29.533 --> 00:31.166
Please leave me alone.

00:31.200 --> 00:33.333
Pushing your nipples
against everyone all night?

00:33.366 --> 00:35.100
And what about you,
madman Dan?

00:35.133 --> 00:37.100
Or should I say,
Legend of the Wind?

00:37.133 --> 00:38.500
It's Squirrelly Dan,
Miss Katy.

00:38.533 --> 00:40.133
Challenging everyone
to a foot race?

00:40.166 --> 00:41.433
Get real.

00:41.466 --> 00:43.600
Please stop shouting
at me, Miss Katy.

00:43.633 --> 00:45.366
And let's not skim
over Wayne the Pain.

00:45.400 --> 00:46.900
WAYNE: Mind your
own beeswax, Katy.

00:46.933 --> 00:49.200
You have the most
annoying fuckin' laugh

00:49.233 --> 00:50.566
on planet fuckin' Earth,

00:50.600 --> 00:52.366
when you get really,
really, really, drunk.

00:53.100 --> 00:54.366
Clean it up!

00:58.466 --> 01:00.933
There's a new addition to
the Squirrelly Dan fam‐damly.

01:00.966 --> 01:02.166
I've seen that
in the paper.

01:02.200 --> 01:03.266
What's the scoop there,
big shooter?

01:03.300 --> 01:04.900
Well, Samuel's...

01:04.933 --> 01:06.066
‐I fuckin' hate Samuel.
‐He's a Big Brother's now.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.466
Oh, I fuckin' hate
Samuel so much.

01:07.500 --> 01:09.100
Well, that's interesting,
maybe make Samuel

01:09.133 --> 01:10.400
straighten up,
fly right there.

01:10.433 --> 01:11.600
That's what I said.

01:11.633 --> 01:12.833
Youse did pot today,
didn't ya's.

01:12.866 --> 01:14.166
No.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.266
'Cause youse are talkin'
like youse did pot.

01:15.300 --> 01:16.933
‐Why?
‐Because that logic

01:16.966 --> 01:19.433
is Titanic on the
ocean floor busted.

01:19.466 --> 01:20.966
Why?

01:21.000 --> 01:22.166
Well, it's like when
a celebrity gets all

01:22.200 --> 01:23.933
fucked up on snooters
and such.

01:23.966 --> 01:25.333
They think that the solution
to sortin' themselves out

01:25.366 --> 01:27.433
is to get a puppy.

01:27.466 --> 01:29.266
(CHUCKLES) What's wrong
with a puppy?

01:29.300 --> 01:31.000
Well, I'm just sayin', doesn't
it seem more appropriate

01:31.033 --> 01:33.166
to sort yourself out before
bringing a beating heart

01:33.200 --> 01:35.133
into your own home,
rather than relying on

01:35.166 --> 01:36.833
that beating heart
to sort yourself out?

01:36.866 --> 01:38.200
Snooters and such.

01:38.233 --> 01:39.566
Uh, hmm, I had my go
with snooters and such.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.400
Small town spawn
snooters and such.

01:41.433 --> 01:43.166
KATY: Degens do
snooters and such.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.066
‐Over and out.
‐I'd have to agree.

01:45.100 --> 01:46.866
I think it's differents
for Samuel's,

01:46.900 --> 01:49.033
he's just a six‐years‐old
with a penchants for mischief.

01:49.066 --> 01:50.866
Someone needs to hit that kid.

01:50.900 --> 01:52.933
I thinks for a six‐years‐old
introducing a little brother's

01:52.966 --> 01:55.066
into the mix might just be
what he needs to inspires him

01:55.100 --> 01:56.266
to sort's himself out.

01:56.300 --> 01:57.966
I have to agree.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.400
It's like Samuel who's
introducing a little brother

01:59.433 --> 02:00.900
to himself to sort
himself out.

02:00.933 --> 02:02.566
It's different than
like a celebrity

02:02.600 --> 02:04.166
introducing a puppy

02:04.200 --> 02:06.300
to sort himself out
after snooters and such.

02:06.333 --> 02:08.266
And my cousin says
the baby is very smart.

02:08.300 --> 02:10.266
‐Pump the brakes?
‐I'll soft pump.

02:10.300 --> 02:12.933
What's the stupidest thing
you ever heard in your life?

02:12.966 --> 02:14.466
I would like to say, but
it's impolite to talk politics

02:14.500 --> 02:16.266
at the breakfast table.

02:16.300 --> 02:17.966
I'd also likes to say but it's
impolite to talk religions

02:18.000 --> 02:19.566
at the breakfast table.

02:19.600 --> 02:21.533
Well, mine is neither politics
or religion so I will say,

02:21.566 --> 02:23.866
the stupidest thing
I ever heard in my life,

02:23.900 --> 02:26.600
is that a baby is smart.

02:26.633 --> 02:28.866
Well, hold your horses
there, big shoots.

02:28.900 --> 02:30.233
My Aunt Nancy works
at the nursery down

02:30.266 --> 02:31.533
at the hospitals and she says

02:31.566 --> 02:33.200
I was the smartest baby
she ever did see.

02:33.233 --> 02:34.366
Your Aunt Nancy said that

02:34.400 --> 02:35.433
I was destined
for constant confusion.

02:35.466 --> 02:37.000
Are you saying my Aunt Nancy

02:37.033 --> 02:38.933
is stupids for saying
such things?

02:38.966 --> 02:40.933
I love your Aunt Nancy.

02:40.966 --> 02:42.100
I owe her a great deal for

02:42.133 --> 02:43.366
my personal growth
as a young man.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.033
I even call her my Aunt Nancy.

02:45.066 --> 02:46.266
Please tell her I said hello.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.466
I will, good friend.

02:48.500 --> 02:51.066
But what, see‐suckin',
so to speak,

02:51.100 --> 02:53.366
makes a baby smart?

02:53.400 --> 02:54.900
Well, she says I was always

02:54.933 --> 02:56.166
reachin' out for things
in my surroundings.

02:56.200 --> 02:57.266
And that made you
a smart baby?

02:57.300 --> 02:58.333
‐Allegedly's.
‐Okay, Dan.

02:58.366 --> 02:59.900
Okay, okay, Dan.

02:59.933 --> 03:01.266
Okay, hold your thumb out.

03:01.300 --> 03:02.400
I'm gonna be a baby.

03:08.100 --> 03:10.500
Ehya.

03:10.533 --> 03:12.100
Now what about that suggests
I ought to be buildin'

03:12.133 --> 03:14.066
rocket ships for NASA
in outer space?

03:14.100 --> 03:15.333
Your Aunt Nancy said that

03:15.366 --> 03:16.333
a baby who shows
signs of excitement

03:16.366 --> 03:17.833
before it's able to verbally

03:17.866 --> 03:19.966
communicate is a sign
of intelligence.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.866
KATY: Aunt Nancy said
signs of stimulation.

03:22.900 --> 03:24.866
Well, 'cause that means that
they're already getting

03:24.900 --> 03:26.333
excited about
their surroundings.

03:26.366 --> 03:28.600
KATY: A baby is stimulated
by their surroundings.

03:28.633 --> 03:30.100
Okay, Dary, okay.

03:30.133 --> 03:31.533
Okay, Dary, yeah, okay.

03:31.566 --> 03:32.933
Go wide‐eyed stick
your tongue out.

03:32.966 --> 03:34.566
I'm gonna be a baby, okay?

03:34.600 --> 03:35.933
I'm gonna show you signs of
excitement slash stimulation.

03:38.333 --> 03:39.933
No but, Dary, like...

03:39.966 --> 03:41.200

you're doing it to a baby.

03:53.866 --> 03:54.900

03:56.066 --> 03:57.600
Now what about that suggests

03:57.633 --> 03:58.933
that I ought to be navigating
unchartered neurological

03:58.966 --> 04:00.166
pathways in the brain?

04:00.200 --> 04:01.200
I expose nothin'.

04:01.233 --> 04:03.033
Yeah, realistically.

04:03.066 --> 04:05.066
Furthermore, in the midst of
excitement slash stimulation,

04:05.100 --> 04:06.466
that razor sharp
baby is likely

04:06.500 --> 04:08.166
to drop a shit in its pants.

04:08.200 --> 04:09.933
Unable to control its
own bodily functions

04:09.966 --> 04:11.900

04:11.933 --> 04:13.533
Imaginable's, but I wouldn't
say likely's.

04:13.566 --> 04:15.066
Hmm, it's possible.

04:15.100 --> 04:16.500
Okay, Dan, okay.

04:16.533 --> 04:19.233
Okay, Dary, Dary, okay.
Dan, hold your thumb out.

04:19.266 --> 04:21.166
Dary, go wide‐eyed,
stick your tongue out,

04:21.200 --> 04:22.433
and coo like you're
doing it to a baby.

05:17.233 --> 05:19.066
Had a rowdy crowd
in last night, boys.

05:19.100 --> 05:20.466
Where the fuck from?

05:20.500 --> 05:21.600

to say they were gay degens.

Well, we'll just let you runs
with that there, Gailer.

05:33.366 --> 05:36.200
Look, we've all had a run‐in
with degens from up country.

But we figured out a solution.

05:37.633 --> 05:39.233
All you have to do

05:39.266 --> 05:42.500
is employ the Ginger and
Boots to be your bouncers.

Degens won't wanna
a whiff of this place.

05:44.100 --> 05:45.366
Choice idea, Daryl.

Also go ahead and change
the name of my bar

to say I love him, too.

like, being touched

or anything like that,
but then like,

06:16.233 --> 06:18.266
he'll be huggin' you

"God bless you."

really a religious guy's,

you feel good, like...

06:29.133 --> 06:30.333
Like I can feel the warmth.

about the low‐bones.

Oh, youse can's never forget's
about the low‐bones.

I hope this is
what I think it is.

06:43.966 --> 06:45.600
What's low‐bones?

06:45.633 --> 06:48.066
Well, low‐bones is basically

06:48.100 --> 06:49.466
like if somebody's
saying something,

06:49.500 --> 06:51.000
and you agree with them,

06:51.033 --> 06:52.566
that means give
them low‐bones.

06:52.600 --> 06:54.900
You can also use low‐bones
to say hellos or good‐byes.

06:54.933 --> 06:56.400
Do you wanna know what?
Here's what low‐bones is,

06:56.433 --> 06:58.200
I can tell you
what low‐bones is.

06:58.233 --> 06:59.500
Low‐bones is when you hold
your knuckles below your waist

06:59.533 --> 07:01.333
like this and bang knuckles
with somebody.

07:01.366 --> 07:02.900
Except don't look the person
in the eye or in the knuckles

07:02.933 --> 07:04.066
when you bang knuckles
with them.

07:04.100 --> 07:05.600
Almost like you
don't give a care.

07:05.633 --> 07:06.833
And then you say somethin'
positive under your breath

07:06.866 --> 07:08.033
upon bangin' of the knuckles.

07:08.066 --> 07:10.233
Like, uh,
"Hell yeah, fuck it."

07:11.300 --> 07:12.333
Or, uh...

07:12.366 --> 07:13.866
"Yeah, man, you rock."

here and I'm gonna show you

say it more under

all‐male teammates in hopes

10:19.233 --> 10:21.033
that they will accept me.

10:21.066 --> 10:23.366
And then having my penis
called "modest,"

10:23.400 --> 10:25.900
with my all‐male team further
coming together as a result

10:25.933 --> 10:28.266

honest opinions,

10:44.100 --> 10:45.566
which I do appreciate,

10:45.600 --> 10:48.000
you could have called
my penis "the big picture."
