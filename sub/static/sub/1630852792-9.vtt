WEBVTT

00:32.160 --> 00:35.000
[dramatic music]

00:52.920 --> 00:54.400
[rapid gunfire]

01:08.760 --> 01:10.160
Cut that one down!

01:11.800 --> 01:14.160
[energy crackling]

01:18.600 --> 01:19.800
Kreld!

01:21.400 --> 01:24.160
Hear the laughter of the gods!

01:25.360 --> 01:27.160
[laughing maniacally]

01:30.200 --> 01:33.840
[tense action music]

01:41.440 --> 01:43.440
[distant gunfire and explosions]

01:48.440 --> 01:49.960
[groaning]

01:50.960 --> 01:52.640
[straining]

01:54.400 --> 01:55.680
[shouts]

01:55.760 --> 01:58.120
Your tricks shall not save you.

01:58.360 --> 01:59.360
[grunts]

01:59.440 --> 02:00.840
[groans]

02:04.040 --> 02:08.680
[heavy footsteps approaching]

02:13.400 --> 02:16.160
This tomb of a world is ours.

02:16.240 --> 02:19.320
Your resurrection machines are ruins.

02:20.080 --> 02:21.720
You end here.

02:21.800 --> 02:23.880
I offer an exchange.

02:24.680 --> 02:28.480
What could a creature like you offer us?

02:28.560 --> 02:32.080
Power, glory, conquest.

02:32.480 --> 02:36.320
The empty promise of a doomed xenos.

02:37.800 --> 02:38.920
[groaning]

02:39.000 --> 02:40.280
Reality.

02:40.760 --> 02:43.680
In an agglomeration of dead ships,

02:43.760 --> 02:50.360
far from here there is an artefact
made by our ancient enemies, the Aeldari.

02:51.440 --> 02:53.960
It let them tunnel beneath reality

02:54.520 --> 02:59.360
and create their paths
between the stars, their webway.

02:59.920 --> 03:03.720
This artefact
would allow you to do the same.

03:03.800 --> 03:07.120
We have never been able to unlock
the mysteries of the webway.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.720
If we did...

03:08.800 --> 03:12.280
Armies could be marched
across the galaxy at will...

03:13.200 --> 03:15.840
It will be yours if you wish.

03:16.520 --> 03:18.880
We wish only for your annihilation.

03:19.720 --> 03:23.360
Let him speak.

03:26.080 --> 03:29.000
[ominous music]

03:29.440 --> 03:32.240
[heavy footsteps approaching]

03:42.160 --> 03:45.600
[suspenseful music]

03:49.720 --> 03:52.040
[thunder rumbles]

03:53.400 --> 03:55.480
The treasure is here...

03:55.680 --> 03:59.760
In what your kind call the Crucian Depths.

04:05.080 --> 04:11.120
You will go and find
if this artefact exists,

04:11.680 --> 04:16.200
and if it does, you will bring it to me.

04:16.840 --> 04:20.240
By your will, my Warmaster.

04:21.840 --> 04:28.400
[Abaddon] And in exchange for this gift,
you will have the only mercy you deserve.

04:45.960 --> 04:49.560
[low rumbling]

04:50.000 --> 04:52.480
[engine sounds]

04:52.920 --> 04:54.360
Augurs to maximum.

04:54.440 --> 04:58.600
Find the artefact location
and lock teleport coordinates.

04:59.720 --> 05:01.920
Lord, we see...

05:02.720 --> 05:05.080
our eyes see.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.400
The topography matches the data
given by the Necron-entity.

05:12.920 --> 05:17.600
[Augur Slave]
Teleportation close to the artefact

05:17.680 --> 05:20.440
is not possible.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.560
[Witch Slave rasping]

05:30.640 --> 05:34.160
There are clouds in the sacred waters...

05:34.520 --> 05:38.320
shadows, absences.

05:39.200 --> 05:43.200
The place you seek is a black space,

05:43.640 --> 05:47.120
the hands of the gods
cannot place you within,

05:47.720 --> 05:52.600
and once inside,
they will not be able to aid you.

05:53.640 --> 05:54.720
[bitter chuckling]

05:55.440 --> 05:58.800
This does not bode well.

05:59.160 --> 06:00.320
What is that?

06:00.640 --> 06:02.640
[Hesiod] Enhance and identify.

06:03.320 --> 06:05.520
[beeping]

06:07.560 --> 06:10.200
[scoffs] Drukhari raiders.

06:10.280 --> 06:12.480
Are their ships active?

06:12.880 --> 06:15.720
[Augur Slave]
The xenos craft are inactive.

06:16.320 --> 06:20.280
Life signs and energy signatures
read as negative.

06:20.960 --> 06:24.400
The Drukhari have the means
to make truth seem false.

06:24.480 --> 06:28.520
Veils of shadow and lies
cast over our eyes.

06:29.280 --> 06:31.560
Those ships could be
powering up right now,

06:31.680 --> 06:33.840
and we wouldn't know it before they stung.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.320
I've seen it done.

06:37.160 --> 06:42.360
My masters, the Drukhari raiding craft
are marked by micro damage

06:42.440 --> 06:44.160
from long term immobility.

06:46.560 --> 06:49.480
[Kreld] Meaning that they have
been there for some time.

06:51.520 --> 06:52.880
I don't like it.

06:53.640 --> 06:57.840
Dead ships on the side of a mass
of dead ships?

06:58.040 --> 07:01.600
I can think of no better place
for them to be.

07:01.960 --> 07:03.880
They are not part of the mass.

07:04.560 --> 07:05.880
They are docked.

07:06.080 --> 07:08.000
Are you afraid now, brother?

07:08.320 --> 07:10.600
Should we turn and run?

07:10.680 --> 07:14.800
I have slain more Drukhari
than you have ever glimpsed,

07:14.880 --> 07:18.080
and left their corpses for carrion eaters.

07:18.320 --> 07:20.400
Do you wish to join them?

07:20.480 --> 07:21.880
[Hesiod] Enough!

07:22.440 --> 07:28.760
We are brothers of the Black Legion,
oathed to our Warmaster's will.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.800
Nothing else matters.

07:31.880 --> 07:33.920
As you say, brother.

07:34.520 --> 07:39.600
Suspicion has kept us alive many times,
but boldness has brought us victory.

07:40.440 --> 07:43.640
The Warmaster has commanded,
and if we fail,

07:43.720 --> 07:46.240
then it would be better
that we find death.

07:47.080 --> 07:48.600
There is no choice.

07:48.880 --> 07:49.960
We go.

07:52.360 --> 07:54.680
[crackle of energy]

07:54.920 --> 07:56.920
[whirring]

07:58.320 --> 07:59.360
[auspex beeping]

07:59.440 --> 08:01.320
[Hesiod] The artefact lies ahead.

08:01.760 --> 08:02.880
Advance.

08:05.560 --> 08:09.040
[heavy footsteps]

08:10.200 --> 08:14.320
[auspex beeping]

08:23.080 --> 08:24.920
[auspex beeping rapidly]

08:25.000 --> 08:26.200
Targets front!

08:27.960 --> 08:29.160
[shots spanging]

08:40.960 --> 08:42.160
[shouting]

08:44.120 --> 08:45.240
[groans]

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Do you wish my mercy?

08:53.080 --> 08:58.800
You will not reach what you seek,
lie-slaved warrior.

09:00.160 --> 09:03.640
There is no way out...

09:03.720 --> 09:05.440
[screams]

09:07.400 --> 09:10.000
[auspex beeping]

09:10.080 --> 09:11.280
Keep moving.

09:11.600 --> 09:14.160
The xenos are between us and the artefact.

09:14.640 --> 09:17.240
Their ship has been dead and inactive
for an age,

09:17.560 --> 09:19.320
and they're still alive?

09:19.400 --> 09:22.680
[chuckles] These ones are dead now...

09:25.280 --> 09:26.280
[loud ping]

09:40.240 --> 09:42.120
There!

09:49.600 --> 09:51.360
[ominous music]

10:01.160 --> 10:02.240
Vanished.

10:02.320 --> 10:06.880
First Drukari that should be long dead,
and then Necron phantoms.

10:07.480 --> 10:10.760
Do you still think all is as it should be?

10:11.720 --> 10:12.880
Stay alert.

10:13.840 --> 10:17.600
[heavy footsteps]

10:34.880 --> 10:35.880
[Kreld grunts]

10:35.960 --> 10:38.560
Where is the power
for the lights coming from?

10:39.320 --> 10:41.920
A power reservoir left active?

10:42.640 --> 10:44.840
With enough power to be still running now?

10:45.280 --> 10:47.440
This wreck is millennia old.

10:47.520 --> 10:52.440
A lifetime of war in the Eye of Terror,
witnessing the powers of daemons

10:52.520 --> 10:57.680
and the miracles of Dark Gods
and this seems a mystery to you?

10:58.480 --> 10:59.480
[loud ping]

11:04.280 --> 11:08.400
[suspenseful music]

11:19.160 --> 11:21.280
[grunts] What is this sorcery?

11:28.680 --> 11:29.920
[gasps]

11:31.200 --> 11:33.160
Kreld, forward.

11:33.240 --> 11:34.680
My pleasure!

11:35.760 --> 11:39.120
[suspenseful music]

11:47.960 --> 11:50.200
[shrieks]

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
[ominous music]

12:14.200 --> 12:17.200
[heavy footsteps]

12:18.800 --> 12:21.640
[snickers] It is ours...

12:22.560 --> 12:25.960
These are bolter and power weapon kills...

12:29.840 --> 12:31.080
[Kreld] Wait!

12:40.400 --> 12:45.680
[discordant music]

12:53.320 --> 12:56.160
[strobing music]

12:56.240 --> 12:57.560
[click]

13:00.160 --> 13:01.320
[click]

13:03.120 --> 13:04.640
[click]

13:11.920 --> 13:14.400
[click]

13:18.560 --> 13:21.680
[click]

13:25.080 --> 13:26.080
[click]

13:34.080 --> 13:37.720
You came very close this time.

13:40.160 --> 13:41.360
-[click]
-[gun cocks]

13:49.760 --> 13:56.040
When the Necrontyr shed flesh
and left death for lesser creatures,

13:56.400 --> 13:59.440
we thought only of freedom from fear,

13:59.800 --> 14:03.800
and making kingdoms that would never die.

14:03.880 --> 14:07.720
We did not think of what else
immortality would entail.

14:08.320 --> 14:12.360
We thought in terms of wars,
of destruction,

14:12.440 --> 14:13.840
of conquest,

14:14.360 --> 14:21.000
but eternity also requires
what you would call entertainment.

14:21.480 --> 14:22.720
[Trazyn] For my part,

14:22.800 --> 14:26.880
I find infinity allows me to observe
the myriad ways

14:26.960 --> 14:30.280
in which matter
and consciousness manifest.

14:31.080 --> 14:36.680
I collect them:
objects, life forms, moments.

14:36.760 --> 14:38.960
This is one of my favourites,

14:39.440 --> 14:43.280
a device that can create roads
under the skin of reality.

14:43.720 --> 14:46.000
Worth risking anything for,

14:46.080 --> 14:49.400
but nothing
compared to what it has brought me.

14:49.920 --> 14:52.640
This moment is locked
in a tesseract labyrinth,

14:52.720 --> 14:56.040
a pocket of space where events
play out again and again.

14:56.200 --> 14:59.600
Sometimes you reach this moment first,
sometimes others do.

14:59.840 --> 15:04.120
Each instance is different
in countless, beautiful details.

15:05.400 --> 15:06.440
[grunts]

15:07.640 --> 15:09.960
[Hesiod] You will free us!

15:10.080 --> 15:13.840
[Trazyn laughs] You can free yourselves.

15:13.960 --> 15:17.360
All you need to do to leave
the labyrinth is never enter.

15:17.640 --> 15:20.120
You are given that choice each time.

15:20.200 --> 15:25.960
I am not your jailer,
my wonderful relic of mortal pride.

15:26.040 --> 15:28.440
You are your own prisoners.

15:28.520 --> 15:31.440
The look on your faces
is my favourite part,

15:31.520 --> 15:34.760
and I have enjoyed it
a thousand times already.

15:35.880 --> 15:37.480
[Hesiod] No!

15:40.160 --> 15:42.280
I don't like anything of this.

15:42.360 --> 15:44.280
Then what? Turn back?

15:44.360 --> 15:45.360
No.

15:45.440 --> 15:52.040
Suspicion has kept us alive many times,
but boldness has brought us victory.

15:55.520 --> 15:58.400
[crackle of energy]

15:59.280 --> 16:01.080
[Hesiod] The artefact lies ahead.

16:01.800 --> 16:02.880
Advance.

16:04.200 --> 16:09.320
[heavy footsteps marching]

16:11.640 --> 16:13.480
[tense ominous music]

16:13.560 --> 16:15.320
[chuckling]

16:15.400 --> 16:17.400
Perfection.

16:27.240 --> 16:31.400
[tense ominous music continues]

16:33.200 --> 16:39.160
[footsteps]
