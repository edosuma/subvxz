WEBVTT

00:07.674 --> 00:10.551
Olivier called Paul in hours ago
and he's not picking up.

00:10.885 --> 00:12.594
Well, that isn't out of the ordinary, is it?

00:14.597 --> 00:15.764
How should I know?

00:16.599 --> 00:18.600
There's nothing normal
about any of this, is there?

00:18.727 --> 00:21.311
Sarah, this is the new normal, okay?

00:21.813 --> 00:25.232
So, Paul's a monitor.
He reports to Olivier, his handler, right?

00:25.275 --> 00:28.694
As long as Paul is on our side,
we can start to finally get some answers.

00:29.112 --> 00:30.946
That's my point, Cosima.

00:31.197 --> 00:32.948
What if he's not on our side?

00:32.991 --> 00:34.950
I mean, what if he's selling us out right now?

00:38.371 --> 00:41.331
Let's go back eight months,
before Beth's shooting.

00:41.750 --> 00:42.833
We already did, Olivier.

00:42.959 --> 00:46.045
When you first stated,
"She doesn't seem to be herself."

00:46.129 --> 00:49.381
Yeah, she began abusing prescription drugs.

00:50.967 --> 00:51.967
Why are you taping this?

00:52.135 --> 00:56.638
At the time, you felt it was a typical response
to the stresses of police work.

00:57.015 --> 00:59.391
- Do you view it any differently, in hindsight?
- No.

00:59.517 --> 01:01.769
Her decline led directly
to her civilian shooting.

01:01.811 --> 01:03.103
She only got worse from there.

01:03.271 --> 01:05.898
This, through your lens as a former soldier.

01:06.816 --> 01:09.151
If you told me what this was about,
perhaps I could help you.

01:09.277 --> 01:11.153
Perhaps you are helping me.

01:13.531 --> 01:17.326
Don't do it, Cosima.
Stay away from Delphine, yeah?

01:17.410 --> 01:21.330
Uh, well, if we're going to get past
our monitors, we have to engage.

01:21.456 --> 01:23.624
- Yeah, look where that got me.
- Into bed with him?

01:24.125 --> 01:26.543
Okay, look where it got Alison, yeah?

01:26.628 --> 01:30.380
She smoked her husband with a golf club
on a hunch that he was her monitor

01:30.507 --> 01:33.258
and now, they're away at a couple's retreat,
trying to repair their marriage.

01:33.343 --> 01:37.012
Okay, I'll obviously approach Delphine
way more logically than that.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.138
No, you won't.

01:38.181 --> 01:40.390
Sarah, my situation is way
different than yours is.

01:40.558 --> 01:42.851
Right, 'cause you're such a brilliant scientist.

01:43.019 --> 01:45.020
No, because she doesn't know that I know.

01:45.897 --> 01:47.356
I'm the one who's monitoring her.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.399
Can you please just stay away from her

01:49.484 --> 01:51.527
until I find out if Paul's
selling us down the river?

01:52.070 --> 01:54.113
Whatever.

01:54.572 --> 01:56.573
Got anything else we need
to be paranoid about?

01:58.159 --> 01:59.409
God, I hope not.

02:19.889 --> 02:21.056
Tomas?

02:24.769 --> 02:26.228
Where am I?

02:26.437 --> 02:28.397
You're getting stronger.

03:19.115 --> 03:22.201
Olivier told Paul to meet him
at an underground club he owns.

03:23.119 --> 03:24.703
That's Paul's car, so...

03:25.872 --> 03:26.955
What a mess.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.916
You know, even if he's not
ratting me out in there,

03:28.958 --> 03:31.460
those medical tests could
still tell him I'm not Beth.

03:31.544 --> 03:34.796
- Cosima said they wouldn't.
- Yeah, well, she's blinded by science.

03:35.673 --> 03:39.760
Maybe, but, from everything I found online,
she's right.

03:40.970 --> 03:42.596
You and Beth are clones,

03:42.805 --> 03:45.265
so you and Beth have identical DNA.

03:45.558 --> 03:47.351
- Identical?
- Yep.

03:47.769 --> 03:50.979
The DNA samples from the Jane Doe
in the gravel crusher

03:51.981 --> 03:54.650
and the killer in the bathroom,

03:54.984 --> 03:57.277
- a match, same person.

03:57.487 --> 03:58.528
That doesn't make any sense.

03:58.696 --> 04:01.907
Someone in the lab must've messed up,
contaminated or mislabeled the samples.

04:02.033 --> 04:03.992
- Not on my watch.
- Then what, Janis?

04:05.328 --> 04:07.746
I took Jane Doe DNA from a femur.

04:08.164 --> 04:11.500
Our suspect killer's DNA came
from blood we found in the bathroom.

04:12.001 --> 04:14.336
Maybe the killer planted
Jane Doe's blood there.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.672
What, so she carries around
a couple of pints of Jane Doe's blood

04:16.714 --> 04:17.714
and just splashes it around?

04:17.798 --> 04:19.257
Well, that's more likely than,
she walked into my lab

04:19.341 --> 04:20.341
and tampered with the samples.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.094
Maybe someone with access tampered.

04:23.554 --> 04:25.847
Are you trying to turn my ulcer
into a heart attack?

04:26.766 --> 04:30.352
No, we're missing something,
from the very beginning, on this thing.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.020
Yeah, lDs.

04:32.814 --> 04:35.732
So, if the high tech's broken,
we do it the horse-and-carriage way.

04:36.317 --> 04:37.442
Start from the beginning,

04:38.194 --> 04:40.028
comb through that whole shit pile again.

04:40.446 --> 04:43.657
Oh, where's that damn Jane Doe
facial reconstruction?

04:43.783 --> 04:46.618
It's coming. The face went
through a friggin' gravel crusher.

04:48.538 --> 04:49.663
"Someone with access"?

04:51.374 --> 04:53.041
Beth would never tamper with evidence.

04:53.084 --> 04:54.918
Okay, maybe not,

04:55.003 --> 04:58.088
but you had questions about
her run-in with the killer, didn't you?

05:00.258 --> 05:02.009
Square one, like the man said.

05:02.719 --> 05:03.844
Open minds.

05:04.470 --> 05:05.887
We'll see what we find.

05:08.891 --> 05:09.891
Eh, hang on.

05:13.730 --> 05:16.189
Oh. Cyber-goths.

05:16.232 --> 05:18.191
That's interesting. I know those people.

05:18.276 --> 05:21.278
Enough waiting.
I need to know what Paul's up to. I'm going in.

05:21.404 --> 05:23.905
What? No! No!

05:24.449 --> 05:27.242
You can't go in there,
with your recognizable mug.

05:28.453 --> 05:29.578
Besides...

05:31.247 --> 05:32.289
Clubland is my world.

05:33.541 --> 05:36.043
You carry that around with you everywhere?

05:36.294 --> 05:37.294
Maybe.

05:44.927 --> 05:46.386
Well, hello.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.889
Neolution's a private club.

05:48.931 --> 05:51.933
I know, but you look so lonely.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.103
Not even a little.

05:56.272 --> 05:58.774
Oh, good. You look a little more important.

05:58.900 --> 05:59.983
I...

06:01.277 --> 06:04.780
I've come all the way from Brixton
to party at Neolution before I die.

06:04.906 --> 06:06.656
My friends told me to mention Olivier.

06:10.119 --> 06:13.497
You're dying?
Then you're not familiar with Neolutionism?

06:13.790 --> 06:16.124
Oh, there's an ism.

06:20.797 --> 06:23.840
Augmentation? Self-directed evolution?

06:25.676 --> 06:26.676
I'm intrigued.

06:27.512 --> 06:29.304
Is everyone here a Neolutionist?

06:29.389 --> 06:30.389
No, not everyone.

06:31.641 --> 06:35.811
We've got techno-progressives,
body mods, bio-hackers.

06:35.895 --> 06:37.562
Now, wait, what about your eye?

06:37.772 --> 06:39.523
Is that a permanent augmentation?

06:39.690 --> 06:41.024
It will be, one day.

06:41.150 --> 06:43.151
I've got other enhancements.

06:43.444 --> 06:44.486
Right.

06:45.696 --> 06:51.159
Well, a philosophy so physical
makes for a very handsome tribe.

06:52.620 --> 06:55.789
What about Olivier? Is he enhanced?

06:56.499 --> 06:58.417
Darling, you have no idea.

07:01.712 --> 07:03.839
When's the last time you and Beth
were sexually intimate?

07:04.966 --> 07:06.133
Three days ago.

07:06.175 --> 07:07.843
Who initiated it?

07:08.010 --> 07:09.052
She did.

07:09.512 --> 07:11.388
How would you characterize it?

07:16.144 --> 07:17.853
I'm not sure I understand the question.

07:18.104 --> 07:20.313
Would you describe the
intercourse as intimate,

07:21.107 --> 07:25.026
aggressive, perfunctory, sensual?

07:25.111 --> 07:26.361
I would say passionate.

07:26.654 --> 07:29.156
Beth's generally a "cold fish."

07:29.740 --> 07:30.740
Your words.

07:30.950 --> 07:33.160
It's hard for me to help,
if I don't know what's going on.

07:38.833 --> 07:41.209
All of this architecture...

07:41.419 --> 07:43.670
The psychological profiling,

07:43.963 --> 07:46.214
physical exams, social metrics...

07:46.340 --> 07:48.383
You must know,
it doesn't exist for Beth alone.

07:48.843 --> 07:51.303
- I don't assume anything.
- Of course you do. You're trained...

07:51.554 --> 07:54.306
Surveillance, intelligence, security.

07:55.391 --> 07:57.934
The problem with clandestine ops is that,

07:58.394 --> 08:02.189
information and security
rarely go hand-in-hand.

08:03.274 --> 08:05.942
Which is why I have been told rather late,

08:06.277 --> 08:09.696
that someone is killing our subjects.

08:22.668 --> 08:24.461
Thank you, Tomas.

08:26.422 --> 08:28.215
Why did you let the imposter live?

08:30.885 --> 08:32.928
She's different than the others.

08:33.095 --> 08:35.429
But how could it be different?

08:35.640 --> 08:36.640
I don't know.

08:39.268 --> 08:40.644
We have a connection.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.145
But it's nothing.

08:43.981 --> 08:46.775
Just one of your fingernail clippings,
like the rest of them.

08:46.859 --> 08:49.528
She said I am not the original,

08:50.279 --> 08:52.113
that we are all the same.

09:06.087 --> 09:08.129
How could you believe such a thing?

09:08.464 --> 09:10.173
Forgive me, Tomas.

09:46.043 --> 09:47.919
- Why are you following me?
- I'm not following you.

09:48.754 --> 09:50.463
Fine.

09:50.756 --> 09:52.257
I thought you might want a blowjob.

09:52.508 --> 09:54.426
- Shit. Shit!
- Hey, Paul, Paul.

09:54.552 --> 09:56.803
He's with me, okay? He's my brother.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.388
Jesus Christ, Sarah.

09:58.806 --> 10:01.349
- What are you doing here?
- Sorry. I was worried.

10:02.018 --> 10:03.727
- What happened?
- Not here.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.854
Meet me at home.

10:06.230 --> 10:07.355
Don't bring him.

10:08.649 --> 10:09.941
Okay.

10:10.067 --> 10:11.318
- You all right?
- Yeah.

10:12.486 --> 10:14.404
Your task is more difficult,

10:14.905 --> 10:17.782
since the real Beth Childs
shot our friend Maggie Chen.

10:18.367 --> 10:20.493
The copies, they're harder to find.

10:22.163 --> 10:23.872
Maybe we could use the imposter.

10:24.332 --> 10:26.249
I'd like to see her again.

10:26.334 --> 10:27.542
Tomas.

10:30.338 --> 10:33.465
It will say anything to justify itself.

10:34.884 --> 10:36.468
I'll be strong.

10:37.595 --> 10:40.639
The path to the shepherd
is through the sheep.

10:51.150 --> 10:52.233
Find the impostor,

10:53.110 --> 10:56.905
bleed it for what it knows, then kill it.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.698
You are the original.

11:39.782 --> 11:41.199
You are the light.

11:41.617 --> 11:43.326
I am the original.

11:43.411 --> 11:45.120
I am the light.

11:55.256 --> 11:57.549
Let's go over what you know again.
There's nine of you.

11:57.758 --> 12:00.135
No! There's only one of me,

12:00.261 --> 12:01.720
just like there was one of Beth.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.012
That's not what I meant.

12:03.764 --> 12:05.473
Yeah, Beth figured out there were nine of us,

12:06.225 --> 12:07.225
so far.

12:07.435 --> 12:08.560
I've only met Alison.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.687
Who else knows, besides your brother?

12:11.021 --> 12:12.439
Just me and Alison.

12:12.481 --> 12:13.648
What about Alison's husband?

12:13.691 --> 12:15.942
They've been together since high school.
He's not her monitor.

12:16.026 --> 12:17.026
We don't know that.

12:17.361 --> 12:18.403
Don't lie to me, Sarah.

12:18.487 --> 12:19.654
What is going on?

12:21.449 --> 12:23.032
Is Olivier on to us, or what?

12:23.159 --> 12:25.285
Olivier told me someone
is killing the subjects.

12:25.536 --> 12:26.786
You know anything about that?

12:27.371 --> 12:28.496
No.

12:30.499 --> 12:31.708
Who?

12:31.834 --> 12:33.460
He just said to watch Beth closely,

12:34.003 --> 12:35.420
protect her, make sure she's not aware.

12:35.546 --> 12:36.671
Aware of what?

12:36.756 --> 12:38.757
Of me, of us.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.551
This is high-level shit, Sarah,

12:42.303 --> 12:43.803
an illegal human-cloning trial.

12:43.846 --> 12:45.054
You think I don't know that?

12:45.139 --> 12:46.139
Aren't you the least bit worried

12:46.182 --> 12:47.515
that someone might be trying to kill you?

12:47.933 --> 12:49.017
Yes.

12:50.561 --> 12:51.728
But at least it's not you.

12:54.356 --> 12:55.899
And I still need to see my daughter.

12:56.066 --> 12:58.276
--Take my car.

12:58.819 --> 13:00.570
It's in the underground.

13:00.738 --> 13:01.821
Why?

13:01.864 --> 13:04.365
In case someone is tailing you, all right?

13:04.533 --> 13:06.201
My job is to keep you safe.

13:06.869 --> 13:08.453
At least let me do that.

13:33.395 --> 13:34.521
Shit!

13:34.605 --> 13:36.231
I'm not here to hurt you.

13:36.273 --> 13:37.982
I just want to talk.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.568
Helena,
just stay away from me!

13:41.487 --> 13:43.863
Please. I have an offer for you.

13:44.448 --> 13:45.824
But we must talk.

13:46.242 --> 13:47.408
And eat.

13:49.036 --> 13:50.662
Let's have lunch.

13:51.747 --> 13:52.914
Lunch?

13:58.254 --> 14:00.421
I dreamed that we were friends.

14:00.589 --> 14:01.673
We're not friends.

14:02.424 --> 14:03.550
We will be.

14:04.260 --> 14:05.593
I've seen it.

14:06.804 --> 14:09.430
Don't they feed you, wherever you go?

14:12.476 --> 14:14.185
This is a nice restaurant, isn't it?

14:15.729 --> 14:17.355
Yeah, five stars.

14:20.276 --> 14:21.317
Mmm.

14:22.778 --> 14:24.445
You know my name.

14:25.447 --> 14:26.531
Tell me yours.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.700
This friendship isn't there yet.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.493
You're Russian?

14:31.328 --> 14:32.370
No.

14:33.080 --> 14:35.623
I grew up pure in a convent in Ukraine.

14:37.918 --> 14:39.294
Ukrainian nuns?

14:42.756 --> 14:45.967
Is that who made you kill Katja Obinger
and the others?

14:47.136 --> 14:48.261
No.

14:50.306 --> 14:51.973
They saved me from abandonment.

14:56.103 --> 14:57.228
Excuse me.

14:59.982 --> 15:01.816
I want my knife back,

15:02.318 --> 15:03.443
the one you took from me.

15:03.944 --> 15:07.238
Right, right, the flying-fish blade.

15:08.574 --> 15:10.325
You got a thing for wings, don't you?

15:10.451 --> 15:11.492
Mmm.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.163
I'm supposed to kill you, too.

15:16.999 --> 15:18.291
But you let me live.

15:18.918 --> 15:22.337
Yeah, so let's call it even, okay?

15:22.421 --> 15:25.340
- We'll go our separate ways.
- We'll never be separate.

15:28.385 --> 15:30.970
Tell me the names of the others
and I will spare you.

15:32.306 --> 15:34.933
You move your foot, or I'll stab you again.

16:00.084 --> 16:04.295
You have until midnight to tell me the names.

16:09.093 --> 16:10.718
Call this number,

16:11.720 --> 16:13.346
or you die first.

16:17.142 --> 16:18.393
Bye-bye.

16:44.211 --> 16:46.838
Beth's paperwork's a mess.
It's like she's never done it before.

16:46.922 --> 16:48.756
Jane Doe's fingerprint results
aren't even filed here.

16:48.924 --> 16:50.425
Yeah, I know. We ran them. No match.

16:50.551 --> 16:52.093
Yes, Beth checked the results.

16:52.219 --> 16:55.430
I remember, but even if there's no match,
they should still be here.

16:56.432 --> 16:58.683
The man said double-check everything,

16:58.767 --> 17:00.810
so let's get forensics to pull the hand,

17:00.894 --> 17:01.936
run a fresh set of prints.

17:02.521 --> 17:03.563
Oh, we're hitting the morgue?

17:04.314 --> 17:06.065
- Thought you'd like that.
- Sweet.

17:13.656 --> 17:15.950
- Hello.
- You have a problem.

17:18.328 --> 17:19.619
What kind of a problem?

17:19.954 --> 17:23.040
I just received the results
of Beth's medical exam.

17:23.291 --> 17:24.876
- Okay.
- She's not Beth.

17:26.086 --> 17:28.087
Well, which one is she, if she's not Beth?

17:28.297 --> 17:30.214
That's none of your concern.
Just bring her in.

17:33.385 --> 17:34.427
She's back?

17:34.470 --> 17:37.597
Yeah, and she wants your names by midnight,
or I'm first on her hit list.

17:37.765 --> 17:39.640
Holy shit, Sarah.

17:39.725 --> 17:40.975
Don't worry. I won't give you up.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.477
You know, maybe you should.

17:43.187 --> 17:45.855
Not to Helena, but to Olivier.

17:46.148 --> 17:47.190
What?

17:47.816 --> 17:49.776
You were the one who said,
if your blind subject

17:49.818 --> 17:51.486
suddenly became aware, you'd terminate.

17:51.737 --> 17:52.820
Right, well,

17:53.447 --> 17:55.323
I'm beginning to rethink that.

17:55.532 --> 17:57.033
Great, she's got a new hypothesis.

17:57.117 --> 17:58.951
So, our creators, whoever they are,

17:59.036 --> 18:01.996
they have a tremendous
investment in us, right?

18:02.164 --> 18:05.249
Our conception, our whole lives.

18:05.375 --> 18:07.543
Don't you think they'd try
to protect us from Helena?

18:07.628 --> 18:09.378
They know somebody's whacking us.

18:09.588 --> 18:10.671
Shit.

18:11.590 --> 18:13.758
Yeah, and Paul said it's more of the same...

18:13.842 --> 18:16.302
Observe your lab rat, keep her stupid.

18:16.345 --> 18:19.931
Do you know this futurist,
Dr. Aldous Leekie?

18:20.015 --> 18:21.099
No.

18:21.183 --> 18:24.018
You know, he's the poster boy
for this movement called "Neolution."

18:24.186 --> 18:25.353
Eh, Neolution?

18:25.521 --> 18:28.022
Olivier owns a club called Neolution.

18:28.899 --> 18:29.941
Oh, that's interesting.

18:30.025 --> 18:33.528
Yeah, Felix said it's
a bunch of bio-hack, body-mod freaks.

18:33.695 --> 18:36.864
Uh, Olivier's supposed to have a tail.

18:36.949 --> 18:39.367
- A tail, for real?
- Yeah.

18:39.701 --> 18:40.993
That's what Felix was told.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.496
Okay, well, tail or no tail,

18:44.248 --> 18:45.665
they have a philosophy.

18:45.874 --> 18:49.961
I went with Delphine
to one of Leekie's Neolution lectures.

18:50.045 --> 18:52.088
Cosima, you agreed to stay
away from Delphine.

18:52.214 --> 18:53.965
No, I didn't. You just told me to.

18:54.133 --> 18:57.552
You're going to end up strapped to a gurney,
with doctors giving you the probe.

18:57.761 --> 18:58.886
I probably already have been.

18:59.555 --> 19:01.389
Can we please just get back to Helena?

19:01.557 --> 19:04.559
You know what?
Just stay out of my end, I'll stay out of yours.

19:05.435 --> 19:08.229
Bitch.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.066
Shit!

19:15.237 --> 19:19.365
Shit.

19:26.748 --> 19:27.748
- Hi.
- Hey.

19:27.958 --> 19:29.792
- Sorry, I'm...
- Oh, I'm early?

19:30.210 --> 19:32.461
- No, no, no, no, I'm late, I'm late.
- Okay.

19:32.629 --> 19:36.048
I'm kind of always late, though,
so, kind of always sorry.

19:37.426 --> 19:39.010
- Can you give me two seconds? Just...
- Of course.

19:39.219 --> 19:40.219
Okay.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.327
Where is she?

20:05.120 --> 20:06.329
How'd you get in here?

20:06.496 --> 20:07.705
My key.

20:08.582 --> 20:10.625
We bought this place for you, remember?

20:10.792 --> 20:13.419
So that you would not only appear
attractive to Beth, but,

20:15.130 --> 20:16.672
moderately successful.

20:17.257 --> 20:18.257
Where is your subject?

20:18.342 --> 20:19.634
She's visiting Christine.

20:19.676 --> 20:20.885
You were to keep a close eye on her.

20:20.969 --> 20:22.970
It was a girls' lunch.
I couldn't force the issue.

20:24.473 --> 20:25.473
Astrid.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.233
Your subject isn't who we think she is.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.528
She's an imposter.

20:41.531 --> 20:43.032
I saw herjust a few hours ago.

20:44.785 --> 20:46.410
It wasn't her.

20:46.703 --> 20:48.996
Is this a test of some kind?

20:53.126 --> 20:56.337
The person killing our subjects
looks exactly like Beth.

20:58.131 --> 20:59.674
You mean like a twin?

20:59.758 --> 21:01.842
Yes, Paul, like a twin.

21:02.344 --> 21:03.970
Now, get dressed.

21:51.101 --> 21:52.184
Mom.

21:53.603 --> 21:54.770
Sorry.

21:55.063 --> 21:56.564
Sorry, monkey.

21:56.898 --> 21:59.191
That was wonderful. That was really good.

21:59.276 --> 22:01.402
Well, at least she didn't get your tin ear.

22:02.195 --> 22:03.362
I never learned to play piano.

22:03.697 --> 22:05.573
You were too bad, weren't you?

22:05.657 --> 22:08.826
Eh. Your mom just didn't
work hard enough at it, love.

22:09.995 --> 22:11.537
All right, move over.

22:11.580 --> 22:13.873
I want to teach you some Queen.

22:13.915 --> 22:16.500
- Uncle Felix wasn't bad.
- He was a different kind of bad.

22:17.919 --> 22:19.045
What's this?

22:19.296 --> 22:20.338
Mostly me.

22:20.756 --> 22:21.797
But some of you.

22:50.535 --> 22:55.956
England was burning, Maggie Thatcher
firing on all barrels at lreland,

22:56.583 --> 22:57.792
the Falklands.

22:58.877 --> 23:00.461
She sacked Social Security,

23:00.504 --> 23:04.048
went after the immigrants,
the poor, the unions.

23:06.676 --> 23:08.469
What do you remember about Brixton,

23:09.304 --> 23:11.013
about my people, then?

23:11.264 --> 23:12.515
Mmm, not much.

23:13.975 --> 23:15.226
There were always women around.

23:15.644 --> 23:17.645
Kids would come and go, wards of the state.

23:18.355 --> 23:19.397
They weren't all wards.

23:21.316 --> 23:23.317
We were a, a safe house.

23:24.694 --> 23:28.239
Some of us worked in Social Services,
helping women and kids, refugees,

23:29.074 --> 23:32.076
deportees, radicals on the run,
that kind of thing.

23:32.994 --> 23:34.161
And...

23:35.288 --> 23:37.706
This boy, Carlton.

23:37.833 --> 23:38.833
Yeah, Carlton.

23:39.334 --> 23:40.501
I remember him.

23:40.710 --> 23:41.752
He was a fine boy.

23:42.045 --> 23:43.337
Fine man.

23:44.297 --> 23:50.261
Sometimes his pipeline would bring in
a child in the black, a child to hide.

23:52.639 --> 23:54.014
You were one of them.

23:54.349 --> 23:56.058
Why'd he have to hide me?

23:56.518 --> 23:59.353
We didn't ask what we didn't need to know.

24:00.397 --> 24:04.984
I had the chance to legitimize a child,
so I became your legal guardian.

24:08.155 --> 24:11.073
The last time I heard from Carlton,
he was about to be arrested

24:11.158 --> 24:15.453
and he warned me, he begged me,
to move you away,

24:16.204 --> 24:17.204
to hide you deeper.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.499
So,

24:22.544 --> 24:24.420
I left everyone I knew

24:26.506 --> 24:27.715
and I brought you and Felix here.

24:41.396 --> 24:43.397
I should've left him when I left Paris.

24:43.648 --> 24:45.649
Mmm, yeah, cold turkey,

24:45.775 --> 24:46.901
it's the only way to go.

24:48.069 --> 24:49.236
"Cold turkey," what is that?

24:49.362 --> 24:51.447
Oh, it means "abruptly."

24:51.531 --> 24:53.073
Oh, yes, that's what I should've...

24:53.450 --> 24:56.911
You know, he was supposed
to follow next month, but,

24:57.871 --> 24:59.622
- I changed my mind.

24:59.789 --> 25:01.582
Oh, my God. You're the asshole.

25:01.708 --> 25:04.543
Mmm-hmm, I am the cold-turkey asshole.

25:08.006 --> 25:10.591
Dr. Leekie!
So nice to see you.

25:12.886 --> 25:14.512
Oh, it's Dr. Leekie.

25:14.971 --> 25:16.096
Should we invite him?

25:16.264 --> 25:17.806
Your usual table?

25:19.434 --> 25:20.559
You're single now.

25:20.644 --> 25:23.062
Oh, no, no, no. He's too old.

25:23.104 --> 25:24.480
But his mind is sexy.

25:26.024 --> 25:27.358
I will go get him.

25:39.913 --> 25:41.330
You know you guys already checked
the prints, right?

25:41.414 --> 25:42.414
Oh, yeah.

25:42.624 --> 25:44.458
We're looking at the whole chain again.

25:48.755 --> 25:50.464
Check that shit out. Finger straightener.

25:50.549 --> 25:52.883
You are in the wrong department, Angie.

25:53.134 --> 25:55.135
- You want her?
- Ha-ha.

25:57.180 --> 25:58.931
Hey, you ever seen a postmortem spasm?

26:11.278 --> 26:13.153
Well, I'm still trying to work it out
with my advisors,

26:13.405 --> 26:16.699
but my dissertation is on epigenetic
influence on clone cells.

26:17.158 --> 26:19.201
Oh, it's a fascinating field.

26:19.536 --> 26:21.662
- Yeah.

26:21.913 --> 26:25.207
Are either of you familiar
with our work at the Dyad institute?

26:25.458 --> 26:27.668
Oh, your immunology papers, yes.

26:27.794 --> 26:29.295
Then you'll be interested
in this too, Delphine...

26:30.338 --> 26:35.384
We've created a pluripotent stem cell line
from human baby teeth.

26:35.468 --> 26:39.263
Dr. Leekie, you've perfected a number
of proprietary cloning techniques

26:39.347 --> 26:43.183
in bacteria, amphibians,
insects, human skin grafts.

26:43.268 --> 26:44.268
Correct.

26:44.352 --> 26:47.187
And you're patenting
transgenic embryonic stem cells?

26:47.355 --> 26:49.982
Well, we hope to, once we get
the necessary approvals,

26:50.108 --> 26:53.611
- but that is not public knowledge.

26:53.778 --> 26:57.239
Yeah, I did some digging,
and then just guessed.

26:59.075 --> 27:01.160
She... She is very, very...

27:01.202 --> 27:02.244
What's the word?

27:02.329 --> 27:04.663
"Cheeky," I think, is the word
you're after, "cheeky."

27:04.789 --> 27:07.082
- She is very cheeky, this girl.
- Mmm-hmm.

27:07.292 --> 27:08.751
But that's why I like her.

27:16.509 --> 27:17.885
Beth's dead?

27:20.847 --> 27:22.014
Why?

27:22.307 --> 27:23.557
I can't tell you that.

27:24.434 --> 27:25.809
Who is she?

27:26.561 --> 27:28.562
All I can tell you is that
she comes from Europe.

27:30.482 --> 27:32.524
So, did this imposter kill Beth?

27:32.692 --> 27:33.734
We suspect so.

27:34.569 --> 27:36.070
And she's killed other subjects.

27:36.696 --> 27:39.073
Yet, Paul, she still seems to share your bed.

27:39.282 --> 27:40.908
I don't know what to say, Olivier.

27:41.034 --> 27:42.034
To me, she's still Beth.

27:42.077 --> 27:44.662
Regardless of what you think,
I need you to bring her to me.

27:47.207 --> 27:48.248
Where in Europe?

27:48.625 --> 27:49.958
Does that matter?

27:52.212 --> 27:53.420
Yeah.

27:53.630 --> 27:54.880
It's a big place.

27:55.632 --> 27:57.841
England, Spain, what?

27:58.259 --> 28:00.761
Whether I believe you or not,

28:00.845 --> 28:05.099
loyalty is proven in the moment, after all.

28:07.644 --> 28:11.647
And loyalty has its rewards.

28:14.317 --> 28:16.443
I know what I did, Olivier.

28:17.445 --> 28:19.738
Help make this right, Afghanistan goes away,

28:20.115 --> 28:21.448
you're free of your debt to us.

28:22.283 --> 28:24.076
You get your life back, Paul.

28:24.160 --> 28:25.244
Okay.

28:26.246 --> 28:28.080
Can I have my phone back?

28:29.499 --> 28:33.001
What do you think, the both of you,
of applying to the institute?

28:33.086 --> 28:34.461
Who, us?

28:34.629 --> 28:37.297
Well, why not?
You could be the next Watson and Crick!

28:37.465 --> 28:40.759
Uh, I'm just a geek girl from Berkeley.

28:42.137 --> 28:46.598
I can tell you have
a very unique perspective, Cosima.

28:46.891 --> 28:51.019
Please, you could be on
the cover of Scientific American.

28:51.980 --> 28:54.314
Scientific American doesn't
put scientists on the cover.

28:54.441 --> 28:55.899
Well,

28:55.984 --> 28:57.985
every rule needs to be broken.

29:04.325 --> 29:05.701
Here.

29:11.541 --> 29:16.378
If you... if you have to go back
to go forward, I understand, but...

29:17.005 --> 29:19.131
Just tell me, okay?
It might still be dangerous.

29:20.633 --> 29:21.842
Yeah, I think so, too.

29:24.053 --> 29:27.431
I can keep Kira safe, just like I kept you.

29:52.624 --> 29:53.874
Put it on speaker.

29:55.710 --> 29:57.711
- One more story, mummy?
- Ah!

29:57.879 --> 29:59.880
You already had a story, didn't you?

30:00.632 --> 30:02.341
- It's time for bed. Oh.

30:02.383 --> 30:04.009
Monkey-swing to Felix.

30:04.219 --> 30:06.261
Okay. Oh, my gosh!

30:06.554 --> 30:08.680
- Come on, I'll squeeze you to sleep.
- I'll be right up, okay?

30:12.602 --> 30:13.852
Do your teeth!

30:13.978 --> 30:15.771
- Hello?
- Hi, Beth.

30:17.315 --> 30:19.066
- What's up?
- Not much.

30:19.776 --> 30:21.151
I need you to do something for me.

30:21.277 --> 30:22.402
Okay.

30:22.570 --> 30:23.570
They know you're not Beth.

30:24.072 --> 30:25.113
Run.

30:43.591 --> 30:46.093
Okay, I get it, I do.

30:46.135 --> 30:48.887
Black-ops Paul just proved
he's down with you for real,

30:48.930 --> 30:50.097
but he also said run.

30:50.181 --> 30:52.432
I can't just leave him in there, Fe.

30:52.767 --> 30:54.935
It's probably my fault he's in there,
in the first place.

30:55.061 --> 30:56.520
Well, how do you even know he's still here?

30:56.771 --> 30:59.106
I don't, but I've got to try.

30:59.190 --> 31:02.109
So, then, what are you going to do?
Are you going to take Cosima's bad advice,

31:02.151 --> 31:03.151
fess up to Olivier?

31:05.405 --> 31:06.864
I've got an even worse idea.

31:08.366 --> 31:10.450
How was your day, Paul?

31:11.327 --> 31:14.955
Yes, I also had a pleasant day.

31:15.915 --> 31:17.541
I went working and shopping.

31:23.548 --> 31:24.882
Pardon me. it's work.

31:27.135 --> 31:29.052
It's almost midnight.

31:29.679 --> 31:31.930
- Do you have names for me?
- I do.

31:32.640 --> 31:33.640
Olivier.

31:34.142 --> 31:36.184
That's not the name of a sheep.

31:37.270 --> 31:38.270
A sheep?

31:41.399 --> 31:42.482
Look, Helena...

31:43.318 --> 31:45.986
He's more important than a sheep, okay?

31:46.362 --> 31:47.446
He's a shepherd.

31:48.656 --> 31:50.365
I need you to come meet me.

31:58.583 --> 32:00.500
I saw Paul come up from the basement.

32:00.543 --> 32:02.920
I know that Olivier's office
has got to be down there.

32:08.676 --> 32:11.929
Okay, if I'm not back in 15 minutes,

32:12.221 --> 32:14.431
call Art and tell him everything,

32:14.515 --> 32:17.017
and make sure Kira's safe, yeah?

32:17.101 --> 32:18.185
Yeah, I...

32:18.478 --> 32:19.478
Sarah!

32:19.729 --> 32:20.812
What?

32:21.522 --> 32:22.648
Um...

32:22.857 --> 32:23.857
Just don't die,

32:25.360 --> 32:27.861
because your first funeral
was just agonizing enough.

33:06.651 --> 33:08.026
What are you doing down here?

33:11.072 --> 33:12.364
I'm looking for Olivier.

33:13.032 --> 33:14.408
Who are you?

33:20.456 --> 33:22.916
You know how bad this can get.

33:23.918 --> 33:25.210
I'm not working for anyone.

33:25.336 --> 33:28.005
Then why protect her?
I told you she was a killer.

33:29.257 --> 33:30.799
Was she that good?

33:32.719 --> 33:34.761
I have Beth to see you.

33:44.564 --> 33:45.856
You must be Olivier.

33:46.482 --> 33:49.067
Well, this is unexpected.

33:49.110 --> 33:50.360
She was carrying this.

33:53.990 --> 33:55.449
I told you to run.

33:55.700 --> 33:57.200
Yeah, I don't do run.

33:58.286 --> 33:59.661
Leave us, please.

34:05.001 --> 34:06.001
Come on.

34:19.264 --> 34:20.806
Call me as soon as you can.

34:23.186 --> 34:26.480
All these years, I've never seen
one of you in the flesh.

34:26.647 --> 34:28.648
You're even more beautiful in person.

34:28.815 --> 34:30.067
He thinks you're the killer.

34:32.445 --> 34:33.487
Me?

34:33.905 --> 34:36.156
You've got it all wrong.

34:38.659 --> 34:41.119
We have medical evidence
that proves you're not Beth.

34:42.496 --> 34:44.831
How can you tell that,
if we're genetically identical?

34:45.166 --> 34:46.458
I'm not a scientist.

34:46.626 --> 34:48.502
Well, you've still got the wrong girl.

34:48.543 --> 34:50.504
The one who's killing us is blonde,

34:50.670 --> 34:52.255
she's Ukrainian,

34:52.840 --> 34:54.174
she's a religious nut.

34:54.842 --> 34:57.511
You've created a whole
new brand of fratricide.

34:57.929 --> 35:00.305
You're not listening. it's not me.

35:01.182 --> 35:02.516
Exquisite.

35:03.810 --> 35:05.352
What do you people want?

35:05.645 --> 35:06.853
The future.

35:06.979 --> 35:08.855
Self-directed evolution?

35:10.066 --> 35:12.526
You want to grow a tail, that's your business.

35:12.568 --> 35:14.694
Oh, you know about
my modest enhancement?

35:15.071 --> 35:16.113
You've got a tail?

35:16.197 --> 35:19.116
The fact that I can have a tail,
millions of years after we shed it,

35:19.200 --> 35:21.993
reminds me of what we can achieve.

35:26.958 --> 35:28.708
Would you like to see it?

35:29.502 --> 35:30.710
God, no.

35:33.214 --> 35:35.173
Argentinean bio-hack.

35:35.383 --> 35:37.884
Blood flow, nerve endings,
warm to the touch.

35:38.177 --> 35:41.012
But it's merely performance art,
compared to you.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.307
You are our greatest achievement.

35:48.312 --> 35:49.354
Perhaps later.

36:00.491 --> 36:01.616
This is Olivier.

36:04.120 --> 36:05.412
What's so urgent?

36:05.496 --> 36:06.580
I have her, Aldous.

36:07.415 --> 36:08.623
The killer.

36:12.003 --> 36:15.422
Get her ready to travel.
I'll be there in the morning.

36:15.548 --> 36:16.923
And be careful with her.

36:32.565 --> 36:34.399
She's irresistible, isn't she?

36:37.904 --> 36:40.030
Now I know why you did this.

36:40.698 --> 36:44.367
If I was in your position,
I'd fall in love with her, too.

36:56.255 --> 36:57.380
Hello, friend.

36:57.632 --> 37:00.133
Oh, God! About time.

37:00.343 --> 37:01.968
Do you want to be saved?

37:02.011 --> 37:03.720
Yes, Helena! Untie me.

37:03.804 --> 37:05.305
Give me a name, first.

37:05.514 --> 37:06.806
I gave you Olivier.

37:06.891 --> 37:09.893
I want the name of a sheep, too.

37:16.359 --> 37:18.693
Okay, I'll give you another name.

37:21.822 --> 37:22.864
Tell me.

37:23.491 --> 37:27.202
I offered you a way out,
and you made a fool of me.

37:27.411 --> 37:29.329
You made a fatal error, Paul.

37:30.706 --> 37:32.499
You trusted the wrong person.

37:57.650 --> 37:58.817
Who are you?

38:00.361 --> 38:01.861
I want to see your tail.

38:10.288 --> 38:11.871
Now, show me the tail.

38:12.039 --> 38:13.039
Slowly.

38:17.086 --> 38:18.670
That's good.

38:21.382 --> 38:22.549
Ahh.

38:23.384 --> 38:25.385
How is this possible?

38:27.305 --> 38:29.389
Did you lie with a beast?

38:29.473 --> 38:31.933
Please. You're a miracle.

38:32.101 --> 38:33.393
Let me help you.

38:33.477 --> 38:36.771
Hmm. I have a message for your master.

38:39.066 --> 38:40.275
From Tomas.

38:51.912 --> 38:53.621
I guess there's a few things
I should've told you.

38:53.706 --> 38:54.706
You think?

38:55.041 --> 38:56.750
Come on, Sarah.

39:12.224 --> 39:13.850
Yeah, one sec.

39:18.230 --> 39:19.272
Detective Art Bell.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.608
Hi, um, detective.

39:21.776 --> 39:23.902
You don't know me, but, um,

39:23.944 --> 39:26.071
I need to talk to you about Beth Childs.

39:26.364 --> 39:28.239
Beth Childs? What about her?

39:28.616 --> 39:31.117
I was told to call, um...

39:31.494 --> 39:32.786
Shit! Christ!

39:32.828 --> 39:34.245
- Let's go.
- Wrong number.

39:35.581 --> 39:36.790
Hello?

39:37.833 --> 39:39.000
Hello!

40:13.702 --> 40:15.245
You had to give Helena a name?

40:15.579 --> 40:17.288
Yeah, mine.

40:17.998 --> 40:19.499
I told her who I was.

40:19.583 --> 40:20.750
Sarah?

40:21.252 --> 40:23.670
Psst! She's got a thing for me.

40:34.682 --> 40:35.682
Mmm.

40:36.976 --> 40:39.310
Well, three's a crowd,

40:39.353 --> 40:42.355
so I'm going to go get drunk
by myself at Bobby's Bar.

40:43.315 --> 40:44.774
We can't go back to the townhouse.

40:44.984 --> 40:46.860
It's not safe. They'll be looking for us.

40:48.737 --> 40:50.155
We should...

41:15.431 --> 41:18.141
Working with Dr. Leekie could be
the opportunity of a lifetime.

41:18.225 --> 41:20.310
I know.

41:21.770 --> 41:23.188
Then why are you being so coy?

41:25.566 --> 41:29.486
Don't you think it's time
we admit what this is really about?

41:41.290 --> 41:42.665
I, um...

41:43.292 --> 41:45.376
- Oh. Oh, God, Delphine.

41:45.753 --> 41:48.087
- Uh, did I make a huge mistake?
- No.

41:48.172 --> 41:49.255
I have to go.

41:53.177 --> 41:54.177
It's okay.

41:55.471 --> 41:57.263
- Bye.
- Delphine, just...

42:07.858 --> 42:09.609
Hey, I'm going home.

42:09.777 --> 42:12.946
- You should, too.
- What, and miss all the fun?

42:15.449 --> 42:16.533
Art!

42:17.076 --> 42:18.868
Art, you got to see this.

42:19.078 --> 42:20.453
Holy shit.

42:20.621 --> 42:22.372
It's a match on the Jane Doe print.

42:25.709 --> 42:27.502
Who's Sarah Manning?

42:28.295 --> 42:30.421
And why the hell does she look like Beth?

42:38.556 --> 42:40.306
- Siobhan Sadler?
- Who wants to know?

42:40.432 --> 42:42.225
Detectives Bell and Deangelis.

42:42.393 --> 42:44.310
Get out of the car, Alison!

42:44.687 --> 42:48.064
You have no idea
who you're dealing with!

42:50.442 --> 42:51.693
Where are you with Cosima?

42:51.860 --> 42:53.945
I can't stop thinking about that kiss.

42:54.029 --> 42:56.447
- Welcome to the big picture.
- Yes, sir.

42:56.824 --> 42:59.367
Siobhan, this is Alison Hendrix.
