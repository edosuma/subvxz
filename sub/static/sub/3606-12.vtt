00:00.101 --> 00:04.203
Kara: <i> When I was a child,</i>
<i> my planet Krypton was dying.</i>

00:04.205 --> 00:07.339
<i> I was sent to earth</i>
<i> to protect my cousin.</i>

00:07.341 --> 00:09.208
<i> But my pod got</i>
<i> knocked off-course</i>

00:09.210 --> 00:10.943
<i> and by the time I got here,</i>

00:10.945 --> 00:15.180
<i> my cousin</i>
<i> had already grown up</i>
<i> and become superman.</i>

00:15.182 --> 00:17.049
<i> And so I hid my powers</i>

00:17.051 --> 00:21.620
<i> until recently</i>
<i> when an accident forced me</i>
<i> to reveal myself to the world.</i>

00:21.622 --> 00:24.890
<i> To most people</i>
<i> I'm an assistant</i>
<i> at catco worldwide media.</i>

00:24.892 --> 00:29.528
<i> But in secret, I work with my</i>
<i> adoptive sister for the deo</i>

00:29.530 --> 00:31.630
<i> to protect my city</i>
<i> from alien life</i>

00:31.632 --> 00:34.266
<i> and anyone else</i>
<i> that means to cause it harm.</i>

00:35.636 --> 00:38.137
<i> I am Supergirl.</i>

00:38.139 --> 00:40.039
Kara:
<i> Previously on</i> Supergirl...

00:40.041 --> 00:42.674
Cat: <i> James' problem is having</i>
<i> his girlfriend at work</i>

00:42.676 --> 00:46.912
while he's having, whatever
he's having with someone else.

00:46.914 --> 00:49.581
Kara: <i> There is nothing</i>
<i> more important than family.</i>

00:49.583 --> 00:51.483
<i> All my love, mom.</i>

00:51.485 --> 00:52.384
Adam?

00:52.386 --> 00:54.219
(Chuckles) I got your letter.

00:54.221 --> 00:56.388
Oh, you're asking me out.

00:56.390 --> 00:57.623
How about tomorrow night?

00:57.625 --> 00:59.758
Huh, sisters.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.928
<i> We need to rely on ourselves,</i>
<i> not aliens in capes.</i>

01:02.930 --> 01:05.397
(Explosion)

01:05.399 --> 01:07.199
Yeah. That is
definitely not me.

01:27.888 --> 01:29.688
(Bio-diagnostic lock beeps)

01:37.164 --> 01:39.631
(ekg machine beeping steadily)

02:00.855 --> 02:02.121
(Choking)

02:13.167 --> 02:14.933
(Gasping)

02:14.935 --> 02:16.401
She's alive.

02:27.648 --> 02:31.483
"Death is the veil which
those who live call life.

02:34.021 --> 02:37.456
"They sleep,
and it is lifted."

02:38.459 --> 02:41.293
Shelley, <i> prometheus unbound.</i>

02:41.295 --> 02:43.095
In this room,
I've created things

02:43.097 --> 02:46.231
that have enabled
people to live in ways
they never imagined.

02:46.233 --> 02:47.666
Changed the world.

02:48.536 --> 02:50.369
All that means nothing now.

02:51.005 --> 02:52.571
Because of you.

02:52.573 --> 02:55.707
My most perfect creation.

02:57.344 --> 03:00.646
Together, we won't
just change the world.

03:00.648 --> 03:03.382
We will change
the meaning of life itself.

03:06.287 --> 03:07.719
Do you understand me?

03:11.392 --> 03:12.891
Yes, my lord.

03:22.636 --> 03:24.803
Not exactly one
for your greatest hits reel.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.538
I sent a team
to scan the area.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.574
No signs of
extraterrestrial activity,

03:28.576 --> 03:31.410
so we can probably rule out
an alien shapeshifter.

03:31.412 --> 03:33.345
Unless there's something
you're not telling us.

03:33.347 --> 03:36.148
The skirt was surprisingly
comfortable, but no.

03:36.150 --> 03:38.016
Who could she be?
Is it a clone?

03:38.018 --> 03:39.318
Unlikely.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.653
Even if an enemy
had harvested your DNA

03:41.655 --> 03:43.388
when you came out
as Supergirl,

03:43.390 --> 03:45.924
the embryo would
still be in gestation.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.492
What about Maxwell lord?

03:47.494 --> 03:49.428
Could he have done something
to the young woman you saw

03:49.430 --> 03:50.762
when you broke into his lab?

03:50.764 --> 03:52.297
She was comatose,

03:52.299 --> 03:54.700
her cerebral cortex
functioning was
almost nonexistent.

03:54.702 --> 03:56.735
Bringing her back
to even partial consciousness

03:56.737 --> 03:58.704
would be like
raising the dead.

04:00.074 --> 04:01.373
Are you sure?

04:01.375 --> 04:03.008
Maxwell lord does
have a god complex.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.876
But he's not an actual god.

04:11.852 --> 04:15.587
Winn, Ms. Grant
scheduled a content
meeting in her office,

04:15.589 --> 04:17.089
but after that,
we need to meet.

04:17.091 --> 04:19.458
Is this about the truck
you threw into a mountain?

04:20.461 --> 04:22.761
Yes, but... (Clears throat)

04:22.763 --> 04:24.796
Um, that...
(Whispers) That was not me.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.965
Nope. No, not interested.
(Clears throat)

04:29.703 --> 04:32.271
(Whispering)
Okay, fine, I'm interested.
Who was it?

04:32.273 --> 04:34.973
Does this mean
I'm on a planet where
you're talking to me again?

04:34.975 --> 04:36.475
(Elevator bell dings)

04:36.477 --> 04:39.111
Oh, my god, I forgot...

04:39.113 --> 04:41.313
Ms. Grant, I'm sorry,
if you'll just
give me a minute,

04:41.315 --> 04:44.549
I'll go get your latte.

04:44.551 --> 04:48.053
Oh, I had a little
extra time this morning,

04:48.055 --> 04:50.422
so I stopped and I got my own.

04:50.424 --> 04:53.258
Oh, and I almost forgot,

04:53.260 --> 04:55.494
I picked one up for you, too.

04:55.496 --> 04:57.529
Spiced pumpkin with extra foam

04:57.531 --> 04:59.331
and a little cinnamon
sprinkled on top.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.033
That's actually my go-to.

05:02.169 --> 05:03.568
Hmm.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.982
All right, people,
how are we going
to frame this?

05:16.984 --> 05:19.217
Give me headlines
that will grab eyeballs.

05:19.219 --> 05:20.585
(Clears throat)

05:23.057 --> 05:24.122
You, go.

05:24.124 --> 05:25.691
Supergirl gone rogue.

05:25.693 --> 05:27.993
Mmm, well, Supergirl gone wild
would be better, Kelly,

05:27.995 --> 05:29.127
but it's still not right.

05:29.129 --> 05:31.463
-What else?
-Supergirl/supermenace?

05:31.465 --> 05:34.399
Are you asking me
or are you telling me?

05:34.401 --> 05:35.934
Uh...

05:35.936 --> 05:37.869
Exactly, that's why it's not
a good headline, Derek.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.371
What else?

05:39.373 --> 05:41.707
(Under her breath)
Maybe it's not
even Supergirl at all.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.015
Kara.

05:52.186 --> 05:54.653
Well, that was, um...

05:56.490 --> 05:58.056
Interesting.

05:58.792 --> 05:59.991
Say more.

05:59.993 --> 06:02.427
Maybe it's an imposter?

06:02.429 --> 06:04.763
Pretending to be Supergirl?

06:04.765 --> 06:06.164
Hmm, go on.

06:06.166 --> 06:09.901
I don't know, uh,
maybe it's someone trying to

06:09.903 --> 06:11.503
discredit her.

06:11.505 --> 06:13.004
Cat: Oh, I like that angle.

06:13.006 --> 06:14.773
It gives our girl
the benefit of the doubt.

06:14.775 --> 06:16.675
It shows that we're choosing

06:16.677 --> 06:19.311
not to believe
the worst in people.

06:19.313 --> 06:20.645
Yes.

06:20.647 --> 06:22.481
Yes, I can see
the headline clearly now.

06:22.483 --> 06:25.283
The word Supergirl,
with a question mark.

06:25.285 --> 06:27.319
As in, "Supergirl?"

06:27.321 --> 06:31.456
Hmm, that's good, that's good.
All right, everybody get out.

06:31.458 --> 06:35.227
Ms. Grant, um,
can I ask you a question?

06:35.229 --> 06:37.129
Oh! Oh.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.599
Yes, my door is always open.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.134
You're not just
being nice to me

06:42.136 --> 06:43.835
because I'm going on a date
with your son, are you?

06:43.837 --> 06:47.672
Oh, is that still happening?

06:48.342 --> 06:49.808
(Chuckles nervously)

06:52.079 --> 06:54.379
It's like <i> invasion of</i>
<i> the body snatchers.</i>

06:54.381 --> 06:57.516
That thing in Ms. Grant's
office looks like Ms. Grant.

06:57.518 --> 06:59.251
She sounds like Ms. Grant,
but...

06:59.253 --> 07:02.687
But she's being nice to me
in a way Ms. Grant
never would.

07:02.689 --> 07:04.289
Well, just enjoy it
while it lasts.

07:04.291 --> 07:06.758
Yeah, I'd try but
it's hard to enjoy anything

07:06.760 --> 07:09.261
when there's a body-double
of me flying around the city,

07:09.263 --> 07:10.662
making me look bad.

07:10.664 --> 07:12.364
We're on it. What do you need?

07:12.366 --> 07:14.499
(Sighs) Maxwell lord had
a woman in his lab,

07:14.501 --> 07:15.867
she could be tied to this.

07:15.869 --> 07:17.636
Can you check local hospitals

07:17.638 --> 07:20.505
to see if any
comatose patients have
gone missing recently?

07:20.507 --> 07:22.274
My age, my height, my weight.

07:22.276 --> 07:25.310
Yeah, yeah, I know all those.

07:25.312 --> 07:28.046
-(Text message pings)
-What, I measured her
for her suit.

07:30.451 --> 07:31.716
(Chuckles)

07:33.253 --> 07:35.086
Who was that text from?

07:35.088 --> 07:38.056
-No one. I... I...
-You are blushing.

07:38.058 --> 07:41.359
(Chuckles)
I am not, it's hot in here...

07:41.361 --> 07:42.894
You guys aren't hot?

07:42.896 --> 07:44.296
You're lying.

07:44.298 --> 07:47.065
I can tell, there's a thing
that you do with your nose.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.300
Uh, was it a guy?

07:48.302 --> 07:50.235
If you must know,

07:50.237 --> 07:53.238
it's a text from Adam,
confirming our date tonight.

07:55.542 --> 07:57.309
Uh, Adam foster?

07:57.311 --> 08:01.213
You're going on a date
with cat Grant's son?

08:01.215 --> 08:02.280
Mmm-hmm.

08:02.282 --> 08:04.683
And who asked who out?

08:05.752 --> 08:07.452
Adam asked me, actually.

08:07.454 --> 08:08.820
That's great!

08:10.190 --> 08:11.423
It is?

08:11.425 --> 08:13.725
Yeah. I mean, you know,
he seems like a...

08:13.727 --> 08:15.193
Like a terrific guy, so...

08:15.195 --> 08:16.795
You've never even met him.

08:16.797 --> 08:20.165
But I saw him,
and you can tell
he's good people.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.833
-Okay?
-Yeah.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.272
(Clears throat)
I have to get back upstairs,
though.

08:27.274 --> 08:29.841
Uh, have a great time tonight.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.243
-Thanks, yeah.
-Yeah.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.154
(Electricity buzzing)

08:46.326 --> 08:47.392
Anything good on TV?

08:47.394 --> 08:48.693
(Muttering) Supergirl.

08:49.496 --> 08:51.062
-Supergirl.
-Yes.

08:51.064 --> 08:52.197
What is Supergirl?

08:53.066 --> 08:56.034
Bad. Very bad.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.135
Very bad.

08:57.137 --> 08:59.905
So bad she needs
to be stopped forever

08:59.907 --> 09:01.940
and replaced
with someone else.

09:01.942 --> 09:03.975
-My own Supergirl.
-(Electric shock continuing)

09:03.977 --> 09:06.044
Who's there to protect me
and the planet?

09:06.046 --> 09:07.178
-Me.
-Yes.

09:07.180 --> 09:09.881
Which brings me
to my next question,

09:09.883 --> 09:12.951
what do we do to bad people?

09:12.953 --> 09:14.052
We...

09:16.023 --> 09:17.088
...kill them.

09:27.935 --> 09:30.535
So, apparently,
my mom got us a table

09:30.537 --> 09:32.704
at Mario batali's
new restaurant.

09:32.706 --> 09:35.140
No, she didn't.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.642
Who do you think makes
all her dinner reservations?

09:39.179 --> 09:40.245
Me.

09:40.247 --> 09:41.813
(Both laughing)

09:41.815 --> 09:43.682
I mean, she asked me to call

09:43.684 --> 09:46.618
but I just had a feeling
that place wouldn't be
quite your style.

09:46.620 --> 09:47.886
Our style.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.022
You're amazing.

09:52.726 --> 09:53.825
No, I'm not.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.126
-Yeah, you are.
-No...

09:55.128 --> 09:56.294
Yeah.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.932
Not just anybody would
have sent me that letter.

10:01.802 --> 10:04.035
-Sure they would.
-No.

10:04.037 --> 10:05.937
No. Most people
wouldn't have cared.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.173
You're different, Kara.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.208
You see people.

10:11.345 --> 10:12.611
You understand them.

10:12.613 --> 10:14.112
And it makes me
wish that I could...

10:16.583 --> 10:17.782
No.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.384
It makes you wish what?
Tell me.

10:19.386 --> 10:22.187
It makes me wish
that I could get the chance

10:22.189 --> 10:23.822
to do that for you.

10:30.597 --> 10:33.231
-Was that too much?
-No.

10:33.233 --> 10:38.703
No, I think... I think
that would be really nice.

10:38.705 --> 10:41.072
Newscaster: (On TV)
<i> Now to a story</i>
<i> we are covering live.</i>

10:41.074 --> 10:43.708
<i> The national island tramway</i>
<i> is dangling,</i>

10:43.710 --> 10:46.144
<i> leaving passengers</i>
<i> stranded and in peril.</i>

10:46.146 --> 10:48.913
<i> Ncpd and emergency</i>
<i> rescue workers are en route</i>

10:48.915 --> 10:50.582
<i> but eyewitness</i>
<i> accounts suggest</i>

10:50.584 --> 10:52.684
<i> they may not</i>
<i> get there in time.</i>

10:52.686 --> 10:54.853
I'm sorry. I have to go.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.221
You're bailing?

10:56.223 --> 10:59.557
No. I'm having the best time,
i really am.

10:59.559 --> 11:01.092
My grandma, she fell.

11:01.094 --> 11:02.994
And I have to get
to the hospital.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.729
-I'll go with you...
-No, it's okay. Stay, stay.

11:04.731 --> 11:06.765
It's all right.
I'm really sorry.

11:19.913 --> 11:22.714
It's okay. I'm going
to get you out of here.

11:46.640 --> 11:47.906
It's you.

11:48.542 --> 11:51.409
Where did you come from?

11:51.411 --> 11:54.813
Did somebody send you?
Are they making you do this?

11:54.815 --> 11:57.716
We kill Supergirl.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.054
(Passengers screaming)

12:16.937 --> 12:19.104
(Passengers screaming)

12:40.927 --> 12:42.360
She's as strong as me.

12:42.362 --> 12:45.196
She flies like me,
she fights like me,

12:45.198 --> 12:47.632
except for the fact that
she talks like cookie monster,

12:47.634 --> 12:49.067
she is exactly like me.

12:49.069 --> 12:51.035
Red tornado was programmed
to analyze and mimic

12:51.037 --> 12:53.338
your fighting style
and velocity.

12:53.340 --> 12:54.539
Dr. morrow is dead,

12:54.541 --> 12:56.841
but perhaps his schematics
for an android...

12:56.843 --> 12:58.209
But she is not an android.

12:58.211 --> 12:59.577
That's what
I'm trying to tell you.

12:59.579 --> 13:01.246
I looked into her eyes

13:01.248 --> 13:03.515
and there was
someone looking back.

13:03.517 --> 13:07.652
She has a soul.
And somehow it's like mine.

13:07.654 --> 13:10.421
I know you said that a clone
was impossible, but Alex,

13:10.423 --> 13:13.992
she does not just
look like me. She is me.

13:13.994 --> 13:16.694
The good news is, if she
is genetically identical

13:16.696 --> 13:18.062
or even similar to you,

13:18.064 --> 13:20.598
she has the same weakness.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.367
We can use kryptonite.

13:22.369 --> 13:24.002
Hank henshaw: We have
to subdue her somehow.

13:24.004 --> 13:26.337
It's okay. We won't
use enough to hurt her.

13:26.339 --> 13:29.040
-Not seriously, anyway.
-I'll get on it.

13:37.617 --> 13:39.017
Do you think
i said something wrong?

13:39.019 --> 13:40.652
No, no, no, no, no.

13:40.654 --> 13:42.554
She's just skittish, that one.

13:42.556 --> 13:44.455
Like... like a horse.

13:45.892 --> 13:47.959
Um, Adam...

13:49.763 --> 13:52.130
I do feel bad that
your dinner ended early,

13:52.132 --> 13:55.266
but I hope I wasn't
a disappointing substitute.

13:55.268 --> 13:57.068
No, it was good.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.870
It's been nice spending
time with you.

13:58.872 --> 13:59.938
Oh.

13:59.940 --> 14:02.307
Mmm. For me too.

14:02.309 --> 14:04.642
(Breathless) Ms. Grant.
Adam. You're here.

14:04.644 --> 14:06.511
-I am.
-We are.

14:06.513 --> 14:09.581
I... I totally forgot
to call you back last night.

14:09.583 --> 14:11.149
I'm so sorry, that was my bad.

14:11.151 --> 14:13.017
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.319
(Sarcastically) Oh, phew!

14:14.321 --> 14:16.120
I get it,
life in national city.

14:16.122 --> 14:19.624
-(Chuckles)
-But, uh, you do
owe me a rain-check.

14:19.626 --> 14:21.426
-Of course.
-Tonight.

14:21.428 --> 14:22.493
Okay.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.631
-Oops, I'm sorry.
-(Both chuckle)

14:30.370 --> 14:33.538
You two have not
had your first kiss yet?

14:33.540 --> 14:38.176
Kara, you are like a character
from a Jane Austen novel.

14:38.178 --> 14:40.411
-Bizarro.
-It's not that weird.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.447
We've only been out
a couple of times.

14:42.449 --> 14:45.383
No, I named her bizarro.

14:48.321 --> 14:51.422
I named Supergirl,
why not her evil twin?

14:54.327 --> 14:57.762
Winn: Jane Doe
matching your height,
weight and coloring...

14:57.764 --> 14:59.397
She was taken
in national city general

14:59.399 --> 15:00.932
about two years ago
after a car accident.

15:00.934 --> 15:02.000
She's been in a coma
ever since.

15:02.002 --> 15:03.735
Where is she now?

15:03.737 --> 15:05.837
Good question.
She was transferred
to a private facility,

15:05.839 --> 15:08.406
a prometheus genetics.

15:08.408 --> 15:11.242
-Three guesses who owns it.
-Max lord.

15:11.244 --> 15:14.045
Bingo. Now here's the other
thing that's pretty upsetting.

15:14.047 --> 15:15.847
Over the past few months,

15:15.849 --> 15:20.251
six more comatose
Jane does have been
claimed by prometheus.

15:21.755 --> 15:23.254
Seven girls?

15:23.256 --> 15:26.524
I mean, maybe
it's taken him seven tries

15:26.526 --> 15:29.260
to create
the perfect doppelganger.

15:29.696 --> 15:30.962
(Exhales)

15:35.902 --> 15:37.969
I ordered you
to kill Supergirl.

15:38.772 --> 15:41.673
You say Supergirl bad.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.410
But Supergirl help people.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.246
Supergirl not bad.

15:52.152 --> 15:53.685
I understand.

15:54.821 --> 15:56.688
You share her DNA.

15:56.690 --> 15:59.557
It's natural that you should
want to see the best in her.

16:01.561 --> 16:04.762
But who do you trust,
Supergirl or me?

16:04.764 --> 16:09.500
Who do you love?
Supergirl or me?

16:09.502 --> 16:13.271
Just remember,
the world is a very
complicated place, kiddo.

16:15.542 --> 16:19.344
Sometimes things
that seem to be good,

16:20.146 --> 16:24.115
are really very, very bad.

16:31.257 --> 16:33.891
It's you.
It's always been you.

16:33.893 --> 16:37.428
Remind me,
what it is I'm meant
to have done this time?

16:37.430 --> 16:40.264
I know about the girls, Max.

16:40.266 --> 16:42.300
-Those women had lives.
-They were brain dead.

16:42.302 --> 16:44.202
Zero chance of recovery.

16:44.204 --> 16:45.470
You treated them
like Guinea pigs.

16:45.472 --> 16:47.872
Or gave them a chance to live.

16:47.874 --> 16:49.841
That's not a confession,
by the way.

16:49.843 --> 16:51.609
But if somebody,

16:51.611 --> 16:54.545
if I were to do
the things you're implying,

16:54.547 --> 16:58.349
all it would take
is an elementary
genetic synthesis.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.051
Isolate Supergirl's genome,

17:00.053 --> 17:02.820
flood the subject
with a concentrated
infusion of DNA.

17:02.822 --> 17:05.623
How did you get
Supergirl's DNA?

17:05.625 --> 17:07.759
Maxwell: We all leave
little traces of ourselves

17:07.761 --> 17:09.560
nearly everywhere we go.

17:09.562 --> 17:10.695
An errant skin cell.

17:10.697 --> 17:13.097
A stray hair.

17:13.099 --> 17:14.499
Or maybe just
a few seconds with the arm

17:14.501 --> 17:17.502
from a rogue military android.

17:17.504 --> 17:19.504
Red tornado, wasn't it?
(Chuckles)

17:19.506 --> 17:22.140
Which you helpfully
delivered to me
for my perusal.

17:22.142 --> 17:23.508
You son of a bitch.

17:23.510 --> 17:25.710
Ooh, language.

17:25.712 --> 17:29.380
You seem awfully upset
that an extraterrestrial's
DNA was stolen.

17:29.382 --> 17:34.919
Makes me wonder
if you and Supergirl are more
than just work buddies.

17:34.921 --> 17:37.522
-Don't play games.
-Never.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.792
It's a simple
evolutionary equation.

17:41.628 --> 17:43.961
Survival of the fittest.

17:43.963 --> 17:45.363
For humanity to survive,

17:45.365 --> 17:47.365
we need to be
fitter than them.

17:48.301 --> 17:52.270
You think you're
humanity's savior, Max?

17:52.272 --> 17:54.305
You're nothing
but a common criminal.

17:54.307 --> 17:59.110
You have no proof
I've ever hurt anyone,
your hands are tied.

17:59.112 --> 18:01.245
But if you do try anything,

18:02.348 --> 18:05.016
things will get
very bad for you

18:05.018 --> 18:06.451
and the people you love.

18:07.053 --> 18:08.252
Are you threatening me?

18:08.254 --> 18:10.822
Supergirl is the threat, Alex.

18:10.824 --> 18:15.193
This... bizarro?
She's humanity's guardian.

18:16.096 --> 18:17.562
You're welcome.

18:21.067 --> 18:22.467
May the best girl win.

18:31.411 --> 18:33.211
He all but admitted it.

18:33.213 --> 18:35.413
He took all those girls.
All seven.

18:35.415 --> 18:37.348
He made the bizarro you.

18:37.350 --> 18:38.683
Is that what we're calling it?

18:38.685 --> 18:40.251
Another catco trademark.

18:40.253 --> 18:42.253
So, how do we stop her?

18:42.255 --> 18:44.555
We arm our agents
with kryptonite darts

18:44.557 --> 18:46.157
and we take down this bizarro

18:46.159 --> 18:47.492
the next time
she shows her face.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.060
But she's not
the villain here,

18:49.062 --> 18:50.328
she's the victim.

18:50.330 --> 18:52.196
It's Max we should
be going after.

18:52.198 --> 18:54.332
You're acting
as if she's a person,

18:54.334 --> 18:56.300
and not an experiment.

18:56.302 --> 19:00.872
That's what she is, Kara,
she's one of Max's
deranged science projects.

19:00.874 --> 19:02.507
So why don't we
just arrest Max?

19:02.509 --> 19:04.742
We're the deo, we don't exist.

19:04.744 --> 19:07.545
And we certainly
don't have the authority
to arrest private citizens,

19:07.547 --> 19:09.947
especially not
world-famous billionaires.

19:09.949 --> 19:11.682
Briefing the strike team
in 10.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.754
Kara, there's something
i wanted to tell you,

19:16.756 --> 19:18.356
not in front of Hank.

19:19.692 --> 19:21.893
When I was with Max,

19:21.895 --> 19:23.127
he mentioned you.

19:23.129 --> 19:24.462
What? In what way?

19:24.464 --> 19:26.264
Like, in a weird way,

19:26.266 --> 19:28.232
as if he knew we were related.

19:28.234 --> 19:30.368
I'm mean, there's no
way he could, is there?

19:30.370 --> 19:33.271
No. No. No way. No.

19:33.273 --> 19:36.107
He's just... he's trying
to get into your head,
he's trying to rattle you.

19:36.109 --> 19:38.409
That's what he does. Jerk.

19:39.312 --> 19:40.711
-(Sighs)
-What are you doing?

19:40.713 --> 19:42.113
I'm texting Adam.

19:42.115 --> 19:43.948
I can't go on a date,

19:43.950 --> 19:46.284
not while Max
and bizarro are out there,

19:46.286 --> 19:47.785
it's too crazy right now.

19:47.787 --> 19:48.819
No. No. No. No. No. No.

19:48.821 --> 19:51.222
That is exactly
why you should go.

19:51.224 --> 19:52.723
It's never going
to be good timing,

19:52.725 --> 19:54.926
so you can't wait around
until it gets better.

19:54.928 --> 19:57.828
You may be Supergirl,
but you're Kara danvers too,

19:57.830 --> 19:59.330
and she deserves a life.

19:59.332 --> 20:02.700
So, go.
We'll hold down the fort.

20:02.702 --> 20:03.768
Thanks, Alex.

20:07.974 --> 20:10.875
James: How do you feel
about drowning our sorrows?

20:10.877 --> 20:12.376
I know what my sorrows are.

20:12.378 --> 20:15.379
What, uh... what sorrows
exactly do you have, sir?

20:15.381 --> 20:17.815
(Chuckles) Bottoms up.

20:17.817 --> 20:18.883
Winn: Yeah.

20:25.758 --> 20:27.592
What are you doing, man?

20:27.594 --> 20:29.160
Having a drink with a friend.

20:29.162 --> 20:32.029
-No. With Kara.
-Huh?

20:32.031 --> 20:35.399
Why'd you tell her
you were happy about
her and Adam?

20:35.401 --> 20:37.702
Because she likes him.

20:37.704 --> 20:39.804
And that's what she
wants me to say, man.
Come on.

20:39.806 --> 20:40.905
No!

20:42.108 --> 20:43.574
Look, look...

20:43.576 --> 20:46.811
Dude, I've been stuck
in the friend zone so long

20:46.813 --> 20:49.347
that I'm just thinking about
buying some investment
property here.

20:49.349 --> 20:50.648
(Chuckling)

20:50.650 --> 20:53.351
But you,
you could be with her,

20:53.353 --> 20:55.386
and you know it.

20:55.388 --> 20:57.288
Literally, all you have
to do is say the word.

20:57.290 --> 20:58.623
So why don't you?

20:59.525 --> 21:01.726
Winn, I'm in a relationship.

21:01.728 --> 21:03.661
Look, dude, I know
that you care about Lucy,

21:03.663 --> 21:05.463
you don't have
to convince me, I get it.

21:05.465 --> 21:07.765
But nobody wants to be
in a relationship with someone

21:07.767 --> 21:10.001
that wants to be
with somebody else.

21:17.310 --> 21:19.110
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

21:19.112 --> 21:20.177
(Winn claps hands)

21:20.179 --> 21:21.279
(Winn exhales)

21:21.281 --> 21:22.813
-Good talk.
-Yeah.

21:25.451 --> 21:26.717
Leave the bottle.

21:27.153 --> 21:28.419
(Chuckles)

21:33.459 --> 21:35.626
Kara: Working for your mom
has its ups and downs,

21:35.628 --> 21:37.561
but it's good for me.

21:37.563 --> 21:40.998
She's been a really
great mentor to me,
whether she knows it or not.

21:42.201 --> 21:43.634
Adam: What about your mom?

21:44.304 --> 21:45.469
Are you guys close?

21:45.471 --> 21:48.339
We were. But she died.

21:49.075 --> 21:50.508
My dad too.

21:52.512 --> 21:54.679
Oh, my god. What happened?

21:54.681 --> 21:57.114
Uh, there...
There was an accident.

21:57.116 --> 21:58.649
I wasn't there.

22:01.387 --> 22:02.887
Kara, I'm so sorry.

22:02.889 --> 22:05.156
No, no.
It happened a long time ago.

22:05.158 --> 22:07.591
And I was adopted by
this really wonderful family,

22:07.593 --> 22:08.826
who's great to me.

22:08.828 --> 22:12.396
So, everything
had a happy ending.

22:13.132 --> 22:14.398
But?

22:15.535 --> 22:20.071
Well, after that, it's...
It's...

22:22.041 --> 22:25.810
It's always been hard for me
to feel normal, I guess.

22:27.447 --> 22:30.381
You know, like I'm where
I'm supposed to be.

22:31.718 --> 22:34.418
Does that make any sense?

22:34.420 --> 22:37.588
Yes. But Kara,
i should tell you something.

22:37.590 --> 22:39.690
(Whispers)
No one ever feels normal.

23:05.852 --> 23:06.917
Kara!

23:12.759 --> 23:13.991
(Groans)

23:17.029 --> 23:20.164
Please, please,
you're making a mistake.

23:45.725 --> 23:46.791
(Groans)

23:50.163 --> 23:53.464
Please, please,
you don't want to do this.

24:08.448 --> 24:10.147
(Blowing)

24:23.629 --> 24:24.895
(Both grunting)

24:32.472 --> 24:34.138
We've got her in our sights.

24:38.811 --> 24:39.877
Fire!

24:42.515 --> 24:43.781
Again!

24:45.218 --> 24:46.584
Alex, no!

24:47.086 --> 24:48.152
She's down!

24:48.154 --> 24:49.587
Are you all right?

25:00.266 --> 25:01.599
Alex: It's the kryptonite.

25:01.601 --> 25:05.169
It's degrading her.
It's corrupting her.

25:10.343 --> 25:12.142
(Growling)

25:13.513 --> 25:16.213
Hate you!

25:19.986 --> 25:22.319
(Groans)

25:22.321 --> 25:25.055
It's the kryptonite artillery,
you can't go after her.

25:25.057 --> 25:26.223
Not now.

25:28.561 --> 25:30.728
Kara, I was just
trying to protect you.

25:30.730 --> 25:32.630
Alex, you were right,
he knows.

25:32.632 --> 25:35.733
-What are you talking about?
-Maxwell lord.

25:35.735 --> 25:37.935
Bizarro didn't come after me
as Supergirl this time,

25:37.937 --> 25:40.604
she came after me as Kara.

25:41.474 --> 25:43.040
He knows who I am,

25:43.042 --> 25:45.109
which means
he knows where I work,
he knows we're sisters,

25:45.111 --> 25:46.043
about Eliza.

25:46.045 --> 25:49.613
Nowhere,
no one is safe anymore.

25:49.615 --> 25:52.283
I warned you!
I told you he was dangerous.

25:54.387 --> 25:55.719
Where's bizarro?

25:57.657 --> 26:00.724
Things didn't go
quite according to plan.

26:01.427 --> 26:02.993
Meaning?

26:02.995 --> 26:04.795
Bizarro is equal
in strength to Kara,

26:04.797 --> 26:06.931
but her powers
are directly oppositional.

26:06.933 --> 26:08.799
We hit her with
the kryptonite dart,

26:08.801 --> 26:10.434
but instead of
weakening her...

26:10.436 --> 26:12.102
It made her stronger.

26:12.104 --> 26:13.837
Yeah.

26:13.839 --> 26:16.774
So, once again
a super-powered monster
is unleashed on national city.

26:16.776 --> 26:19.276
And this one's controlled
by Maxwell lord.

26:19.278 --> 26:21.979
Whoever's behind this,
we have to neutralize
the threat.

26:21.981 --> 26:23.781
You say she's diametrically
opposed to Kara?

26:23.783 --> 26:27.017
Fire breath, freeze-vision,
it's like she's
a mirror image.

26:27.019 --> 26:29.219
In that case,
I'll have the labs
start reverse engineering

26:29.221 --> 26:31.922
the chemical compound
to our synthetic kryptonite.

26:31.924 --> 26:34.325
If its atomic structure is
making bizarro stronger,

26:34.327 --> 26:37.828
reversing its ionic charge
should have
an oppositional effect.

26:41.667 --> 26:43.601
Anything else
you'd like to share?

26:43.936 --> 26:45.069
No, sir.

26:51.344 --> 26:54.111
No plan is going to work
until we take out Max lord.

26:54.113 --> 26:56.013
How do you suggest
we do that?

26:58.217 --> 27:00.851
All I know is that there are
so many threats out there.

27:00.853 --> 27:03.153
Bizarro, non and astra,

27:03.155 --> 27:05.322
and those are just
the ones we know about.

27:05.324 --> 27:08.125
I can't face all of that,
and Maxwell lord too.

27:08.127 --> 27:11.095
It is time to stop him
once and for all.

27:15.568 --> 27:16.967
(Sighs) I should've done more.

27:16.969 --> 27:18.736
I mean, why take her
and not me?

27:18.738 --> 27:20.871
It was just dumb luck.

27:20.873 --> 27:24.308
Cat: Kara, we have been
worried sick about you.

27:24.310 --> 27:25.943
I ordered an Amber alert.

27:25.945 --> 27:29.647
Ms. Grant, could I please
have a minute alone with Adam?

27:31.017 --> 27:32.383
Oh.

27:32.385 --> 27:36.420
Well, I guess I'll go roam
the hallways of my building.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.861
-Adam...
-Are you breaking up with me?

27:44.997 --> 27:47.398
Because we haven't
even started dating yet.

27:49.602 --> 27:51.769
I hate to say this but

27:51.771 --> 27:53.837
maybe the universe
is sending us a message.

27:53.839 --> 27:55.439
Our first date
got interrupted,

27:55.441 --> 27:57.875
and then I was kidnapped.

27:57.877 --> 27:59.677
I know what
you've been through,

27:59.679 --> 28:01.178
and I get it.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.946
But not everyone
is going to leave you.

28:02.948 --> 28:05.282
Not if you let
them stick around.

28:05.284 --> 28:08.419
If I had been
five minutes earlier or later
at noonan's that day,

28:08.421 --> 28:10.487
we wouldn't have even met,
we wouldn't be here.

28:10.489 --> 28:13.390
Okay,
so what I think was fate,
you think is an accident?

28:14.894 --> 28:18.295
If I have learned anything
from the past few weeks,

28:21.233 --> 28:24.034
if I don't have
room in my life
for a great guy like you,

28:24.036 --> 28:26.136
maybe I don't
have room for anyone.

28:26.138 --> 28:29.239
I don't know if that
makes you feel any better.

28:29.241 --> 28:30.307
Not really.

28:31.677 --> 28:32.976
I thought this wasn't
going to work

28:32.978 --> 28:35.412
because of my baggage.

28:36.148 --> 28:37.815
My issues.

28:37.817 --> 28:39.950
That I'd be the one
to chicken out.

28:39.952 --> 28:43.187
-I'm sorry.
-I know you are.

28:45.658 --> 28:47.124
I'm gonna go.

28:47.126 --> 28:50.060
No, I'm gonna leave,
just hang here for a second.

28:59.371 --> 29:00.804
Goodbye, Kara.

29:01.841 --> 29:03.107
Goodbye, Adam.

29:13.486 --> 29:15.886
Supergirl made you a monster.

29:20.493 --> 29:24.328
If I were you,
I'd be very angry about that.

29:24.330 --> 29:27.498
I'd want to take away
anyone Supergirl loves.

29:38.577 --> 29:39.977
(Door slams shut)

29:47.052 --> 29:50.187
Hey, Kara, you okay?

29:50.189 --> 29:53.724
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
I just needed some air.

29:53.726 --> 29:55.092
Yeah.

29:57.296 --> 29:58.462
What happened?

29:59.598 --> 30:04.134
Just... Adam and I...

30:04.136 --> 30:07.404
-Oh, no. Did he...
-No, no, it was me, I did.

30:09.008 --> 30:11.008
(James sighs)

30:11.010 --> 30:13.844
Okay, well, if you need
somebody to talk to...

30:13.846 --> 30:17.347
I think you and I both know
that nothing you can say or do

30:17.349 --> 30:18.749
will make me
feel better right now.

30:18.751 --> 30:20.050
So maybe...

30:22.087 --> 30:24.955
I don't know. Maybe you
should just leave me alone.

30:32.898 --> 30:34.464
Agent danvers,

30:34.466 --> 30:36.633
or whatever you
feel like calling yourself,

30:36.635 --> 30:39.670
I'm growing very tired
of these unannounced visits.

30:39.672 --> 30:42.606
Well, lucky you,
because this is the last one.

30:46.512 --> 30:47.744
What the hell is going on?

30:47.746 --> 30:49.713
Maxwell lord,
you're under arrest.

30:49.715 --> 30:51.415
On what charges, hmm?

30:51.417 --> 30:53.483
Aren't you going
to read me my rights?

30:53.485 --> 30:56.954
I'm acting on behalf
of an extra-legal
enforcement organization.

30:56.956 --> 31:00.057
Meaning you
don't have any rights.

31:00.059 --> 31:01.925
Unless you want
to tell me where bizarro is.

31:01.927 --> 31:04.194
Mmm, not really.

31:04.196 --> 31:06.897
But I do have some information
you might find interesting.

31:06.899 --> 31:11.535
Your sister,
sweet-faced, mild-mannered
ingenue Kara danvers...

31:11.537 --> 31:12.836
You take me in,

31:12.838 --> 31:16.673
I tell the whole world
she's Supergirl.

31:16.675 --> 31:18.141
What do you think about that?

31:19.879 --> 31:21.111
Where you're going,

31:21.113 --> 31:23.080
there won't be
anyone to hear you.

31:26.585 --> 31:27.684
(Whooshing)

31:27.686 --> 31:29.253
Kara, I...

31:30.956 --> 31:32.522
What the hell?

31:32.524 --> 31:34.057
(Screams)

31:47.706 --> 31:49.473
Maxwell: So this is the deo.

31:49.475 --> 31:51.842
A little more stalagmite-chic
than I pictured.

31:51.844 --> 31:53.644
Take him to cell 19.

31:53.646 --> 31:55.078
My lucky number.

31:57.650 --> 31:59.583
What the hell do you think
you're doing, Alex?

31:59.585 --> 32:01.485
I had no choice, Hank.

32:01.487 --> 32:02.953
He's had us
under surveillance.

32:02.955 --> 32:05.022
He knows about the deo.
He knows about Kara.

32:05.024 --> 32:07.658
I don't care if he's got
the nuclear codes and
his finger's on the button,

32:07.660 --> 32:09.559
that is not some anonymous
alien you brought in.

32:09.561 --> 32:10.727
That is Maxwell lord,

32:10.729 --> 32:13.163
head of a multibillion
dollar organization.

32:13.165 --> 32:15.332
<i> Time</i> magazine's reigning
person of the year.

32:15.334 --> 32:17.134
Everyone is going
to be looking for this guy.

32:17.136 --> 32:18.902
They won't find him.

32:18.904 --> 32:22.539
You're compromising
the security of this
entire operation.

32:22.541 --> 32:25.876
And he is compromising
the security of my family.

32:25.878 --> 32:28.011
Guess which one
i care about more?

32:28.013 --> 32:29.713
We are all willing
to do a lot of things

32:29.715 --> 32:31.715
to protect our secrets, Hank.

32:31.717 --> 32:33.517
I would think you
would understand that

32:33.519 --> 32:34.584
better than anyone.

32:47.499 --> 32:49.099
(Gasps)

33:03.449 --> 33:04.514
No move.

33:05.284 --> 33:06.383
Okay.

33:07.686 --> 33:09.486
I won't move.

33:09.488 --> 33:10.687
I won't move.

33:14.159 --> 33:15.926
Why did you bring me here?

33:15.928 --> 33:17.761
Supergirl loves you.

33:19.164 --> 33:20.597
How do you know that?

33:20.599 --> 33:22.199
Supergirl and me.

33:22.601 --> 33:23.667
Same.

33:27.840 --> 33:30.040
Why don't you come closer,
so I can see you?

33:30.042 --> 33:31.308
Bizarro: No.

33:31.810 --> 33:33.143
Why not?

33:34.580 --> 33:36.046
Ugly.

33:38.550 --> 33:40.350
You know, we...

33:40.352 --> 33:43.387
We all feel ugly sometimes.

33:43.389 --> 33:47.257
We all feel like
no one loves us.

33:48.727 --> 33:50.527
Like maybe they never will.

33:51.497 --> 33:53.897
And you may not
look like her right now,

33:53.899 --> 33:57.534
but there is a part of you
that still is Supergirl.

34:00.239 --> 34:03.140
I can feel it.

34:03.142 --> 34:08.111
And people don't love her
because of what she looks
like on the outside.

34:10.716 --> 34:12.082
I love her

34:14.653 --> 34:16.520
because of who she is.

34:17.990 --> 34:20.157
Because she's brave,

34:20.993 --> 34:23.226
because she's kind,

34:23.228 --> 34:26.163
and she always tries
to do the right thing.

34:29.735 --> 34:31.535
And you can be the same.

34:36.408 --> 34:38.108
You're not a monster.

34:47.386 --> 34:48.452
Liar!

34:51.023 --> 34:52.289
(James screaming)

34:54.493 --> 34:55.959
(James groaning)

34:55.961 --> 34:57.861
It's James. Bizarro has him.

34:57.863 --> 34:59.329
The compound is ready.

34:59.331 --> 35:00.897
The exact molecular opposite
to green kryptonite.

35:00.899 --> 35:02.933
You move her into position,
I'll take the shot.

35:02.935 --> 35:05.035
Will this stuff work?

35:05.037 --> 35:06.436
We're gonna find out.

35:13.178 --> 35:15.312
I kill Supergirl.

35:29.228 --> 35:30.594
(Both grunting)

35:35.100 --> 35:36.600
(Glass shattering)

36:10.235 --> 36:11.735
(Choking)

36:21.446 --> 36:22.946
(Bizarro growling)

36:28.153 --> 36:29.719
I can't get a clean shot.

36:29.721 --> 36:30.787
Just do it!

36:34.493 --> 36:36.760
Kara, I don't know
what this is going to do
to you if I hit you.

36:36.762 --> 36:38.261
(Choking) Take the shot!

36:42.100 --> 36:43.366
(Bizarro grunts)

36:46.305 --> 36:47.837
(Panting)

36:53.345 --> 36:54.878
(Exhales)

37:06.625 --> 37:08.692
Hank henshaw:
She's been asking for you.

37:09.428 --> 37:11.428
(Weakly) Supergirl.

37:11.430 --> 37:12.929
Hi. I'm here. Hi.

37:13.966 --> 37:16.666
I'm sorry.

37:17.836 --> 37:20.737
I know. I'm sorry, too.

37:24.543 --> 37:25.909
Hank henshaw:
We're going to put her under,

37:25.911 --> 37:28.445
the way she was
when I first saw her.

37:28.447 --> 37:30.847
She won't feel
any pain, will she?

37:30.849 --> 37:32.949
She won't feel anything.

37:32.951 --> 37:34.251
We have to try to help her.

37:34.253 --> 37:35.585
We will.

37:39.224 --> 37:42.459
I'm going to hold your hand
until you fall asleep, okay?

37:43.795 --> 37:44.861
Afraid.

37:46.665 --> 37:47.731
I know.

37:49.468 --> 37:52.335
I once went to sleep
for a long time, too.

37:52.337 --> 37:53.803
I was afraid.

37:59.878 --> 38:01.011
But when I woke up,

38:01.880 --> 38:03.313
I wasn't alone.

38:04.182 --> 38:05.982
You're not gonna
be alone either.

38:08.687 --> 38:10.754
Thank you,

38:12.257 --> 38:13.523
Kara.

38:19.931 --> 38:20.997
(Gulps)

38:30.409 --> 38:32.842
She didn't deserve
what happened to her.

38:32.844 --> 38:35.378
No, she did not.

38:37.082 --> 38:40.016
Maxwell lord made her
to be just like me.

38:41.953 --> 38:43.019
And she was.

38:55.500 --> 38:57.667
Guess my girl
came in second place.

38:57.669 --> 39:02.339
We'll see how funny you
think it is when you've been
in that cell for a few years.

39:04.076 --> 39:06.543
I'd say you're different from
your cousin when it comes to

39:06.545 --> 39:09.846
truth, justice
and the American way,

39:09.848 --> 39:13.550
but holding
people indefinitely
against their will,

39:13.552 --> 39:15.685
can't get much
more American than that.

39:17.422 --> 39:21.424
You will never hurt
anyone ever again.

39:22.694 --> 39:25.829
Anyone like Eliza danvers?

39:27.733 --> 39:30.700
That's some cute house
you grew up in in midvale.

39:31.503 --> 39:33.169
Right along the beach.

39:33.171 --> 39:34.471
Idyllic.

39:38.443 --> 39:39.943
He's not worth it.

39:41.046 --> 39:43.446
Agent danvers, my hero.

39:46.518 --> 39:48.418
So long, sisters.

39:49.254 --> 39:50.720
See you soon.

40:03.635 --> 40:05.568
-Ms. Grant?
-Mmm.

40:07.606 --> 40:10.039
Uh, I don't know
if you've talked to Adam...

40:10.041 --> 40:11.141
I did.

40:12.010 --> 40:13.476
He's leaving.

40:13.478 --> 40:15.578
He's going back to opal city.

40:16.415 --> 40:18.047
So soon?

40:18.049 --> 40:20.784
Well, he says that
now that we're back
into each other's lives,

40:20.786 --> 40:22.419
he'll visit me of course,

40:22.421 --> 40:25.155
but there's nothing
urgent keeping him here
in national city.

40:25.157 --> 40:29.292
You know, Kara,
i always thought that
you and I were very different.

40:29.294 --> 40:34.831
But I'm starting
to realize we may be
more alike than I thought.

40:34.833 --> 40:36.599
In what way?

40:36.601 --> 40:38.201
I lost Adam years ago

40:38.203 --> 40:41.504
because I prioritized
other things over him.

40:41.506 --> 40:42.772
Namely, myself.

40:42.774 --> 40:44.841
And while that may help
you build an empire,

40:44.843 --> 40:46.609
it doesn't help you
build a life.

40:46.611 --> 40:49.279
For that, you need
to put other people first.

40:49.281 --> 40:52.382
I thought you understood that
but I guess I was wrong.

40:52.384 --> 40:54.684
Ms. Grant,
i want to explain why...

40:54.686 --> 40:57.020
Why you broke my son's heart?

40:57.022 --> 41:02.158
No, whatever happened
between you and Adam, Kara,
is your own personal business.

41:02.160 --> 41:04.127
I just want you
to know that it wasn't...

41:04.129 --> 41:05.829
Cat: I don't want to know.

41:05.831 --> 41:07.564
In fact, from this moment on,

41:07.566 --> 41:10.099
I think our
relationship should be
strictly professional.

41:10.101 --> 41:12.101
Boss, employee.

41:12.103 --> 41:13.937
That way,
everything is very clear.

41:13.939 --> 41:17.507
Nobody gets confused.
Nobody gets hurt.

41:18.610 --> 41:21.978
Of course.
If that's what you want.

41:33.191 --> 41:35.558
Hey. Perfect timing.

41:35.560 --> 41:38.328
Do you want to go to
noonan's for happy hour?

41:38.330 --> 41:39.662
We still haven't
de-briefed about

41:39.664 --> 41:41.631
what happened when
you were with bizarro.

41:41.633 --> 41:43.199
I mean,
it's nothing earth-shattering.

41:43.201 --> 41:45.869
I just said how I was feeling
until you got there.

41:45.871 --> 41:47.737
Oh, okay, well,
then no work talk,

41:47.739 --> 41:49.572
and we can just have
free buffalo wings.

41:49.574 --> 41:52.809
Yeah, I'd love to,
i just have to pick up
Lucy from the airport.

41:52.811 --> 41:56.279
She was in D.C.
visiting her father.

41:56.281 --> 41:58.781
-Happy reunion.
-Happy reunion.

41:59.985 --> 42:01.050
Night.

42:03.321 --> 42:04.988
Hey, uh, Kara...

42:08.326 --> 42:09.726
Have a good night.

42:16.801 --> 42:17.867
(Sighs)

42:30.615 --> 42:32.181
(Skittering on wall)

43:03.448 --> 43:05.048
What the hell?

43:12.157 --> 43:13.222
(Gasps)
