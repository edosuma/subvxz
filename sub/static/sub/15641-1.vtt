00:05.964 --> 00:08.308
<i>Adrenaline. Money.</i>

00:09.384 --> 00:12.228
<i>Sex. Power.</i>

00:13.305 --> 00:17.105
<i>On this court, you can have it all.</i>

00:17.267 --> 00:23.570
<i>When you dance here, the feeling is
indescribable and addictive.</i>

00:23.732 --> 00:25.700
<i>Winning a spot on this floor
is hard.</i>

00:25.859 --> 00:29.159
<i>Keeping it, well,
that's a whole lot harder.</i>

00:29.321 --> 00:32.575
<i>One wrong move
and you can lose it all.</i>

00:32.698 --> 00:34.793
<i>Some girls learn that the hard way</i>

00:34.952 --> 00:36.920
<i>and those girls,
they have to bounce.</i>

01:14.992 --> 01:19.998
Easy on the lipstick, Ahsha. You're
interviewing at a bank, not a brothel.

01:20.163 --> 01:25.010
- So, ixnay on the fishnets?
- Look at you.

01:26.420 --> 01:29.594
Heading out into the world,
looking like a boss.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.678
For where I was when I had you,

01:33.844 --> 01:35.812
you could have turned out
a whole lot different.

01:35.971 --> 01:37.598
Mom, you act like
you were sleeping

01:37.764 --> 01:39.482
on a dirty mattress
in a crack den.

01:39.641 --> 01:42.235
You were an original Devil Girl.

01:42.394 --> 01:44.396
Coolest first job ever.

01:44.563 --> 01:48.238
Too bad you bailed before I could
see you shake that thing.

01:48.400 --> 01:51.745
Professional basketball
was no place for children.

01:51.862 --> 01:54.866
It was barely a place
for grown women.

01:55.032 --> 01:57.330
Hey. Now I got you this interview,

01:57.492 --> 02:00.746
if you're late, so help me, Jesus,
I'll beat that little ass.

02:03.540 --> 02:06.214
That's German. Okay.

02:11.298 --> 02:15.474
- Hey. You got this.
- Thanks, Mom!

02:23.185 --> 02:27.156
Wow. You look interviewy.

02:27.314 --> 02:29.942
I look like a black Nancy Grace.

02:30.108 --> 02:32.110
Okay, so where to, Nancy?

02:35.822 --> 02:38.541
- Babe, you're doing it?
- I don't know.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.668
I don't know! I don't know!

02:40.827 --> 02:44.252
The first day of the rest of my life
could be my last if my mother found out.

02:44.414 --> 02:47.918
But I've wanted this since...

02:48.085 --> 02:51.885
I don't remember not wanting this.
Babe, tell me what to do.

02:52.047 --> 02:53.640
You know the captain
of the basketball team

02:53.799 --> 02:56.928
that you cheered to Division Champs
wants you to go for it.

02:57.094 --> 03:02.191
Being a Devil Girl would be, be, be
the bomb! Put your pom-poms up!

03:02.349 --> 03:04.727
What does the high school
gym teacher want me to do?

03:04.893 --> 03:08.238
Well, I'm sure he wouldn't mind
seeing you in that little outfit too.

03:08.397 --> 03:11.697
But you know it's not my decision
any more than it's your mom's.

03:21.660 --> 03:23.333
And five, six, seven, eight!

03:41.555 --> 03:44.354
People, people,
these are simple steps.

03:44.516 --> 03:47.736
Okay, who wasn't keeping up?
Let's make our first cuts.

03:50.397 --> 03:53.446
Sorry. No.

04:07.164 --> 04:11.135
Okay girls! Again!
Let's get it better.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.943
As the premier dance team
for professional basketball,

04:29.060 --> 04:31.483
Devil Girls are celebrities
in their own right,

04:31.646 --> 04:33.990
tantalising fans in the nosebleeds

04:34.149 --> 04:36.368
down to the movie stars,
recording artists

04:36.526 --> 04:40.781
and politicians in the front row
and nobody tantalises more

04:40.906 --> 04:43.284
than Devil Girl's captain
Jelena Howard.

04:43.450 --> 04:46.875
- Jelena, what is your role here today?
- I'm here as a cheerleader for them.

04:47.037 --> 04:50.166
I live and die for the Devil Girls
and I'm just here to lend

04:50.332 --> 04:53.461
all of these incredible women
my love and support.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.880
Wow. She's good.

05:00.342 --> 05:01.685
Go, Devils!

05:03.678 --> 05:06.522
I hope it was worth it.

05:06.681 --> 05:09.651
- What was worth it?
- Being gone all day.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.812
It takes less effort
to rob a bank.

05:13.438 --> 05:15.190
Did you get it?

05:15.357 --> 05:17.655
There were a lot of people
interviewing today.

05:17.818 --> 05:21.789
<i>- I'll</i> just call Maxine.
- No, I'm an adult.

05:21.947 --> 05:25.702
- I need to take it from here.
- You're right. You are right.

05:26.660 --> 05:30.210
Dinner's almost ready, go get
cleaned up and tell me all about it.

05:48.139 --> 05:50.358
Do I have time to take a show...

05:53.228 --> 05:56.653
- I can explain.
- Am I having a stroke?

05:56.815 --> 05:59.443
Mom, working at a bank
isn't my dream.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.987
It's no one's dream, Ahsha,
it's what you do.

06:02.153 --> 06:04.372
-It's what people do!
-It's not what you did!

06:04.531 --> 06:05.908
<i>"Nu
{Worm</i>

06:06.074 --> 06:08.668
Did you think I was joking when
I said I was lucky to get out of there?

06:08.785 --> 06:11.208
- That is a wild world, Ahsha.
- Oh, and I'm just a little girl!

06:11.371 --> 06:14.045
We worked so hard
to get you through school!

06:14.207 --> 06:16.585
You got to dance
in front of 20,000 people.

06:16.751 --> 06:20.381
You got to live your dream!
This was my shot. I took it.

06:20.505 --> 06:22.052
Ahsha.

06:27.137 --> 06:30.892
Look, you can relax. There were like
100 other girls there by the end.

06:32.684 --> 06:35.028
You made it to the end?

06:35.145 --> 06:37.193
They're not going
to call me back.

06:39.357 --> 06:41.780
Ahsha, while you were in
the other room your phone rang.

06:41.902 --> 06:44.121
It was probably German.

07:06.468 --> 07:08.812
They picked 30 girls
to come back tomorrow.

07:11.181 --> 07:12.683
I'm one of them.

07:16.269 --> 07:19.443
Well, I guess if this is your shot,
you'd better take it.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.028
This is insane!
What should I do?

07:21.191 --> 07:23.990
- How should I dress?
- For war.

07:24.152 --> 07:26.655
Final stage of tryouts
is against the current squad.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.407
What are you talking about?

07:28.573 --> 07:31.952
Devil Girls have to re-audition every
year. They'll be there tomorrow.

07:32.118 --> 07:35.793
There's 14 spots. They're not
giving up theirs without a fight.

07:48.843 --> 07:50.436
Pete.

07:50.595 --> 07:53.519
Hey, the entrance
to the gym is this way.

07:53.682 --> 07:56.481
- There's no point in my being there.
- Oh, come, on.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.486
Yourjudging finals is
brilliant PR.

07:58.645 --> 08:01.194
You're a former all-star coming back
to coach your old team.

08:01.356 --> 08:04.326
- This is awesome promotion for you.
- They're not promoting me.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.613
They're not even promoting basketball.
This is about the dancers,

08:07.779 --> 08:09.702
who have gotten completely
out of control, by the way.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.416
They've become mass-marketed
blow-up dolls

08:11.574 --> 08:14.293
and it's just a distraction to the game,
to my players, to everything.

08:14.452 --> 08:16.375
They have bigger fan bases
than some of your starters.

08:16.538 --> 08:19.257
I took this job because I care
about the game of basketball.

08:19.416 --> 08:24.263
No, no. You took this because your wife
is bleeding you dry in the divorce.

08:24.421 --> 08:26.094
Now, come on.

08:26.256 --> 08:28.600
The quicker you're in
the quicker you're out.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.601
I don't know anything
about dancing.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.933
I didn't even dance
at my own wedding.

08:33.096 --> 08:35.815
Well, look what I got you.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.287
Mia's gone? When?

08:53.450 --> 08:56.374
Last night, she took off
like Toni Braxton from the IRS.

08:56.536 --> 09:00.837
Ladies, come here please.
Today is your solos.

09:00.999 --> 09:03.718
This is your chance to show us
who you really are.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.424
I'm also thrilled to announce

09:05.587 --> 09:07.840
that we have an addition
to our judges' table for the finals,

09:08.006 --> 09:10.429
so please, help me welcome

09:10.592 --> 09:13.641
former Devil and brand-new
Devil's head coach,

09:13.803 --> 09:16.773
Pete Davenport!

09:23.188 --> 09:25.941
I don't know anything about dancing,

09:26.066 --> 09:28.660
so I'll make you guys a deal.
I won't waste your time

09:28.818 --> 09:31.367
-if you don't waste mine.
- I am so sorry.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.577
My boyfriend's car broke down
on the 405.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.708
Not really broke down,
more like exploded.

09:35.825 --> 09:38.954
- I left them there and took a taxi--
- I'm sorry, who are you?

09:39.120 --> 09:41.043
Ahsha, Ahsha Hayes.

09:41.206 --> 09:45.256
Okay, well, Ahsha, Ahsha Hayes, if
I have to be here at 6:30 am, so do you.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.420
Of course.
I totally understand professionalism.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.464
Trust me, I was Captain
of my cheerleading squad in college.

09:49.631 --> 09:51.133
That's great. Okay?
Thank you for coming.

09:51.299 --> 09:53.552
- Thank you for coming?
- There's the door.

09:55.887 --> 09:59.687
Listen. She... She's the daughter
of an original Devil Girl.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.897
- Nepotism?
- Loyalty.

10:02.060 --> 10:04.062
What do you think would happen
if one of my players strolled in

10:04.229 --> 10:06.607
-late after game time?
- Can I just...?

10:07.941 --> 10:10.035
You have every right
to kick me out.

10:10.193 --> 10:14.243
It's just, my whole life,
I never dreamed of being a dancer,

10:14.405 --> 10:17.124
I dreamed of being a Devil Girl,

10:17.283 --> 10:19.786
to have the entire
Devil stadium on its feet.

10:19.953 --> 10:23.332
Being here,
it's all I've ever wanted.

10:25.208 --> 10:29.133
If you could just give me
one more chance I... Please.

10:29.295 --> 10:33.095
- I think you made your point.
- Whatever, your show.

10:33.258 --> 10:38.014
Second chance. One slip up
on your solo and you're out.

10:38.179 --> 10:40.102
Okay. Thank you. Thank you.

10:41.432 --> 10:43.935
Desiree, you're up.

11:22.557 --> 11:26.152
You're Jelena Howard.
I love you. Not in a lesbian way.

11:26.311 --> 11:28.530
But if you asked me to make out
with you, I totally would.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.065
That was a joke.

11:30.231 --> 11:33.405
Oh, my God, say something
that's not embarrassing.

11:33.568 --> 11:37.573
When I was captain of my cheerleading
squad, I used to pretend I was you.

11:37.739 --> 11:39.537
That's cute.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.542
You think you can come in here

11:41.659 --> 11:45.505
with your college cheerleader shtick
and your "I have a dream" speech

11:45.622 --> 11:49.547
and your busted choreography
and take one of our spots...

11:50.460 --> 11:52.679
Your mommy may have scored you
a second chance,

11:52.837 --> 11:55.215
but it's only so long
before even you realise

11:55.340 --> 11:57.684
that you don't have what it takes.

11:57.842 --> 11:59.890
Devil Girls don't need to beg.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.147
They don't sob in the bathroom.

12:02.263 --> 12:04.265
And they don't play pretend.

12:14.275 --> 12:16.824
Don't let Jelena get to you.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.613
Her bark worse than her bite?

12:18.780 --> 12:21.579
No, her bite is worse.
She's just trying to push you.

12:21.699 --> 12:24.953
- To do my best or to slit my wrists?
- Either way, win, win.

12:25.119 --> 12:27.872
I'm shaking. I'm literally shaking.

12:28.039 --> 12:30.713
Try doing this with
a four-year-old son at home.

12:30.875 --> 12:33.594
I love kids. I bet he's cute.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.302
And expensive, with a deadbeat daddy.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.424
I'll babysit him if you babysit me.

12:38.591 --> 12:42.312
- Jelena is one scary mother effer.
- Deal.

12:47.976 --> 12:51.071
- Well, hello ladies.
- Hey.

13:00.196 --> 13:03.370
So, which one of you boys
wants to help stretch me out?

13:03.533 --> 13:05.877
Nobody's gonna be stretching anybody.

13:06.035 --> 13:09.005
My boys are not on the menu
and vice versa.

13:09.163 --> 13:11.336
<i>NOW, come ORG, move, MOVE, move.</i>

13:11.499 --> 13:13.843
You don't ever let us have no fun.

13:18.172 --> 13:21.142
- Jesus.
- Looking good, Raquel.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.429
I have to get back inside.
They could call me any minute.

13:23.594 --> 13:26.689
Yeah, Miguel had a smart mouth with
my girlfriend last time I had him.

13:26.848 --> 13:29.101
Whatever you told him about her,
fix it.

13:29.267 --> 13:33.147
You'd be amazed at the hours and hours
we spend not talking about you.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.940
Maybe that's the problem.

13:35.064 --> 13:38.864
- He has no respect, no fear.
- He shouldn't fear you. He's four!

13:39.027 --> 13:42.702
You're screwing up, but I have got
something that'll chill you out.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.995
A vacation.

13:46.326 --> 13:49.375
This is from a lawyer.
You're suing me?

13:49.537 --> 13:52.461
This visitation BS
ain't working for me.

13:52.582 --> 13:55.756
- He needs a man in his life full-time.
- So find me one!

13:55.918 --> 14:00.424
Raquel? I thought we could work
on some of our routines.

14:00.590 --> 14:02.718
- Sure.
- I want him ready at 7:00 am,

14:02.884 --> 14:04.682
not a minute later.

14:06.220 --> 14:08.973
Go ahead.

14:10.391 --> 14:12.860
Miguel's father.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.364
What kind of deadbeat dad
drives a Porsche?

14:17.523 --> 14:21.073
The kind that manages
half the players on this team.

14:21.235 --> 14:24.739
Listen up.
We're seeing a lot of technique here.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.162
We're not seeing
nearly enough performance.

14:27.325 --> 14:30.454
We need face. We need this.

15:17.333 --> 15:20.086
Ahsha? You're up next.

15:21.504 --> 15:23.757
Break a leg.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.795
We're now going to split you up
into groups of four.

16:02.962 --> 16:06.341
If you're not in a group, good fight
and we'll see you next year.

16:06.507 --> 16:08.555
Names are on the clipboard.

16:15.558 --> 16:17.981
"Raquel, Ahsha."
Yes, we're in the same group!

16:18.102 --> 16:21.481
Congrats! Today's your lucky day.

16:21.647 --> 16:23.445
You really want to know
what it's like to be a Devil Girl?

16:23.608 --> 16:26.657
Well, in this next round,
I'm going to show you.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.493
Make sure your mommy signs
your permission slip.

16:33.284 --> 16:35.912
That's her, one of the new girls.

16:36.078 --> 16:39.378
So, which one of you has the crush?

16:40.458 --> 16:42.836
We heard rumours and we have to know,

16:43.002 --> 16:46.051
'cause we Devil Girls
don't just let anyone in.

16:46.214 --> 16:51.471
- What rumours?
- That you're an exotic dancer.

16:51.636 --> 16:54.480
Exotic dancer?

16:54.639 --> 16:57.813
Oh, God, no. I'm a stripper.

17:00.895 --> 17:03.193
I'm going to be going around
teaching all the groups the base

17:03.356 --> 17:05.279
to an actual Devil Girls routine.

17:05.441 --> 17:09.820
How you dress it up is up to you, but you
need to get the base down, and you will.

17:09.945 --> 17:13.791
Even if that means
I run you all into the ground.

17:13.950 --> 17:17.545
You look tight, both of you.
You're not getting any extension.

17:17.662 --> 17:19.664
A lap around the stadium
will get you right.

17:19.829 --> 17:22.174
- A lap around the...?
- Stadium.

17:27.380 --> 17:30.680
One, two, three, four
and five six, seven and eight.

17:30.841 --> 17:34.562
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

17:34.720 --> 17:38.395
One, two, three, four
and five, six, seven, eight.

17:38.558 --> 17:46.659
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

17:47.817 --> 17:49.819
You know,
I'm gonna change things up.

17:49.944 --> 17:51.787
Marissa and Kyle
you start out in the back,

17:51.904 --> 17:54.282
but then go back-to-back
and slide to the front.

17:54.448 --> 17:57.372
You've got to use each other for balance,
or you both will fall on your asses.

17:57.535 --> 17:59.663
Can't we go front-to-front?
It's hotter.

17:59.829 --> 18:01.581
I don't know what you do
in the Champagne room,

18:01.747 --> 18:03.169
but this is Devil's stadium.

18:03.332 --> 18:05.460
We're not trying to make tips here,
we're trying to make art.

18:05.626 --> 18:07.799
- Stripping can be an art.
- Yeah.

18:07.962 --> 18:11.557
And I'm sure Andy Warhol
did his best work on some dude's lap.

18:11.716 --> 18:13.764
I'm pretty sure he did, actually.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.394
Look, I'm just trying
to spice this thing up

18:15.553 --> 18:17.931
and so far the only thing I'm bringing
to this routine is a book.

18:18.097 --> 18:21.192
This needs to be killer. I'm done
stripping for car salesmen in Carson

18:21.350 --> 18:23.978
and if I'm gonna get out,
I need to dance for higher-class guys.

18:24.103 --> 18:27.733
And the front row at the Devil's game
is as A-list as it gets.

18:27.898 --> 18:30.742
You're a whore.
You're just here to screw rich guys.

18:30.860 --> 18:32.988
I'm here to dance for rich guys.

18:33.154 --> 18:35.623
So the herpes is extra?

18:35.740 --> 18:37.583
- Really?
"Stop!

18:43.623 --> 18:46.217
Oh God, this is cheap.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.009
- Oh, my God.
- Are you okay?

18:56.802 --> 18:58.304
You've got all those curves
but no brakes, huh?

18:58.471 --> 19:01.224
- Wow. Really?
- Well, I can't help myself.

19:01.390 --> 19:02.858
I see an open chance
to score and I attack.

19:03.017 --> 19:05.019
I hope for your sake,
your game's better on the court.

19:05.144 --> 19:08.899
Oh, okay, okay, that was B game.
That was B game. Let me give you A.

19:09.023 --> 19:11.276
I don't have time for your alphabet.
I have to finish out here

19:11.442 --> 19:12.944
so I can go back inside
and work on my routine.

19:13.110 --> 19:15.204
- Can I watch?
- You a fan of dance?

19:15.363 --> 19:19.288
I'm a fan of a whole,
whole bunch of things.

19:19.450 --> 19:22.329
- You don't stop.
- Most girls like basketball players.

19:22.495 --> 19:25.214
I love them.
Got one of my own, in fact.

19:25.373 --> 19:28.843
You got a boyfriend?
Who does he play for?

19:31.253 --> 19:33.255
Didn't I hear your coach say
something about no messing around

19:33.381 --> 19:35.008
between Devils and Devil Girls?

19:35.174 --> 19:39.270
Are you sure? Because the music
was loud and y'all was dancing.

19:39.428 --> 19:41.430
He could've been saying anything.

19:41.597 --> 19:42.974
Look, technically
you're not a Devil Girl.

19:43.140 --> 19:46.394
I don't think my boyfriend cares
about your technicalities.

19:47.687 --> 19:50.281
Cold shower for me, then.

19:57.488 --> 20:01.664
One and two and three and four,
five, six, shimmy it up.

20:01.784 --> 20:04.537
Prep for your lift;
straighten your legs, Ahsha.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.248
No. Damn it, Ahsha.

20:07.415 --> 20:10.544
Since you can't hold the lift,
your group has to get rid of it.

20:10.710 --> 20:13.213
They'll toss you instead. You'll just
have to twist into the open spot.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.552
- She'll break her neck.
- There's a hole now.

20:15.715 --> 20:18.969
-It's her fault. She needs to fill it.
- Let me try.

20:19.135 --> 20:20.978
-It's settled.
- No, it's not settled.

20:21.137 --> 20:24.391
Raquel, don't you have a kid
of your own to worry about?

20:24.557 --> 20:26.150
- Unbelievable.
- Excuse me?

20:26.308 --> 20:28.982
I am so tired of seeing you
terrorise people, Jelena.

20:29.103 --> 20:31.026
You think you can just push
people around.

20:31.188 --> 20:34.237
You're a bully, you've always been
a bully and I'm sick of it.

20:42.032 --> 20:44.751
Listen, Jelena, I'm sorry.

20:44.910 --> 20:48.164
I think I'm just letting
this Jesse thing get to me and...

20:53.002 --> 20:55.255
I didn't know Terrence Wall
was going to be here today.

20:55.421 --> 20:57.640
There she is.

21:00.885 --> 21:03.889
How can she get away with sleeping
with the players and no one else can?

21:04.054 --> 21:06.148
Different rules for different folk.

21:06.307 --> 21:07.934
You risked a lot standing up
for me today.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.273
Nah. It'll be fine.

21:12.521 --> 21:14.944
- Peter.
- Oscar.

21:15.107 --> 21:18.236
Come on, Pete.
Lighten up, for Christ's sake.

21:18.402 --> 21:21.827
Look at all the ass
I set you up with today.

21:21.989 --> 21:26.085
- Is that why you had me do this?
- Just rolling out the red carpet.

21:26.243 --> 21:29.838
Well, with some of these girls it's more
hardwood, if you know what I mean.

21:29.997 --> 21:33.251
- I mean, they wax their...
- Yeah, I got it. Oscar, thank you.

21:35.377 --> 21:39.098
Georgia, do me a favour.
Pull that one out.

21:39.256 --> 21:41.304
She looks like Mickey Rourke.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.770
Emmy, sorry, you're cut.

21:47.723 --> 21:50.897
- I like that one.
- Yeah. I wonder why.

21:51.894 --> 21:56.195
You know what, Pete?
Your wife's not coming back.

21:56.357 --> 22:00.282
Time for you to go
for the rebound, my friend.

22:00.444 --> 22:02.663
When I say your name,
please step forward.

22:02.780 --> 22:04.782
Monica.

22:06.492 --> 22:08.290
Billie.

22:08.452 --> 22:10.295
Marissa.

22:11.997 --> 22:14.546
Lakeisha.

22:14.708 --> 22:16.710
Kyle.

22:20.256 --> 22:22.133
- Thank you for coming.
- What?

22:22.299 --> 22:24.518
The rest of you can rest up
because tomorrow's the big day.

22:31.183 --> 22:34.232
I don't know what was worse,
the douche bag Devil's coach

22:34.395 --> 22:36.443
who chewed me out the moment
I walked in the door,

22:36.605 --> 22:39.358
or Jelena, the kraken-with-a-weave
squad captain who has it out for me.

22:39.525 --> 22:40.902
Why, I have no idea.

22:41.068 --> 22:44.914
So, wait.
Why was the coach at tryouts?

22:45.072 --> 22:48.076
They made him a judge,
part of some PR blitz.

22:48.242 --> 22:51.872
"Coach Davenport returns to LA,
rah-rah, praise Jesus!"

22:52.037 --> 22:55.917
- Pete Davenport?
- You know him?

22:56.083 --> 22:57.756
I remember girls like Jelena.

22:57.918 --> 23:02.219
If she's targeting you, it's because
she sees you as a threat.

23:05.009 --> 23:07.011
Will you come with me tomorrow?

23:08.512 --> 23:10.264
I can't.

23:10.431 --> 23:13.856
I said years ago
I'd never go back and I meant it.

23:15.477 --> 23:19.823
- You done?
- Yeah. Thanks.

23:22.860 --> 23:26.205
I don't know why she took off
like that and I don't care.

23:26.363 --> 23:28.866
I'll tell you something,
that girl's got a big mouth.

23:29.033 --> 23:34.130
With what she knows, let's just hope
we don't hear from her again.

23:34.288 --> 23:37.462
Well, hold... hold on.

23:40.044 --> 23:41.591
Something I can do for you?

23:42.922 --> 23:45.300
Actually, yeah.

23:45.424 --> 23:48.678
First, there's something
I can do for you.

23:52.556 --> 23:54.934
I'll call you back.

24:05.653 --> 24:09.749
- Let's go to Maui.
- When?

24:09.907 --> 24:13.036
Now. Just hop on my jet and go.

24:15.704 --> 24:18.628
Then we can be smelling
like cocoa butter

24:18.791 --> 24:21.965
and everything your mother
warned you about in six hours.

24:22.127 --> 24:26.974
I can't.
We have one more day of tryouts.

24:27.132 --> 24:30.181
Aren't you already on the team?

24:30.302 --> 24:32.896
It's not about making the team.

24:33.055 --> 24:36.935
It's about making the team I want.
Mia screwed us over by taking off.

24:37.101 --> 24:41.607
Olivia has plenty of girls
to choose from.

24:41.772 --> 24:44.651
Exactly, a lot of dead weight

24:44.817 --> 24:47.445
and I need to make sure
that dead weight gets cut.

24:47.611 --> 24:51.491
I may not be a judge, but that doesn't
mean I can't be the executioner.

24:51.657 --> 24:56.208
Oh, you are one hard-ass bitch.

24:56.370 --> 24:59.544
I am gonna hop in the shower.

25:02.084 --> 25:04.928
Maybe I'll see you in there.

25:05.921 --> 25:08.891
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

25:20.769 --> 25:22.988
Mia Incoming

25:23.105 --> 25:26.951
What did I tell you
about calling me?

25:28.152 --> 25:30.780
I don't care, Mia.

25:30.946 --> 25:34.075
I'm not your shrink.
I'm not your mother.

25:35.034 --> 25:37.753
The point of you getting gone
was staying gone.

25:39.413 --> 25:42.337
Unless you want the alternative.

25:42.499 --> 25:44.297
I didn't think so.

25:45.419 --> 25:48.548
Look, I'm doing you a favour.

25:49.965 --> 25:52.889
Call me again
and I stop being so nice.

26:06.482 --> 26:10.282
In the corner, in the corner. Now, right.
Take it in the corner now.

26:15.449 --> 26:17.451
Coming through?

26:20.412 --> 26:23.461
Excuse me. You know you were cut
yesterday, right?

26:23.582 --> 26:26.051
Oscar said I could come back.

26:28.921 --> 26:32.721
Oscar says... Get lucky!

26:34.468 --> 26:36.891
What are you doing here?
They kicked your ass out.

26:37.054 --> 26:38.897
I came back to give you this.

26:42.976 --> 26:46.321
I'm gonna go as you for Halloween.
That was awesome.

26:46.480 --> 26:49.654
Oh, okay. You got to be tough
or these girls will eat you alive.

26:49.817 --> 26:51.865
You know, the ones that eat at all.

26:51.985 --> 26:53.862
I don't get it.
We're all in this together.

26:54.029 --> 26:57.033
That's the point, right?
Unity, team spirit.

26:57.199 --> 27:00.669
Oh, my God. It's like a unicorn humped
a Care Bear and gave birth to you.

27:00.786 --> 27:03.710
Please don't make me worry about you.
I can't stand all that gushy stuff.

27:03.872 --> 27:05.499
Why would you worry about me?

27:06.792 --> 27:09.636
You have the talent
to be the next Jelena.

27:09.795 --> 27:11.593
That makes you a target.

27:11.755 --> 27:14.759
You have no idea what she'll do to make
sure you're not as good as her.

27:14.925 --> 27:16.268
How do you know?

27:16.385 --> 27:18.763
Look, I may not be
the best dancer here,

27:18.929 --> 27:20.931
but I know how the world works.

27:24.143 --> 27:26.362
You better watch yourself, Care Bear.

27:28.814 --> 27:31.237
Show time, girls.

27:31.400 --> 27:34.745
This is your last chance
to show everyone what you've got.

27:34.862 --> 27:37.866
But this time, you're not gonna be
dancing with each other.

27:38.031 --> 27:41.285
You're gonna be dancing against
each other, old versus new.

27:41.451 --> 27:43.328
When Jelena calls your name
I want you to step out

27:43.495 --> 27:45.168
and I want you to show me
how badly you want this.

27:45.330 --> 27:46.707
I want you to show the girl
you're dancing against

27:46.874 --> 27:49.468
how much more you want this
than she does.

27:49.585 --> 27:55.092
A little bit of advice,
dance like your future depends on it.

27:55.257 --> 27:56.725
Jelena?

27:58.051 --> 28:00.600
Lexi, Kyle.

29:05.535 --> 29:08.038
Jordan! Raquel.

29:17.214 --> 29:20.343
Isn't that the one that has the kid
with Jesse Reed?

29:49.037 --> 29:52.132
Ahsha. Peyton.

30:36.168 --> 30:39.388
Nice, thank you.
Girls, that was fantastic.

30:39.504 --> 30:41.973
Unfortunately you can't all
be Devil Girls,

30:42.132 --> 30:44.305
so the judges and I are going to get
together, we're gonna hash this out.

30:44.468 --> 30:48.473
At noon on the dot,
we will announce our team.

30:48.638 --> 30:51.141
Thank you. Great job.

30:54.144 --> 30:57.114
Raquel and Ahsha, no.

30:58.106 --> 31:00.780
What? Raquel's your friend

31:00.901 --> 31:02.744
and she's going through
some custody thing with Jesse.

31:02.861 --> 31:06.081
And Ahsha... Ahsha was bred for this.

31:06.948 --> 31:09.167
This team is about chemistry.

31:09.326 --> 31:13.126
This team is about fantasy. Raquel
knows how to deliver it and Ahsha,

31:13.288 --> 31:16.212
she has an adorable personality,
she is the whole package, that girl.

31:16.375 --> 31:19.174
Well, I'm just thinking about
what's good for the team.

31:19.336 --> 31:21.134
So should you.

31:23.090 --> 31:27.140
Right, so if we can only
keep one person?

31:39.689 --> 31:41.783
Why are we being brought to
the main court?

31:41.900 --> 31:43.948
Why not just announce
the final team back at the gym?

31:44.111 --> 31:47.411
Why? That's why.

31:55.580 --> 31:57.708
Oh, my God,
what are you guys doing here?

31:57.874 --> 32:01.504
I had to be here for you. Either way.

32:01.670 --> 32:03.968
Thank you, Morn.

32:14.808 --> 32:17.607
You think I was playing
about that little outfit, huh?

32:18.937 --> 32:22.441
- Ahsha!
<i>- I'll</i> be right back.

32:36.371 --> 32:38.544
I was wondering if you'd show up.

32:38.665 --> 32:42.169
- Sloane.
- Olivia.

32:42.335 --> 32:44.303
My gosh, I haven't seen you in years.

32:44.421 --> 32:47.174
Well, I see you all the time
on the TV.

32:48.842 --> 32:51.391
- That could've been you too.
- No.

32:51.553 --> 32:54.682
There's only ever room
for one at the top.

32:54.848 --> 32:57.692
You had what it took. I didn't.

32:58.810 --> 33:02.940
- But I did okay.
- You did.

33:04.733 --> 33:06.986
Your daughter is amazing.

33:08.528 --> 33:12.658
You know, I'm kind of surprised
that you wanted her to do this,

33:12.782 --> 33:14.534
all things considered.

33:15.702 --> 33:17.830
This was all her.

33:17.996 --> 33:23.423
And at this point, the only one
who could stop this is you.

33:27.797 --> 33:29.799
Excuse me.

33:33.970 --> 33:37.190
Ladies, when I say your name,
please step forward.

33:40.393 --> 33:43.272
Peyton and Caitlin.

33:47.359 --> 33:50.158
You guys kicked ass, you're in.

33:50.320 --> 33:52.322
Brenda and Catherine.

33:54.783 --> 33:57.582
Nice try, I'm sorry, not this year.

33:57.702 --> 34:00.706
Romy and Saundy,
see you at rehearsals.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.713
Lexi and Lisa.

34:06.294 --> 34:10.219
- I'm sorry girls, not this year.
- What? Are you serious?

34:14.553 --> 34:16.521
Arelly and Kyle.

34:18.681 --> 34:22.402
You guys are in, yes.
Happy to have you.

34:27.190 --> 34:29.568
Desiree and Allie.

34:29.734 --> 34:33.112
Cathleen and Jordan.
Dominique and Danielle.

34:33.280 --> 34:37.877
Ashley and Anna. We're gonna miss
you guys, I'm sorry, not this year.

34:41.746 --> 34:43.293
Raquel and Ahsha.

34:53.174 --> 34:55.268
Please step forward.

35:05.770 --> 35:08.114
Ahsha...

35:08.273 --> 35:10.526
- Don't be late.
- Oh, my God!

35:10.692 --> 35:12.945
Yes!

35:15.196 --> 35:17.824
I'm sorry, Raquel.

35:20.368 --> 35:22.712
- I'm sorry too, Raquel.
- Don't be.

35:22.871 --> 35:25.465
I'm still getting my babysitter.

35:33.256 --> 35:36.385
What are you waiting for?

35:36.551 --> 35:39.430
Great job, guys, Qreatlbb-

35:39.596 --> 35:41.974
Congratulations, great job.

35:45.977 --> 35:48.605
You asked me to make a choice.
That was not the choice I made.

35:48.772 --> 35:50.945
I thought you'd be happy.

35:52.317 --> 35:56.447
- Ahsha was too good.
- So was Mia.

36:03.953 --> 36:07.253
- I didn't get one.
- Oh, I'm sorry. Here you go, Sweetie.

36:07.415 --> 36:12.967
- Listen, be careful.
- I will.

36:17.425 --> 36:20.099
It's here. It's here.

36:21.596 --> 36:25.646
Now, once you put this on,
it's real hard to take it off.

36:27.310 --> 36:29.312
I'll see you in a bit.

36:37.362 --> 36:39.911
Raquel, right?

36:40.073 --> 36:44.670
Listen, I didn't fight for anyone,
but I fought for you.

36:44.828 --> 36:47.172
Me? Why?

36:47.330 --> 36:50.174
Let's just say
I'm extra sensitive to people

36:50.333 --> 36:53.303
who are doing their best to get by.

36:53.420 --> 36:59.052
And whatever I think of all this,
you deserve better.

37:02.470 --> 37:05.474
- Maybe I'll see you around.
- Yeah.

39:18.898 --> 39:22.027
Who would have pictured you
judging cheerleaders?

39:22.193 --> 39:25.367
Sloane! What are you doing here?

39:25.530 --> 39:29.660
- Ahsha. I'm her mother.
- Okay.

39:29.784 --> 39:33.834
The daughter
of an original Devil Girl.

39:33.997 --> 39:36.375
- Jesus, it's been a long time.
- Yeah.

39:36.541 --> 39:39.465
- You look fantastic.
- You look good.

39:39.627 --> 39:42.005
- Thanks.
- Listen...

39:42.171 --> 39:46.472
I don't have to tell you what goes on
behind the scenes, right?

39:46.634 --> 39:50.264
What can happen between
a Devil Girl and a player?

39:52.765 --> 39:55.939
Now that my Ahsha's on the squad,

39:56.060 --> 40:00.281
I'd just feel a lot better knowing someone
on the inside is looking out for her.

40:00.440 --> 40:04.115
I mean, I can try, but the girls
are not my responsibility.

40:06.863 --> 40:09.537
Wrong.

40:09.699 --> 40:12.043
Ahsha is your responsibility.

40:13.202 --> 40:15.580
She's your daughter.

40:24.380 --> 40:26.223
<i>Next time on Hit the Floor.</i>

40:26.341 --> 40:28.639
Welcome to the Devil Girls.

40:28.801 --> 40:30.724
Out with the old, in with the new.

40:30.887 --> 40:33.891
I've seen plenty of girls chewed up
and spit out by Devil Girls Boot Camp.

40:34.057 --> 40:36.651
I'm a Devil Girl now.
I'll never pay my own rent again.

40:36.809 --> 40:39.938
- I'd really like to help.
- Know where I can find a job?

40:40.063 --> 40:42.236
Whoa hey. Gonna walk by
and not give me a hug?

40:42.398 --> 40:44.400
Looks like you've got
your hands full already.

40:44.567 --> 40:46.661
- Were any of the players there?
- They were around.

40:46.819 --> 40:48.992
- I need to see you now.
- Pete, you owe me.

40:49.155 --> 40:51.578
I won't tell Ahsha
that I am her father, for now.
