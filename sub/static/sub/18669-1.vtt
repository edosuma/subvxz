00:30.644 --> 00:32.761
You know I gotta bring you in.

00:34.448 --> 00:37.298
You're gonna have to kill me first.

00:39.120 --> 00:40.733
Yeah, I know.

00:41.890 --> 00:43.317
Do it.

00:45.493 --> 00:47.504
I can't.

00:48.964 --> 00:50.194
Do it.

01:20.994 --> 01:25.534
<i>Careful how you look at me, now, stranger</i>

01:26.334 --> 01:30.812
<i>You ain't rolled the trail
that I've been on</i>

01:31.773 --> 01:36.812
<i>Until you taste the dirt
and smell the danger</i>

01:37.512 --> 01:41.636
<i>You don't know the hell
that's made me strong</i>

01:42.984 --> 01:47.656
<i>The devil stole my woman down in Tucson</i>

01:48.256 --> 01:54.230
<i>And a biscuit down in Juarez
became my only friend</i>

01:55.430 --> 02:01.202
<i>Spurred my horse before...
cut the noose off</i>

02:01.302 --> 02:05.777
<i>And rode off in the sunset once again</i>

02:06.107 --> 02:08.844
<i>And I ride high</i>

02:08.943 --> 02:11.894
<i>In the saddle</i>

02:11.994 --> 02:16.682
<i>But my heart has hit me
like the setting sun</i>

02:17.918 --> 02:23.458
<i>I never had to run and hide
with my old friend here by my side</i>

02:23.558 --> 02:27.760
<i>But you can't kill a memory with a gun</i>

02:49.917 --> 02:51.985
Oh, crap!

03:00.494 --> 03:02.998
<i>Oh, wake up, little darling</i>

03:03.098 --> 03:05.967
<i>Open them eyes</i>

03:06.067 --> 03:09.489
<i>All those birds out singin' outside</i>

03:11.039 --> 03:13.495
<i>Get up, little darling</i>

03:13.595 --> 03:16.144
<i>Throw on them shoes</i>

03:16.244 --> 03:18.478
How are you, Edward?

03:22.566 --> 03:24.611
Two S's in Mississippi, Amos.

03:24.711 --> 03:28.707
- Mind your own business.
- I'm just trying to help.

03:28.807 --> 03:32.310
- You're late.
- Oh, yeah.

03:32.610 --> 03:34.746
You're looking fine
as cream gravy, Eleanor.

03:34.846 --> 03:37.113
You're looking spiffy yourself, Jesse.

03:39.149 --> 03:42.788
- Had a long night. Overslept.
- You didn't.

03:42.888 --> 03:46.051
Haddie Randolph. She's a real bear-cat.

03:46.591 --> 03:50.362
Haddie Randolph?
Jesse, how in the hell do you do this?

03:50.462 --> 03:53.698
You know, sometimes I wonder myself.

03:53.798 --> 03:55.195
You know what?

03:55.295 --> 03:58.570
You're gonna have a lot more time
to wonder about that, because chief...

03:58.670 --> 04:02.669
he's in a real mood today.
And when he finds you?

04:05.577 --> 04:06.904
Helms!

04:14.351 --> 04:15.553
Helms!

04:15.653 --> 04:19.221
- Amos.
- Jesse.

04:26.530 --> 04:28.731
Close the door behind you.

04:36.907 --> 04:39.878
Please. Have a seat.

04:39.978 --> 04:41.796
Sure.

04:43.748 --> 04:45.683
Why are you here?

04:45.783 --> 04:48.119
Well, you... called me in, remember?

04:48.219 --> 04:51.389
- I'm not in the mood for this.
- So I was a little late.

04:51.489 --> 04:55.427
Work starts at 7:00 a.m. sharp.
Do you have any idea what time it is?

04:55.527 --> 04:58.263
- I understand, sir.
- This is a business, son.

04:58.363 --> 05:02.934
A well-oiled machine. If one cog in the wheel
is not working, then it all falls apart.

05:03.034 --> 05:05.871
Do you see what I'm trying to say to you?

05:06.371 --> 05:08.306
That I'm a cog, sir?

05:08.406 --> 05:12.711
I should've fired your ass long ago,
when I had the chance.

05:13.561 --> 05:16.614
Trouble is, you do a bang-up job.

05:16.714 --> 05:20.986
When you're here. Hence my dilemma.

05:21.086 --> 05:25.796
How to let you go
without being the bad guy.

05:26.424 --> 05:30.028
Or how to let you stay
without appearing weak.

05:30.128 --> 05:34.799
- Come again, sir?
- I have this little pet project of mine.

05:34.899 --> 05:36.968
More of a passion, really.

05:37.068 --> 05:41.805
I stumbled on this about five years ago
when I took over the chief's job.

05:43.874 --> 05:45.710
Arizona, 1892.

05:45.810 --> 05:49.571
Bank robbery gone wrong. Six people dead.

05:50.015 --> 05:55.153
They called it the mid-day massacre.
September 23rd, 1892.

05:55.253 --> 06:00.825
Four men, led by an ill-tempered outlaw
named Levi Hardin, walked into a bank.

06:00.925 --> 06:05.029
In the small boom-town
of Young Country, Arizona.

06:05.129 --> 06:09.100
When the smoke cleared, six people
were dead, including a five-year-old girl.

06:09.200 --> 06:13.869
Traveling photographer happened
to be passing through town that day.

06:15.373 --> 06:17.796
- Frank Sheldon.
- Sheldon?

06:17.896 --> 06:19.980
- The one that started the Gazette.
- That's right.

06:20.080 --> 06:23.248
And what was supposed to be
a series of rudimentary shots

06:23.348 --> 06:25.912
to test a camera he'd invented
ended up capturing

06:26.012 --> 06:30.054
one of the only live bank
robberies ever caught on film.

06:31.072 --> 06:34.576
No, men, stand down! Stand down!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

06:34.676 --> 06:38.363
Don't you... I'll fucking kill her!
Hey, I'll kill her, Duke!

06:38.463 --> 06:41.266
- Hardin, don't you hurt her!
- I know you don't want that.

06:44.002 --> 06:45.637
No!

06:53.897 --> 06:55.660
No!

07:06.543 --> 07:08.377
Come on!

07:16.820 --> 07:18.690
It gained national attention,

07:18.790 --> 07:21.999
what with the vicious nature
of the crime an the...

07:22.099 --> 07:25.463
high-profiled individuals involved.

07:25.563 --> 07:31.470
One in particular, a well-respected
U.S. marshal named Duke Donovan.

07:32.770 --> 07:34.286
That him?

07:37.708 --> 07:40.379
Some say he was the ringleader.

07:41.279 --> 07:44.816
So the man people were supposed
to trust ended up betraying them.

07:44.916 --> 07:46.484
Doesn't end there.

07:46.584 --> 07:50.488
<i>Donovan and Hardin
escaped free and clear that day.</i>

07:50.588 --> 07:53.623
<i>But a posse caught up to them later.</i>

08:07.004 --> 08:09.174
This one's alive.

08:09.674 --> 08:12.310
So Hardin double-crossed Donovan
and took the money.

08:12.410 --> 08:15.930
On the contrary,
it's all right there with Donovan.

08:16.030 --> 08:18.700
Donovan claimed that he
was trying to stop them,

08:18.850 --> 08:22.820
but Hardin was holding a woman
hostage outside of town.

08:22.920 --> 08:26.741
He said he was gonna kill her
if Donovan didn't aid in the robbery.

08:26.841 --> 08:30.561
So Donovan said he went along with it,
until the last second.

08:30.961 --> 08:35.008
- There was no sign of a mysterious woman.
- And Hardin?

08:35.107 --> 08:39.104
Donovan claimed he shot him
in the head before he blacked out.

08:39.604 --> 08:42.039
Never found the body.

08:42.140 --> 08:43.674
Well, what happened next?

08:43.774 --> 08:46.878
I don't know if it was his 20 years
of service to the law,

08:46.978 --> 08:51.802
or the fact that Donovan claimed he never
fired a shot during the robbery, but...

08:51.902 --> 08:54.359
something put doubts
in the minds of the jury.

08:54.619 --> 08:56.854
That's a hangin' offense,

08:56.954 --> 09:00.925
but they sentenced him to life
in the Yuma territorial prison.

09:01.425 --> 09:05.496
He lasted there six weeks before escaping.

09:05.596 --> 09:09.634
He was killed two days later
by a young deputy.

09:09.734 --> 09:12.528
- Sounds like quite a story.
- Oh, it is.

09:12.628 --> 09:15.440
I had to uncover a lot of rocks
to find this much.

09:15.540 --> 09:19.624
- But what do you think?
- I'm not sure.

09:20.077 --> 09:22.780
But I'm gonna let you
help me form that opinion.

09:22.880 --> 09:24.916
- How's that?
- By getting an interview

09:25.016 --> 09:28.252
with the last man alive
who knows what really happened.

09:28.352 --> 09:30.555
His name is Seymour Redfield.

09:31.055 --> 09:34.225
Some people think his real name
is Tom Sullivan.

09:34.325 --> 09:37.128
The young deputy
that killed Donovan that day.

09:38.195 --> 09:42.127
When Sullivan brought Donovan's body
back to town, he disappeared.

09:42.227 --> 09:46.291
- Was never heard from again.
- Why don't you just talk to this man?

09:46.391 --> 09:48.072
Well...

09:48.172 --> 09:51.642
Let's just say we don't see eye to eye
and leave it at that.

09:51.942 --> 09:54.712
Only interview I never got.

09:54.812 --> 09:56.581
What makes you think
he'll wanna talk to me?

09:57.081 --> 10:01.586
Because you have more motivation
than I do. Your job's on the line.

10:01.686 --> 10:03.411
Get the story.

10:05.523 --> 10:07.355
Or...

10:53.169 --> 10:54.937
Hello?

10:58.041 --> 10:59.775
Hello?

11:04.381 --> 11:06.851
Hello? Mr. Redfield?

11:20.730 --> 11:21.905
Jeez.

11:34.611 --> 11:38.113
That's a .45 long Colt.

11:44.955 --> 11:50.294
Its many admirers referred to it
as the peacemaker.

11:50.394 --> 11:53.899
- Mr. Redfield?
- Depends on who's asking.

11:54.899 --> 11:57.301
I'm Jesse Helms, from the Gazette.

11:57.902 --> 12:00.526
I was hoping I could talk to you.

12:03.973 --> 12:07.975
I'd've thought you people'd
take the hint by now.

12:11.348 --> 12:15.853
I didn't mean to intrude, sir.
Knocked on the door, and it fell open.

12:15.953 --> 12:19.206
You know, I could've blown
your goddamn head off.

12:19.306 --> 12:22.374
And I'd've been well within my rights.

12:24.327 --> 12:26.964
But, since I just saved your life,

12:27.064 --> 12:29.884
why don't you have a drink with me?

12:30.101 --> 12:33.338
No thank you, sir. I'm on the clock.

12:33.438 --> 12:36.742
Whose clock? Not my clock.

12:38.042 --> 12:42.103
Well, in that case, a small one, sir.

12:49.119 --> 12:53.658
Why don't you rest your butt?
Make yourself comfortable.

12:53.758 --> 12:55.801
Thank you, sir.

12:58.828 --> 13:01.098
You know, my...

13:01.198 --> 13:04.255
Chief said that you didn't
like to talk too much.

13:04.355 --> 13:08.205
Your chief? You mean Morgan Heinz?

13:08.305 --> 13:13.829
Well, pay no attention to Morgan Heinz.
He's nothing but a damned old blowhard.

13:13.929 --> 13:16.881
Only thing he's interested in...

13:16.981 --> 13:22.134
is a good scandal so as he can sell
more sheets of that rag he puts out.

13:25.489 --> 13:29.894
Heinz said that if I didn't talk to you,
then I'd be out of a job.

13:30.694 --> 13:32.930
Well, that's too bad.

13:33.030 --> 13:38.290
However, I hear the pig farm
down the road is hiring.

13:41.337 --> 13:44.911
You know, sir, I don't wanna waste
any more of your time.

13:46.511 --> 13:48.978
I'll see myself out.

14:00.557 --> 14:03.027
I inherited this gun...

14:03.127 --> 14:06.479
from Duke Donovan the day he died.

14:07.698 --> 14:10.302
Marshal Duke Donovan?

14:11.102 --> 14:13.304
The very one.

14:13.404 --> 14:16.208
Was that the gun he used in the robbery?

14:17.108 --> 14:21.412
Is that why Heinz sent you here?
Talk about Duke Donovan?

14:21.512 --> 14:24.315
Well, yes, sir. It is.

14:24.415 --> 14:26.050
Well...

14:26.150 --> 14:29.754
I suppose if you're looking
for the truth...

14:30.154 --> 14:33.474
that's where it all began.

14:34.058 --> 14:35.426
With Donovan.

14:35.526 --> 14:37.395
<i>By 1892,</i>

14:37.495 --> 14:41.865
<i>some say the legend of Duke Donovan
had begun to eclipse the man.</i>

14:55.278 --> 14:57.181
<i>He never had any children.</i>

14:57.281 --> 15:00.785
<i>On account of their getting married
later in life.</i>

15:00.885 --> 15:04.338
<i>Just a wife he loved fiercely.</i>

15:08.058 --> 15:12.829
<i>But their passion for each other
more than made up for it.</i>

15:15.633 --> 15:18.063
<i>Their love was constant.</i>

15:27.276 --> 15:30.531
<i>Through thick and thin, she stood by him.</i>

15:30.631 --> 15:32.509
Has the jury reached their verdict?

15:33.317 --> 15:35.352
We have, your honor.

15:35.452 --> 15:41.708
We, the above entitled jury do hereby
find Duke Donovan guilty on all counts.

15:41.959 --> 15:44.803
Order! Order in the court! Order!

15:46.497 --> 15:50.835
Now, the punishment for such a crime
is to hang by the neck until dead.

15:50.935 --> 15:55.573
However... in light of your many years
of community service,

15:55.673 --> 15:58.142
and your impeccable service record,

15:58.242 --> 16:01.982
the court has decided
to grant you a reprieve.

16:03.180 --> 16:06.450
Therefore, you are hereby sentenced
to life imprisonment

16:06.550 --> 16:08.519
at Yuma territorial prison.

16:08.619 --> 16:12.156
Where you shall do hard labor
for the rest of your life,

16:12.256 --> 16:13.991
without the possibility of parole.

16:14.291 --> 16:17.696
This court's adjourned. Take him away.

16:28.438 --> 16:33.439
<i>Duke came to Yuma prison
in the spring of 1893.</i>

16:34.078 --> 16:37.525
<i>His arrival was the talk of the place.</i>

16:37.625 --> 16:41.828
<i>He had as many enemies in Yuma
as he did admirers.</i>

16:41.928 --> 16:44.687
<i>He'd put half of them in there.</i>

16:54.797 --> 16:57.334
<i>He was a quiet, deliberate man.</i>

16:57.434 --> 16:59.270
<i>And those eyes...</i>

16:59.370 --> 17:03.205
<i>no one ever forgot those eyes.</i>

17:09.012 --> 17:11.882
All hands at attention!

17:11.982 --> 17:14.314
Warden's on the floor!

17:16.986 --> 17:19.924
I'd like to take a moment to...

17:20.023 --> 17:22.957
personally welcome you all to Yuma.

17:31.634 --> 17:33.221
I believe...

17:34.805 --> 17:37.520
you'll find your stay here to be a tough,

17:37.620 --> 17:39.894
but a fair one.

17:40.544 --> 17:42.780
We work a six-day week

17:42.880 --> 17:45.516
and rest on Sundays.

17:46.016 --> 17:48.650
That's reserved for the good Lord.

17:53.456 --> 17:56.927
I don't care who you are or what you did.

17:57.027 --> 17:59.394
But in here, you're mine.

18:01.464 --> 18:05.502
The government of this great territory
has asked us to assist

18:05.602 --> 18:09.073
in the construction
of a new section of prison.

18:09.573 --> 18:11.942
You'll get two squares a day.

18:12.042 --> 18:14.645
But you'll have to work
damn hard for them.

18:14.745 --> 18:17.548
However, in the end,

18:17.648 --> 18:22.086
you'll manage to do something
you failed to do in your previous lives.

18:22.586 --> 18:26.454
Make a positive contribution to society.

18:30.994 --> 18:34.098
I consider myself a fair man.

18:34.798 --> 18:37.568
Should you have a need
that has not been addressed,

18:37.668 --> 18:39.604
my door is always open.

18:40.004 --> 18:42.214
Ace high.

18:42.539 --> 18:45.107
Godspeed in your work.

18:49.645 --> 18:52.516
You ladies heard the warden.

18:52.616 --> 18:54.740
Back to work.

18:55.486 --> 18:59.290
Not you, Donovan. Come with me.

18:59.390 --> 19:01.456
Come on!

19:15.004 --> 19:18.342
You'll be stayin' in here. Warden Logan
thought it might be a good idea

19:18.442 --> 19:21.178
to keep you away
from the rest of the populace.

19:21.278 --> 19:25.180
Get changed. We'll come by
to collect your clothes.

19:42.231 --> 19:46.037
Remember, ladies.
There is no talkin' on the line.

19:46.637 --> 19:49.941
Unless you wanna be eating
your dinner through a straw.

19:50.441 --> 19:53.077
Keep it down! Stay quiet!

19:53.177 --> 19:55.710
Put your backs into it!

20:00.350 --> 20:01.720
Hey!

20:02.820 --> 20:05.193
Are you talkin' to me?

20:06.390 --> 20:08.058
Yeah.

20:08.158 --> 20:11.293
I like that pickaxe you got right there.

20:21.003 --> 20:22.639
Say...

20:22.739 --> 20:25.739
ain't you that law dog
everybody's been talking about?

20:25.839 --> 20:27.624
Yeah.

20:29.346 --> 20:31.580
That's me.

20:42.325 --> 20:46.394
That's right! These rocks
ain't gonna break themselves!

20:47.914 --> 20:52.670
<i>Donovan began to settle in
to his newfound lot at life in Yuma.</i>

20:52.770 --> 20:57.241
<i>Working by day and separated
from the other prisoners at night.</i>

20:57.341 --> 21:00.444
<i>Many began to forget he was there.</i>

21:00.544 --> 21:04.882
<i>As days turned to weeks,
the first month passed.</i>

21:04.982 --> 21:08.980
<i>It looked like Donovan
was gonna be all right.</i>

21:10.686 --> 21:14.124
<i>That is, until the day Will Penny...</i>

21:14.224 --> 21:17.394
<i>and Cage Dalton arrived.</i>

21:17.494 --> 21:22.599
<i>Dalton's ornery disposition
got him thrown in the hole immediately.</i>

21:24.068 --> 21:25.402
Straight to the hole.

21:25.702 --> 21:28.439
<i>As for Will Penny? Well...</i>

21:28.539 --> 21:31.105
<i>He would have more to do
with the fate of Duke Donovan</i>

21:31.205 --> 21:35.194
<i>than anyone could have ever realized.</i>

21:35.294 --> 21:38.307
That's right! Keep diggin'!

21:39.316 --> 21:41.450
You want some?

21:52.695 --> 21:54.997
No messin' around!

21:57.466 --> 22:01.071
Is it true? That if the warden's
in a bad mood,

22:01.271 --> 22:05.001
he makes us prisoners dig
with just the handles?

22:07.643 --> 22:09.466
No?

22:26.962 --> 22:29.499
What're you doing, kid?

22:34.737 --> 22:35.906
Keep workin'!

22:36.006 --> 22:39.255
Hey! Hey!

22:40.209 --> 22:42.980
Get a hold of yourself, goddamn it.

22:43.580 --> 22:44.832
Bunch of criminals.

22:44.932 --> 22:48.352
Kid, kid, look at me.
You want Cane to hear you?

22:48.452 --> 22:50.622
Son of a bitch.

22:52.823 --> 22:55.590
- Sorry about this, kid.
- No, no, no, no, no!

22:57.726 --> 22:59.930
What's going on here?

23:01.230 --> 23:03.334
I don't know.

23:03.734 --> 23:06.351
I think he's scorpion-bit.

23:08.070 --> 23:10.023
That true?

23:12.875 --> 23:15.510
Yes. It's just like he said.

23:19.949 --> 23:22.686
All right, all right.
Get him up on his feet.

23:22.786 --> 23:27.622
Get him up on his feet, take him
to the wagon. Get him a drink of water.

23:30.025 --> 23:34.563
Whole thing's gonna set us back today.
Warden's gonna blow up!

23:49.445 --> 23:51.882
Take a little sip of water.

23:51.982 --> 23:53.815
Thank you.

23:59.055 --> 24:01.599
Thank you, Mr. Donovan.

24:02.176 --> 24:04.585
Warden's on the block!

24:10.733 --> 24:13.003
What happened here?

24:13.603 --> 24:16.407
He got scorpion-bit, sir.

24:17.007 --> 24:18.940
Show me.

24:23.613 --> 24:26.264
- What's that, sir?
- Show me your bite.

24:28.085 --> 24:31.822
Well, you know,

24:31.922 --> 24:34.675
I don't know... You know, I...

24:34.775 --> 24:37.060
Show the bite now, or I'll shoot you dead.

24:37.160 --> 24:39.662
Okay! Please.

24:39.984 --> 24:43.033
There is no bite.
I don't got no bite, sir.

24:43.333 --> 24:44.956
I thought so.

24:53.676 --> 24:55.545
There, now. There, now.

24:55.745 --> 24:58.881
It feels good to tell the truth,
doesn't it, boy?

25:01.250 --> 25:03.074
Yes, it does, sir.

25:06.690 --> 25:08.892
Well, that's still no excuse.

25:08.992 --> 25:11.687
Oh, no! Please! Please!

25:13.262 --> 25:15.632
Throw him in the hole.

25:15.732 --> 25:18.423
I will not tolerate liars.

25:20.102 --> 25:22.038
Get up! Come on!

25:24.107 --> 25:26.709
You got a problem with that?

25:27.043 --> 25:29.179
He's just a kid.

25:29.479 --> 25:35.552
That kid cut a couple in El Paso
from ear to ear with a butcher's knife.

25:35.652 --> 25:39.990
But then, you know all about
murdering women and children, don't you?

25:40.490 --> 25:43.343
- Deputy Sullivan?
- Yes, sir?

25:43.443 --> 25:45.545
Throw him in the hole as well.

25:45.695 --> 25:47.664
Seein' as you're the sympathetic type,

25:47.764 --> 25:51.368
you can spend some time there
with your new friend.

25:51.468 --> 25:53.735
Let's go, Donovan.

25:57.440 --> 25:59.374
Come on.

26:07.816 --> 26:11.035
Next time, it won't be empty.

26:15.258 --> 26:18.059
I'm sorry about this, Donovan.

26:31.907 --> 26:33.675
All right.

27:09.379 --> 27:11.647
Checking the locks.

27:22.758 --> 27:24.695
Stop.

27:25.195 --> 27:28.326
Cut your goddamn tongue out.

27:34.738 --> 27:36.573
Get some sleep.

28:20.016 --> 28:22.550
Still one more week to go.

28:31.428 --> 28:33.329
Cocksucker.

29:03.792 --> 29:06.663
Ladies. Lockdown.

29:29.785 --> 29:31.688
Listen, Donovan.

29:31.788 --> 29:33.256
Yeah, kid?

29:33.356 --> 29:37.778
That... that thing in... Young Country?

29:40.129 --> 29:43.398
Did it really go down
the way they say it did?

29:45.768 --> 29:49.159
You know, in all my years
of working with the law...

29:49.573 --> 29:52.810
- there's one thing I learn.
- And what's that?

29:54.310 --> 29:57.881
Nothing ever went down
the way they say it did.

29:57.981 --> 29:59.783
Yeah.

30:01.348 --> 30:02.984
I guess so.

30:06.955 --> 30:08.959
What about you, kid?

30:09.059 --> 30:12.426
Guessing they got your story wrong, too?

30:13.629 --> 30:15.863
No, sir.

30:18.634 --> 30:20.171
I...

30:20.271 --> 30:22.772
I killed those people...

30:22.872 --> 30:25.206
deader than hell.

30:27.493 --> 30:30.361
After my parents died...

30:31.647 --> 30:35.045
the state took my sister and me.

30:35.145 --> 30:37.020
Put us in an institution.

30:37.120 --> 30:39.723
Then one day, this...

30:39.823 --> 30:42.058
this couple come, and...

30:42.158 --> 30:44.261
they say I was gonna go live with them.

30:44.761 --> 30:47.579
It was all right at first.

30:47.931 --> 30:50.666
Made some new friends and...

30:50.766 --> 30:53.725
had a roof over our head.

30:55.738 --> 30:57.608
Then...

30:58.908 --> 31:01.138
Then, one night...

31:01.538 --> 31:04.775
the wife came into my room.

31:04.875 --> 31:07.415
She wasn't wearin' nothing.

31:09.234 --> 31:12.988
And she said, if I told anyone,

31:13.088 --> 31:16.290
she was gonna send my sister away.

31:17.926 --> 31:19.733
So...

31:21.097 --> 31:23.834
I went along with it for a while.

31:24.334 --> 31:26.536
To protect her.

31:26.936 --> 31:28.972
Then I...

31:29.072 --> 31:32.874
I caught the old man with her.

31:34.226 --> 31:35.962
And I...

31:36.112 --> 31:39.046
I knew I had to do something.

31:42.618 --> 31:44.521
She was just...

31:44.621 --> 31:47.188
just a little girl, you know?

31:49.692 --> 31:51.726
Innocent.

31:56.732 --> 31:59.603
That's a hell of a thing, kid.

32:00.003 --> 32:01.671
That's a hell of a thing.

32:01.771 --> 32:04.939
It's a real touching tale, ain't it?

32:10.112 --> 32:12.195
What about you, Dalton?

32:12.295 --> 32:14.184
What's your story?

32:14.284 --> 32:16.219
Me?

32:16.319 --> 32:17.954
Oh, I've done...

32:18.054 --> 32:21.391
train-jumping and grave-robbing.

32:21.491 --> 32:25.725
Card-playing. Lying, cheating,
stealing pretty much my whole life.

32:25.825 --> 32:30.697
See, I was in... Clementina, New Mexico.

32:31.197 --> 32:33.785
<i>A few weeks ago, in a jail,
waiting on my trial date,</i>

32:33.885 --> 32:37.504
<i>and there was a man in this...
in the jail cell with me.</i>

32:37.604 --> 32:40.540
He's limey, through and through.

32:40.640 --> 32:45.549
Had a real nasty scar on the left side
of his face, result of getting shot.

32:45.819 --> 32:48.882
- What was his name?
- We ain't in no hurry, is we?

32:48.982 --> 32:51.885
- What was his name?
- I said, we ain't in no hurry.

32:55.722 --> 32:57.926
Where was I?

32:58.825 --> 33:00.860
Oh, yeah.

33:00.960 --> 33:03.430
This fellow claimed that...

33:03.530 --> 33:06.433
the gunshot to the head almost killed him.

33:06.533 --> 33:09.302
Bank robbery gone wrong, says he.

33:09.402 --> 33:11.606
Convinced this lawman...

33:12.031 --> 33:15.675
to go along with him on account
of he had a fine piece of ass

33:15.875 --> 33:18.211
held hostage, and he was gonna kill her.

33:18.311 --> 33:20.610
If the lawman didn't go along with him.

33:20.710 --> 33:22.082
I need your help, Duke.

33:22.182 --> 33:24.317
Put your gun down,
or I'm blowing her head right off!

33:24.417 --> 33:26.319
- He's gonna kill me!
- Put your gun down!

33:26.419 --> 33:28.388
Good. I need your help.

33:30.156 --> 33:33.005
- Keep talking.
- Well...

33:35.060 --> 33:38.398
Anyhow, they pulled off the robbery
and got back to the hideout.

33:38.498 --> 33:41.810
And they thought this lawman
was gonna be easy pickings,

33:41.910 --> 33:45.591
on account of he was
outnumbered and all, but...

33:46.439 --> 33:47.890
They was wrong.

33:50.843 --> 33:52.544
Come on! Let's go!

34:16.568 --> 34:19.039
Dark irony, it was.

34:19.139 --> 34:21.206
Seems that this lawman

34:21.306 --> 34:23.945
and the woman he was trying to help was...

34:24.045 --> 34:27.281
actually the very woman who betrayed him.

34:28.181 --> 34:29.616
She was a painted lady.

34:30.667 --> 34:32.953
<i>Lover of Levi Hardin.</i>

34:33.652 --> 34:36.172
Nursed him back to health.

34:36.755 --> 34:39.159
Was in on it all along.

34:39.458 --> 34:40.960
What happened to him?

34:41.061 --> 34:44.914
- Where is he?
- That's... that's the best part, see?

34:45.014 --> 34:48.935
Hardin was caught stealing cattle
in that part of country.

34:49.034 --> 34:50.587
That's a hangable offense.

34:50.687 --> 34:53.889
Hallelujah...

35:09.271 --> 35:12.091
- Sheriff?
- Levi Perry Hardin...

35:12.191 --> 35:17.731
you have been sentenced by a jury
to hang for your crimes until dead.

35:17.831 --> 35:20.432
Do you have any last words?

35:26.638 --> 35:29.976
Yeah. Y'all can kiss my ass!

36:06.244 --> 36:08.057
It's just funny how...

36:08.157 --> 36:13.061
a man can kill innocent women
and children and...

36:13.161 --> 36:15.286
get life in prison.

36:15.386 --> 36:17.457
But you take a man's cow?

36:19.292 --> 36:22.225
That's a whole 'nother
goddamn deal, ain't it?

36:25.364 --> 36:27.046
Guard!

36:28.418 --> 36:30.500
Guard!

36:35.307 --> 36:38.443
You tell the warden I'm ready to see him.

36:54.759 --> 36:56.996
Well, prisoner Donovan.

36:57.096 --> 36:59.797
This is a pleasant surprise.

37:01.600 --> 37:02.975
Leave us.

37:09.474 --> 37:11.744
I must commend you.

37:11.844 --> 37:14.380
You and your friend lasted a good while.

37:14.480 --> 37:17.717
Not as long as some, mind you, but...

37:17.817 --> 37:20.653
then, they didn't have the choice you did.

37:20.753 --> 37:24.890
I came here to tell you
that Levi Hardin is still alive.

37:24.990 --> 37:28.127
And I think I know where he's headed next.

37:28.227 --> 37:29.395
Excuse me?

37:29.645 --> 37:31.748
That's what you came to say to me?

37:31.848 --> 37:34.233
Did you hear what I said?

37:34.333 --> 37:36.636
Hardin's still alive.

37:36.736 --> 37:39.140
I think my wife's in danger.

37:40.740 --> 37:44.143
Well, that is a predicament.

37:44.243 --> 37:47.834
But I fail to see what that has to do
with our meeting here today.

37:47.934 --> 37:51.885
Listen, you son of a bitch!
I don't care what you think of me.

37:52.385 --> 37:54.053
My wife's in danger.

37:54.153 --> 37:56.923
Hardin's not gonna stop till
he gets to me any way he knows how!

37:57.023 --> 37:58.725
Now, you gotta do something!

37:58.825 --> 38:03.053
I suggest you take your hands
off my collar.

38:03.996 --> 38:08.201
One call from me, and you won't have
to worry about your precious wife.

38:08.301 --> 38:10.920
Because you'll be dead.

38:21.346 --> 38:23.349
Excellent.

38:23.749 --> 38:25.794
Guard!

38:27.186 --> 38:29.532
- Take him away.
- Back to the hole?

38:29.632 --> 38:34.243
No, put him in with the main population.
I'm sure they'll make room for him.

38:34.343 --> 38:37.831
I don't care what you think of me.
There's an innocent woman in danger.

38:37.931 --> 38:40.814
It's your duty to help her! It's your duty!

38:40.914 --> 38:43.904
I have a witness! Ask Dalton!

38:44.404 --> 38:46.600
Ask Dalton!

38:49.341 --> 38:51.778
They will crucify him, sir.

38:51.878 --> 38:53.721
Do it.

38:58.596 --> 39:00.620
Cy...

39:00.720 --> 39:04.749
you do make the best ribs
this side of the Mississippi.

39:12.697 --> 39:15.513
Look, Sullivan, as far as I can tell,
you're the only guy in here

39:15.613 --> 39:17.803
that has some sense of right and wrong.

39:17.903 --> 39:20.941
Now, if you won't help me, help her.

39:21.407 --> 39:23.359
Unhook him.

39:23.459 --> 39:26.514
She's all alone out there, Sullivan.

39:29.080 --> 39:31.484
You gotta help her.
You gotta do something!

39:31.584 --> 39:34.451
There ain't nothing I can do, goddamn it!

39:35.887 --> 39:38.089
What the hell am I supposed to do?

39:40.792 --> 39:42.639
Go on.

39:43.863 --> 39:45.729
Go!

39:49.634 --> 39:51.436
Go!

39:56.074 --> 39:59.443
Go, please.

40:01.714 --> 40:03.894
Son of a bitch.

40:14.158 --> 40:18.798
Mr. Donovan. I got me a nice place
right over here for you.

40:19.798 --> 40:22.201
You know, first thing
I did when I got out...

40:22.601 --> 40:25.369
was make a trade for this.

40:26.805 --> 40:28.758
Hey, Donovan.

40:30.176 --> 40:32.391
What's going on?

40:34.780 --> 40:37.297
You need to get out of here, kid.

40:37.397 --> 40:39.819
No matter what happens, you stay away.

40:39.919 --> 40:42.588
No, sir, I need to stay
right here with you.

40:42.688 --> 40:44.657
Beat it.

40:44.907 --> 40:47.543
Beat it!

40:47.793 --> 40:50.130
What you gonna do?

40:50.630 --> 40:51.784
I'm not sure.

40:51.884 --> 40:53.819
You remember me?

40:53.919 --> 40:56.456
Oh, yeah, I remember you.

40:56.756 --> 40:58.859
Jarvison.

40:59.559 --> 41:02.095
You and your rapist brother.

41:02.195 --> 41:05.965
It ain't proper to insult the dead
since you done the killin'.

41:06.065 --> 41:08.935
Kid, I want you to promise me something.

41:09.035 --> 41:10.903
Yes, sir.

41:11.003 --> 41:13.406
No matter what happens to me,

41:13.506 --> 41:15.841
you hang in there.

41:15.941 --> 41:18.778
You stick with the old-timers.
They know how to survive.

41:18.878 --> 41:21.402
- Yeah.
- You hear me?

41:21.502 --> 41:23.547
But you gonna be okay?

41:25.100 --> 41:28.119
- Just promise me.
- Yes, sir.

41:33.475 --> 41:34.979
Let it be.

41:40.516 --> 41:42.803
Yeah! Go!

41:44.036 --> 41:45.755
Come on, Mr. Donovan!

41:45.855 --> 41:47.845
Watch out!

42:08.176 --> 42:10.396
Come on. Come on.

42:10.496 --> 42:12.663
- Yeah.
- Come on.

42:26.311 --> 42:28.232
Take it... take it easy.

42:34.586 --> 42:37.657
Come on. Come on, come on.

42:37.757 --> 42:39.460
Hang in with me, now.

42:40.860 --> 42:42.826
It's all right, kid.

43:23.568 --> 43:26.906
You give him a decent burial.

43:45.757 --> 43:51.022
Ladies! Lockdown. It's night-night time.

44:04.175 --> 44:06.443
Checkin' the locks.

44:10.849 --> 44:13.050
Checking locks.

44:15.019 --> 44:16.954
Donovan.

44:22.994 --> 44:27.733
You don't belong here.
Meet me at the new yard in one hour.

44:27.833 --> 44:31.237
You get caught, you're on your own.

44:40.078 --> 44:42.312
Checkin' locks.

44:48.186 --> 44:51.832
Hey! Hey! Come on.

44:52.691 --> 44:56.737
Get down! Get down. Now, look.

44:58.163 --> 45:01.333
This... this tunnel will take you
into the cemetery,

45:01.433 --> 45:04.236
under the wall, and come out
by the warden's stables.

45:04.336 --> 45:06.439
There's a set of reins there
waiting for you.

45:06.539 --> 45:08.808
The warden had this dug
in case there was ever a mutiny.

45:08.908 --> 45:12.282
- What about you?
- Oh, no. My runnin' days...

45:12.382 --> 45:14.313
they behind me. You just get on.

45:14.413 --> 45:16.549
Rescue your lady.

45:16.649 --> 45:18.652
Hey, Donovan.

45:19.752 --> 45:23.656
I'm real sorry about that kid.
Now, go on, get to getting, 'cause...

45:23.756 --> 45:27.243
them guards'll be starting
a new set of rounds soon.

45:27.343 --> 45:29.628
Cyrus, you could get hung for this.

45:29.728 --> 45:33.564
No, don't worry about me.
I'll be all right.

46:55.313 --> 46:58.849
I thought you said
your running days were over.

46:59.651 --> 47:02.119
I changed my mind.

48:02.714 --> 48:06.218
<i>Well, I was shaken from my sleep</i>

48:06.318 --> 48:11.190
<i>As they dragged me to my feet</i>

48:11.290 --> 48:17.027
<i>I was mistaken by the long arm of the law</i>

48:18.329 --> 48:22.101
<i>And the lesson I have learned</i>

48:22.201 --> 48:25.971
<i>Is the innocent get burned</i>

48:26.071 --> 48:28.941
<i>And the guilty set you up</i>

48:29.341 --> 48:32.687
<i>To take the fall</i>

48:38.850 --> 48:42.688
<i>Nobody's guilty in here</i>

48:42.788 --> 48:47.259
<i>And the truth ain't always how it appears</i>

48:47.359 --> 48:49.668
<i>Our story's all the same</i>

48:49.768 --> 48:53.098
<i>Lord knows we've all been framed</i>

48:53.198 --> 48:57.397
<i>And the evidence is perfectly clear...</i>

49:26.264 --> 49:29.301
Sorry to trouble you, ma'am.
Got a man hurt.

49:29.401 --> 49:31.437
Can we use your well?

49:32.087 --> 49:33.353
Please?

49:36.240 --> 49:38.508
Bring him inside.

49:52.223 --> 49:56.457
You know. We'd better water these horses.

49:57.129 --> 49:58.997
There's ain't no time.

49:59.097 --> 50:02.852
Well, if we don't water them,
we're gonna be walking.

50:02.952 --> 50:04.448
All right.

50:12.977 --> 50:15.114
- Who was it?
- Donovan.

50:15.314 --> 50:18.490
- And Cy, too.
- Cy?

50:19.318 --> 50:21.628
Goddamn nigger.

50:22.020 --> 50:25.522
Bring them back. Dead.

50:32.380 --> 50:34.647
Put him over there.

50:50.081 --> 50:52.175
Get me some towels.

50:54.019 --> 50:55.821
Well...

50:56.321 --> 50:59.091
It's a real pretty place.

50:59.191 --> 51:00.993
Yep.

51:04.545 --> 51:06.399
Thank you.

51:07.199 --> 51:09.432
Not much further, friend.

51:11.903 --> 51:13.739
I'll tell you one thing, Cyrus.

51:13.839 --> 51:17.359
- You sure don't ride like a cook.
- That's 'cause I ain't one.

51:17.459 --> 51:19.473
Well, the warden sure liked your cooking.

51:19.573 --> 51:22.579
Yeah, well, that's 'cause
of my special sauce.

51:23.815 --> 51:27.749
- Oh, special sauce?
- You don't wanna know.

51:28.787 --> 51:31.690
- So what happened, anyway?
- What happened to what?

51:32.190 --> 51:35.226
To get you thrown in that rat-hole prison?

51:35.855 --> 51:38.163
Well, I was in the ninth.

51:38.263 --> 51:41.073
- You're a sure-enough buffalo soldier.
- That's right.

51:41.173 --> 51:44.720
- That's Colonel Hatch, wasn't it?
- Yes, sir.

51:44.970 --> 51:47.239
You know, we had us
this old buck sergeant.

51:47.339 --> 51:50.626
I mean, he wanted to ride me
all the way to Kansas City.

51:50.726 --> 51:53.579
Busting me down to a dog robber...

51:53.679 --> 51:58.138
- Made you a cook, did he?
- Yeah, I don't like being a cook.

51:58.238 --> 51:59.885
Let me ask you something, Donny.

51:59.985 --> 52:03.821
Now, really, do...
now, do I look like a damn cook?

52:05.723 --> 52:07.491
Cook.

52:15.516 --> 52:16.830
How's it look?

52:18.904 --> 52:21.023
He's got a bullet in his stomach.

52:21.123 --> 52:22.956
Gut-shot.

52:26.644 --> 52:28.914
How long ago was he shot?

52:29.014 --> 52:31.284
A few days ago.

52:48.699 --> 52:50.685
Where did it happen?

52:51.970 --> 52:54.871
Just across the border, in New Mexico.

52:57.041 --> 52:59.934
You know, you ask a lot of questions.

53:00.579 --> 53:02.715
Don't mean to.

53:03.315 --> 53:06.051
My husband was also a marshal.

53:06.151 --> 53:08.818
Donovan. You know him?

53:23.367 --> 53:26.169
We're gonna need to get him into town.

53:35.813 --> 53:38.016
I'll get the...

53:38.116 --> 53:41.286
Yeah, I know him. I know him real well.

54:09.681 --> 54:12.718
- What's wrong?
- Something ain't right.

54:12.818 --> 54:14.920
What do you mean?

54:15.020 --> 54:18.488
- Where are the horses?
- Well, they could be turned out.

54:25.145 --> 54:26.747
Maddy!

54:33.805 --> 54:35.774
Maddy! Maddy.

54:35.874 --> 54:38.177
Maddy, Maddy, Madeleine.

54:38.277 --> 54:40.160
Talk to me.

54:41.146 --> 54:45.617
I gotta get help. I gotta get help.
I gotta get help. I gotta get help.

54:45.717 --> 54:47.987
Oh, God...

54:50.465 --> 54:53.525
Cyrus, get the horses.
We gotta get to town.

54:53.625 --> 54:56.569
She's hurt! She's hurt bad.

54:56.669 --> 54:59.528
Don't die on me. You hear me? Don't die.

55:00.799 --> 55:03.351
I... Get the horses!

55:03.451 --> 55:06.572
Don. Don, she's gone.

55:08.470 --> 55:11.268
I'm real sorry, but she's gone.

55:36.901 --> 55:40.205
- Another drink?
- No.

55:40.705 --> 55:42.474
I lost my thirst.

55:42.774 --> 55:47.413
Well, you wanted the truth, didn't you?
I just gave you what you asked for.

55:48.413 --> 55:52.682
- Yeah, I did, didn't I?
- You sure as hell did.

55:54.551 --> 55:58.675
I didn't ask you to come
snooping around here, you know?

56:00.332 --> 56:03.428
Why are you telling me all this?
Why don't you just let me walk out of here?

56:03.528 --> 56:09.191
Maybe I felt sorry for you. Being
in trouble with your chiefy and all.

56:09.501 --> 56:12.438
Or maybe it's just because...

56:13.438 --> 56:17.509
you remind me of myself
when I was your age.

56:17.609 --> 56:19.844
I don't know.

56:19.944 --> 56:23.782
I do know... you didn't come here
to talk about me.

56:23.882 --> 56:26.902
You came here to talk about Donovan.

56:27.953 --> 56:29.768
All right.

56:31.123 --> 56:34.248
Well, then let's see. Where was I?

56:34.593 --> 56:36.629
Oh, yeah.

56:37.429 --> 56:41.033
Hardin and his men continued west.

56:41.133 --> 56:45.003
To them, the events that had transpired
just a few hours earlier

56:45.103 --> 56:48.140
<i>were nothing more than a passing amusement</i>

56:48.240 --> 56:50.743
<i>to be boasted about.</i>

56:51.243 --> 56:54.444
<i>Oh, my darlin' Madeleine</i>

56:56.330 --> 56:59.532
Go on, Charlie, have fun with it.

57:04.088 --> 57:06.056
Come on.

57:07.759 --> 57:13.232
Wake up. I know you're not doing well,
but you're slowing us all up here.

57:13.332 --> 57:15.331
You all right?

58:07.084 --> 58:10.155
They've been here, all right.
That's their hoofprints in the watering hole.

58:10.255 --> 58:12.424
All right, then.

58:12.524 --> 58:15.291
We'll set up camp here for the night.

58:37.981 --> 58:40.152
You know I'm real sorry, Donovan.

58:40.252 --> 58:42.853
Something like this, I...

58:42.953 --> 58:45.490
I just don't got no words.

58:46.190 --> 58:49.165
This ain't your fight, Cyrus.

58:49.694 --> 58:51.263
Yeah, well.

58:51.363 --> 58:56.468
It seems to me... I've been fighting
other people's wars my whole life.

58:56.568 --> 58:59.671
And I expect this ain't no different, but...

58:59.771 --> 59:01.940
sometimes there's wars

59:02.040 --> 59:04.647
a man just got to fight.

59:07.878 --> 59:10.614
Mind telling me what the plan is?

59:11.782 --> 59:14.517
I'm gonna track him down.

59:16.053 --> 59:19.870
All the way to the gates
of hell, if I have to.

59:21.293 --> 59:23.265
All right.

59:45.393 --> 59:46.574
Yeah.

59:49.053 --> 59:52.957
I'll tell you what.
That is a fine fire right there.

59:53.057 --> 59:55.694
Think we gonna catch 'em tomorrow?

59:56.861 --> 59:59.798
If they're headed
where I expect they're headed.

59:59.898 --> 01:00:02.901
- Where's that?
- Backside of the whetstones.

01:00:03.001 --> 01:00:05.578
- Donovan's ranch.
- How far?

01:00:05.678 --> 01:00:10.706
Oh, I don't know.
Another day, or most of it, at least.

01:00:12.610 --> 01:00:14.444
Damn.

01:00:18.415 --> 01:00:20.810
You think he did it?

01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:23.288
Did what?

01:00:23.388 --> 01:00:26.091
Robbed that bank? Killed those people?

01:00:26.191 --> 01:00:29.034
Hell yeah, he done it.

01:00:29.194 --> 01:00:31.272
I don't know.

01:00:32.597 --> 01:00:35.233
I just don't know.

01:00:35.333 --> 01:00:37.901
You'd better get to knowin'.

01:01:21.812 --> 01:01:24.322
She done this for you, didn't she?

01:01:25.183 --> 01:01:28.118
She did a lot of things for me.

01:01:47.271 --> 01:01:51.609
<i>Thunder rolls up from the ground</i>

01:01:51.709 --> 01:01:55.514
<i>Birds fly away from the sound</i>

01:01:55.614 --> 01:02:01.730
<i>A lone hero stands in the eye of the storm</i>

01:02:03.721 --> 01:02:07.059
<i>And demons dance in the fire</i>

01:02:07.459 --> 01:02:12.430
<i>Chasing desire like devil's companions</i>

01:02:12.530 --> 01:02:15.950
<i>But one will stand when there's none</i>

01:02:16.050 --> 01:02:19.652
<i>When black horses run</i>

01:02:20.587 --> 01:02:23.683
<i>Through the dark canyon</i>

01:02:39.823 --> 01:02:42.026
That's not gonna do any good now.

01:02:42.126 --> 01:02:45.145
I don't reckon it's gonna
do no harm, neither.

01:02:47.497 --> 01:02:49.365
Ready?

01:02:54.805 --> 01:02:57.565
Go ahead, I'll catch up with you.

01:02:57.675 --> 01:03:00.556
- All right.
- <i>I'll be willing to go down</i>

01:03:00.656 --> 01:03:04.025
<i>Where I've never been before</i>

01:03:04.125 --> 01:03:06.821
<i>If you will hold the door</i>

01:03:06.921 --> 01:03:09.521
<i>If you will hold the door</i>

01:03:09.621 --> 01:03:12.623
<i>I will run through the valley</i>

01:03:12.723 --> 01:03:15.960
<i>Where the sun will never shine</i>

01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:18.963
<i>If you will be my light</i>

01:03:19.063 --> 01:03:21.866
<i>If you will be my light</i>

01:03:21.966 --> 01:03:24.569
<i>And hard as I try</i>

01:03:24.669 --> 01:03:27.972
<i>There's just no place to hide</i>

01:03:28.072 --> 01:03:30.517
<i>Until this journey ends</i>

01:03:30.617 --> 01:03:33.878
<i>And there's no tears left to cry</i>

01:03:33.978 --> 01:03:37.231
<i>And I'll keep you with me</i>

01:03:37.331 --> 01:03:40.051
<i>Safe in my memory</i>

01:03:40.151 --> 01:03:45.223
<i>And I will see you on the other side</i>

01:03:45.723 --> 01:03:47.907
<i>Of the ride</i>

01:03:51.594 --> 01:03:54.475
<i>And I am bound to find the man</i>

01:03:54.575 --> 01:03:57.702
<i>That I used to be back then</i>

01:03:57.802 --> 01:04:00.588
<i>And before we meet again</i>

01:04:00.688 --> 01:04:03.458
<i>And before we meet again</i>

01:04:03.608 --> 01:04:06.911
<i>When I put this anger down</i>

01:04:07.011 --> 01:04:09.614
<i>Six feet in the ground</i>

01:04:09.714 --> 01:04:12.817
<i>I will never kill again</i>

01:04:12.917 --> 01:04:15.920
<i>I will never kill again</i>

01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:18.472
<i>And hard as I try</i>

01:04:18.572 --> 01:04:21.893
<i>There's just no place to hide</i>

01:04:21.993 --> 01:04:24.528
<i>Until this journey ends</i>

01:04:24.628 --> 01:04:28.066
<i>And there's no tears left to cry</i>

01:04:28.166 --> 01:04:31.202
<i>And I'll keep you with me</i>

01:04:31.302 --> 01:04:34.105
<i>Safe in my memory</i>

01:04:34.205 --> 01:04:38.974
<i>And I will see you on the other side</i>

01:04:39.644 --> 01:04:42.743
<i>Of the ride</i>

01:05:03.133 --> 01:05:05.034
Take the reins.

01:05:09.106 --> 01:05:10.979
What in the hell is this?

01:05:12.110 --> 01:05:14.112
That's sage.

01:05:14.212 --> 01:05:16.114
That's an Indian sign.

01:05:16.214 --> 01:05:18.718
Indian sign? The hell you talkin' about?

01:05:20.818 --> 01:05:23.287
Cy must still be with him.

01:05:23.387 --> 01:05:26.190
Let's get down to the barn,
see if we can't find some grain.

01:05:26.290 --> 01:05:29.260
Figure if they're going after Hardin
they'll be in Rio Verdes.

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:31.728
Indian sign, my ass.

01:05:34.548 --> 01:05:36.634
Hey. Hey!

01:05:36.734 --> 01:05:38.880
Show some goddamn respect!

01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:42.792
I don't care who you are. If I catch you doing
something like that again, so help me God,

01:05:42.892 --> 01:05:45.643
when we leave here, I'll bury you here.

01:05:45.743 --> 01:05:48.210
That goes for both of you.

01:05:49.947 --> 01:05:51.750
Bitch.

01:05:58.789 --> 01:06:02.724
Yeah, you think the word's out
on our escape yet?

01:06:05.529 --> 01:06:07.832
There ain't no railroad.

01:06:07.932 --> 01:06:10.251
Probably no telegraph.

01:06:10.816 --> 01:06:13.371
Shouldn't be no problem, then.

01:06:13.771 --> 01:06:17.441
Yeah, unless Hurley's
still the marshal here.

01:06:17.541 --> 01:06:19.644
He knows you?

01:06:20.244 --> 01:06:22.513
He's an old acquaintance.

01:06:22.613 --> 01:06:26.561
Hell, Donovan, everybody
in this country knows you.

01:06:27.450 --> 01:06:29.171
Let's go.

01:06:38.195 --> 01:06:41.702
Get me a bloody bottle of whiskey! Now!

01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:51.308
- Maybe.
- Maybe.

01:06:59.750 --> 01:07:04.219
It's a little early
in the morning, ain't it, boys?

01:07:21.806 --> 01:07:24.108
Drink it up, boys!

01:08:15.076 --> 01:08:17.509
We don't see too many...

01:08:22.166 --> 01:08:24.903
We don't see...

01:08:25.203 --> 01:08:28.337
- too many...
- What?

01:08:29.906 --> 01:08:31.941
Strangers.

01:08:34.077 --> 01:08:36.545
Around these parts.

01:08:38.314 --> 01:08:41.337
So, what'll it be?

01:08:42.486 --> 01:08:46.421
Whiskey. Two glasses.

01:08:58.734 --> 01:09:01.170
Leave the bottle.

01:09:05.826 --> 01:09:07.282
What're you looking at?

01:09:09.246 --> 01:09:12.283
I said, what the hell...

01:09:12.383 --> 01:09:14.685
are you looking at?

01:09:14.785 --> 01:09:17.154
You got any coffee?

01:09:17.354 --> 01:09:19.156
Coffee?

01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:23.461
Yeah. Sure. Of course, I'll...

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:26.987
- I'll be right back.
- That'd be a good idea.

01:09:38.725 --> 01:09:42.313
I know you... I know you heard me.

01:09:42.712 --> 01:09:45.048
What're you looking at?

01:09:47.218 --> 01:09:49.587
Oh, and you, too?

01:09:50.587 --> 01:09:52.890
What're you looking at?

01:09:52.990 --> 01:09:57.127
That is a mighty nice bandanna
you got there.

01:10:00.063 --> 01:10:02.400
You like this? Thank you.

01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:05.276
I know you, don't I?

01:10:05.376 --> 01:10:07.138
Maybe.

01:10:07.238 --> 01:10:10.608
- Been around here before?
- No.

01:10:10.808 --> 01:10:15.147
I'm from Sonora. They call me Chale.

01:10:16.147 --> 01:10:18.780
Well, that is quite a name.

01:10:20.417 --> 01:10:23.254
You're my friend, right?

01:10:23.354 --> 01:10:27.245
But you gotta tell me something, friend.

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:30.792
Why the hell...

01:10:30.892 --> 01:10:35.164
do you come in here with your
mulo slave who stares at people?

01:10:37.767 --> 01:10:39.971
It's rude, no?

01:10:40.071 --> 01:10:42.606
No, he's not rude.

01:10:42.706 --> 01:10:44.876
He just doesn't like scumbags.

01:10:45.176 --> 01:10:47.023
No, that ain't it.

01:10:47.123 --> 01:10:49.846
I just don't like you.

01:10:54.351 --> 01:10:56.518
Come on, let's go.

01:11:18.374 --> 01:11:21.243
I'll be needing that horse, governor.

01:11:32.055 --> 01:11:35.926
I do know... who you are.

01:12:17.433 --> 01:12:20.937
- Was he here? Was he here?
- Who?

01:12:25.975 --> 01:12:28.413
Tell me what he looked like.

01:12:29.013 --> 01:12:31.515
Tell me what he looked like!

01:12:31.815 --> 01:12:34.418
He was a rough-lookin' man.

01:12:34.518 --> 01:12:37.736
He had a bad scar
that run across his face.

01:12:39.722 --> 01:12:43.127
We didn't mean no trouble.
We're just trying to make a living is all.

01:12:43.227 --> 01:12:45.663
You didn't mean any trouble?

01:12:45.763 --> 01:12:48.797
You didn't mean no trouble?

01:13:32.575 --> 01:13:35.587
If you're gonna kill me, start shooting.

01:13:35.687 --> 01:13:37.882
Easy, Duke.

01:13:38.682 --> 01:13:40.684
Just need to talk.

01:13:40.784 --> 01:13:43.019
There ain't no time.

01:13:53.997 --> 01:13:58.402
They took off that way.
Best I can tell, on one horse.

01:13:58.502 --> 01:14:01.918
Good. We can catch them then.

01:14:02.506 --> 01:14:05.542
Can't lie, if they come looking for you.

01:14:05.642 --> 01:14:07.971
I wouldn't expect you to.

01:14:08.412 --> 01:14:11.081
Come on. Let's go.

01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:49.070
Greetings.

01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:52.240
I'm Deputy Tom Sullivan. Yuma.

01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:57.145
Marshal Hurley. What can I do for you?

01:14:57.895 --> 01:15:00.524
- We're looking for a couple of men.
- One of them's a nigger...

01:15:00.624 --> 01:15:05.202
Duke Donovan. The other one's name is
Cyrus Parker, and he is a buffalo soldier.

01:15:05.302 --> 01:15:07.304
They broke out of Yuma.

01:15:07.404 --> 01:15:10.608
Yeah, they came through town
a couple of hours ago.

01:15:11.008 --> 01:15:12.977
Killed two men.

01:15:13.077 --> 01:15:16.894
- I ain't surprised.
- Me either.

01:15:17.694 --> 01:15:21.953
Those were a couple men who needed
killing. Rolled with Levi Hardin's gang.

01:15:22.753 --> 01:15:26.501
We caught wind that Hardin's men
killed Donovan's wife.

01:15:29.092 --> 01:15:31.595
- That they did.
- Son of a bitch.

01:15:32.245 --> 01:15:36.166
- Any idea where they're headed?
- Oh, my guess would be the border.

01:15:36.266 --> 01:15:41.369
- The border?
- Yeah. They're hot on his trail.

01:15:42.839 --> 01:15:46.075
- Whose?
- Hardin's.

01:15:49.178 --> 01:15:50.984
Obliged.

01:15:51.484 --> 01:15:53.798
- Let's go.
- Thanks for the whiskey.

01:15:59.222 --> 01:16:04.495
<i>Freedom is your prison
when you curse to keep on running</i>

01:16:04.595 --> 01:16:06.830
<i>Hard to tell the difference</i>

01:16:06.930 --> 01:16:09.200
<i>From the hunter and the hunted</i>

01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:14.772
<i>Looking for redemption
down the barrel of a gun</i>

01:16:14.872 --> 01:16:17.408
<i>Your finger on the trigger</i>

01:16:17.508 --> 01:16:22.513
<i>Your back against the sun going down</i>

01:16:22.613 --> 01:16:25.182
<i>Going down</i>

01:16:25.282 --> 01:16:30.521
<i>Going down to the place
where no mercy can be found</i>

01:16:30.621 --> 01:16:34.293
<i>And you pay for what you've done
with your soul</i>

01:16:35.943 --> 01:16:41.131
<i>Going down where the darkest
of the angels circle round</i>

01:16:41.231 --> 01:16:43.801
<i>He's just waiting 'cause he knows</i>

01:16:43.901 --> 01:16:46.203
<i>Yes, he knows</i>

01:16:46.303 --> 01:16:48.640
<i>It's going down</i>

01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:51.582
<i>Going down</i>

01:17:07.924 --> 01:17:10.859
Come on, Walker! Go!

01:17:25.576 --> 01:17:27.342
Easy.

01:17:38.421 --> 01:17:41.390
- He ain't been dead long.
- Yeah.

01:17:46.997 --> 01:17:49.831
Come on. Come on. Get up, Cy.

01:17:58.941 --> 01:18:01.178
How bad is it?

01:18:01.478 --> 01:18:05.482
Well... didn't catch any bone,
but it's a good one.

01:18:07.184 --> 01:18:09.551
What's going on over there?

01:18:12.756 --> 01:18:15.559
That's three of the warden's deputies.

01:18:15.659 --> 01:18:18.327
They're gonna be sitting ducks for Hardin.

01:18:21.097 --> 01:18:23.198
Foster, check it out.

01:18:27.837 --> 01:18:30.107
What're you doing?

01:18:31.207 --> 01:18:36.060
I can't let innocent men get killed.
Even if they are trying to kill me.

01:18:36.914 --> 01:18:39.767
- Think they lost us?
- Listen.

01:18:40.717 --> 01:18:44.052
- What is it?
- It's too quiet.

01:18:45.989 --> 01:18:48.292
Sullivan, get down!

01:18:53.030 --> 01:18:55.747
Goddamn it! Jesus!

01:18:56.600 --> 01:19:00.327
- Do something! Do something!
- Goddamn it!

01:19:14.284 --> 01:19:16.396
Son of a bitch!

01:19:22.658 --> 01:19:26.161
He's already dead! Already dead!

01:19:30.733 --> 01:19:32.701
Got one!

01:19:43.646 --> 01:19:47.838
We gotta get back to Cyrus.
Ready? Let's go.

01:19:57.294 --> 01:19:59.260
Damn, my leg!

01:20:01.330 --> 01:20:03.266
How you doing, Cy?

01:20:03.566 --> 01:20:06.470
How the hell's it look like I'm doing?

01:20:06.570 --> 01:20:09.640
Donovan, trying to get yourself shot?

01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:13.547
Yeah, it appears so.

01:20:20.482 --> 01:20:22.217
Come on.

01:20:26.355 --> 01:20:28.325
We are dead men down here.

01:20:28.425 --> 01:20:31.462
Sullivan, we gotta get to higher ground.

01:20:31.562 --> 01:20:33.854
Now you're making sense.

01:20:34.164 --> 01:20:36.166
Cy, I'm gonna need that mare's leg.

01:20:36.266 --> 01:20:37.846
Yep.

01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:53.350
When I give the signal...

01:20:53.450 --> 01:20:56.195
- you give it all you got, all right?
- All right.

01:20:56.295 --> 01:20:59.574
All right, Tom. You break when I do.

01:21:00.524 --> 01:21:01.801
Let's go!

01:21:09.251 --> 01:21:11.065
Shit!

01:21:15.338 --> 01:21:17.172
Come on, Walker, let's go!

01:21:18.908 --> 01:21:20.644
Fuck!

01:21:20.944 --> 01:21:23.297
How many bullets you got left?

01:21:23.397 --> 01:21:25.851
Four. Five, maybe.

01:22:42.892 --> 01:22:46.403
So I guess we're finally gonna
get to finish what we started.

01:22:47.064 --> 01:22:49.299
Finish what you started.

01:22:49.829 --> 01:22:54.037
It doesn't matter.
The way I see it, we both lose.

01:22:54.137 --> 01:22:58.476
You took my money. And I took your life.

01:22:59.776 --> 01:23:02.412
You know what,
I'm gonna let God sort that out.

01:23:02.512 --> 01:23:04.245
Fuck you!

01:23:10.286 --> 01:23:13.290
So this is it.
This is the best you can do.

01:23:13.390 --> 01:23:15.225
The great...

01:23:15.325 --> 01:23:18.168
Duke Donovan!

01:23:22.265 --> 01:23:26.042
Get up. Get up, Duke. Get up.

01:23:34.376 --> 01:23:35.780
Fucking...

01:23:42.317 --> 01:23:45.820
Duke! Duke!

01:23:49.759 --> 01:23:52.480
She cried out for you, you know!

01:23:53.463 --> 01:23:55.296
For you to save her.

01:23:57.533 --> 01:24:00.535
Oh, she was a live one!

01:24:02.204 --> 01:24:05.807
She wiggled like a little fish, she did!

01:24:14.683 --> 01:24:16.987
She was all wet and slimy.

01:24:17.087 --> 01:24:19.935
I slid right up, right in.

01:25:17.913 --> 01:25:19.901
You know I gotta bring you in.

01:25:21.685 --> 01:25:24.122
You're gonna have to kill me first.

01:25:25.422 --> 01:25:27.724
Yeah, I know.

01:25:28.124 --> 01:25:29.843
I ain't got no choice.

01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:32.996
We all got choices.

01:25:33.096 --> 01:25:35.654
I made mine a long time ago.

01:25:39.235 --> 01:25:40.623
Do it.

01:25:46.575 --> 01:25:48.676
Do it.

01:25:48.776 --> 01:25:50.881
I can't.

01:25:51.131 --> 01:25:52.901
Do it.

01:25:54.651 --> 01:25:56.702
I can't.

01:26:54.576 --> 01:26:57.814
You're getting pretty good
on that thing, Cy.

01:26:58.714 --> 01:27:00.517
Hey, Donovan.

01:27:00.617 --> 01:27:03.954
You ever wonder why
I helped you escape out that prison?

01:27:04.254 --> 01:27:06.930
It's 'cause you help me remember...

01:27:07.290 --> 01:27:09.459
how I used to walk.

01:27:09.559 --> 01:27:12.413
And I'm mighty beholden to you.

01:27:14.997 --> 01:27:19.033
Here. This'll keep you company
on your travels.

01:27:20.669 --> 01:27:23.907
You know, you might even learn
how to play the damn thing.

01:27:24.007 --> 01:27:25.876
Thanks.

01:27:26.276 --> 01:27:29.746
<i>Donovan never told Sullivan
where he was going.</i>

01:27:29.846 --> 01:27:34.417
<i>Both men wanted it that way
so as not to put the other at risk.</i>

01:27:35.117 --> 01:27:38.488
<i>Cyrus rode east. Some say to Louisiana.</i>

01:27:38.688 --> 01:27:43.093
<i>Where it was rumored
he'd prospered in dry goods.</i>

01:27:43.893 --> 01:27:46.730
<i>Sullivan returned to Yuma with a bounty.</i>

01:27:46.830 --> 01:27:51.367
<i>Of course, it was so charred,
no one could really tell who it was.</i>

01:27:51.467 --> 01:27:56.537
<i>So the warden had to take
Sullivan's word that it was Donovan.</i>

01:27:58.273 --> 01:28:01.878
<i>That day, Sullivan left Yuma for good.</i>

01:28:02.288 --> 01:28:04.982
<i>Changed his name to Duncan.</i>

01:28:05.782 --> 01:28:09.119
And a month later became
the sheriff of Wickenburg.

01:28:09.219 --> 01:28:12.011
Where he lives to this day.

01:28:14.707 --> 01:28:17.726
So Sullivan never up and disappeared
like everyone thought.

01:28:18.082 --> 01:28:20.651
He just changed his name.

01:28:20.751 --> 01:28:23.266
Now you're catching on.

01:28:27.336 --> 01:28:30.138
Wait, if... if you aren't Sullivan...

01:28:31.673 --> 01:28:34.744
and only those three survived that day...

01:28:34.844 --> 01:28:37.014
then you're...

01:28:38.663 --> 01:28:42.450
- That makes you...
- 82 years old.

01:28:48.291 --> 01:28:51.458
I thought you said you got that gun
the day Duke Donovan died.

01:28:51.558 --> 01:28:53.496
I did.

01:28:53.596 --> 01:28:59.598
I inherited this gun from Duke Donovan
the day he became Seymour Redfield.

01:29:00.703 --> 01:29:03.206
He didn't need it anymore.

01:29:03.306 --> 01:29:05.109
He was a dead man.

01:29:06.509 --> 01:29:09.446
There's no statute
of limitations on murder.

01:29:09.546 --> 01:29:11.506
Is there?

01:29:12.148 --> 01:29:15.041
No, son, I'm afraid not.

01:29:15.685 --> 01:29:18.320
Just got one more question.

01:29:19.189 --> 01:29:22.660
- What is it?
- The robbery.

01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:26.529
Were you tricked into it?

01:29:26.629 --> 01:29:30.564
- Or behind it?
- What do you think?

01:29:45.814 --> 01:29:48.472
I think I need another drink.

01:30:01.613 --> 01:30:03.638
Can I ask you one more thing?

01:30:06.101 --> 01:30:08.638
Why'd you tell me everything?

01:30:08.738 --> 01:30:12.442
Well, I figure the sand in my hourglass
is running a little low,

01:30:12.542 --> 01:30:16.197
and somebody ought to know the truth
about what really happened.

01:30:17.047 --> 01:30:20.950
Just keep it under your sombrero,
will you? Until after I'm gone?

01:30:26.255 --> 01:30:28.089
Thank you.

01:31:12.401 --> 01:31:16.756
<i>Thunder rolls up from the ground</i>

01:31:16.856 --> 01:31:20.844
<i>Birds fly away from the sound</i>

01:31:20.944 --> 01:31:26.847
<i>A lone hero stands in the eye of the storm</i>

01:31:29.651 --> 01:31:34.023
<i>Lightning cracks open the sky</i>

01:31:34.123 --> 01:31:38.528
<i>Mothers take their children and hide</i>

01:31:38.628 --> 01:31:44.499
<i>Evil rides and the day of darkness is born</i>

01:31:46.351 --> 01:31:49.689
<i>When fear blocks out the light</i>

01:31:49.789 --> 01:31:51.891
<i>And the day turns to night</i>

01:31:51.991 --> 01:31:54.928
<i>And hope is abandoned</i>

01:31:55.028 --> 01:31:58.648
<i>And demons dance in the fire</i>

01:31:58.748 --> 01:32:03.586
<i>Chasing desire like devil's companions</i>

01:32:03.686 --> 01:32:07.290
<i>But one will stand when there's none</i>

01:32:07.390 --> 01:32:10.958
<i>When black horses run</i>

01:32:11.827 --> 01:32:16.096
<i>Through the dark canyon</i>

01:32:22.287 --> 01:32:26.376
<i>Gunshots tear open the air</i>

01:32:26.476 --> 01:32:30.647
<i>Trembling hearts send up a prayer</i>

01:32:30.747 --> 01:32:33.483
<i>Hoping someone will come</i>

01:32:33.583 --> 01:32:37.357
<i>To earn their salvation</i>

01:32:39.454 --> 01:32:43.726
<i>When rocks of faith crumble to dust</i>

01:32:43.826 --> 01:32:48.198
<i>You search your heart for someone to trust</i>

01:32:48.298 --> 01:32:50.667
<i>Sometimes it's you</i>

01:32:50.767 --> 01:32:54.501
<i>You've always been chasing</i>

01:32:56.054 --> 01:32:59.559
<i>When fear blocks out the light</i>

01:32:59.659 --> 01:33:01.761
<i>And day turns to night</i>

01:33:01.861 --> 01:33:04.697
<i>And hope is abandoned</i>

01:33:04.797 --> 01:33:08.384
<i>And demons dance in the fire</i>

01:33:08.484 --> 01:33:13.489
<i>Chasing desire like devil's companions</i>

01:33:13.589 --> 01:33:16.960
<i>But one will stand when there's none</i>

01:33:17.060 --> 01:33:20.428
<i>When black horses run</i>

01:33:21.630 --> 01:33:25.599
<i>Through the dark canyon</i>

01:33:26.305 --> 01:33:32.829
