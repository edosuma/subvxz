WEBVTT

00:03.536 --> 00:04.730
Better watch yourself, boy.

00:04.904 --> 00:08.237
Here I come. Penny, down low to Shaq.
Shaq, back out to Penny for three.

00:08.408 --> 00:13.971
Boom, in Clyde's face. Ten bucks.
Now give me my money, Pee Wee.

00:14.681 --> 00:15.705
Double or nothing.

00:15.882 --> 00:19.340
- This time, you're going down.
- I can't believe you two, wasting your time.

00:19.519 --> 00:22.010
Aren't you both a little old
to be playing video games?

00:22.188 --> 00:23.849
This isn't just a video game, Dad.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.855
This is the new 32-bit super system...

00:26.026 --> 00:29.257
...with digitized sound,
VGA graphics and full-motion video.

00:29.429 --> 00:32.091
Yo, and it's real cool too.

00:32.265 --> 00:34.825
Those games are just a waste of time.

00:35.001 --> 00:38.061
This has just arrived for you,
Master Carlton. It's from Princeton.

00:38.471 --> 00:41.269
Princeton? Open it up.

00:45.745 --> 00:48.236
I can't. What if it's a rejection?

00:48.648 --> 00:52.311
You've been rejected your whole life.
You should be used to it by now. Come on.

00:52.952 --> 00:56.149
Well, here goes nothing.

00:59.626 --> 01:02.618
I'm in! I'm going to Princeton!

01:02.796 --> 01:04.525
Yes, yes, yes.

01:14.674 --> 01:17.666
It finally happened. Somebody, pinch me.

01:17.844 --> 01:19.471
Ow!

01:19.646 --> 01:23.514
Congratulations, son. This is wonderful.
You've been waiting for this for so long.

01:23.683 --> 01:26.447
- Hey, let's go out and celebrate, huh?
- Yeah. Come on.

01:26.619 --> 01:27.950
Oh, I gotta get my jacket.

01:28.121 --> 01:31.318
- I'll be right along with you. Okay. Yeah.
- All right. All right.

01:33.460 --> 01:35.690
Pa-yow! Passes down the court.
There he goes.

01:35.862 --> 01:38.956
Blinding speed. Goes up for the lay...
Ha, ha.

01:41.968 --> 01:44.732
Well, you see,
you two left the TV on, and...

01:44.904 --> 01:46.235
And, well, I, you know...

01:48.208 --> 01:49.641
You want a piece of me?

03:10.256 --> 03:12.520
Hey, G, come on, man.
Can I get some spare change?

03:12.692 --> 03:14.353
No. Use your own money.

03:14.527 --> 03:16.427
G, come on.
It's dime-a-frame bowling day.

03:16.596 --> 03:19.292
It's always more fun
when you use other people's dimes.

03:19.899 --> 03:22.800
For the last time, Master William,
I have no spare change.

03:23.636 --> 03:25.627
What about that piggy bank
in your closet...

03:25.805 --> 03:28.797
<i>...under them issues
of Big Butted Butler Babes?</i>

03:30.743 --> 03:32.677
That was just a lucky guess, man.

03:34.647 --> 03:37.013
Hey, Uncle Phil. Man, what's up?

03:37.183 --> 03:40.380
Hey, look, look, you got some spare change
for a brother, Uncle Phil?

03:40.887 --> 03:43.355
Carlton's going to Princeton
and you're panhandling.

03:43.523 --> 03:46.458
It's nice to see that everybody's
reaching their potential.

03:46.693 --> 03:49.389
It's dime-a-frame bowling day.
You got some spare change?

03:49.562 --> 03:52.861
Doesn't Carlton's recent success
light the fire of ambition in you?

03:53.866 --> 03:55.299
No.

03:55.802 --> 03:57.667
You gotta have something in this pocket.

03:57.837 --> 04:00.237
- Get off me.
- Don't make me go in there.

04:00.406 --> 04:03.170
- Here. Take this. Get out of my face.
- Thank you. Thank you.

04:03.343 --> 04:06.744
Oh, Hil, why so blue?

04:06.913 --> 04:10.781
Ha, ha. I volunteered to spend the weekend
with a flock of Blue Birds.

04:10.950 --> 04:13.680
Well, just keep them away from my car.
I just got it waxed.

04:13.853 --> 04:16.185
They're not real birds.
They're like Girl Scouts.

04:16.356 --> 04:18.790
And I am the honorary Hen Mother.

04:18.958 --> 04:21.358
Hilary, that's wonderful.
What do you have planned?

04:21.793 --> 04:26.527
Planned? I don't know.
I thought I'd just watch them run around.

04:26.699 --> 04:29.862
I think groups like this
usually like to do outdoorsy things.

04:30.036 --> 04:32.504
You know, like camping,
hiking, horseback riding.

04:32.672 --> 04:34.663
They do? Oh...

04:37.110 --> 04:39.271
<i>Crash through the line of blue</i>

04:39.445 --> 04:41.709
<i>And send the backs on 'round the end</i>

04:41.881 --> 04:43.906
<i>Fight, fight
For every yard.</i>

04:44.083 --> 04:46.517
<i>Princeton's honor to defend.
Rah-rah-rah!</i>

04:49.155 --> 04:51.282
<i>Throw you hands up</i>

04:51.457 --> 04:55.587
<i>If you wanna be down
So come on</i>

04:59.032 --> 05:01.523
<i>Rah-rah-rah</i>

05:02.135 --> 05:06.128
Oh, look, here's my old Princeton beanie.

05:10.176 --> 05:12.508
It fits perfectly.

05:12.679 --> 05:16.376
Oh, God, it's been a long hard struggle,
son, but you made it.

05:16.549 --> 05:18.847
It sure has.
But I know it's not gonna be easy.

05:19.018 --> 05:20.076
Oh, you're damn right.

05:20.253 --> 05:22.983
You're gonna finally find out
the meaning of competition.

05:23.156 --> 05:26.592
Because at Princeton,
they separate the wheat from the chaff.

05:26.759 --> 05:30.024
But you're ready. You're gonna be
a part of the crème de la crème.

05:30.196 --> 05:33.597
So I guess that makes Pokey here
the crème of wheat.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.235
This is gonna be a big change for you.

05:37.403 --> 05:40.668
From now on,
it's just gonna be work, work, work.

05:41.441 --> 05:42.931
Boy, boy, boy.

05:43.109 --> 05:45.634
This crate sure brings back
a lot of memories.

05:45.812 --> 05:48.178
Oh, look, my old trophy.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.509
The yearbook. Heh, heh.

05:50.817 --> 05:54.446
What's this? A Twinkie.

05:56.589 --> 05:59.990
I just dug this out of the attic because
I thought maybe you'd wanna go through it.

06:00.159 --> 06:01.854
- Ha-ha-ha.
Rah-rah-rah!

06:05.998 --> 06:07.431
Man.

06:08.034 --> 06:10.093
Oh. A Afro pick.

06:10.837 --> 06:13.169
I wonder who this belonged to.

06:13.673 --> 06:16.164
Hey, look,
it's Dad's Phi Beta Kappa key.

06:16.342 --> 06:20.278
Man, look, defensive player of the year.

06:20.813 --> 06:22.713
Wow, look at all this stuff.

06:22.882 --> 06:27.751
Valedictorian, voted most popular,
captain of the debating team.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.889
Yo, Uncle Phil was just straight up
the man around that joint.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.456
Oh, my God.

06:32.625 --> 06:35.594
He's shaking hands
with President Johnson.

06:36.162 --> 06:38.153
Will, I don't know if I can do this.

06:38.631 --> 06:42.658
I don't think you wanna be shaking hands
with President Johnson right now.

06:42.835 --> 06:46.828
That's not what I mean. I mean, I knew Dad
was, you know a big deal and everything...

06:47.006 --> 06:49.201
...but my God, how do you follow this?

06:50.476 --> 06:52.205
Carlton, what are you talking about?

06:52.378 --> 06:54.471
Well, as hard as I work
and as well as I do...

06:54.647 --> 06:58.481
...the best that I'll ever be
is not quite as good as Dad.

06:58.651 --> 07:02.417
I don't know if I can do this.
I don't know if I could ever fill Dad's shoes.

07:02.588 --> 07:06.251
I don't know
if I could ever be good enough.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.156
Hey, hey, come on. Carlton, man.

07:09.328 --> 07:14.459
I mean, I know this might be a bad time,
but you got some spare change?

07:19.238 --> 07:23.004
Hey, look, Carlton, we're in a public place,
man. Now don't embarrass me.

07:25.611 --> 07:27.943
Get out of here before I hurt you, girl.

07:28.114 --> 07:29.376
- Hey.
- Can I help you?

07:29.549 --> 07:34.043
Yeah. We'll take a size 12
and a three and a half.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.847
- Six and a half.
- Oh.

07:38.591 --> 07:39.683
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

07:39.859 --> 07:41.827
These look like
they've been worn before.

07:43.329 --> 07:45.422
Carlton, take the shoes and come on.

07:45.598 --> 07:47.225
Fine.

08:43.356 --> 08:46.257
Oh, C, man,
you came up with the quickness.

08:46.425 --> 08:49.360
I did, didn't I? I mean,
for the first time out, I wasn't bad.

08:49.529 --> 08:52.430
Dude, you rolled a 130. That's good.
You know what that means?

08:52.598 --> 08:55.658
- That I'm a natural?
- No. You gotta buy lunch.

08:56.068 --> 08:57.330
Huh?

09:00.973 --> 09:03.066
Here is the church.

09:03.242 --> 09:05.233
Here is the steeple.

09:05.411 --> 09:07.606
Open the door and...

09:07.780 --> 09:10.010
Where are all the people?

09:10.516 --> 09:12.484
This is so boring.

09:12.652 --> 09:13.949
Yeah.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.020
Well, what do you want me to do?

09:16.188 --> 09:19.646
<i>Nature walk, nature walk, nature walk.</i>

09:19.825 --> 09:21.315
Hey, hey, hey.

09:21.494 --> 09:23.189
What's all the noise, Big Birds?

09:23.362 --> 09:27.560
It's not Big Birds, Big Ears.
It's Blue Birds.

09:28.568 --> 09:33.005
Big Ears. That's funny. I'm gonna remember
that when cookie time roll around.

09:33.272 --> 09:36.867
Hey, Hil, could you do me a favor
and get your flock out of here.

09:37.043 --> 09:38.271
Very funny.

09:38.444 --> 09:41.777
But we're leaving.
We're going on a nature walk.

09:42.114 --> 09:44.981
Geoffrey,
can you give us a ride to nature?

09:48.654 --> 09:51.885
Hey, Uncle Phil, who is this rough-Iooking
brother standing next to you?

09:52.058 --> 09:54.618
Heh, heh. That's your Aunt Viv.

09:59.332 --> 10:02.699
Yeah, uh, her facial hair was different
back then.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.937
Why didn't anyone remind me
that I hate children?

10:08.107 --> 10:09.836
My God, Hilary, what happened to you?

10:10.009 --> 10:13.103
I went on a nature walk
with those little blue people.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.337
It was awful.

10:14.513 --> 10:17.539
We were startled by a deer,
swarmed by butterflies.

10:17.717 --> 10:20.345
And I have such a headache
from that babbling brook.

10:22.254 --> 10:23.915
- Hey, hey.
Hey.

10:24.090 --> 10:26.752
The Princeton man. Ha-ha-ha.

10:26.926 --> 10:29.326
Son, I just signed
a check for your first year's tuition.

10:29.495 --> 10:31.622
Thought I'd give you the honor
of mailing it.

10:31.797 --> 10:33.059
Oh, I won't be needing it.

10:33.232 --> 10:36.463
Oh, my God. You got a scholarship.
I didn't even know you had applied.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.103
This is wonderful news.

10:38.270 --> 10:40.795
It's not that,
but I do have wonderful news.

10:40.973 --> 10:43.874
What, the adapter for your inflatable doll
came in?

10:44.977 --> 10:49.607
- So, what's the wonderful news?
- Dad, I've decided not to attend Princeton.

10:50.483 --> 10:54.044
Oh, after all you've been through,
you've decided to stay at ULA, huh?

10:54.220 --> 10:55.619
- No.
- Okay.

10:55.788 --> 11:00.350
You're not going to ULA. You're not going
to Princeton. What the hell are you doing?

11:00.526 --> 11:01.686
I'm gonna be a bowler.

11:08.801 --> 11:14.137
Oh, so you're going to bowl?
Ha-ha-ha.

11:14.306 --> 11:18.003
Well, that's very different.
You certainly don't need Princeton for that.

11:19.145 --> 11:21.579
There you go.
I knew you'd be supportive.

11:21.747 --> 11:24.341
Supportive. Just what...?
Are you out of your mind?

11:24.517 --> 11:28.510
- Are you out of your mind?
- Will, I'll handle this.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.054
Are you out of your mind?

11:31.824 --> 11:35.851
Just because I'm not gonna do
what you want me to do, you're angry?

11:36.028 --> 11:40.192
For the first time in my life, I'm standing on
my own two feet filling my own two shoes.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.459
And not just being
what you want me to be.

11:42.635 --> 11:43.966
What are you talking about?

11:44.136 --> 11:46.969
I have never stopped you
from being what you wanna be.

11:47.773 --> 11:50.606
- That ain't exactly true, Uncle Phil...
- Shut up, Will.

11:52.011 --> 11:53.603
This is my decision.

11:53.779 --> 11:56.771
I finally found something I'm good at
that I like, and that's it.

11:56.949 --> 11:58.576
- You're gonna bowl?
- I'm gonna bowl.

11:58.751 --> 11:59.775
- Fine.
- Fine?

11:59.952 --> 12:01.112
Fine.

12:03.989 --> 12:07.254
Your son is about to throw his life away
and all you can say is "fine"?

12:07.426 --> 12:11.089
If I stop him from bowling, I will be doing
exactly what he's accusing me of.

12:12.164 --> 12:15.099
He just needs a little space.
He will get over this.

12:15.267 --> 12:17.895
Uncle Phil, I think we need to nip this thing
in the bud.

12:18.070 --> 12:20.470
Oh, it's just a phase, Will. Just a phase.

12:20.940 --> 12:22.999
Just a phase?

12:23.576 --> 12:26.943
We worked our fingers to the bone
to put him through school.

12:28.447 --> 12:31.905
He's about to throw it away and
I'm the only one who wants to do anything?

12:33.586 --> 12:37.886
It is a sad, sad day when Will Smith
becomes the voice of reason.

12:43.963 --> 12:46.158
I said stop it!

12:46.332 --> 12:47.390
Stop that!

12:47.566 --> 12:51.161
Oh, Geoffrey, who am I kidding?
I can't do any of this.

12:51.337 --> 12:53.828
I've even heard rumblings
that I'm not any fun.

12:54.006 --> 12:55.667
Nonsense, Miss Hilary.

12:55.841 --> 12:59.140
Now, Master Carlton, he's no fun.

12:59.311 --> 13:01.779
But you're a splendid young lady
with a lot to offer.

13:01.947 --> 13:04.415
If you just pick something you like
and are good at...

13:04.583 --> 13:07.017
...those girls will have a wonderful time
with you.

13:08.020 --> 13:11.717
- Geoffrey, do you really mean that?
- No. It just seemed the right thing to say.

13:20.466 --> 13:22.457
We gotta talk, boy.

13:26.138 --> 13:30.632
- Will you excuse us for a second, please?
- See you later, Pins.

13:31.477 --> 13:34.412
Pins? What is that short for, pinhead?

13:34.580 --> 13:35.808
No, it is not.

13:36.248 --> 13:39.581
What happened to the guy whose
biggest dream was to go to Princeton?

13:39.752 --> 13:41.947
Look,
I used to have a lot of dreams, Will.

13:42.121 --> 13:46.057
I used to dream that I was being chased
by hot dogs and doughnuts.

13:46.225 --> 13:49.092
But it's just a dream.
It means nothing. This is reality.

13:49.261 --> 13:51.456
Carlton, this isn't reality. This is stupid.

13:51.630 --> 13:53.962
Will, my dad supports me.
Why can't you?

13:54.733 --> 13:56.257
Your dad isn't thinking straight.

13:56.435 --> 13:59.632
The man's hopped up
on a 25-year-old Twinkie.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.565
Will, you're just wasting your time.

14:02.741 --> 14:04.936
You don't wanna bowl.
You wanna go to Princeton.

14:05.110 --> 14:07.670
No. My dad wants me to go to Princeton,
I wanna bowl.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.645
You wanna go to Princeton,
but you're just afraid.

14:10.816 --> 14:14.115
Oh, I see what this is.

14:14.286 --> 14:17.687
Will, you're suffering from Pins envy.

14:18.324 --> 14:22.055
Carlton, me envious of you?

14:22.461 --> 14:25.396
Oh, I see it, Will.
I mean, why shouldn't you be?

14:25.564 --> 14:27.725
I'm going to be a professional athlete.

14:27.900 --> 14:29.993
Professional?
Carlton, you can't even beat me.

14:30.169 --> 14:31.329
Ha!

14:31.503 --> 14:34.404
Okay. Let's have a match.
Just you and me.

14:34.573 --> 14:35.801
Oh, okay.

14:35.975 --> 14:39.706
You win, do what you wanna do. I win,
you gonna take your butt to Princeton.

14:40.246 --> 14:41.508
Now, that's stupid.

14:41.680 --> 14:43.614
What?
You a little chicken there, bro?

14:47.286 --> 14:49.982
Oh, go ahead. Teach him a lesson, Pins.

14:50.656 --> 14:54.888
And by the way,
I have a coffee break in 15 minutes.

14:56.929 --> 14:58.556
Okay.

15:00.266 --> 15:02.097
You're on.

15:10.943 --> 15:11.967
Phew.

15:16.015 --> 15:19.576
Well, well, well.
I'm surprised you showed.

15:21.220 --> 15:23.552
Why don't you just save yourself
the embarrassment?

15:23.722 --> 15:25.713
Go home, start getting packed
for Princeton.

15:25.891 --> 15:30.351
Oh, yeah?
Well, why don't I not and say I did?

15:32.231 --> 15:37.191
Well, it looks like we
don't need to do no more talking.

15:37.369 --> 15:38.836
Let's just grab our balls.

17:11.030 --> 17:15.830
Whoa. Looks like I just need three pins
to win and there's four standing up there.

17:16.001 --> 17:18.696
I've got three-out-of-four chance.
Bye-bye.

17:19.704 --> 17:21.229
<i>Crash through the line of blue</i>

17:21.406 --> 17:23.671
<i>And send the backs on 'round the end</i>

17:25.144 --> 17:27.169
I love it.

17:42.795 --> 17:44.660
Wait a... All right. Wait a minute.

17:44.830 --> 17:47.492
My shoe. My shoe... My shoe stuck.

17:47.666 --> 17:50.464
But... That's a do-over.
That's not... No, hold up.

17:50.636 --> 17:52.627
No, that's a do-over. That's... No.

17:52.805 --> 17:55.672
Somebody paged me right when I went...

17:55.841 --> 17:59.242
Right when I was... Right when I was
doing this, somebody paged me.

18:03.882 --> 18:06.350
Hilary, how's it going
with your little Blue Birds?

18:06.518 --> 18:10.648
Terrific. We finally found something
that we can really connect on.

18:10.823 --> 18:13.621
Where are they?
Come on, girls. Hurry it up.

18:13.792 --> 18:17.421
Last one in the sauna
is gonna get clogged pores.

18:28.507 --> 18:30.873
Hey, Uncle Phil.

18:31.577 --> 18:33.841
That Carlton's gonna be
some bowler, huh?

18:34.012 --> 18:36.810
Oh, Will.
Carlton's not gonna be a bowler.

18:36.982 --> 18:41.009
It's just a phase. He is not gonna
throw his life away bowling. Heh, heh.

18:41.186 --> 18:43.154
- He's not?
- Like I said...

18:43.322 --> 18:46.450
...the best thing we can do
is just to steer clear of him.

18:46.992 --> 18:49.756
Uh-huh. Okay. Well, see...

18:49.928 --> 18:52.396
...I kind of took a different approach.

18:52.564 --> 18:56.159
I kind of, like, steered right at him,
you know what I'm saying?

18:56.335 --> 19:00.066
I think I may have strengthened his resolve
to throw his whole life away.

19:00.239 --> 19:04.471
But I just wanna say to you, I don't think
that should affect our relationship.

19:06.745 --> 19:08.212
What are you talking about?

19:08.614 --> 19:14.575
Oh, so you need further elaboration.
Well, see, Uncle Phil, now, you know...

19:14.753 --> 19:18.052
...I know I can beat Carlton at any sport,
right?

19:18.223 --> 19:22.057
But then I had found out
bowling ain't no sport. Shh.

19:22.227 --> 19:24.320
You know,
so Carlton's not going to Princeton.

19:24.496 --> 19:27.988
He's going to join the PBA. I'm gonna go get
a grub, want me to make you something?

19:28.167 --> 19:32.103
Will, I find out that you contributed
to my son not going to Princeton...

19:32.271 --> 19:34.398
...you will be picking
my shoe leather out of...

19:34.573 --> 19:37.133
- Hi, y'all.
- Hey. Look, it's Pins.

19:37.776 --> 19:40.210
Son, I think it's about time
we had a little talk.

19:40.379 --> 19:42.006
Oh, I think we should.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.547
You're darn skippy, we should.

19:45.717 --> 19:48.151
You're darn skippy y'all should.

19:52.424 --> 19:55.484
Carlton, you're right.

19:55.661 --> 19:58.323
It's always been my dream
for you to go to Princeton.

19:58.497 --> 20:00.260
But it's been yours also.

20:00.432 --> 20:01.763
I never pushed you.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.196
I know.

20:03.602 --> 20:05.763
I just freaked out.

20:06.271 --> 20:10.139
When I got accepted and you brought down
that box of achievements...

20:10.309 --> 20:13.472
...I just realized
that I could never measure up to you.

20:14.546 --> 20:16.036
I got scared.

20:17.049 --> 20:20.507
Son, this is not a competition.

20:20.686 --> 20:25.089
And it's perfectly natural for you to feel
the pressure and get mixed up and start...

20:25.257 --> 20:26.349
...bowling.

20:27.359 --> 20:33.958
But bowling never solves anything,
it just makes things worse.

20:34.933 --> 20:36.525
Oh, I know that now.

20:36.702 --> 20:41.503
Oh, sure, it offered a quick high, cheap
thrills and fast women, but who wants that?

20:44.843 --> 20:46.367
I'm a Princeton man.

20:47.846 --> 20:52.408
Son, I have always been proud
of your achievements.

20:52.584 --> 20:55.985
The only question in my mind
is if Princeton is good enough for you.

20:56.154 --> 20:58.918
Yeah? Do you think
I should hold out for Harvard?

20:59.091 --> 21:00.581
No.

21:01.460 --> 21:02.518
Listen.

21:02.694 --> 21:05.595
There are always gonna be things
that I'm better at than you...

21:05.764 --> 21:07.595
...and you'll be better at than I am.

21:08.533 --> 21:09.898
Oh, you mean like bowling.

21:12.838 --> 21:15.966
Well, I'm sure there are a lot of things,
but bowling?

21:16.141 --> 21:19.008
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Not bowling.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.377
Dad, I can beat you at bowling.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.144
You want a piece of me?
