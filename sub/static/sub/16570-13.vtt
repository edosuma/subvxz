00:28.178 --> 00:31.011
Hey, honey,
I brought you some doughnuts.

00:31.881 --> 00:33.473
Ooh! Doughnuts?

00:37.220 --> 00:39.552
Coffee first. Coffee first.

00:45.195 --> 00:47.527
Where? Where are the doughnuts?

00:49.165 --> 00:51.030
Actually...

00:52.702 --> 00:54.192
Ah!

01:00.710 --> 01:03.042
- What is that?
- What does it look like?

01:03.213 --> 01:05.704
A kitten. For me?

01:05.882 --> 01:09.283
Oh, Fritzi, you can't...
You can't buy a pet for someone else.

01:09.452 --> 01:10.612
I didn't buy him.

01:10.787 --> 01:12.311
He's a rescue.

01:15.158 --> 01:16.591
Well, he's...

01:17.594 --> 01:20.028
All right, he's cute.
But, look, I'm not ready for...

01:20.196 --> 01:23.893
Did you hear that, Joel?
She thinks you're cute.

01:24.667 --> 01:29.229
"Joel"? You named the cat Joel?

01:29.405 --> 01:33.205
I didn't even get to help pick him out.
And Kitty can't be replaced like this.

01:33.376 --> 01:36.277
I know that. Joel is not Kitty.

01:41.417 --> 01:43.908
You can't call a cat Joel.
Cats are not called Joel.

01:44.087 --> 01:47.818
- They're called things like Dasher or Dancer.
- Those are reindeer.

01:48.558 --> 01:50.651
Look, your last cat
didn't have a name at all.

01:51.661 --> 01:54.152
Hey, we can call him something else
if you want to.

01:54.564 --> 01:55.588
Deputy Chief Johnson.

01:56.366 --> 02:00.132
Yes, detective sergeant?
Hang on, Sergeant Gabriel. Just...

02:00.503 --> 02:03.165
Hang on just one second.

02:03.339 --> 02:06.331
Look, I appreciate the sentiment. I do.

02:06.509 --> 02:13.506
I'm just not ready to start over again
with another pet. So goodbye, Joel.

02:16.052 --> 02:17.679
Sorry.

02:18.488 --> 02:20.456
Bye, now. Bye.

02:21.958 --> 02:23.789
Yes, sergeant?

02:31.334 --> 02:33.131
Hey there.

02:48.451 --> 02:51.887
- What the...? Jeez.
- For heaven's sakes.

02:53.423 --> 02:55.584
What does L.A. have in store for us today?

02:55.758 --> 02:58.022
I wish I could say, "The usual."

02:58.194 --> 03:00.219
I'm giving the grand tour. Come on.

03:00.396 --> 03:01.954
Thank you.

03:02.599 --> 03:05.295
Neighbors say this house
has been sitting empty for a year.

03:05.468 --> 03:10.064
But a few members of the Tres Colores
have taken it over as a party spot.

03:12.408 --> 03:14.342
Watch the puke, chief.

03:16.045 --> 03:17.979
Come this way, please.

03:27.757 --> 03:30.555
Yeah, the gangs keep recruiting them
younger and younger.

03:30.727 --> 03:34.128
Yeah. We keep getting older and older.

03:37.500 --> 03:39.934
He had a fight with the fiancÃ©e again
last night.

03:40.103 --> 03:41.730
Hope it's the last one.

03:44.374 --> 03:45.705
Time of death?

03:47.710 --> 03:49.610
- Time of death?
- Time of death, yes.

03:49.779 --> 03:51.474
Midnight, give or take an hour.

03:51.648 --> 03:56.779
- Sorry. I never get used to the young ones.
- Yeah, well, neither do we.

04:00.189 --> 04:04.888
Chief, the kid was shot over here
three times in the gut...

04:05.061 --> 04:11.022
...pukes, then crawls
to where he finally bleeds out...

04:11.200 --> 04:13.361
...right here.

04:18.808 --> 04:20.332
His fingertip's gone.

04:20.510 --> 04:23.411
Yeah, found it stuck
to the wall. Shot clean off.

04:23.579 --> 04:27.811
Probably had his hand out front,
just giving up.

04:27.984 --> 04:29.918
So close range.

04:30.086 --> 04:34.489
Based on the outfit and the location,
I mean, this kid wanted to be a gangster.

04:34.657 --> 04:38.423
But he's a little young.
And look at his tattoo.

04:42.165 --> 04:45.601
A wannabe. Buzz,
make sure you get a shot of that, please.

04:45.768 --> 04:48.794
So, what, do you think
this is the first round in a gang war?

04:48.972 --> 04:50.269
It takes a lot of cojones...

04:50.440 --> 04:54.171
...to walk through the front door
in hostile territory and shoot a kid.

05:01.017 --> 05:02.314
Does our victim have a name?

05:02.485 --> 05:05.852
No wallet, no ID,
but we're pretty sure his name is Manuel.

05:06.022 --> 05:08.582
We got a 911 call from a payphone.

05:08.758 --> 05:12.717
A male voice said a Manuel
was shot to death at this address.

05:12.895 --> 05:15.693
I mean, the kid's not even 12.

05:15.865 --> 05:18.026
Does anybody know
the nearest middle school?

05:18.201 --> 05:19.862
Taft or Harding.

05:20.036 --> 05:23.369
Yeah, and there's a Catholic school
a couple of blocks south from here:

05:23.539 --> 05:26.303
Saint something,
or Our Lady of whatever.

05:26.476 --> 05:30.139
Get all their yearbooks, see if you can get
a photo that matches up to our boy.

05:30.313 --> 05:34.044
Find out Manuel's last name so we can
make a notification to his parents.

05:34.217 --> 05:39.553
Then maybe we could learn more about him
than the fact that he likes gum.

05:42.392 --> 05:44.121
Strawberry.

05:44.293 --> 05:46.420
Pukey strawberry.

05:55.304 --> 05:57.670
The dead kid is Manuel. Manuel Soto.

05:57.840 --> 06:00.638
Twelve years old.
Went to Harding Middle School.

06:00.810 --> 06:02.539
No sports, no honor roll...

06:02.712 --> 06:05.374
...but according to the principal,
he wasn't much trouble.

06:05.548 --> 06:07.379
- Yeah, yet.
- What do you mean, "yet"?

06:07.550 --> 06:09.450
Well, Manuel Soto
comes from a bad family.

06:09.619 --> 06:13.419
His father did 11 years for stabbing a guy,
and his big brother is Cruz Soto.

06:13.589 --> 06:16.990
Who's doing seven years at Pelican Bay
for assault, battery...

06:17.160 --> 06:19.321
...and possession
of a fully automatic weapon.

06:19.495 --> 06:22.089
He's the guy that used to run
the Tres Colores, right?

06:22.265 --> 06:25.496
Oh, we think he still does.
Only, now he's doing it from prison.

06:25.668 --> 06:27.659
Has his first parole hearing in a month.

06:29.338 --> 06:32.102
So Cruz Soto's little brother
gets shot to death...

06:32.275 --> 06:36.268
...right in the middle of Three C's territory.
Someone's making quite a statement.

06:36.446 --> 06:38.311
Well, if this is a gang war, chief...

06:38.481 --> 06:41.507
...shooting a young boy like this
is way over the line.

06:41.684 --> 06:45.120
- It's going to get ugly.
- All right. I'll put a call in to Pelican Bay...

06:45.288 --> 06:48.951
...get Cruz moved into isolation
so he can't send out any orders...

06:49.125 --> 06:51.320
...or get any info from the outside.

06:51.494 --> 06:52.961
Okay. Thank you, commander.

06:53.129 --> 06:56.064
In other news, SID sent over print reports
from the house.

06:56.232 --> 06:58.223
Two matches. Known Three C's.

06:58.401 --> 07:03.361
One of them is Rafael Mendez,
a.k.a. Sniper.

07:03.906 --> 07:08.639
And the other one,
name's Felix Vega, a.k.a. Stank.

07:08.811 --> 07:11.075
Anyway, we got some partials
we haven't been able...

07:11.247 --> 07:12.544
...to match up with anything yet.

07:12.715 --> 07:15.548
And we're still processing
the rest of the garbage.

07:15.718 --> 07:18.744
Okay, so these gentlemen,
Stank and Sniper...

07:18.921 --> 07:22.220
...are either suspects or witnesses.
Lieutenant Flynn and Provenza...

07:22.391 --> 07:25.326
...bring them in so we can have a little chat.
Lieutenant Tao...

07:25.495 --> 07:28.760
...get search warrants for their homes,
see if a 9 mm handgun turns up.

07:28.931 --> 07:32.059
Detective Sergeant Gabriel
and Detective Sanchez, with me, please.

07:32.235 --> 07:34.294
We get to notify Manuel's parents.

07:34.470 --> 07:36.097
Thank you.

07:40.910 --> 07:42.605
<i>Senor Soto.</i>

07:51.120 --> 07:53.350
Sir, you're going to have
to secure that dog.

08:06.202 --> 08:07.191
<i>Gracias.</i>

08:07.937 --> 08:09.700
It's open.

08:19.081 --> 08:21.276
Is Mrs. Soto around?

08:21.450 --> 08:22.747
Not for eight years.

08:22.919 --> 08:25.581
Sir, is there anyone else in this house?

08:25.788 --> 08:28.723
Sir, is there anyone else here?

08:36.164 --> 08:38.827
We're looking for
your son Manuel. Is he around?

08:39.402 --> 08:40.869
No.

08:41.037 --> 08:42.629
What's this about?

08:42.804 --> 08:45.467
- Did Manuel sleep here last night?
- Nope.

08:45.641 --> 08:48.735
- When was the last time you spoke to him?
- He called yesterday.

08:48.911 --> 08:52.074
Said he was spending the night
at a friend's house.

08:52.782 --> 08:55.649
Mr. Soto, would you please sit down, sir?

09:11.067 --> 09:14.195
Sir, I'm very sorry to have to tell you this,
but we found Manuel...

09:14.370 --> 09:16.634
...and he had been shot to death.

09:17.840 --> 09:20.604
I understand this is terrible news,
but we're here to help.

09:25.581 --> 09:26.707
I don't need your help.

09:28.050 --> 09:30.041
Well, I apologize, but we need yours.

09:31.721 --> 09:34.781
Any idea who would wanna
do this to Manuel?

09:35.625 --> 09:37.559
- Was he in a gang?
- No.

09:37.727 --> 09:40.457
- He wasn't ready.
- He had a Tres Colores tattoo.

09:44.066 --> 09:45.795
Like this one?

09:47.336 --> 09:52.399
Hey, I hear the city gives you $2000
for a funeral, right?

09:56.612 --> 09:59.342
- When can I get that money?
- We'll look into it.

09:59.515 --> 10:01.745
What about your other son, Cruz?

10:01.917 --> 10:05.284
I understand he's in prison
and one of the top leaders of the Three C's.

10:05.454 --> 10:08.514
Maybe a rival gang was trying
to intimidate him by hurting Manuel?

10:13.996 --> 10:16.487
I think I hear my dog.

10:18.968 --> 10:22.995
Mr. Soto said his son called on his cell.
But there was no phone on Manuel.

10:23.172 --> 10:26.039
I'll check with all the carriers
and see if he has an account.

10:26.208 --> 10:28.836
Thank you.
And let's see to it our father of the year...

10:29.011 --> 10:30.876
...gets his burial money.
- Yes, ma'am.

10:31.047 --> 10:34.744
All right, thanks. Got the search warrant
on Felix Vega, a.k.a. Stank's house.

10:34.917 --> 10:36.475
Excellent.

10:57.606 --> 11:00.473
- Pardon me, Detective?
- Ranski. Hollenbeck Homicide.

11:00.643 --> 11:02.372
What on earth is going on here?

11:03.112 --> 11:07.173
- Two dead bodies in the backyard.
- Okay. Thank you. We'll take it from here.

11:07.350 --> 11:09.545
I have to talk to my watch commander
about that.

11:09.719 --> 11:12.051
Meantime, you're welcome to observe.

11:13.022 --> 11:17.982
Uh-huh. Well, that stinks. A double
homicide, probably no witnesses, I bet.

11:18.160 --> 11:20.651
How many other unsolved murders
are on your books?

11:20.830 --> 11:24.766
And if you don't solve these two, how
would that look at your year-end review?

11:25.935 --> 11:27.493
You really want these murders?

11:27.670 --> 11:31.162
Just think of it as
an early Christmas present from me to you.

11:41.984 --> 11:45.044
Casings are 9 mm,
same as the ones we found near Manuel.

11:48.958 --> 11:52.018
All right, the coroner's assistant
found a wallet on each of them.

11:52.194 --> 11:55.493
Okay, this must be Felix Vega,
a.k.a. Stank.

11:55.664 --> 11:59.100
- That's him.
- Over here, trying to run away...

11:59.268 --> 12:00.428
...must've been...

12:01.904 --> 12:04.930
Camilla Santiago.

12:05.408 --> 12:06.397
Huh?

12:08.344 --> 12:12.041
No. He doesn't look like a Camilla to me.

12:19.622 --> 12:22.182
That's a shame about
Cruz Soto's brother being murdered.

12:22.358 --> 12:25.816
But Narcotics is in the late stages
of an operation in that neighborhood.

12:25.995 --> 12:27.986
I need Major Crimes
to keep a low profile...

12:28.164 --> 12:31.531
...during the first couple days
of your investigation. What do you need?

12:31.700 --> 12:34.863
I need you to put a Crime Suppression detail
into place.

12:35.037 --> 12:36.061
Excuse me?

12:36.238 --> 12:39.571
Saturate the neighborhood with
black-and-whites, 25 or 30 extra units...

12:39.742 --> 12:40.970
...24/7 for the next week.

12:41.143 --> 12:44.044
Yeah. Yeah.
I know what a Crime Suppression detail is.

12:44.213 --> 12:47.376
It's basically the exact opposite
of what I just said I need.

12:47.550 --> 12:50.576
I have a murdered 12-year-old boy
and two dead Tres Colores.

12:50.753 --> 12:54.780
- This could be the beginning of a gang war.
- All the bodies are piling up on one side.

12:54.957 --> 12:58.518
It sounds less like a gang war,
more like an internal power struggle.

12:58.694 --> 13:00.423
Cruz Soto's been in jail a long time.

13:00.596 --> 13:03.588
Maybe his gang is not so excited
about him getting out on parole.

13:03.766 --> 13:06.826
No. From what I hear, Cruz is
completely in charge of the Three C's.

13:07.002 --> 13:09.698
Can you prove that?
According to his official record...

13:09.872 --> 13:12.932
...he's behaved so well,
that they have to let him out next month.

13:13.108 --> 13:14.507
Unless you have information...

13:14.677 --> 13:17.441
...about his little brother's murder
that I'm unaware of...

13:17.613 --> 13:20.741
I have a dead gang member
that we can put at Manuel's crime scene...

13:20.916 --> 13:24.283
...who had an ATM card in his pocket
belonging to a Camilla Santiago.

13:24.453 --> 13:27.388
Was this Camilla in a gang?
Related to a gang member?

13:27.556 --> 13:30.491
- We don't know. She's missing.
- Uh-huh.

13:30.659 --> 13:32.786
You know what this sounds like to me?

13:32.962 --> 13:37.422
A major crime. Is there any way I can help
you that won't cost thousands of dollars...

13:37.600 --> 13:40.967
...from another division
or interrupt an ongoing investigation?

13:41.136 --> 13:42.467
No.

13:43.839 --> 13:48.367
- Fine. We'll do what we can on our own.
- Thank you.

13:54.416 --> 13:56.247
- Hello?
- I called to tell you...

13:56.418 --> 14:00.377
...not to bother stopping to pick up
fresh kitty litter on your way home...

14:00.556 --> 14:02.251
...because I already got some.

14:02.424 --> 14:06.121
- Fritzi, I told you, I don't want Joel.
- I believe you.

14:06.295 --> 14:08.593
That's why I've decided
to keep him for myself.

14:08.764 --> 14:10.322
<i>- What?
- Yes.</i>

14:10.499 --> 14:12.729
Joel is no longer your kitten.

14:12.902 --> 14:16.429
He's mine. Unless you're the only one
allowed to have pets.

14:16.605 --> 14:19.039
You and Joel are trying to manipulate me.

14:19.408 --> 14:21.968
- We are not.
- You...

14:24.213 --> 14:25.441
Never mind.

14:27.516 --> 14:29.677
She's coming around.

14:57.746 --> 14:59.077
Detective Sergeant Gabriel...

14:59.248 --> 15:02.308
...please tell me we found a 9 mm handgun
at Felix Vega's home.

15:02.484 --> 15:03.974
I can't, because we didn't.

15:04.153 --> 15:08.783
But our casings jumped
to the front of the line down at Ballistics.

15:08.958 --> 15:12.121
Chief, none of the phone companies
has a number under Manuel's name.

15:12.294 --> 15:15.457
One for him...

15:15.631 --> 15:18.759
...and maybe the other for Manuel.
- Did you dump Mr. Soto's phones?

15:18.934 --> 15:21.994
Some lawyer at the phone company
says we don't have probable cause.

15:22.171 --> 15:25.766
I have a dead 12-year-old shot to bits
and two dead gang members.

15:25.941 --> 15:27.568
That's not probable cause?

15:27.743 --> 15:30.303
What about Camilla Santiago?
Any word from Surveillance?

15:30.479 --> 15:34.415
Yeah, the unit has been outside of
her apartment ever since we found the ID.

15:34.583 --> 15:36.016
But no sign of Camilla yet.

15:36.185 --> 15:38.949
And she's not answering
her home phone or her cell.

15:39.121 --> 15:41.885
But no missing-persons report
has been filed.

15:42.057 --> 15:46.016
Turns out she has used her ATM card
in the last two days, though.

15:46.195 --> 15:48.254
But it wasn't Camilla
making the withdrawals.

15:48.430 --> 15:51.194
Check out the surveillance video
from these banks.

15:51.367 --> 15:53.392
Friday night, 11:30 p.m...

15:53.569 --> 15:56.629
...this guy took out the daily max of $400
from Camilla's account.

15:57.306 --> 15:59.240
Buzz, go to the next one.

15:59.842 --> 16:01.309
Saturday, 12:07 a.m.

16:01.477 --> 16:04.241
Technically a new day.
Another $400 a couple blocks away.

16:04.413 --> 16:06.176
I need a face, lieutenant.

16:06.348 --> 16:09.215
Sunday, 11:13 a.m., same vicinity.

16:09.385 --> 16:12.081
Only, this time,
he just takes $200 from Camilla's account.

16:12.254 --> 16:14.722
Someone knew
how not to get their picture taken.

16:14.890 --> 16:16.482
Freeze that, Buzz.

16:19.328 --> 16:22.024
- Manuel Soto.
- The day before we found him dead.

16:23.232 --> 16:27.066
Buzz, what's he holding in his other hand?
Could you punch in on that, please?

16:27.670 --> 16:29.570
Cell phone.
That gets us probable cause...

16:29.738 --> 16:33.469
...with the phone company.
- We need to find Camilla Santiago now.

16:34.209 --> 16:37.736
Hello? L.A.P.D. Anybody here?

16:37.913 --> 16:39.847
- Camilla?
- L.A.P.D.

16:40.015 --> 16:42.677
- Camilla?
- Anybody here?

16:44.086 --> 16:46.884
Well, no body.

16:47.056 --> 16:48.853
At least not here, anyway.

16:49.024 --> 16:50.548
Wanna call SID again?

16:50.726 --> 16:52.318
Yeah.

17:02.738 --> 17:03.830
Hello, Sergeant Gabriel.

17:04.006 --> 17:07.942
Chief, SID found four distinct sets of prints
here in Camilla's apartment.

17:08.109 --> 17:09.634
Hold on.

17:09.811 --> 17:12.872
Yeah, hello, chief. Yeah,
we found the partial right thumbprint...

17:13.048 --> 17:15.949
...which matches Camilla's thumbprint
from her DMV records.

17:16.117 --> 17:20.145
And we have positive matches
on Felix Vega and Rafael Mendez.

17:20.321 --> 17:23.348
- They were here, chief.
- Okay. What about Manuel?

17:23.525 --> 17:26.722
Was Manuel the fourth set of prints
we found here?

17:26.895 --> 17:29.864
Chief? Chief, we don't know
who the fourth set belongs to.

17:30.032 --> 17:33.900
But I did have SID run Camilla's prints
against some of the unidentified partials...

17:34.069 --> 17:36.799
...from the Tres Colores party house.
They got a match.

17:36.972 --> 17:39.873
Wait. Are you saying
that Camilla Santiago was at the house...

17:40.042 --> 17:42.442
<i>...where Manuel was murdered?
- That's right, chief.</i>

17:42.611 --> 17:44.806
- Are they sure?
- Absolutely positive.

17:46.281 --> 17:48.715
Okay. Thank you, sergeant. Bye-bye.

17:48.884 --> 17:53.116
Chief, I got the Sotos' phone records.
Manuel called home like his father said.

17:53.555 --> 17:56.319
- Did he contact anyone after that?
- Dialed two more numbers.

17:56.492 --> 17:58.323
911. Hung up before they got connected.

17:58.494 --> 18:01.463
And the last call was to a number
with an 818 area code.

18:01.630 --> 18:03.495
Anna Santiago.

18:04.533 --> 18:07.297
- Do you want me to talk to her, chief?
- Oh, yes, please.

18:08.837 --> 18:12.500
Hello, Miss Santiago?
My name is Detective Julio Sanchez.

18:12.975 --> 18:13.999
I am with the L.A.P.D.

18:14.710 --> 18:18.407
- I am, ma'am. Ple... Listen. Please.
- No.

18:18.580 --> 18:21.105
Hello, hello.
My name's Deputy Chief Johnson.

18:21.283 --> 18:24.719
Are you related to Camilla Santiago?

18:25.454 --> 18:28.184
Okay, Miss Santiago.
Do you know where your daughter is?

18:29.024 --> 18:32.721
Ma'am, I assure you,
I am with the police department.

18:32.895 --> 18:34.385
Okay, I'll prove it to you.

18:34.563 --> 18:38.761
I'm going to send a detective
and two uniformed officers to pick you up.

18:39.735 --> 18:43.171
Okay. I'll send a black-and-white.
It'll be at your house in five minutes.

18:44.072 --> 18:46.404
Yes, ma'am. Oh, oh, oh.

18:46.575 --> 18:49.703
- Thank you. Bye. Sorry. Right.
- Thank you.

19:01.356 --> 19:04.223
Why didn't you believe
Detective Sanchez was a police officer?

19:04.393 --> 19:06.020
People impersonate cops sometimes.

19:06.662 --> 19:09.995
<i>And why would you be concerned
about that?</i>

19:10.165 --> 19:11.257
<i>Just being careful.</i>

19:12.501 --> 19:17.097
Well, I assure you, we are the real deal.
If there's something you need to tell us...

19:17.272 --> 19:18.603
...about your daughter...
- I...

19:21.777 --> 19:23.176
There's nothing you can do.

19:24.580 --> 19:27.208
I have reason to believe
that your daughter is in danger.

19:27.382 --> 19:29.748
So if you know where she is,
please tell me.

19:29.918 --> 19:31.112
You're too late.

19:33.655 --> 19:36.215
What do you mean by that?
Did something happen?

19:36.658 --> 19:37.920
Yes.

19:38.560 --> 19:40.425
<i>But she told me no police.</i>

19:41.463 --> 19:43.590
She's been through enough.

19:43.765 --> 19:45.460
Now she wants to be left alone.

19:47.436 --> 19:48.630
So Camilla is alive?

19:50.639 --> 19:52.937
- Miss Santiago, where is she?
- Where were you?

19:53.575 --> 19:55.702
Where were you when she needed you?

19:57.246 --> 20:00.875
Several men broke into Camilla's apartment.
Two gang members had her ATM card.

20:01.049 --> 20:03.950
Now, I understand you wanna respect
your daughter's wishes...

20:04.119 --> 20:08.647
...but whoever did this
might still be looking for your daughter.

20:08.824 --> 20:11.418
So I'm going to ask you again,
where is she?

20:18.734 --> 20:22.932
She's at the Rape Treatment Center
on West Pico.

20:24.106 --> 20:26.267
- Camilla was raped?
- Yes.

20:29.745 --> 20:32.009
- I will help your daughter, I promise.
- No.

20:32.180 --> 20:33.511
You're too late.

20:47.963 --> 20:51.160
Detective Hendrix.
I'm Lieutenant Provenza.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.062
This is Deputy Chief Johnson.

20:53.235 --> 20:55.135
- Thanks for waiting.
- No problem.

20:55.304 --> 20:56.771
How's Camilla doing?

20:56.939 --> 20:59.840
Well, it's hard to say.
She's here resting, which is a start.

21:00.008 --> 21:03.671
But like I told Lieutenant Provenza,
she's traumatized, numb.

21:03.845 --> 21:06.040
I can't get her to officially report.

21:06.715 --> 21:08.444
Her mother brought her here, right?

21:09.484 --> 21:14.148
Around 2 a.m. in the morning.
Apparently Camilla didn't wanna come in.

21:14.323 --> 21:16.985
But her mother convinced her
she needed preventive care.

21:17.159 --> 21:20.128
Camilla's mom, she's tough.

21:20.295 --> 21:23.822
Even talked her daughter into letting me see
the examination results.

21:23.999 --> 21:26.024
- And what did you find?
- I promised...

21:26.201 --> 21:28.863
...I'd keep that information confidential.
- I understand.

21:29.037 --> 21:32.905
But somehow Camilla's connected to three
homicides, and we need to find out why.

21:33.075 --> 21:36.909
Detective, if your notes
just happened to be lying around...

21:37.079 --> 21:41.243
...you might want to read those to yourself
out loud.

21:41.416 --> 21:45.546
And maybe we might
just happen to overhear them.

21:54.229 --> 21:56.254
Let's see.

22:00.635 --> 22:02.933
Some scrapes. Some bruises.

22:03.105 --> 22:08.441
Right thigh, knees, cheek,
shoulders, forearms.

22:08.610 --> 22:11.078
A concussion
with temporary loss of consciousness...

22:11.246 --> 22:13.009
...which is why she was kept here.

22:14.216 --> 22:17.674
Abrasions on neck.
Significant tearing and trauma to...

22:19.388 --> 22:20.685
...both ends.

22:23.425 --> 22:26.258
And plenty of DNA evidence
should she choose to report.

22:27.496 --> 22:29.828
Okay. Thank you so much
for your help, detective.

22:29.998 --> 22:31.522
Yes. Thank you, detective.

22:31.700 --> 22:34.635
- You've been very, very helpful.
- Ma'am, where are you going?

22:34.803 --> 22:37.431
- To talk to Camilla.
- Chief, please.

22:37.606 --> 22:42.066
- Do you realize what she's been through?
- Yes, which is why I need to talk to her.

22:45.614 --> 22:47.912
I should've listened to my mother.

22:48.216 --> 22:51.652
After I moved out,
she told me not to go out late by myself.

22:51.820 --> 22:53.287
Not to shop at night.

22:53.455 --> 22:56.253
Or if I did, to always ask someone
to walk me to my car.

22:56.425 --> 22:59.792
And I'd worked late,
and I hadn't had any dinner...

23:01.329 --> 23:02.421
...and I was in a hurry.

23:02.864 --> 23:04.263
And when was this?

23:04.800 --> 23:06.734
- Friday.
- Three days ago?

23:07.869 --> 23:09.461
Now, did someone follow you home?

23:11.306 --> 23:12.864
No.

23:13.975 --> 23:17.308
He grabbed me in the parking lot
outside the grocery store.

23:18.947 --> 23:21.245
It's my fault.
I should've listened to my mom.

23:21.416 --> 23:25.648
Don't... Don't blame yourself.
I spoke to your mom.

23:25.821 --> 23:27.482
She doesn't blame you either.

23:27.656 --> 23:30.989
She just wants us to find the men
who did this to you.

23:35.263 --> 23:37.128
Now, you were in a house
on Alma Street.

23:37.299 --> 23:39.529
Do you remember
who was there with you?

23:41.236 --> 23:45.434
I don't remember anything
except running away and calling my mom.

23:45.607 --> 23:51.136
Okay. Okay, good. Let's start there.
Yeah. So you made the call to your mom.

23:51.780 --> 23:53.543
Did you make any calls after that?

23:54.416 --> 23:55.940
No.

23:56.852 --> 24:01.050
- Sure?
- Well, I was gonna call 911, but...

24:02.424 --> 24:05.416
But you hung up
before the call went through?

24:06.361 --> 24:10.024
And did you use your own phone
to make these calls, or did you?

24:11.700 --> 24:13.224
Did you borrow one from...

24:16.304 --> 24:17.464
...this boy here?

24:20.175 --> 24:21.699
No.

24:25.614 --> 24:27.343
Okay.

24:41.096 --> 24:42.495
Is that your purse?

24:53.408 --> 24:55.706
Camilla, where did you get this gun?

25:13.261 --> 25:15.092
I understand you've been through a lot.

25:15.263 --> 25:18.562
But I need you to tell me
where that gun came from.

25:20.268 --> 25:21.292
I got it from him.

25:22.437 --> 25:24.735
From that boy there in the yearbook.

25:25.974 --> 25:27.601
I got the cell phone from him too.

25:29.744 --> 25:32.008
Did he do this to you?

25:32.180 --> 25:33.875
What?

25:34.783 --> 25:36.580
No, he...

25:38.453 --> 25:42.150
He just stood guard
so I wouldn't try to escape.

25:42.657 --> 25:46.320
- But I had to get away. I had to.
- Of course you did.

25:48.463 --> 25:51.330
So it was just the two of you in that house?
You and Manuel?

25:51.733 --> 25:53.166
Yeah.

25:53.702 --> 25:57.763
The others left. Went to get some beer.

25:57.939 --> 26:01.636
And I wanted a stick of gum.

26:01.810 --> 26:04.108
I needed to get...

26:04.713 --> 26:06.180
...the taste out of my mouth.

26:08.283 --> 26:14.813
So I asked Manuel to bring me my purse.
And he did. He...

26:14.990 --> 26:18.426
He came closer.
He sat right across from me.

26:20.562 --> 26:23.030
And I told him he could have a piece too
if he wanted.

26:24.032 --> 26:26.262
Then he smiled at me.

26:27.602 --> 26:32.164
And he put the gun down
to unwrap his gum, and I grabbed it.

26:32.807 --> 26:34.934
I got the gun, and I...

26:36.611 --> 26:39.478
I think I shot him. I shot him.

26:39.648 --> 26:43.778
And I just ran as fast as I could.
I had to get out of there.

26:44.619 --> 26:46.985
I had to run away
before everybody came back.

26:53.094 --> 26:55.119
Do any of these men
look familiar to you?

26:57.232 --> 27:00.292
Were any of these men with you
in the house on Alma Street?

27:07.242 --> 27:08.402
Good.

27:08.576 --> 27:11.511
Now, which one of them abducted you
outside the grocery store?

27:12.213 --> 27:13.237
He's not here.

27:15.550 --> 27:17.541
The one with the crooked eye,
he's not here.

27:17.719 --> 27:21.985
So there was another man with you
in that house with a bad eye?

27:25.360 --> 27:26.520
Okay.

27:26.695 --> 27:29.357
Now, I know that this is difficult...

27:30.699 --> 27:31.996
...but which man raped you?

27:36.805 --> 27:38.534
All of them.

27:45.347 --> 27:46.974
I pulled all known Three C's...

27:47.148 --> 27:49.776
...with anything physically distinctive
about their eyes.

27:49.951 --> 27:52.010
One guy floated to the top.

27:52.987 --> 27:57.890
Zico Belgado, a.k.a. Pescado.

27:58.059 --> 28:00.994
Now, SID matched Pescado
with some of the partial prints...

28:01.162 --> 28:04.029
...pulled from the party house
and Camilla's apartment.

28:04.199 --> 28:06.861
Excuse me. Taylor says
you got Manuel Soto's murderer?

28:07.035 --> 28:09.799
No, no, no.
We only found the person who killed him.

28:09.971 --> 28:12.963
- What did I just say?
- Camilla Santiago shot Manuel.

28:13.141 --> 28:15.473
She was trying
to keep from being gang-raped again.

28:15.643 --> 28:18.635
I hardly think
she should be considered a murderer.

28:20.248 --> 28:23.445
Okay, so justifiable homicide.

28:23.618 --> 28:27.019
Any of the other suspects in her assault
still out there?

28:27.188 --> 28:30.988
Two of the men have been shot to death,
and one we're still looking for.

28:31.159 --> 28:33.491
The casings we picked up
at Manuel's crime scene...

28:33.661 --> 28:35.561
...definitely came from Camilla's gun.

28:35.730 --> 28:39.131
Okay. What about the other casings
found next to Stank and Sniper?

28:39.300 --> 28:41.165
From another gun altogether.

28:41.703 --> 28:45.764
So there's some other shooter out there
picking off the guys who raped Camilla?

28:45.940 --> 28:49.842
- Which is why we need to find Pescado.
- Well, I know how.

28:50.011 --> 28:54.539
We just sit here and wait for the phone
to ring. He'll turn up dead soon enough.

28:56.050 --> 28:58.484
Get some copies of Pescado's mugshot.

28:58.653 --> 29:01.713
I can get you 10 more units
in that neighborhood to help find him.

29:01.890 --> 29:05.485
Really? Sure it won't screw up
your big Narcotics investigation?

29:06.194 --> 29:08.094
No, I am not.

29:08.530 --> 29:09.622
Hey, chief.

29:10.532 --> 29:14.491
If this whole thing is revenge
for what happened to Camilla...

29:14.869 --> 29:17.770
...you think there's a chance
it's the mom pulling the trigger?

29:17.939 --> 29:21.306
I'll tell you, if it was my daughter,
I'd think about it.

29:21.476 --> 29:24.877
Hm. Did Camilla have a boyfriend?

29:25.046 --> 29:27.776
- Or an ex?
- No.

29:28.249 --> 29:29.341
What about a brother?

29:32.754 --> 29:36.281
No. Camilla didn't have a brother,
but I know someone who did...

29:36.458 --> 29:41.122
...and he's a model prisoner
about to make parole.

30:00.782 --> 30:03.182
- Oh. Detective Ranski.
- Hi.

30:03.351 --> 30:06.752
We just wanted to thank you again
for taking those murders off our hands.

30:06.921 --> 30:09.321
And we, uh...

30:09.657 --> 30:13.718
- Actually, I got you a little something.
- Oh, my favorite.

30:13.895 --> 30:16.921
- Thanks. You didn't have to...
- Oh, no, don't worry about it.

30:17.098 --> 30:19.726
Don't worry about it. Please.

30:20.702 --> 30:23.262
So listen, uh, I was thinking...

30:23.438 --> 30:26.430
...if you're free some night,
maybe we could get a little dinner.

30:26.608 --> 30:31.238
Oh, detective, I'm married. Married.

30:32.080 --> 30:33.513
I know.

30:34.482 --> 30:36.211
It's just dinner.

30:37.752 --> 30:41.415
Oh, thank God. I mean, thank you.

30:42.323 --> 30:44.484
For the chocolates.

30:45.460 --> 30:49.726
Really, I have to... I can't...
You have to go.

30:49.898 --> 30:51.331
Bye.

30:59.841 --> 31:02.833
- Hello? Deputy Chief Johnson.
- I'm surprised to hear your voice.

31:03.011 --> 31:07.107
You haven't been answering the phone
or returning any of my calls.

31:07.282 --> 31:10.308
Oh, right. Sorry about that.
I had a long night.

31:10.485 --> 31:12.612
Really? Or are you just avoiding me?

31:13.955 --> 31:15.820
And Joel.

31:16.424 --> 31:22.522
- Look, does he really have to be called that?
- Is he my cat or yours?

31:22.697 --> 31:24.358
You...

31:27.168 --> 31:30.296
Joel misses you. He's purring.
Can you hear that?

31:31.072 --> 31:33.905
Well, tell Joel I slept here last night...

31:34.075 --> 31:37.602
...because I had a 12-year-old
murder victim in the morning...

31:38.212 --> 31:41.773
...my two primary suspects turned up dead
in the afternoon, and last night...

31:41.950 --> 31:46.751
...when I found the killer, turned out she'd
been gang-raped for the last three days.

31:48.656 --> 31:51.648
Well, I'm not telling Joel any of that.
He's still just a kitten.

31:51.826 --> 31:56.263
Hey, can I bring you some fresh clothes
or breakfast?

31:56.431 --> 31:58.058
<i>- What can I do?
- No.</i>

31:58.232 --> 32:00.632
Right now,
just hearing your voice is enough.

32:03.504 --> 32:06.871
So how is Joel adjusting?

32:07.909 --> 32:10.309
I think very well.

32:21.623 --> 32:24.524
- She broke off the engagement, huh?
- Yep.

32:25.059 --> 32:26.083
I'm old...

32:27.261 --> 32:28.558
...and I'm all alone.

32:29.897 --> 32:35.130
Well, as usual, you're only half-right.

32:35.303 --> 32:37.134
You're pretty old.

32:38.606 --> 32:43.407
Come on. Look at it this way:
You finally broke the cycle.

32:44.345 --> 32:47.781
No divorce, and you don't have to wear
the clothes she made you buy.

32:47.949 --> 32:50.509
You can skip right past
feeling sorry for yourself...

32:50.685 --> 32:55.145
And move right on to hatred...

32:55.323 --> 32:57.291
...anger...

32:58.926 --> 33:00.723
...resentment.

33:05.900 --> 33:08.630
Okay. Anyone turned up anything
on Pescado yet?

33:08.803 --> 33:10.566
No, chief. The guy's gone underground.

33:11.873 --> 33:15.138
Oh, good, commander.
Did you talk to your warden friend?

33:15.309 --> 33:17.140
Yeah. When I called yesterday...

33:17.311 --> 33:19.711
...they moved Cruz Soto
into solitary confinement.

33:19.881 --> 33:22.748
No one has so much as spoken to him
since his dad called...

33:22.917 --> 33:24.817
...to break the bad news about Manuel.

33:26.654 --> 33:31.489
Wait a minute. You had Cruz put in isolation
before I made the notification to his father.

33:31.659 --> 33:35.220
Have the warden send a recording
of the phone call Mr. Soto made to his son.

33:35.396 --> 33:36.624
Thank you.

33:39.734 --> 33:43.170
<i>- Cruz?
- Dad, why are you calling me so early?</i>

33:43.871 --> 33:48.638
<i>- Manuel, he got shot. He's dead.
- How did that happen?</i>

33:48.810 --> 33:52.075
<i>He was partying at that house
on Alma, and some girl shot him.</i>

33:52.246 --> 33:54.111
<i>Son of a bitch.</i>

33:54.282 --> 33:56.876
<i>He shouldn't have been at that house.
Who was he with?</i>

33:57.051 --> 33:59.178
<i>Pescado, Stank and Sniper.</i>

34:00.955 --> 34:05.085
- Translation. Translation.
- "I wish I could get out for the funeral."

34:06.427 --> 34:07.792
"I know."

34:09.731 --> 34:11.926
"But I can't.
So make sure there's a funeral."

34:12.632 --> 34:14.100
"I will."

34:15.570 --> 34:17.731
"You know who to talk to
about making those arrangements?"

34:19.273 --> 34:20.534
"Yeah."

34:21.042 --> 34:24.034
- "Yes. Goodbye."
- "Make sure there's a funeral."

34:24.212 --> 34:25.509
Now we know how Cruz Soto...

34:25.679 --> 34:29.980
...passed along that assassination order.
- Chief, looking at the call log here.

34:30.150 --> 34:33.348
This phone call was recorded
at 7:30 a.m.

34:33.521 --> 34:37.650
And we didn't notify Mr. Soto
about Manuel being dead until 2 p.m.

34:37.824 --> 34:40.020
So the old man knew his kid was dead...

34:40.194 --> 34:42.458
...before we did?
- How'd he know about the girl?

34:42.630 --> 34:46.065
We're about to find out. Lieutenant Tao,
get in touch with Animal Control.

34:48.069 --> 34:50.731
Mr. Soto, we need to talk to you
about your son.

34:51.539 --> 34:56.340
- You already told me. He's dead.
- I'm talking about your other son, Cruz.

34:57.211 --> 34:58.906
Okay.

35:07.088 --> 35:08.555
Sam?

35:09.423 --> 35:10.890
Come on.

35:13.094 --> 35:15.756
I need you to put both of
your hands where I can see them.

35:15.930 --> 35:18.660
Do it now. Do it now.

35:18.833 --> 35:21.825
Mr. Soto, I want you to very slowly
take your hands out...

35:22.003 --> 35:23.937
...from underneath the blanket now!

35:26.507 --> 35:27.701
Oh, chief, he's shot.

35:27.875 --> 35:29.706
- I'll call the paramedics.
- No, don't.

35:29.877 --> 35:33.506
We can't just let you bleed to death.
Now, tell me who shot you.

35:34.582 --> 35:35.606
No one.

35:35.783 --> 35:38.251
- Did Pescado shoot you?
- Who's Pescado?

35:38.419 --> 35:40.751
Mr. Soto,
I really wish you wouldn't be that way.

35:40.922 --> 35:43.516
I mean, look at your leg.
That is a serious injury.

35:44.292 --> 35:45.623
That's the life.

35:45.793 --> 35:48.261
I ain't afraid of dying
as long as I die strong.

35:54.135 --> 35:55.568
Okay.

35:57.538 --> 36:00.530
While you're still conscious,
I think you should be aware...

36:00.708 --> 36:04.906
...that I have a recording of the phone call
that you made to your eldest son yesterday.

36:05.079 --> 36:07.980
So I know that he ordered you
to have Pescado killed...

36:08.149 --> 36:09.810
...along with Stank and Sniper.

36:11.552 --> 36:13.315
- Bullshit.
- I'm gonna play that tape...

36:13.487 --> 36:16.320
...at Cruz's parole hearing next month...

36:16.490 --> 36:19.482
...and he'll end up in jail
for the next two years.

36:19.994 --> 36:25.091
But if you were to admit
that you killed those boys on your own...

36:25.433 --> 36:26.957
...then Cruz could go free.

36:34.075 --> 36:35.337
Cruz didn't order anything.

36:35.509 --> 36:39.843
Okay, sir, I need to inform you of your
rights. You have the right to remain silent.

36:40.014 --> 36:43.142
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

36:43.317 --> 36:46.878
I have the right to an attorney.
If I can't afford one, you will provide one.

36:47.054 --> 36:50.683
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I heard it all before.
I waive my rights.

36:51.659 --> 36:53.593
Good.

36:54.228 --> 36:58.096
Now, the phone call between you and Cruz
was recorded at 7:30 in the morning.

36:58.266 --> 37:00.996
That was hours before we informed you
of Manuel's death.

37:01.168 --> 37:03.796
So who told you
that Manuel had been murdered?

37:07.608 --> 37:09.098
Pescado.

37:09.277 --> 37:11.302
He came by.

37:12.113 --> 37:17.050
He said he and Stank and Sniper
were partying with Manuel.

37:18.786 --> 37:21.346
And some stupid bitch,
who was all high, shot him.

37:22.857 --> 37:24.119
What did you do after that?

37:25.393 --> 37:27.759
I told Pescado to call 911...

37:27.929 --> 37:30.625
...so Manuel's body wouldn't rot
in that house.

37:30.798 --> 37:34.734
Those idiots had left him there.
They went out hunting for that girl.

37:35.236 --> 37:38.034
And then you called your son Cruz.
Is that correct?

37:38.205 --> 37:40.901
- Yeah.
- So, what did you do in the seven hours...

37:41.075 --> 37:43.543
...between the time of your conversation
with Cruz...

37:43.711 --> 37:46.407
...and when we notified you
about Manuel?

37:49.750 --> 37:50.910
I couldn't find my gun.

37:51.786 --> 37:54.084
So I went out and found another one.

37:54.255 --> 37:56.780
And I took it over to Stank's house.

37:57.291 --> 38:01.421
And I went in the backyard,
and I shot those two punks.

38:06.567 --> 38:07.591
Pescado wasn't there.

38:08.502 --> 38:12.165
- You found him this morning, didn't you?
- Yeah.

38:12.340 --> 38:14.069
I guess he was expecting me.

38:14.241 --> 38:16.766
- So Pescado did shoot you?
- Yeah.

38:16.944 --> 38:20.072
- Do you know where he went?
- Nowhere.

38:20.247 --> 38:24.081
He barely got off one round
before I popped him in the head.

38:25.252 --> 38:27.982
But none of those boys killed Manuel.

38:28.155 --> 38:32.558
- It was that stupid bitch.
- No. She was nothing.

38:33.928 --> 38:35.919
It's their fault my boy was there.

38:36.097 --> 38:38.964
Cruz told those fools
to stay away from Manuel.

38:39.133 --> 38:41.226
But they disrespected Cruz.

38:41.402 --> 38:43.962
And they disrespected me.

38:47.475 --> 38:50.774
Manuel wasn't old enough
for Tres Colores yet.

38:52.613 --> 38:54.342
One more year.

38:54.982 --> 38:56.950
But they didn't listen.

38:57.585 --> 39:00.053
So they paid the price.

39:01.822 --> 39:04.916
So that's it.

39:05.426 --> 39:07.986
You won't be testifying
at Cruz's parole hearing, right?

39:08.429 --> 39:09.657
No.

39:10.664 --> 39:13.724
I'll save everything I have to say about Cruz
for his murder trial.

39:14.402 --> 39:17.769
His murder trial? But you said...

39:18.239 --> 39:21.140
You lied to me. You lied... You lied!

39:21.308 --> 39:24.300
I'm sorry if you feel misled, sir,
but I did not lie to you.

39:24.478 --> 39:27.845
As soon as you and your son
are convicted of three counts of murder...

39:28.015 --> 39:30.643
...parole will no longer be an issue.

39:32.453 --> 39:34.751
As you said, that's the life.

39:34.922 --> 39:37.447
Which is exactly what you and your son
will be serving.

39:39.226 --> 39:41.592
- Ma'am?
- Gentlemen.

39:43.998 --> 39:45.761
It's gonna be all right.

39:56.977 --> 39:58.342
Hi.

39:58.512 --> 40:00.480
Hi, Camilla.

40:00.648 --> 40:02.775
She's really not up
to any more questions.

40:02.950 --> 40:05.043
No, no, no.
I don't have any more questions.

40:05.219 --> 40:09.815
I just wanted to let you both know
that it's safe to go home now.

40:10.357 --> 40:12.689
You don't have to worry
about those men ever again.

40:15.463 --> 40:18.330
- You arrested them?
- No.

40:19.300 --> 40:21.200
They're all dead.

40:24.071 --> 40:26.631
- All of them?
- All of them.

40:28.909 --> 40:29.933
Even Manuel?

40:32.713 --> 40:34.738
Even Manuel.

40:35.382 --> 40:39.546
But you're not legally responsible
for his death. So...

40:40.688 --> 40:41.848
It's all over.

40:48.195 --> 40:50.993
It doesn't feel over to me.

41:07.915 --> 41:10.179
- Hi.
- Hey.

41:23.397 --> 41:24.421
What's this?

41:25.132 --> 41:26.258
It's for you.

41:26.800 --> 41:30.998
- What for?
- For bringing a little Joel into our lives.

41:37.178 --> 41:41.672
- I didn't react well when I first met her.
- Oh, my God. It's a him.

41:42.516 --> 41:44.677
Joel is a him. Kitty was a her.

41:44.852 --> 41:48.219
I was worried that if I became attached
to Joel like I was to Kitty...

41:48.389 --> 41:52.553
...that eventually I'd have to go through
the same thing all over again.

41:54.295 --> 41:55.387
Well, I'll be here.

41:56.697 --> 41:58.995
Just like I was before.

41:59.633 --> 42:01.533
And I so appreciate that.

42:07.274 --> 42:08.400
Well, thank you.

42:10.010 --> 42:11.443
And thank you for these too.

42:14.181 --> 42:15.808
Half of them are gone.

42:18.252 --> 42:20.049
I had a really hard day.
