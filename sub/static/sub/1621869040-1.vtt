00:07.375 --> 00:08.667
REPORTER: Authorities are
still searching for the killer

00:08.750 --> 00:09.458
of Erin McMenamin.

00:09.875 --> 00:11.250
KENNY MCMENAMIN:
Mare, get this son of a bitch,

00:11.542 --> 00:13.417
because if you don't,
I'll kill him myself.

00:14.041 --> 00:16.208
CHIEF CARTER: I know what you've
been through.

00:17.208 --> 00:18.500
Recommit yourself.

00:19.166 --> 00:20.875
Go back to the file.
Dig deep.

00:21.166 --> 00:22.750
Maybe it's a serial killer.

00:23.375 --> 00:24.417
Christ, Mom.

00:25.542 --> 00:26.917
I'm gonna find out everything.

00:27.542 --> 00:28.583
Every...

00:29.583 --> 00:30.458
thing.

00:54.083 --> 00:56.834
-

02:26.750 --> 02:29.834
I'll reconfirm the time,
and the location.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.750
Wait for my call.

02:35.375 --> 02:37.875
Yes, wear the blue tie.

03:17.667 --> 03:19.917
-

04:56.000 --> 04:57.291
Hello?

04:57.375 --> 04:59.375
Mona Juul
He'll be there at noon.

04:59.458 --> 05:00.834
Excellent, darling.

05:00.917 --> 05:02.000
Mona:
Listen to me.

05:02.083 --> 05:04.750
This meeting is
completely unofficial.

05:04.834 --> 05:06.583
Understood. Absolutely.

05:06.667 --> 05:10.000
You cannot even
mention my ministry.

05:10.083 --> 05:14.083
Darling... Darling...
Trust me.

06:18.542 --> 06:20.959
Two years of multi-national
negotiations

06:21.041 --> 06:23.291
between us and the Palestinians
have achieved

06:23.375 --> 06:25.250
absolutely nothing.

06:25.333 --> 06:26.542
Why? Because our government

06:26.625 --> 06:28.709
refuses to negotiate
directly with the PLO.

06:28.792 --> 06:30.542
They are not allowed
at the table.

06:30.625 --> 06:32.208
But every day,
Ahmed Qurie,

06:32.291 --> 06:34.709
the PLO's finance minister,
in London,

06:34.792 --> 06:37.792
sitting in a hotel room
across the street
from the negotiation

06:37.875 --> 06:41.125
telling the Palestinian
delegation exactly what to say.

06:42.208 --> 06:45.041
We are racing
toward a precipice.

06:45.125 --> 06:48.375
In Europe,
they are calling us Nazis.

06:48.458 --> 06:50.125
In Europe.

06:50.208 --> 06:53.375
Every day, more and more
of the world turns against us,

06:53.458 --> 06:57.041
but all we do is sit at that
fucking negotiation table.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.083
Terje Larsen:
Because you're trapped
in a process

06:59.166 --> 07:02.500
incapable of building trust.

07:03.583 --> 07:05.208
But...

07:05.291 --> 07:08.959
with my assistance,
my expertise,

07:09.041 --> 07:11.250
you could change that.

07:11.333 --> 07:14.208
Tell me exactly what part
of the Norwegian government

07:14.291 --> 07:16.625
-are you with, Mr. Huntsen?
-Larsen.

07:16.709 --> 07:19.083
Call me Terje.

07:19.166 --> 07:21.625
No, I'm a, a private citizen.

07:21.709 --> 07:23.834
I run the Fafo Institute.

07:25.166 --> 07:26.667
A think tank.

07:26.750 --> 07:30.500
-Why would I accept your help?
-Because you need it.

07:32.458 --> 07:35.583
Because my negotiating model,
and mine alone,

07:35.667 --> 07:37.417
is going to help you.

07:37.500 --> 07:40.166
You and the Palestinians
are using

07:40.250 --> 07:43.709
the antiquated negotiating
model of totalism.

07:43.792 --> 07:46.000
All issues of disagreement

07:46.083 --> 07:48.709
on the table.
All sides at the table.

07:48.792 --> 07:52.625
It's disastrous.
The process is formal,
it's rigid,

07:52.709 --> 07:55.500
and the results
are absolute failure.

07:55.583 --> 07:58.083
But this is what
the Americans want us to do.

07:58.166 --> 08:00.875
And so you must do it,
but at the same time,

08:00.959 --> 08:02.917
start a second process.

08:05.208 --> 08:10.333
Built, not on grand
pronouncements between
governments,

08:10.417 --> 08:15.166
but intimate discussions
between people

08:15.250 --> 08:17.959
held somewhere isolated.

08:18.041 --> 08:19.417
Totally.

08:19.500 --> 08:22.917
Where you
and the PLO can meet.
Alone.

08:24.542 --> 08:26.083
And talk.

08:27.250 --> 08:29.875
This process I could oversee.

08:29.959 --> 08:31.041
The place, I'd arrange.

08:31.125 --> 08:34.750
Absolute discretion,
guaranteed.

08:38.750 --> 08:42.583
It is illegal for
any Israeli official
to speak to the PLO.

08:42.667 --> 08:47.792
-Yes.
-But someone unofficial...

08:47.875 --> 08:52.250
-Who you and Peres could choose.
-That you could introduce to.

08:55.417 --> 08:59.208
-Exactly what I was thinking.
-Yes.

09:00.208 --> 09:01.875
-Tea?
-Yes.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.500
Ahmed Qurie:
And how long were you
stationed in the Middle East?

09:07.583 --> 09:09.083
Mona:
Two years.

09:09.166 --> 09:11.542
And from this,
you have just returned.

09:11.625 --> 09:13.125
Yes.

09:14.375 --> 09:15.792
Thank you.

09:17.458 --> 09:19.875
It is a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Qurie.

09:19.959 --> 09:23.542
I'm pleased our work
brings us to London
at the same time.

09:23.625 --> 09:27.208
Ah, well, you are here for work.

09:27.291 --> 09:30.959
But alas, I am here
for foolishness.

09:33.125 --> 09:34.625
In that hotel,

09:34.709 --> 09:38.667
they are negotiating
for the future of Palestine.

09:38.750 --> 09:43.792
Yet I, who am the finance
minister of the PLO,

09:43.875 --> 09:46.542
I am banned, barred,

09:46.625 --> 09:49.542
blocked from the very table

09:49.625 --> 09:52.834
where the economic
future of my people

09:52.917 --> 09:54.542
is to be determined.

09:54.625 --> 09:59.083
Mr. Qurie, you don't need
to give me the speech.

09:59.166 --> 10:00.542
Of course.

10:02.083 --> 10:03.959
You are on our side.

10:04.041 --> 10:06.375
And on theirs.

10:20.041 --> 10:22.458
Forgive me, but
I don't speak Arabic.

10:22.542 --> 10:25.125
And yet you profess
to understand my region

10:25.208 --> 10:26.959
and my people,

10:27.041 --> 10:29.041
when in fact, clearly,

10:29.125 --> 10:32.667
there is very little
that you understand.

10:32.750 --> 10:34.542
Mona:
That may be true.

10:34.625 --> 10:37.625
But I do understand that
your Chairman Arafat's

10:37.709 --> 10:40.625
backing of Saddam Hussein
in the Gulf War

10:40.709 --> 10:43.959
so angered your
now former Arab allies

10:44.041 --> 10:48.917
that they expelled 90,000
Palestinian guest workers,

10:49.000 --> 10:51.667
thereby creating such
a financial catastrophe

10:51.750 --> 10:52.875
for your people,

10:52.959 --> 10:57.417
that the PLO is now stuck
in exile in Tunis,

10:57.500 --> 11:01.834
unable to pay even
the electricity bills.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.667
I also understand

11:05.750 --> 11:09.959
that without additional support
from my government,

11:10.041 --> 11:12.166
your organization will slide

11:12.250 --> 11:15.083
one step closer to irrelevancy.

11:35.750 --> 11:37.917
Mr. Qurie,

11:38.000 --> 11:40.250
tell me how much you need,

11:40.333 --> 11:43.291
and I will do what I can.

11:43.375 --> 11:45.875
But I want you to do one thing.

11:45.959 --> 11:48.917
Not for me. For you.

11:50.500 --> 11:54.959
There's a man being sent here
to London to meet you today.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.166
If you are willing to see him.

12:02.667 --> 12:05.291
-This way. Yep. Mm-hmm.
-I'm not here as my government.

12:05.375 --> 12:08.083
-He knows this, right?
-Yes, he knows. He knows.
He knows.

12:08.166 --> 12:10.041
It is against the law,
Mr. Larsen,

12:10.125 --> 12:12.041
-for any Israeli--
-Both: To meet with the PLO.

12:12.125 --> 12:15.583
I know. Shh, shh, shh.
After you. After you.
Hello. Thank you.

12:15.667 --> 12:17.417
-Yes, he knows. Come on.

12:17.500 --> 12:20.750
-Absolutely. Absolutely.
-But, I, I, I--
Wait, wait, wait...

12:29.500 --> 12:31.000
What's wrong?

12:37.166 --> 12:42.000
I have never met
an Israeli face-to-face.

12:56.333 --> 12:59.375
-

13:02.417 --> 13:04.458
Now, you know what
you're going to say?

13:04.542 --> 13:06.542
-Ah, yes, yes.
Yes, of course.
-Okay.

13:06.625 --> 13:09.917
Yeah, yeah. Right. Okay.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.875
-Right. Here we go.
-

13:32.291 --> 13:33.333
Oh.

13:34.792 --> 13:36.375
Hello.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.542
Hello.

13:46.375 --> 13:50.542
London is very cold
this time of year.

13:50.625 --> 13:52.375
Yes.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.125
And wet.

13:55.959 --> 13:57.750
Yes.

13:57.834 --> 13:59.291
Not like home.

14:04.291 --> 14:08.917
I have not been home
since 1967,

14:09.000 --> 14:12.333
when every man, woman,
and child in my village

14:12.417 --> 14:14.333
was forced to flee our homeland,

14:14.417 --> 14:17.750
before the advancing
hordes of Zionism.

14:19.417 --> 14:20.625
Aah.

14:23.417 --> 14:26.000
But I remember well
the warmth there

14:26.083 --> 14:27.750
this time of year.

14:31.250 --> 14:33.208
I read your latest paper.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.458
Oh?

14:37.542 --> 14:39.959
I thought it was excellent.

14:40.875 --> 14:43.000
Thank you.

14:43.083 --> 14:46.417
As a matter of fact, I...

14:46.500 --> 14:49.041
I've written a paper of my own,

14:49.125 --> 14:53.667
demonstrating the benefits
of such economic cooperation.

14:53.750 --> 14:56.750
Perhaps if you could read it.

14:56.834 --> 14:59.667
Give me your
professional feedback.

15:08.834 --> 15:10.917
I would be honored.

15:24.750 --> 15:26.250
Mona:
Gentlemen, it's time.

15:26.333 --> 15:30.291
-You have been most generous
with your thoughts.

15:37.166 --> 15:39.041
We should meet again.

15:39.125 --> 15:42.417
To discuss economics.

15:42.500 --> 15:44.000
The future.

15:45.834 --> 15:50.750
I'm told if we were
to meet in Oslo,

15:50.834 --> 15:53.125
Friends would prove--
appro--

15:54.542 --> 15:58.000
Sorry... Sorry.

16:00.375 --> 16:05.583
I am told if we were
to meet in Oslo,

16:05.667 --> 16:08.208
friends would provide us

16:08.291 --> 16:10.333
solitude and privacy,

16:10.417 --> 16:14.208
and anything else
we would require.

16:18.834 --> 16:21.208
Who are you?

16:21.291 --> 16:24.333
I'm just a professor
of economics

16:24.417 --> 16:27.375
who supports dialogue
with the PLO.

16:27.458 --> 16:30.083
On whose authority do you speak?

16:30.166 --> 16:32.375
I have no authority!

16:33.792 --> 16:38.542
But I am having breakfast
tomorrow in Tel Aviv

16:38.625 --> 16:41.667
with my dear good friend
Yossi Beilin.

16:42.709 --> 16:44.792
I am so looking forward

16:44.875 --> 16:48.291
to telling our new
deputy foreign minister

16:48.375 --> 16:50.917
about my trip to London.

16:59.458 --> 17:01.375
-Jan Egeland: My God.

17:01.458 --> 17:03.333
I mean, my God,
that's impossible.

17:03.417 --> 17:05.000
Larsen:
Jan, the Berlin Wall
has just fallen,

17:05.083 --> 17:08.000
the Soviet empire has disbanded.
Anything is possible.

17:08.083 --> 17:09.625
If we set up a meeting
here in Norway,

17:09.709 --> 17:12.208
Ahmed Qurie will come
as the voice of the PLO.

17:12.291 --> 17:14.709
There is no voice of the PLO
but Arafat's, Mona.

17:14.792 --> 17:16.208
Who is this Ahmed Qurie?

17:16.291 --> 17:19.166
How can you be sure
this man has even told Arafat
what he's doing?

17:19.250 --> 17:22.000
Because Arafat is fully
informed and behind this.

17:22.083 --> 17:24.041
-Really?
-Yes. Absolutely.

17:24.125 --> 17:26.959
And if we host it,
the Israelis are on board,
as well.

17:27.041 --> 17:28.208
No. Mona,

17:28.291 --> 17:30.542
Yossi Beilin is on board,
who does not have the authority

17:30.625 --> 17:32.333
-to authorize such a thing.
-Larsen: Jan, Jan. Jan, Jan.

17:32.417 --> 17:34.375
Yossi told me to my face.
Directly.

17:34.458 --> 17:37.458
This comes from Shimon Peres.
No question.

17:37.542 --> 17:40.291
Mona, you are I are members
of the foreign service.

17:40.375 --> 17:42.959
We cannot jeopardize
the Norwegian government's
neutrality in this conflict--

17:43.041 --> 17:44.625
We're not talking
about involving
the Norwegian government.

17:44.709 --> 17:46.333
-This is just us. It's just us.
-Do you not see
the impossibility

17:46.417 --> 17:47.959
in what you are proposing here?

17:48.041 --> 17:51.375
You're a junior minister,
and Terje's just a sociologist.

17:51.458 --> 17:54.250
Then that must be enough.

17:54.333 --> 17:57.625
Listen, we will say that
Terje's institute is hosting

17:57.709 --> 17:59.041
a conference here in Norway

17:59.125 --> 18:02.291
for Israeli and Palestinian
academics.

18:02.375 --> 18:05.291
Terje will ask a friend
to loan us his manor house.

18:05.375 --> 18:09.083
I will book them all
on regular flights
under different names.

18:09.166 --> 18:12.542
Rental cars only,
and no diplomatic channels.

18:14.709 --> 18:17.041
But for this to work,
we need you

18:17.125 --> 18:19.291
to sign off on their visas.

18:19.375 --> 18:22.125
Jan. Jan, listen.

18:22.208 --> 18:25.041
No one else in the government
needs to know.

18:25.125 --> 18:28.667
This way, Holst
and the ministry
is protected.

18:34.125 --> 18:36.083
If you say no,
this conversation
never happened.

18:36.166 --> 18:38.834
-Isn't that right, Terje?
-Of course.

18:45.875 --> 18:48.625
Let's fucking do it.

18:48.709 --> 18:51.667
-Yes?
-But officially,
this is Fafo's scheme.

18:51.750 --> 18:54.834
-If this goes to shit,
it's all on you.
-Absolutely. Absolutely.

18:54.917 --> 18:58.125
-And don't tell the Americans.
-What are you talking about?

18:58.208 --> 19:00.125
What are we going to tell them?
"Hello. Nothing has happened,

19:00.208 --> 19:01.625
and we, we just
wanted you to know."

19:01.709 --> 19:03.458
Do you know what
their government
will do to ours

19:03.542 --> 19:05.083
if we're caught meddling
in the Middle East?

19:05.166 --> 19:06.458
Mona, how are we going
to keep things hidden

19:06.542 --> 19:07.583
if the Americans are involved?

19:07.667 --> 19:08.959
Okay, this is a diplomatic
issue, darling,

19:09.041 --> 19:11.250
-which is none of your concern.
-I agree with Terje.

19:14.041 --> 19:17.125
If we are going to take a risk,

19:17.208 --> 19:18.875
let's take a risk.

19:20.083 --> 19:21.417
Okay.

19:23.458 --> 19:24.750
So...

19:26.208 --> 19:27.917
Here we go.

20:08.667 --> 20:10.834
-

20:15.125 --> 20:17.792
Mona:
Terje, if this fails...

20:17.875 --> 20:21.000
-If this goes wrong--
-Darling, we have a plan now,

20:21.083 --> 20:24.375
and if it goes wrong,
then we'll improvise.

20:24.458 --> 20:26.792
Our lives will be ruined.

20:28.166 --> 20:30.333
Do you understand?

20:30.417 --> 20:31.959
Yes, I do.

20:33.291 --> 20:35.458
But we have a chance now.

20:35.542 --> 20:38.875
A real chance to
make a difference.

20:38.959 --> 20:42.959
Whatever happens between them,

20:44.750 --> 20:48.375
we will not interfere.

20:48.458 --> 20:51.375
If we are seen
by anyone as favoring

20:51.458 --> 20:54.458
-one side over the oth--
-Darling, I would never
do such a thing.

20:56.542 --> 20:58.375
Then say it.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.625
We will facilitate,

21:01.709 --> 21:04.458
and facilitate only.
Say it.

21:04.542 --> 21:07.166
-We will facilitate.

21:08.041 --> 21:10.709
Only.

21:10.792 --> 21:14.875
We will facilitate,
and facilitate...

21:14.959 --> 21:16.208
only.

21:17.083 --> 21:18.500
Thank you.

21:26.834 --> 21:30.250
Your bastards of
immigration with their,

21:30.333 --> 21:32.625
"Stand in that line
and shut your mouth,

21:32.709 --> 21:34.417
and do as you are told."

21:34.500 --> 21:37.041
Like I am some
underwear merchant!

21:37.125 --> 21:39.250
Uh, sorry. I'm sorry.
Everything's fine.
It's all right.

21:39.333 --> 21:40.834
It's all right.
Everything's fine.
It's just a little--

21:40.917 --> 21:42.750
little mix-up.
I'm so sorry.
That wasn't, um,

21:42.834 --> 21:44.291
wasn't part of the, the plan.

21:44.375 --> 21:45.667
You should have been
sent straight through,

21:45.750 --> 21:47.000
no, no questions asked.

21:47.083 --> 21:50.333
Hello. Let me, let me,
let me, let me take your bag.

21:50.417 --> 21:51.709
Good.

21:54.041 --> 21:54.917
All right?

21:58.375 --> 21:59.875
Good trip?

22:04.458 --> 22:06.000
Ow.

22:07.125 --> 22:08.875
There is no motorcade?

22:11.125 --> 22:13.917
No. Just me.

22:18.500 --> 22:23.834
Mr. Larsen, we have flown
across the world

22:23.917 --> 22:26.125
in the seating of the coach.

22:26.208 --> 22:30.000
I know, gentlemen,
but this is the best way.

22:30.083 --> 22:31.542
Trust me.

22:46.583 --> 22:48.083
All right.

23:00.291 --> 23:01.834
Ooh! Sorry.

23:04.291 --> 23:05.583
Okay.

23:05.667 --> 23:07.667
Right. Let's go.

24:48.917 --> 24:51.291
From the Palestinian
Liberation Organization,

24:51.375 --> 24:54.083
Mr. Ahmed Qurie,
and his associate,

24:54.166 --> 24:57.166
Mr. Hassan Asfour.

24:57.250 --> 25:00.542
And from the
University of Haifa,

25:00.625 --> 25:03.500
Professor Yair Hirschfeld,
and his associate,

25:03.583 --> 25:05.625
Professor Ron Pundak.

25:05.709 --> 25:09.125
Hello. And, hello.

25:13.417 --> 25:16.166
This regal and historic
guest house

25:16.250 --> 25:20.125
is built on the very site
where 800 years ago,

25:20.208 --> 25:24.667
St. Olaf himself erected
his castle, stone by stone,

25:24.750 --> 25:28.333
as he strove to make
Norway a nation.

25:28.417 --> 25:30.000
And your Olaf was killed,

25:30.083 --> 25:33.333
and his castle destroyed
in a landslide.

25:33.417 --> 25:36.542
Yes, thank you.
Thank you.

25:36.625 --> 25:38.834
Much appreciated.

25:38.917 --> 25:41.083
I don't know about
the rest of you, but...

25:41.166 --> 25:43.333
my God, I find it cold here.

25:43.417 --> 25:47.125
Not as cold as the hearts
of your jack-booted
Zionist soldiers

25:47.208 --> 25:50.834
as they break the bones
of the sons and daughters
of Gaza.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.959
Again, thank you.

25:57.959 --> 25:59.792
Much appreciated.

26:02.375 --> 26:04.208
Gentlemen, you are here
because you know

26:04.291 --> 26:06.917
that you and your people
cannot go on as you have.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.709
That whatever you
personally feel,

26:09.792 --> 26:12.709
you want to find
the way forward.

26:12.792 --> 26:15.083
So, tell me, Abu Ala--

26:15.166 --> 26:16.750
Ahmed Qurie.

26:16.834 --> 26:18.917
I am Ahmed Qurie!

26:19.000 --> 26:21.041
-But your friends
call you Abu Ala, yes?
-Listen--

26:21.125 --> 26:24.458
While here, here,
we are all friends.

26:25.792 --> 26:28.250
And while we are here together,

26:28.333 --> 26:33.291
that must be our one
unbreakable rule.

26:34.959 --> 26:37.542
Now please, follow me.

26:43.250 --> 26:46.083
In that room,
when the door is closed,

26:46.166 --> 26:48.083
you four will talk,

26:48.166 --> 26:50.208
you'll disagree, worse.

26:50.291 --> 26:51.917
But out here,
we'll share our meals.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.083
We'll talk of our families.
We'll light the fire.

26:55.166 --> 26:58.208
Because it's only in
the sharing of the personal

26:58.291 --> 27:02.291
that we can see each other
for who we truly are.

27:04.500 --> 27:06.667
I, uh... we...

27:06.750 --> 27:09.542
accept your rule, and, uh,

27:09.625 --> 27:11.875
we are willing to try.

27:41.500 --> 27:45.625
Between our peoples
lies a vast ocean.

27:45.709 --> 27:48.709
Those who have tried
to cross before us

27:48.792 --> 27:51.750
have turned back, or drowned.

27:52.834 --> 27:54.709
Let us be the first

27:54.792 --> 27:57.709
to step upon the other's shore.

27:57.792 --> 27:59.041
Good.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.417
Good luck.

28:10.500 --> 28:14.417
You mean... it is to be just us?

28:17.750 --> 28:20.333
Out here, I will do
all that you ask,

28:20.417 --> 28:22.583
but in there, I cannot help you.

28:22.667 --> 28:26.083
Only you, together,
can do this.

28:42.125 --> 28:43.750
So what do you think?

28:43.834 --> 28:47.083
I think if Hassan Asfour
doesn't kill us in our sleep,

28:47.166 --> 28:49.166
it will be a miracle.

29:07.625 --> 29:10.500
No, no, no, no.
They must be
facing each other.

29:10.583 --> 29:12.834
Good. Did you get
what I asked for?

29:12.917 --> 29:14.583
The Johnny Walker Black.
Ja.

29:14.667 --> 29:16.667
-How many bottles?
-Four.

29:17.500 --> 29:19.000
We'll need four cases.

29:20.500 --> 29:22.959
-Terje, no!
-What about dinner?

29:23.041 --> 29:26.834
-I will serve herring to start.
-Larsen: Herring. Good.

29:26.917 --> 29:29.750
-A small pasta course.
-Larsen: Excellent.

29:29.834 --> 29:31.250
And roasted pork

29:31.333 --> 29:33.875
-stuffed with sage--
-Oh, no! No, no, no.

29:33.959 --> 29:35.417
No. Out of the question.

29:35.500 --> 29:37.417
-I've already
prepared the dish--
-Serve some fish.

29:37.500 --> 29:39.834
Fish, yes? Salmon.
Salmon, yes?

29:39.917 --> 29:42.333
-Good. Just do it.
-Mr. Larsen--

29:42.417 --> 29:43.542
Yes?

29:43.625 --> 29:47.125
Okay.
-Thank you. Thank you.

29:51.375 --> 29:54.417
I must speak with
the chairman in Tunis.

29:58.125 --> 30:00.709
Follow me, sir.
If you would.

30:13.291 --> 30:16.834
They say they will take Gaza.

30:18.792 --> 30:22.041
They propose Israel withdraw
all forces from Gaza.

30:22.125 --> 30:24.917
That the territory
will be turned over
to the Palestinians,

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
who will govern it themselves.

30:28.083 --> 30:30.041
My God.

30:30.125 --> 30:33.083
To be able to pull out of Gaza,

30:33.166 --> 30:35.542
that would end the Intifada!

30:35.625 --> 30:38.208
They, they, they want
to go even further!

30:38.291 --> 30:41.166
They've brought an outline
for a declaration of principles

30:41.250 --> 30:44.875
that spells out precisely
the issues between us

30:44.959 --> 30:47.917
that both sides
agree to address.

30:50.333 --> 30:52.000
What should I do?

30:52.083 --> 30:55.083
-Well, it's, it's easy, Yair.
You just, you--
-Mona: Terje.

30:59.125 --> 31:00.583
Larsen:
Um...

31:02.667 --> 31:04.542
That's not for me to say.

31:06.959 --> 31:10.083
Yair, trust that you need
no road map.

31:10.166 --> 31:13.583
The way will show itself.

31:24.875 --> 31:28.125
That is completely
fucking stupid.

31:43.458 --> 31:45.500
Abu Ala.
His glass is empty.

31:45.583 --> 31:47.709
Thank you, Toril.

31:47.792 --> 31:49.625
It's good wine, yes?

31:49.709 --> 31:52.291
Yes. Wine, yes.

31:55.166 --> 31:57.959
Dinner is excellent.

31:58.041 --> 32:00.667
-Thank you.
-Larsen: Yes, it is.
Thank you.

32:02.208 --> 32:05.083
But Hassan, you've barely
touched your food.

32:05.166 --> 32:08.125
Hassan is from Gaza,

32:08.208 --> 32:10.625
where they are all fishermen,

32:10.709 --> 32:13.083
but hate the sight of fish.

32:19.709 --> 32:21.583
Jan
What am I supposed
to tell our foreign minister

32:21.667 --> 32:23.166
when he asks
where you are?

32:23.250 --> 32:26.375
-Tell him it's a family issue.

32:28.291 --> 32:31.709
Jan, things are moving
faster than we expected.

32:31.792 --> 32:33.250
I have to stay.

32:33.333 --> 32:36.542
-

32:36.625 --> 32:39.667
-No more, Larsen. No more!

32:39.750 --> 32:41.834
I couldn't possibly
have another sip.

32:41.917 --> 32:45.375
Yes, Terje.
No more for me, too.
Not even one drop.

32:45.458 --> 32:48.750
Okay, who's next? Abu Ala,
what about your father?

32:48.834 --> 32:50.625
Yes, it's your turn.
Tell us.

32:50.709 --> 32:52.792
Qurie:
He was born in a village

32:52.875 --> 32:55.417
just outside Jerusalem.

32:56.750 --> 33:00.417
As a child, he would
take me to the Old City,

33:00.500 --> 33:04.458
where the very stones
speak to you.

33:04.542 --> 33:07.750
Through the winding streets
we would go,

33:07.834 --> 33:12.500
until we would emerge
and stand before it.

33:12.583 --> 33:18.375
Then he would say,
"There. There, Ahmed.

33:18.458 --> 33:21.458
"That is the al-Aqsa mosque.

33:21.542 --> 33:25.375
"The beating heart of Jerusalem.

33:25.458 --> 33:28.250
"Wherever you go, boy,

33:28.333 --> 33:31.041
"you must always hold it,

33:31.125 --> 33:34.417
"and this city, here.

33:35.792 --> 33:40.291
For it will always be
your home."

33:46.291 --> 33:48.792
-Larsen: And finally...

33:49.875 --> 33:51.417
Hassan.

33:53.083 --> 33:58.041
The, uh, petty bourgeois
construct of family

33:58.125 --> 34:00.291
does not interest me.

34:00.375 --> 34:04.417
The struggle against
the Western capitalist
behemoth...

34:06.542 --> 34:08.291
That is my father.

34:13.333 --> 34:14.875
-That's it.

34:14.959 --> 34:17.041
No more sourpuss from him.

34:17.125 --> 34:18.917
Right. I have a joke.

34:19.000 --> 34:22.083
-Ron.
-No, it's good. It's good.

34:22.166 --> 34:24.667
Interpol, the CIA,

34:24.750 --> 34:28.959
and the Mossad,
are chasing a rabbit.

34:29.041 --> 34:31.166
They go to the edge
of the forest.

34:31.250 --> 34:35.208
Interpol searches the forest,
but they can find no rabbit.

34:35.291 --> 34:39.709
The CIA burns down the forest,
but still, no rabbit.

34:39.792 --> 34:45.500
Then Mossad says,
"Give us 30 minutes."

34:45.583 --> 34:48.625
They go in.
Half-hour later, they come out

34:48.709 --> 34:51.583
with a grizzly bear
in a headlock,

34:51.667 --> 34:54.083
with a broken nose
and a black eye,

34:54.166 --> 34:55.875
and the bear is yelling--

34:55.959 --> 34:58.625
-"Okay, I'm a rabbit!
I'm a rabbit!"
-"I'm a rabbit!"

35:00.667 --> 35:03.250
Pundak:
Oh, Mr. Lenin
likes the joke!

35:08.375 --> 35:11.291
I want to tell a joke.

35:11.375 --> 35:13.959
A man is married 40 years.

35:14.041 --> 35:16.542
Then, his wife, she dies.

35:16.625 --> 35:19.875
After the funeral,
after all are gone,

35:19.959 --> 35:23.166
he sits alone in his house.

35:23.250 --> 35:26.959
The shadow of loneliness
falls upon him.

35:27.041 --> 35:28.792
In his solitude,

35:28.875 --> 35:33.333
he cries out,
"I am all alone!

35:33.417 --> 35:35.875
"What will I do now?

35:35.959 --> 35:37.583
"I have no wife!

35:37.667 --> 35:40.625
"No-- No one to
tell me what to do!

35:40.709 --> 35:43.125
No one to tell me
what to say..."

35:48.375 --> 35:51.625
"I am all alone.

35:51.709 --> 35:54.959
"I am all alone.
I am all alo--
I, I, I am all alone!

35:55.041 --> 35:57.625
-All alone! I am all alone!"
-

35:57.709 --> 35:59.792
He looks like Arafat!
No...

35:59.875 --> 36:02.458
Crazy Arafat
gestures on TV!

36:02.542 --> 36:04.583
Do not insult the chairman.

36:04.667 --> 36:06.458
You insult the chairman,
you insult us!

36:06.542 --> 36:08.750
Abu Ala, I didn't mean--
It was a joke--

36:08.834 --> 36:10.834
You think we are
just here as us?

36:10.917 --> 36:12.792
-We are the head
and arms of him!
-

36:12.875 --> 36:14.458
Friends, please, please,
please, please.

36:14.542 --> 36:16.375
We are the head
and arms of him!

36:18.291 --> 36:20.375
-Larsen: Please, please!
-

36:25.125 --> 36:27.542
We will bury you before you
take our honor--

36:27.625 --> 36:30.417
I have brought waffles.

36:31.291 --> 36:34.166
Oh! There she is.

36:34.250 --> 36:37.000
The one I love is here.

36:37.083 --> 36:40.709
Please. Uh, please.
Sit, gentlemen. Sit.

36:40.792 --> 36:42.250
Sit.

36:43.333 --> 36:48.083
This is the waffle recipe
of my mother,

36:48.166 --> 36:50.667
passed down from her mother.

36:50.750 --> 36:54.458
It is simple, but precise.

36:54.542 --> 36:59.125
Vanilla, sugar...

36:59.208 --> 37:01.208
Butter...

37:01.291 --> 37:03.166
Buttermilk...

37:04.417 --> 37:05.875
Flour...

37:05.959 --> 37:10.583
And the secret is the cardamom.

37:11.458 --> 37:13.041
For the serving,

37:13.125 --> 37:16.625
first you spread
the whipped cream

37:16.709 --> 37:18.583
and the raspberry,

37:18.667 --> 37:21.458
and then you eat.

37:31.250 --> 37:32.875
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.125
Mmm.

37:34.208 --> 37:36.917
-Wow.
-All: Mmm...

37:37.000 --> 37:40.500
Qurie:
Good. Very good.
Excellent.

37:46.333 --> 37:49.166
Pundak:
Very, very good.
Thank you.

37:51.500 --> 37:54.000
I propose...

37:56.417 --> 38:01.917
that we agree that
there are certain subjects--

38:02.000 --> 38:06.542
people-- we do not discuss,

38:06.625 --> 38:09.834
just as when we are in there.

38:12.333 --> 38:14.417
Red lines.

38:14.500 --> 38:16.709
Which we do not cross.

38:16.792 --> 38:21.208
Yes. Here, let us be friends.

39:04.083 --> 39:06.667
Type everything up on these.

39:06.750 --> 39:10.417
This way,
if either side leaks it,

39:10.500 --> 39:11.959
the other can claim

39:12.041 --> 39:14.667
the entire thing
is an unofficial idea

39:14.750 --> 39:17.834
concocted by your organization.

41:32.333 --> 41:33.917
Larsen:
Gentlemen, thank you

41:34.000 --> 41:38.333
for your willingness
to take part in these
first few steps.

41:38.417 --> 41:41.959
Uh, make sure you've left
nothing behind. No traces.

41:42.041 --> 41:44.417
Yes? Good, good, good.

41:46.333 --> 41:52.583
So, here are the copies
of the new DOP.

41:52.667 --> 41:57.333
And for God sake,
guard them with your life.

41:57.417 --> 42:00.500
One last order of business
before you go.

42:00.583 --> 42:02.792
When we're speaking
on the phone from now on,

42:02.875 --> 42:06.834
we'll refer to Israel
as "the little country."

42:06.917 --> 42:08.417
Prime Minister Rabin

42:08.500 --> 42:11.458
will be "the grandfather."
Shimon Peres, "the father."

42:11.542 --> 42:13.000
Yossi Beilin, "the son."

42:13.083 --> 42:16.834
The PLO we'll call
"those across the sea."

42:16.917 --> 42:18.333
Chairman Arafat

42:18.417 --> 42:21.041
will be "the grandfather,"
of course, also.

42:21.125 --> 42:23.542
And Abu Ala, uh...

42:26.625 --> 42:28.041
"Puntoffle."

42:28.125 --> 42:30.250
-What?
-

42:30.333 --> 42:34.583
It means "slipper,"
Abu Ala, in Yiddish.

42:37.417 --> 42:42.709
You are an even stranger people
than I imagined.

42:42.792 --> 42:44.041
All right.

42:44.125 --> 42:45.959
-I'll see you at home.
-Okay.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.750
May your travels be safe.

42:57.959 --> 42:59.625
And yours.

43:08.667 --> 43:11.125
You are my first...

43:11.875 --> 43:13.333
Jew.

43:16.667 --> 43:20.291
I hope I was not too stringy.

43:20.375 --> 43:22.291
A bit.

43:24.333 --> 43:27.166
But still better than fish.

43:54.792 --> 43:57.542
Fly well, friends.
Be safe.

44:01.500 --> 44:03.875
With those two,
we can go no further.

44:03.959 --> 44:07.041
We must deal directly
with the Israeli government.

44:07.125 --> 44:10.000
Tell Yossi Beilin
it's time to upgrade,

44:10.083 --> 44:11.542
or this is over.

44:13.709 --> 44:15.959
-

44:16.041 --> 44:17.583
Yossi, the progress
that was made

44:17.667 --> 44:20.291
in one two-day meeting,
it's beyond imagination,

44:20.375 --> 44:23.291
and the Palestinians have
told me they want to return.

44:23.375 --> 44:25.208
Excellent.

44:25.291 --> 44:27.542
So you must see
it's time now to upgrade

44:27.625 --> 44:29.542
the Israeli delegation, yes?

44:29.625 --> 44:31.375
Upgrade?

44:32.834 --> 44:36.291
Terje, Israel has
no delegation to upgrade.

44:36.375 --> 44:37.750
Look at it from the other side.

44:37.834 --> 44:39.792
These are ministers from the PLO

44:39.875 --> 44:41.166
who are risking their lives.

44:41.250 --> 44:43.667
Which as deputy foreign minister
of the State of Israel

44:43.750 --> 44:45.500
is none of my concern.

44:45.583 --> 44:47.417
We've got to give
them something.

44:47.500 --> 44:50.750
Can I least tell them that
Peres is behind this?

44:55.834 --> 44:57.542
He doesn't know?

44:59.750 --> 45:02.291
What-- But you--

45:02.375 --> 45:05.166
-You told me--
-I told you what?

45:05.250 --> 45:08.000
Terje, when people talk to you,

45:08.083 --> 45:10.709
you should really pay attention
to what they actually say.

45:10.792 --> 45:14.458
And not just listen for
whatever you want to hear.

45:16.166 --> 45:18.333
If and when something occurs

45:18.417 --> 45:20.458
that I deem worthy enough

45:20.542 --> 45:22.750
to bring to the foreign
minister's attention,

45:22.834 --> 45:24.834
then he will know.

45:24.917 --> 45:29.333
For now, I and I alone know.

45:30.959 --> 45:34.041
Here I was worried
the Palestinians are
running a rogue operation.

45:34.125 --> 45:36.417
-It turns out it's
the fucking Israelis.
-Yes.

45:36.500 --> 45:38.875
Well, things are a bit more
complicated than we thought.

45:38.959 --> 45:41.875
Complicated? Are you serious?

45:41.959 --> 45:44.625
Mona, you told me that
Peres was on board.

45:44.709 --> 45:46.875
And now Beilin is saying
the opposite.

45:46.959 --> 45:50.959
Look, I want to help
as much as you do.

45:51.041 --> 45:52.917
But we are government officials

45:53.041 --> 45:54.709
who could now be accused
of conspiring

45:54.792 --> 45:56.417
with another government's
official. We...

45:56.500 --> 45:59.750
We could be fired.
Jailed. Worse.

45:59.834 --> 46:02.667
Wait. Wait. What if
we're missing something?

46:03.875 --> 46:05.583
We're not telling Holst,

46:05.667 --> 46:08.750
in order to protect him
and the ministry.

46:08.834 --> 46:11.709
What if Beilin is just
doing the same?

46:11.792 --> 46:13.834
Look, the moment he tells Peres,

46:13.917 --> 46:15.959
Peres will have to tell
Prime Minister Rabin,

46:16.041 --> 46:17.959
and then things
will become official.

46:18.041 --> 46:19.875
And once they're official,

46:19.959 --> 46:21.709
then this whole channel is over.

46:22.917 --> 46:27.417
So, as long as Peres
remains in the dark,

46:27.500 --> 46:31.000
then Beilin can keep
pushing the process forward.

46:31.709 --> 46:33.667
See how far things go.

46:36.041 --> 46:38.166
Oh. I see.

46:41.333 --> 46:43.792
So then we push on.

46:43.875 --> 46:45.709
Right?

46:50.083 --> 46:51.792
One more meeting.

46:51.875 --> 46:54.375
Discreet. Under wraps.

46:55.583 --> 46:57.125
But Mona, we need an upgrade

46:57.208 --> 46:59.834
from the Israeli delegation,
or this won't work.

47:00.542 --> 47:02.625
Yeah, I know.

47:02.709 --> 47:04.291
Reporter:
In response to the
escalating violence

47:04.375 --> 47:06.834
between Israeli and
Palestinian civilians,

47:06.917 --> 47:09.959
Prime Minister Rabin
has sealed Gaza.

47:10.041 --> 47:11.583
Yitzhak Rabin:
On one hand,

47:11.667 --> 47:14.959
we would like the Gazans
to work in Israel,

47:15.041 --> 47:16.458
because otherwise,

47:16.542 --> 47:18.750
they don't have
any source of income

47:18.834 --> 47:21.166
to sustain themselves.

47:21.250 --> 47:23.583
At the same time,
I am responsible

47:23.667 --> 47:26.333
for the security
of the people of Israel.

47:26.417 --> 47:29.333
And how to mitigate
between the two,

47:29.417 --> 47:31.917
this is the key problem.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.333
Beilin
For God's sake, Terje,

47:33.417 --> 47:35.709
our people are being
murdered in the streets!

47:35.792 --> 47:38.542
If our grandfather
did not close the border,

47:38.625 --> 47:41.333
-he would have been
hounded from office.
-Yossi-- Yossi, I understand.

47:41.417 --> 47:43.333
I more than understand.
I empathize.

47:43.417 --> 47:45.667
But those across the sea
are emphatic.

47:45.750 --> 47:48.875
They say the little country
must upgrade their delegation.

47:48.959 --> 47:51.166
Beilin:
You tell Puntoffle
that when he puts

47:51.250 --> 47:53.000
something on the table
of substance,

47:53.083 --> 47:54.959
then we will consider
his request.

47:55.041 --> 47:56.917
-But they are not--
-

47:59.291 --> 48:02.375
Qurie
Larsen? Larsen?

48:02.458 --> 48:04.041
What do they say?

48:04.125 --> 48:05.917
Puntoffle, hello.
The son, uh,

48:06.000 --> 48:07.583
wishes me to
respectfully inform you

48:07.667 --> 48:11.458
that, uh, when a more
substantial offer
is put forth,

48:11.542 --> 48:16.625
uh, your request for,
uh, an upgrade, uh,
will be considered.

48:18.041 --> 48:20.375
Qurie:
Fuck him!
He's a fucking bastard!

48:20.458 --> 48:23.041
We have offered to take
Gaza off their hands!

48:23.125 --> 48:26.750
We are the ones whose lives
hang in the balance!

48:26.834 --> 48:30.375
They will not upgrade,
so I will not return.

48:30.458 --> 48:31.583
They will upgrade.

48:31.667 --> 48:33.542
-Terje--
-Qurie: They will?

48:33.625 --> 48:34.959
-Larsen: Uh, yeah.
-Qurie: Who are they sending?

48:35.041 --> 48:37.041
-What are you doing?
-I don't know the details yet,

48:37.125 --> 48:38.417
but, but an upgrade is coming.

48:38.500 --> 48:40.625
Qurie:
How do you know this?

48:42.417 --> 48:44.250
Uh, Mona told me.

48:44.333 --> 48:47.250
-What?
-She's met with the son
from the little country,

48:47.333 --> 48:50.083
and she made him promise
that if you return to Oslo,

48:50.166 --> 48:51.959
then they'll send an upgrade.

48:52.041 --> 48:53.250
Guaranteed.

48:53.333 --> 48:55.834
-Qurie: Mona has done this?
-Yeah.

48:57.166 --> 48:59.375
Qurie:
Swear it to me, Larsen.

48:59.458 --> 49:01.500
On the soul of your wife.

49:01.583 --> 49:04.834
I swear on the soul of my wife.

49:09.375 --> 49:10.917
You've got to trust me.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.208
Qurie:
I trust Mona.

49:13.291 --> 49:15.959
Without her, you are nothing.

49:16.041 --> 49:18.250
Book the flight.

49:18.333 --> 49:19.834
Thank you.

49:21.875 --> 49:23.583
-Mona: Ahem.

49:23.667 --> 49:25.500
Whoo.

49:37.458 --> 49:40.792
Do you have any idea
what you have done?

49:40.875 --> 49:45.083
You have promised
something I cannot do.

49:45.166 --> 49:47.250
-But Yossi will upgrade.
-How do you know that?

49:47.333 --> 49:50.250
-Because, Mona. He will.
-That's not an answer, Terje.

49:50.333 --> 49:52.125
Okay, darling,

49:52.208 --> 49:54.166
just look at all we've achieved.

49:54.250 --> 49:55.792
That you have now jeopardized
by your recklessness.

49:55.875 --> 49:57.625
By your total disregard
of everything we agreed to.

49:57.709 --> 49:59.709
A hundred years of hatred
and bloodshed teetering
on the cusp of change.

49:59.792 --> 50:01.125
We've gotta do
whatever it takes.

50:01.208 --> 50:03.375
Except lying to them, Terje!

50:03.458 --> 50:06.291
-Only a bungling amateur lies.
-Oh, God.

50:06.375 --> 50:08.917
You are so fucking Norwegian!

50:09.000 --> 50:11.291
Everything is a fucking problem.

50:11.375 --> 50:13.291
Everything is an objection!

50:13.375 --> 50:15.208
I am on the phone with
them day and night,

50:15.291 --> 50:16.750
fighting to stay on my feet,

50:16.834 --> 50:19.500
and all you want me to do
is sink to my fucking knees!

50:19.583 --> 50:21.917
This is finished, Terje.

50:24.959 --> 50:26.375
It's finished.

50:36.750 --> 50:39.083
Unless we do one thing.

50:43.792 --> 50:45.125
What?

50:46.208 --> 50:48.625
Tell Holst what we are doing.

50:49.959 --> 50:54.375
-No. No, Mona.
He's a megalomaniac.
-Yes.

50:54.458 --> 50:59.041
And now, that megalomaniac
is exactly what we need.

50:59.125 --> 51:01.834
Holst does nothing
in half measures.

51:01.917 --> 51:03.542
If we can convince him,

51:03.625 --> 51:06.792
he'll throw the full weight
of the ministry behind us.

51:06.875 --> 51:09.375
He will help us
get that upgrade,

51:09.458 --> 51:12.458
and then we will
make this happen.

51:17.208 --> 51:19.291
Larsen:
You...

51:20.250 --> 51:21.792
are the most extraordinary woman

51:21.875 --> 51:23.709
-who has ever lived.
-No, Terje, we don't
have time for this.

51:23.792 --> 51:25.458
-There are no words...
-Terje, we don't have
time for this.

51:25.542 --> 51:28.500
-to describe how
wonderful you are.
-Stop talking. Stop talking.

51:32.291 --> 51:35.625
The violation of protocol
has been totally inappropriate.

51:35.709 --> 51:38.083
-I agree.
-My God, the risks.

51:38.166 --> 51:39.917
Not even a security detail.

51:40.000 --> 51:41.709
That was Larsen's idea.

51:41.792 --> 51:44.417
Driving alone,
middle of the night.
Rental cars.

51:44.500 --> 51:47.291
-Again Larsen.
-Mmm.

51:47.375 --> 51:48.834
Minister Holst,

51:48.917 --> 51:53.041
in but one meeting,
the Israelis and ourselves

51:53.125 --> 51:56.625
have made progress
beyond all hopes.

51:57.625 --> 51:59.417
With your support,

51:59.500 --> 52:01.000
our secret channel

52:01.083 --> 52:03.667
will continue to feed
fresh water

52:03.750 --> 52:07.667
to the official
Washington-sponsored talks.

52:13.041 --> 52:17.083
You are your nation's
greatest statesman.

52:17.166 --> 52:21.333
Only you can move
our two peoples towards

52:21.417 --> 52:23.834
a true and lasting peace.

52:34.166 --> 52:35.375
At all further meetings,

52:35.458 --> 52:38.500
there will be an elite,
two-man security detail

52:38.583 --> 52:39.875
chosen by me.

52:39.959 --> 52:41.166
Agreed.

52:41.250 --> 52:43.375
My deputy, Jan Egeland,

52:43.458 --> 52:46.917
-will run all further liaisons
between the PLO and--
-No!

52:47.667 --> 52:49.458
It must be Larsen.

52:49.542 --> 52:51.875
His ways are strange,

52:51.959 --> 52:54.208
but through his methods,

52:54.291 --> 52:58.834
we have begun a true dialogue
between our peoples.

52:58.917 --> 53:02.000
If we are to succeed,
it must be him,

53:02.083 --> 53:06.500
for this one speaks truth
to both sides.

53:06.583 --> 53:09.750
He does not lie.

53:09.834 --> 53:13.291
-Do you, Larsen?
-No.

53:14.542 --> 53:16.542
Thank you, Minister Holst.

53:16.625 --> 53:18.792
-We will meet again.
-Thank you.

53:37.083 --> 53:38.500
Nice to have another
professor with us.

53:38.583 --> 53:40.125
Welcome. Hope you
enjoyed your flight.

53:40.208 --> 53:43.041
Such a pleasure
to meet you.
An honor. Truly.

53:43.125 --> 53:46.500
Your security detail
is calling attention.
Send them on ahead.

53:46.583 --> 53:49.166
Yes, um, sorry. Uh...

53:49.250 --> 53:52.250
Hirschfeld:
Are there any details
you'd like us to brief you on?

53:52.333 --> 53:55.500
Obviously, a great
distance still to go,

53:55.583 --> 53:57.458
but as you heard from Yossi,

53:57.542 --> 53:59.917
the progress--
it's been dizzying.

54:00.000 --> 54:04.500
We should be sitting down,
ah?

54:04.583 --> 54:06.458
I have to take a piss.

54:59.375 --> 55:01.959
Gentlemen, I'd like
to introduce Uri Savir,

55:02.041 --> 55:05.417
director general of the
Israeli Foreign Ministry.

55:05.500 --> 55:09.250
Uri Savir, please meet Abu Ala,

55:09.333 --> 55:11.667
and Hassan Asfour.

55:14.709 --> 55:17.792
I am here at
the personal request

55:17.875 --> 55:20.583
and as the voice
of Shimon Peres.

55:26.583 --> 55:30.291
And I am here at
the personal request

55:30.375 --> 55:33.667
and as the voice
of Yasser Arafat.

55:35.792 --> 55:37.625
Welcome to Oslo.

55:46.458 --> 55:48.417
Let us begin.

56:15.417 --> 56:18.125
The idea of this DOP
was yours, yes?

56:18.208 --> 56:20.375
Yes, it was.

56:20.458 --> 56:27.291
What is your official response
to our concrete proposals there?

56:27.375 --> 56:30.834
I have no response
to an unofficial document.

56:33.041 --> 56:36.250
What I have is
a mandate to negotiate

56:36.333 --> 56:39.250
in full with you.

56:39.333 --> 56:41.709
What you have all done
in this room so far

56:41.792 --> 56:44.250
is discuss the idea of peace.

56:44.333 --> 56:48.750
I have been sent here
to try and negotiate
actual peace.

56:48.834 --> 56:50.291
So...

56:52.125 --> 56:55.083
Let us put our cards
on the table.

56:56.542 --> 56:59.041
In my country,

56:59.125 --> 57:02.917
we see you as terrorists
and murderers

57:03.000 --> 57:05.500
who wish to drive us
into the sea.

57:08.667 --> 57:11.917
You killed our athletes
in Munich.

57:12.000 --> 57:15.250
Murdered our school children
in Ma'alot,

57:15.333 --> 57:19.583
invaded us
and spilled our blood
on Yom Kippur,

57:19.667 --> 57:22.750
the highest holy day we have.

57:22.834 --> 57:24.917
So you will understand
when I say

57:25.000 --> 57:30.333
that we do not view you as
ideal partners for peace.

57:34.000 --> 57:37.166
In my country,
we see you as a savage nation,

57:37.250 --> 57:40.500
whose army shoots our children
for sport.

57:42.542 --> 57:45.750
Your people persecuted
for your faith--

57:45.834 --> 57:49.625
murdered in Pogroms,
fled to Palestine,

57:49.709 --> 57:52.625
where you were
left alone to pray,

57:52.709 --> 57:55.834
and strive, and grow strong.

57:55.917 --> 57:58.125
And when you became strong,

57:58.208 --> 57:59.667
you burned our homes,

57:59.750 --> 58:02.709
drove a million people
from Palestine,

58:02.792 --> 58:04.375
and claim to this day

58:04.458 --> 58:08.250
that there was never
such a thing as Palestine!

58:10.250 --> 58:15.792
So, you will understand
our mistrust of you

58:15.875 --> 58:18.709
as ideal partners for peace.

58:23.709 --> 58:25.667
Okay.

58:25.750 --> 58:30.041
Now that we've both
swung our dicks,

58:30.125 --> 58:31.959
let me say this.

58:34.250 --> 58:37.250
We are tired of being
at war with you.

58:40.375 --> 58:44.208
We are committed to ending
the cycle of violence
and enmity.

58:44.291 --> 58:46.417
But I want to be clear.

58:46.500 --> 58:49.500
Israel will not sacrifice
its security.

58:49.583 --> 58:52.500
And you will never have
that security, Mr. Savir,

58:52.583 --> 58:55.625
until you make peace with us.

58:55.709 --> 58:57.291
For our region of the world

58:57.375 --> 59:00.875
will never accept you
until we accept you.

59:10.542 --> 59:13.375
Much of this,
we are willing to discuss.

59:13.458 --> 59:14.875
But let me be clear.

59:14.959 --> 59:17.500
Israel will not negotiate
over the sovereignty

59:17.583 --> 59:18.917
of the city of Jerusalem.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.875
We will never relinquish
our right to Jerusalem,

59:21.959 --> 59:24.667
just as we will never
relinquish our right

59:24.750 --> 59:26.583
to a Palestinian state.

59:26.667 --> 59:28.625
The possibility of
a Palestinian state

59:28.709 --> 59:30.959
without Jerusalem as its capital

59:31.041 --> 59:32.542
is a viable topic,

59:32.625 --> 59:35.542
if you're willing to drop
your further impossible demand

59:35.625 --> 59:37.667
that all issues not
resolved in this DOP

59:37.750 --> 59:40.125
be referred to third-party
international arbitration.

59:40.208 --> 59:42.792
You are Goliath to our David!

59:42.875 --> 59:45.208
A neutral arbitrator
is essential.

59:45.291 --> 59:48.959
Give me one country
that voluntary cedes
national sovereignty,

59:49.041 --> 59:50.583
like you're proposing we do.

59:50.667 --> 59:53.375
The newly formed
European Union
comes to mind.

59:53.458 --> 59:56.750
Not those fucking pansies.
I mean a real country.

59:56.834 --> 59:58.417
We can talk in circles,

59:58.500 --> 1:00:01.000
or we can start to
get something done.

1:00:01.083 --> 1:00:03.750
Now, we are willing to
relinquish control of Gaza--

1:00:03.834 --> 1:00:06.417
Which we will accept,
on condition that you

1:00:06.500 --> 1:00:09.625
relinquish control
of Jericho to us

1:00:09.709 --> 1:00:11.250
at the same time.

1:00:11.333 --> 1:00:12.625
Are you fucking serious?

1:00:12.709 --> 1:00:14.917
Gaza alone would
make us an island,

1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:18.000
surrounded by a sea
of Israeli forces.

1:00:18.083 --> 1:00:19.709
I've been talking of nothing

1:00:19.792 --> 1:00:21.709
but Israel's concern
for our security,

1:00:21.792 --> 1:00:24.500
and now you're asking us
to give you control of a city

1:00:24.583 --> 1:00:27.417
-20 kilometers
from Jerusalem?
-I am talking about

1:00:27.500 --> 1:00:30.333
our city in our West Bank!

1:00:30.417 --> 1:00:33.375
Your country divides
my people in two!

1:00:33.458 --> 1:00:36.250
So we must have
a foothold in Gaza

1:00:36.333 --> 1:00:37.750
and the West Bank!

1:00:37.834 --> 1:00:39.208
Savir:
We'll give you Gaza,

1:00:39.291 --> 1:00:40.875
and when you show
you can stop

1:00:40.959 --> 1:00:43.375
the killing of our
soldiers in Gaza,

1:00:43.458 --> 1:00:44.959
then we'll talk about Jericho.

1:00:45.041 --> 1:00:48.542
That is from
Shimon Peres himself.
Take it or leave it.

1:00:53.667 --> 1:00:55.542
I leave it.

1:01:15.500 --> 1:01:17.917
You two... come with me.

1:01:26.625 --> 1:01:27.917
Alone.

1:02:33.792 --> 1:02:36.417
-Larsen: Uri--
-Shh, shh!

1:02:46.625 --> 1:02:48.792
My God, this day!

1:02:48.875 --> 1:02:51.917
I mean, life is nothing
if not surprising.
Am I right, huh? Huh?

1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:54.291
-Yes, yes.
That's very, very true.
-Yes, absolutely.

1:02:55.333 --> 1:02:57.291
Come. Let's have a dance.

1:03:05.667 --> 1:03:07.458
I'll tell you a secret.

1:03:07.542 --> 1:03:09.875
I was nervous as hell
to meet those two.

1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:13.166
First members of the PLO

1:03:13.250 --> 1:03:15.375
I've ever been
face-to-face with.

1:03:15.458 --> 1:03:17.583
So what do you think of them?

1:03:22.709 --> 1:03:25.375
Not the demons I was expecting.

1:03:25.458 --> 1:03:27.625
This Ahmed--
What do you call him?

1:03:27.709 --> 1:03:29.291
-Abu Ala.
-Abu Ala.

1:03:29.375 --> 1:03:30.709
Mmm-hmm.

1:03:32.125 --> 1:03:34.625
I can do business with this man.

1:03:34.709 --> 1:03:37.166
I think this is going to work.

1:03:53.500 --> 1:03:54.583
It's okay.

1:04:06.125 --> 1:04:08.750
-There's been a leak.
-What?

1:04:08.834 --> 1:04:11.959
Agence France-Presse
is reporting a secret
Norwegian channel

1:04:12.041 --> 1:04:13.875
between Israel and the PLO.

1:04:13.959 --> 1:04:16.667
A small piece, buried,
but our press have read it

1:04:16.750 --> 1:04:19.542
and they want to know
what the hell is going on.

1:04:19.625 --> 1:04:23.250
My God. How are we going
to break this news to Holst?

1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:27.917
We're not going to tell him.

1:04:30.417 --> 1:04:31.875
You'll release a statement

1:04:31.959 --> 1:04:35.333
that Agence France-Presse
is clearly referring to
the meeting

1:04:35.417 --> 1:04:37.166
on the Palestinian
refugee situation

1:04:37.250 --> 1:04:39.375
that we are officially,

1:04:39.458 --> 1:04:42.333
and openly, about to host.

1:04:42.417 --> 1:04:46.417
We're not lying, Jan.

1:04:48.333 --> 1:04:51.375
We're choosing
our words carefully.

1:04:51.458 --> 1:04:53.667
Savir:
I told everyone in my office

1:04:53.750 --> 1:04:55.625
I'm off to Paris
for the weekend.

1:04:57.458 --> 1:04:59.250
I land at De Gaulle,

1:04:59.333 --> 1:05:01.500
take the car to the hotel,

1:05:01.583 --> 1:05:04.625
check in, go to my room.

1:05:04.709 --> 1:05:07.000
After 20 minutes,

1:05:07.083 --> 1:05:10.834
I hang the "Do Not Disturb"
sign on the door,

1:05:10.917 --> 1:05:12.917
and head back to the airport...

1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:15.625
-Incognito.

1:05:15.709 --> 1:05:18.166
The flight from Paris
here to Oslo,

1:05:18.250 --> 1:05:20.375
completely packed...

1:05:20.458 --> 1:05:22.083
with Iranians!

1:05:22.166 --> 1:05:25.250
-Whoa!
-Oh, ho-ho-ho!
What did you do?

1:05:25.333 --> 1:05:27.625
What do you think I did, huh?

1:05:27.709 --> 1:05:31.041
-I shit my pants.
-

1:05:33.333 --> 1:05:35.250
Thank you so much.
Abu Ala, you were right.

1:05:35.333 --> 1:05:37.291
This woman is
a national treasure.

1:05:37.375 --> 1:05:40.333
Qurie:
Aah, just you wait!

1:05:40.417 --> 1:05:42.834
For now, we are approaching

1:05:42.917 --> 1:05:45.000
the hour of the waffles!

1:05:48.625 --> 1:05:50.125
Savir:
Look who's here. Mona!

1:05:50.208 --> 1:05:51.667
Qurie:
Hey, hey, hey!

1:05:51.750 --> 1:05:54.250
-We must toast Mona.
-Yes.

1:05:54.333 --> 1:05:56.417
-No, no, no, no, no--
-We must praise you.

1:05:56.500 --> 1:05:59.500
No, you can't stop us.
We must praise you.

1:05:59.583 --> 1:06:00.792
To Mona.

1:06:00.875 --> 1:06:03.792
Without her, we are nothing.

1:06:03.875 --> 1:06:05.959
-Yes. To Mona.
-To Mona!

1:06:07.250 --> 1:06:10.083
All
Mona! Mona! Mona!

1:06:10.166 --> 1:06:13.583
-Mona! Mona! Mona! Mona!
-

1:06:43.041 --> 1:06:45.333
Qurie:
Last night, in there,

1:06:45.417 --> 1:06:46.792
you said the eventuality

1:06:46.875 --> 1:06:48.500
-of a Palestinian state...
-Savir: I did not!

1:06:48.583 --> 1:06:51.083
-I did not.
-...is a viable topic
for this discussion.

1:06:51.166 --> 1:06:52.792
-Please. Din--
-Possibility of the Palestinian
state is what I said.

1:06:52.875 --> 1:06:54.333
Dinner is about to be served,
gentlemen.

1:06:54.417 --> 1:06:56.000
If you want
to discuss the idea

1:06:56.083 --> 1:06:57.750
of the eventuality
of a Palestinian state,

1:06:57.834 --> 1:07:00.834
then first you must address
our security concerns.

1:07:00.917 --> 1:07:02.834
Your concerns are demands,

1:07:02.917 --> 1:07:04.709
and I will not be demanded to.

1:07:06.208 --> 1:07:08.375
Savir:
We must have proof
that the PLO

1:07:08.458 --> 1:07:10.291
will cease all
terrorist activities

1:07:10.375 --> 1:07:12.500
against all Israeli citizens.
Hassan.

1:07:12.583 --> 1:07:15.333
Hassan.
Hassan! I'm right here.

1:07:15.417 --> 1:07:18.583
You want to say something,
say it to my face.

1:07:20.125 --> 1:07:21.417
Okay.

1:07:22.250 --> 1:07:24.125
You sit there, comrade,

1:07:24.208 --> 1:07:26.458
with your colonial superiority,

1:07:26.542 --> 1:07:30.375
dictating what our future
will or will not be.

1:07:30.458 --> 1:07:32.000
Yet somehow,

1:07:32.083 --> 1:07:34.542
with your intelligence service,
your army,

1:07:34.625 --> 1:07:36.792
your nuclear weapons,

1:07:36.875 --> 1:07:40.208
you are threatened by us.

1:07:40.291 --> 1:07:44.333
So, are you the master
who must be obeyed,

1:07:44.417 --> 1:07:47.083
or the victim who
must be coddled,

1:07:47.166 --> 1:07:49.709
because you cannot be both!

1:07:49.792 --> 1:07:51.375
Tell me something, Hassan.

1:07:51.458 --> 1:07:53.458
Did you get those talking points

1:07:53.542 --> 1:07:56.500
mailed to you from Moscow?

1:07:56.583 --> 1:07:59.166
Or did you copy
them down yourself?

1:07:59.250 --> 1:08:03.000
-Your future will be
dictated by us!
-

1:08:03.083 --> 1:08:05.875
If you think we are
going to roll over

1:08:05.959 --> 1:08:07.834
on the issue of our security,

1:08:07.917 --> 1:08:09.583
you are sorely mistaken!

1:08:09.667 --> 1:08:14.750
Your nation is surrounded
by 350 million of us!

1:08:14.834 --> 1:08:18.375
You will have no security
until we have our dignity.

1:08:18.458 --> 1:08:19.792
Until we have security,

1:08:19.875 --> 1:08:22.417
-you will have nothing.
-Now you reveal
your true face!

1:08:22.500 --> 1:08:25.083
Now we see the scoundrel
you are!

1:08:27.041 --> 1:08:29.291
I'm fine.
It's all right.

1:08:31.959 --> 1:08:33.333
I'm fine.

1:08:37.250 --> 1:08:39.834
Forgive my outburst.

1:08:39.917 --> 1:08:42.166
It was unworthy.

1:08:43.333 --> 1:08:47.834
Please allow me to make amends.

1:09:03.917 --> 1:09:09.959
Perhaps you and I
could walk together.

1:09:10.041 --> 1:09:11.834
If you wish.

1:09:56.709 --> 1:10:00.250
I admire the way you fight.

1:10:03.166 --> 1:10:04.458
Thank you.

1:10:05.959 --> 1:10:10.917
I admire your passion.

1:10:13.291 --> 1:10:16.041
My daughter says, with me,

1:10:16.125 --> 1:10:19.417
passion is another word
for pigheaded.

1:10:19.500 --> 1:10:23.417
She says, "Papa,
all you care about
is being right."

1:10:23.500 --> 1:10:25.500
I say, "Maya,

1:10:25.583 --> 1:10:28.709
"if a man does not fight
for what he believes,

1:10:28.792 --> 1:10:31.125
who is he?"

1:10:31.208 --> 1:10:32.750
Maya?

1:10:33.583 --> 1:10:35.583
Yes. My daughter.

1:10:35.667 --> 1:10:39.583
My daughter is named Maya.

1:10:39.667 --> 1:10:43.417
My youngest.
She is the light
of my life.

1:10:50.750 --> 1:10:54.667
I wish my father
had lived to see this.

1:10:54.750 --> 1:10:57.875
Though he would not have been
crazy about the weather.

1:10:59.333 --> 1:11:02.542
This is a true tragedy
that we were approached

1:11:02.625 --> 1:11:04.291
by the Norwegians,

1:11:04.375 --> 1:11:07.834
and not the Californians.

1:11:12.291 --> 1:11:14.959
-Oh, my God.
Are they laughing?
-Terje.

1:11:15.041 --> 1:11:18.291
If you take one more step,
I swear I will divorce you.

1:11:21.750 --> 1:11:23.917
Is your father still with us?

1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:26.583
My father lives in Abu Dis,

1:11:26.667 --> 1:11:29.083
near Jerusalem.

1:11:29.166 --> 1:11:31.542
Do you want me to take
a letter to him,

1:11:31.625 --> 1:11:32.959
bring a message from you?

1:11:33.041 --> 1:11:34.375
No.

1:11:36.667 --> 1:11:39.458
The day I am able to
leave Tunis and return,

1:11:39.542 --> 1:11:43.291
that is the day
he and I will speak.

1:11:43.375 --> 1:11:45.208
But thank you.

1:11:50.208 --> 1:11:51.959
Savir:
Abu Ala,

1:11:52.041 --> 1:11:55.083
our peoples live in the past.

1:11:58.083 --> 1:12:01.291
Both obsessing over...

1:12:01.375 --> 1:12:04.375
over what we have lost.

1:12:04.458 --> 1:12:07.542
Let us find a way
to live in the present.

1:12:07.625 --> 1:12:09.375
Together.

1:12:21.041 --> 1:12:24.417
We will agree to drop our demand

1:12:24.500 --> 1:12:27.667
that outstanding
quarrels between us

1:12:27.750 --> 1:12:31.792
be referred to third-party
international arbitration.

1:12:35.333 --> 1:12:37.166
And we will agree

1:12:37.250 --> 1:12:41.000
to negotiate
turning over Gaza...

1:12:41.083 --> 1:12:43.083
and Jericho.

1:12:54.291 --> 1:12:56.542
You and I, Abu Ala...

1:12:58.041 --> 1:13:00.333
We are going to
change the world.

1:13:48.375 --> 1:13:50.625
What the fuck is this?

1:13:52.333 --> 1:13:55.041
Who the fuck negotiated this?

1:13:55.125 --> 1:13:57.250
You try negotiating this.

1:13:57.333 --> 1:13:58.667
It's a working document.

1:13:58.750 --> 1:14:02.250
It's a fucking Hanukkah present
to Yasser Arafat.

1:14:02.333 --> 1:14:05.125
-Savir:
This is what Peres wanted.
-Fuck Peres.

1:14:05.208 --> 1:14:07.917
Peres answers to Rabin
just like the rest of us.

1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:12.625
This flies in the face of
40 years of Israeli policy.

1:14:14.500 --> 1:14:16.750
We turn over control of Gaza,

1:14:16.834 --> 1:14:18.917
and Jericho?

1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:23.208
The inclusion of Jerusalem
in Palestinian self-rule?

1:14:23.291 --> 1:14:27.458
-Joel, these are just
talking points--
-Jerusalem.

1:14:27.542 --> 1:14:31.625
Is this why our grandparents
founded this country?

1:14:31.709 --> 1:14:33.375
So we could do this?

1:14:33.458 --> 1:14:36.041
In four months, we've gone
from not even conceiving

1:14:36.125 --> 1:14:37.667
of meeting these people to that.

1:14:37.750 --> 1:14:39.625
Forty years, nothing.

1:14:39.709 --> 1:14:41.583
Now four months, that.

1:14:41.667 --> 1:14:44.542
Every negotiating round,

1:14:44.625 --> 1:14:48.041
my counterpart calls
PLO headquarters in Tunis,

1:14:48.125 --> 1:14:51.291
and speaks directly to Arafat.

1:14:51.375 --> 1:14:53.041
Every point.

1:14:53.125 --> 1:14:55.583
Every concession
these men have made

1:14:55.667 --> 1:14:59.667
has been signed off on
by Arafat.

1:15:03.208 --> 1:15:07.291
Who in the government
knows this document exists?

1:15:11.458 --> 1:15:13.917
The three of us, and Peres.

1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:18.834
And Rabin.

1:15:24.333 --> 1:15:26.417
It's written like mush.

1:15:28.875 --> 1:15:31.542
The janitor in my law firm
would have done a better job.

1:15:31.625 --> 1:15:34.166
Every sentence here
could be read to mean

1:15:34.250 --> 1:15:35.875
anything by either side.

1:15:35.959 --> 1:15:37.667
It's a fucking time bomb.

1:15:37.750 --> 1:15:39.834
So diffuse it, Joel.

1:15:39.917 --> 1:15:43.083
Rabin trusts you,
and you alone, to do it.

1:15:43.166 --> 1:15:46.083
We are not lawyers.
We need your expertise.

1:15:47.291 --> 1:15:50.041
Go through this "mush."

1:15:50.125 --> 1:15:52.667
Figure out if it can be
turned into

1:15:52.750 --> 1:15:55.709
a real binding document or not.

1:15:55.792 --> 1:15:58.875
Nothing more can happen
between Israel and the PLO

1:15:58.959 --> 1:16:01.333
unless you tell us it's a go.

1:16:31.667 --> 1:16:35.000
-Shalom, friends.
-Abu Ala.

1:16:35.083 --> 1:16:37.333
Hassan,
it is my great pleasure

1:16:37.417 --> 1:16:39.750
-to introduce you to--
-They know who I am
and I know who they are.

1:16:39.834 --> 1:16:41.500
We don't have time
for chit-chat.

1:16:41.583 --> 1:16:42.834
I've read the text

1:16:42.917 --> 1:16:44.917
of the joint document
created here,

1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:48.333
and I've come with 200
questions about this document.

1:16:49.333 --> 1:16:51.959
We reject your questions,

1:16:52.041 --> 1:16:55.542
as we reject your tone.

1:16:59.417 --> 1:17:03.500
These questions come directly
from Yitzhak Rabin.

1:17:03.583 --> 1:17:07.375
I am here at his
personal request.

1:17:07.458 --> 1:17:09.375
When you're speaking to me,

1:17:09.458 --> 1:17:13.208
you're speaking to
the prime minister of Israel.

1:17:18.041 --> 1:17:20.041
I have until 0600 hours.

1:17:20.125 --> 1:17:22.250
We'll need to work
through the night.

1:17:22.333 --> 1:17:23.917
Let's get started.

1:17:45.834 --> 1:17:48.458
Do you know who this man is?

1:17:48.542 --> 1:17:52.583
Joel Singer wrote the
military rules of engagement

1:17:52.667 --> 1:17:56.250
the Zionist army used
to crush our people.

1:17:57.875 --> 1:18:02.291
We are now in the boat
with the enemy himself.

1:18:09.542 --> 1:18:13.083
Each of these 200 questions
requires a precise answer.

1:18:13.166 --> 1:18:15.709
When I'm satisfied
with your answer,

1:18:15.792 --> 1:18:18.959
we'll move on to
the next question.

1:18:20.625 --> 1:18:22.792
"If the State of Israel

1:18:22.875 --> 1:18:25.333
"agrees to cede
control of Jericho

1:18:25.417 --> 1:18:27.333
"and its surrounding
territory,

1:18:27.417 --> 1:18:30.542
"will the proposed
Palestinian authority

1:18:30.625 --> 1:18:33.750
"collect Israeli garbage?

1:18:34.875 --> 1:18:39.458
Or only Palestinian garbage?"

1:18:42.792 --> 1:18:45.458
This is your question?

1:18:45.542 --> 1:18:48.333
Well, this is my first question.

1:18:56.917 --> 1:18:59.709
No, we will not collect
Israeli garbage.

1:18:59.792 --> 1:19:03.125
"If the State of Israel agrees
to cede control of Jericho

1:19:03.208 --> 1:19:04.875
"and its surrounding territory,

1:19:04.959 --> 1:19:07.041
"will the proposed
Palestinian authority

1:19:07.125 --> 1:19:09.291
"be prepared to send

1:19:09.375 --> 1:19:11.166
"tax collectors

1:19:11.250 --> 1:19:12.917
into Israeli settlements?"

1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:17.208
Mr. Singer, we did not
fly across the world

1:19:17.291 --> 1:19:20.041
to speak of garbage and taxes.

1:19:20.125 --> 1:19:22.792
Garbage and taxes

1:19:22.875 --> 1:19:25.458
is what a government does.

1:19:25.542 --> 1:19:27.625
If you want us to
give you the authority

1:19:27.709 --> 1:19:30.375
to be a government,
then this joint document

1:19:30.458 --> 1:19:33.542
must spell out exactly how

1:19:33.625 --> 1:19:37.667
you will be a government.

1:19:52.291 --> 1:19:54.542
I must speak with Tunis.

1:20:14.750 --> 1:20:16.667
-

1:20:16.750 --> 1:20:19.208
Coffee?

1:20:19.291 --> 1:20:21.834
How many times
is Mr. Qurie going to do this?

1:20:21.917 --> 1:20:25.125
We've already lost
an hour and a half.

1:20:39.583 --> 1:20:41.750
Singer:
Why are you doing this?

1:20:42.792 --> 1:20:44.750
You and your husband?

1:20:46.291 --> 1:20:48.625
Well, if you were
in our shoes, Mr. Singer,

1:20:48.709 --> 1:20:50.375
wouldn't you do the same?

1:20:50.458 --> 1:20:51.875
No.

1:20:51.959 --> 1:20:54.000
That's why I'm asking.

1:21:03.667 --> 1:21:06.625
Terje and I were touring Gaza.

1:21:06.709 --> 1:21:11.041
Part of my work while
I was stationed in the region.

1:21:11.125 --> 1:21:14.375
We took a wrong turn
down an alley.

1:21:14.458 --> 1:21:16.083
We were fine.

1:21:16.792 --> 1:21:18.583
Others were not.

1:21:22.083 --> 1:21:25.875
There were two boys
facing each other.

1:21:25.959 --> 1:21:29.500
One in uniform.
One in jeans.

1:21:29.583 --> 1:21:32.750
But on their faces,
the same fear.

1:21:32.834 --> 1:21:35.709
The same desperate desire
to be anywhere but here.

1:21:35.792 --> 1:21:38.959
To not be doing this
to the other boy.

1:21:45.709 --> 1:21:47.917
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1:22:18.792 --> 1:22:21.875
I understand our role here.

1:22:21.959 --> 1:22:25.041
But I think you should know...

1:22:25.125 --> 1:22:29.250
Whenever Abu Ala
goes to use the phone
and call Tunis,

1:22:29.333 --> 1:22:31.500
he does not call Tunis.

1:22:33.041 --> 1:22:34.750
Who does he call?

1:22:34.834 --> 1:22:36.291
No one.

1:22:36.375 --> 1:22:40.125
He sits in his room,
staring at the wall.

1:22:40.208 --> 1:22:42.458
When enough time for
a phone call has passed,

1:22:42.542 --> 1:22:45.709
he comes back in
with new instructions.

1:22:47.375 --> 1:22:48.750
Thank you.

1:22:52.709 --> 1:22:55.041
-Trond?
-Yeah?

1:22:56.542 --> 1:23:00.667
Just keep this between
you and me. Yes?

1:23:00.750 --> 1:23:04.417
Don't tell Mona.
I'll take care of it.

1:23:19.041 --> 1:23:22.250
So, the phrase
"Israeli settlements

1:23:22.333 --> 1:23:27.834
abutting the city of Jericho,"
is vague and imprecise.

1:23:27.917 --> 1:23:31.333
-Which settlements, what other--
-Settlements and boundaries,

1:23:31.417 --> 1:23:33.792
as per article four, page 32,

1:23:33.875 --> 1:23:37.250
of the working document
of the official
Washington talks.

1:23:37.333 --> 1:23:39.917
Singer:
Show me the language
of this document.

1:23:42.208 --> 1:23:46.166
My copy of this document
resides here.

1:23:46.250 --> 1:23:48.583
Your copy is your business.

1:23:57.917 --> 1:24:01.000
Question number 200.

1:24:01.083 --> 1:24:03.250
Are you willing to state herein

1:24:03.333 --> 1:24:05.500
that you recognize
the legitimacy

1:24:05.583 --> 1:24:07.458
of the State of Israel?

1:24:13.458 --> 1:24:16.375
We will agree in this document

1:24:16.458 --> 1:24:19.500
to accept the existence
of the State of Israel.

1:24:19.583 --> 1:24:23.250
We know we exist,
and we know you see
that we exist.

1:24:23.333 --> 1:24:25.959
What this document requires
is for you to acknowledge

1:24:26.041 --> 1:24:28.417
the legitimacy of our existence.

1:24:28.500 --> 1:24:30.125
Qurie:
Mr. Singer,

1:24:30.208 --> 1:24:32.375
when you are willing
to state herein

1:24:32.458 --> 1:24:36.875
that the Palestine Liberation
Organization is the official

1:24:36.959 --> 1:24:40.125
voice of the Palestinian people,

1:24:40.208 --> 1:24:43.333
then we will revisit
your legitimacy.

1:24:55.417 --> 1:24:59.208
Your answers to my questions
were clear and direct,

1:24:59.291 --> 1:25:02.291
for which you have
our thanks and our respect.

1:25:02.375 --> 1:25:04.959
On behalf of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin

1:25:05.041 --> 1:25:06.458
and the State of Israel,

1:25:06.542 --> 1:25:10.667
we make this offer
that this back channel

1:25:10.750 --> 1:25:14.875
will become
the official channel.

1:25:19.917 --> 1:25:23.250
But what of the
Washington-sponsored talks?

1:25:23.333 --> 1:25:26.500
They'll continue,
and no one involved
in those talks

1:25:26.583 --> 1:25:29.166
will know that what
they are doing is now

1:25:29.250 --> 1:25:31.667
nothing but a ruse.

1:25:31.750 --> 1:25:35.000
You both will negotiate.

1:25:35.083 --> 1:25:38.500
You and I will write.

1:25:38.583 --> 1:25:44.250
In this room,
we four will forge peace,

1:25:44.333 --> 1:25:46.542
or there will be no peace.

1:25:55.333 --> 1:25:56.875
Lighter.

1:26:00.542 --> 1:26:03.458
-Mona: Jan,
you cannot drop out.
-Yes, I can, Mona.

1:26:03.542 --> 1:26:05.625
And if you have
a shred of sense left,
you will do the same.

1:26:05.709 --> 1:26:07.834
But this process needs you.

1:26:07.917 --> 1:26:10.625
-Look at what has just happened!
-Exactly. Look.

1:26:10.709 --> 1:26:13.125
I mean, my God, it's one thing
for a peace process

1:26:13.208 --> 1:26:14.500
to have a secret back channel.

1:26:14.583 --> 1:26:17.458
Now the actual
peace process itself
is a secret.

1:26:17.542 --> 1:26:20.542
-Yes, I know, but--
-The future of two
peoples is now

1:26:20.625 --> 1:26:22.458
being decided
without accountability,

1:26:22.542 --> 1:26:24.834
without transparency,
by a handful of men

1:26:24.917 --> 1:26:26.667
who have no mandate to do so.

1:26:26.750 --> 1:26:29.542
-But that was always the ca--
-If you continue down this path,

1:26:29.625 --> 1:26:32.458
and the world finds out
what you are all doing,

1:26:32.542 --> 1:26:34.375
there will be riots.

1:26:34.458 --> 1:26:37.041
Blood will be spilled.

1:26:57.834 --> 1:26:59.500
When I was a young man,

1:26:59.583 --> 1:27:02.041
I told my mother
that my dearest wish

1:27:02.125 --> 1:27:04.375
was to become a fighter pilot.

1:27:04.458 --> 1:27:07.041
She said she would allow it
on one condition:

1:27:07.125 --> 1:27:11.208
that I fly very slowly,
and very close to the ground.

1:27:11.291 --> 1:27:14.375
I replied, "But, Mother,
for a pilot to be safe,

1:27:14.458 --> 1:27:16.709
he must fly very fast,
and very high."

1:27:16.792 --> 1:27:19.041
-Peres: I adore your shoes.

1:27:19.125 --> 1:27:21.291
-Larsen: Oh, thank you.
-Peres: Do you have
them stretched,

1:27:21.375 --> 1:27:22.542
or break them in yourself?

1:27:22.625 --> 1:27:24.125
Stretched, of course.

1:27:24.208 --> 1:27:25.792
That way, they fit like a glove.

1:27:25.875 --> 1:27:28.208
Shimon, if you could.

1:27:28.291 --> 1:27:30.583
Arafat, and the PLO.

1:27:30.667 --> 1:27:33.208
Look, if this deal
does not happen,

1:27:33.291 --> 1:27:35.542
the PLO will be so hollowed out,

1:27:35.625 --> 1:27:37.291
so bereft of victories

1:27:37.375 --> 1:27:39.542
it may well cease to exist.

1:27:39.625 --> 1:27:41.250
This, we cannot allow.

1:27:41.333 --> 1:27:44.417
For Israel needs
the PLO to exist.

1:27:44.500 --> 1:27:48.083
Arafat is tricky,
but he is a man.

1:27:48.166 --> 1:27:50.834
And a man aches
for one thing above all:

1:27:50.917 --> 1:27:52.625
his home.

1:27:54.208 --> 1:27:55.959
Tell Uri to tell Abu Ala

1:27:56.041 --> 1:27:58.792
that if Arafat makes
this deal with us,

1:27:58.875 --> 1:28:01.709
I will allow him and the rest
of the PLO leadership

1:28:01.792 --> 1:28:03.166
to return to Gaza.

1:28:03.250 --> 1:28:05.000
Beilin:
Arafat,

1:28:05.083 --> 1:28:06.583
and the PLO in Gaza?

1:28:06.667 --> 1:28:10.250
If we are to be bold,
it must be now.

1:28:10.333 --> 1:28:12.834
Get them all back to Oslo
for one last round.

1:28:12.917 --> 1:28:14.834
And we tell
the Americans nothing.

1:28:14.917 --> 1:28:16.542
But Shimon, nothing?

1:28:16.625 --> 1:28:18.500
I was this close to making peace

1:28:18.583 --> 1:28:20.250
with King Hussein
and the Jordanians,

1:28:20.333 --> 1:28:22.875
until the Americans got wind,
and scuttled it.

1:28:22.959 --> 1:28:24.583
This, they will not scuttle.

1:28:24.667 --> 1:28:28.166
But the Americans could
ask us directly, any moment.

1:28:28.250 --> 1:28:31.375
If they ask any of us,

1:28:31.458 --> 1:28:33.834
we say the back
channel is closed.

1:28:33.917 --> 1:28:35.667
You mean flat-out lie?

1:28:35.750 --> 1:28:39.125
What is a lie but a dream
that could come true?

1:28:40.458 --> 1:28:42.208
Fast and high, my friends.

1:28:42.291 --> 1:28:43.667
It is the only way.

1:28:51.917 --> 1:28:54.750
BBC anchor
As Israel's assault
on Hezbollah continues,

1:28:54.834 --> 1:28:56.542
the refugees
streaming toward Beirut

1:28:56.625 --> 1:28:59.125
have now reached
upwards of 200,000.

1:28:59.208 --> 1:29:01.375
The Palestinians have
spent the day trapped

1:29:01.458 --> 1:29:04.083
between the Lebanese army
and Israel's allies.

1:29:04.166 --> 1:29:06.875
The Palestinians have been
marching for a mile

1:29:06.959 --> 1:29:09.000
through this desolate
nomad's land,

1:29:09.083 --> 1:29:10.458
when they came under fire.

1:29:13.417 --> 1:29:16.333
A tank round landed
only a hundred yards
in front of them...

1:29:16.417 --> 1:29:19.875
-while machine gunfire
whistled over their heads.

1:29:21.250 --> 1:29:23.333
Many of the Palestinians
started to pray

1:29:23.417 --> 1:29:25.208
as the gunfire
echoed around them.

1:29:25.291 --> 1:29:28.625
It was a clear warning
to these men from
the Israeli's proxies

1:29:28.709 --> 1:29:31.125
not to go any closer
to the border.

1:29:31.208 --> 1:29:34.667
Abu Ala, tomorrow
we will finish this.

1:29:34.750 --> 1:29:37.375
BBC anchor
This man was seriously
wounded in the face.

1:29:37.458 --> 1:29:40.375
-We will find a way.
-Reporters took him
to hospital.

1:29:40.458 --> 1:29:42.959
Tonight, the Palestinians
are still on the road,

1:29:43.041 --> 1:29:44.417
out in the open.

1:29:44.500 --> 1:29:46.542
Two Palestinians
were hit by shrapnel

1:29:46.625 --> 1:29:47.875
from the SLA's fire,

1:29:47.959 --> 1:29:49.750
and this evening,
the Lebanese prime minister

1:29:49.834 --> 1:29:52.834
announced he was stopping
any more aid reaching them,

1:29:52.917 --> 1:29:56.041
a clear attempt to increase
the world's concern,

1:29:56.125 --> 1:29:58.417
and the Israeli's
embarrassment.

1:29:58.500 --> 1:30:02.834
Robert Moore, ITN,
on the Israeli-
Lebanese border.

1:30:20.792 --> 1:30:22.542
-It's a disaster!
-Yair, what is?

1:30:22.625 --> 1:30:24.583
-What's going on?
-Months of work ruined

1:30:24.667 --> 1:30:26.208
by that son of a bitch!

1:30:26.291 --> 1:30:27.583
What this Singer has brought,

1:30:27.667 --> 1:30:30.083
it's, it's almost
a complete rewrite!

1:30:30.166 --> 1:30:32.166
The DOP we made together,
it's disappeared.

1:30:32.250 --> 1:30:34.875
Singer took out that we agreed
to give them Jericho,

1:30:34.959 --> 1:30:38.417
and he put in that they agreed
to everything we asked for.

1:30:38.500 --> 1:30:40.000
You have to fix this.

1:30:40.083 --> 1:30:41.667
-Yair, I can't--
-Hirschfeld: No, no!

1:30:41.750 --> 1:30:43.917
Mona, you are the one
they will listen to.

1:30:44.000 --> 1:30:46.834
No. I, I can only facilitate.
I cannot interfere.

1:30:46.917 --> 1:30:49.542
No! You are part of this now.

1:30:51.458 --> 1:30:53.375
It has to be you.

1:30:53.458 --> 1:30:56.625
Go. In. Now!

1:30:57.166 --> 1:30:58.166
How--

1:31:03.000 --> 1:31:04.667
Okay.

1:31:08.709 --> 1:31:11.625
Asfour:
This is not a "joint approach."

1:31:11.709 --> 1:31:14.792
-Larsen: Wait--
-This is an Israeli occupation.

1:31:14.875 --> 1:31:16.542
You have no right
to tell us

1:31:16.625 --> 1:31:19.583
how our army will
deal with our people.

1:31:19.667 --> 1:31:21.375
Singer:
We are not going
one step further

1:31:21.458 --> 1:31:24.000
until you agree,
as written there,

1:31:24.083 --> 1:31:26.625
that the violence ceases
when you are in charge.

1:31:26.709 --> 1:31:29.041
Asfour:
Uh, we are in Tunis.

1:31:29.125 --> 1:31:31.625
Those who are occupied
began the Intifada.

1:31:31.709 --> 1:31:34.125
It is theirs to end
when they see fit.

1:31:34.208 --> 1:31:36.041
Then why the fuck
are we talking to you?

1:31:36.125 --> 1:31:37.709
Joel, I am negotiating, yes?

1:31:37.792 --> 1:31:40.667
-Then let me negotiate!
-Qurie: Uri, why do you
refuse to recognize

1:31:40.750 --> 1:31:43.333
the historic compromises
we have already made?

1:31:43.417 --> 1:31:45.625
You have made? Abu Ala,
we are giving you land.

1:31:45.709 --> 1:31:48.375
-We are shrinking the size
of our country!
-Hey, this is not land

1:31:48.458 --> 1:31:50.041
for you to give,
but to give back!

1:31:50.125 --> 1:31:52.583
This is land you fucking lost
because you invaded us,

1:31:52.667 --> 1:31:53.834
and we kicked
your fucking ass.

1:31:53.917 --> 1:31:56.000
And where in this,
where is Jerusalem?

1:31:56.083 --> 1:31:57.667
You put Jerusalem
back on the table,

1:31:57.750 --> 1:31:59.542
and everything is over.

1:31:59.625 --> 1:32:01.333
You go on like this,

1:32:01.417 --> 1:32:03.750
you will never stop
being the occupier,

1:32:03.834 --> 1:32:05.834
and we will never
stop fighting you!

1:32:05.917 --> 1:32:08.417
Your fighting is killing
your own children!

1:32:08.500 --> 1:32:11.500
Our fighting has forced you

1:32:11.583 --> 1:32:13.959
to stand in this room,
and deal with us!

1:32:14.041 --> 1:32:16.417
My friend, my friend,
listen to me,

1:32:16.500 --> 1:32:18.917
-together we can fix this.
-Singer: He works for me!

1:32:19.000 --> 1:32:21.041
Let us be fucking clear, Joel.
You are here for Yitzhak,

1:32:21.125 --> 1:32:23.125
-I'm here for Shimon.
-You are here with me.

1:32:23.208 --> 1:32:25.041
to make these people,
for once,

1:32:25.125 --> 1:32:26.542
keep their fucking word.

1:32:26.625 --> 1:32:29.667
-Enough! Enough!

1:32:29.750 --> 1:32:31.166
Eh, eh.

1:32:38.834 --> 1:32:41.625
You will accept this document
that we've all agreed to.

1:32:41.709 --> 1:32:44.458
All of us. Or we are done.

1:33:16.542 --> 1:33:18.333
Write this down.

1:33:20.166 --> 1:33:23.583
At exactly 0900 hours,

1:33:23.667 --> 1:33:26.083
28th of July, 1993.

1:33:26.166 --> 1:33:30.291
The Oslo PLO-Israeli
channel was closed.

1:33:47.834 --> 1:33:49.500
Listen to me, please.

1:33:51.625 --> 1:33:55.125
You have fought and killed
each other for 50 years.

1:33:55.208 --> 1:33:59.250
Your mothers,
your daughters,
your sons have died,

1:33:59.333 --> 1:34:01.208
and nothing has changed.

1:34:01.291 --> 1:34:03.542
The world has washed
its hands of this conflict

1:34:03.625 --> 1:34:05.542
because it does not believe

1:34:05.625 --> 1:34:07.917
that you can change.

1:34:12.750 --> 1:34:15.041
No one else is coming
to help you.

1:34:16.250 --> 1:34:19.083
This is up to you.

1:34:19.166 --> 1:34:21.917
You grow more isolated
by the year--

1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:23.542
the day--

1:34:23.625 --> 1:34:26.500
as your soldiers occupy land
you do not even want.

1:34:26.583 --> 1:34:28.375
That you are desperate
to leave.

1:34:28.458 --> 1:34:31.625
And you, you are
stranded in Tunis,

1:34:31.709 --> 1:34:34.417
yet here now, you are
being offered that land.

1:34:34.500 --> 1:34:36.417
A return home.

1:34:37.583 --> 1:34:39.375
To govern yourselves.

1:34:41.000 --> 1:34:42.583
This is your chance.

1:34:44.375 --> 1:34:47.709
You cannot afford
to miss this moment.

1:34:50.250 --> 1:34:53.709
Look at the risks you have
already taken together.

1:34:53.792 --> 1:34:57.208
Now please, sit back down
and find a way.

1:35:07.208 --> 1:35:08.875
Please.

1:35:27.291 --> 1:35:30.208
I'm willing to start over.

1:35:30.291 --> 1:35:31.834
See what we can see.

1:36:03.750 --> 1:36:05.917
Begin with article eight.

1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:09.667
They are clearly open
to meeting you halfway
on this issue.

1:36:25.959 --> 1:36:28.959
Savir:
End of article eight.

1:36:29.041 --> 1:36:33.291
The sentence,
"Israel will continue to carry
all responsibilities,"

1:36:33.375 --> 1:36:35.083
must be followed
by the words

1:36:35.166 --> 1:36:37.458
"for defending against
external threats

1:36:37.542 --> 1:36:39.000
or terrorist threats."

1:36:39.083 --> 1:36:40.917
Qurie:
In article eight,
we will accept

1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:45.542
"external threats,"
but not "terrorist threats."

1:36:48.750 --> 1:36:50.166
Agreed.

1:37:14.792 --> 1:37:20.583
The long-standing
UN Resolution 242 and 338

1:37:20.667 --> 1:37:23.166
criticizing
the Israeli occupation

1:37:23.250 --> 1:37:26.417
must be included
in this document.

1:37:26.500 --> 1:37:28.583
That, we categorically reject.

1:37:28.667 --> 1:37:30.583
But if you are willing
to postpone discussion

1:37:30.667 --> 1:37:34.083
-on the future of
Israeli settlements--
-No. We will not.

1:37:43.917 --> 1:37:45.250
But,

1:37:45.333 --> 1:37:48.166
the right to return
for those displaced

1:37:48.250 --> 1:37:49.834
in the '67 war,

1:37:49.917 --> 1:37:55.375
this, we agree to postpone
to a later date.

1:37:58.959 --> 1:38:00.625
Savir:
And if you are willing to accept

1:38:00.709 --> 1:38:03.917
our control of border security,

1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:08.458
we will withdraw
all our forces from Gaza,

1:38:08.542 --> 1:38:11.500
and Jericho, at the same time.

1:38:22.166 --> 1:38:24.834
The city of Jerusalem
will be capital for both.

1:38:24.917 --> 1:38:26.458
Savir and Singer:
No!

1:38:33.375 --> 1:38:35.125
-Larsen.
-Beilin
Terje.

1:38:35.208 --> 1:38:38.000
This is the son calling with
a message from the father.

1:38:40.333 --> 1:38:42.250
The father says you need
to assemble your team

1:38:42.333 --> 1:38:45.959
and fly tomorrow in secret
to Stockholm, Sweden.

1:38:46.041 --> 1:38:47.667
Tomorrow night,
the father will be attending

1:38:47.750 --> 1:38:50.208
a state dinner over there,
and after dinner,

1:38:50.291 --> 1:38:54.375
he will meet you and your team
at the royal guest house.

1:38:54.458 --> 1:38:58.291
And... then he will make it.

1:39:02.500 --> 1:39:03.959
Make what?

1:39:05.333 --> 1:39:06.709
Peace.

1:39:08.125 --> 1:39:11.125
With those across the sea.

1:39:11.208 --> 1:39:13.750
We are going to finish it,
Terje.

1:39:13.834 --> 1:39:15.500
Tomorrow night.

1:40:34.583 --> 1:40:39.208
So, how long will you be
with Mr. Peres tonight?

1:40:39.291 --> 1:40:42.208
As long as Mr. Peres wishes.

1:40:45.166 --> 1:40:46.875
Terje:
Um, uh,

1:40:46.959 --> 1:40:49.375
perhaps we could get
something to eat?

1:40:49.458 --> 1:40:51.792
It's late.
Could that be arranged?

1:40:52.792 --> 1:40:54.625
The kitchen is closed.

1:40:56.166 --> 1:40:58.375
Oh. Mr. Foreign Minister.

1:40:58.458 --> 1:41:00.333
How was your function?

1:41:00.417 --> 1:41:01.959
Long.

1:41:02.041 --> 1:41:03.750
May I get you something
from the kitchen?

1:41:03.834 --> 1:41:05.667
No, thank you.

1:41:05.750 --> 1:41:08.834
This couple is not
on the official list

1:41:08.917 --> 1:41:10.458
for the guest house.

1:41:10.542 --> 1:41:12.125
Good.

1:41:12.917 --> 1:41:14.250
You may leave us.

1:41:21.583 --> 1:41:25.083
Holst is still
at the reception,
but he's coming.

1:41:25.166 --> 1:41:28.000
This is the latest draft,
with Singer's markings.

1:41:29.291 --> 1:41:31.667
Let's get started.

1:41:31.750 --> 1:41:34.583
But where are the Palestinians?

1:41:34.667 --> 1:41:36.625
The Palestinians are not coming.

1:41:36.709 --> 1:41:38.375
We are doing this
on the phone.

1:41:38.458 --> 1:41:40.083
You will ring Tunis.

1:41:40.166 --> 1:41:44.125
Tell them I'm calling,
and have them put
Arafat on the line.

1:41:44.208 --> 1:41:47.125
Is the PLO leadership
expecting your call?

1:41:47.208 --> 1:41:49.166
The PLO leadership

1:41:49.250 --> 1:41:52.583
has never spoken to
the Israeli leadership,
ever.

1:41:52.667 --> 1:41:54.542
But the chairman and I
are the only ones

1:41:54.625 --> 1:41:58.625
who can make the necessary
and painful final compromises.

1:41:58.709 --> 1:42:02.083
Since he and I can have
no contact of any kind,

1:42:02.166 --> 1:42:05.792
we will use Holst
as our intermediary.

1:42:05.875 --> 1:42:08.500
Now dial Tunis,
and find Arafat.

1:42:08.583 --> 1:42:10.417
The night is not young,
my friends,

1:42:10.500 --> 1:42:12.417
and we have a long way to go.

1:42:17.750 --> 1:42:21.083
"Dial Tunis"?
Like there's one
phone number there?

1:42:21.166 --> 1:42:24.333
This is Arafat.
He's not reachable by phone.

1:42:24.417 --> 1:42:25.709
Oh...

1:42:25.792 --> 1:42:27.917
-Where is Abu Ala?
-I don't know.

1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:30.417
-Is he in Tunis?
-I don't know, Mona.

1:42:30.500 --> 1:42:32.208
What are you doing?

1:42:32.291 --> 1:42:34.250
I'm going to call
every possible number

1:42:34.333 --> 1:42:35.917
where Abu Ala could be staying.

1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:37.917
He'll know how to reach Arafat.

1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:39.834
Oh, my God.

1:43:13.875 --> 1:43:16.041
Christ! It's almost midnight.

1:43:16.125 --> 1:43:17.834
We are running out of time.

1:43:17.917 --> 1:43:19.792
Mr. Peres has retired
for this evening,

1:43:19.875 --> 1:43:21.625
so this office is closed.

1:43:21.709 --> 1:43:23.625
No, Mr. Peres will be
joining us again

1:43:23.709 --> 1:43:25.583
in a few moments.

1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:30.125
Uh, may we use
your copy machine?

1:43:30.208 --> 1:43:32.875
-The copy machine is closed.
-Terje: Thank you.

1:43:35.458 --> 1:43:37.083
Qurie
Hello?

1:43:37.166 --> 1:43:40.542
-Terje.
-Qurie: Can you hear me?

1:43:40.625 --> 1:43:43.041
-Can you hear me?
-Yes, yes, Puntoffle.

1:43:43.125 --> 1:43:46.291
Listen to me.
I'm calling for the father.

1:43:46.375 --> 1:43:49.208
He wishes to speak
with your grandfather.

1:43:49.291 --> 1:43:54.083
He wants to finish it.
On this phone. Now.
Tonight.

1:43:54.917 --> 1:43:56.291
Do you understand?

1:43:56.375 --> 1:43:58.875
Qurie:
Yes, I do.
I will call you back.

1:43:58.959 --> 1:44:00.542
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't call me back.

1:44:00.625 --> 1:44:02.166
Qurie:
I will call you back.

1:44:02.250 --> 1:44:04.208
-Puntoffle, listen--
-

1:44:15.583 --> 1:44:18.291
I'm sorry. It's stuck
in the copy machine,

1:44:18.375 --> 1:44:19.750
and I can't get it out.

1:44:19.834 --> 1:44:21.166
Well, then ask her for help.

1:44:21.250 --> 1:44:24.375
But she said
we could not use it.

1:44:25.333 --> 1:44:27.125
I-I will fix it.

1:44:34.667 --> 1:44:36.917
Qurie
Larsen, I am here.

1:44:37.000 --> 1:44:39.208
Puntoffle. Thank God.

1:44:39.291 --> 1:44:41.667
Qurie:
I am with the grandfather.

1:44:41.750 --> 1:44:43.166
Terje:
Excellent.

1:44:43.250 --> 1:44:45.875
Qurie:
And with the entire
ruling council.

1:44:48.583 --> 1:44:51.750
We have just informed them
of our channel,

1:44:51.834 --> 1:44:54.583
and what is to now transpire.

1:44:54.667 --> 1:44:58.458
Wow. Okay.
And, uh... and...

1:44:58.542 --> 1:45:01.542
The news.
How are they taking it?

1:45:03.250 --> 1:45:05.625
Qurie:
Let's move on.

1:45:05.709 --> 1:45:08.959
The grandfather's English
is not as he wishes.

1:45:09.041 --> 1:45:13.000
Therefore, he asks
that I speak for and to him.

1:45:13.083 --> 1:45:14.417
I understand.

1:45:15.625 --> 1:45:19.458
Qurie:
And I ask that you, Larsen,

1:45:19.542 --> 1:45:21.750
are the one I speak to.

1:45:21.834 --> 1:45:25.542
For here,
what men begin together,

1:45:25.625 --> 1:45:27.917
men must finish together.

1:45:31.875 --> 1:45:33.917
I'll get Shimon.

1:45:47.041 --> 1:45:49.208
It is a total breach
of protocol.

1:45:49.291 --> 1:45:50.875
If you are uneasy
in any way--

1:45:50.959 --> 1:45:53.291
I understand.
And it is.

1:45:53.375 --> 1:45:56.000
But Johan Jorgen,
I think we must acknowledge

1:45:56.083 --> 1:45:58.041
that now we are all
very far beyond

1:45:58.125 --> 1:45:59.917
the bounds of protocol.

1:46:11.667 --> 1:46:13.125
Let us begin.

1:46:21.250 --> 1:46:23.625
The father repeats his demand

1:46:23.709 --> 1:46:25.959
regarding future settlements.

1:46:26.041 --> 1:46:27.291
Qurie:
No!

1:46:27.375 --> 1:46:31.792
Not unless UN Resolutions
242 and 338

1:46:31.875 --> 1:46:34.208
are to be included
in this document!

1:46:34.291 --> 1:46:35.709
-No!
-

1:46:35.792 --> 1:46:37.417
-Okay.
-Qurie: Official boundaries

1:46:37.500 --> 1:46:39.333
of all Israeli settlements

1:46:39.417 --> 1:46:40.875
abutting the city of Jericho

1:46:40.959 --> 1:46:43.959
must be set by both parties.

1:46:44.041 --> 1:46:46.417
Larsen:
The father says to tell
the grandfather

1:46:46.500 --> 1:46:49.625
the little country has
already compromised
on this issue.

1:46:49.709 --> 1:46:51.375
Let me pass that on.

1:46:51.458 --> 1:46:52.959
The grandfather says yes.

1:46:53.041 --> 1:46:55.041
Yes. He's, he's willing
to accept that.

1:46:55.125 --> 1:46:57.959
Yes? All right.
Good. Good. Thank you.

1:47:01.458 --> 1:47:03.583
Ugh. Um...

1:47:03.667 --> 1:47:07.041
the grandfather says
he's going to bed.

1:47:07.125 --> 1:47:10.375
Call him when--
when you change your mind.

1:47:10.458 --> 1:47:13.208
-Aah!
-Qurie: We will accept
that their forces

1:47:13.291 --> 1:47:16.375
be in charge of
border security.

1:47:16.458 --> 1:47:20.291
But our forces must
have joint control

1:47:20.375 --> 1:47:21.667
of all checkpoints.

1:47:21.750 --> 1:47:24.208
Tell him our checkpoints,
our soldiers.

1:47:24.291 --> 1:47:25.750
We will not cede this point.

1:47:25.834 --> 1:47:28.834
Qurie:
Tell him we will burn
this document

1:47:28.917 --> 1:47:33.834
and wage war upon you
until the last days of time!

1:47:36.041 --> 1:47:40.333
But also that we are open
to a counterproposal.

1:47:57.208 --> 1:47:59.208
We will accept

1:47:59.291 --> 1:48:03.208
that the Palestine
Liberation Organization...

1:48:04.375 --> 1:48:07.041
is the official voice

1:48:07.125 --> 1:48:09.375
of the Palestinian people.

1:48:12.375 --> 1:48:15.875
Qurie:
We will accept...

1:48:18.166 --> 1:48:21.875
the legitimacy of
the State of Israel.

1:48:27.375 --> 1:48:31.625
Jerusalem will remain
solely the capital of Israel.

1:48:31.709 --> 1:48:33.917
-Qurie: No!
-Non-negotiable!

1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:36.041
Qurie:
Larsen! Larsen!

1:48:36.125 --> 1:48:38.458
This is not the bluffing!

1:48:42.959 --> 1:48:44.583
Larsen:
Wait.

1:49:06.917 --> 1:49:11.792
In the name of
constructive ambiguity,

1:49:18.959 --> 1:49:22.959
we will accept that

1:49:24.125 --> 1:49:28.709
in the final stage
of further negotiations,

1:49:28.792 --> 1:49:31.125
the future of Jerusalem

1:49:31.208 --> 1:49:33.583
will be addressed.

1:49:36.750 --> 1:49:40.792
Qurie:
We accept this document.

1:49:46.542 --> 1:49:48.250
As do we.

1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:24.834
Abu Ala...

1:50:26.333 --> 1:50:28.917
what is that sound?

1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:32.083
Qurie:
They are crying.

1:50:32.875 --> 1:50:34.834
All of them.

1:50:35.709 --> 1:50:37.417
They did not think

1:50:37.500 --> 1:50:40.375
they would live
to see this day.

1:51:17.125 --> 1:51:20.667
Rabin:
Let me say to you,
the Palestinians,

1:51:20.750 --> 1:51:23.834
we are destined
to live together,

1:51:23.917 --> 1:51:27.583
on the same soil,
in the same land.

1:51:27.667 --> 1:51:32.166
We, the soldiers
who have returned
from battles

1:51:32.250 --> 1:51:34.542
stained with blood;

1:51:34.625 --> 1:51:38.000
we, who have
come from a land

1:51:38.083 --> 1:51:41.709
where parents
bury their children;

1:51:41.792 --> 1:51:44.625
we, who have
fought against you,

1:51:44.709 --> 1:51:46.917
the Palestinians,

1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:49.041
we say to you today,

1:51:49.125 --> 1:51:52.542
in a loud and a clear voice,

1:51:52.625 --> 1:51:56.291
enough of blood and tears.

1:51:56.375 --> 1:51:59.375
-Enough.

1:52:17.125 --> 1:52:18.875
Mona:
"The Oslo channel

1:52:18.959 --> 1:52:22.083
"began with the hopes
of creating a dialogue

1:52:22.166 --> 1:52:24.458
"between adversaries.

1:52:26.625 --> 1:52:30.041
"Already, this process
has succeeded

1:52:30.125 --> 1:52:32.625
"beyond anything we imagined:

1:52:34.208 --> 1:52:37.542
"The establishment
of a Palestinian state.

1:52:37.625 --> 1:52:40.083
"Movement towards
a peace treaty

1:52:40.166 --> 1:52:42.834
between Israel
and Jordan."

1:52:45.917 --> 1:52:48.500
"And yet, undoubtedly,

1:52:48.583 --> 1:52:51.625
objection to this process
is coming."

1:53:12.542 --> 1:53:19.333
I am very shocked for this
awful and terrible crime...

1:53:19.417 --> 1:53:25.834
against one of the brave
leaders of Israel.

1:53:25.917 --> 1:53:27.875
And a peacemaker.

1:53:55.208 --> 1:53:57.458
Mona:
"For the efforts
of any peoples

1:53:57.542 --> 1:54:01.333
"to bridge their hatreds
is always met by some

1:54:01.417 --> 1:54:03.750
"with fierce resistance.

1:54:05.959 --> 1:54:10.667
"But whatever
mistakes were made,

1:54:10.750 --> 1:54:15.875
"whatever unintended events
have been unleashed,

1:54:15.959 --> 1:54:19.583
"I still believe this channel
was worth doing.

1:54:23.500 --> 1:54:27.500
"For if we do not sit
across from our enemies,

1:54:27.583 --> 1:54:29.667
"and hear them,

1:54:29.750 --> 1:54:33.083
"and see them
as human beings,

1:54:33.166 --> 1:54:35.583
what will become of us?"
