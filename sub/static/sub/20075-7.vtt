- Caramel milkshake. Ah-la-la-la-la.

00:17.834 --> 00:20.746
You stay the fuck away from me.

00:20.752 --> 00:23.400
If anyone has an issue
with the way I run things,

00:23.406 --> 00:25.056
now's your chance to spit it out.

00:28.564 --> 00:30.665
- (cable ties zip)
- Arrrgh!

00:30.671 --> 00:33.057

00:39.475 --> 00:42.131
(gasps) Oh, fuck! Oh!

00:42.555 --> 00:45.574
Ferguson took out the
trash when Kaz couldn't.

00:45.580 --> 00:47.016
CHANG: Yeah, fuck Kaz!

00:47.022 --> 00:48.961
- INMATES: Top Dog!
- FRANKY: Get off!

00:48.967 --> 00:50.410
- LIZ: Yeah.
- Top Dog!

00:50.727 --> 00:52.015
Top Dog!

00:52.463 --> 00:56.823
Top Dog! Top Dog! Top Dog!

01:46.204 --> 01:50.219
If this was an isolated incident
I might be able to understand...

01:50.225 --> 01:52.178
but Smith has been murdered,

01:52.280 --> 01:54.280
Stevens bashed so badly she can't walk,

01:54.286 --> 01:57.279
and now a prisoner has
had their tongue cut out,

01:57.285 --> 02:00.396
right under our noses without
anybody, not one of you,

02:00.402 --> 02:02.845
noticing anything.
How is that possible?!

02:02.851 --> 02:05.538
Clearly the attack on Gambaro
was Ferguson's handiwork

02:05.544 --> 02:07.730
Now that she is Top Dog we
have to be twice as vigilant.

02:07.736 --> 02:09.830
This is just a taste of
what she is capable of.

02:09.836 --> 02:11.932
(tittering)

02:14.691 --> 02:17.190
Oh, if only the Department
found it so amusing.

02:18.105 --> 02:21.387
One more serious
incident, heads will roll.

02:22.590 --> 02:23.960
And it won't be mine.

02:24.540 --> 02:27.032
Get back to work, and take
down the fucking decorations!

02:28.141 --> 02:30.107
- Bring Ferguson to my office.
- Okay.

02:49.431 --> 02:51.721
Well, I hope Kaz is fuckin' happy.

02:52.213 --> 02:55.136
We warned her if she didn't
bash Juice someone else would've.

02:55.142 --> 02:56.346
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well bashin's

02:56.352 --> 02:57.729
one thing but that tongue...

02:57.735 --> 02:59.143
- Yeah.
- Oh, I can't get that image

02:59.149 --> 03:00.349
- out of my head.
- Nuh.

03:00.355 --> 03:02.254
Can they sew a tongue
back on, do you reckon?

03:02.260 --> 03:03.932
Sh-sh-sh-sh, she's looking.

03:06.657 --> 03:08.387
What's Tina's problem?

03:09.906 --> 03:12.803
Nah, you'll need to be more specific.

03:13.296 --> 03:15.405
She won't sell me any more gear.

03:16.090 --> 03:17.901
Well, I told her not to.

03:19.101 --> 03:20.301
Why?

03:20.695 --> 03:25.273
You junkies have such a tenuous
understanding of cause and affect.

03:25.279 --> 03:28.968
I seem to recall that you attacked
me with a billiard ball in a sock.

03:28.974 --> 03:30.280
Does that ring a bell?

03:31.375 --> 03:35.262
(steam press whooshing)

03:39.587 --> 03:41.795
(trolley wheels rattling)

03:41.990 --> 03:43.324
What was that about?

03:44.396 --> 03:45.601
Nothing.

03:45.607 --> 03:47.067
Didn't look like nuffin'.

03:47.252 --> 03:49.159
Nothing for you to worry about.

03:52.174 --> 03:54.583
(gentle music)

03:55.557 --> 03:59.526
(steam press whooshes)

03:59.831 --> 04:01.314
I reckon she's back on the drugs.

04:01.320 --> 04:03.211
Oh, look we don't know
that for sure, love.

04:03.217 --> 04:05.228
She gave the Freak her
dessert, that's fucked.

04:05.234 --> 04:07.508
- DOREEN: How can she even look at her?
- BOOMER: I dunno.

04:07.514 --> 04:08.736
- LIZ: Mmm...
- (Boomer chuckles wryly)

04:08.742 --> 04:10.722
- God, I dunno.
- Hey, Allie?

04:11.545 --> 04:13.336
- What's going on?
- Ah...

04:13.342 --> 04:16.850
we just... we're just havin' a bit
of a family conference, that's all.

04:16.856 --> 04:18.512
- About...?
- Well, come and...

04:18.519 --> 04:20.517
come and have a chat with us. Come on.

04:23.902 --> 04:25.102
There you go.

04:27.119 --> 04:28.319
What's up?

04:30.694 --> 04:33.796
How are you going, love?
Are you... you okay?

04:33.802 --> 04:35.623
Yeah, good. Why?

04:37.024 --> 04:38.761
You're not your normal self, Allie.

04:38.767 --> 04:40.269
What... what are you
doin' back on the gear?

04:40.275 --> 04:41.863
- Like after everything that Bea
- Oh...

04:41.869 --> 04:43.156
- done for ya.
- geez, Booms, you're like a

04:43.162 --> 04:45.187
- bloody sledgehammer.
- Eh? Well...

04:45.193 --> 04:47.923
We're just trying to
understand what's going on,

04:47.929 --> 04:49.129
- that's all.
- LIZ: Mm-hm.

04:49.135 --> 04:50.656
Just lookin' out for ya, love.

04:50.662 --> 04:52.215
Bea would've hated seein' you back on

04:52.221 --> 04:54.660
- on the gear.
- Don't tell me what Bea would've hated!

04:54.835 --> 04:56.859
I fucking know better than any of you!

04:56.865 --> 05:00.100
- We're not saying you don't know, Al.
- Then stop pointing the finger!

05:01.272 --> 05:03.414
I haven't forgotten her, okay.

05:03.998 --> 05:05.514
I never will.

05:07.093 --> 05:09.154
Thanks for the family ambush!

05:09.939 --> 05:11.139
(door closes)

05:11.861 --> 05:14.002
- Clearly she doesn't want our help.
- (moody music)

05:14.008 --> 05:16.477
LIZ: Yeah, but she's
still part of our family

05:16.483 --> 05:18.667
DOREEN: I don't know how
she can suck up to the Freak.

05:18.673 --> 05:20.666
BOOMER: It's 'cause she's a junkie, eh?

05:23.051 --> 05:26.051
- (music darkens)
- (door beeps unlocked)

05:26.855 --> 05:28.411
(faint echoed drum beat flourish)

05:29.551 --> 05:31.704
- (faint whooshing flourish)
- (door closes)

05:31.710 --> 05:34.331
A tongue in a box. What the fuck, Joan?!

05:34.337 --> 05:37.152
Just stop your whining.
Our plan is working.

05:37.158 --> 05:39.219
Let's just focus now
on making you Governor.

05:40.815 --> 05:43.067
Vera's job is hanging by a thread.

05:43.157 --> 05:45.364
We only need to give
things a little push.

05:45.666 --> 05:47.978
Just keep your drugs
coming thick and fast.

05:48.056 --> 05:50.095
- It's only a matter of time.
- (door beeps unlocked)

05:50.242 --> 05:53.578
(bongo drums added to music)

05:54.068 --> 05:55.268
(music ends)

05:57.336 --> 05:58.536
(knocking)

05:59.360 --> 06:01.164
I've got Ferguson for you, Governor.

06:02.344 --> 06:03.544
Don't sit.

06:04.355 --> 06:05.876
That'll be all, Mr Stewart.

06:07.062 --> 06:08.262
(door closes)

06:08.268 --> 06:11.494
So, is this the meeting where we
plan how we're gonna work together,

06:11.539 --> 06:13.828
- for the benefit of the women?
- No.

06:14.113 --> 06:16.517
This is the one where I
suspend all your privileges.

06:16.621 --> 06:18.222
On what grounds?

06:18.425 --> 06:20.412
I know it was you.

06:21.207 --> 06:22.916
- (inhales)
- (ominous music)

06:23.190 --> 06:24.582
What's the legal expression?

06:24.588 --> 06:26.913
It's um, it's on the tip of my tongue.

06:27.014 --> 06:29.709
- (clicks mouth)
- (faint grating flourish)

06:29.715 --> 06:31.688
Burden of proof?

06:31.694 --> 06:33.913
Take it up with the Ombudsman.

06:35.961 --> 06:37.747
If you try anything...

06:38.047 --> 06:39.976
I will have you slotted...

06:39.982 --> 06:41.809
indefinitely.

06:44.074 --> 06:46.410
You're on notice. Mr Stewart?!

06:46.675 --> 06:47.875
(door opens)

06:49.596 --> 06:50.929
Get her out of here.

06:52.334 --> 06:55.334
(music intensifies)

06:58.724 --> 06:59.924
(door closes)

07:00.423 --> 07:01.790
- (music ends)
- (inhales shakily)

07:01.796 --> 07:03.663
- (door beeps unlocked)
- _

07:04.079 --> 07:05.592
I'll take her back, Nurse.

07:05.782 --> 07:07.211
Okay. Sure.

07:07.217 --> 07:08.998
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

07:09.496 --> 07:11.835
- How's the arm?
- Getting there.

07:15.408 --> 07:17.338
(exhales deeply)

07:17.807 --> 07:21.010
She is going to tear those
women to shreds, piece by piece,

07:21.016 --> 07:22.544
(hushed) and I feel sick about it.

07:22.550 --> 07:24.156
Well, I did try to warn you.

07:24.162 --> 07:27.183
She would have become Top
Dog no matter what I did.

07:27.250 --> 07:28.877
Then do something about it.

07:28.883 --> 07:31.320
Like what? The women are frozen in fear.

07:31.326 --> 07:32.526
Kaz...

07:32.766 --> 07:35.177
- win them over.
- What do you suggest?

07:35.183 --> 07:37.461
Okay, sign up for peer worker.

07:37.734 --> 07:39.340
Now, that's a start.

07:39.442 --> 07:41.360
Put your principle into good use.

07:42.645 --> 07:44.878
Not the worst idea I've ever heard.

07:45.240 --> 07:47.742
Do you think you can help me get
to the bottom of the drug supply?

07:47.748 --> 07:49.056
(sighs)

07:49.147 --> 07:50.347
How?

07:50.967 --> 07:53.240
Well, Ferguson's propped
up by the dealers...

07:53.246 --> 07:56.240
we get rid of the
drugs, kills two birds.

07:56.740 --> 07:58.838
There is an officer
involved, I'm telling you.

07:58.844 --> 08:02.932
- There is a fucking officer involved.
- There's no officer, okay?

08:02.938 --> 08:05.009
It'll be a contract in
the laundry or the kitchen.

08:05.015 --> 08:06.293
Okay, prove it.

08:06.901 --> 08:08.101
(sighs quietly)

08:08.300 --> 08:09.612
So, she was trollin' ya?

08:09.618 --> 08:11.613
Yeah, definitely. You have no idea.

08:11.619 --> 08:14.685
So what, then you found out where
she lived and you bashed her?

08:14.888 --> 08:17.777
She asked for it. It was
hateful shit she was posting.

08:17.783 --> 08:20.025
So, it's mitigating circumstances.

08:20.737 --> 08:22.814
- FRANKY: Mmm...
- VERA: Farah?

08:23.117 --> 08:25.519
I'd like a word with
Doyle, alone please.

08:31.228 --> 08:32.428
Ms Bennett.

08:34.315 --> 08:35.515
(door closes)

08:35.994 --> 08:37.485
How's your case coming?

08:37.491 --> 08:39.477
- It's not mine, it's Iman's.
- Hmm.

08:39.484 --> 08:41.719
Might be an argument
for a reduced sentence.

08:41.725 --> 08:42.924
VERA: (hushed) Okay.

08:42.931 --> 08:44.890
I've always admired that about you...

08:45.686 --> 08:47.674
your willingness to
help the other women,

08:47.680 --> 08:49.780
despite what's going
on in your own life.

08:49.866 --> 08:53.069
Well, that's me, patron
saint of lost causes.

08:53.702 --> 08:54.902
(inhales)

08:55.682 --> 08:57.916
You know, there's a way
you could really help them.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.028
Take down Ferguson.

09:02.328 --> 09:03.957
I'd rather keep my tongue,

09:04.121 --> 09:06.153
- for obvious reasons.
- Oh, so it was her?

09:06.159 --> 09:07.762
Well, anyone with half
a brain can see that,

09:07.768 --> 09:09.249
why haven't you shifted
her off to the nuthouse yet?

09:09.255 --> 09:10.843
Because the people with half a brain

09:10.849 --> 09:12.554
don't have the evidence to prove it.

09:12.763 --> 09:14.551
So, you want me to fix
your problem for you?

09:14.557 --> 09:16.146
Ah, it's not just my problem.

09:16.949 --> 09:20.447
She's making life hell for
everyone, including your friends.

09:21.568 --> 09:22.768
(moody music)

09:22.774 --> 09:25.777
Nah, well you can tell Proctor.
She's all about the women.

09:28.222 --> 09:31.833
You are the only one
who can take on Ferguson.

09:31.839 --> 09:33.972
The women will rally around you.

09:35.347 --> 09:37.146
You're not draggin' me back in.

09:45.752 --> 09:48.258
(whooshing flourish)

09:49.737 --> 09:50.937
(music ends)

09:52.331 --> 09:53.531
What do you want?

09:53.537 --> 09:55.249
I need to see Ferguson.

09:55.255 --> 09:56.727
Wouldn't advise it.

09:57.318 --> 09:58.518
What is it?

09:58.624 --> 10:01.521
Can you tell Tina it's okay, please?

10:01.988 --> 10:03.700
I feel I'm having déjÃ  vu.

10:03.706 --> 10:05.205
I've got cash, how much do you want?

10:05.206 --> 10:07.190
Here, I've got it with me.
I'll pay you whatever you want.

10:07.197 --> 10:09.082
- How much?
- I wish it were that simple.

10:09.088 --> 10:10.304
(hushed) Oh, fuck!

10:10.310 --> 10:12.419
What do you want? What do
you want? You want me to beg?

10:12.520 --> 10:15.329
You want me to beg in front of
everyone? Okay, fine. I'm begging you.

10:15.335 --> 10:17.028
- I'm begging you. Please!
- INMATE 1: Fucking junkie.

10:17.034 --> 10:18.942
- Please, please, I need it.
- INMATE 2: Loser.

10:18.948 --> 10:20.751
- Please! Please! Please!
- Get...

10:20.757 --> 10:22.353
- Please, I need it! Please!
- (inmates laughing)

10:22.359 --> 10:24.567
You know, as entertaining as
it might be to watch you grovel,

10:24.573 --> 10:27.288
the problem is one of supply and demand.

10:27.898 --> 10:30.992
Product is scarce, prices skyrocketing.

10:30.998 --> 10:32.892
Well, go to my cell then,
take whatever you want.

10:32.898 --> 10:34.295
You can have whatever you want.

10:36.679 --> 10:40.090
I doubt that you would have
anything of value to offer.

10:41.501 --> 10:42.701
Get her out!

10:42.707 --> 10:45.409
(Allie sighs) Okay, I'm going.

10:45.415 --> 10:48.807
(rustling of money)

10:52.101 --> 10:53.312
I might check it out.

10:53.318 --> 10:54.711
- See what you got.
- (ominous tone)

10:55.992 --> 10:58.992
(urgent music with drum accents)

11:10.242 --> 11:12.562
- One, two, three, four...
- (knocking)

11:13.046 --> 11:14.604
Oh, Allie.

11:15.102 --> 11:17.174
You guys were right before about Bea.

11:17.180 --> 11:20.138
Oh no, love, look I think we
all got a little bit worked up.

11:20.144 --> 11:21.344
- (Liz sighs)
- (hushed) Here.

11:23.753 --> 11:25.573
You should have this, not me.

11:27.763 --> 11:29.676
I'm shit at being her widow.

11:29.888 --> 11:31.088
(chuckles disbelievingly)

11:31.094 --> 11:34.903
- Allie, this is... this is yours.
- I don't deserve it.

11:36.278 --> 11:39.582
- (hushed) I didn't deserve her.
- No, no, no, hey, hey...

11:39.786 --> 11:42.089
Lovey, that is not true.

11:42.095 --> 11:43.996
Liz, please keep this safe.

11:45.098 --> 11:46.489
No matter what.

11:48.285 --> 11:49.671
Allie...

11:51.322 --> 11:52.589
(echoing drum beat)

11:52.595 --> 11:55.595
(tense music)

12:11.310 --> 12:14.617
(magpie cawing)

12:14.623 --> 12:16.321
(wind whistling)

12:16.737 --> 12:19.737
(music brightens with a drum beat)

12:23.763 --> 12:25.966
- (magpie cawing and music ends)
- Hey.

12:25.972 --> 12:27.340
- Hey there.
- Hey.

12:27.951 --> 12:30.263
Jesus Christ, it's a
bloody barrel of laughs

12:30.269 --> 12:31.504
- out here, ain't it?
- I know, yeah.

12:31.510 --> 12:32.710
Look at that.

12:32.716 --> 12:35.073
LIZ: I can't believe the
boys are siding with Ferguson

12:35.079 --> 12:36.293
after what she did.

12:36.299 --> 12:38.814
Doesn't look like they've
got much choice to me.

12:38.820 --> 12:41.975
Probably scared to death,
like the rest of us.

12:41.981 --> 12:44.344
Oh, well boo-fuckin'-hoo.

12:44.401 --> 12:47.997
Nah, if Kaz had let me bash Lucy
none of this would've happened, eh?

12:48.003 --> 12:51.020
Ooh, now, Susan, violence
isn't the answer to everything.

12:51.026 --> 12:53.911
Yeah, that's what people
who can't fight always say.

12:54.215 --> 12:55.415
Always.

12:55.486 --> 12:57.515
- SONIA: Always?
- BOOMER: (chuckling) Always.

13:00.665 --> 13:02.268
- D.
- Eh.

13:05.360 --> 13:08.688
Ferguson's got everyone
walkin' on eggshells.

13:09.715 --> 13:12.757
- Can you do somethin' for me?
- Oh, I'm not takin' on Ferguson.

13:13.236 --> 13:14.731
Were you thinkin' about it?

13:14.737 --> 13:16.721
Nah, everyone else is.

13:17.333 --> 13:19.426
You know we'd be right
behind you if you did.

13:19.432 --> 13:20.745
What'd you wanna ask me?

13:21.258 --> 13:23.192
Can you have a chat to Allie?

13:23.198 --> 13:24.456
About what?

13:24.462 --> 13:26.955
We tried an intervention and
it didn't go down very well.

13:26.961 --> 13:28.559
Oh, well there's a surprise.

13:28.719 --> 13:29.951
I'm worried about her.

13:29.957 --> 13:32.227
I'm worried she's gonna OD
or top herself or something.

13:32.233 --> 13:33.433
What?

13:33.439 --> 13:35.532
She gave me Bea's sketchbook.

13:35.538 --> 13:37.217
- Yeah?
- It's the last thing in the world

13:37.223 --> 13:39.040
- she'd wanna give away.
- Ah.

13:39.046 --> 13:42.164
She sounded like she was
goin' away and not comin' back.

13:42.536 --> 13:44.434
Oh shit, Liz, I'm not
a grieve councillor.

13:44.440 --> 13:46.419
I know, love, I know, but...

13:46.425 --> 13:47.670
just have a word to her and

13:47.676 --> 13:49.770
make sure she's not
gonna do anything stupid.

13:49.776 --> 13:51.079
Yeah, sure.

13:51.085 --> 13:52.857
You know junkies,
they'll tell you anything.

13:52.863 --> 13:54.482
Yeah. Thanks, love.

13:59.971 --> 14:02.971
(jaunty music with drums)

14:04.328 --> 14:05.528
(music ends)

14:11.033 --> 14:12.233
Oi.

14:12.776 --> 14:13.976
You got a minute?

14:14.850 --> 14:16.050
Sure.

14:16.521 --> 14:19.257
Liz is freakin' out. She's
seriously worried about ya.

14:19.263 --> 14:21.355
(sighs) Oh, well she shouldn't be.

14:22.240 --> 14:24.764
She reckons you're tryin'
to score drugs off Ferguson.

14:25.130 --> 14:26.330
(scoffs)

14:28.132 --> 14:29.553
I'm not.

14:30.052 --> 14:32.323
Where's the stash... hmm?

14:32.402 --> 14:33.809
Is it here somewhere?

14:33.972 --> 14:36.292
- Ah-huh. In here?
- What the fuck are you doing, Franky?!

14:37.089 --> 14:41.421
- Look out. Don't... Fuck off!
- Don't Franky! Fuck! Get off!

14:41.722 --> 14:42.922
(sighs)

14:42.928 --> 14:44.128
Give it back.

14:44.448 --> 14:46.455
You've got enough fuckin' shit here

14:46.461 --> 14:48.511
- to kill a horse!
- Give it back.

14:48.729 --> 14:50.934
- Give it to me! Please!
- Back off or I'll flush it!

14:50.940 --> 14:52.200
- No, please, please don't.
- I'm gonna flush it.

14:52.206 --> 14:53.747
Please, you don't understand. I need it!

14:53.753 --> 14:55.632
- Poor Red.
- I really need... Oh, fuck you, Franky!

14:55.638 --> 14:57.616
You don't know anything about
us. You weren't even here!

14:57.622 --> 15:00.948
I know she didn't die so you could
become a fuckin' junkie again!

15:01.150 --> 15:02.350
(quietly tense music)

15:02.356 --> 15:04.234
- GUARD: Come on, get a move on.
- (sighs exasperatedly) Okay...

15:04.240 --> 15:05.515
- (hushed) Okay.
- You're gonna be late for your meeting

15:05.521 --> 15:06.721
with the doc.

15:09.260 --> 15:10.460
I'm clean.

15:10.846 --> 15:14.151
- I have been since Bea. I am!
- Bullshit!

15:14.338 --> 15:15.538
(sighs)

15:15.544 --> 15:17.077
I've been stockpiling.

15:17.580 --> 15:19.629
I just need one more hit and I'm ready.

15:19.635 --> 15:20.835
For what?!

15:20.841 --> 15:22.041
Ferguson.

15:22.047 --> 15:24.047
I'm gonna hotshot the bitch.

15:24.563 --> 15:25.775
Fuck no!

15:25.781 --> 15:29.146
Don't go down the same rabbit hole
as Red did. Look where that got her.

15:29.152 --> 15:30.467
I'm willing to take that risk.

15:30.473 --> 15:32.130
What and you think Ferguson's
just gonna stand there

15:32.136 --> 15:33.574
while you stick her with a needle?

15:35.178 --> 15:36.871
I'll find a way.

15:37.183 --> 15:39.093
Forget it!

15:40.164 --> 15:42.013
Now, you flush it!

15:44.867 --> 15:47.273
Ferguson is a fuckin' spider.

15:47.279 --> 15:49.343
She's got eyes in the back of her head.

15:49.349 --> 15:52.124
Now, you flush the shit or I will.

15:59.197 --> 16:00.517
(hushed) Fine.

16:00.815 --> 16:02.037
(door unlocking outside)

16:02.043 --> 16:03.539
- (toilet flushing)
- (music ends)

16:06.101 --> 16:07.484
You were never gonna get that close

16:07.490 --> 16:08.690
- to her.
- (sighs)

16:09.796 --> 16:11.234
(Franky sighs deeply)

16:14.511 --> 16:17.511
(music restarts)

16:19.042 --> 16:21.770
(echoing drum beat flourish)

16:24.373 --> 16:25.573
(music fading)

16:25.579 --> 16:28.087
- (echoing drum beat flourish)
- (grating whooshing flourish)

16:30.407 --> 16:31.607
What do you want?

16:34.520 --> 16:36.123
I need more of everything.

16:36.129 --> 16:37.329
Already?

16:37.471 --> 16:40.311
What, you think I sit on my
arse all day like all you bosses?

16:40.317 --> 16:42.816
You'll have to wait.
Bin delivery's next week.

16:42.822 --> 16:45.722
Next week? I have customers.

16:45.728 --> 16:49.740
- You organise an extra delivery.
- Yeah, and wave a big red flag.

16:49.746 --> 16:52.779
Or maybe I need a
supplier with bigger balls.

16:52.785 --> 16:55.344
Or maybe you need a week
in the slot to chill out.

16:55.756 --> 16:57.543
Let's make money...

16:57.881 --> 17:00.215
not war. Okay?

17:00.781 --> 17:03.189
- (throbbing music)
- I have an idea.

17:09.364 --> 17:10.753
Yeah, Turk, it's me.

17:10.828 --> 17:13.561
I need another bin drop. Urgent.

17:14.551 --> 17:15.752
Cheers.

17:16.747 --> 17:18.700
SONIA: This has the potential

17:18.705 --> 17:21.857
to put Wentworth at the
forefront of vocational training

17:21.863 --> 17:24.868
- in the prison system.
- Stevens, I admire your enthusiasm,

17:24.875 --> 17:26.955
but I don't think we have the resources

17:26.962 --> 17:28.550
- to expand this project.
- Well, money's not a problem.

17:28.556 --> 17:31.057
I have already lined up a
very generous benefactor.

17:31.063 --> 17:34.411
And why are they interested
in funding such an enterprise?

17:34.417 --> 17:35.723
Pure philanthropy,

17:35.729 --> 17:39.802
because this project has the potential
to capture the hearts and minds

17:39.808 --> 17:43.708
of the women. To give them a truly
meaningful purpose in their lives.

17:44.091 --> 17:46.239
Is Ferguson behind this?

17:46.785 --> 17:48.181
Certainly not,

17:48.394 --> 17:50.716
and I'm not seeking her approval.

17:51.035 --> 17:52.343
Only yours.

17:52.349 --> 17:55.129
(inhales deeply) Well, in principle
I think it's an excellent idea,

17:55.135 --> 17:57.325
but I will need the approval
of the Regional Manager

17:57.331 --> 17:59.899
if we want to expand it into
a fully fledged industry.

17:59.905 --> 18:01.615
- Can't wait to tell the other women.
- (siren waling)

18:01.621 --> 18:03.237
MILES: (via walkie-talkie)
Attention, officers. We have a Code Red

18:03.243 --> 18:06.175
in the H Block exercise
yard. I'll repeat. Code Red.

18:06.181 --> 18:08.727
- H Block exercise yard. Request backup.
- (tense music)

18:09.316 --> 18:13.791
- (siren continues waling and chirping)
- (fire roaring)

18:14.844 --> 18:16.788
(fire extinguishers whooshing)

18:25.140 --> 18:27.570
Organise some prisoners
to clean this up.

18:27.576 --> 18:28.776
(siren stops)

18:31.062 --> 18:32.758
What'll they think of next?

18:33.732 --> 18:34.932
(music fades)

18:34.938 --> 18:37.366
This is not a random act of vandalism.

18:37.372 --> 18:39.210
We couldn't identify them from the CCTV.

18:39.216 --> 18:41.349
They had their hoodies pulled
up and their faces covered.

18:41.355 --> 18:43.146
What about if that's how they
were getting the drugs in?

18:43.152 --> 18:44.443
Sanitary Bins?

18:44.449 --> 18:47.503
Well, I've checked all the other
supplies, nothing jumped out.

18:47.509 --> 18:51.025
What if they torched the bins so we'd
have to order urgent replacements?

18:51.806 --> 18:53.298
Yeah, I s'pose it's possible.

18:53.304 --> 18:54.704
Let's test my theory.

18:56.595 --> 18:57.932
(echoing drum beat flourish)

18:59.195 --> 19:00.529
(whooshing flourish)

19:04.016 --> 19:05.216
(hushed) Fuck!

19:12.440 --> 19:13.640
(exhales)

19:21.248 --> 19:23.212
(plastic rustling)

19:23.218 --> 19:25.612
(urgent music)

19:25.618 --> 19:26.935
(gasps quietly)

19:27.362 --> 19:29.326
(laughing)

19:29.522 --> 19:32.413
(warping flourish)

19:32.419 --> 19:33.719
(flood lights flick off echoing)

19:33.725 --> 19:36.018
(whooshing flourish)

19:36.789 --> 19:39.789
(percussive accents in music)

19:40.259 --> 19:41.971
(cell door clanging open)

19:43.161 --> 19:44.799
_

19:48.274 --> 19:49.474
(lift dings)

19:51.574 --> 19:54.271
Sierra 6 to Sierra 3, they're
coming out of the lift now.

19:54.277 --> 19:55.695
Copy that Sierra 6.

19:59.195 --> 20:01.359
- _
- (urgent music continue)

20:02.288 --> 20:04.687
We've spoken about it before,
I don't want to talk about it.

20:04.693 --> 20:05.946
So, that's...

20:10.304 --> 20:11.504
Okay?

20:13.036 --> 20:14.347
I gotta go.

20:20.669 --> 20:21.869
(door closing)

20:28.187 --> 20:30.133
(suspenseful tone and drum beat)

20:30.139 --> 20:31.783
- (door opening)
- Tina!

20:31.789 --> 20:33.422
- Okay, Mercado, that'll do!
- (hushed) Fuck!

20:34.397 --> 20:35.697
- Back up, Mercado.
- (music ends)

20:35.703 --> 20:37.907
- (suspenseful tone continues)
- WILL: Take that...

20:39.360 --> 20:40.560
and the shiv.

20:46.832 --> 20:48.965
On your rags, Mr Jackson?

21:00.776 --> 21:03.050
- Where is it?
- I don't know what the fuck

21:03.056 --> 21:05.190
- you're talking about.
- Where's the fucking gear?!

21:05.241 --> 21:07.843
(drum beating flourish)

21:09.249 --> 21:12.918
- This is gonna be awesome!
- We are the ideal team, you and I.

21:12.924 --> 21:15.816
- Yeah, Dream Team.
- Because we have absolutely nothing in

21:15.822 --> 21:17.635
- common. We couldn't be more different.
- Huh.

21:17.641 --> 21:21.018
But like all good partners,
we compliment each other.

21:21.024 --> 21:24.447
Yeah... yeah, like...
like, I like your hair.

21:24.453 --> 21:28.048
- Uh, I do. Yeah. Yeah, see.
- I like your enthusiasm!

21:28.054 --> 21:30.845
Hey. Hey. We're goin' into business!

21:30.851 --> 21:32.218
- Eh!
- Oh!

21:32.224 --> 21:33.819
- You got the green light.
- Well, the Governor's on-board.

21:33.825 --> 21:36.410
We just need the approval
of the powers that be.

21:36.416 --> 21:39.045
- Whoo! That's awesome.
- LIZ: That is great news, Booms.

21:39.051 --> 21:40.496
Yeah, we're gonna take over the world.

21:40.502 --> 21:42.228
And, as a matter of fact, we've got, uh,

21:42.234 --> 21:43.799
a proposition to make to you, Liz,

21:43.805 --> 21:45.611
- haven't we? Mmm.
- Yes. Yes.

21:45.617 --> 21:49.613
We want you to come on-board
as our Horticultural Expert.

21:49.619 --> 21:50.819
We need a green thumb.

21:50.825 --> 21:52.641
Oh, I don't know, I don't know...

21:52.647 --> 21:55.438
Come on, do it. Get amongst
it. Get your hands dirty.

21:56.844 --> 21:58.165
VERA: Anderson...

21:58.736 --> 22:00.654
- can I have a word please?
- Yes, Governor.

22:04.624 --> 22:05.824
BOOMER: Oh.

22:06.434 --> 22:08.061
What do ya reckon that is?

22:08.067 --> 22:10.536
Oh, it's probably her
transfer knock-back.

22:10.542 --> 22:12.728
Official paperwork's probably arrived.

22:12.734 --> 22:14.959

22:15.713 --> 22:18.217

22:18.223 --> 22:19.931
Are you all right, lovey?

22:20.019 --> 22:22.228

Attention, compound.

22:42.608 --> 22:44.807
- Phones are now available for use.

22:44.813 --> 22:46.712

Nash. You know what to do.

22:46.850 --> 22:48.050
(beep)

22:48.056 --> 22:50.970
Hi, Nash, it's me.
Uh, I've got some news.

22:50.976 --> 22:52.985
Oh, some good news.

22:53.048 --> 22:54.875
(laughing) I made parole,

22:55.040 --> 22:57.236
and, oh, it's a bit of a shock but...

22:57.666 --> 22:59.902
they're releasing me
tomorrow, and, uh...

22:59.908 --> 23:03.974
Look, I really, really need

Wh... what would you care?

23:15.894 --> 23:17.094
(tone abating)

23:17.100 --> 23:18.663
Is that so hard to believe?

23:18.669 --> 23:19.868
(hushed) Yeah.

23:20.379 --> 23:22.729
(ominous music)

23:23.090 --> 23:24.290
I... I've, um...

23:24.296 --> 23:25.729
I felt we had a special bond...

23:25.735 --> 23:28.106
- That's bull shit! I just remind you
- especially after the job supporting...

23:28.112 --> 23:31.038
- of someone else.
- No, no, no, that's not true.

23:32.925 --> 23:34.125
It's not true.

23:34.510 --> 23:35.710
It's not true.

23:37.013 --> 23:38.213
(music abates)

23:38.219 --> 23:40.759

ever come near me again.

23:56.861 --> 23:58.061
Doyle...

23:58.564 --> 24:00.394

24:00.400 --> 24:01.600
(exhales)

24:01.606 --> 24:03.378
This'll never be home, Mr J.

24:03.486 --> 24:04.686
Fair enough.

(indistinct background chatter)

- _

24:19.809 --> 24:22.088
- How'd you go?
- Empty.

24:22.094 --> 24:24.104
Some arsehole tipped them off.

24:24.300 --> 24:26.902
- Maybe you were wrong about the bins?
- No, there's no chance.

24:26.908 --> 24:29.113
Mercado was there waiting
to pick up the delivery.

24:29.690 --> 24:32.009
So, you caught her
red-handed. Did you slot her?

24:32.015 --> 24:34.265
Only for having a shiv.
Now she won't talk.

24:34.401 --> 24:36.292
Well, at least you
know one thing for sure.

24:36.298 --> 24:37.498
What's that?

24:37.504 --> 24:39.585
There is definitely a dodgy officer.

- (cell door creaking and banging)

24:52.567 --> 24:54.979
What the fuck just happened?

24:55.139 --> 24:57.347
I just saved your arse
is what just happened.

24:57.353 --> 24:59.032
You let us walk into a shitstorm.

24:59.038 --> 25:01.014
Who do you think
called off the delivery?

25:01.214 --> 25:02.794
What? You could have told me.

25:02.800 --> 25:04.114
There wasn't time.

25:04.120 --> 25:07.115
I heard about the raid and had just
enough time to call the supplier.

25:08.686 --> 25:12.131
So now we are fucked again.

25:13.620 --> 25:15.214
We'll just have to find another way.

25:16.423 --> 25:18.025
(flood lights flicking on)

25:18.031 --> 25:21.292
- Do you reckon we should get Allie? Ah.
- Nah, don't reckon she's up for it.

25:21.298 --> 25:22.915
- Did you have a chance to talk to her?
- Yeah, she's good.

25:22.921 --> 25:25.225
- She's not gonna do anything stupid.
- Oh, thanks, love.

25:25.231 --> 25:27.139
- That's all right. Good on ya.
- Come on you two.

25:27.231 --> 25:28.431

25:39.735 --> 25:40.891
What?

25:41.100 --> 25:42.291

25:43.692 --> 25:47.205

25:47.211 --> 25:50.285
In your own house, with Nash and Joshy.

25:50.291 --> 25:51.785
You and Nashy, like, goin' at it,

25:51.791 --> 25:52.991

- LIZ: Oh.

25:53.387 --> 25:55.192
- LIZ: Okay, girls. Okay.
- (laughing loudly)

25:57.197 --> 25:59.291
All right, girls.
Okay, come on. Come on.

25:59.297 --> 26:02.668
Now, listen... we're gonna have to
make a toast and I volunteer Franky.

26:02.674 --> 26:04.184
- Oh!
- LIZ: You make the toast.

26:04.377 --> 26:05.681
Why, is someone leavin'?

bearable with you in it.

26:22.599 --> 26:24.864
But we're gonna forgive
you for leavin' us...

26:25.251 --> 26:28.032
because you belong on the
outside with your other family.

Now, we're gonna miss ya heaps,

26:32.650 --> 26:35.861
but we will never forgive you

26:35.867 --> 26:37.470

What, not at all?

27:29.509 --> 27:31.705
I keep gettin' his voice-mail.

27:31.954 --> 27:34.863
Well, you try again in the
morning. You'll get hold of him.

27:34.869 --> 27:36.584
I don't even know if
he's gotten the message.

27:36.590 --> 27:39.009
I mean, we haven't even had
a chance to make any plans.

Oh, I thought she was booked
in for tomorrow. Sorry.

35:10.689 --> 35:12.407
Hey... Ms Westfall.

35:12.413 --> 35:14.496
Did I stuff up? I thought we said 3:00.

35:14.502 --> 35:15.707
Sorry I'm late.

35:15.713 --> 35:18.011
Oh no, it's no drama. It's
not like I'm goin' anywhere.

35:22.661 --> 35:24.562
So, what have you stolen this time?

35:24.744 --> 35:26.608
What, you want to check my pockets?

35:26.614 --> 35:29.142
What I want is to stop
having to cover for you.

35:30.422 --> 35:31.807
- What are you doing here?
- (train horn sounds in distance)

35:31.813 --> 35:33.214
Came to see you.

35:40.118 --> 35:42.960
You know you promised me.
You looked me in the eye...

35:43.048 --> 35:46.048
and you promised me. You said, "I'm
not going to try anything anymore."

35:46.251 --> 35:47.451
Yeah, I know.

35:47.457 --> 35:49.840
And I believed you, again!

35:50.888 --> 35:53.112
I'm not doing this anymore, Franky.

35:54.092 --> 35:56.002
Look, I'm doin' it for us.

35:59.873 --> 36:01.166
I won't do it again.

36:01.172 --> 36:02.372
Get out!

36:02.570 --> 36:04.270
- I'm sorry.
- Now!

36:08.585 --> 36:09.785
(door opens)

36:10.689 --> 36:11.889
(door closes)

36:16.205 --> 36:19.205
(ominous music)

36:25.259 --> 36:27.395
(inhales) Got enough money now.

36:27.984 --> 36:29.578
So you have.

36:30.682 --> 36:33.233
"Law of supply and demand", you said.

36:33.896 --> 36:35.223
(inhales)

36:37.601 --> 36:39.616
There's your fuckload of cash.

36:43.536 --> 36:44.854
Where's my gear?

36:45.359 --> 36:46.559
(Allie scoffs)

36:46.565 --> 36:48.370
That's ten times the going rate!

36:48.376 --> 36:50.240
- FERGUSON: Ah...
- Tell her to give me my fucking gear!

36:50.246 --> 36:52.061
Now, you've been holding out on me.

36:52.843 --> 36:54.738
- (scoffs)
- You've got something far more valuable

36:54.744 --> 36:57.446
to trade than someone else's money.

36:58.197 --> 37:00.591
- Where did you get that?!
- Ah-ah-ah... eh.

37:00.597 --> 37:03.785
You said that I could have anything
from your cell that I wanted.

37:04.348 --> 37:05.548
Not that.

37:05.824 --> 37:08.098
Warned you the price would be high.

37:09.934 --> 37:11.134
Hmm.

37:13.672 --> 37:15.798
(drum beats flourish)

37:18.591 --> 37:21.144
- No, please...
- (drum beats flourish)

37:21.442 --> 37:22.642
don't burn it.

37:22.648 --> 37:24.945
(inhales) No, no, no, I won't.

37:25.654 --> 37:27.765
You will. Come on.

37:32.070 --> 37:33.986
(fan whirs)

37:35.886 --> 37:37.886
You want the drugs, don't you?

37:39.389 --> 37:41.284
Then you will burn it.

37:41.874 --> 37:44.550
Page by page.

37:51.613 --> 37:52.813
Let's go.

37:57.483 --> 37:59.079
(inhales) Wait!

38:03.981 --> 38:05.269
(inhales deeply)

38:07.712 --> 38:09.531
(drum beats flourish)

38:09.537 --> 38:10.828
(sighs)

38:15.030 --> 38:16.925
(drum beats flourish)

38:18.804 --> 38:20.093
(inhales)

38:20.099 --> 38:21.299
(page rips)

38:22.294 --> 38:24.092
(drum beats flourish)

38:25.991 --> 38:27.191
(sniffles)

38:29.479 --> 38:31.461
(drum beats flourish)

38:32.650 --> 38:33.850
(whimpers quietly)

38:37.866 --> 38:39.200
(drum beat flourish)

38:40.998 --> 38:42.198
(sniffles)

38:42.408 --> 38:44.141
(twanging guitar flourish)

38:48.399 --> 38:53.406
- (echoing muted screams)
- (music ends)

38:53.744 --> 38:55.906
(crying)

38:58.075 --> 38:59.275
(hushed) Oh...

39:00.478 --> 39:01.708
fuck!

39:02.581 --> 39:03.967
Oh, fuck!

39:04.586 --> 39:06.951
Oh, no! No, no, no!

39:06.957 --> 39:08.566
Oh, shit!

39:08.773 --> 39:09.973
(crying)

39:10.167 --> 39:11.367
(sighing)

39:11.885 --> 39:15.529
(breathing heavily)

39:15.535 --> 39:16.735
(laughs)

39:19.325 --> 39:21.422
(crying)

39:22.492 --> 39:24.822
- (sighs deeply)
- (urgent music intensifies)

39:27.806 --> 39:29.673
(muffled and echoing sounds)

39:31.264 --> 39:38.522
(slowly whooshing flourish)

39:38.568 --> 39:39.862
(warping flourish)

39:45.024 --> 39:46.224
(music ends)

39:46.295 --> 39:48.111
- (drips echoing)
- INMATE: Looks.

39:48.912 --> 39:50.979
(Lights flick on automatically)

39:52.955 --> 39:55.260
- (shower curtains rustling)
- (heart beat flourish)

39:55.266 --> 39:57.466
Out, bitch, it's Ferguson's time!

39:57.949 --> 39:59.444
- (Allie groans quietly)
- Come on, get out!

39:59.450 --> 40:02.063
Leave her, she's nothing to worry about.

40:04.610 --> 40:07.610
(uneasy undertone intensifies)

40:15.069 --> 40:17.159
(laboured breathing)

40:18.614 --> 40:20.027
Look at you.

40:21.689 --> 40:24.689
(undertone becomes ominous)

40:28.809 --> 40:33.535
- (breathing shallowly)
- (drum beats added to music)

40:33.894 --> 40:35.313
Worthless.

40:36.537 --> 40:37.737
(moans quietly)

40:39.545 --> 40:40.945
Nothing.

40:44.356 --> 40:46.753
- (weakly) Help.
- Look how far you'll go to escape

40:46.759 --> 40:48.967
- your pathetic existence.
- (groans quietly)

40:54.141 --> 40:55.341
FERGUSON: Oh...

40:57.018 --> 40:58.826
do you want to touch me?

40:58.832 --> 41:00.032
(groans quietly)

41:03.326 --> 41:04.526
Do you?

41:06.731 --> 41:08.834
- (quietly whooshing flourish)
- (groans quietly)

41:08.840 --> 41:10.632
- But you're filthy.
- (tap creaks on)

41:11.139 --> 41:13.326
(gasping and crying)

41:13.332 --> 41:15.734
You're a filthy whore.

41:16.041 --> 41:18.268
A little Top Dog whore.

41:18.346 --> 41:20.051
(crying quietly)

41:21.160 --> 41:23.184
- (gasps)
- You're just drawn to strong women,

41:23.190 --> 41:24.871
- aren't you?
- (gasping quietly)

41:25.362 --> 41:29.080
First Kaz and... then Bea, and now me.

41:29.293 --> 41:31.012
Come on, get clean, huh?

41:31.115 --> 41:32.315
(splutters)

41:32.321 --> 41:34.805
(hushed) You like to fly in our orbit,

41:34.929 --> 41:37.728
- even if you burn your wings.
- (gasping)

41:38.522 --> 41:40.730
(hushed) Little star-fucker!

41:41.913 --> 41:43.113
(Allie exhales)

41:43.119 --> 41:45.988
If only Bea could see us now.

41:46.593 --> 41:50.514
(sighs slowly)

41:51.085 --> 41:54.421
FERGUSON: (gasps) Arrrgh! Arrrgh!

41:54.588 --> 41:56.603
- (Allie gasps and pants)
- (music pulsating)

41:57.506 --> 41:58.706
Ah-huh.

42:00.070 --> 42:01.270
Ugh!

42:01.276 --> 42:02.981
(panting heavily)

42:02.987 --> 42:04.273
(Allie breathing heavily)

42:04.279 --> 42:05.671
Ah! (whimpers)

42:05.815 --> 42:07.015
(gasps)

42:07.021 --> 42:10.036
- (thud)
- (echoing drum beat flourish)

42:10.120 --> 42:11.320
(groans)

42:11.326 --> 42:12.526
ALLIE: Do it!

42:13.430 --> 42:16.443
- Please!
- (breathing heavily)

42:16.449 --> 42:18.990
- Do it!
- You'd like that wouldn't you?

42:18.996 --> 42:21.505
- So you can be with your Queen Bea.
- (crying)

42:21.511 --> 42:23.807
- (breathing heavily)
- (crying) Do it!

42:24.531 --> 42:26.316
Please!

42:26.322 --> 42:28.522
- (breathing heavily)
- (crying)

42:28.655 --> 42:29.950
No.

42:29.956 --> 42:34.038
- (breathing heavily)
- (crying)

42:34.044 --> 42:36.443
There's no easy way out for you.

42:36.616 --> 42:37.940
Ah, help!

42:38.211 --> 42:39.637
(coughing)

42:40.907 --> 42:43.915
(coughing and gasping)

42:44.526 --> 42:45.726
(coughs)

42:46.236 --> 42:48.273
(gasping)

42:48.279 --> 42:51.522
When Bea came to kill
me, I overpowered her too.

42:51.633 --> 42:52.881
(hushed) Hell no.

42:52.887 --> 42:54.779
She threw herself on her own shiv.

42:54.785 --> 42:57.784
She sacrificed herself
so she could be with you.

42:58.459 --> 43:01.652
(laughing mockingly)

43:01.658 --> 43:03.980
But here you are, huh?

43:04.670 --> 43:06.167
(spluttering and coughing)

43:06.799 --> 43:09.335
- The love of your life just...
- (crying and coughing)

43:09.899 --> 43:11.099
(gasps)

43:11.105 --> 43:13.326
- (hushed) died for nothing.
- (crying)

43:13.410 --> 43:17.512
- (gasping and panting)
- (shower curtain rustles)

43:17.518 --> 43:18.718
(exhales)

43:19.509 --> 43:20.709
(inhales deeply)

43:21.306 --> 43:24.306
(forlorn music)

43:28.898 --> 43:30.827
(echoing and muffled thud)

43:40.988 --> 43:42.674
(whooshing flourish)

43:42.680 --> 43:45.680
(crying)

43:56.143 --> 43:58.445
(sobbing) Oh, I'm sorry.

43:58.740 --> 44:00.563
(sobbing)

44:01.845 --> 44:04.059
(hushed) So sorry.

44:04.376 --> 44:06.778
(sobbing)

44:07.091 --> 44:08.894
What the hell happened to you?

44:08.900 --> 44:12.253
(sobbing) I was so close.

44:13.066 --> 44:17.995
I had the needle in her
neck but I stuffed it up.

44:18.600 --> 44:20.808
How are you still alive?

44:20.814 --> 44:22.416
(sobbing)

44:22.422 --> 44:23.622
Come here.

44:23.628 --> 44:25.111
- She could've killed me
- Shhh.

44:25.117 --> 44:27.230
but she wouldn't do it.

44:27.855 --> 44:31.065
- I wish she had.
- Shhh. No you don't.

44:31.251 --> 44:33.329
(crying)

44:33.335 --> 44:36.759
She said Bea died for nothing.

44:36.765 --> 44:39.133
- (sobbing)
- Shhh.

44:40.716 --> 44:43.373
(sobbing) I wanna die.

44:43.379 --> 44:44.786
(gentle music)

44:44.792 --> 44:47.308
- (sobbing)
- (sighs)

44:50.588 --> 44:53.225
I got up on the roof
today, to check it out.

44:54.292 --> 44:56.617
I felt the breeze on my face.

44:57.782 --> 45:00.507
I could see over the
walls, to the horizon.

45:01.933 --> 45:05.318
There was only one locked door
between me and the outside.

45:07.627 --> 45:09.335
Now, I'm gonna get out...

45:09.426 --> 45:12.020
and I'm gonna find out
who killed Pennisi...

45:15.901 --> 45:17.599
and you're gonna come with me.

45:18.198 --> 45:19.506
What?

45:19.512 --> 45:21.687
Fuck this dying shit!

45:21.882 --> 45:24.903
Now, you need to get out
and you need to live a happy life.

45:24.909 --> 45:27.273
That's the revenge you get on Ferguson.

45:28.386 --> 45:30.316
Oh, you're serious.

45:36.396 --> 45:37.913
- You're on.
- Hmm.

45:38.424 --> 45:39.624
(echoing thud)

45:42.428 --> 45:43.628
(music ends)
