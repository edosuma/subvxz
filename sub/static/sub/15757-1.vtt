Open the cash register.

03:07.021 --> 03:08.900
Shut up, open the fucking box.

03:11.872 --> 03:12.872
Shut up.

03:13.869 --> 03:15.979
Hey you. Come here.

Your wallet. Throw it to the floor.

03:27.214 --> 03:30.266
- Come on!
- Come, come!

03:35.851 --> 03:37.988
Put it in a bag whore.

03:38.604 --> 03:42.048

- Plastic.

03:44.487 --> 03:46.659
Hey, come back here.

03:46.760 --> 03:51.415
Look, lady, I do not care
shit, I do, okay?

03:51.415 --> 03:54.332
Do what you have
to do, just let me out of it.

03:54.333 --> 03:56.054
What?

03:56.951 --> 03:58.604
You think I'm a lady?

03:59.402 --> 04:03.097
- Are not you?
- Do not you think that'll shoot you in the face?

04:03.298 --> 04:04.812
I hope not.

04:08.121 --> 04:09.846
Drop it.

04:09.847 --> 04:12.566
- What?
- That shit that you bring, let her go.

04:12.989 --> 04:15.184
It is the last bottle, I need it.

04:15.185 --> 04:17.079
Drop it.

04:18.396 --> 04:21.648
- I have a bleeding foot.
- I have a fucking gun.

04:25.095 --> 04:26.692
Who will pay for that?

04:31.989 --> 04:33.497
Give me my wallet.

04:45.154 --> 04:46.846

Drop the gun!

05:01.058 --> 05:02.999
- Drop it now!
- Okay.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.437
Want to fuck me?

05:05.902 --> 05:08.088
Out of my store!
Out!

05:14.400 --> 05:16.926
- Get off my car!
- What Car?

05:16.927 --> 05:18.560
You are seated.

05:18.561 --> 05:20.420
I was in toilet.

Subtitles: Daztanar!

06:55.030 --> 06:56.311
Hello?

06:56.312 --> 06:59.004
Hello, sorry to bother you.

06:59.005 --> 07:01.119
I am new to Los Angeles y. ..

07:01.119 --> 07:04.649
going to meet a friend
with whom I stay ...

07:04.649 --> 07:11.583
I have just been assaulted and took my
phone, wallet, and I was wounded.

07:11.984 --> 07:17.223
Lord I saw the sign in its window and
I wondered if I could pass y. ..

07:17.224 --> 07:23.211
use your phone and get ready.
I know how it should sound.

07:23.709 --> 07:25.568
Still the Lord then?

07:25.569 --> 07:30.786
Yes, imagine how relieved I felt
when I saw the sign in its window.

07:30.787 --> 07:33.478
But do not use the cross.

07:33.479 --> 07:38.307
No, unfortunately I was
torn during the robbery.

07:39.059 --> 07:41.357
Maybe you have another next Christmas.

07:43.632 --> 07:45.454
I do not understand, I am a Christian.

07:45.455 --> 07:49.295
Maybe, but certainly not follow
Jehovah.

07:49.296 --> 07:53.263
We do not celebrate Christmas and
not recognize the cross, wolf.

08:23.926 --> 08:26.096
<i>Dear  Warwick, I'm in
Sidney and I love sunny ...</ i></i>

08:27.670 --> 08:29.118
<i> love Julia. </ i></i>

09:07.577 --> 09:08.711
Yes?

09:09.423 --> 09:11.092
Yeah, you Warwick?

09:11.313 --> 09:13.165
Warwick, yes.
Who is it?

09:13.166 --> 09:16.773
Hi Warwick, I am John,
friend Julia.

09:16.774 --> 09:18.632
She's not here now.

09:19.033 --> 09:21.958
Yes, I know, I just leave it in Sydney.

09:23.118 --> 09:24.436
Really?

09:26.240 --> 09:28.022
What I can do for you?

09:29.353 --> 09:31.268
Well, I'm in a mess.

09:31.269 --> 09:35.992
I just arrived in the country, and
airport lost my luggage

09:35.993 --> 09:38.224
and above all I was assaulted.

09:38.398 --> 09:39.937
Oh, my God.

09:40.378 --> 09:45.265
If planning to stay with
my cousin and now there's nobody home.

09:46.054 --> 09:47.299
If ...

09:47.800 --> 09:50.826
Look, would not normally do
something, but ...

09:51.668 --> 09:55.300
... Julia not stop talking
on the great person you are,

09:55.677 --> 09:59.372
was going to call anyway
I thought ...

10:04.518 --> 10:09.212
I thought maybe I could go
and fix the issues.

10:09.213 --> 10:11.303
You are my last resort.

10:12.809 --> 10:18.316
I ... I love to help but ...
I expect people to dinner.

10:19.164 --> 10:22.640
I'd be doing a
great favor.

10:23.472 --> 10:24.903
Sorry.

10:24.904 --> 10:28.300
Okay, no hard feelings.
Maybe another time.

10:41.592 --> 10:43.621
- John?
- Yes.

10:44.610 --> 10:48.986
Sorry, I do not forgive Julia,
Sure you can spend.

10:48.987 --> 10:52.455
- You must be exhausted. I'm Warwick.
- John.

10:59.287 --> 11:02.559
Can I get you something to drink?
Â¿Mineral water, wine?

11:03.273 --> 11:05.283
Yes, wine.

11:06.294 --> 11:08.380
- Red or white?
- Red.

11:09.066 --> 11:10.181
Thank you.

11:42.006 --> 11:43.248
Here you go.

11:44.440 --> 11:45.578
Thank you.

11:46.085 --> 11:48.273
- Linda home.
- Thanks.

11:49.048 --> 11:50.577
Please take a seat.

11:50.616 --> 11:51.978
Okay, thanks.

11:56.727 --> 11:59.994
- And how was Australia.
- Oh, great.

12:01.961 --> 12:06.642
Beautiful, the beaches are amazing,
I wish I could have stayed longer.

12:07.376 --> 12:10.238
Travel. One of the real
pleasures of life.

12:13.662 --> 12:17.110
And then what do you do when
not traveling?

12:19.020 --> 12:20.689
I do this and that.

12:21.555 --> 12:23.806
I do not know what to call it.

12:25.569 --> 12:27.967
We all have so many options
these days, right?

12:32.504 --> 12:34.966
And then? How are you
Julia?

12:35.647 --> 12:38.803
Okay, very, very well.

12:38.804 --> 12:40.600
How do you feel about returning
to work?

12:41.101 --> 12:44.396
- Well, well.
- I'm surprised.

12:45.115 --> 12:47.312
The last time he spoke
on leave.

12:47.979 --> 12:51.008
You know, did not talk much
about it.

12:51.008 --> 12:55.039
Do not blame her, I could not
with that work. Could you?

12:55.040 --> 12:56.290
No, I could not.

12:58.468 --> 13:01.517
Hey, I need to keep an eye
the dinner would you ...?

13:01.518 --> 13:02.668
Yeah, right.

13:10.258 --> 13:13.820
- Have you lived here a long time?
- A while.

13:25.197 --> 13:26.385
Do you live alone?

13:30.528 --> 13:31.723
Yes.

13:38.531 --> 13:40.367
In case you need to use the phone.

13:42.673 --> 13:44.602
You said you had to fix things.

13:46.451 --> 13:47.664
Thank you.

14:02.134 --> 14:03.959
Me.
I'll call you later.

14:05.777 --> 14:07.408
- No luck?
- No.

14:08.332 --> 14:11.730
- Carrots?
- No, I'm fine, thanks.

14:13.132 --> 14:16.695
I hate to ask, could you pass here
another half hour ...

14:16.696 --> 14:18.778
... Until my cousin again
home?

14:19.097 --> 14:21.988
I know I'm teasing,
but it is one of those days.

14:21.989 --> 14:26.861
Yeah, right. Sit back, relax,
solve this.

14:28.836 --> 14:32.370
Tell you what, call the airport
and see if I can locate your luggage.

14:32.541 --> 14:34.681
I would not worry about it.

14:34.855 --> 14:38.430
I left my cousin's information
and said they would call.

14:39.256 --> 14:42.230
- But your cousin is not home, do you?
- Prima.

14:42.231 --> 14:43.394
Your cousin is not.

14:43.395 --> 14:47.287
If you press these people,
will be the last to receive anything.

14:49.010 --> 14:51.603
- What airline was it?
- Quantus.

14:52.380 --> 14:57.265
Hello. I communicate with luggage
Quantus lost at LAX, please.

15:01.056 --> 15:04.911
Yeah, hi. Looking for a luggage ...
Wait.

15:05.077 --> 15:10.805
- Do you have the receipt for the suitcase?
- No, I was in my wallet.

15:12.319 --> 15:14.753
No, it does not.
What is your name?

15:14.754 --> 15:16.042
Jones.

15:17.208 --> 15:18.649
Did John Jones?

15:18.650 --> 15:20.197
My parents ...

15:21.365 --> 15:23.645
- It's Jones.
- ... Not very creative.

15:24.578 --> 15:25.906
If, Sydney.

15:28.604 --> 15:29.741
Sure.

15:33.491 --> 15:37.223
I see.
They have no name Jones.

15:38.461 --> 15:39.675
How?

15:40.027 --> 15:42.120
- What?
- Your luggage, describe.

15:42.121 --> 15:43.298
Wait a minute.

15:43.299 --> 15:47.466
Black suitcase, medium, a ribbon
red on the handle.

15:47.665 --> 15:50.202
Well, if I describe the luggage ...

15:54.023 --> 15:55.834
When will it return?

15:57.000 --> 16:00.398
- This person does not want to deal with me.
- Do not worry, hang up.

16:00.399 --> 16:01.399
Do not worry.

16:01.400 --> 16:05.106
He says the supervisor will return in
an hour, how your cousin is already at home?

16:05.330 --> 16:09.239
I do not know, she did not expect
going to surprise her.

16:10.354 --> 16:12.062
This gets very complicated.

16:13.159 --> 16:14.920
What if you stay for dinner?

16:15.808 --> 16:19.545
You can call the supervisor
in an hour. What do you think?

16:19.546 --> 16:22.020
I think it's a great idea. Thank you.

16:22.862 --> 16:26.380
Okay, I'll call you.
Thank you.

16:27.380 --> 16:28.685
Well, it's fixed.

16:28.720 --> 16:31.509
Now, I need to prepare,
feel at home

16:31.509 --> 16:36.092
no more wine in the kitchen
I'll go for a moment.

17:15.674 --> 17:18.374
- John?
- Yes.

17:18.575 --> 17:23.686
Tell me, I know what you and
Julia did in Sydney.

17:23.688 --> 17:25.219
Do not forget any details.

17:25.520 --> 17:28.102
Just hang out.

17:28.502 --> 17:30.033
How did you meet?

17:30.643 --> 17:32.232
For a mutual friend.

17:32.233 --> 17:34.271
We met at a party
birthday.

17:35.458 --> 17:41.636
- But they spent time together.
- If we did some traveling,

17:41.636 --> 17:45.269
I wished I could spend more time
with it is a great girl.

17:45.270 --> 17:48.109
Yes. Does she suggested that I
visited?

17:48.110 --> 17:51.966
- If you thought that we'd get along well.
- Is typical of Julia.

17:54.069 --> 17:57.260
- It's strange too.
- What?

17:57.473 --> 17:59.692
I talked to her 2 days ago
and do not mention it.

18:01.348 --> 18:04.354
Very strange, maybe I forgot.

18:04.555 --> 18:08.781
It is unlikely, she always
tells me everything. It's weird.

18:09.752 --> 18:11.381
Do not mention at all.

18:12.580 --> 18:14.801
I hope you mention me
the next time they speak.

18:17.084 --> 18:19.987
You're right, we will
call.

18:20.554 --> 18:22.228
I'll get the phone.

18:22.529 --> 18:25.651
Julia sure you do not realize that
we are both here.

18:30.425 --> 18:36.655
I think it is 9 am
Sydney should be awake.

18:37.279 --> 18:41.523
Guess what? I do
yoga on Wednesdays.

18:42.769 --> 18:44.485
I do not know if he's there.

18:45.787 --> 18:49.852
But not Wednesday.
It's Thursday morning there, right?

18:51.012 --> 18:54.120
You're right. Van later
us.

18:55.071 --> 18:56.221
It's Thursday.

19:00.655 --> 19:01.851
Is ringing.

19:11.233 --> 19:12.351
Answering machine.

19:13.563 --> 19:16.240
Hi Jules, I am, I'm here
John.

19:16.241 --> 19:19.301
Who greets you. He had a trip
nightmare.

19:19.302 --> 19:23.798
I wish I had said was coming.
In preparation. Whatever.

19:24.182 --> 19:26.739
I hope you are well, call me
when you can. Goodbye.

19:27.858 --> 19:31.570
You should still be asleep.
I continue cooking.

19:31.983 --> 19:34.862
Get comfortable.
My guests will not be long.

19:34.863 --> 19:36.486
- Are you okay?
- Good.

19:37.643 --> 19:41.589
- Where is your bathroom?
- Sure, here.

19:42.763 --> 19:44.815
Down the hall, second door
to the left.

19:44.816 --> 19:45.966
Thank you.

19:47.957 --> 19:49.809
What? You're limping.

19:50.258 --> 19:53.447
I had a sprained ankle
is still healing.

19:53.447 --> 19:56.662
Oh, sprained ankle
This is not good, John.

19:57.163 --> 19:59.949
Were you drunk, John?

20:01.772 --> 20:03.490
Come on, admit it.

20:03.917 --> 20:07.155
I have been giving
red wine tonight.

20:08.693 --> 20:10.838
I am a man of white wine.

20:12.001 --> 20:16.305
The red is hard on my body.
Too rustic.

20:16.405 --> 20:17.933
In addition to stained teeth.

20:22.720 --> 20:24.312
<i> Have you been to Romania? </ i></i>

20:24.513 --> 20:27.331
<i>They drink much wine  and all
have red teeth. </ i></i>

20:30.733 --> 20:33.820
Or maybe eat much red meat,
I do not know but have red teeth

20:34.021 --> 20:35.510
Those are the Romanians.

20:44.408 --> 20:45.652
Magnificent.

21:06.067 --> 21:07.791
Who's Coming to Dinner?

21:08.360 --> 21:09.917
Only old friends.

21:10.583 --> 21:11.944
What do they do?

21:11.973 --> 21:17.015
One is an artist, journalist,
lawyer.

21:17.016 --> 21:18.266
Will you advocate?

21:18.530 --> 21:21.265
Yes. Roman.
It's brilliant

21:21.366 --> 21:24.216
I say that should change
sides, start your own practice

21:24.217 --> 21:27.627
make more money, but it will not.
Matter of principle.

21:31.112 --> 21:34.087
Is a tax attorney?

21:34.188 --> 21:38.683
God, no. He is a prosecutor. Work in
the District Attorney's Office.

21:38.883 --> 21:40.640
Very talented.

21:44.904 --> 21:46.480
You planned a dinner
very nice.

21:47.125 --> 21:51.152
I ... I'm exhausted.
I think I'll go.

21:51.494 --> 21:53.168
I am very tired.

21:53.793 --> 21:55.922
My cousin should be in
home now.

21:55.923 --> 21:59.410
No, do not be ridiculous.
I can not leave you helpless.

21:59.411 --> 22:01.718
Oh no, I will not ruin your dinner.

22:01.719 --> 22:05.380
I'm tired and I'm not that interesting
and guests will have.

22:05.781 --> 22:09.859
No, sit, sit.
It will be an informal dinner.

22:09.860 --> 22:13.229
A little wine, light conversation,
not have to do anything.

22:13.397 --> 22:15.578
My guests are very funny.

22:15.925 --> 22:18.533
Trust me.
You will be captivated.

22:18.534 --> 22:19.684
Seriously.

22:24.788 --> 22:27.367
And then what time
it all starts.

22:28.152 --> 22:31.782
It is assumed that at 8 but as
usual, will come later.

22:31.883 --> 22:33.499
<i> ... several robberies including one
$ 300.000 ...</ i></i>

22:33.600 --> 22:35.421
It is so hard to be punctual.

22:35.422 --> 22:36.422
<i> ... an unidentified woman ...</ i></i>

22:36.423 --> 22:38.871
A matter of hours,
make a list.

22:40.272 --> 22:41.404
It's not that hard.

22:41.405 --> 22:43.246
Can you keep quiet
in time?

22:43.647 --> 22:45.516
Is flat. It's simple.

22:45.889 --> 22:48.403
<i> - Management planning.
- ... A robbery at an art gallery ...</ i></i>

22:48.404 --> 22:50.024
Shut the fuck up!

22:51.446 --> 22:52.838
Excuse me?

22:53.869 --> 22:58.096
You can be friends with Julia
but do not allow that language ...

22:58.097 --> 22:59.506
... I think it will be better
you go.

22:59.913 --> 23:01.366
There's your fucking Julia.

23:01.367 --> 23:05.434
<i> ... a man probably responsible
of a bank robbery this afternoon </ i></i>

23:05.435 --> 23:09.854
<i> an employee identified as the
Los Angeles resident John Taylor, </ i></i>

23:09.889 --> 23:12.877
<i> Taylor went to a branch
First National Bank, </ i></i>

23:12.878 --> 23:17.383
<i> assaulted a cashier and left

23:17.918 --> 23:20.942
<i>Taylor has previous convictions

23:21.243 --> 23:24.052

23:24.153 --> 23:28.766

23:29.281 --> 23:31.846
<i>In other news  Commissioner

23:36.805 --> 23:37.914
Sit.

23:40.135 --> 23:41.364
Sit!

24:14.724 --> 24:16.239
I do not care if you smoke.

24:23.804 --> 24:25.158
Do you mind if I smoke?

24:36.907 --> 24:38.356
Do not kill me, I'll have dinner.

24:42.565 --> 24:48.446
I'll cut your throat, you'll
in the bath, I'll eat your food,

24:49.002 --> 24:50.709
and sleep in your bed.

24:52.263 --> 24:53.469
Do you understand?

24:56.099 --> 25:01.201
I want you to take the phone call
your friends and tell them to fuck.

25:03.962 --> 25:05.177
Agreed.

25:18.006 --> 25:21.745
Rupert, I,
if you know you're delayed

25:21.746 --> 25:23.907
no matter, I must cancel.

25:25.587 --> 25:27.778
I have ... a terrible migraine.

25:29.920 --> 25:33.433
Yeah, you could call
others and apologize for me?

25:34.424 --> 25:39.456
No, no. All is well,
I'll see you tomorrow.

25:48.326 --> 25:49.550
Good boy.

26:21.692 --> 26:22.915
Oh, my God.

26:23.846 --> 26:26.120
You ...
... You're bleeding.

26:29.025 --> 26:33.890
I can deal with it ..
please let me ... some water ...

26:43.898 --> 26:45.028
Better.

26:47.490 --> 26:48.840
What the hell are you doing?

26:49.441 --> 26:51.170
Cleaning your dirty mess.

26:55.175 --> 26:57.196
I'm not playing
Understand?

27:00.779 --> 27:02.590
Do you understand?

27:19.169 --> 27:21.180
- News?
- Oh yes.

27:22.772 --> 27:25.246
You must be devastated.

27:27.257 --> 27:28.799
Yes, but get over it.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.533
- Hey was brutal.
- There will be 5 games the next season.

27:33.789 --> 27:35.795
I hope you did not bet money.

27:37.722 --> 27:38.832
That would be illegal.

27:40.062 --> 27:41.222
Right.

27:41.738 --> 27:43.734
- What is that?
- Statements by witnesses.

27:44.972 --> 27:46.377
Do we track a witness?

27:46.412 --> 27:49.455
If the cashier. It's who identified
Taylor.

27:49.556 --> 27:52.339
Taylor says he was in several
occasions.

27:52.495 --> 27:53.687
Really?

27:53.688 --> 27:58.177
Taylor has no account, one would
because he liked it.

27:58.791 --> 28:01.685
Asked her out at least
3 times

28:01.872 --> 28:05.439
she received a number
and never called, John stopped going.

28:05.709 --> 28:07.232
Until today.

28:08.343 --> 28:10.222
Is your home phone.

28:10.323 --> 28:13.520
I think that
or is an idiot, o. ..

28:14.372 --> 28:17.964
the game was romantic
alibi to study the bank.

28:18.988 --> 28:20.707
Well, he's an idiot anyway

28:21.430 --> 28:24.085
not give someone your phone
and then steal.

28:27.750 --> 28:29.750
Wore a wig
and sunglasses.

28:31.163 --> 28:32.337
That was ingenious.

28:47.668 --> 28:48.904
Why did you do?

28:51.722 --> 28:52.961
Do what?

28:53.112 --> 28:54.312
Stealing.

28:56.421 --> 28:58.173
Why not win honestly?

28:58.840 --> 29:01.589
I do not care, alone,
I have curiosity.

29:03.694 --> 29:05.641
All the money is spent.

29:06.505 --> 29:07.647
Yes?

29:11.618 --> 29:13.023
Do you know what the hell?

29:13.224 --> 29:14.424
I'm just saying.

29:17.655 --> 29:19.209
Stealing is not the answer.

29:34.041 --> 29:35.757
Okay, so things will be.

29:39.208 --> 29:40.547
I'll kill you

29:41.578 --> 29:43.287
It will be a difficult decision.

29:46.489 --> 29:50.852
But if you're ready,
may change his mind.

29:52.774 --> 29:55.912
To begin with, you will keep your
ignorant opinions to yourself.

29:56.411 --> 29:58.065
Because I do not know.

30:00.125 --> 30:04.848
If you follow my instructions,
and you get out of my way to morning

30:05.148 --> 30:06.654
will not get hurt.

30:10.935 --> 30:13.667
Just help me
overnight.

30:14.561 --> 30:15.733
Right?

30:25.275 --> 30:26.515
Do you understand?

31:12.826 --> 31:14.818
I told them I was going to prepare duck.

31:14.919 --> 31:16.638
They knew it was a special night.

31:16.986 --> 31:18.457
Be here.

31:19.968 --> 31:23.785
They are so unreliable.
I always arrive early.

31:23.786 --> 31:25.045
I'm always on time.

31:26.317 --> 31:30.174
I received many calls,
tasks, we left late.

31:30.174 --> 31:34.268
I'm so sorry, Warwick,
we are tired, we can not go.

31:42.652 --> 31:44.869
It is a scoundrel,
Right?

31:59.844 --> 32:05.181
Yes, Rupert and I have seen 2 times
I can not wait for the DVD.

32:07.230 --> 32:11.665
Why do not you see?
Seriously, you should go.

32:16.077 --> 32:18.048
Well, Rupert, as well imitate.

32:21.070 --> 32:22.313
John.

32:25.468 --> 32:27.976
- Sorry.
- I have not seen ...

32:34.845 --> 32:38.725
Monica, are you okay?
Sorry Rupert.

32:43.291 --> 32:44.484
Sorry about that.

32:56.503 --> 32:57.645
Hey everyone.

32:59.151 --> 33:02.487
This is our new friend, John.
Say hello to John.

33:02.488 --> 33:03.732
Hi John.

33:05.887 --> 33:07.519
Missed a moment.

33:08.233 --> 33:10.371
- Are you okay?
- We were worried about you.

33:10.938 --> 33:12.100
If we were.

33:14.524 --> 33:16.531
- Were what?
- Worried about you.

33:17.378 --> 33:19.358
Take your damn hands
phenomenon.

33:20.472 --> 33:21.717
Fuck you!

33:25.018 --> 33:26.164
Manners.

33:34.387 --> 33:37.805
Were you hungry, Rupert.
I swallow, little piggy.

33:39.874 --> 33:41.105
Then Roman,

33:41.611 --> 33:43.293
Any good event recently?

33:43.294 --> 33:45.591
John is interested in the process
in the judicial process.

33:45.592 --> 33:47.309
You know I can
talk about that, Warwick.

33:47.875 --> 33:48.941
It is unethical.

33:48.942 --> 33:52.282
Come on. Just us.
Among these 4 walls.

33:53.761 --> 33:55.461
It is so boring, Roman.

33:55.461 --> 33:58.295
After all we have
real criminal here at this table.

33:59.557 --> 34:02.196
So,
Are you new to Los Angeles, John?

34:08.886 --> 34:11.617
Yes, just arrived from Sydney, Australia.

34:12.626 --> 34:15.746
- Very good friend.
- Chelsea, please.

34:15.748 --> 34:16.873
Get a grip please.

34:18.250 --> 34:22.418
Monica and I went to this exhibition
Caravaggio, did last week?

34:23.510 --> 34:24.742
Ah, yes, how was it?

34:25.167 --> 34:26.453
Amazing.

34:26.654 --> 34:30.072
There are only a few pieces, but have 2
different illuminations

34:30.072 --> 34:31.449
of each painting.

34:32.824 --> 34:35.092
A colorless,
the other ...

34:35.623 --> 34:39.094
If illuminated paintings
detail, thrilling.

34:39.129 --> 34:40.759
I think I have no Caravaggio.

34:41.217 --> 34:42.452
Kidding.

34:42.525 --> 34:45.445
- When painted?
- About 1600.

34:45.926 --> 34:47.610
An interesting character indeed.

34:47.876 --> 34:50.129
It was a pervert and a murderer.

34:50.766 --> 34:54.003
- What was it?
- Well, yes, but other than that ...

34:54.003 --> 34:56.629
Embarrass most
the current criminal.

34:57.030 --> 34:58.693
Sounds creepy.

34:59.324 --> 35:01.602
I think I have a book
somewhere. Wait.

35:01.603 --> 35:02.803
I'll see if I find it.

35:07.115 --> 35:08.307
I love that.

35:13.323 --> 35:14.570
Here it is.

35:26.012 --> 35:27.848
Oh, God. Chelsea.

35:29.734 --> 35:34.913
All right. All right.
Here we go.

35:36.192 --> 35:37.731
John. John!

35:52.500 --> 35:54.464
Yes, I know, poor creature.

36:00.002 --> 36:01.785
Are you going to apologize to Chelsea?

36:03.537 --> 36:04.649
Excuse me?

36:05.018 --> 36:07.326
The Demolitions and
crushed.

36:14.991 --> 36:16.135
Well?

36:22.229 --> 36:25.311
Sorry. Did not see you.

36:33.311 --> 36:35.790
So John, what
of new and interesting?

36:38.606 --> 36:42.344
What is new is that I'm sitting
a bloody lunatic.

36:44.220 --> 36:45.963
There's nothing interesting about it.

37:01.196 --> 37:03.257
I've had worse days
that, Warwick.

37:29.059 --> 37:31.369
Look at this.
I like it.

37:54.735 --> 37:56.330
From midnight.

38:13.980 --> 38:17.452
You know, Roman, I'm beginning
to get your taste.

38:23.561 --> 38:24.952
And the end.

38:37.874 --> 38:43.581
John nervously
a place for you on each page.

39:06.780 --> 39:08.485
Do we record this?

39:08.928 --> 39:11.430
- You mean a. ..
- Strips of the month.

39:11.531 --> 39:13.490
Whatever you
is down.

39:13.491 --> 39:17.500
All right. Call quarter
evidence, tell them to come down.

39:21.519 --> 39:23.803
<i>CRIMINAL MIND  </ i></i>

39:35.708 --> 39:41.716
You're the most beautiful creature in which
has settled my eyes, exquisite.

39:41.717 --> 39:43.954
Sure you tell them that
all the girls.

39:43.955 --> 39:45.672
You're a womanizer.

39:45.673 --> 39:48.609
You are different, you are special.

39:49.010 --> 39:50.849
How I can believe you?

39:53.644 --> 39:58.297
It's true. Many women have
traveled the road to Warwick,

39:59.340 --> 40:01.446
interesting ways.

40:01.647 --> 40:04.552
We can not blame them,
for the love that I share.

40:04.553 --> 40:08.113
I know, but what about Julia?

40:08.542 --> 40:12.256
- She is in Australia.
- But you're with her, she is ...

40:12.557 --> 40:13.657
is ...

40:15.170 --> 40:19.572
She is the boat of the night
loving daughter of the universe,

40:21.436 --> 40:23.938
My heart stops
flicker before you.

40:26.230 --> 40:30.183
Do not brake
come to Warwick.

40:32.653 --> 40:33.631
Warwick.

40:33.632 --> 40:37.466
I'm very boring, Warwick,
there are other people here.

40:37.967 --> 40:40.053
Oh, I forgot.

40:40.757 --> 40:43.141
Are not all fun?

40:44.736 --> 40:48.247
I can not speak for all but
I'm having great.

40:48.548 --> 40:52.218
Warwick, did not have the
last party at Super 8?

40:52.687 --> 40:56.212
You're right, we do.
I will show.

40:56.413 --> 40:58.686
Roman, come, help me
John.

41:00.512 --> 41:04.056
Ready?
1, 2, 3.

41:13.668 --> 41:16.072
I wish you had been, you missed
a tremendous party.

41:34.269 --> 41:36.383
I myself did the hair
and makeup.

42:12.458 --> 42:15.959
It's so beautiful.
So beautiful.

42:52.113 --> 42:54.466
PellÃ­zcame, Roman,
I have a party.

42:55.478 --> 42:56.668
Hello you.

42:57.223 --> 43:00.702
They're all here. Everyone is here
and here they all are.

43:01.052 --> 43:03.768
Rupert, keep these people busy
or I'll have you busy for you.

43:06.033 --> 43:07.463
Hello, Chelsea.

43:11.304 --> 43:12.676
Is not it great?

43:12.677 --> 43:15.671
I was worried that
no one would come but this is great.

43:15.672 --> 43:17.225
Are you having fun?

43:18.803 --> 43:21.920
Courage, John, is a party.

43:23.199 --> 43:24.967
It does not look very happy.

43:25.168 --> 43:27.772
You only need to enter
the holiday spirit.

43:28.073 --> 43:30.296
Chelsea, Rupert, come here.

43:31.500 --> 43:36.027
Ready,
1, 2, 3. Champagne!

44:02.407 --> 44:03.598
Hey, John.

44:05.793 --> 44:07.915
Oh, yes.
It's almost time, huh?

44:07.916 --> 44:09.705
Would you feel photogenic.

44:12.413 --> 44:14.202
Warwick, can I join I can
the conga line?

44:14.203 --> 44:15.353
What?

44:17.919 --> 44:20.044
What if I can join
the conga line.

44:23.727 --> 44:25.959
I think we have a few minutes.

44:26.619 --> 44:29.716
But you have to drink
cocktail if you want to stay in shape.

44:31.614 --> 44:34.618
- What's in?
- Do you want it or not?

44:35.804 --> 44:39.093
Well, whatever you want, I must
prepare for the photo.

44:40.143 --> 44:41.508
I drink.

44:43.365 --> 44:46.555
Hey Rupert, make a cocktail for John.

45:14.564 --> 45:19.216
I think you're ready,
John. Conga!

45:31.392 --> 45:35.779
John, look what you've done.
Causes a heap.

46:48.666 --> 46:50.565
Hey you, not even
see you there.

46:50.566 --> 46:54.425
Why, if I'm good.
What? yes, I love you.

46:54.426 --> 46:57.965
Yes, I love you!
Say it again. Thank you.

46:57.966 --> 47:00.197
To you I've been waiting for.
Shake.

47:00.198 --> 47:02.734
Come on, shake.
Give it to me.

47:06.321 --> 47:10.042
How much did you drink?
Get away from me. You're a whore.

47:16.980 --> 47:18.684
Hey, how have you been?

47:19.762 --> 47:24.116
Yes. No, it was better than
expected. It turned out well.

47:33.248 --> 47:35.400
No, it was great.
It's a great party.

47:40.633 --> 47:43.288
Oh, yeah, yeah.

47:43.571 --> 47:46.461
Everyone, everyone.

48:29.032 --> 48:32.050
- So you have fun?
- Yes I did.

48:35.085 --> 48:40.703
Sorry to Teri and Adam, they always
a bouquet of flowers when they come.

48:40.972 --> 48:42.128
All right.

48:46.172 --> 48:50.727
- Will I stay here tonight?
- I thought you would.

48:51.128 --> 48:52.622
Yes?

48:53.043 --> 48:54.846
Have you got tired of me?

48:55.130 --> 49:01.051
- No. Not yet.
- Good.

49:03.093 --> 49:04.737
Oh, that reminds me ...

49:13.948 --> 49:16.926
Okay, okay.

49:30.805 --> 49:32.048
All right.

51:12.771 --> 51:13.983
Hello?

51:14.984 --> 51:16.096
Hello.

51:21.547 --> 51:22.712
Hello?

51:31.013 --> 51:32.188
Yes.

51:32.915 --> 51:37.123
Hello, sir. Wilson, sorry
I was not sure if he was here.

51:38.778 --> 51:43.338
His friend ... Are you
OK?

51:43.339 --> 51:46.428
Okay, okay.
It's a little drunk.

51:46.429 --> 51:48.545
He has been in his character
overnight.

51:49.074 --> 51:52.159
- What do you mean by character?
- We had a costume party.

51:52.609 --> 51:53.791
Oh, God.

51:53.792 --> 51:56.755
He plays his character
jumping into the pool.

51:58.274 --> 52:00.260
It has become boring.

52:00.461 --> 52:04.707
I was suffering,
by the sound they made.

52:06.088 --> 52:08.505
No, I've said no
mix wines.

52:09.662 --> 52:12.416
I'm so sorry
the bothering.

52:12.417 --> 52:15.520
But I think it's over
I promise that there will be more noise.

52:15.521 --> 52:19.652
- Well, if all is well.
- Yeah, thanks, I'm sorry.

52:20.577 --> 52:23.207
- You will have to excuse me.
- Yeah, I quit.

52:23.208 --> 52:24.343
Take care of yourself.

52:48.207 --> 52:53.586
- Okay, is that you drank too much.
- Excuse me, anything else?

52:53.714 --> 52:56.419
Are you sure he's
OK?

52:56.420 --> 52:59.602
It seems to take off the mask.

52:59.803 --> 53:03.044
Thank God! I have tried
do it all night.

53:03.445 --> 53:07.959
It is very drunk, I think it's time
you go to bed, and me too.

53:08.036 --> 53:10.357
If nothing more ...

53:12.347 --> 53:13.993
- I guess not.
- Okay.

53:14.194 --> 53:16.593
- Good night.
- Good night.

53:17.686 --> 53:18.804
Good night.

53:21.182 --> 53:22.455
Good night.

53:23.844 --> 53:26.082
Come to bed, John.

53:46.029 --> 53:51.040
What if I go and call the police?
What will you do?

53:51.041 --> 53:52.949
Warwick probably
will collapse

53:52.950 --> 53:55.332
is not the best
mastermind of the world.

53:55.333 --> 53:56.483
Shut up!

53:57.966 --> 54:02.257
-What you should be thinking ...
- But what if the police come ...

54:04.693 --> 54:05.806
Shut up!

54:07.869 --> 54:11.869
As you should be worried
Warwick, is your foot.

54:13.847 --> 54:15.583
I think that needs attention.

54:21.612 --> 54:23.765
Attention. Yes.

54:24.566 --> 54:29.084
I'll get your foot bleeding
stop leak in my apartment

54:29.085 --> 54:30.808
once and for all.

54:48.901 --> 54:50.039
Not covered.

54:50.506 --> 54:51.977
I told you already.

54:52.666 --> 54:56.816
- It is an elective procedure?
- Love, I'll be fine.

54:58.587 --> 55:01.706
Not good. It's a damn
joke.

55:02.007 --> 55:03.659
Can you go to work tomorrow?

55:03.660 --> 55:05.087
Yes, I'll be fine.

55:05.688 --> 55:07.880
You can not keep taking it.

55:08.227 --> 55:11.327
They damage your body pain
your liver collapse.

55:11.328 --> 55:12.793
Okay, doctor.

55:18.600 --> 55:20.003
This is horrible.

55:23.693 --> 55:25.262
I get money.

55:26.092 --> 55:27.195
No.

55:29.297 --> 55:32.329
Hey, come here.
Please, love, come here.

55:39.386 --> 55:41.113
You will not rob anyone.

55:41.807 --> 55:43.478
It just will not happen.

55:44.453 --> 55:45.860
I've done before.

55:46.135 --> 55:48.292
If you went to prison and why.

55:49.860 --> 55:51.387
I will not enter.

55:54.932 --> 55:56.791
Everything will be fine.

56:10.754 --> 56:12.704
Both are very good.

56:14.020 --> 56:16.896
I can not decide.
Which do you prefer?

56:24.219 --> 56:25.728
I'll decide later.

56:27.395 --> 56:28.849
What will you do me?

56:34.268 --> 56:36.179
Good move, Roman.

56:36.954 --> 56:41.075
- Warwick. Warwick please listen to me.
- I hear you.

56:43.273 --> 56:45.141
Please do not do this, Warwick.

56:46.654 --> 56:47.787
Right?

56:49.525 --> 56:51.252
Please let me go.

56:51.953 --> 56:53.849
Warwick, I'll do anything.

56:55.801 --> 56:57.904
- Warwick.
- I would not do that, Roman.

57:00.873 --> 57:04.764
Every action has a reaction
equal and opposite, John.

57:05.664 --> 57:06.904
What?

57:07.205 --> 57:08.788
That's physics.

57:09.630 --> 57:11.142
It is the law of nature.

57:14.716 --> 57:17.765
Oh, sweet.
Do not cry.

57:20.103 --> 57:21.986
What I can do
to make you feel better?

57:22.397 --> 57:24.218
Please let me go.

57:24.919 --> 57:26.196
Please do not kill me.

57:29.172 --> 57:33.356
You are my guest,
and I'm glad you're here.

57:34.121 --> 57:36.832
But you can only blame
yourself.

58:38.393 --> 58:39.967
And then where is it?

58:41.965 --> 58:43.133
Who?

58:44.188 --> 58:45.304
Julia.

58:49.606 --> 58:51.114
It's in Bangkok.

58:51.215 --> 58:53.802
It is planning to go to Hanoi
not yet been decided.

58:56.299 --> 58:57.876
Who has not decided?

58:59.927 --> 59:01.049
Julia.

59:02.342 --> 59:03.564
Who is she?

59:05.493 --> 59:08.645
She's the girl you met at
Australia, silly.

59:10.714 --> 59:12.984
I've never been to Australia, Warwick.

59:14.693 --> 59:16.796
You mean you lied?

59:18.450 --> 59:21.143
Yes. I lied.

59:23.119 --> 59:24.847
It speaks well
your character.

59:26.683 --> 59:28.480
And you're Julia, Warwick.

59:31.436 --> 59:32.721
What?

59:33.958 --> 59:35.554
You're Julia.

59:36.998 --> 59:40.030
Roman, Rupert, Monica.

59:41.194 --> 59:42.845
All are you, Warwick.

59:47.747 --> 59:51.499
The fascinating thing about John is that I have
others to attend,

59:51.600 --> 59:53.400
I can not be a
inattentive host.

59:59.806 --> 01:00:01.827
Does anyone fancy a final cocktail?

01:00:03.911 --> 01:00:08.306
Monica Â¿? Oh, I forgot,
Do you prefer a dessert wine, coffee?

01:00:08.878 --> 01:00:10.345
Go ahead.
Rupert Â¿?

01:00:12.879 --> 01:00:14.575
Keep the bottle to Roman.

01:00:18.685 --> 01:00:19.947
Now what?

01:00:21.854 --> 01:00:25.309
Now it's time to silence
John, it means ...

01:00:25.950 --> 01:00:29.757
reflection, silence,
OK?

01:00:31.219 --> 01:00:35.039
It is very entertaining.
Even I am your guest, right?

01:00:35.274 --> 01:00:36.525
Of course you are.

01:00:37.850 --> 01:00:39.094
Well ...

01:00:42.525 --> 01:00:44.140
What do you think?

01:00:47.018 --> 01:00:48.136
Wait ...

01:00:48.739 --> 01:00:52.826
If you win, I give you freedom.

01:00:53.227 --> 01:00:55.580
But what if I get lost?

01:00:55.781 --> 01:00:58.532
You have my life, is not that enough?

01:00:58.533 --> 01:01:01.711
- I can not give more than that, Warwick.
- Yes, indeed.

01:01:02.531 --> 01:01:04.128
But that's what I have.

01:01:04.913 --> 01:01:06.581
Have you ever played chess before?

01:01:06.582 --> 01:01:09.122
- Yes, once or twice.
- Very good.

01:01:10.917 --> 01:01:14.028
To tell me which piece to move,
you tell me a letter y. ..

01:01:14.029 --> 01:01:15.448
... A corresponding number.

01:01:15.449 --> 01:01:18.207
For example if you want to move the bishop
say ...

01:01:18.408 --> 01:01:21.351
... Bishop to king-3.

01:01:22.828 --> 01:01:26.516
Now I move my tower
Horse-7.

01:01:26.617 --> 01:01:28.775
Okay, and what is the best
strategy?

01:01:29.076 --> 01:01:33.660
That's the detail, do not control the
opponent's pieces, only yours.

01:01:33.961 --> 01:01:36.799
But if you know your opponent, you know
weaknesses,

01:01:38.098 --> 01:01:41.761
if you play well, you can influence
the behavior of your opponent.

01:01:43.138 --> 01:01:47.920
I see. If you listen and
pretend to be fascinated ...

01:01:47.921 --> 01:01:50.960
that I teach chess
So will you love me?

01:01:52.064 --> 01:01:54.708
Yeah, nice try
do not need anything.

01:01:54.909 --> 01:01:57.214
No need to pretend interest.

01:01:58.643 --> 01:02:01.194
What can you do to me?

01:02:01.495 --> 01:02:02.958
What can you do?

01:02:03.459 --> 01:02:07.805
The satisfaction of winning should
be enough for a man like you.

01:02:09.731 --> 01:02:12.827
No.
"To the victor goes the spoils."

01:02:14.891 --> 01:02:20.104
- How would pamper me, John?
- I do not know. How would you like?

01:02:24.746 --> 01:02:26.182
Let me think.

01:02:26.627 --> 01:02:28.729
- King.
- Yes.

01:02:29.125 --> 01:02:31.553
The whole game revolves around
the king.

01:02:31.554 --> 01:02:33.619
It is the part with less power.

01:02:33.793 --> 01:02:38.003
Their movements are limited,
Only then, one at a time.

01:02:39.578 --> 01:02:42.695
Sometimes the pawn is the most
important.

01:02:42.983 --> 01:02:44.991
It is the most ordinary piece ...

01:02:44.992 --> 01:02:49.080
is simple in its movement,
but used properly ...

01:02:49.081 --> 01:02:51.008
can be fully
devastating.

01:02:51.751 --> 01:02:54.047
It may seem that you
front,

01:02:54.448 --> 01:02:58.909
but if you pay attention,
your opponent may surprise you ...

01:03:01.789 --> 01:03:03.035
... A movement.

01:03:03.447 --> 01:03:05.112
That's the beauty of this game.

01:03:07.194 --> 01:03:09.458
I know you can do
when you lose.

01:03:10.387 --> 01:03:12.408
- Yes.
- I turn to move, right?

01:03:12.409 --> 01:03:16.073
- Yes, but okay.
- Queen G-6.

01:03:16.628 --> 01:03:19.885
- Well, then, when you win ...
- Checkmate.

01:03:22.333 --> 01:03:23.528
What?

01:03:24.993 --> 01:03:26.383
Checkmate.

01:03:26.884 --> 01:03:28.122
How did that happen?

01:03:29.245 --> 01:03:31.023
How did you do that?

01:03:31.124 --> 01:03:34.435
- We Warwick, untie.
- But he had the perfect reward.

01:03:34.936 --> 01:03:38.449
You said that I would unleash
if he won, Warwick, come on.

01:03:39.150 --> 01:03:44.156
Have you played this before.
Trickster.

01:03:49.055 --> 01:03:51.139
You're a damned liar, Warwick.

01:04:07.473 --> 01:04:11.577
I may be many things, John,
but something I'm not is a liar.

01:04:12.370 --> 01:04:13.880
Feel free to leave.

01:04:24.789 --> 01:04:27.889
You really are a
negligible small, eh, John?

01:04:28.429 --> 01:04:31.301
Showed no conviction, no struggle.

01:04:31.802 --> 01:04:35.764
I'd let them do what
wanted. That is just what I did.

01:04:35.765 --> 01:04:38.458
In fact, I think I enjoyed it.

01:04:39.597 --> 01:04:41.082
You are nothing.

01:04:42.666 --> 01:04:47.084
You're disposable, forgettable
a replacement part.

01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:48.922
You are nothing.

01:04:49.608 --> 01:04:51.150
It is as if they existed.

01:04:56.164 --> 01:04:59.624
What are you doing? John,
What do you do?

01:05:00.795 --> 01:05:04.207
John, that down, John.
Stop please.

01:05:04.308 --> 01:05:06.001
Treated me like an animal.

01:05:07.344 --> 01:05:09.655
I get involved in your
sick world.

01:05:11.318 --> 01:05:13.363
You took my dignity.

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:17.174
How dare you tell me
I'm nothing?

01:05:17.926 --> 01:05:19.267
But it's true.

01:06:10.874 --> 01:06:12.486
Hey, John.

01:06:14.633 --> 01:06:16.403
Look at that piece of ass.

01:06:26.513 --> 01:06:27.676
Love me!

01:06:33.951 --> 01:06:35.308
Love me!

01:09:19.163 --> 01:09:23.185
Warwick, know you have to take
two of these.

01:09:23.423 --> 01:09:24.654
No, no

01:09:25.957 --> 01:09:28.357
- He knows what he does.
- Really?

01:09:28.854 --> 01:09:31.589
I know you like,
you never know when you go, Monica

01:09:31.590 --> 01:09:33.705
but he needs to work
at work.

01:10:26.924 --> 01:10:28.468
Morton, what do you want?

01:10:28.469 --> 01:10:30.848
- Lieutenant, woke him up?
- No, I'm awake,

01:10:30.849 --> 01:10:33.727
- Very early.
- Yes, I know, sorry.

01:10:34.124 --> 01:10:35.613
Will want to see this.

01:10:36.014 --> 01:10:37.305
Okay, it happens.

01:10:40.124 --> 01:10:41.974
Come in, sit down,
I'm coming.

01:10:43.875 --> 01:10:45.260
Now I'm sure.

01:10:45.461 --> 01:10:47.164
John Taylor had help.

01:10:51.724 --> 01:10:53.609
One of the cashiers was
involved.

01:10:53.610 --> 01:10:55.000
Really?

01:10:55.001 --> 01:10:57.545
- I can use your television?
- I have not.

01:10:58.276 --> 01:10:59.626
Ah, I forgot.

01:11:04.665 --> 01:11:05.811
Very good.

01:11:06.773 --> 01:11:08.691
This is 3 weeks before the robbery.

01:11:09.272 --> 01:11:12.427
Taylor comes in,
full of the deposit slips.

01:11:13.408 --> 01:11:15.909
He is studying the bank.
That's it.

01:11:16.110 --> 01:11:17.674
How do you know who is Taylor?

01:11:18.753 --> 01:11:20.759
For the tattoo.

01:11:22.848 --> 01:11:24.048
That's him.

01:11:24.650 --> 01:11:27.208
According to the cashier
Simone De Marchi,

01:11:28.317 --> 01:11:29.918
this woman

01:11:29.919 --> 01:11:33.650
according to Simone, John enters
and asks her out,

01:11:34.195 --> 01:11:38.446
but if you notice,
He is not even close.

01:11:39.509 --> 01:11:43.151
Here is the time of the robbery,
John waiting in line,

01:11:44.052 --> 01:11:49.459
the cashier tells you that happens,
but he will not, lets move on to the back.

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:53.929
- He hopes, why do it?
- Simone wants treats.

01:11:53.930 --> 01:11:55.080
Exactly.

01:11:55.828 --> 01:11:57.935
She rings the alarm

01:11:59.018 --> 01:12:00.808
package does not
tracing

01:12:03.603 --> 01:12:05.659
could have done
any of these things

01:12:05.660 --> 01:12:07.531
or tell someone else.

01:12:08.085 --> 01:12:10.865
He had every opportunity,
but does nothing.

01:12:10.866 --> 01:12:14.972
And then this, a month ago
reservation for 2 weeks vacation.

01:12:14.973 --> 01:12:16.903
- Guess when they start.
- Today.

01:12:18.392 --> 01:12:20.925
He lied about what John was looking for ...

01:12:20.926 --> 01:12:24.225
because I needed a reason
to identify it and tell us.

01:12:25.393 --> 01:12:28.580
They are together.
Or were.

01:12:28.815 --> 01:12:31.131
She gets the money.
He got caught.

01:12:31.332 --> 01:12:33.108
Go girl.

01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:35.349
Taylor Got clues?

01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:38.001
Well, if we follow Simone
to find Taylor.

01:12:39.241 --> 01:12:42.818
- You think you go to look?
- When he discovered what he did, yes.

01:12:43.119 --> 01:12:44.642
Are you under surveillance?

01:12:45.077 --> 01:12:47.843
If Valdez is running
outside your home.

01:12:58.637 --> 01:13:01.870
<i> An employee identified him as
resident of Los Angeles, </ i></i>

01:13:01.871 --> 01:13:03.151
<i>John Taylor  ...</ i></i>

01:13:29.805 --> 01:13:33.853
I want to check a reservation,
I will meet my wife at 9

01:13:33.854 --> 01:13:35.923
want to make sure
everything is recorded.

01:13:18.024 --> 01:13:19.824
CAR RENTAL
AMERICAN

01:13:37.398 --> 01:13:40.111
- Name?
- Simone Pryer.

01:13:48.133 --> 01:13:52.555
If you are registered, a Ford Sedan
9 am.

01:13:53.529 --> 01:13:55.747
Thanks, have a good day.

01:14:02.044 --> 01:14:05.679
If you listen and
pretend to be fascinated ...

01:14:08.774 --> 01:14:11.007
No need
feign interest.

01:14:31.325 --> 01:14:34.277
Yes, I want to confirm a reservation,
for this morning.

01:14:35.506 --> 01:14:36.804
Sure, Los Angeles.

01:14:38.370 --> 01:14:39.985
First name Simone.

01:14:41.677 --> 01:14:42.859
Nothing.

01:14:43.915 --> 01:14:45.652
Agreed.
Thank you.

01:14:48.511 --> 01:14:50.525
De Simone Pryer.

01:14:53.176 --> 01:14:55.947
No?
Okay, thanks.

01:15:01.102 --> 01:15:06.034
Do you?
What place is?

01:15:08.894 --> 01:15:10.689
He receives at 9 am Right?

01:15:13.785 --> 01:15:15.028
Â¿8 o'clock?

01:15:15.956 --> 01:15:17.456
Everything will be fine.

01:15:37.875 --> 01:15:39.786
- What happened?
- Nothing, sir.

01:15:40.287 --> 01:15:42.043
A light came on
20 minutes ago.

01:15:42.444 --> 01:15:43.599
That's something.

01:15:48.078 --> 01:15:50.691
- It still surprises me.
- What?

01:15:51.334 --> 01:15:55.592
These people. They should know that there
way to get away with it.

01:15:56.036 --> 01:15:59.083
If there is a way, someone
will try. It's human nature.

01:15:59.084 --> 01:16:03.134
Not that. There is something working
wrong with your damn brain.

01:16:03.535 --> 01:16:07.031
Why can not understand the two?

01:16:07.132 --> 01:16:09.137
You'd be unemployed
if they did.

01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:14.080
The forces of law are
more than just a job, detective.

01:16:15.650 --> 01:16:17.489
Well, here it comes.

01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:30.818
Do you know the problem?
There is no deterrence.

01:16:31.019 --> 01:16:32.514
Look southeast Asia,

01:16:32.658 --> 01:16:35.878
spit in public in Singapore
and is grounds for arrest

01:16:35.959 --> 01:16:37.597
if you get caught with drugs
is the death penalty.

01:16:37.898 --> 01:16:39.862
It's a little extreme, no?

01:16:40.119 --> 01:16:41.830
Is it?

01:16:41.831 --> 01:16:44.128
Check the levels of crime
in Singapore

01:16:45.094 --> 01:16:47.935
People should understand that
the government is serious.

01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:51.064
America is a liberal site,
Why do I have?

01:16:52.598 --> 01:16:54.933
Hey, is turning.

01:17:15.684 --> 01:17:17.088
Come on!

01:17:24.376 --> 01:17:26.974
- Move your car!
- Shut up!

01:17:27.824 --> 01:17:29.030
Move!

01:17:43.364 --> 01:17:45.091
Now I could be anywhere.

01:17:45.092 --> 01:17:46.521
Should we continue?

01:17:47.806 --> 01:17:50.076
Your next. Look in the levels
lower.

01:17:50.677 --> 01:17:52.027
Agreed.

01:17:52.817 --> 01:17:54.513
Keep your radios
on.

01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:11.080
Do I expect?

01:18:11.081 --> 01:18:14.030
Love was so worried
for you.

01:18:14.031 --> 01:18:16.506
- No.
- What happened to your face?

01:18:19.079 --> 01:18:20.967
Listen, I do not know how I
found,

01:18:20.968 --> 01:18:25.130
you were looking for,
I've gone mad

01:18:25.131 --> 01:18:27.413
I'm desperate
the police on you

01:18:27.448 --> 01:18:31.087
do not know what to do, I changed
car was going to pick you up, love,

01:18:31.088 --> 01:18:32.739
I'm so happy to see ...

01:18:33.545 --> 01:18:35.055
You seem to feel better.

01:18:36.756 --> 01:18:38.174
Do not have pain this morning?

01:18:38.816 --> 01:18:40.733
- No, I'm ...
- Just stop.

01:18:41.241 --> 01:18:42.384
Okay, Simon?

01:18:46.726 --> 01:18:47.980
Why do this?

01:18:50.685 --> 01:18:53.562
Because you ... do.

01:18:55.105 --> 01:18:56.175
Am I what?

01:18:56.176 --> 01:18:59.529
The bank, even
I had to convince.

01:19:00.364 --> 01:19:05.291
What did you think you are a
career criminal.

01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:09.181
What did you think would happen?

01:19:16.153 --> 01:19:17.954
I wanted to trust you.

01:19:19.442 --> 01:19:25.946
Well, maybe we can still do so,
know the truth, are no different.

01:19:26.047 --> 01:19:29.354
... But what they do
is to give each team a half ...

01:19:33.767 --> 01:19:35.789
... Could actually
bet some money ...

01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:40.470
You need me. You can not cross
the border without me.

01:19:40.471 --> 01:19:44.899
... If you want to get into this with me,
I can get better points ...

01:19:57.431 --> 01:20:01.353
... You can join but the thing is
if you bet money that a team ...

01:20:28.126 --> 01:20:29.375
Hello?

01:20:31.164 --> 01:20:32.728
That's not enough to quit.

01:20:33.429 --> 01:20:34.829
Give me the keys.

01:20:43.608 --> 01:20:45.243
Here Warwick, what happens?

01:20:45.527 --> 01:20:49.549
Lieutenant, we have Simone, we
in the car, no money.

01:20:49.650 --> 01:20:51.121
No sign of Taylor.

01:20:51.422 --> 01:20:54.034
- Right.
- We will take you to the station.

01:20:54.430 --> 01:20:55.870
Have you seen Taylor?

01:20:56.329 --> 01:21:01.081
Not yet. Please check the roof and
stairs, then back.

01:21:01.549 --> 01:21:04.313
See you there, I address issues
locally.

01:21:05.283 --> 01:21:08.287
- But there is an order, sir.
- As I said, is local.

01:21:08.288 --> 01:21:09.740
I will call if I need them.

01:21:10.141 --> 01:21:11.684
Agreed.

01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:16.409
Really did not think you
go out with yours, do you?

01:21:16.410 --> 01:21:20.257
I swear if I am arrested,
you crawl to me.

01:21:20.606 --> 01:21:22.865
I can describe every detail
your home.

01:21:22.866 --> 01:21:26.023
I am a police officer, do you think
someone will believe you?

01:21:26.715 --> 01:21:27.858
Yes, I do.

01:21:30.071 --> 01:21:35.296
Glamour got, I gave it,
or you would not know how to hold your cup.

01:21:36.452 --> 01:21:38.026
Now what, Warwick.

01:21:38.127 --> 01:21:41.566
Well, assuming you have the
money, we can reach an agreement.

01:21:41.667 --> 01:21:44.070
Or you just shot
while trying to escape.

01:21:44.678 --> 01:21:47.158
But you've never fired
nobody does it?

01:21:47.359 --> 01:21:48.760
Have not I done?

01:21:48.761 --> 01:21:51.992
It depends on you. My detectives
will fall at any minute.

01:22:17.081 --> 01:22:21.691
The costumes are elaborate.
This will be useful at the border.

01:22:24.986 --> 01:22:26.146
Thank you.

01:22:26.525 --> 01:22:31.822
No need to thank me, John.
You did everything very entertaining.

01:22:33.123 --> 01:22:34.420
Bon voyage.

01:23:39.805 --> 01:23:41.552
Beware!

01:24:02.648 --> 01:24:04.546
I've been thinking
John Taylor.

01:24:05.847 --> 01:24:08.171
Oh yeah?
What about him?

01:24:08.272 --> 01:24:13.628
In the parking lot ...
I was surprised that got away.

01:24:14.129 --> 01:24:17.127
Yeah, well. I guess
I'm getting old.

01:24:18.092 --> 01:24:20.179
I wonder where it went.

01:24:20.791 --> 01:24:23.699
It's been a couple of months, you should
have crossed the country.

01:24:26.163 --> 01:24:27.986
Or left the country.

01:24:28.087 --> 01:24:29.237
Could be.

01:24:30.060 --> 01:24:33.821
Do not feel bad about it,
Taylor is worse out there.

01:24:34.541 --> 01:24:37.512
And it is to be held on trial
Simone De Marchi, right?

01:24:38.198 --> 01:24:39.938
You did a good job there.

01:24:41.542 --> 01:24:44.650
- Never met him before, right?
- A Taylor?

01:24:44.651 --> 01:24:45.751
No.

01:24:45.752 --> 01:24:46.902
Never?

01:24:47.709 --> 01:24:49.590
Of course not,
Why?

01:24:49.591 --> 01:24:54.199
I thought maybe I would have
crusader, he has previous convictions,

01:24:54.803 --> 01:24:56.842
maybe you met him at the station.

01:24:58.123 --> 01:25:00.561
And I never met him socially,
Right?

01:25:02.118 --> 01:25:05.337
He is not exactly
My circle detective.

01:25:05.638 --> 01:25:06.973
So ...

01:25:10.586 --> 01:25:12.544
This may be shocking.

01:25:18.015 --> 01:25:19.707
My God.

01:25:22.370 --> 01:25:26.030
It's disturbing, right?

01:25:27.931 --> 01:25:30.220
I think technology
is getting out of control.

01:25:30.221 --> 01:25:32.495
- What?
- If someone like Taylor ...

01:25:32.496 --> 01:25:34.566
can do something as professional
like this ...

01:25:34.567 --> 01:25:37.538
Wait. Are you suggesting
Taylor produced this?

01:25:37.805 --> 01:25:38.811
Sure.

01:25:38.812 --> 01:25:43.932
It is a Polaroid. An exhibition
positive, not an invention in Photoshop.

01:25:43.933 --> 01:25:46.355
It must be, what other explanation
would?

01:25:46.456 --> 01:25:48.509
Besides the obvious?

01:25:48.904 --> 01:25:52.020
Ben, I know for how much,
10.

01:25:52.548 --> 01:25:54.249
- Six.
- Six years.

01:25:54.441 --> 01:25:57.409
Do you really think that I associate
with this man?

01:25:58.680 --> 01:25:59.992
I can not ignore.

01:26:01.581 --> 01:26:04.255
Sorry, Warwick, I send
to analyze that.

01:26:04.256 --> 01:26:08.041
Good. I wonder also
how they did it.

01:26:10.689 --> 01:26:13.057
- The other thing is ...
- Yes.

01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:19.095
One witness testified that Taylor
tried to enter his house after the robbery.

01:26:19.521 --> 01:26:25.231
He said he saw him again in the
morning, outside the house of his neighbor.

01:26:25.869 --> 01:26:27.366
It's your house.

01:26:32.607 --> 01:26:34.511
Is the lady who lives next to me?

01:26:34.723 --> 01:26:35.850
Yes.

01:26:36.131 --> 01:26:41.330
Morton, you know how many times called
woman to the station?

01:26:41.952 --> 01:26:43.840
the woman is insane.

01:26:44.523 --> 01:26:46.647
Yes. I know it.

01:26:47.082 --> 01:26:51.275
That's why we never took
seriously. Until now.

01:26:52.322 --> 01:26:54.055
It seems taken at home.

01:26:55.258 --> 01:26:58.532
It is a white sofa.

01:26:59.266 --> 01:27:04.214
Why you? If false, why
put you in the picture?

01:27:04.385 --> 01:27:05.796
He mocks us.

01:27:06.246 --> 01:27:07.820
Where did your picture?

01:27:08.047 --> 01:27:11.294
Newspapers, Christmas party
last year.

01:27:12.214 --> 01:27:15.574
You are who showed me his record
and resources do you?

01:27:16.821 --> 01:27:19.416
Tomorrow will probably be a
Polaroid of you and him,

01:27:19.417 --> 01:27:21.512
sitting together in a
fucking bathtub.

01:27:26.162 --> 01:27:27.305
Yes.

01:27:32.384 --> 01:27:33.593
Except ...

01:27:37.711 --> 01:27:39.553
Except that, Ben.

01:27:39.554 --> 01:27:42.704
Would be failing in the rules
if you do not investigate this.

01:27:43.567 --> 01:27:46.273
And you should.
You're a good detective.

01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:48.875
Now excuse me.

01:27:51.472 --> 01:27:53.724
I need to look
your home.

01:27:59.647 --> 01:28:01.166
All right.

01:28:01.488 --> 01:28:02.861
Okay, fine.

01:28:06.073 --> 01:28:07.212
You know,

01:28:07.513 --> 01:28:12.228
Ben, I appreciate your responsibility,
must have been hard to come talk to me,

01:28:12.229 --> 01:28:15.514
but what actually sent
a group of police to my house?

01:28:16.918 --> 01:28:19.653
- Ignoring it is not the solution.
- I agree.

01:28:20.189 --> 01:28:21.426
So.

01:28:21.938 --> 01:28:24.146
What you have in mind?

01:28:25.337 --> 01:28:27.143
How about dinner?

01:28:29.090 --> 01:28:30.172
When?

01:28:30.173 --> 01:28:34.554
Come tonight. Now I have friends
to come, I cook.

01:28:34.822 --> 01:28:37.711
It will be fun. You
comb the entire place.

01:28:38.619 --> 01:28:40.978
Now I have something in mind something
official.

01:28:41.468 --> 01:28:44.274
I'm being polite, Ben.
I have not to be.

01:28:45.625 --> 01:28:47.807
I would like to maintain our friendship.

01:28:49.269 --> 01:28:50.555
Agreed.

01:28:50.756 --> 01:28:52.605
- Dinner sounds good.
- Very good.

01:28:53.226 --> 01:28:55.171
- At 8 o'clock?
- Sure.

01:28:59.792 --> 01:29:01.193
Oh and Ben,

01:29:02.122 --> 01:29:03.764
Do you drink red wine or white?

01:29:04.850 --> 01:29:06.335
Oh, red.
