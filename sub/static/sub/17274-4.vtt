Covert Affairs..

00:02.586 --> 00:03.996
- Hi.
- Hey.

00:03.997 --> 00:05.381
Sorry to stop by like this.

00:05.415 --> 00:08.651
I'm missing one more signature
for your statement.

00:09.184 --> 00:11.559
Your vital signs
are very erratic, señorita.

00:11.560 --> 00:13.861
I have a heart condition--
myocarditis.

00:13.896 --> 00:15.176
You want to tell me
what happened

00:15.197 --> 00:16.447
the last four months?
Auggie.

00:16.481 --> 00:17.615
If there's something
you want to tell me,

00:17.649 --> 00:18.900
now's the time.

00:18.934 --> 00:20.535
You could stay a little longer
if you'd like.

00:20.569 --> 00:22.870
I would love to,
but I got to get going.

00:22.905 --> 00:25.790
Tell me what I need to know,
and I will help Oksana.

00:25.824 --> 00:26.941
Who planned the attack
in Chicago?

00:26.959 --> 00:30.461
I only knew him
as the Postman.

00:30.495 --> 00:32.162
We've got nothing
in our database,

00:32.214 --> 00:34.334
but I know a guy off campus
who might be able to help.

00:34.383 --> 00:36.000
His name is Roger Bennett.
He's former CIA.

00:36.051 --> 00:37.718
So you lied to a dying man.

00:37.753 --> 00:39.253
That's a pretty dark move,
Walker.

00:39.287 --> 00:42.139
- I did what needed to be done.
- That wasn't a criticism.

00:42.174 --> 00:44.892
That was a compliment.

01:18.594 --> 01:20.127
- How big is that thing?
- Oh, don't worry.

01:20.161 --> 01:22.129
It's all bark.

01:22.163 --> 01:24.164
Roger, this is Annie.

01:24.182 --> 01:25.933
Annie, Roger.

01:25.968 --> 01:27.334
I didn't know
what kind you liked,

01:27.352 --> 01:28.603
so we got a mix.

01:28.637 --> 01:30.471
What part of "come alone"
did you not comprehend?

01:30.505 --> 01:32.306
I know,
but you can trust her.

01:32.340 --> 01:34.191
- How can I be sure?
- Because I do.

01:42.951 --> 01:45.903
Told you.

01:49.207 --> 01:50.875
What the hell did you get me
involved in?

01:50.909 --> 01:52.576
Did you find out something
on the Postman?

01:52.628 --> 01:54.268
I know who he is,
if that's what you mean.

01:54.296 --> 01:57.832
That's what I mean.
Give us a name.

01:57.866 --> 01:59.133
Harris Wilson.

01:59.467 --> 02:01.352
He's an American citizen?

02:01.386 --> 02:03.053
Wilson is
a senior-level analyst

02:03.104 --> 02:04.688
with
the National Security Agency.

02:04.723 --> 02:07.725
Your postman is NSA.

02:10.195 --> 02:11.395
How'd you get this?

02:11.446 --> 02:12.947
He's taking
some big risks right now

02:12.981 --> 02:15.532
to sell sensitive U.S. secrets,
and he's not done.

02:15.567 --> 02:18.018
My sources tell me he's trying
to unload more quickly.

02:18.036 --> 02:20.036
Did you back-channel
this intel through Fort Meade?

02:20.038 --> 02:21.119
Yeah. Yeah, Auggie.

02:21.122 --> 02:22.740
I marched right
into the black box

02:22.791 --> 02:24.708
and asked the admiral himself.

02:24.743 --> 02:27.077
"Is one of your employees
selling CIA intel?"

02:28.496 --> 02:30.297
I've taken enough risks
as it is.

02:30.332 --> 02:32.216
You're gonna be protected
as one of our sources.

02:32.250 --> 02:34.718
And what about my sources?

02:34.753 --> 02:37.421
You've got no clue
what you're up against.

02:37.472 --> 02:39.506
Roger, you sound
a little paranoid.

02:39.540 --> 02:41.175
I'm always paranoid.

02:41.209 --> 02:42.977
And you should be too.

02:43.011 --> 02:45.131
Wilson did time with the special
collections services.

02:45.146 --> 02:48.098
That's NSA black-bag shit.

02:50.435 --> 02:53.570
Start chasing him,
he'll come after you.

02:58.076 --> 02:59.860
Okay, let's unpack this
a bit.

02:59.894 --> 03:01.862
You feel you've found
the person

03:01.896 --> 03:04.581
who leaked the existence
of the Chicago facility

03:04.616 --> 03:05.866
to Borz Altan.

03:05.900 --> 03:06.787
Harris Wilson.

03:06.811 --> 03:08.896
He's NSA,
Upper level management.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.189
He's in charge
of the Midwest trunk.

03:10.190 --> 03:13.007
Gives him access
to a dozen CIA facilities.

03:13.041 --> 03:15.409
We have to grab him
before he leaks anything else.

03:15.427 --> 03:16.960
"Grab him"?

03:17.012 --> 03:19.630
He's an officer for
a sister intelligence agency.

03:19.681 --> 03:21.081
It's not so simple.

03:21.099 --> 03:23.017
And he's clean--

03:23.051 --> 03:24.084
no red flags,

03:24.102 --> 03:26.637
no strange deposits
or withdrawals.

03:26.688 --> 03:28.105
Roger's intel tells
a different story.

03:28.139 --> 03:30.274
Well, Roger's
our only source on this,

03:30.308 --> 03:31.892
and we don't know
who his sources are.

03:31.926 --> 03:34.978
I'm friendly with Wilson's
supervisor, Don Rixton.

03:35.030 --> 03:37.481
Rixton tells me that Wilson
is a boy scout.

03:37.532 --> 03:38.615
It's not gonna be obvious.

03:38.650 --> 03:40.767
Wilson is trained
to keep secrets.

03:40.785 --> 03:44.238
Roger said he's trying
to move more intel soon.

03:45.874 --> 03:47.291
Let's get a surveillance
up and running.

03:47.325 --> 03:49.326
- I'll take the first shift.
- Keep me posted.

03:49.377 --> 03:50.627
Burgers and binoculars,

03:50.662 --> 03:52.546
some old-fashioned spy stuff--
what do you say?

03:52.580 --> 03:53.664
I was supposed to go

03:53.715 --> 03:55.132
to the Initiative
for National Progress

03:55.166 --> 03:56.967
Awards dinner tonight,
but I'll get out of it.

03:57.001 --> 03:58.302
That's
a tough beltway ticket.

03:58.336 --> 04:00.054
How'd you manage that?
I'm a plus-one.

04:00.088 --> 04:02.339
- A plus-one?
- Hayley Price.

04:02.390 --> 04:04.174
She's n--
NCTC. I know. I got word.

04:04.225 --> 04:05.959
She wants to talk to me
about Chicago.

04:05.977 --> 04:07.961
Yeah, well, I talked to her
while you were in Venezuela.

04:07.979 --> 04:09.563
She's good.

04:09.597 --> 04:11.965
Well, you should go.

04:11.983 --> 04:14.401
I don't want to raise red flags
with any of the other agencies.

04:14.436 --> 04:15.986
All right, you sure you're
gonna be okay on your own?

04:16.019 --> 04:17.321
Absolutely.

04:17.355 --> 04:21.075
If anything happens,
you will be the first to know.

04:21.108 --> 04:22.993
Hey, Joan.

04:23.027 --> 04:24.611
I need you at
the INP Awards dinner tonight.

04:24.645 --> 04:27.030
They're giving Senator Pierson
a lifetime achievement award.

04:27.082 --> 04:28.665
Annie and Auggie just
brought me compelling intel

04:28.700 --> 04:30.817
about who may have leaked
the Chicago facility.

04:30.835 --> 04:32.503
I need to monitor that Op.

04:32.537 --> 04:34.154
Monitor it from the event.
I need you there.

04:34.172 --> 04:36.757
All due respect...

04:36.791 --> 04:39.159
there's a chance more
sensitive material's at play.

04:39.177 --> 04:42.096
I get that,
but Pierson's considering

04:42.130 --> 04:44.848
outsourcing operations
for all our domestic facilities.

04:44.883 --> 04:46.216
To whom?

04:46.267 --> 04:47.718
My source tells me
it's Westbridge Consulting.

04:47.769 --> 04:49.219
They've got a meeting set
for tomorrow morning.

04:49.270 --> 04:50.854
After Chicago,
we all need to be rowing

04:50.889 --> 04:51.889
in the same direction.

04:51.940 --> 04:53.357
Good. So get your oar
in the water.

04:53.391 --> 04:56.393
I'll see you tonight.

05:09.874 --> 05:11.208
Hello, Mr. McQuaid.

05:11.242 --> 05:13.577
Did you get my gift?

05:13.628 --> 05:15.746
It's not every day
a man gives me a gun.

05:15.797 --> 05:17.464
Guns or roses--
I hope I made the right choice,

05:17.499 --> 05:19.416
and may you never have
to use it.

05:19.467 --> 05:20.918
I better stay away
from you, then.

05:20.969 --> 05:22.202
Well, that's actually
why I'm calling.

05:22.220 --> 05:24.704
Seeing we had such
a wild time in Venezuela,

05:24.722 --> 05:26.723
I was thinking
maybe we should do something

05:26.758 --> 05:28.542
a little more urbane.
What's that?

05:28.560 --> 05:30.210
I was hoping
that you would accompany me

05:30.228 --> 05:32.563
to an awards dinner tonight.

05:32.597 --> 05:33.764
I can't.

05:33.815 --> 05:36.066
Well, is that because
you still don't trust me

05:36.100 --> 05:37.818
or because you don't have
anything nice to wear?

05:37.852 --> 05:39.570
You still haven't told me
about the hour

05:39.604 --> 05:41.738
you spent with Borz Altan
in Maracaibo.

05:41.773 --> 05:42.990
Is that a no?

05:43.024 --> 05:44.858
I can't believe
you're inviting me

05:44.892 --> 05:47.327
to a black-tie dinner night of.
I didn't even know

05:47.362 --> 05:48.779
I was gonna be in D.C.
until a few hours ago.

05:48.830 --> 05:50.113
And obviously
it's last minute,

05:50.165 --> 05:51.698
but I couldn't pass up
the chance to see you.

05:51.732 --> 05:54.751
And I do want to see you.

05:54.786 --> 05:59.540
- I'm working.
- What are you working on?

05:59.574 --> 06:03.427
Thanks for the gun.

07:25.009 --> 07:26.510
L-ladies' room?

07:26.544 --> 07:29.546
It's downstairs.

Hello, ma'am,
can you hear me?

09:25.803 --> 09:27.020
Can you hear me, miss?

09:27.054 --> 09:28.471
Hello?
Ma'am, ma'am.

09:28.505 --> 09:30.557
Can you hear me?

09:39.233 --> 09:41.517
Do you know who you are?

09:41.535 --> 09:44.320
Do you know
where you're at?

09:44.354 --> 09:46.122
Annie Walker.

09:46.156 --> 09:48.049
Yeah, you're actually
in the hospital right now, okay?

09:48.050 --> 09:49.383
The doctor's gonna be
in shortly.

09:49.418 --> 09:52.720
You're gonna be fine.

09:58.043 --> 09:59.226
Limo's here.

09:59.261 --> 10:01.178
I'm ready.

10:01.212 --> 10:03.347
You know, I've never been
to a black-tie event

10:03.381 --> 10:04.732
on a first date before.

10:04.766 --> 10:07.068
How is this a first date?

10:07.102 --> 10:09.987
Oh, Auggie,
those weren't dates.

10:10.022 --> 10:11.405
Oh, that's right.

10:12.774 --> 10:15.493
Incoming call--office.
Incoming call--office.

10:15.527 --> 10:17.445
Yeah.

10:17.496 --> 10:18.746
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:18.780 --> 10:21.365
Slow down, slow down.

10:23.452 --> 10:26.370
I'll be right there.

10:34.096 --> 10:36.631
Look at us--two new parents
out on the town.

10:36.682 --> 10:38.049
Who says we can't have it all?

10:38.083 --> 10:40.184
I'd hardly call
a rubber chicken dinner

10:40.218 --> 10:41.302
a night on the town.

10:41.353 --> 10:42.436
What's the matter?

10:42.471 --> 10:44.221
You usually enjoy events
like this.

10:44.255 --> 10:45.923
I've got a lot on my mind.

10:45.941 --> 10:48.809
You need a wingman
for Pierson?

10:48.860 --> 10:50.561
You know I think
you're the most charming man

10:50.595 --> 10:51.779
in the world,

10:51.813 --> 10:53.481
but Pierson doesn't like
to feel ganged up on.

10:53.532 --> 10:56.484
I think it's best
if I approach her alone.

10:56.535 --> 10:59.436
Besides...
You have a new job.

10:59.454 --> 11:01.438
You should let McQuaid
see you in action.

11:01.456 --> 11:03.124
Our first night out
since Mack was born,

11:03.158 --> 11:05.609
and we're spending it apart--
what a waste of a good sitter.

11:07.045 --> 11:11.499
I'll be sure to save you
a dance.

11:11.550 --> 11:12.616
Until then.

11:12.634 --> 11:14.885
Until then.

11:14.920 --> 11:18.172
- Senator Kelly.
- Mr. Michaels.

11:18.223 --> 11:19.623
How have you been managing?

11:19.641 --> 11:21.175
Well, we've been drilling
down on all facets

11:21.226 --> 11:22.843
related
to the Chicago attack,

11:22.894 --> 11:25.479
and we're closer than ever
to finding our culprit.

11:25.514 --> 11:26.597
I can't get into details,

11:26.631 --> 11:28.232
but we have
a current operation

11:28.266 --> 11:30.067
that's gonna yield
concrete results.

11:30.102 --> 11:31.902
Committee is
not in session, Mr. Michaels.

11:31.937 --> 11:33.154
You don't have to spin.

11:33.188 --> 11:34.271
I'm not spinning, Senator.

11:34.305 --> 11:36.807
I'm dedicated
to the task at hand.

11:36.825 --> 11:39.243
Perhaps we got off
on the wrong foot.

11:39.277 --> 11:40.494
Call my office tomorrow,

11:40.529 --> 11:43.330
let's schedule a time for us
to talk shop.

11:46.585 --> 11:48.502
Oh, I'm sorry.
Excuse me?

11:48.537 --> 11:50.154
Let's find time
to get lunch.

11:50.172 --> 11:51.706
Absolutely.

11:51.757 --> 11:54.491
Thank you, Senator.

12:00.215 --> 12:02.717
You're lucky to have escaped
without any serious injury--

12:02.768 --> 12:04.518
only a mild concussion,

12:04.553 --> 12:06.003
but under the circumstances,

12:06.021 --> 12:08.723
I recommend you stay overnight
as a precaution.

12:08.774 --> 12:10.107
If it's only
a mild concussion,

12:10.142 --> 12:12.059
I think I'll check myself out.

12:12.110 --> 12:14.729
I wasn't referring
to the car accident.

12:14.780 --> 12:16.313
Your EKG looks
a little erratic,

12:16.347 --> 12:19.400
and the blood test revealed
traces of nitrate medication.

12:19.451 --> 12:21.402
Do you have a heart condition?

12:21.453 --> 12:23.788
There wasn't any record of it
in your file.

12:23.822 --> 12:26.457
Heart condition?
Not that I know of.

12:26.491 --> 12:29.193
Maybe there was a mistake
in your labs.

12:29.211 --> 12:31.829
No.

12:31.863 --> 12:33.464
Are you taking
any other medications

12:33.498 --> 12:34.665
I should be aware of?

12:34.699 --> 12:36.333
No.

12:36.367 --> 12:38.535
You don't want to get into
this because I'm not your G.P.,

12:38.553 --> 12:40.137
I get it.

12:40.172 --> 12:41.806
But a heart condition
isn't something to ignore.

12:41.840 --> 12:43.724
You need to take it easy.

12:43.759 --> 12:44.925
Now's not a good time.

12:44.976 --> 12:47.344
Whatever it is you have to do,
it can wait.

12:47.378 --> 12:49.597
Your health should always be
your first priority.

12:49.648 --> 12:53.067
I appreciate your concern.

12:53.101 --> 12:56.654
Outtake's down the hall.

13:01.076 --> 13:02.993
Annie?

13:04.746 --> 13:06.497
Auggie, you didn't have
to come all the way down here.

13:06.531 --> 13:07.782
Thank you.

13:07.833 --> 13:10.034
You really think I'm gonna go
to a party

13:10.068 --> 13:11.252
when you're in the hospital?

13:11.286 --> 13:12.753
Come on.

13:12.788 --> 13:14.922
- How did you know I was here?
- I'm your handler.

13:14.956 --> 13:16.590
I get notified
in situations like this.

13:16.625 --> 13:18.092
You know that.

13:18.126 --> 13:20.294
Are sure you're okay?

13:20.345 --> 13:21.796
Yeah.
Does Langley knows I'm here?

13:21.847 --> 13:23.747
What did I just say?

13:23.765 --> 13:25.432
You have a concussion
or something?

13:25.467 --> 13:28.803
No.
Yeah, uh, it's a mild one.

13:28.854 --> 13:30.254
What about my medical records?

13:30.272 --> 13:32.022
Langley in-house services
will take care of it

13:32.057 --> 13:33.190
in the morning.

13:33.225 --> 13:35.759
Don't worry.

13:35.777 --> 13:37.311
Okay, I got to get
out of here.

13:37.362 --> 13:40.097
Hey, will you relax?
You were just in a car crash.

13:40.115 --> 13:42.199
I need to find
a rental-car place.

13:42.234 --> 13:43.651
Mine's totaled.

13:43.702 --> 13:45.452
We will get you
something tomorrow.

13:45.487 --> 13:47.738
Right now
you need to go home.

13:47.772 --> 13:50.457
I followed Wilson to
a psychiatrist's office earlier.

13:50.492 --> 13:51.992
Okay.

13:52.043 --> 13:53.577
I'm want to break in,
get the doctor's notes,

13:53.611 --> 13:55.612
and see if there's anything
I can leverage against Wilson

13:55.630 --> 13:57.331
before he makes another play.

13:57.382 --> 13:59.283
No, I'll let Hollman know.

13:59.301 --> 14:00.784
We will put a team together

14:00.802 --> 14:02.303
and be on it
as soon as possible.

14:02.337 --> 14:04.755
No, I'm gonna do it tonight.
I know how and where.

14:04.789 --> 14:06.090
- What's going on with you?
- Nothing.

14:06.124 --> 14:09.626
No, stop.

14:09.644 --> 14:12.646
You're hiding something.

14:15.183 --> 14:16.934
I don't want to drag you
into this.

14:16.968 --> 14:19.520
Drag me into what?

14:23.074 --> 14:26.026
You have been hiding something
ever since you got back.

14:26.077 --> 14:28.779
Now, I want the truth.

14:32.825 --> 14:34.504
When I in Fatu Hiva,

14:34.505 --> 14:37.223
taking some time
on the beach...

14:37.274 --> 14:39.059
I went for a run.
It was no big deal.

14:39.110 --> 14:41.344
I've done it a thousand times.

14:41.362 --> 14:44.364
I--
So what happened?

14:47.167 --> 14:50.653
I felt something
in my chest.

14:50.671 --> 14:52.488
I thought I was just
out of breath.

14:52.506 --> 14:54.207
I mean, there's not a lot
of time for fitness

14:54.258 --> 14:57.326
when you're on the run.

14:57.344 --> 15:00.263
But something wasn't right.

15:03.166 --> 15:05.134
It hurt.

15:05.168 --> 15:07.186
And it went deeper
with each breath.

15:07.221 --> 15:09.672
Every heartbeat was
like a knife.

15:09.690 --> 15:11.224
I couldn't breathe.

15:13.777 --> 15:15.778
I collapsed.

15:20.651 --> 15:24.454
I could have died right there,
staring at the sky.

15:26.240 --> 15:29.909
I was lucky.

15:29.960 --> 15:32.879
- What had happened to you?
- I don't know.

15:32.913 --> 15:34.297
I was afraid to know.

15:34.331 --> 15:37.667
I mean, I was afraid
of what it would mean for me.

15:40.504 --> 15:41.754
What do you mean?

15:41.805 --> 15:43.706
The only thing
I still have left

15:43.724 --> 15:45.875
is my life as an operative.

15:45.893 --> 15:48.644
I can't lose that too.

15:52.015 --> 15:56.269
I had to get help
far from the CIA.

15:58.322 --> 16:00.022
So you went to Eyal.

16:00.056 --> 16:03.075
Yeah. Yeah.

16:13.253 --> 16:15.204
Hmm.

16:15.238 --> 16:17.707
Can you believe my mother
wanted to throw out

16:17.741 --> 16:19.675
my old med-school kit?

16:19.710 --> 16:21.711
Said I'd never put
my medical skills to use.

16:21.745 --> 16:22.929
If she could see me now.

16:22.963 --> 16:24.881
You cannot tell your mother
about this.

16:24.915 --> 16:26.799
Of course not, neshama.

16:26.850 --> 16:28.968
So that scar on your chest--

16:29.019 --> 16:31.253
is that
from that Russian double?

16:31.271 --> 16:33.723
Yeah.

16:33.757 --> 16:35.858
What do you think it is?

16:35.893 --> 16:38.361
I don't know exactly,

16:38.395 --> 16:40.813
but I know enough to know
it's serious.

16:40.864 --> 16:43.866
I'd like to bring in
a cardiologist.

16:43.901 --> 16:45.368
A cardiologist?

16:45.402 --> 16:47.436
Yes, my friend Avram.

16:47.454 --> 16:50.289
He did much better than
I did at Haifa.

16:50.324 --> 16:52.792
Don't worry.
He's trustworthy.

16:52.826 --> 16:55.294
Your secret is safe, neshama.

16:58.966 --> 17:00.416
I had the full panel.

17:00.450 --> 17:01.584
He kept it discreet--

17:01.618 --> 17:06.255
no names, no forms,
no questions.

17:30.330 --> 17:31.831
Myocarditis?

17:31.865 --> 17:34.500
It's an infection
of the cardiac muscle tissue.

17:34.535 --> 17:35.751
No, I know what it is.

17:35.786 --> 17:37.954
So I was correct
about the scar tissue.

17:37.988 --> 17:39.455
It's spread
to my mitral valve,

17:39.489 --> 17:43.626
but Avram says it can be managed
with nitrate injections.

17:43.660 --> 17:45.294
Well, what about surgery?

17:45.328 --> 17:47.496
We have all the best surgeons
here in Israel.

17:47.514 --> 17:51.350
Surgery comes
with its own set of risks.

17:54.054 --> 17:56.556
You know what I think?

17:56.607 --> 17:58.941
I think this is a gift.

17:58.976 --> 18:01.010
I think this is your way out.

18:01.028 --> 18:02.862
How can you say that
with a straight face?

18:02.896 --> 18:05.180
Every spy always talks
about getting out

18:05.198 --> 18:06.532
before it's too late.

18:06.567 --> 18:08.067
No one ever does.

18:08.118 --> 18:09.702
Where would I go?

18:09.736 --> 18:11.821
Anywhere you like--

18:11.855 --> 18:14.073
a mountaintop, the beach.

18:14.124 --> 18:16.325
You can use my boat if you want.
Stay here in my house.

18:16.359 --> 18:20.379
The point is, get out
before it's too late.

18:20.414 --> 18:21.631
The last time you quit,

18:21.665 --> 18:24.383
how long
did you stay away for?

18:24.418 --> 18:26.252
I don't have
a heart condition.

18:26.303 --> 18:28.203
It can be managed.

18:28.221 --> 18:31.057
So you're gonna keep this
hidden from your agency?

18:31.091 --> 18:33.392
For how long?

18:33.427 --> 18:34.844
The Talmud teaches us--

18:34.878 --> 18:36.095
The Talmud? Really?

18:36.146 --> 18:39.048
This is life or death,
neshama.

18:39.066 --> 18:41.984
I'm bringing out the big guns.

18:42.019 --> 18:43.385
Now, the Talmud tells us

18:43.403 --> 18:45.387
that for the sake of peace,
one may lie,

18:45.405 --> 18:48.491
but peace itself
should never be a lie.

18:48.525 --> 18:51.077
If you conceal this, it'll just
eat you up from inside.

18:51.111 --> 18:54.997
You'll never find
what you're looking for.

18:55.032 --> 18:57.700
Being a spy

18:57.734 --> 19:00.870
is all that matters to me.

19:00.904 --> 19:03.372
I don't believe that
for a second.

19:03.406 --> 19:04.874
You care deeply
about too many people

19:04.908 --> 19:06.375
for that to be true.

19:06.409 --> 19:08.844
But being in the field
is who I am.

19:11.098 --> 19:14.884
That's one of the saddest
things I've ever heard.

19:14.918 --> 19:18.688
You gonna drink this
with me or what?

19:21.358 --> 19:22.775
To getting out.

19:28.365 --> 19:30.700
You realize this makes you
a weaker spy.

19:30.734 --> 19:32.318
I have the injections.

19:32.369 --> 19:35.821
No, not your heart,
your secret.

19:35.872 --> 19:37.039
You have a button now,

19:37.074 --> 19:38.958
something to be leveraged.

19:43.780 --> 19:45.164
I trust you.

19:45.215 --> 19:47.166
And you trust Avram.

19:47.217 --> 19:50.052
Secrets have a way
of getting out.

19:50.087 --> 19:51.504
And what then?

19:51.555 --> 19:56.092
You think getting booted
is the worst possible option?

19:56.126 --> 19:59.178
You got to be careful, neshama.

20:05.068 --> 20:07.302
I owe you one.

20:07.320 --> 20:11.657
I know I say that a lot,
but I owe you one.

20:25.505 --> 20:27.289
Annie,
you could've told me.

20:27.323 --> 20:28.874
I might have been able
to help.

20:28.925 --> 20:30.292
I didn't want
to compromise you.

20:30.326 --> 20:32.211
As my handler,
you're obligated

20:32.262 --> 20:33.996
to report
my medical condition.

20:34.014 --> 20:35.765
And I know you.

20:35.799 --> 20:39.051
You will do anything
to protect me,

20:39.102 --> 20:41.971
but look at it
from my position.

20:42.005 --> 20:44.640
I mean, what would you do
to be back in the field again?

20:44.674 --> 20:46.475
Anything.

20:46.509 --> 20:50.362
But not telling the agency
doesn't solve the problem.

20:50.397 --> 20:53.149
They won't let me continue
to be an operative.

20:53.183 --> 20:55.201
Will you stop thinking
about work for a second?

20:55.235 --> 20:59.622
This is your life.

20:59.656 --> 21:01.690
It's not gonna matter, anyway,
come tomorrow.

21:01.708 --> 21:04.693
Why?

21:04.711 --> 21:07.413
The doctor took a blood sample
after the crash.

21:07.464 --> 21:09.531
And as soon as Langley reviews
my records,

21:09.549 --> 21:11.417
they will pull me
from active field duty.

21:11.468 --> 21:12.918
And you want to go out
with a win.

21:12.969 --> 21:15.087
I want to do my job

21:15.138 --> 21:17.506
until they take it
away from me.

22:34.251 --> 22:36.302
How many of those
you still have to go through?

22:36.336 --> 22:38.054
- A lot.
- Any of them in braille?

22:38.088 --> 22:39.622
I'd be happy to take
some of the load.

22:39.640 --> 22:42.675
It's okay.
I got it.

22:42.726 --> 22:46.929
You mind
if I put on some music?

22:46.963 --> 22:49.432
Hold on.

22:49.466 --> 22:51.601
He had an affair.

22:51.635 --> 22:54.520
Makes him a cheater,
not necessarily a traitor.

22:54.571 --> 22:59.108
It means he has a secret
that we can leverage.

22:59.142 --> 23:01.811
True.
Where we off to?

23:01.829 --> 23:03.746
To convince Joan.

23:03.781 --> 23:05.998
Good thing you're still
wearing your tuxedo.

23:07.818 --> 23:10.002
And it is with great honor

23:10.037 --> 23:12.205
that on behalf of the INP,

23:12.256 --> 23:15.174
I present this award
to my friend

23:15.209 --> 23:17.993
Senator Claire Pierson.

23:21.765 --> 23:24.467
Thank you.
Thank you so very, very much.

23:24.501 --> 23:26.936
And thank you, Doug.

23:26.970 --> 23:29.555
I'm very pleased to cross
the aisle

23:29.606 --> 23:30.973
to accept this award.

23:32.843 --> 23:35.027
What are you doing here?

23:35.062 --> 23:37.029
Enjoying the party.

23:37.064 --> 23:38.281
Yourself?

23:38.315 --> 23:39.398
Not so much.

23:39.449 --> 23:42.401
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

23:44.988 --> 23:47.156
I appreciate it very much.

23:50.994 --> 23:53.629
You look beautiful.

23:53.664 --> 23:55.464
- Integrity...
- I know.

23:55.499 --> 23:57.216
And moral responsibility...

23:57.251 --> 24:01.971
Are the backbone
of this country.

24:02.005 --> 24:05.057
Now, more than ever,
the work of Congress

24:05.092 --> 24:07.977
is vigilant oversight.

24:08.011 --> 24:11.681
We in power owe it
to the American people

24:11.715 --> 24:16.319
to be the humble stewards
of their trust,

24:16.353 --> 24:19.822
for it is we who serve them.

24:19.857 --> 24:23.242
And let us never, ever
forget this.

24:23.277 --> 24:27.163
Thank you. Thank you humbly
for this award.

24:27.197 --> 24:29.231
And may God bless America.

24:33.403 --> 24:37.006
Lovely speech, Claire--
very inspiring.

24:37.040 --> 24:39.592
If you're here
to talk departmental budgets,

24:39.626 --> 24:41.577
you can save your breath.

24:41.595 --> 24:43.045
I know you won't let
our history

24:43.079 --> 24:44.430
influence your decision.

24:44.464 --> 24:46.081
My decisions
are based on facts,

24:46.099 --> 24:48.217
and the facts are against you.

24:48.251 --> 24:49.969
Well, here's one more fact--

24:50.020 --> 24:51.587
we're very close
to I.D.'ing the source

24:51.605 --> 24:52.922
of the Chicago leak.

24:52.940 --> 24:54.974
Oh, really?
Details?

24:55.025 --> 24:56.893
You know
I can't tell you that.

24:56.927 --> 24:59.261
Then there you have it.

24:59.279 --> 25:01.063
You know,
that's the problem with the CIA.

25:01.097 --> 25:02.765
No line items--
Are you actually-

25:02.783 --> 25:04.266
How's my rainmaker doing?

25:04.284 --> 25:05.935
You better get
your umbrella.

25:05.953 --> 25:08.103
I saw you chatting
Tim Evans up.

25:08.121 --> 25:09.989
Tim wants to give us
the Coronado training contract--

25:10.040 --> 25:11.040
no bid required.

25:11.074 --> 25:12.107
What are we looking at,
7 mil?

25:12.125 --> 25:14.877
- 12 million.
- Oh, good catch.

25:14.912 --> 25:16.913
But now I need you to set
your sights

25:16.947 --> 25:19.081
on a bigger fish.

25:19.115 --> 25:21.717
Word has it that Pierson wants
to outsource a huge chunk

25:21.752 --> 25:23.953
of Langley's intelligence
apparatus.

25:23.971 --> 25:25.888
We're talking 40 million,
50 million at least.

25:25.923 --> 25:27.473
Is this really
the best time?

25:27.507 --> 25:29.141
I know you're concerned
about undercutting your wife,

25:29.176 --> 25:30.927
but you don't have to be.

25:30.961 --> 25:33.562
Pierson has already made up
her mind about going private.

25:33.597 --> 25:35.398
I'm also referring
to Chicago.

25:35.432 --> 25:37.683
Are we here to benefit
from tragedy?

25:37.734 --> 25:40.353
The attack has proven
how vulnerable we all are.

25:40.404 --> 25:43.022
Senator Pierson is a patriot
who is losing sleep

25:43.073 --> 25:45.641
about the safety
of her country.

25:45.659 --> 25:47.243
Be her pillow.

25:51.949 --> 25:53.699
Here they are...

25:53.750 --> 25:55.418
The loveliest ladies
in the ball.

25:57.037 --> 25:58.320
Thank you, Arthur,

25:58.338 --> 26:01.156
although I'm not sure
that Joan appreciates

26:01.174 --> 26:02.291
the comparison.

26:02.325 --> 26:04.093
So your 30 seconds are up.

26:04.127 --> 26:05.461
She's all yours.

26:05.495 --> 26:07.713
I'm actually here
to see you.

26:07.764 --> 26:10.132
- Oh.
- Would you be so kind?

26:10.166 --> 26:12.885
Well, why not?

26:12.936 --> 26:15.221
You know, the answer is no.

26:15.272 --> 26:17.390
- Claire?
- Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

26:17.441 --> 26:18.841
"Senator" works.

26:18.859 --> 26:21.227
Did you really think
that some fancy footwork

26:21.278 --> 26:23.062
was gonna be enough
to sway me?

26:23.113 --> 26:24.847
Oh, just give it
till the bridge.

26:28.235 --> 26:29.819
You're already too late.

26:29.853 --> 26:32.187
Claire, we both know
McQuaid Security

26:32.205 --> 26:34.189
is best equipped to handle
this contract.

26:34.207 --> 26:36.792
Ryan McQuaid is a shark.

26:36.827 --> 26:39.662
After Chicago, a shark
is exactly what you need.

26:39.696 --> 26:41.998
- I'm risk-averse.
- As am I.

26:42.032 --> 26:44.199
And you know why
I signed on with the guy?

26:44.217 --> 26:46.302
Because he gets things done.

26:46.336 --> 26:49.005
National policy,

26:49.039 --> 26:50.639
state headlines,

26:50.674 --> 26:52.391
global access,

26:52.426 --> 26:55.711
and Pierson...

26:55.729 --> 26:58.230
For the win.

27:03.987 --> 27:05.771
I'm a tad underdressed.

27:05.822 --> 27:09.408
Don't worry. I look good
enough for the both of us.

27:11.745 --> 27:14.864
You see anybody?

27:16.249 --> 27:20.119
Uh, no sign of Calder.

27:20.170 --> 27:22.588
There's Joan.
Come on.

27:22.622 --> 27:25.007
Joan.
Annie...

27:25.042 --> 27:26.959
I was just trying to call you
to get an update.

27:27.010 --> 27:31.213
- Could we speak privately?
- Yes, of course.

27:31.247 --> 27:32.414
You need me to do what?

27:32.432 --> 27:34.467
We need you to call
your friend at the NSA

27:34.518 --> 27:36.519
and have him call Wilson
into the office.

27:36.553 --> 27:37.553
Why?

27:37.554 --> 27:39.021
To get Wilson
out of the house.

27:39.056 --> 27:40.639
Then I can talk to his wife.

27:40.690 --> 27:42.858
What are you gonna say
to his wife?

27:42.893 --> 27:44.527
He had an affair.

27:44.561 --> 27:46.729
If I can turn her,
we can use her.

27:46.763 --> 27:48.430
But we have to move now.

27:48.448 --> 27:50.900
Do you have
credible intelligence

27:50.934 --> 27:52.952
suggesting that he's gonna
make a move tonight?

27:52.986 --> 27:54.436
'Cause that's what I need.

27:54.454 --> 27:56.705
No, but I bumped
into him

27:56.740 --> 27:58.420
while I was tailing him
to his appointment,

27:58.441 --> 28:00.576
and he might have made me.

28:00.610 --> 28:01.994
This is thin.

28:02.045 --> 28:04.547
Joan, if Wilson even thinks
he's being surveilled,

28:04.581 --> 28:05.781
he's gonna lock
everything up tight.

28:05.799 --> 28:08.050
He may even move to unload
the intel sooner.

28:08.085 --> 28:11.053
He is a direct link
to whoever's behind Chicago,

28:11.088 --> 28:14.090
and this could be
our last chance.

28:17.677 --> 28:19.478
Okay, I'll make the call.

28:22.816 --> 28:25.801
Auggie...
"An hour, tops"?

28:25.819 --> 28:27.636
Hayley, I am so sorry.

28:27.654 --> 28:29.855
Work has gone much longer
than expected.

28:29.906 --> 28:31.357
I'm up to my eyeballs
in work,

28:31.408 --> 28:33.359
and I managed to make it here
on time.

28:34.611 --> 28:36.278
Hayley Price,
this is Annie Walker.

28:36.312 --> 28:38.497
Annie, Hayley.
I know who you are.

28:38.532 --> 28:40.816
We have a lot to discuss.
Right, I owe you a phone call.

28:40.834 --> 28:43.169
As soon as things calm down,
I promise to find the time.

28:43.203 --> 28:45.788
Great.
I expect a call tomorrow.

28:45.822 --> 28:47.456
It was nice
to meet you, Hayley.

28:47.490 --> 28:51.343
I'll go get the car.
Great.

28:51.378 --> 28:52.628
So what's going on?

28:52.662 --> 28:54.847
There are all these whispers
around this party

28:54.881 --> 28:57.850
that the agency is running some
sort of sensitive Op tonight.

28:57.884 --> 28:59.051
I can't say anything.

28:59.102 --> 29:00.970
I'm still on the clock,
and I really got to go.

29:01.004 --> 29:03.189
I am trying to coordinate
a response to Chicago,

29:03.223 --> 29:04.857
and you're looping me out.

29:04.891 --> 29:07.560
If this pans out,
you will be my first call,

29:07.611 --> 29:08.777
and if it doesn't,
I promise

29:08.812 --> 29:10.646
I'll spend tomorrow
making it up to you.

29:10.680 --> 29:14.984
If you can show me
where the door is...

29:15.018 --> 29:19.538
I know it's
a huge favor, Don.

29:19.573 --> 29:21.657
Thank you.

29:59.863 --> 30:01.897
- Melinda Wilson?
- Can I help you?

30:01.915 --> 30:03.699
I'm sorry to bother you
at such a late hour,

30:03.733 --> 30:05.951
but we don't have much time.

30:06.002 --> 30:07.286
Can I come in?

30:07.337 --> 30:08.954
No, no.
Who the hell are you?

30:09.005 --> 30:12.925
Uh, it's about your husband.

30:12.959 --> 30:15.094
You've got five seconds.

30:15.128 --> 30:16.762
Trust me--you don't want
to have this conversation

30:16.796 --> 30:18.464
on your front stoop.
Time's up.

30:18.515 --> 30:20.766
Your husband is really good
at keeping secrets,

30:20.800 --> 30:22.384
especially from you.

30:22.418 --> 30:25.254
How many times has he looked you
in the eye and lied?

30:25.272 --> 30:28.941
He's doing it again.

30:28.975 --> 30:30.693
Are you having an affair
with him?

30:30.727 --> 30:32.394
No.

30:32.428 --> 30:33.896
It's much bigger than that.

30:33.930 --> 30:35.397
What are you talking about?

30:35.431 --> 30:38.117
He's selling classified
secrets to terrorists.

30:38.151 --> 30:41.103
That's impossible.

30:41.121 --> 30:43.572
Where's Harris now?

30:43.606 --> 30:44.606
He's at work.

30:44.624 --> 30:46.242
It's almost midnight.

30:46.276 --> 30:48.327
Does he usually go
to the office this late?

30:48.378 --> 30:49.912
No.

30:49.946 --> 30:51.446
Because he's lying to you.

30:51.464 --> 30:53.749
He's been lying to you
all along,

30:53.783 --> 30:55.751
but you can help us stop him.

30:55.785 --> 30:58.003
Think about your family.
Are you threatening me?

30:58.054 --> 30:59.588
The only threat is
your husband.

30:59.622 --> 31:01.257
Can I come in?

31:01.291 --> 31:02.391
No, if you don't go
right now,

31:02.425 --> 31:03.792
I'm calling the cops.
Melinda-

31:03.810 --> 31:05.761
Go!

31:12.485 --> 31:13.652
It was a hail Mary.

31:13.687 --> 31:14.687
I should have been able
to turn her.

31:14.738 --> 31:16.355
No one wants to face
the truth.

31:16.406 --> 31:18.274
It feels easier to look
the other way.

31:18.308 --> 31:21.577
Then call Joan
and have Melinda brought in.

31:21.611 --> 31:23.946
I'm sorry, Annie.

31:23.980 --> 31:25.981
A couple of hours one-on-one,
I can get her--

31:25.999 --> 31:28.667
It's time to call it a night.

31:28.702 --> 31:30.152
What?
What's so funny?

31:30.170 --> 31:33.539
I'm a really good driver.

31:33.590 --> 31:36.542
Even when I was at the farm
and I didn't know anything else,

31:36.593 --> 31:37.960
I knew that.

31:37.994 --> 31:40.296
After everything
I've survived,

31:40.330 --> 31:42.331
it's a freak car accident
that kills my career.

31:42.349 --> 31:46.218
- Your career's not over.
- I want to be in the field.

31:46.269 --> 31:48.270
It's my life.
It should be my choice.

31:50.473 --> 31:54.560
The hardest decisions in life
are sometimes made for us.

31:54.611 --> 31:57.613
It's how we choose to live
with them that matters.

32:01.794 --> 32:04.896
I knew that you were good,
but that flat out masterful.

32:05.918 --> 32:07.919
Man, you're light
on your feet.

32:07.953 --> 32:09.454
Glad I could be of help.

32:09.505 --> 32:11.405
Well, you did more
than just help.

32:11.424 --> 32:13.241
That's what you hired me
to do, isn't it?

32:13.259 --> 32:14.459
To make it rain.

32:14.510 --> 32:16.294
Money's only part
of the equation.

32:16.345 --> 32:18.797
The work that we're doing
is making a difference

32:18.848 --> 32:21.266
for good.

32:21.300 --> 32:23.268
America will be safer
because of the services

32:23.302 --> 32:24.919
that we provide,

32:24.937 --> 32:26.921
especially in the wake
of Chicago.

32:26.939 --> 32:29.357
That's why you're here.

32:29.391 --> 32:31.810
Here's to keeping the lights
on for another month.

32:31.861 --> 32:34.279
$40 million just keeps
the lights on?

32:34.313 --> 32:37.431
That's just
a figure of speech.

32:37.450 --> 32:39.651
Just keep doing
what you're doing.

32:46.942 --> 32:49.461
Wilson's wife was
uncooperative.

32:49.495 --> 32:52.464
Annie and Auggie are going
to circle back in the morning.

32:55.918 --> 32:58.786
How much did you see?

32:58.804 --> 33:02.173
I saw you and a woman
exiting a coat closet.

33:02.224 --> 33:06.794
Later, I saw that same woman
on Senator Wolpert's arm.

33:06.812 --> 33:09.430
It doesn't take a spy
to connect the dots.

33:09.464 --> 33:11.483
It was a lapse in judgment.

33:11.517 --> 33:14.302
Wolpert is known
inside the beltway

33:14.320 --> 33:17.489
for his shameless
sexual proclivities

33:17.523 --> 33:18.990
with women he pays.

33:19.024 --> 33:22.243
You are not.

33:22.278 --> 33:25.580
Whatever she costs,
it's not worth it.

33:25.614 --> 33:28.616
I keep my personal life
and my business separate.

33:28.650 --> 33:32.587
This job requires us
to compartmentalize our lives.

33:32.621 --> 33:34.205
Is a coat closet one
of those compartments?

33:34.256 --> 33:36.291
You got what you got. Now, how
are you going to play it?

33:36.325 --> 33:37.658
I'm the least of your worries.

33:37.676 --> 33:40.128
If I saw you, someone else
might have seen you too.

33:40.162 --> 33:43.331
And this could ruin you.

33:43.349 --> 33:46.100
I know how hard
you worked to get this job.

33:46.135 --> 33:49.971
If you want to keep it,
you can't have secrets anymore.

33:55.194 --> 33:59.147
You're right, Joan.
Thank you.

33:59.181 --> 34:01.199
Good night.

34:04.453 --> 34:06.738
You were supposed
to save me a dance.

34:06.789 --> 34:07.855
I'm sorry.

34:07.873 --> 34:10.208
That's not how I wanted
that to go down.

34:10.242 --> 34:11.525
I assume
you got the contract.

34:11.543 --> 34:13.962
Pierson was going to sub it
out to Westbridge.

34:13.996 --> 34:15.964
- Hmm.
- It's better if it's us.

34:15.998 --> 34:17.549
You mean McQuaid?

34:17.583 --> 34:19.333
The man who still won't talk

34:19.368 --> 34:22.754
about the hour
he spent alone with the bomber?

34:22.804 --> 34:25.473
I'm gonna have to let go
of a lot of good people.

34:25.507 --> 34:26.641
And I'll hire them back

34:26.675 --> 34:28.342
for more than they were making
with the Agency.

34:28.377 --> 34:31.379
And Mack gets a bump
for his college fund.

34:31.397 --> 34:34.264
It's a win-win.

34:36.268 --> 34:38.402
Yeah.

34:38.437 --> 34:40.688
Win-win.

34:45.159 --> 34:47.745
Auggie?

34:47.780 --> 34:50.415
How'd you find my limo?
Oh, it's a long story.

34:50.449 --> 34:53.234
I called the driver.

34:53.252 --> 34:55.420
So what'd you find out
about Chicago?

34:55.454 --> 34:56.670
Well, that is why I'm here.

34:56.705 --> 35:00.425
It turns out
I stood you up for nothing.

35:00.459 --> 35:01.876
Oh, great.

35:01.910 --> 35:04.212
Well, then on the way home,
you can tell me everything

35:04.246 --> 35:06.247
you didn't learn.
I can't tell you anything.

35:06.265 --> 35:08.383
- Why not if it's nothing?
- Hayley.

35:08.417 --> 35:10.385
Why are you here?

35:10.419 --> 35:13.588
- I'm gonna make it up to you.
- It's after midnight.

35:13.622 --> 35:15.390
Which means
it's officially tomorrow,

35:15.424 --> 35:17.058
making me a man of my word.

35:17.092 --> 35:19.894
So are you some good guy
who's sometimes bad

35:19.928 --> 35:23.314
or a bad guy
who's trying to be good?

35:23.365 --> 35:25.066
Maybe a little bit of both.

35:25.100 --> 35:27.068
Yeah?

36:47.366 --> 36:48.533
How'd you find me?

36:48.567 --> 36:51.319
I'm NSA.
I know everything.

37:16.322 --> 37:18.337
Wasn't easy working around the wife.

37:18.850 --> 37:20.652
But a sweep team
discovered a laptop

37:20.686 --> 37:21.986
hidden in Wilson's basement.

37:22.020 --> 37:24.038
TECHINT was able
to pull a lead.

37:24.073 --> 37:25.957
- How solid?
- Extremely.

37:25.991 --> 37:28.526
Turns out
the Chicago security protocol

37:28.544 --> 37:30.545
wasn't the only intel
Wilson sold.

37:30.579 --> 37:32.363
Someone paid for the same specs
on a station

37:32.381 --> 37:34.716
in Dar es Salaam as well.
Did you evacuate?

37:34.750 --> 37:37.335
Yes, everyone,
this past hour--

37:37.369 --> 37:40.204
83 people in total.

37:40.222 --> 37:41.556
Dodged a bullet.

37:41.590 --> 37:43.224
Thank God.

37:43.258 --> 37:45.476
We also discovered
the money was transferred

37:45.511 --> 37:47.511
through a bank in Paris
two days before the attack.

37:48.589 --> 37:51.541
That could lead us
to who funded the bombing.

37:51.592 --> 37:54.628
This was a huge win, Annie.

37:57.632 --> 38:00.467
Now, having said that...

38:03.469 --> 38:06.805
What were you thinking?

38:09.859 --> 38:11.175
I can explain.

38:11.193 --> 38:14.112
You have a concussion.

38:14.146 --> 38:17.532
You could've blacked out
at the wrong time or worse.

38:17.566 --> 38:19.183
Not only were you putting
yourself at risk,

38:19.201 --> 38:23.154
you could have compromised
the mission.

38:23.188 --> 38:25.123
That's it--a concussion.

38:25.157 --> 38:26.708
This is not something
to gloss over.

38:26.742 --> 38:28.303
No, you're right.
It won't happen again.

38:28.327 --> 38:31.630
Good, because the DPD needs
you firing on all cylinders,

38:31.664 --> 38:33.832
now more than ever.

38:35.251 --> 38:37.201
Go home, Annie.

38:37.219 --> 38:40.722
You had one hell of a night.
Take the day off.

38:43.809 --> 38:47.545
- About last night...
- Mm, that was fun.

38:47.563 --> 38:50.899
Don't worry. I'm not going
to charge you or anything.

38:52.818 --> 38:56.488
Can you zip me up, please?

38:56.522 --> 38:59.908
You know, seeing you there
last night,

38:59.942 --> 39:04.079
I'm not used
to feeling like that.

39:04.113 --> 39:07.332
I was thinking maybe we should
go out to dinner.

39:07.366 --> 39:08.783
Don't do that.

39:08.834 --> 39:11.419
What?

39:11.454 --> 39:13.538
Get tied up.

39:13.572 --> 39:15.707
This is no-strings by design.

39:15.741 --> 39:19.928
Last night was not pretend.
I know you felt something too.

39:19.962 --> 39:21.930
You're a sweet guy, Calder.

39:21.964 --> 39:24.766
And it was hot
when you took control,

39:24.800 --> 39:27.102
but don't dare try
and control me.

39:27.136 --> 39:30.021
- Sydney--
- That's not even my real name.

39:36.562 --> 39:38.730
You should go.

39:40.449 --> 39:43.485
But call me.

39:43.536 --> 39:45.904
Okay?

39:57.616 --> 40:00.785
I saw a woman who looked
exactly like you at the gala.

40:00.803 --> 40:03.304
Clearly someone had
too much champagne last night.

40:03.339 --> 40:05.289
Breakfast?

40:05.307 --> 40:07.759
- It's noon.
- Well, lunch works for me.

40:07.793 --> 40:10.762
Maybe some other time.
I have to go and see a friend.

40:10.796 --> 40:13.431
How did the rest
of your evening turn out?

40:16.635 --> 40:18.353
Thanks for the gun.

40:18.404 --> 40:20.271
You already thanked me.

40:20.305 --> 40:22.440
Yeah, but I feel like
a little extra gratitude

40:22.474 --> 40:24.192
is deserved.

40:24.243 --> 40:25.527
Are you okay?

40:28.280 --> 40:31.699
Love what you do, and you
never work a day in your life.

40:34.036 --> 40:36.871
I'll see you around, McQuaid.

40:47.716 --> 40:50.518
Auggie?

40:50.553 --> 40:52.353
It's me.

40:52.388 --> 40:55.890
How did you do that?

40:55.941 --> 40:59.727
Oh, I've got
my own secret ways.

40:59.779 --> 41:01.529
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you had company.

41:01.564 --> 41:03.982
Hayley came by
after the event last night.

41:04.016 --> 41:06.868
- Oh.
- Yeah.

41:06.902 --> 41:11.156
Is this weird?
No. It's fine.

41:11.190 --> 41:12.523
Um...

41:12.541 --> 41:14.859
Why did you change
my medical records?

41:14.877 --> 41:17.879
Well, it's your life.

41:17.913 --> 41:21.633
No one should be deciding
how you spend it.

41:21.667 --> 41:22.967
Thank you.

41:23.002 --> 41:25.703
I appreciate your gratitude,
but I need your trust.

41:25.721 --> 41:27.505
What you're doing out
there is dangerous.

41:27.539 --> 41:30.258
It requires a handler.
You're more than my handler.

41:30.309 --> 41:33.595
Well, don't forget
that again, huh?

41:35.047 --> 41:38.149
Okay, I guess, um,
I'll see you at work.

41:38.184 --> 41:41.069
- Annie.
- Yeah?

41:41.103 --> 41:44.489
I'm glad you came clean
with me last night.

41:44.523 --> 41:47.725
I like it better when
we're honest with each other.

41:47.743 --> 41:49.994
Me too.

41:50.029 --> 41:51.029
Bye.

41:51.030 --> 41:53.198
Yeah.
