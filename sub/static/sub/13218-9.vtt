[reporter] <i>A surprising development</i>

01:19.790 --> 01:22.918
<i>This photo, leaked from inside</i>
<i>Litchfield Correctional Facility,</i>

01:26.839 --> 01:28.924
<i>-with an African-American inmate.</i>
-[Suzanne exclaims]

01:29.008 --> 01:31.927
<i>This undermines the allegations of racism</i>
<i>that have been swirling</i>

01:32.011 --> 01:36.682

-[grunting]

01:42.397 --> 01:45.733
Okay, y'all, so what y'all gonna do
with y'all cash money?

01:45.816 --> 01:46.859
[chuckling]

01:46.942 --> 01:49.529
Yo, I'm gonna take my girl
to Amsterdam.

01:49.612 --> 01:52.031
Rent a bounce house
in the shape of a frog.

01:52.115 --> 01:54.450
I'm gonna follow D'Angelo around

01:54.534 --> 01:57.203
like them white people
be following that band Phish,

01:57.287 --> 01:58.996
where they spell the word "fish" wrong.

01:59.079 --> 02:01.874
-What about you, Watson?
-[clicks tongue] Oh, you know.

02:01.957 --> 02:04.960
Probably spend most of it on rims.

02:09.382 --> 02:11.717
-[all laughing]
-[Suzanne] Jesus!

02:11.801 --> 02:13.678
[all laughing]

02:15.138 --> 02:16.597
Y'all, we ain't think this shit through.

02:16.681 --> 02:18.433
Man, stop cryin' about it already.

02:18.516 --> 02:21.519
You was so hyped about being famous and--

02:21.602 --> 02:24.980
Okay, first of all,
some brown puffs are famous.

02:25.064 --> 02:26.232
Not me.

02:26.316 --> 02:29.194
And two, how do you think
this gonna play upstairs?

02:29.277 --> 02:31.404
Are you talking about... God?

02:31.487 --> 02:33.614
[softly] I'm talkin' about Caputo.

02:33.698 --> 02:37.410
Yo, don't even worry about it, man.
We got Judy on our side.

02:37.493 --> 02:39.370
Y'all still ain't gettin' it,
are you?

02:39.454 --> 02:41.121
She used us.

02:41.206 --> 02:43.291
Now, she out there
lookin' post-racial as shit,

02:43.374 --> 02:45.335
and I'm about to get
a boot up my black ass.

02:47.670 --> 02:49.589
Lesbians...

02:49.672 --> 02:50.715
Am I right?

02:52.550 --> 02:54.051
[Piscatella] <i>What the hell is this?</i>

02:54.969 --> 02:57.096
Anyone want to fill me in?

02:57.179 --> 02:58.848
Who was on Judy King duty today?

02:58.931 --> 03:01.559
It was me,
but she told me to get lost.

03:01.642 --> 03:03.936
She said she doesn't need
a babysitter anymore.

03:04.019 --> 03:05.313
Well, I can see why.

03:05.396 --> 03:07.482
I tried to stay,
but she got really irritated,

03:07.565 --> 03:08.733
and Caputo told us
to keep her happy, so--

03:08.816 --> 03:11.694
As far as I'm concerned,
she's his problem to deal with now.

03:11.777 --> 03:14.947
But what I want to know
is how this photo got out.

03:15.865 --> 03:17.242
[chuckling] Eh.

03:17.325 --> 03:19.827
You know inmates.
Always up to something.

03:19.910 --> 03:20.995
Right.

03:22.121 --> 03:23.998
Well, guess what time it is, people.

03:24.081 --> 03:26.125
It's time for a phone sweep.

03:26.208 --> 03:29.169
Oh, no.
Sir, I don't think that'll help.

03:29.254 --> 03:32.548
You know, they'd hide their shit in, like,
places you wouldn't think to look--

03:32.632 --> 03:34.467
-Well, start thinking... and looking.
-Okay.

03:34.550 --> 03:37.762
[stuttering] You're talking about
dismantling every electrical appliance,

03:37.845 --> 03:40.265
lifting up the ceiling tiles,
and getting into the HVAC system.

03:40.348 --> 03:42.683
Snaking the drains,
tearing apart all the mattresses.

03:42.767 --> 03:44.727
[stuttering] I hear they hide
their shit in shit.

03:44.810 --> 03:46.479
Like, in the porta potties.

03:46.562 --> 03:48.147
For real.
It's nasty.

03:48.231 --> 03:51.984
Oh, sorry, I-- I didn't realize
this was going to be hard.

03:52.067 --> 03:53.986
You know what?
Instead, let's just...

03:54.069 --> 03:56.071
go over to my place
and watch <i>Bachelorette.</i>

03:57.114 --> 03:58.699
[softly] Okay.

03:58.783 --> 04:01.827
Why don't you head this one up, Luschek?

04:02.537 --> 04:04.830
Think of it as your chance to impress me.

04:05.915 --> 04:08.543
Oh, and one more thing.

04:08.626 --> 04:12.046
CO Mooney down at Max
says the SHU's almost full.

04:12.129 --> 04:14.632
There's one or two cells left.
That's it.

04:14.715 --> 04:17.927
Which means we can't be sending
people down there all willy-nilly.

04:18.010 --> 04:19.011
Pell-mell.

04:19.094 --> 04:20.721
[stuttering] So, what are we
supposed to do?

04:23.057 --> 04:24.475
Go freestyle.

04:27.144 --> 04:29.063
I put that donut in my pants.

04:29.146 --> 04:30.273
[snickering]

04:31.482 --> 04:34.610
Now there's a bunch of white girls
pushing back on us in the TV room.

04:34.694 --> 04:37.280
We gave 'em Tuesday nights,
straight up.

04:37.363 --> 04:39.282
Now they asking for
an extra hour on Thursday

04:39.365 --> 04:41.492
so that they can watch
something called <i>Bones,</i>

04:41.576 --> 04:43.202
which is about a lady
named Bones, apparently?

04:43.286 --> 04:44.995
Give it to them.

04:45.079 --> 04:46.539
You just gonna bend like that?

04:47.582 --> 04:50.460
We got power now.
We can't be petty and shit.

04:50.543 --> 04:52.378
They come to us,
we should be reasonable.

04:52.462 --> 04:54.630
Also, I want order in the cafeteria.

04:54.714 --> 04:56.966
Don't be marching in there,
taking people's tables.

04:57.049 --> 04:58.926
-That ain't fair.
-We gotta sit.

04:59.009 --> 05:02.012
So pick out a couple of tables.
Make them our tables.

05:02.096 --> 05:03.389
Anybody sits there, it's trouble.

05:03.473 --> 05:06.809
They sit somewhere else,
we leave them alone. You hear me?

05:09.103 --> 05:11.481
We don't need the COs
lookin' at us all the time.

05:12.315 --> 05:14.024
[in Spanish] They already
look at us all the time.

05:14.108 --> 05:15.150
While they're frisking us.

05:15.234 --> 05:17.027
[in English] Anybody else?

05:19.279 --> 05:20.823
[sighs]

05:20.906 --> 05:22.241
Okay, we're done.

05:23.283 --> 05:26.829
Oh, and if that Moroccan tweaker
doesn't pay us today,

05:26.912 --> 05:28.831
we start breaking fingers.

05:28.914 --> 05:30.124
Dibs.

05:30.207 --> 05:33.544
Yo, the stop-and-frisk is bullshit.

05:33.628 --> 05:35.295
I hear you,
but they ain't gonna find anything.

05:35.380 --> 05:36.797
It's no problem.

05:36.881 --> 05:38.215
[in Spanish] It's fucking degrading!

05:38.298 --> 05:41.844
Being in prison is fucking degrading.

05:41.927 --> 05:43.929
There's nothing we can do about it,
so let's suck it up, okay?

05:44.013 --> 05:46.181
They're not even really looking
for anything now.

05:46.265 --> 05:47.266
Exactly.

05:47.349 --> 05:49.810
They're just groping us
to show us they can.

05:49.894 --> 05:51.145
It's not right.

05:51.228 --> 05:53.230
Let it go, Blanca.

05:53.856 --> 05:55.608
[in English]
Oh, and take a shower, man!

05:55.691 --> 05:59.069
You smell like a skunk that OD'd
on vinegar and died.

05:59.153 --> 06:01.531
[in Spanish] The lines in the bathroom
are too damn long.

06:01.614 --> 06:03.449
[in English]
There's a lot of us. Go now.

06:03.533 --> 06:05.493
There's no lines.
I'll cover for you in the kitchen.

06:06.869 --> 06:08.037
Thank you.

06:12.124 --> 06:13.208
Hmm.

06:15.961 --> 06:17.296
[Millie] Bianca?

06:17.379 --> 06:18.631
[Blanca sighs]

06:19.715 --> 06:21.634
-Bianca!
-[sighs]

06:23.010 --> 06:24.637
[yelling] Bianca!

06:24.720 --> 06:26.055
[sighs]

06:31.143 --> 06:32.311
Yes, missus?

06:32.394 --> 06:33.604
I'm hungry.

06:33.688 --> 06:34.772
I was in the shower.

06:34.855 --> 06:36.774
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

06:36.857 --> 06:38.025
I got hungry.

06:44.114 --> 06:47.452
[Millie] And heat that soup up
on the stove.

06:47.535 --> 06:49.620
Not the microwave.

06:49.704 --> 06:51.997
-It makes it taste different.
-[sighs]

06:55.585 --> 06:56.794
Margaret called.

06:57.962 --> 06:59.004
Oh.

06:59.088 --> 07:02.257
Too busy to talk to her own mother
more than once a week,

07:02.341 --> 07:03.801
and then when she does call,

07:03.884 --> 07:06.136
she won't stop harping
on the nursing home.

07:07.137 --> 07:12.518
You can't call a structure covered in
spray-on stucco "golden" anything.

07:13.936 --> 07:17.106
I'm speaking to you.
Please don't stand there like a half-wit.

07:17.189 --> 07:18.941
She worries about you.

07:19.024 --> 07:22.027
Oh, not about me.
About herself.

07:22.111 --> 07:23.696
She wants to get her hands on this house.

07:23.779 --> 07:26.073
Pack me off to watch <i>Wheel of Fortune</i>

07:26.156 --> 07:29.452
and drool with other
unloved old people.

07:29.535 --> 07:30.995
No, thank you.

07:31.078 --> 07:32.371
She seemed nice.

07:32.455 --> 07:35.124
Of course she did.
You only met her that one time.

07:35.207 --> 07:37.376
That's how she acts,
you know...

07:37.460 --> 07:39.754
[imitating Margaret] "Oh, I want you
to have doctors nearby

07:39.837 --> 07:40.880
in case you need them."

07:40.963 --> 07:43.591
-[in normal voice] It's all for show.
-What did you tell her?

07:43.674 --> 07:44.759
Same as usual.

07:44.842 --> 07:50.055
"I'm staying right here in my own home.
Go take a long walk on a short pier."

07:50.139 --> 07:51.390
-[inhales sharply]
-[engine whirring]

07:51.474 --> 07:54.101
And I have you,
that's all I need.

08:04.737 --> 08:05.863
Who's that?

08:05.946 --> 08:07.573
A bit of a hood for my taste,

08:07.657 --> 08:11.326
but, uh, Patty from church says
he worked wonders with her shrubs.

08:15.247 --> 08:16.999
This soup is terrible.

08:25.633 --> 08:29.595
I'm starving, but the thought
of actually eating makes me want to yurg.

08:30.721 --> 08:34.058
Well, maybe it's because this food looks
like something a walrus would regurgitate

08:34.140 --> 08:35.559
to feed its least favorite baby.

08:35.643 --> 08:36.852
I-- [grunts]

08:36.936 --> 08:38.854
You know what?
I don't mind it so much anymore.

08:38.938 --> 08:40.940
I did grow up eating mushy food,

08:41.023 --> 08:43.943
because my mother had the weak teeth,
you realize.

08:44.985 --> 08:46.529
Is it, like, super bright in here?

08:46.612 --> 08:48.155
Do you know what I want?

08:49.574 --> 08:50.658
A burger...

08:52.201 --> 08:53.536
from Shake Shack.

08:55.495 --> 08:57.873
I legit just, like,
teared up a little bit.

08:58.916 --> 09:01.126
Seared on the grill with tomato
and melted cheese...

09:01.210 --> 09:06.048
On a fresh, soft, potato roll.

09:07.299 --> 09:09.509
-With a milkshake.
-Nah, don't get greedy.

09:09.594 --> 09:11.511
It's my fantasy.

09:11.596 --> 09:14.306
And I can have a milkshake
with a side of Cate Blanchett.

09:14.389 --> 09:17.685
My veins hurt right now
and you're thinking about sex?

09:17.768 --> 09:19.519
No, dummy.

09:19.604 --> 09:21.606
I want someone to massage my head

09:21.689 --> 09:23.566
and she looks like
she'd have really cool fingers.

09:25.776 --> 09:29.697
Hey, there.
You're really being a bit of a downer.

09:29.780 --> 09:31.115
I'm sorry.

09:32.157 --> 09:34.409
Is my mood not up to your standards?

09:35.703 --> 09:39.039
No one asked you to plop yourself
down right in front of me.

09:39.123 --> 09:41.834
[scoffs] I'm sitting here
'cause we're all friends.

09:41.917 --> 09:43.628
Okay, is that what we are now?

09:43.711 --> 09:46.672
You need to stop blaming me
for finding someone, hon.

09:46.756 --> 09:48.674
-Mmm-hmm.
-It's not like my feelings for you

09:48.758 --> 09:49.800
just went away.

09:49.884 --> 09:56.556
But I... didn't just jump into the first
pair of Mookee pants that came along.

09:57.349 --> 09:59.518
I have no idea what you did...

10:00.728 --> 10:02.271
but you sure as fuck did something,

10:02.354 --> 10:04.649
because you can't
keep your head up right now.

10:04.732 --> 10:08.736
Don't try to change the subject,
okay? [scoffs]

10:08.819 --> 10:10.404
It's been, like, months

10:10.487 --> 10:14.909
and how do you even meet someone,
let alone get married--

10:14.992 --> 10:18.704
Okay, stop. Stop it.
Stop it. You left.

10:18.788 --> 10:20.539
You were the one who left, right?

10:20.623 --> 10:22.041
I didn't know if you were coming back.

10:22.124 --> 10:25.460
And it's your fault, because you love
heroin more than you loved me.

10:26.837 --> 10:30.549
For your information,
I was clean at the time,

10:30.633 --> 10:33.510
you peanut-brained,
fickle-hearted whore.

10:37.306 --> 10:38.390
So...

10:39.892 --> 10:42.645
So, how is everyone?

10:42.728 --> 10:44.313
Oh, you know.

10:44.396 --> 10:46.649
-[scoffs]
-Pretty awesome.

10:54.824 --> 10:55.991
She's on drugs, Red.

10:56.075 --> 10:58.368
-[scoffs] Oh, God.
-[Lorna] Just take a look at her.

10:58.452 --> 11:00.412
She's smacked out of her gourd.

11:04.624 --> 11:05.668
[sighs]

11:06.669 --> 11:08.628
What, are we all gonna pretend
this isn't happening?

11:10.630 --> 11:11.966
[Lorna scoffs]

11:19.223 --> 11:20.390
Feels like a "yes."

11:25.145 --> 11:27.857
Food stays in the cafeteria, Sister.
You know that.

11:27.940 --> 11:29.859
I'll do what I want,
you moron.

11:30.901 --> 11:33.070
You fucking moron.

11:35.447 --> 11:37.407
I think your blood sugar
might be off again, Sister.

11:37.491 --> 11:39.659
Oh, you think?

11:39.744 --> 11:41.829
With your teeny-tiny brain?

11:47.793 --> 11:50.004
[softly] Look, just take it, okay?

11:50.087 --> 11:51.964
And don't tell anyone.

11:57.177 --> 11:59.513
[man speaking indistinctly on PA]

11:59.596 --> 12:02.307
You know, if you're gonna poop
in the shower,

12:02.391 --> 12:04.059
at least you could plan ahead.

12:04.143 --> 12:07.687
Like, do it in a shower cap,
and take it with you after.

12:07.772 --> 12:09.606
Just common decency.

12:09.689 --> 12:12.484
But you wouldn't know
anything about that, would you?

12:12.567 --> 12:15.821
I mean, I know for some people,
drugs is the most important thing.

12:15.905 --> 12:19.574
But guess what?
For the rest of us, we have feelings.

12:19.658 --> 12:22.828
And noses and gag reflexes.

12:22.912 --> 12:26.623
And Janitorial is hard enough
without you leaving your mess behind,

12:26.706 --> 12:28.708
once you found what you been looking for.

12:31.336 --> 12:34.089
And I think you might have worms.

12:34.173 --> 12:36.091
So deal with that.

12:36.967 --> 12:38.135
[gasps]

12:43.307 --> 12:45.017
-Okay, gun to your head...
-Mmm-hmm.

12:45.100 --> 12:46.393
...do you run over an old lady,

12:46.476 --> 12:49.563
or do you turn the wheel
and crash yourself into a wall?

12:49.646 --> 12:50.898
How old is the old lady?

12:50.981 --> 12:52.983
[sighs]

12:53.067 --> 12:55.319
Seventy-six...
No, seventy-two.

12:55.402 --> 12:57.237
How's her health?

12:57.321 --> 12:58.697
-You know, it's been better.
-Mmm-hmm.

12:58.780 --> 13:01.951
But she's all there in her head.
You know, she does puzzles and shit.

13:02.910 --> 13:05.620
-I think I mow her down.
-Me, too.

13:07.581 --> 13:08.916
Gun to your head,

13:08.999 --> 13:11.710
-do you eat ten dead flies...
-Ugh!

13:11.793 --> 13:13.545
...or an alive baby mouse?

13:13.628 --> 13:15.339
-Mmm! Flies, for sure.
-Gross!

13:15.422 --> 13:18.217
The wings would stick to your tongue
and your tonsils and everything.

13:18.300 --> 13:20.385
Yeah, but at least
it won't be wiggling no more.

13:20.469 --> 13:22.930
A baby mouse is like a big jelly bean.

13:23.013 --> 13:24.306
I would just swallow it whole.

13:26.016 --> 13:28.727
Speaking of flies on the wall.
Hmm.

13:29.769 --> 13:32.814
Hey, watch out for this one.
She's more than meets the eye.

13:32.898 --> 13:34.816
Mmm, I don't know about that.

13:34.900 --> 13:38.320
I mean, we've been friends for a long time
and as far as I can see,

13:38.403 --> 13:39.613
it's all pretty much right here.

13:39.696 --> 13:41.949
Hmm. I guess you don't know her like I do.

13:43.408 --> 13:46.578
[in Spanish] You got something going on
in that van,

13:46.661 --> 13:47.997
don't you, princess?

14:00.425 --> 14:01.801
Did you get the money?

14:03.220 --> 14:05.180
No, they've not sent the check yet.

14:05.264 --> 14:07.516
-[sighs]
-And I think he knows.

14:08.600 --> 14:09.851
He's toying with me.

14:09.935 --> 14:12.062
Ordered me to search for a phone
that's currently in my pocket.

14:12.146 --> 14:14.106
No, I don't think that man toys.

14:15.107 --> 14:17.192
Oh, I have a shifty face.
I can't help it.

14:17.276 --> 14:18.735
I come from shifty-faced people.

14:18.818 --> 14:20.654
I invite suspicion
even when I'm not guilty.

14:22.572 --> 14:24.699
Man, if they trace this thing
to my fuckin' number--

14:24.783 --> 14:26.160
Joel.

14:26.243 --> 14:28.913
They are just a bunch of bozos
who failed Police Academy.

14:28.996 --> 14:30.664
They've been to war!

14:31.331 --> 14:35.127
<i>Inside Weekly</i> has a vested interest
in protecting their sources.

14:35.210 --> 14:37.922
You know, I gotta tell you,
this pissin'-in-your-pants thing

14:38.005 --> 14:39.506
is kind of a turn-off.

14:40.799 --> 14:42.217
Well, at least there's that.

14:45.345 --> 14:47.306
[inmates chatting indistinctly]

14:49.058 --> 14:50.392
[clicks tongue]

14:50.475 --> 14:52.519
[man speaking indistinctly on PA]

14:52.602 --> 14:54.980
DeMarco.
That's Italian, right?

14:55.064 --> 14:57.649
Nah, I'm 100% Hispanic.

14:57.732 --> 15:00.402
Don't let the classical features fool you.

15:00.485 --> 15:02.571
I could be up to anything.

15:02.654 --> 15:04.114
Okay.

15:05.365 --> 15:06.700
Take your time.

15:06.783 --> 15:09.244
<i>Ay, caramba.</i>

15:10.245 --> 15:12.206
[woman speaking indistinctly
on walkie-talkie]

15:14.083 --> 15:16.168
Jesus Christ, inmate.

15:16.251 --> 15:17.544
I'm going, okay?

15:17.627 --> 15:20.214
Yeah, get outta here.
Maybe boil those clothes.

15:28.805 --> 15:31.516
[in Spanish] Truth is, I don't know
what we would do without you, Dario.

15:31.600 --> 15:33.518
You make it so much easier.

15:33.602 --> 15:35.895
For you, it's my pleasure.

15:37.397 --> 15:40.109
No one calls me Dario, you know.

15:40.859 --> 15:43.487
-What do they call you?
-Diablo.

15:44.238 --> 15:46.240
I was a little wild
when I was younger.

15:46.323 --> 15:48.325
Went to jail for a while.

15:48.408 --> 15:49.659
What for?

15:49.743 --> 15:51.996
Armed robbery.

15:52.079 --> 15:53.372
We hit up a jewelry store.

15:53.455 --> 15:54.831
A jewel thief?

15:54.914 --> 15:56.458
Oh, so you were a bad boy.

15:56.541 --> 15:58.710
[in English] I can't understand
what you're saying.

15:58.793 --> 16:00.004
It's rude.

16:00.087 --> 16:02.172
[in English]
Let's get you in the car, okay?

16:05.717 --> 16:07.927
[in Spanish] But... you aren't
scared of me, are you?

16:08.012 --> 16:10.722
I killed her husband.

16:12.516 --> 16:14.351
[both laugh]

16:14.434 --> 16:15.560
Okay, not really.

16:15.644 --> 16:16.645
[both chuckle]

16:17.980 --> 16:19.064
[in English] Careful.

16:19.148 --> 16:20.732
[sighs]

16:20.815 --> 16:23.318
[in Spanish] But sometimes
I wish I'd done more exciting things.

16:24.444 --> 16:25.988
Not murder.

16:26.071 --> 16:28.782
But... what do I know?

16:28.865 --> 16:30.117
Something more.

16:31.201 --> 16:32.744
Travel, for example.

16:33.620 --> 16:35.372
I've never even been to New York City.

16:35.455 --> 16:37.374
Ah, good.
There's still time, you know?

16:39.001 --> 16:40.127
[sighs]

16:40.210 --> 16:41.545
I live with an old lady.

16:42.504 --> 16:44.464
I have to send money back home.

16:44.548 --> 16:45.674
Mmm. Mmm-mmm.

16:47.301 --> 16:48.343
Bianca!

16:48.427 --> 16:51.138
-[sighs]
-Why are you loitering? Let's go.

16:51.221 --> 16:53.640
[in English] Just a minute. [groans]

16:53.723 --> 16:55.017
[in Spanish] Why does she call you Bianca?

16:55.100 --> 16:58.520
She read my name before she met me
and she thought the "L" was an "I."

16:58.603 --> 16:59.938
Now she says she likes it better.

17:00.022 --> 17:01.898
[laughing]

17:01.981 --> 17:03.358
That's fucked up.

17:04.733 --> 17:06.194
What do I care, right?

17:09.656 --> 17:10.740
[Millie pounding on window]

17:10.824 --> 17:14.536
[Millie] I'm waiting!
Get in the car!

17:16.163 --> 17:17.580
[sighs]

17:20.166 --> 17:21.335
[Diablo snickers]

17:23.170 --> 17:24.878
[in Spanish] So... we'll see each other.

17:29.509 --> 17:30.594
[Luschek] <i>Score.</i>

17:35.474 --> 17:36.933
That's six phones for me.

17:43.857 --> 17:44.941
[sighs]

17:52.907 --> 17:54.076
This is new.

17:55.077 --> 17:56.495
It's my "me" time.

17:56.578 --> 17:58.330
You get out in two days.

17:58.413 --> 17:59.914
You're gonna have
all-you-can-eat "me" time.

17:59.998 --> 18:02.751
And I'm gonna need it,
the way you're up in my ass in here.

18:05.087 --> 18:06.796
Look, just 'cause I'm getting out,

18:06.880 --> 18:10.342
don't mean we gonna get all "Kumbaya"
and shit right now, okay?

18:10.425 --> 18:12.427
There's gonna be no crying

18:12.511 --> 18:15.514
or making each other
friendship bracelets or whatever.

18:15.597 --> 18:17.182
[sighs]

18:17.266 --> 18:18.933
I just thought we could hang out.

18:19.017 --> 18:21.478
Burn your ugly face into my brain...

18:21.561 --> 18:23.563
so I can remember you
when it's too peaceful around here.

18:23.647 --> 18:25.524
[scoffs]

18:25.607 --> 18:27.109
Please.

18:27.192 --> 18:29.611
Don't pretend like you ain't gonna be
relieved when I'm gone.

18:30.529 --> 18:31.738
Oh, trust.

18:31.821 --> 18:34.032
It's gonna be a party
when that van door closes on your ass.

18:35.825 --> 18:36.951
[sighs]

18:37.035 --> 18:38.995
But you're still my mom.

18:40.955 --> 18:42.207
I'm gonna miss you.

18:43.500 --> 18:45.544
Listen, we're grown-ups.

18:45.627 --> 18:46.836
It is what it is.

18:57.347 --> 18:58.682
[sighs]

18:58.765 --> 19:01.268
Tell me what you
know about this.

19:01.351 --> 19:03.478
-Hmm.
-[clicks tongue] Nothin'.

19:05.814 --> 19:07.399
What, you think that's me?

19:09.901 --> 19:11.195
Let's call it a hunch.

19:12.154 --> 19:15.532
All right. How 'bout you let me take this,
okay, hun-bun?

19:15.615 --> 19:19.661
Now, we are both as upset
as you are about this, I can assure you.

19:19.744 --> 19:23.665
You know, we have done our best,
with very limited resources...

19:25.375 --> 19:28.712
to try and...
make you comfortable here.

19:28.795 --> 19:31.590
Now, I appreciate that,
I really do.

19:36.303 --> 19:39.389
And you repay us by staging
and selling...

19:39.473 --> 19:41.350
[stuttering] this crazy photo?

19:41.433 --> 19:44.186
Look, I... I don't want to sound
like I'm full of myself... [chuckles]

19:44.269 --> 19:46.396
but, you know,
there are people out there,

19:46.480 --> 19:48.398
and in here,
in this case,

19:48.482 --> 19:50.942
who are interested
in taking pictures of celebrities,

19:51.025 --> 19:53.027
even minor ones such as myself.

19:53.111 --> 19:56.865
Mmm-hmm. It ain't her fault the paps
after her like a Jolie-Pitt baby.

19:56.948 --> 20:01.077
Ah. You're saying you had
no knowledge of this photo being taken.

20:01.160 --> 20:03.413
I'm just living my life, Mr. Caputo.

20:04.498 --> 20:08.210
And while I am aware
that a jailhouse romance is discouraged...

20:09.294 --> 20:10.879
sometimes... [sighs]

20:10.962 --> 20:13.257
you just can't fight your passions.

20:15.467 --> 20:19.929
Now, I'm sure that you are no stranger
to the vagaries of love.

20:21.180 --> 20:23.767
Jesus, Judy, give me a break here.

20:23.850 --> 20:26.561
[inhaling deeply]
The heart wants what it wants.

20:30.565 --> 20:35.654
And you're telling me...
that your heart wants...

20:37.614 --> 20:39.157
-her?
-Mmm-hmm.

20:39.241 --> 20:42.661
[clicks tongue] What, you ain't never
heard of a May-December romance before?

20:43.787 --> 20:46.748
I think it's more like June-October.
[chuckles]

20:46.831 --> 20:49.208
-[chuckles]
-[sighs]

20:49.293 --> 20:51.753
I'm the sexy arm candy here

20:51.836 --> 20:54.923
and Judy Pants is my aging playboy.

20:55.882 --> 20:58.927
-Ah...
-Mmm. [cooing]

20:59.010 --> 21:00.094
It's classic.

21:00.178 --> 21:03.973
I hear you walk out of here

21:04.057 --> 21:06.476
and went your separate ways,

21:06.560 --> 21:11.940
I will come down on both of you
like <i>The Wrath of Khan.</i>

21:12.023 --> 21:13.400
Like in <i>Star Trek?</i>

21:13.483 --> 21:16.278
I mean God.
The wrath of God.

21:16.361 --> 21:18.488
This better be the real thing.

21:18.572 --> 21:22.075
Hey, this is a lot of pressure
to put on a new relationship.

21:23.076 --> 21:26.538
In your case, I'm sure it'll just bring
the two of you closer together.

21:27.456 --> 21:30.041
-I think so, yes. My girl.
-[chuckles]

21:31.626 --> 21:32.919
Please leave.

21:53.690 --> 21:55.900
[sighs] Guess I could grab a beverage
while we're waiting.

21:57.611 --> 21:58.862
I ain't telling you what to do,

21:58.945 --> 22:02.949
but I kinda feel like staying sharp
and letting them get messed up early

22:03.032 --> 22:05.369
is the only way you're gonna
dominate beer pong later.

22:07.078 --> 22:08.204
Maybe you're right.

22:08.287 --> 22:09.664
[clattering]

22:22.761 --> 22:26.014
You ever think about how it's weird
that there's always a gardener around

22:26.097 --> 22:28.725
when there's a whole grounds crew
that basically works for free?

22:29.809 --> 22:32.103
You're right, that is weird.
[sniffs]

22:33.480 --> 22:36.858
Also he has really nice shirts...
for a gardener.

22:41.279 --> 22:42.321
Hey, you!

22:43.948 --> 22:46.284
[Dixon] Yeah, you!
Stay right there!

22:49.663 --> 22:50.997
[panting]

22:51.998 --> 22:53.041
[grunts]

22:55.502 --> 22:56.795
[groans]

22:59.130 --> 23:01.382
-Why are you running?
-[stutters] No reason.

23:01.466 --> 23:02.884
[grunts]

23:05.094 --> 23:06.471
[panting]

23:06.555 --> 23:08.473
What are you,
some kind of perv?

23:08.557 --> 23:12.226
Trying to jerk it through the fence
to some prison tang?

23:12.310 --> 23:15.522
I see you around here again,
you'll be shitting your own teeth, Pablo.

23:21.486 --> 23:23.613
[Digori] What's this thing
supposed to be, anyway?

23:23.697 --> 23:26.282
[Brandy] I thought Caputo said it was
supposed to be a school or somethin'.

23:26.365 --> 23:28.076
Fuck that.

23:28.159 --> 23:31.412
I don't want anyone stickin' anything
in my brain I didn't give say-so for.

23:31.496 --> 23:34.123
We could all stand
to learn stuff, I guess.

23:34.207 --> 23:35.625
[scoffs] Come on.

23:35.709 --> 23:39.921
They're gonna send some volunteer
college derp with a straight part

23:40.004 --> 23:42.799
who's gonna get all <i>Dangerous Minds</i>
when it turns out you can't read.

23:43.883 --> 23:44.968
You can't read?

23:46.720 --> 23:49.681
I mean, I probably can.

23:49.764 --> 23:52.350
I'm not stupid.
I just choose not to.

23:54.686 --> 23:57.481
Well, that's how they get you.
With words.

23:57.564 --> 23:59.733
They put ideas in the words
that make you start thinking.

24:00.609 --> 24:02.235
I never thought about it that way.

24:02.360 --> 24:03.820
Yeah.

24:03.903 --> 24:05.489
Well, then,
all of a sudden you're like,

24:05.572 --> 24:08.241
"What if other people
are having these experiences

24:08.324 --> 24:11.452
that are different than mine,
but still totally legit?

24:11.536 --> 24:14.498
And what if I'm supposed to think about
that before I start judging their lives?"

24:14.581 --> 24:17.584
That's... chaos. [scoffs]

24:17.667 --> 24:20.378
Yeah.
No, thank you.

24:23.965 --> 24:25.341
Should we do something about Nicky?

24:25.424 --> 24:26.510
Like what?

24:28.052 --> 24:31.681
Look, it's not like I don't care.
I've just seen it before, you know?

24:31.765 --> 24:33.892
You can't make them change
unless they want to,

24:33.975 --> 24:35.977
and if you try, they usually end up
hating your guts.

24:36.060 --> 24:39.063
I really just think
we shouldn't have done...

24:40.607 --> 24:43.234
you know, crack.
With her.

24:43.317 --> 24:46.530
Well, yeah.
I mean, in hindsight.

24:48.114 --> 24:52.744
Although, to be fair...
crack is like potato chips to Nicky.

24:52.827 --> 24:55.664
A little something to slake your appetite
while you're figuring out dinner.

24:56.372 --> 24:57.624
Speaking of dinner.

25:01.460 --> 25:02.796
CO Bayley.

25:03.672 --> 25:04.673
Chapman.

25:04.756 --> 25:06.132
-Hi.
-Hmm.

25:06.215 --> 25:07.926
Vause and I were thinking,

25:08.009 --> 25:09.844
since you're such a super-nice guy

25:09.928 --> 25:12.388
and so good at moving things
across enemy lines...

25:12.471 --> 25:13.973
What do you want now?

25:14.057 --> 25:16.517
-A burger.
-Two, ideally. One for each of us.

25:16.601 --> 25:19.145
-With cheese. Yep.
-Cheese is key.

25:20.521 --> 25:23.191
Uh... Yeah.

25:23.274 --> 25:24.358
Really?

25:25.276 --> 25:28.487
Sure.
Oh, but first I get a handjob.

25:28.572 --> 25:30.990
-[Alex groans]
-You know, from before.

25:31.074 --> 25:33.409
The panty thing.
You basically owe me.

25:33.492 --> 25:34.869
Hmm.

25:40.124 --> 25:41.960
They grow up so fast.

25:48.675 --> 25:49.884
[clears throat]

25:49.968 --> 25:51.845
Boo. Hey.

25:51.928 --> 25:53.722
Oh, hey.

25:53.805 --> 25:55.431
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Give.

25:55.514 --> 25:56.683
[both chuckle]

25:57.892 --> 26:00.311
So, something kind of weird happened.

26:00.394 --> 26:01.730
Oh, yeah? [sniffs]

26:03.147 --> 26:04.649
Donuts apologized.

26:04.733 --> 26:06.735
[laughs] Right.

26:06.818 --> 26:08.236
No, he did, for real.

26:09.320 --> 26:10.614
He was really sweet about it.

26:10.697 --> 26:13.199
Ooh.
Well, good for him, huh?

26:15.368 --> 26:18.454
Oh, oh, hell, no.

26:18.537 --> 26:21.666
No, no, no, Doggett.
That ain't the way this works.

26:21.750 --> 26:25.086
He doesn't get to constantly rape someone
and then apologize and make it go away.

26:25.169 --> 26:27.546
I'm not saying it's gotta just "go away."

26:29.674 --> 26:33.302
Boo, I am so tired of walking around
feeling shitty every day.

26:33.386 --> 26:36.055
Fine, but guess what?

26:36.139 --> 26:39.225
He gets to feel shitty
for the rest of his natural life.

26:39.308 --> 26:42.646
Oh, and beyond when
he's a tandoori skewer in hell.

26:42.729 --> 26:47.191
What if he's just like a regular person
who made a mistake?

26:48.526 --> 26:51.863
Right? I mean, come on,
we both know I'm not innocent.

26:51.946 --> 26:53.364
Yeah, but you never--

26:54.532 --> 26:56.117
Okay, you did...

26:56.200 --> 26:57.994
shoot a human being
with a hunting rifle.

26:58.077 --> 26:59.453
But she had it coming.

27:03.457 --> 27:04.583
[softly] No, she didn't.

27:05.584 --> 27:08.797
I do not like where this is headed.

27:09.839 --> 27:13.009
Oh, Boo,
he ain't goin' anywhere, okay?

27:13.092 --> 27:15.386
And we all live here together.

27:15.469 --> 27:18.472
And I'm really tired of walkin' around
like a dog with mange.

27:18.556 --> 27:21.184
You should've rammed that broomstick
right up his sphincter

27:21.267 --> 27:22.518
when you had the chance!

27:23.687 --> 27:26.981
You know, the thing is, I really liked him
before all that happened.

27:28.066 --> 27:31.360
If you go back to giving that maggot
the time of day,

27:31.444 --> 27:35.531
I swear to fuckin' God, Doggett,
to God...

27:35.614 --> 27:36.657
I'm done with you!

27:38.827 --> 27:41.579
[softly] Fuckin' kiddin' me
with this shit.

27:41.662 --> 27:42.914
[grunts]

27:57.553 --> 27:59.013
How's it going, kids?

27:59.097 --> 28:00.223
[exhaling]

28:05.103 --> 28:06.771
You're sure feeling frisky today.

28:07.856 --> 28:11.567
I've transgressed, and I'm ready
to accept my punishment.

28:13.194 --> 28:14.487
[sighs]

28:18.657 --> 28:20.659
Yo, McCullough.

28:22.203 --> 28:25.248
I believe this makes the score
11 to 8.

28:25.331 --> 28:26.791
God damn it.

28:26.875 --> 28:29.878
Uh, say a dozen Hail Marys
or something.

28:31.587 --> 28:32.881
[sighs]

28:32.964 --> 28:36.134
It was actually super nice.
We went to Starbucks in Hoboken.

28:36.926 --> 28:38.511
Did you know you can
get a Frappuccino there

28:38.594 --> 28:40.054
that tastes just like Fruity Pebbles?

28:40.138 --> 28:42.849
-Get out.
-It's on the secret menu.

28:42.932 --> 28:46.310
-Vince told me about it.
-Oh... that's nice.

28:47.228 --> 28:48.396
Did he talk about me?

28:48.479 --> 28:50.273
Oh, of course, he did.

28:50.356 --> 28:51.816
Kept sayin' how much he misses you.

28:51.900 --> 28:54.235
Well, if he misses me so much,
why'd he skip visitation?

28:54.318 --> 28:55.611
Why is he dodging my calls?

28:55.694 --> 28:58.990
It's a long drive, Lorna.
And he works.

28:59.073 --> 29:02.994
And the football just started.
You know how boys are.

29:03.077 --> 29:04.453
I thought you're supposed to be
on my side.

29:04.537 --> 29:06.372
I am. I am.

29:06.455 --> 29:08.082
I'm just saying, you know.

29:09.167 --> 29:12.378
I think he's a good person.
Real sweet.

29:14.672 --> 29:16.257
Did he mention anyone else?

29:16.340 --> 29:17.967
Nothing like that.

29:19.052 --> 29:22.388
I mean, honestly,
he seems kinda lonely.

29:22.471 --> 29:23.681
Good.

29:25.099 --> 29:27.852
I invited him to our tailgate
next weekend.

29:29.062 --> 29:31.022
-Really?
-Why not?

29:31.105 --> 29:32.481
I figured he and Jack would get along.

29:32.565 --> 29:33.983
Oh, he and Jack?

29:34.067 --> 29:38.112
Sure. He's so funny,
that Vinny. [chuckles]

29:38.196 --> 29:39.488
I know.
I know he's funny.

29:39.572 --> 29:42.741
Because he's my husband,
'cause I married him, in case you forgot.

29:42.826 --> 29:44.786
You asked me to go meet up with him.

29:45.912 --> 29:47.455
[breathes deeply]

29:49.165 --> 29:52.251
-What did you wear?
-The usual.

29:52.335 --> 29:54.170
A top and a skirt.

29:55.629 --> 29:58.591
Oh, my God!

30:00.134 --> 30:01.260
Oh...

30:09.393 --> 30:11.229
[man speaking indistinctly on PA]

30:11.312 --> 30:12.897
[in Spanish] Guess who
didn't get frisked today?

30:12.981 --> 30:14.315
[in English] This guy.

30:14.398 --> 30:16.234
What'd you do,
dress up like a book?

30:16.317 --> 30:17.526
No.

30:17.610 --> 30:19.863
[in Spanish] I didn't do anything.
Including shower.

30:20.779 --> 30:21.906
If you stink, they don't touch you.

30:21.990 --> 30:24.033
-[in English] Gross, man.
-Gross?

30:24.117 --> 30:25.869
[in Spanish] I'm a rebel genius.

30:25.952 --> 30:27.829
The Che Guevara of hallway groping.

30:27.912 --> 30:31.665
People already think Dominicans
are dirty and low class.

30:31.749 --> 30:32.750
Where's your dignity?

30:32.834 --> 30:35.211
If dignity for you is letting a guard
stick his hand up your shirt,

30:35.294 --> 30:36.420
then be my guest.

30:36.504 --> 30:37.922
[in English] Yo, she do got a point.

30:38.006 --> 30:40.341
Oh-- Nah, B.
I gotta shower every day,

30:40.424 --> 30:42.760
or I get sticky between my <i>tetas.</i>

30:44.595 --> 30:45.972
[in English]
You don't gotta be dirty.

30:47.056 --> 30:48.474
You just gotta smell bad.

30:49.392 --> 30:50.434
I see.

30:50.518 --> 30:52.728
[in Spanish] A little behind the ears?

30:52.811 --> 30:54.522
They treat us like we're not people.

30:54.605 --> 30:56.858
[in English] I got these pudding cups
from commissary

30:56.941 --> 30:59.735
and when I opened one, it was rancid.
Smells like a fart died.

31:00.862 --> 31:03.781
This pepper shit makes my eyes water.

31:04.908 --> 31:06.034
[in Spanish] Now you're talking.

31:08.369 --> 31:10.288
[in English] Oh, shit.

31:10.371 --> 31:11.873
[groans]

31:11.956 --> 31:14.583
-It burns! It burns! Shit!
-[all laughing]

31:16.752 --> 31:18.296
Ah! Shit!

31:18.379 --> 31:19.755
[cackling]

31:20.756 --> 31:23.092
Oh, come on!

31:23.176 --> 31:25.636
I've been looking for this church door
for ten minutes

31:25.719 --> 31:27.805
and it was right there in your pile.

31:27.889 --> 31:29.307
Sorry.

31:32.435 --> 31:33.769
Where's Dario?

31:33.852 --> 31:35.729
I had to let him go.

31:36.314 --> 31:37.523
He did something wrong?

31:37.606 --> 31:40.902
I felt he wasn't as focused
as he should be.

31:42.195 --> 31:43.529
What are you saying?

31:43.612 --> 31:48.201
I'm saying that you have a job to do,
and he was a big distraction.

31:48.284 --> 31:50.619
And those tattoos.

31:50.703 --> 31:53.581
You're jealous... because we had fun.

31:53.664 --> 31:57.626
Fun? I saw the way he looked at you.
Dirty!

31:57.710 --> 31:59.378
You get involved with a person like that

31:59.462 --> 32:01.672
and you'll regret it,
sooner rather than later.

32:01.755 --> 32:02.798
I promise you.

32:02.881 --> 32:05.176
Now, I-- I have to go
to the little girls' room.

32:05.259 --> 32:06.844
That was his job.

32:07.761 --> 32:09.430
That's how he earns a living.

32:10.556 --> 32:12.058
He's a person.

32:12.141 --> 32:14.060
And I'm a person.

32:14.143 --> 32:15.894
I don't just live to work for you.

32:15.979 --> 32:17.855
I'm not going to be around forever, honey.

32:17.939 --> 32:20.149
And I have half a mind
to leave this house to you,

32:20.233 --> 32:22.443
if only to teach Margaret a lesson.

32:22.526 --> 32:24.195
So, you keep playing your cards right

32:24.278 --> 32:25.863
and you might be looking
at a very bright future.

32:25.947 --> 32:29.117
[scoffs] But I have to put
my life and my hoo-ha in storage.

32:29.200 --> 32:31.535
[scoffs] Don't be vulgar, Bianca.

32:31.619 --> 32:33.204
Now, I said I have to pee!

32:42.255 --> 32:43.464
[straining]

32:48.469 --> 32:49.678
[both grunt]

32:51.097 --> 32:53.057
[inmates chatting indistinctly]

32:58.146 --> 33:01.357
Let's talk about how my cousin
got tackled in the woods.

33:02.858 --> 33:04.568
He's burnt on this job now.

33:05.069 --> 33:06.904
-Yeah, that's a downer.
-Really?

33:06.988 --> 33:09.282
You wanna cut the attitude or
should I come back with some friends?

33:09.365 --> 33:11.117
I got nothing to do with that, okay?

33:11.200 --> 33:12.576
I can't help what happens out there.

33:12.660 --> 33:15.079
[scoffs] You think
I'm some kind of shit-for-brains?

33:15.163 --> 33:17.831
You tell me you don't want to run no more
and three days later

33:17.915 --> 33:20.584
the game blows up
when there's no one around except you?

33:21.585 --> 33:24.755
That creepy guard was all up in it,
you can ask Gonzales.

33:24.838 --> 33:26.799
Lurking around,
dropping hints and shit.

33:26.882 --> 33:28.551
It was gonna go jank any minute,
I'm telling you.

33:28.634 --> 33:30.386
Then you come to me about it.

33:30.469 --> 33:32.846
This is my business
and I make the fucking decisions--

33:32.930 --> 33:34.307
Oh, I know you do.

33:34.390 --> 33:36.725
And if he came after us,
you would've decided

33:36.809 --> 33:38.727
to push me under the bus
in one second.

33:38.811 --> 33:40.438
And walk away like you never knew me,

33:40.521 --> 33:42.231
and don't even try to front
like that ain't the truth.

33:43.732 --> 33:45.109
Van.

33:45.193 --> 33:46.819
It's not a bus,
it's a van.

33:48.612 --> 33:51.949
I saved you.
And I ain't even Dominican.

33:53.367 --> 33:56.370
So, if you wanna bruise me up,
I guess I can't do much about it.

33:59.915 --> 34:01.292
Walk, Ramos!

34:04.587 --> 34:05.629
Faster.

34:12.719 --> 34:14.429
Think about it this way...

34:14.513 --> 34:18.809
You have maybe five minutes
of pig-in-a-blanket...

34:18.891 --> 34:21.520
for eight or nine minutes
of pure burger bliss.

34:21.603 --> 34:23.813
Just don't look down because if his dick
looks like a chicken neck,

34:23.897 --> 34:24.940
you'll never unsee it.

34:25.023 --> 34:27.275
Why are we assuming that I'm the one
who's going to be doing it?

34:27.360 --> 34:28.902
[chuckles]
'Cause you're the straight one.

34:28.985 --> 34:32.447
Fuck you. Guaranteed lifetime tally,
you have given more handjobs than I have.

34:32.531 --> 34:34.574
-Ten to one.
-Only to get out of having sex.

34:34.658 --> 34:36.119
Whereas I just had the sex.

34:36.202 --> 34:38.871
Ergo, this is your field of expertise.

34:38.954 --> 34:41.165
You think this kid needs an expert?

34:41.248 --> 34:43.126
I seriously doubt he's a connoisseur.

34:43.208 --> 34:45.878
Also, you're the one that gave him
the handjob idea to begin with.

34:45.960 --> 34:49.465
Because society has conditioned me
to see female sexuality as currency.

34:49.547 --> 34:53.219
Right! And it's time to spend
a little in exchange for a burger.

34:53.302 --> 34:54.887
Touché.

35:00.601 --> 35:01.977
How're you doing?

35:02.060 --> 35:03.104
[sighs]

35:04.105 --> 35:07.275
Um, I mean, I have nightmares,
paranoia...

35:09.067 --> 35:11.195
sweaty, PTSD micro-flashbacks,

35:11.279 --> 35:14.198
but other than that...
it's horrible.

35:18.286 --> 35:20.037
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

35:23.624 --> 35:26.544
I did sound insane.
I get that.

35:28.837 --> 35:30.339
I guess we're not gonna get
those burgers, huh?

35:30.423 --> 35:31.632
Probably not.

35:33.050 --> 35:34.510
Also, because we could both probably use,

35:34.593 --> 35:38.514
like, a week where we don't do
something pathetic and/or...

35:38.597 --> 35:39.682
morally incriminating.

35:39.765 --> 35:41.142
Where your first thought
in the morning isn't,

35:41.225 --> 35:43.644
"I have defiled myself
in the eyes of God and man."

35:43.727 --> 35:45.479
Imagine what that would feel like.

35:46.939 --> 35:48.357
It's no melted cheese and onion.

35:48.441 --> 35:49.775
[sighing]

35:52.611 --> 35:53.779
Next!

35:56.114 --> 35:57.200
Whoa!

35:58.367 --> 36:00.536
Man, I know Latina girls
are supposed to be spicy,

36:00.619 --> 36:01.995
but I had no idea it was this literal.

36:02.079 --> 36:04.540
You ever hear anything
about a general fishiness?

36:04.623 --> 36:05.666
-Hey!
-Hmm?

36:05.749 --> 36:07.084
You might want to check in
with Medical, inmate.

36:07.168 --> 36:08.752
-Hmm?
-Mmm-hmm.

36:10.338 --> 36:12.423
[woman speaking indistinctly
on walkie-talkie]

36:14.175 --> 36:15.426
[sniffs] Ugh!

36:16.469 --> 36:18.095
I thought I told you
to shower, Flores.

36:18.179 --> 36:19.972
Oh, yeah,
I plan to get on that.

36:20.973 --> 36:23.642
[coughs] This isn't BO.

36:23.726 --> 36:25.478
You've doused yourself in something evil.

36:27.438 --> 36:28.731
Is this some kind of game?

36:29.732 --> 36:31.359
<i>Jenga</i> is a game.

36:31.442 --> 36:33.777
-This is civil disobedience.
-Yeah, well, it's over.

36:33.861 --> 36:36.280
Next time I see you,
you smell like a goddamn daisy

36:36.364 --> 36:37.531
or you're not gonna like
what happens next.

36:37.615 --> 36:40.618
You can put me in jail, but you can't
tell me what to do with my own body.

36:40.701 --> 36:42.536
And yet, it's happening.

36:43.537 --> 36:45.414
Go get cleaned up.
With soap!

36:46.832 --> 36:48.292
And I'm not messing around.

36:48.376 --> 36:49.543
I'm talking to all of you.

36:55.799 --> 36:57.801
So, I said,

36:57.885 --> 37:00.471
-"Now listen, you limey bitch!"
-Ooh!

37:00.554 --> 37:02.180
-[chuckles]
-"You steal one more recipe from me

37:02.265 --> 37:04.892
and I'm gonna have to put you
through the grinder attachment

37:04.975 --> 37:07.520
to your KitchenAid
Professional Series Mixer."

37:07.603 --> 37:09.438
[laughing] Oh, shit! Yo.

37:09.522 --> 37:13.901
[chuckles] Man!
Who knew Nigella was so basic?

37:13.984 --> 37:16.069
And, you know, the truth is...

37:16.153 --> 37:18.071
she is awesome.

37:18.155 --> 37:20.699
I mean, we get high together sometimes
and make out.

37:21.325 --> 37:22.868
-Oh, and...
-Hmm.

37:22.951 --> 37:26.955
...she has a dessert recipe
called "Caribbean Creams."

37:27.039 --> 37:28.374
I named it for her breasts

37:28.457 --> 37:31.669
when she took off her bikini top one time
in Turks and Caicos.

37:31.752 --> 37:32.878
-[all laughing]
-Chi! Chi! Chi!

37:32.961 --> 37:34.422
Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi!

37:34.505 --> 37:36.674
Isn't it getting late?

37:37.383 --> 37:41.304
[chuckles] Yeah. She's right.
It's almost lights out.

37:41.387 --> 37:45.516
All right, well,
peace, J-Kizzle!

37:45.599 --> 37:47.351
[all laughing]

37:47.435 --> 37:48.519
[speaking Italian]

37:48.602 --> 37:50.103
Hmm?

37:50.187 --> 37:52.565
Okay, I have no idea what that means.

37:52.648 --> 37:55.401
But it's classy.
Later, girlfriend.

37:55.484 --> 37:56.985
[chuckling]

37:59.405 --> 38:02.700
Lotta people hanging out here
all of a sudden.

38:02.783 --> 38:04.743
Yeah, well, it's nice to have friends.

38:04.827 --> 38:06.829
We are social animals, after all.

38:06.912 --> 38:12.125
It's just, we've got...
some nice stuff in here.

38:12.209 --> 38:15.338
Aren't you worrying about... stealing?

38:15.421 --> 38:17.172
What, is that because they're blacks?

38:18.131 --> 38:19.800
Of course not.

38:19.883 --> 38:21.969
It's because they're in prison.

38:22.052 --> 38:24.597
Stealing is what people do here.

38:24.680 --> 38:26.432
And because they're poor.

38:26.515 --> 38:29.142
Now, I think you're getting
a bit paranoid, Jonesy.

38:29.226 --> 38:31.269
I'm telling it like it is.

38:31.354 --> 38:34.064
And so what if they do steal?

38:34.147 --> 38:37.485
[scoffs] MCC has given us all this stuff,

38:37.568 --> 38:40.363
it's not as if we deserve it any more
than anybody else out there.

38:40.446 --> 38:43.616
Exactly when did you
turn into Abbie Hoffman?

38:43.699 --> 38:45.659
-[scoffs]
-You're as capitalist as they come.

38:45.743 --> 38:48.621
Oh, I'm sorry, but this...

38:48.704 --> 38:50.789
[chuckling] is not capitalism.

38:53.125 --> 38:55.002
[inmates chatting indistinctly]

38:55.085 --> 38:57.170
[woman speaking indistinctly
on walkie-talkie]

38:58.506 --> 39:00.048
[fan whirring]

39:01.675 --> 39:03.886
[chuckles] Now we're talking.

39:05.137 --> 39:06.179
[chuckles]

39:07.431 --> 39:10.017
I blew out all my commissary money.

39:10.100 --> 39:12.895
Figured you could use it
when it gets all stank in here.

39:14.688 --> 39:15.773
Thank you.

39:17.107 --> 39:18.275
For real.

39:19.860 --> 39:21.695
What about you, huh?

39:21.779 --> 39:23.155
You gonna be okay out there?

39:23.238 --> 39:24.865
[sighs]

39:26.241 --> 39:27.701
I have my doubts.

39:28.369 --> 39:30.621
Come on.
You're like a cockroach, Diaz.

39:30.704 --> 39:33.248
When we're all dead, you still gonna
be crawling around the garbage,

39:33.331 --> 39:35.125
saying mean shit to the other roaches.

39:42.007 --> 39:43.759
I gotta ask you a favor.

39:45.803 --> 39:46.804
Dayanara.

39:47.513 --> 39:49.056
You know I'ma look out for her.

39:49.139 --> 39:50.849
Don't let her get into trouble.

39:50.933 --> 39:52.893
She's a good girl.

39:52.976 --> 39:55.062
All the shit she's been through.

39:55.145 --> 39:57.189
This place could change her, you know?

39:58.231 --> 39:59.692
Turn her cold and mean.

39:59.775 --> 40:01.819
I ain't gonna let that happen.

40:03.654 --> 40:05.739
And even when you feel like giving up.

40:07.157 --> 40:09.660
Don't let her see nothing
like that on your face.

40:10.994 --> 40:13.330
You gotta hold her up,
you hear me?

40:16.584 --> 40:18.210
She's your daughter now.

40:19.336 --> 40:20.671
Long as you're in here.

40:23.882 --> 40:26.176
[scoffs] Daughters.

40:31.682 --> 40:33.225
They're the fucking worst.

40:38.313 --> 40:39.982
[toilet flushing]

40:43.527 --> 40:46.113
[coughing]

41:05.883 --> 41:07.342
[chuckles]

41:07.425 --> 41:08.802
Well, look who it is.

41:11.179 --> 41:13.223
You're trying to get sent back to Max?

41:13.306 --> 41:17.435
Oh, my God.
Prison is prison, right?

41:17.520 --> 41:18.729
[inhaling deeply]

41:26.904 --> 41:28.739
What happened to you?

41:31.408 --> 41:34.537
You stole from me to buy drugs.

41:34.620 --> 41:38.123
[sighs] And we're off.

41:40.584 --> 41:41.710
Yeah, okay.

41:43.253 --> 41:44.755
No, go ahead.

41:47.090 --> 41:49.802
Get all up in my eyeballs with your...

41:49.885 --> 41:52.345
fucking angry Brando impression, okay?

41:53.806 --> 41:57.059
Uh... call me a loser.

41:58.310 --> 42:01.814
[groans] Cut me off from the family.

42:02.565 --> 42:03.899
[softly] All right.

42:04.900 --> 42:06.151
Whatever you wanna do.

42:10.197 --> 42:11.489
[sobbing]

42:12.407 --> 42:13.534
I failed you.

42:13.617 --> 42:15.035
[softly] Holy shit.

42:15.118 --> 42:17.788
[continues sobbing]

42:17.871 --> 42:19.998
I should have been watching.

42:20.082 --> 42:22.918
I should have known you were in trouble.

42:23.001 --> 42:25.170
And then you got taken away,
and now...

42:25.253 --> 42:27.339
Please, just don't cry, Red.

42:27.422 --> 42:28.799
Look at you.

42:28.882 --> 42:31.552
-You look like you're dead already.
-[sighs]

42:33.887 --> 42:34.930
[Red sniffles]

42:35.013 --> 42:37.349
It was always hopeless.
[chuckles]

42:41.436 --> 42:44.022
I am not your fault.

42:44.106 --> 42:45.398
Well, I played tough with Tricia,

42:45.482 --> 42:48.944
and now she's in the prison cemetery
with her name spelled wrong.

42:49.027 --> 42:51.446
[sobbing]

42:51.529 --> 42:54.032
Tell me what to do, Nicky.
[sniffles]

42:54.116 --> 42:55.701
I don't know what to do!

43:00.664 --> 43:02.457
[both crying]

43:02.540 --> 43:04.334
[inmates talking indistinctly]

43:07.254 --> 43:08.839
[Blanca] Hmm, what is that? Oysters?

43:14.052 --> 43:15.345
Want one?

43:23.353 --> 43:24.396
[sniffs]

43:29.484 --> 43:31.236
[Blanca panting]

43:38.702 --> 43:39.870
[grunting]

43:56.804 --> 43:58.346
[grunting continues]

44:04.687 --> 44:05.771
[laughing]

44:08.649 --> 44:10.025
[moans loudly]

44:11.026 --> 44:12.820
[inmates talking indistinctly]

44:14.697 --> 44:16.949
Hey.
No touching.

44:17.032 --> 44:18.659
Oh, okay.

44:18.742 --> 44:22.663
But be sure to let Mr. Caputo know
that we were touching.

44:22.746 --> 44:24.081
Mmm-hmm.

44:24.164 --> 44:27.334
Eh, so what's gonna happen when your
<i>Dukes of Hazzard-</i> lovin' cracker fans

44:27.417 --> 44:28.669
-see that photo?
-[chuckles]

44:28.752 --> 44:31.254
Ooh, their Frito pie gonna fall
right outta they mouths.

44:31.338 --> 44:32.756
I'll say, "Sorry 'bout that."

44:32.840 --> 44:34.466
-And that's it?
-Mmm, pretty much.

44:34.549 --> 44:36.509
You know, you can cheat
on your wife with hookers

44:36.593 --> 44:38.762
who indulge you in your diaper fetish

44:38.846 --> 44:42.557
and still be the senator from Louisiana,
so long as you apologize.

44:42.640 --> 44:45.227
See, that is the great thing
about the love of Jesus.

44:45.310 --> 44:49.522
Oh, no, don't you start with me about
that holy white evangelical bullshit.

44:49.606 --> 44:50.941
They a buncha hypocrites.

44:51.024 --> 44:55.153
Killing science and education and refusin'
to marry the nice gay couples,

44:55.237 --> 44:59.992
but then bein' all "rah-rah the Holy Land"
when they really think...

45:00.075 --> 45:03.286
that my people got horns
and that we all gonna broil in hell.

45:04.579 --> 45:08.041
Oh. Oh, wait. Hold up.
You're Jewish?

45:09.542 --> 45:12.755
I cannot believe that those posers
just smoked us

45:12.838 --> 45:15.465
on the unspoken,
interracial, prison couple power ranking.

45:15.548 --> 45:18.927
[chuckles] Well, we ain't
about competition, all right?

45:19.011 --> 45:21.304
We just doin' our thing.
Our real thing.

45:21.388 --> 45:22.514
I know.

45:22.597 --> 45:24.391
I'm not trying to sell us short
or anything,

45:24.474 --> 45:28.854
but it's like they're Beyoncé and Jay Z
and we're just Kim and Kanye.

45:28.937 --> 45:31.606
Yo, that hurts.
I ain't gonna lie.

45:31.689 --> 45:34.234
[Angie] It's like, about
this super-nerdy teacher,

45:34.317 --> 45:37.737
and, um, he finds out
he has, like, terminal cancer.

45:37.821 --> 45:42.159
And so he starts making meth
to make money for his family.

45:42.242 --> 45:43.243
But... [stuttering]

45:43.326 --> 45:45.578
Except, he dyes it blue
for some reason.

45:45.662 --> 45:47.790
No, I would never do blue meth.

45:47.873 --> 45:50.167
That color ain't natural.

45:50.250 --> 45:51.418
So what happens?

45:52.460 --> 45:54.254
I'm guessing it goes wrong somehow.

45:55.130 --> 45:59.217
Man, we're missing out on all the best TV.

45:59.301 --> 46:01.094
I swear,
I mighta cleaned up my act

46:01.178 --> 46:03.596
if I knew I was gonna end up
in a place with only network.

46:03.680 --> 46:06.892
Well, we got some basic cable.
Like that show with the lawyers on USA.

46:06.975 --> 46:09.144
Are they lawyers or are they FBI guys?

46:09.227 --> 46:11.063
The FBI guys were in Miami--

46:11.146 --> 46:12.940
Uh, that's not Miami,
it's Long Island.

46:13.023 --> 46:16.776
Mmm-mmm. He's a doctor...
or maybe CIA.

46:16.860 --> 46:17.861
So nobody's a lawyer?

46:17.945 --> 46:20.363
No, there are lawyers, for sure.

46:20.447 --> 46:22.532
Man, I thought that was
just one long show.

46:23.533 --> 46:24.868
[Leanne and Angie chuckle]

46:24.952 --> 46:28.997
Well, look who's not too good
to knock trays with us hill trolls.

46:29.706 --> 46:31.541
Got tired of your butchy girlfriend?

46:33.001 --> 46:34.336
She ain't my girlfriend.

46:35.170 --> 46:36.338
Suit yourself.

46:37.214 --> 46:39.091
[Digori grunts] I heard
that there is this show

46:39.174 --> 46:41.426
that was like,
just people shooting zombies.

46:41.509 --> 46:43.053
Yo, yo.
You gotta check this.

46:45.889 --> 46:46.974
[speaking indistinctly]

46:47.057 --> 46:48.475
[both chuckling]

46:50.853 --> 46:52.020
[groans]

47:09.412 --> 47:11.915
Listen, if your mind is starting to go,
just tell me

47:11.999 --> 47:14.376
and I'll mercy break your neck,
so you don't end up in Psych.

47:14.459 --> 47:16.503
You told me Crystal's case was stalled

47:16.586 --> 47:19.131
because we couldn't prove
that Sophia's in the SHU.

47:19.214 --> 47:20.673
And you think you could prove that?

47:20.757 --> 47:23.510
I know it's all isolation down there.

47:23.593 --> 47:26.388
But there's a shower facility, right?

47:26.471 --> 47:28.723
One that everyone uses
at one time or another.

47:28.806 --> 47:32.144
-If I can get word to her--
-I mean, I'm half-Catholic myself,

47:32.227 --> 47:34.271
but what you're talking about
is a kinda miracle.

47:34.354 --> 47:38.108
I have a phone.
With a camera.

47:38.191 --> 47:40.027
In a very uncomfortable place.

47:41.194 --> 47:43.821
[scoffs] You are one crazy bitch.

47:45.240 --> 47:46.491
Thank you, Mendoza.

47:47.617 --> 47:49.702
[sighs] I'm pretty scared,
to be honest.

47:49.786 --> 47:51.579
The SHU's a scary place.

47:53.415 --> 47:56.209
You wanna get sent down there,
you can't be pulling this piddly shit.

47:56.293 --> 47:58.336
-You gotta do something serious.
-I know.

47:58.420 --> 48:00.880
It's just that,
I don't want to hurt anybody, you know?

48:00.964 --> 48:04.342
I was an activist,
but always non-violent.

48:04.426 --> 48:06.594
Sometimes you gotta think
about the greater good.

48:13.018 --> 48:14.937
-[grunts]
-Oh! Shit!

48:16.271 --> 48:17.897
Good for you.

48:17.981 --> 48:20.400
Ow! Ow!

48:20.483 --> 48:22.527
Tell me I didn't see
what I just saw.

48:22.610 --> 48:25.113
No, this monster almost
broke my jaw, Officer.

48:25.197 --> 48:27.699
And I'd do it again, Latino!

48:27.782 --> 48:30.077
-[inmates gasp]
-Oh! Hell, no!

48:30.160 --> 48:34.164
You need to get her outta here
'cause she is a threat to our safety!

48:35.082 --> 48:36.749
Oh! [groaning]

48:36.833 --> 48:37.875
Shit!

48:39.044 --> 48:40.295
Let's go, Ingalls.

48:41.838 --> 48:43.756
[inmates cheering]

48:49.554 --> 48:51.681
Here you go. [grunts]

48:54.142 --> 48:56.019
I am pleasantly surprised.

48:56.561 --> 48:57.562
Yeah, I, uh...

48:57.645 --> 48:59.731
I took the liberty of looking through them
for that crazy photo,

48:59.814 --> 49:00.940
but, uh, they're clean.

49:01.941 --> 49:03.401
Well, not clean.

49:03.485 --> 49:07.364
There's some gnarly snaps,
but, uh, not the one we're looking for.

49:07.447 --> 49:08.490
[inhales deeply]

49:08.573 --> 49:11.326
So, I guess some things
will always be a mystery.

49:13.661 --> 49:17.290
Hey, what's your background,
CO Luschek?

49:18.375 --> 49:21.794
Uh... mostly Scottish.

49:21.878 --> 49:25.007
Some French fur traders, way back.

49:25.090 --> 49:28.010
No, I mean,
how did you end up here?

49:28.093 --> 49:31.179
Oh, uh, you know, attrition.

49:31.263 --> 49:33.640
It's just... [sighs]

49:33.723 --> 49:36.434
you should so clearly
be working at a GameStop.

49:40.647 --> 49:42.857
[man speaking indistinctly on PA]

49:47.445 --> 49:50.907
Whoa! Are you for real, Flores?
The fuck did I tell you?

49:50.990 --> 49:53.243
Oh, man,
I don't remember.

49:58.331 --> 49:59.666
Get on it.

49:59.749 --> 50:00.875
[in Spanish] What am I, a goat?

50:00.958 --> 50:02.377
I said get up on the table, inmate!

50:08.007 --> 50:09.301
Now, you're gonna stand there

50:09.384 --> 50:11.761
and you're gonna think about
all the decisions that you've been making.

50:11.844 --> 50:13.763
[in English] Does that mean
I don't have to go back to work?

50:13.846 --> 50:15.682
No, you're not going anywhere.

50:15.765 --> 50:17.225
Your job is to stand...

50:17.309 --> 50:18.518
-[slams table]
-...on this table,

50:18.601 --> 50:21.063
until you're ready to quit
dicking me around!

50:21.146 --> 50:23.315
[in Spanish] Well, dude...
that could be a while.

50:23.398 --> 50:25.567
Call me all the Spanish names
you want, <i>mami.</i>

50:25.650 --> 50:27.485
We'll see how you feel
when your knees start to give.

50:47.046 --> 50:48.256
Morning.

50:50.092 --> 50:51.509
Coffee.

50:53.010 --> 50:54.262
Careful, it's hot.

50:55.012 --> 50:56.431
I microwaved it.

51:02.395 --> 51:03.688
[sighs]

51:06.524 --> 51:07.775
Problem?

51:07.859 --> 51:09.194
No, no.

51:09.277 --> 51:11.696
Good.
Let's get dressed.

51:14.031 --> 51:15.867
-[door creaking]
-Hmm, let's see.

51:18.453 --> 51:20.663
Maybe... pink today?

51:21.581 --> 51:23.082
Yes?

51:24.041 --> 51:25.210
Mmm-hmm.

51:27.170 --> 51:28.255
[sighs]

51:35.178 --> 51:36.263
Hey, Ramos.

51:37.222 --> 51:38.431
I have something for you.

51:38.515 --> 51:41.058
No, thanks.
I'm cool.

51:41.143 --> 51:42.435
Come in for a minute.

51:42.519 --> 51:44.271
I gotta be back at the warehouse

51:44.354 --> 51:46.189
to get some towels and stuff
for down the hill.

51:50.402 --> 51:52.154
[breathing heavily]

52:19.931 --> 52:21.516
[Humphrey] It's your game.

52:21.599 --> 52:24.269
The one you were talking
about with your friend.

52:24.352 --> 52:25.603
I thought we could play.

52:26.646 --> 52:29.857
-This is disgusting.
-You're the one who made it up.

52:29.941 --> 52:32.109
-I thought you'd get a kick out of it--
-Well, I don't.

52:35.572 --> 52:36.989
[Humphrey] You gotta pick one.

52:39.659 --> 52:40.952
You can't make me do this.

52:41.953 --> 52:43.788
I think you're forgetting your situation.

52:44.414 --> 52:47.124
My situation is,
you don't got nothing on me now.

52:47.209 --> 52:49.001
Look around,
you're not gonna find one thing.

52:53.465 --> 52:55.300
-[gun cocks]
-[gasping]

52:57.051 --> 52:58.761
-Gun to your head.
-[gasps]

53:00.722 --> 53:02.139
[sobbing]

53:13.985 --> 53:17.530
It might not be Shake Shack,
but it's 100% guilt-free.

53:18.573 --> 53:22.076
Here's to the off-brand
Spam sandwich of righteousness.

53:22.827 --> 53:24.371
Cheers.

53:32.462 --> 53:35.757
You know what?
Fuck righteousness.

53:35.840 --> 53:37.925
You make a valid point.

53:40.094 --> 53:41.220
Mmm.

53:49.437 --> 53:50.938
Uh, so here's the thing.

53:52.023 --> 53:53.733
I'm gonna get clean.

54:01.491 --> 54:02.700
Okay.

54:05.495 --> 54:08.581
[inmates yelling indistinctly]

54:13.503 --> 54:15.672
[woman speaking indistinctly
on walkie-talkie]

54:25.264 --> 54:26.516
[inmate yelling]

54:37.276 --> 54:39.236
[inmates chatting indistinctly]

54:41.656 --> 54:45.785
I mean, sure.
It's a little Abu Ghraib-y...

54:46.869 --> 54:48.580
but... sure.

54:49.664 --> 54:52.124
Just came to me.
Spur of the moment-like.

54:53.501 --> 54:54.961
We're gonna have to
ride this out now.

54:55.044 --> 54:56.087
For how long?

54:56.170 --> 54:57.672
Until she promises to behave.

54:57.755 --> 55:00.216
Look, I give it till dinner time, tops.

55:03.845 --> 55:05.179
I don't know, dude.

55:06.806 --> 55:08.933
I feel like you mighta made a mistake.

55:13.896 --> 55:15.565
