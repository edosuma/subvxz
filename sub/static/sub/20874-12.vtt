00:12.771 --> 00:15.472
D now, bam!

00:16.041 --> 00:18.425
This season on Million Dollar
Listing New York.

00:18.502 --> 00:19.502
Sh...!

00:19.544 --> 00:22.012
Dude this looks so
f... ing good!

00:22.047 --> 00:23.138
It's 100 feet long.

00:23.215 --> 00:24.681
That's what all the
men say to me.

00:24.716 --> 00:26.349
Hold on a second, take
your pants off!

00:26.384 --> 00:29.186
My God!

00:29.221 --> 00:30.687
What are you thinking on price?

00:30.722 --> 00:31.480
17point5.

00:31.556 --> 00:32.272
16 million.

00:32.348 --> 00:33.273
400 million.

00:33.350 --> 00:34.091
Yes!

00:34.126 --> 00:34.775
You have yourself a deal.

00:34.851 --> 00:35.650
I knew it.

00:35.727 --> 00:36.727
Congratulations.

00:38.063 --> 00:39.654
Yes!

00:41.876 --> 00:44.117
You want me to sell
a house like every other day.

00:44.194 --> 00:45.102
That's what you're
getting paid for.

00:45.137 --> 00:47.037
Why are you crying over
this sh... bro?

00:47.048 --> 00:48.266
If this was just
some kind of dupe

00:48.290 --> 00:50.490
to get us in the door, we're
gonna have to go elsewhere.

00:51.576 --> 00:52.667
Luis!

00:52.744 --> 00:54.336
This is like the old times!

00:54.412 --> 00:55.712
I am moving to Paris.

00:55.747 --> 00:57.225
What you're saying doesn't
make any sense.

00:57.249 --> 00:58.799
You have to have a plan.

00:58.875 --> 01:00.300
Don't leave.

01:00.377 --> 01:02.844
So babe, it's that time again.

01:02.921 --> 01:03.720
The embryos.

01:03.755 --> 01:05.639
I'm just gonna let go
of control.

01:05.715 --> 01:08.058
I want to launch in Paris.

01:08.093 --> 01:11.353
I haven't been to Paris since
my old modeling days.

01:11.429 --> 01:12.488
Paris! Yes!

01:15.910 --> 01:17.159
Yeah?

01:19.604 --> 01:22.572
It's a little difficult
working with other brokers.

01:22.607 --> 01:24.866
'Cause you like to be in
control of everything.

01:24.943 --> 01:28.411
I want to kind of pass the
project onto you.

01:28.446 --> 01:30.383
There's just things that I have
to really figure out.

01:30.407 --> 01:34.167
It feels like something's
missing.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.089
I'm a real estate angel.

01:39.100 --> 01:42.551
Everything I touch,
turns to sold.

01:42.627 --> 01:44.761
New York City, it's
all about style.

01:44.796 --> 01:48.223
My business is about
performing, not conforming.

01:48.300 --> 01:49.683
I'm married now, but my business

01:49.759 --> 01:51.226
motto will never change.

01:51.303 --> 01:52.102
Expansion.

01:52.113 --> 01:54.271
Always in all ways.

01:54.306 --> 01:55.616
It's not shady. It's very shady.

01:55.640 --> 01:56.523
It's business, Fredrik.

01:56.600 --> 01:57.941
It's my developer!

01:57.976 --> 02:00.869
When did you become
such a whiner.

02:09.321 --> 02:10.287
Am I in drive?

02:10.322 --> 02:13.373
Yes, I'm in drive.

02:13.450 --> 02:15.250
It's such a different
experience.

02:15.327 --> 02:19.212
I am driving because Yuriy
is on vacation.

02:19.289 --> 02:21.464
Here we go. Great.

02:21.499 --> 02:23.633
I am very-I'm okay with it.

02:29.174 --> 02:31.308
I'm not okay with it.

02:31.318 --> 02:32.820
Hey sweater vest, why don't
you ride your bike

02:32.844 --> 02:34.769
in the actual bike lane?

02:34.846 --> 02:36.646
That's why they have bike lanes!

02:36.681 --> 02:38.148
There's so many people!

02:38.183 --> 02:40.617
Get out of my way!

02:42.830 --> 02:44.446
Did I just go through
a red light?

02:44.522 --> 02:47.782
Driving in New York City...

02:47.859 --> 02:49.826
is for sadomasochists.

02:49.861 --> 02:52.412
Yuriy is never going away
on vacation ever again.

02:54.532 --> 02:56.592
This is Ryan.

02:58.495 --> 03:01.680
Hey Chuck, how are you?

03:07.879 --> 03:09.813
For-for what? 47th Street?

03:11.841 --> 03:14.351
47th Street is my
newest listing.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.436
It's a smaller apartment
in midtown.

03:16.513 --> 03:20.407
And it's priced at two and a
quarter million dollars.

03:22.394 --> 03:24.319
It just sounds so small.

03:24.396 --> 03:26.029
I've been feeling stuck
on work recently.

03:26.064 --> 03:28.990
Kind of like everyday is
Groundhog's Day.

03:29.067 --> 03:32.118
I went and saw my therapist,
who told me to take a step back.

03:32.195 --> 03:33.453
How does it feel?

03:33.530 --> 03:34.704
Weird as sh...

03:34.715 --> 03:36.831
This is not even you,
you love to work.

03:36.908 --> 03:39.167
Maybe you just need
a little reset.

03:39.244 --> 03:41.795
So I decided to take on
a smaller listing.

03:41.871 --> 03:44.047
And I'm glad I did
because the seller,

03:44.058 --> 03:46.174
John is actually really fun.

03:46.251 --> 03:48.969
This is a party bathroom,
use your imagination.

03:49.045 --> 03:51.721
Even if he wants
more money than any other

03:51.756 --> 03:54.891
comparable sell in the
building in the history of ever.

03:54.926 --> 03:56.476
What?

03:56.553 --> 03:58.561
Also, John's the one who
secretly took

03:58.572 --> 04:00.647
out all the furniture and
didn't even tell me.

04:00.724 --> 04:03.200
And that makes it kind of
hard to get over ask.

04:06.104 --> 04:07.570
That's a full ask offer.

04:07.605 --> 04:08.571
Good work.

04:08.606 --> 04:10.156
Send it over to me and
I'll present it.

04:10.233 --> 04:13.076
But the seller is looking for
over the asking price

04:13.111 --> 04:16.838
and we priced it
aggressively to get more.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.648
I will submit it and I will
keep you posted.

04:24.247 --> 04:25.755
All right, see ya.

04:26.958 --> 04:28.091
Hello?

04:28.126 --> 04:30.176
Ryan!

04:30.253 --> 04:32.980
Hey! How you doing?

04:35.467 --> 04:36.467
Yep.

04:38.803 --> 04:39.728
I'm turning 40.

04:39.804 --> 04:41.282
So if I did something,
would you come?

04:41.306 --> 04:42.306
Of course.

04:43.617 --> 04:46.535
Where are we going for
your birthday?

04:49.481 --> 04:50.613
Paris, France?

04:50.648 --> 04:52.407
Yes!

04:52.484 --> 04:54.409
Really? Really?

04:54.486 --> 04:56.953
Like when people ask me to go
to the Upper West Side

04:56.988 --> 05:00.882
for a birthday party,
I really have to think about it.

05:02.952 --> 05:03.952
Got it.

05:07.165 --> 05:09.299
Got it, lucky number 40.

05:09.334 --> 05:11.968
When I'm your age I'll have
to do something special

05:12.003 --> 05:14.471
too but that's so far from now.

05:14.481 --> 05:15.388
All right, I'll check with her.

05:15.465 --> 05:17.807
I'll get back to you.

05:17.818 --> 05:18.859
All right. Bye.

05:20.637 --> 05:22.437
Paris.

05:22.514 --> 05:25.940
I can't go to Paris, I can't
even get across 10th Avenue.

05:26.017 --> 05:27.017
Let's go!

05:38.988 --> 05:40.288
I love Paris.

05:40.365 --> 05:41.831
I mean there is no better place

05:41.866 --> 05:44.417
for me to celebrate my
40th birthday.

05:44.494 --> 05:46.920
However, there's not going
to be any celebration

05:46.996 --> 05:48.349
if I don't get the sales
that I need

05:48.373 --> 05:51.433
for my new project, 75 Kenmare.

05:52.377 --> 05:54.302
We are priced rich.

05:54.379 --> 05:55.557
We got to do something
different.

05:55.581 --> 06:00.183
If I send you to Paris, I
want you to get 25% sold.

06:00.218 --> 06:01.017
Fredrik?

06:01.052 --> 06:02.268
Yes, hi love. How are you?

06:02.345 --> 06:04.354
I'm really excited,
they're all waiting.

06:04.389 --> 06:05.355
They're outside?

06:05.390 --> 06:06.523
They're outside.

06:06.558 --> 06:08.191
As soon as I landed,
I started texting,

06:08.202 --> 06:11.027
calling, emailing, every
Parisian broker.

06:11.062 --> 06:12.062
It's me, Fredrik.

06:12.373 --> 06:13.488
There's a huge party.

06:13.565 --> 06:14.447
Yes!

06:14.524 --> 06:15.524
Okay, I'll see you there.

06:15.567 --> 06:17.534
The problem is, I did too good.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.160
I mean it was a hot mess.

06:19.237 --> 06:22.872
I got 1,000 RSVPs.

06:22.907 --> 06:24.347
When you have a new
building designed

06:24.409 --> 06:26.543
by a celebrity like
Lenny Kravitz,

06:26.578 --> 06:28.044
the issue is that
a lot of people

06:28.079 --> 06:30.046
might just want to
attend the party

06:30.081 --> 06:32.006
without even wanting to buy.

06:32.083 --> 06:35.802
So I did something completely
crazy and very last minute.

06:35.879 --> 06:39.889
But what I think was smart,
I cancelled everything.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.402
This is what we're going to do,
call Knight Frank,

06:41.426 --> 06:42.892
just disinvite everybody.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.687
I cancelled the entire
party, the venue.

06:45.763 --> 06:49.816
And instead invited only
the top, top, top,

06:49.893 --> 06:52.318
top VIP brokers.

06:52.395 --> 06:54.863
Welcome! Hello! Fredrik Eklund,
good to meet you.

06:54.939 --> 06:55.738
Hi, hi. >> Nice to meet you.

06:55.749 --> 06:56.656
Hi gorgeous.

06:56.733 --> 06:57.657
Hi handsome.

06:57.734 --> 06:59.909
These aren't just
top executives from Paris.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.744
These are top
executives from Monaco,

07:01.755 --> 07:03.538
Warsaw, London, from Moscow.

07:03.615 --> 07:07.041
They have the richest clients
in the world,

07:07.118 --> 07:08.135
trust me on this one.

07:08.620 --> 07:12.088
First of all, I wanted to
congratulate all of you

07:12.123 --> 07:15.008
because there were a lot
of people that wanted come here.

07:15.084 --> 07:17.427
This is a very, very
special project

07:17.462 --> 07:19.813
that I worked on for years.

07:20.465 --> 07:22.098
It's located in NoLita.

07:22.133 --> 07:25.185
The facade is designed by
Kikoski,

07:25.261 --> 07:26.769
he recently worked at the
Guggenheim Museum.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.188
And then of course,
the interiors

07:28.264 --> 07:30.231
is Mr. Kravitz himself.

07:30.308 --> 07:31.508
It's very artsy.

07:31.543 --> 07:32.775
If you look at the finishes,
if you look at the kitchen,

07:32.786 --> 07:34.736
the bathroom, they're gorgeous.

07:34.812 --> 07:37.280
The stone, the wood, you
know the big ceiling heights,

07:37.291 --> 07:39.699
the beautiful big windows.

07:39.776 --> 07:41.242
We have a 24hour doorman.

07:41.319 --> 07:43.536
We have a beautiful gym,
we have a beautiful roof deck.

07:43.613 --> 07:46.206
But best of all, parking.

07:46.282 --> 07:49.584
Parking spaces in New York, they
go to a million dollars each.

07:49.661 --> 07:52.378
Here, 165 parking spots.

07:52.455 --> 07:55.798
1.7 million, you get
a beautiful one bedroom

07:55.809 --> 07:58.384
and then it goes up
to 15.5 million

07:58.461 --> 08:00.937
for the top penthouse
which is massive.

08:02.173 --> 08:04.224
What's the delivery time
on these units?

08:04.300 --> 08:07.727
We're looking between 16
to 20 months right now.

08:07.804 --> 08:08.745
Interesting.

08:08.747 --> 08:10.313
And what's the price
per square foot?

08:10.348 --> 08:11.314
We range.

08:11.349 --> 08:13.274
We start around 26, 2700 a foot

08:13.351 --> 08:15.151
and up to 5,000 for
the penthouse.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.444
5,000 per square foot,

08:16.521 --> 08:18.488
that's quite expensive for
New York isn't it?

08:18.523 --> 08:20.323
I mean if you want to
buy the best,

08:20.358 --> 08:22.242
have the best investment,
live in the best area,

08:22.318 --> 08:24.118
the best building,
best amenities,

08:24.195 --> 08:25.475
you're gonna have to pay for it.

08:28.366 --> 08:29.832
She likes storage,
she has a lot of clothing,

08:29.843 --> 08:31.751
may be she's like a beautiful-

08:31.828 --> 08:32.828
Hi how are you?

08:32.870 --> 08:33.461
Excuse me.

08:33.538 --> 08:34.294
Can I talk to you?

08:34.371 --> 08:35.462
Right now? Sure.

08:35.539 --> 08:36.798
How's it going?

08:36.874 --> 08:38.006
I think it's really good.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.509
I'm getting a lot of
good feedback.

08:39.544 --> 08:41.020
This is so small,
I thought you said

08:41.044 --> 08:42.345
there were gonna be
100 people here.

08:42.356 --> 08:45.014
Well to get a sale, you have
to get people excited.

08:45.049 --> 08:46.015
We're going through
all this trouble

08:46.050 --> 08:47.684
to have hundreds of people here.

08:47.719 --> 08:48.851
I hope this is going to work.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.019
Let me clarify something.

08:50.030 --> 08:53.356
In this room, there's actually
30,000 brokers.

08:53.367 --> 08:57.026
Like him right here, he has a
team, he runs an office.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.872
He's going to write an
email to all the employees

08:58.896 --> 09:00.446
saying, "My God this building."

09:00.523 --> 09:02.163
But I need to be with him
to convince him.

09:02.191 --> 09:03.658
Okay listen, go sell then.

09:03.735 --> 09:06.002
Okay well you go there,
I go this way.

09:06.571 --> 09:09.497
Anyway, what I was saying
to you guys is there is no other

09:09.574 --> 09:11.541
building like this and
you have to be fast.

09:11.576 --> 09:13.543
I still think it was the
right decision

09:13.578 --> 09:16.212
to make this launch
smaller in Paris.

09:16.247 --> 09:20.383
Now he wants me to sell
25% of the building.

09:20.418 --> 09:23.052
That's nine units out of
the thirtyeight,

09:23.087 --> 09:24.512
in less than a week.

09:24.589 --> 09:26.723
If I don't get the sales
that I need,

09:26.733 --> 09:27.901
then he's gonna look
at me and say,

09:27.925 --> 09:29.225
"You made the wrong decision."

09:29.260 --> 09:30.727
All fingers are going to
be pointing at me

09:30.737 --> 09:32.645
so I have to make those sales.

09:32.722 --> 09:35.699
I just have to, there is
no other way.

09:37.602 --> 09:38.234
Coming up.

09:38.269 --> 09:39.736
You're taking a risk.

09:39.771 --> 09:41.070
You might lose these people.

09:41.105 --> 09:43.164
I'm willing to take the risk.

09:43.417 --> 09:44.240
Papi!

09:44.275 --> 09:45.199
Luis?

09:45.276 --> 09:46.075
There he is!

09:46.086 --> 09:47.502
Did you miss New York?

10:02.436 --> 10:05.178
Bienvenue à Paris.

10:05.254 --> 10:07.513
It's amazing to be back in
this beautiful city.

10:07.590 --> 10:10.266
I have all these old places
I want to revisit,

10:10.277 --> 10:12.694
but let's first get down
to business.

10:14.472 --> 10:15.396
It's a good market.

10:15.473 --> 10:16.773
It's not as it used to be

10:16.808 --> 10:19.275
where everything
flew off the shelf.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.444
But as a really good deal maker,

10:21.479 --> 10:22.612
there's product out there,

10:22.623 --> 10:23.613
there's buyers,
all I need to do is

10:23.624 --> 10:25.206
connect the dots, that's my job.

10:27.628 --> 10:28.451
Steve.

10:28.486 --> 10:29.118
Steve came!

10:29.153 --> 10:30.203
What's up?

10:30.279 --> 10:31.454
When did you arrive?

10:31.489 --> 10:33.623
I mean I knew he said he
was gonna come but I,

10:33.658 --> 10:35.875
I didn't think he was
actually going to come to Paris.

10:35.952 --> 10:37.418
Looks amazing. >> Yes.

10:37.495 --> 10:38.544
As I knew it would.

10:38.621 --> 10:41.381
I always say it's much better
to do curated selection.

10:41.457 --> 10:42.131
Yes.

10:42.166 --> 10:43.065
I'm so happy you say that

10:43.067 --> 10:44.759
because I want only
the top people.

10:44.836 --> 10:47.145
That's why I travelled all
the way here for you.

10:47.839 --> 10:49.055
That's a lot of hair.

10:49.132 --> 10:51.140
I forgot my tie in customs,
they took it.

10:51.175 --> 10:51.974
They didn't.

10:52.009 --> 10:52.842
Yeah.

10:52.878 --> 10:54.778
Honey, they did not
take your tie.

10:55.179 --> 10:57.614
Honestly, I don't think
Steve Gold owns any ties.

10:59.350 --> 11:00.983
This is one of my favorites,
the FLine.

11:01.018 --> 11:01.984
What's the difference
between three,

11:02.019 --> 11:03.152
four and five on this?

11:03.187 --> 11:03.903
200,000.

11:03.980 --> 11:05.054
Each floor? >>

11:05.089 --> 11:07.240
It's so beautiful because
it's a double corner.

11:07.316 --> 11:08.958
You see the
Empire State Building.

11:09.527 --> 11:10.426
That's sick.

11:10.428 --> 11:13.663
My buyer, he's a
young finance guy.

11:13.698 --> 11:16.332
He's lived in NoLita the
last four years, been renting.

11:16.367 --> 11:17.917
So he fits perfectly in
this building.

11:17.994 --> 11:21.462
Designed by Lenny Kravtiz,
sexy, there's a garage.

11:21.539 --> 11:23.339
When you get me an offer,
let's have lunch.

11:23.374 --> 11:25.144
Send it to my hotel, and
I'll look at it tonight.

11:25.168 --> 11:26.843
Okay everyone's here,
talk around.

11:26.878 --> 11:27.577
I'm gonna mingle.

11:27.579 --> 11:29.178
That's Dan, my developer.

11:29.213 --> 11:29.846
I'll say hello.

11:29.881 --> 11:30.413
Okay cool.

11:30.448 --> 11:31.347
I'm glad you came!

11:31.382 --> 11:32.140
I'm happy for you, man.

11:32.216 --> 11:33.274
Thanks. >> All right.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.143
Hello.

11:35.219 --> 11:36.218
How are you? Steve Gold.

11:36.220 --> 11:37.687
Hey nice to see you.
Dan, nice to see you.

11:37.698 --> 11:38.688
The project looks great.

11:38.699 --> 11:39.856
Thank you, yeah.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.034
I'm really excited
about this one.

11:41.058 --> 11:42.698
I actually came all the
way from New York.

11:42.727 --> 11:43.829
It's something I really
believe in,

11:43.853 --> 11:45.027
I think you did a great job.

11:45.062 --> 11:46.362
I think Lenny did a great job.

11:46.397 --> 11:48.489
Do you think
we pitched it right?

11:48.566 --> 11:50.366
I think Fredrik's doing
an excellent job.

11:50.401 --> 11:52.368
I've never worked with Dan
directly but you know,

11:52.403 --> 11:53.881
he's a pretty big
developer in the city.

11:53.905 --> 11:56.789
Has a lot of great projects
you know, with a lot

11:56.866 --> 11:58.510
of great build outs
and a really good reputation.

11:58.534 --> 12:01.169
Are you primarily building
downtown or are you-

12:01.245 --> 12:02.848
We'll go to any good
neighborhood in New York.

12:02.872 --> 12:04.964
Actually my next project is
on the upper West Side.

12:05.041 --> 12:06.215
Nice. >> Yeah.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.217
I have a huge listing
I bring on at 1 Riverside.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.886
Our site's on Broadway.

12:09.921 --> 12:11.231
I got a lot of clients,
you know,

12:11.255 --> 12:12.121
on the upper West Side.

12:12.156 --> 12:13.233
We should get lunch
sometime, maybe.

12:13.257 --> 12:13.806
You know?

12:13.883 --> 12:15.016
Okay.

12:15.092 --> 12:16.392
A terrace is everything.

12:16.427 --> 12:17.894
You want a terrace right?

12:17.904 --> 12:20.062
So I'll have my assistant
reach out to schedule a lunch.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.063
It was really great to meet you.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.064
All right, see you Dan.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.283
Thank you.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.127
How are you?

12:35.422 --> 12:37.079
I am basically on time.

12:37.114 --> 12:39.665
Showing John's place has been
super busy lately.

12:39.742 --> 12:43.544
I've done dozens of showings
to older buyers.

12:43.621 --> 12:45.087
It's in a nice residential part

12:45.098 --> 12:48.925
of the center of the
city, Midtown.

12:48.935 --> 12:51.853
I wonder if this is what it's
like in my Miami office.

12:52.630 --> 12:55.765
So I found a couple that really
likes the apartment.

12:55.800 --> 12:57.611
And I think you're going to
be very, very happy

12:57.635 --> 13:04.607
to know that they're making an
all cash, full ask offer.

13:04.642 --> 13:06.868
Two and a quarter, done.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.740
I'm pretty excited.

13:12.817 --> 13:16.619
The last time we had a
conversation about pricing,

13:16.654 --> 13:21.457
the ask was an incitement
to create interest.

13:21.492 --> 13:23.751
I want to attract the
most interest.

13:23.828 --> 13:25.127
Maybe we'll get a bidding war.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.295
Correct.

13:26.330 --> 13:28.050
I've been doing my best to
get a bidding war

13:28.124 --> 13:30.216
going as I said I would.

13:30.293 --> 13:31.478
I've been doing lots
of showings,

13:31.502 --> 13:32.980
I've been scouring the
entire city to find

13:33.004 --> 13:36.806
the perfect type of buyer,
especially an older buyer,

13:36.841 --> 13:39.976
which has brought me to
some very interesting locations.

13:42.680 --> 13:44.491
Have you ever thought
about moving into the city?

13:44.515 --> 13:47.275
I've shown the apartment
to a lot of people.

13:47.351 --> 13:48.985
And these people actually
thought the apartment

13:48.995 --> 13:50.987
was worth closer to two.

13:50.997 --> 13:54.490
And I had to beat them up to get
them to two and a quarter.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.242
If these people want
the apartment,

13:56.319 --> 13:57.994
they can have the apartment.

13:58.004 --> 14:02.590
All they have to do is write
a check for 2point4.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.335
It's hard negotiating
with older clients.

14:06.370 --> 14:08.754
When they walk to school
in eight miles of snow

14:08.831 --> 14:11.841
with like wolves and
giraffes chasing them.

14:11.852 --> 14:13.634
They don't want to hear excuses.

14:13.711 --> 14:16.596
This was supposed to be
the easy one,

14:16.672 --> 14:19.015
like the easy listing.

14:19.050 --> 14:21.517
You know, I was gonna have
some fun with it.

14:21.552 --> 14:22.602
That never happens!

14:22.678 --> 14:23.519
You know why?

14:23.554 --> 14:25.605
'Cause that's not real life!

14:25.681 --> 14:28.107
You're taking a risk because
we might lose these people

14:28.184 --> 14:31.027
and then we might
not get anyone else, ever.

14:31.037 --> 14:34.196
Well, here's how
I feel about risk.

14:34.207 --> 14:40.753
Risk has its rewards,
I'm willing to take the risk.

14:42.406 --> 14:44.165
Okay.

14:44.241 --> 14:45.833
You're right.

14:45.910 --> 14:47.376
Let me call them.

14:47.411 --> 14:51.339
Financially speaking, I don't
love John's decision.

14:51.415 --> 14:55.635
But I respect it,
he loves his home

14:55.711 --> 14:59.055
and he's gonna fight for
the best price for it.

14:59.090 --> 15:00.181
Good you have a minute?

15:00.257 --> 15:01.257
I do.

15:01.309 --> 15:06.145
But this is just like a
very awkward phone call.

15:06.222 --> 15:10.316
So basically, I made a mistake,

15:10.393 --> 15:12.660
I underpriced it at two
and a quarter.

15:13.604 --> 15:14.695
Yes.

15:14.772 --> 15:16.452
We under priced it at
two and a quarter.

15:17.751 --> 15:21.035
We've had a lot
of interest from people

15:21.112 --> 15:22.828
just like your clients.

15:22.905 --> 15:26.507
I think I can get a deal
done at around 2.5.

15:31.247 --> 15:32.513
No, not really.

15:35.126 --> 15:37.093
So I can understand.

15:37.128 --> 15:39.095
I can understand that
you're confused.

15:39.130 --> 15:40.607
The seller will no longer sell
it at two and a quarter.

15:40.631 --> 15:42.440
The seller wants
something near 2point5.

15:45.302 --> 15:47.603
Listen, this guy is
technically right.

15:47.638 --> 15:50.439
I'm getting them to negotiate
basically against themselves.

15:50.474 --> 15:51.941
And if I was in his shoes,

15:51.976 --> 15:54.068
I'd probably be doing
the same thing.

15:54.145 --> 15:56.112
But I'm not in his shoes.

15:56.147 --> 15:58.614
So if you can get your
clients to come up,

15:58.625 --> 16:00.917
I'm with my seller
right now and-

16:03.463 --> 16:05.183
You don't even want to talk
to your clients?

16:08.451 --> 16:10.093
He took that well.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.433
You know what? I can't do this.

16:18.002 --> 16:21.303
I do respect John for
taking this risk.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.639
I mean this is the only
buyer we have.

16:23.674 --> 16:28.144
But he believes in his price and
he believes in his place.

16:28.154 --> 16:31.147
I can't help think about my life

16:31.182 --> 16:33.649
and my business right now.

16:33.684 --> 16:36.902
I think I used to take more
risk than I do now.

16:36.979 --> 16:40.656
Because I used to have a lot
less responsibility.

16:40.667 --> 16:43.826
And there's something thrilling

16:43.861 --> 16:46.328
about being able to
live that way.

16:46.363 --> 16:47.363
Let's do this.

16:48.532 --> 16:52.293
Yeah, one thing I forgot
to say before.

16:52.369 --> 16:54.837
So how long you been
showing them apartments.

16:54.848 --> 16:56.005
Two days?

16:56.040 --> 16:57.040
Two months?

16:57.075 --> 16:58.143
Really? Because when we
were there he said

16:58.167 --> 17:00.843
that they've been looking for
maybe six months or so.

17:00.854 --> 17:02.595
And now you as their broker-

17:02.671 --> 17:03.804
No, no, no, hey, hey, hey.

17:03.881 --> 17:05.181
You got to speak before.

17:05.191 --> 17:06.193
No this is Ryan's time okay?

17:06.217 --> 17:07.358
This is Serhant time.

17:07.435 --> 17:09.362
If he's going to come after
me then I'm gonna go after him.

17:09.386 --> 17:11.145
You listen to me mother... er.

17:11.222 --> 17:12.699
This is what we're doing,
you're gonna go back

17:12.723 --> 17:13.867
to your clients and
you're going to tell them

17:13.891 --> 17:15.691
that they just lost
the greatest apartment

17:15.726 --> 17:17.358
in the history of the world

17:17.369 --> 17:19.194
over a couple hundred
thousand dollars

17:19.204 --> 17:21.321
that they've been looking for
for over six months

17:21.397 --> 17:22.698
and it's all your fault.

17:22.733 --> 17:23.523
And this is what you're
going to do,

17:23.601 --> 17:24.532
you're going to pick
up the phone

17:24.544 --> 17:25.376
and then you're gonna
call me back

17:25.453 --> 17:26.713
and you're gonna tell me
how you feel.

17:26.737 --> 17:27.703
And then guess what?

17:27.738 --> 17:28.938
Guess what?

17:28.973 --> 17:31.123
You and I, were never going
to do a deal again, ever.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.833
Ever, all right?

17:32.910 --> 17:34.888
That's what you're going to
remember from this phone call.

17:34.912 --> 17:35.611
If they want to come up,

17:35.646 --> 17:36.712
you know how to reach me.

17:36.747 --> 17:38.547
Otherwise, never call me again.

17:41.585 --> 17:43.478
Damn that f... ing felt good.

17:45.923 --> 17:46.806
Coming up.

17:46.882 --> 17:48.891
Please, please, tell
me you're joking

17:48.902 --> 17:50.309
because it's a very bad joke.

17:50.386 --> 17:51.386
You saw me calling him-

17:51.428 --> 17:52.945
Call him yourself.

18:07.736 --> 18:09.328
Would you like
something to drink?

18:19.290 --> 18:20.005
Bonjour!

18:20.082 --> 18:21.006
Hi!

18:21.083 --> 18:22.227
Fredrik! Hey it's good
to see you again.

18:22.251 --> 18:22.925
Fredrik.

18:22.936 --> 18:24.385
Hi! How are you?

18:24.461 --> 18:27.388
My launch was a megasuccess.

18:27.464 --> 18:30.516
I've been getting phone calls
over and over and over

18:30.593 --> 18:32.935
again from high power,
executive brokers.

18:32.970 --> 18:35.104
And they're all telling me
that they have buyers

18:35.115 --> 18:36.689
that want to buy in my building.

18:36.765 --> 18:38.616
So what can I do for you?

18:42.813 --> 18:44.446
3E!

18:44.457 --> 18:46.115
My client, she works in fashion,

18:46.150 --> 18:47.794
and it's the penthouse,
the one in the middle

18:47.818 --> 18:48.909
that she really wants.

18:48.986 --> 18:49.869
Ooh la la.

18:49.945 --> 18:51.120
Ooh la la indeed.

18:51.131 --> 18:54.290
6.5 million.

18:54.300 --> 19:00.462
He will take it, but at 6point3.

19:00.497 --> 19:01.130
No.

19:01.165 --> 19:02.298
No, no, no.

19:02.333 --> 19:05.759
3,525,000 is that a
full ask offer?

19:05.836 --> 19:08.396
No actually the
offer is 3point2.

19:09.173 --> 19:10.239
That's not going to work.

19:10.241 --> 19:12.725
Her budget for this
was actually only 8 million.

19:12.801 --> 19:14.143
And that's really the
final offer.

19:14.178 --> 19:15.822
Well she can buy everything
but the penthouse.

19:15.846 --> 19:18.147
I mean I think 6F is a
really good one.

19:18.158 --> 19:21.400
The discount itself is that I
came to you guys first.

19:21.477 --> 19:24.153
Why would I negotiate in
the very beginning?

19:24.188 --> 19:25.154
There are so many amazing

19:25.189 --> 19:26.822
developments in
Manhattan as well.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.991
Designed by Kravitz
with parking, I don't think so.

19:29.026 --> 19:31.660
I'm offering 4,000 a foot
for this place

19:31.695 --> 19:34.496
and that's a high offer, even
for Manhattan, right?

19:34.531 --> 19:36.332
We're asking 5,000 and
I will get 5,000.

19:36.367 --> 19:40.252
Ten million's a definite no.

19:40.329 --> 19:42.013
Thank you anyway.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.275
That's it? You're just
going to walk away?

19:44.333 --> 19:45.516
Bye!

19:47.544 --> 19:48.610
I'm not trying to broke you.

19:48.612 --> 19:50.190
Very soon, later today,
probably in 15 minutes,

19:50.214 --> 19:51.680
that one will be gone.

19:51.715 --> 19:53.818
So if I were you, I would call
him right now, let's do it.

19:53.842 --> 19:55.153
Maybe you can meet me half way.

19:55.177 --> 19:56.310
5% discounts.

19:56.387 --> 19:57.387
It's a no.

19:57.605 --> 19:58.771
Do you understand?

19:58.847 --> 20:00.272
It's like it's now or nothing.

20:00.349 --> 20:04.109
So let's do the deal,
295full ask.

20:04.186 --> 20:05.486
I guess you give me no choice,

20:05.562 --> 20:06.654
I should call my client.

20:17.241 --> 20:19.508
What is he saying?

20:22.055 --> 20:23.295
So he agrees.

20:23.372 --> 20:24.713
Excuse me? >> Yeah.

20:24.724 --> 20:25.381
Full ask?

20:25.416 --> 20:26.966
Yes.

20:27.042 --> 20:28.217
Yes!

20:28.228 --> 20:30.219
He's pretty reluctant
but he agrees.

20:30.254 --> 20:31.887
Reluctantly rich!
He's gonna get rich!

20:31.922 --> 20:33.314
Voila!

20:33.424 --> 20:36.892
My first deal is done in Paris.

20:36.927 --> 20:38.694
He will take it.

20:39.555 --> 20:40.813
295.

20:40.889 --> 20:41.722
Deal done, yes.

20:41.799 --> 20:42.907
Deal done, yes.

20:45.769 --> 20:47.695
Wait, I'm sorry,
no more real estate.

20:47.771 --> 20:49.196
It's everything!

20:49.273 --> 20:50.698
It's perfection!

20:50.774 --> 20:53.075
Eklund perfection!

20:53.110 --> 20:54.110
Magnifique!

21:01.118 --> 21:02.543
You listen to me mother... er!

21:02.619 --> 21:03.319
If they want to come up,

21:03.354 --> 21:04.420
you know how to reach me.

21:04.455 --> 21:06.222
Otherwise, never call me again.

21:10.794 --> 21:11.510
Hey!

21:11.587 --> 21:13.095
Hey.

21:13.130 --> 21:16.223
I called him, to say it lightly.

21:16.300 --> 21:17.766
I did what I could.

21:17.801 --> 21:19.935
We'll see, I don't know
what to tell you.

21:19.970 --> 21:22.187
Well, anything is worth a try.

21:22.264 --> 21:25.107
Yeah I used to believe that.

21:25.142 --> 21:27.443
Why do you mean you
used to believe that?

21:27.478 --> 21:29.236
You know, very busy
and selling homes

21:29.313 --> 21:34.199
every single day and it
kind of seems like

21:34.276 --> 21:35.367
everyday is the same.

21:35.444 --> 21:38.454
I don't know why I'm opening up
to you right now but.

21:38.489 --> 21:40.748
Sometimes in life,
if you really want

21:40.824 --> 21:43.792
to feel better about
the direction you're going,

21:43.827 --> 21:48.472
screw it, take a risk,
and it has a reward.

21:49.792 --> 21:52.092
What's the reward?

21:52.169 --> 21:54.979
That's-

21:56.840 --> 21:57.639
No way.

21:57.674 --> 21:59.141
So this is the broker.

22:00.177 --> 22:01.310
You want to see?

22:01.345 --> 22:02.102
Watch him yell at me.

22:02.179 --> 22:02.978
Ready?

22:03.013 --> 22:04.905
This is the answer to your risk.

22:06.016 --> 22:07.016
This is Ryan.

22:26.012 --> 22:27.252
Same conditions though?

22:27.329 --> 22:28.763
All cash?

22:31.708 --> 22:33.893
Hold on quick for one second.

22:34.711 --> 22:36.136
Whoa.

22:36.213 --> 22:38.013
That's 2point4.

22:38.048 --> 22:39.515
Do you want to do the deal?

22:39.525 --> 22:41.609
We're gonna do the deal.

22:43.720 --> 22:44.987
We have a deal.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.273
Yes!

22:48.350 --> 22:50.150
Yes!

22:50.227 --> 22:51.360
And you're a good broker.

22:51.395 --> 22:53.946
I said some things before,
but you are a good broker.

22:54.022 --> 22:55.114
It worked!

22:55.190 --> 22:56.376
He took a risk and it worked
and it paid off

22:56.400 --> 22:58.117
and he got exactly what
he wanted.

22:58.193 --> 22:58.951
How did you know?

22:59.027 --> 23:00.035
I don't understand.

23:00.070 --> 23:01.837
Risks has its rewards.

23:04.074 --> 23:05.508
John's right.

23:06.368 --> 23:09.002
This is what's been
wrong with me.

23:09.079 --> 23:11.839
My therapist advised to
take a step back.

23:11.915 --> 23:14.216
Might be great advice for
a lot of people,

23:14.251 --> 23:15.676
but not for me.

23:15.752 --> 23:18.554
My problem isn't that I'm busy,

23:18.589 --> 23:21.515
it's that I'm not taking
enough risks

23:21.592 --> 23:24.685
like I used to when I first
got into the business.

23:24.761 --> 23:26.728
And I need to go back to
what it felt like

23:26.763 --> 23:28.856
when I was up against a wall.

23:28.932 --> 23:32.359
I need to go for broke
every single day.

23:32.436 --> 23:34.069
And I have no idea what
I should do.

23:34.104 --> 23:35.696
But I know I need to
do something

23:35.772 --> 23:37.364
and it's got to be big.

23:37.441 --> 23:38.031
Thank you.

23:38.108 --> 23:39.141
Thank you.

23:39.176 --> 23:40.753
This has been a wonderful
experience for me.

23:40.777 --> 23:41.743
Me too!

23:41.778 --> 23:43.337
Maybe more so for me.

23:54.791 --> 23:57.885
Paris is so beautiful right now.

23:57.961 --> 24:00.053
I mean, that's what I heard
somebody say in the lobby

24:00.130 --> 24:01.889
at my hotel 'cause
I wouldn't know because

24:01.965 --> 24:06.018
I have been laser focused on
selling 75 Kenmare.

24:06.094 --> 24:08.187
No, no, no, no, no I don't
think you understand.

24:08.263 --> 24:11.106
I am trying to do you a favor by
selling you this apartment.

24:11.141 --> 24:14.109
1695 is asking price.

24:14.144 --> 24:17.112
And I'm not talking euros,
I'm talking US dollars.

24:17.147 --> 24:20.032
I sold three units in my first
round negotiations

24:20.108 --> 24:22.293
and since then I sold
two more units.

24:23.153 --> 24:25.412
I mean it feels really good
because five units

24:25.489 --> 24:28.373
only four units from my
goal of nine units.

24:28.450 --> 24:30.292
I'm over half way there.

24:30.327 --> 24:32.647
I can do this, I can do this,
I really think I can do this.

24:33.664 --> 24:34.963
Hi Steve.

24:34.998 --> 24:36.089
What's going on, buddy?

24:36.166 --> 24:37.132
Bonjour!

24:37.167 --> 24:38.311
How are you? Good to see you.

24:38.335 --> 24:39.459
Good to see you, buddy.

24:39.836 --> 24:43.305
I've been talking to my buyers
and they love the finishes,

24:43.340 --> 24:44.973
they love the layout.

24:44.984 --> 24:48.227
But they're a little nervous
about buying so early.

24:48.303 --> 24:50.312
So I want to try to get them
a little something.

24:50.323 --> 24:51.980
You're coming to
my birthday party right?

24:51.991 --> 24:53.232
I told you I would be there.

24:53.308 --> 24:55.442
I wouldn't miss you going over
the hill for anything.

24:55.519 --> 24:56.643
Whatever with you.

24:56.721 --> 24:59.321
Trust me, I'm just getting
started, this is Fredrik 2.0.

24:59.332 --> 25:00.155
Yeah?

25:00.190 --> 25:01.323
Yeah watch me.

25:01.358 --> 25:03.575
I'm on 3.0 Steve Gold 3.0.

25:03.652 --> 25:05.786
Well then I'm on 3.5
because I'm ahead.

25:05.862 --> 25:07.287
Actually I'm on 3.6.

25:07.364 --> 25:10.123
Okay so is that your offer?
3.6 what unit?

25:10.200 --> 25:12.334
The only unit they
want is the Flot,

25:12.345 --> 25:13.961
and they want it on the
fourth floor.

25:14.037 --> 25:14.936
You're a really good broker,

25:14.938 --> 25:15.846
that is probably,
arguably one of the

25:15.923 --> 25:19.174
best units especially for
that price, 385.

25:19.185 --> 25:20.442
Correct.

25:20.444 --> 25:25.314
So they've said to me I can
present a full ask offer.

25:26.550 --> 25:31.019
However, transfers are 70,000.

25:31.054 --> 25:32.365
You're going to have to
get the sponsor

25:32.389 --> 25:33.981
to pay the transfer taxes.

25:34.057 --> 25:35.857
And why is that?

25:35.892 --> 25:37.859
Because that's the
deal, Fredrik.

25:37.894 --> 25:39.372
No that's the deal that
your buyer wants.

25:39.396 --> 25:40.295
I mean-

25:40.297 --> 25:42.030
No that's the deal we
have to make.

25:42.065 --> 25:44.116
You know, in New York,
we have state

25:44.192 --> 25:48.287
and city transfer taxes
and they equal 1.825% together.

25:48.363 --> 25:51.707
Generally, that's something
that's paid for by the seller.

25:51.742 --> 25:54.042
In new development,
the developer,

25:54.077 --> 25:56.336
often tries to get
that transfer tax

25:56.413 --> 25:57.713
to be paid for by the buyer.

25:57.748 --> 26:00.215
Transfer taxes have
to be paid for.

26:00.226 --> 26:01.786
But they're not going
to be paid for.

26:03.211 --> 26:05.053
Let me text him.

26:05.064 --> 26:06.605
Make it happen.

26:12.929 --> 26:13.895
Thank you.

26:13.930 --> 26:14.989
Merci beuacoup.

26:16.099 --> 26:17.324
Hold on.

26:20.270 --> 26:24.573
Okay, the best and final,
the best he will do

26:24.608 --> 26:26.658
is to split the transfer taxes.

26:26.735 --> 26:28.243
35,000 dollars each.

26:28.278 --> 26:30.746
I know my buyer,
his offer is his offer.

26:30.756 --> 26:32.664
You saw me calling him,
now let's call yours.

26:32.741 --> 26:33.665
Let's do it.

26:33.742 --> 26:35.094
You think you know your
buyer, you never know,

26:35.118 --> 26:36.418
last minute, last day.

26:36.453 --> 26:37.753
Calm yourself.

26:37.763 --> 26:38.846
Let me text him.

26:44.795 --> 26:46.595
What are you gonna do
the next couple days?

26:46.630 --> 26:49.598
I actually have a lunch
with Dan tomorrow.

26:49.609 --> 26:51.725
Um-

26:51.802 --> 26:52.768
What?

26:52.803 --> 26:54.061
Dan Hollander my developer?

26:54.137 --> 26:55.604
It's about a new project.

26:55.639 --> 26:56.783
It's not about Kenmare,
of course I wouldn't

26:56.807 --> 26:57.606
talk to him about Kenmare.

26:57.617 --> 26:59.033
You're the agent for that.

27:01.311 --> 27:03.445
Please, please tell me
you're joking.

27:03.456 --> 27:05.080
'Cause it's a very bad joke.

27:05.774 --> 27:06.793
Wait, wait, wait, let me
get this straight.

27:06.817 --> 27:09.117
I invite him to Paris,
he comes to Paris

27:09.128 --> 27:10.535
as the only New York broker.

27:10.612 --> 27:14.122
He then takes a lunch with
my developer!?

27:14.133 --> 27:15.174
What?

27:17.970 --> 27:18.877
Coming up.

27:18.954 --> 27:20.629
I have this crazy idea.

27:20.640 --> 27:23.057
But it's going to effect
your life too.

27:31.651 --> 27:34.559
Steve, please, please
tell me you're joking.

27:34.636 --> 27:35.811
'Cause it's a very bad joke.

27:35.846 --> 27:38.814
You would not come to Paris,
go to my launch,

27:38.824 --> 27:40.816
to meet my developer.

27:40.851 --> 27:42.317
Is he yours? You own him?

27:42.328 --> 27:43.448
I did 50 Clinton with him.

27:43.520 --> 27:45.070
I programmed 75 Kenmare!

27:45.147 --> 27:46.833
We're talking about six
years and then you're saying

27:46.857 --> 27:48.323
"I'm having lunch."

27:48.358 --> 27:50.376
There's nothing wrong
with what I'm doing.

27:51.003 --> 27:51.860
What's the problem?

27:51.862 --> 27:53.453
This is like normal business.

27:53.530 --> 27:55.163
He does it all the time.

27:55.198 --> 27:57.624
We all go after the same
listings, we compete.

27:57.701 --> 27:59.251
Dan has another project
that Fredrik's

27:59.327 --> 28:01.920
not even selling in
Greenwich Village right now.

28:01.997 --> 28:03.317
He's worked with other
people too.

28:03.373 --> 28:05.173
He worked with Leonard on the
13th Street project-

28:05.184 --> 28:06.675
That was before I met him!

28:06.686 --> 28:08.510
Calm down, Fredrik.

28:08.545 --> 28:10.022
No I'm not going to-
This is who I am.

28:10.046 --> 28:12.013
This is my life,
I devoted my life to this.

28:12.048 --> 28:13.140
Don't you understand?

28:13.216 --> 28:14.474
I devote my life to this too.

28:14.551 --> 28:16.184
You're not the only f... ing
person in New York City.

28:16.195 --> 28:17.686
There's so many other
developers.

28:17.697 --> 28:18.823
What are you doing right now?

28:18.847 --> 28:20.522
Fredrik, don't be ridiculous.

28:20.557 --> 28:21.523
You don't own New York City.

28:21.558 --> 28:22.816
You don't own Dan.

28:22.893 --> 28:25.193
I'm having lunch,
that is normal.

28:25.228 --> 28:26.862
And it's a scumbag move
and I don't like it.

28:26.872 --> 28:28.113
It is not scumbag.

28:28.190 --> 28:29.709
Is it Broadway uptown
that I've been talking to you-

28:29.733 --> 28:30.866
is ch-is it West Chelsea?

28:30.901 --> 28:31.800
Which one is it?

28:31.802 --> 28:32.710
Tell me which address
'cause you know,

28:32.786 --> 28:34.536
I'm talking to him too and
he is my developer.

28:34.547 --> 28:37.956
Don't be this person
that is all high and mighty

28:38.033 --> 28:40.000
when you have done
the same thing.

28:40.076 --> 28:42.377
This is business,
this is New York City,

28:42.412 --> 28:43.462
this is normal.

28:43.538 --> 28:45.547
Don't f... ing get it twisted.

28:45.558 --> 28:46.548
Then you don't know me,
then you're not my friend.

28:46.559 --> 28:49.468
I do not steal developers.

28:49.544 --> 28:51.386
You didn't just sign
an exclusive

28:51.421 --> 28:53.054
with that one I was pitching?

28:53.089 --> 28:54.192
That penthouse at
Grennwich Lane,

28:54.216 --> 28:55.307
you wouldn't do that?

28:55.383 --> 28:56.694
We have the same
f... ing clients!

28:56.718 --> 28:57.726
Unknown to me.

28:57.737 --> 29:00.061
We have the same
f... ing clients.

29:00.096 --> 29:02.731
This is not happening,
you are insane.

29:02.742 --> 29:04.900
I'm not insane,
I'm actually quite sane.

29:04.935 --> 29:06.568
You're insane, Fredrik.

29:06.579 --> 29:08.069
It is not how you do it.

29:08.104 --> 29:10.405
I'm starting to lose respect
for you now, man.

29:10.440 --> 29:12.416
When did you become
such a whiner?

29:13.443 --> 29:15.660
What I care about
is my business.

29:15.737 --> 29:17.996
You don't understand.
Nobody understands.

29:18.073 --> 29:20.749
It's who I am in here
and I can't-

29:20.760 --> 29:23.001
I can't be anything else
than I am.

29:23.078 --> 29:24.503
Are you gonna cry?

29:24.579 --> 29:26.619
I don't care anymore,
I don't care about anybody.

29:28.124 --> 29:29.549
You're gonna freakin' cry?

29:29.626 --> 29:30.692
Like be confident!

29:30.694 --> 29:32.260
Be like "Go have lunch
with him, I know I got it."

29:32.271 --> 29:33.271
That's how I would be.

29:35.775 --> 29:36.865
I'm lost.

29:36.867 --> 29:39.351
I mean I don't know what
the f... is happening.

29:39.427 --> 29:41.520
You are being dramatic, Fredrik.

29:41.596 --> 29:42.270
So stop being-

29:42.305 --> 29:43.271
I'm gonna leave now.

29:43.306 --> 29:44.105
So stop being so dramatic.

29:44.140 --> 29:45.440
And just chill out.

29:45.451 --> 29:47.868
I don't need this.

29:50.438 --> 29:52.280
Actually Fredrik, Fredrik!

29:52.315 --> 29:53.448
What?

29:53.483 --> 29:55.116
We got a deal on 4F.

29:55.127 --> 29:56.127
Send the term sheet.

30:10.292 --> 30:12.267
So what's happening?

30:12.836 --> 30:15.136
So listen, I have um.

30:15.171 --> 30:17.472
I have this crazy idea.

30:17.483 --> 30:19.307
And I've been thinking
about it a lot.

30:19.342 --> 30:21.476
About what like what
makes me happy.

30:21.511 --> 30:22.060
Right?

30:22.137 --> 30:23.011
Right.

30:23.047 --> 30:24.479
It's not just selling
apartments,

30:24.514 --> 30:28.275
it's building business,
it's building the team.

30:28.351 --> 30:31.278
We've done a significant
amount of volume

30:31.354 --> 30:33.113
in Brooklyn this year.

30:33.189 --> 30:38.451
And there's a brokerage
out there called Online Homes.

30:38.528 --> 30:40.212
Yes.

30:42.007 --> 30:43.665
That I want to buy.

30:43.700 --> 30:46.501
You want to buy a brokerage.

30:46.536 --> 30:48.420
I think so.

30:48.496 --> 30:50.463
I want to own something.

30:50.540 --> 30:51.851
Since my conversation with
John, I've been thinking

30:51.875 --> 30:54.342
about something like this a lot.

30:54.377 --> 30:56.678
So I looked up a lot of
different brokerages

30:56.713 --> 31:01.516
and this one in Brooklyn
seems to be the perfect fit.

31:01.551 --> 31:04.185
But it's a lot of money,
it's a lot of risk.

31:04.220 --> 31:06.479
Like, Nestseekers isn't
paying for that.

31:06.556 --> 31:09.858
So if I want to expand
my team in Brooklyn by buying

31:09.893 --> 31:12.360
out another brokerage,
and absorbing all

31:12.395 --> 31:15.030
of their best
players into my team,

31:15.040 --> 31:18.617
that's my money and
there's no safety net there.

31:18.693 --> 31:20.619
How big is this team?

31:20.695 --> 31:22.203
They're like thirty.

31:22.238 --> 31:25.123
And you would run it
entirely on your own?

31:25.200 --> 31:27.500
I mean we'd absorb them
into the Serhant team

31:27.577 --> 31:30.545
and that would exponentially
grow us into Brooklyn

31:30.580 --> 31:33.048
without having to do it agent
by agent by agent.

31:33.058 --> 31:34.393
And this is something that
bigger companies

31:34.417 --> 31:37.052
do all the time, I just never-

31:37.087 --> 31:38.553
I just never thought
I could do it.

31:38.564 --> 31:40.388
It's going to cost a
lot of money.

31:40.399 --> 31:43.558
Like a couple million bucks.

31:43.593 --> 31:45.060
But it would be mine.

31:45.095 --> 31:47.020
And then where does
it go from there?

31:47.097 --> 31:50.231
If we buy them, then
we just keep buying,

31:50.266 --> 31:52.484
and then we get bigger and
bigger and bigger.

31:52.560 --> 31:56.071
And then we go nationwide,
and that's the goal.

31:56.081 --> 31:59.866
My business in LA is growing
so incredibly fast.

31:59.943 --> 32:02.744
My business in Miami
is blowing through the roof.

32:02.779 --> 32:05.205
What I really want, is more.

32:05.281 --> 32:06.748
I want to be able to go
across country

32:06.759 --> 32:12.346
and see for sale signs with
my name on it everywhere.

32:12.598 --> 32:13.933
I mean it's going to take
a lot of time,

32:13.957 --> 32:15.590
a lot of time and effort.

32:15.601 --> 32:18.226
You tell me, what do you think?

32:19.438 --> 32:21.096
I think it's exciting.

32:21.131 --> 32:22.430
It's going to be really tough.

32:23.466 --> 32:24.516
Especially for me.

32:24.592 --> 32:25.600
Why?

32:25.635 --> 32:28.269
I have to sacrifice
more time with you

32:28.280 --> 32:30.522
and it's going to be hard.

32:30.598 --> 32:32.440
It's gonna be tough.

32:32.475 --> 32:35.860
And it's gonna be years of work.

32:35.937 --> 32:37.612
So should I not do it.

32:37.647 --> 32:38.958
You've never been
happy just doing

32:38.982 --> 32:40.699
what everybody else does.

32:40.775 --> 32:44.586
And that's part of the
reason why I love you so much.

32:48.491 --> 32:50.300
I think you should do it.

32:51.470 --> 32:52.794
I think you should do it.

32:52.805 --> 32:54.429
Ha! She said yes!

32:54.956 --> 32:57.298
Sh... now I have to
buy this company!

32:57.309 --> 32:59.050
But you know what? It's good.

32:59.127 --> 33:00.969
It's good.
Let's f... ing do this.

33:01.004 --> 33:02.762
The most important thing is that

33:02.839 --> 33:04.973
we find time for each other.

33:05.008 --> 33:05.974
Let's make time.

33:06.009 --> 33:07.559
We're gonna do it,
we'll make the time.

33:07.635 --> 33:09.310
When was the last time
you were in Paris?

33:09.345 --> 33:12.147
In Paris? Like Paris, France?

33:12.182 --> 33:14.607
I promise Fredrik that I
would go to his birthday party.

33:14.684 --> 33:15.828
We're actually on good
terms now.

33:15.852 --> 33:16.818
Well that's good to hear.

33:16.853 --> 33:18.153
Yeah, very weird.

33:18.163 --> 33:20.447
And he decided to have
his birthday party in Paris.

33:20.523 --> 33:23.241
We've never been there,
I've never taken you to Paris.

33:23.318 --> 33:25.994
And we make time, we make
time, we grow,

33:26.005 --> 33:29.998
we build together, and we figure
it out one step at a time.

33:30.009 --> 33:32.167
I'll go to Paris with you.

33:32.202 --> 33:34.294
Maybe I'll find us brokers
there to buy.

33:34.370 --> 33:37.014
Luis is there, we can have
Luis run Serhant France.

33:50.553 --> 33:51.753
I mean, don't get me wrong.

33:51.788 --> 33:55.190
I am very, very happy I got the
deal done for my buyer.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.692
But other than that, Fredrik
kind of screwed up

33:57.727 --> 33:59.319
my whole trip to Paris.

34:00.188 --> 34:02.447
Hi. >> Hey Jess.

34:02.524 --> 34:03.790
How's it going in New York?

34:06.069 --> 34:07.535
Paris is beautiful.

34:07.570 --> 34:11.039
But I'm determined not to
let Fredrik get to me.

34:11.050 --> 34:12.885
I've been doing everything
I can to concentrate

34:12.909 --> 34:14.626
on my business back in New York.

34:14.702 --> 34:17.712
Everyone's doing their job
when the cat's away?

34:17.746 --> 34:19.505
I finally took Jess's advice

34:19.581 --> 34:21.216
and I started building my team.

34:21.226 --> 34:22.728
Hey it's Bradley Cooper from
Town how are you?

34:22.752 --> 34:26.971
Bradley Cooper is officially
part of the Gold Group.

34:27.047 --> 34:29.516
And I even called my
old friend Ian

34:29.592 --> 34:31.391
and made him the same offer.

34:31.402 --> 34:32.976
I'm blown away right now.

34:33.054 --> 34:34.062
Yeah, thank you!

34:34.097 --> 34:35.574
I think I'm gonna
grow a little bit.

34:35.598 --> 34:36.856
Not huge.

34:36.933 --> 34:38.525
You know, I see somewhere
between six

34:38.601 --> 34:40.068
and ten being the sweet spot.

34:40.103 --> 34:42.570
It's so nice to you know,
have some people

34:42.605 --> 34:46.699
to support me and you know
like have the team now.

34:46.775 --> 34:48.743
I know I told Fredrik
I'm gonna go to his birthday

34:48.777 --> 34:50.703
party but quite frankly,
I'm out of here.

34:50.780 --> 34:52.757
If he is going to accuse me
of stealing his clients,

34:52.782 --> 34:54.581
I'd much rather go
back to New York

34:54.617 --> 34:56.376
and focus on my new team.

34:56.452 --> 34:58.670
But first, I'm having
that lunch with Dan.

34:58.746 --> 34:59.921
Okay see you tomorrow,

34:59.932 --> 35:02.182
but don't let Brad
sit in my chair.

35:08.131 --> 35:09.055
I'm so happy you're here.

35:09.132 --> 35:10.431
It's been very stressful.

35:10.442 --> 35:13.393
Honestly I didn't mean to get
so emotional with Steve.

35:13.469 --> 35:16.271
I mean, I was angry at
him but the tears,

35:16.306 --> 35:17.897
they weren't really about that.

35:17.974 --> 35:20.075
I don't cry when I get angry.

35:21.144 --> 35:25.446
Derek called me and said
he has baby news.

35:25.481 --> 35:27.293
But I told him just wait,
wait, wait, whatever it is,

35:27.317 --> 35:29.617
give it to me here, in Paris.

35:29.652 --> 35:33.213
Okay well I have some news.

35:35.658 --> 35:37.542
Well I'm not sure I
want to hear it.

35:37.619 --> 35:39.259
I feel so vulnerable
because it feels like

35:39.287 --> 35:41.880
it's almost like your heart.

35:42.832 --> 35:44.465
Is out there.

35:44.500 --> 35:45.934
It's like time is gonna stop.

35:46.478 --> 35:49.053
Regardless, what he's
gonna tell me,

35:49.130 --> 35:50.981
it's just gonna stop.

35:53.509 --> 35:54.509
Coming up.

35:56.679 --> 35:57.812
Five years ago,

35:57.847 --> 36:00.106
impossible that you
will fly anywhere,

36:00.183 --> 36:02.817
you wouldn't even go to
Tribeca just for his birthday.

36:02.828 --> 36:05.537
I would go to Tribeca
to jump in his pool.

36:15.156 --> 36:16.623
I have some news.

36:19.702 --> 36:22.262
Well I'm not sure
I want to hear it.

36:28.211 --> 36:29.331
What do you think of that?

36:29.379 --> 36:32.180
What is that?

36:32.215 --> 36:35.275
What does it say?

36:39.055 --> 36:42.523
Baby A.

36:42.534 --> 36:44.451
Do you want to see Baby B?

36:47.897 --> 36:48.947
Are you sure?

36:49.023 --> 36:51.166
Yes, it's real, it's very real.

36:51.734 --> 36:53.084
We're gonna be dads.

36:55.905 --> 36:57.664
Wait so it's happening?

36:57.740 --> 36:59.624
It's happening right now.

36:59.701 --> 37:02.669
We're gonna be dads!

37:02.745 --> 37:04.462
Yes!

37:04.539 --> 37:06.381
I feel like I've been running
this marathon

37:06.416 --> 37:11.302
for forty years and I finally
reached the goal.

37:11.379 --> 37:14.681
He's kicking, you see
the feet there?

37:14.757 --> 37:17.275
We're finally going to be
daddies, finally.

37:24.058 --> 37:25.242
Thank you.

37:26.269 --> 37:28.903
Everybody said that one day
when it would happen

37:28.914 --> 37:32.657
I would realize that it
was suppose to be,

37:32.734 --> 37:33.741
but I never believed them
but now you know,

37:33.752 --> 37:36.077
being here with you,
in Paris, in the sunset.

37:36.088 --> 37:38.705
Maybe this was what was
supposed to happen.

37:38.781 --> 37:39.781
Give us a kiss.

37:40.950 --> 37:42.000
It's going to be Milla-

37:42.076 --> 37:47.430
And Freddy Jr.
Are you happy with that?

37:48.249 --> 37:51.759
For the longest time
people said to me that you know,

37:51.794 --> 37:53.261
you're successful,
and you have so much

37:53.272 --> 37:54.929
success and congratulations.

37:54.964 --> 37:59.600
And I never felt-

37:59.635 --> 38:01.113
I never felt truly successful
until this moment.

38:01.137 --> 38:04.772
Thank you for taking
the lead, wow.

38:04.783 --> 38:07.033
I always want to remember
this moment.

38:17.487 --> 38:18.795
What time is it?

38:19.489 --> 38:23.717
I don't know, I'm on some
weird New York time.

38:28.664 --> 38:30.965
This is the Brooklyn deal.

38:30.976 --> 38:34.052
What happened?

38:34.128 --> 38:35.970
I have to brainstorm,
I don't know.

38:36.005 --> 38:37.138
We've arrived.

38:37.149 --> 38:38.650
I know I need to be excited
because I'm here

38:38.674 --> 38:39.840
with Emilia and everything.

38:39.842 --> 38:42.393
But I've been on the phone
nonstop since I've landed

38:42.470 --> 38:44.437
with this brokerage
company that I'm trying

38:44.514 --> 38:48.483
to buy and the deal is not okay.

38:48.518 --> 38:51.152
Yeah so I just got your message
when I got off the plane,

38:51.163 --> 38:52.653
I've been in the air.

38:52.664 --> 38:53.988
We basically had a done deal,

38:54.023 --> 38:56.082
which was super, super exciting.

38:57.485 --> 39:00.995
And then a few of their top
brokers have decided

39:01.030 --> 39:03.498
that maybe they don't
want to come over.

39:03.533 --> 39:05.177
Tell him that I'll give
them a call tomorrow.

39:05.201 --> 39:07.335
Let them know that the move
is the best thing

39:07.370 --> 39:09.754
that he could possibly
do for his career.

39:09.831 --> 39:11.798
This is what happens
every time you go away,

39:11.874 --> 39:13.892
which is why I try not
to go away.

39:15.211 --> 39:16.844
Are you okay?

39:16.879 --> 39:18.137
Yeah, it's not dead.

39:18.214 --> 39:21.015
Nothing's ever dead,
I will figure it out.

39:21.050 --> 39:26.029
Um, I got to go see Luis and
see Luis's apartment.

39:26.389 --> 39:27.389
It's gonna be fun!

39:33.729 --> 39:35.205
27.

39:36.232 --> 39:37.323
Papi!

39:37.400 --> 39:38.199
Luis!

39:38.210 --> 39:39.492
There he is!

39:39.569 --> 39:40.368
I'm here.

39:40.403 --> 39:41.494
Okay, press the passcode,

39:41.571 --> 39:43.204
it's the year of the
French Revolution.

39:43.239 --> 39:46.132
I don't know the year of the
French Revolution, okay.

39:50.913 --> 39:52.558
There's an empty bottle
of wine on this one,

39:52.582 --> 39:54.465
maybe this one is his.

39:54.542 --> 39:56.634
Yes!

39:56.711 --> 39:57.977
Welcome.

39:58.379 --> 39:59.053
Good to see you.

39:59.088 --> 40:00.138
Good to see you, please.

40:00.214 --> 40:01.139
I knew this was you.

40:01.215 --> 40:01.889
Why?

40:01.924 --> 40:03.224
No reason.

40:03.259 --> 40:04.392
Last time I saw Luis,

40:04.427 --> 40:08.396
Fredrik and I were kind
of like angry at him.

40:08.431 --> 40:10.898
I know you, you love New York.

40:10.933 --> 40:13.133
I'm just nervous that
you don't think things through.

40:13.769 --> 40:17.572
But I'm glad to see that
he hasn't really held a grudge.

40:17.607 --> 40:19.499
We acted that way because
we actually cared.

40:20.234 --> 40:21.234
Wow!

40:21.277 --> 40:22.379
Yeah, come. Let me show you.

40:22.403 --> 40:23.202
This is your apartment?!

40:23.279 --> 40:24.662
Yeah, look at this view.

40:24.739 --> 40:26.256
This is crazy!

40:31.954 --> 40:34.255
You know, for picking up
and quitting your entire life

40:34.266 --> 40:37.758
and moving to Paris,
at least he does it in style.

40:37.793 --> 40:39.260
I mean, this place is insane.

40:39.295 --> 40:40.344
It's amazing, no?

40:40.421 --> 40:41.888
Your view looks fake by the way,

40:41.964 --> 40:43.764
like this looks fake.

40:43.775 --> 40:46.434
It's like a mixture of
new and old.

40:46.469 --> 40:48.352
New kitchen,
so everything's very,

40:48.429 --> 40:49.589
very modern, the way Luis is.

40:50.473 --> 40:52.607
But it's also very like old
and antiquey,

40:52.617 --> 40:54.242
the way his brain is.

40:55.144 --> 40:57.579
He's an old soul like
his floors.

41:02.318 --> 41:04.869
It's the penthouse so
it's 10point5 million.

41:04.946 --> 41:08.539
10pont5 is actually-My
God, what's happening?

41:08.616 --> 41:10.541
10.5 million is not a lot!

41:10.618 --> 41:11.959
I have so many other
buyers here.

41:11.994 --> 41:13.138
You have no idea,
there's like hundreds

41:13.162 --> 41:14.362
and hundreds of buyers.

41:14.364 --> 41:15.807
Everybody, they're all over me,
they're surrounding me,

41:15.831 --> 41:17.089
they want me.

41:17.166 --> 41:18.799
I mean they want the
penthouse I mean.

41:18.834 --> 41:21.260
Derek had the most amazing
news for us

41:21.337 --> 41:23.221
and the sales are going great.

41:23.297 --> 41:26.140
I mean, there's more deals, more
deal sheets, more contracts.

41:26.151 --> 41:29.143
And I have this one interested
lead in one of the penthouses.

41:29.178 --> 41:30.656
And I have been calling,
calling, calling,

41:30.680 --> 41:32.313
calling, over, over, over.

41:32.348 --> 41:33.548
How do you say that in French?

41:34.183 --> 41:35.149
No. Okay whatever.

41:35.184 --> 41:36.308
That's what I've been doing.

41:36.386 --> 41:38.653
Well you're not listening to
me, that's the problem.

41:38.688 --> 41:41.739
However, this penthouse
buyer is thinking it over

41:41.816 --> 41:44.909
and told me specifically to
stop calling for a few hours.

41:44.986 --> 41:48.296
I'm gonna go meet
some important people to me.

41:54.870 --> 41:56.504
Welcome. You look amazing!

41:56.539 --> 41:58.172
We got Ryan here also!

41:58.183 --> 41:59.674
Yes! You came for my birthday!

41:59.709 --> 42:00.934
Happy Birthday!

42:02.044 --> 42:03.355
So come, can I offer
you something?

42:03.379 --> 42:06.347
A beer? Water? A beer,
we're in Paris.

42:06.382 --> 42:08.182
The guys are having
beer in Paris.

42:08.217 --> 42:08.507
I love it.

42:08.585 --> 42:09.585
Yup.

42:10.219 --> 42:12.520
Luis's apartment is like
a little dream.

42:12.555 --> 42:15.356
Like a little Parisian
penthouse dream.

42:15.391 --> 42:16.702
It's like I can hear the
French music

42:16.726 --> 42:18.276
coming in through the windows.

42:18.352 --> 42:19.360
I love it.

42:19.395 --> 42:20.778
Cheers.

42:20.855 --> 42:21.696
I can't believe it.

42:21.731 --> 42:22.833
I can't believe we're here.

42:22.857 --> 42:26.367
Okay this right now,
okay five years ago,

42:26.402 --> 42:28.369
impossible that you would
fly anywhere!

42:28.404 --> 42:31.205
You wouldn't even go to
Tribeca just for his birthday.

42:31.216 --> 42:34.008
I would go to Tribeca to
jump in his pool.

42:34.702 --> 42:36.335
So wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

42:36.412 --> 42:38.629
You seem like you're in a
good mood though.

42:38.706 --> 42:41.048
So like did you find what
you're looking for?

42:41.083 --> 42:42.083
It's a nice place.

42:42.135 --> 42:46.178
Listen, you know, the last time
we saw each other

42:46.255 --> 42:48.222
it ended up a little awkward.

42:48.257 --> 42:49.223
Because we care though.

42:49.234 --> 42:50.850
I know, I know, I can see that.

42:50.926 --> 42:53.352
Trust me, I thought about
it many times.

42:53.429 --> 42:54.395
Now you're here! You did it!

42:54.406 --> 42:55.896
And I did it,
I did it all the way.

42:55.907 --> 42:58.649
That takes balls,
to pick up everything

42:58.726 --> 43:01.819
you had in New York
and just come to Paris.

43:01.896 --> 43:05.331
Yeah but um...

43:11.572 --> 43:12.630
Um...

43:24.126 --> 43:25.092
Coming up.

43:25.127 --> 43:26.427
Bon anniversaire!

43:26.462 --> 43:30.189
Now I get to celebrate
another milestone in my life.

43:31.634 --> 43:33.234
Paris we love you!

43:47.149 --> 43:48.783
I don't want to bring this up.

43:48.793 --> 43:51.786
F... I'm sorry, dude.

43:51.796 --> 43:53.465
I keep putting this f... ing
pressure on myself

43:53.489 --> 43:55.790
to try to find out what it
is I want to do.

43:55.825 --> 43:57.291
And I come to Paris,
I leave everything behind,

43:57.302 --> 43:58.762
people think I'm crazy,
you guys thought it

43:58.786 --> 44:00.211
was not a smart idea.

44:00.287 --> 44:03.297
Then I come here
and I f... ing hate it.

44:03.332 --> 44:04.476
I'm crying all the time
and it's stupid

44:04.500 --> 44:05.811
because I'm supposed to
be the happiest man

44:05.835 --> 44:07.145
in the world, that's
really who I am.

44:07.169 --> 44:08.978
That's actually what I'm after.

44:09.314 --> 44:10.396
But I'm not happy.

44:12.174 --> 44:14.141
Even though I advised
him not to move here.

44:14.176 --> 44:17.603
It really hurts my heart to see
him so sad, it does.

44:17.680 --> 44:20.606
I was really hoping that
he would say he's had

44:20.683 --> 44:22.494
the time of his life and
that he's finding himself.

44:22.518 --> 44:24.402
This is the truth,
I've been here

44:24.478 --> 44:26.498
with this beautiful apartment
and these beautiful views,

44:26.522 --> 44:28.166
and this beautiful city,
and beautiful women,

44:28.190 --> 44:30.875
and beautiful wine.

44:32.862 --> 44:35.162
This is the thing.

44:35.197 --> 44:37.456
I sit down here and I say what
the f... am I doing?

44:37.533 --> 44:39.959
Like where am I going?

44:40.035 --> 44:45.631
You know, if there is no goal
or objective in your life

44:45.708 --> 44:50.469
there is no purpose
for you to do anything.

44:50.546 --> 44:51.512
I just don't think this is it

44:51.547 --> 44:53.139
and I think now you
actually know that.

44:53.215 --> 44:54.359
But it was something that
you needed to do

44:54.383 --> 44:56.194
and had you not done it,
you would've regretted

44:56.218 --> 44:58.945
it for the rest of your life.

45:00.222 --> 45:03.023
For me to take a big
risk with my life,

45:03.034 --> 45:05.484
I mean I had to discuss
it with Emilia,

45:05.561 --> 45:07.153
I had to discuss it with
my therapist.

45:07.229 --> 45:10.030
And I had to be told to
take a risk.

45:10.041 --> 45:13.784
Luis, he just does it.

45:13.861 --> 45:16.954
As Luis would say,
"It takes cajones."

45:17.031 --> 45:18.706
That's Spanish for balls.

45:18.741 --> 45:20.218
There is a beautiful
thing about me

45:20.242 --> 45:22.501
moving to Paris because
I've learned something.

45:22.578 --> 45:24.879
You can't be happy if you're
running around in circles

45:24.914 --> 45:26.338
and not going after something.

45:26.415 --> 45:27.415
Yes.

45:27.450 --> 45:28.207
The problem and the reason
I've been so sad

45:28.284 --> 45:31.051
is because I cannot find
that goal.

45:31.086 --> 45:34.021
Um, come back and
sell real estate.

45:34.381 --> 45:35.734
That's option one, you can
always come back

45:35.758 --> 45:37.183
and sell real estate.

45:37.259 --> 45:38.225
Right?

45:38.260 --> 45:39.260
Yes.

45:39.929 --> 45:42.563
F..., come back to us.

45:42.598 --> 45:45.733
For now I know this,

45:45.744 --> 45:50.905
Paris is not the place
I should be in.

45:50.915 --> 45:51.739
Check, done.

45:51.774 --> 45:52.406
Check, done.

45:52.441 --> 45:53.441
Bye Paris, yeah..

45:53.493 --> 45:55.420
And now come back,
figure out what I want to do,

45:55.444 --> 45:57.077
get angry, but in a good way.

45:57.088 --> 45:57.828
Angry.

45:57.905 --> 45:58.746
Fight for it.

45:58.781 --> 45:59.997
Angry like yes!

46:00.074 --> 46:01.074
Yes!

46:01.259 --> 46:02.750
Let's do it!

46:02.785 --> 46:04.510
I love you... both, I do.

46:05.430 --> 46:06.587
Hug it out.

46:06.622 --> 46:07.421
Stop!

46:07.456 --> 46:08.255
Hug it out. >> Thank you.

46:08.266 --> 46:09.256
This is my life now.

46:09.267 --> 46:10.925
Fredrik.

46:10.960 --> 46:14.178
Have you seen "Golden Girls"?

46:14.255 --> 46:16.597
This is that.

46:16.608 --> 46:18.599
Holy sh... hold on, hold on.

46:18.634 --> 46:20.318
We're taking you back!

46:32.273 --> 46:34.281
My God.

46:34.316 --> 46:35.449
Wow.

46:35.484 --> 46:38.118
That's what I call a fortieth
birthday table.

46:38.153 --> 46:39.153
My God.

46:39.205 --> 46:41.288
I've been calling nonstop,
nonstop, nonstop,

46:41.323 --> 46:43.123
to get this penthouse deal done.

46:43.158 --> 46:49.597
It's happening,
10 million dollars all cash.

46:50.642 --> 46:52.550
We did it, I did it!

46:52.626 --> 46:57.388
I sold it, the penthouse!
I sold it!

46:57.464 --> 47:00.808
I could not be happier,
honestly, nine sales.

47:00.843 --> 47:02.768
Done, I reached my goal.

47:02.845 --> 47:05.604
And now my fortieth birthday
with Big D

47:05.681 --> 47:08.866
and my friends in
freakin' Paris!

47:09.828 --> 47:11.235
This is so perfect.

47:11.312 --> 47:12.486
Hello?

47:12.521 --> 47:13.487
Hi!

47:13.498 --> 47:15.406
Bon anniversaire!

47:15.482 --> 47:16.156
Look at you!

47:16.191 --> 47:17.241
Hello.

47:17.318 --> 47:19.994
Sigge! Malin!

47:20.004 --> 47:22.329
Congratulations.

47:22.364 --> 47:23.163
How are you?

47:23.198 --> 47:24.215
Pastor Cheryl!

47:27.202 --> 47:29.162
You didn't come to Paris
for me, you were here.

47:29.204 --> 47:31.088
We were here.

47:31.165 --> 47:32.598
Hi handsome, how are you?

47:33.042 --> 47:36.135
All right, all right, all right!

47:36.211 --> 47:37.211
Luis!

47:37.780 --> 47:38.857
I couldn't decide which
date to bring

47:38.881 --> 47:40.841
so I thought to bring one
that we could all share.

47:41.693 --> 47:42.933
Happy birthday, man.

47:43.010 --> 47:44.852
I love you.

47:44.887 --> 47:45.436
Should we eat?

47:45.512 --> 47:46.186
Yes!

47:46.221 --> 47:46.812
Who's hungry?

47:46.889 --> 47:47.889
Let's do it.

47:48.390 --> 47:50.357
Cheers. >> Cheers.

47:50.368 --> 47:52.702
I'm shaking I'm so emotional.

47:53.062 --> 47:53.986
Do you think we could
get invited

47:54.063 --> 47:55.529
to your forty first birthday?

47:55.540 --> 47:56.541
Yeah I think we're
gonna have a lot

47:56.565 --> 47:58.365
of birthdays together,
I have a feeling.

47:58.400 --> 47:59.458
I hope so.

48:01.070 --> 48:02.786
Steve!

48:02.863 --> 48:04.046
What's going on guys?

48:04.573 --> 48:05.998
Hello, nice to meet you.

48:06.075 --> 48:08.134
How are you?
Im Siggy, nice to meet you.

48:08.911 --> 48:09.701
You came.

48:09.779 --> 48:10.669
Look at you, I love your shoes.

48:10.746 --> 48:11.462
Thanks.

48:11.538 --> 48:12.597
Happy birthday, man.

48:12.915 --> 48:15.049
I wasn't expecting
Steve to show up.

48:15.084 --> 48:18.052
So I wanted to tell
you in person,

48:18.087 --> 48:19.564
sometimes you forget
in all of this there's

48:19.588 --> 48:22.222
a lot more to life
than real estate.

48:22.233 --> 48:25.351
And what wouldn't be right
is if I wasn't here

48:25.427 --> 48:27.653
for you on your fortieth
birthday.

48:27.930 --> 48:29.229
Thank you.

48:29.240 --> 48:30.564
What I wanted to say.

48:30.599 --> 48:32.900
I felt really sh... y,
really bad.

48:32.935 --> 48:34.902
I was so emotional,
I was so upset.

48:34.913 --> 48:37.029
So I also want to tell you
with a lunch that I think

48:37.106 --> 48:39.206
it's fine, you should
do the lunch.

48:40.943 --> 48:42.754
I'm glad you said that,
but it didn't feel right,

48:42.778 --> 48:43.911
I cancelled the lunch.

48:43.922 --> 48:44.828
You cancelled?

48:44.905 --> 48:45.746
I cancelled the lunch.

48:45.781 --> 48:46.413
I didn't want to do it.

48:46.448 --> 48:47.748
I said you know what?

48:47.783 --> 48:49.675
It's more important, friendship.

48:50.953 --> 48:52.419
What did Dan say?

48:52.430 --> 48:53.921
Don't matter, Dan is
your developer,

48:53.932 --> 48:56.048
there's lots of
fish in New York.

48:56.125 --> 48:57.257
I don't need Dan.

48:57.268 --> 48:59.852
There's other ones out
there, Dan's yours.

49:00.104 --> 49:02.096
I mean no matter what happened,

49:02.131 --> 49:04.264
I've known Fredrik way
too long to have

49:04.299 --> 49:09.728
one little disagreement
you know, ruin a friendship.

49:09.805 --> 49:12.189
Good Fredman.
Hope you forgive me.

49:12.266 --> 49:13.732
Thank you.

49:13.809 --> 49:15.776
I'm really happy,
that's like a bonus.

49:15.787 --> 49:18.112
That's like an extra gift
to my fortieth,

49:18.147 --> 49:20.948
that he shows up and that
we are able to move forward

49:20.983 --> 49:22.708
and put that stupid
stuff behind us.

49:23.318 --> 49:24.462
How are you? Hi how are you?

49:24.486 --> 49:25.285
Good to see you.

49:25.296 --> 49:27.037
Sit, have a seat!

49:27.114 --> 49:28.122
Bon soirée.

49:28.157 --> 49:28.956
What's up!

49:28.991 --> 49:30.249
Ryan's here too?

49:30.325 --> 49:33.293
What the hell this is like
a New York reunion.

49:33.328 --> 49:35.087
New York takes Paris, sh...

49:35.164 --> 49:36.296
How was your trip, good?

49:36.331 --> 49:37.331
Good Ry.

49:37.383 --> 49:40.801
Steve Gold's like the
white Antonio Banderas,

49:40.836 --> 49:41.760
You know?

49:41.837 --> 49:43.148
I mean look at the three of you,

49:43.172 --> 49:44.805
it should be illegal to
be this beautiful

49:44.816 --> 49:45.973
to be this handsome.

49:46.008 --> 49:47.152
We're gonna put everyone's hotel

49:47.176 --> 49:51.821
keys into a bucket and see
who goes home with who.

49:53.640 --> 49:56.567
My God, Ryan you
were doing so well!

49:56.643 --> 49:57.996
What? That's not
what we're doing?

49:58.020 --> 49:59.380
I'm sorry, pastor. That's right.

50:00.832 --> 50:02.712
You don't have to put your
key in the bucket.

50:03.859 --> 50:05.909
Looking at these
people around the table,

50:05.986 --> 50:06.994
we've had so many disagreements

50:07.005 --> 50:07.828
on so many different levels,

50:07.839 --> 50:09.496
and then we're all together.

50:09.531 --> 50:11.498
We've come a long way.

50:11.533 --> 50:13.000
I feel really good.

50:13.011 --> 50:14.334
I feel really, really good.

50:14.369 --> 50:19.006
I feel like everything
that you know,

50:19.017 --> 50:23.310
all the stuff with us,
it's all coming together.

50:24.046 --> 50:27.598
Derek and I have the biggest
news of our entire lives.

50:27.674 --> 50:29.516
And right now might be
the perfect time

50:29.527 --> 50:31.310
to share it actually.

50:31.386 --> 50:33.487
I feel um...

50:49.029 --> 50:49.787
I feel really good.

50:49.863 --> 50:50.996
I feel really, really good.

50:51.073 --> 50:54.800
I feel optimistic,
we feel really good.

50:57.704 --> 51:00.380
You know, it's been a
really important week for us,

51:00.391 --> 51:01.974
let's just put it that way.

51:03.061 --> 51:05.344
Derek and I have the most
amazing news.

51:05.420 --> 51:10.057
But maybe it's actually better
to keep it between us,

51:10.092 --> 51:11.569
to keep it private for a
little longer

51:11.593 --> 51:16.355
because I've learned this year
not to force things.

51:16.431 --> 51:17.731
So you know what?

51:17.766 --> 51:19.035
Everybody's going
to find out anyway

51:19.059 --> 51:21.068
when the time is right.

51:21.103 --> 51:25.539
Okay everybody,
let's go dancing.

51:29.236 --> 51:30.669
My God!

51:31.113 --> 51:31.995
Wow.

51:32.072 --> 51:33.923
This is amazing!

51:34.449 --> 51:36.333
Okay!

51:49.256 --> 51:51.765
I mean this year was
just mind blowing to me.

51:51.800 --> 51:53.000
Yes!

51:53.035 --> 51:55.269
My biggest project to date,
Madison Square Park Tower.

51:55.304 --> 51:57.938
Steiner East Village
and 75 Kenmare,

51:57.973 --> 51:59.039
my God.

51:59.041 --> 52:01.608
Lenny Kravitz, Paris,
I mean it's been so much!

52:05.123 --> 52:07.614
You know if somebody
told me like seven years ago,

52:07.649 --> 52:10.784
when I met Derek that
you're gonna sit with him,

52:10.819 --> 52:13.203
the love of your life and you're
gonna have twins in Paris.

52:13.280 --> 52:15.214
I would never
have believed any of it.

52:16.450 --> 52:19.051
Then again, I never thought
I was going to turn forty so.

52:33.175 --> 52:35.934
This year has been a
complete roller coaster for me.

52:36.011 --> 52:38.145
I mean my business has
been incredible.

52:38.180 --> 52:39.062
Brooklyn!

52:39.139 --> 52:40.814
We have over
100 developments here.

52:40.849 --> 52:41.815
Let's do it man.

52:41.850 --> 52:42.941
Nice job.

52:43.018 --> 52:43.483
Deal?

52:43.494 --> 52:44.494
Deal.

52:44.519 --> 52:46.328
Let's hug it out.

52:46.813 --> 52:47.654
Yes!

52:47.689 --> 52:49.281
But I also questioned myself.

52:49.358 --> 52:51.992
I looked at what really really
made me happy.

52:52.027 --> 52:54.661
There's a brokerage I
want to buy.

52:54.696 --> 52:56.163
I want to own something.

52:56.174 --> 52:59.124
Take more risks everyday,
the way that I used to.

52:59.201 --> 53:00.201
So that's what I'm doing.

53:06.667 --> 53:07.808
I love you so much.

53:08.168 --> 53:09.476
Life is good!

53:11.522 --> 53:17.809
Emilia isn't just my wife,
she's my partner in life

53:17.886 --> 53:21.813
and it's awesome and
I'm excited for the future.

53:21.890 --> 53:23.782
Hey Freddy!

53:25.560 --> 53:27.611
You little-

53:27.688 --> 53:28.954
Come here.

53:29.731 --> 53:32.658
This year has been incredible!

53:32.734 --> 53:33.617
You got youself a deal.

53:33.694 --> 53:36.870
Between signed
contracts and closings,

53:36.905 --> 53:39.924
I've done over
200 million in sales.

53:42.244 --> 53:44.211
I feel like so blessed right
now in my life,

53:44.246 --> 53:47.381
I feel so positive, I feel so
optimistic for the future.

53:47.416 --> 53:48.849
I'm only 32 years old.

53:49.751 --> 53:51.894
You know, this is just
the beginning.

53:55.066 --> 53:59.226
The only thing missing right now

53:59.261 --> 54:01.320
is someone to share it all with.

54:01.722 --> 54:02.562
Wait what's happening?

54:02.597 --> 54:03.405
Did I do this?

54:03.482 --> 54:04.055
I didn't do this,
I"m not responsible.

54:04.133 --> 54:05.691
It tastes so good.

54:05.767 --> 54:07.359
Paris we love you!
