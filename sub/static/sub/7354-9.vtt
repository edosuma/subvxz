00:01.768 --> 00:03.669
<i>Previously on</i> legends...

00:03.671 --> 00:05.571
Dobson: You don't remember
anything about basra?

00:08.608 --> 00:10.542
Wonder how you survived...

00:11.344 --> 00:12.811
Sonya?

00:12.813 --> 00:14.480
At our wedding,

00:14.482 --> 00:16.315
We exchanged vows.
Do you remember?

00:16.317 --> 00:17.783
Where's this coming from?

00:17.785 --> 00:19.385
I want to be with you.

00:21.321 --> 00:23.655
Sonya: <i>What's gonna happen when</i>
<i>he finds out I've been lying</i>

00:23.657 --> 00:25.024
To him for
the past ten years?

00:25.026 --> 00:27.526
For his safety, he can't
ever know the truth.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.695
Milloy: <i>Prince abboud</i>
<i>of the house of saud</i>

00:29.697 --> 00:31.030
<i>Will be in los angeles</i>

00:31.032 --> 00:32.398
<i>For a highly-classified</i>
<i>energy meeting</i>

00:32.400 --> 00:34.233
<i>At the arcadia policy council.</i>

00:34.801 --> 00:36.368
Get down!

00:38.171 --> 00:39.905
I've got hard proof

00:39.907 --> 00:42.975
<i>Prince fayeen conspired with</i>
<i>the arcadia policy council</i>

00:42.977 --> 00:44.877
<i>To assassinate prince abboud.</i>

00:44.879 --> 00:46.979
Gates:
<i>So, what's the plan?</i>

00:46.981 --> 00:48.814
Martin:
Make the prince try to kill me.

00:48.816 --> 00:50.682
With this, I'm sure I'll be
easy to keep track of.

00:50.684 --> 00:54.153
<i>They'll want to find out who</i>
<i>I gave the intelligence to.</i>

00:57.590 --> 00:58.824
Hold on.

01:02.262 --> 01:03.328
Maggie:
The signal's gone.

01:03.330 --> 01:04.530
Maggie, where is he?

01:04.532 --> 01:05.697
It's being blocked.

01:05.699 --> 01:06.765
Lock the area down.

01:06.767 --> 01:08.734
<i>We just got an agent abducted.</i>

01:10.103 --> 01:11.737
Bashir:
We know your name.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.005
(doorbell rings)

01:13.007 --> 01:16.241
Special agent martin odum
of the fbi.

01:17.744 --> 01:19.611
You will see, there are worse
things than physical pain.

01:19.613 --> 01:21.246
This way, this way.
Hurry!

01:35.695 --> 01:38.063
We removed your microchip.

01:38.065 --> 01:39.765
Your associates won't
be able to find you.

01:39.767 --> 01:42.901
You're on your own, special
agent martin odum of the fbi.

01:42.903 --> 01:44.636
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:51.711 --> 01:54.313
Bashir:
We know who you are.

01:54.315 --> 01:55.714
We know all about
the fbi's investigations

01:55.716 --> 01:58.217
Into the arcadia council
and prince fayeen.

01:58.219 --> 01:59.551
Your investigation is over.

02:00.553 --> 02:02.287
I'm sebastian egan,

02:02.289 --> 02:04.556
And the truth is coming out,

02:04.558 --> 02:06.325
No matter what you do to me.

02:06.327 --> 02:07.926
Hani jibril
killed abboud.

02:07.928 --> 02:09.728
You will end your investigation
into prince fayeen.

02:11.664 --> 02:13.665
You've got the wrong guy.

02:20.607 --> 02:22.074
Bashir: I must admit,
I was, uh...

02:22.076 --> 02:25.310
Quite impressed
by your undercover persona.

02:25.312 --> 02:28.914
I know you have
many identities, agent odum.

02:28.916 --> 02:31.483
Tell me, when you're
in it that deep,

02:31.485 --> 02:33.285
Is it hard to keep track
of the real martin?

02:33.287 --> 02:35.587
My name is sebastian egan.

02:35.589 --> 02:37.823
Do you even know
who martin odum is anymore?

02:37.825 --> 02:39.625
(chuckles)

02:39.627 --> 02:42.628
Look, the story's getting out.

02:42.630 --> 02:44.029
You can't do anything.

02:44.031 --> 02:47.666
I admire that death is not
your first concern.

02:49.135 --> 02:51.336
But it makes me wonder what is.

02:52.605 --> 02:54.206
Your country?

02:54.208 --> 02:56.308
Your god?

02:56.310 --> 02:59.678
No, I don't think so.

03:01.548 --> 03:04.183
It is... Your family.

03:04.951 --> 03:06.185
(chuckles)

03:12.559 --> 03:14.193
There's something
you should know.

03:15.828 --> 03:17.796
Yeah...?

03:17.798 --> 03:19.464
Yeah, what's that?

03:22.535 --> 03:25.404
I'm gonna kill you.

03:46.392 --> 03:49.494
Crystal: <i>We think we know</i>
<i>how they abducted martin.</i>

03:49.496 --> 03:51.496
Traffic cameras show
an 18-wheeler

03:51.498 --> 03:53.899
Heading out of the area right
before we got there.

03:53.901 --> 03:55.701
They drove the limo
into the trailer?

03:55.703 --> 03:57.603
Which was probably lined with
something to hide his signal.

03:57.605 --> 03:58.937
What does that tell you?

03:58.939 --> 04:00.872
They knew martin was fbi.

04:00.874 --> 04:02.274
How'd they know that?

04:05.712 --> 04:08.113
Sir, the truck tags
came back no good.

04:08.115 --> 04:09.848
Serial numbers were altered.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.550
These guys covered
every single detail.

04:11.552 --> 04:13.085
What about a visual search?

04:13.087 --> 04:14.720
There's an orange stripe
on the side of the cab,

04:14.722 --> 04:17.022
But it turns out
it's a common design.

04:17.024 --> 04:18.690
A bolo's gone out
statewide already.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.592
Gates: I've
got a briefing

04:20.594 --> 04:22.628
With the attorney general
in five. Keep me apprised.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.863
Sir... Martin's
been missing

04:24.865 --> 04:26.632
For nine hours.
He could be anywhere.

04:26.634 --> 04:29.635
And wherever he is, he's
depending on us to find him.

04:29.637 --> 04:30.736
Okay?

04:30.738 --> 04:33.238
Yes, sir.

04:33.240 --> 04:35.440
(phone rings)

04:39.579 --> 04:41.213
Crystal.
Drop whatever you're doing.

04:41.215 --> 04:43.482
I need you to get over
to sonya odum's house right now.

04:43.484 --> 04:46.485
What's wrong?
She sent a 911.

04:53.559 --> 04:54.826
What do you want with us?

04:54.828 --> 04:56.295
I want you to shut up.

04:56.297 --> 04:58.263
Don't talk
to my mom like that.

04:58.265 --> 05:00.532
Aiden.

05:02.902 --> 05:06.004
How... How do you
say this, uh...

05:08.841 --> 05:10.809
"chip off the block"?

05:11.978 --> 05:14.179
You know my husband?

05:15.148 --> 05:17.416
Where's my dad?

05:21.754 --> 05:23.989
Your dad is talking
to a friend of mine.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.324
Why don't we
give him a call?

05:25.326 --> 05:28.327
I know he would love
to hear from you.

05:28.329 --> 05:29.961
(auto-dial beeping)

05:29.963 --> 05:31.663
(phone rings)

05:37.637 --> 05:38.603
Sonya?

05:38.605 --> 05:40.772
We're okay.
Dad.

05:42.508 --> 05:43.942
It's all right, kid.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.177
Don't be scared.

05:45.179 --> 05:48.513
Now do you understand
what I can do?

05:48.515 --> 05:49.781
Dad! Don't...

05:49.783 --> 05:51.550
(over phone): Aiden!
...Give up!

05:52.218 --> 05:53.218
Sonya!

05:53.220 --> 05:54.920
(grunting)

06:00.626 --> 06:01.660
You bastard.

06:01.662 --> 06:03.295
I'll kill you.

06:03.297 --> 06:05.163
Yeah, you know what,
that depends.

06:05.165 --> 06:07.866
If prince fayeen suffers
any negative consequences,

06:07.868 --> 06:10.235
Your family will be killed.
Do you understand me?

06:13.973 --> 06:15.640
Mom, are you okay?

06:20.713 --> 06:22.881
(panting):
Yeah.

06:22.883 --> 06:25.851
Okay, you win.

06:25.853 --> 06:28.687
You win.

06:28.689 --> 06:31.156
Just let them go.

06:31.158 --> 06:33.725
Please.

06:37.663 --> 06:39.030
Okay...

06:39.032 --> 06:40.766
Untie him and clean him up.

06:40.768 --> 06:42.567
Let's see what
he has to say.

06:45.171 --> 06:47.906
(grunting)

06:57.383 --> 06:59.017
(crack)

06:59.019 --> 07:01.253
(gunshots)

07:13.733 --> 07:15.901
Tactical backup is en route.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.602
Satellite's coming online,
stand by.

07:17.604 --> 07:19.704
We're one minute out.
Stay alert.

07:19.706 --> 07:21.640
They probably
got the perimeter covered.

07:44.630 --> 07:47.065
â™ª

08:06.352 --> 08:08.553
We're too late.

08:10.523 --> 08:12.123
Crystal: Definite signs
of a struggle, sir.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.426
They were
taken.
Any sense of how long?

08:14.428 --> 08:16.328
Coffee's still warm.
We just missed 'em.

08:16.330 --> 08:18.797
Get saunders from
crisis management
over there right away.

08:18.799 --> 08:22.033
Yes, sir. I'm also sending the
forensic unit to the scene now.
We're gonna knock on

08:22.035 --> 08:24.035
Some doors, see if anybody
saw anything.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.439
Sir, I have an incoming call
on our secure line.

08:27.441 --> 08:30.308
Hello? Oh, my god.
Sir, I have martin.

08:30.310 --> 08:31.176
You're on speaker.

08:31.178 --> 08:32.944
Martin, where are you?

08:32.946 --> 08:34.012
Nelson, listen to me.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.146
Sonya and aiden are in trouble.

08:35.148 --> 08:36.715
Get someone over there.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.517
Gates:
Rice and crystal are
already on the scene.

08:38.519 --> 08:41.286
Martin, your wife
and son are missing.

08:55.001 --> 08:57.235
â™ª

09:05.745 --> 09:07.212
Mom, what's
going on?

09:09.982 --> 09:11.449
No...

09:15.888 --> 09:18.089
Holy shit.

09:19.158 --> 09:20.225
Hey, maggie.

09:22.495 --> 09:24.663
If bashir doesn't call by
tonight, we'll move again.

09:24.665 --> 09:26.398
He won't call.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.900
My guess is martin
made sure of that.

09:30.269 --> 09:32.504
He doesn't call,
then you die.

09:32.506 --> 09:34.706
Sonya:
Until then,

09:34.708 --> 09:36.741
My son is hungry,
he needs to eat.

09:37.743 --> 09:39.210
You don't fight
like a housewife.

09:39.212 --> 09:41.580
I think you broke
my man's ribs.

09:43.416 --> 09:46.518
It appears martin odum isn't
the only one with secrets, huh?

09:46.520 --> 09:48.453
Mom, what's
he talking about?

09:49.889 --> 09:51.690
Hmm?

09:52.858 --> 09:55.093
I don't know, aiden.

10:00.533 --> 10:02.701
Okay, I talked to cia
and state.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.536
This is everything that
I could get on bashir.

10:04.538 --> 10:05.737
He asked for a lawyer.

10:05.739 --> 10:08.039
Right after gates
designated him

10:08.041 --> 10:09.474
An enemy combatant.

10:09.476 --> 10:10.442
If that doesn't scare
the truth out of him...

10:10.444 --> 10:11.977
Yeah, well, it better.

10:11.979 --> 10:13.044
It's only a matter of time
before those kidnappers

10:13.046 --> 10:14.412
Realize that
we have him.

10:14.414 --> 10:16.047
You think they'll kill
sonya and aiden?

10:17.583 --> 10:18.917
I need to get in there.

10:18.919 --> 10:19.951
Where's gates?

10:19.953 --> 10:21.152
He's talking to martin.

10:24.790 --> 10:25.991
(sniffs)

10:30.496 --> 10:31.796
Sure you don't
need a hospital?

10:31.798 --> 10:33.164
No.

10:33.166 --> 10:35.834
Crystal's going to do
the interrogation.

10:35.836 --> 10:38.470
I get first crack at him,
nelson. No one else.

10:38.472 --> 10:40.105
That's a bad idea.

10:40.107 --> 10:41.673
It's my family.

10:41.675 --> 10:43.808
My prisoner, my interrogation.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.110
Crystal will be in there, too.

10:45.112 --> 10:47.479
Yeah?

10:47.481 --> 10:49.681
As long as she doesn't
get in my way.

11:03.329 --> 11:04.863
Where's my family?

11:04.865 --> 11:06.464
I don't know.
Where?

11:06.466 --> 11:07.966
It wasn't the plan
to take them.

11:07.968 --> 11:09.034
No, the plan was to kill them.

11:09.036 --> 11:10.101
I'm telling you,

11:10.103 --> 11:11.169
I don't know where they are.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.470
How do I find hassan?

11:12.472 --> 11:13.638
You should have left this alone.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.306
You think you can
hide from us?

11:15.308 --> 11:17.942
We found you once before.
We will find you again.

11:17.944 --> 11:20.612
Wherever you go,
you will never be safe.

11:20.614 --> 11:23.114
(groaning)

11:23.116 --> 11:25.650
Anything happens to my family,
and I'll kill you,

11:25.652 --> 11:28.153
If it takes me
the rest of my life.

11:28.155 --> 11:29.554
Where?!

11:29.556 --> 11:30.488
Martin, enough!

11:30.490 --> 11:32.657
(choking)

11:32.659 --> 11:34.125
(bashir choking)

11:34.127 --> 11:36.795
(groaning and gasping)

11:36.797 --> 11:40.999
(bashir gasps loudly, coughs)

11:41.001 --> 11:42.867
Crystal:
Sit down, mr. Bashir.

11:44.370 --> 11:45.670
(gasping)

11:45.672 --> 11:48.573
Sit down!
(panting)

11:48.575 --> 11:50.675
Crystal:
What is

11:50.677 --> 11:51.743
The desert code?

11:51.745 --> 11:53.645
Is it an eye
for an eye?

11:53.647 --> 11:55.180
A child for a child?

11:55.182 --> 11:56.881
You have a daughter--

11:56.883 --> 11:58.750
Samara-- she lives
with her mother

11:58.752 --> 12:00.285
In washington,
isn't that right?

12:02.822 --> 12:04.923
Uh...

12:04.925 --> 12:07.258
You threatened to kill all of us
and our families.

12:07.260 --> 12:10.662
Why the hell wouldn't I kill
your daughter?

12:15.668 --> 12:17.502
You can't.

12:18.704 --> 12:19.938
You're fbi.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.406
Oh, I guess
we're handling things

12:21.408 --> 12:24.375
In a more unofficial capacity.

12:24.377 --> 12:25.744
Crystal:
Who do you work for?

12:25.746 --> 12:28.713
No, they'll kill me.

12:28.715 --> 12:31.583
Who told you
martin was fbi?

12:33.719 --> 12:35.820
Who was it? Huh?

12:36.922 --> 12:38.556
Crystal:
We can find her anytime we want.

12:38.558 --> 12:42.260
Who leaked
martin's identity?

12:45.064 --> 12:46.698
Arcadia.

12:46.700 --> 12:48.633
Crystal: Arcadia
knew martin was fbi.

12:51.904 --> 12:53.772
Crystal:
Testify...

12:53.774 --> 12:56.775
And your daughter will get
to sleep through the night.

12:56.777 --> 13:00.044
No deal unless you tell me
where my wife and son are.

13:06.085 --> 13:07.952
I don't know.

13:12.091 --> 13:15.226
I promise you, I don't.

13:16.662 --> 13:17.962
Crystal:
<i>Unfortunately...</i>

13:17.964 --> 13:20.565
I think bashir's
telling the truth.

13:22.168 --> 13:24.636
Martin, we're doing everything
we can to find sonya and aiden.

13:24.638 --> 13:26.571
No, we should've never let
hassan go in the first place.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.640
We didn't have
the grounds to hold him.

13:28.642 --> 13:29.641
It's all about arcadia.

13:29.643 --> 13:30.842
I mean, who are these guys?

13:30.844 --> 13:31.943
Some type of think tank?

13:31.945 --> 13:33.578
How'd they know
martin was fbi?

13:33.580 --> 13:35.747
Maggie: Arcadia is controlled
by a management group

13:35.749 --> 13:37.448
Headed by a guy
named jason shaw.

13:37.450 --> 13:39.651
Shaw. I've heard of him.

13:39.653 --> 13:41.319
Maggie: Spent seven years
with the green berets,

13:41.321 --> 13:42.620
And then the deltas,
before he went into business.

13:42.622 --> 13:44.088
I don't care
who the hell he is,

13:44.090 --> 13:46.491
We need to slap his ass
with a subpoena.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.126
Maggie:
Hold on, there's more.

13:48.128 --> 13:50.862
Jason shaw is also
the ceo of verax.

13:50.864 --> 13:53.498
Arcadia was acquired by verax
three years ago.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.034
Verax, the military contractor.

13:58.103 --> 14:00.438
Did I work for verax?

14:00.440 --> 14:02.774
When I was in iraq?

14:02.776 --> 14:04.809
Martin, we have been
over this...

14:04.811 --> 14:06.945
Is that how
they found me?

14:06.947 --> 14:08.146
Is that how they found my son?

14:08.148 --> 14:09.614
You were not in iraq.

14:09.616 --> 14:12.350
You were the one
who was telling me to drop it.

14:12.352 --> 14:16.154
Mccombs, evans, dobson--
you said it was all in my head,

14:16.156 --> 14:17.288
But it's not, is it?

14:17.290 --> 14:19.958
Did I work for verax?

14:23.696 --> 14:25.129
This is my family, nelson.

14:25.131 --> 14:27.131
I want the truth, damn it.

14:27.133 --> 14:28.633
My office.

14:29.969 --> 14:31.870
Now.

14:40.246 --> 14:42.981
Did I work for verax?

14:42.983 --> 14:44.315
Is that why
they targeted me?

14:44.317 --> 14:47.051
Is that how bashir knew
I was fbi?

14:48.053 --> 14:49.587
Yes.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.489
You worked for verax.

14:51.491 --> 14:54.192
And yes, you were in iraq.

14:54.194 --> 14:57.829
Ah... Eight years.

14:57.831 --> 14:59.864
Eight years
we've been friends.

14:59.866 --> 15:02.000
You've been lying to me.
You've been lying to me!

15:02.002 --> 15:03.034
Sit down.

15:03.036 --> 15:04.769
You knew all along!

15:04.771 --> 15:06.004
Please.
You knew, nelson!

15:06.006 --> 15:08.239
Sit down.

15:12.778 --> 15:16.614
I ran witsec operations
before dco.

15:16.616 --> 15:19.183
I was an eraser,
helping people disappear.

15:19.185 --> 15:23.521
In 2004, the director of
the bureau handed me your case.

15:23.523 --> 15:26.057
They said that you'd
been in an accident.

15:26.059 --> 15:27.392
Head injury.

15:27.394 --> 15:28.760
You looked like you'd
been through hell.

15:28.762 --> 15:32.931
Because I'd been in iraq.

15:32.933 --> 15:35.433
I assumed.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.268
They didn't give me details.

15:37.270 --> 15:38.770
I didn't know your name.

15:38.772 --> 15:40.605
They just said that I had
to protect you.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.774
And that your life was
in danger.

15:44.276 --> 15:46.711
So...

15:46.713 --> 15:49.213
"martin odum" is a legend.

15:51.483 --> 15:52.884
Yes.

16:10.836 --> 16:13.638
(whispering):
Mom.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.139
How did you
get that?

16:15.141 --> 16:16.307
You dropped it
in the bathroom,

16:16.309 --> 16:18.076
I was able to
pick it up.

16:18.078 --> 16:19.077
Good boy.

16:19.079 --> 16:20.812
I don't know
your passcode.

16:20.814 --> 16:23.781
Seven, two, zero, five.

16:23.783 --> 16:25.016
Your birthday.

16:30.155 --> 16:31.823
Dad's gonna
save us, mom.

16:32.624 --> 16:32.991
I know he will.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.863
Why go to all that trouble
to hide the truth?

16:38.865 --> 16:40.164
To protect you.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.467
Protect me from who?

16:42.469 --> 16:44.035
I don't know.

16:44.037 --> 16:45.536
It's classified.

16:49.274 --> 16:51.943
At the highest levels.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.713
I suspect the answers
are in here.

17:04.056 --> 17:06.491
"operation raining fire."

17:06.493 --> 17:09.327
I keep remembering pieces of it.

17:09.329 --> 17:11.129
In my dreams.

17:11.131 --> 17:13.564
When I get headaches.

17:15.467 --> 17:17.135
What about sonya?

17:22.307 --> 17:24.409
Is she a part of it?

17:29.014 --> 17:31.582
I have to know, nelson.

17:33.419 --> 17:36.721
Let's just find her and aiden.

17:36.723 --> 17:39.090
Then you can ask her yourself.

17:40.325 --> 17:42.393
(cell phone buzzing)

17:47.666 --> 17:49.200
Maggie:
The phone is still active.

17:49.202 --> 17:51.736
That makes it easier
to triangulate the signal.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.104
Come on, maggie.

17:53.106 --> 17:55.106
I'm working as
fast as I can.

17:57.042 --> 17:59.010
There-- that's
a small airport. See it?

17:59.012 --> 18:00.878
Crystal: Using a private charter
to fly 'em out?

18:00.880 --> 18:01.779
That's ambitious.

18:01.781 --> 18:03.281
Gates:
Call the faa.

18:03.283 --> 18:05.116
I want all small
aircraft grounded.

18:05.118 --> 18:07.285
Hold on, maggie-- isolate that
neighborhood right next to it.

18:10.022 --> 18:12.023
Now, see, I know
that place.

18:12.025 --> 18:13.357
We ran narco raids
out of there.

18:13.359 --> 18:14.692
The builder ran
out of money,

18:14.694 --> 18:15.960
Left all those houses
unfinished.

18:15.962 --> 18:16.961
That's where they are,
got to be.

18:16.963 --> 18:18.096
Gates:
Maggie, alert tactical.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.464
I'm not waiting
for them.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.241
Gates:
Maggie isolated the signal.

18:30.243 --> 18:32.710
The address is 1519 drexel.

18:32.712 --> 18:35.546
And crystal, put 'em to sleep.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.381
Crystal:
Copy that.

18:40.219 --> 18:41.919
You coming or not?

18:41.921 --> 18:43.888
I'll take the back,
you cover him.

18:45.290 --> 18:48.226
â™ª I kill the light,
but the lies are sleepless â™ª

18:48.228 --> 18:51.329
â™ª night heaves
with the bleakest secrets â™ª

18:51.331 --> 18:54.999
â™ª a shadow waits in the black

18:55.001 --> 18:58.836
â™ª and I awake with a devil
on my back â™ª

18:58.838 --> 19:00.905
â™ª I'm contesting
my reckless weakness â™ª

19:00.907 --> 19:04.942
â™ª desperately wrestling
restless demons â™ª

19:04.944 --> 19:07.245
â™ª but all the odds are stacked

19:07.247 --> 19:10.781
â™ª guess I'm no match
for the devil on my back â™ª

19:10.783 --> 19:13.151
â™ª and I plead for my peace,
like a dead man walking â™ª

19:13.153 --> 19:16.821
â™ª and I plead for my peace,
like a dead man walking â™ª

19:16.823 --> 19:19.824
â™ª and I plead for my peace,
like a dead man walking â™ª

19:19.826 --> 19:23.094
â™ª and I plead for my peace,
like a dead man walking â™ª

19:26.431 --> 19:30.101
â™ª

19:56.361 --> 19:57.962
Crystal: Sonya, we want
to move you and aiden

19:57.964 --> 20:00.031
To a safe house
until this is over.

20:01.366 --> 20:03.968
Why can't we just stay with you
for the time being?

20:03.970 --> 20:07.004
That's not secure enough,
in my opinion.

20:07.006 --> 20:10.875
You'd be better off
in the safe house, sonya.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.977
You're gonna come with us,
right, dad?
I can't tonight,

20:12.979 --> 20:15.813
But, uh... I'll, uh, I'll be
there as soon as I can.

20:15.815 --> 20:17.181
I promise you that.

20:17.183 --> 20:18.983
I'm gonna have balasco drive
sonya and aiden.

20:18.985 --> 20:22.753
No, I want someone I can trust.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.322
Tony.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.624
You got it.

20:41.940 --> 20:44.041
That's sebastian egan.

20:44.043 --> 20:47.278
He's a journalist that was
on the hani jibril expose.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.447
This is who
the saudis went after.

20:49.449 --> 20:52.183
This story is just
one big russian doll.

20:52.185 --> 20:54.552
Len barlow,
roughneck.

20:54.554 --> 20:56.287
He was the one
that kidnapped

20:56.289 --> 20:57.788
Our verax field operative
in houston-- kyle dobson.

20:57.790 --> 21:00.591
Dobson was in basra
when it all went to hell.

21:00.593 --> 21:03.261
We had to contain that situation
when dobson became a liability.

21:04.896 --> 21:07.398
So, four aliases?

21:07.400 --> 21:09.567
Well, that we know of.

21:09.569 --> 21:11.135
But what we do know is

21:11.137 --> 21:13.037
That they're all investigating
aspects of our operation.

21:13.039 --> 21:17.375
Our source on the inside
said he's fbi, dco.

21:17.377 --> 21:18.909
His real name is martin odum.

21:18.911 --> 21:21.479
Agent martin odum.

21:21.481 --> 21:24.248
Or whatever he calls himself.

21:24.250 --> 21:26.284
I've been looking for this
son of a bitch for ten years.

21:26.286 --> 21:27.685
You know him?

21:29.221 --> 21:31.789
This could work for us.

21:33.492 --> 21:35.660
Bring me martin odum.

21:35.662 --> 21:39.297
Tell the boys,
"be ready for a fight."

21:48.473 --> 21:50.007
Crystal:
Martin?

21:50.009 --> 21:51.509
Hi.
I didn't expect
to see you this morning.

21:51.511 --> 21:53.077
Well, gates wanted
me at the briefing.

21:53.079 --> 21:54.945
(clears throat)
how are sonya and aiden doing?

21:54.947 --> 21:56.447
They're doing all right.

21:56.449 --> 21:58.349
Spoke to rice on the way in--
nothing to report.

21:58.351 --> 22:00.518
Hey, before we go in there,

22:00.520 --> 22:02.420
You need to know
what's going on.

22:02.422 --> 22:03.788
What do you mean?

22:03.790 --> 22:06.590
I mean someone leaked
that you're fbi.

22:06.592 --> 22:08.159
Your connection to verax.

22:09.428 --> 22:12.163
Operation raining fire.

22:12.165 --> 22:13.597
What is it?

22:13.599 --> 22:15.499
Maggie said you were
looking into it.

22:15.501 --> 22:17.702
I don't know what it's about.

22:17.704 --> 22:18.869
Don't bullshit me.

22:18.871 --> 22:19.970
I'm serious.

22:19.972 --> 22:21.539
They went after your family.

22:21.541 --> 22:23.007
You need to tell us.

22:23.009 --> 22:24.809
I promise I'll fill you in
when I know more.

22:24.811 --> 22:27.345
All right?

22:27.347 --> 22:30.014
The president passes along
his congratulations

22:30.016 --> 22:31.849
In capturing
prince abboud's assassin.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.384
Did I miss something?

22:33.386 --> 22:34.885
Bashir confessed as
part of a plea deal.

22:34.887 --> 22:36.787
The attorney general has set
the deal aside.

22:36.789 --> 22:37.855
Excuse me?

22:37.857 --> 22:38.689
All charges against ms. Jibril

22:38.691 --> 22:39.957
Will be dropped.

22:39.959 --> 22:42.293
Mr. Bashir alone will

22:42.295 --> 22:43.394
Be prosecuted for the crime.

22:43.396 --> 22:45.129
He flipped on his handlers.

22:45.131 --> 22:46.964
I mean, this guy named names--
we're just ignoring that?

22:46.966 --> 22:50.000
Yeah, what about the money trail
that leads to prince fayeen?

22:50.002 --> 22:51.836
They clearly benefit

22:51.838 --> 22:53.237
From abboud being
out of the way.

22:53.239 --> 22:54.872
As I just said,
we will not be pursuing

22:54.874 --> 22:56.707
Charges beyond mr. Bashir.

22:56.709 --> 22:59.043
This is bullshit.

22:59.045 --> 23:01.545
You'll all be
receiving commendations.

23:01.547 --> 23:03.714
Gold stars for keeping
our mouths shut?

23:03.716 --> 23:06.050
Let's call it recognition
from a grateful nation.

23:06.052 --> 23:07.351
Let's call it a cover up.

23:07.353 --> 23:09.820
The director wants dco
off this case.

23:09.822 --> 23:11.389
My suggestion is
that you chalk it up

23:11.391 --> 23:13.491
In the win column
and move on.

23:13.493 --> 23:16.293
This is a disgrace.

23:44.189 --> 23:47.291
Dad?

23:48.860 --> 23:51.295
Dad?

23:53.932 --> 23:56.066
You must need something.

23:56.068 --> 23:57.301
I tried calling.

23:57.303 --> 23:59.403
You don't answer your phone.

23:59.405 --> 24:02.173
I didn't recognize your number.

24:03.375 --> 24:05.376
So...

24:05.378 --> 24:07.244
I'm assuming this is
an official visit?

24:07.246 --> 24:09.780
If that makes you feel better
about me being here.

24:13.151 --> 24:16.320
"operation raining fire"?

24:16.322 --> 24:18.722
How did you get this?

24:18.724 --> 24:21.992
I found it through the
course of an investigation.

24:21.994 --> 24:24.962
I need to get the
original file unredacted.

24:26.465 --> 24:27.998
I tried the proper channels.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.901
Well, I would tell you
to put it back where you got it.

24:30.903 --> 24:32.937
But...
(laughs)

24:32.939 --> 24:35.105
I gave up trying to lecture you
a long time ago.

24:35.107 --> 24:38.809
Dad, do we have to go
through this every time?

24:38.811 --> 24:40.478
And you want me to give you

24:40.480 --> 24:43.914
A highly classified military
intelligence file.

24:43.916 --> 24:45.916
You were still head of
naval intelligence in '04

24:45.918 --> 24:47.351
When raining fire happened.

24:49.921 --> 24:51.856
You know about
this, don't you?

24:51.858 --> 24:54.658
I wish I didn't.

24:55.827 --> 24:57.695
A friend of mine's in trouble.

24:57.697 --> 24:59.663
I think that he
was part of this.

25:01.833 --> 25:04.368
Dad, please...

25:04.370 --> 25:07.171
It wasn't easy for me to come
here and ask you for this.

25:07.173 --> 25:09.306
Long drive, I imagine.

25:09.308 --> 25:11.809
I took a chopper actually.

25:11.811 --> 25:12.977
I'm busy.

25:12.979 --> 25:15.179
(quiet laugh)

25:18.216 --> 25:21.018
Operation raining fire.

25:22.687 --> 25:24.455
All right.

25:24.457 --> 25:26.390
I'll tell you what I know.

25:39.838 --> 25:42.373
Martin, you almost
gave me a heart attack.

25:42.375 --> 25:45.042
That'd be unfortunate.

25:45.044 --> 25:47.378
I haven't asked you
a single question yet.

25:53.351 --> 25:55.553
What's with the piece?

25:56.688 --> 25:58.622
Oh, the gun's to make sure
you answer.

26:00.392 --> 26:01.992
Sit down.

26:01.994 --> 26:04.895
What's on your mind?

26:06.064 --> 26:08.866
Saudi agents knew
I was undercover fbi.

26:08.868 --> 26:10.234
How'd they find that out?

26:10.236 --> 26:11.902
I don't know.

26:11.904 --> 26:15.573
I was made by someone
on the inside.

26:17.509 --> 26:19.510
And the leak didn't come
from dco.

26:19.512 --> 26:21.412
That puts you

26:21.414 --> 26:23.514
And milloy at the top
of the list.

26:23.516 --> 26:25.883
Just milloy.

26:25.885 --> 26:27.251
Not me.

26:27.253 --> 26:30.354
I don't see much light
between you two.

26:30.356 --> 26:32.756
Like when you're
whitewashing a case.

26:34.192 --> 26:36.060
See it for what it is.

26:36.062 --> 26:38.062
At this level,
if you don't play the game...

26:38.064 --> 26:40.064
You're dead.

26:40.066 --> 26:42.266
I'm not working for verax.

26:42.268 --> 26:43.601
For the past five years,

26:43.603 --> 26:45.636
I've been tracking
their covert activities.

26:45.638 --> 26:47.638
Their ops, their renditions...

26:47.640 --> 26:50.474
Their domestic assassinations.

27:00.318 --> 27:01.986
Check up in that cabinet.

27:01.988 --> 27:03.454
There's a black accordion file.

27:03.456 --> 27:05.856
See for yourself.

27:39.190 --> 27:41.392
I'm on your side, agent.

27:45.430 --> 27:47.931
I'm not sure I'm on yours yet.

27:47.933 --> 27:49.366
Look, I know

27:49.368 --> 27:52.202
"martin odum" is a legend.

27:52.204 --> 27:53.671
You want to know
who you are.

27:53.673 --> 27:55.706
If I knew,
I would tell you.

27:55.708 --> 27:58.008
But verax does know.

27:58.010 --> 28:00.611
They were in iraq 2004.

28:00.613 --> 28:02.112
Ring a bell?

28:08.053 --> 28:09.987
I want to bring verax down.

28:09.989 --> 28:11.555
You want answers.

28:11.557 --> 28:13.791
Maybe we could help
each other.

28:17.729 --> 28:21.165
I wasn't involved with operation
raining fire directly, but...

28:21.167 --> 28:23.634
You hear things
in certain circles.

28:23.636 --> 28:25.402
What was it?

28:25.404 --> 28:26.704
Far as I can tell,

28:26.706 --> 28:28.238
It was a cover up.

28:28.240 --> 28:30.474
Probably the worst

28:30.476 --> 28:33.377
Friendly fire incident
during the entire iraq war.

28:33.379 --> 28:34.812
"friendly fire"?

28:34.814 --> 28:36.413
We bombed our own position.

28:36.415 --> 28:37.314
Oh...

28:37.316 --> 28:39.083
Total devastation.

28:39.085 --> 28:42.319
I heard almost 400 dead.

28:42.321 --> 28:44.088
It might've been more.

28:44.090 --> 28:45.422
My god.

28:45.424 --> 28:47.891
Wiped out a platoon of marines.

28:47.893 --> 28:49.326
Most of the dead
were contractors

28:49.328 --> 28:51.195
For a company called verax.

28:51.197 --> 28:54.064
"verax"?

28:54.066 --> 28:55.766
No kidding.

28:55.768 --> 28:57.434
Who covered it up?

28:57.436 --> 29:00.370
Now, we're talking about the
highest echelon of the military.

29:00.372 --> 29:01.905
Pentagon e-ring.

29:01.907 --> 29:03.407
I couldn't give
you names, crystal.

29:03.409 --> 29:04.908
These people don't use names.

29:04.910 --> 29:07.044
So, why would verax
go along with it?

29:07.046 --> 29:09.113
Because they wanted
it hushed up, too.

29:09.115 --> 29:10.781
Spiller:
<i>Whole directorates</i>

29:10.783 --> 29:14.017
Of the state department
have been corrupted by verax.

29:14.019 --> 29:16.019
They own votes in congress,

29:16.021 --> 29:18.122
Run lobbyists in k street.

29:18.124 --> 29:20.791
No military appropriation goes
through without their support.

29:20.793 --> 29:22.593
What's this?

29:22.595 --> 29:24.194
"ensign."

29:24.196 --> 29:26.630
It's a private intelligence
agency under contract

29:26.632 --> 29:28.198
To the nsa.

29:28.200 --> 29:30.234
Owned by verax, run by ex-spies.

29:30.236 --> 29:33.203
Verax has a private cia?

29:33.205 --> 29:34.738
(short laugh)

29:34.740 --> 29:35.773
And a private military.

29:35.775 --> 29:38.909
And a policy group with arcadia.

29:38.911 --> 29:39.910
You see what they're doing.

29:39.912 --> 29:40.978
Trying to shift the balance

29:40.980 --> 29:42.880
Of power in the country.

29:42.882 --> 29:45.115
Our details are sketchy,
but our intel suggests

29:45.117 --> 29:46.416
That they may be
planning some kind

29:46.418 --> 29:47.751
Of false flag terrorist attack

29:47.753 --> 29:49.453
Against the United States.

29:49.455 --> 29:51.088
Why?

29:51.090 --> 29:53.824
Funding for a spy satellite is
bogged down in congress.

29:53.826 --> 29:55.159
The project needs an extra push.

29:55.161 --> 29:57.728
Stage a terrorist attack,

29:57.730 --> 30:00.330
Verax gets their satellite.

30:00.332 --> 30:02.566
New world order is sick.

30:10.909 --> 30:12.142
Who is he?

30:12.144 --> 30:13.443
John cameron.

30:13.445 --> 30:15.145
At least that's
who we think he is.

30:15.147 --> 30:17.314
He's their number one
covert agent.

30:17.316 --> 30:18.982
Other than that,
we don't know much about him.

30:18.984 --> 30:23.086
Do you think he's the one
who's staging the attack?

30:23.088 --> 30:25.022
I want you to find cameron

30:25.024 --> 30:26.490
And stop him
from what he's doing.

30:26.492 --> 30:27.958
No matter what it takes.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.159
And by the way,

30:29.161 --> 30:30.828
He was there

30:30.830 --> 30:33.497
In iraq in 2004.

30:33.499 --> 30:35.132
Operation raining fire.

30:35.134 --> 30:37.000
If anyone knows

30:37.002 --> 30:39.837
Who you are, he does.

31:01.459 --> 31:03.093
Porter:
Beautiful country out here.

31:09.467 --> 31:12.803
Sources tell me our saudi friend
bashir is in custody...

31:12.805 --> 31:15.038
Spilling his guts.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.907
Look, I'm just
as upset about it.

31:16.909 --> 31:19.810
But we're managing the situation
through the usual assets.

31:19.812 --> 31:20.911
Okay.

31:20.913 --> 31:23.814
We're going
to hang the plot

31:23.816 --> 31:25.515
Squarely on bashir.

31:25.517 --> 31:28.085
Paint him as a zealot

31:28.087 --> 31:29.319
Who worked alone.

31:29.321 --> 31:31.321
And our connection
to prince fayeen

31:31.323 --> 31:33.991
Will be suppressed.

31:33.993 --> 31:35.525
'cause, I mean, you understand

31:35.527 --> 31:37.828
That this is an important moment

31:37.830 --> 31:40.197
In our business.

31:40.199 --> 31:42.332
We can't afford
any... Blowback.

31:42.334 --> 31:44.368
The situation's
already a little...

31:44.370 --> 31:45.502
Too close for comfort.

31:45.504 --> 31:46.603
(rifle cocks)

31:46.605 --> 31:48.572
I understand the optics.

31:48.574 --> 31:50.507
If you understood
the optics,

31:50.509 --> 31:52.509
Then why did it happen?

31:55.847 --> 31:57.214
Look...

31:57.216 --> 31:58.415
Tomlin's gonna take over

31:58.417 --> 31:59.950
Some of your responsibilities.

31:59.952 --> 32:01.852
Okay?

32:01.854 --> 32:03.520
Yes, sir.

32:03.522 --> 32:05.188
I understand.

32:05.190 --> 32:07.958
All right.

32:07.960 --> 32:10.160
So... Have a nice flight back.

32:31.049 --> 32:32.849
(gunshot)

32:33.618 --> 32:35.052
(body thuds)

32:44.729 --> 32:46.964
That had to be done.

32:56.174 --> 32:59.142
Agent (over radio): Fbi agent
odum approaching; he's clear.

33:09.988 --> 33:11.688
Hey, tony.

33:11.690 --> 33:13.090
Hey.

33:14.759 --> 33:15.692
How you holding up?

33:15.694 --> 33:17.127
I'm fine.

33:17.129 --> 33:19.262
Where's sonya?

33:19.264 --> 33:20.530
Oh, she's putting
aiden to bed.

33:20.532 --> 33:23.433
You know, he beat me
three times at gin?

33:23.435 --> 33:25.035
(chuckles)
sharp kid.

33:25.037 --> 33:26.303
Yeah, well, he cheated, so...

33:26.305 --> 33:28.372
You better watch out.

33:30.808 --> 33:32.342
Well, I guess
I better get going.

33:32.344 --> 33:34.277
You know, it's been a long day.

33:34.279 --> 33:36.113
Sure.
Sure, I'll see you out.

33:36.115 --> 33:38.048
Where's your family?

33:38.050 --> 33:40.217
At my cousin's.
You know, she's a cop,

33:40.219 --> 33:41.551
So I figure that's
the safest place

33:41.553 --> 33:42.786
Till all this
blows over, you know?

33:43.654 --> 33:46.323
Aiden's finally asleep.

33:46.325 --> 33:47.791
He was so wound up from the day.

33:47.793 --> 33:49.860
Yeah. I'm sure he is.

33:49.862 --> 33:51.361
Well, thanks, tony,

33:51.363 --> 33:53.697
For, uh...
Well, for everything.

33:54.732 --> 33:57.300
Yeah. Thank you.

34:20.591 --> 34:22.259
It's nice being a family again.

34:22.261 --> 34:24.661
Even playing gin rummy

34:24.663 --> 34:25.829
Under armed guard.

34:27.565 --> 34:29.933
You should quit your job
and come home again.

34:29.935 --> 34:32.502
Yeah...

34:32.504 --> 34:34.371
It won't be
like this forever.

34:34.373 --> 34:36.540
Well, let's go away.

34:36.542 --> 34:37.707
The three of us.

34:37.709 --> 34:39.609
Together, we'll be fine.

34:43.047 --> 34:44.948
Where'd you learn
how to handle yourself?

34:45.750 --> 34:47.084
What do you mean?

34:47.086 --> 34:49.519
Well, that-that move
you did earlier.

34:49.521 --> 34:50.687
You smashed that guy's ribs.

34:50.689 --> 34:52.622
Never seen you do

34:52.624 --> 34:53.790
Anything like that before.

34:53.792 --> 34:56.026
I reacted to protect aiden.

34:56.028 --> 34:57.694
Oh, yeah?

34:57.696 --> 34:59.362
While you were gone,

34:59.364 --> 35:00.564
I took a self-defense class.

35:00.566 --> 35:02.065
Oh, yeah?
One self-defense class,

35:02.067 --> 35:05.202
You knock out a trained killer?
Yeah?

35:06.471 --> 35:08.305
You're being paranoid.

35:08.307 --> 35:10.207
I'm not being paranoid.

35:10.209 --> 35:11.208
In 2004,

35:11.210 --> 35:12.542
I wasn't in a car accident.

35:12.544 --> 35:14.211
I was in iraq.

35:14.213 --> 35:15.212
Iraq?

35:15.214 --> 35:16.480
Yeah.

35:16.482 --> 35:18.782
Mm-hmm.
Listen to
yourself, martin.

35:18.784 --> 35:21.118
You're confused.
You're sick.

35:21.120 --> 35:23.887
I'm not sick.
I'm being lied to.

35:24.822 --> 35:26.456
When I woke up
in the hospital,

35:26.458 --> 35:28.225
You said I'd been
in a car accident.

35:28.227 --> 35:32.395
I had no memory
of my life before.

35:32.397 --> 35:35.232
You and gates helped me to
put my past back together.

35:35.234 --> 35:37.334
I was martin odum.

35:37.336 --> 35:39.636
But the pieces don't
make sense, sonya.

35:39.638 --> 35:41.171
I'm starting to
remember things.

35:41.173 --> 35:43.073
Yeah. Real things.

35:43.075 --> 35:44.941
You've been undercover
too long, martin.

35:44.943 --> 35:46.643
No, you tell me
the truth, damn it!

35:46.645 --> 35:48.178
Who was I? Huh?

35:48.180 --> 35:49.579
I don't...
Who was I before?

35:50.414 --> 35:52.282
I don't know.

35:52.284 --> 35:54.351
I don't want to know.

35:54.353 --> 35:56.786
I fell in love with you.

35:56.788 --> 35:58.421
Martin...

35:58.423 --> 36:00.891
I don't want
to lose you, please.

36:02.293 --> 36:03.994
I'm scared if
I tell you the truth,

36:03.996 --> 36:05.996
You won't love me anymore.

36:08.199 --> 36:10.100
It's okay...

36:19.810 --> 36:22.078
Where's the guard?

36:22.947 --> 36:24.414
Get down.
(gunshots)

36:26.217 --> 36:27.651
Mom!

36:27.653 --> 36:29.452
Dad!
I gotta
get aiden.

36:29.454 --> 36:31.054
Aiden:
Mom!

36:31.056 --> 36:32.022
Man (through megaphone):
Martin odum, you are surrounded.

36:32.024 --> 36:33.857
Get down.
Get under the bed now.

36:33.859 --> 36:36.359
Don't come out until
I come back and get you.

36:36.361 --> 36:38.028
You're gonna get me, right?
I promise.

36:38.030 --> 36:39.663
Man (over megaphone):
Throw out your weapon

36:39.665 --> 36:41.164
And give yourself up.

36:41.166 --> 36:42.566
Martin, back door.

36:42.568 --> 36:44.634
Man (over megaphone):
Let your family live.

36:57.415 --> 36:59.282
Give me a gun.

37:00.318 --> 37:01.718
Give me a gun!

37:03.854 --> 37:04.988
Here.

37:04.990 --> 37:07.023
Call rice.

37:07.025 --> 37:08.291
Tell him to send backup.

37:12.363 --> 37:16.399
(gunfire)

37:44.695 --> 37:46.930
â™ª

38:14.892 --> 38:16.393
Sonya (grunts):
Martin!

38:17.828 --> 38:19.462
(grunts)

38:22.266 --> 38:23.366
I've been hit.

38:24.568 --> 38:25.802
No...

38:26.937 --> 38:29.372
Hang on, honey.

38:39.317 --> 38:42.052
â™ª

38:43.854 --> 38:44.921
You're gonna be
okay, sonya.

38:44.923 --> 38:46.156
Where's aiden?

38:46.158 --> 38:47.791
Don't worry,
I'll take care of him.

38:47.793 --> 38:48.992
Thanks.

38:56.467 --> 38:57.600
How far to the hospital?

38:57.602 --> 38:58.702
Paramedic:
We're eight minutes out.

38:58.704 --> 39:00.870
Keep pressure on that wound.

39:00.872 --> 39:02.005
Why did you lie to me?

39:02.007 --> 39:04.274
I'm so sorry.

39:04.276 --> 39:06.509
I know you were
struggling.

39:07.511 --> 39:09.946
I wanted to tell you
for so long.

39:09.948 --> 39:11.448
Then tell me now.

39:11.450 --> 39:13.883
Tell me now, please.

39:13.885 --> 39:16.186
In 2004,

39:16.188 --> 39:18.121
I was an agent for the cia.

39:18.123 --> 39:21.057
Stationed
in germany.

39:21.059 --> 39:24.060
I was assigned to help
an mi6 operative

39:24.062 --> 39:25.795
Who had been injured
during the war.

39:25.797 --> 39:28.031
I was in mi6?

39:28.033 --> 39:29.332
Wh... What?

39:29.334 --> 39:32.502
I was ordered to get you
to the u.S.

39:32.504 --> 39:33.803
And make you disappear.

39:33.805 --> 39:34.904
Why?

39:34.906 --> 39:36.873
To protect you.

39:36.875 --> 39:38.975
When I met you
in the hospital,

39:38.977 --> 39:40.810
You had massive brain trauma.

39:40.812 --> 39:42.011
Severe memory loss.

39:42.013 --> 39:43.980
I was told to
prevent you

39:43.982 --> 39:46.683
From ever knowing what happened.

39:46.685 --> 39:48.985
To keep you from ever...

39:48.987 --> 39:50.754
Ever finding out who you were.

39:50.756 --> 39:52.989
All this...

39:53.991 --> 39:55.191
You, aiden...

39:55.193 --> 39:57.394
It's all been a lie.

39:57.396 --> 39:59.629
Hasn't it?
It's all been a lie.

40:01.766 --> 40:04.667
It was a lie.

40:06.904 --> 40:08.838
But it became real.

40:10.207 --> 40:13.143
I fell in love with you, martin.

40:15.913 --> 40:18.915
And then we had
our beautiful boy.

40:21.552 --> 40:24.020
I quit the agency

40:24.022 --> 40:26.723
To have a family.

40:26.725 --> 40:27.891
Have a real life.

40:27.893 --> 40:30.093
With you.

40:32.062 --> 40:34.697
Just tell me who I am.

40:34.699 --> 40:36.900
Tell me, what's my name?

40:36.902 --> 40:38.601
Please.

40:38.603 --> 40:40.603
I wasn't allowed to know.

40:43.240 --> 40:45.875
I fell in love with <i>you,</i>

40:45.877 --> 40:48.878
Not the man you were before.

40:53.584 --> 40:54.818
(alarms beeping)

40:54.820 --> 40:56.553
(flatline tone)
she's crashing.

40:56.555 --> 40:57.587
Sonya...
Out of the way, sir.

40:57.589 --> 40:59.222
Out of the way, sir!
Sonya...

41:00.124 --> 41:01.758
Stay with me.
Sonya?
Ma'am.

41:01.760 --> 41:03.460
(flatline tone continues)

41:03.462 --> 41:05.228
Please...

41:05.230 --> 41:06.463
Please don't leave me.

41:06.465 --> 41:08.231
Please.

41:08.233 --> 41:10.467
Stay with me.

41:14.572 --> 41:16.739
(siren wails distantly)

41:21.412 --> 41:25.748
