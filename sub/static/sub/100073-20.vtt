00:01.984 --> 00:03.318
You can't be faithful to a girl,

00:03.320 --> 00:05.346
you can't be faithful
to an oath or a badge.

00:05.348 --> 00:06.377
I'll drink to that.

00:06.379 --> 00:09.314
I interviewed for my
dream job. I got it.

00:09.316 --> 00:11.783
- That's great!
- It's in New York.

00:11.785 --> 00:14.119
Rosalind Dyer,
the most rare of unicorns...

00:14.121 --> 00:15.454
a female serial killer.

00:15.456 --> 00:17.289
I led the task force
that caught Rosalind.

00:17.291 --> 00:18.624
Don't let me off that easy!

00:18.626 --> 00:20.459
My wife was dying! I wasn't there!

00:20.461 --> 00:22.461
I do know one last secret.

00:22.463 --> 00:25.464
- I don't care.
- It's about Armstrong. And it is bad.

00:25.466 --> 00:27.900
Name names, okay? Just testify.

00:27.902 --> 00:29.768
Armstrong.

00:29.770 --> 00:30.936
Armstrong.

00:30.938 --> 00:33.505
She said his name before she saw him.

00:33.507 --> 00:35.774
_

00:39.800 --> 00:43.315
_

00:49.290 --> 00:50.993
Hollywood division is in pursuit

00:50.995 --> 00:52.398
after a shots fired call.

00:52.400 --> 00:54.563
Uh, gr... gray Maserati, no plates.

00:54.565 --> 00:56.032
Suspect vehicle is picking up speed.

00:56.034 --> 00:57.200
He's... He's blowing lights.

00:57.202 --> 00:59.069
Sidewalk! Sidewalk!
He's on the sidewalk!

00:59.071 --> 01:00.738
- Wait. That voice.
- We are lead car.

01:00.740 --> 01:02.362
- That's Chris.
- I'm gonna need backup, guys!

01:02.364 --> 01:03.519
We went to the Academy together.

01:03.521 --> 01:05.721
- Hey, get back! Get back!
- Hands! Hands on the window!

01:09.932 --> 01:11.031
Okay, keep breathing.

01:11.033 --> 01:12.599
7-Adam-07, shots fired.

01:12.601 --> 01:14.601
Officer down. Repeat, officer down.

01:20.375 --> 01:22.776
Hey. Not a good time right now.

01:22.778 --> 01:24.211
Serj just shot a cop.

01:25.263 --> 01:26.285
That was him?

01:26.287 --> 01:27.343
If he can escape...

01:27.345 --> 01:29.049
Escape? Ruben, come on.

01:29.051 --> 01:32.786
Even if he gets clear,
10,000 cops are hunting him.

01:32.788 --> 01:35.322
Attention all units,
Air-12 spotted a gray Maserati

01:35.324 --> 01:36.623
matching suspect's vehicle

01:36.625 --> 01:39.492
entering covered parking
structure at 6th and Grand.

01:39.494 --> 01:41.661
They just spotted his
car, man. He's cooked.

01:41.663 --> 01:43.230
Well, if he's cooked, then so are you.

01:43.232 --> 01:44.497
- You understand?
- Ruben!

01:44.499 --> 01:46.800
Damn it!

01:46.802 --> 01:48.635
There.

01:51.196 --> 01:52.251
Got a gun.

01:52.253 --> 01:54.107
You need to secure it while
I go after the suspect.

01:54.109 --> 01:55.675
Control, 7-Adam-15.

01:55.677 --> 01:56.810
Suspect vehicle located

01:56.812 --> 01:59.412
in a parking structure on 6th and Grand.

01:59.414 --> 02:01.948
Gun on scene. Need backup. Code 3.

02:01.950 --> 02:03.850
Control, 7-Adam-15.

02:03.852 --> 02:05.652
Shut down all Code 3 units.

02:05.654 --> 02:06.820
Suspect is G.O.A.

02:08.824 --> 02:11.781
Hey. I don't know how,
but Serj got away.

02:11.783 --> 02:13.093
'Cause I'm a slippery bitch.

02:13.095 --> 02:15.095
Serj, don't be smug.

02:15.097 --> 02:16.830
You left the damn gun in the car.

02:21.136 --> 02:22.301
It must've slipped out.

02:22.303 --> 02:23.837
Yeah, and when ballistics matches it

02:23.839 --> 02:25.004
to the wounded officer,

02:25.006 --> 02:26.973
you're gonna spend the rest
of your life in Pelican Bay.

02:26.975 --> 02:28.508
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Screw that.

02:28.510 --> 02:29.843
Ruben said you were gonna fix it.

02:29.845 --> 02:32.445
So fix it. We own you.

02:35.984 --> 02:38.385
Okay, if I can make the gun go away,

02:38.387 --> 02:40.387
it'll cripple any case against you.

02:40.389 --> 02:42.245
- What do you think I should do?
- Go to ground.

02:42.247 --> 02:44.870
And don't call me no more. You hear me?

02:44.872 --> 02:46.640
Everything goes through Ruben.

02:47.863 --> 02:48.995
No sign of the suspect?

02:48.997 --> 02:51.698
No, he got away clean. But
we did recover his weapon.

02:51.700 --> 02:52.999
Nine-mil. Recently fired.

02:53.001 --> 02:54.701
Good work. Anything else?

02:54.703 --> 02:58.071
Uh, yes. Car is registered
to a dealership...

02:58.073 --> 02:59.639
International Luxury Auto.

02:59.641 --> 03:01.708
- Stolen?
- Not reported.

03:01.710 --> 03:04.234
We need to run background checks
on the dealership employees.

03:04.236 --> 03:06.501
Already happening, but we
would get a much faster ID

03:06.503 --> 03:08.660
from the mobile fingerprint
unit inside your car.

03:08.662 --> 03:11.119
We pulled a clean print from
the driver's side window.

03:11.121 --> 03:13.052
Uh, yeah. Great.

03:26.392 --> 03:29.669
And just like that,
our suspect has a name.

03:29.671 --> 03:31.404
Serj Derian.

03:31.406 --> 03:33.072
Control, suspect is Serj Derian.

03:33.074 --> 03:35.942
Run a full background check
and alert the Watch Commander.

03:37.402 --> 03:38.946
_

03:40.148 --> 03:43.350
LAPD! Serj Derian,
come out with your hands up!

03:44.753 --> 03:47.187
- Clear!
- Clear!

03:47.189 --> 03:49.222
- You got something?
- Police report.

03:49.224 --> 03:50.924
"Suspect... Serj Derian".

03:50.926 --> 03:52.459
His name is all over these.

03:52.461 --> 03:53.626
Someone inside the department

03:53.628 --> 03:55.585
has been feeding intel
to the Armenian mob.

03:55.587 --> 03:56.976
And by someone, you mean...

03:56.978 --> 03:59.101
A dirty cop.

04:04.514 --> 04:05.848
Still thinking about Grace?

04:07.385 --> 04:08.441
You're a good detective.

04:08.443 --> 04:10.532
You're an easy case.

04:10.534 --> 04:12.624
You know what?

04:12.626 --> 04:13.863
When we get back to the station,

04:13.865 --> 04:15.571
I'm gonna book the evidence,
I'm gonna call her.

04:15.573 --> 04:16.749
Call her?

04:16.750 --> 04:18.218
You better get your ass over there

04:18.220 --> 04:20.553
and tell her in person.

04:23.992 --> 04:26.659
They're putting together a
raid at Ruben Derian's house.

04:26.661 --> 04:29.229
- Is Serj there?
- Only one way to find out.

04:29.231 --> 04:33.266
Control, 7-Adam-15.
Attach us to that ATL.

04:39.381 --> 04:43.881
_

04:51.119 --> 04:52.819
- Any eye on Serj?
- Not yet,

04:52.821 --> 04:54.687
but there's at least a
handful of unknowns inside.

04:54.689 --> 04:57.257
I would put Stapleton, Cole,
and Brady on the 3/4 corner.

04:57.259 --> 04:59.125
Jennings and Sanchez,
they can take the 2 side,

04:59.127 --> 05:01.494
and we'll join in on the stack.

05:01.496 --> 05:03.997
Sorry. Second nature.

05:03.999 --> 05:06.266
All good, sir. You're the
senior detective on site.

05:06.268 --> 05:07.700
Operation is yours.

05:07.702 --> 05:08.736
Okay.

05:09.966 --> 05:11.522
You're acting detective?

05:11.524 --> 05:13.973
- For the day.
- Doing great.

05:13.975 --> 05:16.576
Okay. Stack, fall in.

05:16.578 --> 05:17.844
Suit up.

05:17.846 --> 05:20.179
Redcon 1, let's go. Let's move.

05:24.353 --> 05:25.418
Stand up!

05:25.420 --> 05:27.120
Hands on your head! Turn around!

05:27.122 --> 05:28.578
What can I do for you?

05:28.580 --> 05:30.970
We have a warrant to search
the premises for Serj Derian.

05:30.972 --> 05:32.294
You could have just called.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.295
So much banging and
crashing just to discover

05:35.297 --> 05:37.630
that my brother didn't randomly drop by.

05:37.632 --> 05:39.332
All clear. No sign of Serj.

05:39.334 --> 05:41.868
Mr. Derian, we'd like you to come
with us to the station voluntarily.

05:41.870 --> 05:42.936
Yeah, you bet.

05:42.938 --> 05:45.305
Uh, look, why don't I meet
you guys down there, huh?

05:45.307 --> 05:46.973
There's only a half-hour left.

05:46.975 --> 05:48.708
_

05:54.049 --> 05:56.149
- Best game of the season. Good series.
- _

05:56.151 --> 05:57.884
Tactical master class.

06:02.991 --> 06:04.757
What the hell's going on?

06:04.759 --> 06:06.859
Why was I called to your
station, Code 2 High?

06:06.861 --> 06:09.896
Because they know a cop took Serj's gun

06:09.898 --> 06:12.065
from Nolan's shop during the raid.

06:12.067 --> 06:14.100
They're checking body cameras.

06:14.102 --> 06:16.392
I'm dead. Mine wasn't on.

06:16.394 --> 06:18.551
T-They're gonna know the second
that they check that video.

06:18.553 --> 06:20.239
- Hold it together, Erin.
- Screw that!

06:20.241 --> 06:22.241
I'm the one exposed here.
You have to do something.

06:22.243 --> 06:24.844
I am! And if you do exactly what I say,

06:24.846 --> 06:26.779
you've got a shot at getting away clean.

06:26.781 --> 06:29.950
Ruben's got a half a million
for you, to help you disappear.

06:30.986 --> 06:32.085
You're lying.

06:32.087 --> 06:33.786
No, I'm not.

06:33.788 --> 06:35.021
And with me on the inside

06:35.023 --> 06:37.256
making sure the case
against Serj falls apart,

06:37.258 --> 06:38.925
you just might be able to survive this,

06:38.927 --> 06:43.229
but only if you play it cool, okay?

06:43.231 --> 06:45.131
I'm scared.

06:45.133 --> 06:47.700
I know.

06:47.702 --> 06:50.403
Turn in your body camera
and then get out of here.

06:50.405 --> 06:51.971
But first, leave your cellphone

06:51.973 --> 06:53.796
and anything else they
can use to track you.

06:53.798 --> 06:56.109
You got someplace to go where
you can get off the grid?

06:57.145 --> 06:58.745
Yeah. I do.

06:58.747 --> 07:00.214
Okay. Good.

07:03.805 --> 07:05.952
Don't screw me here, Detective.

07:05.954 --> 07:07.220
I won't.

07:36.785 --> 07:38.751
You told her I'd give
her a half a million?

07:38.753 --> 07:40.153
- Are you crazy?
- Hey, hey,

07:40.155 --> 07:41.854
hey, don't cheap out on me now, Ruben.

07:41.856 --> 07:43.790
- Erin's lost everything.
- Not yet.

07:43.792 --> 07:45.291
Listen to me.

07:45.293 --> 07:47.193
- You don't have to kill her.
- She's weak.

07:47.195 --> 07:48.778
She'll flip the second they catch her,

07:48.780 --> 07:50.062
and she won't just give me up.

07:50.064 --> 07:51.297
She'll give you up, too.

07:51.299 --> 07:53.433
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do. And so do you.

07:53.435 --> 07:56.302
Which is why you're gonna
make sure she stays silent.

07:56.304 --> 07:57.638
Forever.

07:59.774 --> 08:01.441
No. I won't.

08:01.443 --> 08:03.843
I've done a lot of bad things for you,

08:03.845 --> 08:04.911
but I ain't doing that.

08:04.913 --> 08:06.679
Yes, you will, my friend.

08:06.681 --> 08:08.481
Because when you sell me your soul,

08:08.483 --> 08:10.283
you don't get to choose how I use it.

08:10.285 --> 08:11.851
Hey, you... Ruben!

08:11.853 --> 08:13.152
Hey! You...

08:13.154 --> 08:15.354
Alright.

08:15.356 --> 08:17.724
7-William-10, are you clear for a 10-21?

08:17.726 --> 08:19.792
- Code 3.
- 7-William-10.

08:19.794 --> 08:20.993
Clear.

08:20.995 --> 08:22.862
Hey, Nolan. What's up?

08:22.864 --> 08:24.897
We have a possible
location for Erin Cole.

08:24.899 --> 08:26.165
You want in?

08:28.203 --> 08:30.169
Uh, yeah.

08:30.171 --> 08:31.370
Yeah, I want in.

08:31.372 --> 08:33.307
_

08:39.471 --> 08:41.147
- Clear!
- What do we got?

08:41.149 --> 08:43.082
She's on foot. A few steps ahead.

08:43.083 --> 08:44.383
Alright, everybody head inside.

08:44.385 --> 08:47.720
Split up. She could be anywhere.

09:00.001 --> 09:02.902
You know me. Come on.

09:02.904 --> 09:04.203
We've been through a lot together.

09:04.205 --> 09:06.172
You can talk to me. Just talk to me.

09:06.174 --> 09:08.508
I never wanted this.

09:08.510 --> 09:11.244
I had problems. You know?

09:11.246 --> 09:13.412
Debts.

09:13.414 --> 09:16.249
They paid them, and then...
then they owned me.

09:16.251 --> 09:18.050
Who did? The Derians?

09:18.052 --> 09:19.185
Yeah.

09:19.187 --> 09:20.887
And I told Serj I was done,

09:20.889 --> 09:22.922
but he... he pulled a gun

09:22.924 --> 09:25.525
and he tried to kill me
when I wouldn't scare and...

09:25.527 --> 09:28.094
The shots fired call.

09:28.096 --> 09:30.096
Chris is dead because of me.

09:30.098 --> 09:31.999
No, no, no! Wait! No, don't.

09:33.968 --> 09:36.936
It doesn't have to all be for nothing.

09:36.938 --> 09:39.972
Okay, you can start to make this right.

09:39.974 --> 09:41.440
Just...

09:41.442 --> 09:43.409
name names.

09:43.411 --> 09:45.245
Okay? Just testify.

09:46.848 --> 09:47.880
Armstrong.

10:03.598 --> 10:05.298
25-year-old female,

10:05.300 --> 10:07.800
multiple gunshot wounds to the chest.

10:07.802 --> 10:09.902
Not conscious, not breathing.

10:26.487 --> 10:28.454
You did good, my friend.

10:28.456 --> 10:29.488
Very good.

10:32.160 --> 10:34.961
I'm out.

10:37.165 --> 10:38.998
There is no out.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.300
You know this.

10:44.172 --> 10:46.038
Shut up! Shut up!

10:46.040 --> 10:47.340
I said I'm out.

10:47.342 --> 10:50.443
I've paid my debt off five times over.

10:50.445 --> 10:53.045
I can't do this anymore.
You can't make me.

10:53.047 --> 10:56.048
There... is... no... out.

10:56.050 --> 10:58.117
I s-s...

11:01.456 --> 11:02.955
Your work isn't done.

11:02.957 --> 11:05.358
The cops don't have
any evidence on Serj.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.293
But you need to make
sure it stays that way.

11:07.295 --> 11:10.997
And if anyone gets close to the truth...

11:10.999 --> 11:12.531
you need to take care of them.

11:18.172 --> 11:20.373
I promise it'll be
easier the second time.

11:26.981 --> 11:28.214
Armstrong.

11:28.216 --> 11:29.616
No!

11:31.219 --> 11:33.686
- You think I'm crazy.
- _

11:33.688 --> 11:37.223
No. It's just been a traumatic 24 hours,

11:37.225 --> 11:38.691
and I think you're fried.

11:38.693 --> 11:39.792
It's clear...

11:39.794 --> 11:42.561
she says "Armstrong"
before he steps out.

11:42.563 --> 11:45.264
She was trying to tell
me something about him.

11:45.266 --> 11:47.533
Maybe, but it could have been anything.

11:47.535 --> 11:49.804
I mean, look, we know
that Erin was a dirty cop,

11:49.806 --> 11:51.237
but we have seen nothing to suggest

11:51.239 --> 11:54.006
that she was working with
anyone else on the job.

11:54.008 --> 11:55.408
How did she get into my shop, then?

11:55.410 --> 11:56.509
I locked it.

11:56.511 --> 11:58.277
And as a detective,

11:58.279 --> 12:00.179
Armstrong would have a very easy time

12:00.181 --> 12:02.950
getting his hands on those files
without leaving a paper trail.

12:04.686 --> 12:07.553
So, what, Armstrong murdered
Erin to shut her up?

12:07.555 --> 12:09.422
Do you realize what
you are accusing him of?

12:09.424 --> 12:11.914
Yes, I do. He's my friend...

12:11.916 --> 12:13.939
and a mentor, and this is killing me.

12:13.941 --> 12:15.163
But if I'm right,

12:15.165 --> 12:17.099
he's betraying everything we stand for.

12:21.956 --> 12:23.112
It's not enough.

12:23.114 --> 12:24.803
So we gather more evidence.

12:24.805 --> 12:27.440
Armstrong was with me
nearly all day yesterday.

12:27.442 --> 12:29.375
It was a fast-moving situation,

12:29.377 --> 12:32.578
but he had to have contacted
both Ruben and Erin,

12:32.580 --> 12:34.236
contact that could have
been caught on body cam,

12:34.238 --> 12:36.282
on shop cam or dash cam.

12:36.284 --> 12:39.353
Which you need me
to authorize access to.

12:45.994 --> 12:48.327
Alright.

12:48.329 --> 12:50.596
I'm in.

12:50.598 --> 12:53.332
But don't tell anyone else about this.

12:53.334 --> 12:55.668
If this gets out,
it will ruin Armstrong's life...

12:55.670 --> 12:56.826
and your career.

12:56.828 --> 12:58.450
And if I'm right?

12:58.452 --> 13:01.943
Then it will tear the department apart.

13:03.470 --> 13:06.470
- Synced and corrected by<font color="#00BFFF"> Firefly</font> -
- <font color="#00ffff">www.addic7ed.com</font> -

13:07.884 --> 13:10.716
Thanks for being positive about my move.

13:11.940 --> 13:16.275
Well, you haven't moved until
you get on that flight tonight.

13:16.277 --> 13:19.278
And we still have one last dinner.

13:19.280 --> 13:22.482
You'll come visit, right?

13:22.484 --> 13:26.519
I mean, once Lucy's
Thirty Day Push is over?

13:34.996 --> 13:37.196
Hey. You're here early.

13:37.198 --> 13:38.951
That would imply I left.

13:38.953 --> 13:40.075
Any movement?

13:40.077 --> 13:42.282
There's still no evidence
that puts Serj in that car.

13:42.284 --> 13:44.017
And they checked every traffic
camera on the chase route?

13:44.019 --> 13:45.475
Yeah. All the way to the parking garage

13:45.477 --> 13:46.853
where the Maserati was abandoned.

13:46.855 --> 13:48.221
And without the murder weapon,

13:48.223 --> 13:50.023
I have to put Serj in that
car during the shooting

13:50.025 --> 13:51.665
or he's gonna get away
with killing a cop.

13:55.197 --> 13:56.797
How you holding up?

13:58.033 --> 14:00.166
I watched him die.

14:00.168 --> 14:02.335
It's, um...

14:02.337 --> 14:04.137
It's tearing me up.

14:04.139 --> 14:06.336
I've been where you are.

14:06.338 --> 14:08.471
I'm gonna help you get through it.

14:08.473 --> 14:09.840
Thank you.

14:11.309 --> 14:12.408
Alright.

14:12.410 --> 14:13.843
We're gonna have to recanvass,

14:13.845 --> 14:15.628
starting with the original 911 call.

14:15.630 --> 14:18.026
L.A. is the most self-obsessed
city on the planet.

14:18.028 --> 14:20.650
Someone has a photo that
puts Serj behind the wheel.

14:20.652 --> 14:21.784
Just watch.

14:21.786 --> 14:23.419
Every time there's a break in the case,

14:23.421 --> 14:24.954
Armstrong sends a text.

14:27.559 --> 14:28.602
_

14:31.584 --> 14:34.475
Okay, right here. Outside Ruben's house.

14:34.477 --> 14:36.651
When he crosses past Erin,

14:36.653 --> 14:38.421
you can see him slip her something.

14:38.423 --> 14:40.279
That's a stretch. You
can't see their hands.

14:40.281 --> 14:42.752
True, but after this, inside the house,

14:42.754 --> 14:44.990
Armstrong is checking
his phone during the raid

14:44.992 --> 14:47.769
to see when Erin has got
the gun from my shop,

14:47.771 --> 14:48.836
and I swear to God,

14:48.838 --> 14:50.932
you can see the exact
moment he finds out she did.

14:50.934 --> 14:52.654
Well, this is all still circumstantial.

14:52.656 --> 14:54.722
I mean, Armstrong could
be texting his mother

14:54.724 --> 14:56.057
or his girlfriend.

14:56.059 --> 14:58.153
I'm not saying that I believe that,

14:58.155 --> 15:00.294
but this is still not
enough to take to IA.

15:00.296 --> 15:02.096
What if we can tell what
he was texting and to who?

15:02.098 --> 15:03.931
Could we get a warrant?
Search his phone records?

15:03.933 --> 15:05.299
If Armstrong really is dirty,

15:05.301 --> 15:07.101
do you believe that he is dumb enough

15:07.103 --> 15:09.488
to crime on his own personal cellphone?

15:09.490 --> 15:11.513
No.

15:11.515 --> 15:13.240
I can't get a warrant for a burner

15:13.242 --> 15:14.398
unless we know the number.

15:14.400 --> 15:15.943
So how do we get that number?

15:15.945 --> 15:18.779
Isolate the signal somehow.

15:18.781 --> 15:20.926
Get him out in the middle of nowhere,

15:20.928 --> 15:23.284
where there's only a few active phones,

15:23.286 --> 15:26.954
and then we pull the records
from the nearest cell tower.

15:26.956 --> 15:28.389
So how do we get him out there?

15:28.391 --> 15:29.547
I have an idea.

15:29.549 --> 15:31.125
How did the shooting inquiry go?

15:31.127 --> 15:32.193
Smooth so far.

15:32.195 --> 15:33.990
They said they might reach
out for some follow-up,

15:33.992 --> 15:36.096
but given what's at stake,
they're keeping me active duty.

15:36.098 --> 15:37.231
That's good news.

15:37.233 --> 15:38.833
We need you out there
turning over rocks,

15:38.835 --> 15:40.968
- avenging Officer Rios.
- Yeah.

15:40.970 --> 15:42.803
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes?

15:42.805 --> 15:44.389
I might have a way to run down Serj.

15:44.391 --> 15:45.556
You got my attention.

15:45.558 --> 15:48.126
There's a former contact of
mine from way back in the day.

15:48.128 --> 15:50.294
He runs in the same
circles as Serj and Ruben.

15:50.296 --> 15:51.686
He might talk to me.

15:51.688 --> 15:53.447
Well, run it down.
You don't need my permission.

15:53.449 --> 15:55.906
I do if I want to go
plainclothes and unmarked.

15:55.908 --> 15:57.772
I'll spook him if I show
up in blues and a shop.

15:57.774 --> 15:58.873
Do it.

16:02.302 --> 16:04.136
Good having you back out there, Nick.

16:05.890 --> 16:07.079
Hey!

16:07.081 --> 16:08.970
You, uh, mind if I tag along?

16:08.972 --> 16:10.829
Better than finding my own clues.

16:10.831 --> 16:12.965
Sure. The more, the merrier.

16:12.967 --> 16:14.322
Great. Uh, let me grab my keys.

16:14.324 --> 16:16.024
I'll meet you in the parking lot.

16:16.026 --> 16:18.082
What I'm about to tell
you stays between us.

16:18.084 --> 16:19.106
Okay.

16:19.108 --> 16:20.695
For the last nine months,

16:20.697 --> 16:22.196
Vice has had an active informant

16:22.198 --> 16:25.066
inside Ruben Derian's operation.

16:25.068 --> 16:26.334
Cisco Fane.

16:26.336 --> 16:27.902
Third-generation bottom-feeder.

16:27.904 --> 16:29.237
He's helped generate
three search warrants

16:29.239 --> 16:31.205
netting over $2 million in narcotics.

16:31.207 --> 16:32.473
He could give us Serj.

16:32.475 --> 16:33.808
That's the hope.

16:33.810 --> 16:35.043
But Cisco's been radio silent

16:35.045 --> 16:37.011
since he was sent a request
for a meet yesterday.

16:37.013 --> 16:38.913
And you're worried
he's been compromised?

16:38.915 --> 16:41.083
I'm worried he's been
dumped in a shallow grave.

16:42.548 --> 16:45.005
You think Erin's the only
dirty cop on Derian's payroll?

16:45.007 --> 16:46.421
I think you always plan for the worst,

16:46.423 --> 16:48.857
which is why we're
keeping this op quiet.

16:48.859 --> 16:51.359
Any idea where Cisco
could be? If he's not dead.

16:51.361 --> 16:53.061
Well, the Derians have been muscling in

16:53.063 --> 16:54.495
on the east side sex trade.

16:54.497 --> 16:57.031
They've taken over
SROs, massage parlors,

16:57.033 --> 16:59.000
and a karaoke bar where Cisco works.

16:59.002 --> 17:00.524
I-I still can't believe karaoke bars

17:00.526 --> 17:01.626
are covers for brothels.

17:01.628 --> 17:03.371
Everywhere is a cover for a brothel.

17:03.373 --> 17:05.205
That's depressing.

17:05.208 --> 17:07.031
I should ride with Armstrong.

17:07.032 --> 17:09.109
We need eyes on him at all times.

17:09.112 --> 17:11.378
Alright, but be very
careful what you say.

17:11.381 --> 17:12.603
If you are right about him,

17:12.605 --> 17:14.288
he's basically been operating undercover

17:14.290 --> 17:15.811
inside the police department.

17:15.814 --> 17:18.801
- His radar is gonna be hypersensitive.
- Got it.

17:18.804 --> 17:20.454
- And make him drive.
- Okay.

17:20.457 --> 17:21.521
Why?

17:21.523 --> 17:23.919
Behind the wheel, you're
at a tactical disadvantage.

17:23.921 --> 17:25.207
If anything goes south,

17:25.209 --> 17:27.944
you'll need both hands
to defend yourself.

17:28.865 --> 17:31.065
So, who's your contact?

17:31.067 --> 17:35.103
Just some overachieving
dirtbag I used to hang with.

17:35.105 --> 17:36.204
He got a name?

17:36.206 --> 17:37.872
Yep.

17:37.874 --> 17:40.475
Ah, okay. Okay.

17:40.477 --> 17:43.111
I'm piggybacking on your play. I get it.

17:43.113 --> 17:45.279
You at least gonna tell me where
we're meeting Mr. Nameless?

17:45.281 --> 17:47.382
Uh, Baldwin Hills.

17:47.384 --> 17:48.449
Cool if I ride with you?

17:48.451 --> 17:49.550
Sure thing.

17:49.552 --> 17:50.985
You mind driving, though?

17:50.987 --> 17:52.421
I didn't get much sleep last night.

17:54.057 --> 17:56.090
- Sure.
- Great.

18:00.873 --> 18:02.535
This is where the
high-speed chase began.

18:02.537 --> 18:05.730
9:15 yesterday morning, a local
calls in shots fired to 911.

18:05.732 --> 18:06.934
Based on Erin's confession,

18:06.936 --> 18:09.277
we know that she was meeting
Serj here to pass along intel.

18:09.279 --> 18:11.512
Things got heated, and they
started firing at each other.

18:11.514 --> 18:13.714
Chris and his T.O. arrive on
the scene two minutes later,

18:13.716 --> 18:15.850
in time to see the Maserati
haul ass out of here.

18:15.852 --> 18:19.554
Eight minutes later,
Chris is fatally wounded.

18:19.556 --> 18:21.589
You sure you're up for this?

18:21.591 --> 18:23.981
- You could still take the day, if you need it.
- No way.

18:23.983 --> 18:26.514
I want to see this guy in
handcuffs just as badly as you.

18:26.516 --> 18:27.871
On the bright side, it sure does

18:27.873 --> 18:29.496
put my wedding drama in perspective.

18:29.498 --> 18:30.687
Does that mean you're letting

18:30.689 --> 18:31.978
the two moms plan the festivities?

18:31.980 --> 18:34.349
Hell no. But I will work a little harder

18:34.351 --> 18:35.473
to listen to their advice.

18:35.475 --> 18:36.731
Uh, excuse me, sir?

18:36.733 --> 18:38.189
Were you here yesterday morning?

18:38.191 --> 18:39.313
No, they chased me out.

18:39.315 --> 18:41.100
- Who chased you out?
- The bride and groom.

18:41.102 --> 18:42.777
- What were they doing?
- Who?

18:42.779 --> 18:44.470
- The bride and groom.
- Posing.

18:44.472 --> 18:46.272
For what? Photos?

18:46.274 --> 18:49.064
Wait, why would someone
take wedding pictures here?

18:49.066 --> 18:51.510
Who cares why? Were they
taking pictures of themselves?

18:51.512 --> 18:53.279
No, they had an angry camera lady.

18:53.281 --> 18:54.881
She's the one that chased me away.

18:58.853 --> 19:00.753
- That's something.
- Yeah.

19:10.198 --> 19:11.797
Do you know who Harper's contact is?

19:11.799 --> 19:13.265
To be honest, no.

19:13.267 --> 19:15.668
She's always been very
protective of her sources.

19:15.670 --> 19:16.936
Smart.

19:16.938 --> 19:19.638
Gotta keep sensitive
information need-to-know.

19:19.640 --> 19:21.373
Officer Cole proved that.

19:21.375 --> 19:23.375
How you coping after the shooting?

19:23.377 --> 19:25.511
Yeah, it's been rough.

19:25.513 --> 19:27.379
I keep replaying it over
and over in my head,

19:27.381 --> 19:29.515
wondering what I could
have done different.

19:29.517 --> 19:32.351
She pointed her gun at you.
You had to take the shot.

19:32.353 --> 19:35.621
Yeah, but you said you thought
you were getting through to her.

19:35.623 --> 19:37.223
If I just hadn't
surprised her like that,

19:37.225 --> 19:39.291
who knows what would have happened?

19:39.293 --> 19:40.893
She might have flipped.

19:40.895 --> 19:44.230
Given us Serj and Ruben.

19:44.232 --> 19:46.367
And anyone else in the
department who might be dirty.

19:46.369 --> 19:48.734
You think there's another
rat in the department?

19:48.736 --> 19:50.503
God, I hope not.

19:57.339 --> 19:59.061
It's Rachel's last night.

19:59.063 --> 20:00.519
You doing anything special?

20:00.521 --> 20:03.549
Dinner, take her to the airport.

20:03.551 --> 20:04.984
Wow.

20:04.986 --> 20:07.133
You always said it would
be a cold day in Hell

20:07.135 --> 20:08.822
before you drove anyone to LAX.

20:09.724 --> 20:13.859
So... are you really gonna
visit Rachel in New York?

20:13.861 --> 20:15.895
No.

20:15.897 --> 20:18.697
I'm gonna rip the Band-Aid
off at dinner tonight.

20:18.699 --> 20:20.566
Long distance never works.

20:20.568 --> 20:21.600
You don't know that.

20:21.602 --> 20:23.869
Yeah. I do.

20:23.871 --> 20:25.704
I'm really gonna miss her.

20:25.706 --> 20:27.540
Me too.

20:27.542 --> 20:29.742
So, what's the plan?

20:29.744 --> 20:31.744
We're gonna go practice our ABCs.

20:31.746 --> 20:33.879
What if we find Cisco?

20:33.881 --> 20:35.681
- Improvise.
- Thank you.

20:35.683 --> 20:37.516
Why does God hate me?

20:37.518 --> 20:38.617
Good morning.

20:38.619 --> 20:39.872
We're here conducting

20:39.874 --> 20:41.954
an Alcohol Beverage
Control compliance check.

20:41.956 --> 20:44.290
Kiss my ass. We don't serve minors here.

20:44.292 --> 20:46.454
I follow the laws, even the dumb ones.

20:46.456 --> 20:47.511
Convincing argument,

20:47.513 --> 20:49.428
yet we're gonna need to
put eyes on everyone here.

20:49.430 --> 20:50.719
It's the Police Department.

20:50.721 --> 20:52.932
I need everyone to step
out into the hall now.

20:52.934 --> 20:54.934
- Come on.
- Let's go. Come out.

20:54.936 --> 20:56.869
IDs out.

20:57.905 --> 20:59.905
Step outside.

20:59.907 --> 21:01.575
- Let's go.
- Tim.

21:03.945 --> 21:05.978
Don't you shoot up my club.

21:05.980 --> 21:07.980
I just had it painted.

21:07.982 --> 21:09.749
Get everyone back.

21:10.980 --> 21:12.336
This is the police.

21:12.338 --> 21:14.720
Need you to step out into the hall now.

21:14.722 --> 21:16.989
Aw. Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa.

21:16.991 --> 21:18.390
What's going on?

21:18.392 --> 21:19.658
What the hell'd you say to me?

21:19.660 --> 21:20.926
- What?
- Get up against the wall.

21:20.928 --> 21:22.795
Put your hand up.

21:22.797 --> 21:23.963
What?

21:23.965 --> 21:26.432
LAPD's been looking for you.

21:26.434 --> 21:28.801
Look, after the shooting,
Ruben locked everything down,

21:28.803 --> 21:30.502
made everyone give up their phones.

21:30.504 --> 21:31.770
Here's a new one.

21:31.772 --> 21:34.406
I need you to find out
where Serj is and text me.

21:34.408 --> 21:36.475
They'll cut me into
pieces if they catch me.

21:36.477 --> 21:38.344
Tough, alright?

21:38.346 --> 21:41.480
You do it, or I violate
you and send you to Lompoc.

21:41.482 --> 21:43.416
- You got that?
- Yeah.

21:44.352 --> 21:46.352
He's clean.

21:46.354 --> 21:47.854
Watch your attitude next time.

21:48.956 --> 21:50.623
I told you, we don't serve minors.

21:50.625 --> 21:51.790
Yeah, you did.

21:51.792 --> 21:53.592
But I noticed a half-dozen
other infractions.

21:53.594 --> 21:55.595
I'd get those fixed
before Code Enforcement

21:55.597 --> 21:56.663
shows up in the morning.

21:57.665 --> 21:59.365
Have a nice day.

21:59.367 --> 22:01.600
I checked every event space
within a mile of the warehouse.

22:01.602 --> 22:03.202
None of them had weddings yesterday.

22:03.204 --> 22:04.670
Where'd this bride and groom come from?

22:04.672 --> 22:06.538
No idea. And without
a venue to question,

22:06.540 --> 22:08.766
we're left calling up every
photographer in Los Angeles.

22:08.768 --> 22:11.010
Well, social media to the rescue.

22:11.012 --> 22:13.479
#Wedding.

22:13.481 --> 22:14.980
That's a lot.

22:14.982 --> 22:17.116
Try #WreckTheDress.

22:17.118 --> 22:19.111
- Okay.
- It's the new thing.

22:19.113 --> 22:20.719
Destroy your dress after the wedding.

22:20.721 --> 22:22.488
Wait, don't dresses cost a fortune?

22:22.490 --> 22:23.856
Why in the hell would people do that?

22:23.858 --> 22:25.592
To spite their mother-in-laws.

22:27.962 --> 22:29.628
- Wait.
- Whoa.

22:29.630 --> 22:31.030
That's the Maserati.

22:31.032 --> 22:32.865
We gotta get that photographer in here.

22:41.742 --> 22:43.742
Stay here. I won't be long.

22:43.744 --> 22:45.676
Excuse me. With all due respect,

22:45.678 --> 22:46.891
we should be in there with you,

22:46.893 --> 22:48.360
in case things go sideways.

22:48.362 --> 22:49.915
Negative. My guy is skittish.

22:49.917 --> 22:51.484
If I need you, I will signal.

22:54.755 --> 22:57.189
She go rogue like this all the time?

22:57.191 --> 22:58.691
Not all the time.

22:58.693 --> 23:00.759
Why are you so worried?

23:00.761 --> 23:02.594
I'm not.

23:02.596 --> 23:04.063
I just want to do this by the book.

23:04.065 --> 23:06.532
The last thing we need
is another officer down.

23:07.735 --> 23:09.068
Ah. That's Henry.

23:09.070 --> 23:10.436
Do you mind if I take this?

23:10.438 --> 23:11.937
Yeah, yeah.

23:11.939 --> 23:13.572
Hey.

23:13.574 --> 23:14.673
How's he doing?

23:14.675 --> 23:16.075
Uh, definitely anxious.

23:16.077 --> 23:17.943
- He text anyone?
- No, not yet.

23:17.945 --> 23:20.157
Alright. I'll stay inside
another 10 minutes,

23:20.159 --> 23:21.680
make him sweat.

23:21.682 --> 23:23.683
_

23:27.404 --> 23:28.560
Hey, Grace.

23:28.562 --> 23:30.422
Hey. You answered.

23:30.424 --> 23:32.591
Yeah. Sorry. A lot's been going on.

23:32.593 --> 23:34.460
I know. I...

23:34.462 --> 23:35.761
I wasn't thinking.

23:35.763 --> 23:38.430
I just, um...

23:38.432 --> 23:39.732
We need to talk.

23:39.734 --> 23:40.933
I gotta go.

23:46.707 --> 23:48.974
Wha... You... You were
supposed to stay outside.

23:48.976 --> 23:50.109
Where's your guy?

23:50.111 --> 23:51.478
He went out back.

23:52.613 --> 23:54.780
- Everything okay?
- Yeah. Thought I heard something.

23:54.782 --> 23:56.081
Did your guy give up Serj?

23:56.083 --> 23:58.784
No. Man, he was... he
was just playing me.

23:58.786 --> 24:00.786
He... He just wanted reward money.

24:00.788 --> 24:03.222
That's aggravating.

24:03.224 --> 24:05.924
But that's the job, right?

24:05.926 --> 24:09.094
90% failure, 5% victory.

24:09.096 --> 24:10.662
What's the other 5%?

24:10.664 --> 24:12.097
Fear.

24:12.099 --> 24:14.767
You mind driving back
with Detective Harper?

24:14.769 --> 24:16.568
I've intruded on your time long enough.

24:16.570 --> 24:17.970
- You got it.
- Alright.

24:17.972 --> 24:20.073
See you later.

24:23.778 --> 24:25.844
You think he knows?

24:25.846 --> 24:27.112
I think we better pray

24:27.114 --> 24:29.549
bringing him out here
was worth the risk.

24:35.156 --> 24:37.956
Alright, I got the cell records
from the nearest tower.

24:37.958 --> 24:39.658
Four cellphones were pinged

24:39.660 --> 24:41.178
during the 15 minutes we've been here.

24:41.180 --> 24:44.196
Mine, yours,
Armstrong's official cell...

24:44.198 --> 24:46.999
hmm... and this.

24:47.001 --> 24:49.034
His burner. We got it.

24:49.036 --> 24:52.004
Can you pull up his
call and text records?

24:52.006 --> 24:54.006
- Damn it.
- What?

24:54.008 --> 24:56.141
That number was first
activated this morning.

24:56.143 --> 24:58.010
He hasn't made a single call or text.

24:58.012 --> 24:59.711
He's using a fresh burner phone today?

24:59.713 --> 25:00.813
That is smart.

25:00.815 --> 25:02.681
Cops make the best criminals.

25:02.683 --> 25:03.982
We got to be smarter.

25:03.984 --> 25:05.117
We got to trip him up somehow.

25:05.119 --> 25:06.786
We got to get into his head.

25:09.918 --> 25:10.956
What?

25:19.700 --> 25:21.634
Told you you'd be back.

25:24.069 --> 25:25.902
You told me not to trust Armstrong.

25:27.444 --> 25:29.411
Oh, John.

25:29.413 --> 25:31.913
I get so few visitors.

25:31.915 --> 25:33.715
Let's catch up first.

25:33.717 --> 25:35.085
There's no time.

25:35.087 --> 25:36.420
Maybe for you.

25:36.422 --> 25:38.188
I've got nothing but time.

25:38.190 --> 25:40.123
So, are you seeing anyone?

25:40.125 --> 25:41.225
We're not talking about that.

25:41.227 --> 25:42.726
Protective.

25:42.728 --> 25:44.662
Which means that you are.

25:44.664 --> 25:47.164
Okay, fine. Yes, I'm seeing someone.

25:47.166 --> 25:50.167
She's an amateur astronomer
and professional luge polisher.

25:50.169 --> 25:51.268
We met at a Lizzo concert.

25:51.270 --> 25:53.570
We're gonna raise ocelots
together. It's very exciting.

25:53.572 --> 25:55.539
Now, let's get back to Armstrong.

25:55.541 --> 25:57.675
- You're no fun at all.
- Two cops are dead,

25:57.677 --> 25:59.843
and the guy I thought was
my friend is responsible.

25:59.845 --> 26:01.101
Now help me...

26:01.103 --> 26:02.225
Kill him?

26:02.227 --> 26:03.383
Catch him.

26:03.385 --> 26:06.417
Mm. Less interesting.

26:06.419 --> 26:08.419
And help will cost you.

26:08.421 --> 26:10.287
Cost me what?

26:10.289 --> 26:12.856
The truth. About that girlfriend.

26:12.858 --> 26:14.693
- Forget it.
- Okay.

26:20.566 --> 26:23.867
She's thinking about
going back to her husband.

26:23.869 --> 26:26.204
She's been trying to call me all day.

26:28.574 --> 26:30.441
Well, call her back.

26:30.443 --> 26:31.643
Right now.

26:41.654 --> 26:43.754
Hey.

26:45.791 --> 26:47.291
You've been trying to call me

26:47.293 --> 26:49.360
to tell me you're getting
back together with Simon.

26:50.730 --> 26:51.929
I'm sorry.

26:51.931 --> 26:53.664
Do you love him?

26:53.666 --> 26:55.466
No.

26:55.468 --> 26:57.468
But I have to do this for Oliver.

26:57.470 --> 26:59.245
I know you think you do,

26:59.247 --> 27:00.938
- but you're wrong.
- John...

27:00.940 --> 27:03.507
I've been going back and
forth in my head for days.

27:03.509 --> 27:06.410
Do I give you your space
or do I tell you how I feel?

27:06.412 --> 27:08.315
I know how much you love your son.

27:08.317 --> 27:11.041
I know you'd do anything
to make him happy.

27:11.043 --> 27:12.510
But I've been down this road.

27:14.081 --> 27:17.105
I've stayed together for
the kid, and it's a mistake.

27:17.107 --> 27:18.696
Please don't.

27:18.698 --> 27:21.400
I mean, this is so hard for me to do.

27:22.567 --> 27:24.035
Grace, I love you.

27:26.389 --> 27:29.257
That has to matter.

27:31.804 --> 27:32.936
I have to go.

27:32.938 --> 27:35.272
- Grace...
- I'm sorry.

27:41.347 --> 27:42.513
How are you feeling?

27:42.515 --> 27:44.783
Don't push it, Rosalind.

27:47.686 --> 27:49.686
Now tell me what you
know about Armstrong.

27:51.457 --> 27:53.390
Before my arrest, he broke into my house

27:53.392 --> 27:54.525
without a warrant.

27:54.527 --> 27:55.959
Yeah, he told me about that.

27:55.961 --> 27:58.862
Well, I broke into his.

27:58.864 --> 28:00.831
Afterwards.

28:00.833 --> 28:02.966
And you found something.

28:02.968 --> 28:06.236
A hidden compartment in
the laundry room wall...

28:06.238 --> 28:08.972
filled with all kinds of goodies.

28:08.974 --> 28:10.374
Like what?

28:10.376 --> 28:13.977
Money. Guns. Evidence.

28:13.979 --> 28:17.014
The sort of thing a crooked
cop keeps for insurance.

28:17.016 --> 28:20.079
Sadly, nothing I could use
to keep me out of prison.

28:20.081 --> 28:22.415
Unfortunately for you...

28:22.417 --> 28:24.707
they're not gonna take
the word of a serial killer

28:24.709 --> 28:26.552
- to give you a search warrant.
- No, they're not.

28:26.554 --> 28:29.156
I'm gonna have to do
what you did... break in.

28:30.258 --> 28:31.791
Hope that I can find something

28:31.793 --> 28:33.593
that will lead me to
evidence I can actually use.

28:33.595 --> 28:36.128
I don't think your T.O.
is gonna approve of that.

28:36.130 --> 28:37.397
You'd be surprised.

28:37.399 --> 28:39.399
But this is a one-man operation.

28:39.401 --> 28:41.401
I owe Harper too much to
put her career in jeopardy.

28:41.403 --> 28:43.403
So noble.

28:43.405 --> 28:45.838
I give you 6-to-1 odds against, though.

28:45.840 --> 28:47.240
Odds of what?

28:47.242 --> 28:49.409
Surviving.

28:49.411 --> 28:51.844
Armstrong is much
smarter than you, John.

28:51.846 --> 28:54.615
Twice as ruthless. Hell, he caught me.

28:55.850 --> 28:59.218
So, if this is the last time I see you,

28:59.220 --> 29:01.421
you will live on in my fantasies.

29:01.423 --> 29:03.423
Well, that makes one of us.

31:15.690 --> 31:17.658
I told you I'd keep you posted.

31:19.727 --> 31:22.663
I'm taking care of it.
You don't have to know how.

31:29.537 --> 31:30.971
I gotta go.

32:04.472 --> 32:06.572
- Hey.
- Are you still at the prison?

32:06.574 --> 32:07.673
I'm on my way back.

32:07.675 --> 32:09.108
Rosalind give you anything useful?

32:09.110 --> 32:10.209
Nah. It was a dead end.

32:10.211 --> 32:12.868
Uh, I think it's time to
bring Grey into the loop.

32:12.870 --> 32:13.879
How far away are you?

32:13.881 --> 32:18.918
20 minutes.

32:27.476 --> 32:29.184
Rachel.

32:29.186 --> 32:31.453
Hi. I'm at the front desk.

32:31.455 --> 32:33.522
- Where are you?
- Oh.

32:33.524 --> 32:36.858
I am... I'm sorry.
The day just got away from me.

32:36.860 --> 32:38.427
I can be back in 20 minutes.

32:38.429 --> 32:40.529
Uh, Tim. It's Cisco.

32:40.531 --> 32:41.964
He got a location on Serj.

32:41.966 --> 32:43.432
- Rach...
- I heard.

32:43.434 --> 32:44.933
Go get him.

32:44.935 --> 32:46.201
I am so sorry.

32:46.203 --> 32:50.172
It's okay. I-I understand.

32:50.174 --> 32:52.941
Guess I'll, uh, call you when I land.

32:52.943 --> 32:54.176
- In New York.
- Yeah.

32:54.178 --> 32:55.711
Uh, please do that, okay?

32:55.713 --> 32:57.346
And again, I'm... I'm sorry.

33:01.152 --> 33:02.885
Better this way.

33:13.259 --> 33:14.526
Wait, go back.

33:20.504 --> 33:22.272
We got him. Thank you.

33:25.543 --> 33:27.076
Sir, we found photos that put Serj

33:27.078 --> 33:28.477
in the Maserati during the pursuit.

33:28.479 --> 33:29.680
Great job. Gear up.

33:29.682 --> 33:32.373
We just got a location.
SWAT's mobilizing.

33:32.375 --> 33:34.521
Harper, grab Nolan, get
ready for a tactical assault.

33:34.523 --> 33:37.160
- Wheels up in two minutes.
- Sir, Nolan is currently unavailable,

33:37.162 --> 33:38.887
- but if I could talk to you in private for a second...
- No time.

33:38.889 --> 33:40.222
We got a cop killer to catch.

33:45.396 --> 33:48.063
All available units respond
to the command post

33:48.065 --> 33:49.364
at Wilshire and Devonshire.

33:49.366 --> 33:52.239
Special operations has
located suspect Serj Derian

33:52.241 --> 33:53.702
and is requesting marked units

33:53.704 --> 33:55.345
for additional perimeter
and traffic control.

33:55.347 --> 33:57.906
Attach over the box and
respond to the command post.

33:57.908 --> 33:59.608
_

34:02.012 --> 34:03.345
What?

34:03.347 --> 34:04.627
They know where you are.

34:04.629 --> 34:06.497
You gotta get out of there. Now.

34:07.718 --> 34:10.252
You screwed me. You're a dead man.

34:12.556 --> 34:14.188
Go!

34:20.384 --> 34:23.532
Stop! Get your hands
in the air! Drop the gun!

34:25.034 --> 34:27.268
Turn around! Get down on your knees!

34:27.271 --> 34:29.138
One down! Two steps back!

34:29.139 --> 34:30.205
On your knees!

34:30.206 --> 34:31.572
Don't move.

34:34.210 --> 34:36.145
- Police! Don't move!
- Drop the gun!

34:40.951 --> 34:43.284
You're under arrest for
the murder of Chris Rios.

34:46.389 --> 34:48.757
Okay. Which terminal?

34:48.759 --> 34:50.292
Uh, four.

34:50.293 --> 34:52.226
Thanks.

34:53.563 --> 34:55.197
Now what?

34:56.333 --> 34:59.768
Passenger, please exit the vehicle.

35:08.179 --> 35:10.612
I... I'm sorry I missed dinner.

35:10.614 --> 35:12.614
It's okay.

35:12.616 --> 35:15.017
I probably would have
spent the entire time

35:15.019 --> 35:16.351
thinking about the end.

35:18.422 --> 35:21.423
Is this the end?

35:21.425 --> 35:22.524
Yeah.

35:25.196 --> 35:26.695
I d... I don't know.

35:26.697 --> 35:31.166
I... I spent the day
planning to say goodbye...

35:31.168 --> 35:33.302
Yet, here you are.

35:33.304 --> 35:36.338
And yet, here I am.

35:36.340 --> 35:40.542
Look, Rach, I don't know
what happens next...

35:40.544 --> 35:42.544
but I think we should find out.

35:56.360 --> 36:00.360
_

36:01.799 --> 36:02.998
Nick?

36:03.000 --> 36:04.132
It's over, John.

36:04.134 --> 36:05.834
- What is?
- All of it.

36:05.836 --> 36:07.369
They caught Serj,

36:07.371 --> 36:09.371
and I'm dead if I don't make a deal.

36:09.373 --> 36:11.540
- Why did you do it?
- Not like this.

36:11.542 --> 36:14.810
I owe you the truth, but face to face.

36:14.812 --> 36:17.045
I'll be sitting in my living room.

36:17.047 --> 36:19.348
The back door's still open
from when you broke in.

36:21.385 --> 36:23.618
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

36:26.967 --> 36:28.534
Right here, John.

36:33.874 --> 36:35.407
Don't do anything stupid.

36:35.409 --> 36:37.276
Little late for that. Where's Harper?

36:37.278 --> 36:38.711
She's not along for this ride.

36:38.713 --> 36:40.212
Get on your knees,
hands behind your head.

36:40.214 --> 36:41.714
Sure, sure.

36:41.716 --> 36:43.582
I got some things I want
to get off my chest.

36:43.584 --> 36:44.717
Save it for IA.

36:44.719 --> 36:46.585
Well, it's not for IA. It's for you.

36:46.587 --> 36:48.454
Look, I can't make
this right. I know that.

36:48.456 --> 36:50.656
But I have to at least try
to make you understand.

36:50.658 --> 36:52.225
You don't think I understand?

36:53.130 --> 36:55.068
You sold us out,
and you murdered Erin Cole.

36:55.070 --> 36:56.704
She pointed a gun at me.

36:57.746 --> 37:00.566
Look, I-I-I didn't want that to happen.

37:00.568 --> 37:03.016
I got caught up in a rip
current five years ago

37:03.018 --> 37:04.918
that I can't get out of.

37:04.920 --> 37:05.985
When Rebecca died,

37:05.987 --> 37:08.488
I was a quarter million
dollars in the hole.

37:08.490 --> 37:10.089
Insurance covered a fraction

37:10.091 --> 37:11.991
of what it cost to take care of her.

37:11.993 --> 37:14.360
I had debt collectors calling me up

37:14.362 --> 37:16.396
when I was out in the
street chasing criminals,

37:16.398 --> 37:19.065
holding grieving victims in my arms.

37:19.067 --> 37:20.631
And that makes everything you did okay?

37:20.633 --> 37:22.569
- Of course not, but...
- No.

37:22.571 --> 37:26.072
You once told me not
to let you off the hook.

37:26.074 --> 37:29.509
"Confessed" to me that
Rosalind Dyer's case

37:29.511 --> 37:32.078
stopped you from being there
for your wife when she was dying.

37:32.080 --> 37:34.547
Now I know that was a lie,
a lie you told yourself

37:34.549 --> 37:36.416
because the truth was too painful.

37:36.418 --> 37:39.085
- What's the truth?
- You're a coward.

37:39.087 --> 37:40.954
You weren't there for Rebecca

37:40.956 --> 37:43.623
because you were too
weak to watch her suffer,

37:43.625 --> 37:46.593
so you blamed the job, same
way you blame your debts

37:46.595 --> 37:49.229
for becoming a criminal and a murderer.

37:49.231 --> 37:51.845
It doesn't matter that you fell down.

37:51.847 --> 37:54.204
Everybody falls down.

37:54.206 --> 37:57.297
What matters is what comes next.

37:57.299 --> 37:59.589
Do you make it right, or
do you just make it worse?

38:01.870 --> 38:03.302
You know your problem, John?

38:09.477 --> 38:11.644
You think you're better than people.

38:11.646 --> 38:13.212
No. Just you.

38:13.214 --> 38:14.928
Now get on the floor, arms out.

38:14.930 --> 38:16.363
Here's the thing.

38:18.353 --> 38:20.353
I-I knew you were
onto me this morning...

38:20.355 --> 38:22.188
that whole wild goose chase.

38:22.190 --> 38:23.956
So...

38:23.958 --> 38:26.159
I spent the day preparing for the worst.

38:26.161 --> 38:27.627
Last time I ask.

38:27.629 --> 38:29.028
Get on the damn ground.

38:29.030 --> 38:30.396
You were friends with Erin.

38:30.398 --> 38:32.499
Hell, I found video of the two of you

38:32.501 --> 38:34.901
conspiring outside a
bar the other night.

38:34.903 --> 38:38.037
Turns out, Serj recruited
you the same time as Erin,

38:38.039 --> 38:42.508
paid you serious money to
funnel police files to him.

38:42.510 --> 38:45.211
- No one's gonna believe that.
- Yeah, they will.

38:45.213 --> 38:46.980
'Cause I won't be the
only one saying it.

38:47.882 --> 38:50.317
There's another cop on the payroll.

38:52.020 --> 38:53.186
John Nolan.

38:56.658 --> 38:58.424
Which bring us to this moment.

38:58.426 --> 39:01.060
You broke into my house to kill me

39:01.062 --> 39:03.229
because I found out you were dirty.

39:03.231 --> 39:06.065
But I killed you in self-defense.

39:08.236 --> 39:09.702
Aah!

39:09.704 --> 39:11.704
Oh!

39:14.676 --> 39:16.042
Aah!

39:16.044 --> 39:18.177
Ohh!

39:19.247 --> 39:20.346
Ahh.

39:24.519 --> 39:25.551
Ahh.

39:25.553 --> 39:27.954
Ohh!

39:27.956 --> 39:29.689
I wouldn't do that.

39:29.691 --> 39:31.257
Control, this is Officer Nolan.

39:31.259 --> 39:33.025
You don't have time for that, John.

39:33.027 --> 39:35.595
You got to go, or they're gonna find it.

39:35.597 --> 39:37.096
Find what?

39:37.098 --> 39:40.266
The evidence in your house.

39:46.274 --> 39:48.274
Hurry, John!
