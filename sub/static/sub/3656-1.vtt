00:27.394 --> 00:28.794
<i>Act three finale.</i>

00:28.796 --> 00:30.496
<i>FBI, kills bigfoot.</i>

00:30.498 --> 00:32.097
Action!
<i>Get on the ground.</i>

00:32.098 --> 00:33.198
I'm not bigfoot.
Get down.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.566
I'm not bigfoot. Don't shoot.

00:34.568 --> 00:36.135
Get down.

00:36.137 --> 00:38.203
Wait a minute, where the hell
is the creature?

01:30.190 --> 01:31.490
Oh, boy.

01:34.195 --> 01:35.327
What the hell.

01:37.697 --> 01:39.531
Hey, there, buddy?

01:39.533 --> 01:40.666
Looks like I caught
you in the middle

01:40.668 --> 01:42.234
of your morning bath.

01:43.537 --> 01:45.370
Well, what the... no, no,
that's all right.

01:45.372 --> 01:47.172
I'll just head further
downstream.

01:47.174 --> 01:49.308
What the fuck!

01:49.310 --> 01:50.509
Run.

01:51.846 --> 01:54.613
Help! Help!

01:56.717 --> 01:58.417
Help!

01:58.419 --> 02:00.252
Bigfoot's after me!

02:00.254 --> 02:01.253
Help!

02:10.729 --> 02:14.399
Bigfoot! Run!

02:14.401 --> 02:15.400
Hey, man.

02:15.402 --> 02:16.401
I'm tying a knot here.

02:16.403 --> 02:17.402
Dude, we got to run.

02:17.404 --> 02:18.537
Bigfoot's coming.

02:18.539 --> 02:20.272
Actually, you've got to run.

02:20.274 --> 02:21.507
I'm first nations.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.275
I've got no beef
with hairy man.

02:23.277 --> 02:24.276
What?

02:25.412 --> 02:26.578
Get out of here, man.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.213
Help!

02:28.215 --> 02:30.249
Bigfoot's after me!

02:37.423 --> 02:39.224
Son of a bitch, that hurts.

02:39.226 --> 02:40.526
That was a good one.

02:40.528 --> 02:43.762
Yeah, we really got
him good, bro.

02:43.764 --> 02:47.466
One less weekend warrior
in our trout waters.

02:47.468 --> 02:50.502
Man, is this suit
getting tired.

02:50.504 --> 02:51.837
Yeah, I caught it on a stick.

02:51.839 --> 02:52.905
I almost ripped
the whole damn thing off

02:52.907 --> 02:54.506
along with my ball sack.

02:54.508 --> 02:55.541
I think we're going to need

02:55.543 --> 02:56.675
to get a new one.

02:56.677 --> 02:57.776
No, we can probably fix it up

02:57.778 --> 02:59.278
a few more times.

02:59.280 --> 03:03.415
Man, that guy fuckin' lost it.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.284
It's pretty awesome.

03:05.286 --> 03:06.318
And that last line of yours,

03:06.320 --> 03:07.753
"you're trespassing,"

03:07.755 --> 03:09.454
that is hysterical, man.

03:09.456 --> 03:10.656
Yes.

03:10.658 --> 03:12.824
You're a quarter white,
man, lighten up.

03:15.428 --> 03:16.628
There's not gonna be any fish

03:16.630 --> 03:18.564
for the next few hundred
yards, at least.

03:18.566 --> 03:19.898
Yeah, but I got him
way before the meat hole,

03:19.900 --> 03:21.266
so we're good from there up.

03:21.268 --> 03:22.634
Cool, because grandma wants me

03:22.636 --> 03:24.369
to bring home a bunch of fish.

03:24.371 --> 03:26.905
What, no catch
and release, Mr. purist?

03:26.907 --> 03:27.906
Not today.

03:27.908 --> 03:28.941
Not today.

03:32.912 --> 03:34.613
David?

03:36.916 --> 03:39.551
David.

03:39.553 --> 03:40.586
Are you here?

03:54.434 --> 03:55.767
David?

04:16.456 --> 04:20.959
I hope he remembers to bring
fish back for our guest.

04:37.644 --> 04:39.311
Oh, shit.

04:39.313 --> 04:41.546
Don't look at 'em.

04:41.548 --> 04:42.581
Well, that's him.

04:42.583 --> 04:44.483
That's the kid.

04:44.485 --> 04:45.651
Tell him about bigfoot.

04:45.653 --> 04:46.885
Hey, art, what's up?

04:46.887 --> 04:48.720
Now, tell him about bigfoot.

04:48.722 --> 04:49.921
I'm sorry, sir.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.023
We just saw a crazy guy

04:51.025 --> 04:52.457
running down the stream.

04:52.459 --> 04:53.692
You looked pretty crazy.
Yeah.

04:53.694 --> 04:55.460
Who the hell are you?

04:55.462 --> 04:56.762
Steve jobs.

04:56.764 --> 04:57.829
Oh, come on, kid.

04:57.831 --> 04:59.031
The creature chased me

04:59.033 --> 05:00.499
from half a mile
down the river.

05:00.501 --> 05:04.336
What'd you call him, hairy man?

05:04.338 --> 05:05.437
Whoa, man.

05:05.439 --> 05:06.772
That's enough.
Tell him!

05:06.774 --> 05:08.440
What do you say
we release David?

05:08.442 --> 05:09.741
No!
What do you say we go down

05:09.743 --> 05:11.310
to the station...
I'm the president

05:11.312 --> 05:12.944
of first freaking bank,
for Christ's sake.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.846
And If you give us a full
report, I'll...

05:14.848 --> 05:16.882
Tell him
what you saw out there.

05:16.884 --> 05:18.450
I'm sorry.
We just saw a crazy guy

05:18.452 --> 05:21.320
messing up our fishing.
Let him go.

05:21.322 --> 05:23.455
All right,
probably seen a bear.

05:23.457 --> 05:24.623
It wasn't a bear.

05:24.625 --> 05:26.058
Okay. It wasn't a bear.

05:26.060 --> 05:28.927
You two, take off,
and I'll go find bigfoot.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.062
Hairy man!

05:30.064 --> 05:31.563
Hairy man.

05:31.565 --> 05:33.765
I'll get you some
dry clothes, some food,

05:33.767 --> 05:37.469
and maybe a sedative.

06:04.831 --> 06:05.964
Whoa!

06:31.691 --> 06:33.458
Hey, Sarah,
what are you doing tonight?

06:33.460 --> 06:34.693
Nothing with you.

06:34.695 --> 06:36.128
Hi, David.

06:37.530 --> 06:38.630
Sarah.

06:38.632 --> 06:40.632
Bitch!
Dude.

06:40.634 --> 06:42.167
She's like the last
single girl in town.

06:42.169 --> 06:43.468
That's because she's a bitch.

06:43.470 --> 06:45.137
That's because you're an idiot.

06:47.707 --> 06:49.674
God, it was such
a good day today, bro.

06:49.676 --> 06:51.042
We scared the hell
out of that tourist.

06:51.044 --> 06:52.043
Uh-hmm.

06:55.882 --> 06:58.583
It's just like
I was never gone.

07:00.820 --> 07:02.654
What?

07:02.656 --> 07:04.856
It's cool to scare
a couple of tourists,

07:04.858 --> 07:06.124
but neither one
of us can afford

07:06.126 --> 07:07.592
to get arrested, again.

07:07.594 --> 07:09.428
Relax, man.
Nobody knows It's us.

07:09.430 --> 07:12.063
We're not going to get caught.

07:12.065 --> 07:14.433
Rodney, you should
know better than anybody,

07:14.435 --> 07:17.202
there are no secrets
in this town.

07:17.204 --> 07:20.906
Look who's talking, slut.

07:20.908 --> 07:23.041
How's fishing today?

07:23.043 --> 07:24.209
Pretty good.

07:24.211 --> 07:26.478
Okay. Rodney,
I have five first timers

07:26.480 --> 07:27.779
thrashing on the river today,

07:27.781 --> 07:30.215
and I know I still got
more fish than you did.

07:30.217 --> 07:32.751
Bullshit.

07:32.753 --> 07:35.754
You know, geniuses,
it is fire season.

07:35.756 --> 07:36.888
David, why do you
hang out with this punk?

07:36.890 --> 07:38.089
He just makes you stupid.

07:38.091 --> 07:39.591
I'll beat you stupid, rc.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.760
Sit down, Rodney.
I'm just fucking with you.

07:41.762 --> 07:43.695
Here. What is this?

07:44.931 --> 07:46.598
That was my Chai.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.600
Thanks for that.
It's moose urine.

08:00.613 --> 08:02.814
Hi, grandma Ottertale.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.783
Hi.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.618
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.220
I can't.
Helping my dad all day.

08:08.222 --> 08:10.989
Whatever.
More fish for me.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.691
Yeah, you're gonna get bored
when you don't catch anything,

08:12.693 --> 08:13.992
and you're going
to be home early.

08:13.994 --> 08:14.826
No.

08:19.198 --> 08:21.266
Did you catch any fish?

08:21.268 --> 08:22.634
Of course.

08:22.636 --> 08:24.603
Did you see
anything interesting?

08:24.605 --> 08:25.770
No.

08:25.772 --> 08:28.807
Nothing out
of the ordinary. Why?

08:28.809 --> 08:31.843
I've seen an orb last night.

08:31.845 --> 08:32.844
You mean one of
the "bright lights"

08:32.846 --> 08:33.979
that people talk about

08:33.981 --> 08:35.280
after spending too much time

08:35.282 --> 08:36.648
in the sweat lodge?

08:36.650 --> 08:38.817
Yes. It was a green one.

08:38.818 --> 08:40.986
They always come first.

08:40.988 --> 08:43.288
No orbs, grandma.

08:43.289 --> 08:45.690
Okay.

08:45.692 --> 08:46.992
Good luck.

08:57.670 --> 09:00.906
I brought home
a whole bag of fresh trout,

09:00.908 --> 09:04.175
and we're eating
frozen fish sticks.

09:04.177 --> 09:06.545
They're for company.

09:08.781 --> 09:10.782
What company?

09:15.187 --> 09:16.187
What are you doing?

09:16.189 --> 09:19.824
Looking for orbs.

09:19.826 --> 09:21.693
Come on, grandma,
you have to eat

09:21.695 --> 09:22.894
before you take
your heart medicine.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.697
That's probably why
you're seeing orbs.

09:25.699 --> 09:29.334
I'm seeing orbs because
something is gonna happen.

09:29.336 --> 09:31.970
Eat your dinner, please.

09:31.972 --> 09:33.672
Okay.

09:36.343 --> 09:38.043
I got it.

09:42.715 --> 09:43.815
Hey, art.

09:43.817 --> 09:45.317
David.

09:47.353 --> 09:48.820
Hello, Louise.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.956
Hey, Arthur.
Do you want to come in?

09:50.958 --> 09:53.124
No, thanks. I have a lot
on my plate tonight.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.159
Uh-hmm.

09:54.161 --> 09:56.027
Did you see any orbs?

09:56.029 --> 09:57.596
Not lately.

09:57.598 --> 09:59.331
I saw a green one last night.

09:59.333 --> 10:00.332
Really, what time?

10:00.334 --> 10:04.202
What's up, art?

10:04.204 --> 10:07.005
You know, I don't think

10:07.007 --> 10:09.741
bill was hallucinating
out there today.

10:09.743 --> 10:11.876
I don't know.

10:11.878 --> 10:12.877
City guy,

10:12.879 --> 10:14.379
not used to the fresh air.

10:14.381 --> 10:16.715
Probably saw a bear.

10:16.717 --> 10:19.317
You know, that's what
I thought also

10:19.319 --> 10:23.788
until he mentioned
a hairy man, David.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.223
You saw a hairy man?

10:25.225 --> 10:26.658
No, grandma.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.393
Just some crazy tourist
hallucinating

10:28.395 --> 10:29.728
thought he saw him.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.029
He probably did

10:31.031 --> 10:33.665
because he's already here.

10:33.667 --> 10:36.101
You know, why don't you
and Rodney do me a favor

10:36.103 --> 10:39.938
and just take it easy
for a while.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.906
I really don't want
to have to launch

10:41.908 --> 10:44.409
a formal investigation.

10:47.780 --> 10:48.913
Good night, Louise.

10:48.915 --> 10:50.281
Good night, Arthur.

10:50.283 --> 10:53.184
Come again real soon.

10:53.186 --> 10:54.352
Night, art.

10:58.958 --> 11:00.925
God, you're rude.

11:32.725 --> 11:36.461
What the hell is that?

11:36.463 --> 11:38.029
It's cold.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.164
Something's gonna bite me.

11:39.166 --> 11:41.366
You are such as wuss.

11:42.736 --> 11:46.871
You have got to be kidding me.

11:48.240 --> 11:49.474
Bite you,
there's nothing in here

11:49.476 --> 11:51.476
but trout and me,
they won't bite.

11:51.478 --> 11:52.744
No.

11:52.746 --> 11:55.413
I'm not bored, Rodney.

11:56.982 --> 11:59.284
Would you prefer
a sponge bath, princess?

11:59.286 --> 12:00.719
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

12:00.721 --> 12:02.420
Get in this river, you stink.

12:02.422 --> 12:03.755
I do not.

12:06.158 --> 12:07.859
I can't do this.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.734
Well, howdy there, stranger.

12:15.736 --> 12:17.168
Oh, hey,

12:17.170 --> 12:18.169
I'm sorry,

12:18.171 --> 12:20.004
I didn't see you there.

12:20.006 --> 12:21.272
Uh-huh.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.341
How are they biting?

12:23.343 --> 12:24.843
Few little ones.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.211
Nothing to write home about.

12:26.213 --> 12:29.881
You must be using
the wrong pattern.

12:29.883 --> 12:31.783
Let me take a look.

12:31.785 --> 12:33.518
What? Okay.

12:33.520 --> 12:34.819
Of course.

12:41.093 --> 12:42.193
Cadis fly?

12:42.195 --> 12:43.862
Really?

12:43.864 --> 12:46.064
Dude, It's all nymphs
right now.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.165
Nymphs, huh?

12:47.167 --> 12:48.433
Here.

12:48.435 --> 12:52.137
Let me see what we have here.

12:57.076 --> 12:58.209
Here we go.

12:58.211 --> 13:00.245
This is ought to do it.

13:00.247 --> 13:02.347
You do like nymphs, don't you?

13:02.349 --> 13:04.415
I love nymphs.

13:11.490 --> 13:13.792
Give me your rod.
What?

13:13.794 --> 13:16.895
You can't catch a big fish
unless you're naked.

13:16.897 --> 13:19.497
So If I don't get anything
on this next cast,

13:19.499 --> 13:21.432
I'm gonna have to take
my skirt off.

13:21.434 --> 13:22.867
Okay.

13:25.838 --> 13:26.938
Told you.

13:29.141 --> 13:31.142
You do this often?

13:33.979 --> 13:35.213
What?

13:35.215 --> 13:37.048
Fish naked.

13:37.050 --> 13:40.985
Among other things.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.587
Hey, I didn't... I didn't
catch your name.

13:42.589 --> 13:44.055
Amy.

13:44.057 --> 13:46.491
Come on over
after you lose my fish.

13:46.493 --> 13:49.828
Naked hippie chick telling me
not to lose my fish?

13:53.532 --> 13:54.933
Damn it.

13:54.935 --> 13:56.100
Told you.

14:05.110 --> 14:06.244
Enjoy the show?

14:06.246 --> 14:08.313
I was fishing, I wasn't spying.

14:08.315 --> 14:10.281
Oh, relax, Jen.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.050
It's not the first time
someone will masturbate

14:12.052 --> 14:13.251
to the thought of
my wet, naked body.

14:13.253 --> 14:14.319
Amy.
I was...

14:14.321 --> 14:17.021
Relax, both of you.

14:17.023 --> 14:19.457
Totally innocent encounter.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.125
Nice gear.

14:21.127 --> 14:22.126
All right. Come on.

14:22.128 --> 14:23.261
It's almost lunchtime.

14:26.198 --> 14:27.498
Ladies first.

14:37.042 --> 14:38.376
Home sweet home.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.377
What do you think?

14:39.379 --> 14:40.411
<i>What's this?</i>

14:40.413 --> 14:41.412
Home.

14:41.414 --> 14:43.081
Since when?

14:43.083 --> 14:45.149
Oh, Jen and I graduated
last month

14:45.151 --> 14:48.152
and decided to go minimalist
instead of entering the machine.

14:48.154 --> 14:50.188
Minimalist, huh?

14:50.190 --> 14:52.457
So, what did you two study
to drive you out here?

14:52.459 --> 14:54.659
Amy, philosophy,
me, mathematics.

14:54.661 --> 14:58.363
And I wanted to explore
my roots as well.

14:58.365 --> 15:00.298
Nice satellite dish.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.033
It's just for Internet access.

15:02.035 --> 15:03.935
We don't believe in television.

15:03.937 --> 15:05.904
Okay. Okay.

15:11.478 --> 15:15.313
You guys aren't
exactly roughing it.

15:15.315 --> 15:17.048
No one said you had to be
uncomfortable

15:17.050 --> 15:18.182
to commune with nature.

15:18.184 --> 15:20.018
Communing. Yeah.

15:20.020 --> 15:22.520
You're just
a regular pocahontas.

15:24.356 --> 15:27.558
Oh, I like your landscaping.

15:27.560 --> 15:28.559
Oh, really?

15:28.561 --> 15:31.229
You like our landscaping?

15:31.231 --> 15:34.699
Yeah, I don't think you can
handle our landscaping.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.167
Oh, please.

15:36.169 --> 15:38.636
I can handle your landscaping.

15:44.577 --> 15:46.244
I saw the first star.

15:46.246 --> 15:48.279
I get to make a wish.

15:48.281 --> 15:51.416
Do you think
there's alien usses

15:51.418 --> 15:53.418
on another planet

15:53.420 --> 15:55.420
somewhere out there
looking at us

15:55.422 --> 15:57.956
and wondering If there are
other people in the universe?

15:57.958 --> 15:59.457
Cliche.
I feel so small

15:59.459 --> 16:01.092
and insignificant

16:01.094 --> 16:03.227
when I look at the stars.

16:03.229 --> 16:05.063
Cliche, cliche

16:06.166 --> 16:07.465
you are.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.634
Don't be insulting.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.069
I'm serious.

16:11.071 --> 16:12.603
So am I.

16:12.605 --> 16:15.707
We are insignificant,
but who cares?

16:15.709 --> 16:17.442
When you're insignificant,

16:17.444 --> 16:20.244
you don't have any heavy
responsibilities to worry about.

16:25.250 --> 16:26.584
What?

16:26.586 --> 16:29.153
Listen to you, guys.

16:29.155 --> 16:31.689
Come on, I'm the one
with a degree in philosophy,

16:31.691 --> 16:33.492
and you don't hear me
getting all metaphysical

16:33.493 --> 16:35.259
and ruining a perfectly
delightful evening.

16:35.261 --> 16:37.161
Be nice.

16:37.163 --> 16:39.497
Okay. Why do you think
we're here?

16:39.499 --> 16:43.101
I don't know,
and really, I don't care.

16:43.103 --> 16:44.635
Philosophy is crap.

16:44.637 --> 16:46.270
It's not crap.

16:46.272 --> 16:48.272
Not crap.

16:48.274 --> 16:50.608
Yes, it is.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.410
Don't you go to school
or something?

16:52.412 --> 16:54.379
Why should I?

16:54.381 --> 16:56.614
I mean, your degrees
aren't doing you much good.

16:56.616 --> 16:59.183
That's not true!

17:00.387 --> 17:02.487
You're a liar.
That's not true.

17:02.489 --> 17:05.323
Oh, shit, I got to go.

17:05.325 --> 17:09.093
Aw, does little Davie
have a curfew?

17:09.095 --> 17:11.429
I got to go check
on my grandma.

17:11.431 --> 17:13.531
You have two beautiful,

17:13.532 --> 17:15.733
horny women alone in the woods,

17:15.734 --> 17:18.169
and you really want
to go check on "grandma"?

17:18.171 --> 17:20.038
We're lonely.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.807
Look, If I don't give my grandma
her medicine, she won't take it.

17:22.809 --> 17:25.108
Suit yourself.
I understand.

17:25.111 --> 17:27.278
We might be too much for you.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.647
We don't have to
torture him this much.

17:29.649 --> 17:31.049
But It's so fun.

17:33.653 --> 17:35.119
He has to take care of
his grandmother.

17:35.121 --> 17:36.721
Oh, wait, I'm horny.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.322
David, wait a minute.

17:38.324 --> 17:40.391
David, David, wait a second.

17:40.393 --> 17:43.061
Look, I really need
to check on my grandma.

17:43.063 --> 17:44.262
It's cool.

17:44.264 --> 17:45.830
Amy's a terrible tease.

17:45.832 --> 17:47.365
Really?

17:47.367 --> 17:48.699
Okay. Actually,
she's not a tease,

17:48.701 --> 17:50.635
she'd probably follow through.

17:50.637 --> 17:53.204
Yeah, that makes me feel
so much better.

17:53.206 --> 17:54.572
Don't worry,
we're not going anywhere.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.307
Just come back
the day after tomorrow.

17:56.309 --> 17:57.642
What's wrong with tomorrow?

17:57.644 --> 18:00.278
We have to go
into town for supplies.

18:00.280 --> 18:02.246
Come here.

18:03.449 --> 18:05.650
Now take care of grandma.

18:05.652 --> 18:07.418
Right.

18:07.420 --> 18:08.786
Grandma.

18:08.788 --> 18:12.123
Medicine.

18:13.560 --> 18:16.527
She probably won't die
If she just misses one.

18:19.765 --> 18:22.733
Oh, no.

18:27.372 --> 18:30.374
<i>Hey, art, where the hell</i>
<i>are you?</i>

18:34.379 --> 18:36.814
Oh, hey, David.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.649
Hey, art.

18:38.651 --> 18:40.218
What's up?

18:40.220 --> 18:42.653
Oh, just dropped by
to check in.

18:42.655 --> 18:44.622
Why?

18:46.258 --> 18:49.594
You know, just making
my rounds.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.131
See you later, Louise.

18:53.133 --> 18:54.765
Yeah, bye, Arthur.

18:54.767 --> 18:57.602
Oh, here, your badge.

19:00.606 --> 19:02.306
<i>Hey, art,</i>

19:02.308 --> 19:03.875
<i>think you better get over here.</i>

19:19.191 --> 19:20.925
Why are you wearing your robe?

19:20.927 --> 19:22.793
I took my medicine.

19:22.795 --> 19:27.365
That's great, grandma.

19:27.367 --> 19:29.700
What was art doing here
so late?

19:29.702 --> 19:31.569
He's just checking on me.

19:31.571 --> 19:33.504
I'm gonna sleep here tonight.

19:33.506 --> 19:34.872
Why?

19:34.874 --> 19:37.675
I'm looking for orbs.

19:43.215 --> 19:46.851
Are you sure you not taking
too much of your medicine?

19:46.853 --> 19:47.885
Yes.

19:47.887 --> 19:49.554
Smells like you are.

19:49.556 --> 19:51.422
Did you get any fish?

19:51.424 --> 19:52.890
Yes.

19:54.359 --> 19:56.360
Just double checking.

19:56.362 --> 19:59.430
What?

19:59.432 --> 20:01.499
What are you doing?

20:01.501 --> 20:03.301
Feeding hairy man.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.539
Let's go to bed, grandma.

20:08.541 --> 20:12.710
I'm sleeping here tonight
in case orbs come.

20:12.712 --> 20:15.346
Grandma, It's gonna
be cold tonight,

20:15.348 --> 20:16.747
and I won't be able to sleep

20:16.749 --> 20:19.283
If I think you're out here
freezing to death.

20:19.285 --> 20:22.453
I won't freeze If you
give me my blanket back.

20:22.455 --> 20:23.888
Come on.

20:27.926 --> 20:29.627
Shit.

20:31.630 --> 20:34.465
You treat me
like a little girl.

20:34.467 --> 20:36.667
I'm sorry, grandma.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.884
You really like messing
with people, don't you?

20:53.886 --> 20:55.019
What do you mean?

20:55.021 --> 20:57.388
You know what I mean.
David.

20:57.390 --> 20:59.657
He looked like he was gonna
explode when he left here.

20:59.659 --> 21:01.726
It's good to keep
guys guessing.

21:01.728 --> 21:02.827
Guessing?

21:02.829 --> 21:05.029
He's probably lying in bed

21:05.031 --> 21:06.664
imagining the two of us

21:06.666 --> 21:09.600
in the throes of
crazy lesbian sex.

21:11.371 --> 21:14.305
I'd hate to let
the little guy down.

21:14.307 --> 21:16.574
No, no, no, no, no.

21:16.576 --> 21:17.575
Nice try.

21:17.577 --> 21:19.443
Head games with guys, fine,

21:19.445 --> 21:21.012
but not with me.

21:21.014 --> 21:22.580
I got to pee.

21:22.582 --> 21:26.584
You want to explore
your roots with David.

21:26.586 --> 21:28.619
Maybe.

21:28.621 --> 21:31.856
She better not be thinking
about experimenting.

21:31.858 --> 21:33.624
It's really bad enough I
have to deal with bugs

21:33.626 --> 21:38.496
and snakes,
and other creepy-crawly shit.

21:52.511 --> 21:56.080
I'm tired, Ames,
stop messing around.

21:56.082 --> 21:58.582
I'm serious.

21:58.584 --> 22:00.051
Amy, It's not polite

22:00.053 --> 22:02.520
to shine a light on someone
when they're peeing.

22:03.722 --> 22:04.922
Thank you.

22:13.533 --> 22:15.633
When did you get
the green flashlight?

22:15.635 --> 22:16.801
What?

22:16.803 --> 22:18.569
You know,

22:18.571 --> 22:22.106
the green light you were shining
on me when I was peeing.

22:22.108 --> 22:24.108
What are you talking about?

22:24.110 --> 22:27.078
You weren't shining
a green light on me?

22:27.080 --> 22:29.580
I told you
that was strong stuff.

22:29.582 --> 22:30.614
Stop messing with me.

22:30.616 --> 22:31.982
I didn't smoke that much.

22:31.984 --> 22:34.352
I think you did.

22:34.354 --> 22:36.387
Seriously, you're not
messing with me?

22:36.389 --> 22:38.923
No.

22:38.925 --> 22:41.359
That is some good landscaping.

22:41.361 --> 22:42.827
Mm-hmm.

23:06.952 --> 23:08.452
Watch those raccoons, grandma.

23:08.454 --> 23:10.454
I might be late.
Okay.

23:10.456 --> 23:11.956
You'll take
your medicine, right?

23:11.958 --> 23:13.657
Okay.

23:15.761 --> 23:16.794
What?

23:16.796 --> 23:18.062
Oh, aren't you going to wish

23:18.064 --> 23:20.131
you came fishing
with me yesterday.

23:20.133 --> 23:23.134
Better than slave
laboring with my dad?

23:37.015 --> 23:38.549
Ow!
Get out.

23:38.551 --> 23:39.550
Why?

23:39.552 --> 23:40.951
Get the fuck out.

23:40.953 --> 23:42.887
You're smoking herb
with not one but two

23:42.889 --> 23:45.523
hot, naked hippie chicks
all day and you ask me why?

23:45.525 --> 23:47.758
You should've called me,
you asshole.

23:47.760 --> 23:48.859
Ugh!

23:48.861 --> 23:49.960
Ow, frick you, man.

23:49.962 --> 23:50.961
Yeah, it burns.

23:50.963 --> 23:52.863
I didn't have a phone.

23:52.865 --> 23:54.226
Well, then
you should've found one.

23:58.136 --> 24:00.070
Seriously, dude, what the fuck?

24:00.072 --> 24:02.006
You lucky bastard.

24:02.008 --> 24:06.510
That's like... that's like
"penthouse" forum shit.

24:06.512 --> 24:08.946
It really wasn't that exciting.

24:08.948 --> 24:11.649
What, you didn't seal the deal?
No.

24:11.651 --> 24:13.517
I had to make sure my
grandma took her medicine.

24:13.519 --> 24:15.920
Oh, man. Your priorities
are so messed up.

24:15.922 --> 24:18.155
Okay, whatever.
No.

24:18.157 --> 24:19.924
Okay, where are we going?

24:19.926 --> 24:21.225
You mean before
we go back and visit

24:21.227 --> 24:23.828
your soon to be
ex-girlfriends?

24:23.830 --> 24:26.163
They're in town today.
Shit.

24:26.165 --> 24:28.732
Okay. We'll go to South fork.

24:28.734 --> 24:31.035
South fork?

24:31.037 --> 24:33.904
The fishing sucks,
and It's full of tourists.

24:33.906 --> 24:35.139
Exactly.

24:35.141 --> 24:38.008
Time to generate
some media cred.

24:38.010 --> 24:40.478
Oh, you're good, you.

24:49.788 --> 24:52.056
Man, you are a mess.

24:52.058 --> 24:53.891
- Rc.
- Yeah, Bob.

24:53.893 --> 24:55.659
Hey, rc, I'm kind of
hung-up here.

24:55.661 --> 24:56.994
Could you give me a hand?

24:56.996 --> 24:58.696
You know, Bob, part
of being a fly-fisherman

24:58.698 --> 25:00.698
is learning how to get
yourself untangled there.

25:00.700 --> 25:03.767
I'd cut you loose, but I'd be
doing you a disservice.

25:03.769 --> 25:05.135
Hey, rc.

25:05.137 --> 25:07.805
Any luck today?

25:07.807 --> 25:10.274
Man, these are gonna be
so great on mugbook.

25:11.910 --> 25:13.210
Never mind.

25:13.212 --> 25:14.879
Yeah. Hey, It's good to see
you're not joined

25:14.881 --> 25:16.847
to the hip with
that criminal, David.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.282
Come on, man.

25:18.284 --> 25:19.984
That was a bullshit charge,

25:19.986 --> 25:21.218
and you know it.

25:21.220 --> 25:22.219
Yeah, bullshit charge.

25:22.221 --> 25:23.888
He steals art's patrol car

25:23.890 --> 25:24.922
and drives through
the post office,

25:24.924 --> 25:26.824
and that's a bullshit charge.

25:26.826 --> 25:29.126
No one saw him.
Yeah, okay.

25:29.128 --> 25:30.861
Hey, David, when are you
coming by the shop?

25:30.863 --> 25:32.763
I'm out of
stimulators, parachutes,

25:32.765 --> 25:35.165
wooly buggers, and I'm
low on everything else.

25:35.167 --> 25:36.834
Next couple of days?
Okay.

25:36.836 --> 25:38.903
What the hell is that?

25:38.905 --> 25:40.271
Hairy man.

25:44.609 --> 25:46.243
Oh, shit. David, really?

25:46.245 --> 25:49.213
You might know him as bigfoot.

25:49.215 --> 25:51.148
Hey, where you going?

25:51.150 --> 25:52.950
Fishing.

25:52.952 --> 25:56.587
Fish are all too scared
down here. Later, rc.

25:56.589 --> 25:58.155
Seriously, we just saw bigfoot

25:58.157 --> 25:59.890
- on the north fork river.
- South fork.

25:59.892 --> 26:00.891
South fork river.

26:00.893 --> 26:02.793
We got a photo of it.

26:02.795 --> 26:04.228
<i>Yes, that's right, Chet.</i>

26:04.230 --> 26:06.797
<i>We are live</i>
<i>with tonight's big story.</i>

26:06.799 --> 26:08.966
<i>Bigfoot</i>
<i>on the South fork river.</i>

26:08.968 --> 26:11.101
<i>We wanna show you</i>
<i>a very dramatic photograph</i>

26:11.103 --> 26:13.604
<i>that was just taken hours ago.</i>
<i>Take a look.</i>

26:13.606 --> 26:14.805
<i>Now, it is blurry...</i>

26:14.807 --> 26:17.808
Hey, grandma.

26:17.810 --> 26:20.010
<i>Some kind of creature...</i>

26:20.012 --> 26:21.211
What are you watching?

26:21.213 --> 26:22.813
News.

26:22.815 --> 26:25.349
Tourists think
they saw a bigfoot.

26:25.351 --> 26:28.619
Holy shit.

26:28.621 --> 26:30.354
<i>- No.</i>
<i>- Charlie Murphy.</i>

26:30.356 --> 26:32.790
<i>Charlie Murphy,</i>
<i>you were the one responsible.</i>

26:32.792 --> 26:35.326
<i>Now that looks like a</i>
<i>very fancy piece of equipment.</i>

26:35.328 --> 26:37.161
<i>With no due respect, sir,</i>

26:37.163 --> 26:40.731
<i>why is this photo so blurry?</i>

26:40.733 --> 26:44.635
<i>Well, the... I had on</i>
<i>a really wide lens,</i>

26:44.637 --> 26:47.805
<i>and the creature,</i>
<i>this big hairy thing</i>

26:47.807 --> 26:49.640
<i>looked and moved more like</i>
<i>an ape than a man.</i>

26:49.642 --> 26:51.609
<i>He was really way upstream</i>

26:51.611 --> 26:53.277
<i>and I might have had the...</i>
<i>I might have knocked</i>

26:53.279 --> 26:55.679
<i>the auto-focus off</i>
<i>in the excitement,</i>

26:55.681 --> 26:57.748
<i>but what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna get my really long lens,</i>

26:57.750 --> 26:59.283
<i>and I'm gonna come back</i>
<i>out here every day</i>

26:59.285 --> 27:01.118
<i>until I get a better picture.</i>
<i>Every day?</i>

27:01.120 --> 27:02.786
<i>Now, why would you want</i>
<i>to be out here every day?</i>

27:02.788 --> 27:03.954
<i>To get a better picture.</i>

27:03.956 --> 27:06.657
What a douche bag.

27:22.173 --> 27:23.774
How close are we getting?

27:23.776 --> 27:26.276
Right up around the bend,
just chill.

27:26.278 --> 27:28.178
Nice.

27:28.180 --> 27:29.847
I said chill.

27:33.885 --> 27:35.419
They were in
the middle of the stream

27:35.421 --> 27:37.154
just off that little path
by the rock.

27:37.156 --> 27:38.355
Well, they're not there now.

27:38.357 --> 27:39.757
What are you fellas
looking for?

27:39.759 --> 27:41.291
Oh, Amy, Jen.
We were just...

27:41.293 --> 27:43.127
Hoping to find her naked
in the river?

27:43.129 --> 27:44.995
Yes.
No.

27:47.365 --> 27:49.333
This is Rodney.
What's up, ladies?

27:49.335 --> 27:50.968
Wow.

27:50.970 --> 27:52.369
A new fan.

27:52.371 --> 27:54.304
I hope you're not
too disappointed, Rodney.

27:54.306 --> 27:55.706
Of course not.

27:55.708 --> 27:57.307
You know, David,
this makes two strikes.

27:57.309 --> 27:59.143
What do you mean?

27:59.145 --> 28:01.045
Well, you didn't come
by yesterday.

28:01.047 --> 28:04.682
Jen and I just had
to satisfy each other.

28:04.684 --> 28:07.084
Jen said you guys
were going into town.

28:07.086 --> 28:08.886
Silly, silly boy.

28:08.888 --> 28:10.954
And today, you brought a friend
without our permission.

28:10.956 --> 28:12.990
I'm Rodney.

28:12.992 --> 28:14.358
Okay, I'm Rodney.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.193
Amy. And this is Jen.

28:16.195 --> 28:17.895
Nice to meet you.

28:17.897 --> 28:18.996
Doesn't look like those lines

28:18.998 --> 28:20.464
have been in the water yet.

28:22.167 --> 28:23.333
Since you're not fishing,

28:23.335 --> 28:24.968
you can help us
with our laundry.

28:26.237 --> 28:28.005
I'm not really a laundry guy.

28:28.007 --> 28:30.007
Oh, really?
That's too bad.

28:30.009 --> 28:32.443
I haven't taken off everything
I need to wash just yet.

28:50.462 --> 28:53.130
Nice to see you
hardly working, Rodney.

28:53.132 --> 28:54.431
Well, I'm keeping busy.

28:54.433 --> 28:56.433
I see that.

28:56.435 --> 28:59.203
David understands
how to treat women.

28:59.205 --> 29:03.006
We can be very grateful
to men like him.

29:03.008 --> 29:04.374
Hey, David.

29:04.376 --> 29:06.844
Do you mind washing this, too?

29:11.750 --> 29:13.450
May I have my vest back?

29:13.452 --> 29:15.519
No.

29:15.521 --> 29:17.521
So, David,

29:17.523 --> 29:19.423
you're first nations, right?

29:19.425 --> 29:20.424
Mostly.

29:20.426 --> 29:22.893
Mostly?

29:22.895 --> 29:26.964
My grandfather's white,
but I never met him.

29:26.966 --> 29:28.232
Why?

29:28.234 --> 29:29.800
Damn girl, you're nosy.

29:29.802 --> 29:31.068
I'm sorry.
I can't help it.

29:31.070 --> 29:32.469
I was raised in the city.

29:32.471 --> 29:34.371
I'm guessing
it wasn't the projects.

29:34.373 --> 29:37.808
What tribe do you belong to?

29:37.810 --> 29:42.146
Actually, I don't know
anything about my heritage.

29:42.148 --> 29:45.015
Do you wanna hear my story?

29:45.017 --> 29:46.383
Yeah, please.

29:46.385 --> 29:48.919
Here we go.

29:48.921 --> 29:51.421
My grandfather
was a rodeo clown

29:51.423 --> 29:54.458
with a penchant for
four-legged companionship.

29:54.460 --> 29:59.129
He met an untimely demise
when he was crushed by a bull.

29:59.131 --> 30:00.430
My mother got knocked up

30:00.432 --> 30:03.000
by her university
first nations t.A.

30:03.002 --> 30:04.902
Freshman year of college.

30:04.904 --> 30:06.303
As soon as I was born,

30:06.305 --> 30:08.906
they split
for an ashram in France.

30:08.908 --> 30:11.175
My childhood was typical.

30:11.177 --> 30:13.944
Trout fishing and sweat lodges.

30:13.946 --> 30:16.180
Each spring, we'd migrate down
to the lowlands

30:16.182 --> 30:18.015
where we would trap moose

30:18.017 --> 30:20.150
and dance naked under
the lunar eclipses

30:20.152 --> 30:22.853
committing pagan acts
of defiance.

30:22.855 --> 30:25.289
Pretty standard
first nations stuff, really.

30:25.291 --> 30:28.158
He's jerking your chain, Jen.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.393
Don't mock him, Amy.

30:29.395 --> 30:31.862
<i>It's all true.</i>
Right.

30:31.864 --> 30:34.431
It is.
Seriously, It's all true.

30:34.433 --> 30:37.601
Trapping moose?

30:37.603 --> 30:40.838
My grandfather was a rodeo clown
who got crushed by a bull.

30:40.840 --> 30:42.072
Should've known.

30:42.074 --> 30:46.443
I'm afraid
that's actually true.

30:46.445 --> 30:48.378
That's so sad.

30:50.915 --> 30:52.449
Your life is the weirdest.

30:57.622 --> 30:59.990
Hey, David.

30:59.992 --> 31:01.925
Damn, you are such a tease.

31:01.927 --> 31:03.160
Woo.

31:03.162 --> 31:05.362
God, you guys did
a terrible job washing.

31:05.364 --> 31:07.598
Still smells
like a bag of assholes.

31:07.600 --> 31:10.400
I don't think
It's your clothes.

31:10.402 --> 31:12.236
I think something
died in the woods.

31:12.238 --> 31:13.570
Gross.

31:23.915 --> 31:26.016
- Dude.
- I told you.

31:26.018 --> 31:29.219
Oh, so you don't want us
for our bodies, just our pot?

31:29.221 --> 31:30.487
Both, please.

31:33.057 --> 31:35.559
So, what are these orb things?

31:35.561 --> 31:36.960
I don't know.

31:36.962 --> 31:38.896
Like I said,
I've never seen one.

31:38.898 --> 31:41.198
Is it like "close encounters"
kind of stuff

31:41.200 --> 31:43.033
or like "x-files"
kind of stuff?

31:43.035 --> 31:45.002
They're described
as glowing balls of light

31:45.004 --> 31:47.004
that move through the sky.

31:47.006 --> 31:48.205
What color are they?

31:48.207 --> 31:50.340
Why are you so interested?

31:50.342 --> 31:52.309
I thought Amy was shining
a flashlight on me

31:52.311 --> 31:54.511
when I was peeing
after you left the other day.

31:54.513 --> 31:56.680
She said I was hallucinating.

31:56.682 --> 31:59.049
You think it was an orb?

31:59.051 --> 32:00.484
Could be.

32:00.486 --> 32:03.220
But most people
that claim to have seen them

32:03.222 --> 32:06.089
are hallucinating
on a pretty regular basis.

32:06.091 --> 32:08.258
Great.

32:08.260 --> 32:11.061
Oh.

32:11.063 --> 32:12.229
Wow.

32:12.231 --> 32:14.965
I like these.

32:14.967 --> 32:16.366
Mine.

32:16.368 --> 32:18.035
Really?

32:18.037 --> 32:21.038
Amy likes to go commando.

32:21.040 --> 32:23.974
This is incredible.

32:23.976 --> 32:25.409
<i>What did I tell you?</i>

32:25.411 --> 32:27.010
Got something
out of my studies.

32:27.012 --> 32:29.112
A little minor in horticulture.

32:29.114 --> 32:30.681
Why don't you guys
stick around for dinner?

32:30.683 --> 32:32.649
We can get baked
and tell ufo stories.

32:32.651 --> 32:34.351
Works for me.

32:39.257 --> 32:42.592
Then the hairy, grotesque arm

32:42.594 --> 32:46.596
reached under her covers
to her milky white breast.

32:48.533 --> 32:50.400
She tried to scream out

32:50.402 --> 32:53.270
but was overcome
by his extraterrestrial lust

32:53.272 --> 32:56.006
being telepathically
projected into her mind,

32:56.008 --> 32:58.575
and she gratefully...
Oh, man.

32:58.577 --> 33:00.143
That is worse
than ghost stories

33:00.145 --> 33:03.146
I heard at middle school
sleepovers.

33:06.484 --> 33:08.518
It's kind of spooky.

33:10.121 --> 33:11.321
I got to pee.

33:22.134 --> 33:24.267
Hello, trusty rock.

33:33.344 --> 33:36.380
Come on, guys,
a little privacy.

33:38.750 --> 33:42.285
Jeez, Louise,
turn off the flashlight!

33:45.156 --> 33:47.157
How are you doing that?

34:03.242 --> 34:04.775
<i>Better ghost story</i>
<i>than you thought it was.</i>

34:04.777 --> 34:07.344
I saw an orb.

34:07.346 --> 34:09.212
You didn't see the lights?

34:09.214 --> 34:11.281
No, no lights.

34:11.283 --> 34:13.717
I think you might have been
hallucinating again, sweetheart.

34:13.719 --> 34:15.418
Bullshit. Your shit
isn't that good.

34:15.420 --> 34:17.286
I'm freaking out here.

34:17.289 --> 34:18.688
We're living out
in the middle of nowhere,

34:18.690 --> 34:21.158
and I'm getting buzzed
by alien orbs.

34:22.226 --> 34:23.560
<i>Was it threatening?</i>

34:23.562 --> 34:25.829
Yeah, it hovered over me
while I was peeing.

34:25.831 --> 34:28.565
I'd hover over you peeing,
while you were peeing.

34:28.567 --> 34:30.500
Shut up, Rodney.

34:30.502 --> 34:33.402
I'm going to bed.

34:33.405 --> 34:34.704
Bedtime.

34:34.706 --> 34:37.274
<i>Alone.</i>

34:47.786 --> 34:50.152
No, man, I'm good.

34:52.190 --> 34:55.659
Denied, huh?

34:55.661 --> 34:57.794
They're city girls.

34:57.796 --> 35:02.299
We're just not
real options for them.

35:02.301 --> 35:04.367
I'm not willing to give up
that easily, buddy.

35:04.369 --> 35:07.671
I never said anything
about giving up.

35:07.673 --> 35:08.873
That's what I'm talking about.

35:08.874 --> 35:11.341
Boom.
Yeah.

35:11.343 --> 35:12.642
That's good shit.

35:12.644 --> 35:15.312
Sure got Jen all freaked out.

35:15.314 --> 35:16.713
I don't know.

35:16.715 --> 35:19.483
I was watching her,
and I don't think

35:19.485 --> 35:22.152
she took a real drag all night.

35:22.154 --> 35:23.653
What, you think she faked it?

35:23.655 --> 35:26.423
She seemed like
she was really freaked.

35:26.425 --> 35:28.325
She probably just saw an owl.

35:28.327 --> 35:30.260
Chicks are crazy.

35:30.262 --> 35:31.261
Yeah.

35:31.263 --> 35:33.296
I don't know.

35:33.298 --> 35:36.299
Grandma said she saw
one last night.

35:36.301 --> 35:39.336
Bro, with all due respect,

35:39.338 --> 35:42.506
your grandma is crazier
than bat-shit pancakes.

35:47.211 --> 35:48.512
I think It's time for hairy man

35:48.514 --> 35:51.515
to pay our new friends a visit.

35:51.517 --> 35:53.717
Man, Jen gets scared again

35:53.719 --> 35:56.686
and I think she's just gone.

35:56.688 --> 35:59.456
So, you don't think
the chance of a three-way

35:59.458 --> 36:01.858
in the woods is worth the risk?

36:01.860 --> 36:03.894
Think about it.

36:03.896 --> 36:05.695
Huh?

36:05.697 --> 36:09.900
Well, when you put it
that way, it might work.

36:09.902 --> 36:12.335
Yeah, you bet your ass
it'll work, man.

36:12.337 --> 36:15.405
As soon as they see hairy man,
they're going to be so grateful

36:15.407 --> 36:16.773
for your protection,

36:16.775 --> 36:19.543
they're going
to be like, "uhhhhh!"

36:19.545 --> 36:21.811
Am I right?
Oh, yeah.

36:21.813 --> 36:24.381
Squid.

36:24.383 --> 36:25.715
Really?

36:30.755 --> 36:32.756
All right.
See you tomorrow.

37:00.885 --> 37:02.586
<i>Did you catch any fish?</i>

37:02.588 --> 37:04.754
Oh, shit!

37:06.591 --> 37:08.625
Did you trip?

37:08.627 --> 37:09.726
Yes, grandma.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.995
I tripped.

37:11.997 --> 37:15.265
Why the hell are you
sitting in the dark?

37:15.267 --> 37:18.535
I'm watching orbs.

37:18.537 --> 37:21.671
Great. More orbs.

37:21.673 --> 37:23.673
No, just one.

37:23.675 --> 37:25.408
You saw another orb?

37:25.410 --> 37:26.710
Mm-hmm.

37:26.712 --> 37:30.247
I like the blue ones.

37:30.249 --> 37:32.616
What time did you see it?

37:32.618 --> 37:34.651
Just a few hours ago.

37:34.653 --> 37:38.288
It just zipped by
like it was scared.

37:38.290 --> 37:40.490
A scared orb?

37:40.492 --> 37:42.259
Mm-hmm.

37:42.261 --> 37:44.928
I can't see anything
with the light on.

37:47.598 --> 37:52.602
So, did you and Rodney
get laid tonight?

37:52.604 --> 37:55.538
Grandma!

37:55.540 --> 37:56.706
No.

37:56.708 --> 37:58.508
Oh.

37:58.510 --> 38:00.677
Maybe next time.

38:00.679 --> 38:02.812
You both could use it.

38:10.454 --> 38:12.455
Just make sure you keep taking
your meds, Louise.

38:12.457 --> 38:13.623
I will.

38:17.862 --> 38:19.996
Hey, grandma,
I just need to ask

38:19.998 --> 38:21.531
the doctor a couple
of questions.

38:21.533 --> 38:23.633
I'm fine.

38:23.635 --> 38:24.834
Why don't you freshen up

38:24.836 --> 38:26.469
and I'll meet you in the lobby?

38:26.471 --> 38:27.971
Fine, I get it.

38:27.973 --> 38:29.939
Don't let him commit me,
okay, Sharon?

38:29.941 --> 38:31.574
I won't, Louise.

38:35.012 --> 38:36.746
I'm worried about her, doc.

38:36.748 --> 38:38.048
You don't need to be.

38:38.050 --> 38:39.449
She's going
to out-live us both

38:39.451 --> 38:41.084
so long as she keeps
taking her meds.

38:41.086 --> 38:42.852
I'm not worried
about her physical health.

38:42.854 --> 38:46.089
She's starting to live like
she is in the old legends.

38:46.091 --> 38:47.891
What do you mean?

38:47.893 --> 38:51.895
She Says she's seeing
orbs and...

38:52.898 --> 38:54.564
hairy man.

38:54.566 --> 38:56.399
Are you sure
she's not seeing them?

38:56.401 --> 38:58.335
There have been
a few sightings recently.

38:58.337 --> 39:00.603
Oh, she thinks that she's
that she's seeing them.

39:00.605 --> 39:02.572
She's been a little eccentric
since I was a kid.

39:02.574 --> 39:05.408
I'd roll with it.

39:05.410 --> 39:07.444
Isn't there anything
we can do to stop it?

39:07.446 --> 39:11.748
I don't think she has
anything to treat.

39:11.750 --> 39:12.916
I tell you what,

39:12.918 --> 39:14.751
If anything changes,
let me know,

39:14.753 --> 39:17.987
and We'll explore some options.

39:17.989 --> 39:19.389
Okay.

39:19.391 --> 39:20.457
Thanks.

39:20.459 --> 39:22.025
Of course.

39:30.035 --> 39:32.736
I'm not crazy.

39:32.738 --> 39:34.771
I never said
you were crazy, grandma.

39:34.773 --> 39:36.639
But you think I am.

39:36.641 --> 39:38.475
You are seeing things, grandma.

39:38.477 --> 39:39.776
Uh-huh.

39:39.778 --> 39:41.578
Hallucinations aren't real.

39:41.580 --> 39:44.047
I'm not hallucinating.

39:44.049 --> 39:47.150
You are seeing orbs
and talking to hairy man.

39:47.152 --> 39:48.551
Uh-huh.

39:48.553 --> 39:49.719
No one else is seeing orbs

39:49.721 --> 39:51.454
or talking to hairy man.

39:51.456 --> 39:53.790
He doesn't want to talk
to anyone else.

39:53.792 --> 39:55.558
He's on vacation.

39:55.560 --> 39:57.627
And It's not my fault

39:57.629 --> 40:00.497
no one takes the time
to look away

40:00.499 --> 40:01.898
from their TV long enough

40:01.900 --> 40:05.668
to see what's going on
around them.

40:05.670 --> 40:07.704
Hairy man is on vacation?

40:07.706 --> 40:09.105
Uh-huh.

40:09.107 --> 40:12.108
Do me a favor,
ask If I can talk to him.

40:12.110 --> 40:13.476
I don't think so.

40:13.478 --> 40:14.644
Why not?

40:14.646 --> 40:16.479
Because he's on vacation,

40:16.481 --> 40:18.882
and you're not relaxed.

40:20.519 --> 40:22.519
All right, grandma.

40:55.519 --> 40:56.686
Amy?

40:59.490 --> 41:00.657
Jen?

41:09.533 --> 41:11.701
Amy?

41:11.703 --> 41:12.869
Jen?

41:21.879 --> 41:23.079
They're not here.

41:25.716 --> 41:27.116
Well, this sucks.

41:28.853 --> 41:31.054
They're probably
just out banging bankers.

41:31.056 --> 41:32.989
Way to be the optimist.

41:32.991 --> 41:34.190
I'm a realist.

41:34.192 --> 41:36.159
Whatever, let's just go.

41:36.161 --> 41:37.660
I don't know,
It's getting late.

41:37.662 --> 41:38.728
They'll probably be back soon.

41:38.730 --> 41:40.096
Or they just left.

41:40.098 --> 41:41.130
Guess I shouldn't
have taken so long

41:41.132 --> 41:42.565
catching all these fish.

41:42.567 --> 41:44.033
That's what I told you, man.

41:44.035 --> 41:46.169
That's like two days
worth of trout, not dinner.

41:46.171 --> 41:48.671
Okay, whatever. Let's just
get the hell out of here.

41:48.673 --> 41:49.873
Fine.

41:53.711 --> 41:56.513
They were definitely
hoping to find us both naked.

41:56.515 --> 41:57.947
Shit, they're here.

41:57.949 --> 41:59.582
Hide.

41:59.584 --> 42:00.984
<i>Seriously?</i>

42:00.986 --> 42:03.520
<i>They're, like, standing</i>
<i>in the water?</i>

42:03.522 --> 42:05.622
Obviously, like, that's
what you're up to.

42:05.624 --> 42:06.956
Bras are not in here.

42:08.760 --> 42:09.926
<i>Of course I can believe it,</i>

42:09.928 --> 42:11.828
they're a couple
of punk-ass jerks.

42:11.830 --> 42:13.062
<i>Hello, ladies.</i>

42:13.064 --> 42:14.230
You startled me.

42:14.232 --> 42:15.899
What are you doing here?

42:15.901 --> 42:18.535
I just caught some nice fish

42:18.537 --> 42:20.169
<i>and thought I'd bring</i>
<i>them by for dinner.</i>

42:20.171 --> 42:22.805
Nice timing. We just went
to town for groceries.

42:22.807 --> 42:25.742
So, see any more orbs
last night?

42:25.744 --> 42:27.744
Don't tease me.

42:28.946 --> 42:31.080
My grandma saw some last night.

42:31.082 --> 42:34.017
She likes the blue ones.

42:34.019 --> 42:35.585
The one I saw was blue.

42:35.587 --> 42:38.054
Really?
Yes, really.

42:38.056 --> 42:40.056
I didn't sleep a minute last
night, and now you're telling me

42:40.058 --> 42:41.724
I might have actually
seen something?

42:41.726 --> 42:42.926
I don't know.

42:42.928 --> 42:44.294
I just know my grandma saw one.

42:44.296 --> 42:45.828
I didn't see anything.

42:45.830 --> 42:47.597
Look, Jen, we went to town,

42:47.599 --> 42:49.265
you've had your pedicure
and your facial,

42:49.267 --> 42:51.267
we've got groceries,
everything is good.

42:51.269 --> 42:53.803
I'm telling you both,
I saw something.

42:53.805 --> 42:54.837
Maybe you did.

42:54.839 --> 42:57.106
Look, all I'm saying is...

42:58.609 --> 43:01.244
Maybe someone's
messing with us.

43:01.246 --> 43:02.679
Amy.

43:02.681 --> 43:05.148
Come back here,
you little fucker!

43:05.150 --> 43:07.116
Oh, my God! Don't chase
that thing into the woods!

43:21.665 --> 43:24.067
What should we do?

43:24.069 --> 43:25.301
She'll be back soon.

43:38.215 --> 43:39.882
She could be dead right now.

43:44.288 --> 43:46.022
I'm pretty sure the creature

43:46.024 --> 43:48.024
is in more danger
than she is right now.

43:54.064 --> 43:56.799
I'll kill you!
Okay, okay, I give, I give!

43:56.801 --> 43:58.401
Rodney?

43:59.771 --> 44:01.371
What the hell is this?

44:01.373 --> 44:03.172
Bigfoot suit.

44:03.174 --> 44:05.708
Ow, ow, ow!
Dirty bitch! Ow, ow!

44:09.913 --> 44:11.381
That didn't take very long.

44:13.083 --> 44:15.084
Amy?!

44:17.087 --> 44:18.421
Rodney here is
pretty out of shape

44:18.423 --> 44:20.289
for a young guy.

44:22.993 --> 44:25.061
What the hell is going on?

44:25.063 --> 44:26.396
Looks like our two new friends

44:26.398 --> 44:28.398
were trying to scare
the hell out of us.

44:28.400 --> 44:29.699
Why would you do that?

44:29.701 --> 44:32.101
It was a bad idea.
I'm sorry.

44:32.103 --> 44:34.804
Bad idea? That is
way beyond a bad idea.

44:34.806 --> 44:36.773
Oh, Jen, according
to Rodney here,

44:36.775 --> 44:38.708
we should be flattered.
What?

44:38.710 --> 44:40.176
Rodney was taking one
for the team and hoping

44:40.178 --> 44:41.944
he might scare us both
into David's arms.

44:41.946 --> 44:43.913
Are you serious?

44:43.915 --> 44:46.282
That is the dumbest idea
I've ever heard!

44:48.253 --> 44:49.919
You don't get to laugh.

44:49.921 --> 44:51.020
I guess that's sort
of flattering

44:51.022 --> 44:53.122
in a prepubescent sort of way.

44:53.124 --> 44:54.457
This is quite the plot

44:54.459 --> 44:57.093
you hatched out
to get a little lovin'.

44:57.095 --> 44:59.696
We just figured since Jen
saw that orb the other night,

44:59.698 --> 45:01.764
we'd give it a shot.

45:01.766 --> 45:03.466
We've actually been
using the same gag

45:03.468 --> 45:05.001
for quite some time.

45:05.003 --> 45:06.402
You mean there are
other beautiful girls

45:06.404 --> 45:08.204
out here in the woods?

45:08.206 --> 45:10.306
We wish. You guys are
a pain in the ass.

45:12.810 --> 45:15.344
I think you like doing that.

45:15.346 --> 45:18.014
We're scaring fishermen
out of our favorite waters

45:18.016 --> 45:20.149
and attracting the media to...

45:20.151 --> 45:23.853
"Bigfoot sightings"
on crappy waters.

45:23.855 --> 45:25.855
<i>You're kidding?</i>

45:25.857 --> 45:30.026
Okay, scaring girls
into sex, stupid.

45:30.028 --> 45:31.994
Manipulating tourists,

45:31.996 --> 45:33.196
fuckin' brilliant.

45:35.399 --> 45:37.366
It's working, too.

45:37.368 --> 45:39.869
We were on the evening news
a couple of nights ago.

45:39.871 --> 45:41.204
We're really careful
who we choose.

45:41.206 --> 45:42.772
Mostly businessmen
from the front plains

45:42.774 --> 45:45.141
because they don't
want to look crazy.

45:45.143 --> 45:46.509
Kind of like pilots

45:46.511 --> 45:48.377
- not wanting to report UFO's.
- Yeah.

45:48.379 --> 45:50.046
And the news media assumes
lightning will strike

45:50.048 --> 45:52.248
the same place twice.
Exactly.

45:52.250 --> 45:54.016
You guys just might
be onto something.

45:54.018 --> 45:55.218
But we can dial this up a notch

45:55.220 --> 45:58.054
and really have some fun.

45:58.056 --> 45:59.756
How?

46:02.127 --> 46:05.161
<i>I'm just, you know,</i>
<i>wandering alone in the woods,</i>

46:05.163 --> 46:06.963
<i>by myself, late at night.</i>

46:08.833 --> 46:11.300
<i>Oh, my God!</i>
<i>There it is again!</i>

46:11.302 --> 46:13.302
<i>Oh, where is it?</i>

46:15.473 --> 46:17.006
<i>Where'd it go?</i>

46:17.008 --> 46:19.408
<i>Oh, my God! I can hear...</i>

46:19.410 --> 46:21.010
<i>where is it coming from?</i>

46:21.012 --> 46:23.146
<i>Oh, God, It's gonna kill me!</i>

46:23.148 --> 46:25.848
<i>I don't wanna die,</i>
<i>I haven't had sex yet!</i>

46:26.951 --> 46:28.317
<i>Oh, God.</i>

46:28.319 --> 46:29.819
<i>Did you see it?</i>

46:29.821 --> 46:31.320
<i>I hear something.</i>

46:31.322 --> 46:33.156
<i>Just got to be quiet.</i>

46:33.158 --> 46:34.791
<i>Just really quiet.</i>

46:34.793 --> 46:36.159
<i>Oh, God.</i>

46:36.161 --> 46:37.894
<i>No, no!</i>

46:37.896 --> 46:39.996
<i>Oh, my God, where is it?!</i>

46:39.998 --> 46:42.098
<i>I'm so scared.</i>

46:44.135 --> 46:45.535
That is awesome!

46:45.537 --> 46:47.170
Great work, Amy.

46:47.172 --> 46:49.138
Thanks.

46:49.140 --> 46:50.973
David?

46:50.975 --> 46:52.909
It's a little close to home.

46:52.911 --> 46:54.844
I just don't know
If we want to draw

46:54.846 --> 46:56.579
that much attention
to ourselves.

46:56.581 --> 46:58.381
Hey, you started
this little scam.

46:58.383 --> 47:00.216
I know, but YouTube?

47:00.218 --> 47:02.218
Don't be such a puss.

47:02.220 --> 47:03.319
Upload it.

47:03.321 --> 47:06.255
You're still
on probation, jackass.

47:06.257 --> 47:07.323
Rodney?

47:10.360 --> 47:11.494
It was nothing.
I was just being

47:11.496 --> 47:12.995
stupid and got caught.

47:12.997 --> 47:14.130
Forget it.

47:14.132 --> 47:15.598
Doing what?

47:18.169 --> 47:19.168
Joyriding.

47:19.170 --> 47:21.103
Oof, you are a dangerous,

47:21.105 --> 47:23.105
dangerous criminal.

47:23.107 --> 47:25.141
In art's patrol car,

47:25.143 --> 47:26.876
through the post office

47:26.878 --> 47:28.044
and into the river.

47:28.046 --> 47:29.912
<i>Oh, my God, really?</i>

47:29.914 --> 47:32.215
Yes.

47:32.217 --> 47:34.250
The other thing
he isn't telling you is

47:34.252 --> 47:37.486
that I was with him,
and he took all the heat

47:37.488 --> 47:40.623
even though that meant
he did a few years in jail.

47:40.625 --> 47:43.292
You were already 18,
bro, I was not, so...

47:43.294 --> 47:46.495
Plus, how was I supposed to know
they would try me as an adult?

47:46.497 --> 47:48.331
Yeah.

47:48.333 --> 47:52.368
Bro, we're not going
to get caught.

47:52.370 --> 47:54.270
Let's do this.

47:54.272 --> 47:55.605
David?

47:55.607 --> 47:57.173
C'mon!

47:57.175 --> 47:58.875
All right.

47:58.877 --> 48:01.143
Yes!

48:01.145 --> 48:03.346
And away it goes.

48:03.348 --> 48:05.481
We're gonna be
so fuckin' famous.

48:10.420 --> 48:11.554
<i>Okay, did you see that?</i>

48:11.556 --> 48:12.622
<i>Oh, God...</i>

48:12.624 --> 48:14.223
<i>That is what I saw.</i>

48:14.225 --> 48:15.591
<i>It scared</i>
<i>the living shit out of me,</i>

48:15.593 --> 48:19.161
<i>but obviously</i>
<i>It's some kind of hoax.</i>

48:19.163 --> 48:20.897
Holy shit.

48:20.899 --> 48:21.931
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

48:25.302 --> 48:27.303
David, wake up!

48:30.173 --> 48:32.174
David, wake up!

48:36.213 --> 48:37.613
What the hell's going on?

48:37.615 --> 48:39.615
I've been watching
the hits all night!

48:39.617 --> 48:41.083
What?
The YouTube hits!

48:41.085 --> 48:43.419
We're over 500,000
and rising fast!

48:43.421 --> 48:44.921
Oh, shit!

48:44.923 --> 48:46.689
What do you mean, "Oh, shit"?
This is awesome!

48:46.691 --> 48:48.691
Go, get your clothes on.
We've got work to do.

48:53.230 --> 48:55.264
Just give me one second.

49:06.977 --> 49:08.611
Okay. Oh, nice.

49:08.613 --> 49:10.012
New suit looks good, Rodney.

49:10.014 --> 49:11.514
Why, thank you.

49:11.516 --> 49:14.116
Okay, everyone,
synchronize your alarms

49:14.118 --> 49:17.053
for exactly five
minutes from now.

49:17.055 --> 49:18.454
Don't worry about it, Rodney,

49:18.456 --> 49:20.389
just take your cues
from David and Jen.

49:20.391 --> 49:21.958
I want you to work
your way upstream

49:21.960 --> 49:23.326
to that bend
and stay out of sight.

49:23.328 --> 49:25.227
I'm going to make my way
down to the news crew.

49:25.229 --> 49:27.363
David, cross the river
above that bend

49:27.365 --> 49:28.965
and then work your way half way

49:28.967 --> 49:30.633
between Rodney
and the news crew downstream.

49:30.635 --> 49:31.968
Stay hidden.

49:31.970 --> 49:33.602
I'm pretty sure this was

49:33.604 --> 49:35.104
my scam to start with.

49:35.106 --> 49:37.373
Well, we're dialing it
up a notch.

49:37.375 --> 49:41.344
So you've said.

49:41.346 --> 49:42.611
C'mon, let's go!

49:42.613 --> 49:45.081
This is gonna be
gonna be great.

49:55.092 --> 49:56.258
Okay, dude, medium shot

49:56.260 --> 49:57.693
then you pan over
to the river. Ready?

49:57.695 --> 49:59.729
Three, two, one.

49:59.731 --> 50:01.664
Horror in the high country

50:01.666 --> 50:03.766
where one name strikes fear

50:03.768 --> 50:05.668
in the hearts of
all the residents here

50:05.670 --> 50:07.536
on the South fork river.
Sweetheart!

50:07.538 --> 50:11.607
Where are you?

50:11.609 --> 50:15.311
I'm so lonely, sweety!
Cut, cut, cut.

50:15.313 --> 50:16.779
Where are you?!
Excuse me, miss, miss?

50:16.781 --> 50:18.714
Sweety? Hi, honey, listen.
Hi.

50:18.716 --> 50:20.149
We're working on
an important story.

50:20.151 --> 50:21.317
Just give me
a few minutes, okay?

50:21.319 --> 50:22.718
Oh...
Okay.

50:22.720 --> 50:24.053
Okay.
Keep going. Here we go.

50:24.055 --> 50:25.688
Three, two, one.

50:25.690 --> 50:27.490
Where just the name,
bigfoot, can strike...

50:27.492 --> 50:29.058
Sweety!

50:29.060 --> 50:30.259
<i>Cut.</i>
Honeybun!

50:30.261 --> 50:33.496
Sweetheart, lover,
where are you?

50:33.498 --> 50:36.699
Miss, miss, listen, we're doing
a bigfoot story, okay?

50:36.701 --> 50:38.501
Oh.
It's the story of the decade.

50:38.503 --> 50:40.269
And It's going to get me
out of this town, so...

50:40.271 --> 50:42.104
Okay, but I need
to talk to him, too.

50:42.106 --> 50:43.773
Well, we all do, honey.
It's, you know, what we do.

50:43.775 --> 50:45.508
But... so please just...
No, no, you see,

50:45.510 --> 50:47.176
I'm carryin' his baby,

50:47.178 --> 50:50.479
and I wanna surprise him
with the good news.

50:50.481 --> 50:52.548
Really?

50:52.550 --> 50:54.183
Roll it!
Honey, listen.

50:54.185 --> 50:55.451
Aren't you precious.
C'mon over here.

50:55.453 --> 50:56.619
Let's talk about this.

50:56.621 --> 50:59.088
And so what is your name,
princess?

50:59.090 --> 51:01.190
Oh, moon.

51:01.192 --> 51:02.525
Moon. Like, like...

51:02.527 --> 51:03.559
Like the moon?

51:03.561 --> 51:05.628
<i>Yeah, like the moon.</i>

51:05.630 --> 51:08.697
Okay, honey.
So, what exactly happened?

51:08.699 --> 51:12.768
Um, well, I don't usually
kiss and tell.

51:12.770 --> 51:14.570
Okay. But...
You know, let alone, you know.

51:14.572 --> 51:16.605
I know.
We talk about stuff like that.

51:16.607 --> 51:18.674
Here's what we need to do.
We're going to put you on TV

51:18.676 --> 51:20.709
so our nice TV audience
can hear what happened to you.

51:20.711 --> 51:22.378
Okay?
Oh, okay.

51:22.380 --> 51:23.712
You want to do that?
Oh, I will.

51:23.714 --> 51:25.181
I just didn't wanna ruin
the surprise but...

51:25.183 --> 51:26.649
No, I know,
but does he have a TV?

51:26.651 --> 51:28.250
I don't think so.
No, I guess not.

51:28.252 --> 51:30.453
You're right.
He doesn't have TV. Okay.

51:30.455 --> 51:32.154
Well, let's... let's...
you wanna go on TV?

51:32.156 --> 51:33.856
Okay, just act natural.
Sure. All right. Okay.

51:33.858 --> 51:35.357

Got some flies.

53:35.346 --> 53:37.346
Aw, man, It's about time.

53:37.348 --> 53:39.615
All these bigfoot sightings?
Thank you very much.

53:39.617 --> 53:41.450
People have been
swarming in here.

53:41.452 --> 53:42.685
What do you mean?

53:42.687 --> 53:43.919
I thought it would
be keeping people away,

but they are swarming in
like black flies.

53:45.389 --> 53:46.822
I'm low on everything.

53:46.824 --> 53:47.957
Speaking of the devil.

53:49.993 --> 53:51.894
What can I do for you
gentlemen today?

53:51.896 --> 53:54.496
We need to get equipped
for fishing.

53:54.498 --> 53:56.398
Cool, cool, is that clothes?

53:56.400 --> 53:57.900
Rods?
Everything.

53:57.902 --> 53:59.768
Everything it is. Let me
finish up with David here,

53:59.770 --> 54:01.837
and I'll get right to you guys.

54:01.839 --> 54:05.507
We saw you on the evening
news, Mr. Ottertale.

54:05.509 --> 54:07.443
How'd you...
how 'bout store credit, David?

54:10.580 --> 54:11.880
I kind of need the cash.

54:11.882 --> 54:13.415
I'll beat you up.

54:13.417 --> 54:15.351
For grandma.

54:15.353 --> 54:19.388
Man, that's low.
All right, for grandma.

54:19.390 --> 54:21.557
We hope to see bigfoot ourselves.
Mm-hmm.

54:21.559 --> 54:24.560
Yup, everybody wants
to see bigfoot.

54:24.562 --> 54:25.728
I'll get you guys all set up,

54:25.730 --> 54:27.896

go find him yourself.

54:27.898 --> 54:29.765
Thanks, David.
Keep 'em comin'.

54:29.767 --> 54:31.700
So, gentlemen,
fly-fishing

54:31.702 --> 54:33.936
is an art form in its truest sense.
But as with any art form...

54:33.938 --> 54:38.540
What would you recommend,
Mr. Ottertale?

54:38.542 --> 54:40.276
Rc's your man.

54:40.278 --> 54:41.644
See you around, David.

54:41.646 --> 54:42.911

<i>You won't believe</i>
<i>what's going on.</i>

It's my blog.

54:45.950 --> 54:47.483
What blog?

54:47.485 --> 54:50.719
The "I am having
bigfoot's baby" blog.

54:50.721 --> 54:52.288

54:54.425 --> 54:56.959
No more hairy man?

54:56.961 --> 54:59.895
"Bigfoot's baby blog" just sounded
better than "hairy man baby."

54:59.897 --> 55:02.331
And we have over
a million hits on YouTube.

55:02.333 --> 55:04.566
We're famous.
Oh, I love this one.

55:04.568 --> 55:07.069
"I have been abducted by aliens

55:48.012 --> 55:51.080
Copying bad ideas
off the Internet?

55:51.082 --> 55:53.349
The Internet is a great
source for inspiration.

55:53.351 --> 55:54.616

going to realize

wear wading boots.

55:56.554 --> 55:58.821
Whatever, you guys
go make your footprints.

grandma some fish.

56:01.459 --> 56:04.059
I thought you brought
her a bunch yesterday?

56:04.061 --> 56:06.462
Yeah, I don't know
what she is doing with them,

56:06.464 --> 56:10.132
but she is going through them
as quick as I can catch them.

56:10.134 --> 56:11.834
Can I come?

56:11.836 --> 56:14.036
Where?
Fishing.

56:14.038 --> 56:16.839
Oh, girl, you hate fishing.

56:16.841 --> 56:18.474
Let's go, hairy man.

56:20.377 --> 56:22.578
<i>Bigger steps. They can't</i>

<i>C'mon, let's go.</i>

<i>Bigger! Bigger!</i>

56:29.720 --> 56:31.086
<i>Yeah, that's it. Yeah.</i>

56:32.856 --> 56:34.423
Let's go catch some fish.

Hey! Look!

56:38.496 --> 56:39.495
Whoa.

56:39.497 --> 56:41.964
So much for fishing.

56:41.966 --> 56:44.633
Okay, that's cold.

56:47.871 --> 56:51.473
Wow, they say rocky
and Mountain,

56:51.475 --> 56:53.742
they really mean cold,
don't they?

56:53.744 --> 56:56.812
Wooo! Oh, shrinkage!

56:56.814 --> 56:58.013
Whoo.

56:58.015 --> 57:01.417
Whoa. Ha ha!

57:01.419 --> 57:04.620
I saw that picture of yours
on the news. Nice work.

57:04.622 --> 57:07.756
Thanks, but a professional
would know it wasn't very good.

57:07.758 --> 57:08.757
I kind of screwed up.

57:08.759 --> 57:12.895
Nah, you, you got the shot.

57:12.897 --> 57:15.130
I'm Jen.
Hey, I'm Charlie.

57:15.132 --> 57:16.698
Are you part of David's tribe?

57:16.700 --> 57:18.100
No, I'm from California.

57:18.102 --> 57:19.535
You're a photographer?

57:19.537 --> 57:21.603
We could be neighbors.

57:21.605 --> 57:23.739
I'm from orange county. O.C!

57:23.741 --> 57:25.441
O.C.!

57:25.443 --> 57:28.076
Actually, I've been
an accountant for 20 years,

57:28.078 --> 57:30.012
but as soon as I took
that first picture,

57:30.014 --> 57:31.480
I knew my true calling.

57:31.482 --> 57:33.949
So now I'm a wildlife
photographer.

57:33.951 --> 57:36.151
Good thing. You're just...
you're so sneaky.

57:36.153 --> 57:38.120
Thanks.

57:38.122 --> 57:39.922
I figured the hardest
animal to get

57:39.924 --> 57:41.523
is hairy man, bigfoot,

57:41.525 --> 57:43.225
whatever, so here I am.

57:43.227 --> 57:45.027
Here you are.

57:45.029 --> 57:46.495
You haven't seen
him today, have you?

57:46.497 --> 57:48.130
Not today.

57:48.132 --> 57:52.634
But there are some tracks
leading that way.

57:52.636 --> 57:54.470
Oh, hell! Thanks!

57:54.472 --> 57:56.472
Go get 'em, Charlie!

57:58.141 --> 58:00.843
Whoo! This is...

58:05.682 --> 58:06.782
<i>Hey!</i>

58:06.784 --> 58:09.017
Hey! How are the tracks?

58:09.019 --> 58:10.652
This guy with like five cameras

58:10.654 --> 58:12.554
actually started following us.

58:12.556 --> 58:13.989
We led him in circles
for over an hour.

58:13.991 --> 58:15.624
We finally had to cross
the river a few times

58:15.626 --> 58:17.559
and then double back
just to get away from him.

58:17.561 --> 58:19.595
Charlie.
What?

58:19.597 --> 58:22.164
He's the guy who took that first
photo that ended up everywhere.

58:22.166 --> 58:24.099
That's too funny!

58:26.536 --> 58:29.638
Hey.
How was the fishin'?

58:29.640 --> 58:31.039
We caught a lot of fish.

58:31.041 --> 58:32.241
Really?

59:01.671 --> 59:02.671
Whew.

59:05.842 --> 59:07.910
And the game
just got interesting.

59:11.214 --> 59:12.748
That was them.

59:12.750 --> 59:13.916
Obviously.

59:34.270 --> 59:36.939
So, what do you want to do?

59:36.941 --> 59:38.840
I'm going to go check
on grandma.

59:38.842 --> 59:40.208
Grandma's fine.

59:40.210 --> 59:41.710
It's going to be
a full moon tonight,

59:41.712 --> 59:44.012
and I'm feeling
kind of romantic.

59:44.014 --> 59:45.781
That's a really
great offer but...

59:45.783 --> 59:47.316
Hey, guys. What's up?

59:47.318 --> 59:48.750
Hey.

59:48.752 --> 59:51.353
We went fishing
this afternoon. You?

59:51.355 --> 59:54.022
Oh. We made arrangements

59:54.024 --> 59:55.290
to dial it up another notch.

59:55.292 --> 59:56.592
Yeah, baby!

59:56.594 --> 59:58.327
We are going to fake

59:58.329 --> 01:00:00.596
a ufo landing!
What?!

01:00:00.598 --> 01:00:03.098
Rodney and I bought a bunch of
weather balloons, some helium,

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:04.633
a couple of remote
control units,

01:00:04.635 --> 01:00:06.068
and some color
changing I.E.D. Lights.

01:00:06.070 --> 01:00:07.135
We're going to float them

01:00:07.137 --> 01:00:08.604
in that clearing
outside of town

01:00:08.606 --> 01:00:10.806
and scare the crap
out of everyone!

01:00:10.808 --> 01:00:13.141
It'll be the perfect finale
to our YouTube series!

01:00:13.143 --> 01:00:16.211
Amy, how did you pay
for all this ufo stuff?

01:00:16.213 --> 01:00:18.213
I used your credit card.
What else is new?

01:00:18.215 --> 01:00:21.283
And how much
did everything cost?

01:00:21.285 --> 01:00:23.352
Slightly under 10 k.

01:00:23.354 --> 01:00:24.820
Jen's loaded, bra.

01:00:24.822 --> 01:00:26.655
God damn it! We've
talked about this!

01:00:26.657 --> 01:00:29.191
I have no problem
paying for our living supplies!

01:00:29.193 --> 01:00:32.127
But $10,000 on toys?
What the frik!

01:00:32.129 --> 01:00:33.829
Share and share alike, right?

01:00:33.831 --> 01:00:35.163
Besides you're just
as into this as I am.

01:00:35.165 --> 01:00:36.365
You paid for
the new hairy man suit.

01:00:36.367 --> 01:00:37.866
No, I'm not.

01:00:37.868 --> 01:00:39.935
It has been fun,
but a couple hundred bucks

01:00:39.937 --> 01:00:42.137
is a hell of a lot different
than 10,000 fucking dollars!

01:00:42.139 --> 01:00:44.172
Slightly less than
10,000 fucking dollars!

01:00:44.174 --> 01:00:46.008
And since when
did you give a shit?

01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:48.210
Since I have a boyfriend and
started discovering my roots,

01:00:48.212 --> 01:00:50.646
that's since when!
I am not...

01:00:50.648 --> 01:00:52.180
Shut up, David!
You tell him, baby!

01:00:52.182 --> 01:00:54.016
Fuck you, Rodney!
Well, take it easy, buddy.

01:00:54.018 --> 01:00:56.018
Obviously I'm going
to side with my girlfriend.

01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:57.686
And who do you think
is your girlfriend?!

01:00:57.688 --> 01:00:58.854
You.
Oh, no, dude,

01:00:58.856 --> 01:01:00.322
I am so not your girlfriend.

01:01:00.324 --> 01:01:02.257
Okay, I want you to leave

01:01:02.259 --> 01:01:04.359
so that I can
be alone with David

01:01:04.361 --> 01:01:05.761
so we can talk about this.

01:01:05.763 --> 01:01:06.895
You want me to leave?
Yes!

01:01:06.897 --> 01:01:08.664
Fine!
No, no don't leave.

01:01:08.666 --> 01:01:10.866
Why not, bro? Your girly friend
is being a bitch to mine.

01:01:10.868 --> 01:01:12.868
She is not my girlfriend!
I am not your girlfriend!

01:01:16.873 --> 01:01:18.974
Well, I haven't been
standing out

01:01:18.976 --> 01:01:21.109
in that river with you
because I wanted to be cold

01:01:21.111 --> 01:01:23.679
and wet and covered with fish!

01:01:23.681 --> 01:01:27.049
And I sure as hell haven't been driving
you around all day because I wanted to!

01:01:28.785 --> 01:01:31.119
What the hell was that?

01:01:35.825 --> 01:01:37.292
Do you guys smell fish?

01:01:37.294 --> 01:01:39.761
I have been smelling fish
for a week now.

01:01:39.763 --> 01:01:41.897
Not like that.
I mean like stale fish.

01:01:45.969 --> 01:01:48.370
Ah,

01:01:48.372 --> 01:01:52.174
Jesus, you're a branch.

01:01:52.176 --> 01:01:54.776
You're a branch.

01:01:54.778 --> 01:01:55.977
Ow! Prickly!

01:02:15.431 --> 01:02:19.301
Grandma, this is Amy and Jen.
Hello.

01:02:19.303 --> 01:02:20.836
Hello.
Hello.

01:02:20.838 --> 01:02:22.771
Hello, grandma Ottertale.

01:02:22.773 --> 01:02:24.773
Hello, Rodney.

01:02:26.876 --> 01:02:28.210
Did you bring any fish?

01:02:28.212 --> 01:02:30.212
Hairy man likes fish.

01:02:30.214 --> 01:02:31.446
Yes, we discovered that.

01:02:31.448 --> 01:02:32.881
That's why we're here.

01:02:32.883 --> 01:02:34.382
Would you like some cookies?

01:02:34.384 --> 01:02:37.819
Oh, no, thank you.

01:02:37.821 --> 01:02:39.387
We don't have any anyway.

01:02:39.389 --> 01:02:42.524
But white people like cookies.

01:02:42.526 --> 01:02:46.328
Thanks, grandma.

01:02:46.330 --> 01:02:49.364
We're here to talk about
the orbs and hairy man.

01:02:49.366 --> 01:02:51.266
Are they aliens?

01:02:51.268 --> 01:02:52.834
Are the orbs
and hairy man together?

01:02:52.836 --> 01:02:54.336
Or do they just coincide
with each other?

01:02:54.338 --> 01:02:56.371
Where are you from?

01:02:56.373 --> 01:02:57.506
California.

01:02:57.508 --> 01:02:59.141
That makes sense.

01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:04.212
Grandma, we saw hairy man.

01:03:04.214 --> 01:03:05.814
And it scared
the crap out of us.

01:03:05.816 --> 01:03:07.916
Why?

01:03:07.918 --> 01:03:12.053
Well, a three-fingered creature
just came and took our fish.

01:03:12.055 --> 01:03:13.088
He likes fish.

01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:14.422
Yes, we gathered that.

01:03:14.424 --> 01:03:16.224
We just want to know what he is

01:03:16.226 --> 01:03:17.926
and where he came from.

01:03:17.928 --> 01:03:19.227
Why?

01:03:19.229 --> 01:03:20.862
Grandma Ottertale...

01:03:20.864 --> 01:03:23.265
Please, call me Louise.

01:03:23.267 --> 01:03:25.534
Why the fuck do they
always call me grandma?

01:03:25.536 --> 01:03:28.103
I'm only 55.

01:03:28.105 --> 01:03:29.437
Sorry, grandma.

01:03:29.439 --> 01:03:31.940
Okay, Louise, It's just...

01:03:31.942 --> 01:03:34.442
It's important because it calls
so many things into play.

01:03:34.444 --> 01:03:36.578
Like, where are we from,
why are we here?

01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:38.847
Knowing some of those answers
would help us understand

01:03:38.849 --> 01:03:40.348
our place in the universe.

01:03:40.350 --> 01:03:42.984
Amy's got her degree
in philosophy.

01:03:42.986 --> 01:03:44.452
Oh, that's too bad.

01:03:46.023 --> 01:03:47.956
See those geese?

01:03:50.259 --> 01:03:51.960
Do you ever wonder
why there's more

01:03:51.962 --> 01:03:54.996
on the right side
than the left side?

01:03:58.568 --> 01:04:02.170
It's because more geese
decided to fly on that side

01:04:02.172 --> 01:04:03.872
than the other side.

01:04:05.541 --> 01:04:07.576
I'm sorry.
I don't follow you.

01:04:07.578 --> 01:04:10.212
You're looking too hard.

01:04:10.214 --> 01:04:13.315
Okay. There must be a reason
why all this is happening.

01:04:13.317 --> 01:04:15.350
He's just fishing.

01:04:15.352 --> 01:04:16.418
What?

01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:18.954
It's good fishing here.

01:04:18.956 --> 01:04:20.956
Oh, my God.

01:04:20.958 --> 01:04:23.925
He's a tourist?

01:04:23.927 --> 01:04:25.193
It's like all
the weekend warriors

01:04:25.195 --> 01:04:26.494
in David and Rodney's
fishing holes.

01:04:26.496 --> 01:04:28.129
He's here to fish, and he wants

01:04:28.131 --> 01:04:30.398
to avoid the locals
as much as possible.

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:32.934
They've been coming
a long time.

01:04:32.936 --> 01:04:36.071
Well, how long?
A long time.

01:04:36.073 --> 01:04:39.341
I'm gonna take some fish to him
tonight If you wanna ask him.

01:04:39.343 --> 01:04:43.078
But he doesn't talk.

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:45.914
Why are you taking
an alien fisherman fish?

01:04:45.916 --> 01:04:48.917
I don't think this one's
very good at it.

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:05.901
Oh, Louise, that's our home.

01:05:05.903 --> 01:05:07.402
Uh-huh,
you're neighbors.

01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:10.071
That's the den right there.

01:05:10.073 --> 01:05:11.406
We live next to hairy man?

01:05:11.408 --> 01:05:13.074
I guess so.

01:05:22.151 --> 01:05:23.218
Is he in there?

01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:24.519
He's shy.

01:05:24.521 --> 01:05:27.555
I'll go up first
so he knows It's okay.

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:40.101
I hope you caught fish today.

01:05:40.103 --> 01:05:42.570
But I brought some more
just in case you didn't.

01:05:42.572 --> 01:05:44.973
I brought some friends
with me, too.

01:05:52.114 --> 01:05:55.350
This is my grandson, David.

01:05:55.352 --> 01:05:56.451
Hello.

01:05:56.453 --> 01:05:58.320
And his friend, Rodney.

01:05:58.322 --> 01:05:59.621
What's up, hairy man?

01:05:59.623 --> 01:06:02.557
And their girlfriends,
Jen and Amy.

01:06:02.559 --> 01:06:04.159
Oh, we're not
their girlfriends.

01:06:04.161 --> 01:06:05.393
We thought we'd come by

01:06:05.395 --> 01:06:07.128
and welcome you
to the neighborhood.

01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:08.697
Jen and I live
next door, I guess.

01:06:08.699 --> 01:06:10.398
You were at our home earlier.

01:06:13.002 --> 01:06:14.002
May I?

01:06:14.004 --> 01:06:15.236
Sure.

01:06:19.475 --> 01:06:20.575
I can't see him.

01:06:20.577 --> 01:06:21.977
He's shy.

01:06:25.281 --> 01:06:26.715
Hairy man's a girl.

01:06:26.717 --> 01:06:29.250
Hairy girl?

01:06:29.252 --> 01:06:33.188
Oh, I don't know.

01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:34.489
She could be.

01:06:34.491 --> 01:06:37.993
She's a lot bigger than
most of them.

01:06:37.995 --> 01:06:39.294
How did you know that?

01:06:39.296 --> 01:06:41.529
I don't know.
It popped into my head.

01:06:41.531 --> 01:06:44.032
Must be some sort
of alien pheromone.

01:06:44.034 --> 01:06:46.701
There's a lot of pheromone
around here tonight.

01:06:51.641 --> 01:06:53.475
<i>I don't like this.</i>

01:06:53.477 --> 01:06:55.210
What's up?!

01:06:55.212 --> 01:06:56.244
Get down!

01:06:56.246 --> 01:06:57.512
<i>Ow!</i>

01:06:57.514 --> 01:06:59.314
It's a blackhawk.

01:06:59.316 --> 01:07:01.449
If he's out here this late,
he's looking for something.

01:07:01.451 --> 01:07:03.418
They've got night vision,
forward-looking infrared,

01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:06.187
and a whole bunch of other stuff
you don't even want to know about.

01:07:06.189 --> 01:07:09.357
I just hope they didn't see
the light coming out of the den.

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:11.292
How the hell
do you know all that?

01:07:11.294 --> 01:07:12.494
I grew up in Germany

01:07:12.496 --> 01:07:15.130
at the army's helicopter
command hq.

01:07:15.132 --> 01:07:17.532
Yeah, a lot of hippie chicks
on military bases, right?

01:07:17.534 --> 01:07:19.367
I'm not big on authority.

01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:21.369
Why are we hiding?

01:07:21.371 --> 01:07:24.172
Who's been making all
the headlines?

01:07:24.174 --> 01:07:25.573
Us!

01:07:25.575 --> 01:07:30.445
We just led the military
to hairy girl by accident.

01:07:30.447 --> 01:07:31.713
She's alone.

01:07:31.715 --> 01:07:32.814
All she could do is hide

01:07:32.816 --> 01:07:35.617
If they come looking for her.

01:07:35.619 --> 01:07:37.118
She was dropped off.

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:39.254
She has to wait
for her friends.

01:07:39.256 --> 01:07:42.190
I'm afraid they won't come If
they're being chased by the army.

01:07:46.328 --> 01:07:48.196
<i>And the search continues</i>
<i>for a city man,</i>

01:07:48.198 --> 01:07:49.798
<i>- Charlie Murphy.</i>
- Yeah.

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:52.167
<i>Friends say after</i>
<i>purchasing a new camera...</i>

01:07:52.169 --> 01:07:54.235
Uh-huh.
<i>- ...He had become obsessed</i>

01:07:54.237 --> 01:07:56.171
<i>with photographing the elusive</i>

01:07:56.173 --> 01:07:57.472
<i>bigfoot of South fork.</i>

01:07:57.474 --> 01:07:59.107
<i>When I was taking courses</i>

01:07:59.109 --> 01:08:01.109
<i>at the Arapahonsuit</i>
<i>Community College,</i>

01:08:01.111 --> 01:08:03.678
<i>my Professor told me there</i>
<i>that the thing you need to do</i>

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:06.114
<i>is find your composition,</i>
<i>fix your lens</i>

01:08:06.116 --> 01:08:09.150
<i>and then everything else happens
in photoshoping afterwards.</i>

01:08:09.152 --> 01:08:11.286
And why haven't
you arrested them?

01:08:11.288 --> 01:08:13.388
<i>To fly search and rescue
operations day and night...</i>

01:08:13.390 --> 01:08:15.290
No, no. Listen.
I'll tell you why.

01:08:15.292 --> 01:08:17.425
Because some of these
stupid sons a bitches

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:19.661
are getting lost in the woods
trying to find this hoax,

01:08:19.662 --> 01:08:22.296
that's why!

01:08:22.299 --> 01:08:23.631
How are you doing?

01:08:23.633 --> 01:08:25.433
<i>Friends are very concerned.</i>

01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:28.269
<i>He has very little experience</i>
<i>in the wilderness,</i>

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:30.772
<i>barely knew how</i>
<i>to operate his new camera,</i>

01:08:30.774 --> 01:08:32.774
<i>and they hope</i>
<i>he had not been drinking.</i>

01:08:32.776 --> 01:08:34.442
Fine, then We'll set up a sting

01:08:34.444 --> 01:08:36.310
and catch them in the act,

01:08:36.313 --> 01:08:39.747
whatever you FBI guys do.

01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:42.117
Of course I'll participate!

01:08:50.192 --> 01:08:51.225
Knock, knock.

01:08:52.461 --> 01:08:54.362
Go away, Rodney.

01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:55.563
Don't be such a bitch.

01:08:55.564 --> 01:08:56.564
Come on in, Rodney.

01:09:00.769 --> 01:09:02.504
Mind If we talk?

01:09:02.506 --> 01:09:03.571
About what?

01:09:03.573 --> 01:09:06.207
About you being a tease.

01:09:06.209 --> 01:09:07.375
Piss off, Rodney.

01:09:07.377 --> 01:09:08.609
He doesn't deserve that.

01:09:08.612 --> 01:09:10.545
You are a tease.

01:09:10.546 --> 01:09:12.412
I'm a tease?

01:09:12.415 --> 01:09:14.482
Yeah, you are.

01:09:14.484 --> 01:09:17.285
I see. Well, I guess that's
better than being delusional.

01:09:17.287 --> 01:09:19.821
Who are you talking to?

01:09:19.823 --> 01:09:21.689
Both of you.

01:09:21.691 --> 01:09:23.691
You for thinking that
you stood a chance with me,

01:09:23.693 --> 01:09:26.493
and you for thinking that
you stood a chance with David.

01:09:26.496 --> 01:09:30.365
Oh, come on, you know damn
well you'd be lucky to have me.

01:09:32.201 --> 01:09:34.202
You're perfect for each other.

01:09:52.421 --> 01:09:53.787
Oh, Amy.

01:09:53.790 --> 01:09:55.924
Louise.

01:09:55.926 --> 01:09:57.892
I'm sorry,
I was looking for David.

01:09:57.894 --> 01:10:00.862
Um, he's in his room.

01:10:00.864 --> 01:10:02.597
Do you mind If I come in?

01:10:02.599 --> 01:10:04.866
No, no, no, come on in.

01:10:08.304 --> 01:10:09.871
Cookies?

01:10:09.873 --> 01:10:11.906
Oh, no, thanks.

01:10:11.908 --> 01:10:13.374
I'm sorry, where is he?

01:10:13.376 --> 01:10:14.542
Upstairs.

01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:15.610
Thanks.

01:10:18.247 --> 01:10:19.247
David?

01:10:22.251 --> 01:10:24.485
Amy. What's up?

01:10:24.487 --> 01:10:26.387
Rodney came by
to call me a tease

01:10:26.389 --> 01:10:28.289
and then Jen joined in and
called me a tease, so I left

01:10:28.291 --> 01:10:29.691
and now I'm pissed off
because I'm not a tease,

01:10:29.693 --> 01:10:32.393
and I should have
made them both apologize.

01:10:32.395 --> 01:10:33.494
Why are you smiling?

01:10:33.496 --> 01:10:35.997
Well, you-you are a tease.

01:10:35.999 --> 01:10:37.865
You jerk.

01:10:37.867 --> 01:10:39.901
Look, I came here...

01:10:43.939 --> 01:10:46.975
I know. I can't help it.

01:10:46.977 --> 01:10:48.509
It's cool.

01:10:48.511 --> 01:10:49.611
I kind of like it.

01:10:49.613 --> 01:10:51.012
Really?

01:10:51.014 --> 01:10:53.848
Yeah, It's... Kind of hot.

01:11:03.292 --> 01:11:04.726
Yes.

01:11:18.807 --> 01:11:20.575
What a civilian.

01:11:23.479 --> 01:11:24.846
What is he doing?

01:11:29.585 --> 01:11:31.019
I don't believe it.

01:11:31.021 --> 01:11:33.321
<i>The stupid son of a bitch</i>
<i>is here.</i>

01:11:34.657 --> 01:11:36.057
He's pointing at something.

01:11:36.059 --> 01:11:37.425
Do you see anything?

01:11:37.427 --> 01:11:38.693
Nothing that I can see.

01:11:51.006 --> 01:11:52.707
Stinks down here.

01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:54.709
What the hell is he doing?

01:11:54.711 --> 01:11:57.512
<i>He's sneaking up on something.</i>

01:11:57.514 --> 01:11:59.781
<i>Is the camera rolling?</i>

01:11:59.783 --> 01:12:00.915
Of course.

01:12:08.957 --> 01:12:10.491
Gotcha!

01:12:24.341 --> 01:12:25.606
Jesus Christ!

01:12:25.608 --> 01:12:27.642
<i>What?!</i>

01:12:27.644 --> 01:12:28.943
What the hell is it?!

01:12:28.945 --> 01:12:30.812
Some sort of...
some sort of creature.

01:12:30.814 --> 01:12:32.447
I've never seen
anything like it before.

01:12:32.449 --> 01:12:34.615
It just vanished.
What do you mean vanished?!

01:12:34.617 --> 01:12:35.983
I mean, I had it in frame,

01:12:35.985 --> 01:12:37.985
there was this weird flash
and it vanished.

01:12:37.987 --> 01:12:39.487
That sounds like a cloak.

01:12:39.489 --> 01:12:40.488
Let me see that.

01:12:42.959 --> 01:12:44.492
See it?

01:12:49.365 --> 01:12:53.935
You pressed off instead of on.

01:12:53.937 --> 01:12:55.903
God damn it.

01:12:55.905 --> 01:12:57.138
We've got 40 minutes

01:12:57.140 --> 01:12:59.540
of bill fucking fishing

01:12:59.542 --> 01:13:02.043
and no evidence.

01:13:02.045 --> 01:13:03.911
You asshole!

01:13:16.492 --> 01:13:19.160
Streams all lead
to civilization.

01:13:22.898 --> 01:13:25.900
Why can't I find civilization?

01:13:31.006 --> 01:13:33.441
I got you. I got you.
I got you.

01:13:33.443 --> 01:13:35.543
Come on.

01:13:35.545 --> 01:13:36.677
Come on. I got it.

01:13:44.186 --> 01:13:45.453
I got it.

01:13:46.855 --> 01:13:49.123
I got it!

01:13:49.125 --> 01:13:51.159
Whoa, something's going on.

01:13:52.761 --> 01:13:54.896
I'm going to check it out.

01:13:54.898 --> 01:13:56.731
Oh, please don't, fuzzy bear.
Relax.

01:13:56.733 --> 01:13:59.033
What have we been doing
for the past two hours?

01:13:59.035 --> 01:14:01.102
Having crazy sex, sugar plum.

01:14:01.104 --> 01:14:02.970
So we have an alibi.

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:13.714
Hey, art. You know,
I would still

01:14:13.716 --> 01:14:15.583
love to drive
that new car of yours.

01:14:15.585 --> 01:14:17.718
Mr. jobs, so nice
of you to show up.

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:19.086
You!

01:14:19.088 --> 01:14:20.988
Bill's had another
bigfoot sighting.

01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:23.224
I was sure you and your little
buddy were fucking with me.

01:14:23.226 --> 01:14:26.194
In the news, every time
there was a sighting,

01:14:26.196 --> 01:14:28.996
but hairy man, is fucking real!

01:14:28.998 --> 01:14:30.998
That's what I told you, man!

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.967
He just scared
the shit out of me,

01:14:32.969 --> 01:14:34.135
and there's no fucking way

01:14:34.137 --> 01:14:36.671
that was a punk-ass kid
in a suit.

01:14:36.673 --> 01:14:38.673
Who are those two
wankers over there?

01:14:38.675 --> 01:14:40.708
<i>Claim to be FBI.</i>

01:14:40.710 --> 01:14:43.511
Huh, well, cool.

01:14:43.513 --> 01:14:45.179
Good luck, bill.
You're gonna make it.

01:14:45.181 --> 01:14:47.515
People! Hey!

01:14:47.517 --> 01:14:49.217
I got a picture of hairy man!

01:14:49.219 --> 01:14:53.187
<i>Hey, hey, I got a</i>
<i>picture of my hairy man!</i>

01:14:53.189 --> 01:14:55.656
I'm a real goddamn
wildlife photographer!

01:14:55.658 --> 01:14:57.158
Let me see it!

01:15:00.796 --> 01:15:01.796
I don't see anything.

01:15:02.998 --> 01:15:04.265
Oh, my God, FBI?

01:15:04.267 --> 01:15:05.867
Shit.

01:15:05.869 --> 01:15:08.035
Think we're in trouble?
Oh, I know we're in trouble.

01:15:08.037 --> 01:15:09.203
I just don't know how much.

01:15:09.205 --> 01:15:10.905
We got to find David.

01:15:12.808 --> 01:15:15.009
Oh, hold on, it must have
just run out of batteries.

01:15:15.011 --> 01:15:17.812
Oh, wait. No, shit.

01:15:17.814 --> 01:15:19.680
Oh, shit, that was my last one.

01:15:19.682 --> 01:15:22.617
God damn it!

01:15:22.619 --> 01:15:25.786
Where'd you get those pants?
Those are awesome.

01:15:25.788 --> 01:15:28.523
I could really do some hiding
in the wild with those.

01:15:28.525 --> 01:15:29.924
What size are you?

01:15:39.134 --> 01:15:40.701
Hi, Louise.

01:15:40.703 --> 01:15:42.270
Hi.

01:15:43.972 --> 01:15:45.706
Hey, grandma, David around?

01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:48.976
Him and Amy are upstairs
making noise.

01:15:48.978 --> 01:15:51.078
Oh, really?

01:15:53.015 --> 01:15:55.016
Out of bed, asshole!

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:01.656
Hey, guys. What's up?

01:16:03.659 --> 01:16:05.326
Are you up there
banging my girlfriend?

01:16:09.031 --> 01:16:10.631
Come on out, Amy.

01:16:10.633 --> 01:16:12.066
<i>We hooked up, too.</i>

01:16:12.068 --> 01:16:13.901
Nice!

01:16:13.903 --> 01:16:16.270
But seriously, get dressed,
we've got a problem.

01:16:27.916 --> 01:16:29.116
What's up?

01:16:29.118 --> 01:16:32.653
You guys cut it way
too close this time.

01:16:32.655 --> 01:16:33.955
What are you talking about?

01:16:33.957 --> 01:16:35.756
We just left the landing,

01:16:35.758 --> 01:16:37.959
and the same guy that
we scared a couple weeks ago

01:16:37.961 --> 01:16:39.126
was lying on his back

01:16:39.128 --> 01:16:40.795
rambling about
hairy man to art.

01:16:40.797 --> 01:16:43.064
Ring a bell?
What?

01:16:43.066 --> 01:16:44.231
Yeah, the two FBI guys

01:16:44.233 --> 01:16:46.267
and Charlie were there as well.

01:16:46.269 --> 01:16:49.070
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:16:49.072 --> 01:16:51.272
You guys obviously
pulled a scam without us,

01:16:51.274 --> 01:16:53.374
and you got way
too close this time.

01:16:53.376 --> 01:16:56.310
We've been inside
for at least...

01:16:56.312 --> 01:16:58.312
Two hours.

01:16:58.314 --> 01:17:00.615
Shit, you don't think...

01:17:00.617 --> 01:17:03.084
I think they saw
our little friend for real.

01:17:03.086 --> 01:17:04.218
We got to go check on her.

01:17:07.923 --> 01:17:09.657
Where are you going?

01:17:09.659 --> 01:17:11.859
We're going to her den
to make sure she's all right.

01:17:11.861 --> 01:17:14.395
She's leaving tonight.
It's the full moon.

01:17:14.397 --> 01:17:15.930
How do you know that?

01:17:15.932 --> 01:17:18.099
They always leave
on the full moon.

01:17:18.101 --> 01:17:19.700
Is she all right?

01:17:19.702 --> 01:17:21.769
She's scared,
what do you think?

01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:25.072
Where the fuck are you going?!

01:17:27.743 --> 01:17:29.176
To her den, grandma.

01:17:29.178 --> 01:17:30.911
She's not there.

01:17:30.913 --> 01:17:32.213
How do you know that?

01:17:32.215 --> 01:17:33.714
She's right here.

01:17:33.716 --> 01:17:36.684
Shit, would I be sitting
here for nothing?

01:17:36.686 --> 01:17:38.052
I'm just sitting here
trying to chill

01:17:38.054 --> 01:17:39.787
with her, you know?

01:17:45.994 --> 01:17:47.995
Do you have any more fish?

01:17:49.331 --> 01:17:50.998
She's hungry.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:54.969
Yep, I think she's
a stress eater.

01:17:56.171 --> 01:17:57.872
Oh, company.

01:18:01.710 --> 01:18:02.743
Nice car, art.

01:18:02.745 --> 01:18:04.145
Not now, Rodney.

01:18:05.747 --> 01:18:07.748
Need any help?

01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:09.316
No, thanks.
Just a raccoon.

01:18:11.019 --> 01:18:13.888
Sounds like a big one.

01:18:13.890 --> 01:18:17.258
If you all are thinking about
getting into any more trouble,

01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:18.726
I wouldn't.

01:18:18.728 --> 01:18:20.061
What do you mean?

01:18:20.063 --> 01:18:21.062
<i>Hey, art?</i>

01:18:21.064 --> 01:18:23.130
Oh, nothing really.

01:18:23.132 --> 01:18:25.466
It's just that I thought
you should know

01:18:25.468 --> 01:18:27.301
there's a lot of feds around

01:18:27.303 --> 01:18:29.403
asking a lot of questions
about you four.

01:18:29.405 --> 01:18:30.805
<i>Hey, art.</i>

01:18:30.807 --> 01:18:33.207
Huh, that's weird.
I wonder why?

01:18:33.209 --> 01:18:36.477
<i>The army and those two FBI guys</i>
<i>are asking for you.</i>

01:18:36.479 --> 01:18:38.145
Yeah, I wonder why.

01:18:38.147 --> 01:18:40.748
Looks like the cavalry's here.

01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:43.217
They're staging something
at the high school.

01:18:43.219 --> 01:18:45.786
I got to go over and make sure
everybody behaves.

01:18:45.788 --> 01:18:47.221
<i>Hey, art,</i>
<i>where the hell are you?</i>

01:18:47.223 --> 01:18:48.923
Be good.

01:18:54.996 --> 01:18:57.231
Drive safe.

01:18:57.233 --> 01:18:58.766
Shit, what the hell
are we gonna do?

01:18:58.768 --> 01:19:00.067
We've got hairy girl
under the porch

01:19:00.069 --> 01:19:01.969
and cops everywhere.

01:19:01.971 --> 01:19:04.071
She has to leave tonight.

01:19:04.073 --> 01:19:05.239
Where does she need to be?

01:19:05.241 --> 01:19:07.208
At her campsite.

01:19:07.210 --> 01:19:09.977
What? So, we have the cops,

01:19:09.979 --> 01:19:12.880
the feds,
and apparently the army

01:19:12.882 --> 01:19:14.482
between us
and where she needs to go.

01:19:14.484 --> 01:19:16.217
Great.

01:19:16.219 --> 01:19:17.885
We need a diversion.

01:19:17.887 --> 01:19:19.420
What we need is not to draw

01:19:19.422 --> 01:19:21.188
any more attention
to ourselves.

01:19:21.190 --> 01:19:22.523
No, If we give them
what they're looking for,

01:19:22.525 --> 01:19:24.525
they won't stumble on
her by mistake.

01:19:24.527 --> 01:19:26.060
We'll put on
the fake ufo landing

01:19:26.062 --> 01:19:28.062
like Rodney and I planned.

01:19:28.064 --> 01:19:31.365
So, you wanna lure them
to a hoax on tribal land?

01:19:31.367 --> 01:19:33.868
We'll have to give
them bigfoot as well, Rodney.

01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:36.170
This isn't a bunch
of fucking tourists anymore.

01:19:36.172 --> 01:19:38.305
I really don't want
to go back to jail.

01:19:38.307 --> 01:19:39.874
Or get shot.
Yeah.

01:19:39.876 --> 01:19:41.876
Okay, fine.
I will wear the suit.

01:19:41.878 --> 01:19:44.078
Damn, you guys are such wusses.

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:45.379
I wear the suit around here.

01:19:45.381 --> 01:19:46.947
I will do it.
No, you're not.

01:19:46.949 --> 01:19:48.215
It's a bad idea.

01:19:48.217 --> 01:19:49.784
Luring the feds
and the army cavalry

01:19:49.786 --> 01:19:51.452
to tribal ground
is not an option.

01:19:51.454 --> 01:19:54.922
Last time it happened
around here, it ended badly.

01:19:54.924 --> 01:19:57.525
Rodney, get dressed
and run around town.

01:19:57.527 --> 01:19:59.226
The rest of us will send up
the lights and balloons

01:19:59.228 --> 01:20:01.162
as soon as you can
hide and text us.

01:20:01.164 --> 01:20:03.364
They'll see our ufo, and They'll
all come up to the clearing.

01:20:03.366 --> 01:20:04.532
I'm telling you no.

01:20:04.534 --> 01:20:06.433
Relax, chief.

01:20:06.435 --> 01:20:08.435
I'm an army brat, so the worst
They'll do is call my father

01:20:08.437 --> 01:20:10.371
and the joint chiefs
or something.

01:20:10.373 --> 01:20:12.139
Everybody else can hide.

01:20:12.141 --> 01:20:13.808
What?

01:20:13.810 --> 01:20:15.075
You're fucking out of line!

01:20:15.077 --> 01:20:17.011
And this never
should have happened!

01:20:17.013 --> 01:20:18.279
Excuse me?

01:20:18.281 --> 01:20:20.314
I had this nice
little scam going on

01:20:20.316 --> 01:20:22.116
until you tourists got involved

01:20:22.118 --> 01:20:23.117
and blew the whole thing up

01:20:23.119 --> 01:20:24.351
with your YouTube videos

01:20:24.353 --> 01:20:26.120
and your bigfoot baby crap!

01:20:26.122 --> 01:20:27.955
So this is my fault?

01:20:27.957 --> 01:20:29.990
Mostly yours and Jen's.

01:20:29.992 --> 01:20:31.025
Oh, hold on, I didn't want...

01:20:31.027 --> 01:20:32.827
Shut the hell up, Jen!

01:20:32.829 --> 01:20:34.562
Relax, okay?
Just relax.

01:20:34.564 --> 01:20:36.497
It's an accident.
All of us are in on it.

01:20:36.499 --> 01:20:38.032
We just have to fix it,
It's fine.

01:20:38.034 --> 01:20:39.533
Rodney, fuck you, too!

01:20:39.535 --> 01:20:41.268
You're just as much
of a tourist as they are!

01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:43.604
Bro, remember
when I live 5 minutes

01:20:43.606 --> 01:20:45.339
down the road from you and
I've seen you every single day

01:20:45.341 --> 01:20:47.041
since we were 6 years old.
You're scaring her.

01:20:47.043 --> 01:20:48.409
You've been squatting
on tribal land

01:20:48.411 --> 01:20:50.110
longer than they have!
So what?!

01:20:50.112 --> 01:20:51.946
Squatting?
Enough!

01:20:51.948 --> 01:20:53.881
Okay, I'm sorry
you don't like it,

01:20:53.883 --> 01:20:55.416
but I am sticking to the plan.

01:20:55.418 --> 01:20:56.884
Now, you and Louise
can get her home

01:20:56.886 --> 01:20:58.586
as soon as you have
an opportunity.

01:20:58.588 --> 01:21:01.255
Nice to have met you, Louise,
take care of her.

01:21:07.062 --> 01:21:08.562
Unbelievable.

01:21:29.084 --> 01:21:30.150
Huh.

01:21:32.487 --> 01:21:34.121
What, grandma?

01:21:34.123 --> 01:21:37.925
Must be the rodeo clown in you.

01:21:46.434 --> 01:21:48.469
All you got to do
is get their attention.

01:21:48.471 --> 01:21:50.905
As soon as they are following you,
jump in the bushes and text us.

01:21:50.907 --> 01:21:52.907
We'll send up the balloons
and then you can ditch the suit.

01:21:52.909 --> 01:21:54.308
All right.

01:21:54.310 --> 01:21:56.610
Jen will meet you later
at home later, okay?

01:21:56.612 --> 01:21:58.112
You got it?
Got it.

01:21:58.114 --> 01:22:01.148
Hey.

01:22:01.150 --> 01:22:02.483
Be careful.

01:22:08.056 --> 01:22:09.456
Go get 'em, baby!

01:22:13.361 --> 01:22:16.964
You know you were a jerk.

01:22:16.966 --> 01:22:19.400
Thanks, grandma.

01:22:19.402 --> 01:22:22.703
You really need to apologize.

01:22:22.705 --> 01:22:24.171
I need to apologize?

01:22:24.173 --> 01:22:25.205
Uh-huh.

01:22:25.207 --> 01:22:27.074
She called me chief.

01:22:27.076 --> 01:22:30.678
Which is a title of respect.

01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:33.547
She should have
called you Tonto.

01:22:33.549 --> 01:22:35.950
It means stupid.

01:22:45.694 --> 01:22:49.563
Something wrong
with our plan, officer?

01:22:51.499 --> 01:22:53.100
Where should I begin?

01:22:53.102 --> 01:22:54.535
This is standard
federal response

01:22:54.537 --> 01:22:57.004
to a threat to
homeland security, so...

01:22:57.006 --> 01:22:59.006
I've read the book.

01:22:59.008 --> 01:23:01.508
Just think that It's overkill

01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:03.010
for a bear sighting.

01:23:03.012 --> 01:23:04.545
Overkill?

01:23:04.547 --> 01:23:06.380
<i>You didn't see that creature.</i>

01:23:06.382 --> 01:23:09.984
<i>I assure you this</i>
<i>is not overkill.</i>

01:23:09.986 --> 01:23:13.354
Fine, just make sure you
write in your report

01:23:13.356 --> 01:23:15.089
that I told you it
would be a mistake

01:23:15.091 --> 01:23:17.291
to call in the military

01:23:17.293 --> 01:23:19.026
over a bear sighting.

01:23:19.028 --> 01:23:21.362
It was not a bear.

01:23:21.364 --> 01:23:24.264
Agent Wesson,
It's always a bear.

01:23:24.266 --> 01:23:25.566
Are you fucking blind?

01:23:25.568 --> 01:23:27.134
There it is!

01:23:27.136 --> 01:23:28.235
<i>That's not a bear!</i>

01:23:28.237 --> 01:23:29.470
<i>Let's go!</i>

01:23:29.472 --> 01:23:32.206
Nope, just a dumb-ass.

01:23:36.311 --> 01:23:39.480
I can not believe
I screwed this up so much.

01:23:39.482 --> 01:23:41.415
David screwed up.
You tried to apologize.

01:23:41.417 --> 01:23:43.183
No, I'm not talking
about David.

01:23:43.185 --> 01:23:45.052
Okay, then what are
you talking about?

01:23:45.054 --> 01:23:47.087
Hairy girl.

01:23:47.089 --> 01:23:48.489
They've been coming here
for who knows how long

01:23:48.491 --> 01:23:51.125
without any problems
until we screwed it up.

01:23:51.127 --> 01:23:53.560
We'll fix it.
I hope so.

01:23:53.562 --> 01:23:55.295
David's still an asshole.

01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:59.400
Okay. Ten thousand
freaking dollars

01:23:59.402 --> 01:24:00.601
and you couldn't find
one person to help us.

01:24:00.603 --> 01:24:01.735
Shh.

01:24:03.438 --> 01:24:06.240
Hey, art, we just
got a report of

01:24:06.242 --> 01:24:09.309
<i>a high-speed chase</i>
<i>and bigfoot running down main.</i>

01:24:09.311 --> 01:24:10.544
Do you know what the hell
is going on?

01:24:10.546 --> 01:24:12.446
Hairy man's just a dumb-ass kid.

01:24:12.448 --> 01:24:14.782
Nothing to get excited about.

01:24:14.784 --> 01:24:17.484
Don't let them around.

01:24:17.486 --> 01:24:18.519
Don't let them around,
don't let... come on, Mike.

01:24:18.521 --> 01:24:21.355
Oh, fuck!

01:24:21.357 --> 01:24:22.489
Asshole!

01:24:37.439 --> 01:24:39.106
He's getting away!

01:24:39.108 --> 01:24:41.028
He's not getting away.
We're right fucking there.

01:24:43.445 --> 01:24:45.712
God damn it!
Come on!

01:24:45.714 --> 01:24:48.148
Sorry. I never could figure
these things out.

01:24:58.860 --> 01:25:01.261
Can you get her to
her den by yourself?

01:25:01.263 --> 01:25:02.429
Yes.

01:25:02.431 --> 01:25:03.464
I gotta go help.

01:25:03.466 --> 01:25:04.665
I know.

01:25:04.667 --> 01:25:06.100
I know. Go.

01:25:06.102 --> 01:25:07.167
I love you, grandma.

01:25:07.169 --> 01:25:08.335
Mm-hmm.
I love you, too.

01:25:08.337 --> 01:25:09.837
Be careful.

01:25:09.839 --> 01:25:11.672
Here, you take the wheel.

01:25:11.674 --> 01:25:13.207
No, just take the wheel.

01:25:13.209 --> 01:25:16.110
Whoa. What are you doing?

01:25:16.112 --> 01:25:17.144
What are you doing?

01:25:17.146 --> 01:25:18.278
I'm gonna get him.

01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:20.414
Do you see him?
Where is he?

01:25:27.423 --> 01:25:28.689
What? Seriously?

01:25:30.358 --> 01:25:32.526
He's straight ahead,
straight ahead.

01:25:32.528 --> 01:25:34.428
What?
What are you doing?

01:25:34.430 --> 01:25:37.231
Put the gun down!
Put the gun down!

01:25:38.701 --> 01:25:40.467
Shit, shit, shit! No!

01:25:42.871 --> 01:25:45.305
<i>Hey, Dwayne.</i>
<i>Here you go.</i>

01:25:45.307 --> 01:25:47.508
Hey, rc, thanks.

01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:48.709
<i>You're welcome.</i>

01:25:48.711 --> 01:25:50.477
What's going on
around here tonight?

01:25:50.479 --> 01:25:53.147
Bigfoot and a high-speed
chase down main.

01:25:53.149 --> 01:25:55.149
It's David and Rodney again.

01:25:55.151 --> 01:25:56.617
I don't know what the hell
they're up to but...

01:25:56.619 --> 01:25:58.318
One of their
girlfriends called Ben.

01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:00.420
Needs a crane rental tonight.

01:26:00.422 --> 01:26:02.723
- It's after 10:00.
<i>- Yeah, I know.</i>

01:26:02.725 --> 01:26:04.324
I don't know what the hell they're
up to, but they're putting something

01:26:04.326 --> 01:26:06.293
together up by the meeting
grounds.

01:26:06.295 --> 01:26:09.263
It's like one big damn party
around here tonight.

01:26:09.265 --> 01:26:11.398
Yeah, it is, isn't it?

01:26:13.368 --> 01:26:16.203
Hey, sheryl. Yeah, It's rc.

01:26:16.205 --> 01:26:19.406
There's a big party going on up
at the meeting grounds.

01:26:19.408 --> 01:26:21.542
No, no. Call the gals,

01:26:21.544 --> 01:26:24.311
get a bunch of beer
and head on up.

01:26:24.313 --> 01:26:26.647
No, I promise, It's going
to be a huge shit show.

01:26:26.649 --> 01:26:29.249
All right, have a good time.

01:26:29.251 --> 01:26:30.350
All right, man. I'll call you
from the road

01:26:30.352 --> 01:26:31.632
and let you know
what's going on.

01:26:32.755 --> 01:26:34.621
Come on, Rodney,
what's the hold-up?

01:26:38.193 --> 01:26:39.293
I don't know any
of those people.

01:26:39.295 --> 01:26:40.360
I don't know, either.

01:26:40.362 --> 01:26:42.329
Huh? Anything yet?
No.

01:26:42.331 --> 01:26:43.664
You got bars?
Four.

01:26:43.666 --> 01:26:45.332
We should have heard
from him by now.

01:26:45.334 --> 01:26:46.800
Come on, Rodney.

01:26:50.806 --> 01:26:52.372
I'm just going to wing him.

01:26:52.374 --> 01:26:54.208
There's only one...
don't wing him.

01:26:58.780 --> 01:27:00.314
<i>We're talking about Rodney.</i>

01:27:00.316 --> 01:27:02.249
<i>He'll be fine.</i>

01:27:02.251 --> 01:27:05.552
Oh, I guess that's what
ten grand will get you.

01:27:05.554 --> 01:27:07.387
Where's Rodney?

01:27:07.389 --> 01:27:08.789
You didn't hear from him?

01:27:08.791 --> 01:27:10.624
No, nothing.

01:27:11.860 --> 01:27:14.595
Oh, my God! He's
going to get killed!

01:27:14.597 --> 01:27:16.463
No, as long as we keep hearing
gunshots, he's not dead.

01:27:16.465 --> 01:27:18.532
We have to go down
there and find him.

01:27:18.534 --> 01:27:21.668
If Rodney dies, I'm going to
beat the crap out of you!

01:27:21.670 --> 01:27:23.403
Okay, that's cool.

01:27:23.405 --> 01:27:25.672
I got this.

01:27:25.674 --> 01:27:27.507
<i>Hey, art.</i>

01:27:27.509 --> 01:27:30.410

01:27:31.513 --> 01:27:34.648
Let's just keep it slow, boys.

Come on, let's go.

01:27:53.868 --> 01:27:56.270

01:28:09.385 --> 01:28:11.918
Oh, that's good.
I hate to see him back in jail.

01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:14.655
Hey, uh, where should
we send them now?

01:28:14.657 --> 01:28:16.923
<i>Uh, Oh, how about across</i>
<i>the river on old stage road?</i>

01:28:16.925 --> 01:28:19.059
Oh, that's a good one.

I'm sorry.
I was way out of line.

01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:30.771
Way out of the line.

01:28:36.044 --> 01:28:38.679
Oh, my God!
I killed Rodney!

01:28:38.681 --> 01:28:40.614
What the hell, guys!

01:28:40.616 --> 01:28:43.417
Rodney.

01:28:56.831 --> 01:28:59.066
Ugh!

01:28:59.068 --> 01:29:00.434
We're so hooped.

01:29:00.436 --> 01:29:02.836
They're only checking in town.

01:29:02.838 --> 01:29:04.104
That chopper's gonna
find your grandma.

01:29:04.106 --> 01:29:05.839
We're gonna be late.

01:29:08.476 --> 01:29:09.810
Drop me off at
the edge of town again,

01:29:09.812 --> 01:29:11.078
and I'll lead them up
to the clearing.

01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:12.479
The hell you are.

01:29:12.481 --> 01:29:14.781
You just got
destroyed by a car.

take him to the er.

01:29:16.552 --> 01:29:18.018

Well, I for one am
not going to leave

01:29:24.926 --> 01:29:26.126
I'll take care of it.

01:29:26.128 --> 01:29:27.127
