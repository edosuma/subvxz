You need to stay on script.

- Hi, baby. Hi.
- I'm so sorry.

23:07.178 --> 23:11.015
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit! Rice. Rice!

23:11.057 --> 23:12.767
Does anybody have rice?

23:12.809 --> 23:14.977
- Oh, my God...
- Eventually,

23:15.019 --> 23:18.731
maybe tell her he's alive.

23:27.365 --> 23:30.118
Whoa! Ah!
Mr. Brown!

23:30.159 --> 23:33.496
- You're back! You're back.
- Yeah. I'm back.

23:33.538 --> 23:36.290
Okay, okay, okay.
I can do this.

23:36.332 --> 23:38.793
Douchebag, thanks for telling me
you were leaving.

23:38.835 --> 23:40.461
I had them do
a wellness check on you,

23:40.503 --> 23:42.213
bust down your door,
slept in your bed.

23:42.255 --> 23:43.548
I was gone for an afternoon.

23:43.589 --> 23:45.859
Hey, how was it out there?
Did you bring me back anything?

23:45.883 --> 23:48.553
Oh... Actually,

23:48.594 --> 23:50.429
it's from Disney's Eternity.

23:50.471 --> 23:52.723
Yeah, the travel agent
had digital souvenirs.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.892
I love it.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.853
I freaking love it.

23:56.894 --> 23:58.437
Oh, my God.

23:58.479 --> 23:59.689
It is "Luke," right?

23:59.730 --> 24:01.315
Ah!

24:13.536 --> 24:15.121
Hey.

24:15.163 --> 24:17.415
I didn't even say "angel."
I was just thinking about you.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.458
Okay.

24:27.175 --> 24:28.801
Someone knew

24:28.843 --> 24:31.304
you were being ejected
and that you'd be vulnerable.

24:31.345 --> 24:33.222
I mean, who else knew
besides your mom?

24:33.264 --> 24:34.974
I don't know, but,

24:35.016 --> 24:37.297
I mean, if you found out,
then couldn't anyone at Horizen?

24:39.020 --> 24:41.731
You know,
you really are my angel.

24:41.772 --> 24:43.149
You saved my life.

24:43.191 --> 24:45.651
I can't believe you flew
all the way to L.A.

24:45.693 --> 24:47.778
What, you thought
I wouldn't even say goodbye?

24:47.820 --> 24:50.114
No, it's just...
I don't know.

24:50.156 --> 24:52.200
We parted on such
an awkward note yesterday.

24:52.241 --> 24:54.243
- You know, I just thought...
- Wait, what?

24:55.703 --> 24:57.622
Shit.

24:57.663 --> 24:59.123
Lucy.

24:59.165 --> 25:01.042
She suspended me,
and while I was out,

25:01.083 --> 25:04.378
she must've used my avatar.

25:04.420 --> 25:07.089
Um...

25:09.550 --> 25:11.177
What did you say to her?

25:14.430 --> 25:17.308
Just some things I've been
meaning to say for a while.

25:19.852 --> 25:21.520
Um...

25:21.562 --> 25:23.105
I mean, now that you're back...

25:23.147 --> 25:24.607
The only reason I'm back

25:24.649 --> 25:27.818
is because your girlfriend

25:27.860 --> 25:30.279
gave such a good review
to my boss' boss.

25:31.697 --> 25:33.449
Yeah, she has her moments.

25:33.491 --> 25:35.201
Yeah.
I'm just saying...

25:36.786 --> 25:39.080
maybe you should
speak with her first.

25:39.121 --> 25:42.166
Before you say to me

25:42.208 --> 25:44.543
whatever you said to Lucy.

25:44.585 --> 25:47.380
Yeah.

25:47.421 --> 25:50.216
I'm really happy you're back.

25:50.258 --> 25:52.260
Me too.

25:52.301 --> 25:54.929
Come on.

25:59.392 --> 26:00.893
Oh...

26:00.935 --> 26:03.729
No way.

26:03.771 --> 26:05.398
I think you've earned it.

26:05.439 --> 26:08.442
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Let's go.

26:15.491 --> 26:18.619
I can't believe
you fell for it again.

26:18.661 --> 26:20.288
I can't believe
you lied to me again.

26:20.329 --> 26:21.914
Aw.

26:21.956 --> 26:23.457
I trusted you.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.252
Unbelievable.

26:26.294 --> 26:27.545
Amazing.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.547
I'm going back
to Disney Eternity.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.257
- Oh, whoa.
- Mm-hmm.

26:31.299 --> 26:34.385
- Way too soon.
- Yeah. See you later.

26:36.595 --> 26:39.223
Oh, don't pout.

26:39.265 --> 26:41.267
Feels so good.
Mm.
