00:01.919 --> 00:03.628
Previously on Nurse Jackie...

00:04.421 --> 00:08.591
Fiona says Grace has been getting up
at night and unplugging appliances.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.927
I just don't want the house to burn down.

00:11.011 --> 00:13.471
One of my nurses
needs a pediatric psych referral.

00:13.555 --> 00:15.598
-Which one?
-She'd rather not say.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.060
Hey, guys.

00:20.854 --> 00:24.107
-Was that a walk of shame?
-I don't want to know.

00:24.191 --> 00:27.151
Your accent,
London with a touch of Sussex, right?

00:27.236 --> 00:29.487
-Indeed.
-I'm kind of an Anglophile.

00:29.571 --> 00:31.572
How convenient, I'm an Anglo.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.284
You paid a publicist, didn't you?

00:38.038 --> 00:40.081
I have a publicist, yes,

00:40.165 --> 00:44.752
but that is not why I was chosen for the list
of the best 25 doctors in Manhattan.

00:45.003 --> 00:46.003
Hey, honey.

00:48.632 --> 00:51.551
Hey. Eddie. I'm a friend of Kevin's.

02:18.514 --> 02:19.847
Mrs. Feinberg?

02:23.602 --> 02:25.895
-Can I take this with my blood pill?
-Absolutely.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.397
But you take this one, Lopressor,
at bedtime.

02:28.482 --> 02:31.526
Don't take any antacids till morning.
Be careful about getting up too fast.

02:31.610 --> 02:34.320
You might have some dizziness. Good luck.

02:35.405 --> 02:36.781
Good luck!

02:39.535 --> 02:43.579
My house, my kids?
Are you out of your fucking mind?

02:43.664 --> 02:46.916
-I miss you.
-You cannot come to my house, Eddie.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.835
I want things back the way they were.

02:48.919 --> 02:51.921
I don't give a shit. This is the behavior
of a fucking psychopath.

02:52.005 --> 02:54.131
What? Mine or yours?

02:54.216 --> 02:58.135
-I can't just turn it off like you can.
-I didn't turn it off, Eddie.

02:58.220 --> 03:01.681
-I have a family.
-A family? Right, right.

03:01.765 --> 03:06.477
Do you want to know what your problem is?
You're fucking greedy is what you are.

03:10.899 --> 03:13.442
And you have a lot of pent-up anger.

03:17.155 --> 03:18.781
You have no idea.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.119
Next!

03:34.464 --> 03:36.674
Hey, honey, yeah.

03:36.758 --> 03:41.345
How do you feel about maybe sending
the girls to your sister's for the night?

03:41.430 --> 03:43.598
No, I'm good. I'm great, actually.

03:43.682 --> 03:48.019
I was just thinking it had been a while
since we had a date night, don't you think?

03:48.103 --> 03:50.438
Yeah, okay. Great.

03:51.857 --> 03:54.483
Yeah, I love you, too. Bye.

04:00.449 --> 04:03.242
So, now it's kind of nice,
being in one place.

04:03.327 --> 04:06.954
Actually getting to know the staff,
I used to be afraid of that.

04:07.039 --> 04:11.000
But now I feel really ready to say,
"Hey, what's your name?"

04:11.084 --> 04:13.836
I even feel like, "Shit, if there's
a softball team, I'm gonna be on it."

04:13.921 --> 04:15.546
But I'm not saying
I'm any good or anything.

04:15.631 --> 04:17.715
Sam, I don't do chatty.

04:20.218 --> 04:23.429
He can't breathe. Please, he can't breathe.

04:23.513 --> 04:25.097
Calm down, ma'am.
We're going to help him.

04:25.182 --> 04:26.933
Let me take him, please.

04:27.017 --> 04:29.518
I had the carpet shampooed.
I think he's having a reaction.

04:29.603 --> 04:33.439
-I don't know, he's not breathing.
-Page Dr. O'Hara. Follow me.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.026
-Is Jackie here?
-Not yet.

04:37.110 --> 04:40.571
Oh, shit. I need a doctor!

04:43.492 --> 04:45.242
Paging Dr. O'Hara.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.083
It's gonna be okay.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.210
Pulse weak and tachy.

04:55.087 --> 04:57.296
He needs Epi and Solu-medrol.

05:03.428 --> 05:05.596
Breathing has stopped.
We need to intubate.

05:05.681 --> 05:07.348
-Dr. O'Hara's on her way.
-Okay.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.394
He's turning blue.

05:15.148 --> 05:18.401
-I can't wait.
-Legally, we can't do this.

05:18.485 --> 05:19.860
We have to.

05:20.529 --> 05:22.154
Oh, crap.

05:23.699 --> 05:25.992
Grab a pediatric crash cart.

05:26.076 --> 05:30.371
I need a 2 blade and a 5.0 cuff tube.

05:31.707 --> 05:34.041
Tuck under his shoulder blade.

05:37.129 --> 05:38.587
Extend the neck.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.179
Be careful with that.

05:59.234 --> 06:01.902
Color changed. It's in.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.156
Lost his pulse.

06:07.576 --> 06:08.868
Starting compressions.

06:21.256 --> 06:22.757
Sinus rhythm.

06:26.887 --> 06:30.431
We have a pulse. Zoey, you did it.

06:37.773 --> 06:40.232
Zoey just saved his life. Twice.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.903
Also she intubated. Don't be mad.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.572
No one can know.
She could lose her license.

06:47.074 --> 06:50.326
So, I suggest we stop talking about it.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.704
He's going to be okay.

06:53.789 --> 06:56.874
Dr. O'Hara's here now.
She's an amazing doctor.

07:09.012 --> 07:12.723
Jesus, it smells like disinfectant
and dip in here.

07:12.808 --> 07:14.809
-It's truly vile.
-Sorry.

07:15.393 --> 07:19.230
-One man's nectar is another man's...
-You're disgusting. Eat fruit.

07:19.314 --> 07:20.481
Thanks.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.150
Zoey!

07:24.277 --> 07:26.862
Kudos on the lifesaving victory
this morning.

07:27.114 --> 07:30.574
-The what?
-I just made sure someone didn't die.

07:30.659 --> 07:32.952
And Dr. O'Hara swooped in
at the last minute

07:33.036 --> 07:36.747
in her Oscar de la Renta skirt.
Disaster averted.

07:36.832 --> 07:39.583
He's alive, that's what matters.

07:39.668 --> 07:41.669
Bringing back the dead is a rush, isn't it?

07:41.753 --> 07:44.588
Last year at Sin Sin,
this guy OD'd outside the club.

07:44.673 --> 07:46.924
Thumped the shit out of him, no heartbeat.

07:47.008 --> 07:50.344
His girlfriend is screaming at him,
"Come back. Don't leave me!"

07:50.428 --> 07:53.514
So I get in there
and shock this guy one last time.

07:53.598 --> 07:56.684
Bang! He's back. Asking for a cigarette.

07:56.768 --> 08:00.187
No thanks, no nothing.
I didn't care. I felt incredible.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.274
Your food does smell bad, Lenny.

08:07.195 --> 08:09.196
Did you intubate without a doctor?

08:10.407 --> 08:12.032
I did what I had to.

08:12.534 --> 08:14.451
You do know how risky that was,
don't you?

08:15.078 --> 08:18.831
-Just doing what you would have done.
-Zoey.

08:23.628 --> 08:26.255
I never would have pegged you
as someone to give a shit

08:26.339 --> 08:28.340
for getting the job done.

08:32.304 --> 08:34.221
Don't eat by the urine!

08:34.556 --> 08:36.557
Jackie, let's talk later.

08:46.568 --> 08:47.818
Here. Good.

08:47.903 --> 08:50.654
Patient with lymphoma stage three
has severe dehydration

08:50.739 --> 08:53.908
due to constant nausea
after third round of chemo.

08:54.492 --> 08:56.619
All right, I'll start an IV.

08:59.122 --> 09:03.459
-What's your name, honey?
-Martin Vobernick.

09:03.919 --> 09:05.836
-You can't get any relief, huh?
-No.

09:05.921 --> 09:07.296
Any side effects?

09:07.714 --> 09:10.382
-I was on Zofran.
-Constipation, right?

09:11.259 --> 09:14.178
-I tried the whole Aloxi thing.
-The headaches are awful.

09:15.263 --> 09:17.264
Then they gave me Anzemet.

09:17.349 --> 09:20.100
So the headaches are gone,
but cramps and nausea, the diarrhea...

09:20.644 --> 09:23.270
-Can you tolerate the Decadron?
-Ulcers.

09:24.272 --> 09:26.649
God, I know you've seen
worse than me, but...

09:26.733 --> 09:28.317
Holy crap.

09:31.571 --> 09:32.780
Is it really worth it?

09:34.991 --> 09:36.033
Cold.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.207
Have you tried smoking pot?

09:45.877 --> 09:47.711
I'm a tour guide for the Red Line.

09:47.796 --> 09:51.465
I do crosswords
and I sing in a barbershop quartet.

09:52.509 --> 09:54.677
And I'm single. Obviously.

09:55.971 --> 09:59.598
-Where's a guy like me gonna find pot?
-Okay, now, Mr. Vobernick,

10:00.016 --> 10:03.143
it's really trial and error
with the antinausea meds,

10:03.228 --> 10:06.313
but I promise
I'm gonna find you something that works.

10:11.236 --> 10:14.905
We're going to do everything we can
to make you comfortable, okay?

10:25.250 --> 10:27.501
-What the hell did you say in there?
-What?

10:27.961 --> 10:31.255
-Please God, no.
-Suggesting a patient try pot?

10:31.339 --> 10:33.299
Never, and I mean never,

10:33.383 --> 10:36.302
do you suggest a patient use
an illegal substance to combat a symptom

10:36.386 --> 10:38.262
when there are perfectly viable
legal medications.

10:38.346 --> 10:40.014
I see. Is this part of the new image?

10:40.098 --> 10:43.267
The top 25 New York
fucking douche bag doctors?

10:43.351 --> 10:44.935
Please don't be such a boy scout, Coop.

10:45.020 --> 10:46.478
You know that if this guy lived
in a different state,

10:46.563 --> 10:49.064
he'd be able to get
a prescription for medical marijuana

10:49.149 --> 10:51.442
-so he could at least try it.
-He doesn't live in another state.

10:51.526 --> 10:54.236
-He lives in New York.
-I don't give a shit if he lives on Mars!

10:54.321 --> 10:56.530
I'm gonna make a suggestion
if I think it's going to help a patient.

10:56.614 --> 11:00.492
No, you're not!
I make suggestions, you listen and agree.

11:00.869 --> 11:03.370
Seriously, Jackie,
how high up do I have to go

11:03.455 --> 11:04.830
to lodge a complaint
for you to understand that?

11:05.332 --> 11:07.041
Really, is there somebody
higher up than you?

11:11.296 --> 11:14.590
-Did you get the morphine?
-I'm doing it right now.

11:14.966 --> 11:16.508
I got to tell you,
I thought it'd be a lot harder

11:16.593 --> 11:18.218
being around the meds than it is.

11:18.303 --> 11:20.012
I'm a little worried about infection here.

11:20.096 --> 11:23.015
Kind of an undertow, you know?
Going one way on the surface,

11:23.099 --> 11:25.934
but underneath,
getting pulled in another direction.

11:26.019 --> 11:30.189
Did Okebwai weigh in on this?
Because I didn't see it on the chart.

11:37.572 --> 11:40.074
My sponsor thinks I'm a sex addict.

11:43.536 --> 11:46.747
Were you standing this close to her
when she told you that?

11:46.831 --> 11:49.917
He's a guy, but probably.

11:52.587 --> 11:55.839
Well, now, we can't all be saints.

12:11.648 --> 12:14.650
-I have a girlfriend.
-So do I.

12:18.196 --> 12:20.447
So I was wondering if you had a chance

12:20.532 --> 12:23.826
to call that pediatric psychiatrist
I recommended.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.912
You're really going to make me
talk about this directly, aren't you?

12:26.996 --> 12:30.666
Jackie, people put up walls for a reason.

12:30.750 --> 12:34.044
And from time to time
the people around us pipe up.

12:34.129 --> 12:37.506
You need to tear down that wall.
I'm not one of those people.

12:37.590 --> 12:41.009
Sometimes the walls
are the only thing holding us up.

12:42.345 --> 12:43.554
Forget I asked.

12:47.934 --> 12:51.812
Well, she's only 10.
She fixates on the strangest things.

12:53.064 --> 12:57.067
She'd rather watch a fire safety video
than High School Musical.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.779
We can't get in to see Dr. Bowen
until next month.

13:00.864 --> 13:02.239
She's worth the wait.

13:04.534 --> 13:08.954
Apparently, she's also on the list
of the hottest doctors in New York.

13:09.956 --> 13:12.916
Is it my imagination, or is Coop
even more of a shit than he used to be?

13:13.001 --> 13:15.169
Are you referring to him
reprimanding you today?

13:15.253 --> 13:16.420
He told you?

13:16.504 --> 13:18.213
Listen, I understand
where he's coming from.

13:18.298 --> 13:21.675
Dr. Cooper simply does not want
nurses to advise patients

13:21.759 --> 13:24.636
to use illegal substances
to relieve pain or nausea.

13:24.721 --> 13:27.723
Gloria, this poor guy
has tried everything under the sun.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.309
-He cannot stop puking.
-Advocating for a patient

13:30.393 --> 13:32.936
to pursue illegal drugs
when they are under our care

13:33.021 --> 13:36.023
-here at All Saints Hospital...
-Is unacceptable. Got it.

13:36.191 --> 13:37.441
Can I go?

13:38.735 --> 13:39.776
Yes.

13:44.032 --> 13:47.868
Jackie, I'm not a prude.
I was at Woodstock, for Christ's sake.

13:50.538 --> 13:52.164
No, you weren't.

13:53.041 --> 13:57.336
-Jesus, Lenny, you're still here?
-Hey, I've been out and back two times.

13:57.420 --> 13:59.379
Concussion and appendix.

13:59.464 --> 14:02.341
And look at the caricature
I got made of Zoey.

14:02.425 --> 14:05.219
-Wow. It's cute.
-Dude did it off my iPhone.

14:05.303 --> 14:08.931
-I don't think Zoey likes it.
-Stop showing people that.

14:10.517 --> 14:13.393
I sent the tib-fib in five to the OR.

14:15.522 --> 14:19.024
And there are two lonely bottles of
Lidocaine sitting in the scrub sink.

14:19.108 --> 14:21.068
Don't know why, don't care.
Someone get them.

14:25.240 --> 14:27.908
-What?
-Lunch, now.

14:33.623 --> 14:34.665
Well?

14:37.460 --> 14:39.378
-I shagged a nurse.
-No!

14:39.462 --> 14:42.839
-In the chapel.
-No! Oh, God. It was Sam, wasn't it?

14:42.924 --> 14:45.634
Poor little thing is a recovering addict.
Did you know that?

14:45.718 --> 14:49.805
Of course I knew that. Everyone knows that.
It's all he talks about. Pain in my ass.

14:49.889 --> 14:53.767
Just think about it from his perspective.
No booze, no sex, no drugs.

14:53.851 --> 14:55.185
Hardly worth getting out of bed
in the morning.

14:56.604 --> 14:59.940
-He really bugs you, doesn't he?
-It's his holier-than-thou bullshit. Please.

15:00.024 --> 15:01.191
Boring.

15:01.818 --> 15:05.237
-Anyway, tell me more about Eddie.
-Nothing. It's over. It's done.

15:05.321 --> 15:09.032
You know, whatever we had
is now a big, fat, fucked up mess.

15:09.450 --> 15:12.327
-Well, you are married.
-Yes, there is that.

15:14.289 --> 15:15.789
It's my fault.

15:18.126 --> 15:20.294
I just didn't see it coming.

15:21.546 --> 15:25.215
I think the overdosing stalker in him
was just lying dormant.

15:25.300 --> 15:26.592
Yeah, maybe.

15:26.676 --> 15:29.386
Have you ever worried he'll go to Kevin
and spill the beans?

15:29.470 --> 15:32.139
No. What would he have then?

15:32.223 --> 15:33.557
Well, everyone's life in ruins.

15:33.641 --> 15:35.309
"If I can't have her,
no one can" kind of thing.

15:35.393 --> 15:37.269
No, he's not that guy.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.063
You know, he loves me.

15:40.148 --> 15:43.233
There's a little bit of hate
mixed in there now, of course.

15:44.235 --> 15:45.402
Do you love him?

15:49.782 --> 15:54.161
-If I said yes, what would that make me?
-I don't judge if you don't judge.

15:57.707 --> 15:58.915
Are you coming?

15:59.334 --> 16:02.419
Not just yet. Quick errand. I'll see you there.

16:07.675 --> 16:11.595
-Hey, chief.
-Hey, man. What's up?

16:13.181 --> 16:17.142
You and me, tonight, third-base line.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.020
-Shit.
-What?

16:20.146 --> 16:23.523
I would love to, but I can't.
Jackie called a date night for tonight.

16:24.901 --> 16:26.943
-The requisite date night.
-Yeah.

16:27.028 --> 16:29.613
-I know it well.
-These are great seats!

16:29.697 --> 16:30.781
Yeah.

16:33.201 --> 16:36.953
Yeah. You got a Bud?

16:37.038 --> 16:40.332
-Yeah.
-What are you gonna do?

17:00.436 --> 17:02.771
-Hi.
-Hey.

17:03.606 --> 17:06.191
-You okay?
-Not really.

17:06.943 --> 17:09.111
Fuck. Oh, God.

17:11.364 --> 17:16.159
Listen, just so you know,
I'm not in recovery.

17:16.994 --> 17:20.706
Although I should be
for wedding cake addiction.

17:20.790 --> 17:24.793
Anyway, I know how important it is
to have someone to talk to

17:24.877 --> 17:27.337
when you're having feelings.

17:28.506 --> 17:30.674
Yeah, I am.

17:31.592 --> 17:37.055
If you want, you could consider me
your workplace sponsor.

17:39.559 --> 17:40.767
Thank you.

17:45.940 --> 17:47.274
I slipped.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.444
Go ahead.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.740
-I slept with a doctor.
-I'm not talking to you.

17:58.953 --> 17:59.953
Okay.

18:04.083 --> 18:07.544
-What are you doing?
-Dr. Cooper released me.

18:07.628 --> 18:13.258
He gave me a prescription for EMEND
and the name of a biofeedback clinic.

18:14.260 --> 18:17.262
Okay. Let's get you in the chair.

18:28.399 --> 18:31.151
So I have over 1,000 Twitter followers now.

18:31.235 --> 18:32.944
-Is that a lot?
-Hell, yeah.

18:34.405 --> 18:37.240
It just so happens
I'm fascinating to the masses.

18:37.325 --> 18:40.994
See, there's my magazine article
and my tweets.

18:41.454 --> 18:44.664
-I'm exploding.
-Need a pen, thank you.

18:45.333 --> 18:47.584
Here, I'll show you how it works.

18:47.668 --> 18:50.086
"Grabby nurse just borrowed my pen."

18:50.171 --> 18:53.340
All right, now you've got,
"Nurse going to vending machines."

18:54.634 --> 18:56.760
-Lenny, where's your rig?
-Fire lane.

18:56.844 --> 18:58.386
Let's go.

19:19.367 --> 19:20.700
Okay, so...

19:22.662 --> 19:25.664
You light her up, you inhale through here.

19:30.753 --> 19:32.337
Give it a whirl.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.559
You got to take a deep breath
and hold it for a minute.

19:53.067 --> 19:54.734
Good, that's good.

19:56.737 --> 19:58.405
That's very good.

20:01.117 --> 20:05.328
-How'd you know I had pot?
-Lenny, Mountain Dew and Doritos? Please.

20:06.080 --> 20:07.539
Yeah.

20:07.623 --> 20:10.250
Where'd you learn
how to make that apple bong?

20:10.793 --> 20:13.003
Jones Beach, Toto concert.

20:14.547 --> 20:15.797
Fuck you.

20:19.969 --> 20:21.094
You feel better?

20:22.805 --> 20:26.141
Yeah, I'm actually hungry.

20:27.602 --> 20:30.103
I bet Lenny can give you a hand with that.

20:30.897 --> 20:34.024
-Hey, can we turn on the siren?
-Easy, tiger.

20:34.108 --> 20:36.610
All right, I got to get back. Take care.

20:37.361 --> 20:40.113
-Thank you for this.
-Can you give Martin a ride home?

20:40.197 --> 20:43.617
-Sure.
-Turn on the siren when you get to Park.

20:48.623 --> 20:50.874
-Shotgun.
-Bring it.

20:52.752 --> 20:57.047
Hey, Jackie, I think I'm gonna
personally follow up with Mr. Vobernick.

20:57.131 --> 20:59.341
I'm gonna call him next week,
see how the medication's working.

20:59.425 --> 21:02.552
That's very nice of you. I'm sure
he'll be very happy to hear from you.

21:02.637 --> 21:04.804
I know I seemed like a tight-ass earlier,

21:04.889 --> 21:08.516
but you do understand that
with the list and the Twitter following,

21:08.601 --> 21:11.061
I have even more of an example
to set around here now.

21:11.145 --> 21:12.646
Yep, duly noted.

21:12.730 --> 21:14.731
But I seriously do feel that we need to use

21:14.815 --> 21:17.567
what science and medicine have given us
to treat patients.

21:17.652 --> 21:20.320
I understand.
Sometimes I just prefer mother nature.

21:21.697 --> 21:27.494
And, you know,
if you think that I've never tried the reefer,

21:27.870 --> 21:29.371
think again.

21:31.582 --> 21:32.916
Are you trying to whistle?

21:53.479 --> 21:55.063
They're for you.

21:56.399 --> 21:58.775
-Excuse me?
-Good work.

22:37.481 --> 22:40.066
-That the kid from this morning?
-Yes.

22:47.783 --> 22:49.576
I think I'm pregnant.

23:11.849 --> 23:15.602
-Hey, honey.
-Okay, promise me you won't be pissed.

23:15.728 --> 23:18.354
-Not a great start.
-No, no, no, listen.

23:18.439 --> 23:22.025
The girls are at my sister's house
just like we planned.

23:22.109 --> 23:24.486
But I wanted to ask a favor.

23:25.696 --> 23:29.824
I was wondering if we could push
date night back a couple of hours.

23:29.909 --> 23:33.536
-Kevin, you don't want to do it.
-No, I do. I totally do.

23:33.621 --> 23:37.874
-It's just I've been invited to a Mets game.
-Oh, Lord. By who?

23:37.958 --> 23:40.543
Eddie. The guy you met at the house.

23:40.628 --> 23:45.507
-Hey, Jackie. What's happening?
-He's right there. Let me say hi.

23:46.008 --> 23:47.801
She wants to say hi.

23:49.011 --> 23:51.846
-Hey, Jackie.
-You cannot be serious.

23:51.931 --> 23:55.475
Don't worry, I won't keep him out late.
I know tonight's a special one for you.

23:55.559 --> 23:58.686
-Do not do this.
-Right, right, no beers.

23:58.771 --> 24:01.272
Do not do this, Eddie. Do you hear me?

24:01.357 --> 24:03.733
Okay. Well, thank you very much.
We will have a great time.

24:03.818 --> 24:05.819
-Do not do this.
-All right. Take care.

24:10.199 --> 24:12.408
Hey. Hello?

24:15.079 --> 24:18.665
-Your wife is the greatest, man.
-She is. She totally is.

24:19.250 --> 24:23.002
-All right, subway or bus?
-Bus? What are you, 80?

24:24.964 --> 24:26.005
Bus.

25:00.875 --> 25:03.501
I feel pretty good from this afternoon.

25:03.586 --> 25:07.046
I haven't been able
to sit up and watch TV for months.

25:08.048 --> 25:12.719
Well, I think one of these a day
should be good for now.

25:12.803 --> 25:15.597
Let's say we try half of one for tonight.

25:22.563 --> 25:25.648
That's pretty tasty.
You're a nurse, you can bake, too.

25:25.733 --> 25:27.901
What can I say? I'm perfect.

25:30.237 --> 25:32.697
-Is that the Mets game?
-We're ahead.

25:32.781 --> 25:35.033
-For now.
-Yeah.

25:36.827 --> 25:40.038
Okay, this is the recipe here.

25:40.497 --> 25:41.873
For when these run out.

25:41.957 --> 25:44.542
On the back
is the number for Lenny's dealer.

25:44.627 --> 25:47.086
She's a nice lady. She's expecting your call.

25:47.171 --> 25:50.131
Wow. Does she know what a nerd I am?

25:50.758 --> 25:53.509
Why don't you just sit back and relax?
I'll put these in the fridge.

26:01.018 --> 26:04.520
Wow. When was the last time
you cleaned this thing out?

26:14.198 --> 26:15.281
Yes!
