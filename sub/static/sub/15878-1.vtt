[# James Bond Theme playing]

00:04.003 --> 00:06.165
Rory, what do you like
about James Bond?

00:06.272 --> 00:09.605
I like that he has a license to kill.

00:09.676 --> 00:12.167
[horn honking]

00:12.245 --> 00:13.610
Yeah, me too.

00:16.616 --> 00:19.346
No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:20.954 --> 00:23.320
No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:30.430 --> 00:33.399
- What's this one called?
- Kyle.

00:33.466 --> 00:37.334
- Hi, Paul Hennessy. Bridget's Dad.
- What's up! Kyle.

00:37.404 --> 00:39.338
Kyle. Right.

00:39.406 --> 00:43.103
Just so you know, Kyle, if you
ever pull into my driveway and honk,

00:43.176 --> 00:45.235
you'd better be delivering a package

00:45.311 --> 00:48.872
because you're sure as hell
not picking anything up.

00:50.083 --> 00:52.051
- Uh, sorry, Mr. Hennessy.
- Please.

00:52.152 --> 00:55.918
All the guys call me Paul, or
Sensei Paul, because of my black belt.

00:55.989 --> 00:59.720
- Whatever you're comfortable with.
- [phone ringing]

00:59.793 --> 01:01.920
[ringing continues]

01:04.197 --> 01:06.563
- Your pants are ringing.
- Yeah.

01:07.934 --> 01:10.835
What up, my brotha from anotha motha?

01:10.904 --> 01:14.271
Oh, Lindsey, yeah, I...

01:14.340 --> 01:17.571
I can't talk right now.
No, I'm at a friend's house.

01:17.644 --> 01:20.511
Yeah, just a friend.
Yeah. Late.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.878
- Mr. Hennessy...
- Please, Sensei.

01:24.417 --> 01:25.384
Lindsey, huh?

01:25.485 --> 01:28.716
You have other girlfriends, Kyle,
and that's fine with me...

01:28.788 --> 01:31.052
- Sweet.
...if it's OK with my daughter.

01:31.124 --> 01:34.252
Otherwise, you will continue
to date her and no one but her

01:34.327 --> 01:38.229
until she is finished with you.
If you make her cry, I'll make you cry.

01:38.298 --> 01:40.789
[grunts forcefully]

01:43.636 --> 01:45.797
- Hey, Kyle!
- Hey.

01:46.873 --> 01:49.433
Oh, my God, you talked to him.

01:50.910 --> 01:52.844
Little bit.

01:53.279 --> 01:57.579
You two have fun!
Later, my brotha from anotha motha!

02:04.991 --> 02:07.221
- Keys, keys, keys...
- Where are you going?

02:07.293 --> 02:10.262
You know this. I'm starting
the morning shift in ICU.

02:10.330 --> 02:13.891
- I have to get down to the paper.
- You're in charge of the kids today.

02:13.967 --> 02:17.403
Oh, right! That starts today.

02:17.470 --> 02:20.166
Actually, it started
when they were born.

02:20.240 --> 02:22.333
I just never worked mornings before.

02:22.408 --> 02:25.434
You know, you could call them
and tell them you're sick.

02:25.512 --> 02:27.571
Paul, you're doing this. Bye.

02:27.647 --> 02:30.138
This is a bad day for me.
I've got a huge deadline.

02:30.216 --> 02:33.583
Ed needs 800 words
on the boat show at Auburn Hills.

02:33.686 --> 02:38.521
OK, I'll tell the guy without a liver
to hold on because there's a boat show.

02:39.025 --> 02:40.788
- I owe you.
- [scoffs]

02:40.894 --> 02:42.657
Paul, if you love me,

02:42.729 --> 02:46.028
and if you ever want another shot
at a nurse fantasy...

02:46.099 --> 02:47.657
- And I do.
- And you do.

02:47.734 --> 02:50.430
...then you will stick to our plan
and share duties.

02:50.503 --> 02:52.869
- You're right.
- [Kerry] Bridget! Give me that!

02:52.972 --> 02:57.102
- [Bridget] That's my mirror!
- [Kerry] They're all your mirrors!

02:57.177 --> 03:00.340
OK. This is where
sharing the duties begins.

03:01.548 --> 03:04.711
Girls, don't make your mother
come up there!

03:07.987 --> 03:09.750
Good job.

03:10.957 --> 03:13.323
The boy. My boy.

03:13.393 --> 03:14.553
Hey, Dad.

03:14.627 --> 03:18.893
- Good morning, Care Bear.
- Yeah? Prove it.

03:18.965 --> 03:23.061
Someone's not getting any
Mickey Mouse pancakes today.

03:28.007 --> 03:31.670
Uh, Bridget... Why are you
dressed like that?

03:31.744 --> 03:34.872
It must be Casual Sex Day at school.

03:37.483 --> 03:40.043
Hey! At least I get...

03:40.920 --> 03:43.150
...look good.

03:43.223 --> 03:46.681
Cupcake, I think you missed
the word "under" in "underwear."

03:46.759 --> 03:50.525
I can see your bra and that slingshot
you're wearing under your pants.

03:50.630 --> 03:52.689
- It's a thong.
- It's floss.

03:52.765 --> 03:55.290
I can't wear anything else.
Panty lines. Hello.

03:55.368 --> 03:57.233
Panty lines, hello, are fine.

03:57.303 --> 04:00.670
- They were a big deal in my day.
- We're the Thong Generation.

04:00.740 --> 04:03.709
Well, maybe that's why
your generation is so angry.

04:03.776 --> 04:06.336
You're always walking around
with a wedgie.

04:10.316 --> 04:13.877
Hey, Dad, did you know Bridget's
got underpants with leopard spots?

04:13.987 --> 04:18.219
- What were you doing in my drawer?
- Showing my friends.

04:19.291 --> 04:21.055
- Oh God!
- No, no, no.

04:21.160 --> 04:23.025
Not the boy.
Never hit the boy.

04:23.997 --> 04:25.521
Go upstairs, cover up!

04:28.668 --> 04:30.329
[sighs]

04:34.374 --> 04:37.309
- Kerry, sweetie?
- What?!

04:37.377 --> 04:39.743
Problem in the coven?

04:41.114 --> 04:43.378
You're so immeasurably not funny.

04:43.449 --> 04:46.213
You seem like you're in
some kind of mood this morning.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.754
- Is everything OK?
- Stop yelling at me!

04:48.821 --> 04:49.981
I... Uh...

04:53.459 --> 04:55.290
I'm not yelling. Honey...

04:56.596 --> 04:58.325
...are you having your?

04:59.866 --> 05:01.629
Are you on your?

05:03.870 --> 05:04.928
Is it your...

05:08.741 --> 05:10.106
...birthday?

05:13.046 --> 05:16.607
No. It's not my... birthday.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.875
[screams]

05:18.985 --> 05:21.146
- What?
- Sack lunches?

05:21.254 --> 05:23.518
Only losers bring
their lunches to school.

05:23.589 --> 05:26.752
I brought a sack lunch every day
all throughout college.

05:27.393 --> 05:28.519
- Loser.
- Loser.

05:33.066 --> 05:34.966
- [Kerry] Stop here.
- [tires screech]

05:35.034 --> 05:37.161
[groans] Do not drop us off up front.

05:37.236 --> 05:40.205
And after we walk away,
do not shout something after us.

05:40.273 --> 05:41.297
- Or honk.
- Or wave.

05:41.374 --> 05:44.935
Don't say "you're welcome,"
like you're making a brilliant point

05:45.044 --> 05:46.875
because we didn't say "thank you."

Advertise your product or brand here

06:00.760 --> 06:02.387
Oh, Dad.

06:06.099 --> 06:10.365
Bridgie! Care Bear!
You forgot your lunches!

06:10.436 --> 06:12.597
You're welcome!

06:18.111 --> 06:20.944
- Hey, Hennessy, think fast!
- Damn it, Tommy! Come on!

06:21.013 --> 06:24.972
- I got a meeting with Ed in five.
- Easy. Ooh.

06:25.051 --> 06:28.111
I'm sorry. I'm just a little crazed
because of my kids.

06:28.187 --> 06:30.655
You should've seen
the way my daughter dressed.

06:30.723 --> 06:33.886
- Which one, the hot one?
- No. You can't call her that.

06:33.993 --> 06:36.086
- Right. Not in front of you.
- Not ever.

06:36.162 --> 06:38.995
- Well...
- No, come on, you know.

06:39.065 --> 06:41.625
- You've got teenagers.
- But I've got the good kind.

06:41.734 --> 06:43.258
Boys.

06:43.336 --> 06:46.396
Boys are great.
My little guy's something, though.

06:46.472 --> 06:49.202
He made the flag football team
this year. Defensive End.

06:49.275 --> 06:52.608
Cute. Wanna hear something?
Guess what I found in Kyle's room?

06:52.678 --> 06:54.942
- What?
- Come on, guess. Condoms.

06:56.282 --> 07:00.412
- The big ones.
- Hey! Father of girls here.

07:00.486 --> 07:03.387
- What?
- You and I are no longer friends.

07:03.456 --> 07:05.481
When were we friends?
Whoa...

07:05.558 --> 07:07.321
Watch out for that one.

07:07.794 --> 07:10.524
Come on, relax, he's 17.
What were you like at his age?

07:10.596 --> 07:12.723
- Horrible.
- Well...

07:12.799 --> 07:14.460
Horrible!

07:14.534 --> 07:17.298
- Wait a minute! Kyle?
- He goes to your kids' school.

07:17.403 --> 07:19.667
Got kicked out of the old school.

07:19.739 --> 07:22.435
In fact, I think he's friends
with the hot...

07:22.508 --> 07:23.770
- Bridget.
- Hot Bridget.

07:23.843 --> 07:25.743
- Tommy...
- [phone ringing]

07:25.812 --> 07:29.543
I don't want to talk about the girls
right now. They're safe in school.

07:29.615 --> 07:32.311
Suspended? Kerry's suspended?

07:32.385 --> 07:33.545
She was ditching.

07:33.619 --> 07:36.247
This isn't like her.
She's an honor student.

07:36.322 --> 07:41.089
I have to ask, has anything big
happened in the home recently?

07:41.160 --> 07:46.894
Well, before I switched to columnist,
I was named Sportswriter of the Month.

07:50.470 --> 07:55.237
- How would that affect Kerry?
- It can't be easy living in my shadow.

07:56.876 --> 08:02.041
- She doesn't care about your shadow.
- Come on, Sportswriter of the Month.

08:02.915 --> 08:05.782
I meant something that
might be upsetting to the kids.

08:05.852 --> 08:07.513
- Cate went back to work.
- What?

08:07.587 --> 08:10.818
- Which was a mutual decision.
- I had to go back to work.

08:10.890 --> 08:14.826
Bridget is two years away from college,
and unless she gets a scholarship...

08:14.894 --> 08:16.259
[laughing]

08:21.567 --> 08:23.660
I'm sorry. Go on.

08:23.736 --> 08:28.002
Both of us working and sharing duties
seems like the only way to make it work.

08:28.074 --> 08:30.975
- Commendable.
- I make lunches and drive the kids.

08:31.043 --> 08:33.671
- Once. You did it once.
- I got them to school, didn't I?

08:33.746 --> 08:36.510
Next time make sure they walk
all the way in the building.

08:36.582 --> 08:39.015
Hello! People.

08:39.085 --> 08:40.450
Look, Kerry's a good kid,

08:40.553 --> 08:43.647
but she's at that age where
there's a lot of peer pressure.

08:43.722 --> 08:45.486
Drugs, sex, you name it.

08:45.591 --> 08:48.890
And as parents,
you need to ask the hard questions.

08:51.597 --> 08:54.327
Kerry, your father and I
are very disappointed...

08:54.400 --> 08:55.731
[beeping]

08:55.801 --> 08:57.496
Oh, my God, it's the hospital.

08:58.738 --> 09:00.205
I have to get back.

09:00.273 --> 09:03.504
But, Kerry, I will be home tonight
and we will talk then, OK?

09:04.076 --> 09:06.044
- You got this?
- Handled.

09:27.333 --> 09:29.426
I got your nose.

09:34.540 --> 09:36.030
[knocking]

09:36.108 --> 09:39.236
- Kerry?
- Dad, can I go to the library?

09:39.312 --> 09:41.337
- Just a second. Kerry?
- [horn honking]

09:41.414 --> 09:43.382
Uh, that's my ride. Bye.

09:43.482 --> 09:46.246
- Uh... I've decided you can go.
- [door closes]

09:47.386 --> 09:48.512
- Honey?
- What?!

09:48.588 --> 09:52.718
Now come on, I gave you enough...
Just a second.

10:00.533 --> 10:02.694
What? I come in here
to think sometimes.

10:02.802 --> 10:04.269
Get out!

10:09.241 --> 10:12.369
I let you have
the entire afternoon to chill.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.571
Oh, God.

10:13.646 --> 10:17.605
You gotta tell me why you're ditching
school. What's going on, Care Bear?

10:17.683 --> 10:19.708
Stop calling me that!

10:19.785 --> 10:23.084
God, one Halloween costume at five
and it sticks for life.

10:23.823 --> 10:27.054
Do I call you Man With Ax In Head?

10:27.960 --> 10:31.054
Kerry, I am your father.

10:31.130 --> 10:35.157
You can tell me anything, anything.
Anything?

10:35.234 --> 10:37.464
Stop looking at my pupils!
I'm not on drugs!

10:37.536 --> 10:40.835
I'm not accusing you.
Should I be? I mean, you know, I...

10:40.906 --> 10:44.273
There are certain signs.

10:44.343 --> 10:46.607
You lost interest in soccer like that.

10:46.679 --> 10:50.012
Yeah, in the third grade.
The coach wouldn't let me play.

10:50.082 --> 10:52.812
You were too little.
I was afraid to send you in.

10:53.919 --> 10:57.548
Well, something's going on with you,
whether it's drugs or...

10:59.358 --> 11:00.586
Are you using this?

11:01.627 --> 11:04.152
My retainer? Yes.

11:07.099 --> 11:11.001
- No, I'm not using birth control.
- Good.

11:11.070 --> 11:13.368
- So, you...
- No, I don't need birth control.

11:13.439 --> 11:14.963
Better.

11:15.374 --> 11:16.841
[giggles]

11:16.909 --> 11:18.240
What?

11:18.310 --> 11:20.540
It's funny that you're
worried about me,

11:20.613 --> 11:23.673
when Bridget says stuff like,
"I'm going to the library."

11:34.894 --> 11:36.555
"Hey, babe"?

11:37.296 --> 11:38.957
"Hey, sexy"?

11:39.865 --> 11:41.423
"Dat U?"

11:44.036 --> 11:46.004
"Yes, it me.

11:46.105 --> 11:50.007
Who dis... dawg?"

11:52.445 --> 11:55.005
"Jesse"? "Chatrooms"?

11:55.981 --> 11:57.949
Oh, my God!

11:58.050 --> 11:59.915
[phone ringing]

11:59.985 --> 12:01.509
- Hello?
- [Bridget] Hey, Dad.

12:01.587 --> 12:03.919
Can you get me at the mall?
Lindsey's car died.

12:03.989 --> 12:07.425
Mall? What happened,
and please try to be coherent.

12:07.493 --> 12:10.360
We were on our way to the library,
but Lindsey's car died

12:10.429 --> 12:14.195
but Amanda and Brooke were getting
a picture taken for Brooke's birthday,

12:14.300 --> 12:16.666
which I want for mine,
they give you a makeover.

12:16.769 --> 12:19.499
Wendy did one with this cowboy hat,
which was so cute.

12:19.572 --> 12:22.336
- When I say coherent... Who's Jesse?
- Skittles.

12:22.441 --> 12:25.376
- Skittles?
- I'm getting Skittles for the movies.

12:25.444 --> 12:27.674
- Who said you could go?
- I can't help it.

12:27.747 --> 12:30.011
- I'm getting a nosebleed.
- You never listen.

12:30.082 --> 12:33.051
- Who is Jesse?
- Forget it. I'll ride with a stranger.

12:33.152 --> 12:35.620
No, don't you hang up on me.
Don't hang...

12:35.688 --> 12:37.713
God.

12:37.790 --> 12:39.087
[grunts]

12:39.925 --> 12:41.187
- Where you going?
- Out.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.023
- Mall?
- Yeah.

12:51.203 --> 12:55.071
Hey, check this out,
me checking you out.

12:55.141 --> 12:57.200
Checking me out,
checking you out.

12:57.276 --> 12:59.301
Yeah, I'm checking you out.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.338
Kyle!

13:02.915 --> 13:06.146
Hey, security, you've got
to stop that behavior over there.

13:06.685 --> 13:08.118
They're holding hands.

13:08.187 --> 13:10.678
Give me your pepper spray.
Just for a minute.

13:10.756 --> 13:12.621
Don't tempt me.

13:15.294 --> 13:18.559
- Hey, Kyle.
- I gotta go.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.964
Hey, check this out.
Me checking you out,

13:22.034 --> 13:24.525
checking me out,
checking you out.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.893
[clears throat]

13:50.629 --> 13:52.597
Oh. Hey!

13:53.632 --> 13:57.363
- What are you doing here?
- Uh... Oh, I just, uh...

13:57.436 --> 14:00.803
I had to pick up a new screwdriver,
the old one wouldn't...

14:06.846 --> 14:08.313
You need a ride home?

14:10.182 --> 14:11.547
Mm-hmm.

14:17.089 --> 14:19.421
- This is nice.
- What?

14:19.491 --> 14:22.949
You usually don't let me
put my arm around you.

14:23.028 --> 14:24.757
Oh, my God.

14:34.840 --> 14:38.867
So, you really never planned
on going to the library, did you?

14:38.944 --> 14:42.277
Sure, she did,
right after her Mensa meeting.

14:44.283 --> 14:47.047
Mensa is a club for geniuses.

14:47.152 --> 14:50.883
- I know what Mensa is.
- Kerry, this is private.

14:50.956 --> 14:52.321
OK.

14:53.125 --> 14:57.858
- Geniuses are really smart people.
- Kerry! Out!

15:00.900 --> 15:02.629
Bridgie, the truth, come on.

15:04.003 --> 15:07.063
All right, well I was trying
to run into Kyle.

15:07.139 --> 15:11.007
I hoped he'd ask me to the homecoming
dance, but that's not gonna happen.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.805
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

15:12.878 --> 15:15.176
She's already going with Dustin.

15:15.247 --> 15:17.681
- Oh, my God!
- Bridget!

15:18.317 --> 15:21.582
- You already have a date?
- Yeah, but I could do a lot better.

15:21.654 --> 15:23.383
I mean, come on.

15:25.424 --> 15:28.450
I'm past deadline,
sitting here feeling sorry for you

15:28.527 --> 15:31.690
when you're at the mall
scamming for somebody better?

15:31.764 --> 15:34.232
- Did he say "scamming"?
- He also says "chill."

15:34.300 --> 15:35.597
Eww.

15:35.668 --> 15:37.226
- Look at his pants.
- I know.

15:37.336 --> 15:39.566
All right! Kerry, out!

15:39.638 --> 15:42.766
- Bridget, you are grounded for a month.
- What? No, no, no.

15:42.841 --> 15:46.004
- One week and I clean my room?
- No negotiating. Three weeks!

15:46.078 --> 15:48.979
- One week, clean my room, no allowance.
- Two weeks.

15:49.048 --> 15:52.609
- Well, let that be a lesson to her.
- All right, now you...

15:54.687 --> 15:58.453
I am sick of your smartass attitude.
You're not going to homecoming either.

15:58.557 --> 16:00.991
- I wasn't going anyway.
- How come?

16:01.060 --> 16:03.290
'Cause it's stupid.

16:04.029 --> 16:07.658
'Cause it's for idiots.
'Cause, God...

16:10.502 --> 16:13.437
- 'Cause no one asked her.
- Uh, yeah.

16:18.444 --> 16:19.775
[knocking]

16:20.346 --> 16:21.813
- Kerry?
- Go away!

16:21.880 --> 16:24.314
Look, Kerry, come on,
please talk to me.

16:24.383 --> 16:27.682
- You got to let me in sometimes.
- Leave.

16:31.056 --> 16:32.990
No, stay.

16:35.694 --> 16:37.184
Dad...

16:38.831 --> 16:41.925
...do you think I'm pretty?

16:42.001 --> 16:45.266
Well, of course I think you're pretty.

16:45.337 --> 16:49.467
What about that guy who hugged you?
I bet he thinks you're pretty.

16:49.541 --> 16:50.838
Him?

16:52.344 --> 16:56.906
I'm his friend.
I'm everybody's friend.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.986
[sniffles] No one looks at me.

17:02.021 --> 17:05.354
Well, you know,

17:05.424 --> 17:08.587
maybe if you didn't dress so baggy.

17:08.660 --> 17:11.321
I mean, you know,

17:11.396 --> 17:15.060
you're starting to get a really nice...
oh, boy... figure, and...

17:16.135 --> 17:19.400
...starting to develop things, so...

17:21.973 --> 17:23.601
Why hide it, I guess.

17:23.675 --> 17:25.973
- Do you want some money?
- Dad!

17:29.181 --> 17:32.241
I remember when you were born,
you had these huge eyes.

17:32.317 --> 17:35.252
These enormous, expressive eyes.

17:35.320 --> 17:37.288
Big, like on monkeys.

17:37.389 --> 17:40.825
No wait, wait. First,
see where I'm going with this.

17:40.893 --> 17:45.159
I got to watch this little girl

17:45.230 --> 17:48.495
catch up to these beautiful eyes

17:48.567 --> 17:52.867
and grow into this lovely young lady

17:52.938 --> 17:57.500
who looks particularly pretty right now
because, heaven forbid, she's smiling!

17:57.609 --> 18:00.874
A smile that can stop my heart.
Look at that, look at that.

18:00.946 --> 18:02.106
Stop it.

18:02.181 --> 18:05.446
So, in sum, yeah,

18:05.517 --> 18:07.451
I think you're very pretty.

18:13.225 --> 18:15.785
What do you know?
You're, like, 100.

18:33.512 --> 18:35.776
- Dad?
- What?

18:37.182 --> 18:39.275
Do you think I'm pretty?

18:39.885 --> 18:40.943
Get out!

18:47.559 --> 18:48.992
Hey, sweetie.

18:50.329 --> 18:51.660
Paul?

18:52.731 --> 18:56.497
- What's wrong?
- This is a bad place.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.438
- I'm mad at you. Something you said.
- What?

19:00.506 --> 19:02.599
"Let's start a family."

19:02.674 --> 19:04.801
It was a bunch of years ago.

19:04.877 --> 19:07.437
You wanted to keep going
till we had a boy.

19:07.513 --> 19:10.141
And the boy is fine.
It's the girls.

19:10.215 --> 19:14.379
The girls, they don't seem
to like me very much.

19:14.453 --> 19:16.717
Where did you go wrong, Cate?

19:17.789 --> 19:20.349
- So you had a rough day?
- Yes, I did.

19:20.425 --> 19:24.191
So are you saying that I had
the tougher job all these years?

19:24.263 --> 19:26.424
No. You had them
when they were cute.

19:26.498 --> 19:28.056
They've changed.

19:29.868 --> 19:33.235
Now, look, you're just
having problems adjusting to the fact

19:33.338 --> 19:35.465
that your daughters
are becoming women.

19:35.541 --> 19:38.442
That is ridiculous.
They are not becoming women.

19:38.510 --> 19:42.674
Hey, you still have Rory, the boy.

19:42.748 --> 19:47.776
He's gonna get older and you guys
can hang out at Hooters and drink beers

19:47.853 --> 19:49.718
and come on to waitresses.

19:50.789 --> 19:53.349
- That's true.
- There you go.

19:55.327 --> 19:57.955
But I want the girls to love me too.

19:58.630 --> 20:01.098
I know.

20:01.166 --> 20:05.830
Hey, Paul, whatever's
going on in their lives,

20:05.904 --> 20:09.806
you just have to trust
that they love you too.

20:10.542 --> 20:14.034
- Yeah, I guess.
- Mom? Dad?

20:14.112 --> 20:17.479
I'm really sorry for ditching school.
I won't do it again.

20:17.549 --> 20:19.073
- Good.
- Glad to hear it.

20:19.151 --> 20:20.175
I'll walk you up.

20:27.092 --> 20:28.252
Good night.

20:30.095 --> 20:32.188
You must have done something right.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.235
Whoa.

20:41.039 --> 20:44.372
- To what do I owe this honor?
- Daddy?

20:44.443 --> 20:46.673
Oh, God, what do you want?

20:47.713 --> 20:51.979
How about I'm only grounded for a week?
Six days. I didn't go anywhere good.

20:52.050 --> 20:54.985
- Cate!
- I'm going with the boy you want,

20:55.053 --> 20:57.021
- which is like being grounded.
- Cate!

20:57.122 --> 20:58.282
You know, Lindsey...

21:01.193 --> 21:02.285
Hi, Dad.

21:03.195 --> 21:04.924
Hey, where's your shroud?

21:04.997 --> 21:08.125
- A friend's coming over.
- A boy?

21:08.200 --> 21:10.100
Yeah. Is it OK?

21:10.168 --> 21:12.227
To see you light up like this?
Sure.

21:12.304 --> 21:15.796
- [doorbell rings]
- He's here! I'm not ready.

21:19.011 --> 21:20.569
Hi, I'm Jesse.

21:20.679 --> 21:23.409
- Chatroom Jesse?
- Yeah.

21:23.482 --> 21:24.779
Hey, is Kerry here?

21:25.484 --> 21:27.008
Mmm... No!
