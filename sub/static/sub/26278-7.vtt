There were several reports, sir.

00:47.588 --> 00:49.838
But there was some confusion

00:49.878 --> 00:53.380
as to whether people
heard one shot or two.

00:53.405 --> 00:56.886
Now, this is where the
call about the body came in.

00:56.921 --> 00:58.888
A police call box.

- Did the caller identify themselves?
- No, sir.

Sounds like the Hog's Head

01:09.007 --> 01:13.220
Why do people do this,
George? And why the 'wah hoo'?

01:13.249 --> 01:15.266
Well, there are several variants, sir.

01:15.291 --> 01:17.790
There is 'wah hoo', 'yeah hoo'.

01:17.804 --> 01:20.944

02:00.246 --> 02:02.904
It's just a graze, you're very lucky.

02:02.974 --> 02:05.438
If I was lucky, the dead
man would be under arrest

02:05.453 --> 02:06.968
and I would be unscathed.

02:07.022 --> 02:10.173
I think given how events played
out, I was rather unlucky.

02:10.342 --> 02:13.243
Yes. How did events play out?

02:13.695 --> 02:16.532
I came upon him
unexpectedly in the alley.

02:16.547 --> 02:19.815
He was drunk and belligerent.
I tried to avoid him, but

02:20.123 --> 02:21.986
he came straight at me.

02:22.011 --> 02:23.502
How frightening.

02:23.541 --> 02:25.037
He drew a pistol from his coat.

02:25.057 --> 02:29.259
As I lifted my arm to block
the shot, he pulled the trigger.

02:29.293 --> 02:30.934
What happened then?

02:31.605 --> 02:35.340
We fought for control of
the weapon and it discharged.

02:35.355 --> 02:37.173
I tried to save him,

02:37.198 --> 02:39.636
but he died within seconds.

02:42.966 --> 02:45.575
I'd never killed anyone before.

(MURDOCH): And you say
you didn't know this man?

03:02.727 --> 03:05.611
- Not that I'm aware.
- Did he recognize you?

03:05.665 --> 03:07.263
I don't know.

03:07.597 --> 03:09.265
What are you thinking, Murdoch?

03:09.300 --> 03:12.480
Well, I would certainly
like to know his motive.

03:12.605 --> 03:14.815
What motive? He was
drunk and belligerent.

03:14.885 --> 03:17.880
Sir, the man drew a pistol and shot.

03:17.920 --> 03:21.676
Agreed. It was more than the
average Saturday night donnybrook.

03:22.535 --> 03:24.189
Do you remember anything else?

03:24.462 --> 03:27.677
What he said? How he looked at you?

03:27.711 --> 03:30.931
My only true memories
are scattered impressions.

Oh, yes. Of course he's the victim.

- Get your mind off this.
- Yes. I think that's best.

03:58.655 --> 04:01.685
Julia, could you oversee this one?

04:01.700 --> 04:04.991
- It's not that I don't trust Miss Hart.
- I understand.

04:05.059 --> 04:07.209
- I'll let her know.
- Thank you.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

04:16.630 --> 04:18.666
- What have you, George?
- Sir.

04:18.702 --> 04:21.345
I've identified two sets of
fingermarks on the weapon.

04:21.421 --> 04:23.049
Detective Watts and the victim?

04:23.058 --> 04:25.645
That's correct. I found four casings.

04:25.661 --> 04:28.579
Two had been fired, two
bullets were still in there.

04:28.599 --> 04:30.356
The only slightly odd thing about that

04:30.386 --> 04:32.850
is this revolver is built to take five.

04:33.021 --> 04:35.997
Other than that, I lifted
a partial thumbmark,

04:36.009 --> 04:37.706
but it belongs to neither man.

04:38.266 --> 04:40.266
The gun could have been
borrowed, I suppose.

04:40.277 --> 04:41.489
Or stolen.

04:42.169 --> 04:44.152
Good point. He's likely a criminal.

04:44.589 --> 04:47.220
Check the photographs. We
have a city-wide directory now.

- Sir.

04:53.734 --> 04:57.024
- Have I lost your confidence, Detective?
- Miss Hart.

04:57.047 --> 04:59.965
You yourself have in fact
complimented me on my abilities.

05:00.569 --> 05:02.560
A police detective has killed a man,

05:02.568 --> 05:04.581
under suspicious circumstances.

05:04.785 --> 05:08.179
It's not my trust at issue.
It's the trust of the mayor,

05:08.362 --> 05:10.487
the chief constable, the public.

05:10.647 --> 05:12.689
I see your abilities.

05:13.429 --> 05:17.546
They see a young, inexperienced
woman who is not yet a doctor.

05:18.639 --> 05:20.706
- (JULIA): Let's begin, shall we?
- Yes.

05:20.912 --> 05:23.142
Powder burns on wound
opening are consistent

05:23.165 --> 05:24.560
with Detective Watts' account.

05:24.731 --> 05:26.786
Very close range, within inches.

05:26.801 --> 05:28.665
The bullet has yet to be extracted,

05:28.681 --> 05:31.376
but the opening is consistent
with a 38 caliber weapon.

05:31.682 --> 05:33.212
As for the time of death,

05:33.268 --> 05:35.775
rectal temperature
recorded at 93 degrees.

05:35.803 --> 05:38.151
Ambient temperature
recorded at 62 degrees

05:38.175 --> 05:41.017
- and diminishing at a rate...
- Your estimate is all I require.

05:41.859 --> 05:44.287
I wanted to be sure
Dr. Ogden was confident.

05:44.589 --> 05:47.650
I have complete confidence in
your method of calculations.

05:48.036 --> 05:49.359
Time of death?

05:49.712 --> 05:52.128
Midnight, give or take 30 minutes.

05:52.379 --> 05:54.577
Is that in accordance
with your expectations?

05:54.584 --> 05:56.234
It is. Thank you.

06:09.731 --> 06:11.381
For Pete's sake!

06:12.152 --> 06:14.219
Higgins! Wake up!

06:14.624 --> 06:16.441
It's Higgins-Newsome, if you don't mind.

06:16.489 --> 06:18.956
Higgins, that's the third time
you've nodded off this week.

06:18.968 --> 06:20.880
Is married life really so boisterous?

06:21.254 --> 06:22.709
It's not that.

06:22.834 --> 06:24.994
- I took a second job.
- You?

06:25.292 --> 06:28.475
- You barely have enough energy for one.
- I know.

06:28.721 --> 06:30.426
But it's been hard on Ruth.

06:30.441 --> 06:32.023
She's not used to penury of the sort

06:32.039 --> 06:33.596
that you and I are accustomed too.

06:33.721 --> 06:36.259
Her hairdressing bill
alone is half my wage.

06:36.507 --> 06:38.652
Well, maybe she should
start doing her own hair.

06:38.922 --> 06:41.649
I don't know, George. She's
already given up truffles

06:41.665 --> 06:44.037
- and her chocolate delivery service...
- Chocolate...

06:44.073 --> 06:45.916
Right then, what's
this job you've taken?

06:46.000 --> 06:47.304
Night watchman.

06:47.689 --> 06:49.870
- Sounds easy enough.
- I thought so too!

06:49.995 --> 06:51.937
I was hoping I'd be
able to sleep there, but

06:51.977 --> 06:53.360
they've got these hellish new machines

06:53.372 --> 06:55.287
that I have to punch
every hour on my rounds.

06:55.318 --> 06:57.390
Well, you can't sleep
here either, Higgins.

06:57.422 --> 06:58.654
If you're going to have another job,

06:58.666 --> 07:00.438
it should be one that
has you home by bedtime.

07:00.462 --> 07:02.990
- There are none.
- That's bollocks. I've been looking for a mechanic

07:03.000 --> 07:04.616
for the auto repair shop for weeks now.

07:04.624 --> 07:07.115
There are plenty of jobs if
you're a mechanic or a doctor.

07:07.137 --> 07:09.042
I have no skills.

07:09.376 --> 07:10.942
Maybe you need to get some.

07:11.067 --> 07:13.418
Or better yet, invent your own job.

07:13.466 --> 07:15.484
Should I invent someone
to pay my wages too?

07:15.500 --> 07:17.777
Higgins. What do people want?

07:17.833 --> 07:21.676
What can you supply?
What are you good at?

07:22.753 --> 07:24.012
I'm a good singer.

07:24.227 --> 07:25.542
Anything but that.

07:25.841 --> 07:29.088
I once won a contest for
reciting the alphabet backwards.

07:29.260 --> 07:33.431
Higgins. You are also the
co-owner of an automobile.

07:33.892 --> 07:36.471
That just gets me to the
job that I don't have faster.

07:36.511 --> 07:38.744
Yes, but perhaps it
could get other people

07:38.764 --> 07:40.154
to where they need to go.

07:40.429 --> 07:41.617
Like a cabbie?

07:42.344 --> 07:44.007
A motorized cabbie.

07:44.859 --> 07:46.509
How do I get customers?

07:46.794 --> 07:49.123
Drive down the street
yelling, "Cabbie for hire?"

07:49.215 --> 07:51.862
You could. Or you could advertise

07:52.235 --> 07:55.311
and you could get one of
those messaging services

07:55.335 --> 07:56.944
to dispatch your calls.

07:57.069 --> 07:58.158
Huh.

07:58.710 --> 07:59.838
Maybe.

08:02.559 --> 08:04.420
Wait a minute, Higgins. Turn back.

08:04.643 --> 08:05.732
What?

08:07.432 --> 08:08.831
That's him.

08:08.998 --> 08:10.063
Who?

08:10.476 --> 08:13.349
That's our victim, Higgins.
You fell asleep on him.

08:14.038 --> 08:15.518
Nigel Baker.

08:15.643 --> 08:18.541
Murderer, recently released.

08:21.094 --> 08:23.455
That's him. That's my son, dear God.

08:24.512 --> 08:26.551
I'm sorry for your loss, Mr. Baker.

08:27.473 --> 08:29.544
(MURDOCH): When did
you last see your son?

08:30.994 --> 08:33.998
We were at Hog's Head
Tavern with his friends.

08:35.484 --> 08:37.126
We were celebrating his release.

08:37.965 --> 08:40.695
He left shortly before I
did. About eleven o'clock.

08:43.583 --> 08:45.889
Your son attacked and shot

08:45.900 --> 08:47.538
- a police detective.
- What?

08:47.554 --> 08:50.359
And he was killed in
the ensuing struggle.

08:52.176 --> 08:53.816
How? Who?

08:54.107 --> 08:55.720
A Detective Watts.

08:56.181 --> 08:58.981
- Does that name sound familiar?
- No.

08:59.309 --> 09:01.244
Can you think of any reason why your son

09:01.264 --> 09:02.607
would do something like this?

09:03.688 --> 09:06.606
My son wasn't treated
very fairly by the police.

09:06.829 --> 09:09.885
- He was convicted on bad evidence.
- Yes.

09:10.059 --> 09:12.345
But the conviction was overturned.

09:12.377 --> 09:14.638
He was out on the street, a free man.

09:14.678 --> 09:17.142
But he still lost
four years of his life.

09:17.381 --> 09:20.102
Hardly a reason to shoot
at a police officer.

09:21.938 --> 09:24.852
I know you're trying to understand
what happened, Detective.

09:25.468 --> 09:27.472
I'm sorry I can't help you.

09:29.872 --> 09:31.668
It doesn't make sense.

09:31.727 --> 09:33.293
That's the trouble with you, Murdoch.

09:33.305 --> 09:35.360
You insist on the world making sense.

09:35.388 --> 09:37.248
Sir, people don't just go around

09:37.254 --> 09:39.546
shooting someone they
don't know for no reason.

09:39.593 --> 09:41.251
What if he just wanted to?

09:42.578 --> 09:45.791
- What have you, George?
- Sir, a case file for Nigel Baker.

09:45.806 --> 09:48.732
Apparently, he was some sort
of gang leader in the west end.

09:48.767 --> 09:51.033
- Reputed to be ruthless.
- West end.

09:51.068 --> 09:52.785
That's Watts old stomping ground.

09:52.910 --> 09:54.657
I'm surprised he didn't recognize him.

09:54.955 --> 09:57.983
George, that murder
conviction, who was the victim?

09:58.603 --> 10:00.971
Sir, this man.

10:01.945 --> 10:03.670
Daniel Marks. 20 years old.

10:03.710 --> 10:05.582
Lived in the same
neighbourhood as Baker.

10:05.613 --> 10:08.825
Apparently, Mr. Marks
had reported on a robbery

10:08.832 --> 10:11.038
that Nigel Baker had
committed, and presumably,

10:11.163 --> 10:13.005
Baker killed him in retaliation.

10:13.816 --> 10:16.669
I also found out Nigel Baker

10:16.693 --> 10:19.090
was at the Hog's Head
Tavern until 11:00.

10:19.102 --> 10:20.873
And by the time he
left, by all accounts,

10:20.895 --> 10:22.571
he was well into his cups.

10:22.647 --> 10:24.483
(PHONE RINGING)

10:26.796 --> 10:28.151
Detective Murdoch.

10:28.390 --> 10:30.941
You've determined the
fingermarks on the weapon

10:30.961 --> 10:34.100
- were from Mr. Baker's right hand, correct?
- Correct.

10:34.485 --> 10:36.402
And Detective Watts claims

10:36.421 --> 10:39.486
that the gun was still in
Baker's hand when it discharged?

10:39.611 --> 10:42.544
I believe they were both struggling
for control of the weapon.

10:43.029 --> 10:45.850
Well, Miss Hart has discovered
something quite interesting.

10:45.870 --> 10:46.963
Miss Hart?

10:47.758 --> 10:49.984
If what the detective said is true,

10:50.008 --> 10:52.647
the bullet would have traveled
from the victim's right

10:52.683 --> 10:54.431
to his left from the point of entry.

10:54.491 --> 10:57.093
But I tracked the path of the
bullet and found that it had in fact

10:57.105 --> 10:59.275
traveled from his left to his right.

11:03.392 --> 11:04.409
Right.

11:04.989 --> 11:06.158
You're Baker.

11:06.193 --> 11:07.453
You're trying to shoot me

11:07.469 --> 11:09.948
- and I'm trying to stop you.
- Mm-mm.

11:13.317 --> 11:15.738
(GRUNTING) Bam! Haha!

11:16.346 --> 11:19.164
- Bloody hell, Higgins!
- Are you all right, sir?

11:19.561 --> 11:20.864
Henry...

11:21.091 --> 11:24.115
We're trying to demonstrate
how the weapon discharged.

11:24.154 --> 11:26.514
Not engage in an actual fight!

11:26.757 --> 11:28.688
Sorry, sir, but it's
what he'd have done.

11:28.720 --> 11:30.087
One of them would have, sir.

11:30.095 --> 11:32.135
They were in a fight for
their lives, were they not?

11:32.169 --> 11:34.937
I hate to say it, but
he does have a point.

11:35.096 --> 11:36.407
Out the way, Higgins.

11:36.532 --> 11:40.038
Let the dog see the
rabbit. Right, then. So,

11:40.713 --> 11:43.548
what if Watts did give
him the knee? You're Baker.

11:43.989 --> 11:47.236
You're taken by surprise. Your
arm relaxes. I turn it around.

11:47.740 --> 11:50.551
Yes, sir, but at no point
does the gun come 'round

11:50.587 --> 11:53.555
far enough to shoot him from the left.

11:53.567 --> 11:56.225
So I have to wrest that
free to be able to do that.

11:57.390 --> 12:00.382
So, Watts had control of the
weapon when he shot Baker.

12:00.894 --> 12:02.511
Odd that he didn't mention that.

12:02.742 --> 12:04.825
Perhaps he thought it
was too incriminating.

12:05.659 --> 12:08.759
- That's what worries me.
- Sir, I just spoke to John.

12:08.942 --> 12:11.974
He said Watts was in a hurry when
he left the station last night.

12:12.022 --> 12:13.943
And he was heading for
the Hog's Head Tavern.

12:14.652 --> 12:16.985
That's where Nigel Baker
was drinking that night.

12:17.994 --> 12:19.807
Bring him in, Crabtree.

12:21.690 --> 12:23.971
- Put this away.
- Sir.

12:38.424 --> 12:40.646
Yes, I was going to The Hog's Head.***

12:40.904 --> 12:41.918
Why?

12:41.954 --> 12:44.242
A man claimed he had information for me.

12:44.290 --> 12:46.475
- Regarding?
- He didn't say.

12:46.495 --> 12:49.499
Nor did he give me his name,
if that's what you're wondering.

12:50.679 --> 12:52.718
Could it have been Nigel Baker?

12:53.588 --> 12:55.671
Are you thinking I was lured there?

12:57.420 --> 13:00.393
- Did you know Nigel Baker?
- I knew of him.

13:00.422 --> 13:03.238
He was one of those trouble
makers from St. Patrick Square.

13:03.254 --> 13:04.637
There was a gang of them.

13:05.122 --> 13:07.049
Last I heard, he'd been convicted

13:07.077 --> 13:09.088
of murdering a young man
from the neighbourhood.

13:09.267 --> 13:11.886
Yes. The conviction had been overturned.

13:12.395 --> 13:14.199
I should have known that, I suppose.

13:14.644 --> 13:16.993
Do you recall the Daniel Marks case?

13:17.005 --> 13:19.536
Of course. I was just
a constable at the time,

13:19.564 --> 13:22.234
- but I took an interest.
- Did you work the case?

13:22.564 --> 13:25.060
No. Not directly.

13:25.087 --> 13:27.218
Although we all helped out.

13:27.715 --> 13:30.147
It was outrageous, what
he did to that poor man.

13:30.198 --> 13:33.306
- Did you know Daniel Marks?
- Not to speak to.

13:33.431 --> 13:35.666
He lived up on William Street.

13:35.992 --> 13:39.415
So, you had no particular
grievance with Nigel Baker?

13:41.183 --> 13:43.770
Are you asking if I shot him on purpose?

13:44.589 --> 13:46.636
Whose hand was around the pistol

13:46.660 --> 13:48.571
- when it discharged?
- His.

13:48.984 --> 13:50.276
Are you certain?

13:51.779 --> 13:53.527
Of course I'm not certain.

13:53.730 --> 13:56.524
Memories are fragmentary
impressions at best.

13:56.536 --> 13:59.504
The mind moves like
a flock of starlings.

13:59.532 --> 14:02.561
It's hard to pin down a
thought, let alone a memory.

14:03.431 --> 14:04.631
Why are you asking?

14:04.655 --> 14:07.314
Have you found a
discrepancy in my account?

14:07.663 --> 14:10.207
Nigel Baker was shot from the left side.

14:10.274 --> 14:13.072
And you want to know
if I wrested the gun

14:13.088 --> 14:14.944
from his grasp and then shot him?

14:15.496 --> 14:16.752
Yes.

14:17.765 --> 14:20.030
If that's what the evidence shows,

14:20.058 --> 14:21.541
that must be what happened.

14:22.415 --> 14:24.680
What I can tell you
with absolute certainty

14:24.708 --> 14:27.744
is that I did not shoot Nigel
Baker with malice aforethought.

14:28.388 --> 14:31.337
I'm not sure Detective
Watts is capable of lying.

14:31.462 --> 14:33.618
Even to save someone's feelings.

14:34.099 --> 14:35.426
In my experience,

14:35.462 --> 14:38.805
anyone is capable of lying if
the incentive is strong enough.

14:39.349 --> 14:41.388
- Have you ever lied to me?
- Never.

14:41.424 --> 14:42.691
Is that a lie?

14:43.613 --> 14:47.369
I suppose it's possible, but
I honestly can't remember.

They wrestled for a gun,
and Watts killed him.

- Yes, but

I'll be happy to help you,

17:04.487 --> 17:08.242
I want to know why your son's
conviction was overturned.

17:08.307 --> 17:10.632
Because all of the evidence
they used to convict him

17:10.646 --> 17:12.579
was manufactured by the police.

17:12.772 --> 17:14.098
How so?

17:14.134 --> 17:17.338
All of the evidence they had
on Nigel was circumstantial,

17:17.353 --> 17:19.433
except for what they claimed
to be the murder weapon.

17:19.470 --> 17:22.336
- Which was?
- A knife. My son's.

17:22.539 --> 17:25.887
He never denied owning
it. He had it for years.

17:26.305 --> 17:29.186
And how did they determine
this to be the murder weapon?

17:29.216 --> 17:32.742
There was a thumbmark on the blade
that belonged to Daniel Marks.

17:33.676 --> 17:36.095
- Well, that would be damning.
- And it was.

17:36.220 --> 17:38.033
But Nigel was adamant

17:38.495 --> 17:40.779
that the police put the
thumbmark on the knife.

17:40.829 --> 17:42.799
My son was never above
evading the truth,

17:42.801 --> 17:45.047
but I could tell that he
wasn't lying this time.

17:45.777 --> 17:49.274
And so, we got a court order
to re-examine the weapon

17:49.507 --> 17:51.310
and we found that the victim's thumbmark

17:51.330 --> 17:53.461
was indeed on the murder weapon.

17:56.218 --> 17:58.478
It was from the wrong hand, Detective!

17:59.254 --> 18:02.293

remember the disputed evidence,

he was the reason it was
disputed in the first place.

18:23.133 --> 18:25.552

- Apparently,

18:26.014 --> 18:27.574
the victim's right thumbmark

18:27.589 --> 18:30.157
was found on the blade
of Nigel Baker's knife.

18:30.282 --> 18:31.737
Yes, I've heard the same.

18:31.787 --> 18:35.229
Right. And a deep gash on
Daniel's right hand suggested

18:35.259 --> 18:38.477
he had grabbed the knife trying
to prevent further attack.

18:38.735 --> 18:41.289
With that evidence, they had
Nigel Baker dead to rights.

18:41.319 --> 18:42.700
So, what happened?

18:43.013 --> 18:46.257
So, Constable Baxter
is cataloging evidence.

18:46.272 --> 18:48.179
He has the knife there, on his desk.

18:48.199 --> 18:51.265
There's some sort of melee
outside and he goes to help.

18:51.284 --> 18:52.819
By the time he gets back,

18:52.834 --> 18:55.587
the thumbmark has been
wiped clean of the blade.

18:55.632 --> 18:58.016
And without the thumbmark,
there would be no way to prove

18:58.021 --> 19:01.454
- it was the murder weapon.
- Baxter was beside himself, but

19:02.950 --> 19:05.007
another constable told him

19:05.067 --> 19:06.860
he would take care of it.

19:09.070 --> 19:10.809
I should have told you.

19:11.112 --> 19:13.128
You replaced the thumbmark.

19:13.153 --> 19:16.388
It wasn't difficult. The victim's
corpse was still in the morgue.

19:16.472 --> 19:18.822
Clearly a bit more difficult
than you had thought.

19:18.837 --> 19:21.072
You replaced it with the wrong thumb.

19:22.190 --> 19:25.683
I get left-right mixed
up. Same with East-West.

19:25.703 --> 19:28.023
Up-down, North-South, I'm quite good at.

19:28.148 --> 19:30.184
Why would you take such a risk?

19:30.551 --> 19:32.821
To the case? To yourself?

19:33.070 --> 19:34.679
Because it was my fault.

19:34.714 --> 19:38.027
I was the one who told Constable
Baxter to leave his desk.

19:39.035 --> 19:41.479
To aid with the melee outside?

19:41.604 --> 19:43.819
Baker's boys had started it, obviously.

19:43.829 --> 19:46.467
It was an idiot trap
and I was the idiot.

19:46.839 --> 19:48.324
I had to make it right.

19:50.594 --> 19:54.300
It wasn't right, of course.
It destroyed the case.

19:54.936 --> 19:57.305
And it's now destroyed my career.

19:58.880 --> 20:00.499
He fixed evidence?

20:00.529 --> 20:03.311
That would explain why
he seemed so evasive.

20:03.845 --> 20:05.467
He didn't want us to find out.

20:05.487 --> 20:07.320
Well, you can't blame him for that.

20:08.083 --> 20:09.650
It'll mean the end of his job.

20:09.685 --> 20:13.679
It also explains why
Nigel Baker attacked him.

20:14.356 --> 20:16.729
How did Baker know that Watts
would go down that alley?

20:16.749 --> 20:18.994
It's the shortest distance
from Station House Four.

20:19.019 --> 20:20.862
It saves him having to
go down to Queen Street.

20:20.877 --> 20:24.206
So, Nigel Baker called Watts and
lured him to the Hog's Head Tavern.

20:24.419 --> 20:25.854
He then confronted him en route,

20:25.874 --> 20:28.681
no doubt intending to return to
the tavern to secure his alibi.

20:28.806 --> 20:30.186
Sirs.

20:30.216 --> 20:32.516
I just spoke to Constable Baxter.

20:32.987 --> 20:36.132
There is no way Watts put that
thumbmark back on the knife blade.

20:36.182 --> 20:39.188
- Why's that?
- Watts said he got that thumbmark from the morgue.

20:39.217 --> 20:40.727
But he couldn't have. By that time,

20:40.757 --> 20:43.738
the body had already been transported
to the funeral home for burial.

20:43.812 --> 20:45.264
Why would he lie about that?

20:45.298 --> 20:47.094
I don't know, but I
telephoned the mortician

20:47.106 --> 20:48.628

He said the only people who
would have access to that body

22:50.855 --> 22:52.394
No, I'm not.

To be honest, even if given
the chance to exact my revenge,

was something wrong with him.

24:36.474 --> 24:38.203
George, on the night of the shooting,

24:38.228 --> 24:40.727
you said there was confusion
about how many shots were heard.

24:40.757 --> 24:43.071
That's right. Most people heard two.

24:43.086 --> 24:44.338
Some only heard one. And then,

24:44.363 --> 24:46.494
there was an elderly lady
who said she heard three,

24:46.509 --> 24:48.124
but she might have been a bit daft.

24:48.474 --> 24:51.447

were fired that night.

some people reported hearing
one shot. Others, two.

25:25.767 --> 25:28.151
And one person reported hearing three.

25:28.186 --> 25:30.381
Is this a riddle, Detective?

25:33.858 --> 25:35.582
Can you explain it?

25:36.302 --> 25:40.008
All right. One shot was separated
in time from the other two.

25:40.023 --> 25:42.100
Only one person heard all three.

25:42.120 --> 25:44.117
No reason to think the two are related.

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

35:12.567 --> 35:15.547
So? Am I to assume you have your proof?

35:16.958 --> 35:18.364
You had a theory.

35:18.379 --> 35:20.614
Oh, I've since changed my theory.

35:20.679 --> 35:24.235
I no longer believe Hubert
Marks killed Nigel Baker.

35:24.360 --> 35:25.979
No, that was you.

35:26.158 --> 35:29.144
Well... Good. That's what
I've been saying all along.

35:29.269 --> 35:31.399
But I don't believe it was self defense.

35:32.005 --> 35:33.450
It was murder.

35:34.608 --> 35:36.639
- What?
- We found this in a shed

35:36.664 --> 35:39.029
near where you confronted Nigel Baker.

35:42.317 --> 35:44.110
I believe you were there that night.

35:44.125 --> 35:45.834
You've since changed your shoes,

35:45.849 --> 35:48.288
but that's your bloody footprint.

35:49.778 --> 35:51.382
Whose blood?

36:05.377 --> 36:06.783
No.

36:07.072 --> 36:08.761
No.

36:09.574 --> 36:10.856
No!

36:12.491 --> 36:14.186
NO!

36:18.119 --> 36:19.857
Do you think it was an act?

36:20.255 --> 36:22.530
No, sir. I don't believe it was.

36:22.913 --> 36:25.084
He really didn't know Hubert was dead?

36:26.639 --> 36:29.674
I thought it best to leave him
alone with his grief for a time

36:29.689 --> 36:31.403
before I question him any further.

36:31.528 --> 36:34.131
Poor bugger. What a way to find out.

36:35.142 --> 36:38.422
So, if Watts didn't kill
Nigel Baker and Hubert didn't,

36:38.467 --> 36:40.121
then who the bloody hell did?

36:48.543 --> 36:50.401
I'm sorry for your loss.

36:50.435 --> 36:53.336
And the manner in
which you learned of it.

36:55.160 --> 36:57.470
You should have stuck
with your first theory.

36:57.748 --> 36:59.517
You were right about everything.

37:00.178 --> 37:01.891
Except Hubert.

37:02.487 --> 37:04.171
You were wrong about that.

37:05.234 --> 37:08.190
You thought Hubert had
killed Nigel and then fled?

37:09.462 --> 37:12.959
Before you brought me back
in, I went to his room.

37:13.180 --> 37:16.302
His landlady told me he'd
packed up the night before.

37:17.539 --> 37:18.925
He'd planned it all out.

37:18.940 --> 37:22.005
He was going to kill
Nigel and then flee.

37:23.878 --> 37:26.481
So when I learned that
wasn't the truth of it...

37:32.274 --> 37:34.882
When Danny was killed,
Hubert was broken.

37:35.007 --> 37:37.366
They'd always had each other.

37:38.350 --> 37:42.314
Danny was the funny one.
Always cracking jokes.

37:43.630 --> 37:45.603
Hubert went into a hole.

37:46.527 --> 37:48.399
He was going to kill Nigel then.

37:48.424 --> 37:51.311
I promised him that
justice would be done

37:51.326 --> 37:53.154
and I saw to that. (SNIFFLING)

37:54.033 --> 37:55.737
We both did.

37:57.669 --> 38:01.216
It was Hubert that replaced the
fingermark on Nigel Baker's knife.

38:01.341 --> 38:03.928
I couldn't take the chance of
being seen alone with the corpse.

38:03.933 --> 38:06.685
As soon as the thumbmark
magically reappeared,

38:06.710 --> 38:08.418
they would have gone searching.

38:08.935 --> 38:10.356
And they did.

38:10.783 --> 38:13.555
And Nigel convinced his
father to petition the courts

38:13.580 --> 38:15.338
to re-examine the evidence.

38:16.890 --> 38:19.846
That's when they found the
thumbmark came from the wrong hand.

38:21.669 --> 38:24.381
Hubert never could tell left from right.

38:25.066 --> 38:28.687
One bad piece of evidence
can taint the whole case.

38:29.462 --> 38:31.643
So they threw out the conviction.

38:32.058 --> 38:33.536
They had to.

38:34.967 --> 38:36.710
(SNIFFLING)

38:37.619 --> 38:38.911
So,

38:39.229 --> 38:41.320
who did kill Nigel Baker?

38:42.001 --> 38:43.566
I don't know.

Come on.

38:57.450 --> 38:59.472
(DOOR OPENS)

38:59.705 --> 39:02.408
We know that Hubert
wanted to confront Nigel.

39:02.591 --> 39:04.842
And we know how that
confrontation ended.

39:04.892 --> 39:06.611
Someone in his own gang, maybe?

39:06.854 --> 39:09.612
Nigel gets out of jail,
tries to retake control.

39:09.627 --> 39:12.895
He was killed with Hubert's
gun. I recognized it.

39:13.710 --> 39:17.177
Whoever killed Nigel was with
Nigel when he killed Hubert

39:17.182 --> 39:19.577
or happened on the scene shortly after.

39:19.840 --> 39:21.723
Hubert wouldn't have confronted Nigel

39:21.758 --> 39:23.169
if he was with someone else.

39:23.407 --> 39:27.340
According to witnesses, Nigel Baker
left the Hog's Head Tavern alone.

39:27.558 --> 39:29.863
Why would he have gone down
that alley in the first place?

39:29.917 --> 39:33.146
It's a short cut between
Soho and Williams street.

39:33.206 --> 39:34.760
That's where Nigel lived.

39:35.371 --> 39:36.812
Who else knows this?

39:37.023 --> 39:39.559
Everybody who lives on Williams street.

39:39.684 --> 39:43.434
It's their family home. His
father still lives there.

39:44.353 --> 39:48.184
His father stated that he left the
Hog's Head shortly after his son.

39:50.170 --> 39:52.556
And he seemed more shocked at the how

39:52.576 --> 39:54.974
than the fact that his
son had been murdered.

39:56.320 --> 39:59.052
He would have taken
the same shortcut home.

I always knew that Nigel
possessed a hard soul...

40:34.739 --> 40:39.881
... but I was blind to
the depths of his cruelty.

40:41.639 --> 40:44.658
You believed him to be innocent
of Daniel Marks' murder?

40:45.538 --> 40:49.737
He insisted that the thumbmark had
been placed there by the police.

40:50.858 --> 40:53.377
And when we learned that was the truth,

40:54.097 --> 40:57.225
yes, Detective, I believed
my son was innocent.

40:59.072 --> 41:00.916
It was my doing,

41:02.721 --> 41:07.410
and my tireless advocacy that
unleashed... unleashed him

41:38.728 --> 41:40.934
There are wheels that can fly?

But you said yourself that
I have more aptitude for this

than you had thought
possible. That is true.

41:48.723 --> 41:50.733
The rest is just training, isn't it?

I tell you what. Half-a-buck
per shift until you know

41:54.633 --> 41:56.412
what you're doing and then,
we'll bump it up from there.

41:56.436 --> 41:58.990
Thank you, George. I
really appreciate this.

Alright, Higgins, but you
can't be your lazy normal self.

The thing-a-ma-bob, by the way, Higgins,

42:12.428 --> 42:14.892
- is the fly wheel.
- Alright, where is it?

42:14.907 --> 42:17.177
- Here.
- And how does it work?

I'm not taking your
bloody badge. Put it back.

42:22.811 --> 42:25.141
If I do, you will be as guilty as I.

I too once faced a choice
between duty and conscience.

I also chose the latter.

We're only bloody human, Watts.

42:33.715 --> 42:35.890
When we're wronged, we seek justice.

I've been asking myself that.

To be honest, I'm unable
to think of much else.

42:44.604 --> 42:46.019
You seek justice.

42:46.144 --> 42:49.070
I crave it. If I could,
I would demand it.

42:49.104 --> 42:52.502
I want the man who killed my
brothers to feel their pain.

42:53.098 --> 42:55.572
To feel my grief at what he did to them.

Did he even know why?

And now, the father will likely hang.

Is that justice?

Of a sort, I suppose.
