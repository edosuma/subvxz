00:03.086 --> 00:04.045
-Janet.

00:03.086 --> 00:04.045
-Hmm?

00:04.087 --> 00:06.047
Look.

00:06.089 --> 00:08.717
-[Janet] Cool.

00:06.089 --> 00:08.717
-Not cool, dangerous.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.512
Every day he do like this.

00:11.553 --> 00:13.597
One day, he knock over chip.

00:13.639 --> 00:16.183
Other day, he almost hit

00:13.639 --> 00:16.183
Mr. Chin.

00:16.224 --> 00:18.268
Funny, but they're dangerous.

00:18.727 --> 00:19.812
Hey.

00:19.854 --> 00:21.104
-Hey.

00:21.146 --> 00:23.064
I think you're overreacting.

00:23.106 --> 00:27.277
When I was a boy in Korea,

00:23.106 --> 00:27.277
one student came to school

00:23.106 --> 00:27.277
every day on roller skate.

00:27.319 --> 00:30.071
Everybody tease,

00:27.319 --> 00:30.071
but he not care.

00:30.113 --> 00:32.449
He love to glide around,

00:32.491 --> 00:36.286
feel wind in his hair, do all

00:32.491 --> 00:36.286
kinds of roller skate trick.

00:36.328 --> 00:39.247
Grapevine, snake walk,

00:36.328 --> 00:39.247
shoot the duck!

00:39.289 --> 00:42.459
But then one boy

00:39.289 --> 00:42.459
tease him out of his dream.

00:42.501 --> 00:45.128
-That's terrible.

00:42.501 --> 00:45.128
Do you miss it?

00:42.501 --> 00:45.128
-Miss what?

00:45.170 --> 00:47.840
-Roller skating.

00:45.170 --> 00:47.840
-I not roller skate boy,

00:47.882 --> 00:50.467
I am boy who teased

00:47.882 --> 00:50.467
the roller skate boy.

00:50.509 --> 00:52.093
-And I miss that.

00:50.509 --> 00:52.093
-Appa!

00:52.135 --> 00:55.263
-What?

00:52.135 --> 00:55.263
-He stopped roller skating

00:52.135 --> 00:55.263
and became heart surgeon.

00:55.305 --> 00:57.516
Saved hundreds of lives

00:55.305 --> 00:57.516
because of me.

00:58.099 --> 00:59.476
Whoa!

01:02.604 --> 01:05.566
Hey, there's a bunch of gravel

01:02.604 --> 01:05.566
back there for some reason.

01:05.607 --> 01:07.275
-You okay?

01:05.607 --> 01:07.275
-Yeah, I'm fine.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.028
Oh.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.114
[entrance bell chiming]

01:13.156 --> 01:14.992
Tomorrow I use oil.

01:15.034 --> 01:17.077
[theme music playing]

01:35.178 --> 01:36.513
...but then see,

01:36.555 --> 01:38.057
zip, zip,

01:39.140 --> 01:40.976
now these short-pants.

01:41.018 --> 01:42.185
What will they think of next?

01:42.937 --> 01:44.145
Hopefully nothing.

01:44.187 --> 01:47.106
There's a combo

01:44.187 --> 01:47.106
shorts and pants.

01:47.148 --> 01:49.944
Or what I call, "ports." Mmm.

01:49.985 --> 01:53.614
Well, clearly you like them

01:49.985 --> 01:53.614
and that's the important thing.

01:53.655 --> 01:56.157
-Tsk tsk.

01:53.655 --> 01:56.157
-Oh, Mr. Mehta.

01:56.199 --> 01:58.118
Ah, Mrs. Kim.

01:58.911 --> 02:00.454
[chuckling]

02:01.622 --> 02:03.540
Oh, yeah. Okay.

02:03.582 --> 02:05.834
Uh, how is Mrs. Mehta?

02:05.876 --> 02:08.087
Oh, she's doing fine.

02:08.128 --> 02:11.339
Uh, we need to have you two over

02:08.128 --> 02:11.339
for a get-together some day.

02:11.381 --> 02:15.010
Oh, that would be nice,

02:11.381 --> 02:15.010
but, uh...

02:15.052 --> 02:17.178
Oh... Finding time is so...

02:17.220 --> 02:20.015
Rough. I mean, aggressive.

02:20.057 --> 02:23.644
-Challenging.

02:20.057 --> 02:23.644
-Yeah, okay.

02:20.057 --> 02:23.644
I have to go to salon. See ya.

02:25.020 --> 02:26.354
[entrance bell chiming]

02:27.898 --> 02:30.484
You see that?

02:27.898 --> 02:30.484
Pump-pump, smack-smack?

02:30.525 --> 02:32.987
-I saw no such thing,

02:30.525 --> 02:32.987
nor was I splashed by it.

02:30.525 --> 02:32.987
-[sighs]

02:33.028 --> 02:36.323
Most of time she

02:33.028 --> 02:36.323
do pretty style,

02:33.028 --> 02:36.323
but the lotion...

02:36.364 --> 02:37.699
Next time I say something.

02:37.741 --> 02:40.201
Absolutely not. Suicide mission!

02:40.243 --> 02:43.580
Hmm. But if there's a spinach

02:40.243 --> 02:43.580
in your wife's teeth,

02:40.243 --> 02:43.580
you not tell her?

02:43.622 --> 02:46.416
No! Nor do I mention

02:43.622 --> 02:46.416
her grey hairs.

02:46.458 --> 02:47.668
Or the mustache.

02:47.709 --> 02:50.712
But if she's doing all crazy

02:47.709 --> 02:50.712
like that.

02:50.754 --> 02:53.132
Have to say something.

02:50.754 --> 02:53.132
As helping her.

02:53.172 --> 02:56.343
You, sir, are the<i> Titanic,</i>

02:53.172 --> 02:56.343
sitting out on a doomed voyage.

02:56.384 --> 02:58.177
I still haven't

02:56.384 --> 02:58.177
seen the movie.

02:58.219 --> 03:00.973
It is the most stirring

02:58.219 --> 03:00.973
soundtrack Celine Dion

02:58.219 --> 03:00.973
has ever done.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.562
-[inhales sharply]

03:05.727 --> 03:07.562
Did you see it?

03:05.727 --> 03:07.562
-Mmm.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.773
It was so good. Dave and Jenna

03:07.604 --> 03:09.773
missing their flight!

03:09.815 --> 03:12.109
And then Sherry breaking

03:09.815 --> 03:12.109

03:12.151 --> 03:13.777
Oh, my God,

03:12.151 --> 03:13.777
is this<i> Astounding Trek?</i>

03:13.819 --> 03:16.321
-Don't say anything.

03:13.819 --> 03:16.321
I recorded it.

03:13.819 --> 03:16.321
-Best finale ever! [laughs]

03:16.363 --> 03:18.615
-When they

03:16.363 --> 03:18.615
crashed the rickshaw...

-[Shannon] Oh, they deserved it!

03:18.657 --> 03:21.035
Good job, guys!

03:18.657 --> 03:21.035
Now I know there's a rickshaw.

03:22.285 --> 03:23.370
Did you see they're

03:22.285 --> 03:23.370
taking audition tapes?

03:23.411 --> 03:24.955
I know.

03:23.411 --> 03:24.955
How much fun would that be?

03:24.997 --> 03:27.624
Um, very. And I'd kill it.

03:24.997 --> 03:27.624
I'm awesome under pressure.

03:27.666 --> 03:29.250
Remember when that wasp

03:27.666 --> 03:29.250
got in to the garage?

03:29.292 --> 03:31.252
That was like

03:29.292 --> 03:31.252
you had ice in your veins.

03:31.294 --> 03:33.421
And I'm really great at puzzles

03:31.294 --> 03:33.421
and I'm not afraid to take

03:31.294 --> 03:33.421
a melon to the face.

03:33.463 --> 03:36.050
And I almost speak Korean.

03:33.463 --> 03:36.050
We make a great team.

03:36.091 --> 03:37.718
-Yeah!

03:36.091 --> 03:37.718
-[chuckles]

03:41.304 --> 03:43.140
But maybe not right now.

03:43.182 --> 03:44.224
Yeah, another time.

03:50.981 --> 03:52.733
Let's go, Gerald,

03:50.981 --> 03:52.733
I want to beat the rush.

03:52.774 --> 03:55.276
-It's a tripod sale.

03:52.774 --> 03:55.276
-Yeah, less talking,

03:52.774 --> 03:55.276
more hustling.

03:55.318 --> 03:57.362
See, now, a lens cleaner sale,

03:55.318 --> 03:57.362
right, that's something

03:55.318 --> 03:57.362
I'd be...

03:58.321 --> 04:00.281
-Oh!

03:58.321 --> 04:00.281
-Gerald, you okay?

04:00.323 --> 04:02.283
Yeah, um, I think

04:00.323 --> 04:02.283
it's just a stitch.

04:02.325 --> 04:04.285
I must have pulled something

04:02.325 --> 04:04.285
last night in my bedroom.

04:04.327 --> 04:05.412
Oh, I don't want to know.

04:05.453 --> 04:07.288
-It's a workout video.

04:05.453 --> 04:07.288
-Oh.

04:07.330 --> 04:08.248
They help me sleep.

04:08.874 --> 04:10.291
Ow!

04:10.333 --> 04:12.293
-I... I think I might need

04:10.333 --> 04:12.293
to go to the hospital.

04:10.333 --> 04:12.293
-Really?

04:12.335 --> 04:13.336
Yeah.

04:13.378 --> 04:15.505
Fine. But you owe me a tripod.

04:15.547 --> 04:18.299
-Okay.

04:15.547 --> 04:18.299
-Um, here.

04:18.341 --> 04:21.302
-Seriously?

04:18.341 --> 04:21.302
-Yeah, dude, you and me

04:18.341 --> 04:21.302
trekking astoundingly.

04:21.344 --> 04:23.180
-We'll be like those guys.

04:21.344 --> 04:23.180
-What guys?

04:23.222 --> 04:25.682
You know, with the hair

04:23.222 --> 04:25.682
and nicknames,

04:23.222 --> 04:25.682
and the funny banter.

04:25.724 --> 04:28.309
-And they're like, "Uh-oh,

04:25.724 --> 04:28.309
we're lost, we'll never win."

04:25.724 --> 04:28.309
-[chuckles]

04:28.351 --> 04:30.270
But they do and people go nuts.

04:30.311 --> 04:31.646

04:30.311 --> 04:31.646
like those guys.

Just so you know, I don't like

04:31.688 --> 04:34.108
airports or weird smells.

04:34.149 --> 04:37.111
And if I don't have coffee

04:34.149 --> 04:37.111
every couple of hours,

04:34.149 --> 04:37.111
I get pretty sarcastic.

And maybe a men's magazine?

-Oh, copy that.

04:58.632 --> 05:01.760
know how long it might be

until we see someone?

05:01.802 --> 05:03.887
Not sure. Fill this out, please.

Speaking of change... [chuckles]

05:39.589 --> 05:42.092
I was, uh, thinking,

05:39.589 --> 05:42.092
maybe, Umma,

05:42.134 --> 05:45.929
you could change

05:42.134 --> 05:45.929
how you put on, um, lotion.

05:45.971 --> 05:47.430
Hmm. What you talking?

Just, uh, when you put

05:47.472 --> 05:50.475
on the lotion, uh,

-You think I'm not feminine?

06:06.200 --> 06:08.409
Of course you is a feminine,

even with your haircut.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.943
[groans] This is taking forever.

06:42.861 --> 06:44.196
Can we hurry it up, please?

06:44.238 --> 06:45.655
Our taxes pay your salary.

06:45.697 --> 06:47.448
We don't really pay taxes,

06:45.697 --> 06:47.448
we're students.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.450
-They don't know that.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.450
-You wrote it on the form.

06:51.286 --> 06:52.329
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.290
-Raj.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.290
-Hey.

06:56.499 --> 06:57.458
Hey.

07:03.506 --> 07:06.467
-Okay, let's do this!

07:03.506 --> 07:06.467
-What, now?

07:06.509 --> 07:09.470
Hey, check it.

07:06.509 --> 07:09.470
Got the guys at the print shop

07:06.509 --> 07:09.470
to do up these.

07:09.512 --> 07:12.099
Wow, so bright.

07:12.140 --> 07:15.602
Hey, do you want the foam finger

07:12.140 --> 07:15.602
or these bad boys?

07:16.519 --> 07:18.897
-It says we're goofballs.

07:16.519 --> 07:18.897
-Yup.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.233
Oh, and here.

07:21.275 --> 07:24.278
I mean,

07:21.275 --> 07:24.278
you can add a little bit,

07:21.275 --> 07:24.278
but better we stay on message.

07:25.195 --> 07:26.613
There's a lot of message here.

07:27.739 --> 07:30.033
-[phone beeps]

07:27.739 --> 07:30.033
-And action.

07:32.744 --> 07:33.870
You go first.

07:33.912 --> 07:35.414
-No, it says you are.

07:33.912 --> 07:35.414
-Right.

07:37.498 --> 07:39.500
Hey, I'm Kimchee Han.

07:39.542 --> 07:40.668
And I'm Jung Kim.

07:40.710 --> 07:43.380
And together we're team Jung...

07:43.422 --> 07:45.340
[both] Jungchee!

07:45.382 --> 07:46.967
And we're gonna run circles

07:47.008 --> 07:49.510
astound the competition.

07:49.552 --> 07:52.513
And Team Jungchee brings fun...

07:52.555 --> 07:54.724
-...positivity.

07:52.555 --> 07:54.724
-And leadership.

07:54.766 --> 07:57.602
And most important, hijinx!

07:57.644 --> 07:58.853
[exhales sharply]

08:01.564 --> 08:05.110
Oh, man! Guy at the garage sale

08:01.564 --> 08:05.110
said these flash pods

08:01.564 --> 08:05.110
were legit.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.321
[remote clicking]

08:07.362 --> 08:10.490
If you wanna just step back.

08:07.362 --> 08:10.490
Or I can get you another doctor

08:07.362 --> 08:10.490
if you feel more comfortable.

08:10.531 --> 08:11.866
I think

08:10.531 --> 08:11.866
we're both professionals.

08:11.908 --> 08:13.827
He's a doctor.

08:11.908 --> 08:13.827
What... What are you?

08:13.868 --> 08:17.038
I have a profession,

08:13.868 --> 08:17.038
and regardless of our history...

08:17.080 --> 08:18.915
-It's rock hard.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.915
-Oh, thank you, I did a video.

08:18.957 --> 08:20.541
-It's peritonitis.

08:18.957 --> 08:20.541
-Oh, my God.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.669
-Ow!

08:20.583 --> 08:22.669
-Your appendix

08:20.583 --> 08:22.669
might be perforated.

08:22.710 --> 08:24.754
-We should get you to surgery.

08:22.710 --> 08:24.754
Now.

08:22.710 --> 08:24.754
-What?

08:24.796 --> 08:26.923
-[stammers] Do you even know

08:24.796 --> 08:26.923
how to do surgery?

08:24.796 --> 08:26.923
-God, no. [laughs]

08:26.965 --> 08:28.549
I mean,

08:26.965 --> 08:28.549
we have surgeons for that.

08:28.591 --> 08:29.884
So, it's on them.

08:29.926 --> 08:32.095
But nothing's going to go wrong.

08:32.137 --> 08:33.930
Page Dr. Mudrick, appendectomy.

08:33.972 --> 08:36.641
-We need an ultrasound,

08:33.972 --> 08:36.641
run an IV. Ancef, one gram.

08:33.972 --> 08:36.641
-Got it.

08:38.393 --> 08:39.560
Put this on.

08:41.355 --> 08:43.106
Is he going to be okay?

08:43.148 --> 08:45.359
He's going to be fine.

08:43.148 --> 08:45.359
Seriously. This is a really

08:43.148 --> 08:45.359
common procedure.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.194
-I should have gotten

08:45.400 --> 08:47.194
him here sooner.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.194
-You did great.

08:47.235 --> 08:49.321
-I'll check in after surgery.

08:47.235 --> 08:49.321
Will you still be here?

08:47.235 --> 08:49.321
-[Gerald] Yes.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.365
Maybe we can talk more then.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.200
Maybe.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.745
Don't let me die

08:56.203 --> 08:57.745
in these underwear.

09:05.462 --> 09:07.297
[Shannon] Head's up.

09:07.339 --> 09:09.590
Hey. Okay.

09:07.339 --> 09:09.590
I'm just headed back to--

09:09.632 --> 09:11.301
-...bring around the Civic?

09:09.632 --> 09:11.301
-On it like a bonnet.

09:11.343 --> 09:12.552
Awesome possum.

09:14.929 --> 09:16.639
What?

09:16.681 --> 09:18.599
I keep thinking we would have

09:16.681 --> 09:18.599
made a great team

09:16.681 --> 09:18.599
on<i> Astounding Trek.</i>

09:18.641 --> 09:21.436
Are you kidding?

09:18.641 --> 09:21.436
The cameras would love us.

09:21.478 --> 09:23.730
-And think of all the fans.

09:21.478 --> 09:23.730
-And we'd have a sweet hashtag.

09:23.771 --> 09:26.733
-Obviously.

09:23.771 --> 09:26.733
-FunJung Shenanigans. [laughs]

09:26.774 --> 09:29.610
-Did you just think of that?

09:26.774 --> 09:29.610
-Yeah.

09:29.652 --> 09:32.406
Anyway, I guess

09:29.652 --> 09:32.406
it's kind of impossible now.

09:32.447 --> 09:35.575
Alejandro? He hates reality TV

09:32.447 --> 09:35.575
and he travels a lot for work.

09:35.616 --> 09:37.618
He doesn't even want children,

09:35.616 --> 09:37.618
not that that's super relevant,

09:37.660 --> 09:39.954
but you never know

09:37.660 --> 09:39.954
with these challenges.

09:39.996 --> 09:43.208
No, I mean, I asked Kimchee.

09:43.833 --> 09:46.253
Oh. Makes sense.

09:46.294 --> 09:48.171
Bros before bosses.

09:49.381 --> 09:51.174
[exhales sharply]

09:51.216 --> 09:53.593
But nothing in the rules

09:51.216 --> 09:53.593
says anything about auditioning

09:51.216 --> 09:53.593
more than once

09:53.634 --> 09:54.886
with different partners.

09:55.845 --> 09:58.056
Well, then

09:58.098 --> 10:00.641
clear my schedule,

09:58.098 --> 10:00.641
I gots me a video to shoot.

10:00.683 --> 10:03.228
-[chuckles]

10:00.683 --> 10:03.228
-[man on phone]<i> Hello?</i>

10:00.683 --> 10:03.228
<i>Who's this?</i>

10:03.270 --> 10:05.813
Oh, sorry, I was...

10:03.270 --> 10:05.813
Goodbye.

10:11.570 --> 10:13.530
I don't know

10:11.570 --> 10:13.530
what's gotten into Sanjeev.

10:13.572 --> 10:17.200
First he rented<i> The Titanic,</i>

10:13.572 --> 10:17.200
then<i> The Aviator,</i>

10:13.572 --> 10:17.200
then the one with the bear.

10:17.242 --> 10:18.868
My God, it's just

10:17.242 --> 10:18.868
too much of him.

10:18.910 --> 10:20.745
-Mr. Mehta or Leonardo DiCaprio?

10:18.910 --> 10:20.745
-Yes.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.289
-Yes.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.289
-Oh.

10:22.330 --> 10:23.873
Oh, Mrs. Mehta. [chuckles]

10:23.915 --> 10:25.666
-How it going?

10:23.915 --> 10:25.666
-Good.

10:25.708 --> 10:28.002
We were just talking about

10:25.708 --> 10:28.002
movies I don't like to watch.

10:28.044 --> 10:30.046
Okay, good to know.

10:28.044 --> 10:30.046
[chuckles]

10:30.088 --> 10:32.673
Umma, how are you doing?

10:32.715 --> 10:34.926
You're looking

10:32.715 --> 10:34.926
very, um, feminine.

10:35.885 --> 10:37.262
I need to get hat.

10:37.304 --> 10:38.638
Oh, okay.

10:38.679 --> 10:41.475
Just climb ladder

10:38.679 --> 10:41.475
and stretch up.

10:41.516 --> 10:42.642
I can't reach. Can you get?

10:43.851 --> 10:44.852
Yeah.

10:46.729 --> 10:48.231
Now?

10:48.273 --> 10:50.108
[Mrs. Mehta]

10:48.273 --> 10:50.108
Or I can get the hats later.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.901
Oh, these are for you.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.901
[chuckles]

10:51.943 --> 10:54.488
They're for my nephews.

10:51.943 --> 10:54.488
They're balding

10:54.529 --> 10:57.073
-[both laugh]

10:54.529 --> 10:57.073
-Yeah. [sighs]

10:57.115 --> 11:00.076
Oh, your calf is naked.

11:00.118 --> 11:02.703
Looks like one is vacation

11:00.118 --> 11:02.703
and other is business.

11:02.745 --> 11:05.039
-[both laughing]

11:02.745 --> 11:05.039
-[Appa] No, I just take off.

11:05.081 --> 11:07.708
One leg is cold,

11:05.081 --> 11:07.708
one leg is hot.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.794
That's a genius of a ports.

11:09.836 --> 11:12.088
I... I'm sorry,

11:09.836 --> 11:12.088
do you name your trousers?

11:12.130 --> 11:13.881
-He called them, "Ports!"

11:12.130 --> 11:13.881
-[both laughing]

11:13.923 --> 11:15.716
Okay, okay,

11:13.923 --> 11:15.716
how many hat do you want?

11:15.758 --> 11:18.677
I'm glad the ladder doesn't have

11:15.758 --> 11:18.677
another step or we'd have

11:15.758 --> 11:18.677
quite the show.

11:18.719 --> 11:20.721
I've seen that show,

11:18.719 --> 11:20.721
and it only so-so.

11:20.763 --> 11:21.931
-[both laughing]

11:20.763 --> 11:21.931
-Just take a hat!

11:21.973 --> 11:23.308
[all gasping]

11:23.350 --> 11:24.559
-[Mrs. Mehta] Oh, dear!

11:23.350 --> 11:24.559
-[Appa] Are you okay?

11:24.601 --> 11:26.353
Ah, yeah!

11:24.601 --> 11:26.353
Don't worry about me,

11:26.394 --> 11:28.938
-just worry about

11:26.394 --> 11:28.938
the missing leg.

11:26.394 --> 11:28.938
-Uh, uh, uh...

11:28.980 --> 11:30.607
I can worry about the both.

11:32.775 --> 11:35.069
[Mrs. Mehta]

11:32.775 --> 11:35.069
If it's all right with you,

11:35.111 --> 11:37.155
I actually want those hats.

11:40.534 --> 11:43.495
-So, here it is.

11:40.534 --> 11:43.495
-Oh, wow!

11:43.537 --> 11:45.872
Could be the best Halloween

11:43.537 --> 11:45.872
costume my mom's ever made.

11:45.913 --> 11:47.207
-You need the teeth?

11:45.913 --> 11:47.207
-Uh, no.

11:47.248 --> 11:49.292
-Widow's peak.

11:47.248 --> 11:49.292
-Just the cape.

11:49.334 --> 11:51.085
Well, the cape's only

11:49.334 --> 11:51.085
a part of it. It's whole look.

11:49.334 --> 11:51.085
No one's going to get it.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.504
This is just to pretend

11:51.127 --> 11:52.504
we're flying.

11:52.546 --> 11:53.754
Oh, this cape is not for flying.

11:53.796 --> 11:56.550
No, no, please, Terence,

11:53.796 --> 11:56.550
it's for my audition tape.

11:56.591 --> 11:58.218
I promise we'll take care of it.

12:00.554 --> 12:03.764
You better. My mom spent

12:00.554 --> 12:03.764
more time on this

12:00.554 --> 12:03.764
than my dinosaur costume.

12:03.806 --> 12:07.143
Oh, and if you could

12:03.806 --> 12:07.143
not tell Kimchee about it,

12:03.806 --> 12:07.143
it's a surprise.

12:07.185 --> 12:10.188
Oh, my God.

12:07.185 --> 12:10.188
I love surprises. I'd kill

12:07.185 --> 12:10.188
to be Kimchee right now.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.731
-Okay, thanks.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.731
-[imitating Dracula]

12:10.230 --> 12:12.731
You're welcome!

12:14.651 --> 12:15.776
It's better with the teeth.

12:19.822 --> 12:22.534
Hey, it's me.

12:19.822 --> 12:22.534
Hope you're doing okay.

12:22.576 --> 12:25.579
If you can hear me in there,

12:22.576 --> 12:25.579
um, I know you're not in a coma.

12:25.620 --> 12:27.539
I hope you're not in a coma.

12:25.620 --> 12:27.539
[laughing]

12:27.581 --> 12:29.332
-You're not, are you?

12:27.581 --> 12:29.332
-[Raj] He's not.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.042
Oh, hey

12:31.418 --> 12:32.793
Hey.

12:32.835 --> 12:34.629
Um, so, uh,

12:32.835 --> 12:34.629
everything went okay?

12:34.671 --> 12:37.090
Yeah, he did great.

12:34.671 --> 12:37.090
Now appendix-free.

12:37.131 --> 12:39.758
Good. I mean,

12:37.131 --> 12:39.758
I think that's good,

12:37.131 --> 12:39.758
I don't know much about them.

12:41.010 --> 12:42.803
You look nice.

12:42.845 --> 12:45.806
Hardly.

12:42.845 --> 12:45.806
It's been such a crazy day.

12:42.845 --> 12:45.806
Scared to look in a mirror.

12:45.848 --> 12:47.808
Well, I'm glad you're here.

12:47.850 --> 12:49.477
I'm glad, too.

12:49.519 --> 12:50.853
Because I need you to sign these

12:49.519 --> 12:50.853
for the medication

12:49.519 --> 12:50.853
and the physio.

12:51.479 --> 12:52.480
Oh, right.

12:56.859 --> 12:58.069
I've been thinking a lot

12:56.859 --> 12:58.069
about you.

13:00.196 --> 13:01.948
Okay.

13:01.989 --> 13:04.367
I was serious about

13:01.989 --> 13:04.367
what I said before,

13:01.989 --> 13:04.367
that I want to be together.

13:04.409 --> 13:05.410
-I--

13:04.409 --> 13:05.410
-[Umma] Hi, Janet!

13:06.453 --> 13:08.079
Raj? What's he doing here?

13:08.121 --> 13:10.206
Um, he's Gerald's doctor.

13:10.248 --> 13:12.250
You're wearing lots

13:10.248 --> 13:12.250
of eyeshadow today.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.834
You're blinking a lot today.

13:13.876 --> 13:15.044
And your skirt is too tight.

13:15.086 --> 13:17.380
Well, your haircut is...

13:15.086 --> 13:17.380
What is your haircut?

13:17.422 --> 13:18.839
It's new.

13:18.881 --> 13:20.675
I just came to check on Gerald.

13:18.881 --> 13:20.675
I should go.

13:20.717 --> 13:24.011
Oh, so now you're leaving Gerald

13:20.717 --> 13:24.011
so you can go see other patient?

13:24.053 --> 13:25.472
Well, yeah.

13:25.513 --> 13:27.348
And I have bet other patient

13:25.513 --> 13:27.348
is much more serious.

13:27.390 --> 13:29.850
than casual, no-string-attached

13:27.390 --> 13:29.850
patient Janet.

13:29.892 --> 13:32.061
-[gasps] I mean Gerald.

13:29.892 --> 13:32.061
-Umma, now is not the time.

13:32.103 --> 13:33.647
It's okay. I deserve that.

13:33.688 --> 13:35.398
Yeah, you deserve much more.

13:35.440 --> 13:37.816
You should lose the licence

13:35.440 --> 13:37.816
and the job

13:35.440 --> 13:37.816
and the full head of hair.

13:39.110 --> 13:40.236
Is your eye okay?

13:40.278 --> 13:41.571
None of your business.

13:41.613 --> 13:43.822
Actually, it is. He's a doctor.

13:43.864 --> 13:45.866
And a really good one.

13:45.908 --> 13:48.745
Okay, but only because

13:45.908 --> 13:48.745
I can't see anything.

13:50.079 --> 13:51.539
Look at me.

13:52.749 --> 13:53.916
Hey,

13:53.958 --> 13:56.336
what's wrong with that

13:53.958 --> 13:56.336
little boy's eye?

13:59.046 --> 14:00.881
Hey, Terence.

14:00.923 --> 14:04.177
Kimchee, hi, you look great.

14:00.923 --> 14:04.177
Thanks for passing through.

14:04.218 --> 14:06.012
-You okay?

14:04.218 --> 14:06.012
-[Terence]

14:04.218 --> 14:06.012
Just don't step on it.

14:06.053 --> 14:08.847
-[Kimchee] On what?

14:06.053 --> 14:08.847
-I've said too much, but

14:06.053 --> 14:08.847
I didn't say audition. Damn it.

14:12.893 --> 14:14.895
Hey, have you see Jung?

14:14.937 --> 14:16.939
Every day,

14:14.937 --> 14:16.939
whether I want to or not.

14:16.981 --> 14:18.692
But, no, not lately.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.653
Well, I'm going

14:19.859 --> 14:21.653
to head out.

14:21.695 --> 14:22.987
-Okay, see you.

14:21.695 --> 14:22.987
-Bye!

14:30.495 --> 14:32.038
[Umma] I know, I know.

14:32.079 --> 14:34.915
I look like a Captain Hook

14:32.079 --> 14:34.915
or a Peter Pan

14:34.957 --> 14:36.250
or both. Say it.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.086
Yeah?

14:40.630 --> 14:42.549
This one is hot Italian,

14:42.590 --> 14:44.925
and this one

14:42.590 --> 14:44.925
is a German bratwurst, huh?

14:45.760 --> 14:47.387
Go ahead. Say it.

14:49.930 --> 14:51.725
-[chuckles]

14:49.930 --> 14:51.725
-Yeah.

14:51.766 --> 14:55.854
Maybe it's not, uh, best idea

14:51.766 --> 14:55.854
to always say something.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.272
Yeah, talking is over-rate.

14:58.314 --> 14:59.524
How do your eye?

14:59.566 --> 15:01.942
It's okay.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.942
Cornea's a little scratched.

15:01.984 --> 15:04.529
-How is your leg?

15:01.984 --> 15:04.529
-Like a volcano.

15:04.571 --> 15:07.114
-Maybe you can use some cream.

15:04.571 --> 15:07.114
-Yeah, that sounds good.

15:07.156 --> 15:09.283
Mm-hmm. I can do for you.

15:07.156 --> 15:09.283
Put up.

15:09.325 --> 15:11.494
Oh, thank you, Umma.

15:11.536 --> 15:12.829
So sore.

15:13.830 --> 15:15.331
[sighs] Ahh!

15:17.208 --> 15:18.959
[gasps]

15:19.001 --> 15:22.296
-Yeah, uh,

15:19.001 --> 15:22.296
just a little bit more.

15:19.001 --> 15:22.296
-[Appa coughing]

15:22.338 --> 15:24.965
Yeah. [squirming]

15:25.007 --> 15:26.008
[winces]

15:33.767 --> 15:35.727
[exhales sharply]

15:40.022 --> 15:43.025
-Hey.

15:40.022 --> 15:43.025
-You look surprised to see me.

15:43.067 --> 15:45.737
Well, you're on my bed

15:43.067 --> 15:45.737
in the dark.

15:45.779 --> 15:48.865
How astounding.

15:45.779 --> 15:48.865
Did you have a safe trek home?

15:48.907 --> 15:50.241
Okay, what's going on?

15:51.992 --> 15:54.662
<i>Hi, I'm Jung,</i>

15:51.992 --> 15:54.662
<i>and this is my boss Shannon.</i>

15:54.704 --> 15:57.206
[Shannon on laptop]

15:54.704 --> 15:57.206
<i>We're friends too,</i>

15:54.704 --> 15:57.206
<i>but I'm definitely in charge.</i>

15:57.248 --> 16:00.668
<i>Here at Handy Car Rental,</i>

15:57.248 --> 16:00.668
<i>we see a lot of people</i>

15:57.248 --> 16:00.668
<i>embarking on...</i>

16:01.836 --> 16:03.379
-[both]<i> ...adventures!</i>

16:01.836 --> 16:03.379
-Adventures.

16:03.421 --> 16:05.005
-[Shannon]<i> Now it's our turn</i>

16:03.421 --> 16:05.005
<i>to embark--</i>

16:03.421 --> 16:05.005
-[clears throat]

16:05.047 --> 16:07.341
<i>...on one of our own.</i>

16:07.383 --> 16:10.720
-[triumphant music playing

16:07.383 --> 16:10.720
on laptop]

16:07.383 --> 16:10.720
-[wind blowing]

16:10.762 --> 16:12.555
-I don't get it.

16:10.762 --> 16:12.555
-She's supposed to be flying.

16:12.597 --> 16:14.641
No. After everything

16:12.597 --> 16:14.641
we've been through?

16:14.682 --> 16:16.016
Kimchee, I'm sorry.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.769
Come on, what does she have

16:16.058 --> 16:17.769
that I don't?

16:17.811 --> 16:19.979
Nothing! It just happened.

16:20.020 --> 16:23.065
We were talking about the show

16:20.020 --> 16:23.065
and then one thing led

16:20.020 --> 16:23.065
to another and then,

16:23.107 --> 16:25.652
suddenly we were

16:23.107 --> 16:25.652
hashtag FunJung Shenanigans.

16:25.693 --> 16:27.236
That's even a good hashtag.

16:27.278 --> 16:29.739
-I'm sorry you had

16:27.278 --> 16:29.739
to find out this way.

16:27.278 --> 16:29.739
-[Kimchee] Me too.

16:29.781 --> 16:31.950
But now you've got to choose.

16:29.781 --> 16:31.950
Me or her?

16:31.991 --> 16:35.620
Hashtag Fun Chung Shenanigans

16:31.991 --> 16:35.620
or our hashtag?

16:35.662 --> 16:37.997
-And what was that again?

16:35.662 --> 16:37.997
-You disgust me.

16:39.624 --> 16:41.668
[sighs]

16:41.709 --> 16:42.794
You don't even remember, do you?

16:42.836 --> 16:44.420
I'm under a lot of stress

16:42.836 --> 16:44.420
right now.

16:54.221 --> 16:55.890
Oh, hey, what's going on?

16:55.932 --> 16:58.392
The big DC. Discharged.

16:58.434 --> 17:00.645
Oh. So you're out of here.

17:00.687 --> 17:03.898
That's good news for us both.

17:03.940 --> 17:07.610
But I guess we need

17:03.940 --> 17:07.610
to stick around to get

17:03.940 --> 17:07.610
the A-okay from the doctors.

17:07.652 --> 17:10.738
No, surgeon said

17:07.652 --> 17:10.738
I was good to go.

17:10.780 --> 17:12.657
Still, we should probably

17:10.780 --> 17:12.657
clear it with Raj.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.284
Or whoever admitted you,

17:12.699 --> 17:15.284
but I guess that was Raj.

17:15.326 --> 17:19.622
Yeah, I wanted to thank him

17:15.326 --> 17:19.622
but the nurse said

17:15.326 --> 17:19.622
he wasn't on shift.

17:19.664 --> 17:22.876
Well, if the surgeon says

17:19.664 --> 17:22.876
you're good to go,

17:19.664 --> 17:22.876
I guess you're good to go.

17:22.917 --> 17:24.627
-Yeah, so let's go.

17:22.917 --> 17:24.627
-Yeah.

17:30.466 --> 17:34.888
So, it seems that team

17:30.466 --> 17:34.888
FunJung Shenanigans

17:30.466 --> 17:34.888
has met its first challenge.

17:34.929 --> 17:37.097
-Kimchee knows.

17:34.929 --> 17:37.097
-About Project Blast Off?

17:37.139 --> 17:38.098
He saw it all.

17:38.140 --> 17:39.684
This really stinks.

17:39.726 --> 17:43.646
-Now he wants me to choose.

17:39.726 --> 17:43.646
-Oh.

17:43.688 --> 17:48.067
Well, I guess you have no choice

17:43.688 --> 17:48.067
but to choose your best friend.

17:48.108 --> 17:50.028
[imitates buzzer sounding]

17:48.108 --> 17:50.028
You choose

17:50.069 --> 17:52.071
the astounding teammates

17:50.069 --> 17:52.071
who's going to help you win.

17:53.113 --> 17:54.949
Uh, that's you.

17:54.991 --> 17:57.577
I choose you.

17:54.991 --> 17:57.577
That's what this is about.

17:57.618 --> 17:59.286
I know, but, uh...

17:59.328 --> 18:02.373
-I was just thinking, I should

17:59.328 --> 18:02.373
probably run it by Alejandro.

17:59.328 --> 18:02.373
-Oh.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.418
Okay.

18:05.459 --> 18:08.713
But if I do run it by Alejandro

18:05.459 --> 18:08.713
it will start

18:05.459 --> 18:08.713
a whole other thing.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.966
-And who wants that?

18:08.755 --> 18:11.966
-Not me, so...

18:12.008 --> 18:14.635
Maybe the best thing is

18:12.008 --> 18:14.635
not to submit our audition tapes

18:14.677 --> 18:17.346
so I won't have

18:14.677 --> 18:17.346
to run it by Alejandro.

18:14.677 --> 18:17.346
[exhales sharply]

18:17.388 --> 18:18.389
[sighs]

18:18.973 --> 18:19.974
Sorry.

18:20.349 --> 18:21.976
I get it.

18:22.018 --> 18:23.102
Alejandros before bros.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.564
I talked to Chelsea.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.564
She says,

18:26.606 --> 18:28.942
"Thinking of you," and sent,

18:26.606 --> 18:28.942
uh, a heart eyes smiley face.

18:28.983 --> 18:30.150
-That's sweet.

18:28.983 --> 18:30.150
-Yeah.

18:30.192 --> 18:31.819
She didn't respond to my text.

18:32.361 --> 18:33.362
Janet.

18:34.196 --> 18:36.156
Hey.

18:36.198 --> 18:38.451
-So you guys are heading out?

18:36.198 --> 18:38.451
-[Gerald] Yeah.

18:38.492 --> 18:40.160
But, um,

18:38.492 --> 18:40.160
leaving a part of me here.

18:40.202 --> 18:41.662
-Mmm?

18:40.202 --> 18:41.662
-My appendix.

18:41.704 --> 18:43.330
-Yeah, they don't keep it.

18:41.704 --> 18:43.330
-Oh.

18:47.209 --> 18:49.169
You mind giving us a second?

18:49.211 --> 18:52.172
-Janet, do you want to grab

18:49.211 --> 18:52.172
a snack or something?

18:49.211 --> 18:52.172
-I think he meant me.

18:53.424 --> 18:55.718
[stammers] Oh, sure.

18:53.424 --> 18:55.718
I'll just walk

18:55.760 --> 18:58.096
gingerly over this way.

19:00.389 --> 19:02.892
[sighs] I remember that dress.

19:02.934 --> 19:05.185
-From when?

19:02.934 --> 19:05.185
-Pinkerton's.

19:05.227 --> 19:08.230
I knocked the creme brulee

19:05.227 --> 19:08.230
onto it when I tried

19:05.227 --> 19:08.230
kissing you.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.691
Guess you were nervous

19:08.272 --> 19:10.691
thinking your fiancee

19:08.272 --> 19:10.691
would catch you.

19:10.733 --> 19:12.944
That's not why I was nervous.

19:12.986 --> 19:14.194
[elevator bell dings]

19:14.236 --> 19:15.529
I should go.

19:15.571 --> 19:17.156
It's over between me and Divya.

19:17.949 --> 19:19.199
What?

19:19.241 --> 19:21.869
I mean, I haven't actually

19:19.241 --> 19:21.869
ended it yet, but...

19:21.911 --> 19:24.747
-Of course not.

19:21.911 --> 19:24.747
-Look, I know

19:21.911 --> 19:24.747
I screwed up a lot,

19:24.789 --> 19:26.457
but I'm going

19:24.789 --> 19:26.457
to make this right.

19:32.254 --> 19:33.673
Well, good luck with that.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.598
Did Janet leave?

19:42.640 --> 19:44.183
She has my house keys.

19:50.314 --> 19:51.774
What's this?

19:51.816 --> 19:54.234
Gift. Spanish travel dictionary.

19:54.276 --> 19:57.363
Look, even if I won

19:54.276 --> 19:57.363
the<i> Astounding Trek,</i>

19:57.404 --> 19:59.448
it wouldn't be a win

19:57.404 --> 19:59.448
unless it was with you.

19:59.490 --> 20:01.241
We travel together every day.

20:01.283 --> 20:04.954
Our apartment is like,

20:01.283 --> 20:04.954
the waiting room

20:01.283 --> 20:04.954
in the airport of life,

20:04.996 --> 20:07.414
-and the only destination...

20:04.996 --> 20:07.414
-Shannon turned you down,

20:04.996 --> 20:07.414
didn't she?

20:07.456 --> 20:11.251
-[sighs] I think you're missing

20:07.456 --> 20:11.251
the point.

20:07.456 --> 20:11.251
-Thanks, man.

20:11.293 --> 20:13.963
Hey, you want to trek over

20:11.293 --> 20:13.963
to that Tibetan place

20:11.293 --> 20:13.963
after work?

20:14.005 --> 20:15.840
-Yeah, man, your treat.

20:14.005 --> 20:15.840
-[chuckles]

20:15.882 --> 20:18.217
-See, we totally are those guys.

20:15.882 --> 20:18.217

Oh, hi, Frank.

20:33.649 --> 20:35.275
Mrs. Kim.

20:35.317 --> 20:36.485
Uh, where's the worst half?

20:36.527 --> 20:38.278
Oh, post office. Oh.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.572
New pants?

20:39.613 --> 20:42.282
Oh, yeah. They're amazing.

20:39.613 --> 20:42.282
Let me show you.

20:42.324 --> 20:44.284
-I know already.

20:42.324 --> 20:44.284
-[Frank] All I have to do

20:44.326 --> 20:45.578
is zip,

20:46.328 --> 20:47.329
zip...

20:48.748 --> 20:51.125
<i>Voila!</i> Slacks to shorts.

20:51.167 --> 20:53.293
Or some people call them slorts.

21:00.009 --> 21:03.303
-we're twins!

21:00.009 --> 21:03.303
-Uh-huh.

21:03.345 --> 21:06.891
Not only do we share

21:03.345 --> 21:06.891
a love of brevity,

21:03.345 --> 21:06.891
but also a flair for fashion.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.101
Race you to shorts.

21:09.685 --> 21:10.770
[unzipping]

21:14.523 --> 21:16.275
Wow, you're quick.

21:19.195 --> 21:21.321
-I never want

21:19.195 --> 21:21.321
to see these again.

21:19.195 --> 21:21.321
-Mmm.
