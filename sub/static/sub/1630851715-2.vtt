WEBVTT

00:01.392 --> 00:03.351
PREVIOUSLY ON "BATWOMAN"...

00:03.394 --> 00:04.526
ALICE WAS RIGHT.

00:04.569 --> 00:06.267
YOUR MOM'S STILL
ALIVE, RYAN.

00:06.310 --> 00:08.051
IF YOU WANT
TO KNOW HER NAME.

00:08.095 --> 00:09.139
IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

00:10.880 --> 00:12.447
SO, WHAT'S NEXT, BATWOMAN?

00:12.490 --> 00:14.405
WE FIND
THAT CASE OF BATMAN TROPHIES

00:14.449 --> 00:16.973
BEFORE ANYONE ELSE DOES.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.366
WHY DID YOU CALL ME HERE?

00:18.409 --> 00:20.063
OVER A DOZEN WEAPONS
OF MASS DESTRUCTION

00:20.107 --> 00:21.586
ARE BELLY-UP IN THE
GOTHAM RIVER SOMEWHERE.

00:21.630 --> 00:22.892
SO, TOGETHER, YOU TWO

00:22.935 --> 00:24.502
ARE GONNA FIND
AND STOP EVERY FREAK

00:24.546 --> 00:26.026
WHO GETS HIS HANDS ON
ONE OF THESE WEAPONS

00:26.069 --> 00:27.505
UNTIL EACH OF
THE ITEMS ON THAT LIST

00:27.549 --> 00:28.985
ARE FOUND
AND ACCOUNTED FOR.

00:41.128 --> 00:42.477
- - SHH, SHH, SHH.

00:47.525 --> 00:49.614
NICE.

00:49.658 --> 00:51.268
COULD YOU BE
A LITTLE LOUDER?

00:51.312 --> 00:52.922
I DON'T THINK THEY
HEARD YOU IN STAR CITY.

00:58.884 --> 01:00.930
HEH.

01:03.976 --> 01:06.283
HOW COLD DO YOU THINK
THE POOL WATER IS?

01:13.247 --> 01:14.509
IT'S ACTUALLY
REALLY WARM.

01:31.308 --> 01:32.614
SERIOUSLY?

01:34.616 --> 01:36.966
OK. I GET IT.

01:37.009 --> 01:39.925
YOU CAN HOLD YOUR BREATH
FOR A REALLY LONG TIME.

01:39.969 --> 01:42.102
BUT I GOT NEWS FOR YOU.

01:42.145 --> 01:45.105
THE WORLD ALREADY HAS
AN AQUAMAN.

01:45.148 --> 01:46.497
HE'S A LOT MORE RIPPED.

01:53.417 --> 01:54.462
DEREK?

01:56.464 --> 01:59.989
IF YOU'RE WAITING FOR ME TO SAY
THIS ISN'T FUNNY, THEN FINE.

02:00.032 --> 02:02.122
THIS ISN'T FUNNY.
YOU CAN COME UP NOW.

02:05.603 --> 02:08.389
OHH! AAH! AAH!

02:08.432 --> 02:09.738
AAH!

02:09.781 --> 02:11.696
AAH!

02:32.021 --> 02:33.414
AAH!

02:49.081 --> 02:50.692
BY THE ORDER OF
THE MAYOR'S OFFICE,

02:50.735 --> 02:53.521
IN EXCHANGE FOR YOUR COOPERATION
IN THESE CASES,

02:53.564 --> 02:55.784
YOU WILL BE REMANDED
INTO SUPERVISED CUSTODY.

03:05.620 --> 03:08.405
IF YOU HARM
OR ATTEMPT TO HARM ANY PERSON,

03:08.449 --> 03:11.278
THIS RELEASE WILL BE RESCINDED.

03:11.321 --> 03:14.585
IF YOU VIOLATE ANY OF THE LAWS
OF GOTHAM CITY,

03:14.629 --> 03:16.370
THIS RELEASE WILL BE RESCINDED.

03:20.069 --> 03:21.288
IF YOU ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE,

03:21.331 --> 03:22.985
THIS RELEASE WILL BE RESCINDED

03:23.028 --> 03:24.247
AND YOU WILL SPEND
THE REMAINDER OF YOUR LIFE

03:24.291 --> 03:27.076
AT ARKHAM IN
SOLITARY CONFINEMENT.

03:27.119 --> 03:28.730
ANY QUESTIONS?

03:28.773 --> 03:30.645
YES.

03:30.688 --> 03:32.908
DOES THIS KIND OF WRECK
MY ENSEMBLE?

03:34.779 --> 03:36.912
ANY QUESTIONS I'M
LIKELY TO ANSWER?

03:36.955 --> 03:38.000
I GOT ONE.

03:40.263 --> 03:42.352
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
ANY OF THIS IS GONNA STICK?

03:44.311 --> 03:46.138
YOU.

03:46.182 --> 03:47.531
BECAUSE YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE

03:47.575 --> 03:48.924
FOR EVERYTHING
SHE DOES.

03:48.967 --> 03:50.360
SHE CROSSES THE LINE,
YOUR DAYS

03:50.404 --> 03:52.188
AS A CAPED VIGILANTE
ARE OVER.

03:54.321 --> 03:55.452
I MIGHT EVEN ARRANGE
FOR YOU TWO

03:55.496 --> 03:56.975
TO HAVE ADJOINING CELLS.

03:57.019 --> 03:59.761
YOU'RE TYING MY FATE
TO A PSYCHOPATH?

03:59.804 --> 04:02.807
WELL, MORE LIKE
HANDCUFFING IT, BUT YES.

04:02.851 --> 04:04.113
UNTIL YOU TWO HAVE
TRACKED DOWN

04:04.156 --> 04:05.680
EVERY LAST ONE
OF THOSE TOXIC TOYS

04:05.723 --> 04:07.247
FROM BATMAN'S
TROPHY CASE.

04:08.596 --> 04:09.771
'CAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE
ANOTHER ONE'S ALREADY

04:09.814 --> 04:11.338
RACKING UP
A BODY COUNT.

04:15.385 --> 04:16.995
IN A CRIME
AS COLD-BLOODED

04:17.039 --> 04:19.346
AS THE CREATURE SOME SAY
IS RESPONSIBLE,

04:19.389 --> 04:21.783
TWO GOTHAM UNIVERSITY STUDENTS
ARE MISSING

04:21.826 --> 04:24.786
AND PRESUMED DEAD
AFTER BLOOD AND NOT MUCH ELSE

04:24.829 --> 04:26.004
WAS FOUND AT THE SCENE,

04:26.048 --> 04:28.224
SAVE FOR A GRISLY CALLING CARD

04:28.268 --> 04:29.878
WHICH EERILY RESEMBLES THAT

04:29.921 --> 04:32.097
OF BATMAN FOE KILLER CROC,

04:32.141 --> 04:34.970
WHO TERRORIZED GOTHAM
NEARLY TWO DECADES AGO

04:35.013 --> 04:38.060
IN A VIOLENT REIGN
OF REPTILIAN TERROR.

04:38.103 --> 04:40.802
AND WHILE SOME INSIST
THIS MAY JUST BE THE WORK

04:40.845 --> 04:42.934
OF AN ATTENTION-SEEKING COPYCAT,

04:42.978 --> 04:44.762
AUTHORITIES CAN'T SAY FOR SURE

04:44.806 --> 04:47.112
WHETHER GOTHAM HAS
A NEW LIZARD PROBLEM

04:47.156 --> 04:50.333
OR IF THIS KILLER
IS JUST A CROCK.

04:50.377 --> 04:53.031
AND WHILE INITIAL SEARCHES FOR--

04:53.075 --> 04:56.208
KILLER CROC,
A.K.A. WAYLON JONES.

04:56.252 --> 04:57.427
FORMER PROFESSIONAL WRESTLER
WHO SUFFERED FROM

04:57.471 --> 04:59.603
AN UNIDENTIFIED
INFECTION

04:59.647 --> 05:01.301
THAT CAUSED HIS SKIN
TO GROW SCALES,

05:01.344 --> 05:03.694
HENCE THE APPEARANCE
OF A CROCODILE.

05:03.738 --> 05:05.435
NOW, AS
THE INFECTION PROGRESSED,

05:05.479 --> 05:08.525
OTHER PHYSICAL
ABNORMALITIES FOLLOWED--

05:08.569 --> 05:11.354
ELONGATED JAW, CLAWS, TAIL.

05:11.398 --> 05:12.486
I REMEMBER HIM.

05:12.529 --> 05:13.965
BATMAN KILLED HIM, RIGHT?

05:14.009 --> 05:15.358
OH, NO.

05:15.402 --> 05:17.229
NO. NO, BRUCE
TRIED TO SAVE HIM.

05:17.273 --> 05:18.579
HE TOOK PITY ON HIM.
HE ALWAYS THOUGHT

05:18.622 --> 05:20.581
THAT HIS VIOLENT TENDENCIES

05:20.624 --> 05:22.191
WERE A RESULT OF
THE INFECTION.

05:22.234 --> 05:23.671
HE ACTUALLY HAD
WAYNETECH LABS

05:23.714 --> 05:25.063
WORKING ON A CURE
FOR HIS CONDITION.

05:25.107 --> 05:26.891
A WAY TO REVERSE IT. BUT...

05:26.935 --> 05:28.240
THEY NEVER FOUND IT, THOUGH.

05:28.284 --> 05:29.677
SO, WHAT HAPPENED?

05:29.720 --> 05:31.505
THE GCPD HAPPENED.

05:31.548 --> 05:33.681
THEY HAD THEIR OWN IDEAS
OF HOW TO DEAL WITH K.C.,

05:33.724 --> 05:35.770
SO, THEY DROPPED
A TRUCKLOAD OF THERMITE

05:35.813 --> 05:37.075
INTO THE SEWER JUNCTION.

05:37.119 --> 05:38.250
RIGHT ON TOP OF HIM.

05:38.294 --> 05:39.904
LIT THE PRIMER CORD
AND RAN.

05:39.948 --> 05:41.253
SO, THAT TOOTH?

05:41.297 --> 05:42.690
PRETTY MUCH ALL THAT
WAS LEFT OF HIM.

05:42.733 --> 05:43.995
AND NOW IT'S LOOSE.

05:44.039 --> 05:46.346
OK, BUT HOW
COULD A TOOTH

05:46.389 --> 05:48.304
HAVE CREATED A WHOLE
'NOTHER CROC?

05:48.348 --> 05:49.697
I MEAN, I GET A LIZARD

05:49.740 --> 05:51.046
CAN GROW BACK
A WHOLE NEW TAIL,

05:51.089 --> 05:52.439
BUT PLEASE
TELL ME THAT TOOTH

05:52.482 --> 05:54.397
DIDN'T GROW BACK
A WHOLE NEW KILLER CROC.

05:54.441 --> 05:56.094
IF THE ORIGINAL
KILLER CROC

05:56.138 --> 05:57.618
SUFFERED FROM
AN INFECTION,

05:57.661 --> 05:59.794
THEN IT WOULD'VE GOTTEN
INTO HIS BLOODSTREAM.

05:59.837 --> 06:02.666
SO, MAYBE THE TOOTH
CARRIED THE INFECTION.

06:02.710 --> 06:03.972
AND WHOEVER FOUND IT...

06:04.015 --> 06:05.408
WE NEED TO FIND THEM.

06:05.452 --> 06:07.192
BUT THE QUESTION IS, HOW?

06:07.236 --> 06:08.498
I HAVE A QUESTION.

06:13.242 --> 06:15.679
WHY IS THERE A TREE IN HERE?

06:17.594 --> 06:19.944
I MEAN, I GET
THE WHOLE BAT MOTIF,

06:19.988 --> 06:23.339
BUT THIS IS A, UM,
44-STORY BUILDING.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.776
SURELY THERE'S A MORE
COMFORTABLE WORKSPACE AVAILABLE.

06:28.300 --> 06:30.694
I NEED TO TALK
TO YOU BOTH.

06:30.738 --> 06:31.913
IN PRIVATE.

06:38.006 --> 06:40.095
I'M JUST GONNA HANG OUT HERE.

06:45.535 --> 06:47.972
OK. IF NEW CROC'S ANYTHING
LIKE THE OLD ONE,

06:48.016 --> 06:49.409
I'M GONNA NEED
BATWING ON MY 6.

06:49.452 --> 06:50.671
WHERE ARE YOU
WITH FIGURING OUT

06:50.714 --> 06:52.194
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THE SUIT?

06:52.237 --> 06:53.543
UH, STILL WORKING ON IT
BUT MAKING PROGRESS.

06:53.587 --> 06:54.718
OK, WELL,
WHY DON'T YOU TWO

06:54.762 --> 06:56.067
PUT YOUR
NERD BRAINS TOGETHER

06:56.111 --> 06:58.200
AND TRY TO
FAST-TRACK A FIX.

06:58.243 --> 07:00.681
YEAH. YEAH,
WE'LL GET ON IT.

07:00.724 --> 07:02.509
KNOCK-KNOCK.

07:02.552 --> 07:03.988
GOT MY HANDS
ON A COPY OF

07:04.032 --> 07:06.208
THE FORENSICS REPORT
FROM THE POOL ATTACK.

07:06.251 --> 07:08.645
FAIR WARNING--
THE WORD "SECRETION"

07:08.689 --> 07:10.473
COMES UP IN
SEVERAL PLACES,

07:10.517 --> 07:11.953
BECAUSE APPARENTLY,
HIS DROOL

07:11.996 --> 07:13.520
CONTAINS A PARALYTIC AGENT

07:13.563 --> 07:15.739
WHICH RENDERS HIS
VICTIMS UNCONSCIOUS,

07:15.783 --> 07:16.914
ALLOWING HIM TO

07:16.958 --> 07:18.960
FEED ON THEM
AT HIS LEISURE.

07:19.003 --> 07:20.875
I SHOULD PROBABLY
PUT IT OUT THERE RIGHT NOW

07:20.918 --> 07:23.965
THAT I REALLY DO NOT
DO REPTILES.

07:24.008 --> 07:26.097
OK. LET'S GET ALICE ON THIS.

07:26.141 --> 07:27.664
IF CRAZY STUFF'S
GOING DOWN,

07:27.708 --> 07:29.666
MAY AS WELL GET THE CRAZY
LADY'S TAKE ON IT.

07:29.710 --> 07:32.539
UM, WE DON'T REALLY USE

07:32.582 --> 07:34.671
THE "C" WORD ANYMORE.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.067
"CRAZY"?

07:42.462 --> 07:43.637
WHAT THE HELL?

07:51.993 --> 07:53.560
SEEMS WE HAVE A GUEST.

07:53.603 --> 07:54.952
SECURITY CLEARED
A LANDING REQUEST

07:54.996 --> 07:57.912
FOR THE CEO OF
JETURIAN INDUSTRIES.

07:59.957 --> 08:01.350
JADA JET.

08:01.393 --> 08:03.308
SHE'S APPARENTLY
INSISTING ON A MEETING

08:03.352 --> 08:04.571
WITH THE WAYNE CEO
AND WILL NOT LEAVE

08:04.614 --> 08:05.833
UNTIL SHE HAS ONE.

08:05.876 --> 08:07.008
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

08:07.051 --> 08:08.096
WELL, WE CAN'T EXACTLY

08:08.139 --> 08:10.054
TELL HER, "WE DON'T KNOW

08:10.098 --> 08:11.882
WHERE OUR BILLIONAIRE
CEO IS."

08:11.926 --> 08:13.057
I HAVE A FEELING
SHE'LL SETTLE

08:13.101 --> 08:15.016
FOR THE ACTING CEO.

08:15.059 --> 08:18.236
- GREAT.
- WHO'S THE ACTING CEO?

08:18.280 --> 08:19.629
ME.

08:19.673 --> 08:21.239
KATE WANTED TO MAKE SURE
WE COULD HANDLE

08:21.283 --> 08:22.980
ANY PROBLEMS THAT
AROSE IN HER ABSENCE.

08:23.024 --> 08:25.026
THOUGHT I'D JUST BE
THE NAME ON THE LETTERHEAD.

08:25.069 --> 08:26.810
OK. WELL,
IF JADA JET

08:26.854 --> 08:28.638
WANTS TO MEET
WAYNE'S TOP-OP,

08:28.682 --> 08:29.857
I'M GONNA NEED TO LOOK THE PART.

08:29.900 --> 08:32.163
OH! ACTUALLY,
YOU ARE IN LUCK,

08:32.207 --> 08:33.600
BECAUSE I JUST PICKED UP

08:33.643 --> 08:35.384
A TON OF DRY CLEANING.

08:36.994 --> 08:39.127
AND WHY DON'T YOU
TRY TO FIND OUT

08:39.170 --> 08:40.128
WHAT OUR UNINVITED
GUEST WANTS.

08:40.171 --> 08:41.390
OK.

08:43.871 --> 08:47.309
HEY. I KNOW YOU SAID

08:47.352 --> 08:48.963
YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO KNOW THIS,

08:49.006 --> 08:50.573
BUT BEFORE YOU
SIT DOWN WITH HER,

08:50.617 --> 08:52.357
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
KNOW THAT...

08:54.838 --> 08:57.580
THAT UNINVITED GUEST
IS YOUR BIRTH MOTHER.

09:04.195 --> 09:06.371
OK. TELL THE TRUTH.

09:07.721 --> 09:09.157
DOES THIS SAY, "NO,

09:09.200 --> 09:12.160
I HAVEN'T BEEN CEO
FOR JUST 5 MINUTES"?

09:12.203 --> 09:14.336
NO. IT SAYS,
"I'M A CONFIDENT,

09:14.379 --> 09:15.903
"PUT-TOGETHER,
YOUNG BLACK WOMAN

09:15.946 --> 09:17.687
WHO YOU WERE AN IDIOT
TO EVER GIVE UP."

09:19.167 --> 09:21.038
YOU THINK SHE KNOWS?

09:21.082 --> 09:23.606
PRETTY BIG COINCIDENCE
IF SHE DOESN'T.

09:25.129 --> 09:26.478
WHAT DOES SHE WANT?

09:27.654 --> 09:29.177
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

09:34.443 --> 09:36.097
I JUST WANT TO GET
THROUGH THIS MEETING

09:36.140 --> 09:37.402
AND NEVER SEE HER AGAIN.

09:38.839 --> 09:40.275
AND I WANT TO GET
HER DAMN HELICOPTER

09:40.318 --> 09:42.016
OFF OF MY ROOF.

09:42.059 --> 09:43.757
OK. UM, AHEM,

09:43.800 --> 09:45.628
WHAT IS THE ABSOLUTE MINIMUM
I NEED TO KNOW

09:45.672 --> 09:47.935
TO GET THROUGH THIS
UNSCATHED?

09:47.978 --> 09:50.981
WHAT WOULD BRUCE WAYNE
INSIST ON KNOWING ABOUT HER?

09:51.025 --> 09:52.374
PROBABLY HER BRA SIZE.

09:54.985 --> 09:58.423
JETURIAN INDUSTRIES

09:58.467 --> 10:00.817
SPECIALIZES IN
MICROTECHNOLOGY.

10:00.861 --> 10:02.210
JADA JET TOOK CONTROL

10:02.253 --> 10:03.254
AFTER THE DEATH
OF HER HUSBAND

10:03.298 --> 10:04.473
A DECADE AGO.

10:04.516 --> 10:05.474
DOUBLED THE COMPANY'S WEALTH

10:05.517 --> 10:07.041
IN HALF THAT TIME.

10:07.084 --> 10:08.216
SHE'S A FIGHTER.

10:10.435 --> 10:11.567
BUT SO ARE YOU.

10:19.836 --> 10:20.881
SEND HER IN.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.667
HEY. JUST REMEMBER,

10:24.711 --> 10:26.495
SHE NEVER
GAVE YOU ANYTHING,

10:26.538 --> 10:28.366
SO, SHE CAN'T TAKE
ANYTHING AWAY.

10:33.502 --> 10:34.634
YOU GOT THIS.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.565
IF I HAD KNOWN
WAYNE HAD A NEW CEO,

10:53.609 --> 10:55.480
I WOULD HAVE SENT A GIFT BASKET.

10:58.875 --> 11:02.313
RYAN. AND IT'S ACTING CEO.

11:03.793 --> 11:05.708
SO, BRUCE WAYNE
CHECKS HIS STOCK PRICE

11:05.752 --> 11:06.883
FROM A SUPERYACHT
IN BELIZE

11:06.927 --> 11:08.276
WHILE YOU DO
ALL THE REAL WORK?

11:10.104 --> 11:11.235
JADA JET.

11:12.541 --> 11:14.674
NICE TO MEET YOU.

11:14.717 --> 11:16.110
WERE YOU AND BRUCE
ACQUAINTED?

11:17.372 --> 11:18.895
WE EXCHANGED A FEW
HEATED WORDS

11:18.939 --> 11:20.723
YEARS AGO
WHEN HE POACHED

11:20.767 --> 11:22.856
ONE OF MY MOST
VALUED EMPLOYEES.

11:22.899 --> 11:24.727
IF YOUR EMPLOYEE
ALLOWED HIMSELF

11:24.771 --> 11:26.337
TO BE POACHED,

11:26.381 --> 11:28.035
HE MUST'VE FELT
UNDERVALUED.

11:30.124 --> 11:31.995
BUT I'M ASSUMING YOU
DIDN'T FLY 12 BLOCKS

11:32.039 --> 11:33.170
FROM YOUR
CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS

11:33.214 --> 11:34.650
TO OPEN UP
OLD WOUNDS.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.697
NO. I'M HERE
TO ADDRESS A NEW ONE.

11:41.526 --> 11:42.963
THERE WAS AN ILLEGAL BREACH

11:43.006 --> 11:45.530
OF THE JETURIAN
INDUSTRIES SERVERS.

11:45.574 --> 11:48.620
IT WAS A VERY
SOPHISTICATED HACK.

11:48.664 --> 11:50.884
BUT THE CULPRIT
LEFT BEHIND A FEW

11:50.927 --> 11:52.755
DIGITAL BREAD CRUMBS,

11:52.799 --> 11:54.061
AND WE FOLLOWED THEM BACK

11:54.104 --> 11:55.540
TO AN IP ADDRESS

11:55.584 --> 11:58.282
BELONGING TO
WAYNE ENTERPRISES.

11:59.675 --> 12:00.981
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE?

12:01.024 --> 12:02.939
WELL, IT DEPENDS.

12:02.983 --> 12:04.549
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT?

12:06.856 --> 12:08.379
BECAUSE I THINK
CORPORATE ESPIONAGE

12:08.423 --> 12:09.424
IS MORE THAN
ENOUGH REASON

12:09.467 --> 12:10.904
TO HAVE A LITTLE CHAT.

12:10.947 --> 12:12.732
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

12:12.775 --> 12:14.559
MM. IGNORANCE OF

12:14.603 --> 12:15.822
WHAT'S GOING ON
IN YOUR COMPANY

12:15.865 --> 12:17.345
DOESN'T PASS FOR
BUSINESS ACUMEN.

12:17.388 --> 12:19.042
IF YOU HAD PROOF,

12:19.086 --> 12:22.089
YOU'D BE TALKING
TO THE SEC, NOT ME.

12:25.396 --> 12:26.441
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

12:29.183 --> 12:30.401
BECAUSE I DIDN'T
FORGE MY COMPANY

12:30.445 --> 12:33.100
INTO A MULTINATIONAL
CONGLOMERATE

12:33.143 --> 12:34.579
TO HAVE SOMEONE SWOOP IN

12:34.623 --> 12:35.885
AND STEAL MY LIFE'S WORK.

12:37.060 --> 12:39.410
AND BECAUSE...

12:39.454 --> 12:40.455
I BELIEVE WARNINGS ARE

12:40.498 --> 12:42.587
BEST DELIVERED DIRECTLY.

12:42.631 --> 12:43.806
AND I'LL ONLY GIVE ONE.

12:45.242 --> 12:47.810
STAY OUT OF MY BUSINESS.

12:47.854 --> 12:49.290
THAT WON'T BE
A PROBLEM.

12:52.728 --> 12:54.208
AND I THINK YOU SHOULD
DROP THE "ACTING"

12:54.251 --> 12:55.600
FROM YOUR JOB TITLE.

12:55.644 --> 12:57.733
DENYING YOU KNEW
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS...

12:59.039 --> 13:00.780
WAS NOT YOUR
BEST PERFORMANCE.

13:14.881 --> 13:16.665
YOUR DAD PROGRAMMED
YOUR SUIT'S AI

13:16.708 --> 13:19.189
TO SPEAK WITH
HIS VOICE?

13:19.233 --> 13:21.235
UH, DAD,
SAY HELLO TO MARY.

13:21.278 --> 13:23.541
HELLO, MARY.

13:26.588 --> 13:27.632
GIVE IT A TRY.

13:28.938 --> 13:31.462
MR. FOX? HI.

13:33.073 --> 13:34.378
WHAT WAS LUKE LIKE
AS A KID?

13:34.422 --> 13:36.641
CALLING UP
PHOTO RECORDS

13:36.685 --> 13:38.382
FOR LUCAS FOX,
AGE 6.

13:38.426 --> 13:40.471
DAD, BELAY THAT
REQUEST, PLEASE.

13:41.908 --> 13:44.345
IT'S LIKE YOU CAN
TALK TO HIM AGAIN.

13:44.388 --> 13:47.130
IT'S...IT'S AMAZING.

13:47.174 --> 13:48.610
IT WOULD BE MORE AMAZING
IF THE SUIT DIDN'T

13:48.653 --> 13:50.438
TURN OFF AT THE WORST
POSSIBLE TIMES.

13:50.481 --> 13:52.744
ANY GUESSES WHY?

13:52.788 --> 13:53.963
ACCORDING TO
THIS DIAGNOSTIC,

13:54.007 --> 13:55.182
THE SUIT'S FAILSAFE
GOT TRIPPED,

13:55.225 --> 13:56.966
CAUSING IT
TO SHUT DOWN.

13:57.010 --> 13:58.794
- WHAT TRIPPED IT?
- WELL, THE SUIT TRACKS

13:58.838 --> 13:59.969
ALL KINDS OF
MEDICAL DATA--

14:00.013 --> 14:01.753
BIOMETRICS,
EYE MOVEMENT,

14:01.797 --> 14:04.408
ELECTROMAGNETIC IMPULSES
TO THE BRAIN,
HEART RATE.

14:04.452 --> 14:05.888
IT'S JUST
CONSTANTLY MONITORING

14:05.932 --> 14:07.150
THE HEALTH STATUS OF
THE PERSON WEARING IT.

14:08.412 --> 14:09.849
IF I'M READING
THIS RIGHT,

14:09.892 --> 14:11.328
THE SUIT THOUGHT
YOU WERE INJURED.

14:11.372 --> 14:12.939
YEAH, WHICH PROMPTED
A SYSTEM-WIDE SHUTDOWN,

14:12.982 --> 14:14.636
PUTTING THE SUIT
IN SAFE MODE.

14:16.072 --> 14:17.769
TURNING OFF IN
THE MIDDLE OF A FIGHT

14:17.813 --> 14:19.423
BECAUSE IT THINKS YOU
NEED MEDICAL ASSISTANCE

14:19.467 --> 14:20.947
SEEMS MORE LIKE
UNSAFE MODE.
YEAH.

14:20.990 --> 14:22.296
WELL, THERE'S A REASON
THAT THIS THING

14:22.339 --> 14:23.732
WAS UNDER A TARP
IN MY DAD'S LAB

14:23.775 --> 14:25.777
AND NOT OUT ON
PATROL IN GOTHAM.

14:25.821 --> 14:29.042
STILL HAVE SOME GLITCHES
TO WORK OUT.

14:29.085 --> 14:32.262
WELL, WHY DON'T WE
START BY MAKING SURE

14:32.306 --> 14:34.134
THERE AREN'T ANY GLITCHES
WITH YOU FIRST.

14:36.310 --> 14:37.615
IF THE SUIT THINKS
YOU'RE INJURED,

14:37.659 --> 14:38.878
LET'S MAKE SURE
YOU'RE NOT.

14:41.706 --> 14:47.451
UHH. UHH. AHH.

15:09.778 --> 15:11.736
SO,

15:11.780 --> 15:13.521
LET'S GET THIS MONSTER.

15:13.564 --> 15:15.784
OH. I THOUGHT
SHE FOUND YOU.

15:15.827 --> 15:17.220
DID I SPY
WITH MY LITTLE EYE

15:17.264 --> 15:18.961
JADA JET'S CHOPPER
ON THE ROOF?

15:25.228 --> 15:27.361
SO, YOU KNEW HER NAME
THIS ENTIRE TIME?

15:27.404 --> 15:29.406
SHE'S KIND OF LIKE
A HELICOPTER PARENT,

15:29.450 --> 15:31.800
JUST WITHOUT
THE PARENT.

15:31.843 --> 15:33.976
I MEAN, REALLY.
WHAT KIND OF MOTHER

15:34.020 --> 15:35.673
ABANDONS THEIR DAUGHTER
TO THE HORRORS

15:35.717 --> 15:37.588
OF THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM
TO LITERALLY

15:37.632 --> 15:38.720
JET-SET AROUND THE GLOBE?

15:38.763 --> 15:41.288
NO. NO.

15:41.331 --> 15:43.594
WE'RE NOT DOING THIS.

15:43.638 --> 15:45.248
RENEE SAID I HAVE
TO WATCH YOU.

15:45.292 --> 15:47.685
IT DOESN'T MEAN I
HAVE TO LISTEN TO YOU.

15:47.729 --> 15:50.036
SO, YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW

15:50.079 --> 15:52.299
WHERE CROC'S GONNA
STRIKE NEXT?

15:54.866 --> 15:55.911
FINE.

15:57.217 --> 15:59.871
WELL, AS
THE RESIDENT EXPERT

15:59.915 --> 16:02.178
ON PREDATORY BEHAVIOR,
I HAD SOME THOUGHTS

16:02.222 --> 16:06.182
ON HOW MR., UH,
CHOOSES HIS PREY.

16:07.488 --> 16:10.360
I WAS THINKING BACK
TO MY FIRST KILL,

16:10.404 --> 16:11.927
FOR WHICH I CHOSE
A GERIATRIC HARPY

16:11.971 --> 16:13.363
WITH AN OXYGEN TANK. NOW,

16:13.407 --> 16:14.930
DO YOU KNOW
WHY I DID THAT?

16:14.974 --> 16:16.410
BECAUSE YOU'RE
A KILLER, ALICE.

16:16.453 --> 16:20.370
NO. WELL, YES, BUT
THAT'S NOT THE TAKEAWAY.

16:20.414 --> 16:24.157
I CHOSE HER
BECAUSE SHE WAS
EASY PICKINGS.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.333
SEE, WHEN
A FLEDGLING PREDATOR

16:26.376 --> 16:27.812
IS LEARNING HOW
TO STALK ITS PREY,

16:27.856 --> 16:29.814
IT SEEKS TO, UM,

16:29.858 --> 16:31.294
SEPARATE ONE
FROM THE HERD.

16:32.861 --> 16:34.210
SO, HE WOULDN'T
HAVE GONE AFTER

16:34.254 --> 16:35.733
TWO VICTIMS FOR
HIS FIRST HUNT.

16:37.344 --> 16:40.086
LOOK AT YOU LEARNING
TO THINK LIKE A KILLER.

16:40.129 --> 16:42.175
WHICH MEANS THE POOL

16:42.218 --> 16:44.351
WASN'T THIS CROC'S
FIRST ATTACK.

16:44.394 --> 16:45.743
AND IF IT WASN'T FOR
ALL THE BLOOD

16:45.787 --> 16:47.136
IN THE DEEP END...

16:47.180 --> 16:48.268
THEY WOULD'VE JUST
BEEN LISTED AS

16:48.311 --> 16:49.660
MISSING PERSONS.

16:49.704 --> 16:51.184
JUST LIKE
THE MISSING PERSONS I FOUND

16:51.227 --> 16:52.750
THAT WERE LAST SEEN

16:52.794 --> 16:54.274
AT THE EAST RIVER SHORE.

16:54.317 --> 16:57.320
A MERE TWO MILES
FROM THE POOL ATTACK.

16:57.364 --> 16:59.105
WELCOME TO HIS
HUNTING GROUND.

17:02.934 --> 17:04.632
AND WITH THE TEAM
TRAILING BY ONE,

17:04.675 --> 17:06.677
AN INCREDIBLE CROSS-FIELD PASS
FROM MEGAN RAPINOE

17:06.721 --> 17:08.331
TO ROOKIE SENSATION
WHITNEY HUTCHINSON,

17:08.375 --> 17:09.680
WHO FAKES OUT THE LAST DEFENDER,

17:09.724 --> 17:12.248
AND SHE'S ON BREAKAWAY...

17:12.292 --> 17:13.467
AND SCORES!

17:13.510 --> 17:15.077
THE CROWD GOES WILD.

17:15.121 --> 17:16.731
WE'RE ALL TIED UP WITH
MINUTES LEFT IN THE GAME.

17:16.774 --> 17:17.862
WHICH THE REFS
ARE CALLING

17:17.906 --> 17:19.168
ON ACCOUNT OF DARKNESS.

17:19.212 --> 17:20.430
- MOM!
- MM-MM.

17:20.474 --> 17:21.562
ARGUING WITH THE REF
WILL GET YOU

17:21.605 --> 17:22.693
A YELLOW CARD.

17:23.955 --> 17:25.044
FINE.

18:01.123 --> 18:02.168
GROSS.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.012
AAH!

18:27.367 --> 18:28.672
ACCORDING
TO THE 911 CALL,

18:28.716 --> 18:30.326
YOU'RE RIGHT IN THE AREA WHERE

18:30.370 --> 18:31.632
THE MISSING GIRL'S MOTHER
SAID SHE WAS PLAYING.

18:31.675 --> 18:33.416
GCPD'S EN ROUTE.

18:33.460 --> 18:35.375
WELL, THEY'LL FIND

18:35.418 --> 18:36.941
ABOUT AS MUCH AS WE HAVE,

18:36.985 --> 18:38.421
WHICH ISN'T MUCH.

18:38.465 --> 18:40.119
THERE HAS TO BE SOME SIGN
OF HER THERE.

18:41.990 --> 18:44.035
DRAG MARKS LEAD OFF
IN THAT DIRECTION.

18:44.079 --> 18:45.950
BUT THERE'S NO
BODY PARTS, NO BLOOD.

18:45.994 --> 18:47.387
HE DIDN'T FEED
ON HER HERE.

18:47.430 --> 18:49.258
WHICH IS UNDERSTANDABLE,
GIVEN HE DID JUST

18:49.302 --> 18:51.042
FEAST ON ALL-YOU-
CAN-EAT COEDS.

18:51.086 --> 18:54.176
THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF
SECRETION, SOPHIE.

18:54.220 --> 18:55.830
DIDN'T YOU SAY O.G.
KILLER CROC'S SALIVA

18:55.873 --> 18:57.527
CONTAINED A
PARALYTIC AGENT?

18:57.571 --> 18:59.355
THAT'S HOW HE
SUBDUED HIS VICTIMS.

18:59.399 --> 19:01.270
AND THEN STASH THEM
AWAY FOR LATER.

19:02.489 --> 19:03.881
IT'S BASICALLY LIKE
A CROC-PANTRY,

19:03.925 --> 19:05.405
FOR WHEN HE WANTS
A DOGGY-BAG.

19:05.448 --> 19:07.015
OK, THEN WE NEED TO FIND
WHERE HE STASHED HER,

19:07.058 --> 19:08.364
BECAUSE THAT GIRL
COULD STILL BE ALIVE.

19:10.714 --> 19:11.759
YEAH.

19:13.369 --> 19:15.284
UNTIL HE GETS HUNGRY.

19:16.546 --> 19:19.506
IS THAT CROC SKIN?

19:19.549 --> 19:23.162
IT APPEARS OUR CROC
IS A...GROWING BOY.

19:33.128 --> 19:34.434
AAH!

19:49.100 --> 19:52.147
AAH! OH!

20:21.568 --> 20:24.571
SO, WHAT WAS
SHE LIKE? MOMMY.

20:24.614 --> 20:26.225
SHE WAS AMAZING.

20:26.268 --> 20:27.965
AND THEN YOU
TOOK HER FROM ME.

20:28.009 --> 20:29.924
I MEANT BIRTH MOMMY.

20:31.404 --> 20:32.535
BUT IF IT'LL
BREAK THE ICE,

20:32.579 --> 20:34.058
I'LL TELL YOU
ABOUT MY MOM.

20:34.102 --> 20:35.669
SHE HAD A REALLY GREAT
HEAD ON HER SHOULDERS.

20:35.712 --> 20:37.148
EMPHASIS ON
THE WORD "HAD."

20:37.192 --> 20:38.411
WHY DO YOU CARE?

20:38.454 --> 20:40.151
WHY DO YOU KEEP
PRETENDING NOT TO?

20:40.195 --> 20:41.283
SURELY YOU
GREW UP WONDERING

20:41.327 --> 20:42.937
WHAT SHE WAS LIKE, AND

20:42.980 --> 20:45.200
SEEING AS FATE,
OTHERWISE KNOWN AS ME,

20:45.244 --> 20:47.028
HAS BROUGHT YOU TOGETHER,
I THINK I AT LEAST

20:47.071 --> 20:49.291
DESERVE TO KNOW THAT
MY EFFORTS HAVE PAID OFF.

20:49.335 --> 20:52.599
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT JADA WAS LIKE?

20:52.642 --> 20:54.818
SHE WAS AMAZING.

20:54.862 --> 20:57.125
SHE WAS
CONFIDENT, DIRECT,

20:57.168 --> 20:58.431
FEARLESS, UNAPOLOGETIC.

20:58.474 --> 21:00.041
SHE WAS A
FREAKING MASTERCLASS

21:00.084 --> 21:01.260
IN TAKING WHAT'S HERS.

21:01.303 --> 21:03.523
AND LETTING IT
GO, APPARENTLY.

21:03.566 --> 21:04.785
DID IT HURT
ALL THE MORE KNOWING

21:04.828 --> 21:07.353
SHE DIDN'T WANT YOU
IN HER LIFE?

21:07.396 --> 21:10.921
NO. BECAUSE I DON'T
WANT HER IN MINE.

21:10.965 --> 21:12.575
SHE DOESN'T EVEN
KNOW WHO I AM,

21:12.619 --> 21:14.969
BUT I KNOW WHO SHE IS
AND I DON'T NEED HER.

21:15.012 --> 21:17.232
NOW SHUT UP AND HELP
ME FIND THE TRAIL.

21:18.755 --> 21:21.758
ACTUALLY...I THINK WE JUST
FOUND WHERE IT ENDS.

21:38.471 --> 21:39.559
YOU FIRST.

21:40.821 --> 21:42.518
ME? THE ONE WHO'S

21:42.562 --> 21:44.390
NOT WEARING IMPENETRABLE
TACTICAL ARMOR?

21:44.433 --> 21:46.348
THAT'S WHO YOU WANT
TAKING POINT?

21:46.392 --> 21:48.307
I'M NOT LETTING YOU
OUT OF MY SIGHT, ALICE.

21:49.743 --> 21:51.179
DO YOU REALLY THINK
I'M GONNA RUN?

21:51.222 --> 21:52.876
DO YOU REALLY THINK
I'M GOING TO BELIEVE

21:52.920 --> 21:54.922
THAT YOU GIVE A DAMN
ABOUT STOPPING THIS CROC?

21:54.965 --> 21:56.358
YES. I THINK
YOU'RE GONNA RUN

21:56.402 --> 21:57.751
THE FIRST CHANCE
YOU GET.

21:57.794 --> 21:58.839
SO, IT'S MY JOB
NOT TO

21:58.882 --> 22:00.362
GIVE YOU ANY CHANCES.

22:00.406 --> 22:01.711
OH, THAT'S FUNNY.
I THOUGHT IT WAS YOUR JOB

22:01.755 --> 22:03.409
TO SAVE A LITTLE GIRL.

22:03.452 --> 22:04.714
DON'T ACT LIKE YOU'RE HERE

22:04.758 --> 22:06.194
TO DO THE GOOD
DEED, ALICE.

22:06.237 --> 22:07.369
YOU ONLY THINK
ABOUT YOURSELF,

22:07.413 --> 22:08.588
SO, DON'T YOU
DARE USE

22:08.631 --> 22:09.589
THAT LITTLE GIRL
AS CAMOUFLAGE.

22:09.632 --> 22:12.505
I WAS THAT LITTLE GIRL.

22:12.548 --> 22:14.115
DON'T ACT LIKE
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE

22:14.158 --> 22:15.334
WITH ABANDONMENT ISSUES.

22:15.377 --> 22:16.639
I WILL NOT GIVE UP
ON THIS GIRL

22:16.683 --> 22:19.338
THE WAY EVERYONE
GAVE UP ON ME.

22:34.048 --> 22:37.268
UCCH! THAT SMELL.

22:37.312 --> 22:38.357
ROTTING MEAT.

22:40.010 --> 22:41.664
KINDA TAKES ME BACK
TO MY CHILDHOOD.

22:41.708 --> 22:43.492
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

22:46.321 --> 22:47.366
BAIT.

22:51.457 --> 22:52.632
THIS MEANS WE'RE
NOT THE ONLY ONE

22:52.675 --> 22:53.894
HUNTING THIS MONSTER.

22:55.417 --> 22:56.679
HE'S NOT A MONSTER.

23:01.554 --> 23:02.685
HE'S MY SON.

23:06.863 --> 23:09.344
THIS FEELS
A BIT UNNECESSARY.

23:09.388 --> 23:10.389
I'M FINE.

23:11.738 --> 23:15.394
WELL, YOU'RE KEEPING FIT.

23:15.437 --> 23:19.833
IN...MY OFFICIAL,
PROFESSIONAL

23:19.876 --> 23:22.183
MEDICAL OPINION.

23:26.187 --> 23:27.710
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT YOUR HEART RATE.

23:32.933 --> 23:34.238
IT LOOKS GOOD.

23:34.282 --> 23:35.849
LET'S HAVE A LISTEN
TO YOUR LUNGS.

23:43.726 --> 23:45.075
GOOD BREATH SOUNDS.

23:49.558 --> 23:53.301
MM. YOUR HEART RATE
IS RISING.

23:57.871 --> 24:00.787
RISING...

24:00.830 --> 24:03.920
STILL RISING.

24:03.964 --> 24:05.922
NOW IT'S RACING.

24:05.966 --> 24:07.358
LUKE, ARE YOU OK?

24:10.840 --> 24:12.494
I--I--YEAH, YEAH.

24:12.538 --> 24:14.801
I--I'M JUST--
I'M TICKLISH

24:14.844 --> 24:16.629
AND YOUR HANDS
ARE COLD.

24:16.672 --> 24:18.239
YEAH. YEAH.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.676
YOU'RE RIGHT. I--

24:21.851 --> 24:23.592
YOU'RE TOTALLY FINE.

24:25.855 --> 24:29.816
TOTALLY--YOU'RE TOTALLY
FEELING FINE.

24:33.472 --> 24:34.821
YOU CAN PUT
YOUR SHIRT BACK ON.

24:34.864 --> 24:36.083
YEAH. OK.

24:36.126 --> 24:37.214
IF YOU WANT.

24:39.216 --> 24:40.261
YOU SHOULD.

24:41.436 --> 24:44.744
UH...YEAH.
SO, LIKE I SAID,

24:44.787 --> 24:47.573
IT'S JUST A PROBLEM
WITH THE SUIT.

24:47.616 --> 24:51.228
AHH. YEAH.
MUST BE.

24:53.317 --> 24:55.145
YOU THINK YOU CAN
FIX IT?

24:55.189 --> 24:56.712
YEAH. YEAH.
IT SHOULD BE EASY.

24:56.756 --> 24:59.062
I JUST NEED TO
OVERRIDE THE FAILSAFE.

25:01.412 --> 25:04.285
ARE YOU SURE THAT
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA?

25:04.328 --> 25:06.200
I MEAN, ISN'T THE POINT
OF A FAILSAFE

25:06.243 --> 25:07.680
TO KEEP YOU SAFE
WHEN THE SUIT FAILS?

25:07.723 --> 25:09.333
WHAT IF IT'S JUST
TRYING TO PROTECT YOU?

25:09.377 --> 25:11.553
I THINK IT'S BEING
A LITTLE OVERPROTECTIVE.

25:11.597 --> 25:13.599
KIND OF REMINDS ME
OF A CERTAIN

25:13.642 --> 25:15.252
NEWLY MINTED DOCTOR
THAT I KNOW.

25:21.607 --> 25:23.783
MY BOY DIDN'T MEAN
TO HURT THOSE PEOPLE.

25:23.826 --> 25:24.914
I'M SURE HE DIDN'T.

25:24.958 --> 25:27.003
HE'S NOT A KILLER.

25:27.047 --> 25:28.178
UNLIKE THAT ONE.

25:30.616 --> 25:32.922
I WASN'T EXPECTING TO
FIND ANYBODY DOWN HERE,

25:32.966 --> 25:34.576
MUCH LESS A PAIR
OF CELEBRITIES.

25:34.620 --> 25:36.447
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TWO
DOING TOGETHER, ANYWAY?

25:36.491 --> 25:38.537
AREN'T Y'ALL SUPPOSED
TO BE ENEMIES?

25:38.580 --> 25:41.017
LONG STORY.
SHE'S WORKING WITH ME.

25:41.061 --> 25:42.236
THEY'RE A LITTLE
SHORT-STAFFED

25:42.279 --> 25:43.629
AT CITY HALL.
THAT'S WHY.

25:43.672 --> 25:45.108
WE WANT TO HELP
YOUR SON.

25:45.152 --> 25:46.153
WHY DON'T YOU START
BY TELLING US

25:46.196 --> 25:47.241
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?

25:50.505 --> 25:52.028
IT'S PROBABLY BETTER
I SHOW YOU.

25:54.727 --> 25:56.424
JUST BEFORE STEVEN

25:56.467 --> 25:57.947
WAS HEADING OFF TO COLLEGE,

25:57.991 --> 25:59.775
WE WENT ON A FATHER-SON
FISHING TRIP.

25:59.819 --> 26:03.083
HE HOOKED A BLUEGILL
ON HIS VERY FIRST CAST.

26:03.126 --> 26:04.954
BUT WHEN WE CUT THAT THING OPEN,

26:04.998 --> 26:07.000
THERE WAS SOMETHING
MIGHTY WEIRD INSIDE.

26:07.043 --> 26:08.479
LET ME GUESS.

26:08.523 --> 26:11.265
A RATHER LARGE
CROCODILE TOOTH?

26:11.308 --> 26:14.355
YEAH. STEVEN THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE COOL

26:14.398 --> 26:16.531
TO MAKE IT INTO
A NECKLACE.

26:18.185 --> 26:19.795
BUT HE CUT HIMSELF
ON THE TOOTH.

26:19.839 --> 26:22.102
CUT GOT INFECTED.

26:22.145 --> 26:25.932
THEN STEVEN...STARTED CHANGING.

26:27.368 --> 26:30.284
TRIED DOCTORS.

26:30.327 --> 26:31.938
NONE OF THEM KNEW
WHAT IT WAS.

26:31.981 --> 26:33.592
THEY COULDN'T STOP THE CHANGES.

26:33.635 --> 26:36.638
EVERY DAY, THERE WAS
A LITTLE LESS STEVEN

26:36.682 --> 26:40.381
AND A LITTLE MORE...CREATURE.

26:42.122 --> 26:44.603
AND THAT'S WHEN THE
APPETITE TOOK HOLD OF HIM.

26:44.646 --> 26:48.824
AND I HAD TO CHAIN HIM UP.
BUT HE WAS JUST TOO STRONG.

26:48.868 --> 26:51.392
TOO HUNGRY.
HE BROKE FREE.

26:52.915 --> 26:54.221
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO LURE HIM BACK.

26:55.701 --> 26:57.311
YOU REALLY ROLLED OUT
THE RED CARPET FOR HIM.

26:58.617 --> 27:01.576
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.491
BUT WE REALLY DO WANT
TO HELP YOUR SON,

27:03.534 --> 27:05.319
AND WE HAVE TO START
BY MAKING SURE

27:05.362 --> 27:07.800
HE DOESN'T HURT
THAT LITTLE GIRL
OR ANYONE ELSE.

27:07.843 --> 27:09.279
YEAH, BUT I JUST
DON'T THINK HE'S GONNA

27:09.323 --> 27:10.803
AGREE TO BEING LOCKED UP AGAIN.

27:14.894 --> 27:16.939
THAT'S WHERE THIS COMES IN.

27:16.983 --> 27:19.594
YOU THINK THAT THING'S
STRONG ENOUGH FOR HIM?

27:19.638 --> 27:23.337
YEAH. BUT IT'S NOT FOR HIM.

27:23.380 --> 27:24.860
IT'S FOR YOU.

27:24.904 --> 27:25.948
AAH!

27:30.431 --> 27:32.085
I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU
HURT MY BOY.

27:32.128 --> 27:36.045
AAH! OH!

27:41.224 --> 27:42.661
BATWOMAN, I'M READING
A HUGE POWER SPIKE.

27:42.704 --> 27:43.792
IS EVERYTHING OK?

27:45.707 --> 27:47.187
BATWOMAN, DO YOU READ ME?

27:49.102 --> 27:50.364
BATWOMAN!

27:53.846 --> 27:56.544
I'M SORRY.
I REALLY AM.

27:56.587 --> 27:57.893
BUT MY BOY'S
SUFFERED ENOUGH

27:57.937 --> 27:59.721
WITHOUT YOU
ADDING TO IT.

28:04.813 --> 28:07.555
I JUST WANT TO GET HIM
THE HELP HE NEEDS.

28:07.598 --> 28:09.383
YEAH. YOUR IDEA
OF HELPING STEVIE

28:09.426 --> 28:10.819
IS TAKING HIM AWAY FROM ME.

28:10.863 --> 28:13.517
LOCKING HIM IN A CAGE,
OR WORSE.

28:13.561 --> 28:15.041
JAB HIM WITH NEEDLES.

28:15.084 --> 28:16.564
DISSECT HIM LIKE HE'S
SOME KIND OF LAB ANIMAL.

28:24.354 --> 28:25.965
I'M HIS FATHER

28:26.008 --> 28:27.836
AND I'M GONNA DO
WHATEVER I NEED TO DO

28:27.880 --> 28:29.533
TO KEEP HIM SAFE.

28:29.577 --> 28:31.710
EVEN IF THAT MEANS--

28:36.715 --> 28:41.850
STEVIE, IT'S YOUR DAD.
STEVIE, NOOOO!

28:41.894 --> 28:43.939
NO!

28:47.900 --> 28:49.640
THAT IS YOUR SON, YEAH.

28:55.037 --> 28:56.299
ARE YOU OK?

28:56.343 --> 28:59.433
YEAH. I JUST
NEED A MINUTE.

28:59.476 --> 29:00.651
OH, THAT'S GOOD.

29:00.695 --> 29:01.783
'CAUSE THAT'S
ALL I NEED.

29:06.701 --> 29:07.789
SUCKAS.

29:13.360 --> 29:14.491
ONE MINUTE I HAD HER
AND THEN

29:14.535 --> 29:15.710
EVERYTHING WENT DEAD.

29:15.754 --> 29:16.711
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO RAISE HER

29:16.755 --> 29:18.104
BUT I CAN'T EVEN--

29:18.147 --> 29:19.801
BATCAVE. COME IN.

29:19.845 --> 29:21.977
BATWOMAN, WE READ YOU.
WHAT HAPPENED?

29:22.021 --> 29:23.892
EXACTLY WHAT I SAID
WOULD HAPPEN.

29:25.241 --> 29:27.940
ALICE ESCAPED.
AND I CAN'T HUNT HER DOWN

29:27.983 --> 29:29.637
AND SAVE A LITTLE GIRL.

29:29.680 --> 29:31.334
BATWING, YOU READY TO
GET BACK TO THE FIELD?

29:31.378 --> 29:33.162
YEAH. I'M GOOD TO GO.

29:33.206 --> 29:35.034
SO, YOU AND MARY FIXED
WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE SUIT.

29:38.951 --> 29:42.084
UM...YES.
BATWING IS ALL CLEAR.

29:43.564 --> 29:45.435
GOOD.
ALICE WAS LAST HEADED

29:45.479 --> 29:48.395
NORTH THROUGH THE SEWER TUNNELS.

29:48.438 --> 29:50.571
IF SHE'S ON FOOT,
SHE'S GONNA WANNA CHANGE THAT.

29:50.614 --> 29:52.834
THERE'S A TRUCK DEPOT A FEW
MILES ON THAT TRAJECTORY.

29:52.878 --> 29:54.183
THAT'S WHERE I'D HEAD.

29:54.227 --> 29:55.837
I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.

29:55.881 --> 29:57.056
WE NEED TO FIND ALICE

29:57.099 --> 29:58.971
BEFORE RENEE KNOWS SHE'S GONE.

30:04.933 --> 30:06.805
HELP! SOMEBODY!

30:08.763 --> 30:10.330
PLEASE, PLEASE.

30:23.517 --> 30:24.866
OH, THANK GOD.

30:24.910 --> 30:26.128
I THOUGHT THAT THING
WAS GONNA COME BACK.

30:26.172 --> 30:27.434
AND HE PROBABLY
WILL DO SO, HON.

30:27.477 --> 30:29.436
UP AND AT 'EM.
WE GOTTA SKEDADDLE.

30:29.479 --> 30:30.654
I CAN'T WALK.

30:30.698 --> 30:32.482
YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO TRY.

30:32.526 --> 30:34.920
BUT MY LEG IS BROKEN.

30:36.573 --> 30:39.228
...HEY, HON.

30:39.272 --> 30:41.317
I'M ON A REALLY TIGHT
SCHEDULE HERE, SO,

30:41.361 --> 30:42.841
YOU AND I THREE-LEGGED
RACING OUTTA HERE

30:42.884 --> 30:46.061
IS REALLY GONNA
SLOW ME DOWN.

30:46.105 --> 30:48.020
NO, NO.
YOU HAVE TO HELP ME.

30:58.769 --> 31:01.511
FINE. I'M GONNA HELP YOU.

31:02.948 --> 31:04.079
BY TEACHING YOU
THE LESSON THAT

31:04.123 --> 31:05.341
I HAD TO LEARN
THE HARD WAY.

31:06.734 --> 31:10.390
NO ONE IS GONNA
SAVE YOU EXCEPT YOURSELF.

31:10.433 --> 31:13.741
YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE
YOU CAN COUNT ON.

31:15.743 --> 31:18.224
THE SOONER YOU LEARN THAT,

31:18.267 --> 31:20.052
THE BETTER OFF YOU'LL BE.

31:20.095 --> 31:21.401
NO.

31:23.316 --> 31:25.013
YOU'RE GONNA THANK ME
FOR THIS ONE DAY.

31:27.929 --> 31:31.063
NO! NO!
HELP ME, PLEASE!

31:31.106 --> 31:34.022
DON'T LEAVE ME--
DON'T LEAVE ME, PLEASE!

31:38.026 --> 31:39.898
I KNOW
YOU'RE OUT THERE, STEVEN,

31:39.941 --> 31:41.464
AND I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR ME.

31:41.508 --> 31:42.944
THERE IS STILL SOME OF YOU

31:42.988 --> 31:45.338
LEFT IN THERE THAT
CAN UNDERSTAND ME.

31:45.381 --> 31:47.688
OK? I DO NOT WANT TO HURT YOU.

31:47.731 --> 31:48.950
I JUST WANT TO HELP YOU.

31:50.299 --> 31:52.562
AND YOUR FATHER, HE JUST
WANTS TO HELP YOU, TOO.

31:54.782 --> 31:55.957
HE REALLY LOVES YOU.

31:57.176 --> 31:59.700
AND TRUST ME--YOU ARE
REALLY LUCKY

31:59.743 --> 32:01.006
TO HAVE A PARENT LIKE THAT.

32:02.921 --> 32:06.272
SOMEONE THAT WOULD DO
ANYTHING TO PROTECT YOU.

32:08.578 --> 32:13.583
AND NEVER GIVE UP ON YOU.
NO MATTER WHAT.

32:15.759 --> 32:18.893
SO MUCH FOR

32:18.937 --> 32:20.242
TRYING TO REASON WITH YOU.

32:30.339 --> 32:33.081
MONTOYA.
WE GOT A PROBLEM.

32:33.125 --> 32:34.126
JUST LOST
THE SIGNAL FROM

32:34.169 --> 32:35.431
ALICE'S TRACKING MONITOR.

32:37.216 --> 32:38.608
DEFINE "LOST."

32:38.652 --> 32:39.609
ONE MOMENT IT'S READING
LOUD AND CLEAR.

32:39.653 --> 32:41.089
THE NEXT, NOTHING.

32:41.133 --> 32:43.048
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
NO ONE'S EVER MANAGED

32:43.091 --> 32:44.266
TO CIRCUMVENT
ONE OF THOSE THINGS.

32:44.310 --> 32:46.486
TELL THAT TO ALICE.

32:46.529 --> 32:48.053
THIS MEANS SHE COULD
BE ANYWHERE.

33:05.635 --> 33:10.466
OH, GREAT.
THE SIDEKICK.

33:12.077 --> 33:13.339
IT'S BATWING.

33:13.382 --> 33:15.210
OOH. COOL NAME.

33:16.646 --> 33:18.300
NOW LET'S SEE IF
YOU CAN LIVE UP TO IT.

33:28.702 --> 33:30.399
UHH!

33:30.443 --> 33:32.575
HOW'S THE SUIT, LUKE?
ANY PROBLEMS?

33:32.619 --> 33:34.273
JUST THIS DISTRACTING
VOICE IN MY EAR.

33:47.373 --> 33:49.375
DID YOU REALLY THINK
YOU COULD BEAT ME?

33:49.418 --> 33:50.550
WHY WOULD I NEED
TO BEAT YOU?

33:50.593 --> 33:51.855
WE'RE ON THE SAME TEAM,

33:51.899 --> 33:52.943
WHETHER WE
LIKE IT OR NOT.

33:58.210 --> 33:59.602
WAS SOMETHING SUPPOSED
TO HAPPEN?

33:59.646 --> 34:01.082
IT ALREADY HAS.
RIGHT NOW,

34:01.126 --> 34:02.518
1,000 NANOBOTS ARE

34:02.562 --> 34:03.693
SWIMMING THROUGH
YOUR BLOODSTREAM,

34:03.737 --> 34:04.999
SENDING OUT
TRACKING BEACONS

34:05.043 --> 34:06.392
TO SATELLITES
AS WE SPEAK.

34:06.435 --> 34:08.089
SO, IF YOU WANNA RUN,

34:08.133 --> 34:09.308
YOU BETTER BE
REALLY FAST.

34:55.136 --> 34:56.137
UHH!

34:57.660 --> 34:59.401
UHH! UHH!

35:09.977 --> 35:11.021
UHH!

35:25.993 --> 35:28.038
YOU OK?

35:30.302 --> 35:32.304
IT'S OK.

35:32.347 --> 35:33.522
I GOT YOU.

35:34.958 --> 35:36.046
I GOT YOU.

35:40.616 --> 35:42.052
I THOUGHT I LOST YOU.

35:59.374 --> 36:00.984
CONGRATULATIONS.

36:01.028 --> 36:03.248
I SEE YOU'VE
STOPPED THE CROC,

36:03.291 --> 36:04.684
SECURED THE TOOTH,

36:04.727 --> 36:06.903
REUNITED A MISSING GIRL
WITH HER MOTHER,

36:06.947 --> 36:09.906
BUT...WHAT I DON'T SEE
IS YOUR PARTNER.

36:12.257 --> 36:14.389
SHE'S OVER THERE.

36:14.433 --> 36:15.651
WAITING FOR YOU
TO CHAUFFEUR HER

36:15.695 --> 36:16.739
BACK TO ARKHAM.

36:19.133 --> 36:21.875
HAD SOME TECHNICAL
DIFFICULTIES WITH THAT,

36:21.918 --> 36:23.050
BUT I THINK WE'VE FOUND

36:23.093 --> 36:24.965
A BETTER SOLUTION.

36:27.620 --> 36:28.708
RIGHT, ALICE?

36:36.716 --> 36:38.631
LEAPIN' LIZARDS, GOTHAM!

36:38.674 --> 36:41.808
YOU CAN ADD "BAT" TO
THE LIST OF APEX PREDATORS,

36:41.851 --> 36:43.766
BECAUSE BATWOMAN
JUST TOOK A BITE

36:43.810 --> 36:45.464
OUT OF CROC 2.0.

36:45.507 --> 36:48.336
THE RAMPAGING REPTILE
HAS BEEN RELOCATED

36:48.380 --> 36:51.209
TO THE NOT-SO-NATURAL HABITAT
OF ARKHAM ASYLUM,

36:51.252 --> 36:52.253
WHERE I'M ASSUMING THE GUARDS'

36:52.297 --> 36:53.689
HAZARD PAY JUST WENT UP.

36:53.733 --> 36:55.169
THANKS TO THE CAPED CRUSADER,

36:55.213 --> 36:56.997
THE CROC WAS DENIED
HIS LAST MEAL

36:57.040 --> 36:59.042
AND MISSING GIRL
WHITNEY HUTCHINSON

36:59.086 --> 37:01.567
WAS REUNITED WITH HER MOTHER
IN A REUNION THAT HAD

37:01.610 --> 37:04.526
EVEN THE LIKES OF YOURS TRULY
A LITTLE WEEPY.

37:04.570 --> 37:06.049
REST ASSURED, GOTHAM,

37:06.093 --> 37:07.964
THESE WERE NOT CROCODILE TEARS.

37:19.585 --> 37:22.414
YOU KNOW...
IF YOU SQUINT,

37:22.457 --> 37:23.806
YOU CAN
JUST MAKE OUT

37:23.850 --> 37:24.894
JETURIAN INDUSTRIES
FROM HERE.

37:26.722 --> 37:28.071
I LIKED IT BETTER
WHEN I DIDN'T KNOW

37:28.115 --> 37:29.159
SHE WAS THERE.

37:32.946 --> 37:34.861
I'M SORRY.

37:34.904 --> 37:37.429
I SHOULD'VE NEVER
TOLD YOU.

37:37.472 --> 37:39.300
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

37:39.344 --> 37:44.392
IT'S NOBODY FAULT.
EXCEPT HERS.

37:46.351 --> 37:47.874
YOU KNOW WHAT
I CAN'T GET OVER?

37:50.180 --> 37:52.008
SHE PAID A DOCTOR
$2 MILLION

37:52.052 --> 37:53.488
TO FALSIFY HER
RECORDS SO NO ONE

37:53.532 --> 37:55.011
WOULD EVER KNOW
I WAS HERS.

37:57.536 --> 37:59.668
WHAT KIND OF MOM
DOES THAT?

38:05.065 --> 38:07.546
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
HER LIFE WAS LIKE THEN,

38:07.589 --> 38:09.330
OR WHAT SHE WAS
GOING THROUGH,

38:09.374 --> 38:11.071
OR EVEN WHAT
HER OPTIONS WERE.

38:12.638 --> 38:13.856
BUT THERE IS
ONE PERSON WHO CAN

38:13.900 --> 38:15.249
GIVE YOU THOSE ANSWERS.

38:17.599 --> 38:19.384
I DON'T KNOW IF
I WANT TO KNOW THEM.

38:22.300 --> 38:23.692
RYAN, I KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE

38:23.736 --> 38:25.215
TO NEED TO PUT UP
A WALL.

38:26.521 --> 38:28.306
BELIEVE ME,
I'VE LAID A FEW

38:28.349 --> 38:29.611
BRICKS IN MY LIFE.

38:31.831 --> 38:33.311
BUT I ALSO KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE

38:33.354 --> 38:34.573
TO BE A GIRL WHO JUST

38:34.616 --> 38:36.183
WANTS A HUG FROM HER MOM.

38:44.060 --> 38:45.758
WHAT IF SHE DOESN'T
WANT ME AS HER DAUGHTER?

38:49.239 --> 38:50.806
THEN IT'LL BE HER LOSS.

38:52.199 --> 38:53.374
NOT YOURS.

38:58.945 --> 39:00.947
SORRY I BANGED UP
THE SUIT A LITTLE BIT.

39:06.300 --> 39:07.388
DAD?

39:07.432 --> 39:10.086
OHH. WHY ISN'T HE TALKING?

39:11.784 --> 39:12.828
I DON'T KNOW.

39:14.743 --> 39:15.962
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
YOU REMOVED

39:16.005 --> 39:17.137
THE FAILSAFE.

39:19.095 --> 39:22.011
AND I THINK YOU NEED
TO TURN IT BACK ON.

39:22.055 --> 39:23.578
I MANAGED TO PINPOINT
WHERE THE SUIT

39:23.622 --> 39:25.232
STILL THINKS YOU'RE INJURED
AND IT'S THE EXACT

39:25.275 --> 39:26.842
SAME PLACE WHERE
YOU WERE SHOT.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.803
YEAH, BUT THAT
INJURY'S HEALED.

39:30.846 --> 39:32.892
I KNOW.
BUT THANKS TO
THE DESERT ROSE,

39:32.935 --> 39:35.068
YOU DON'T EVEN
- HAVE A SCAR.
- RIGHT.

39:35.111 --> 39:37.636
A PHYSICAL ONE, ANYWAY.

39:38.854 --> 39:41.248
I THINK WHAT THE SUIT
IS INTERPRETING

39:41.291 --> 39:44.033
AS PHYSICAL PAIN
IS ACTUALLY

39:44.077 --> 39:45.383
PSYCHOLOGICAL PAIN.

39:47.646 --> 39:49.430
MARY, COME ON.

39:49.474 --> 39:50.866
THAT'S ABSURD.

39:50.910 --> 39:52.607
IS IT?

39:52.651 --> 39:54.740
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH
SO MUCH.

39:56.045 --> 39:58.831
JUST BECAUSE
YOUR BODY IS HEALED

39:58.874 --> 40:00.093
DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE.

40:02.748 --> 40:04.358
THIS IS A PROBLEM.

40:04.402 --> 40:05.794
BOTANIST IN THE LAB
DOESN'T THINK

40:05.838 --> 40:07.709
THIS VINE IS ONE OF
POISON IVY'S.

40:07.753 --> 40:09.319
ONLY WAY TO BE
100% SURE IS

40:09.363 --> 40:10.756
TO RUN TESTS ON IT,

40:10.799 --> 40:12.279
BUT THE ONLY WAY
TO DO THAT...

40:13.715 --> 40:15.674
IS TO OPEN IT.

40:15.717 --> 40:17.023
BUT HE WASN'T
WILLING TO DO THAT.

40:40.873 --> 40:42.570
HOW'D YOU KNOW IT
WASN'T THE REAL THING?

40:42.614 --> 40:45.268
BECAUSE I'VE SEEN IT
UP CLOSE.

40:45.312 --> 40:47.270
AND IF THE REAL THING
IS STILL OUT THERE...

40:50.796 --> 40:51.971
GOD HELP US.

40:58.412 --> 41:00.675
WAIT. EXCUSE ME. MISS.

41:00.719 --> 41:03.504
I'M AFRAID YOU CAN'T
JUST GO IN THERE.

41:03.548 --> 41:04.679
I'M SORRY, MS. JET.

41:04.723 --> 41:05.724
SHE JUST WALKED
RIGHT IN.

41:05.767 --> 41:07.682
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

41:07.726 --> 41:08.988
I DROPPED IN
ON MS. WILDER

41:09.031 --> 41:10.685
UNANNOUNCED YESTERDAY.

41:10.729 --> 41:12.208
SHE'S JUST
RETURNING THE FAVOR.

41:19.477 --> 41:21.653
I THOUGHT YOU AND I AGREED

41:21.696 --> 41:24.133
YOU'D STAY OUT OF
MY BUSINESS.

41:24.177 --> 41:25.265
I AM.

41:27.397 --> 41:28.660
THIS IS PERSONAL.

41:31.880 --> 41:33.403
BECAUSE I'M
YOUR DAUGHTER.

42:06.611 --> 42:08.177
GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD.
