01:13.630 --> 01:18.173
Once upon a time there was
a Monkey King called Sun Wukong,

01:18.174 --> 01:21.341
who had remarkable magic powers.

01:21.342 --> 01:25.742
He wreaked havoc in the Heavenly
Palace and angered the Jade Emperor.

01:25.760 --> 01:29.812
Insolent monkey, how dare you violate
Heaven's rules?! Submit, or else!

01:33.732 --> 01:35.822
Hmph! In your face!

01:41.732 --> 01:44.435
Quick, get him!

02:00.420 --> 02:02.168
Nezha to the rescue!

02:48.454 --> 02:50.174
Shoot your arrows!

02:59.267 --> 03:01.267
Down you go!

03:03.941 --> 03:09.643
The Monkey King utterly
destroyed Heaven's Army.

03:09.644 --> 03:15.425
But Buddha could not tolerate his
contempt of the Heavenly Court.

03:19.303 --> 03:24.892
Ever since then, Sun Wukong has been
buried under Wu Xing Mountain,

03:25.135 --> 03:27.965
for almost 500 years.☻

03:30.153 --> 03:33.608
Don't worry, the Great Sage
Equal to Heaven won't die.

03:33.609 --> 03:36.605
He's just asleep.

03:40.588 --> 03:44.709
It'll be dark soon, everybody hurry!

03:45.102 --> 03:48.112
- Yes, we know!
- Good!

03:48.113 --> 03:52.773
Stragglers keep up and mind your step!

04:03.056 --> 04:06.444
It's all right... careful.

04:06.445 --> 04:08.577
Mountain Trolls are coming!

04:09.968 --> 04:11.468
Mountain Trolls!

04:12.205 --> 04:13.706
Quick, downhill!

05:15.541 --> 05:17.168
What's that?

05:21.973 --> 05:24.138
A baby!

05:29.111 --> 05:31.474
Poor child.

05:31.992 --> 05:34.191
Where'd you come from?

05:40.283 --> 05:42.640
Poor baby.

05:43.090 --> 05:46.575
Amitabha* Buddha.

07:12.906 --> 07:15.998
<i>♪ The Great Sage Sun Wukong,</i>

07:19.037 --> 07:22.663
- <i>♪ fights against the Heavenly King.</i>
- Great! Yeah!

07:22.664 --> 07:26.180
- <i>♪ But Sun Wukong is immortal.</i>
- Jiang Liuer!

07:26.668 --> 07:28.445
You again?!

07:29.602 --> 07:32.928
Fa Ming,
look after your disciple!

07:33.961 --> 07:35.809
Don't let me see you again!

07:46.984 --> 07:48.962
Sun Wukong to the rescue!

07:53.002 --> 07:55.566
"You God, whatever your name is"

07:55.567 --> 07:58.993
"Hairy old Jade Emperor,
you'll get a taste of my staff!"

08:06.175 --> 08:10.264
- Shifu*? (Master)
- Liuer, what are you up to?

08:10.265 --> 08:12.775
I'm... begging for alms!

08:16.718 --> 08:19.043
Amitabha Buddha...

08:20.876 --> 08:22.287
Liuer...

08:22.288 --> 08:25.235
I wish you'd stop your fooling
and steady your mind.

08:25.236 --> 08:28.552
Your Shifu* can't take care
of you forever.

08:29.364 --> 08:30.451
Shifu*! (Master)

08:30.452 --> 08:34.418
If we Monks only worry about how to
fill our bellies from day to day,

08:34.419 --> 08:36.722
how are we different from
anyone else?

08:36.724 --> 08:38.005
Sure we're different.

08:38.006 --> 08:41.684
Begging is just the start
of becoming a monk.

08:41.686 --> 08:45.481
"Meditate, chant sutras,
practise Zen..."

08:47.538 --> 08:51.309
"avoid arrogance and rashness,
be natural and spontaneous."

08:51.313 --> 08:55.019
Look at your Shifu*,
don't I look fine?

08:57.629 --> 09:00.054
Mountain Trolls
are causing trouble all over.

09:00.055 --> 09:02.327
Chanting sutras isn't
gonna scare them away.

09:02.328 --> 09:04.483
How would you scare them off?

09:04.484 --> 09:07.787
I wanna learn kick-boxing and
fight the Mountain Trolls.

09:07.788 --> 09:09.189
Shut your mouth!

09:10.617 --> 09:13.433
Jiang Liuer, listen to me carefully.

09:13.434 --> 09:16.760
In order to emancipate all beings
we must start small:

09:16.761 --> 09:19.336
meditating, practising Zen,
begging for alms,

09:19.337 --> 09:22.873
learning to see the world in a flower,
a Bodhisattva in a leaf.

09:22.874 --> 09:26.733
Only then can we confidently know
and see that all is illusion.

09:26.734 --> 09:29.938
Life originates in your self,
appearances are created by your mind.

09:29.939 --> 09:33.027
One stupid thought undoes all wisdom.
Stop thinking about fighting and killing.

09:33.028 --> 09:36.250
- Now, you should...
- I know, chant sutras, practise Zen...

09:36.251 --> 09:39.343
Wrong! Keep begging for alms.

09:40.541 --> 09:43.376
Yes, Shifu*.

10:07.328 --> 10:09.151
The Mountain Trolls are coming!

10:09.152 --> 10:12.826
Shoot your arrows!

10:18.784 --> 10:21.846
Onward!

10:38.755 --> 10:39.971
Liuer!

10:39.972 --> 10:41.923
Liuer?

10:41.924 --> 10:43.705
Jiang Liuer!

10:43.909 --> 10:46.521
One, two, four...

10:47.204 --> 10:49.273
48, altogether.

10:50.021 --> 10:52.132
This one's too old,
get rid of him!

10:52.133 --> 10:56.774
- But boss, we're still short one baby girl.
- <i>One baby girl coming up!</i>

11:00.838 --> 11:03.066
Here's a baby girl!

11:13.449 --> 11:16.124
Liuer, what are you up to?

11:16.308 --> 11:18.749
Little kids shouldn't...

11:24.001 --> 11:26.757
- Shifu*, run!
- What's going on?

11:28.519 --> 11:31.369
- C'mon, Shifu*!
- Liuer!

11:31.370 --> 11:34.996
- What horrible mess have you
gotten us into? - This way, Shifu!

11:57.413 --> 11:58.892
Shifu*!

11:58.893 --> 12:01.506
Liuer, run!

12:01.709 --> 12:03.235
Run!

13:34.226 --> 13:37.877
- Where's the kid?
- Here!

13:41.782 --> 13:43.789
You idiot!

14:08.890 --> 14:12.829
Liuer, where are you?

14:12.830 --> 14:14.642
Liuer!

15:17.062 --> 15:18.586
Run!

18:19.108 --> 18:21.375
Where'd that beastly monkey come from?

18:21.376 --> 18:24.601
What are you staring at?
Get him!

19:12.062 --> 19:14.234
Horsey.

20:47.010 --> 20:51.343
Buddha, old boy, you trapped me
for 500 years, wasn't that enough?

20:51.375 --> 20:54.762
Don't forget. I'm the
Great Sage Equal to Heaven!

20:55.822 --> 20:57.322
The Great Sage Equal to Heaven?

20:57.871 --> 21:01.540
Who's there?
Come out and show yourself!

21:01.906 --> 21:03.596
Right now!

21:04.748 --> 21:06.348
You again?!

21:07.121 --> 21:09.701
Are you really the
Great Sage Equal to Heaven?

21:10.501 --> 21:12.260
Yeah, so?

21:13.421 --> 21:15.695
He really IS the Great Sage!

21:15.696 --> 21:17.965
Don't follow me, you little fart!

21:18.450 --> 21:20.099
Great Sage!

21:27.919 --> 21:29.519
Oh, that way...

21:31.739 --> 21:33.383
Thank you Woodland Pixie.

21:43.765 --> 21:46.761
Great Sage, wait for me!

21:53.971 --> 21:56.939
Great Sage, what are you
doing here?

22:01.686 --> 22:03.186
N-nothing.

22:09.973 --> 22:13.879
Great Sage, I just saw you
talking to Buddha's statue.

22:13.880 --> 22:15.981
Then you must've met...

22:19.709 --> 22:22.730
Let's see you follow me up here,
you little fart!

22:26.811 --> 22:28.311
Great Sage.

22:29.601 --> 22:31.603
You must have met Buddha.

22:33.787 --> 22:37.306
Do you think Buddha can hear me
when I recite sutras?

22:37.307 --> 22:39.439
Yeah, he hears you, alright!

22:39.480 --> 22:42.701
The old boy loves to poke his
nose in everyone's business.

22:43.765 --> 22:47.961
Great Sage, you must know
a lot of magic. I just know it!

22:49.112 --> 22:52.104
The Great Sage Equal to Heaven:
Sun Wukong!

22:52.105 --> 22:54.588
Body of steel and eyes of fire.

22:54.589 --> 22:57.564
Immortal shapeshifter who
mastered 72 Transformations,

22:57.565 --> 23:01.683
and can teleport himself 108,000 miles
in a single Cloud Somersault!

23:05.459 --> 23:08.434
Each hair can become
an entire clone of you.

23:08.832 --> 23:12.162
Just pluck and blow.
Hey, how come no clones?

23:12.163 --> 23:15.443
Oh right, you also have
the Gold Banded Rod.

23:15.603 --> 23:19.551
They say it weighs 13,600 pounds!

23:19.552 --> 23:22.805
Great Sage, where's your
Gold Banded Rod?

23:22.945 --> 23:25.462
In the puppet show,
you hid it in your ear.

23:26.273 --> 23:27.798
Let me see!

23:28.130 --> 23:29.152
Let me see!

23:29.153 --> 23:30.529
You stupid little fart!

23:30.530 --> 23:34.337
All this chatter along the way,
will make my brain explode!

23:34.338 --> 23:36.215
Can't you leave me in peace?

23:36.387 --> 23:37.889
Alright.

23:37.890 --> 23:40.184
No more about the Gold Banded Rod!

23:40.508 --> 23:43.896
Great Sage, does the God Erlang
really have three eyes?

23:48.731 --> 23:50.712
Cool!

23:51.075 --> 23:54.499
Great Sage, is Juling the
River God as strong as all that?

23:54.500 --> 23:55.589
Yes...

23:55.590 --> 23:57.572
Are the Four Heavenly Kings
really brothers?

23:57.573 --> 23:59.204
No, they're sisters.

23:59.205 --> 24:02.149
- Then is Nezha a boy?
- He's a girl.

24:02.150 --> 24:04.453
- Does the Pagoda Bearing God
live in his pagoda? - No!

24:04.454 --> 24:06.954
- Do other people live in it?
- Aww, no!

24:33.137 --> 24:36.880
Insolent Sun Wukong,
I am the Mountain God.

24:36.890 --> 24:40.968
Buddha left you in my custody,
how dare you go AWOL?!

24:40.969 --> 24:43.945
If you know who I am,
you should also know that when...

24:43.946 --> 24:48.128
Sun, The Great Sage, is out and about
you'd best get outta his way!

24:49.707 --> 24:53.843
Sun Wukong, the talisman's spell
still blocks your powers.

24:53.844 --> 24:56.522
You're just a common, smelly monkey,

24:56.523 --> 25:02.038
and nothing to brag about.
With one punch, I could...

25:05.802 --> 25:07.617
Halt, demon monkey!

25:57.704 --> 26:00.465
[Om Mani Padme Hum]
- The talisman!

26:24.758 --> 26:26.602
Where do you think you're going?

27:01.000 --> 27:02.769
Don't move.

27:35.192 --> 27:37.821
Great Sage, look! (The talisman)

27:50.192 --> 27:54.521
[Om mani padme hum: Sanskrit]

28:11.700 --> 28:16.668
You sure got the wrong end of the stick
from that thing in Wu Xing Mountain!

28:16.669 --> 28:20.362
Could it be that monkey
Keeper of the Heavenly Horses?

28:20.582 --> 28:25.732
My Lord, do you mean that
hairy monkey was Sun Wukong?

28:25.733 --> 28:31.034
I'll go see for myself, what
tricks he has up his sleeve.

28:51.081 --> 28:52.581
Great Sage?

28:53.538 --> 28:57.118
You're here too?
I thought I'd never see you again.

28:58.602 --> 29:02.762
Um, I put you down on the mountain,
then I remember falling off the cliff...

29:02.763 --> 29:06.432
Then a big, weird fish tried to eat us...

29:07.691 --> 29:09.547
Oh, I know!

29:09.548 --> 29:13.951
The Great Sage saved us!
The Great Sage saved us!

29:14.860 --> 29:16.360
Great Sage!

29:18.827 --> 29:22.146
Thank you for saving us.

29:33.070 --> 29:36.429
No, no! Shifu said monks
can't eat meat.

29:36.430 --> 29:37.999
You're a monk?

29:38.000 --> 29:43.598
I'm a novice, Jiang Liuer. Me and my Master,
Fa Ming, live in Chang'an City. My...

29:43.599 --> 29:46.916
What were you doing
at Wu Xing Mountain?

29:48.232 --> 29:51.891
It was those evil Mountain Trolls,
they steal little children.

29:51.892 --> 29:56.685
I ran into her by accident and
then, the Mountain Trolls chased us,

29:56.686 --> 29:59.302
that's how we ended up here.

30:00.242 --> 30:02.191
Those evil Mountain Trolls!

30:11.250 --> 30:16.488
But it's all right, now, with the
Great Sage there's nothing to fear!

30:25.109 --> 30:28.258
Did I ever say I'd protect you?

30:29.205 --> 30:33.973
Once we're off this mountain,
you go your way and I'll go mine!

30:33.974 --> 30:35.474
But, Great Sage...

30:36.950 --> 30:38.794
Careful, it's hot!

30:45.463 --> 30:46.551
Great Sage?

30:46.552 --> 30:49.164
It's fine! I'm alright.

30:52.343 --> 30:54.604
Silly girl!

31:05.589 --> 31:09.178
Great Sage, there's a temple!

31:54.654 --> 31:56.155
Great Sage!

31:59.007 --> 32:02.016
Great Sage,
the Buddha has materialized!

32:02.017 --> 32:03.517
Buddha?

32:05.469 --> 32:07.517
Om Mani Padme Hum!

32:11.393 --> 32:13.206
Om Mani Padme Hum!

32:13.923 --> 32:15.479
Om Mani Padme Hum!

32:42.149 --> 32:46.341
Put her down, demon! This is Sun Wukong,
the Great Sage Equal to Heaven!

32:46.342 --> 32:49.854
Great Sage Equal to Heaven?!
Look at that matted hair!

32:49.855 --> 32:54.299
If he's the Great Sage, then I'm
still Admiral Tianpeng of Heaven's Navy!

32:56.006 --> 32:58.651
He actually thinks he is Sun Wukong!

32:58.759 --> 33:01.958
Gimme a hand, kid, hold this.

33:01.959 --> 33:05.981
And watch me teach
this 'Great Sage' a lesson.

33:13.900 --> 33:17.341
En garde, monkey!

33:41.128 --> 33:43.072
It's really him!

33:46.190 --> 33:51.245
You stinking monkey! You're the one
who threw me down from Heaven.

33:51.246 --> 33:55.469
Left me here to starve for 500 years.
Look how skinny I've become!

33:55.470 --> 33:57.453
You'll pay for this with your life!

33:57.454 --> 34:00.642
I got your revenge right here,
come and get it.

34:06.183 --> 34:10.163
Smelly monkey, don't go yet,
I have more kungfu skills. Stop!

34:11.920 --> 34:13.572
He's gone away.

34:15.632 --> 34:19.621
I'll spare you today,
but stay outta my sight!

34:19.882 --> 34:22.460
Scared to chase him, huh?

34:22.462 --> 34:25.728
Nonsense, how can I find him
in this big old forest?

34:25.728 --> 34:27.601
He's too fast.

34:27.686 --> 34:30.780
It seems, Admiral Tianpeng isn't even
as powerful as a Woodland Pixie.

34:30.781 --> 34:32.978
What? Woodland Pixie?!

34:32.978 --> 34:35.746
I've commanded Heavenly Hosts
of tens of thousands.

34:35.748 --> 34:37.777
I can transform into 36 shapes.

34:37.779 --> 34:40.274
That smelly monkey hasn't
bathed in 500 years.

34:40.275 --> 34:44.051
I can sniff him out by his B.O.!

34:44.052 --> 34:50.185
Watch carefully, kids. I'll transform
into the Heavenly Hound and catch him!

34:53.621 --> 34:57.450
Yeah... That's the Howling
Hound of Heaven, alright.

34:57.686 --> 35:01.482
- Let's go catch the Great Sage!
- Seriously?

35:02.390 --> 35:04.586
Didn't he go the other way?

35:34.617 --> 35:37.902
The Great Sage is over there!

35:41.852 --> 35:43.291
Great Sage!

35:43.292 --> 35:45.168
Great Sage, wait!

35:45.271 --> 35:46.871
Great Sage!

35:47.003 --> 35:49.711
Admiral Tianpeng wants
to challenge you.

35:50.548 --> 35:54.097
Strange. He was just here.

35:54.601 --> 35:57.764
Great Sage, do you both
know each other?

35:57.765 --> 36:00.477
Is he really Admiral Tianpeng
of Heaven's Navy?

36:00.552 --> 36:04.881
- I kinda think he looks like a...
- A pig.

36:05.951 --> 36:08.787
He's a lot better looking now
than he used to be.

36:10.167 --> 36:13.213
But his 36 transformations
are pretty awesome!

36:13.214 --> 36:15.316
That's a piece of cake.

36:15.711 --> 36:17.876
And he can't old them for long.

36:19.839 --> 36:24.063
Uncle Pig, there you are!
I didn't think you'd dare come.

36:24.064 --> 36:27.104
You just don't let up!
Alright, let's fight!

36:33.346 --> 36:35.752
Cool! You look just like me.

36:38.115 --> 36:40.151
Only, your belly is bigger.

36:47.523 --> 36:49.976
Awesome! Shapeshift again!

36:56.581 --> 36:58.744
Great Sage, look!

37:03.077 --> 37:04.577
Get away!

37:22.822 --> 37:24.324
Stay there!

37:33.897 --> 37:35.397
Don't move!

37:36.617 --> 37:38.117
Nobody move!

37:51.434 --> 37:55.135
Great Sage, you scared him off.

37:55.136 --> 37:58.166
You were just about to be eaten!
Do you realize?

37:58.167 --> 38:00.941
Why did you provoke that white dragon?

38:07.084 --> 38:11.277
It's all your fault, you demon pig,
I should feed you to the dragon!

38:11.278 --> 38:13.301
What? It's just a dragon!

38:13.302 --> 38:16.846
Great Sage, let him go.
It was my fault.

38:16.847 --> 38:18.831
- Too late!
- Please don't!

38:18.832 --> 38:20.738
Why do you always defend him?

38:20.975 --> 38:24.035
His ear is all red!

38:32.657 --> 38:35.056
Great Sage, the dragon flew away!

38:35.057 --> 38:37.423
Monkey, let me go!
I'm getting annoyed at you!

38:37.424 --> 38:39.397
Now, you're making me mad.
Really mad!

38:52.623 --> 38:55.206
Dragons can really fly!

38:55.282 --> 38:58.071
Freedom. It's so great.

38:58.420 --> 39:00.499
It'd be great if I could fly.

39:00.500 --> 39:03.436
What's the big deal
about flying? I can fly.

39:03.437 --> 39:07.845
Then I could fly over the
mountains and find my Shifu*.

39:07.860 --> 39:11.720
And take this silly girl home.

39:12.309 --> 39:15.413
If one day you're strong enough,

39:15.414 --> 39:17.034
and brave enough,

39:18.102 --> 39:20.268
then you can accomplish all that.

39:22.198 --> 39:24.877
Great Sage, you really mean that?

39:28.503 --> 39:30.988
Great Sage!

39:31.320 --> 39:34.231
You've been to the Dragon Palace.
Is the Dragon King huge?

39:34.232 --> 39:36.875
He's big alright, but real stingy.

39:37.272 --> 39:40.631
Right. Great Sage, are there
lots of dragons in the world?

39:40.632 --> 39:42.974
Sure, wherever there's water,
there's dragons.

41:14.052 --> 41:15.971
Looks like a house up ahead.

41:15.972 --> 41:18.168
They must have food!

41:19.553 --> 41:22.565
Little Shifu*, wait for me!
(Young master)

41:27.526 --> 41:30.202
Great Sage, come on!

41:41.511 --> 41:44.763
Great Sage, hurry up!

41:45.332 --> 41:46.908
Stay here, don't move!

41:53.801 --> 41:55.485
Welcome... aahh!

41:59.081 --> 42:02.014
Pardon me, is anybody home?

42:05.163 --> 42:06.911
Anybody here?

42:13.227 --> 42:15.039
Where is everybody?

42:16.138 --> 42:17.639
Coming...

42:40.399 --> 42:41.899
Anyone here?

42:45.295 --> 42:49.710
Sir, we are travelers.
Can we spend the night here?

42:49.711 --> 42:52.068
Uh, spend... what?

42:54.736 --> 42:57.200
We're such neglectful hosts!

42:57.201 --> 42:58.383
Don't mind him.

42:58.384 --> 43:01.445
He's got a screw loose.

43:02.865 --> 43:05.616
Young Shifu*, where are you headed?

43:05.617 --> 43:07.558
We're going to Chang'an City.

43:08.081 --> 43:10.919
What an adorable baby!

43:12.498 --> 43:14.119
Go get some tea.

43:15.954 --> 43:17.798
Chang'an City, huh?

43:17.807 --> 43:20.978
Young Shifu*, you mustn't go
to Chang'an City.

43:20.979 --> 43:23.001
I heard it's under attack by Trolls.

43:31.153 --> 43:34.324
Demons! Demons!

43:34.325 --> 43:35.700
Demons!

43:35.701 --> 43:38.153
Demons! Demons!

43:38.166 --> 43:41.298
Madam, don't be afraid.
They're good people.

43:42.898 --> 43:46.001
- Good people?
- They just look a bit weird.

43:46.002 --> 43:47.990
He said you look weird!

43:47.991 --> 43:53.182
Don't worry. We'll just stay
the night and be gone by morning.

43:53.432 --> 43:55.531
- Really?
- Really!

43:56.728 --> 43:59.947
- Th-then follow me.
- Thank you, Ma'am.

44:05.100 --> 44:06.506
No problem.

44:06.507 --> 44:09.757
Hey, you hairy monkey,
stop acting like a hairy ape!

44:11.418 --> 44:15.309
We're honored to have you
as guests in our humble home.

44:15.450 --> 44:16.950
A bed!

44:22.519 --> 44:26.200
Please rest gentlemen, let me
know if you need anything.

44:31.899 --> 44:34.559
Don't stand there like an idiot,
go do something!

44:35.100 --> 44:37.308
Why's this kid constantly crying?

44:37.309 --> 44:40.081
Silly girl, don't cry.
Sleep now, hm?

44:51.422 --> 44:56.019
Look. A Great Sage doll,
just for you.

44:56.352 --> 45:00.020
With him protecting you,
there's nothing to fear.

45:16.058 --> 45:18.558
- Huh?
- Go to sleep.

45:21.633 --> 45:23.798
You waste of space!

45:45.862 --> 45:48.057
It's so quiet here.

45:48.646 --> 45:51.429
I'm used to forest sounds,

45:51.430 --> 45:54.266
and I can't sleep without them.

45:54.275 --> 45:56.580
You've only been in the forest
a few days.

45:56.581 --> 45:58.278
I'm the one who can't sleep.

45:58.279 --> 45:59.995
I guess so...

46:00.255 --> 46:03.292
Great Sage,
once I find my Shifu*

46:03.455 --> 46:07.292
and this girl gets back home,
where will you go?

46:07.711 --> 46:10.807
- Huaguo Shan*. - Huaguo Shan*?
(Flower Fruit Mountain)

46:10.808 --> 46:12.996
I know that place from
the puppet show.

46:13.609 --> 46:16.584
The story says Huaguo Shan
is an enchanted place.

46:16.585 --> 46:19.209
A whole mountain full of
fruit trees, flowers and grass.

46:19.210 --> 46:22.877
It's surrounded by hills and rivers
and it's spring all year long.

46:22.878 --> 46:26.344
Yeah, and it says the peaches
are as big as rice bowls.

46:26.345 --> 46:28.767
You believe everything
in puppet shows?

46:33.515 --> 46:36.447
Actually, they're as big
as a washbasin.

46:37.324 --> 46:39.327
A washbasin?!

46:42.124 --> 46:44.704
How far is Huaguo Shan*?

46:45.005 --> 46:48.673
- About 108,000 li*.
- I'd have to walk a lifetime.

46:49.676 --> 46:52.820
But what does the Great Sage
care about distance?

46:52.821 --> 46:56.738
That's right!
With one somersault I'd...

47:01.903 --> 47:03.403
Great Sage...

47:03.406 --> 47:07.538
once I get the little girl home,
I promise I'll chant sutras,

47:07.695 --> 47:10.403
because you said Buddha
will hear me.

47:11.375 --> 47:15.812
I'll ask him to restore
your supernatural powers.

47:19.569 --> 47:22.464
You little fart,
chattering on all the time...

47:22.465 --> 47:25.749
You're apt to annoy the old boy
with your gibberish

47:25.765 --> 47:28.149
and he'll add more time
to my sentence.

47:38.323 --> 47:40.327
Maybe one day...

48:47.515 --> 48:49.584
What are you doing here?

48:51.732 --> 48:53.743
Why are you so tense?

48:56.220 --> 48:58.673
Stealing food again, huh?

48:59.710 --> 49:01.457
Any activity upstairs?

49:04.093 --> 49:05.618
Oh, by the way...

49:08.830 --> 49:11.530
Why are you still standing
there like an idiot?

49:11.710 --> 49:13.211
Come with me!

49:23.456 --> 49:24.956
You know...

49:25.632 --> 49:27.710
I find it odd.

49:27.711 --> 49:32.757
How powerful can that monkey be?
Why all these precautions?

49:35.554 --> 49:39.637
Don't you think our lord's
being overly cautious?

49:40.130 --> 49:41.686
I'm talking to you!

49:42.714 --> 49:46.591
I think we could
take him down, right now.

49:47.907 --> 49:49.430
Where are you going?

49:51.748 --> 49:52.770
Wait!

49:52.771 --> 49:56.481
I was just thinking out loud,
you fool.

49:58.660 --> 50:01.400
If you ruin our lord's plans,
your life is over.

50:02.052 --> 50:03.608
I said, wait!

50:06.822 --> 50:09.562
Stupid pig, how dare you trick me!

50:09.990 --> 50:11.490
Help!

50:16.334 --> 50:19.994
You think you can fool the
grandaddy of all tricksters?

50:40.650 --> 50:42.150
Watch out!

51:27.054 --> 51:29.827
Young Shifu*, where do
you think you're going?

52:03.146 --> 52:04.997
Save the kids!

52:13.136 --> 52:15.413
Hey, no bum biting!

52:25.808 --> 52:27.579
RUN!

52:31.735 --> 52:33.235
GO!

52:57.179 --> 52:58.679
Let's get outta here!

53:06.871 --> 53:08.787
Where's that monkey?

53:13.339 --> 53:15.121
Great Sage, this way!

53:29.177 --> 53:30.777
To the boat!

53:40.059 --> 53:41.482
Faster!

54:28.097 --> 54:29.697
Hold her.

54:50.407 --> 54:52.059
Great Sage!

54:59.401 --> 55:01.276
Great Sage, look.

55:20.267 --> 55:22.368
Put her down.

55:28.780 --> 55:31.987
Hmph! Great Sage Equal to Heaven!

55:31.988 --> 55:34.434
He's just a useless monkey.

55:41.422 --> 55:45.762
Young Shifu*, you're quite
naughty for a monk.

55:57.072 --> 56:01.540
Sun Wukong,
this just isn't your day.

56:47.958 --> 56:49.514
Great Sage.

56:49.622 --> 56:52.650
We have to save the little girl.

56:53.593 --> 56:54.998
I can't help you.

56:54.999 --> 56:58.732
- But, Great Sage...
- I said, I can't help you!

56:58.871 --> 57:00.982
I can't be responsible for that kid.

57:00.983 --> 57:03.190
Easy, monkey.

57:03.191 --> 57:05.175
Don't call me monkey!

57:05.176 --> 57:07.724
Shut your mouth, you stupid pig!

57:11.221 --> 57:15.020
But, you're the only one
who can save her, now.

57:21.366 --> 57:23.494
I'll go save her.

57:23.495 --> 57:25.455
Young Shifu*, wait!

57:25.466 --> 57:28.879
Monkey, young Shifu* has run off.

57:28.887 --> 57:30.687
Monkey!

58:11.099 --> 58:13.576
That damned monkey!

58:16.961 --> 58:20.160
I ache all over.

58:20.161 --> 58:23.772
Hurry, or we'll miss the
Lord's sacrificial offering.

59:13.256 --> 59:18.108
<i>Great Sage, let's go save
the silly girl!</i>

59:18.345 --> 59:19.845
I...

59:20.329 --> 59:22.503
I can't help you.

59:22.504 --> 59:25.565
I can't help! I can't...

59:26.314 --> 59:28.030
<i>Great Sage!</i>

59:28.106 --> 59:29.606

59:32.101 --> 59:35.085

59:35.086 --> 59:36.959
<i>Would you like it?</i>

59:44.264 --> 59:47.975
<i>With him protecting you,
there's nothing to fear.</i>

59:48.844 --> 59:50.559
Monkey.

59:50.635 --> 59:52.136
Monkey!

59:52.172 --> 59:54.145
Are you still alive?

59:54.668 --> 59:56.673
Say something.

59:58.286 --> 01:00:00.877
I know you're feeling upset.

01:00:00.878 --> 01:00:02.378
But...

01:00:05.229 --> 01:00:09.347
Don't forget, you are the
Great Sage Equal to Heaven.

01:00:10.606 --> 01:00:13.198

"This little piggy went to market"

01:02:04.829 --> 01:02:08.240
"This little piggy stayed home"

01:02:22.111 --> 01:02:24.787
Young Shifu*, what a coincidence!

01:02:30.207 --> 01:02:32.627
Ooh... tough guy!

01:02:32.737 --> 01:02:34.613
C'mon, this side, now.

01:02:51.714 --> 01:02:53.942
Liuer, are you alright?

01:02:54.819 --> 01:02:56.866
Shifu*, how'd you get here?

01:02:56.867 --> 01:02:59.074
I went to hell and back
to find you.

01:02:59.075 --> 01:03:02.516
Let's get you out of here.
And don't run off again!

01:03:02.659 --> 01:03:05.721
I'll meditate, practise Zen,
beg for alms, I promise!

01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:09.880
Monks who try to fool Buddha
will be punished.

01:03:15.205 --> 01:03:17.593
This is our punishment!

01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:23.558
Shifu*, look!

01:03:23.559 --> 01:03:25.179
So many children!

01:03:33.607 --> 01:03:35.869
Why are you standing there
like idiots?

01:04:20.205 --> 01:04:21.705
Shifu*!

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:25.537
Silly girl!

01:04:35.855 --> 01:04:38.188
My Lord, time's running out.

01:04:39.888 --> 01:04:45.316
Sun Wukong, you keep spoiling
my plans over and over.

01:04:48.785 --> 01:04:50.661
Liuer!

01:04:53.649 --> 01:04:55.889
Where is that coward Sun Wukong?

01:04:55.890 --> 01:04:58.022
He's not a coward!

01:04:58.994 --> 01:05:00.902
Spit it out!

01:05:01.425 --> 01:05:03.015
Where is he?

01:06:08.602 --> 01:06:11.600
The Great Sage, he came!

01:06:11.703 --> 01:06:14.396
The Great Sage Equal to Heaven
is real!

01:06:18.492 --> 01:06:20.816
Damned monkey!

01:06:22.524 --> 01:06:23.867
Demon!

01:06:23.868 --> 01:06:26.556
Sun Wukong is here, you'd better...

01:06:26.557 --> 01:06:29.714
Admiral Tianpeng is here!

01:06:30.141 --> 01:06:33.137
Demon, you're in big trouble now!

01:06:37.118 --> 01:06:38.618
Pig, be careful!

01:07:09.754 --> 01:07:11.998
Huh! Glass jaw.

01:07:18.755 --> 01:07:21.112
Get away from those kids!

01:07:49.863 --> 01:07:51.363
Great Sage!

01:08:01.673 --> 01:08:03.400
Sun Wukong...

01:08:03.401 --> 01:08:07.597
How does this taste compared to
your Immortality Peaches?

01:08:11.497 --> 01:08:13.417
I said...

01:08:13.418 --> 01:08:18.750
leave them alone!

01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:04.621
Great Sage!

01:09:36.051 --> 01:09:37.959
Let me go!

01:09:47.189 --> 01:09:48.689
Great Sage!

01:09:56.374 --> 01:09:57.963
I'm fine.

01:09:58.419 --> 01:10:02.103
Let me catch my breath,
then we'll all go.

01:10:03.094 --> 01:10:06.316
Catch! Don't lose it again.

01:10:51.038 --> 01:10:53.298
Run!

01:10:59.837 --> 01:11:02.353
Hurry!

01:12:09.062 --> 01:12:12.770
- Shifu, I'll go help the Great Sage!
- Liuer!

01:12:15.624 --> 01:12:17.702
Be careful.

01:12:17.703 --> 01:12:19.203
I will!

01:12:34.746 --> 01:12:37.185
Great Sage,
what can I do to help?

01:12:37.186 --> 01:12:41.023
Who told you to come back?
What did you come for? Go away!

01:12:41.322 --> 01:12:44.447
But you promised we'd leave together.

01:12:45.771 --> 01:12:49.419
Silly boy. You forgot I'm the
Great Sage Equal To Heaven.

01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:51.072
I can't die.

01:12:51.436 --> 01:12:52.992
Great Sage!♥

01:12:57.068 --> 01:12:58.568
Great Sage!

01:12:58.733 --> 01:13:01.761
Jiang Liuer, what are you doing?

01:13:06.381 --> 01:13:08.834
- Jiang Liuer!
- Eat this!

01:13:16.911 --> 01:13:18.411
Stop!

01:13:26.801 --> 01:13:31.392
You big fat bug, here I am,
come and get me!

01:14:14.710 --> 01:14:16.459
Jiang Liuer!

01:14:22.647 --> 01:14:24.170
Jiang Liuer!

01:14:28.728 --> 01:14:31.148
You stupid kid!

01:14:31.447 --> 01:14:33.388
Jiang Liuer!

01:14:42.553 --> 01:14:44.053
Great Sage!

01:15:36.576 --> 01:15:38.516
Jiang Liuer...

01:15:39.039 --> 01:15:41.428
Jiang Liuer!

01:18:42.359 --> 01:18:44.235
Great Sage!

01:18:53.944 --> 01:18:55.444
<i>Great Sage!</i>
