02:26.913 --> 02:29.014
Christian just got back
from vegas.

02:29.016 --> 02:31.917
Yeah. It was just for
the weekend. Private thing.

02:31.919 --> 02:34.720
- He knows everyone.
- Cool.

02:34.722 --> 02:36.455
"Knows."
who "knows" anyone these days?

02:36.457 --> 02:39.358
More like you hang out
when you're in vegas.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.326
So where did you guys stay
in vegas?

02:42.795 --> 02:45.230
I like the four seasons,
the mandalay.

02:45.232 --> 02:46.431
I like the end of the strip

02:46.433 --> 02:49.034
So I can watch the planes
fly into mccarran.

02:49.036 --> 02:50.903
Well, it's good
to finally meet you, man.

02:50.905 --> 02:55.307
It's good to finally, you know,
meet the man in person.

02:55.309 --> 02:57.442
Yeah.

02:57.444 --> 02:59.411
No problem.

03:00.880 --> 03:03.048
And hey, I, um,

03:03.050 --> 03:07.019
I really want to thank you
for giving me that role.

03:07.021 --> 03:08.487
I didn't give you that role.

03:08.489 --> 03:10.189
Your girlfriend
and the director did.

03:10.191 --> 03:13.091
Yeah, but I heard I wasn't
exactly gerald's first choice.

03:13.093 --> 03:15.127
Ryan, come on.
Don't say that.

03:15.129 --> 03:17.796
No, he's right.
You weren't.

03:17.798 --> 03:20.432
But I went to him and told him
that I'm paying for this movie,

03:20.434 --> 03:22.834
So if he doesn't put my
assistant's boyfriend in it,

03:22.836 --> 03:27.072
Then I'm pullin' out, and
that's when the panic sets in.

03:27.074 --> 03:29.942
Panic.
Panic set in?

03:29.944 --> 03:32.377
I mean, it's just a low-budget
slasher movie, christian.

03:32.379 --> 03:34.513
I don't think people
were panicked by you.

03:34.515 --> 03:36.515
I think, you know, they could
have found the money somehow,

03:36.517 --> 03:38.884
But you made it easier, right?

03:40.853 --> 03:43.722
Well, I have to admit, actually
I was a little bit panicked.

03:44.991 --> 03:47.826
Fact of the matter is
I'm paying for this thing.

03:47.828 --> 03:50.596
I heard from both of you
that he was right for the part.

03:50.598 --> 03:53.165
Yeah, indirectly I had something
to do with you getting the role,

03:53.167 --> 03:55.200
But if it wasn't for you
helping out with the casting

03:55.202 --> 03:56.802
And convincing me
that this guy was,

03:56.804 --> 03:58.403
You know, the best one
for the role,

03:58.405 --> 04:02.307
Then yeah, you probably
wouldn't have the part.

04:02.309 --> 04:05.944
And we thank you
for the favor.

04:05.946 --> 04:08.347
I think we all made
the right decision.

04:11.818 --> 04:14.886
You know, in the year
that she worked for me,

04:14.888 --> 04:16.922
She never mentioned
having a boyfriend.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.523
That is not true!
I did, too!

04:18.524 --> 04:21.360
You just weren't
paying attention.

04:21.362 --> 04:22.427
Really?

04:23.863 --> 04:26.131
You guys look happy though.

04:26.133 --> 04:29.034
Yeah, we are.
Really happy.

04:29.036 --> 04:30.969
Yeah, really are.

04:35.808 --> 04:38.210
And you guys?

04:38.212 --> 04:42.347
How long have you two
been seeing each other?

04:42.349 --> 04:47.319
I told you, baby, a year.
Just like us.

04:47.321 --> 04:49.021
Yeah.

04:49.023 --> 04:50.789
I like to keep things loose,
though.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.292
I mean, I love her.

04:53.294 --> 04:55.193
God, she's gorgeous.

04:55.195 --> 04:59.398
But it's more fun to keep it
a little complicated.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.600
Complicated?

05:01.602 --> 05:04.903
Christian, what are you doing?
Where are you going with this?

05:04.905 --> 05:06.338
Just being transparent, baby.

05:06.340 --> 05:08.340
Being transparent
about what?

05:08.342 --> 05:11.176
You know that phone app, amore?

05:11.178 --> 05:13.178
It's kinda like
a girlfriend finder.

05:13.180 --> 05:15.714
Yeah... I mean no.

05:15.716 --> 05:18.150
Wh-what does it do?

05:18.152 --> 05:21.019
It makes... Things simple.

05:21.021 --> 05:24.089
Certain... Assignations.

05:24.091 --> 05:25.490
Just really easy.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.192
You know, you get live video,
make sure that people look

05:27.194 --> 05:29.561
Exactly the way they do
in their profiles.

05:29.563 --> 05:32.597
Assignations for...

05:32.599 --> 05:34.366
What is that?

05:35.435 --> 05:37.436
It means meetings, dude.

05:37.438 --> 05:40.472
Oh! Okay.
Meetings for...

05:40.474 --> 05:41.606
Hookups.

05:41.608 --> 05:45.444
You know, girls, couples,
whatever, man.

05:45.446 --> 05:47.379
Couples. Really?

05:47.381 --> 05:50.082
Yes. Couples. Really.

05:50.084 --> 05:55.120
I guess it's just, well,
I don't know, I'm...

05:55.122 --> 05:57.556
I'm just a more
conventional guy.

05:57.558 --> 06:02.094
Which is why you're with gina,
and I'm with tara.

06:02.096 --> 06:04.629
And you don't get jealous?

06:04.631 --> 06:06.565
Jealous?

06:06.567 --> 06:11.103
Yeah. If there are other
people involved, like guys.

06:11.105 --> 06:15.173
Well, it's mostly girls.
And no, I do not get jealous

06:15.175 --> 06:17.542
Watching my girl hook up
with another chick.

06:18.978 --> 06:20.979
Is this guy...
is this guy for real?

06:20.981 --> 06:23.648
Are you for real?
Is he serious?

06:23.650 --> 06:25.751
No, no, man.
I mean, I...

06:25.753 --> 06:27.986
Look, you're the man. I'm...

06:27.988 --> 06:30.756
I-I was just trying
to keep up with you.

06:30.758 --> 06:34.993
Look, man, it's all about trust,
all right?

06:34.995 --> 06:37.429
I trust her,
she trusts me.

06:37.431 --> 06:39.498
Maybe if that trust wasn't
there, I couldn't handle it.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.567
But since it is,
we have a good time.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.536
Christian,
I'm sitting right here.

06:44.538 --> 06:46.605
What do you mean,
you couldn't handle it?

06:46.607 --> 06:49.074
Couldn't handle what?

06:49.076 --> 06:53.178
The fact that I know you love me
makes me trust you.

06:53.180 --> 06:56.915
That makes everything we do
more intense.

06:58.284 --> 07:00.318
I'm sorry. Christian likes
to shock people.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.620
I get it.

07:01.622 --> 07:02.854
Or at least he tries to.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.589
This has nothing to do
with shocking people.

07:04.591 --> 07:08.360
I'm just sick of the old school
shit about fucking propriety,

07:08.362 --> 07:09.561
Etiquette and all that crap.

07:09.563 --> 07:11.296
You've been around me
for a year.

07:11.298 --> 07:12.764
It's just fuckin' annoying.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.466
It's like when you're at
your family dinner on Sunday,

07:14.468 --> 07:16.134
- And everyone's just lying...
- christian, I want to go.

07:16.136 --> 07:17.969
- Can you get the fucking check?
- I've ordered the check.

07:17.971 --> 07:18.970
It's comin'.
It's on its way.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.272
Really?
How long does it take?

07:20.274 --> 07:22.741
Mm. It's coming though.
Don't worry about it.

07:22.743 --> 07:23.942
Oh, christian,
before I forget,

07:23.944 --> 07:25.811
I'm finalizing all the rooms
for next month.

07:25.813 --> 07:28.547
Are you definitely sure
that you're not gonna come?

07:28.549 --> 07:30.348
Yeah, there's no way
I'm going to new mexico

07:30.350 --> 07:32.284
And watch a bunch of kids
get tortured and killed

07:32.286 --> 07:35.854
By some pissed-off ghost
in a warehouse.

07:35.856 --> 07:39.391
Besides, I'll be busy
making my own little movies.

07:39.393 --> 07:41.526
What do you mean,
you make your own movies?

07:43.396 --> 07:45.063
On this, dude.

08:17.063 --> 08:23.468
<i>♪ You get no more sympathy</i>

08:23.470 --> 08:27.439
<i>♪ don't tell me</i>
<i>where you've been ♪</i>

08:27.441 --> 08:31.476
<i>♪ don't need to know</i>
<i>your sins ♪</i>

08:34.380 --> 08:37.115
Why in the hell did we have
to go to that damn dinner?

08:37.116 --> 08:38.783
Gina insisted.

08:38.784 --> 08:42.687
Plus I was kinda interested
to see who her new dude is.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.990
What a fuckin' moron.
Gina's a smart girl.

08:44.992 --> 08:46.391
You'd think she could
get with someone better

08:46.393 --> 08:47.792
Than some loser actor.

08:50.229 --> 08:53.131
What do you know about him?

08:53.133 --> 08:55.133
Nothing.

08:55.135 --> 08:58.203
I never even thought
this movie would get made.

09:00.106 --> 09:03.808
Well, gina worked very hard
to make sure it happened.

09:03.810 --> 09:05.944
I never even read the script.

09:05.946 --> 09:08.179
I told gina if the mexicans or
whoever came up with the cash

09:08.181 --> 09:10.448
That I would just match it.

09:10.450 --> 09:12.784
Why aren't you involved
anymore, baby?

09:12.786 --> 09:14.586
Why were you ever involved?

09:14.588 --> 09:17.522
My father was on my ass about
doing something with my life.

09:17.524 --> 09:21.092
When I told him I was doing
a movie, he got off my back.

09:21.094 --> 09:25.263
Why are you wearing a robe?
Guy's almost over here.

09:29.902 --> 09:32.270
What's with all the dudes
lately?

09:32.272 --> 09:34.472
I don't know.
It's a phase.

09:34.474 --> 09:36.508
I like the idea of someone
looking at something

09:36.510 --> 09:38.243
They can't have.

09:38.245 --> 09:40.845
Guy thing.
Power and control.

09:40.847 --> 09:43.615
But sometimes they do have me.

09:43.617 --> 09:46.785
Just those two times.
You didn't seem to mind.

09:49.555 --> 09:51.656
I can't believe you
at dinner tonight.

09:51.658 --> 09:54.125
All that shit that you
were telling them.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.928
Is that why you're being
so distant and bitchy, huh?

09:56.930 --> 09:59.130
Why do you even fucking care?

09:59.132 --> 10:01.566
It's just my assistant
and some dumb actor.

10:01.568 --> 10:03.335
I don't know.
I guess I'd like to keep

10:03.337 --> 10:05.403
Some parts of my life private.

10:05.405 --> 10:08.940
Some aspects of
my fucking life private.

10:08.942 --> 10:12.277
Nobody has a private life
anymore, tara.

10:12.279 --> 10:16.014
Okay. What do you talk
to your shrink about?

10:18.751 --> 10:22.420
What do you talk about
when you see dr. Campbell?

10:22.422 --> 10:24.222
I don't tell
dr. Campbell anything

10:24.224 --> 10:26.725
That I wouldn't tell you.

10:26.727 --> 10:29.461
That's a lie. That's not true.
You just lied to me.

10:29.463 --> 10:31.997
What would you like to know?

10:31.999 --> 10:34.399
I want to know what you
talk to dr. Campbell about.

10:34.401 --> 10:35.934
I talk about my family.

10:35.936 --> 10:38.103
I talk about my father trying
to control my fucking life.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.738
What the fuck do you think
I talk to him about?

10:39.740 --> 10:44.175
I don't know.
Other girls.

10:45.578 --> 10:49.781
I'm more serious about you than
I have been with any other girl.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.886
Hope you feel
the same way about me.

10:56.122 --> 10:59.758
Christian, there's
a fucking guy coming over.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.459
Really?

11:06.298 --> 11:10.235
He's here.
On his way down the driveway.

11:10.237 --> 11:14.239
And I said I hope you
feel the same way about me.

11:19.111 --> 11:22.547
What was with you tonight, hmm?
At dinner.

11:25.518 --> 11:28.453
You were so tense. Hmm?

11:37.329 --> 11:39.330
You let him in.

11:49.942 --> 11:52.177
Hi. Reed, right?

11:52.179 --> 11:54.012
Come on in.

11:57.616 --> 11:59.350
I'm tara.

12:03.289 --> 12:04.556
This is reed.

12:04.558 --> 12:07.025
What's up, man?
I'm christian.

12:07.027 --> 12:08.493
Hey, man.

12:08.495 --> 12:10.195
I see you've met tara.

12:10.197 --> 12:11.996
Yeah.

12:11.998 --> 12:14.999
You want something to drink?
Shot of tequila.

12:15.001 --> 12:16.367
Sure.

12:54.039 --> 12:55.874
She's hot, right?

13:00.179 --> 13:02.714
Way hotter than
the pics you sent me.

13:05.284 --> 13:06.885
Have a drink.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.453
Relax.

13:13.726 --> 13:15.560
Be comfy, man.

13:44.924 --> 13:48.092
You wanna see something
better than that.

14:18.457 --> 14:20.291
How does he have
all that money again?

14:20.293 --> 14:21.759
Uh, trust fund.

14:21.761 --> 14:24.929
His grandparents own like
half of thousand oaks.

14:27.499 --> 14:29.934
She's beautiful, tara,
don't you think?

14:31.537 --> 14:33.238
She's okay.

14:36.075 --> 14:38.710
Don't go there, babe.
I'm not doing that with you.

14:38.712 --> 14:41.312
Doing what?

14:41.314 --> 14:45.350
That whole "is that girl
prettier than me?" thing you do.

14:45.352 --> 14:48.987
I mean, why are you
asking me that?

14:48.989 --> 14:50.622
Look, you never even
mentioned her.

14:50.624 --> 14:52.023
You never told me about her
for a year.

14:52.025 --> 14:53.892
You didn't even mention her
by name.

14:53.894 --> 14:56.861
It was just
"christian's girlfriend."

14:59.598 --> 15:02.300
And you really didn't tell me
what a douchebag that guy is.

15:02.302 --> 15:03.701
Christ!

15:03.703 --> 15:07.272
The reason I never mentioned her
is that we never really hung out

15:07.274 --> 15:10.041
Until she started
helping me with the movie.

15:10.043 --> 15:12.043
Why was she even
helping you out?

15:12.045 --> 15:13.678
She was bored.

15:13.680 --> 15:16.848
She needed something to do
besides shopping and fucking.

15:16.850 --> 15:19.484
I mean, jon and I
did most of the work,

15:19.486 --> 15:22.253
But she helped out a little,
I guess.

15:26.225 --> 15:28.226
She did push you
for the part.

15:28.228 --> 15:30.662
I know it was probably a favor
to me and christian,

15:30.664 --> 15:32.864
But without her, I don't know
what would've happened.

15:32.866 --> 15:35.667
And then after casting,
she just disappeared.

15:35.669 --> 15:38.036
She just stopped coming by
the production office.

15:39.305 --> 15:42.106
I haven't seen her
in like a month.

16:45.104 --> 16:47.305
Hey.

16:47.307 --> 16:48.606
Thanks.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.608
I told you not to text me.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.110
Why can't I text you?

16:52.112 --> 16:55.113
Because he looks
at my phone.

16:55.115 --> 16:57.215
Why can't we meet
at my place?

16:57.217 --> 16:59.550
That's not gonna happen
anymore.

17:02.287 --> 17:05.522
So that's who you're with.
Jesus.

17:05.525 --> 17:06.723
Who'd you think you were...

17:06.726 --> 17:08.459
So this is the guy
that gave you the mercedes

17:08.461 --> 17:10.261
And has a private jet
and takes you to maui

17:10.262 --> 17:12.730
And lives in the fucking
mansion in malibu.

17:12.732 --> 17:14.031
Ryan, please.

17:14.034 --> 17:15.900
Last night killed me.

17:15.902 --> 17:17.969
Why?

17:17.971 --> 17:21.772
Because I finally saw you
with him.

17:21.775 --> 17:23.974
I know you better
than he does.

17:23.977 --> 17:26.044
You're not happy, tara.

17:26.046 --> 17:29.047
Who said anything
about happy?

17:29.049 --> 17:31.849
He takes care of me,
and he's in love with me.

17:31.851 --> 17:33.251
It's serious.

17:33.253 --> 17:35.553
Fuck it, ryan. Who's happy?
Who's really happy?

17:35.555 --> 17:36.721
- Tell me.
- Gina.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.790
- Oh, of course.
- Gina is. Gina's happy.

17:38.792 --> 17:40.825
Right, another reason why I
couldn't stand being around her.

17:40.827 --> 17:43.694
And... you really do
all that shit?

17:43.696 --> 17:46.264
Couples?
Random guys fucking you?

17:46.266 --> 17:48.332
- Jesus, tara.
- Ryan, stop.

17:48.334 --> 17:49.867
This isn't
going anywhere, okay?

17:49.869 --> 17:52.136
So there's no point
in having this discussion.

17:52.138 --> 17:54.305
This has to end.
We can't do this anymore.

17:54.307 --> 17:55.573
Why are you asking me
all this now?

17:55.575 --> 17:58.309
Because I hadn't met him before,
and I do care.

17:58.311 --> 18:02.113
I think about you all the time.
I can't help it.

18:02.115 --> 18:04.182
And it makes me sick.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.184
Can't get the things he
makes you do out of my mind.

18:06.186 --> 18:07.785
- Ryan...
- how do you think I felt

18:07.787 --> 18:09.687
Watching him flashing pictures
on his fucking phone

18:09.689 --> 18:10.922
In front of me?

18:10.924 --> 18:16.127
Last night made me sick.
It made me fuckin' sick.

18:16.129 --> 18:17.995
We can't do this anymore.
This has gotta end.

18:17.997 --> 18:19.997
What's gotta end, hmm?
What?

18:19.999 --> 18:21.666
Fucking me
for the last four weeks?

18:21.668 --> 18:22.667
You wanna end that?

18:22.669 --> 18:25.103
Stop, ryan.

18:25.105 --> 18:28.005
You ever tell him about me?
Did you ever tell him

18:28.007 --> 18:29.941
That you fell in love with me
three years ago?

18:29.943 --> 18:31.142
That you dumped me
when you realized

18:31.144 --> 18:32.310
I was the guy
who might not make it,

18:32.312 --> 18:33.845
That you essentially
abandoned me

18:33.847 --> 18:35.379
For a bunch
of rich douchebags?

18:35.381 --> 18:36.848
- And now that asshole?
- Ryan!

18:36.850 --> 18:39.050
Who are you, ryan?
You're still bartending.

18:39.052 --> 18:40.985
You're still working for randall
as a part-time assistant

18:40.987 --> 18:42.520
At a fucking hotel.

18:42.522 --> 18:44.655
This dumb little movie's not
going to do anything for you.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.891
- Then why push me for it?
- Oh, I don't know.

18:46.893 --> 18:51.229
Because I care about you
and knew how much you wanted it?

18:51.231 --> 18:54.232
See, that's what
I'm saying, baby.

18:54.234 --> 18:57.235
I loved you so much, baby.
We had so much fun together.

18:57.237 --> 18:59.871
I never got over it
when you left.

18:59.873 --> 19:02.073
It killed me, and I tried
so hard to let it go.

19:02.075 --> 19:04.142
I tried so hard
to let go of it.

19:04.144 --> 19:06.711
And just when I think I'm
gonna make it without you,

19:06.713 --> 19:09.780
Gina suddenly started talking
about her boss's girlfriend.

19:09.782 --> 19:12.650
But this girl she described
didn't sound anything like you.

19:12.652 --> 19:18.022
And then when I saw you
at that audition...

19:18.024 --> 19:20.958
I'm still
so in love with you.

19:20.960 --> 19:24.262
I don't fuckin' want to be,
but I am.

19:26.565 --> 19:29.500
I'm with him now.
I'm with him.

19:29.502 --> 19:30.968
What are you thinking?

19:30.970 --> 19:32.637
You think you're gonna nail
this guy, move in with him?

19:32.639 --> 19:34.238
You think that creep's
gonna marry you?

19:34.240 --> 19:35.940
Ryan, don't go there.

19:35.942 --> 19:38.676
It's hard for me, too, okay?
It's hard for me, too.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.646
That's why I tried helping you
with the movie 'cause I care.

19:41.648 --> 19:43.915
But you don't have to go and say
things that are gonna hurt me.

19:43.917 --> 19:46.617
- Leave him. Get out of there.
- And do what?

19:46.619 --> 19:48.486
I don't know. Come back to me.
We'll get a job.

19:48.488 --> 19:51.923
- We'll move in together.
- Get a job and do what, ryan?

19:51.925 --> 19:55.159
Do you not remember how hard
we were busting our asses?

19:55.161 --> 19:56.627
Do you remember those days?

19:56.629 --> 19:59.497
No, wait. Probably not because
you're still living them.

19:59.499 --> 20:01.933
I'm not going back
to that, ryan.

20:01.935 --> 20:03.668
I'm not going back
to going on auditions

20:03.670 --> 20:05.169
For jobs I'm never gonna get.

20:05.171 --> 20:07.638
For bartending
for 8 bucks a fucking hour.

20:07.640 --> 20:10.007
I'm not gonna do it.

20:10.009 --> 20:11.876
Do you remember
how hard it was for us?

20:11.878 --> 20:14.045
We were always fucking broke.
We were busting our asses.

20:14.047 --> 20:15.880
We couldn't even pay
the fucking rent, ryan.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.782
We couldn't pay
the fucking rent.

20:17.784 --> 20:20.518
That wasn't fun for me.
I'm not going back to that.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.186
And I need someone
to take care of me.

20:22.188 --> 20:24.422
And I needed someone
to take care of me.

21:25.217 --> 21:27.151
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.257
Want me to get you
something to drink?

21:33.259 --> 21:36.060
Yes. Water.

21:53.645 --> 21:56.580
Oh. How was your day?

21:56.582 --> 21:58.349
It was fine.

22:09.194 --> 22:11.629
Why don't you tell me
about your day instead?

22:11.631 --> 22:16.367
Okay. I got up, and I taught
two yoga sessions this morning,

22:16.369 --> 22:17.768
And then, oh, I went
to that audition,

22:17.770 --> 22:19.470
You know, the one that
I told you about last time.

22:19.472 --> 22:20.971
It was awful.

22:20.973 --> 22:23.841
I definitely didn't get the job,
but whatever.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.176
Oh, my god,
and then sheely called me,

22:25.178 --> 22:28.012
And she started telling me
all about this guy.

23:15.861 --> 23:18.162
- Goddamn it!
- What?

23:18.164 --> 23:19.730
What's wrong?

23:19.732 --> 23:22.433
Why the fuck
did you do that? Why?

23:22.435 --> 23:24.769
I just get into it
with you, okay?

23:24.771 --> 23:27.738
I'm sorry.
I can't help it.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.073
Look...

23:32.210 --> 23:35.846
This... Is just this.

23:35.848 --> 23:38.082
What does that mean?

23:42.087 --> 23:45.156
I think you're hot.

23:45.158 --> 23:47.124
I have fun.

23:47.126 --> 23:50.060
But it's not changing
my situation.

23:59.671 --> 24:02.807
Okay, what's really
going on here?

24:07.512 --> 24:08.979
I think tara's
seeing somebody.

24:08.981 --> 24:10.514
Oh, jesus.

24:10.516 --> 24:13.784
Christian, what does that
even mean, okay?

24:13.786 --> 24:16.420
Considering what you guys do.

24:16.422 --> 24:17.721
I mean, do you even care?

24:17.723 --> 24:21.058
Yes, I care.
I care a lot.

24:21.060 --> 24:24.028
What, you think
she's cheating on you?

24:27.332 --> 24:30.334
She was acting really, really
strange at dinner last night.

24:30.336 --> 24:32.803
I couldn't figure out why.

24:32.805 --> 24:36.273
And then today she met some guy
in the morning for coffee.

24:36.275 --> 24:39.376
- It's just, she...
- okay.

24:39.378 --> 24:41.445
I mean, how do you know
that she met someone?

24:41.447 --> 24:44.181
- What, did she tell you?
- No.

24:45.884 --> 24:48.752
Okay, did...
what, did the guy tell you?

24:51.022 --> 24:52.690
No.

25:02.567 --> 25:03.767
Um...

25:03.769 --> 25:06.203
I've got some stuff
I have to do today.

25:06.205 --> 25:08.372
I think you better leave.

25:15.146 --> 25:18.215
And I don't think
you should come back here.

25:22.587 --> 25:24.655
And why's that?

25:30.662 --> 25:32.997
I can't handle this anymore.

25:45.210 --> 25:46.944
Need some cash?

25:48.013 --> 25:50.681
No. Christian,
I don't need any cash.

25:50.683 --> 25:53.017
Just... just get out.

25:59.457 --> 26:00.524
Come on, cynthia.

26:00.526 --> 26:03.160
Get the fuck out.

26:10.135 --> 26:12.636
Get the fuck out of here!

26:19.110 --> 26:21.145
I'm really sorry that
I didn't congratulate you

26:21.147 --> 26:23.380
On starting
your own pr company.

26:23.382 --> 26:25.616
I mean, that must be
really exciting.

26:25.618 --> 26:27.885
Don't congratulate me just yet.
It hasn't really taken off.

26:27.887 --> 26:30.521
But you know,
if it wasn't for christian

26:30.523 --> 26:33.223
I'd never have been able
to start it.

26:33.225 --> 26:36.827
Yeah. Christian can be
very helpful that way.

26:40.432 --> 26:44.668
So dinner was fun
last night.

26:44.670 --> 26:48.706
I'm sorry if I, you know,
seemed out of it and such.

26:48.708 --> 26:50.908
I was just really
preoccupied with things.

26:50.910 --> 26:52.309
I know how christian gets.

26:52.311 --> 26:57.615
And I have to say that ryan
was a little shocked by him.

26:57.617 --> 26:59.850
But he really liked him.
He thought he was a great guy.

26:59.852 --> 27:01.285
Oh, really? He did?

27:01.287 --> 27:03.554
Yeah.
Thought he was really cool.

27:03.556 --> 27:05.756
You know, good guys are really
hard to come by these days,

27:05.758 --> 27:08.025
- So you're a very lucky girl.
- Tell me about it.

27:08.027 --> 27:11.395
I can't believe I actually
found someone so genuine.

27:11.397 --> 27:12.796
He's a great guy.

27:12.798 --> 27:15.232
Look, this was nice.

27:15.234 --> 27:17.901
I just, um...

27:17.903 --> 27:19.970
I'm sorry. I just wanted
to know something.

27:19.972 --> 27:22.172
What?

27:22.174 --> 27:24.174
Why are you off the movie?

27:24.176 --> 27:26.043
I mean, you're not coming
to new mexico, right?

27:26.045 --> 27:29.113
Oh, no. Yeah, I can't.
No, I can't do that.

27:29.115 --> 27:31.849
I'm just curious because
I'm finalizing everything,

27:31.851 --> 27:36.220
And, I don't know, you just
seemed so into it a month ago.

27:36.222 --> 27:38.288
Yeah, I mean...

27:40.725 --> 27:42.860
Okay, tell me something.

27:42.862 --> 27:45.262
Do you really like movies?

27:45.264 --> 27:46.630
Yeah!

27:46.632 --> 27:49.600
- Really, really like movies?
- Of course!

27:49.602 --> 27:52.202
When's the last time you went
to see a movie in the theater?

27:52.204 --> 27:55.806
A movie that you really thought
meant something to you?

27:55.808 --> 27:57.675
We went to the premiere
last week...

27:57.677 --> 28:00.444
Not premieres.
Premieres don't really count.

28:00.446 --> 28:01.679
I don't know, you know.

28:01.681 --> 28:04.715
I guess maybe it's just
not my thing anymore.

28:04.717 --> 28:06.784
And plus I don't wanna be
away from christian

28:06.786 --> 28:07.851
For that long, I guess.

28:07.853 --> 28:09.553
I get it.
I totally get it.

28:09.555 --> 28:12.589
I wouldn't want to be away
from ryan for that long either.

28:12.591 --> 28:15.626
No, it's just,
at the time I was bored,

28:15.628 --> 28:17.361
And I needed
something to do.

28:17.363 --> 28:20.464
And so that's why
I got involved, and...

28:20.466 --> 28:23.801
You know, now I'm looking for
something else to do, so...

28:32.410 --> 28:34.178
Are you okay?

28:34.180 --> 28:35.879
Yeah, I'm just...

28:35.881 --> 28:37.614
I just have
a lot of stuff going.

28:37.616 --> 28:40.184
I'm so preoccupied and...

28:40.186 --> 28:43.187
Look, I really have to go.

28:47.125 --> 28:49.093
Wait! Stop.
It's on me.

28:49.095 --> 28:50.828
I can bill it
to the production.

28:50.830 --> 28:52.596
Seriously.
Tara, it's okay.

28:52.598 --> 28:54.431
Thank you.

28:54.433 --> 28:57.134
Good seeing you, gina.
Um, we'll talk soon.

28:57.136 --> 28:58.902
Bye.

28:58.904 --> 29:00.571
Bye, tara.

29:15.221 --> 29:16.487
<i>Yo.</i>

29:16.489 --> 29:18.555
- So I just had lunch with her.
- <i>Yeah, and?</i>

29:18.557 --> 29:20.224
- Nothing.
- <i>Nothing.</i>

29:20.226 --> 29:21.959
Nope. Nothing.

29:21.961 --> 29:24.161
She said really nice things
about you.

29:24.163 --> 29:29.366
I mean, she seemed
a little tense, but nothing.

29:29.368 --> 29:33.137
She's not coming to new mexico
because she said she'd miss you.

29:33.139 --> 29:34.404
- Really?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

29:34.406 --> 29:35.773
<i>Christian,</i>
<i>I'm just wondering.</i>

29:35.775 --> 29:38.041
<i>What did you think</i>
<i>she was gonna say to me?</i>

29:38.043 --> 29:39.510
Nothing, babe.
I just want the chance

29:39.512 --> 29:41.145
For the two of you
to reconnect.

29:41.147 --> 29:42.813
I gotta go.
I'll talk to you later.

29:42.815 --> 29:44.782
<i>Uh, okay.</i>
<i>I'll be at the office.</i>

29:44.784 --> 29:46.984
All right, babe.
See you there.

29:49.487 --> 29:51.722
Oh, very good. Sexy.

29:53.258 --> 29:55.225
Yeah. Keep it.
Ha ha.

29:55.227 --> 29:56.693
Pick up your chin.

29:56.695 --> 29:58.929
Yes, very good. Smile.

29:58.931 --> 30:01.365
Muscle up. Come on.
Give me some attitude.

30:01.367 --> 30:03.267
That's good. Profile.

30:03.269 --> 30:05.402
Lower the chin.
Very good.

30:05.404 --> 30:08.839
Billy, switch the lights.

30:09.974 --> 30:11.074
He's pretty cute.

30:11.076 --> 30:13.143
Not again, doll.
It's not gonna work.

30:13.145 --> 30:15.546
Ryan, on your mark.

30:15.548 --> 30:17.648
Hey, ryan.
That's your name, right?

30:17.650 --> 30:19.716
Right. Get on the mark.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.154
Good. Keep it right there.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.689
Okay.

30:27.725 --> 30:29.793
Yeah, a month. Yeah.

30:29.795 --> 30:31.495
But zander said he would find
someone to take my place

30:31.497 --> 30:33.463
Just until I got back.

30:33.465 --> 30:36.600
No, jeff, zander said it was
cool if he gave me his shifts.

30:36.602 --> 30:39.203
Jeff!

30:39.205 --> 30:43.407
Jeff, come on, man.
I just really need the cash.

30:43.409 --> 30:46.043
If you're gonna make me beg,
then fuck it.

30:46.045 --> 30:48.712
I'll see you later. Bye.

30:57.222 --> 30:58.889
- I'm gonna head on up.
- All right.

30:58.891 --> 31:00.524
Thanks, man.

31:34.359 --> 31:36.493
We're also handling
the leo event,

31:36.495 --> 31:38.495
The green global thing?

31:40.231 --> 31:42.966
Listen, I gotta go.
Ryan's here.

31:42.968 --> 31:44.568
I know it isn't.

31:44.570 --> 31:47.638
Yeah, I think we're all
about to find out why.

31:49.541 --> 31:51.174
Later.

31:52.677 --> 31:55.379
Ah! Even on his day off,

31:55.381 --> 31:58.949
It is always a pleasure
to see my favorite assistant.

31:58.951 --> 32:01.251
Thanks, randall, for the first
and only compliment

32:01.253 --> 32:02.753
I'm going to receive today.

32:02.755 --> 32:05.589
Oh, I'm sorry.
What's wrong?

32:05.591 --> 32:07.157
I-I was just, uh...

32:07.159 --> 32:08.859
I was just trying to get
extra shifts at the bar,

32:08.861 --> 32:09.993
But jeff's being a prick.

32:09.995 --> 32:11.795
Well, what can I do
to help?

32:11.797 --> 32:13.931
Well, I was wondering
if there was anything else

32:13.933 --> 32:16.233
I could do around here.

32:16.235 --> 32:19.536
You know, when I offered you
this job, it was full-time.

32:19.538 --> 32:21.004
I know, I know.

32:21.006 --> 32:24.274
But I let you make it part-time
because you wanted it that way.

32:24.276 --> 32:26.877
Randall, I'm going
to new mexico for a month.

32:26.879 --> 32:29.680
They're barely paying me
anything to do this movie.

32:29.682 --> 32:31.214
I really need the cash.

32:31.216 --> 32:32.416
Can I ask you something?

32:32.418 --> 32:34.451
Have you ever considered...
I don't know.

32:34.453 --> 32:38.522
Making plans
for a sustainable future?

32:38.524 --> 32:39.723
Hmm?

32:42.961 --> 32:45.429
What am I
gonna do with you?

32:48.701 --> 32:50.934
You've been really cool,
randall.

32:50.936 --> 32:52.336
I really, you know...

32:52.338 --> 32:54.237
You know how much I appreciate
what you've done for me.

32:54.239 --> 32:56.239
You know you'll have
this job waiting for you

32:56.241 --> 32:57.374
When you get back.

32:57.376 --> 32:59.042
You know that, right?

32:59.044 --> 33:01.345
You'll have this, at least.

33:02.413 --> 33:04.514
I'm so strapped.

33:15.927 --> 33:18.295
What is it?

33:18.297 --> 33:21.865
Oh, man, I totally forgot
I have this appointment.

33:21.867 --> 33:23.300
Yeah, of course you did.

33:23.302 --> 33:25.836
Well, I will see you
tomorrow, ryan.

33:25.838 --> 33:27.838
And I'll see
what I can find for you.

33:27.840 --> 33:30.474
- Thanks, randall.
- Uh-huh.

35:23.354 --> 35:25.322
Shh. Don't worry, baby.

35:25.324 --> 35:27.124
Gonna be all right.

35:29.060 --> 35:30.494
Gonna be okay.

36:45.603 --> 36:46.970
- He in?
- Hey. Yeah.

36:46.972 --> 36:48.872
- Let me just tell him...
- keep an eye on that for me.

36:48.874 --> 36:50.073
Oh...

36:51.609 --> 36:52.876
Hey, christian.

36:52.878 --> 36:54.678
No girls allowed.

36:56.214 --> 36:58.081
Hey, christian.

36:58.083 --> 36:59.649
What's that?

36:59.651 --> 37:03.253
Going over effects
the budget will allow.

37:03.255 --> 37:05.522
Even though my boyfriend
is the effects supervisor,

37:05.524 --> 37:08.792
He's not doing this for free,
so we have to pick and choose.

37:08.794 --> 37:11.828
That little bitch.

37:13.864 --> 37:15.632
I wanna talk to you
about something.

37:15.634 --> 37:17.100
Yep?

37:18.903 --> 37:20.070
What is it?

37:20.072 --> 37:22.606
Ryan.

37:27.713 --> 37:29.713
Ryan.

37:29.715 --> 37:32.849
Another topic my boyfriend
loves to hate.

37:32.851 --> 37:34.117
Really? Why's that?

37:34.119 --> 37:35.619
Every movie I've produced,

37:35.621 --> 37:37.621
He thinks I'm trying
to bang the leading man,

37:37.623 --> 37:41.958
And, uh, half the time,
he's been wrong.

37:44.061 --> 37:46.263
I want you to call ryan in
tomorrow.

37:46.265 --> 37:48.565
Tell him he's been replaced.

37:48.567 --> 37:50.500
What? Why?

37:50.502 --> 37:53.003
What happened?
What's gerald's problem?

37:53.005 --> 37:54.304
This has nothing
to do with gerald,

37:54.306 --> 37:56.473
And ryan's not actually
being replaced.

37:56.475 --> 37:58.141
I don't get it.

37:58.143 --> 37:59.609
Just call ryan in
and tell him

37:59.611 --> 38:01.411
That gerald's thinking of
taking him out of the movie.

38:01.413 --> 38:04.547
And you, jon,
can convince him otherwise

38:04.549 --> 38:08.084
If ryan's willing
to do something for you.

38:08.086 --> 38:10.353
Like what?

38:10.355 --> 38:13.089
Tell him he gets to keep
the part if he sleeps with you.

38:21.198 --> 38:23.633
Why the hell
would I do that?

38:23.635 --> 38:24.901
Favor to me.

38:24.903 --> 38:26.736
You're not joking, huh?

38:26.738 --> 38:28.772
No, I am not.

38:28.774 --> 38:30.674
Christian,
I'm friends with gina.

38:30.676 --> 38:33.243
Ryan is totally straight.

38:33.245 --> 38:34.377
Really?

38:34.379 --> 38:37.047
You think
he's totally straight?

38:37.049 --> 38:39.082
That's what I believe, yeah.

38:39.084 --> 38:41.484
So how did he get the job
at the hotel, huh?

38:41.486 --> 38:45.689
'Cause he's so straight
or 'cause he's so, um, smart?

38:45.691 --> 38:47.791
Christian, I'm best friends
with gina,

38:47.793 --> 38:49.693
And I can't do this to her.

38:49.695 --> 38:52.729
Jon, jon, jon.

38:52.731 --> 38:54.631
Relax.

38:54.633 --> 38:56.599
It's just a prank.

38:56.601 --> 38:59.069
Test ryan,
see what his reaction is.

38:59.071 --> 39:01.104
Afterwards, you can tell him
it's a joke.

39:01.106 --> 39:02.772
And if he has the balls
to go to gina

39:02.774 --> 39:04.741
And tell her about
your little prank,

39:04.743 --> 39:06.643
Then just say,
"christian put me up to it."

39:06.645 --> 39:08.912
Blame it on me.
I'll take full responsibility.

39:08.914 --> 39:11.081
Chris, I don't think
I can do this.

39:12.650 --> 39:15.819
Jon, there are a lot
of people in this town

39:15.821 --> 39:17.187
Who call themselves
producers.

39:19.056 --> 39:21.791
You're just one.

39:26.731 --> 39:28.565
Okay.

39:28.567 --> 39:30.333
Okay.

39:30.335 --> 39:32.335
But I still don't get it.

39:32.337 --> 39:33.970
You don't need to.

39:33.972 --> 39:36.206
Besides, you might get lucky.

40:14.745 --> 40:16.212
Hey, tara!

40:17.782 --> 40:19.215

40:48.512 --> 40:51.014
Hi.

40:51.016 --> 40:53.283
What'd you do today?

40:53.285 --> 40:56.286
- I went to the gym.
- Which gym?

40:56.288 --> 40:59.289
Equinox.
The gym that I'm a member of.

40:59.291 --> 41:01.624
The one on westwood
or the one on sunset?

41:01.626 --> 41:03.460
The one in west hollywood.

41:03.462 --> 41:05.161
Why'd you go to the one
in west hollywood?

41:05.163 --> 41:08.264
Because it was closer to where
I was meeting gina for lunch.

41:08.266 --> 41:11.334
What time did you
go to the gym?

41:13.904 --> 41:16.940
Tell me something,
do you find gina attractive?

41:16.942 --> 41:20.076
No. I'd never hire an assistant
I find attractive.

41:20.078 --> 41:21.744
Why not?
She's a pretty girl.

41:21.746 --> 41:23.213
Do you find ryan attractive?

41:23.215 --> 41:24.714
Okay, here we go.

41:24.716 --> 41:27.417
No, I don't.

41:27.419 --> 41:30.086
Well, I figured you have to find
him attractive on some level.

41:30.088 --> 41:31.521
You cast him as the lead
in the movie.

41:31.523 --> 41:33.723
No, no, that's not true.

41:33.725 --> 41:35.358
I did not cast him
in the movie.

41:35.360 --> 41:38.194
All right, you made me cast him
as the lead in the movie.

41:38.196 --> 41:40.163
No, we've been over this.
I didn't make you do anything.

41:40.165 --> 41:41.898
You hired him
as a favor to gina,

41:41.900 --> 41:43.967
And that's why
he's in the movie, isn't it?

41:43.969 --> 41:45.602
Would you fuck him?

41:45.604 --> 41:47.470
What did you just
fucking ask me?

41:47.472 --> 41:53.042
I said
would... You... Fuck... Him?

41:54.846 --> 41:58.047
No... I... Wouldn't.

42:01.452 --> 42:04.787
Did actors in the past,
and I have two words for them:

42:04.789 --> 42:06.656
Never again.

42:06.658 --> 42:08.424
I just thought maybe
you two knew each other.

42:08.426 --> 42:09.492
Maybe you met before.

42:09.494 --> 42:11.461
When? When would we have
met before?

42:11.463 --> 42:13.162
Please, enlighten me.

42:13.164 --> 42:16.933
Maybe your modeling days
when you first got to la.

42:16.935 --> 42:20.069
Oh, god, no,
I hadn't, christian.

42:20.071 --> 42:21.671
But you know, who knows?

42:21.673 --> 42:23.473
I was pretty wasted
during those days.

42:23.475 --> 42:25.308
So anything's possible, right?

42:26.710 --> 42:27.944
Come on.

42:27.946 --> 42:30.613
Christian, why are you
asking me these things?

42:30.615 --> 42:33.082
No reason. You're the one
getting all defensive.

42:33.084 --> 42:35.051
I'm chill, baby.

42:35.053 --> 42:37.820
Why are you asking me
about ryan?

42:37.822 --> 42:40.924
I just thought maybe
the two of you had met before.

42:40.926 --> 42:45.128
No. Nope.
We had not.

42:45.130 --> 42:47.463
We had not met before.

42:48.699 --> 42:52.201
I'm gonna get another.
You want one?

42:52.203 --> 42:53.603
Yeah.

42:53.605 --> 42:56.839
After that interrogation,
give me a fucking double.

42:58.609 --> 43:00.543
How was your day?

43:01.512 --> 43:03.446
Did you go to the gym today?

43:05.349 --> 43:08.284

- Hey, babe.
- How'd it go?

43:55.934 --> 43:59.702
Uh, I don't think I got it.
Too many other guys.

43:59.704 --> 44:01.704
I'm sorry, babe.

44:07.711 --> 44:09.679
What are you doing?

44:09.681 --> 44:12.382
Christian does yoga
with cynthia gray?

44:12.384 --> 44:14.851
What?

44:14.853 --> 44:16.719
I'm just looking
at his schedule.

44:16.721 --> 44:18.054
Do you know her?

44:18.056 --> 44:20.390
Yeah. Actually, I was
in an acting class with her

44:20.392 --> 44:21.891
A few years ago.

44:21.893 --> 44:24.560
Weird to see
her name again.

44:24.562 --> 44:27.697
So she's teaching yoga now.
Typical.

44:27.699 --> 44:29.232
Right, that's exactly
what christian's doing

44:29.234 --> 44:32.335
When he's over with cynthia.
It's yoga. Sure.

44:35.572 --> 44:38.474
So I had lunch
with tara today.

44:38.476 --> 44:40.576
- You did?
- Yeah.

44:44.581 --> 44:46.115
You okay?

44:46.117 --> 44:48.851
Yeah. Yeah, I just...

44:48.853 --> 44:50.653
I don't know. I guess
I'm a little surprised

44:50.655 --> 44:52.288
After what you told me
about her last night.

44:52.290 --> 44:55.958
Yeah, I know, but christian
asked me to go, so...

44:55.960 --> 44:58.261
- Why?
- I don't know.

44:58.263 --> 45:00.863
It was like he wanted me
to find out something.

45:00.865 --> 45:03.866
- Like what?
- I really don't know.

45:03.868 --> 45:05.968
Afterwards, it just confirmed
everything he already knew,

45:05.970 --> 45:08.337
Which is that she doesn't
wanna have anything more

45:08.339 --> 45:09.906
To do with the movie.

45:09.908 --> 45:11.908
What else did she say?

45:11.910 --> 45:13.810
Well, I don't think
she believed me

45:13.812 --> 45:16.979
When I told her you thought
christian was cool.

45:16.981 --> 45:20.116
- Why would you tell her that?
- Huh?

45:20.118 --> 45:23.086
That... why would you say that
I thought christian was cool?

45:23.088 --> 45:26.756
What does it matter? You don't
care that I said that, right?

45:29.293 --> 45:30.693
Ryan?

45:33.030 --> 45:35.765
You can tell her
whatever you want, babe.

45:39.903 --> 45:42.171
I mean,
I don't even know her.

45:43.874 --> 45:46.075
She also seemed...

45:46.077 --> 45:49.112
I don't know,
she seemed scared.

45:49.114 --> 45:51.981
Really anxious.

45:51.983 --> 45:54.350
She kinda reminded me
of like one of those girls

45:54.352 --> 46:00.123
In those movies that's being
followed by somebody.

46:00.125 --> 46:03.493
I... I don't know.
It was just very weird.

46:54.278 --> 46:56.412
- Hey!
- Hey. Is everything okay?

46:56.414 --> 46:59.248
I mean, you said we couldn't
talk about this on the phone.

46:59.250 --> 47:00.516
I asked gina
what this was about.

47:00.518 --> 47:02.585
- She had no idea.
- Ryan, it's okay.

47:02.587 --> 47:04.520
Close the door.

47:04.522 --> 47:06.656
But why?

47:06.658 --> 47:09.492
Uh, there's no one here.

47:10.761 --> 47:13.462
Close the door, ryan.

47:20.604 --> 47:22.004
Can we make this fast?

47:22.006 --> 47:24.140
I'd rather just stand,
if that's okay.

47:24.142 --> 47:25.441
What's going on?

47:25.443 --> 47:27.510
Why are you calling me
to the office

47:27.512 --> 47:29.478
At 11:00 at night, jon?

47:29.480 --> 47:31.881
Look, I'll be upfront.

47:31.883 --> 47:34.851
Gerald is still having problems
with you for the lead.

47:34.853 --> 47:36.352
I know you've known this,

47:36.354 --> 47:39.222
And even though you've been
officially cast for this,

47:39.224 --> 47:40.723
He's reconsidering.

47:40.725 --> 47:42.491
You're fucking kidding me.

47:42.493 --> 47:45.494
No. I'm not
fucking kidding you.

47:49.466 --> 47:51.367
What does this mean?

47:52.603 --> 47:54.637
What does
"reconsidering" mean?

47:54.639 --> 47:58.007
We're shooting in a month, jon.
I put my whole life on hold.

47:58.009 --> 47:59.675
Sit down.

48:05.449 --> 48:08.851
Well...

48:08.853 --> 48:12.889
I'm the one with the direct line
to chris and gerald.

48:12.891 --> 48:14.724
Has gina been told about this?

48:14.726 --> 48:16.959
No, gina hasn't been
told about this.

48:16.961 --> 48:21.564
If gina hasn't been told about
this, then why am I here?

48:21.566 --> 48:22.932
I'm calling her.

48:22.934 --> 48:27.536
No, don't.
Put the phone away.

48:27.538 --> 48:30.039
Ryan, put the phone down!

48:31.575 --> 48:34.410
I can make sure
you keep the role.

48:36.680 --> 48:37.980
Yeah?

48:40.083 --> 48:41.217
How's that?

48:42.719 --> 48:47.623
Well, I'm going out to, uh,

48:47.625 --> 48:50.359
Palm springs this weekend,
and, uh...

48:50.361 --> 48:54.697
Well, why don't you come?

48:55.933 --> 48:58.167
Aren't you going with billy?

48:58.169 --> 48:59.435
No.

49:00.938 --> 49:02.939
You mean me and gina?

49:02.941 --> 49:06.175
No. Just, um...

49:07.477 --> 49:10.212
Just me and you.

49:12.683 --> 49:15.818
Well...

49:15.820 --> 49:21.190
Sure. Why not? But...

49:21.192 --> 49:22.558
Why wait?

49:22.560 --> 49:23.926
Exactly.

49:23.928 --> 49:25.995
Let's do it now.

49:25.997 --> 49:27.596
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

49:27.598 --> 49:29.365
Suck me off right now.

49:29.367 --> 49:32.001
Right here. Now.
In the office.

49:32.003 --> 49:33.469
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

49:33.471 --> 49:36.038
Come on. Get to work.
Fuckin' put it in your mouth.

49:36.040 --> 49:38.040
Seriously?

49:38.042 --> 49:39.742
Seriously. Come on.

49:39.744 --> 49:42.078
I need to get off.
Make it hard.

49:42.080 --> 49:44.380
Is this what you want?

49:44.382 --> 49:48.684
Suck me off right now.
You know you want it.

50:09.373 --> 50:12.108
Hey, cynthia?

50:12.110 --> 50:16.912
Hey, uh, this is ryan from
suzie waiter's acting class.

50:16.914 --> 50:21.717
Yeah, yeah, I know. It's...
it's been a long time.

50:21.719 --> 50:25.721
Listen, I wanted
to ask you something.

51:23.313 --> 51:25.848
Who is this?

51:51.274 --> 51:53.709
I'm going out.
Amber texted me.

51:53.711 --> 51:56.479
We're gonna have a drink
or see a movie or something.

51:56.481 --> 51:58.247
Cool.

51:58.249 --> 51:59.882
Really? That's it?

51:59.884 --> 52:02.918
You're not gonna ask me where
I'm going or when I'll be home?

52:02.920 --> 52:03.986
Nothing?

52:03.988 --> 52:07.456
No. I trust you, baby.

52:07.458 --> 52:09.425
Okay.

52:09.427 --> 52:11.760
I'm gonna
take a shower first.

53:59.803 --> 54:03.105
Okay. I'm going out.
I'll be back in a bit.

54:03.107 --> 54:05.874
Okay.

54:05.876 --> 54:07.876
What are you gonna do?

54:07.878 --> 54:10.512
Go online.

54:10.514 --> 54:12.715
Look for somebody to be here
when you get back.

54:12.717 --> 54:15.417
Oh, okay.
Really? Tonight?

54:15.419 --> 54:17.853
Yeah. Really.

54:17.855 --> 54:20.055
Okay.

54:25.128 --> 54:26.695
You smell nice.

54:26.697 --> 54:28.297
Thank you.

54:48.184 --> 54:50.185
Hey, it's me.

54:50.187 --> 54:53.389
I need you to come over now.

54:56.327 --> 55:00.062
<i>♪ Not another second to lose</i>

56:24.482 --> 56:28.350
- So, you remember me?
- No, I don't.

56:28.352 --> 56:32.855
Yeah, I used to date christian,
you know, before I met you.

56:32.857 --> 56:35.557
- Great.
- You don't seem surprised.

56:35.559 --> 56:37.793
Honestly, I don't really care
who christian dated.

56:37.795 --> 56:39.795
And why would I be surprised?

56:39.797 --> 56:43.031
Christian went out with
a lot of girls before me,

56:43.033 --> 56:44.633
And I don't care.

56:44.635 --> 56:48.103
Well, I would.
I would care.

56:48.105 --> 56:50.172
Cynthia...

56:50.174 --> 56:53.542
Really don't have a clue,
do you?

56:53.544 --> 56:57.646
You don't know anything about me
and christian, do you?

56:57.648 --> 57:00.182
All right, you know what?

57:00.184 --> 57:02.117
Lay it out, babe.
What kind of trouble am I in?

57:02.119 --> 57:04.286
Tara, you know,
I have enough of a clue

57:04.288 --> 57:06.789
To get into contact with you.

57:06.791 --> 57:10.626
Okay, because I think, you need
to get out of this relationship.

57:10.628 --> 57:13.829
I think you need
to get away from him.

57:16.933 --> 57:18.967
Really?

57:18.969 --> 57:20.369
Why?

57:20.371 --> 57:23.839
Because he's sick.
He's a sick little boy.

57:25.708 --> 57:27.042
Go on.

57:28.611 --> 57:32.314
I mean, even though he was,
you know, fucking other girls,

57:32.316 --> 57:37.085
There were, of course, the
hookups that we did together.

57:37.087 --> 57:39.955
I never wanted to.
I mean, he...

57:39.957 --> 57:41.790
Always pressured me into them.

57:41.792 --> 57:44.359
Really?
You didn't want to?

57:44.361 --> 57:47.162
I'm assuming he does
the same thing with you.

57:49.232 --> 57:51.300
Just finish your fucking story,
cynthia.

57:51.302 --> 57:53.101
I need to get the hell
outta here.

57:53.103 --> 57:55.471
Not really a story. No.

57:55.473 --> 57:59.007
Just that moment when everything
became clarified for me.

57:59.009 --> 58:02.077
You know, one night
when things got out of hand.

58:03.413 --> 58:04.680
How?

58:04.682 --> 58:09.685
I found myself
in the emergency room at ucla.

58:09.687 --> 58:12.921
Hmm. How did that happen?

58:12.923 --> 58:16.158
Christian decided to invite a
bunch of guys over to the house.

58:16.160 --> 58:18.160
And you let him.

58:18.162 --> 58:19.561
No.

58:19.563 --> 58:22.865
Actually, I didn't.
I was passed out.

58:24.301 --> 58:26.301
And who's fault was that,
cynthia, hmm?

58:26.303 --> 58:28.403
Your precious christian
decided to crush up

58:28.405 --> 58:30.839
A bunch of rufelin in a drink
that he gave me.

58:30.841 --> 58:32.908
I never called him "precious,"
first of all.

58:32.910 --> 58:34.776
I believe that was your name.

58:34.778 --> 58:37.379
Secondly, it's "rohypnol."

58:37.381 --> 58:40.148
- Third of all...
- you know what I meant.

58:40.150 --> 58:41.283
I don't believe you.

58:41.285 --> 58:43.118
Really.

58:43.120 --> 58:45.187
You don't.

58:46.556 --> 58:49.491
So what are you saying, cynthia?
What are you saying?

58:51.594 --> 58:54.897
You saying that you didn't
let yourself get gang banged,

58:54.899 --> 58:58.066
- That you had no control...
- he filmed the entire thing,

58:58.068 --> 58:59.868
And then he threatened
to put it up on different sites

58:59.870 --> 59:01.937
If I said anything
to anybody.

59:01.939 --> 59:04.873
Obviously you weren't in control
of christian. I am.

59:04.875 --> 59:07.175
I'm telling you this because
I think he's gonna hurt you

59:07.177 --> 59:08.610
In the same way.

59:08.612 --> 59:10.812
No, you're telling me this
because you're jealous

59:10.814 --> 59:12.681
And a little drunk.

59:12.683 --> 59:15.150
God, it's such
a girl-thing to do.

59:21.057 --> 59:23.191
Look, christian's
not gonna hurt me.

59:23.193 --> 59:26.395
If anything, I'm the one
that's gonna hurt him.

01:00:13.676 --> 01:00:16.411
She's on her way back.

01:00:16.413 --> 01:00:18.580
We got 20 minutes.

01:00:19.749 --> 01:00:22.651
We are now hacking into
ryan's facebook page

01:00:22.653 --> 01:00:24.353
Because you have to be friends
with him to look at it.

01:00:24.355 --> 01:00:25.887
Bla bla bla.

01:00:25.889 --> 01:00:30.325
And privacy block is on,
photos locked.

01:00:30.327 --> 01:00:32.060
Is she friends with him?

01:00:32.062 --> 01:00:33.829
No.

01:00:33.831 --> 01:00:35.697
Are you sure?

01:00:35.699 --> 01:00:38.200
Dude, I've been your tech guy
for like three years.

01:00:38.202 --> 01:00:40.769
What is up with the paranoia?
I've never seen you like this.

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:45.874
Stop.

01:00:55.385 --> 01:00:58.887
Christian, uh, you wanted me
to check the phone?

01:01:01.124 --> 01:01:04.159
Think I found those deleted
texts you wanted me to see.

01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:07.362
Um, not a lot of them,
but, uh,

01:01:07.364 --> 01:01:11.900
I don't know what this means,
but it was sent to...

01:01:11.902 --> 01:01:15.003
It was sent to ryan's phone.

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:21.643
How quickly can you hack
into his bank account?

01:01:50.673 --> 01:01:52.040
Who was that?

01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:53.542
Who?

01:01:53.544 --> 01:01:55.544
The guy that just
walked out of the house.

01:01:55.546 --> 01:01:58.046
Who in the fuck do you think
I'm talking about?

01:01:58.048 --> 01:02:00.215
Oh, he brought me some weed.

01:02:00.217 --> 01:02:02.284
You're such a liar.

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:06.455
How does that make me a liar?

01:02:08.057 --> 01:02:09.524
It's not just that.

01:02:12.662 --> 01:02:14.596
How was amber?

01:02:16.132 --> 01:02:18.133
I wouldn't know.
I didn't see amber.

01:02:18.135 --> 01:02:19.668
- You didn't?
- Nope.

01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:20.836
Where'd you go?

01:02:26.142 --> 01:02:28.410
Who's cynthia?

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:33.482
I don't know
who you're talking about.

01:02:35.052 --> 01:02:36.785
Stop fucking lying, christian.

01:02:36.787 --> 01:02:38.987
I know lots of cynthias.
What I meant was

01:02:38.989 --> 01:02:41.690
I don't know which cynthia
you're referring to.

01:02:42.725 --> 01:02:44.159
Fine. Okay.

01:02:44.161 --> 01:02:47.229
Someone texted me because they
wanted to talk to me about you.

01:02:47.231 --> 01:02:50.365
Turns out that it's some girl
you dated on the east side,

01:02:50.367 --> 01:02:52.234
And not only did you
put her in the hospital,

01:02:52.236 --> 01:02:54.202
But you invited
a bunch of fucking guys over

01:02:54.204 --> 01:02:56.204
And then pulled a fucking train
on her, christian.

01:02:56.206 --> 01:02:58.340
- I know the whole thing.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:02:58.342 --> 01:02:59.875
- That didn't fucking happen!
- Christian, what the fuck?

01:02:59.877 --> 01:03:01.710
- Oh, right, I'm sure.
- No, look.

01:03:01.712 --> 01:03:03.545
I dated a girl named cynthia
before you...

01:03:03.547 --> 01:03:04.713
Now you remember.

01:03:04.715 --> 01:03:07.415
But none of that other shit
happened.

01:03:07.417 --> 01:03:09.484
All right?

01:03:09.486 --> 01:03:12.220
You're such a fucking liar.

01:03:12.222 --> 01:03:13.688
I swear to god!

01:03:13.690 --> 01:03:15.357
If it happened,
I would tell you.

01:03:15.359 --> 01:03:16.825
It didn't fucking happen.

01:03:16.827 --> 01:03:18.393
I don't know why
she would say that.

01:03:18.395 --> 01:03:19.561
- I have no fucking clue.
- Me either!

01:03:19.563 --> 01:03:20.962
I don't know why
she would say that either.

01:03:20.964 --> 01:03:23.665
She's fucking on drugs,
and she's obsessed with me.

01:03:23.667 --> 01:03:26.401
I don't know what the fuck is
wrong with... I-I don't know.

01:03:26.403 --> 01:03:27.869
What kind of drugs
was she on? Roofies?

01:03:27.871 --> 01:03:31.206
I have no idea. She's crazy.
I don't fucking know.

01:03:31.208 --> 01:03:35.811
She probably is jealous that
I'm with you instead of her.

01:03:35.813 --> 01:03:37.345
- But it did not happen.
- She's on drugs.

01:03:37.347 --> 01:03:38.380
Yes.

01:03:38.382 --> 01:03:40.315
If it happened,
I would tell you.

01:03:40.317 --> 01:03:42.584
I swear to god.

01:03:42.586 --> 01:03:45.921
- But it did not.
- Oh. Thanks.

01:03:45.923 --> 01:03:49.124
It didn't though.
I swear.

01:03:49.126 --> 01:03:51.693
Okay.

01:03:54.564 --> 01:03:56.898
Who's that?

01:03:58.201 --> 01:04:00.535
Nobody. It's... Whoever.
Nobody.

01:04:01.537 --> 01:04:04.139
Christian, who is that?

01:04:04.141 --> 01:04:06.007
It's just somebody
I invited over,

01:04:06.009 --> 01:04:07.309
But we can do it
another night.

01:04:07.311 --> 01:04:10.879
It's fine.
We can cancel.

01:04:10.881 --> 01:04:13.782
No. Tell 'em to come over.

01:04:13.784 --> 01:04:17.285
Are you sure?
I mean, they're close, but...

01:04:17.287 --> 01:04:19.921
No. Don't cancel.

01:04:21.290 --> 01:04:23.792
Where you going?

01:04:28.564 --> 01:04:32.100
Tell 'em to meet me upstairs.

01:04:32.102 --> 01:04:33.668
Yeah?

01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:37.138
- They wanna use the pool first.
- Great. Whatever.

01:04:42.778 --> 01:04:44.679
They're here.

01:04:44.681 --> 01:04:46.348
Let 'em in.

01:05:22.952 --> 01:05:26.922
It's a little less than that.

01:05:26.924 --> 01:05:29.124
It's always nice to cool off.

01:05:29.126 --> 01:05:32.327
Ooh, it's cold out there.

01:05:32.329 --> 01:05:34.362
It's warmer upstairs.

01:05:34.364 --> 01:05:35.997
Let's go upstairs.

01:05:55.718 --> 01:05:58.019
This is tara.

01:05:59.755 --> 01:06:01.523
Come on in.

01:06:18.174 --> 01:06:19.774
Come here.

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:25.313
Hello.

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:38.660
Let me see my girls together,
come on.

01:06:38.662 --> 01:06:40.929
Yeah, that's right.
That's what I wanna see.

01:06:40.931 --> 01:06:42.998
I wanna see
the two of you together.

01:06:46.569 --> 01:06:48.470
Just lie down.

01:06:50.172 --> 01:06:52.607
Kiss him.
Fucking kiss him.

01:06:54.443 --> 01:06:57.379
- Fucking kiss him.
- Come on, baby.

01:06:58.347 --> 01:07:00.615
Now this is what
I wanna to see.

01:07:05.488 --> 01:07:07.622
Kiss him.
Kiss him more.

01:07:23.172 --> 01:07:25.407
Go down on him.

01:07:25.409 --> 01:07:28.476
No, no, no.
Not you. Him.

01:07:30.146 --> 01:07:31.913
Go, jerry.

01:07:37.953 --> 01:07:40.221
You listen to me, okay?

01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:43.091
Thank you.

01:08:15.391 --> 01:08:18.393
- Strange how things work out.
- How do you mean?

01:08:18.395 --> 01:08:22.197
Well, I remember liking you,
and then you ended up with tara.

01:08:22.198 --> 01:08:23.832
Then I remember
liking christian,

01:08:23.834 --> 01:08:26.334
And he ended up with tara.

01:08:26.336 --> 01:08:28.336
I don't know
if I'm gonna find a guy,

01:08:28.337 --> 01:08:30.872
Maybe I just need
to get out of la.

01:08:30.874 --> 01:08:35.410
Yeah, it's a pretty
fucked-up town, isn't it?

01:08:35.412 --> 01:08:38.313
Sure you don't wanna stay,
maybe grab some lunch?

01:08:38.314 --> 01:08:40.081
I just wanted to come by
and hear what happened

01:08:40.082 --> 01:08:41.716
And to thank you in person.

01:08:41.718 --> 01:08:44.886
It sounded like a weird request,
but I appreciate it.

01:08:44.888 --> 01:08:47.421
You took it a lot further
than I thought. Thanks.

01:08:47.424 --> 01:08:49.591
First acting gig
I've had in years.

01:08:51.227 --> 01:08:53.361
You really love tara?

01:08:53.363 --> 01:08:56.397
Yeah. I mean,
I'm with someone, but yeah.

01:08:56.399 --> 01:08:57.499
I'm sorry.

01:08:57.501 --> 01:09:00.301
Ryan, I let that go
a long time ago.

01:09:00.303 --> 01:09:04.772
You realize that you have to let
it go, too, at a certain point?

01:09:04.774 --> 01:09:06.140
I know.

01:10:36.098 --> 01:10:38.099
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Why are you following me?

01:10:38.101 --> 01:10:40.134
What the fuck are you doing?
What do you want, huh?

01:10:40.136 --> 01:10:41.369
I don't know you!

01:10:41.371 --> 01:10:44.205
I know who sent you!
Come on, admit it!

01:10:44.207 --> 01:10:46.674
Fucking christian!

01:10:46.676 --> 01:10:48.810
You want my picture, huh?
You want my picture?

01:10:48.812 --> 01:10:49.911
Where's your phone?
Give it!

01:10:49.913 --> 01:10:52.347
Nobody wants
your picture, okay?

01:10:54.917 --> 01:10:56.684
I know, okay?

01:10:56.686 --> 01:10:58.920
Tell christian I know
what the fuck he's doing.

01:10:58.922 --> 01:11:00.788
Tell that piece of shit
I know!

01:11:19.642 --> 01:11:21.709
What the fuck?

01:11:35.991 --> 01:11:38.726
This can't be my phone.

01:11:38.728 --> 01:11:40.361
Fuck.

01:13:34.511 --> 01:13:36.077
What are you doing?

01:13:36.079 --> 01:13:38.613
I was just looking
for my phone.

01:13:38.615 --> 01:13:39.981
Did you find it?

01:13:39.983 --> 01:13:43.551
Christian, why is my phone
in your drawer?

01:13:43.553 --> 01:13:46.120
- Yeah, christian...
- did you find it?

01:13:46.122 --> 01:13:48.756
- Christian, why was my phone...
- I know about you and ryan!

01:13:48.758 --> 01:13:50.291
You fucking lying bitch!

01:13:50.293 --> 01:13:52.727
Are you gonna fucking
admit it? Are you?

01:13:52.729 --> 01:13:53.895
- Oh, shit!
- Are you gonna admit it

01:13:53.897 --> 01:13:55.897
After I beat
the fucking shit out of you?

01:13:55.899 --> 01:13:57.398
You fucking lied to me!

01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:00.301
I trusted you,
and you lied to me!

01:14:00.303 --> 01:14:03.137
- Christian...
- You lied!

01:14:03.139 --> 01:14:09.177
Please! I really don't know
what you're talking about!

01:14:10.345 --> 01:14:12.413
Jesus!

01:14:20.222 --> 01:14:23.491
Oh, my god, I can't believe
how late I slept.

01:14:26.061 --> 01:14:27.962
How was your run?

01:14:32.568 --> 01:14:36.671
Babe, why are you drinking
tequila at noon?

01:14:38.874 --> 01:14:40.374
Ryan.

01:14:40.376 --> 01:14:44.645
I'm glad your boss
is seeing a shrink.

01:14:44.647 --> 01:14:47.248
I've been looking
at christian's schedule.

01:14:47.250 --> 01:14:49.317
Dr. Campbell, 3:00.

01:14:49.319 --> 01:14:51.686
How do you know that
dr. Campbell's a shrink?

01:14:51.688 --> 01:14:53.921
Stop it.
I googled him.

01:14:53.923 --> 01:14:56.157
What are you doing,
protecting this psycho?

01:14:56.159 --> 01:14:58.059
Why do you even care?

01:14:58.061 --> 01:15:00.728
Because he's a sick fuck.

01:15:00.730 --> 01:15:04.198
Ryan, I told you, you don't
have to like him. Wha...

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:06.734
The movie's
not gonna happen, gina.

01:15:06.736 --> 01:15:08.402
I really don't know what
you're talking about right now.

01:15:08.404 --> 01:15:09.804
- The movie's not...
- the movie's happening.

01:15:09.806 --> 01:15:11.239
The movie's not gonna happen.

01:15:11.241 --> 01:15:13.474
Ryan, what did...
okay, stop. What did jon...

01:15:13.476 --> 01:15:15.243
It's not jon.
It's not gerald.

01:15:15.245 --> 01:15:17.512
It's not you. It's him.
It's christian.

01:15:17.514 --> 01:15:19.480
He's not gonna
let the movie happen.

01:15:19.482 --> 01:15:21.382
- You need to calm down.
- He's gonna pull out.

01:15:21.384 --> 01:15:23.551
- He's gonna fuckin' pull out.
- What are you talking about?

01:15:23.553 --> 01:15:26.721
I don't understand.
What? I don't understand!

01:15:26.723 --> 01:15:29.357
It's not gonna happen because
I've been fucking his girlfriend

01:15:29.359 --> 01:15:32.193
For the last month.

01:15:32.195 --> 01:15:37.265
It's not gonna happen because...
I'm in love with her.

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:42.136
That's why tara stopped
working on the movie.

01:15:42.138 --> 01:15:45.640
I never told you this, but
we lived together for a year.

01:15:45.642 --> 01:15:47.041
Me and tara.

01:15:47.043 --> 01:15:50.044
She dumped me when she started
hooking up with christian.

01:15:50.046 --> 01:15:52.613
I hadn't seen her
in three years

01:15:52.615 --> 01:15:55.082
Until that day I walked
into the audition room,

01:15:55.084 --> 01:15:57.585
And then it started again.

01:15:57.587 --> 01:16:00.187
And christian found out.

01:16:00.189 --> 01:16:01.856
He's had me followed,

01:16:01.858 --> 01:16:03.958
He's fucked with
my bank account,

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:06.260
He's insane, and he knows
about me and tara.

01:16:06.262 --> 01:16:10.097
That's why the movie's not
gonna happen, okay? Got it?

01:16:14.703 --> 01:16:17.371
I love you, baby.

01:16:17.373 --> 01:16:19.974
You believed in me.

01:16:19.976 --> 01:16:25.780
You helped me so much,
but I... I can't control it,

01:16:25.782 --> 01:16:27.949
How I feel about her.

01:16:35.023 --> 01:16:36.991
But she'll never be with you.

01:16:36.993 --> 01:16:41.062
She's not going back to that.

01:16:41.064 --> 01:16:44.231
We can talk about this
as much as you want.

01:16:44.233 --> 01:16:48.102
I'll spend all day
talking about this,

01:16:48.104 --> 01:16:50.805
And then I want you
out of here.

01:16:50.807 --> 01:16:52.506
I want you to take
all your things,

01:16:52.508 --> 01:16:54.609
And I want you out of here.

01:16:56.078 --> 01:16:57.945
And then I'm going
to beg christian

01:16:57.947 --> 01:16:59.313
To keep the movie going.

01:16:59.315 --> 01:17:01.115
I don't care how much
I have to degrade myself.

01:17:01.117 --> 01:17:03.117
I will beg him
to keep the movie going.

01:17:03.119 --> 01:17:04.852
And I will make sure
that you are not

01:17:04.854 --> 01:17:06.587
Within a hundred miles
of that set

01:17:06.589 --> 01:17:09.090
For the duration
of the shoot.

01:17:12.828 --> 01:17:15.496
Usually I'm the one
in control.

01:17:15.498 --> 01:17:17.732
Last night I wasn't.

01:17:17.734 --> 01:17:19.867
None of it seemed real.

01:17:19.869 --> 01:17:21.736
Not when that guy
was sucking my dick

01:17:21.738 --> 01:17:24.372
Or when tara tried
to get him to fuck me.

01:17:24.374 --> 01:17:26.674
Which didn't happen, fyi.

01:17:29.344 --> 01:17:30.878
There were certain things

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:34.949
That tara and the other girl
wanted us to do,

01:17:34.951 --> 01:17:39.220
And I don't even know
why I care.

01:17:39.222 --> 01:17:43.858
Just some dumb kids on the
internet I'll never see again.

01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:47.695
Just...

01:17:47.697 --> 01:17:49.697
Didn't feel like
I wasn't in control.

01:17:49.699 --> 01:17:52.767
I felt objectified.

01:17:52.769 --> 01:17:55.002
The way the two of them
just watched

01:17:55.004 --> 01:17:58.272
And told us what to do.

01:18:00.242 --> 01:18:02.677
Doesn't usually go down
like that.

01:18:02.679 --> 01:18:06.013
Usually I'm the one
directing the scene.

01:18:07.283 --> 01:18:09.483
It made me feel
like an actor.

01:18:09.485 --> 01:18:13.354
It's kinda like
how I feel when I'm here.

01:18:13.356 --> 01:18:15.022
You feel like an actor
when you are here?

01:18:15.024 --> 01:18:19.260
We're all actors, aren't we?
I mean...

01:18:19.262 --> 01:18:20.995
We all act differently,

01:18:20.997 --> 01:18:24.699
Depending on the situation
we're in or we're around.

01:18:24.701 --> 01:18:29.837
I don't act the same way with
you as I do when I'm with tara.

01:18:29.839 --> 01:18:34.375
Just last night and here...

01:18:34.377 --> 01:18:36.377
Were pronounced,

01:18:36.379 --> 01:18:40.114
That... Disconnect.

01:18:40.116 --> 01:18:43.884
So do you worry about being
an actor when you're here?

01:18:43.886 --> 01:18:46.520
It doesn't worry me.
I just don't like it.

01:18:46.522 --> 01:18:51.192
I don't like to feel
like I'm not in control.

01:18:51.194 --> 01:18:54.729
Have you processed that
coming here is non-negotiable?

01:18:54.731 --> 01:18:56.597
That it's mandatory?

01:18:56.599 --> 01:18:58.599
Have you been able
to accept that?

01:18:58.601 --> 01:19:00.534
You mean
have I processed it?

01:19:00.536 --> 01:19:02.536
I processed it.
I've accepted it.

01:19:02.538 --> 01:19:04.105
I just don't like it.

01:19:04.107 --> 01:19:05.873
Every day I think
what'll happen

01:19:05.875 --> 01:19:08.609
If I don't go back to
dr. Campbell's next week.

01:19:08.611 --> 01:19:11.278
This thought
is always on my mind.

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:13.247
And the answer is?

01:19:15.784 --> 01:19:18.152
If I miss a session,
you will call the asshole.

01:19:18.154 --> 01:19:20.855
- The asshole being...
- My father.

01:19:20.857 --> 01:19:23.891
And if I told your father
you're missing sessions?

01:19:23.893 --> 01:19:28.229
Then the asshole will pull my
trust fund if I miss a session.

01:19:32.501 --> 01:19:34.268
What are you thinking?

01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:38.906
I'm thinking have I been here
long enough yet?

01:19:38.908 --> 01:19:40.641
And the answer is?

01:19:56.458 --> 01:19:58.225
Yeah, it's me.

01:19:58.227 --> 01:20:01.829
You there?
I got your little message.

01:20:01.831 --> 01:20:05.065
Ryan, ryan, ryan.

01:20:05.067 --> 01:20:08.068
Poor, poor ryan.

01:20:10.338 --> 01:20:12.606
It all seemed so exciting

01:20:12.608 --> 01:20:14.842
When you were 18,
and that photographer found you,

01:20:14.844 --> 01:20:20.614
<i>Class trip from michigan,</i>
<i>all the way out to los angeles.</i>

01:20:20.616 --> 01:20:22.316
<i>Yeah, hollywood.</i>

01:20:22.318 --> 01:20:23.984
<i>And you were suddenly</i>
<i>so far away</i>

01:20:23.986 --> 01:20:26.287
<i>From that shithole town</i>
<i>you grew up in,</i>

01:20:26.289 --> 01:20:28.255
<i>So you did</i>
<i>some modeling shoots.</i>

01:20:28.257 --> 01:20:30.457
<i>Everyone was so encouraging.</i>

01:20:30.459 --> 01:20:33.694
You even did
a commercial or two.

01:20:33.696 --> 01:20:37.598
I saw one on youtube
for pringles.

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:39.600
Looked like a fucking moron.

01:20:40.635 --> 01:20:42.937
<i>Then what, huh?</i>

01:20:42.939 --> 01:20:44.738
<i>Nothing.</i>

01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:46.540
<i>Nada.</i>

01:20:46.542 --> 01:20:48.542
<i>So now you're bartending with</i>
<i>the occasional hotel gig</i>

01:20:48.544 --> 01:20:50.244
<i>To supplement your income.</i>

01:20:50.246 --> 01:20:52.780
<i>That's just 'cause randall</i>
<i>wants to fuck you up the ass.</i>

01:20:52.782 --> 01:20:54.915
<i>Who knows?</i>
<i>You'd probably let him.</i>

01:20:54.917 --> 01:20:57.818
<i>He probably has.</i>

01:20:57.820 --> 01:21:01.021
<i>What happened last October</i>
<i>at the post ranch inn, huh?</i>

01:21:01.023 --> 01:21:02.823
You tell gina about that?

01:21:02.825 --> 01:21:05.492
I doubt you told gina
about that romantic drive

01:21:05.494 --> 01:21:12.499
All the way up the coast
to the post ranch inn.

01:21:12.501 --> 01:21:14.768
And then bam!

01:21:14.770 --> 01:21:18.372
You reconnect with tara
last July.

01:21:18.374 --> 01:21:19.940
And then bam!

01:21:19.942 --> 01:21:22.142
She convinces everyone
to cast you in a movie

01:21:22.144 --> 01:21:24.945
You're not even capable
of acting in.

01:21:24.947 --> 01:21:26.413
And then bam!

01:21:26.415 --> 01:21:28.616
You're fucking my girlfriend.

01:21:28.618 --> 01:21:30.918
<i>And bam!</i>

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:34.788
<i>You convince cynthia to tell</i>
<i>everyone some bullshit story.</i>

01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:37.091
<i>So what, huh?</i>

01:21:37.093 --> 01:21:40.494
<i>You get tara to dump me?</i>

01:21:40.496 --> 01:21:43.564
So you guys can,
what, run away together?

01:21:45.967 --> 01:21:48.202
Get married?

01:21:48.204 --> 01:21:49.970
So you can, what,

01:21:49.972 --> 01:21:52.840
Coexist in some
dump of a house somewhere?

01:21:54.609 --> 01:21:57.177
Think tara's going back
to that kind of life?

01:21:57.179 --> 01:22:00.114
You think she's going
to that lifestyle again?

01:22:00.116 --> 01:22:02.283
You want my advice, ryan?

01:22:02.285 --> 01:22:04.418
Go back to michigan
and get over it,

01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:07.488
You clueless
little motherfucker.

01:22:19.834 --> 01:22:21.201
What are you doing here?

01:22:21.203 --> 01:22:23.337
I just wanted
to talk to you.

01:22:23.339 --> 01:22:24.738
Why?

01:22:31.479 --> 01:22:32.980
Ryan.

01:22:34.516 --> 01:22:39.186
I had no idea
that you two knew each other.

01:22:39.188 --> 01:22:41.188
Interesting how small
this town really is.

01:22:41.190 --> 01:22:43.691
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:22:43.693 --> 01:22:47.962
Come on, babe.
Your little story?

01:22:50.332 --> 01:22:53.167
- What story?
- The ucla hospital.

01:22:53.169 --> 01:22:55.936
Bunch of guys
running a train on you.

01:22:55.938 --> 01:22:58.238
There's no way
that kid's smart enough

01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:01.408
To come up with that
on his own.

01:23:01.410 --> 01:23:03.677
But I know somebody who is.

01:23:03.679 --> 01:23:07.114
What was I supposed to do?

01:23:07.116 --> 01:23:08.582
It worked, babe.

01:23:08.584 --> 01:23:12.619
You wanted my attention,
and you got it. Here I am.

01:23:12.621 --> 01:23:15.122
Come here, smarty pants.

01:23:17.525 --> 01:23:20.761
I'm not mad.
I thought it was cute.

01:23:22.464 --> 01:23:25.566
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

01:23:25.568 --> 01:23:29.837
Did you really think I would
need to slip a girl a roofie?

01:23:29.839 --> 01:23:31.472
No.

01:23:34.743 --> 01:23:37.111
What I am interested in...

01:23:40.048 --> 01:23:42.282
Is how you guys
know each other.

01:23:42.284 --> 01:23:44.051
Oh, it doesn't matter.

01:23:44.053 --> 01:23:46.787
Yeah, but I am curious.
How'd you meet?

01:23:46.789 --> 01:23:48.956
Do you like him?

01:23:48.958 --> 01:23:51.258
Have you fucked him?
Has he got a big dick?

01:23:51.260 --> 01:23:55.162
Okay, yes, I... I met him
before he knew tara.

01:23:55.164 --> 01:23:57.698
We had the same
acting class together.

01:23:57.700 --> 01:24:01.168
And yes, we had a thing,
and then he met her,

01:24:01.170 --> 01:24:03.303
And then it was over.

01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:07.775
Very interesting.

01:24:07.777 --> 01:24:09.977
Interesting?

01:24:11.079 --> 01:24:12.679
Really?

01:24:17.552 --> 01:24:19.386
Why?

01:24:21.289 --> 01:24:24.191
And why does it even matter
to you anymore?

01:24:24.193 --> 01:24:27.027
What did you think
she was doing?

01:24:27.029 --> 01:24:31.865
I mean, I don't know, she dated
him for like a year or so,

01:24:31.867 --> 01:24:33.934
And then she dumped him.

01:24:35.670 --> 01:24:37.638
We didn't know each other
very well back then.

01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:39.440
I mean, we went to like
a few of the same parties,

01:24:39.442 --> 01:24:41.608
And I think we dated
a few of the same guys,

01:24:41.610 --> 01:24:45.345
But we weren't really friends
or anything.

01:24:45.347 --> 01:24:47.548
And then she met you.

01:24:48.716 --> 01:24:49.783
Christian?

01:24:53.354 --> 01:24:54.855
Christian, what are you doing?

01:24:57.559 --> 01:24:59.193
Hello?

01:25:01.262 --> 01:25:02.896
Christian?

01:25:18.113 --> 01:25:19.913
Christian, what the fuck?

01:25:26.588 --> 01:25:29.556
Christian! No! No!

01:25:36.565 --> 01:25:38.532
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

01:25:39.701 --> 01:25:42.236
Why don't you
fucking answer?

01:25:43.271 --> 01:25:45.873
Pick up the fucking phone!

01:25:57.785 --> 01:26:00.621
Can't believe
what you did to her, dude.

01:26:00.623 --> 01:26:03.524
You are one sick fuck.

01:26:28.283 --> 01:26:29.883
Cynthia?

01:27:35.516 --> 01:27:37.150
Hi.

01:27:37.152 --> 01:27:38.819
Hi.

01:27:41.389 --> 01:27:43.724
Where were you?

01:27:43.726 --> 01:27:45.392
Dr. Campbell's.

01:27:47.128 --> 01:27:49.997
What's that?

01:27:51.232 --> 01:27:52.733
Um...

01:27:55.503 --> 01:28:00.574
I'm gonna leave, okay?

01:28:00.576 --> 01:28:05.178
I'm gonna go stay with my sister
in santa barbara for a bit.

01:28:12.487 --> 01:28:17.124
I'm sorry about this morning.
About...

01:28:17.126 --> 01:28:18.892
About everything.

01:28:18.894 --> 01:28:22.896
Yeah, I know.
I know. I'm sorry, too.

01:28:31.539 --> 01:28:33.607
But I'm gonna leave anyway.

01:28:33.609 --> 01:28:36.843
I just... I need to hear
that you're okay with it.

01:28:36.845 --> 01:28:39.880
I wanna know that
you're okay with me going.

01:28:39.882 --> 01:28:42.149
Please.

01:28:51.426 --> 01:28:54.328
Will you please
just let me go?

01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:01.034
I loved you.

01:29:03.037 --> 01:29:07.374
I really... Loved you.

01:29:09.745 --> 01:29:12.913
In my own way,
but I loved you.

01:29:12.915 --> 01:29:15.849
I know, I know.

01:29:15.851 --> 01:29:18.585
I loved you, too.

01:29:18.587 --> 01:29:23.023
But I... I just need
to think about things.

01:29:23.025 --> 01:29:26.560
And I need to hear you say
that it's okay if I go.

01:29:30.898 --> 01:29:31.965
It's okay.

01:29:35.436 --> 01:29:36.803
I'll be fine.

01:29:36.805 --> 01:29:38.705
Thank you.

01:29:38.707 --> 01:29:41.608
Thank you.

01:29:43.312 --> 01:29:45.078
I need something from you.

01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:47.581
Yes, anything. Tell me.

01:29:47.583 --> 01:29:49.616
What do you need?

01:29:49.618 --> 01:29:50.784
An alibi.

01:29:54.055 --> 01:29:57.357
Wha... What?

01:29:57.359 --> 01:29:59.559
For what?

01:29:59.561 --> 01:30:02.062
This afternoon.

01:30:07.201 --> 01:30:10.003
I-I don't understand.
What happened this afternoon?

01:30:10.005 --> 01:30:11.805
You went to...

01:30:11.807 --> 01:30:13.273
You just said you went
to dr. Campbell's.

01:30:13.275 --> 01:30:16.777
What did you...
what else happened?

01:30:16.779 --> 01:30:20.147
Something happened to cynthia.

01:30:22.617 --> 01:30:24.084
Christian...

01:30:24.086 --> 01:30:25.519
Christian, what happened?

01:30:29.223 --> 01:30:30.624
It's not important.

01:30:30.626 --> 01:30:34.027
Uh, I don't...
what happened?

01:30:34.029 --> 01:30:35.529
I don't get...
I don't understand.

01:30:35.531 --> 01:30:37.631
What do you mean,
something happened?

01:30:37.633 --> 01:30:43.103
I left dr. Campbell's at 3:55.

01:30:43.105 --> 01:30:44.905
Got here at 4:20.

01:30:44.907 --> 01:30:49.109
You've been with me
ever since.

01:30:49.111 --> 01:30:51.011
Do you understand?

01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:58.218
Nod for me, baby.

01:30:58.220 --> 01:31:00.954
Nod for me.

01:31:06.461 --> 01:31:08.395
One more thing.

01:31:11.866 --> 01:31:15.602
If you ever see him again,

01:31:15.604 --> 01:31:18.104
If he ever contacts you,

01:31:18.106 --> 01:31:21.007
If he calls you,

01:31:21.009 --> 01:31:23.577
If you're even
in the same room together...

01:31:28.216 --> 01:31:30.584
I will kill him.

01:31:30.586 --> 01:31:32.619
Look at me.

01:31:32.621 --> 01:31:37.023
I will kill him,
and I will get away with it.

01:31:41.762 --> 01:31:43.864
You understand?

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:47.367
Yes.

01:31:49.070 --> 01:31:51.204
Nod for me, baby.

01:31:56.177 --> 01:31:57.477
Nod for me.

01:31:57.479 --> 01:31:59.613
Okay, okay.

01:32:00.615 --> 01:32:04.317
That's a good girl.

01:32:05.786 --> 01:32:07.354
Good girl.

01:32:23.404 --> 01:32:26.573
So, you guys
just got back from dubai.

01:32:26.575 --> 01:32:29.242
Yeah, we stayed
at the burj al arab.

01:32:29.244 --> 01:32:31.244
I thought you had a bad
experience at the burj?

01:32:31.246 --> 01:32:33.480
Thought you were only staying
at the atlantis now?

01:32:33.482 --> 01:32:35.081
Yeah, but tara
had never been to dubai,

01:32:35.083 --> 01:32:36.550
So I thought
it'd be fun for her.

01:32:36.552 --> 01:32:39.653
It didn't matter to me.
I was in meetings all day.

01:32:39.655 --> 01:32:43.757
So how was dubai?
What'd you do there?

01:32:43.759 --> 01:32:47.827
You know, just shopped,
laid out.

01:32:47.829 --> 01:32:51.331
Weren't you working
on a movie?

01:32:54.001 --> 01:32:56.336
Yeah, uh, kind of.

01:32:56.338 --> 01:32:59.406
Yeah. How'd you know?

01:32:59.408 --> 01:33:03.043
- We have a friend in common.
- Who?

01:33:03.045 --> 01:33:05.478
Christian.

01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:07.314
Didn't you
used to go out with him?

01:33:07.316 --> 01:33:09.783
Yeah.

01:33:09.785 --> 01:33:11.952
He's producing another movie
a friend of mine is in,

01:33:11.954 --> 01:33:14.688
And jaden told me that you and
christian used to live together

01:33:14.690 --> 01:33:18.091
And when I met you tonight,
I just put it all together.

01:33:18.093 --> 01:33:22.329
Yeah, christian and I
went out for about a year.

01:33:22.331 --> 01:33:23.863
And then when we broke up,

01:33:23.865 --> 01:33:26.199
I decided to take myself
off the film.

01:33:26.201 --> 01:33:28.735
Oh, I'm sorry.
Was the breakup that bad?

01:33:28.737 --> 01:33:30.904
No. No, not at all.

01:33:30.906 --> 01:33:34.908
No, it's just, there were
a lot of things going on and...

01:33:34.910 --> 01:33:36.376
Wait, wasn't that...

01:33:36.378 --> 01:33:39.412
Was that around the time
when that girl was killed?

01:33:39.414 --> 01:33:43.249
Christian's yoga instructor
or something?

01:33:45.620 --> 01:33:47.153
Yeah, actually...

01:33:47.155 --> 01:33:51.224
Yeah, it was right around that
time that we broke up, yeah.

01:33:51.226 --> 01:33:54.294
They never found out
who did that, did they?

01:33:56.831 --> 01:33:59.899
No. I mean,
they had some suspects,

01:33:59.901 --> 01:34:02.535
But aside from that, no.

01:34:02.537 --> 01:34:04.504
At the end, nothing.

01:34:04.506 --> 01:34:08.875
Didn't they find like a knife in
the car of someone's assistant?

01:34:08.877 --> 01:34:14.214
Yeah, but... I mean,
I heard that it was basically

01:34:14.216 --> 01:34:17.317
Whoever killed
the person, her,

01:34:17.319 --> 01:34:19.019
Must have thrown it
in his car.

01:34:19.021 --> 01:34:23.490
I mean, I was with him that
night, so it wasn't him, but...

01:34:23.492 --> 01:34:25.959
Yeah, after that...

01:34:25.961 --> 01:34:28.828
So they never
arrested anybody?

01:34:28.830 --> 01:34:30.830
No. Actually, no, they didn't.

01:34:30.832 --> 01:34:33.500
That's so scary.

01:34:33.502 --> 01:34:34.601
Yeah.

01:34:34.603 --> 01:34:38.471
How is christian doing,
by the way?

01:34:38.473 --> 01:34:40.473
Christian,
he's, um, he's good.

01:34:40.475 --> 01:34:42.475
We don't really talk
that much,

01:34:42.477 --> 01:34:45.512
Aside from texts
and facebook and stuff.

01:34:45.514 --> 01:34:47.914
But the last time I heard
from him was pretty recent,

01:34:47.916 --> 01:34:51.518
And he's doing great,
actually.

01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:55.588
Gonna go to the ladies' room.
I'll be right back.

01:35:05.066 --> 01:35:07.267
Good, good. I'm glad
you guys had a good time.

01:35:07.269 --> 01:35:10.003
- She's cute, man.
- Yeah, she's cute.

01:35:26.854 --> 01:35:29.956
Hey! It's me.

01:35:29.958 --> 01:35:33.093
Yeah, I'm here with her
right now.

01:35:33.095 --> 01:35:36.629
Yeah, we went to david's place
first for drinks.

01:35:37.798 --> 01:35:40.200
So... What do you
want me to do?

01:35:40.202 --> 01:35:42.402
Anything you want me
to ask her

01:35:42.404 --> 01:35:45.171
Besides what you
already told me to?

01:35:45.173 --> 01:35:49.943
She seems happy, even though
she's like totally faking it.

01:35:51.345 --> 01:35:52.512

01:35:52.514 --> 01:35:55.582
