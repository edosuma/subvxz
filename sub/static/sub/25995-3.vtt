00:00.296 --> 00:01.583
We've acquired intelligence

00:01.619 --> 00:04.062
on a possible terrorist
attack on a London school.

00:04.098 --> 00:07.601
One of the schools threw up a
link to a serving police officer.

00:07.637 --> 00:09.081
His kids attend.

00:09.117 --> 00:10.199

(SIRENS)

00:21.260 --> 00:23.546
Strictest confidence, but
you've got a right to know -

00:23.581 --> 00:25.102
it happened near your
children's school.

00:25.137 --> 00:25.825
What?

00:25.861 --> 00:27.506
(EXPLOSION)

00:27.541 --> 00:28.546
(CHILDREN SCREAM)

00:28.581 --> 00:30.506
How do you know the name
of my kids' school?

00:30.541 --> 00:32.746
It must've appeared in the immediate
incident report.

00:32.781 --> 00:34.826
The attack occurred only a few
minutes before.

00:34.861 --> 00:36.866
It seems a bit early for the
connection to be made.

00:36.901 --> 00:39.186
How do you reckon she'd feel

00:39.221 --> 00:41.306
- if she got a taste?
- Taste of what?

00:41.341 --> 00:43.146
Suffering the consequences.

The bullets can't get through the

00:52.701 --> 00:55.946
Shooter's located on roof
of Pascoe House 1,000 feet south

00:55.981 --> 00:57.586
of Thornton Circus.

00:57.621 --> 00:58.820
(SHOUTING) Armed police!

01:00.380 --> 01:02.466
I'm starting to lose confidence

01:02.501 --> 01:04.866
in the police's ability to make
rapid enough progress,

01:04.900 --> 01:08.226
so I'd like to take up Stephen's
proposal for the Security Service

01:08.261 --> 01:10.786
to assume a role in interviewing
the 1/10 bombers. What?

01:10.821 --> 01:15.026
Thank you. Home Secretary, you are
setting a dangerous precedent.

01:15.061 --> 01:19.106
We agree, I think, this can only be
a police matter.

01:19.141 --> 01:21.706
PM's pissed off. Thinks you're
hogging the limelight.

01:21.741 --> 01:24.186
Naturally I disabused him of the
idea that you're rogue enough

01:24.221 --> 01:26.066
to attempt a leadership challenge.

01:26.101 --> 01:28.106
We were under attack, you, me...

01:28.141 --> 01:30.226
...members of the public.
Terry was blown apart.

01:30.261 --> 01:32.306
- Ma'am, are you all right?
- Who would give that order,

01:32.341 --> 01:35.146
to hold resources back and leave us
in the line of fire?

01:35.181 --> 01:39.106
That would be an executive officer
at SO15.

01:39.141 --> 01:40.426
Anne Sampson.

01:40.461 --> 01:43.146
My surveillance team will issue you
with the necessary equipment

01:43.181 --> 01:44.584
to monitor her meetings.

01:44.620 --> 01:45.986
Is that lawful, ma'am?

01:46.021 --> 01:48.266
They're having almost daily
conferences and keeping

01:48.301 --> 01:49.786
me out of the loop. Why?

01:49.821 --> 01:50.979
No idea, ma'am.

01:51.015 --> 01:52.626
I see this all the time, David.

01:52.661 --> 01:55.306
The minister ingratiates
themselves with the PPO.

01:55.341 --> 01:57.746
You think it's out of the
goodness of their heart.

01:57.781 --> 02:00.146
It's so you'll keep their secrets,
no matter what.

02:00.181 --> 02:02.285
We had some good news
about my son's schooling.

02:02.321 --> 02:02.986
I'm glad.

02:03.021 --> 02:06.226
She'd been given prior intelligence
it was a target.

02:06.261 --> 02:09.066
But she sat back
and let it happen.

02:09.101 --> 02:11.106
She's got you wrapped
round her finger.

02:11.141 --> 02:13.546
You've got to finish the job.

How long were you in the Army?

02:25.340 --> 02:26.540
Ten years.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.700
Is that what you always wanted
to do?

02:32.900 --> 02:34.867
You'll probably laugh, but...

02:35.267 --> 02:37.346
...when I was in school I
wanted to be a doctor.

02:39.580 --> 02:40.780
I'm not laughing.

02:42.620 --> 02:43.740
What happened?

02:46.700 --> 02:49.186
To get into medical school
you need work experience.

02:49.221 --> 02:50.311
How do you get that?

02:50.678 --> 02:52.546
By knowing a doctor
who can get you in.

02:52.581 --> 02:55.220
I had no idea where to start, so...

02:57.260 --> 02:58.460
...I never applied.

03:03.580 --> 03:04.780
They don't hurt?

03:05.780 --> 03:07.020
Not now.

03:09.020 --> 03:10.460
I'm one of the lucky ones.

03:11.820 --> 03:12.900

One possible reason.

04:37.341 --> 04:38.386
What do you mean?

04:38.421 --> 04:41.980
The only plausible conclusion is
your itinerary was leaked.

04:44.180 --> 04:46.951
By the police? They set me up.

04:47.141 --> 04:49.580
And it's obvious why.
Home Secretary?

04:51.020 --> 04:52.220
Our arrangement.

04:53.220 --> 04:56.319
No-one knows, I can assure you
of that.

04:56.741 --> 04:59.706
In regard to which, we need to
establish

04:59.741 --> 05:02.860
the most secure means of getting
the material to you.

05:04.300 --> 05:05.460
Not via the office.

I just need to use the loo.

Sorry, Skipper. We don't have any

they're still in danger?

09:03.781 --> 09:05.340
No, but there was.

09:06.660 --> 09:09.866
I'll be completing a review of the
threat-to-life assessment.

09:09.901 --> 09:12.826
Extending their stay at the safe
house will be weighed against

09:12.861 --> 09:15.260

priorities in our budget.

09:28.141 --> 09:30.906
but SO15 want to interview you about
Thornton Circus.

09:30.941 --> 09:32.546
I gave them a full
statement at the time.

09:32.581 --> 09:35.780
Still, the IOPC's involved,
so they want to dot the I's.

- Hi.

09:55.517 --> 09:57.306
Are you OK to talk to us?

09:57.341 --> 09:59.066
You want Legal or your
Fed rep or anything?

09:59.101 --> 10:00.580
- Happy to help.
- Great stuff.

DCI Sharma.

10:12.795 --> 10:13.795
PS Budd.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.986
OK, David. We're grateful
for your written statement,

10:17.021 --> 10:18.555
but we'd like you
to take us through,

10:18.591 --> 10:19.898
just in as much detail as possible,

10:19.933 --> 10:21.738
the events on the roof
of Pascoe House.

10:22.101 --> 10:24.626
It's all as per my statement.

10:24.661 --> 10:27.746
The shooter was exactly where I'd
seen him, the roof of Pascoe House.

10:27.781 --> 10:31.826
He was dressed as a workman
and equipped with a PSL.

10:31.861 --> 10:35.461
When the ARVs arrived,
he decided there was no way out.

10:36.260 --> 10:37.906
How come he didn't see you?

10:37.941 --> 10:39.940
I was observing
from a covered position.

10:41.620 --> 10:43.420
Why did he turn the
pistol on himself?

10:44.860 --> 10:47.666
As you'll know from my statement,
I attempted to arrest him.

10:47.701 --> 10:50.626
I called, "Armed police" and ordered
him to surrender his firearm.

10:50.661 --> 10:52.508
He chose not to comply.

10:54.420 --> 10:55.312
Well.

10:55.348 --> 10:57.986
So he didn't say anything
that might reveal a motive?

10:58.021 --> 11:00.626
In firing on the
Home Secretary's vehicle, I mean.

11:00.661 --> 11:02.066
I'm afraid not, sir.

11:02.101 --> 11:04.666
Well, unfortunately, we haven't been
able to ID the gunman

11:04.701 --> 11:06.866
or trace the firearm either.

11:06.901 --> 11:08.186
It takes some doing,

11:08.221 --> 11:10.826
getting a weapon like that
and leaving no trace.

11:10.861 --> 11:13.066
Look, if there's anything you can
tell us about him,

11:13.101 --> 11:15.060
it would be a big help,
anything at all.

11:17.940 --> 11:19.180
Sorry.

11:21.038 --> 11:22.238
We've got these...

11:23.774 --> 11:27.026
...images from the CCTV cameras
on the roof.

11:27.061 --> 11:29.426
Yeah, they appear to show
a significant verbal exchange

11:29.461 --> 11:31.306
between you and the gunman.

11:31.466 --> 11:34.545
But unfortunately your mouths
aren't visible for lip reading.

11:36.047 --> 11:37.866
Yeah, he'd repeated
a number of times

11:37.901 --> 11:39.700
he had no intension to surrender.

11:41.740 --> 11:43.786
See, one thing that occurs to me,
David...

11:43.821 --> 11:45.380
It's OK if I call you David?

11:46.620 --> 11:49.860
The shooter had a firearm that
could blow half your body away.

11:50.857 --> 11:53.263
Why didn't he use it on you
and make a getaway?

11:53.501 --> 11:56.906
As per my statement,
that firearm was packed away

11:56.941 --> 11:59.786
and the ARVs arrived.

11:59.821 --> 12:02.066
If he'd got past me,
he'd have nowhere to run to.

12:02.101 --> 12:03.426
See, David, this is the thing.

12:03.461 --> 12:06.346
This guy he's a complete stranger,
yeah.

12:06.381 --> 12:09.826
Yet, somehow, you know for certain
when he sees the ARVs

12:09.861 --> 12:11.980
he decided to throw in the towel?

12:14.100 --> 12:17.746
No. You're quite right, sir.
I couldn't know that.

12:18.571 --> 12:22.941
I made an assumption,
which was reinforced

12:22.977 --> 12:25.146
by the shooter's final
comments to me.

12:25.423 --> 12:28.739
But I am happy
to amend my statement accordingly

12:28.775 --> 12:30.399
if that would assist your inquiry.

12:36.100 --> 12:39.386
OK. Thank you very much, David.

12:39.475 --> 12:41.594
- Sorry I couldn't be more help.
- It's OK.

12:48.220 --> 12:51.186
Interview terminated at 14:48.

12:51.564 --> 12:53.641
We'll send someone in
to show you out.

13:11.207 --> 13:12.693
One moment, please.

13:12.783 --> 13:14.462
(DOOR BEEPS AND UNLOCKS)

13:25.439 --> 13:26.759
All clear, ma'am.

13:27.620 --> 13:29.386
Is anything the matter?

13:29.514 --> 13:30.703
No.

13:31.383 --> 13:33.068
The family still
not back at home?

13:33.127 --> 13:35.078
The safe house has
been extended.

13:35.461 --> 13:37.688
There's no other option,
really, with everyone

13:37.865 --> 13:39.829
in the dark about whether
they're still a target.

13:40.399 --> 13:41.946
Well, you can always come to me.

13:42.160 --> 13:45.159
That would be asking you
to circumvent security protocol.

16:53.047 --> 16:54.459
Longcross.

16:54.752 --> 16:56.151
Richard Longcross.

18:16.820 --> 18:19.026
The shooter signed into Pascoe House
as Adrian Smith,

18:19.061 --> 18:21.266
but that appears to be a false name.

18:21.301 --> 18:23.666
We're pursuing the theory
he might be ex-Forces, so we've

18:23.701 --> 18:26.066

something promising.

He's doing his best to avoid the
cameras, but this one's grabbed him.

18:43.142 --> 18:45.181
This is the night
before the shooting.

18:48.632 --> 18:50.872
And that appears
to be the same gun bag.

Secretary's vehicle.

by the same person, or persons,

19:50.221 --> 19:52.706
proving there's a
wider conspiracy.

19:52.741 --> 19:55.226

gunman was part of it, too.

to any conclusions,

20:26.621 --> 20:28.321

deadliest threat still

20:28.357 --> 20:30.178
comes from the possibility
of another bombing.

their best to glean as

- Unfortunately not.

Right. Well, thank you, Stephen.

20:41.779 --> 20:45.178
Before I go, Home Secretary, perhaps
I could have a word in private?

to view the material?

he's got to be Security Service.

<i>Casualties, many of them
in a critical condition, have been</i>

<i>transferred to two of
London's four Major Trauma Centres.</i>

53:39.101 --> 53:42.146
<i>Just to be clear, we still have
no official confirmation from</i>

53:42.181 --> 53:45.346
<i>Downing Street or from the
Home Office that the Home Secretary,</i>

53:45.381 --> 53:48.226
<i>Julia Montague,
was among those injured in the blast</i>

53:48.261 --> 53:50.066
<i>at St Matthew's College.</i>

53:50.101 --> 53:52.729
<i>She was of course recently the
target of an assassination attempt</i>

53:52.765 --> 53:53.666
<i>by a sniper.</i>

53:53.702 --> 53:55.867
Rob Macdonald,
Special Advisor to the Home Secretary.

53:55.903 --> 53:57.944
Tony Steel, Chief Executive.
And you are?

53:57.980 --> 53:59.701
Jane Flannery, Media Liaison.

53:59.741 --> 54:02.860
OK, great. No statements,
re the Home Secretary's condition.

was giving a keynote speech...</i>

(PHONE VIBRATES)

54:09.980 --> 54:13.490
Hiya, Vic. No, I'm all right.

54:14.255 --> 54:16.626
I'm all right!
A few scratches, nothing serious.

54:16.661 --> 54:19.266
<i>The bill was spearheaded
by Julia Montague...</i>

54:19.685 --> 54:20.706
Yeah.

54:20.763 --> 54:21.459
Roger, Mike.

54:21.495 --> 54:23.546
This is Tony Steel, Chief
Exec of the hospital.

54:23.581 --> 54:25.276
- Hello.
- Jane Flannery, their Media Manager.

54:25.311 --> 54:26.450
How do you do?

54:26.486 --> 54:27.565
How do you do?

54:29.663 --> 54:30.903
What the hell happened?

54:32.340 --> 54:34.106
For fuck's sake, answer me.

54:34.141 --> 54:36.186
I heard there were security
breaches from the word go.

54:36.221 --> 54:38.786
Lawful protests
by civil liberties activists?

54:38.821 --> 54:40.165
You know what I mean.

54:40.201 --> 54:41.906
A search team under POLSA
direction swept the

54:41.941 --> 54:43.266
auditorium twice.

54:43.301 --> 54:45.596
- Everything was clear.
- Well, it wasn't, was it?!

54:45.632 --> 54:46.632
David.

54:49.316 --> 54:50.516
Sergeant!

54:53.860 --> 54:57.026
If anyone's got any doubts,
please run them by Number Ten.

54:57.061 --> 54:59.460
Thank you for all that you're doing.

<i>Division in Government,
splitting them from top to bottom.</i>

55:07.061 --> 55:10.266
<i>But it's also the case
that sometimes Julia Montague</i>

55:10.301 --> 55:14.066
<i>was accused of exploiting
the terror threat fear at home</i>

55:14.101 --> 55:16.180
<i>to try to further her own ambition.</i>

55:20.020 --> 55:21.860
Critical incident declared, ma'am.

JESIP's fully active

55:24.941 --> 55:26.906
Last of the casualties
are being transited out

55:26.941 --> 55:28.943
and Expo are searching
for further devices,

55:28.979 --> 55:29.979
none detected so far.

55:30.034 --> 55:31.115
Thanks, Deepak.

55:36.099 --> 55:39.279
Prints taken from the eventuell
compound match the shooters.

55:39.408 --> 55:40.808
At postmortem.

55:44.020 --> 55:46.927
We've got a screen-grab of CCTV
from the rental company.

55:46.990 --> 55:48.426
He used the name Adrian Smith -

55:48.461 --> 55:51.106
same alias he used to sign in to
Pascoe house as a tradesman.

55:51.141 --> 55:53.306
He completed the application online.

55:53.341 --> 55:57.026
The IP address leads to an
internet cafe in South London.

55:57.061 --> 55:59.426
Chances are he's London-based.

55:59.461 --> 56:01.866
After today's incident targeting
the Home Secretary again,

56:01.901 --> 56:03.872
we can't rule out a connection.

56:09.664 --> 56:13.294
Suggesting Adrian Smith
had at least one accomplice.

56:13.461 --> 56:16.346
SOPHIE RAWORTH: <i>Among the injured
was the Home Secretary herself.</i>

56:16.381 --> 56:18.786
<i>There's still no official statement
from Downing Street</i>

56:18.821 --> 56:21.666
<i>or the Home Office on her condition,
but it is believed that</i>

56:21.701 --> 56:23.546
<i>her injuries are severe.</i>

<i>Let's return now live...</i>
