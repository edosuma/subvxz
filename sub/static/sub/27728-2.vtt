Nothing.

been in the business

00:31.098 --> 00:32.566

00:32.566 --> 00:34.001
I need answers.

is a psychic bond.

00:35.903 --> 00:38.605

What did you do?

00:44.244 --> 00:46.313

Stop it, Max. Both of you.

with her a decade ago.

01:01.561 --> 01:04.197
I would give anything
to be able to ask her

01:04.197 --> 01:06.633

that she did.

01:06.633 --> 01:08.235
To understand her.

01:08.235 --> 01:11.772
But like so many who died
before their time,

01:11.772 --> 01:15.075
Rosa took her truth with her.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.678
And I'm left here...

01:17.678 --> 01:20.180
endlessly searching for it.

01:25.953 --> 01:28.755
Uh, this place closes at sunset.

01:28.755 --> 01:29.990
I jumped the gate.

01:31.325 --> 01:32.659
It's after midnight,

01:32.659 --> 01:36.263
so it's officially the ten-year
anniversary of Rosa's accident.

01:40.867 --> 01:43.203
So, uh...

01:43.203 --> 01:44.938
you gonna arrest me, Officer?

01:44.938 --> 01:47.107

No. Too much paperwork.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.678
It'll be our secret.

01:51.678 --> 01:54.648
Another one.

01:54.648 --> 01:56.216
Can I drive you home?

02:12.966 --> 02:14.568
Weirdly appropriate,

02:14.568 --> 02:16.803
getting driven home by a cop
tonight of all nights.

02:16.803 --> 02:19.973
Rosa would be proud.
Happy to oblige.

02:21.942 --> 02:24.211
Have you been avoiding me
these last few days?

02:24.211 --> 02:26.780
I thought maybe
you were freaked out.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.615
I wasn't avoiding you.

02:28.615 --> 02:30.884
It's just I never
really planned

02:30.884 --> 02:32.019
on staying in Roswell long.

02:32.019 --> 02:33.687
I was just passing through.

02:33.687 --> 02:34.788
So, you're leaving.

02:34.788 --> 02:39.526
I'm a scientist, Max.
It's what I do.

02:41.728 --> 02:45.165

vascular regeneration study.

You're gonna change the world.

02:52.706 --> 02:55.642
I always knew you would.

02:57.577 --> 03:00.280
I don't know why
that was so hard to tell you.

03:00.280 --> 03:05.185
Maybe the same reason
it was so hard to hear it.

Meet me at the old
turquoise mines?

03:32.512 --> 03:37.250
I can't, Liz, I told you.
Look.

You'll know that
my feelings are real,

side effect.

Where's that coming from?

24:36.742 --> 24:40.312
I... just had a memory of Rosa.

24:40.312 --> 24:43.482
It was written on
her hand and I...

24:43.482 --> 24:44.483
can't place it.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.785
Yeah, it's not astrology.

24:46.785 --> 24:49.722
It's a Third Eye Blind lyric
from "God of Wine."

24:49.722 --> 24:53.692
That's one of the songs
she used to play on the jukebox.

24:53.692 --> 24:55.494
Right. (chuckles)

24:55.494 --> 25:00.532
She was always scribbling lyrics
on her hands, her sneakers.

25:03.769 --> 25:05.304
Maria, what's wrong?

25:05.304 --> 25:08.507
I thought you didn't
see her that night.

25:08.507 --> 25:10.509
How do you remember that?

25:10.509 --> 25:12.878
What night?
Well, she...

25:12.878 --> 25:15.814
She left the diner,
then she came here.

25:15.814 --> 25:18.317
She was singing
that song.

25:18.317 --> 25:21.520
She wrote that lyric on her hand
right in front of me.

25:21.520 --> 25:22.721
Liz.

25:25.591 --> 25:28.327
That's the night she died.

25:35.334 --> 25:37.569
LIZ: Dr. Valenti knows I'm
coming! Kyle, are you in there?

25:37.569 --> 25:39.605
I need to see Dr. Valenti now.

25:39.605 --> 25:42.307
It's fine.
It's okay, she's fine.

25:42.307 --> 25:44.643
I have to see Rosa's autopsy.
It's important.
Listen to me.

25:44.643 --> 25:46.745
You can't tell anybody
what I'm about to tell you.

25:48.580 --> 25:50.449
I need you to trust me.

25:53.318 --> 25:55.354
That's the autopsy
I found on file.

25:59.625 --> 26:03.629
Benzos, barbiturates,
blunt force trauma to the head,

26:03.629 --> 26:06.899
postm...

26:09.968 --> 26:13.272
Postmortem burns to over 80...

26:13.272 --> 26:14.540
percent...

26:17.576 --> 26:18.877
I'm sorry.

26:20.279 --> 26:22.347
This is what everybody
said I would find.

26:22.347 --> 26:24.983
She was a drug addict
who drove her car into a tree.

26:26.285 --> 26:27.686
Maybe.

26:27.686 --> 26:30.589
But remember when we were kids
and I was at your house

26:30.589 --> 26:33.725
when Rosa was rushed to the ER
because her appendix burst?

26:33.725 --> 26:36.628
This marks her
appendix as present.

26:39.565 --> 26:41.934
Crappy medical examiner?

26:41.934 --> 26:43.836
Or a fake autopsy.

26:45.204 --> 26:48.273
I did some digging

26:48.273 --> 26:52.344
and I found the real one, but...

26:58.817 --> 27:00.752
(crying)

27:06.925 --> 27:09.094
Rosa...

27:11.830 --> 27:14.399
Your sister's death
wasn't an accident, Liz.

27:14.399 --> 27:18.403
And I know how crazy
this sounds, but...

27:18.403 --> 27:20.105
I think she
was murdered...

27:21.907 --> 27:24.142
by an alien.

27:29.248 --> 27:33.118
Go home, Isobel.
I'm not leaving until
you agree to talk to Max.

27:33.118 --> 27:36.321
Come on. This is the perfect
opportunity for you guys

27:36.321 --> 27:38.290
to get over all the ugly history
of the last decade

27:38.290 --> 27:39.157
and be friends again.

27:39.157 --> 27:41.193
Max and I were never
meant to be friends.

27:41.193 --> 27:43.328
We're family.
No.

27:43.328 --> 27:45.063
We're not.

27:45.063 --> 27:47.099
We all just happened to hitch
the same doomed ride

27:47.099 --> 27:49.568
on the same
intergalactic Titanic.

27:49.568 --> 27:53.272
The day Mr. and Mrs. Evans
walked into the group home,

27:53.272 --> 27:56.275
and they-they picked you two,
and they left me behind,

27:56.275 --> 27:58.243
that was decided.

27:58.243 --> 27:59.244
Max has spent his entire life

27:59.244 --> 28:01.346
trying to make up
for that one awful moment.

28:01.346 --> 28:02.881
It wasn't his fault.
We were seven.

28:02.881 --> 28:04.216
He was a
grown-ass man

28:04.216 --> 28:06.552
last week when he chose
Liz over us, Isobel.

28:06.552 --> 28:08.287
MAN: Pow! Pow!
(glass shatters)

28:08.287 --> 28:09.855
I mean, I must've hit
a transformer or something

28:09.855 --> 28:11.690
'cause the whole place
just exploded.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.792
So you shot out
some light bulbs.

28:13.792 --> 28:16.028
Those illegals
killed your sister.

28:16.028 --> 28:18.530
So let's send them back
where they came from.

28:23.902 --> 28:25.203
They're going to the Crashdown.

28:25.203 --> 28:27.039
If something happens
to Arturo or Liz...

28:27.039 --> 28:28.974
I'm sure Deputy Evans
will come to the rescue.

28:28.974 --> 28:30.642
Yeah, exactly,
he'll lose it.

28:30.642 --> 28:31.743
He's not himself
right now, Michael.

28:31.743 --> 28:33.946
I don't want him to do something
he can't take back.

28:36.381 --> 28:39.918
Yes, Max risked our lives
to save Liz.

28:39.918 --> 28:41.386
Okay? I am mad, too.

28:41.386 --> 28:44.022
But she was dying...
Mmm.

28:44.022 --> 28:46.959
...right in front
of him.

28:46.959 --> 28:49.995
Come on, Michael,

28:49.995 --> 28:51.863
is there really nobody
in this world

28:51.863 --> 28:53.999
that you wouldn't risk
everything to save?

28:56.935 --> 28:58.904
Sad.

29:13.251 --> 29:16.254
DISPATCH:
Central three.

29:16.254 --> 29:18.023
1000 Chestnut at 918...

29:19.925 --> 29:22.361
Uh, what alarm company
works at...

29:45.651 --> 29:47.919
NOAH:
Yo, Maximo.

29:47.919 --> 29:49.688
Hey.

29:49.688 --> 29:52.658
I'm headed home
to woo your sister.

29:52.658 --> 29:55.694
Gross. Did you get my message
about Gerardo Guerrera?

29:55.694 --> 29:56.995
Yeah, yeah,
I looked into it.

29:56.995 --> 29:58.764
He was cleared
of the shooting charges,

29:58.764 --> 30:01.566
but turns out Guerrera
is undocumented.

30:01.566 --> 30:03.301
So it doesn't matter
that he's not the shooter.

30:03.301 --> 30:04.503
He's in ICE custody now.

30:08.940 --> 30:11.143
(gasps)

30:13.912 --> 30:15.213
NOAH:
I'm sorry, man.

30:15.213 --> 30:17.115
Immigration is untouchable
these days.

30:17.115 --> 30:18.183
Yeah.

30:18.183 --> 30:20.152
You should get some sleep.
You're probably right.

30:20.152 --> 30:21.820
See you.

30:29.194 --> 30:30.796
(Arturo shouts)

30:34.533 --> 30:37.169
That's for my sister.
Get him up.

30:38.804 --> 30:41.206
If he ends up
in the hospital...

30:41.206 --> 30:43.108
Then he's gonna end up
in a van headed straight

30:43.108 --> 30:44.843
to the border, ain't he?

30:50.115 --> 30:51.883
Come on!
Let's go!

30:53.151 --> 30:54.486
You okay,
Mr. Ortecho?

30:54.486 --> 30:56.822
I-I think so.
Okay, I'll be back.

30:59.257 --> 31:02.294
Liz, I saw the handprint
on your chest the other night.

31:02.294 --> 31:04.029
I need to know who put it there.

31:04.029 --> 31:07.365
(crying)

31:21.346 --> 31:23.482
(crying):
He saw her.

31:26.151 --> 31:28.887
He saw her that night.
Who?

31:28.887 --> 31:30.222
Liz?

31:30.222 --> 31:31.857
I have to go.

31:39.464 --> 31:41.166
MAX:
Wyatt, stop!

31:45.370 --> 31:48.907
You gonna arrest me
for doing your job, huh?

31:48.907 --> 31:50.108
Be a man.

31:50.108 --> 31:51.476
(grunting)

32:01.987 --> 32:06.057
(grunts)

32:06.057 --> 32:08.093
The Ortechos were
worth all this?

32:08.093 --> 32:10.762
Mexico would've
wanted them.

32:12.697 --> 32:15.600
(crunches)

32:15.600 --> 32:16.802
(electricity sparking)

32:16.802 --> 32:17.936
(choking)

32:19.671 --> 32:21.640
Psycho...

32:22.741 --> 32:24.876
(high-pitched ringing)

32:26.845 --> 32:28.647
(yells)

32:35.754 --> 32:37.689
(groans)

32:43.762 --> 32:45.664
(panting)

32:45.664 --> 32:46.631
The hell?

32:46.631 --> 32:48.667
(electricity buzzing)

32:52.370 --> 32:54.906
We have got to stop
meeting like this.

32:54.906 --> 32:56.808
You have a taser?

32:57.876 --> 32:59.744
He'll be fine.

32:59.744 --> 33:00.745
He was gonna kill him.

33:00.745 --> 33:02.447
He killed Liz.

33:02.447 --> 33:05.417
Okay? She was dead right in
front of me, and he came back

33:05.417 --> 33:07.385
to finish her dad off.
People like him don't stop,

33:07.385 --> 33:08.787
they don't change.
So that makes you

33:08.787 --> 33:10.889
judge, jury and executioner.
Michael.

33:12.023 --> 33:14.359
ISOBEL: This
isn't you, Max.

33:14.359 --> 33:15.694
Something is wrong.
It has been for days.

33:15.694 --> 33:18.363
I can feel it, and so can you.

33:18.363 --> 33:20.699
(panting)

33:20.699 --> 33:21.967
You're right.

33:21.967 --> 33:25.637
Ever since I healed Liz,
there's been this

33:25.637 --> 33:29.374
poison inside me. I...

33:29.374 --> 33:31.710
I don't know.

33:36.348 --> 33:38.783
(exhales)

33:52.530 --> 33:54.366
(chuckles)

33:54.366 --> 33:56.201
All right,
who's the guy?

33:56.201 --> 33:57.569
Oh, come on. I know that look.

33:57.569 --> 33:59.404
From high school.

33:59.404 --> 34:02.507
Senior year,
the night that mystery guy

34:02.507 --> 34:03.842
kissed you
at the museum.

34:03.842 --> 34:05.610
Remember what you said to me?

34:05.610 --> 34:08.480
That I'd stay in Roswell,

34:08.480 --> 34:10.849
if only he kept kissing me.

34:10.849 --> 34:12.550
I was a dumb kid.

34:12.550 --> 34:15.220
(both laugh)

34:15.220 --> 34:17.455
It was the first time
I liked our hometown, though.

34:17.455 --> 34:21.293
Well, home doesn't have to mean
a white picket fence house

34:21.293 --> 34:22.761
and a family.

34:22.761 --> 34:24.462
It can be a person.

34:30.135 --> 34:31.469
Dad.

34:31.469 --> 34:33.238
I need to talk to you.

34:35.540 --> 34:36.508
(keys clatter)

34:36.508 --> 34:39.544
Papi, who did this to you?

34:39.544 --> 34:40.545
The Long boy.

34:40.545 --> 34:41.780
No te preocupes.

34:41.780 --> 34:43.515
The cops have him.

34:43.515 --> 34:46.151
Which cops, exactly?

34:46.151 --> 34:48.853
Max Evans. You just missed him.

34:48.853 --> 34:51.489
He patched me up.
He's a good kid.

34:51.489 --> 34:53.925
Comes in a lot,
orders coffee.

34:53.925 --> 34:57.662
Never drinks it,
but he tips well.

34:57.662 --> 35:00.332
He asks about you.

35:02.067 --> 35:04.336
He saved my life tonight.

35:11.142 --> 35:13.278
(wind gusting softly)

35:18.350 --> 35:22.387
Hey.

35:22.387 --> 35:24.255
So Wyatt Long shot me.

35:24.255 --> 35:26.658
For revenge,
because Rosa killed his sister.

35:26.658 --> 35:28.360
It wasn't just revenge.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.862
It's racism, you know?
Guys like that...

35:30.862 --> 35:33.865
Listen, I don't-I don't
want to talk about him.

35:33.865 --> 35:35.600
Okay? I have to tell you...

35:37.335 --> 35:38.503
...I lied to you.

35:40.472 --> 35:43.274
Ever since I healed you,
I've felt wrong,

35:43.274 --> 35:45.610
like there's a... like there's
a tornado inside me,

35:45.610 --> 35:48.580
and I can't fight it
and I can't run from it,

35:48.580 --> 35:50.215
except when I'm with you.

35:52.550 --> 35:53.518
I'm sorry.

35:53.518 --> 35:54.919
Max,

35:54.919 --> 35:57.255
the-the handprint faded,
and you were right.

35:57.255 --> 36:00.191
I don't feel the
way that you do.

36:02.527 --> 36:03.695
Yeah, no, of course.

36:03.695 --> 36:06.297
I-I get it. Uh...

36:06.297 --> 36:07.599
I'll just...

36:07.599 --> 36:09.834
Max.

36:09.834 --> 36:12.270
When's the last time
you saw Rosa?

36:12.270 --> 36:14.606
I've been thinking
about her all day,

36:14.606 --> 36:16.741
and I was just wondering.

36:20.245 --> 36:24.816
Uh, that day, when, um,
when I asked you to drive out

36:24.816 --> 36:27.786
to the desert with me
for the bio project.

36:29.254 --> 36:31.723
Right.

36:31.723 --> 36:34.626
Of course.
I thought so.

36:34.626 --> 36:37.262
So when are you leaving town?

36:38.363 --> 36:40.565
Uh, I-I think I might stay.

36:40.565 --> 36:42.867
My dad needs me,

36:42.867 --> 36:44.769
obviously, and, um,

36:44.769 --> 36:47.806
maybe I could help with
whatever's wrong with you.

36:47.806 --> 36:49.674
Do some tests?

36:49.674 --> 36:51.609
I don't want to be
an experiment.

36:51.609 --> 36:53.611
We could get to know each other.
