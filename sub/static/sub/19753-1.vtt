01:23.315 --> 01:24.647
Oh, yes. Mr. Scott.

01:24.649 --> 01:27.116
Thank you, sergeant. Sir.

01:32.022 --> 01:33.688
Mr. Scott, sir.

01:33.690 --> 01:36.223
Well, Mr. Scott. You must
be anxious to get at it.

01:36.225 --> 01:39.226
I thought you'd take a day or two
to get settled before showing up.

01:39.228 --> 01:42.495
Mrs. Scott seemed to have that
department pretty well in hand. I see.

01:42.497 --> 01:45.965
Nothing like somewhere to go while
the curtains are being hung, eh?

01:45.967 --> 01:47.733
That's about it, sir.
I know what you mean.

01:47.735 --> 01:51.136
Did you find a nice flat? Have they
fixed you up with a good office here?

01:51.138 --> 01:53.872
Quite all right on both counts.
Good.

01:53.874 --> 01:55.807
You'll want to take a good look
around before you take over.

01:55.809 --> 01:59.877
Find out what's going on. Then when
you're ready, we'll have a talk.

01:59.879 --> 02:02.613
Pretty thing, isn't it? Yes. It's
the new reindeer, isn't it, sir?

02:02.615 --> 02:07.284
Not hard to recognize by that tail. It's
made of the same metal as the plane.

02:07.286 --> 02:09.752
A new alloy they've developed.
Very nice.

02:09.755 --> 02:11.921
Major pearl will show you
everything you want to see.

02:11.923 --> 02:15.591
He knows more about the place than I do.
You're in good hands with him.

02:15.593 --> 02:17.859
We sometimes call him
"the pearl of great price."

02:17.861 --> 02:21.095
Good. I'm in your hands. I thought
we'd start in just after lunch.

02:21.097 --> 02:24.898
In an hour, a little more, you
could make a start. Yes, sir.

02:24.900 --> 02:27.834
Fine. I'll see you in the mess at 1:00.
Buy you a Sherry.

02:27.836 --> 02:31.938
I'm so glad you're here, Mr. Scott.
I've been looking forward to it.

02:31.940 --> 02:34.373
So have I, sir John.

02:34.375 --> 02:37.075
That's the original building...
the balloon shed.

02:37.077 --> 02:41.145
Began here with balloons in the '70s.
That's a very long time.

02:41.147 --> 02:44.081
All the strength tests to check
safety factor grouped here.

02:44.083 --> 02:47.784
Lot of work just to find out if the
engineer mucked up his mathematics.

02:47.786 --> 02:49.819
Nothing much to see
until something breaks,

02:49.821 --> 02:53.622
and that always happens
when you're somewhere else.

02:54.791 --> 02:59.360
Not much point in this. Flying boats
are pretty well obsolete, of course.

02:59.362 --> 03:01.995
Part of boffins' paradise,
this is. Mind your step.

03:01.997 --> 03:04.764
You know, the scientist lads.
Basic research.

03:04.766 --> 03:07.500
The kind who eat their
porridge with a slide rule.

03:07.502 --> 03:10.102
Built their own heaven here,
lightning and all,

03:10.104 --> 03:12.204
to find out what happens
when you get hit by it.

03:12.206 --> 03:16.141
Didn't put in any archangels, but it
wouldn't surprise me if they'd tried.

03:40.599 --> 03:43.933
What... what's that?

03:43.935 --> 03:46.735
Vibration test. What?

03:46.737 --> 03:49.037
Vi...

03:51.741 --> 03:53.774
Now, this is the test to...

03:53.776 --> 03:57.043
no, no, no, no! Now, major pearl...
uh, Mr. honey.

03:57.045 --> 03:59.879
This is Mr. Scott. He'll be
in charge of metallurgy.

03:59.881 --> 04:02.047
So you'll be working under him.
How do you do?

04:02.049 --> 04:04.382
I don't allow... quite an
arrangement you've got there.

04:04.384 --> 04:07.151
It's the tail group of the new
rutland reindeer. Yes, yes.

04:07.153 --> 04:08.986
What are you doing to it?
I'm vibrating it.

04:08.988 --> 04:12.356
I mean, what are you after? What
do you expect to happen to it?

04:12.358 --> 04:15.659
I expect the tail to fall off.
Excuse me, please.

04:26.037 --> 04:28.437
Right, Mr. Scott.

04:33.877 --> 04:35.710
This way. Who in
the world is he?

04:35.712 --> 04:38.279
That's Mr. honey. Mr. Theodore honey.
He's a yank.

04:38.281 --> 04:40.281
Rhodes scholar, I think,
but he's been here forever.

04:40.283 --> 04:44.118
What's all this about expecting the
tail of the new reindeer to fall off?

04:44.120 --> 04:45.385
They're already in service.

04:45.387 --> 04:49.622
Old honey has some wild hair in his ear that
vibration might cause metal fatigue someday...

04:49.624 --> 04:53.225
By breaking down the aluminum
atom in light alloy structures.

04:53.227 --> 04:55.060
Couldn't vibrate anything
little to find out.

04:55.062 --> 04:58.296
All boffins are a bit crackers,
but I suppose he's the worst.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.965
Airscrews are down there,
if you care to see them.

05:00.967 --> 05:03.167
Of course, they're
as dead as the dodo bird.

05:03.169 --> 05:05.969
Same as the engines. We'll
be all jet in no time.

05:20.817 --> 05:23.484
Good night, Mr. honey.

05:23.486 --> 05:25.819
Oh.

05:27.556 --> 05:31.758
There you are. Hurry up
there, please. Hurry.

05:31.760 --> 05:34.193
Four only.

05:43.402 --> 05:46.169
Mr. honey.
Can I give you a lift?

05:46.171 --> 05:48.604
Why, I seem to be
going your way.

05:48.606 --> 05:50.539
Oh. Oh, no. No, thank you.

05:50.541 --> 05:52.641
I wouldn't want to
take you out of your way.

05:52.643 --> 05:57.145
Where do you live? In farnham.
It's quite a way.

05:57.147 --> 05:58.579
I go right through there.

05:58.581 --> 06:02.449
I-I'll get a bus at the next stop.
I wouldn't want to trouble you.

06:02.451 --> 06:06.386
It's no trouble at all.
Come on. Jump in.

06:14.327 --> 06:19.129
Why don't you throw those in the back?
Uh, thank you.

06:22.400 --> 06:27.803
I was quite interested in that experiment
of yours, with the reindeer tail group.

06:27.805 --> 06:30.138
Would you like to tell me
just what your idea is?

06:30.140 --> 06:34.475
It's rather difficult to explain a thing
like that in words of one syllable.

06:34.477 --> 06:39.646
Well, I have managed as much as two
syllables on occasion, Mr. honey.

06:39.648 --> 06:41.514
Well, to put it
as simply as I can,

06:41.516 --> 06:44.884
the purpose of my work has been
to arrive at an end result...

06:44.886 --> 06:47.086
For the original
theoretical hypotheses...

06:47.088 --> 06:49.588
Of kerslinger of bâle
and schilgarde of uppsala,

06:49.590 --> 06:52.390
in which they postulate vibration
as a source of energy.

06:52.392 --> 06:56.460
I reasoned that since this energy does not
appear in any of the ordinary forms...

06:56.462 --> 06:58.462
Such as heat
or electrical potential,

06:58.464 --> 07:00.063
it must be absorbed
by the metal itself...

07:00.065 --> 07:04.967
And that sufficient absorption would result
in nuclear fission of the aluminum atom...

07:04.969 --> 07:09.304
In an isotopic form with
crystalline affinities.

07:09.306 --> 07:10.905
I see.

07:10.907 --> 07:14.275
And that means the tail will fall off.
Exactly.

07:14.277 --> 07:17.077
Oh, h-here's where I live.

07:32.194 --> 07:34.394
Thank you very much.

07:34.396 --> 07:36.896
You wouldn't...
would you care to come in?

07:36.898 --> 07:38.530
Thank you. I'd like to.

07:38.532 --> 07:42.300
Oh, I'm afraid all I can
offer you is some Sherry.

07:42.302 --> 07:44.001
That'd be very nice. Oh.

07:44.003 --> 07:46.370
Probably not very good.
I've had it quite a while.

07:46.372 --> 07:49.573
Perhaps it's time we tested it to
see if it's suffering from fatigue.

07:49.575 --> 07:53.176
Oh, that wouldn't happen
to Sherry. Well...

08:06.557 --> 08:08.890
Uh...

08:10.927 --> 08:13.427
oh, I'm so sorry.

08:16.832 --> 08:20.066
It's the one next door. It's
very easy to do, you know.

08:20.068 --> 08:22.401
You're new to farnham,
Mr. honey.

08:22.403 --> 08:25.704
We've lived here 11 years.

08:26.573 --> 08:29.707
I have it all planned...
what to have for dinner.

08:29.709 --> 08:31.408
Don't you bother with... oh.

08:31.410 --> 08:34.778
Hello. You don't remember where
we put that Sherry, dear?

08:34.780 --> 08:36.111
The top cupboard,
behind the dishes.

08:36.114 --> 08:39.682
You said it would be out of Mrs.
Higgins's way. Really?

08:39.683 --> 08:43.318
I didn't notice any...
up on the top.

08:43.320 --> 08:45.787
Oh! Oh, yeah.

08:46.122 --> 08:48.155
Oh, never mind.
I'll get that later.

08:48.157 --> 08:51.091
I knew it must be somewhere. I
never really forget anything.

08:51.093 --> 08:54.094
Dear, would you get some glasses, please?
Come in, won't you?

08:54.096 --> 08:56.796
We haven't had to look for it
for quite some time.

08:56.798 --> 08:58.731
The last guest we had
was Dr. gillingsworth...

08:58.733 --> 09:00.966
From the bacteriological
institute, just before Christmas.

09:00.968 --> 09:05.270
I'm afraid I'm giving you a good
deal of trouble. Oh, no. Not at all.

09:05.272 --> 09:07.639
Won't you sit down? Elspeth?

09:07.641 --> 09:12.343
There we are. Okay. Say when.

09:18.250 --> 09:21.050
I guess Mrs. Higgins did find it.
I'll get some more.

09:21.052 --> 09:25.054
I wish you wouldn't bother. Oh, no. It's
no trouble. It's around the corner.

09:25.056 --> 09:29.324
It needs some... elspeth,
will you entertain Mr...

09:29.326 --> 09:31.492
I don't believe you told
me your name. Scott.

09:31.494 --> 09:35.929
Scott, this is my daughter, elspeth.
I'll be right back.

09:40.869 --> 09:43.469
Uh... it's, uh... yeah.

09:43.471 --> 09:46.638
Won't you sit down, Mr. Scott?

09:46.640 --> 09:50.708
Uh, just where
would you suggest?

09:50.710 --> 09:54.912
Oh, I'm so sorry.
It's my father's work.

09:54.914 --> 09:56.880
You have to be very careful.

09:56.882 --> 10:00.750
It might be something
very important.

10:02.053 --> 10:04.019
There. Thank you.

10:04.021 --> 10:07.422
I seems as though your father
does quite a good deal of work.

10:07.424 --> 10:09.857
Yes, it's very hard
being a scientist.

10:09.859 --> 10:11.191
One has to think a great deal.

10:11.193 --> 10:15.628
The world would have made scarcely any progress
at all if it hadn't been for scientists.

10:15.630 --> 10:18.397
I see. The scientists do
the thinking for the world,

10:18.399 --> 10:21.066
and the rest of us just
live in it, is that it?

10:21.068 --> 10:24.636
Yes. When my father's
thinking, I keep very quiet.

10:24.638 --> 10:27.672
What about your mother? Does
she help you keep quiet?

10:27.674 --> 10:30.474
My mother is dead, Mr. Scott.
A v-2 in the war.

10:30.476 --> 10:34.611
I'm very sorry indeed, elspeth.
You must miss her very much.

10:34.613 --> 10:37.380
Yes, I do. My father
does more, I think.

10:37.382 --> 10:42.351
I try to do things for him the way she
did, but I'm not very good at it yet.

10:42.353 --> 10:45.287
You see, I'm still
a little young.

10:46.356 --> 10:50.424
I'd like to show you the house,
if you would like to see it.

10:50.426 --> 10:52.592
That would be very nice.

10:52.594 --> 10:54.827
This is the living room,
of course.

10:54.829 --> 10:58.497
Would you like to see my room?
Yes, I would. Very much.

10:58.499 --> 11:00.765
This way, please.

11:00.767 --> 11:05.870
And this is where you sit quietly
while he does his thinking.

11:05.872 --> 11:08.205
Yes.

11:08.574 --> 11:11.541
What do you do? Well,
sometimes I think.

11:11.543 --> 11:13.609
And then I'm training Theodore.
That's Theodore.

11:13.611 --> 11:18.513
It's a kind of experiment to determine his
capacity for the association of ideas.

11:18.515 --> 11:21.983
I tie his food on the string to
see how long it will take him...

11:21.985 --> 11:25.286
To learn to ring the bell
when he's hungry.

11:25.288 --> 11:27.955
It's a very little bell,
so it isn't noisy.

11:27.957 --> 11:31.091
It doesn't matter very much
whether he learns to or not...

11:31.093 --> 11:33.693
Because he's really
quite a nice little fish.

11:33.695 --> 11:36.862
Yes. Well, what else
do you like to do?

11:36.864 --> 11:38.296
Don't you ever play games?

11:38.298 --> 11:42.566
Oh, yes. We nearly always do after dinner.
We have a schedule for it.

11:42.568 --> 11:45.069
Sch... oh, yeah. What sort
of games do you play?

11:45.071 --> 11:48.705
Oh, like about what things
are pentamerous. Penta...

11:48.707 --> 11:50.206
oh, how do you play that?

11:50.208 --> 11:53.509
You take turns in finding things
that have five of everything...

11:53.511 --> 11:55.377
Until one of you
can't find any more.

11:55.379 --> 11:59.614
Then he loses. It's part of
the science of numerics.

11:59.616 --> 12:02.116
Oh, what other games
do you play?

12:02.118 --> 12:05.452
Oh, well, there's pyramidology.

12:05.454 --> 12:06.619
Pyramid... "ology."

12:06.621 --> 12:10.289
- Pyramidology. Oh.
- That's the science of the great pyramid.

12:10.291 --> 12:14.726
My father made it up too...
the game, I mean. Here it is.

12:14.728 --> 12:16.427
Excuse me.

12:16.429 --> 12:19.430
It was built
in the year 3234 b.C.,

12:19.432 --> 12:21.064
and it's very scientific.

12:21.066 --> 12:23.833
It was built in direct
relationship to the stars,

12:23.835 --> 12:25.668
so it has an
astronomical significance.

12:25.670 --> 12:28.704
It's the only known architectural
example of squaring the circle.

12:28.706 --> 12:33.075
That is, the area of the base is
exactly equal to that of a circle,

12:33.077 --> 12:36.011
with the height of the
structure as its radius.

12:36.013 --> 12:38.546
It has the most wonderful
maths in it.

12:38.548 --> 12:41.916
I'm sure it must be great fun. It is.
I have the most fun...

12:41.918 --> 12:45.386
Elspeth, what have you done
with Mr. Scott there?

12:45.388 --> 12:47.888
We're just coming, father.
We'd better go now.

12:47.890 --> 12:50.557
He may be looking for
something like the corkscrew,

12:50.559 --> 12:54.494
and he really isn't very good
at finding things.

12:55.029 --> 12:57.929
Oh, here. I'll get that out of your way.
Oh, no, don't...

12:57.931 --> 13:00.998
I'm afraid it's become
a little cluttered in here.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.968
Oh, why didn't I see that?
I think I'd better leave this.

13:04.970 --> 13:08.805
This is some correspondence I've
been having with tanggye, a Tibetan,

13:08.807 --> 13:11.440
and the abbe delville
in louvain.

13:11.442 --> 13:13.575
It's on the theory of numbers.

13:13.577 --> 13:15.276
In 1742, goldbach postulated...

13:15.278 --> 13:20.014
That every positive, even
integer is a sum of two primes.

13:20.016 --> 13:22.950
It's been verified to 10,000,
but never proved.

13:22.952 --> 13:26.320
We're trying to prove it. Yes, I'd
want to know where to find that.

13:26.322 --> 13:30.290
By all means. It sounds interesting,
but isn't it a little pointless?

13:30.292 --> 13:34.961
Quite. That's the beauty of it.
Here's something very interesting.

13:34.963 --> 13:39.598
This is rutherford.
Yes, I wanted to finish this.

13:39.600 --> 13:44.536
Yes. He identifies the ten lost
tribes with the scythians.

13:44.538 --> 13:48.339
Quite conclusively too. Nice
to read aloud to elspeth.

13:48.341 --> 13:50.974
Oh, yes, I do. Yes.

13:50.976 --> 13:53.209
Light alloy structures
and hysteresis.

13:53.211 --> 13:56.979
You know where that goes, dear.
And this one.

13:56.981 --> 13:59.514
Oh. Oh, I...

14:04.087 --> 14:07.388
yeah.

14:15.398 --> 14:19.733
One of the more difficult of the
sciences, I should imagine.

14:19.735 --> 14:22.902
Hmm? What's that?
Oh. Oh, yes, yes.

14:22.904 --> 14:24.904
You know, I didn't find
that very satisfactory.

14:24.906 --> 14:29.375
They seem to have such different problems with
their children than I've ever had with elspeth.

14:29.377 --> 14:32.344
You haven't found parenthood very
difficult then? Not at all, really.

14:32.346 --> 14:35.980
Of course, I've been very systematic
about it. I laid out a schedule.

14:35.982 --> 14:38.349
So much work, so much
sleep, so much play.

14:38.351 --> 14:41.752
Pyramidology.
Pyramid... yes, yes.

14:41.754 --> 14:43.687
What's been your
experience in holidays?

14:43.689 --> 14:47.891
I mean, do you send her away where
she can be with other children?

14:47.893 --> 14:49.859
Do you have any children,
Mr. Scott?

14:49.861 --> 14:52.595
No, but I hope to.
But I'd value your opinion.

14:52.597 --> 14:57.032
I used to send her away with other
children, but I don't do that anymore.

14:57.034 --> 14:59.667
She never seemed to
like it very much anyway.

14:59.669 --> 15:03.237
I think perhaps that was because
the other children's minds...

15:03.239 --> 15:06.206
Weren't well enough
organized to interest her.

15:06.208 --> 15:08.274
She's really much happier here.

15:08.276 --> 15:10.776
She's quite good
at being by herself.

15:10.778 --> 15:12.511
Her... her mind...

15:12.513 --> 15:17.015
Is really developing quite
remarkably, Mr. Scott.

15:17.951 --> 15:21.619
I think she'll be
a very fine woman.

15:21.621 --> 15:24.822
Yes. I'm sure she will be.

15:26.325 --> 15:29.993
Well, I'd be... better
be getting along. Oh?

15:29.995 --> 15:32.095
I'll look in at your office
in a few days' time.

15:32.097 --> 15:35.798
I'd like to hear more about that experiment
of yours... about the tail falling off.

15:35.800 --> 15:38.600
What did you want to know about it?
Just a little more detail.

15:38.602 --> 15:42.837
When you expect failure to occur...
I probably have that here.

15:42.839 --> 15:45.773
I think that
it's here someplace.

15:45.775 --> 15:48.709
I think... here it is.

15:48.711 --> 15:54.114
Yes. 2.76 times "k" over
"I." That's the time factor.

15:54.116 --> 15:56.616
It's in b.T.I. Units, of course.

15:56.618 --> 15:59.518
That's, let's see...

15:59.520 --> 16:02.954
that's... 1,440.

16:02.956 --> 16:04.755
1,440 what? Hours.

16:04.757 --> 16:08.959
You don't mean you expect the reindeer
tail to fall off in 1,400 hours?

16:08.961 --> 16:10.093
No, no. 1,440.

16:10.095 --> 16:13.463
But, Mr. honey, a lot of aircraft
have flown many millions of Miles...

16:13.465 --> 16:15.865
Without the tails coming off any
of them because of vibration...

16:15.867 --> 16:21.437
Mr. Scott, you asked me for the evaluation
in time of my "u" subscript "m" symbol.

16:21.439 --> 16:24.339
The mathematical answer is
1,440 hours to failure...

16:24.341 --> 16:28.543
For the specific tail plane under test
on which my calculations are based.

16:28.545 --> 16:30.244
Now, how long has
your test been running?

16:30.246 --> 16:34.181
832 hours, 14 minutes and seven
seconds, as of shutdown tonight.

16:34.183 --> 16:36.950
They don't allow me to run it
more than eight hours a day.

16:36.952 --> 16:40.086
The people in the neighborhood
complain about the racket at night.

16:40.088 --> 16:43.055
Yes, but you know, of course, that
an aircraft in commercial service...

16:43.057 --> 16:45.357
Is likely to pile up flying hours
faster than your experiment.

16:45.359 --> 16:48.993
That's probably quite true. Then why
didn't you insist on a 24-hour basis?

16:48.995 --> 16:53.497
I did insist on it originally, but
they decided to do it for eight hours.

16:53.499 --> 16:56.633
Yes, but you hadn't given
them your 1,440 hour figure.

16:56.635 --> 17:00.536
Well, I never include detail
on my preliminary report.

17:00.538 --> 17:02.404
Science is in no hurry,
Mr. Scott.

17:02.406 --> 17:06.608
I'm working on a principle, which, if
I'm correct, will be true for all time.

17:06.609 --> 17:11.412
But whether I reach it a day or so
later or earlier is not important.

17:11.414 --> 17:16.282
But it might be important for the 50 or so people
who take off in these reindeers every day.

17:16.285 --> 17:21.288
You don't understand. I'm a scientist,
and science is very exacting.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.690
It requires the utmost
concentration.

17:23.692 --> 17:25.590
I can't be concerned
about people.

17:25.593 --> 17:29.795
I... why, if a doctor is trying
to find out a cure for a disease,

17:29.797 --> 17:35.000
what would happen if he let himself be upset
about everybody that got sick and died?

17:35.002 --> 17:37.102
He'd never get
any work done at all.

17:37.104 --> 17:39.170
People must be
someone else's concern.

17:39.172 --> 17:41.472
I can't let it be mine, Mr.
Scott. But...

17:41.474 --> 17:44.074
you can find my preliminary
report in the files,

17:44.076 --> 17:47.811
and I... I don't wish to add anything
more to it at the present time.

17:47.813 --> 17:53.683
If you'll excuse me, I think... I
think I'd better be getting home.

17:58.089 --> 18:00.389
Father.

18:02.226 --> 18:04.626
Oh.

18:05.061 --> 18:07.361
It's very easy to do, you know.

18:07.363 --> 18:10.030
Well, good-bye, elspeth.
Good-bye, Mr. Scott.

18:10.032 --> 18:12.599
Good-bye, Mr. honey.

18:36.724 --> 18:39.958
Excuse me, please, gentlemen.

18:39.960 --> 18:41.993
Rub her down, ned.

18:41.995 --> 18:46.630
Don't give her any water
till she stops sweating.

18:46.632 --> 18:48.698
Scotty! No!

18:48.700 --> 18:51.267
What are you doing here?
Ah, bill, hello.

18:51.269 --> 18:54.003
I've been watching that plane. I
guessed it was you. How are you?

18:54.005 --> 18:57.573
What are you doing here? Have you
come here for a job? No, I got one.

18:57.575 --> 19:00.676
You have? That calls for a drink.
Well, it's a little early.

19:00.678 --> 19:03.745
Rosie? Customers. What are
you gonna fly, Scotty?

19:03.747 --> 19:06.414
No more flying. Matrimony set in.
Grounded, eh?

19:06.416 --> 19:08.883
How'd it happen? Or perhaps
you'd sooner not talk about it.

19:08.885 --> 19:12.987
You wait till you see her. Really? I'm
glad to see you can take it so well.

19:12.989 --> 19:15.589
Rosie. Scotty, meet Rosie.
She's a spy.

19:15.591 --> 19:19.359
Wait till you see her bedroom. It's
absolutely papered in blueprints, isn't it?

19:19.361 --> 19:21.928
- Oh, Mr. penworthy.
- "Oh, Mr. penworthy."

19:21.930 --> 19:24.030
Two large scotches, please.
Yes, sir.

19:24.032 --> 19:26.298
What is your job, Scotty?
Head of metallurgy.

19:26.300 --> 19:27.966
Don't tell me you're
polishing your pants.

19:27.968 --> 19:30.535
Don't tell me you're one of those
crawling little desk blokes.

19:30.537 --> 19:33.070
Always was, pen. Went back
to it when I got out.

19:33.072 --> 19:37.407
This is vodka.
Oh, Mr. penworthy!

19:37.409 --> 19:40.109
Well, off we go. Off we go.

19:40.644 --> 19:43.211
Don't you like desk blokes, bill?
Listen, Scotty.

19:43.213 --> 19:46.013
Pilots and desks, dogs and cats...
natural enemies.

19:46.015 --> 19:49.149
They've got one theme song...
you can laugh. "Pilot's error."

19:49.151 --> 19:54.087
Anything goes wrong with their calculations
and there's a smashup, pilot's error.

19:54.089 --> 19:57.557
Rosie. You remember Harry ward?
Yes, I do.

19:57.559 --> 19:58.824
Look what they did to him.

19:58.826 --> 20:02.928
He was piloting that reindeer when it flew
into the hill at labrador a couple months ago.

20:02.930 --> 20:07.732
All in little pieces. Nothing to go on.
Pilot dead, so... pilot's error.

20:07.734 --> 20:09.867
You don't think
it was pilot's error.

20:09.869 --> 20:12.202
With Harry ward, Scotty?
You can't be serious.

20:12.204 --> 20:15.004
They said he was dropping off
altitude in an overcast.

20:15.006 --> 20:17.973
He wouldn't do a crazy thing
like that if he tried.

20:17.975 --> 20:22.577
Rosie! If you can tear yourself
away from the salt mines...

20:22.579 --> 20:26.080
We would like
a couple of "wodkas."

20:26.082 --> 20:27.414
Oh, Mr. penworthy!

20:27.416 --> 20:31.351
Seven to 10 degrees angle of descent,
motors full on when he hit the hill.

20:31.353 --> 20:34.253
Obviously he was in control. Dropping
off altitude in the overcast.

20:34.255 --> 20:36.421
Pilot's error. He didn't
reckon on that hill.

20:36.423 --> 20:38.322
Do you know how many hours
it had flown, with tests?

20:38.324 --> 20:41.992
How many hours it had flown, with tests.
Yes, I can tell you that. Certainly.

20:41.994 --> 20:46.730
Just one minute. They flew a lot of
tests, simulated flights in weather.

20:46.732 --> 20:52.802
Uh, total number of flying hours
before estimated time of crash:

20:52.804 --> 20:55.437
1,407.

20:55.439 --> 20:58.173
1,407? That's right.

20:58.175 --> 21:00.208
Have you any photographs
of the wreckage?

21:00.210 --> 21:04.045
How many would you like to see? We
cover everything here, Mr. Scott.

21:04.047 --> 21:06.847
We leave nothing out,
I assure you.

21:06.849 --> 21:10.150
Photographs of wreckage.

21:10.152 --> 21:13.653
Any particular part of the wreck?
Yes, the tail plane.

21:13.655 --> 21:17.690
Hmm. I want to see a
photograph of the tail plane.

21:17.692 --> 21:20.726
Yes, I remember now. They
didn't find the tail plane.

21:20.728 --> 21:22.527
Nothing unusual in that,
I assure you.

21:22.529 --> 21:24.862
The plane turned over as it
hit the hill, caught fire.

21:24.864 --> 21:28.365
Wreckage spread all over the place. Thick
undergrowth. You can't see 10 feet.

21:28.367 --> 21:31.868
The investigation... thanks very much.
I'm much obliged.

21:31.870 --> 21:34.303
All right. We send
someone to labrador,

21:34.305 --> 21:37.706
comb through that godforsaken country
for a section of the tail spar...

21:37.708 --> 21:41.376
And take a fine hiding from the taxpayers
when we find there's nothing to it.

21:41.378 --> 21:47.014
All the ruddy decisions to make and
never one you can be sure about.

21:47.016 --> 21:48.682
One thing you do know:

21:48.684 --> 21:51.584
A boffin has to be a bit
balmy to be a boffin.

21:51.586 --> 21:55.721
The line between genius and being
just plain crackers is so thin,

21:55.723 --> 21:59.891
you never know which side you're on,
nor when they've crossed it either.

21:59.893 --> 22:02.560
Tchaikovsky, I'm told, one day
began to eat raw goldfish.

22:02.562 --> 22:06.564
And molière discovered suddenly that he
was better off standing on his head.

22:06.566 --> 22:08.065
Oh, we've had it here too.

22:08.067 --> 22:12.169
A fine time all the papers had when one of our
boffins started pinching girls in the park.

22:12.171 --> 22:17.340
And now our Mr. honey informs us that reindeers
will fall apart after 1,400 hours...

22:17.342 --> 22:19.475
And holds the time figure
out on us.

22:19.477 --> 22:21.076
If I did things like that,
they'd lock me up.

22:21.078 --> 22:25.914
How long before this infernal machine of his is
due to prove something, one way or the other?

22:25.916 --> 22:29.384
Weeks yet, sir. Get it on
a 24-hour basis today.

22:29.386 --> 22:32.420
Better get someone to handle the
complaints when they start coming in too.

22:32.422 --> 22:35.723
Very good, sir. How many hours have
the other reindeers in flight done?

22:35.725 --> 22:38.625
Not nearly as many, sir. The one
in labrador was the prototype.

22:38.627 --> 22:40.827
It did all the tests. That's
why it's got so many hours.

22:40.829 --> 22:45.198
The others were delivered in a group to the
airlines just before they went into service.

22:45.200 --> 22:46.732
They can't have done
more than 500.

22:46.734 --> 22:48.066
That's the best news
I've had today.

22:48.068 --> 22:51.803
I don't want the job of asking the airline
to ground their nice, new fleet...

22:51.805 --> 22:54.505
With no more to go on
than what Mr. honey says.

22:54.507 --> 22:56.406
Well, that's it.
Oh, wait a minute.

22:56.408 --> 22:59.676
You know who we're sending
to labrador, don't you?

22:59.678 --> 23:01.277
That's right.
Mr. Theodore honey.

23:01.279 --> 23:05.214
He's the one who started all this. Maybe
a good, hard climb will do him good.

23:05.216 --> 23:09.785
Still, he knows what he's looking for better
than anyone. Get him started soon as you can.

23:09.787 --> 23:11.787
I'll give him the good
news right away, sir.

23:11.789 --> 23:16.024
Passengers for flight 26
for gander and Montreal:

23:16.026 --> 23:18.960
Will you please have
your embarkation slips ready...

23:18.962 --> 23:21.896
And proceed to the exit door
for boarding the aircraft?

23:21.898 --> 23:25.933
That it? Yes. You'll have
to go through that door.

23:26.635 --> 23:29.369
Every stitch he has in the
world is in that bag.

23:29.371 --> 23:32.271
You can't say he squanders
what he makes on himself.

23:32.273 --> 23:34.006
Well... have a good trip, Mr.
Honey.

23:34.008 --> 23:36.908
Don't worry. We'll look after elspeth.
That's very kind of you.

23:36.910 --> 23:38.843
They'll look after you, dear.
Yes, I know.

23:38.845 --> 23:41.645
Have you got your sandwich? Oh, yes.
Yes, yes, I have.

23:41.647 --> 23:45.815
Tomato, cheese,
and there was some nice fish.

23:47.084 --> 23:50.819
Good-bye, daddy. Good-bye, dear.

23:52.489 --> 23:56.991
I'm afraid I didn't
bring a handkerchief.

23:56.993 --> 24:01.161
I'm sorry. We were in
such a hurry packing.

24:02.797 --> 24:05.264
Mr. and Mrs. brook holter?
That's right.

24:05.266 --> 24:06.965
Thank you. Come along.

24:06.967 --> 24:10.068
Your name, please, sir?
Uh, honey. Theodore honey.

24:10.070 --> 24:12.904
And your embarkation
slip, please?

24:17.010 --> 24:19.310
Miss, uh, teasdale.

24:19.312 --> 24:22.079
Oh, yes. Miss teasdale.

24:22.081 --> 24:23.947
Uh, uh...

24:23.949 --> 24:27.183
thank you, sir. Oh.

24:47.605 --> 24:50.072
Thank you.

24:55.179 --> 24:59.080
Fasten your safety belts. No
smoking, sir, until we take off.

24:59.082 --> 25:01.615
No smoking. I'm so sorry.

25:01.617 --> 25:03.917
Fasten your safety belts.

25:03.919 --> 25:09.155
Would you like to take your coat off, sir?
You'll be more comfortable.

25:09.157 --> 25:10.923
That's right.

25:10.925 --> 25:15.494
We haven't many passengers on this trip,
so you can use this seat for your things.

25:15.496 --> 25:18.063
Oh, thank you. Fasten
your safety belt, please.

25:18.065 --> 25:20.165
Pardon?
I'll just help you do it.

25:20.167 --> 25:23.334
That's it.
Don't want you to fall out.

25:23.336 --> 25:29.039
- All right now?
- Yes, thank you. You're very kind.

25:31.109 --> 25:34.777
I'll be back after we take off
to help you get out of that.

25:34.779 --> 25:37.546
Thank you.

26:23.660 --> 26:27.328
May I have your... may I
have your attention, please?

26:27.330 --> 26:30.564
You may unfasten your seat belts
now and smoke, if you like.

26:30.566 --> 26:33.700
My name is Marjorie corder.
This is Peggy Miller.

26:33.702 --> 26:37.470
We're here to do anything we can to make
your trip pleasant and comfortable.

26:37.472 --> 26:41.140
We'll be glad to give you refreshments
and drinks quite free of charge...

26:41.142 --> 26:44.943
And although we both might regret it
personally, no tipping is permitted.

26:44.945 --> 26:49.447
Thank you, and we're glad
to have you aboard.

26:51.617 --> 26:54.484
Here you are, miss teasdale.
Thank you.

26:54.486 --> 26:58.187
Anything we can do for you?
No. Thank you very much.

26:59.490 --> 27:01.656
Don't you want to
get rid of that now?

27:01.658 --> 27:04.191
Might as well
make yourself comfortable.

27:04.193 --> 27:05.959
Here's the button
to adjust your seat.

27:05.961 --> 27:08.428
Here's the switch for your
reading light, when you want it.

27:08.430 --> 27:12.665
We'll serve dinner soon, but maybe
you'd like some sandwiches and coffee?

27:12.667 --> 27:15.601
Well, I... I... we have
milk too, if you'd rather.

27:15.603 --> 27:19.371
I think a little coffee would be nice.
I brought some sandwiches.

27:19.373 --> 27:21.940
My daughter made them.
Her name's elspeth. Oh.

27:21.942 --> 27:25.143
Well, now, they're probably
much better than ours then.

27:25.145 --> 27:28.279
You sure you didn't bring
your own coffee? No.

27:28.281 --> 27:30.414
I'll get you some. Uh, miss...

27:30.416 --> 27:34.284
miss, weren't you...
isn't that Monica teasdale?

27:34.286 --> 27:37.420
That-that one you were just talking to?
Yes, it is.

27:37.422 --> 27:41.223
She's crossed with us often. A
great many of the film stars do.

27:41.225 --> 27:42.824
Oh? Are you a fan of hers?

27:42.826 --> 27:46.794
I didn't mean... I never go to
films, really, not since...

27:46.796 --> 27:48.529
I... I haven't gone in years.

27:48.531 --> 27:50.998
Would you like me to take
over your autograph book?

27:51.000 --> 27:56.069
Oh, no, no. I don't even have one.
I wouldn't want to trouble her.

27:56.071 --> 28:00.473
Oh, all right. I'll be
back with your coffee.

28:07.515 --> 28:09.515
Oop! Oh, excuse me.

28:09.517 --> 28:13.619
Didn't mean to wish the baby on you, but
I've got one making his first trip.

28:13.621 --> 28:16.321
Sometimes they're worse.
Brought his own sandwiches.

28:16.323 --> 28:18.589
Hey, the skipper can't find
his cloud glasses.

28:18.591 --> 28:21.959
He thinks he may have dropped them in here.
Have a look around for them.

28:21.961 --> 28:25.862
He's quite a bit worried. Almost ran
into a big one. Oh, no, you don't.

28:25.864 --> 28:27.563
No new-girl jokes here.
She's doing fine.

28:27.565 --> 28:32.401
If you've come for coffee, help yourself.
We give pilots service. Copilots, no.

28:32.403 --> 28:34.503
Oh, so you're on her side.

28:34.505 --> 28:36.304
Which one's the boffin?
The boffin?

28:36.306 --> 28:38.806
Scientific bloke from farnborough.
Radio said he was aboard.

28:38.808 --> 28:42.309
Sam thinks he ought to look around.
Courtesy of the trade and all that.

28:42.311 --> 28:45.145
What's his name? Theodore
honey, believe it or not.

28:45.147 --> 28:48.348
Don't tell me where he is.
Two-to-one, I can find him.

28:48.350 --> 28:51.351
I'll take the uncombed bloke
halfway down the starboard side.

28:51.353 --> 28:53.519
Looks as though he
didn't have a mother.

28:53.521 --> 28:57.489
Mr. honey, in 21.
Twen... see? Can't miss.

28:57.491 --> 28:59.290
From farnborough.
I've been a bright Lassie.

28:59.292 --> 29:02.359
I've been talking to him as though
he'd never seen a plane before.

29:02.361 --> 29:05.895
I'll question the master intelligence.
I suppose he speaks our language.

29:05.897 --> 29:08.497
Let him have his coffee first.
All right.

29:08.499 --> 29:11.099
I'll come down for him
when we've hit the step.

29:11.101 --> 29:13.234
We'll only give him
the sixpenny tour.

29:13.236 --> 29:16.837
He may ask a few questions
we can't answer.

29:21.476 --> 29:26.078
Here you are, Mr. honey. No idea
you were an expert on aviation.

29:26.080 --> 29:30.415
I deserve a prize for talking to you
as though you've never flown before.

29:30.417 --> 29:32.116
Well, I never have flown before.

29:32.118 --> 29:35.185
What I know about airplanes
is more when they're in pieces.

29:35.187 --> 29:36.719
Well, you seem to be
quite famous.

29:36.721 --> 29:41.356
Captain Samuelson sent down word he'd like to
show you over the plane... flight deck and all.

29:41.358 --> 29:44.025
They don't do that for everyone.
You're all being very nice...

29:44.027 --> 29:47.395
I think you'd be interested. These new
reindeers are beautifully equipped.

29:47.397 --> 29:50.765
Radar and everything. Is
this a reindeer we're in?

29:50.767 --> 29:54.034
That's right.
A nice, new, shiny one.

29:54.036 --> 29:56.202
I think I'd like to
see it very much.

29:56.204 --> 30:02.141
The copilot will be down for you, but
don't hurry. Enjoy elspeth's sandwiches.

30:14.955 --> 30:17.755
Over here, pressure
analyzer for the cabin.

30:17.757 --> 30:20.958
Now, will you come this way, Mr.
Honey? Thank you, captain.

30:20.960 --> 30:23.860
You're welcome. Will
you step down, please?

30:23.862 --> 30:25.361
The engine instruments are here.

30:25.363 --> 30:28.197
Hank can tell if a cylinder misfires
just once, and which one it is.

30:28.199 --> 30:32.901
I think he can take a reading on whether his
girlfriend's out with someone else or not.

30:32.903 --> 30:34.802
Now, then. Mind the hatch, sir.
Find it, Mac?

30:34.804 --> 30:38.539
Yup. Fuses keep blowing on the
undercarriage safety circuit.

30:38.541 --> 30:40.307
Here we have
the radar screen, sir.

30:40.309 --> 30:43.643
Radio altimeter, radio compass, d.F.
Loop. Excuse me, sir.

30:43.645 --> 30:47.046
The r.C. Repeater, which is duplicated
on the pilot's panel, just in case,

30:47.048 --> 30:50.349
ah, yes. Well, I don't suppose
many things go wrong these days.

30:50.351 --> 30:53.852
Almost never. Won't even use
reconditioned engines in this line.

30:53.854 --> 30:56.955
We get new ones every 600 hours.
Mmm. They're pretty things.

30:56.957 --> 30:58.556
They're really obsolete
though, aren't they?

30:58.558 --> 31:03.427
They're good enough for me. Not a cylinder's
missed a take yet, and this is the third set.

31:03.429 --> 31:07.063
Have me out of a job if they don't
kick up a little something soon.

31:07.065 --> 31:10.066
Well, I wouldn't think
that that would hap...

31:10.068 --> 31:13.369
did you say "the third set"?
That's right.

31:13.371 --> 31:15.371
But I thought the reindeers
were new on this run.

31:15.373 --> 31:17.973
They are, on this run, but this
was one of the first two built.

31:17.975 --> 31:21.676
The builders wanted experience with the ship
before turning the fleet over to this line.

31:21.678 --> 31:25.379
We were loaned out a while on the South
American run. Well, for how long?

31:25.381 --> 31:31.051
Quite a while. Tell me exactly how
many hours this airplane has flown.

31:31.053 --> 31:34.487
Certainly. It's right here.

31:36.257 --> 31:39.725
Now, 1,422 up to takeoff.

31:39.727 --> 31:43.495
Anything else, sir? But...

31:44.865 --> 31:46.264
no, I...

31:46.266 --> 31:51.002
we have dual a.D.F. Indicators...
that's enough.

32:03.916 --> 32:07.751
Well, did you learn
all about airplanes?

32:11.289 --> 32:13.555
Mr. dobson, I must speak
to the captain at once.

32:13.557 --> 32:16.291
Captain Samuelson's very busy, Mr. honey.
If there's something I can do...

32:16.293 --> 32:20.628
please tell the captain I have every reason
to believe this airplane's in serious danger.

32:20.630 --> 32:25.466
I insist on speaking to him, please.
I'll see what I can do.

32:38.948 --> 32:42.749
What's all this about? I understand
you're not very happy about something.

32:42.751 --> 32:46.886
Captain, this airplane and everybody
in it's in very serious danger,

32:46.888 --> 32:48.320
and you must turn back at once.

32:48.322 --> 32:52.691
Um, what sort of danger? I've been
working on a theory on nuclear fission.

32:52.693 --> 32:55.126
I used the tail plane
of a reindeer as a basis.

32:55.128 --> 32:58.229
According to my calculations,
it'll fail in 1,440 hours.

32:58.231 --> 33:02.366
I see, but this is a theory. I've
done a great deal of work on this.

33:02.368 --> 33:06.536
This airplane has flown
1,422 hours as of takeoff.

33:06.538 --> 33:08.371
The tail plane can fail
at any moment.

33:08.373 --> 33:12.341
I don't believe you realize the very strict
procedures under which an airline operates.

33:12.343 --> 33:16.945
Have you ever heard of an airworthiness
certificate? This is something entirely new.

33:16.947 --> 33:19.914
This is... nobody knows anything
about this. Why don't they know?

33:19.916 --> 33:23.918
It would seem very strange if farnborough
wouldn't let us in on a problem like that.

33:23.920 --> 33:26.654
Have they definitely
accepted your theory?

33:26.656 --> 33:29.023
Well, there is no proof, no.
Not the way you mean it.

33:29.025 --> 33:32.893
That's the reason I'm on my way to labrador
right now, to investigate that crash.

33:32.895 --> 33:36.029
Labrador? That airplane
crashed at 1,407 hours...

33:36.031 --> 33:37.463
within hours of my calculations.

33:37.465 --> 33:40.766
Less time than this airplane has flown.
You know the tail group failed?

33:40.768 --> 33:42.734
The tail group wasn't found
with the wreckage.

33:42.736 --> 33:45.269
Every minute that we spend... but
the truth of the matter is...

33:45.271 --> 33:49.339
That apart from the coincidence of the
crash, all of this is just your opinion.

33:49.341 --> 33:53.976
Look. Would you feel happier if we went down
together and had a look at the tail spar?

33:53.978 --> 33:56.878
It won't do any good.
It'll happen very suddenly.

33:56.880 --> 33:59.881
One moment the tail plane spar
will be perfectly normal,

33:59.883 --> 34:04.485
and the next moment the whole
character of the metal will change,

34:04.487 --> 34:07.154
and the tail will break off,
captain, quite suddenly,

34:07.156 --> 34:09.589
and you'll go into a dive
from which you can't recover.

34:09.591 --> 34:12.458
Your only chance, captain,
is to turn back immediately.

34:12.460 --> 34:16.261
You can cut your inboard engines to
break up the vibration frequency,

34:16.263 --> 34:18.429
land at the first
available airport.

34:18.431 --> 34:22.766
If you don't do it, captain, this
airplane's gonna crash into the sea.

34:22.768 --> 34:25.534
We're all going to be killed.

34:29.407 --> 34:31.306
I see.

34:31.308 --> 34:32.907
Tell you what I'll do.

34:32.909 --> 34:35.542
I'll radio back a full report
of all you've told me,

34:35.543 --> 34:37.777
and if London tells me
to turn back, I will.

34:37.779 --> 34:40.880
Meanwhile, I'll cut the inboard
motors, as you suggest.

34:40.882 --> 34:43.716
It'll make us late at gander, but
I'll take that responsibility.

34:43.717 --> 34:48.454
But I warn you, there won't be anyone at
the airport to make a decision like that.

34:48.456 --> 34:53.391
At this time of day, they'll find it
very difficult to find anyone who can.

34:53.393 --> 34:57.496
Very well, captain.
Let's wish ourselves luck.

35:08.074 --> 35:15.079
Well, I've heard a good many strange things
in my life, but that's way ahead by a mile.

35:18.484 --> 35:20.617
Well, you better put it on
the horn to London, Peter.

35:20.619 --> 35:24.020
I wouldn't miss unloading a report like
that on the boys for half my pension.

35:24.022 --> 35:30.393
Right. Well, it'll give them something
to think about anyway. Here it goes.

35:30.395 --> 35:32.962
London radio from flight 26.

35:32.964 --> 35:35.664
London radio from flight 26.
Okay, Sam?

35:35.666 --> 35:41.202
Yeah. London radio from flight 26.
Over.

35:51.614 --> 35:54.281
Hey, Marjorie. I've got news for you.
Your boffin's crackers.

35:54.283 --> 35:57.350
What's the matter? Did he ask you
some questions you couldn't answer?

35:57.352 --> 36:00.086
Clean off his rocker. He says
the tail's gonna fall off.

36:00.088 --> 36:01.887
He didn't. He did,
and with variations.

36:01.889 --> 36:05.624
Sam thinks you oughta keep an eye
on him in case he gets violent.

36:05.626 --> 36:07.192
He didn't seem to be like that.

36:07.194 --> 36:09.761
He thinks we ought to stop it vibrating.
Ruddy little squirt.

36:09.763 --> 36:14.699
I'd like to vibrate him. Sam says
ring through if you need help.

37:05.551 --> 37:10.020
May I look in here for just a moment?
Go ahead.

37:14.226 --> 37:18.294
Is there anything I
can do to help? No.

37:21.499 --> 37:24.099
Thank you very much.

37:29.506 --> 37:31.539
What... what...
what's all that about?

37:31.541 --> 37:35.809
Liked the tour they gave him, I
suppose, so he's having one of his own.

37:35.811 --> 37:38.745
Coffee, Sam? No. No, thanks.
Not just now.

37:38.747 --> 37:43.783
I, um, want to get some
cigarettes from my bag.

38:21.556 --> 38:24.723
Miss teasdale? Miss teasdale?

38:25.525 --> 38:26.624
Huh?

38:26.626 --> 38:30.027
You don't know me, but honey's my name.
Theodore honey.

38:30.029 --> 38:34.398
I just couldn't help...
I'd like to talk to you.

38:34.400 --> 38:36.366
Of course. I'd be very pleased.

38:36.368 --> 38:41.104
I've always... Mrs. honey
and I, we've always...

38:41.106 --> 38:43.406
I've always felt
I owed you a great deal.

38:43.408 --> 38:45.708
Your pictures meant a lot
to my wife and I...

38:45.710 --> 38:49.344
that's why I want to talk to you.
You're very kind.

38:49.346 --> 38:52.947
It's, uh... may I? Certainly.

38:52.949 --> 38:55.749
It... it's about the condition
of this airplane.

38:55.751 --> 38:57.684
I'm afraid we're in
very serious danger.

38:57.686 --> 39:01.788
I... I'm rather afraid the tail
may drop off at any moment.

39:01.790 --> 39:04.423
Now, when that happens, there may be...
is that so?

39:04.425 --> 39:07.092
Yes. When that happens,
there may be a little time,

39:07.094 --> 39:09.127
so go to the men's room
and sit on the floor.

39:09.129 --> 39:14.065
The partition is very rigid because the stove
is bolted to the floor on the other side.

39:14.067 --> 39:16.067
Now, if you survive
the first impact,

39:16.069 --> 39:19.070
try to get out of the escape
hatch and get to a life raft.

39:19.072 --> 39:23.040
They may pick you up when they
search for us in the morning.

39:23.042 --> 39:25.909
That's certainly
very interesting.

39:25.911 --> 39:28.311
Go to the men's room. Yes.

39:28.313 --> 39:30.846
Sit on the floor.

39:34.817 --> 39:36.149
Oh, no.

39:36.151 --> 39:38.050
According to these calculations...
look, Mr. honey.

39:38.052 --> 39:42.921
I'm afraid miss teasdale's very tired. We
really ought to let her rest for a while.

39:42.923 --> 39:46.557
Yes, I'm a little tired, but
thank you very much, Mr. honey.

39:46.559 --> 39:49.860
Please, Mr. honey. I'm sorry.
I was only trying to help.

39:49.862 --> 39:53.797
I'm sure you were.
Some other time perhaps.

39:56.935 --> 39:59.502
You shouldn't have done that, Mr. honey.
It's quite clear I shouldn't.

39:59.504 --> 40:03.239
I'm sure you don't want to alarm people.
You might even cause a panic.

40:03.241 --> 40:07.209
You won't do it again, will you?
No, no. I won't do it again.

40:07.211 --> 40:11.513
I know you're very worried.
Isn't there anything I can do?

40:11.515 --> 40:13.748
You know all about this, don't you?
Yes.

40:13.750 --> 40:18.385
The pilot had to tell me. You've been very
kind to me. I'm sorry I made trouble.

40:18.387 --> 40:22.655
Oh, no, Mr. honey. You really didn't
make any trouble. It's only that...

40:22.657 --> 40:26.792
I think I'd like to tell you what I
was trying to tell miss teasdale.

40:26.794 --> 40:29.461
Well, do, if it'll make
you feel any better.

40:29.463 --> 40:33.198
Well, I think I know more about this
than either you or the captain.

40:33.200 --> 40:34.732
I think I know
what's going to happen.

40:34.734 --> 40:39.770
If it does, at this altitude, there'll be less
than three minutes before we hit the water.

40:39.772 --> 40:41.805
Now, there's one place
in this airplane...

40:41.807 --> 40:44.941
Where a person would have
a chance to survive that impact.

40:44.943 --> 40:48.010
Come with me.

40:48.912 --> 40:50.945
Now, at the first sign of
trouble, go in here...

40:50.947 --> 40:54.181
And sit on the floor with your
back against the partition.

40:54.183 --> 40:55.949
See, this parti...
here, I'll show you.

40:55.951 --> 41:00.253
This partition is very rigid, because
the stove here is bolted to the floor.

41:00.255 --> 41:04.457
I've tried to tell miss teasdale that,
because I felt that I owed her something.

41:04.459 --> 41:07.693
But now I want you to know.
I won't talk to anybody else.

41:07.695 --> 41:10.295
It's good of you to have
told me all this, Mr. honey.

41:10.297 --> 41:13.164
No one's worried about me
like that for quite a while.

41:13.166 --> 41:15.966
Yes, but you will remember what
I told you when it happens.

41:15.968 --> 41:17.867
I'll certainly remember.
I can't promise to do it.

41:17.869 --> 41:22.037
I'm one of the crew, and there are quite
a few things to do if anything happened.

41:22.039 --> 41:24.873
But thank you just the same.
Do it if you can, though.

41:24.875 --> 41:27.609
I think we're going to be all right, Mr.
Honey. No.

41:27.611 --> 41:30.712
But in any event, there's
nothing we can do about it.

41:30.714 --> 41:34.348
It's kind of you to worry
about me, but please don't.

41:34.350 --> 41:38.652
Why don't you try and
get some rest instead?

41:38.654 --> 41:41.187
Yes, I'll try.

41:45.593 --> 41:49.895
I think that crisis is over now, miss
teasdale. I don't think it'll happen again.

41:49.897 --> 41:51.396
What's the matter with
that little man?

41:51.398 --> 41:55.299
I think he was just trying to do something
for you. I'm afraid he's got some odd ideas.

41:55.301 --> 41:59.670
He certainly has. He told me to sit
on the floor in the men's room.

41:59.672 --> 42:01.538
If that isn't an odd idea,
I'd like to meet one.

42:01.540 --> 42:05.675
I think he was trying to tell you the best
place to be if there was an accident.

42:05.677 --> 42:09.879
Is that what I ought to do? I think he's
right about it being the safest place.

42:09.881 --> 42:13.015
But if he's right about that, he may
be right about the tail falling off.

42:13.017 --> 42:17.519
Who is he? Just one of the passengers.
Some kind of scientist, I think.

42:17.521 --> 42:19.387
You know, they don't often track.
Oh.

42:19.389 --> 42:24.191
The altitude, miss teasdale, sometimes causes
a nervous state in certain passengers.

42:24.193 --> 42:27.594
I'm sure that it had that effect on Mr.
Honey for a while. But he's quiet now.

42:27.596 --> 42:32.465
That's more than I am. There's about to be another
passenger on this plane in a nervous state.

42:32.467 --> 42:35.901
I assure you, there's nothing to be
alarmed about. Captain Samuelson's...

42:35.903 --> 42:40.739
listen, dear. The scientist says this plane
is going to crash. The captain says it isn't.

42:40.741 --> 42:43.608
Your vote doesn't count, because you
have to string along with the captain.

42:43.610 --> 42:48.012
That leaves it a tie.

42:50.483 --> 42:54.518
What's that? He seems
to be saving fuel.

42:54.520 --> 42:56.553
I imagine... he wouldn't
do that without a reason.

42:56.555 --> 42:59.122
I thought you said he didn't believe it.
All I meant...

42:59.124 --> 43:04.393
just a minute. If I am going to meet my
maker, I would like to know about it.

43:04.395 --> 43:09.498
I'll tell you what you can do. You can get a
cup of coffee. Bring it to me over there.

43:09.500 --> 43:12.567
No, miss teasdale, I've
just got him quiet, please.

43:12.569 --> 43:14.135
Right now
I don't want him quiet.

43:14.137 --> 43:17.338
There are lots of things I want
him to talk about. I wouldn't...

43:17.340 --> 43:18.672
now just go and get the coffee.

43:18.674 --> 43:24.144
Mr. honey, I was only half awake. And I only
half heard what you were trying to tell me.

43:24.146 --> 43:27.514
May I sit down for a minute?
Yes, certainly.

43:27.516 --> 43:28.948
Thank you.

43:28.950 --> 43:30.716
Would you like a cigarette?
No, thank you.

43:30.718 --> 43:34.352
Now, she tells me you're a scientist.
You care for a lozenge?

43:34.354 --> 43:36.287
Lozenge? No, thank you.

43:36.289 --> 43:39.390
Right. Will do. Listening out.

43:39.392 --> 43:42.126
Airport said they can't make
any decision about turning back,

43:42.128 --> 43:43.861
and they've never heard
of any trouble with the tail.

43:43.863 --> 43:47.531
They'll try and contact someone at a
higher level at the airline or ministry,

43:47.533 --> 43:49.199
but it may take some time.

43:49.201 --> 43:51.467
Till then they want you
to use your own judgment.

43:51.469 --> 43:54.102
They also want us to keep an
eye out for a small boat.

43:54.104 --> 43:58.039
Some crackpot trying to sail the
Atlantic single-handed. Fine.

43:58.041 --> 43:59.340
He may be in trouble. Mm-hmm.

43:59.342 --> 44:04.445
Well, if we see him, we'll stop and
ask him what we ought to do about it.

44:09.318 --> 44:13.553
All right, now, I estimate it would
require a speed of 420 Miles an hour...

44:13.555 --> 44:15.054
To bring the forces
into equilibrium.

44:15.056 --> 44:19.758
This could be attained by a downward flight
path of seven degrees below the horizontal.

44:19.760 --> 44:22.060
That angle would keep us
from plunging straight in,

44:22.062 --> 44:25.797
although, at that speed, the
impact would be rather severe.

44:25.799 --> 44:28.633
See? I see.

44:28.968 --> 44:30.334
I don't see at all, of course.

44:30.336 --> 44:34.838
But I do understand that when you think
something out, you don't stop halfway, do you?

44:34.840 --> 44:39.209
But the pilot... he should understand you.
Why doesn't he turn back?

44:39.211 --> 44:40.810
Well, it was rather difficult
for the pilot.

44:40.812 --> 44:45.614
You see, I imagine that all this may sound a
little improbable if you haven't studied it.

44:45.616 --> 44:47.148
Would it help if I
would talk to him?

44:47.150 --> 44:52.419
No. No, I don't think so. I think we're quite
near to the point of no return anyway.

44:52.421 --> 44:58.892
The point of no return? That's where it's
as short to go on as it is to turn back.

44:58.894 --> 45:03.529
Oh. I thought you meant
something else.

45:03.531 --> 45:06.899
Miss teasdale, would you like
your coffee in your own seat?

45:06.901 --> 45:11.603
No, put it over here. Oh, as a matter
of fact, let's go back there...

45:11.605 --> 45:14.472
where we won't wake anybody
no matter how much we talk.

45:14.474 --> 45:17.041
Where I can say my prayers if
I feel like it. All right?

45:17.043 --> 45:21.145
Yes, miss teasdale. Good. We can all
stop worrying who's going to sit where.

45:21.147 --> 45:23.647
Come on, Mr. honey.

45:33.158 --> 45:36.259
That's it. Halfway, just.

45:36.261 --> 45:39.161
Okay.

45:39.163 --> 45:40.629
Oh, Peter. Yes, sir?

45:40.631 --> 45:43.198
If they call you again, tell
them to tell the high-ups...

45:43.200 --> 45:45.700
They needn't bother making a
decision about turning back.

45:45.702 --> 45:48.335
All right, sir.
Next stop, gander.

45:48.337 --> 45:50.603
Right.

45:52.506 --> 45:56.608
I had a canary once,
didn't have any tail.

45:56.610 --> 45:59.510
It flew all right.

46:09.154 --> 46:10.586
Funny.

46:10.588 --> 46:15.257
I would have thought I'd feel quite differently
being right up against it like this.

46:15.259 --> 46:16.591
My mind is going twice as fast,

46:16.593 --> 46:21.996
as though it were trying to catch up with
all the thinking it didn't get around to.

46:21.998 --> 46:23.163
All those people there...

46:23.165 --> 46:29.569
makes you wonder... Which one you would
pick out to save if you were God...

46:29.571 --> 46:33.105
And which one
wouldn't matter much.

46:34.575 --> 46:36.641
What are you thinking?
Oh, I don't know.

46:36.643 --> 46:39.210
I never thought much
about things like that.

46:39.212 --> 46:41.478
No. You didn't have much time.

46:41.480 --> 46:45.048
You were so busy with
your multiplication table.

46:45.050 --> 46:49.385
But you had a chance to play
God for a little while.

46:49.387 --> 46:53.622
Why did you pick me out when
you decided to save someone?

46:53.624 --> 46:55.724
Oh, but you ought to live.

46:55.726 --> 46:59.494
I mean, the work you do,
you should keep on doing it.

46:59.496 --> 47:03.764
Oh, the work. No, I don't
think I'll buy that.

47:03.766 --> 47:07.267
A few cans of celluloid
in a junk heap someday.

47:07.269 --> 47:10.670
Has been fun,
but that's about all.

47:10.672 --> 47:13.572
No, the work you do...
if you could have finished that,

47:13.574 --> 47:17.742
all these people and lots more wouldn't
be in the spot they're in right now.

47:17.744 --> 47:22.146
That's the kind of work
that should be finished.

47:22.148 --> 47:24.681
No. I think I'd pick you.

47:24.683 --> 47:29.018
Well, that's very nice of you
to say that, miss teasdale,

47:29.020 --> 47:31.820
but I think it'll be all
right about the work.

47:31.822 --> 47:36.357
The work will get done. I think
it'll be all right about me.

47:36.359 --> 47:40.361
Haven't you any family? Yes, I have
elspeth. That's my little girl.

47:40.363 --> 47:42.363
Oh, you have a little girl?
Yeah.

47:42.365 --> 47:43.664
That's worth a lot
to come back to.

47:43.666 --> 47:46.767
Oh, yes. Well, I didn't mean
that I wouldn't like to.

47:46.769 --> 47:50.237
We're really very fond
of one another.

47:50.239 --> 47:52.539
What I... what I mea... I-I...

47:52.541 --> 47:58.278
I've been thinking about that.
And I... she's 12 now.

47:58.280 --> 48:00.113
Her character's formed, I think.

48:00.115 --> 48:04.550
Mary did that mostly.
She... that's my wife.

48:04.552 --> 48:08.086
I-I wish it didn't have
to be like that, but I...

48:08.088 --> 48:13.191
she's developed to such a point, I-I...
I think she's gonna be all right.

48:13.193 --> 48:16.627
Of course, I-I've been able
to help in a lot of things.

48:16.629 --> 48:20.831
She's much more soundly developed
than most children her age.

48:20.833 --> 48:25.769
Really has a remarkable
grasp of crystallography.

48:25.771 --> 48:28.271
Well, that's very good,
of course. What is it?

48:28.273 --> 48:32.775
It's quite fundamental. It's always been
odd to me that schools don't teach it.

48:32.777 --> 48:39.047
No I-I've really had to help her in almost
everything she knows worth knowing.

48:39.049 --> 48:41.817
Has she got a compact? A-a what?

48:41.819 --> 48:43.785
A compact. Oh, a compact.

48:43.787 --> 48:46.654
I don't know. Why? Never mind.

48:48.224 --> 48:52.125
That isn't it? Mm-mmm. No.

48:53.928 --> 49:00.332
Some more minutes, and each one is
like kind of a present, isn't it?

49:00.334 --> 49:01.900
Hmm.

49:01.902 --> 49:04.836
You know what I was
thinking about just then?

49:04.838 --> 49:07.638
All the people
who'll come to my funeral.

49:07.640 --> 49:09.673
That'll be quite an occasion.

49:09.675 --> 49:12.942
Do you have a family,
miss teasdale? No.

49:12.944 --> 49:14.944
Not even a husband
at the moment.

49:14.946 --> 49:18.314
But there's my agent.
Oh, he'll be so sad.

49:18.316 --> 49:21.583
He had five more years
to go at 10%.

49:21.585 --> 49:25.320
And then there's loreen Colvin.
Oh, she'll cry the most.

49:25.322 --> 49:26.821
She'll give
a beautiful performance,

49:26.823 --> 49:31.058
and then she'll try to get the part
in the picture I was going to make.

49:31.060 --> 49:34.895
I suppose that's why I don't
feel the way I thought I would.

49:34.897 --> 49:37.163
I would have stopped working
quite a while ago...

49:37.165 --> 49:40.166
If I could have figured out
what to do with myself.

49:40.168 --> 49:43.068
I was married three times,
but it never came to anything.

49:43.070 --> 49:46.571
I wouldn't be surprised
if it was all my fault.

49:46.573 --> 49:49.440
Maybe Providence is trying
to tell me something.

49:49.442 --> 49:55.813
Maybe it took a first-class high dive into
the middle of the Atlantic to make me quit.

49:55.815 --> 49:58.248
But maybe I'd rather
it ended with a big splash.

49:58.250 --> 50:04.587
No, no. You've made people happy
you don't even know about.

50:04.589 --> 50:05.688
Like my wife, Mary.

50:05.690 --> 50:11.293
She took me to see one of your pictures
that last night before the bomb came.

50:11.295 --> 50:14.362
She talked about it
a lot when we got home.

50:14.364 --> 50:18.499
You made that last night
very happy for her.

50:18.501 --> 50:21.368
That's worth doing,
miss teasdale.

50:21.837 --> 50:23.536
You know, when we used to
go to pictures,

50:23.538 --> 50:26.572
we used to walk right out on 'em
when Mary didn't like them.

50:26.574 --> 50:31.209
We never walked out
on one of your pictures.

50:34.314 --> 50:37.114
Mr. honey,
this is not exactly...

50:37.116 --> 50:39.850
The best compliment
I've ever had.

50:39.852 --> 50:43.920
Maybe it's the nicest. That's why
I had to tell you what I did.

50:43.922 --> 50:46.389
I have to do
everything I can for you.

50:46.391 --> 50:49.725
You mean it too, don't you?

50:58.902 --> 51:03.271
You scientists are always so
busy figuring out new things.

51:04.507 --> 51:07.441
Why don't you figure out
a mascara that won't run?

51:07.443 --> 51:12.212
Oh, well, I'm afraid that's
a little out of my field.

51:12.214 --> 51:16.115
Oh, I'll be as good as new
in a minute.

51:16.584 --> 51:19.451
Thanks for holding my hand.

51:27.560 --> 51:32.696
I wouldn't mind seeing something.
I don't care very much what.

51:32.698 --> 51:38.234
Newfoundland ought to be around here
somewhere, if I haven't added wrong.

51:38.236 --> 51:40.269
How late are we?
An hour and 28 minutes.

51:40.271 --> 51:43.505
Well, it's about time I got
them on their feet, isn't it?

51:43.507 --> 51:47.375
Leave 'em alone. This stuff's
got gander airfield closed in.

51:47.377 --> 51:50.177
We may have to sit up here
till it breaks.

51:50.179 --> 51:51.978
Oh, fine.

51:51.980 --> 51:55.381
- Want some coffee?
- No.

52:11.399 --> 52:13.799
We'll start
the inboard motors to land.

52:13.801 --> 52:16.334
Hank, go and feather two and three.
Yes, sir.

52:16.336 --> 52:18.836
How long?
Oh, about half an hour.

52:18.838 --> 52:20.904
I'll get them cracking
back there.

52:20.906 --> 52:23.439
Oh, I'll take that
coffee now. Thanks.

52:23.441 --> 52:25.107
Right. Take it, Sam.

52:25.109 --> 52:28.276
Call gander tower. Tell them
I want the runway cleared.

52:28.278 --> 52:31.412
Tell them I'm coming straight
in on a direct approach. Okay.

52:31.414 --> 52:34.481
They're asking for an emergency landing.
What's up?

52:34.483 --> 52:36.282
I don't know. He said
it was a long story.

52:36.284 --> 52:39.818
Better phone a.O.A. Flight 52
and tell them to keep circling.

52:39.820 --> 52:42.620
I'll look after things
down here.

52:49.328 --> 52:53.396
Good. Hello.

53:01.539 --> 53:04.039
Miss teasdale?

53:04.041 --> 53:07.308
Miss teasdale,
we land in 20 minutes.

53:07.977 --> 53:12.579
Would you like some coffee?
Twenty minutes?

53:12.581 --> 53:15.148
We're that close?

53:15.150 --> 53:20.219
We're still all in one piece.
Yes, it's a lovely, clear night.

53:20.221 --> 53:23.822
So it is. The stars are out.

53:26.359 --> 53:29.960
I'll go back to my seat.

53:31.430 --> 53:34.798
Would you like some coffee, Mr.
Honey? No, thank you.

53:34.800 --> 53:37.500
You did have rather
a lot, didn't you?

53:37.502 --> 53:42.404
I'm sorry you had to be so worried, but
I think we're quite all right now.

53:42.406 --> 53:43.538
We're all very lucky.

53:43.540 --> 53:48.442
You'll go back to your seat and fasten your
safety belt for the landing, won't you?

53:48.444 --> 53:50.844
Yes.

53:53.949 --> 53:57.550
Gear down. Gear down, sir. Watch
the undercarriage switch, sir.

53:57.552 --> 54:00.786
Safety locks are out.

54:11.098 --> 54:13.998
Full flaps. Full flaps, sir.

54:38.557 --> 54:39.622
Reverse pitch.

54:39.624 --> 54:45.294
Looks all right to me. I don't know
what he was in such a hurry about.

55:08.719 --> 55:13.021
Right, sir.

55:23.065 --> 55:24.330
Quite a night, Mr. honey.

55:24.332 --> 55:29.101
I guess you must have multiplied
someplace where you should have divided.

55:30.504 --> 55:32.403
Miss teasdale.
How long do we stay here?

55:32.405 --> 55:36.440
About an hour, I think, sir.
Thank you.

55:37.843 --> 55:42.912
Yes, we can. Right there.
Thank you.

56:04.035 --> 56:08.904
Mr. honey, will you
come with me, please?

56:08.906 --> 56:11.907
Will you come too, miss corder?

56:11.909 --> 56:14.910
Well, what was the trouble?
Any news for me from London?

56:14.912 --> 56:17.045
No, not a thing. No,
that'd make it too easy.

56:17.047 --> 56:19.080
Where's the a.R.B. Inspector?
Well, he's probably asleep.

56:19.082 --> 56:23.350
Get him up. I want that aircraft inspected
as no aircraft's been inspected in history,

56:23.352 --> 56:25.251
every ruddy inch of her,
down to the last rivet.

56:25.253 --> 56:28.587
Dobson, break it to the passengers
there's going to be a delay.

56:28.589 --> 56:30.622
Aye, aye, sir. Miss corder? Sir?

56:30.624 --> 56:33.057
If, as I expect, this inspection
is satisfactory and we take off,

56:33.059 --> 56:36.160
I'm taking responsibility for refusing
to carry Mr. honey on the flight,

56:36.162 --> 56:38.695
as I consider his presence
an unnecessary hazard.

56:38.697 --> 56:40.797
I'll arrange that all other
flights leaving this airfield...

56:40.799 --> 56:42.632
Are adequately informed about
him before they carry him.

56:42.634 --> 56:46.435
It's your responsibility to see he doesn't
get in touch with any of the passengers.

56:46.437 --> 56:50.872
I don't want them alarmed by what, in my
opinion, are groundless, unnecessary fears.

56:50.874 --> 56:52.940
Got that? Yes, sir.

56:52.942 --> 56:55.309
Right. Let's go.

56:57.680 --> 57:01.081
Well, I feel rather like a policewoman.
Don't like it very much.

57:01.083 --> 57:04.317
Well, I don't want to make any
more trouble for you, miss corder.

57:04.319 --> 57:06.986
Where do you want me to go?
I know an office.

57:06.988 --> 57:10.055
Come on. Let's try and make it the
nicest arrest that's ever happened.

57:10.057 --> 57:14.526
Are we going to leave on time?
We're late already, you know.

57:14.528 --> 57:18.029
There'll be a short delay. The captain
wants an inspection, that's all.

57:18.031 --> 57:19.330
It won't take long. Mr. honey...

57:19.332 --> 57:21.699
they say it'll be two hours,
it means it'll be three hours.

57:21.701 --> 57:24.902
Just once... I'd like to tell somebody
what this is going to cost me.

57:24.904 --> 57:29.373
Some coffee, please. The one I liked best
was the one where you killed your husband.

57:29.375 --> 57:32.509
I thought that was smashing.
Yes, I liked that too.

57:37.315 --> 57:39.181
Well, that's nice
and comfortable.

57:39.183 --> 57:43.018
I'll bring you something to eat, if
you like. Bacon and eggs all right?

57:43.020 --> 57:44.719
Yes, that'd be very nice.

57:44.721 --> 57:46.921
I think it's better that
you stay here, Mr. honey.

57:46.923 --> 57:49.490
Some of the passengers
get very upset about delays.

57:49.492 --> 57:52.759
They might find out it was you and
say things they didn't really mean.

57:52.761 --> 57:58.898
Well, I'll do anything you say, miss
corder. Good. I'll be back in no time.

58:03.704 --> 58:06.037
Sorry.

58:19.183 --> 58:23.485
I brought your bag in from the plane.
You really do travel light, don't you?

58:23.487 --> 58:25.420
Do you think
the captain's going on?

58:25.422 --> 58:27.221
I suppose so, unless
they find something wrong.

58:27.223 --> 58:29.923
Now come on, while it's hot. But
they won't find anything wrong.

58:29.925 --> 58:32.759
I told him that. I wish people
didn't think they knew everything.

58:32.761 --> 58:37.163
You mean, you really believe it's going to
crash whether they find anything or not?

58:37.165 --> 58:38.831
Yes, yes. I do believe that.

58:38.833 --> 58:42.100
Well, I've told him. He'll have
to make his own decision now.

58:42.102 --> 58:45.937
Just one thing I'd like to get clear.
How sure are you about this?

58:45.939 --> 58:48.606
You said it was going to happen
last night, and it didn't.

58:48.608 --> 58:51.675
And you said you really didn't have
any proof. Well, I-I'm quite sure.

58:51.677 --> 58:55.278
I've worked it out through three different
channels, and the results all agree.

58:55.280 --> 58:58.648
Of course, I won't know
until the evidence of my test.

58:58.650 --> 59:04.854
But I-I-I suppose if the captain goes
ahead, that miss teasdale will go too.

59:04.856 --> 59:06.455
I expect she will.

59:06.457 --> 59:10.292
I-I-I think she believed me
for a little time last night.

59:10.294 --> 59:11.660
Then I...
then I don't think she did.

59:11.662 --> 59:15.964
You know, it would be nice if you and
captain Samuelson could argue this out...

59:15.966 --> 59:19.100
And get together on whether
it's going to fall apart or not.

59:19.102 --> 59:25.072
This is getting cold. That plane in
labrador, that was proof in a way.

59:26.175 --> 59:29.075
I suppose there was
a stewardess on that one too.

59:29.077 --> 59:32.545
Yes. Yes, I knew
them both very well.

59:34.248 --> 59:37.482
Couldn't you believe me,
miss corder?

59:37.484 --> 59:40.218
You've been so very kind,
and you...

59:40.220 --> 59:43.754
you ought to live and get
married and bring up a family.

59:43.756 --> 59:45.989
You'd be very good at that.

59:45.991 --> 59:48.424
Well, thank you very much
for that, Mr. honey.

59:48.426 --> 59:52.728
You said that just about as
nicely as anybody could.

59:52.730 --> 59:56.998
You know, I'd almost not go if
it would help you stop worrying,

59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.601
but it's my job, and there's
no way of making sure,

01:00:00.603 --> 01:00:04.371
and I don't think it's right to
walk out on something like that.

01:00:04.373 --> 01:00:05.638
Do you know what I mean?

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:09.208
I think everything will be all right
if captain Samuelson says so.

01:00:09.210 --> 01:00:11.843
He knows a great deal
about aircraft.

01:00:11.845 --> 01:00:16.047
Now why don't you eat that up?
It'll make you feel better.

01:00:18.551 --> 01:00:19.683
All right?

01:00:19.685 --> 01:00:24.087
Attention, please.
Passengers, reindeer flight 26.

01:00:24.089 --> 01:00:28.124
Please be ready to board your plane in
20 minutes for the flight to Montreal.

01:00:28.126 --> 01:00:34.830
Flight 26, please be ready to board
your plane in 20 minutes for Montreal.

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:38.400
Well, I'd better be going.

01:00:38.402 --> 01:00:43.071
I won't lock you in, if you promise not
to speak to any of the passengers.

01:00:43.073 --> 01:00:45.406
I won't.
Well, good-bye, Mr. honey.

01:00:45.408 --> 01:00:51.012
We'll see you in Montreal.
And please, don't worry.

01:01:15.970 --> 01:01:18.103
No danger, of course,
once we're in the air.

01:01:18.105 --> 01:01:21.940
That's okay. Keep a man standing by the
lever here on both taking off and landing,

01:01:21.942 --> 01:01:26.311
so nobody catches a coat on it or anything.
Right. I'll see to that.

01:01:26.313 --> 01:01:29.947
- What are you doing here?
- Captain, I-I just have to...

01:01:29.949 --> 01:01:32.683
well, now that you're here,
I want you to listen.

01:01:32.685 --> 01:01:34.317
I've told the inspector here
all that you told me.

01:01:34.319 --> 01:01:38.988
Now, if you've anything to add, I want to
hear it now, and I want him to hear it.

01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:40.856
No, sir. I-I don't...
I don't have anything to add.

01:01:40.858 --> 01:01:45.894
As London doesn't take your opinion sufficiently
seriously to order this aircraft grounded,

01:01:45.896 --> 01:01:48.529
I'm flying her on to Montreal.

01:01:48.531 --> 01:01:50.330
And I want you to get off
and stay off.

01:01:50.332 --> 01:01:53.232
Captain, you mustn't take off in
this airplane. You can't do it.

01:01:53.234 --> 01:01:55.601
Believe me, mathematics is
a very exact science.

01:01:55.603 --> 01:01:58.270
You explained that already. Captain,
it'll be just like the one in labrador.

01:01:58.272 --> 01:02:01.906
The stewardess, all these people...
you said that the last time.

01:02:01.908 --> 01:02:04.141
Leave that alone, you fool!

01:02:04.143 --> 01:02:08.044
Cut the prop!

01:02:32.101 --> 01:02:36.002
That swine. He wanted it wrecked.
That inhuman swine!

01:02:36.004 --> 01:02:39.472
Cut that out! What'd
you let him loose for?

01:02:39.474 --> 01:02:42.842
Better take him out of this before
the passengers find out he did it.

01:02:42.844 --> 01:02:46.512
You'd better come with me,
Mr. honey.

01:02:49.850 --> 01:02:55.320
It just folded up. It just
folded right up and sat down.

01:03:03.697 --> 01:03:06.264
Oh, there'll really be a delay
for everybody now, won't there?

01:03:06.266 --> 01:03:11.636
I don't think there's any doubt about that.
Tell me why...

01:03:12.605 --> 01:03:14.404
he did do it, didn't he?
Yes, I'm afraid he did.

01:03:14.406 --> 01:03:17.306
If you believe in something, you believe
in doing something about it, don't you?

01:03:17.308 --> 01:03:21.376
Well, they wouldn't listen to me and the lever
was right there, so I just... pulled it.

01:03:21.378 --> 01:03:24.712
That's sticking your neck out pretty far,
if you just thought it was going to crash.

01:03:24.714 --> 01:03:27.815
I tried to get them to ground the airplane.
They wouldn't listen to me.

01:03:27.817 --> 01:03:29.416
The lever was just right
there. So I just...

01:03:29.418 --> 01:03:31.684
you just pulled it. Don't those
things cost an awful lot of money?

01:03:31.686 --> 01:03:36.055
A tremendous amount of money! Oh, this is going
to cause a great deal of trouble, but...

01:03:36.057 --> 01:03:38.757
I should think it might. I-I don't
know what they're going to do.

01:03:38.759 --> 01:03:41.292
I've never had any experience
with anything like this before.

01:03:41.294 --> 01:03:46.497
I should think nobody has. I think
this is a kind of a world's record.

01:03:46.499 --> 01:03:48.966
You didn't do that one for
yourself either, did you?

01:03:48.968 --> 01:03:52.369
You could have been sitting right
here on the ground when we took off.

01:03:52.371 --> 01:03:55.839
Looks to me like this was the men's
room deal multiplied by quite a lot.

01:03:55.841 --> 01:04:00.210
Look, you keep him here. Some of the passengers
won't be too pleased about all this.

01:04:00.212 --> 01:04:03.213
I'd like to find out
what the payoff's going to be.

01:04:03.215 --> 01:04:04.914
Come to think of it,
I think I ought to.

01:04:04.916 --> 01:04:07.850
Well, it's very nice of you not
to be angry about the delay.

01:04:07.852 --> 01:04:13.188
Oh, it's worth it. You don't
meet a world record every day.

01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:20.862
Well, I don't know whether to be glad
or sorry I didn't lock the door.

01:04:20.864 --> 01:04:22.530
It never occurred to me
you'd do anything like that.

01:04:22.532 --> 01:04:27.167
Well, it never occurred to me either! I
suppose the airline will be very angry.

01:04:27.169 --> 01:04:30.036
That, I'm afraid, is probably
quite an understatement.

01:04:30.038 --> 01:04:33.305
I can't imagine what the
establishment will think.

01:04:33.307 --> 01:04:36.708
I suppose I'd better let
them know what I've done.

01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:38.743
I imagine they'll hear about it.
Uh-huh.

01:04:38.745 --> 01:04:43.247
Man kills airplane. There's apt to be
quite a lot in the papers about that.

01:04:43.249 --> 01:04:45.415
Oh, dear. Well, elspeth'll
find out about it.

01:04:45.417 --> 01:04:46.983
I can't imagine
what she'll think either.

01:04:46.985 --> 01:04:51.554
Look, Mr. honey, we'll probably be sent
back to London for reassignment...

01:04:51.556 --> 01:04:53.822
After they've sent another plane
to pick up the passengers.

01:04:53.824 --> 01:04:57.826
Would it help if I went to see your little
girl and told her you were all right?

01:04:57.828 --> 01:05:01.596
Would you do that for me? There's no
telling what she'll hear, is there?

01:05:01.598 --> 01:05:05.766
Well, whatever she hears,
I imagine she'll understand.

01:05:05.768 --> 01:05:09.136
Well, I wish I did.

01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:27.218
I would suggest that
it is the solemn duty...

01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:30.154
For anyone who can find anything
remotely humorous in all this...

01:05:30.156 --> 01:05:31.989
To share it with those of us
who are less fortunate.

01:05:31.991 --> 01:05:36.159
Why, I couldn't help it, sir. Old honey
dropping a reindeer right on its belly.

01:05:36.161 --> 01:05:37.960
It's very funny.
I see your point,

01:05:37.962 --> 01:05:39.594
but I can't precisely
enjoy it at the moment.

01:05:39.596 --> 01:05:45.199
I don't remember another day like it. Half
england's been on the telephone to me today.

01:05:45.201 --> 01:05:46.867
I think if one more person,
friend or enemy,

01:05:46.869 --> 01:05:50.937
calls to ask if I've heard that our Mr.
Honey has wrecked an aircraft at gander...

01:05:50.939 --> 01:05:56.042
By pulling up
the undercart, I'll...

01:05:56.778 --> 01:06:00.513
We'd better sort some kind
of order out of all this.

01:06:01.048 --> 01:06:03.848
The chairman of the airline, sir
David moon, calling you, sir.

01:06:03.850 --> 01:06:05.516
I thought I said
I'd take no more calls today.

01:06:05.518 --> 01:06:09.553
He said I was to take the telephone
to you no matter where you were.

01:06:09.555 --> 01:06:11.888
All right. I'll take it.

01:06:11.890 --> 01:06:14.357
Hello. Yes, yes.
Put him through.

01:06:14.359 --> 01:06:18.160
There are quite a few other calls, sir.
You surprise me.

01:06:18.162 --> 01:06:19.628
Huh, the other half's
getting in fast.

01:06:19.630 --> 01:06:23.999
The minister, the a.R.B., the treasury,
every newspaperman in the empire.

01:06:24.001 --> 01:06:25.700
Hello?

01:06:25.702 --> 01:06:28.002
Oh, hello. Hello, sir David.

01:06:28.004 --> 01:06:31.839
It's nice to hear from you.
Oh, yes. That I very much heard.

01:06:31.841 --> 01:06:33.707
I have no way of knowing what
he could have been thinking of.

01:06:33.709 --> 01:06:38.778
We'll get him back for the inquiry, and then
perhaps when I've talked to him, I could...

01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:40.746
oh, I don't think you could
mean that, sir David.

01:06:40.748 --> 01:06:46.785
No, no. I'm not at all prepared to assume
he's a lunatic. At least, not yet.

01:06:46.787 --> 01:06:47.986
Yes, I quite realize that.

01:06:47.988 --> 01:06:51.823
But I don't think there's anything
to be gained by losing our tempers.

01:06:51.825 --> 01:06:55.293
I want... hello? Hello!

01:06:56.296 --> 01:07:00.097
Where are the papers? I thought
you'd want to see them, sir John.

01:07:00.099 --> 01:07:02.165
I'm not so sure.

01:07:02.167 --> 01:07:04.133
Ah, here we are...
"David and goliath.

01:07:04.135 --> 01:07:07.269
Mr. Theodore honey as David brings
down the reindeer single-handed."

01:07:07.271 --> 01:07:10.238
There was one that called him the
galahad of the airways. This is better.

01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:14.175
Sir David's idea, eloquently put, was there
isn't enough money in the bank of england...

01:07:14.177 --> 01:07:17.077
To pay for the damage done to
themselves and British aviation...

01:07:17.079 --> 01:07:19.746
By the implication of
the safety of their aircraft.

01:07:19.748 --> 01:07:22.982
He did manage to sandwich in they
wouldn't guarantee to bring him back,

01:07:22.984 --> 01:07:24.783
that he refused to allow
any more of their passengers...

01:07:24.785 --> 01:07:28.486
To travel with an irresponsible madman
who went about wrecking airplanes.

01:07:28.488 --> 01:07:31.355
Suggested the r.A.F. Might carry him.
They were equipped to take risks.

01:07:31.357 --> 01:07:33.357
I can lay that on, sir,
if he really means it.

01:07:33.359 --> 01:07:35.092
He means it. We'll have
him back for the inquiry.

01:07:35.094 --> 01:07:38.795
- Miss teasdale is here to see you, sir.
- Teasdale? Who's miss teasdale?

01:07:38.797 --> 01:07:40.630
Miss Monica teasdale,
the film star, sir.

01:07:40.632 --> 01:07:43.432
What's a film star doing here?
Tell her I'm sorry. I can't...

01:07:43.434 --> 01:07:46.601
hand her over to major pearl. She said
she wanted to see you about Mr. honey.

01:07:46.603 --> 01:07:49.837
She crossed on the plane with him
last night. But how can she be here?

01:07:49.839 --> 01:07:51.872
Ask her to wait two minutes.
I'll see her.

01:07:51.874 --> 01:07:54.908
Well, gentlemen,
there's one thing we can settle.

01:07:54.910 --> 01:07:56.376
You must send someone else
off to labrador.

01:07:56.378 --> 01:07:59.712
We mustn't show up at that inquiry without
supporting evidence of some kind.

01:07:59.714 --> 01:08:04.683
But for heaven's sake, send someone who can
keep his mind on what he's trying to do.

01:08:04.685 --> 01:08:05.684
No more boffins.

01:08:05.686 --> 01:08:09.521
It is my opinion, sir John, that even
this trouble should not lead us...

01:08:09.523 --> 01:08:11.923
To saying that all scientists are
foolish men and not to be trusted.

01:08:11.925 --> 01:08:15.426
From what department did the gentleman come
who took a bath in the public fountain...

01:08:15.428 --> 01:08:19.830
And subsequently conceived the brilliant
idea of pinching girls in the park?

01:08:19.832 --> 01:08:21.198
I ask you to remember, sir John,

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:24.100
that the last time we decide not
ever to mention this incident again.

01:08:24.102 --> 01:08:26.402
All right. All right. I think
that's all for today, gentlemen,

01:08:26.404 --> 01:08:29.738
except for finding out what film
stars have to do with all this.

01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:30.572
Johnson? Yes?

01:08:30.573 --> 01:08:32.573
Ask miss teasdale to come in.
Very good, sir.

01:08:32.576 --> 01:08:35.076
Mr. Scott, I'd like you to stay.
Good day, gentlemen.

01:08:35.078 --> 01:08:38.078
Sir John, I assure you...
good night.

01:08:49.892 --> 01:08:53.292
Miss teasdale, sir John.
How do you do, sir John?

01:08:53.295 --> 01:08:55.728
How kind of you to see me.
Not at all, miss teasdale.

01:08:55.729 --> 01:08:57.429
Let me present Mr. Scott.
How do you do?

01:08:57.430 --> 01:09:01.232
You're his boss, aren't you? I've
heard a great deal about you.

01:09:01.234 --> 01:09:02.466
Sit down, please. Thank you.

01:09:02.468 --> 01:09:05.368
Did we hear correctly that you were on
the plane last night with Mr. honey?

01:09:05.370 --> 01:09:07.603
That's right. Well, I don't understand.
How did you get back here?

01:09:07.604 --> 01:09:09.837
There was a plane coming through
headed this way, and I got on it.

01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:13.308
But if you want to know why I'm here,
that would take a lot longer to tell you.

01:09:13.310 --> 01:09:17.045
Did he ask you to give us any message?
No. He doesn't know I'm here.

01:09:17.046 --> 01:09:21.582
If you can give us any idea of what really
happened, we shall be very grateful indeed.

01:09:21.584 --> 01:09:24.350
They were going to take off, although
he told them they shouldn't.

01:09:24.353 --> 01:09:26.886
The lever was right there.
He just pulled it.

01:09:26.888 --> 01:09:28.554
You have never seen such
a commotion in your life.

01:09:28.555 --> 01:09:32.291
I guess a thing like that has never happened
before in the history of the world.

01:09:32.292 --> 01:09:34.792
Fortunately, no. Have you known Mr.
Honey long?

01:09:34.795 --> 01:09:37.194
No. I just met him last night,
right after we took off.

01:09:37.197 --> 01:09:39.263
He came to tell me that he
thought we were in trouble.

01:09:39.265 --> 01:09:42.899
But why should he want to alarm you when
there was nothing you could do about it?

01:09:42.901 --> 01:09:45.434
He thought there was
something I could do.

01:09:45.435 --> 01:09:48.636
He gave me his reasons, and
they were good enough for me.

01:09:48.639 --> 01:09:51.840
Did you believe him? What did he do?
Explain his theory?

01:09:51.841 --> 01:09:53.508
He did. And I believed him.

01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:56.344
Did you understand it?
Not a word.

01:09:56.346 --> 01:09:58.145
Then I don't understand.

01:09:58.147 --> 01:10:01.748
Oh, it isn't so hard, sir John.

01:10:01.750 --> 01:10:03.583
I don't know much
about mathematics,

01:10:03.585 --> 01:10:06.118
but I know when a man knows
what he's talking about.

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:08.253
Have you a light? Oh, of course.

01:10:08.255 --> 01:10:10.888
May I smoke? Certainly.

01:10:11.590 --> 01:10:13.723
I don't understand a thing
about his theory,

01:10:13.725 --> 01:10:16.092
but I've learned
quite a lot about Mr. honey,

01:10:16.094 --> 01:10:19.228
and I know he isn't crazy
like they're saying out there.

01:10:19.230 --> 01:10:23.532
That funny little man is brave
and kind and on the level.

01:10:23.534 --> 01:10:26.067
And he believed
what he was telling me.

01:10:26.069 --> 01:10:28.702
But even I can see
it's going to be awfully easy...

01:10:28.704 --> 01:10:31.571
To settle a lot of things
by throwing him to the wolves,

01:10:31.573 --> 01:10:34.440
to say he's crazy
and let it go at that.

01:10:34.442 --> 01:10:37.943
That's why I wanted to meet
the people he worked for...

01:10:37.945 --> 01:10:41.079
to see if they're going to
stand by him.

01:10:41.081 --> 01:10:42.647
Somebody's got to, you know.

01:10:42.649 --> 01:10:46.450
Miss teasdale, I'd like
to pay you a compliment.

01:10:46.452 --> 01:10:51.188
You believe in things too, and that's
very nice to see. But I have to add this.

01:10:51.190 --> 01:10:53.623
I don't know whether
Mr. honey's right or wrong.

01:10:53.625 --> 01:10:56.158
Neither does Mr. Scott,
any more than you do.

01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:57.392
There's no way of knowing.

01:10:57.394 --> 01:11:02.163
But that certainly doesn't mean we're
going to back up Mr. honey blindly.

01:11:02.165 --> 01:11:04.331
There's a matter called the
truth which has to be served.

01:11:04.333 --> 01:11:06.966
It's a difficult thing, the
truth, in a case like this.

01:11:06.968 --> 01:11:10.669
And the most I can promise you is
we'll do our utmost to get at it.

01:11:10.671 --> 01:11:14.973
And we hope it's going to be
on Mr. honey's side.

01:11:15.909 --> 01:11:19.744
Well, the truth
is a good deal, anyway.

01:11:20.346 --> 01:11:24.915
I don't think there was much need
in my coming, but I'm glad I did.

01:11:25.651 --> 01:11:28.918
Thank you, sir John, for
giving me your time. Good-bye.

01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:30.686
Thank you, miss teasdale.
Good-bye.

01:11:30.688 --> 01:11:34.756
I'll see you to your car.
Thank you.

01:11:40.363 --> 01:11:45.199
He means the trouble is going to
be pretty bad. I'm afraid so.

01:11:45.201 --> 01:11:47.435
Isn't there anything
I could do for Mr. honey?

01:11:47.437 --> 01:11:50.905
Where can I find his little girl? I could
go there and tell her that he's all right.

01:11:50.907 --> 01:11:54.174
Oh, I think that would be very nice.
I'll tell your driver where to go.

01:11:54.176 --> 01:11:57.710
Oh, please don't bother. They'll
tell me at the gate. Oh, all right.

01:11:57.712 --> 01:12:02.414
Bye, Mr. Scott. And thank you.
Good-bye, miss teasdale.

01:12:22.301 --> 01:12:25.568
Mr. honey!

01:12:55.598 --> 01:12:59.232
Mr. honey? Of course I know him.
Where have you put him?

01:12:59.234 --> 01:13:04.036
He seems rather odd, sir John. I
wasn't sure you wished to see him.

01:13:06.106 --> 01:13:10.241
Sir John, I want to protest very strongly.
Why has my work been taken out of my hands?

01:13:10.243 --> 01:13:11.742
Supposing we go somewhere
where we can chat.

01:13:11.744 --> 01:13:15.145
I'm not in the habit of going around
wrecking things. You ought to know that.

01:13:15.147 --> 01:13:19.716
Hold on for a minute, Mr. honey.
Come this way with me.

01:13:19.718 --> 01:13:21.918
Mr. Scott, I must borrow
you for a few minutes.

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:26.222
A friend of yours has arrived.
Hello, Mr. honey.

01:13:26.224 --> 01:13:27.523
Yes. Come this way, Mr. honey.

01:13:27.525 --> 01:13:32.928
So, as far as we're concerned, there's
one decision to be made and one only.

01:13:32.930 --> 01:13:36.131
Whether we should allow the remaining
reindeers to go on flying.

01:13:36.133 --> 01:13:39.467
If they're to be grounded, that
must be done at half your estimate.

01:13:39.469 --> 01:13:41.168
We dare not cut safety
finer than that.

01:13:41.170 --> 01:13:45.505
The inquiry has been deferred until the last
possible moment for making that decision,

01:13:45.507 --> 01:13:50.243
which fortunately gives time enough for
your test to reach the 1,440 mark,

01:13:50.245 --> 01:13:51.444
plus some margin of error.

01:13:51.446 --> 01:13:55.481
That's why it isn't yours anymore, or
anyone else's. Too much depends on it.

01:13:55.483 --> 01:13:59.585
If your test is a success, the airline and
everyone else will be very grateful to you.

01:13:59.587 --> 01:14:05.791
If it isn't, or we don't get supporting
evidence of some kind from labrador, then...

01:14:05.793 --> 01:14:10.162
and this is the difficult part, Mr.
Honey, so I'll put it bluntly.

01:14:10.164 --> 01:14:13.565
Since none of them believe for a
moment the test will succeed,

01:14:13.567 --> 01:14:15.600
they feel it imperative that
they should be prepared...

01:14:15.602 --> 01:14:18.336
To issue as effective and as
sweeping a statement as possible...

01:14:18.338 --> 01:14:22.673
To offset the almost ruinous publicity
that reindeers have received.

01:14:22.675 --> 01:14:26.176
That yours was the act of an
irresponsible, unbalanced mind,

01:14:26.178 --> 01:14:27.744
which they believe to be true.

01:14:27.746 --> 01:14:31.314
And they want the supporting opinion
of qualified psychologists.

01:14:31.316 --> 01:14:37.586
In other words, they wish to test
you as well as the tailpiece.

01:14:38.822 --> 01:14:43.791
To see if I'm insane?
That's right.

01:14:45.261 --> 01:14:48.562
Do you think I'm insane? I don't
think you are, Mr. honey,

01:14:48.564 --> 01:14:52.299
any more than I think you make a habit
of going about wrecking things.

01:14:52.301 --> 01:14:54.067
But there's no way to know that.

01:14:54.069 --> 01:14:56.369
I'd hate to have them look
me over at the moment.

01:14:56.371 --> 01:15:00.506
But just now, I haven't the right
to take anything for granted.

01:15:00.508 --> 01:15:01.673
Please understand this.

01:15:01.675 --> 01:15:06.177
I couldn't refuse without making it
look like a blind defense of my staff.

01:15:06.179 --> 01:15:10.548
But you can refuse if you like.
That's your right.

01:15:11.684 --> 01:15:13.684
No, I won't refuse.

01:15:13.686 --> 01:15:15.519
Let them pry and poke
if they want to.

01:15:15.521 --> 01:15:19.256
Tell them I'll be in my office
if they want to see me.

01:15:19.258 --> 01:15:22.325
What about you, Mr. Scott?
Do you think I'm ins...

01:15:22.327 --> 01:15:27.029
no, there'd be no way for you
to know either, would there?

01:15:41.912 --> 01:15:45.280
Who is it? Who's that?

01:15:45.282 --> 01:15:47.949
Oh, Mr. honey.
Oh, I beg your pardon.

01:15:47.951 --> 01:15:49.583
Mr. honey, it's me,
Marjorie corder.

01:15:49.585 --> 01:15:53.053
We didn't expect you back tonight. I
stayed with elspeth. Somebody had to.

01:15:53.055 --> 01:15:56.489
Well, that's very kind... you must be
tired. Have you had anything to eat?

01:15:56.491 --> 01:15:59.258
I don't... you probably didn't.
I'll get you something.

01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:02.060
We had lobster for supper. Do you
like cold lobster? But I can manage.

01:16:02.062 --> 01:16:07.632
It keeps me in practice. Now, why don't you
go upstairs and take a look at elspeth?

01:16:44.771 --> 01:16:47.671
Well, did you notice anything?
Well, she was asleep.

01:16:47.673 --> 01:16:50.073
Anything different,
I meant, about the house.

01:16:50.075 --> 01:16:53.443
Well, you-you haven't
got your clothes on.

01:16:53.445 --> 01:16:56.045
No, in the room. The curtains.

01:16:56.047 --> 01:17:01.717
Curtains? Why... well,
where did this come from?

01:17:01.719 --> 01:17:04.086
Well, that was a present
from miss teasdale.

01:17:04.088 --> 01:17:06.555
Miss teasdale? What?
Is she here too?

01:17:06.557 --> 01:17:08.089
No, she went to London
for the night.

01:17:08.091 --> 01:17:11.792
She got some lovely things for elspeth's
room too. Why don't you eat your supper?

01:17:11.794 --> 01:17:16.096
Well, what did she want to do a thing like
that for? I think you'd be surprised.

01:17:16.098 --> 01:17:18.465
I imagine you were glad
to see farnborough again.

01:17:18.467 --> 01:17:20.800
Did you stop by the laboratory?
Yes, yes. I looked in.

01:17:20.802 --> 01:17:24.503
Well, you don't seem exactly happy about
that. Was there something wrong there?

01:17:24.505 --> 01:17:27.372
No, no. Yes, yes,
there was something wrong.

01:17:27.374 --> 01:17:31.843
I-I can't expect to get any work done with
people standing around peering at me.

01:17:31.845 --> 01:17:34.011
I-I'm now known as
the galahad of the airways.

01:17:34.013 --> 01:17:40.884
Now, I-I-I heard someone saying, "imagine old
honey collecting a poppy like Monica teasdale."

01:17:40.886 --> 01:17:43.286
Well, I expect they were
just trying to be friendly.

01:17:43.288 --> 01:17:47.657
I thought you were rather a galahad
when you told miss teasdale and me...

01:17:47.659 --> 01:17:49.392
What to do in case
there was an accident.

01:17:49.394 --> 01:17:52.828
It's not such a bad thing to be.
Here. Shall I do that for you?

01:17:52.830 --> 01:17:55.897
No, I can manage here. You
know, it's my fault anyway.

01:17:55.899 --> 01:18:00.234
If you do anything wrong, you have
no one to blame but yourself.

01:18:05.006 --> 01:18:08.674
Just what-what was it that
you thought you did wrong?

01:18:08.676 --> 01:18:10.409
You did think there'd
be a crash, didn't you?

01:18:10.411 --> 01:18:14.546
Yes, but what I should have done is offer my
hypothesis to the captain in an orderly manner...

01:18:14.548 --> 01:18:17.282
And let him make his own
decision, but I didn't do that.

01:18:17.284 --> 01:18:18.783
No, when they wouldn't
listen to me,

01:18:18.785 --> 01:18:22.586
I kept thinking about you, lying dead up there
in labrador, like that other stewardess...

01:18:22.588 --> 01:18:23.520
And miss teasdale,
and all the rest of them.

01:18:23.522 --> 01:18:29.726
I wasn't orderly at all... not at all... and
the lever was right there so I pulled it.

01:18:29.728 --> 01:18:32.795
And that seemed wrong to you?
Of course it seemed wrong!

01:18:32.797 --> 01:18:36.498
How is anybody going to take my work seriously
if I go around doing things like that?

01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:40.068
Do you know that they're saying I'm
crazy now? And I don't blame them!

01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:44.639
You don't mean that if you
had it all to do again,

01:18:44.641 --> 01:18:46.741
you'd just let it
go ahead and crash?

01:18:46.743 --> 01:18:50.911
Well, that's just the point. I'd
probably do the same thing over again.

01:18:51.947 --> 01:18:54.847
I'm evidently quite a weak
character, miss corder.

01:18:54.849 --> 01:18:58.250
The mistake I made
was ever leaving farnborough.

01:18:58.252 --> 01:19:01.119
If I just hadn't left there,
and if this all dies down,

01:19:01.121 --> 01:19:05.656
I swear to you, I'm never going
to leave my laboratory again.

01:19:06.358 --> 01:19:09.125
Well, I think I'm a
little sorry about that.

01:19:09.127 --> 01:19:14.029
I know you have to be a scientist. I
know you have important work to do.

01:19:14.031 --> 01:19:16.765
But you're a person too,
Mr. honey.

01:19:16.767 --> 01:19:19.834
Well, it's evidently quite difficult
to be a person, miss corder.

01:19:19.836 --> 01:19:24.238
Yes, I suppose it is, but...
oh, well, never mind.

01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:27.107
I expect you know what you're doing.
I must clear this up.

01:19:27.109 --> 01:19:29.209
You'd better get some rest.
You'll need it.

01:19:29.211 --> 01:19:33.146
Well, good night, miss corder.
Good night, Mr. honey.

01:19:33.148 --> 01:19:36.549
Well, I better get my things out
of your way. Things? What...

01:19:36.551 --> 01:19:39.618
my clothes and things. I'll
move into elspeth's room.

01:19:39.620 --> 01:19:42.954
Well, uh, why, you mean you've
been staying in my... oh.

01:19:42.956 --> 01:19:46.824
Well, what's the matter? Well, I was
just thinking of you, miss corder.

01:19:46.826 --> 01:19:49.326
Don't you think
people will talk?

01:19:49.328 --> 01:19:50.694
Oh, I see.

01:19:50.696 --> 01:19:53.997
Well, I'm a nurse, you know. You
have to be to be a stewardess.

01:19:53.999 --> 01:19:58.735
Would it make it any better if I
got hold of my nurse's uniform...

01:19:58.737 --> 01:20:00.970
And put it on
for the neighbors to see?

01:20:00.972 --> 01:20:02.504
Well, I suppose that would be...

01:20:02.506 --> 01:20:07.775
well, that's what I'll do then. I'd like to
come back just to see how things turn out.

01:20:07.777 --> 01:20:11.645
Good night, Mr. honey. Yes.

01:20:28.663 --> 01:20:32.731
Well! Who's sick? No one. I...

01:20:32.733 --> 01:20:34.699
we had quite a problem
last night.

01:20:34.701 --> 01:20:36.434
Mr. honey arrived back
in the small hours.

01:20:36.436 --> 01:20:41.305
He was so old-school about us both
staying here. It was very sweet really.

01:20:41.307 --> 01:20:44.775
And this has to do with explaining
the situation to the neighbors.

01:20:44.777 --> 01:20:47.244
I had to run over to guildford
this morning to get it.

01:20:47.246 --> 01:20:50.380
It looks as if I missed something
by going up to London last night.

01:20:50.382 --> 01:20:54.317
Where is he? I suppose he couldn't wait to
get down to farnborough this morning...

01:20:54.319 --> 01:20:58.054
To see his playthings again. Well,
that's exactly what happened.

01:20:58.056 --> 01:20:59.855
I'd like to hear about it.
Some coffee left?

01:20:59.857 --> 01:21:03.825
Why don't you come in there?
Why, what's the matter with...

01:21:03.827 --> 01:21:07.595
oh, you've been busy.
I had nothing else to do.

01:21:07.597 --> 01:21:11.398
It looks as though he wears one suit
and goes to sleep in the other.

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:14.768
I don't know how long it can be since
he bought something for himself.

01:21:14.770 --> 01:21:18.738
I thought you were the one who thought a
man shouldn't have things done for him.

01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:22.575
That goes for his character, but
not necessarily his trousers.

01:21:22.577 --> 01:21:26.445
That's very domestic.
You're full of surprises.

01:21:26.447 --> 01:21:29.815
Tell me something. I've
been thinking about it.

01:21:29.817 --> 01:21:33.385
How would you go about getting him
to make it under his own steam?

01:21:33.387 --> 01:21:35.420
That's what you were holding
out for, as I remember it.

01:21:35.422 --> 01:21:38.589
I don't think that part of it
is really any of my business.

01:21:38.591 --> 01:21:41.925
It's just that... I don't know.
We talked a lot last night,

01:21:41.927 --> 01:21:46.596
and he seemed like a little boy who's
had his first fight and got hurt.

01:21:46.598 --> 01:21:48.464
And so he says,
"I'll never fight again."

01:21:48.466 --> 01:21:51.467
Well, he can't keep on
running back to his laboratory.

01:21:51.469 --> 01:21:53.969
That's all right for the
scientist, but not for him.

01:21:53.971 --> 01:21:56.338
He will get into trouble
if he does that now.

01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:59.541
And I don't think he can
make himself do it, really.

01:21:59.543 --> 01:22:02.710
I think he's better than that.

01:22:03.279 --> 01:22:05.646
You must have talked
quite a bit.

01:22:05.648 --> 01:22:10.350
Funny that a kid like you would bother
to see so much in anybody like him.

01:22:10.352 --> 01:22:14.754
It's not so funny, really. You
get around, being a stewardess.

01:22:14.756 --> 01:22:15.955
That doesn't cover it.

01:22:15.957 --> 01:22:18.590
You've been married, or a lot in
love sometime or other, haven't you?

01:22:18.592 --> 01:22:21.626
I don't think that has anything
to do with it. What was it?

01:22:21.628 --> 01:22:26.764
Oh, you've heard it before. He was shot down
over arnheim. We'd been married a month.

01:22:26.766 --> 01:22:32.402
Sure, that says it. Maybe it says
even more than you think it does.

01:22:32.404 --> 01:22:36.072
Well, this'll take
some thinking about.

01:22:36.074 --> 01:22:39.141
And I'll have time for that. I'm
leaving for California tonight.

01:22:39.143 --> 01:22:42.577
There was a flock of cables at
the Dorchester when I got there.

01:22:42.579 --> 01:22:43.878
The studio wants to get going.

01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:48.082
This is a little sudden, isn't it? What
about all the things you talked about?

01:22:48.084 --> 01:22:50.851
Helping him to find an
answer and everything?

01:22:50.853 --> 01:22:53.987
I meant it. Don't think I didn't.
And I still do.

01:22:53.989 --> 01:22:56.889
Maybe it would have been the
best chance I'll ever have...

01:22:56.891 --> 01:22:58.724
To be a lot of things
I'd like to be.

01:22:58.726 --> 01:23:02.327
Only I suppose you can't do a thing
like that just a little bit...

01:23:02.329 --> 01:23:04.796
mixing into other
people's lives, I mean.

01:23:04.798 --> 01:23:08.166
You can start something
maybe you can't finish.

01:23:08.168 --> 01:23:12.270
What got me was his being so
anxious to save me for posterity.

01:23:12.272 --> 01:23:15.406
I've never had anything do
my self-esteem so much good.

01:23:15.408 --> 01:23:19.209
So, I'd better go back and
give posterity another break.

01:23:19.211 --> 01:23:24.881
It won't hurt to wait a while
and see how things work out.

01:23:25.316 --> 01:23:27.382
That box in there
is a dress for elspeth.

01:23:27.384 --> 01:23:31.185
I saw it in a window, and it
just yelled to belong to her.

01:23:31.187 --> 01:23:35.389
Tell her I'll write, will you? Aren't
you going to wait and see them?

01:23:35.391 --> 01:23:38.458
No, I don't think so.
I might weaken.

01:23:38.993 --> 01:23:41.026
Hello, miss teasdale. Look who's here.
Sugar plum.

01:23:41.028 --> 01:23:43.962
Hello, miss corder. I hurried.
I-I hoped you'd be back.

01:23:43.964 --> 01:23:48.199
Well, here I am. Don't you look pretty?
Am I really all right?

01:23:48.201 --> 01:23:51.669
I've never seen an apple
blossom look quite as sweet.

01:23:51.671 --> 01:23:53.470
Here's a present for you, honey.

01:23:53.472 --> 01:23:57.574
Oh, I really shouldn't have another one.
May I look?

01:23:57.576 --> 01:23:58.708
Of course.

01:23:58.710 --> 01:24:01.844
Why don't you take it up to
your room and look at it there?

01:24:01.846 --> 01:24:04.713
That'll be nicer.
All right, I will.

01:24:04.715 --> 01:24:09.284
It's... it's like Christmas,
only much more so.

01:24:13.123 --> 01:24:15.022
Well.

01:24:15.024 --> 01:24:17.557
Does that mean good-bye then?
Sure.

01:24:17.559 --> 01:24:18.858
There's no use
making anything of it.

01:24:18.860 --> 01:24:22.228
That's one thing you learn in
my business... how to get off.

01:24:22.230 --> 01:24:26.832
I wish you wouldn't go. Maybe I'll be back.
Never can tell.

01:24:26.834 --> 01:24:29.701
You're a nice kid, Marjorie. I have
an idea you know what's going on.

01:24:29.703 --> 01:24:36.974
You might let me know. I'll get the price
on a laboratory or two, just in case.

01:24:38.344 --> 01:24:41.645
Well, good luck.

01:24:41.647 --> 01:24:45.248
Keep on telling her
she's pretty, will you?

01:24:45.250 --> 01:24:49.252
I will, Monica. Right.

01:24:57.261 --> 01:25:00.095
Honey, I...

01:25:05.502 --> 01:25:09.270
it sounds discouragingly healthy to me.
What's your zero hour exactly?

01:25:09.272 --> 01:25:14.975
2:00 this afternoon. Let me know
the minute it even shivers.

01:26:15.937 --> 01:26:21.573
Well, it hasn't got much longer.
The day of inquiry has just begun.

01:26:37.357 --> 01:26:39.990
Oh, I-I'm afraid I'd
forgotten you were here.

01:26:39.992 --> 01:26:41.891
I'm sorry. I should
have let you know.

01:26:41.893 --> 01:26:46.328
Well, I let elspeth stay down for a while.
What happened?

01:26:46.330 --> 01:26:49.164
Nothing. Nothing
happened at all.

01:26:49.166 --> 01:26:53.168
My figures clearly said the tail should
fall off, and the tail didn't fall off.

01:26:53.170 --> 01:26:57.805
I-I-it's seven percent above my figure.
I-it didn't fall off.

01:26:57.807 --> 01:27:02.376
Oh, I'm sorry.
Well, what happens now?

01:27:02.378 --> 01:27:06.780
Well, I-I-I've been thinking
about that on the way home.

01:27:06.782 --> 01:27:07.914
I'll go to the inquiry,

01:27:07.916 --> 01:27:12.852
and I'll stand up, and I'll explain my
figures to a group of very angry men,

01:27:12.854 --> 01:27:16.288
and then they'll reject
the whole thing.

01:27:16.290 --> 01:27:18.223
Then I'll sit down.

01:27:18.225 --> 01:27:23.127
I'll sit down and listen to them say that
I'm insane because of what I did in gander.

01:27:23.129 --> 01:27:27.431
And perhaps I am.
I-I'm not sure, you know.

01:27:27.433 --> 01:27:30.667
A qualified psychiatrist
will testify to that.

01:27:30.669 --> 01:27:34.937
I talked to three of them
this afternoon. They...

01:27:34.939 --> 01:27:37.039
no, that was yesterday,
wasn't it?

01:27:37.041 --> 01:27:40.308
But they showed me a page
of ink blots and asked me...

01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:42.376
If it reminded me
of elephants or tigers.

01:27:42.378 --> 01:27:48.348
Well, I... it didn't remind me of
elephants or ti... it was just ink blots.

01:27:48.350 --> 01:27:54.053
I-I-I think that the truth is only that
I-I've made a mistake somewhere in my work.

01:27:54.055 --> 01:28:00.359
I-I don't know where it is, but I have to
have time to find out where the mistake is.

01:28:00.361 --> 01:28:02.828
But there won't be any time.

01:28:02.830 --> 01:28:04.196
And my work'll be
thrown out in anger,

01:28:04.198 --> 01:28:09.134
and a principle that might've had one
grain of truth in it will be lost.

01:28:09.136 --> 01:28:14.706
But I'll sit there. I'll sit
there, and I won't say a word.

01:28:14.708 --> 01:28:16.674
And then what?

01:28:16.676 --> 01:28:18.642
Well, there's other work
to be done,

01:28:18.644 --> 01:28:21.044
and I'll get back
to doing it somewhere. I...

01:28:21.046 --> 01:28:23.579
with everything just as it was?

01:28:23.581 --> 01:28:27.316
Yes. I'm rather glad it's over.

01:28:27.318 --> 01:28:29.117
But you can't do that.

01:28:29.119 --> 01:28:31.185
You can't just sit
there and say nothing.

01:28:31.187 --> 01:28:35.756
If you believe something is right, you have
to do it if you want to live with yourself.

01:28:35.758 --> 01:28:39.760
If you don't, you'll have to pay for it
sooner or later, and so will elspeth.

01:28:39.762 --> 01:28:43.597
What about elspeth? Everything is
just to be as it was for her too?

01:28:43.599 --> 01:28:47.467
Yes, she was very glad to have it that way.
She was very happy.

01:28:47.469 --> 01:28:50.736
Oh, it's as simple
as that. I see.

01:28:50.738 --> 01:28:53.438
Well, I'm sorry. It's
the wrong time to talk.

01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:56.574
There isn't
very much point either.

01:28:57.143 --> 01:29:02.346
It's my last day, you know. But I'd
rather say good-bye when you come back.

01:29:02.348 --> 01:29:05.315
I start my job again tomorrow.

01:29:05.317 --> 01:29:07.750
Funny if they put me
back on reindeers.

01:29:07.752 --> 01:29:10.819
That really would be gander
all over again, wouldn't it?

01:29:10.821 --> 01:29:12.854
No, but you wouldn't do that?

01:29:12.856 --> 01:29:16.290
Supposing I did.
Would you let me?

01:29:33.275 --> 01:29:35.375
Hello.

01:29:35.377 --> 01:29:38.277
It's time to get ready
for school, isn't it?

01:29:38.279 --> 01:29:41.947
Yes. Did the tail
fall off, father?

01:29:41.949 --> 01:29:44.549
No, dear, it didn't.

01:29:44.551 --> 01:29:48.586
You mustn't worry about it.
It will someday.

01:29:48.588 --> 01:29:53.123
Oh, I don't know, dear.
I-I suppose it will.

01:29:54.759 --> 01:29:59.795
Is anything the matter?
No. I was just thinking.

01:30:00.798 --> 01:30:02.197
What about?

01:30:02.199 --> 01:30:07.569
Nothing. Just about the impermanence
of events and things like that.

01:30:07.571 --> 01:30:09.704
What do you mean, dear?

01:30:09.706 --> 01:30:12.206
Well, about it's all being over.

01:30:12.208 --> 01:30:15.509
Miss teasdale's gone,
and miss corder will be,

01:30:15.511 --> 01:30:17.711
and the people out in front...

01:30:17.713 --> 01:30:20.547
And everybody wanting to
talk to me at school...

01:30:20.549 --> 01:30:23.650
that sort of thing isn't
very permanent, is it?

01:30:23.652 --> 01:30:29.789
It's-it's like Christmas... everybody very
nice to everybody else for a little while,

01:30:29.791 --> 01:30:32.224
but then it doesn't last.

01:30:32.226 --> 01:30:34.292
Why is that, father?

01:30:34.294 --> 01:30:36.460
Oh, I don't know, dear.

01:30:36.462 --> 01:30:39.629
Don't they talk to you
all the time in school?

01:30:39.631 --> 01:30:43.065
Oh, no. I'm a swot, you know.

01:30:43.067 --> 01:30:46.868
Oh, I didn't know you were a swot.
What is a swot?

01:30:46.870 --> 01:30:49.303
Well, a swot is rather
the sort of person...

01:30:49.305 --> 01:30:52.773
People don't talk to very much
because they're different.

01:30:52.775 --> 01:30:56.143
Like my intellectual
quotient being too high.

01:30:56.145 --> 01:30:58.345
Well, do you mind being a swot?

01:30:58.347 --> 01:31:01.915
Oh, no. But it was exciting,
rather not being.

01:31:01.917 --> 01:31:05.084
Everybody wanting me to get
them autographs and things.

01:31:05.086 --> 01:31:08.987
But if things like that are so
impermanent, like Christmas,

01:31:08.989 --> 01:31:11.956
then it would be
much better if...

01:31:11.958 --> 01:31:13.791
I was thinking.

01:31:13.793 --> 01:31:16.794
I put away the things
miss teasdale gave me.

01:31:16.796 --> 01:31:20.731
And I was thinking maybe if I
didn't go to school anymore,

01:31:20.733 --> 01:31:22.799
I'm sure I'd learn
much more here with you,

01:31:22.801 --> 01:31:26.335
because there wouldn't be other
things to think about and...

01:31:26.337 --> 01:31:30.772
Things being impermanent and...

01:31:30.774 --> 01:31:36.544
Dear, what? Well, you mustn't do that.
What-what's the matter, dear?

01:31:36.546 --> 01:31:38.546
Go away!

01:31:44.086 --> 01:31:45.385
Well, are you sick, dear?

01:31:45.387 --> 01:31:47.620
I'm all right.

01:31:47.622 --> 01:31:51.223
Please go away
and leave me alone.

01:32:09.542 --> 01:32:13.043
I insist that to ground the
reindeer fleet even for 24 hours...

01:32:13.045 --> 01:32:17.747
Would be a tacit admission of the charge
that we have been flying unsafe aircraft.

01:32:17.749 --> 01:32:21.450
And I refuse to deal such a deathblow
to British transatlantic aviation...

01:32:21.452 --> 01:32:26.021
On what is now the unsupported
opinion of Mr. Theodore honey.

01:32:26.023 --> 01:32:30.058
I'd suggest that the kindest thing
that can be said of Mr. honey...

01:32:30.060 --> 01:32:31.659
Is that his
is an unstable mind...

01:32:31.661 --> 01:32:36.730
With an obsession that can carry him to great
extremes, as we have well seen in gander.

01:32:36.732 --> 01:32:39.733
I submit it is not only fair,
but imperative,

01:32:39.735 --> 01:32:44.704
that an immediate finding to that
effect be issued by this board.

01:32:46.641 --> 01:32:48.774
Well, gentlemen,
my view is that I...

01:32:48.776 --> 01:32:50.275
Mr. chairman,
I would like to try...

01:32:50.277 --> 01:32:54.679
now, wait a minute, Mr... Mr. chairman.
I'm going to say something.

01:32:54.681 --> 01:32:57.882
Now it isn't hard to see what you're
going to decide, and you can't do that.

01:32:57.884 --> 01:33:03.087
Now you're talking about me because of what
I did in gander. And this isn't personal.

01:33:03.089 --> 01:33:06.023
I didn't invent the mathematics
that made me believe what I did.

01:33:06.025 --> 01:33:09.092
And I still believe that there's
truth in my work... test or no test.

01:33:09.094 --> 01:33:12.161
When you believe in something, that's
what you've got to do, isn't it?

01:33:12.163 --> 01:33:14.062
If you want to live
with yourself.

01:33:14.064 --> 01:33:16.030
Now I don't know what
I'm going to do about this.

01:33:16.032 --> 01:33:19.833
I thought I might write the timessa letter.
I don't think they'd understand either.

01:33:19.835 --> 01:33:23.603
So, the first thing I'm going to do
is to resign right here and now...

01:33:23.605 --> 01:33:25.204
So the establishment
won't be mixed up in it.

01:33:25.206 --> 01:33:28.607
And then, every time a reindeer is
going to take off that shouldn't,

01:33:28.609 --> 01:33:30.442
I'm going out there
and wreck it.

01:33:30.444 --> 01:33:32.977
Now, you may put me in jail...
you may put me in jail,

01:33:32.979 --> 01:33:35.346
but they wrote a lot about me when
I wrecked that one in gander.

01:33:35.348 --> 01:33:38.982
They'll write more about me here. And
people just won't get on those airplanes.

01:33:38.984 --> 01:33:40.616
And I'm going to
tell you something else.

01:33:40.618 --> 01:33:42.751
The minute anything does happen
to one of these reindeers,

01:33:42.753 --> 01:33:44.986
you're going to have to think
of something better to say...

01:33:44.988 --> 01:33:48.055
Than anything I've heard
here this afternoon.

01:33:48.057 --> 01:33:49.990
That's all.

01:33:49.992 --> 01:33:54.227
Good day. That's all.

01:33:55.997 --> 01:34:00.866
Well, gentlemen...

01:34:06.106 --> 01:34:08.606
good afternoon.

01:34:09.308 --> 01:34:12.676
You know, there was some
Sherry around here someplace.

01:34:12.678 --> 01:34:15.078
I rather thought I'd have some.

01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:19.148
Uh, it's over by
that bookcase over there.

01:34:19.150 --> 01:34:21.416
Oh.

01:34:22.285 --> 01:34:25.719
Is it over? Yes, yes, it's over.

01:34:25.721 --> 01:34:29.322
I didn't stay for the end. I
made a speech, and then I left.

01:34:29.324 --> 01:34:34.560
What about? Oh, a whole lot of things.
Pretty good speech too.

01:34:35.162 --> 01:34:37.962
So you couldn't just
sit there, then? No.

01:34:37.964 --> 01:34:42.466
Are there any glasses?
Oh, here are some. No.

01:34:42.468 --> 01:34:46.937
I, uh... I resigned.

01:34:47.406 --> 01:34:51.040
You didn't. Well, I couldn't
just sit there, could I?

01:34:51.042 --> 01:34:53.275
Well, what-what are you
going to do to live on?

01:34:53.277 --> 01:34:56.378
There's elspeth. Have you got
any money at all, Mr. honey?

01:34:56.380 --> 01:34:58.913
Well, I don't know how much, but...
where's your book?

01:34:58.915 --> 01:35:01.849
Book? Well, it's right there.

01:35:04.820 --> 01:35:07.754
Do you know how much money
you have to live on?

01:35:07.756 --> 01:35:09.722
No. Three pounds, 13 and 6.

01:35:09.724 --> 01:35:14.460
No, wait. You haven't put
anything in the bank for months.

01:35:14.462 --> 01:35:16.228
What do you do with your money?

01:35:16.230 --> 01:35:21.099
I-I think there's some
over here in one of these.

01:35:21.101 --> 01:35:23.301
There. Here's some.

01:35:23.303 --> 01:35:25.803
Here's some more here.

01:35:28.674 --> 01:35:33.943
March, January.
Two, three, seven months!

01:35:33.945 --> 01:35:37.780
You haven't put anything
into the bank for seven months.

01:35:37.782 --> 01:35:40.916
You have lots of money.

01:35:40.918 --> 01:35:43.451
I shouldn't have worried,
should I?

01:35:43.453 --> 01:35:46.387
You don't need anyone.
Yeah, well...

01:35:46.389 --> 01:35:48.655
yes, you do. What's the matter?
You're not going to cry?

01:35:48.657 --> 01:35:53.860
I can't go away and leave you and
go back to work. It isn't safe.

01:35:53.862 --> 01:35:56.896
You've got to have
somebody looking after you.

01:35:56.898 --> 01:36:00.633
I'm going to marry you
and-and live here,

01:36:00.635 --> 01:36:03.402
whether you have a job or not.

01:36:03.404 --> 01:36:06.705
Well... you...

01:36:10.744 --> 01:36:11.776
thank you.

01:36:11.778 --> 01:36:15.513
Yes, and he'll probably do it too.
We'd better go see him before...

01:36:15.515 --> 01:36:17.248
your secretary
sent this over, sir John.

01:36:17.250 --> 01:36:20.484
She tried you at the meeting, but
they wouldn't put her through.

01:36:20.486 --> 01:36:23.553
She said it was very urgent.
Why, thank you.

01:36:26.691 --> 01:36:30.459
Where is sir David moon?
I hope he hasn't left.

01:36:30.461 --> 01:36:32.928
I can't wait for this.
It's from Nixon in labrador.

01:36:32.930 --> 01:36:37.032
He says they found the tail spar, and it's
a fatigue fracture if ever he saw one.

01:36:37.034 --> 01:36:40.802
Sir John, I've had the most incredible piece
of information. You haven't heard mine.

01:36:40.804 --> 01:36:44.739
They've just made the first test flight on
our plane at gander after it was repaired.

01:36:44.741 --> 01:36:46.474
It made a perfect landing
on the airport,

01:36:46.476 --> 01:36:48.709
and the tail collapsed while
it was taxiing to the hangar.

01:36:48.711 --> 01:36:52.979
I could hardly believe it, and I...
perhaps this will help you.

01:36:58.318 --> 01:37:03.020
We've received two messages from labrador
and gander which bear you out completely.

01:37:03.022 --> 01:37:04.554
Oh? Well, that's good.

01:37:04.556 --> 01:37:07.657
You-you know, I can't see where I
could have gone wrong in this.

01:37:07.659 --> 01:37:11.060
I've worked it out through three
different channels. Didn't you hear me?

01:37:32.616 --> 01:37:35.783
Ah, temperature. Temperature!

01:37:35.785 --> 01:37:37.985
That's it. That's a
variable factor, isn't it?

01:37:37.987 --> 01:37:40.921
If that plane in gander had
been flying in the tropics...

01:37:40.923 --> 01:37:42.188
this test is in a heated shed.

01:37:42.190 --> 01:37:47.660
It would have collapsed on schedule if
I'd lowered the temperature 40 degrees.
