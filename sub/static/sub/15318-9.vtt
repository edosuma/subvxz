09:46.958 --> 09:48.125
Nikola Tesla.

09:48.126 --> 09:48.959
[Laughs]
Wow.

09:48.960 --> 09:49.994
Like the scientist.

09:49.995 --> 09:51.729
Remarkably so.

09:51.730 --> 09:53.564
Come on in.

09:53.565 --> 09:54.765
Sorry,
I didn't mean

09:54.766 --> 09:56.467
to just come
unannounced, but--

09:56.468 --> 09:57.501
wow...

09:57.502 --> 10:00.638
I, uh, I didn't know
where else to turn.

10:00.639 --> 10:01.839
What do you mean?

10:03.041 --> 10:04.542
[Stammers]

10:04.543 --> 10:05.776
I work in
behavior analysis now.

10:05.777 --> 10:07.511
Serial killers,
stuff like that.

10:07.512 --> 10:08.813
Last month, my boss

10:08.814 --> 10:10.047
puts a stack of
dead cases on my desk.

10:10.048 --> 10:11.148
I'm supposed to just
file them away,

10:11.149 --> 10:14.085
but, well,
you know me.

10:14.086 --> 10:15.786
I couldn't resist
just taking a look.

10:15.787 --> 10:16.587
[Whoosh]

10:16.588 --> 10:18.055
[Button pops]

10:18.056 --> 10:19.457
I, uh...

10:19.458 --> 10:21.625
Sorry, what does that
have to do with...

10:21.626 --> 10:24.128
Well, one of them
was from, uh, around here.

10:24.129 --> 10:25.763
Detective Stanley O'Farrell?

10:25.764 --> 10:27.898
Uh... killed
a priest?

10:27.899 --> 10:29.533
Uh, uh, uh,
I'm sorry.

10:29.534 --> 10:30.534
Could you...

10:30.535 --> 10:32.536
Not...

10:32.537 --> 10:33.738
You're welcome.

10:35.640 --> 10:37.174
[Chuckles]

10:40.212 --> 10:41.645
[Chuckling awkwardly]

10:41.646 --> 10:43.080
I'm-I'm sorry about him.

10:43.081 --> 10:44.782
So, uh, the case, yes,

10:44.783 --> 10:47.184
uh, I-I think
I heard of it, yeah.

10:47.185 --> 10:48.619
So you know what I mean

10:48.620 --> 10:49.754
when I say there's
something hinky about it.

10:49.755 --> 10:52.223
The guy said he was coerced,

10:52.224 --> 10:54.525
and they found his family
locked up.

10:54.526 --> 10:55.860
Yeah, exactly.

10:55.861 --> 10:58.095
But between you and me,
I think there's more going on,

10:58.096 --> 10:59.096
someone behind the scenes,

10:59.097 --> 11:00.931
a puppet-master
pulling the strings,

11:00.932 --> 11:02.833
or...

11:02.834 --> 11:04.001
Hmm.

11:04.002 --> 11:05.269
Hmm...

11:05.270 --> 11:08.773
So, uh, what brings you here?

11:08.774 --> 11:11.208
Well, I just...

11:11.209 --> 11:14.011
Remembered
that you were always...

11:14.012 --> 11:15.780
Really good at
this kind of stuff.

11:15.781 --> 11:18.582
[Laughs]

11:18.583 --> 11:20.851
You know, seeing things
that other people didn't...

11:20.852 --> 11:23.721
[Laughs]

11:23.722 --> 11:25.322
Well, and to be totally honest,

11:25.323 --> 11:29.026
I've heard, uh,
rumors about this place.

11:29.027 --> 11:31.162
A lot of strange cases
loop back here.

11:32.564 --> 11:33.898
I just thought
you could help me

11:33.899 --> 11:36.100
interpret some
of this data.

11:36.101 --> 11:37.368
You know, I--

11:37.369 --> 11:40.604
just-just take a look
at the O'Farrell file.

11:40.605 --> 11:43.174
I think you'll be
surprised.

11:44.709 --> 11:47.111
[Sighs] Okay.

11:47.112 --> 11:48.279
[Laughing]

11:48.280 --> 11:49.713
Uh, and call me.

11:50.749 --> 11:51.715
[Stammers]

11:51.716 --> 11:53.350
Oh, for... y-yeah.

11:53.351 --> 11:54.251
[Giggling]

11:54.252 --> 11:55.119
Totally. Sure.

11:55.120 --> 11:56.320
Okay.

12:07.766 --> 12:09.300
That was Declan.

12:09.301 --> 12:11.969
I asked him to look into
the history of the region.

12:11.970 --> 12:14.638
It was occupied by
a number of nomadic empires,

12:14.639 --> 12:15.940
any of whom could have
cleared out that chamber.

12:15.941 --> 12:17.007
Come.

12:17.008 --> 12:18.342
Sit with me a moment.

12:18.343 --> 12:19.910
We have to stay on task, John.

12:19.911 --> 12:21.912
You can't sit and talk
at the same time?

12:23.648 --> 12:25.182
Come.

12:36.761 --> 12:38.095
Been a long time

12:38.096 --> 12:42.700
since you and I
enjoyed a sunset.

12:42.701 --> 12:43.701
Declan was able
to match

12:43.702 --> 12:44.869
the description
of the keystone

12:44.870 --> 12:46.737
to an artifact acquired
by the British Museum

12:46.738 --> 12:47.771
30 years ago.

12:47.772 --> 12:48.839
It's a wild
goose chase.

12:48.840 --> 12:49.874
We have to try.

12:49.875 --> 12:51.208
Do we?

12:51.209 --> 12:52.443
You're the one

12:52.444 --> 12:54.745
who didn't want to
show Worth the map,

12:54.746 --> 12:56.680
and all this
traveling,

12:56.681 --> 12:59.250
it's not good for you.

12:59.251 --> 13:00.251
Let me take you home.

13:00.252 --> 13:01.719
To do what?

13:01.720 --> 13:02.720
To die?

13:02.721 --> 13:04.788
Oh no.

13:04.789 --> 13:05.923
No, we'll find another way.

13:05.924 --> 13:07.858
And what about my father?

13:07.859 --> 13:08.759
And the underground
city?

13:08.760 --> 13:10.761
Please, John.

13:10.762 --> 13:12.396
There has to be some truth
to what Worth said.

13:12.397 --> 13:13.831
Does there?

13:13.832 --> 13:17.101
We found the pedestal.

13:19.704 --> 13:20.738
John...

13:22.841 --> 13:26.377
Take me to London.

13:28.413 --> 13:29.847
It's been
a long time

13:29.848 --> 13:32.716
since I've heard
you say that.

13:43.295 --> 13:45.029
[Knocks] Hey.

13:45.030 --> 13:47.331
These files you gave me,
where'd you get them?

13:47.332 --> 13:50.935
Uh, just
an FBI friend. Why?

13:50.936 --> 13:52.303
They're from Tartarus.

13:53.305 --> 13:54.338
Top secret
satellite-fed database?

13:54.339 --> 13:55.739
Yeah, yeah.

13:55.740 --> 13:57.141
I know what
Tartarus is.

13:57.142 --> 13:58.976
Yeah, well, nobody has access
to this stuff,

13:58.977 --> 13:59.944
not even us.

13:59.945 --> 14:01.345
So?

14:01.346 --> 14:03.380
So...

14:08.053 --> 14:09.787
Detective O'Farrell's
autopsy reports.

14:09.788 --> 14:11.922
Magnus and I saw
the official ones,

14:11.923 --> 14:13.724
and this ain't it.

14:13.725 --> 14:14.925
Well, what's
different about it?

14:14.926 --> 14:16.493
Well, how about
cause of death?

14:16.494 --> 14:18.195
The one that we saw
said "aneurysm."

14:18.196 --> 14:19.897
This one says "unknown,"

14:19.898 --> 14:21.498
and check out
all the medical data.

14:21.499 --> 14:22.833
They suppressed all this?

14:22.834 --> 14:24.168
That surprises you?

14:26.037 --> 14:27.471
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Go back.

14:27.472 --> 14:29.039
Yeah, there.

14:29.040 --> 14:30.341
What are those things?

14:30.342 --> 14:31.742
Let me check
our database.

14:33.244 --> 14:35.112
Those...

14:35.113 --> 14:37.915
Are Harper mites.

14:37.916 --> 14:39.350
It's a microscopic abnormal

14:39.351 --> 14:40.985
that floats harmlessly
in the bloodstream

14:40.986 --> 14:43.187
until exposed to
ultrasonic radiation.

14:43.188 --> 14:44.688
At which point

14:44.689 --> 14:45.756
it enters an accelerated
reproductive cycle--

14:45.757 --> 14:47.758
creating a blockage,

14:47.759 --> 14:51.195
which could be mistaken
as an aneurysm.

14:51.196 --> 14:53.897
Huh.

14:53.898 --> 14:57.835
So, Detective O'Farrell
didn't die of natural causes.

14:57.836 --> 14:59.837
Nope. He was killed,

14:59.838 --> 15:03.407
by somebody using abnormals
as a weapon.

15:08.126 --> 15:11.328
I remember the artifact
you're looking for.

15:11.329 --> 15:12.062
Curious piece.

15:12.100 --> 15:14.235
It was recovered
from a massive tomb

15:14.236 --> 15:15.336
in Batshireet,

15:15.337 --> 15:16.804
along with several
other treasures

15:16.805 --> 15:20.241
said to belong
to Genghis Khan,

15:20.242 --> 15:21.308
but the symbols on it

15:21.309 --> 15:24.211
more closely resemble
ancient Sumerian--

15:24.212 --> 15:25.446
Sorry,

15:25.447 --> 15:27.181
but we're in
a bit of a hurry.

15:28.984 --> 15:30.217
Yes, well...

15:30.218 --> 15:32.186
I'm not entirely sure

15:32.187 --> 15:34.889
why I'm handing a priceless
treasure over to you

15:34.890 --> 15:35.956
with no strings attached,

15:35.957 --> 15:39.126
but when
the head of MI6

15:39.127 --> 15:40.895
calls you personally,

15:40.896 --> 15:42.663
I guess you can't argue,
can you?

15:44.166 --> 15:45.666
Hmm.

15:47.969 --> 15:50.304
Ah, here we are.

15:59.347 --> 16:01.715
All I ask is that
you take care with it.

16:01.716 --> 16:04.318
Yes?

16:04.319 --> 16:05.886
It'll never leave our hands.

16:08.957 --> 16:11.892
I say, I'm a bit of
a history buff,

16:11.893 --> 16:15.029
and you bear
a remarkable resemblance to--

16:15.030 --> 16:16.797
[whoosh]

16:22.804 --> 16:24.972
All right, I have
good news and bad news.

16:24.973 --> 16:26.240
What do you want to hear first?

16:26.241 --> 16:27.908
The good news, please.

16:27.909 --> 16:29.310
The good--
oh...

16:29.311 --> 16:30.644
Yeah, it doesn't really
make sense

16:30.645 --> 16:31.846
if I tell it in that order.

16:33.715 --> 16:35.049
Bad news,

16:35.050 --> 16:36.517
the missing crate
is still missing.

16:36.518 --> 16:37.418
I tracked it from its
original destination,

16:37.419 --> 16:38.686
through all ports of call.

16:38.687 --> 16:40.154
According to
everyone involved,

16:40.155 --> 16:42.156
it was on its way here
as of this morning.

16:42.157 --> 16:43.424
So, what happened?

16:43.425 --> 16:44.725
Well, I called the driver,
Angelo--

16:44.726 --> 16:45.793
wait,

16:45.794 --> 16:47.728
is this still the bad news?

16:47.729 --> 16:48.829
He didn't answer.

16:50.031 --> 16:51.665
But I have an idea.

16:53.068 --> 16:54.668
And that's the good news.

16:54.669 --> 16:57.037
It's a really good idea.

16:57.038 --> 16:58.305
It's a bird.

16:58.306 --> 16:59.773
This is not just
any bird, Will.

16:59.774 --> 17:01.008
This is a crimson kiteshark,

17:01.009 --> 17:02.376
whose prey of choice
just happens to be...

17:02.377 --> 17:03.377
Cypher beetles?

17:03.378 --> 17:04.744
Bingo.

17:04.746 --> 17:06.480
Ziggy here has one of
the keenest senses of smell

17:06.481 --> 17:07.882
in the abnormal world.

17:07.883 --> 17:09.782
I've been training him
for years using oranges.

17:09.784 --> 17:11.318
If there's a Cypher beetle
out there,

17:11.319 --> 17:12.685
Ziggy will find it.

17:12.686 --> 17:16.089
Unless he runs across
a Tropicana truck first.

17:16.090 --> 17:17.724
Yeah, no, that's not
going to happen.

17:17.726 --> 17:19.260
Will, it's
going to be fine.

17:19.261 --> 17:20.394
Watch this.

17:20.395 --> 17:21.395
All right, Ziggy,

17:21.396 --> 17:22.229
it's time to go
to work, buddy.

17:22.230 --> 17:23.230
[Screeching]

17:26.468 --> 17:28.002
[Tracker pings]

17:28.002 --> 17:29.403
All right, with any luck,

17:29.404 --> 17:31.071
we should have that crate home
in time for dinner.

17:31.072 --> 17:33.274
Well, if you do, I'm buying.

17:33.275 --> 17:35.910
Just make sure Ziggy doesn't
eat dinner before we do.

17:39.447 --> 17:40.848
Right.

17:40.849 --> 17:41.882
Ah!

17:41.883 --> 17:43.150
Back already.

17:43.151 --> 17:44.518
You thought
we'd be longer?

17:44.519 --> 17:46.253
Actually,
yes, I did.

17:46.254 --> 17:47.988
How's the source blood
shield coming?

17:47.989 --> 17:50.024
Well, it's more
of a cloak now.

17:50.025 --> 17:51.058
Well done.

17:51.059 --> 17:52.393
Yeah, except
it still doesn't work.

17:52.394 --> 17:54.094
Every time I try
to reset the map to test it,

17:54.095 --> 17:56.797
I end up tripping off
the alarm.

17:56.798 --> 17:57.965
Wow.

17:57.966 --> 17:59.500
Where did you find it?

17:59.501 --> 18:01.068
British Museum.

18:01.069 --> 18:02.036
Where does it go?

18:02.037 --> 18:04.805
Well, according to Worth,

18:04.806 --> 18:06.040
it goes
over here.

18:15.817 --> 18:16.884
Hmm.

18:16.885 --> 18:19.119
This wasn't here before.

18:26.328 --> 18:28.429
[Device thrumming]

18:31.967 --> 18:33.801
Now, what does
that mean?

18:33.802 --> 18:34.835
Well, whatever
it is,

18:34.836 --> 18:35.970
it can't be good.

18:35.971 --> 18:37.538
[Thrumming ramps down]

18:39.107 --> 18:43.877
It rejected it. Why?

18:45.847 --> 18:47.414
To be totally honest,

18:47.415 --> 18:49.083
I didn't think
you'd call.

18:49.084 --> 18:51.085
Well, turns out
you were right.

18:51.086 --> 18:52.219
There is more
to those murders

18:52.220 --> 18:53.287
than meets the eye.

18:53.288 --> 18:54.421
The weird
medical data, right?

18:54.422 --> 18:55.889
Do you know
what it is?

18:55.890 --> 18:58.525
No, but I thought maybe
we could go through

18:58.526 --> 19:00.060
the remaining files
together,

19:00.061 --> 19:01.528
and see if we can't
find a pattern.

19:01.529 --> 19:02.830
Yeah, totally.

19:02.831 --> 19:04.231
[Gasps] Then maybe

19:04.232 --> 19:05.799
you can give me
a tour of this place.

29:20.121 --> 29:22.055
Well, this is
starting to sound

29:22.056 --> 29:24.525
a little bit
too familiar.

29:35.003 --> 29:38.205
This is the place.

29:38.206 --> 29:40.107
I'm detecting
gamma radiation

29:40.108 --> 29:41.141
below us,

29:41.142 --> 29:42.409
the penthouse.

29:42.410 --> 29:44.378
The keystone.

29:44.379 --> 29:47.181
So, what can we expect?

29:47.182 --> 29:48.916
Well, I had my suspicions
about the buyer,

29:48.917 --> 29:50.150
so I checked his name

29:50.151 --> 29:51.552
against the beijing
Sanctuary's database.

29:51.553 --> 29:53.253
Turns out he's a seralops,

29:53.254 --> 29:55.456
a humanoid abnormal
that craves gamma radiation

29:55.457 --> 29:56.890
like a drug.

29:56.891 --> 29:58.492
So he's not giving it up
without a fight.

29:58.493 --> 29:59.526
I'm afraid not.

30:03.264 --> 30:04.264
Helen.

30:04.265 --> 30:06.099
I'm fine.

30:06.100 --> 30:07.468
Let me do this.

30:07.469 --> 30:09.636
You've been exposed to
enough radiation as it is.

30:11.206 --> 30:13.106
The dose coming off
the keystone

30:13.107 --> 30:14.074
isn't enough to worry about.

30:15.643 --> 30:17.644
I'm coming with you,
and that's that.

30:17.645 --> 30:18.745
In for a Penny...

30:18.746 --> 30:19.847
[Will]: I hate to be
Captain obvious,

30:19.848 --> 30:22.483
but this has to be
the work of the same guy.

30:22.484 --> 30:23.417
Then what's he targeting?

30:23.418 --> 30:24.485
That,
I don't know.

30:24.486 --> 30:25.586
Well, we better
figure it out,

30:25.587 --> 30:26.887
'cause there could be

30:26.888 --> 30:29.623
hundreds more of these
beetles out there.

30:29.624 --> 30:31.758
Okay, in Atlanta,

30:31.759 --> 30:33.260
he targeted
a shop owner.

30:33.261 --> 30:34.561
In Chicago, he
targeted a politician--

30:34.562 --> 30:36.163
and here, a priest.

30:36.164 --> 30:37.564
[Tesla]: Well, what's
the connection?

30:37.565 --> 30:38.532
Abnormals.

30:38.533 --> 30:39.933
Yeah, we know.

30:39.934 --> 30:41.568
He uses abnormals
to cover his tracks--

30:41.569 --> 30:42.970
No, no,

30:42.971 --> 30:44.705
hey, where are those
supply requisitions

30:44.706 --> 30:45.672
I signed for
this morning?

30:45.673 --> 30:47.407
I Fedexed them.

30:47.408 --> 30:48.442
They got back-up.

30:48.443 --> 30:49.676
What's the name
of the shop in Atlanta?

30:50.712 --> 30:52.346
Duke's daisies?

30:52.347 --> 30:53.313
[Groans]

30:56.651 --> 30:57.885
See?
Look at this.

30:57.886 --> 30:59.987
They're the biggest grower
in the country.

30:59.988 --> 31:01.588
They supply thousands
of rare plants

31:01.589 --> 31:03.123
to the New York
Sanctuary.

31:03.124 --> 31:04.324
What about the
politician in Chicago?

31:04.325 --> 31:07.494
He was the swing vote
on council.

31:07.495 --> 31:08.962
Without him,
a proposed rail line

31:08.963 --> 31:10.330
that would have cut through
several west side neighborhoods

31:10.331 --> 31:11.698
was approved.

31:11.699 --> 31:13.166
Displacing a community
of abnormals.

31:13.167 --> 31:14.368
and here.

31:14.369 --> 31:15.636
Father Jensen
was the chief caretaker

31:15.637 --> 31:17.037
of the Fifth Ward.

31:17.038 --> 31:18.539
Okay, okay,

31:18.540 --> 31:20.274
so, he's targeting abnormals
and their support systems.

31:20.275 --> 31:21.775
Well done.

31:21.776 --> 31:23.577
It still doesn't tell you
what he's planning to do here../

31:23.578 --> 31:24.511
well, most

31:24.512 --> 31:26.146
mission-oriented
serial killers

31:26.147 --> 31:27.748
escalate their behavior
over time.

31:27.749 --> 31:29.716
He must be after something big.

31:29.717 --> 31:31.151
The vigil.

31:31.152 --> 31:34.454
Dozens of abnormals,
all in one place.

31:34.455 --> 31:35.989
Oh, my God.
They get infected,

31:35.990 --> 31:37.124
chaos spreads
into the streets.

31:37.125 --> 31:38.559
People retaliate,

31:38.560 --> 31:41.261
and the community
gets hit even harder.

31:41.262 --> 31:51.138
[♪]

32:01.671 --> 32:03.038
Quietly.

32:04.774 --> 32:06.541
Of course.

32:31.734 --> 32:33.068
John...

32:33.069 --> 32:34.770
What the hell
are you two doing here?

32:39.509 --> 32:40.676
I don't recall

32:40.677 --> 32:41.710
inviting
you to the party.

32:51.120 --> 32:52.587
John!

32:56.092 --> 32:58.493
Good, it hasn't started yet.

32:58.494 --> 33:00.462
You're early.

33:00.463 --> 33:01.930
Please,

33:01.931 --> 33:02.898
sit wherever you like.

33:02.899 --> 33:04.399
Father Clark,
right?

33:04.400 --> 33:05.968
Yes.

33:05.969 --> 33:07.669
I'm sorry,

33:07.670 --> 33:09.037
but we're going to
have to cancel the vigil.

33:09.038 --> 33:10.405
Someone's planning
to attack it.

33:10.406 --> 33:11.440
What? How?

33:11.441 --> 33:13.008
It's a long story.

33:13.009 --> 33:14.576
You're just going to
have to take our word for it.

33:14.577 --> 33:15.844
[Whispering]: What is it?

33:15.845 --> 33:17.012
But we can't
cancel.

33:17.013 --> 33:18.580
Everyone's
due to arrive.

33:18.581 --> 33:19.548
What will we
tell them?

33:19.549 --> 33:22.851
That it's for
their own safety.

33:22.852 --> 33:23.986
[Kate]:
What is it?

33:23.987 --> 33:25.687
<i>Smell something...</i>

33:25.688 --> 33:28.190
[Clark]: I appreciate what
you're trying to do,

33:28.191 --> 33:29.992
but I haven't heard
anything about a threat,

33:29.993 --> 33:32.461
and I'm not going to cancel
based on your say-so.

33:32.462 --> 33:34.129
Father Clark?

33:34.130 --> 33:37.599
What was father Jensen's
favorite holiday?

33:37.600 --> 33:39.568
What?

33:39.569 --> 33:40.569
I don't know.

33:42.038 --> 33:44.906
You two were friends.

33:44.907 --> 33:46.842
He never
mentioned it.

33:46.843 --> 33:49.177
Ah...

33:49.178 --> 33:51.747
What was
his favorite food?

33:51.748 --> 33:52.948
My son...

33:52.949 --> 33:54.182
Curry!

33:54.183 --> 33:57.019
He prepared it
every Friday night.

33:57.020 --> 34:00.789
What kind of car
did he drive?

34:00.790 --> 34:03.759
A... sedan?

34:03.760 --> 34:04.860
Uhh..

34:04.861 --> 34:06.928
He didn't drive.

34:06.929 --> 34:09.563
Terrified of it.

34:09.565 --> 34:13.101
I had to drive him everywhere.

34:14.704 --> 34:16.004
I'm sorry,

34:16.005 --> 34:17.472
but I don't have time
for this.

34:17.473 --> 34:19.041
I have to set up
for the vigil--

Who are you?

34:21.777 --> 34:24.146

So, now what?

35:10.828 --> 35:12.896
Well, we can't stay
in here forever.

35:16.367 --> 35:17.233
What are you doing?

35:17.234 --> 35:19.702
Hank taught me this.

35:21.105 --> 35:23.473
Okay, stand by.

35:26.443 --> 35:27.310
Get ready.

35:27.311 --> 35:28.211
For what?

35:28.212 --> 35:29.145

this cleaned up.

you were going to catch me?

36:16.060 --> 36:17.660
You're nothing
but an animal

36:17.661 --> 36:18.828
that needs to be
put down.

36:18.829 --> 36:21.497
You killed my friend.

36:23.267 --> 36:24.901
You killed

36:24.902 --> 36:26.970
so many.

36:26.971 --> 36:29.505
They deserved to die,

36:29.506 --> 36:32.008
for helping you
and your kind,

36:32.009 --> 36:33.643
and once you're gone,

36:33.644 --> 36:35.578

42:23.560 --> 42:26.462
I'm barely
handling it at all.

42:26.463 --> 42:27.897
You stopped
a serial killer

42:27.898 --> 42:29.165
who had eluded
authorities

42:29.166 --> 42:30.166
for months,

42:30.167 --> 42:32.101
who threatened
to further destabilize

42:32.102 --> 42:33.369
the lives of abnormals.

42:33.370 --> 42:34.537
It was a lucky break.

42:36.473 --> 42:38.908
Well, sometimes that's
the best we can hope for.

42:41.945 --> 42:44.046
We're going underground?

42:56.593 --> 42:58.027
That's good.

42:58.028 --> 42:59.061
You know why?

43:00.597 --> 43:03.532
'Cause we're
going to get there.

43:03.533 --> 43:06.002
We're going to
find the city.
