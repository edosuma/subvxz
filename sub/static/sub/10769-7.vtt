00:18.618 --> 00:20.813
Stop.

00:21.121 --> 00:23.055
Why?

00:24.257 --> 00:26.418
Derek, stop.

00:26.593 --> 00:28.185
Okay.

00:28.361 --> 00:30.522
Why'd you stop?

00:33.166 --> 00:35.600
I lost my head.

00:45.378 --> 00:50.338
You know, Ash, it's been great being back
in town visiting all the colleges...

00:50.517 --> 00:52.883
...but the best part
has been being with you.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.384
Oh.

00:56.122 --> 00:57.453
I miss you.

00:57.624 --> 00:58.921
Me too.

00:59.092 --> 01:02.619
Sixteen years on the same street
and you had to blow it by moving.

01:02.796 --> 01:06.755
If I don't get into Stanford, I'll go to ULA.
And then I'll be around all the time.

01:06.933 --> 01:11.768
Derek, you'll get in. You're too smart.
I wish you were dumber.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.734
I'd have a boyfriend again.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.342
Hey, you never stopped having one.

01:17.510 --> 01:22.470
- You're saying that because you like me.
- No. I'm saying that because I love you.

01:26.853 --> 01:28.514
Aw!

01:31.991 --> 01:34.653
Look at you two.

01:34.828 --> 01:39.094
Almost a year apart and you two lovebirds
haven't missed a beat.

01:39.265 --> 01:41.290
Will, look...
- Not another word.

01:41.468 --> 01:42.662
I'm not gonna disturb you.

01:42.836 --> 01:46.294
I'm gonna just go in the kitchen
and get me a little beverage or something.

01:51.377 --> 01:55.040
Although,
these are the moments of your life.

01:55.215 --> 01:57.615
- Will.
- Oh, no, no, you're right.

01:57.784 --> 02:02.187
You guys are grown adults and I don't have
no business disrespecting you like this.

02:02.355 --> 02:03.982
I'm sorry. I'm gonna just go away.

02:06.993 --> 02:09.393
- I'm sorry.
- Hey.

02:09.562 --> 02:11.462
I got something for you.

02:11.631 --> 02:14.896
- Oh, Derek, what is it?
- Just open it.

02:16.736 --> 02:19.569
Oh, a little horse.

02:19.739 --> 02:23.573
Yep. That's from when we rode the carousel
down at the pier.

02:23.743 --> 02:26.769
- That's when we first held hands.
- Uh-uh-uh.

02:26.946 --> 02:29.073
Oh, ha, ha, my God, a little Rollerblade.

02:29.249 --> 02:32.878
Eh? Remember when we went roller skating
down in Venice?

02:33.052 --> 02:35.577
That's when we first kissed.

02:35.989 --> 02:40.085
Derek, this is so sweet.
I can't believe you did this.

02:40.560 --> 02:43.961
You know,
we've had a lot of firsts together.

02:44.130 --> 02:45.995
I know.

02:47.233 --> 02:49.793
You know, Ashley, there's a...

02:49.969 --> 02:52.494
There's another first
I think we should do together.

02:52.672 --> 02:54.333
Really? What?

02:57.076 --> 03:01.012
Well, I love you, Ashley,
and I think we should make love.

03:06.920 --> 03:09.047
Together?

04:29.102 --> 04:30.467
Good morning, Geoffrey.

04:30.637 --> 04:33.800
Playing dress-up again, Master Carlton?

04:33.973 --> 04:36.806
For your information,
I'm installing the new intercom system.

04:36.976 --> 04:38.068
You?

04:43.483 --> 04:48.045
Yuck it up, Brit boy,
but remember, he who laughs last...

04:53.192 --> 04:54.352
Laughs best.

04:59.499 --> 05:03.560
You know,
I kind of remember him being taller.

05:03.936 --> 05:05.699
Really? I don't.

05:08.441 --> 05:09.499
Excuse me, Carlton.

05:09.676 --> 05:11.644
I'm gonna let that one slide, young man.

05:11.811 --> 05:14.302
Obviously,
you've fallen in with a bad element.

05:15.081 --> 05:18.949
Derek, I'm telling you, you'd love ULA.
You gotta come down and check it out.

05:19.118 --> 05:21.177
- Me and my man, we call it the Hive.
- Hmm?

05:21.354 --> 05:22.912
Because the honeys be swarming.

05:23.089 --> 05:24.147
- Can you hear me?
- Oh.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.757
Can you hear me?

05:26.159 --> 05:27.626
Oh, hi, Derek.

05:27.794 --> 05:29.887
Oh, hi, Ashley.

05:30.663 --> 05:33.223
That's disgusting.

05:33.399 --> 05:35.128
No. Actually, Carlton, that's a kiss.

05:35.301 --> 05:38.065
If you're lucky,
one day you'll experience one.

05:38.705 --> 05:41.674
Very funny. By the way, Will,
I just got a call from Oz...

05:41.841 --> 05:44.469
...the Wizard said your brain is ready.

05:45.044 --> 05:47.103
So, Ash, we're still on for tonight, right?

05:47.714 --> 05:49.113
Yeah.

05:49.282 --> 05:52.183
What are you, tripping, man?
She can't say no to you.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.444
- Will.
- What?

05:53.619 --> 05:56.520
That's great. I gotta go do a couple errands.
I'm out of here.

05:56.689 --> 05:58.247
Okay. Bye.

05:58.424 --> 06:00.255
I'm watching you, mister.

06:00.426 --> 06:02.690
Really? Let me help you.

06:07.133 --> 06:09.931
I never liked the cut of that boy's jib.

06:10.570 --> 06:14.233
I'm not sure you should be admitting
you've been looking at that boy's jib.

06:18.144 --> 06:20.112
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, baby.

06:20.279 --> 06:23.544
- Um, has Mom called yet?
- Yeah, you just missed her.

06:23.716 --> 06:25.980
- Is there something I can help you with?
- No. No.

06:26.152 --> 06:29.986
I just wanted to see how her conference
was going. I had a question about, uh...

06:30.156 --> 06:32.488
Um... Makeup, heh.

06:32.658 --> 06:34.091
Makeup?

06:34.260 --> 06:35.921
Keep away from that blue eye shadow.

06:37.730 --> 06:40.392
Great. Thanks, Dad.

06:42.201 --> 06:44.032
Hilary, can I talk to you for a minute?

06:44.203 --> 06:47.366
Not now, Ash,
my show starts in five minutes.

06:47.974 --> 06:50.499
Uh-oh. Big-sister radar.

06:55.314 --> 06:56.804
It's important, isn't it?

06:57.650 --> 07:00.619
I can tell. I have, like,
a third sense about these things.

07:06.058 --> 07:09.892
Hilary, do you remember the first time
you fell in love?

07:10.329 --> 07:12.092
Oh, this is important.

07:12.265 --> 07:15.166
Ha, ha. Come. Come. Come.

07:15.334 --> 07:17.825
Sit. Sit. Sit.

07:20.039 --> 07:23.941
It was Lawrence Young,
the most beautiful man at Bel-Air Prep.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.943
Oh! To put it simply, he was a god.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.673
He had been held back three years
so he was really buff.

07:29.849 --> 07:33.285
- Oh, he had the most amazing...
- Hilary. Hilary. Hilary, I get the picture.

07:35.388 --> 07:37.185
Oh, Ashley, are you in love?

07:37.924 --> 07:40.324
I think so. I feel like Derek's the one.

07:40.493 --> 07:43.223
I don't think I'll ever feel this way
about anybody else.

07:43.663 --> 07:47.531
Oh, Ash, I am so happy for you.

07:47.700 --> 07:50.533
But long-distance relationships
don't usually work out.

07:50.703 --> 07:53.638
I mean, look at the Little Mermaid.

07:55.208 --> 07:58.905
I mean, she was stuck in the sea
and he was stuck on land.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.905
But they ended up together.

08:02.081 --> 08:05.517
Yeah, with the help of a lobster.
You know a lobster?

08:09.722 --> 08:13.590
Look, Hilary, Derek and I
have been spending a lot of time together...

08:13.759 --> 08:16.125
...and we really care about each other.

08:16.696 --> 08:20.792
And last night,
the subject came up about, um...

08:21.067 --> 08:22.591
...uh, sex.

08:22.768 --> 08:23.792
Oh.

08:23.970 --> 08:25.938
- Oh, did you?
- No, no.

08:26.105 --> 08:27.595
No, heh.

08:27.773 --> 08:30.469
But I've been thinking about it...

08:31.444 --> 08:34.106
...and I just wanna know
how you know if...

08:34.280 --> 08:38.842
I can just tell you that for me,
Lawrence and I really loved each other...

08:39.018 --> 08:43.886
...and we both felt that we were able
to make a responsible decision.

08:44.090 --> 08:46.251
We decided that the time was right.

08:46.926 --> 08:48.257
Any regrets?

08:48.427 --> 08:50.691
Didn't I tell you he was buff? Hello.

08:57.670 --> 08:59.797
But, I mean, Hilary, weren't you scared?

08:59.972 --> 09:03.931
Of course, everyone is. But I was ready.

09:04.110 --> 09:07.011
And only you know if you're ready or not.

09:08.180 --> 09:12.549
Ashley, for as long as I can remember,
you have been independent...

09:12.718 --> 09:15.209
...responsible and smart.

09:16.622 --> 09:19.591
Now, I know you're aware
of all the issues...

09:19.759 --> 09:24.196
...and whatever decision you do make,
I'm always here for you.

09:26.365 --> 09:27.389
Thank you, Hilary.

09:29.635 --> 09:30.966
Oh.

09:31.671 --> 09:35.505
Hoo! Now I know how Mom felt
when we had this talk.

09:36.309 --> 09:40.370
- What did Daddy say when you told him?
- Are you kidding? He still thinks I'm a virgin.

09:45.751 --> 09:47.412
Okay, what do you think?

09:47.753 --> 09:48.777
Nope.

09:50.423 --> 09:54.291
Well, if you guys don't pick one, I'll be
going on this date wearing a headband.

09:54.460 --> 09:56.394
I'm sure Derek wouldn't mind.

09:57.029 --> 09:59.293
Keesha, he's not like that.

09:59.465 --> 10:01.626
He says we're soul mates.

10:01.801 --> 10:04.964
I don't know what I'm gonna do
when he leaves. I miss him already.

10:05.838 --> 10:07.533
Somebody is in love.

10:10.076 --> 10:12.840
So, um, are you guys, you know?

10:13.212 --> 10:14.975
No.

10:15.147 --> 10:16.739
Have you guys ever?

10:16.916 --> 10:18.781
Nope.

10:19.885 --> 10:22.649
But it sounds like you're getting close.

10:22.822 --> 10:27.418
Well, all I know is when Derek and I
make love, it'll be special.

10:27.927 --> 10:30.623
- When?
- lf.

10:31.797 --> 10:35.460
Will, the new intercom system
is working like gangbusters.

10:35.635 --> 10:38.433
Now we can talk to one another
from different rooms.

10:38.604 --> 10:41.232
I don't wanna talk to you
when we're in the same room.

10:41.407 --> 10:45.776
Check out the exciting new roam feature.
Let's listen to my room.

10:48.814 --> 10:51.282
Well, all's quiet in there.

10:52.051 --> 10:54.542
Oh, there's a surprise.

10:55.054 --> 10:57.352
Subject: Geoffrey's room.

10:57.523 --> 11:01.755
<i>I wonder
how I'd look if I shaved my entire body.</i>

11:03.596 --> 11:05.154
Changing channels.

11:05.831 --> 11:07.992
<i>If you and Derek have sex...</i>

11:08.167 --> 11:10.567
<i>... you'll be the first one in our group
to lose her virginity.</i>

11:11.671 --> 11:14.196
Derek is leaving tomorrow.
So are you gonna do it?

11:14.573 --> 11:17.064
Keesha, it's not "doing it."
It's making love.

11:17.243 --> 11:20.144
<i>And, yes, I think we're gonna do it tonight.</i>

11:32.725 --> 11:34.659
Oh, my God. What are we gonna do?

11:34.827 --> 11:37.387
This is what we're gonna do,
we're gonna stop listening.

11:37.563 --> 11:40.157
You're right.
Enough listening, time for action.

11:40.332 --> 11:41.629
She needs de-programming.

11:41.801 --> 11:44.736
We'll make her watch movies.
Lots of movies. Doris Day movies.

11:44.904 --> 11:46.872
Now, there's a good
wholesome role model.

11:47.039 --> 11:52.602
<i>Que sera sera, whatever will be, will be</i>

11:52.778 --> 11:55.372
Wait a minute.
"Whatever will be, will be"?

11:55.548 --> 11:57.914
What kind of devil-may-care message
is that?

11:59.051 --> 12:01.315
- The slut.
- Okay, Carlton. Carlton.

12:01.487 --> 12:03.318
Look, you need to calm down, all right?

12:03.489 --> 12:06.947
Look, we need to find a Yellow Pages.
I'm calling a nunnery.

12:07.126 --> 12:10.254
It's late, so I'll need a 24-hour one.

12:10.429 --> 12:12.090
Carlton, man, we ain't even Catholic.

12:12.264 --> 12:14.061
Oh! Would you have an open mind?

12:14.233 --> 12:16.258
Carlton, are you listening to yourself?

12:16.435 --> 12:20.064
I don't have time for that. I know,
we'll do the good-cop, bad-cop thing.

12:20.239 --> 12:22.764
I'm her brother
so it's appropriate I play the bad cop.

12:22.942 --> 12:25.740
- No, Carlton...
- Okay, big baby. You can be the bad cop.

12:25.911 --> 12:27.674
- Let's move.
- Carlton.

12:27.847 --> 12:29.815
Carlton.

12:30.049 --> 12:33.109
What is...? What is wrong with you?

12:33.285 --> 12:35.480
Would you unhand me?

12:35.654 --> 12:38.214
You gonna go upstairs
and make a fool out of yourself?

12:38.390 --> 12:42.952
If need be.
Someone has to stop the insanity.

12:44.864 --> 12:45.990
This is all your fault.

12:46.165 --> 12:50.158
"Ashley could never say no to you."
I told you I didn't like the cut of his jib.

12:50.336 --> 12:51.997
Now, are you gonna be
the bad cop or not?

12:52.171 --> 12:53.968
- Look, Carlton...
- Oh!

12:55.307 --> 12:59.300
Come here. Now listen, ain't nobody gonna
be no cop and ain't nobody going upstairs...

12:59.478 --> 13:02.003
...because we wasn't suppose to hear
what she said.

13:02.181 --> 13:05.412
Need I remind you there are demons
out there that go by the name of:

13:05.584 --> 13:08.075
Sexually transmitted diseases,
risk of pregnancy...

13:08.254 --> 13:11.189
...improper use of a condom?

13:11.490 --> 13:14.584
- You'd have us do nothing?
- I didn't say we ain't gonna do nothing.

13:14.760 --> 13:17.957
- Well, then what do you propose we do?
- You'll know as soon as I can figure out...

13:20.833 --> 13:22.801
- How y'all doing?
Hi.

13:22.968 --> 13:25.562
- Is Derek here yet?
- Oh.

13:25.738 --> 13:27.968
- He ain't coming.
- What?

13:28.140 --> 13:29.801
Yeah, it was...

13:29.975 --> 13:32.603
...a big accident, you know,
out on the 605.

13:32.778 --> 13:37.272
Yeah, a jackknifed big rig,
you know, spilled out a big load of, uh...

13:37.449 --> 13:39.144
Jackknives.

13:41.287 --> 13:44.381
- Hey, everybody, what's up?
- Hey! What's happening?

13:44.557 --> 13:47.424
Thank God you're alive.

13:47.893 --> 13:49.190
- We're gonna take off.
- Okay.

13:49.361 --> 13:50.828
- Have fun.
- See you, guys. Bye.

13:50.996 --> 13:53.157
I'm gonna go get a sweater.
I'll be right back.

13:53.332 --> 13:58.326
Yeah, Ashley, that's a good idea.
Go get a sweater. You know, to...

13:59.171 --> 14:00.832
- So, what's up, man?
- What's up, man?

14:01.006 --> 14:04.134
You think me and Carlton can have a word
with you for a second here?

14:04.310 --> 14:08.713
- What's going on?
- We're asking the questions here, pally.

14:09.315 --> 14:12.807
- So, Derek, you know about football?
- Yeah.

14:13.252 --> 14:16.983
Yeah, you do? Or, yeah, you don't?

14:20.593 --> 14:23.255
Are you familiar with the term "offsides"?

14:23.429 --> 14:26.057
Oh, yeah. That's when somebody
crosses the line too soon.

14:26.232 --> 14:28.393
Exactly.

14:28.567 --> 14:31.195
So I can see you know
what I'm talking about here then.

14:31.370 --> 14:32.564
No.

14:33.172 --> 14:35.868
No, you do?

14:36.375 --> 14:37.899
Or, no, you don't?

14:39.445 --> 14:41.072
Carlton.

14:41.847 --> 14:43.872
Let's put it this way.

14:44.650 --> 14:47.118
You're rounding third base
and you're headed for home.

14:47.286 --> 14:50.983
You're excited because you think you're
about to score easy. Here's the problem.

14:51.156 --> 14:54.023
You're in a visitor's ballpark
and if you do score...

14:54.193 --> 14:57.754
...the angry fans might not be able
to be held responsible for their actions.

14:58.163 --> 15:01.860
And it's bat night.

15:04.036 --> 15:07.199
All right, are you two in trouble
with a bookie or something?

15:07.373 --> 15:10.399
- Let's stop beating around the bush.
- Hey, man.

15:10.576 --> 15:14.012
You're playing chess, your rook
has been blindsided by the queen's gambit.

15:14.179 --> 15:18.047
You can play honorably, leave your bishop
at home but protect your queen's virtue...

15:18.217 --> 15:22.017
...or you can take the sleazy road and
castle your king and go right for the mate.

15:22.187 --> 15:26.055
And it's bat night.

15:26.225 --> 15:28.750
Do I make myself clear?

15:28.928 --> 15:30.623
Ready to go, Derek?
What's up?

15:30.796 --> 15:32.127
We were just saying hi.

15:32.298 --> 15:33.595
- Definitely. Let's go.
- Okay.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.098
Oh, Carlton?
Why don't you, uh, take Derek outside...

15:36.268 --> 15:40.136
...see if his lights and his horns is working
on the car? I'm gonna talk to Ashley.

15:40.706 --> 15:42.731
My lights? Wha...?

15:43.609 --> 15:45.304
Will, that's enough.
Now, what's going on?

15:46.679 --> 15:50.080
What's going on?
That's a very intelligent question, Ashley.

15:50.249 --> 15:52.740
"What's Going On."
That's a Marvin Gaye song too.

15:53.686 --> 15:55.415
Good night, Will.

15:55.587 --> 15:58.021
Ashley, no!

16:04.229 --> 16:06.322
Ashley, don't do it.

16:06.498 --> 16:08.591
Do what?

16:12.438 --> 16:15.134
Me and Carlton were roaming
on this stupid intercom...

16:15.307 --> 16:17.969
...and we roamed
right into your conversation...

16:18.143 --> 16:20.475
...and we heard what you said
about you and Derek.

16:21.313 --> 16:23.042
You were spying on me?

16:24.750 --> 16:28.345
Ashley, now spying,
that's such an ugly word.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.715
We were roaming.

16:30.889 --> 16:33.119
I can't believe
you guys invaded my privacy.

16:33.292 --> 16:34.316
Oh, but, Ashley...

16:34.493 --> 16:37.189
First of all,
how dare you listen to my conversation?

16:37.363 --> 16:39.456
Second of all, it is none of your business.

16:39.898 --> 16:41.695
- None of my business?
- Right.

16:41.867 --> 16:46.201
This is my life.
I decide what I do or don't do.

16:51.276 --> 16:55.736
You know,
I would expect this from Carlton...

16:56.782 --> 16:58.773
...but not you.

17:00.986 --> 17:02.317
Uh...

17:13.165 --> 17:16.099
You haven't said a word
all the way up here. Did I do something?

17:16.268 --> 17:18.361
Oh, no, no.

17:18.604 --> 17:20.595
So, what's going on?

17:20.906 --> 17:25.400
Carlton and Will listened to me and my
friends having a really private conversation.

17:25.577 --> 17:27.738
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

17:27.913 --> 17:31.474
They heard me saying some things
that I just didn't want them to hear.

17:31.650 --> 17:34.619
- Like what?
- Just some stuff.

17:34.787 --> 17:36.550
Well, what kind of stuff?

17:36.722 --> 17:39.247
Stuff about, um, me and you.

17:39.425 --> 17:40.585
Oh, good stuff?

17:41.193 --> 17:42.888
Yeah.

17:43.862 --> 17:47.195
They heard me telling my friends
that, um...

17:48.400 --> 17:52.234
That I wanted you to be my first.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.897
Did you mean that?

17:56.608 --> 17:58.803
You think you're ready?

18:00.312 --> 18:02.075
Well, if you are.

18:02.247 --> 18:04.511
- Are you?
- Sure. Uh...

18:09.855 --> 18:12.050
I guess.

18:13.459 --> 18:16.428
Ashley, it sounds to me
like you're not too sure.

18:17.029 --> 18:20.863
Well, does it bother you
that you're leaving tomorrow?

18:21.033 --> 18:23.024
Well, yeah.

18:23.535 --> 18:24.559
Does it bother you?

18:26.505 --> 18:28.803
I think it does.

18:29.675 --> 18:31.802
Would you rather not do this?

18:33.112 --> 18:38.209
I just never thought my first time would be
with someone who was leaving me.

18:38.417 --> 18:43.218
- What if we never see each other again?
- Ash, we'll see each other again.

18:45.491 --> 18:47.516
Then we really don't have to rush.

18:50.429 --> 18:52.397
I'm sorry.

18:57.836 --> 19:01.533
Baby, you don't have to apologize to me.

19:10.315 --> 19:13.751
So, heh, what do you wanna do now?

19:13.919 --> 19:16.581
I don't know. Miniature golf?

19:16.855 --> 19:17.879
Let's do it.

19:18.490 --> 19:20.014
Golf.

19:29.334 --> 19:31.495
- Ashley.
- Back off, Will.

19:31.670 --> 19:34.935
You telling me to back off, girl?
Hold up.

19:35.107 --> 19:37.075
Now, this is me.

19:37.242 --> 19:41.008
We always used to be able
to talk about anything.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.943
Talk.

19:44.750 --> 19:49.119
Well, you know, I just wanna say
that I'm sorry that we invaded your privacy.

19:49.288 --> 19:51.313
- I can't believe you did that.
- I know.

19:51.490 --> 19:53.082
I said it was wrong.

19:53.258 --> 19:58.195
It's just hard for me to accept the fact
that you're doing the...

19:58.363 --> 19:59.660
You know, that you're gonna be...

20:01.033 --> 20:02.057
...you know.

20:04.269 --> 20:06.499
I mean, I know you're cute, it's just that...

20:06.672 --> 20:11.473
- Will, let's just forget about it.
- Well, no. No. I can't forget about it.

20:11.643 --> 20:15.579
In my eyes, you still the little girl
that used to follow me around all the time.

20:16.582 --> 20:21.178
Now you wearing dresses
and got makeup and the whole nine.

20:22.354 --> 20:26.916
It's just... It makes me uncomfortable
to know that you're having...

20:27.259 --> 20:29.625
...a sex life.

20:31.863 --> 20:33.626
Fine. Be uncomfortable.

20:42.307 --> 20:44.775
Look, Will...

20:46.979 --> 20:49.413
...I didn't do anything.

20:53.585 --> 20:55.246
I mean...

20:55.454 --> 20:57.684
...I love Derek.

20:58.223 --> 21:00.282
And I thought I was ready...

21:00.459 --> 21:02.324
...but I'm not.

21:03.295 --> 21:07.129
You know, for a minute, just for a minute...

21:07.366 --> 21:09.527
...I forgot how smart you are.

21:11.536 --> 21:14.004
I guess I kind of panicked a little bit.

21:14.172 --> 21:17.903
Yeah. You remember the first time
I asked you about sex?

21:18.076 --> 21:19.941
You panicked then too.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.306
I did not.

21:21.480 --> 21:25.007
Yes, you did. You said that you needed
to have a license to have sex...

21:25.183 --> 21:28.846
...and that I couldn't even take the test
until I was 35.

21:30.455 --> 21:32.252
That's true.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.720
Well...

21:39.531 --> 21:43.467
...I guess it's not the worst thing in the
world to have a cousin who cares too much.

21:44.569 --> 21:46.434
All right, come here.

21:50.776 --> 21:54.234
<i>That was so beautiful.</i>
