WEBVTT

00:09.177 --> 00:10.944
- Remind me when I see Darrell
to give him a big hug.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.215
Just please don't
get in a pissing contest

00:14.248 --> 00:16.650
where you buy
every single one.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.819
- I just buy the good ones.
- Yeah, well.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.488
Your definition
and my definition of good

00:20.521 --> 00:22.290
sometimes is different.

00:22.323 --> 00:23.991
Oh, I just coughed up

00:24.024 --> 00:26.294
a big old loogie.
- Oh, gross!

00:26.327 --> 00:28.762
- It's a squishy one, too.
- Oh, my God,

00:28.796 --> 00:30.030
I don't need to know that.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.269
male announcer: When storage
units are abandoned...

00:35.303 --> 00:37.638
- Take a good look at this one.
- Whoo!

00:37.671 --> 00:39.140
announcer:
The treasures within...

00:39.173 --> 00:41.142
- I just want to know
what the heck this thing is.

00:41.175 --> 00:42.476
announcer:
Are put up for auction.

00:42.510 --> 00:43.811
- Yup!
- Sold it your way!

00:43.844 --> 00:45.513
- Whoo!
- Shazam!

00:45.546 --> 00:47.047
- You shut your face.

00:47.081 --> 00:49.217
- Oh, that's hot!
- Pop goes the weasel.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.384
- We're back, baby!

00:55.756 --> 00:58.726
- Hi, Casey, are you guys
headed to the auction today?

00:58.759 --> 01:00.428
Fabulous.

01:00.461 --> 01:01.929
If you show up, what?

01:01.962 --> 01:03.964
You want to show up
without shoes on?

01:03.997 --> 01:07.468
He said nude, sure.
Sure you can.

01:08.502 --> 01:11.805
Does he have a fever?
Oh, I'm so sorry, Rene.

01:11.839 --> 01:14.142
If you need to strip down,
hey, you know what?

01:14.175 --> 01:15.943
- Don't encourage that.
- I wouldn't mind it.

01:15.976 --> 01:18.946
You know, as long as
Casey doesn't get upset.

01:18.979 --> 01:20.348
It's going to be a good one.

01:20.381 --> 01:21.715
I say, come as you are.

01:21.749 --> 01:25.286
Healthy, sick, clothed, naked.
Just give me your money.

01:25.319 --> 01:27.188
Oh, look it,
they just hung up on me.

01:27.221 --> 01:29.457
- Yeah, just let it go.
- Poor guy's got a fever.

01:29.490 --> 01:31.892
He thinks he needs to strip
down to come to the sale.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.261
- I think he should
just stay home.

01:34.728 --> 01:37.298
- You know, I am
the king of Montebello,

01:37.331 --> 01:39.933
but I am gunning
for a smaller locker today.

01:39.967 --> 01:42.603
It'd be nice to find a nice,
little quaint, quiet,

01:42.636 --> 01:46.407
cool locker that I can
just enjoy myself with.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.775
It's not like the old days.
I don't have

01:47.808 --> 01:49.543
a ton of people helping me
move all this...

01:49.577 --> 01:52.813
Stuff.

01:52.846 --> 01:56.650
Sometimes,
it's rough being the king.

01:56.684 --> 01:57.718
They're going to want to see

01:57.751 --> 01:59.420
the king
get thrown off his throne.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.722
And that's not
going to be easy to do.

02:01.755 --> 02:04.392
- I've been waiting
on Montebello for weeks.

02:04.425 --> 02:07.127
They got a ton of rooms,
I got a ton of money.

02:07.161 --> 02:10.063
A ton of space.
Ooh, other buyers beware.

02:10.097 --> 02:13.601
Ivy wants more than one,
more than two, minimum three.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.603
Montebello doesn't need
a king anymore.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.805
It's time for Indiana Ivy.

02:17.838 --> 02:19.307
I'm conquering
the Temple of Rooms.

02:19.340 --> 02:20.741
Ha-ha!

02:20.774 --> 02:24.178
- And they have a ton of units.
- I know, I saw that.

02:24.212 --> 02:28.249
- I'm not getting lost today.
So I brought the Keyfinder.

02:28.282 --> 02:31.018
Boom, I get lost,
you get this...

02:32.220 --> 02:33.554
Now I know where you're at.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.223
*

02:35.256 --> 02:37.157
- That's...smart.

02:37.191 --> 02:38.526
So stupid.

02:38.559 --> 02:40.828
But hey, maybe we can
have a little fun, too.

02:40.861 --> 02:42.463
You want to put them
on the other buyers

02:42.496 --> 02:44.732
just to distract them?
- Maybe.

02:44.765 --> 02:48.168
- That'll piss them off.

02:48.202 --> 02:49.937
Top that!

02:49.970 --> 02:52.440
- Come on, folks!
Well, lookee here.

02:52.473 --> 02:55.809
She is driving! Danny!
He lets her drive.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.144
- What do you mean,
he lets her drive?

02:57.177 --> 02:58.312
- Well...
- She's saying

02:58.346 --> 02:59.580
you must not let her drive.
- Exactly.

02:59.613 --> 03:00.981
- She can drive
whenever she wants.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.883
You can drive every day.
From now on, you're the driver.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.985
Nope, it's done, it's settled.
Thank you.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.454
Do you have a cold?
- Yeah.

03:06.487 --> 03:07.821
- You ask somebody
if they got a cold,

03:07.855 --> 03:09.156
then you touch them.
Hey, hug Laura.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.091
- Oh, no.
Oh, no, no, no, no.

03:11.124 --> 03:13.126
- Hi, Danny!

03:14.662 --> 03:16.497
- What do you mean
what happened to me?

03:18.131 --> 03:20.334
Um...

03:20.368 --> 03:21.802
I'm a little--
I'm a little--

03:21.835 --> 03:23.304
I'm a little
flustered right now.

03:23.337 --> 03:25.506
- I don't know.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.808
- Hello, Danny.
- Hey, I'm flustered

03:27.841 --> 03:29.443
with you too.
- Go give him a hug.

03:29.477 --> 03:31.178
- We'd better
get this auction started

03:31.211 --> 03:33.847
before this crowd
gets just

03:33.881 --> 03:35.449
Welcome to the auction,
we're Dan and Laura Dodson,

03:35.483 --> 03:36.784
American Auctioneers,
and you know this guy.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.286
Before we
go through these gates,

03:38.319 --> 03:39.820
you need to know the rules.
We're going to go to the unit,

03:39.853 --> 03:41.355
we're going to remove the lock,
and we're going to give you

03:41.389 --> 03:42.590
five minutes
to take a look around.

03:42.623 --> 03:44.658
You can't go inside,
you can't open any boxes,

03:44.692 --> 03:46.226
and whosever's got
the most money in their pocket

03:46.260 --> 03:47.661
can own it today,
are you ready?

03:47.695 --> 03:49.397
- Let's do it, whoo!

03:49.430 --> 03:51.365
- Let's go!
- All right, Montebello,

03:51.399 --> 03:53.434
let's go!

03:53.467 --> 03:55.836
- I'm going to clip this
on Darrell's keys.

03:55.869 --> 03:57.605
- Okay.
- Sneakily.

03:57.638 --> 04:00.708
We have one target:
the Queen of Montebello.

04:00.741 --> 04:03.477
Might have to do like,
where you bump him.

04:04.712 --> 04:08.349
All right,
here we go, Montebello.

04:08.382 --> 04:10.718
Corner unit.

04:10.751 --> 04:13.053
Don't let
that mattress scare you.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.322
Go ahead, take a look
and look it over,

04:14.355 --> 04:15.689
don't overlook anything,
you've got to, come on,

04:15.723 --> 04:17.525
if you're here to buy,
let's get this thing rocking.

04:17.558 --> 04:19.059
Come on now, here we go.

04:20.461 --> 04:22.296
- Oh, Brandi.

04:22.330 --> 04:24.064
I thought you didn't like me.

04:28.969 --> 04:31.271
- Well, they bought boxes,
which make me like it,

04:31.305 --> 04:33.507
but we got this
giant mattress up front.

04:33.541 --> 04:36.810
Mattresses, why did it
have to be mattresses?

04:36.844 --> 04:38.512
Sometimes, you've just got to
wait on the good ones.

04:39.813 --> 04:42.249
- Microphone stand.
- I like this.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.051
It's like a jewelry box thing.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.052
I'm not missing him.

04:45.085 --> 04:46.854
- Walk in closet,
and two shoes.

04:46.887 --> 04:48.589
Two shoes!

04:48.622 --> 04:50.324
The question is,
are they two matching shoes?

04:50.358 --> 04:51.525
I don't know.

04:53.327 --> 04:55.228
- Hey, if it's
wrapped in plastic,

04:55.262 --> 04:56.430
it's got to be fantastic.

04:56.464 --> 04:58.198
- It's all boxes
behind the mattress.

04:58.231 --> 04:59.933
- Yeah.

04:59.967 --> 05:02.903
- Look at the tool chest.
- Sound equipment right there.

05:02.936 --> 05:05.305
I like this unit.
Everything is clean.

05:05.339 --> 05:08.208
There's probably
about 20, 25 boxes in there.

05:08.241 --> 05:09.677
- All right, everyone, we're
going to start this thing.

05:09.710 --> 05:11.078
Here we go, number 20,
what's your pleasure,

05:11.111 --> 05:12.446
what are you going to pay
and say, how much money where?

05:12.480 --> 05:13.481
- 100!
- I've got 100 there.

05:13.514 --> 05:14.848
Moving to 200, where?
- Yeah.

05:16.249 --> 05:17.785
300 there, take it to 400.
- 400.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.387
- 400 dollars there, 450.
- Yeah.

05:19.420 --> 05:20.854
- It's going to be 400,
it's going to be 500.

05:20.888 --> 05:22.222
600, and 600. 650.

05:22.255 --> 05:23.391
I'm going to
take the bid to 700,

05:23.424 --> 05:24.858
- Yeah!

05:24.892 --> 05:26.193
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

05:26.226 --> 05:27.361
- Yeah!

05:27.395 --> 05:28.529
925, 925, now the bid
is at 950--

05:28.562 --> 05:29.930
- Yeah!
- 950, 1000, I'm looking at--

05:29.963 --> 05:31.732
- 975!
- I got 975.

05:31.765 --> 05:33.333
1000 bucks, 1000.

05:33.367 --> 05:35.268
$1000 going once,
$1000 going twice,

05:35.302 --> 05:36.370
Last and final call--

05:36.404 --> 05:38.038
- Looking for
$100 a box in there.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.840
- Sold that your way, Jarrod,
you got it for 975,

05:39.873 --> 05:41.174
Jarrod and Brandi.

05:41.208 --> 05:42.443
- We're going to go
through this right now.

05:42.476 --> 05:44.712
'Cause we can always
find the crowd later.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.481
- Whoo!
- Right here.

05:47.515 --> 05:50.183
- No, right here.
That's Gucci, honey.

05:50.217 --> 05:52.285
We can probably get
300 or 400 bucks for that.

05:52.319 --> 05:53.621
- Yeah.

05:53.654 --> 05:54.922
- Okay.
- This bag,

05:54.955 --> 05:58.592
can probably get 80 bucks for.
- Okay. Whoa!

05:58.626 --> 06:02.630
What is this?

06:02.663 --> 06:04.532
- I don't have any idea.

06:04.565 --> 06:06.400
What is this?
- It's a Swash.

06:06.434 --> 06:08.235
- It's whirlpool.

06:08.268 --> 06:09.637
I think you can press
your clothes in there.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.972
That's awesome.
Swash system...

06:12.005 --> 06:14.174
I think we can get about
300 bucks for this thing.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.910
- Here's a blender, babe.
Like, one of those good ones.

06:16.944 --> 06:19.747
Yeah, 250.

06:19.780 --> 06:22.349
- Check this box.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.718
What'd you get?
- Oh.

06:24.752 --> 06:26.487
It's a decanter,
and it's Tiffany.

06:26.520 --> 06:27.855
- Ooh.
- We can get

06:27.888 --> 06:30.390
100 bucks for this.
- Here, this is a jewelry box.

06:30.424 --> 06:31.992
Keep it going.
- This is all

06:32.025 --> 06:34.562
Tiffany jewelry, Jay.
worth money.

06:34.595 --> 06:37.197
- $500 worth of jewelry
in here, Jarrod.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.467
The Tiffany stuff
always holds its value.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.570
- 'Cause it's too expensive
to begin with.

06:42.603 --> 06:45.506
- Oh, it's got, how cute!
50 bucks for that.

06:45.539 --> 06:48.542
- Yeah, yeah!

06:48.576 --> 06:49.943
100 bucks for the amp.

06:49.977 --> 06:52.179
Should get the band
back together.

06:52.212 --> 06:53.481
I'll play bass.

06:53.514 --> 06:55.816
And drums, and sing,
and keyboard,

06:55.849 --> 06:58.151
so really, I don't
even need you.

06:58.185 --> 07:00.654
What is that?

07:00.688 --> 07:02.856
Play a little ditty.

07:02.890 --> 07:06.494
- Oh, it's a flute.
- Ooh.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.228
Set it aside so it doesn't
get messed up.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.530
- It's fancy.
- Let's definitely

07:09.563 --> 07:12.065
get that checked out.
Here, oh, look at this.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.001
- Open it.
- Maybe we can get it

07:14.034 --> 07:16.436
checked out at a bar,
with the band.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.238
That would count
as a date, too.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.107
- Not everything counts
as a date, okay?

07:20.140 --> 07:21.775
Taking the kids
to school together

07:21.809 --> 07:23.777
does not count as a date.

07:23.811 --> 07:26.680
- That counts as a date!

07:26.714 --> 07:29.116
Here, bunny, bunny, bunny!

07:29.149 --> 07:30.383
Yeah, we're done.

07:30.417 --> 07:31.952
I wonder where
everyone else is?

07:33.654 --> 07:36.423
- Come on, now,
let's see what's inside here.

07:36.456 --> 07:37.858
Money in there!

07:37.891 --> 07:39.760
*

07:42.229 --> 07:43.897
- Dude, what's up

07:43.931 --> 07:45.298
with the annoying beeping?

07:45.332 --> 07:47.434
- Well, some dishes.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.436
Looks like we got
a barbecue pit back there.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.738
There's a little bit
of money in here.

07:50.771 --> 07:53.273
I'll bid a little bit,
but I won't go too far.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.477
- Nope.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.717
Something in this locker?

08:03.751 --> 08:05.352
- Ooh, you think
there's weights for that?

08:05.385 --> 08:07.187
- Probably, yeah,
it's a guy's unit.

08:07.220 --> 08:09.790
But I don't think I want it.
- I'm good.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.224
- Oh, the rug looks nice.

08:11.258 --> 08:13.060
There's fishing poles
back there.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.828
The weight bar.
- Looks like low end stuff,

08:14.862 --> 08:16.096
to be honest.

08:16.129 --> 08:18.398
- Got some glasses,
we got some DVDs.

08:18.431 --> 08:21.001
Mid-century dresser,
and stuff like that.

08:21.034 --> 08:22.469
Might be for me.

08:24.672 --> 08:26.139
Oh--

08:26.173 --> 08:28.408
That's you beeping.
- That's you beeping.

08:28.441 --> 08:30.443
- It's not me, honest to God.

08:30.477 --> 08:31.712
- All righty, here we go,
number 20,

08:31.745 --> 08:32.880
what's your pleasure?
What are you going to pay

08:32.913 --> 08:34.247
and say, how much money where?
- 50!

08:34.281 --> 08:35.515
- We can put 50, 75 now.
- Yeah!

08:35.549 --> 08:36.984
- 50 bucks, 75,
we're looking for 100,

08:37.017 --> 08:38.952
we're looking for 125,
125 and 100--

08:38.986 --> 08:40.420
- Yeah!
- Bidding's at 175.

08:40.453 --> 08:42.322
150, 175, now 200, 200,
looking for 200,

08:42.355 --> 08:44.291
looking for the 200, there,
and 225, 225,

08:44.324 --> 08:46.526
going to bid 225,
looking to bid 250 there.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.361
- 275.
- Going for 300.

08:48.395 --> 08:49.697
Looking for 300, where?

08:49.730 --> 08:51.932
300 going once, twice,

08:51.965 --> 08:54.401
Sold that your way, Ivy.
Got it for 275, Ivy.

08:54.434 --> 08:57.270
I came here
to go on a buying crusade.

08:57.304 --> 08:58.538
So that's what I'm going to do.

08:58.572 --> 09:01.508
- All right, come on out!

09:01.541 --> 09:02.676
- That's kind of cool
right there,

09:02.710 --> 09:04.277
that little tool rolling chest.

09:04.311 --> 09:05.345
- Here we go, number 20,
little tool unit,

09:05.378 --> 09:06.614
Starting the bid--
- 100!

09:06.647 --> 09:07.881
- I got 100 bucks,
moving the bidding to 125,

09:07.915 --> 09:08.949
does anybody
want to go to there?

09:08.982 --> 09:10.851
- 200!

09:10.884 --> 09:13.320
Sold it your way,
250 bucks, Ivy, thank you.

09:13.353 --> 09:14.988
- All right now!

09:15.022 --> 09:16.056
- I could always
use fishing poles.

09:16.089 --> 09:17.424
- All right, here we go,
number 20,

09:17.457 --> 09:18.659
What are you going to pay?
Are you going to do 15?

09:18.692 --> 09:19.827
- 20.
- 15, you want to bid 20.

09:19.860 --> 09:20.828
- Sold it your way,
20 big ones, Ivy.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.462
- Yee-haw!

09:22.495 --> 09:26.667
I'm like that big old boulder,
mowing everybody down.

09:31.739 --> 09:33.373
- All right, whoa!

09:33.406 --> 09:35.743
- All right,
one of the better ones.

09:37.144 --> 09:38.812
- There's a lot of stuff
in this one.

09:38.846 --> 09:41.548
Lot of boxes, man.
Couple of nice bikes.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.516
We'll see what it goes.

09:43.550 --> 09:46.019
- Uh...
- Treadmill.

09:46.053 --> 09:48.155
- The springs
off someone's car.

09:48.188 --> 09:50.090
Ladder, ladder.

09:50.123 --> 09:52.826
I could finally
climb my way to the top.

09:52.860 --> 09:55.629
- If only the key fob could
find better jokes for Jarrod.

09:55.663 --> 09:57.464
Give it to me.

09:57.497 --> 09:58.832
- Where's that beeping

09:58.866 --> 10:00.768
coming from?
I've been hearing it all day.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.805
- There's a treadmill,
there you go.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.006
It's the unit for you.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.274
- I don't do treadmills.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.743
But you know, every box,
DVDs, DVDs, DVDs.

10:09.777 --> 10:11.144
- This looks
really good, actually.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.546
- I don't know.
It has potential.

10:13.580 --> 10:15.148
But it's potentially
a lot of work.

10:15.182 --> 10:16.750
I don't feel up to it.

10:16.784 --> 10:19.252
- Hey, DVDs sell.
Even crappy DVDs sell.

10:19.286 --> 10:22.255
- Oh, my goodness.
Got a bike in there.

10:22.289 --> 10:25.092
Nice freezer, I don't know.
I've got to think about it.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.494
That's a lot of, lot of,
lot of work right here.

10:28.796 --> 10:29.830
- All right,
I already got 200.

10:29.863 --> 10:31.098
Looking at 200,
want to bid 300.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.165
Want to bid 300, there,
moving the bidding

10:32.199 --> 10:33.500
to 300
What about 400?

10:33.533 --> 10:35.335
What about 500, what about 500,
what about 500?

10:35.368 --> 10:37.971
And 600,
600 there, and 700 where?

10:38.005 --> 10:39.773
Want to bid 700, right there.
Moving to 800, moving to 900,

10:39.807 --> 10:41.174
We're looking for 900, where?
You have to bid 900.

10:41.208 --> 10:42.609
Moving to 1000, we're
looking for 1000, where?

10:42.642 --> 10:44.111
- That one counts.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.545
- I got 1000.
- Little more.

10:45.578 --> 10:46.847
- 1100 now, 1200,
I'm going to bid 1200,

10:46.880 --> 10:48.481
I'm looking for 1300 now.
- Stop it.

10:48.515 --> 10:49.917
I'm looking at 1300.

10:49.950 --> 10:52.285
- Casey thinks this locker
is what dreams are made of.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.623
I think it's what
fever dreams are made of.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.325
- Come on, Casey!
2400, now 2500,

10:58.358 --> 11:00.260
Looking to bid 2600, and 2600,
going up to 2700,

11:00.293 --> 11:02.595
I got 2700, going to bid 2800,
want to bid 2900,

11:02.629 --> 11:03.831
- Crazy, don't bid anymore.

11:03.864 --> 11:06.900
No, stop it.
Seriously.

11:06.934 --> 11:08.902
- To 3000, looking for 3100,
I got 3000 bucks.

11:08.936 --> 11:10.738
3100, I got 3100,
I'm moving to 3200.

11:10.771 --> 11:12.539
I got 3100.
- Yeah, yeah.

11:12.572 --> 11:14.007
3200, now 3300,
moving the bidding to 3300.

11:14.041 --> 11:15.342
- Don't bid, stop it.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.210
- 3400, I got 3300.
She's in, leave her alone.

11:17.244 --> 11:18.578
- She's not in.
- Yes, she is.

11:18.611 --> 11:20.013
- She ain't got no money.
- She's got 3300.

11:20.047 --> 11:21.314
Moving to 3400,
I've got two bids.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.316
I've got 3300.
3400.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.318
3400?
Looking to bid 3500 now.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.920
- I've got 3400.

11:26.954 --> 11:28.155
I'm looking for 3500.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.857
Looking for 3500,
and 3400, I've got 3500,

11:29.890 --> 11:32.125
and 3600, I've got 3600.
3700, 3700, I've got 3700.

11:32.159 --> 11:34.027
I've got 3700, 3800,
3700, 3800,

11:34.061 --> 11:36.063
3700 going once,
3700 going twice,

11:36.096 --> 11:37.865
Last and final call.

11:37.898 --> 11:41.334
Sold that your way, Casey.
You got it for 3700!

11:41.368 --> 11:43.503
- Rene has a fever.
He's not thinking clearly.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.105
This is a great locker.

11:45.138 --> 11:47.941
- 3700, baby.
- For about $1800 worth

11:47.975 --> 11:50.010
of merchandise.
- Whoo!

11:50.043 --> 11:52.946
Thank you very much
for paying the lady!

11:52.980 --> 11:55.548
- He already goes out,
let me tell you about that bid.

11:55.582 --> 11:57.417
- He really had me confused
for a while.

11:57.450 --> 11:59.052
I was like...

11:59.086 --> 12:00.187
The last time I checked,

12:00.220 --> 12:02.422
the king didn't ask
for any

12:02.455 --> 12:03.891
gestures in his kingdom.

12:03.924 --> 12:06.193
Is it a joke, then?
- No, it's a Keyfinder.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.896
We put it on your keys for you.
I was just being nice.

12:08.929 --> 12:11.131
- They got me.

12:12.532 --> 12:13.934
- All right.
- All right.

12:13.967 --> 12:17.370
Whole bag of clothes.
Right here's at least 30 bucks.

12:21.541 --> 12:24.277
Dude, we spent $3700.
Don't be throwing stuff.

12:24.311 --> 12:25.879
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
let's get something right.

12:25.913 --> 12:30.017
You spent $3700, I was like,
don't bet, don't bid--

12:32.986 --> 12:34.021
Oh, man.

12:34.054 --> 12:37.324
Welding tank and cart,
60 bucks.

12:37.357 --> 12:41.361
$40 ladder.
Another $40 ladder.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.296
This welding tank right here,
that should be $100.

12:43.330 --> 12:45.032
It's like...

12:47.767 --> 12:50.904
- Inflatable throwable device,
life raft, that's cool.

12:50.938 --> 12:54.507
Pull it.
- Oh, my God.

12:54.541 --> 12:56.176
- Oh, it's just a pad.

12:56.209 --> 12:57.577
You said it was a raft.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.482
, I need a
life vest for this locker.

13:02.515 --> 13:05.352
That's what this is.
- My buy is not that bad.

13:05.385 --> 13:07.855
- It's fricking terrible
right now.

13:07.888 --> 13:10.891
- I'm afraid...

13:12.893 --> 13:14.862
- That's got to be
worth some money, right?

13:14.895 --> 13:17.297
50 bucks.
Good, movies.

13:17.330 --> 13:21.368
$2.99, four for ten bucks.
- That's 200 bucks.

13:21.401 --> 13:25.172
- More DVDs.
- This box is another 200.

13:25.205 --> 13:26.506
That's another $200.

13:26.539 --> 13:29.442
- See, we're slowly
getting there.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.811
- Yeah, well you're not going
to have 40 boxes like that.

13:33.413 --> 13:37.084
Rescue platform.
To inflate, pull handle.

13:37.117 --> 13:38.451
We're not doing this this time.

13:38.485 --> 13:39.686
But this could be
really good, actually.

13:39.719 --> 13:42.289
- Oh, so this could
possibly be good?

13:42.322 --> 13:43.790
- No.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.225
- It's the best thing
I've seen so far.

13:45.258 --> 13:48.061
This locker literally threw us
a life ring to save us.

13:48.095 --> 13:49.897
- That's a nice bike, mister.

13:51.398 --> 13:53.433
- Just because the bike
is called Big Ripper

13:53.466 --> 13:55.268
doesn't mean
you have to rip one!

13:55.302 --> 13:57.570
- I was thinking we get
500 bucks for the bike.

13:57.604 --> 13:59.272
Probably get a couple
hundred bucks for that.

13:59.306 --> 14:01.641
There's DVD's,
that's another $200.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.610
- Nice.
- Garbage.

14:03.643 --> 14:06.179
- Oh, a gumball machine.
- Eh, 40 bucks.

14:06.213 --> 14:08.648
Another box of DVDs, 200 bucks.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.183
- Nice.
- CDs boxes,

14:10.217 --> 14:11.784
probably 150 bucks.
- Oh.

14:11.818 --> 14:16.924
- Xbox 360, 50 bucks.
This is another $200, easy.

14:16.957 --> 14:20.427
Probably down there are another
50, 60 boxes I haven't seen.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.762
Let's just say, average out,
what do you think.

14:22.795 --> 14:24.764
20 bucks a box?

14:24.797 --> 14:27.400
This is another 1000 bucks.

14:27.434 --> 14:30.037
This may be the locker
that kills me.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.171
I think you just

14:31.204 --> 14:32.539
extended my cold
by like, a year.

14:32.572 --> 14:35.008
- Sorry.

14:37.777 --> 14:39.079
- Hope you ate your Wheaties.

14:39.112 --> 14:41.214
After cracking the whip
on the competition,

14:41.248 --> 14:43.250
Ivy Jr. and I picked up
the three lockers.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.352
And we're back at Grandma's
Attic to go through them.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.622
The only value in this
is holding the door open.

14:49.656 --> 14:52.559
Welp, whoo!

14:52.592 --> 14:54.161
It ain't even
valuable for that.

14:55.628 --> 14:56.763
- And check this.

14:59.799 --> 15:01.701
*

15:01.734 --> 15:03.203
- Good for the time being.
- I agree.

15:03.236 --> 15:04.504
- Let's just take
all the smalls out,

15:04.537 --> 15:06.173
and sort them accordingly.

15:06.206 --> 15:07.941
Cool little kitchen thing.

15:07.975 --> 15:11.178
Tools, clothes,
an ugly little table.

15:11.211 --> 15:12.745
We've got some gold here.

15:12.779 --> 15:14.814
Little bit of silver,
gold right there.

15:14.847 --> 15:17.050
300 bucks in gold right here.

15:17.084 --> 15:19.052
- More clothes.
- Aw, man.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.887
Can't you find anything cool?

15:20.920 --> 15:25.725
- Pots, pans, kitchenware.
- Furniture.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.094
Whoo, look at
all that thread.

15:27.127 --> 15:28.095
These are run flats.

15:28.128 --> 15:30.430
I can at least get 100
for them.

15:30.463 --> 15:33.566
Ooh, wow, bigger run flats.
200 bucks.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.969
Sometimes, you buy units,
and you hit it big.

15:36.003 --> 15:38.338
But these are just
pay-the-bills units.

15:38.371 --> 15:39.639
Pull me up, big son.

15:39.672 --> 15:42.575
Get up in there
and see what we got.

15:42.609 --> 15:45.245
Ooh, this a big old reel here.
10 bucks on that one.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.613
Old Iowa.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.581
The rug right here,
this is a nice, big rug.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.417
Seven footer?
- I'd say almost eight.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.918
- 50 bucks.
I'll get at least

15:51.951 --> 15:55.155
45 bucks for that jack.
Ooh, air condition.

15:55.188 --> 15:56.956
50 bucks.
This canopy right here

15:56.990 --> 15:58.558
has got to be worth
at least 60 bucks.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.760
One, two, three,
four fishing poles.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.729
100 bucks right there.
- All right.

16:02.762 --> 16:04.331
- Whoo!
That was a lot of crap.

16:04.364 --> 16:07.567
100 bucks in clothes,
600 bucks in tools,

16:07.600 --> 16:10.437
About, uh, 600, 700 bucks
of just furniture

16:10.470 --> 16:12.372
and all kinds of
miscellaneous Christmas crap.

16:12.405 --> 16:14.307
- Heck, yeah.
- Let's go get lunch.

16:14.341 --> 16:19.746
- I'm down.
- You drive and I'll buy.

16:21.848 --> 16:24.151
- Yeah, and some--

16:24.184 --> 16:25.718
- And Jameson.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.287
- We think these instruments
are Irish.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.521
So we're taking them
to a musician,

16:28.555 --> 16:30.323
Patrick Darcy,
to have them looked at.

16:30.357 --> 16:32.325
And maybe have a pint.

16:32.359 --> 16:34.261
Hi.

16:34.294 --> 16:35.795
What are you playing there?

16:35.828 --> 16:37.764
- These are
the Irish uilleann pipes.

16:37.797 --> 16:41.000
And they are the traditional
bagpipe of Ireland.

16:41.034 --> 16:43.303
- They don't look like the
bagpipes I've seen in movies.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.704
- Exactly, yeah.
A lot of the times,

16:44.737 --> 16:46.639
you'll see highland pipes,
the Scottish pipes.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.175
But you'll hear these
on the soundtrack.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.543
- Do you have to sit
to play that, is that why?

16:50.577 --> 16:51.778
- Yeah, exactly.
- Okay.

16:51.811 --> 16:54.347
So, here's what we've got.

16:54.381 --> 16:58.718
Some sort of drum,
and this thing.

16:58.751 --> 17:01.188
- Oh, yeah,
that's a lovely instrument.

17:01.221 --> 17:03.790
This is boxwood.
Beautiful wood for flutes,

17:03.823 --> 17:05.325
and it's still in good shape.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.659
Like, that's still
sliding well

17:06.693 --> 17:07.827
and all that kind of thing.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.862
But it looks like
it's made by Sam Murray,

17:09.896 --> 17:12.599
who's a great Irish
flute maker from Belfast

17:12.632 --> 17:13.900
in the north of Ireland.
- Oh, yeah, Sam.

17:13.933 --> 17:15.768
- Yeah, you know Sam.
Everybody knows Sam.

17:15.802 --> 17:17.604
But um, let's see if it works.

17:17.637 --> 17:19.572
Usually, they take
a bit of warming up.

17:23.076 --> 17:26.613
- No comment.

17:35.021 --> 17:38.758
Yeah, that's a beautiful flute.

17:38.791 --> 17:40.827
- The drum, yeah.
So this is a bodhrán.

17:40.860 --> 17:42.395
It is the Irish drum

17:42.429 --> 17:43.996
that's supposed to sound
like a heartbeat.

17:44.030 --> 17:45.698
So let's see what
this one sounds like.

17:47.267 --> 17:49.302
So that's pretty high.
- Hmm.

17:49.336 --> 17:52.539
Whereas with this,
you'd normally play it...

17:52.572 --> 17:53.840
Like...

17:54.774 --> 17:56.276
- Oh, that has a
totally different sound.

17:56.309 --> 17:59.412
- Yeah.
- So, our drum is not amazing.

17:59.446 --> 18:01.114
- Well, it's nicely made.

18:01.148 --> 18:02.982
You know, it's a nice
quality wood and everything.

18:03.015 --> 18:05.752
There's no name stamp
that I can see.

18:05.785 --> 18:09.489
So this would be valued
kind of in the, like,

18:09.522 --> 18:13.760
$100 kind of range.
You know, something like that.

18:13.793 --> 18:17.130
- And how about the, uh...
- The flute is a lovely flute.

18:17.164 --> 18:20.233
They don't depreciate in value,
this quality of an instrument.

18:20.267 --> 18:22.635
They'll just kind of maintain,
or even go up

18:22.669 --> 18:24.771
if they become rare, you know?
- Right.

18:24.804 --> 18:27.407
- So, I'd say you could
probably sell this for...

18:29.942 --> 18:33.180
Maybe something like...

18:33.213 --> 18:35.315
2,000.
- Wow.

18:35.348 --> 18:37.984
That's a score.
- $2,000.

18:38.017 --> 18:39.118
That might be enough money

18:39.152 --> 18:40.553
to get Jarrod
to dance an Irish jig.

18:42.789 --> 18:45.024
Probably not.

18:48.695 --> 18:51.130
- Let's do this.
This thing is way too heavy.

18:51.164 --> 18:53.132
Casey and I
are at Avalon Rafts.

18:53.166 --> 18:55.502
Let's see if we're
going to sink or swim.

18:55.535 --> 18:57.337
- Um, what you have
is a rescue platform

18:57.370 --> 18:59.105
from the Switlik
life raft company.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.407
Probably ten person.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.409
- Ten full sized men,
or like...

19:03.543 --> 19:04.611
- Mm-hmm.
- Somebody's in the water.

19:04.644 --> 19:05.878
- This one looks like

19:05.912 --> 19:08.014
it hasn't been serviced
in quite some time.

19:08.047 --> 19:11.117
The only way to really tell if
it's any good is to open it.

19:11.150 --> 19:14.354
And if we do open it,
then I can't close it back up

19:14.387 --> 19:16.589
unless it's recertified.

19:16.623 --> 19:18.791
- That could be anywhere
from $500 to $700,

19:18.825 --> 19:20.360
with the testing
and everything done.

19:20.393 --> 19:22.329
- And how much
would it be worth then?

19:22.362 --> 19:25.265
- Um, about the service.

19:25.298 --> 19:26.999
Maybe a little bit more.
- It's not good

19:27.033 --> 19:28.801
to invest 700 to make 100,
that is really bad business.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.737
- Yeah, I understand,
that's, uh...

19:30.770 --> 19:32.539
- What if I sold it as is,
just like it is.

19:32.572 --> 19:33.973
I'm like, hey, look,
it's not certified.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.074
We know nothing about it,

19:35.107 --> 19:36.509
you need to go
get it certified.

19:36.543 --> 19:38.110
- Um...

19:41.113 --> 19:42.782
Maybe $100, if that.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.584
- That's actually
the same amount of profit

19:44.617 --> 19:46.319
if I don't invest 700.
- It is.

19:46.353 --> 19:48.321
- So can we blow
one of these up now?

19:48.355 --> 19:51.658
- This is your activation line,
so give it a good, hard,

19:51.691 --> 19:54.361
swift--

20:00.400 --> 20:02.302
Yep, no padding,
I'm just all floor.

20:04.371 --> 20:06.773
announcer: Brandi and Jarrod
hit all the right notes,

20:06.806 --> 20:09.676
orchestrating 2,900 bucks.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.945
Indiana Ivy
whipped up $1,800 dollars

20:12.979 --> 20:14.714
on his buying crusade.

20:14.747 --> 20:17.116
Darrell Sheets got .

20:17.149 --> 20:21.688
While Casey took the helm,
and nearly sunk Rene.

20:23.623 --> 20:25.758
- Yeah, he's sick.

20:25.792 --> 20:30.730
- Some people might say a lot.

20:30.763 --> 20:33.300
- Would you, like, be a buffer
between me and him, please?

20:33.333 --> 20:34.501
'Cause I just don't need it.

20:34.534 --> 20:36.102
I got 50 bucks.

20:36.135 --> 20:38.471
Bidding at 75.
75 where?

20:40.407 --> 20:43.009
- I think it went in my eye.

20:43.042 --> 20:44.944
- Number one sign of a guy
in the business, right here.

20:44.977 --> 20:46.178
- I don't want to be sick.

20:48.147 --> 20:51.351
- Okay, and that's
my cue to leave.

20:51.384 --> 20:53.953
Wow.
