I'm worried this Collin thing

00:08.083 --> 00:09.615
might be more than
just a fantasy.

the sadness of doing something

08:09.530 --> 08:10.763
Ooh, come sit with me.

08:10.765 --> 08:11.630
- Okay.

08:11.632 --> 08:17.203
[Cell phones chiming
and ringing]

08:17.771 --> 08:21.273
- OMFG,
can we all please focus?

08:21.275 --> 08:22.975
This forever is going to be
a never

08:22.977 --> 08:26.412
if we don't get this together!

08:26.414 --> 08:27.880
Class rankings?

08:27.882 --> 08:29.582
How did this get out?

08:29.584 --> 08:30.849
This wiki-leaking is going to

08:30.851 --> 08:32.651
cause serious wiki-tweaking.

08:32.653 --> 08:33.385
[Gasps]

08:33.387 --> 08:34.653
I'm 17!
Oh, thank God.

08:34.655 --> 08:37.489
Tufts and Brandeis are
totally in my ballpark!

08:37.491 --> 08:39.592
Or maybe I'll reach
for U. Penn.

08:39.594 --> 08:41.727
Or Princeton or--wait.

08:41.729 --> 08:42.728
Jenna, where are you?

08:42.730 --> 08:45.030
- Sadie's number three.
Yuck.

08:45.032 --> 08:45.965
Jake's 19.

08:45.967 --> 08:47.199
- I wish our closeness in rank

08:47.201 --> 08:48.901
carried over
into our relationship.

08:48.903 --> 08:51.036
Oh, look. There's Fred.
Not bad.

08:51.038 --> 08:52.438
And Matty--whoa!

08:52.440 --> 08:54.206
He is way higher
than I thought.

08:54.208 --> 08:55.207
Check it out, Jenna.

08:55.209 --> 08:57.109
- Okay, but where am I?
Why am I not on here?

08:57.111 --> 09:00.079
- Maybe you're
on the next page.

09:00.081 --> 09:04.550
Or the next one.

09:04.552 --> 09:06.118
- Oh, my God.

09:06.120 --> 09:07.886
- It's not that bad.

09:07.888 --> 09:09.688
- T, I'm 137!

09:09.690 --> 09:12.291
- Now smile.

09:13.727 --> 09:14.760
[Camera shutter clicks]

09:14.762 --> 09:16.996
- Not a pretty picture.

09:19.232 --> 09:20.232
- [Laughs]

09:20.234 --> 09:21.100
I'm sorry.

09:21.102 --> 09:22.534
I thought you were
pulling my leg.

09:22.536 --> 09:25.037
I guess it's involuntary
muscle twitching.

09:25.039 --> 09:26.138
Say it again.

09:26.140 --> 09:27.072
- College?

09:27.074 --> 09:29.575
- Huh...
Oh, Jenna.

09:29.577 --> 09:31.277
Do you really think
that you have

09:31.279 --> 09:32.745
a chance at getting
into college

09:32.747 --> 09:34.580
with your low class rank?

09:34.582 --> 09:36.148
With your 139?

09:36.150 --> 09:37.750
- 137.
- Oh, excuse me.

09:37.752 --> 09:39.218
Let's get M.I.T.
On the phone.

09:39.220 --> 09:41.420
- Aren't you supposed
to be helping?

09:41.422 --> 09:42.554
- Whoa, I am, J.

09:42.556 --> 09:43.856
It's called tough love,

09:43.858 --> 09:45.024
and I'm one tough lover.

09:45.026 --> 09:47.259
Okay, let's start
with your complete lack

09:47.261 --> 09:49.795
of participation
in just about everything,

09:49.797 --> 09:52.264
and your embarrassing
S.A.T. Score?

09:52.266 --> 09:54.566
Though, in your defense,
you were stoned.

09:54.568 --> 09:55.868
- It was just one bad semester.

09:55.870 --> 09:58.604
- Okay, I don't know
who our wiki-leaker is.

09:58.606 --> 09:59.605
I will hunt him down

09:59.607 --> 10:01.106
and smoke him
out of his foxhole,

10:01.108 --> 10:03.976
but I actually think he--
or she, or zhe--

10:03.978 --> 10:06.945
I'm trying out some gender
neutral pronouns this year.

10:06.947 --> 10:09.815
Anyway, I think they may have
done you a favor

10:09.817 --> 10:11.583
by giving you
a reality check.

10:11.585 --> 10:13.185
I mean, even Ming got
her act together,

10:13.187 --> 10:14.987
going off to Arizona
to boarding school,

10:14.989 --> 10:16.822
so she can get into
a decent college.

10:16.824 --> 10:17.790
- It's in Vermont.

10:17.792 --> 10:19.425
- [Whispers]
I heard Iowa.

10:19.427 --> 10:20.492
Maybe they relocated her.

10:20.494 --> 10:21.927
- Who?
- [Whispers] The Asian Mafia.

10:21.929 --> 10:26.999
All we got was a letter
from her parents and this.

10:27.001 --> 10:30.369
[Suspenseful music]

10:30.371 --> 10:32.004
Jenna.

10:32.006 --> 10:33.505
Let's talk about
your brand.

10:33.507 --> 10:35.040
- My brand?
- It's your only shot

10:35.042 --> 10:37.042
at piquing a college's interest.

10:37.044 --> 10:38.143
I know what my brand is--

10:38.145 --> 10:39.978
empathetic hipster
with deep thoughts

10:39.980 --> 10:43.582
and distractingly sexy legs
who spoons out so much sugar

10:43.584 --> 10:45.818
no one notices me
mainlining the medicine.

10:45.820 --> 10:47.886
But what's "Jenna Hamilton"?

10:47.888 --> 10:49.588
Hmm?
What makes her so special?

10:49.590 --> 10:51.290
- I have no idea.
- Oh, well.

10:51.292 --> 10:52.925
You can always repeat
your junior year.

10:52.927 --> 10:55.060
- What?
- And apply yourself this time.

10:55.062 --> 10:57.229
And refrain from having
another psychotic breakdown

10:57.231 --> 10:59.965
and knifing people who care
for you in the heart--

10:59.967 --> 11:02.434
that would be me,
in case you need a clue.

11:02.436 --> 11:04.069
- How many times
do I have to apologize?

11:04.071 --> 11:05.170
Will you ever forgive me?

11:05.172 --> 11:07.706
- Of course, Jenna.
I'm a masochist.

11:07.708 --> 11:11.844
Anyway, another year would
improve your academic standing,

11:11.846 --> 11:14.113
and we would have fun together.

11:14.115 --> 11:16.382
- I think I'll just go forward
with my senior year.

11:16.384 --> 11:18.917
- Then have I got
a to-do list for you--

11:18.919 --> 11:20.753
retake your S.A.Ts,

11:20.755 --> 11:21.920
finish your two incompletes,

11:21.922 --> 11:24.022
go out for a sport,
join some clubs,

11:24.024 --> 11:26.258
build your resume,
define your brand,

11:26.260 --> 11:27.993
and drop to the floor
and give me ten.

11:27.995 --> 11:30.596
- You want me to do push-ups
for college?

11:30.598 --> 11:32.865
- No, strictly for
my entertainment.

11:32.867 --> 11:35.300
You got me fired.
You think I don't hold grudges?

11:35.302 --> 11:37.136
- I mean, I get
that I messed up last year--

11:37.138 --> 11:39.972
but all this stuff I have
to do to pad my resume?

11:39.974 --> 11:40.906
Where do I start?

11:40.908 --> 11:42.941
- You should join cheer squad.

11:42.943 --> 11:43.675
- Are you joking?

11:43.677 --> 11:45.144
- We need an equipment manager.

11:45.146 --> 11:46.245
Wrangle a few pom-poms,

11:46.247 --> 11:47.713
you got your first extracurric
on your app.

11:47.715 --> 11:49.681
- Thanks, but no thanks.
- You're 137.

11:49.683 --> 11:52.785
And I need an ally on the team
to buffer me from Sadie.

11:52.787 --> 11:55.621
And by the way,
WTF was she talking about?

11:55.623 --> 11:58.223
Your parents caught you
tiptoeing through the tulips?

11:58.225 --> 12:00.426
- Why is everyone making
such a big deal

12:00.428 --> 12:02.594
out of something
that everyone does?

12:02.596 --> 12:04.396
- Not everyone.
- Oh, please.

12:04.398 --> 12:06.799
- Jake satisfies
all my sexual needs.

12:06.801 --> 12:08.333
- Oh, how nice for you.

12:08.335 --> 12:09.768
- Though I am curious.

12:09.770 --> 12:13.372
When you...Do...
You know?

12:13.374 --> 12:15.808
- Crack the code, t.
- Fine.

12:15.810 --> 12:17.142
Do you have orgasms?

12:17.144 --> 12:18.477
- Why else would I do it?

12:18.479 --> 12:22.047
- So, like, normal big Os
or bigger big Os?

12:22.049 --> 12:24.249
I'm just curious
how they compare to mine,

12:24.251 --> 12:25.517
and what I've read
on Wikipedia

12:25.519 --> 12:27.386
and various
and sundry sex blogs.

12:27.388 --> 12:29.021
- Tamara, have you ever
had an orgasm?

12:29.023 --> 12:31.557
- With Jake or in general?
- Either.

12:31.559 --> 12:33.892
- All the time.
I'm pretty sure.

12:33.894 --> 12:36.995
- You'd know if you'd had one.

12:36.997 --> 12:39.064
[Door squeaking]

12:41.968 --> 12:45.737
- [Whispers]
It's all about the clit.

12:46.773 --> 12:50.042
[Jake playing guitar]

12:50.044 --> 12:53.245
â™ª

12:53.247 --> 12:56.081
- would you please stop?

12:56.083 --> 12:58.550
I'm trying to concentrate.

12:58.552 --> 12:59.785
- What about a study break?

12:59.787 --> 13:01.920
- I've got
a million things to do.

13:01.922 --> 13:03.222
- Oh, that's funny,

13:03.224 --> 13:06.391
'cause I've only
got one thing on my mind.

13:07.393 --> 13:09.428
- [Sighs]

13:09.430 --> 13:12.865
- â™ª You don't have to speak
I already know the deal â™ª

13:12.867 --> 13:15.334
â™ª you're faithful
and willing to do my will â™ª

13:15.336 --> 13:19.238
â™ª if I ever need something,
you go and get it â™ª

13:19.240 --> 13:22.341
â™ª if I got something new
in mind you're down with it â™ª

13:22.343 --> 13:25.344
- [grunts]
All done.

13:25.346 --> 13:29.581
That was great.
- Yeah, it was.

13:30.950 --> 13:33.552
- I need to be valedictorian.

13:33.554 --> 13:35.888
- Why not be happy
with number three?

13:35.890 --> 13:37.389
- Because that's complacency,

13:37.391 --> 13:41.026
and complacency leads
to stupidity and obesity.

13:41.028 --> 13:42.227
- And you're neither,

13:42.229 --> 13:45.163
so maybe you could be
a little complacent.

13:45.165 --> 13:46.498
- [Sighs]

13:46.500 --> 13:47.766
- Would you be more relaxed?

13:47.768 --> 13:49.067
- I hate being relaxed!

13:49.069 --> 13:51.770
God, you're such an idiot,
it's irritating.

13:51.772 --> 13:53.372
[Knock on door]

13:54.274 --> 13:55.707
- You guys about to screw?

13:55.709 --> 13:58.310
- Can you get out of my room?
We're doing homework.

13:58.312 --> 14:00.312
- I'm glad you're getting it
regularly.

14:00.314 --> 14:02.848
You're a little
less of a beast.

14:02.850 --> 14:04.016
Did she tell you
about Jenna

14:04.018 --> 14:06.018
rubbing one out
this morning?

14:06.020 --> 14:08.720
Little bitch had
a little itch.

14:08.722 --> 14:09.354
[Laughs]

14:09.356 --> 14:11.123
- If you give us some privacy,

14:11.125 --> 14:13.992
I'll let you use the car later.

14:15.061 --> 14:17.229
- We have ten places to go
before they close.

14:17.231 --> 14:18.864
- Mom, you said
this wouldn't take long.

14:18.866 --> 14:20.032
I've got a million things
to do,

14:20.034 --> 14:21.433
including college apps,
a biology quiz

14:21.435 --> 14:23.035
at the end of the week--
I am not good at biology.

14:23.037 --> 14:25.003
- You're putting
too much pressure on yourself.

14:25.005 --> 14:26.371
You have to prioritize shopping.

14:26.373 --> 14:28.640
Oh, sweetie,
there's something here

14:28.642 --> 14:29.608
I think you could use.

14:29.610 --> 14:31.577
- What could I possibly use?
Oh, God!

14:31.579 --> 14:32.377
Mom! No!

14:32.379 --> 14:33.579
I don't need you
micromanaging me.

14:33.581 --> 14:35.847
This is my senior year.
You already had yours.

14:35.849 --> 14:37.115
So please
just let me have mine.

14:37.117 --> 14:39.318
- Okay, well,
I'm just trying to help.

14:39.320 --> 14:40.485
- I don't need your help.

14:40.487 --> 14:42.120
I don't need your tips
on how to do my hair,

14:42.122 --> 14:43.488
what shoes to buy,
how to dress,

14:43.490 --> 14:46.358
and most certainly
not how to masturbate.

14:47.627 --> 14:49.061
- Jenna.

14:50.363 --> 14:52.564
- Matty.

14:54.867 --> 14:56.134
- Let's pretend
that you didn't hear me

14:56.136 --> 14:57.436
just yell the word "masturbate,"

14:57.438 --> 14:58.904
and that you're not wearing
floral board shorts

14:58.906 --> 15:00.205
inside an indoor mall.

15:00.207 --> 15:03.175
- Deal.
You do realize I'm working?

15:03.177 --> 15:04.276
- Oh. Right.

15:04.278 --> 15:06.578
When did you start?
- Last week.

15:06.580 --> 15:08.747
It is the dumbest job ever,
but they recruited me.

15:08.749 --> 15:12.284
Plus my parents have been
real a-holes since the divorce.

15:12.286 --> 15:14.286
They keep hanging all
this money stuff over me,

15:14.288 --> 15:15.887
so I figured I'd make
my own money.

15:15.889 --> 15:17.589
- Granted, I hadn't seen him
all summer,

15:17.591 --> 15:19.625
but this seemed so un-Matty,

15:19.627 --> 15:21.293
I didn't really know
what to say.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.228
How's Bailey?
- She's fine.

15:23.230 --> 15:25.797
I guess. I haven't seen her
in a few months.

15:25.799 --> 15:27.466
I'm pretty sure she moved.

15:27.468 --> 15:29.034
- You and she--

15:29.036 --> 15:30.869
- that fizzled pretty fast
after prom.

15:30.871 --> 15:33.038
- Oh, I thought you and her
are--

15:33.040 --> 15:36.508
- I just wasn't really
feeling it.

15:36.510 --> 15:40.012
- Is there, like, any stuff
on sale right now?

15:40.014 --> 15:41.780
- I have no clue.

15:41.782 --> 15:44.983
They don't want me answering
questions about the merchandise.

15:44.985 --> 15:47.586
- So what is it
you actually do here?

15:49.522 --> 15:53.392
- Ah, code red.
Yeah, code red.

16:02.402 --> 16:05.137
- Okay, what was up with Matty
being single all summer?

16:05.139 --> 16:06.938
And why was it bugging me
so much?

16:06.940 --> 16:08.740
Did Jake tell you Matty
was single?

16:08.742 --> 16:09.908
- No.
- It's weird.

16:09.910 --> 16:11.810
I still think
there's something between us.

16:11.812 --> 16:14.012
- Yeah, after
last year's lamentable legacy

16:14.014 --> 16:15.414
of deceit, double dealing,
and damage,

16:15.416 --> 16:18.016
you think he wants to come back
for another serving of that?

16:18.018 --> 16:19.317
You need to get your house
in order

16:19.319 --> 16:21.386
before you think about getting
a man in your life.

16:21.388 --> 16:22.788
- Tell me about it.

16:22.790 --> 16:24.890
May I?

16:24.892 --> 16:26.858
- Please.
- Oh.

16:26.860 --> 16:28.860
I am so done with men.

16:36.503 --> 16:38.370

equipment manager position.

17:22.149 --> 17:23.615
And number two,

17:23.617 --> 17:26.718
You need a separate calendar
for each class and activity.

17:26.720 --> 17:28.487
And make sure you schedule
your free time, too.

17:28.489 --> 17:30.522

17:30.524 --> 17:31.823

to see that?
- Okay.

25:08.615 --> 25:09.814
Well, you made me sit
through

25:09.816 --> 25:11.616
all three <i>Transformers</i> movies.

25:11.618 --> 25:12.617
- "Oh, Bella!"

25:12.619 --> 25:14.786
"Edward."
"Bella."

25:14.788 --> 25:16.754
- Okay,
I'm a hopeless romantic.

- Well, don't be
a hopeless one.

- Hey, watch the movie!

25:29.936 --> 25:31.269
Hey! Hey! Hey!

25:31.271 --> 25:32.804
- What is this [Bleep] show

25:32.806 --> 25:36.941
that is literally
a [Bleep] show?

- I said movie magic,
not movie tragic!

25:47.954 --> 25:50.154
What happened to my
sweet, romantic

25:50.156 --> 25:51.055

musical comedies?

25:51.057 --> 25:52.957

sick musical comedy fetish

25:52.959 --> 25:54.993

a bullet in its head.

John Waters in their lives.

nightmares!

25:59.766 --> 26:00.565
Both: Ooh.

26:00.567 --> 26:01.766
- Well, at least their
nightmares

26:01.768 --> 26:03.001
will be interesting
instead of some

26:03.003 --> 26:04.902

26:04.904 --> 26:07.205
- Are those cannabis lollipops?

26:07.207 --> 26:09.173
No drugs or alcohol allowed!

26:09.175 --> 26:11.042
Are you trying to spoil this
for everyone?

26:11.044 --> 26:13.344
- We have prescriptions.
- We need it for the anxiety

26:13.346 --> 26:15.079
you're giving us right now.

26:15.081 --> 26:16.881
- Put on something else.

26:16.883 --> 26:20.151
Please.

26:20.686 --> 26:21.886

- Then let's get out of here.

26:44.944 --> 26:47.078
Come on.

26:53.986 --> 26:55.753
- [Sighs]
- What's wrong?

26:55.755 --> 26:56.688
- Everything.

26:56.690 --> 26:57.789
Everything is wrong.

26:57.791 --> 26:59.557
Do you know how much pressure
I'm under?

26:59.559 --> 27:01.192
Photo fiasco, filthy flicks,

27:01.194 --> 27:02.860
college trapplications,
cheer jeer--

27:02.862 --> 27:05.363
all this tension is building up
and, no offense,

27:05.365 --> 27:07.799
but the big "O"
has been a big no-show

27:07.801 --> 27:09.834
in the Jake and Tamara
high school musical.

27:09.836 --> 27:11.202
- Huh?
- Jake, how many times,

27:11.204 --> 27:14.439
if you had to guess,
do you think we've had sex?

27:14.441 --> 27:15.773
- A thousand?
- Close.

27:15.775 --> 27:18.509
101.
And out of those 101 times,

27:18.511 --> 27:20.678
how many times have you
had an orgasm?

27:20.680 --> 27:22.547
- 101. Duh.

27:22.549 --> 27:24.082
It's probably more
like 125.

27:24.084 --> 27:25.350
Sometimes I have a two-fer.

27:25.352 --> 27:26.651
Why? How many have you had?

27:26.653 --> 27:28.486
- Maybe half.
- So like 60?

27:28.488 --> 27:30.788
- Actually, half of 101
is actually 50.5,

27:30.790 --> 27:32.890
how are we so close
in class rank?

27:32.892 --> 27:34.125
Anyway, no.

27:34.127 --> 27:36.427
I haven't had 50.5 orgasms.

27:36.429 --> 27:38.262
More like
50 half-gasms.

27:38.264 --> 27:40.398
- "Half-gasms"?
Jesus, Tamara.

27:40.400 --> 27:41.733
Just tell me
what the problem is.

27:41.735 --> 27:45.870
- I don't know.
I'm not a sexpert.

27:45.872 --> 27:49.540
- Well, let's figure it out.

27:52.911 --> 27:57.749
- Awful lot of stuff
going on up there.

27:57.751 --> 27:59.951
- A bucketload of stars.

27:59.953 --> 28:04.188
- And we're just on this
tiny, spinning ball of clay.

28:04.190 --> 28:07.158
Kind of makes me feel like
all this

28:07.160 --> 28:08.826

I've been stressing about

28:08.828 --> 28:10.728
isn't that earth-shattering.

28:10.730 --> 28:16.367
- The last time I checked,
the earth was still here.

28:16.369 --> 28:18.503
Yep.

28:18.505 --> 28:22.707
Still one big old chunk.

28:23.842 --> 28:24.976
- You like that?

28:24.978 --> 28:28.513
- No. It's porny.

28:28.515 --> 28:31.182
- How about that? Huh?

28:31.184 --> 28:33.618
Oh, come on, baby,
it's hot, right?

28:33.620 --> 28:35.920
Tamara, you gotta tell me--

28:35.922 --> 28:38.222
- it's okay,
just not the talking.

28:38.224 --> 28:39.624
And will you ease up
down there?

28:39.626 --> 28:42.093
You're not touching anything
that has sensation.

28:42.095 --> 28:44.629

28:45.264 --> 28:46.798

What was that?

28:46.800 --> 28:50.334
- It's no use!
You're never gonna get me off!

28:50.336 --> 28:53.638
[Laughter]

28:56.742 --> 28:59.777
- Good morning,
Palos Hills seniors!

28:59.779 --> 29:01.646
This is your life.

29:01.648 --> 29:04.182
Time to put the shake up
in your wake up

29:04.184 --> 29:06.851
and make...It...Happen!

29:06.853 --> 29:08.786
- Well, this is
an embarrassment of glitches.

29:08.788 --> 29:11.022
My secret shame-out
is now a public flame-out.

29:11.024 --> 29:13.291
- Relax, Tamara.
No one knows it was you.

29:13.293 --> 29:15.460
- "Oh, Jake."
[Groans]

29:15.462 --> 29:18.329
- I'll cut you, dude!

29:19.865 --> 29:21.666
You need to let go of shame

29:21.668 --> 29:23.501
and just get to know
your own body.

29:23.503 --> 29:26.504
- Oh, no, I am not
into tickling my fancy.

29:26.506 --> 29:27.872
- Well, if you don't know
your own body,

29:27.874 --> 29:31.809
then how do you expect
some guy to?

29:34.012 --> 29:35.847
- Oh, you can catch.

29:35.849 --> 29:38.983
Now show me
if you can also fetch.

29:38.985 --> 29:42.420
You should feel right at home
in there.

29:42.422 --> 29:43.554
- My little brother's here.

29:43.556 --> 29:45.623
Come and meet him.
Come on.

29:47.025 --> 29:47.959
Hi, mommy.

29:47.961 --> 29:49.994
- Hi, baby.
- Where's your little brother?

29:49.996 --> 29:53.865
- Oh, he's in the backseat.
He's finishing his bottle.

blessed America.

30:05.245 --> 30:08.846

But we call him Tyler.

30:08.848 --> 30:09.714
- You must be Sadie.

30:09.716 --> 30:11.449
Lissa speaks so highly of you.

30:11.451 --> 30:13.217
- Okay, you're like 40.

30:13.219 --> 30:14.385
- [Chuckles]
Only 18.

30:14.387 --> 30:15.720
- We think of him
as just two months

30:15.722 --> 30:16.988
because that's when he met us,

30:16.990 --> 30:19.557
was saved and born again--
praise be.

30:19.559 --> 30:22.894
- What religion exactly
were you saved from?

30:22.896 --> 30:24.962
Worshipping fertility idols?

30:24.964 --> 30:26.130
Fire walking?

30:26.132 --> 30:27.865
- Actually my family's Catholic,
but I did attend

30:27.867 --> 30:30.067
the Anglican church when
I went to school in england.

30:30.069 --> 30:34.005
- And we are so happy
to have Tyler in our fold now.

30:34.007 --> 30:35.840

looking forward

30:35.842 --> 30:37.942

It's a dream come true.

30:41.381 --> 30:43.014
- While some dreams
were coming true,

30:43.016 --> 30:44.615
my life was a nightmare.

30:44.617 --> 30:45.816
Even Lissa had it together--

30:45.818 --> 30:48.386
a way higher class rank
than me, cheer captain,

30:48.388 --> 30:50.688
and a very hot
charitable endeavor.

30:50.690 --> 30:52.089
I had to get with the program.

30:52.091 --> 30:55.192
The first items on my
to-do list were pretty basic--

30:55.194 --> 30:57.028
one, make to-do list.

30:57.030 --> 30:58.629
Two, suck it up.

30:58.631 --> 31:01.365
Three, focus.
Number three was hard.

31:01.367 --> 31:02.733
'Cause I kept thinking
about how nice

31:02.735 --> 31:05.102
it was sleeping
on the grass next to Matty.

Numbers four, five, and six,

31:08.341 --> 31:10.641
fill out common application,
write essay.

31:10.643 --> 31:12.043
It was a lot easier
to think about

31:12.045 --> 31:14.412
how Matty smelled
like soap and sweat and--

31:14.414 --> 31:16.180
what was number three again?

31:16.182 --> 31:17.982
Focus. Focus.
Focus. Focus.

31:17.984 --> 31:20.217
But it was too overwhelming.
It was too much.

your work cut out for you.

Well, so far,
I've only filled out my address.

31:37.604 --> 31:38.869

- Like what?

31:41.507 --> 31:44.342
- Like tons of stuff.

right just the same.

You want me to help you
with your essays?

34:38.217 --> 34:40.584
- You're a pretty decent writer.
- "Pretty decent"?

I suddenly had a zero tolerance
policy for distraction action.

34:44.524 --> 34:48.292
You know, Matty, I've got
my own college essay questions

34:48.294 --> 34:50.294
to answer, and my own future
to worry about,

34:50.296 --> 34:53.831
because, in case
you hadn't heard, I'm 137.

34:53.833 --> 34:57.101
- Okay.

34:57.769 --> 35:01.138
Sorry I asked.

35:09.648 --> 35:11.048
- TCBing--
taking care of business--

35:11.050 --> 35:13.217
meant waking up in my clothes
with a stiff neck

35:13.219 --> 35:14.652
and feeling a little dejected

35:14.654 --> 35:16.086
that Matty had come to me
for help

35:16.088 --> 35:19.857
with his essay
and not for--well, me.

35:19.859 --> 35:22.893

something accomplished.

35:39.245 --> 35:40.411
- Why do you sound so uptight?

35:40.413 --> 35:42.213
- Because I have been up
all night dealing

35:42.215 --> 35:44.615
with student handbook revisions
because, apparently,

35:44.617 --> 35:46.817
I'm the only elected official
in this school

35:46.819 --> 35:48.285
who knows
how to multitask,

35:49.889 --> 35:51.288
who actually knows
how to write a cheer,

35:51.290 --> 35:53.390
and the only AFS member
who knows

35:53.392 --> 35:54.959
that a Brazilian exchange
student

35:54.961 --> 35:56.560
can't read a Spanish textbook.

35:56.562 --> 35:58.562
Oh,

35:58.564 --> 36:00.064

full of seniors

36:00.066 --> 36:02.433
that her boyfriend,
who is barely speaking to her,

36:02.435 --> 36:03.434
can't get her off!

36:03.436 --> 36:04.702
That is why I'm so uptight!

36:04.704 --> 36:07.805

need to chillax.

You know, if you weren't
being satisfied,

36:33.065 --> 36:34.465
you could've just told me.

36:34.467 --> 36:35.900
- I did.
- I meant

36:35.902 --> 36:37.301
not over a loudspeaker.

36:37.303 --> 36:39.270
- Nobody knows it was us.

that your sex life
is sex death.

Not surprised.

But still, keep that nastiness

to yourself, please.

36:51.316 --> 36:54.018
- Clearly Tamara's
GPS-ing of her g-spot

36:54.020 --> 36:55.886
wasn't enough to relieve
the ongoing tension.

36:55.888 --> 36:58.489
Which left me wondering
if I'd been too harsh

36:58.491 --> 36:59.723
with Matty last night.

36:59.725 --> 37:02.660
Hey, I'm sorry about the way
I handled things last night.

on my plate--

Jenna, it's cool.

37:06.999 --> 37:08.499
I gotta get to class.

37:10.703 --> 37:11.802
I'd blown him off?

37:11.804 --> 37:13.237
I was confused.

37:13.239 --> 37:14.438
But I didn't have time to be,

37:14.440 --> 37:16.073
because I was working
my way down the list,

I was gonna fix my life.

37:23.749 --> 37:25.282
and make sure it captures
the essence of my brand.

37:25.284 --> 37:27.418

Your "brand"?

Jenna, you can't fix
everything overnight.

37:29.655 --> 37:31.722
You need to eat.

go with the classic Brat?
