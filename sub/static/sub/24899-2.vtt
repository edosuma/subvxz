WEBVTT

00:01.020 --> 00:02.500
Sorry to hear about your informant.

00:02.580 --> 00:03.940
I told you everything I knew.

00:04.740 --> 00:07.180
Stay with her! Stay with her!

00:08.460 --> 00:10.672
Sasa Dragenev. Stealing
and transporting

00:10.685 --> 00:12.420
high-end cars to the continent.

00:12.500 --> 00:14.740
I know I shouldn't have, man,
but I checked Sophie's phone.

00:14.820 --> 00:16.660
That's a no-win there, bruv.

00:18.500 --> 00:19.780
Urgh! Yeah, that's for Sabine.

00:20.900 --> 00:22.300
Jonesy's been shot!

00:23.140 --> 00:25.220
Bishop, not your fault.
Now get it together.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:46.700 --> 00:49.220
Hot drinks.

00:49.300 --> 00:50.860
Come on, it's a big day.

01:04.540 --> 01:06.180
Go knock 'em dead, girl.

01:06.260 --> 01:08.540
You made the right decision.
Yeah.

01:13.100 --> 01:14.860
Say, "I can do it."

01:16.540 --> 01:18.180
I can do it.

01:18.260 --> 01:19.500
There you go.

01:28.700 --> 01:31.140
See you later.
Got to pick up Bish.

01:53.300 --> 01:55.780
Has she chucked you out?
What the hell is wrong with you?

01:55.860 --> 01:58.780
What's wrong?
That's how black people get shot.

01:58.860 --> 02:00.500
Come on, man,
where's your sense of humour?

02:00.580 --> 02:01.780
On holiday.

02:01.860 --> 02:04.860
And why do we still have Tanner's
car? I don't like it.

02:04.940 --> 02:06.820
Come on, man.
Give me a smile, honey.

02:06.900 --> 02:08.740
You dickhead.

03:03.623 --> 03:05.663
When are we getting rid of this car,
man?

03:05.743 --> 03:07.983
I can't be taken how small it is.
What's the problem?

03:08.063 --> 03:10.903
There's nothing wrong with the car.
I like the car. It's grown on me.

03:10.983 --> 03:13.423
I like the car. I like the car.
Forget it. Forget it.

03:16.063 --> 03:18.423
I think Tanner's my kind of woman,
y'know, man?

03:18.503 --> 03:20.503
Yeah, probably with that.

03:20.583 --> 03:22.543
Well. Maybe not. Oh, now.

03:22.623 --> 03:25.143
Maybe not, maybe not. Oh, OK.

03:25.223 --> 03:26.703
Maybe, though. Maybe, though.

03:26.783 --> 03:28.543
Pepper spray! Oi!

03:28.623 --> 03:30.583
What's wrong with you?

03:30.663 --> 03:32.423
What you doing?
Hold up. It's Nell.

03:32.503 --> 03:34.143
Nellios, what you got for us?

03:34.223 --> 03:36.103
An international criminal no less.

03:36.183 --> 03:38.023
Congratulations. You guys are
closest.

03:39.023 --> 03:41.783
We're tracking
a Mr Michael Sharp -

03:41.863 --> 03:44.183
British citizen
but holds a Dutch passport.

03:44.263 --> 03:46.823
He's got two arrest warrants
for armed robbery

03:46.903 --> 03:48.863
and drug smuggling outstanding.

03:48.943 --> 03:51.343
NCA thought
he'd left the country for good,

03:51.423 --> 03:55.623
until he just cleared Customs
at Stansted an hour ago.

03:55.703 --> 03:57.663
Pinging you his flight details now.

03:57.743 --> 04:00.183
You certain it's him?
Retina scan at Customs.

04:00.263 --> 04:01.383
One Michael Sharp.

04:01.463 --> 04:03.383
A name - that's all we've got?
Not much, is it?

04:03.463 --> 04:05.423
Check your inbox.

04:05.503 --> 04:09.703
Michael Sharp booked a limo, using
a credit card, heading for London.

04:09.783 --> 04:12.423
Romeo, X-ray, 1-6,
Romeo, X-ray, Golf.

04:12.503 --> 04:14.383
All right, just send me this...
Already did.

04:14.463 --> 04:16.223
Just keep me and Tanner informed,
will you?

04:17.942 --> 04:19.382
Woof!

04:19.463 --> 04:21.743
Why's she got such a bad attitude?
I don't know, man.

04:21.822 --> 04:23.743
I'm gonna have to say something to
her.

04:23.823 --> 04:25.823
Maybe it's cos you shot her partner,
bro?

04:25.903 --> 04:28.983
It's not because I shot her partner
she always behaves like this.

04:29.063 --> 04:31.023
Think it's because she hates me.

04:31.103 --> 04:32.983
I reckon it's the opposite, man.

04:34.903 --> 04:35.983
Yeah.

04:39.583 --> 04:43.263
A bylaw which states the use of
canals in Greater London

04:43.343 --> 04:46.703
should be restricted to industrial
and commercial use only

04:46.783 --> 04:48.823
and that pleasure use should be
banned.

04:48.903 --> 04:50.623
Indeed this is what local
residents...

04:50.703 --> 04:52.343
What do you think?

04:52.463 --> 04:54.063
Think I'll buy it now.

04:54.143 --> 04:58.023
..pollution legislation
and the occasional pleasure cruiser.

04:58.832 --> 05:01.072
Still no sign of Sharp.
Are we even close?

05:01.152 --> 05:04.072
According to the tracker on the limo,
you're literally on top of him.

05:07.232 --> 05:11.792
There. There. There.
There. RX16 RXG. Let's go.

05:11.872 --> 05:14.192
That's your guy.

05:14.272 --> 05:15.992
That's the guy, yeah?
That's the guy.

05:16.072 --> 05:18.032
Welcome home, Mr Sharp.

05:20.632 --> 05:24.072
We have eyes on Sharp, ma'am.
Stay close but don't engage.

05:24.152 --> 05:25.872
Let's see what he gets up to.

05:25.952 --> 05:28.032
Got it.
And don't eat my pot noodle.

05:28.112 --> 05:31.112
Otherwise I'll wrap the tights round
your neck and pepper spray you.

05:31.192 --> 05:34.112
And I want my car back in one piece,
you little fuckers.

05:34.192 --> 05:36.152
It's only temporary.

05:37.352 --> 05:39.752
What are they like, eh, Wally?

06:04.752 --> 06:07.432
Suspect is entering
a building on Lombard Street.

06:07.512 --> 06:09.472
Number 96. No name plaque.

06:10.072 --> 06:11.792
Roger that. Checking now.

06:13.672 --> 06:15.872
I swear you eat like
you're five years old, man.

06:15.952 --> 06:18.392
You've got yoghurt on your sleeve
or something.

06:18.472 --> 06:21.832
Shit. Lively round the breakfast
table this morning, mate.

06:21.912 --> 06:24.592
How are the girls, man? Good?
Yeah, man, good.

06:25.272 --> 06:26.792
Sophie?

06:26.872 --> 06:28.832
Yeah, man. Good.

06:33.552 --> 06:35.872
Well, it's a busy morning. Very.

06:37.432 --> 06:39.552
What's he up to, man?

06:39.632 --> 06:42.592
Man lies low, just turns up
out of the blue,

06:43.192 --> 06:45.872
heads straight to the City
with a wheelie case.

06:45.952 --> 06:48.112
Strike you as odd?
Little bit. Yeah.

06:49.472 --> 06:50.632
Jeez!

06:50.712 --> 06:53.992
You can't park here.
Disabled space. Brother, we're -

06:54.072 --> 06:57.352
I'm not your brother! Now move your
car before I give you a ticket.

06:57.432 --> 06:59.512
I tried to be nice, you know.

06:59.592 --> 07:01.872
OK? Yes, brother.

07:01.952 --> 07:03.912
Now, shoo. Go on, off you go.

07:04.592 --> 07:07.592
The building that Sharp just went
into is a safety deposit bank.

07:07.672 --> 07:09.632
No public access. Very exclusive.

07:09.712 --> 07:13.312
Mainly wealthy Middle Eastern,
Russian and Chinese clients.

07:16.632 --> 07:18.952
10-31, 10-31, 10-31!

07:19.032 --> 07:22.592
Shots fired at previous address.
Request for backup.

07:22.672 --> 07:24.032
Stop!

07:28.792 --> 07:30.352
We going in? Yeah.

07:30.432 --> 07:32.392
After you, man.

07:32.472 --> 07:33.752
Thanks.

07:33.832 --> 07:36.992
Armed police! No-one move! If you
don't move, you don't get shot!

07:42.192 --> 07:44.832
Right, I know this is confusing,
but we are the good guys.

07:46.072 --> 07:48.192
Which way?
Which way did they go?

07:48.272 --> 07:50.232
Leave her, she's in shock. Come on.

07:53.192 --> 07:55.312
You hear that?
Drilling downstairs.

08:01.712 --> 08:03.392
You good to go? Yeah, man, you?

08:03.472 --> 08:05.112
Yeah.

08:08.472 --> 08:10.272
Stay down.

08:14.232 --> 08:16.232
Go on. Yeah.

08:21.032 --> 08:22.552
Go on.

08:22.632 --> 08:24.592
Yeah, man, I got it.

08:27.672 --> 08:29.672
One, two, three...

08:32.631 --> 08:34.392
Ssh, ssh.

08:34.472 --> 08:37.032
Which way did they go?
Keep still.

08:37.111 --> 08:39.912
Where did they go?
Far end. Fire exit.

08:53.352 --> 08:55.832
Sharp's in a white van
heading to Lombard Street.

08:57.592 --> 08:59.592
Backup en route.

09:01.512 --> 09:03.272
No, no, no.
They haven't seen us yet.

09:03.352 --> 09:05.312
All units! Sharp must not get away!

09:12.992 --> 09:14.872
Who the fuck was that?

09:16.352 --> 09:17.432
Come on.

09:21.632 --> 09:24.312
Stay in the car! Stay in the car!
Stay in the car!

09:24.392 --> 09:26.672
Keep your head down.
Keep your head down.

09:27.392 --> 09:29.872
You out of breath, yeah?
I'm not out of breath, man.

09:30.632 --> 09:31.952
What is he doing?

09:32.032 --> 09:34.512
You guys OK?

09:34.592 --> 09:35.952
Go! Go! Go!

09:40.952 --> 09:42.392
Whoo!

09:44.112 --> 09:45.392
Fuck!

09:55.512 --> 09:57.152
Bish! Bish!

10:04.552 --> 10:06.352
Go, go, go!

10:08.512 --> 10:09.832
Fuck!

10:23.432 --> 10:25.472
Go, go!

10:28.432 --> 10:29.672
Come on!

10:29.752 --> 10:31.712
Fan out! No crossing!

10:46.872 --> 10:49.352
You all right?

10:49.432 --> 10:51.392
- Not really, no.
- Come on!

11:01.192 --> 11:03.552
Take 'em out, Bish!
My gun's jammed!

11:13.752 --> 11:15.992
Which way?

11:23.872 --> 11:25.752
Drop the gun.

11:27.752 --> 11:29.752
OK. OK. Take it easy.

11:35.672 --> 11:36.752
Agh!

11:42.672 --> 11:43.832
Let's go!

11:44.592 --> 11:46.312
Oh, we're throwing guns now, yeah?

11:46.392 --> 11:47.912
Is that even Sharp?

11:47.992 --> 11:50.072
Bruv, it worked, didn't it?
Better than you did.

11:50.152 --> 11:52.032
Hey, hey, I couldn't get a clear
shot.

11:52.112 --> 11:54.072
Oh, don't come with that!

11:54.152 --> 11:55.912
And you? Aargh!

11:56.632 --> 11:58.312
You owe me a new pair of Dragons,
man.

11:58.392 --> 11:59.872
Yeah, and some Tims.

11:59.952 --> 12:02.432
Put your hands behind your back.

12:05.487 --> 12:05.632
Stay with her! Stay with her!

12:05.633 --> 12:07.334
Look after my hound, will you,
please?

12:07.414 --> 12:09.854
I just want to talk to some people
over here.

12:12.214 --> 12:13.414
Sir?

12:13.494 --> 12:16.174
You wanted confirmation.
It was armed robbery.

12:16.254 --> 12:17.894
And we have a suspect in custody.

12:17.974 --> 12:21.134
Not Sharp, I'm afraid.
But we're assuming he's behind it.

12:21.214 --> 12:22.654
Any casualties?

12:22.734 --> 12:25.214
Only the criminals, ma'am,
and they don't count.

12:25.974 --> 12:28.214
It was a joke, ma'am.

12:28.294 --> 12:31.054
Probably inappropriate.
I'll keep you updated, sir.

12:31.134 --> 12:33.614
Good. Thank you. Yeah.

12:37.894 --> 12:39.894
Fucking woman.

12:44.494 --> 12:46.374
So who's this prick, then?

12:46.454 --> 12:47.894
James Barton, ma'am.

12:47.974 --> 12:50.614
Has previous.
Not his first armed robbery.

12:50.694 --> 12:52.654
He mentioned Michael Sharp yet?

12:52.734 --> 12:54.814
All we've had is, "No comment",
ma'am.

12:56.334 --> 12:57.734
How's your face?

12:57.814 --> 12:59.774
You and Munroe were lucky.

12:59.854 --> 13:01.814
Could have been a lot worse.

13:01.894 --> 13:03.374
Yeah.

13:05.534 --> 13:07.934
Here you go. Four sugars.

13:13.494 --> 13:15.854
We sent a WPC round your house.

13:17.494 --> 13:19.654
Your wife knows you've been arrested.

13:20.454 --> 13:23.214
Not sure if she er... told the kids
yet.

13:24.454 --> 13:26.694
But they'll find out, anyway.

13:26.774 --> 13:29.235
Probably too young
to comprehend how

13:29.248 --> 13:31.654
it is to have a
father doing an 18.

13:33.174 --> 13:36.974
And then there's the older kids,
the ones that are gonna bully them.

13:38.574 --> 13:40.574
They'll definitely let 'em know.

13:43.374 --> 13:45.374
And all without a father around.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.174
Give us a name. One name.

13:50.254 --> 13:52.214
Sharp. We know it was him.

13:54.294 --> 13:56.534
Place him on the scene.
Make your life easy.

13:56.614 --> 13:58.574
Just tell us where he is.

13:58.654 --> 14:00.614
Why do time for him?

14:00.694 --> 14:02.654
Give your kids a chance in life.

14:05.454 --> 14:07.894
This better be urgent.
You need to see this.

14:09.574 --> 14:11.974
Bish. Didn't you wanna
say something to Nell?

14:12.054 --> 14:14.054
Shut up, man.
Something about her attitude?

14:14.134 --> 14:15.574
Wanna say something to me, Bish?

14:15.654 --> 14:19.054
Er... yeah. Great shooting earlier.
You were fantastic at that.

14:20.614 --> 14:23.134
So, Sharp enters the facility.
We know that.

14:24.934 --> 14:26.774
Enter his team. We know that too.

14:26.854 --> 14:29.014
Are they sure on those disguises?

14:29.094 --> 14:31.814
Instead of joining them,
Sharp lies flat on the floor

14:31.894 --> 14:33.665
while the Blues
Brothers rig the door

14:33.678 --> 14:35.414
to the vaulted area
and detonate it.

14:37.414 --> 14:39.494
One of his team holds the reception
area

14:39.574 --> 14:43.054
while the others go through
the blown-up doors into Deposits.

14:43.814 --> 14:45.094
OK, now, question.

14:45.174 --> 14:48.734
Is it odd that Sharp doesn't
participate in stealing the gems?

14:49.414 --> 14:52.334
He's still face down in reception.
Play on, Kamali.

14:52.414 --> 14:56.414
Suspect in reception deploys
more canisters and joins the others.

14:56.494 --> 14:59.134
Minutes later,
two cowboys show up with guns.

14:59.214 --> 15:00.734
Armed police! No-one move!

15:00.814 --> 15:02.934
If you don't move, you don't get
shot!

15:04.974 --> 15:06.974
That within police guidelines?

15:07.054 --> 15:11.134
Sharp is lying on the ground,
right next to you. You had him.

15:12.774 --> 15:16.254
Finally, the civilians are
evacuated. And Sharp leaves.

15:16.334 --> 15:19.134
Now switch back
to the exterior cam.

15:20.614 --> 15:23.414
He ditches his cap, but...
He hasn't stolen a thing.

15:26.334 --> 15:28.385
Transport Police
picked him up on their

15:28.398 --> 15:30.254
surv cam heading
into Bank Station.

15:30.334 --> 15:32.294
And then... vanished.

15:32.374 --> 15:36.854
270 tube stations in London. He
could have gone to any one of them.

15:36.934 --> 15:39.325
Leaves his own robbery
halfway through

15:39.338 --> 15:41.494
and then disappears
down the pipe.

15:44.094 --> 15:46.094
Doesn't make any sense, does it?

15:46.174 --> 15:47.534
No.

15:48.414 --> 15:50.694
Oi, you two!
Call for you on my line.

15:50.774 --> 15:52.134
Ahh...

15:53.814 --> 15:56.094
OK. Right, let's take it back
to the top.

15:56.974 --> 15:58.734
Heard you shot your mate, Bishop?

15:58.814 --> 16:00.934
Ha, ha, ha.
Wouldn't see that in our unit.

16:01.014 --> 16:03.254
Wouldn't see anything
if I punch your lights out.

16:03.334 --> 16:05.094
You sticking up for me?
Of course.

16:05.174 --> 16:07.614
I'm touched, man.

16:08.774 --> 16:10.774
Secret admirer, ma'am?

16:10.854 --> 16:13.014
Actually, they were sent in for
Jonesy.

16:13.094 --> 16:15.254
But I thought, "Fuck it, he won't
know."

16:16.334 --> 16:18.814
He's out of intensive,
since you asked, Bishop.

16:18.894 --> 16:21.574
Officer Pike. Caramel swirl.

16:21.654 --> 16:23.294
Strawberry delight. Hey. Hey.

16:24.574 --> 16:26.614
Go on.

16:27.694 --> 16:28.814
Yeah.

16:30.214 --> 16:31.854
47.

16:31.934 --> 16:33.214
Thank you.

16:34.254 --> 16:36.894
That was Uniform.
Suspected murder in Barking.

16:36.974 --> 16:37.934
So?

16:38.014 --> 16:40.374
They've found stolen jewels
around the body.

16:40.454 --> 16:43.094
They're a match
with the ones from the robbery.

16:43.174 --> 16:45.134
Me? Toffee finger.

16:47.134 --> 16:50.294
Oi, where are you going with them?
You don't need those, ma'am.

17:02.534 --> 17:04.934
Yeah, that's pretty disgusting.
Yeah.

17:06.054 --> 17:08.773
Looks like they didn't come here
for the jewels.

17:09.614 --> 17:12.493
See if you can work your magic
on that phone, brother.

17:22.973 --> 17:25.733
Hotel, yeah?
You going anywhere nice?

17:28.253 --> 17:30.254
Whistles 'Why Are We Waiting?

17:30.334 --> 17:32.894
Ssh! I'm trying to concentrate.

17:34.934 --> 17:36.694
Yo, bro.

17:36.774 --> 17:38.774
Is everything OK?

17:38.854 --> 17:40.934
Hm? What? With what? Where?

17:41.014 --> 17:43.534
Here. There. Everywhere. Hm?

17:43.614 --> 17:45.574
Pike, I'm trying to unlock a
victim's phone.

17:45.654 --> 17:47.134
I'm asking, that's all.

17:47.214 --> 17:50.054
Sir. The recovered jewels.
Where do you want them to go?

17:50.134 --> 17:52.454
Treat your wife. He's joking.

17:52.534 --> 17:55.214
Have them dusted
and checked with Forensics.

17:55.894 --> 17:57.574
Voila. Cracked it.

18:00.014 --> 18:01.734
There is one call logged here.

18:01.814 --> 18:04.094
Called eight times in an hour.

18:04.174 --> 18:06.134
Number? Can you give me...

18:07.174 --> 18:09.014
I'm getting to that.

18:09.094 --> 18:11.054
In your own time.

18:12.534 --> 18:14.054
You two, boy.

18:19.814 --> 18:22.214
The logged call was from
one Curtis Cox of Dagenham.

18:22.294 --> 18:24.574
We're heading over there now.
Roger that.

18:24.654 --> 18:28.094
Erm... listen. Tread carefully, boys.
This doesn't smell right.

18:28.174 --> 18:30.334
Copy that. Oh, you need a bath.

18:30.414 --> 18:32.774
Sorry, ma'am?
Talking to the dog.

18:33.894 --> 18:35.974
I don't like that dog, you know.
It's

18:35.987 --> 18:38.134
got a vendetta against
me, I can tell.

18:38.214 --> 18:40.934
Bishop, everyone's got a vendetta
against you, bruv.

19:10.294 --> 19:13.334
Are you ready, bro?
Bishop in position.

19:23.254 --> 19:25.214
Well, this isn't good.

19:26.494 --> 19:29.094
If you ask me, Sharp's cleaning
house.

19:33.244 --> 19:33.334
Stay with her! Stay with her!

19:37.811 --> 19:40.971
Tough night, bruv. Yeah, man.

19:41.051 --> 19:43.411
At least we got people to go home to,
innit?

19:45.131 --> 19:46.931
Sleep well, bruv.

19:50.531 --> 19:52.811
Yeah, man.
Love to A and the girls, yeah?

19:52.891 --> 19:54.651
Same to Sophie. Yeah, man.

20:35.691 --> 20:38.611
Evening. Black guy.
Not as handsome as me.

20:38.691 --> 20:40.382
The same height,
with a massive chip

20:40.395 --> 20:42.051
on his shoulder.
He's checking out.

20:58.651 --> 21:01.971
Pack your bags, brother.
You're coming home with me, yeah?

21:13.531 --> 21:15.731
You should've come to me, man.

21:20.251 --> 21:22.931
You know you're the only family
I've got, yeah?

21:23.771 --> 21:26.091
We're the only family you need, man.

21:46.091 --> 21:48.091
Morning, Uncle Bishop.

21:56.651 --> 21:58.811
We brought you breakfast.

22:05.491 --> 22:07.571
Are you really coming to live
with us?

22:07.651 --> 22:09.131
Maybe.

22:09.211 --> 22:11.731
You snore. And so do you.

22:11.811 --> 22:12.931
No, I don't.

22:13.011 --> 22:15.331
We're sharing a room, trust me.

22:22.251 --> 22:23.571
Mm!

22:23.651 --> 22:25.131
Very nice.

22:52.131 --> 22:53.811
Just came to get my TV.

22:56.411 --> 22:58.011
Here, you er...

22:59.171 --> 23:00.731
Yeah, just erm...

23:01.731 --> 23:03.571
Just put it in my back pocket,
will you?

23:03.651 --> 23:05.091
Sure.

23:07.811 --> 23:09.291
Cheers.

23:13.131 --> 23:15.131
Wanna talk?

23:18.011 --> 23:20.291
You know, I gotta go.

23:20.371 --> 23:22.251
I'm running late.

23:32.851 --> 23:34.251
Hold it. You promised.

23:34.331 --> 23:36.651
You said you'd speak to them
yesterday.

23:36.731 --> 23:39.971
Indeed. We are starting litigation
now, Mr Smith.

23:40.051 --> 23:41.811
Mr Smith, yeah?

23:41.891 --> 23:44.691
I like it. I bet you're wearing
a power suit, innit?

23:44.771 --> 23:46.731
Oi. What are you wearing under your
skirt?

23:46.811 --> 23:49.011
I'll call you when there's news,
Mr Smith.

23:49.091 --> 23:51.051
But, at the moment, nothing.

23:51.131 --> 23:52.531
Goodbye.

23:53.571 --> 23:56.131
Sorry. Slightly mad client.

23:57.211 --> 23:59.371
No knickers, ta rass!

23:59.451 --> 24:01.211
Jeez!

24:11.811 --> 24:13.371
So, listen.

24:13.451 --> 24:15.771
Thanks so much.
My friend's gonna be so...

24:15.851 --> 24:18.611
He's gonna be so happy
cos he's only got a small TV.

24:18.691 --> 24:21.051
I said he should get a bigger one.
Your friend?

24:21.131 --> 24:23.091
Yeah. Jim.

24:25.051 --> 24:27.331
I already know, Bishop.

24:28.811 --> 24:29.971
Pike.

24:30.051 --> 24:32.331
No, I saw Sophie walk into the
building.

24:32.411 --> 24:34.131
She told me.

24:37.051 --> 24:39.051
It happens, you know?

24:40.371 --> 24:42.131
People change.

24:42.811 --> 24:45.411
People move on, fall in love.

24:48.091 --> 24:50.611
We come and go.
You know, nothing's forever.

24:52.971 --> 24:54.971
The most important thing is...

24:59.171 --> 25:00.651
There's no shame in it.

25:07.131 --> 25:09.451
I just don't know
what I'm gonna do, Nell.

25:23.011 --> 25:25.611
Armed robbery.
Suspects murdered.

25:26.611 --> 25:28.371
It doesn't go unnoticed.

25:29.691 --> 25:31.691
He just wants to say hello.

25:31.771 --> 25:33.771
Full update and debrief, then, yeah?

25:37.131 --> 25:38.611
You all right, Dad?

25:38.691 --> 25:39.771
Son.

25:46.811 --> 25:48.811
Sorry I'm late. Aaron.

25:48.891 --> 25:49.931
Sir.

26:04.411 --> 26:06.651
If you were to profile Sharp,

26:06.731 --> 26:10.131
what would you say
defines his character?

26:10.211 --> 26:11.931
He's no slouch.

26:12.011 --> 26:13.971
He doesn't like to get his hands
dirty.

26:14.051 --> 26:16.251
Meticulous character.
Well trained.

26:16.331 --> 26:19.691
Managed to get out of the facility
without any of us knowing.

26:19.771 --> 26:22.091
No-one else did. That took skill.

26:22.171 --> 26:24.091
Skill indeed.

26:26.491 --> 26:29.131
Double tap head shots.

26:29.211 --> 26:31.251
Nice, clean job.

26:31.331 --> 26:32.611
Efficient.

26:32.691 --> 26:36.171
One man in custody, yes?
Heading up there now.

26:36.251 --> 26:38.011
Mm. We'll make him talk.

26:38.091 --> 26:39.891
Want a tip?

26:39.971 --> 26:43.051
Take these.
They'll help focus his mind.

26:44.971 --> 26:47.051
Interesting character, this Sharp.

26:48.491 --> 26:50.611
He's slipped through our nets
before.

26:50.691 --> 26:52.731
We must not let it happen again.

26:53.371 --> 26:56.051
Tanner, I'm not too sure
about the dog.

26:56.131 --> 26:58.651
I think it sends out
the wrong message.

27:00.051 --> 27:03.811
Sorry to say this, Pike, but I'm not
sure I like your father anymore.

27:05.211 --> 27:07.851
I think you need to have
a proper talk with your dad.

27:07.931 --> 27:10.091
He's always got to be involved
in everything.

27:10.171 --> 27:13.371
I just think he doesn't want Sharp
to get the better of us again.

27:13.451 --> 27:14.991
Yeah, but it doesn't
give him the

27:15.004 --> 27:16.691
right to get involved
in everything.

27:16.771 --> 27:19.571
I thought he was gonna offer
to change your nappy in there.

27:19.651 --> 27:21.611
You said.
This the new car, yeah?

27:21.691 --> 27:24.971
Yeah, man. Friends in high places.
You know how we roll, bro.

27:26.011 --> 27:29.251
I don't like it.
What? Get inside the car, man.

27:29.331 --> 27:30.771
No, man. Look at it.

27:30.851 --> 27:32.891
I liked the Mini better,
to be honest.

27:52.771 --> 27:54.651
You thinking what I'm thinking?

27:54.731 --> 27:57.491
I'm thinking Sharp is out there
looking for something

27:57.571 --> 27:59.651
or cleaning up after himself.

28:00.451 --> 28:03.051
He doesn't give a shit about
the jewels.

28:03.131 --> 28:06.811
He killed your friends
and he's coming after you next.

28:06.891 --> 28:09.291
He doesn't let anything get in his
way.

28:09.371 --> 28:11.171
Not even the fact that you're in
here.

28:11.251 --> 28:13.971
Sharp. Help us find him.

28:15.291 --> 28:19.211
And then we talk reduction. And -
And keeping you alive.

28:19.291 --> 28:22.451
Bruv, I was gonna say that.
I beat you to it.

28:22.531 --> 28:25.091
Why you got to take my sentence...
Bro. Come on. Ssh.

28:25.171 --> 28:27.011
Oh...

28:31.411 --> 28:34.491
The fourth man.
Called himself Ray.

28:35.491 --> 28:37.891
He's the one you want.
What about Sharp?

28:38.891 --> 28:41.411
I've never heard of Sharp,
but Ray put it together.

28:42.211 --> 28:43.731
Said we could take what we wanted.

28:43.811 --> 28:46.091
He was only interested
in one deposit box.

28:46.931 --> 28:48.971
What was in the deposit box?

28:49.051 --> 28:50.559
What was so valuable
that Ray went to

28:50.572 --> 28:52.131
all this trouble
setting up a robbery?

28:52.211 --> 28:56.451
Search me.
This "Ray"... Tell me more.

28:58.971 --> 29:03.251
He had that er... skin disease
when... when skin bleaches.

29:03.331 --> 29:06.011
What you talking about? Vitiligo?

29:06.091 --> 29:08.171
Michael Jackson had it.

29:08.251 --> 29:10.691
And now I suppose he's disappeared
without a trace?

29:10.771 --> 29:13.651
Who, the King of Pop?
No, he's dead.

29:15.531 --> 29:17.651
Listen!
Don't mess around with me, man.

29:17.731 --> 29:20.651
Now, you may not want to
put Sharp on that work.

29:20.731 --> 29:22.611
But we will.

29:25.211 --> 29:27.091
And you see that?

29:27.171 --> 29:28.371
That's you.

29:31.811 --> 29:33.611
He's pissed.

29:37.971 --> 29:40.291
Your man's telling the truth
about one thing.

29:40.371 --> 29:43.131
This Ray character
is only interested in one box.

29:44.531 --> 29:46.051
You still there?

29:46.131 --> 29:48.971
Yeah, just trying to work out
what the hell's going on.

29:49.771 --> 29:52.531
But why would you do an armed
robbery just to get one box?

29:52.611 --> 29:55.691
And if Sharp wasn't involved,
what was he doing there?

29:55.771 --> 29:58.051
So, what, you telling me that's it,
yeah?

29:58.131 --> 30:01.091
Armed robbery, two dead bodies,
one suspect in custody -

30:01.171 --> 30:02.971
and we can't sew this thing together?

30:03.051 --> 30:06.411
Maybe Barton's info's good.
Maybe Ray is behind the whole thing.

30:06.491 --> 30:09.611
Fuck Ray. Focus on Sharp.
We ain't letting him get away again.

30:09.691 --> 30:11.560
Where are we on the tube stations?
One

30:11.573 --> 30:13.211
camera must have
picked up Sharp.

30:13.291 --> 30:16.691
270 tube stations. So? What the fuck
does that mean, Kamali?

30:16.771 --> 30:18.811
Means we're nowhere, Bishop.

30:18.891 --> 30:21.571
The suitcase he dumped
is just overnight stuff.

30:21.651 --> 30:23.731
And the flat cap he dumped
is just a flat cap.

30:23.811 --> 30:26.011
He dumped his case.
He dumped his cap.

30:26.091 --> 30:28.331
It's almost like he's shedding
his skin.

30:30.091 --> 30:31.531
Kamali.

30:31.611 --> 30:33.771
Get onto London Underground
lost property.

30:33.851 --> 30:36.411
Find out if someone handed in
a navy overcoat.

30:36.491 --> 30:38.171
On it.

30:44.891 --> 30:46.451
Sophie.

30:46.531 --> 30:48.411
You all right?

30:48.491 --> 30:49.971
Yeah, man.

30:55.331 --> 30:57.331
I'm telling you, Bish.

30:57.411 --> 30:59.371
It was Sharp, I know it.

31:02.491 --> 31:03.731
Mm.

31:08.211 --> 31:10.211
What you gonna do, bro? About?

31:10.291 --> 31:12.251
Sophie. You have to talk to her.

31:14.491 --> 31:16.811
I got my TV back, man.
That's all I wanted.

31:19.291 --> 31:21.411
What about him?
What about Jonesy?

31:22.691 --> 31:25.371
He's gonna be out of hospital soon,
back at work.

31:26.251 --> 31:28.731
What are you gonna do, ignore him?
Gonna quit?

31:32.771 --> 31:34.771
The man slept with my girl.

31:35.651 --> 31:38.571
Oh, I love you, bro,
but don't be around when I see him.

31:47.091 --> 31:48.371
Yes, Nell?

31:52.011 --> 31:53.571
All right, cool. Thank you.

31:54.931 --> 31:57.531
They've found Sharp's jacket
at Canary Wharf Station.

31:57.611 --> 31:59.491
Shall we go get it?

32:05.451 --> 32:06.851
Oi!

32:07.531 --> 32:10.611
Have you got it, yeah?
Yeah, man. What you saying?

32:19.531 --> 32:22.291
He entered a car hire place
near Canary Wharf

32:22.371 --> 32:25.691
and hired a Lexus
under the name James Moore.

32:25.771 --> 32:28.047
Unfortunately for
him, any car over 40

32:28.060 --> 32:30.171
grand is fitted
with a transponder.

32:30.251 --> 32:32.171
Sharp headed towards Thetford
Forest.

32:32.251 --> 32:35.131
There's no GPS in there but I've got
a satellite thermal image.

32:35.211 --> 32:39.091
There are several properties,
but only two show signs of life.

32:39.171 --> 32:40.864
Sharp's wanted by
Europol for the

32:40.877 --> 32:42.731
shooting of a traffic
cop last year.

32:42.811 --> 32:44.771
Approach with extreme caution.

32:44.851 --> 32:48.691
Don't let this bastard get away
again.

32:48.771 --> 32:50.291
OK, got that?

32:50.371 --> 32:52.011
Yeah, man, got it.

32:52.091 --> 32:54.051
Let's do this.

33:00.466 --> 33:00.571
Stay with her! Stay with her!

33:16.402 --> 33:18.762
Yo, Pike. What?

33:18.842 --> 33:20.882
I'm not really feeling this, you
know.

33:20.962 --> 33:24.082
Black men ain't supposed to be
in the woods, you know that.

33:24.162 --> 33:26.122
Man, shut up.

33:46.922 --> 33:48.922
See it there?

33:50.362 --> 33:53.242
You wanna lead?
Nah, I'm good, you know.

33:54.762 --> 33:56.402
One room.

33:56.482 --> 33:58.402
I say we just blast in there
and grab him.

33:59.242 --> 34:01.322
You obviously thought that one
through.

34:01.402 --> 34:04.202
You got a better idea? No.

34:04.282 --> 34:06.162
So?

34:23.522 --> 34:26.282
What the fuck? It's a pig!

34:31.882 --> 34:33.882
Ah, man.

34:39.322 --> 34:40.522
Oi! What?

34:40.601 --> 34:42.322
What you doing, man?

34:45.081 --> 34:46.641
It's Sharp's hire car.

34:46.722 --> 34:49.042
What? The Lexus!

34:49.121 --> 34:51.161
Yeah, come on, man.
It's the guy's.

34:56.161 --> 34:58.162
Go round the back.

35:09.042 --> 35:10.322
Pike!

35:13.962 --> 35:16.282
Put the gun down, Sharp.
It's over.

35:17.442 --> 35:19.882
Shoot him, bruv.
I said, put the gun down!

35:19.962 --> 35:21.922
Badge. I wanna see it.

35:22.002 --> 35:23.682
Shoot him! Shut up!

35:23.762 --> 35:27.642
Why do you wanna see my badge?
I need to know you're police.

35:31.202 --> 35:32.682
Slowly!

35:36.762 --> 35:37.962
OK?

35:39.162 --> 35:40.962
Thank God for that, eh? Mm.

35:41.042 --> 35:44.402
Put the gun down. OK. Slowly.

35:44.482 --> 35:46.722
I'm all yours.

35:48.482 --> 35:49.802
Thank you.

35:52.762 --> 35:56.682
Michael Sharp, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of armed robbery.

35:56.762 --> 35:59.242
I wasn't on that robbery.
I was trying to stop it.

35:59.322 --> 36:01.402
Stand back!

36:02.922 --> 36:05.002
It was my deposit box that
they stole.

36:06.642 --> 36:10.242
Do you really think that I would
come back after all this time

36:10.322 --> 36:11.842
to steal some fucking diamonds?

36:11.922 --> 36:14.522
Bruv, you're gonna have to
do better than that, yeah?

36:16.282 --> 36:17.722
Oi.

36:20.802 --> 36:22.402
Think about it.

36:22.482 --> 36:25.162
I get a tip-off a few days ago
about the robbery,

36:25.242 --> 36:28.522
I fly back to get my D-box
and I'm too late.

36:29.242 --> 36:31.922
What was in it that was so valuable
they wanted to steal it?

36:32.002 --> 36:33.562
Evidence.

36:34.442 --> 36:36.202
Valuable enough to keep me alive.

36:36.282 --> 36:38.242
What evidence?

36:41.282 --> 36:43.202
You haven't got a clue, have you?

36:46.082 --> 36:48.242
You don't know what you're dealing
with.

36:48.322 --> 36:51.482
Well, we're not going anywhere.

36:53.922 --> 36:57.722
Fucking hell, boys.
You're in for one hell of a treat.

36:57.802 --> 36:59.802
Bruv, you're really
starting to piss me off.

36:59.882 --> 37:02.602
What fucking evidence?
Arrest me and I'll tell you.

37:02.682 --> 37:05.682
It's your duty.
Take me in. Protect me.

37:07.162 --> 37:08.722
That's the law.

37:09.802 --> 37:14.882
Now that my insurance policy
has been stolen... I'm disposable.

37:14.962 --> 37:17.562
Who wants to dispose of you?
I can think of a couple...

37:17.642 --> 37:18.722
Brother... Shh!

37:24.762 --> 37:26.602
Look...

37:28.002 --> 37:32.122
Just take me in and I'll tell you
everything that you need to know.

37:32.202 --> 37:34.562
But quickly -
if you can find me, so can they.

37:34.642 --> 37:36.242
Who's they? The clock's ticking.

37:36.322 --> 37:38.442
Before? I'm disposed of.

37:38.522 --> 37:40.762
We're too late!

37:40.842 --> 37:42.802
Come on! Go! Go! Go!

37:45.722 --> 37:47.562
Run! Come on!

37:49.482 --> 37:50.562
Cover!

37:52.522 --> 37:54.522
Go! Go!

37:56.922 --> 37:58.802
Cover! Cover!

38:04.522 --> 38:05.882
Cover!

38:11.482 --> 38:13.842
Cover! Cover!

38:13.922 --> 38:16.162
Come on, you fucking slowcoach!

38:25.042 --> 38:27.242
Oh, shit.

38:29.242 --> 38:31.202
Oh, man.

38:33.442 --> 38:36.122
Where's the car, man?
I don't fucking know, bro.

38:36.202 --> 38:38.842
What do you mean, you don't know?
Are you two for real?

38:38.922 --> 38:40.882
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

38:45.242 --> 38:47.842
Bishop, speak to me.
What's the latest?

38:47.922 --> 38:50.042
You might want to get a bird up
with a heat seeker.

38:50.122 --> 38:53.562
There's a gunman with a
semi-automatic out there. Oh, yeah,

38:53.642 --> 38:56.442
we apprehended a very scrawny
and forgettable-looking suspect.

38:56.522 --> 38:59.602
We're dragging him back to custody.
Yes!

39:00.242 --> 39:03.322
Scrawny?
Bit rich coming from you, innit?

39:03.402 --> 39:05.122
Shut up, man!

39:07.562 --> 39:10.162
Won't be saying that when you hear
the tale I have to tell.

39:10.242 --> 39:13.162
You better start talking,
because we have a two-hour drive.

39:13.242 --> 39:15.762
Make that one, mate.
Pike, don't drive crazy, man.

39:15.842 --> 39:17.802
I get road sick.
Just chill out, man.

39:17.882 --> 39:20.562
Yeah, we do the deal BEFORE I sing.
Deal?

39:20.642 --> 39:22.242
Ain't no fucking...

40:28.562 --> 40:30.042
Agh!

41:00.002 --> 41:02.322
It's all right. It's OK.

41:32.282 --> 41:34.202
Do you love her, Jonesy?

41:36.322 --> 41:38.122
I do, Bishop.

41:38.882 --> 41:40.482
Yeah.

42:15.082 --> 42:17.362
What do you think "access denied"
means?

42:17.442 --> 42:19.522
It means we're no longer on the case.

42:19.602 --> 42:21.202
Bruv, we could've been killed.

42:21.282 --> 42:22.722
So why weren't we?

42:22.802 --> 42:25.762
And what the fuck did Sharp
have to say that was so important?

42:25.842 --> 42:26.962
He was laughing at us.

42:27.042 --> 42:28.801
We're dumped off the
Sharp case to look

42:28.814 --> 42:30.362
for plants? We're
Organised Crime.

42:30.442 --> 42:31.722
Yeah, not Gardeners' World.

42:31.802 --> 42:33.242
This stays low.

42:33.322 --> 42:35.282
No-one else knows, but we don't stop.

42:36.642 --> 42:38.484
A 15-year-old
shouldn't be dealing

42:38.497 --> 42:40.402
drugs. Let this be
a lesson to you.

42:40.482 --> 42:42.682
The brief leaves
and the social worker arrives.

42:42.762 --> 42:44.602
We beat the shit out of him
until he tells us

42:44.682 --> 42:46.842
the location of
Jason Woods' drug factory.

42:46.922 --> 42:48.642
Can I file that in my report?

42:48.722 --> 42:51.402
Scarlett Nugent.
Ryan Obora's social worker.

42:51.482 --> 42:53.722
Keep talking to him like he's five,
he'll act up!

42:53.802 --> 42:55.122
What are you doing?

42:56.242 --> 42:57.842
You like him?

42:57.922 --> 42:59.562
I'm just saying he cares.

42:59.642 --> 43:01.442
School of hard knocks, kid.

43:01.522 --> 43:03.402
Jason Woods. Where is he?

43:03.482 --> 43:04.962
Agh!

43:06.002 --> 43:07.122
Kamali?

43:07.202 --> 43:08.442
And how was your night?

43:08.522 --> 43:10.202
Colourful.
