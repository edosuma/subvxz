00:08.306 --> 00:10.040
Hey, no skating inside.

00:23.721 --> 00:24.921
Ruben...

00:26.524 --> 00:27.791
Where's that game
thing I bought you?

00:28.468 --> 00:29.835
I left it at home

00:29.870 --> 00:31.470
'cause I didn't know you were
gonna take me out of camp.

00:32.572 --> 00:33.706
Camp?

00:34.641 --> 00:36.342
You have him in camp?!

00:36.376 --> 00:37.576
Not anymore.

00:39.846 --> 00:40.813
What?

00:40.847 --> 00:43.482
Hey, kid.

00:43.517 --> 00:44.750
Hi. Yeah. Listen up.

00:44.785 --> 00:45.951
Uh...

00:45.986 --> 00:47.386
Look, I want you to go
over there with buzz,

00:47.421 --> 00:49.155
and he's gonna pull
something up on the Internet

00:49.189 --> 00:51.157
for you to do. Hmm? You're bossy.

00:51.191 --> 00:52.691
Get. Huh?

00:52.726 --> 00:55.327
Ruben! I said no skating inside!

01:09.609 --> 01:11.143
Look.

01:11.178 --> 01:13.679
E-emergencies happen
when you have kids.

01:13.713 --> 01:15.648
Well, you don't have kids, Julio.

01:15.682 --> 01:17.683
Tao has kids. I have kids.

01:17.717 --> 01:19.785
You have someone else's kid.

01:19.820 --> 01:21.754
That's completely different.

01:21.788 --> 01:23.322
W-what's this camp?

01:23.356 --> 01:24.723
It's all-day sports.

01:24.758 --> 01:27.393
I-I just thought that I
would find a safe place

01:27.427 --> 01:29.028
where Ruben could play all day.

01:29.062 --> 01:30.229
But get this.

01:30.263 --> 01:31.597
The camp's soccer coach

01:31.631 --> 01:33.766
was convicted of shoplifting two...

01:33.800 --> 01:35.768
wait, wait, wait! Are you...

01:35.802 --> 01:38.571
are you telling me that you did
an illegal background check

01:38.605 --> 01:39.805
on this guy?

01:39.840 --> 01:41.774
No.

01:41.808 --> 01:44.443
His car looked suspicious,

01:44.478 --> 01:45.711
so I ran his plates.

01:45.745 --> 01:46.979
Oh, bullshit. No, I...

01:47.013 --> 01:48.347
how stupid do you think I am?

01:48.381 --> 01:50.182
I got to look after this kid
until I find his mother!

01:50.217 --> 01:51.584
Well, what about
finding his mother?

01:51.618 --> 01:53.185
Why is that taking you so long?
What's the hold-up?

01:53.220 --> 01:54.186
I don't know.

01:54.221 --> 01:55.955
I'm calling Mexican
law enforcement.

01:55.989 --> 01:58.224
I'm doing Internet
searches for family members.

01:58.258 --> 01:59.725
I'm trying everything that I can!

01:59.759 --> 02:01.527
All right.

02:01.561 --> 02:02.895
You know what, Julio?

02:02.929 --> 02:05.564
J, uh...

02:05.599 --> 02:07.133
I think you need some help.

02:08.467 --> 02:10.803
Lieutenant Andy Flynn.

02:10.836 --> 02:12.338
Major crimes. How can I help you?

02:12.372 --> 02:14.240
Oh, hey, Mikki. How you doing?

02:14.274 --> 02:15.774
Oh.

02:15.809 --> 02:18.110
Is this like...
Body parts from one person?

02:18.145 --> 02:21.447
Body parts?

02:21.481 --> 02:24.283
Call the chief.

02:26.153 --> 02:27.119
So, um...

02:28.155 --> 02:31.123
...Human remains in a bag?

02:31.158 --> 02:32.658
What kind of bag?

03:01.254 --> 03:04.023
Give me one second. Okay?

03:06.726 --> 03:08.227
Oh.

03:08.261 --> 03:10.496
Thank you, Detective Mendoza.

03:10.530 --> 03:11.730
My pleasure, chief.

03:12.866 --> 03:15.334
Hmm. You are looking
better than ever.

03:15.368 --> 03:17.203
Oh. Thank you.

03:17.237 --> 03:19.205
Uh...Thanks.

03:19.239 --> 03:21.473
Sorry to call you out
on something like this,

03:21.508 --> 03:23.342
but I think the
circumstances demand it.

03:23.376 --> 03:24.810
What circumstances?

03:24.844 --> 03:26.579
Two months ago,
a few blocks from here,

03:26.613 --> 03:28.214
we found a trash bag in a dumpster

03:28.248 --> 03:29.782
with a hacked-up body inside it.

03:29.816 --> 03:31.750
Except the head and the
hands were missing.

03:31.785 --> 03:33.886
We entered murder
details into vicap.

03:33.920 --> 03:36.155
Some good matches with
some cartel killings

03:36.189 --> 03:37.423
in San Diego and Phoenix.

03:37.457 --> 03:39.692
Wait. So the cartel
filled garbage bags

03:39.726 --> 03:41.093
with hacked-up bodies?

03:41.127 --> 03:42.428
Without the hands and head?

03:42.462 --> 03:43.996
The hands were there...

03:44.030 --> 03:45.998
And the skulls,
but the faces had been cut off.

03:46.032 --> 03:48.867
And three weeks ago,
we found another bag like this one.

03:48.902 --> 03:50.069
No head. No hands.

03:50.103 --> 03:51.737
This one here makes three.

03:51.771 --> 03:53.606
Lieutenant Tao,
did you find a head in there

03:53.640 --> 03:54.707
or some hands?

03:54.741 --> 03:56.475
Definitely no head,

03:56.509 --> 03:58.010
but not sure about the hands.

03:58.044 --> 03:59.211
Okay.

03:59.246 --> 04:00.746
I can do that for you, ma'am.

04:00.780 --> 04:02.881
Oh...That's not necessary.

04:02.916 --> 04:06.118
So, did you take DNA samples
from the other bodies?

04:06.152 --> 04:07.219
Yes, ma'am. No hits yet.

04:07.254 --> 04:08.821
Okay. So, three victims.

04:08.855 --> 04:11.790
I assume the others are
still at the morgue?

04:11.825 --> 04:13.726
No head, no hands,
no funeral service.

04:13.760 --> 04:18.197
So, San Diego, Phoenix,
and now Los Angeles.

04:18.231 --> 04:21.333
Sounds like the cartel
activity is headed north,

04:21.368 --> 04:23.869
and this is gang territory.

04:23.903 --> 04:26.238
Is the gang in this neighborhood
even connected to cartels?

04:26.273 --> 04:29.875
Where's Detective Sanchez?
And lieutenant Provenza?

04:29.909 --> 04:31.777
Checking on another missing person.

04:31.811 --> 04:32.911
Still?!

04:32.946 --> 04:35.314
I know the local gang.
The six points.

04:35.348 --> 04:38.117
No cartel connections,
but maybe they're seen as competition.

04:38.151 --> 04:39.285
Mendoza!

04:39.319 --> 04:41.020
Who do you think you are?

04:41.054 --> 04:42.388
Excuse me, sir?

04:43.923 --> 04:47.092
You have no authority to
transfer cases to major crimes

04:47.127 --> 04:48.039
without going through me.

04:48.040 --> 04:49.540
Our watch commander
told us to contact you,

04:49.574 --> 04:51.008
but no one could find your office.

04:51.043 --> 04:53.077
The clock was ticking. I thought...

04:53.111 --> 04:54.612
Uh, excuse me, commander.
One second.

04:54.646 --> 04:55.780
Detective Mendoza,

04:55.814 --> 04:57.515
just to be clear,
in the last two months,

04:57.549 --> 04:59.817
you found three victims
hacked up into pieces

04:59.851 --> 05:02.953
and tossed into trash bags in
local dumpsters? Yes, ma'am.

05:02.988 --> 05:04.789
I think it's fair to
call this a major crime,

05:04.823 --> 05:05.923
commander, don't you?

05:05.957 --> 05:07.525
Well yeah.

05:07.559 --> 05:10.294
But I should have been the
one to tell you, not her.

05:10.328 --> 05:12.530
Detective Mendoza,
thank you so much for your help.

05:12.564 --> 05:13.798
We'll take it from here.

05:13.832 --> 05:15.199
Glad to help you, ma'am.

05:15.233 --> 05:16.200
And always, good to see you.

05:16.234 --> 05:18.035
Thank you.

05:19.201 --> 05:20.401
Oh, by the way,

05:20.436 --> 05:21.970
good luck on the chief sweepstakes.

05:22.004 --> 05:24.572
You'd look even better
sitting behind the big desk.

05:32.627 --> 05:35.162
And what did she mean by that?

05:35.196 --> 05:36.663
I don't know.

05:38.887 --> 05:41.522
Oh! I applied for chief of police.

05:41.556 --> 05:43.490
You applied for chief?

05:43.525 --> 05:44.447
That's not how I should
find out about that, either.

05:44.475 --> 05:45.842
Right now we should
be concentrating

05:45.877 --> 05:47.143
on what I want to find out. Okay?

05:48.487 --> 05:49.520
Uh, lieutenant Flynn,

05:49.555 --> 05:51.355
would you please
organize a grid search

05:51.390 --> 05:53.491
to find the missing body
parts from that bag?

05:53.525 --> 05:55.159
The last thing I
need is for some dog

05:55.194 --> 05:57.929
to show up dragging a head
down the middle of the street.

05:59.203 --> 06:01.437
Okay. Okay. Let's go. Let's go.

06:01.472 --> 06:03.506
Thank y'all so much.

06:03.540 --> 06:07.643
What on earth made
you apply for chief?

06:07.678 --> 06:09.645
I told her to.

06:09.680 --> 06:12.181
She was drafted by the
L.A.P.D.'S women's work group,

06:12.216 --> 06:14.016
and I thought she
should go with it.

06:14.051 --> 06:16.519
So now, she's one of the
27 billion other people

06:16.553 --> 06:17.787
who have applied for the job,

06:17.821 --> 06:19.021
which means I'm not the slam dunk

06:19.056 --> 06:20.356
we all hoped I'd be.

06:20.390 --> 06:21.557
And the last thing I need

06:21.592 --> 06:23.526
is for hacked-up
bodies in garbage bags

06:23.560 --> 06:25.495
to be the lead story
on tonight's news.

06:25.529 --> 06:27.029
Well, lucky for us,

06:27.064 --> 06:29.198
the press doesn't care about
murders in that neighborhood.

06:29.233 --> 06:30.867
Yeah, and to keep it that way,

06:30.901 --> 06:32.835
here's a list of words
I'd like to not hear

06:32.870 --> 06:33.936
during this investigation...

06:33.971 --> 06:36.773
Mexican cartel murders,
bag of bones,

06:36.807 --> 06:37.774
serial killer.

06:37.808 --> 06:40.309
I don't want these
cases sensationalized.

06:40.344 --> 06:41.711
But the M.O. here is very similar

06:41.745 --> 06:42.979
to the Mexican cartel murders.

06:43.013 --> 06:44.213
Look, they're called
Mexican cartel murders

06:44.248 --> 06:46.015
because they happen in Mexico.

06:46.049 --> 06:48.351
As of now, you don't even know
where these victims are from,

06:48.385 --> 06:49.385
let alone who they are.

06:49.419 --> 06:54.524
Meet Juan Doe 102, 106, and 107.

06:54.558 --> 06:57.026
From what I can tell so far,
all of them adolescent males.

06:57.060 --> 06:59.328
I didn't conduct the
original autopsy

06:59.363 --> 07:00.596
on your other victims,

07:00.631 --> 07:02.965
but let me see if I can put
something together for you.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.735
Do the bodies have any
identifying characteristics?

07:05.769 --> 07:08.271
Based on their skin color,
I would say they were Latino,

07:08.305 --> 07:11.541
but I don't want to be
accused of racial profiling.

07:11.575 --> 07:13.843
They could be gang members.

07:13.877 --> 07:15.211
No.

07:15.245 --> 07:16.212
But...

07:16.246 --> 07:18.314
No. I don't see tattoos.

07:18.348 --> 07:21.717
So, what... you're saying there's -
there's nothing.

07:21.752 --> 07:23.619
Oh. Not so fast.

07:23.654 --> 07:24.887
I looked over the x-rays

07:24.922 --> 07:27.223
from the first victim
that Mendoza brought in

07:27.257 --> 07:28.691
a couple of months ago,

07:28.725 --> 07:31.360
and I found something
the other doctor missed.

07:34.031 --> 07:35.198
What is that?

07:35.232 --> 07:36.899
A radiolucent ankle pin,

07:36.934 --> 07:39.168
made from material easy
to miss on an X-ray.

07:39.203 --> 07:40.870
FDA just approved it last year,

07:40.904 --> 07:42.772
and it's not the kind
of medical treatment

07:42.806 --> 07:44.707
you're likely to
find in Mexico yet.

07:44.741 --> 07:46.843
Okay, and which suggests that
at least one of our victims

07:46.877 --> 07:48.077
is from here.

07:49.146 --> 07:51.180
Thank you, doctor.

07:51.215 --> 07:52.648
Ohh.

07:52.683 --> 07:55.218
All I need is for one of
these missing persons reports

07:55.252 --> 07:57.920
to mention a broken ankle

07:57.955 --> 07:59.589
or... or a twisted
foot or something.

07:59.623 --> 08:00.656
Are you done eating yet?

08:00.691 --> 08:02.558
Because these autopsy photos

08:02.593 --> 08:05.261
of the victims from San Diego
and Phoenix are bad.

08:05.295 --> 08:07.029
Trust me... after what I saw today,

08:07.064 --> 08:08.497
nothing will faze me.

08:08.532 --> 08:10.700
Look, why... why don't...

08:10.734 --> 08:14.570
...You start sorting through
these missing persons files,

08:14.605 --> 08:17.340
and I'll start sorting
through these?

08:18.775 --> 08:21.143
What is that?! What?

08:21.979 --> 08:23.746
Oh, that's a soccer ball

08:23.780 --> 08:25.882
with one of the victim's
faces stitched onto it.

08:26.984 --> 08:28.251
An FBI source gave us that photo

08:28.285 --> 08:29.385
after the ball was found

08:29.419 --> 08:31.621
rolling around city hall in Juarez.

08:31.655 --> 08:34.423
Ohh. Detective Mendoza didn't
say anything about that.

08:36.659 --> 08:38.461
What did Sanchez say

08:38.495 --> 08:39.794
about the gangs in the area?

08:39.830 --> 08:41.397
Sanchez wasn't there.

08:41.431 --> 08:44.700
He's still allegedly
looking for Ruben's mom.

08:44.735 --> 08:46.402
Might have been easier for him

08:46.436 --> 08:48.271
if I hadn't killed the kid's dad.

08:51.708 --> 08:53.309
Any way I can help?

08:53.343 --> 08:55.211
Talk to Provenza about it.

08:55.245 --> 08:56.746
Would you? Please?

08:56.780 --> 08:58.381
I'm staying out of it, if I can.

09:01.184 --> 09:02.485
What's that?

09:02.519 --> 09:03.786
Missing 17-year-old boy.

09:03.820 --> 09:06.589
There's a little box checked there,

09:06.623 --> 09:10.092
indicating a scar on his ankle.

09:12.829 --> 09:14.230
His name is Pedro Mota.

09:14.264 --> 09:16.599
Reported missing 10 days ago by his mother.

09:16.633 --> 09:19.168
The body was found in six
points gang territory.

09:19.202 --> 09:21.203
But this is Detective
Mendoza's first victim,

09:21.238 --> 09:23.005
picked out of the
trash two months ago.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.974
Why'd his mother wait
so long to call it in?

09:25.008 --> 09:26.509
Maybe she thought
Pedro was in jail.

09:26.543 --> 09:28.144
He has the résumé.

09:28.178 --> 09:30.346
Last year, Pedro was
arrested in the gang rape

09:30.380 --> 09:31.447
of a 12-year-old girl.

09:31.481 --> 09:33.282
For some reason,
she couldn't testify,

09:33.317 --> 09:34.350
so Pedro walked.

09:34.384 --> 09:36.018
Charmin'.

09:36.053 --> 09:38.521
Well, maybe I should...

09:38.555 --> 09:40.856
Maybe I should talk to this mother.

09:40.891 --> 09:44.794
I had her picked up, chief.
She should be here any second.

09:44.828 --> 09:46.529
Well, that's one mother
you found awfully quick.

09:46.563 --> 09:47.830
Thank you, lieutenant.

09:48.899 --> 09:52.768
Chief, if this is a
gang or a cartel thing

09:52.803 --> 09:55.371
and Pedro is the victim,
then something's weird.

09:55.405 --> 09:56.872
And what would that be?

09:56.907 --> 10:00.042
Well, the six points deal
prescription drugs...

10:00.077 --> 10:01.877
Oxycontin, Vicodin, Percocet.

10:01.912 --> 10:03.212
They stay away from cartel product.

10:03.246 --> 10:04.213
No coke and no pot.

10:04.247 --> 10:06.215
Whatever Pedro's done,

10:06.249 --> 10:07.450
it's not my fault.

10:07.484 --> 10:08.784
Mrs. Mota?

10:10.520 --> 10:12.288
Thank you so much for coming in.

10:12.322 --> 10:13.756
I'm deputy chief Johnson.

10:13.790 --> 10:15.858
Why don't we go into
my office to talk?

10:15.892 --> 10:17.159
Detective Sanchez?
Detective Gabriel?

10:17.194 --> 10:18.828
Right this way.

10:21.932 --> 10:25.134
You know, I can't believe
she didn't mention

10:25.168 --> 10:26.502
the whole "chief" thing.

10:26.536 --> 10:28.037
Well, it's... it's all politics.

10:28.071 --> 10:29.739
Which means we're not
gonna get involved.

10:29.773 --> 10:31.407
I don't want to hear another
word about this from anybody.

10:31.441 --> 10:32.675
I-is that clear?

10:32.709 --> 10:33.976
You're not even gonna
ask her about it?

10:34.011 --> 10:35.211
No.

10:35.245 --> 10:37.680
And neither are you.

10:40.450 --> 10:42.585
We have enough problems
around here as it is.

10:46.774 --> 10:49.143
I don't care if you
find Pedro or not.

10:49.177 --> 10:51.378
Things are better without him.

10:51.412 --> 10:52.746
Then why did you file a
missing persons report?

10:52.780 --> 10:55.149
The money.

10:55.183 --> 10:56.483
What money?

10:56.518 --> 10:58.619
That nosy welfare
lady showed up again,

10:58.653 --> 11:01.421
unannounced, doing her little
"inspection."

11:01.456 --> 11:03.056
She asked where Pedro was,

11:03.091 --> 11:05.025
and I mentioned I haven't
seen him in a while.

11:05.059 --> 11:07.728
So the bitch threatens to
cancel my monthly check

11:07.762 --> 11:09.496
if I don't report him missing?!

11:09.531 --> 11:12.733
She's like, "he's only a teenager.

11:12.767 --> 11:14.835
He shouldn't be gone like this."

11:14.869 --> 11:17.971
So, I called the police.

11:18.006 --> 11:19.806
Now I, like, still get my check,

11:19.841 --> 11:22.409
and I don't have to look
at Pedro's stupid face.

11:23.611 --> 11:26.647
And when was the last time you
saw your son's "stupid face"?

11:26.681 --> 11:27.881
I don't know.

11:29.617 --> 11:32.386
Right after school ended.
Something like that.

11:32.420 --> 11:33.754
That was two months ago.

11:33.788 --> 11:35.789
You didn't think that was worth
mentioning to the police?

11:35.823 --> 11:37.658
Oh, look. I tried to
make good with Pedro,

11:37.692 --> 11:38.759
but he don't listen.

11:38.793 --> 11:41.495
I'm not dealing with
his crap no more!

11:41.529 --> 11:43.297
So what do you think happens
to this welfare check

11:43.331 --> 11:44.298
if your son turns up dead?

11:44.332 --> 11:45.966
Dead?

11:47.402 --> 11:49.836
Pedro wasn't dead. He was just...

11:49.871 --> 11:51.371
Bleeding a little.

11:51.406 --> 11:52.839
What do you mean "bleeding"?

11:55.476 --> 11:57.477
He got into some
stupid knife fight,

11:57.512 --> 11:59.546
and I had to stop
everything I was doing

11:59.581 --> 12:01.048
to take him to that clinic.

12:01.082 --> 12:02.482
Would this be the same clinic

12:02.517 --> 12:04.451
where he got a pin
put in his ankle?

12:08.156 --> 12:09.590
How'd you know about that?

12:09.624 --> 12:11.258
I-I need the name of
this clinic, please.

12:14.963 --> 12:16.530
Pedro Mota.

12:16.564 --> 12:17.598
Um, yeah, yeah, I did.

12:17.632 --> 12:19.733
I treated him just
for a knife wound.

12:19.767 --> 12:21.635
And there was something
odd about it, too.

12:21.669 --> 12:23.437
I-I can't remember what it was.

12:23.471 --> 12:25.372
Is Pedro a regular patient here?

12:25.406 --> 12:27.140
See, I'm also interested in a pin

12:27.175 --> 12:29.476
that may have been put
into his ankle. I see.

12:29.510 --> 12:31.812
And I understand you have to comply

12:31.846 --> 12:33.146
with HIPAA regulations.

12:33.181 --> 12:36.316
So I brought this,
as well as the patient's mother.

12:37.919 --> 12:40.887
Yeah, um, can we discuss
this privately, please?

12:40.922 --> 12:42.055
Of course.

12:42.090 --> 12:43.624
Thank you.

12:43.658 --> 12:45.125
Please.

12:48.029 --> 12:49.997
Excuse me.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.734
Uh, Eva, can you pull up for me,

12:53.768 --> 12:56.236
uh, Pedro Mota's
medical chart, please?

12:56.271 --> 12:57.971
Thanks.

12:58.006 --> 12:59.640
You never reported Pedro's
knife wound to the police.

12:59.674 --> 13:02.509
This is a volunteer clinic
in a tough neighborhood.

13:02.543 --> 13:05.746
I-I-I call the police,
and my car won't be here when I leave.

13:05.780 --> 13:07.848
Doctor? Pedro Mota's file.

13:07.882 --> 13:08.915
Uh, thanks.

13:08.950 --> 13:09.983
Okay.

13:11.452 --> 13:13.520
"Mota, Pedro."

13:13.554 --> 13:14.755
Yeah. Yeah, he did.

13:14.789 --> 13:16.690
He had a nasty cut on the
right side of his torso,

13:16.724 --> 13:18.058
just above his liver.

13:18.092 --> 13:19.993
You said there was something
odd about the wound?

13:21.629 --> 13:24.298
You know, it looked
to me as if his mom

13:24.332 --> 13:26.300
might have had a go at him.

13:26.334 --> 13:28.435
An attempt at attitude adjustment?

13:28.469 --> 13:30.704
Did you ask him about that?

13:30.738 --> 13:32.773
No, I-I've learned... hi.

13:32.807 --> 13:34.341
I've learned not to
be overly curious

13:34.375 --> 13:35.876
with the teenagers here.

13:35.910 --> 13:37.944
They, um, they can
take it the wrong way.

13:37.979 --> 13:40.113
Right. It was a really
nasty cut, though.

13:40.148 --> 13:42.282
I made a follow-up for him,
um, but...

13:42.317 --> 13:44.284
He never came back? No.

13:44.319 --> 13:45.886
You know, and every time I called,

13:45.920 --> 13:47.454
his mom hung up on me.

13:47.488 --> 13:49.122
Chief?

13:49.157 --> 13:51.024
Mama's getting antsy out here.

13:51.059 --> 13:52.726
Oh. Uh, just one second.

13:52.760 --> 13:54.127
Um, you know,

13:54.162 --> 13:56.096
I...I really don't want the
mom to know that I've been...

13:56.130 --> 13:58.432
oh. Don't worry about her.
I'm not gonna tell her anything.

13:58.466 --> 14:00.901
Um, what about Pedro's ankle?

14:00.935 --> 14:02.135
Is there a pin in it?

14:02.170 --> 14:04.137
Right. Um...Yes.

14:04.172 --> 14:06.606
And it was put there by
our orthopedic surgeon...

14:06.641 --> 14:07.741
it was last year.

14:07.775 --> 14:09.476
Dr. Scott. Well, he's not in today.

14:09.510 --> 14:10.911
Do you want me to call him?

14:10.945 --> 14:14.147
Uh, no, I-if I could just
take the X-ray of the ankle,

14:14.182 --> 14:15.315
if you have that?

14:15.350 --> 14:17.317
Yeah. As well as Pedro's chart.

14:17.352 --> 14:20.220
I'm trying to identify his body.

14:20.254 --> 14:21.555
Um, yes.

14:21.589 --> 14:23.724
Here is the X-ray and, um,
the chart. Oh, thank you.

14:23.758 --> 14:25.826
I can also get you
Pedro's dental records.

14:25.860 --> 14:28.261
Wouldn't that be better in
terms of... uh, that's...

14:28.296 --> 14:29.629
Dental records won't
help in this instance.

14:29.664 --> 14:31.331
I mean, the whole face...
Uh, the chart will do!

14:31.366 --> 14:33.300
Thank you so much, doctor.

14:38.606 --> 14:40.440
Definitely a match.

14:40.475 --> 14:43.276
Did you happen to see a
scar on Pedro's torso,

14:43.311 --> 14:45.078
from a knife wound, maybe?

14:45.113 --> 14:46.313
Not on the left side.

14:46.347 --> 14:48.648
And the right side of
his abdomen was missing,

14:48.683 --> 14:50.684
along with a lot of other things.

14:50.718 --> 14:52.185
Like what?

14:52.220 --> 14:55.155
Your three victims also
had a few organs removed.

14:55.189 --> 14:57.491
Organs? What organs?

14:57.525 --> 14:59.192
When I started examining

14:59.227 --> 15:00.761
what was left of these
bodies last night,

15:00.795 --> 15:02.462
I noticed the first one
we identified here...

15:02.497 --> 15:05.165
Pedro... had a kidney
and a liver missing.

15:05.199 --> 15:06.933
Maybe also a heart...

15:06.968 --> 15:08.802
although I don't have
that part of his body.

15:08.836 --> 15:10.937
But his head and his
hands were also gone.

15:10.972 --> 15:12.672
So I didn't know if
that meant anything.

15:12.707 --> 15:16.643
Then this morning, I started
in on the second bag of bones.

15:16.677 --> 15:18.178
No organs.

15:18.212 --> 15:20.614
A-and the body from yesterday?

15:20.648 --> 15:24.017
Heart, liver, kidneys... all gone.

15:24.051 --> 15:25.218
Doctor, are you telling me

15:25.253 --> 15:27.621
you think these boys were
murdered for their organs?

15:27.655 --> 15:30.891
Officially, the cause of
death is still undetermined.

15:30.925 --> 15:34.628
But...I've -
I've looked very closely

15:34.662 --> 15:36.096
at all three bodies.

15:36.130 --> 15:37.497
And...

15:39.233 --> 15:42.035
...The piñatas are empty.

15:49.842 --> 15:52.043
Yes, sir?

15:52.078 --> 15:53.478
Where's Ruben?

15:54.102 --> 15:56.009
He's in the break room
watching television.

15:56.010 --> 15:57.776
He's not in the way.

15:57.811 --> 16:00.579
Any progress on finding his mother?

16:02.415 --> 16:04.850
Um, well, sir...

16:04.884 --> 16:06.452
Ruben says she's from Manzanillo.

16:06.486 --> 16:08.420
My uncle has a close friend there

16:08.455 --> 16:09.855
who did some digging around.

16:09.889 --> 16:12.558
No trace of a Maria Hernandez...Yet.

16:12.592 --> 16:15.094
But I'm trying new
searches every day.

16:15.128 --> 16:17.029
Huh.

16:17.063 --> 16:18.764
Well...

16:18.798 --> 16:22.501
Let's see what these, uh,
searches of yours have...

16:22.535 --> 16:24.770
Turned up.

16:32.312 --> 16:33.946
You dumped my computer, Tao?

16:35.115 --> 16:37.149
I'm trying to help you, Julio.

16:37.183 --> 16:40.486
You haven't been trying
to find Ruben's mother.

16:40.520 --> 16:42.688
You've been trying
to find babysitters

16:42.722 --> 16:45.491
and new day camps and
schools for the fall.

16:45.525 --> 16:49.628
There's not a single search
here for a Maria Hernandez.

16:49.662 --> 16:50.662
Not one.

16:50.697 --> 16:54.333
We dragged your office phone logs.

16:54.367 --> 16:56.635
You have not called Mexico once...

16:56.669 --> 16:58.804
In two weeks.

17:00.173 --> 17:02.141
Now you listen to me, Julio.

17:02.175 --> 17:04.476
Ruben deserves to
be with his mother,

17:04.511 --> 17:06.744
and his mother deserves
to be with him.

17:06.780 --> 17:08.347
She had four years to come back,

17:08.381 --> 17:10.015
and she hasn't done it.

17:10.049 --> 17:11.617
Julio, you don't even know her.

17:11.651 --> 17:13.318
She's not here, Tao!

17:13.353 --> 17:14.297
Hey, what else do I need to know?!

17:14.298 --> 17:15.186
She was deported by an ice agent

17:15.221 --> 17:17.356
who was a...A murdering rapist!

17:17.390 --> 17:19.324
She was probably too
afraid to come back!

17:19.358 --> 17:23.662
When you have a child,
you find a way!

17:28.935 --> 17:29.935
No.

17:31.838 --> 17:35.941
Ruben's better off
with me and my family.

17:35.975 --> 17:38.076
And I am not giving him back.

17:52.659 --> 17:54.760
All right, Tao.

17:54.794 --> 17:57.496
Manzanillo.

17:57.530 --> 17:59.097
Check it out with Ruben.

17:59.132 --> 18:01.633
If it's true, then we've
got a starting point,

18:01.668 --> 18:04.403
and it'll get easier from there.

18:04.437 --> 18:06.505
How do we get her
back into the country?

18:07.774 --> 18:10.576
Well, I've got that covered.

18:10.610 --> 18:13.078
What if Julio's right?

18:13.112 --> 18:15.914
I mean, how do we know
what's best for Ruben?

18:15.949 --> 18:18.650
We're following the law.

18:19.786 --> 18:22.221
That's how we know what's best.

18:36.536 --> 18:39.571
Chief, we got a DNA hit
on the second victim.

18:39.606 --> 18:41.206
Did you get a name?

18:41.241 --> 18:42.841
No, but I matched
some open case files.

18:42.876 --> 18:45.544
Dead guy number two
left a baseball cap

18:45.578 --> 18:46.945
at the scene of a
robbery last year.

18:46.980 --> 18:48.313
And then two months ago,

18:48.348 --> 18:50.382
he cut his arm on a glass door

18:50.416 --> 18:52.284
after killing a security guard.

18:52.318 --> 18:53.485
Okay, so our first bag of bones

18:53.520 --> 18:54.786
contains a child-molesting rapist,

18:54.821 --> 18:58.123
and the second one holds
a murdering armed robber.

18:58.157 --> 19:00.526
Sounds like someone is
doing the city a favor.

19:00.560 --> 19:02.961
With what Dr. Morales told us,
maybe it's a sign that gangs

19:02.996 --> 19:04.696
are getting into the
organ-selling business.

19:04.731 --> 19:06.565
Yeah, you know, chief,
I was doing some research.

19:06.599 --> 19:09.902
A kidney can go for over $10,000

19:09.936 --> 19:11.236
on the black market.

19:11.271 --> 19:12.671
A heart is off the charts.

19:12.705 --> 19:14.640
I mean, ounce for ounce,
it's better than dealing cocaine.

19:14.674 --> 19:17.442
What are you guys talking about?
These are gangsters.

19:17.477 --> 19:19.144
They're not interested in organs,

19:19.178 --> 19:21.113
and they're not doing brain
surgery on the side, either.

19:21.147 --> 19:22.714
It's only a theory, Julio!

19:22.749 --> 19:24.383
Well, your theory's stupid, Tao!

19:24.417 --> 19:26.385
Hey, that's lieutenant Tao!
You knock it off!

19:26.419 --> 19:28.720
And I mean it.
Okay, so, the autopsy results

19:28.755 --> 19:30.489
from the San Diego
and Phoenix bodies

19:30.523 --> 19:32.925
show the organs still in place.

19:32.959 --> 19:35.060
So, our murders aren't
connected to them.

19:35.094 --> 19:38.330
And I think Detective
Sanchez has a point.

19:38.364 --> 19:41.233
I seriously doubt that
local gang members

19:41.267 --> 19:42.334
have the resources or the knowledge

19:42.368 --> 19:44.436
to start trading kidneys and such

19:44.470 --> 19:45.837
on the black market.

19:45.872 --> 19:49.007
But who does? That is
the question. Who does?

19:49.042 --> 19:52.878
The organ distribution network
is pretty strictly regulated.

19:52.912 --> 19:55.113
Now, each state has a
federally designated

19:55.148 --> 19:57.282
organ procurement
organization, an O.P.O.

19:57.317 --> 19:59.184
Now, each time they harvest,

19:59.218 --> 20:01.253
they report to the united
network for organ sharing,

20:01.287 --> 20:03.655
who in turn tell them
where to send the hearts,

20:03.690 --> 20:04.823
the livers, and stuff.

20:04.857 --> 20:06.825
The whole system is
actually designed

20:06.859 --> 20:08.594
to keep track of
every single organ.

20:08.628 --> 20:09.928
Well, clearly...

20:12.966 --> 20:14.633
...It's not working
very well, is it?

20:19.105 --> 20:20.906
So, the O.P.O.
here in California...

20:20.940 --> 20:22.541
does it have a name?

20:22.575 --> 20:25.010
Life group alliance,
like all o.P.O.'S,

20:25.044 --> 20:26.712
is a non-profit organization.

20:26.746 --> 20:29.815
It's against the law for
anyone to sell us organs.

20:29.849 --> 20:31.183
Well, I appreciate

20:31.217 --> 20:32.851
that it's against the law,
Ms. Reid,

20:32.885 --> 20:34.886
but most killers don't
care about that.

20:34.921 --> 20:38.056
Besides which, you can't just
place any heart into any body.

20:38.091 --> 20:40.225
Donors have to be
matched with recipients.

20:40.259 --> 20:42.995
You people.

20:44.364 --> 20:46.231
You never do anything but
make things harder on us.

20:46.265 --> 20:48.367
Harder in what way?

20:48.401 --> 20:50.869
Let's start with a
potentially great source

20:50.903 --> 20:54.139
for healthy organs -
homicide victims.

20:54.173 --> 20:56.408
Well, a murder victim's organs

20:56.442 --> 20:58.176
might be used as evidence.

20:58.211 --> 21:00.579
And the guidelines under
which we operate...

21:00.613 --> 21:02.014
guidelines aren't laws.

21:02.048 --> 21:04.916
The police aren't compelled
to keep those organs.

21:04.951 --> 21:06.918
And patients die because
you don't give them to us.

21:06.953 --> 21:08.887
Ms. Reid, so far I've
got three victims

21:08.921 --> 21:10.255
who have been murdered

21:10.289 --> 21:12.057
and cut up for parts.

21:12.091 --> 21:13.659
And if this case requires it,

21:13.693 --> 21:15.694
trust me, I will hold back
every organ I can find,

21:15.728 --> 21:18.597
including those you're
supposed to be monitoring.

21:18.631 --> 21:20.499
Life group alliance
could not be involved.

21:20.533 --> 21:23.402
We have an elaborate set
of checks and balances

21:23.436 --> 21:25.437
to prevent undocumented organs
from entering our system.

21:25.471 --> 21:27.906
Wait. Wait. So are you
saying there is no way

21:27.940 --> 21:29.141
to get a transplant

21:29.175 --> 21:31.576
without waiting in
this line of yours?

21:31.611 --> 21:34.246
Well, it would have to
go through our database,

21:34.280 --> 21:36.248
but there are directed donations.

21:36.282 --> 21:39.951
People who want to donate
a kidney or bone marrow

21:39.986 --> 21:42.387
to specific patients.

21:42.422 --> 21:45.924
It's rarer, but there are
some angels among us.

21:45.958 --> 21:47.559
My victims didn't have wings.

21:47.593 --> 21:50.629
So this database of yours...

21:50.663 --> 21:51.963
it would include
everyone who's out there

21:51.998 --> 21:53.065
searching for an organ donor?

21:53.099 --> 21:54.399
Is that correct?

21:54.434 --> 21:55.967
I suppose you want to
see who's on that list.

21:56.002 --> 21:59.471
No, Ms. Reid.
I want to see who isn't.

21:59.505 --> 22:02.040
What are you doing?

22:02.075 --> 22:03.809
We're cross-referencing
a database of people

22:03.843 --> 22:07.145
who were looking for transplants
in southern California

22:07.180 --> 22:08.747
two months ago.

22:08.781 --> 22:10.248
And eliminating those
still waiting today.

22:10.283 --> 22:12.317
Why?

22:12.351 --> 22:14.486
Because kidneys, livers,
and especially hearts

22:14.520 --> 22:15.620
don't last very long.

22:15.655 --> 22:17.656
So whoever took those
organs from our victims

22:17.690 --> 22:19.324
had to transplant
them pretty quickly.

22:19.358 --> 22:21.593
And those people wouldn't
still be on the waiting list.

22:21.627 --> 22:23.729
All right. Here we go.

22:23.763 --> 22:25.130
Over the last two months,

22:25.164 --> 22:27.399
a total of 319 people
fell off the list.

22:27.433 --> 22:29.935
74 of them died before
getting a transplant,

22:29.969 --> 22:31.303
eliminating them.

22:31.337 --> 22:34.740
Okay, so that leaves 245
people in the L.A. area

22:34.774 --> 22:36.208
who received organs.

22:36.242 --> 22:38.243
38 of whom were recipients
of direct donors.

22:38.277 --> 22:39.978
Okay, so let's look 48 hours

22:40.012 --> 22:41.913
on either side of the day
that Pedro was found.

22:41.948 --> 22:44.683
We need to find someone who
matches him pretty closely.

22:44.717 --> 22:47.252
How about Oscar Garcia, age 16?

22:47.286 --> 22:48.987
Roughly the same age as Pedro Mota.

22:49.021 --> 22:51.189
Same ethnicity.

22:51.224 --> 22:52.290
Oscar got a kidney.

22:52.325 --> 22:53.825
Okay, uh, lieutenant Flynn,

22:53.860 --> 22:56.762
would you please bring Oscar
down here and a parent?

22:56.796 --> 22:58.864
So, if you've identified
your first victim,

22:58.898 --> 23:01.032
why haven't you
notified his mother yet?

23:01.067 --> 23:03.034
She waited over a month
to report him missing.

23:03.069 --> 23:04.636
She's in no rush to know anything.

23:04.670 --> 23:05.670
And what...

23:08.374 --> 23:09.674
What is the matter now?

23:09.709 --> 23:11.209
I asked you not to
sensationalize this case.

23:11.244 --> 23:13.211
Now you're making it look like
people are being hunted down

23:13.246 --> 23:14.646
in the streets of
L.A. for their organs.

23:14.680 --> 23:16.414
If this Oscar kid
has a stolen kidney,

23:16.449 --> 23:18.316
what are you gonna do -
ask for it back?

23:18.351 --> 23:20.886
Thank you for coming in,
Mr. Garcia.

23:20.920 --> 23:22.721
We are so low on funds right now

23:22.755 --> 23:24.356
that every tank of
gas really counts.

23:25.691 --> 23:28.593
W-what is it you think the
hospital might have done wrong?

23:28.628 --> 23:30.762
Well, um...

23:30.797 --> 23:32.697
Hopefully, nothing.

23:32.732 --> 23:33.865
After you, sir.

23:33.900 --> 23:35.100
Thank you.

23:37.403 --> 23:38.503
Deputy chief Johnson,

23:38.538 --> 23:40.272
this is Jorge and Oscar Garcia.

23:40.306 --> 23:41.422
Pleased to meet you. Good morning.

23:41.423 --> 23:42.474
Thank you so much for coming in.

23:42.508 --> 23:44.176
Pleasure. Thank you for coming.

23:44.210 --> 23:45.944
This is David Gabriel from
the state medical board.

23:45.978 --> 23:46.945
He's here to help us today.

23:46.979 --> 23:49.281
Hopefully,
this won't take too long.

23:49.315 --> 23:50.849
We just need to do a follow-up

23:50.883 --> 23:52.984
on transplants here in
southern California.

23:53.019 --> 23:54.152
I don't have to tell you

23:54.187 --> 23:56.021
how hard these organs
are to come by.

23:56.055 --> 23:57.689
And we've had a few complaints,

23:57.723 --> 23:59.224
so, better to be safe than sorry.

23:59.258 --> 24:02.127
Before we start, Oscar,
how are you feeling?

24:02.161 --> 24:03.128
You doing all right, buddy?

24:03.162 --> 24:04.462
I'm doing great.

24:04.497 --> 24:05.964
And I felt like that
right away, too.

24:05.998 --> 24:07.232
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

24:07.266 --> 24:09.034
He's... he's doing a lot better.

24:09.068 --> 24:10.335
Thank God.

24:10.369 --> 24:12.003
You'd never know how
bad he was before.

24:12.038 --> 24:13.238
No. I wouldn't.

24:13.272 --> 24:15.607
And you were very lucky
to find a direct donor.

24:15.641 --> 24:18.009
And just in the nick of time,
I understand, too.

24:18.044 --> 24:22.247
Now, the local registry lists
your donor's name as a...

24:22.281 --> 24:24.049
Sancho ruiz? Is that correct?

24:24.083 --> 24:26.117
Mm-hmm. Oscar's second cousin...

24:26.152 --> 24:28.353
on his mother's side of the family.

24:28.387 --> 24:31.022
Okay. And does... does Sancho
reside here in Los Angeles?

24:31.057 --> 24:32.290
No. No, no, no, no.

24:32.325 --> 24:33.992
He... he lives in Mexico.

24:34.026 --> 24:36.094
We'd never even heard of Sancho.

24:36.128 --> 24:37.596
Can you believe that?

24:37.630 --> 24:38.730
But when we found him,

24:38.764 --> 24:40.465
and it turned out he
was a match for me,

24:40.499 --> 24:42.434
Sancho said he'd
be honored to help.

24:42.468 --> 24:44.669
Isn't that wonderful?

24:44.704 --> 24:47.572
Doing my job, I don't meet a
lot of people like Sancho.

24:47.607 --> 24:48.707
I can tell you that.

24:48.741 --> 24:50.876
How on earth did y'all find him

24:50.910 --> 24:53.845
if no one had ever
heard of him before?

24:53.880 --> 24:55.113
Ancestry.com.

24:55.147 --> 24:57.949
See, a lot of our extended family

24:57.984 --> 24:59.184
still lives in Mexico.

24:59.218 --> 25:00.952
Hmm.

25:00.987 --> 25:02.254
And you contacted Sancho how?

25:04.790 --> 25:08.360
For example, did you speak
with Sancho on the phone?

25:08.394 --> 25:10.528
No. I didn't even know about him

25:10.563 --> 25:12.430
until we were headed for surgery.

25:12.465 --> 25:14.199
Dad didn't want to get my hopes up.

25:14.233 --> 25:15.734
After we were through it all,

25:15.768 --> 25:17.102
I wrote him a letter thanking him.

25:17.136 --> 25:18.203
Didn't I, dad?

25:19.405 --> 25:20.605
Really?

25:20.640 --> 25:22.607
Where'd you send it?
The letter, I mean.

25:22.642 --> 25:24.409
I mean, what's Sancho's address?

25:24.443 --> 25:26.444
We would all really
love to talk with him.

25:28.447 --> 25:29.648
No.

25:29.682 --> 25:30.949
Mr. Garcia...

25:32.551 --> 25:35.353
...I need you to give me
Sancho's contact information.

25:36.455 --> 25:40.091
These are not follow-up
questions to Oscar's surgery.

25:42.929 --> 25:45.196
I mean, what...
what the hell is going on here?

25:45.231 --> 25:46.898
Mr. Garcia,
why don't we start over?

25:46.933 --> 25:49.868
Only this time, I need to
advise you of your rights.

25:49.902 --> 25:52.203
You know what? Don't bother.

25:52.238 --> 25:54.906
'Cause I am not answering
any more questions

25:54.941 --> 25:57.008
until I speak to an attorney. Okay?

26:03.289 --> 26:05.519
**

26:06.098 --> 26:06.485
Great.

26:06.486 --> 26:08.787
So Mr. Garcia's lawyer already
contacted the hospital

26:08.821 --> 26:10.322
where Oscar got his
organ transplant.

26:10.356 --> 26:11.823
He threatened him with legal action

26:11.858 --> 26:13.959
if they divulge any of the
boy's medical history to us.

26:15.154 --> 26:16.621
How about the heads? Sst!

26:16.656 --> 26:18.323
Have you found any
of the heads yet?

26:19.559 --> 26:21.259
I think it would be interesting.

26:23.930 --> 26:25.197
It would, wouldn't it?

26:26.399 --> 26:27.766
Detective Sanchez,

26:27.800 --> 26:31.469
what about Oscar's
so-called cousin, Sancho?

26:31.504 --> 26:32.771
He doesn't exist, period, chief.

26:34.173 --> 26:37.142
Ruben, you don't need to
be hearing any of this.

26:37.176 --> 26:39.945
Go watch television
with Buzz. Buzz!

26:46.452 --> 26:49.054
Oh...

26:49.088 --> 26:55.026
I'd give one of my kidneys
to Julio if he needed it.

26:56.329 --> 26:59.764
But Ruben couldn't just
give Julio a kidney.

26:59.799 --> 27:02.734
There would have to be
some kind of an exam

27:02.768 --> 27:05.837
to make sure that they were
a good match for each other.

27:05.871 --> 27:07.172
Wouldn't they?

27:07.206 --> 27:10.008
Uh, where's Pedro Mota's
chart from that clinic?

27:10.042 --> 27:11.042
Oh, I have it, chief!

27:11.077 --> 27:12.244
Is there any kind of test in there

27:12.278 --> 27:14.045
that doesn't go with a knife wound

27:14.080 --> 27:15.347
or a broken ankle?

27:15.381 --> 27:16.848
Well, let's see.
Right after the surgery,

27:16.882 --> 27:18.516
where the doctor put
a pin in his ankle,

27:18.551 --> 27:20.752
there's a... Wow...

27:20.786 --> 27:22.754
A CT angiogram scan?

27:22.788 --> 27:24.823
Now, what would that
have to do with...

27:24.857 --> 27:26.358
Ooh.

27:26.392 --> 27:30.595
Luminex flow bead
DSA determinations.

27:30.630 --> 27:32.063
English, Tao. English.

27:32.098 --> 27:34.266
These are medical assessments

27:34.300 --> 27:36.234
used to determine the
size and viability

27:36.269 --> 27:37.769
of organs for transplant,

27:37.803 --> 27:42.040
ordered by a Dr. Navarro.

27:42.074 --> 27:44.309
Dr. Navarro? But he only
volunteers at the clinic.

27:44.343 --> 27:46.044
What's his day job?

27:46.078 --> 27:47.646
Uh...

27:47.680 --> 27:50.181
Dr. Luis Navarro -
surgery and transplant medicine.

27:50.216 --> 27:52.817
Admitting privileges,
St. Sebastian Hospital.

28:16.042 --> 28:17.709
Mr. and Mrs. Witten?

28:20.713 --> 28:23.381
All right.

28:23.416 --> 28:24.716
It's gonna be okay. All right?

28:24.750 --> 28:25.984
Everything's gonna be okay.

28:41.767 --> 28:43.768
Ophthalmology,

28:43.803 --> 28:45.170
please call optics lab.

28:45.204 --> 28:47.339
Ophthalmology,
please call the optics lab.

28:51.477 --> 28:54.379
Excuse me.

28:54.413 --> 28:55.714
A-are you waiting for Dr. Navarro?

28:55.748 --> 28:57.248
Yes. Yes. I am. Is he here?

28:57.283 --> 28:58.383
Uh, not yet,

28:58.417 --> 28:59.651
but we expect him any minute.

28:59.685 --> 29:01.353
I've just got a few
more questions for you.

29:01.387 --> 29:02.620
Oh, my God. You're kidding me.

29:02.655 --> 29:03.688
They're very basic.

29:03.723 --> 29:05.223
Uh, your daughter's name,

29:05.257 --> 29:06.491
the organ she's receiving,

29:06.525 --> 29:08.093
and how long she's been -
Mary Witten,

29:08.127 --> 29:09.461
a heart,

29:09.495 --> 29:10.695
and she's been waiting for months.

29:10.730 --> 29:12.564
Months.

29:12.598 --> 29:14.833
I mean, in fact,
we'd almost given up.

29:14.867 --> 29:17.469
And then Dr. Navarro
calls us this afternoon,

29:17.503 --> 29:18.536
out of the blue,

29:18.571 --> 29:20.638
and tells us to get ready.

29:20.673 --> 29:22.807
I...

29:22.842 --> 29:26.111
I hate to think about
what some other family

29:26.145 --> 29:28.079
is going through right now,
but for us...

29:28.114 --> 29:29.280
for us, it's a miracle.

29:29.315 --> 29:31.282
If that heart can just get here.

29:31.317 --> 29:32.984
Chief. Dr. Navarro's still not...

29:33.018 --> 29:34.619
Yes, David. I know.

29:34.653 --> 29:36.221
"Chief"? Who are you?

29:36.255 --> 29:38.656
When did Dr. Navarro
tell you about the heart?

29:38.691 --> 29:41.292
A couple of hours ago.
Why? What's wrong?

29:41.327 --> 29:44.028
Uh...

29:44.063 --> 29:45.830
Excuse me. I'm... I'm sorry.

29:45.865 --> 29:46.887
Excuse me, sir. No, you can't do

29:46.888 --> 29:48.166
anything to interfere
with this surgery!

29:48.200 --> 29:50.201
Please, sir! This is my
daughter's only chance!

29:50.236 --> 29:51.603
Keep walking. What is it?!

29:51.637 --> 29:52.804
Why do you want to
talk to Dr. Navarro?!

29:52.838 --> 29:54.139
Please, tell me! I'm begging you!

29:54.173 --> 29:56.141
Please don't do
anything to hurt Mary!

29:56.175 --> 29:58.276
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

30:50.429 --> 30:52.230
Dr. Navarro, put your hands up,

30:52.264 --> 30:54.199
and step away from that table!

30:54.233 --> 30:56.301
Sorry, I can't do that.

30:56.335 --> 30:57.569
This is a sterile environment.

30:57.603 --> 30:59.637
Opening that door could
compromise my procedure.

30:59.672 --> 31:01.139
That's the point, doctor.

31:01.173 --> 31:02.907
Put your hands in the air and
move away from the table,

31:02.942 --> 31:04.175
or I'm going to shoot you!

31:04.210 --> 31:05.710
Well, aim for my head, would you?

31:05.744 --> 31:07.378
I'm an organ donor.

31:09.248 --> 31:10.682
Look. This boy is gone.

31:10.716 --> 31:13.084
His brain, such as it was, is dead.

31:13.118 --> 31:15.353
And his heart...

31:16.622 --> 31:18.590
...Has stopped.

31:18.624 --> 31:21.392
I've already removed
his kidneys and liver,

31:21.427 --> 31:23.061
so the boy's prognosis is terminal.

31:23.095 --> 31:25.430
Please don't try and
come in through...

31:25.464 --> 31:26.598
Oh, that's plexiglas.

31:26.632 --> 31:28.066
If you're gonna start shooting,

31:28.100 --> 31:30.435
try not to hurt yourselves.
Look. The boy is dead.

31:30.469 --> 31:32.437
And there's a numeric
code on that door.

31:32.471 --> 31:33.471
So good luck with that.

31:33.506 --> 31:35.440
Detective Gabriel,
stand on that chair,

31:35.474 --> 31:37.108
and check out the body.

31:37.142 --> 31:40.278
A young girl's life depends
on what we do here tonight.

31:40.312 --> 31:42.247
You mean Mary Witten?

31:42.281 --> 31:44.249
If these men manage to break
in here before I'm finished,

31:44.283 --> 31:45.283
she dies.

31:45.317 --> 31:46.384
Chief.

31:46.418 --> 31:47.785
That heart's not beating.

31:47.820 --> 31:49.020
He's... the kid's dead, chief.
He's dead.

31:49.054 --> 31:50.788
Get out your cellphones, gentlemen.

31:50.823 --> 31:52.790
I want video of this.

31:52.825 --> 31:54.626
You're in a world
of trouble, doctor!

31:54.660 --> 31:57.028
Really? What kind of trouble
are we talking about?

31:57.062 --> 31:58.730
In addition to killing Pedro Mota

31:58.764 --> 31:59.831
and removing his organs, we just

31:59.832 --> 32:00.965
watched you murder this young man.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.101
Are you sure you have a
proper cause of death?

32:03.135 --> 32:04.969
Because from where I'm standing,

32:05.004 --> 32:06.471
it looks like this boy
died of a brain hemorrhage.

32:06.505 --> 32:07.772
That's all your medical
examiner is gonna find.

32:07.806 --> 32:08.773
I promise you.

32:08.807 --> 32:10.074
All right, then, doctor.

32:10.109 --> 32:12.810
You want to stall me?
I can stall, too.

32:12.845 --> 32:15.113
How long is that heart you've
been working on good for?

32:15.147 --> 32:16.981
Three hours? Four?

32:17.016 --> 32:18.483
We'll just wait here

32:18.517 --> 32:19.551
until you decide to
be more forthcoming.

32:19.585 --> 32:20.952
And remember,

32:20.986 --> 32:23.688
a young girl's life depends
on what we do here tonight.

32:24.924 --> 32:26.424
Chief, chief. Look.

32:26.458 --> 32:28.660
This decision is way
above my pay grade,

32:28.694 --> 32:30.128
but those organs are evidence.

32:30.162 --> 32:31.763
Let me handle this my way.

32:31.797 --> 32:33.765
You want Mary Witten
to get that heart,

32:33.799 --> 32:35.400
you better answer my questions.

32:35.434 --> 32:37.835
I want a list of all the
people that you've killed

32:37.870 --> 32:39.521
and all of the people
who are helping

32:39.522 --> 32:40.772
you distribute these organs.

32:40.806 --> 32:42.073
Well, you are asking
for the wrong lists.

32:42.107 --> 32:43.608
What about the list
of all the victims

32:43.642 --> 32:45.510
these young men left behind them?

32:45.544 --> 32:47.445
Detective Gabriel,
call for back-up.

32:47.479 --> 32:49.347
I want this door knocked down now!

32:49.381 --> 32:51.416
Wait! Please.

32:53.953 --> 32:55.186
I'll talk to you.

32:55.220 --> 32:57.522
Just promise me that Mary Witten
will get her heart.

32:57.556 --> 33:00.024
All right. You answer
my questions truthfully,

33:00.059 --> 33:01.659
and I'll see what I can
do about your patients.

33:01.694 --> 33:04.729
How many people have you
operated on like this?

33:08.567 --> 33:10.568
Miguel here makes five.

33:11.570 --> 33:14.038
Now, the first one was a
homicide victim from six points.

33:14.073 --> 33:15.773
I couldn't save him.

33:15.808 --> 33:18.543
But he looked like he might be
a match for a patient of mine,

33:18.577 --> 33:20.311
so I kept him alive long
enough to make sure.

33:20.346 --> 33:24.182
And then I took his liver
to save another's life.

33:24.216 --> 33:26.184
And I found myself inspired.

33:26.218 --> 33:27.619
Now, I really don't expect you

33:27.653 --> 33:29.887
to appreciate the difficulty
of what I'm doing here,

33:29.922 --> 33:32.457
but there are not that many doctors
who could single-handedly...

33:32.491 --> 33:33.825
how'd you get around
the double-blind system

33:33.859 --> 33:34.993
to direct this heart
to Mary Witten?

33:35.027 --> 33:37.395
Well, that was forgery, and friends

33:37.429 --> 33:38.830
from the 11 transplant hospitals

33:38.864 --> 33:41.399
all over southern
California who are exhausted

33:41.433 --> 33:43.935
from watching decent
people die every day...

33:43.969 --> 33:45.670
I need names, doctor, not a sermon!

33:45.704 --> 33:46.938
Everyone helping me thinks
I'm giving them organs

33:46.972 --> 33:48.039
from homicide victims.

33:48.073 --> 33:49.040
Doctor, you are!

33:49.074 --> 33:50.642
You are still stalling, doctor.

33:50.676 --> 33:52.110
I can play this game all night!

33:52.144 --> 33:53.711
How long can Mary Witten play it?

33:56.115 --> 33:58.049
On my laptop behind you,

33:58.083 --> 34:00.184
there's a file with every
name that you want,

34:00.219 --> 34:01.886
including the precise measurements

34:01.920 --> 34:05.223
of all my potential
recipients and their donors.

34:05.257 --> 34:08.159
Other donors? You're planning
to do this to other people?!

34:08.193 --> 34:11.429
Two more. Yes.

34:21.005 --> 34:24.475
So you started out using
someone else's murder victim,

34:24.510 --> 34:27.210
but that's not how Pedro
Mota came to be here.

34:27.246 --> 34:30.114
Pedro Mota had a knife wound,
like you were told.

34:30.149 --> 34:31.882
But he had been here before

34:31.917 --> 34:33.751
after breaking his ankle.

34:33.786 --> 34:34.952
Yes.

34:37.922 --> 34:39.857
Pedro Mota...

34:41.493 --> 34:44.829
...Led the gang rape
of a 12-year-old girl.

34:44.862 --> 34:48.232
Her mother came home from
work to find in her backyard

34:48.266 --> 34:51.335
six teenage boys taking
turns on her only child.

34:51.370 --> 34:53.036
But while she was calling 911,

34:53.072 --> 34:55.572
she noticed one of
them hurt himself,

34:55.607 --> 34:56.708
limping away.

34:56.742 --> 34:59.711
So, while I was treating
her daughter for...

34:59.745 --> 35:02.647
For unspeakable things,

35:02.681 --> 35:04.982
who should walk into our
clinic with a broken ankle?

35:05.017 --> 35:06.284
Pedro Mota.

35:07.252 --> 35:10.722
You know, with the
proper anesthetic,

35:10.756 --> 35:13.024
I made Pedro extremely talkative.

35:13.058 --> 35:14.726
So, before he was transformed

35:14.760 --> 35:16.527
into a useful member of society,

35:16.562 --> 35:19.363
he gave me the names of all
his little rapist friends.

35:20.699 --> 35:21.632
And this ax?

35:23.202 --> 35:26.104
It was necessary to the...

35:26.138 --> 35:27.572
To the post-op procedure

35:27.606 --> 35:29.207
I used to make these boys
look like cartel victims.

35:29.241 --> 35:30.541
My hope was to misdirect you.

35:30.576 --> 35:32.677
Once I knew you had Pedro's chart,

35:32.711 --> 35:35.613
I knew I was running out of time.

35:39.718 --> 35:40.952
I'm still running out of time.

35:40.986 --> 35:42.086
And this victim...

35:42.121 --> 35:43.354
He... he was also part
of that gang rape?

35:43.388 --> 35:44.255
"Victim"?

35:45.390 --> 35:46.958
All right.

35:46.992 --> 35:49.727
Yes. He was.

35:49.762 --> 35:51.095
I called Miguel

35:51.130 --> 35:53.898
to tell him that he might
have been exposed to an STD.

35:53.932 --> 35:56.868
And while he was here complaining
about the neighborhood whores,

35:56.902 --> 35:58.569
I stuck a needle in his arm.

35:58.604 --> 36:01.139
Now, I really shouldn't
have to explain

36:01.173 --> 36:03.407
to law-enforcement
professionals how that works.

36:03.442 --> 36:04.475
I don't understand.

36:04.510 --> 36:05.910
Why didn't you just
call the police?!

36:05.944 --> 36:09.147
You don't understand because
you didn't struggle...

36:10.582 --> 36:12.316
...To save a little girl's life!

36:12.351 --> 36:14.218
Watch her head swell
to twice its size!

36:14.253 --> 36:17.088
She can't even identify
her own mother anymore,

36:17.122 --> 36:20.258
let alone the six teenage...
Animals who mutilated her!

36:23.195 --> 36:25.096
You know, there was no DNA on her.

36:25.130 --> 36:27.832
And I checked everywhere.

36:27.866 --> 36:29.433
There wasn't any. "Call the poli... "

36:29.468 --> 36:31.269
What were you gonna do?!

36:31.303 --> 36:32.937
You're not in charge out here!

36:32.971 --> 36:35.473
Where's the line for you, doctor?

36:35.507 --> 36:37.842
You start by cutting up people

36:37.876 --> 36:39.677
you think committed rape,
and who's next?

36:39.711 --> 36:41.112
Drug dealers?

36:41.146 --> 36:42.480
Thieves?

36:42.514 --> 36:43.948
People who cross against the light?

36:43.982 --> 36:45.883
Listen to me.

36:45.918 --> 36:47.585
There are two really
bad boys out there

36:47.619 --> 36:48.619
that I didn't get to.

36:48.654 --> 36:50.621
Why don't you give me a year?

36:50.656 --> 36:52.023
See what happens.

36:52.057 --> 36:55.259
I can make this place
safer than you can.

36:57.729 --> 36:59.564
Who gave you the right to play God?

37:03.569 --> 37:05.770
The position was vacant.

37:05.804 --> 37:08.172
So I took it.

37:14.313 --> 37:16.948
Now...

37:16.982 --> 37:18.549
I've done my end of the bargain.

37:18.584 --> 37:21.619
I've...Fully confessed.

37:29.194 --> 37:31.495
Will Mary Witten get her heart?

37:31.530 --> 37:34.098
Or will you keep it... as evidence?

37:42.040 --> 37:44.508
Well, well.

37:44.543 --> 37:46.043
Look who's playing God now.

37:48.172 --> 37:50.268
**

37:50.269 --> 37:52.720
But I'm not sure the
D.A. will press charges

37:52.721 --> 37:53.855
against anyone except him.

37:53.889 --> 37:55.547
That's not our decision to make.

37:55.548 --> 37:57.148
We made lots of decisions
that weren't ours to make.

37:57.183 --> 37:58.983
So you would have
brought the heart in

37:59.018 --> 38:00.351
and booked it as evidence?

38:00.386 --> 38:02.787
At least we know where it is.

38:02.822 --> 38:04.689
Uh, yes, Fritzi.

38:04.723 --> 38:05.690
Where are you?

38:05.724 --> 38:06.858
Uh, still at the hospital,

38:06.892 --> 38:08.960
waiting to see if the heart takes.

38:08.994 --> 38:11.095
Where are you?
Walking towards your office.

38:11.130 --> 38:13.364
I have Ruben's mother with me.

38:13.399 --> 38:16.768
Well, it had to be done.

38:16.802 --> 38:21.039
Just, uh, watch out for
Julio for me, would you?

38:21.073 --> 38:22.474
Let me know how it goes.

38:22.508 --> 38:23.775
I will.

38:23.809 --> 38:26.010
Okay.

38:32.585 --> 38:34.185
Oh.

38:45.764 --> 38:46.931
I'm telling you, Julio.

38:46.966 --> 38:49.167
You can't just pick it
up and expect to win.

38:49.201 --> 38:50.568
If you want to master this game,

38:50.603 --> 38:53.638
you gotta practice,
or I'll beat you every time.

38:53.672 --> 38:56.174
Ruben!

38:56.208 --> 38:58.309
Mama! Mama!

39:12.224 --> 39:13.758
Ah.

39:13.792 --> 39:15.260
Julio...

39:15.294 --> 39:17.695
Meet Maria Hernandez.

39:17.730 --> 39:20.732
Tao tracked her
down outside Loreto.

39:20.766 --> 39:22.433
Agent Howard arranged
to have her flown up.

39:28.641 --> 39:32.610
This is a good thing, Julio.

39:38.083 --> 39:39.551
Gracias.

39:42.121 --> 39:44.923
Thank you. Gracias.

39:53.465 --> 39:55.600
Thank you, Julio.

39:55.634 --> 39:57.302
Thank you for finding my mother.

39:59.038 --> 40:00.038
Sure.

40:02.575 --> 40:04.876
Sure.

40:04.910 --> 40:07.111
You be good to her, okay?

40:07.146 --> 40:09.614
That's your mom.

40:21.293 --> 40:23.761
Go on.

40:27.433 --> 40:29.634
Mmm.

41:00.966 --> 41:03.167
Julio, I thought you left.

41:03.202 --> 41:06.070
Perdone, señora.

41:06.105 --> 41:07.639
¿Está usted casada?

41:08.941 --> 41:11.676
No. No estoy.

41:11.710 --> 41:13.044
Um, I'm not married.

41:14.613 --> 41:16.514
Do you have a boyfriend?

41:21.253 --> 41:22.387
No.

41:22.421 --> 41:23.821
Well, then, um,

41:23.856 --> 41:25.790
how would you and Ruben
like to have dinner with me?

41:28.027 --> 41:29.460
I'm sure Agent Howard
has other plans.

41:29.495 --> 41:31.729
Uh...

41:31.764 --> 41:33.264
I do.

41:36.635 --> 41:38.436
Thank you.

41:39.972 --> 41:42.306
You're gonna like Julio, mom.

41:42.341 --> 41:44.308
He took me to the
firing range with him,

41:44.343 --> 41:47.111
and he shot a bull's-eye from
over a thousand feet away,

41:47.146 --> 41:49.714
like, bam!
