WEBVTT

02:21.350 --> 02:22.977
A stone statue?!

02:23.185 --> 02:24.436
He switched places!

02:32.528 --> 02:34.405
You were careless, Kinshiki.

02:39.994 --> 02:41.787
Rinnegan, eh...

03:00.264 --> 03:02.933
Naruto Uzumaki is my dad.

03:04.226 --> 03:05.936
My dad's not like everyone else.

03:06.478 --> 03:08.981
He's the busiest shinobi
in the village.

03:08.981 --> 03:11.817
In other words,
he's the Seventh Hokage.

03:11.817 --> 03:20.618
SEVENTH HOKAGE

03:34.381 --> 03:35.799
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

03:42.765 --> 03:44.725
You really trashed everything here.

03:47.311 --> 03:50.648
I'm your opponent,
you damn panda!

03:54.360 --> 03:56.237
Huh? That's a bear.

03:56.278 --> 03:58.656
It's a bear that looks like
a vicious panda!

03:59.156 --> 04:02.785
Piece of cake.
It's just an ugly panda!

04:02.785 --> 04:05.246
I said it's a bear,
Boruto, you idiot!

04:05.287 --> 04:07.206
Does that really matter?

04:07.790 --> 04:09.750
What's important now...

04:09.792 --> 04:12.753
is to lure this bear-panda
toward Konohamaru Sensei.

04:25.474 --> 04:26.850
Cha-?!

04:37.486 --> 04:40.197
See? That panda was
a piece of cake!

04:41.782 --> 04:45.786
Leave it to the son of the Seventh
and grandson of the Fourth...

04:46.620 --> 04:48.539
He'll probably become
a Hokage too, huh?

04:51.417 --> 04:53.377
I'm going to be the Hokage!

05:02.928 --> 05:04.638
Shadow Paralysis Jutsu!

05:16.483 --> 05:18.402
The recovery team
will be here soon.

05:18.944 --> 05:21.488
Thank you so much.

05:22.156 --> 05:24.241
Umm... Konohamaru Sensei...

05:25.034 --> 05:26.660
That jutsu you used earlier...

05:26.702 --> 05:29.830
Wasn't it a Secret Jutsu
of the Nara Clan?

05:29.997 --> 05:30.873
Yeah...

05:35.878 --> 05:37.796
Wow, cool!

05:38.005 --> 05:40.591
Is that the new Ninja Tool
I've heard rumors about?

05:40.883 --> 05:42.634
News reaches you fast, Mitsuki.

05:43.093 --> 05:45.179
It's a prototype from
the Scientific Ninja Tool Team.

05:45.721 --> 05:49.475
Getting data from this
was also part of the mission.

05:50.059 --> 05:52.561
It's an extremely small scroll.

05:53.062 --> 05:55.439
This contains that jutsu?

05:55.939 --> 05:58.609
This thing can seal ninjutsu.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.862
Shikamaru's Shadow Paralysis Jutsu
was sealed in this.

06:04.365 --> 06:06.658
This is my Rasengan...

06:14.958 --> 06:16.377
I can...

06:16.585 --> 06:18.087
release it like this!

06:24.301 --> 06:25.636
Wow!

06:25.636 --> 06:28.138
That's awesome.
Can anyone use it?

06:28.514 --> 06:29.473
Yeah...

06:29.848 --> 06:32.684
Chakra has nothing to do with it.
I would even go so far as saying

06:32.726 --> 06:33.977
it doesn't take a ninja
to use it either-

06:35.562 --> 06:36.980
Konohamaru Sensei...

06:37.773 --> 06:40.275
Since one's own chakra isn't involved,

06:40.275 --> 06:43.654
the aim could go a little off
which could pose a problem...

06:51.787 --> 06:52.996
<i>The most important thing is</i>

06:53.038 --> 06:55.124
<i>to communicate properly,
you know?</i>

06:55.499 --> 06:56.542
<i>You're right.</i>

06:57.251 --> 07:00.170
<i>As the Seventh Hokage,
Naruto just said...</i>

07:00.170 --> 07:03.507
<i>That's how our current peace
was established</i>

07:03.549 --> 07:05.551
<i>after the many wars of the past.</i>

07:05.592 --> 07:08.512
<i>But we must never forget that
this peace was made possible</i>

07:08.512 --> 07:12.933
<i>through the sacrifices of
many shinobi.</i>

07:13.183 --> 07:14.351
<i>That's right, you know.</i>

07:14.893 --> 07:17.354
<i>So to ensure that these
fallen shinobi of past wars</i>

07:17.354 --> 07:21.817
<i>did not die in vain,
and to preserve this peace,</i>

07:21.817 --> 07:23.360
SOLD OUT

07:23.360 --> 07:27.030
<i>we must teach the youth,
the next generation, about this.</i>

07:27.322 --> 07:28.532
<i>That's right, you know.</i>

07:29.158 --> 07:32.453
<i>We can't say that the scars left
by this great war</i>

07:32.494 --> 07:34.955
<i>that embroiled five villages
have completely healed.</i>

07:34.997 --> 07:38.250
<i>Through the efforts of
the Seventh Hokage,</i>

07:38.292 --> 07:41.211
<i>the five villages which were once
at odds have become one...</i>

07:41.211 --> 07:44.715
<i>and step by step, they are making
inroads toward progress.</i>

07:45.466 --> 07:46.717
<i>You've got that right, you know.</i>

07:47.134 --> 07:50.471
<i>We are an advanced society of
information and communication,</i>

07:50.512 --> 07:54.057
<i>and we must continue to guard the peace
and prosperity that we have secured.</i>

07:54.725 --> 07:57.895
<i>Now, about the Chunin Exams
which, for the first time,</i>

07:57.936 --> 08:01.899
<i>the five villages have agreed
to sponsor together...</i>

08:02.357 --> 08:05.861
<i>Do you have any words for
the genin who will be taking part?</i>

08:07.029 --> 08:09.072
<i>Just remember these three things!</i>

08:09.072 --> 08:10.991
<i>Teamwork. . .and perseverance...</i>

08:13.035 --> 08:14.077
<i>That's all.</i>

08:14.077 --> 08:15.871
<i>Good luck to everyone!</i>

08:17.581 --> 08:19.082
<i>That was just two...</i>

08:19.833 --> 08:22.336
<i>Anyway, thank you for
those inspiring words.</i>

08:22.878 --> 08:25.589
<i>We've been bringing this
to you live today.</i>

08:29.009 --> 08:32.011
Hey, Dad, I'm not talking
to a Shadow Clone, am I?

08:32.554 --> 08:35.432
Of course not.
This is the Hokage's office.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.267
And by the way...

08:37.308 --> 08:40.395
Don't call me "Dad" in here.
It's Lord Hokage or Lord Seventh.

08:41.522 --> 08:42.940
So? How'd it go?

08:43.649 --> 08:49.488
Well, it was an easy mission.
I could've done all by myself.

08:50.280 --> 08:53.867
What's important for a shinobi
is teamwork and perseverance.

08:54.409 --> 08:55.953
You must train as a trio-

08:55.994 --> 09:01.124
I didn't even have to train to make
three Shadow Clones of myself.

09:01.416 --> 09:04.670
I know Wind Style, Lightning Style,
and recently, even Water Style...

09:04.753 --> 09:05.671
Konohamaru!

09:05.921 --> 09:08.048
What have you been teaching him?!

09:10.592 --> 09:12.719
Just because you don't know
anything about me,

09:12.761 --> 09:14.096
don't blame my teacher!

09:14.471 --> 09:16.306
You've never even
bothered to watch me!

09:22.938 --> 09:24.064
Forget it.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.066
What's important is-

09:26.108 --> 09:27.192
Never mind that.

09:27.234 --> 09:31.029
You know what important day
this is, don't you?

09:32.656 --> 09:36.326
If you forget my kid sister's birthday,
I'll never forgive you.

09:47.129 --> 09:48.255
Excuse me...

09:49.923 --> 09:51.008
Oh, Katasuke...

09:51.633 --> 09:53.927
As the head of the Scientific
Ninja Tools Team,

09:53.969 --> 09:56.805
I have a request, Lord Seventh.

09:56.888 --> 09:57.681
What is it?

09:57.764 --> 09:59.683
For the upcoming Chunin Exams,

09:59.725 --> 10:01.852
we would like
your authorization to use

10:01.893 --> 10:04.187
the scientific tools developed
by our team!

10:05.188 --> 10:07.858
Then the genin won't have
to go through harsh training...

10:07.899 --> 10:10.402
and they can widen the scope
of their individual ninjutsu!

10:10.611 --> 10:13.530
Their performance will
also be more elaborate.

10:14.156 --> 10:16.283
And if we market them
to other villages,

10:16.325 --> 10:19.328
the outside income will benefit
the Hidden Leaf Village.

10:19.328 --> 10:20.162
No!

10:21.455 --> 10:23.957
The Chunin Exam is not
a performance.

10:24.333 --> 10:26.168
Its purpose is to nurture shinobi.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.379
I see...

10:30.339 --> 10:31.423
I'm sorry I bothered you.

10:46.021 --> 10:49.066
This isn't the lame era
you grew up in, Dad.

10:49.441 --> 10:51.735
Hey, Boruto! Wait!

10:53.362 --> 10:56.823
I was about to give him the application
for the Chunin Exams!

10:58.700 --> 10:59.743
Here you go.

11:00.369 --> 11:01.745
Thanks again!

11:02.454 --> 11:04.873
Don't forget the new software too.

11:05.248 --> 11:06.917
You know I won't...

11:07.542 --> 11:09.586
By the way, Young Lord, are you
taking part in the Chunin Exams?

11:09.586 --> 11:10.337
Nope.

11:11.380 --> 11:13.757
That's a shame...

11:13.840 --> 11:17.010
I'm sure everyone wants
to see your skills.

11:17.427 --> 11:19.596
Especially your father.

11:21.348 --> 11:24.226
The Hokage is in the audience
during the Chunin Exams?

11:24.267 --> 11:25.477
Of course.

11:29.690 --> 11:32.109
BORUTO LEVEL MAX

11:33.777 --> 11:35.779
So you're also a whiz
at video games.

11:36.738 --> 11:38.365
CHUNIN

11:39.241 --> 11:40.450
What do you want, Mitsuki?

11:41.076 --> 11:42.828
I already said I'm not interested.

11:42.869 --> 11:45.372
Konohamaru Sensei
asked us to come.

11:45.622 --> 11:47.290
We need a three-man team

11:47.332 --> 11:49.084
to qualify for the Chunin
Selection Exams.

11:49.459 --> 11:51.420
If you don't apply,
we can't take part.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.296
I don't care.

11:54.131 --> 11:56.341
My dream is to become
the Hokage.

11:56.550 --> 11:58.427
Are you going to destroy
my dream?!

11:59.094 --> 12:00.637
<i>I...</i>

12:00.929 --> 12:02.431
...don't wanna be the Hokage!

12:05.600 --> 12:07.644
The Hokage's position
isn't hereditary!

12:08.061 --> 12:10.647
Fine, then you can be
the Hokage.

12:10.981 --> 12:12.649
But stay single for
the rest of your life!

12:13.358 --> 12:16.778
The Hokage is a nuisance
to the people around him!

12:20.574 --> 12:25.162
Boruto, we need a third man too,
or we can't advance...

12:25.996 --> 12:29.750
We don't have a chance of
beating the next boss without you.

12:30.041 --> 12:31.710
Then I'll give you my data.

12:32.043 --> 12:35.213
This one has shortcuts
and is really easy.

12:36.089 --> 12:39.468
Uh, I don't really want that.

12:39.593 --> 12:41.678
It's okay,
someone gave them to me.

12:43.430 --> 12:46.391
DATA TRANSFER COMPLETE

12:46.391 --> 12:46.850
What?

12:46.975 --> 12:50.020
BORUTO MAX LEVEL

12:51.313 --> 12:52.856
Huh? You leaving?

12:52.898 --> 12:53.857
Yeah...

12:54.191 --> 12:55.776
This is only fun because

12:55.817 --> 12:58.195
I have to sneak away
from Mom to play it.

13:00.489 --> 13:02.282
Oh well, I'd better go too...

13:11.041 --> 13:13.210
We should at least have
our applications...

13:13.835 --> 13:18.882
Look, we're a team.
Can we talk about this?

13:20.342 --> 13:21.510
Come on, Boruto.

13:21.843 --> 13:25.680
Let's show Lord Seventh
what we've got!

13:25.764 --> 13:27.015
In these exams!

13:28.517 --> 13:32.312
<i>I'm sure everyone wants
to see your skills.</i>

13:32.354 --> 13:34.648
<i>Especially your father.</i>

13:38.193 --> 13:39.361
Okay already.

13:39.861 --> 13:41.905
<i>You want me to participate?
Fine, I'll participate.</i>

13:44.950 --> 13:46.034
<i>He's so simple.</i>

13:47.369 --> 13:50.580
Oh yeah, Sarada. ..
ls your dad coming to watch?

13:52.249 --> 13:54.584
Who cares about someone
who couldn't become the Hokage. . .?

13:54.709 --> 13:56.920
You're wrong.
My dad used to say...

13:56.962 --> 13:59.965
that Uncle Sasuke
is the other Hokage.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.842
He's just being modest!

14:02.300 --> 14:08.014
Sasuke is the only shinobi who could
rival the Seventh Hokage.

14:08.390 --> 14:09.891
That's according to my parent

14:09.891 --> 14:12.102
who's even more awesome
than both of your dads.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.480
What is it?

14:15.939 --> 14:18.233
Oh yeah, who're your parents anyway?

14:19.067 --> 14:20.735
You never told me either.

14:21.069 --> 14:22.279
Well, it's-

14:22.320 --> 14:23.947
Big Brother!

14:25.490 --> 14:29.494
Today's my birthday!
Hurry up and let's go home!

14:29.661 --> 14:30.620
Okay!

14:30.871 --> 14:33.164
Sorry, I've gotta go!

14:37.085 --> 14:39.462
- Hurry, Brother!
- Mom, I'll hold the bags.

14:40.714 --> 14:43.216
Himawari, we're gonna
feast tonight.

14:45.802 --> 14:48.763
So Boruto does know
how to smile.

14:50.265 --> 14:51.016
Uh-huh.

14:58.189 --> 14:58.940
Hey!

15:02.152 --> 15:03.194
So you remembered.

15:05.614 --> 15:10.869
<i>Happy. . birthday to you...</i>

15:11.286 --> 15:16.082
<i>You're a precious person...</i>

15:16.458 --> 15:21.838
<i>And it's your birthday.</i>

15:22.464 --> 15:28.178
<i>Congratulations.</i>

15:35.018 --> 15:36.311
A Shadow Clone...

15:39.940 --> 15:40.857
Boruto!

15:40.899 --> 15:41.900
Boruto!

15:41.983 --> 15:43.234
Let me go, Mom!

15:43.360 --> 15:46.571
Your father has to work hard
for the people of the village.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.449
It doesn't mean he's forgotten
about the two of you!

15:49.616 --> 15:50.575
Why?!

15:50.700 --> 15:53.036
Why did my dad have to be
the Hokage?!

15:53.244 --> 15:56.247
He just sits at his desk all day
and acts bossy!

15:56.331 --> 15:57.707
Anyone can do that!

15:58.375 --> 16:00.377
Being the Hokage is
a difficult job.

16:00.794 --> 16:03.588
It's an indispensable duty,
crucial to the survival of the village,

16:03.630 --> 16:05.048
passed down throughout
the generations.

16:05.382 --> 16:07.926
And the children of the Hokage
are expected to be grateful for

16:07.968 --> 16:10.387
being born into
this stupid situation, huh?!

16:11.012 --> 16:13.890
Oh yeah, I heard our grandpa
was also the Hokage.

16:13.974 --> 16:15.809
And when Dad was a kid,

16:15.850 --> 16:18.520
Grandpa Hokage wasn't
even alive!

16:19.312 --> 16:22.107
So I guess Dad's lucky
he never experienced

16:22.148 --> 16:24.401
the "joy" of having
a parent around.

16:26.945 --> 16:31.950
I know it's sad not to have your father
around on important days.

16:33.702 --> 16:36.746
But it's different with you.

16:36.788 --> 16:39.416
You have a father who's here.

16:41.376 --> 16:42.711
It's not about me...

16:43.420 --> 16:44.713
But Himawari...

16:47.424 --> 16:48.717
Forget it.

16:52.470 --> 16:53.638
Boruto...

17:26.963 --> 17:28.673
I messed up again...

17:31.134 --> 17:33.970
<i>Dad... What am I supposed to do?</i>

17:36.639 --> 17:37.849
Hey, what happened?!

17:39.934 --> 17:41.644
I'll finish up.

17:41.644 --> 17:43.438
You should go home and rest.

18:17.347 --> 18:20.100
It's so dirty. . .and tattered.

18:22.477 --> 18:24.938
<i>But it's different with you.</i>

18:25.980 --> 18:28.191
<i>You have a father who's here.</i>

18:31.111 --> 18:32.362
This is so uncool!

18:39.911 --> 18:41.037
<i>Could it be?</i>

18:43.123 --> 18:44.707
<i>Is Dad home?</i>

18:55.468 --> 18:58.054
I'm sorry, I thought
you were my dad...

18:59.222 --> 19:00.640
You're Naruto's son?

19:01.516 --> 19:02.559
What's your name?

19:03.518 --> 19:05.937
Boruto Uzumaki...

19:06.896 --> 19:09.357
Is that you, Sasuke?

19:11.067 --> 19:12.152
Is Naruto here?

19:13.153 --> 19:15.280
I think he's still at
the Hokage's office...

19:17.323 --> 19:19.242
I see... Sorry I bothered you.

19:19.284 --> 19:21.786
<i>He's the one
who was Dad's rival...</i>

19:22.829 --> 19:24.289
<i>He's so cool!</i>

19:41.639 --> 19:42.599
What is this?

19:44.309 --> 19:46.144
A gift from Kaguya's Palace.

19:47.228 --> 19:48.396
Sasuke!

19:51.858 --> 19:53.693
I'm getting a bad feeling about this.

19:54.569 --> 19:56.487
I can't even read it with
my Rinnegan.

19:57.071 --> 19:58.823
There was also a guy
that worries me.

19:59.324 --> 20:00.867
He didn't follow me though.

20:02.035 --> 20:03.578
Well, I guess I'm not going home.

20:04.078 --> 20:06.247
Let's figure out what
this scroll says.

20:07.707 --> 20:08.791
Oh yeah...

20:10.919 --> 20:12.337
Why do you have it?

20:12.837 --> 20:14.339
I picked it up on the way here.

20:15.256 --> 20:16.341
Oh...

20:16.841 --> 20:18.343
I also met your kid.

20:19.135 --> 20:21.054
He seems just like you
when you were young.

20:23.139 --> 20:26.893
Nah, he's nothing like
how I used to be.

20:27.268 --> 20:30.438
He's a lot more like you
when you were young.

20:31.981 --> 20:33.149
No, I take that back...

20:34.108 --> 20:36.569
He's different from you too.

20:37.570 --> 20:41.991
The clothes he wears. ..
always look brand-new.

20:43.076 --> 20:45.912
I guess we're just behind the times.

20:46.579 --> 20:47.997
You're wrong.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.833
The soul of a shinobi
remains the same.

20:51.084 --> 20:53.002
That applies to your kid too.

20:54.212 --> 20:55.588
I doubt that...

20:55.964 --> 20:59.342
Anyway, I think I win this contest.

21:01.094 --> 21:02.345
You're one to talk, loser.

21:17.986 --> 21:19.028
He disappeared!

21:24.784 --> 21:26.119
You're amazing!

21:26.452 --> 21:28.746
You used to be my dad's rival, right?

21:31.291 --> 21:33.960
I get it now...brand new, huh?

21:35.628 --> 21:37.422
Please make me your student!

21:37.588 --> 21:39.716
There's someone I want
to bring down, no matter what it takes!

21:42.844 --> 21:44.429
Can you do the Rasengan?

21:47.724 --> 21:50.184
If you can't, you can't be
a student of mine.

21:52.061 --> 21:53.438
That's a piece of cake!

21:56.649 --> 21:57.942
<i>Naruto...</i>

21:57.984 --> 22:00.695
<i>That earlier contest
isn't over and decided yet.</i>

22:02.196 --> 22:03.948
Konohamaru Sensei!

22:04.532 --> 22:06.826
Konohamaru Sensei!

22:08.161 --> 22:10.204
What's all this, eh?

22:10.830 --> 22:13.374
Please teach me your Rasengan!

22:13.708 --> 22:17.253
I have to master it right now!

22:18.755 --> 22:21.466
So you want to learn it
for the Chunin Exams

22:21.507 --> 22:23.885
and shock the Seventh Hokage.

22:23.885 --> 22:25.428
Is that it?

22:25.470 --> 22:28.473
Now you're talking like a shinobi!

22:28.723 --> 22:30.600
Well. . .yeah.

22:32.185 --> 22:34.395
<i>Imagine me,
the instructor who gets</i>

22:34.395 --> 22:36.773
<i>to pass on this jutsu
to the Hokage's son!</i>

22:36.773 --> 22:39.442
<i>Oh, Lord Fourth, Lord Seventh...!</i>

22:39.484 --> 22:43.029
<i>I swear! will fulfill this
very important duty!</i>

22:48.326 --> 22:49.952
What happened to
your enthusiasm from earlier?!

22:50.370 --> 22:51.746
Come on, once more.

22:51.871 --> 22:53.706
Watch me carefully,
then you do it like this eh?

22:53.748 --> 22:54.999
I know, I know!

22:55.124 --> 22:57.877
But it's not working at all, eh!

22:57.919 --> 23:00.296
Don't talk like me!

23:00.338 --> 23:03.925
No... "eh" means this!

23:03.925 --> 23:06.260
"Eh" means this in my hand...

23:06.260 --> 23:07.804
Quit saying eh,eh,eh!

23:07.845 --> 23:09.389
Speak for yourself!

23:11.599 --> 23:13.643
And why does it have to be
a water balloon?!

23:13.643 --> 23:16.312
Isn't there a better way
to do this?!

23:17.855 --> 23:21.859
It took Lord Fourth three years
to invent this jutsu...

23:22.193 --> 23:24.404
and another six months
to perfect it.

23:25.113 --> 23:26.989
Going by how difficult
it is to master,

23:26.989 --> 23:28.282
this is an A-rank jutsu.

23:40.962 --> 23:43.339
Damn it!
Still no good!

23:56.310 --> 23:57.228
I did it!

23:57.728 --> 23:58.688
Well done!

23:59.105 --> 24:01.315
Okay, on to the next step.

24:02.733 --> 24:04.986
What? A rubber ball this time?!

24:27.258 --> 24:30.219
No! No way...eh!

24:32.221 --> 24:33.890
All right!

24:35.266 --> 24:39.228
UCHIHA

24:49.739 --> 24:51.657
That's awfully small...

24:52.950 --> 24:55.536
I'd be hard-pressed to call
that Rasengan.

24:56.704 --> 24:57.622
But the basics are-

24:57.663 --> 24:58.831
Damn it!

25:08.508 --> 25:10.593
You're always so strict, Dad.

25:11.344 --> 25:13.930
Since you probably
don't know Boruto very well,

25:13.971 --> 25:17.266
let me tell you...
Boruto usually isn't like this.

25:18.017 --> 25:20.102
It's a miracle
he even managed this far.

25:20.102 --> 25:21.812
You get it, don't you?

25:22.271 --> 25:23.773
He jumped to
the wrong conclusion.

25:23.814 --> 25:25.358
I didn't say he failed.

25:26.150 --> 25:28.319
I was going to accept him
as my student...

25:34.700 --> 25:38.204
<i>Special sale, all items 30 to 40% off</i>

25:38.246 --> 25:40.248
<i>and double the points right now!</i>

25:40.248 --> 25:41.207
Damn it.

25:41.249 --> 25:44.001
<i>If you sign up for Hidden Leaf Net,
triple your points!</i>

25:47.755 --> 25:49.048
What's wrong?

25:50.383 --> 25:51.509
I see...

25:51.551 --> 25:53.469
That's terrible.

25:53.928 --> 25:57.056
But I have just the thing for that.

25:57.807 --> 26:02.395
It's cool...smart...and easy to use.

26:02.436 --> 26:05.523
And you'll get exceptionally
good results.

26:09.443 --> 26:11.654
And this is...

26:11.696 --> 26:16.409
what the shinobi of
your generation looks like.

26:18.327 --> 26:19.662
Wouldn't you agree?

26:24.083 --> 26:25.668
Now Young Lord...

26:25.668 --> 26:28.546
Let's choose the ultimate technique
that's perfect for you.

26:36.596 --> 26:38.431
When did I get so filthy?

26:42.935 --> 26:43.853
All right!

26:55.990 --> 26:56.991
Rasengan!

27:16.719 --> 27:17.928
Hey, hey!

27:17.970 --> 27:19.305
So what do you say?

27:21.057 --> 27:23.100
That's all from only one day?

27:23.517 --> 27:27.104
I'm not like my dad...
when it comes to talent.

27:28.147 --> 27:31.025
It seems you're quite different
from Naruto.

27:32.318 --> 27:33.736
I had hoped it wasn't the case.

27:36.447 --> 27:40.076
So? What do you say?
About making me a student?!

27:42.286 --> 27:44.872
Fine...you can be my student.

27:53.381 --> 27:55.758
Tell me about my dad.

27:58.552 --> 28:01.806
When he was a kid, all he did was go
around saying he'd become the Hokage.

28:01.847 --> 28:03.224
He was quite a loser.

28:03.474 --> 28:04.934
A loser?

28:05.226 --> 28:06.769
And stubborn as hell.

28:06.811 --> 28:08.104
No, not that!

28:08.312 --> 28:10.981
I want to know about
my dad's weaknesses, you know!

28:12.108 --> 28:13.150
Weaknesses?

28:21.033 --> 28:22.118
Listen...

28:22.159 --> 28:25.329
He was full of weaknesses.
He was a good-for-nothing.

28:26.747 --> 28:29.083
But he pulled himself up
with his own strength...

28:29.083 --> 28:30.584
and became the Hokage.

28:31.711 --> 28:34.922
You don't need to understand
who Naruto is now.

28:35.423 --> 28:37.591
You need to know the Naruto
who made it all the way here.

28:38.926 --> 28:40.553
What's that supposed to mean?

28:44.932 --> 28:46.308
It's finally time!

28:48.060 --> 28:49.311
Good luck and do your best!

28:49.311 --> 28:51.939
You're awfully lively
this morning, Mom.

28:52.064 --> 28:53.941
Does Dad coming home
after such a long time

28:53.941 --> 28:55.401
make you so happy?

28:55.443 --> 28:58.821
W-What? Don't be silly!

28:58.863 --> 29:01.657
Well, I can tell these things
about you, Mom.

29:03.534 --> 29:05.494
Anyway. I'm off!

29:08.038 --> 29:10.166
You're just as happy, Sarada.

29:17.715 --> 29:20.509
You won the bet with
my dad, Boruto.

29:21.927 --> 29:23.429
W-Well, yeah.

29:24.305 --> 29:27.850
So what will you do now
that you're my dad's student?

29:28.142 --> 29:30.686
I want to learn about
my dad's weaknesses.

29:30.853 --> 29:34.356
I don't mean to criticize you
or anything...

29:34.607 --> 29:36.901
But before you challenge
Lord Seventh...

29:36.942 --> 29:39.028
we have to become chunin.

29:39.028 --> 29:40.112
Do you understand?

29:40.321 --> 29:44.617
That's why I want to train and
learn from Uncle Sasuke

29:44.658 --> 29:46.744
and show my dad my power
at the Chunin Exams!

29:46.786 --> 29:49.413
The power that's gonna
topple him some day!

29:49.497 --> 29:51.415
It's "our" power!

29:51.832 --> 29:54.418
Really, what are you thinking?

29:54.460 --> 29:55.628
Isn't it obvious?

29:55.669 --> 29:57.505
I'm thinking we're gonna
come out on top

29:57.505 --> 29:59.215
at the Chunin Exams.

30:00.508 --> 30:02.718
CHUNIN

30:03.803 --> 30:06.472
I don't mean to criticize you
or anything...

30:06.931 --> 30:08.974
But sometimes,
you're not that irritating.

30:09.809 --> 30:12.436
Please don't forget about me, okay?

30:39.171 --> 30:42.925
I didn't expect the chakra was
dispersed in this manner.

30:43.634 --> 30:47.096
The Divine Tree has been cut down,
and there is no sign of Kaguya.

30:47.388 --> 30:49.515
It seems the creatures
of this planet

30:49.557 --> 30:51.559
have gained unnecessary knowledge.

31:00.192 --> 31:03.529
We'll just have to retrieve it
one by one.

31:05.906 --> 31:07.032
Take this!

31:17.918 --> 31:19.962
I'll give that back to you, doubled.

31:48.157 --> 31:49.825
Imagine that...

31:49.825 --> 31:53.829
High-density chakra in humans
in the form of beasts.

31:55.623 --> 31:57.499
Is that all?

31:58.167 --> 32:02.171
Well, I did use most of the pills
while traveling through Time-Space.

32:04.840 --> 32:09.595
Lord Momoshiki, there is an even
greater reaction to the east.

32:10.346 --> 32:13.349
I believe the massive accumulation
of chakra that we seek is there.

32:20.564 --> 32:21.523
How's that?

32:22.399 --> 32:24.401
You're able to bend it
a little now.

32:29.573 --> 32:30.658
The next one is that.

32:31.367 --> 32:33.410
How am I supposed
to bend it that far?

32:40.417 --> 32:44.046
Use your head a little and
don't expect an immediate answer.

32:46.340 --> 32:47.633
I know.

32:58.519 --> 33:01.438
You must be victorious,
Boruto, no matter what.

33:03.357 --> 33:04.775
When you're in a bind,

33:04.817 --> 33:06.485
Scientific Ninja Tools will
come to your rescue.

33:10.406 --> 33:13.200
There's no need to think
so hard over it.

33:27.423 --> 33:29.341
<i>Is he even going to try?</i>

33:30.175 --> 33:32.928
<i>Well, he is my son,
so it can't be helped.</i>

33:36.056 --> 33:39.226
We will now begin
the Chunin Selection Exam.

33:39.810 --> 33:43.731
<i>Everyone, this is the time to utilize
everything you've learned so far!</i>

33:44.314 --> 33:45.774
<i>Just watch, stupid old man...</i>

33:46.233 --> 33:49.111
<i>I'm gonna make it to the end
with my strength!</i>

33:49.653 --> 33:52.156
<i>All right, we will begin Round One.</i>

33:55.409 --> 33:57.703
<i>Each team of three will stand
on the side</i>

33:57.745 --> 33:59.246
<i>they believe is the correct answer.</i>

33:59.705 --> 34:01.457
Here is the question!

34:01.665 --> 34:07.588
TRUE OR FALSE THE PASSWORDS IN VOL. 5 ARE: MOON
IS DAY. MOUNTAIN IS RIVER. FLOWER IS NECTAR.

34:07.588 --> 34:08.255
<i>Moon is day.</i>

34:08.255 --> 34:09.590
<i>Mountain is river.</i>

34:09.590 --> 34:11.425
<i>Flower is nectar.</i>

34:11.800 --> 34:13.342
<i>- True or false?
-</i> I <i>don't know that story!</i>

34:14.928 --> 34:16.972
Sarada, do you know the novel?

34:17.097 --> 34:18.139
Sort of...

34:18.348 --> 34:22.101
But I've only read up to Volume 4.

34:22.561 --> 34:24.605
I didn't even know
there was a fifth volume.

34:24.855 --> 34:26.482
Then we may as well give up.

34:26.523 --> 34:28.484
At least give it some thought, Mitsuki.

34:29.443 --> 34:32.529
Boruto, which do you think
my dad would choose?

34:34.572 --> 34:35.699
Probably false.

34:35.741 --> 34:37.326
He's not the conventional type.

34:37.326 --> 34:39.036
But hey, what's this all of a sudden?

34:39.453 --> 34:41.246
I plan to become the Hokage

34:41.288 --> 34:43.040
by choosing a different path
from my dad!

34:43.665 --> 34:45.125
Then we should go for true, right?

34:45.125 --> 34:47.335
Yeah! Let's go, guys!

34:50.755 --> 34:52.591
All right, you've all decided
on your answer.

34:52.800 --> 34:53.926
The wrong answer is...

34:53.967 --> 34:57.179
In other words,
those who turn black will fail.

35:00.641 --> 35:01.850
What do you mean
by "turn black"?

35:02.309 --> 35:03.602
You'll see...

35:05.312 --> 35:06.480
The answer is...

35:16.949 --> 35:18.534
We got it wrong!

35:18.575 --> 35:19.868
Damn it!

35:22.079 --> 35:24.373
Ink! It's a pool of ink!

35:24.998 --> 35:26.166
I get it.

35:31.713 --> 35:32.840
Damn it!

35:34.216 --> 35:35.843
Is it all over?

35:54.027 --> 35:55.112
Over there...

35:55.195 --> 35:56.697
Is that the "false" hole?

35:57.531 --> 36:00.325
This true or false choice
probably has no meaning.

36:00.826 --> 36:03.453
That quiz was a sham
from the start!

36:03.537 --> 36:06.123
There was no volume 5!

36:06.290 --> 36:09.293
Those who fail will turn black...

36:09.835 --> 36:11.628
Those were his words.

36:11.962 --> 36:14.756
So as long as you don't
turn black, you're okay.

36:15.090 --> 36:18.218
It's exactly the kind of awkward
and oblivious test my clad would make.

36:21.305 --> 36:22.472
Precisely!

36:23.098 --> 36:26.476
After seeing the pool of ink
and realizing your mistake,

36:26.560 --> 36:28.729
if you gave up and
let yourself plunge into black ink...

36:28.770 --> 36:31.607
you don't deserve to
become a chunin.

36:32.191 --> 36:34.943
<i>The real purpose of
the first round was to see</i>

36:35.027 --> 36:37.279
<i>the second answer you were forced
to make instantly after</i>

36:37.321 --> 36:39.698
<i>being driven into a difficult situation...
Whether you gave up or not.</i>

36:40.866 --> 36:43.368
Those who didn't fall into
the ink are correct.

36:43.869 --> 36:46.955
This marks the end of Round One
of the Chunin Selection Exams!

36:48.165 --> 36:50.125
The second round will
begin in three days!

36:50.918 --> 36:51.835
All right!

36:51.919 --> 36:53.003
We did it.

36:59.593 --> 37:02.221
He managed to make it
through, somehow.

37:06.433 --> 37:09.853
Boruto's team made it
through Round One.

37:10.270 --> 37:11.605
O-Oh...

37:14.024 --> 37:16.443
Are you still thinking
about last time?

37:18.737 --> 37:21.156
I'm one to talk, but...

37:21.740 --> 37:24.159
maybe you should give him
a pep talk?

37:57.567 --> 38:02.406
CONGRATULATIONS ON PASSING THE FIRST ROUND.
GOOD LUCK ON THE NEXT ONE! - DAD.

38:04.866 --> 38:06.201
An email?

38:07.744 --> 38:09.705
He didn't even send
a Shadow Clone?

38:10.831 --> 38:12.165
Stupid old man...

38:28.724 --> 38:31.977
Everyone knows Shuriken Jutsu
is Sarada's specialty!

38:32.269 --> 38:33.937
I mean...she's your...

38:34.021 --> 38:36.064
She's an Uchiha, after all!

38:36.440 --> 38:39.151
According to your reasoning, Boruto...

38:42.529 --> 38:45.657
This jutsu should be
your specialty too.

38:45.741 --> 38:46.700
I guess so...

38:46.742 --> 38:49.077
This was Dad's specialty, right?

38:49.369 --> 38:50.871
You can't make any more excuses.

38:51.413 --> 38:53.749
Naruto can make over
a thousand Shadow Clones.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.084
I know that!

38:57.961 --> 39:00.756
I'll <i>blow them away
during Round Two!</i>

39:02.049 --> 39:03.467
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

39:06.887 --> 39:09.222
I guess four is still my limit.

39:14.561 --> 39:16.688
<i>Round Two consists
of capturing a flag.</i>

39:16.730 --> 39:20.609
<i>Guard the flag in your territory
while you encroach on enemy territory.</i>

39:20.692 --> 39:22.277
<i>Namely, this is an offensive
and defensive battle!</i>

39:22.361 --> 39:24.446
<i>It's three against three so,</i>

39:24.529 --> 39:28.116
<i>half the teams will be dropped
after this round.</i>

39:54.935 --> 39:57.312
Most of the matches are over.

39:58.313 --> 40:01.733
There's just one set of teams left.

40:02.734 --> 40:04.694
I don't see the enemy,
are we okay?

40:05.362 --> 40:08.573
<i>I'm guarding our flag.
So relax and just attack!</i>

40:10.826 --> 40:12.202
We're counting on you, Boruto!

40:12.911 --> 40:15.497
<i>If we're going to show Lord Seventh
how strong we are,</i>

40:15.580 --> 40:17.916
<i>we have to make it through
this second round.</i>

40:19.501 --> 40:22.337
I don't need you to remind me!

40:24.673 --> 40:26.049
Your surprise attack didn't work.

40:27.634 --> 40:28.969
It's five against three.

40:29.010 --> 40:31.263
You know who has
the advantage, don't you?

40:41.731 --> 40:43.692
Who has the advantage now?

40:46.653 --> 40:48.488
<i>Sarada! Go!</i>

40:49.156 --> 40:51.074
I'll rejoin you soon!

41:11.803 --> 41:12.762
<i>Boruto!</i>

41:25.775 --> 41:29.029
There's no water around, but he has
a Water Style this powerful?

41:44.044 --> 41:45.754
He even knows...

41:46.004 --> 41:47.506
Lightning Style?

41:51.134 --> 41:52.427
I'm okay now.

41:53.053 --> 41:55.222
<i>Sarada! Go for the flag!</i>

41:55.430 --> 41:56.848
That's what I'm doing...

42:09.861 --> 42:11.112
We did it!

42:15.450 --> 42:16.952
I guess we managed somehow...

42:17.369 --> 42:19.496
Yeah... It was a piece of cake.

42:20.038 --> 42:21.623
As expected, Boruto...

42:21.665 --> 42:24.668
You're a shinobi who's going
to be the Hokage one day.

42:24.918 --> 42:26.753
<i>Excuse me!
But that's gonna be me!</i>

42:38.765 --> 42:39.849
He's good.

42:40.725 --> 42:42.310
I couldn't even see him
weaving signs.

42:42.727 --> 42:45.146
Leave it to the son
of Lord Seventh...

42:45.981 --> 42:47.649
Okay, that makes four teams.

42:48.233 --> 42:49.192
This round is over.

42:49.651 --> 42:51.403
Thanks, Shino.
You've been a big help.

42:51.444 --> 42:52.737
He got through the second round too.

42:53.488 --> 42:55.323
It seems he used it
this time around.

42:55.490 --> 42:58.243
<i>I see... Did you get footage of it?</i>

42:58.326 --> 42:59.202
Yes.

43:00.870 --> 43:02.330
Next up is the third test!

43:02.831 --> 43:03.665
Yeah...

43:05.542 --> 43:06.626
Boruto!

43:06.751 --> 43:08.878
This means...finally...

43:08.962 --> 43:11.965
Lord Seventh will get to witness
how strong we are!

43:12.007 --> 43:13.842
Can't you be a little more excited?

43:14.009 --> 43:15.635
<i>I-I know!</i>

43:20.807 --> 43:21.850
I knew it.

43:22.559 --> 43:25.979
Your eyes are bluer than
the Seventh's...

43:28.440 --> 43:29.232
Really?

43:31.234 --> 43:32.819
They are! I'm sure of it!

43:33.820 --> 43:34.988
You pay close attention, don't you?

43:35.030 --> 43:36.781
Ask him to show you next time.

43:36.823 --> 43:40.076
Lord Seventh is nice,
so he won't say no.

43:53.131 --> 43:54.466
Uh. yes?

43:59.679 --> 44:00.889
I'm impressed.

44:01.598 --> 44:02.557
About what?

44:02.599 --> 44:04.809
Boruto and his team, of course.

44:04.851 --> 44:06.311
They got through Round Two.

44:07.187 --> 44:08.271
Th-They did, huh?

44:09.230 --> 44:10.190
Well, see you.

44:11.524 --> 44:13.401
You came all the way here
just to tell me that?

44:14.527 --> 44:16.404
Well, it's important news.

44:17.280 --> 44:20.158
By the way, Shikadai's team
made it too.

44:20.575 --> 44:23.244
We just might see a battle
between our sons!

44:36.716 --> 44:38.760
Is it going to take more time
to decipher?

44:39.010 --> 44:41.388
Sorry, looks like they hit a snag.

44:42.222 --> 44:43.807
I see... I'll come back later.

44:43.890 --> 44:44.891
Sasuke...

44:46.393 --> 44:49.270
I hear you're training him.

44:49.854 --> 44:51.147
Did Boruto tell you that?

44:51.398 --> 44:53.400
No, Konohamaru did...

44:53.900 --> 44:54.943
I see.

44:55.276 --> 44:57.278
Maybe you were right...

44:58.405 --> 45:00.699
The soul of a shinobi
remains the same.

45:02.951 --> 45:04.994
I believe that to be true.

45:10.166 --> 45:11.251
I'm home.

45:11.793 --> 45:13.461
Welcome home!

45:15.088 --> 45:16.631
Congratulations, Big Brother!

45:17.924 --> 45:20.844
I just passed Round Two.
It's no big deal, you know!

45:21.136 --> 45:22.345
Are you hurt?

45:22.429 --> 45:23.888
I'm fine.

45:24.305 --> 45:27.475
But I'm tired, so I'm just
going up to my room.

45:29.769 --> 45:31.104
I don't need any dinner, either.

45:33.857 --> 45:35.066
KNOCK BEFORE ENTERING!!

45:53.626 --> 45:56.421
H-Hey, I said I don't need dinner.

45:58.798 --> 45:59.841
What is it?

46:05.096 --> 46:06.473
D-Dad!

46:11.728 --> 46:12.896
<i>I...</i>

46:13.646 --> 46:16.065
I heard you passed
the Second Round.

46:16.483 --> 46:17.901
Y-Yeah.

46:20.320 --> 46:22.530
I...um...

46:28.661 --> 46:29.621
What is it?

46:39.464 --> 46:41.549
If it's nothing, can you go?

46:45.136 --> 46:45.887
You...

46:52.018 --> 46:53.603
You did well.

46:59.484 --> 47:00.360
Well, see you later.

47:01.110 --> 47:02.570
You came up just to say that?

47:04.113 --> 47:06.324
Well, it's important.

47:09.369 --> 47:12.080
It's very important.

47:14.749 --> 47:16.292
Oh, one more thing...

47:16.668 --> 47:17.752
W-What?

47:20.713 --> 47:22.423
Don't lose to Shikadai!

47:31.808 --> 47:33.393
L-Like I'd lose!

47:38.231 --> 47:39.524
I'll be watching.

47:42.068 --> 47:43.069
See you later.

47:50.410 --> 47:52.787
If that's all he had to say,
he could've just emailed.

48:08.261 --> 48:09.220
Stupid old man.

48:47.258 --> 48:48.635
It's time.

48:48.843 --> 48:49.802
Yeah.

48:52.347 --> 48:54.933
I am sure you are all aware...

48:54.974 --> 48:57.060
But Round Three consists
of individual matches!

48:57.310 --> 49:00.730
You will probably face a teammate
who knows your skills.

49:00.813 --> 49:03.191
You will have three matches.
The winners in...

49:03.274 --> 49:08.112
<i>Blocks A, B, and C
will battle in a three-way final.</i>

49:09.489 --> 49:10.949
<i>Are you ready?</i>

49:10.990 --> 49:12.075
- Yes!
- Yes!

49:13.993 --> 49:15.870
BORUTO UZUMAKI
vs. YURUI

49:15.870 --> 49:19.540
<i>Round Three of the Chunin
Selection Exams will now begin.</i>

49:20.541 --> 49:21.918
Challengers, step forward!

49:23.544 --> 49:25.630
Boruto Uzumaki of
the Hidden Leaf and...

49:25.672 --> 49:27.548
Yurui of the Hidden Cloud.

49:29.384 --> 49:31.970
First match, begin!

49:38.434 --> 49:41.270
You're all going down
in one fell swoop.

49:42.605 --> 49:43.940
"One fell swoop"?

49:44.023 --> 49:46.317
It means you're gonna lose!

49:46.943 --> 49:50.321
Then just say it and don't beat
around the bush!

49:50.989 --> 49:53.908
Maybe I'll stop beating around
the bush with this match.

49:56.869 --> 49:57.912
Like I'll let you!

50:02.375 --> 50:03.960
They explode?

50:19.726 --> 50:21.519
<i>You did well.</i>

50:27.400 --> 50:28.818
I'm not gonna...

50:29.360 --> 50:30.820
...lose here!

50:39.203 --> 50:41.497
<i>It won't reach all the way here.</i>

50:51.382 --> 50:53.176
How did he bend it that much?

50:59.057 --> 51:02.268
Sorry. . .but it looks like I took you down
in "one fell swoop."

51:02.435 --> 51:05.354
Um. . .was it Charai (flashy)?

51:05.480 --> 51:07.148
It's Yurui.

51:08.274 --> 51:11.235
Winner, the Hidden Leaf's
Boruto Uzumaki!

51:12.111 --> 51:13.529
He won! He won!

51:15.531 --> 51:17.825
That kid's good.

51:19.327 --> 51:21.037
All right, I'll win too!

51:21.370 --> 51:23.164
Cha!

51:25.458 --> 51:26.876
<i>Aww yeah!</i>

51:27.877 --> 51:31.756
SARADA TARUI

51:33.633 --> 51:36.010
TOROI MITSUKI

51:40.056 --> 51:42.266
INOJIN YAMANAKA
vs. ARAYA

51:45.186 --> 51:47.647
BORUTO UZUMAKI
vs. SHIKADAI NARA

51:49.690 --> 51:50.942
<i>Seventh match...</i>

51:51.275 --> 51:52.151
<i>Begin!</i>

51:57.907 --> 51:58.908
Shadow Clones?

52:30.523 --> 52:33.192
It would be great if
you gave up soon.

52:57.884 --> 52:59.302
I give up.

53:00.720 --> 53:02.763
Doesn't this scene look familiar?

53:03.764 --> 53:07.059
It'll be our turn to take
the stage soon.

53:07.560 --> 53:11.147
That young fool wields it nicely
without exposing himself.

53:17.236 --> 53:19.614
<i>The winner is Boruto Uzumaki
of the Hidden Leaf!</i>

53:20.031 --> 53:21.949
He moves on to the final!

53:21.991 --> 53:23.117
Yes!

53:25.411 --> 53:26.787
Amazing.

53:27.830 --> 53:29.457
What's the matter, dear?

53:29.999 --> 53:33.544
Hinata. .. Use your Byakugan
and check out Boruto's hand.

53:38.549 --> 53:41.302
This is what we deciphered
from the scroll.

53:41.928 --> 53:44.222
My suspicions were right
on the mark.

53:44.347 --> 53:45.765
Is something wrong?

53:46.015 --> 53:48.267
We have to let Naruto
know immediately.

53:48.351 --> 53:50.811
Unfortunately, we'll need to
postpone the exams.

53:53.606 --> 53:54.482
Well?

53:54.857 --> 53:56.400
It's some kind of ninja tool...

53:56.442 --> 53:58.402
It seems he had it attached
to his arm...

53:58.819 --> 53:59.987
Is it-?

54:01.948 --> 54:04.033
What's with the Hokage?

54:04.408 --> 54:05.868
He's so proud of his son,

54:05.952 --> 54:08.079
he couldn't stop himself
from going out there?

54:08.371 --> 54:10.539
There's a doting parent for you.

54:15.044 --> 54:16.712
Dad, did you see that?!

54:17.505 --> 54:19.465
Next up is the final round!

54:36.023 --> 54:37.483
What's this about?

54:42.697 --> 54:43.656
This is...

54:44.282 --> 54:46.826
This is prohibited in the Exams.

54:47.660 --> 54:50.621
Using a ninja tool instead
of your own chakra

54:50.663 --> 54:52.707
defeats the purpose
of the Chunin Exams

54:52.748 --> 54:54.333
which is to nurture new shinobi.

54:55.835 --> 54:58.254
Lee, Boruto Uzumaki
is disqualified.

54:58.671 --> 55:00.840
Please change the winner
to Shikadai Nara.

55:01.590 --> 55:02.925
He's been exposed!

55:03.009 --> 55:05.386
We have no choice
but to act now.

55:06.220 --> 55:09.390
NARUTO UZUMAKI
vs. SHIKADAI NARA

55:09.390 --> 55:09.557
Boruto Uzumaki has
been disqualified

55:09.640 --> 55:11.392
for using an illegal ninja tool!

55:12.018 --> 55:13.394
<i>- He didn't fool around, did he?
- Therefore, the winner is...</i>

55:13.436 --> 55:14.937
<i>- Violating</i> a <i>rule like that.
- Shikadai Nara from the Hidden Leaf.</i>

55:15.980 --> 55:17.273
So this is what it's like...

55:17.356 --> 55:19.525
to have an idiot son who drags
the Hokage's name through the mud.

55:19.942 --> 55:21.277
You're kidding...

55:21.819 --> 55:23.446
When did he get that?

55:25.197 --> 55:26.407
Boruto...

55:29.327 --> 55:31.787
You're disqualified as a ninja.

55:32.288 --> 55:34.081
What happened to Big Brother?

55:34.123 --> 55:35.833
Did he do something bad?

55:38.711 --> 55:39.754
Boruto...

55:42.590 --> 55:43.758
Come with me.

55:44.008 --> 55:45.426
We're in the middle of exams.

55:45.509 --> 55:46.969
We'll talk later.

55:49.638 --> 55:51.807
You'll talk to me later?

55:52.725 --> 55:56.354
Do you have the time, Dad?

55:56.395 --> 55:58.731
If you had lectured me
before all this...

55:59.815 --> 56:01.359
I'd...

56:02.610 --> 56:06.447
I would have...never ended up
in a situation like this!

56:13.287 --> 56:14.997
He's right, you know.

56:15.164 --> 56:17.166
Boruto wasn't able to win,

56:17.249 --> 56:20.669
and we're so disappointed...
Lord Seventh.

56:21.796 --> 56:22.963
To be honest,

56:23.005 --> 56:25.591
I wanted to make this
announcement after he won.

56:25.883 --> 56:26.759
You guys!

56:27.551 --> 56:29.345
Listen, everyone!

56:29.428 --> 56:32.306
Boruto used
a Scientific Ninja Tool!

56:32.765 --> 56:34.308
<i>It was prohibited here...</i>

56:34.350 --> 56:36.602
<i>But, there is no denying that
this Scientific Ninja Tool</i>

56:36.644 --> 56:38.896
<i>made it possible for him
to reach this point!</i>

56:40.314 --> 56:41.440
Katasuke!

56:41.941 --> 56:45.027
That is why, Five Kage and
everyone from the villages...

56:45.111 --> 56:47.571
This was the perfect venue to demonstrate
this amazing Scientific Ninja Tool and-

56:53.577 --> 56:55.830
Get behind me, quick!

56:57.289 --> 56:59.667
Hey, hey!
What's with you guys?!

56:59.917 --> 57:01.252
Don't approach them!

57:02.128 --> 57:04.672
This arena is where
I show off my...

57:22.523 --> 57:24.275
Our top priority is
to prevent any casualties.

57:47.381 --> 57:50.217
I can see the fox with
my Byakugan.

57:51.135 --> 57:53.512
It's dangerous here,
go to where the others are-!

58:06.609 --> 58:08.694
This child is the last one remaining.

58:08.861 --> 58:10.488
Take care of her.

58:10.529 --> 58:12.406
I'm going to check over there.

58:14.366 --> 58:15.242
Sarada!

58:26.504 --> 58:27.421
Dad?!

58:27.505 --> 58:28.881
You don't look like you're hurt.

58:31.008 --> 58:32.259
This is payback for last time!

59:15.177 --> 59:16.637
That was close!

59:18.097 --> 59:19.640
Boruto! Are you all right?

59:19.890 --> 59:21.267
Yeah, what about you?

59:23.018 --> 59:24.270
How trivial.

59:29.275 --> 59:30.526
It was sucked in?!

59:31.068 --> 59:32.152
Kinshiki.

59:32.611 --> 59:33.487
Yes!

59:37.116 --> 59:39.159
We can't use our powers here.

59:39.493 --> 59:41.078
We'll end up dragging
everyone into this.

59:41.203 --> 59:43.455
It seems like I'm their target.

59:43.789 --> 59:45.165
I'll lure them.

59:45.708 --> 59:47.293
Who are you?!

59:48.085 --> 59:50.296
I am Kinshiki Otsutsuki...

59:50.462 --> 59:52.965
This is Lord Momoshiki Otsutsuki.

59:53.465 --> 59:55.175
What do you want with me?

59:55.217 --> 59:57.720
We will turn the scattered chakra
into one fruit,

59:57.803 --> 01:00:01.473
and finish what Kaguya failed
to do on this seedbed.

01:00:02.224 --> 01:00:03.517
According to the scroll...

01:00:03.559 --> 01:00:06.353
It was recorded that these guys would
come to steal the fruit of the chakra...

01:00:07.313 --> 01:00:10.316
That's why Kaguya was amassing
an army of White Zetsu...

01:00:10.399 --> 01:00:13.152
First Kaguya, and now this...

01:00:13.902 --> 01:00:15.404
What do they plan to do
with the fruit?

01:00:15.487 --> 01:00:17.156
They plan on making pills.

01:00:17.323 --> 01:00:18.449
Pills?

01:00:18.824 --> 01:00:20.034
Medicine.

01:00:20.284 --> 01:00:22.411
Precisely. As long as we have this,

01:00:22.494 --> 01:00:26.206
we are eternally young,
immortal, and invincible!

01:00:26.582 --> 01:00:28.709
You poor, inconvenient humans...

01:00:28.834 --> 01:00:31.670
Unless you train and
persevere senselessly,

01:00:31.712 --> 01:00:33.547
you get nowhere.

01:00:34.465 --> 01:00:35.758
Watch me!

01:00:35.841 --> 01:00:39.470
With this pill, instantly,
with no effort, and so easily...

01:00:39.511 --> 01:00:41.555
I acquire true power.

01:00:41.597 --> 01:00:42.890
Quit kidding around!

01:00:43.057 --> 01:00:45.017
That's not true power!

01:00:46.435 --> 01:00:49.271
Vulgar creatures like you
wouldn't understand...

01:00:50.648 --> 01:00:51.690
What will you do?

01:00:52.566 --> 01:00:55.986
I didn't want to soil my garments,
but I shall do it anyway.

01:00:56.487 --> 01:01:01.116
I'll have to rearrange this seedbed
and make it beautiful anyway.

01:01:04.703 --> 01:01:07.456
There's also the jutsu I acquired earlier.

01:01:16.048 --> 01:01:17.049
No...

01:01:46.912 --> 01:01:48.122
It's meaningless.

01:02:05.806 --> 01:02:07.057
What is this?

01:02:08.267 --> 01:02:10.185
<i>I didn't know
Dad had power like this...</i>

01:02:17.901 --> 01:02:18.736
Here!

01:02:19.111 --> 01:02:19.903
Here!

01:02:25.117 --> 01:02:28.662
If the real you goes down,
it's all over!

01:02:29.121 --> 01:02:30.706
Thanks, Sasuke.

01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:49.349
Naruto...

01:03:07.826 --> 01:03:09.536
It will all be over after this.

01:03:10.496 --> 01:03:12.748
But you must not die, Fox.

01:03:18.837 --> 01:03:21.465
Sasuke. .. Take care of them both.

01:03:26.929 --> 01:03:27.888
I got it.

01:03:31.058 --> 01:03:32.518
- Uncle!
- Dad!

01:03:33.685 --> 01:03:35.229
Let's do this, Kurama!

01:03:35.312 --> 01:03:37.231
You'd better not be out of shape!

01:03:37.856 --> 01:03:39.024
Don't be stupid!

01:03:39.107 --> 01:03:40.692
I'm ready to go anytime!

01:03:41.193 --> 01:03:41.944
Right!

01:04:15.727 --> 01:04:16.812
<i>Listen...</i>

01:04:16.895 --> 01:04:20.107
<i>He was full of weaknesses.
He was a good-for-nothing.</i>

01:04:20.858 --> 01:04:23.151
<i>But he pulled himself up
with his own strength...</i>

01:04:23.235 --> 01:04:24.570
<i>and became the Hokage.</i>

01:04:25.529 --> 01:04:28.866
<i>You don't need to understand
who Naruto is now.</i>

01:04:29.032 --> 01:04:31.285
<i>You need to know the Naruto
who made it all the way here.</i>

01:04:36.415 --> 01:04:37.332
Dad!

01:04:47.217 --> 01:04:48.385
You're awake.

01:04:51.847 --> 01:04:52.931
Is this the hospital?

01:04:53.181 --> 01:04:56.101
Everyone's been
transported here.

01:04:56.810 --> 01:04:58.896
Lord Seventh protected us all.

01:05:00.397 --> 01:05:01.398
I see.

01:05:02.441 --> 01:05:03.442
So everyone's safe?

01:05:03.483 --> 01:05:04.151
Mama!

01:05:04.735 --> 01:05:05.652
Himawari?!

01:05:08.113 --> 01:05:08.864
Hinata!

01:05:09.114 --> 01:05:10.782
It's me. Can you hear me?

01:05:11.366 --> 01:05:12.326
Mom!

01:05:12.868 --> 01:05:14.620
It's all right. She'll be okay.

01:05:15.412 --> 01:05:16.830
What happened, Mom?!

01:05:17.956 --> 01:05:19.458
She charged after him.

01:05:19.917 --> 01:05:21.335
Why'd she do something
crazy like that?!

01:05:22.544 --> 01:05:24.212
She tried to get Naruto back...

01:05:28.675 --> 01:05:30.969
SEVENTH

01:05:49.988 --> 01:05:51.073
Boruto...

01:05:54.826 --> 01:05:55.911
<i>Boruto...</i>

01:07:02.769 --> 01:07:04.438
<i>And when Dad was a kid,</i>

01:07:04.479 --> 01:07:07.566
<i>Grandpa Hokage wasn't even alive!</i>

01:07:08.233 --> 01:07:10.610
<i>So I guess Dad's lucky
he never experienced</i>

01:07:10.652 --> 01:07:13.071
<i>the "joy" of having
a parent around!</i>

01:07:14.072 --> 01:07:16.158
<i>Why does my dad have
to be the Hokage?!</i>

01:07:17.117 --> 01:07:20.037
<i>He just sits at his desk all day
and acts bossy!</i>

01:07:20.287 --> 01:07:21.663
<i>Anyone can do that!</i>

01:08:11.671 --> 01:08:13.048
l am...

01:08:14.466 --> 01:08:15.509
so uncool.

01:08:18.053 --> 01:08:19.345
You've got that right.

01:08:21.555 --> 01:08:24.518
At the Exams,
everyone scorned you.

01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:26.978
You were stripped of
your headband

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:28.854
and you can't even call yourself
a shinobi right now.

01:08:29.147 --> 01:08:30.816
On top of that,
you made your little sister cry,

01:08:30.857 --> 01:08:33.693
your mother's been hurt,
and your father is gone.

01:08:35.654 --> 01:08:37.488
If it weren't for your sister
who adores you

01:08:37.531 --> 01:08:40.242
and your mother who worries
so much about you...

01:08:40.325 --> 01:08:42.661
you'd be in the same situation
your dad used to be in the past.

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:46.372
So, what are you going to do?

01:08:52.671 --> 01:08:53.712
My dad...

01:08:56.633 --> 01:08:58.635
How did my dad do it?

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:03.098
Seems you're not just interested
in his weaknesses anymore.

01:09:04.015 --> 01:09:05.725
Ask Naruto yourself.

01:09:06.643 --> 01:09:07.727
I'm going to rescue him.

01:09:08.185 --> 01:09:10.063
I can sense his chakra.

01:09:10.897 --> 01:09:13.441
In other words,
he's not dead yet.

01:09:14.359 --> 01:09:18.529
Uncle Sasuke,
why do you bother with me?

01:09:19.029 --> 01:09:21.323
You're actually
a very strong shinobi.

01:09:22.075 --> 01:09:23.660
I lost to him...

01:09:24.411 --> 01:09:27.330
but you can become someone
who surpasses him.

01:09:27.538 --> 01:09:29.249
How can you tell?

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:32.377
You're his son,

01:09:32.586 --> 01:09:34.587
and you're my number one student, right?

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:37.090
And besides,

01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:40.760
you're a bigger loser
than Naruto ever was.

01:09:41.261 --> 01:09:44.346
A loser, does that mean. . .?

01:09:46.433 --> 01:09:48.602
I mean, you hate to lose.

01:09:55.817 --> 01:09:58.236
Aren't you forgetting about us?

01:09:59.112 --> 01:10:01.323
We can't ignore the Hokage

01:10:01.406 --> 01:10:03.408
and disgrace the reputations
of the Five Kage.

01:10:03.450 --> 01:10:04.784
Let's do it!

01:10:06.036 --> 01:10:07.787
Wow... The Five Kage...

01:10:09.122 --> 01:10:11.541
This feels just like the old days
with Naruto...

01:10:11.583 --> 01:10:13.585
I feel my power surging.

01:10:14.085 --> 01:10:16.671
No, there's still something missing.

01:10:21.676 --> 01:10:22.844
This is...

01:10:28.183 --> 01:10:29.643
With this Rinnegan,

01:10:29.684 --> 01:10:32.687
the number of shinobi
I can send after them is limited.

01:10:33.521 --> 01:10:35.482
Considering our present
battle strength,

01:10:35.523 --> 01:10:37.108
this is the best we can do.

01:10:37.442 --> 01:10:38.693
Take care of Naruto.

01:10:41.947 --> 01:10:42.989
Boruto!

01:10:45.951 --> 01:10:46.952
Mom!

01:10:49.704 --> 01:10:50.664
Boruto...

01:11:17.983 --> 01:11:19.359
I'm gonna go.

01:11:30.412 --> 01:11:32.872
You're finally carrying yourself
like a shinobi...

01:11:33.498 --> 01:11:34.332
Let's go!

01:11:35.625 --> 01:11:38.211
Sarada, Mitsuki...
Take care of everyone!

01:11:42.716 --> 01:11:45.552
Boruto. ..
Take care of your father.

01:11:52.726 --> 01:11:53.810
It's them!

01:12:19.294 --> 01:12:20.670
This is taking too long.

01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:24.841
Sorry about that.

01:12:25.842 --> 01:12:30.555
You see... We ninja...

01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:33.808
don't like to make things easy.

01:12:36.394 --> 01:12:37.270
Let's do this!

01:12:44.986 --> 01:12:47.322
Don't think you can
get away from us.

01:12:47.822 --> 01:12:49.240
Vulgar creatures!

01:12:53.286 --> 01:12:54.579
Sasuke...

01:12:54.621 --> 01:12:58.583
And you too?
Why are you wearing that?

01:12:58.833 --> 01:13:00.293
Things happened...

01:13:00.335 --> 01:13:03.296
And well, he's become
a shinobi.

01:13:08.051 --> 01:13:10.970
I feel like I'm looking at
my own Shadow Clone.

01:13:11.137 --> 01:13:13.640
Do I look a little cool at least?

01:13:14.349 --> 01:13:15.767
More than before.

01:13:17.435 --> 01:13:19.979
So you were keeping
an eye on me a little.

01:13:22.607 --> 01:13:26.277
I'm sorry...
for everything up until now.

01:13:28.196 --> 01:13:29.072
From now on-

01:13:29.114 --> 01:13:30.657
It's fine the way it was.

01:13:32.325 --> 01:13:35.745
But, when you can manage
to be around, instead of lecturing me...

01:13:36.204 --> 01:13:39.624
I want you to tell me stories
about your past.

01:13:41.626 --> 01:13:42.502
Sure...

01:13:51.469 --> 01:13:52.762
You're cornered.

01:13:52.804 --> 01:13:54.431
Aren't you talking about yourself?

01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:56.099
You impudent-!

01:14:02.230 --> 01:14:03.106
Honenuki: Bone Mutilation!

01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:04.065
Kurotsuchi!

01:14:04.315 --> 01:14:05.859
Ash Stone Sealing Jutsu!

01:14:07.902 --> 01:14:09.446
We'll hold him here!

01:14:21.791 --> 01:14:23.001
Sorry we're late!

01:14:23.042 --> 01:14:24.043
Naruto!

01:14:24.127 --> 01:14:25.462
Don't use ninjutsu on them!

01:14:29.841 --> 01:14:34.554
You can absorb jutsu,
and then release it. . .right?

01:14:35.096 --> 01:14:37.724
It's the same set-up as those toys
from the Scientific Ninja Tools Team.

01:14:38.391 --> 01:14:40.935
Then we'll go with taijutsu.

01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:42.729
That's a simple deduction.

01:14:49.027 --> 01:14:50.528
Lord Momoshiki...

01:15:30.026 --> 01:15:33.905
Now, Lord Momoshiki.

01:15:34.781 --> 01:15:38.409
It seems the time has come
to consume my chakra.

01:15:39.369 --> 01:15:41.162
Just as in the past,

01:15:41.246 --> 01:15:44.290
when my guardian entrusted me
with their power...

01:15:45.291 --> 01:15:47.043
Do not waver.

01:15:48.253 --> 01:15:49.504
Like I would!

01:16:27.125 --> 01:16:29.002
It's like I'm looking at the old me.

01:16:29.794 --> 01:16:31.045
No kidding.

01:16:31.879 --> 01:16:35.383
Let's teach him a lesson. . .Sasuke!

01:16:35.633 --> 01:16:36.509
Yeah!

01:18:53.104 --> 01:18:54.313
Amazing. . .!

01:19:02.947 --> 01:19:06.159
Make sure you get the power of
this Scientific Ninja Tool on camera!

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:06.826
Right!

01:19:06.909 --> 01:19:07.910
Take this!

01:19:07.952 --> 01:19:10.163
This is payback for what
you did to me earlier!

01:19:17.712 --> 01:19:20.757
There they go again, interfering...

01:19:20.965 --> 01:19:22.133
Them again!

01:19:22.967 --> 01:19:26.095
You have my thanks, fools!

01:20:03.007 --> 01:20:04.217
My chakra...

01:20:05.259 --> 01:20:07.553
This is a fine ability...

01:20:12.517 --> 01:20:14.894
Now, I'll be careful with you.

01:20:15.019 --> 01:20:16.729
I won't kill the fox.

01:20:17.563 --> 01:20:19.565
But the rest are nuisances.

01:20:26.447 --> 01:20:27.406
Now's the time!

01:20:27.865 --> 01:20:30.409
Remember what I said...
Now release your Rasengan!

01:20:30.701 --> 01:20:32.495
Can I really...?

01:20:33.037 --> 01:20:34.413
Trust your master.

01:20:35.081 --> 01:20:37.500
That's why
I brought you here with me.

01:20:44.382 --> 01:20:45.550
Rasengan?!

01:20:50.471 --> 01:20:51.973
Go!

01:21:16.747 --> 01:21:17.790
What?!

01:21:17.832 --> 01:21:19.250
What just happened?

01:21:22.420 --> 01:21:24.463
What is the meaning of this?

01:21:26.382 --> 01:21:27.967
When did you learn the Rasengan?!

01:21:28.509 --> 01:21:30.720
Do you know how hard
it is to perfect?

01:21:32.179 --> 01:21:34.640
But this Rasengan adds
a sudden Change in Chakra Nature,

01:21:34.724 --> 01:21:36.267
then disappears.

01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:43.316
I see!

01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:45.568
Boruto, do it again.

01:21:46.277 --> 01:21:48.029
But my Rasengan's...

01:21:48.321 --> 01:21:50.823
Just do as Sasuke says...

01:21:51.616 --> 01:21:52.992
O-Okay!

01:21:54.410 --> 01:21:56.829
You dare to soil my garments twice...

01:22:46.545 --> 01:22:50.091
<i>What did he have to go through...
to get to this point... ?</i>

01:23:03.813 --> 01:23:05.606
I don't feel like losing...

01:23:09.694 --> 01:23:12.738
I can make
an endless number of those!

01:23:15.074 --> 01:23:17.827
We've got only one chance.
Got it?

01:23:18.786 --> 01:23:19.620
Let's go!

01:23:19.704 --> 01:23:20.579
Right!

01:23:34.885 --> 01:23:36.220
There's no second chance.

01:23:39.765 --> 01:23:41.642
The rest is up to you...

01:23:41.726 --> 01:23:42.643
Boruto!

01:23:47.898 --> 01:23:49.275
Why you-!

01:23:50.192 --> 01:23:51.694
What have you done?!

01:24:02.038 --> 01:24:03.706
Go, Boruto.

01:24:03.914 --> 01:24:05.499
Rasengan!

01:24:59.095 --> 01:25:00.262
You're a wreck.

01:25:00.805 --> 01:25:02.139
So are you...

01:25:02.306 --> 01:25:04.767
Yeah... I can barely stand.

01:25:08.646 --> 01:25:10.856
I won this contest.

01:25:13.484 --> 01:25:15.361
The soul of a shinobi
remains the same...

01:25:17.196 --> 01:25:18.906
Even for your kid.

01:25:26.497 --> 01:25:27.706
<i>Boruto...</i>

01:25:29.250 --> 01:25:30.751
<i>You're right.</i>

01:25:30.835 --> 01:25:33.295
<i>The situation's different from
the time my dad was the Fourth...</i>

01:25:33.921 --> 01:25:36.465
<i>I'm the Hokage who's present,
right now.</i>

01:25:37.007 --> 01:25:40.678
<i>And I'll be here
to watch over you...</i>

01:25:41.262 --> 01:25:43.055
<i>as you grow up.</i>

01:26:01.198 --> 01:26:02.992
It's okay, Mom...
You can leave it.

01:26:05.035 --> 01:26:06.245
It looks cool like that.

01:26:08.706 --> 01:26:09.748
CONTINUE
GAME OVER

01:26:09.874 --> 01:26:11.125
BORUTO LEVEL ONE

01:26:13.377 --> 01:26:14.587
Mom, my jacket.

01:26:19.717 --> 01:26:21.093
I have to go now.

01:26:24.054 --> 01:26:25.848
How are you doing on time, Dad?

01:26:27.391 --> 01:26:28.851
Oh, yeah.

01:26:29.518 --> 01:26:30.769
Papa, your lunch!

01:26:30.853 --> 01:26:32.479
Oops.

01:26:32.771 --> 01:26:34.231
Thank you, Himawari

01:26:35.691 --> 01:26:37.443
Oh no, Boruto forgot too.

01:26:40.279 --> 01:26:41.572
I'm off!

01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:42.865
I'll be going now!

01:26:42.907 --> 01:26:44.742
- Have a good day.
- Have a good day.

01:26:46.744 --> 01:26:48.746
Boruto, are you off on a mission?

01:26:49.079 --> 01:26:51.832
Yeah. Do your best at work, Dad!

01:26:52.249 --> 01:26:52.917
Got it!

01:27:08.599 --> 01:27:11.435
<i>What's important is to study hard
and learn, you know?</i>

01:27:11.435 --> 01:27:13.520
<i>So although you're still a genin,</i>

01:27:13.604 --> 01:27:16.273
<i>that's how you fought
alongside the Five Kage</i>

01:27:16.315 --> 01:27:18.317
<i>and helped save us from danger?</i>

01:27:20.402 --> 01:27:23.781
<i>What's the most important thing
for a shinobi?</i>

01:27:24.323 --> 01:27:25.950
<i>Teamwork and perseverance!</i>

01:27:25.991 --> 01:27:27.826
<i>Oh, how wonderful!</i>

01:27:28.619 --> 01:27:29.954
<i>My dad said...</i>

01:27:29.995 --> 01:27:31.830
<i>It's not up here that counts...</i>

01:27:31.872 --> 01:27:34.250
<i>It's what you know and feel here.</i>

01:27:34.541 --> 01:27:35.668
<i>I see.</i>

01:27:36.168 --> 01:27:37.836
<i>Finally, any thoughts
on the resumption</i>

01:27:37.878 --> 01:27:39.421
<i>of the Chunin Selection Exams?</i>

01:27:39.797 --> 01:27:41.715
<i>I'm gonna make it this time,
you know!</i>

01:27:44.134 --> 01:27:46.387
<i>This has been a live broadcast.</i>

01:27:47.846 --> 01:27:49.181
A Shadow Clone?

01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:51.725
I hope you're the real one.

01:27:51.809 --> 01:27:53.018
Of course!

01:27:53.811 --> 01:27:56.647
You've been busy with all
those television interviews.

01:27:57.022 --> 01:27:58.190
Even though you cheated.

01:27:58.691 --> 01:28:01.777
How many times have I
apologized for that?

01:28:01.819 --> 01:28:03.028
Give me a break already!

01:28:10.828 --> 01:28:13.038
<i>A panda's escaped from the zoo!</i>

01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:14.790
<i>No, that's a bear!</i>

01:28:15.541 --> 01:28:17.001
<i>Anyway, it's headed your way.</i>

01:28:17.584 --> 01:28:18.377
Roger that!

01:28:18.836 --> 01:28:20.212
Not again. . .eh?

01:28:20.587 --> 01:28:23.340
I'll be the decoy,
so you guys capture it.

01:28:23.882 --> 01:28:24.883
- Roger!
- Right!

01:28:26.802 --> 01:28:29.221
Do it right this time, you two.

01:28:30.139 --> 01:28:32.891
Boruto, you're the son of
the Seventh Hokage

01:28:32.933 --> 01:28:33.892
and the grandson
of the Fourth Hokage-

01:28:33.976 --> 01:28:35.185
Hey, Boruto...

01:28:38.022 --> 01:28:40.065
Deep down inside, don't you want
to become the Hokage too?

01:28:42.693 --> 01:28:44.069
Me, the Hokage?

01:28:46.071 --> 01:28:47.156
I don't want to!

01:28:48.073 --> 01:28:51.076
But. . .when you become
the Hokage,

01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:52.786
I'll be your right-hand man.

01:28:53.454 --> 01:28:54.788
I'll guard you well!

01:28:57.458 --> 01:29:00.044
To me,
the Hokage is just a path.

01:29:00.461 --> 01:29:02.921
Just because my grandpa
and dad are Hokage

01:29:02.963 --> 01:29:05.132
doesn't mean I have to walk
the same path.

01:29:06.342 --> 01:29:07.343
Sarada...

01:29:08.010 --> 01:29:09.678
What I'm really aiming for

01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:11.930
is to become a shinobi
like your dad.

01:29:15.642 --> 01:29:17.770
I'm going to follow
my own Ninja Way!

01:29:33.494 --> 01:29:34.787
All right, here it comes.

01:29:35.037 --> 01:29:36.789
Let's do this, Boruto! Mitsuki!

01:29:36.872 --> 01:29:37.498
- Right!
- Okay!

01:29:50.719 --> 01:29:57.559
<i>At any time, even now,
we'll achieve our goal</i>

01:29:57.601 --> 01:30:02.689
<i>Even now, we fly off on our way</i>

01:30:23.085 --> 01:30:28.674
<i>When the sun rises once again,
I'll take a step forward</i>

01:30:29.967 --> 01:30:36.515
<i>I'm supposed to be different
from yesterday</i>

01:30:36.765 --> 01:30:42.312
<i>I wonder why they don't notice?</i>

01:30:43.647 --> 01:30:49.778
<i>Dissatisfaction grows in my heart</i>

01:30:49.820 --> 01:30:53.115
<i>There are so many things
I've never seen,</i>

01:30:53.157 --> 01:30:56.452
<i>So many things I've never heard</i>

01:30:56.493 --> 01:31:02.708
<i>But reflected in these blue eyes...</i>

01:31:02.749 --> 01:31:09.506
<i>At any time, even now,
that shadow running in the distance</i>

01:31:09.548 --> 01:31:16.430
<i>I'm not just waiting around either</i>

01:31:16.513 --> 01:31:23.228
<i>At any time, even now,
we'll achieve our goal</i>

01:31:23.312 --> 01:31:28.275
<i>Even now, we fly off on our way</i>

01:31:38.452 --> 01:31:43.916
<i>I stomped my feet,
wanting to be acknowledged</i>

01:31:45.375 --> 01:31:51.882
<i>Because I'm so frustrated
I can't put it into words</i>

01:31:52.216 --> 01:31:58.222
<i>The more I wish to become stronger</i>

01:31:58.263 --> 01:32:04.311
<i>The more it seems like
I'm grabbing at straws</i>

01:32:04.394 --> 01:32:11.026
<i>I act strong and keep acting like
I'm strong, like there's nothing I fear</i>

01:32:11.068 --> 01:32:18.116
<i>I laugh and pretend,
unable to say how I really feel</i>

01:32:18.158 --> 01:32:24.957
<i>Then I get tired of it and
feel irritated and useless</i>

01:32:24.998 --> 01:32:30.295
<i>And I think, "what's the point,"
and stop.</i>

01:32:44.518 --> 01:32:53.819
<i>I don't have the guts, but I hate
to lose and the tears fall again</i>

01:32:53.902 --> 01:33:01.660
<i>I'm in a whirlpool of
never ending anxiety and conflict</i>

01:33:01.702 --> 01:33:08.000
<i>And before I know it,
the sun's already set</i>

01:33:09.543 --> 01:33:16.383
<i>Come rain or wind,
I'll face it and push on</i>

01:33:16.466 --> 01:33:23.223
<i>I know I can do it,
and dive into my way</i>

01:33:23.307 --> 01:33:29.980
<i>At any time, even now,
we'll achieve our goal</i>

01:33:30.022 --> 01:33:36.945
<i>Can you see me,
flying off on my way?</i>

01:33:36.987 --> 01:33:43.952
<i>Even if it got filthy and torn,
it was something I wanted</i>

01:33:43.994 --> 01:33:49.958
<i>And now, it's right here.</i>

01:34:21.531 --> 01:34:23.033
Like I said, it's a bear!

01:34:23.075 --> 01:34:24.785
Ugh! Shut up, shut up!
I'm saying it's a panda!

01:34:24.868 --> 01:34:25.994
- It's a bear, a bear!
- Panda!

01:34:26.036 --> 01:34:26.745
Bear!

01:34:26.828 --> 01:34:28.747
- You guys sure get along well.
- Panda! - Bear!

01:34:30.582 --> 01:34:34.086
It would be nice if you could show
my parent some respect too.

01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:37.089
Oh yeah, speaking of which...

01:34:37.756 --> 01:34:38.882
Who is it?

01:34:39.216 --> 01:34:41.259
Huh? Didn't I tell you?

01:34:44.012 --> 01:34:45.972
He's called Orochimaru.

01:34:46.973 --> 01:34:47.849
Who?

01:34:48.225 --> 01:34:52.104
You mean... You're the child of
that Orochimaru?

01:34:56.400 --> 01:35:00.445
So, is he your dad? Or your mom?

01:35:01.405 --> 01:35:04.282
Well, that doesn't really matter...

01:35:05.033 --> 01:35:07.119
So who is this Orochimaru?

01:35:07.577 --> 01:35:10.414
And what do you mean
by "that doesn't matter"?

01:35:10.455 --> 01:35:12.040
I don't get it!
