- I feel good with you too.

52:05.823 --> 52:07.358
- Um...

52:07.358 --> 52:11.428
This is a conversation
that I have to have, um...

52:11.428 --> 52:16.100
in relationships because
it's a part of who I am,

52:16.100 --> 52:17.935
it's a part of my story.

52:19.169 --> 52:22.072
It's, um, it's like,
not an easy thing

52:22.072 --> 52:23.841
for me to talk about.

52:25.109 --> 52:27.211
But it's something
that's really important,

52:27.211 --> 52:28.379
especially in relationships,

52:28.379 --> 52:32.216
because it's
something that, um...

52:32.216 --> 52:34.284
has come in between,
like, intimacy

52:34.284 --> 52:36.887
and just a lot of different
things in my life.

52:38.622 --> 52:42.426
Um...so four years ago,
I was a sophomore in college.

52:42.426 --> 52:45.262
It was actually four years ago
in October, so...

52:45.262 --> 52:46.363
2014 of October.

52:46.363 --> 52:50.367
And, um, me and three
of my girlfriends

52:50.367 --> 52:52.102
went to one
of my friends' houses,

52:52.102 --> 52:54.271
and they--they drugged
our wine.

52:54.271 --> 52:57.174
Um, I woke up
the next morning

52:57.174 --> 52:58.442
and I was completely naked
in my bed

52:58.442 --> 53:01.412
and had no memory
of the night before.

53:01.412 --> 53:05.449
And I had, like, a small vision
of a guy in my bed.

53:05.449 --> 53:08.385
And I was like--I just had
this pit in my stomach,

53:08.385 --> 53:11.155
like, something really bad
happened last night.

53:11.155 --> 53:13.223
And my girlfriend
called me and said

53:13.223 --> 53:15.492
the three of us were
all sexually assaulted.

53:15.492 --> 53:18.295
Um, her and
my other girlfriend

53:18.295 --> 53:20.631
passed out in a bed
at the party,

53:20.631 --> 53:22.499
and two men came in
and had sex with them

53:22.499 --> 53:24.234
in the same bed
at the same time

53:24.234 --> 53:26.270
while they were incapacitated.

53:26.270 --> 53:28.405
And...

53:28.405 --> 53:30.474
then the girlfriend

53:30.474 --> 53:32.576
who didn't drink the wine
called me and told me

53:32.576 --> 53:35.312
not only did a guy come home
and have sex with me,

53:35.312 --> 53:39.450
um, another guy...

53:39.450 --> 53:42.519
I was passed out on a couch
from the drugs,

53:42.519 --> 53:46.423
and he was like,
"Watch what I'm about to do,"

53:46.423 --> 53:48.759
with all his fraternity
brothers around me.

53:48.759 --> 53:51.395
And lifted up my dress,
while they watched and laughed

53:51.395 --> 53:53.697
and took photos
and Snapchats and...

53:53.697 --> 53:56.567
Um, it was horrible.
It was absolutely horrible.

53:56.567 --> 54:01.105
And I did everything
that I was supposed to do.

54:01.105 --> 54:02.372
I went to the police
the next day.

54:02.372 --> 54:04.274
I tried to get a rape kit done.

54:04.274 --> 54:07.277
I was turned away
by a hospital,

54:07.277 --> 54:08.512
which is illegal.

54:08.512 --> 54:11.381
And I went to another hospital.
They did a rape kit.

54:11.381 --> 54:12.549
Um, the results
were inconclusive,

54:12.549 --> 54:14.218
because so much time
had passed

54:14.218 --> 54:16.653
because the first hospital
turned me away.

54:16.653 --> 54:20.157
And the men got away with it,
except for one.

54:20.157 --> 54:21.558
One of them did get expelled.

54:21.558 --> 54:24.094
The rest of them
got away with it.

54:28.098 --> 54:29.266
- I can't even imagine,

54:29.266 --> 54:31.835
like, going through
something like that.

54:33.370 --> 54:36.874
And I know, like,
talking about it's not easy.

54:39.510 --> 54:42.246
And like, the--the fact that,
like, that happened

54:42.246 --> 54:45.149
to you is devastating.

54:48.385 --> 54:50.654
- We all handled it
very differently.

54:50.654 --> 54:55.526
I was determined to get justice
and seek justice.

54:55.526 --> 54:57.394
And it's--it's like,
it's something

54:57.394 --> 54:59.396
that will always
be a part of me

54:59.396 --> 55:00.564
and will always come up
in relationships,

55:00.564 --> 55:02.599
and that's why I wanted
to bring it up to you,

55:02.599 --> 55:06.203
because, like, I did--
I struggled with

55:06.203 --> 55:09.039
the shame and guilt
that I had felt.

55:09.039 --> 55:09.706
- Yeah.

55:09.706 --> 55:12.309
- It's the most difficult
thing in the world.

55:12.309 --> 55:17.114
It is so painful,
and it's--and it screws up

55:17.114 --> 55:18.282
every ounce of you.

55:18.282 --> 55:21.351
Like, I mean, it--it took
months for people--like,

55:21.351 --> 55:22.486
men would like,
touch my shoulder

55:22.486 --> 55:24.221
or graze my shoulder
or bump--like,

55:24.221 --> 55:25.389
and I was triggered.

55:25.389 --> 55:27.858
And I couldn't--it was awful.

55:27.858 --> 55:31.295
I had to take all of my--like,
I couldn't leave my house.

55:31.295 --> 55:33.463
It was so, so bad.

55:33.463 --> 55:35.632
- Who helped you get through

55:35.632 --> 55:37.968
everything that you
went through?

55:37.968 --> 55:40.370
- Mm.

55:40.370 --> 55:42.306
I like--I wasn't able to
open up about it

55:42.306 --> 55:43.440
for a long time.

55:43.440 --> 55:45.475
I didn't tell my parents,
because I felt so ashamed

55:45.475 --> 55:48.212
and so guilty.

55:48.212 --> 55:51.481
And she found out one day.

55:51.481 --> 55:53.884
- Your mom?
- Yeah.

55:55.385 --> 55:56.787
And I told her everything.

55:56.787 --> 55:59.489
The next day she went
and met with the dean,

55:59.489 --> 56:02.726
and then she met with
my attorney,

56:02.726 --> 56:06.763
um, and she started
fighting immediately.

56:06.763 --> 56:08.599
And I don't know why I hid it
from her for so long.

56:08.599 --> 56:10.934
I hid it from her
for almost a year.

56:12.569 --> 56:14.304
I don't know, it's been--
it's been hard,

56:14.304 --> 56:16.306
but, like, it shaped me
as a person,

56:16.306 --> 56:17.441
and it's made me so strong

56:17.441 --> 56:19.776
and like, made me the person
that I am today.

56:19.776 --> 56:23.146
And I--and I like to be happy
and goofy and fun,

56:23.146 --> 56:25.582
but it's like...
- Yeah.

56:25.582 --> 56:26.917
- It's like a dark part
of my history,

56:26.917 --> 56:30.287
but I'm not gonna let that,
like, diminish me or who I am.

56:32.623 --> 56:35.659
- I want you to know, like,
with me, you're safe.

56:35.659 --> 56:38.262
- I do feel that.
- Good.

56:38.262 --> 56:41.431
- I feel so safe with you.

56:41.431 --> 56:45.269
Like, I've never felt this way
in a relationship,

56:45.269 --> 56:46.470
so safe and so comfortable.

56:46.470 --> 56:48.171
- Yeah.

56:48.171 --> 56:51.108
- I really appreciate...

56:51.108 --> 56:51.708
taking this so well,

56:51.708 --> 56:53.777
'cause that's a fear
in relationships.

56:53.777 --> 56:57.581
It's like--a lot of people
don't know how to handle it,

56:57.581 --> 57:01.485
and a lot of people clam up
and tense up and freak out.

57:01.485 --> 57:02.486
- Yeah.

57:02.486 --> 57:04.454
- And...

57:04.454 --> 57:05.589
And you haven't.

57:05.589 --> 57:09.259
And I really appreciate just...

57:09.259 --> 57:11.094
I really appreciate you.

57:12.329 --> 57:13.964
- Come here.

57:29.379 --> 57:33.951
I have had a situation
in my past where...

57:35.619 --> 57:37.254
I was in a relationship...

57:37.254 --> 57:38.322
- Mm-hmm.

57:38.322 --> 57:40.357
- In which
she was sexually abused.

57:44.361 --> 57:46.997
And...

57:49.433 --> 57:51.301
And for me,
that was the hardest thing

57:51.301 --> 57:53.603
I ever had to watch.

57:53.603 --> 57:57.574
Going through something
with someone,

57:57.574 --> 58:02.145
looking into her eyes
and just knowing, like...

58:03.513 --> 58:05.549
the pain associated with it.

58:05.549 --> 58:08.151
- Yeah.

58:08.151 --> 58:10.954
- And...

58:10.954 --> 58:15.625
Like, who am I to feel the pain
when I wasn't the victim?

58:15.625 --> 58:17.594
- I don't think
that's true, though,

58:17.594 --> 58:20.197
because I've seen...

58:21.732 --> 58:25.669
like, how it's--how it's
affected my family,

58:25.669 --> 58:28.605
affected my--it's affected
every single person in my life.

58:28.605 --> 58:30.640
Like, it's not just something
that I've been through.

58:30.640 --> 58:33.310
It's something that
everyone in my life

58:33.310 --> 58:34.478
went through with me.

58:34.478 --> 58:36.046
- Yeah.

58:36.046 --> 58:40.617
I think that that's one thing
people will never understand

58:40.617 --> 58:45.522
is like, the intimacy
that goes along

58:45.522 --> 58:47.557
with what you've experienced.
- Mm-hmm.

58:47.557 --> 58:49.426
- And I've been on
the other side of it.

58:49.426 --> 58:50.727
- Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

58:50.727 --> 58:54.564
- And for me,
for that to be my...

58:54.564 --> 58:56.666
my first love,
and like, the first person

58:56.666 --> 58:59.369
who like, I found,
like, for me.

58:59.369 --> 59:00.470
- Mm-hmm.

59:00.470 --> 59:02.606
- And it didn't happen.

59:02.606 --> 59:06.343
And opening up last year
about my virginity

59:06.343 --> 59:08.178
wasn't the easiest thing to do.

59:08.178 --> 59:09.413
- Right.

59:10.714 --> 59:12.382
- But I think, like,
the thing I realized

59:12.382 --> 59:13.550
is everybody who asked me
is like,

59:13.550 --> 59:14.651
"Why are you a virgin?"

59:14.651 --> 59:15.685
- Mm-hmm.

59:15.685 --> 59:17.487
- They expect
this simple answer.

59:17.487 --> 59:18.588
- Mm-hmm.
- They want a reason.

59:18.588 --> 59:20.624
- Yeah.

59:20.624 --> 59:23.093
- And my reason's complicated.

to open up to me too.

59:31.535 --> 59:33.737

59:33.737 --> 59:35.739
- You know, I think that's...

59:35.739 --> 59:40.444
maybe why I feel so safe
with you.

59:40.444 --> 59:42.446

right?

1:02:28.612 --> 1:02:29.846
all: Yes.

1:02:29.846 --> 1:02:31.147
- It just gives me so much
hope that at the end of this,

1:02:31.147 --> 1:02:35.685
I'm gonna be the happiest
and luckiest man on the planet.

1:02:35.685 --> 1:02:38.655
So to all of you
incredible ladies

1:02:38.655 --> 1:02:40.523
and to finding love.

1:02:40.523 --> 1:02:41.524
So cheers.

1:02:41.524 --> 1:02:42.993
all: Cheers.
- Yes.

1:02:42.993 --> 1:02:45.829
- I feel good about
where Colton and I stand.

1:02:45.829 --> 1:02:47.764
<i>I feel excited and hopeful</i>

1:02:47.764 --> 1:02:50.700
and I just want to hang out
with him more.

1:02:50.700 --> 1:02:51.935
Is this your place, seriously?

1:02:51.935 --> 1:02:53.937
- This is my room.
- Look at you.

1:02:53.937 --> 1:02:57.007
<i>There's definitely</i>
<i>some sparks flying</i>

1:02:57.007 --> 1:02:58.975
<i>and chemistry between</i>
<i>Colton and I,</i>

1:02:58.975 --> 1:03:03.947
<i>but I'm terrified to just put</i>
<i>everything out on the line</i>

1:03:03.947 --> 1:03:06.916
<i>and really, really wear</i>
<i>my heart on my sleeve.</i>

1:03:06.916 --> 1:03:10.053
But it is important if I want

1:03:10.053 --> 1:03:12.589
this relationship to keep
going forward.

1:03:12.589 --> 1:03:14.724
It means a lot that, like,

1:03:14.724 --> 1:03:16.760
even though your bed
is perfectly made,

1:03:16.760 --> 1:03:18.795
I don't know if that's
your thing, but like--

1:03:18.795 --> 1:03:19.863
- I have a little OCD in me.

1:03:19.863 --> 1:03:21.865
- I kinda do too.
I kinda do too, I get it.

1:03:21.865 --> 1:03:25.835
But it means a lot that you
brought me here.

1:03:25.835 --> 1:03:28.938
I do want us to, like,

1:03:28.938 --> 1:03:31.608
move forward.

1:03:31.608 --> 1:03:32.776
- Yeah.

1:03:32.776 --> 1:03:34.778
- So I'm going to try
really hard

1:03:34.778 --> 1:03:38.748
to open up,
even though it's scary for me.

1:03:38.748 --> 1:03:41.818
- Okay.
- And, um...

1:03:41.818 --> 1:03:44.087
it's--I'm not gonna be
great at words,

1:03:44.087 --> 1:03:46.122
and I'm not gonna be great
at saying what I need to say,

1:03:46.122 --> 1:03:50.760
because I am, like,
comfortable around you,

1:03:50.760 --> 1:03:52.162
but it also makes me nervous
to open up

1:03:52.162 --> 1:03:54.064
about those things, so...
- Yeah.

1:03:54.064 --> 1:03:55.899
I do want to get
to know you more.

1:03:55.899 --> 1:03:57.033
- Yeah.

1:03:57.033 --> 1:03:58.968
- 'Cause like, for me,
it's like, in a way,

1:03:58.968 --> 1:04:00.203
like, I was like,
"Man, I'm frustrated,

1:04:00.203 --> 1:04:02.839
because I really like
Hannah G. so much"...

1:04:02.839 --> 1:04:03.907
- Mm-hmm.

1:04:03.907 --> 1:04:05.742
- "And I don't know a ton
about her."

1:04:05.742 --> 1:04:06.943
- Yeah.

1:04:06.943 --> 1:04:08.845

the way you make me feel.

1:05:56.853 --> 1:05:57.954
- I think this
is the first time

1:05:57.954 --> 1:05:59.088
they've actually talked
to each other

1:05:59.088 --> 1:06:01.858
and not to him,
not to us about it.

1:06:01.858 --> 1:06:04.260
- Exactly, exactly, exactly.

1:06:04.260 --> 1:06:05.995
They have been avoiding
each other

1:06:05.995 --> 1:06:07.630

1:06:09.899 --> 1:06:10.967

- Okay.

1:06:14.237 --> 1:06:17.173
I just want to say
there's been tension.

1:06:17.173 --> 1:06:19.142
There's been
unnecessary drama.

1:06:19.142 --> 1:06:22.145

both kinda been putting it off,

like, we don't wanna
address it.

1:06:23.246 --> 1:06:26.249

1:06:26.249 --> 1:06:28.084

1:06:28.084 --> 1:06:29.919
- Yeah.

1:06:29.919 --> 1:06:31.321
- It has been uncomfortable.

1:06:31.321 --> 1:06:35.258
We used to be good friends
and then we had a tiff,

1:06:35.258 --> 1:06:39.829
and I think it's okay for us
to be a little upset.

1:06:39.829 --> 1:06:42.031
There is no getting around it.

1:06:42.031 --> 1:06:44.300
- But it's hard enough as women

1:06:44.300 --> 1:06:47.971
and hard enough as we've both
been through such tough things,

1:06:47.971 --> 1:06:49.939
so I think my thing is,

1:06:49.939 --> 1:06:51.975
why not be supportive
of one another?

1:06:51.975 --> 1:06:54.010
Let's put the past
in the past.

1:06:54.010 --> 1:06:55.178
Let's squash this
once and for all.

1:06:55.178 --> 1:06:56.479
Let's just, like, it's done.

1:06:56.479 --> 1:06:59.883
I'm not necessarily saying
we're gonna be best friends...

1:06:59.883 --> 1:07:01.184
- I want to enjoy my time,

1:07:01.184 --> 1:07:04.153
and I feel like
this has not made it as...

1:07:04.153 --> 1:07:05.321
- As enjoyable as it should be.

1:07:05.321 --> 1:07:07.257
- Yeah, and it's been--
it's been frustrating,

1:07:07.257 --> 1:07:09.559
because I had
to deal last week

1:07:09.559 --> 1:07:12.662
with stuff that I didn't ever
wanna have to talk about.

1:07:13.997 --> 1:07:18.034
But...I--I'm also aware that

1:07:18.034 --> 1:07:19.402
I think Colton has a relat--
connection with you,

1:07:19.402 --> 1:07:21.404
and I know he has
a connection with me.

1:07:21.404 --> 1:07:24.240
We're gonna hopefully be here.
- Yeah.

1:07:24.240 --> 1:07:26.943
- And I don't, like, think
you're a horrible person.

1:07:26.943 --> 1:07:28.177
- No, I--I keep saying that.

1:07:28.177 --> 1:07:30.813
I'm like, I--I don't wish
anything bad upon you ever.

1:07:30.813 --> 1:07:31.447
- Yeah.

1:07:31.447 --> 1:07:33.216
- Truly, truly, truly, Hannah.
Like, truly.

1:07:33.216 --> 1:07:36.185
- You know,
whatever has been said

1:07:36.185 --> 1:07:38.955
and taken differently
than it was supposed to,

1:07:38.955 --> 1:07:39.956
I'm sorry for that.

1:07:39.956 --> 1:07:40.990
- No, I apologize too.

1:07:40.990 --> 1:07:41.991
- So...
- Yeah.

1:07:41.991 --> 1:07:43.026
- Yeah, I think it's good.

1:07:43.026 --> 1:07:44.060
- Me too.
- I feel better.

1:07:44.060 --> 1:07:45.862
- Me too,
I feel so much better.

1:07:45.862 --> 1:07:47.363
<i>- I do accept her apology.</i>

1:07:47.363 --> 1:07:48.565
We don't have to be
best friends

1:07:48.565 --> 1:07:51.901
and not necessarily that
that's what we're trying to do,

1:07:51.901 --> 1:07:56.039
<i>but at least it's just done,</i>

1:07:56.039 --> 1:07:59.309
and World War III
was averted tonight.

1:07:59.309 --> 1:08:02.045
Let's go back in there
and shake these girls up.

1:08:02.045 --> 1:08:04.013

1:08:06.082 --> 1:08:07.350

- Yeah.

1:08:11.854 --> 1:08:13.122
- Bomb! Here we go.

1:08:13.122 --> 1:08:14.357

1:08:14.357 --> 1:08:17.060
You insinuated that
I had no class.

1:08:17.060 --> 1:08:18.428
- You pressed
the wrong button,

1:08:18.428 --> 1:08:20.496
and that's not a button
you want to press.

1:08:20.496 --> 1:08:23.399
<i>I'm not gonna let</i>

1:08:23.399 --> 1:08:26.803
<i>- This is my greatest</i>
<i>fear coming alive right now.</i>

1:08:29.505 --> 1:08:32.408
- Are you feeling
different from the other day?

1:08:32.408 --> 1:08:35.378
- I'm feeling better
and a lot more optimistic.

1:08:35.378 --> 1:08:38.381
I just, you know, I don't know
what's gonna happen tonight,

1:08:38.381 --> 1:08:40.416
and I hope I'm here,
and I hope that people

1:08:40.416 --> 1:08:43.152
that don't deserve
to be here...

1:08:43.152 --> 1:08:45.421
eventually
aren't here anymore.

1:08:45.421 --> 1:08:48.224
- Do you think that people
don't deserve to be here?

1:08:48.224 --> 1:08:50.159
- You know, it has
everything to do with

1:08:50.159 --> 1:08:52.028
where you are in life
and what you say

1:08:52.028 --> 1:08:53.363
and what you do
and how you act.

1:08:53.363 --> 1:08:56.232
It's not a show, it's
not like a show and tell,

1:08:56.232 --> 1:08:57.333

1:09:08.311 --> 1:09:09.445
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1:09:09.445 --> 1:09:11.381
- Just making sure.
- Yeah, no, thank you.

1:09:11.381 --> 1:09:13.383
- I know it's kinda hard,
people--you feel like--

1:09:13.383 --> 1:09:15.418
- Well, it's like, I don't
wanna be [bleep] mean to her,

1:09:15.418 --> 1:09:18.855
but I'm sort of tired
of her throwing shade.

1:09:18.855 --> 1:09:19.489
- Yeah.

1:09:19.489 --> 1:09:21.157
- I just wanna be like,
"Shut the [bleep] up."

1:09:21.157 --> 1:09:23.092
- Do you think, like,
Colton knows

1:09:23.092 --> 1:09:24.961
what went down
between you guys?

1:09:24.961 --> 1:09:26.129

Do you think she's gonna
talk to him?

1:09:27.296 --> 1:09:29.198
- You just literally
never know.

1:09:29.198 --> 1:09:30.366
- Yeah.

1:09:30.366 --> 1:09:32.368
<i>I'm one of the nicest</i>
<i>people in the world,</i>

1:09:32.368 --> 1:09:36.139

Do you mind?

1:09:37.173 --> 1:09:39.142
- Ugh, I guess you can steal
our man.

1:09:39.142 --> 1:09:40.243
- Maybe it's time for us

1:09:40.243 --> 1:09:42.311
to start being
a little more honest.

1:09:42.311 --> 1:09:44.280
Um, I don't wanna
talk about this long,

1:09:44.280 --> 1:09:46.082
'cause I wanna get into
the--you know,

1:09:46.082 --> 1:09:48.017
whatever else I wanna

1:09:48.017 --> 1:09:50.253
But, uh, Courtney...

1:09:50.253 --> 1:09:54.257
She is like the cancer
of the house.

1:09:54.257 --> 1:09:55.525
She, like, attacked me.

1:09:55.525 --> 1:09:57.627
Uh, she told me I was,
like, playing God

1:09:57.627 --> 1:10:00.430
because I talked to you again
that night,

1:10:00.430 --> 1:10:02.398
and I just wanted
to tell you, like...

1:10:02.398 --> 1:10:03.533
- She--she attacked you?

1:10:03.533 --> 1:10:06.135
- Yeah, but I mean,
it didn't really faze me.

1:10:06.135 --> 1:10:07.336
But I did wanna tell you,

1:10:07.336 --> 1:10:09.238

1:12:00.183 --> 1:12:02.652
the words "attack"

"the cancer of the house"

1:12:06.489 --> 1:12:08.524

enemy in the world

1:12:15.264 --> 1:12:16.499

1:12:16.499 --> 1:12:19.535
I think every single person
in the house,

1:12:19.535 --> 1:12:22.305
especially myself,
can agree that

1:12:22.305 --> 1:12:24.407
if anyone isn't here
for the right reasons,

1:12:24.407 --> 1:12:26.509
it is Demi.

1:12:26.509 --> 1:12:28.544

she said,

1:12:28.544 --> 1:12:32.315
"Well, I wish I could say
I was doing good, but..."

1:12:32.315 --> 1:12:34.584

most of the time,

1:12:43.559 --> 1:12:45.361

1:12:45.361 --> 1:12:46.562

1:12:46.562 --> 1:12:48.497

feel like crap.

1:12:48.497 --> 1:12:50.466

she's the cancer.

1:12:52.268 --> 1:12:53.302
She just told me
the whole house

1:12:54.403 --> 1:12:55.738

from the truth.

She isn't here for you.

1:12:59.242 --> 1:13:00.543
You could be anybody.

The fact that
you're the bachelor,

my greatest fear is someone
that's here to win.

1:13:13.689 --> 1:13:16.425

is that, "This is a game.

the right way."

1:13:18.327 --> 1:13:20.196

I'm being mean,

insecurities.
