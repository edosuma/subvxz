WEBVTT

00:05.800 --> 00:08.098
MAN:
Hey, you shoot
when I say you can sh...

00:11.340 --> 00:12.807
(sighs)

00:12.840 --> 00:14.535
MAN (French accent):
What is your name?

00:14.580 --> 00:16.070
Riclq Packer.

00:16.110 --> 00:17.247
29 days.

00:17.280 --> 00:19.145
Ah, c-could you
include the question

00:19.180 --> 00:20.112
in the answer,
you know?

00:20.150 --> 00:21.117
Yeah, yeah.

00:21.150 --> 00:23.118
Uh, my name is Ricky Packer.

00:23.150 --> 00:25.141
And I have 29 days left to live.

00:28.590 --> 00:30.751
Been reading a lot
of the Bible-- Job.

00:30.790 --> 00:33.258
"When I lie down, I think,
how long before I get up?"

00:33.300 --> 00:36.599
Yes, Camus says, "Fate is not
in man, but around him."

00:38.600 --> 00:40.295
What is your crime,
please?

00:40.340 --> 00:42.160
Well, the State says
double homicide,

00:42.210 --> 00:44.201
but I don't even think
they believe that.

00:44.240 --> 00:46.435
They had some bodies they needed
to put on someone.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.402
You were saying before
I switched on the camera

00:48.440 --> 00:49.668
about the authorities.

00:49.710 --> 00:51.246
What is it_
you were saying?

00:51.280 --> 00:52.440
Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:52.480 --> 00:55.142
I told the guards about this
murder that I heard about--

00:55.180 --> 00:57.182
Almighty Vice Lords payback
on 19th.

00:57.220 --> 00:59.313
There's a dead body buried
up there in Douglas Park.

00:59.360 --> 01:00.315
You think they care?

01:00.360 --> 01:01.657
No. Why don't
they care?

01:01.690 --> 01:03.829
It means more work.

01:03.860 --> 01:07.250
They go dig up some gangbanger's
body, what are they gonna do?

01:07.300 --> 01:08.198
Huh?

01:08.230 --> 01:10.721
They gonna go find the killer?

01:10.770 --> 01:12.761
*

01:19.710 --> 01:21.632
You got here fast.

01:21.680 --> 01:23.238
Yeah, it's
called driving.

01:23.280 --> 01:25.805
What'd you do, stop
for hamburgers?

01:25.850 --> 01:28.375
So, what is it,
gang-related?

01:28.420 --> 01:30.217
Yep. His tip
was accurate.

01:30.250 --> 01:32.559
A tip from death row--
go figure.

01:32.590 --> 01:34.888
John Doe buried six months.

01:34.920 --> 01:37.229
One other thing, Mr.
Deputy State's Attorney.

01:37.260 --> 01:38.750
Yeah?

01:38.790 --> 01:42.362
You missed a button.

01:42.400 --> 01:43.662
Thank you, ASA Lodge.

01:43.700 --> 01:45.361
Mm-hmm.

01:45.400 --> 01:46.537
Do we know his colors?

01:46.570 --> 01:48.265
22nd Disciple.

01:48.300 --> 01:50.200
An Almighty Vice
Lords reprisal?
Well, that's the thinking.

01:50.240 --> 01:51.764
But oddly enough, that's
not why you're here.

01:51.810 --> 01:53.801
They dug up
someone else.

01:56.910 --> 01:58.878
_ A citizen?
WIth very expenswe taste.

01:58.910 --> 02:00.775
Ed says those are

02:00.820 --> 02:01.912
Christian Louboutin shoes.

02:01.950 --> 02:03.212
Ed knows that?

02:03.250 --> 02:05.411
The purse still had
$300 cash in it.

02:05.450 --> 02:07.884
Name on the_driver's license
was Adrianne Iver.

02:07.920 --> 02:11.219
A missing person
for six months now.

02:11.260 --> 02:13.228
And guess what else
we found in her purse.

02:13.260 --> 02:15.751
Her boyfriend's number.

02:18.500 --> 02:19.797
How long?

02:22.270 --> 02:23.237
So what do I do?

02:23.270 --> 02:24.407
ALICIA:
Just what they ask.

02:24.440 --> 02:27.432
You will be processed,
photographed and fingerprinted.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.243
They will take away
all your clothes

02:29.280 --> 02:31.339
and supply you with a Department
of Corrections jumpsuit.

02:31.380 --> 02:33.473
Our hope is
you'll get bail.

02:33.520 --> 02:34.748
You have ties_ to
the community,

02:34.780 --> 02:36.418
and the evidence
IS Circumstantial.

02:36.450 --> 02:38.213
MAN:
I loved her.

02:38.250 --> 02:42.220
I mean, we argued,
but I loved her.

02:42.260 --> 02:44.319
I-I didn't report her missing

02:44.360 --> 02:46.225
because Adrianne said
she was going back to Canada.

02:46.260 --> 02:47.420
ELI:
Alicia.

02:48.300 --> 02:49.324
It's important.

02:49.370 --> 02:50.792
DIANE:
Okay, the key thing here

02:50.830 --> 02:53.663
is to let us do our job.

02:53.700 --> 02:55.361
What's that about?

02:55.400 --> 02:57.265
He's being charged with
murdering his girlfriend.

02:57.310 --> 02:58.436
What's important?

02:58.470 --> 03:01.439
My computer's
acting up again.

03:02.650 --> 03:04.242
Yeah, I know that doesn't

03:04.280 --> 03:05.577
quite sound as important.

03:05.610 --> 03:07.419
Really?

03:07.450 --> 03:08.872
I need you in this
meeting, too.

03:12.620 --> 03:14.656
Okay, I have a meeting.
You got to go.

03:14.690 --> 03:16.351
You should've told Mom no.

03:16.390 --> 03:17.618
I did tell her no.

03:17.660 --> 03:19.252
That's not what she said.

03:19.300 --> 03:20.653
She said you vetted her
and everything was

03:20.700 --> 03:22.292
all right for her to run.
Why is it that

03:22.330 --> 03:23.126
every other kid in the universe

03:23.170 --> 03:24.319
knows about computers
except you?

03:24.370 --> 03:25.997
Your mom's a
polltICIan now.

03:26.030 --> 03:27.292
She's adapting
the truth

03:27.340 --> 03:28.136
for her needs.

03:28.170 --> 03:29.660
You know who gets hurt
in all this?

03:29.710 --> 03:31.007
The children.
They'll talk about

03:31.040 --> 03:33.429
your divorce and how I'm
the product of a broken home.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.277
And how I'm dating a Communist.

03:35.310 --> 03:36.004
Bob's a Communist?

03:36.040 --> 03:37.302
Ben.

03:37.350 --> 03:38.476
And I broke up with him.

03:38.510 --> 03:39.818
This is a new one. Hal.

03:39.850 --> 03:41.738
Do you date anyone with
more than one syllable?

03:41.780 --> 03:43.316
It makes our conversations
very confusmg.

03:43.350 --> 03:44.339
Didn't I say

03:44.390 --> 03:45.414
I had a meeting?

03:45.450 --> 03:47.315
Tell Mom not to run.
You tell her.

03:47.360 --> 03:48.588
She'll listen to you.
I'm not the one...

03:48.620 --> 03:49.985
Hey, old man, how you doing?

03:50.030 --> 03:51.782
So, I got to head off

03:51.830 --> 03:53.593
to meet the candidate.

03:53.630 --> 03:54.699
Where are we?

03:54.730 --> 03:56.266
A hiccup.

03:56.300 --> 03:57.460
Actually, more
than a hiccup.

03:57.500 --> 03:58.922
You said he was clean, Eli.

03:58.970 --> 04:00.790
I want to run _him
for lower office

04:00.840 --> 04:02.330
and gear up
for the 2016 presidential.

04:02.370 --> 04:03.337
He was.

04:03.370 --> 04:04.962
Financials are healthy,

04:05.010 --> 04:07.433
no affairs, good to his kids.

04:07.480 --> 04:08.708
Wow, you're bringing in
Saint Alicia.

04:08.740 --> 04:09.809
This must be serious.

04:09.850 --> 04:10.942
More than serious.

04:10.980 --> 04:13.471
We're dealing with
the ridicule factor.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.044
Is that a picture?

04:15.080 --> 04:16.889
Mm-hmm.

04:21.360 --> 04:23.521
(laughs)

04:23.560 --> 04:25.027
That's something else.

04:25.060 --> 04:26.698
(laughs)

04:26.730 --> 04:28.391
(sighs)

04:28.430 --> 04:32.298
Well, Giuliani dressed up
in women's clothes.

04:32.340 --> 04:33.739
He survived that.

04:33.770 --> 04:35.465
This is different.

04:37.570 --> 04:38.707
Okay, all right.

04:38.740 --> 04:40.071
What do you need?

04:40.110 --> 04:41.771
Bring him in. We'll talk about
how to handle it.

04:41.810 --> 04:43.573
Will she be here?

04:43.610 --> 04:45.339
Alicia. And yes, I will be

04:45.380 --> 04:46.347
in the meeting.

04:46.380 --> 04:47.449
He's got kids.

04:47.480 --> 04:49.482
He's gonna want to know
how this'll impact his kids.

04:49.520 --> 04:50.885
Understandable.
You think we can survive it?

04:50.920 --> 04:52.808
I think if
we're lucky.

04:52.860 --> 04:54.418
So what's going on here?

04:54.460 --> 04:55.916
Heard you were
under investigation.

04:55.960 --> 04:56.949
(scoffs)

04:56.990 --> 04:58.059
You heard

04:58.090 --> 04:59.421
we're under investigation?

04:59.460 --> 05:01.599
I heard the_firm's
under Investigation.

05:01.630 --> 05:04.463
Look, I don't want
to drag my candidate in here

05:04.500 --> 05:05.899
and have this firm
be under indictment.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.504
No, uh, w-we're good.

05:09.540 --> 05:12.065
We're growing and, uh,

05:12.110 --> 05:13.998
we're-we're blooming.

05:14.040 --> 05:15.371
Aren't we good?

05:15.410 --> 05:17.002
Yes. Better than ever.

05:17.050 --> 05:18.540
A rumor is often

05:18.580 --> 05:21.913
a sign of jealous
competitors.

05:33.630 --> 05:35.621
DANA:
Hello.

05:37.630 --> 05:39.097
Hi.

05:39.130 --> 05:40.529
We haven't met.

05:40.570 --> 05:41.559
ASA Dana Lodge.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.500
Kalinda Sharma.

05:43.540 --> 05:45.360
I was just trying to...

05:45.410 --> 05:46.900
Snake the Adrianne Iver
crime scene photos?

05:51.110 --> 05:52.441
Want to see?

05:52.480 --> 05:53.515
Sure.

05:53.550 --> 05:55.575
Adrianne Iver,

05:55.620 --> 05:57.087
a 28-year-old
flight attendant,

05:57.120 --> 05:58.940
quit her job after
her boyfriend proposed.

05:58.990 --> 06:00.514
Oh, wait.

06:00.560 --> 06:01.959
You represent her boyfriend,
don't you?

06:01.990 --> 06:02.957
Tom LaVere?

06:02.990 --> 06:04.480
Why, yes, we do.

06:04.530 --> 06:05.383
Ah, what a coincidence.

06:05.430 --> 06:07.591
They fought, Adrianne
tried to leave,

06:07.630 --> 06:08.528
that didn't end well.

06:08.560 --> 06:10.494
Tom shot her with his
Walther P99 handgun.

06:10.530 --> 06:11.861
Which was never recovered.

06:11.900 --> 06:13.936
Yes, so few criminals make it
easy for us these days.

06:13.970 --> 06:16.165
Mr. LaVere
buried the body

06:16.200 --> 06:18.634
in a dirt lot near Douglas
Park six months ago,

06:18.670 --> 06:20.069
far from prying eyes.

06:20.110 --> 06:23.443
And as luck would have it,
this very same lot was chosen by

06:23.480 --> 06:25.471
an Almighty Vice Lord
to bury a 22nd Disciple.

06:25.510 --> 06:28.149
So when we dug up one,
we dug up the other.

06:28.180 --> 06:29.818
So you and Cary?

06:29.850 --> 06:31.647
Me and Cary?

06:31.690 --> 06:32.782
You and Cary.

06:32.820 --> 06:35.482
I don't think
there is a me and Cary.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.056
My mistake.

06:37.090 --> 06:39.490
Hmm.

06:39.530 --> 06:42.920
Now, uh, Mr. LaVere, our client,

06:42.970 --> 06:45.120
he was worried about
Ms. Iver's safety.

06:45.170 --> 06:46.660
They were burglarized
the week prior,

06:46.700 --> 06:48.839
so he gave her his handgun
for protection.

06:48.870 --> 06:50.565
And it was the same handgun

06:50.610 --> 06:51.838
that she kept
in her glove compartment.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.132
Really?
Yeah.

06:53.180 --> 06:55.774
So here's just another
possible scenario.

06:55.810 --> 06:58.677
Ms. Iver was driving when she
came across a gangland slaying.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.519
Oh, happens all the time.

07:00.550 --> 07:02.643
She reached into the glove
compartment for the Walther P99

07:02.690 --> 07:04.817
when she was stopped by
your Almighty Vice Lord,

07:04.850 --> 07:05.942
who took the gun...

07:05.990 --> 07:07.582
And shot her with her own gun?

07:07.620 --> 07:09.520
Yeah.

07:09.560 --> 07:11.585
So, in your scenario,
what happened to her car?

07:11.630 --> 07:12.426
Gone.

07:12.460 --> 07:15.657
Taken by the killers
to a chop shop.

07:15.700 --> 07:17.668
These are two connected murders.

07:17.700 --> 07:20.237
You solve this, you'll know
who killed Adrianne Iver.

07:20.270 --> 07:22.534
Only problem:

07:22.570 --> 07:23.537
we solved this murder.

07:23.570 --> 07:24.537
A gang sweep.

07:24.570 --> 07:27.130
Maurice Johnson, aka AKA.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.671
Yeah, it makes things hard
when their akas are "AKA."

07:29.710 --> 07:30.870
Hmm.

07:30.910 --> 07:33.071
What did he do, confess?

07:33.120 --> 07:35.111
CARY:
We ask that
Mr. Johnson be tried

07:35.150 --> 07:36.981
as an adult, Your Honor.

07:37.020 --> 07:38.988
Your Honor, Maurice has
come forward on his own.

07:39.020 --> 07:41.682
He has confessed to
this homicide exactly because

07:41.720 --> 07:43.654
he wants
to remake his life.

07:43.690 --> 07:45.089
You don't believe him?

07:45.130 --> 07:46.597
I tend not to believe

07:46.630 --> 07:48.621
14-year-old lieutenants
who confess.

07:48.660 --> 07:50.662
But maybe
that's just me.

07:50.700 --> 07:53.567
Well, you bring me proof
of the opposite, I'm all ears.

07:53.600 --> 07:55.090
But we closed two murders.

07:55.140 --> 07:57.108
AKA killed
the 22nd Disciple banger.

07:57.140 --> 07:59.870
Tom LaVere killed
his girlfriend.

07:59.910 --> 08:02.708
Where do I bring the proof?

08:02.750 --> 08:03.739
Where?

08:03.780 --> 08:06.544
Yeah. Do you
have a card?

08:06.580 --> 08:07.842
Yeah. Sure, Kalinda.

08:07.880 --> 08:09.780
Here.

08:09.820 --> 08:12.584
And this is my cell.

08:12.620 --> 08:15.054
So, anytime.

08:15.090 --> 08:17.251
Thanks.

08:18.290 --> 08:20.622
(dialing)

08:20.660 --> 08:21.695
We have a problem.

08:21.730 --> 08:22.765
They think they've resolved it.

08:22.800 --> 08:23.767
DIANE:
Got it.

08:23.800 --> 08:24.721
We're with the filmmaker now.

08:24.770 --> 08:26.897
ALICIA:
So, how did the police
get involved?

08:26.940 --> 08:28.999
You see, I sent the
footage to the police.

08:29.040 --> 08:30.860
I did not think they
would pursue it.

08:30.910 --> 08:32.138
They dug up two bodies.

08:32.170 --> 08:32.977
Yes, I know.

08:33.010 --> 08:34.602
It is now part of
my documentary.

08:34.640 --> 08:35.607
Quite exciting.

08:35.640 --> 08:36.777
DIANE; _
Do you plan to interVIew

08:36.810 --> 08:37.902
Riclq Packer again?

08:37.950 --> 08:39.975
Unfortunately, they have now
limited access to death row.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.648
Did he say anything more
about this murder, Andr?

08:42.690 --> 08:44.646
Anything more
in your footage?

08:44.690 --> 08:45.941
He did. I-I showed
it to the police,

08:45.990 --> 08:47.753
but, uh, they are
uninterested now.

08:47.790 --> 08:49.052
Uh, can we see it?

08:49.090 --> 08:50.250
Of course.

08:50.290 --> 08:52.087
Well, I interviewed
Mr. Packer again,

08:52.130 --> 08:53.324
after they found the body.

08:53.360 --> 08:55.294
It is always good
to go with my assistant.

08:55.330 --> 08:56.888
He likes the pretty women.

08:56.930 --> 08:59.125
WOMAN:
You say you know who killed him?

08:59.170 --> 09:00.637
Who killed this man?

09:00.670 --> 09:01.432
RICKY:
Yeah.

09:01.470 --> 09:03.802
But why am I gonna
help the cops?

09:03.840 --> 09:05.000
ANDRE:
Why would you not?

09:05.040 --> 09:07.600
Look, man, the cops don't care
if they got the wrong one.

09:07.640 --> 09:09.642
Vice Lords are gonna do
what they always do:

09:09.680 --> 09:12.046
send up some wannabe gangster
to go do a juvie rap.

09:12.080 --> 09:14.071
Cops will be happy.

09:14.120 --> 09:15.678
(mouse clicks)

09:15.720 --> 09:17.039
ANDRE:
And that was the end.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.182
No more interviews.

09:18.220 --> 09:19.778
He didn't say who did it?

09:19.820 --> 09:20.855
DIANE:
Great.

09:20.890 --> 09:22.653
The only one
who can help our client

09:22.690 --> 09:24.885
is being executed in 36 hours.

09:42.910 --> 09:44.002
I can't do this.

09:44.050 --> 09:45.608
I can't go
back to jail.

09:45.650 --> 09:46.969
It was just the bail hearing.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.942
Tom, listen to me.
We have a lot of options.

09:48.980 --> 09:49.981
I can't last
till trial.

09:50.020 --> 09:51.385
I can't wait six months.

09:51.420 --> 09:52.717
Let's go.
Listen to me.

09:52.760 --> 09:53.988
We are not _
delaying this to trial.

09:54.020 --> 09:56.079
We're doing everything
we can, okay?

09:56.120 --> 09:58.680
Time's up.

09:58.730 --> 09:59.992
GLENDON: Is that all you have,
Mr. Coyne?

10:00.030 --> 10:01.622
That is only part

10:01.660 --> 10:02.991
of what we have,
Y-Your Honors.

10:03.030 --> 10:05.191
Mr. Packer will be executed

10:05.230 --> 10:06.834
in approximately 30
hours, and we ask

10:06.870 --> 10:08.269
that you look carefully
at the legal mistakes

10:08.300 --> 10:09.062
made by the trial judge.

10:09.100 --> 10:12.069
"Look again
at the legal mistakes"?

10:12.110 --> 10:14.738
Yes.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.645
If it pleases the court.

10:16.680 --> 10:18.648
We'll take that under
advisement.
(bangs gavel)

10:25.950 --> 10:27.156
You here to help?

10:27.190 --> 10:29.078
Well, it's a bit more
complicated than that.

10:29.120 --> 10:30.382
Try me.

10:30.430 --> 10:32.022
We need to get
to Riclq Packer

10:32.060 --> 10:32.822
before he's executed.

10:32.860 --> 10:34.896
We think he can help us
on a case.

10:34.930 --> 10:36.818
You're kidding.

10:36.870 --> 10:37.996
No, I'm afraid not.

10:38.030 --> 10:39.327
Can you get us in to him?

10:39.370 --> 10:40.894
We can't even get in to him.

10:40.940 --> 10:41.861
Unless the judges
hear our appeal,

10:41.900 --> 10:43.265
he's in 24-hour lockdown.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.335
You have another appeal
coming up?

10:45.370 --> 10:47.429
Lack of mitigation
at trial, yeah.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.277
Why?

10:49.310 --> 10:51.744
So, we have
the humanitarian appeal

10:51.780 --> 10:52.815
and not much time.

10:52.850 --> 10:55.216
Alicia, you've dealt with
Judge Glendon before.

10:55.250 --> 10:56.945
Yes. He has the swing
vote on the court.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.946
He sided with us on
another death row appeal.

10:58.990 --> 11:00.116
He had a religious conversion,

11:00.160 --> 11:01.957
so there might be
an opening there.
And my people--

11:01.990 --> 11:03.127
we're scouring
Riclq Packer's life

11:03.160 --> 11:04.422
for any shred
of humanitarian appeal...

11:04.460 --> 11:05.950
DIANE:
Right. Alicia, you work

11:05.990 --> 11:07.196
with them, and
Lockhart/Gardner,

11:07.230 --> 11:09.698
remember, we win this appeal,
we question Ricky Packer...

11:09.730 --> 11:11.163
And that helps
our client?

11:11.200 --> 11:14.033
Packer helps us find
Adrianne Iver's murderer.

11:14.070 --> 11:15.697
It's like a Rube Goldberg
defense.

11:15.740 --> 11:17.367
Well, it'll do
until we have better.

11:17.410 --> 11:19.105
So, we will work

11:19.140 --> 11:20.971
a two-pronged strategy.

11:21.010 --> 11:23.103
Kalinda, anything
you can get independently on

11:23.150 --> 11:25.072
who killed this 22nd
Disciple victim...

11:25.110 --> 11:27.112
I have access_ to the_State
Attorney's office again, so,

11:27.150 --> 11:28.879
I'll see what I can get.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.478
Good. And again,
the immediate push

11:30.520 --> 11:32.044
has to be on
this appeal.

11:32.090 --> 11:32.886
We lose Packer,

11:32.920 --> 11:35.013
we lose the key
to the real murderer.

11:35.060 --> 11:36.311
(crowd chatter)

11:38.360 --> 11:40.157
Alicia, if you
have a moment?

11:40.200 --> 11:43.067
Sure.

11:48.340 --> 11:50.331
(door closes)

11:51.910 --> 11:53.798
Sorry to make that
sound so boss-like.

11:53.840 --> 11:55.478
No. It's been hard to get away.

11:55.510 --> 11:57.000
It has.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.506
Diane's been eyeing us like

11:58.550 --> 12:00.074
we're a lawsuit
waiting to happen.

12:02.020 --> 12:04.488
It's getting a bit complicated,
isn't it?

12:04.520 --> 12:06.954
It is.

12:06.990 --> 12:09.413
Do we need to... pause?

12:09.460 --> 12:11.985
Do you want to pause?

12:14.030 --> 12:16.999
_I'm afraid even
if we say we Will,

12:17.030 --> 12:19.021
we won't.

12:19.070 --> 12:20.731
That sounds right.

12:22.200 --> 12:25.363
This is not why
I called you in here.

12:25.410 --> 12:27.139
I know.

12:27.180 --> 12:30.104
(knocking, Will sighs)

12:30.150 --> 12:32.869
It's like Grand Central
Station, isn't it?
(laughs)

12:32.920 --> 12:34.876
Go ahead.
We'll talk later.

12:36.420 --> 12:39.014
What does Peter know?

12:40.060 --> 12:42.051
About us?

12:42.090 --> 12:44.024
Uh, I-I don't
think anything,

12:44.060 --> 12:45.982
but that's never mattered
to him. Why?

12:46.030 --> 12:47.099
No reason.

12:47.130 --> 12:48.324
Did he talk to you?

12:49.360 --> 12:51.294
No.

12:54.270 --> 12:56.135
MAN:
Look, I appreciate

12:56.170 --> 12:59.059
that you guys have to do
your due diligence here, but,

12:59.110 --> 13:01.101
uh, I'm not a
ticking time bomb.

13:01.140 --> 13:02.949
I don't have an intern. (laughs)

13:02.980 --> 13:05.073
I love my wife, I love my kids.

13:05.110 --> 13:07.840
Mrs. Florrick, hello.
Robert Mulvey.

13:07.880 --> 13:09.142
How's your husband?

13:09.180 --> 13:11.080
He's very well, thank you, sir.

13:11.120 --> 13:12.485
So you're here to, uh,

13:12.520 --> 13:14.283
hand-hold me
through this scandal?

13:14.320 --> 13:16.117
ALICIA:
Anything you need.

13:16.160 --> 13:18.151
Do I need a stiff drink?

13:25.000 --> 13:26.991
(chuckling)

13:28.440 --> 13:29.964
(sighs)

13:30.010 --> 13:32.433
(laughing)

13:32.470 --> 13:33.607
You guys had me scared.

13:33.640 --> 13:35.301
Is that you, sir?
Yeah.

13:35.340 --> 13:37.877
But about ten years ago.
Winter break.

13:37.910 --> 13:39.275
You guys are joking, right?

13:39.310 --> 13:41.870
It's the ridicule factor, sir.

13:41.920 --> 13:43.148
Like Anthony Weiner.

13:43.190 --> 13:45.613
Yeah, but Anthony Weiner
took his clothes off

13:45.650 --> 13:47.959
and photographed himself
for his constituents. This is...

13:47.990 --> 13:52.154
You fellating Santa.

13:52.190 --> 13:54.226
I have to be blunt,
sir, because that's

13:54.260 --> 13:56.922
how TMZ is gonna report it,
FOX is gonna repeat it,

13:56.970 --> 13:58.562
and Jon Stewart is gonna
finish it--

13:58.600 --> 14:01.330
"Here Comes Santa."

14:01.370 --> 14:03.509
Is it possible you were
changing a lightbulb?

14:03.540 --> 14:05.405
What, between his legs?

14:05.440 --> 14:07.078
Look, it was a joke.

14:07.110 --> 14:08.202
I was a college kid.

14:08.240 --> 14:09.502
Yes, but it's a joke

14:09.540 --> 14:11.872
about you fellating Santa.

14:11.910 --> 14:14.378
And Santa's expression
does not help.

14:16.020 --> 14:17.510
What do you think?

14:17.550 --> 14:19.541
I think...

14:21.090 --> 14:23.320
You have the advantage
of releasing it yourself

14:23.360 --> 14:25.453
and taking some
of the sting away,

14:25.490 --> 14:27.151
which is why you should
take this seriously.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.895
You think we should release it?

14:28.930 --> 14:30.397
ELI: _
It's coming
out either way.

14:30.430 --> 14:32.933
The only thing you can control
is when and what it means.

14:32.970 --> 14:34.961
What it means?
You're the_Facebook
generation, Sir.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.106
Every candidate under 40
has some dumb photo

14:38.140 --> 14:40.131
from some dumb
college buddy.

14:40.180 --> 14:42.432
Krystal Ball
and the reindeer nose.

14:42.480 --> 14:44.107
Well, she lost.
Yes.

14:44.150 --> 14:47.210
But she didn't release it.
You will.

14:47.250 --> 14:49.343
My kids...

14:49.380 --> 14:51.280
my wife seeing this.

14:51.320 --> 14:53.550
Go talk to them and
make them understand.

14:54.990 --> 14:56.981
I need to think about this.

14:59.660 --> 15:02.254
Uh, one more
thing, sir.

15:02.300 --> 15:04.268
Are there any more
photos out there?

15:04.300 --> 15:05.460
Of this?
No.

15:05.500 --> 15:07.559
Of you, uh,

15:07.600 --> 15:10.205
in front of...
other statues?

15:11.340 --> 15:14.036
Funny college stunts
sometimes get repeated.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.071
Thank you, sir.
I'm sorry.

15:21.280 --> 15:24.215
Ain't ever easy, is it?

15:27.760 --> 15:29.955
So what, do you work here now?
No, they're just

15:29.990 --> 15:31.423
having trouble
with their computers.

15:31.460 --> 15:33.291
They spend, like, $85,000 on IT

15:33.330 --> 15:35.525
when I can just do it
in a few hours.

15:35.560 --> 15:36.652
Humble much?

15:36.700 --> 15:38.019
To be accurate,

15:38.070 --> 15:40.095
that was me making fun
of the law firm,

15:40.140 --> 15:41.266
not me, you know,
taking credit...

15:41.300 --> 15:42.665
Are you still talking?
You're boring me.

15:42.700 --> 15:45.066
(laughs)
ELI:
Hello.

15:45.110 --> 15:47.237
Marissa,
do you have a moment?
Dad.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.532
I do... in a moment.

15:49.580 --> 15:52.549
Why don't you let Zach
do his work?

15:52.580 --> 15:54.241
I'm letting Zach

15:54.280 --> 15:56.271
do his work.
He can multitask.

15:56.320 --> 15:57.309
See?

15:57.350 --> 15:58.510
I'm multitasking.

16:03.260 --> 16:05.228
ZACH:
He's watching us.

16:05.260 --> 16:06.659
Act like I said
something really shocking.

16:08.330 --> 16:09.354
That's terrible.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.061
RICKY:
I've done bad things.

16:11.100 --> 16:13.739
Not as bad
as the things done to me.

16:13.770 --> 16:15.294
COYNE:
It was a double homicide.

16:15.340 --> 16:18.207
Riclq Packer picked up
two 14-year-old girls

16:18.240 --> 16:20.572
from a shopping mall,
raped them over three days,

16:20.610 --> 16:22.237
then slit their throats.

16:22.280 --> 16:24.601
Oh.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.641
(sighs)

16:31.320 --> 16:33.379
COYNE:
Look, we know
he's not a saint.

16:33.420 --> 16:35.388
_All we need
is mitigation.

16:35.420 --> 16:38.253
It's just...

16:38.290 --> 16:40.429
my daughter's their age.

16:40.460 --> 16:42.394
I know.
(sighs)

16:42.430 --> 16:44.421
It's our job.

16:47.400 --> 16:49.368
Grew up on 24th.

16:49.400 --> 16:51.231
Tough neighborhood.

16:51.270 --> 16:52.567
What have you got?

16:52.610 --> 16:54.373
He was born with
neuroblastoma,

16:54.410 --> 16:56.731
a syndrome requiring a
dozen painful surgeries

16:56.780 --> 16:58.372
before the age of five.

16:58.410 --> 17:00.219
That's good.
We can build on that.

17:00.250 --> 17:03.788
And his mother has not
visited him in prison.

17:03.820 --> 17:05.811
Bad and painful childhood,

17:05.850 --> 17:09.149
absentee mom--
we can work with that.

17:09.190 --> 17:12.318
We need some photos
of sadness, squalor.

17:12.360 --> 17:14.555
RICKY:
My mom-- she's always
talking about redemption.

17:14.600 --> 17:16.556
Right?

17:16.600 --> 17:18.329
But redemption from what?

17:18.370 --> 17:20.429
From being a man?

17:20.470 --> 17:22.131
Let's go visit the mom.

17:22.170 --> 17:24.138
You called?

17:24.170 --> 17:26.434
I did call.

17:26.470 --> 17:28.472
I need something.

17:29.440 --> 17:31.670
Footage from
a blue light camera.

17:31.710 --> 17:33.439
(laughs)

17:33.480 --> 17:36.278
Now why would you want access
to our antigang cameras?

17:36.320 --> 17:38.311
Oh, just one
in particular.

17:38.350 --> 17:40.318
19th and Troy.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.385
We have the killer.

17:42.420 --> 17:44.559
No, you don't.

17:44.590 --> 17:48.253
Okay, I give you access,
you give me access.

17:49.860 --> 17:52.067
To what?

18:04.280 --> 18:06.373
Your boss, Will Gardner.

18:06.410 --> 18:07.638
What do you need?

18:07.680 --> 18:09.477
Access.
Why?

18:09.520 --> 18:10.839
We're investigating him.

18:10.890 --> 18:13.279
For what?

18:13.320 --> 18:14.685
I don't think I can do that.

18:14.720 --> 18:16.312
(laughs)

18:16.360 --> 18:18.385
Okay, Kalinda,
I know how you work.

18:18.430 --> 18:20.489
You get want you want
without giving back,

18:20.530 --> 18:22.418
and that's just not
gonna happen here.

18:22.460 --> 18:24.462
You want your back scratched?

18:24.500 --> 18:26.491
I have an itch.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.491
Okay.

18:30.510 --> 18:32.432
What do you need?

18:32.470 --> 18:34.506
He had a friend.

18:34.540 --> 18:35.507
A judge. Baxter.

18:35.540 --> 18:37.747
We need to know the nature
of their relationship.

18:37.780 --> 18:39.645
Get me the blue light camera.

18:39.680 --> 18:41.409
Get me the backstory
on Will.
I asked ﬁrst.

18:42.450 --> 18:44.247
Where'd you get that jacket?

18:44.290 --> 18:45.882
I don't know.

18:45.920 --> 18:47.808
Can I look at the label?

18:47.860 --> 18:49.851
Sure.

18:54.260 --> 18:56.228
Nice.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.898
Thanks.

18:57.930 --> 19:00.125
Breathes.

19:00.970 --> 19:03.507
This is the address?

19:03.540 --> 19:05.508
Yeah.

19:05.540 --> 19:07.531
Not much squalor.

19:11.250 --> 19:13.172
COYNE:
Thank you for seeing us,
Mr. Packer.

19:13.220 --> 19:14.676
We need to_ offer evidence
of mitigation.

19:14.720 --> 19:17.382
Show that your son's crimes
were a result of...

19:18.850 --> 19:21.751
Um, outside causes,
difficulty in childhood,

19:21.790 --> 19:24.452
his upbringing.

19:24.490 --> 19:26.481
(crying):
I'm sorry.

19:26.530 --> 19:28.748
Ijust... It's hard.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.689
Father Jim got all the
neighbors together,

19:31.730 --> 19:34.437
and that helps.

19:34.470 --> 19:37.530
Do you have any pictures
of Riclq as a child?

19:37.570 --> 19:39.561
We want to show the judges
how he grew up.

19:39.610 --> 19:40.736
Of course.

19:40.780 --> 19:43.408
So you haven't seen
your son in prison?

19:43.450 --> 19:44.769
No. He won't let me.

19:44.810 --> 19:46.971
I keep writing every week,
but he won't...

19:47.010 --> 19:48.443
COYNE:
We read that Riclq

19:48.480 --> 19:50.482
had a lot of illnesses
as a child?

19:50.520 --> 19:52.317
Illnesses?
ALICIA:
Yes.

19:52.350 --> 19:54.318
Operations.
Oh, no.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.657
That was his brother, Michael.

19:55.690 --> 19:57.248
He's in New York now.

19:57.290 --> 19:58.587
On Wall Street.

19:58.630 --> 19:59.688
He's broken
up about this.

19:59.730 --> 20:00.924
Um, what about school?

20:00.960 --> 20:02.552
Did he have problems
in school?

20:02.600 --> 20:03.521
Oh, yes.

20:03.570 --> 20:05.367
Michael was always the weakest.

20:05.400 --> 20:06.594
No. Ricky.

20:06.630 --> 20:08.598
Oh. No.

20:08.640 --> 20:09.732
Riclq was fine.

20:09.770 --> 20:11.408
We were able to get him

20:11.440 --> 20:12.668
into a program
at St. Matthew's.

20:12.710 --> 20:15.975
There's Ricky.

20:16.010 --> 20:17.500
ALICIA:
That's a lot of presents.

20:17.550 --> 20:18.346
Well, we wanted them

20:20.820 --> 20:21.969
(doorbell rings)

20:22.020 --> 20:24.511
Would you excuse me?

20:26.550 --> 20:29.451
We could always say
he was too spoiled?

20:29.490 --> 20:30.957
She's a saint.

20:30.990 --> 20:33.527
To have that son--
I don't understand it.

20:33.560 --> 20:35.528
Whatever he wanted,
she was there.

20:35.560 --> 20:38.666
You think he really did it,
he killed those two girls?

20:40.570 --> 20:41.594
Why?

20:41.640 --> 20:43.335
He liked doing
mean things.

20:43.370 --> 20:45.031
It was fun for him.

20:45.070 --> 20:47.277
COYNE:
Is there anything
that you can say

20:47.310 --> 20:48.868
to help the court
at all, anything

20:48.910 --> 20:50.377
that would save
his life?

20:50.410 --> 20:52.298
He shouldn't be killed.

20:54.550 --> 20:56.040
That was a wash.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.809
Do you believe that?

20:57.850 --> 20:59.488
What?

20:59.520 --> 21:01.408
That no matter who he is,

21:01.460 --> 21:03.621
no matter what he did,
he shouldn't be killed?

21:03.660 --> 21:05.855
Yeah. Don't you?

21:05.890 --> 21:08.450
I saw those photos.

21:08.500 --> 21:11.560
Those girls
were my daughter's age.

21:12.570 --> 21:14.561
They don't exist anymore.

21:14.600 --> 21:16.864
And to get that call.

21:16.900 --> 21:20.438
To spend every night

21:20.480 --> 21:23.472
thinking about your daughter's
last breath...

21:25.580 --> 21:27.548
He raped...

21:27.580 --> 21:29.912
Did you see what he did
with their bodies?

21:29.950 --> 21:31.087
But we don't execute him.

21:31.120 --> 21:32.747
Why not?

21:32.790 --> 21:34.655
Because it would be wrong.

21:44.730 --> 21:47.665
DANA:
What day are you looking for?

21:47.700 --> 21:50.806
June 15, the day
Adrianne Iver disappeared.

21:50.840 --> 21:53.502
Okay.

21:53.540 --> 21:55.599
There you go--
corner of 19th and Troy.

21:55.640 --> 21:57.574
Okay. There he is.

21:57.610 --> 21:59.976
That's the victim, right?
That's what he was wearing?

22:00.010 --> 22:01.910
Uh, yeah.
That's his corner.

22:01.950 --> 22:03.645
'Kay, and that's
the night

22:03.690 --> 22:05.339
Ms. Iver died?

22:05.390 --> 22:08.359
My guess is there's someone else
on the corner the next night.

22:08.390 --> 22:10.779
You want to... you want
to see the next night?

22:10.830 --> 22:12.786
If you'd be so kind.

22:12.830 --> 22:14.798
(keyboard clacking)

22:14.830 --> 22:17.048
Do you know anything about
Will Gardner's relationship

22:17.100 --> 22:18.499
with Judge Baxter?

22:20.840 --> 22:22.660
They had a falling out.

22:22.700 --> 22:24.531
He was a corrupt judge.

22:24.570 --> 22:26.709
Will got him
thrown off the bench.

22:26.740 --> 22:28.628
No, our office got him
thrown off the bench.

22:28.680 --> 22:29.669
Gardner didn't do crap.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.147
There.

22:32.180 --> 22:34.512
That's the next night?

22:34.550 --> 22:35.972
It is.

22:36.020 --> 22:37.988
You have the wrong man, Dana.

22:38.020 --> 22:40.659
It was a corner fight,
and he took the corner.

22:40.690 --> 22:42.715
That's why he killed
the 22nd Disciple--

22:42.760 --> 22:44.057
so he could take
the corner.

22:44.090 --> 22:48.459
My guess is, that man
killed Adrianne Iver, too.

22:59.940 --> 23:01.805
Your Honors, Ricky Packer
is a changed man.

23:01.840 --> 23:03.501
H_is rehabilitation
is a testament

23:03.550 --> 23:05.404
to the dignity of
the human spirit

23:05.450 --> 23:07.941
even in the face
of great adverSIty.

23:07.980 --> 23:10.915
We ask that you show
mercy and compassion...

23:10.950 --> 23:13.145
(whispers):
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

23:13.190 --> 23:14.452
That's all right.

23:14.490 --> 23:16.117
Is this good?
Yes.

23:16.160 --> 23:18.685
Thank you.
Mr. Packer's defense attorney
never availed himself

23:18.730 --> 23:22.120
of mitigation witnesses during
the penalty phase of the trial.

23:22.160 --> 23:23.627
As you can see,

23:23.670 --> 23:24.921
there are many people here

23:24.970 --> 23:27.165
who would speak
to Mr. Packer's...

23:27.200 --> 23:28.963
fine character.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.434
He has changed in
prison, Your Honors.

23:31.470 --> 23:33.677
He had an unfortunate
upbringing-- none of
the opportunities

23:33.710 --> 23:35.530
that you or I have had.

23:35.580 --> 23:37.571
Just listen to his mother--
she will speak

23:37.610 --> 23:39.202
to how hard it
was for Riclq,

23:39.250 --> 23:41.639
growing up in their tough
South Side neighborhood,

23:41.680 --> 23:43.819
how she neglected
Riclq as a child,

23:43.850 --> 23:47.115
and even now, how she
has not seen her son

23:47.150 --> 23:49.516
in prison.

23:49.560 --> 23:52.154
Imagine being a child in the
inner city, with no hope...

23:52.190 --> 23:54.192
I've known Ricky Packer
all his life.

23:54.230 --> 23:55.857
I was there at his baptism.

23:55.900 --> 23:59.119
I'm here to say that Ricky
Packer's a good person.

23:59.170 --> 24:00.865
He's a redeemable person.

24:00.900 --> 24:02.697
He has been led astray,

24:02.740 --> 24:06.107
and I take it as__
my own person failing

24:06.140 --> 24:07.937
that I didn't lead him back.

24:12.850 --> 24:15.478
He's not a good person.

24:15.520 --> 24:19.240
No. I said what I said
so he wouldn't be killed.

24:19.290 --> 24:22.259
And it's all right
to do that?

24:22.290 --> 24:24.554
Nothing is very clean.

24:24.590 --> 24:26.888
The older I get the
more I realize that.

24:26.930 --> 24:30.889
What if... what if it
meant releasing him?

24:30.930 --> 24:33.763
Then we would be having
another conversation.

24:34.800 --> 24:37.166
Looks like it worked.

24:37.200 --> 24:40.237
Well, they're
considering
the appeal.

24:40.270 --> 24:42.238
We have a
24-hour extension

24:42.280 --> 24:44.771
and access to Ricky
Packer. So, Alicia?

24:44.810 --> 24:46.141
Where is Alicia?

24:46.180 --> 24:48.171
Oh. I need you to
get to Indiana.

24:48.220 --> 24:50.711
Andr says Riclq Packer
likes talking with women,

24:50.750 --> 24:51.944
so you talk with Riclq,

24:51.990 --> 24:54.117
and we'll work
the appeal.

24:55.920 --> 24:57.251
All right, let's get going.

24:57.290 --> 24:59.281
Work on the appeal.

24:59.330 --> 25:01.525
Alicia...

25:01.560 --> 25:03.767
are you all right
doing this, going to him?

25:03.800 --> 25:05.893
I'm all right doing this.

25:05.930 --> 25:07.932
It's my job.
Okay.

25:07.970 --> 25:09.198
Then head out.

25:09.240 --> 25:10.730
GRACE:
Just doing homework.

25:10.770 --> 25:12.829
Jennifer's coming over later
for tutoring.

25:12.870 --> 25:13.871
Okay.

25:13.910 --> 25:16.071
Uh, I already talked to Zach...

25:16.110 --> 25:18.271
but I'm working on this...

25:18.310 --> 25:20.813
case, and I don't know
what time I'll be home.

25:20.850 --> 25:22.772
So Dad is gonna come over
and pick you up

25:22.820 --> 25:24.640
and take you
to his place, all right?

25:24.690 --> 25:26.749
We can take care
of ourselves, Mom.

25:26.790 --> 25:28.712
No. I already talked to Dad.

25:28.760 --> 25:30.318
And lock the door, okay, Grace?

25:30.360 --> 25:32.749
I know sometimes we forget,
but just do it.

25:32.790 --> 25:33.927
(laughs):
Okay.

25:33.960 --> 25:35.757
Is everything all right?

25:35.800 --> 25:37.927
I think so.

25:37.970 --> 25:40.859
You come straight home from
school every day, don't you?

25:40.900 --> 25:42.162
Mom, you're getting weird.

25:42.200 --> 25:44.134
I know.

25:44.170 --> 25:45.762
I love you.

25:45.810 --> 25:47.801
Bye.

25:47.840 --> 25:49.831
(buzzer sounds)

25:50.980 --> 25:52.607
MAN:
Eli Gold

25:52.650 --> 25:54.948
and Mickey Gunn.
I think that's the third sign

25:54.980 --> 25:57.619
of the apocalypse--
you guys working together.

25:57.650 --> 25:58.947
(laughter)

25:58.990 --> 26:01.311
But only on something
we truly believe in.
Yeah.

26:01.360 --> 26:02.657
You know Robert Mulvey?

26:02.690 --> 26:03.759
The ex-congressman.

26:03.790 --> 26:06.088
The one that flipped from
Republican to Democrat.

26:06.130 --> 26:09.054
I hear he's looking for a
campaign he can win, isn't he?

26:09.100 --> 26:10.692
Mickey represents him.

26:10.730 --> 26:13.198
And we want
to offer you a story.

26:13.230 --> 26:14.663
About him?
About Mickey.

26:14.700 --> 26:15.962
It's a sort of
think piece

26:16.000 --> 26:17.194
about the next generation
of candidates.

26:17.240 --> 26:20.300
Really! You got
a headline for me, too?

26:20.340 --> 26:22.376
(forced laughter)

26:22.410 --> 26:24.002
Your sweat's showing, guys.

26:25.050 --> 26:26.779
We have a picture.

26:26.810 --> 26:30.211
It's not as bad
as Anthony Weiner,
but in our opinion,

26:30.250 --> 26:34.311
it encapsulates the problems
of the Facebook—era candidate.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.920
He slept with a
campaign worker?

26:44.030 --> 26:46.225
(laughs)

26:46.270 --> 26:47.931
That's him?

26:47.970 --> 26:49.289
That's Robert Mulvey?

26:49.340 --> 26:52.002
It is.

26:52.040 --> 26:54.008
You want to hang a lantern
on your problem.

26:54.040 --> 26:55.007
Hang a lantern on what?

26:55.040 --> 26:56.905
This has nothing to do
with Mulvey's policy.

26:56.940 --> 26:58.407
This has nothing to do
with his morals.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.771
Really? Servicing Santa's
not about his morals?

27:00.820 --> 27:02.378
It ain't the real Santa,

27:02.420 --> 27:03.409
it's a statue.

27:03.450 --> 27:05.111
And there is no real Santa,

27:05.150 --> 27:07.345
so he wouldn't
have a penis.

27:07.390 --> 27:10.723
Look, the real story here
is Mickey Gunn,

27:10.760 --> 27:14.252
and how he deals with a photo
that is, admittedly, ridiculous,

27:14.300 --> 27:16.029
but is also irrelevant

27:16.060 --> 27:17.994
to Mulvey's character.

27:18.030 --> 27:20.225
Look, I'm fine.
You want to give me something,

27:20.270 --> 27:23.262
give me something,
but why don't you
put the candidate on?

27:23.300 --> 27:25.860
We'll see what we can do.

27:25.910 --> 27:27.935
(phone vibrating)

27:27.980 --> 27:29.174
Would you excuse me a moment?

27:29.210 --> 27:30.802
So, you want to cancel dinner?

27:30.850 --> 27:31.646
You know me. Flighty.

27:31.680 --> 27:32.977
ZACH:
You want something to drink?

27:33.010 --> 27:34.910
Where are you, Marissa?

27:34.950 --> 27:36.315
Getting computer advice, Dad.

27:36.350 --> 27:38.181
I'll call you later.

27:38.220 --> 27:40.040
Uh...

27:40.090 --> 27:42.957
How long have your
parents lived apart?

27:42.990 --> 27:44.981
I... What
do you mean?

27:45.030 --> 27:46.952
Don't worry, my dad told me.

27:46.990 --> 27:48.423
When did they split up?

27:48.460 --> 27:50.155
About five months ago.
I'll give you

27:50.200 --> 27:51.724
all the tips
on how to use it.

27:51.770 --> 27:54.466
Parents going through
divorce are so guilty.

27:54.500 --> 27:55.694
(door opens)

27:55.740 --> 27:57.708
That's my dad, to
come pick me up.

27:57.740 --> 27:59.230
JACKIE (calls):
Zach?

27:59.270 --> 28:00.828
Oh, hello.

28:00.880 --> 28:04.145
Grandma.
Peter had to work today,
so he asked me

28:04.180 --> 28:05.374
to look in on you.

28:05.410 --> 28:07.469
Hello.
Hello. I'm Marissa.

28:07.510 --> 28:09.978
Are you the new tutor?
No.

28:10.020 --> 28:11.248
I'm Eli Gold's daughter.

28:11.290 --> 28:12.917
Oh. Really?

28:12.950 --> 28:15.111
And, uh, what are we doing here?

28:15.160 --> 28:17.481
What are we doing here, Zach?

28:17.520 --> 28:20.421
I was just showing her
how to change her dad's
computer settings.

28:20.460 --> 28:22.428
Grace, Grandma's here!

28:24.330 --> 28:26.321
(knocking)

28:30.870 --> 28:32.804
Is Grace here?

28:34.310 --> 28:35.436
(door closes)

28:35.480 --> 28:38.301
I thought you were out there
trying to save the world.

28:38.350 --> 28:41.171
I was; now I'm here.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.017
You look serious.

28:43.050 --> 28:45.280
An ASA in
Peter Florrick's office

28:45.320 --> 28:47.140
is asking about
your relationship

28:47.190 --> 28:49.249
with Judge Baxter.

28:49.290 --> 28:51.121
You in trouble?

28:52.990 --> 28:54.958
(exhales)
I'm in something.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.524
I don't know what I'm in.

28:56.560 --> 28:58.289
Who's the ASA?

28:58.330 --> 29:00.867
Dana Lodge. I think
she's working with Cary.

29:03.540 --> 29:06.100
Is this coming
from Peter Florrick?

29:08.510 --> 29:10.432
I think it is.

29:16.180 --> 29:17.078
I don't know.

29:17.120 --> 29:18.212
I don't know anything anymore.

29:18.250 --> 29:21.014
I used to_be able to read
the political tea leaves,

29:21.060 --> 29:24.120
now I can barely tell why people
say hello to me in the morning.

29:25.560 --> 29:27.926
Then use me.

29:27.960 --> 29:30.121
Thought you were
an island these days.

29:30.160 --> 29:32.060
Mm, no man is an island.

29:32.100 --> 29:34.933
(chuckles)
I don't know, Kalinda,
this one is tough.

29:34.970 --> 29:36.062
They're coming for me.

29:36.100 --> 29:38.933
Did you pay off Baxter?

29:38.970 --> 29:39.868
No.

29:39.910 --> 29:43.073
But I thinkI know
why they think I did.

29:43.110 --> 29:45.249
Okay, then ask for my help.

29:52.190 --> 29:54.181
I feel like hugging you.

29:54.220 --> 29:56.518
No, just...

29:56.560 --> 29:58.824
just ask for my help.

30:00.360 --> 30:03.090
(men chattering in distance)

30:03.130 --> 30:04.927
(buzzer sounds)

30:06.130 --> 30:08.030
(man shouting indistinctly
in distance)

30:09.270 --> 30:10.931
You okay?

30:10.970 --> 30:12.961
I will be.

30:15.210 --> 30:16.472
(buzzer sounds)

30:16.510 --> 30:18.501
(men chattering in distance)

30:27.220 --> 30:29.950
(door closes, locks)

30:36.560 --> 30:39.199
You need something?

30:47.240 --> 30:49.174
You discussed
with Andr Bergson,

30:49.210 --> 30:51.201
the filmmaker,
a murder?

30:51.250 --> 30:53.502
A buried body?

30:53.550 --> 30:55.916
(quietly):
Wow.

30:55.950 --> 31:00.182
(wry laugh)
A man becomes very popular
in his last hours of life.

31:00.220 --> 31:02.916
You said you know
who killed him?

31:05.160 --> 31:07.048
What's your name?

31:10.200 --> 31:12.088
Alicia Florrick.

31:12.130 --> 31:15.998
Andr said to send a girl,
didn't he?

31:17.140 --> 31:18.459
Yes.

31:18.510 --> 31:20.159
(laughs)

31:20.210 --> 31:22.974
And here you are.
It would help us
greatly if you

31:23.010 --> 31:24.443
could tell us
who committed this murder.

31:24.480 --> 31:27.176
Didn't the cops find someone?

31:27.210 --> 31:29.644
Yes, a juvenile
from a competing gang.

31:29.680 --> 31:33.241
But we think it's this man.

31:37.260 --> 31:38.386
Yeah.

31:38.430 --> 31:40.386
Can you tell us who this is?

31:41.430 --> 31:43.318
Why should I?

31:44.530 --> 31:46.669
We're helping you
with your appeal.

31:46.700 --> 31:48.258
(scoffs):
Yeah.
We successfully argued

31:48.300 --> 31:49.631
in front of the 7th Circuit.

31:49.670 --> 31:51.558
They just like torturing me.

31:51.610 --> 31:55.273
They say they'll reconsider,
but I'll be dead come Sunday.

31:55.310 --> 31:57.175
Then why not help us?

31:57.210 --> 31:59.246
(chuckles)

32:00.210 --> 32:02.269
(chuckles)

32:03.450 --> 32:05.315
(exhales)

32:06.690 --> 32:09.716
I heard my mom argued for me.

32:09.760 --> 32:12.558
She did.

32:14.200 --> 32:16.020
And my brother?

32:19.200 --> 32:22.294
It was hard on both of them,
but they argued for you.

32:32.450 --> 32:35.749
You get them here...
then I'll tell you.

32:35.780 --> 32:38.283
I... I don't know
if we have time.

32:38.320 --> 32:40.083
Well, make the time.

32:43.260 --> 32:46.081
I'll get them.
Just tell me who this is.

32:50.260 --> 32:53.229
Who is this, Riclq?
Just tell me.

32:59.610 --> 33:03.034
KALINDA:
Ervin Womack, aka Mace.

33:03.080 --> 33:05.469
He's your man.

33:08.420 --> 33:10.411
(speaking low, indistinctly)

33:12.650 --> 33:15.312
* Na-na-n-na-n-na-na-n-na
(both laughing)

33:15.360 --> 33:18.625
* N-na-na-n-na-n-na-n-na-n-na

33:18.660 --> 33:20.628
* Na-na_-n-na-n-na-n_a-n-na
It's just rearranging
the desktop, so try.

33:20.660 --> 33:21.627
Okay.

33:21.660 --> 33:24.595
* N-na-na-n-na-n-na-n-na-n-na

33:24.630 --> 33:28.168
* Na-na-n-na-
n-na-na-n-na *

33:28.200 --> 33:30.634
* N-na-na-n-na-n-na-n-na-n-na

33:30.670 --> 33:34.071
* Na-na-n-na-n-
na-na-n-na *

33:34.110 --> 33:37.102
*
One, two, three, ow!

33:40.810 --> 33:43.779
* Show me all the things
the other girlies know *

33:43.820 --> 33:46.311
* They cannot pull off

33:47.320 --> 33:49.288
* Dangerous with killer heels

33:49.320 --> 33:52.323
* Your stockings go
a mile high... *

33:56.400 --> 33:59.790
Chris, do, uh, do I
admit to being young,

33:59.830 --> 34:01.491
stupid, even immature?

34:01.540 --> 34:04.065
Yes, but the 21-year-
old Robert Mulvey

34:04.110 --> 34:05.702
is not the 34-year-
old Robert Mulvey.

34:05.740 --> 34:07.708
And you think we shouldn't
judge you because it was just

34:07.740 --> 34:09.139
this one time?

34:09.180 --> 34:10.374
MULVEY:
Well, I think
you should judge me

34:10.410 --> 34:12.207
on what I say and what I do now.

34:12.250 --> 34:13.399
(chuckles)

34:13.450 --> 34:14.678
And what if it's more
than one time?

34:14.720 --> 34:17.541
These photos were taken on the
same winter break, Congressman.

34:17.580 --> 34:18.717
Oh, dear God.

34:18.750 --> 34:21.412
Is that you at the National
Gallery Sculpture Garden?

34:21.460 --> 34:24.224
(clears throat)
GUNN:
Don't go there, no,
please don't go there.

34:24.260 --> 34:26.478
And is that George Washington?

34:27.730 --> 34:30.790
Well, H,
I don't believe they, um...

34:30.830 --> 34:33.492
I would, I would need
to get a closer look.

34:33.530 --> 34:35.532
Uh, we need to talk
to your politician.

34:35.570 --> 34:37.868
DANA:
You look serious.

34:37.900 --> 34:40.607
I'm a serious guy.

34:40.640 --> 34:41.732
Ervin Womack,
aka Mace.

34:41.780 --> 34:45.341
I think we should question him
for the 22nd Disciple hit.

34:45.380 --> 34:46.369
Closed that.

34:46.410 --> 34:47.445
Yeah, with a juvenile.

34:47.480 --> 34:50.244
This guy's adult.

34:50.280 --> 34:51.542
Is that what Kalinda said?

34:51.590 --> 34:54.354
You mean
your girlfriend Kalinda?

34:54.390 --> 34:56.255
(laughs)

34:56.290 --> 34:59.179
No, I mean yours.

34:59.230 --> 35:01.551
Uh, no, don't stop there.

35:01.600 --> 35:02.624
You're on a roll.

35:02.660 --> 35:04.662
Yeah, I saw you two-- it
looked more than friendly.

35:04.700 --> 35:07.419
Really, and what does "more
than friendly" look like?

35:07.470 --> 35:09.495
Like more than friendly.

35:09.540 --> 35:11.405
(laughs)

35:11.440 --> 35:14.170
Cary, listen
to my words now, okay?

35:14.210 --> 35:15.404
I have never said
this before,

35:15.440 --> 35:16.805
but I am now going
to say it for you.

35:16.840 --> 35:17.807
Are you ready?

35:17.840 --> 35:19.478
(grunts)

35:19.510 --> 35:21.512
I am not a lesbian.

35:21.550 --> 35:24.417
I know a lot of people
who weren't anything

35:24.450 --> 35:25.815
until they met Kalinda.

35:29.220 --> 35:31.529
What?
You still pining
for your lesbian?

35:31.560 --> 35:32.527
Okay, now you're
turning it.

35:32.560 --> 35:33.788
This isn't about me.

35:33.830 --> 35:35.593
Okay, that's enough
for me.

35:35.630 --> 35:36.392
Going home now.

35:36.430 --> 35:38.295
You want to question Mace,
go for it.

35:38.330 --> 35:39.524
You're the deputy.

35:39.570 --> 35:40.594
Kalinda is trying to get

35:40.630 --> 35:42.166
to me through you.

35:42.200 --> 35:43.667
Yeah, and it seems
to be working.

35:43.700 --> 35:45.839
Figure out
what you want, Cary,

35:45.870 --> 35:47.667
then we can talk.

35:47.710 --> 35:49.405
I don't want her.

35:49.440 --> 35:51.442
Good to know.

36:23.640 --> 36:26.643
*

36:46.270 --> 36:47.589
What do you know about him?
Not much.

36:47.630 --> 36:49.666
Alicia got a tip
from death row.

36:49.700 --> 36:51.509
You found out
something on him?

36:51.540 --> 36:53.360
His description matched
another murder.

36:53.410 --> 36:54.536
We just want to
question him.

36:54.580 --> 36:56.502
Nobody's going in hard.

36:56.540 --> 36:59.270
So you talk to ASA Lodge
these days?

36:59.310 --> 37:01.847
Yeah, you,
too, huh?

37:01.880 --> 37:03.848
What are you doing?

37:03.880 --> 37:05.643
What am I doing?

37:05.690 --> 37:06.748
Yeah.

37:06.790 --> 37:08.519
Don't, okay?

37:08.560 --> 37:09.310
Don't.

37:09.360 --> 37:10.713
(knocking)
OFFICER:
Chicago Police.

37:10.760 --> 37:12.557
We have a warrant
for Ervin Womack.
Cary,

37:12.590 --> 37:15.297
look, ASA Lodge
approached me.

37:15.330 --> 37:16.820
She gave me her card-- if you
have a problem with that,

37:16.860 --> 37:18.327
then you need to sort
that out with her.

37:18.370 --> 37:19.894
She's not the one
I mistrust.

37:19.930 --> 37:22.467
Go to hell, Cary.

37:22.500 --> 37:23.467
Do you think that...?

37:23.500 --> 37:24.637
(gunshots)

37:24.670 --> 37:27.332
(indistinct yelling)

37:28.610 --> 37:30.771
OFFICER:
Womack, freeze!

37:33.310 --> 37:35.642
OFFICER:
Is everybody okay?

37:39.450 --> 37:41.418
You all right?

37:41.460 --> 37:42.415
Yeah, you?

37:42.460 --> 37:43.757
Yeah.

37:43.790 --> 37:45.826
Looks like a Walther P99.

37:46.860 --> 37:49.749
That's Tom's gun.

37:49.800 --> 37:52.963
I say this
with some trepidation,

37:53.000 --> 37:56.868
but a failing is a failing.

37:56.900 --> 37:58.538
I am an alcoholic.

37:58.570 --> 37:59.537
GUNN:
Nice work.

37:59.570 --> 38:00.730
Changes the subject.

38:00.770 --> 38:01.805
Thanks.

38:01.840 --> 38:02.807
The only place
left to go.

38:02.840 --> 38:03.807
Ithought

38:03.840 --> 38:08.914
foolishly that I had taken care
of my problem,

38:08.950 --> 38:12.386
but as all alcoholics know,
it's never over,

38:12.420 --> 38:14.081
so I'm going back
into the program.

38:14.120 --> 38:16.588
(sighs)
All right, so I'll talk
to you when he gets out.

38:16.620 --> 38:19.487
Yeah.

38:19.530 --> 38:21.498
I like him.

38:21.530 --> 38:22.690
Not a bad guy.

38:22.730 --> 38:24.095
Still room to corrupt him.

38:24.130 --> 38:25.563
(chuckles)

38:25.600 --> 38:27.727
I'm thinking of him
for state senate first.

38:27.770 --> 38:29.761
S-State senate here?

38:30.800 --> 38:33.701
Yeah, what were you thinking?

38:33.740 --> 38:35.708
I just didn't know
you were thinking local.

38:35.740 --> 38:36.934
Only as a jumping-off point.

38:38.710 --> 38:40.644
What's wrong,
is that too small for you?

38:40.680 --> 38:44.446
My ex-wife is running
for state senate.

38:44.490 --> 38:45.684
(laughs)
Really?

38:45.720 --> 38:47.381
Well,

38:47.420 --> 38:49.911
that's, uh, unfortunate.

38:49.960 --> 38:51.780
Yep.

38:51.830 --> 38:56.051
Okay, thanks
for your help, buddy.

38:56.100 --> 38:58.091
I'll see you.

39:00.670 --> 39:02.831
(buzzer sounds)

39:02.870 --> 39:05.100
He lost the appeal.

39:05.140 --> 39:07.335
Execution is
gomg forward.

39:08.840 --> 39:10.569
(tires squeal)

39:10.610 --> 39:12.407
Suzanne, thank you
for coming.

39:12.450 --> 39:13.200
We need to hurry.

39:13.250 --> 39:14.672
We got here as
fast as we could.

39:14.720 --> 39:15.675
This is Michael.

39:15.720 --> 39:19.747
Yes, come
this way, please.

39:19.790 --> 39:21.758
(buzzer sounds)

39:21.790 --> 39:24.623
Just so you know, Mrs. Packer,
he helped us with our case.

39:24.660 --> 39:26.685
We found the real killer,
and our client will be freed.

39:26.730 --> 39:27.924
I don't know
if that helps.

39:27.960 --> 39:30.656
It helps,
thank you.

39:30.700 --> 39:31.826
It's Riclq's mother.

39:31.870 --> 39:32.825
Tell them we're coming.

39:34.840 --> 39:36.831
(buzzer sounds)
Thank you.

39:39.640 --> 39:41.062
He'll be coming
out of that door.

39:41.110 --> 39:42.532
We have to stay
out here.

39:44.910 --> 39:47.879
He really helped
you with your case?

39:47.910 --> 39:49.571
Yes. You sound surprised.

39:49.620 --> 39:51.884
I'm, uh, I know there's
supposed to be good

39:51.920 --> 39:54.855
in everyone, but sometimes
it's just hard to see,

39:54.890 --> 39:57.017
so this gives me hope.

39:58.790 --> 40:00.758
Here he comes now.

40:00.790 --> 40:03.156
SUZANNE:
Riclq.

40:03.200 --> 40:04.997
(buzzer sounds)

40:07.900 --> 40:10.460
(sobbing)

40:10.500 --> 40:12.434
RICKY:
Ma.

40:12.470 --> 40:14.028
It's me.

40:14.070 --> 40:16.868
It's Michael.

40:17.910 --> 40:20.743
I'm going away now.

40:22.750 --> 40:24.786
We love you.

40:26.750 --> 40:28.889
I know.

40:29.920 --> 40:32.024
What can we do for you?

40:35.830 --> 40:39.095
Burn in hell, both of you.

40:41.970 --> 40:44.097
I want you to suffer every day
of your life thinking of me.

40:46.610 --> 40:47.804
(laughing)

40:50.110 --> 40:51.941
Bye, Mom.

40:51.980 --> 40:53.208
Love you.

40:53.250 --> 40:54.205
It was fun.

40:54.250 --> 40:55.877
(laughing)

41:11.530 --> 41:13.521
Yeah, okay, okay, thank you.

41:14.600 --> 41:17.831
It is the gun,
Tom LaVere's gun.

41:20.670 --> 41:22.672
We're releasing him.

41:24.140 --> 41:26.108
You all right?

41:26.150 --> 41:30.211
Uh, considering it was
my first gunfight.

41:30.250 --> 41:32.218
You?

41:32.250 --> 41:36.858
Yeah, thanks for pulling me
down, for protecting me.

41:41.090 --> 41:43.058
What do you want from me,
KaHnda?

41:43.100 --> 41:46.297
What do I want from you?

41:46.330 --> 41:48.594
Why does everybody always think
that I want something?

41:48.640 --> 41:51.063
'Cause you do.

41:51.100 --> 41:53.000
She's not attracted
to women.

41:54.040 --> 41:56.179
Cary, you make me
too calculated.

41:56.210 --> 41:59.702
Look, I came here, you
weren't here, she was here,

41:59.750 --> 42:02.241
so I asked her about
the case, that's all.

42:02.280 --> 42:05.545
You've got blood
on your ear.

42:07.350 --> 42:09.557
Unden

42:09.590 --> 42:11.012
(sighs)

42:12.860 --> 42:15.158
I don't like you
being in my head.

42:15.200 --> 42:18.089
What?

42:19.730 --> 42:22.699
I said, I don't like you
being in my head.

42:22.740 --> 42:24.867
Then get me out.

42:48.090 --> 42:50.058
What are we doing?

42:50.100 --> 42:52.625
I have no idea.

42:58.200 --> 43:00.202
What?

43:03.410 --> 43:05.605
(door opens)
