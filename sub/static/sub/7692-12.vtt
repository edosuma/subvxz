WEBVTT

00:06.674 --> 00:09.277
Tasha:
OH, THIS IS SO EXCITING!

00:09.310 --> 00:12.513
I HAVE NEVER BEEN
TO AUSTRALIA BEFORE.

00:12.546 --> 00:17.551
HEY, MAYBE YOU'LL
 LIKE IT SO MUCH
 YOU WON'T WANT TO COME BACK!

00:17.585 --> 00:19.487
DONALD, HONEY, DO YOU
HAVE THE PLANE TICKETS?

00:19.520 --> 00:24.225
(laughs) HONEY, WE'RE TAKING
MY FULLY AUTOMATED PRIVATE JET.

00:24.258 --> 00:27.628
(scoffs) PLANE TICKETS.
WHY DON'T WE JUST
SLAP ON A BUNCH OF STAMPS

00:27.661 --> 00:30.331
AND MAIL OURSELVE(laughs)

00:30.364 --> 00:34.535
PRIVATE JET.
THAT WORKS.

00:34.568 --> 00:37.405
SCORE!

00:37.438 --> 00:39.573
OKAY, LEO,
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO PROVE

00:39.607 --> 00:42.143
YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE ENOUGH
TO STAY AT HOME WITHOUT US.

00:42.176 --> 00:44.245
ME? WHAT ABOUT THEM?

00:44.278 --> 00:47.648
THEY WERE DESIGNED
 TO GO ON MISSIONS
 AND SAVE THE WORLD.

00:50.518 --> 00:52.686
YOU WERE DESIGNED
 TO BREAK STUFF.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.524
DON'T WORRY,
I KNOW THE RULES--

00:56.557 --> 00:59.059
NO TOUCHY-TOUCHY
YOUR STUFFY-STUFFY.

00:59.093 --> 01:04.265
LEO, I'M SERIOUS.
THERE'S MILLIONS OF DOLLARS'
WORTH OF TECHNOLOGY HERE.

01:04.298 --> 01:07.801
SO NO GOOF-UPS,
NO EXPLOSIONS,
NO FIRES--

01:07.835 --> 01:10.304
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOT GOING.
I'M NOT GOING.

01:10.338 --> 01:14.408
DONALD, LEO WILL
BE RESPONSIBLE.
HE IS A BIG BOY.

01:14.442 --> 01:19.113
SWEETIE, I LEFT YOUR
FLAME-RETARDANT UNDIES
ON THE DRESSER.

01:19.147 --> 01:22.183
MR. DAVENPORT,
LEO WILL BE FINE.

01:22.216 --> 01:24.352
I MEAN, WHAT'S THE WORST
THAT COULD HAPPEN?

01:24.385 --> 01:25.786
FUNNY YOU SHOULD ASK.

01:25.819 --> 01:29.290
I'VE MADE AN ACTUARY CHART
WHICH COVERS EVERY
POSSIBLE CATASTROPHE.

01:29.323 --> 01:33.261
YOU HAVE AN 82% CHANCE
OF COMING BACK TO
A PERFECTLY NORMAL HOUSE.

01:34.828 --> 01:37.097
HAPPY TRAVELS.

01:37.131 --> 01:39.167
DON'T WORRY!

01:39.200 --> 01:41.735
EDDIE IS HERE TO MONITOR
EVERY ROOM IN THE HOUSE.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.804
HE IS LIKE
A VIRTUAL BABY-SITTER.

01:43.837 --> 01:47.808
YEAH, AND I VIRTUALLY
 CARE ABOUT YOUR KIDS.

01:47.841 --> 01:50.444
BIG D, I GOT THIS.

01:50.478 --> 01:53.647
NO EXPLOSIONS, NO GOOF-UPS,
NO FIRES, NO FLOODS--

01:53.681 --> 01:57.084
WAIT. I DIDN'T
DONALD, LET'S GO!!!

01:57.117 --> 02:00.221
(aOKAY, BE CAREFUL.s)

02:00.254 --> 02:02.823
THERE'S AN INFLATABLE RAFT
IN THE CLOSET.

02:02.856 --> 02:06.360
ALGOODBYE! GO!.

02:08.496 --> 02:11.465
WHOO-HOO!
PARTY IN THEWHOO!

02:11.499 --> 02:13.801
DID YOU NOT HEAR
WHAT DAVENPORT JUST SAID?

02:13.834 --> 02:15.703
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
REOH, RIGHT.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.671
I'LL BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE SNACKS.

02:17.705 --> 02:20.140
LEO, YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE
FOR BLOWING UP THAT RAFT!

02:20.174 --> 02:22.576
WHOO-HOO!
PARTY IN TYEAH!!!

02:22.610 --> 02:25.213
WHOO-HOO!

02:25.246 --> 02:28.416
AND HE'S WORRIED ABOUT ME?

02:28.449 --> 02:31.552
Narrator:
 THE WORLD'S FIRST
 BIONIC SUPERHUMANS.

02:31.585 --> 02:35.589
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN US,
 FASTER, SMARTER.

02:35.623 --> 02:38.226
THE NEXT GENERATION
 OF THE HUMAN RACE IS--

02:38.259 --> 02:40.461
LIVING IN MY BASEMENT?!

02:40.494 --> 02:43.831
**

02:49.670 --> 02:50.771
AAAH!

03:20.268 --> 03:22.370
AUSTRALIA LOOKS INTERESTING.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.538
BUT I'D REALLY LIKE TO
CHECK OUT NEW YORK.

03:24.572 --> 03:26.540
YEAH, WELL, MAYBE SOMEDAY
WHEN WE'RE OLDER--

03:27.775 --> 03:29.577
OR NOW.

03:31.379 --> 03:33.213
AND WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

03:33.247 --> 03:35.483
I AM COMBINING FOODS.

03:35.516 --> 03:37.851
BUTTERSCOTCH PUDDING
AND TOMATOES IS PROBABLY A NO,

03:37.885 --> 03:41.455
BUT BEING HOME ALONE
 AND DOING WHATEVER I WANT
 IS A HUGE YES,

03:41.489 --> 03:43.223
SO I'M GONNA DO IT ANYWAY!

03:45.726 --> 03:48.296
OH, THAT IS BAD.

03:50.531 --> 03:53.534
CHASE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
AT DAVENPORT'S COMPUTER?

03:53.567 --> 03:55.336
I'M PULLING A PRANK ON HIM.

03:55.369 --> 03:57.204
THE NEXT TIME HE CHECKS
HIS BANK ACCOUNT,

03:57.237 --> 03:59.239
IT'S GONNA BE IN EUROS!

03:59.273 --> 04:02.476
BAM!

04:02.510 --> 04:04.845
SAME VALUE,
BUT STILL FUNNY, RIGHT?

04:04.878 --> 04:06.747
NO.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.549
NO, NO--

04:08.582 --> 04:09.617
GIVE IT TO ME.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.388
WHERE WERE YOU?

04:14.422 --> 04:16.457
WELL, I WAS HEADED
TO NEW YORK CITY,

04:16.490 --> 04:17.891
BUT I GOT STUCK IN JERSEY.

04:17.925 --> 04:21.661
CHECK OUT MY BLING. BOOM!

04:21.695 --> 04:25.599
HOW'S YA LIKE
THEM SPARKLERS?

04:25.633 --> 04:26.834
BREE,
LOOK WHAT YOU DID!

04:26.867 --> 04:29.870
YOU GOT BUTTERSCOTCH PUDDING
ALL OVER MY BROCCOLI!

04:31.572 --> 04:34.975
WHAT A DELICIOUS MISTAKE!

04:35.008 --> 04:37.511
AW, I'M SORRY, ADAM.

04:37.545 --> 04:40.314
I MEANT TO GET IT
ON YOUR FACE!

04:42.483 --> 04:46.454
HO HO! BOOM ON
THROWIN' PUDDIN' HERE!

04:46.487 --> 04:48.922
OH, LOOK!
CHASE AND PUDDING!

04:48.956 --> 04:50.624
I HADN'T THOUGHT OF
THAT COMBO!

04:53.427 --> 04:55.663
BREE, YOU ARE GOIN' DOWN.

04:55.696 --> 04:58.298
BRING IT!
ADAM, PULL MY HOOPS!

04:59.567 --> 05:01.669
HEY! HEY, HEY, HEY!

05:01.702 --> 05:05.639
STOP! I REALLY
NEED THIS WEEKEND
TO GO WELL FOR ME.

05:05.673 --> 05:07.608
CHILL OUT, LEO.
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

05:07.641 --> 05:09.910
WE'RE JUST HAVING
A LITI'M NOT.

05:09.943 --> 05:12.580
IF DAVENPORT TRUSTS ME
TO STAY HOME ALONE,

05:12.613 --> 05:14.782
THEN NEXT HE'LL GIVE ME
A PROJECT IN THE LAB,

05:14.815 --> 05:16.850
AND THEN HE'LL LET ME
GO ON A MISSION WITH YOU.

05:16.884 --> 05:18.952
DON'T YOU WANT ME TO
GO ON MISSIONS WITH YOU?

05:18.986 --> 05:21.021
NOT SO MUCH.

05:22.590 --> 05:24.792
OKAY, THAT'S IT.
NO MORE CRAZY FOODS,

05:24.825 --> 05:26.527
NO MORE PRANKING DAVENPORT,

05:26.560 --> 05:29.029
AND NO MORE BREAKING YOUR CURFEW
TO GO TO NEW YORK.

05:29.062 --> 05:30.598
JERSEY!

05:30.631 --> 05:32.500
WHATEVER.

05:32.533 --> 05:35.302
THIS GUY,
WHAT A NUDGE.

05:35.335 --> 05:40.641
JUST GET IN YOUR CAPSULES
AND GO TO SLEEP.

05:40.674 --> 05:43.677
I'LL TURN ON A NIGHTLIGHT
FOR YOU.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.913
( whirring )

05:45.946 --> 05:48.081
OHHH!

05:48.115 --> 05:50.951
EW! IT FEELS LIKE
MY STOMACH JUST POPPED!

05:50.984 --> 05:52.820
CAN I LEAVE MY DOOR OPEN
A CRACK?

05:52.853 --> 05:54.455
NO.

05:54.488 --> 05:56.524
ALL RIGHT, BUT IT MIGHT
BLOW OPEN BY ITSELF.

06:00.394 --> 06:04.765
THAT SUNSET
WAS SOYEAH.TIFUL.

06:04.798 --> 06:08.836
EVERYTHING LOOKS BETTER
OUT THE WINDOW OF
YOUR OWN PRIVATE JET.

06:08.869 --> 06:12.673
YOU KNOW, IF I WASN'T
SO ACCOMPLISHED, I'D PROBABLY
SOUND LIKE A JERK.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.776
OH, NO, HONEY.
YOU DO SOUND LIKE A JERK.

06:18.579 --> 06:21.882
OH, NO. I THINK I FORGOT
TO UNPLUG THE LEMP.

06:21.915 --> 06:23.684
I BETTER CALL HOME.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.119
YOU ARE JUST MAKING UP WORDS
SO THAT YOU CAN CHECK
ON THE KIDS.

06:26.153 --> 06:30.891
"THE LEMP"? WHERE'S THAT,
ON THE TOBLE NEXT TO THE BID?

06:30.924 --> 06:33.827
THE LEMP IS A LOCALIZED
ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSE.

06:33.861 --> 06:35.729
I THINK I LEFT IT
ON THE CONSOLE
IN THE LAB.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.931
DON'T YOU MEAN "THE LEB"?
( laughs )

06:37.965 --> 06:40.601
IT'S NOT FUNNY.
IF ONE OF THOSE KIDS
TURNS IT ON,

06:40.634 --> 06:43.103
IT COULD FRY EVERY
ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT
IN THE WHOLE HOUSE.

06:43.136 --> 06:45.573
IT'S LATE.
DON'T CALL AND WAKE THEM UP.

06:45.606 --> 06:48.642
BESIDES, IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG,
EDDIE WILL CALL US.

06:48.676 --> 06:51.645
Eddie: UNLESS I STOWED AWAY
 ON YOUR TABLET.

06:51.679 --> 06:53.747
I STOWED AWAY
 ON YOUR TABLET!

06:53.781 --> 06:56.083
I'M ON VAY-CAY!
 LET'S PARTY!

06:56.116 --> 06:58.418
CAN I GET A "WHOOP WHOOP"?

07:05.025 --> 07:07.995
( LEMP beeping )

07:09.997 --> 07:12.666
( whirring )

07:20.741 --> 07:22.710
( alarm wailing )

07:24.444 --> 07:26.780
( whimpering )

07:31.885 --> 07:34.688
( whistling carefree tune )

07:36.657 --> 07:38.792
GOOD MORN--AAAHH!

07:38.826 --> 07:40.994
Chase: LEO?

07:41.028 --> 07:42.863
LEO? IS THAT YOU?

07:42.896 --> 07:46.066
WHAT HAPPENED?!
ALL I DID WAS GO TO SLEEP!

07:46.099 --> 07:50.704
LEO, SOMETHING
HAPPENED TO MY VISION.
I CAN ONLY SEE PIXELS.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.877
I'M OKAY.

07:58.712 --> 08:01.114
BUDDY UP WHAT'S.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.650
HE SOUNDS DIFFERENT.

08:02.683 --> 08:05.085
YEAH, THAT'S 'CAUSE
HE CAN ONLY SPEAK BACKWARDS.

08:05.118 --> 08:07.555
IT WAS FUN FOR ABOUT
THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES--

08:07.588 --> 08:09.723
NOW I JUST WANT TO
RIP HIS HEAD OFF.

08:10.891 --> 08:12.159
WAIT.

08:12.192 --> 08:13.761
WAIT, WHERE'S BREE?

08:13.794 --> 08:17.464
AND IF YOU SAY
SHE WENT TO PARIS
FOR CREPES,

08:17.497 --> 08:19.900
I'M GONNA LOSE IT!

08:19.933 --> 08:21.535
I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE IS.

08:21.569 --> 08:23.470
SOMETHING WOKE US UP
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,

08:23.503 --> 08:26.073
SHE STARTED BOUNCING
AROUND THE ROOM LIKE A PINBALL,

08:26.106 --> 08:28.809
AND I HAVEN'T SEEN HER SINCE.

08:28.842 --> 08:32.511
I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING SINCE.

08:32.546 --> 08:34.782
I'M GONNA--ALL RIGHT.
OKAY. OKAY, I'M GONNA--

08:34.815 --> 08:37.717
I'M GONNA CALL HER
AND I'M GONNA GET HER BACK.

08:39.052 --> 08:40.688
( computer dials )

08:40.721 --> 08:42.756
Leo: BREE! NO!

08:42.789 --> 08:44.825
PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
YOU'VE GONE BACK IN TIME.

08:44.858 --> 08:47.761
NO! I JUST WOKE UP
 AND STARTED RUNNING.

08:47.795 --> 08:49.997
THE NEXT THING I KNEW,
 I WAS IN THE MIDDLE
 OF THE DESERT,

08:50.030 --> 08:54.668
MY FEET WERE SMOKING,
 AND MY NAVIGATION SYSTEM
 WAS ALL GOOFED UP.

08:54.702 --> 08:57.204
MY PHONE'S ABOUT TO DIE!
 WHAT AM I GONNA DO...

08:57.237 --> 08:58.672
BREE! BREE!

08:58.706 --> 08:59.740
OH-UH.

09:01.842 --> 09:05.879
GUYS, A LITTLE HELP HERE,
PLEASE.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.916
OKAY. OKAY.

09:08.949 --> 09:11.819
ALL RIGHT, AND...
THERE YOU GO, BUDDY.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.086
UHHHH!

09:13.120 --> 09:14.988
HA HA HA HA!

09:18.025 --> 09:20.894
THE KIDS SHOULD
BE UP BY NOW.

09:20.928 --> 09:25.933
AND IF THEY'RE NOT,
IT'LL BE MY DISTINCT PLEASURE
TO WAKE THEM UP.

09:25.966 --> 09:29.703
WHAT THE HECK IS THAT?!

09:29.737 --> 09:33.240
WELL, IT'S EITHER
MR. DAVENPORT'S RADON GAS ALARM,

09:33.273 --> 09:35.676
OR IT'S HIS EMERGENCY PHONE.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.945
AND BEING THAT NONE OF US
HAVE PASSED OUT YET,

09:37.978 --> 09:40.914
IT'S HIS EMERGENCY PHONE!!!

09:40.948 --> 09:42.816
( loud beeping )

09:42.850 --> 09:44.685
OH--NO--
HEY. HEY.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.757
DAVENPORT INDUSTRIES,
HOME OF THE LITTLE MAN'S
BIG DREAMS.

09:49.790 --> 09:52.192
LEO SPEAKING.
HOW MAY I HELP YOU?

09:52.225 --> 09:54.795
LEO! WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:54.828 --> 09:57.765
NOT A THING. WATCHING CARTOONS,
EATING CEREAL. YOU KNOW,
SATURDAY MORNING THINGS.

09:57.798 --> 10:01.034
CARTOONS WATCH WANT TO I!

10:01.068 --> 10:04.171
WAS THAT ADAM?
LET ME TALK TO HIM.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.640
UM...NO,

10:06.674 --> 10:07.808
IT'S THE TV.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.877
I'M WATCHING CAPTAIN BACKWARDS.

10:09.910 --> 10:11.712
HE SAVES THE DAY
IN THE BEGINNING AND...

10:11.745 --> 10:13.380
DOES ALL THE BORING STUFF
AT THE END.

10:14.882 --> 10:18.686
IT'S A TERRIBLE SHOW.
I DON'T KNOW WHY I WATCH IT.

10:18.719 --> 10:22.322
WHAT ABOUT BREE?
IS SHE AROUND?

10:22.355 --> 10:25.826
NO. YOU KNOW GIRLS.
SHE'S KNEE-DEEP IN
MAKEUP AND UNICORNS.

10:25.859 --> 10:29.096
(whispers)
What am I saying?!

10:29.129 --> 10:31.732
LOOK, LEO, I NEED YOU
TO DO ME A FAVOR.

10:31.765 --> 10:34.868
I NEED YOU TO UNPLUG THE LEMP
ON THE CONSOLE.

10:34.902 --> 10:37.204
( snickering )
"LEMP."

10:37.237 --> 10:41.341
OH. YOU MEAN...
THE NIGHTLIGHT?

10:41.374 --> 10:43.643
IT'S NOT A NIGHTLIGHT.

10:43.677 --> 10:46.013
IT'S A LOCALIZED
ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSE.

10:46.046 --> 10:48.849
PLEASE TELL ME
YOU DID NOT TURN IT ON.

10:48.882 --> 10:51.719
( LEMPNO.mming )

10:51.752 --> 10:54.321
NO, I DID NOT. UM...

10:56.089 --> 10:59.192
I SHOULD GO.
TELL MY MOMMY I LOVE HER.

10:59.226 --> 11:01.762
OH, I WILL. OKAY.

11:01.795 --> 11:03.130
WHAT DID HE SAY?

11:03.163 --> 11:06.166
HE SAID,
"TELL MY MOMMY I LOVE HER."

11:06.199 --> 11:10.170
HE SAID "MOMMY"?
HE'S HIDING SOMETHING.
TURN THIS PLANE AROUND.

11:10.203 --> 11:12.639
TURN THIS PLANE
AROUND!!!

11:12.672 --> 11:14.407
LEO! WE ARE COMING HOME

11:14.441 --> 11:16.910
RIGHT NOW!

11:16.944 --> 11:18.946
( disconnects )

11:21.749 --> 11:23.817
THEY'RE COMING HOME RIGHT NOW.

11:23.851 --> 11:25.052
WHAT?!

11:25.085 --> 11:28.922
"TELL MY MOMMY
I LOVE HER"?

11:28.956 --> 11:32.159
I'M SORRY. WHEN I FREAK OUT,
I TALK BABY TALK.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.862
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I'M GONNA GO UPSTAIRS

11:34.895 --> 11:37.697
TO TAKE A NIGHT-NIGHT
WITH MY BINKY.

11:41.401 --> 11:44.337
LEO, HOW COULD YOU
TURN ON THE LEMP?!

11:44.371 --> 11:46.073
IT'S A GIANT GLITCH MACHINE!

11:46.106 --> 11:48.341
THAT'S WHAT
GOOFED US ALL UP!

11:48.375 --> 11:50.377
OHHHH.

11:52.746 --> 11:57.885
SO THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS
THAT DAVENPORT TALKS ABOUT
WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO TOUCH?

11:57.918 --> 12:01.054
GOOD TO KNOW...
GOOD TO KNOW.

12:03.223 --> 12:06.960
LOOK, WE HAVE TO FIX THIS
BEFORE THEY GET HOME.

12:06.994 --> 12:10.430
I'LL LOCATE BREE'S SIGNAL
AND SEND HER THE COORDINATES
SO SHE CAN FIND HER WAY BACK.

12:10.463 --> 12:12.199
I THOUGHT
YOU COULDN'T SEE.

12:12.232 --> 12:16.403
OH, LEO.
GENIUS HAS NO BOUNDARIES.

12:16.436 --> 12:19.773
WELL, IT'S GOOD TO SEE
THAT YOUR LACK OF SIGHT

12:19.807 --> 12:24.344
HASN'T TAKEN AWAY FROM
YOUR SENSE OF SUPERIORITY.

12:24.377 --> 12:26.413
( beeping )

12:26.446 --> 12:28.715
OH, GOOD,
IT'S FLASHING
"SIGNAL RECEIVED."

12:28.748 --> 12:30.851
BUT WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
ABOUT YOU GUYS?

12:30.884 --> 12:35.322
WELL, MR. DAVENPORT DID
INSTALL AN EMERGENCY VIDEO FILE
ON MY INTERNAL HARD DRIVE.

12:35.355 --> 12:38.058
BUT WE'RE ONLY SUPPOSED TO
WATCH IT IN AN EMERGENCY.

12:38.091 --> 12:41.394
OH, UP WAKE!
EMERGENCY IT IS THIS!

12:46.266 --> 12:48.969
Donald:
 SO IF YOU'RE WATCHING THIS,

12:49.002 --> 12:53.006
I MUST HAVE GONE TO THAT
 BIG HARD DRIVE IN THE SKY.

12:55.876 --> 12:59.079
HOW COULD THIS
 HAVE HAPPENED?!
 I WAS SO YOUNG!

12:59.112 --> 13:00.981
( crying )
 LOOK AT ME!

13:01.014 --> 13:05.285
I WAS SO BEAUTIFUL
 AND TALENTED AND SMART...

13:05.318 --> 13:07.754
THIS IS AWFUL!

13:07.787 --> 13:11.758
RIGHT ABOUT NOW
I'M SORT OF GLAD
I CAN'T SEE THIS.

13:11.791 --> 13:15.863
IS THAT REALLY WHAT HE WORE
TO SAY HIS FINAL FAREWELL?

13:15.896 --> 13:20.067
SLAP ON A SUIT, DUDE!
YOU'RE ON A STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN!

13:20.100 --> 13:24.104
NOW, YOU'RE PROBABLY IN CRISIS,
 SO FIRST THINGS FIRST.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.907
IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO
 HAVE ME CRYOGENICALLY FROZEN,

13:26.940 --> 13:30.043
JUST CHUCK ME IN THE FRIDGE
 FOR NOW, IT'LL HAVE TO DO.

13:30.077 --> 13:32.579
DON'T YOU LET HIM
NEAR MY COLD CUTS!

13:35.082 --> 13:37.450
OH, AND, UH,
 I WOULD LIKE YOU TO PLAY

13:37.484 --> 13:40.921
MY SUPER FUNERAL MIX
 AT MY SERVICE.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.291
ALSO, MONEY IS NO OBJECT,

13:44.324 --> 13:46.894
SO I'D LIKE
 A SUPER-HUGE BLOW-OUT,

13:46.927 --> 13:50.063
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING BEFITTING
 A MAN AS AWESOME AS I...

13:50.097 --> 13:52.099
WAS.

13:57.070 --> 14:00.340
I'M SORRY. YOU GUYS
 MUST MISS ME SO MUCH!

14:02.442 --> 14:05.145
IS THERE A FAST-FORWARD?

14:05.178 --> 14:08.015
YEAH. THERE ARE
DIFFERENT CHAPTERS.

14:08.048 --> 14:11.118
OKAY, SEARCHING,
SEARCHING, SEARCHING...

14:11.151 --> 14:12.385
STOP!
THERE IT IS.

14:17.190 --> 14:20.894
WELL, THAT'S EERILY SPECIFIC.

14:20.928 --> 14:23.163
GET INTO THE MIDDLE CAPSULE
 WITH BARE FEET

14:23.196 --> 14:25.899
AND PRESS YOUR HANDS AGAINST
 THE SIDES OF THE CYLINDER.

14:25.933 --> 14:28.201
THIS CONNECTS THE CIRCUIT,
 INITIATES A REBOOT,

14:28.235 --> 14:30.203
AND WILL REPAIR ALL THE DAMAGE.

14:30.237 --> 14:34.007
OKAY. ONCE I RESTORE
MY SETTINGS, WE CAN
GET THINGS BACK TO NORMAL

14:34.041 --> 14:36.076
BEFORE TASHA AND DAVENPORT
GET HOME.

14:36.109 --> 14:39.246
AND THEY'LL NEVER KNOW
 HOW THOROUGHLY AND COMPLETELY
 YOU MESSED UP.

14:44.251 --> 14:45.652
( video powers down )

14:55.963 --> 14:59.132
( loud humming )

14:59.166 --> 15:02.069
( whooshing )

15:02.102 --> 15:04.471
WHERE AM I?

15:04.504 --> 15:06.206
WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE?!

15:06.239 --> 15:07.941
OH, GREAT!

15:07.975 --> 15:11.244
HA! JUST KIDDING.
YOU'RE NEXT.

15:11.278 --> 15:13.613
LUCK ME WISH.

15:15.915 --> 15:19.119
IF HE'S GONNA TAKE
HIS SHOES OFF, WE MIGHT
WANT TO TAKE A STEP BACK.

15:21.688 --> 15:24.958
( humming, whooshing )

15:26.459 --> 15:29.029
WHOO!
I THINK I'M OKAY.

15:29.062 --> 15:32.132
WAIT, MY VOICE ISN'T
COMING OUT OF MY BUTT,
IS IT?

15:33.566 --> 15:35.035
AND HE'S BACK.

15:39.239 --> 15:42.342
OKAY, EVERYTHING'S CLEANED UP.
NOW ALL WE NEED IS BREE.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.644
NO PROBLEM.
I'M TRACKING HER RIGHT NOW.

15:44.677 --> 15:47.514
ACCORDING TO THIS,
SHE SHOULD BE HERE
ANY MINUTE.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.616
THAT TOOK FOREVER.

15:49.649 --> 15:52.252
MY PHONE DIED,
AND I HAD TO BUY A MAP--

15:52.285 --> 15:54.554
A PAPER MAP.

15:54.587 --> 15:58.191
I MEAN, DO YOU KNOW
HOW HARD IT IS TO
FOLD THIS THING UP?

16:00.227 --> 16:03.363
A MAP? DIDN'T YOU GET
THE COORDINATES I SENT YOU?

16:03.396 --> 16:06.666
WHAT COORDINATES?
I DIDN'T GET ANY COORDINATES.

16:06.699 --> 16:09.602
WAIT. IF BREE'S HERE,
THEN WHAT ARE YOU TRACKING?

16:09.636 --> 16:13.206
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S PROBABLY JUST A BIRD.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.075
( beeping faster )

16:19.979 --> 16:26.219
OR NOT.

16:26.253 --> 16:30.223
GUYS, THIS IS ONE OF
MR. DAVENPORT'S DRONES.

16:30.257 --> 16:34.027
I MUST HAVE SENT IT
THE COORDINATES INSTEAD OF BREE!

16:34.061 --> 16:37.497
OH, YEAH. A GIANT
FLYING PIECE OF METAL
AND A TEENAGE GIRL--

16:37.530 --> 16:40.333
I SEE HOW YOU CAN
GET THAT MESSED UP.

16:40.367 --> 16:44.304
I MESSED IT UP
BECAUSE MY VISION
WAS IMPAIRED--

16:44.337 --> 16:47.640
BY YOU, MR. TOUCHY-STUFFY
MOMMY-MISSER.

16:49.276 --> 16:52.679
CHASE, LET'S NOT PLAY
THE BLAME GAME.

16:52.712 --> 16:57.350
GUYS, THIS DRONE CONTROLS
ALL OF MR. DAVENPORT'S
GPS TECHNOLOGY,

16:57.384 --> 17:01.288
INCLUDING THE PLANE THAT
HE'S FLYING ON RIGHT NOW.

17:01.321 --> 17:05.224
WHAT?! WHY WOULD HE
KEEP THE COMMAND CENTER
FOR ALL OF HIS TECHNOLOGY

17:05.258 --> 17:07.227
FLYING AROUND IN THE SKY?

17:07.260 --> 17:10.029
PROBABLY BECAUSE
 YOU'RE DOWN HERE.

17:14.567 --> 17:18.238
WHAT WAS I THINKING?
I KNEW LEO WASN'T READY
TO BE LEFT HOME ALONE.

17:18.271 --> 17:20.240
HOW COULD I LET YOU
TALK ME INTO THIS?

17:20.272 --> 17:22.342
YOU TALKED ME INTO THIS!

17:22.375 --> 17:25.545
DONALD, LET'S NOT
PLAY THE BLAME GAME.

17:25.578 --> 17:28.281
THIS IS SO WEIRD.

17:28.315 --> 17:30.250
I PROGRAMMED THE JET
TO TAKE US HOME,

17:30.283 --> 17:32.152
BUT IT'S NOT READING
THE COORDINATES FROM MY DRONE.

17:32.185 --> 17:33.386
I'M SORRY. YOUR WHAT?

17:33.420 --> 17:35.222
I HAVE AN ORBITING DRONE
THAT COORDINATES ALL OF MY--

17:35.255 --> 17:38.725
Eddie:
 DON'T BOTHER, DONNIE!
 SHE'LL NEVER BE ONE OF US!

17:38.758 --> 17:41.528
SHE'S DIAL-UP IN A 4G WORLD.

17:43.296 --> 17:46.666
ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT
WE ARE JUST RANDOMLY
FLYING AROUND RIGHT NOW,

17:46.699 --> 17:49.336
NO FLIGHT PLAN, NO PILOT?!

17:49.369 --> 17:51.471
GEE, TASHA,
 THIS SOUND PRETTY SERIOUS!

17:51.504 --> 17:54.374
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY JUMP OUT.

17:54.407 --> 17:57.410
UNLESS ONE OF MY OTHER COMPUTERS
TAKES THE CONTROLS

17:57.444 --> 17:58.811
AND LANDS THIS JET FOR ME.

17:58.845 --> 18:01.314
WAIT. HE'S GONNA
FLY THE PLANE FOR US?

18:01.348 --> 18:03.583
YOU HAVE GOT TO BE
KIDDING ME!

18:03.616 --> 18:07.354
BUCKLE UP, SUGAR.
 IT'S GONNA BE A BUMPY RIDE!

18:07.387 --> 18:09.589
EDDIE!!!

18:11.491 --> 18:14.327
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S THE LAST
OF THE BROKEN GLASS.

18:14.361 --> 18:16.796
AND THE DRONE IS FIXED.

18:16.829 --> 18:19.065
GO AHEAD, CHASE, HOP IN.

18:19.098 --> 18:22.335
HA HA! THAT'S A JOKE,
'CAUSE YOU'RE SO TINY.

18:22.369 --> 18:24.371
( laughing )

18:24.404 --> 18:27.807
YET MY BRAIN IS STILL
TWICE THE SIZE OF YOURS.

18:27.840 --> 18:30.743
OH, YEAH? WELL...I-I--

18:30.777 --> 18:32.512
YEAH, YOU GOT ME.

18:34.581 --> 18:36.683
WE'LL DEAL WITH THAT LATER.

18:36.716 --> 18:39.352
LET'S FOCUS ON GETTING ADAM
AND THE DRONE OUTSIDE

18:39.386 --> 18:42.355
SO WE CAN LAUNCH IT
OFF THE ROOF
AND BACK INTO THE SKY.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.460
THEY'RE WALKING UP
THE DRIVEWAY!

18:47.494 --> 18:49.696
THEY ARE WALKING
UP THE DRIVEWAY!!!

18:52.365 --> 18:54.401
Eddie: WELL, TASHA,
 LOOKS LIKE

18:54.434 --> 18:57.270
THE STUPID COMPUTER
 GOT YOU HOME SAFE!

18:57.304 --> 18:59.439
GUESS IT'S TIME
 TO GO BACK IN THE WALL.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.774
OH! HERE, LET ME HELP.

19:01.808 --> 19:04.411
AAAH!

19:04.444 --> 19:08.381
WELL, IT CERTAINLY HAS
BEEN A JOY TRAVELING
WITH YOU TWO.

19:11.318 --> 19:13.553
Eddie:
 YOU ARE ON THE LIST, CUPCAKE!

19:13.586 --> 19:14.821
OKAY!!!

19:17.224 --> 19:20.360
HEY, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
THE HOUSE IS IN ONE PIECE.

19:20.393 --> 19:22.729
WELCOME HOME, MOMMY.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.831
OKAY...

19:24.864 --> 19:27.200
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS UP TO?

19:27.234 --> 19:28.901
JUST CHILLIN'. YA KNOW.

19:28.935 --> 19:32.439
WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
NOTHING HAPPENED.
NOTHING AT ALL.

19:32.472 --> 19:35.475
YOU TWO--
ALWAYS SO SUSPICIOUS.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.513
HMM.

19:40.547 --> 19:43.316
I DON'T SMELL ANY FIRES...

19:43.350 --> 19:45.618
AND NO ONE'S IN
A FULL BODY CAST.

19:45.652 --> 19:47.254
WAIT--WHERE'S ADAM?

19:47.287 --> 19:50.390
ADAM? UH, ADAM IS...

19:50.423 --> 19:55.395
RIGHT HERE WARMING UP
YOUR WELCOME HOME HUGS.
BRING IT IN, PEOPLES!

19:55.428 --> 19:57.930
OOH! OKAY.

20:00.400 --> 20:04.170
WELL, I GUESS
WE OVERREACTED.

20:04.203 --> 20:07.574
RIGHT. I WILL GO RESCHEDULE
OUR TRIP TO AUSTRALIA.

20:07.607 --> 20:11.511
THIS TIME ON A BIG PLANE
WITH AN ACTUAL PILOT.

20:11.544 --> 20:14.347
WHAT IS THAT?

20:14.381 --> 20:15.448
( crashing )

20:19.552 --> 20:22.589
BY THE WAY, WE FORGOT
TO RESET THE COORDINATES.

20:22.622 --> 20:25.458
RESET THE COORDINATES?!

20:27.327 --> 20:29.696
IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY

20:29.729 --> 20:31.698
TOUCHED MY STUFF!!!

20:34.734 --> 20:36.403
MOMMY.

20:43.643 --> 20:47.580
SO NOTHING ELSE HAPPENED
WHILE I WAS GONE?

20:47.614 --> 20:49.616
NO. JUST THE DRONE THING.

20:49.649 --> 20:52.319
YEP, JUST THAT
DRONE THING.

20:54.287 --> 20:56.923
JUST THE DRONE THING.

20:56.956 --> 20:59.726
AHH. ANYBODY WANT TO
SEE A SLIDE SHOW?

20:59.759 --> 21:01.561
OOH! IS IS AUSTRALIA?

21:01.594 --> 21:03.430
NO! HA HA!

21:03.463 --> 21:07.534
IT'S MY SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS
THAT SHOW EVERYBODY'S MOVEMENTS

21:07.567 --> 21:09.502
THROUGHOUT
THE ENTIRE HOUSE.

21:09.536 --> 21:13.640
"HUH. I NEVER THOUGHT OF
USING MY PRICELESS GUITAR
AS A HAMMER."

21:13.673 --> 21:17.644
"HEY, WHAT HAPPENS IF
I STICK MY HEAD IN HERE?"

21:17.677 --> 21:21.013
"NOW THAT MY HAIR'S BIG,
I CAN GET ON ALL THE RIDES!"

21:21.047 --> 21:24.784
"HERE WE ARE EXPLORING
THE DEEP, DARK WATERS
OF IDIOCY."

21:24.817 --> 21:27.754
HA HA HA!
HEH...

21:29.622 --> 21:32.625
SO...

21:32.659 --> 21:36.329
SO YOU'RE ALL GROUNDED--
FOREVER!

21:36.363 --> 21:38.565
HA HA HA HA
HA HA HA HA!
