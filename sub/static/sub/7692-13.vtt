00:04.205 --> 00:07.208
**

00:12.012 --> 00:14.748
UGH. OKAY. TOILET'S CLEAN.

00:14.782 --> 00:16.984
BATHTUB'S CLEAN,
SINK IS CLEAN.

00:17.017 --> 00:20.288
AND MAY I JUST SAY,
YOU PEOPLE ARE DISGUSTING.

00:20.321 --> 00:22.590
HERE IS YOUR CHORE MONEY.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.227
SWEET!

00:26.260 --> 00:28.396
I HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO SEE
THE NEW PIG ZOMBIE MOVIE

00:28.429 --> 00:30.198
AND GET A T-SHIRT.

00:30.231 --> 00:33.334
PIG ZOMBIE: CRUISE
 SHIP MASSACRE IN 3-D.

00:33.367 --> 00:36.104
HUNGRY HOGS ON THE HIGH SEAS.

00:36.137 --> 00:38.539
LEO, I DON'T WANT YOU
WASTING YOUR BRAIN,

00:38.572 --> 00:41.275
YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME
ON THAT TRASH.

00:41.309 --> 00:43.077
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SEE
PIG ZOMBIES.

00:43.111 --> 00:44.112
END OF DISCUSSION.

00:44.145 --> 00:45.279
UH-UH.UT--

00:45.313 --> 00:47.047
MMMMRPH!

00:47.081 --> 00:50.284
GLAD TO SEE WE WERE ABLE
TO TALK THIS OUT.

00:52.120 --> 00:54.021
LEO, I KNOW YOU WANT
TO BE A SUPERHERO,

00:54.054 --> 00:56.090
BUT THAT'S THE WORST
COSTUME EVER.

00:56.124 --> 00:59.427
I WAS CLEANING THE BATHROOM,

00:59.460 --> 01:02.530
SO I COULD GET SOME MONEY
TO SEE MY FAVORITE MOVIE.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.665
BUT SOMEONE WHO SHALL
REMAIN NAMELESS...

01:07.368 --> 01:09.437
WON'T LET ME GO.

01:09.470 --> 01:10.771
WAIT A MINUTE.

01:10.804 --> 01:13.374
YOU GET PAID MONEY
JUST FOR CLEANING STUFF?

01:13.407 --> 01:14.808
OH, YEAH.
MOST KIDS HAVE CHORES.

01:14.842 --> 01:16.544
YOU CLEAN THINGS
AROUND THE HOUSE,

01:16.577 --> 01:18.646
AND THEN YOU GET AN ALLOWANCE
FROM YOUR PARENTS.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.414
I WANT MONEY!!

01:20.448 --> 01:21.715
OH, I WANT A BIG
FURRY HAT

01:21.749 --> 01:23.351
SO I CAN WEAR IT
TO SCARE ANIMALS.

01:24.818 --> 01:26.787
YOU GUYS CAN
FINISH MY CHORES.

01:26.820 --> 01:29.056
THERE'S NO REASON
FOR ME TO HAVE MONEY

01:29.089 --> 01:32.293
SINCE MISS SPANK-MANAGER
PUT A FREEZE ON MY FUN ACCOUNT.

01:34.428 --> 01:35.429
SO WHERE SHOULD WE START?

01:35.463 --> 01:36.697
JUST LOOK AROUND THE HOUSE

01:36.730 --> 01:39.533
AND SEE WHAT NEEDS
TO BE CLEANED.

01:39.567 --> 01:42.203
I GOT THIS.

01:50.578 --> 01:54.348
OH! THAT'S WHERE I LEFT
MY LUCKY FLOSS!

01:57.585 --> 02:00.120
IF YOU USE THAT,
I WILL HURL.

02:00.154 --> 02:03.157
AND THEN I WILL CLEAN UP
THAT HURL. KA-CHING!

02:28.682 --> 02:30.218
PERFECT!

02:30.251 --> 02:32.220
( ding )

02:32.253 --> 02:33.754
YOU COULD EAT OFF
OF THIS FLOOR.

02:33.787 --> 02:36.890
COULD, CAN, AND WILL.

02:39.593 --> 02:42.863
WOW. YOU GUYS JUST DID
A DAY'S WORTH OF CHORES

02:42.896 --> 02:44.665
IN THREE MINUTES.

02:44.698 --> 02:46.734
YOU KNOW, IF THIS WHOLE MISSION
THING DOESN'T WORK OUT,

02:46.767 --> 02:48.469
I CAN BUY A MINIVAN,

02:48.502 --> 02:50.471
AND WE CAN OPEN UP
A CLEANING SERVICE.

02:50.504 --> 02:55.309
HERE YOU GO.

02:55.343 --> 02:59.247
OH, MAMA JUST GOT A NEW
PAIR OF SHOES.

02:59.280 --> 03:04.452
I AM NOW WORTH SEVEN DOLLARS.

03:04.485 --> 03:07.388
I WISH I KNEW HOW TO COUNT.

03:07.421 --> 03:11.892
JUST MAKE SURE YOU ALL SPEND
YOUR MONEY RESPONSIBLY.

03:11.925 --> 03:15.696
OH! HEY, GUYS.
I GOT MY NEW SPRAY-ON JEANS!

03:22.503 --> 03:25.205
HOW IS THAT RESPONSIBLE
SPENDING?

03:25.239 --> 03:27.241
27 PAIRS IN ONE CAN.

03:27.275 --> 03:28.442
THAT'S ONE FOR EVERY DAY
OF THE MONTH.

03:30.844 --> 03:33.681
Narrator:
 THE WORLD'S FIRST
 BIONIC SUPERHUMANS.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.649
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN US,

03:35.683 --> 03:37.718
FASTER, SMARTER--

03:37.751 --> 03:40.354
THE NEXT GENERATION
 OF THE HUMAN RACE IS...

03:40.388 --> 03:42.623
LIVING IN MY BASEMENT?

03:42.656 --> 03:45.859
**

04:18.392 --> 04:19.927
**

04:19.959 --> 04:22.296
HEY, GUYS.

04:22.330 --> 04:23.964
THE NEIGHBORS ARE SELLING THEIR
STUFF IN THE FRONT YARD.

04:23.997 --> 04:25.499
I SPENT MY LAST FIVE BUCKS

04:25.533 --> 04:27.901
ON THIS WHOLE BASKET
OF USED SOCKS!

04:27.935 --> 04:29.870
YOU DON'T EVEN WEAR SOCKS.

04:29.903 --> 04:33.273
HELLO? SOCK PUPPETS.

04:33.307 --> 04:35.275
I SPENT MY CHORE MONEY

04:35.309 --> 04:38.312
STARTING MY HIDEOUS BABIES
COLLECTION.

04:38.346 --> 04:41.248
HERE'S LIP-SORE LIZZY,

04:41.281 --> 04:43.384
PINK-EYE PEGGY,

04:43.417 --> 04:47.888
AND LIMITED EDITION
TRIPLE-CHIN CHUCK.

04:47.921 --> 04:49.690
WHAT'D YOU BUY, CHASE?

04:49.723 --> 04:52.526
I BOUGHT FINANCIAL SECURITY.

04:52.560 --> 04:53.894
THAT'S RIGHT.

04:53.927 --> 04:56.830
JUST ME AND MY MONEY
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

04:58.432 --> 05:00.300
I'M SAVING EVERY LAST DOLLAR.

05:00.334 --> 05:03.971
FRIENDS COME AND GO,
BUT MONEY IS FOREVER.

05:05.906 --> 05:07.875
HEY, GUYS. HOW'S IT GOING?

05:07.908 --> 05:09.577
GREAT, NOW THAT YOU'RE BACK.

05:09.610 --> 05:12.012
MONEY, MONEY, MONEY, MONEY,
MONEY, MONEY, MONEY.

05:15.015 --> 05:16.550
IS SOMEONE COOKING BACON?

05:16.584 --> 05:17.885
OH, TURKEY BACON.

05:17.918 --> 05:20.721
I'M COOKING IT
IN MY NEW BACON PACK.

05:20.754 --> 05:22.956
IT'S A BACON COOKER!

05:22.990 --> 05:25.726
ON MY BACK IN A PACK
IN CASE I WANNA SNACK.

05:27.595 --> 05:29.797
I'M GLAD YOU GUYS
ALL LOVE YOUR CHORES

05:29.830 --> 05:31.432
BUT YOU ALREADY
DID EVERYTHING.

05:31.465 --> 05:34.034
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO WAIT UNTIL NEXT WEEK.

05:34.067 --> 05:35.403
WHAT?

05:35.436 --> 05:36.870
NO, NO WAY.

05:36.904 --> 05:40.073
I'M DOWN TO MY LAST
TWO PAIRS OF SPRAY-ON JEANS.

05:40.107 --> 05:41.942
AND I HAVE TO GET
THAT DROOLING DEBBIE DOLL.

05:41.975 --> 05:44.077
SHE'S PART OF A SET
WITH BARFY BETTY.

05:46.747 --> 05:49.517
HOW CUTE IS SHE?

05:51.652 --> 05:53.721
NOW, NOW, NOW.

05:53.754 --> 05:56.323
IF ONLY YOU HAD
SAVED YOUR MONEY.

05:56.356 --> 05:59.326
YOU'D BE FEELING AS SECURE AS--
OH, WHO AM I KIDDING?

05:59.359 --> 06:02.863
I NEED MORE MONEY TOO.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.331
WAIT A MINUTE.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.766
WHY DON'T WE JUST
SELL OUR THINGS

06:05.799 --> 06:07.468
LIKE THE NEIGHBORS DID?

06:07.501 --> 06:10.638
THERE IS PLENTY OF STUFF AROUND
HERE THAT NO ONE USES.

06:10.671 --> 06:12.740
WELL, YEAH, LIKE,

06:12.773 --> 06:15.008
THIS FIGURINE.

06:15.042 --> 06:18.479
OR THIS BOOK.

06:18.512 --> 06:20.614
OR THIS PILLOW.

06:20.648 --> 06:21.749
HEY, I USE THAT.

06:21.782 --> 06:22.916
FOR WHAT?

06:27.387 --> 06:28.856
WHAT? YOU ASKED.

06:32.059 --> 06:35.529
( music box plays, warbling )

06:35.563 --> 06:39.633
WISH WE COULD KEEP TASHA
 IN A BOX LIKE THAT.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.702
EDDIE, THIS IS A JEWELRY BOX

06:41.735 --> 06:43.637
THAT TASHA'S GRANDMOTHER
GAVE HER.

06:43.671 --> 06:47.675
IT'S BEEN BROKEN FOR YEARS,
AND I AM GOING TO RESTORE IT,

06:47.708 --> 06:49.142
AND SURPRISE HER WITH IT.

06:49.176 --> 06:50.878
YEAH. I'M PERFECT.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.146
OOH! IF YOU REALLY WANNA
 SURPRISE HER,

06:53.180 --> 06:56.584
LET'S SPLIT TOWN AND NOT LEAVE
 A FORWARDING ADDRESS.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.454
ONLY THING IS, I HAVE TO FIND
A PLACE TO HIDE IT

07:00.488 --> 07:02.022
WHERE SHE WON'T FIND IT.

07:02.055 --> 07:04.758
SHE GOES IN THERE.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.960
THERE TOO.

07:06.994 --> 07:08.696
WHA--

07:12.466 --> 07:16.069
THERE. NOW, EDDIE, DON'T TELL
ANYBODY ABOUT THIS, OKAY?

07:16.103 --> 07:18.506
YOU ACT LIKE I ENJOY
 CAUSING TROUBLE.

07:18.539 --> 07:19.940
OH, BY THE WAY,

07:19.973 --> 07:22.209
TASHA SAYS SHE WISHES
 YOU WERE TALLER.

07:23.977 --> 07:27.848
( loud groan )

07:30.718 --> 07:33.453
I'M GONNA GO OUT ON A LIMB
AND SAY SOMETHING'S WRONG.

07:33.487 --> 07:36.089
THE NEW PIG ZOMBIE MOVIE
COMES OUT THIS WEEKEND

07:36.123 --> 07:37.525
AND I CAN'T GO.

07:37.558 --> 07:40.561
WAIT, DID YOU SAY "PIG ZOMBIE?"

07:40.594 --> 07:42.696
THIS LITTLE PIGGY WENT HOME...

07:42.730 --> 07:44.565
Both:
TO EAT YOUR FACE!

07:44.598 --> 07:47.167
( screams )

07:47.200 --> 07:49.837
NO WAY! YOU LIKE PIG ZOMBIES?

07:49.870 --> 07:52.439
DO I BREATHE?
THEY'RE ONLY THE
GREATEST MOVIES

07:52.472 --> 07:54.608
IN THE HISTORY OF MOVIES
EVER MADE EVER.

07:54.642 --> 07:58.512
I KNOW! I MEMORIZED
EVERY LINE BY HEART.

07:58.546 --> 08:01.014
AND MY PSYCHOTIC PIG OINK
IS DEAD ON.

08:01.048 --> 08:02.750
( zombie squeal )

08:02.783 --> 08:05.819
FINALLY, I HAVE SOMEBODY TO
WATCH THESE MOVIES WITH.

08:05.853 --> 08:07.721
BREE HATES THEM.
ADAM'S SCARED OF THEM.

08:07.755 --> 08:09.657
AND CHASE ALWAYS
RUINS THEM WITH LOGIC.

08:09.690 --> 08:13.460
"A PIG CAN'T PEEL A BANANA,
A PIG CAN'T CRACK A SAFE."

08:13.493 --> 08:15.462
"A PIG CAN'T JUMP
AN 18-WHEELER

08:15.495 --> 08:17.497
OVER AN UNFINISHED
SECTION OF HIGHWAY."

08:17.531 --> 08:18.999
DUH, YOU JUST SAW IT HAPPEN.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.500
YOU JUST SAW IT HAPPEN!

08:20.534 --> 08:22.002
IT'S RIGHT THERE.

08:22.035 --> 08:24.004
WAIT, WHY CAN'T YOU GO
SEE THE NEW ONE?

08:24.037 --> 08:27.541
BECAUSE I--

08:27.575 --> 08:30.711
HAVE NO ONE TO TAKE ME.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.011
WELL YOU DO NOW.

08:32.044 --> 08:33.881
WE'LL GO SEE THE
NEW ONE ON FRIDAY

08:33.914 --> 08:35.716
AND THEN SUNDAY
WE'LL WATCH

08:35.749 --> 08:37.017
THE BIG PIG MARATHON ON TV.

08:37.049 --> 08:38.885
IT'LL BE OUR PIG ZOMBIE
PORKAPALOOZA.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.187
AWESOME!

08:40.220 --> 08:41.655
YOU THINK WE SHOULD
INVITE YOUR MOM?

08:41.688 --> 08:43.624
NO!

08:43.657 --> 08:45.225
WE SHOULD KEEP THIS
OUR LITTLE SECRET,

08:45.258 --> 08:48.762
'CAUSE SHE'S MORE INTO THE
VAMPIRE-COW FLICKS.

08:48.796 --> 08:50.764
YEAH, THOSEYEAH.GOOD THOUGH.

08:50.798 --> 08:53.000
I VANT TO CHEW YOUR CUD!

I'LL GIVE YOU HALF

THAT WAS THE
GREATEST MOVIE EVER.

10:27.895 --> 10:30.898
A PIG ON WATER SKIS?
I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING.

10:30.931 --> 10:32.766
OH, AND HOW ABOUT THE PART

10:32.800 --> 10:35.936
WHEN THE PIG DISGUISED HIMSELF
AS PART OF THE MIDNIGHT BUFFET?

10:35.969 --> 10:37.771
NO, NO, NO!
 STOP TALKING!

10:37.805 --> 10:41.008
DO YOU NOT KNOW THE PHRASE,
 "SPOILER ALERT?"

10:41.041 --> 10:43.777
OH, SORRY, EDDIE.
I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT
THE BIG SURPRISE ENDING

10:43.811 --> 10:46.113

I WOULD, BUT I HAVE
SOMETHING FUN TO DO.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.772
WAIT, WHERE'D IT GO?

11:11.805 --> 11:14.775
I HID IT RIGHT HERE
AND NOW IT'S GONE.

11:14.808 --> 11:17.644
( warbling )
 WELL, MAYBE SHE FOUND IT
 AND THREW IT IN THE TRASH,

11:17.677 --> 11:20.180
'CAUSE IT'S SUCH A CHEAP,
 LAME-O GIFT.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.983
EDDIE, TWO WORDS.
MUTE BUTTON.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.389
HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN
A JEWELRY BOX?

11:31.825 --> 11:35.395
IS IT A LITTLE
BROWN WOODEN ONE

11:35.428 --> 11:36.964

11:36.997 --> 11:39.933
HAVEN'T SEEN IT.

11:39.967 --> 11:41.802
NOPE, NOT ME.

11:41.835 --> 11:44.004
ME NEITHER, AG--AGAIN.

11:45.472 --> 11:46.807
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED TO IT.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.408
IT WAS TASHA'S GRANDMA'S.

11:48.441 --> 11:52.079
I WAS GONNA FIX IT FOR HER
AND SURPRISE HER WITH IT.

11:52.112 --> 11:53.446
IF YOU GUYS SEE IT,
JUST LET ME KNOW.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.382
SESEE--T?

11:55.415 --> 12:00.020
SEE, UH, THAT NEW REALITY
SHOW ABOUT THE DOG

12:00.053 --> 12:01.922
AND THE-- AND THE BEAR.

12:01.955 --> 12:05.158
THEY, UH, FALL IN LOVE
AND FIGHT CRIME. IT'S ADORABLE.

12:07.127 --> 12:08.829
IT'S ON TV RIGHT NOW.
LET'S GO WATCH IT.

12:12.165 --> 12:14.734
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE SOLD
TASHA'S JEWELRY BOX.

12:14.768 --> 12:17.070
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE
RUINED HIS SURPRISE.

12:17.104 --> 12:19.139
I CAN'T BELIEVE NO ONE
BOUGHT THIS PEANUT BUTTER.

12:22.142 --> 12:23.743
( gags )

12:23.777 --> 12:26.413
HUH. CHUNKY.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.451
EVERYTHING KEEPS
DISAPPEARING.

12:31.484 --> 12:35.956
I CAN'T FIND MY FAVORITE MUG,
ALL THE SPOONS ARE GONE.

12:35.989 --> 12:39.259
I HAD TO EAT MY BREAKFAST
CEREAL WITH A STEAK KNIFE.

12:39.292 --> 12:42.129
YEAH, I CAN'T FIND MY
PIG ZOMBIE T-SHIRT ANYWHERE.

12:42.162 --> 12:43.730
OH, THAT, I PUT
IN THE LAUNDRY

12:43.763 --> 12:45.833
SO IT'D BE FRESH
FOR TOMORROW'S MARATHON.

12:45.866 --> 12:48.035
WAIT, YOU PUT WHAT
IN THE WHO WITH WHERE NOW?

12:50.037 --> 12:51.905
MOM!

12:51.939 --> 12:55.142
OR SHOULD I SAY, DEAREST WOMAN
WHO CONSTANTLY SACRIFICES

12:55.175 --> 12:57.144
FOR MY HAPPINESS.

12:57.177 --> 13:01.014
LET ME FOLD THAT FOR YOU.
JUST FOLD THAT.

13:01.048 --> 13:03.216
LEO, IF I DIDN'T
KNOW ANY BETTER,

13:03.250 --> 13:06.253
I WOULD THINK YOU
WERE LOOKING FOR THIS!

13:08.088 --> 13:12.759
"I SURVIVED PIG ZOMBIE
3-D CRUISE SHIP MASSACRE."

13:12.792 --> 13:14.361
DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO TELL ME?

13:16.463 --> 13:17.764
THAT'S NOT MINE.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.066
EXTRA SMALL.

13:19.099 --> 13:20.968
YOU HAVE A TINY HUSBAND.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.272
I LOVE YOU?

13:32.345 --> 13:34.514
**

13:34.547 --> 13:36.416
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
WENT BEHIND MY BACK

13:36.449 --> 13:39.119
AND SAW THOSE FREAKY,
MONSTER PIG THINGS.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.421
AND LEO, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
LET ME TAKE YOU TO THE MOVIE

13:41.454 --> 13:43.323
WHEN YOUR MOM SAID NO.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.058
YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS?

13:45.092 --> 13:47.460
YEAH, BUT I HAD NO IDEA
YOU SAID HE COULDN'T GO

13:47.494 --> 13:51.564
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T TELL ME.

13:51.598 --> 13:53.500
SO YOU LIED TO BOTH OF US.

13:53.533 --> 13:57.871
OH, NO. I LIED TO HIM.
I DISOBEYED YOU.

14:00.207 --> 14:02.442
YOU'RE GROUNDED.
NO TV FOR A WEEK.

14:02.475 --> 14:05.312
I SPECIFICALLY TOLD YOU
NOT TO SEE THAT MOVIE.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.180
COME ON, THIS ISN'T FAIR.

14:07.214 --> 14:09.116
I DON'T LIKE HIGH-HEELED SHOES
AND LADY MAGAZINES,

14:09.149 --> 14:10.918
BUT I DON'T TELL YOU NOT TO BUY
THEM WITH YOUR MONEY.

14:14.321 --> 14:16.823
SORRY, I WAS JUST TRYING TO STOP
HIM BEFORE HE BURIED HIMSELF.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.092
BUT I WAS WAY TOO LATE.

14:20.961 --> 14:24.397
SO, THAT NEIGHBOR WHO
BOUGHT THE JEWELRY BOX

14:24.431 --> 14:25.432
AGREED TO SELL
IT BACK TO US.

14:25.465 --> 14:26.199
YES!

14:26.233 --> 14:27.467
FOR $200.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.937
YES! WAIT,
IS THAT MORE THAN 70?

14:31.404 --> 14:32.906
IT'S AN ANTIQUE,

14:32.940 --> 14:34.908
SO THAT'S HOW MUCH
HE'S SELLING IT FOR.

14:34.942 --> 14:36.843
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.112
WELL, WE COULD SELL
YOUR STUPID DOLLS.

14:39.146 --> 14:42.015
OR, WE COULD SELL
YOUR STUPID FACE,

14:42.049 --> 14:44.251
ALTHOUGH I DOUBT
ANYONE WOULD BUY IT.

14:44.284 --> 14:46.353
AND I'M NOT SELLING
MY BACON BACKPACK.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.121
NOT JUST BECAUSE
I'VE LOOKED EVERYWHERE

14:48.155 --> 14:49.622
AND I HAVE NO IDEA
WHERE I PUT IT.

14:51.658 --> 14:55.362
YOU KNOW, WE DON'T HAVE TO GIVE
UP OUR MONEY OR OUR THINGS

14:55.395 --> 14:58.465
IF CHASE COUGHED UP A FEW
BUCKS FROM HIS WRIST VAULT.

14:58.498 --> 15:00.233
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

15:00.267 --> 15:02.502
I DIDN'T SELL TASHA'S
JEWELRY BOX, ADAM DID.

15:02.535 --> 15:03.636
OH, I DIDN'T WANT TO SELL IT.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.572
I WANTED TO SELL
THE BUBBLE WRAP.

15:05.605 --> 15:08.241
WE ALL AGREED
TO HAVE A SALE.

15:08.275 --> 15:10.543
NOW GIVE US THE MONEY,
YOU GREEDY, LITTLE BRAT.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.312
NO, GET AWAY FROM ME.

15:12.345 --> 15:16.583
NO ONE IS GETTING NEAR
MY BEAUTIFUL BOX OF CASH.

15:17.985 --> 15:19.119
( loud whirr )

15:20.988 --> 15:23.123
HEY!

15:23.156 --> 15:25.258
I'LL TAKE SPEED
OVER SMARTS ANY DAY.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.494
( wind howls )

15:27.527 --> 15:29.429
( laughs )

15:29.462 --> 15:30.897
LOT OF GOOD THAT'LL DO HER.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.132
SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE KEY.

15:32.165 --> 15:33.967
AND NEITHER DO YOU.

15:40.573 --> 15:43.176
( groans )

15:43.210 --> 15:46.246
MUST...GET...THE MONEY!

15:48.415 --> 15:51.151
MUST...GET...THE KEY!

15:53.586 --> 15:55.622
THERE YOU ARE!

15:56.589 --> 15:58.558
AHA!

15:58.591 --> 16:00.593
GET HER!

16:00.627 --> 16:03.696
( both groan )

16:03.730 --> 16:05.632
GIVE ME BACK MY BRIEFCASE.

16:05.665 --> 16:06.466
NEVER!

16:06.499 --> 16:07.634
OKAY, THEN.

16:07.667 --> 16:10.403
( electricity crackling )

16:10.437 --> 16:11.938
( yells )

16:11.971 --> 16:14.307
HA! MAGNETISM APP.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.343
DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING,
DID YA?

16:16.376 --> 16:18.211
GET HIM!

16:22.449 --> 16:24.051
( laughs )

16:24.084 --> 16:26.686
TRY TO GET ME NOW.
IT'S LOCKED.

16:32.759 --> 16:35.162
OH, HE THINKS HE'S SO SMART?

16:35.195 --> 16:38.031
WE'LL JUST USE THE DRYER TO BLOW
THE MONEY OUT OF HIS HANDS.

16:38.065 --> 16:40.167
( keyboard beeps )

16:40.200 --> 16:43.436
( loud fan whirrs )

16:45.372 --> 16:48.441
NO, PLEASE!
COME BACK, OLD FRIENDS!

16:48.475 --> 16:50.210
COME BA-A-ACK!

16:50.243 --> 16:51.978
HA! YEAH!

16:52.011 --> 16:53.746
NOW LET'S SUCK THE MONEY
OUT BY REVERSING THE FAN.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.548
ADAM, NO!

16:58.151 --> 16:59.652
WE'VE GOT TO STOP IT!

17:01.388 --> 17:03.090
NO!

17:03.123 --> 17:04.557
NO!

17:04.590 --> 17:06.326
OH, YOU WERE LIKE,
ADAM, NO.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.560
YOU WERE LIKE, ADAM, NO.
THE FAN WILL SHRED THE MONEY.

17:08.595 --> 17:10.063
NOW I GET YA.

17:14.401 --> 17:17.002
LOOK AT YOU SHOWERING
IN YOUR MONEY.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.704
I PREFER TO BATHE IN MINE.

17:24.676 --> 17:29.116
ADAM AND BREE STOLE MY MONEY
AND TURNED IT INTO CONFETTI.

17:29.149 --> 17:31.384
I WAS JUST TRYING TO GET
CHASE'S MONEY

17:31.418 --> 17:32.452
TO BUY BACK
THE JEWELRY BOX

17:32.485 --> 17:34.721
THAT ADAM SOLD.

17:34.754 --> 17:37.357
THAT'S RIGHT.
CHASE'S MONEY.

17:37.390 --> 17:38.691
WHO'S MONEY?
CHASE'S MONEY.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.293
IT WAS MINE!
IS WAS ALL MINE!

17:40.327 --> 17:44.664
WHOA, BACK UP.
DID SOMEBODY SAY JEWELRY BOX?

17:44.697 --> 17:46.133
Both:
ADAM SOLD IT!

17:47.467 --> 17:49.802
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS
HAVE EXACTLY TWO SECONDS

17:49.836 --> 17:51.571
TO EXPLAIN WHAT'S GOING
ON STARTING NOW.

17:51.604 --> 17:52.805
WE SAW LEO HAD CHORES
AND EARNED MONEY,

17:52.839 --> 17:54.607
SO WE WANTED CHORES
TO GET MONEY,

17:54.641 --> 17:56.042
WE CLEANED THE WHOLE HOUSE,
THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT TO CLEAN,

17:56.075 --> 17:57.610
SO WE HAD NO CHORES
AND NO MONEY...

17:57.644 --> 17:59.446
( increasing dialogue speed )

17:59.479 --> 18:01.148
...AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

18:02.849 --> 18:06.553
WHAT? YOU SAID
TWO SECONDS.

18:06.586 --> 18:09.156
WE'RE SORRY,
MR. DAVENPORT.

18:09.189 --> 18:10.790
WE WERE DOING CHORES
TO MAKE MONEY

18:10.823 --> 18:12.259
BUT WE WANTED MORE MONEY.

18:12.292 --> 18:15.128
SO, WE HELD A YARD SALE.

18:15.162 --> 18:17.464
IN THE HOUSE.

18:18.865 --> 18:21.734
YOU LET PEOPLE
IN THE HOUSE?

18:21.768 --> 18:24.070
NOW, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
THINKING, BUT DON'T WORRY.

18:24.103 --> 18:27.740
ONLY ONE PERSON TOOK
A NAP IN YOUR BED.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.842
WHEN WE FOUND OUT THE JEWELRY
BOX WAS IMPORTANT,

18:29.876 --> 18:32.445
WE FOUGHT OVER ALL THE MONEY
JUST TO BUY IT BACK.

18:32.479 --> 18:34.614
HOW COULD YOU SELL
MY THINGS?

18:34.647 --> 18:35.848
OH, IT'S SUPER EASY.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.717
YOU JUST PUT SIGNS UP
AND PEOPLE GO NUTS.

18:37.750 --> 18:40.820
I MEAN, THEY SHOW UP
BEFORE YOU'RE EVEN READY.

18:40.853 --> 18:46.293
LOOK, GUYS, MONEY CAN MAKE
PEOPLE GREEDY AND SELFISH.

18:46.326 --> 18:48.161
I MEAN, I KNOW IT'S HARD
TO TELL LOOKING AT ME

18:48.195 --> 18:49.662
BECAUSE OVER THE YEARS
I'VE LEARNED TO HIDE IT

18:49.696 --> 18:52.465
WITH MY DEBONAIR
OUTER CHARM.

18:52.499 --> 18:54.601
WE CAN GET
THE JEWELRY BOX BACK

18:54.634 --> 18:56.836
WE JUST NEED $200.

18:56.869 --> 18:58.871
FOR THAT PIECE OF JUNK?

18:58.905 --> 19:02.309
I MEAN, UH,
THAT'S REASONABLE.

19:02.342 --> 19:05.245
BUT YOU GUYS ARE GONNA HAVE
TO WORK OFF THAT $200

19:05.278 --> 19:08.315
BY DOING EVERY FILTHY,

19:08.348 --> 19:11.484
DISGUSTING CHORE
IN THE HOUSE FOR A MONTH.

19:11.518 --> 19:12.785
NO PROBLEM.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.621
WITHOUT USING YOUR BIONICS.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.823
THAT'S A PROBLEM.

19:16.856 --> 19:19.492
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM FOR ME.
I'VE GOT TWO HELPERS.

19:19.526 --> 19:22.262
I LOVE TO CLEAN!
SCRUB, SCRUB, SCRUB, SCRUB.

19:25.565 --> 19:27.900
SERIOUSLY, MR. DAVENPORT,

19:27.934 --> 19:30.136
I WILL DONATE SOME
OF MY BRAIN CELLS

19:30.169 --> 19:34.207
JUST TO EVEN THINGS
OUT A LITTLE BIT.

19:34.241 --> 19:36.376
**

19:36.409 --> 19:38.611
WELL, IT'S 5:00.

19:38.645 --> 19:41.147
AREN'T YOU MISSING
PIG ZOMBIE SPRING BREAK:

19:41.180 --> 19:42.715
PIGS GONE WILD?

19:45.552 --> 19:49.556
YEAH, BUT, IT WON'T BE
THE SAME WITHOUT LEO.

19:49.589 --> 19:52.359
LOOK, I KNOW HE LIED,
BUT IT WAS REALLY COOL

19:52.392 --> 19:54.261
BONDING WITH HIM
OVER THOSE THINGS.

19:54.294 --> 19:55.862
THE PIG ZOMBIE MOVIES
WERE OUR THING.

19:55.895 --> 19:58.831
WE FINALLY HAD A...THING.

20:00.567 --> 20:01.734
I HAVE AN IDEA.

20:01.768 --> 20:03.803
YOU WANNA WATCH
PIG ZOMBIES WITH ME?

20:03.836 --> 20:04.904
I KNEW YOU WOULD
COME AROUND.

20:04.937 --> 20:06.506
SCORE! YES.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.908
OH, HONEY, NO.

20:08.941 --> 20:10.777
I'M A GROWN UP.

20:12.812 --> 20:15.181
( loud squealing, explosions )

20:15.214 --> 20:17.684
AAAAH!

20:17.717 --> 20:20.853
( laughter )

20:20.887 --> 20:22.955
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU CONVINCED MOM

20:22.989 --> 20:24.591
TO LET ME WATCH THIS
MARATHON WITH YOU.

20:24.624 --> 20:26.426
HA. IT WAS EASY.

20:26.459 --> 20:28.695
I JUST TOLD HER THAT INSTEAD
OF GROUNDING YOU FOR A WEEK,

20:28.728 --> 20:29.929
SHE SHOULD LET
YOU WATCH THIS.

20:29.962 --> 20:32.231
AND THEN GROUND
YOU FOR A MONTH.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.435
YOU DID LIE.

20:35.468 --> 20:38.738
OH, I WAS KINDA HOPING
YOU FORGOT ABOUT THAT.

20:38.771 --> 20:40.873
YEAH, I KINDA DIDN'T.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.809
BUT NICE TRY THOUGH.

20:42.842 --> 20:45.845
STILL, THIS IS
TOTALLY WORTH IT.

20:45.878 --> 20:47.614
I THOUGHT SO.
( laughs )

20:47.647 --> 20:51.351
TALK ABOUT A PORK CHOP.
( squeals )

20:51.384 --> 20:53.686
( both scream )

20:57.424 --> 20:58.525
ALL RIGHT,
KEEP 'EM CLOSED.

20:58.558 --> 21:00.627
KEEP 'EM CLOSED.

21:00.660 --> 21:01.961
ALL RIGHT.

21:01.994 --> 21:03.363
( thunk )
OW!

21:03.396 --> 21:04.664
WATCH WHERE
YOU'RE GOING.

21:06.499 --> 21:09.402
ALL RIGHT, SIT DOWN.
THERE YOU GO.

21:09.436 --> 21:11.438
OKAY.

21:11.471 --> 21:13.906
AND...OPEN 'EM!

21:13.940 --> 21:14.874
All:
SURPRISE!

21:14.907 --> 21:16.509
OH!

21:16.543 --> 21:19.446
YOU FIXED MY GRANDMOTHER'S
JEWELRY BOX!

21:19.479 --> 21:22.248
IT TOOK A LONG TIME,

21:22.281 --> 21:24.717
BUT LEO AND I PAINSTAKINGLY
RESTORED IT

21:24.751 --> 21:26.519
TO ITS ORIGINAL
CONDITION.

21:26.553 --> 21:29.422
EMPHASIS ON THE
PAINSTAKING PART.

21:31.057 --> 21:32.659
THAT IS SO SWEET
OF YOU GUYS.

21:32.692 --> 21:34.060
All: OH!

21:36.663 --> 21:38.665
I'LL CLEAN THAT UP.
FOR FIVE BUCKS.
