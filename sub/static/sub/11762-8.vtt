WEBVTT

00:00.531 --> 00:09.280
в™Єв™Є

00:09.280 --> 00:11.342
COULD YOU NOT PICK YOUR FEET?

00:11.342 --> 00:15.086
HONEY, THEY'RE, LIKE,
RIGHT NEXT TO MY HEAD.
WHAT? THIS IS NOT
THE GROSSEST THING

00:15.086 --> 00:17.088
THAT'S HAPPENING
AT THIS BEACH RIGHT NOW.

00:17.088 --> 00:20.121
THOSE TWO ARE
OBVIOUSLY HAVING SEX.

00:20.121 --> 00:23.424
OH!
AND THAT BOY'S PARENTS
DON'T THINK HE NEEDS TO WEAR

00:23.424 --> 00:26.727
A BATHING SUIT EVEN THOUGH
HE SEEMS TO BE ABOUT 14.
I HATE EUROPEANS.

00:26.727 --> 00:29.760
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M GONNA BE 41 ON SATURDAY.

00:29.760 --> 00:32.032
I MEAN, THAT'S IN YOUR 40s.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.335
HEY, LET'S PLAY A GAME.
I'M GONNA SAY A NUMBER,

00:34.335 --> 00:37.138
AND YOU STOP ME WHEN YOU THINK
IT'S AN AGE THAT I CAN PASS FOR.

00:37.138 --> 00:38.469
READY?
YEAH.

00:38.469 --> 00:42.543
34. 35. 36.

00:42.543 --> 00:45.316
36. 36?

00:45.316 --> 00:48.079
ALL RIGHT. STUPID GAME.
I DON'T WANT TO PLAY.

00:48.079 --> 00:50.081
CHEER UP. FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY
I'M TAKING YOU

00:50.081 --> 00:51.752
TO THAT NEW FRENCH RESTAURANT.

00:51.752 --> 00:54.085
OH, YEAH. AND THEN AFTER
YOU PUT OL' BIG HAT TO BED,

00:54.085 --> 00:56.087
YOU AND I ARE GOING
DANCING AT OASIS.

00:56.087 --> 00:58.529
HONEY,
JUST DON'T WEAR ANY RED.

00:58.529 --> 01:03.063
THEY HAVE A TINY
GANG VIOLENCE PROBLEM.
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE FORCING ME

01:03.063 --> 01:06.167
TO MAKE SEPARATE PLANS WITH
EACH OF YOU. GOING SWIMMING.

01:11.372 --> 01:14.845
FRANK, SHANNA, HI!
LONG TIME NO SEE.

01:14.845 --> 01:16.647
YEAH.

01:18.449 --> 01:20.451
SUCH A LONG TIME.

01:20.451 --> 01:22.653
ANYWAY, SEE YOU AROUND.

01:26.757 --> 01:29.260
WHEN BOBBY AND I
WERE MARRIED,

01:29.260 --> 01:31.262
WE WERE KIND OF FRIENDS
WITH THE MILLERS.

01:31.262 --> 01:34.825
THEY WERE SO WEIRD. DO YOU THINK
IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE DIVORCE?

01:34.825 --> 01:37.828
IT COULD BE. OR IT COULD BE
THAT WHEN YOUR SWIMSUIT IS WET,

01:37.828 --> 01:40.631
IT'S SO SEE-THROUGH, I CAN COUNT
THE INDIVIDUAL GOOSE BUMPS

01:40.631 --> 01:42.233
ON YOUR NERPS.
(gasps)

01:42.233 --> 01:44.575
WHY DO THEY EVEN SELL
WHITE BATHING SUITS?

01:44.575 --> 01:47.138
ARE YOU SURE THEY NOTICED?

01:47.138 --> 01:49.710
(both speaking indistinctly)

01:49.710 --> 01:52.743
PRETTY SURE.

01:56.617 --> 01:59.119
I WOULDN'T WAIT FOR
HER TEST RESULTS TO COME IN.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.592
MNH-MNH.
I'D GET ON ANTIBIOTICS NOW.

02:01.592 --> 02:03.824
I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW
THAT SUMMER IS A STUDENT.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.856
TODAY IS HER THIRD DAY
OF MASSAGE SCHOOL.

02:05.856 --> 02:08.859
(chuckles)
WISH I COULD TAKE THAT BACK.

02:08.859 --> 02:10.401
BUT YOU CAN'T.

02:10.401 --> 02:13.404
MOMMY, IF THAT LADY SLEPT
OVER AT MR. ELLIS' HOUSE,

02:13.404 --> 02:15.866
DOES THAT MEAN
THEY'RE IN LOVE?

02:15.866 --> 02:19.770
OH, WELL, HE LOVES
PARTS OF HER, SWEETIE.
HA HA.

02:21.212 --> 02:24.275
(indistinct conversations)

02:24.275 --> 02:26.717
OH, GOOD. SHANNA, HI.

02:26.717 --> 02:29.220
I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT YESTERDAY.

02:29.220 --> 02:31.652
I HAD A LITTLE
HEADLIGHT INCIDENT.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.854
THEY KNOW.

02:33.854 --> 02:36.687
WHAT DID YOU THINK WOULD HAPPEN
WITH A WHITE SWIMSUIT?

02:36.687 --> 02:39.760
IN THE CATALOG, THE MODEL
WAS COMING OUT OF THE WATER,

02:39.760 --> 02:42.433
AND IT LOOKED FINE, BUT SHE
WAS ALSO WEARING HIGH HEELS

02:42.433 --> 02:45.896
AND WAS ON A MOTORCYCLE, SO...
IT'S OKAY, JULES.

02:45.896 --> 02:47.798
BESIDES, IT'S TYPICAL.
TYPICAL?

02:47.798 --> 02:51.542
EVER SINCE YOU GOT DIVORCED,
WE'VE NOTICED THE SHORT SKIRTS,

02:51.542 --> 02:55.376
THE 28-YEAR-OLD BOYFRIEND.
28 1/2, AND WE BROKE UP.

02:55.376 --> 02:58.309
HIS MOM TOLD ME.
SHE'S IN MY CHURCH GROUP.

02:58.309 --> 02:59.850
LET'S GO, GIRLS.

02:59.850 --> 03:03.414
"LET'S GO, GIRLS"? WHAT IS THIS,
SOME WEIRD MOM GANG?

03:05.916 --> 03:08.959
WHEN DID SHANNA
GET TO BE SO MEAN?

03:08.959 --> 03:10.961
THAT CATTY BITCH
IS JUST JEALOUS

03:10.961 --> 03:13.824
'CAUSE YOU'RE A 41-YEAR-OLD
HOTTIE WHO CAN PASS FOR 38.

03:13.824 --> 03:16.867
I BELIEVE WE AGREED ON 36.
OH.

03:16.867 --> 03:19.830
I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE IN THIS
STUPID TOWN FOR MY BIRTHDAY.

03:19.830 --> 03:22.202
EVERYBODY TALKS
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.675
I JUST WANT TO GO SOMEWHERE
WHERE NO ONE KNOWS WHO I AM

03:24.675 --> 03:26.907
AND I COULD JUST LET LOOSE
AND NOT BE JUDGED.

03:26.907 --> 03:29.640
HOW ABOUT THAT NEW BEACH RESORT
ON SIESTA KEY?

03:29.640 --> 03:31.912
YES!
NO.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.914
COME ON!
WE CAN ALL SHARE A SUITE,

03:33.914 --> 03:36.547
AND THEN WE CAN MAKE PLANS
TO RENT BIKES AND--AND KAYAKS

03:36.547 --> 03:38.489
AND PADDLEBOARDS
AND THEN NEVER DO ANY OF IT.

03:38.489 --> 03:40.951
I WOULDN'T SHARE A SUITE
WITH TRAMPOLINA HERE

03:40.951 --> 03:43.794
IF THEY GAVE AWAY FREE LIPO
WITH A CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST.

03:43.794 --> 03:46.597
DITTO. I'D RATHER GO BALD.

03:46.597 --> 03:48.429
IT'S MY BIRTHDAY,
SO SUCK IT UP.

03:48.429 --> 03:51.302
COME ON.
HOW FUN WOULD A ROAD TRIP BE?

03:51.302 --> 03:52.933
FUN.
SO MUCH FUN.

03:52.933 --> 03:54.705
OH, PLEASE TRY HARDER.

03:54.705 --> 03:56.837
FUN!
SO MUCH FUN!

03:56.837 --> 03:58.569
THANK YOU.

03:58.569 --> 04:00.641
OKAY, YOUR DAD
CONVINCED SOME TOURIST

04:00.641 --> 04:03.013
THAT HE'S A HUNTING GUIDE.

04:03.013 --> 04:05.346
SO NOT ONLY CAN HE NOT
WATCH YOU THIS WEEKEND,

04:05.346 --> 04:07.818
BUT THERE'S
A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE

04:07.818 --> 04:10.751
HE'S GONNA END UP DEAD
IN THE WOODS.
WELL, I AM 18.
DON'T NEED A BABYSITTER.

04:10.751 --> 04:13.253
LOOK, I WAS YOUR AGE.

04:13.253 --> 04:16.026
I KNOW THE KIND OF STUFF I DID
WHEN MY PARENTS WENT AWAY.
YEAH, I KNOW WHERE
THIS IS GOING, OKAY?

04:16.026 --> 04:20.731
YOUR CAUTIONARY TALES ALWAYS END
UP WITH YOU GIVING BIRTH TO ME.
IT WAS THE HAPPIEST DAY
OF MY LIFE.

04:20.731 --> 04:23.634
DAMN STRAIGHT.

04:23.634 --> 04:26.667
I CAN CHECK IN ON THE KID IF
YOU PROMISE TO STOP HASSLING ME

04:26.667 --> 04:29.700
ABOUT THE GIRLS I BRING HOME.
YEAH, I CAN'T DO IT.

04:29.700 --> 04:32.503
MM.
WELL, I GUESS I COULD PROBABLY
STOP FOR, LIKE, THREE DAYS.

04:32.503 --> 04:36.547
DEAL. I WONDER HOW MANY
I CAN CYCLE THROUGH THE ABODE

04:36.547 --> 04:39.810
IN THREE DAYS.
I'M GUESSING, LIKE, SEVEN.

04:39.810 --> 04:43.454
LUCKY, LUCKY GIRLS.

04:43.454 --> 04:44.785
PSST.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.057
OKAY, SO HERE'S THE PLAN.

04:47.057 --> 04:49.460
DO NOT COME OVER
TO MY HOUSE.

04:49.460 --> 04:51.722
IF THE HOUSE IS ON FIRE,
YOU MAY KNOCK ONCE.

04:51.722 --> 04:53.864
IF I DON'T ANSWER,
ASSUME I SET THE FIRE,

04:53.864 --> 04:56.867
AND I WANT TO BURN TO DEATH.
YOU'RE A NEAT KID.

04:56.867 --> 04:59.870
(door closes)
OH, WHEN BOBBY AND I
WENT CAMPING FOR ONE WEEK,

04:59.870 --> 05:02.873
ALL WE BROUGHT WAS BIG SPRAY,
MATCHES AND A COFFEE CAKE.

05:02.873 --> 05:05.436
YOU GUYS ARE GOING AWAY
FOR ONE NIGHT, RIGHT?

05:05.436 --> 05:08.038
WHAT'S YOUR POINT,
V-NECK?

05:08.038 --> 05:11.011
I TOOK ALL OUR PILLOWS.
GREAT.

05:11.011 --> 05:13.644
ALL RIGHT, READY, LADIES?
YEP.

05:13.644 --> 05:16.347
ROAD TRIP.
WHOO!

05:22.523 --> 05:24.495
ENJOY YOUR STAY
AT PLAYA DEL ROCA.

05:24.495 --> 05:26.857
THANK YOU,
TRENT FROM TALLAHASSEE.

05:26.857 --> 05:29.830
YOU KNOW, WE'RE HERE
CELEBRATING MY 34th BIRTHDAY.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.863
DO YOU FIND THAT TO BE
A BELIEVABLE STATEMENT?

05:32.863 --> 05:35.536
COULD HAVE BEEN A $20,
TRENT.

05:35.536 --> 05:37.908
SOMEONE'S GOING TO BELIEVE
I'M 34 IF IT KILLS ME.

05:37.908 --> 05:41.772
I THOUGHT WE AGREED ON 36.
MM. AT HOME I'D BE HAPPY
WITH A 36,

05:41.772 --> 05:43.974
MAYBE EVEN A SOLID 38.

05:43.974 --> 05:45.776
BUT THAT'S REGULAR JULES.

05:45.776 --> 05:48.348
HERE, I'M RESORT JULES.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.681
AND RESORT JULES IS FUN,
AND SHE'S CRAZY,

05:50.681 --> 05:52.683
AND SHE REFERS TO HERSELF
IN THE THIRD PERSON

05:52.683 --> 05:55.826
LIKE A PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE.
RESORT JULES IS HUNGRY.

05:55.826 --> 05:59.860
YEAH.
OOH! I CALL THE BED
BY THE WINDOW!

05:59.860 --> 06:01.962
HOW ARE YOU ALREADY NAKED?

06:01.962 --> 06:04.665
WHAT? I WAS CHANGING, AND I GOT
SIDETRACKED BY BED CHOICE.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.667
WELL, OF COURSE IT'S YOUR BED

06:06.667 --> 06:08.799
NOW THAT YOU HAVE
YOUR TRAMP STINK ALL OVER IT.

06:08.799 --> 06:11.472
JULES, DID YOU HEAR HER?
BITCH, I AM A LADY.

06:11.472 --> 06:13.644
YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT
FOR MY BIRTHDAY?

06:13.644 --> 06:15.646
FOR US ALL TO GET ALONG.

06:15.646 --> 06:18.108
THIS WEEKEND WE'RE GONNA BE LIKE
THELMA AND LOUISE AND LOUISE.

06:18.108 --> 06:23.584
YOU KNOW, THEY DIE
AT THE END OF THAT MOVIE.
YOU WATCH. YOU'RE GONNA
END UP BEING FRIENDS.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.756
PLAYA DEL ROCA
IS A MAGICAL PLACE.

06:25.756 --> 06:28.859
EW! THERE'S A DEAD LIZARD
IN THE TOILET!
(flushes)

06:28.859 --> 06:30.861
(singsong voice) BYE, ELLIE!

06:30.861 --> 06:33.393
(normal voice) I NAMED HIM.

06:33.393 --> 06:36.396
I HATE HER.

06:38.469 --> 06:41.572
OH, MAN, ISN'T THIS FUN?

06:41.572 --> 06:43.574
I'M EATING BACON
IN A BIKINI.

06:43.574 --> 06:46.637
HEY, TAKE A PICTURE OF ME
EATING BACON IN A BIKINI.

06:46.637 --> 06:50.581
ARCH YOUR BACK
AND STICK OUT YOUR CHEST.
AND SAY...
(singsong voice) "CLASSY!"

06:50.581 --> 06:53.043
REGULAR JULES WOULD NEVER
DO THIS, BUT RESORT JULES SAYS

06:53.043 --> 06:56.186
SAY HELLO TO TANYA AND HER
SLIGHTLY SMALLER TWIN TINA.

06:56.186 --> 06:57.888
(chuckles)
(camera shutter clicks)

07:04.995 --> 07:07.758
(door closes)
DID YOU JUST GIVE HIM
THE "HIT THAT" NOD?

07:07.758 --> 07:10.731
I DID.
JULES SAID NO GIRLS
IN THE HOUSE.

07:10.731 --> 07:13.163
SHE WON'T FIND OUT.
JULES ALWAYS FINDS OUT.

07:13.163 --> 07:16.436
YOU KNOW, I BABYSAT TRAVIS
ONCE WHEN HE WAS 12,

07:16.436 --> 07:20.070
AND I MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE
LET HIM WATCH "9 1/2 WEEKS."

07:20.070 --> 07:22.643
SOMEHOW JULES FOUND OUT.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.575
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,

07:24.575 --> 07:26.647
HER BROWNIES STARTED
HAVING PECANS IN THEM,

07:26.647 --> 07:29.550
WHICH IS KIND OF WEIRD
'CAUSE I'M ALLERGIC TO PECANS,

07:29.550 --> 07:30.921
AND JULES KNOWS THAT.

07:30.921 --> 07:33.824
IT WAS LIKE, I DON'T KNOW,
SHE WAS TRYING TO KILL ME.

07:33.824 --> 07:35.826
BUT THAT'S JUST SILLY,
RIGHT?

07:35.826 --> 07:37.828
I'M--I'M PARANOID.
WHOO! WEIRDO, RIGHT?

07:37.828 --> 07:39.760
THAT'S JUST SILLY.
(chuckles)

07:39.760 --> 07:42.533
THIS IS WHY
WE DON'T HANG OUT MORE.

07:42.533 --> 07:44.965
OKAY, TOUGH GUY.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.797
MAGAZINE SEX QUIZ.

07:46.797 --> 07:50.941
"IS IT OKAY TO HAVE SEX
IN A LIMO BEFORE YOUR PROM?"

07:50.941 --> 07:54.174
OH, THAT'S A BIG NO.
I GET NAUSEOUS RIDING SIDEWAYS.

07:54.174 --> 07:57.978
OOH! (singsong voice) YOU GUYS,
CHECK OUT THE HOTTIES.
(speaking indistinctly)

07:57.978 --> 08:01.812
(normal voice)
SHOULD WE INVITE 'EM OVER?
NO! THAT'S THE REASON
I GOT A CABANA--

08:01.812 --> 08:04.785
TO AVOID MEN
WITH BARBED WIRE TATTOOS.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.717
THOSE ARE MY PEOPLE.

08:06.717 --> 08:08.759
OF COURSE THEY ARE.

08:08.759 --> 08:11.862
SHE DOESN'T REALIZE
THIS IS THE REAL FUN--

08:11.862 --> 08:15.165
YOU KNOW, SITTIN' HERE
ALL BY OURSELVES

08:15.165 --> 08:17.167
DOIN' NOTHING.

08:17.167 --> 08:19.670
YOU WANT TO INVITE THEM OVER,
DON'T YOU?

08:19.670 --> 08:21.672
NO.

08:21.672 --> 08:23.734
BUT RESORT JULES DOES.

08:23.734 --> 08:26.807
(lowers voice)
SHE HAS BAD JUDGMENT.
FINE.

08:26.807 --> 08:29.009
(laughter)

08:29.009 --> 08:31.141
ISN'T THIS FUN?

08:36.216 --> 08:38.549
NO FIRE HERE. SEE YA.

08:38.549 --> 08:40.851
YOUR MOM SAID NO GIRLS.

08:40.851 --> 08:42.693
I'M SORRY, YOUNG LADY,
YOU'VE GOTTA GO.

08:42.693 --> 08:45.856
IT--IT'S OKAY.
I'LL JUST GET MY STUFF.

08:45.856 --> 08:48.829
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
HER STUFF IS?

08:48.829 --> 08:50.931
IT'S FLAVORED LIP GLOSS
AND AN OVERSIZED T-SHIRT

08:50.931 --> 08:54.064
FOR WHEN SHE GETS, AND I QUOTE,
"TIRED AND SNUGGLY."

08:54.064 --> 08:58.008
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME,
DUDE?

08:58.008 --> 09:00.070
RESORT JULES
BROUGHT ALL THE THINGS

09:00.070 --> 09:01.872
THAT SHE'S AFRAID
TO WEAR AT HOME.

09:01.872 --> 09:03.874
SO... FARMER'S DAUGHTER
OR... WHERE IS IT?

09:03.874 --> 09:06.777
AH. WHITESNAKE VIDEO?

09:06.777 --> 09:08.819
(laughs) WELL, I GET
TO PICK WHAT WE DO NEXT,

09:08.819 --> 09:11.722
AND TRUST ME, IT'S NOT
GONNA MATTER WHAT YOU WEAR.
WHY?

09:11.722 --> 09:13.624
OH, NO.

09:13.624 --> 09:15.856
MMM!

09:15.856 --> 09:17.828
THERE IS NOTHING BETTER
THAN DRINKING CHAMPAGNE

09:17.828 --> 09:21.091
TOPLESS IN A HOT TUB.
AM I RIGHT?

09:21.091 --> 09:24.865
TOO SOON TO TELL.
COME ON, JULES. HAVE A DRINK.
YOU'LL LOOSEN UP.

09:24.865 --> 09:27.768
ELLIE, POUR SOME CHAMPAGNE
INTO MY MOUTH.

09:27.768 --> 09:29.770
THERE YOU GO, SWEETIE.
MMM. MMM.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.802
COME ON, GRANDMA,
LOSE THE TOP.

09:31.802 --> 09:34.775
YOU'RE MAKING JULES
SELF-CONSCIOUS.
YEAH, LOSE THE TOP.

09:34.775 --> 09:36.246
PIPE DOWN, MAN BOOBS.

09:36.246 --> 09:38.609
LAURIE, HONEY,
IT'S NOT ELLIE

09:38.609 --> 09:40.580
THAT'S MAKING ME
FEEL SELF-CONSCIOUS.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.714
YOU SEE THE NICE GENTLEMAN
OVER HERE?
JIM.

09:43.714 --> 09:46.717
WELL, JIM HASN'T HAD HIS HANDS
ABOVE THE WATER SINCE HE GOT IN,

09:46.717 --> 09:49.589
AND NOW SOMEONE'S TOES ARE
INTERLOCKING WITH MY TOES.

09:49.589 --> 09:50.921
(chuckles)

09:50.921 --> 09:53.263
I THINK I'M GONNA
HEAD BACK TO MY ROOM.

09:54.925 --> 09:58.368
WHOOPTY-WHOO,
YOUR BOOBS ARE OUT. BIG DEAL.

09:58.368 --> 10:00.370
WHY DO YOU HAVE
TO RUIN EVERYTHING?

10:00.370 --> 10:03.804
IF YOU'D JUST GONE ALONG
WITH IT, IT COULD HAVE BEEN FUN.

10:03.804 --> 10:06.837
YOU KNOW THAT.
NOT ALL FUN THINGS REVOLVE
AROUND BEING TOPLESS.

10:06.837 --> 10:08.679
(scoffs)
AND IF WE'RE KEEPING SCORE,

10:08.679 --> 10:10.210
YOU RUINED THE CABANA

10:10.210 --> 10:12.813
BY FILLING IT
WITH PHI BETA HERPES.

10:12.813 --> 10:16.386
RIGHT, MOOBS?
I HATE BEING AROUND YOU.

10:16.386 --> 10:20.791
(gasps)
HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT? GOOD.
SNOB.

10:20.791 --> 10:22.392
SKANK.
BITCH.

10:22.392 --> 10:25.756
WHORE.
KISS!

10:25.756 --> 10:27.758
BYE, TRAVIS.

10:27.758 --> 10:30.761
BYE, KYLIE.

10:30.761 --> 10:33.303
TONIGHT WAS GOING
TO BE THE NIGHT.
(door opens and closes)

10:33.303 --> 10:36.006
LOOK, SEX IS SUPPOSED TO BE
AN EMOTIONAL CONNECTION

10:36.006 --> 10:38.268
BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE--
ARE YOU REALLY GIVING ME

10:38.268 --> 10:41.211
THE "SEX SHOULD BE SPECIAL"
SPEECH?

10:41.211 --> 10:43.213
TELL ME, HOW WAS IT SPECIAL

10:43.213 --> 10:45.415
WITH THE GIRL
WHO PUKED IN YOUR MAILBOX

10:45.415 --> 10:47.818
OR THE GIRL WHO SAYS
SHE DOESN'T WEAR SHOES

10:47.818 --> 10:50.751
BECAUSE THEY FEEL TOO SHOES-Y?
"SHOES-Y" IS A WORD.

10:50.751 --> 10:53.684
LOOK, I-I'M SORRY
TO D-BLOCK YOU, MAN,

10:53.684 --> 10:56.757
BUT WHAT'S DONE
IS--IS--IS DONE.

10:56.757 --> 10:59.760
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

10:59.760 --> 11:02.432
I WASN'T GONNA GET ANYWHERE
WITH KYLIE ANYWAY.

11:02.432 --> 11:06.697
SURE YOU WERE, MAN. SHE, UH,
SHE SEEMED PRETTY INTO YOU.

11:06.697 --> 11:09.069
YEAH, IT'S NOT THAT.
IT'S JUST THAT...

11:11.702 --> 11:14.274
I DON'T THINK
I LIKE GIRLS.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.076
OH, Y--

11:16.076 --> 11:17.778
ALL GIRLS?

11:19.750 --> 11:20.981
(cell phone rings)
ANDY?

11:20.981 --> 11:23.714
HEY, JULES, HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
THANKS.

11:23.714 --> 11:26.056
JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW
THAT TRAVIS IS PRETENDING

11:26.056 --> 11:28.959
TO COME OUT TO GRAYSON
TO MESS WITH HIS HEAD.

11:28.959 --> 11:30.961
I REMEMBER HALLOWEEN
WHEN I WAS 11.

11:30.961 --> 11:33.323
MY FRIEND ERIC WORE
THIS SUPERMAN COSTUME,

11:33.323 --> 11:37.127
AND WHEN I SAW THOSE RED TIGHTS,
I WAS... I FELT THIS FEELING

11:37.127 --> 11:39.469
LIKE... LIKE BUTTERFLIES,

11:39.469 --> 11:42.002
BUT HOT BUTTERFLIES, YOU KNOW?

11:45.075 --> 11:48.078
(laughs) I LOVE
WHEN TRAVIS DOES THAT.

11:48.078 --> 11:50.811
OH, MY GOD!
I GOTTA CALL YOU BACK.
(cell phone shuts, beep)

11:50.811 --> 11:53.814
WHERE IS THAT MOUTHY WAITRESS
WITH OUR CHANGE?

11:53.814 --> 11:55.415
(scoffs)

11:55.415 --> 11:58.418
WELL, SHE PROBABLY THOUGHT
THAT EXTRA 40 CENTS WAS A TIP.

11:58.418 --> 12:00.751
(lowered voice) FRANK!

12:00.751 --> 12:02.923
(lowered voice)
JULES. WHY ARE YOU HERE?

12:02.923 --> 12:06.196
ARE YOU TRYING
TO RUIN MY MARRIAGE?
IT IS MY BIRTHDAY.

12:06.196 --> 12:09.830
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
WELL, I HAD TO TAKE SHANNA
SOMEPLACE NICE

12:09.830 --> 12:11.832
BECAUSE OF YESTERDAY.

12:11.832 --> 12:15.305
(whispers)
YOU ARE A TOUCHY SUBJECT!

12:15.305 --> 12:17.207
(lowered voice) OKAY, LOOK,
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO--

12:17.207 --> 12:19.739
IT WAS WEIRD.
SHANNA GOT ALL SWEET, OKAY?

12:19.739 --> 12:22.442
SHE GETS SWEET, AND THEN
SHE SAYS TO ME, "FRANK,

12:22.442 --> 12:25.515
"IF I WAS TO DIE, WHICH ONE
OF MY FRIENDS WOULD YOU,

12:25.515 --> 12:28.518
"YOU KNOW?" YOU KNOW.

12:28.518 --> 12:31.481
AND YOU PICKED ME?
(whispers) YES.

12:31.481 --> 12:34.384
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?
(normal voice)
THAT'S MY MOJITO.

12:34.384 --> 12:36.526
(slurps)
NOW EVERY TIME YOU HAVE SEX,

12:36.526 --> 12:39.389
SHANNA THINKS
YOU'RE SEEING MY FACE.

12:39.389 --> 12:41.391
NO. I ALWAYS SEE HER FACE.

12:41.391 --> 12:43.794
(whispers)
I SOMETIMES SEE YOUR LEGS.

12:43.794 --> 12:47.467
WELL, YOU DIDN'T
TELL HER THAT, DID YOU?

12:47.467 --> 12:50.540
OH, FRANK,
YOU'RE KILLIN' ME!

12:50.540 --> 12:53.473
SHANNA'S HERE.

12:53.473 --> 12:55.345
(gasps)
WHAT?! NO WAY!

12:55.345 --> 12:59.549
YES WAY. IT IS LIKE I AM
SOME SORT OF BITCH MAGNET.

12:59.549 --> 13:01.351
NO OFFENSE.
NONE TAKEN. YOU OKAY?

13:01.351 --> 13:03.353
WELL,
I STARTED TO FALL APART,

13:03.353 --> 13:05.886
BUT THEN RESORT JULES
BORROWED A STRANGER'S INHALER

13:05.886 --> 13:08.288
AND PICKED HERSELF BACK UP.
AND I STILL GET TO HAVE

13:08.288 --> 13:10.060
A KICK-ASS BIRTHDAY

13:10.060 --> 13:11.922
BECAUSE FRANK AND SHANNA
AREN'T GONNA BE AROUND.

13:11.922 --> 13:14.264
FRANK'S' GONNA TAKE HER
INTO TOWN FOR SOME DINNER,

13:14.264 --> 13:17.567
AND THEY'RE GONNA GO BACK
TO THEIR ROOM AND WATCH A PORNO.
(both) UGH!

13:17.567 --> 13:20.100
I KNOW. WELL, IF I HAD
TO HEAR IT, SO DO YOU.

13:20.100 --> 13:23.233
OKAY, SO WHO'S IN? DINNER
AND DANCING--LET'S HIT IT.
ACTUALLY, YOU'RE JUST
HAVING DINNER WITH ME.

13:23.233 --> 13:25.575
YEAH, AND THEN AFTER YOU
PUT QUEEN BUZZKILL TO BED,

13:25.575 --> 13:29.139
YOU AND I ARE GOING OUT
FOR SOME REAL FUN.
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

13:29.139 --> 13:32.082
YOU KNOW WHAT?
SCREW YOU BOTH.

13:32.082 --> 13:34.044
JULES, WE WERE JUST THINKING--
JULES, WE JUST THOUGHT
THAT MAYBE--

13:34.044 --> 13:37.017
NO. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.
I'M GONNA GO OUT ON MY OWN.

13:37.017 --> 13:39.019
I'M GONNA HAVE A GREAT TIME.

13:41.521 --> 13:44.524
YOU KNOW, IT'S MY BIRTHDAY.
I'M 34.

13:44.524 --> 13:46.556
REALLY?

13:46.556 --> 13:48.128
I'M 34.

13:48.128 --> 13:50.430
GREAT.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.002
(under breath) BITCH.

13:58.308 --> 14:01.541
(indistinct conversations,
laughter)

14:01.541 --> 14:04.975
HEY, EVERYONE,
IT'S MY BIRTHDAY!

14:04.975 --> 14:07.847
AND EVEN THOUGH
MY FRIENDS ARE JERKS,

14:07.847 --> 14:10.951
THE NEXT ROUND'S ON ME.
I'LL TAKE SOME POTATO SKINS.

14:10.951 --> 14:13.253
THERE'S NO POTATO SKINS.

14:13.253 --> 14:15.155
YOU CAN BUY ME A DRINK.

14:15.155 --> 14:18.959
OH! TRENT FROM TALLAHASSEE.

14:18.959 --> 14:21.631
WOW, YOU'RE EVEN CUTER
OUT OF YOUR UNIFORM.

14:21.631 --> 14:25.135
I'M GAY.
JUST GO WITH IT, TRENT.

14:25.135 --> 14:27.898
COME ON. I'M TRYING TO SCRAPE
TOGETHER A FANTASY HERE.

14:27.898 --> 14:31.471
IF CAN BE RESORT JULES,
THEN YOU CAN BE STRAIGHT TRENT.

14:31.471 --> 14:33.373
I WAS STRAIGHT TRENT
FOR 16 YEARS.

14:33.373 --> 14:36.206
MM. GREAT.
WHAT'S ANOTHER HOUR, HMM?

14:37.547 --> 14:41.912
OH, MY GOSH.
I RUINED JULES' BIRTHDAY.

14:41.912 --> 14:44.884
NO, I DID.
YEAH, YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.117
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHY SHE LIKES ME.

14:47.117 --> 14:49.119
COME ON. YOU'RE HER
BIGGEST CHEERLEADER.

14:49.119 --> 14:51.291
YOU'RE ALWAYS PUSHING HER
TO DO NEW STUFF.

14:51.291 --> 14:54.464
I JUST HOLD HER BACK.
PLEASE! YOU TWO HAVE
ALL THIS SHARED HISTORY.

14:54.464 --> 14:57.127
I MEAN, YOU GAINED
AND LOST 10 POUNDS WITH HER

14:57.127 --> 14:59.129
DURING HER DIVORCE.
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

14:59.129 --> 15:01.301
I GET STRETCH MARKS
FROM SNORING TOO HARD.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.533
YOU MAKE IT TOO EASY
TO JUDGE YOU.

15:03.533 --> 15:05.405
I'M SORRY.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.337
IT'S OKAY.

15:07.337 --> 15:10.040
HEY, WHILE WE WAIT
FOR JULES TO COME BACK,

15:10.040 --> 15:14.014
DO YOU THINK IT'D BE OKAY
IF WE DRANK SOME CHAMPAGNE?
JULES WOULD WANT THAT.

15:14.014 --> 15:16.386
DO YOU THINK
SHE'S HAVING ANY FUN?

15:16.386 --> 15:19.089
(Leona Naess) в™Є WHO KNOWS
WHAT I REALLY WILL HEAR в™Є

15:19.089 --> 15:22.192
в™Є WHAT I REALLY WILL SAY,
WHAT I REALLY WILL FEEL? в™Є

15:22.192 --> 15:24.354
YOU LOOK FAB, BY THE WAY.

15:24.354 --> 15:27.027
(chuckles) STRAIGHT GUYS
DON'T SAY "FAB," TRENT.

15:27.027 --> 15:29.459
GET IT TOGETHER, DUDE.

15:29.459 --> 15:32.262
YOU KNOW, I FEEL WEIRD THAT
WE'RE THE ONLY ONES DANCING...

15:32.262 --> 15:34.364
(sniffs) AND THAT WE'RE
WEARING THE SAME PERFUME.

15:34.364 --> 15:36.366
THINK I'M GONNA
CALL IT A NIGHT.

15:36.366 --> 15:38.338
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.
JUST HOLD ON.

15:38.338 --> 15:41.311
в™Є THE NIGHT IS THE BRIGHTEST в™Є

15:41.311 --> 15:44.314
в™Є WHO KNOWS
WHAT I REALLY WILL HEAR в™Є

15:44.314 --> 15:47.347
в™Є WHAT I REALLY WILL SAY,
WHAT I REALLY WILL FEEL? в™Є

15:47.347 --> 15:50.380
в™Є WHO KNOWS WHAT YOU
REALLY WILL HEAR в™Є

15:50.380 --> 15:54.224
в™Є WHAT YOU REALLY WILL SAY,
WHAT YOU REALLY WILL FEEL? в™Є

15:54.224 --> 15:56.056
WOW.

15:56.056 --> 15:59.359
I KNOW YOU'RE JUST PRETENDING,
BUT MAYBE LATER WE COULD--
STILL GAY.

15:59.359 --> 16:01.431
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

16:01.431 --> 16:03.163
YOU'RE CUTE, THOUGH.

16:03.163 --> 16:04.264
OKAY.

16:04.264 --> 16:06.496
в™Є THE NIGHT IS в™Є

16:06.496 --> 16:09.269
в™Є THE BRIGHTEST в™Є

16:09.269 --> 16:12.402
(sighs) I'M SORRY TO THROW
ALL THIS ON YOU.

16:12.402 --> 16:14.044
NO, IT'S OKAY.

16:14.044 --> 16:16.506
I'M--I'M GLAD YOU CHOSE ME
TO COME OUT TO,

16:16.506 --> 16:19.309
EVEN THOUGH WE BARELY
KNOW EACH OTHER.

16:19.309 --> 16:21.311
I MEAN, IT'S JUST SO SCARY.

16:21.311 --> 16:23.313
NEIL PATRICK HARRIS
HAS PAVED SOME NEW GROUND,

16:23.313 --> 16:25.385
BUT... (sighs)
I DON'T KNOW.

16:25.385 --> 16:28.258
TRAVIS,
IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

16:28.258 --> 16:31.361
HAS ANYBODY EVER TOLD YOU
HOW SOOTHING YOUR VOICE IS?

16:31.361 --> 16:34.124
NOT TODAY, NO.

16:36.366 --> 16:40.270
AHH.

16:40.270 --> 16:42.372
FRANK!
JULES.

16:42.372 --> 16:44.674
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
IN YOUR ROOM WATCHING PORN.

16:44.674 --> 16:46.476
WE ALREADY DID.

16:46.476 --> 16:50.310
OH. THAT MAKES THIS
EVEN MORE GROSS.
ARE YOU NAKED?

16:50.310 --> 16:51.311
A LITTLE.

16:51.311 --> 16:53.783
SHANNA!

16:53.783 --> 16:56.146
THIS IS THE CRAZIEST STORY.

16:56.146 --> 16:58.318
(laughs) I BET.

16:58.318 --> 17:00.620
I BET. DO YOU HAVE
ANY SELF-RESPECT?

17:00.620 --> 17:03.193
ARE YOU TALKING TO HIM
OR ME?

17:03.193 --> 17:04.654
I'M GONNA GO.

17:04.654 --> 17:07.157
GOOD NIGHT, FRANK.

17:07.157 --> 17:09.659
DON'T TALK TO HIM.
YOU'RE PATHETIC.

17:09.659 --> 17:12.332
WOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
GETTING SO ANGRY ABOUT, SHANNA.

17:12.332 --> 17:15.505
MAYBE YOU'RE FEELING A LITTLE
TRAPPED IN YOUR OWN LIFE.

17:15.505 --> 17:18.268
MAYBE IT'S FRANK'S WEIRD
NEW MUSTACHE. I DON'T KNOW.

17:18.268 --> 17:20.410
BUT YOU GOTTA STOP
PICKING ON ME, OKAY?

17:20.410 --> 17:22.572
YOU'RE BEING TOO MEAN.

17:22.572 --> 17:25.345
SO YOU DON'T THINK
YOU'VE DONE ANYTHING WRONG?

17:25.345 --> 17:27.147
NOPE.

17:27.147 --> 17:29.679
I WONDER IF EVERYONE
BACK HOME WILL AGREE.

17:29.679 --> 17:32.422
NOBODY LIKES GOSSIP,
SHANNA.

17:32.422 --> 17:34.154
YEAH, THEY DO.

17:34.154 --> 17:36.786
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THEY REALLY DO.

17:36.786 --> 17:40.390
I HAVE TO PEE.
HOLD IT.

17:43.293 --> 17:45.595
(door closes)
THERE'S OUR BIRTHDAY GIRL!

17:45.595 --> 17:48.298
YOU'RE WET.
SIT ON HER BED!

17:48.298 --> 17:49.739
(sighs)

17:49.739 --> 17:50.800
WHAT'S WRONG NOW?

17:50.800 --> 17:54.374
SHANNA WAS SO MEAN TO ME.

17:54.374 --> 17:56.546
MEAN?
TO YOU?

17:56.546 --> 17:59.609
SHAH-NA?

17:59.609 --> 18:01.311
IT'S SHANNA.

18:01.311 --> 18:03.353
NOBODY CARES.

18:03.353 --> 18:05.355
YOU'RE MESSING
WITH OUR FRIEND,

18:05.355 --> 18:07.257
AND WE FEEL LIKE
WE NEED TO RESPOND.

18:07.257 --> 18:10.590
HERE'S THE DEAL. IF YOU EVER
SAY ANYTHING ABOUT JULES

18:10.590 --> 18:12.592
TO ANYONE EVER AGAIN,

18:12.592 --> 18:15.465
MONGO HERE IS GONNA
BEAT THE LIVING CRAP OUTTA YA.

18:15.465 --> 18:18.128
SERIOUSLY,
I FIGHT ALL THE TIME.

18:18.128 --> 18:20.530
SHE WILL HOLD YOUR ARMS,
AND I WILL BEAT YOU

18:20.530 --> 18:22.532
UNTIL YOUR SPANX
ARE THE ONLY THING

18:22.532 --> 18:24.374
HOLDING YOUR TORSO TOGETHER.

18:24.374 --> 18:26.536
HAVE THE BEST EVENING.
REALLY ENJOY IT.

18:26.536 --> 18:30.340
GOOD TIMES WITH YOU,
SHAH-NA.

18:30.340 --> 18:32.342
(sighs deeply)

18:32.342 --> 18:33.743
WHAT?

18:33.743 --> 18:36.586
YOUR MUSTACHE IS STUPID.

18:36.586 --> 18:38.518
I WANT A DIVORCE.
NO.

18:38.518 --> 18:39.819
в™Єв™Є

18:39.819 --> 18:41.821
I MEAN, THE THING IS,

18:41.821 --> 18:44.354
SOMETIMES WHEN KYLIE WEARS
HER JAZZ DANCE OUTFIT,

18:44.354 --> 18:47.357
SHE LOOKS REALLY PRETTY TO ME,
BUT THEN IT'S... OH, GOD.

18:47.357 --> 18:50.360
I DON'T KNOW. WHAT THE HELL?
AM I SOME KIND OF FREAK?

18:50.360 --> 18:53.833
NO, YOU'RE NOT A FREAK, OKAY?
SEXUALITY IS CONFUSING.
(sighs)

18:53.833 --> 18:56.766
IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER,

18:56.766 --> 18:59.909
ONE TIME AT
MY COUSIN BEN'S LAKE HOUSE,

18:59.909 --> 19:02.141
WE WERE TALKING
ABOUT KISSING GIRLS.

19:02.141 --> 19:05.715
WE WERE, I DON'T KNOW, 8...
MAYBE 12.

19:05.715 --> 19:08.218
ANYWAY, HE HAD--HE HAD
LONG HAIR, KIND OF LIKE A GIRL.

19:08.218 --> 19:11.521
WE, UM, PRACTICED KISSING
ON EACH OTHER...

19:11.521 --> 19:13.253
ONE TIME.

19:13.253 --> 19:15.255
WITH YOUR COUSIN BEN?

19:15.255 --> 19:16.786
YEAH.

19:16.786 --> 19:20.530
THAT IS
INTERESTING INFORMATION.

19:20.530 --> 19:21.891
HEY!

19:21.891 --> 19:24.334
HEY!
YOU READY TO GO
TO THE MOVIE?

19:24.334 --> 19:26.396
YEAH, LET'S ROLL.

19:26.396 --> 19:28.238
в™Єв™Є

19:28.238 --> 19:30.770
I WARNED YOU
NOT TO MESS WITH ME.

19:30.770 --> 19:34.574
в™Єв™Є

19:34.574 --> 19:36.346
(door opens and closes)

19:36.346 --> 19:39.349
IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL
ANY BETTER,

19:39.349 --> 19:42.282
HE GOT ME TO MARCH
IN TWO PRIDE PARADES WITH HIM.

19:42.282 --> 19:44.284
OH, BOY.

19:44.284 --> 19:46.256
THANKS FOR BUYING US
ALL MATCHING FAT PANTS

19:46.256 --> 19:47.357
FROM THE GIFT SHOP.

19:47.357 --> 19:49.719
WHOO!
(all) FATTIES!

19:49.719 --> 19:53.723
IT WAS THE BEST 800 BUCKS
I EVER SPENT.
(laughs) YOU CRACK ME UP.

19:53.723 --> 19:55.895
WAIT. YOU JUST SAID
SOMETHING NICE TO HER.

19:55.895 --> 19:57.897
WELL, WHEN YOU WERE GONE,
WE TALKED,

19:57.897 --> 20:01.200
AND, WELL, WE BONDED A LITTLE.
REALLY?

20:01.200 --> 20:04.504
DID YOU KNOW THAT WHEN WE
WERE KIDS, WE BOTH HAD HORSES?

20:04.504 --> 20:07.206
I DID. HOW DID I
NOT USE THAT BEFORE?

20:07.206 --> 20:09.379
I MEAN, ALL HORSE PEOPLE
LOVE EACH OTHER.

20:09.379 --> 20:12.342
SOMETIMES IT JUST TAKES
A CRAPPY NIGHT FOR TWO PEOPLE

20:12.342 --> 20:14.914
TO REALIZE HOW CLOSE
THEY ALREADY ARE.

20:14.914 --> 20:17.717
(gasps) AW, BUDDY.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.321
THIS IS FAKE!

20:21.321 --> 20:23.793
OHH! I TOLD YOU
SHE WOULDN'T BUY IT.
(sighs)

20:23.793 --> 20:27.427
JULES, I TRIED, BUT COME ON. SHE
NAMED HER HORSE LIMP BIZKIT!

20:27.427 --> 20:29.228
BECAUSE HE ROCKED!

20:29.228 --> 20:32.262
HE ROCKED.
SO THIS IS THE WAY
IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE

20:32.262 --> 20:34.434
WITH MY TWO BEST FRIENDS?
BINGO.

20:34.434 --> 20:36.466
RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT.
OH, WOW.

20:36.466 --> 20:39.409
OH, IT DOESN'T MATTER.
WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE YOUR BACK.

20:39.409 --> 20:42.342
WE WILL KICK ASS
AND TAKE NAMES.
THANK YOU.

20:42.342 --> 20:44.414
(knock on door)

20:44.414 --> 20:46.416
в™Єв™Є

20:46.416 --> 20:50.019
YOU REQUESTED
TURNDOWN SERVICE?
YEAH, JUST HAND OVER
THE CHOCOLATES.

20:50.019 --> 20:54.253
HEY, DID YOU KNOW TODAY
IS MY 34th BIRTHDAY?
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.725
OH!

20:55.725 --> 20:59.258
(door closes)
WHOO-HOO!
THIS WAS THE BEST BIRTHDAY...

20:59.258 --> 21:00.990
(cheering)
EVER!

21:00.990 --> 21:03.363
(chanting) 34! 34! 34!
34! 34!

21:09.369 --> 21:11.040
I THINK YOU KNOW
WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY.

21:11.040 --> 21:13.973
TRAVIS HAS OBTAINED CERTAIN
INFORMATION ABOUT YOU, GRAYSON,

21:13.973 --> 21:15.975
THAT YOU WOULD PREFER
TO KEEP PRIVATE.

21:15.975 --> 21:18.808
NOW TRAVIS IS WILLING TO KEEP
SAID INFO LOCKED UP FOR ETERNITY

21:18.808 --> 21:21.351
FOR THE ASKING PRICE
OF $50 AMERICAN.

21:21.351 --> 21:24.314
HOW DO WE KNOW HE HASN'T
ALREADY TOLD PEOPLE?

21:24.314 --> 21:26.616
I'VE BEEN BEGGING HIM
TO TELL ME ALL MORNING.

21:26.616 --> 21:28.618
I'VE GOTTEN NOTHING.

21:28.618 --> 21:30.760
FINE.

21:30.760 --> 21:32.322
IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE.

21:32.322 --> 21:35.325
DUDE, YOUR COUSIN?
HOW GAY IS THAT? (chuckles)

21:35.325 --> 21:37.327
YO, TRAV, WAIT UP.
