WEBVTT

00:01.202 --> 00:03.071
- IN THE CRIMINAL
JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:03.104 --> 00:06.774
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:06.807 --> 00:09.510
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:09.543 --> 00:11.379
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:11.412 --> 00:12.746
ARE MEMBERS
OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:12.780 --> 00:14.682
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:14.715 --> 00:17.585
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.053
[elevator bell dings]

00:19.087 --> 00:21.055
- DON'T FORGET.
IT'S FAMILY NIGHT TONIGHT.

00:21.089 --> 00:22.256
- I DON'T WANNA WATCH
THAT DUMB SHOW

00:22.290 --> 00:24.192
WHERE CELEBRITIES
DO THE TANGO.

00:24.225 --> 00:25.826
- DAD WANTS TO PLAY
A BOARD GAME.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.828
- NOT AGAIN!

00:27.861 --> 00:30.164
- I HAVE HOMEWORK.
- ME TOO.

00:30.198 --> 00:30.831
- LOOK, KIDS--

00:30.864 --> 00:33.634
[sighs]

00:33.667 --> 00:36.036
[quietly]
GREAT.

00:39.207 --> 00:41.075
BILL?

00:41.109 --> 00:42.210
YOU HERE?

00:42.243 --> 00:47.715
- [sniffling, panting]

00:47.748 --> 00:49.183
- [gasps]

00:49.217 --> 00:51.819
OH, MY GOD!

00:51.852 --> 00:54.322
- CALL THE COPS.

00:54.355 --> 00:55.423
- VICTIM'S NAME
IS BILL DIXON.

00:55.456 --> 00:56.824
WIFE FOUND HIM STRIPPED
AND BOUND.

00:56.857 --> 00:59.560
HE RUNS SOME KIND OF
LEATHER GOODS COMPANY.

00:59.593 --> 01:01.695
- DID HE SEE HIS ATTACKER?
- HE DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

01:01.729 --> 01:03.097
LAST THING HE REMEMBERS,

01:03.131 --> 01:05.099
HE WAS SETTING UP A GAME
FOR FAMILY NIGHT.

01:05.133 --> 01:07.401
- WELL, THERE'S NO SIGN HERE
OF FORCED ENTRY.

01:07.435 --> 01:09.870
- YEAH, SOMEBODY EITHER
PICKED THE LOCK OR HAD A KEY.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.173
DOORMAN DIDN'T SEE ANYONE
COME OR GO

01:12.206 --> 01:13.441
THAT WASN'T A REGULAR.

01:13.474 --> 01:16.210
- SECURITY CAMERAS?
- ONLY ON THE ELEVATORS.

01:16.244 --> 01:18.879
NINE FOLKS WENT UP BETWEEN
6:00 AND 8:00 P.M.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.415
ALL TENANTS.
NONE GOT OFF ON THE 12TH FLOOR.

01:21.449 --> 01:23.284
- SO OUR PERP
WAS SPIDER-MAN.

01:23.317 --> 01:24.485
- FROM THE WAY DIXON LOOKS,

01:24.518 --> 01:26.887
I'D SAY CASPER
THE UNFRIENDLY GHOST.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.322
- ONE MINUTE,
I'M WAITING FOR MY WIFE

01:28.356 --> 01:30.324
AND KIDS TO COME HOME AND...

01:30.358 --> 01:32.460
THE NEXT,
I'M TIED UP ON THE FLOOR.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.495
- YOU DIDN'T HEAR A VOICE
OR THE DOOR OPENING?

01:34.528 --> 01:36.197
- THE MADMAN WHO DID THIS
IS STILL OUT THERE.

01:36.230 --> 01:38.299
WHY AREN'T YOU
SEARCHING FOR HIM?

01:38.332 --> 01:40.768
- FIN, HOW 'BOUT YOU TAKE
MRS. DIXON TO CHECK ON THE KIDS?

01:40.801 --> 01:42.236
- I WANNA STAY HERE
WITH YOU.

01:42.270 --> 01:43.904
- HONEY, PLEASE.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.906
- CAN HE TALK TO US
JUST A MINUTE?

01:45.939 --> 01:47.675
THANKS.

01:47.708 --> 01:51.345
IT'S A...HELL OF A WAY
TO START FAMILY NIGHT, HUH?

01:51.379 --> 01:53.381
- WHAT ABOUT MY KIDS?

01:53.414 --> 01:55.349
THEY'LL BE SAFE, RIGHT?

01:55.383 --> 01:58.519
- IF YOU TELL US
THE REAL STORY.

01:58.552 --> 02:00.188
- YOU THINK
I'M HIDING SOMETHING?

02:00.221 --> 02:03.491
- WHATEVER YOU'RE
COVERING ON YOUR CHEST.

02:03.524 --> 02:05.493
- IT'S NOTHING.

02:05.526 --> 02:08.396
- SO THEN YOU WON'T MIND
IF I TAKE A PEEK?

02:16.704 --> 02:18.606
- "RUINER."
- WHAT DOES...

02:18.639 --> 02:20.574
THAT MEAN?
I'VE--UHH...

02:21.909 --> 02:24.545
- HIS PULSE IS LOW.
- LET'S GET HIM TO THE HOSPITAL!

03:17.665 --> 03:19.467
- MR. DIXON SLEPT
REASONABLY WELL LAST NIGHT,

03:19.500 --> 03:22.370
DESPITE TWO FRACTURED RIBS
AND NUMEROUS CONTUSIONS.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.738
- NOT TO MENTION
THE CATTLE BRAND ON HIS CHEST.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.974
- I'VE SEEN A LOT OF TATS
AND PIERCINGS GO WRONG,

03:27.007 --> 03:29.643
BUT THIS ONE'S NEW TO ME.
- PERP USED A WIRE HANGER.

03:29.677 --> 03:32.012
WE'RE THINKING THAT HE USED
A BLOWTORCH TO FIRE-TIP THE END.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.648
- WELL, HE'S LUCKY THE BURNS
ARE ONLY SECOND-DEGREE.

03:34.682 --> 03:36.284
- SO WHAT ABOUT HIS HEAD?
CONCUSSION?

03:36.317 --> 03:38.286
- NO NEURAL SIGNS.
NO TRAUMA.

03:38.319 --> 03:39.853
- SO HOW WAS HE KNOCKED COLD?
- KETAMINE.

03:39.887 --> 03:41.289
IT'S A VETERINARY
TRANQUILIZER.

03:41.322 --> 03:43.457
HE HAD A PUNCTURE WOUND
AT THE BASE OF HIS NECK.

03:43.491 --> 03:45.526
- SO HE WAS DRUGGED FROM BEHIND.
- AND VIOLATED.

03:45.559 --> 03:48.362
I FOUND SEVERAL UNUSUAL OBJECTS
INSERTED INTO HIS RECTUM.

03:48.396 --> 03:50.331
- AS OPPOSED
TO THE USUAL ONES.

03:50.364 --> 03:51.265
- WELL, YOU'D BE SURPRISED

03:51.299 --> 03:53.334
WHAT PEOPLE SAY
THEY SLIPPED AND FELL ON--

03:53.367 --> 03:55.769
SODA BOTTLES, FLASHLIGHTS,
ASSORTED FRUITS AND VEGETABLES.

03:55.803 --> 03:56.904
BUT NEVER THIS.

03:56.937 --> 03:59.873
THREE DICE
AND A LITTLE TIMER.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.009
- FROM A BOARD GAME.

04:02.042 --> 04:03.544
SO OUR PERP'S A SORE LOSER.

04:03.577 --> 04:06.580
- MM-HMM. MAYBE BILL
CAN TELL ME WHY.

04:06.614 --> 04:08.549
- I'M SORRY
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

04:08.582 --> 04:11.385
I FELT SO...EMBARRASSED.

04:11.419 --> 04:13.020
- YOU WERE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED.

04:13.053 --> 04:15.456
THERE'S NOTHING
TO FEEL EMBARRASSED ABOUT.

04:15.489 --> 04:18.592
- THE WHOLE THING
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

04:18.626 --> 04:20.394
- SO YOU HAVE NO IDEA

04:20.428 --> 04:22.396
WHY SOMEONE WOULD
BRAND YOU A RUINER?

04:22.430 --> 04:24.432
- NO.
- BECAUSE YOU GOT TO ADMIT,

04:24.465 --> 04:27.868
IT'S A...
PRETTY STRANGE WORD.

04:27.901 --> 04:29.503
- WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

04:29.537 --> 04:31.038
- I'M JUST TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED.

04:31.071 --> 04:32.606
- YOU THINK I'M LYING?

04:32.640 --> 04:34.375
- THERE'S NO EVIDENCE

04:34.408 --> 04:36.310
THAT ANYONE FORCED THEIR WAY
INTO YOUR APARTMENT,

04:36.344 --> 04:38.812
WHICH MEANS THAT EITHER
YOU LET THEM IN

04:38.846 --> 04:42.383
OR SOMEONE HAD A KEY.

04:42.416 --> 04:43.684
ARE YOU HAVING
AN AFFAIR, BILL?

04:43.717 --> 04:45.986
- NEVER.

04:46.019 --> 04:47.120
- BILL WOULD NEVER CHEAT
ON ME.

04:47.154 --> 04:50.458
WE HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP.
THE SEX IS FANTASTIC.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.526
- CAN YOU THINK OF ANYBODY
THAT MIGHT WANT TO HURT HIM,

04:52.560 --> 04:54.328
A BUSINESS RIVAL, MAYBE?

04:54.362 --> 04:56.029
- NO. NOT THAT I KNOW OF.

04:56.063 --> 04:58.098
- NO RUN-INS WITH THE LAW,
AN ARREST?

04:58.131 --> 05:01.569
- BILL'S NEVER HAD SO MUCH
AS A PARKING TICKET.

05:01.602 --> 05:03.671
- SO THIS ASSAULT
IS A TOTAL MYSTERY TO YOU.

05:03.704 --> 05:07.341
- YOU'RE INTERROGATING ME
LIKE I'M THE PERP

05:07.375 --> 05:10.043
WHILE THERE'S SOME HOMOSEXUAL
NUTCASE ON THE LOOSE?

05:10.077 --> 05:11.912
- WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
THE PERP'S HOMOSEXUAL?

05:11.945 --> 05:14.748
- HE SHOVED GAME PIECES
UP MY ASS.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.584
- AFTER HE DRUGGED YOU.
- YES.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.852
- AND THEN BRANDED YOUR CHEST.
- I'M NOT THE CRIMINAL HERE!

05:18.886 --> 05:20.087
- I'M NOT SAYING YOU ARE,
BILL,

05:20.120 --> 05:22.122
BUT SOMEONE WENT TO
AN AWFUL LOT OF TROUBLE

05:22.155 --> 05:23.491
TO DO THIS TO YOU.

05:23.524 --> 05:25.559
NOW, HELP ME OUT HERE.

05:25.593 --> 05:28.662
DID YOU PISS SOMEONE OFF?

05:28.696 --> 05:32.900
SOMETHING TO MAKE THEM
WANNA RETALIATE IN THIS FASHION?

05:32.933 --> 05:34.468
- IT COULD HAVE BEEN
JONAS ROTHENBERG.

05:34.502 --> 05:35.969
Benson: WHO'S THAT?

05:36.003 --> 05:39.673
- THE PRESIDENT OF THE CROOKED
POND GREENBELT ASSOCIATION.

05:41.141 --> 05:44.378
ROTHENBERG AND HIS
ENVIRO-NAZI FRIENDS

05:44.412 --> 05:46.747
TRIED TO STOP BILL
FROM MAKING SNAKESKIN BELTS.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.015
- HOW?

05:48.048 --> 05:49.282
- WROTE HIM A THREATENING
LETTER.

05:49.316 --> 05:53.020
HE SAID BILL WAS GOING TO PAY
FOR DESTROYING THE ENVIRONMENT,

05:53.053 --> 05:57.057
THAT BILL RUINED
EVERYTHING HE TOUCHED.

05:57.090 --> 05:59.393
- DOES ROTHENBERG
HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR BUILDING?

05:59.427 --> 06:00.928
- WELL, MY DAUGHTER
FOUND THAT LETTER

06:00.961 --> 06:02.963
TAPED TO OUR APARTMENT DOOR.

06:02.996 --> 06:05.433
SOMEHOW HE GOT IN.

06:07.468 --> 06:09.637
- I SNUCK INTO THEIR BUILDING
WHILE THE DOORMAN WAS ASLEEP

06:09.670 --> 06:11.805
AND USED THE BACK STAIRS.

06:11.839 --> 06:14.141
AND...I'D DO IT AGAIN
IF I HAD TO.

06:14.174 --> 06:16.143
- BECAUSE BILL DIXON
RUINS EVERYTHING?

06:16.176 --> 06:19.046
- HE DIDN'T HAVE THE PROPER
PERMITS TO TRAP WILDLIFE.

06:19.079 --> 06:22.149
WHEN THE LETTER DIDN'T WORK,
I TOOK HIM TO COURT.

06:22.182 --> 06:24.552
- YOU SOUND LIKE YOU STILL WANT
A POUND OF FLESH FROM THIS GUY.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.487
- I'M OUTRAGED
OVER THE CRUELTY

06:26.520 --> 06:30.157
WE INFLICT ON ANIMALS!

06:30.190 --> 06:32.426
RAINCOATS
MADE FROM EEL SKIN?

06:32.460 --> 06:33.861
EARRINGS MADE FROM
BAT TESTICLES?

06:33.894 --> 06:36.564
IN SOME COUNTRIES, THEY EVEN
SKIN DOGS FOR FUR COLLARS.

06:36.597 --> 06:39.833
- SO WHEN A JERK
LIKE BILL DIXON GETS HASSLED...

06:39.867 --> 06:41.835
- HASSLED? I'D LIKE TO SEE HIM
GET CAUGHT

06:41.869 --> 06:44.638
IN ONE OF THESE TRAPS--
LOOK AT THIS THING.

06:44.672 --> 06:46.173
[cell phone tone]
- LOOKS LIKE IT WAS MADE

06:46.206 --> 06:47.975
FROM A COAT HANGER.

06:48.008 --> 06:48.942
YEP.

06:48.976 --> 06:51.879
- WHERE WERE YOU LAST NIGHT,
MR. ROTHENBERG?

06:51.912 --> 06:56.083
- AT A LECTURE ON THE USE
OF ALGAE AS A SOURCE OF ENERGY.

06:56.116 --> 07:00.621
- MR. ROTHENBERG,
WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

07:00.654 --> 07:02.089
THAT WAS FIN.

07:02.122 --> 07:05.058
HE SAYS HE MAY KNOW HOW OUR
PERP GOT INTO DIXON'S BUILDING.

07:05.092 --> 07:06.994
- THE SUPER SAID THE BOX
WAS DELIVERED

07:07.027 --> 07:09.129
AT 5:32 LAST NIGHT.

07:09.162 --> 07:10.931
- THAT'S TWO HOURS
BEFORE DIXON WAS ATTACKED.

07:10.964 --> 07:13.801
WHO WAS IT SENT TO?
- TO THE SUPER.

07:13.834 --> 07:15.803
HE THOUGHT IT WAS AN INDUSTRIAL
VACUUM HE ORDERED.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.237
HE PUT IT DOWN HERE
IN THE STOREROOM.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.106
WHEN HE CAME IN THIS MORNING,
IT WAS OPEN AND EMPTY.

07:19.139 --> 07:21.208
- PERP HAD HIMSELF
DELIVERED LAST NIGHT.

07:21.241 --> 07:23.744
- IT'S A GOOD WAY
TO AVOID THE DOORMAN.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.112
- AND SECURITY CAMERAS.

07:25.145 --> 07:27.214
THIS STOREROOM'S CONNECTED
TO THE BACK STAIRWAY.

07:27.247 --> 07:30.150
- OKAY.
WHO SENT THE BOX?

07:30.183 --> 07:32.786
- LOCAL FREIGHT COMPANY.
TRANSFER TO GO.

07:32.820 --> 07:35.756
- UH...YEP.
THERE'S A DELIVERY ORDER

07:35.789 --> 07:38.191
IN THE SYSTEM
FROM VAC-ATTACK INDUSTRIES

07:38.225 --> 07:39.192
FOR THIS MORNING.

07:39.226 --> 07:41.128
- THAT'S WHEN THE REAL VACUUM
WAS DELIVERED

07:41.161 --> 07:42.896
TO THE DIXONS' APARTMENT.

07:42.930 --> 07:45.232
- WE'RE LOOKING FOR A DUPLICATE
DELIVERY ORDER, CAMILLE,

07:45.265 --> 07:46.967
FOR LAST NIGHT.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.902
- OKAY. UH...

07:48.936 --> 07:50.137
YOU'RE RIGHT.

07:50.170 --> 07:53.874
ANOTHER JOB FROM VAC-ATTACK
TO THE SAME ADDRESS LAST NIGHT.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.643
- GREAT. DOES THE COMPUTER
TELL YOU WHO PUT THE ORDER IN?

07:55.676 --> 07:56.777
- THERE'S NO NAME, BUT, UH...

07:56.810 --> 08:00.047
ACTUALLY, THE IP ADDRESS
ON THIS ORDER ISN'T OURS, SO...

08:00.080 --> 08:02.550
- SO SOMEONE LOGGED IN
FROM A DIFFERENT LOCATION.

08:02.583 --> 08:05.018
- OR HACKED IN.

08:05.052 --> 08:07.120
- WHOEVER DID THIS IS A GENIUS.
- WELL, AREN'T THEY ALL?

08:07.154 --> 08:09.189
- NO, I'M TALKING
BLACK HAT HACKER HERE.

08:09.222 --> 08:11.291
HE BREACHED
A PACKET-FILTERING FIREWALL,

08:11.324 --> 08:13.293
INFILTRATED TRANSFER TO GO'S
COMPUTER SYSTEM

08:13.326 --> 08:15.295
BY CREATING TROJAN HORSE FILES.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.830
- AND HE DID IT OFF-SITE.

08:16.864 --> 08:18.899
- I TRIED TO TRIANGULATE
THE HACKER'S LOCATION

08:18.932 --> 08:20.300
USING THE IP ADDRESS...

08:20.333 --> 08:22.302
BUT HE CLONED IT
MULTIPLE TIMES.

08:22.335 --> 08:25.205
ONLY THING I GOT WAS TRANCHITO'S
PIZZA ON 14TH STREET.

08:25.238 --> 08:27.174
PLACE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE WIFI.

08:27.207 --> 08:30.077
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
JONAS ROTHENBERG?

08:30.110 --> 08:31.979
- [sighs]
SEEMS MOTIVATED.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.181
- NOT ENOUGH TO BE
IN TWO PLACES AT ONCE.

08:34.214 --> 08:36.183
ROTHENBERG'S ALIBI CHECKS OUT.

08:36.216 --> 08:37.985
A DOZEN PEOPLE SAW HIM
LEARNING ALL ABOUT ALGAE

08:38.018 --> 08:38.986
FROM 7:00 TO 10:00.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.288
- AND WE'RE SURE DIXON
WASN'T HAVING AN AFFAIR.

08:41.321 --> 08:43.891
- CHECKED HIS BACKGROUND,
DUMPED HIS PHONES.

08:43.924 --> 08:45.258
NO JILTED LOVERS.

08:45.292 --> 08:47.628
EXCEPT FOR THE TREE HUGGERS,
HE'S MR. POPULAR.

08:47.661 --> 08:48.929
- WELL...

08:48.962 --> 08:51.298
YOU DON'T GET "RUINER"
BRANDED ON YOUR CHEST

08:51.331 --> 08:53.166
FOR BEING WELL-LIKED.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.135
LET'S TAKE ANOTHER RUN
AT MR. DIXON.

08:55.168 --> 08:57.304
- HE'LL HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE.

08:57.337 --> 08:59.907
WE GOT ANOTHER VICTIM.

09:01.842 --> 09:03.176
- VICTOR RAMOS.
35.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.012
DAUGHTERS FOUND HIM
TRUSSED AND BOUND

09:05.045 --> 09:06.614
JUST LIKE THE GUY
ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.616
- WITNESSES?
- NOBODY SAW ANYTHING.

09:15.789 --> 09:17.124
- "TRAITOR."

09:23.997 --> 09:26.734
- I WAS IN THE KITCHEN
COOKING DINNER FOR MY DAUGHTERS.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.168
THEY WERE COMING HOME
FROM SOCCER PRACTICE

09:28.201 --> 09:30.704
IN HALF AN HOUR.

09:30.738 --> 09:34.875
AND THEN, UM...

09:34.908 --> 09:36.276
- TAKE YOUR TIME, MR. RAMOS.

09:36.309 --> 09:39.312
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

09:42.716 --> 09:44.618
- I HEARD SOMETHING BEHIND ME,

09:44.652 --> 09:46.654
AND I FELT A SHARP PAIN
IN MY NECK.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.789
- YOUR ATTACKER DRUGGED YOU
WITH A TRANQUILIZER.

09:48.822 --> 09:52.660
- AND THEN WHEN I WOKE UP,
MY HANDS AND MY FEET WERE TIED.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.828
MY CHEST WAS BURNED.

09:54.862 --> 09:55.996
- RIGHT,
WITH THE WORD "TRAITOR."

09:56.029 --> 09:58.031
NOW...ANY IDEA
WHAT THAT'S ABOUT?

09:58.065 --> 10:01.034
- NO.
I'VE NEVER BETRAYED ANYONE.

10:01.068 --> 10:03.837
I'M A GOOD MAN.

10:07.007 --> 10:10.077
WHY WOULD HE USE A CANDLE
FROM MY KITCHEN--

10:10.110 --> 10:11.945
- TO SEXUALLY ASSAULT YOU?

10:11.979 --> 10:13.914
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.649
WHY DON'T WE START WITH WORK?

10:15.683 --> 10:17.117
OKAY...
WHAT IS IT YOU DO?

10:17.150 --> 10:19.352
- I'M A TAX ACCOUNTANT.

10:19.386 --> 10:22.923
- AND IS THERE ANYONE...

10:22.956 --> 10:25.759
A CLIENT, A BUSINESS RIVAL
THAT'S ANGRY WITH YOU?

10:25.793 --> 10:27.060
- NO.

10:27.094 --> 10:29.396
- OKAY. OUTSIDE OF WORK?

10:29.429 --> 10:30.964
- NO.

10:30.998 --> 10:33.233
- I'M JUST TRYING TO FIND
A POSSIBLE MOTIVE HERE.

10:33.266 --> 10:35.936
- I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

10:38.739 --> 10:41.274
MY WIFE DIED OF A BRAIN TUMOR
TWO YEARS AGO.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.876
- I'M SORRY.

10:42.910 --> 10:45.078
- I'M DATING A WOMAN
FROM MY CHURCH.

10:45.112 --> 10:47.848
MY DAUGHTERS,
THEY BOTH GO TO ST. GERALD'S.

10:47.881 --> 10:50.117
I'VE NEVER BEEN
A TRAITOR TO ANYONE.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.820
- OKAY.
MR. RAMOS...

10:54.287 --> 10:57.024
DO YOU KNOW THAT MAN?

10:58.158 --> 11:00.293
- NO.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.095
SHOULD I?

11:02.129 --> 11:04.698
- WELL, HIS ANGUISH
IS CERTAINLY GENUINE.

11:04.732 --> 11:07.134
- WHAT ABOUT HIS STORY?
- I'M NOT A LIE DETECTOR.

11:07.167 --> 11:10.070
IS THERE ANY CONNECTION
BETWEEN HIM AND BILL DIXON?

11:10.103 --> 11:13.040
- NO COMMON FRIENDS, THEY ATTEND
DIFFERENT CHURCHES, CLUBS.

11:13.073 --> 11:15.108
- THE PERP BROKE INTO
THEIR HOMES,

11:15.142 --> 11:16.476
DRUGGED THEM WITH KETAMINE,

11:16.509 --> 11:19.813
AND THEN PENETRATED THEM
WITH FOREIGN OBJECTS.

11:19.847 --> 11:21.882
HE TARGETED THEM.
- WELL, YOU'RE ASSUMING

11:21.915 --> 11:23.751
THAT THE PERPETRATOR
ISN'T DELUSIONAL.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.152
SOMETHING ABOUT THE VICTIMS
COULD HAVE SET HIM OFF.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.988
- HE BRANDED THEM WITH
"RUINER," "TRAITOR."

11:28.021 --> 11:29.322
THIS IS ABOUT REVENGE.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.124
- I'M JUST NOT BUYING THIS
AS A COINCIDENCE.

11:31.158 --> 11:33.093
THERE HAS TO BE A CONNECTION.

11:33.126 --> 11:34.795
- WELL, IF MR. RAMOS
AND MR. DIXON

11:34.828 --> 11:36.129
VICTIMIZED THEIR ATTACKER
TOGETHER,

11:36.163 --> 11:37.998
THEY'RE NOT GONNA COP
TO KNOWING EACH OTHER.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.499
BUT AT SOME POINT,

11:39.532 --> 11:41.034
THEY MAY FEEL THE NEED
TO REACH OUT TO ONE ANOTHER.

11:41.068 --> 11:43.436
- YOU SAYING THAT WE SHOULD
TAIL THE VICTIMS?

11:43.470 --> 11:45.105
- THAT'S ABOUT
ALL YOU CAN DO.

11:45.138 --> 11:47.207
- WELL, RAMOS AND DIXON
HAVE SEEN US.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.909
- YEAH.
BUT THEY HAVEN'T SEEN FIN.

12:01.454 --> 12:03.757
[arguing indistinctly]

12:03.791 --> 12:05.893
- YOU JUST NEED TO KEEP
YOUR MOUTH SHUT, OKAY?

12:17.204 --> 12:19.773
- SMILE, DIRTBAGS.

12:19.807 --> 12:22.209
RAMOS WENT STRAIGHT
FROM HERE TO GAMMON IMPORTS

12:22.242 --> 12:23.877
ON 68TH AND PARK.

12:23.911 --> 12:25.946
BILL DIXON WAS ALREADY THERE.

12:25.979 --> 12:27.014
- WHO'S THE GUY
THEY'RE DUMPIN' ON?

12:27.047 --> 12:30.183
- THAT'S THE IMPORTER HIMSELF,
ALEXANDER GAMMON.

12:30.217 --> 12:32.252
- SO THE SECOND THAT RAMOS
LEAVES US, HE MEETS DIXON,

12:32.285 --> 12:34.888
WHO HE SWEARS HE'S NEVER
SEEN BEFORE IN HIS LIFE,

12:34.922 --> 12:36.456
AND THIS GUY GAMMON.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.225
- AND BOY, DIXON SEEMS
ESPECIALLY UPSET HERE.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.960
- AND SCARED.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.261
- ANYBODY MAKE OUT
WHAT HE'S SAYING?

12:41.294 --> 12:44.531
- WELL, GAMMON'S WEARING
A $2,000 ARMANI.

12:44.564 --> 12:46.466
I DOUBT DIXON'S TELLING HIM
IT'S A NICE SUIT.

12:46.499 --> 12:49.002
- I'D SWEAR DIXON'S SAYING,
"YOU'RE NEXT."

12:49.036 --> 12:51.004
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE
IF GAMMON CAN EXPLAIN

12:51.038 --> 12:54.274
WHY HE WAS IN A SCREAMING
MATCH WITH OUR VICTIMS.

12:56.209 --> 12:58.078
- I'M SORRY, DETECTIVES.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.580
I DON'T KNOW A MR. RAMOS
OR A MR. DIXON.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.983
- SO YOU'RE JUST ARGUING
WITH TWO GUYS

13:03.016 --> 13:05.318
THAT YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.156
- FINE.

13:09.189 --> 13:13.193
VICTOR, BILL, AND I WERE
HAVING A BUSINESS DISCUSSION.

13:13.226 --> 13:15.863
- CONFIDENTIAL?

13:15.896 --> 13:17.831
- TRUST IS THE LUBRICANT

13:17.865 --> 13:20.100
THAT KEEPS THE WHEELS
OF COMMERCE TURNING.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.969
I HAVE TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY

13:22.002 --> 13:23.470
OF THE PEOPLE
I DO BUSINESS WITH.

13:23.503 --> 13:25.438
- WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS?

13:25.472 --> 13:27.875
- UH-UH, DETECTIVE.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.943
- THIS IS
A POLICE INVESTIGATION.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.244
SO WE'LL KEEP IT ON THE D.L.

13:31.278 --> 13:34.081
- OKAY. UH...

13:34.114 --> 13:35.849
BILL'S COMPANY
MAKES HIGH-END BELTS.

13:35.883 --> 13:38.451
I GIVE THEM AS CHRISTMAS GIFTS
TO MY CLIENTS.

13:38.485 --> 13:39.853
- AND MR. RAMOS?

13:39.887 --> 13:41.154
- WE HAVE AN OFFICE
IN PUERTO RICO.

13:41.188 --> 13:43.123
VICTOR SPEAKS FLUENT SPANISH

13:43.156 --> 13:46.093
AND DOES...ACCOUNTING WORK
ON AN AS-NEEDED BASIS.

13:46.126 --> 13:47.460
- THAT'S IT?

13:47.494 --> 13:49.997
YOU'RE BEING ALL HUSH-HUSH
ABOUT YOUR BELT SALESMAN

13:50.030 --> 13:51.498
AND A NUMBER CRUNCHER?

13:51.531 --> 13:54.902
- BIG OR SMALL, I MEAN,
COMPANY TRUST IS ESSENTIAL.

13:54.935 --> 13:57.871
- HOW LONG HAVE YOU
WORKED WITH THEM?

13:57.905 --> 13:59.039
- TEN YEARS.

13:59.072 --> 14:01.341
WHY ARE YOU SO INTERESTED
IN THEM?

14:01.374 --> 14:03.576
- WELL, BILL DIXON
AND VICTOR RAMOS

14:03.610 --> 14:05.645
WERE SODOMIZED AND BRANDED.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.981
- WELL, YOU THINK THAT HAS
SOMETHING TO DO WITH ME?

14:08.015 --> 14:10.083
- WE'RE JUST TRYING TO FIND
SOME CONNECTION BETWEEN THE TWO

14:10.117 --> 14:12.285
AND, UH...
YOU SEEM TO BE IT.

14:12.319 --> 14:14.955
- FOR ALL WE KNOW,
YOU COULD BE NEXT.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.623
- WE WOULDN'T WANT IT TO HAPPEN
TO ANOTHER INNOCENT PERSON.

14:16.656 --> 14:20.193
- SOMEONE WANTS TO BRAND ME...

14:20.227 --> 14:22.896
I SAY GIVE IT A SHOT.

14:22.930 --> 14:25.298
AND YES, I HAVE A PERMIT.

14:25.332 --> 14:26.967
NOW...

14:27.000 --> 14:29.236
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
DETECTIVES.

14:32.539 --> 14:33.941
- YOU BELIEVE A WORD OF THAT?

14:33.974 --> 14:35.375
- ONLY THE PART ABOUT
THE LUBRICANT.

14:35.408 --> 14:38.345
HE'S GONNA WISH HE HAD SOME
IF HE'S ATTACKED.

14:42.482 --> 14:45.953
- LOOKS LIKE GAMMON'S
ABOUT TO GET HOSED.

14:49.522 --> 14:52.692
- SO HOW LONG DO WE WAIT
FOR THIS JERK IN THE BOX?

14:52.725 --> 14:55.328
- AS LONG AS IT TAKES
TO CATCH HIM IN THE ACT.

15:13.981 --> 15:16.283
- DID YOU SEE THE BOX MOVE?

15:23.256 --> 15:25.392
- 7:45.
THE WITCHING HOUR.

15:49.349 --> 15:51.484
man 1 on TV: DOWN THE HALL
ON THE RIGHT. 113.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.320
man 2: WHAT ARE WE
MEETING HERE FOR?

15:53.353 --> 15:55.122
WHO LIVES HERE?

15:55.155 --> 15:57.024
- FINCHLEY.
- FINCHLEY?

15:57.057 --> 15:59.092
GEE WHIZ,
I THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD!

16:11.171 --> 16:12.372
- POLICE!
DON'T MOVE.

16:12.405 --> 16:14.574
- ALL RIGHT,
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

16:14.607 --> 16:17.377
TIME TO TALK.
- YOU GOT HIM?

16:17.410 --> 16:19.146
DROP THE SYRINGE.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.348
- AAH!

16:21.381 --> 16:23.616
- DROP IT.
DROP IT.

16:27.354 --> 16:29.656
YOU'RE THE GIRL
FROM TRANSFER TO GO--CAMILLE.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.791
- YOU'RE UNDER ARREST...

16:31.824 --> 16:36.163
FOR SODOMY AND ASSAULT
WITH A DEADLY WEAPON.

16:38.531 --> 16:40.633
- NOTHIN' TO SAY, HUH?

16:40.667 --> 16:44.037
NOTHING, NO DENIAL,
NO EXPLANATION.

16:45.305 --> 16:48.075
WELL, YOU DO HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.610
STILL,
I DID A LITTLE DIGGING.

16:50.643 --> 16:53.746
CAMILLE, YOUR MOM DIED
IN A CAR ACCIDENT

16:53.780 --> 16:55.248
WHEN YOU WERE FIVE...

16:55.282 --> 16:58.818
YOUR DAD REMANDED TO BELLEVUE
FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA.

16:58.851 --> 17:02.055
YOU BOUNCED AROUND
TO SIX FOSTER FAMILIES?

17:02.089 --> 17:04.124
AND PILE UP MULTIPLE ARRESTS

17:04.157 --> 17:07.260
FOR DRUG USE AND DELINQUENCY.

17:07.294 --> 17:08.695
ALL IN ALL,

17:08.728 --> 17:11.698
IT'S A PRETTY GOOD RESUME
FOR A LIFE OF CRIME.

17:11.731 --> 17:14.067
EXCEPT FOR ONE THING.

17:14.101 --> 17:17.737
AT 16, YOU TOOK
A STATE-ADMINISTERED IQ TEST

17:17.770 --> 17:21.174
AND SCORED
IN THE EXCEPTIONAL RANGE.

17:22.775 --> 17:26.213
PSYCHIATRISTS
FILED A REPORT.

17:26.246 --> 17:29.582
SAYS, "CAMILLE WALTERS'
PRODIGIOUS INTELLECT

17:29.616 --> 17:33.120
"IS MATCHED ONLY BY
HER AGGRESSIVE HATRED

17:33.153 --> 17:35.122
OF AUTHORITY FIGURES."

17:40.593 --> 17:43.230
HMM?

17:45.765 --> 17:48.768
SO TELL ME, CAMILLE...

17:50.503 --> 17:52.405
WHO ARE YOU?

17:59.146 --> 18:02.149
- I'M NOBODY.

18:02.182 --> 18:05.518
WHO ARE YOU?

18:05.552 --> 18:08.488
ARE YOU NOBODY TOO?

18:18.865 --> 18:20.867
- GENTLEMEN...

18:20.900 --> 18:24.204
MEET CAMILLE WALTERS.

18:24.237 --> 18:25.705
- THAT'S WHO YOU RAN ME
OUT OF MY APARTMENT

18:25.738 --> 18:27.607
TO CATCH LAST NIGHT?
- YOU GOT IT.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.709
SHE WAS GONNA BRAND YOU
THE WAY SHE DID THEM.

18:29.742 --> 18:32.145
- THAT LITTLE THING COULD NOT
HAVE ATTACKED THESE GUYS.

18:32.179 --> 18:34.147
- WHAT DO YOU SAY, BILL?

18:34.181 --> 18:36.183
- NO WAY SHE DID IT.

18:36.216 --> 18:40.387
- NOW...YOU SAID THAT
YOU WERE UNCONSCIOUS.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.621
RIGHT?

18:41.654 --> 18:45.425
- THAT GIRL COULDN'T HOG-TIE
A 200-POUND MAN.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.394
- WELL...

18:47.427 --> 18:49.329
HOW 'BOUT YOU, MR. RAMOS?

18:49.362 --> 18:53.300
- I SUPPOSE
ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE.

18:53.333 --> 18:55.935
BUT I WAS ATTACKED BY A MAN.
I KNOW THAT.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.470
- LOOK, WE'VE NEVER
SEEN HER BEFORE.

18:57.504 --> 18:58.838
- NOW, IS THAT THE SAME WAY
MR. RAMOS

18:58.871 --> 19:01.474
NEVER SAW BILL UNTIL
WE FOLLOWED HIM TO YOU?

19:01.508 --> 19:03.443
- WHAT ARE YOU INSINUATING,
DETECTIVE?

19:03.476 --> 19:07.247
- I'M JUST REVIEWING THE FACTS,
MR. GAMMON.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.382
MS. WALTERS WENT AFTER
ALL THREE OF YOU

19:09.416 --> 19:11.951
WITH THE INTENTION
OF BRANDING YOU.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.920
SHE HAD TO HAVE A MOTIVE.

19:13.953 --> 19:15.522
- YEAH, SHE'S LOONEY TUNES.
THAT'S HER MOTIVE.

19:15.555 --> 19:17.690
- THAT GIRL IS OBVIOUSLY
MENTALLY ILL.

19:17.724 --> 19:19.626
- IS THAT YOUR STORY?

19:19.659 --> 19:22.429
THE ONE ALL THREE OF YOU
ARE STICKING WITH?

19:22.462 --> 19:23.530
- SO THAT'S HOW IT WORKS?

19:23.563 --> 19:25.698
YOU CAN'T MAKE A CASE SO...

19:25.732 --> 19:28.401
YOU HARASS THE VICTIMS?

19:28.435 --> 19:30.703
THIS IS AMATEUR HOUR.

19:30.737 --> 19:32.772
LET'S GO, FELLAS.

19:32.805 --> 19:35.542
I'M BUYING BREAKFAST.

19:37.477 --> 19:39.412
- THEY I.D. HER?

19:39.446 --> 19:41.948
- NO. AND WE CHECKED
THEIR BACKGROUNDS.

19:41.981 --> 19:44.817
NONE OF THEM HAVE ANY
CONNECTION TO CAMILLE WALTERS.

19:44.851 --> 19:47.554
- BUT WE GOT HER ON KIDNAPPING,
AGGRAVATED ASSAULT,

19:47.587 --> 19:49.422
SODOMY,
AND CRIMINAL TRESPASS.

19:49.456 --> 19:51.958
WE'RE DONE.

19:53.960 --> 19:56.263
- SO WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?

19:56.296 --> 19:59.599
- HOW 'BOUT NOWHERE?
I CAN'T PROSECUTE THIS CASE.

19:59.632 --> 20:01.634
- WELL, THAT'S A HELL OF
A "HOW DO YOU DO," COUNSELOR.

20:01.668 --> 20:04.237
ADA GILLIAN HARDWICKE,
MEET DETECTIVES

20:04.271 --> 20:05.605
OLIVIA BENSON
AND ELIOT STABLER.

20:05.638 --> 20:07.440
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU CAN'T PROSECUTE?

20:07.474 --> 20:09.442
- I MEAN I WISH I COULD, BUT
I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE.

20:09.476 --> 20:10.610
- IF YOU DON'T MIND
ME ASKING,

20:10.643 --> 20:12.445
IS THIS YOUR FIRST JOB?
- NO.

20:12.479 --> 20:15.415
I WAS IN THE BROOKLYN BLUE ZONE
WHEN YOUR D.A. POACHED ME.

20:15.448 --> 20:18.851
I HAVE TO SAY I'M GLAD HE DID.
I'M A BIG FAN OF YOUR UNIT.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.321
EH...THAT CAME OUT WRONG.

20:21.354 --> 20:24.257
- JILL HAD A LOT OF FANS
HERSELF IN BROOKLYN.

20:24.291 --> 20:25.725
CONVICTION RATE
OF OVER 90%.

20:25.758 --> 20:27.460
- 92%, BUT WHO'S COUNTING?

20:27.494 --> 20:30.263
- SO YOU CAN COUNT THIS ONE
AS OPEN AND SHUT.

20:30.297 --> 20:32.932
CAMILLE WALTERS
BROKE INTO GAMMON'S APARTMENT

20:32.965 --> 20:35.502
AND WAS ABOUT TO GIVE ELLIOT
A COAT HANGER TATTOO.

20:35.535 --> 20:37.470
- AND WE HAVE HER TOOLKIT,

20:37.504 --> 20:39.306
WHICH LINKS HER
TO THE OTHER TWO ATTACKS.

20:39.339 --> 20:40.540
- NO, NOT EXACTLY.

20:40.573 --> 20:43.476
I HAD YOUR TARU TECH MORALES
DUMP THE GPS ON CAMILLE'S PHONE.

20:43.510 --> 20:46.413
IT HAS HER AT A MIDTOWN MACY'S
AND A HARLEM TARGET

20:46.446 --> 20:48.515
AT THE EXACT TIMES
OF THE FIRST TWO ATTACKS.

20:48.548 --> 20:50.517
STORE COMPUTERS BACK IT UP
WITH DEBIT CARD SWIPES.

20:50.550 --> 20:52.285
- SHE'S A HACKER.
SHE'S A GOOD ONE.

20:52.319 --> 20:54.454
- NOT TO MENTION THE MEN
SHE ALLEGEDLY ATTACKED

20:54.487 --> 20:55.888
COULDN'T I.D. HER.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.857
- OR WOULDN'T.
- WE STILL HAVE HER

20:57.890 --> 21:00.627
ON CRIMINAL TRESPASS
AT ALEXANDER GAMMON'S.

21:00.660 --> 21:02.329
- WHOSE LAWYER SAYS HE
DOESN'T WANT TO PRESS CHARGES.

21:02.362 --> 21:04.331
- THOSE MEN DID SOMETHING
TO MAKE CAMILLE ATTACK THEM.

21:04.364 --> 21:06.466
- I NEVER THOUGHT I'D HEAR YOU
BLAME THE VICTIMS, OLIVIA.

21:06.499 --> 21:09.602
- I JUST FEEL THAT CAMILLE
IS THE REAL VICTIM HERE.

21:09.636 --> 21:10.637
- HOW DO WE PROVE IT?

21:10.670 --> 21:11.671
- IF CAMILLE HAD A REASON
TO ATTACK THOSE MEN,

21:11.704 --> 21:13.673
WE MIGHT FIND A CLUE
IN HER METHOD OF ASSAULTS.

21:13.706 --> 21:16.743
- THE BRANDING.
- WHATEVER THE INCIDENT WAS,

21:16.776 --> 21:17.810
CAMILLE HERSELF WAS BRANDED.

21:17.844 --> 21:20.079
SHE MIGHT HAVE SUFFERED
FROM NIGHTMARE FLASHBACKS,

21:20.112 --> 21:22.815
PANIC ATTACKS, BOUTS OF
STRESSFUL HYPERVIGILANCE.

21:22.849 --> 21:24.417
- WELL, WE WENT BACK A DECADE

21:24.451 --> 21:25.752
TO TRY AND FIND
SOME KIND OF CONNECTION.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.987
MAYBE THESE GUYS
KNEW HER FROM EARLIER.

21:28.020 --> 21:30.323
- AND SHE SUPPRESSED HER ANGER
FOR ALL THESE YEARS.

21:30.357 --> 21:31.824
- SO WHY TAKE VENGEANCE
ON THEM NOW?

21:31.858 --> 21:34.060
- SOME CATALYST MUST HAVE
BROUGHT IT BACK TO THE SURFACE.

21:34.093 --> 21:36.863
- OKAY, WHAT KIND OF CATALYST?
- I DON'T KNOW.

21:36.896 --> 21:38.331
BUT OFTEN IN CASES

21:38.365 --> 21:40.367
WHERE A VICTIM SUPPRESSES
A TERRIBLE MEMORY,

21:40.400 --> 21:42.835
THEY KEEP A PHYSICAL REMINDER
OF THEIR SECRET--

21:42.869 --> 21:44.537
A MARKER OF SORTS.

21:44.571 --> 21:47.407
- DON'T RELEASE CAMILLE
FROM THE TOMBS JUST YET.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.642
- AND, UH, GET US
A SEARCH WARRANT.

21:49.676 --> 21:52.612
- WELCOME TO SPECIAL VICTIMS.

21:55.415 --> 21:57.617
- NOTHING THAT QUALIFIES
AS A MARKER.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.486
- UNLESS HACKING GEAR COUNTS.

22:00.653 --> 22:05.057
I'M STARTING TO THINK
WONG'S OFF THE MARK.

22:05.091 --> 22:07.660
- EL, LOOK AT THIS.

22:09.929 --> 22:12.599
- REPORT CARD
AND OLD PHOTOS.

22:14.601 --> 22:17.069
HER WITH HER DAD BEFORE HE WAS
SENT AWAY TO BELLEVUE?

22:17.103 --> 22:19.105
- WE'RE ALL BRANDED,
I GUESS,

22:19.138 --> 22:21.841
BY OUR PARENTS,
OUR CHILDHOODS.

22:23.576 --> 22:26.012
- THINK YOU TURNED OUT
ALL RIGHT.

22:26.045 --> 22:28.748
- MAKES ONE OF US.

22:30.783 --> 22:31.984
- CLEAN AIR CAMP.

22:32.018 --> 22:34.587
PRETTY NICE VACATION
FOR A POOR CITY KID...

22:34.621 --> 22:37.524
- LOOKS LIKE ONE OF
THE FEMALE CAMPER'S FACES

22:37.557 --> 22:38.558
HAS BEEN ERASED.
- LOOK AT THE TOP.

22:38.591 --> 22:41.994
YOU GONNA TELL ME
THAT'S NOT ALEXANDER GAMMON?

22:42.028 --> 22:44.597
- WE JUST FOUND OUR MARKER.

22:44.631 --> 22:46.899
- ALEXANDER GAMMON
WORKED FOR US

22:46.933 --> 22:50.169
FOR ONE BLESSEDLY SHORT
SUMMER IN '96.

22:50.202 --> 22:52.572
- YOU DON'T SEEM TOO FOND
OF THE MEMORY, MISS HOLMES.

22:52.605 --> 22:55.508
- HIS RICH DADDY GOT THE CAMP
OWNER TO GIVE HIM A JOB.

22:55.542 --> 22:56.876
HE WAS A JERK.

22:56.909 --> 23:00.146
DARRYL!
DARRYL, WATCH THE KICKING!

23:00.179 --> 23:03.416
KEEP CONTROL OF YOUR FEET.

23:03.450 --> 23:06.686
- NOW, WAS HE, UH,
FRIENDLY WITH THESE GENTLEMEN?

23:06.719 --> 23:09.556
- OH.
VERY.

23:09.589 --> 23:11.724
BILL DIXON WAS A LIFEGUARD
THAT SUMMER.

23:11.758 --> 23:14.494
CLUNG TO ALEXANDER'S
COATTAILS LIKE GLUE.

23:14.527 --> 23:16.863
AND VICTOR WORKED IN
THE KITCHEN.

23:16.896 --> 23:19.532
- WHAT ABOUT A GIRL
NAMED CAMILLE WALTERS?

23:19.566 --> 23:22.435
- OH. POOR CAMILLE.
SO TALENTED.

23:22.469 --> 23:25.137
SHE CAME TO US FROM SOME
VERY ABUSIVE FOSTER HOMES.

23:25.171 --> 23:28.641
- MRS. HOLMES,
WAS THERE EVER ANY EVIDENCE

23:28.675 --> 23:31.978
THAT CAMILLE WAS...

23:32.011 --> 23:34.481
MOLESTED OR ASSAULTED
AT THIS CAMP?

23:34.514 --> 23:35.347
- GOOD LORD, NO.

23:35.381 --> 23:37.984
NOTHING LIKE THAT
EVER HAPPENS HERE.

23:38.017 --> 23:40.152
- WE HAVE REASON
TO BELIEVE THAT IT DID...

23:40.186 --> 23:41.721
INVOLVING CAMILLE
AND THESE MEN.

23:41.754 --> 23:44.557
- NOW, WE CAN APPRECIATE
THAT IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

23:44.591 --> 23:46.593
DO YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING?

23:51.097 --> 23:53.566
- ONE MORNING, AFTER
OUR FOURTH OF JULY FIREWORKS,

23:53.600 --> 23:56.803
I CAME TO THE DOCK
AND FOUND CAMILLE.

23:56.836 --> 23:59.706
SHE WAS DAZED.
OUT OF IT.

23:59.739 --> 24:01.474
WHEN I ASKED HER
WHAT WAS WRONG,

24:01.508 --> 24:02.975
SHE GAVE ME
A VERY STRANGE ANSWER.

24:03.009 --> 24:05.578
- DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT SHE SAID?
- YES.

24:05.612 --> 24:07.547
BECAUSE IT RHYMED.

24:07.580 --> 24:09.582
SHE SAID,

24:09.616 --> 24:12.952
"I'M NOBODY.
WHO ARE YOU?

24:12.985 --> 24:15.622
ARE YOU NOBODY TOO?"

24:22.829 --> 24:25.565
- YOU'RE NOT NOBODY, CAMILLE.

24:30.269 --> 24:33.205
YOU WERE 14...

24:33.239 --> 24:35.808
AND YOU SPENT A SUMMER
AT A CAMP

24:35.842 --> 24:41.113
RUN BY THE CLEAN AIR FUND.

24:41.147 --> 24:45.518
AND SOMETHING TERRIBLE
HAPPENED.

24:45.552 --> 24:48.655
NOW, WHATEVER THAT WAS,

24:48.688 --> 24:52.224
YOU'VE BEEN HOLDING IT IN
ALL THESE YEARS...

24:52.258 --> 24:54.994
AND YOU NEED TO TALK
ABOUT IT NOW.

24:55.027 --> 24:58.665
- I DON'T WANT TO.
- CAMILLE...

24:58.698 --> 25:02.168
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH
TERRIBLE PAIN...

25:02.201 --> 25:04.537
AND I'M HERE TO LISTEN.

25:17.850 --> 25:22.154
CAMILLE, I'M ASKING YOU
TO TELL ME.

25:22.188 --> 25:25.257
PLEASE TELL ME.

25:28.260 --> 25:30.997
- UH...
[sniffles]

25:31.030 --> 25:34.567
IT WAS FOURTH OF JULY,

25:34.601 --> 25:37.770
AND...THEY'D JUST SET OFF
THE FIREWORKS ACROSS THE LAKE,

25:37.804 --> 25:40.840
AND...

25:42.642 --> 25:44.577
AND I WAS WALKING BACK
TO MY BUNK,

25:44.611 --> 25:47.179
AND I SAW ALEXANDER.

25:47.213 --> 25:49.015
AND HE SAID...

25:49.048 --> 25:51.884
HE SAID THAT A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
WERE GONNA GO INTO THE WOODS

25:51.918 --> 25:54.353
AND DRINK AND PLAY GAMES.

25:54.386 --> 25:57.624
- VICTOR AND BILL
WERE THERE TOO?

25:57.657 --> 26:00.259
- YEAH. THEY WERE ALREADY
DRUNK AND...

26:00.292 --> 26:02.361
[inhales, exhales]

26:02.394 --> 26:04.363
AFTER THEY LED ME
INTO THE WOODS,

26:04.396 --> 26:07.233
I ASKED WHERE
EVERYONE ELSE WAS.

26:07.266 --> 26:11.738
AND THEY LAUGHED AND SAID
THAT IT WAS A P--

26:11.771 --> 26:14.607
THAT IT WAS A PRIVATE PARTY.

26:18.711 --> 26:22.348
[sobbing]

26:23.683 --> 26:27.687
- IT'S OKAY.

26:27.720 --> 26:31.791
- ALEXANDER AND BILL
HELD ME DOWN

26:31.824 --> 26:36.729
AND VICTOR TRIED
TO GET THEM TO STOP, BUT...

26:36.763 --> 26:42.301
ALEX--ALEXANDER
RIPPED OFF MY SHORTS...

26:42.334 --> 26:45.672
AND RAPED ME.

26:45.705 --> 26:48.407
AND...

26:48.440 --> 26:50.810
AND THEN BILL.

26:50.843 --> 26:53.846
AND I WAS BLEEDING.

26:55.381 --> 26:58.617
- HE RUINED YOU.

27:00.720 --> 27:04.423
- AND VICTOR DIDN'T WANT TO,
BUT...

27:04.456 --> 27:06.826
ALEXANDER PUSHED HIM
AND SAID

27:06.859 --> 27:10.296
HE WAS A PUNK
IF HE DIDN'T GET A LITTLE.

27:10.329 --> 27:12.264
- MAKING HIM A TRAITOR.

27:14.266 --> 27:15.968
- WHEN THEY WERE DONE...

27:16.002 --> 27:19.939
ALEXANDER TOLD ME
THAT IF I TOLD ANYONE

27:19.972 --> 27:22.809
HE'D DENY IT.

27:22.842 --> 27:24.276
AND HE SAID,

27:24.310 --> 27:29.348
"WHO'D BELIEVE THE WORD
OF A LITTLE NOBODY ANYWAY?"

27:36.122 --> 27:39.258
YEAH, I BRANDED THEM...

27:39.291 --> 27:41.694
SO THEY'D NEVER FORGET
WHAT THEY DID TO ME.

27:41.728 --> 27:45.865
AND I WISH...I WISH
THAT I'D BRANDED ALEXANDER.

27:45.898 --> 27:47.399
I WOULD HAVE BURNT "HELL"
ON HIS CHEST,

27:47.433 --> 27:50.069
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE
I WAS GONNA SEND HIM.

27:56.943 --> 27:58.845
- CAMILLE...

27:58.878 --> 28:03.816
WHY WOULD YOU WAIT 14 YEARS
AFTER YOU WERE RAPED?

28:14.426 --> 28:16.763
- A FEW WEEKS AGO,
I WAS WALKING

28:16.796 --> 28:20.032
DOWN CENTRAL PARK SOUTH.

28:24.303 --> 28:27.206
AND I H--
I HEARD THIS LAUGH.

28:29.876 --> 28:32.378
AND IT SOUNDED EXACTLY

28:32.411 --> 28:35.014
LIKE THE WAY
THAT I USED TO LAUGH.

28:35.047 --> 28:38.885
AND I KNEW...
I KNEW THAT IT WAS HER.

28:38.918 --> 28:41.754
I COULD FEEL IT!

28:41.788 --> 28:43.756
- WHO, CAMILLE?

28:43.790 --> 28:46.458
- MY DAUGHTER.

28:50.496 --> 28:53.199
- THE RAPE GOT YOU PREGNANT.

28:57.970 --> 29:00.006
- AND I COULDN'T BEAR
TO KEEP HER

29:00.039 --> 29:03.342
KNOWING THAT ONE OF THEM
WAS THE FATHER.

29:06.445 --> 29:10.149
AND I GAVE MY BABY UP
FOR ADOPTION...

29:10.182 --> 29:12.952
THE DAY AFTER SHE WAS BORN.

29:29.869 --> 29:31.303
- THE HOSPITAL RECORDS
INDICATE

29:31.337 --> 29:32.972
THAT CAMILLE WALTERS
GAVE BIRTH

29:33.005 --> 29:35.207
TO A 6-POUND BABY GIRL
AT COLUMBIA PRES

29:35.241 --> 29:37.443
IN FEBRUARY OF '97.

29:37.476 --> 29:39.111
- THAT'S QUITE A STRETCH--
HEARING A LAUGH

29:39.145 --> 29:41.213
AND ASSUMING IT'S THE CHILD
YOU GAVE UP FOR ADOPTION?

29:41.247 --> 29:42.882
- A MOTHER KNOWS HER CHILD.
- WELL, WE KNOW

29:42.915 --> 29:44.583
ONE OF THESE PRICKS
IS THE FATHER.

29:44.616 --> 29:46.285
- IF CAMILLE'S
TELLING THE TRUTH.

29:46.318 --> 29:47.453
- THAT'S EASY TO PROVE.

29:47.486 --> 29:49.555
WE FIND THE GIRL,
WE TAKE HER DNA,

29:49.588 --> 29:51.858
AND WE MATCH IT
TO ONE OF THESE CREEPS.

29:51.891 --> 29:53.960
- EVEN IF WE COULD FIND HER
BY OPENING THE ADOPTION RECORDS,

29:53.993 --> 29:55.828
WHICH ARE SEALED,
IT WOULDN'T MATTER.

29:55.862 --> 29:57.463
- CAMILLE'S DAUGHTER
IS SCIENTIFIC PROOF

29:57.496 --> 29:58.998
THAT SHE WAS RAPED.

29:59.031 --> 30:00.867
- AND THE LAW SAYS
SORRY, TOO LATE.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.568
THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS
HAS EXPIRED.

30:02.601 --> 30:04.570
- OKAY, SO HOW 'BOUT IF
WE COLLAR THEM FOR OBSTRUCTION?

30:04.603 --> 30:06.472
I MEAN, THEY DID LIE
ABOUT KNOWING HER.

30:06.505 --> 30:07.974
- ANY HALF-ASSED
DEFENSE ATTORNEY

30:08.007 --> 30:09.942
WILL GET THAT TOSSED OUT.
- THEY'RE RAPISTS!

30:09.976 --> 30:11.978
- NOT THAT MY JURY
WILL HEAR.

30:12.011 --> 30:13.846
- YOU'RE GOING TO PROSECUTE
CAMILLE

30:13.880 --> 30:16.515
WHEN YOU CAN GET
IRREFUTABLE EVIDENCE

30:16.548 --> 30:17.483
THAT SHE WAS RAPED?

30:17.516 --> 30:18.885
- I HAVE NO CHOICE.

30:18.918 --> 30:21.020
YOU GAVE ME HER CONFESSION
ON TAPE.

30:21.053 --> 30:22.955
- SO CAMILLE GOES TO PRISON

30:22.989 --> 30:25.624
FOR A POSTTRAUMATIC REACTION
TO BEING GANG-RAPED,

30:25.657 --> 30:27.960
AND THOSE BASTARDS
ARE GONNA WALK AWAY FREE?

30:27.994 --> 30:29.595
- BEFORE YOU GET TOO WEEPY
FOR THE DEFENDANT,

30:29.628 --> 30:32.264
BEAR IN MIND,
SHE SODOMIZED TWO MEN

30:32.298 --> 30:34.366
AND SEARED THEIR CHEST
WITH A SCORCHING COAT HANGER.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.568
- YOU BEAR IN MIND
THAT SHE WAS RAPED.

30:36.602 --> 30:39.438
OR IS KEEPING YOUR PERCENTAGE UP
TOO IMPORTANT?

30:39.471 --> 30:41.307
- YOU DID YOUR JOB.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.442
NOW IT'S TIME TO DO MINE.

30:43.475 --> 30:45.878
NO MATTER HOW MUCH IT HURTS.

30:49.515 --> 30:51.918
- YES, I BRANDED THEM

30:51.951 --> 30:54.553
SO THEY'D NEVER FORGET
WHAT THEY DID TO ME.

30:54.586 --> 30:58.124
AND I WISH...

30:58.157 --> 31:01.493
I WISH I'D BRANDED
ALEXANDER.

31:01.527 --> 31:03.930
I WOULD HAVE BURNED "HELL"
ON HIS CHEST,

31:03.963 --> 31:06.365
'CAUSE THAT'S WHERE I WAS
GONNA SEND HIM.

31:06.398 --> 31:08.334
- DETECTIVE BENSON,
WILL YOU CORROBORATE

31:08.367 --> 31:10.136
THAT YOU OBTAINED
THIS VIDEO CONFESSION

31:10.169 --> 31:12.038
FROM THE DEFENDANT
AT THE TOMBS?

31:12.071 --> 31:13.906
- YES. BUT YOU HAVEN'T
PLAYED THE ENTIRE TAPE.

31:13.940 --> 31:15.908
- YOUR HONOR, WILL YOU
PLEASE EXPLAIN TO THE JURY--

31:15.942 --> 31:17.209
- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

31:17.243 --> 31:18.677
I'VE REDACTED PORTIONS
OF THE CONFESSION

31:18.710 --> 31:20.980
THAT I DEEMED IRRELEVANT
TO THE CASE.

31:21.013 --> 31:24.016
- WHAT CAMILLE WALTERS SAID
IS NOT IRRELEVANT.

31:24.050 --> 31:25.117
- NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

31:25.151 --> 31:28.087
- YOUR HONOR, THE JURY ISN'T
GETTING THE WHOLE STORY.

31:28.120 --> 31:30.222
- BUT YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET
A CONTEMPT CITATION.

31:30.256 --> 31:33.259
STRIKE HER LAST COMMENTS
FROM THE RECORDS.

31:35.094 --> 31:36.295
- I WAS A LIFEGUARD

31:36.328 --> 31:38.230
AT THE CLEAN AIR FUND CAMP
IN LONG BRANCH.

31:38.264 --> 31:40.099
- DO YOU RECALL
MEETING THE DEFENDANT?

31:40.132 --> 31:41.300
- VAGUELY.

31:41.333 --> 31:43.936
I THINK SHE WAS A CAMPER
THERE AROUND '96.

31:43.970 --> 31:45.371
- GIVEN THE NATURE
OF THE DEFENDANT'S CRIMES

31:45.404 --> 31:47.273
AGAINST YOU,
WOULD YOU TELL THE JURY

31:47.306 --> 31:49.641
IF THERE WAS ANY ROMANTIC
OR OTHERWISE INTIMATE CONTACT

31:49.675 --> 31:52.344
BETWEEN YOU AND MISS WALTERS,
EITHER THAT SUMMER

31:52.378 --> 31:53.212
OR ANY TIME SINCE?

31:53.245 --> 31:54.947
- OF COURSE NOT.

31:54.981 --> 31:56.983
SHE WAS...14 YEARS OLD.

31:57.016 --> 32:00.119
- CAN YOU THINK OF ANY REASON
WHY SHE ATTACKED YOU?

32:00.152 --> 32:02.288
- YES.
SHE'S INSANE.

32:02.321 --> 32:04.723
- NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

32:04.756 --> 32:06.225
- MR. DIXON,

32:06.258 --> 32:09.328
WHEN SVU DETECTIVES
INITIALLY INTERVIEWED YOU,

32:09.361 --> 32:11.197
YOU CLAIMED TO HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE
OF WHO ATTACKED YOU.

32:11.230 --> 32:13.432
- THAT'S CORRECT.
- THEN HOW CAN YOU SIT HERE

32:13.465 --> 32:16.335
SEEMINGLY ASSURED
OF MY CLIENT'S GUILT?

32:16.368 --> 32:19.571
- THE POLICE SAID SHE BRANDED
VICTOR WITH A COAT HANGER

32:19.605 --> 32:22.508
AND BROKE INTO ALEXANDER'S
APARTMENT AND...

32:22.541 --> 32:24.376
WAS GOING TO BRAND HIM.

32:24.410 --> 32:26.645
- HAVE YOU EVER MET
THE DEFENDANT BEFORE?

32:26.678 --> 32:28.647
- SHE WAS ONE OF MY CAMPERS.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.316
- WHAT WAS YOUR IMPRESSION
OF HER?

32:30.349 --> 32:32.184
- MOODY.

32:32.218 --> 32:33.385
PRONE TO LYING.

32:33.419 --> 32:34.987
SEXUALLY PROVOCATIVE.

32:35.021 --> 32:37.223
I CAUGHT HER SKINNY DIPPING
IN THE LAKE

32:37.256 --> 32:39.992
SEVERAL TIMES
WITH A NUMBER OF BOYS,

32:40.026 --> 32:41.327
AMONG OTHER THINGS.
- YOU LIAR!

32:41.360 --> 32:43.329
- CALM YOUR CLIENT DOWN,
MR. SWIFT.

32:43.362 --> 32:45.998
- YOU JUST MENTIONED
THAT YOU CAUGHT THE DEFENDANT

32:46.032 --> 32:47.133
DOING...OTHER THINGS.

32:47.166 --> 32:48.600
WHAT WERE YOU REFERRING TO?

32:48.634 --> 32:50.369
- I WAS A LIFEGUARD.

32:50.402 --> 32:55.007
SHE'D LOOSEN HER BIKINI TOP
SO IT'D SLIP OFF IN THE LAKE

32:55.041 --> 32:56.308
AND I'D SEE HER BREASTS.

32:56.342 --> 32:58.510
- YOU'RE SAYING
SHE CAME ON TO YOU.

32:58.544 --> 33:00.712
- OBJECTION.
- OVERRULED.

33:00.746 --> 33:03.549
- IT WAS
A SCHOOLGIRL CRUSH.

33:03.582 --> 33:05.484
I LET HER DOWN GENTLY.

33:05.517 --> 33:08.020
- SO SHE BROKE INTO YOUR
APARTMENT 14 YEARS LATER

33:08.054 --> 33:11.023
BECAUSE...
YOU TURNED HER DOWN?

33:11.057 --> 33:12.624
- LOOK, I'M NOT A SHRINK,

33:12.658 --> 33:14.260
BUT APPARENTLY HER FATHER
WAS A WHACK JOB

33:14.293 --> 33:15.694
THAT HAD TO BE LOCKED UP
IN BELLEVUE.

33:15.727 --> 33:17.396
- YOU SON OF A BITCH!

33:17.429 --> 33:18.364
- CALM DOWN.
- BUT HE RAPED ME!

33:18.397 --> 33:19.565
THEY ALL RAPED ME!

33:19.598 --> 33:20.732
[pounds gavel]
- ORDER.

33:20.766 --> 33:23.802
THE JURY WILL DISREGARD
MISS WALTERS.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.237
WE'LL TAKE A 15-MINUTE
RECESS

33:25.271 --> 33:28.240
SO THE DEFENDANT
CAN GET A GRIP ON HERSELF.

33:34.580 --> 33:37.049
- YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD
THE WILD ACCUSATIONS

33:37.083 --> 33:40.086
SHE MADE AGAINST YOU
IN THERE.

33:40.119 --> 33:42.188
THAT ALL OF YOU RAPED HER.

33:44.456 --> 33:46.425
- GIRL'S NUTS.

33:50.562 --> 33:52.764
- YOU SURE?

33:52.798 --> 33:54.733
- LOOK, JUST LEAVE ME
ALONE, ALL RIGHT?

33:54.766 --> 33:56.835
- MR. RAMOS...

33:56.868 --> 33:58.637
I'M GONNA TAKE A STAB
IN THE DARK HERE

33:58.670 --> 34:01.173
AND SAY YOU'RE A DECENT GUY.

34:01.207 --> 34:02.808
NOT LIKE THOSE DOUCHE BAGS
IN THERE.

34:02.841 --> 34:04.676
- PLEASE, JUST--

34:04.710 --> 34:07.079
- WHAT CAMILLE DID TO YOU
IS TERRIBLE.

34:07.113 --> 34:10.316
THOSE ANIMALS ARE PAINTING
HER WITH A BLACK BRUSH.

34:12.618 --> 34:15.354
YOU HAVE DAUGHTERS.

34:15.387 --> 34:19.391
ONE OF THEM THE SAME AGE
AS CAMILLE WAS BACK THEN.

34:30.236 --> 34:32.604
- THE TRUTH ABOUT
THAT SUMMER...

34:36.442 --> 34:38.610
THE TRUTH IS...

34:40.579 --> 34:44.183
- I'LL REPEAT THE QUESTION,
MR. RAMOS.

34:44.216 --> 34:46.352
WHAT WAS THE EXACT NATURE
OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP

34:46.385 --> 34:49.388
WITH THE DEFENDANT
THAT SUMMER?

34:49.421 --> 34:51.823
- IT'S COMPLICATED.

34:58.564 --> 35:03.402
CAMILLE DID HAVE A CRUSH
ON ALEXANDER.

35:03.435 --> 35:05.904
SHE WANTED TO HOOK UP
WITH HIM ALL SUMMER.

35:05.937 --> 35:09.875
THAT'S WHY
SHE WENT AFTER HIM.

35:09.908 --> 35:11.910
BUT I HAVE NO IDEA
WHY SHE ATTACKED ME AND BILL.

35:11.943 --> 35:14.780
- BECAUSE I HEARD HER.
SHE WAS LAUGHING!

35:14.813 --> 35:17.416
- [pounds gavel] ORDER.
- I-I TOOK A PICTURE.

35:17.449 --> 35:18.917
- NOT ANOTHER WORD,
MISS WALTERS,

35:18.950 --> 35:23.555
OR YOU'RE GOING TO ADD
CONTEMPT TO YOUR CHARGES.

35:23.589 --> 35:25.224
- ARE YOU PROUD OF YOURSELF?

35:25.257 --> 35:27.293
YOU TRASHED HER.

35:27.326 --> 35:29.395
- MY JOB'S TO WIN THE CASE.

35:29.428 --> 35:33.565
- NO, YOUR JOB IS TO MAKE SURE
THAT JUSTICE IS DONE.

35:33.599 --> 35:35.934
CONVICTING CAMILLE
ISN'T JUSTICE.

35:35.967 --> 35:37.469
- THAT'S FOR THE JURY
TO DECIDE.

35:37.503 --> 35:39.205
- THE JURY IS GONNA
THROW THE BOOK AT HER

35:39.238 --> 35:43.475
BECAUSE YOU TURNED HER INTO
SOME CRAZY SLUT.

35:43.509 --> 35:45.811
CONGRATULATIONS.

35:47.279 --> 35:48.480
- DETECTIVE.

35:48.514 --> 35:50.182
SINCE YOU'RE STORMING OFF,

35:50.216 --> 35:53.185
WOULD YOU MIND DROPPING THIS
OFF AT DEFENSE COUNSEL?

35:54.586 --> 35:56.455
FRIEND GAVE IT TO ME.

36:00.526 --> 36:02.694
AND DON'T LOOK
AT WHAT'S INSIDE.

36:11.503 --> 36:13.539
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

36:20.579 --> 36:22.648
- CALL YOUR NEXT WITNESS.

36:22.681 --> 36:25.684
- THE DEFENSE CALLS
HANNAH MILNER TO THE STAND.

36:32.258 --> 36:34.560
- [whispers]
IT'S HER.

36:34.593 --> 36:37.229
- WHO THE HELL IS SHE?

36:37.263 --> 36:39.865
- DEFENSE WITNESS, I GUESS.

36:41.867 --> 36:44.002
- PLEASE TELL THE COURT
YOUR NAME.

36:44.035 --> 36:46.572
- HANNAH MILNER.

36:46.605 --> 36:49.575
- HANNAH, PLEASE POINT OUT
YOUR PARENTS TO THE COURT.

36:49.608 --> 36:50.609
- YES, SIR.
RIGHT THERE.

36:50.642 --> 36:52.644
- FOR THE RECORD,
PLEASE INDICATE

36:52.678 --> 36:55.547
THE WITNESS IS POINTING
TO MR. AND MRS. DAVID MILNER

36:55.581 --> 36:57.483
OF SMITHTOWN, NEW YORK.

36:57.516 --> 36:59.985
THE MILNERS ARE YOUR
ADOPTIVE PARENTS, CORRECT?

37:00.018 --> 37:02.488
- YES.
- DO YOU KNOW WHO YOUR

37:02.521 --> 37:04.556
BIOLOGICAL PARENTS ARE?
- YES.

37:04.590 --> 37:06.258
- AND HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS?

37:06.292 --> 37:08.560
- YOU FOUND ME AND TOOK
MY BLOOD FOR A DNA TEST.

37:08.594 --> 37:09.761
YESTERDAY, YOU CALLED ME BACK

37:09.795 --> 37:11.863
AND SHOWED ME PICTURES
OF MY PARENTS.

37:11.897 --> 37:14.566
- ARE YOUR BIOLOGICAL PARENTS
HERE IN THIS COURT?

37:14.600 --> 37:15.867
- YES.

37:15.901 --> 37:18.036
- WILL YOU POINT THEM OUT?

37:18.069 --> 37:20.539
- MY BIOLOGICAL MOTHER
IS SITTING RIGHT THERE.

37:20.572 --> 37:24.476
- THE DEFENDANT,
CAMILLE WALTERS.

37:24.510 --> 37:26.612
AND IS YOUR BIOLOGICAL
FATHER

37:26.645 --> 37:28.680
IN THIS COURTROOM?

37:30.849 --> 37:32.584
- YES.

37:32.618 --> 37:33.752
- WILL YOU POINT HIM OUT?

37:33.785 --> 37:35.921
- YOUR HONOR,
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO

37:35.954 --> 37:37.623
WITH THAT LUNATIC
STALKING US.

37:37.656 --> 37:39.958
- SIT DOWN, MR. GAMMON,
AND DON'T SAY ANOTHER WORD.

37:39.991 --> 37:41.593
YOU MAY PROCEED.

37:41.627 --> 37:44.496
- HANNAH, WILL YOU POINT OUT
YOUR BIOLOGICAL FATHER?

37:44.530 --> 37:46.632
- HE'S RIGHT THERE.

37:46.665 --> 37:48.600
- HANNAH, YOU'RE INDICATING
THIS GENTLEMAN

37:48.634 --> 37:50.001
IN THE BLUE SHIRT,
ALEXANDER GAMMON?

37:50.035 --> 37:51.603
- OBJECTION!

37:51.637 --> 37:53.339
- MR. GAMMON,
I'VE WARNED YOU TO BE QUIET.

37:53.372 --> 37:56.007
- BUT THIS IS INSANE!
- SIT DOWN NOW!

37:59.411 --> 38:01.647
- HANNAH, I REPEAT,
YOU'RE INDICATING

38:01.680 --> 38:04.583
ALEXANDER GAMMON?
- NO. THE MAN BEHIND HIM.

38:13.825 --> 38:16.628
- IT'S TRUE.

38:16.662 --> 38:18.330
SHE IS MY DAUGHTER.

38:18.364 --> 38:19.931
- SHUT UP, RAMOS.
- AND WE RAPED HER.

38:19.965 --> 38:21.633
I'M SO SORRY, CAMILLE.

38:21.667 --> 38:23.669
ALL THREE OF US DID IT.

38:23.702 --> 38:25.537
THE THREE OF US, WE RAPED HER.
- I DIDN'T RAPE ANYONE.

38:25.571 --> 38:26.772
- OFFICERS,
ESCORT MR. RAMOS OUT.

38:26.805 --> 38:27.806
- SHE'S NOT LYING!

38:27.839 --> 38:29.608
HE'S BEEN PAYING US OFF
FOR YEARS!

38:29.641 --> 38:30.809
- OH, HE'S CRAZY.
- YOU MADE US DO THIS!

38:30.842 --> 38:32.344
YOU MADE US DO THIS.

38:32.378 --> 38:34.380
HE TALKED US INTO IT.
I'M ASHAMED!

38:34.413 --> 38:35.847
I'M ASHAMED OF WHAT I DID.

38:35.881 --> 38:38.550
THERE'S OTHER WOMEN!
HE'S RAPED OTHER WOMEN.

38:38.584 --> 38:39.751
HE PAYS THEM OFF
TO KEEP THEM QUIET.

38:39.785 --> 38:41.052
I KNOW THIS.
I DO HIS BOOKS!

38:41.086 --> 38:43.088
- OH, HE'S CRAZY!
- YOU'RE A RAPIST!

38:43.121 --> 38:45.891
YOU'RE A RAPIST!

38:55.100 --> 38:58.404
- WELL, WELL, WELL.

38:58.437 --> 39:00.572
SO YOUR OLD BUDDIES
DIXON AND RAMOS

39:00.606 --> 39:03.642
ARE GONNA DO SOME TIME
FOR PERJURY.

39:03.675 --> 39:06.512
SMALL PRICE TO PAY
FOR RAPE, HUH?

39:06.545 --> 39:08.447
WELL...

39:08.480 --> 39:09.515
AT LEAST IT'S SOMETHING.

39:09.548 --> 39:11.650
BUT YOU, MY FRIEND...

39:11.683 --> 39:15.621
YOU ARE LOOKING AT
A VERY LONG BID.

39:18.724 --> 39:20.392
- HOW'D YOU KNOW
RAMOS WAS THE FATHER?

39:20.426 --> 39:21.560
- THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

39:21.593 --> 39:24.896
WE MATCHED THE DNA AGAINST
A COFFEE CUP YOU TOSSED OUT

39:24.930 --> 39:26.732
AND THE BLOOD WORK THAT RAMOS
AND DIXON HAD DONE

39:26.765 --> 39:27.933
AT THE HOSPITAL.

39:27.966 --> 39:29.601
HUH?

39:29.635 --> 39:30.936
HEY.

39:32.571 --> 39:35.106
DO YOU RECOGNIZE THEM?

39:38.677 --> 39:40.679
HMM?

39:44.049 --> 39:46.552
THEY WERE ON YOUR PAYROLL.
YOUR MONEY FOR THEIR SILENCE.

39:46.585 --> 39:50.889
EXCEPT...THEY'RE GIVING
THE MONEY BACK

39:50.922 --> 39:53.659
AND PRESSING CHARGES
AGAINST YOU.

39:53.692 --> 39:56.061
AND YOU KNOW, UNLIKE CAMILLE,
THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

39:56.094 --> 39:57.929
HASN'T RUN OUT ON THEM.

40:07.105 --> 40:10.008
- WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

40:10.041 --> 40:13.612
- GO DIRECTLY TO JAIL.

40:13.645 --> 40:15.581
DO NOT PASS GO.

40:15.614 --> 40:18.784
DO NOT COLLECT $200.

40:22.053 --> 40:25.190
- THANK YOU,
DETECTIVE BENSON.

40:25.223 --> 40:28.193
- YOU'LL STILL NEED TO SEE
JUDGE ANDREWS ABOUT SENTENCING.

40:28.226 --> 40:30.629
BUT ON TWO MINOR COUNTS
OF TRESPASS,

40:30.662 --> 40:32.230
I THINK YOU'LL DO OKAY.

40:32.263 --> 40:35.601
- WELL, WHATEVER SENTENCE
THE JUDGE GIVES...

40:35.634 --> 40:36.902
I DESERVE IT.

40:36.935 --> 40:38.003
- COME ON.

40:38.036 --> 40:40.772
SOMEBODY WANTS TO SAY
HI TO YOU.

40:44.943 --> 40:47.779
- HANNAH.

40:47.813 --> 40:50.582
- I JUST WANTED TO SAY
GOOD LUCK IN COURT.

40:50.616 --> 40:52.217
- [laughs]

40:52.250 --> 40:55.821
I'M SORRY THIS IS THE WAY
WE HAD TO MEET.

40:59.024 --> 41:00.526
- I'M NOT.

41:00.559 --> 41:03.194
- [laughs]

41:03.228 --> 41:04.630
THANK YOU.
