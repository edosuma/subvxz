00:58.400 --> 00:59.674
Is something wrong?

01:03.520 --> 01:05.750
Lex, what's happening?

01:08.120 --> 01:09.633
Lex, where are you going?

01:22.400 --> 01:23.958
Come on, Lex. Pick up.

01:43.200 --> 01:44.713
Lex!

02:15.920 --> 02:18.115
- Lex!
- Stay there.

02:21.080 --> 02:23.833
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

03:19.480 --> 03:20.913
Stay away from her!

03:21.600 --> 03:24.558
- What are you doing?
- I'm preparing him.

03:30.120 --> 03:31.269
No!

04:50.160 --> 04:53.391
People have been buying airline tickets
long before computers.

04:53.560 --> 04:58.395
So glitch or no glitch, there has to be
some record of us being on this flight.

04:58.560 --> 05:01.120
Can I talk to your supervisor?

05:02.800 --> 05:06.349
Actually, let me talk
to your supervisor's supervisor.

05:11.800 --> 05:13.074
Lionel.

05:13.240 --> 05:15.629
I thought you'd be on your way
to Washington by now.

05:15.800 --> 05:17.153
Come in.

05:19.120 --> 05:21.680
No. Unfortunately...

05:21.840 --> 05:25.276
...thanks to the airline company's
cutting-edge computer system...

05:25.440 --> 05:26.839
...the flight was canceled.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.675
That's easily solved. The Luthorcorp jet
is free to take you this afternoon.

05:30.840 --> 05:34.150
No, no. I can't continue
taking favors from you.

05:34.320 --> 05:37.437
Don't make this personal, Martha.
It's business.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.556
It's the way to cope
with an emergency.

05:39.720 --> 05:42.712
The important thing
is that you get there for the meeting.

05:42.880 --> 05:45.235
It's a national education summit.

05:45.400 --> 05:49.188
There will be over 3000 people there.

05:49.360 --> 05:51.396
I'll be wearing my inexperience
like a badge.

05:51.560 --> 05:56.998
Well, experience is often overrated,
especially in Washington. You...

05:57.320 --> 06:00.392
You've got integrity, Martha.

06:01.200 --> 06:05.398
It's one of the rare <i>qualities...</i>

06:05.880 --> 06:07.791
...you possess.

06:21.200 --> 06:24.272
Hey. I was beginning to think
I was living with a ghost.

06:24.440 --> 06:26.476
Not that it would be the first time.

06:30.400 --> 06:33.437
- Lana, are you all right?
- I'm so scared, chloe.

06:34.120 --> 06:36.918
- I knew he was getting in too deep.
- Who?

06:37.320 --> 06:40.357
Lex. They took him.

06:42.600 --> 06:44.909
Tell me what happened.

06:48.800 --> 06:51.473
We were in a field...

06:51.640 --> 06:54.154
...and there was this flash of light
and Lex was taken.

06:55.120 --> 06:56.712
Taken where?

06:56.880 --> 07:01.670
Into the black ship I saw
in the meteor shower. It's back.

07:02.360 --> 07:05.193
Do you think Fine had something
to do with this?

07:05.800 --> 07:08.075
Fine was there.

07:09.160 --> 07:11.628
He said that he was preparing him.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.592
I can't believe I let this happen.

07:15.760 --> 07:17.273
Lana, you can't blame yourself.

07:17.440 --> 07:19.795
It's my fault he was involved
in the first place.

07:22.520 --> 07:24.590
Chloe...

07:25.200 --> 07:27.509
<i>...what</i> if he's dead?

07:35.320 --> 07:36.958
What, do you mean "taken"?

07:37.120 --> 07:40.351
I mean, ripped from the earth
and sucked into the sky.

07:40.520 --> 07:42.909
His abductor did leave
a calling card in the field.

07:43.080 --> 07:45.833
From Lana's description,
it sounded a lot like Zod's symbol.

07:47.240 --> 07:49.595
Lionel's drawings
warned of Zod coming.

07:51.200 --> 07:53.430
Maybe it's actually happening.

07:53.600 --> 07:55.556
What is happening? I don't get it.

07:55.720 --> 07:59.838
I thought that Zod was trapped in that
Phantom-prism other-dimension thing.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.911
That's what I'm worried about.

08:02.080 --> 08:04.514
Fine knows I would not
release Zod willingly.

08:04.680 --> 08:06.875
He's obviously changed strategies.

08:07.040 --> 08:10.749
- So then Lex is part of plan B?
- Which means Lana's in the middle.

08:10.920 --> 08:14.799
I know what you're thinking. She used
to come to you. That's different now.

08:14.960 --> 08:17.315
And you know what?
That was your choice.

08:17.880 --> 08:20.474
I don't feel like I've made any
of the right choices.

08:20.640 --> 08:23.552
I've been so angry with Jor-EI,
I didn't listen to his warnings.

08:23.720 --> 08:26.712
It seems every time you turn to Jor-El
something bad happens.

08:26.880 --> 08:28.677
What if he's just trying to protect me?

08:31.320 --> 08:34.153
What if he's trying
to protect all of us?

08:49.840 --> 08:52.070
<i>Hello, my son.</i>

08:52.240 --> 08:54.595
I had no other choice
but to come here.

08:54.760 --> 08:58.958
<i>I know you are still angered</i>
<i>by the loss of Jonathan Kent.</i>

09:00.880 --> 09:03.917
- He was my father.
- <i>I am your father.</i>

09:04.080 --> 09:05.991
<i>Pain is part of life, Kal-EI.</i>

09:06.160 --> 09:08.628
<i>But you cannot let it blind you.</i>

09:08.800 --> 09:11.234
Fine has returned...

09:11.400 --> 09:13.755
...to release Zod.
What am I supposed to do?

09:13.920 --> 09:19.153
<i>Fine is merely an extension of the craft</i>
<i>that can regenerate in any form.</i>

09:19.320 --> 09:22.392
If Fine is part of the ship,
then who is controlling it?

09:22.560 --> 09:24.869
<i>It's not just a ship.</i>

09:25.040 --> 09:28.157
<i>It's the Brain InterActive Construct.</i>

09:28.320 --> 09:31.551
<i>An advanced technology that will</i>
<i>stop at nothing until its master...</i>

09:31.720 --> 09:34.473
<i>... Zod, has been released.</i>

09:34.640 --> 09:36.551
No, there's gotta be
some way to stop him.

09:36.720 --> 09:38.631
<i>There is one way.</i>

09:38.800 --> 09:40.836
<i>Zod was imprisoned</i>
<i>in the Phantom Zone...</i>

09:41.000 --> 09:45.630
<i>... for crimes that led to the</i>
<i>destruction of our planet.</i>

09:46.880 --> 09:48.199
Zod killed you.

09:48.360 --> 09:50.510
<i>And your mother.</i>

09:50.680 --> 09:53.194
<i>And our entire race.</i>

09:53.360 --> 09:56.238
<i>Just as he will do on Earth.</i>

09:57.400 --> 09:58.913
I won't let that happen.

09:59.080 --> 10:00.718
<i>Zod's physical body was destroyed...</i>

10:00.880 --> 10:04.475
<i>... to prevent him from escaping</i>
<i>the Phantom Zone.</i>

10:04.640 --> 10:10.112
<i>He can be freed if he finds a body,</i>
<i>a vessel to inhabit.</i>

10:19.760 --> 10:23.230
<i>You must find the human vessel</i>
<i>and destroy it.</i>

10:23.400 --> 10:27.234
<i>No matter who it may be.</i>

10:35.480 --> 10:37.675
I've heard of fathers demanding
a lot of sons...

10:37.840 --> 10:39.432
...but asking you to commit murder?

10:39.600 --> 10:43.309
- That goes way beyond domineering dad.
- Chloe, I'm not killing anyone.

10:43.480 --> 10:48.156
Well, I hate to say this, but disobeying
Jor-El has had grim consequences.

10:48.760 --> 10:51.194
There's gotta be another way.

10:51.800 --> 10:54.598
Okay, well, what about...?
What about the vessel?

10:54.760 --> 10:57.718
I mean, why doesn't this Zod guy
come fully composed?

10:57.880 --> 11:00.792
All Jor-El told me was that Zod's spirit
would possess a human.

11:00.960 --> 11:04.555
This is the Zod whose hobbies include
mass destruction and world domination?

11:06.000 --> 11:09.549
Chloe, what if Lex is the vessel?

11:10.440 --> 11:13.318
That's why the ship took him.

11:13.480 --> 11:16.790
Lana said that Fine was preparing him.

11:21.160 --> 11:23.310
If I'm <i>right...</i>

11:23.560 --> 11:25.994
...then I gotta kill Lex.

11:48.720 --> 11:49.994
You know, Clark...

11:50.160 --> 11:53.470
...in certain cultures, when a father
presents his son with a knife...

11:53.640 --> 11:57.315
...it represents a rite of passage.

11:59.440 --> 12:01.078
How do you know this is from Jor-EI?

12:01.240 --> 12:04.755
The glyphs on the blade,
they're Kryptonian.

12:04.920 --> 12:07.354
What does Jor-El want you
to do with the dagger?

12:09.960 --> 12:11.234
Clark...

12:11.400 --> 12:13.391
...I came here to find you.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.709
When I woke up this morning,
I found this.

12:16.880 --> 12:19.189
Must have written it in my sleep.

12:23.160 --> 12:25.071
It's another warning from Jor-EI?

12:26.480 --> 12:28.835
Tell me what it says.

12:30.680 --> 12:32.352
"Sacrifice the vessel."

12:32.520 --> 12:34.351
The vessel? I don't understand.

12:38.880 --> 12:41.189
Let me help you.

12:41.360 --> 12:43.920
Clark, please.

12:44.080 --> 12:47.072
You don't have to
make this decision alone.

12:47.240 --> 12:50.152
There's nothing you
or anybody else can do.

12:50.320 --> 12:53.278
Don't underestimate me, son.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.508
Jor-El wants me to kill...

13:02.640 --> 13:04.756
...the person who will be the vessel.

13:05.760 --> 13:07.990
Zod will possess a human form.

13:08.160 --> 13:11.311
Destroy Earth just as he did Krypton.

13:13.240 --> 13:14.992
But I can't kill anyone.

13:15.160 --> 13:17.799
You of all people should know that.

13:20.880 --> 13:22.916
Clark...

13:25.800 --> 13:28.792
...the real test of a hero...

13:28.960 --> 13:33.715
...is knowing when the greater good
will be served by an evil act.

13:33.880 --> 13:35.632
To save the Earth...

13:35.800 --> 13:39.110
...the cost of one life
is the price that must be paid.

13:42.040 --> 13:43.917
Even if that life is your son?

13:50.440 --> 13:52.351
Lex is the vessel of Zod.

13:59.520 --> 14:01.238
He was abducted this morning.

14:02.520 --> 14:04.158
Out of Maier's field.

14:09.240 --> 14:11.754
Maier's field, you say?

14:30.560 --> 14:31.834
Lex?

14:32.680 --> 14:33.954
Lex?

14:34.120 --> 14:35.394
Son.

14:35.560 --> 14:38.438
- Are you all right?
- Everything feels different.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.389
Clark told me they'd taken you.
What happened, son?

14:45.160 --> 14:46.434
Are you hurt?

14:50.280 --> 14:53.192
You tried to warn me about Fine,
but I didn't listen.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.271
You never have.

14:55.440 --> 14:56.714
No matter what I give you...

14:56.880 --> 15:00.236
<i>...the</i> things you've always wanted
were beyond your grasp.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.550
This time you've overreached yourself.

15:02.720 --> 15:04.995
Did you come out here
to lecture me or to help me?

15:05.160 --> 15:07.116
It's too late to do either, isn't it?

15:07.280 --> 15:10.158
You made a deal with the devil.

15:11.080 --> 15:13.150
He always comes to collect.

15:16.160 --> 15:17.912
Lex.

15:39.680 --> 15:40.669
Dad, are you okay?

15:41.200 --> 15:45.751
What have they done to you, Lex?

15:47.200 --> 15:49.794
What have they turned you into?

16:08.200 --> 16:10.111
Lex.

16:12.920 --> 16:15.070
I thought I'd never see you again.

16:15.240 --> 16:16.514
It's okay.

16:18.520 --> 16:19.794
What happened?

16:21.720 --> 16:23.551
I've been given a gift.

17:25.599 --> 17:29.991
Your hand.
There's not a scratch on it.

17:30.160 --> 17:33.311
You need to know the truth about me.

17:42.640 --> 17:45.473
They've turned you into one of them.

17:47.120 --> 17:49.270
I have their abilities...

17:49.440 --> 17:51.237
<i>...but</i> it's still me.

17:52.840 --> 17:54.398
Lana...

17:54.560 --> 17:57.120
<i>...I'd</i> never lie to you.

18:10.680 --> 18:13.558
How could I keep
something like this...

18:14.040 --> 18:16.679
...from the person I care about most?

18:30.320 --> 18:32.072
Lex.

18:32.880 --> 18:36.031
I overheard Clark and Chloe talking.

18:37.160 --> 18:39.469
Now that you're <i>back...</i>

18:39.640 --> 18:41.517
...Clark...

18:43.800 --> 18:46.598
<i>...he's</i> going to try and kill you.

18:54.840 --> 18:56.512
It's fear, Lana.

19:00.720 --> 19:03.792
My father's infected him with it.

19:05.680 --> 19:07.989
Like he used to do to me.

19:09.360 --> 19:12.318
Clark can't stand the fact
that I'm different now.

19:14.120 --> 19:16.588
- There's someplace I need to go.
- Take me with you.

19:16.760 --> 19:18.318
No.

19:23.960 --> 19:25.916
Hey.

19:26.080 --> 19:28.878
Know that I'll always love you.

19:29.960 --> 19:32.997
You're talking like
we'll never see each other again.

19:34.760 --> 19:36.273
That's your choice.

19:36.440 --> 19:38.317
If you want us to be together...

19:39.160 --> 19:42.311
...meet me on the roof
of LuthorCorp Plaza.

19:42.480 --> 19:44.357
I'll be there tonight.

20:04.560 --> 20:06.596
You found Lex.

20:06.760 --> 20:09.832
Yeah. He was...

20:10.760 --> 20:13.911
<i>...in</i> the field. He's... He's not...

20:16.200 --> 20:17.599
He's changed.

20:21.200 --> 20:22.519
What happened to you?

20:25.240 --> 20:28.073
Everything Fine has been doing is...

20:28.240 --> 20:31.232
It was meant to prepare Lex.

20:31.400 --> 20:36.428
Somehow he now possesses
the same powers as you, Clark.

20:37.960 --> 20:40.520
You can't begin to imagine
what he's gonna do with them.

20:41.520 --> 20:42.794
Why do you say that?

20:47.880 --> 20:50.997
He wasn't raised like you, clark.

20:51.800 --> 20:56.430
I taught him to survive at any cost,
to be completely ruthless.

20:56.600 --> 21:00.513
Maybe that's what'll save him. There's
still a part of Lex that can fight this.

21:00.680 --> 21:02.477
You see that in him
because you want to.

21:02.640 --> 21:05.393
There's always been a dark force
at work inside him.

21:05.560 --> 21:07.835
I don't wanna hurt Lex.

21:09.960 --> 21:13.157
If Zod is as evil
as you believe him to be...

21:13.320 --> 21:18.314
<i>...it's</i> easy to understand why
he chose Lex to inhabit as his vessel.

21:20.320 --> 21:21.719
What about Lana?

21:22.320 --> 21:24.151
Someone very close to you.

21:24.320 --> 21:26.788
She's a big part of his life right now.

21:30.600 --> 21:33.876
Be careful what you
decide to do, Clark.

21:36.560 --> 21:39.677
Which one are you willing to sacrifice?

21:47.320 --> 21:50.835
If you'll be 20,000 feet above the
ground, might as well do it in luxury.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.797
Well, enjoy it while you can.

21:52.960 --> 21:57.033
If our flight hadn't been canceled,
I'd never feel comfortable doing this.

21:57.680 --> 22:00.638
Well, you might wanna start
finding your comfort zone.

22:00.800 --> 22:04.475
This isn't gonna be the last time
you're invited to fly the Luthor skies.

22:06.240 --> 22:08.276
This is just a friendly gesture.

22:10.480 --> 22:12.311
Right.

22:13.360 --> 22:16.272
Look, another friendly gesture.

22:18.800 --> 22:20.836
Card's for you.

22:27.200 --> 22:30.192
Lionel can be a very generous man.

22:34.720 --> 22:38.679
I'm not interested in a relationship
with Lionel or anyone.

22:39.840 --> 22:41.831
- Really?
- Yes.

22:43.240 --> 22:45.800
Or are you just worried
about how Clark would take it?

22:47.880 --> 22:50.474
Okay. Enough said.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.036
Lex!

22:58.200 --> 23:00.191
Lex!

23:03.040 --> 23:05.838
- You'll never find him.
- Lana, he's in trouble.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.560
I suppose you're gonna tell me
you came here to help.

23:08.720 --> 23:11.678
- I don't want anything to happen to him.
- Like what?

23:11.840 --> 23:13.796
Having your best friend
turn against you?

23:14.320 --> 23:18.233
I heard you and Chloe
talking about killing Lex.

23:18.400 --> 23:21.198
I don't know how you knew
he was gonna come back different...

23:21.360 --> 23:23.157
...but I guess
I shouldn't be surprised.

23:23.320 --> 23:26.232
Lana, you can't stay with him.
He's not what you think.

23:26.800 --> 23:30.713
He told me his secret and it doesn't
change the way that I feel about him.

23:31.840 --> 23:33.717
What's happened,
it doesn't scare you?

23:33.880 --> 23:36.553
I am not going to abandon Lex.

23:36.720 --> 23:38.676
Neither am I.

23:40.120 --> 23:44.511
Listen, Fine would not give him powers
without expecting something in return.

23:45.360 --> 23:46.759
It's not over, Lana.

23:46.920 --> 23:49.150
I can help him
if you tell me where he is.

23:49.840 --> 23:51.512
How do I know you won't hurt him?

23:53.600 --> 23:57.149
- You know me.
- No, I don't.

23:57.640 --> 24:01.952
You have all these different sides to you.
I can't tell if any of them is the real you.

24:06.120 --> 24:10.557
If you have ever
really cared about me...

24:11.280 --> 24:13.748
<i>...tell</i> me what's happening to Lex.

24:18.520 --> 24:21.034
- Lana, please.
- You don't trust me.

24:23.080 --> 24:25.514
You've never trusted me, have you?

24:30.520 --> 24:33.398
I don't know how
I could have ever loved you.

24:45.120 --> 24:49.159
And to think her loyalty
could have been yours...

24:49.320 --> 24:51.356
<i>...if</i> you'd been honest with her.

24:51.520 --> 24:54.478
I'm sure Zod
will cherish her allegiance.

24:57.320 --> 24:58.719
Leave Lana out of this.

25:00.760 --> 25:03.320
It's your own fault, Kal-EI.

25:04.560 --> 25:06.312
You were supposed to be the vessel...

25:06.520 --> 25:09.830
<i>...but</i> your father's spirit
was too strong in you.

25:10.560 --> 25:12.994
If you'd have released Zod
the first time...

25:13.160 --> 25:15.310
...they would have been spared.

25:15.760 --> 25:18.513
I'm giving you one more chance.

25:18.720 --> 25:21.393
Nothing could make me
release a monster like Zod.

25:21.560 --> 25:25.712
Except maybe your one weakness:

25:26.000 --> 25:27.274
Humans.

25:28.040 --> 25:31.953
They're so fragile. They'll never survive
without their technology.

25:32.160 --> 25:33.991
No matter how crude.

25:34.160 --> 25:39.109
Take that away, and they'll devolve
back to the animals they really are.

25:39.920 --> 25:41.592
And you can't save all of them.

25:44.320 --> 25:46.151
I'll never do what you want.

25:47.640 --> 25:49.551
Then it begins.

25:56.120 --> 25:57.838
Enjoy the show.

26:15.320 --> 26:18.153
Chloe! Chloe?

26:18.320 --> 26:21.471
- What's going on? Streetlights are out.
- You tell me.

26:24.120 --> 26:25.678
It's already reached Metropolis.

26:26.520 --> 26:28.954
- You know where it started?
- Smallville.

26:29.120 --> 26:31.350
Fine did something
to one of Lex's computers.

26:31.520 --> 26:34.353
Thought if anyone could figure out
what it was, it'd be you.

26:34.520 --> 26:37.910
It's an electronic virus and it's
spreading faster than I can track it.

26:38.080 --> 26:41.390
After it scaled every firewall and
knocked down all the communication...

26:41.560 --> 26:43.391
<i>...it's</i> infecting the infrastructure.

26:43.600 --> 26:44.919
All because of me.

26:45.080 --> 26:48.629
I refused to release Zod.
Now Fine's trying to force my hand.

26:48.800 --> 26:51.473
Well, he's definitely playing hardball.

26:51.640 --> 26:56.191
Elevators, gas mains, subways,
the entire city is shutting down.

26:56.360 --> 26:58.476
I mean, it's like Y2K on acid.

26:58.920 --> 27:01.832
<i>The complete and sudden collapse</i>
<i>of the city's infrastructure...</i>

27:02.000 --> 27:04.798
<i>... has caused havoc and panic</i>
<i>throughout Metropolis.</i>

27:04.960 --> 27:09.238
<i>Reports of scattered looting</i>
<i>and violence are beginning to surface...</i>

27:09.560 --> 27:12.950
Clark, if this continues...

27:13.120 --> 27:16.635
...every major city in the world
is gonna be infiltrated.

27:30.560 --> 27:32.198
Clark, there's no use.

27:32.760 --> 27:34.318
You can't save everyone.

27:34.520 --> 27:35.873
And I can't release Zod.

27:36.040 --> 27:37.519
Well, what if Jor-El was right?

27:37.680 --> 27:40.558
I mean, what if the only way
to stop Zod and stop Fine...

27:40.720 --> 27:44.395
...and stop all of this
is to just destroy that vessel?

27:47.480 --> 27:49.232
I don't wanna leave you here.

27:49.440 --> 27:51.078
You have to.

27:56.640 --> 27:58.312
Clark.

27:59.920 --> 28:02.388
I don't know
if I'm ever gonna see you again.

28:29.640 --> 28:33.428
<i>Hello, Clark.</i>
<i>I heard you wanna see me.</i>

28:45.800 --> 28:48.872
You'd tell me if I had drool
all over my face, wouldn't you?

28:51.120 --> 28:55.955
- What time is it?
- It's about 10 minutes to 9.

28:58.200 --> 28:59.872
And we aren't there yet?

29:00.040 --> 29:02.429
We should be strolling down
Pennsylvania Avenue now.

29:02.600 --> 29:04.989
You're right. I lost track of the time.

29:05.160 --> 29:07.116
We must have hit
some strong headwinds.

29:07.280 --> 29:09.714
More like gale-force.
We should've landed an hour ago.

29:09.880 --> 29:13.509
Lois, relax. There are a million reasons
why we could've been delayed.

29:13.680 --> 29:15.238
I'm sure everything's okay.

29:19.840 --> 29:23.594
I might have flunked geography
but the last time I checked...

29:23.920 --> 29:27.037
...the East Coast,
it didn't look like this.

29:55.080 --> 29:56.877
So, what did you decide, Clark?

29:59.520 --> 30:00.839
Are you gonna kill me?

30:01.720 --> 30:04.280
You can't blame me for this, Lex.

30:05.120 --> 30:06.394
You did this to yourself.

30:06.600 --> 30:08.636
Oh, come on, Clark.

30:09.080 --> 30:10.877
You love it!

30:11.520 --> 30:12.953
Since that day on the bridge...

30:13.120 --> 30:15.918
...you've always seen yourself
as my savior.

30:16.400 --> 30:20.598
The one thing that would pull me
off the dark path I'd started.

30:20.760 --> 30:24.548
See, that's why you cling to the idea
that there's still some good in me.

30:24.720 --> 30:27.837
You don't wanna face the fact
that you might have failed.

30:28.040 --> 30:31.112
Or maybe I can't believe someone
would have so little willpower.

30:31.320 --> 30:33.754
It's hard to compete
with the willpower it takes...

30:33.920 --> 30:36.434
...to kill one of your best friends.

30:39.400 --> 30:42.119
How did you know
I was gonna come back like this?

30:43.320 --> 30:45.550
You don't realize
how much danger you're in.

30:49.520 --> 30:55.152
I used to think you had
this strong inner core.

30:56.320 --> 30:58.880
You were so virtuous.

31:00.320 --> 31:02.515
And yet you lie...

31:03.320 --> 31:04.594
...all the time.

31:04.800 --> 31:09.954
To me, to Lana,
to all the people who cared about you.

31:10.880 --> 31:13.314
What kind of sick person
would do that?

31:15.320 --> 31:17.436
If you thought this friendship
was so doomed...

31:17.600 --> 31:21.479
...then why did you fight to keep it?
- Because I wanted everything you had.

31:21.640 --> 31:26.350
The family, the inconspicuous life,
the loyal girlfriend.

31:28.520 --> 31:32.274
Well, at least I walked away
with the part you loved the most.

31:36.920 --> 31:38.956
You're not yourself.

31:39.640 --> 31:42.234
Or maybe I finally am.

31:56.320 --> 31:59.437
I knew there was something
different about you.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.150
Do it, Clark.

32:16.920 --> 32:19.195
Let's see if you're really
your father's son.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.399
What have I done?

32:44.480 --> 32:46.675
You've opened the portal for Zod.

33:12.480 --> 33:13.515
Lex?

33:15.960 --> 33:17.439
Lex?

33:34.600 --> 33:36.636
You have your father's eyes.

33:39.480 --> 33:41.152
Hello, Kal-EI.

33:47.200 --> 33:49.919
- Where's Lex?
- Lex is dead.

33:54.040 --> 33:55.314
Why are you here?

33:55.520 --> 33:59.479
For the same reason as anyone
who'd been imprisoned like a beast.

34:00.680 --> 34:01.829
Revenge.

34:06.320 --> 34:10.233
Your father banished me
to an eternal hell...

34:10.639 --> 34:13.632
...trying to save a doomed race.

34:14.320 --> 34:18.393
And in the end, the only survivor
of his pathetic crusade...

34:19.800 --> 34:21.755
...was his son.

34:25.960 --> 34:28.155
Then this is between us.

34:29.719 --> 34:32.518
- These people did nothing to harm you.
- No.

34:33.199 --> 34:38.274
But you feel no pain greater
than to see others in agony.

34:40.000 --> 34:43.072
I won't let you destroy this planet
like you did Krypton.

34:45.120 --> 34:46.678
You don't have a <i>choice...</i>

34:49.760 --> 34:51.159
...unless you join me.

34:52.960 --> 34:55.632
I'll never join you.

35:00.000 --> 35:04.835
Well, I hope that's a decision
you'll be able to live with forever.

35:40.200 --> 35:42.270
Open the door!

35:50.920 --> 35:54.151
Lois, I'm not feeling well.

35:54.320 --> 35:56.151
- Neither am I.
- I can't breathe.

35:56.320 --> 35:58.470
Wait a minute, Mrs. Kent.

35:59.520 --> 36:02.080
The air pressure. We need oxygen.

36:02.240 --> 36:04.754
Open the door!

36:06.520 --> 36:08.431
Mrs. Kent.

36:10.600 --> 36:13.512
Mrs. Kent. Wake up!

36:14.320 --> 36:16.151
You have to stay awake.

37:29.720 --> 37:31.597
Where do you think
you're going, huh?

37:49.920 --> 37:51.672
No!

38:09.200 --> 38:11.395
Help! Please let me in!

38:11.560 --> 38:13.949
Help!

38:14.120 --> 38:15.394
Get in.

38:16.520 --> 38:17.953
Ron, get us out of here.

38:25.120 --> 38:27.350
- Oh, my God!
- Ron!

38:32.720 --> 38:34.517
Mr. Luthor!

38:35.920 --> 38:37.512
No!

39:22.480 --> 39:24.118
Lex.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.592
You know...

39:28.760 --> 39:31.399
...part of me thought this was
another one of your tests.

39:31.920 --> 39:34.559
You've been abandoned and betrayed
so many times...

39:34.720 --> 39:37.109
...how could you know
that I wouldn't be next?

39:37.600 --> 39:40.398
Well, I'm not. I'm here.

39:40.920 --> 39:44.674
In spite of everything
that's happening out there, I'm here.

39:47.360 --> 39:49.555
I don't know what it is
you and I have...

39:50.840 --> 39:54.753
<i>...but</i> I'm here
because I wanna find out.

39:56.840 --> 39:58.478
Do you?
