WEBVTT

00:03.036 --> 00:04.437
- LAST WEEK

00:04.471 --> 00:06.306
ON THE<i>MILLION DOLLAR LISTING</i>
<i>NEW YORK REUNION...</i>

00:06.339 --> 00:08.174
[both squeal]
STAND UP.

00:08.208 --> 00:09.309
I WANT TO SHOW THE GUYS
HOW TIGHT YOUR PANTS ARE.

00:09.342 --> 00:11.444
- THEY'RE, LIKE,
A LITTLE TIGHT.

00:11.478 --> 00:13.013
- HAIR'S LOOKING GOOD.

00:13.046 --> 00:14.581
HOW LONG DID THAT TAKE?
- FIVE MINUTES.

00:14.614 --> 00:16.282
- DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
- [laughs]

00:16.316 --> 00:18.852
- FOR THREE SEASONS, I HAVE
OUTSOLD THE OTHER TWO GUYS.

00:18.885 --> 00:20.086
THAT'S A FACT.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.554
- LISTEN, YOU ALWAYS TALK
WITH THE SAME TONE,

00:21.588 --> 00:22.655
AND IT'S DISGUSTING.

00:22.689 --> 00:24.524
IF YOU KEEP BEING
THIS CLOSED-MINDED,

00:24.557 --> 00:26.059
YOU'LL NEVER LEARN ANYTHING.
- WHOA.

00:26.092 --> 00:27.961
THAT WAS THE MOST EVIL THING
ANYONE CAN DO.

00:27.994 --> 00:30.263
- I NEVER, EVER
WAS GOING TO PLAY

00:30.296 --> 00:32.132
YOUR PORNOGRAPHY
AT AN OPEN HOUSE.

00:32.165 --> 00:33.233
- YOU DIDN'T SHOW
THE MOVIE, NO,

00:33.266 --> 00:35.602
BUT YOU WANTED ME
TO HURT SO BADLY,

00:35.635 --> 00:36.870
SO YOU SUCCEEDED.

00:36.903 --> 00:38.405
CONGRATULATIONS.

00:38.438 --> 00:41.174
- I DON'T FEEL LIKE I'M EVER
GONNA WANT TO HAVE A CHILD.

00:41.207 --> 00:44.377
I HAVE NO DESIRE TO, EVER.

00:44.411 --> 00:45.879
- GREETINGS.

00:45.912 --> 00:47.914
- OH, MY GOD.

00:47.947 --> 00:49.516
- YOU'RE STILL
IN LOVE WITH HER.

00:49.549 --> 00:50.850
- [voice breaking] I'M SO AFRAID
OF LOSING MYSELF AGAIN

00:50.884 --> 00:52.052
THAT I'M MISSING OUT

00:52.085 --> 00:54.721
ON HAVING SOMEONE WITH ME
ALONG MY JOURNEY.

00:54.754 --> 00:56.823
I'VE BEEN
THROUGH SO MUCH, ANDY.

00:56.856 --> 00:57.824
I--

00:57.857 --> 00:59.926
[bleep].

00:59.959 --> 01:02.495
[crying]
I'M SORRY.

01:02.529 --> 01:04.698
[exhales deeply]

01:06.099 --> 01:08.435
[sniffles]
AH, [bleep].

01:10.136 --> 01:11.571
[sighs]

01:11.604 --> 01:15.608
I HAVE
AN INCREDIBLE JOURNEY, AND...

01:17.610 --> 01:20.613
I HAVE NOBODY...

01:20.647 --> 01:22.449
THAT HAD LIVED
THAT JOURNEY WITH ME,

01:22.482 --> 01:25.852
THAT CAN EXPLAIN
THAT JOURNEY TO OUR KIDS.

01:25.885 --> 01:28.922
AND I WANTED, AND I TRIED,
BUT THEN AGAIN,

01:28.955 --> 01:30.090
I FEEL LIKE I'M SO AFRAID

01:30.090 --> 01:31.658
THAT I SOMETIMES BECOME SELFISH
AND DECIDE

01:31.691 --> 01:34.227
I'D RATHER LOVE MYSELF MORE
AND NOT CHANGE THAT,

01:34.260 --> 01:35.362
BECAUSE I'M HAPPY NOW,

01:35.395 --> 01:37.764
THAN TO TAKE THE CHANCE
TO BE WITH SOMEONE,

01:37.797 --> 01:39.099
AND I WANT TO BE WITH SOMEONE,

01:39.099 --> 01:41.768
SO IT'S A VERY [bleep]-UP
INTERNAL CONFLICT,

01:41.801 --> 01:45.438
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHEN I'M GOING TO BE OVER THAT,

01:45.472 --> 01:49.175
AND I WANT TO SO BAD.

01:49.209 --> 01:52.445
[crying, exhales deeply]

01:52.479 --> 01:54.247
- DO YOU THINK
YOU'LL WIND UP WITH HER?

01:54.280 --> 01:56.783
- NO.
NO, NOT REALLY.

01:56.816 --> 01:58.785
I MEAN, WE'RE BOTH PAST THAT,

01:58.818 --> 02:02.589
AND SHE ALREADY HAS A BOYFRIEND,
AND SHE SEEMED VERY HAPPY.

02:02.622 --> 02:04.324
- HOW OLD ARE YOU?

02:04.357 --> 02:05.859
- I'M 27.

02:05.892 --> 02:08.061
- 27?
- YES.

02:08.061 --> 02:10.063
- YOU GOT A LOT
OF EMOTION, MAN.

02:10.063 --> 02:14.234
- LISTEN, MAN,
I LOVE LIFE, BRO...

02:14.267 --> 02:15.435
SO MUCH.

02:15.468 --> 02:19.806
[sniffles]

02:19.839 --> 02:22.442
I'M SORRY.

02:22.475 --> 02:24.644
- SHE WAS THE ONE GIRLFRIEND
YOU'VE HAD IN YOUR LIFE.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.546
- THE ONLY GIRLFRIEND.
- THE ONLY GIRLFRIEND.

02:26.579 --> 02:28.915
HAVE YOU BEEN DATING
IN NEW YORK?

02:28.948 --> 02:31.151
- I MEAN, I DATE.
I LOVE WOMEN.

02:31.184 --> 02:32.719
[laughter]

02:32.752 --> 02:35.555
YOU KNOW,
EVEN IF IT'S FOR ONE NIGHT,

02:35.588 --> 02:36.923
I STILL WANT TO LOVE
THAT PERSON.

02:36.956 --> 02:39.192
I THINK
IT'S PART OF THE EXPERIENCE,

02:39.225 --> 02:40.860
SEX IS MUCH BETTER.

02:40.894 --> 02:43.263
BUT I DO. I DO.
I DATE. I DATE, BUT--

02:43.296 --> 02:44.397
- I'M JUST CURIOUS--

02:44.431 --> 02:48.101
FREDRIK, DID YOU NOW
THIS PART OF LUIS?

02:48.134 --> 02:50.904
- NO, I MEAN, I DON'T THINK
WE KNEW THIS SIDE, BUT I KNEW--

02:50.937 --> 02:53.473
YOU SEE, I'VE ALWAYS LOVED LUIS
FOR HIS PASSION.

02:53.506 --> 02:55.241
THERE'S SOMETHING
INSIDE HIM THAT GLOW,

02:55.275 --> 02:56.943
THAT JUST COMES
OUT OF HIS EYES,

02:56.976 --> 02:58.645
SO IT HURTS ME TO SEE HIM,

02:58.678 --> 03:00.180
LIKE, SITTING THERE
BREAKING DOWN AND CRYING.

03:00.213 --> 03:01.247
- RYAN, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

03:01.281 --> 03:03.049
- NO, I DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT FIORELLA.

03:03.049 --> 03:04.718
I THINK SHE, UM...

03:04.751 --> 03:06.653
SUPER HOT.
- [laughs]

03:06.686 --> 03:08.755
IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
ONE GIRLFRIEND, I MEAN...

03:08.788 --> 03:10.223
[both laugh]
YOU KNOW...

03:10.256 --> 03:13.393
YOU ARE ALSO SUPER HOT.
- [laughs]

03:13.426 --> 03:15.495
- AND HER NAME IS BEAUTIFUL TOO,
RIGHT? FIORELLA.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.397
- WHAT'D SHE CALL YOU?
LUIGI?

03:17.430 --> 03:18.498
- [laughs] LUIGI, YEAH.
- LUIGI.

03:18.531 --> 03:21.301
- LUIGI.
- YEAH.

03:21.334 --> 03:24.304
- WELL, THIS SEASON,
WHEN IT CAME TO LOVE,

03:24.337 --> 03:28.308
RYAN AND EMILIA'S ROMANCE
WAS LIKE A ROLLER COASTER.

03:28.341 --> 03:29.943
HERE'S HOW IT WENT DOWN.

03:29.976 --> 03:31.077
- DO YOU LIKE THIS?

03:31.111 --> 03:33.079
THIS TIE WORK?
IT'S A LITTLE SHINY.

03:33.079 --> 03:34.447
- NO, I LIKE IT.
IT'S GOOD.

03:34.481 --> 03:37.183
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
I HAVE A REAL LIVE GIRLFRIEND.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.451
YOU ALMOST READY?

03:38.485 --> 03:39.886
- WE'RE WAITING ON YOU,
PRINCESS.

03:39.919 --> 03:44.090
- AND SHE'S GREAT, AS LONG
AS SHE OPERATES ON MY TERMS.

03:44.090 --> 03:46.960
- CAN YOU STOP FOR A SECOND
WITH THE PHONE?

03:46.993 --> 03:48.962
- WE'LL TALK
ABOUT THIS STUFF LATER.

03:48.995 --> 03:50.397
- NO, WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT IT NOW.

03:50.430 --> 03:52.899
- I DON'T WANT
TO TALK RIGHT NOW, THEN.

03:52.932 --> 03:57.137
- IF YOU DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING MORE TO GIVE ME,

03:57.170 --> 04:00.807
THEN I DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING ELSE TO GIVE YOU.

04:00.840 --> 04:03.410
- YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN
VERY VULNERABLE WITH PEOPLE.

04:03.443 --> 04:04.678
- DAMN IT.
[door slams]

04:04.711 --> 04:06.546
- AND THEN IT'S, LIKE,
A WEAK POINT FOR ME.

04:06.579 --> 04:07.547
I DON'T LIKE THAT.

04:07.580 --> 04:09.049
WHAT DO YOU WANT, EMILIA?

04:09.049 --> 04:10.784
- REAL RYAN.

04:10.817 --> 04:12.552
- EMILIA IS GIVING ME
A SECOND CHANCE.

04:12.585 --> 04:15.055
I JUST NEED TO BE SURE
THAT I DESERVE IT.

04:15.055 --> 04:16.790
I MET MY DAD
FOR THE FIRST TIME

04:16.823 --> 04:18.158
WHEN I WAS IN FOURTH GRADE.

04:18.191 --> 04:19.726
I HAVE TWO DADS, BY THE WAY.

04:19.759 --> 04:21.561
I CALLED THEM
DAD-DAD AND BOB-DAD,

04:21.594 --> 04:26.332
AND THAT MOMENT STARTED
THIS KIND OF SERIES OF TRIPS

04:26.366 --> 04:29.069
WHERE I STARTED SEEING
MY BIOLOGICAL DAD.

04:29.069 --> 04:30.136
YOU KNOW, GOING BETWEEN

04:30.170 --> 04:32.072
BOB-DAD AND PARENTS,
BOB-DAD AND PARENTS,

04:32.072 --> 04:34.074
I FELT LIKE HALF OF MY BODY

04:34.074 --> 04:36.209
WAS BEING,
LIKE, RIPPED APART,

04:36.242 --> 04:38.078
AND I NEVER REALLY TALKED
ABOUT THIS BEFORE.

04:38.078 --> 04:39.813
- DOESN'T IT FEEL GOOD?

04:39.846 --> 04:42.082
- YES, IT DOES.

04:42.082 --> 04:44.084
- [laughs]

04:44.084 --> 04:45.385
- REMEMBER HOW YOU SAID

04:45.418 --> 04:46.853
I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU
AND I DON'T LOVE YOU?

04:46.886 --> 04:48.121
I'VE BEEN TEACHING MYSELF
TO BALLROOM DANCE

04:48.154 --> 04:49.222
FOR THE LAST THREE MONTHS,

04:49.255 --> 04:51.091
SO I CAN TAKE YOU DANCING
IN CENTRAL PARK

04:51.124 --> 04:52.826
IN FRONT OF ALL THESE PEOPLE,

04:52.859 --> 04:55.195
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU
AND YOU'RE WORTH IT TO ME.

04:55.228 --> 04:56.463
- [laughs]

04:56.496 --> 04:57.964
- EMILIA HAS MADE ME
REALIZE THAT I CAN DO

04:57.997 --> 04:59.399
WHATEVER IT IS
I NEED TO DO

04:59.432 --> 05:01.134
TO BE AS SUCCESSFUL
I WANT TO BE.

05:01.167 --> 05:02.702
AND NOW I'M NOT JUST
DOING IT FOR MYSELF.

05:02.736 --> 05:04.504
I'M DOING IT FOR MYSELF

05:04.537 --> 05:06.906
AND A BEAUTIFUL
LITTLE GREEK GIRL.

05:06.940 --> 05:09.042
- [laughs]

05:09.042 --> 05:10.610
- DID YOU THINK

05:10.643 --> 05:12.412
YOU WERE GONNA GET A PROPOSAL
THAT DAY, BY THE WAY?

05:12.445 --> 05:14.681
- NO, BECAUSE IF HE KNOWS ME
WELL ENOUGH,

05:14.714 --> 05:15.849
HE WOULD NOT DO THAT.

05:15.882 --> 05:17.650
- HOW ROMANTIC WAS THAT
FOR YOU?

05:17.684 --> 05:19.686
IT WAS SO ROMANTIC TO WATCH.

05:19.719 --> 05:22.055
- IT WAS VERY ROMANTIC.
IT WAS VERY SWEET.

05:22.055 --> 05:23.223
HE'S A ROMANTIC GUY.

05:23.256 --> 05:25.592
HE DOESN'T COME ACROSS
AS A ROMANTIC GUY,

05:25.625 --> 05:26.726
BUT HE REALLY IS.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.261
IT'S JUST IN SPURTS...

05:28.294 --> 05:29.496
- [laughs]
- HERE AND THERE.

05:29.529 --> 05:30.730
- WHAT'S THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE

05:30.764 --> 05:32.532
BETWEEN HOW HE APPEARS
ON TELEVISION

05:32.565 --> 05:34.200
AND THE RYAN THAT YOU KNOW?

05:34.234 --> 05:35.902
- THERE'S
A VERY BIG DIFFERENCE.

05:35.935 --> 05:37.637
RYAN'S A SWEETHEART.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.639
HE REALLY IS.
HE IS A VERY GENUINE PERSON.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.675
HE IS VERY GOOD-HEARTED.

05:41.708 --> 05:43.443
HE'S VERY LOYAL.

05:43.476 --> 05:45.078
HE'S A BIG KID.

05:45.078 --> 05:48.615
I THINK HE COMES ACROSS
A CERTAIN WAY,

05:48.648 --> 05:51.084
AND IT'S KIND OF PAINFUL
TO WATCH SOMETIMES,

05:51.084 --> 05:53.887
BECAUSE HE SHOWS ME
A VERY DIFFERENT PERSON.

05:53.920 --> 05:57.090
- WERE YOU DETERRED AT ALL

05:57.123 --> 05:59.426
BY HOW HE APPEARED
ON THE SHOW?

05:59.459 --> 06:01.661
- HE HAD THAT FRONT
WHEN I MET HIM.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.297
- OH, OKAY.
- HE WAS VERY ARROGANT.

06:04.330 --> 06:07.200
BUT THAT WAS PART OF THE REASON
WHY I WAS INTRIGUED,

06:07.233 --> 06:09.135
BECAUSE HE WAS--
HE HAD THAT--

06:09.169 --> 06:11.304
REALLY,
HE HAD THAT WIT ABOUT HIM.

06:11.338 --> 06:14.541
I COULD SEE THE HUMOR
BEHIND THAT.

06:14.574 --> 06:16.376
- HAVE YOUR PARENTS SEEN
THE SHOW?

06:16.409 --> 06:17.377
- NO.

06:17.410 --> 06:20.046
- GOOD.
[laughter]

06:20.080 --> 06:21.548
- WHAT DOES RYAN MEAN
WHEN HE SAYS,

06:21.581 --> 06:24.684
"EVERYTHING'S GOOD AS LONG
AS SHE PLAYS BY MY RULES"?

06:24.718 --> 06:26.386
- HE KNOWS I SET ALL THE RULES.

06:26.419 --> 06:27.587
- [sighs] THAT'S TRUE.
- [laughs]

06:27.620 --> 06:29.122
- THAT WAS JUST ME
MAKING MYSELF FEEL BETTER.

06:29.155 --> 06:30.323
- YEAH, PROBABLY.

06:30.357 --> 06:32.158
- YEAH, SHE CHOSE
THESE TIGHT PANTS FOR ME.

06:32.192 --> 06:35.762
- RYAN, WE SAW YOU DATING
AND SLEEPING AROUND

06:35.795 --> 06:38.264
BEFORE YOU TWO HEATED UP.

06:38.298 --> 06:41.301
WHAT WAS IT ABOUT EMILIA

06:41.334 --> 06:44.771
THAT MADE YOU WANT TO BE
WITH HER ONLY?

06:44.804 --> 06:45.872
- SHE'S THE ONLY PERSON
THAT I'VE EVERY KNOWN

06:45.905 --> 06:48.575
WHO CHALLENGES ME
ON AN EVEN KEEL.

06:48.608 --> 06:50.977
YOU KNOW, MY SENSE OF HUMOR

06:51.077 --> 06:53.413
AND KIND OF THE WAY
I PUSH PEOPLE--

06:53.446 --> 06:57.083
FROM THE MOMENT WE FIRST MET,
SHE CAME RIGHT BACK AT ME,

06:57.117 --> 07:00.253
AND NO ONE ELSE
HAS EVER DONE THAT, GUY OR GIRL.

07:00.286 --> 07:02.022
AND I THINK AT THAT POINT,
IT WAS, LIKE,

07:02.022 --> 07:04.224
"DONE.
LET'S DO THIS."

07:04.257 --> 07:06.426
THEN SHE DIDN'T CALL ME BACK
FOR, LIKE, THREE MONTHS.

07:06.459 --> 07:08.628
- SMART.
SMART.

07:08.661 --> 07:11.598
JEN FROM SHERRILL, NEW YORK,
SAID, "RYAN, LOOKING BACK,

07:11.631 --> 07:13.466
"DO YOU FELL YOU CAN BE COLD
AND INSENSITIVE

07:13.500 --> 07:15.635
TO YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S FEELINGS?"

07:15.669 --> 07:16.803
- YES.

07:16.836 --> 07:18.271
YES, I CAN.

07:18.304 --> 07:20.073
I AM WORKING ON IT.

07:20.106 --> 07:22.108
- ARE YOU?
- I AM. I AM.

07:22.142 --> 07:26.346
I'M INCREDIBLY SELFISH,
AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S THE--

07:26.379 --> 07:27.614
WHAT DO WE CALL IT?
IT'S "THE RYAN SHOW"?

07:27.647 --> 07:29.049
- IT IS "THE RYAN SHOW."
- IT IS "THE RYAN SHOW."

07:29.082 --> 07:31.351
- I LIVE IN "THE RYAN SHOW."
- YEAH.

07:31.384 --> 07:33.053
YOU HAVE
A STARRING ROLE, THOUGH.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.221
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
LIKE, WHAT'S THE PROB--

07:35.255 --> 07:36.956
- WHEN YOU SEE
THE CHARMINATOR ON THE SHOW,

07:37.057 --> 07:38.458
WHEN YOU SEE HIM FLIRTING
WITH OTHER WOMEN

07:38.491 --> 07:40.326
AND GETTING
ALL HANDSY WITH THEM,

07:40.360 --> 07:41.461
DOES THAT BUG YOU?

07:41.494 --> 07:43.296
- NO.

07:43.329 --> 07:45.765
HE'S 29 YEARS OLD.
HE'S A GOOD-LOOKING GUY.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.100
IT'S THE NATURE
OF HIS BUSINESS.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.568
HE'S GONNA FLIRT.

07:48.601 --> 07:50.637
I MEAN, I KNOW RYAN LIKE
THE BACK OF MY HAND,

07:50.670 --> 07:53.239
AND WHAT HE DOES IS HARMLESS.
- RIGHT.

07:53.273 --> 07:54.874
- AND IF I DIDN'T REALLY
FEEL SECURE

07:54.908 --> 07:59.079
IN WHAT WE HAVE TOGETHER,
THEN I COULD NOT DATE HIM.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.081
- YOU'RE IN A MONOGAMOUS
RELATIONSHIP, RIGHT, RYAN?

08:01.114 --> 08:03.316
- YEAH. YEAH.
- YES.

08:03.350 --> 08:05.151
WHAT DOES "MONOGAMY" MEAN?
- [laughs]

08:05.185 --> 08:07.520
- ONLY EMILIA, FOREVER.
- IT'S A GREEK WORD.

08:07.554 --> 08:08.788
YOU KNOW THAT?
- DO YOU LIVE TOGETHER?

08:08.822 --> 08:09.789
- IS IT GREEK?
- OF COURSE.

08:09.823 --> 08:10.790
- YEAH.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.025
- DO YOU LIVE TOGETHER?
- UH-HUH.

08:12.025 --> 08:13.793
- YOU DO? WOW.
- IT'S RECENT.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.395
WE'LL SEE.
- THIS IS BIG.

08:15.428 --> 08:17.297
- [laughs]
- THIS IS BIG.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.032
WILL WE ALL BE INVITED
TO YOUR WEDDING?

08:19.065 --> 08:21.334
- I DON'T KNOW.
ARE YOU GONNA INVITE THESE GUYS?

08:21.368 --> 08:22.569
- OF COURSE.

08:22.602 --> 08:24.037
- IT WAS REALLY SWEET
WATCHING YOU

08:24.070 --> 08:27.607
OPEN UP TO EMILIA THIS SEASON
ABOUT YOUR DADS.

08:27.640 --> 08:30.176
- YEAH.
- WAS THAT HARD TO DO ON CAMERA?

08:30.210 --> 08:33.913
- THAT WAS DEFINITELY
A TOUGH SCENE FOR ME.

08:33.947 --> 08:36.549
LIKE, I HAD, LIKE,
THE GREATEST CHILDHOOD

08:36.583 --> 08:38.051
IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.

08:38.084 --> 08:41.254
LIKE, MY MOM AND MY DAD--THEY'RE
INCREDIBLE, AND I LOVE THEM.

08:41.287 --> 08:43.857
TALKING ABOUT BOB-DAD

08:43.890 --> 08:47.260
IS SOMETHING
I DON'T DO THAT OFTEN,

08:47.293 --> 08:48.261
JUST 'CAUSE IT'S PERSONAL.

08:48.294 --> 08:51.898
BUT I WAS TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT WHY...

08:51.931 --> 08:54.100
LIKE, WHEN YOU'RE UPSET, WHY AM
I JUST, LIKE, SHUTTING OFF?

08:54.134 --> 08:56.469
AND I THINK I'VE BEEN ABLE
TO TRACK IT BACK TO JUST BEING

08:56.503 --> 08:59.639
A LITTLE KID
AND BEING OVERLY EMOTIONAL.

08:59.673 --> 09:03.009
I MEAN, LIKE, YOU KNOW...

09:03.009 --> 09:04.711
MY NICKNAME WAS "CRYIN' RYAN."

09:04.744 --> 09:06.312
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

09:06.346 --> 09:08.748
AND I TRIED TO CHANGE IT
TO "RYAN THE LION,"

09:08.782 --> 09:10.316
AND NO ONE BOUGHT IT.
[laughter]

09:10.350 --> 09:11.451
AND I EVENTUALLY JUST--

09:11.484 --> 09:14.054
I THINK IT BECAME
TOO PAINFUL, RIGHT,

09:14.087 --> 09:16.823
TO BE THAT EMOTIONAL
ALL THE TIME,

09:16.856 --> 09:19.859
TO BE THAT SENSITIVE,
TO SHOW SO MUCH,

09:19.893 --> 09:21.661
BECAUSE WHEN YOU WEAR
YOUR EMOTIONS ON YOUR SLEEVE,

09:21.695 --> 09:23.329
PEOPLE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF YOU.

09:23.363 --> 09:27.567
AND SO I SUBCONSCIOUSLY
TURNED THAT OFF.

09:27.600 --> 09:31.037
SO TURNING IT BACK ON
WHEN YOU'RE OLDER

09:31.071 --> 09:32.906
IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DO.

09:32.939 --> 09:35.342
- EMILIA, WHAT WOULD YOU CHANGE
ABOUT RYAN?

09:35.375 --> 09:36.343
- HMM.
- HMM.

09:36.376 --> 09:37.377
- HMM.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.611
- WHAT WOULD I CHANGE
ABOUT RYAN?

09:38.645 --> 09:39.913
- MM-HMM?

09:39.946 --> 09:41.147
- I ONLY GET ONE THING--
ONE CHOICE?

09:41.181 --> 09:42.949
- NO.
- [laughs]

09:43.049 --> 09:44.084
- NICE.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.319
- I REALLY WANT HIM
TO START TO BE PRESENT,

09:46.353 --> 09:48.955
NOT FOR ME, FOR HIM...
- WOW.

09:49.055 --> 09:50.757
- BECAUSE I LOVE HIM.

09:50.790 --> 09:53.760
WITH OR WITHOUT ME,
I WANT HIM TO BE HAPPY.

09:53.793 --> 09:55.862
- WE SPENT
A LITTLE TIME EARLIER TALKING

09:55.895 --> 09:57.731
ABOUT HOW LAST SEASON ENDED.

09:57.764 --> 10:00.767
- IN THE SCENE YOU'RE ABOUT
TO WATCH, THEY TAKE IT.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.135
THIS SPEECH IS
IN DIRECT REFERENCE

10:02.168 --> 10:05.271
TO AN ADULT FILM
THAT FREDRIK STARRED IN.

10:05.305 --> 10:06.906
- I'M COMPLETELY HUMILIATED.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.241
- WHAT DID YOU THINK, EMILIA,

10:08.274 --> 10:10.443
OF WHAT RYAN DID
IN THAT EPISODE?

10:10.477 --> 10:13.380
- I DO HAVE TO SAY THIS--
I'M VERY PROTECTIVE OF RYAN,

10:13.413 --> 10:15.081
AND I KNOW VERY WELL

10:15.115 --> 10:18.318
THAT SOMETHING
REALLY PUSHED HIS BUTTONS.

10:18.351 --> 10:20.687
AND WE'RE POINTING
THE FINGER AT RYAN,

10:20.720 --> 10:22.222
AND HOW DARE HE DO THIS?
AND HOW DARE HE DO THAT?

10:22.255 --> 10:24.324
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER SIDE OF IT?

10:24.357 --> 10:26.926
- I KNOW THAT YOU WERE THERE
AT THAT EVENT.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.928
WHAT WAS GOING
THROUGH YOUR MIND,

10:28.962 --> 10:30.397
AND HOW DID YOU FEEL?

10:30.430 --> 10:32.899
- I FELT AS HUMILIATED
AS HE DID.

10:32.932 --> 10:35.902
I FELT REALLY AWFUL
FOR FREDRIK.

10:35.935 --> 10:38.004
AND IF I COULD SAY
MY HEART BROKE, IT DID,

10:38.038 --> 10:40.573
BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE
TO JUST HOLD YOUR HEAD HIGH

10:40.607 --> 10:41.841
AND WALK OUT.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.977
- HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT RYAN TODAY?

10:44.010 --> 10:45.745
- I DON'T KNOW RYAN
AS A PERSON.

10:45.779 --> 10:47.547
YOU KNOW,
I CAN'T JUDGE HIM

10:47.580 --> 10:51.117
ON WHAT I SEE OF HIM
IN THE SHOW.

10:51.151 --> 10:54.487
FRED'S NEVER SAID ANYTHING BAD
ABOUT RYAN TO ME,

10:54.521 --> 10:57.223
SO I'VE GOT NO REASON
TO HOLD A GRUDGE AGAINST YOU.

10:57.257 --> 10:59.325
- ANYTHING YOU WANT TO SAY
TO DEREK

10:59.359 --> 11:01.361
OR ANYTHING THAT YOU...

11:01.394 --> 11:02.862
DO YOU HAVE ANY RESPONSE
TO HIM

11:02.896 --> 11:05.331
TALKING ABOUT HOW HUMILIATED
HE WAS THAT DAY?

11:05.365 --> 11:07.934
- I MEAN, I HAD NO IDEA
YOU WERE COMING.

11:07.967 --> 11:10.270
I'M SURPRISED
HE DIDN'T TRY TO KILL ME.

11:10.303 --> 11:13.740
HE'S REALLY BIG.
HAVE YOU SEEN HIM?

11:13.773 --> 11:16.543
HE'S, LIKE, FROM SOUTH AFRICA.

11:16.576 --> 11:17.744
LIKE, I COULD'VE DIED.

11:17.777 --> 11:19.312
- OBVIOUSLY,
YOU WEREN'T SCARED ENOUGH,

11:19.346 --> 11:20.847
'CAUSE YOU STILL WENT AHEAD
WITH IT, DIDN'T YOU?

11:20.880 --> 11:23.416
- WELL, I MOVED IN REALLY
QUICKLY, AND THEN I MOVED OUT.

11:23.450 --> 11:25.452
I WENT BACK. I WAS LIKE,
"IS DEREK STILL THERE?"

11:25.485 --> 11:27.854
- WELL, THANK YOU,
DEREK AND EMILIA,

11:27.887 --> 11:29.155
FOR BEING HERE.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.424
WE WISH OF YOU ALL THE BEST
IN YOUR RELATIONSHIPS.

11:31.458 --> 11:33.593
YOU TOO, BUDDY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

11:33.626 --> 11:34.761
COMING UP...

11:34.794 --> 11:36.096
IT'S A BROMANCE.

11:36.129 --> 11:37.230
- I WANT TO SEE
HOW LONG

11:37.263 --> 11:38.431
THEIR "BROMANCE" KEEPS TOGETHER.

11:38.465 --> 11:40.166
- YOU CAME OVER,
AND YOU WERE LIKE,

11:40.200 --> 11:42.102
"I'M GOING TO MAKE
YOU SWALLOW YOUR TEETH."

11:42.135 --> 11:44.371
- HERE WE GO--
ALREADY UNRAVELING.

11:50.510 --> 11:51.845
- WE ARE BACK

11:51.878 --> 11:54.814
WITH THE<i>MILLION DOLLAR LISTING</i>
<i>NEW YORK REUNION.</i>

11:54.848 --> 11:57.851
NOW, ONE QUESTION
FOR ALL THREE OF YOU--

11:57.884 --> 12:01.087
HOW MANY, IN YOUR CAREER,
CLIENTS HAVE YOU SLEPT WITH?

12:01.121 --> 12:03.623
- I THINK EVERY TIME I SEE YOU,
YOU ASK ME THIS QUESTION.

12:03.656 --> 12:05.959
- I KNOW. WELL, IT'S
AN INTERESTING QUESTION.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.761
- YOU KNOW, HONESTLY...

12:07.794 --> 12:10.096
I TRIED TO REMEMBER WHAT
MY ANSWERS WERE PREVIOUSLY...

12:10.130 --> 12:11.664
- WELL--
- SO THE MATH STAYS THE SAME.

12:11.698 --> 12:13.233
- WELL, IF IT'S REAL...

12:13.266 --> 12:14.768
- I DON'T REMEMBER.
- IT'LL STAY THE SAME.

12:14.801 --> 12:16.336
- MAYBE ONE.
- MAYBE ONE.

12:16.369 --> 12:17.771
- YEAH.
- LESS THAN TEN.

12:17.804 --> 12:19.539
- LESS THAN TEN.
- OKAY.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.141
- IT'S A GOOD WAY TO DO THAT.
- OKAY, LESS THAN TEN.

12:21.174 --> 12:23.276
HOW MANY CLIENTS
HAVE YOU SLEPT WITH?

12:23.309 --> 12:24.611
- ONE.

12:24.644 --> 12:25.645
- ONE?
- YES.

12:25.679 --> 12:27.113
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?
- NEVER.

12:27.147 --> 12:28.148
- COME ON.

12:28.181 --> 12:29.849
- NO, I NEVER HAVE.
I NEVER HAVE.

12:29.883 --> 12:30.984
NO, NEVER.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.485
- HERE'S ANOTHER QUESTION--

12:32.519 --> 12:34.821
JOAN FROM
MEDIA, PENNSYLVANIA, SAID,

12:34.854 --> 12:37.123
"LUIS, WHAT DO YOU USE
IN YOUR HAIR--SHELLAC?

12:37.157 --> 12:39.125
"IT LOOKS GREAT,
BUT IT DOESN'T EVER SEEM

12:39.159 --> 12:42.095
TO MOVE INDEPENDENTLY
OF YOUR BODY."

12:42.095 --> 12:44.631
- [laughing]
YOU HAVE TO LAUGH AT IT.

12:44.664 --> 12:45.965
I USE SPRAY.
THAT'S ALL I USE.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.133
- YOU DO? JUST SPRAY.
- YEAH.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.268
JUST SPRAY.
- CAN I TOUCH IT?

12:48.301 --> 12:50.103
- YEAH, BUT BE GENTLE, PLEASE.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.338
THERE YOU GO.
- OKAY, YEAH, IT'S VERY SPRAYED.

12:51.371 --> 12:52.872
- YES.
- OKAY.

12:52.906 --> 12:56.509
WELL, THERE WAS
ONE MORE BUDDING ROMANCE

12:56.543 --> 12:58.478
THAT WE JUST CAN'T FORGET
TO MENTION--

12:58.511 --> 13:00.680
RYAN AND LUIS.

13:00.714 --> 13:02.215
THEY GOT OFF
ON THE WRONG FOOT,

13:02.248 --> 13:04.284
BUT ONCE THEY REALLY GOT
TO KNOW EACH OTHER,

13:04.317 --> 13:05.819
THINGS CHANGED FOR THE BETTER.

13:05.852 --> 13:07.387
WATCH.

13:07.420 --> 13:08.555
- WHAT THE [bleep]
ARE YOU DOING?

13:08.588 --> 13:09.689
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

13:09.723 --> 13:10.724
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WHAT DO I MEAN?

13:10.757 --> 13:12.058
- CAN YOU GO GET ME
MORE CHAMPAGNE?

13:12.058 --> 13:13.059
- JUST STOP.

13:13.059 --> 13:14.561
RYAN HAS DISRESPECTED ME

13:14.594 --> 13:16.229
SINCE THE VERY FIRST DAY
I'VE MET HIM.

13:16.262 --> 13:17.263
- YES.
- OH, YOU HAVE AN OPEN HOUSE?

13:17.297 --> 13:18.631
- YES, I HAVE AN OPEN HOUSE.
- HUH.

13:18.665 --> 13:20.533
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I THOUGHT YOU WORKED HERE.

13:20.567 --> 13:23.570
GOOD LUCK. THERE'S A LOT
OF COMPETITION IN THE BUILDING.

13:23.603 --> 13:25.939
GOOD TO MEET YOU.
- SCUMBAG.

13:25.972 --> 13:28.508
THIS IS MY SELLER,
WHO I'VE WORKED SO HARD TO GET.

13:28.541 --> 13:30.610
- IT'S SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND
WHEN YOU SPEAK SO FAST.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.078
LA, LA, LA, LA, LA.

13:32.078 --> 13:33.079
- ALL RIGHT.

13:33.079 --> 13:34.781
WHAT I JUST DID RIGHT NOW

13:34.814 --> 13:36.149
IS EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO ME.

13:36.182 --> 13:37.550
- DON'T DO THAT.

13:37.584 --> 13:38.952
- WHY WOULD HE TAKE OUT
MY POCKET SQUARE?

13:38.985 --> 13:40.320
I'M GONNA TAKE OUT
HIS POCKET SQUARE.

13:40.353 --> 13:41.588
- LISTEN TO ME.

13:41.621 --> 13:42.856
- WHY DID YOU DO THAT?
THAT'S REALLY EXPENSIVE.

13:42.889 --> 13:44.324
- I DON'T GIVE A [bleep].
LISTEN TO ME.

13:44.357 --> 13:45.859
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO [bleep]
THIS UP FOR ME.

13:45.892 --> 13:47.594
- I'M GOING TO WAIT FOR YOU
TO [bleep] IT UP.

13:47.627 --> 13:50.163
- I WILL BREAK YOUR TEETH
NEXT TIME YOU ACTUALLY DO THIS,

13:50.196 --> 13:51.231
I SWEAR TO GOD.

13:51.264 --> 13:53.099
- REACH HIGH.

13:53.133 --> 13:56.102
YOU WANT THIS IN YOUR MOUTH?

13:56.102 --> 13:57.637
- CAN YOU TAKE THIS GUY
OUT OF HERE, PLEASE?

13:57.671 --> 13:59.372
GUYS TAKE HIM OUT.
- I'M OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

13:59.406 --> 14:00.774
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

14:00.807 --> 14:02.308
- EVERY FAIRY TALE
HAS AN OGRE.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.310
YOU KNOW THAT LITTLE MONSTER
THAT COMES IN THE FAIRY TALES?

14:04.344 --> 14:06.046
THAT'S RYAN.
- I GOT THIS GUY.

14:06.046 --> 14:07.580
HE WANTS, LIKE,
A BIG FOUR-BEDROOM,

14:07.614 --> 14:10.617
AND 30 LINCOLN PLAZA
WOULD BE AWESOME,

14:10.650 --> 14:15.488
BUT MY BIGGEST CONTACT
THERE IS LUIS.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.524
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST TRY
AND REACH OUT TO HIM?

14:17.557 --> 14:18.692
[line trilling]

14:18.725 --> 14:21.961
- RYAN, TELL ME WHAT
YOU BROUGHT ME HERE FOR.

14:22.062 --> 14:24.664
- SO I HAVE A BUYER
WHO'D BE GOOD FOR 30 LINCOLN.

14:24.698 --> 14:25.832
I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU,

14:25.865 --> 14:27.701
AND I WANT TO WORK
WITH YOU ALONE.

14:27.734 --> 14:29.569
I KNOW THAT YOU AND I HAVE
BOTH HAD SOME DIFFERENCES

14:29.602 --> 14:30.737
HERE AND THERE.

14:30.770 --> 14:32.339
- BUT YOU KNOW WHY.
- I KNOW. I KNOW.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.473
I'M AN [bleep]HOLE.
I GET IT.

14:33.506 --> 14:35.308
- YOU STARTED OUT
OFF THE WRONG FOOT.

14:35.342 --> 14:36.743
- I AM FULLY AWARE.

14:36.776 --> 14:38.945
- THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

14:38.978 --> 14:42.082
THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN RYAN
BEING A PROFESSIONAL.

14:42.082 --> 14:43.516
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH
THE DEVELOPER IS SO IMPORTANT,

14:43.550 --> 14:44.951
I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT THIS WAS REAL

14:44.984 --> 14:47.420
BEFORE I, YOU KNOW, PUT YOU
IN TOUCH WITH ANYBODY.

14:47.454 --> 14:48.488
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

14:48.521 --> 14:49.789
- LAST WEEK I HAD BEEN
WITH FREDRIK.

14:49.823 --> 14:51.257
- YOU DO NOT NEED THAT GUY.

14:51.291 --> 14:52.692
- YOU CAN'T TRUST ANYBODY
IN THIS BUSINESS, ALL RIGHT?

14:52.726 --> 14:54.627
HE'S A PIECE OF [bleep].

14:54.661 --> 14:55.995
FORGET ABOUT FREDRIK.

14:56.096 --> 14:57.330
I'M JUST HAPPY TO BE ALIVE.

14:57.364 --> 14:59.232
-<i>SALUD.</i>

14:59.265 --> 15:00.633
- ANOTHER ROUND.

15:00.667 --> 15:01.735
- THE NIGHT'S JUST
GETTING STARTED.

15:01.768 --> 15:03.036
YOU STILL HAVE
YOUR CLOTHES ON.

15:03.069 --> 15:04.204
- WHAT? YOU'RE TRYING TO TAKE
MY CLOTHES OFF?

15:04.237 --> 15:05.405
- I'M NOT TRYING TO TAKE
YOUR CLOTHES OFF.

15:05.438 --> 15:06.740
DON'T MAKE THIS A WEIRD THING.
- [laughs]

15:06.773 --> 15:08.074
RYAN IS COMPLETELY
A DIFFERENT PERSON

15:08.108 --> 15:09.809
THAN WHAT I EXPECTED.

15:09.843 --> 15:11.311
THIS IS FOR SHOWING ME
THAT APARTMENT.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.046
IT'S $20,000.

15:13.046 --> 15:14.914
- I HAVE TO ADMIT,
YOU HAVE IMPRESSED ME, MAN.

15:14.948 --> 15:17.384
- GOING FORWARD, YOU AND I--
WE TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER.

15:17.417 --> 15:20.720
- YOU'RE GOOD PEOPLE, RYAN.
I MEAN THAT.

15:22.322 --> 15:25.425
- AN INTERESTING ALLIANCE--
VERY SWEET.

15:25.458 --> 15:26.760
IT'S A BROMANCE.

15:26.793 --> 15:28.428
- WELL, YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN
A GREAT GUY.

15:28.461 --> 15:30.730
YOU JUST HAD A HARD TIME
FINDING THAT OUT,

15:30.764 --> 15:33.099
BECAUSE ALL THE STUFF
THAT YOU'VE DONE ON THIS

15:33.133 --> 15:34.334
IS REALLY DISGUSTING.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.770
I THINK, YOU KNOW,
EVERYBODY THAT DOES REAL ESTATE

15:36.803 --> 15:38.338
COME FROM
A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE,

15:38.371 --> 15:40.173
AND THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE
SOMETHING OUT OF THEIR LIFE,

15:40.206 --> 15:41.474
AND WHEN THEY ARE PUTTING HEART
AND EFFORT INTO THINGS,

15:41.508 --> 15:44.678
YOU COME INTO THIS OPEN HOUSE,
AND YOU DESTROY IT.

15:44.711 --> 15:46.579
BUT IT FEELS TO ME,
NOW THAT I GET TO KNOW YOU

15:46.613 --> 15:48.348
A LITTLE BIT BETTER,
YOU WERE SAYING THINGS, LIKE,

15:48.381 --> 15:50.383
YOU KNOW, YOU WERE
ALWAYS CALLED "CRYIN' RYAN."

15:50.417 --> 15:52.085
YOU WANTED TO MAKE IT
"LION RYAN."

15:52.085 --> 15:53.586
AND, YOU KNOW,
YOU'VE BECOME THIS PERSON

15:53.620 --> 15:55.088
THAT YOU THINK YOU NEED
TO BECOME

15:55.088 --> 15:56.222
IN ORDER FOR PEOPLE
TO RESPECT YOU,

15:56.256 --> 15:57.557
IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL
IN THIS BUSINESS,

15:57.590 --> 15:59.225
AND YOU HAVE ACTUALLY
[bleep] YOURSELF.

15:59.259 --> 16:00.894
- DO YOU THINK RYAN
IS CONDESCENDING?

16:00.927 --> 16:05.265
- YEAH, I THINK
IT'S A PROTECTION

16:05.298 --> 16:06.733
IN ORDER FOR OWN INSECURITIES.

16:06.766 --> 16:07.834
THAT'S WHAT I FELT.

16:07.867 --> 16:09.235
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THIS BROMANCE?

16:09.269 --> 16:11.438
- WELL, I THINK IT'S CUTE.
I MEAN...

16:11.471 --> 16:13.673
VERY ODD AT THE SAME TIME,

16:13.707 --> 16:15.809
BECAUSE LIKE I SAY
IN THE SEASON,

16:15.842 --> 16:17.677
NOT ONLY THAT SCENE
WHEN I SEE THEM TOGETHER,

16:17.711 --> 16:20.046
LAST TIME I HEARD
ABOUT LUIS AND RYAN,

16:20.046 --> 16:21.581
LUIS WAS COMPLAINING TO ME

16:21.614 --> 16:23.516
THAT RYAN HAD PUSHED
A POCKET SQUARE IN HIS MOUTH.

16:23.550 --> 16:24.584
- I WASN'T COMPLAINING.

16:24.617 --> 16:26.086
- NOW, WATCHING THE FOOTAGE

16:26.119 --> 16:28.488
OF THE TWO OF THEM TOGETHER,
DRINKING TEQUILA,

16:28.521 --> 16:30.390
GETTING DRUNK,
AND COMING TOGETHER

16:30.423 --> 16:32.859
IN THEIR DISLIKE FOR ME...

16:32.892 --> 16:34.394
I MEAN, WHAT CAN I SAY?

16:34.427 --> 16:36.396
YOU KNOW, IT'S GONNA
BE INTERESTING TO SEE

16:36.429 --> 16:38.631
HOW LONG THEIR BROMANCE
KEEPS TOGETHER.

16:38.665 --> 16:39.966
- I DON'T THINK IT
THAT IT'S A BROMANCE.

16:40.066 --> 16:42.502
I THINK, YOU KNOW, IT'S
A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF THE WAY

16:42.535 --> 16:44.304
WE SEE OUR RELATIONSHIP,
YOU KNOW.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.406
IT'S NOT, LIKE, YOU KNOW...
- YOU KNOW BOTH THESE GUYS.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.074
HOW DO YOU THINK
THIS BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP

16:48.108 --> 16:49.275
IS GONNA END?

16:49.309 --> 16:50.810
- I DON'T KNOW.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.212
I MEAN, LET'S SEE.
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

16:52.245 --> 16:55.615
- I GO TO ASK YOU
ABOUT THAT "POCKET SQUARE GATE."

16:55.648 --> 16:56.649
- YEAH.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.184
- HOW DID YOU CONTROL
YOUR TEMPER?

16:58.218 --> 16:59.386
- I HAVE NO IDEA,

16:59.419 --> 17:01.154
BUT I WAS SO PROUD THAT I DID.

17:01.187 --> 17:02.489
- YOU TOOK IT
OUT OF MY POCKET.

17:02.522 --> 17:05.725
- IT WAS A CLASSY WAY
OF PUNCHING YOU IN THE FACE.

17:05.759 --> 17:07.093
I NEEDED TO DO SOMETHING.

17:07.127 --> 17:08.461
- I DON'T THINK
THAT'S REALLY COOL.

17:08.495 --> 17:11.097
- LISTEN, GOOD THING
THAT I DIDN'T ACTUALLY LOST IT

17:11.131 --> 17:13.299
AND WENT AT YOU
LIKE THERE WAS NO TOMORROW.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.568
- YOU HAD ME ESCORTED
BY FIVE SECURITY GUARDS.

17:15.602 --> 17:17.070
IT'S KIND OF--
I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW.

17:17.103 --> 17:18.738
THESE TWO GUYS--EVERY TIME
I GO TO THEIR OPEN HOUSES,

17:18.772 --> 17:20.640
THEY HAVE ME ESCORTED OUT
BY SECURITY.

17:20.674 --> 17:21.841
- WHERE'S THAT
POCKET SQUARE NOW?

17:21.875 --> 17:23.610
- YEAH, WHERE IS
THAT POCKETS SQUARE?

17:23.643 --> 17:26.312
- I CLEANED
MY BATHROOM WITH IT.

17:26.346 --> 17:28.815
- SO, LOOKING BACK
AT YOUR BEHAVIOR AT OPEN HOUSES,

17:28.848 --> 17:30.483
DO YOU THINK
YOU EVER GO TOO FAR?

17:30.517 --> 17:32.719
- SURE. OF COURSE.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.621
THAT SAID, I MEAN--
- JUMPING IN THE POOL?

17:34.654 --> 17:36.256
- YEAH, THAT WAS
[bleep] RIDICULOUS.

17:36.289 --> 17:38.692
- YEAH.
I THINK THAT WAS OKAY.

17:38.725 --> 17:39.693
- THAT WAS BAD.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.227
- THIS SITUATION, THOUGH--

17:41.261 --> 17:43.697
EVERYONE IS LIKE, "OH, YOU PUT
THE POCKET SQUARE IN HIS MOUTH.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.598
OH, YOU PUT THE POCKET SQUARE
IN HIS MOUTH."

17:45.632 --> 17:48.435
AND EMILIA WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO,
LIKE, POINTED IT OUT BEFORE.

17:48.468 --> 17:50.236
LIKE, I WAS JUST SORT OF
STANDING THERE,

17:50.270 --> 17:51.604
AND YOU CAME OVER,
AND YOU WERE LIKE,

17:51.638 --> 17:54.107
"I'M GOING TO PUNCH
YOUR MOTHER[bleep] TEETH IN."

17:54.140 --> 17:55.342
- IT WASN'T LIKE THAT.
RYAN, NO.

17:55.375 --> 17:56.443
- "I AM GOING TO MAKE YOU
SWALLOW YOUR TEETH."

17:56.476 --> 17:57.844
- LET ME STOP YOU RIGHT THERE.

17:57.877 --> 17:59.379
- "I'M GOING TO COME AFTER YOU
WITH PHYSICAL VIOLENCE."

17:59.412 --> 18:01.781
- LISTEN TO ME.
- HERE WE GO.

18:01.815 --> 18:03.249
- IT'S TRUE.
- IT'S STARTING...

18:03.283 --> 18:04.718
- OKAY, BUT LET ME--
- ALREADY UNRAVELING.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.252
- OKAY, AND I NEED YOU
TO BE OPEN TO THIS IDEA

18:06.286 --> 18:07.587
BECAUSE THIS IS THE REALITY.

18:07.620 --> 18:10.523
YOUR INTENTIONS WERE NOT GOOD,
ALL RIGHT?

18:10.557 --> 18:12.025
YOU WERE NOT SAYING,
"JOHN, NICE TO MEET YOU.

18:12.025 --> 18:14.627
I THINK THIS IS
A LOVELY PARTY."

18:14.661 --> 18:17.030
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF "POCKET SQUARE GATE"?

18:17.063 --> 18:19.566
- MY QUESTION TO RYAN EXACTLY--

18:19.599 --> 18:21.768
WITH THE SWIMMING POOL,
HE JUMPED IN...

18:21.801 --> 18:23.470
- AH!

18:23.503 --> 18:26.339
- OH, MY GOD.
IS THIS REALLY HAPPENING?

18:26.373 --> 18:27.841
- SHE'S REALLY, REALLY, COLD.

18:27.874 --> 18:30.410
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU WOULD WANT

18:30.443 --> 18:32.846
TO PORTRAY YOURSELF LIKE THAT

18:32.879 --> 18:34.381
IN A PROFESSIONAL ENVIRONMENT,

18:34.414 --> 18:37.183
REGARDLESS OF, LIKE,
LUIS OR I GETTING ANGRY.

18:37.217 --> 18:39.252
LIKE, RIGHT IN THE MOMENT,
ALL THESE PEOPLE WATCHING,

18:39.285 --> 18:41.154
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THAT
TO YOUR OWN CAREER?

18:41.187 --> 18:42.489
THAT'S, YOU KNOW--

18:42.522 --> 18:44.624
- I DON'T THINK
IT'S NEGATIVELY AFFECTED ME.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.659
I SAVED A LIFE.

18:46.693 --> 18:49.229
- DID YOU SAVE A LIFE?
- I INITIATED A DEAL. YEAH.

18:49.262 --> 18:50.497
- YOU SAVED A LIFE IN THAT POOL?

18:50.530 --> 18:52.532
- A GIRL.
- WAS SHE DROWNING?

18:52.565 --> 18:54.567
- SHE WAS REALLY COLD.
- SHE WAS COLD.

18:54.601 --> 18:56.202
- I THOUGHT
YOU WERE TOUCHING HER.

18:56.236 --> 18:57.637
YOU WEREN'T REALLY SAVING
HER LIFE.

18:57.671 --> 18:59.739
- I WAS. I WAS WARMING HER UP
WITH MY BODY HEAT.

18:59.773 --> 19:01.207
- YEAH.
FOR THE RECORD.

19:01.241 --> 19:02.575
- COMING UP...

19:02.609 --> 19:03.810
YOU THINK HE'S INSINCERE?

19:03.843 --> 19:05.078
- I THINK HE DOESN'T KNOW

19:05.111 --> 19:06.346
WHY HE'S DOING THE THINGS
HE DOES.

19:06.379 --> 19:08.214
- I TAKE FREDRIK'S POINT
OF VIEW HERE.

19:08.248 --> 19:10.116
I TAKE HIS SIDE.
- WHY? BECAUSE IT'S BUSINESS?

19:10.150 --> 19:11.818
WAKE THE [bleep] UP.

19:18.558 --> 19:19.893
- WE ARE BACK

19:19.926 --> 19:22.562
WITH THE<i>MILLION DOLLAR LISTING</i>
<i>NEW YORK REUNION.</i>

19:22.595 --> 19:26.466
NOW, RYAN, YOU'RE NOT

19:26.499 --> 19:28.702
LUIS'S ONLY DUBIOUS FRIEND
THIS SEASON.

19:28.735 --> 19:31.304
WHEN IT COMES TO LUIS'S
RELATIONSHIP WITH FREDRIK,

19:31.338 --> 19:34.808
THERE WAS NO MAGIC
BETWEEN THEM.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.476
WATCH THIS.

19:36.509 --> 19:39.779
- I WAS LOOKING OVER LUIS' SALES
HERE AT DOUGLAS ELLIMAN,

19:39.813 --> 19:41.181
AND I THINK HE CAN DO BETTER

19:41.214 --> 19:42.916
IF HE WOULD JUST COME TO ME
FOR ADVICE.

19:42.949 --> 19:45.318
HE REMINDS ME OF ROBIN,
IF I WAS BATMAN.

19:45.352 --> 19:46.653
I WANT TO GET
MYSELF IN THERE.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.621
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
I WANT TO MOLD HIM

19:48.655 --> 19:49.756
AND BUILD
A LITTLE MINI FREDRIK.

19:49.789 --> 19:51.091
- HELLO.
- HI.

19:51.124 --> 19:53.326
- HOW ARE YOU, SIR?
- YOU'RE LATE.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.228
- FREDRIK ASKED ME
TO DROP BY HIS OFFICE.

19:55.261 --> 19:57.297
HE'S BEEN TRYING VERY HARD
TO BE A FRIEND.

19:57.330 --> 19:59.232
- LUIS, I'M YOUR FRIEND.
I MEAN, I WANT TO HEAR.

19:59.265 --> 20:01.368
IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME.

20:01.401 --> 20:03.103
- BUT I'M KIND OF TRAPPED
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW

20:03.136 --> 20:05.705
IF I CAN BE FRIENDS
WITH HIM YET.

20:05.739 --> 20:07.874
DON'T BE A STUPID [bleep] CHILD.
GIVE ME THAT GODDAMN CHECK.

20:07.907 --> 20:09.376
YOU'RE A [bleep] PIECE
OF [bleep].

20:09.409 --> 20:10.510
I SWEAR TO GOD, MAN,

20:10.543 --> 20:13.313
YOU DISGUSTING [bleep]
MOTHER[bleep].

20:13.346 --> 20:14.981
YOU'RE A [bleep] DISGRACE!

20:15.015 --> 20:17.317
BUT I ALSO CAN'T IGNORE HIM,
BECAUSE HE IS ONE

20:17.350 --> 20:19.419
OF THIS COMPANY'S
BIGGEST BROKERS.

20:19.452 --> 20:20.920
- YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S IN THIS BRAIN

20:20.954 --> 20:21.921
WHEN IT COMES TO REAL ESTATE?

20:21.955 --> 20:23.423
I WANT YOU TO DO REALLY WELL.

20:23.456 --> 20:25.191
WHY IS THAT SO HARD FOR YOU
TO UNDERSTAND?

20:25.225 --> 20:26.860
- I WOULD LIKE TO LEARN
THE ASPECTS OF NEW DEVELOPMENT.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.462
- HMM.

20:29.496 --> 20:31.297
WELL, I HAVE ONE THING.

20:31.331 --> 20:33.466
I WANT TO SHOW YOU
HOW A NEW DEVELOPER WORKS,

20:33.500 --> 20:34.567
START TO FINISH.

20:34.601 --> 20:37.003
- I REALLY, REALLY WANT
THE OPPORTUNITY

20:37.037 --> 20:38.638
TO WORK
ON A BIG NEW DEVELOPMENT.

20:38.672 --> 20:41.675
I'M READY TO WORK WITH
DEVELOPERS LIKE ZACH VELLA.

20:41.708 --> 20:43.710
- NICE TO MEET YOU, LUIS.
- LIKEWISE.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.478
- FREDRIK SAID
YOU'RE UP AND COMING

20:45.512 --> 20:47.447
AND THAT YOU'RE SORT
OF LOOKING

20:47.480 --> 20:49.349
TO BE A LITTLE "MINI FREDRIK."

20:49.382 --> 20:51.451
- WHEN WE MET AT YOUR OFFICE,

20:51.484 --> 20:52.852
YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU WANTED
TO HELP ME,

20:52.886 --> 20:54.421
AND I SAID
I WANTED NEW DEVELOPMENT.

20:54.454 --> 20:56.389
- YOU'RE NOT READY. YOU WANT ME
TO GIVE YOU ZACH VELLA?

20:56.423 --> 20:57.924
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

20:57.957 --> 20:59.225
- IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT YOU DO,
IT'S HOW YOU DO IT.

20:59.259 --> 21:00.493
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU.

21:00.527 --> 21:01.795
- YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO HELP ME.

21:01.828 --> 21:03.329
YOU WANT TO CONTROL ME.
- LOOK AT YOURSELF RIGHT NOW.

21:03.363 --> 21:04.497
LOOK AT YOURSELF
IN THE MIRROR.

21:04.531 --> 21:05.799
- "LOOK AT YOURSELF
IN THE MIRROR"?

21:05.832 --> 21:07.334
LOOK AT YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR.
- YEAH, I WILL.

21:07.367 --> 21:08.802
AND I'M GONNA SEE SOMEONE WHO'S
TRYING TO HELP SOMEONE ELSE.

21:08.835 --> 21:10.403
- YEAH, YOU'RE GONNA SEE
SOME [bleep] SELFISH BITCH.

21:10.437 --> 21:12.472
- OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.

21:12.505 --> 21:14.240
- [bleep] YOU.
PIECE OF [bleep].

21:14.274 --> 21:16.076
- THE PROBLEM WITH YOU,
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

21:16.076 --> 21:17.544
- YOU DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE,
MY FRIEND.

21:17.577 --> 21:20.113
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THAT'S
HOW YOU TREAT DEREK.

21:20.146 --> 21:21.715
IF THAT'S THE REASON
WHY YOU'RE EVEN WITH HIM,

21:21.748 --> 21:23.149
I FEEL BAD FOR HIM TOO.

21:23.183 --> 21:24.617
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!

21:24.651 --> 21:26.252
WE WERE GONNA START AND DO
THIS FREAKIN' THING TOGETHER.

21:26.286 --> 21:27.921
YOU WANT TO JUMP FROM HERE
UP TO HERE.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.756
GO JUMP.
I'M NOT GONNA BE YOUR PARTNER.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.691
I'M GONNA BE YOUR COMPETITOR.

21:31.725 --> 21:32.726
[bleep] YOU.

21:32.759 --> 21:34.394
- YOU WEAK PIECE OF [bleep].

21:34.427 --> 21:36.096
- THIS DOESN'T END HERE.

21:36.096 --> 21:40.367
IT'S ACTUALLY
JUST THE BEGINNING.

21:43.303 --> 21:45.271
- WERE YOU REALLY TRYING
TO HELP HIM?

21:45.305 --> 21:48.875
- YES, I WAS REALLY TRYING
TO HELP HIM.

21:48.908 --> 21:51.644
I THINK MY INTENTIONS
WERE ALWAYS PURE

21:51.678 --> 21:52.979
WHEN IT COMES TO HELPING HIM.

21:53.013 --> 21:55.248
I LOOK LIKE A FOOL
BECAUSE I WANT TO HELP SOMEONE

21:55.281 --> 21:56.383
WHO DOESN'T WANT TO GET HELP.

21:56.416 --> 21:57.684
SO WHY AM I EVEN TRYING
TO BEGIN WITH?

21:57.717 --> 21:59.219
AND I THINK, YOU KNOW,

21:59.252 --> 22:01.788
THAT'S WHY IT'S ALSO NOT SO FUN
FOR ME TO WATCH

22:01.821 --> 22:03.123
THE TWO OF THEM
BEING FRIENDS NOW,

22:03.156 --> 22:04.424
BECAUSE I THINK I'M THE ONE

22:04.457 --> 22:08.161
IN MY CRAZY REAL-ESTATE,
OBSESSIVE WAY,

22:08.194 --> 22:10.630
THAT'S MY WAY OF ASKING
FOR A FRIENDSHIP WITH LUIS,

22:10.663 --> 22:12.065
AND THAT WENT REALLY WRONG.

22:12.098 --> 22:14.401
- A FRIENDSHIP IS NOT ASKED.
FRIENDSHIP IS EARNED.

22:14.434 --> 22:18.638
- YES, I ADMIT THAT I DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF FRIENDS IN LIFE,

22:18.672 --> 22:20.206
ESPECIALLY NOT IN NEW YORK.

22:20.240 --> 22:21.775
SO, YES, I'M AT FAULT.

22:21.808 --> 22:23.176
- WHY DO YOU WANT TO HELP ME?

22:23.209 --> 22:25.412
TELL ME THE TRUTH.
IT'S NOT PROFITABLE FOR YOU.

22:25.445 --> 22:26.746
IT DOES NOTHING FOR YOUR LIFE.

22:26.780 --> 22:29.282
- WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE

22:29.315 --> 22:33.119
AND PROVE TO YOU THAT WHAT
I DID LAST SEASON WAS WRONG.

22:33.153 --> 22:35.288
NOW, WHEN IT COMES
TO NEW DEVELOPMENT,

22:35.321 --> 22:37.424
THERE'S SO MUCH THERE

22:37.457 --> 22:40.326
THAT'S NEVER EXPLAINED
ON THE SHOW.

22:40.360 --> 22:42.529
THAT'S WHY I MEAN, LIKE, YOU
WANT TO JUMP FROM HERE TO THERE.

22:42.562 --> 22:44.097
WE COULD HAVE DONE
THIS THING TOGETHER.

22:44.130 --> 22:45.865
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT A HOUSE IN BROOKLYN,

22:45.899 --> 22:50.103
I AM TALKING ABOUT MOVING UP
IN THE NEW DEVELOPMENT WORLD.

22:50.136 --> 22:52.105
- IT'S NOT WHAT YOU DO.
IT'S HOW YOU DO IT.

22:52.138 --> 22:55.342
MINI LUIS,
ROBIN FOR THE BATMAN,

22:55.375 --> 22:57.110
MINI FREDRIK,
AH, UP AND C--

22:57.143 --> 22:58.812
LIKE, LISTEN...

22:58.845 --> 23:00.146
- "UP AND COMING"
IS A COMPLIMENT.

23:00.180 --> 23:02.082
- I KNOW IT'S A COMPLIMENT,
BUT IT'S NOT--

23:02.115 --> 23:04.818
- "BATMAN AND ROBIN" TO ME
IS A COMPLIMENT.

23:04.851 --> 23:07.053
- YOU WERE OFFENDED
ABOUT THE "MINI FREDRIK" THING.

23:07.053 --> 23:09.489
- I'M NOT OFFENDED
ABOUT THOSE THINGS.

23:09.522 --> 23:11.424
- YOU SAT DOWN WITH HER.
YOU SAW THE FOOTAGE.

23:11.458 --> 23:13.093
AND I SAY,
"I REALLY, REALLY LIKE HIM."

23:13.126 --> 23:14.260
- NO, THAT'S TRUE.

23:14.294 --> 23:15.729
- I HAD THE BEST INTENTIONS
WITH HER,

23:15.762 --> 23:19.366
AND YOU JUST ALIENATED YOURSELF
FROM THE ENTIRE SITUATION.

23:19.399 --> 23:21.267
YOU KNOW, THE IRONY IS NOW
THAT I'M NEGOTIATING

23:21.301 --> 23:25.238
ON A 40-UNIT CONDOMINIUM SITE
IN BROOKLYN WITH HER,

23:25.271 --> 23:28.441
AND IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT
GONNA BE WITH YOU.

23:28.475 --> 23:31.244
- WELL...
OH, MY GOD, FREDRIK.

23:31.277 --> 23:33.847
- I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO YOU--
JUST LIKE WITH ZACH VELLA,

23:33.880 --> 23:36.316
IT STARTS WITH FIVE UNITS,
ONE UNIT, TWO UNITS,

23:36.349 --> 23:37.417
AND THEN YOU BUILD YOURSELF--

23:37.450 --> 23:40.887
- THESE ARE THINGS
THAT YOU NEVER TOLD ME.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.689
AND FIRST OF ALL, I NEVER
ASKED YOU FOR ANYTHING.

23:42.722 --> 23:44.124
YOU BEGGED ME TO HELP, RIGHT?

23:44.157 --> 23:47.193
- YOU'RE NEW AT THE COMPANY.
WE'RE SHARING THE SAME--

23:47.227 --> 23:49.696
- ARE YOU COMING DOWN ON HIM
FOR TRYING TO HELP YOU?

23:49.729 --> 23:51.097
- I'M NOT.
LISTEN...

23:51.131 --> 23:52.999
- YOU DON'T THINK HE WAS
ACTUALLY TRYING TO HELP YOU?

23:53.099 --> 23:54.367
- NO.
YOU KNOW WHAT HELP IS?

23:54.401 --> 23:56.302
IF I TELL YOU,
"I WANT TO HELP YOU,"

23:56.336 --> 23:57.404
AND YOU SAY "YOU KNOW WHAT?

23:57.437 --> 23:58.638
RIGHT NOW I DON'T NEED
YOUR HELP,"

23:58.672 --> 24:00.073
"I RESPECT THAT,
BUT I'M HERE IF YOU NEED ME."

24:00.106 --> 24:02.909
THAT IS HELP, NOT SOMEONE
THAT'S FORCING YOU TO DO--

24:02.942 --> 24:04.944
LISTEN--
- WHAT DID I FORCE YOU TO DO?

24:05.045 --> 24:06.546
- LISTEN, YOU CALL ME
INTO THIS OFFICE.

24:06.579 --> 24:08.548
YOU'RE LOOKING AT ALL MY DEALS,
AND YOU'RE TELLING ME,

24:08.581 --> 24:10.316
"'M HERE. I'M HERE."
AND YOU KEEP ON--

24:10.350 --> 24:12.352
LISTEN, I JUST--
I HAVE INSTINCTS, MAN.

24:12.385 --> 24:13.720
I HAVE INSTINCTS,

24:13.753 --> 24:15.221
AND I FEEL,
AND I KEEP ON TELLING YOU THIS

24:15.255 --> 24:16.890
THAT I THINK
THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO HELP ME

24:16.923 --> 24:19.159
IN ORDER TO FEEL BETTER
ABOUT YOURSELF.

24:19.192 --> 24:20.727
- HE'S TRYING TO MAKE HIMSELF
FEEL BETTER

24:20.760 --> 24:22.062
ABOUT WHAT HE DID LAST SEASON?

24:22.062 --> 24:23.329
- YOU'RE THE KIND OF PERSON
WHO OPENS A DOOR

24:23.363 --> 24:24.731
EXPECTING A THANK-YOU.

24:24.764 --> 24:26.800
- YES, THAT IS EXACTLY
WHY I WANT TO HELP YOU--

24:26.833 --> 24:27.901
ONE OF THE THINGS--

24:27.934 --> 24:31.338
AND THAT I ACTUALLY
WANT A FRIENDSHIP.

24:36.609 --> 24:39.679
- LISTEN, THE REASON
I'M FRIENDS WITH RYAN

24:39.713 --> 24:42.382
IS BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, HE DID
A LOT OF [bleep]-UP THINGS.

24:42.415 --> 24:43.917
IN FACT, NOT EVEN CLOSE
TO ANYTHING YOU'VE DONE--

24:43.950 --> 24:44.951
TERRIBLE, MORE.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.753
- AGREED.
- BUT, YOU KNOW...

24:46.786 --> 24:49.622
HE DID SOMETHING, PROVED
HIMSELF, EARNED MY RESPECT,

24:49.656 --> 24:51.591
AND THEN ADMITTED TO ME
THAT "I [bleep] UP,"

24:51.624 --> 24:52.859
AND THAT IS, TO ME--

24:52.892 --> 24:55.462
- OKAY, I BUY THAT.
FAST FORWARD--

24:55.495 --> 24:59.099
YOU RUN OFF SAYING THE "F" WORD
AND CALLING ME NAMES

24:59.099 --> 25:00.633
OUT ON THE STREET
IN PARK SLOPE.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.035
I CALL YOU 100 TIMES.

25:02.035 --> 25:04.037
- WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS.
- I TRY TO APOLOGIZE

25:04.070 --> 25:05.572
FOR SOMETHING
I DIDN'T EVEN THINK I DID,

25:05.605 --> 25:07.507
BUT YOU DIDN'T TAKE
MY CALLS,

25:07.540 --> 25:11.144
AND I STILL COME
TO YOUR 75 WALL PARTY

25:11.177 --> 25:12.312
TO TRY TO HUG IT OUT,

25:12.345 --> 25:14.881
TRY TO GET SOME SORT
OF, LIKE, CLOSURE.

25:14.914 --> 25:16.483
- IT'S JUST, YOU CANNOT TAKE--

25:16.516 --> 25:18.284
YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY HAVE
TO SEE

25:18.318 --> 25:20.086
WHERE IT'S COMING FROM, FREDRIK.

25:20.120 --> 25:22.956
- YOU THINK HE'S INSINCERE.
- YEAH.

25:23.056 --> 25:24.624
- WELL, THE ESSENCE IS
YOU DON'T WANT ANY HELP.

25:24.657 --> 25:25.692
I'M NOT GONNA HELP YOU.

25:25.725 --> 25:27.060
YOU TWO ARE FRIENDS, AND--

25:27.093 --> 25:29.662
- LISTEN, YOU'RE TALKING
LIKE A FIVE-YEAR-OLD, FREDRIK.

25:29.696 --> 25:31.965
- NO, BECAUSE I'M THE ONE
WHO'S TRYING TO,

25:32.065 --> 25:33.066
LIKE, DO SOMETHING WITH YOU.

25:33.066 --> 25:34.267
YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T WANT IT.

25:34.300 --> 25:36.436
- DID YOU THINK
THAT HIS OFFER

25:36.469 --> 25:39.339
OF THIS WOMAN
IN BROOKLYN'S PROJECT

25:39.372 --> 25:40.940
WAS TOO SMALL FOR YOU?
- NO.

25:40.974 --> 25:42.542
- OR DID YOU WANT
A ZACH VELLA SIZE?

25:42.575 --> 25:43.910
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

25:43.943 --> 25:46.379
IT'S NOT ABOUT
THE SIZE OF THE PROJECT.

25:46.413 --> 25:48.648
- WELL, THAT'S WHAT YOU
SAID TO HER AND IN THE--

25:48.682 --> 25:49.783
- YOU'RE BEING
TOO SIMPLE-MINDED.

25:49.816 --> 25:50.917
IT'S NOT ABOUT
THE SIZE OF THE PROJECT.

25:50.950 --> 25:52.452
IT'S NOT ABOUT--

25:52.485 --> 25:54.220
IT'S ABOUT--LISTEN...
- WHAT IS IT ABOUT?

25:54.254 --> 25:56.289
- YOU HELPED ME.
YOU HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH ME.

25:56.322 --> 25:57.524
WE TALK ABOUT NEW DEVELOPMENT.

25:57.557 --> 25:58.625
YOU SAID,
"I HAVE THIS DEVELOPER

25:58.658 --> 25:59.793
WHO'S BUILDING
NEW DEVELOPMENTS--"

25:59.826 --> 26:01.127
- SHE IS. SHE HAS IN THE PAST.
SHE WILL AGAIN.

26:01.161 --> 26:03.530
- WHEN I ASK HER WHAT KIND
OF PROJECT--

26:03.563 --> 26:04.864
LISTEN TO ME.
WHEN I ASK HER--

26:04.898 --> 26:06.299
- YOU LOST MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

26:06.332 --> 26:09.436
IN COMMISSION AND
AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO 40 UNITS.

26:09.469 --> 26:11.171
THAT'S WHAT YOU DON'T SEE.

26:11.204 --> 26:12.772
- WHEN I SAT DOWN WITH HER,
I ASKED HER,

26:12.806 --> 26:14.541
"I'M VERY EXCITED TO SEE
WHAT THIS NEW DEVELOPMENTS

26:14.574 --> 26:15.542
THAT YOU HAVE ARE ALL ABOUT."

26:15.575 --> 26:16.876
"RIGHT NOW I HAVE NOTHING.

26:16.910 --> 26:19.145
YOU KNOW, FREDRIK
IS SELLING THIS HOUSE."

26:19.179 --> 26:21.047
- THAT'S HOW DEVELOPERS TALK.
WHY WOULD SHE, LIKE, THROW--

26:21.047 --> 26:22.882
IT'S THE FIRST TIME
SHE'S MEETING YOU.

26:22.916 --> 26:25.885
YOU WANT IT ON A SILVER PLATE.

26:25.919 --> 26:27.554
- I DON'T WANT IT ON A SILVER--

26:27.587 --> 26:30.490
FREDRIK, EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE,
I'VE EARNED IN THIS LIFE.

26:30.523 --> 26:32.225
THERE'S NOTHING THAT
I WANT ON A SILVER PLATTER.

26:32.258 --> 26:33.493
THAT'S WHY I NEVER
ASK YOU FOR HELP.

26:33.526 --> 26:35.261
LISTEN,
I AM CONSTANTLY LEARNING,

26:35.295 --> 26:37.564
AND I WILL LEARN FROM EACH
PERSON THAT PUTS IN FRONT OF ME,

26:37.597 --> 26:39.399
BUT NOT SOMEONE
THAT IS DOING IT

26:39.432 --> 26:41.067
FOR THE SAKE OF FELLING GREAT
ABOUT HIMSELF.

26:41.101 --> 26:42.168
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING--

26:42.202 --> 26:43.570
I'M A PERSON,
AND I CAME TO UNDERSTAND

26:43.603 --> 26:44.938
WHO I'VE BECOME
AND WHO I AM TODAY.

26:44.971 --> 26:47.407
AND I HAVE GREAT PERSONALITY,
AND I'M GOING SOMEWHERE.

26:47.440 --> 26:49.776
AND YOU'RE SENSING THAT, AND
YOU WANT TO BE A PART OF THAT.

26:49.809 --> 26:51.277
NOW, YOU'RE TRYING TO FORCE
THIS RELATIONSHIP

26:51.311 --> 26:52.579
BY OFFERING ME HELP
AND TELLING ME,

26:52.612 --> 26:54.247
"LISTEN, I CAN DO THIS FOR YOU,
I CAN DO THAT FOR YOU.

26:54.280 --> 26:55.482
I CAN DO THAT FOR YOU."

26:55.515 --> 26:57.317
BUT, LISTEN,
I'M ENJOYING BUILDING MYSELF.

26:57.350 --> 26:59.085
I WILL BECOME YOUR BEST FRIEND

26:59.085 --> 27:00.520
OUTSIDE OF BUSINESS
IF IT'S EARNED.

27:00.553 --> 27:02.022
BUT I FEEL
THAT YOU'RE THE KIND OF PERSON

27:02.022 --> 27:03.490
THAT OPENS A DOOR
EXPECTING A THANK-YOU,

27:03.523 --> 27:07.293
AS OPPOSED TO OPENING THE DOOR
JUST BY BEING A GENTLEMAN.

27:07.327 --> 27:09.029
I CAN SENSE IT, MAN.

27:09.062 --> 27:11.031
YOU KNOW, YOU TELL ME YOU CALL
ME AND CALL ME AND CALL ME,

27:11.031 --> 27:12.265
BUT IT'S THAT THING THAT YOU--

27:12.298 --> 27:14.300
IT'S FOR YOU.
YOU'RE DOING THIS FOR YOU.

27:14.334 --> 27:17.370
- NO, I WAS DOING IT FOR YOU.

27:17.404 --> 27:18.705
- COMING UP...

27:18.738 --> 27:21.374
- I WOULD MUCH RATHER BE
ON HIS GOOD SIDE

27:21.408 --> 27:22.909
THAN BE ON HIS BAD SIDE.

27:22.942 --> 27:24.544
- BECAUSE YOU BEND OVER
FOR BUSINESS?

27:24.577 --> 27:26.046
WHERE'S YOUR INTEGRITY, MAN?

27:26.046 --> 27:28.815
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. I'M NOT
BENDING OVER FOR ANYBODY.

27:36.122 --> 27:37.924
- [slurping]

27:37.957 --> 27:41.094
- [slurps, gulps]

27:43.797 --> 27:45.498
- [slurps]

27:45.532 --> 27:47.133
- DO WE GET A BATHROOM BREAK
OR ANYTHING?

27:47.167 --> 27:48.301
- WHAT?

27:48.335 --> 27:49.803
- DO WE GET A BATHROOM--
NO, WE DON'T?

27:49.836 --> 27:51.071
- YEAH, YOU CAN GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

27:51.104 --> 27:52.072
- SHE SAID 15 SECONDS.

27:52.105 --> 27:53.239
- OH, JUST WAIT A SECOND.

27:53.273 --> 27:54.407
- SHOULD I RUN NOW?
NO?

27:54.441 --> 27:55.809
- SHOULD YOU WHAT?

27:55.842 --> 27:57.377
- PEE.
I HAVE TO PEE.

27:57.410 --> 27:59.245
- ANDY, WHEN'S THE NEXT BREAK?
I NEED TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.

27:59.279 --> 28:00.547
- YOU HAVE TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM?

28:00.580 --> 28:02.315
- LISTEN, IT'S NOT LIKE
I WANT TO.

28:02.349 --> 28:03.383
LET ME KNOW WHEN--
I CAN HOLD ON A LITTLE BIT.

28:03.416 --> 28:05.685
- [whispering]
GOD, I HAVE TO PEE.

28:05.719 --> 28:07.454
- CAN I GO NOW?
- I THINK YOU CAN, YEAH.

28:07.487 --> 28:08.722
- OH.

28:08.755 --> 28:10.657
- [slurps]

28:10.690 --> 28:12.592
I'M GONNA PEE
WHEN RYAN COMES BACK.

28:12.625 --> 28:13.760
- GO AHEAD.

28:13.793 --> 28:16.262
- ANDY, WHENEVER
YOU CAN SAVE ME, I NEED TO GO.

28:16.296 --> 28:17.630
- GO.
- YEAH?

28:20.333 --> 28:22.335
[sighs]

28:22.369 --> 28:25.538
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I FEEL LIKE A NEW MAN.

28:25.572 --> 28:26.706
- CAN I PEE?

28:26.740 --> 28:29.743
- YEAH, GO.
- I'M GOING TOO.

28:35.648 --> 28:37.050
- WELCOME BACK

28:37.050 --> 28:39.285
TO THE<i>MILLION DOLLAR LISTING</i>
<i>NEW YORK REUNION.</i>

28:39.319 --> 28:41.955
NOW, LUIS, LET ME
ASK YOU A QUESTION.

28:42.055 --> 28:44.524
AS WE SIT HERE NOW
AND YOU KNOW

28:44.557 --> 28:47.160
THAT THIS WOMAN THAT HE TRIED
TO PAIR YOU WITH

28:47.193 --> 28:49.195
DID HAVE ALL THE STUFF
COMING UP

28:49.229 --> 28:52.732
AND IS NOW DOING
THIS 40-UNIT DEVELOPMENT,

28:52.766 --> 28:54.601
DO YOU NOW SECOND-GUESS

28:54.634 --> 28:57.170
THAT MAYBE HE WAS TRYING
TO HELP YOU?

28:57.203 --> 29:01.274
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T DOUBT THE CREDIBILITY

29:01.307 --> 29:03.143
AND THE LEGITIMACY
OF THAT CLIENT.

29:03.176 --> 29:04.411
- RIGHT.

29:04.444 --> 29:07.280
- I MAY HAVE LOST, MONEY-WISE,
ON A NEW PROJECT,

29:07.313 --> 29:09.182
BUT LIFE IS TOO SHORT TO WORK
WITH UNREASONABLE PEOPLE

29:09.215 --> 29:11.251
AND PEOPLE THAT I FEEL
ARE NOT BEING GENUINE TO ME.

29:11.284 --> 29:13.653
AND I'LL TELL YOU THE TRUTH--
MAYBE HE WAS HELPING ME.

29:13.687 --> 29:15.121
BUT IF HE HELPS ME
FOR HIS SAKE

29:15.155 --> 29:16.423
AND HE TELLS ME THAT,
I'M GOOD WITH THAT.

29:16.456 --> 29:18.024
IF HE HELPS ME FOR MY SAKE
AND HE TELLS ME THAT,

29:18.058 --> 29:19.159
I'M GOOD WITH THAT.

29:19.192 --> 29:20.627
WHEN SOMETHING IS NOT REAL,

29:20.660 --> 29:23.663
I DON'T GIVE A [bleep]
HOW MUCH MONEY WILL I MAKE.

29:23.697 --> 29:26.700
I DON'T WANT TO BE
A PART OF THAT.

29:26.733 --> 29:30.136
- I'M DYING TO KNOW WHAT RYAN'S
POINT OF VIEW ON THIS IS.

29:30.170 --> 29:31.671
- YOU KNOW, IT'S...

29:31.705 --> 29:33.873
I GOT TO SAY, MAN, LIKE,

29:33.907 --> 29:37.477
I TAKE FREDRIK'S
POINT OF VIEW HERE.

29:37.510 --> 29:39.412
I MEAN, I TAKE HIS SIDE
BECAUSE IT IS--

29:39.446 --> 29:41.247
YOU KNOW, IT IS VERY HARD
TO FIND ANYONE

29:41.281 --> 29:42.482
WHO IS GENUINE
IN THIS BUSINESS.

29:42.515 --> 29:45.118
LIKE, IF I WERE TO WALK
INTO WORK EVERY SINGLE DAY

29:45.151 --> 29:46.653
AND SAY, "I'M ONLY GOING
TO WORK WITH GENUINE PEOPLE,"

29:46.686 --> 29:48.121
I'D PROBABLY MAKE $10.

29:48.154 --> 29:49.889
THIS IS NEW YORK CITY.

29:49.923 --> 29:51.124
THIS IS REAL ESTATE,
ALL RIGHT?

29:51.157 --> 29:52.959
GRANDMOTHERS ARE GONNA LIE
TO YOUR FACE.

29:53.059 --> 29:54.861
THAT'S THE WAY
THIS BUSINESS WORKS.

29:54.894 --> 29:57.297
YOU SEE AN OPPORTUNITY,
YOU GO FOR IT, RIGHT?

29:57.330 --> 29:58.565
YOU WANT TO COME TO NEW YORK,

29:58.598 --> 30:00.333
YOU JUMP ON THE [bleep] BOAT,
AND YOU COME HERE.

30:00.367 --> 30:01.835
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU DID.
- IT WASN'T A BOAT.

30:01.868 --> 30:02.936
- WHAT WAS IT?
WAS IT A RAFT?

30:02.969 --> 30:04.204
- IT WAS A PLANE.
- AIRPLANE.

30:04.237 --> 30:06.406
[laughing]
- JESUS [bleep]--

30:06.439 --> 30:08.308
- SORRY.
THAT'S NOT WHAT I--

30:08.341 --> 30:09.809
BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN, RIGHT?

30:09.843 --> 30:10.977
- GO ON.
- YES.

30:11.011 --> 30:12.412
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.
KEEP GOING.

30:12.445 --> 30:14.414
- YOU TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY,
AND SO, I MEAN, LISTEN,

30:14.447 --> 30:16.349
SO THE OPPORTUNITY
FOR SOMEONE TO COME IN AND SAY--

30:16.383 --> 30:17.984
I MEAN, EVEN FOR ME,
IF FREDRIK SAID,

30:18.018 --> 30:19.352
"HEY, DO YOU WANT TO COME
AND LIST A TOWNHOUSE

30:19.386 --> 30:20.387
"WITH ME IN BROOKLYN?

30:20.420 --> 30:21.488
IT'S 4 1/2 MILLION BUCKS."

30:21.521 --> 30:24.224
I'D SAY,
"OKAY, 3% IS $120,000.

30:24.257 --> 30:25.291
THAT SOUNDS GREAT."

30:25.325 --> 30:26.326
THIS WOMAN--
I'D LOOK HER UP,

30:26.359 --> 30:27.560
SEE THAT SHE WAS
A DEVELOPER BEFORE,

30:27.594 --> 30:29.562
SEE THAT FREDRIK
DOES NOT WASTE HIS TIME

30:29.596 --> 30:31.398
WITH CLIENTS, RIGHT?

30:31.431 --> 30:33.566
FOR WHATEVER HIS REASON MAY BE,
THEN, OKAY.

30:33.600 --> 30:36.770
I WOULD MUCH RATHER BE
ON HIS GOOD SIDE

30:36.803 --> 30:38.371
THAN BE ON HIS BAD SIDE

30:38.405 --> 30:39.973
AND THAT'S FOR EVERYBODY
IN THE BUSINESS.

30:40.006 --> 30:41.908
- WHY?
BECAUSE IT'S BUSINESS?

30:41.941 --> 30:43.877
BECAUSE YOU BEND OVER
FOR BUSINESS?

30:43.910 --> 30:45.645
WHERE'S YOUR INTEGRITY, MAN?

30:45.679 --> 30:48.648
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
[stammers]

30:48.682 --> 30:50.483
I'M NOT BENDING OVER
FOR ANYBODY.

30:50.517 --> 30:52.852
HE'S NOT SAYING "HEY, I'VE GOT
THIS BULL[bleep] LISTING

30:52.886 --> 30:55.055
"OUT IN BROOKLYN,
COME TAKE IT FROM ME.

30:55.088 --> 30:57.023
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
5% OF IT."

30:57.057 --> 30:58.992
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE AGREEMENT
YOU GUYS MADE OF IT,

30:59.025 --> 31:01.061
BUT I HONESTLY FEEL THAT--

31:01.061 --> 31:02.662
YOU KNOW,
THAT IT WAS A DEAL LOST.

31:02.696 --> 31:05.465
- IT WAS AN INTRODUCTION
TO A CLIENT

31:05.498 --> 31:11.071
THAT YOU TURNING HER DOWN,
MAKING A FOOL OUT OF BOTH OF US,

31:11.104 --> 31:12.972
AND THEN GOING
COMPLETELY BANANAS

31:13.073 --> 31:14.674
AND SWEARING ON THE STREET.

31:14.708 --> 31:17.744
IT JUST SAYS SOMETHING
ABOUT YOUR INABILITY

31:17.777 --> 31:20.447
OF LEARNING, REALLY.

31:20.480 --> 31:23.383
- DO YOU THINK FREDRIK IS
A GOOD FRIEND TO LUIS

31:23.416 --> 31:25.719
OR HAS THE BEST INTENSIONS?

31:25.752 --> 31:27.787
- YOU KNOW, I'M NOT
INSIDE FREDRIK'S HEAD,

31:27.821 --> 31:29.189
SO I DON'T KNOW.

31:29.222 --> 31:31.691
I DON'T KNOW HOW GOOD
OF FRIENDS THEY ARE.

31:31.725 --> 31:33.593
BUT AGAIN,
THIS IS REAL ESTATE.

31:33.626 --> 31:34.928
WE'RE NOT MAKING CUPCAKES.
- YEAH.

31:34.961 --> 31:37.297
- LIKE, WE ARE DOING
BIG DEALS,

31:37.330 --> 31:38.631
AND THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY
ON THE TABLE.

31:38.665 --> 31:39.933
THERE'S A LOT
OF PERSONALITIES.

31:39.966 --> 31:43.670
THERE'S 35,000 REAL-ESTATE
AGENTS IN THE CITY.

31:43.703 --> 31:45.138
WE ARE THREE OF THEM.

31:45.171 --> 31:48.208
IF ONE OF THEM
WHO DOES A LOT OF BUSINESS

31:48.241 --> 31:51.111
COMES AND SAYS, "HEY, YOU WANT
TO WORK TOGETHER ON ONE DEAL?

31:51.111 --> 31:52.645
"COULD POSSIBLY TURN
INTO A BUNCH MORE.

31:52.679 --> 31:54.347
COULDN'T NOT.
I DON'T KNOW."

31:54.381 --> 31:55.982
IT'S A HALF AN HOUR
OUT OF YOUR LIFE

31:56.016 --> 31:57.283
TO DO A MEETING, RIGHT?

31:57.317 --> 32:00.086
I'D WALK IN THERE
WITH A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE,

32:00.120 --> 32:01.788
THE BEST PITCH BOOK
I COULD POSSIBLY--

32:01.821 --> 32:03.289
- BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WAS SAID.

32:03.323 --> 32:05.825
- I GET THAT, BUT I DO SEE
THAT, YOU KNOW, IN THAT SCENE,

32:05.859 --> 32:07.761
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER
HE CALLED YOU ROBIN OR WHATEVER,

32:07.794 --> 32:08.895
YOU SAID, "LISTEN."

32:08.928 --> 32:10.163
YOU SAID, "I WANT TO DO
NEW DEVELOPMENT."

32:10.196 --> 32:11.331
AND HE SAID, "OKAY,
WELL, I DO HAVE SOMETHING."

32:11.364 --> 32:12.665
"IT'S A WOMAN
WITH A TOWNHOUSE,

32:12.699 --> 32:14.200
"BUT, I MEAN,
SHE IS A DEVELOPER.

32:14.234 --> 32:15.535
YOU SHOULD COME AND MEET HER."

32:15.568 --> 32:18.071
AND I THINK YOU WERE JUST
A LITTLE BIT TOO PRIDEFUL,

32:18.071 --> 32:19.339
AND THAT'S OKAY,

32:19.372 --> 32:21.074
'CAUSE I'VE BEEN
IN THAT SITUATION, TOO, BEFORE.

32:21.107 --> 32:22.475
- WHAT'S WRONG
WITH BEING ROBIN?

32:22.509 --> 32:24.811
- NO, IT'S NOTHING.
LISTEN, GUYS, YOU'RE JUST--

32:24.844 --> 32:26.513
IT'S MUCH MORE
THAN JUST THE ROBIN

32:26.546 --> 32:28.815
AND IT'S MUCH MORE THAN JUST--
- NO, THIS IS WHAT IT IS.

32:28.848 --> 32:31.551
YOU ARE THE PROUDEST PERSON
I'VE EVER MET.

32:31.584 --> 32:33.987
BUT, DUDE, YOU GOT
TO OPEN YOURSELF

32:34.087 --> 32:37.157
SOMEWHERE, SOMEHOW
TO GET TO THE TOP.

32:37.190 --> 32:38.591
IF YOU'RE HAPPY
BEING WHERE YOU ARE--

32:38.625 --> 32:41.761
AND I DON'T MEAN IT
IN A DISRESPECTFUL WAY AT ALL.

32:41.795 --> 32:43.463
BUT IF YOU WANT TO GET
TO THE VERY TOP--

32:43.496 --> 32:45.899
I DIDN'T GET
TO THE TOP BY MYSELF.

32:45.932 --> 32:47.334
I HAD TO WORK FOR FREE.

32:47.367 --> 32:48.968
MY FIRST PROJECT
ON 28TH AND 8TH,

32:49.002 --> 32:50.670
I WORKED BASICALLY FOR FREE.
I SAT IN A ROOM--

32:50.704 --> 32:52.105
- YOU'RE GETTING IT
ALL WRONG, MAN.

32:52.105 --> 32:54.007
- 52 UNITS AND I--
- HOW'S HE GETTING IT WRONG?

32:54.107 --> 32:55.675
- ANYWAY, WHATEVER.
OKAY. I GET IT ALL WRONG.

32:55.709 --> 32:57.377
- DOES YOUR PRIDE
GET IN THE WAY?

32:57.410 --> 32:58.978
DOES YOUR ANGER GET IN THE WAY?
- NO.

32:59.012 --> 33:01.147
LISTEN, ANGER PROBABLY,
MOST LIKELY WILL GET IN MY WAY

33:01.181 --> 33:02.382
'CAUSE I'M ANGRY GUY SOMETIMES.

33:02.415 --> 33:04.784
- YES.
- BUT LISTEN, IT'S NOT ABOUT--

33:04.818 --> 33:06.319
I LEARNED FROM--

33:06.353 --> 33:08.922
LISTEN, MICHAEL AND
HOWARD LORBER, STEVE WICK--

33:08.955 --> 33:10.190
I LOOK UP TO THESE PEOPLE.

33:10.223 --> 33:11.758
THEY OFFER ME THINGS,
I TAKE THEM.

33:11.791 --> 33:14.461
WHY WOULD I NOT LEARN FROM YOU?
- OKAY, GOOD.

33:14.494 --> 33:16.329
SO TAKE THEIR PROJECTS,
AND I'LL SEE YOU OUT THERE.

33:16.363 --> 33:17.664
- I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT PROJECTS.

33:17.697 --> 33:18.865
WAKE THE [bleep] UP.

33:18.898 --> 33:21.735
WHY WOULD I NOT LEARN
FROM SOMEONE LIKE YOU?

33:21.768 --> 33:24.137
I WOULD KILL TO LEARN
WHAT YOU KNOW.

33:24.170 --> 33:25.572
- YOU JUST DIDN'T FEEL
LIKE HE WAS BEING SINCERE.

33:25.605 --> 33:26.940
- YES.

33:26.973 --> 33:29.075
LISTEN, MAN,
I WANT TO LEARN, MAN,

33:29.075 --> 33:30.577
AND I'M CONSTANTLY DOING THAT.

33:30.610 --> 33:32.512
BUT IF I LEARNING
FROM SOMEONE THAT I FEEL

33:32.545 --> 33:33.913
IS NOT BEING A GENTLEMAN,

33:33.947 --> 33:35.715
I DON'T WANT TO POISON MYSELF
WITH THINGS LIKE THAT.

33:35.749 --> 33:37.517
- SO WHERE DO THE TWO
OF YOU GO FROM HERE?

33:37.550 --> 33:39.519
- I DON'T KNOW.
ASK HIM.

33:39.552 --> 33:41.588
I CAME TO 75 WALL

33:41.621 --> 33:45.792
WITH SOME SORT OF HOPE
TO RESOLVE,

33:45.825 --> 33:47.894
AND I WAS CALLED
A WEAK [bleep] AND...

33:47.927 --> 33:50.096
- SEE, BUT YOU'RE...
- BITCH.

33:50.096 --> 33:52.465
- FORGET ABOUT THE NAMES, MAN.

33:52.499 --> 33:54.134
- I DON'T SHARE
YOUR LIFE PHILOSOPHY.

33:54.167 --> 33:55.902
YOU LOOK AT THE WORLD
VERY DIFFERENT THAN I DO--

33:55.935 --> 33:58.438
MAYBE BECAUSE I'M FROM SWEDEN,
YOU'RE FROM PUERTO RICO.

33:58.471 --> 33:59.739
I DON'T KNOW.

33:59.773 --> 34:01.207
I JUST SEE IT
THE WAY THAT I SEE.

34:01.241 --> 34:02.542
I HAD HONEST ATTEMPT.

34:02.575 --> 34:05.478
I'M NOT PERFECT,
AND SOMETIMES, YES,

34:05.512 --> 34:07.313
I CAN SOUND CONDESCENDING,

34:07.347 --> 34:10.216
BUT MY INTENTIONS
ARE PURE, SO...

34:10.250 --> 34:12.252
- RYAN--
- WHATEVER.

34:12.285 --> 34:16.156
- RYAN, WHERE DO YOU AND FREDRIK
GO FROM HERE?

34:16.189 --> 34:18.625
- I CAN ANSWER THAT.
- OKAY.

34:18.658 --> 34:21.528
- I'M LOOKING FORWARD

34:21.561 --> 34:24.564
TO GETTING TO KNOW HIM MORE.

34:24.597 --> 34:29.369
AND I FEEL LIKE THIS GAVE ME
A MUCH BETTER UNDERSTANDING

34:29.402 --> 34:31.404
OF HIM AND EMILIA.

34:31.438 --> 34:34.074
- WHAT, TONIGHT?
- YEAH, TONIGHT.

34:34.074 --> 34:36.109
AND I'M OPTIMISTIC.

34:36.142 --> 34:38.078
- CAN I SAY ONE THING?

34:38.078 --> 34:41.915
I REALLY WANT TO BE OPEN
TO THE IDEA THAT I WAS WRONG.

34:41.948 --> 34:46.319
I STILL BELIEVE, TRULY,
THAT I'M RIGHT, OKAY?

34:46.353 --> 34:48.455
BUT I WANT TO BE OPEN
TO THE IDEA THAT I WAS WRONG,

34:48.488 --> 34:49.923
AND IF IN THE FUTURE
I GET TO UNDERSTAND THAT I WAS,

34:49.956 --> 34:51.758
LOOK BACK TO IT
AND APOLOGIZE.

34:51.791 --> 34:54.494
- DO YOU WANT TO WORK
ON A 40-UNIT BUILDING WITH ME?

34:54.527 --> 34:56.363
- HE JUST FOUND OUT, SO NOW
HE'S KIND OF LIKE, "WAIT."

34:56.396 --> 34:58.631
- LISTEN, IT'S NOT.
IT'S NOT.

34:58.665 --> 35:02.602
BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD REVISIT
THE REASON WHY YOU DO THINGS.

35:02.635 --> 35:05.171
- RYAN, ANYTHING ELSE
YOU WANT TO SAY?

35:05.205 --> 35:09.075
- YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALL GONNA HAVE
OUR DISAGREEMENTS.

35:09.109 --> 35:11.277
THIS IS REAL ESTATE
IN NEW YORK CITY.

35:11.311 --> 35:12.679
THIS IS A TOUGH BUSINESS.

35:12.712 --> 35:14.381
WE HAVE TO WAKE UP
EVERY SINGLE DAY

35:14.414 --> 35:16.850
AND, LIKE, FIGHT
JUST TO FIGURE OUT

35:16.883 --> 35:19.786
HOW WE'RE GOING TO MAKE
ANYTHING HAPPEN THAT DAY.

35:19.819 --> 35:22.555
AND I THINK YOU HAVE
TO USE OTHER PEOPLE,

35:22.589 --> 35:24.491
AND YOU'RE GONNA MAKE MISTAKES,
YOU'RE GONNA BE ANGRY.

35:24.524 --> 35:26.459
I'M GONNA PISS YOU OFF.
I'M GONNA PISS YOU OFF.

35:26.493 --> 35:28.528
BUT THEN THE TIME'S GONNA COME
BACK AROUND WHERE WE GOT TO SAY,

35:28.561 --> 35:29.929
"YOU KNOW WHAT?

35:29.963 --> 35:31.331
"I'M GOING TO NEED YOU
TO GET THIS DEAL DONE HERE,

35:31.364 --> 35:32.632
"AND I'M GOING TO NEED YOU

35:32.665 --> 35:34.567
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO DO
THIS TOGETHER,"

35:34.601 --> 35:36.670
AND YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING
TO MAKE AMENDS

35:36.703 --> 35:38.838
AND MAKE THOSE CHANGES
AND NOT HOLD GRUDGES.

35:38.872 --> 35:40.073
IT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU HAVE TO, LIKE,

35:40.073 --> 35:41.541
HAVE SLUMBER PARTIES
ON SATURDAY NIGHT

35:41.574 --> 35:43.943
AND WATCH SNICK, RIGHT?
- [laughs]

35:43.977 --> 35:47.580
- WELL, ONCE AGAIN,
RYAN, FREDRIK, AND LUIS,

35:47.614 --> 35:50.583
YOU HAD YOUR SHARE
OF CRAZY CLIENT ENCOUNTERS.

35:50.617 --> 35:51.584
WE'RE GONNA TAKE A LOOK

35:51.618 --> 35:53.553
AT THE CRAZIEST MOMENTS
FROM THE SEASON.

35:53.586 --> 35:55.088
WATCH.

35:55.088 --> 35:57.524
- YOU'VE GOT TO BRING ME
SOMETHING.

35:57.557 --> 35:59.092
- JOE, I'M BRINGING YOU
THE BEST.

35:59.125 --> 36:00.360
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
I'VE GONE THROUGH WITH THEM.

36:00.393 --> 36:02.529
NO OTHER BROKER CAN GET
THIS DONE FOR YOU.

36:02.562 --> 36:04.197
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
HANG ON, HANG ON, HANG ON.

36:04.230 --> 36:06.599
- YOU LISTEN TO ME NOW.
LISTEN TO ME!

36:06.633 --> 36:07.834
- NO, NO.
NOW, REMEMBER WHEN WE FIRST--

36:07.867 --> 36:09.035
- THIS IS YOUR PROBLEM.

36:09.035 --> 36:10.303
YOU DON'T LISTEN
TO THE PROFESSIONAL HERE.

36:10.337 --> 36:11.404
- PROFESSIONAL?

36:11.438 --> 36:13.073
- YES.
- OKAY, WHERE'S MY ASKING PRICE?

36:13.106 --> 36:15.041
- FORGET THE ASKING PRICE.
- WELL, NO.

36:15.041 --> 36:16.876
- THE ASKING PRICE WAS
BEFORE THE SCAFFOLDING.

36:16.910 --> 36:18.611
- YOU CAN'T BLAME IT ON ME...
- LISTEN TO ME.

36:18.645 --> 36:19.879
LISTEN TO ME.
- BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T DO--

36:19.913 --> 36:23.049
COME ON, MAN.
DO SOMETHING.

36:23.049 --> 36:24.451
- I'M HAPPY YOU CAME.

36:24.484 --> 36:25.885
I WAS GOING TO CALL A MEETING
FOR TOMORROW WITH YOU ANYWAY.

36:25.919 --> 36:27.654
- OKAY.
- THIS IS GOING TO SHOCK YOU.

36:27.687 --> 36:29.689
I FOUND A BUYER
FOR 11.5 MILLION.

36:29.723 --> 36:31.224
- I GOT TO THINK QUICK,
I GOT TO THINK QUICK,

36:31.257 --> 36:33.159
BECAUSE I'VE PUT TOO MUCH
TIME AND EFFORT INTO THIS

36:33.193 --> 36:34.294
NOT TO GET PAID.

36:34.327 --> 36:35.929
I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING
THAT YOU ASKED ME

36:35.962 --> 36:37.530
TO DO WHEN WE FIRST MET.
- YOU HAVE.

36:37.564 --> 36:38.765
- LET ME EXPLAIN, PLEASE.
LET ME EXPLAIN.

36:38.798 --> 36:40.834
- SOME EXPLAINING TO DO?
NOW YOU ARE RICKY RICARDO.

36:40.867 --> 36:42.102
YOU HAVE SOME EXPLAINING TO DO.
- LISTEN.

36:42.135 --> 36:43.770
- I HAVE LET YOU CALL ME
RICKY RICARDO ALL YOU WANT.

36:43.803 --> 36:45.338
- LUCY, YOU HAVE
SOME EXPLAINING TO DO.

36:45.372 --> 36:46.373
- YES.
- OH, MY GOD.

36:46.406 --> 36:47.674
HE IS SO RICKY RICARDO.

36:47.707 --> 36:49.442
- WHAT THE [bleep]
DO YOU KNOW?

36:49.476 --> 36:52.078
- IT KIND OF SUCKS
THAT YOUR SISTER ISN'T GONNA

36:52.112 --> 36:53.513
GET THE APARTMENT, HUH?

36:53.546 --> 36:54.614
A LARGE PART OF MY JOB

36:54.647 --> 36:56.649
IS KNOWING WHEN TO PUSH
AND WHEN TO PULL.

36:56.683 --> 36:59.185
I'M NOT GONNA CALL
A BROKER'S CLIENT DIRECTLY.

36:59.219 --> 37:00.453
ALL RIGHT,
THANKS, BONNIE.

37:00.487 --> 37:03.556
BUT IN THIS CASE, I KNOW
THE CLIENT'S SISTER.

37:11.798 --> 37:15.535
- ARI, I GOT AN OFFER
FOR THE APTHORP, 2-F.

37:15.568 --> 37:18.038
$8 MILLION, ALL CASH.

37:18.038 --> 37:21.641
- FREDRIK, YOU HAVE THE NERVE.

37:21.675 --> 37:23.410
- 9.5 MILLION
IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

37:23.443 --> 37:25.245
I TOLD YOU THAT
IN THE LISTING APPOINTMENT.

37:25.278 --> 37:26.846
YOU HIRED ME FOR A REASON.
LET ME DO MY JOB.

37:26.880 --> 37:28.081
I SHOULD HAVE COME
INTO THAT LISTING PITCH,

37:28.114 --> 37:30.050
AND I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU,
"DON'T DO THIS."

37:30.050 --> 37:32.285
- BOTTOM LINE IS
I'M GOING TO RENT IT,

37:32.318 --> 37:33.820
NOT WITH YOU.
- WHAT?

37:33.853 --> 37:36.956
- I'M GOING TO RENT IT,
NOT WITH YOU.

37:39.693 --> 37:41.394
- WE GOT OVER AND OVER
FOR YOU

37:41.428 --> 37:44.397
PEOPLE WANTING TO KNOW
HOW IT FELT

37:44.431 --> 37:46.433
WHEN IAN KEPT REFERRING
TO YOU AS RICKY RICARDO.

37:46.466 --> 37:48.968
DID YOU NOT KNOW
WHO RICKY RICARDO WAS?

37:49.069 --> 37:51.071
- [laughs] DUDE, I'VE HEARD IT,
BUT I NEVER DID.

37:51.071 --> 37:53.373
BUT LISTEN, HE--
IT'S NOT WHAT PEOPLE SAY,

37:53.406 --> 37:55.375
IT'S COMING FROM UNDERNEATH,
SO I NEVER TOOK IT PERSONAL.

37:55.408 --> 37:56.609
OBVIOUSLY,
THE WAY IT CAME OUT--

37:56.643 --> 37:58.278
LISTEN, PEOPLE DESTROYED
THIS GUY ON SOCIAL MEDIA.

37:58.311 --> 38:00.080
THEY CALLED HIM RACIST.
THEY CALLED HIM--

38:00.113 --> 38:01.448
YOU KNOW,
"HOW CAN YOU DO THIS TO LUIS?"

38:01.481 --> 38:03.183
- RIGHT.
- BUT, YOU KNOW...

38:03.216 --> 38:04.784
I GUESS, YOU KNOW, THIS IS
THE BUSINESS THAT YOU'RE IN.

38:04.818 --> 38:06.386
YOU MEET CRAZY CLIENTS,
BUT HE'S A GOOD PERSON.

38:06.419 --> 38:07.587
I DO RESPECT HIM.

38:07.620 --> 38:10.056
- DESI ARNAZ WAS COOL,
BY THE WAY.

38:10.090 --> 38:11.358
- I KNOW. I KNOW.
YES, I KNOW.

38:11.391 --> 38:14.427
- YOU KNOW WHO--
- [laughs] I KNOW.

38:14.461 --> 38:16.029
- HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
<i>I LOVE LUCY?</i>

38:16.029 --> 38:17.931
- I HAVE, AFTER I HAVE BEEN
CALLED RICKY RICARDO.

38:18.031 --> 38:19.065
- OKAY.

38:19.099 --> 38:21.701
JENNIFER FROM
ORADELL, NEW JERSEY, SAID,

38:21.735 --> 38:23.036
"FREDRIK, HOW DO YOU FEEL
YOU'VE GROWN

38:23.036 --> 38:25.238
AS A REALTOR
THIS PAST SEASON?"

38:25.271 --> 38:28.141
- I THINK THE TWO LISTINGS THAT
I HAVEN'T SOLD ON THE SHOW--

38:28.174 --> 38:30.043
AND TRUST ME,
'CAUSE YOU KNOW MY EGO--

38:30.043 --> 38:31.444
THOSE TWO LISTINGS HURT,

38:31.478 --> 38:33.146
THE MARBLE HOUSE
AND THE APTHORP.

38:33.179 --> 38:35.949
BUT I WAS THE FIRST ONE
TO POINT AT MYSELF AND SAY,

38:36.049 --> 38:38.351
"I OWNED IT.
I COULDN'T DO IT."

38:38.385 --> 38:39.719
AND THAT'S NEW FOR ME.

38:39.753 --> 38:44.190
- RY, DO YOU REGRET
CALLING YOUR CLIENT'S SISTER?

38:44.224 --> 38:47.927
- YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
WE GO TO PRETTY GREAT LENGTHS

38:47.961 --> 38:49.562
TO GET DEALS DONE.
- YEAH.

38:49.596 --> 38:51.064
- I WAS, LIKE,
IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT,

38:51.064 --> 38:52.866
AND I KIND OF SAW
A LOOPHOLE...

38:52.899 --> 38:54.467
- THAT WAS [bleep] UP.

38:54.501 --> 38:58.071
- WHICH, YOU KNOW,
IN RETROSPECT, I WOULD'VE DONE,

38:58.104 --> 38:59.439
AND THAT WAS
A LITTLE EMBARRASSING,

38:59.472 --> 39:01.074
JUST BECAUSE
IT KIND OF LIKE,

39:01.107 --> 39:02.609
YOU KNOW, YOU TRY TO BE
A GOOD, GOOD BROKER.

39:02.642 --> 39:04.010
YOU TRY TO BE VERY PROFESSIONAL
AT WHAT YOU DO,

39:04.010 --> 39:05.412
BUT THEN, LIKE,
LITTLE MOMENTS LIKE THAT,

39:05.445 --> 39:06.579
PEOPLE DON'T FORGET.

39:06.613 --> 39:07.647
- RIGHT, RIGHT.

39:07.681 --> 39:09.315
COMING UP...

39:09.349 --> 39:11.017
- I THINK YOU NEED TO FIGHT
FOR WHAT YOU THINK IS RIGHT.

39:11.017 --> 39:13.019
AND I FEEL LIKE SOMETIMES
YOU MOLD YOURSELF

39:13.019 --> 39:15.155
TO WHAT YOU THINK PEOPLE WANT
FROM YOU

39:15.188 --> 39:16.890
IN ORDER FOR THEM
TO RESPECT YOU.

39:22.729 --> 39:24.197
- WELCOME BACK

39:24.230 --> 39:25.899
TO THE<i>MILLION DOLLAR LISTING</i>
<i>NEW YORK REUNION.</i>

39:25.932 --> 39:27.701
ONE LAST QUESTION
FOR ALL THREE OF YOU--

39:27.734 --> 39:30.437
THIS ONE FROM DANNY
FROM NEW YORK CITY, WHO SAID,

39:30.470 --> 39:32.539
"IF YOU COULD CHOOSE
ONE TRAIT FROM EACH OTHER

39:32.572 --> 39:36.042
"THAT YOU THINK IS BEST
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE,

39:36.076 --> 39:37.143
WHAT WOULD THAT BE?"

39:37.177 --> 39:39.646
- IS BEST YOU DON'T HAVE?
- YEAH.

39:39.679 --> 39:41.514
WHAT TRAIT, FREDRIK,
OF LUIS'S

39:41.548 --> 39:43.316
ARE YOU GLAD YOU DON'T HAVE?

39:43.350 --> 39:45.151
- SWEARING SO MUCH.
- OKAY.

39:45.185 --> 39:46.353
- WHAT ABOUT RYAN?

39:46.386 --> 39:49.756
- [sighs]
OH, GOSH.

39:49.789 --> 39:53.093
HARASSING
OTHER PEOPLE'S OPEN HOUSES

39:53.126 --> 39:54.561
HAS JUST GOT TO STOP.

39:54.594 --> 39:56.830
- OKAY, LUIS?

39:56.863 --> 39:58.531
- ONE TRAIT OF YOU
THAT I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE?

39:58.565 --> 40:00.633
- YEAH.
- WAS, UM...

40:00.667 --> 40:03.636
TRYING TO DO THINGS IN ORDER
FOR PEOPLE TO LOVE YOU.

40:03.670 --> 40:06.039
PEOPLE WILL LOVE YOU
FOR WHO YOU ARE, MAN.

40:06.072 --> 40:07.774
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T NEED
TO DO THINGS FOR THEM

40:07.807 --> 40:10.610
TO SEE HOW GOOD
AND HOW GREAT YOU ARE.

40:10.643 --> 40:12.445
YOU CONSTANTLY DO THAT.

40:14.581 --> 40:18.418
THE TRAIT
THAT I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE?

40:20.387 --> 40:22.622
I THINK YOU NEED TO--
NO, YOU NEED TO--

40:22.655 --> 40:24.758
YOU NEED TO LOVE YOURSELF
A LITTLE MORE.

40:24.791 --> 40:26.192
- I LOVE YOU.

40:26.226 --> 40:28.795
- NO, SERIOUSLY. AND YOU
NEED TO EMBRACE WHO YOU ARE.

40:28.828 --> 40:30.096
- I'M EMBRACING
YOU RIGHT NOW.

40:30.130 --> 40:31.798
- CAN YOU STOP?

40:31.831 --> 40:33.233
- SORRY, I DIDN'T REALIZE
WHAT I WAS DOING.

40:33.266 --> 40:34.734
- NO, REALLY, REALLY.

40:34.768 --> 40:36.336
I THINK YOU NEED
TO RESPECT YOU, MAN,

40:36.369 --> 40:38.304
AND FIGHT
FOR WHAT YOU THINK IS RIGHT.

40:38.338 --> 40:39.939
AND I FEEL LIKE SOMETIMES
YOU MOLD YOURSELF

40:39.973 --> 40:42.375
TO WHAT YOU THINK PEOPLE
WANT FROM YOU

40:42.409 --> 40:44.177
IN ORDER FOR THEM
TO RESPECT YOU.

40:44.210 --> 40:46.312
- OKAY.
RYAN, YOU'RE LAST.

40:46.346 --> 40:48.682
WORST TRAIT OF LUIS
THAT YOU'RE GLAD YOU DON'T HAVE

40:48.715 --> 40:52.419
AND TRAIT OF FREDRIK'S
YOU'RE GLAD YOU DON'T HAVE.

40:52.452 --> 40:56.856
- FOR FREDRIK,
I'D SAY THE WORST TRAIT...

40:58.224 --> 41:01.661
- WATCH IT. WATCH IT.
- [laughs]

41:01.695 --> 41:05.965
I'M GLAD I DON'T DO...
- MM-HMM.

41:06.066 --> 41:08.435
- ANY KIND OF HIGH KICKS
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

41:08.468 --> 41:09.502
- YOU DON'T.

41:09.536 --> 41:11.071
I'VE SEEN YOU DO THEM.
- I KNOW.

41:11.071 --> 41:12.472
- THEY'RE BAD.
- I DON'T DO THEM.

41:12.505 --> 41:14.107
- YOU WERE ACTUALLY PROMISING.
- [laughs]

41:14.140 --> 41:18.078
- AND WORST TRAIT OF LUIS...

41:18.078 --> 41:22.215
I LEARNED A LONG TIME AGO
TO LEAVE MY PRIDE AT THE DOOR,

41:22.248 --> 41:24.551
AND I CAN SEE THAT
A LITTLE BIT,

41:24.584 --> 41:25.819
WHETHER HE KNOWS IT OR NOT.

41:25.852 --> 41:29.723
BUT THE BEST TRAIT IS
THE GUY CAN WORK A ROOM,

41:29.756 --> 41:31.891
YOU KNOW, HE CAN MAKE SOMEONE
FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM

41:31.925 --> 41:34.561
JUST WITH A SMILE.
- VERY GOOD.

41:34.594 --> 41:36.896
ANY CHANCE OF GETTING
A FREESTYLE RAP FROM YOU

41:36.930 --> 41:38.264
BEFORE WE LEAVE?
- [sighs]

41:38.298 --> 41:40.567
- YOU HAVE ANYTHING?
- OKAY, LET'S GO.

41:40.600 --> 41:41.668
- OKAY, COME ON.
- [laughs]

41:41.701 --> 41:42.936
- ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

41:42.969 --> 41:46.306
- OKAY.
- OKAY, I NEED SOME MUSIC.

41:46.339 --> 41:49.376
- [beatboxing]

41:49.409 --> 41:51.945
- OKAY.

41:51.978 --> 41:54.314
THAT'S--OKAY.

41:54.347 --> 41:57.183
[rapping in Spanish]

NOT THAT GOOD.
