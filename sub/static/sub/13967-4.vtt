- Oh, hello, Dr. Pavlov.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.374
(announcer) "Sex&Drugs&Rock&Roll."

00:08.376 --> 00:11.140
<i>All new Thursdays</i>

00:18.952 --> 00:20.652
<i> Previously on</i>
 "Tyrant"

00:20.654 --> 00:23.080
- Is there news?
- No, but it can't be good.

00:24.391 --> 00:26.058
She pointed her gun at me

00:26.060 --> 00:27.690
and she shot me.

00:27.690 --> 00:28.994
And then...

00:28.996 --> 00:30.230
(crying) I'm sorry.

00:30.230 --> 00:32.197
I don't want your apologies!

00:32.198 --> 00:34.230
I want my daughter back!

(Dr. Samaha)<i> His surviving kidney</i>

00:36.637 --> 00:39.400
Effectively, he's
facing total renal failure.

00:39.400 --> 00:40.572
So he needs a kidney.

00:40.574 --> 00:42.574
- Nusrat...
- She was my wife.

00:42.576 --> 00:45.370
She hated me and
wanted to kill me.

00:45.370 --> 00:46.645
Because you violated her.

00:46.647 --> 00:49.081
You put her fingers inside of
her the night of our wedding.

00:49.083 --> 00:50.215
I love you.

00:50.217 --> 00:52.117
(grunting)

00:52.117 --> 00:54.110
(monitor beeps fast)

00:54.888 --> 00:57.156
(heart monitor flatlines)

00:57.158 --> 00:58.950
- Madam.
- General.

00:58.950 --> 01:00.592
I'm here as Foreign Secretary.

01:00.594 --> 01:01.960
- For now.
- Right.

01:01.960 --> 01:03.595
We wouldn't want
to be inappropriate.

01:04.831 --> 01:07.066
Your wife for your daughter.

01:07.068 --> 01:08.767
I can't do that.

01:08.769 --> 01:10.900
- I want the Al Fayeeds
- (Emma sobbing)

01:10.900 --> 01:12.771
to pay the price for once.

01:12.773 --> 01:13.772
Mommy!

01:13.774 --> 01:15.007
(flesh squelching)
(groans)

01:15.009 --> 01:16.341
No!

01:16.343 --> 01:17.943
No.

01:19.612 --> 01:21.480
No!

01:40.366 --> 01:42.901
You should try to sleep.

01:42.903 --> 01:45.003
We both should.

01:47.407 --> 01:50.109
She said "Mommy."

01:52.212 --> 01:54.146
"Mommy."

01:55.748 --> 01:57.616
I can still hear it.

01:57.618 --> 02:01.186
Her voice.

02:02.388 --> 02:04.923
I can't get it out of my head.

02:04.925 --> 02:08.594
Calling for me,
 I can't... (inhales sharply)

02:08.596 --> 02:11.296
They always say "Dada" first.

02:12.799 --> 02:15.467
(laughs)

02:15.469 --> 02:17.402
But Emma,
 she said "Mama."

02:17.404 --> 02:19.805
"Mommy."

02:19.807 --> 02:21.573
Her first word.

02:24.277 --> 02:26.345
Her last.

02:29.282 --> 02:31.350
We need to get
her body back.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.521
I need to see it buried.
I need to see her.

02:37.790 --> 02:39.650
Molly, I want her
body back, too,

02:39.650 --> 02:41.860
but they're not
gonna give it to us.

02:41.860 --> 02:44.860
(inhales deeply)

02:46.260 --> 02:48.860
(body thuds)

02:48.860 --> 02:51.860
(low hum of chat)

02:53.640 --> 02:57.543
Remove the cloth.

02:57.545 --> 03:01.040
The "American President
of Abuddin" will be more angry

03:01.040 --> 03:03.549
over this one's death
than his wife's.

03:03.551 --> 03:05.617
We're not going to bury her?

03:10.657 --> 03:13.192
She'll be covered
by dirt soon enough.

03:13.194 --> 03:16.161
Till then, let them see.

03:16.163 --> 03:19.990
Her flesh rots
the same way ours does.

03:27.574 --> 03:29.408
(Aziz)<i>They request that
 their privacy</i>

03:29.410 --> 03:32.980
be respected as they cope
with the tragic death

03:32.980 --> 03:34.910
of their beloved daughter,
 Emma.

03:34.910 --> 03:36.215
- How could you be so cold?
- (Aziz continues indistinctly)

03:36.217 --> 03:37.482
She was just a child.

03:37.484 --> 03:38.717
I'm not cold.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.352
I'm sorry she's dead.

03:40.354 --> 03:41.850
I don't want anyone to die.

03:41.850 --> 03:44.056
All I'm saying,
and mark my words,

03:44.058 --> 03:47.990
they will start a war over the
death of a single American girl.

03:49.562 --> 03:51.163
- Shakir.
- (mouth full) Sorry.

03:51.165 --> 03:52.698
Mind your manners, boy.

03:52.700 --> 03:55.430
- Where's your prayer?
- If Jamal Al Fayeed gases Ma'an

03:55.430 --> 03:59.404
and a thousand of us perish,
nothing.

03:59.406 --> 04:01.840
When our children
die, we weep alone.

04:01.842 --> 04:04.470
Yet they expect the whole world
to howl at the death

04:04.470 --> 04:05.410
of one of theirs.

04:08.114 --> 04:10.249
Say that
in your announcement today.

04:10.249 --> 04:13.240
- (Aziz's speech in background)
- (Al-Qadi sighs)

04:16.956 --> 04:19.990
Do you know my last name?

04:19.990 --> 04:22.120
The one I was born with?

04:23.396 --> 04:25.030
No.

04:25.032 --> 04:28.467
Haddad.

04:28.469 --> 04:31.970
My name is Leila Haddad.

04:31.972 --> 04:33.870
Not an Al Fayeed.

04:33.870 --> 04:36.875
I... just put on the clothes
and dress like one.

04:36.877 --> 04:39.144
For more than 20 years.

04:42.815 --> 04:45.584
Now I could just...

04:45.586 --> 04:49.187
bury that man's body and
leave this place forever.

04:50.823 --> 04:52.724
But that would mean
 you'd won.

05:02.268 --> 05:05.370
(sobbing)

05:17.450 --> 05:19.985
I gave you everything.

05:21.754 --> 05:24.950
I gave you my life.

05:27.026 --> 05:30.760
And waited for the day
my son and I would be rewarded

05:30.760 --> 05:32.664
for that sacrifice, Jamal.

05:36.369 --> 05:40.172
It was too high a price.

05:41.841 --> 05:43.475
(Leila inhales deeply)

05:43.477 --> 05:47.346
So what am I still doing,
weeping over your body?

05:49.148 --> 05:52.617
I promised myself
I wouldn't do that.

06:05.732 --> 06:08.033
(clears throat) We're, um...

06:08.035 --> 06:10.268
We're meeting in the war room
in ten minutes.

06:23.549 --> 06:26.385
I'm sorry.

06:27.553 --> 06:29.388
You too.

06:33.993 --> 06:35.694
We need to...

06:35.696 --> 06:38.063
to, uh...

06:38.065 --> 06:41.266
bury Jamal and Rami.

06:43.703 --> 06:45.003
And Emma.

06:46.672 --> 06:48.673
We need to do
a memorial service.

06:48.675 --> 06:51.943
The prayers.

06:51.945 --> 06:53.812
Since we don't have her.

06:57.216 --> 06:58.784
Right.

06:58.786 --> 07:01.686
I'll arrange that.

07:05.458 --> 07:07.192
Thank you.

07:13.733 --> 07:15.434
(Cogswell) If we kill Rashid
 and the sheik,

07:15.436 --> 07:17.970
it won't stop the Caliphate.
It won't even slow them down.

07:17.970 --> 07:19.830
It'll weaken
their internal structure.

07:19.830 --> 07:21.573
Yes, for a time.

07:21.575 --> 07:23.840
But then others will
rise up to replace them.

07:23.840 --> 07:26.210
I've seen this countless
times, Mr. President.

07:26.210 --> 07:28.210
If you want to
destabilize the Caliphate,

07:28.210 --> 07:29.850
you've got to think bigger.

07:29.850 --> 07:30.710
I get it, General,

07:30.710 --> 07:33.010
and when my army is back
to fighting strength,

07:33.010 --> 07:34.886
that's exactly what we'll do.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.655
But first I want them dead.

07:38.658 --> 07:40.992
How do we do it?

07:40.994 --> 07:44.396
UAVs armed with
air-to-surface missiles.

07:44.398 --> 07:46.990
Once we know where they are,
we move.

07:51.070 --> 07:53.438
Then that's the plan.

07:53.440 --> 07:55.941
(Al-Qadi over P.A.) On this tragic day,

07:55.943 --> 07:59.611
with you and God
 as my witness,

07:59.613 --> 08:03.515
I announce my candidacy
for President of Abuddin.

08:03.517 --> 08:05.180
(applause)

08:05.180 --> 08:06.610
(people murmuring)

08:06.610 --> 08:09.488
It is a dangerous time
for our country.

08:09.490 --> 08:12.324
There is a risk
we give in to anger,

08:12.326 --> 08:14.125
fall prey

08:14.127 --> 08:16.194
to our old animosities,

08:16.196 --> 08:18.430
resort to violence.

08:18.432 --> 08:21.333
But it's an opportunity.

08:21.335 --> 08:24.503
An opportunity to
reclaim our lost heritage,

08:24.505 --> 08:28.240
to follow the example,
our prophet Muhammad,

08:28.240 --> 08:29.640
<i> salla llahu wa-sallam,</i>

08:29.640 --> 08:33.544
who taught that extremism and
violence has no place in Islam.

08:33.547 --> 08:36.181
(cheering and applause)

08:38.451 --> 08:42.888
My vision is
of an authentic Islam,

08:42.890 --> 08:44.590
one that remembers

08:44.590 --> 08:48.159
that tolerance is fundamental
to our faith.

08:48.161 --> 08:50.028
Because...

08:50.030 --> 08:53.832
Islam is salaam.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.700
Peace.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.302
And peace be upon you.

08:57.304 --> 09:01.106
(cheering and applause)

09:03.009 --> 09:04.309
(door opens)

09:09.382 --> 09:10.982
Thank you, Aziz.

09:10.984 --> 09:12.910
Mr. President.

09:15.790 --> 09:17.990
(door lock clicks)

09:17.990 --> 09:19.291
Bassam...

09:28.901 --> 09:30.990
I couldn't bring myself
to come here before.

09:33.105 --> 09:36.107
I tried,

09:36.109 --> 09:37.742
but...

09:44.417 --> 09:46.418
We have no daughters.

09:46.418 --> 09:48.410
(inhales sharply)

09:58.097 --> 10:00.532
(deep sigh)

10:02.200 --> 10:06.037
My God, Fauzi, I don't know
what to do, I'm so lost.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.639
Of course you are.

10:07.641 --> 10:11.170
I prayed to God to let me go
back in time one year.

10:13.546 --> 10:15.714
Just give me one more chance.

10:15.716 --> 10:18.717
But we can only go forward.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.360
I'm going to run for president.

10:31.764 --> 10:33.460
And try to finish
what you started.

10:33.460 --> 10:34.899
If I can.

10:34.901 --> 10:38.336
So our daughters won't
have died for nothing.

10:41.273 --> 10:43.241
(sighs)

10:50.840 --> 10:53.640
(hairbrush clatters)

10:58.791 --> 11:01.359
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.161
What?

11:03.163 --> 11:05.930
Excuse me.

11:05.932 --> 11:07.830
God, what a mess.

11:10.302 --> 11:11.870
Teenagers.

11:11.872 --> 11:14.372
You'd think she was
raised by wolves.

11:14.374 --> 11:17.976
Like Romulus and Remus,
you know, the...

11:17.978 --> 11:19.477
twins who founded Rome.

11:19.479 --> 11:22.247
Ma'am?

11:24.183 --> 11:26.550
When you lose 20% of
your blood volume,

11:26.550 --> 11:29.487
you go into
hypovolemic shock.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.489
I'm sorry we haven't
cleaned in here yet.

11:31.491 --> 11:32.920
We thought that...

11:32.920 --> 11:34.993
But that takes minutes.

11:34.995 --> 11:37.390
Maybe hours.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.970
But if...
(door closes)

11:49.141 --> 11:51.443
if the knife punctured
her kidney...

11:54.714 --> 11:57.380
she'd lose consciousness
in under a second.

12:02.521 --> 12:04.750
And then dead in a minute.

12:08.260 --> 12:09.761
Lying down there
 on the ground.

12:13.833 --> 12:15.900
Dead in a minute.

12:20.172 --> 12:22.073
Dead in a minute.

12:23.275 --> 12:24.976
(softly) Dead.

Sometimes he has a beard.
Sometimes he shaves.

Which is strange for a jihadi.

14:32.800 --> 14:35.440
He looks nothing like
the university pictures.

 20 pounds.

He hides under a rock.

We haven't yet pinpointed

14:48.520 --> 14:49.354
where to bomb.

14:49.356 --> 14:50.780
The man who killed my
daughter is still alive.

14:50.780 --> 14:53.725
I... I can't stand the
thought of him living.

14:53.727 --> 14:55.326
Okay, okay.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.062
While she's... Okay.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.264
While her body is

14:59.266 --> 15:00.765

15:00.767 --> 15:03.101
And he's sleeping peacefully.

15:03.103 --> 15:06.271
He's breathing
and you're just sitting there!

15:06.273 --> 15:08.200
I want him dead
as much as you do.

15:08.200 --> 15:09.774
But, please,

15:09.776 --> 15:12.443
give me a little time.

15:18.885 --> 15:21.886
We need to talk
about the funeral.

15:21.888 --> 15:24.756
We need her body back.

15:24.758 --> 15:27.290
I... I called
the State Department.

15:27.290 --> 15:29.560
I tried to talk to Exley,
but she couldn't help me.

15:29.562 --> 15:30.962
Nobody could help me.

15:30.964 --> 15:32.897
Some bullshit about...
I don't know.

15:32.899 --> 15:34.933
So you need to do it.

15:34.935 --> 15:37.400
Okay, you need
to get it back somehow.

15:37.400 --> 15:39.930
Molly, it will be
easier to kill Ihab

15:39.930 --> 15:41.472
than to get her body.

15:41.474 --> 15:44.742

be buried very soon.

15:44.744 --> 15:47.440
And we have to say
prayers for Emma.

15:47.440 --> 15:48.613
Prayers?

15:48.615 --> 15:50.281
What kind of prayers?

15:52.151 --> 15:54.450
- You mean Muslim prayers?
- Yes.

15:54.450 --> 15:56.220
But Emma isn't Muslim.

15:56.222 --> 15:59.290
We're the first family
of a Muslim country.

15:59.290 --> 16:00.230
The people believe...

16:00.230 --> 16:02.593
I don't care
what the people believe.

16:02.595 --> 16:05.730
The man who killed her
is a Muslim.

16:05.730 --> 16:07.665
And you want
to bury her that way?

16:07.667 --> 16:09.400
No.

16:09.402 --> 16:10.802
I won't have it.

16:10.804 --> 16:12.200
Emma wouldn't want this!

16:12.200 --> 16:13.338
She would hate this!

16:15.174 --> 16:17.675
I won't let you do it.

16:18.670 --> 16:21.670
(footsteps departing fast)

16:25.520 --> 16:28.620
(generic traffic noise)
(people chatting)

16:28.620 --> 16:30.288
You ready?

16:30.290 --> 16:32.090
Hardly.

16:32.092 --> 16:35.290
I feel like I'm jumping off
a cliff with my eyes closed.

16:35.290 --> 16:37.890
It's the very best thing
you could have done for him.

16:37.890 --> 16:39.530
For our whole country.

16:39.532 --> 16:40.999
(chuckles)

16:41.001 --> 16:42.266
I hope so.

16:42.268 --> 16:43.634
We'll see.

16:43.636 --> 16:45.670
That your speech?

16:45.672 --> 16:46.704
Yeah.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.039
Take a look.

16:48.041 --> 16:50.675
Not that I can
change anything now.

16:53.178 --> 16:55.513
Okay, so I'll introduce you,
and then you come out.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.115
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

17:01.010 --> 17:02.910
(sighs)

17:08.493 --> 17:10.528
It's wonderful.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.730
Really?
You liked it?

17:12.732 --> 17:14.665
Yes.

17:14.666 --> 17:15.967
(Halima)<i> Good afternoon. </i>
(crowd cheering)

17:15.969 --> 17:17.270
<i> Thank you for coming
 to show</i>

17:17.270 --> 17:19.537
<i> your support
 for Fauzi Nidal.</i>

17:19.539 --> 17:21.973
On this day of grief,

17:21.974 --> 17:27.369
I announce my candidacy
for presidency of Abuddin.

17:28.047 --> 17:31.082
My hope for this country is

17:31.084 --> 17:34.685
that even in the wake
of terrible loss...

17:34.687 --> 17:37.055
loss that I

17:37.057 --> 17:39.857
and so many of you
know too well...

17:39.859 --> 17:42.760
we do not lose heart.

17:42.762 --> 17:46.197
But instead
that we gain in wisdom.

17:46.199 --> 17:50.701
That we rededicate ourselves
to the principles

17:50.703 --> 17:53.371
of Bassam Al Fayeed's
revolution.

17:53.373 --> 17:56.007
That those of us
 who are broken

17:56.009 --> 17:59.610
and this country 
that is broken

17:59.612 --> 18:02.747
heal together.

18:02.749 --> 18:07.051
And that the battle
for a tolerant,

18:07.053 --> 18:10.990
modern, Muslim, secular,

18:10.990 --> 18:13.691
just and fair Abuddin,

18:13.693 --> 18:16.127
begun on a battlefield,

18:16.129 --> 18:20.364
ends with a victory
at the ballot box.

18:20.366 --> 18:22.433
(crowd cheering)

18:25.971 --> 18:27.805
Aunt Safiya.

18:27.807 --> 18:30.274
Ahmed.

18:31.610 --> 18:33.240
Oh, you look good.

18:33.240 --> 18:33.978
Ah...

18:33.980 --> 18:35.313
Fit.

18:35.315 --> 18:37.810
I clearly missed you
turning into a man.

18:37.810 --> 18:39.650
I tried to wait
for you, but...

18:39.650 --> 18:41.719
(laughs)

18:41.721 --> 18:44.889
I'm so sorry
about your father.

18:46.225 --> 18:47.959
Thank you.

18:47.961 --> 18:51.030
But if you and my mother
could be friends again now...

18:51.030 --> 18:53.290
Oh, we'll see about that.

18:53.290 --> 18:55.166
This is business.

18:55.168 --> 18:57.668
Election business.

18:59.805 --> 19:01.800
How are my nephews?

19:01.800 --> 19:03.608
And my niece?

19:03.610 --> 19:06.978
Excited their aunt
is running for President.

19:08.347 --> 19:11.048
Is that how their mother feels?

19:12.484 --> 19:14.952
I'm very sorry about Jamal.

19:14.954 --> 19:17.155
Are you?
About Jamal?

19:17.157 --> 19:18.890
For your sake, yes.

19:18.890 --> 19:21.659
Even though he's
never liked me much.

19:21.661 --> 19:25.390
What I never figured out was
whether it was because of that,

19:25.390 --> 19:27.630
or because you didn't
care for my husband,

19:27.630 --> 19:30.460
or that you simply
grew tired of me

19:30.460 --> 19:32.430
that I stopped
hearing from you.

19:32.430 --> 19:33.470
Safiya...

19:33.470 --> 19:35.500
Not that it matters much now.

19:35.500 --> 19:36.941
You called me.

19:36.943 --> 19:39.744
Then again,
you need something from me.

19:40.779 --> 19:43.614
I do need something.

19:43.616 --> 19:46.450
Jamal's assets are frozen.

19:46.452 --> 19:50.320
I will give you
all the financial support I can.

19:50.320 --> 19:52.750
I've also contacted
James Kipfer.

19:52.750 --> 19:53.890
He has advised

19:53.890 --> 19:56.561
Merkel, Cameron, Netanyahu.

19:56.563 --> 19:58.329
He's very good.

19:58.331 --> 20:00.131
You move quickly.

20:00.133 --> 20:02.460
I don't want the Caliphate
taking control

20:02.460 --> 20:04.235
of my husband's
shipping lanes.

20:05.637 --> 20:08.206
We need each other, then.

20:08.208 --> 20:10.408
So it seems.

20:10.410 --> 20:11.910
You're not a baby, Ibro.

20:11.910 --> 20:13.377
You make your own decisions.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.215
Like fighting for Allah.

20:17.217 --> 20:18.716
Yes, Sheik.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.051
Al-Fransi?

20:20.053 --> 20:21.586
Phone for the young man.

20:21.588 --> 20:23.721
Candy for the others.

20:27.426 --> 20:29.690
Your father was a good man.

20:33.332 --> 20:34.832
You're right.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.700
These boys are
ethnic Ma'anians.

20:36.700 --> 20:37.830
I can tell from
their accents.

20:37.830 --> 20:39.430
The idle youth.

20:39.430 --> 20:41.230
They should be in one
of my training camps.

20:41.230 --> 20:42.673
Or in school.

20:42.675 --> 20:44.675
I had to shut the schools.

20:44.677 --> 20:46.340
All the teachers left.

20:46.340 --> 20:47.411
Everyone's left.

20:47.413 --> 20:50.014
Engineers, electricians,
trash collectors.

20:50.016 --> 20:52.450
You won't keep
the people's loyalty

20:52.450 --> 20:54.452
if you can't provide
basic services.

20:54.454 --> 20:57.720
With the whole world
dropping its bombs on Syria,

20:57.720 --> 20:59.790
it will never
get better for us here.

20:59.792 --> 21:01.420
We're going to
need a better army

21:01.420 --> 21:02.593
than the one
your brother had.

21:02.595 --> 21:03.794
I'm building an army.

21:03.796 --> 21:05.129
You'll see.

21:05.131 --> 21:08.466
What's with
the umbrella?

21:08.468 --> 21:10.968
Eyes in the sky.

21:12.571 --> 21:14.370
Like Argus Panoptes,

21:14.370 --> 21:16.707
the hundred-eyed
primordial Titan,

21:16.709 --> 21:19.140
we see everything
everywhere.

21:19.140 --> 21:20.811
General, I have an umbrella.

21:20.813 --> 21:22.813
- Show me.
- An umbrella?

21:22.815 --> 21:25.410
Well, chatter indicates
that Abdullah carries

21:25.410 --> 21:27.210
a black umbrella
with him everywhere.

21:27.210 --> 21:29.186
Let's get details.

21:29.186 --> 21:30.650
(beeping)

21:30.650 --> 21:33.057
That could be
Ihab Rashid.

21:33.059 --> 21:36.427
Shadows put him at six feet.

21:36.429 --> 21:38.095
Which is consistent
with current intel.

21:38.097 --> 21:39.897
You see how he
protects his arm?

21:39.899 --> 21:41.899
That's a prosthetic.

21:41.901 --> 21:43.668
Don't lose him.

21:44.803 --> 21:45.970
(knocking)

21:45.972 --> 21:47.638
Come in.

21:49.474 --> 21:51.842
We have an update, sir.

21:55.781 --> 21:58.482
We have eyes on the target
for the first time.

21:58.484 --> 21:59.583
Both of them?

22:00.585 --> 22:01.619
Where are they?

22:01.621 --> 22:02.620
The local hospital.

22:02.622 --> 22:04.340
Most likely they'll be

22:04.340 --> 22:05.180
there for the night.

22:05.180 --> 22:06.620
- Why?
- Oh, that's standard

22:06.620 --> 22:08.159
Caliphate operating procedure.

22:08.161 --> 22:10.220
It's the way
they protect themselves.

22:10.220 --> 22:12.020
You're sure it's them...
If we hit that hospital,

22:12.020 --> 22:13.631
- we kill them?
- Correct.

22:13.633 --> 22:15.430
Who else is inside?
How many patients?

22:15.430 --> 22:16.660
How many doctors and nurses?

22:16.660 --> 22:18.460
- We don't know.
- So it could be empty?

22:18.460 --> 22:20.271
It could be.

22:22.870 --> 22:27.870

So...

24:14.754 --> 24:16.387

Well, first I decide

You're the wife

What makes you think
anyone would vote for you?

24:33.638 --> 24:35.673
I'm not my husband.

24:35.675 --> 24:37.970
In fact, as you may know,

24:37.970 --> 24:40.411
I helped depose him.

24:40.413 --> 24:43.180
I'm the daughter
of domestic servants.

24:43.180 --> 24:46.917
Like every poor and working
class person in this country,

24:46.919 --> 24:50.588
I've spent my life doing
what I had to do to survive.

24:50.590 --> 24:52.156
That's made me tough.

24:52.158 --> 24:53.657
Which is a good thing.

24:53.659 --> 24:56.827
Because we're surrounded
by enemies.

24:56.829 --> 24:59.860
I wouldn't turn this country
over to a cleric

24:59.860 --> 25:01.932
who wants to bring us
back to the Middle Ages.

25:01.934 --> 25:05.202
Or a journalist who ran away
just when things got tough.

25:05.204 --> 25:08.105
They have no idea
what this job takes.

25:08.107 --> 25:11.275
But I've been there.

25:14.446 --> 25:16.990
I don't imagine you've got

25:16.990 --> 25:19.140
a chance in hell
of winning this election.

25:20.652 --> 25:22.486
But I like you.

25:22.488 --> 25:24.920
And I think you mean
what you say.

25:27.158 --> 25:28.792
Let's do this.

25:29.728 --> 25:30.961
Great.

25:33.798 --> 25:35.332
By the way,

25:35.334 --> 25:37.600
forget the young,
the poor, the working class.

25:37.600 --> 25:39.330
It's not your constituency.

25:39.330 --> 25:41.200
Strength, stability,

25:41.200 --> 25:43.007
security, prosperity.

25:43.009 --> 25:45.376
Scare them.

25:45.378 --> 25:47.044
Then make them feel safe.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.710
That's your platform.

I'd like to get to know you.

26:39.599 --> 26:41.860
Not just your body.

Okay.

27:05.590 --> 27:07.424

27:07.426 --> 27:09.360
You did it to yourself.

27:11.062 --> 27:12.490
You turned me in.

27:12.490 --> 27:14.890
So this?
This is your work.

27:14.890 --> 27:16.734
You deserved it.

27:16.736 --> 27:18.102
Shit.

27:18.104 --> 27:20.437
You're more dangerous

Oh, you think

27:37.156 --> 27:39.289
She's uh...

27:39.291 --> 27:42.726
She's not coming.

27:44.696 --> 27:46.360
Where were you this morning?

27:46.360 --> 27:49.033
I couldn't find you.

27:49.035 --> 27:50.334
At the university.

27:51.302 --> 27:54.505
By yourself?

27:54.507 --> 27:57.340
Sammy, do you have any idea
how dangerous that is?

27:57.340 --> 27:58.308
What's wrong with you?

27:58.310 --> 28:01.578
I just needed
someone to talk to.

28:02.981 --> 28:05.449
(Taymullah) We're gathered here

28:05.451 --> 28:08.018
to say prayers for
Emma Al Fayeed.

28:08.020 --> 28:11.820
After which, we will move
to the family cemetery

28:11.820 --> 28:13.791
and send the bodies
of Jamal Al Fayeed

28:13.793 --> 28:16.694
and Rami Said back to God.

28:16.696 --> 28:20.130
In the name of God,
the beneficent, the merciful,

28:20.132 --> 28:23.734
to Him belongs the dominion
of the heavens and the earth.

28:23.736 --> 28:26.160
He gives life
and He takes it away.

28:26.170 --> 28:28.806
He has power
 over all things.

28:28.808 --> 28:31.975
(whispering) Mr. President,
can I have a moment?

28:34.879 --> 28:37.050
If you're going to draw the
American into a land war,

28:37.050 --> 28:40.851
we need to double, triple
the number of our troops.

28:40.853 --> 28:43.921
We'll be strong enough
when the time comes.

28:43.923 --> 28:46.323
And we have God
on our side.

28:46.325 --> 28:48.225
Greetings, children.

28:48.227 --> 28:49.927
Salaam alaikum.

28:49.929 --> 28:52.496
(children) Wa alaikum as-salaam.

28:52.498 --> 28:54.698
Do you see
these brave young men?

28:54.700 --> 28:57.601
They're serving God.

28:57.603 --> 29:00.170
Who else would like
to serve God in his army?

29:04.409 --> 29:06.710
It's the highest honor.

29:06.712 --> 29:09.079
Does anyone know
any mujahideen?

29:09.081 --> 29:10.214
Ah, yes, Sheik.

29:10.216 --> 29:11.548
My brothers.

29:11.550 --> 29:13.480
I have two, Baka and Taj.

29:13.480 --> 29:16.280
That's wonderful, wonderful.

29:17.355 --> 29:18.950
(intelligence officer) We lost them
 temporarily.

29:18.950 --> 29:20.420
They went inside that
building over there.

29:20.420 --> 29:21.390
But they're still inside?

29:21.390 --> 29:23.490
Maybe, but we don't know
for certain.

29:23.490 --> 29:24.860
There are tunnels
and many exits,

29:24.860 --> 29:26.190
but, yes,
they may be inside.

29:26.190 --> 29:27.830
You're certain this
is a training camp?

29:27.830 --> 29:29.990
Absolutely certain.
Do you see that?

29:29.990 --> 29:32.402
That's a cache of
Chinese CQ rifles.

29:32.404 --> 29:35.170
And there... mortar launchers
covered in tarp.

29:35.170 --> 29:36.540
General, you agree?

29:36.540 --> 29:38.709
Yes, sir, it's a
terrorist training camp.

29:38.711 --> 29:40.140
Do we have the go-ahead?

29:40.140 --> 29:41.840
(Molly) Yes.

29:44.480 --> 29:47.480
(indistinct radio chat)

29:47.480 --> 29:50.488
(exhales sharply)

29:50.488 --> 29:52.556
Yes.

30:01.099 --> 30:06.090
♪♪

30:41.339 --> 30:44.141
You're still here.

30:44.143 --> 30:46.777
We buried him
after you left.

30:46.779 --> 30:48.912
He's gone.

30:50.481 --> 30:52.549
He's really gone.

30:52.551 --> 30:53.817
He's not gone.

30:53.819 --> 30:56.520
Not for me.

30:56.522 --> 30:58.555
I'll never be rid of him.

30:58.557 --> 31:00.290
That's not true, Ahmed.

31:00.292 --> 31:02.693
You're free now.

31:02.695 --> 31:05.295
I'm not.

31:05.297 --> 31:07.364
I'm his son.

31:07.366 --> 31:08.799
He's inside of me.

31:08.801 --> 31:10.901
He's not.

31:13.404 --> 31:15.305
You're nothing like him.

31:15.307 --> 31:18.709
You have no idea.

31:18.711 --> 31:20.978
(crying) I'm him.

31:20.980 --> 31:23.213
I am.

31:23.215 --> 31:25.716
You don't know
what's in my head.

31:25.718 --> 31:28.518
Or my heart.

31:28.520 --> 31:32.055
I'm capable of
 terrible things.

31:32.057 --> 31:34.558
Ahmed, you are not him.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.190
You inherited nothing
from him.

31:36.190 --> 31:37.928
What does that mean?

31:37.930 --> 31:39.496
What does it mean?

31:39.498 --> 31:43.267
You're just trying
to make me feel better.

31:43.269 --> 31:45.335
Go away.

31:45.337 --> 31:47.804
Leave me be.

31:49.800 --> 31:52.800
(Ahmed sighs heavily)

31:55.990 --> 31:58.990
(radio chat in background)

32:00.852 --> 32:03.854
Can I?

32:03.856 --> 32:06.156
Yeah, of course.

32:17.568 --> 32:18.769
Is he dead?

32:18.771 --> 32:21.371
We don't know yet.

32:21.370 --> 32:25.370
(soldiers speak indistinctly)
(keyboard clanking)

32:30.148 --> 32:32.683
I'm sorry, Sammy.

32:36.955 --> 32:38.622
About what?

32:40.291 --> 32:42.359
Everything.

32:44.629 --> 32:48.532
(sighing) Not being there
 for Emma.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.501
Not being here for you

32:51.503 --> 32:54.638
or your mom.

32:55.807 --> 32:59.076
I am trying, I'm...

32:59.078 --> 33:01.878
I'm trying.

33:10.188 --> 33:13.256
Dad, are you okay?

33:13.258 --> 33:16.593
I mean, Mom, she's...
she's a wreck.

33:16.595 --> 33:17.990
But you always seem...

33:17.990 --> 33:20.263
I'm not okay.

33:24.102 --> 33:27.270
I'm not okay.

33:34.112 --> 33:37.514
I love you.

33:44.889 --> 33:47.124
(door opens)

33:53.064 --> 33:56.033
It's not a good time.

33:57.902 --> 33:59.870
A man returned to Abuddin
a few days

33:59.872 --> 34:01.905
before
 I was to marry Jamal.

34:04.342 --> 34:06.943
He came for the wedding.

34:08.413 --> 34:10.746
I was in love with him
since I was a girl.

34:10.748 --> 34:12.748
He came to see me...

34:12.751 --> 34:15.152
and we were...

34:17.722 --> 34:19.389
we were together.

34:19.391 --> 34:22.391
The man you told me about?

34:24.062 --> 34:26.163
You're that man's son.

34:29.667 --> 34:31.168
He doesn't know.

34:31.170 --> 34:34.337
Jamal never knew it.

34:34.339 --> 34:36.840
I couldn't tell anyone
while he was alive.

34:36.842 --> 34:38.942
But now that he's dead...

34:38.944 --> 34:40.777
That can't be true.

34:46.117 --> 34:48.518
After you were born,

34:48.520 --> 34:50.920
I couldn't get pregnant again.

34:50.922 --> 34:53.356
For two years,
Jamal and I tried.

34:53.358 --> 34:55.192
We went to
a fertility clinic.

34:55.194 --> 34:57.461
It was him.

34:57.463 --> 34:59.096
His sperm.

35:00.598 --> 35:03.433
Why do you think you never
had any brothers and sisters?

35:03.435 --> 35:06.203
I told him it was me.

35:06.205 --> 35:08.405
But what about Rami?

35:08.407 --> 35:10.574
He wasn't Jamal's son.

35:10.576 --> 35:12.742
You'd have to ask his mother
why she lied.

35:12.744 --> 35:15.645
A measure of revenge,
I suppose.

35:15.647 --> 35:17.647
I don't believe this.

35:17.649 --> 35:20.617
Call the doctor, then.

35:20.619 --> 35:24.688
Ask for the results
of your kidney test.

35:33.397 --> 35:35.799
Who was it?

35:35.801 --> 35:38.735
This man you were
so in love with?

35:40.838 --> 35:43.140
Bassam.

35:47.979 --> 35:51.314
You're Bassam's son.

35:54.519 --> 35:57.320
Does he...

35:57.322 --> 35:58.922
Does he know?

35:58.924 --> 36:01.658
No.

36:05.496 --> 36:08.064
Now is not the time
 to tell him.

36:09.033 --> 36:12.636
Promise me
you won't tell him, Ahmed.

36:12.638 --> 36:15.071
Okay.

36:17.175 --> 36:20.343
I know you judge me
 for this.

36:21.879 --> 36:24.314
What would be the point
of judging you?

36:24.316 --> 36:27.450
The horrible thing...

36:27.452 --> 36:30.654
The really horrible thing is...

36:30.656 --> 36:33.490
he was the man
 who raised me,

36:33.492 --> 36:36.726
and now he's dead,

36:36.728 --> 36:39.963
and he's not
 my real father.

36:41.299 --> 36:44.568
And you know
 what I feel?

36:44.570 --> 36:47.771
You know what I feel
more than anything?

36:49.707 --> 36:52.309
Relief.

37:02.053 --> 37:04.287
No.

37:06.023 --> 37:07.490
No.

37:07.492 --> 37:09.125
No, no, no, no, no, no.

37:11.596 --> 37:14.798
No, no, no!

37:18.069 --> 37:20.237
- Where is she?
- Ma'am?

37:20.239 --> 37:22.370
The maid,
the one who cleans our room...

37:22.370 --> 37:23.640
Emma's room...
Where is she?

37:23.640 --> 37:24.740
- I don't...
- The maid.

37:24.740 --> 37:25.740
She's... She's tall, skinny.

37:25.740 --> 37:26.740
She wears exactly 
what you wear.

37:26.740 --> 37:27.770
Sh... She's the goddamn maid.

37:27.770 --> 37:29.440
- Ma'am, please.
- Ma'am?

37:29.440 --> 37:30.947
You.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.450
(hard slap)
(maid cries)

37:33.452 --> 37:35.752
You erased my daughter.

37:35.754 --> 37:37.120
Do you understand?

37:38.055 --> 37:39.750
Get up!

37:39.750 --> 37:41.124
What did I do?

37:41.126 --> 37:42.390
I don't do anyth...

37:42.390 --> 37:43.890
You threw her away!

37:43.890 --> 37:45.490
- You erased her.
- Stop.

37:45.490 --> 37:46.890
Stop.

37:46.890 --> 37:48.860
- You erased her.
- You have to stop.

37:51.736 --> 37:53.036
(whimpers)

37:54.440 --> 37:57.440
(footsteps departing fast)

37:58.442 --> 38:00.277
I'm sorry.

38:05.549 --> 38:08.010
(Ihab on TV) This is
 an American missile.

38:08.010 --> 38:09.870
- (Maloof) It's Ihab's voice.
- (men shouting voices on TV)

38:09.870 --> 38:11.821
We have forensic
confirmation, sir.

38:11.823 --> 38:14.450
(Ihab) "The American President

38:14.450 --> 38:17.520
of Abuddin" has waged
a holy war against Islam.

38:17.520 --> 38:20.860
Now this is a war
against the children of Islam.

38:22.660 --> 38:24.800
These are children.

38:27.938 --> 38:30.006
Can you see them?

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
(sighing)

38:33.000 --> 38:35.070
(woman shouting on TV)

38:35.079 --> 38:39.082
(Ihab) Children.

38:40.151 --> 38:43.987
These were your children.

38:55.166 --> 38:58.268
You see this?
A gun emplacement.

38:58.270 --> 38:59.436
It's been destroyed.

38:59.438 --> 39:00.637
Here.

39:00.639 --> 39:03.139
Rocket-propelled
grenade launchers.

39:03.141 --> 39:07.344
Here, warheads
and associated hardware.

39:07.346 --> 39:09.813
All of them obliterated.

39:09.815 --> 39:12.515
This was not a mistake.

39:12.517 --> 39:14.384
Was the camp
 near a school?

39:14.386 --> 39:17.120
Intelligence tells us the
nearest school was a mile away.

39:17.122 --> 39:20.724
These are children
in street clothes.

39:20.726 --> 39:22.225
Boys and girls.

39:22.227 --> 39:24.794
That's a backpack... notebooks.

39:24.796 --> 39:26.190
(Cogswell) He must have moved 
the children

39:26.290 --> 39:28.064
to the training camp
as a shield.

39:28.066 --> 39:30.233
Hideous.

39:35.406 --> 39:38.641
Mr. President.

39:38.643 --> 39:41.911
We failed,
and I apologize.

39:41.913 --> 39:43.847
It's more than a
failure, General.

39:43.849 --> 39:46.816
Those are dead children.

39:46.818 --> 39:48.250
I know that.

39:48.250 --> 39:50.553
It's horrifying.

39:50.555 --> 39:52.922
But tragedies
happen in war.

39:54.492 --> 39:57.127
The question is
what do you want to do next?

40:00.030 --> 40:02.599
(child laughing)

40:04.368 --> 40:05.735
(grunts)

40:05.737 --> 40:07.670
Not so fast, little man.

40:09.840 --> 40:13.543
Abdullah, the missile strike...

40:13.545 --> 40:16.000
I'll be more careful.

40:17.880 --> 40:20.116
They're in paradise now...

40:21.252 --> 40:22.619
and on Earth,

40:22.621 --> 40:24.750
things are exactly
where I want them to be.

40:24.750 --> 40:26.623
Upside down, upside down!

40:26.625 --> 40:28.858
Upside down, upside down.

40:30.394 --> 40:34.364
We could not have planned
it better if we tried.

40:34.366 --> 40:36.266
Upside down.

40:36.370 --> 40:38.370
(door closes)

40:43.274 --> 40:45.341
Ma'am?

40:46.277 --> 40:48.745
What?

40:48.747 --> 40:50.814
I looked through
the laundry.

40:50.816 --> 40:52.282
See?

40:52.284 --> 40:53.810
Your daughter's
towels,

40:53.810 --> 40:55.885
they were
already washed.

40:55.887 --> 40:58.250
Okay.

41:00.391 --> 41:04.561
I can't bring her
back to you, but...

41:04.563 --> 41:07.163
my grandmother was
 a naddabah.

41:07.165 --> 41:10.400
She was Druze, from Lebanon,
a poet singer.

41:10.402 --> 41:12.902
She taught me
 her funeral songs.

41:12.904 --> 41:15.772
When someone died
in her village,

41:15.774 --> 41:17.340
everyone come to sing,

41:17.342 --> 41:19.943
but you...
you mourn alone.

41:19.945 --> 41:22.011
I'll sing one for you?

41:23.247 --> 41:24.881
A prayer?
