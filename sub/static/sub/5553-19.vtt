00:03.522 --> 00:06.356
I didn't understand your e-mail.

00:06.358 --> 00:09.426
Uh, can you repeat that?
You're breaking up.

00:09.428 --> 00:12.529
I didn't understand your e-mail.

00:12.531 --> 00:15.499
Ah. Yeah, I had to get
a little creative

00:15.501 --> 00:19.937
because the S, R and M keys
on my laptop stopped working.

00:19.939 --> 00:22.940

00:28.514 --> 00:31.515
So, is that a yes?

00:31.517 --> 00:34.051
Sheldon, why don't you get
a new computer?

00:34.053 --> 00:35.986
You know that one's out-of-date.

00:35.988 --> 00:38.222
Oh, but I like this computer.

00:38.224 --> 00:41.892
The video is failing,
and the sound is cutting out.

00:41.894 --> 00:44.294
I'm sorry, I didn't get that.

00:44.296 --> 00:46.530
The video is failing,

00:46.532 --> 00:48.665
and the sound is cutting out.

00:48.667 --> 00:52.870
I'm sorry, one more time.
The sound is cutting out.

00:56.442 --> 00:57.775
I can't read that!

00:57.777 --> 00:59.910
The video is failing!

00:59.912 --> 01:03.147
Get a new computer.

01:03.149 --> 01:04.313
What?

01:04.316 --> 01:06.416
Get a new computer.

01:06.418 --> 01:08.152
What?!

01:10.890 --> 01:11.889
Hello?

01:11.891 --> 01:14.057

01:42.966 --> 01:44.365
This is cool.

01:44.367 --> 01:46.434
When was the last time you
and I built something together?

01:46.436 --> 01:49.136
Scientifically?
A little over a year ago.

01:49.138 --> 01:51.439
LEGOs? Last week in my room.

01:51.441 --> 01:53.975
If there was a Nobrize
for Millennium Falcons

01:53.977 --> 01:56.944
that fall apart when
you pick them up, we'd be set.

01:56.946 --> 01:58.224
Hey, guys!

01:58.225 --> 01:58.745
Hey.

01:58.881 --> 01:59.981
What are you doing here?

01:59.983 --> 02:01.616
We heard there were
some sexy scientists

02:01.618 --> 02:03.517
working hard all weekend.
Yeah,

02:03.519 --> 02:06.988
so we brought you some lunch and
we are gonna go look for 'em.

02:06.990 --> 02:09.023
Soup, sandwiches
and emasculation,

02:09.025 --> 02:11.259
just like my mom
used to make.

02:11.261 --> 02:12.493
So, how's it goin'?

02:12.495 --> 02:13.995
Good. Slow.

02:13.997 --> 02:15.730
There's a lot of tedious setup,
but once we get through that

02:15.732 --> 02:16.731
it should go quicker.

02:16.733 --> 02:18.466
Is there anything
we can do to help?

02:18.468 --> 02:20.601
You know what,
this part isn't that technical.

02:20.603 --> 02:21.702
You actually could.

02:21.704 --> 02:25.006
Wow, really? Called my bluff.
All righty then.

02:25.008 --> 02:27.008
Can we really help?

02:27.010 --> 02:28.509
While we finish soldering
these boards, it'd be great

02:28.511 --> 02:31.045
if you guys could wrap these
pipe fittings with Teflon tape.

02:31.047 --> 02:32.046
I'll show you
how to do one.

02:32.048 --> 02:33.681
Hey, w-wouldn't it be funny

02:33.683 --> 02:35.249
if after all your years
of hard work,

02:35.251 --> 02:38.286
I'm the one who makes
a scientific breakthrough?

02:41.624 --> 02:44.859
He doesn't think
that's funny.

02:46.000 --> 02:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:58.641 --> 03:01.008
I got here
as quickly as I could.

03:01.010 --> 03:03.311
You're too late.

03:22.165 --> 03:24.398
Sheldon, this is silly.

03:24.400 --> 03:27.735
You got emotional
when that lab monkey died.

03:27.737 --> 03:31.672
That lab monkey told me
he loved me in sign language.

03:41.918 --> 03:43.217
Great.

03:43.219 --> 03:46.554
Now I'm gonna have that song
in my head all day.

03:47.457 --> 03:48.856
Look, I'm-I'm sorry

03:48.858 --> 03:51.192
for your loss, but I think

03:51.194 --> 03:54.061
I have something
that might make you feel better.

03:54.063 --> 03:57.231
I got you a new computer!

03:58.968 --> 04:01.335
How could you do that?

04:01.337 --> 04:03.170
Do what?

04:03.172 --> 04:06.374
Choosing a new laptop is
an incredibly personal ritual.

04:06.376 --> 04:07.742
You have taken away

04:07.744 --> 04:10.611
weeks of agonizing thought,
tedious research,

04:10.613 --> 04:13.981
sleepless nights filled
with indecision. I j...

04:14.817 --> 04:16.983
Haven't I lost enough today?

04:18.286 --> 04:22.890
Well, the guy at the store said
this one is great.

04:22.892 --> 04:24.859
Oh! Oh, the guy!

04:24.861 --> 04:26.827
Oh, pardon me.

04:26.829 --> 04:28.462
I-I didn't realize
you'd spoken to the guy.

04:28.464 --> 04:30.030
Yeah, tell me,

04:30.032 --> 04:32.600
did the guy choose one
with a 4K display

04:32.602 --> 04:34.001
and a Thunderbolt port?

04:34.003 --> 04:35.202
Yes.
Yeah?

04:35.204 --> 04:36.370
D-Did the guy make sure

04:36.372 --> 04:39.140
that this has a one-terabyte
solid-state drive?

04:39.142 --> 04:40.674
Yes.
Yeah? Oh, well,

04:40.676 --> 04:43.878
was this guy Rick from
Computer Solutions on Colorado?

04:43.880 --> 04:44.845
Yes.

04:44.847 --> 04:46.213
Yeah, well,
he does know his stuff.

04:49.252 --> 04:51.085
After you wrap the body
in reflective tape,

04:51.087 --> 04:53.254
the ends get Teflon tape
so we can get a tight seal.

04:53.256 --> 04:55.389
Like this? Oh.
Yeah, perfect.

04:55.391 --> 04:57.124
And it helps to have
small, delicate fingers.

04:57.126 --> 04:58.726
So don't be discouraged
if you can't do it as fast

04:58.728 --> 05:00.361
as me and Howard.

05:01.697 --> 05:03.063
I don't know
if we have enough solder

05:03.065 --> 05:04.298
to finish
these circuit boards.

05:04.300 --> 05:05.529
We had a full spool yesterday.

05:05.530 --> 05:06.331
What can I say,

05:06.335 --> 05:08.936
I play hard,
I solder even harder.

05:10.506 --> 05:12.506
Sometimes he solders at home
with his shirt off.

05:12.508 --> 05:14.508
It's like a beer commercial.

05:17.213 --> 05:19.213
Well, we got to make a run
to the hardware store.

05:19.215 --> 05:21.515
How can you call yourself a
scientist and run out of solder?

05:21.517 --> 05:24.318
Well, funny story.
So, we have plenty

05:24.320 --> 05:26.253
of the 60/40
tin-to-lead ratio solder,

05:26.255 --> 05:28.915
but the spools look a lot
like the 63/37 tin-to...

05:28.916 --> 05:29.555
Honey, honey,

05:29.559 --> 05:32.960
honey, let me stop you.
That is-is not a funny story.

05:34.096 --> 05:35.830
You want to come with us?

05:35.832 --> 05:37.355
I'm kind of getting
into the groove here.

05:37.356 --> 05:37.976
Yeah, you guys run

05:38.000 --> 05:40.821
to the store and let the women
handle the science for a change.

05:40.822 --> 05:41.500
Okay.

05:41.504 --> 05:43.537
We'll be back
as soon as we can.

05:43.539 --> 05:46.807
Okay, so what...

05:46.809 --> 05:49.009
is solder?

05:51.180 --> 05:54.148
I suppose I should
set this up.

05:54.150 --> 05:57.785
Or would you like
to rob me of that, too?

05:57.787 --> 06:00.754
Knock it off or I'll start
making W-H sounds

06:00.756 --> 06:03.791
for words
that just have a W.

06:03.793 --> 06:04.425
You wouldn't.

06:04.427 --> 06:07.761
"Hwatch" me.

06:08.664 --> 06:10.064
Fine. I'm sorry.

06:10.066 --> 06:11.932
Thank you for
the thoughtful gift.

06:11.934 --> 06:13.534
I really do appreciate it.

06:13.536 --> 06:17.938
As you know, I had become
attached to my old laptop.

06:17.940 --> 06:19.473
But I'm sure, in time,
that this one will...

06:19.475 --> 06:21.408
Jeepers creepers,

06:21.410 --> 06:23.611
that started up fast!

06:23.613 --> 06:25.646
I thought you might
like it.

06:25.648 --> 06:27.848
Look at the 4K resolution.

06:27.850 --> 06:29.617
Next time we Skype,
I'm gonna count

06:29.619 --> 06:32.620
all those nostril hairs.

06:32.622 --> 06:35.256
Or you could just look
into my eyes.

06:35.258 --> 06:37.358
But you only have two eyes.

06:37.360 --> 06:40.494
You got a lot of nostril hairs.

06:40.496 --> 06:42.987
Well, you know,
as long as you're happy.

06:43.011 --> 06:44.533
Oh.

06:44.534 --> 06:46.000
I am.

06:46.002 --> 06:48.636
And Rick said you could bring in
your old one to recycle it.

06:48.638 --> 06:51.539
Oh. Uh, no, no, no, thank you.

06:51.541 --> 06:53.140
Oh, but he said
you can get store credit.

06:53.142 --> 06:55.809
Well, no, I just...
I-I don't want to recycle it.

06:55.811 --> 06:57.411
And I don't want store credit.

06:57.413 --> 06:58.312
But why wouldn't...

06:58.314 --> 07:00.147
Can we please change
the subject?

07:00.149 --> 07:02.716
O-Okay.

07:02.718 --> 07:06.053
How 'bout we change it to why
you're being weird about this?

07:06.055 --> 07:07.154
I'm not being weird.

07:07.156 --> 07:09.390
I...

07:09.392 --> 07:11.392
It's hard to explain.

07:11.394 --> 07:15.296
Sheldon, just tell me.

07:16.165 --> 07:18.198
It might be easier to show you.

07:18.200 --> 07:20.367
Okay.

07:21.237 --> 07:23.804
We'd have to take your car.

07:23.806 --> 07:25.973
All right.

07:28.344 --> 07:31.979
And I'm gonna need you to sign
a nondisclosure agreement.

07:32.949 --> 07:36.317
Well, I signed one
before we slept together.

07:36.319 --> 07:38.485
Why not now?

07:42.525 --> 07:45.392
Penny says they're having fun
working on the prototype.

07:45.394 --> 07:49.063
Remember when her fun was
nightclubs and drinking games?

07:49.065 --> 07:51.699
I know. I'm lowering
the bar so slowly.

07:51.701 --> 07:54.835
This time next year
she'll have a coin collection.

07:54.837 --> 07:56.236
Excuse me.

07:56.238 --> 07:58.505
You guys interested in a free
screening of an upcoming movie?

07:58.507 --> 07:59.406
Oh. Sorry, we can't.

07:59.408 --> 08:01.375
Well, hang on.
What movie is it?

08:01.377 --> 08:04.178
Oh, I can't tell you.
But it does star Will Smith.

08:04.180 --> 08:06.046
Wait.

08:06.048 --> 08:07.481
I bet it's <i>Suicide Squad.</i>

08:07.483 --> 08:09.283
Let's check it out.

08:09.285 --> 08:10.484
What about the girls?

08:10.486 --> 08:12.286
Penny just said
they're having fun.

08:12.288 --> 08:14.822
Honestly, you want to wrap tape
around a bunch of pipe fittings

08:14.824 --> 08:16.290
all afternoon?

08:17.259 --> 08:18.492
Okay, we'll take 'em.

08:18.494 --> 08:20.327
Okay.
But, I swear,

08:20.329 --> 08:22.329
if it's Will Smith
in <i>Shark Tale 2,</i>

08:22.331 --> 08:25.699
it better be at least as good
as the original.

08:26.936 --> 08:28.602
I mean, it's crazy,
isn't it?

08:28.604 --> 08:30.738
I moved here from Nebraska
to be an actress,

08:30.740 --> 08:33.707
and now I'm sitting
in an engineering lab at Caltech

08:33.708 --> 08:37.910
helping to build a prototype
for a high-tech guidance system.

08:37.913 --> 08:39.913
It is crazy. It's also crazy

08:39.914 --> 08:43.417
that I've made 14 of these
and you've made three.

08:46.355 --> 08:48.822
Hey. Where are the guys?

08:48.824 --> 08:50.224
Oh, they went to the store
to get solder,

08:50.226 --> 08:53.827
which is metal you melt
to make science things.

08:54.730 --> 08:56.330
Since when
do you work on weekends?

08:56.332 --> 08:57.831
I'm an astrophysicist.

08:57.833 --> 09:00.100
The stars don't take a day off.

09:00.102 --> 09:02.903
You were home alone
and had no one to play with?

09:02.905 --> 09:06.173
Well, the cleaning lady was
there, but she doesn't like me.

09:07.343 --> 09:08.709
You need any help?

09:08.711 --> 09:11.345
Not with
Lightning McQueen here.

09:11.347 --> 09:13.080
I think we're good.

09:13.082 --> 09:14.648
Okay. That's cool.

09:14.650 --> 09:16.984
I guess everybody's involved
in this project but me.

09:16.986 --> 09:19.753
So... see ya.

09:22.425 --> 09:23.457
I feel bad.

09:23.459 --> 09:24.525
Should we have asked him
to stay?

09:24.527 --> 09:26.694
Yes.

09:29.865 --> 09:32.266
Will you please tell me
where we're going?

09:32.268 --> 09:35.936
Sorry, you're on
a need-to-know basis.

09:36.872 --> 09:38.172
I'm driving the car.

09:38.174 --> 09:40.541
I need to know.

09:40.543 --> 09:41.608
Right.

09:41.610 --> 09:43.310
So where are we going?

09:43.312 --> 09:46.814
No, I meant turn right,
and you missed it.

09:46.816 --> 09:49.483
Maybe you do need to know.

09:53.823 --> 09:55.022
What are we gonna tell
the girls?

09:55.024 --> 09:56.190
It's not a problem.

09:56.192 --> 09:57.324
I mean without lying.

09:57.326 --> 09:59.693
And now you've made it
a problem.

09:59.695 --> 10:01.762
Come on. We're
a couple of smart guys.

10:01.764 --> 10:03.630
I'm sure we can come up
with a way to explain this

10:03.632 --> 10:05.299
that doesn't make us
look bad.

10:07.169 --> 10:09.103
Oh!

10:09.105 --> 10:10.904
The boys had to drive
all the way to San Bernardino

10:10.906 --> 10:12.740
for the solder and got a flat.

10:15.845 --> 10:18.245
They bought it.

10:18.247 --> 10:19.813
But we're gonna have to

10:19.815 --> 10:21.448
put the spare on
before we go back.

10:21.450 --> 10:23.150
Oh, you're good at this.

10:23.152 --> 10:25.486
Well, I lie a lot.

10:26.322 --> 10:27.988
Hey, guys, thank you

10:27.990 --> 10:29.923
for being a part of our
test screening. You're about

10:29.925 --> 10:32.626
to be one of the first audiences
to see <i>Suicide Squad.</i>

10:32.628 --> 10:34.595
Hey!

10:34.597 --> 10:35.863
You were right.

10:35.865 --> 10:36.997
Oh, I keep telling you--

10:36.999 --> 10:40.534
good things happen
to bad people.

10:40.536 --> 10:42.569
Uh, we're gonna get started
in a couple minutes. Enjoy.

10:42.571 --> 10:44.638
Who are you texting?

10:44.640 --> 10:47.074
Raj. He really wants
to see this movie.

10:47.076 --> 10:49.042
Oh, he'll never
make it in time.

10:49.044 --> 10:51.912
I know.
I want to make him feel bad.

10:53.282 --> 10:56.750
"Ha, ha. Leonard and I are
about to see <i>Suicide Squad.</i>

10:56.752 --> 11:00.587
Spoiler alert: when I see you
I'm gonna spoil it."

11:00.589 --> 11:02.456
You're a good friend.

11:10.099 --> 11:12.432
Okay.

11:13.569 --> 11:18.238
Would you ladies please
leave the room for a moment?

11:18.240 --> 11:20.174
Why?

11:20.176 --> 11:24.144
I need to rub my genitals
on their prototype.

11:24.146 --> 11:26.446
What's going on?

11:26.448 --> 11:28.816
Leonard and Howard
don't have a flat.

11:28.818 --> 11:31.018
They went to the movies. Look.

11:31.954 --> 11:33.687
Son of a bitch.
Un-freakin' believable.

11:33.689 --> 11:35.956
Oh. You know what?
I'm gonna let them know

11:35.958 --> 11:38.258
that I'm here with you
and that they're busted.

11:38.260 --> 11:39.560
No. You know what? Don't. Don't.

11:39.562 --> 11:41.061
Let's let them think
they're getting away with it.

11:41.063 --> 11:44.131
Yeah, let's see how deep a hole
they can dig for themselves.

11:44.133 --> 11:45.599
Mm-hmm.
Interesting.

11:45.601 --> 11:47.734
I mean, it's not testicles
on a cryostat,

11:47.736 --> 11:49.937
but I like it.

11:58.121 --> 12:00.288
Why do you have
a storage unit?

12:00.290 --> 12:02.257
Just wait.

12:02.259 --> 12:04.359
How long have you had it?

12:05.996 --> 12:07.195
Just wait.

12:07.732 --> 12:09.932
Do you want me to hold
that computer?

12:09.934 --> 12:12.768
Just wai... You know what?
Actually, yes, thank you.

12:20.711 --> 12:24.013
Welcome to my Fortress of Shame.

12:29.053 --> 12:30.286
I'm sorry.

12:30.288 --> 12:32.588
What-what am I looking at?

12:32.590 --> 12:35.925
It's basically everything
I've ever owned.

12:35.927 --> 12:38.727
Um, every book,

12:38.729 --> 12:42.731
every T-shirt, every piece
of broken electronics.

12:42.733 --> 12:45.901
Just... all of it.

12:48.806 --> 12:51.407
All of it?

12:51.409 --> 12:53.309
I have a Ziploc bag

12:53.311 --> 12:56.479
filled with all
my old Ziploc bags.

13:02.453 --> 13:05.187
Okay.

13:05.189 --> 13:07.256
Well...

13:07.258 --> 13:09.325
I would like to tell you

13:09.327 --> 13:12.094
that there is

13:12.096 --> 13:16.065
nothing here to be ashamed of.

13:17.301 --> 13:19.468
So I'm gonna need a minute.

13:24.275 --> 13:27.176
All right, how are we gonna
play this when they return?

13:27.178 --> 13:28.644
I know.

13:28.646 --> 13:31.814
You guys should totally
be making out with me.

13:33.951 --> 13:36.352
Sweetie, I know you think
jokes like that are funny,

13:36.354 --> 13:38.087
but do you really think
you could handle

13:38.089 --> 13:39.522
making out with both of us?

13:41.192 --> 13:42.525
No, ma'am.

13:45.129 --> 13:47.530
Okay. Okay,
how about this?

13:47.532 --> 13:48.631
They don't know
you're here with us,

13:48.633 --> 13:50.866
so you hide in the closet.
When they show up,

13:50.868 --> 13:52.434
we'll hear
whatever their dumb story is

13:52.436 --> 13:54.270
about where they were,
we'll pretend to believe them,

13:54.272 --> 13:57.006
and just when they think they
got away with it, you jump out.

13:57.008 --> 13:58.908
Yeah, that's pretty good.
I love it!

13:58.910 --> 14:01.143
I'll be all like, "Busted!"

14:01.145 --> 14:02.611
And they'll be like, "What?!"

14:02.613 --> 14:05.648
And then we'll all be like,
"Oh, <i>yeah!"</i>

14:07.051 --> 14:08.384
Yeah, I-I get it.

14:08.386 --> 14:10.586
I wouldn't make out
with me, either.

14:12.924 --> 14:15.891
In here is every clock radio
I've ever owned.

14:15.893 --> 14:17.793
Calculators, VHS tapes.

14:17.795 --> 14:19.195
Yeah. Oh.

14:19.197 --> 14:21.397
Sporting equipment.

14:23.401 --> 14:25.634
Y-You have sporting equipment?

14:25.636 --> 14:27.970
Well, oh, it's just a...
it's a... a golf ball

14:27.972 --> 14:29.972
that my brother
threw at my head.

14:29.974 --> 14:32.741
You can still
feel the dent.

14:32.743 --> 14:36.011
It's right next to
the hockey puck dent.

14:38.382 --> 14:40.950
Okay, why do you have
a bin of pinecones?

14:40.952 --> 14:43.385
I used to collect
them as a child.

14:43.387 --> 14:45.688
The spiral of scales open in

14:45.690 --> 14:47.423
the Fibonacci sequence.

14:47.425 --> 14:49.325
A fact that,
when you tell your brother,

14:49.327 --> 14:52.261
gets a golf ball
thrown at your head.

14:54.565 --> 14:59.134
So, why do you feel
you need to save these things?

14:59.136 --> 15:01.370
I'd like to say it's nostalgia,

15:01.372 --> 15:04.440
but every time I think
of throwing anything away,

15:04.442 --> 15:06.008
my ears start to ring,

15:06.010 --> 15:08.210
and I get butterflies
in my stomach.

15:08.212 --> 15:09.678
And then it feels like

15:09.680 --> 15:11.880
the butterflies
get eaten by rats,

15:11.882 --> 15:14.116
and then, the-the rats
get eaten by...

15:14.118 --> 15:15.084
Okay.

15:15.086 --> 15:16.719
I get it. I get it.

15:16.721 --> 15:19.622
It ends with dinosaurs.

15:21.659 --> 15:24.426
I'm sorry
if you think less of me.

15:25.329 --> 15:27.263
I don't.

15:27.265 --> 15:29.064
Really?

15:29.066 --> 15:31.066
'Cause every time
I come in here,

15:31.068 --> 15:32.968
I think less of me.

15:32.970 --> 15:34.336
Why?

15:34.338 --> 15:36.171
Because I'm a fraud.

15:36.173 --> 15:37.606
No. I purport

15:37.608 --> 15:39.441
to be a man of the mind.

15:39.443 --> 15:43.178
I've been such a-a vocal
champion of The Singularity,

15:43.180 --> 15:45.014
but how can I leave
my body behind

15:45.016 --> 15:47.283
and become one
with the Internet

15:47.285 --> 15:49.985
when I've never even thrown
a toothbrush away?

15:52.189 --> 15:53.989
It's okay, Sheldon.

15:53.991 --> 15:57.426
You know, I... I've saved
a lot of weird things, too.

15:57.428 --> 15:59.628
Like what?

15:59.630 --> 16:01.563
Well, um,

16:01.565 --> 16:04.967
did you know
I have a microscope slide

16:04.969 --> 16:06.402
with a little bit of tissue

16:06.404 --> 16:09.405
from the first brain
I ever dissected?

16:09.407 --> 16:11.607
I have an old teddy bear

16:11.609 --> 16:14.209
I secretly wiped my nose on
for years.

16:21.118 --> 16:23.686
It's not a contest.

16:25.956 --> 16:28.524
Okay, here they come.
Go hide.

16:28.526 --> 16:30.592
Oh, man, when I come out
of the closet,

16:30.594 --> 16:33.195
I'm gonna nail those guys!

16:35.299 --> 16:37.299
Yeah, I heard it. Shut up.

16:42.740 --> 16:44.039
Hey.
Hi.

16:44.041 --> 16:46.075
Hey, what's this?

16:46.077 --> 16:48.010
Listen, we did a stupid thing.

16:48.012 --> 16:51.814
We went to a movie and
lied about it, but we feel bad

16:51.816 --> 16:53.515
and want to make it up
to you.

16:53.517 --> 16:55.284
So, these are for you,
and if you're not too mad,

16:55.286 --> 16:56.511
we'd love to take
you guys to dinner.

16:56.512 --> 16:57.040
Yeah.

16:57.054 --> 16:59.455
Anywhere you want.
Oh. Well,

16:59.457 --> 17:01.557
- thank you for being honest.
- Yeah. You know,

17:01.559 --> 17:03.025
I want to be upset, but we did

17:03.027 --> 17:04.492
kind of have fun
working on the prototype.

17:04.494 --> 17:06.662
Don't forgive them!
Stay mad at them!

17:08.065 --> 17:10.132
What is he doing
in there?

17:10.134 --> 17:13.268
Busting you!

17:14.538 --> 17:15.938
It's okay.
They apologized.

17:15.940 --> 17:17.106
Yeah, it's fine.

17:17.108 --> 17:21.242
Well this is kind
of anti-climactic.

17:22.246 --> 17:23.846
You know what
wasn't anti-climactic?

17:23.848 --> 17:25.547
The end of the movie. Get this.

17:25.549 --> 17:27.616
No spoilers! No spoilers!

17:28.486 --> 17:30.652
And he's back
in the closet.

17:32.022 --> 17:34.590
Ready for dinner?

17:34.592 --> 17:36.792
Yeah.

17:38.796 --> 17:40.529
Should we invite Raj?

17:40.531 --> 17:42.865
Yes.

17:45.035 --> 17:47.302
So, no one else knows
about this?

17:47.304 --> 17:49.505
Only you.

17:51.108 --> 17:53.709
Thank you for trusting me.

17:53.711 --> 17:55.711
What good is having
a girlfriend

17:55.713 --> 17:58.447
if you can't unload your
psychological sewage on her?

17:59.850 --> 18:02.451
That's me,
your emotional outhouse.

18:04.188 --> 18:06.088
You know,

18:06.090 --> 18:09.758
if you ever decide you want
to do something about this,

18:09.760 --> 18:11.427
I'm-I'm here for you.

18:11.429 --> 18:13.695
Thank you.

18:13.697 --> 18:15.998
I wouldn't even know
how to begin.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.634
Baby steps, I guess.

18:18.636 --> 18:21.103
Mm.

18:27.578 --> 18:30.712
I suppose I could try
getting rid of the golf ball.

18:31.515 --> 18:33.449
Oh. Okay.

18:34.452 --> 18:37.286
I will always have the dent
to remember it by.

18:52.937 --> 18:54.636
You did it.

18:54.638 --> 18:56.839
Do you feel okay?

18:57.875 --> 19:00.042
Actually, yes.

19:01.245 --> 19:02.678
I do.

19:03.581 --> 19:05.380
Well, I'm proud of you.

19:05.382 --> 19:07.583
Oh. Thanks.

19:24.565 --> 19:28.300
I'm glad I told you
about the storage unit.

19:28.302 --> 19:30.202
Well, I feel closer to you now.

19:30.857 --> 19:33.024
Oh, I feel closer to you, too.

19:33.026 --> 19:34.292
You know,

19:34.294 --> 19:37.929
it's still a couple
of hours until my bedtime.

19:44.704 --> 19:47.338
What did you have in mind?

19:47.340 --> 19:49.774
You look amazing.

19:53.246 --> 19:57.815
I mean,
this resolution is remarkable.

19:58.752 --> 20:02.287
I really had to go home
for this?

20:02.289 --> 20:06.624
Yes, but it's like
you're right here in the room.

20:06.626 --> 20:09.727
And yet, I'm not.

20:09.729 --> 20:13.298
But I feel like I could
reach out and touch you.

20:13.300 --> 20:15.466
And yet, you can't.

20:17.270 --> 20:19.137
I know!
