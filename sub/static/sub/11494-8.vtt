WEBVTT

01:57.003 --> 01:59.070
<i>My son.</i>

02:00.540 --> 02:02.606
My firstborn son.

02:05.978 --> 02:09.547
My child king, hush.

02:11.818 --> 02:14.618
Listen to the gods, for you they sing.

02:18.658 --> 02:20.324
Fight no more, sweet child.

02:20.426 --> 02:22.460
Your wars are won.

02:24.097 --> 02:26.464
The wolves are buried

02:26.566 --> 02:28.866
and the false stag done.

02:33.239 --> 02:35.439
Shut your blue eyes, my love.

02:35.541 --> 02:37.074
Let the crown fall.

02:37.176 --> 02:39.777
The Father above
beckons you to his hall.

02:41.614 --> 02:44.715
In Seventh Heaven
I'll see you once more.

02:48.454 --> 02:53.090
But now I seek vengeance
on Sansa the whore

02:53.192 --> 02:55.926
and my brother the Imp

02:56.028 --> 02:58.829
who killed his own king.

02:58.931 --> 03:01.599
Born amongst lions,
our curse from within.

03:01.701 --> 03:03.968
I will slay him, I swear.

03:04.070 --> 03:06.637
With noose or with knife,

03:06.739 --> 03:09.340
though it take me a fortnight,

03:09.442 --> 03:12.977
a moon or my life.

03:37.537 --> 03:39.937
<i>What is that
I hear and smell?</i>

03:40.039 --> 03:43.340
<i>Someone I'll soon send to hell.</i>

03:43.442 --> 03:46.076
<i>It's time to see if truth they told</i>

03:46.179 --> 03:49.013
<i>who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.</i>

03:49.115 --> 03:50.848
<i>Get the wig!</i>

03:50.950 --> 03:54.618
<i>You beast, you beast.
You killed my wife.</i>

03:54.720 --> 03:57.888
<i>And now you've taken
your father's life.</i>

03:57.990 --> 04:01.125
<i>No worse child
ever stained this land.</i>

04:01.227 --> 04:04.461
<i>I curse the day I named you.</i>

04:06.833 --> 04:09.733
<i>My greatest crime!</i>

04:41.467 --> 04:43.167
You're good at that.

04:43.269 --> 04:45.736
Where did you learn?

04:45.838 --> 04:47.471
I'm a jealous woman.

04:47.573 --> 04:49.874
I've always liked bad men

04:49.976 --> 04:52.076
and they've always liked me.

04:53.913 --> 04:56.647
They'd come home wherever
home was that night

04:56.749 --> 05:00.951
stinking of some whore's perfume.

05:01.053 --> 05:03.888
So we'd fight and I'd
put a hole in them.

05:03.990 --> 05:06.724
And then I'd feel terrible,

05:06.826 --> 05:08.792
so I'd patch them up.

05:08.895 --> 05:10.294
<i>I got good at patching them up.</i>

05:10.396 --> 05:12.029
And good at putting holes in them.

05:12.131 --> 05:14.365
And that.

05:17.203 --> 05:19.436
What happened to the actress?

05:19.538 --> 05:22.640
<i>The one who wanted you dead.</i>

05:22.742 --> 05:24.375
Bianca.

05:24.477 --> 05:27.011
She'll have a hard time
finding work as an actress

05:27.113 --> 05:29.146
after what I did to her face.

05:34.387 --> 05:35.586
Mmm.

05:35.688 --> 05:37.755
I never did learn to cook.

05:37.857 --> 05:40.424
But eat.
Eat. You need it.

05:42.528 --> 05:45.396
The company is moving
on to Pentos soon.

05:45.498 --> 05:47.031
You should come with us.

05:47.133 --> 05:49.166
- I can't.
- Why not?

05:49.268 --> 05:51.702
Got a feeling you'd be
good at this sort of work.

05:51.804 --> 05:53.871
And besides, we need a new actress.

05:53.973 --> 05:57.708
I don't think I could
remember all of the lines.

05:57.810 --> 06:00.210
Come with us.

06:00.313 --> 06:02.279
What's left for you here?

06:03.449 --> 06:06.216
You wouldn't be safe.

06:06.319 --> 06:09.119
Not while she's looking for me.

06:09.221 --> 06:11.355
<i>Who?</i>

06:11.457 --> 06:13.023
She doesn't have a name.

06:18.698 --> 06:20.264
Where will you go?

06:23.102 --> 06:26.637
Essos is east and Westeros is west.

06:26.739 --> 06:28.706
But what's west of Westeros?

06:30.109 --> 06:31.175
I don't know.

06:31.277 --> 06:32.843
Nobody does.

06:32.945 --> 06:35.045
<i>That's where all the maps stop.</i>

06:35.147 --> 06:37.081
The edge of the world, maybe.

06:37.183 --> 06:38.482
<i>I'd like to see that.</i>

06:49.395 --> 06:51.562
- What's that?
- Milk of the poppy.

06:51.664 --> 06:53.230
I don't want any.

06:55.401 --> 06:58.535
Sleep is the only way you'll heal.

06:58.637 --> 07:02.473
Trust me, if my soup didn't
kill you, nothing will.

07:44.817 --> 07:48.185
Thing about Gatins, right,
is he used to be pretty.

07:48.287 --> 07:49.620
I was a famous kisser.

07:49.722 --> 07:52.289
You lads know how to kiss proper?

07:54.326 --> 07:55.459
Course we do.

07:55.561 --> 07:58.095
This is for masters, this technique.

07:58.197 --> 08:00.030
- You're not ready.
- I'm ready.

08:00.132 --> 08:02.533
He says he's ready.

08:02.635 --> 08:05.636
All right.
Now, pay attention.

08:08.107 --> 08:11.742
You put your left hand on the
back of the lady's head.

08:11.844 --> 08:15.145
Your right hand holds the small
of the lady's back like so.

08:16.315 --> 08:17.648
Very romantic.

08:17.750 --> 08:20.751
Take your middle finger, yeah,

08:20.853 --> 08:22.953
and you jam it right up her bunghole.

08:25.958 --> 08:27.357
<i>So fucking close!</i>

08:27.460 --> 08:30.094
Ah, it smells like pussy to me.

08:30.196 --> 08:31.795
Look at him.
You get hard, boy?

08:31.897 --> 08:34.965
Fuck you!
Disgusting old twats.

08:38.703 --> 08:41.438
Got off on that,
did you, you old fuck?

09:03.362 --> 09:04.895
Where's the other one?

09:04.997 --> 09:07.531
- The one with the yellow cloak.
- Fuck you!

09:07.633 --> 09:09.933
Those are your last words, fuck you?

09:10.035 --> 09:11.902
Come on, you can do better.

09:12.004 --> 09:13.370
Cunt!

09:13.472 --> 09:15.939
You're shit at dying, you know that?

09:31.239 --> 09:34.825
From the fire she was reborn
to remake the world.

09:34.909 --> 09:40.164
Daenerys is a gift from the Lord of Light
to her children.

09:40.248 --> 09:44.585
If we are steadfast in our love for the
Queen and her faithful advisors,

09:44.669 --> 09:48.673
no man will ever lock us in chains again.

09:50.341 --> 09:52.176
I'd call that a successful gambit.

09:52.278 --> 09:54.077
- Would you?
- Look around.

09:54.180 --> 09:56.280
The city has come back to life.

09:56.382 --> 10:00.050
- You made a pact with fanatics.
- I did and it worked.

10:00.152 --> 10:03.921
If you shaved your beard with a straight
razor, you'd say the razor worked.

10:04.023 --> 10:06.190
That doesn't mean
it won't cut your throat.

10:06.292 --> 10:09.526
Spoken like a man who has
never had to shave.

10:14.266 --> 10:15.999
I'm going to miss you.

10:16.101 --> 10:17.701
I know.

10:17.803 --> 10:20.804
I hope you're right about
this expedition of yours.

10:20.906 --> 10:24.174
If I don't return,
you'll know I was wrong.

10:27.947 --> 10:29.680
We need friends in Westeros.

10:29.782 --> 10:31.348
And we need ships.

10:31.450 --> 10:32.983
Most of all, we need our queen.

10:33.085 --> 10:36.553
She'll come back.
She has to.

10:36.655 --> 10:39.356
My heart's been broken
too many times already.

10:41.427 --> 10:43.894
I'll walk the rest of the way myself.

10:43.996 --> 10:45.596
I can't go off on a secret mission

10:45.698 --> 10:48.298
in the company of the most
famous dwarf in the city.

10:51.904 --> 10:54.171
Varys.

10:54.273 --> 10:57.274
The most famous dwarf in the world.

11:25.437 --> 11:27.871
Your Grace, several members
of the Faith Militant

11:27.973 --> 11:30.641
have been permitted
entry to the Red Keep.

11:30.743 --> 11:32.976
Have been permitted?

11:33.078 --> 11:35.212
That's rather a tortured
way of putting it.

11:35.314 --> 11:37.848
They demand to see you, Your Grace.

11:37.950 --> 11:39.983
Who permitted them
inside the Red Keep?

11:43.489 --> 11:45.522
The king is aware of their presence?

11:45.624 --> 11:47.057
<i>He is, Your Grace.</i>

11:47.159 --> 11:49.860
He's currently in his
chambers at prayer.

12:05.377 --> 12:07.577
Your Grace, His Holiness
the High Septon

12:07.680 --> 12:10.380
wishes to speak with you at
the Great Sept of Baelor.

12:10.482 --> 12:12.115
His Holiness the High Septon

12:12.217 --> 12:15.085
is welcome to see me
here in the Red Keep.

12:15.187 --> 12:17.654
Your Grace, this is not a request.

12:17.756 --> 12:19.956
It is a request, Cousin Lancel.

12:20.059 --> 12:22.659
You are asking me for
something, I'm refusing.

12:24.463 --> 12:27.597
The High Septon commands you.

12:27.700 --> 12:29.800
<i>Are you sure you want to refuse him?</i>

12:32.137 --> 12:35.205
He promised me I could stay in
the Red Keep until my trial.

12:35.307 --> 12:37.240
He made no such promises.

12:37.343 --> 12:39.366
If you refuse to come of your
own free will...

12:39.486 --> 12:40.607
Get out.

12:50.422 --> 12:52.022
Move aside, ser.

12:55.294 --> 12:58.228
Order your man to step aside
or there will be violence.

13:05.838 --> 13:07.504
I choose violence.

13:48.714 --> 13:52.249
Please tell His High Holiness
he's always welcome to visit.

14:03.829 --> 14:06.096
Looks like a siege, my lady.

14:06.198 --> 14:09.566
You have a keen military mind, Pod.

14:18.744 --> 14:21.411
My lady.
My lady.

14:24.783 --> 14:27.117
Who goes there?!

14:27.219 --> 14:28.452
State your business!

14:28.554 --> 14:30.587
My name is Brienne of Tarth.

14:30.689 --> 14:34.524
Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister
I've come to speak with him.

14:36.462 --> 14:39.429
Tell him I have his sword.

14:50.609 --> 14:52.876
Getting a bit old
to be a squire, aren't we?

14:58.317 --> 14:59.583
Podrick fucking Payne.

14:59.685 --> 15:02.285
I thought you'd be dead by now.

15:02.387 --> 15:03.787
Not yet.

15:05.491 --> 15:07.557
- Are they in there?
- Uh-huh.

15:11.430 --> 15:13.530
You think they're fucking?

15:13.632 --> 15:15.165
What?

15:15.267 --> 15:16.867
No.

15:16.969 --> 15:19.836
Why not?
I'd fuck her.

15:19.938 --> 15:21.571
You'd fuck her, wouldn't you?

15:21.673 --> 15:23.974
- I'm her squire.
- Oh.

15:24.076 --> 15:27.277
Well, he'd fuck her, that's for sure.

15:27.379 --> 15:29.346
And she'd fuck him, don't you think?

15:29.448 --> 15:31.281
The way she looks at him.

15:31.383 --> 15:33.884
The way all women look at
him is frankly irritating.

15:33.986 --> 15:37.087
I preferred working with the
little brother on that account.

15:37.189 --> 15:40.924
Come on, you're the one
with the magic cock.

15:42.327 --> 15:44.427
You must have shown it to her by now.

15:46.465 --> 15:49.165
- She's training me to fight.
- Is she?

15:49.268 --> 15:51.701
- Oh.
- An hour in the morning, an hour at night.

15:51.803 --> 15:53.603
Every day.

15:53.705 --> 15:57.507
Then how come an old cunt like me
can still sneak up and murder you?

15:57.609 --> 16:00.143
Well, that's a different
sort of fighting.

16:00.245 --> 16:01.845
Now, that's the truth, isn't it?

16:01.947 --> 16:04.514
<i>You want to learn
that sort of fighting?</i>

16:05.884 --> 16:07.717
All right.

16:07.819 --> 16:10.086
All right, let's start
with your footwork.

16:10.188 --> 16:12.389
Show me your stance.

16:13.825 --> 16:15.392
Now listen to me, Pod.

16:15.494 --> 16:18.161
See how your feet
are about a yard apart?

16:18.263 --> 16:21.064
Lesson number one, assume
everyone wants to hit you.

16:21.166 --> 16:25.268
'Cause they do, Pod. Everyone
wants to hit a fucking squire.

16:25.370 --> 16:27.971
Do it again.
Come on, don't sulk.

16:28.073 --> 16:29.673
<i>I never thought you'd find her.</i>

16:29.775 --> 16:31.207
<i>I just assumed Sansa was dead.</i>

16:31.310 --> 16:33.410
Why would you assume that?

16:33.512 --> 16:37.447
In my experience, girls like
her don't live very long.

16:37.549 --> 16:40.183
I don't think you know
many girls like her.

16:40.285 --> 16:43.219
Well, I'm proud of you.

16:43.322 --> 16:45.922
<i>I am. You fulfilled your
oath to Catelyn Stark</i>

16:46.024 --> 16:47.791
<i>against all odds.</i>

16:47.893 --> 16:50.860
Of course, my sister
wants Sansa dead.

16:50.963 --> 16:53.563
The girl is still a suspect
in Joffrey's murder,

16:53.665 --> 16:57.400
so there is that complication.

16:59.171 --> 17:00.491
What the hell are you doing here?

17:00.539 --> 17:02.272
I've come for the Blackfish.

17:02.374 --> 17:04.174
You're welcome to have him.

17:04.276 --> 17:08.044
Lady Sansa desires to take her
ancestral seat back from the Boltons

17:08.146 --> 17:11.314
and assume her rightful
position as Lady of Winterfell.

17:11.415 --> 17:14.483
With what army does she
plan on taking Winterfell?

17:14.586 --> 17:15.952
The Tully army.

17:16.054 --> 17:17.787
They're a bit occupied at the moment.

17:17.888 --> 17:19.556
I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun

17:19.657 --> 17:21.391
currently defended
by the Tully rebels,

17:21.492 --> 17:23.193
so you can see the conundrum.

17:23.295 --> 17:25.395
The Tullys are rebels because
they're fighting for their home?

17:25.497 --> 17:27.931
Riverrun was granted to
the Freys by royal decree.

17:28.032 --> 17:31.534
As a reward for betraying Robb
Stark and slaughtering his family.

17:31.637 --> 17:33.036
Exactly.

17:37.009 --> 17:38.675
We shouldn't argue about politics.

17:38.777 --> 17:41.511
You're a knight, Ser Jaime.

17:41.613 --> 17:43.580
I know there is honor in you.

17:43.682 --> 17:46.449
- I've seen it myself.
- I'm a Lannister.

17:46.551 --> 17:48.451
Don't ask me to betray my own house.

17:48.553 --> 17:50.820
I do no such thing.

17:50.922 --> 17:53.490
Take Riverrun without bloodshed.

17:53.592 --> 17:57.127
Ride south again with your mission
complete and your army intact.

17:57.229 --> 17:58.828
What do you propose?

17:58.930 --> 18:02.599
Allow me to enter Riverrun
under a flag of truce.

18:02.701 --> 18:05.035
Let me try to persuade the
Blackfish to give up the castle.

18:05.137 --> 18:07.137
Why would he abandon
his ancestral home?

18:07.239 --> 18:10.840
Because you'll allow him to lead
the Tully forces safely north.

18:13.845 --> 18:15.712
Have you ever met the Blackfish?

18:17.783 --> 18:20.617
- No.
- He's even more stubborn than you are.

18:20.719 --> 18:22.786
All right.

18:22.888 --> 18:25.288
Try to talk some sense
into the old goat.

18:25.390 --> 18:27.691
He won't listen, but his men might.

18:27.793 --> 18:30.260
Not everybody wants to die
for someone else's home.

18:30.362 --> 18:32.395
I need your word.

18:33.765 --> 18:35.632
If I persuade him
to abandon the castle,

18:35.734 --> 18:38.168
you'll grant a safe passage north.

18:38.270 --> 18:40.470
You have my word.

18:40.572 --> 18:42.505
You have until nightfall.

18:59.424 --> 19:02.092
You gave it to me for a purpose.

19:02.194 --> 19:05.395
I've achieved that purpose.

19:08.200 --> 19:09.866
It's yours.

19:11.603 --> 19:13.603
It will always be yours.

19:22.914 --> 19:24.914
One last thing, Ser Jaime.

19:25.016 --> 19:27.150
Yes, Lady Brienne?

19:27.252 --> 19:31.187
Should I fail to persuade
the Blackfish to surrender

19:31.289 --> 19:34.157
and if you attack the castle,

19:34.259 --> 19:37.293
honor compels me
to fight for Sansa's kin.

19:37.395 --> 19:39.462
Of course it does.

19:39.564 --> 19:41.064
To fight you.

19:45.570 --> 19:47.737
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

19:57.983 --> 20:00.016
<i>I've said no
three times already.</i>

20:00.118 --> 20:02.352
I have a signed letter
from your niece Sansa Stark.

20:02.454 --> 20:04.254
I haven't seen her
since she was a child.

20:04.356 --> 20:06.523
I don't know her signature.
I don't know you.

20:06.625 --> 20:10.093
And I will not surrender.
Double the guards tonight.

20:11.496 --> 20:13.730
The Kingslayer wants to try us.

20:13.832 --> 20:15.765
I can feel it.

20:16.868 --> 20:18.434
As I have said, my name is...

20:18.537 --> 20:20.970
Yes, Brienne of Tarth.
I know your father.

20:21.072 --> 20:22.872
- Good man.
- He always spoke highly of you.

20:22.974 --> 20:25.675
And if he were here now, I'd tell
him the same I'm telling you.

20:25.777 --> 20:28.211
If you think I'm abandoning
my family's seat

20:28.313 --> 20:30.613
on the Kingslayer's word of
honor, you're a bloody fool.

20:30.715 --> 20:33.383
Riverrun cannot stand against
the Lannisters and the Freys.

20:33.485 --> 20:37.086
We can stand longer than your
one-handed friend thinks we can.

20:37.189 --> 20:39.622
- He's not my friend.
- No?

20:41.393 --> 20:44.360
Who gave you permission to cross the
siege line and enter the castle?

20:44.462 --> 20:47.230
Who gave you that sword with
the gold lion on the pommel?

20:47.332 --> 20:51.134
Ser Jaime kept his word
to your niece Catelyn Stark.

20:51.236 --> 20:54.470
He sent me to find Sansa,
to help her as Catelyn wanted.

20:54.573 --> 20:56.673
He gave me this sword to protect her.

20:56.775 --> 20:59.442
That is what I have done
and I will continue to do

20:59.544 --> 21:01.845
until the day I die.

21:14.993 --> 21:17.327
She's exactly like her mother.

21:23.635 --> 21:26.669
I don't have enough men to
help her take Winterfell.

21:26.771 --> 21:28.838
You have more than she does.

21:28.940 --> 21:31.474
She wants her home back.
I understand that.

21:31.576 --> 21:33.443
But this is my home.

21:33.545 --> 21:35.511
And if Jaime Lannister wants it,

21:35.614 --> 21:39.215
he can bloody well take it
the way everyone else does.

21:55.967 --> 21:58.668
Find the maester.

21:58.770 --> 22:01.471
We need to get a raven
north to Sansa.

22:03.241 --> 22:04.974
What should I write?

22:07.779 --> 22:09.646
Tell her I failed.

22:40.478 --> 22:42.078
There's to be a royal announcement?

22:42.180 --> 22:44.147
There is.

22:44.249 --> 22:45.848
Why wasn't I informed?

22:47.819 --> 22:50.920
There is to be a royal announcement

22:51.022 --> 22:52.989
in the throne room

22:53.091 --> 22:55.091
at this very moment.

22:58.096 --> 23:00.129
Where are you going?

23:03.034 --> 23:05.101
To stand by my son.

23:05.203 --> 23:07.870
Your place is in the gallery

23:07.973 --> 23:10.640
with the other ladies of the court.

23:18.350 --> 23:19.983
<i>Your Grace...</i>

23:38.003 --> 23:40.336
<i>Lords and ladies,</i>

23:40.438 --> 23:43.072
the Faith and the Crown

23:43.174 --> 23:46.409
are the two pillars
that hold up this world.

23:46.511 --> 23:50.146
One collapses, so does the other.

23:51.716 --> 23:54.217
The Father judges us all.

23:54.319 --> 23:55.752
If you break his laws...

23:58.623 --> 24:00.890
<i>you will be punished.</i>

24:02.660 --> 24:06.462
After conferring with His
Holiness the High Septon,

24:06.564 --> 24:08.898
we have determined that Loras Tyrell

24:09.000 --> 24:10.700
and Cersei Lannister's trial

24:10.802 --> 24:12.869
<i>will be held in
the Great Sept of Baelor</i>

24:12.971 --> 24:15.471
<i>on the first day of the
Festival of the Mother.</i>

24:21.846 --> 24:24.847
Furthermore, after much prayer

24:24.949 --> 24:27.016
<i>and reflection,</i>

24:27.118 --> 24:30.219
the Crown has decided
that from this day forward,

24:30.321 --> 24:32.288
trial by combat will be forbidden

24:32.390 --> 24:34.424
throughout the Seven Kingdoms.

24:36.261 --> 24:38.461
<i>The tradition
is a brutish one,</i>

24:38.563 --> 24:40.530
<i>a scheme devised by corrupt rulers</i>

24:40.632 --> 24:43.266
<i>in order to avoid
true judgment from the gods.</i>

24:43.368 --> 24:45.868
<i>Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell</i>

24:45.970 --> 24:47.937
will stand trial before seven septons

24:48.039 --> 24:50.840
as it was in the earliest
days of the Faith.

24:50.942 --> 24:53.076
<i>Seven blessings to all.</i>

24:53.178 --> 24:55.044
<i>Seven blessings.</i>

25:17.435 --> 25:19.902
Your Grace...

25:20.004 --> 25:23.473
that old rumor you told me about.

25:25.110 --> 25:27.477
My little birds investigated.

25:29.347 --> 25:32.081
And?

25:32.183 --> 25:35.284
Was it just a rumor
or something more?

25:35.386 --> 25:37.019
More.

25:39.257 --> 25:40.857
Much more.

25:46.831 --> 25:49.031
<i>You seem happy.</i>

25:49.134 --> 25:50.967
I am happy.

25:52.203 --> 25:54.036
You should both be happy as well.

25:54.139 --> 25:58.508
Not so long ago, this city
was ready to devour itself.

25:58.610 --> 26:01.043
Now it's like a man reborn.

26:01.146 --> 26:03.246
I will be happy
when our queen returns.

26:03.348 --> 26:07.016
Why don't you drink? Why don't
either of you ever drink?

26:07.118 --> 26:08.451
Unsullied never drink.

26:08.553 --> 26:09.819
- Why not?
- Rules.

26:09.921 --> 26:12.221
And who made these rules?

26:12.323 --> 26:14.223
Your former masters?

26:14.325 --> 26:17.393
<i>Those miserable old shits
didn't want you to be human.</i>

26:17.495 --> 26:19.562
Have a drink with me.

26:22.534 --> 26:25.801
And you?
What's your excuse?

26:26.838 --> 26:28.337
I have tried wine before.

26:28.439 --> 26:30.239
It made me feel funny.

26:30.341 --> 26:32.308
That's how you know it's working.

26:34.779 --> 26:37.280
Here's to our queen.

26:37.382 --> 26:40.650
Anyone not drinking
is disrespecting our queen.

26:43.888 --> 26:46.088
To Daenerys Stormborn,
Mother of Dragons,

26:46.191 --> 26:48.891
Breaker of Chains,
long may she reign.

26:48.993 --> 26:51.194
- Long may she reign.
- Long may she reign.

26:56.935 --> 26:58.467
<i>Do you like it?</i>

26:58.570 --> 27:00.603
Tastes like it has turned.

27:00.705 --> 27:03.940
Yes, yes.
Fermentation.

27:07.512 --> 27:12.114
One day, after our queen has
taken the Seven Kingdoms...

27:13.851 --> 27:16.085
I'd like to have my own vineyard.

27:17.388 --> 27:20.022
Make my own wine.

27:20.124 --> 27:22.625
The Imp's Delight.

27:22.727 --> 27:25.194
Only my close friends could drink it.

27:28.800 --> 27:31.367
Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath.

27:31.469 --> 27:34.036
I do not know any jokes.

27:34.138 --> 27:35.271
Grey Worm?

27:37.842 --> 27:39.575
Right.

27:41.446 --> 27:44.447
Three lords walk into a tavern...

27:44.549 --> 27:47.049
a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister.

27:47.151 --> 27:48.651
<i>They order ale,</i>

27:48.753 --> 27:51.254
but when the barkeep
brings them over,

27:51.356 --> 27:53.856
each of them finds a fly in his cup.

27:53.958 --> 27:58.294
The Lannister, outraged, shoves the
cup aside and demands another.

27:58.396 --> 28:02.565
The Martell plucks the fly
out and swallows it whole.

28:03.601 --> 28:07.303
The Stark reaches into his cup,

28:07.405 --> 28:10.206
pulls out the fly and shouts,

28:10.308 --> 28:12.875
"Spit it out, you wee shit."

28:12.977 --> 28:14.310
"Spit it out."

28:20.118 --> 28:22.451
It's funnier in Westeros.

28:22.553 --> 28:25.755
The Starks and the Lannisters,
I thought these were enemies.

28:25.857 --> 28:26.889
Yes.

28:26.991 --> 28:30.626
A joke is like a story, Torgo Nudho.

28:30.728 --> 28:32.862
Not a true story, necessarily.

28:32.964 --> 28:35.965
A story that's supposed
to make you laugh ideally.

28:36.067 --> 28:37.867
<i>Not at the moment, perhaps.</i>

28:37.969 --> 28:40.369
<i>Missandei, do you like the wine?</i>

28:40.471 --> 28:41.904
I do.

28:42.006 --> 28:43.339
Tell a joke.

28:49.380 --> 28:52.214
Two translators are on a sinking ship.

28:53.951 --> 28:55.918
The first says,

28:56.020 --> 28:58.387
"Do you know how to swim?"

28:58.489 --> 29:02.958
The second says, "No, but I can
shout for help in 19 languages."

29:05.997 --> 29:08.564
Ah!

29:12.036 --> 29:14.136
That is the worst joke I ever heard.

29:14.238 --> 29:15.905
You don't even know what a joke is.

29:16.007 --> 29:18.908
I am soldier all my life.
You think I never hear joke?

29:19.010 --> 29:21.377
You lied to us.

29:22.947 --> 29:24.313
I make joke.

29:34.926 --> 29:36.292
More jokes.

29:36.394 --> 29:38.761
I once walked into a brothel

29:38.863 --> 29:40.496
with a honeycomb and a jackass.

29:40.598 --> 29:43.265
The madam says...

29:55.513 --> 29:58.180
The Masters have come
for their property.

30:16.267 --> 30:17.633
Lord Edmure.

30:19.504 --> 30:22.037
<i>I apologize for the way
the Freys treated you.</i>

30:22.140 --> 30:24.407
A man of your birth deserves better.

30:24.509 --> 30:28.477
You have my word you'll be properly
fed and clothed from now on.

30:30.481 --> 30:32.448
I have your word?

30:34.652 --> 30:37.052
Oh, good.

30:37.155 --> 30:39.188
Good, that's...

30:39.290 --> 30:41.257
that's a fine thing.

30:43.027 --> 30:45.995
My uncle will never
surrender the castle, ser.

30:46.097 --> 30:48.063
Whatever game you're playing.

30:48.166 --> 30:50.032
The Blackfish is an old man.

30:50.134 --> 30:52.234
A good death is all he can hope for.

30:52.336 --> 30:55.404
But you, you have a
child now, I've heard.

30:56.841 --> 30:59.341
A son you sired
on your wedding night.

30:59.444 --> 31:01.243
You're a potent man.

31:01.345 --> 31:03.679
A son I've never met

31:03.781 --> 31:06.515
born of a wife that I haven't seen

31:06.617 --> 31:07.950
since our first night together.

31:08.052 --> 31:09.585
You should be with them both.

31:10.788 --> 31:12.955
I can arrange that, you realize?

31:13.057 --> 31:15.090
Comfortable rooms for you
at Casterly Rock.

31:15.193 --> 31:18.394
A tutor for your boy, knights to
train him to fight and to ride.

31:18.496 --> 31:20.930
And when he comes of age,
he'll have a keep of his own.

31:21.032 --> 31:23.466
Do you imagine yourself
a decent person?

31:23.568 --> 31:26.101
Is that it?

31:26.204 --> 31:29.638
After you've massacred my family.

31:31.042 --> 31:32.842
Kept me in a cell for years.

31:32.944 --> 31:34.910
Stolen our lands.

31:35.012 --> 31:37.580
I'll remind you that
our houses are at war.

31:37.682 --> 31:39.815
I'm sorry if this conflict
has inconvenienced you,

31:39.917 --> 31:42.418
but rebelling against the
Crown does have consequences.

31:42.520 --> 31:44.965
Says the man who shoved his
sword through his king's back.

31:44.990 --> 31:47.623
Did I give you the impression
that this was a negotiation?

31:47.725 --> 31:48.958
It's not.

31:51.462 --> 31:54.363
You understand. On some
level you understand

31:54.465 --> 31:56.398
that you're an evil man.

31:56.501 --> 31:58.133
I'll leave the judgments to the gods.

31:58.236 --> 32:00.536
Well, that is convenient for you.

32:03.841 --> 32:07.443
You're a fine-looking
fellow, aren't you?

32:10.047 --> 32:12.615
Your square jaw,

32:12.717 --> 32:14.483
your golden armor.

32:16.153 --> 32:19.255
Tell me, I want to know.

32:19.357 --> 32:20.923
I truly do.

32:21.025 --> 32:22.491
How do you live with yourself?

32:26.230 --> 32:28.364
All of us have to believe

32:28.466 --> 32:31.467
that we're decent, don't we?

32:31.569 --> 32:34.737
You have to sleep at night.

32:34.839 --> 32:37.273
How do you tell yourself

32:37.375 --> 32:39.975
that you're decent

32:40.077 --> 32:42.578
after everything that you've done?

32:48.386 --> 32:50.753
I was your sister's prisoner once.

32:54.025 --> 32:57.493
She hit me on the head with a
rock if I remember correctly.

33:00.231 --> 33:02.064
Yeah.

33:03.768 --> 33:05.067
She should have killed you.

33:05.169 --> 33:07.036
Perhaps, but she didn't.

33:08.439 --> 33:12.174
Catelyn Stark hated me
just like you hate me.

33:12.276 --> 33:14.543
<i>But I didn't hate her.</i>

33:14.645 --> 33:16.211
I admired her.

33:16.314 --> 33:18.180
Far more than her husband or her son.

33:18.282 --> 33:20.549
Do you think I care whom you
admire and whom you don't?

33:20.651 --> 33:23.291
No, I don't, but I'm telling you
anyway because you're my prisoner.

33:23.321 --> 33:25.554
You don't have a choice.

33:25.656 --> 33:27.656
The love she had for her children,

33:27.758 --> 33:29.725
I was a little awed by it.

33:29.827 --> 33:32.194
Reminded me of my sister.

33:32.296 --> 33:35.431
Oh.
Oh, I see.

33:37.268 --> 33:39.068
You're a madman.

33:39.170 --> 33:41.036
I'm not here to trade insults.

33:41.138 --> 33:43.639
- Your sister was a strong...
- Don't talk about Cat!

33:43.741 --> 33:47.643
I'll talk about whomever I want.

33:48.679 --> 33:50.746
She loved her children.

33:50.848 --> 33:53.415
I suppose all mothers do,

33:53.517 --> 33:56.251
but Catelyn and Cersei,

33:56.354 --> 33:58.420
there's a fierceness
you don't often see.

33:58.522 --> 34:01.323
They'd do anything
to protect their babies.

34:01.425 --> 34:03.225
Start a war.

34:03.327 --> 34:07.096
Burn cities to ash.
Free their worst enemies.

34:07.198 --> 34:09.364
The things we do for love.

34:13.704 --> 34:17.473
You didn't come here
to talk about our sisters.

34:17.574 --> 34:20.476
That's exactly why I came here.

34:22.079 --> 34:24.246
I love Cersei.

34:24.348 --> 34:26.382
You can laugh at that if you want.

34:26.484 --> 34:28.550
You can sneer.
Doesn't matter.

34:28.652 --> 34:30.518
She needs me.

34:30.621 --> 34:34.456
And to get back to her,
I have to take Riverrun.

34:37.895 --> 34:41.030
I'll send for your baby boy.

34:41.132 --> 34:44.400
And I'll launch him into
Riverrun with a catapult.

34:44.502 --> 34:47.803
Because you don't matter
to me, Lord Edmure.

34:47.905 --> 34:50.472
Your son doesn't matter to me.

34:50.574 --> 34:54.243
The people in the castle
don't matter to me.

34:55.379 --> 34:57.479
Only Cersei.

34:59.016 --> 35:01.617
And if I have to
slaughter every Tully

35:01.719 --> 35:04.787
who ever lived to get back to her,

35:04.889 --> 35:07.389
that's what I'll do.

35:34.351 --> 35:36.919
<i>Who goes there?</i>

35:37.021 --> 35:38.754
Edmure Tully,

35:38.856 --> 35:40.322
son of Hoster Tully

35:40.424 --> 35:42.791
and the rightful Lord of Riverrun.

35:45.196 --> 35:47.062
I demand entry.

35:47.164 --> 35:49.965
Don't let him in.

35:50.067 --> 35:52.434
He's the Lord of Riverrun.

35:52.536 --> 35:53.769
I have to obey his commands.

35:53.871 --> 35:55.471
He's been their captive

35:55.573 --> 35:58.373
ever since they murdered
his king at the Red Wedding.

35:58.476 --> 36:01.510
Why do you think the people who
murdered his king at the Red Wedding

36:01.612 --> 36:04.880
would decide to let him come home?

36:04.982 --> 36:08.150
Because it's a trap, you idiot.

36:08.252 --> 36:09.551
Don't let him in.

36:09.653 --> 36:11.353
He's my lord, my lord.

36:11.455 --> 36:14.223
I've sworn to serve the Lord of
Riverrun and obey his commands.

36:14.325 --> 36:17.126
You're not obeying Edmure's commands.

36:17.228 --> 36:21.196
You're obeying the fucking
Kingslayer's commands.

36:21.298 --> 36:23.966
<i>I demand entry.</i>

36:24.068 --> 36:25.434
My lord has given an order.

36:25.536 --> 36:27.536
With a knife to his throat.

36:27.638 --> 36:30.072
That is not a valid order.

36:34.812 --> 36:36.912
Lower the drawbridge and
open the gate for Lord Ed...

36:37.014 --> 36:39.281
Aye, ser.

36:39.383 --> 36:42.918
I'll have your head before
I surrender Riverrun.

36:43.020 --> 36:46.688
You are not lord
of this castle, my lord.

36:58.402 --> 37:01.270
- Lower the drawbridge.
<i>- Aye, ser!</i>

37:45.716 --> 37:47.382
<i>If you're wrong,</i>

37:47.484 --> 37:51.153
we've just surrendered
our most valuable prisoner.

38:31.095 --> 38:32.928
Welcome home, my lord.

38:37.668 --> 38:40.903
Command all the forces within the
castle to lay down their arms.

38:43.040 --> 38:44.773
Open the gates.

38:44.875 --> 38:47.709
- My lord...
- Your lord has given a command.

39:21.712 --> 39:24.746
<i>Infantry, advance!</i>

39:37.895 --> 39:40.662
Find the Blackfish.

39:40.764 --> 39:43.999
Put him in irons and hand
him over to the Freys.

39:47.838 --> 39:49.671
Find him.

40:14.565 --> 40:16.665
Go on.

40:16.767 --> 40:18.000
Come with us.

40:18.102 --> 40:19.634
I've run before from the Red Wedding.

40:19.737 --> 40:22.037
I'm not running again.
This is my family home.

40:22.139 --> 40:25.774
Your family is in the North.
Come with us.

40:25.876 --> 40:28.910
Don't die for pride when you
can fight for your blood.

40:30.547 --> 40:34.182
You'll serve Sansa far
better than I ever could.

40:39.323 --> 40:40.856
<i>All the way down!</i>

40:40.958 --> 40:43.759
- <i>Check that out!</i>
- Go on, now.

40:43.861 --> 40:46.862
I haven't had a proper
sword fight in years.

40:46.964 --> 40:49.698
I expect I'll make
a damn fool of myself.

41:23.734 --> 41:26.468
We found the Blackfish, my lord.

41:26.570 --> 41:28.136
Good.

41:28.238 --> 41:30.539
Bring him to me.

41:30.641 --> 41:33.041
He died fighting, my lord.

43:03.267 --> 43:05.367
- I was wrong. I admit it.
- That changes nothing.

43:05.469 --> 43:07.869
The Unsullied could mount
a defense off the beachhead.

43:07.971 --> 43:09.025
If the slavers' forces...

43:09.145 --> 43:11.055
No more talking from you.
Your talking gave us this.

43:11.175 --> 43:12.815
And I have acknowledged that.
I'm trying...

43:12.843 --> 43:14.763
You're trying to tell me
what the army should do.

43:14.845 --> 43:17.279
<i>You do not know
what the army should do.</i>

43:17.381 --> 43:19.548
All right, what should the army do?

43:19.650 --> 43:21.416
We'll not go to the beach.

43:21.518 --> 43:23.818
If we go to the beach, the
Masters will take the pyramid.

43:23.921 --> 43:26.354
The pyramid is the only place
in the city we can defend.

43:26.456 --> 43:27.889
- We stay here.
- And then?

43:27.991 --> 43:29.791
We wait for them to come to us.

43:29.893 --> 43:32.093
Then we fight them.

44:42.266 --> 44:43.965
Clegane.

44:44.067 --> 44:46.167
What the fuck you doing here?

44:46.270 --> 44:48.370
Chasing them.
You?

44:48.472 --> 44:50.305
Hanging them.

44:50.407 --> 44:52.107
Any particular reason?

44:52.209 --> 44:54.576
They're our men.
Or they were.

44:54.678 --> 44:57.245
They attacked a nearby sept
and murdered the villagers.

44:57.347 --> 44:58.513
<i>Why do you want them?</i>

44:58.615 --> 45:00.115
Same reason.

45:00.217 --> 45:02.250
I was helping build it.

45:02.352 --> 45:04.586
<i>They killed a friend of mine.</i>

45:04.688 --> 45:05.954
You've got friends?

45:06.056 --> 45:08.923
Not anymore.
They're mine.

45:09.026 --> 45:11.626
It's the Brotherhood's good name
they've dragged through the dirt.

45:11.662 --> 45:13.361
Fuck your name.
They're mine.

45:13.463 --> 45:14.996
I killed you once before, Dondarrion.

45:15.098 --> 45:17.065
Happy to do it again.

45:17.167 --> 45:19.434
Drop that arrow, you bloody girl.

45:20.837 --> 45:23.271
Tougher girls than you
have tried to kill me.

45:25.542 --> 45:26.841
You can have one of them.

45:31.682 --> 45:33.048
Two.

45:44.795 --> 45:46.795
No, no, no.

45:46.897 --> 45:49.364
We're not butchers.
We hang them.

45:49.466 --> 45:51.099
Hanging?

45:51.201 --> 45:52.600
All over in an instant.

45:52.703 --> 45:54.135
Where's the punishment in that?

45:54.237 --> 45:56.838
- They die.
- We all bloody die.

45:56.940 --> 45:59.407
Except this one here.

45:59.509 --> 46:01.576
I'll only gut one of them.

46:01.678 --> 46:04.112
<i>No.</i>

46:04.214 --> 46:05.980
I'll chop off one hand.

46:06.083 --> 46:09.150
We gave you two of the three
out of respect for your loss.

46:09.252 --> 46:10.652
That's generous.

46:14.424 --> 46:17.492
Bunch of nancies.

46:17.594 --> 46:20.095
There was a time I would
have killed all seven of you

46:20.197 --> 46:21.363
just to gut these three.

46:21.465 --> 46:22.764
You're getting old, Clegane.

46:22.866 --> 46:24.332
He's not.

46:26.436 --> 46:28.970
Please don't.
I'll give you anything.

46:57.567 --> 46:59.434
Got anything to eat?

47:11.715 --> 47:13.882
Enjoying yourself?

47:13.984 --> 47:16.050
I prefer chicken.

47:17.487 --> 47:20.822
You ought to join us.
We could use you.

47:22.125 --> 47:24.592
I tried joining.
Didn't work out for me.

47:24.694 --> 47:27.629
Clegane, we're here for a reason.

47:29.199 --> 47:32.567
The Lord of Light is keeping
Beric alive for a reason.

47:32.669 --> 47:35.036
He gave a failed, drunk priest

47:35.138 --> 47:37.872
the power to bring him
back for a reason.

47:37.974 --> 47:40.308
We are part of something
larger than ourselves.

47:40.410 --> 47:43.578
Lots of horrible shit
in this world gets done

47:43.680 --> 47:45.747
for something larger than ourselves.

47:53.056 --> 47:56.057
Cold winds are rising in the North.

47:56.159 --> 47:58.460
And you're going to go stop them?

47:59.596 --> 48:01.129
We need good men to help us.

48:01.231 --> 48:04.999
Last time you saw me,
you wanted to execute me.

48:06.636 --> 48:08.236
<i>True enough.</i>

48:08.338 --> 48:11.406
But the Lord of Light gave
you the power to defeat me.

48:11.508 --> 48:14.008
Why?

48:14.110 --> 48:17.011
I beat you because I'm
better than you, Beric.

48:17.113 --> 48:21.349
I was better than you before you
started yammering on about the Lord

48:21.451 --> 48:24.419
and I'm better than you now.

48:24.521 --> 48:26.321
Aye, you're probably right.

48:26.423 --> 48:29.257
You're a fighter.

48:29.359 --> 48:31.593
You were born a fighter.

48:31.695 --> 48:34.095
You walked away from the fight.

48:34.197 --> 48:35.864
How did that go?

48:38.668 --> 48:41.936
Good and bad, young and old,

48:42.038 --> 48:44.806
the things we're fighting
will destroy them all alike.

48:46.643 --> 48:49.878
<i>You can still help a lot more
than you've harmed, Clegane.</i>

48:49.980 --> 48:51.880
It's not too late for you.

49:55.679 --> 49:57.478
Lady Crane?

50:05.722 --> 50:07.589
<i>Lady Crane?</i>

50:13.863 --> 50:17.632
If you'd have done your job, she
would have died painlessly.

50:19.869 --> 50:21.970
Instead...

50:24.040 --> 50:26.507
The Many-Faced God
was promised a name.

50:27.911 --> 50:30.011
He must always receive what is his.

50:30.113 --> 50:32.814
You can't change that.

50:32.916 --> 50:35.350
I can't change that.

50:35.452 --> 50:37.485
No one can.

50:40.123 --> 50:42.590
And now he's been
promised another name.

50:58.141 --> 51:00.341
- Hey!
- Get out!

51:03.213 --> 51:05.146
Yah!

52:24.661 --> 52:26.394
Hey!

52:29.199 --> 52:31.032
Yah!

52:32.102 --> 52:33.634
Ah!

52:45.749 --> 52:48.082
My basket!

54:22.111 --> 54:23.678
It will all be over soon.

54:25.114 --> 54:27.915
On your knees or on your feet?

54:38.661 --> 54:40.895
Haven't we been through this already?

54:43.066 --> 54:44.832
That won't help you.

55:56.539 --> 55:58.572
You told her to kill me.

56:05.281 --> 56:06.914
Yes.

56:07.016 --> 56:09.483
<i>But here you are.</i>

56:09.585 --> 56:12.286
And there she is.

56:22.498 --> 56:25.366
Finally a girl is no one.

56:28.771 --> 56:32.273
A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell

56:32.375 --> 56:34.508
and I'm going home.
