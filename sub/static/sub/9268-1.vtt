00:14.520 --> 00:17.440
How many more times?
Two more should square it.

00:17.441 --> 00:19.080
One.

00:22.400 --> 00:24.358
Do you know what they did
in the Old Testament

00:24.359 --> 00:26.920
to people who reneged
on their debts?

00:28.480 --> 00:31.400
Stoned them to death.
Caved their heads in.

00:31.401 --> 00:33.200
That's not true.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.999
Take a look. I don't need to.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.719
Unlike you, I've read it.

00:38.720 --> 00:41.479
I bet. Cover to cover.

00:41.480 --> 00:42.880
Good little Catholic girl.

00:47.280 --> 00:49.440
You're just being a good wife,
remember?

00:51.720 --> 00:53.360
Let me hear you say it.

00:55.760 --> 00:57.000
I'm a good wife.

00:58.680 --> 01:00.360
If you ever doubt that...

01:02.680 --> 01:07.279
then remember,
if I don't get what I'm owed,

01:07.280 --> 01:11.720
I'll turn you from a wife
to a widow in the blink of an eye.

01:15.160 --> 01:16.440
I swear it.

01:20.120 --> 01:21.680
So help me, God.

01:57.640 --> 01:59.040
Good morning!

02:26.920 --> 02:28.479
Two utensils per dish.

02:28.480 --> 02:31.200
Plates at the beginning, napkins
at the end. Savoury to sweet.

02:31.201 --> 02:32.600
Yes, Reverend.

02:40.240 --> 02:42.960
Father Brown!
So glad you could come.

02:44.480 --> 02:45.558
How could I not?

02:45.559 --> 02:47.798
Rumour has it
you've invited half my flock.

02:47.799 --> 02:49.878
Couldn't resist
sharing my good fortune.

02:49.879 --> 02:52.558
Just so long as you're not planning
on poaching any of my souls.

02:52.559 --> 02:55.200
Wouldn't dream of it!
You're a wicked man, Reverend.

02:58.320 --> 02:59.639
Just one moment.

02:59.640 --> 03:04.159
Ah! Not there.
The petals will fall in the salad.

03:04.160 --> 03:07.239
Looks nice. Like garnish.

03:07.240 --> 03:11.239
Susie? Mrs McCarthy?
It's like I never left St Mary's!

03:11.240 --> 03:12.439
Agreed.

03:12.440 --> 03:14.358
The Reverend Bohun asked me to bake

03:14.359 --> 03:18.880
some of my award-winning strawberry
scones. So, how could I refuse?

03:18.881 --> 03:20.999
And how can I?

03:21.000 --> 03:23.559
Not yet! When the guests arrive.

03:23.560 --> 03:25.479
Thought I was a guest.

03:25.480 --> 03:29.799
Kluski z makiem I rodzynkami.
It's very popular in Poland.

03:29.800 --> 03:31.960
With whom? Household pets?

03:34.560 --> 03:36.000
Mmm!

03:38.920 --> 03:41.839
I don't think so, Reverend.

03:41.840 --> 03:44.679
Simeon's very busy today.

03:44.680 --> 03:46.839
Too busy for scones and tea?

03:46.840 --> 03:49.200
Well, I've just
started preparing lunch.

03:49.201 --> 03:51.879
Come afterwards. Please!

03:51.880 --> 03:53.520
It won't be the same without you.

03:54.640 --> 03:56.079
Yes, all right.

03:56.080 --> 03:57.280
Wonderful.

04:09.600 --> 04:12.519
So, what do you think? Hmm?

04:12.520 --> 04:13.880
The new clock tower.

04:13.881 --> 04:17.559
New roofing slates, cast iron dials,
brand new bell.

04:17.560 --> 04:21.320
Kembleford will hear its first
resounding bellow at 3pm precisely.

04:21.321 --> 04:22.799
Are you sure?

04:22.800 --> 04:24.439
What do you mean?

04:24.440 --> 04:28.480
Well, it seems to be running
about ten seconds too slow.

04:29.920 --> 04:32.320
You can't tell that
from a pocket watch.

04:32.321 --> 04:34.079
You're pulling my leg.

04:34.080 --> 04:35.560
Wouldn't dream of it!

04:47.000 --> 04:48.279
Fry-up for lunch?

04:48.280 --> 04:52.560
Well, I thought you deserved it,
you've been working so hard.

04:54.280 --> 04:55.918
Oh, and don't get too excited,

04:55.919 --> 04:59.438
but I did tell the Reverend we'd
make it to his extravaganza later.

04:59.439 --> 05:01.520
Oh, I've got three more jobs on.

05:01.521 --> 05:04.479
I know, but we could afford
a short break.

05:04.480 --> 05:08.080
We can't afford anything,
least alone a fry-up, can we?

05:09.760 --> 05:11.879
Look. Look...

05:11.880 --> 05:13.479
I'm sorry.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.760
I'm sorry. It smells delicious.

05:18.200 --> 05:20.399
What?

05:20.400 --> 05:21.559
What?

05:21.560 --> 05:22.960
I'm just...

05:24.240 --> 05:26.040
just thinking how lucky I am.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.799
What did I say?

05:32.800 --> 05:34.080
Nothing.

05:35.240 --> 05:37.120
I'm just tired, that's all.

05:39.520 --> 05:42.240
You're not going to wear this
to the table, are you? It's filthy.

05:51.280 --> 05:53.159
Better?

05:53.160 --> 05:54.920
Coo-eee!

05:57.320 --> 05:59.719
I am SO sorry to disturb you!

05:59.720 --> 06:02.320
I was wondering
if we could borrow some...

06:02.321 --> 06:04.079
Oh!

06:04.080 --> 06:06.119
I'll put something on.

06:06.120 --> 06:07.600
Yes, thank you.

06:09.040 --> 06:10.839
We've run out of plates.

06:10.840 --> 06:15.000
I think we'll need 10 or 15
at least, if you can spare.

06:18.480 --> 06:21.438
I have made my award-winning
strawberry scones

06:21.439 --> 06:24.040
and I expect them
to be popular as ever.

06:36.240 --> 06:39.680
'Thank you, dear. You're welcome.
Very much appreciated.'

06:58.120 --> 07:00.158
I shudder to think
what I might've seen

07:00.159 --> 07:01.678
if I'd arrived a few minutes later.

07:01.679 --> 07:05.680
You must acknowledge that evolution
renders God superfluous, at best.

07:06.880 --> 07:10.560
No, on the contrary. The majesty of
life's tapestry reveals the divine.

07:10.561 --> 07:12.079
It doesn't deny it.

07:12.080 --> 07:14.158
You ought to spend some time
with me in the field,

07:14.159 --> 07:16.078
watching insects
devouring each other.

07:16.079 --> 07:17.880
Then tell me how divine
you think it is.

07:17.881 --> 07:21.039
That sounds fascinating.
I love camping.

07:21.040 --> 07:22.839
Tell me when and where.

07:22.840 --> 07:24.519
Father Brown!

07:24.520 --> 07:26.080
Talking of wildlife...

07:27.400 --> 07:31.720
Lady Felicia, you appear to have
something nesting in your hat.

07:31.721 --> 07:34.079
Oh! You do tickle me, Father.

07:34.080 --> 07:36.120
I hear you're entertaining us later.

07:36.121 --> 07:39.759
Reverend Bohun has insisted
I perform my Habanera.

07:39.760 --> 07:40.879
I'm sure he did.

07:40.880 --> 07:44.240
Polish delicacy?
Award-winning scone? Oh, how lovely.

08:02.720 --> 08:05.720
Seems my invitation
got lost in the post.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.039
Ecumenical harmony.

08:24.040 --> 08:25.640
Warms the heart.

08:26.720 --> 08:29.720
Catholics and Anglicans
taking tea together,

08:29.721 --> 08:31.999
pretending to be all chummy.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.759
Pretending?

08:33.760 --> 08:35.279
Oh, come on, Father.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.960
Underneath it all you think
the other side's going to hell.

08:37.961 --> 08:43.078
And besides, all the pomp
and bluster of Catholicism,

08:43.080 --> 08:45.679
it's all a bit silly, isn't it?

08:45.680 --> 08:46.920
Norman!

08:48.520 --> 08:49.999
Forgive my brother.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.038
He's entitled to his opinion.
As odious as it is.

08:53.039 --> 08:55.078
I, for one,
find Norman's candour refreshing.

08:55.079 --> 08:56.920
As refreshing as a used toilet!

08:58.000 --> 09:01.519
Oh, I do beg your pardon.
That was most uncouth.

09:01.520 --> 09:04.400
Erm, award-winning scone?

09:11.840 --> 09:14.399
You're a vulgar man.

09:14.400 --> 09:16.319
Lady Felicia,

09:16.320 --> 09:20.479
I may be wrong but, judging
by your general demeanour

09:20.480 --> 09:24.520
and the way you're looking at me,
I'd say I'm making you randy.

09:47.680 --> 09:50.160
Elizabeth, haven't seen
you at mass for a while.

09:50.161 --> 09:51.439
Is anything wrong?

09:51.440 --> 09:54.040
I'm sorry, Father. Just busy.

09:55.520 --> 09:57.160
I'm not chastising you.

09:58.400 --> 10:00.440
Is there anything you want
to talk about? No...

10:00.441 --> 10:02.520
Everything's fine. Thank you.

10:13.240 --> 10:14.840
You're supposed to be gone!

10:14.841 --> 10:16.279
I need more money.

10:16.280 --> 10:18.518
I gave you £10.
You're not getting a penny more.

10:18.519 --> 10:20.158
You know how expensive is London?

10:20.159 --> 10:22.760
It'll cost you more
if you stay here. I guarantee it.

You forgot something, you vile,
disgusting rodent!

11:07.439 --> 11:09.000
You're finished, Barnes.

11:34.840 --> 11:37.240
So this is where you hide
the good stuff, is it?

11:45.400 --> 11:47.440
I'm cutting you off.

11:48.720 --> 11:51.998
Excuse me? Father left a clause
in the inheritance.

11:51.999 --> 11:55.240
It entrusts me with
the purse strings, including
all real estate holdings.

11:55.241 --> 11:56.800
I'm invoking it.

11:57.960 --> 12:00.158
Do you think I wanted it
to come to this?

12:00.159 --> 12:01.478
You're out of control.

12:01.479 --> 12:04.518
Drinking, gambling,
indulging your basest appetites.

12:04.519 --> 12:07.520
This is a lie.
It's all there in black and white.

12:09.880 --> 12:11.639
As is this.

12:11.640 --> 12:14.520
It's not too late
for you to be saved, Norman.

12:15.960 --> 12:17.440
Please.

12:18.480 --> 12:19.880
Let us pray.

12:38.160 --> 12:39.680
Is it true?

13:20.240 --> 13:21.840
Oh!

13:31.200 --> 13:32.640
All right?

13:37.360 --> 13:39.000
Trust you to liven up a party.

13:42.920 --> 13:45.038
Poker game still on
for next weekend?

13:45.039 --> 13:48.920
No of fence, but right now I don't
need the fawnings of a sycophant.

13:59.520 --> 14:03.120
Where's the Reverend? He's going to
miss his big moment. Ah!

14:03.121 --> 14:04.840
Oh!

14:06.240 --> 14:08.039
Everything all right?

14:08.040 --> 14:11.600
I'll be fine. Can't let my brother's
shenanigans ruin the day.

14:11.601 --> 14:14.199
No. Thank you for coming.

14:14.200 --> 14:17.759
My sincerest apologies
for the fracas earlier.

14:17.760 --> 14:19.799
We won't let it spoil things.

14:19.800 --> 14:23.198
We've been blessed with
beautiful weather, and in about

14:23.199 --> 14:27.080
ten seconds we'll be blessed
with the sound of glorious bells.

14:28.560 --> 14:32.879
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

14:32.880 --> 14:38.000
five, four, three, two, one.

15:04.960 --> 15:07.479
Norman! No!

15:07.480 --> 15:09.240
Oh, sweet Jesus!

15:12.240 --> 15:13.920
He's dead.

15:22.840 --> 15:25.439
Looks like a single blow
to the head.

15:25.440 --> 15:27.878
The skull's been
crushed like an eggshell.

15:27.879 --> 15:30.840
Fragments of bone driven
through the ground and body.

15:32.440 --> 15:35.039
Perhaps you should go inside.

15:35.040 --> 15:36.318
I'm not going anywhere.

15:36.319 --> 15:37.480
Search for a weapon.

15:39.920 --> 15:43.360
Lady Felicia, did you see anyone
running away from the scene?

15:43.361 --> 15:45.439
I can't, um...

15:45.440 --> 15:46.880
I just...

15:49.240 --> 15:50.960
It's all right. Take your time.

15:52.120 --> 15:53.480
I was cleaning my hat.

15:55.920 --> 16:00.520
I looked out and I saw
he was lying there.

16:02.080 --> 16:05.839
I... I didn't see anyone else.

16:05.840 --> 16:08.679
I'm sorry,
I think I need to lie down.

16:08.680 --> 16:10.440
Come on. Yes.

16:12.960 --> 16:15.278
I'm going to need statements
from all of you.

16:15.279 --> 16:16.800
Who last saw Mr Bohun alive?

16:22.480 --> 16:25.759
Isn't that obvious? The murderer.

16:25.760 --> 16:28.078
He attacked him
less than an hour before

16:28.079 --> 16:30.000
in front of dozens of witnesses.

16:30.001 --> 16:31.639
Mr Barnes?

16:31.640 --> 16:34.599
Mr Barnes, did you do this?

16:34.600 --> 16:36.520
He got what was coming to him.

16:36.521 --> 16:38.519
Is that a confession?

16:38.520 --> 16:41.839
You don't need a confession.
Look at his head.

16:41.840 --> 16:43.840
Who else could deliver such a blow?

16:44.920 --> 16:46.560
Inspector.

17:01.240 --> 17:02.720
Is this one of yours?

17:04.119 --> 17:06.040
Yeah.

17:08.960 --> 17:10.877
Simeon Barnes, I'm arresting you

17:10.878 --> 17:13.358
on suspicion of the murder
of Norman Bohun.

17:13.358 --> 17:15.920
You are not obliged
to say anything... Wait!

17:19.960 --> 17:21.560
It was me.

17:24.839 --> 17:26.319
I did it.

17:26.319 --> 17:28.799
No. I'm sorry, Reverend.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.399
That's not possible.

17:30.400 --> 17:33.318
Look at her. She has neither
the strength nor the brutality.

17:33.319 --> 17:35.718
Mrs Barnes, if you're trying
to protect your husband...

17:35.719 --> 17:37.400
I stole the hammer from the forge.

17:38.680 --> 17:40.240
I crept up behind him.

17:41.880 --> 17:45.280
And... And I hit him.
I swear it, its true.

17:47.480 --> 17:48.959
So help me God.

17:48.960 --> 17:50.600
Elizabeth.

17:52.160 --> 17:54.479
Elizabeth Barnes,

17:54.480 --> 17:56.758
I'm arresting you
for the murder of Norman Bohun.

17:56.759 --> 17:59.518
You are not obliged to say anything
unless you wish to do so,

17:59.519 --> 18:01.758
but whatever you say
will be taken down in writing

18:01.759 --> 18:03.600
and may be given in evidence.

18:26.880 --> 18:29.639
I tried so hard to save him.

18:29.640 --> 18:30.880
I know.

18:35.440 --> 18:37.400
I can't believe Elizabeth
could do this.

18:38.720 --> 18:40.479
It had to be Simeon.

18:40.480 --> 18:43.920
I'm fond of her, too, but we mustn't
allow our emotions to blind us

18:43.921 --> 18:47.039
to the possibility
that she may be guilty.

18:47.040 --> 18:48.839
Not of murder.

18:48.840 --> 18:51.719
Not her. It's not in her nature.

18:51.720 --> 18:52.918
Even if you're right,

18:52.919 --> 18:55.638
it doesn't necessarily follow
that Simeon is the culprit.

18:55.639 --> 18:57.198
Trust you to look for mysteries

18:57.199 --> 19:00.038
when the truth's
right in front of your eyes.

19:00.039 --> 19:03.958
I don't so much look for mysteries,
as they come looking for me.

19:03.959 --> 19:07.558
And your penchant for spy novels
and crossword puzzles?

19:07.559 --> 19:09.280
That's forced upon you, is it?

19:10.800 --> 19:12.280
You may be right.

19:14.080 --> 19:18.038
But you must admit that your brother
had a certain reputation.

19:18.039 --> 19:20.118
And Simeon Barnes
is not the only person

19:20.119 --> 19:21.720
who'll be glad that he's gone.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.478
Then you admit Elizabeth
may be innocent?

19:25.479 --> 19:27.040
I never said otherwise.

19:27.041 --> 19:29.279
Then speak to the inspector.

19:29.280 --> 19:31.240
You know him better than I do.
Tell him.

19:34.560 --> 19:37.160
I don't think he'll appreciate me
interfering.

19:38.640 --> 19:40.400
When has that stopped you before?

20:04.840 --> 20:07.360
She says Norman threatened
to kill her husband,

20:07.361 --> 20:09.279
so she got to him first.

20:09.280 --> 20:11.240
Can't get much more
out of her than that.

20:12.480 --> 20:14.400
But she's put her name to it now.

20:14.401 --> 20:17.239
Doesn't mean much if she's lying.

20:17.240 --> 20:19.720
It does to
the prosecuting solicitors.

20:37.800 --> 20:40.759
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

20:40.760 --> 20:43.200
It's been one month
since my last confession.

20:48.240 --> 20:50.440
I've had relations
outside of marriage.

20:51.720 --> 20:53.080
Twice.

20:55.080 --> 20:57.959
I thought you and Simeon were happy.

20:57.960 --> 20:59.320
We were.

21:00.400 --> 21:02.599
Simeon...

21:02.600 --> 21:04.440
He gambles.

21:05.680 --> 21:08.280
I found an IOU note for £50.

21:09.840 --> 21:13.239
Poker. We'd lose everything.

21:13.240 --> 21:14.480
The house...

21:16.680 --> 21:18.358
I tried to talk to him about it,

21:18.359 --> 21:21.040
but he told me not to worry,
that he'd sort it out.

21:22.440 --> 21:23.880
Typical man.

21:25.720 --> 21:28.920
So I went to Norman
and I begged him to waive the debt.

21:30.680 --> 21:32.360
And he agreed...

21:33.880 --> 21:35.400
on the condition that I...

21:38.840 --> 21:40.360
I'm so sorry, Elizabeth.

21:45.160 --> 21:47.680
Is there anything else
you wish to confess?

21:50.960 --> 21:52.360
No.

21:53.640 --> 21:56.359
Then you must tell the inspector.

21:56.360 --> 21:58.479
I won't see my husband hang.

21:58.480 --> 22:01.118
Norman Bohun had
any number of enemies.

22:01.119 --> 22:04.958
Well, until one of them
turns up with blood on their hands,

22:04.959 --> 22:06.640
I won't say anything else.

22:19.680 --> 22:21.159
Anything?

22:21.160 --> 22:22.880
You know I wish I could tell you.

22:24.400 --> 22:26.519
How about this?

22:26.520 --> 22:29.320
Tap your brolly on the floor,
once for yes, twice for no.

22:30.480 --> 22:32.318
You know it's not that simple.

22:32.319 --> 22:33.600
It's a woman's life.

22:33.601 --> 22:36.200
And her soul, lest we forget.

22:38.800 --> 22:40.279
Inspector...

22:40.280 --> 22:43.160
Were her fingerprints
found on the hammer?

22:43.161 --> 22:44.759
Oh, no you don't.

22:44.760 --> 22:46.240
I'm only trying to help.

22:46.241 --> 22:48.119
Then quid pro quo.

22:48.120 --> 22:50.599
You see? I know a bit of Latin, too.

22:50.600 --> 22:52.719
You know I can't.

22:52.720 --> 22:54.318
I thought you were a renegade.

22:54.319 --> 22:56.238
Hardly.
Though I'm flattered you think so.

22:56.239 --> 22:58.360
Then do the heroic thing
and tell me what you know.

23:00.160 --> 23:03.318
Then, unless you have information
pertinent to this investigation,

23:03.319 --> 23:06.400
information you can actually
share, don't get involved.

23:49.160 --> 23:52.520
Father, which floors do you want me
do first? Presbytery or church?

23:53.720 --> 23:55.159
Yes, why not?

23:55.160 --> 23:57.879
Good morning, Father. Susie.

23:57.880 --> 24:01.038
I thought I'd make a start
on the quarterly accounts.

24:01.039 --> 24:03.640
Don't bother,
he's been on moon last few days.

24:05.520 --> 24:06.879
Father Brown?

24:06.880 --> 24:10.240
Are you all right?
You had that look on your face.

24:11.520 --> 24:12.919
Look?

24:12.920 --> 24:14.639
Wheels turning.

24:14.640 --> 24:17.678
You don't usually get that look
unless there's something amiss.

24:17.679 --> 24:19.960
There's nothing amiss. Don't worry.

24:21.200 --> 24:23.040
So, you're going to the funeral?

24:23.041 --> 24:24.279
Mm.

24:24.280 --> 24:27.320
Do you really think Mrs Barnes
is responsible for...?

24:27.321 --> 24:28.920
Why do you say that?

24:32.640 --> 24:34.439
You think that Susie...?

24:34.440 --> 24:36.519
If you must get it out of me,

24:36.520 --> 24:40.118
I saw Susie and Norman arguing
shortly before he was found murdered.

24:40.119 --> 24:43.360
And when the inspector asked
if anyone saw Norman

24:43.361 --> 24:46.440
before it happened,
she didn't say anything.

24:47.560 --> 24:49.560
What were they arguing about?
I...

24:54.280 --> 24:57.280
I don't know.
I think it was about money.

25:00.880 --> 25:05.919
Even so, Susie's hardly the type
to commit cold-blooded murder.

25:05.920 --> 25:08.480
You only say that
because you're so fond of her.

25:09.720 --> 25:12.840
Do you think I should tell
Inspector Valentine?

25:12.841 --> 25:14.439
Not yet.

25:14.440 --> 25:16.000
I'll speak to Susie myself...

25:16.001 --> 25:17.600
'after the funeral.'

25:29.200 --> 25:31.160
You all right, Wilfred?

25:34.000 --> 25:37.519
I have some snacks.
I'll put them out.

25:37.520 --> 25:39.640
Don't trouble yourself,
I'm not staying.

25:43.120 --> 25:44.360
Fine.

25:47.800 --> 25:49.520
Did you speak to Elizabeth?

25:49.521 --> 25:51.479
Yes. And?

25:51.480 --> 25:54.200
Let's just say I'm investigating.

26:01.120 --> 26:04.718
Always sad when so few people come
to pay their respects.

26:04.719 --> 26:06.678
Even for someone like Norman?

26:06.679 --> 26:10.640
Presumably, you don't think
he was a bad sort? Being his friend.

26:10.641 --> 26:13.439
Maybe I'm a bad sort, Father.

26:13.440 --> 26:15.240
Think about that.

26:17.240 --> 26:19.559
You don't strike me as one.

26:19.560 --> 26:22.520
Well, appearances and all that.

26:37.880 --> 26:40.120
Why won't you admit it?

26:41.720 --> 26:44.358
Your wife is in prison for a crime
she didn't commit.

26:44.359 --> 26:46.158
Don't talk to me about my wife.

26:46.159 --> 26:48.198
Do you not fear eternity in hell?

26:48.199 --> 26:50.718
What, like your brother, you mean?
The adulterer?

26:50.719 --> 26:52.518
Cos that's where he is now,
isn't he?

26:52.519 --> 26:54.718
Fire stripping the flesh
from his bones.

26:54.719 --> 26:56.800
An eternity of blistering agony

26:56.801 --> 26:58.000
Stop it!

26:59.960 --> 27:01.918
What, two-pronged attack, is it?

27:01.919 --> 27:03.838
Shall we go inside, Reverend?

27:03.839 --> 27:05.558
Do you not care about your wife?

27:05.559 --> 27:07.760
I said don't talk to me
about my wife!

27:07.761 --> 27:09.799
Mr Barnes!

27:09.800 --> 27:11.040
You see?

27:28.600 --> 27:29.840
Oh.

27:31.600 --> 27:34.679
Oh, I run out of disinfector.

27:34.680 --> 27:36.400
Disinfectant.

27:37.480 --> 27:38.800
I'll go shops.

27:39.800 --> 27:41.120
Yes, dear.

28:25.560 --> 28:26.800
Good morning.

28:51.520 --> 28:52.760
Good morning.

29:59.680 --> 30:01.440
We all have our vices.

30:02.440 --> 30:04.040
I come in peace.

30:08.280 --> 30:09.760
Are you following me?

30:11.960 --> 30:13.639
Guilty as charged.

30:13.640 --> 30:16.438
Last thing anyone wants
in here is a preacher.

30:16.439 --> 30:17.678
I haven't come to preach.

30:17.679 --> 30:19.958
How about you make
yourself useful?

30:19.959 --> 30:23.560
Use your divine insight, tell me
which one of these has His blessing.

30:23.561 --> 30:26.199
No, I couldn't possibly. Oh.

30:26.200 --> 30:30.200
But if I were a betting man,
I'd go for...

30:34.440 --> 30:36.320
Fluffy Duck. Right.

30:37.480 --> 30:39.000
Ten bob on Fluffy Duck.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.278
And I always had
you down as a non-believer.

30:44.279 --> 30:45.800
Well, your guess is as good as any.

30:45.801 --> 30:48.839
Yet that amounts to
an awful lot of faith.

30:48.840 --> 30:51.960
Why don't you give this one a miss?
Get out of my way.

30:51.961 --> 30:53.560
Or?

30:56.200 --> 30:57.680
I spoke to Elizabeth.

31:00.640 --> 31:02.600
I think you should, too.

31:04.240 --> 31:05.599
Why's that?

31:05.600 --> 31:07.199
Because you love her.

31:07.200 --> 31:08.879
After what she did?

31:08.880 --> 31:12.039
Yes. Even after what she did.

31:12.040 --> 31:13.800
That's what love is, isn't it?

31:15.320 --> 31:17.240
Did she say anything about...

31:19.080 --> 31:20.319
why she did it?

31:20.320 --> 31:24.239
What? The infidelity?
Or the...? Both.

31:24.240 --> 31:25.640
Both.

31:27.760 --> 31:29.440
You didn't kill him.

31:30.640 --> 31:32.080
No.

31:34.480 --> 31:36.120
You think she's innocent?

31:38.440 --> 31:41.920
I think you should
to talk to your wife.

31:44.240 --> 31:47.120
Come on, come on!
Come on, Fluffy Duck! Faster!

31:49.520 --> 31:50.920
Faster!

31:52.320 --> 31:53.959
Get in. Come on, Fluffy!

31:53.960 --> 31:56.360
Yes, Fluffy Duck, come on!

31:58.560 --> 32:00.680
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

32:00.681 --> 32:03.240
'Eternal Passion takes it.'
Aw!

32:07.680 --> 32:11.000
Father Brown, I've been
looking for you everywhere.

32:11.001 --> 32:13.159
You look in bloom.

32:13.160 --> 32:14.999
I followed Susie.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.079
Into a florist's?

32:17.080 --> 32:19.039
She lied to me.

32:19.040 --> 32:20.880
About what?

32:30.320 --> 32:32.638
'The next train to
arrive at platform one

32:32.639 --> 32:35.760
'is the delayed
half-past-one train to Worcester

32:35.761 --> 32:41.319
'calling at Waterloo Marsh, Evesham,
Pershore, Worcester Shrub Hill

32:41.320 --> 32:43.280
'and Worcester Foregate Street.'

32:55.400 --> 32:57.638
Afternoon, Inspector.
Lovely day for it.

32:57.639 --> 32:59.478
I hear you've been doing
some sleuthing.

32:59.479 --> 33:00.918
Just taking care of my flock.

33:00.919 --> 33:02.918
I specifically told you
not to get involved.

33:02.919 --> 33:05.638
I'm sorry, Inspector, I can't hear
you over this awful wind.

33:05.639 --> 33:07.679
Then slow down. In fact, stop.

33:07.680 --> 33:09.640
Father Brown!

33:32.000 --> 33:33.760
Are you OK?

33:59.200 --> 34:01.160
Ticket, Father? Church business!

34:02.400 --> 34:04.280
Susie!

34:11.719 --> 34:13.998
I used to clean his house.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.320
Norman Bohun?

34:16.840 --> 34:19.998
He gave me big tips.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.840
Tried to make some doings with me,
but I didn't let him.

34:23.841 --> 34:25.679
Father?

34:25.679 --> 34:28.120
Sister Mary, Sister Margaret.

34:29.679 --> 34:33.639
Is that what Mrs McCarthy heard
you arguing about at the party?

34:33.641 --> 34:35.040
No.

34:37.960 --> 34:41.879
The people in camp,
they are really poor.

34:41.880 --> 34:44.120
Some not as lucky as me to get work.

34:45.880 --> 34:48.119
They need money. I help them.

34:48.120 --> 34:49.159
How?

34:51.480 --> 34:52.920
I found out secret.

34:54.400 --> 34:56.520
Told him he has to pay or I tell.

34:58.520 --> 35:00.600
You were blackmailing him?

35:02.440 --> 35:03.839
I tried.

35:03.840 --> 35:07.999
But he said, "No.
Who would believe an immigrant?"

35:08.000 --> 35:11.640
Orders me to leave the village.
Says if I don't he'll hurt me.

35:13.280 --> 35:14.520
But someone hurt him.

35:16.240 --> 35:17.640
It wasn't me.

35:19.680 --> 35:21.080
What was the secret?

35:25.200 --> 35:29.559
Last month,
I arrived early to his house.

35:29.560 --> 35:32.680
He didn't hear me.
I went to his bedroom...

35:35.960 --> 35:38.239
I can't say it. Not to you.

35:38.240 --> 35:43.200
Trust me, Susie, there's not much
I haven't heard in my line of work.

35:48.560 --> 35:50.440
He was with a man.

35:58.840 --> 36:00.758
I spoke to the prosecuting solicitor.

36:00.759 --> 36:02.798
He won't accept your retraction.

36:02.799 --> 36:05.520
I'm afraid I have to formally charge
you with murder. I'm sorry.

36:05.521 --> 36:06.999
But she didn't do it.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.600
As far as the pro sols are concerned,
she had means,

36:09.601 --> 36:11.279
motive, and opportunity.

36:11.280 --> 36:13.798
As did I
and a score of other people.

36:13.799 --> 36:15.918
But she's the only one
who confessed at the scene,

36:15.919 --> 36:18.000
and subsequently signed a confession.

36:18.001 --> 36:19.719
So what happens now?

36:19.720 --> 36:21.880
You argue your case in the assizes.

36:21.881 --> 36:24.400
But if she loses, then...?

36:25.880 --> 36:27.880
Then I could hang.

36:35.480 --> 36:38.519
Making good on my promise.
Promise?

36:38.520 --> 36:41.799
Watching insects devour each other.

36:41.800 --> 36:44.798
Sorry to disappoint you,
but these caddisfly tend to

36:44.799 --> 36:47.398
feed on nectar, and if you don't
mind, I prefer to work...

36:47.399 --> 36:50.320
How many larvae do you
think are in this pond?

36:50.321 --> 36:53.560
A typical mass contains
up to 800 eggs.

36:54.840 --> 36:57.800
800? That's incredible.

36:59.680 --> 37:03.240
And this particular species forms
webs of debris for protection

37:03.241 --> 37:04.839
against predators.

37:04.840 --> 37:07.359
Birds, frogs, spiders...

37:07.360 --> 37:09.360
Survival of the fittest, eh?

37:13.880 --> 37:16.160
I spoke to Susie,
Norman's housekeeper

37:19.720 --> 37:21.478
I don't know what
you're talking about.

37:21.479 --> 37:22.960
She told me what she saw.

37:27.080 --> 37:29.718
What are you... going to do
with this information?

37:29.719 --> 37:32.200
I have no intention at all
to expose you.

37:32.201 --> 37:34.199
Has she told anyone else? No.

37:34.200 --> 37:36.559
How can you be sure?!
I know her.

37:36.560 --> 37:37.799
I'm sure.

37:37.800 --> 37:39.798
You know what could happen to me?!

37:39.799 --> 37:42.038
Please, Mr Walker, calm down.
Calm down?

37:42.039 --> 37:44.198
You're not the one facing
the possibility of arrest

37:44.199 --> 37:46.558
and chemical treatments!
Neither are you.

37:46.559 --> 37:49.180
No one else knows. No one else will.
Your secret is safe.

37:49.199 --> 37:50.910
- I haven't come here to judge.
- Then why?

37:50.910 --> 37:52.727
- You think I did it?
- Of course.

37:52.765 --> 37:55.154
It must be me - the deviant.

37:55.181 --> 37:57.299
It's a sad fact that many
victims are killed

37:57.300 --> 37:59.421
by the people who
are supposed to love them.

37:59.422 --> 38:00.941
I did love him.

38:02.901 --> 38:04.381
He could be selfish.

38:05.901 --> 38:07.341
Cruel.

38:08.461 --> 38:12.261
But he was always honest.
Always... who he was.

38:13.421 --> 38:14.781
Like a little boy sometimes.

38:16.141 --> 38:17.701
I would never...

38:19.581 --> 38:22.420
I know. I'm sorry.

38:23.391 --> 38:24.831
Thank you.

38:26.471 --> 38:28.751
Did anyone else know about
you and Norman?

38:30.231 --> 38:31.911
I don't know.

38:36.631 --> 38:40.231
If you ever need to talk,
I won't try and convert you.

38:41.951 --> 38:44.471
Likewise. Hm.

39:03.391 --> 39:04.991
No!

40:01.638 --> 40:03.677
- Have you gone mad?
- I don't think so.

40:03.765 --> 40:06.843
Though, if I had, I suppose
I wouldn't know any different.

40:07.244 --> 40:09.045
What are you doing up here?

40:09.365 --> 40:11.603
I came to reset the clock.

40:11.604 --> 40:14.324
Strange you didn't do it.
You're normally so fastidious.

40:16.004 --> 40:18.604
In case you haven't noticed,
I've had a lot on my mind.

40:18.903 --> 40:20.182
I did notice.

40:22.222 --> 40:23.981
Where did you get that?

40:23.982 --> 40:25.982
The hammer?
I borrowed it from the forge.

40:25.983 --> 40:29.501
The gloves, you left up here
the other day.

40:29.502 --> 40:32.420
Explains why there weren't
any fingerprints on the hammer.

40:32.421 --> 40:33.900
What are you talking about?

40:33.901 --> 40:36.702
I think there's something dangerous
about being on high places,

40:36.703 --> 40:39.101
even to pray, don't you?

40:39.102 --> 40:42.262
Looking down on the world
and all the people in it.

40:43.822 --> 40:46.262
You came up here
to reset the clock...

40:47.782 --> 40:50.102
but something disturbed
you in your task.

40:51.222 --> 40:53.981
Something you saw so enraged you...

40:53.982 --> 40:57.301
Are you accusing me of...?
Yes.

40:57.302 --> 40:58.641
I'm afraid I am.

40:58.660 --> 40:59.859
How dare you!

40:59.860 --> 41:01.458
You will tell the truth.

41:01.459 --> 41:04.978
If, afterwards, you choose to walk
away without telling a soul,

41:04.979 --> 41:07.778
I won't stop you.
Your secret is safe with me.

41:07.779 --> 41:09.420
I give you my word on that.

41:09.421 --> 41:12.900
But you will tell the truth.
Here and now.

41:15.300 --> 41:18.139
You're far too tactile, Father.

41:18.140 --> 41:19.780
Has anyone ever told you that?

41:25.020 --> 41:26.740
The sanctity of confession.

41:28.820 --> 41:31.580
I purge myself,
you let me go Scot free.

41:35.380 --> 41:36.980
You're a fool.

41:38.180 --> 41:41.900
I don't mind playing the fool,
if it leads me to the truth.

41:46.660 --> 41:49.180
Yes, I took the hammer.

42:00.060 --> 42:02.860
My only intention
was to reset the clock.

42:09.620 --> 42:12.140
Poker game still on
for next weekend?

42:17.700 --> 42:21.020
No of fence, but right now, I don't
need the fawnings of a sycophant.

42:22.140 --> 42:23.620
What do you need?

42:59.300 --> 43:01.859
I could forgive him almost anything.

43:01.860 --> 43:04.620
Lust, avarice, even murder.

43:06.540 --> 43:08.180
But not that.

43:37.500 --> 43:39.900
'And so, in a burst
of pure passion...'

43:41.900 --> 43:44.300
'..the hammer flew from my hand.'

43:45.900 --> 43:50.459
It felt so good,
because I knew my hand was guided.

43:50.460 --> 43:53.060
I was but a vessel
of the Lord's will.

43:53.061 --> 43:55.700
His agent. It was what He wanted.

43:57.180 --> 43:58.819
How could it not be so?

43:58.820 --> 44:02.939
From up here, what's
the alternative? Chance? Luck?

44:02.940 --> 44:04.780
There's no such thing.

44:06.380 --> 44:09.220
Everything has order.
Everything has meaning.

44:09.221 --> 44:12.380
This was divine intervention.

44:28.620 --> 44:31.379
Everything all right? I'll be fine.

44:31.380 --> 44:33.860
Can't let my brother's
shenanigans ruin the day.

44:43.540 --> 44:47.339
Yes, my brother is dead.

44:47.340 --> 44:50.339
But it was by God's hands, not mine.

44:50.340 --> 44:51.740
I shall not repent.

44:52.940 --> 44:56.298
Yes, but why the guilty conscience?
I have no such thing.

44:56.299 --> 44:58.538
It's why you didn't reset the clock,

44:58.539 --> 45:01.778
because you couldn't face
coming to the scene of the crime.

45:01.779 --> 45:05.260
I answer to one higher power
and He will judge me righteous.

45:05.261 --> 45:09.859
Righteous? Using His name
to justify your malice?

45:09.876 --> 45:11.195
No.

45:11.196 --> 45:13.354
Your actions were yours
and yours alone.

45:13.355 --> 45:15.676
Look into your heart,
you know it's true.

45:17.716 --> 45:21.516
Thank you for the counsel, Father.
I'll be leaving now.

45:21.517 --> 45:23.236
You can still be saved.

45:25.116 --> 45:26.556
And so can Elizabeth.

45:28.356 --> 45:31.074
Is it God's will
that she hangs for your crime?

45:31.075 --> 45:32.754
They'll see she's innocent.

45:32.755 --> 45:34.596
Are you willing
to take that chance?

45:34.597 --> 45:35.915
God will save her.

45:35.916 --> 45:39.316
God is not your scapegoat!

45:46.916 --> 45:50.635
If you have a shred of
conscience left in you,

45:50.636 --> 45:52.276
you will do the right thing.

46:03.636 --> 46:04.996
You're right, Father.

46:07.436 --> 46:08.996
I'm a wicked man.

46:11.236 --> 46:14.236
You can be saved if
that's what you want.

46:33.796 --> 46:35.436
You've done the right thing.

46:53.716 --> 46:55.715
I'll ride with him, if I may.

46:55.716 --> 46:57.236
I owe you that much.

47:08.156 --> 47:09.996
Morning. Morning.

47:11.316 --> 47:13.956
Lady Felicia,
you look positively radiant.

47:13.983 --> 47:16.341
How are your vocal chords
this morning?

47:16.426 --> 47:19.306
Ready to delight the congregation
with my Amazing Grace.

47:19.307 --> 47:20.345
Can't wait.

47:20.346 --> 47:21.986
Good morning. Good morning.

47:21.987 --> 47:26.745
Susie. What you think I've done now?
Chopped off somebody's head?

47:26.746 --> 47:30.945
By way of an apology for thinking
you were a murderer

47:30.946 --> 47:34.946
I got one of the girls at the camp
to teach me how to make it.

47:39.266 --> 47:43.065
Mmm. Not bad, for old English woman.

47:43.066 --> 47:47.065
Irish! Oh, and thank you, I suppose.

47:47.066 --> 47:50.064
If you like, I could teach you
how to make

47:50.106 --> 47:52.587
my award-winning strawberry scones.
Hmm.

47:53.907 --> 47:56.605
Ah! Mrs Barnes and Mr Barnes.

47:56.645 --> 48:00.347
Ah well, don't get your hopes up, Father.
I'm just here for the music.

48:00.430 --> 48:02.110
You won't be disappointed.

48:02.111 --> 48:03.910
See you in there.

48:05.310 --> 48:07.710
Father, I just wanted to say...
No need.
