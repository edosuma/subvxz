00:12.200 --> 00:14.088
"Previously on" 24.

00:14.184 --> 00:18.441
- What happened, Sherry?
- "I went to the house to speak toJulia."

00:18.536 --> 00:21.448
Alan interrupted us.
There was an argument...

00:21.575 --> 00:23.464
and... he had a heart attack.

00:23.559 --> 00:25.576
You stood there
and you watched a man die.

00:25.704 --> 00:29.192
Complex problems sometimes have
the simplest solutions, Wayne.

00:29.289 --> 00:31.240
Sherry, we can't
cover this thing up.

00:31.368 --> 00:33.640
We can and we will.

00:33.735 --> 00:35.432
The deal was we get paid in full.

00:35.528 --> 00:37.801
The deal changed
when you went down to Mexico.

00:37.896 --> 00:41.672
After you've hit the hotel,
you'll get the rest of your money.

00:42.920 --> 00:45.289
Where's the virus, you son of a bitch?

00:45.385 --> 00:47.561
You're too late, Jack.

00:47.657 --> 00:49.512
- We've got Amador.
- What about the virus?

00:49.608 --> 00:51.497
I think we got
a high-probability target.

00:51.625 --> 00:54.728
- What is it?
- The Chandler Plaza Hotel on Wilshire Boulevard.

00:54.824 --> 00:57.671
- How can I help you?
- There's been a threat made against your hotel.

00:57.799 --> 01:00.841
As of this moment, it's very important you not
allow anybody in or out of the structure.

01:00.937 --> 01:02.473
What's the nature
of the threat?

01:02.601 --> 01:05.576
The release
of an infectious substance inside the hotel.

01:05.705 --> 01:10.312
This virus gets out,
you die just like everyone else.

01:10.408 --> 01:13.704
Gael, the virus is in
the central ventilation unit.

01:23.112 --> 01:27.529
The following takes place
between 4:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m.

01:32.200 --> 01:34.089
Mr. Phillips, this is Agent Ortega.

01:34.216 --> 01:37.129
The toxic substance has been
released into the forced-air unit.

01:37.257 --> 01:39.176
My God.

01:39.304 --> 01:42.472
We need to shut down the unit.
Where's the air-conditioning control panel?

01:42.568 --> 01:45.896
On your left, there's a row of fuses
running down the right side of the panel.

01:46.024 --> 01:48.393
One for each floor.

01:48.489 --> 01:51.592
Look, this toxic release, how bad is it?

01:53.609 --> 01:55.464
Agent Ortega.

01:55.561 --> 01:58.664
Just taking precautions, Mr. Phillips.

02:04.105 --> 02:06.088
How much of the virus was released?

02:06.217 --> 02:10.473
Enough to kill everyone in the building.

02:10.570 --> 02:13.097
Did you plant vials anywhere else?

02:13.193 --> 02:15.593
Don't you get it?
We're all going to die.

02:15.720 --> 02:17.448
Did you plant any other vials?

02:17.545 --> 02:20.169
My assignment was the hotel.

02:21.801 --> 02:25.385
- So there are others?
- Yes.

02:25.481 --> 02:27.370
How many?

02:27.465 --> 02:31.914
Eleven. But I don't know where they are.

02:35.689 --> 02:38.345
Keep an eye on him.

02:41.097 --> 02:43.689
- Dessler.
- Michelle, what's the status?

02:43.786 --> 02:46.761
Alvers planted a vial containing the
Cordilla virus in the ventilation system.

02:46.888 --> 02:51.016
It was on a timing device,
and it went off as Gael was trying to disarm it.

02:51.112 --> 02:53.481
- He was in direct contact?
- Yeah.

02:53.577 --> 02:57.544
He's shutting down the system now, but we
have to assume it's permeated the building.

02:57.642 --> 03:01.610
Michelle, within 14 hours, anybody exposed
to the virus will become symptomatic.

03:01.705 --> 03:03.593
They'll infect whoever
they come in contact with.

03:04.650 --> 03:07.081
Yeah. I know.

03:07.209 --> 03:11.914
No one can be allowed to leave the building.
We have to impose a total quarantine.

03:12.009 --> 03:13.897
We'll scramble a code 6 perimeter.

03:14.025 --> 03:16.041
We have to be careful about this, Tony.

03:16.169 --> 03:19.145
If these people realize what's going on,
there'll be a widespread panic.

03:19.273 --> 03:22.473
Right. Our people will hold a hundred-yard
radius. Stay out of sight.

03:22.570 --> 03:25.353
And L.A.P.D. And Health Services
will move in adjacent to the hotel.

03:25.449 --> 03:30.314
Good. The vial that Alvers planted?
He said there are 11 more.

03:30.441 --> 03:33.353
- Alvers told you this?
- I just left him.

03:33.481 --> 03:37.514
You just left him? Michelle,
he could've been exposed to the virus.

03:37.610 --> 03:39.434
How'd he get outside the hotel?

03:41.322 --> 03:43.688
Michelle?

03:43.784 --> 03:48.041
He didn't leave the hotel.
He's still in the basement.

03:49.577 --> 03:53.226
- Are you inside?
- Yeah.

03:53.322 --> 03:56.777
What the hell
you doing in there?

03:56.906 --> 04:00.105
I wasn't trying to be a hero, Tony.
It was the only decision I could make.

04:00.201 --> 04:04.298
All right. How far away are you
from the ventilation room?

04:04.393 --> 04:07.562
- I'm not sure.
- Okay, look. Health Services
is bringing protective gear.

04:07.657 --> 04:10.602
I want you to put in on as soon as they get
there. If we can get you outside the hotel...

04:10.730 --> 04:12.906
- we can isolate you until...
- Tony. Tony, I can't leave.

04:13.001 --> 04:16.778
- Are you listening to me?
I'm ordering you to get out.
- That's an order I can't obey.

04:16.904 --> 04:19.594
As it is there are only
seven other agents, including Gael...

04:19.689 --> 04:22.026
and a hotel full of people that need to be
contained and controlled.

04:22.120 --> 04:25.097
Communications, testing procedures,
it all has to be coordinated...

04:25.226 --> 04:27.594
and I am the ranking officer.

04:27.690 --> 04:32.298
- Michelle, look...
- If I've been exposed,
there's nothing anyone can do.

04:36.170 --> 04:38.538
Alvers said there were 11 more vials.

04:38.634 --> 04:40.714
He said he doesn't know
where they are. I believe him.

04:42.825 --> 04:47.274
- Tony?
- Yeah.

04:47.370 --> 04:51.146
I have to go. Call me when you have
a working protocol.

05:14.025 --> 05:16.874
- Can I have a moment alone?
- Yes, sir.

05:24.906 --> 05:27.370
You and I both know
I don't have a lot of time here.

05:27.498 --> 05:30.474
I need to know who you're working for,
who's behind this.

05:30.601 --> 05:33.386
You said he knows me?
Just give me a name.

05:33.482 --> 05:38.699
Do what you want to me.
I'm telling you nothing.

05:38.826 --> 05:42.922
We found the incubator with
the virus in it in the room next door.

05:43.018 --> 05:46.187
If you don't tell me
what I need to know...

05:46.283 --> 05:48.874
I'll put you in there,
and I'll open it up.

05:48.971 --> 05:52.714
Then I'll die. But I won't talk.

05:55.082 --> 05:57.931
- Bauer.
- Jack, this is Chappelle.

05:58.026 --> 06:01.418
The virus has been released into the ventilation
system of the Chandler Plaza Hotel.

06:01.546 --> 06:05.290
Alvers says there are 11 other vials,
but won't or can't tell us where they are.

06:05.386 --> 06:07.626
Amador's our only other link, Jack.

06:07.722 --> 06:10.570
He says whoever's behind this knows me,
but he's too afraid to give me a name.

06:10.698 --> 06:12.874
Is it someone you worked
with or against?

06:12.971 --> 06:14.410
That's what we're trying to figure out.

06:14.538 --> 06:17.482
- Bring Amador back to C.T.U.
- Ryan, we don't have time.

06:17.610 --> 06:20.075
We don't know when the 11 other vials
are going to be released.

06:20.203 --> 06:22.218
We'll put him in a room with Richards.

06:22.347 --> 06:26.122
You put Nina in a room with Richards. You
got no information and three dead agents.

06:26.251 --> 06:29.515
Please, you're gonna have to let me handle this.
You're gonna have to trust me.

06:29.610 --> 06:33.226
- All right.
- Jack.

06:33.323 --> 06:37.003
- We got some readings off the incubator.
- That was Ryan.

06:37.099 --> 06:40.874
The virus has been released at the Chandler
Plaza Hotel. There's 11 other vials.

06:40.970 --> 06:44.650
We don't know where they are, and we don't
know when they're gonna be released.

06:44.746 --> 06:49.484
- He probably does.
- He says he'd rather be dead than talk.
I believe him.

06:49.579 --> 06:52.842
It's not gonna matter though.
As soon as we have his boss in custody...

06:52.937 --> 06:55.787
we'll turn him over as a witness.

06:55.884 --> 06:58.955
- Always thinking, aren't you, Jack?
- Shut up. Take the wall.

07:10.090 --> 07:11.724
Knees.

07:17.931 --> 07:19.915
We'll be right back.

07:37.259 --> 07:40.107
The powder was ground into particles
small enough to suspend it in the air.

07:40.202 --> 07:42.090
It's like an aerosol.

07:42.186 --> 07:44.330
But most of the windows at
the Chandler Plaza Hotel don't open...

07:44.426 --> 07:47.723
which means the contaminated air
would just circulate within the hotel.

07:47.819 --> 07:50.187
We could contain it.

07:51.851 --> 07:55.147
- Tony, it's Nicole Duncan.
- You on your way to the hotel?

07:55.275 --> 07:59.115
Yeah. We're loading up. We'll be there as fast
as we can. What's the status of your people?

07:59.243 --> 08:01.130
They're setting up a covert perimeter.

08:01.227 --> 08:03.819
Okay. We're bringing a mobile lab
to test the people inside the hotel.

08:03.915 --> 08:06.763
But that can only be accomplished if
the situation is stable.

08:06.860 --> 08:08.971
Yeah, uh,
Michelle's got that covered.

08:09.067 --> 08:12.588
She's inside the hotel, unprotected?

08:12.683 --> 08:16.139
Yeah. Look, I'll get back to you.

08:16.267 --> 08:19.436
Here's the protocol:
Total containment inside the hotel...

08:19.531 --> 08:21.707
and no one's allowed to
leave or communicate with the outside.

08:21.804 --> 08:24.779
Health Services will establish
an adjacent perimeter.

08:24.907 --> 08:26.794
L.A.P.D. will move in
as soon as the area's deemed safe.

08:26.892 --> 08:30.795
All right. Have they been given degree-of-force
parameters in case someone tries to leave?

08:30.923 --> 08:34.092
- No. That's your call.
- One person gets out...

08:34.188 --> 08:37.515
it could start a ripple effect of disease
transmission throughout the city.

08:39.307 --> 08:44.044
Orders are shoot to kill anyone
who attempts to leave. No exceptions.

08:47.723 --> 08:51.692
Michelle. So all the exits
have been secured.

08:51.788 --> 08:53.931
Good. We need to shut down
the elevators and the phone system.

08:54.026 --> 08:57.325
- It's that serious?
- Potentially? Yes.

08:57.451 --> 09:00.363
For now, no one can leave the building.
Our first priority is to prevent a panic.

09:00.491 --> 09:02.859
Shutting down hotel operations,
that'll create one...

09:02.955 --> 09:04.812
and people still have
their cell phones.

09:04.908 --> 09:06.636
We're directing
a jamming signal at the hotel.

09:06.732 --> 09:08.971
How do you stay in contact with C.T.U. If
the cell phones are jammed?

09:09.067 --> 09:12.171
Our phones operate on pinhole frequency.
We won't be affected.

09:12.268 --> 09:14.635
Is anyone going to survive this?

09:14.763 --> 09:17.131
That's what we're here to ensure.

09:17.228 --> 09:19.659
Look, we're going to
rely on your leadership, Mr. Phillips.

09:19.787 --> 09:22.988
You and your employees will be our
first line of defense. Okay?

09:23.084 --> 09:25.452
We also need to shut down
the fire alarm.

09:25.548 --> 09:29.323
It's hardwired to the main grid.
It has to be shut down one node at a time.

09:31.853 --> 09:34.444
- I'll take care of it.
- Thank you.

09:36.011 --> 09:38.955
We've probably got an hour or
so before people start waking up.

09:39.083 --> 09:41.388
- Where's Alvers?
- He's downstairs with Peterson.

09:41.484 --> 09:44.396
He gave up nothing except that
there are more vials... somewhere.

09:54.924 --> 10:00.076
Gael, I know you wouldn't have been
exposed to the virus if it wasn't for me.

10:00.173 --> 10:03.788
You didn't have us do anything
we wouldn't have done on our own.

10:17.484 --> 10:19.212
- Margolis?
- Hmm?

10:19.308 --> 10:21.548
I'm gonna need you to stay for a while.

10:21.644 --> 10:23.852
I can't put in O.T.
My wife's a week overdue.

10:23.948 --> 10:26.636
Uh, listen.

10:26.732 --> 10:29.068
The ventilation system may have
released an irritant into the air...

10:29.164 --> 10:32.365
and I need available personnel to deal with
the guests in case there's a reaction.

10:32.460 --> 10:35.212
- I'm not a doctor. What can I do?
- The health department people...

10:35.308 --> 10:38.604
they are on their way, and I promise I will
get you out of here as soon as I can.

11:12.300 --> 11:15.212
This is Bauer.

11:15.341 --> 11:18.796
- Dad, it's me. Amador's left the building.
- "Which way is he headed?"

11:18.924 --> 11:21.292
- Hang on. I'm triangulating him now.
- We're on. Hurry, Kim.

11:21.421 --> 11:24.045
I got him. He's heading south
on Western at 16th.

11:24.141 --> 11:26.157
Okay. We're on our way.

11:43.213 --> 11:45.644
How many people in the hotel?

11:45.772 --> 11:49.998
- About a thousand.
- All right. Call the governor.

11:50.093 --> 11:52.589
If this thing spreads,
and there's a citywide panic...

11:52.717 --> 11:55.884
he needs to be ready to mobilize
the state troopers and the National Guard.

11:55.980 --> 11:58.830
Yes, Mr. President.

11:58.957 --> 12:01.868
But, I want him to hold off the order
until he hears from us.

12:01.996 --> 12:04.716
Okay.

12:06.189 --> 12:08.013
- "Oh, sorry, Wayne."
- Hi.

12:09.869 --> 12:12.781
You look tired.

12:12.909 --> 12:15.086
Uh, David...

12:15.181 --> 12:19.213
I'm bringing you a problem,
but I'm also bringing you a solution.

12:19.309 --> 12:21.485
Let's hear the problem.

12:21.581 --> 12:27.149
Julia Milliken. She was interviewed
by the police about Alan's death...

12:27.245 --> 12:29.133
and she's claiming
I had something to do with it.

12:30.957 --> 12:34.765
- Did you?
- Does that really matter?

12:34.893 --> 12:38.284
Only you could say that, Sherry.

12:38.412 --> 12:41.869
You know, you always claim
to want the truth...

12:41.997 --> 12:43.886
but your whole life, you've been
surrounded by people...

12:44.013 --> 12:46.318
like me and Wayne
who've protected you from it.

12:46.413 --> 12:50.477
- I never asked to be protected.
- That may be true, but the fact
remains you have been.

12:50.573 --> 12:54.221
Well, tonight,
I'm gonna take you at your word.

12:54.316 --> 12:56.684
I'm actually going to
tell you the truth.

12:56.781 --> 12:59.341
Thank you.

13:01.678 --> 13:06.285
I was with Julia Milliken
when Alan had his heart attack.

13:06.381 --> 13:09.357
She was going to give him
his medicine, and I stopped her.

13:09.485 --> 13:11.373
We both watched him die.

13:13.804 --> 13:17.038
- That's murder.
- Then Julia couldn't keep her mouth shut.

13:17.133 --> 13:20.108
She told the police everything.
They just called me a little while ago...

13:20.237 --> 13:21.932
and I told them...

13:22.029 --> 13:26.829
I told them that I was with you
at the time of Alan's death.

13:26.957 --> 13:30.893
So I expect they'll be
contacting you to verify my story.

13:31.022 --> 13:35.533
- And you expect me to do that?
- Oh, David. It would be
a serious mistake not to.

13:37.581 --> 13:40.973
Because if you don't, I will tell them
that I was acting on your behalf.

13:41.102 --> 13:43.438
No one's gonna believe
that I asked you to kill Alan Milliken.

13:43.534 --> 13:47.949
No. But maybe they'll believe that
you were having a problem with him.

13:48.078 --> 13:51.213
That you told me to take
all necessary measures to solve it.

13:51.309 --> 13:53.518
Now that's a nice sound bite for
the media, don't you think?

13:53.613 --> 13:57.581
- "Take all necessary measures"?
- I never used those words.

13:57.678 --> 14:01.613
Well, think it over, David.

15:00.174 --> 15:02.061
Okay, Tony. I've got you on speaker.

15:02.157 --> 15:05.838
We're on Hoover headed south, running
parallel to Amador's position on Vermont.

15:05.933 --> 15:09.103
Yeah. We've got you both.
Where'd you put the transponder?

15:09.198 --> 15:12.174
- In a bandage on his hand.
- You know, this could all backfire, Jack.

15:12.302 --> 15:14.701
We didn't have a choice.
We had to let him believe that he'd escaped.

15:14.829 --> 15:18.607
I'm just saying while you're tied up following
him, he may be just be heading out of town.

15:18.734 --> 15:21.358
No. Whoever Amador's working for
has got connections all around the world.

15:21.454 --> 15:24.367
- He's gonna need his help to get out of here.
- You want some backup?

15:24.495 --> 15:27.247
No. There's not very many cars on the road.
If we get any closer, he'll make us.

15:27.342 --> 15:32.078
Did Michelle compile the list of all the
contacts I've had over the last five years?

15:32.173 --> 15:35.022
I had to put Chloe on it.

15:35.119 --> 15:38.446
Michelle's inside
the Chandler Plaza Hotel.

15:42.094 --> 15:45.646
I'm sorry, Tony. Look, we think
the virus has been altered.

15:45.742 --> 15:48.590
- Altered how?
- It was combined with another chemical.

15:48.685 --> 15:50.735
It's on its way over
to N.H.S. To get tested now.

15:50.862 --> 15:55.182
- So, you're saying she might have a chance?
- Maybe. I hope so.

15:55.310 --> 15:58.958
Look, Tony, we'll get back to you
as soon as we've got anything, okay?

16:05.551 --> 16:08.943
- Yes.
- It's Amador.

16:09.070 --> 16:12.238
I was detained by some C.T.U. Agents.

16:12.334 --> 16:14.575
They put me through hell
trying to force me to give you up.

16:14.670 --> 16:18.447
- Did you?
- Of course not. I need a way out of the country.

16:18.543 --> 16:21.838
Of course.

16:21.934 --> 16:24.719
Was Jack Bauer one of the agents?

16:24.815 --> 16:26.255
Yes.

16:29.390 --> 16:32.686
I need you to be certain
you're not being followed before we meet.

16:34.159 --> 16:36.656
- You know what to do.
- Understood.

16:36.782 --> 16:39.886
Good. Call me when you're sure.

16:53.614 --> 16:57.550
- You have the location?
- When do you want it released?

16:57.678 --> 17:01.935
This will ring twice. Once you set
the timer, make sure it's destroyed.

17:19.183 --> 17:22.414
- How long before you can move in?
- About half an hour.

17:22.510 --> 17:26.926
All right. Look, we found out that the virus was
altered. Combined with another compound.

17:27.055 --> 17:30.286
Well, until that compound's analyzed,
we have no idea what we're dealing with.

17:30.383 --> 17:34.288
What's the mortality rate among
those exposed to the virus?

17:34.416 --> 17:37.487
In its unaltered form,
approximately 90%.

17:39.727 --> 17:44.335
Look, if somebody was
exposed for just a short time...

17:44.430 --> 17:46.255
would leaving the hotel
make a difference?

17:46.352 --> 17:48.559
I mean... Look, I know
I'm not making sense here...

17:48.655 --> 17:50.478
Once you're exposed, you're exposed.

17:50.575 --> 17:54.830
The length of exposure
has no real bearing on survivability.

17:54.959 --> 17:58.254
All right. Look.
You said 10% would survive.

17:58.383 --> 18:03.279
Now if the virus was altered, is there
a chance the percentage would go up?

18:04.942 --> 18:08.911
It's possible, Tony.
We'll do everything we can for her.

18:10.863 --> 18:13.231
Yeah, thanks.

18:21.264 --> 18:23.663
- The whole floor?
- " Thirty parts per million."

18:23.822 --> 18:26.064
- " You want a reading"
on the south corridor?
- You checked the service areas?

18:26.383 --> 18:30.255
- No. I have the corridor. Stairwell.
- " Which floor?"

18:30.350 --> 18:32.623
- All levels.
- " Thirty-five parts per million."

18:32.719 --> 18:36.976
- Elevator shaft?
- " I'm getting"
inconsistent readings on that.

18:37.103 --> 18:39.311
- Okay. Well,
recheck it and get back to me.
- Copy that.

18:39.408 --> 18:41.232
Okay. Out.

18:43.311 --> 18:46.128
Floors one through five
show 30 parts per million or greater.

18:46.223 --> 18:48.399
Yeah. Same as
the rest of the hotel.

18:48.495 --> 18:50.544
Even the lobby's contaminated.

18:50.671 --> 18:54.128
Okay.

18:54.255 --> 18:57.135
I'll call C.T.U. You call N.H.S.

18:57.264 --> 18:59.087
All right.

19:06.095 --> 19:09.296
- C.T.U., Koppel. Hello?
- I'll call you back.

19:09.392 --> 19:11.216
Gael.

19:14.095 --> 19:16.591
- Gael!
- Michelle, stay back!

19:41.295 --> 19:45.071
One of my agents just started showing
symptoms. What the hell's going on?

19:45.199 --> 19:48.912
- Does it really matter?
- The incubation period
is supposed to be 14 hours!

19:49.007 --> 19:51.983
You're the chemist. What did you do?

19:54.448 --> 19:56.368
Tell me!

19:59.152 --> 20:01.936
Under one condition.

20:02.032 --> 20:03.984
You're in no position
to be making demands.

20:04.112 --> 20:05.903
I'm the only one
who knows what I did.

20:05.999 --> 20:08.752
And that dies with me
unless you do what I want.

20:12.431 --> 20:16.047
- What do you want?
- I know what the virus does.

20:16.144 --> 20:19.217
I don't wanna die like that.

20:19.312 --> 20:21.936
I'll tell you what you wanna know...

20:22.031 --> 20:25.168
if you swear you'll kill me
once the symptoms start.

20:33.265 --> 20:36.912
Come.

20:42.640 --> 20:44.593
What's the latest on the hotel?

20:44.719 --> 20:49.073
It's still unclear how much of that virus was
released or how many people were exposed.

20:49.200 --> 20:52.367
You might wanna make a preemptive
announcement on how to deal with the outbreak.

20:52.463 --> 20:55.184
No. I'm not making any announcements
until more facts are known.

20:56.977 --> 21:00.144
Listen, David. I just heard from L.A.P.D.

21:00.240 --> 21:03.409
They consider Sherry to be a flight risk.

21:03.505 --> 21:05.712
Now, David, they have
a warrant for her arrest...

21:05.809 --> 21:09.265
if you don't back her alibi that she was
with you when Milliken died.

21:09.392 --> 21:13.553
- You mean lie?
- There is nothing to think about here.

21:13.648 --> 21:16.624
Perjury and obstruction
of justice are nothing to think about?

21:16.752 --> 21:19.761
David, you have the most powerful legal
apparatus in the world at your disposal.

21:19.889 --> 21:23.665
Now you let me call the A.G. 's office
and this so-called problem disappears.

21:23.761 --> 21:27.217
No, no, no, no. It just widens
the conspiracy, and it'll never hold.

21:27.345 --> 21:30.321
Are you gonna let everything you've
accomplished... and I do mean "everything..."

21:30.449 --> 21:34.320
be destroyed because of... what...
because of Sherry's indiscretion?

21:34.448 --> 21:37.617
Listen to yourself, Wayne.
You're calling murder an indiscretion?

21:37.714 --> 21:40.752
- Oh, for God's sakes, grow up.
- Who the hell do you think you're talking to?

21:40.848 --> 21:46.353
To an ex-president, David. Unless you do
the only thing that makes sense here.

21:46.449 --> 21:49.265
Now Sherry said if she goes down,
she's gonna take you down with her.

21:49.360 --> 21:53.553
- Then do your job and make sure
that doesn't happen.
- Then stop tying my hands.

21:58.320 --> 22:02.098
I wanna see the chief of police.

22:02.225 --> 22:05.137
Damn it, David, we can stonewall them.
We can survive this.

22:05.265 --> 22:08.944
Get him out of bed
and bring him directly to me.

22:30.641 --> 22:32.465
So where are we?

22:32.560 --> 22:35.857
Caltrans just redirected all the traffic
within a two-block radius of the hotel.

22:35.984 --> 22:38.832
Chloe, how long before we have enough
agents around the hotel to keep everybody in?

22:38.930 --> 22:41.777
- We're at least a half hour away.
- Damn it.

22:41.872 --> 22:44.721
- Tony, I got Michelle on line three.
- I'll take it over here.

22:48.753 --> 22:51.441
- Hey.
- The situation's worse than we thought.

22:51.537 --> 22:55.409
- What are you talking about?
- Gael started hemorrhaging
from the nose and mouth...

22:55.537 --> 22:58.033
less than an hour after exposure.

22:58.161 --> 23:00.848
So the incubation period's
no longer 14 hours?

23:00.945 --> 23:04.721
According to Alvers, the compound he added
to the virus acts as an accelerant.

23:04.848 --> 23:06.737
Is Gael the only one showing symptoms?

23:06.865 --> 23:10.641
- As far as I know.
- Where is he?

23:10.768 --> 23:13.137
I isolated him
in a room in the basement.

23:13.234 --> 23:15.185
Were you exposed to any of his blood?

23:16.592 --> 23:20.369
No. But we tested the air
throughout the hotel.

23:20.465 --> 23:23.346
The virus is everywhere,
and I've been breathing it.

23:24.881 --> 23:27.569
Look, reinforcements are on their way.

23:27.664 --> 23:29.810
Everyone knows we need
a hard perimeter as soon as possible.

23:29.906 --> 23:34.321
- I'll get back to you.
- Michelle...

23:34.449 --> 23:36.465
We can't do this now.

23:36.593 --> 23:39.537
We have to focus on
making sure no one gets out of here.

23:39.665 --> 23:42.834
Yeah. Okay.

23:49.393 --> 23:51.857
Mr. Phillips, you gotta tell me
what's going on.

23:51.985 --> 23:54.226
- What are you talking about, Bruce?
- Don't say you don't know.

23:54.322 --> 23:56.306
There are people outside
this hotel with guns...

23:56.433 --> 23:58.865
and every door I've tried is locked.

23:58.992 --> 24:01.042
They're federal agents,
and they're dealing with the problem.

24:01.169 --> 24:03.986
What kind of problem?
Are we in trouble? Please.

24:04.081 --> 24:07.026
The only thing I can tell you is all that
they've told me. I don't know any more.

24:07.154 --> 24:09.458
- And you're sticking around?
- Look, we don't have a choice.

24:09.554 --> 24:13.266
- They have the authority to keep us here.
- What are we supposed to do?

24:13.362 --> 24:18.033
All we can do until they tell us more is
to stay calm and hope for the best.

24:18.129 --> 24:20.498
Okay?

24:23.634 --> 24:25.457
Yeah.

25:06.162 --> 25:10.098
- Yeah.
- It's Michelle.

25:10.226 --> 25:12.466
- How are you feeling?
- I'm okay. I'm all right.

25:12.562 --> 25:15.410
The bleeding stops and starts.

25:15.506 --> 25:20.241
I just feel very... very weak.

25:20.370 --> 25:24.018
Soon as N.H.S. Gets here,
they're gonna send a doctor in to see you.

25:24.115 --> 25:26.802
To track the progress of the virus.

25:26.898 --> 25:29.394
And to make you more comfortable.

25:33.874 --> 25:36.369
You gotta get 'em here soon.

25:36.498 --> 25:39.858
You're gonna have a hard time keeping
people in the hotel once they wake up.

26:03.123 --> 26:05.265
- What's that, Michelle?
- I'll call you back.

26:33.747 --> 26:36.658
- I thought the fire alarm was disconnected?
- I thought so too.

26:36.786 --> 26:39.923
- Can you shut it off?
- Yeah. I'm on my way. I have to find the override.

26:40.018 --> 26:44.210
Get on the intercom. Tell people
it's a false alarm and to stay in their rooms.

26:44.307 --> 26:47.603
The two of you, I need you to go to
the stairwell and turn people back around.

26:47.730 --> 26:51.186
Everyone else, man the doors.
"Nobody" gets out.

27:12.467 --> 27:15.603
Look, I've double-backed on my route
a few times now. There's no one on my tail.

27:15.699 --> 27:19.955
- You're sure?
- Yeah. The streets are empty. Just bring me in.

27:20.051 --> 27:23.634
- How far are you from the location?
- I'll be there soon.

27:23.730 --> 27:27.314
Park a few blocks away and walk.
Look for a silver Ford.

27:27.411 --> 27:30.579
Dorman will be waiting
with your travel documents.

27:30.676 --> 27:33.362
Look, I'll need some cash to
help me get out of the country.

27:33.459 --> 27:37.682
- He'll have that for you as well.
- Good.

27:40.851 --> 27:44.178
Amador's making a U-turn.
He's heading downtown.

27:44.306 --> 27:48.083
We've got him. Bring in the follow teams.
Tell them to stay at a safe distance.

27:48.179 --> 27:51.443
Amador's not gonna lead us to who
he's working for unless he feels absolutely safe.

27:51.539 --> 27:53.618
Coordinating the follow teams now.

27:53.746 --> 27:56.244
Copy.

28:02.803 --> 28:06.420
- Madison, what's your status?
- Lower level is all secure.

28:08.627 --> 28:12.018
- "Okay. Hold your position."
- " Copy that."

28:12.147 --> 28:15.123
Attention hotel guests...

28:15.251 --> 28:20.468
It was a false alarm. If you all go back
to your rooms, everything will be okay.

28:20.596 --> 28:23.603
I deactivated the alarm node
but the system still has to cycle down.

28:23.731 --> 28:25.620
- Well, how long is it gonna take?
- I don't know.

28:25.715 --> 28:27.603
- "Are you sure?"
- "I wanna know what the hell is going on."

28:27.731 --> 28:29.651
That's right.
What's going on?

28:29.780 --> 28:33.075
- Everything is fine. You just need to relax.
- Everything doesn't "seem" fine.

28:33.203 --> 28:36.051
It was a false alarm. It's no problem.

28:36.180 --> 28:38.771
- Why's this guy telling me I can't go outside?
- Sir, I need you to go upstairs.

28:38.899 --> 28:42.836
- No. Not until someone tells me what is going on.
- " Yeah, that's right."

28:42.964 --> 28:45.043
What are those people doing outside?
I saw them from my room.

28:45.171 --> 28:48.789
- They're wearing gas masks.
- You can't keep us in here. I want an explanation.

28:48.884 --> 28:53.235
Please. Please. If I can have your attention,
I will explain the situation.

28:53.364 --> 28:56.756
I am a federal agent.

28:56.884 --> 29:00.532
I am here because about
half an hour ago...

29:00.628 --> 29:04.403
a toxic substance was released outside
around this building.

29:04.499 --> 29:06.388
Why didn't you tell us before?

29:06.483 --> 29:08.628
Because we didn't want people
to panic, rush outside...

29:08.724 --> 29:10.804
and expose themselves
to this dangerous substance.

29:10.932 --> 29:15.220
Now, you are safe
as long as you stay inside this hotel.

29:15.348 --> 29:19.443
But, until we get a cleanup crew out there,
it is not safe to go outside.

29:19.539 --> 29:21.842
Well, how long are we gonna be here?

29:21.939 --> 29:27.155
- Why don't the phones work?
- Please, please. We will work this all out.
I promise you.

29:27.251 --> 29:31.124
If you go back to your rooms,
everything will be okay.

29:31.252 --> 29:33.396
- " Please..."
- Excuse me. Agent Dessler...

29:33.492 --> 29:35.764
- "calmly go back to your rooms."
- Someone got a fire door open.

29:35.860 --> 29:38.036
- Where?
- Signal came from the west side of the hotel.

29:38.131 --> 29:40.532
All those emergency exits
feed the same corridor.

29:40.660 --> 29:43.220
All right, I need you to stay here
and help my people out. How do I get there?

29:43.348 --> 29:45.299
Down this corridor,
to the right and downstairs.

29:45.427 --> 29:48.148
All right, people.
Let's head back up to your rooms.

29:48.244 --> 29:51.029
- You heard the lady. There is no problem.
- Like hell there isn't.

29:51.124 --> 29:55.028
Please, everyone. It's gonna be just fine.
Please. Please, ma'am?

29:55.156 --> 29:57.684
Back to your room. Please, everyone,
it's gonna be just fine.

30:01.172 --> 30:04.307
Stop right there!

30:04.404 --> 30:06.580
I'm gettin' out of here.

30:08.372 --> 30:10.292
I'm a federal agent.
Now drop the gun.

30:10.419 --> 30:15.572
- No. I just wanna go.
- It's not safe to leave. Drop the gun.

30:15.669 --> 30:20.595
- Why isn't it safe?
- A toxic substance was released outside this hotel.

30:20.723 --> 30:23.028
- You're lying.
- No, I am not lying.

30:23.125 --> 30:25.492
No. I know about the man
in the storeroom.

30:25.588 --> 30:28.276
I know that something bad
is in this hotel.

30:31.637 --> 30:34.996
You're right. It is.

30:35.124 --> 30:39.188
- That's why you can't go outside.
- What are you talking about?

30:39.283 --> 30:42.996
Everyone in this hotel
is going to get very sick.

30:43.091 --> 30:46.420
Sick. How sick?

30:48.885 --> 30:51.189
Most of us are gonna die.

30:53.940 --> 30:57.236
- That's not possible.
- It's the truth.

30:57.332 --> 31:02.708
I just wanna get home to my wife...

31:02.837 --> 31:06.549
- My wife.
- "If you do, you'll give this to her."

31:06.645 --> 31:11.252
Anyone who leaves this hotel
will spread this disease.

31:11.348 --> 31:14.739
Tens of thousands of people could die.

31:14.869 --> 31:17.844
You don't wanna be
responsible for that, do you?

31:17.972 --> 31:21.747
Oh, God.

31:21.876 --> 31:24.725
Oh, God.

31:30.036 --> 31:33.269
Give me the gun.

31:40.821 --> 31:43.317
Now that you know,
we have to isolate you.

31:45.333 --> 31:48.244
Go sit down.

31:51.412 --> 31:54.773
- Dessler.
- We need you back in here. There is a problem.

31:54.900 --> 31:57.556
- What's going on?
- Someone just started bleeding...

31:57.652 --> 32:00.341
from the nose and mouth and blood
keeps coming and we cannot stop it.

32:23.668 --> 32:26.518
Mr. President, Chief Hendricks.

32:26.613 --> 32:27.989
Mm-hmm.

32:31.380 --> 32:33.397
- Chief Hendricks.
- Mr. President.

32:33.525 --> 32:35.252
- Please, have a seat.
- Thank you, sir.

32:36.822 --> 32:39.988
I realize this is
an irregular hour for a meeting.

32:40.085 --> 32:43.733
- The circumstances are irregular, Mr. President.
- Yes, they are.

32:43.829 --> 32:45.654
I assume you've been briefed
on the Milliken case?

32:45.749 --> 32:48.725
I know Julia Milliken stated that...

32:48.853 --> 32:51.797
Mrs. Palmer contributed
to the death of Alan Milliken...

32:51.925 --> 32:54.229
by withholding his medication.

32:54.325 --> 32:57.621
Mrs. Palmer indicated to our detectives...

32:57.717 --> 33:00.725
that she was not at the Milliken residence
this evening, that she was here with you.

33:01.909 --> 33:05.524
Mr. President, my question is...

33:07.702 --> 33:10.165
was she?

33:12.565 --> 33:14.389
Yes, she was.

33:18.006 --> 33:21.845
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Chief Hendricks.

33:23.796 --> 33:26.773
- Have a good night.
- Thank you, sir.

33:33.334 --> 33:35.349
Is there any reason
you can think of...

33:35.477 --> 33:37.973
that would've prompted
Mrs. Milliken to accuse Mrs. Palmer?

33:39.733 --> 33:43.317
People do inexplicable things
in a moment of crisis, Chief.

33:43.413 --> 33:45.749
Yeah.

33:47.509 --> 33:51.478
- Good night.
- Good night.

34:19.029 --> 34:21.237
The police chief
was just here...

34:21.333 --> 34:23.701
and I told him that you were
here with me tonight.

34:23.830 --> 34:26.614
And no one will ever know
anything different.

34:26.710 --> 34:31.158
I will.
What you've done is unforgivable.

34:31.286 --> 34:34.389
David, you called me precisely...

34:34.487 --> 34:37.462
because you needed someone
to do your dirty work.

34:37.589 --> 34:41.043
So don't turn around and just try to
wash your hands of this.

34:41.172 --> 34:43.638
Don't you dare insinuate that I knew
what you were about to do.

34:43.766 --> 34:46.742
You took a life.

34:46.870 --> 34:51.158
- It's not that clear-cut, David.
- Yes, it is.

34:51.286 --> 34:53.782
Alan Milliken is dead because of you.

34:53.909 --> 34:57.846
You needed help with Milliken,
and I gave it to you.

34:57.973 --> 35:02.102
Neither one of us had any idea that
it would work out like this.

35:02.198 --> 35:06.806
So let's not forget it did
work out... in your favor.

35:06.902 --> 35:09.590
You should be thanking me.

35:12.822 --> 35:15.125
I despise you for what you've done.

35:17.430 --> 35:20.726
And I despise my role in
helping you get away with it.

35:22.934 --> 35:25.974
Now get out of my sight.

35:46.933 --> 35:49.206
Okay, I've got him.
Are the follow cars in place?

35:49.302 --> 35:53.079
Affirmative, sir.
We have pursuit vehicles in position.

36:14.582 --> 36:16.758
Here's your money and travel papers.

36:26.070 --> 36:28.439
Move!

36:48.214 --> 36:50.101
Damn it!

36:50.198 --> 36:53.367
You get on the radio. You tell the follow
teams to cordon off this entire area.

36:53.463 --> 36:55.958
I don't want anybody coming down here
except the bomb squad and forensics.

36:56.086 --> 36:58.518
"Follow teams cordon off"
two-block perimeter around...

36:58.646 --> 37:00.214
- This is Bauer.
- Hello, Jack.

37:00.342 --> 37:04.951
I knew you were better than Amador,
but you're not better than me.

37:05.046 --> 37:09.046
- Amador said you knew me. Who is this?
- First things first, Jack.

37:09.175 --> 37:14.550
There are 11 other vials.

37:14.678 --> 37:17.527
Each containing the same amount
of virus that was released at the hotel.

37:17.654 --> 37:22.167
I'll use them the moment
my instructions aren't followed.

37:22.263 --> 37:24.087
What do you want, money?

37:24.182 --> 37:27.640
I need you to put me in touch
with a... friend of yours.

37:29.815 --> 37:34.167
" Stay calm. Go back to your rooms."

37:34.295 --> 37:37.431
- " Someone help me, please."
- Oh, my God.

37:42.582 --> 37:45.144
- Sir... I need Phillips. You'll be okay.
- " Here, we need help."

37:45.271 --> 37:49.334
They're lying to us. There's something
wrong inside the building.

37:49.430 --> 37:52.279
- It's inside the building!
- Okay. Hold on.

37:52.375 --> 37:54.615
" Sir, calm down!"

37:54.711 --> 37:57.240
Everyone out of my way.

38:00.534 --> 38:02.871
Hold it right there.

38:04.183 --> 38:07.927
Step away from the window.

38:08.022 --> 38:10.488
I said step away from the window.

38:10.615 --> 38:14.391
If you try to leave, I will shoot you.

38:22.871 --> 38:25.239
No, you won't.

39:06.007 --> 39:09.047
" Mr. President..."

39:09.175 --> 39:11.768
- "I haveJack Bauer for you."
- Thank you.

39:14.231 --> 39:16.663
- Jack.
- Mr. President.

39:16.791 --> 39:19.287
The man in possession of the Cordilla virus
has demanded to speak with you.

39:19.415 --> 39:21.016
We don't have a name on him yet, sir.

39:21.145 --> 39:24.728
But I do believe that if you don't speak
with him, he'll release more of the virus.

39:24.823 --> 39:27.608
Unfortunately, Mr. President,
right now at this time...

39:27.703 --> 39:30.264
I think you're gonna have to
give in to his demands.

39:32.856 --> 39:35.223
- I'll speak to him.
- Yes, sir. I'll connect you.

39:39.544 --> 39:42.039
You are now on
with the president.

39:42.167 --> 39:45.945
I'll make this brief.
As you are no doubt aware...

39:46.072 --> 39:48.248
I am in possession
of enough of the virus...

39:48.344 --> 39:51.319
to decimate a good portion
of the population of this country.

39:51.447 --> 39:56.184
And, as I've shown at
the Chandler Plaza Hotel...

39:57.208 --> 39:59.576
I will do so...

39:59.672 --> 40:03.545
unless you follow the instructions
you'll be receiving over the next few hours.

40:03.672 --> 40:08.568
Do you understand, Mr. President?

40:08.696 --> 40:11.065
I'm listening.

40:11.161 --> 40:15.256
You are no longer
in control of your country.

40:15.352 --> 40:17.848
And if you do not use...

40:17.975 --> 40:23.000
the full power of your office
to execute my wishes...

40:23.096 --> 40:27.031
the virus... will be released...

40:27.160 --> 40:31.000
and it will be impossible to stop.

40:32.280 --> 40:34.328
You'll be hearing from me.
