WEBVTT

00:07.268 --> 00:09.705
- You all set for tomorrow?
- 12:00 sharp. We're ready.

00:09.792 --> 00:11.054
You talking about lunch?

00:11.141 --> 00:12.838
- That sounds civilized.
- You got the memo.

00:12.925 --> 00:14.492
We're talking about
the mandatory seminar

00:14.579 --> 00:15.798
on budget protocols.

00:15.885 --> 00:17.147
Oh. Have fun with that.

00:17.234 --> 00:18.453
You're coming too, Jane.

00:18.540 --> 00:19.802
[Jane]
'You're joking, of course.'

00:19.889 --> 00:21.195
I-I don't do seminars.

00:21.282 --> 00:22.935
Well, you do when
they're mandatory.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.068
- No, I'm a consultant.
- Too bad.

00:25.155 --> 00:27.418
They're checking attendance.
You have to sign in.

00:27.505 --> 00:29.551
Oh, okay then, um..

00:29.638 --> 00:32.902
"Patrick Jane."

00:32.989 --> 00:36.253
Just, uh, copy that down for me.

00:36.340 --> 00:38.255
Forge your signature?
That's against the rules.

00:38.342 --> 00:40.605
Is it?
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

00:40.692 --> 00:42.825
- Jane.
- Lisbon.

00:42.912 --> 00:45.001
I understand your
precarious emotional state

00:45.088 --> 00:47.786
given you've just gotten your
job back and your sensitivity

00:47.873 --> 00:50.311
to the bureaucrats that
are watching your every move.

00:50.398 --> 00:52.487
- They are.
- Yes, but that's your thing.

00:52.574 --> 00:54.532
I gotta be me.
I can't change myself.

00:54.619 --> 00:57.492
No, but you can change
where you are tomorrow at 12.

00:57.579 --> 00:58.580
It's not gonna happen.

00:58.667 --> 01:00.582
You think this is funny?

01:00.669 --> 01:02.366
We got a missing child,
Marin County.

01:02.453 --> 01:04.673
Snatched from a school
bus stop two hours ago.

01:04.760 --> 01:07.806
The mother asked for us.
Rigsby will meet us downstairs.

01:07.893 --> 01:10.592
Grace, set up a command post.
Liaise with the Marin sheriff.

01:10.679 --> 01:12.159
Tell him we're on our way.

01:14.857 --> 01:18.121
- It's good to have her back.
- Mm. Yes, it is.

01:18.208 --> 01:21.037
[instrumental music]

01:25.694 --> 01:28.697
Our missing boy,
nine years old, only child.

01:28.784 --> 01:31.743
Another kid was walking to
the bus stop, he saw a vehicle

01:31.830 --> 01:34.920
peeling out with our boy
Conner Flint in it.

01:35.007 --> 01:37.227
'The man behind the wheel
was wearing a hoodie.'

01:37.314 --> 01:40.622
- Description on the vehicle?
- Big and dark.

01:40.709 --> 01:43.799
- The kid's eight years old.
- Is it a custody kidnapping?

01:43.886 --> 01:46.976
The woman was widowed two years
ago. Her husband died of cancer.

01:47.063 --> 01:51.328
Looks like there's family money.
There's no ransom demand yet.

01:51.415 --> 01:53.809
- Start with the bus stop?
- Yeah, you and Cho.

01:53.896 --> 01:55.724
Jane and I will
question the family.

02:02.948 --> 02:05.734
- What's the mother's name?
- 'Elizabeth Flint.'

02:23.795 --> 02:26.581
[indistinct chattering]

02:28.670 --> 02:30.976
[gasps]
Patrick! Oh!

02:31.063 --> 02:33.327
- Thank God you're here.
- Hello, Beth.

02:34.980 --> 02:36.068
[Beth sighs]

02:38.027 --> 02:39.898
I have everything
ready for the reading.

02:39.985 --> 02:42.205
I'll do everything
I can to help, I promise

02:42.292 --> 02:46.035
but, uh, I need to you know,
I'm-I'm not a psychic anymore.

02:46.122 --> 02:48.603
What? Wh...what do you mean?

02:48.690 --> 02:53.173
Well, I mean, I'm not...well,
I-I never really was a psychic.

02:53.260 --> 02:55.349
No, I'm not...no...
what are you saying?

02:55.436 --> 02:59.657
No, I-I know that-that
you-you are. Look, you..

02:59.744 --> 03:03.052
Please help me find Conner. You
have a connection with him--

03:03.139 --> 03:04.836
- Beth.
- So...can we get started?

03:04.923 --> 03:07.578
- I have this locket and--
- Excuse me, ma'am. I'm sorry.

03:07.665 --> 03:09.319
- I'm so happy you're here.
- Ma'am.

03:09.406 --> 03:11.452
- Would you excuse us?
- I'm glad you're here.

03:11.539 --> 03:12.888
I-I'm sorry.

03:22.811 --> 03:23.942
[exhales deeply]

03:25.683 --> 03:27.381
She's an old client.

03:27.468 --> 03:28.991
Uh, yeah.

03:29.078 --> 03:30.993
We don't have
time for this mess.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.821
That boy is out
there somewhere

03:32.908 --> 03:36.520
and this psychic
stuff is a distraction.

03:36.607 --> 03:38.087
I think you'd better leave.

03:38.174 --> 03:39.306
Can't say I disagree.

03:41.786 --> 03:43.527
Hello. Is Beth inside?

03:43.614 --> 03:45.486
And you are..

03:45.573 --> 03:47.879
[Lisbon]
'I'm Agent Lisbon.
We're with the CBI.'

03:47.966 --> 03:50.273
Oh. Nathan Glass.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.319
When Beth told me about Conner

03:52.406 --> 03:54.582
I came immediately
to see what I could sense.

03:54.669 --> 03:56.671
- Sense?
- I'm Beth's spiritual advisor.

03:56.758 --> 03:58.542
- A psychic?
- She's expecting me.

03:58.629 --> 03:59.935
Excuse me.

04:05.070 --> 04:06.333
Second thought.

04:11.686 --> 04:14.558
[theme music]

04:21.478 --> 04:23.959
[indistinct chattering]

04:25.613 --> 04:28.485
[dog barking]

04:31.096 --> 04:34.012
[indistinct chattering]

04:50.681 --> 04:54.337
Forensics found the kid's
phone in the bushes over there.

04:54.424 --> 04:57.209
- Has the amber alert gone live?
- 'Yep. No tips yet.'

04:57.297 --> 04:59.777
Deputies shut down the streets
after Conner disappeared.

04:59.864 --> 05:01.562
There's some unpaved
trails in the woods

05:01.649 --> 05:03.128
'that a vehicle
could get through.'

05:03.215 --> 05:04.347
'We got checkpoints up, but..'

05:08.308 --> 05:10.527
[Cho on phone]
We get a ransom demand yet?

05:10.614 --> 05:12.573
No, and I don't
think we're going to.

05:12.660 --> 05:14.836
There've been two other
abductions in the bay area

05:14.923 --> 05:16.620
with a similar MO,
young boys snatched

05:16.707 --> 05:18.492
while waiting for the bus.

05:18.579 --> 05:21.103
But there were balloon animals
found at those scenes.

05:21.190 --> 05:23.410
'They think that's how
the guy lured the kids.'

05:23.497 --> 05:25.063
What happened to those boys?

05:25.150 --> 05:27.022
ME estimates both
boys were strangled

05:27.109 --> 05:29.241
approximately 12 hours
after they vanished.

05:33.028 --> 05:34.986
Which means Conner has
only about eight hours.

05:35.073 --> 05:37.946
[indistinct chattering]

05:42.080 --> 05:45.867
I talked with Conner
about safety...all the time.

05:45.954 --> 05:48.217
You know,
i-if a stranger grabs you

05:48.304 --> 05:50.828
just kick, punch, scream,
anything to get away.

05:50.915 --> 05:53.265
You know, I-I...I told him.

05:53.353 --> 05:57.313
Shh. It's not your fault.
You taught him well.

05:57.400 --> 06:00.925
Everyone who knows you
knows that you're a perfect mom.

06:01.012 --> 06:02.666
How well did you know Conner?

06:02.753 --> 06:05.016
Beth and I have worked
together for two years

06:05.103 --> 06:07.149
'since her husband passed over.'

06:07.236 --> 06:09.673
I feel like I've
watched him grow up.

06:09.760 --> 06:13.242
Conner's such a great kid.
He's kind and funny and smart.

06:13.329 --> 06:16.332
Beth, uh, did Conner always
take the bus to school?

06:16.419 --> 06:18.726
It-it was Deke's idea,
uh, my brother.

06:18.813 --> 06:22.599
Um, he thought
it would do Conner good.

06:22.686 --> 06:24.601
Deke Hutton. He lives here.

06:24.688 --> 06:27.952
Um...yes, ever since James died

06:28.039 --> 06:31.173
'and-and I-I agreed
with him...about the bus.'

06:32.435 --> 06:34.568
You know, I-I didn't want

06:34.655 --> 06:36.657
Conner to grow up sheltered.

06:36.744 --> 06:38.180
And Jonathan supported it too.

06:38.267 --> 06:40.835
Jonathan is my,
um, my grown stepson.

06:40.922 --> 06:42.402
He's, um, Conner's brother.

06:42.489 --> 06:45.274
You know, he...
actually, he owns this house.

06:45.361 --> 06:48.190
He's letting Conner and me
stay as long as we want.

06:48.277 --> 06:50.148
Nice guy.

06:50.235 --> 06:52.107
And where are
Deke and Jonathan now?

06:52.194 --> 06:56.241
Um, they're with
our...our bankers.

06:56.328 --> 07:01.595
If...if this is, uh,
a-a ransom-type thing, I..

07:01.682 --> 07:03.379
we'd need to
have a lotta cash.

07:03.466 --> 07:04.685
Yes, ifit is.

07:06.948 --> 07:09.298
You-you...you can find him.

07:09.385 --> 07:11.343
You-you, you and Nate,
you can work together.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.041
'I know that you can--'

07:13.128 --> 07:15.783
I know you can see
where he is, so..

07:15.870 --> 07:18.046
...so-so that we-we
can bring him home.

07:18.133 --> 07:20.396
Mr. Glass, would you excuse us?

07:20.483 --> 07:22.398
Beth, don't worry.
I'll be outside, okay?

07:22.485 --> 07:23.747
Okay.

07:26.620 --> 07:28.491
Beth, please have a seat.

07:30.406 --> 07:31.842
'Okay. Just breathe and relax.'

07:31.929 --> 07:34.715
I need you to hear this...okay?

07:34.802 --> 07:36.978
I'm not a psychic.

07:37.065 --> 07:38.719
I never was.

07:38.806 --> 07:41.243
I was a con artist.

07:41.330 --> 07:43.985
I took your money,
and I told you lies.

07:44.072 --> 07:45.943
- No, they-they weren't lies.
- Yes.

07:46.030 --> 07:48.946
No. No. You-you
know they weren't.

07:49.033 --> 07:50.992
No, i-if you're,
if you're not a psychic

07:51.079 --> 07:54.212
then-then why are you
working with the police?

07:54.299 --> 07:56.519
Ma'am, Mr. Jane
is working with us

07:56.606 --> 07:58.695
because he is
an excellent investigator.

07:58.782 --> 08:00.915
He's gonna be very helpful
in this. I promise.

08:03.308 --> 08:05.833
I understand.

08:05.920 --> 08:10.577
I-it must be a terrible burden,
the gift you have.

08:10.664 --> 08:12.970
Of course you have to deny it.

08:13.057 --> 08:16.321
I mean...even St. Peter
denied who he was three times.

08:16.408 --> 08:19.107
Beth, there are no such thing
as psychics. This man Glass--

08:19.194 --> 08:21.152
- It must be awful..
- He's a fraud too.

08:21.239 --> 08:22.937
...knowing what's gonna happen.
I mean, if..

08:23.024 --> 08:25.200
who's gonna live
and who's gonna die.

08:25.287 --> 08:27.855
But please, please..

08:27.942 --> 08:29.900
...pleasedon't deny your gift.

08:29.987 --> 08:32.076
Not now. No.
You have to help me.

08:32.163 --> 08:33.817
You gotta help me find Conner.

08:33.904 --> 08:35.384
Here, look, I have this locket

08:35.471 --> 08:37.604
and it has
his-his first haircut.

08:37.691 --> 08:40.215
Look. Touch this.
See if you can get a sense.

08:40.302 --> 08:41.564
- If this is--
- No, Beth.

08:41.651 --> 08:43.523
This is from his
first haircut and..

08:43.610 --> 08:44.915
- Touch this.
- No.

08:45.002 --> 08:46.526
- Mrs. Flint.
- No! My, no!

08:46.613 --> 08:49.354
My son...no! My son is missing.

08:49.441 --> 08:53.445
[sobbing]
My son is missing! You have
to find him! You have to.

08:53.533 --> 08:57.101
Mrs. Flint, please, let's just
sit down for a minute, please..

08:57.188 --> 08:59.277
Calm down, okay? It's okay.

08:59.364 --> 09:02.803
Patrick...I..

09:02.890 --> 09:05.632
[sobbing]

09:09.853 --> 09:12.900
Sources inside the Marin County
sheriff's department confirm

09:12.987 --> 09:15.206
that Conner Flint, age nine

09:15.293 --> 09:18.296
was snatched from his
school bus stop this morning.

09:18.383 --> 09:20.690
No ransom demand
has yet been made.

09:20.777 --> 09:22.953
A CBI spokesman
told this reporter

09:23.040 --> 09:25.782
that all leads and tips
are being pursued

09:25.869 --> 09:28.829
and that police are looking
for a possible suspect.

09:28.916 --> 09:31.875
[woman on TV]
'However, when we asked them
to give further information'

09:31.962 --> 09:35.226
'about who that suspect
might be, they refused.'

09:35.313 --> 09:37.359
[man on TV]
'Thanks, Debra. Keep us posted.'

09:37.446 --> 09:39.143
They'd go nuts if we told them

09:39.230 --> 09:41.319
we suspected someone who's
murdered two other boys.

09:41.406 --> 09:43.147
They're calling this
guy the balloon man.

09:43.234 --> 09:45.759
Media. Vultures.

09:45.846 --> 09:47.195
I'm checking into
pedophiles released

09:47.282 --> 09:49.023
before the first killing,
looking for any

09:49.110 --> 09:50.807
escalating violence.
Nothing so far.

09:50.894 --> 09:53.941
Good. Anything from forensics
yet on trace from the bus stop?

09:54.028 --> 09:56.552
Yeah, they say it's gonna
take at least 24 hours.

09:56.639 --> 09:59.642
[sighs]
Okay. A serial offender.
This changes our whole play.

09:59.729 --> 10:01.688
We gotta work
three cases to find him.

10:01.775 --> 10:03.733
I'll check everything
the local cops already checked.

10:03.820 --> 10:05.779
- Maybe they missed something.
- Work fast.

10:10.348 --> 10:13.525
Mr. Flint, when was the last
time you saw your brother?

10:13.613 --> 10:16.267
Uh, this morning
at breakfast.

10:16.354 --> 10:20.750
We have breakfast together,
Beth, Conner, Deke, and me.

10:20.837 --> 10:22.839
Conner had-had French toast.
Everything was fine.

10:22.926 --> 10:25.450
I-I...I can't believe this.

10:25.537 --> 10:29.063
[sighs]
How's-how's Beth doing?

10:29.150 --> 10:30.804
Mm. Not great.

10:30.891 --> 10:33.110
How long ago did
she marry your father?

10:33.197 --> 10:35.025
Um, 12 years ago.

10:35.112 --> 10:37.506
How did you feel about that?

10:37.593 --> 10:41.597
I like and respect Beth, if
that's what you're getting at.

10:41.684 --> 10:44.992
She's no wicked stepmother. I
care deeply for her and Conner.

10:45.079 --> 10:47.037
If you care,
how come you let her

10:47.124 --> 10:49.474
throw her money away
on this, uh, psychic?

10:49.561 --> 10:52.347
Never bothered you
when it was you, Mr. Jane.

10:52.434 --> 10:54.088
Yeah, I heard about you.

10:54.175 --> 10:56.003
You nearly
squeezed Beth dry.

10:56.090 --> 10:57.744
- And you are..
- Conner's uncle.

10:57.831 --> 10:59.397
- Deke Hutton.
- Mm.

10:59.484 --> 11:01.878
And you should've gone to jail,
you miserable sleazebag.

11:01.965 --> 11:05.882
Well, nice to meet you too. I'm
not sure that I'm a sleazebag.

11:05.969 --> 11:07.188
- That's enough.
- 'Miserable--'

11:07.275 --> 11:10.017
We're here to find
Conner, got it?

11:10.104 --> 11:11.714
Yeah. Sorry.

11:11.801 --> 11:13.498
We're trying to put
together Conner's morning.

11:13.585 --> 11:16.850
You dropped him off at
his school bus stop, right?

11:16.937 --> 11:18.155
Yeah.

11:18.242 --> 11:20.941
And you left him there alone?

11:21.028 --> 11:22.594
Yeah.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.684
He wanted it that way.

11:24.771 --> 11:26.250
He wanted to show
his independence.

11:26.337 --> 11:28.557
The other kids
would make fun of him

11:28.644 --> 11:31.081
if he had somebody
waiting with him.

11:31.168 --> 11:33.475
It's such a safe neighborhood.
He's always been fine.

11:33.562 --> 11:35.390
So it was routine for you

11:35.477 --> 11:38.698
to, uh, leave him
alone there?

11:38.785 --> 11:42.527
Yeah. I told you. He wanted
it that way. Beth agreed.

11:42.614 --> 11:46.096
If you think you'll pin this
on me, then you're mistaken!

11:46.183 --> 11:49.534
Typical addict, misdirected
anger, persecution complex.

11:49.621 --> 11:53.190
- Excuse me. I'm not an addict.
- Yes, you are. You both are.

11:53.277 --> 11:55.366
You, gambling, hence
the purple smudge

11:55.453 --> 11:57.934
on your thumb from
the ticket stubs at the track

11:58.021 --> 12:00.241
and your need to live off
your sister's money

12:00.328 --> 12:03.723
and you, antidepressants,
the shiny skin, the dyspepsia.

12:03.810 --> 12:08.292
Some deep emotional need...not
being fulfilled, I would guess.

12:08.379 --> 12:10.120
- Are we done here?
- Just getting started.

12:10.207 --> 12:12.557
Thank you. We are.

12:12.644 --> 12:14.081
[sighs]

12:15.038 --> 12:16.213
[Deke]
Jerk.

12:20.174 --> 12:21.479
Nice work.

12:21.566 --> 12:23.307
[Rigsby]
'I dug up possible witnesses'

12:23.394 --> 12:24.961
'in the first two cases.'

12:25.048 --> 12:26.963
A power company guy
near the first killing

12:27.050 --> 12:28.835
a teacher on the second

12:28.922 --> 12:31.402
and a neighbor
of the second kid, like that.

12:31.489 --> 12:33.840
Long shots. We'd do
better using that psychic.

12:33.927 --> 12:35.363
Thought you liked
that spiritual stuff.

12:35.450 --> 12:36.930
What about your
psychic cousin Yolanda?

12:37.017 --> 12:38.714
Yolanda's real.
That guy's a fake.

12:38.801 --> 12:41.673
- Good luck.
- You too.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.241
Mr. Walton, we understand
the day the first boy vanished

12:44.328 --> 12:46.722
you were checking a downed
power line on Martindale Road.

12:46.809 --> 12:48.289
Yep. That's what my records say.

12:48.376 --> 12:49.943
You know,
funny story about that.

12:50.030 --> 12:52.597
They told me it was
a damaged overhead conductor.

12:52.684 --> 12:55.426
Turns out it was
a blown transformer.

12:55.513 --> 12:58.429
[chuckles]
Can you imagine? I could have
taken out the entire grid.

12:58.516 --> 12:59.735
Think back.

12:59.822 --> 13:01.302
Did you happen
to notice anything

13:01.389 --> 13:03.478
on your way to or from that job

13:03.565 --> 13:05.610
or maybe this child?

13:05.697 --> 13:07.569
I'm not sure.
What's the kid's name?

13:10.398 --> 13:11.965
Reggie Miranda.

13:12.052 --> 13:13.270
He was the second victim.

13:13.357 --> 13:15.577
Your car got a flat tire
on Teer's Hill.

13:15.664 --> 13:17.361
Remember seeing
him at the bus stop?

13:17.448 --> 13:21.235
Well, that wasn't
a flat tire per se.

13:21.322 --> 13:24.151
More like, uh,
I told my girlfriend that

13:24.238 --> 13:25.892
so we'd be stranded

13:25.979 --> 13:27.458
she could get
a little friendlier

13:27.545 --> 13:30.548
which she did,
if you know what I mean.

13:30.635 --> 13:31.767
High five.

13:31.854 --> 13:34.683
Come on. Give it up.

13:34.770 --> 13:37.120
As I was leaving,
there was this black SUV

13:37.207 --> 13:38.861
nearly ran me off the road

13:38.948 --> 13:40.689
which reminds me
of another funny story..

13:43.910 --> 13:45.389
Black SUV,
power company guy says

13:45.476 --> 13:47.174
there was a ding
in the bumper.

13:47.261 --> 13:48.958
Great. That narrows it down.

13:56.792 --> 13:58.968
I think I can help you.

13:59.055 --> 14:00.796
Take my hand.

14:00.883 --> 14:02.580
I want a baby
more than anything.

14:02.667 --> 14:06.280
Shh. I know.
Just...listen.

14:09.544 --> 14:11.763
[sighs]

14:11.851 --> 14:13.156
[exhales deeply]

14:15.463 --> 14:17.726
In the beyond, Beth,
I see your baby.

14:20.642 --> 14:22.600
'He's the light of your life.'

14:22.687 --> 14:24.341
He? It's a boy.

14:24.428 --> 14:26.430
Yes, a boy.

14:28.737 --> 14:30.695
[exhales deeply]

14:30.782 --> 14:33.220
His name is Conner.

14:33.307 --> 14:34.961
Conner? That-that's
my father's name.

14:35.048 --> 14:36.092
[chuckles]

14:45.928 --> 14:47.974
A beautiful baby boy.

14:48.061 --> 14:50.890
[chuckling]

15:09.821 --> 15:12.302
'That was Conner's favorite
when he was a baby.'

15:12.389 --> 15:14.609
He doesn't play with
it anymore, but I just

15:14.696 --> 15:17.177
I can't throw it out now.
You understand.

15:17.264 --> 15:20.049
Yeah. Here.

15:20.136 --> 15:22.051
[sighs]

15:22.138 --> 15:24.662
You know, Deke thinks
I'm an idiot about you.

15:24.749 --> 15:27.839
Jonathan probably does too,
but he's too nice to say so.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.406
You know,
but they weren't there.

15:29.493 --> 15:33.019
They didn't, they didn't
see your powers at work.

15:33.106 --> 15:34.498
There was nothing to see.

15:36.631 --> 15:40.504
Women that are trying hard
to have babies often succeed

15:40.591 --> 15:45.553
and when they do, there's
a 50/50 chance that it's a boy.

15:45.640 --> 15:48.817
- It was just a good guess.
- No, you knew.

15:48.904 --> 15:52.734
And what was I to say, you
were never gonna have a child?

15:52.821 --> 15:54.997
Nobody wants
a gloomy psychic.

16:00.350 --> 16:02.787
You had a child.
You lost her.

16:02.874 --> 16:05.399
I-I read about it
in the papers.

16:05.486 --> 16:09.011
- Murdered?
- Yeah.

16:09.098 --> 16:10.186
[whispers]
I'm sorry.

16:10.273 --> 16:11.840
[whispers]
Yeah.

16:11.927 --> 16:14.756
- That's why you deny your gift?
- No.

16:14.843 --> 16:16.627
Is Conner dead too?
Please. I'm sorry.

16:16.714 --> 16:18.673
I'm sorry about before,
but please tell me.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.980
- It's just us right now--
- I-I can't tell you.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.286
[panting]
Beth. Oh, thank God.

16:23.373 --> 16:24.940
I had a flash, and, uh..

16:25.027 --> 16:27.377
[Lisbon]
Mr. Glass, I told
you to stay downstairs.

16:27.464 --> 16:29.379
Beth, I think I saw Conner.

16:29.466 --> 16:31.207
It was just a flash,
but, um..

16:31.294 --> 16:33.470
Oh, please, Beth,
don't listen to this nonsense.

16:33.557 --> 16:35.907
[Beth]
'Where's he? Where-where
is he? Is-is he alive?'

16:35.995 --> 16:38.475
I don't know.
It was just a split second.

16:38.562 --> 16:42.218
I need a vessel
or...Conner's favorite.

16:43.567 --> 16:45.569
From when he was a baby,
of course.

16:45.656 --> 16:48.224
Of course. Nice read.

16:48.311 --> 16:50.009
- Mr. Glass, let's go.
- No, Agent Lisbon.

16:50.096 --> 16:51.880
Please, no, Nate,
tell me. Go ahead.

16:51.967 --> 16:54.404
Beth, it's alright. I'm here.

16:54.491 --> 16:56.711
[sighs]
I need you to
think with me, okay?

16:56.798 --> 16:58.887
I need you to think of Conner.

16:58.974 --> 17:01.020
He's filling your heart.

17:01.107 --> 17:04.588
He's filling your mind..

17:04.675 --> 17:05.850
[inhales]

17:07.113 --> 17:08.288
Yes.

17:09.724 --> 17:11.073
Yes, I see him.

17:12.901 --> 17:15.077
[Glass]
'He's very still.'

17:15.164 --> 17:17.079
He's dead?

17:17.166 --> 17:19.429
No.

17:19.516 --> 17:21.344
He's alive.

17:21.431 --> 17:23.825
Sleeping.

17:23.912 --> 17:25.696
[shouting]
Conner, wake up!

17:25.783 --> 17:27.872
Can you hear me?
Your mother's here!

17:31.876 --> 17:35.010
He's saying,
"I love you, mo mo."

17:35.097 --> 17:38.231
Mo mo. That's what he called me.
He calls me mo mo.

17:38.318 --> 17:41.147
Oh! Oh!

17:41.234 --> 17:43.714
- 'Thank you.'
- Yeah.

17:43.801 --> 17:45.325
[sighs]

17:45.412 --> 17:47.240
- Hallelujah.
- Mmm.

17:47.327 --> 17:48.632
Amen.

17:54.377 --> 17:56.379
Jonathan! Jonathan!

17:56.466 --> 17:59.121
Jonathan, he's alive.
Conner's alive. Nate sensed him.

17:59.208 --> 18:02.342
Oh, Nate sensed
something alright...money.

18:02.429 --> 18:04.387
- You think Glass was faking?
- 'Course he was.

18:04.474 --> 18:06.650
- Money-grubbin' bastard.
- No, no, no.

18:06.737 --> 18:08.696
It was Conner.
He-he called me mo mo.

18:08.783 --> 18:11.960
That-that's his nickname
for me. N-nobody knew that.

18:12.047 --> 18:15.137
That's exactly how
the trick works, Beth.

18:15.224 --> 18:18.358
You use a detail that
no one could possibly know

18:18.445 --> 18:21.274
except Nate Glass did know.

18:21.361 --> 18:24.059
He's been in and out
of this house for two years.

18:24.146 --> 18:26.496
No, I don't think
he knew that name. No..

18:26.583 --> 18:29.020
How much have you paid him
since your husband died?

18:29.108 --> 18:32.328
How much more will you give him
since he can sense your son?

18:32.415 --> 18:34.156
And then, if Conner dies

18:34.243 --> 18:36.376
and Glass can contact his spirit

18:36.463 --> 18:37.725
what won't you give?

18:37.812 --> 18:39.857
Hey, don't say that.
Don't you dare.

18:39.944 --> 18:42.556
You're sick.
Nate would never do that.

18:42.643 --> 18:44.558
Of course, he would. Believe me.

18:44.645 --> 18:45.602
[chuckles]
He would.

18:45.689 --> 18:47.038
No, you don't know, Patrick.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.649
Apparently, you
don't know anything.

18:48.736 --> 18:50.259
My son called out for me.

18:50.346 --> 18:52.087
He's alive,
but you won't believe it

18:52.174 --> 18:54.002
because you can't
stand what you are

18:54.089 --> 18:55.656
so you run away
from yourself

18:55.743 --> 18:58.485
and you hate anybody like you,
and hurt anybody who cares.

18:58.572 --> 19:00.051
That doesn't mean
I'm psychic.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.923
It just means you're
gullible and desperate.

19:02.010 --> 19:04.839
What is wrong with you
that you treat people like that?

19:04.926 --> 19:07.320
Oh, you should've
seen me ten years ago.

19:12.803 --> 19:13.978
[birds chirping]

19:18.157 --> 19:20.724
It's beautiful, huh?

19:20.811 --> 19:22.900
It's all state
forests that way.

19:22.987 --> 19:26.687
Nothing but bears
and deer...elk.

19:26.774 --> 19:29.298
Hmm.

19:29.385 --> 19:32.910
You're pretty good.
I'll give you that.

19:32.997 --> 19:36.175
Not great.
Just...pretty good.

19:36.262 --> 19:38.133
What can I say?
It's a gift.

19:38.220 --> 19:39.961
Yeah.

19:40.048 --> 19:41.136
Here's the thing, Glass.

19:41.223 --> 19:42.920
I played the same game myself

19:43.007 --> 19:46.010
so normally, I wouldn't tell you
not to run your little scam.

19:46.097 --> 19:47.838
- It's not a scam.
- 'It's a scam.'

19:47.925 --> 19:50.928
We both know it's a scam,
but you stepped over a line.

19:51.015 --> 19:53.714
This is police business. There's
a child's life at stake here.

19:53.801 --> 19:55.672
Yeah, that's why I'm here.

19:55.759 --> 19:58.719
You don't want to push me.

19:58.806 --> 20:00.938
Back off this woman.

20:01.025 --> 20:05.769
Get out of here right now
or you're gonna regret it.

20:05.856 --> 20:08.903
I can understand
your frustration.

20:08.990 --> 20:11.688
You had the vision
and you lost it, and I..

20:11.775 --> 20:13.864
...I can't think
of anything more horrible.

20:13.951 --> 20:16.650
You got a lot of nerve.

20:16.737 --> 20:19.087
Maybe I've got you
pegged all wrong.

20:19.174 --> 20:21.481
Maybe you're
a kidnapper too.

20:21.568 --> 20:24.745
Yeah. No, he's not the balloon
man. I talked to Van Pelt.

20:24.832 --> 20:27.791
During the first two abductions,
he was in New York and Atlanta

20:27.878 --> 20:29.880
giving a presentation
before a 100 people.

20:29.967 --> 20:31.621
Actually, it was 200.

20:31.708 --> 20:33.232
Yeah.

20:33.319 --> 20:34.450
Excuse me.

20:37.279 --> 20:40.543
We don't have time for you
to have a feud with this guy.

20:40.630 --> 20:42.980
I-it's like your conscience
is battling your old self.

20:43.067 --> 20:45.548
There's no upside.

20:45.635 --> 20:47.115
You think
that's why I'm here?

20:47.202 --> 20:48.943
- That's intriguing.
- 'We have to go.'

20:49.030 --> 20:51.467
A boy's life's on
the line and this man could

20:51.554 --> 20:52.990
take another kid and kill him.

20:53.077 --> 20:54.644
Yeah. Let's go then.

20:56.385 --> 20:58.387
So I've been trolling
pedophile chat rooms.

20:58.474 --> 21:01.390
There's this one guy, Charlie95.
Something's up with him.

21:01.477 --> 21:03.914
He's too eager to chat
about the first two boys.

21:04.001 --> 21:05.176
- Are you tracking him?
- Yep.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.178
IT says any minute now.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.702
Tell me you've
got something better.

21:08.789 --> 21:10.312
Been looking
into this black SUV

21:10.399 --> 21:12.488
the power company guy saw,
cross-checking to see

21:12.575 --> 21:15.665
if any registered
pedophiles own one.

21:15.752 --> 21:17.014
- 'It's thin.'
- Yeah, it's thin.

21:17.101 --> 21:18.799
We're not gonna make it, are we?

21:18.886 --> 21:21.497
Jane, feel free
to jump in any time.

21:21.584 --> 21:23.586
I'm thinking.

21:23.673 --> 21:25.240
[inhales deeply]

21:25.327 --> 21:27.764
The second boy, Reggie,
it's bothering me.

21:27.851 --> 21:30.811
If he reached the bus stop
just three minutes later

21:30.898 --> 21:33.509
he would've arrived at
the same time as his classmate

21:33.596 --> 21:35.729
and Reggie would
still be alive today.

21:35.816 --> 21:37.600
- 'Is that bad luck?'
- Or planning.

21:37.687 --> 21:39.863
Maybe the killer was watching
for the perfect moment.

21:39.950 --> 21:41.909
How could anyone have
watched the first kid?

21:41.996 --> 21:44.215
His bus stop's not
visible from the main road.

21:44.303 --> 21:47.131
I've got a picture of the first
crime scene somewhere here.

21:47.218 --> 21:49.569
Charlie95 is Brady Walton

21:49.656 --> 21:51.179
'the power company guy
we questioned.'

21:51.266 --> 21:54.008
- 'It can't be a coincidence.'
- 'It isn't.'

21:54.095 --> 21:56.793
'The killer was watching
from above.'

21:58.839 --> 22:00.406
Walton is the Balloon Man.

22:00.493 --> 22:02.799
Oh, my God.
He was here. We had him.

22:02.886 --> 22:05.846
Get Cho on the phone. Tell him
we're moving in immediately.

22:15.682 --> 22:17.379
Walton's registered four guns
including an AK.

22:17.466 --> 22:19.207
No telling how many
he's really got.

22:19.294 --> 22:21.252
Good to know.
Here's how it's gonna work.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.777
Van Pelt and I are gonna take
the three-four corner.

22:23.864 --> 22:25.822
You and Cho are gonna take
the one-two.

22:25.909 --> 22:28.347
Now be careful.
The kid could still be in there.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.146
[machine gun firing]

22:53.981 --> 22:55.330
You ain't gettin' me!

22:55.417 --> 22:57.463
Not gonna happen!

22:57.550 --> 22:59.508
[Van Pelt]
'Cho, do you copy?'

23:06.341 --> 23:08.387
[panting]
Lisbon, we're pinned.

23:08.474 --> 23:10.476
We're pinned
on the two side.

23:10.563 --> 23:13.435
Take the three corner. Let me
know when you're in position.

23:13.522 --> 23:14.871
[firing continues]

23:17.657 --> 23:19.920
[firing continues]

23:20.007 --> 23:21.791
[panting]

23:23.489 --> 23:25.882
Rigs, I got a clear path
to the front door.

23:25.969 --> 23:26.927
Stand by.

23:27.014 --> 23:28.407
[cocks gun]

23:28.494 --> 23:29.408
[casings clatter]

23:31.845 --> 23:35.283
[Walton]
'It may be too late for me,
but I ain't going to prison!'

23:35.370 --> 23:37.285
'I ain't going quiet!'

23:40.070 --> 23:42.682
Approaching the door.
Stand by.

23:42.769 --> 23:46.033
[panting]
Van Pelt,
are you in position?

23:46.120 --> 23:47.077
Van Pelt?

23:49.558 --> 23:50.864
Van Pelt?

23:54.258 --> 23:55.564
Van Pelt?

23:57.914 --> 23:59.089
Screw you..

23:59.176 --> 24:01.048
[gunshot]
Oh!

24:08.751 --> 24:10.100
[coughs]

24:11.841 --> 24:13.277
Everybody okay?

24:13.364 --> 24:14.975
Find the kid.

24:16.672 --> 24:17.891
Conner?

24:17.978 --> 24:19.283
- Lisbon!
- 'Conner?'

24:19.370 --> 24:21.677
[panting]
I'm alright. Walton's down.

24:21.764 --> 24:23.505
[coughs]

24:23.592 --> 24:25.376
Walton, stay with us.

24:25.464 --> 24:26.421
[coughs]

24:26.508 --> 24:29.511
Where's the kid? Tell us.

24:29.598 --> 24:31.513
Where's Conner?

24:31.600 --> 24:32.993
[strained]
How would I know?

24:33.080 --> 24:35.691
He's lying. Gotta be.

24:35.778 --> 24:38.477
Boss, the house is clear.
The kid's not in there.

24:38.564 --> 24:40.783
[cell phone rings]

24:43.873 --> 24:45.962
Hey, Jane.

24:46.049 --> 24:48.835
We got Walton.
The kid's nowhere to be seen.

24:48.922 --> 24:52.142
Tell Rigsby to look in his left
pocket. There should be a note.

24:55.494 --> 24:58.192
Rigs, is there a note
in your left pants pocket?

25:03.197 --> 25:05.939
"The Balloon Man
didn't take Conner."

25:06.026 --> 25:07.897
Okay, so how'd he do that?

25:14.164 --> 25:17.428
Hey. So videotape puts Brady
Walton at a 7-Eleven across town

25:17.516 --> 25:18.952
while Conner
was being snatched.

25:19.039 --> 25:20.867
- Damn it.
- Yeah.

25:20.954 --> 25:23.130
Walton killed those two boys,
but didn't take Conner.

25:23.217 --> 25:25.219
- We've got a copycat.
- So Jane was right.

25:25.306 --> 25:27.351
[sighs]
Jane was right.

25:27.438 --> 25:29.658
I gotta find Lisbon.
She's not in her office.

25:29.745 --> 25:31.834
Hey, Grace,
well done anyway.

25:31.921 --> 25:34.402
You took down
a seriously bad guy.

25:34.489 --> 25:36.273
Another day,
another dollar.

25:36.360 --> 25:37.753
Hey.

25:37.840 --> 25:39.276
You okay?

25:39.363 --> 25:42.279
Yeah. I feel
pretty good actually.

25:42.366 --> 25:45.065
I'm starting to enjoy
shooting people.

25:47.328 --> 25:49.678
[chuckles]
Gotcha.

25:49.765 --> 25:52.028
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

25:52.115 --> 25:53.508
You didn't get me.

25:53.595 --> 25:54.944
Yeah, I did.

26:01.385 --> 26:03.605
Walton has an alibi
for Conner's abduction.

26:03.692 --> 26:05.215
- 'Hmm.'
- How did you know?

26:05.302 --> 26:08.088
Well, something was just,
uh, a little off.

26:08.175 --> 26:10.873
The other kids Walton killed
were older. They had dark hair.

26:10.960 --> 26:13.833
- That's it?
- Just a good guess.

26:13.920 --> 26:15.661
Why the hell
didn't you tell me?

26:15.748 --> 26:17.184
Would you have done
anything differently?

26:17.271 --> 26:19.229
Probably not. Walton was bad.

26:19.316 --> 26:20.927
[slurps]

26:21.014 --> 26:23.016
Then there's no need
to be cranky.

26:23.103 --> 26:25.409
So who took Conner?

26:25.496 --> 26:27.194
Don't know.
I'm still working on that.

26:27.281 --> 26:30.110
- Is he alive?
- I hope so.

26:30.197 --> 26:32.547
So we're back to square one
on this one.

26:32.634 --> 26:34.288
First principle, motive.

26:34.375 --> 26:37.030
Why would somebody vanish
a nine-year-old boy?

26:37.117 --> 26:39.119
To hide evidence
he was beaten, maybe?

26:39.206 --> 26:41.164
Abuse? Meh. No.

26:41.251 --> 26:46.039
This has the whiff of something
more tangled, more interesting.

26:46.126 --> 26:48.868
Money? We dismissed it because
there was no ransom demand

26:48.955 --> 26:50.957
but there's other ways
to get money.

26:51.044 --> 26:53.437
Conner inherited half
your husband's estate.

26:53.524 --> 26:56.353
Isn't that right, Mrs. Flint?
Twenty million dollars?

26:56.440 --> 26:59.966
Uh, uh, yes. It's being held
in a trust until he turns 30.

27:00.053 --> 27:03.273
- Why?
- Who inherits if Conner dies?

27:03.360 --> 27:05.058
He's.. No, he's just
a little boy.

27:05.145 --> 27:07.887
He's not supposed to
die at all. Wh..

27:07.974 --> 27:09.889
According to the terms
of the trust

27:09.976 --> 27:11.630
you get everything.

27:11.717 --> 27:14.023
Are you saying I..
that I killed my son?

27:14.110 --> 27:16.025
The thing is, we looked
into everybody

27:16.112 --> 27:18.549
in the family's financials.

27:18.637 --> 27:21.509
Jonathan's worth $30 million

27:21.596 --> 27:23.554
but you need money,
don't you, Mrs. Flint?

27:23.642 --> 27:25.600
I-I don't..
I don't know what you mean.

27:25.687 --> 27:28.037
I-I don't know what
I'm doing in this room.

27:28.124 --> 27:30.736
According to the bank
you have $100,000

27:30.823 --> 27:33.260
in credit card debt.

27:33.347 --> 27:37.481
You've spent everything your
husband left you, and then some.

27:37.568 --> 27:40.180
I've made some..
some bad investments

27:40.267 --> 27:42.225
and I-I'm just
not very good with numbers.

27:42.312 --> 27:44.663
I always relied
on James for that.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.360
Could you please sit down?

27:52.061 --> 27:53.410
Thank you.

27:55.369 --> 27:57.327
That must have been
really stressful for you

27:57.414 --> 27:58.633
your financial situation.

27:58.720 --> 28:01.114
It's very embarrassing.

28:01.201 --> 28:03.290
I mean, I couldn't
even tell Deke.

28:03.377 --> 28:06.032
[knock on door]

28:06.119 --> 28:08.121
Uh, could you excuse me?

28:11.864 --> 28:13.517
Her family's here
with a lawyer.

28:13.604 --> 28:16.303
We gotta charge her
or kick her.

28:21.221 --> 28:23.136
Maybe you snapped.

28:23.223 --> 28:25.225
It's understandable.

28:25.312 --> 28:27.793
One weak moment,
and you saw a way out.

28:27.880 --> 28:29.577
If something were
to happen to Conner

28:29.664 --> 28:32.406
all your problems
would be over.

28:32.493 --> 28:36.671
If something happens to Conner,
my lifewill beover.

28:36.758 --> 28:39.718
Please, please..
Just help me find my boy.

28:42.982 --> 28:43.896
[sighs]

28:47.160 --> 28:49.336
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. I'm fine. Hi.

28:49.423 --> 28:50.424
[kisses]

28:50.511 --> 28:52.165
What did they want?

28:52.252 --> 28:56.082
Well, they a-asked me a lot
of questions about money.

28:56.169 --> 28:57.997
[Lisbon]
'Mom's clean.
What are you thinking?'

28:58.084 --> 29:00.434
[Jane]
'What was I thinking?'

29:00.521 --> 29:03.132
I was thinking, uh...

29:03.219 --> 29:05.352
Love is strange..

29:05.439 --> 29:08.050
...and I was thinking
about a sandwich.

29:09.791 --> 29:13.012
You know who else is profiting
from Conner's abduction?

29:13.099 --> 29:14.665
- Who?
- Nathan Glass.

29:14.753 --> 29:17.103
He alibied out
for the first two kids

29:17.190 --> 29:19.192
but not Conner,
and maybe he took him

29:19.279 --> 29:21.281
to cement his relationship
with Beth.

29:21.368 --> 29:23.109
Well, he's certainly
heartless enough.

29:23.196 --> 29:26.025
- We'll get him in a room.
- No, he'll just clam up.

29:26.112 --> 29:28.505
What if we get him
to lead us to Conner?

29:28.592 --> 29:30.116
That would be nice.

29:30.203 --> 29:31.944
Boss, forensics came back
with the labs

29:32.031 --> 29:33.859
on Conner's school bus stop.

29:33.946 --> 29:34.903
Nothing?

29:34.990 --> 29:36.600
Nope. The only weird thing is

29:36.687 --> 29:38.515
there were traces
of white fir pollen

29:38.602 --> 29:40.039
'where they think
Conner was grabbed.'

29:40.126 --> 29:41.780
No white firs there.
Just pines.

29:41.867 --> 29:44.260
- Alright. Thanks.
- Okay.

29:46.436 --> 29:49.048
Yes. Got it.

29:50.658 --> 29:51.615
[clatters]

29:54.488 --> 29:56.707
Thank you, Caroline.

29:56.795 --> 29:59.188
[sighs]
Let's get out of here.

29:59.275 --> 30:00.886
Any news?

30:00.973 --> 30:02.975
No, uh, listen,
I just wanted to say

30:03.062 --> 30:05.325
I'm sorry for everything
that's happened.

30:05.412 --> 30:08.328
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

30:08.415 --> 30:12.245
- Uh, bye.
- Wait. Wait. No, Patrick.

30:12.332 --> 30:14.508
- When you grabbed my hand--
- Nothing happened at all.

30:14.595 --> 30:15.814
- Something happened. Are you--
- No!

30:15.901 --> 30:17.728
No, no. Are you
sensing something?

30:17.816 --> 30:19.774
- No. No.
- Liar. Liar.

30:23.082 --> 30:25.736
I see..

30:25.824 --> 30:27.608
There's a face.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.220
What's wrong?

30:31.307 --> 30:32.308
It's Conner.

30:32.395 --> 30:34.006
- It is?
- Oh, my God.

30:34.093 --> 30:35.311
Jane, what are you doing?

30:35.398 --> 30:37.139
I don't understand.

30:37.226 --> 30:39.141
He's standing right there
in front of me.

30:39.228 --> 30:43.450
[panting]
Lisbon.

30:43.537 --> 30:45.974
- What is it?
- Lisbon, I don't like this.

30:46.061 --> 30:48.455
- I don't like this.
- What's going on?

30:48.542 --> 30:51.110
'No. There's someone there.
I see someone.'

30:51.197 --> 30:54.461
Oh, wait. Wait.
There's someone.

30:54.548 --> 30:56.724
Are.. they're following.

30:56.811 --> 30:58.508
They're gonna catch me.

30:58.595 --> 31:00.075
Sweating.

31:00.162 --> 31:02.338
- His abductor?
- Oh, come on. This is crap.

31:02.425 --> 31:03.426
Shh.

31:03.513 --> 31:04.863
[breathing heavily]

31:07.953 --> 31:09.345
I can't do it.

31:09.432 --> 31:11.608
I can't do it.
He's just a little boy.

31:11.695 --> 31:13.610
I-I..

31:13.697 --> 31:16.613
Conner. Conner.

31:16.700 --> 31:18.920
Yes, yes. Conner. Conner.
Where is Conner?

31:19.007 --> 31:22.750
There's a.. There's a light,
and it dances.

31:22.837 --> 31:25.231
It just dance..
It dances on the water.

31:25.318 --> 31:27.059
- It's dancing on the water.
- Oh, god.

31:27.146 --> 31:29.148
- It's so beautiful.
- Conner. Conner's near water.

31:29.235 --> 31:32.455
It's a strong smell, like..

31:32.542 --> 31:34.544
...spicy, like Christmas--

31:34.631 --> 31:35.763
Pine trees?

31:35.850 --> 31:38.505
It's like pine trees,
but different.

31:38.592 --> 31:43.075
Oh, and the bad.. There's
a bad smell, a bad taste.

31:43.162 --> 31:44.772
Pungent.

31:44.859 --> 31:47.079
Gunpowder.
Yeah, it's gunpowder.

31:47.166 --> 31:49.081
It's bad.

31:49.168 --> 31:50.691
[gasps]

31:50.778 --> 31:52.301
[exhales deeply]

31:52.388 --> 31:55.348
And you can almost see
the house.

31:55.435 --> 31:58.133
He's just surrounded.
There's wood, wood and trees.

31:58.220 --> 32:00.614
And-and..

32:00.701 --> 32:03.486
[sighs]

32:03.573 --> 32:07.490
Uh, he's in a cabin.
It's not a cabin.

32:07.577 --> 32:10.841
No, it's like a, uh,
it's smaller, like a sh..

32:10.929 --> 32:12.452
Oh! I'm tired.

32:12.539 --> 32:15.455
Jane. Wake up.

32:15.542 --> 32:18.240
'Jane, wake up!'

32:18.327 --> 32:20.025
- 'What happened?'
- 'I don't know.'

32:20.112 --> 32:22.418
I was gonna ask you that.
That was weird.

32:22.505 --> 32:25.421
- I knew you could sense him.
- Please don't touch me.

32:25.508 --> 32:27.989
Get all of your neighbors
and volunteers.

32:28.076 --> 32:30.296
'Karl, I want you to call
the sheriff's department.'

32:30.383 --> 32:32.298
Cho'll lead the search
of the state forest.

32:32.385 --> 32:34.082
We'll start
at the Flint property line.

32:34.169 --> 32:36.563
One hour. Come on.

32:38.478 --> 32:40.219
[pants and sighs]

32:43.352 --> 32:45.267
See, that's how you do
a psychic reading?

32:45.354 --> 32:47.139
[clicks tongue]

32:47.226 --> 32:48.270
[blinds rattle]

32:48.357 --> 32:51.056
Whew.

32:51.143 --> 32:53.536
[yawns]

32:56.844 --> 32:59.499
[birds chirping]

33:25.220 --> 33:27.309
Drop the knife!
Do it now!

33:27.396 --> 33:29.964
Are you deaf?
Drop it, Flint!

33:30.051 --> 33:32.140
I wasn't gonna hurt him,
I swear.

33:32.227 --> 33:34.621
Get on your knees.
Put your hands on your head.

33:41.758 --> 33:42.716
[opens latch]

33:42.803 --> 33:43.760
[clicks]

33:52.030 --> 33:55.337
Conner, I'm agent Van Pelt.
I'm from the CBI.

33:55.424 --> 33:56.773
I'm here to help you.

33:56.860 --> 33:57.861
Are you okay?

33:57.948 --> 33:58.906
Yeah.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.257
Ohh.

34:02.344 --> 34:04.129
[Jonathan]
'I was just looking for Conner.'

34:04.216 --> 34:07.088
This is all
a big misunderstanding.

34:07.175 --> 34:09.003
You wanted Conner dead.

34:09.090 --> 34:12.702
You grabbed him, made it look
like a child murderer did it.

34:12.789 --> 34:14.443
Which part are
we misunderstanding?

34:14.530 --> 34:15.923
But you couldn't
bring yourself

34:16.010 --> 34:18.404
to kill your baby brother
face-to-face

34:18.491 --> 34:20.797
so you left him
in that duck blind.

34:20.884 --> 34:22.538
No food, no water,
no chance.

34:22.625 --> 34:24.323
No, that's not true.

34:24.410 --> 34:27.108
Why would I want Conner dead?
I don't need his money.

34:27.195 --> 34:29.110
Love.

34:29.197 --> 34:32.157
You are in love with Beth.

34:32.244 --> 34:36.683
- What are you thinking?
- Uh, I was thinking..

34:36.770 --> 34:38.119
Love is strange.

34:40.426 --> 34:42.558
Jane called this one right.

34:42.645 --> 34:45.866
He was in love with Beth, only
she didn't see him that way.

34:45.953 --> 34:48.173
- How was he gonna change that?
- Kill her kid.

34:48.260 --> 34:50.436
Be there to comfort her,
pick the broken pieces.

34:50.523 --> 34:52.786
- No! I always planned--
- 'Always planned what?'

34:52.873 --> 34:54.788
What did you plan?

34:54.875 --> 34:56.659
[sighs]

34:59.836 --> 35:02.187
[sighs]

35:02.274 --> 35:05.581
I had always planned to go get
him and bring him back.

35:05.668 --> 35:07.322
Play the hero.

35:09.455 --> 35:12.153
Put on a mask,
kidnap Conner

35:12.240 --> 35:14.634
then go find him later,
rescue him.

35:14.721 --> 35:17.158
And then Beth is filled
with gratitude

35:17.245 --> 35:20.030
and falls
into your manly arms.

35:20.118 --> 35:21.815
- Bingo.
- That's a dumb plan.

35:21.902 --> 35:24.600
I was going
to bring him back!

35:26.820 --> 35:29.605
So what was the knife for?

35:29.692 --> 35:31.651
I..

35:31.738 --> 35:33.131
I didn't..

35:37.396 --> 35:41.139
Planning is easy.
Reality's a bit harder.

35:41.226 --> 35:45.012
What if Conner recognized you?
What if Jane is psychic?

35:45.099 --> 35:49.016
Better just to make a clean
break and kill the kid, right?

35:49.103 --> 35:51.584
He is.

35:51.671 --> 35:55.109
Jane's psychic.
Isn't he?

35:55.196 --> 35:56.545
Nah.

35:56.632 --> 36:00.419
We followed you.
You led us to Conner.

36:00.506 --> 36:01.724
No.

36:01.811 --> 36:03.291
No, no, no.
That's impossible.

36:03.378 --> 36:05.554
The stuff Mr. Jane said,
that he saw Conner.

36:05.641 --> 36:08.296
The-the trees,
the smell of gunpowder

36:08.383 --> 36:11.647
near a-a body of water..
It was all accurate.

36:11.734 --> 36:14.128
How the hell did he do it?

36:22.832 --> 36:25.226
- Mom. Mommy!
- Hi.

36:25.313 --> 36:27.750
[crying]
Hi, baby.

36:27.837 --> 36:29.622
Oh, baby, you're home.

36:29.709 --> 36:31.058
You're home. You're safe.

36:31.145 --> 36:33.495
Yeah, welcome home, buddy.

36:33.582 --> 36:35.845
'Ohh. Mm.'

36:35.932 --> 36:38.935
Look at you. Oh, my God.

36:39.022 --> 36:40.763
Oh. I'm just happy, okay?

36:40.850 --> 36:43.549
You want some French toast?
I made you some French toast.

36:43.636 --> 36:46.682
- French toast is for breakfast.
- It's a special occasion.

36:46.769 --> 36:48.510
Come on.

36:48.597 --> 36:49.946
[sniffles]
Come on.

36:52.166 --> 36:53.559
Congratulations, Mr. Jane.

36:53.646 --> 36:56.518
Oh. Yes, yes.

36:56.605 --> 36:59.826
You son of a bitch.
You trying to steal my action?

36:59.913 --> 37:02.959
Mr. Glass,
nice to finally meet you.

37:03.046 --> 37:06.049
And you got no action. You're
a disgrace to the profession.

37:06.136 --> 37:08.574
That contact
you faked with Conner..

37:08.661 --> 37:10.880
Weak. Weak.

37:10.967 --> 37:12.969
Bite me.
That gag was seamless.

37:13.056 --> 37:15.494
You see how she fell for it?

37:15.581 --> 37:18.323
[high-pitched]
"Oh. Mo mo. Mo mo."

37:18.410 --> 37:19.585
[laughs]

37:20.412 --> 37:21.848
[chuckles]

37:21.935 --> 37:23.806
Thanks. That should do it.

37:23.893 --> 37:25.504
Excuse me?

37:25.591 --> 37:28.507
[clears throat]
And, uh, stop.

37:28.594 --> 37:29.986
[beeps]

37:30.073 --> 37:32.598
[Glass on tape]
"Oh. Mo mo. Mo mo."

37:32.685 --> 37:35.557
[laughs]

37:35.644 --> 37:36.558
Bye.

37:46.916 --> 37:48.222
Don't leave.

37:48.309 --> 37:50.529
I won't.
We'll be right over there.

37:50.616 --> 37:51.965
[sheets rustle]

37:55.490 --> 37:58.014
So..

37:58.101 --> 38:00.452
You gonna tell me
how you did it?

38:00.539 --> 38:03.193
Everything you said came true..

38:03.281 --> 38:06.588
...but it was a trick,
wasn't it?

38:06.675 --> 38:07.589
Yeah.

38:09.635 --> 38:10.592
How?

38:13.595 --> 38:15.467
Well, um..

38:17.251 --> 38:20.602
Being held not far from home..

38:20.689 --> 38:22.169
...the police shut down
the roads

38:22.256 --> 38:23.736
immediately
after Conner's abduction.

38:23.823 --> 38:25.781
The lake..

38:25.868 --> 38:28.784
There's always a body
of water nearby, always.

38:28.871 --> 38:31.265
Trees, leaves, earth..

38:31.352 --> 38:33.441
There was, uh,
white fir pollen

38:33.528 --> 38:36.792
found at, uh,
at the bus stop

38:36.879 --> 38:39.621
and where could you hide
anyone in a forest?

38:39.708 --> 38:43.103
Hunting blind,
hence the gunpowder smell.

38:43.190 --> 38:46.411
And I was watching
Jonathan's face the whole time.

38:46.498 --> 38:50.676
I could see whenever
my guesses landed.

38:51.807 --> 38:54.506
[sighs]
Of course.

38:56.029 --> 38:57.813
Elegant.

39:03.210 --> 39:05.908
You know,
all those years ago

39:05.995 --> 39:07.170
when you were a psychic

39:07.257 --> 39:10.913
and...you were lying to me

39:11.000 --> 39:12.524
telling me about my future--

39:12.611 --> 39:14.700
Yeah, I'm-I'm very sorry
about that.

39:14.787 --> 39:16.789
Don't apologize.

39:16.876 --> 39:20.053
You tried to tell me.

39:20.140 --> 39:22.838
You deceived me, sure..

39:22.925 --> 39:25.101
[sighs]

39:25.188 --> 39:27.190
...but you gave me hope.

39:31.847 --> 39:33.719
Thank you for that.

39:39.507 --> 39:40.856
Goodbye, Patrick.

39:42.118 --> 39:43.468
Bye, Beth.

40:04.837 --> 40:06.447
[sighs]

40:06.534 --> 40:09.276
- Cheer up.
- Oh, I'm cheery.

40:09.363 --> 40:11.321
You heard her.
You gave her hope.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.323
I didn't give her hope.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.848
I sold her hope.

40:15.935 --> 40:18.198
I think hope is worth it
at any price.

40:18.285 --> 40:19.982
What, are you running
for office now?

40:20.069 --> 40:21.593
Okay, you know what?

40:21.680 --> 40:24.117
You're a wicked charlatan,
and you're going to hell then.

40:24.204 --> 40:27.163
That's more like it. I'll save
you a seat by the fire.

40:27.250 --> 40:28.904
Oh, I'm not going to hell.

40:28.991 --> 40:30.384
- Oh, you're not?
- 'No.'

40:30.471 --> 40:31.994
You've made
other arrangements, huh?

40:32.081 --> 40:35.128
- 'Mm-hmm.'
- 'Yeah, where are you going?'

40:35.215 --> 40:37.130
[Lisbon]
'Do you really wanna have
this conversation?'

40:37.217 --> 40:40.263
'You ready for some,
uh, theological talk here?'

40:40.350 --> 40:42.309
[Jane]
'I don't reallywanna
have that conversation.'

40:42.396 --> 40:44.398
[Lisbon]
'You wanted to feel better,
not worse.'

40:44.485 --> 40:46.661
[Jane]
'I'm gonna recline
and have a little sleep.'

40:46.748 --> 40:48.097
[Lisbon]
'Okay.'
