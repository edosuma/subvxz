WEBVTT

00:01.168 --> 00:02.670
<i>Previously on Hit The Floor...</i>

00:02.836 --> 00:04.884
I failed,
tested positive for oxymetholone.

00:05.047 --> 00:07.141
I didn't take it.
You believe me, don't you?

00:07.299 --> 00:11.099
I could drop all this Pete nonsense
if you have sex with me one last time.

00:11.220 --> 00:12.597
I'm pulling you off choreography.

00:12.763 --> 00:14.106
- You can't pull me.
- Oh, I just did.

00:14.223 --> 00:16.601
- There's a call from Folsom State Prison.
- I'll take it.

00:16.767 --> 00:18.895
Wow. Quite a showstopper.

00:19.061 --> 00:21.063
When I'm back that's the first thing
I'm going to cut.

00:21.230 --> 00:24.154
This is me putting my name in
for the All-Star game.

00:24.316 --> 00:26.159
I don't want to be
someone else's love interest.

00:26.318 --> 00:28.696
- So you're not doing the video? Me, too.
- I'm scared.

00:28.820 --> 00:32.040
What you're sitting on could put
Oscar in prison for a long time.

00:32.198 --> 00:34.668
- I don't have proof.
- I can help you.

00:37.579 --> 00:39.001
Mia?

00:39.748 --> 00:41.796
- Stay away from me.
- If I'm a mistake,

00:41.959 --> 00:45.680
I'll be the best mistake you ever make.
If I'm not, I will change your life.

01:01.019 --> 01:03.442
With the All Star Game
just around the corner,

01:03.605 --> 01:06.074
it's not only ballers
who represent their teams.

01:06.233 --> 01:08.281
One dancer from each city
is chosen by the fans

01:08.443 --> 01:11.788
and this year LA has two
gorgeous ladies to choose from,

01:11.947 --> 01:14.325
Devil Girls Ahsha Hayes
and Jelena Howard.

01:14.491 --> 01:18.121
So, girls, what does being
an All-Star mean to you?

01:18.287 --> 01:20.710
A dream come true,
best of the best.

01:20.872 --> 01:23.751
It's an honour representing
the Devil Girls.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.136
You can't take it for granted no matter
how many times you do it.

01:26.295 --> 01:29.720
Girls, come in close.
Just between us I need to know,

01:29.881 --> 01:31.849
are you clawing your way
to the finish line?

01:32.009 --> 01:36.139
No, no, not at all.
Ahsha and I are like sisters.

01:36.263 --> 01:41.110
I just can't think of one word to describe
this one that would do herjustice.

01:41.268 --> 01:43.646
Yo, sweetie, you've got a...

01:43.812 --> 01:46.816
Shame we can't send them both.
You can vote online now,

01:46.940 --> 01:50.410
but first, how would you like
to see this girls in action?

01:52.070 --> 01:55.074
It's a joke if you think
you're going to win.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.868
Enjoy your five minutes.

01:58.035 --> 02:02.381
Jelena, great to see you again.

04:11.877 --> 04:15.051
Oscar, why the hell am I hearing
from other people

04:15.213 --> 04:18.341
that Terrence Wall is a signature away
from signing with Indiana?

04:18.507 --> 04:20.601
Good morning, Peter.

04:20.761 --> 04:23.310
You pay me to win games, I do that.

04:23.472 --> 04:26.646
And you didn't bother to talk to me
about getting rid of my best player?

04:26.808 --> 04:29.652
Coaches don't always know about
trades. You know that.

04:29.811 --> 04:32.690
It's for your protection,
to preserve your relationship

04:32.856 --> 04:36.611
with the players on your roster, which,
for your information includes Terrence.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.030
- Yeah, for now.
- Oh, for a good while.

04:39.196 --> 04:41.745
He made himself a great deal
in Indiana,

04:41.907 --> 04:44.376
but he also blew it
by failing his drug test.

04:44.534 --> 04:47.834
Yeah. He tested positive
for oxymetholone.

04:47.996 --> 04:52.843
You're the first to hear,
but Terrence will remain a Devil.

04:54.669 --> 04:57.843
So, not only, only am I supposed
to coach a player

04:58.006 --> 05:00.976
who doesn't want to play for me
anymore, but he's doping?

05:01.134 --> 05:03.978
Well, you can forget it.
I won't play him!

05:04.137 --> 05:05.935
People come to see Terrence Wall.

05:06.097 --> 05:08.816
That's why I pay him the obscene
amount of money that I do.

05:08.975 --> 05:11.319
Well, then, they can see him
on the bench.

05:11.478 --> 05:14.948
You may control who is on the team,
I control who plays.

05:20.278 --> 05:23.873
I'm trailing Jelena by 100,000 votes.

05:24.032 --> 05:27.662
- That's not terrible.
- Out of 110,000?

05:27.786 --> 05:30.084
Jelena was right. This is a joke.

05:30.247 --> 05:35.629
I'm gonna get all my students to vote
for you, by giving them extra credit.

05:35.794 --> 05:39.389
And I've been voting for you non-stop.

05:43.593 --> 05:46.187
Boom. There's one more.

05:50.976 --> 05:53.775
And it's a sold-out game, so just make
sure they're on their toes. Thanks.

05:56.189 --> 06:00.319
I'm assuming by your urgent phone call
you've come to some sort of decision.

06:02.112 --> 06:05.742
Let's be clear. if I sleep with you
one last time,

06:05.866 --> 06:08.619
you're out of my life forever.

06:08.743 --> 06:10.745
Forever.

06:14.040 --> 06:17.840
<i>- I'll</i> do it.
- Delightful.

06:18.003 --> 06:20.005
I'll swing by your place
tomorrow night.

06:20.171 --> 06:22.890
I am not doing this with Miguel home.

06:23.049 --> 06:26.223
No, I'm just picking you up
to go to a hotel.

06:26.344 --> 06:29.018
It's like you don't think
I have any class.

06:36.438 --> 06:38.987
I know, Marjorie, I know.
There's a game going on.

06:39.149 --> 06:40.901
I should be in the box.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.069
Marjorie's in the ladies room.

06:47.282 --> 06:49.284
Mia.

06:51.661 --> 06:53.709
It's good to see you.

06:53.872 --> 06:57.968
I bet. You've been hunting me
like a dog for months.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.220
You left this office so abruptly
that night,

07:00.378 --> 07:03.803
which is why I'm a little surprised
to see you waltz in here

07:03.965 --> 07:05.763
in the middle of the afternoon.

07:05.926 --> 07:09.351
I'm a lot more confident with this.

07:10.347 --> 07:12.475
All the hotel rooms you sent me to,

07:12.641 --> 07:17.613
all the games you fixed
because of what I did, all right here.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.148
You made me wear this mic

07:19.314 --> 07:22.488
so you would have something
to hold over those guys' heads.

07:22.651 --> 07:24.824
Well, who's looking up at it now?

07:27.030 --> 07:32.127
I did what I did for you,
for this team.

07:32.285 --> 07:36.461
But the minute I came to you for help,
I became a problem.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.089
I was attacked!

07:40.251 --> 07:44.631
But instead of having my back
you ransacked my place looking for this.

07:44.798 --> 07:50.180
Now? Now I really am a problem,
because this, this would ruin your life.

07:52.889 --> 07:55.813
But it would also ruin mine

07:55.976 --> 08:00.072
because with it,
this will never be over.

08:07.195 --> 08:10.369
I'm out. You win.

08:11.700 --> 08:16.752
I'm tired of running,
of looking over my shoulder.

08:18.123 --> 08:22.594
The only way to have you out of my life
is to give what you want and go.

08:26.548 --> 08:28.300
Where will you go?

08:28.466 --> 08:33.472
I can't get my life back here,
but I can have one somewhere else,

08:33.638 --> 08:36.015
one I deserve.

08:36.140 --> 08:38.735
I hope everything goes well
for you there.

08:40.812 --> 08:44.236
I wish that night never happened.

08:54.075 --> 08:55.827
Yeah, way to play it, Terrence!

08:55.994 --> 08:57.416
I've never been benched a game
in my life!

08:57.579 --> 08:59.923
You know how bad this makes me look,
how many questions I'll be asked?

09:00.081 --> 09:02.049
I did not expect this from Coach D!

09:02.208 --> 09:04.427
In Pete's defence,
you did have a positive drug test.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.217
In Pete's defence?

09:06.379 --> 09:09.929
-It's natural to be suspicious.
- You think I did it.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.679
- It doesn't matter what I think.
- That's all that matters.

09:16.848 --> 09:20.227
I don't know what I'd do
if I didn't think you were on my side.

09:22.353 --> 09:24.355
I'm on your side.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.905
I believe you.

09:38.328 --> 09:42.128
Seat 1 D,
I was giving it to you out there.

09:42.290 --> 09:44.292
Were my high kicks high enough?

09:45.293 --> 09:49.093
Yes. What? Yes.
You're totally enough.

09:49.255 --> 09:53.260
You were, like, pow! Wow.

09:54.260 --> 09:55.853
Yeah?

09:57.764 --> 09:59.766
Sorry, I'm not like the guy,

09:59.933 --> 10:03.358
who hangs out outside
a dancer's locker room after a game.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.568
I just thought we had a connection

10:05.730 --> 10:10.577
and I would just kick my ass forever
if I didn't, you know, take a chance.

10:11.569 --> 10:15.949
I suppose my recent cinematic exploits
add a little fuel to your gas tank.

10:17.492 --> 10:21.087
- Your recent...?
- My tape.

10:22.080 --> 10:25.505
- Crashed file-share?
- Wow, that's...

10:25.625 --> 10:28.219
Oh, okay. Well...

10:28.378 --> 10:31.678
- I'm glad you ponied up the courage.
- Now what?

10:31.840 --> 10:33.968
Now you ask me if I want to go out
with you some time.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.683
Do you want to go out
with me some time?

10:36.845 --> 10:40.019
I'd love to. Be specific.
Say tomorrow.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.313
- How about tomorrow?
Perfect.

10:42.475 --> 10:45.649
Now, take out your cell phone
and ask me for my number.

10:48.857 --> 10:50.404
Can I have your phone number?

10:56.447 --> 11:00.042
Piece of cake. You take direction well.

11:01.661 --> 11:05.791
I like that in a man. See you, 1D.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.347
Who's that?

11:13.506 --> 11:16.476
Jake Vaughan, page 11 in my binder.

11:16.634 --> 11:20.104
Age 25, internet billionaire.

11:20.221 --> 11:23.816
He's like the Facebook guy
before the movie made him obnoxious.

11:24.809 --> 11:29.656
The Devils may have had trouble
scoring today, but I didn't.

11:32.150 --> 11:33.777
Losing is a terrible feeling.

11:33.902 --> 11:37.076
-It's just one game.
- I wasn't talking about the game.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.499
You're way behind Jelena
on the All-Star vote.

11:40.658 --> 11:43.912
- Kind of caught that.
- No one outside LA knows who you are.

11:44.078 --> 11:45.830
Kind of caught that, too.

11:45.997 --> 11:49.592
Jelena's Jelena. She's a celebrity.
She goes on talk shows.

11:49.751 --> 11:53.176
She bats
those freakishly perfect green eyes.

11:53.338 --> 11:56.057
You have something Jelena doesn't.

11:57.133 --> 12:01.138
- A first name that's a palindrome?
- You're Pete Davenport's daughter.

12:02.764 --> 12:06.894
If that were to leak out, everyone would
want to see you at that All-Star game.

12:07.936 --> 12:12.487
I'm a dancer, not a story.
I want to win because of my talent.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.611
Talent only gets you so far.

12:17.403 --> 12:20.407
It was true of me,
it was true of Jelena.

12:22.617 --> 12:24.619
There's a whole world out there,

12:24.744 --> 12:27.418
beyond the Devil Girls,
beyond the All-Star Game.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.457
You could reach it.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.507
Trust me when I say,
I don't say that to just any girl.

12:36.297 --> 12:38.846
Thanks, but no thanks.

12:39.008 --> 12:43.138
My private life is my private life.
That's just who I am.

12:53.648 --> 12:57.243
- You look wretched.
- This is my losing face.

12:57.402 --> 13:03.205
It is sour and it is ugly.
Winning streak is over.

13:04.617 --> 13:08.713
Oscar is not happy with me.
That's too bad.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.873
What's the worst he can do?

13:11.040 --> 13:15.511
Well, I mean, how bad can he get?

13:15.670 --> 13:18.298
You're his main guy on court.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.349
Maybe you have an idea.

13:24.345 --> 13:26.313
Sloane, I was not in a good place

13:26.472 --> 13:28.850
when this coaching job came along.
I need it now.

13:29.017 --> 13:33.488
And I need it not to be gunked up
by whatever Oscar's got going on.

13:33.646 --> 13:36.820
That's his business, this is mine.

13:40.695 --> 13:43.039
I have some other business with you.

13:47.660 --> 13:52.666
- Yeah?
- I want to talk about us.

13:55.585 --> 14:00.091
What are we even doing?
I don't know where I stand.

14:01.758 --> 14:04.682
What are you thinking?
What are you feeling?

14:06.346 --> 14:09.395
I know what I want to feel.

14:09.557 --> 14:15.985
Sloane, we've been doing this for the
last few weeks and it has been great.

14:16.105 --> 14:18.699
Been better than great.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.987
But I think we need to define
our relationship.

14:30.745 --> 14:33.874
- Jesse?
- How did you know?

14:34.874 --> 14:37.127
It didn't really require witchcraft,
Raquel.

14:38.961 --> 14:44.058
Yeah, well, I'm doing something to get
him out of my life once and for all.

14:46.094 --> 14:49.223
Jesse said that
if I have sex with him one last time,

14:49.389 --> 14:52.063
he'll stay away from me and Miguel
for good.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.236
I said yes.

14:57.397 --> 15:00.241
Why the hell would you agree to
something like that?

15:00.400 --> 15:04.280
- Where's your dignity?
- I'm doing it for my son.

15:04.445 --> 15:06.038
I'm not like you.

15:06.197 --> 15:11.499
I can't go to battle like you can,
so, you do what you have to do.

15:21.712 --> 15:23.714
Mom?

15:41.399 --> 15:43.367
Mom?

15:45.069 --> 15:47.037
Mom?

15:49.949 --> 15:51.701
Oh, my God.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.955
Ahsha!

15:58.583 --> 16:00.585
Ahsha, wait!

16:00.751 --> 16:03.129
You didn't come to The Grove
or the game.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.924
- Ahsha. Ahsha!
- Pete Davenport?

16:06.090 --> 16:08.218
The guy who wasn't good enough
for me to know existed

16:08.342 --> 16:11.312
is good enough for you
to have sex with?

16:11.471 --> 16:14.896
You don't care about me.
Neither of you do.

16:15.057 --> 16:17.776
All you care about is getting
your rocks off.

16:17.935 --> 16:20.279
He's your drug and you're back
on the pipe all over again.

16:20.438 --> 16:21.940
No!

16:37.580 --> 16:41.050
How was she? How are...?

16:44.837 --> 16:48.432
This fling is over.

16:52.803 --> 16:56.933
All right, man, I'll meet you at
the front. All right.

16:57.099 --> 17:00.899
Jelena, looking beautiful as always.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.990
I know about your arrangement
with Raquel.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.236
I also know
the only thing you love more

17:08.402 --> 17:10.621
than making Raquel squirm is
making money.

17:11.821 --> 17:13.824
I'm listening.

17:13.991 --> 17:15.992
You know who LJ Reynolds is?

17:16.160 --> 17:18.208
Of course.
He's the next Dennis Rodman.

17:18.371 --> 17:21.420
Twice the kink and four times
the earning potential.

17:21.540 --> 17:26.637
Well, LJ's about to sign a deal
with Oklahoma for $135 million.

17:26.796 --> 17:30.426
With no agent attached,
that's a hefty commission.

17:31.801 --> 17:34.600
I know.
I can't get anywhere near him.

17:35.596 --> 17:39.601
I know LJ through Terrence. I also know
he's having a private party tonight.

17:39.767 --> 17:43.567
- No agents to compete with.
- Is that right?

17:45.231 --> 17:48.861
I'm willing to risk that friendship,
give you the address to the party

17:48.985 --> 17:55.118
and some one-on-one time with LJ
if you leave Raquel alone for good.

17:56.784 --> 18:01.631
Which do you care about more, Jesse?
Raquel or cash?

18:04.166 --> 18:06.385
What's the address?

18:07.753 --> 18:10.802
- I have your word you'll back off her?
- Absolutely.

18:17.179 --> 18:19.557
I could get used to doing deals
with you.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.859
So she just walked right in
and gave it to you?

18:30.568 --> 18:32.946
Huh, did she know you were making all
that money gambling on the spread?

18:33.112 --> 18:36.912
I didn't make a dime,
never gambled on one game.

18:37.074 --> 18:40.669
Now, if the investors wanted
to work off a tip

18:40.828 --> 18:44.298
and pour their winnings back
into the new arena development,

18:44.457 --> 18:47.301
well, that's just good business
on their part.

18:48.377 --> 18:50.379
And goodbye to that girl.

18:50.504 --> 18:54.350
Now that she's out of our hair for good,
I feel like celebrating.

18:54.508 --> 19:00.015
For helping motivate her gift,
I have a little gift for you.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.560
Congratulations, Chase.

19:07.855 --> 19:09.232
Is it official?

19:09.398 --> 19:14.245
As of today, you are the new Executive
Vice President of Business Operations

19:14.403 --> 19:16.781
for the LA Devils.

19:25.206 --> 19:27.208
Your first official act.

19:36.884 --> 19:39.228
Obviously you've seen the latest
All-Star numbers.

19:39.387 --> 19:41.230
I don't know
what Olivia promised you,

19:41.389 --> 19:44.609
but if it was humiliation,
she delivered.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.772
You should be careful of Olivia.

19:49.939 --> 19:53.068
She has an agenda just like
everyone else around here.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.241
Chin up, All Star.

20:01.659 --> 20:06.130
That Takahashi telescope is my baby.
I just installed it last week.

20:06.288 --> 20:09.212
Normally, only observatories
or universities have them,

20:09.375 --> 20:11.628
but I figured I work hard enough.

20:11.794 --> 20:15.674
Don't I deserve a little fluorite
apochromatic retracting in my life?

20:18.342 --> 20:24.145
I just love details and it magnifies
objects over 1,000 times

20:24.306 --> 20:26.900
for unparalleled viewing
of celestial bodies.

20:27.059 --> 20:30.188
You don't need a telescope to see
a heavenly body up close.

20:36.569 --> 20:40.164
I'm sorry. I got into telescopes
when I was a kid

20:40.322 --> 20:42.541
because I dreamed
of being somewhere else.

20:42.700 --> 20:47.171
My father was a preacher
and growing up in that household,

20:47.329 --> 20:49.331
well, it kind of sucked.

20:49.498 --> 20:55.631
- Really? My daddy was a preacher too.
- How did you deal with it?

20:56.630 --> 20:58.724
By breaking as many commandments
as possible.

21:00.342 --> 21:04.188
I've never told you how to do your job,
unlike other star players.

21:04.305 --> 21:06.899
I think you're a great coach
and I respect you.

21:07.057 --> 21:08.354
But?

21:08.517 --> 21:11.361
I also respect Terrence and we need
him to win a championship.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.193
I'm not gonna discuss Terrence
with you.

21:13.355 --> 21:16.700
All right, great, me neither.
I want to talk about me.

21:18.152 --> 21:20.371
I crunched the numbers with
the assistant coaches to figure out how

21:20.529 --> 21:23.533
we could cut back on Terrence's playing
time on the court to keep him healthy.

21:23.699 --> 21:25.076
You did?

21:25.242 --> 21:27.495
I need 6.8 more points,
3.2 more rebounds

21:27.620 --> 21:30.544
and 1.7 more assists per game.

21:33.334 --> 21:36.759
I'm not gonna try
and tell you what to do.

21:37.797 --> 21:41.176
I just wanted you to know
what I'm gonna be doing.

21:46.722 --> 21:50.317
<i>And Jelena Howard. So, Girls, what
does being an All-Star mean to you?</i>

21:50.476 --> 21:54.071
<i>It's amazing. Best of the best.
Dream come true.</i>

21:54.230 --> 21:56.358
<i>I've got a question for you. Be honest.</i>

21:56.524 --> 21:58.618
<i>Are you clawing your way
to the finish line?</i>

21:58.776 --> 22:01.905
<i>No, no, not at all.
Ahsha and I are like...</i>

22:02.071 --> 22:04.574
That was from the opening game
of the season.

22:04.740 --> 22:08.461
That was the worst day of my life
and she looked so happy.

22:10.371 --> 22:13.090
I'm sick of everything
happening to me.

22:14.083 --> 22:16.461
Even this All-Star thing was your idea.

22:16.585 --> 22:21.136
You have a beef with her but I'm the one
being publically humiliated as a result.

22:23.133 --> 22:27.229
I have to beat her.
Not for you, for me.

22:27.388 --> 22:30.858
And if people knowing
who my father is, is my only shot...

22:33.727 --> 22:38.198
- What are you saying, Ahsha?
- Tell whoever you have to tell.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.861
Tell the world.

22:48.659 --> 22:50.627
Terrence didn't send me.

22:52.746 --> 22:55.124
I know what you're going to say,

22:55.291 --> 22:57.293
so you shouldn't even bother.

23:01.422 --> 23:04.096
Don't think of me as the girlfriend.

23:04.258 --> 23:07.853
Think of me as someone who's been
in this organisation a while.

23:08.012 --> 23:12.483
- Someone who knows things.
- Like what?

23:12.641 --> 23:17.442
I know about your past.
You've been given a lot of chances.

23:17.605 --> 23:21.701
So many, the fact that you're now
the coach of this team speaks to that.

23:24.653 --> 23:28.749
So you want me to give Terrence
another chance,

23:28.908 --> 23:32.162
even though he tested positive
for a banned substance?

23:32.328 --> 23:34.080
I get the suspicion.

23:34.246 --> 23:37.841
Trust me, even though
I've never seen him do it,

23:38.000 --> 23:41.425
it still makes you think.

23:43.839 --> 23:47.013
But I'm choosing to believe him.

23:48.677 --> 23:54.229
I'm giving him that chance,
so should you.

23:58.020 --> 24:02.901
I wanted you to hear it from me.
I'm taking Terrence off the bench.

24:03.025 --> 24:07.531
You've stepped up,
shown initiative, responsibility.

24:07.696 --> 24:10.119
It looks good on you.

24:11.283 --> 24:14.036
- Coach Davenport, a word please!
- Over here!

24:14.203 --> 24:17.047
Coach Davenport, what can you tell us
about Ahsha Hayes?

24:17.206 --> 24:18.708
When did you find out
she was your daughter?

24:22.169 --> 24:24.638
There's got to be a dozen reporters
out there.

24:24.797 --> 24:27.266
- They know about Ahsha.
- What? It's true?

24:27.383 --> 24:28.726
Go to your office, Pete.
I'll handle the press.

24:28.884 --> 24:31.808
I have to warn Sloane.
How could this have gotten out?

24:31.971 --> 24:36.442
That's a great question.
I wonder how this did get out.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.444
Maybe the reporters
just did good digging.

24:39.603 --> 24:41.605
Maybe it was a slip of the tongue.

24:42.606 --> 24:48.409
Or maybe, just maybe,
Ahsha saw All-Stars slipping away

24:48.570 --> 24:51.289
and was so sick
of being your punching bag

24:51.448 --> 24:55.043
she picked the biggest weapon
she had to knock you out.

24:58.080 --> 25:00.082
Looks like you're out of moves.

25:24.189 --> 25:26.191
I bet your telescope is big.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.907
- Is it? Is it big?
- Yeah.

25:29.069 --> 25:32.869
Yeah? Big and powerful, huh?

25:33.032 --> 25:35.410
It's big, powerful.

25:36.869 --> 25:39.839
Can you do that upside-down
split thing? The one you did.

25:39.997 --> 25:42.546
I didn't do an upside down split
at the game.

25:42.708 --> 25:45.302
From your tape.

25:45.461 --> 25:48.590
I thought you didn't know
about my tape.

25:48.756 --> 25:53.603
Okay, I lied.
Actually I know quite a lot about you.

25:53.761 --> 25:55.729
You're from Vicksburg, Mississippi,

25:55.888 --> 25:59.313
your parents separated when you
were three but never divorced.

25:59.475 --> 26:03.480
You moved to Cali four years ago.
You were a dancer at Community Chest.

26:03.645 --> 26:05.989
Your credit score is 588.

26:06.148 --> 26:08.321
Oh, God, I'm in your binder.

26:08.484 --> 26:11.158
What was that guy's name?
Benny Wise?

26:12.780 --> 26:17.957
- That was a mess.
- Okay. I got to go.

26:23.123 --> 26:25.501
You know there's an art
to the Intel game.

26:26.752 --> 26:29.926
There's also an art to whatever you
were trying to do to me in that bed.

26:30.089 --> 26:32.638
What are you saying?

26:32.800 --> 26:36.395
I'm saying you blew it
and not in a good way.

26:43.852 --> 26:46.401
I heard you talked to coach.

26:46.563 --> 26:48.565
I hope you don't think I snipped
your balls because of it.

26:48.732 --> 26:51.076
I feel like my girl stuck up for me.

26:51.235 --> 26:55.786
Whatever she said worked
'cause I'm back off the bench.

27:01.495 --> 27:03.122
You believe I didn't do it, right?

27:04.790 --> 27:06.838
I wouldn't have gone to Pete if I did.

27:15.676 --> 27:21.399
I know trusting isn't easy for you.
You won't regret this.

27:45.414 --> 27:47.758
- LJ.
- You're Jesse.

27:47.916 --> 27:51.511
You're here to suck up to me? Go.

27:51.670 --> 27:54.765
You make it sound like
I've got 30 seconds on the clock.

27:54.923 --> 27:56.516
26 now.

27:59.094 --> 28:01.938
You should sign with me
'cause I'm the best.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.642
How much time have I got left?

28:06.643 --> 28:09.192
Everybody says they're the best,
Jesse.

28:09.354 --> 28:12.654
What I need is an agent
that will do anything for me.

28:17.613 --> 28:21.959
You mean, like...?

28:24.453 --> 28:29.505
- Your reputation is no joke.
- Then you know I'm not joking.

28:34.588 --> 28:40.061
And would I be, like,
on the top or the bottom?

28:46.725 --> 28:48.727
Do I look like a bottom to you?

28:51.480 --> 28:54.654
How far are you willing to go for 4%

28:54.816 --> 28:58.912
on a $135 million contract?

29:20.092 --> 29:21.469
<i>- Hello?
- Hello.</i>

29:21.635 --> 29:23.603
<i>I'm</i> a <i>reporter from Sports Illustrated.</i>

29:23.762 --> 29:28.359
<i>I wanted to ask you about Pete
Davenport and your daughter, Ahsha.</i>

29:31.019 --> 29:32.817
Ahsha!

29:51.915 --> 29:53.963
If it isn't the coach's daughter.

29:56.795 --> 29:59.423
- You know.
- Everybody knows.

29:59.589 --> 30:03.389
It makes sense now
why you've always been so spun out.

30:04.720 --> 30:06.472
They say you found out
after you made the team.

30:08.557 --> 30:11.276
I haven't talked about him out loud
around here.

30:11.435 --> 30:13.358
I don't know if I can right now.

30:14.855 --> 30:19.907
What I said the other day in the hallway,
My little pick-me speech.

30:20.068 --> 30:23.038
- I take it back.
- You take it back?

30:23.196 --> 30:26.996
Yeah, I was crazy emotional
about Terrence.

30:27.159 --> 30:31.835
You don't have to worry about me.
You have way too much on your plate.

30:35.917 --> 30:37.669
Take care.

30:53.685 --> 30:55.437
I had to unplug the phone.

30:55.604 --> 30:59.654
We've been getting calls non-stop from
reporters asking about Pete Davenport.

30:59.816 --> 31:01.409
I let Olivia tell people.

31:01.568 --> 31:04.913
She said it was the only way I could
beat Jelena in the All-Star vote.

31:05.072 --> 31:08.747
You're profiting from Pete when you
won't even give that guy the time of day?

31:08.909 --> 31:12.379
- Whoa.
- Whoa is right.

31:12.537 --> 31:15.757
The Ahsha I know
would have never done that.

31:18.126 --> 31:21.300
- What else have you done?
- What do you mean?

31:22.422 --> 31:26.052
What happened in the elevator
during the blackout?

31:26.218 --> 31:29.097
The power went out. I wasn't trying
to get stuck with Derek.

31:29.221 --> 31:31.144
Derek?

31:33.308 --> 31:35.902
Did you kiss him?

31:36.061 --> 31:41.363
No, I didn't. He kissed me.

31:45.028 --> 31:47.030
I knew it.

31:50.617 --> 31:55.088
I wanted so bad to be wrong,
but I knew it.

31:56.456 --> 32:00.256
I can't do this anymore. You, me--

32:00.419 --> 32:04.265
Are you breaking up with me?
It's not what you think.

32:04.381 --> 32:09.808
Maybe it's not, but how long am I
supposed to sit around until it is?

32:09.970 --> 32:14.100
A week? A month? Six months?

32:15.434 --> 32:20.281
I see where this is going,
even if you don't. Or won't.

32:21.481 --> 32:25.611
This world is sucking you in
and Derek's just a part of it.

32:27.612 --> 32:31.708
It's exciting, it's loud
and I'm not there.

32:33.034 --> 32:38.040
You're going faster and faster
and you're trying to hold on to me.

32:38.206 --> 32:44.964
I know you are but eventually,
you're going to let go.

32:45.130 --> 32:47.679
German!

32:47.841 --> 32:53.268
I know you love me and I love you.

32:55.432 --> 32:57.434
But this is happening, Ahsha.

32:59.394 --> 33:05.618
If I'm gonna have a shred
of anything left, any pride at all...

33:08.904 --> 33:13.580
I need to leave you
before you leave me.

33:13.700 --> 33:15.873
You said you would fight.

33:37.557 --> 33:40.731
- Where's Ahsha?
- She's not here.

33:41.978 --> 33:46.950
- Are you okay?
- No. Ahsha and I broke up.

33:47.108 --> 33:49.782
What? Why?

33:53.907 --> 33:56.501
Where is she?
I'm getting calls from reporters,

33:56.660 --> 33:59.288
They're asking about her
and her father, they know.

33:59.454 --> 34:02.082
- I have to warn her.
- She knows.

34:02.249 --> 34:04.877
She gave her boss permission
to leak it.

34:05.043 --> 34:08.638
Olivia? Olivia did this?

34:17.847 --> 34:20.851
- Smile!
- What the hell!

34:33.154 --> 34:35.156
- What is this?
- An insurance policy.

34:35.322 --> 34:37.324
You're dropping
all legal proceedings ASAP

34:37.492 --> 34:40.621
and I'll do my best to keep
what's on that phone to myself.

34:40.786 --> 34:42.915
You're not getting this back.

34:43.081 --> 34:47.382
Keep it. I just emailed the video
to myself. It's in the cloud now.

34:47.502 --> 34:52.178
Yeah. Sorry, bro. Can't sign with a guy
who can't handle his woman.

34:53.717 --> 34:57.688
All the times you screwed me
and finally, finally I screwed you.

34:59.097 --> 35:03.193
Oh, and don't bother swinging
by my place later. Tonight is off.

35:04.644 --> 35:08.069
You cannot even imagine the ways
you're gonna regret this, Raquel.

35:17.574 --> 35:20.202
Ms Hart, this was dropped off
for you earlier.

35:29.961 --> 35:33.135
I've never seen him so mad.
Actually, it was a little scary.

35:33.298 --> 35:34.800
Comes with the territory.

35:34.966 --> 35:39.437
<i>I just can't believe this is over,
I don't know what to say to you.</i>

35:40.639 --> 35:43.813
Actually, that's not true. I do.

35:44.809 --> 35:46.937
Thank you for giving me my son back.

35:48.605 --> 35:53.452
I did it stick it to Jesse.
I never liked the guy.

35:53.610 --> 35:56.784
Can I buy you a drink? Or a house?

35:58.448 --> 36:02.248
I can't. I have somewhere to be.

36:06.539 --> 36:11.966
A deal's a deal.
You delivered, now so will l.

36:12.962 --> 36:14.964
Terrence Wall stays a Devil

36:15.131 --> 36:18.931
and you get the one thing
you want more than anything.

36:20.804 --> 36:22.772
I want a lot of things.

36:28.103 --> 36:30.481
<i>But this'll do.</i>

36:39.739 --> 36:41.912
Thanks for the assist.

37:48.558 --> 37:53.985
Sloane, what are you doing here?

37:54.105 --> 37:55.732
You haven't changed.

37:55.899 --> 38:00.120
You're still the same toxic, opportunistic
snake in the grass you were when I left.

38:01.738 --> 38:03.706
I didn't do anything Ahsha didn't okay.

38:03.823 --> 38:06.326
I don't even want to hear you say
my daughter's name.

38:06.493 --> 38:09.337
You, me, and Pete,
we did our damage a long time ago,

38:09.496 --> 38:13.000
but if this can help her now and it will,
why shouldn't she use it?

38:13.166 --> 38:16.466
This isn't about her,
this is about you.

38:16.586 --> 38:22.514
Sloane, whether you like it or not,
she is going to be a star.

38:25.178 --> 38:27.146
Look into my eyes.

38:28.431 --> 38:32.652
Don't you ever give your bad advice
to my daughter again.

38:32.811 --> 38:36.816
- Where's Ahsha?
- All the girls left hours ago.

38:39.526 --> 38:41.870
Pete?

38:42.028 --> 38:46.204
A Devil Girl was found floating
under the Vincent Thomas Bridge.

38:51.496 --> 38:53.498
<i>Next, on the season finale
of Hit The Floor.</i>

38:57.043 --> 39:00.593
The Devils organisation is heartbroken
over the loss of one of its own.

39:00.755 --> 39:05.306
A shining star filled with
so much promise, gone too soon.

39:05.468 --> 39:09.769
And our hearts go out to all those
affected by her passing.

39:09.931 --> 39:14.311
You cut me deeper
than anyone has my whole life.

39:14.477 --> 39:15.820
I'm not stupid.

39:15.979 --> 39:19.108
- I have Olivia under control.
- That's my wife you're talking about.
