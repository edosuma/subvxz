R. B., don't!

09:58.130 --> 10:00.325
You think I'm dangerous,
Princess?

10:00.399 --> 10:01.889
Dang right I do!

10:01.968 --> 10:04.163
You killed
all my banana guards!

10:04.236 --> 10:06.830
No, Princess, look!
They're only bruised.

10:06.906 --> 10:08.305
[Guards groaning]

10:08.374 --> 10:09.500
Hey, you hit me.

10:09.575 --> 10:12.772
I no longer crave mindless
violence.

10:12.845 --> 10:15.609
I have found peace
in meditation, gardening...

10:15.681 --> 10:17.512
egg throwing.

10:17.583 --> 10:20.381
I hope time has also made you
less bloodthirsty, Princess.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.353
But do with me as you will.

10:22.421 --> 10:24.355
In my heart,
I still serve you...

10:24.423 --> 10:26.152
100%.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.052
TV:
<i>Bigger pimples mean bigger dimples,</i>

10:29.128 --> 10:30.493
<i>so mash up your mush...</i>

10:30.563 --> 10:32.121
BUBBLEGUM:
Ahem...

10:32.198 --> 10:34.257
Okay, everybody.

10:34.333 --> 10:36.631
I took care of Rattleballs.

10:36.702 --> 10:39.102
Ooh, wow. Cool.

10:39.171 --> 10:40.832
Show's back on.

10:42.000 --> 10:48.074

10:49.582 --> 10:51.777
Everything's settled.

10:51.851 --> 10:53.512
I don't have to go back
on my order,

10:53.586 --> 10:56.248
and you can protect
the kingdom from the shadows.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.914
Thank you, Princess.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.083
That's marginally better
than hiding in a dump.

11:00.159 --> 11:01.251
[Sighs]

11:01.327 --> 11:03.818
Wait.

11:03.896 --> 11:06.023
- Hmm?
- I dub thee...

11:06.098 --> 11:08.191
