WEBVTT

00:02.085 --> 00:04.546
Okay, I think I fixed the leak.

00:04.588 --> 00:07.424
Let me just reattach this here.

00:07.466 --> 00:09.134
Try it now.

00:09.176 --> 00:12.053
Now there's hot water

00:09.176 --> 00:12.053
coming out of both taps.

00:12.095 --> 00:13.848
What?

00:13.889 --> 00:15.307
Is that really so bad?

00:15.349 --> 00:16.976
You always complain

00:15.349 --> 00:16.976
there's not enough hot water.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.727
It wouldn't kill you

00:17.017 --> 00:18.727
to hire a professional

00:18.769 --> 00:20.061
every once in a while.

00:20.103 --> 00:22.063
It costs $70 just

00:20.103 --> 00:22.063
to get them in the house.

00:22.105 --> 00:23.691
Look, I know my work

00:22.105 --> 00:23.691
isn't perfect,

00:23.732 --> 00:25.233
but I am saving us

00:23.732 --> 00:25.233
a ton of money,

00:25.275 --> 00:27.569
and at least

00:25.275 --> 00:27.569
the job gets done.

00:29.279 --> 00:32.449
Now, if you'll excuse me,

00:29.279 --> 00:32.449
there's someone at the door.

01:09.152 --> 01:11.196
HAL:  The tension is palpable

01:09.152 --> 01:11.196
here at the 8,215th

01:11.238 --> 01:12.948
Daily Shaving Olympics.

01:12.990 --> 01:14.742
Hal has lost crucial seconds

01:12.990 --> 01:14.742
in his lathering,

01:14.783 --> 01:17.786
but he hopes to make it up

01:14.783 --> 01:17.786
with his blade work.

01:17.828 --> 01:19.120
This is for the gold.

01:19.162 --> 01:20.748
LOIS:

01:19.162 --> 01:20.748
Hal, boys, breakfast!

01:20.789 --> 01:22.041
Bacon Day!

01:26.169 --> 01:27.671
(grunting)

01:36.221 --> 01:37.932
Dewey, don't be scared,

01:37.973 --> 01:39.600
but there's a big spider

01:37.973 --> 01:39.600
next to you.

01:39.641 --> 01:43.395
Yeah, Dad. There's always

01:39.641 --> 01:43.395
a spider on Bacon Day.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.188
You know, I'm not

01:43.437 --> 01:45.188
feeling that good.

01:45.230 --> 01:47.024
I could give Dad

01:45.230 --> 01:47.024
some of mine,

01:47.066 --> 01:49.401
but that's not really

01:47.066 --> 01:49.401
in the true spirit of Bacon Day.

01:49.443 --> 01:50.569
Mom, my stomach hurts.

01:50.611 --> 01:51.820
So does mine.

01:51.862 --> 01:54.322
I'm not kidding,

01:51.862 --> 01:54.322
it's really sore.

01:54.364 --> 01:55.783
Ow! It hurts!

01:55.824 --> 01:56.617
Shut up, Reese.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.159
Mom...

01:56.658 --> 01:58.159
I see spots!

01:58.201 --> 01:59.828
Mommy!

01:59.870 --> 02:01.162
All right, that's enough.

02:01.204 --> 02:02.957
I don't care what test

02:01.204 --> 02:02.957
you didn't study for

02:02.998 --> 02:04.416
or what assignment

02:02.998 --> 02:04.416
you didn't do,

02:04.458 --> 02:05.751
you're going to school.

02:05.793 --> 02:06.877
You know, now that

02:05.793 --> 02:06.877
you mention it...

02:06.919 --> 02:08.378
Everybody's  going.

02:10.213 --> 02:12.173
Sir, what are you doing?

02:12.215 --> 02:13.842
Why are you taking

02:12.215 --> 02:13.842
away our TV?

02:13.884 --> 02:15.844
It's for your

02:13.884 --> 02:15.844
own good, cadet.

02:15.886 --> 02:18.179
But that is the only thing

02:15.886 --> 02:18.179
that makes this place bearable.

02:18.221 --> 02:21.182
Television rots

02:18.221 --> 02:21.182
the mind, cadet.

02:21.224 --> 02:23.018
How can you focus

02:21.224 --> 02:23.018
on your studies

02:23.060 --> 02:24.686
and improve

02:23.060 --> 02:24.686
your character

02:24.728 --> 02:28.607
if your brain is full of

02:24.728 --> 02:28.607
your Morks and your Mindys?

02:28.649 --> 02:31.192
Now you'll have time for

02:28.649 --> 02:31.192
more worthwhile endeavors.

02:31.234 --> 02:33.194
Write a letter. I'm sure

02:31.234 --> 02:33.194
your parole officers

02:33.236 --> 02:35.864
will appreciate

02:33.236 --> 02:35.864
the personal touch.

02:35.906 --> 02:38.700
Okay, that is ridiculous.

02:38.742 --> 02:39.827
I mean, we should do something.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.244
He's right.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.122
Spangler doesn't get

02:41.286 --> 02:43.122
to make arbitrary decisions

02:43.163 --> 02:44.623
about our lives.

02:44.665 --> 02:47.417
He can't tell us

02:44.665 --> 02:47.417
where to go and what to do.

02:47.459 --> 02:49.461
Oh, wait... he can.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.005
Face it, Francis,

02:51.046 --> 02:52.798
we're like prisoners

02:51.046 --> 02:52.798
but without the rights.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.215
Okay, so we're helpless.

02:54.257 --> 02:57.469
But even helpless people

02:54.257 --> 02:57.469
have options.

02:57.511 --> 03:00.055
History is full of supposedly

02:57.511 --> 03:00.055
powerless people

03:00.097 --> 03:03.058
who found a way to stand up

03:00.097 --> 03:03.058
to their oppressors.

03:03.100 --> 03:04.225
What are you talking about?

03:04.267 --> 03:05.894
Civil disobedience.

03:05.936 --> 03:07.646
You know, like a hunger strike.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.272
We could do that.

03:09.314 --> 03:12.233
I mean, he doesn't want a bunch

03:09.314 --> 03:12.233
of starving kids on his hands.

03:12.275 --> 03:13.234
That would totally work.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.235
I don't know.

03:14.277 --> 03:15.320
Isn't that

03:14.277 --> 03:15.320
a bit drastic?

03:15.362 --> 03:16.738
Can't we wait till

03:15.362 --> 03:16.738
after lunch?

03:16.780 --> 03:18.281
What are we having?

03:16.780 --> 03:18.281
Shepherd's pie.

03:18.323 --> 03:20.325
The strike starts now!

03:20.367 --> 03:21.743
(cheering)

03:22.870 --> 03:24.705
Malcolm, why are you

03:22.870 --> 03:24.705
walking like that?

03:24.746 --> 03:26.414
My side still hurts.

03:26.456 --> 03:27.958
But it's the weekend.

03:32.963 --> 03:34.715
Okay, everybody get in the car.

03:34.756 --> 03:36.717
We're going to the hospital.

03:39.511 --> 03:42.263
Mom, why does that man

03:39.511 --> 03:42.263
have a lightbulb stuck...

03:42.305 --> 03:45.100
Dewey, get away from there.

03:45.809 --> 03:47.102
Dad, you okay?

03:47.144 --> 03:48.145
I'm fine, son.

03:48.187 --> 03:50.147
Just not a big fan

03:48.187 --> 03:50.147
of hospitals.

03:50.189 --> 03:52.315
Oh, they can dress it up

03:50.189 --> 03:52.315
with plants and pictures,

03:52.357 --> 03:55.276
but let's face it, this

03:52.357 --> 03:55.276
place is a slaughterhouse.

03:55.318 --> 03:56.361
Hal...

03:57.487 --> 03:58.572
Okay, we've run some tests.

03:58.613 --> 04:00.281
His white count is 12.2,

04:00.323 --> 04:01.992
and with these acute

04:00.323 --> 04:01.992
abdominal pains,

04:02.034 --> 04:04.369
I'm pretty sure we're

04:02.034 --> 04:04.369
looking at appendicitis.

04:04.411 --> 04:05.453
We'll hold him

04:05.495 --> 04:06.997
for observation tonight,

04:07.039 --> 04:09.166
and then tomorrow

04:07.039 --> 04:09.166
he'll probably need surgery.

04:09.208 --> 04:10.375
I'm having surgery?

04:10.417 --> 04:12.293
There's nothing

04:10.417 --> 04:12.293
to worry about, son.

04:12.335 --> 04:14.295
You'll barely even have

04:12.335 --> 04:14.295
a scar.

04:14.337 --> 04:16.297
If you can just sign

04:14.337 --> 04:16.297
these release forms,

04:16.339 --> 04:18.133
we'll check him in.

04:18.175 --> 04:19.760
They're going

04:18.175 --> 04:19.760
to cut you open?

04:19.801 --> 04:21.220
Like a trout.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.387
Don't worry,

04:21.261 --> 04:22.387
you won't feel a thing;

04:22.429 --> 04:23.471
you'll be unconscious.

04:23.513 --> 04:24.973
Not necessarily.

04:25.015 --> 04:27.142
I saw this thing on TV

04:25.015 --> 04:27.142
where this guy woke up

04:27.184 --> 04:28.393
in the middle

04:27.184 --> 04:28.393
of his operation

04:28.435 --> 04:30.395
and could feel everything

04:28.435 --> 04:30.395
they were doing,

04:30.437 --> 04:34.315
but he was paralyzed

04:30.437 --> 04:34.315
and couldn't even scream.

04:34.357 --> 04:36.484
Reese, for the love of God,

04:34.357 --> 04:36.484
stop talking.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.112
Mom...

04:36.526 --> 04:38.112
Honey, don't worry about it.

04:38.153 --> 04:39.529
You're going to have

04:38.153 --> 04:39.529
your own TV,

04:39.571 --> 04:40.948
you're going to have

04:39.571 --> 04:40.948
people to wait on you;

04:40.989 --> 04:42.241
it's going to be

04:40.989 --> 04:42.241
a lot better

04:42.282 --> 04:43.366
than being at home.

04:46.078 --> 04:48.205
Why do I have to stay

04:46.078 --> 04:48.205
in the kids' ward?

04:48.247 --> 04:49.957
I'm sorry, honey,

04:48.247 --> 04:49.957
but you're six months too young

04:49.998 --> 04:50.999
to have an adult room.

04:51.041 --> 04:52.333
I hear if you're

04:51.041 --> 04:52.333
really good,

04:52.375 --> 04:55.045
they'll put apple juice

04:52.375 --> 04:55.045
in your sippy cup.

04:55.087 --> 04:56.337
(Hal whimpering)

04:56.379 --> 04:58.339
Dad, do you want to

04:56.379 --> 04:58.339
wait out in the car?

04:58.381 --> 04:59.800
(inhales deeply)

04:59.841 --> 05:01.384
No. I'm okay.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.220
I'm fine.

05:03.262 --> 05:04.972
I'm on a beach.

05:05.013 --> 05:07.348
There's the surf,

05:05.013 --> 05:07.348
there's sand,

05:07.390 --> 05:09.350
there's... needles.

05:09.392 --> 05:13.396
There's the horrible choking

05:09.392 --> 05:13.396
stench of hospital antiseptic.

05:13.438 --> 05:14.439
Hal!

05:14.481 --> 05:15.774
Coming.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.358
I think I better take

05:15.816 --> 05:17.358
your father home.

05:17.400 --> 05:18.819
You'll be okay.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.449
Hey, feel better, sport.

05:25.700 --> 05:26.994
Reese, give

05:25.700 --> 05:26.994
your brother a hug.

05:27.035 --> 05:28.036
Aw, Mom.

05:28.078 --> 05:29.704
Do it!

05:31.498 --> 05:33.000
If you tell anyone

05:31.498 --> 05:33.000
I hugged you,

05:33.041 --> 05:34.459
I'll put you

05:33.041 --> 05:34.459
right back in here.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.296
Bye.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.882
Why did she make him hug me?

05:42.467 --> 05:45.637
Wait.

05:42.467 --> 05:45.637
Why  did  she make him hug me?

05:46.888 --> 05:49.390
Wow, it's sure quiet

05:46.888 --> 05:49.390
without Malcolm here.

05:49.432 --> 05:50.684
Poor little guy.

05:50.725 --> 05:52.393
There's an extra pork chop.

05:50.725 --> 05:52.393
Mine!

05:54.896 --> 05:56.273
Go ahead. I'm stuffed.

05:56.315 --> 05:57.107
Me, too.

05:57.149 --> 05:58.483
So am I.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.694
I was just hoping someone

05:58.525 --> 06:00.694
would fight me for it.

06:02.445 --> 06:04.489
Hey, can we play

06:02.445 --> 06:04.489
"March and Conquer"?

06:04.531 --> 06:06.074
That game's no fun.

06:06.116 --> 06:08.702
Malcolm always creams us

06:06.116 --> 06:08.702
in, like, five minutes.

06:08.743 --> 06:10.120
Yeah, can we?

06:11.246 --> 06:12.789
I... don't know.

06:12.831 --> 06:14.415
Please?

06:14.457 --> 06:16.126
We need at least three people

06:14.457 --> 06:16.126
or we can't play.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.046
Oh, all right.

06:19.087 --> 06:20.297
(laughter, cheering)

06:20.339 --> 06:21.422
Okay, Lois,

06:21.464 --> 06:23.424
let's see how well

06:21.464 --> 06:23.424
you defend the Black Sea

06:23.466 --> 06:25.426
without Bosporus

06:23.466 --> 06:25.426
and the Dardanelles.

06:25.468 --> 06:27.721
Yeah, yeah, just wait.

06:27.762 --> 06:29.931
Wow, it's been an hour

06:27.762 --> 06:29.931
and I'm still in the game.

06:29.973 --> 06:32.600
I usually tip the board

06:29.973 --> 06:32.600
over way before now.

06:32.642 --> 06:34.435
Guess what?

06:34.477 --> 06:36.437
We look just like

06:34.477 --> 06:36.437
the family on the box.

06:36.479 --> 06:37.731
Oh, yeah.

06:37.772 --> 06:39.358
Can I be the little girl?

06:39.398 --> 06:41.193
Not on my watch, son.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.117
You want to play

06:47.490 --> 06:49.117
"Go Fish"?

06:49.159 --> 06:53.163
No. I didn't want to

06:49.159 --> 06:53.163
play five minutes ago.

06:53.205 --> 06:56.083
I didn't want to play

06:53.205 --> 06:56.083
an hour ago.

06:56.124 --> 06:58.459
I don't want to play!

07:00.503 --> 07:02.089
You got any fives?

07:02.130 --> 07:03.464
(door opens)

07:03.506 --> 07:05.466
And this is our

07:03.506 --> 07:05.466
inflamed appendix.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.969
The patient arrived today

07:05.508 --> 07:07.969
complaining

07:08.011 --> 07:10.471
of abdominal pain

07:08.011 --> 07:10.471
in the right lower quadrant.

07:10.513 --> 07:11.723
Ow!

07:11.765 --> 07:13.558
We're going to have

07:11.765 --> 07:13.558
to start him on an I.V.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.102
Cathryn?

07:15.143 --> 07:15.936
Oh, God.

07:15.977 --> 07:17.187
Not me again.

07:17.229 --> 07:18.521
Please!

07:18.563 --> 07:20.274
It'll be fine

07:18.563 --> 07:20.274
this time, Cathryn.

07:20.315 --> 07:21.775
Accidents happen.

07:21.816 --> 07:23.985
Can maybe someone else...

07:21.816 --> 07:23.985
Helmut will hold him still.

07:30.533 --> 07:32.493
(muffled scream)

07:32.535 --> 07:34.121
If you feel pain,

07:34.162 --> 07:37.707
you can bite down on his hand

07:34.162 --> 07:37.707
just as hard as you want.

07:37.749 --> 07:39.459
Helmut won't mind.

07:45.215 --> 07:47.384
How long has it been

07:45.215 --> 07:47.384
since we ate?

07:47.426 --> 07:50.304
33 hours, 12 minutes.

07:50.345 --> 07:52.764
Oh, man, they're serving

07:50.345 --> 07:52.764
dinner right now.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.224
(sniffs)

07:52.806 --> 07:54.224
Ten-hut!

07:57.560 --> 08:02.523
I found myself eating

07:57.560 --> 08:02.523
the last several meals alone.

08:02.565 --> 08:04.025
Are we dieting?

08:04.067 --> 08:06.569
Don't tell me

08:04.067 --> 08:06.569
it's prom season already.

08:06.611 --> 08:08.405
We're on a hunger strike, sir.

08:08.447 --> 08:10.740
We're not eating until

08:08.447 --> 08:10.740
you return the television.

08:10.782 --> 08:14.911
Ah... passive resistance.

08:14.953 --> 08:18.415
The last resort

08:14.953 --> 08:18.415
of slackers and sissies.

08:18.457 --> 08:19.540
What about Gandhi?

08:19.582 --> 08:21.251
Sissy.

08:21.293 --> 08:23.544
We're making a stand here, sir.

08:23.586 --> 08:25.922
We will not back down

08:23.586 --> 08:25.922
until we get justice.

08:25.964 --> 08:27.632
Now let me see

08:25.964 --> 08:27.632
if I've got this straight.

08:27.674 --> 08:32.262
I get to continue to eat,

08:27.674 --> 08:32.262
but you don't.

08:32.304 --> 08:35.098
Ooh, I feel

08:32.304 --> 08:35.098
the pressure already.

08:36.391 --> 08:40.061
Ow, make it stop.

08:41.438 --> 08:43.523
♪ ♪

09:10.675 --> 09:12.593
Go, Mom! Nice!

09:12.635 --> 09:13.594
Go, Mom!

09:13.636 --> 09:15.596
Okay, you can do this

09:13.636 --> 09:15.596
the easy way

09:15.638 --> 09:17.015
and surrender with dignity,

09:17.057 --> 09:18.392
or I can destroy you.

09:18.433 --> 09:21.019
You forget,

09:18.433 --> 09:21.019
I still have Antarctica,

09:21.061 --> 09:22.312
gateway to New Zealand.

09:22.354 --> 09:23.480
You got nothing.

09:23.522 --> 09:24.647
Any roll

09:23.522 --> 09:24.647
other than three,

09:24.689 --> 09:26.607
and the world is mine.

09:26.649 --> 09:28.527
Three, three, three.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.528
Three.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.238
Yeah!

09:29.569 --> 09:31.238
Yay!

09:29.569 --> 09:31.238
Yes!

09:31.279 --> 09:32.864
Oh, sorry, honey,

09:31.279 --> 09:32.864
you tried really hard.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.615
And for a while there, I thought

09:32.906 --> 09:34.615
you might actually be...

09:34.657 --> 09:36.117
Rematch.

09:36.159 --> 09:37.494
All right.

09:37.536 --> 09:39.620
Hal, it's after

09:37.536 --> 09:39.620
midnight.

09:37.536 --> 09:39.620
Rematch.

09:39.662 --> 09:42.499
Set up the board.

09:42.541 --> 09:43.750
I'll do it.

09:45.168 --> 09:47.337
Here he is.

09:48.171 --> 09:49.630
What?

09:49.672 --> 09:52.759
You just keep quiet.

09:49.672 --> 09:52.759
You're in good hands.

09:53.885 --> 09:55.303
This is to keep

09:53.885 --> 09:55.303
your head still

09:55.345 --> 09:58.098
so Mr. Laser

09:55.345 --> 09:58.098
can do his job.

09:58.139 --> 09:59.224
Huh?

09:59.266 --> 10:00.600
Psst.

10:12.404 --> 10:14.281
Shh.

10:24.207 --> 10:25.959
Oh, I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

10:24.207 --> 10:25.959
They made me use a bedpan

10:26.000 --> 10:27.710
even though I could walk.

10:27.752 --> 10:29.670
They turned off the lights at

10:27.752 --> 10:29.670
6:30 so I couldn't even read.

10:29.712 --> 10:32.966
And last night, some man

10:29.712 --> 10:32.966
put a metal cage on my head.

10:33.007 --> 10:34.759
They were going to operate

10:33.007 --> 10:34.759
on my brain.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.303
(snickers):

10:34.801 --> 10:36.303
Bedpan.

10:36.344 --> 10:37.678
Sweetie, I'm sure

10:37.720 --> 10:39.097
it was just a bad dream.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.848
Besides, I'm feeling

10:39.139 --> 10:40.848
a lot better now.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.559
I don't even think

10:40.890 --> 10:42.559
I need surgery.

10:42.601 --> 10:44.352
It's okay. Surgery makes

10:42.601 --> 10:44.352
everybody a little scared.

10:44.394 --> 10:46.729
Trust me, this is going

10:44.394 --> 10:46.729
to be over before you know it.

10:46.771 --> 10:49.190
HAL: (groans) Between

10:46.771 --> 10:49.190
the stench of disease

10:49.232 --> 10:52.693
and all those waffles,

10:49.232 --> 10:52.693
I don't feel very well.

10:52.735 --> 10:53.694
What waffles?

10:53.736 --> 10:54.695
Oh, man, you missed it.

10:54.737 --> 10:55.905
We went to Pancake Pete's.

10:55.947 --> 10:57.698
We never go out to breakfast.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.993
Well, we stayed up late

10:57.740 --> 10:59.993
playing March and Conquer,

11:00.034 --> 11:01.620
and your mother was

11:00.034 --> 11:01.620
too tired to cook.

11:01.661 --> 11:04.205
You guys played

11:01.661 --> 11:04.205
March and Conquer without me?

11:04.247 --> 11:05.957
Oh, Malcolm, you didn't

11:04.247 --> 11:05.957
miss anything last night.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.542
These guys

11:05.999 --> 11:07.542
are a bunch of pushovers.

11:07.584 --> 11:11.296
Pushovers? I held

11:07.584 --> 11:11.296
Kamchatka for three hours.

11:11.338 --> 11:12.713
Look, we're going to take

11:11.338 --> 11:12.713
the boys home,

11:12.755 --> 11:14.132
and then your dad and I

11:12.755 --> 11:14.132
will be back

11:14.174 --> 11:15.716
in time for your operation,

11:14.174 --> 11:15.716
okay?

11:19.179 --> 11:21.889
Dewey, you're

11:19.179 --> 11:21.889
wearing my shirt.

11:21.931 --> 11:24.017
Am I?

11:25.393 --> 11:27.686
(stomachs grumbling)

11:30.773 --> 11:32.733
I'm so hungry.

11:32.775 --> 11:35.236
I think

11:32.775 --> 11:35.236
we proved our point.

11:35.278 --> 11:40.741
Guys, this hunger strike will

11:35.278 --> 11:40.741
only work if we stick together.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.661
Now, we can do this.

11:42.701 --> 11:44.120
Our stomachs have shrunk.

11:44.162 --> 11:45.622
The hardest part is over.

11:45.664 --> 11:48.458
SPANGLER:

11:45.664 --> 11:48.458
Good morning, cadets.

11:48.500 --> 11:51.919
I must say, it is inspiring

11:51.961 --> 11:53.921
to see young men

11:51.961 --> 11:53.921
with the courage

11:53.963 --> 11:56.841
to stand up for

11:53.963 --> 11:56.841
the things they believe in.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.843
Two whole days.

11:58.885 --> 12:02.180
What an impressive show

11:58.885 --> 12:02.180
of civil disobedience.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.391
That's the kind of

12:02.222 --> 12:04.391
intestinal fortitude

12:04.432 --> 12:07.852
that can only be properly

12:04.432 --> 12:07.852
honored by an omelet bar.

12:07.894 --> 12:10.188
(sizzling)

12:12.190 --> 12:14.359
Tempting us with food

12:12.190 --> 12:14.359
isn't going to work, sir.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.610
Of course not.

12:15.652 --> 12:16.861
These delicious eggs

12:16.903 --> 12:19.239
and choice of scrumptious

12:16.903 --> 12:19.239
fillings are for me.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.781
Now, here's my dilemma.

12:20.823 --> 12:23.368
What shall I put

12:20.823 --> 12:23.368
in my omelet?

12:23.410 --> 12:25.245
Black forest ham?

12:25.286 --> 12:26.787
Imported cheese?

12:26.829 --> 12:28.831
Porcini mushrooms?

12:28.873 --> 12:30.833
Porcini?

12:30.875 --> 12:32.085
Oh, what the heck!

12:32.126 --> 12:33.461
Give me the works.

12:33.503 --> 12:35.714
Mmm.

12:35.754 --> 12:38.174
DABNEY: There's our

12:35.754 --> 12:38.174
fallen comrade.

12:38.216 --> 12:40.009
I love Room 124.

12:40.051 --> 12:42.178
STEVE:

12:40.051 --> 12:42.178
When's the...

12:42.220 --> 12:44.013
appendix...

12:44.055 --> 12:45.806
coming out?

12:45.848 --> 12:47.850
Tonight, but-- I don't know--

12:45.848 --> 12:47.850
I'm feeling better.

12:47.892 --> 12:49.768
Maybe I don't need

12:47.892 --> 12:49.768
the operation.

12:50.853 --> 12:51.854
What are you talking about?!

12:51.896 --> 12:53.523
Of course

12:51.896 --> 12:53.523
you need the operation!

12:53.565 --> 12:55.108
But what if...

12:53.565 --> 12:55.108
Don't you understand?

12:55.149 --> 12:56.817
You're sitting on a gold mine.

12:56.859 --> 12:59.904
Ride the guilt train, baby,

12:56.859 --> 12:59.904
as far as it'll take you.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.740
My adenoids got

12:59.946 --> 13:01.740
me this watch.

13:01.780 --> 13:05.368
My strangulated testicle

13:01.780 --> 13:05.368
got me a week at Disneyland.

13:06.160 --> 13:09.830
I'm one.... procedure...

13:09.872 --> 13:11.832
from a...

13:11.874 --> 13:13.876
Range Rover.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.755
Well, we got two hours

13:15.169 --> 13:16.755
till we have to

13:16.795 --> 13:17.880
go back to the hospital.

13:17.922 --> 13:19.716
You want to order in

13:17.922 --> 13:19.716
or eat leftovers?

13:19.758 --> 13:20.925
Well, I'd say "you decide,"

13:20.967 --> 13:22.843
but then I'd be a

13:20.967 --> 13:22.843
pushover, wouldn't I?

13:22.885 --> 13:24.011
What are you talking about?

13:24.053 --> 13:25.430
March and Conquer.

13:25.472 --> 13:26.847
You called me a pushover.

13:26.889 --> 13:27.890
Don't deny it.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.768
Come on, honey, I trounced you.

13:29.808 --> 13:31.770
Just because you got

13:29.808 --> 13:31.770
all the good dice rolls

13:31.810 --> 13:33.854
and you weren't saddled

13:31.810 --> 13:33.854
with Brazil to protect.

13:33.896 --> 13:35.356
A-And I wouldn't

13:33.896 --> 13:35.356
call it "trounced."

13:35.398 --> 13:36.691
What would you say?

13:36.733 --> 13:37.816
Demolished?

13:38.901 --> 13:41.488
Creamed?

13:41.529 --> 13:44.324
Annihilated?

13:44.365 --> 13:46.825
Get the board.

13:48.995 --> 13:50.497
How are you, Tiger?

13:50.538 --> 13:53.166
I want you to note

13:50.538 --> 13:53.166
the bedside manner.

13:53.207 --> 13:54.459
Dr. Harrison,

13:53.207 --> 13:54.459
I'm glad you're here.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.503
I wanted to talk to you.

13:56.544 --> 13:58.338
I feeling a lot better now,

13:58.379 --> 13:59.880
and my temperature's been down

13:58.379 --> 13:59.880
for six hours,

13:59.922 --> 14:02.175
and I'm thinking

13:59.922 --> 14:02.175
that maybe my first blood test

14:02.216 --> 14:03.884
wasn't accurate.

14:03.926 --> 14:06.179
Now, this is what we call

14:03.926 --> 14:06.179
a hysterical patient.

14:06.220 --> 14:07.888
I'm not hysterical.

14:07.930 --> 14:09.890
I just think it'd be smart

14:07.930 --> 14:09.890
to run another blood test

14:09.932 --> 14:11.601
before you commit

14:09.932 --> 14:11.601
to cutting me open.

14:11.643 --> 14:13.812
Why, that's a terrific idea.

14:13.852 --> 14:15.772
Really terrific. (chuckles)

14:15.814 --> 14:17.440
We'll see you later.

14:18.650 --> 14:20.901
What's wrong with you people?!

14:20.943 --> 14:22.696
Labs make mistakes!

14:22.737 --> 14:24.739
Listen to me!

14:24.781 --> 14:27.908
I declare war

14:24.781 --> 14:27.908
on that blue country!

14:27.950 --> 14:29.369
Reese, why

14:27.950 --> 14:29.369
are you attacking me?

14:29.410 --> 14:30.411
Your dad's wide open.

14:30.453 --> 14:32.163
What are you

14:30.453 --> 14:32.163
saying, Lois,

14:32.205 --> 14:34.791
that the boys and I have formed

14:32.205 --> 14:34.791
a secret alliance against you?

14:34.833 --> 14:36.334
(chuckles)

14:36.376 --> 14:39.879
Hal, that's my foot

14:36.376 --> 14:39.879
you're tapping Morse code onto.

14:41.005 --> 14:43.924
(stomachs grumbling)

14:43.966 --> 14:45.926
I can't take this anymore.

14:45.968 --> 14:49.556
If I don't eat soon,

14:45.968 --> 14:49.556
I'm going to pass out.

14:49.597 --> 14:51.140
This isn't worth it.

14:51.182 --> 14:52.933
I agree with Finley.

14:52.975 --> 14:54.811
Who are you?

14:54.853 --> 14:56.521
Your roommate.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.523
Oh. Yeah.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.941
Hey, after the luau,

14:58.565 --> 15:00.941
you want to go parasailing?

15:00.983 --> 15:01.984
What?

15:02.026 --> 15:03.737
Snap out of it.

15:03.778 --> 15:05.946
You're talking crazy.

15:05.988 --> 15:07.365
Why would we have a luau

15:07.407 --> 15:09.367
when we're trapped in

15:07.407 --> 15:09.367
a disabled submarine?

15:09.409 --> 15:10.660
Wait.

15:10.702 --> 15:11.952
I hear tapping.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.954
Come on, guys,

15:11.994 --> 15:13.954
we're doing good.

15:13.996 --> 15:16.249
I think we're on

15:13.996 --> 15:16.249
the right track here.

15:16.290 --> 15:19.960
If we keep this up,

15:16.290 --> 15:19.960
Commandant...

15:20.002 --> 15:21.379
Uh...

15:21.421 --> 15:21.962
Spangler?

15:22.004 --> 15:24.257
Yes. Spangler.

15:24.298 --> 15:26.175
Commandant Spangler

15:24.298 --> 15:26.175
will have no choice

15:26.217 --> 15:28.010
but to meet our demands.

15:28.052 --> 15:30.221
Francis?

15:34.016 --> 15:35.560
It's time we talked.

15:35.602 --> 15:38.438
Will you gentlemen

15:35.602 --> 15:38.438
excuse us, please?

15:54.036 --> 15:56.038
Take your time.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.793
Yes! Madagascar is mine!

15:59.834 --> 16:01.419
Let me see those dice.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.838
Are you accusing me

16:01.461 --> 16:03.838
of cheating?!

16:03.880 --> 16:05.506
Don't be ridiculous.

16:07.508 --> 16:09.510
(knocking)

16:11.053 --> 16:12.889
That's the pizza

16:11.053 --> 16:12.889
delivery man.

16:12.931 --> 16:14.014
Why don't you get it?

16:14.056 --> 16:15.934
(chuckles)

16:15.975 --> 16:18.394
So my artillery can

16:15.975 --> 16:18.394
mysteriously disappear

16:18.436 --> 16:21.021
like it did when I went

16:18.436 --> 16:21.021
to get a glass of water.

16:21.063 --> 16:22.523
Or when I went to the bathroom

16:22.565 --> 16:25.025
and your tanks just materialized

16:22.565 --> 16:25.025
on my border.

16:25.067 --> 16:26.694
I'm not getting it.

16:26.736 --> 16:28.988
(knocking)

16:31.699 --> 16:33.493
Come in!

16:33.534 --> 16:35.662
WOMAN:

16:33.534 --> 16:35.662
It's locked!

16:37.163 --> 16:38.665
Try the window!

16:38.706 --> 16:40.040
What?!

16:40.082 --> 16:41.918
Haven't you ever delivered

16:40.082 --> 16:41.918
pizza before?!

16:41.960 --> 16:43.628
Come in through the window!

16:43.670 --> 16:46.130
It's locked, too!

16:51.928 --> 16:54.597
Okay, thanks anyway!

17:00.728 --> 17:03.648
Here. Take this.

17:03.690 --> 17:04.941
What's this for?

17:04.983 --> 17:06.233
Sedatives.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.277
Your surgery has

17:06.275 --> 17:08.277
been moved up.

17:08.319 --> 17:09.487
What do you mean, moved up?

17:09.529 --> 17:10.905
My parents aren't even here.

17:10.947 --> 17:13.741
I'm sure they've

17:10.947 --> 17:13.741
been notified.

17:13.783 --> 17:15.075
Look, I'm not taking these

17:15.117 --> 17:17.077
until after I get

17:15.117 --> 17:17.077
another blood test.

17:17.119 --> 17:19.079
Take the pills.

17:19.121 --> 17:20.456
No! I'm not going to!

17:20.498 --> 17:22.792
You can't force...

17:24.168 --> 17:25.753
I know you are frightened,

17:25.795 --> 17:28.088
and that is normal

17:25.795 --> 17:28.088
for a little boy.

17:28.130 --> 17:31.091
But now you must let

17:28.130 --> 17:31.091
the grown-ups handle things.

17:31.133 --> 17:35.179
All you have to do is relax

17:31.133 --> 17:35.179
and let the pills take effect.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.099
That's a good boy.

17:39.141 --> 17:41.060
(spits)

17:39.141 --> 17:41.060
(groans)

17:59.412 --> 18:01.205
It's your move, Reese.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.123
What are you going to do?

18:03.165 --> 18:04.208
I don't know!

18:04.250 --> 18:05.543
I'm hungry.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.211
Reese, if you attack me,

18:05.585 --> 18:07.211
you're grounded.

18:07.253 --> 18:09.171
If you don't attack

18:07.253 --> 18:09.171
her, you're grounded!

18:09.213 --> 18:10.339
Stop it!

18:10.381 --> 18:12.050
I don't want

18:10.381 --> 18:12.050
to play anymore!

18:12.091 --> 18:13.133
I hate this game.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.385
It's never been this horrible,

18:14.427 --> 18:16.971
even when Malcolm

18:14.427 --> 18:16.971
was kicking our butts.

18:18.973 --> 18:20.433
He's right.

18:20.474 --> 18:22.142
Look what we've become.

18:22.184 --> 18:24.144
Without Malcolm

18:22.184 --> 18:24.144
humiliating us,

18:24.186 --> 18:26.146
our worst competitive

18:24.186 --> 18:26.146
instincts took over.

18:26.188 --> 18:30.068
I'm ashamed for all of us.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.445
So, you're quitting?

18:32.486 --> 18:34.154
Let it go, Lois.

18:34.196 --> 18:36.156
Ah, you're right.

18:36.198 --> 18:38.076
Reese, do the honors.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.829
Good. Now, who

18:39.619 --> 18:41.829
wants to go outside

18:41.871 --> 18:44.164
and watch me burn

18:41.871 --> 18:44.164
the evil game?

18:44.206 --> 18:45.332
(cheering)

18:45.374 --> 18:47.001
I have to admit, cadet,

18:47.043 --> 18:49.420
I thought you boys would

18:47.043 --> 18:49.420
have surrendered by now,

18:49.462 --> 18:51.589
but instead,

18:49.462 --> 18:51.589
you have shown

18:51.631 --> 18:53.674
(distorted):

18:51.631 --> 18:53.674
strength of will, teamwork,

18:53.716 --> 18:55.175
and a willingness to sacrifice.

18:55.217 --> 18:56.844
Well done.

18:56.886 --> 18:58.471
With what?

18:58.512 --> 18:59.680
The strike.

18:59.722 --> 19:01.557
Right, right, the strike.

19:01.599 --> 19:04.018
Well, that's good, 'cause...

19:04.060 --> 19:05.979
we weren't going to do...

19:06.020 --> 19:09.649
the thing...

19:06.020 --> 19:09.649
until we got back...

19:10.858 --> 19:12.068
Well, you know.

19:13.736 --> 19:16.238
Yes, I believe I do.

19:17.406 --> 19:20.200
(distorted):

19:17.406 --> 19:20.200
Shall we discuss terms?

19:20.242 --> 19:21.368
We did it.

19:21.410 --> 19:22.662
The strike's over.

19:22.703 --> 19:23.663
We won!

19:23.704 --> 19:25.790
(cheering)

19:25.832 --> 19:28.709
We got his magic hat!

19:29.669 --> 19:31.253
What about

19:29.669 --> 19:31.253
the television?

19:31.295 --> 19:33.631
Huh?

19:37.551 --> 19:39.219
Here's your

19:37.551 --> 19:39.219
blood test, man.

19:39.261 --> 19:40.596
Thanks. Here's my urine.

19:40.638 --> 19:42.431
Good luck on the drug test,

19:42.473 --> 19:44.851
but I really think

19:42.473 --> 19:44.851
you should get some help.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.228
I knew it!

19:50.314 --> 19:51.398
Oh, good-- Helmut.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.233
I've been looking all over

19:51.440 --> 19:53.233
for you.

19:53.275 --> 19:54.610
I have great news.

19:54.652 --> 19:56.236
You see, I just had

19:54.652 --> 19:56.236
another blood test,

19:56.278 --> 19:58.948
and it shows that I really

19:56.278 --> 19:58.948
don't need surgery, because...

19:58.990 --> 20:00.533
If the blood count

19:58.990 --> 20:00.533
goes down to normal,

20:00.574 --> 20:02.242
that means

20:00.574 --> 20:02.242
it isn't appendicitis.

20:02.284 --> 20:03.494
It was probably

20:02.284 --> 20:03.494
just a transient infection

20:03.536 --> 20:05.245
or maybe even a cold sore.

20:05.287 --> 20:07.206
Yes, little boy.

20:10.292 --> 20:13.880
I need...

20:10.292 --> 20:13.880
to talk to Dr. Harrison.

20:13.921 --> 20:15.756
Count backwards from a hundred.

20:15.798 --> 20:18.092
HARRISON:

20:15.798 --> 20:18.092
Hi there, sport.

20:18.134 --> 20:20.136
We'll have that

20:18.134 --> 20:20.136
appendix out in no time.

20:20.178 --> 20:21.554
(weak mumbling)

20:23.305 --> 20:25.474
HARRISON:

20:23.305 --> 20:25.474
Okay, scalpel.

20:25.516 --> 20:28.186
Huh? Hold on a second.

20:30.312 --> 20:32.065
"Do not operate.

20:32.106 --> 20:35.693
'H' and 'H': 16 and 47,

20:32.106 --> 20:35.693
platelets: 310..."

20:35.735 --> 20:38.278
These are blood

20:35.735 --> 20:38.278
test results.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.488
"White count: 8.4"?

20:39.530 --> 20:41.281
Is that right?

20:41.323 --> 20:43.283
"I will sue your ass

20:41.323 --> 20:43.283
for malpract..."

20:43.325 --> 20:46.996
Uh, maybe we should

20:43.325 --> 20:46.996
run another blood test.

20:47.038 --> 20:48.288
Spangler was right.

20:48.330 --> 20:50.124
Who needs television?

20:50.166 --> 20:51.458
This is nice.

20:51.500 --> 20:55.462
Get some fresh air,

20:51.500 --> 20:55.462
some exercise.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.297
Nice drive.

20:57.339 --> 20:58.298
Thanks.

20:58.340 --> 21:00.467
I think this

20:58.340 --> 21:00.467
hat is magic.

21:00.509 --> 21:02.302
(chuckling)

21:02.344 --> 21:04.304
Right, Francis?

21:04.346 --> 21:05.347
Uh-huh.

21:05.389 --> 21:08.267
Oh, remember

21:05.389 --> 21:08.267
to replace your divots.

21:10.352 --> 21:11.771
There's nothing

21:10.352 --> 21:11.771
like two days at the hospital

21:11.812 --> 21:13.606
to make you appreciate

21:11.812 --> 21:13.606
your own home.

21:13.647 --> 21:14.690
Give me that!

21:14.732 --> 21:15.775
Oh, my God!

21:15.816 --> 21:17.317
Look at Malcolm's

21:15.816 --> 21:17.317
hospital bill.

21:17.359 --> 21:18.903
I'd hate to think

21:17.359 --> 21:18.903
what it'd cost

21:18.945 --> 21:20.320
if he'd actually

21:18.945 --> 21:20.320
had the operation.

21:20.362 --> 21:22.322
There goes

21:20.362 --> 21:22.322
our summer vacation.

21:22.364 --> 21:25.785
So we have to pay even

21:22.364 --> 21:25.785
though he was faking?

21:25.826 --> 21:27.327
I wasn't faking.

21:27.369 --> 21:29.163
I'm the one who figured out

21:27.369 --> 21:29.163
they were wrong, remember?

21:29.205 --> 21:30.998
Well, if you're

21:29.205 --> 21:30.998
such a genius,

21:31.040 --> 21:33.167
why didn't you

21:31.040 --> 21:33.167
figure it out sooner?

21:33.209 --> 21:36.587
Well, son, you want

21:33.209 --> 21:36.587
to answer that for us all?

21:36.629 --> 21:38.338
Nothing like ten seconds at home

21:38.380 --> 21:40.549
to make you appreciate

21:38.380 --> 21:40.549
the hospital.
