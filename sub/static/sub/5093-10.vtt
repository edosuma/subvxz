WEBVTT

00:06.762 --> 00:08.680
Sorry, but giving up
is not my "fort."

00:08.682 --> 00:09.931
You mean "for-tay""

00:09.933 --> 00:11.883
No, I mean "fort,"
it's pronounced "fort."

00:11.885 --> 00:13.267
How much you want to bet?

00:13.269 --> 00:16.303
Oh, well, I'll bet you the
house, but you know what?

00:16.305 --> 00:17.471
Let's start with 20 bucks.

00:17.473 --> 00:18.573
I'll go easy on you.

00:18.575 --> 00:19.557
Done.

00:19.559 --> 00:21.242
Let's see.

00:21.244 --> 00:22.777
It begins with an "F."

00:22.779 --> 00:24.829
Yes, I'm aware of that.

00:24.831 --> 00:27.248
Forte-- pronounced "fort,"
not "for-tay."

00:27.250 --> 00:28.499
Read it and weep.

00:28.501 --> 00:29.500
Can't be.

00:29.502 --> 00:31.586
Oh, but it so can be.

00:33.172 --> 00:35.123
Mm-hmm, come on.
(groans)

00:35.125 --> 00:36.874
Hey, Strunk and White, you done?

00:36.876 --> 00:38.509
Yeah, we're done, Sarge.

00:38.511 --> 00:39.510
Thank you.

00:39.512 --> 00:41.129
You asked me last week
for a heads up

00:41.131 --> 00:43.831
next time we got
a bad traffic accident, right?

00:43.833 --> 00:45.383
Yeah, why?
Well, we just got

00:45.385 --> 00:47.385
two cars go through
the guardrail,

00:47.387 --> 00:49.437
over the edge of the BQE.

00:49.439 --> 00:50.555
Two cars.

00:50.557 --> 00:51.606
Okay, you know what?

00:51.608 --> 00:52.807
Uh, we'll check it out.

00:52.809 --> 00:55.176
Since when do detectives
catch car accidents?

00:55.178 --> 00:56.894
When they don't think
they're accidents.

00:56.896 --> 00:58.363
Come on.

01:01.367 --> 01:03.401
(helicopter blades whirring)

01:03.403 --> 01:05.570
(siren wailing)

01:11.526 --> 01:13.711
(overlapping shouting)

01:21.920 --> 01:23.638
Detective Reagan.
This is Detective Lansing.

01:23.640 --> 01:24.689
What can you tell us?

01:24.691 --> 01:26.057
What you see is
what you get.

01:27.760 --> 01:30.178
The woman driving the SUV
fell asleep at the wheel,

01:30.180 --> 01:31.979
wound up driving herself
and this poor bastard

01:31.981 --> 01:32.930
over the edge.

01:32.932 --> 01:34.015
Both DOA?

01:34.017 --> 01:34.982
That's right.

01:34.984 --> 01:36.017
This falling asleep
at the wheel--

01:36.019 --> 01:37.018
where'd you get that from?

01:37.020 --> 01:38.169
That's what
two eyewitnesses say.

01:38.171 --> 01:39.504
Where are the eyewitnesses?

01:39.506 --> 01:40.772
They had to go to work,
you know.

01:40.774 --> 01:41.856
We took their statements.

01:41.858 --> 01:42.890
You let
the eyewitnesses leave?

01:42.892 --> 01:44.391
You know, <i>Psychology</i>
<i>Today</i> says

01:44.393 --> 01:47.328
eyewitness testimony isn't
as reliable as we thought.

01:47.330 --> 01:48.446
Psychology Today?

01:48.448 --> 01:49.447
You don't read it?

01:49.449 --> 01:51.032
You do?
I do.

01:51.034 --> 01:52.366
Look, I don't read
much of anything,

01:52.368 --> 01:53.918
but I agree with
her on this.

01:53.920 --> 01:55.503
I don't have much faith
in the testimony

01:55.505 --> 01:57.755
of someone driving 50 miles
an hour and late for work.

01:57.757 --> 01:59.573
Is there something going on
here, detectives?

01:59.575 --> 02:01.342
Just show us where
the other victim is.

02:01.344 --> 02:02.543
The woman
driving the SUV?

02:02.545 --> 02:03.961
Right this way.

02:06.098 --> 02:09.750
If you don't mind me asking, why
are two Major Case detectives

02:09.752 --> 02:11.519
at the scene of a car accident?

02:11.521 --> 02:13.420
We're crossing our fingers.

02:13.422 --> 02:14.388
Detectives?

02:14.390 --> 02:15.807
She the only
one in the car?

02:15.809 --> 02:16.757
That's right.

02:16.759 --> 02:18.693
Detective.
Can you open it up?

02:18.695 --> 02:20.728
(unzips)

02:24.766 --> 02:26.100
What's the
cause of death?

02:26.102 --> 02:27.318
That's a 50-foot drop.

02:27.320 --> 02:29.537
Yeah, I saw that.

02:36.712 --> 02:38.246
And that,

02:38.248 --> 02:41.632
that's where a .223 round
went through her skull.

02:41.634 --> 02:43.050
That's the cause of death.

02:46.889 --> 02:49.090
(elevator bell dings)

02:52.794 --> 02:54.979
Thanks, Abby.

02:58.400 --> 03:00.434
Beef up patrols
on all major highways?

03:00.436 --> 03:02.687
Put Highway Patrol
on 12-hour tours.

03:02.689 --> 03:03.971
Yes, sir.

03:03.973 --> 03:05.356
All right, people,
let's take it

03:05.358 --> 03:06.357
from the top.

03:06.359 --> 03:07.942
You know what
I'm about to say.

03:07.944 --> 03:09.911
I do.

03:09.913 --> 03:11.478
And you already
disagree with me.

03:11.480 --> 03:13.698
I enjoy watching
you make your case.

03:13.700 --> 03:15.750
We now have two people who have
been shot on our highways,

03:15.752 --> 03:18.619
Frank, a week apart
but from the same gun.

03:18.621 --> 03:20.671
Tell me something I don't know.
We need to hold a press conference.

03:20.673 --> 03:24.425
This is a serial sniper,
a highway hit man.

03:24.427 --> 03:26.544
Oh, you're already writing copy.

03:26.546 --> 03:27.678
I know what
you're going to say.

03:27.680 --> 03:29.146
If we go public, we're gonna
set off a panic.

03:29.148 --> 03:30.848
We could.
Frankly,

03:30.850 --> 03:32.884
I think a little panic
here is a good thing.

03:32.886 --> 03:34.302
Given the circumstances,

03:34.304 --> 03:36.103
why not have everyone on alert?

03:37.306 --> 03:38.556
Thin?

03:38.558 --> 03:40.174
Just a little.

03:40.176 --> 03:43.027
Frank, I may not be doing a very
good job articulating why,

03:43.029 --> 03:46.364
but I know in my bones we have
to tell the public about this.

03:46.366 --> 03:50.401
Because sometimes it's the 12th
man that wins the game for you.

03:50.403 --> 03:51.685
What?

03:51.687 --> 03:53.154
There are eight million people
in this city.

03:53.156 --> 03:56.741
That's 16 million eyeballs
out there looking for clues

03:56.743 --> 03:59.160
that can help us catch
this son of a bitch.

03:59.162 --> 04:01.229
You were going to hold
a press conference all along,

04:01.231 --> 04:02.213
weren't you?

04:02.215 --> 04:04.582
Shall we?

04:07.085 --> 04:10.504
SEAN:
May 24, 1883.

04:10.506 --> 04:11.589
That's exactly right.

04:11.591 --> 04:13.224
Which makes the
bridge how old?

04:13.226 --> 04:14.175
Um...

04:14.177 --> 04:16.644
NICKY:
129.

04:16.646 --> 04:19.981
That's right, so imagine that,
just think about it.

04:19.983 --> 04:22.850
In an age before computers
and heavy machinery,

04:22.852 --> 04:24.885
the men and women
of this city

04:24.887 --> 04:26.687
built the greatest
bridge ever

04:26.689 --> 04:29.357
with just their bare
hands and their hearts

04:29.359 --> 04:30.825
and minds.

04:30.827 --> 04:31.826
JACK:
That's cool,

04:31.828 --> 04:32.910
but why do
we need to know

04:32.912 --> 04:34.445
so much
about the Brooklyn Bridge?

04:34.447 --> 04:37.415
Because your great-great-
grandfather helped build it.

04:37.417 --> 04:38.399
He did?

04:38.401 --> 04:39.566
ERIN:
That's right,

04:39.568 --> 04:41.369
that's my mother's
dad's dad.

04:41.371 --> 04:42.620
Wow.
He was the first one

04:42.622 --> 04:44.755
of our family
to come to America.

04:44.757 --> 04:46.924
Yep, and when he laid
those limestone blocks

04:46.926 --> 04:49.260
down, he laid

04:49.262 --> 04:50.711
our roots with it.

04:50.713 --> 04:52.096
Our family has lasted
here in Brooklyn

04:52.098 --> 04:54.081
for as long
as that Great Bridge has.

04:54.083 --> 04:55.582
JACK: Wow.
That's cool, right?

04:55.584 --> 04:57.018
Yeah.

04:57.020 --> 04:58.352
Let's go.

05:04.092 --> 05:05.559
Whoa. Hey, watch it!
Watch it!

05:07.379 --> 05:08.362
Sean!

05:10.515 --> 05:13.284
Sean!

05:13.286 --> 05:14.402
MAN:
Oh, my gosh.

05:14.404 --> 05:15.353
Oh, my God.

05:15.355 --> 05:16.621
Sean, are you okay?

05:17.873 --> 05:20.408
Sean.
MAN: You need any help?

05:20.410 --> 05:21.742
WOMAN:
Run, get some help.

05:23.662 --> 05:25.997
Nicky, call 911.

05:28.216 --> 05:30.418
Oh, my gosh, Sean.

Why can't we just get him to a cab,
take him to the hospital ourselves?

No, we can't move him.

06:02.018 --> 06:03.268
Mom!
Look,

06:03.270 --> 06:05.052
I don't know what's wrong with
him; it might be his neck.

If we move him,
we could make it worse.

06:08.664 --> 06:10.265

we need to do something.

Excuse me.

06:12.529 --> 06:14.045
What do we got?

06:14.047 --> 06:14.962
It was a bike accident.

06:14.964 --> 06:17.115
He hit his head hard.

06:17.117 --> 06:18.566
He's been in and out
of consciousness.

06:18.568 --> 06:20.101
Okay, step back.
Okay.

06:28.110 --> 06:29.777
Is he going to be okay?

06:29.779 --> 06:32.113
Yeah, he's going
to be okay.

DANNY:
<i>All right,</i>

06:51.835 --> 06:53.551
these are
our two victims.

06:53.553 --> 06:55.169
First, Gerald Webber

06:55.171 --> 06:56.754
shot last week in Queens

06:56.756 --> 06:59.056
and Angela Miller shot
this morning in Brooklyn.

06:59.058 --> 07:01.476
And we're certain there's no
connection between the two?

07:01.478 --> 07:02.593
The only thing
they have in common

07:02.595 --> 07:04.128
is that they both get mail.

07:04.130 --> 07:06.514
Uh-huh, how about a link
between the locations?

07:06.516 --> 07:08.850
Two different boroughs
and two miles apart.

07:08.852 --> 07:11.802
That's right, but we may
have found something.

07:13.155 --> 07:15.356
Great, you're garbage
picking in my squad room.

07:15.358 --> 07:16.657
Just hear me out,
okay, Sarge?

07:16.659 --> 07:17.892
Uh-huh.

07:17.894 --> 07:19.911
You haven't gone down
one of these rabbit holes

07:19.913 --> 07:20.978
with Reagan yet, have you?

07:20.980 --> 07:21.996
Haven't had
the pleasure.

07:21.998 --> 07:23.498
Oh, and what a
pleasure it is.

07:23.500 --> 07:24.499
Look,

07:24.501 --> 07:25.616
are you ready or not?

07:25.618 --> 07:27.535
Born ready.

07:27.537 --> 07:29.403
Okay, here we go.

07:29.405 --> 07:30.705
We had the trash cans pulled

07:30.707 --> 07:33.040
from where CSU says
our guy took his shots, okay?

07:33.042 --> 07:34.125
Mm-hmm.

07:34.127 --> 07:35.459
Was thinking, you
know, maybe he throws

07:35.461 --> 07:37.261
his shell casings
in the trash or something.

07:37.263 --> 07:38.546
Right, and does he?

07:38.548 --> 07:39.997
No, he does not.

07:39.999 --> 07:42.099
So why am I standing
here, Reagan?

07:42.101 --> 07:44.835
You're standing here
for this, Sarge.

07:45.771 --> 07:47.805
Greener Grass Restaurant.

07:47.807 --> 07:49.173
Thanks, I already ate.

07:49.175 --> 07:50.274
You never heard
of it, have you?

07:50.276 --> 07:52.276
Do I look like I eat organic?

07:52.278 --> 07:53.644
And neither did I,
so we did

07:53.646 --> 07:55.563
a little checking,
and guess what--

07:55.565 --> 07:57.815
this, it turns out,
is a tiny, obscure,

07:57.817 --> 08:00.401
little health food spot
in the East Village.

08:00.403 --> 08:01.852
Okay.

08:01.854 --> 08:03.854
Well, we think this belongs
to our shooter.

08:03.856 --> 08:05.206
Ah.

08:05.208 --> 08:06.541
Is there a rifle in that bag?

08:06.543 --> 08:08.075
'Cause otherwise you're grasping
at straws, Reagan.

08:08.077 --> 08:10.194
A thousand different people
could have used that trash can.

08:10.196 --> 08:11.295
That's right,

08:11.297 --> 08:13.915
but how many people
could have got their lunch

08:13.917 --> 08:16.200
from this obscure little
health food spot

08:16.202 --> 08:17.385
in the East Village, then

08:17.387 --> 08:20.838
dumped their trash
in this bucket in Queens

08:20.840 --> 08:22.473
and also...

08:23.308 --> 08:27.144
...this one in Brooklyn?

08:32.818 --> 08:34.902
Son of a bitch
gets me every time.

08:34.904 --> 08:35.937
Thought he might.

08:35.938 --> 08:36.988
(phone rings)

08:36.990 --> 08:38.105
(sighs)

08:38.107 --> 08:39.273
Excuse me.

08:39.275 --> 08:41.107
Hey, sis, can this wait?

08:52.287 --> 08:54.422
So then I tell him, the
only way he's getting me

08:54.424 --> 08:57.258
in a bikini in November
is if he wears one, too.

08:57.260 --> 08:59.377
(laughs)
Right?

08:59.379 --> 09:01.796
Oh, come on, you don't
think that's funny?

09:01.798 --> 09:03.431
No, no, I think that's funny.

09:03.433 --> 09:04.432
That is funny.

09:04.434 --> 09:05.683
Well, you don't look so hot.

09:05.685 --> 09:06.851
Is everything okay?

09:06.853 --> 09:09.971
(phone rings)

09:11.857 --> 09:14.058
Hello.

09:17.095 --> 09:19.113
POOLE:
<i>Frank, I'm not saying no</i>

09:19.115 --> 09:22.617
to a press conference,
I'm saying let's wait.

09:22.619 --> 09:25.569
For what?

09:25.571 --> 09:27.538
Until we have more information.

09:27.540 --> 09:28.789
Information

09:28.791 --> 09:31.826
is exactly what we're hoping
to get more of, Mr. Mayor.

09:31.828 --> 09:33.044
Frank, not to mention

09:33.046 --> 09:35.997
a boatload of hysteria
during a busy holiday season.

09:35.999 --> 09:37.999
Holiday shopping
is not my concern.

09:38.001 --> 09:39.050
No, it's not,

09:39.052 --> 09:40.301
it's my concern,

09:40.303 --> 09:41.552
and on the brink
of the biggest season

09:41.554 --> 09:42.803
of the year,
you're going to bring about

09:42.805 --> 09:44.788
a public transportation overload

09:44.790 --> 09:46.474
and a retail sector meltdown.

09:46.476 --> 09:49.176
I am trying to stop
a serial killer, sir.

09:49.178 --> 09:51.429
And you will do just that,
Frank, I have no doubt.

09:53.315 --> 09:55.099
But you're gonna have to do it
without telling the world

09:55.101 --> 09:56.317
we have a serial sniper.

09:56.319 --> 09:58.019
(door opens)

09:58.021 --> 09:59.070
BAKER:
Commissioner,

09:59.072 --> 10:00.971
I need a moment.

10:06.361 --> 10:08.412
Excuse me.

10:19.958 --> 10:22.376
(slow, rhythmic beeping)

10:28.500 --> 10:30.051
DANNY:
Hey.

10:30.936 --> 10:32.520
Oh!

10:32.522 --> 10:34.855
(quietly):
It's okay.

10:34.857 --> 10:37.274
Hey.
I'm sorry, Danny.

10:38.477 --> 10:39.694
Hey.
Hi.

10:39.696 --> 10:41.062
Where's Linda?

10:42.564 --> 10:44.148
Hey.
Hey.

10:45.016 --> 10:46.233
Is he okay?

10:46.235 --> 10:47.702
I don't know.

10:47.704 --> 10:48.986
What do you mean
you don't know?

10:48.988 --> 10:50.538
Is our boy gonna be
all right or not?

10:50.540 --> 10:52.323
Danny, we got to talk
to the doctors, okay?

10:52.325 --> 10:54.375
All right?

10:54.377 --> 10:56.544
Just hold on, okay?

10:57.796 --> 10:59.964
How's our son?

10:59.966 --> 11:01.882
Sean has suffered
significant brain trauma,

11:01.884 --> 11:06.036
so unfortunately, that's produced
a diffuse cerebral edema.

11:06.038 --> 11:08.055
What does that mean
in English?

11:08.057 --> 11:11.175
Think about like the
whole brain is bruised.

11:11.177 --> 11:14.044
It's swelling and causing
increased pressure.

11:14.046 --> 11:15.647
What does that mean?
What are you saying?

11:15.648 --> 11:17.732
Is our son in a coma?
Does he have brain damage?

11:17.734 --> 11:20.151
What are you saying?
Right now he's in and out

11:20.153 --> 11:23.053
of consciousness, and we expect
he will be for some time.

11:23.055 --> 11:24.555
And as for any permanent damage,

11:24.557 --> 11:26.723
we won't know
until the swelling comes down.

11:26.725 --> 11:30.611
Doctor, are you doing anything
to reduce the swelling?

11:30.613 --> 11:31.579
We're not.

11:31.581 --> 11:33.730
Have you
considered steroids?

11:33.732 --> 11:36.117
I'm an RN at St. Victor's.
Oh.

11:36.119 --> 11:38.536
At this point, any attempt
at direct treatment

11:38.538 --> 11:40.504
could only make matters worse.

11:40.506 --> 11:42.139
So we just sit here?

11:42.141 --> 11:44.425
Well, in time
the swelling will go down

11:44.427 --> 11:48.379
on its own, and then we'll have
a better sense of how severe...

11:51.583 --> 11:54.468
Look... the
truth is,

11:54.470 --> 11:56.854
we don't know what
we're dealing with right now,

11:56.856 --> 11:59.940
and we won't
until we give it more time.

12:02.144 --> 12:03.394
How much time?

12:03.396 --> 12:05.112
We're about to do another MRI.

12:05.114 --> 12:06.897
That should give us
some information.

12:06.899 --> 12:09.033
How much time, Doctor?

12:09.035 --> 12:12.236
Through the night, at least.

12:12.238 --> 12:15.105
Maybe as much as a few days.

12:17.042 --> 12:17.992
Thank you.

12:17.994 --> 12:20.110
I'll check in
with you later.

12:20.112 --> 12:21.412
Be a minute.

12:21.414 --> 12:24.281
ERIN:
Jack, have a seat.

12:25.783 --> 12:27.835
♪

12:27.837 --> 12:29.837
How bad is it, babe?

12:31.890 --> 12:34.558
LINDA: You heard what they said--
they don't know.

12:34.560 --> 12:38.012
You know, the best thing
that we can do right now is...

12:38.014 --> 12:41.148
we should stay positive.

12:41.150 --> 12:42.900
What if the swelling
doesn't go down?

12:42.902 --> 12:45.769
Danny, we're not even gonna
think like that right now.

12:45.771 --> 12:47.137
Okay?

12:48.490 --> 12:50.958
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A. system)

12:50.960 --> 12:52.827
(sighs)

12:53.829 --> 12:55.479
It's gonna be a while

12:55.481 --> 12:57.314
before we know anything
definitive over here.

12:57.316 --> 12:59.166
Danny's gonna put on
a tough exterior,

12:59.168 --> 13:00.951
but look out for him, will you?

13:00.953 --> 13:02.786
We're on it, Dad.
How are you doing?

13:02.788 --> 13:04.171
(sighs):
Oh, I'm okay.

13:04.173 --> 13:06.090
We're pretty sure
it's the same guy.

13:06.092 --> 13:08.676
Both ballistics reports
confirm that he's using

13:08.678 --> 13:11.762
some kind of ammunition
with a lead substitute.

13:11.764 --> 13:13.681
Bismuth?

13:13.683 --> 13:15.966
Well, there you go--
40 grand a year at Harvard

13:15.968 --> 13:17.501
finally paid off.

13:18.687 --> 13:20.337
Frank?

13:20.339 --> 13:23.224
(sighs)
Look, Jamie, I got to go.

13:23.226 --> 13:24.775
I'm sorry.

13:24.777 --> 13:26.560
I'm just jammed up here.

13:26.562 --> 13:28.696
Tell Danny and Linda I called.

13:28.698 --> 13:30.013
Keep me posted.

13:30.015 --> 13:32.233
Right, Dad.

13:32.235 --> 13:33.701
Cheeseburger,
plain with lemonade,

13:33.703 --> 13:37.204
and I stopped by the house to
pick you up a change of clothes.

13:37.206 --> 13:39.406
An elderly man
was shot and killed

13:39.408 --> 13:43.127
on the Cross Bronx Expressway 40
minutes ago with the same gun.

13:43.129 --> 13:47.047
Okay. Tell the press I'll
be down to make a statement.

13:47.049 --> 13:49.884
You shouldn't do that.
This morning you told me I had to.

13:49.886 --> 13:51.418
That was before
the mayor said you can't.

13:51.420 --> 13:53.254
You're a man
of great courage, Garrett.

13:53.256 --> 13:54.471
I'm a man who knows

13:54.473 --> 13:56.924
when to cover <i>your</i> ass
as much as his own.

13:56.926 --> 13:58.058
That's why you pay me.

13:58.060 --> 13:59.843
Now, listen to me,
the mayor...

13:59.845 --> 14:02.546
The mayor...
isn't in charge here.

14:02.548 --> 14:04.064
I am.

14:20.805 --> 14:23.106
Frank, I told you I wasn't
ready to go public with this,

14:23.108 --> 14:24.974
yet you went ahead anyway.

14:25.131 --> 14:26.358
You're welcome.

14:26.359 --> 14:27.491
I beg your pardon?

14:27.493 --> 14:28.759
Now you don't have to explain

14:28.761 --> 14:30.544
why the public
wasn't informed sooner.

14:30.546 --> 14:32.313
I see-- so I
should thank you?

14:32.315 --> 14:34.231
I would prefer that
you let me conduct

14:34.233 --> 14:36.800
this investigation as I see fit.
In other words,

14:36.802 --> 14:37.935
stay out of your way?

14:37.937 --> 14:39.536
Mr. Mayor...
Commissioner,

14:39.538 --> 14:41.772
you violated a direct order.

14:41.774 --> 14:43.774
I serve at your pleasure, sir--

14:43.776 --> 14:46.160
I don't take orders from anyone.

14:46.162 --> 14:48.645
(sighs)

14:49.981 --> 14:51.582
Frank, you and I

14:51.584 --> 14:54.034
have danced around this
in the past.

14:54.036 --> 14:56.036
Now, how
many times

14:56.038 --> 14:58.589
do you think you can draw
a line in the sand

14:58.591 --> 14:59.923
before I dare to cross it?

14:59.925 --> 15:02.543
I took an oath
to protect this city.

15:02.545 --> 15:06.997
Any lines drawn are out of
a commitment to honor that oath.

15:08.433 --> 15:11.051
Frank, you are right
about one thing--

15:11.053 --> 15:13.387
you do serve at my pleasure.

15:14.472 --> 15:17.474
And lately, it has not been
much of a pleasure.

15:19.510 --> 15:21.228
That's all, Commissioner.

15:23.681 --> 15:25.149
Look, I know
this is difficult,

15:25.151 --> 15:27.451
but we just don't have
enough information at this time.

15:27.453 --> 15:30.371
LINDA: Can you give us an idea
of when you may have more?

15:30.373 --> 15:33.073
(phone rings)

15:33.075 --> 15:34.691
Hey. Anything?

15:34.693 --> 15:36.460
KATE: I'm at Greener Grass,
following up

15:36.462 --> 15:38.328
on those takeout bags you found.

15:38.330 --> 15:40.080
No surveillance cameras,
no credit card receipts--

15:40.082 --> 15:41.148
it's a dead end.

15:41.150 --> 15:43.033
Okay, is there anyone
who works there

15:43.035 --> 15:44.534
who can identify him?

15:44.536 --> 15:46.536
Off of what, two half-eaten
black-bean wraps?

15:46.538 --> 15:47.971
That's their most popular item.

15:47.973 --> 15:49.223
(sighs):
All right, all right,

15:49.225 --> 15:51.308
look, just keep me
in the loop, okay?

15:51.310 --> 15:53.877
I'm gonna have to take
some personal time, Kate, so...

15:53.879 --> 15:55.929
Right. Of course.

15:55.931 --> 15:58.982
Danny... how is your son doing?

15:58.984 --> 16:02.653
Fine. Look, just check in
if you hear anything, okay?

16:02.655 --> 16:04.721
Of course.
We're all praying for you.

16:04.723 --> 16:06.774
Yeah. Thank you.

16:06.776 --> 16:09.526
You didn't have to do that.
Yes, I did.

16:09.528 --> 16:11.111
What did the
doctor say?

16:11.113 --> 16:13.330
She said...
no change, you know?

16:13.332 --> 16:16.200
It's been 24 hours--
what does she mean, no change?

16:16.202 --> 16:18.202
Didn't she say, 24 hours, we
would know something, Linda?

16:18.204 --> 16:19.736
It's been 24 hours--
we know nothing.

16:19.738 --> 16:21.071
Our son is still
laying there.

16:21.073 --> 16:23.340
I know, but, Danny,
y-you have to understand,

16:23.342 --> 16:25.092
this happens sometimes, okay?

16:25.094 --> 16:27.127
Sometimes the contusion

16:27.129 --> 16:31.432
is so severe that the nerves,
they get sheared.

16:31.434 --> 16:32.599
What does that mean?

16:32.601 --> 16:33.967
Uh...
What does it mean

16:33.969 --> 16:35.269
that the nerves "get sheared"?

16:35.271 --> 16:37.855
Can someone speak English
to me around here?

16:37.857 --> 16:41.758
You know what, honey, m-maybe...

16:41.760 --> 16:45.929
maybe it's best if you just go
work on the case a little bit.

16:50.235 --> 16:52.786
♪

17:08.136 --> 17:10.954
I don't know what to say to him.

17:10.955 --> 17:12.172
There's nothing
to say.

17:12.174 --> 17:13.473
Well, what do we do?

17:15.626 --> 17:17.928
Are you feeling guilty?

17:17.930 --> 17:20.681
It happened
on my watch, Grandpa.

17:20.683 --> 17:21.932
Thank God it did.

17:21.934 --> 17:24.151
You may have saved
that boy's life, you know.

17:24.153 --> 17:26.487
I don't know about that.

17:29.473 --> 17:31.909
You think Danny
will ever forgive me?

17:31.911 --> 17:34.695
Anything less than a thank-you
from Danny Reagan,

17:34.697 --> 17:37.247
I will personally
knock him on his behind.

17:37.249 --> 17:40.650
You have always been my knight
in shining armor, Grandpa.

17:40.652 --> 17:42.286
(chuckles)

17:42.288 --> 17:43.620
(clears throat softly)

17:43.622 --> 17:45.255
I am worried about Danny.

17:45.257 --> 17:46.840
You think he'll be okay?

17:46.842 --> 17:48.825
Danny can do anything.

17:48.827 --> 17:52.379
Except nothing.

17:52.381 --> 17:54.497
Well, you may be right
about that.

17:54.499 --> 17:55.832
(clears throat)

17:55.834 --> 17:57.935
Just like his old man, that one.

17:57.937 --> 17:59.720
Yeah, and Dad's
got his hands full.

17:59.722 --> 18:01.004
Yeah, but
right now

18:01.006 --> 18:03.273
the only thing churning
around in his mind

18:03.275 --> 18:06.810
is this concern over Sean,
Danny and Linda.

18:06.812 --> 18:10.564
And memories of Joe.

18:10.566 --> 18:12.149
Ah.

18:13.201 --> 18:15.619
Losing Joe pushes buttons
in all of us

18:15.621 --> 18:17.538
at a time like this.

18:19.707 --> 18:23.493
But your dad carries
an extra burden.

18:23.495 --> 18:25.528
In his mind...

18:25.530 --> 18:27.915
he ordered his son
into harm's way,

18:27.917 --> 18:29.883
and he didn't come home.

18:31.236 --> 18:34.221
It happened on his watch.

18:38.593 --> 18:41.595
I'm gonna get back
to the hospital.

18:41.597 --> 18:44.398
Okay.

18:44.400 --> 18:47.050
I'll take the evening shift.

18:53.741 --> 18:56.276
Does this thing work?

19:02.951 --> 19:07.421
Careful-- more people die
from soda machines than shark attacks.

19:07.423 --> 19:08.905
Hey.

19:08.907 --> 19:10.257
Hey.

19:10.259 --> 19:12.242
How you doing?

19:12.244 --> 19:14.411
Me, I'm fine.
How you doing?

19:15.546 --> 19:17.948
Linda says you're gonna
take some personal time.

19:17.950 --> 19:19.516
Let me guess--

19:19.518 --> 19:21.501
you think it's a bad idea, too.

19:21.503 --> 19:24.238
It depends. Is this what you're
gonna do with your free time?

19:24.240 --> 19:26.773
Come on, you know if it
was Nicky in that bed,

19:26.775 --> 19:29.393
we wouldn't be able to pry
you away from her side.

19:29.395 --> 19:32.779
Probably. But I don't
hunt serial killers for a living.

19:32.781 --> 19:35.932
I'm sure Dad's got 50 detectives
on the case by now.

19:35.934 --> 19:39.453
Let's hope one of them
is half as good as you.

19:40.321 --> 19:42.155
I'm serious.

19:45.276 --> 19:46.943
I meant to say

19:46.945 --> 19:49.612
something to you earlier.

19:49.614 --> 19:52.449
I'm glad it was you
that was with Sean.

19:54.919 --> 19:57.638
I wish I could've done
something more, Danny.

19:57.640 --> 19:59.673
No. If he makes it through this,

19:59.675 --> 20:02.759
it's <i>because</i> you were there
and you acted so quickly.

20:02.761 --> 20:03.960
He will get through it.

20:03.962 --> 20:05.295
You don't know that.

20:06.297 --> 20:07.931
No, but I believe it.

20:07.933 --> 20:10.517
And sometimes that's
more powerful than knowing it.

20:10.519 --> 20:11.968
(sighs)

20:11.970 --> 20:13.854
You sound like Mom.

20:13.856 --> 20:16.023
Blind faith.

20:16.025 --> 20:18.825
There's nothing blind about it.

20:20.111 --> 20:21.828
What?

20:21.830 --> 20:24.014
You really still believe,
don't you?

20:24.016 --> 20:27.951
I couldn't do what I do
every day if I didn't,

20:27.953 --> 20:29.670
and neither could you.

20:29.672 --> 20:31.588
I don't know about that.

20:31.590 --> 20:34.257
All those years
of Catholic school.

20:34.259 --> 20:37.010
All those Sundays going to Mass.

20:37.012 --> 20:39.846
I was just going
through the motions.

20:42.350 --> 20:45.302
Whatever faith I had
slipped away from me

20:45.304 --> 20:47.170
a long time ago
when I wasn't looking,

20:47.172 --> 20:48.505
and it's gone, sis.

20:48.507 --> 20:49.973
It's not gone.

20:49.975 --> 20:52.526
It's just buried under a lot
of mutts and mopes.

20:52.528 --> 20:53.894
That's all.

20:53.896 --> 20:56.229
That's all.

20:58.015 --> 20:59.199
Hey. Hey, Danny.

20:59.201 --> 21:00.400
Yeah.
Got a minute?

21:00.402 --> 21:01.568
Yeah.

21:01.570 --> 21:03.036
Bring that coffee
to your mom, okay?

21:03.038 --> 21:04.121
Okay.
Be right there.

21:04.123 --> 21:05.322
What's up?

21:05.324 --> 21:07.190
Dad told me about the
unusual ballistics report.

21:07.192 --> 21:09.292
Yeah, rounds were made
of bismuth or something.

21:09.294 --> 21:10.744
Yeah, an element.

21:10.746 --> 21:12.455
It's got a lot of the
same properties as lead.

21:12.480 --> 21:13.131
Yeah, right.

21:13.132 --> 21:14.864
But it's much more
environmentally friendly.

21:14.866 --> 21:16.500
What are you talking about?
Like, green ammo?

21:16.502 --> 21:18.368
Exactly. Yeah, we used
to go to the range

21:18.370 --> 21:20.087
with a guy who would
shoot with the stuff.

21:20.089 --> 21:20.526
Right.

21:20.551 --> 21:21.506
I thought they just
made shotgun rounds,

21:21.507 --> 21:22.889
but when my buddy
put me in contact

21:22.891 --> 21:24.174
with the president
of the company,

21:24.176 --> 21:25.592
he told me something that
might help your case.

21:25.594 --> 21:27.010
You're going to tell me
they made rifle ammo?

21:27.012 --> 21:28.395
Some experimental stock.

21:28.397 --> 21:31.214
And get this-- in .223 caliber.

21:31.216 --> 21:32.265
Just like the shooter.

21:32.267 --> 21:33.817
Company just went
out of business.

21:33.819 --> 21:35.268
Had a big fire sale.

21:35.270 --> 21:37.604
This guy bought a
ton of their stuff.

21:37.606 --> 21:39.189
Peter Westlake.

21:39.191 --> 21:40.774
Good work, kid.

21:49.867 --> 21:52.753
I think I got
to go, babe.

21:52.755 --> 21:55.172
I know.

22:00.511 --> 22:02.846
It's okay, Danny.

22:02.848 --> 22:04.881
There's not much
you can do here

22:04.883 --> 22:07.417
rather than drive
yourself crazy anyway.

22:07.419 --> 22:09.603
Yeah.

22:15.643 --> 22:17.110
Hey.

22:17.112 --> 22:18.728
I need you
to be brave, okay?

22:18.730 --> 22:20.096
You take care
of your mother

22:20.098 --> 22:21.431
and your brother,
all right?

22:21.433 --> 22:22.932
Yes, Dad.

22:22.934 --> 22:25.101
All right, buddy.

22:26.737 --> 22:28.938
Don't you go
anywhere, baby boy.

22:28.940 --> 22:31.107
I'll be right back.

22:35.496 --> 22:37.914
I love you.

22:37.916 --> 22:39.616
Take care of our baby.

22:39.618 --> 22:41.784
I will.

22:51.629 --> 22:54.181
(indistinct shouting)

22:54.183 --> 22:56.299
Put your hands
behind your back!

22:56.301 --> 22:57.517
What the hell is going on?

22:57.519 --> 22:59.319
Are you Peter Westlake?

22:59.321 --> 23:00.770
Yes.

23:00.772 --> 23:02.906
You got a bunch of green bullets?
I can explain...

23:02.908 --> 23:04.741
Yes or no?!
Yes. Yes.

23:04.743 --> 23:05.692
Why? Why'd you do that?

23:05.694 --> 23:07.327
For that.

23:14.702 --> 23:16.036
What the hell is that?

23:16.038 --> 23:18.588
It's... art.

23:33.496 --> 23:34.748
KATE: Sorry for your
trouble, sir.

23:34.749 --> 23:35.998
Ah, don't be.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.066
You've given me
my next piece.

23:38.068 --> 23:40.252
Early Pollock?

23:51.247 --> 23:53.098
A dollar for your thoughts?

23:54.801 --> 23:56.251
(sighs)

23:56.253 --> 23:57.853
We're missing something.

23:57.855 --> 23:59.588
We're not seeing it.

23:59.590 --> 24:01.440
I mean, we got a black man
in Queens,

24:01.442 --> 24:03.859
a young woman in Brooklyn,
an elderly man in the Bronx,

24:03.861 --> 24:05.528
but something doesn't add up.

24:05.530 --> 24:06.862
What?

24:06.864 --> 24:08.147
I don't know.

24:08.149 --> 24:10.265
I mean, we got stuff that
connects the shooter, right?

24:10.267 --> 24:12.151
We got the trash
from the health food store,

24:12.153 --> 24:13.369
we got the green bullets,

24:13.371 --> 24:14.954
but we got nothing
connecting these victims.

24:14.956 --> 24:17.540
So, what do you think,
that these are random?

24:17.542 --> 24:18.941
No. No, no, no, no.

24:18.943 --> 24:21.660
This shooter, he's choosing
these people for a reason.

24:21.662 --> 24:23.879
So, what's the connection?

24:25.549 --> 24:27.750
We got it, Sarge.
It's their cars.

24:27.752 --> 24:30.085
Huh?
Victim one drove a Challenger.

24:30.087 --> 24:32.838
Victim two an Excursion.

24:32.840 --> 24:35.174
Victim three a 911.

24:35.176 --> 24:36.458
I don't see it.

24:36.460 --> 24:38.594
All three of these vehicles
have one thing in common.

24:38.596 --> 24:40.128
They're all gas guzzlers.

24:41.130 --> 24:43.632
Well, I get the SUV,
but the others?

24:43.634 --> 24:46.185
Yeah, but all three of them
fall under the gas guzzler tax.

24:46.187 --> 24:47.486
Which is?

24:47.488 --> 24:49.572
A law that says
that any car that fails

24:49.574 --> 24:52.641
to meet fuel economy standards
will pay a penalty tax.

24:52.643 --> 24:54.026
DANNY:
Sarge, this guy

24:54.028 --> 24:56.278
is eating organic food,
he's using green ammo

24:56.280 --> 24:57.997
and he's targeting gas guzzlers.

24:57.999 --> 25:00.533
An environmental extremist?

25:00.535 --> 25:02.368
Yes, our shooter's trying
to save the environment

25:02.370 --> 25:05.504
one dead motorist at a time.

25:05.506 --> 25:07.990
So, we'll get going on
all the hard-core green groups.

25:07.992 --> 25:09.658
In this city,
there's got to be at least 50.

25:09.660 --> 25:12.177
We'll start
with the federal watch list.

25:12.179 --> 25:14.663
All right, go.

25:25.609 --> 25:27.643
That may be true,
Mr. Leaf.

25:27.645 --> 25:29.612
You're the only green
group with a stated goal

25:29.614 --> 25:31.146
of obliterating
the human race.

25:31.148 --> 25:33.699
That is not meant
to be taken literally.

25:33.701 --> 25:35.017
Really?

25:35.019 --> 25:36.201
Then why does it say,

25:36.203 --> 25:37.736
"The only way
to save Mother Earth

25:37.738 --> 25:40.072
is to eradicate the human race
from existence"?

25:40.074 --> 25:42.124
Detective, you wanted
to know where I was yesterday

25:42.126 --> 25:43.742
and the day before;
I told you.

25:43.744 --> 25:45.244
My staff confirmed it.

25:45.246 --> 25:47.580
Now, please leave.

25:48.548 --> 25:50.165
Hold on. Mr. Leaf.

25:50.167 --> 25:53.502
You know, if you want to deal
with this down at the precinct,

25:53.504 --> 25:55.137
I can make that happen for you.

25:55.139 --> 25:57.673
I told you everything I know,
which is nothing.

25:57.675 --> 25:59.558
Now, what do you want?

25:59.560 --> 26:01.560
I want to know who's going
around killing innocent people,

26:01.562 --> 26:04.063
and I think you can help me
find out who did it.

26:04.065 --> 26:05.514
Innocent?
That's right.

26:05.516 --> 26:07.766
There is nothing innocent
about what we do to this planet.

26:07.768 --> 26:10.569
Now, if somebody wanted
to do something about that,

26:10.571 --> 26:12.321
well, then,
I applaud their courage.

26:12.323 --> 26:13.572
So you condone this behavior?

26:13.574 --> 26:15.240
If somebody broke
into your house

26:15.242 --> 26:17.559
and set it on fire,
wouldn't you have the right,

26:17.561 --> 26:19.495
under the law,
to kill that person?

26:19.497 --> 26:21.830
That is not the same thing
as taking an innocent life.

26:21.832 --> 26:24.950
It is if you consider
the Earth your true home.

26:24.952 --> 26:26.502
You know what?

26:26.504 --> 26:28.837
Maybe I do see your point.

26:28.839 --> 26:30.856
Maybe you're right. Maybe...
Hey, hey.

26:30.858 --> 26:33.408
Get your hands off me.
What the hell are you doing?!

26:33.410 --> 26:35.427
Get your hands off
me right now.

26:35.429 --> 26:37.096
Maybe you're right.

26:37.098 --> 26:39.581
Maybe we are the problem, and
maybe we can help you fix it.

26:39.583 --> 26:40.633
By starting with you.

26:40.635 --> 26:41.600
Hey, what the hell
are you doing?

26:41.602 --> 26:43.185
I'm donating to the cause.

26:43.187 --> 26:44.386
I don't know anything.

26:44.388 --> 26:45.888
I think you do. I think you do,

26:45.890 --> 26:47.422
and you better start
talking right now

26:47.424 --> 26:48.757
before I put my carbon footprint

26:48.759 --> 26:51.293
down your ugly...
Okay! Okay!

26:51.295 --> 26:53.195
Okay, I'll tell you!

26:53.197 --> 26:54.863
Start talking.

26:58.618 --> 26:59.318
Now!

26:59.320 --> 27:01.570
I met... this guy...

27:01.572 --> 27:03.622
at a rally.

27:03.624 --> 27:05.624
He was a...

27:05.626 --> 27:07.826
a former military guy.

27:08.828 --> 27:10.579
He was talking about doing
something like this,

27:10.581 --> 27:11.964
but he wanted to go big,

27:11.966 --> 27:13.782
asked if me and my group
would help him.

27:13.784 --> 27:15.334
And you don't say anything
to anyone?

27:15.336 --> 27:17.086
You don't call the cops?
LEAF: I thought he was crazy.

27:17.088 --> 27:18.971
I never believed he was
actually gonna do it.

27:18.973 --> 27:20.472
What's his name?
I don't know!

27:20.474 --> 27:22.007
Like I said,
he was just some guy

27:22.009 --> 27:23.092
at a rally.

27:23.094 --> 27:24.560
Did you take any pictures
at this rally?

27:24.562 --> 27:26.762
Uh, yeah.

27:27.814 --> 27:28.981
Yeah.

27:28.983 --> 27:31.517
Yeah, I think I did.

27:31.519 --> 27:34.302
KATE: Do you have one
where we can see his face?

27:34.304 --> 27:36.488
(breathes unsteadily)

27:49.152 --> 27:51.837
Kate. Look,
if I got a little

27:51.839 --> 27:53.455
over-the-top in there
and it made you uncomfortable,

27:53.457 --> 27:54.540
I apologize.

27:54.542 --> 27:56.491
You got nothing
to apologize to me for.

27:56.493 --> 27:57.993
Okay.

27:57.995 --> 27:59.678
We got what we came for,
didn't we?

27:59.680 --> 28:00.829
Let's hope so.

28:00.831 --> 28:02.681
Hey, listen, Danny.

28:03.516 --> 28:05.184
I'm all caught up
on my cases,

28:05.186 --> 28:07.352
I got nothing going on
the next couple of days.

28:07.354 --> 28:08.520
I'm happy to go overtime,

28:08.522 --> 28:10.022
take the load off of you.
That's okay.

28:10.024 --> 28:11.190
That's okay.

28:11.192 --> 28:13.008
I can't even begin to understand

28:13.010 --> 28:14.193
what you're going through.

28:14.195 --> 28:16.562
But the option is there
if you want it.

28:17.397 --> 28:20.365
I appreciate it, Kate.

28:21.735 --> 28:23.569
Okay.

28:23.571 --> 28:25.687
Let's get back to work.

28:25.689 --> 28:27.206
We're just a few blocks
from the health food place.

28:27.208 --> 28:29.575
Let's see if anybody around
there recognizes the face

28:29.577 --> 28:31.043
from the picture
Leaf just gave us.

28:31.045 --> 28:33.579
Good idea.

28:35.215 --> 28:37.132
DANNY:
Look, do you know the guy

28:37.134 --> 28:38.417
or not?

28:38.419 --> 28:41.053
Sorry, man. Can't say that I do.

28:41.055 --> 28:43.806
We think he comes in here,
orders a black bean burrito.

28:43.808 --> 28:45.424
Excellent choice.

28:45.426 --> 28:46.725
You being funny?

28:46.727 --> 28:47.810
'Cause I really

28:47.812 --> 28:49.728
lost my sense of humor
this week.

28:49.730 --> 28:51.230
No, dude. Just saying.

28:51.232 --> 28:54.099
It's not "dude,"
it's "Detective."

28:54.101 --> 28:56.485
(stutters)

28:57.821 --> 28:59.154
Take another look
and see

28:59.156 --> 29:01.490
if you can get over
your short-term memory loss.

29:02.325 --> 29:03.909
Sorry, dude...

29:04.744 --> 29:06.278
Detective, I...

29:07.247 --> 29:08.997
I-I don't... I don't
know the dude.

29:13.069 --> 29:14.119
Thanks for your time.

29:14.121 --> 29:15.570
No problemo.

29:15.572 --> 29:17.389
Didn't Leaf say he
was former military?

29:17.391 --> 29:18.857
Would explain his skill
with a rifle.

29:18.859 --> 29:20.859
Let's run the photo through
the Defense Department database.

29:20.861 --> 29:22.678
See what pops.

29:28.101 --> 29:30.102
The doctors aren't really sure
what he can hear

29:30.104 --> 29:32.187
in this condition.

29:32.189 --> 29:34.089
But we're gonna say

29:34.091 --> 29:36.141
our nighttime prayers.

29:36.143 --> 29:38.143
Hey, all right, could you put it
on speaker for me?

29:38.145 --> 29:40.262
Yeah.

29:40.264 --> 29:42.464
(rhythmic beeping)

29:44.267 --> 29:46.935
LINDA and JACK:
Now I lay me down to sleep,

29:46.937 --> 29:49.538
I pray the Lord my soul to keep,

29:49.540 --> 29:51.940
Thy angels watch me
through the night,

29:51.942 --> 29:54.626
And keep me safe
till morning light.

29:56.796 --> 29:58.297
Uh-huh.

29:59.215 --> 30:00.448
Thank you.

30:00.450 --> 30:03.451
It's coming through right now.

30:06.506 --> 30:08.473
(whirring)

30:11.261 --> 30:13.545
LINDA:
Now I lay me down to sleep.

30:13.547 --> 30:16.181
LINDA and JACK:
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

30:16.183 --> 30:19.434
If I should die before I wake,

30:19.436 --> 30:22.654
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

30:25.141 --> 30:27.860
(rhythmic beeping)

30:27.862 --> 30:29.828
KATE:
Hey, Danny.

30:29.830 --> 30:33.498
Uh, I'm gonna have to,
uh, run, okay?

30:33.500 --> 30:36.618
The Department of Defense came
back with a hit on our guy.

30:36.620 --> 30:39.338
I'll call you guys
as soon as I can.

30:39.340 --> 30:42.591
I love you. Bye.

30:44.827 --> 30:45.827
Got a name.

30:45.829 --> 30:46.879
Matt Hinkle.

30:46.881 --> 30:49.598
Matt Hinkle,
138 Downing Street.

30:49.600 --> 30:52.500
Okay. Let's roll.

31:01.027 --> 31:02.394
Matt Hinkle?!

31:02.396 --> 31:04.196
Police! Open up.

31:06.649 --> 31:09.284
This is us, let's go.

31:11.821 --> 31:12.738
Go! Go!

31:15.158 --> 31:16.458
Go!

31:25.001 --> 31:27.636
We finally get to him...

31:27.638 --> 31:29.755
And he blows
his brains out.

31:29.757 --> 31:32.724
(sighs)

31:42.181 --> 31:43.981
Remington 700 bolt action.

31:43.983 --> 31:45.783
That's the gun
the shooter used.

31:45.785 --> 31:48.519
Yeah, it is, but he kills
himself with a nine millimeter.

31:48.521 --> 31:50.354
Thank you.

31:50.356 --> 31:53.107
(sighs)

31:53.109 --> 31:55.109
You ever won the lottery, Kate?

31:55.111 --> 31:56.244
Do you think I'd still be here?

31:56.246 --> 31:57.828
I'm just saying,
what are the odds

31:57.830 --> 32:00.198
this guy blows himself away
right before we show up?

32:00.200 --> 32:02.700
(indistinct chatter)

32:02.702 --> 32:04.368
You think he knew
we were coming?

32:04.370 --> 32:06.003
One person knew.

32:06.005 --> 32:07.872
Our friend
at the green group,

32:07.874 --> 32:09.990
Mr. Leaf, called
and gave him a heads up?

32:14.329 --> 32:17.098
What if it wasn't a suicide?

32:17.100 --> 32:19.183
Open that.

32:21.336 --> 32:23.671
That military report say
he was a righty or a lefty?

32:27.175 --> 32:29.060
Left-handed.

32:29.062 --> 32:32.079
(sighs) Then why'd he shoot himself
with his right hand?

32:32.081 --> 32:34.081
Leaf killed him?

32:34.083 --> 32:36.550
Son of a bitch.
He puts us on his trail,

32:36.552 --> 32:38.519
buys himself enough time
to get over here,

32:38.521 --> 32:41.322
end this thing with one shot,
leave that rifle, case closed.

32:41.324 --> 32:42.657
Let's go.

32:47.579 --> 32:49.580
DANNY:
Richard Leaf?!

32:49.582 --> 32:52.083
Hey! Hey!

32:52.085 --> 32:53.968
Hey!

32:53.970 --> 32:56.003
Police! Hold it!

33:00.225 --> 33:01.208
Hey!

33:08.233 --> 33:11.068
(tires squeak)

33:11.070 --> 33:13.053
Here you go.

33:13.055 --> 33:14.555
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
Shut up.

33:14.557 --> 33:16.240
I wouldn't waste
a bullet on you.

33:16.242 --> 33:17.742
(groaning)

33:17.744 --> 33:20.494
A generation from now,
I'll be a hero.

33:20.496 --> 33:22.747
Well, for now, you're just
gonna be a convict.

33:22.749 --> 33:23.614
(groaning)

33:23.616 --> 33:24.865
Oh, looks like he broke his leg.

33:24.867 --> 33:27.918
(groaning)

33:27.920 --> 33:31.289
You know, it's kind of ironic,
it was an SUV took you out.

33:31.291 --> 33:33.240
I'll call a bus.

33:33.242 --> 33:34.925
Make it a hybrid, okay?

33:34.927 --> 33:36.210
(laughs)

33:36.212 --> 33:39.547
(panting)

33:42.917 --> 33:44.051
I will get started on that,

33:44.053 --> 33:45.686
and I'll have all of this
out of here shortly.

33:45.688 --> 33:48.306
Thank you. And I want
to write personal letters

33:48.308 --> 33:50.257
to the victims' families.

33:50.259 --> 33:51.609
Of course.

33:51.611 --> 33:53.394
(knocking)

33:55.147 --> 33:56.930
Frank.

33:56.932 --> 33:59.266
Mr. Mayor.
Excuse me.

34:04.439 --> 34:05.740
(door closes)

34:05.742 --> 34:07.708
Frank, I wanted
to come down here personally

34:07.710 --> 34:09.943
and tell you
how very proud you made us.

34:09.945 --> 34:14.947
Sir, you didn't come all the way
down here to tell me that.

34:18.303 --> 34:21.121
I came down to tell you
that I'm sorry, Frank.

34:21.123 --> 34:22.922
For what?

34:22.925 --> 34:25.926
Well, I've been rough
on you lately.

34:25.928 --> 34:28.679
I didn't know your grandson was
in the hospital.

34:30.599 --> 34:32.132
How is he?

34:32.134 --> 34:34.185
(sighs)

34:34.187 --> 34:36.969
I'm afraid we're not out
of the woods yet.

34:36.972 --> 34:39.607
Well, my family and I
are praying for you and yours.

34:39.609 --> 34:41.475
I appreciate that.

34:41.476 --> 34:43.143
Anything you need.

34:43.145 --> 34:44.578
Thank you, sir.

34:44.580 --> 34:45.862
And Frank,

34:45.864 --> 34:47.915
you made it clear that
you don't like to take orders,

34:47.917 --> 34:50.618
but I'm going to insist that you
follow this one to the letter.

34:51.985 --> 34:54.371
Go be with your family.

34:55.257 --> 34:57.425
(sighs)

34:59.211 --> 35:01.545
All living things
look to you, O Lord,

35:01.547 --> 35:03.931
to give them their food
in due season.

35:03.933 --> 35:06.834
You open your hand,
they have their fill.

35:06.836 --> 35:11.305
ALL: Glory to the Father and to
the Son and to the Holy Spirit.

35:11.307 --> 35:13.891
As it was in the beginning,

35:13.893 --> 35:18.312
is now, and ever shall be,
world without end. Amen.

35:55.183 --> 35:58.185
(rhythmic beeping)

35:59.888 --> 36:01.856
You know, the doctors--

36:01.858 --> 36:05.225
they want us
to keep talking to you.

36:05.227 --> 36:09.747
They're not sure
if you can hear us.

36:09.749 --> 36:13.584
Just like your old man.

36:15.170 --> 36:17.087
You're also unpredictable,

36:17.089 --> 36:19.406
and you'll do anything
and say anything,

36:19.408 --> 36:21.592
like your old man.

36:21.594 --> 36:23.160
And you drive

36:23.162 --> 36:25.245
your mother crazy,
just like I did,

36:25.247 --> 36:27.414
Uncle Jamie and Uncle...

36:39.427 --> 36:41.612
Hey, Joe...

36:43.899 --> 36:46.650
If there's a version
of this where you're up there,

36:46.652 --> 36:49.620
and you can actually hear me...

36:53.575 --> 36:56.210
...maybe you could knock
on somebody's door?

36:57.779 --> 36:59.780
Put in a good word?

36:59.782 --> 37:01.966
(rhythmic beeping)

37:04.953 --> 37:07.788
(breath quivering)

37:27.576 --> 37:29.827
(sighs)

37:48.880 --> 37:51.048
(sighs)

38:04.496 --> 38:06.814
(sighs)

38:24.382 --> 38:26.584
(groaning)

38:33.758 --> 38:35.259
Hey, buddy.

38:35.261 --> 38:37.011
Daddy.

38:37.013 --> 38:39.713
Hey, can you hear me?

38:39.715 --> 38:41.599
I can hear you, Daddy.

38:41.601 --> 38:43.050
Yeah?

38:45.070 --> 38:47.104
Okay. Tell me your name.

38:47.106 --> 38:49.023
Sean.

38:49.025 --> 38:51.609
Yeah? That's all right. Hey.

38:53.445 --> 38:55.228
Mommy.

38:59.334 --> 39:01.535
Sean.

39:11.579 --> 39:13.764
(sighs)

39:32.867 --> 39:35.102
(sighs)

39:37.956 --> 39:40.240
Thanks, kiddo.
