00:23.774 --> 00:25.014
<i>When I think of my wife...</i>

00:27.194 --> 00:29.697
<i>...I always think
of her head.</i>

00:31.156 --> 00:33.955
<i>I picture cracking
her lovely skull...</i>

00:34.117 --> 00:36.245
<i>unspooling her brains...</i>

00:36.411 --> 00:39.039
<i>trying to get answers.</i>

00:40.249 --> 00:43.628
<i>The primal questions
of any marriage.</i>

00:43.794 --> 00:46.013
<i>"What are you thinking?"</i>

00:46.171 --> 00:48.299
<i>"How are you feeling?"</i>

00:48.465 --> 00:51.093
<i>"What have we done
to each other?"</i>

02:26.897 --> 02:30.071
The Irish prince graces us
with his presence.

02:31.735 --> 02:34.864
His majesty prefers
not to be moistened.

02:36.073 --> 02:37.370
I got you a present.

02:37.574 --> 02:38.746
Oh.

02:38.950 --> 02:40.350
- I hated this game.
- You loved it.

02:40.452 --> 02:41.624
You loved it.

02:41.787 --> 02:44.085
Thank you. I'll add
it to the collection.

02:44.873 --> 02:47.046
Can you pour
me a bourbon?

02:53.298 --> 02:55.392
What's up, Jitters?

02:59.096 --> 03:00.188
Well, if you're
not going to talk...

03:00.263 --> 03:01.310
I'm gonna have to
fill the silence...

03:01.473 --> 03:04.727
with another excruciating
story by Margo Dunne.

03:04.893 --> 03:07.442
I could tell you about my recent
customer service experience...

03:07.604 --> 03:09.481
- changing Internet service providers.
- I like that one.

03:09.648 --> 03:10.649
Or how about the time...

03:10.732 --> 03:12.405
I saw that woman who looked
exactly like my friend Monica?

03:12.567 --> 03:14.368
But it wasn't Monica.
It was a total stranger.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.451
Who was also
named Monica.

03:16.905 --> 03:18.625
- Made it kind of interesting.
- It's great.

03:19.241 --> 03:20.458
I'm just having a bad day.

03:20.617 --> 03:22.460
- Amy?
- It's our anniversary.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.462
- Five years.
- Five?

03:24.621 --> 03:25.668
That came fast.

03:25.831 --> 03:27.174
And furious.

03:31.712 --> 03:34.807
<i>I'm so crazy,
stupid happy.</i>

03:37.634 --> 03:38.977
<i>I met a boy.</i>

03:39.136 --> 03:43.562
<i>A great, sweet, gorgeous,
cool-ass guy.</i>

03:45.809 --> 03:46.981
Excuse me, miss?

03:47.144 --> 03:48.487
I just want you
to be careful...

03:48.645 --> 03:51.319
where you put down that
monk-brewed Belgian wheat beer...

03:51.481 --> 03:54.075
because the party's down to three
Beast Lights and a bottle of Pucker.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.914
It might attract some
desperate characters.

03:55.986 --> 03:58.830
It could. I mean, the Amish
are on a Rumspringa.

04:02.909 --> 04:05.332
They already relieved me
of my artisanal meat platter.

04:05.495 --> 04:08.248
Finally, someone tells me
how to pronounce that word.

04:08.331 --> 04:09.332
"Meat"?

04:09.416 --> 04:10.668
Yes, "meat."
One syllable.

04:11.001 --> 04:13.550
Thank you. Whose beer
am I about to drink?

04:13.712 --> 04:15.009
Don't tell me.

04:15.672 --> 04:17.345
Let's see,
who's your type?

04:17.716 --> 04:18.716
I don't see you
sitting quietly...

04:18.884 --> 04:22.354
while he bloviates on his
postgrad thesis about Proust.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.685
Uh-oh. Is that him?

04:24.848 --> 04:26.008
Ironic hipster,
so self-aware,

04:26.057 --> 04:27.097
he makes
everything a joke.

04:27.350 --> 04:30.354
I prefer men who are
funny, not "funny."

04:32.189 --> 04:33.406
What type are you?

04:33.565 --> 04:34.908
Corn-fed, salt-of-the-earth
Missouri guy.

04:35.066 --> 04:36.067
- Missouri?
- Mmm-hmm.

04:36.151 --> 04:37.151
- Cute.
- Hmm.

04:37.194 --> 04:38.286
Native New Yorker?

04:38.361 --> 04:39.482
The world ends
at the Hudson.

04:39.571 --> 04:40.572
What's your name?

04:40.655 --> 04:41.655
Amy.

04:41.698 --> 04:44.042
Well, Amy,
who are you?

04:45.368 --> 04:48.417
A, I'm an award-winning
scrimshander.

04:48.580 --> 04:52.630
B, I'm a moderately
influential warlord. Hmm.

04:52.793 --> 04:55.922
C, I write personality
quizzes for magazines.

04:56.296 --> 05:00.392
Okay. Your hands are far too
delicate for real scrimshaw work...

05:00.550 --> 05:03.679
and I happen to be a charter subscriber
to <i>Middling</i> Warlord Weekly...

05:03.845 --> 05:05.062
so I'd recognize you.

05:05.388 --> 05:06.605
I'm gonna go with.

05:06.765 --> 05:08.187
And you?

05:09.017 --> 05:10.439
Who are you?

05:10.602 --> 05:14.948
I'm the guy to save you
from all this awesomeness.

05:19.027 --> 05:21.746
Oh, so, you write for
a men's magazine.

05:21.905 --> 05:24.203
God, does that make you
an expert on being a man?

05:24.282 --> 05:26.284
No.

05:27.077 --> 05:28.357
It's what to wear,
what to drink.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.254
How to bullshit.

05:30.413 --> 05:31.881
Never with you.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.418
- Ha, ha.
- No, I mean it.

05:34.584 --> 05:37.087
- It's hard to believe you.
- Why?

05:37.254 --> 05:38.756
I think it's your chin.

05:38.922 --> 05:39.923
My chin?

05:40.090 --> 05:42.639
Yeah, it's quite villainous.

05:42.801 --> 05:44.428
Okay, how's this?

05:45.428 --> 05:48.602
A hundred percent true,
no bullshit.

05:48.807 --> 05:49.808
Okay-

05:49.975 --> 05:51.443
We all move
to New York...

05:51.601 --> 05:55.606
and we end up living in these little
cubby holes, and that's not it.

05:55.772 --> 05:59.197
Come outside.
Then, you're in it.

06:01.653 --> 06:03.405
You have to see this.

06:11.955 --> 06:14.049
Hey-

06:23.049 --> 06:24.676
I have to kiss you now.

06:24.843 --> 06:26.140
Is that right?

06:26.303 --> 06:29.477
I can't let you go through a
sugar storm unkissed. Hmm.

06:31.099 --> 06:32.476
Oh. Wait a second.

06:35.186 --> 06:36.654
There you go.

06:48.575 --> 06:49.997
Nick Dunne...

06:51.745 --> 06:53.839
I really like you.

07:00.003 --> 07:02.256
So, is Amy gonna do one
of those anniversary...

07:03.214 --> 07:04.386
treasure hunts?

07:04.549 --> 07:06.426
You mean the forced march
designed to prove...

07:06.593 --> 07:09.437
what an oblivious and uncaring
asshole her husband is?

07:09.596 --> 07:10.688
Wow.

07:13.516 --> 07:15.109
Life. I don't
remember the point.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.362
Deep Hasbro thoughts.

07:17.520 --> 07:18.863
Spin.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.783
What was the clue last year
she got so mad about?

07:21.942 --> 07:25.116
"When your poor
Amy has a cold..."

07:25.278 --> 07:26.871
"this dessert
just must be sold."

07:26.988 --> 07:27.988
The answer?

07:28.031 --> 07:29.704
I still don't know
the answer, Go.

07:29.866 --> 07:30.833
A few years ago,
you'd have known.

07:30.909 --> 07:31.990
A few years ago,
it was fun.

07:32.077 --> 07:33.678
Year one, the traditional
gift was paper.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.664
She got me
a beautiful notebook.

07:35.747 --> 07:37.124
Told me to go
write my novel.

07:37.207 --> 07:38.208
What did you get her?

07:38.333 --> 07:39.459
- A kite.
- Hmm.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.469
- She'd never flown a kite.
- Okay.

07:42.420 --> 07:44.889
Anyway.
Year four, flowers.

07:45.048 --> 07:48.302
She led me outside to the dying
rosebush in the backyard.

07:48.385 --> 07:49.511
Ugh, that's symbolic.

07:49.594 --> 07:50.641
Yeah.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.063
What's the gift for five?

07:52.180 --> 07:53.180
Wood.

07:53.223 --> 07:54.224
So, what did you get her?

07:54.307 --> 07:55.467
There's no good gift
for wood.

07:55.558 --> 07:58.778
I know! Go home, fuck her brains
out, slap her with your penis.

07:58.937 --> 08:00.405
"There's some wood
for you, bitch."

08:03.942 --> 08:05.239
The Bar.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.284
Why, yes.
Hang on one second.

08:08.446 --> 08:09.618
Hey, it's Watchful Wally.

08:11.908 --> 08:13.910
Hey, Walt.
What's going on?

08:15.203 --> 08:16.204
Oh.

08:16.287 --> 08:19.382
Thanks very much. I'll be right there.
All right, bye-bye.

08:31.594 --> 08:34.268
Hey, buddy. What are
you doing out here?

08:35.472 --> 08:36.975
Thanks, Walt!

08:52.657 --> 08:54.034
Ame?

09:14.387 --> 09:15.855
Amy!

09:28.151 --> 09:29.152
Hello?

09:29.694 --> 09:31.162
Come on in.

09:31.571 --> 09:32.572
Hey-

09:32.739 --> 09:34.036
- Mister Dunne.
- Hi.

09:34.199 --> 09:36.577
I'm Detective Rhonda Boney.
This is Officer James Gilpin.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.663
We understand there are
concerns about your wife.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.463
I don't know
where my wife is.

09:40.538 --> 09:42.666
And I came home to this.

09:43.708 --> 09:46.507
Now, I don't
panic easily...

09:46.836 --> 09:48.930
but it's weird, right?

09:50.173 --> 09:52.221
- Mind if we look around?
- Please.

09:52.383 --> 09:53.623
How long have
you two been here?

09:53.676 --> 09:56.395
Two years in September.
We used to live in New York.

09:56.554 --> 09:57.555
City?

09:57.680 --> 10:00.684
Yeah, I was a writer.
We were both writers.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.352
Why did you all
move back here?

10:02.519 --> 10:04.021
My mom got sick.

10:04.187 --> 10:07.031
Oh, I'm sorry.
How is she?

10:07.190 --> 10:08.533
She's dead.

10:08.691 --> 10:09.692
I'm so sorry.

10:15.406 --> 10:17.704
What do you
do now, for work?

10:18.576 --> 10:20.419
My sister Margo and I
own The Bar downtown.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.588
Oh, The Bar.

10:22.747 --> 10:24.875
Love the name.
Very meta.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.133
Thanks.

10:29.087 --> 10:30.885
Pretty things.

10:35.635 --> 10:36.852
Stay.

10:37.011 --> 10:38.763
My office, here.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.856
Beautiful dress.

10:47.856 --> 10:49.950
- Date night?
- It's our anniversary.

10:50.024 --> 10:51.025
Hmm.

10:53.111 --> 10:54.613
It's a guest
bedroom, there.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.406
Cat's room on the end.

10:56.573 --> 10:58.120
I checked up here.

11:02.453 --> 11:03.454
This is the kitchen...

11:03.621 --> 11:04.964
obviously.

11:20.722 --> 11:22.440
This is my wife's office.

11:22.599 --> 11:24.226
Amy's office.

11:37.238 --> 11:40.208
Wow. Impressive gal.

11:40.366 --> 11:41.538
Yeah.
Should I be concerned?

11:41.618 --> 11:42.665
I remember these.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.289
I loved these books.

11:49.459 --> 11:50.756
Wait a minute.

11:50.919 --> 11:52.921
Your wife is Amazing Amy?

11:53.504 --> 11:55.723
Yeah. She is.

11:55.882 --> 11:57.509
Wow.

12:00.637 --> 12:04.016
<i>Amazing-fucking-Amy
is getting fucking married.</i>

12:04.182 --> 12:05.855
<i>That's how the night started.</i>

12:06.017 --> 12:09.112
<i>With me, regular,
flawed, real Amy,</i>

12:09.187 --> 12:11.940
<i>jealous, as always,
of the golden child.</i>

12:12.148 --> 12:14.651
<i>Perfect, brilliant,
Amazing Amy,</i>

12:14.734 --> 12:16.736
<i>who's getting
fucking married.</i>

12:17.070 --> 12:18.743
When I was 10,
I quit cello.

12:18.905 --> 12:22.500
In the next book, Amazing
Amy became a prodigy.

12:24.744 --> 12:25.745
Did you play volleyball?

12:25.995 --> 12:27.747
I got cut, freshman year.

12:27.914 --> 12:30.383
She made varsity.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.128
When did you have a dog?

12:33.294 --> 12:34.295
She got the dog.

12:34.921 --> 12:37.299
Puddles made her
more relatable.

12:37.465 --> 12:38.682
Wow.

12:38.841 --> 12:40.843
I love your parents...

12:41.010 --> 12:42.683
but they really
can be assholes.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.188
- Nick!
- Sir!

12:44.347 --> 12:46.850
- Hey, thanks for coming, man.
- No problem.

12:47.016 --> 12:48.438
Hey, sweetheart.

12:49.018 --> 12:50.315
Big night for your mom.

12:50.478 --> 12:54.199
It would mean so much if you
would talk to a few reporters...

12:54.357 --> 12:56.109
bloggers, give them
a little Amy color.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.028
People wanna
hear from you.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.696
- We can't stay long.
- Fantastic.

12:59.862 --> 13:02.035
Fifteen minutes, tops.

13:02.365 --> 13:04.459
This is why
I have my brownstone.

13:04.534 --> 13:06.536
My trust fund.
I know I can't complain.

13:06.703 --> 13:09.206
Your parents literally
plagiarized your childhood.

13:09.372 --> 13:11.215
No, they improved upon it...

13:11.291 --> 13:13.293
and then peddled it
to the masses.

13:13.459 --> 13:15.553
I thought you were gonna wear
white to match the wedding theme.

13:15.712 --> 13:17.055
I thought that would be creepy.

13:17.213 --> 13:19.557
"If it's worth doing,
it's worth doing..."

13:19.716 --> 13:21.935
Hold up! I know how this ends.
Don't tell me.

13:22.093 --> 13:23.766
You're very cute, Nick.

13:23.928 --> 13:25.568
Amy, you know what would
make Dad's night.

13:25.596 --> 13:27.223
Oh, I'm on it.

13:28.516 --> 13:31.395
I love having strangers
pick at my scabs.

13:31.561 --> 13:32.687
<i>I'm curious whether...</i>

13:32.854 --> 13:34.902
it's difficult for you to see
Amazing Amy heading down the aisle.

13:35.189 --> 13:37.908
And this big party celebrating
this fictional wedding.

13:38.067 --> 13:40.286
Because it's my understanding
you are not married.

13:40.445 --> 13:42.118
Is that correct?

13:43.072 --> 13:44.072
Correct.

13:44.115 --> 13:46.709
Amazing Amy has always
been one step ahead of me.

13:46.868 --> 13:50.714
Excuse me. I'm sorry,
I just have a few questions.

13:50.830 --> 13:51.877
It's you.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.589
I'm here in a strictly
journalistic capacity.

13:54.876 --> 13:56.503
Now, you had
the distinct pleasure...

13:56.586 --> 13:58.088
of dating Nick Dunne
for how long?

13:58.254 --> 14:00.928
Two magical years.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.808
In the course of that time,
you've had the opportunity...

14:02.967 --> 14:05.311
to perform such
gracious gestures as...

14:05.470 --> 14:09.270
not correcting Nick when he
pronounced "quinoa" as "kween-o-a."

14:09.432 --> 14:10.775
An understandable mistake.

14:10.933 --> 14:12.093
He also thought
it was a fish.

14:12.143 --> 14:13.736
He thinks
Velveeta is a cheese.

14:14.771 --> 14:16.944
You also manage to appear
shocked and delighted...

14:17.106 --> 14:19.626
when Nick's elderly mother breaks
into an impromptu rendition...

14:19.734 --> 14:21.828
of New York, New York,
every time she sees you.

14:21.986 --> 14:23.909
<i>These bag of bone shoes.</i>

14:24.072 --> 14:25.119
That's just frightening.

14:25.281 --> 14:27.784
You also bought Nick his
very first pair of scissors.

14:27.950 --> 14:29.497
And matching stapler.

14:29.660 --> 14:32.459
Amy Elliott, you are
more than amazing.

14:32.622 --> 14:36.001
You are brilliant,
yet entirely un-snobby.

14:36.167 --> 14:39.671
You challenge me.
You surprise me.

14:39.837 --> 14:41.180
And, fun fact
for the readers...

14:41.589 --> 14:43.307
you have a
world-class vagina.

14:46.094 --> 14:48.438
My colleagues tell me
that you are not yet married.

14:48.971 --> 14:50.644
Is that correct?

14:50.807 --> 14:52.150
I'm not.

14:52.308 --> 14:53.651
Isn't it time
we fixed that?

14:55.103 --> 14:56.650
And then...

14:56.813 --> 14:59.657
<i>the night wasn't
so bad anymore.</i>

15:15.998 --> 15:18.376
And it's done.
Crossed off the list.

15:18.543 --> 15:20.511
Now, normally,
we would not treat this...

15:20.586 --> 15:22.384
as a missing persons
case so quick...

15:22.547 --> 15:23.947
but given the scene
at your house...

15:24.006 --> 15:26.008
and given our spike
in violent crime of late...

15:26.175 --> 15:28.519
we are gonna take this
very, very seriously.

15:28.636 --> 15:29.636
Okay. Good.

15:29.679 --> 15:31.602
We've got forensics
over at your place.

15:31.681 --> 15:32.853
You got somewhere to stay?

15:33.015 --> 15:34.495
- I could stay at my sister's.
- Okay.

15:34.642 --> 15:36.815
We're tracking Amy's phone,
her credit cards.

15:36.978 --> 15:38.579
We will organize searches,
put up flyers.

15:38.688 --> 15:40.281
We're gonna hold
a press conference tomorrow.

15:40.356 --> 15:41.636
You're having
a press conference?

15:41.732 --> 15:43.279
I wanna get
the word out, right?

15:43.359 --> 15:45.282
Yeah, it's just
all of a sudden...

15:45.361 --> 15:47.614
I feel like I'm on
a Law & <i>Order</i> episode.

15:55.705 --> 15:57.753
Time is of the essence
in these cases.

15:57.915 --> 16:00.543
But, that said, do you wanna
wait and call a lawyer?

16:00.710 --> 16:01.711
Absolutely not.
I just wanna help.

16:01.878 --> 16:03.551
So, you and Amy
have been here two years.

16:03.713 --> 16:06.842
- You tend bar...
- I own The Bar.

16:07.008 --> 16:10.387
And I teach
creative writing at MVCC.

16:10.553 --> 16:12.226
- No kids?
- Not yet.

16:12.388 --> 16:13.731
So, what does Amy
do most days?

16:13.890 --> 16:16.109
A woman with all those
degrees, what does she do?

16:16.601 --> 16:17.898
I don't know.
She keeps busy.

16:18.060 --> 16:19.562
Doing what?

16:21.772 --> 16:23.274
She's a voracious reader.

16:23.441 --> 16:26.285
So, she's always got
a book in her hand.

16:27.361 --> 16:28.704
Well, days can get long.

16:28.863 --> 16:32.584
I know a few housewives, that evening
glass of wine starts coming at noon.

16:32.742 --> 16:33.914
Or prescription pills.

16:34.076 --> 16:35.476
Just last week,
we had a soccer mom.

16:35.620 --> 16:37.964
Nice lady. Got her teeth
kicked in over some OxyContin.

16:38.122 --> 16:40.090
Ever since that mall went bust,
half the town is out of work.

16:40.249 --> 16:41.592
We cannot keep up
with the drug violence.

16:41.792 --> 16:44.090
I'm pretty sure
that's not it.

16:44.253 --> 16:45.846
Has Amy got friends
we can talk to?

16:45.922 --> 16:47.048
Um...

16:48.090 --> 16:49.262
No, not really.

16:49.425 --> 16:51.268
No friends?
This whole town?

16:51.427 --> 16:54.931
She was very close with my
mom, before she passed away.

16:55.097 --> 16:57.217
You know, we have a pretty
serious homeless problem...

16:57.266 --> 16:58.392
in our neighborhood.

16:58.726 --> 17:00.486
I think maybe you guys
should check that out.

17:01.521 --> 17:02.647
We'll look into that.

17:02.813 --> 17:05.316
You got to The Bar
around 11:00 today.

17:05.483 --> 17:06.951
Where were you before that?
Just to cross that out.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.027
Well, I was home.

17:08.109 --> 17:10.613
I left at 9:30, I got a cup
of coffee, a newspaper.

17:10.780 --> 17:12.381
I went to Sawyer Beach
and read the news.

17:12.448 --> 17:14.496
Did you visit
with anyone there?

17:14.659 --> 17:16.627
I kind of go to Sawyer Beach
for the solitude.

17:17.787 --> 17:20.256
So, your wife has
no friends here.

17:20.414 --> 17:22.132
Is she kinda standoffish?

17:22.290 --> 17:24.589
Ivy League?
Rubs people the wrong way?

17:24.752 --> 17:26.971
- She's from New York.
- Oh.

17:27.421 --> 17:30.550
She's complicated. She's
got very high standards.

17:30.633 --> 17:31.634
Type A?

17:31.968 --> 17:34.437
That can make you crazy
if you're not like that.

17:34.595 --> 17:36.063
You seem pretty laid-back.

17:36.138 --> 17:37.310
Type B.

17:37.473 --> 17:39.646
Speaking of which,
Amy's blood type?

17:40.184 --> 17:41.857
God, I don't know. I'd have
to look it up at the house.

17:42.019 --> 17:43.419
You don't know
if she has friends...

17:43.437 --> 17:44.689
you don't know what
she does all day...

17:44.855 --> 17:46.653
and you don't know
your wife's blood type.

17:46.816 --> 17:47.942
Sure you all are married?

17:49.235 --> 17:50.532
Uh... Maybe it's type O.

17:50.695 --> 17:52.789
- Where are her folks? New York?
- Yeah.

17:52.947 --> 17:54.540
Can they get here time for this
press conference tomorrow?

17:54.699 --> 17:56.699
Tomorrow? I have no idea.
I haven't talked to them.

17:56.784 --> 17:58.502
You haven't called
your wife's parents yet?

17:58.661 --> 17:59.787
You can't get a signal
in this building.

17:59.870 --> 18:00.962
I've been in here
talking to you.

18:01.122 --> 18:03.466
Call them,
please, Nick. Now.

18:03.624 --> 18:04.841
Fine.

18:10.339 --> 18:12.262
Should I know
my wife's blood type?

18:12.341 --> 18:13.342
No.

18:13.676 --> 18:17.351
I apologize, Marybeth. I
didn't know what was going on.

18:17.513 --> 18:18.890
Now I'm at the station...

18:19.056 --> 18:20.433
and the cops
are at the house,

18:20.516 --> 18:22.564
and it's serious
and I'm calling you.

18:23.269 --> 18:26.113
There's a lot of things that
are being juggled right now.

18:26.272 --> 18:29.401
I'm standing right next to
Detective Rhonda Boney...

18:29.567 --> 18:31.535
who's the lead investigator
on this and she's...

18:33.779 --> 18:35.952
My mother-in-law would
like to speak with you.

18:37.366 --> 18:38.538
This is Detective Boney.

18:38.701 --> 18:39.918
I wanna go home.

18:40.077 --> 18:42.421
I don't know why
I have to be here.

18:42.580 --> 18:45.083
I don't wanna be here.
I wanna go home.

18:45.249 --> 18:46.375
Dad?

18:46.792 --> 18:48.260
This is my father.
What's going on?

18:48.419 --> 18:49.466
Really?
You're Nick Dunne?

18:49.712 --> 18:51.589
We've been trying to get a
hold of you all afternoon.

18:51.756 --> 18:53.396
I've been right there.
My wife is missing.

18:53.466 --> 18:54.467
- Bitch.
- Don't.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.887
Your father wandered out of
Comfort Hill after lunch.

18:57.053 --> 18:59.306
We found him walking
Route 79, disoriented.

18:59.472 --> 19:00.815
We've been trying to
call you for the last...

19:00.973 --> 19:02.099
I don't get a cell signal
in this building.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.234
I've been sitting
20 feet away from you.

19:04.560 --> 19:06.161
Sir, please don't take
that tone with me.

19:06.228 --> 19:07.229
Stupid, dumb,
ugly bitch.

19:07.396 --> 19:08.943
Dad, stop.

19:11.609 --> 19:12.826
You wanna drive him home?

19:13.486 --> 19:15.784
I think that would be wise.
Thanks.

19:35.341 --> 19:38.436
<i>This voice
mailbox is currently full.</i>

19:39.136 --> 19:40.262
Fuck.

19:42.473 --> 19:44.942
Oh, get your
fucking hands off me.

19:45.101 --> 19:46.478
Thanks.

19:59.281 --> 20:03.331
<i>Everyone told us
and told us and told us...</i>

20:03.494 --> 20:05.963
<i>marriage is hard work.</i>

20:06.122 --> 20:09.046
<i>And compromise
and more work.</i>

20:09.208 --> 20:11.336
<i>"Abandon all hope,
ye who enter."</i>

20:11.502 --> 20:14.301
"When young Amy's
hope did wane..."

20:14.463 --> 20:15.680
"she wandered here..."

20:15.840 --> 20:18.218
<i>Well, it's not true.
Not for me and Nick.</i>

20:18.384 --> 20:20.887
"...in search of Jane."

20:21.053 --> 20:23.977
<i>With us, two years...</i>

20:24.223 --> 20:25.645
<i>it's just good.</i>

20:26.142 --> 20:28.645
Austen. Hmm.

20:29.478 --> 20:33.483
You were an alienated teen and only
Elizabeth Bennet understood you.

20:33.983 --> 20:35.985
Look at that.

20:37.820 --> 20:39.493
My God.

20:39.697 --> 20:40.869
You naughty minx.

20:41.031 --> 20:44.001
Well, technically, we are supposed
to fuck at the next stop.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.662
Yeah, in keeping
with tradition.

20:45.828 --> 20:49.207
But I might be willing
to bend the rules this once.

20:49.373 --> 20:51.091
God bless Jane Austen.

21:06.432 --> 21:08.025
I'm enthusiastic.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.444
Look at that.
It's confirmed by the...

21:13.397 --> 21:15.695
Oh, thank you.

21:16.734 --> 21:18.202
Year two. Cotton.

21:24.950 --> 21:29.080
We had that joke that our sex
was too good for ordinary.

21:29.246 --> 21:31.715
So, these are
2,000 thread-count...

21:36.754 --> 21:38.381
We're so cute.

21:38.464 --> 21:39.585
I wanna punch us
in the face.

21:39.715 --> 21:42.935
That's pretty great.
I mean, that is pretty great.

21:44.386 --> 21:45.786
Did they ask if
you wanted a lawyer?

21:45.888 --> 21:48.061
I don't need a lawyer.
Here, I'll do this.

21:48.557 --> 21:50.400
Well, did they ask
personal stuff about Amy?

21:50.559 --> 21:51.731
You know, they asked...

21:52.061 --> 21:54.280
- why didn't she have any friends?
- What did you say?

21:54.438 --> 21:56.440
- I said she was complicated.
- Nick!

21:57.441 --> 22:00.069
Everyone knows "complicated" is
code for "bitch."

22:04.990 --> 22:07.163
Oh, God.
I feel sick.

22:07.326 --> 22:08.748
Thanks.

22:09.745 --> 22:10.917
It's so bizarre.

22:11.080 --> 22:13.458
It seems like the kind of thing
that would happen to Amy.

22:13.624 --> 22:14.671
She always attracts...

22:14.834 --> 22:16.427
Drama?

22:17.253 --> 22:18.505
You can say it.
It's just me and you.

22:18.671 --> 22:21.094
Just because I don't
like to be around Amy...

22:21.257 --> 22:22.657
doesn't mean
I don't care about her.

22:25.594 --> 22:27.767
Anyway, whoever took her
is bound to bring her back.

22:37.106 --> 22:39.029
Detective?
Excuse me.

22:39.191 --> 22:41.819
I'm Noelle Hawthorne.
I'm Amy's best friend.

22:42.945 --> 22:45.619
Well, great.
Where do you live, Noelle?

22:46.156 --> 22:47.533
Five doors down. 1032.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.794
Wonderful. I would
love to talk to you.

22:49.952 --> 22:51.704
Can I come by
in half an hour?

22:51.871 --> 22:53.464
- Y'all know anything yet?
- I'm sorry.

22:53.622 --> 22:55.044
I got guys on
the clock in here.

22:55.124 --> 22:56.296
But you give me 30 minutes.

22:56.458 --> 22:57.801
But that's usually
bath time.

22:58.544 --> 23:01.138
Well, we'll talk
in between shampoos.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.083
All right.
So, what do you got?

23:05.217 --> 23:07.845
It was definitely blood spatter
you saw in the kitchen.

23:08.345 --> 23:09.892
Normally, kitchen,
knives, food prep.

23:10.055 --> 23:12.308
Not that weird,
but that is awfully high.

23:12.474 --> 23:13.976
So, I'm gonna order
a luminol sweep.

23:14.143 --> 23:15.269
Well, okay.

23:17.688 --> 23:18.985
Mmm, interesting.

23:19.148 --> 23:20.149
What's that?

23:20.316 --> 23:22.535
House is rented in her name.

23:22.610 --> 23:23.702
Car's in her name.

23:23.861 --> 23:26.865
Credit cards, utilities,
phone bill, all in her name.

23:27.031 --> 23:28.749
Even his bar's in her name.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.706
I don't know that
that's so surprising.

23:30.868 --> 23:32.370
No. But it is humiliating.

23:32.453 --> 23:33.453
What you got?

23:33.495 --> 23:36.339
It's with
her unmentionables.

23:48.677 --> 23:51.556
Well, we have
our first clue.

24:02.650 --> 24:04.197
I have to take a shower.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.033
No, don't.
You've been up all night.

24:06.195 --> 24:08.368
You wanna look like you've
been up all night.

24:09.990 --> 24:12.209
Hey, be careful today, okay?

24:12.368 --> 24:13.585
That's a weird thing to say.

24:13.744 --> 24:15.621
Well, when you're upset,
you bottle up.

24:15.704 --> 24:17.377
You can seem angry, like...

24:17.539 --> 24:18.916
Please don't say,
"Like Dad."

24:19.083 --> 24:20.630
Or else you swing into your
momma's-boy charm offensive...

24:20.709 --> 24:22.632
and that can feel glib.
Perfect.

24:22.711 --> 24:25.339
I'll balance on the exact fucking
edge of your emotional razor.

24:25.506 --> 24:27.224
Okay. Just be...

24:27.383 --> 24:29.181
Myself?

24:29.343 --> 24:31.562
<i>...sponsoring a
raffle to benefit West County 4H...</i>

24:31.720 --> 24:35.065
<i>and raffling season tickets
for Mizzou football.</i>

24:35.224 --> 24:38.524
<i>Buy your tickets at the Wing Hut
or local Tri-State Tire stores.</i>

24:43.107 --> 24:44.450
Your in-laws made it.

24:46.276 --> 24:47.277
Hi, Rand.
Hey, man.

24:47.361 --> 24:48.361
I'm Detective Boney.

24:48.404 --> 24:50.247
I'm the twin. Margo.

24:50.406 --> 24:51.999
We played tennis
yesterday, Nick.

24:52.074 --> 24:53.371
I just can't get over it.

24:53.534 --> 24:54.751
Marybeth,
I am really sorry.

24:54.910 --> 24:56.670
I knew you never should
have moved back here.

24:56.745 --> 24:57.746
We didn't have
a lot of choice.

24:57.913 --> 25:01.463
We are all worried.
We are all scared.

25:01.625 --> 25:03.298
But we are all here now.

25:03.377 --> 25:06.096
And we will find
Amy, together.

25:16.306 --> 25:18.104
Should I just go first, and then
you guys can say something?

25:18.225 --> 25:19.226
Good.

25:20.894 --> 25:25.115
As you know, my wife,
Amy Elliott Dunne...

25:25.274 --> 25:28.073
disappeared from our home
on the morning of July 5th...

25:29.028 --> 25:31.451
under suspicious
circumstances.

25:31.613 --> 25:32.956
Louder!

25:33.115 --> 25:37.370
If anyone out there, uh,
has any information...

25:37.578 --> 25:39.797
please come forward.

25:39.955 --> 25:41.582
Thank you.

25:43.917 --> 25:46.636
I'm Rand Elliott.
My wife, Marybeth Elliott.

25:46.795 --> 25:47.887
Should I have
said my name?

25:48.464 --> 25:50.307
Amy is our only child.

25:50.466 --> 25:54.471
She's bright, she's beautiful.
She's kind.

25:54.970 --> 25:56.472
She really is Amazing Amy.

25:56.805 --> 25:59.399
You know, there are millions
of people out there...

25:59.558 --> 26:01.981
who grew up with her
and care about her.

26:02.144 --> 26:04.772
We care about her,
we love her.

26:05.481 --> 26:08.075
And we just
want her back.

26:09.985 --> 26:12.488
Amy is a decorated scholar.

26:12.654 --> 26:15.498
She forged a successful
career in journalism.

26:15.657 --> 26:17.830
She returned here to
her husband's hometown...

26:17.993 --> 26:20.337
and she made a life
in her adopted home.

26:21.413 --> 26:23.666
Now, Amy needs your help.

26:23.832 --> 26:27.837
We're establishing a volunteer
headquarters at the Drury Lodge.

26:28.003 --> 26:33.351
We have a hotline,
1-855-4-AMY-TIPS.

26:33.592 --> 26:39.019
And our website is
wvvw.FindAmazingAmy.com.

26:39.515 --> 26:41.438
- Mr. Dunne!
- Mr. Elliott!

26:42.851 --> 26:44.851
Mr. Dunne, any signs of foul play?

26:46.438 --> 26:50.113
Mr. Elliott, when was the last
time you spoke to your daughter?

26:51.610 --> 26:52.611
Smile.

26:59.201 --> 27:00.794
That's all for now.
Thank you.

27:03.372 --> 27:06.091
Amy is the kind of girl
who attracts admirers.

27:06.250 --> 27:08.218
- Right, Nick?
- Yeah, definitely.

27:08.377 --> 27:10.755
And we've had instances...

27:10.921 --> 27:12.844
- where things got...
- Scary.

27:13.006 --> 27:14.349
Do you know
about Desi Collings?

27:14.508 --> 27:16.055
Yeah, I know
all about Desi Collings.

27:16.218 --> 27:17.344
He was obsessed.

27:17.511 --> 27:20.731
He attempted suicide after Amy
broke up with him sophomore year.

27:20.889 --> 27:22.311
We had to file
a restraining order.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.727
This would be high school?
Twenty years ago?

27:24.893 --> 27:26.486
But he recently moved
to St. Louis.

27:26.562 --> 27:27.984
That's just two hours away.

27:28.147 --> 27:29.899
To be fair,
he is from St. Louis.

27:30.065 --> 27:31.567
We also have
Tommy O'Hara.

27:31.733 --> 27:33.827
This is only eight years
ago, in New York.

27:33.986 --> 27:36.159
She broke up with him,
he got very physical.

27:36.321 --> 27:38.001
- She filed charges.
- What was the charge?

27:38.031 --> 27:39.999
Sexual assault,
threat, battery, what?

27:40.159 --> 27:42.002
I only know it was bad.

27:42.161 --> 27:43.834
- I didn't know this.
- Okay.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.373
Thank you.

27:45.455 --> 27:47.253
Uh, anything more recent?

27:50.586 --> 27:52.588
Not that I know of.

27:55.048 --> 27:57.972
Hey, Nick?
You got a minute?

27:59.136 --> 28:00.763
Yeah.

28:06.143 --> 28:07.395
Imagine our confusion.

28:07.561 --> 28:08.608
A missing persons case...

28:08.770 --> 28:09.987
and in your
wife's dressing room...

28:10.063 --> 28:11.384
we find an envelope
marked "clue."

28:11.398 --> 28:13.526
That's for our anniversary.

28:13.692 --> 28:15.865
My wife does
these treasure hunts.

28:16.028 --> 28:18.281
I'm hoping you can tell me
what this means.

28:18.447 --> 28:19.448
You want to solve
Amy's treasure hunt?

28:19.865 --> 28:22.185
It'll help me track Amy's
movements before she disappeared.

28:22.409 --> 28:24.457
Of course. Okay.

28:24.620 --> 28:27.214
"Although this spot
couldn't be tighter..."

28:27.956 --> 28:30.675
"it's a cozy room
for my favorite writer."

28:33.503 --> 28:34.720
I know this one!

28:35.214 --> 28:38.718
<i>Although this spot
couldn't be any tighter...</i>

28:39.343 --> 28:42.142
<i>it's a cozy room for
my favorite writer.</i>

28:43.639 --> 28:46.939
<i>After-school meeting,
don't mind if I do.</i>

28:47.100 --> 28:50.024
<i>Maybe I'll teach
you a thing or two.</i>

28:54.066 --> 28:56.285
Well, well.
What does it say?

28:56.443 --> 28:57.945
Clue two.

28:59.071 --> 29:02.450
"Hey, handsome man,
let's go undercover."

29:02.950 --> 29:06.830
"You'll be the spy,
and I'll be his lover."

29:06.995 --> 29:08.247
"Let's head on over..."

29:08.413 --> 29:10.165
"to the little brown house."

29:10.332 --> 29:14.053
"We'll play hot, doting
husband, sweet, loving spouse."

29:16.797 --> 29:17.844
These yours?

29:18.590 --> 29:19.591
No.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.101
But you read
the first clue.

29:21.260 --> 29:24.264
Randy professor,
naughty student.

29:24.346 --> 29:25.347
I blush.

29:25.514 --> 29:27.266
Me and my ex
just swapped cards.

29:28.475 --> 29:29.727
Where's this
little brown house?

29:29.893 --> 29:31.395
I have no idea.

30:14.604 --> 30:15.981
Hello?

30:16.648 --> 30:18.525
Nicholas Dunne.

30:19.192 --> 30:22.287
Under my father's name, William Dunne.

30:28.702 --> 30:30.500
My wife's first pet?
Is this necessary?

30:30.579 --> 30:32.673
Can you just
turn the bell...

30:32.748 --> 30:33.749
Yeah, I know.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.800
It's, uh... It's, uh...

30:36.585 --> 30:37.837
Uh...

30:37.919 --> 30:40.217
It's "Puddles," right?
Or is it "Poodles?"

30:44.134 --> 30:45.761
We're good.

30:47.346 --> 30:48.347
Hello, stranger.

30:48.513 --> 30:50.515
Fancy meeting you here.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.855
It's your
dad's house, right?

30:53.018 --> 30:55.441
- Are you following me?
- What you doing?

30:55.604 --> 30:57.652
Like you said,
it's my dad's house.

30:57.814 --> 31:00.533
I come by once a week, make sure
the place hasn't burned down.

31:02.319 --> 31:03.616
But it looks okay.

31:04.363 --> 31:06.240
I'll walk you out.

31:09.493 --> 31:10.870
You know...

31:11.036 --> 31:14.165
I thought maybe this was
the little brown house.

31:14.331 --> 31:15.423
From the clue.

31:15.582 --> 31:17.550
Nope. Still blue.

31:34.017 --> 31:38.113
<i>Picture me, I'm a
girl who's very, very bad.</i>

31:38.271 --> 31:41.992
<i>I need to be punished, and
by "punished," I mean "had."</i>

31:42.484 --> 31:45.613
<i>It's where you keep goodies
for anniversary five.</i>

31:45.904 --> 31:49.659
"So open the door,
and look alive."

31:50.951 --> 31:51.998
Bitch!

31:55.705 --> 31:58.709
<i>Want to test your
marriage for weak spots?</i>

31:59.376 --> 32:00.844
<i>Add one recession...</i>

32:01.169 --> 32:02.466
<i>subtract two jobs.</i>

32:03.046 --> 32:05.048
<i>It's surprisingly effective.</i>

32:05.215 --> 32:07.513
Promise me we'll
never be like them.

32:07.676 --> 32:08.677
Like who?

32:08.844 --> 32:10.471
All those awful
couples we know.

32:10.637 --> 32:14.483
Those wives who treat their
men like dancing monkeys...

32:14.641 --> 32:16.109
to be trained and paraded.

32:16.726 --> 32:19.445
Husbands who treat their wives
like the highway patrol...

32:19.813 --> 32:22.407
to be out-foxed
and avoided.

32:27.154 --> 32:28.827
I think I'm gonna
be laid off.

32:29.614 --> 32:32.288
We're in a recession. If it
happens, we'll deal with it.

32:32.451 --> 32:34.545
I'll probably be next.

32:34.703 --> 32:35.955
We have each other.

32:36.329 --> 32:38.878
Everything else is
background noise.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.756
You are exceptional.

32:49.468 --> 32:50.720
My turn.

32:52.596 --> 32:54.269
My parents' publisher
dropped them...

32:54.347 --> 32:55.815
and they're in debt
up to their ears.

32:55.891 --> 32:56.892
That's terrible.

32:56.975 --> 32:59.273
And they need to borrow
from my trust fund.

32:59.436 --> 33:00.813
How much?

33:00.979 --> 33:03.198
Almost a million.

33:03.773 --> 33:05.241
That's almost all of it.

33:05.400 --> 33:07.528
This is where you say, "Everything
else is background noise."

33:07.611 --> 33:08.658
Amy, if you're laid off...

33:08.945 --> 33:10.071
and I'm laid off...

33:10.238 --> 33:11.239
I said I'd do it.

33:11.406 --> 33:12.532
Without talking to me?

33:12.699 --> 33:14.167
- Well, it's...
- Your call.

33:14.326 --> 33:15.919
...their money,
technically.

33:20.332 --> 33:22.005
You know what?
You're right.

33:22.626 --> 33:24.628
Everything else
is just background noise.

33:33.595 --> 33:34.596
Hey-

33:38.725 --> 33:39.772
More games?

33:39.935 --> 33:41.528
Yeah, I just wanted
to shoot some folks.

33:42.771 --> 33:44.239
What's the laptop for?

33:45.315 --> 33:46.316
Laptop-ing.

33:48.276 --> 33:49.368
Oh, I see.

33:49.528 --> 33:52.532
You can give your parents
$879,000 without talking to me...

33:53.073 --> 33:54.473
but God forbid
I buy a video game...

33:54.533 --> 33:55.580
without getting
your permission.

33:55.742 --> 33:56.743
You are spending a lot.

33:56.826 --> 33:58.954
You don't trust me.
You don't trust my judgment.

33:59.120 --> 34:00.542
You certainly don't
trust my intention.

34:00.622 --> 34:01.703
What are you talking about?

34:01.706 --> 34:03.208
That's the basic tenet
of a prenup, isn't it?

34:03.375 --> 34:05.503
Why are you throwing
that in my face again?

34:05.669 --> 34:07.922
- Because it's easy to throw.
- Nick, I don't get it.

34:08.088 --> 34:09.886
I don't get why
you're daring me...

34:09.965 --> 34:11.308
to be someone
I don't wanna be.

34:11.466 --> 34:14.436
The nagging shrew.
The controlling bitch.

34:14.594 --> 34:16.847
I'm not that person. I'm your wife.

34:17.013 --> 34:18.060
I'm sorry.

34:18.223 --> 34:20.543
I just don't know how to do this.
I've never not had a job.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.476
I flipped burgers,
I painted houses.

34:22.643 --> 34:24.646
You'll get another job.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.284
Hi, Go.

34:32.027 --> 34:33.655
What? Hold on. What?

34:33.822 --> 34:35.119
<i>And suddenly...
Slow down, what is it?</i>

34:35.282 --> 34:37.202
<i>...I knew everything
was about to get worse.</i>

34:37.324 --> 34:38.918
Okay, tell me
what's wrong.

35:06.271 --> 35:07.773
Bless you, Nick.
Father.

35:08.440 --> 35:09.737
Hey, Tom. Mayor!

35:09.899 --> 35:10.991
Nick, good to see you.

35:11.067 --> 35:12.068
Good to see you.

35:12.235 --> 35:13.487
Hey, guys, hey-

35:15.905 --> 35:17.407
- Jodie.
- Nick.

35:19.117 --> 35:21.836
Oh, we'll find her.
Mmm-hmm.

35:35.717 --> 35:37.310
You look like
hammered shit.

35:37.469 --> 35:39.142
Oh, thank you.

35:47.228 --> 35:48.948
You ever see that guy
in the glasses before?

35:49.606 --> 35:51.153
Don't worry.
We videotape everybody...

35:51.232 --> 35:52.233
that comes in
and out of these things.

35:52.400 --> 35:54.027
I mean, you tend
to get a lot of...

35:54.110 --> 35:55.157
Do-gooders?

35:55.320 --> 35:56.412
Freaks.

35:56.571 --> 35:58.414
Hey, I meant to ask you.

35:58.573 --> 36:00.746
Noelle Hawthorne?

36:00.909 --> 36:02.629
She lives on your street.
Amy's best friend.

36:03.745 --> 36:04.962
I've never heard the name
Noelle Hawthorne.

36:05.121 --> 36:07.169
She and her husband
have triplets.

36:07.332 --> 36:08.424
Oh.

36:08.625 --> 36:11.469
Yeah, we might say
hi to them on the street.

36:11.836 --> 36:13.964
But "best friend"? No.

36:14.089 --> 36:16.209
Excuse me, one sec.

36:20.053 --> 36:22.021
He acted like Noelle was
a complete stranger.

36:22.180 --> 36:23.272
Of course he did.

36:23.640 --> 36:24.812
Look, these two are yours.

36:24.974 --> 36:27.227
Oh, look.
He's being a good guy...

36:27.394 --> 36:29.192
so everybody can see him
being a good guy.

36:29.354 --> 36:31.027
Oh, you really don't
like him, do you?

36:31.189 --> 36:32.691
What's to like?

36:54.379 --> 36:56.723
<i>This mailbox is currently full.</i>

36:56.798 --> 36:57.890
<i>Press one to...</i>

36:58.049 --> 37:01.428
Nick? I just wanted to introduce myself.
My name's Shawna Kelly.

37:01.678 --> 37:04.272
I am so sorry
for your troubles.

37:04.431 --> 37:06.684
- Thank you. That's kind.
- Are you remembering to eat?

37:06.850 --> 37:07.851
Well, a lot of cold cuts.

37:08.017 --> 37:12.067
I'm gonna fix you up my
world-famous chicken Frito pie.

37:12.230 --> 37:13.710
That's very kind
and very unnecessary.

37:13.773 --> 37:15.400
You have to
keep your strength.

37:15.859 --> 37:16.906
Would you...

37:17.819 --> 37:19.696
say, "Chicken Frito pie!"

37:22.657 --> 37:23.829
Um...

37:23.908 --> 37:25.205
You know what?

37:26.453 --> 37:27.705
Would you delete
that picture for me?

37:27.871 --> 37:29.623
It's a nice photo.
I know it is.

37:29.789 --> 37:31.086
But just do me a favor.

37:31.249 --> 37:32.876
Will you?

37:33.042 --> 37:35.841
Would you go ahead and
please delete that picture?

37:36.004 --> 37:37.004
You just press...

37:37.046 --> 37:38.423
What is
wrong with you?

37:38.590 --> 37:39.762
Could you please not
share that with anyone?

37:39.924 --> 37:43.269
I will share it
with whomever I please.

37:47.056 --> 37:48.308
Dude.
Yeah?

37:48.475 --> 37:49.818
Marybeth is pissed.

37:50.226 --> 37:51.318
Why?

37:54.189 --> 37:55.657
Marybeth?

37:55.815 --> 37:59.240
It's like you're the
goddamn Homecoming King.

38:01.654 --> 38:03.998
It was important to my
mother that I be polite...

38:04.157 --> 38:05.955
I be considerate,
I be a gentleman.

38:06.117 --> 38:07.710
It looked like
you were having fun.

38:07.869 --> 38:10.122
I am in a nightmare!

38:10.830 --> 38:13.128
All I'm trying to do
is be nice...

38:13.291 --> 38:17.012
to the people who are
volunteering to help find Amy.

38:18.963 --> 38:20.715
You're right.

38:21.591 --> 38:23.559
And I'm sorry.

38:25.553 --> 38:29.183
My God, this place literally
smells like feces.

38:40.151 --> 38:43.371
In your searches, did you find
any golf clubs, real fancy?

38:43.530 --> 38:44.952
No.

38:46.074 --> 38:47.667
How about a brand
new Stratocaster?

38:47.826 --> 38:48.952
No, nothing like that.

38:49.661 --> 38:51.755
Well, all right.

38:56.751 --> 38:59.675
How big's that TV?
It's not 65-inch.

38:59.838 --> 39:01.010
No, it's nowhere
near that.

39:01.172 --> 39:02.264
Okay-

39:02.715 --> 39:04.012
- Kibble?
- Excuse me?

39:04.175 --> 39:06.143
He asked me
to feed his cat.

39:06.302 --> 39:07.519
Oh, I saw some in the pantry.

39:07.846 --> 39:12.477
Detective Boney, Officer Gilpin?
Noelle Hawthorne!

39:12.642 --> 39:14.110
I know y'all are in there!

39:14.269 --> 39:16.442
Would you please
escort Miss Hawthorne...

39:16.521 --> 39:18.774
and her children
back out to the street?

39:19.649 --> 39:21.617
Detective Boney!

39:21.776 --> 39:25.622
Just remind her it is a
possible crime scene.

39:34.330 --> 39:36.799
<i>Look at that
pie-eating grin...</i>

39:36.875 --> 39:39.173
<i>from a guy whose
wife is missing.</i>

39:44.966 --> 39:46.559
- How are you doing?
- Terrific.

39:48.303 --> 39:49.680
How's Marybeth?

39:49.846 --> 39:51.564
She's a wreck.

39:51.723 --> 39:53.191
And you?

39:53.808 --> 39:55.310
Awesome.

39:55.393 --> 39:56.394
Hey...

39:56.477 --> 39:58.070
have you told
me everything?

39:58.313 --> 40:00.156
- Of course.
- Everything?

40:00.315 --> 40:01.515
Why would you
even ask me that?

40:01.524 --> 40:05.700
Ever since you walked into The Bar that
morning Amy went missing, you seem...

40:06.988 --> 40:07.989
- off.
- I am off.

40:09.032 --> 40:12.252
Everybody's examining me and
projecting their shit on me.

40:12.410 --> 40:15.710
All I want is to come over
here, have a beer with you...

40:15.872 --> 40:17.089
and not be judged.

40:17.248 --> 40:18.750
Can we do that?

40:19.834 --> 40:21.177
Of course.

40:22.545 --> 40:24.422
You know what
I keep thinking?

40:24.589 --> 40:25.590
If Mom were here?

40:25.673 --> 40:29.098
Yeah. Like I'm 12.

40:30.553 --> 40:33.352
Nick, Mom would fix it.

40:40.563 --> 40:43.783
I'm gonna go Benadryl
myself to sleep.

40:46.694 --> 40:49.038
- Love you.
- Love you.

40:53.368 --> 40:55.291
<i>So, here's a strange,
new sentence.</i>

40:55.453 --> 40:58.923
<i>I am a Missourian.</i>

41:05.254 --> 41:07.097
Mmm, bye, Dad.

41:09.008 --> 41:12.353
<i>No money, no jobs,
no prospects.</i>

41:12.512 --> 41:14.560
<i>And then,
we heard from Go.</i>

41:14.722 --> 41:16.520
Mama Maureen...

41:16.683 --> 41:19.527
<i>Stage 4 breast cancer.</i>

41:21.688 --> 41:24.407
<i>So, we moved to Missouri.</i>

41:24.565 --> 41:26.067
<i>I don't mind.</i>

41:26.234 --> 41:29.408
<i>I just wish he'd asked.</i>

41:41.082 --> 41:43.426
<i>Nick is happy to be home.</i>

41:43.584 --> 41:46.087
<i>But I don't know
if he's happy I'm with him.</i>

41:47.588 --> 41:50.717
<i>I feel like something
he loaded by mistake.</i>

41:50.883 --> 41:53.932
<i>Something to be jettisoned,
if necessary.</i>

41:54.095 --> 41:56.314
<i>Something disposable.</i>

41:58.141 --> 42:00.769
<i>I feel like
I could disappear.</i>

42:44.771 --> 42:46.648
Oh, my God!

42:46.814 --> 42:48.657
- I saw you on TV.
- Okay.

42:48.816 --> 42:50.363
- It's so crazy.
- Yeah, I know.

42:50.526 --> 42:52.620
- She just vanished?
- She's just gone.

42:52.779 --> 42:54.497
- I've been so worried about you.
- Where have you been?

42:54.655 --> 42:56.373
I called you a hundred times.
You gotta pick up your phone!

42:56.532 --> 42:58.534
- Rehearsals.
- What?

42:58.701 --> 42:59.998
<i>Godspell.</i>

43:01.829 --> 43:03.297
My sister's
asleep in the other room.

43:03.456 --> 43:04.457
I needed to see you.

43:04.624 --> 43:06.171
I know this is a bad idea.

43:06.334 --> 43:07.774
Can you at least
tell me you love me?

43:07.877 --> 43:11.507
I do love you, but we have to
be really careful right now.

43:11.672 --> 43:12.798
Oh, I've been so scared.

43:12.965 --> 43:14.057
Between rehearsals?

43:14.217 --> 43:15.844
You told me I needed
to have my own life.

43:16.010 --> 43:17.387
I know.

43:17.553 --> 43:18.679
We need to stop.

43:18.846 --> 43:20.018
I need you.

43:21.140 --> 43:22.983
Touch me.

43:26.395 --> 43:29.023
Stop it. Come here.

43:30.399 --> 43:31.992
Sit down.

43:32.151 --> 43:33.368
Okay-

43:33.528 --> 43:37.499
Did you, by any chance, tell
anybody anything about us?

43:37.657 --> 43:39.034
Even in texting,
or on Facebook.

43:39.200 --> 43:41.874
Facebook? I use
the disposable phone.

43:42.036 --> 43:43.834
You buy my presents in cash.
I'm not stupid, Nick.

43:43.996 --> 43:46.749
I know, sweetie. Did you leave a
pair of red panties in my office?

43:46.916 --> 43:50.216
I don't know. Maybe.
They better be mine.

43:50.336 --> 43:51.336
Sweetheart, think.

43:51.379 --> 43:53.723
I don't know. I'd have to
check my red panty inventory.

43:53.881 --> 43:56.384
Andie, I need you
to take this seriously, okay?

43:56.551 --> 43:58.224
This is the last time we're
gonna see each other, until...

43:58.386 --> 43:59.854
Until when?

44:00.388 --> 44:01.731
Until it's safe.

44:01.889 --> 44:03.357
You were going
to get a divorce.

44:03.516 --> 44:05.564
Never say that
out loud again.

44:05.726 --> 44:08.400
Okay. I'm sorry.

44:09.188 --> 44:10.235
I don't wanna fight.

44:12.275 --> 44:13.743
I just wanna be with you.

44:13.901 --> 44:15.073
Andie, oh, please...

44:15.903 --> 44:17.576
That's all I want.

44:18.906 --> 44:19.998
I can't.

44:22.326 --> 44:24.454
It's our last time together.

44:24.620 --> 44:26.668
Let's make the most of it.

44:33.421 --> 44:36.766
Real quick,
but then you have to go.

44:39.594 --> 44:42.268
<i>My husband
has come undone.</i>

44:42.430 --> 44:45.274
<i>We moved to Missouri
to save Maureen...</i>

44:45.433 --> 44:48.152
<i>but as it turns out,
we couldn't.</i>

44:51.439 --> 44:53.191
It means a lot
that you came.

44:54.358 --> 44:55.679
<i>We took a hit on
the brownstone...</i>

44:55.776 --> 44:58.120
<i>and I used the last of my
trust fund to buy him a bar.</i>

44:58.863 --> 45:01.116
<i>So far,
it's just costing money.</i>

45:05.328 --> 45:09.128
<i>Nick uses me for sex when he wants.</i>

45:12.293 --> 45:14.796
<i>- Otherwise, I don't exist.
- Whoo!</i>

45:16.047 --> 45:18.015
We should go to
Outback tonight.

45:18.174 --> 45:19.300
That would be nice.

45:19.467 --> 45:22.562
<i>Last night, I went
from desperate to pathetic.</i>

45:23.471 --> 45:26.520
<i>I became someone
I don't even like.</i>

45:26.682 --> 45:28.480
<i>The kind of woman
I used to mock.</i>

45:28.893 --> 45:30.486
You're out so much.

45:30.645 --> 45:32.864
- I know.
- Stay home.

45:33.022 --> 45:35.241
- I can't, I'm already late.
- Then, can I come?

45:35.399 --> 45:37.072
You would hate it.

45:37.235 --> 45:40.489
It's a bunch of my dorky
high school friends.

45:41.489 --> 45:44.368
Do our code.
No bullshit.

45:44.825 --> 45:47.203
I thought we weren't
gonna be that couple.

45:53.709 --> 45:55.552
Okay, bye.

45:57.213 --> 46:00.057
- Hey, I've been thinking.
- Yeah?

46:00.216 --> 46:01.593
Something positive.

46:03.010 --> 46:04.057
Maybe it's time.

46:05.346 --> 46:07.064
Now is literally
the worst time.

46:07.223 --> 46:08.423
It would be
a new start for us.

46:08.683 --> 46:11.277
And for me, I would have
a real purpose here.

46:11.435 --> 46:12.527
A child is not a hobby.

46:12.687 --> 46:13.688
Not a hobby.

46:14.689 --> 46:15.906
An inspiration.

46:16.440 --> 46:19.444
We could have had this fight
four hours ago. I'm late.

46:19.610 --> 46:20.736
I didn't know it was
gonna be a fight.

46:20.903 --> 46:22.621
You really wanna be the
couple that has a baby...

46:22.697 --> 46:24.199
to save their marriage?

46:24.365 --> 46:25.366
"Save"?

46:25.866 --> 46:27.914
Reboot, retool,
rekindle, whatever!

46:28.077 --> 46:30.125
And you're gonna walk
out the door now? Yeah!

46:30.288 --> 46:32.711
You're a fucking coward.

46:32.873 --> 46:34.625
No, it can't
go on like this.

46:34.792 --> 46:35.793
Oh, really?

46:35.876 --> 46:37.253
- I won't.
- You won't?

46:37.420 --> 46:39.639
You won't? Why, it's not
good enough for you?

46:39.714 --> 46:40.714
It's not even close!

46:40.756 --> 46:42.884
You stupid bitch!

46:43.467 --> 46:46.311
<i>What scared me
wasn't that he'd pushed me.</i>

46:46.470 --> 46:50.316
<i>What scared me was how much
he wanted to hurt me more.</i>

46:50.641 --> 46:52.735
<i>What scared me was
that I'd finally realized...</i>

46:53.728 --> 46:57.403
<i>I am frightened
of my own husband.</i>

47:09.285 --> 47:10.662
You want me to
call for backup?

47:10.828 --> 47:12.922
Nah, I'll protect you.

47:20.671 --> 47:22.093
Jesus.

47:27.136 --> 47:29.810
They ought to burn
this place down.

47:30.264 --> 47:31.937
Seems like
folks are trying.

47:37.438 --> 47:39.611
You really think
this is anything?

47:39.774 --> 47:41.947
Cross it off the list.

47:53.037 --> 47:54.630
Hey, Jason.

47:54.789 --> 47:56.211
What's up, Rhonda?

47:56.374 --> 47:58.627
"...and dedicated to the
proposition that all men..."

47:59.710 --> 48:01.132
Have you seen this
girl around here?

48:01.212 --> 48:02.213
Why do you ask?

48:02.463 --> 48:04.306
She was reported missing.

48:07.468 --> 48:09.220
"...and so dedicated,
can long endure."

48:09.387 --> 48:11.185
Yeah. I remember her.

48:11.347 --> 48:13.475
What did she want?
Weed, pills?

48:15.142 --> 48:16.143
She wanted a gun.

48:16.394 --> 48:18.317
I told her
it's not my thing.

48:18.479 --> 48:21.358
I felt bad, though.
She seemed really desperate.

48:21.524 --> 48:22.696
She said it needed
to be small...

48:22.775 --> 48:24.994
so she could
keep it close.

48:25.152 --> 48:26.870
Are you sure
this is her?

48:27.029 --> 48:29.157
You don't forget a girl
like that in here.

48:30.157 --> 48:31.534
She was all in pink.

48:31.700 --> 48:34.249
It was Valentine's Day.

48:37.206 --> 48:39.834
<i>For Valentine's Day,
I thought I'd buy a gun.</i>

48:40.000 --> 48:42.594
<i>That is how crazy
I've become.</i>

48:43.671 --> 48:47.676
<i>Nick wants me gone but he
won't ask for a divorce.</i>

48:47.842 --> 48:51.847
<i>In his mind, I'm the owner of his
bar, his only line of credit.</i>

48:52.012 --> 48:53.514
<i>The bitch with the prenup.</i>

48:55.349 --> 48:57.568
<i>I could go home
to my parents...</i>

48:57.726 --> 49:00.024
<i>but I'd have to
tell them the truth.</i>

49:00.187 --> 49:03.908
<i>And I don't even know if I believe
the truth.</i>

49:04.066 --> 49:06.865
<i>Can I really think
Nick would hurt me?</i>

49:07.486 --> 49:09.864
<i>I'm being paranoid. Crazy.</i>

49:11.198 --> 49:12.495
<i>It's just...</i>

49:13.159 --> 49:15.708
<i>I'd sleep better
with a gun.</i>

49:26.589 --> 49:27.886
Oh, shit.

49:28.048 --> 49:31.678
Wake up, baby.
My sister's gonna come out here.

49:36.056 --> 49:38.275
Sorry to rush you.
It's okay.

49:40.227 --> 49:41.570
Here. Let me help you.
Okay.

49:41.770 --> 49:43.864
Just get that.

49:46.525 --> 49:48.027
Be very careful.

49:48.736 --> 49:49.737
I'm all right.

49:49.904 --> 49:52.373
Here you go.

49:52.531 --> 49:54.283
Promise me
we'll talk every day.

49:54.450 --> 49:55.576
Okay, we will.

49:55.743 --> 49:58.462
Every day, Nick,
or I'll go crazy.

49:59.205 --> 50:00.206
Don't go crazy.

50:00.372 --> 50:01.624
Okay-

50:06.045 --> 50:09.265
You fucking idiot.

50:09.423 --> 50:13.269
You fucking asshole! You fucking
lied to my fucking face!

50:14.762 --> 50:16.890
I'm sorry.

50:18.015 --> 50:19.062
How old is she?

50:19.433 --> 50:20.650
She's in her early 20s.

50:21.393 --> 50:22.394
How long?

50:23.103 --> 50:24.104
A year and a half.

50:24.188 --> 50:25.781
You lied to me
for over a year?

50:25.940 --> 50:27.487
Oh, if I told you, you
would have made me stop.

50:27.650 --> 50:29.118
It's so fucking small.

50:29.276 --> 50:32.120
You're a liar and a cheat!
You're just like Dad!

50:32.279 --> 50:33.451
How did you
even meet her?

50:33.614 --> 50:34.831
She's one of my students.

50:36.075 --> 50:38.498
- I thought writers hated cliches.
- Oh, I'm not a writer.

50:38.661 --> 50:40.789
"Oh, boo-hoo, I got laid off.
I guess I'll fuck a teenager."

50:40.955 --> 50:43.629
It wasn't like that, okay? You have
no idea how shitty it was with Amy...

50:43.791 --> 50:45.589
how fucking terrible
she made me feel.

50:45.751 --> 50:48.800
Flyover Boy. I would get
knots in my stomach...

50:48.963 --> 50:50.681
just coming home, knowing she
would be sitting there...

50:50.839 --> 50:53.000
dissatisfied, before I even
walked in the fucking door.

50:53.008 --> 50:54.305
This is so bad.

50:54.468 --> 50:56.436
If anybody finds out,
you're totally fucked.

50:56.595 --> 50:59.098
Boney found a pair of panties
in my office...

50:59.265 --> 51:00.812
where, occasionally,
Andie and I...

51:01.267 --> 51:02.268
I don't know what
the fuck it means.

51:02.434 --> 51:03.481
<i>Are they Super-Twat's?</i>

51:03.644 --> 51:05.612
Her name is Andie.

51:05.771 --> 51:07.148
She's not entirely sure.

51:07.314 --> 51:08.861
So we are dealing
with a 20-year-old...

51:09.024 --> 51:10.321
who isn't sure where
she leaves her undies?

51:10.484 --> 51:12.685
If they're not Andie's, that
means that they're Amy's...

51:12.778 --> 51:14.371
and she left them
there for me to find.

51:14.530 --> 51:16.328
Nick, I was scared
for you before...

51:16.407 --> 51:18.159
and now,
I'm fucking petrified.

51:18.325 --> 51:20.498
We're having a vigil tonight
for your missing wife...

51:20.661 --> 51:23.665
and this morning, you're kissing
your college girlfriend goodbye!

51:23.831 --> 51:25.003
Can you imagine?

51:25.624 --> 51:28.844
Have you watched
television lately?

51:29.003 --> 51:32.007
Cable news is
all over your shit.

51:32.631 --> 51:35.180
<i>I mean, what is wrong
with this barkeep?</i>

51:35.259 --> 51:36.761
<i>His wife's nowhere
to be found...</i>

51:36.844 --> 51:39.267
<i>and here's Nick Dunne
for you, flirting.</i>

51:39.346 --> 51:40.393
<i>Cute pic, huh?</i>

51:40.556 --> 51:41.603
Who is that?

51:41.682 --> 51:42.899
Some fucking
tragedy groupie.

51:43.058 --> 51:44.856
- Who the fuck is that?
- I don't know.

51:45.019 --> 51:46.020
She was trying to
give me a casserole.

51:46.186 --> 51:49.190
<i>On the show today we have defense
attorney, Tanner Bolt...</i>

51:49.356 --> 51:51.905
<i>patron saint to wife-killers everywhere...</i>

51:52.192 --> 51:55.571
<i>Tanner Bolt, would you actually
consider defending Nick Dunne?</i>

51:55.738 --> 51:56.739
<i>Well, let me just say...</i>

51:56.905 --> 51:59.533
<i>as always, Ellen, thank you
for such a warm welcome.</i>

51:59.700 --> 52:01.247
<i>But of course,
I'd defend Nick Dunne.</i>

52:01.535 --> 52:03.975
<i>Listen, just because this guy
isn't walking around weeping...</i>

52:04.079 --> 52:05.376
<i>that doesn't mean
that he's not hurting.</i>

52:05.539 --> 52:08.759
<i>Tanner, the hallmark of a
sociopath is a lack of empathy.</i>

52:08.917 --> 52:11.198
<i>But the truth is, you'd
have to be a sociopath...</i>

52:11.378 --> 52:13.051
<i>to behave normally
in this situation...</i>

52:13.213 --> 52:15.841
<i>because it's the most abnormal
situation in the world.</i>

52:16.008 --> 52:18.557
<i>Tanner, are you trying
to tell me that this photo...</i>

52:18.719 --> 52:20.847
<i>is remotely in the realm
of acceptable behavior?</i>

52:21.013 --> 52:23.687
I'm so sick of being
picked apart by women.

52:25.059 --> 52:26.936
You need to
hire Tanner Bolt.

52:28.687 --> 52:29.688
I don't deserve this.

52:29.855 --> 52:31.607
<i>Innocent until proven guilty.</i>

52:31.774 --> 52:34.027
That's exactly
what you deserve.

52:34.193 --> 52:35.740
Go home, Nick.

53:01.720 --> 53:03.142
Hey, buddy.

53:19.029 --> 53:20.789
I can't believe
we haven't arrested this guy.

53:20.864 --> 53:22.707
We're not gonna
arrest anybody...

53:22.866 --> 53:24.386
just because some
blonde dunce says so.

53:24.785 --> 53:27.288
Why are you going so easy on him?
You got a crush?

53:27.579 --> 53:30.799
One, I am conducting an
investigation, not a witch-hunt.

53:30.958 --> 53:32.756
And, two, don't talk
to me that way, ever.

53:32.918 --> 53:34.090
She was trying
to buy a gun.

53:34.253 --> 53:36.301
We don't know who
or what was scaring her, Gil.

53:36.380 --> 53:37.381
Give me the update.

53:37.965 --> 53:40.468
No drug angles panned out yet,
so cross that off the list.

53:40.634 --> 53:42.594
I talked to the nurses
who care for Nick's father.

53:42.636 --> 53:45.230
The guy's a bastard, but he's weak as
a kitten, so cross that off the list.

53:45.389 --> 53:46.436
- Hey.
- Hey.

53:46.598 --> 53:49.898
So, luminol lit up the kitchen
like the 4th of July.

53:50.060 --> 53:51.232
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

53:51.395 --> 53:52.396
The blood is profuse.

53:52.563 --> 53:54.657
It is Amy's, type B,
and we should have DNA soon.

53:54.732 --> 53:55.853
Thoughts on a weapon?

53:55.941 --> 53:57.739
Trajectory indicates blunt force.

53:57.901 --> 54:00.745
Maybe a club or a two-by-four.

54:00.821 --> 54:03.950
She fell there,
but I doubt she got back up.

54:04.116 --> 54:05.413
Amy's medical
records come in?

54:05.576 --> 54:07.578
No, we'll have them
later tonight.

54:09.163 --> 54:10.585
My wife says
he's a killer.

54:10.831 --> 54:13.175
Well, if Tiffany says...

54:38.776 --> 54:39.777
Hey-

54:40.110 --> 54:41.111
Hey-

54:45.532 --> 54:46.653
Thank you all
for coming out.

54:48.368 --> 54:49.870
Hey Donnie,
how are you?

54:50.037 --> 54:53.382
Rich, thank you so much.

55:00.672 --> 55:01.673
- Hey.
- Hmm.

55:08.722 --> 55:10.190
<i>Thank you, folks.</i>

55:10.265 --> 55:12.188
<i>Thank you for
being here tonight.</i>

55:12.351 --> 55:14.149
<i>It just means the world
to our family.</i>

55:14.686 --> 55:16.154
And to Amy.

55:16.730 --> 55:18.732
As you all know...

55:19.566 --> 55:22.740
my wife,
Amy Elliott Dunne...

55:22.903 --> 55:24.405
disappeared three days ago.

55:24.988 --> 55:28.413
And I want to implore anyone who
has any information at all...

55:28.575 --> 55:31.374
please come forward.
Help us.

55:31.537 --> 55:33.756
- So hot.
- Ew! He is so creepy.

55:33.914 --> 55:35.131
I wanna say something...

55:35.207 --> 55:37.255
because I think some of
you might be wondering...

55:37.417 --> 55:39.340
and are too polite to ask.

55:39.837 --> 55:42.932
I had nothing to do with the
disappearance of my wife.

55:43.507 --> 55:45.350
I'm cooperating
with the police.

55:45.509 --> 55:47.432
I haven't hired a lawyer.

55:47.594 --> 55:48.720
I have nothing to hide.

55:50.013 --> 55:52.516
Amy is my soul mate.

55:52.766 --> 55:54.063
She is brilliant...

55:54.601 --> 55:57.696
she's charming,
and wise.

55:58.021 --> 55:59.739
I love you, Amy.

56:03.861 --> 56:04.953
Asshole.

56:06.280 --> 56:08.203
I love my wife...

56:08.574 --> 56:09.791
so much.

56:12.286 --> 56:16.632
And I may not behave for the
cameras the way they want me to...

56:17.040 --> 56:20.135
and if they wanna punish
me for that, that's okay.

56:20.294 --> 56:23.889
But I just wanna ask you in the
media, please, harass me...

56:24.047 --> 56:26.971
but don't harass the people of this town.

56:27.134 --> 56:29.057
If you need to mock
somebody, mock me.

56:29.219 --> 56:30.311
Nick!

56:30.470 --> 56:32.631
But please don't turn this
investigation into a circus.

56:32.639 --> 56:34.107
Where's your wife, Nick?

56:34.266 --> 56:35.768
Let the police
do their jobs.

56:36.226 --> 56:37.819
What did you do to
your pregnant wife?

56:39.646 --> 56:40.772
Did you tell
them that, Nick?

56:40.939 --> 56:42.987
Did you tell them Amy
was six weeks pregnant?

56:46.737 --> 56:48.910
Thank you for your support tonight.
Let's find Amy.

56:51.074 --> 56:52.714
Go ahead, if you guys
wanna say something.

56:56.788 --> 56:58.165
Gil, go, go.

57:00.500 --> 57:01.501
Nick,
where are you going?

57:01.668 --> 57:03.136
Stop him!

57:03.295 --> 57:05.514
No questions right now.
Thank you.

57:08.008 --> 57:09.555
Why are you running away?

57:10.636 --> 57:12.058
Don't run.

57:13.138 --> 57:14.139
Everybody, stay back.

57:18.936 --> 57:20.984
Guys, come on.
You know better.

57:21.146 --> 57:23.490
Get off the grass,
get down to the curb.

57:23.649 --> 57:24.946
- Hey, Gil...
- On it.

57:25.025 --> 57:26.026
All right.

57:26.193 --> 57:27.945
All right, y'all heard her.
No pictures.

57:28.028 --> 57:29.325
Hello?

57:30.072 --> 57:31.415
Hello?

57:31.490 --> 57:32.490
Fuck.

57:32.532 --> 57:33.909
You scared me.
Want a drink?

57:34.076 --> 57:35.453
Did you know
she was pregnant?

57:35.619 --> 57:37.621
I told you, Noelle Hawthorne
is fucking crazy.

57:37.788 --> 57:38.835
She doesn't even know Amy.

57:39.498 --> 57:41.099
They look like pretty
good friends to me.

57:48.674 --> 57:50.392
Look, I don't know.

57:50.467 --> 57:51.969
But it certainly doesn't prove
that she's pregnant.

57:52.135 --> 57:53.227
We have her
medical records coming.

57:53.387 --> 57:55.139
- Good.
- So, let's talk while we wait.

57:55.305 --> 57:57.399
Let's start over here.
The scene of the crime.

57:57.557 --> 58:00.310
You see, we've seen dozens
of home invasions.

58:00.477 --> 58:02.320
Dozens and dozens.

58:02.479 --> 58:04.573
This area right here, it looked
wrong from the second we saw it.

58:04.731 --> 58:07.905
The whole thing looked staged.
Watch this.

58:09.820 --> 58:13.245
And yet, they remained upright
throughout this life-and-death struggle?

58:13.657 --> 58:15.284
I don't know. What do
you want me to say?

58:15.367 --> 58:17.040
Did you do any housekeeping the
day your wife went missing?

58:17.119 --> 58:20.248
- No.
- Because our guys did a luminol test.

58:20.414 --> 58:22.963
And I'm sorry to tell you,
but that kitchen lit up.

58:23.125 --> 58:25.253
Amy lost a lot of blood
in there, Nick. A lot.

58:25.335 --> 58:26.336
Oh, my God.

58:26.420 --> 58:27.637
Yeah, and then
somebody mopped it up.

58:27.796 --> 58:30.140
Oh... Wait a second. Why would
they mop up the blood...

58:30.298 --> 58:31.899
if they're trying to stage
a crime scene?

58:31.925 --> 58:34.553
No blood and no body
suggests kidnapping.

58:34.720 --> 58:37.018
It tells us, look at
people outside the house.

58:37.180 --> 58:38.477
Like these homeless
you keep mentioning.

58:38.640 --> 58:41.610
A pool of blood and no
body suggests homicide.

58:41.768 --> 58:43.645
It tells us to look at
people inside the house.

58:43.812 --> 58:45.314
Which is what
we're doing here, Nick.

58:45.397 --> 58:46.398
I see.

58:46.565 --> 58:48.192
So, how was
your marriage, Nick?

58:48.275 --> 58:49.401
Because right now,
all we got is Noelle.

58:49.568 --> 58:50.990
She says, "Not good."

58:51.153 --> 58:52.530
Gil, what do you
and your wife argue about?

58:52.696 --> 58:54.698
- What pisses you off?
- Oh, money, lack thereof.

58:54.865 --> 58:56.492
Me and my ex,
it's the same.

58:56.658 --> 58:59.878
I mention that because we got a
look at your finances, Nick.

59:00.037 --> 59:02.631
$117,000
in credit card debt.

59:02.789 --> 59:04.632
- What?
- I pulled up some of the merchandise.

59:04.791 --> 59:06.668
There are these
fun little splurges.

59:06.835 --> 59:08.275
I didn't buy
any of this stuff.

59:08.420 --> 59:09.421
I don't even golf!

59:09.588 --> 59:10.805
I do!
You bought great clubs.

59:10.964 --> 59:12.136
I like the robot dog.

59:12.299 --> 59:14.142
This is identity theft!
This is a felony!

59:14.217 --> 59:15.218
We need to find out
who did this!

59:15.302 --> 59:16.982
All right. Let's talk
about life insurance.

59:17.095 --> 59:19.518
Because in April, you bumped
up Amy's life insurance...

59:19.639 --> 59:20.640
to $1.2 million.

59:20.724 --> 59:22.977
Yes, I did. That was her idea.
She wanted me to.

59:23.143 --> 59:24.190
You filed the paperwork.

59:24.352 --> 59:25.729
- Because she told me to!
- Whoa!

59:25.812 --> 59:27.189
Hold on a sec.

59:27.355 --> 59:29.153
Yeah? Okay.

59:31.068 --> 59:32.240
For sure?

59:32.652 --> 59:33.824
All right.

59:37.824 --> 59:38.871
She was pregnant.

59:42.996 --> 59:44.498
This is insane.

59:44.664 --> 59:47.042
So, my question becomes...

59:47.209 --> 59:50.008
I don't want to talk
to you again, ever...

59:50.170 --> 59:51.342
without a lawyer.

59:59.679 --> 01:00:00.680
Margo!

01:00:11.566 --> 01:00:12.567
Hey-

01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:17.198
Just hold on a second.
Let me finish.

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.281
Nick?

01:00:18.365 --> 01:00:21.039
I hear you, I hear you.
I was as surprised as...

01:00:21.201 --> 01:00:25.047
I know you're upset. I had
no idea she was pregnant.

01:00:25.455 --> 01:00:28.584
Listen, I thought so, too,
but evidently that wasn't...

01:00:31.086 --> 01:00:33.088
You want to
know the truth?

01:00:33.255 --> 01:00:35.633
The truth is,
Amy didn't want kids.

01:00:38.051 --> 01:00:40.099
Well, I'm as surprised as...

01:00:41.429 --> 01:00:43.227
You told me
you didn't want kids.

01:00:43.598 --> 01:00:45.475
I was trying
to put a good face on.

01:00:45.642 --> 01:00:47.394
Then, suddenly,
you've got a pregnant wife.

01:00:47.561 --> 01:00:48.778
That's a problem for you.

01:00:48.937 --> 01:00:51.907
Especially when you factor in
the secret teenage girlfriend.

01:00:52.065 --> 01:00:53.408
Oh, stop watching
Ellen Abbott!

01:00:53.567 --> 01:00:54.910
You have to
fucking talk to me!

01:00:57.571 --> 01:00:59.915
I didn't tell you that
she didn't want kids...

01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:01.492
because she didn't
want me to.

01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:02.659
Because it would
have just been...

01:01:02.742 --> 01:01:03.743
another reason
for you to hate her.

01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:05.662
And we had enough of those already!
It was easier to just...

01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:07.923
- Lie to me?
- I wanted kids!

01:01:08.081 --> 01:01:10.242
When we first moved here,
I went to a fertility clinic!

01:01:10.292 --> 01:01:11.839
- It didn't work?
- I did my part!

01:01:11.918 --> 01:01:12.919
- Masturbate.
- When it came time...

01:01:13.003 --> 01:01:14.755
for Amy to do her thing,
all of a sudden it was like...

01:01:14.838 --> 01:01:16.399
"Well, I don't know.
Maybe. No, thanks."

01:01:16.423 --> 01:01:18.425
Now, who would believe you?

01:01:19.593 --> 01:01:20.810
All right.

01:01:30.437 --> 01:01:32.110
This is a letter
from the clinic...

01:01:32.272 --> 01:01:34.616
notifying me that they're
gonna destroy my sample...

01:01:34.774 --> 01:01:36.776
unless I contact them.

01:01:38.028 --> 01:01:39.450
So, I gave it to Amy.

01:01:39.613 --> 01:01:42.492
The next day,
I saw it in the trash.

01:01:42.657 --> 01:01:44.125
But you were already with
Andie by then, right?

01:01:44.284 --> 01:01:47.003
I wanted a baby with Amy.

01:01:47.162 --> 01:01:48.880
A year ago,
Amy being pregnant...

01:01:48.955 --> 01:01:51.333
would have been
the best thing ever!

01:01:57.881 --> 01:01:59.633
"When your poor Amy has a
cold, this dessert just..."

01:01:59.799 --> 01:02:01.199
This is the clue
you couldn't solve.

01:02:01.218 --> 01:02:02.344
Yeah.

01:02:04.054 --> 01:02:05.601
A letter from Desi.

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:07.307
That creepy boyfriend
of Amy's?

01:02:07.474 --> 01:02:09.755
It was the fucking rich guy who
would do anything for her.

01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:11.736
It just kept hanging over my head.
It was disgusting.

01:02:11.853 --> 01:02:12.854
Your prenup?

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:14.777
Nick, why have
you kept this stuff?

01:02:14.856 --> 01:02:16.073
It's like
a little box of hate.

01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:18.031
I don't know, Go!
Maybe I hate her!

01:02:20.904 --> 01:02:23.908
I love you no matter what.

01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:25.326
But you need to tell me.

01:02:25.492 --> 01:02:26.914
Tell you what?

01:02:27.744 --> 01:02:29.371
What are you asking me?

01:02:30.956 --> 01:02:34.130
Are you asking me
if I killed my wife, Go?

01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:36.664
Is that what you're asking me?
If I murdered my wife?

01:02:36.711 --> 01:02:39.134
I would never
ask you that!

01:02:43.093 --> 01:02:44.094
Margo!

01:02:56.898 --> 01:02:59.117
Don't walk on the glass.

01:02:59.484 --> 01:03:00.736
Oh.

01:03:00.819 --> 01:03:03.447
You have no clue,
do you?

01:03:21.256 --> 01:03:22.849
Why was he here that night?

01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:27.141
His wife is missing.
Why come here?

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:28.267
Who cares?

01:03:28.555 --> 01:03:29.681
Rhonda, we got this.

01:03:29.848 --> 01:03:31.225
Let's make the arrest.

01:03:31.391 --> 01:03:33.314
Do you know how hard it is to make
a murder case without a body?

01:03:33.393 --> 01:03:34.394
No.

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:36.525
Well, it's incredibly hard.

01:03:36.688 --> 01:03:39.441
So, I want one last thing.

01:03:39.524 --> 01:03:40.525
What's that?

01:03:42.235 --> 01:03:44.533
I want a body.

01:03:45.697 --> 01:03:49.998
<i>Picture me, I'm a
girl who's very, very bad.</i>

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.787
Be careful.

01:03:56.333 --> 01:04:00.759
<i>I need to be punished, and
by "punished," I mean "had."</i>

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:06.301
Fuck.

01:04:08.261 --> 01:04:11.105
<i>It's where you keep
goodies for anniversary five.</i>

01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:14.397
<i>So, open the door...</i>

01:04:14.559 --> 01:04:15.811
Punish. Wood. Beach.

01:04:15.977 --> 01:04:18.480
<i>...and look alive.</i>

01:04:21.608 --> 01:04:24.202
Punish. Wood.

01:04:25.362 --> 01:04:26.955
Wood.

01:04:59.062 --> 01:05:01.656
<i>I will practice believing
my husband loves me...</i>

01:05:01.815 --> 01:05:04.238
<i>and will love this baby.</i>

01:05:04.901 --> 01:05:08.531
<i>That this child might
really save our marriage.</i>

01:05:09.406 --> 01:05:10.874
<i>But I could be wrong.</i>

01:05:17.038 --> 01:05:18.961
<i>Because sometimes...</i>

01:05:19.958 --> 01:05:22.177
<i>the way he looks at</i> me...

01:05:23.253 --> 01:05:24.880
<i>I think...</i>

01:05:25.046 --> 01:05:26.138
<i>man of my dreams...</i>

01:05:28.049 --> 01:05:30.143
<i>father of my child...</i>

01:05:30.927 --> 01:05:34.932
<i>this man of mine
may kill me.</i>

01:05:36.307 --> 01:05:38.309
<i>He may truly...</i>

01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:39.982
<i>kill me.</i>

01:05:42.814 --> 01:05:43.815
WTF?

01:06:08.882 --> 01:06:11.476
<i>I am so much happier
now that I'm dead.</i>

01:06:16.514 --> 01:06:18.107
<i>Technically, "missing."</i>

01:06:18.933 --> 01:06:21.106
<i>Soon to be presumed dead.</i>

01:06:22.312 --> 01:06:23.438
<i>Gone.</i>

01:06:24.397 --> 01:06:27.526
<i>And my lazy, lying,
cheating, oblivious husband...</i>

01:06:27.692 --> 01:06:30.992
<i>will go to prison
for my murder.</i>

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:34.703
<i>Nick Dunne took my pride
and my dignity...</i>

01:06:34.866 --> 01:06:37.244
<i>and my hope and my money.</i>

01:06:37.410 --> 01:06:40.880
<i>He took and took from me
until I no longer existed.</i>

01:06:41.039 --> 01:06:42.336
<i>That's murder.</i>

01:06:42.499 --> 01:06:45.298
<i>Let the punishment
fit the crime.</i>

01:06:45.877 --> 01:06:48.881
<i>To fake a convincing murder,
you have to have discipline.</i>

01:06:53.092 --> 01:06:56.096
<i>You befriend a local idiot.</i>

01:06:59.641 --> 01:07:02.815
<i>Harvest the details
of her humdrum life.</i>

01:07:03.186 --> 01:07:06.781
<i>And cram her with stories about
your husband's violent temper.</i>

01:07:07.899 --> 01:07:10.197
<i>Secretly create
some money troubles.</i>

01:07:10.443 --> 01:07:13.617
<i>Credit cards,
perhaps online gambling.</i>

01:07:16.241 --> 01:07:18.335
<i>With the help of
the unwitting...</i>

01:07:18.493 --> 01:07:20.495
<i>bump up your life insurance.</i>

01:07:22.205 --> 01:07:25.254
<i>Purchase getaway car.
Craigslist.</i>

01:07:25.416 --> 01:07:28.716
<i>Generic. Cheap. Pay cash.</i>

01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:33.676
<i>You need to package yourself so that
people will truly mourn your loss.</i>

01:07:33.841 --> 01:07:36.811
<i>And America loves
pregnant women.</i>

01:07:37.136 --> 01:07:40.015
<i>As if it's so hard
to spread your legs.</i>

01:07:40.181 --> 01:07:41.478
<i>You know what's hard?</i>

01:07:41.975 --> 01:07:43.818
<i>Faking a pregnancy.</i>

01:07:43.977 --> 01:07:46.150
<i>First, drain your toilet.</i>

01:07:47.855 --> 01:07:50.483
<i>Invite pregnant idiot
into your home...</i>

01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:53.153
<i>and ply her with lemonade.</i>

01:07:58.324 --> 01:08:00.497
<i>Steal pregnant idiot's urine.</i>

01:08:02.704 --> 01:08:04.081
<i>Voilà.</i>

01:08:04.247 --> 01:08:08.218
<i>A pregnancy is now part
of your legal medical record.</i>

01:08:14.716 --> 01:08:16.059
<i>Happy anniversary.</i>

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:21.348
<i>Wait for your
clueless husband...</i>

01:08:21.514 --> 01:08:23.390
<i>to start his day.</i>

01:08:24.850 --> 01:08:26.194
<i>Off he goes.</i>

01:08:26.352 --> 01:08:28.524
<i>And the clock is ticking.</i>

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:32.192
<i>Meticulously stage
your crime scene...</i>

01:08:32.859 --> 01:08:36.863
<i>with just enough mistakes
to raise the specter of doubt.</i>

01:08:38.281 --> 01:08:40.249
<i>You need to bleed.</i>

01:08:40.366 --> 01:08:41.367
<i>A lot.</i>

01:08:42.201 --> 01:08:43.874
<i>A lot, a lot.</i>

01:08:47.206 --> 01:08:49.049
<i>A head wound kind of bleed.</i>

01:08:49.709 --> 01:08:52.212
<i>A crime scene kind of bleed.</i>

01:08:55.214 --> 01:08:58.218
<i>You need to clean poorly...
like he would.</i>

01:08:59.093 --> 01:09:01.595
<i>Clean and bleed.
Bleed and clean.</i>

01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:04.814
<i>And leave a little
something behind.</i>

01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:07.227
<i>A fire in July?</i>

01:09:08.770 --> 01:09:11.148
<i>And because you're you...
you don't stop there.</i>

01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:13.658
<i>You need a diary.</i>

01:09:13.816 --> 01:09:16.740
<i>Minimum, 300 entries
on the Nick and Amy story.</i>

01:09:17.403 --> 01:09:19.576
<i>Start with
the fairy tale early days.</i>

01:09:19.738 --> 01:09:21.912
<i>Those are true.
And they're crucial.</i>

01:09:22.075 --> 01:09:24.077
<i>You want Nick and Amy
to be likeable.</i>

01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:27.913
<i>After that, you in vent.
The spending.</i>

01:09:28.081 --> 01:09:29.754
<i>The abuse. The fear.</i>

01:09:29.916 --> 01:09:32.760
<i>The threat of violence.</i>

01:09:32.919 --> 01:09:34.886
<i>And Nick thought
he was the writer.</i>

01:09:35.587 --> 01:09:36.885
<i>Burn it just
the right amount.</i>

01:09:38.716 --> 01:09:40.593
<i>Make sure
the cops will find it.</i>

01:09:45.598 --> 01:09:48.647
<i>Finally, honor tradition with
a very special treasure hunt.</i>

01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:53.903
<i>And if I get everything right,
the world will hate Nick...</i>

01:09:54.064 --> 01:09:56.659
<i>for killing his beautiful,
pregnant wife.</i>

01:09:56.818 --> 01:09:59.321
<i>And after all the outrage,
when I'm ready...</i>

01:09:59.487 --> 01:10:01.487
<i>I'll go out on the water
with a handful of pills...</i>

01:10:01.489 --> 01:10:03.912
<i>and a pocket full of stones.</i>

01:10:04.075 --> 01:10:06.749
<i>And when they find my body,
they'll know...</i>

01:10:06.911 --> 01:10:10.085
<i>Nick Dunne dumped
his beloved like garbage.</i>

01:10:10.248 --> 01:10:12.467
<i>And she floated down
past all the other...</i>

01:10:12.625 --> 01:10:15.970
<i>abused, unwanted,
inconvenient women.</i>

01:10:17.338 --> 01:10:19.306
<i>Then, Nick will die, too.</i>

01:10:20.174 --> 01:10:21.926
<i>Nick and Amy will be gone.</i>

01:10:22.093 --> 01:10:24.095
<i>But, then,
we never really existed.</i>

01:10:24.262 --> 01:10:27.357
<i>Nick loved a girl
I was pretending to be.</i>

01:10:27.515 --> 01:10:28.641
<i>"Cool Girl."</i>

01:10:28.975 --> 01:10:32.696
<i>Men always use that
as their defining compliment.</i>

01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:33.771
<i>"She's a cool girl."</i>

01:10:34.981 --> 01:10:35.982
<i>Cool Girl is hot.</i>

01:10:36.149 --> 01:10:37.401
<i>Cool Girl is game.</i>

01:10:37.483 --> 01:10:38.530
<i>Cool Girl is fun.</i>

01:10:38.943 --> 01:10:41.321
<i>Cool Girl never
gets angry at her man.</i>

01:10:41.487 --> 01:10:44.115
<i>She only smiles in a
chagrined, loving manner...</i>

01:10:44.782 --> 01:10:47.626
<i>and then presents
her mouth for fucking.</i>

01:10:47.785 --> 01:10:49.662
<i>She likes what he likes.</i>

01:10:49.829 --> 01:10:53.299
<i>So evidently, he's a vinyl
hipster who loves fetish manga.</i>

01:10:54.333 --> 01:10:57.507
<i>If he likes Girls Gone Wild,
she's a mall babe...</i>

01:10:57.670 --> 01:11:01.345
<i>who talks football and endures
buffalo wings at Hooters.</i>

01:11:01.507 --> 01:11:04.977
<i>When I met Nick Dunne,
I knew he wanted Cool Girl.</i>

01:11:05.136 --> 01:11:07.685
<i>And for him, I'll admit,
I was willing to try.</i>

01:11:07.847 --> 01:11:09.849
<i>I wax-stripped
my pussy raw.</i>

01:11:10.516 --> 01:11:13.645
<i>I drank canned beer
watching Adam Sandier movies.</i>

01:11:13.895 --> 01:11:16.523
<i>I ate cold pizza
and remained a size two.</i>

01:11:16.731 --> 01:11:18.699
<i>I blew him semi-regularly.</i>

01:11:20.026 --> 01:11:21.369
<i>I lived in the moment.</i>

01:11:21.652 --> 01:11:24.201
<i>I was fucking game.</i>

01:11:24.822 --> 01:11:26.870
<i>I can't say
I didn't enjoy some of it.</i>

01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:30.874
<i>Nick teased out of me
things I didn't know existed.</i>

01:11:31.037 --> 01:11:34.211
<i>A lightness,
a humor, an ease.</i>

01:11:34.373 --> 01:11:37.172
<i>But I made him smarter.
Sharper.</i>

01:11:37.335 --> 01:11:40.839
<i>I inspired him to
rise to my level.</i>

01:11:41.005 --> 01:11:44.760
<i>I forged the man
of my dreams.</i>

01:11:47.094 --> 01:11:49.893
<i>We were happy pretending
to be other people.</i>

01:11:50.056 --> 01:11:51.899
<i>We were the happiest
couple we knew.</i>

01:11:53.518 --> 01:11:56.522
<i>And what's the point of being
together if you're not the happiest?</i>

01:11:57.188 --> 01:11:59.282
<i>But Nick got</i> lazy.

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:01.534
<i>He became someone
I did not agree to marry.</i>

01:12:01.692 --> 01:12:04.866
<i>He actually expected me
to love him unconditionally.</i>

01:12:05.530 --> 01:12:09.910
<i>Then he dragged me, penniless, to
the navel of this great country...</i>

01:12:10.076 --> 01:12:13.922
<i>and found himself a newer,
younger, bouncier...</i>

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:15.081
<i>Cool Girl.</i>

01:12:17.416 --> 01:12:21.592
<i>You think I'd let him destroy me
and end up happier than ever?</i>

01:12:22.088 --> 01:12:23.761
<i>No fucking way.</i>

01:12:24.131 --> 01:12:25.929
<i>He doesn't get to win.</i>

01:12:36.269 --> 01:12:40.240
<i>My cute, charming,
salt-of-the-earth, Missouri guy.</i>

01:12:42.650 --> 01:12:45.119
He needed to learn.

01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:48.448
<i>Grown-ups work for things.</i>

01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:50.958
<i>Grown-ups pay-</i>

01:12:52.326 --> 01:12:54.920
<i>Grown-ups suffer consequences.</i>

01:12:58.416 --> 01:12:59.633
Wait.

01:13:00.001 --> 01:13:02.675
I need 20 seconds where you
don't judge me, interrupt me...

01:13:02.837 --> 01:13:04.464
or get angry.

01:13:05.923 --> 01:13:07.470
Okay-

01:13:11.429 --> 01:13:13.272
Is that all the stuff
from the credit cards?

01:13:13.431 --> 01:13:16.230
Where do you store goodies
for anniversary five?

01:13:16.309 --> 01:13:17.310
Wood.

01:13:17.476 --> 01:13:18.477
<i>Woodshed.</i>

01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:20.484
Yeah, my woodshed.

01:13:20.646 --> 01:13:23.149
That fucking bitch.

01:13:24.984 --> 01:13:26.224
- I thought...
- It's all right.

01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:27.828
I would have, too.

01:13:31.282 --> 01:13:32.374
What's that present?

01:13:32.533 --> 01:13:34.160
I don't know.

01:13:34.327 --> 01:13:36.295
Let's find out.

01:13:42.877 --> 01:13:44.254
"Dear Husband..."

01:13:44.337 --> 01:13:46.760
"I know you think you're moving
through this world unseen."

01:13:46.839 --> 01:13:48.160
"Don't believe
that for a second."

01:13:48.299 --> 01:13:50.580
"I know where you've been, and
I know where you're going."

01:13:53.804 --> 01:13:55.727
"For this anniversary,
I've arranged a trip."

01:13:55.890 --> 01:13:57.642
"Follow the river,
up, up, up."

01:13:57.808 --> 01:14:00.402
"Sit back and relax,
because you are done."

01:14:00.561 --> 01:14:01.858
What's "up, up river"?

01:14:02.021 --> 01:14:04.023
"Up the river." Prison.

01:14:04.231 --> 01:14:06.029
Fucking crazy bitch.

01:14:06.192 --> 01:14:07.694
That's what this is.

01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:10.033
She's framing me
for her murder.

01:14:10.196 --> 01:14:11.517
You married
a complete psychopath.

01:14:11.530 --> 01:14:13.498
The morning of
our anniversary...

01:14:13.699 --> 01:14:17.875
I was gonna ask her for a divorce.
I just couldn't do it.

01:14:18.037 --> 01:14:20.381
I couldn't fake it for
another year, another day.

01:14:20.539 --> 01:14:21.586
Then what happened?

01:14:21.666 --> 01:14:22.758
Before I could say anything,
she said...

01:14:22.833 --> 01:14:26.087
"I need you to go somewhere and
really think about our marriage."

01:14:26.253 --> 01:14:27.379
She knew I would
go to Sawyer Beach.

01:14:27.546 --> 01:14:28.718
So you'd have no alibi.

01:14:28.881 --> 01:14:31.100
She stage-managed me.

01:14:31.384 --> 01:14:34.934
She knew exactly what I would do.
And I fucking did it.

01:14:35.096 --> 01:14:36.518
I went to the beach,
I thought about our marriage.

01:14:36.681 --> 01:14:38.361
I came back and decided
I wanted a divorce.

01:14:38.432 --> 01:14:39.632
And by the time
you got home...

01:14:39.684 --> 01:14:41.231
She was gone.

01:14:41.602 --> 01:14:42.603
Oh, you fuck!

01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:44.363
She's good.

01:14:45.356 --> 01:14:47.233
Part of me was relieved...

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.698
when I thought
she was gone.

01:14:54.073 --> 01:14:55.791
Punch and Judy puppets.

01:14:58.786 --> 01:15:01.756
Remember, he beats Judy to
death and kills that baby.

01:15:01.914 --> 01:15:03.040
So I'm Punch.

01:15:04.041 --> 01:15:06.043
We already knew that, Amy,
what's your point?

01:15:07.211 --> 01:15:10.055
Does Missouri have
the death penalty?

01:15:36.949 --> 01:15:38.371
Hey, neighbor.

01:15:39.285 --> 01:15:41.663
It's been weeks since I had
anyone decent next door.

01:15:42.288 --> 01:15:44.791
Well, I don't know
how decent I feel.

01:15:44.957 --> 01:15:46.425
Well, as long as you
don't own a python...

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:47.968
and blast death metal
at 4 AM...

01:15:48.127 --> 01:15:50.004
we're gonna be best friends.

01:15:50.171 --> 01:15:52.139
All right.
Nice meeting you.

01:15:52.298 --> 01:15:53.891
I'm Greta.

01:15:54.508 --> 01:15:55.680
I'm Nancy.

01:15:55.843 --> 01:15:57.686
Are you going to the marina?
I could use some creamer.

01:15:57.845 --> 01:15:59.142
Oh, I'm sorry.
I can't.

01:15:59.305 --> 01:16:00.522
I've got work to do.

01:16:00.806 --> 01:16:02.854
All right.
See you around!

01:16:03.142 --> 01:16:05.065
You Will.

01:16:51.023 --> 01:16:56.245
Come on. Show me that
darling Nicky smile.

01:16:58.030 --> 01:16:59.907
You asshole.

01:17:15.381 --> 01:17:16.883
Hey-

01:17:19.677 --> 01:17:21.429
Nancy.

01:17:23.722 --> 01:17:25.565
Nancy.

01:17:26.559 --> 01:17:28.778
It's hot again today.

01:17:31.063 --> 01:17:32.906
So, uh,
where are you from?

01:17:33.399 --> 01:17:34.571
Let me guess.

01:17:37.486 --> 01:17:38.533
Nebraska.

01:17:40.906 --> 01:17:42.123
New Orleans.

01:17:45.578 --> 01:17:47.956
You know,
I am an expert oiler.

01:17:48.122 --> 01:17:49.795
Oh, I just bet you are.

01:17:49.957 --> 01:17:52.585
Lotions and balms.
Ointment.

01:17:53.294 --> 01:17:55.092
I would hate
for y'all to get tan lines.

01:17:55.254 --> 01:17:57.256
So sweet.

01:17:58.090 --> 01:18:00.764
Okay.
You know where I'll be.

01:18:03.637 --> 01:18:06.060
I see we have
the same taste in men.

01:18:07.766 --> 01:18:09.894
I clipped it on
a bathroom cabinet.

01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:13.109
Least you could do is not
keep his secrets for him.

01:18:14.148 --> 01:18:15.400
Let me guess.

01:18:15.566 --> 01:18:19.446
He's trying to watch the big
game and you just won't shut up.

01:18:19.737 --> 01:18:22.456
No, you don't seem
like much of a talker.

01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:23.532
Oh, I got it.

01:18:23.616 --> 01:18:25.960
You caught your boy rubbing up
on some hot little skank...

01:18:26.118 --> 01:18:28.118
and he apologized to you
by busting you a good one.

01:18:30.289 --> 01:18:31.290
Worse.

01:18:31.624 --> 01:18:32.625
Worse?

01:18:33.459 --> 01:18:37.054
I went to the bar where
he works to surprise him.

01:18:37.213 --> 01:18:39.432
<i>And out he comes
with this girl</i>

01:18:39.506 --> 01:18:41.929
<i>who had no business
being in a bar.</i>

01:18:44.887 --> 01:18:46.889
<i>On the very first
night that we met...</i>

01:18:47.139 --> 01:18:51.315
<i>we walked by a bakery that was
having their sugar delivered.</i>

01:18:52.144 --> 01:18:54.397
<i>And it was in the air,
everywhere.</i>

01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:56.736
<i>A sugar storm.</i>

01:18:56.899 --> 01:18:58.901
<i>And before he kissed me...</i>

01:18:59.068 --> 01:19:01.162
he leaned in...

01:19:02.655 --> 01:19:04.953
<i>and did this.</i>

01:19:15.626 --> 01:19:16.626
<i>And guess what.</i>

01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:17.795
<i>What?</i>

01:19:18.128 --> 01:19:19.846
He did the exact
same thing with her.

01:19:24.093 --> 01:19:26.972
That is the most disgusting
thing I ever heard.

01:19:27.137 --> 01:19:28.855
Thank you.

01:19:29.765 --> 01:19:30.766
Wow.

01:19:44.154 --> 01:19:45.201
Thanks very much.

01:19:51.996 --> 01:19:54.294
Well, we've gone mainstream.

01:20:09.888 --> 01:20:12.892
It's an appeals process, so we
will attempt to appeal to them.

01:20:13.058 --> 01:20:15.186
Mr. Bolt.
Tanner Bolt?

01:20:17.062 --> 01:20:18.359
Nick Dunne.

01:20:18.522 --> 01:20:20.820
I have been sitting by
the phone, my friend.

01:20:24.278 --> 01:20:25.404
I'm sorry.

01:20:25.571 --> 01:20:27.289
Do you not believe me?

01:20:27.448 --> 01:20:30.577
No, I believe you. It's just the
craziest thing I've ever heard.

01:20:30.743 --> 01:20:34.088
I love it.
But, for you, it sucks.

01:20:34.788 --> 01:20:36.349
But you gotta have
a grudging respect...

01:20:36.415 --> 01:20:37.962
for your wife at
this point, right?

01:20:38.125 --> 01:20:39.593
Are you laughing me out
of the building? No!

01:20:39.752 --> 01:20:41.379
Are you kidding me?
I'm in.

01:20:41.545 --> 01:20:42.888
I'm way in.

01:20:43.047 --> 01:20:45.550
You came to the right guy.
This is what I do, Nick.

01:20:45.716 --> 01:20:49.016
This is why I have a $100,000 retainer.
I win the unwinnable cases.

01:20:49.178 --> 01:20:50.725
$100,000?

01:20:50.888 --> 01:20:52.310
We'll figure something out.

01:20:52.431 --> 01:20:53.471
I'll give you a special...

01:20:53.515 --> 01:20:56.314
"my wife is skilled in the
art of vengeance" rate.

01:20:56.477 --> 01:20:57.478
Okay-

01:20:57.561 --> 01:20:59.063
So, what's the plan?

01:20:59.229 --> 01:21:00.981
Well, right now,
it's a "he said, she said."

01:21:01.148 --> 01:21:02.149
She's telling a better story.

01:21:02.232 --> 01:21:03.484
No, Nick.

01:21:03.650 --> 01:21:05.493
She is telling
the perfect story.

01:21:05.778 --> 01:21:08.952
So, we need to start today to prepare
your defense, should we need it.

01:21:09.114 --> 01:21:10.366
And if we decide to go
with your version of...

01:21:10.449 --> 01:21:11.496
The truth.

01:21:12.409 --> 01:21:15.583
Then we'll need to realign the
public's perception of Amy.

01:21:15.788 --> 01:21:17.916
Make them stop seeing her
as America's sweetheart...

01:21:18.082 --> 01:21:19.299
and see her
for what she is...

01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:21.423
which a mind-fucker
of the first degree.

01:21:21.835 --> 01:21:23.712
Now, that is
a huge realignment.

01:21:23.796 --> 01:21:25.673
We'll need other
voices besides yours.

01:21:25.839 --> 01:21:26.886
There has to be
someone out there...

01:21:26.965 --> 01:21:27.966
that she's screwed
with in the past.

01:21:28.133 --> 01:21:29.555
There's a New York guy.

01:21:29.635 --> 01:21:31.103
O'Hara, Tommy O'Hara.

01:21:31.261 --> 01:21:32.261
Eight years ago...

01:21:32.304 --> 01:21:33.544
she pressed
charges against him.

01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:35.853
That should be
easy to find.

01:21:36.392 --> 01:21:39.646
Um, ex-classmate,
Desi Collings.

01:21:39.812 --> 01:21:41.692
She said that he stalked her.
He's in St. Louis.

01:21:42.981 --> 01:21:45.234
You go talk to Tommy,
and I'll draw up the contract.

01:21:49.530 --> 01:21:52.534
I told you,
you came to the right guy.

01:21:54.743 --> 01:21:55.960
Apparently.

01:22:05.003 --> 01:22:06.676
Tommy?

01:22:06.839 --> 01:22:08.386
Yeah.

01:22:08.799 --> 01:22:10.767
- Thanks for seeing me.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:22:13.011 --> 01:22:15.560
Urn, you're gonna
want a drink.

01:22:16.098 --> 01:22:17.315
Yeah.

01:22:17.474 --> 01:22:20.148
<i>So, she said you
got physical with her.</i>

01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:23.154
No, dude,
she said I raped her.

01:22:23.313 --> 01:22:25.691
First degree, felony rape.

01:22:26.442 --> 01:22:28.115
- Did you do it?
- Did you do it?

01:22:28.193 --> 01:22:29.240
Yeah.

01:22:29.319 --> 01:22:31.413
I was looking at
30 years to life.

01:22:31.947 --> 01:22:33.369
- Did you get a trial?
- Fuck, no.

01:22:33.532 --> 01:22:35.626
Do I look like I would
do well in the yard?

01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:38.708
I pled down, man. Sexual
assault one, no jail time.

01:22:39.121 --> 01:22:40.668
- That's something.
- Oh, yeah.

01:22:40.831 --> 01:22:42.128
I've been unemployed
for the last eight years...

01:22:42.291 --> 01:22:44.669
because I have to write "sexual
offender" on every job application.

01:22:44.835 --> 01:22:46.196
I'm on
a neighborhood watch list...

01:22:46.295 --> 01:22:47.672
because I have to
register as a predator.

01:22:47.838 --> 01:22:49.478
I haven't had a date
in almost a decade...

01:22:49.506 --> 01:22:51.179
because if
a girl googles me...

01:22:53.135 --> 01:22:55.058
Could you walk me
through what happened?

01:22:55.345 --> 01:22:58.349
I meet Amy at
this party, you know?

01:22:58.515 --> 01:23:00.017
We click. She's perfect.

01:23:00.184 --> 01:23:02.403
She's beautiful, she's
smart, she's well-read...

01:23:02.561 --> 01:23:04.734
she's got an ass
like a 20-year-old stripper.

01:23:04.897 --> 01:23:06.570
I think,
"What's the catch?"

01:23:06.732 --> 01:23:09.906
A few months, it hits me.
This is not going to be easy.

01:23:10.569 --> 01:23:13.493
Girls like a fixer-upper,
but Amy?

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:17.000
She annexed me.
She made me her business.

01:23:17.159 --> 01:23:20.834
It was just too much. She
went out and bought me ties.

01:23:20.996 --> 01:23:23.090
And we must have gone
20 rounds over that.

01:23:23.248 --> 01:23:25.876
Ties. The whole thing
just became...

01:23:26.043 --> 01:23:27.340
So, you broke up with her.

01:23:27.419 --> 01:23:29.717
No, I just backed away.

01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:32.554
Gave her some space.
No big deal, right?

01:23:32.716 --> 01:23:34.263
So I thought.

01:23:34.426 --> 01:23:36.599
Then one night, Amy comes
over to my place...

01:23:36.762 --> 01:23:39.561
with a bottle of bourbon and a
bootleg of this band I love.

01:23:39.723 --> 01:23:42.602
And within two minutes, she's got
my pants around my ankles...

01:23:42.768 --> 01:23:44.236
and she is
kneeling down, and...

01:23:44.394 --> 01:23:46.271
I'm sorry.
I know it's your wife.

01:23:46.438 --> 01:23:48.190
- You had sex?
- Yeah, consensual.

01:23:48.357 --> 01:23:50.451
It was rough, but she
was screaming for it.

01:23:50.901 --> 01:23:53.245
Next morning, there's
two cops at my door.

01:23:53.570 --> 01:23:56.369
Amy has wounds that
are consistent with rape.

01:23:56.532 --> 01:23:59.581
Ligature marks on her
wrist, and my semen.

01:23:59.743 --> 01:24:03.293
It looks like I've tied Amy
to my bed, and raped her.

01:24:03.455 --> 01:24:04.798
Me!

01:24:04.957 --> 01:24:06.584
And then,
guess what they find.

01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:08.798
Headboards of my bed,
one on each side.

01:24:09.211 --> 01:24:10.428
The ties you wouldn't wear.

01:24:10.587 --> 01:24:11.930
You do know your wife.

01:24:12.589 --> 01:24:14.307
- Did you ever see her again?
- Yeah.

01:24:14.466 --> 01:24:15.888
On TV, last week,
with you.

01:24:16.468 --> 01:24:17.765
I thought, "There's Amy."

01:24:17.928 --> 01:24:21.933
"She's graduated from being
raped to being murdered."

01:24:23.475 --> 01:24:24.476
Mmm!

01:24:25.769 --> 01:24:26.850
You been watching this,
too?

01:24:26.979 --> 01:24:28.139
<i>Last night's bombshell.</i>

01:24:28.230 --> 01:24:29.231
We just found out...

01:24:29.314 --> 01:24:32.158
<i>Amy Elliott Dunne was, indeed,
pregnant when she went missing.</i>

01:24:32.651 --> 01:24:35.495
<i>Kelly Capitono,
this makes me wanna throw up.</i>

01:24:35.654 --> 01:24:37.054
<i>What is it about
a pregnant woman...</i>

01:24:37.072 --> 01:24:38.494
a <i>woman carrying
life inside her...</i>

01:24:38.657 --> 01:24:40.000
<i>that turns men into animals?</i>

01:24:40.158 --> 01:24:41.660
<i>Ellen, this is an epidemic.</i>

01:24:41.952 --> 01:24:44.153
<i>The third leading cause of
death among pregnant women...</i>

01:24:44.246 --> 01:24:46.499
<i>is homicide committed by
a boyfriend or husband.</i>

01:24:46.665 --> 01:24:49.418
<i>Let's not forget
about the wife, ever.</i>

01:24:49.585 --> 01:24:53.510
<i>Tonight, we welcome Amy's best
friend, Noelle Hawthorne.</i>

01:24:53.672 --> 01:24:55.925
<i>Thanks for being
on the show, Noelle.</i>

01:24:56.091 --> 01:24:57.263
<i>Thank you, Ellen.</i>

01:24:57.426 --> 01:24:58.803
<i>And let me just say this...</i>

01:24:58.969 --> 01:25:02.439
<i>Amy would have loved you,
and all you do for women.</i>

01:25:02.598 --> 01:25:03.598
<i>Oh, that's nice.</i>

01:25:03.682 --> 01:25:05.684
<i>Why don't you tell us about your
friend, Noelle?</i>

01:25:05.851 --> 01:25:08.274
<i>Amy was so nurturing.</i>

01:25:08.437 --> 01:25:10.690
Oh, I'd love if just once,
someone was like...

01:25:10.856 --> 01:25:12.153
"She was a real rag."

01:25:14.651 --> 01:25:17.120
<i>She was beautiful
and smart and kind.</i>

01:25:17.279 --> 01:25:19.202
Seems like a rich
bitch to me.

01:25:19.364 --> 01:25:21.867
What do you mean?
People love her.

01:25:22.034 --> 01:25:24.457
I don't know.
She seems uppity.

01:25:26.163 --> 01:25:28.541
Spoiled rich girl,
married a cheating asshole.

01:25:28.707 --> 01:25:29.799
Paid the ultimate price.

01:25:29.958 --> 01:25:32.211
<i>The only secret
was her husband.</i>

01:25:32.294 --> 01:25:33.295
<i>We never met Nick.</i>

01:25:33.462 --> 01:25:34.964
<i>He never introduced himself.</i>

01:25:35.130 --> 01:25:37.383
<i>Why was that, Noelle?
Why do you think?</i>

01:25:37.549 --> 01:25:38.550
<i>I think we know why.</i>

01:25:39.343 --> 01:25:41.471
<i>Because he had
a violent temper.</i>

01:25:41.637 --> 01:25:42.638
A little harsh.

01:25:42.721 --> 01:25:44.189
That's life, baby.

01:25:44.348 --> 01:25:45.909
<i>He knew I'd have
seen right through him.</i>

01:25:46.850 --> 01:25:48.067
Don't get me wrong.

01:25:48.226 --> 01:25:49.978
I'm not saying it's
okay he killed her.

01:25:50.145 --> 01:25:53.570
I'm just saying,
there are consequences.

01:25:55.692 --> 01:25:56.692
Fuck, yeah.

01:25:56.735 --> 01:25:59.033
<i>She was so alone.</i>

01:25:59.196 --> 01:26:00.994
<i>And she was so innocent.</i>

01:26:01.156 --> 01:26:04.501
<i>You're a good friend, Noelle. And
you're a good friend of the show.</i>

01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:05.752
Thanks for coming on.

01:26:05.911 --> 01:26:07.391
Please tell me you
landed Tanner Bolt.

01:26:07.412 --> 01:26:09.585
Tanner Bolt landed me.

01:26:09.748 --> 01:26:12.922
I'm gonna try and see Desi
Collings on my way home.

01:26:13.085 --> 01:26:14.928
And, Go...

01:26:15.087 --> 01:26:18.261
Tanner's retainer
is $100,000.

01:26:18.715 --> 01:26:20.183
That's just the retainer.

01:26:20.550 --> 01:26:24.054
Listen, I've got $47,000 in savings.
I've got $2,500 in an IRA.

01:26:24.221 --> 01:26:27.191
<i>I'm approved for a second mortgage
on the house. We will go from there.</i>

01:26:27.349 --> 01:26:29.101
Thank you.

01:26:29.267 --> 01:26:30.267
I love you.

01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:31.402
I love you, too.

01:26:31.561 --> 01:26:34.189
<i>Nick keeps his father, who has
Alzheimer's, in a facility.</i>

01:26:34.356 --> 01:26:36.450
<i>Number of times he
visited last year? One.</i>

01:26:36.525 --> 01:26:37.526
Oh, fuck!

01:26:37.609 --> 01:26:40.203
<i>His twin sister, Margo,
well, she is a peach.</i>

01:26:40.362 --> 01:26:42.706
<i>These two spend their days
in the bar Amy bought them.</i>

01:26:43.281 --> 01:26:45.283
<i>Playing what, Lauren?
Playing house?</i>

01:26:45.450 --> 01:26:46.451
What the fuck?

01:26:46.618 --> 01:26:49.292
<i>Twin siblings
often enable and abet.</i>

01:26:49.788 --> 01:26:51.631
<i>While I never examined Nick,
or his sister...</i>

01:26:52.416 --> 01:26:54.544
<i>they both seem very,
very close.</i>

01:26:54.876 --> 01:26:56.128
It's twin-cest.

01:26:56.461 --> 01:26:59.055
<i>Disturbingly close, Lauren.</i>

01:26:59.214 --> 01:27:01.091
<i>And so,
we close with a question.</i>

01:27:01.258 --> 01:27:02.635
<i>What kind of moral rot...</i>

01:27:02.801 --> 01:27:07.398
<i>allows a beautiful, talented,
kind, smart, loving mother...</i>

01:27:07.556 --> 01:27:11.151
<i>to vanish without the heavens
hearing our outraged cries?</i>

01:27:11.309 --> 01:27:12.390
- Can I bum a cigarette?
- Yeah.

01:27:12.394 --> 01:27:16.149
<i>Amy Elliott Dunne, we care about
you, and we will not forget.</i>

01:27:16.648 --> 01:27:18.742
<i>And you know what else
we won't forget?</i>

01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:21.153
<i>Missouri has
the death penalty.</i>

01:27:21.319 --> 01:27:22.491
Amen.

01:27:48.346 --> 01:27:50.519
I'd like to report
some strange activity...

01:27:50.682 --> 01:27:54.186
near the woodshed on the
property of one Margo Dunne.

01:28:35.393 --> 01:28:36.861
Hey-

01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:43.447
Mr. Dunne.

01:28:43.527 --> 01:28:44.528
Mr. Collings.

01:28:45.529 --> 01:28:48.499
I know you. I saw you at
the volunteer center.

01:28:48.657 --> 01:28:50.375
I wanted to help.

01:28:51.159 --> 01:28:52.760
Well, I hope you don't
mind me coming by.

01:28:52.911 --> 01:28:56.006
I got your address from this
letter that you wrote my wife.

01:28:56.873 --> 01:29:00.252
Amy and I believe in the
lost art of letter-writing.

01:29:00.418 --> 01:29:04.264
I always wondered why you
kept in touch after...

01:29:04.923 --> 01:29:06.095
everything.

01:29:06.258 --> 01:29:08.556
You were together for two years
in boarding school, right?

01:29:08.718 --> 01:29:10.766
She was my first
serious girlfriend.

01:29:10.929 --> 01:29:12.272
Why did you break up?

01:29:12.347 --> 01:29:13.599
That's a strange question.

01:29:13.765 --> 01:29:15.608
Did you treat her bad?
Did you cheat on her?

01:29:15.767 --> 01:29:16.859
That's a rude question.

01:29:17.018 --> 01:29:18.611
Let me tell you
what Amy told me.

01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:21.614
She dumped you,
you completely unraveled.

01:29:21.773 --> 01:29:23.741
You stalked her,
you threatened her...

01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:27.279
and you attempted suicide in her
bed and were institutionalized.

01:29:27.445 --> 01:29:31.245
Your wife is missing, and you came
all this way to tell me this?

01:29:31.408 --> 01:29:33.627
I thought there might be
another side to this story.

01:29:37.289 --> 01:29:39.132
Mr. Collings.

01:29:41.209 --> 01:29:43.132
Fuck.

01:29:48.758 --> 01:29:51.637
<i>...the missing
persons case of Amy Elliott Dunne.</i>

01:29:51.803 --> 01:29:53.897
<i>She is the beautiful
blonde inspiration...</i>

01:29:53.972 --> 01:29:55.474
<i>for the Amazing Amy
kids' book series.</i>

01:30:12.657 --> 01:30:14.751
You're reading
that diary again?

01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:15.911
You know how it ends.

01:30:15.994 --> 01:30:18.338
It interests me.

01:30:18.496 --> 01:30:19.964
Hey, Rhonda.

01:30:20.123 --> 01:30:21.921
"He's gonna kill me."
The end.

01:30:22.083 --> 01:30:24.085
Why did he go to his
dad's house to burn it?

01:30:24.252 --> 01:30:25.253
It's private.
There's no one there.

01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:28.094
Why didn't he make sure
it actually burned?

01:30:28.256 --> 01:30:31.100
Because he tripped the alarm. You
were up his ass with a flashlight.

01:30:31.259 --> 01:30:33.478
The whole thing
just feels hinky.

01:30:33.637 --> 01:30:35.605
Like finding
an envelope marked "Clue."

01:30:35.764 --> 01:30:36.765
You ever hear
the expression...

01:30:36.932 --> 01:30:38.773
"The simplest answer
is often the correct one"?

01:30:39.476 --> 01:30:41.353
Actually, I've never
found that to be true.

01:30:41.519 --> 01:30:43.317
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:30:45.982 --> 01:30:46.983
Hey-

01:30:56.451 --> 01:30:58.203
Elvis is in Missouri.

01:30:58.370 --> 01:31:00.372
- Thank God.
- Come on in.

01:31:00.538 --> 01:31:02.256
<i>First thing you have
to understand about Amy...</i>

01:31:02.332 --> 01:31:03.458
she loves
to teach lessons.

01:31:03.541 --> 01:31:04.633
Play God.

01:31:04.709 --> 01:31:05.881
Yeah, Old Testament God.

01:31:06.044 --> 01:31:07.045
Okay. Keep talking.

01:31:07.128 --> 01:31:08.721
She finds out I've been
cheating on her with Andie...

01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:10.348
decides to
teach me a lesson.

01:31:10.507 --> 01:31:12.305
Fakes her own death,
frames me for it.

01:31:12.467 --> 01:31:14.561
Blood in the house, credit
cards, life insurance.

01:31:14.719 --> 01:31:15.811
She does the treasure hunt.

01:31:15.971 --> 01:31:17.332
Now, the treasure
hunt is critical.

01:31:17.347 --> 01:31:19.645
She's taking us on
a tour of my infidelities.

01:31:19.724 --> 01:31:20.896
Rubbing my nose in it.

01:31:21.059 --> 01:31:22.982
And she leaves clue number
one for the police...

01:31:23.144 --> 01:31:24.745
which will lead them
back to my office...

01:31:24.896 --> 01:31:27.319
which is a place where
Andie and I would often...

01:31:27.482 --> 01:31:28.699
And she leaves
a pair of red panties.

01:31:28.858 --> 01:31:29.905
Right. Racy, looks bad.

01:31:30.068 --> 01:31:31.661
Clue two.
My father's house.

01:31:31.820 --> 01:31:32.946
Another place
where Andie and I...

01:31:33.029 --> 01:31:34.076
would occasionally
have relations.

01:31:34.239 --> 01:31:35.491
- Clue three?
- Woodshed.

01:31:35.657 --> 01:31:37.034
- Also a location...
- Oh, my God.

01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:38.827
- We had limited options.
- A hotel.

01:31:38.994 --> 01:31:40.166
Amy would have seen
the credit card bill.

01:31:40.245 --> 01:31:41.405
Put it on
Andie's credit card.

01:31:41.538 --> 01:31:42.755
Andie's statement
went right to her parents.

01:31:42.914 --> 01:31:45.337
Ew. Nick, Margo, can we head
over to the little brown house?

01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:47.173
- This leads us to what?
- My dad's house.

01:31:47.335 --> 01:31:49.087
Dad's house is blue.

01:31:50.380 --> 01:31:53.429
After the divorce, when Dad
wasn't coming around...

01:31:53.758 --> 01:31:57.888
I used to pretend that he was
a spy named Mr. Brown, who...

01:31:58.054 --> 01:32:01.604
for the sake of his children's
safety, had to deny their existence.

01:32:01.766 --> 01:32:03.188
You never told me that.

01:32:03.435 --> 01:32:05.108
You told her that?

01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:07.568
We've got incriminating red
panties in your office.

01:32:07.897 --> 01:32:10.297
We've got a Showcase Showdown
worth of crap in your woodshed.

01:32:11.401 --> 01:32:14.621
So, what in God's name is at
your father's house, Nick?

01:32:14.779 --> 01:32:15.826
And be honest.

01:32:15.905 --> 01:32:17.748
I honestly have no idea.

01:32:23.663 --> 01:32:24.835
Well...

01:32:24.914 --> 01:32:28.635
Whatever they found, I think it's
safe to assume that it's very bad.

01:32:30.462 --> 01:32:32.715
<i>We got a lot of
uncontained issues here.</i>

01:32:32.964 --> 01:32:36.059
Nick, do you have any idea
as to what Andie's mindset is?

01:32:36.259 --> 01:32:38.933
Well, we haven't
communicated since the vigil.

01:32:39.095 --> 01:32:40.312
Okay. Amy's parents?

01:32:40.472 --> 01:32:41.940
- No, it's...
- More pressure.

01:32:42.098 --> 01:32:43.441
We got a hurt,
young girlfriend...

01:32:43.516 --> 01:32:45.314
who will no doubt go public
at any moment.

01:32:45.393 --> 01:32:46.873
- No, Andie won't do that.
- She will.

01:32:46.936 --> 01:32:48.654
They always do.
Don't take it personally.

01:32:49.147 --> 01:32:51.320
Amy's got us in
an interesting bind.

01:32:51.649 --> 01:32:52.741
We need to tell
the cops about Andie.

01:32:52.817 --> 01:32:53.818
Really?

01:32:53.985 --> 01:32:56.158
Right now, Andie just
gives you another motive.

01:32:56.988 --> 01:32:58.160
We need to tell the cops
about the woodshed.

01:32:58.448 --> 01:32:59.745
We need to be on
the front end of that.

01:32:59.908 --> 01:33:02.252
But I'm gonna warn you
as to what will happen.

01:33:02.827 --> 01:33:03.919
They'll go after Margo.

01:33:04.037 --> 01:33:05.038
They can't do that,
can they?

01:33:05.121 --> 01:33:06.919
She's your accomplice. She
helped you hide the evidence.

01:33:07.082 --> 01:33:09.176
In all likelihood,
she knows that you killed Amy.

01:33:10.085 --> 01:33:11.507
Oh, God.

01:33:11.836 --> 01:33:13.804
Well, what are we
going to do?

01:33:13.963 --> 01:33:15.180
We find Amy.

01:33:15.256 --> 01:33:17.475
No. Any other strategy
is missing the point.

01:33:17.634 --> 01:33:19.875
I've got two ex-Secret Service
guys that are really good.

01:33:20.011 --> 01:33:21.513
I'll put them on it.

01:33:21.679 --> 01:33:23.101
But where do they start,
Nick?

01:33:23.473 --> 01:33:24.599
Where would Amy go?

01:33:26.768 --> 01:33:28.395
I have no idea.

01:33:30.855 --> 01:33:31.856
Oh!

01:33:32.857 --> 01:33:35.485
Are we keeping score?

01:33:36.152 --> 01:33:37.529
Hey!

01:33:39.155 --> 01:33:42.204
I thought we were steering
clear of men for a while.

01:33:42.325 --> 01:33:43.325
He's nice.

01:33:43.368 --> 01:33:45.871
Because he wants
to fuck you.

01:33:47.497 --> 01:33:49.044
She's still
moping about her ex?

01:33:50.834 --> 01:33:53.508
He got cheated on, too.

01:33:56.881 --> 01:33:59.634
We three are the saddest
sacks in all the Ozarks.

01:33:59.801 --> 01:34:01.348
I'm not sad.

01:34:01.803 --> 01:34:02.804
I'm angry-

01:34:02.887 --> 01:34:04.560
There you go.

01:34:04.722 --> 01:34:07.225
I almost drank myself to
death when my wife left me.

01:34:07.392 --> 01:34:09.520
I was gonna kill myself.
Can you believe that?

01:34:09.686 --> 01:34:10.807
Don't give him the pleasure.

01:34:10.854 --> 01:34:13.858
I was going to drown myself
in the Gulf of Mexico...

01:34:14.023 --> 01:34:16.401
let myself be dinner
for the great whites.

01:34:16.568 --> 01:34:18.241
Gulf is bull sharks,
Miss Nawlins.

01:34:18.403 --> 01:34:22.203
Why should I die?
I'm not the asshole.

01:34:22.365 --> 01:34:24.834
Please put that on a T-shirt.

01:34:26.369 --> 01:34:27.370
Oh!

01:34:33.376 --> 01:34:35.754
Miss Moneybags. I thought
you said you were broke.

01:34:37.255 --> 01:34:38.552
That's a fat wad.

01:34:40.341 --> 01:34:42.014
It's mostly singles.

01:34:42.177 --> 01:34:44.054
Singles?
What are you, a stripper?

01:34:44.846 --> 01:34:47.440
Swamp Girls,
or Treasure Chest?

01:34:48.558 --> 01:34:49.605
We're just teasing.

01:34:50.393 --> 01:34:52.191
Don't they tease
people down in NOLA?

01:34:54.606 --> 01:34:57.450
<i>We can expect
Nick Dunne's arrest any day now.</i>

01:34:57.609 --> 01:35:01.204
<i>We've got blood in the house,
huge debt, an unwanted pregnancy.</i>

01:35:01.362 --> 01:35:05.208
<i>And we have Amy Elliott Dunne,
missing for five days...</i>

01:35:05.366 --> 01:35:07.494
<i>crying out for justice.</i>

01:35:08.286 --> 01:35:10.004
<i>We'll be right back.</i>

01:36:02.257 --> 01:36:04.601
Tanner has a very bad idea
he's going to pitch you.

01:36:04.676 --> 01:36:05.676
Yeah?

01:36:05.718 --> 01:36:07.186
You're doing Sharon Schieber
tomorrow in St. Louis.

01:36:07.345 --> 01:36:08.345
It could go so wrong.

01:36:08.388 --> 01:36:10.028
And you are going
to tell her about Andie.

01:36:10.181 --> 01:36:11.353
- Nope.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:36:11.516 --> 01:36:13.393
That sounds like
a very bad idea.

01:36:13.559 --> 01:36:15.527
You haven't heard from her
in three days.

01:36:15.687 --> 01:36:19.282
This is a ticking time bomb.
You've gotta throw yourself on it.

01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:20.441
People are gonna hate me.

01:36:20.525 --> 01:36:21.868
And then,
they will forgive you.

01:36:22.026 --> 01:36:24.370
A guy admitting that he's a
gigantic asshole on television?

01:36:24.529 --> 01:36:26.202
People empathize with that.

01:36:27.615 --> 01:36:29.413
- Why don't we just put out a statement?
- They need to see you.

01:36:29.575 --> 01:36:32.545
Sharon's specials,
they get 10 million viewers.

01:36:32.704 --> 01:36:35.082
She is a crusader. If she
takes you on as a cause...

01:36:35.248 --> 01:36:37.046
She's going to
ask real questions.

01:36:37.208 --> 01:36:38.926
I will drill you as if you
were doing a deposition.

01:36:39.085 --> 01:36:40.428
What to say,
what not to say.

01:36:40.586 --> 01:36:41.587
A trained monkey?

01:36:41.754 --> 01:36:43.914
A trained monkey who doesn't
get the lethal injection.

01:36:45.133 --> 01:36:48.478
Nick, this case is about
what people think of you.

01:36:48.636 --> 01:36:50.263
They need to like you.

01:36:50.430 --> 01:36:54.276
Now, you do this and you will
reach millions of those people.

01:36:55.435 --> 01:36:57.938
Maybe I only
need to reach one.

01:37:07.155 --> 01:37:08.156
Hello?

01:37:08.239 --> 01:37:09.456
Hey, baby.

01:37:10.908 --> 01:37:12.501
One minute.

01:37:21.252 --> 01:37:22.595
- Hey.
- Hey-

01:37:22.670 --> 01:37:23.671
You clearing out?

01:37:23.755 --> 01:37:25.473
No, I'm just cleaning up.

01:37:25.631 --> 01:37:27.099
Let us come in
and say goodbye.

01:37:27.258 --> 01:37:28.259
I'll come by before...

01:37:28.343 --> 01:37:30.095
Let us give you a hand.

01:37:36.267 --> 01:37:38.736
Yeah, you gotta
clear everything out, here.

01:37:40.396 --> 01:37:43.115
Dorothy is a real stickler.

01:37:44.442 --> 01:37:47.742
Not even a spare hanger
can you leave behind.

01:37:50.323 --> 01:37:51.884
Gotta make sure
nothing's tucked inside.

01:37:54.410 --> 01:37:55.411
A sock...

01:37:56.329 --> 01:37:59.128
or undies
or what have you.

01:38:03.961 --> 01:38:05.304
You did a real good job.

01:38:07.298 --> 01:38:09.426
Where is the money,
sweetheart?

01:38:13.096 --> 01:38:14.097
Look under her dress.

01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:16.766
He talked you into this?

01:38:16.933 --> 01:38:18.150
I talked him into it.

01:38:18.309 --> 01:38:20.311
The second you leave,
I'm calling the cops.

01:38:20.812 --> 01:38:24.362
Your glasses are fake.
Your hair's dyed all hamster.

01:38:24.524 --> 01:38:27.494
You say your name's Nancy, but you
don't even answer to it half the time.

01:38:27.652 --> 01:38:29.996
You're hiding. I don't know
why, and I don't really care.

01:38:30.154 --> 01:38:32.202
But you ain't
gonna call the cops.

01:38:32.532 --> 01:38:34.612
And I don't think you've
ever really been hit before.

01:38:34.617 --> 01:38:35.743
Ow!

01:38:40.832 --> 01:38:42.834
Holy shit.

01:38:45.878 --> 01:38:48.552
Sorry,
but we really need the money.

01:38:48.714 --> 01:38:50.315
Next place,
be more careful, okay?

01:38:50.383 --> 01:38:52.783
There are a lot of people out
there a lot worse than we are.

01:39:27.336 --> 01:39:28.963
Excuse me.
You can't sleep here.

01:39:56.574 --> 01:39:59.669
I did not kill my wife.

01:40:00.661 --> 01:40:03.835
Why don't you try it again?
A little less wooden.

01:40:03.998 --> 01:40:05.090
I didn't kill my Wife.

01:40:06.918 --> 01:40:08.511
- What are you doing?
- Every time you look smug...

01:40:08.669 --> 01:40:11.218
or annoyed or tense, I'm gonna
hit you with a gummy bear.

01:40:11.380 --> 01:40:13.223
- That's supposed to make me less tense?
- Let's try it again.

01:40:13.382 --> 01:40:14.929
Mr. Dunne,
from what I understand...

01:40:15.009 --> 01:40:16.682
you and your wife
had some bumps.

01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:21.566
Yeah, we had some tough years.
Um, I lost my job.

01:40:21.724 --> 01:40:22.725
You both did.

01:40:25.436 --> 01:40:27.188
We both lost our jobs.

01:40:27.355 --> 01:40:29.795
I had to move back home so we
could take care of my mother...

01:40:29.941 --> 01:40:32.364
who was dying of cancer
and my dad, who had...

01:40:32.527 --> 01:40:34.154
Your dad's scorched earth.

01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:35.867
Let's talk about your mom,
how close you were.

01:40:36.030 --> 01:40:37.077
Go on.

01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:39.618
For a while,
things had been building up.

01:40:39.784 --> 01:40:43.163
"Built up" implies that an
explosion is coming. No.

01:40:43.329 --> 01:40:45.752
At a certain point,
we got on the wrong track.

01:40:46.582 --> 01:40:48.084
I had a moment of weakness.

01:40:48.251 --> 01:40:50.674
Your "moment"
was over 15 months.

01:40:54.465 --> 01:40:56.559
I disrespected my wife.

01:40:57.218 --> 01:40:59.641
And I disrespected
my marriage.

01:41:00.096 --> 01:41:01.473
And I'll always regret it.

01:41:01.973 --> 01:41:03.020
That works.

01:41:03.099 --> 01:41:05.397
Don't be afraid to play up the
dufus husband thing, Nick.

01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:07.107
"I was an idiot.
I'm a fuck-up."

01:41:07.186 --> 01:41:08.267
"Everything I do is wrong."

01:41:08.271 --> 01:41:10.239
I know. What men are
supposed to do in general.

01:41:12.191 --> 01:41:13.391
- Thank you.
- How do you feel?

01:41:13.442 --> 01:41:16.662
I feel good. Go, can you
pass me that box, please?

01:41:17.071 --> 01:41:19.574
It's Amy's 33rd
birthday present to me.

01:41:19.699 --> 01:41:20.700
You hate that watch.

01:41:20.783 --> 01:41:22.751
No, Go.
I love that watch.

01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:24.787
Just like I love this tie.

01:41:24.954 --> 01:41:28.083
Just like I love my wife.

01:41:58.446 --> 01:41:59.698
It's you!

01:41:59.864 --> 01:42:01.866
It's you.

01:42:02.700 --> 01:42:04.702
I'm sorry.

01:42:05.369 --> 01:42:06.712
I'm sorry.

01:42:07.622 --> 01:42:09.499
Good God.

01:42:09.665 --> 01:42:11.042
Last week...

01:42:11.542 --> 01:42:15.297
I threatened to leave,
and he said he'd find me...

01:42:15.379 --> 01:42:16.722
and he'd kill me.

01:42:17.048 --> 01:42:19.221
So, I disappeared.

01:42:20.384 --> 01:42:22.227
I lost the baby.

01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:24.393
I couldn't even
tell my parents.

01:42:24.555 --> 01:42:28.480
I'm so ashamed
and I'm so afraid.

01:42:29.226 --> 01:42:30.398
Well, he is looking for you.

01:42:31.062 --> 01:42:32.905
He showed up on my doorstep
three days ago.

01:42:33.064 --> 01:42:35.567
He tracked me from
my letters to you.

01:42:36.692 --> 01:42:37.909
You saved them.

01:42:38.486 --> 01:42:39.487
Knowing you were out there...

01:42:39.570 --> 01:42:42.073
was the only thing that's kept
me going these past few years.

01:42:42.239 --> 01:42:43.582
Let's go to the police.
You can explain everything.

01:42:43.658 --> 01:42:44.830
No, I can't turn up now.

01:42:44.992 --> 01:42:48.087
I'd be a pariah.
Everyone would hate me.

01:42:49.914 --> 01:42:52.087
Is it wrong to want
Nick to go prison?

01:42:52.249 --> 01:42:54.047
He should go to prison
for what he's done.

01:42:56.921 --> 01:42:59.265
I'm setting you up
at my lake house.

01:42:59.423 --> 01:43:00.424
It's utterly secluded.

01:43:01.842 --> 01:43:03.560
Why are you so good to me?

01:43:03.719 --> 01:43:04.936
You know why.

01:43:05.096 --> 01:43:06.097
Excuse me.

01:43:06.263 --> 01:43:07.264
I know you, don't I?

01:43:07.348 --> 01:43:08.349
No.

01:43:08.432 --> 01:43:10.105
You're one of
the Nolan girls, right?

01:43:10.267 --> 01:43:12.941
No, we're from Winnipeg.
Excuse us. Oh.

01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:14.021
We should leave.

01:43:14.105 --> 01:43:15.545
Just a second.

01:43:15.773 --> 01:43:18.902
That was Boney.
I'll call her later.

01:43:19.068 --> 01:43:20.945
Tannen
Nice to see you.

01:43:21.237 --> 01:43:22.238
Sharon! Hi.

01:43:22.405 --> 01:43:23.952
Hope this is
worth my while.

01:43:24.115 --> 01:43:25.241
You're gonna be very happy.

01:43:25.449 --> 01:43:26.450
Sharon.

01:43:26.534 --> 01:43:28.628
Ms. Schieber. Thank you
so much for doing this.

01:43:28.786 --> 01:43:30.788
Can I get you anything to drink
or eat before we get started?

01:43:30.955 --> 01:43:32.957
No,
I had some gummy bears.

01:43:34.041 --> 01:43:35.634
What the fuck?

01:43:36.794 --> 01:43:37.920
I'm sorry?

01:43:38.337 --> 01:43:40.385
<i>We have a
major shocking development...</i>

01:43:40.464 --> 01:43:42.091
<i>in the Amazing Amy
disappearance.</i>

01:43:42.258 --> 01:43:43.510
<i>We go live to that story now.</i>

01:43:43.676 --> 01:43:44.973
Oh, my God.

01:43:47.138 --> 01:43:48.811
You little slut.

01:43:48.973 --> 01:43:51.977
<i>My name is Andie Fitzgerald.</i>

01:43:52.977 --> 01:43:54.524
<i>I met Nicholas Dunne...</i>

01:43:54.687 --> 01:43:58.191
<i>when he was my creative writing
teacher at Mill Valley.</i>

01:43:58.357 --> 01:44:00.325
Why is she dressed
like a babysitter?

01:44:00.484 --> 01:44:01.827
<i>I am deeply ashamed...</i>

01:44:01.986 --> 01:44:04.990
<i>of having been romantically
involved with a married man.</i>

01:44:05.156 --> 01:44:06.954
The girl with
the giant cum-on-me tits.

01:44:07.116 --> 01:44:08.993
<i>I truly believed
we were in love.</i>

01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:11.003
Now, she looks like
a fucking Mennonite.

01:44:12.496 --> 01:44:13.839
<i>I know that is no excuse.</i>

01:44:13.998 --> 01:44:15.170
No, it is not.

01:44:15.332 --> 01:44:19.553
<i>I do not, in my heart, believe Nick
Dunne would have killed for me.</i>

01:44:19.712 --> 01:44:22.010
<i>My prayers go out to
everyone who loves Amy.</i>

01:44:22.173 --> 01:44:25.177
<i>I apologize for the pain
this has caused them.</i>

01:44:30.389 --> 01:44:32.357
<i>We have loved
Nick Dunne like a son.</i>

01:44:33.184 --> 01:44:34.561
<i>That love ended today.</i>

01:44:34.852 --> 01:44:36.354
Come on,
you're staring at ghosts.

01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:39.194
<i>He met our trust
with lie after lie.</i>

01:44:39.523 --> 01:44:41.321
<i>We now absolutely believe...</i>

01:44:41.484 --> 01:44:43.737
<i>Nick is involved in the
disappearance of our daughter.</i>

01:44:43.903 --> 01:44:46.156
<i>Our Amazing Amy.</i>

01:44:47.031 --> 01:44:49.159
Well, this just got
very exciting.

01:44:49.867 --> 01:44:51.585
We need a moment.

01:44:53.579 --> 01:44:55.206
We're gonna have
to bow out of this.

01:44:55.372 --> 01:44:57.092
- Nothing has changed.
- Everything has changed.

01:44:57.208 --> 01:44:59.506
An hour ago,
we were ahead of this. Now?

01:44:59.668 --> 01:45:01.229
- I can handle this.
- We're on the defense.

01:45:01.337 --> 01:45:03.260
This is a completely
different dynamic.

01:45:03.422 --> 01:45:04.514
I can handle it.

01:45:04.590 --> 01:45:06.183
She's going to
eat you alive.

01:45:06.717 --> 01:45:08.390
Just trust me.

01:45:12.765 --> 01:45:14.017
Okay-

01:45:14.183 --> 01:45:15.275
Great.

01:45:16.101 --> 01:45:17.569
Mic him.

01:45:37.289 --> 01:45:39.087
One, two, three,
four, five.

01:45:45.089 --> 01:45:46.090
Thank you.

01:45:47.591 --> 01:45:48.763
He shouldn't smile
at the makeup artist.

01:45:48.884 --> 01:45:49.931
Yeah, no kidding.

01:45:54.598 --> 01:45:57.602
Roll tape. Five... four...

01:45:57.768 --> 01:45:59.395
three... two...

01:46:01.605 --> 01:46:04.404
Seriously, I can't believe
how fucking good you were.

01:46:04.567 --> 01:46:06.007
- Amy brings out the best in me.
- Don't.

01:46:06.068 --> 01:46:07.536
Keep it together, you two.

01:46:07.611 --> 01:46:09.113
At least for
the next 24 hours.

01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:10.372
People still hate you.

01:46:10.447 --> 01:46:11.573
Women want to
scratch your eyes out.

01:46:11.740 --> 01:46:13.492
Andie was really good TV.

01:46:13.576 --> 01:46:14.576
She's a good person.

01:46:14.618 --> 01:46:15.665
Therein lies
the problem.

01:46:15.744 --> 01:46:16.744
Ride this out...

01:46:16.787 --> 01:46:18.209
and when Sharon airs tomorrow,

01:46:18.289 --> 01:46:19.689
we'll be looking
at a whole new you.

01:46:19.832 --> 01:46:21.300
But, until then...

01:46:21.458 --> 01:46:23.301
don't show your face.

01:46:23.460 --> 01:46:25.303
No problem.

01:46:41.604 --> 01:46:42.981
Welcome.

01:46:44.982 --> 01:46:46.700
Make yourself at home.

01:46:46.859 --> 01:46:50.705
I've got music,
satellite...

01:46:50.779 --> 01:46:51.779
Netflix.

01:46:51.822 --> 01:46:52.823
<i>He was her teacher!</i>

01:46:52.907 --> 01:46:53.908
Roku.

01:46:54.533 --> 01:46:57.036
Internet, obviously.

01:46:57.620 --> 01:47:00.214
<i>Here is
a supposedly grown man...</i>

01:47:00.372 --> 01:47:02.795
If there is ever anything
you have a taste for...

01:47:02.875 --> 01:47:04.127
and you can't find it...

01:47:04.209 --> 01:47:06.337
just let me know
and I will get it for you.

01:47:06.503 --> 01:47:09.507
<i>Instead of the A-B-C's, he
taught her the birds and the bees.</i>

01:47:09.673 --> 01:47:12.472
<i>And just think how her mother
must feel at a time like this.</i>

01:47:12.635 --> 01:47:14.637
Wine cellar's downstairs.

01:47:18.098 --> 01:47:19.350
I'll get you
some clothes, too.

01:47:19.516 --> 01:47:22.941
Not that I don't appreciate
Bait Shop Chic.

01:47:24.104 --> 01:47:26.482
The floors are heated,
just dial to your liking.

01:47:26.649 --> 01:47:29.698
There's robes and towels.
The shower has steam.

01:47:29.860 --> 01:47:32.204
The bathtub has
a massage cycle.

01:47:34.031 --> 01:47:35.954
There's a great view,
if you're in the mood.

01:47:36.116 --> 01:47:37.538
Blackout curtains
if you're not.

01:47:37.701 --> 01:47:40.045
The bed is Savoir.

01:47:40.204 --> 01:47:42.457
You'll never get
a better sleep.

01:47:43.666 --> 01:47:44.667
Oh.

01:47:46.335 --> 01:47:48.679
Oh, this is just
what I need.

01:47:50.130 --> 01:47:52.053
I'm so exhausted.

01:47:53.550 --> 01:47:55.723
I'll leave you to it, then.

01:47:57.471 --> 01:48:00.224
Amy, I am so happy
that you are here.

01:48:01.392 --> 01:48:04.236
And I don't want you to
worry for one moment.

01:48:04.395 --> 01:48:06.238
There are cameras everywhere.

01:48:06.397 --> 01:48:09.150
The exterior, all along the
grounds, the entryway.

01:48:09.316 --> 01:48:10.363
Anyone...

01:48:10.484 --> 01:48:12.737
who is caught
coming or going...

01:48:15.990 --> 01:48:17.583
will be recorded.

01:48:18.075 --> 01:48:19.076
Ah.

01:48:19.159 --> 01:48:21.878
You are more than safe.

01:48:23.831 --> 01:48:27.335
And I am not letting
you get away again.

01:49:12.629 --> 01:49:13.676
Good morning!

01:49:13.756 --> 01:49:14.757
Don't do that!

01:49:16.425 --> 01:49:17.551
I'm sorry.

01:49:19.553 --> 01:49:21.055
I need to feel safe.

01:49:21.388 --> 01:49:24.392
You are very safe.

01:49:26.602 --> 01:49:28.104
- What have you been up to?
- Nothing.

01:49:28.270 --> 01:49:30.864
Amy, I'm not Nick.

01:49:31.023 --> 01:49:33.025
It's hard for me.

01:49:35.944 --> 01:49:39.574
After so many years
under someone's thumb...

01:49:41.825 --> 01:49:43.122
I know just what
that feels like.

01:49:44.036 --> 01:49:46.038
You were never
under my thumb.

01:49:46.622 --> 01:49:48.545
- On your leash.
- Never.

01:49:48.707 --> 01:49:50.209
A new start.

01:49:51.502 --> 01:49:53.129
Decent clothes.

01:49:54.046 --> 01:49:56.299
Hair dye. Makeup.
Tweezers.

01:49:56.590 --> 01:49:58.092
There's a gym
overlooking the lake.

01:49:58.467 --> 01:50:00.185
The sooner you
look like yourself...

01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:01.887
the sooner you'll
feel like yourself.

01:50:02.054 --> 01:50:03.351
I'll get groceries
for tonight...

01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:05.057
we'll watch Sharon Schieber,
and finally move on.

01:50:05.224 --> 01:50:07.773
I think that's something
I should watch on my own.

01:50:08.185 --> 01:50:09.903
Nonsense.

01:50:13.524 --> 01:50:14.946
I'll be back.

01:50:16.568 --> 01:50:18.616
And I am looking forward...

01:50:18.779 --> 01:50:21.703
to my reunion
with Amy Elliott.

01:50:44.888 --> 01:50:46.060
Great.

01:50:47.099 --> 01:50:49.067
<i>Good evening,
I'm Sharon Schieber.</i>

01:50:49.226 --> 01:50:50.853
<i>- Tonight, exclusively...
- Hurry up.</i>

01:50:51.770 --> 01:50:53.568
<i>A husband breaks
his silence...</i>

01:50:53.647 --> 01:50:56.025
<i>not just on his
wife's disappearance...</i>

01:50:56.191 --> 01:50:59.991
<i>but on his infidelity,
and all those shocking rumors.</i>

01:51:02.447 --> 01:51:03.869
<i>Nick Dunne...</i>

01:51:04.032 --> 01:51:07.411
<i>you're probably the most hated
man in America right now.</i>

01:51:07.578 --> 01:51:10.047
<i>I probably am.
And I probably deserve it.</i>

01:51:10.205 --> 01:51:11.673
I bought that tie.

01:51:11.832 --> 01:51:13.755
<i>Did you kill your Wife, Nick?</i>

01:51:13.917 --> 01:51:17.012
<i>I did not kill my wife.</i>

01:51:17.671 --> 01:51:19.093
<i>I am not a murderer.</i>

01:51:19.256 --> 01:51:21.054
<i>But you were unfaithful.</i>

01:51:21.216 --> 01:51:23.310
<i>I was unfaithful.</i>

01:51:23.468 --> 01:51:25.015
<i>And I am deeply ashamed.</i>

01:51:25.179 --> 01:51:27.523
<i>And, on top of that,
you allowed Amy's parents...</i>

01:51:27.806 --> 01:51:30.434
<i>her friends, all the
people in your hometown...</i>

01:51:30.601 --> 01:51:33.150
<i>believe you were
a loving husband,</i>

01:51:33.228 --> 01:51:35.401
<i>desperate to find
his missing wife.</i>

01:51:35.564 --> 01:51:37.324
<i>Well, I am desperate
to find my missing wife.</i>

01:51:37.482 --> 01:51:38.859
<i>You say that,
but I'm wondering...</i>

01:51:38.942 --> 01:51:40.364
<i>how you expect us
to believe you...</i>

01:51:40.527 --> 01:51:42.245
<i>now that we know
you're a liar.</i>

01:51:42.529 --> 01:51:45.533
<i>I didn't come
forward with my affair...</i>

01:51:45.699 --> 01:51:48.873
<i>because I knew it would make
me look really, really bad.</i>

01:51:49.703 --> 01:51:51.376
<i>But I don't care
about that anymore.</i>

01:51:51.538 --> 01:51:53.040
<i>I just want to find my wife.</i>

01:51:53.207 --> 01:51:54.550
<i>I'm just trying
to get clear...</i>

01:51:54.625 --> 01:51:55.626
<i>Let me be clear.</i>

01:51:55.792 --> 01:52:00.093
<i>Just because I am not a murderer
doesn't make me a good guy.</i>

01:52:00.255 --> 01:52:01.427
<i>I'm not a good guy.</i>

01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:04.309
<i>I was a bad husband
to a great wife.</i>

01:52:04.676 --> 01:52:06.428
<i>I broke the vow
that I made to her.</i>

01:52:06.678 --> 01:52:09.227
<i>Those are pretty words,
Nick.</i>

01:52:09.556 --> 01:52:11.183
<i>But what does that
really mean to you?</i>

01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:13.398
<i>It basically means
that I was a con artist.</i>

01:52:14.353 --> 01:52:17.448
<i>I met Amy Elliott
seven years</i> ago.

01:52:17.606 --> 01:52:19.199
<i>I was completely transfixed.</i>

01:52:19.650 --> 01:52:21.448
<i>Amy can do that to you.</i>

01:52:21.610 --> 01:52:24.033
<i>I was this average guy
from an average place...</i>

01:52:24.196 --> 01:52:26.073
<i>with mediocre aspirations.</i>

01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:28.618
<i>And I met a woman
who dazzled me.</i>

01:52:28.784 --> 01:52:30.627
<i>And I wanted her
to love me...</i>

01:52:30.786 --> 01:52:33.130
<i>so I pretended to
be better than I was.</i>

01:52:33.997 --> 01:52:37.547
<i>When we got married,
I promised to be that guy.</i>

01:52:37.709 --> 01:52:39.427
<i>That guy who works harder.</i>

01:52:39.586 --> 01:52:41.680
<i>That guy who,
who lives and acts...</i>

01:52:41.838 --> 01:52:44.762
<i>and loves with as much passion
as she does.</i>

01:52:45.008 --> 01:52:46.329
<i>But I failed her.</i>

01:52:47.135 --> 01:52:48.456
<i>Instead of doing
what was right...</i>

01:52:49.763 --> 01:52:50.935
<i>I did what was easy.</i>

01:52:51.682 --> 01:52:55.186
<i>You talk like a man who believes
he can make amends to his wife.</i>

01:52:55.352 --> 01:52:56.854
<i>Who believes his
wife is still alive.</i>

01:52:57.020 --> 01:52:58.317
<i>She is still alive.</i>

01:53:00.190 --> 01:53:03.034
<i>Will you look at
that camera for me?</i>

01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:06.204
<i>Will you look in the lens...</i>

01:53:06.363 --> 01:53:08.206
<i>and talk to your wife?</i>

01:53:08.365 --> 01:53:11.335
<i>If she is out there, able to
hear and see you tonight...</i>

01:53:11.493 --> 01:53:14.167
<i>what would you like
to say to her, Nick?</i>

01:53:17.708 --> 01:53:20.006
<i>Amy, I love you.</i>

01:53:20.711 --> 01:53:23.385
<i>You're the best person
I've ever known.</i>

01:53:23.547 --> 01:53:25.720
<i>And I've taken
myself to the woodshed...</i>

01:53:25.799 --> 01:53:27.893
<i>for the way that
I've treated you.</i>

01:53:28.051 --> 01:53:29.894
<i>And if you come back,
I promise...</i>

01:53:30.053 --> 01:53:32.556
<i>I will spend every day
making it up to you.</i>

01:53:33.056 --> 01:53:36.902
<i>I will be the man that I
promised you I would be.</i>

01:53:39.479 --> 01:53:40.480
<i>I love you.</i>

01:53:41.398 --> 01:53:42.991
<i>Come home.</i>

01:53:47.738 --> 01:53:48.739
Here.

01:53:54.870 --> 01:53:56.471
<i>Regardless of
what you thought...</i>

01:53:56.538 --> 01:53:58.586
What does it say?

01:53:58.749 --> 01:54:00.171
<i>...I think
we can all agree...</i>

01:54:00.334 --> 01:54:01.711
Oh, my God.
You fucking killed it.

01:54:01.877 --> 01:54:02.924
<i>...there's more to him
than meets the eye.</i>

01:54:03.086 --> 01:54:04.207
They're going crazy for you.

01:54:04.212 --> 01:54:08.592
They disliked me, they
liked me, they hated me.

01:54:08.759 --> 01:54:10.261
And now they love me.

01:54:10.427 --> 01:54:13.271
...a <i>candor and an honesty
that's worthy of respect.</i>

01:54:13.430 --> 01:54:15.353
<i>He's certainly earned mine.</i>

01:54:16.183 --> 01:54:17.275
What is it?

01:54:20.103 --> 01:54:23.232
<i>I'm Sharon Schieber.
Good night.</i>

01:54:28.195 --> 01:54:30.869
Margo Dunne, this is a search
warrant for your property.

01:54:31.031 --> 01:54:33.125
I usually ignore
tipline calls...

01:54:33.283 --> 01:54:35.160
but a neighbor
was concerned about...

01:54:35.243 --> 01:54:37.871
a strange man
around your woodshed.

01:54:38.246 --> 01:54:39.246
Call Tanner.

01:54:39.289 --> 01:54:40.461
Okay. Fuck!

01:54:44.586 --> 01:54:46.054
Girlfriend's real cute,
Nick.

01:54:47.297 --> 01:54:48.378
Is that what this is about?

01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:51.768
I have treated
you more than fair...

01:54:51.843 --> 01:54:54.437
throughout this
entire investigation.

01:54:54.596 --> 01:54:56.769
I gave you the benefit of
the doubt over and over.

01:54:56.932 --> 01:54:58.452
Every time you said
something stupid...

01:54:58.475 --> 01:55:00.728
I thought,
"Maybe he's just stupid."

01:55:00.894 --> 01:55:03.317
But I was wrong.
That's what this is about.

01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:04.481
Are these the clubs
you don't play golf with?

01:55:04.648 --> 01:55:05.649
None of that is mine.

01:55:05.941 --> 01:55:07.409
None of this was
put here by me.

01:55:07.567 --> 01:55:10.992
Those are nice clubs. You got
the makings of a real man cave.

01:55:11.154 --> 01:55:14.158
Everything just waiting until
the wife goes away for good.

01:55:14.324 --> 01:55:15.416
Nick!

01:55:16.660 --> 01:55:18.037
Hey, you can't do that!

01:55:18.120 --> 01:55:19.588
Of course we can.

01:55:27.879 --> 01:55:30.348
Amy, it's time to move on.

01:55:30.507 --> 01:55:32.225
What can I do to help?

01:55:32.926 --> 01:55:34.348
I need some time to think.

01:55:34.511 --> 01:55:35.763
That's the last
thing you need.

01:55:35.846 --> 01:55:36.893
Desi...

01:55:37.055 --> 01:55:39.524
Twenty years,
you have kept me dangling.

01:55:39.683 --> 01:55:43.358
Finally, last night, you came
to me, and you chose me.

01:55:44.062 --> 01:55:45.279
Follow that instinct.

01:55:45.439 --> 01:55:47.862
Don't trust the instinct that
left you beaten and homeless...

01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:51.574
sleeping in your car,
fearing for your life.

01:55:54.906 --> 01:55:57.625
I'm not gonna
force myself on you.

01:56:00.036 --> 01:56:02.710
I understand what
you're saying, Desi.

01:56:03.957 --> 01:56:05.584
I do.

01:56:08.920 --> 01:56:10.922
I've been so mistreated
for so long.

01:56:13.592 --> 01:56:16.471
I've forgotten how to behave.

01:56:22.225 --> 01:56:24.398
I'll move in here
tomorrow...

01:56:24.561 --> 01:56:27.155
and we'll work
it out together.

01:56:29.232 --> 01:56:32.953
I just want you
to be you again.

01:56:40.785 --> 01:56:42.265
<i>They only took
Margo to fuck with you.</i>

01:56:42.329 --> 01:56:43.922
She's not spending another
fucking second in there.

01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:46.833
I'm gonna go in, and I'm
gonna tell them everything.

01:56:47.501 --> 01:56:49.253
What?

01:56:51.254 --> 01:56:52.756
We tell Boney very little.

01:56:52.923 --> 01:56:54.925
Without a body,
without a murder weapon...

01:56:55.091 --> 01:56:57.264
their only hope
is a confession.

01:56:57.427 --> 01:56:59.270
So, you let them
do all the talking.

01:56:59.429 --> 01:57:01.431
That way, we can
jump-start your defense.

01:57:01.598 --> 01:57:03.976
The truth is my defense.

01:57:09.898 --> 01:57:10.898
Recognize these?

01:57:10.941 --> 01:57:12.943
Yes. It's Amy's
anniversary present to me.

01:57:13.109 --> 01:57:14.782
Was that how she told you
she was pregnant, Nick?

01:57:14.945 --> 01:57:17.448
Mommy, Daddy, baby,
and that made you real mad?

01:57:17.948 --> 01:57:19.120
No.

01:57:20.367 --> 01:57:22.487
- Recognize this?
- Never seen that before in my life.

01:57:22.702 --> 01:57:25.956
It's Amy's diary. We found
this at your father's house.

01:57:27.958 --> 01:57:29.198
Is this your
wife's handwriting?

01:57:29.292 --> 01:57:31.169
- He's not a handwriting ex...
- Looks like it.

01:57:31.336 --> 01:57:32.462
Our experts
thought so, too.

01:57:33.797 --> 01:57:35.515
Do you wanna play
a little true or false?

01:57:36.258 --> 01:57:37.350
Sure.

01:57:37.509 --> 01:57:41.980
"And then he brushes the sugar
off my lips so he can taste me."

01:57:43.098 --> 01:57:45.100
Yeah, that's true.

01:57:46.351 --> 01:57:48.353
You thought
quinoa was a fish?

01:57:49.646 --> 01:57:50.989
That is also true, yes.

01:57:53.149 --> 01:57:55.151
She wanted to get pregnant,
you assaulted her.

01:57:55.318 --> 01:57:57.195
- I hit her?
- No, never happened.

01:57:57.362 --> 01:57:58.864
- "Pushed," it says "pushed."
- Absolutely not.

01:57:59.030 --> 01:58:00.122
I never touched her.

01:58:02.534 --> 01:58:04.161
She tried to buy a gun.

01:58:04.828 --> 01:58:06.705
I doubt that,
but I don't know.

01:58:08.123 --> 01:58:09.625
Shall I read the last entry?

01:58:09.791 --> 01:58:10.838
Sure.

01:58:12.127 --> 01:58:14.129
"This man may kill me."

01:58:14.296 --> 01:58:16.390
In her own words,
"This man may kill me."

01:58:16.548 --> 01:58:18.676
It's kind of
a convenient end note.

01:58:25.181 --> 01:58:26.478
For future reference...

01:58:26.641 --> 01:58:28.860
the truth, you are not
a handwriting expert.

01:58:29.019 --> 01:58:30.066
Okay, I know.

01:58:38.486 --> 01:58:40.329
Judy's missing handle.

01:58:41.865 --> 01:58:44.038
Big as a two-by-four, right?
Big as a club.

01:58:44.200 --> 01:58:46.828
We found this day one, in the
fireplace in your home office.

01:58:46.995 --> 01:58:49.464
We didn't know what the hell
it was, but fire in July?

01:58:49.539 --> 01:58:50.539
We bagged it.

01:58:50.582 --> 01:58:51.583
I've never seen
that before either.

01:58:51.750 --> 01:58:54.253
We just tested it. Fire
doesn't erase blood, Nick.

01:58:54.419 --> 01:58:56.513
So, finally,
Nicholas Dunne...

01:58:56.671 --> 01:58:58.173
you're under arrest
for the murder of your wife.

01:58:58.340 --> 01:58:59.432
Do not say another word.

01:58:59.591 --> 01:59:00.934
- What about my side?
- Nick!

01:59:14.272 --> 01:59:15.615
More coffee?

01:59:15.774 --> 01:59:17.572
I'd love it.

01:59:19.861 --> 01:59:23.365
Remember that time we skipped
school and drove to the Cape?

01:59:23.531 --> 01:59:25.954
Oh, God, yeah.
Lobster right from the ocean.

01:59:26.117 --> 01:59:27.744
This reminds me of that.

01:59:28.244 --> 01:59:29.917
Never-ending holiday.

01:59:31.456 --> 01:59:33.550
You're not bored?

01:59:33.708 --> 01:59:35.085
Desi, how could I be bored?

01:59:35.251 --> 01:59:37.595
You can discuss
18th-century symphonies...

01:59:37.754 --> 01:59:40.678
19th-century Impressionists,
quote Proust in French.

01:59:41.049 --> 01:59:45.054
Nick's idea of culture
was a reality TV marathon...

01:59:45.220 --> 01:59:47.097
with one hand
down his boxers.

01:59:49.099 --> 01:59:50.692
I really have to get going.

01:59:51.017 --> 01:59:54.362
But I will be back
just as soon as I can.

02:00:00.944 --> 02:00:02.036
My keys.

02:00:07.242 --> 02:00:09.244
Thank you.

02:00:14.999 --> 02:00:16.091
Ow!

02:00:20.463 --> 02:00:22.056
That's how the kids wear it.

02:01:22.859 --> 02:01:26.705
Dunne?
You got one hell of a lawyer.

02:01:29.532 --> 02:01:30.704
Hey-

02:01:31.117 --> 02:01:32.118
Are you okay?

02:01:32.202 --> 02:01:33.374
Yes. Are you?

02:01:33.536 --> 02:01:34.662
Yeah.

02:01:34.829 --> 02:01:36.706
Let's go.

02:01:38.541 --> 02:01:39.633
What does this mean?

02:01:39.793 --> 02:01:41.841
Well, you're out on bond.

02:01:42.003 --> 02:01:45.223
You can relax at home
while we prep for trial.

02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:52.722
Keep your head down.

02:02:08.154 --> 02:02:10.407
Tanner, is there
any fucking lead on Amy?

02:02:10.573 --> 02:02:12.575
I've got two of
my best guys on it.

02:02:13.076 --> 02:02:14.703
She's air.

02:02:16.746 --> 02:02:19.716
Come home, Amy.
I dare you.

02:03:16.931 --> 02:03:19.354
Mr. Collings is home.

02:03:19.517 --> 02:03:21.770
Hello, Mr. Collings.

02:03:21.936 --> 02:03:23.688
I've missed you.

02:03:23.855 --> 02:03:25.482
I've been thinking...

02:03:25.940 --> 02:03:28.113
- I don't wanna be without you.
- Oh.

02:03:28.818 --> 02:03:31.037
Stay with me.

02:03:31.195 --> 02:03:34.039
And when all this dies down, we'll
go to Greece, like you said.

02:03:34.198 --> 02:03:36.496
Octopus and Scrabble?

02:03:38.494 --> 02:03:40.622
How long do you
think until it's done?

02:03:40.788 --> 02:03:44.383
Not long. Six months for the trial.
Sentencing will be quick.

02:03:44.876 --> 02:03:45.923
He'll appeal.

02:03:46.002 --> 02:03:48.130
I can watch the rest
overseas.

02:04:05.521 --> 02:04:06.647
Go slowly.

02:04:06.731 --> 02:04:07.732
But I want it.

02:04:27.794 --> 02:04:29.637
Don't rush.

02:04:29.837 --> 02:04:31.931
Just do it.

02:04:40.390 --> 02:04:41.937
Harder.

02:06:20.490 --> 02:06:23.619
You fucking bitch.

02:06:32.335 --> 02:06:36.010
Don't you worry, you're
gonna have lots of babies.

02:06:37.632 --> 02:06:41.011
Her wounds are consistent with rape.
There was semen present.

02:06:41.177 --> 02:06:42.298
We'll make sure
it's a match.

02:06:42.345 --> 02:06:43.972
Yeah, it'll match.

02:06:44.138 --> 02:06:46.482
Thank you very much.

02:06:46.641 --> 02:06:48.018
What do you think?

02:06:48.184 --> 02:06:49.356
Are we pals again?

02:06:49.519 --> 02:06:52.864
Now that I know you didn't
murder your wife, yes.

02:06:52.939 --> 02:06:53.940
What do you think?

02:06:54.107 --> 02:06:57.031
Kidnapping?
The story's insane.

02:06:59.195 --> 02:07:01.539
She's on fairly
heavy painkillers.

02:07:01.697 --> 02:07:03.495
It's okay.
I want to help.

02:07:03.574 --> 02:07:05.121
Ms. Dunne, I know
what you've been through...

02:07:05.201 --> 02:07:07.329
so we'll keep this
very brief.

02:07:07.495 --> 02:07:09.873
Can you walk us
through what happened?

02:07:12.500 --> 02:07:15.128
That morning,
the doorbell rang.

02:07:16.003 --> 02:07:17.880
So normal.

02:07:18.047 --> 02:07:19.890
I opened the door.

02:07:20.508 --> 02:07:22.351
So strange.

02:07:22.969 --> 02:07:26.473
Since high school,
he won't ever go away.

02:07:26.639 --> 02:07:29.609
And I've just tried
to be nice to him.

02:07:29.767 --> 02:07:31.394
Answer his letters.

02:07:31.644 --> 02:07:33.646
Keep him calm.

02:07:35.064 --> 02:07:36.532
Oh, my God.

02:07:37.150 --> 02:07:38.652
Oh, I've encouraged him.

02:07:38.818 --> 02:07:40.616
You can't blame yourself.

02:07:42.238 --> 02:07:44.411
He pushed inside.

02:07:45.992 --> 02:07:48.040
And he grabbed me.

02:07:48.744 --> 02:07:51.839
But I got away,
and ran to the kitchen.

02:07:52.165 --> 02:07:53.883
And he clubbed me.

02:07:54.333 --> 02:07:55.630
I collapsed.

02:07:55.793 --> 02:07:59.718
That club was actually the handle
to a Punch and Judy puppet.

02:07:59.881 --> 02:08:01.303
Right.

02:08:02.216 --> 02:08:03.638
Treasure hunt.

02:08:05.553 --> 02:08:07.476
I'd hidden some
puppets at Go's...

02:08:07.638 --> 02:08:09.356
Then how did Desi
have that handle?

02:08:11.225 --> 02:08:13.148
I'd just found it.

02:08:13.895 --> 02:08:16.318
It must have fallen off.

02:08:16.439 --> 02:08:17.440
I...

02:08:18.232 --> 02:08:21.782
was holding it when Desi pushed in.
So, he got it from me.

02:08:21.944 --> 02:08:23.036
About that woodshed...

02:08:23.196 --> 02:08:24.869
He took me
to his lake house.

02:08:25.448 --> 02:08:27.041
Tied me to his bed.

02:08:27.200 --> 02:08:29.623
Back to the woodshed
real quick. Real quick.

02:08:29.785 --> 02:08:31.503
When you went to place
the puppets there...

02:08:31.662 --> 02:08:33.062
did you notice
that it was packed...

02:08:33.080 --> 02:08:34.127
Lots of stuff.

02:08:34.290 --> 02:08:36.668
Corresponding
to purchases made...

02:08:36.751 --> 02:08:38.594
on credit cards in
your husband's name.

02:08:38.753 --> 02:08:40.130
Nick and credit cards.

02:08:40.296 --> 02:08:42.719
He buys, I nag.
I don't know, probably.

02:08:42.882 --> 02:08:45.681
He hid a lot of stuff at Go's.
They're very close.

02:08:46.219 --> 02:08:50.440
Now, may I go back to where I
was being held prisoner...

02:08:50.598 --> 02:08:53.226
by a man with a history
of mental problems?

02:08:53.392 --> 02:08:54.473
Please continue, Ms. Dunne.

02:08:58.773 --> 02:09:00.867
Desi assaulted me that night.

02:09:01.817 --> 02:09:03.660
Every night.

02:09:04.779 --> 02:09:07.202
He tied me up like a dog.

02:09:08.574 --> 02:09:11.077
And then, he'd punish me.

02:09:12.995 --> 02:09:15.043
Starve me.

02:09:16.332 --> 02:09:18.255
Shave me.

02:09:19.877 --> 02:09:21.845
Sodomize me.

02:09:22.630 --> 02:09:24.348
There were cameras everywhere.

02:09:24.507 --> 02:09:27.477
Please find this.
Please find the tapes.

02:09:29.136 --> 02:09:32.356
She slit his throat
with a box cutter.

02:09:33.432 --> 02:09:35.526
How did she manage to get
a hold of a box cutter...

02:09:35.685 --> 02:09:38.279
if he had her tied up
the whole time?

02:09:39.230 --> 02:09:41.278
Can't you just be happy
your wife is home and safe?

02:09:42.066 --> 02:09:43.909
Amy, we found your diary.

02:09:44.068 --> 02:09:48.039
It contains many concerning allegations
of mental and physical abuse.

02:09:48.197 --> 02:09:51.076
Well, it's the ugly truth.

02:09:51.909 --> 02:09:53.411
Nick didn't want a baby.

02:09:55.246 --> 02:09:58.546
He has a temper.
We had money problems.

02:09:59.458 --> 02:10:00.459
But I love him.

02:10:00.626 --> 02:10:02.378
Then why did you
try to buy a gun?

02:10:04.338 --> 02:10:06.306
I'm sorry,
I feel myself fading.

02:10:06.465 --> 02:10:08.183
If I could just
clarify one thing...

02:10:08.342 --> 02:10:11.437
If this case had been left in
your deeply incompetent hands...

02:10:11.595 --> 02:10:13.472
my husband would
be on death row...

02:10:13.764 --> 02:10:17.519
and I'd be tied,
still, spread-eagle...

02:10:17.810 --> 02:10:21.485
Ms. Dunne, you've been very brave.
We're finished.

02:10:22.356 --> 02:10:24.404
Now, I have to ask you...

02:10:24.567 --> 02:10:27.411
do you feel safe going
home with your husband?

02:10:39.832 --> 02:10:42.335
We prayed to God, and God
has answered our prayers.

02:10:42.501 --> 02:10:43.753
Amy Dunne is home.

02:10:43.919 --> 02:10:45.887
Now, I know there are a lot
of questions and concerns...

02:10:46.047 --> 02:10:47.924
but for right now,
we wanna sit tight...

02:10:48.090 --> 02:10:49.808
and just be
thankful and grateful...

02:10:49.884 --> 02:10:53.013
for this miracle
on the Mississippi.

02:11:00.478 --> 02:11:02.276
Excuse me.
Excuse us, folks.

02:11:54.031 --> 02:11:55.248
We love you, Amy!

02:11:59.870 --> 02:12:01.588
All right,
you can stop pretending now.

02:12:01.747 --> 02:12:03.420
I'm not pretending.

02:12:04.125 --> 02:12:05.843
You were perfect.

02:12:06.460 --> 02:12:08.883
The Nick I saw on TV, that's
the Nick I fell in love with.

02:12:09.046 --> 02:12:10.263
You do know I was
just telling you...

02:12:10.339 --> 02:12:11.636
what you wanted
to hear, right?

02:12:11.799 --> 02:12:13.517
That's how well
you know me.

02:12:13.676 --> 02:12:16.304
You know me
in your marrow.

02:12:17.304 --> 02:12:18.772
Okay-

02:12:18.931 --> 02:12:22.276
You need to tell me
exactly what happened.

02:12:23.561 --> 02:12:24.813
Take off your clothes.

02:12:25.312 --> 02:12:28.532
I need to make sure
you're not wearing a wire.

02:12:41.829 --> 02:12:45.709
You killed someone, Amy.
You're a murderer.

02:12:45.875 --> 02:12:47.343
I'm a fighter.

02:12:47.501 --> 02:12:49.845
I fought my way
back to you.

02:12:50.004 --> 02:12:51.677
You killed a guy.

02:12:51.881 --> 02:12:53.724
You slashed his throat
with a box cutter.

02:12:53.883 --> 02:12:56.477
You went on
national television...

02:12:56.552 --> 02:12:58.554
and begged for me
to save your life.

02:12:59.138 --> 02:13:00.264
And I obliged.

02:13:00.431 --> 02:13:01.899
But I want that Nick.

02:13:02.224 --> 02:13:03.521
I'm leaving.

02:13:03.684 --> 02:13:06.312
You really think
that's smart?

02:13:06.896 --> 02:13:07.943
Shampoo.

02:13:10.691 --> 02:13:14.491
Wounded, raped wife battles her
way back to her husband...

02:13:14.653 --> 02:13:16.405
and he deserts her.

02:13:16.572 --> 02:13:17.619
They'll destroy you.

02:13:18.365 --> 02:13:19.742
Neighbors will shun you.

02:13:19.909 --> 02:13:24.130
And I'll make sure that no one
forgets the pain you caused me.

02:13:26.207 --> 02:13:31.304
I don't want anything to do
with your groupies outside.

02:13:31.879 --> 02:13:33.506
Once they go...

02:13:34.173 --> 02:13:35.174
I go.

02:13:35.341 --> 02:13:38.766
Give it the night.
Sleep on it.

02:13:55.611 --> 02:13:57.204
Was there ever a baby?

02:13:57.488 --> 02:13:59.582
There can be.

02:14:03.577 --> 02:14:04.578
Good night.

02:14:57.673 --> 02:14:59.346
Hey, Nick!

02:15:11.312 --> 02:15:12.564
Hello, handsome.

02:15:15.691 --> 02:15:17.443
Crepe?

02:15:18.027 --> 02:15:19.028
Sure.

02:15:19.111 --> 02:15:20.704
<i>She was his dream girl.</i>

02:15:20.863 --> 02:15:24.163
<i>And when this spoiled, rich, entitled
little boy couldn't have her...</i>

02:15:24.325 --> 02:15:25.702
<i>he took her.</i>

02:15:33.083 --> 02:15:34.426
You must be so proud.

02:15:41.675 --> 02:15:43.677
It's been four hours.

02:15:44.178 --> 02:15:47.022
Nick? Nick? What's next
for you and Amy?

02:15:51.185 --> 02:15:54.029
Right now,
it's all about our marriage.

02:15:54.855 --> 02:15:58.234
When two people love each other
and can't make that work...

02:15:58.400 --> 02:16:00.823
that's the real tragedy.

02:16:04.573 --> 02:16:06.621
Kiss my cheek.

02:16:12.956 --> 02:16:15.356
I can't believe that fucking
spider is America's sweetheart.

02:16:15.793 --> 02:16:17.887
She told me
she killed Desi.

02:16:18.045 --> 02:16:19.262
Not self-defense.
Murder.

02:16:19.421 --> 02:16:20.843
- Can't we get a wire?
- That's not gonna work.

02:16:21.006 --> 02:16:22.053
She told you once before.

02:16:22.216 --> 02:16:24.435
Yeah, because she had me strip
naked, and stand in the shower.

02:16:24.593 --> 02:16:27.722
I swear, you two are the most
fucked-up people I've ever known.

02:16:27.888 --> 02:16:29.356
And I specialize
in fucked-up.

02:16:29.598 --> 02:16:31.316
You and Amy
under the same roof?

02:16:31.475 --> 02:16:33.272
You should pitch that
as reality television.

02:16:33.894 --> 02:16:36.147
<i>Amy Dunne, and
the Miracle on the Mississippi.</i>

02:16:36.313 --> 02:16:38.691
<i>Nick and I have been
through some bad patches.</i>

02:16:38.857 --> 02:16:40.074
<i>We've had our dark days.</i>

02:16:40.234 --> 02:16:42.076
<i>But we thank you so much...</i>

02:16:42.568 --> 02:16:47.120
<i>for supporting us in our new life
together, for forgiving Nick.</i>

02:16:47.366 --> 02:16:50.960
<i>Really, your encouragement
means the world.</i>

02:16:51.120 --> 02:16:52.416
Oh, she's good.

02:16:52.579 --> 02:16:55.048
<i>Amazing Amy and
the Humbled Husband.</i>

02:16:55.207 --> 02:16:57.174
<i>The Real Housewives
of Branson.</i>

02:16:57.334 --> 02:16:58.380
Take care of
this guy, will you?

02:16:58.459 --> 02:17:00.021
I can't believe
you're just leaving now.

02:17:00.087 --> 02:17:01.509
You are not at risk anymore.

02:17:01.672 --> 02:17:03.049
I'm the definition
of "at risk."

02:17:03.257 --> 02:17:07.262
You got a book deal, a Lifetime
movie, you franchised The Bar.

02:17:07.428 --> 02:17:08.475
You may wanna thank her.

02:17:11.514 --> 02:17:12.937
Just don't piss her off.

02:17:13.517 --> 02:17:14.518
See you, guys-

02:17:16.895 --> 02:17:18.441
Elvis has left Missouri.

02:17:18.522 --> 02:17:19.722
She had to have
made a mistake.

02:17:19.732 --> 02:17:21.905
We need to check Amy's
story, piece by piece.

02:17:22.066 --> 02:17:23.943
Nick, I can't do anything.

02:17:24.361 --> 02:17:27.080
We had the national spotlight
on us, we stained the rug.

02:17:27.239 --> 02:17:28.959
The case is with the Feds now,
they're done.

02:17:28.991 --> 02:17:30.038
That doesn't mean
you have to be done.

02:17:30.450 --> 02:17:32.249
It does.

02:18:03.816 --> 02:18:05.285
What are you doing?

02:18:07.196 --> 02:18:08.664
Couldn't sleep.

02:18:08.822 --> 02:18:09.823
Come on...

02:18:10.115 --> 02:18:12.288
let me tuck you back in.

02:18:24.963 --> 02:18:27.591
You know you can
sleep with me, right?

02:18:29.675 --> 02:18:31.644
Yeah, it's just...

02:18:31.804 --> 02:18:33.147
I need more time.

02:18:33.347 --> 02:18:36.897
I would never,
ever hurt you.

02:18:38.684 --> 02:18:41.029
I do need you
to participate, though.

02:18:41.188 --> 02:18:43.361
I need you to do your part.

02:18:53.659 --> 02:18:54.660
Okay.

02:18:55.661 --> 02:18:58.129
Everything you have heard
about my wife...

02:18:58.288 --> 02:18:59.540
is a lie.

02:18:59.706 --> 02:19:03.802
She is a calculating,
murderous psychopath.

02:19:04.419 --> 02:19:05.841
And I have been complicit...

02:19:06.004 --> 02:19:07.129
Nick!

02:19:12.803 --> 02:19:14.805
Nick? Breakfast.

02:19:14.888 --> 02:19:15.888
Honey?

02:19:19.559 --> 02:19:21.904
We should hold hands.

02:19:22.062 --> 02:19:25.156
Not the entire time,
but on and off throughout.

02:19:26.566 --> 02:19:28.786
"So, Nick, how does it feel
to have your wife back?"

02:19:31.405 --> 02:19:33.156
"it's fantastic."

02:19:33.323 --> 02:19:34.763
"How many people
are lucky enough..."

02:19:34.782 --> 02:19:36.251
"to get a second
chance at love?"

02:19:36.410 --> 02:19:38.128
"Fantastic" is
a little flippant.

02:19:38.537 --> 02:19:39.538
"Amazing"?

02:19:39.705 --> 02:19:42.424
I need you to admit that
you got the credit cards...

02:19:42.583 --> 02:19:45.587
and that you hid all that stuff
at Go's and that you pushed me.

02:19:46.335 --> 02:19:49.385
I'm gonna need those
three things to feel safe.

02:19:50.591 --> 02:19:52.434
You have to own this, Nick.

02:19:53.218 --> 02:19:54.720
Don't worry.

02:19:54.803 --> 02:19:56.771
I know exactly what to say.

02:19:58.348 --> 02:20:00.100
Nick.

02:20:03.061 --> 02:20:05.689
What a beautiful home.

02:20:06.940 --> 02:20:09.489
I so appreciate
you giving us this time, Nick.

02:20:09.651 --> 02:20:11.699
You went on
national television...

02:20:11.862 --> 02:20:14.206
and told people that
I murdered my wife.

02:20:14.364 --> 02:20:15.490
I go where the story goes.

02:20:15.657 --> 02:20:18.501
You implied that I had carnal
relations with my sister.

02:20:18.660 --> 02:20:22.085
I didn't use the "I" word. I said
you two were "extremely close."

02:20:22.247 --> 02:20:26.923
You and a panel of nitwits
diagnosed me as a sociopath.

02:20:28.128 --> 02:20:29.880
Ice-breaker.

02:20:33.592 --> 02:20:35.265
To go with your robot dog.

02:20:35.427 --> 02:20:37.475
I'll go find Amy.

02:20:39.514 --> 02:20:41.608
She's downstairs.

02:20:44.102 --> 02:20:45.604
- What is it?
- It's for you.

02:20:45.771 --> 02:20:47.193
Open it.

02:20:47.481 --> 02:20:49.108
I don't need any
more gifts from you.

02:20:49.274 --> 02:20:50.992
Open it.

02:21:03.538 --> 02:21:05.085
I didn't touch you.

02:21:05.248 --> 02:21:06.249
You didn't need to.

02:21:06.333 --> 02:21:09.428
Bullshit.
That notice of disposal.

02:21:09.586 --> 02:21:10.963
I have that.
You threw it out.

02:21:11.129 --> 02:21:12.972
The notice, yes.

02:21:13.215 --> 02:21:14.216
I want a blood test.

02:21:14.758 --> 02:21:15.850
I want a paternity test.

02:21:16.635 --> 02:21:17.852
I love tests.

02:21:18.011 --> 02:21:19.729
You can teach those people
to hate me all you want.

02:21:19.888 --> 02:21:22.607
I don't care.
I am leaving you.

02:21:24.726 --> 02:21:27.320
I won't have to teach
your child to hate you.

02:21:27.479 --> 02:21:29.732
He'll do that
all by himself.

02:21:29.898 --> 02:21:31.775
You fucking cunt!

02:21:33.652 --> 02:21:35.905
I'm the cunt you married.

02:21:36.071 --> 02:21:37.744
The only time you
liked yourself...

02:21:37.906 --> 02:21:41.456
was when you were trying to be
someone this cunt might like.

02:21:41.618 --> 02:21:45.088
I'm not a quitter.
I'm that cunt.

02:21:48.834 --> 02:21:52.088
I've killed for you.
Who else can say that?

02:21:53.338 --> 02:21:55.761
You think you would be happy
with a nice Midwestern girl?

02:21:55.924 --> 02:21:58.643
No way, baby. I'm it.

02:21:58.802 --> 02:22:02.102
Look, you're delusional.
You're insane.

02:22:02.264 --> 02:22:03.766
Why would you
even want this?

02:22:04.141 --> 02:22:05.188
Yes, I loved you.

02:22:05.267 --> 02:22:08.612
And then all we did was resent each
other, and try to control each other.

02:22:08.770 --> 02:22:09.810
And cause each other pain.

02:22:10.313 --> 02:22:12.111
That's marriage.

02:22:14.776 --> 02:22:17.154
Now, I'm getting ready.

02:22:42.471 --> 02:22:45.441
<i>I can't watch you play house with
that thing for the next 18 years.</i>

02:22:45.599 --> 02:22:47.146
I can't just walk away.

02:22:47.309 --> 02:22:48.777
You could get custody.

02:22:48.935 --> 02:22:52.690
No, I won't.
And you know it.

02:22:52.856 --> 02:22:55.359
It's gonna be my child.
I'm not gonna leave it.

02:22:55.984 --> 02:22:57.657
You wanna stay.

02:22:57.819 --> 02:23:01.619
I have a responsibility. It's
not about what I want anymore.

02:23:01.782 --> 02:23:03.034
You wanna stay with her.

02:23:13.668 --> 02:23:14.715
You're breaking
my heart.

02:23:15.170 --> 02:23:18.674
Go, you're my voice
of reason.

02:23:18.840 --> 02:23:21.218
I need you with me on this.

02:23:21.384 --> 02:23:23.853
Of course I'm with you.

02:23:26.473 --> 02:23:30.478
I was with you
before we were even born.

02:23:32.229 --> 02:23:35.028
We've been
through the darkness.

02:23:35.565 --> 02:23:38.865
We've come out, united.

02:23:41.863 --> 02:23:44.036
We communicate.

02:23:46.326 --> 02:23:48.704
We're honest
with each other.

02:23:48.870 --> 02:23:50.372
Right?

02:23:52.290 --> 02:23:54.793
We're partners in crime.

02:23:58.004 --> 02:23:59.005
And?

02:24:00.882 --> 02:24:02.225
And?

02:24:05.720 --> 02:24:07.643
We're gonna be parents.

02:24:08.223 --> 02:24:10.976
Oh, my goodness!

02:24:11.393 --> 02:24:13.361
- Oh, how exciting!
- Thank you.

02:24:18.150 --> 02:24:20.528
<i>"What are you thinking?"</i>
