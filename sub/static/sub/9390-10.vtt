00:50.484 --> 00:54.085
Both his first and last names
are slang for "penis."

We interrupt this program

01:08.902 --> 01:09.934
$5,000?

01:09.936 --> 01:12.404
I could get that cave for the
front yard I've always wanted,

01:12.406 --> 01:14.839
and then tell people
not to go in there.

01:14.841 --> 01:16.474
(kids laughing)

01:16.476 --> 01:18.176
Hey, you kids stay
out of that cave!

Lois, tell him about
the whole stitches thing

Never mind, I'll tell it.

Lois was so wrecked,
they had to sew her up

01:38.365 --> 01:40.398
and open up a new vagina
right next to the first one.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.233
You know, kinda like
when they build a new bridge

01:42.235 --> 01:43.468
next to the old bridge,
and you're like,

01:43.470 --> 01:46.237
"Wow, I can't believe
I used to use the old one.

01:46.239 --> 01:47.005
Looks so unsafe."

08:52.798 --> 08:54.732
Is that... us?

08:54.734 --> 08:55.766
Yes, Peter.

08:55.768 --> 08:57.001
You were so handsome

08:57.003 --> 08:59.537
and it was such
a wonderful week.

08:59.539 --> 09:02.507
Hey, buddy, I think
that girl likes me.

09:02.509 --> 09:04.609
Of course she does.
She's your wife.

09:04.611 --> 09:05.877
Do you like her?

09:05.879 --> 09:07.912
I don't know.

09:07.914 --> 09:10.648
(squeals, laughs)

09:10.650 --> 09:11.382
(sighs)

09:11.384 --> 09:13.451
You know, this isn't going
to be easy, you guys.

09:13.453 --> 09:15.353
We're going to have
to re-teach your father

09:15.355 --> 09:16.687
everything
he's forgotten.

09:16.689 --> 09:19.190
Hey, have you heard
this awesome new song?

09:19.192 --> 09:19.657
No!

09:19.659 --> 09:20.958
♪ A well, a bird,
bird, bird ♪

09:20.960 --> 09:21.959
♪ B-bird's the word ♪

09:21.961 --> 09:23.261
♪ A well, a bird,
bird, bird ♪

09:23.263 --> 09:25.596
♪ B-bird's the word,
a well, a...♪

09:27.466 --> 09:29.233
This is called
a telephone, Peter.

09:29.235 --> 09:32.537
You use it to talk to people
who aren't in the house.

09:32.539 --> 09:33.271
There are others?

09:33.273 --> 09:36.574
Yes, there are over six billion
people in the world.

09:36.576 --> 09:37.675
Here, I'll show you.

09:37.677 --> 09:39.710
We'll call my parents.

09:39.712 --> 09:41.512
CARTER:
Hello?

09:41.514 --> 09:42.113
Hello.

09:42.115 --> 09:43.748
Who's this?
Who's this?

09:43.750 --> 09:45.349
Carter. Who's this?

09:45.351 --> 09:46.717
I don't know.

09:46.719 --> 09:48.719
Do you have my OxyContin?
What?

09:48.721 --> 09:50.922
Are you the guy?
I'm a guy.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.557
I want my drugs.

09:52.559 --> 09:53.157
What are drugs?

09:53.159 --> 09:57.762
I don't think this is the call
I was expecting.
(hangs up)

09:59.598 --> 10:02.400
Now, Peter, this is
your silverware.

10:02.402 --> 10:03.868
You see, this
is your fork.

10:03.870 --> 10:05.369
And this is a knife.

10:05.371 --> 10:06.904
That's not a knife.

10:06.906 --> 10:08.673
That's a knife.

10:08.675 --> 10:10.708
This is also a knife.

10:10.710 --> 10:11.475
Oh.

10:11.477 --> 10:12.944
Well, I'll be
on m' way.

10:12.946 --> 10:16.881
I want to see more of him,
and then suddenly none of him.

10:16.883 --> 10:18.015
Forever.

10:18.017 --> 10:20.785
(tires squealing, screeching)

10:23.222 --> 10:24.689
All right, you know what?

10:24.691 --> 10:25.556
This is not working.

10:25.558 --> 10:26.757
If you're going
to learn to drive,

10:26.759 --> 10:28.125
you're going to have
to practice first.

10:28.127 --> 10:30.995
Here, play "Grand Theft
Auto" for eight hours,

10:30.997 --> 10:34.599
and then we'll give
it another try.

10:43.508 --> 10:44.909
(tires squealing)

10:47.412 --> 10:49.046
So, you guys are
my best friends,

10:49.048 --> 10:50.881
and this is where
we hang out?

10:50.883 --> 10:51.916
That's right.

10:51.918 --> 10:53.551
I'm Quagmire,
and this is Joe.

10:53.553 --> 10:54.485
So, what do we do here?

10:54.487 --> 10:56.754
Well, we usually come here,
you buy us drinks

10:56.756 --> 10:58.856
and tell us what Lois'
nipples look like,

10:58.858 --> 11:00.391
like you
always do.

11:00.393 --> 11:01.259
Giggity-giggity.

11:01.261 --> 11:02.860
Yeah, but first,
you usually go over there

11:02.862 --> 11:05.930
and pull down
that blonde waitress's top.

11:07.065 --> 11:08.432
(woman screams)

11:08.434 --> 11:08.966
(loud slap)

11:08.968 --> 11:11.902
She screamed,
so I had to slap her.

11:16.074 --> 11:17.608
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

11:17.610 --> 11:19.944
Get nude. Get nude.
Please get nude.

11:19.946 --> 11:21.012
Please get nude.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.481
Peter, you don't
have to spy on me.

11:23.483 --> 11:24.782
You're my husband.

11:24.784 --> 11:26.384
Come on in.

11:26.386 --> 11:27.785
Oh, boy, no fooling?

11:27.787 --> 11:28.853
Oh, boy!

11:28.855 --> 11:29.553
Wait a minute.

11:29.555 --> 11:31.389
Something's happening
in my pants.

11:31.391 --> 11:32.456
In the front this time.

11:32.458 --> 11:33.724
That's all
right, Peter.

11:33.726 --> 11:35.826
It just means
you're excited.

11:35.828 --> 11:37.795
That's the way
it's supposed to be

11:37.797 --> 11:39.563
between a husband
and wife.

11:39.565 --> 11:41.599
It means you want
to make love.

11:41.601 --> 11:44.602
But I forget how
to make love.

11:44.604 --> 11:45.803
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

11:45.805 --> 11:47.438
That's okay.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.639
I'll show you.

11:48.641 --> 11:50.608
Just follow my lead.

11:51.076 --> 11:56.047
♪ It feels like the first time

11:56.049 --> 12:00.418
♪ It feels like
the very first time... ♪

12:16.168 --> 12:18.069
(moaning)

12:18.071 --> 12:21.572
Wow! That was what
they call sex?

12:21.574 --> 12:23.474
Yes, it was, Peter.

12:23.476 --> 12:24.709
Can we do it again?

12:24.711 --> 12:26.477
Huh? Huh? Can we?

12:26.479 --> 12:26.877
Wow!

12:26.879 --> 12:30.548
You're as excited as a porcupine
meeting a pineapple.

12:31.049 --> 12:34.585
Hey, good-looking,
where have you been all my life?

12:34.587 --> 12:36.821
(laughs)

12:40.592 --> 12:43.594
Morning, nice people who
I still don't know your names

12:43.596 --> 12:44.829
and who mean nothing to me.

12:44.831 --> 12:47.498
Well, I certainly hope
that doesn't apply to me,

12:47.500 --> 12:49.533
especially after
last night.

12:49.535 --> 12:51.602
You got a point
there, hot stuff.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.070
And if sex with the rest of you

12:53.072 --> 12:54.805
is half as good
as it was with her,

12:54.807 --> 12:58.008
then I think we're all gonna
get along just fine.

12:58.010 --> 12:58.576
Yay!

12:58.578 --> 13:01.178
Well, no, no, Peter, you can't
have sex with the kids.

13:01.180 --> 13:05.116
Well, I wish you'd told him that
before he lost his memory.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.016
(gasps)

13:06.018 --> 13:07.151
It was a joke!

13:07.153 --> 13:08.719
I was just
making a joke.

13:08.721 --> 13:10.154
That's your
sense of humor?

13:10.156 --> 13:12.256
I was just
kidding. God!

13:12.258 --> 13:13.224
Meg, that's awful.

13:13.226 --> 13:15.626
Geez, you open your mouth
for a joke once,

13:15.628 --> 13:17.595
and that's what
you come up with?

13:17.597 --> 13:18.696
That's messed
up, Meg.

13:18.698 --> 13:19.797
I was just trying to be funny.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.166
That wasn't funny.
That was just dark.

13:22.168 --> 13:23.868
Yeah, that's your <i>father.</i>

13:23.870 --> 13:24.835
Oh, get out, Meg!

13:24.837 --> 13:25.803
Get out of the kitchen!

13:25.805 --> 13:28.172
Go on! Get out!
Out! Out! Out!

13:28.174 --> 13:29.974
Out of the kitchen! Go on!

13:29.976 --> 13:31.642
Get out of here!

13:31.644 --> 13:33.411
(laughs)

13:36.214 --> 13:37.815
Oh, Peter,
there you are.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.550
I've been waiting.

13:39.552 --> 13:41.552
You ready
to have sex?

13:41.554 --> 13:42.086
You bet.

13:42.088 --> 13:44.088
Move over
so Tiffany and I have room.

13:44.090 --> 13:45.022
What?! Who the
hell is she?

13:45.024 --> 13:47.091
She's the woman
I'm gonna have sex with tonight.

13:47.093 --> 13:49.527
Oh, and don't worry
about getting me pregnant.

13:49.529 --> 13:50.361
I'm already pregnant.

13:50.363 --> 13:51.929
Peter, what's the
matter with you?

13:51.931 --> 13:54.765
You can't just have sex
with some random woman.

13:54.767 --> 13:55.766
Why the hell not?

13:55.768 --> 13:58.068
Because we're married.
Well, I'm sorry,

13:58.070 --> 13:59.136
but I don't remember
marrying anybody.

13:59.138 --> 14:02.773
Why the hell would I commit
to having sex with one person

14:02.775 --> 14:04.108
for the rest of my life?

14:04.110 --> 14:05.709
Because we love
each other.

14:05.711 --> 14:07.711
That's part of
being a family.

14:07.713 --> 14:10.281
It means being
responsible and faithful.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.049
Well, that doesn't sound
very fun.

14:12.051 --> 14:13.784
Well, if that's how you feel,

14:13.786 --> 14:16.654
then-then we no longer
have a family.

14:16.656 --> 14:17.521
Boy, I'm glad you said it.

14:17.523 --> 14:20.324
But this is my house,
and I'm not going anywhere.

14:20.326 --> 14:21.192
You don't have to.

14:21.194 --> 14:25.062
I'm leaving, and I'm
taking the kids with me.

14:25.764 --> 14:28.732
That's a beautiful necklace
you're wearing, Tiffany.

14:28.734 --> 14:29.366
Thank you.

14:29.368 --> 14:32.770
Is that what you do with your
Saved By the Bell money?

14:39.411 --> 14:42.646
Mom, I don't want to live
in a tiny, gross apartment.

14:42.648 --> 14:45.583
Well, I'm sorry, honey,
but we don't have a choice.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.651
Your father doesn't
remember his life,

14:47.653 --> 14:49.854
and he doesn't want us
to be a part of it,

14:49.856 --> 14:51.889
so we've just got
to move on.

14:51.891 --> 14:52.990
Oh, this is disgusting.

14:52.992 --> 14:53.958
I shouldn't be here.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.826
A baby doesn't belong
in the inner city

14:55.828 --> 14:58.662
any more than a baby
belongs on a plane.

14:58.664 --> 14:59.063
(crying)

14:59.065 --> 15:01.832
Shh. It's gonna be okay.
Gonna be okay.

15:01.834 --> 15:05.703
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Our in-flight movie this evening
is <i>Hancock.</i>

15:05.705 --> 15:07.705
Waa! Waa!

15:07.707 --> 15:11.175
Waa! Waa!

15:11.177 --> 15:13.744
(rock music plays loudly)

15:19.117 --> 15:21.018
Peter, what the hell
is all this?

15:21.020 --> 15:21.952
Well, I'm a bachelor,

15:21.954 --> 15:23.787
so I invited a bunch
of people over,

15:23.789 --> 15:25.956
and now I'm waiting
for them to leave.

15:25.958 --> 15:26.891
That's what bachelors do.

15:26.893 --> 15:28.025
Peter, I'm interested
in the redhead

15:28.027 --> 15:30.094
with the wooden arms
and legs over there.

15:30.096 --> 15:31.228
You think you
could introduce me?

15:31.230 --> 15:33.197
That's a table,
Seamus.
Don't point at her.

15:33.199 --> 15:34.732
Don't point.
She's looking.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.200
Oh, great. Now
I got to go in.

15:36.202 --> 15:37.601
Hey, I'm Seamus.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.003
Peter, you left your family
for this?

15:39.005 --> 15:41.038
Look, I don't know
what I was doing before,

15:41.040 --> 15:44.041
but this is the way
man was meant to live.

15:44.043 --> 15:45.242
I just know it.

15:45.244 --> 15:46.410
Check it out.

15:46.412 --> 15:48.112
(moaning)

15:48.114 --> 15:49.747
Don't you miss your family?

15:49.749 --> 15:50.915
What, that lady
and those kids?

15:50.917 --> 15:53.183
I don't even remember 'em.
How could I miss them?

15:53.185 --> 15:54.852
I almost don't want
to ask you out

15:54.854 --> 15:56.387
because I know
you're gonna say no.

15:56.389 --> 15:57.888
You want to go out?

15:57.890 --> 15:59.256
No? Okay.

I know, right?

16:23.916 --> 16:25.950
Gosh, you know, I was just
picking up a couple hams

16:25.952 --> 16:28.819
to take down to the shelter,

16:28.821 --> 16:30.321
buying food to make
dinner for your husband.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.756
No, actually, Glenn,
maybe you haven't heard,

16:32.758 --> 16:36.026

aren't together anymore.

16:42.068 --> 16:42.900
I want to hear
all about it.

16:42.902 --> 16:45.235
But listen, you know, I got
all this shopping to do,

16:45.237 --> 16:47.104
so you want to stop by
tomorrow night?

16:47.106 --> 16:48.772
I'll just whip
something up.

16:48.774 --> 16:49.406
Well, sure.

16:49.408 --> 16:52.109
You know,
that sounds nice, Glenn.

16:53.511 --> 16:55.179
Holy smokes,
this is a sure thing.

16:55.181 --> 16:57.781
Like the end
of a Mexican wedding.

17:06.925 --> 17:07.725
Aw, crap, we're out of milk.

17:07.727 --> 17:10.294
I'm gonna run next door
to the airport and get some.

17:10.296 --> 17:12.963
Hey, when you're over there,
can you get some rodent traps?

17:12.965 --> 17:15.366
We got a giant mutant rat
living under the sink.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.401
I'm just gonna hide
under the sink

17:17.403 --> 17:18.769
till y'all go to sleep.

17:18.771 --> 17:21.438
Then I'm gonna come out
and make my poops in your Kix.

17:21.440 --> 17:22.973
Hey, Stewie,
is Lois back yet?

17:22.975 --> 17:24.541
I've been trying
to get a hold of her.

17:24.543 --> 17:26.944
She went to Quagmire's
for dinner.

17:26.946 --> 17:28.212
What?!

17:31.149 --> 17:33.283
Oh, that was a
delicious dinner, Glenn.

17:33.285 --> 17:34.752
I didn't know
you could cook.

17:34.754 --> 17:37.755
Well, when a fella's been alone
as long as I have,

17:37.757 --> 17:39.289
he learns
to take care of himself.

17:39.291 --> 17:41.091
Well, you're a
very sweet friend,

17:41.093 --> 17:43.460
and you're so good to
listen to my troubles.

17:43.462 --> 17:45.729
Oh, I could listen
for hours, Lois.

17:45.731 --> 17:46.397
Phew! Boy, you know,

17:46.399 --> 17:50.868
I don't know how a half a glass
of wine got me so light-headed.

17:50.870 --> 17:52.069
I better lie down.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.971
You want me to
help you upstairs?

17:53.973 --> 17:56.640
Oh, my God,
you are a saint!

17:58.810 --> 18:01.378
No, I-I think I can make it
from here. I-I...

18:01.380 --> 18:03.280
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

18:03.282 --> 18:05.883
(both laughing)

18:05.885 --> 18:06.984
Whoops!

18:06.986 --> 18:09.253
Professor Klutz,
the doctor is in.

18:09.255 --> 18:10.187
(laughs)

18:10.189 --> 18:12.389
Oh, where is
this heading?

18:14.059 --> 18:15.793
Oh, hiya, Brian.

18:15.795 --> 18:16.894
All right, Peter,
now I know

18:16.896 --> 18:17.928
your head is still
a blank slate,

18:17.930 --> 18:19.897
but you got to listen
to me when I say...

18:19.899 --> 18:22.266
Wait. Did you just
call me Brian?

18:22.268 --> 18:22.800
Oh, yeah.

18:22.802 --> 18:23.967
You've got
your memory back?
Uh-huh.

18:23.969 --> 18:28.305
Happened yesterday on my way
back from the grocery store.

18:28.307 --> 18:29.673
Hi, Peter.

18:30.909 --> 18:33.277
Hey, you just snubbed me
in front of my own house.

18:33.279 --> 18:34.845
I thought we'd come
to an understanding.

18:34.847 --> 18:37.948
Look, fella, I don't know
who you are and I don't want to,

18:37.950 --> 18:40.317
so why don't you just go back
to your crabgrass?

18:40.319 --> 18:43.487
This happens to be
fresh Marathon Sod!

18:43.988 --> 18:46.290
Oh, man, I just got
my memory back.

18:46.292 --> 18:50.461
And as I recall,
I don't really care for you!

18:50.463 --> 18:52.396
Wait a minute.
Who are you?

18:52.398 --> 18:53.430
Hey, I know you!

18:53.432 --> 18:54.932
What's your beef, stranger?

18:54.934 --> 18:57.201
Well, if it isn't
my old nemesis!

18:57.203 --> 18:59.870
I was just lucky he had
an odd number of objects.

18:59.872 --> 19:01.071
Why the hell
didn't you tell anybody?

19:01.073 --> 19:03.140
Well, I figured I could
enjoy the bachelor life

19:03.142 --> 19:05.275
for a few more days
before getting Lois back.

19:05.277 --> 19:07.277
Well, you may have waited
too long already.

19:07.279 --> 19:08.512
Lois is on a date
with Quagmire,

19:08.514 --> 19:11.048
and you've got to stop her
before something happens.

19:11.050 --> 19:12.883
What?! Oh, my God! Where is she?

19:12.885 --> 19:14.318
She's next door at his house.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.552
And you better get there quick,

19:15.554 --> 19:17.421
because with Quagmire,
sex is inevitable.

19:17.423 --> 19:19.289
Like a fat guy ordering dessert

19:19.291 --> 19:20.958
when everyone else wants
to leave.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.127
So, does anyone
want dessert?

19:23.129 --> 19:24.394
Ah, I couldn't
eat another bite.

19:24.396 --> 19:27.164
No. I got to get home
for the sitter.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.265
I'll have
the soufflé.

19:28.267 --> 19:29.533
That takes
45 minutes.

19:29.535 --> 19:31.201
That's okay.

19:34.139 --> 19:35.906
Oh, I can't believe
we're doing this,

19:35.908 --> 19:38.408
but I got to say,
it feels kind of right.

19:38.410 --> 19:40.077
I know, it's so
weird, right?

19:40.079 --> 19:42.012
I mean, it's... I mean,
it's, like, fast.

19:42.014 --> 19:45.449
I mean, it's fast, but it feels,
like, okay, you know?

19:45.451 --> 19:46.617
I mean, like,
isn't that crazy?

19:46.619 --> 19:49.319
It's like this adventure
that we're having together.

19:49.321 --> 19:52.122
I know. That's exactly
how I feel.

19:52.124 --> 19:54.024
I mean, it's a little strange,

19:54.026 --> 19:56.360
but if Peter's never
coming back to me,

19:56.362 --> 19:57.895
it's at least nice to know

19:57.897 --> 20:00.364
I'm in the arms
of a trusted friend.

20:00.366 --> 20:03.967
You... You trust me?

20:05.103 --> 20:06.136
Uh-oh.

20:06.138 --> 20:07.504
Wha...? Is something wrong?

20:07.506 --> 20:08.906
I-I-I don't know.

20:08.908 --> 20:11.475
I'll be right back.

20:11.477 --> 20:13.377
(rhythmic whooshing)

20:13.379 --> 20:14.545
Damn it!

20:14.547 --> 20:16.280
Lois!

20:16.282 --> 20:17.147
Peter?!

20:17.149 --> 20:18.215
What-What are you doing here?

20:18.217 --> 20:20.651
I got my memory back,
and I love you, Lois.

20:20.653 --> 20:22.486
I want you and the kids back.

20:22.488 --> 20:24.021
I want our old life back.

20:24.023 --> 20:25.088
(Lois laughs)

20:25.090 --> 20:26.356
I don't believe it!

20:26.358 --> 20:27.925
Sweetheart, it's you!

20:27.927 --> 20:29.026
You're back!

20:29.028 --> 20:30.227
QUAGMIRE:
Oh! Damn it!

20:30.229 --> 20:32.329
I'm back, Lois, and I'm sorry.

20:32.331 --> 20:35.165
I treated you so badly,
but I hope you know

20:35.167 --> 20:37.501
it-it was only because
I wasn't myself.

20:37.503 --> 20:39.570
I didn't just lose my memory.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.038
I lost my mind.

20:41.040 --> 20:41.939
Clear!

20:41.941 --> 20:43.473
(electrical buzzing)

20:43.475 --> 20:44.141
Damn it!

20:44.143 --> 20:46.043
Oh, my God, Peter,
I don't care!

20:46.045 --> 20:47.010
I don't care.

20:47.012 --> 20:49.012
I'm just overjoyed
to have you back!

20:49.014 --> 20:50.147
Let's go home!

20:50.149 --> 20:52.216
(electrical buzzing)

20:52.218 --> 20:53.617
QUAGMIRE:
Damn it!

20:53.619 --> 20:55.018
(buzzing)
Damn it.

20:55.020 --> 20:56.186
(buzzing)
Damn it!

20:56.188 --> 20:58.055
(Quagmire sobbing)
