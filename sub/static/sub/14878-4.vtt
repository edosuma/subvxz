00:24.268 --> 00:26.470
<i>Guten morgen.
How was your flight?</i>

00:26.537 --> 00:28.605
Like a giant nursery
ward in the sky.

00:28.673 --> 00:30.407
I got ten minutes of shut-eye max.

00:30.475 --> 00:33.543
Well, who said our
career isn't glamorous?

00:33.611 --> 00:35.479
Now I got to turn
around and fly right back.

00:35.546 --> 00:36.947
Any chance of upgrading
out of coach?

00:37.015 --> 00:38.348
You'll have to take that up

00:38.416 --> 00:39.850
With the appropriations committee.

00:39.917 --> 00:41.218
Good luck with that on a Sunday.

00:41.285 --> 00:44.221
Come on, auggie.
I'll be fighting the jet stream.

00:44.288 --> 00:45.922
Hey, anytime you
want to switch places,

00:45.990 --> 00:47.391
Just let me know.

00:47.458 --> 00:49.693
Someone's a little
cheeky this morning.

00:49.761 --> 00:51.361
Too bad-- I was gonna
get you a souvenir.

00:51.429 --> 00:52.863
Yeah?

00:52.930 --> 00:54.364
Yeah, a saint bernard--

00:54.432 --> 00:56.600
Stuffed, of course.

00:56.667 --> 00:58.568
Kind of remind me of you.

00:58.636 --> 01:00.337
Great. I remind you of cujo.

01:00.405 --> 01:01.705
It's the slobbering, isn't it?

01:01.773 --> 01:04.641
Yeah, that, and they're
cute and dependable,

01:04.709 --> 01:07.511
And when you're feeling low,
they bring you booze.

01:10.481 --> 01:13.150
It's my contact. Wish me luck.

01:13.217 --> 01:14.651
good luck.

02:22.137 --> 02:23.971
At the end of the day,
the cia is acting in our name.

02:24.039 --> 02:26.741
We need to demand
more transparency.

02:27.458 --> 02:29.292
I was personally
assured by the director

02:29.360 --> 02:31.795
Of clandestine services himself,
arthur campbell,

02:31.863 --> 02:33.864
That things would be different
under this new regime.

02:33.931 --> 02:35.365
What evidence have we seen

02:35.433 --> 02:37.100
That anything has actually changed?

02:37.168 --> 02:38.869
What are you doing?

02:38.936 --> 02:41.038
Oh, I couldn't help it.
I had to watch it.

02:41.105 --> 02:44.274
Give me that. Give it.

02:44.342 --> 02:46.309
You promised no david gregory.

02:46.377 --> 02:47.811
She mentioned my name.

02:47.879 --> 02:49.880
It's just noise, arthur.

02:49.947 --> 02:51.381
No, plus,
it's like she's being cc'd

02:51.449 --> 02:52.849
On every piece of paper.

02:52.917 --> 02:56.753
I thought we agreed no
shoptalk until noon today.

02:56.821 --> 02:59.523
Just tell me you're plugging
any leaks from your division.

02:59.590 --> 03:02.059
I will find the leaks.

03:02.126 --> 03:04.594
Trust me.

03:04.662 --> 03:06.363
Now, are you gonna take advantage

03:06.431 --> 03:07.964
Of my largesse already,

03:08.032 --> 03:10.467
Or do I have to find someone
who appreciates me more?

03:10.535 --> 03:12.669
Toast soldiers.

03:12.737 --> 03:15.138
Mm-hmm, with one
soft-boiled egg--

03:15.206 --> 03:16.840
Just the way you like it.

03:16.908 --> 03:18.308
I also brought you the paper.

03:18.376 --> 03:20.544
Aw...Oh.

03:20.611 --> 03:21.878
It's very light.

03:21.946 --> 03:23.280
That's because I shredded

03:23.347 --> 03:25.449
Everything related to geopolitics.

03:25.516 --> 03:27.317
You redacted the sports page.

03:27.385 --> 03:28.985
I know how you get
about the nationals.

03:29.053 --> 03:30.754
They got smoked, didn't they?

03:30.822 --> 03:32.389
I'm not talking.

03:32.457 --> 03:34.458
Yeah, well...

03:34.525 --> 03:35.959
I have ways of getting
it out of you.

03:36.027 --> 03:37.194
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:37.261 --> 03:38.562
Oh! Ah!

03:45.403 --> 03:46.903
- Ignore that.
- Ignore what?

03:46.971 --> 03:48.472
That.

03:48.539 --> 03:51.241
Try to ignore this. - I can't...

03:51.309 --> 03:56.847
I really can't...

03:56.914 --> 03:58.215
Yeah.

03:58.282 --> 03:59.449
Yeah.

03:59.517 --> 04:01.218
No.

04:01.285 --> 04:02.619
It's annie.

04:02.687 --> 04:05.255
The swiss authorities
report no casualties,

04:05.323 --> 04:07.424
But a handful of people have
been rushed to the hospital

04:07.492 --> 04:08.992
With injuries.

04:09.060 --> 04:11.561
As of yet, no terrorist group
has taken responsibility.

04:11.629 --> 04:13.296
I'll see you in 15.

04:13.364 --> 04:15.866
It just a run-of-the-mill
brush pass.

04:15.933 --> 04:17.534
Just tell me we didn't
pull her off the farm

04:17.601 --> 04:21.404
Before she learned
how to go to ground.

04:21.471 --> 04:24.107
Hey, are you all right?
The bomb--

04:24.175 --> 04:25.475
I'm fine, I think.

04:25.543 --> 04:27.010
You ever try and disguise
a government-issue

04:27.078 --> 04:29.079
Titanium briefcase
on the run before?

04:29.147 --> 04:32.215
I can assure you-- it's not easy.

04:32.283 --> 04:34.451
All right, so you've got
the package-- which one?

04:34.519 --> 04:36.753
Mine. Ours.

04:36.821 --> 04:38.588
And your 20?

04:38.656 --> 04:42.058
I'm in town, on foot,
on my way to the turk's.

04:42.126 --> 04:43.994
That's still the backup, correct?

04:44.061 --> 04:45.695
That would be our backup, yes.

04:45.763 --> 04:48.131
They wanted a briefcase.

04:48.199 --> 04:50.600
Think it might be time to read
me in on what I'm carrying here?

04:50.668 --> 04:52.235
That information has
not gone vertical yet.

04:52.303 --> 04:53.737
Tell me what happened
with the pass.

04:53.805 --> 04:55.505
Did you establish a
visual with the contact?

04:55.573 --> 04:57.774
- Yeah, with both of them.
- Both of them?

04:57.842 --> 05:00.043
Seems like orange wristbands
and metal briefcases

05:00.111 --> 05:01.845
Are all the rage in zurich, auggie.

05:01.913 --> 05:03.780
It's getting hard to tell
who's on my team out here.

05:03.848 --> 05:06.516
I am, okay? I'm on your team.

05:06.584 --> 05:08.585
I'm with you all the way home.

05:11.088 --> 05:12.856
I think I've been made.

05:12.924 --> 05:14.624
I'm gonna have to
dead-drop this package.

05:14.692 --> 05:15.992
Annie...

05:16.060 --> 05:16.960
Yeah, well,
that's the protocol, right,

05:17.028 --> 05:19.496
When things go tango uniform?

05:19.564 --> 05:22.532
Yes, yes, that's the protocol,
but we don't have one vetted.

05:25.803 --> 05:28.038
Annie?

05:34.045 --> 05:35.378
Hey, can you make it to the turk's?

05:35.446 --> 05:37.814
That's not an option right now.

05:37.882 --> 05:39.182
Okay. Do what you have to do.

06:23.127 --> 06:24.461
What's the word on annie?

06:24.528 --> 06:27.564
En route to the turk.
Clear head, wits about her.

06:27.632 --> 06:30.767
Good. And the package?

06:30.835 --> 06:33.670
She had to drop it.

07:17.982 --> 07:19.916
There's an empty
safe house nearby.

07:19.984 --> 07:22.218
I can take you there now.
Thank you.

07:22.286 --> 07:24.821
- What's that?
- Oh, I...

07:24.889 --> 07:27.090
I must have forgotten.

07:27.158 --> 07:28.925
Now your shoes, please.

07:28.993 --> 07:32.228
- My shoes?
- Your passport, any I.D.

07:32.296 --> 07:33.496
They are no good to you anymore.

07:46.811 --> 07:49.079
He's expecting me.

07:52.049 --> 07:53.383
Hello, bill.

07:53.451 --> 07:55.085
Ken.

07:55.152 --> 07:56.686
David.

07:56.754 --> 07:59.622
Maybe I should come back later.
No, we're all family here.

07:59.690 --> 08:02.158
Saves me from catching
everyone up one at a time.

08:02.226 --> 08:04.327
Okay, then.

08:04.395 --> 08:06.963
Here's what we know.

08:07.031 --> 08:09.165
Fedpol grabbed this image
off the closed circuit

08:09.233 --> 08:10.667
Just prior to the bomb going off.

08:10.735 --> 08:13.870
The briefcase matches the
shrapnel from the explosion.

08:13.938 --> 08:15.672
Do we have enough
for a visual I.D.?

08:15.740 --> 08:17.440
They matched it to the passport.

08:17.508 --> 08:19.743
S.A.P. Is looking
for a gayle beacham

08:19.810 --> 08:21.444
From scarborough, ontario.

08:21.512 --> 08:22.912
She already made it to the turk,

08:22.980 --> 08:24.514
So we're good there,

08:24.582 --> 08:25.982
But we need to get
her out of zurich.

08:26.050 --> 08:27.517
What's the status
of the briefcase?

08:27.585 --> 08:28.918
It's been dead-dropped.

08:28.986 --> 08:30.720
Walker's confident
it's secure, for now.

08:30.788 --> 08:32.722
We have some good
news from tel aviv.

08:32.789 --> 08:34.657
Their operative, eyal lavin...

08:34.725 --> 08:36.558
He also escaped with his package.

08:36.626 --> 08:38.495
So for now, there hasn't
been anything compromised.

08:40.664 --> 08:43.366
I'm sorry, bill.
Did I say something funny?

08:43.433 --> 08:46.069
- Nothing's been compromised?
- That's right.

08:46.137 --> 08:49.205
Now, I've been constructing a
plan for walker's extraction.

08:49.273 --> 08:50.807
From what I understand,

08:50.875 --> 08:53.543
We have three active assets
operating in zurich canton--

08:53.611 --> 08:55.278
Thank you, joan.

08:55.346 --> 08:59.149
Ken's gonna be
coordinating extraction.

08:59.216 --> 09:01.418
But annie's my operative.

09:01.485 --> 09:03.853
I'm not gonna jeopardize
the safety of my operatives

09:03.921 --> 09:05.722
In the field through
contact with your division.

09:05.790 --> 09:07.524
What are you talking about?

09:07.591 --> 09:09.459
Where are we on
the liza hearn leak?

09:11.829 --> 09:14.998
We're proceeding as scheduled,

09:15.066 --> 09:17.734
Diligently, systematically.

09:17.802 --> 09:20.203
I'm sorry. Is this really the time?

09:20.271 --> 09:23.339
We have an operative
out there in the dark.

09:23.407 --> 09:25.408
Is this really the time to
focus our energy on the leak?

09:25.476 --> 09:27.310
The d.P.D.'s been compromised.

09:27.378 --> 09:29.279
I'm wondering whether you're
too close to your people

09:29.346 --> 09:31.114
To prosecute this fully.

09:31.182 --> 09:33.116
Bill's gonna initiate a
company-wide investigation

09:33.184 --> 09:35.752
Starting today with the d.P.D.

09:35.820 --> 09:39.322
Are we all on the same page?

09:39.390 --> 09:41.124
Absolutely.

09:59.944 --> 10:03.913
You can come up now.

10:03.981 --> 10:06.883
Apartment 503-- the towels
and bedding should be clean,

10:06.951 --> 10:08.518
But I cannot make any promises.

10:08.586 --> 10:13.022
Okay. Um, is there milk?

10:13.090 --> 10:15.191
For the mac and cheese?

10:15.259 --> 10:16.960
You can make do th water.

10:17.027 --> 10:19.562
Okay.

10:22.766 --> 10:23.967
I will bring you a new passport

10:24.034 --> 10:25.835
As soon as I cobble it.

10:27.571 --> 10:30.874
Isn't this where you tell
me everything's gonna be okay?

10:30.941 --> 10:32.642
I am just a bridge
agent and a cobbler.

10:32.710 --> 10:34.444
I'm not a handler. - Meaning...?

10:34.512 --> 10:35.712
Meaning I do not
traffic in false hope

10:35.779 --> 10:36.980
And baseless reassurance.

10:37.047 --> 10:39.983
Okay, then.

10:40.050 --> 10:41.951
- The hair dye-
- hold it to your face.

10:42.019 --> 10:43.686
I want to check the color.

10:45.756 --> 10:48.391
What do you think?

10:48.459 --> 10:50.560
In case the color
does not flatter you...

10:50.628 --> 10:54.264
- Oh...
- Better this than that hat.

11:32.636 --> 11:36.039
You're my contact.
What are you doing here?

11:36.106 --> 11:38.890
I should ask you
the same question.

11:51.254 --> 11:53.042
I don't get this.

11:53.110 --> 11:55.111
We get tasked with a simple
brush pass-- in and out--

11:55.179 --> 11:57.180
In a presumably secure airport,

11:57.247 --> 11:58.948
Then things go sideways.

11:59.016 --> 12:01.384
I go my way. You go yours.
I get to ground.

12:01.452 --> 12:04.086
Hold on a second.
You're already here?

12:04.154 --> 12:05.922
It's funny how
things happen, huh?

12:05.989 --> 12:08.524
Why would cia and mossad
share the same safe house?

12:08.592 --> 12:09.859
I don't know.
Maybe for the same reason

12:09.927 --> 12:13.463
We both fly coach
instead of first class.

12:13.530 --> 12:15.231
You did fly coach, right?

12:15.299 --> 12:17.867
This doesn't make any sense.

12:17.935 --> 12:19.535
Come on, stop making this seem

12:19.603 --> 12:21.103
More random than it actually is.

12:21.171 --> 12:23.206
<i>What, you've never seen munich?</i>

12:23.273 --> 12:25.341
You want to tell me what
you're doing with that thing?

12:25.409 --> 12:29.312
Pass me that foil.

12:29.379 --> 12:30.913
There's only one bed.

12:30.981 --> 12:32.415
<i>That's all we need, neshama.</i>

12:32.483 --> 12:34.050
Come on, think of it as kismet.

12:34.117 --> 12:36.085
We shack up here for a few days.

12:36.153 --> 12:37.487
We let things die down,

12:37.554 --> 12:39.789
And then we do what we were
brought together to do.

12:39.857 --> 12:41.891
Which is what exactly?

12:41.959 --> 12:43.493
Exchange briefcases, of course.

12:43.560 --> 12:44.861
You want to tell me where yours is?

12:44.928 --> 12:48.331
- It's somewhere safe.
- This is somewhere safe.

12:48.398 --> 12:50.233
That's why they call
it a safe house.

12:50.300 --> 12:52.668
Where else is safe? - It got hot.

12:52.736 --> 12:55.404
I had to drop it, so...

12:55.472 --> 12:56.939
That's how they
teach you in the cia?

12:57.007 --> 12:58.941
Not to get caught with
compromising materials?

12:59.009 --> 13:00.877
Yeah. It's basic cia protocol.

13:00.944 --> 13:03.579
Protocol?

13:03.647 --> 13:05.681
I take it mossad doesn't
have the same procedure?

13:05.749 --> 13:09.352
A mossad man never separates
from his package, ever.

13:12.723 --> 13:14.657
<i>You're just a jobnikit,
aren't you?</i>

13:14.725 --> 13:16.092
All this talk about protocol,

13:16.159 --> 13:17.593
It's like you're sitting
at a desk pushing paper.

13:17.661 --> 13:20.062
I'm not a paper pusher.
I've done fieldwork before.

13:20.130 --> 13:21.831
Yeah? How much?

13:21.899 --> 13:24.300
Plenty.

13:27.237 --> 13:28.804
You made a police
scanner out of that thing?

13:28.872 --> 13:30.673
Yeah. In case you
speak only american,

13:30.741 --> 13:32.074
What they're saying is--

13:32.142 --> 13:33.676
I know. The swiss
security apparatus

13:33.744 --> 13:35.578
Is looking for you and me.

13:39.216 --> 13:40.416
At least we're in a
friendly country.

13:40.484 --> 13:41.984
Friendly?

13:42.052 --> 13:43.319
A colleague of mine
is in prison here

13:43.387 --> 13:44.820
For five years for
an act of espionage

13:44.888 --> 13:45.922
No different than this.

13:45.989 --> 13:47.757
That's not gonna be my fate.

13:47.824 --> 13:49.225
I'm gonna go take a shower.

13:49.293 --> 13:53.229
Try not to broadcast our
location while I'm in there.

14:18.188 --> 14:21.357
Pretty cloak and dagger, no?

14:21.425 --> 14:23.526
Shouldn't you be feeding
the pigeons or something?

14:23.594 --> 14:25.194
You apparently
think this is funny.

14:25.262 --> 14:26.862
Yes, I do.

14:26.930 --> 14:28.698
Not as funny as if you were also
wearing a trench coat, but...

14:28.765 --> 14:32.935
You mentioned me by name.
You broke the rule, liza.

14:33.003 --> 14:34.470
It's unwritten, arthur.

14:34.538 --> 14:36.405
The dci and the director
of public affairs--

14:36.473 --> 14:38.174
The only names ever
spoken in public.

14:38.241 --> 14:40.242
It's not like anyone can't
find you on the org chart.

14:40.310 --> 14:43.346
What's your endgame here?

14:43.413 --> 14:45.014
You getting me pushed out the door?

14:45.082 --> 14:46.816
Don't you think
you're overreacting?

14:46.883 --> 14:49.218
If I'm gone, there will be
another henry wilcox moving in,

14:49.286 --> 14:50.620
Blacking out the windows,

14:50.687 --> 14:52.121
Installing floor-to-ceiling drapes.

14:52.189 --> 14:55.057
Good luck with your
transparency then.

14:55.125 --> 14:57.193
I've heard this
song before, arthur,

14:57.260 --> 14:58.761
How all you need is
a little more time

14:58.829 --> 15:00.963
To gradually change the culture.

15:01.031 --> 15:02.865
But nothing ever happens.

15:02.933 --> 15:05.034
I'm more of a rip the
band-aid off type of girl.

15:05.102 --> 15:07.670
I can play rip the
band-aid off too.

15:07.738 --> 15:10.873
Trust me when I say this-
my version hurts more.

15:20.917 --> 15:24.553
Are they with you?

15:24.621 --> 15:26.555
It must be hard to
level empty threats

15:26.623 --> 15:30.026
And pretend to be a good
guy at the same time.

15:30.093 --> 15:32.428
You break any more rules,
written or unwritten,

15:32.496 --> 15:35.531
You put any of my people
anywhere in jeopardy,

15:35.599 --> 15:39.869
I'll let you judge for yourself
how empty my threats are.

15:45.142 --> 15:46.509
I don't know about the pigeons,

15:46.576 --> 15:47.943
But the squirrels go
crazy for that stuff.

15:52.582 --> 15:55.151
If you were mossad,
where would you stash your briefcase?

15:55.218 --> 15:59.522
Hold on. I'm pulling
his 201 up now.

15:59.589 --> 16:01.557
All right...

16:01.625 --> 16:04.360
Eyal lavin.

16:04.428 --> 16:07.897
Three years I.D.F.
-- Field intelligence squad--

16:07.964 --> 16:11.100
Then two years with magav
in the golan heights

16:11.168 --> 16:13.803
Before becoming mossad in '98.

16:13.870 --> 16:15.571
Oh, wow. - What?

16:15.639 --> 16:16.939
You said this guy
tried to kill you?

16:17.007 --> 16:19.308
Yeah, with a piano wire. Why?

16:19.376 --> 16:22.278
This guy was with
kidon for five years.

16:22.345 --> 16:25.081
"the hard squad"-- assassinations,
kidnappings.

16:25.148 --> 16:27.416
This brush pass seems way
beneath his pay grade.

16:27.484 --> 16:29.351
And yet it's not beneath mine?

16:29.419 --> 16:30.653
I don't see anything in his file.

16:30.721 --> 16:32.288
Maybe he's a burn-out
case or a drinker.

16:32.355 --> 16:34.757
Yeah, or maybe he just
pissed somebody off somewhere.

16:34.825 --> 16:36.959
He's the kind of guy that
likes to piss people off.

16:37.027 --> 16:38.728
"a mossad man and his package"--

16:38.795 --> 16:41.230
Have you ever heard everything
so ridic-- whoa, my god.

16:41.298 --> 16:42.732
What?

16:42.799 --> 16:44.934
Uh, nothing.

16:45.001 --> 16:47.470
Just tell me you're working
on getting me home.

16:47.537 --> 16:49.905
I'm working on bringing you home.

16:49.973 --> 16:52.541
Is-- is it possible that
this guy's a double agent?

16:52.609 --> 16:54.710
I mean, are we even
sure he was my contact

16:54.778 --> 16:56.078
In the first place?

16:56.146 --> 16:57.246
Well, you can send me his picture

16:57.314 --> 16:58.681
And I can try to match up his I.D.

16:58.749 --> 17:00.783
I could send you a picture,

17:00.851 --> 17:05.154
But, uh, not sure it'll
work for I.D. Purposes.

17:05.222 --> 17:06.222
All right, listen,
they want to know

17:06.289 --> 17:07.522
Where you dropped the briefcase.

17:07.590 --> 17:08.624
We're gonna send someone
to go pick it up.

17:08.692 --> 17:10.126
I can still complete the mission.

17:10.193 --> 17:12.328
I mean, I can't stand this guy,
but I can still make the pass.

17:12.395 --> 17:14.663
Annie, this is not
a reflection on you.

17:14.731 --> 17:16.632
This is standard
operating procedure.

17:16.700 --> 17:20.402
Of course. Okay.
Oh, my g-- what are you doing?

17:20.470 --> 17:22.905
Annie? Annie?

17:22.973 --> 17:24.573
You know how easy to trace
one of these things are?

17:24.641 --> 17:26.075
I was talking to langley.

17:26.143 --> 17:27.309
Yeah, let me guess, cia protocol?

17:27.377 --> 17:29.111
It's an encrypted phone.

17:29.179 --> 17:30.513
What?

17:30.580 --> 17:33.048
Someone knew every nut
and bolt of our mission.

17:33.116 --> 17:35.117
So either your agency or
mine has been corrupted.

17:35.185 --> 17:36.552
My guess is it's yours,

17:36.620 --> 17:39.688
But, hey, I don't mind
admitting I'm biased.

17:39.756 --> 17:41.524
You really enjoy being
a jerk, don't you?

17:41.591 --> 17:43.025
I do.

17:43.093 --> 17:47.062
Oh, and by the way,
if you're looking for this...

17:47.130 --> 17:49.131
You're welcome to join me.

17:49.199 --> 17:52.568
Whoa.

17:56.072 --> 17:58.841
Yeah, I need a reverse cell
lookup on walker's phone.

17:58.909 --> 18:02.845
All right, you four,
report to polygraph.

18:02.913 --> 18:04.346
No, I've got the
last known location.

18:04.414 --> 18:06.248
I just need to know
if it starts moving.

18:06.316 --> 18:07.917
Let's go, anderson. Step to.

18:07.984 --> 18:09.685
I'm sorry.
This is gonna have to wait.

18:09.753 --> 18:12.021
Now.

18:12.088 --> 18:14.023
Walk this up to dcs
with the other background

18:14.090 --> 18:15.791
You're compiling as soon
as humanly possible.

18:15.859 --> 18:17.726
- Done.
- Joan.

18:17.794 --> 18:19.428
Will you call off
arthur's attack dog?

18:19.496 --> 18:21.130
I'm trying to reestablish
contact with annie.

18:21.198 --> 18:22.264
Leave the intel with me.

18:22.332 --> 18:23.766
We'll make sure
someone fills the gap.

18:23.834 --> 18:26.035
- I don't understand.
- It's a company-wide directive.

18:26.102 --> 18:27.837
Everyone's coming under scrutiny.

18:27.904 --> 18:29.238
You ready, yet, hot shot?

18:37.981 --> 18:41.283
don't be a baby.

18:41.351 --> 18:43.219
Ow.

18:43.286 --> 18:45.421
Ah.

18:45.488 --> 18:48.557
Oh!

18:48.625 --> 18:51.093
<i>- Neshama!
- What?</i>

18:51.161 --> 18:53.429
Come quick. It's an emergency.

18:53.496 --> 18:55.898
What is so pressing
that it can't w--

18:55.966 --> 18:58.834
Your food. You don't
want it to get cold.

18:58.902 --> 19:00.536
Smells good.

19:00.604 --> 19:02.471
If there's something I've
learned over the years,

19:02.539 --> 19:04.139
It's treat every meal as
though it's your last.

19:04.207 --> 19:06.642
Come on, sit down. Eat.

19:10.413 --> 19:11.847
What is it?

19:11.915 --> 19:14.283
Just a little hanger steak
with some charred eggplant

19:14.351 --> 19:16.485
And pine nuts.

19:16.553 --> 19:18.220
Oh, and a little beurre rouge.

19:27.964 --> 19:29.965
We're okay?

19:30.033 --> 19:32.334
How did you-- when did you, uh...

19:32.402 --> 19:34.603
I stowed away on a
food-service truck

19:34.671 --> 19:37.473
Getting out of the airport.

19:40.610 --> 19:42.311
What is it?

19:42.379 --> 19:44.914
Um, I don't know.
It must've been from the shrapnel.

19:44.981 --> 19:45.814
- Let me see.
- Ay.

19:45.882 --> 19:48.550
Come on, don't be shy.

19:52.489 --> 19:56.926
I'm gonna have to stitch that.
You keep eating.

20:01.231 --> 20:03.132
- I got this.
- That's okay.

20:03.199 --> 20:05.501
I'll get this. I insist.

20:05.568 --> 20:07.069
If you take his money,
someone will be listening in

20:07.137 --> 20:08.804
On every phone
conversation you have

20:08.872 --> 20:10.172
For the rest of your life.

20:10.240 --> 20:11.607
Don't listen to her.

20:11.675 --> 20:12.708
She doesn't have the power
to make that happen.

20:12.776 --> 20:15.844
I, on the other hand, do.

20:15.912 --> 20:19.848
He's the dcs.

20:19.916 --> 20:21.884
We need to talk.

20:21.952 --> 20:23.485
I'm gonna forgive you for
the price of a double latte?

20:23.553 --> 20:24.987
Is that what you think?

20:25.055 --> 20:26.855
Thank god you're not out in
the field handling assets.

20:26.923 --> 20:28.357
You don't have a feel for it.

20:28.425 --> 20:29.825
I think you're being
overly sensitive.

20:29.893 --> 20:32.061
You hung me out to dry, arthur,

20:32.128 --> 20:33.829
To save face with your foursome.

20:33.897 --> 20:35.030
Heaven forbid I'm
actually kept in the loop

20:35.098 --> 20:36.498
On any of this stuff.

20:36.566 --> 20:38.500
I still don't even know what's
in those damn briefcases.

20:38.568 --> 20:43.172
- It's just protocol.
- It's just wrong!

20:43.239 --> 20:44.673
Am I failing you as head of d.P.D.?

20:44.741 --> 20:45.874
No, of course not.

20:45.942 --> 20:48.110
If I cut you any slack
running do this leak,

20:48.178 --> 20:50.279
My wife, they'd burn the
both of us out of here.

20:50.347 --> 20:51.780
I'm gonna tell you something--

20:51.848 --> 20:54.550
David, ken, and bill are brutuses,

20:54.617 --> 20:55.784
Every single one of them.

20:55.852 --> 20:57.019
They're just waiting for the chance

20:57.087 --> 20:58.153
To stab you in the back.

20:58.221 --> 20:59.955
- Oh, come on.
- It's not their fault.

21:00.023 --> 21:03.092
It's how they were trained.
It's how we were all trained.

21:03.159 --> 21:04.994
But there is exactly one
person in this place

21:05.061 --> 21:07.162
Who you can truly
trust to the core,

21:07.230 --> 21:09.131
And you are doing your
best to alienate her.

21:13.236 --> 21:14.770
Aah!

21:14.838 --> 21:16.572
Mm. Is that gonna scar?

21:16.639 --> 21:19.908
Oh, most definitely.
But in a cute way.

21:19.976 --> 21:21.543
Right.

21:21.611 --> 21:23.545
You can always put a tattoo
over it if you don't like it.

21:23.613 --> 21:25.314
You're not jewish, are you? - No.

21:25.382 --> 21:27.016
Good. Well, good for the tattoo,

21:27.083 --> 21:31.653
Not so good for me going
to introduce you to my mom.

21:31.721 --> 21:33.622
Were you read in on
what's inside the briefcase?

21:33.690 --> 21:35.124
No.

21:35.191 --> 21:36.458
It doesn't make you curious

21:36.526 --> 21:38.127
What someone tried to kill us over?

21:38.194 --> 21:40.029
It's not for me to speculate.

21:40.096 --> 21:41.930
I can't stop thinking about it

21:41.998 --> 21:43.265
Since I boarded the plane.

21:43.333 --> 21:44.633
I don't know how you
can be so zen about it.

21:44.701 --> 21:46.068
Give you two scenarios.

21:46.136 --> 21:48.103
One, you're carrying a krytron tube

21:48.171 --> 21:49.972
Capable of triggering
a nuclear device.

21:50.040 --> 21:52.608
The second, you're just a
bagman shuffling shekels

21:52.675 --> 21:53.642
Back and forth.

21:53.710 --> 21:55.044
You having that knowledge,

21:55.111 --> 21:56.412
Is that gonna change how
you conduct yourself?

21:56.479 --> 21:57.679
Honestly?

21:57.747 --> 22:00.382
Yeah, I'm gonna conduct
myself differently.

22:00.450 --> 22:01.984
That's why they don't tell us.

22:02.052 --> 22:03.385
Just cogs in a wheel, you and I.

22:03.453 --> 22:05.921
Keep your head,
complete your mission,

22:05.989 --> 22:09.425
Let the suits worry
about the bigger stuff.

22:12.295 --> 22:14.296
All right, we're done.

22:14.364 --> 22:16.932
Let's find you
something else to wear.

22:17.000 --> 22:21.703
I-I already looked in there.
There's nothing to wear.

22:24.707 --> 22:26.275
yeah, I saw that already.

22:26.342 --> 22:28.544
Yeah?

22:28.611 --> 22:31.780
What, you weren't gonna tell me?

22:31.848 --> 22:33.449
Black leather and polaroids--

22:33.516 --> 22:35.150
Still the best way
to flip a politician.

22:35.218 --> 22:36.718
I thought it was
something like that.

22:36.786 --> 22:39.188
That's a lot of
rope for one person.

22:39.255 --> 22:41.790
Well, how do you
know it's just for one?

22:41.858 --> 22:43.592
Last time I holed
up at a safe house,

22:43.660 --> 22:45.928
All we had to play with was,
uh, scrabble.

22:45.995 --> 22:49.431
I'm fine with scrabble.

22:51.367 --> 22:54.336
So...

22:54.404 --> 22:56.205
You gonna tell me where you
dropped the package, huh?

22:56.272 --> 22:59.575
The terminal, or did you
leave it with the turk?

22:59.642 --> 23:01.877
Who's the turk?

23:01.945 --> 23:03.112
So you're gonna play it that way?

23:05.949 --> 23:08.283
What's the matter?
That guy down there...

23:08.351 --> 23:10.719
In the overalls with
the power company van.

23:10.787 --> 23:13.055
- It's Sunday.
- And those aren't work boots.

23:15.692 --> 23:17.859
Get dressed quickly.

23:52.038 --> 23:53.839
You learn this on the farm?

23:53.907 --> 23:55.674
Bouldering at moab.

23:55.742 --> 23:58.177
Oh, shoot. - Whoa. You all right?

23:58.244 --> 24:00.646
- Yeah.
- All right, ladies first.

24:00.713 --> 24:03.448
- Do you want me to, uh--
- no. I got this.

24:54.217 --> 24:55.750
I'm going to ask you
a series of questions

24:55.818 --> 24:57.986
To act as a control sample, okay?

24:58.054 --> 25:00.689
No, it's not okay.

25:00.756 --> 25:02.290
You wanted the truth, correct?

25:02.358 --> 25:03.959
Just answer the
questions, please.

25:04.026 --> 25:05.460
Your name is August anderson?

25:05.528 --> 25:07.229
Yes, but my friends
call me auggie.

25:07.296 --> 25:09.464
You can call me August.
"yes" or "no," please.

25:09.532 --> 25:11.666
You were born in glencoe, illinois.

25:11.734 --> 25:13.301
Is that correct? - Yes.

25:13.369 --> 25:14.769
Okay, you lost your eyesight

25:14.837 --> 25:16.238
While with special forces in iraq.

25:16.305 --> 25:17.706
Is that correct?

25:17.773 --> 25:20.542
I'm sorry. You'll have
to be more specific.

25:20.610 --> 25:23.144
- You were in tikrit?
- Yes.

25:23.212 --> 25:25.146
There was an incident,
an explosion.

25:25.214 --> 25:26.848
- Yes.
- And now you're blind.

25:26.916 --> 25:30.785
- No, I'm not.
- You're not?

25:30.853 --> 25:33.655
What does the machine say?

25:33.723 --> 25:35.757
I spent 12 months down on the farm,

25:35.825 --> 25:37.659
I did my sere training
at fort bragg,

25:37.727 --> 25:40.595
And I have four
mean-ass older brothers.

25:40.663 --> 25:42.197
You don't think I know
how to lie well enough

25:42.265 --> 25:45.800
To beat that thing?

25:45.868 --> 25:47.369
Are you happy with
your current position

25:47.436 --> 25:48.503
As field-ops support?

25:48.571 --> 25:51.606
Yes.

25:51.674 --> 25:53.775
Have you requested more
field responsibilities?

25:53.843 --> 25:55.410
- Once or twice.
- "yes" or "no."

25:55.478 --> 25:56.912
Yes.

25:56.979 --> 25:58.346
Are you frustrated with
your superior's decision

25:58.414 --> 25:59.848
To keep you on the bench?

25:59.916 --> 26:01.516
Well, yes, but I think
that's understandable.

26:01.584 --> 26:03.151
Do you think you know
better than management?

26:07.056 --> 26:08.323
No.

26:11.594 --> 26:12.894
Good.

26:12.962 --> 26:14.529
Now that we've
determined a baseline,

26:14.597 --> 26:17.332
We can get started.

26:22.204 --> 26:23.905
Fatma?

26:39.822 --> 26:42.424
Boy, am I glad to see you.

26:42.491 --> 26:44.893
Oh, you're here.

26:48.331 --> 26:50.265
- What the hell?
- What are you doing here?

26:50.333 --> 26:52.200
I'm here to rendezvous with you.
What do you think?

26:52.268 --> 26:55.303
Get these handcuffs off me.

26:55.371 --> 26:58.540
She was dead when I
got here, I swear.

26:58.608 --> 26:59.808
It just occurred to me

26:59.875 --> 27:03.111
In the airport, before
the flash-bangs went off,

27:03.179 --> 27:04.913
You put your sunglasses on...

27:04.981 --> 27:06.815
Like you knew what was coming.

27:06.882 --> 27:10.185
Well, you-- you're completely
paranoid, aren't you?

27:10.252 --> 27:12.821
Listen, check the body if you
don't believe me, l right?

27:12.888 --> 27:14.856
Rigor has set in all the
way through the torso.

27:14.924 --> 27:16.625
She's been dead for
four hours at least.

27:25.968 --> 27:28.470
Chesapeake bay letter press.
How can I help you?

27:28.537 --> 27:30.739
Offset litho and
proof desk, please.

27:30.806 --> 27:33.174
Hello, helvetica.
It's good to have you back.

27:33.242 --> 27:34.109
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

27:34.176 --> 27:35.210
I- I-I need to speak

27:35.277 --> 27:37.045
With my normal service
representative.

27:37.113 --> 27:38.780
Officer anderson's
currently unavailable.

27:38.848 --> 27:40.715
I'm gonna be your
acting liaison now.

27:40.783 --> 27:42.450
My name's braithwaite,
eric braithwaite.

27:42.518 --> 27:44.119
Acting liaison?
I don't understand.

27:44.186 --> 27:45.620
Hang up the phone, annie.

27:45.688 --> 27:48.323
- Y-you're not d.P.D.?
- I'm ncs.

27:48.391 --> 27:49.791
We're gonna be handling
your extraction.

27:49.859 --> 27:52.494
Changing liaisons mid-mission
with no handover?

27:52.561 --> 27:53.795
I need your 20.

27:53.863 --> 27:55.630
Hey, we can't rely
on normal channels.

27:55.698 --> 27:58.400
We must assume everything's
been compromised.

27:58.467 --> 27:59.801
Helvetica, I want to remind you

27:59.869 --> 28:03.271
To please just follow protocol.

28:03.339 --> 28:05.407
Just give me one good
reason to trust you right now.

28:05.474 --> 28:07.876
Doesn't matter if you
can trust me or not.

28:07.943 --> 28:10.412
The question is, can you use
me to complete your mission?

28:10.479 --> 28:12.080
That's all that's important.

28:12.148 --> 28:13.715
And it's gonna be really difficult

28:13.783 --> 28:16.217
For you to leave the
country without this.

28:16.285 --> 28:18.086
Listen, we retrieve your package.

28:18.154 --> 28:20.755
We make the exchange,
and this is yours.

28:20.823 --> 28:25.427
I found some fresh
clothes in the back.

28:25.494 --> 28:28.029
Come on, annie... Use me.

28:28.097 --> 28:29.831
Helvetica?

28:34.804 --> 28:37.706
I'll call back in when I can.

28:50.553 --> 28:51.753
Don't make me regret this.

28:59.962 --> 29:01.629
Let's go.

29:06.021 --> 29:07.689
Do you believe in the
concept of a greater good?

29:07.757 --> 29:09.090
Yes, I suppose.

29:09.158 --> 29:11.059
And you believe
yourself qualified

29:11.127 --> 29:12.660
To be the arbiter of that?

29:12.728 --> 29:14.796
- What are you getting at?
- Let me rephrase.

29:14.864 --> 29:17.499
Do you think that
there's a part of you

29:17.566 --> 29:20.769
That wants to punish the agency
for what happened to you?

29:20.836 --> 29:23.805
I don't believe this.

29:23.873 --> 29:26.708
There is an operative out
there somewhere in the cold,

29:26.776 --> 29:28.743
Alone, and in danger.

29:28.811 --> 29:30.612
And every second I am spending here

29:30.679 --> 29:32.680
Twaddling with you is a
second I am not helping her

29:32.748 --> 29:33.748
To get back home.

29:33.816 --> 29:35.917
So let's cut the psychobabble

29:35.985 --> 29:37.752
And just ask me the
question you want to know.

29:37.820 --> 29:39.254
Did I corrupt the
zurich exchange? No.

29:39.321 --> 29:40.789
That's not what I want to know.

29:40.856 --> 29:42.056
It's not?

29:42.124 --> 29:43.458
Are you the source
in the liza hearn leak?

29:43.526 --> 29:44.759
What?

29:44.827 --> 29:47.295
Are you liza hearn's source?

29:52.134 --> 29:53.902
No.

29:56.305 --> 29:59.507
Are we done now?

30:09.185 --> 30:12.187
Ah, the old "hidden
in plain sight" gambit.

30:12.254 --> 30:14.722
It works well until the manager
sees something out of place.

30:14.790 --> 30:16.124
And trust me, retail managers,

30:16.192 --> 30:17.425
They always notice when
things are out of place,

30:17.493 --> 30:18.526
No matter how small.

30:18.594 --> 30:20.728
You want to recruit a spy,

30:20.796 --> 30:22.163
Forget about the army
or your ivy league.

30:22.231 --> 30:23.798
Just set up outside
a good benetton.

30:23.866 --> 30:26.434
It's not in the luggage store.

30:29.138 --> 30:30.638
Then where?

30:30.706 --> 30:32.841
The linen closet, the ice machine?

30:32.908 --> 30:34.442
You're not instilling me
with a lot of confidence.

30:34.510 --> 30:35.710
I know what I'm doing.

30:35.778 --> 30:39.447
A slow Sunday afternoon
in a half-booked hotel.

30:57.600 --> 31:01.236
Don't tell me.

31:01.303 --> 31:03.004
Yeah.

31:03.072 --> 31:04.873
It's under the bride.

31:20.689 --> 31:23.491
- What's this?
- That's all we know re: Zurich.

31:23.559 --> 31:25.493
The operation was compromised
on the israeli side.

31:25.561 --> 31:27.161
They believe one of their
operatives went rogue--

31:27.229 --> 31:28.863
This guy, daniel klein.
You know him?

31:28.931 --> 31:30.298
No.

31:30.366 --> 31:31.699
I'm trying to negotiate
sanctuary for walker,

31:31.767 --> 31:33.801
But the swiss are in no
mood to do us any favors

31:33.869 --> 31:37.138
Since we forced their
hand on bank secrecy.

31:37.206 --> 31:39.540
You're reading me in on this.

31:39.608 --> 31:40.942
Excuse me, mr. Campbell?

31:41.010 --> 31:44.545
I was told to tell you they
need you back upstairs.

31:47.783 --> 31:49.617
Dinner later, maybe?

31:49.685 --> 31:50.818
If I can?

31:50.886 --> 31:53.121
Sure. Just let me know.

32:02.164 --> 32:10.271
* *

32:10.339 --> 32:11.539
Unbelievable.

32:11.607 --> 32:12.907
You found the one hotel in zurich

32:12.975 --> 32:14.709
Without a working fire alarm.

32:14.777 --> 32:17.278
they can't sit there all night.

32:17.346 --> 32:21.015
They have to get up
and dance sometime.

32:21.083 --> 32:22.583
Let's just topple the table.

32:22.651 --> 32:25.086
Hey, hey.

32:25.154 --> 32:27.989
See that crew cut
leaning on the post?

32:28.057 --> 32:31.159
- Yeah.
- Canton police sergeant...

32:31.226 --> 32:33.761
Off-duty-- that's
their regiment tie.

32:33.829 --> 32:36.597
I don't know how long we
have before someone makes us.

32:40.135 --> 32:43.738
We should dance, don't you think?

32:43.806 --> 32:46.874
To blend in.

32:46.942 --> 32:50.678
* *

32:50.746 --> 32:52.146
In case anyone asks,

32:52.214 --> 32:54.849
You're cousin heidi's
son from liechtenstein.

32:57.219 --> 32:59.320
You're pretty good at this,
you know?

32:59.388 --> 33:01.990
I used to dance
competitively as a boy.

33:02.057 --> 33:04.325
Get out of here.
Why did you quit?

33:04.393 --> 33:05.893
Well, it was all rigged.

33:05.961 --> 33:07.528
When I stopped kissing
the ring, pfft,

33:07.596 --> 33:09.630
Judges go east german on you.

33:09.698 --> 33:11.699
And you don't like to
kiss the ring, do you?

33:11.767 --> 33:13.301
Is that why they
sent you on a mission

33:13.369 --> 33:16.437
They normally have a rookie run?

33:16.505 --> 33:18.339
<i>Another lesson I've learned,
neshama--</i>

33:18.407 --> 33:22.210
Don't pretend to know something
you have no clue about.

33:22.277 --> 33:23.745
I was just curious.

33:27.216 --> 33:29.283
I'm gonna ask her to dance.

33:29.351 --> 33:31.719
Get ready to grab
the package. - Okay.

33:31.787 --> 33:35.990
Just, uh, try not to be yourself.

33:36.058 --> 33:43.031
* *

34:10.993 --> 34:13.561
* you didn't heed my advice *

34:13.629 --> 34:15.596
- She's injured.
- Oh.

34:15.664 --> 34:17.398
Looks like a walking cast to me.

34:17.466 --> 34:19.699
If she really wanted to,
she could've, uh...

34:19.768 --> 34:21.969
Well, you can't account
for some women's taste.

34:22.036 --> 34:23.670
I mean, look at the
guy she just married.

34:23.739 --> 34:24.938
Can you imagine a
lifetime with that?

34:28.510 --> 34:31.145
She's getting
frustrated with him.

34:31.213 --> 34:33.347
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

34:33.415 --> 34:35.382
Get ready to grab the package.

34:40.389 --> 34:41.822
- Hey-hey!
- Ha!

35:15.090 --> 35:17.758
* it's you, it's me *

35:17.826 --> 35:21.496
* mysteries are coming clear *

35:21.563 --> 35:24.799
* once your heart is true *

35:24.867 --> 35:27.902
* all your troubles disappear *

35:39.248 --> 35:41.516
You...

35:48.490 --> 35:50.358
I wasn't sure you were coming back.

35:55.664 --> 35:59.534
You want to know
why I was sent here?

35:59.601 --> 36:03.070
It's because I missed a ferry.

36:03.138 --> 36:05.473
I was escorting an
asset off of corfu--

36:05.541 --> 36:07.408
A ferry to athens,
then a flight to tel aviv.

36:07.476 --> 36:09.510
Sounds easy, right?

36:09.578 --> 36:11.512
Except the guy's in the
middle of this custody thing

36:11.580 --> 36:13.181
With his wife.

36:13.248 --> 36:15.416
Didn't get a chance to say
good-bye to his little girl.

36:15.484 --> 36:18.452
And where we're going,
he might never get that chance.

36:18.520 --> 36:21.022
That's another thing you
learn in our business--

36:21.089 --> 36:22.890
Make every good-bye count.

36:24.760 --> 36:27.328
Anyway, we,
uh-- we missed the ferry.

36:27.396 --> 36:28.763
We caught the one the next day.

36:28.830 --> 36:31.566
They benched you for that?

36:31.633 --> 36:33.968
I didn't follow protocol.

36:34.036 --> 36:35.836
That's what I get for
being such a nice gui.

36:39.508 --> 36:42.009
So where to now?
We'll head to bern.

36:42.077 --> 36:43.611
I know another safe house there,

36:43.679 --> 36:46.547
Then maybe a train
to France or Italy.

36:46.615 --> 36:48.783
The riviera?

36:48.850 --> 36:51.552
Spend some time on the beach.

37:03.022 --> 37:05.691
Eyal!

37:05.758 --> 37:07.192
Eyal!

37:07.260 --> 37:08.794
You're gonna have to start

37:08.862 --> 37:10.462
Pulling your weight
in this partnership.

37:10.530 --> 37:11.430
You know, it's only fair.

37:28.281 --> 37:32.851
I'm gonna need you to find
us a quick way out of here.

38:00.914 --> 38:02.547
You've had that this whole time,

38:02.615 --> 38:03.849
And you're just using it now?

38:03.917 --> 38:05.183
Wouldn't have done
any good earlier.

38:05.251 --> 38:06.285
It's the first time I
had a clear advantage.

38:08.154 --> 38:09.755
Langley doesn't issue you these?

38:09.822 --> 38:11.123
No, they don't.

38:11.190 --> 38:12.291
I guess that makes
you the only americans

38:12.358 --> 38:14.860
Who don't carry guns, huh?

38:26.372 --> 38:27.940
I take it you are
walker and lavin.

38:28.007 --> 38:30.776
We've just received
word from interpol.

38:30.843 --> 38:32.210
Seems you two have
some planes to catch.

38:39.986 --> 38:43.722
- Auggie, good news-
- you passed your polygraph.

38:43.790 --> 38:45.657
You'll be back on your
desk tomorrow morning.

38:45.725 --> 38:47.893
Imagine that.

38:47.961 --> 38:49.594
See you tomorrow.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.501
So when did you
make them for mossad?

38:56.569 --> 38:59.972
It was the way they
entered the safe house...

39:00.039 --> 39:01.773
In teams, always four, always--

39:01.841 --> 39:04.543
One for transport,
one to locate the target,

39:04.610 --> 39:07.079
And two for the execution.

39:07.146 --> 39:08.347
I think you owe
langley an apology.

39:08.414 --> 39:09.748
Yeah, I know.

39:09.816 --> 39:11.116
Plus, I'm horribly embarrassed
by their inability

39:11.184 --> 39:12.551
To take us out.

39:12.618 --> 39:14.019
I mean, it's a national
disgrace the fact that you and I

39:14.087 --> 39:15.687
Are still walking-- especially you.

39:15.755 --> 39:18.223
So hold on. You let me
believe it was langley

39:18.291 --> 39:20.659
Even after you knew it wasn't?

39:20.727 --> 39:23.395
Like I said, anything
to complete the mission.

39:23.463 --> 39:26.965
Just cogs in the wheel, right?

39:27.033 --> 39:29.468
So do you think we
should finally do this?

39:32.972 --> 39:35.340
Wait, how do we
know which is which?

39:37.910 --> 39:39.311
Powerpuff girl?

39:39.379 --> 39:41.880
My niece gave it to me for luck.

39:41.948 --> 39:44.416
Never put it this much
to the test before.

39:47.220 --> 39:49.821
Maybe the riviera next time.

39:49.889 --> 39:51.289
I don't know.

39:51.357 --> 39:53.692
The beaches in israel
are much better.

39:53.760 --> 39:56.194
<i>- Really?
- Didn't you hear, neshama?</i>

39:56.262 --> 39:58.163
Everything's better in israel.

40:13.513 --> 40:15.213
Are you awake?

40:15.281 --> 40:17.816
Now I am.

40:17.884 --> 40:19.885
Can I ask you something?

40:19.952 --> 40:23.622
When you read me in earlier
on the zurich situation,

40:23.689 --> 40:27.225
Did you do that as my
boss or as my husband?

40:27.293 --> 40:29.361
Honestly, I don't know.

40:29.429 --> 40:32.230
Is there a right answer
to that question?

40:35.101 --> 40:37.636
I don't know either.

40:52.819 --> 40:54.653
Did you check any luggage,
ms. Abramowitz?

40:54.720 --> 40:57.789
Nope, just the
one carry-on today.

40:57.857 --> 41:00.525
Cab fare just in case.

41:03.062 --> 41:05.580
Nice work, helvetica.

41:27.887 --> 41:30.555
