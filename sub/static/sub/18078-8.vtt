00:02.298 --> 00:03.925
Racing's a man's game.

00:03.999 --> 00:05.364
Can't you win
in a fair race?

00:05.434 --> 00:06.492
[groaning]

00:07.136 --> 00:09.036
Hi, Kid.
lt's nice to see you,
Uncle John.

00:09.204 --> 00:10.899
l mean,
that Kyle Ludwig is crazy.

00:10.973 --> 00:12.338
He almost killed
Dana and the baby...

00:12.408 --> 00:14.205
trashed my car
and put me in here.

00:15.344 --> 00:17.039
That ought to get
his engine started.

00:17.112 --> 00:19.046
Looks like Decker's got
a surprise party for us.

00:19.114 --> 00:20.843
(Murdock)
So if you're looking
for the A-Team...

00:20.916 --> 00:21.883
you're out of luck.

00:21.951 --> 00:22.975
You're dead.

00:24.553 --> 00:26.714
The only place you're going
is to prison, Smith.

00:26.789 --> 00:28.416
How are you today?

00:28.724 --> 00:30.055
(Decker)
There they go!

00:30.359 --> 00:31.951
Get ready for
the main event.

00:34.029 --> 00:36.327
(male narrator)
In 1972,
a crack commando unit....

00:36.398 --> 00:38.298
was sent to prison
by a military court....

00:38.367 --> 00:39.698
for a crime
they didn't commit.

00:39.768 --> 00:41.030
These men promptly escaped...

00:41.136 --> 00:42.660
from a maximum-security
stockade....

00:42.738 --> 00:44.296
to the Los Angeles
underground.

00:44.406 --> 00:46.033
Today, still wanted
by the government....

00:46.108 --> 00:48.076
they survive
as soldiers of fortune.

00:48.143 --> 00:50.703
If you have a problem,
if no one else can help...

00:50.779 --> 00:52.007
and if you can find them...

00:52.081 --> 00:54.015
maybe you can hire
the A-Team.

00:54.116 --> 00:55.811
[gun firing]

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

02:17.533 --> 02:18.864
(Jack)
l think it's okay, honey...

02:18.934 --> 02:21.061
if you give it
a little gas along here.

02:21.537 --> 02:23.437
That way
we'll make up some time.

02:23.939 --> 02:26.430
You sound just like
your son, you know that?

02:26.508 --> 02:29.136
That's all you two
think about,
is driving faster.

02:29.812 --> 02:33.976
l promised my boy l'd get you
to the doctor's appointment
on time, didn't l?

02:34.049 --> 02:37.450
l mean, he must've made me
promise at least
a half a dozen times.

02:37.519 --> 02:40.283
l swear, l don't know
who's more nervous
about having this baby...

02:40.355 --> 02:41.344
him or me.

02:41.423 --> 02:42.856
Besides, it only
an appointment.

02:42.925 --> 02:45.155
l'll probably have to sit
in the waiting room anyway.

02:46.095 --> 02:48.359
And l won't tell him
that you overslept.

02:48.430 --> 02:50.694
Honey, you are
the greatest.

02:52.701 --> 02:54.692
Well, look at that.

02:55.037 --> 02:57.631
Jack Harmon must be
going someplace
in a real hurry.

02:57.773 --> 02:58.865
He ought to be
more careful.

02:58.941 --> 03:00.932
He could have
a real bad accident
driving that fast.

03:01.610 --> 03:03.305
[tires squealing]

03:06.815 --> 03:09.079
You know sometimes
l just can't believe it...

03:09.151 --> 03:11.779
that you and the Kid
are gonna have a baby.

03:12.488 --> 03:14.615
And l'm gonna have me
a grandson.

03:14.690 --> 03:15.884
Or a granddaughter.

03:15.958 --> 03:19.416
Maybe we'll hit the jackpot
and we'll have one of each.

03:20.195 --> 03:21.492
[Jack chuckling]

04:06.575 --> 04:08.440
Don't you think
you've had enough
to drink?

04:08.777 --> 04:10.802
They ran us
off the road, son.

04:10.879 --> 04:12.403
There wasn't anything
l could do.

04:12.481 --> 04:14.176
Oh, man, you should've
done something.

04:14.249 --> 04:15.580
You were supposed
to be driving.

04:15.651 --> 04:16.913
That's what
you were there for.

04:16.985 --> 04:19.351
You know, if you'd
just called Uncle John
in the first place...

04:19.421 --> 04:20.786
this whole thing
never would have happened.

04:20.856 --> 04:23.017
Uncle John. Don't tell me
about Uncle John.

04:23.292 --> 04:26.261
He's no better than
Kyle Ludwig and the rest
of his goons.

04:26.395 --> 04:28.920
l'm sure not
gonna be forced out
of this championship.

04:28.997 --> 04:31.465
Maybe it's time somebody
did something about it.

04:31.967 --> 04:33.832
Hey, Kid! Kid, don't!

04:34.770 --> 04:35.862
Kid!

04:47.950 --> 04:48.974
Ludwig!

04:49.051 --> 04:50.450
l wanna talk
to you, now!

04:51.820 --> 04:54.846
Well, if it's not
the famous Kid Harmon.

04:55.424 --> 04:57.051
How you doing, Kid?

04:57.125 --> 04:58.490
Oh, how's the family, huh?

04:59.995 --> 05:02.020
You're all through
harassing me and my wife.

05:02.097 --> 05:03.223
No kidding.

05:03.298 --> 05:04.856
Yeah, no kidding, man.

05:06.134 --> 05:10.662
You listen to me.
You see, racing....
Racing's a man's game.

05:11.039 --> 05:14.167
And one of these days,
when you grow up,
maybe you'll qualify, huh?

05:14.276 --> 05:15.607
[groaning]

05:17.579 --> 05:18.671
[panting]
Listen, man.

05:18.747 --> 05:21.147
Nothing's gonna make me
drop out of the championship.

05:21.216 --> 05:22.342
Nothing, Ludwig.

05:22.417 --> 05:26.478
You know, l ask myself,
l say, how come this kid
is such a slow learner, huh?

05:26.855 --> 05:29.221
l mean, how come
all the other drivers
on this track...

05:29.291 --> 05:31.759
understand that l'm gonna
win the title, not you?

05:31.827 --> 05:33.226
No, not you.

05:33.795 --> 05:36.229
l mean, even your own pit crew
got the hint.

05:36.298 --> 05:37.822
They took off
early this morning.

05:37.899 --> 05:39.560
Can't you win
in a fair race?

05:40.669 --> 05:45.299
Well, let's just say
that l truly hate losers...

05:45.974 --> 05:48.101
and these boys here,
they're gonna show you...

05:48.176 --> 05:50.167
the kind of loser
you really are.

05:55.350 --> 05:58.842
Oops. Looks like you got
car trouble, Kid, huh?

06:01.657 --> 06:02.783
[groaning]

06:06.228 --> 06:07.991
You take Kid Harmon...

06:08.730 --> 06:11.221
and you take him
out of the lineup
permanently.

06:13.268 --> 06:15.259
You'll have to leave soon.
We need the room.

06:15.337 --> 06:16.827
l'll prepare
the discharge papers.

06:16.905 --> 06:17.929
Hi, Kid.

06:18.006 --> 06:19.701
Uncle John,
what are you doing here?

06:19.775 --> 06:22.403
So good to see you,
Uncle John.
Thank you for coming.

06:22.477 --> 06:25.446
Well, sure. l was here
for the Boy Scout jamboree,
wasn't l?

06:25.514 --> 06:26.811
This is no jamboree
this time.

06:27.049 --> 06:29.517
Yeah, we know.
Dana told us all about it
when she called.

06:29.584 --> 06:31.211
You shouldn't have
done that, Dana.

06:31.286 --> 06:33.049
There's nothing anybody
can do for me.

06:33.121 --> 06:34.520
Kyle Ludwig
has seen to that.

06:34.589 --> 06:37.387
l remember when the military
thought they could keep us
from your wedding.

06:37.459 --> 06:39.154
And a lovely wedding
it was, too.

06:39.227 --> 06:41.422
You know, l kept a piece
of your wedding cake...

06:41.496 --> 06:43.157
and l put in the back
of B.A.'s van...

06:43.231 --> 06:45.222
and it got all moldy
and started to spread wings.

06:45.300 --> 06:46.733
You left cake
in my van?

06:47.436 --> 06:51.634
Don't give up, honey.
Uncle John took a big risk
coming here like this.

06:51.707 --> 06:54.574
You know
how that Colonel Decker
is always snooping around.

06:54.643 --> 06:56.611
l never knew you
to be a quitter, Kid.

06:56.778 --> 06:59.713
What did you expect me to do?
l mean, that Kyle Ludwig
is crazy.

06:59.781 --> 07:01.339
He almost killed
Dana and the baby...

07:01.416 --> 07:03.350
trashed my car
and put me in here.

07:04.252 --> 07:07.016
Face, maybe you could check
on that bill with that nurse.

07:07.089 --> 07:08.078
All right.

07:08.657 --> 07:11.558
We gotta get that cake
out of my van. Come on.

07:14.329 --> 07:15.421
You know, Kid...

07:15.797 --> 07:18.265
B.A.'s got his heart set
on fixing your car.

07:18.433 --> 07:20.993
There's not a store
in the county
that'll sell him spare parts.

07:21.069 --> 07:22.468
Kyle Ludwig has seen
to that.

07:22.537 --> 07:24.664
Well, Dana said your father
was getting us parts.

07:24.740 --> 07:25.900
My father's what?

07:26.074 --> 07:27.974
He wanted to
make it up to you, honey.

07:28.043 --> 07:29.670
He felt bad
about what happened.

07:29.745 --> 07:31.372
l guess things
aren't any better
with Jack, huh?

07:31.646 --> 07:32.670
Better?

07:32.748 --> 07:34.477
His drinking's gotten
worse than ever.

07:35.050 --> 07:36.449
lf he did go for parts...

07:36.518 --> 07:38.611
he'd have to go
to some other county,
is that right?

07:38.687 --> 07:40.314
Right.
Well, where'd he go?

07:40.389 --> 07:41.856
He took 1 24 to Trenton.

07:42.224 --> 07:44.249
Check out of here,
we'll meet you
at the garage.

07:44.326 --> 07:45.315
Okay.

07:45.394 --> 07:47.328
Do you think Ludwig
would try to stop him?

07:48.029 --> 07:49.121
We'll find out.

07:50.966 --> 07:52.160
[sighs]

07:57.506 --> 08:00.907
Looks like
Mr. Ludwig was right
about old Jack Harmon.

08:01.676 --> 08:04.941
He's going for spare parts
to rebuild the Kid's car
for the race.

08:05.013 --> 08:07.538
Some insurance company
sure ain't gonna be
too happy about...

08:07.616 --> 08:09.277
all the accidents
this family's having.

08:44.986 --> 08:46.613
l think we're too late,
Colonel.

08:46.688 --> 08:48.155
Let's go get them, B.A.

08:52.761 --> 08:54.388
[tires squealing]

09:41.076 --> 09:42.270
Jack, you
all right?

09:42.577 --> 09:45.273
l was just fine
till you showed up.

09:56.625 --> 09:59.719
lt's like l told you,
Uncle John. l mean,
lt's a total loss.

10:00.295 --> 10:03.321
Kyle Ludwig is gonna be
running this race alone now.

10:03.398 --> 10:05.332
Now, this mess
is beyond fixing.

10:05.400 --> 10:07.493
Hey, Kid, if it's got
a engine in it...

10:07.569 --> 10:08.934
B.A. Baracus
can fix it.

10:09.004 --> 10:10.369
Why are you
reacting like that?

10:10.438 --> 10:12.599
Kid here, he didn't mean
no offense by what he said.

10:12.674 --> 10:16.701
He just doesn't realize
that you are a consummate
internal-combustion artist...

10:16.778 --> 10:20.612
born with a socket wrench
in one hand and 10W40
coursing through your veins.

10:20.682 --> 10:23.810
You know our B.A. here,
his first job was a lube job.

10:23.885 --> 10:25.750
lf you don't shut up
with your jibber-jabber...

10:25.820 --> 10:27.651
l'm gonna give you
a lube job, fool.

10:29.457 --> 10:32.790
Well, l checked out
Kyle Ludwig, all right...

10:32.861 --> 10:35.159
and, oh, l just want to know,
we haven't lost our knack...

10:35.230 --> 10:38.791
for putting ourselves
in the most dangerous
situations possible.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.594
Man, l told you.
Kyle Ludwig won't let
anybody get near him.

10:41.670 --> 10:43.934
Yeah, kind of makes you wonder
how a guy like that...

10:44.005 --> 10:47.168
can pay for a racecar,
pit crew...

10:47.309 --> 10:49.641
and, oh, the bodyguards
with 40-inch necks.

10:49.711 --> 10:53.704
He gets his money
the old-fashioned way.
He earns it.

10:53.815 --> 10:55.214
No, Murdock, no.

10:55.283 --> 10:58.650
l think he does
what a lot of young people
do these days.

10:58.720 --> 11:00.085
He gets money
from home.

11:00.155 --> 11:03.283
Unfortunately for us,
''home'' in this case
happens to be...

11:03.358 --> 11:06.521
a Chicago crime family
run by his dear uncle.

11:06.661 --> 11:09.824
Uncle Carl
''The Hatchet'' Ludwig.

11:10.198 --> 11:13.395
Whatever Kyle wants,
his dear Uncle Carl
gives him?

11:13.468 --> 11:14.799
l hear they're very close.

11:15.236 --> 11:16.965
l had an Uncle Carl once.

11:17.372 --> 11:18.737
He was a milkman.

11:18.807 --> 11:21.708
But l never got
anything out of him
but cottage cheese.

11:21.776 --> 11:24.404
Oh, fool, your brain's
made of cottage cheese.

11:24.479 --> 11:25.571
Honey.

11:26.648 --> 11:28.115
lt'll be all right, Dana.

11:29.517 --> 11:31.212
Uncle John will know
what to do.

11:31.353 --> 11:32.877
Murdock,
you got first watch.

11:32.954 --> 11:36.720
When Kyle finds out
what we did to his musclemen,
we won't be very popular.

11:36.791 --> 11:38.019
Hmm, no.

11:39.260 --> 11:41.820
No, if he'd just
take the time
to get to know us.

11:41.896 --> 11:44.922
Uncle John,
do you really think
Ludwig would come here...

11:45.000 --> 11:47.560
l mean, to our own garage,
in the middle of the day?

11:47.636 --> 11:49.797
Never put a stupid move
past a stupid man.

11:49.871 --> 11:51.429
lt's a rule
of survival, Dana.

11:51.506 --> 11:53.736
Here we have another
pearl of wisdom...

11:53.808 --> 11:56.504
according to the great
Saint Smith, huh?

11:56.845 --> 11:59.473
All the while l thought
you were a friend
of the family's.

11:59.547 --> 12:00.741
l can't really believe...

12:00.815 --> 12:03.249
that you're gonna put my kids
in the middle of a war.

12:03.585 --> 12:06.281
Now, we wouldn't want Ludwig
to think he won, would we?

12:06.354 --> 12:08.549
This old wreck
is not gonna run
and you know it.

12:08.623 --> 12:12.115
Hey, if you think that,
then why did you even bother
trying to get parts?

12:12.193 --> 12:13.854
Listen to me, son.

12:13.928 --> 12:15.919
He can make all the promises
he wants to...

12:15.997 --> 12:17.589
but he can't drive
the race for you.

12:17.666 --> 12:19.327
What the kid needs
is a new car.

12:19.401 --> 12:22.859
Now, there's one guy
that l know
who's got enough money...

12:22.937 --> 12:25.531
to buy that new car,
and that's Ludwig himself.

12:25.607 --> 12:29.134
But why would Kyle Ludwig
give us money for a car?

12:29.244 --> 12:31.838
Oh, l'm sure he'll be
extremely generous...

12:31.913 --> 12:33.938
if Face asks him
the right way.

12:34.582 --> 12:35.606
Yeah.

12:36.851 --> 12:38.910
(Ludwig)
How much time do you need,
anyhow, huh?

12:38.987 --> 12:40.614
l send you out to do
a simple little job...

12:40.689 --> 12:42.953
you come back here
with your tails
between your legs.

12:43.491 --> 12:46.187
Harmons must've hired
some heavy hitters,
Mr. Ludwig.

12:46.261 --> 12:48.855
Oh, is that what you want me
to tell my Uncle Carl, huh?

12:48.930 --> 12:52.366
You are supposed
to be the heavy hitters
from Chicago, remember?

12:52.434 --> 12:54.902
We'll make sure Kid Harmon
doesn't rebuild his car,
don't worry.

12:54.969 --> 12:56.459
Oh, no, l'm not
gonna worry, huh?

12:56.538 --> 12:58.438
Harmon's the only driver
on the whole circuit...

12:58.506 --> 13:00.440
that could take
the championship
away from me...

13:00.508 --> 13:02.772
and l tell you,
if he gets one wheel
on that track...

13:02.844 --> 13:06.109
my Uncle Carl's gonna know
just how unhappy l am.
You understand me?

13:06.347 --> 13:07.371
[phone ringing]

13:07.449 --> 13:09.417
Get it, on your way out.

13:09.751 --> 13:12.413
l'm gonna give these girls
a chance to relax me.

13:13.054 --> 13:14.180
l'm so tense.

13:14.956 --> 13:17.186
[phone continues ringing]

13:17.525 --> 13:18.651
Yeah?

13:19.494 --> 13:21.621
Mr. Ludwig don't wanna
see anybody right now.

13:23.898 --> 13:25.456
The Figoratti racing team?

13:25.800 --> 13:27.563
Figoratti?
What about Figoratti?

13:27.635 --> 13:30.297
Some guy outside. He says
he's supposed to have
an appointment with you.

13:30.371 --> 13:32.066
He's with the Figoratti
racing team from ltaly.

13:32.140 --> 13:34.233
l know where
the Figoratti team is.

13:34.309 --> 13:36.334
They're the best
in the world.
Send the guy in.

13:36.411 --> 13:37.503
Come in.

13:38.480 --> 13:39.538
Stupid.

13:41.816 --> 13:43.215
There you go.

13:44.319 --> 13:45.445
Here.

13:46.454 --> 13:47.443
[sighing]

13:48.323 --> 13:49.790
Here you are.

13:50.191 --> 13:51.249
Dave Pacini...

13:51.326 --> 13:53.726
Figoratti Racing
representative
for the Western Hemisphere.

13:54.796 --> 13:58.892
Let me compliment you,
Mr. Ludwig, on your
excellent staff.

13:58.967 --> 14:00.298
Your associate
in the hallway...

14:00.368 --> 14:03.565
he questioned me
most thoroughly
about why l'm here.

14:03.638 --> 14:04.866
So, why are you here?

14:04.939 --> 14:06.531
Well, it was all
in my letter. You....

14:08.309 --> 14:10.834
Oh, no. Don't tell me. You....

14:11.312 --> 14:12.870
You see, my secretary
in New York...

14:12.947 --> 14:14.938
she assured me
all the arrangements
had been made.

14:15.016 --> 14:17.712
Then l show up here.
l don't even have
hotel reservations.

14:17.786 --> 14:20.653
l should have anticipated
it was gonna be
one of these days, huh?

14:21.022 --> 14:23.354
You never got my letter,
am l right?

14:23.424 --> 14:24.652
You're right.

14:24.726 --> 14:26.159
Let me be brief.
Please.

14:26.261 --> 14:30.630
Okay. The Figoratti family,
as you well know,
has proudly financed...

14:30.698 --> 14:33.861
five racing teams
on the international
circuit...

14:33.935 --> 14:35.835
for, well,
for many years.

14:35.904 --> 14:40.603
Unfortunately, recent
mounting costs have made it
necessary for them to seek...

14:41.009 --> 14:44.672
oh, how shall we put it,
outside revenue sources.

14:44.746 --> 14:46.771
You know, everybody knows
in the racing world...

14:46.848 --> 14:49.976
this Figoratti guy's
a playboy and he's blowing
the family fortune, right?

14:50.051 --> 14:52.611
So why don't you just
cut through the grease job
here, all right?

14:52.720 --> 14:53.709
[titters]

14:54.522 --> 14:55.682
[hesitantly]
Can....

14:55.757 --> 14:57.987
Can we discuss this
in private?

14:58.393 --> 15:00.827
Oh, absolutely.
Take a hike.

15:01.529 --> 15:04.555
But the girls stay.
They know better
than to talk, don't you?

15:04.632 --> 15:05.963
[laughing]

15:06.534 --> 15:08.627
Great country, isn't it?
Certainly is.

15:10.271 --> 15:13.069
Well, let me be candid,
Mr. Ludwig.

15:13.274 --> 15:16.835
Giancarlo Figoratti
can no longer afford
the millions it takes...

15:16.911 --> 15:18.970
to keep five teams
in operation.

15:19.047 --> 15:20.071
What's in it for me?

15:20.148 --> 15:22.139
Tell me, have you ever...

15:22.217 --> 15:25.311
given any consideration
to driving international
Formula 1?

15:25.386 --> 15:26.478
Formula 1?

15:26.688 --> 15:30.283
Are you telling me
that l could buy my way onto
the Figoratti racing team?

15:31.125 --> 15:33.650
Formula 1, huh?
l mean, of course
l want to drive one.

15:33.728 --> 15:36.094
God, l'd blow
the whole field away
with a Formula 1 .

15:36.164 --> 15:37.791
Well, how much dough
are we talking about?

15:37.866 --> 15:40.926
Oh, million dollars.
Spread over the whole season.

15:41.536 --> 15:43.163
Million dollars.
Yes.

15:43.338 --> 15:47.206
Now, what makes you think
l got that kind of money, huh?

15:47.408 --> 15:50.002
Mr. Ludwig, you come
from a very wealthy...

15:50.078 --> 15:52.046
very influential family.

15:52.513 --> 15:55.607
And word has it
that there may be certain...

15:55.850 --> 15:59.877
profits that need
to be disposed of
in quiet European ventures.

15:59.954 --> 16:02.047
l'll tell you what,
l've decided to like you.

16:02.123 --> 16:03.886
You call me Kyle
from now on, all right?

16:03.958 --> 16:06.017
And l'll talk
to my Uncle Carl
about the money.

16:06.094 --> 16:07.186
Excellent.

16:07.262 --> 16:09.560
Well, l have to talk
to some other
potential investors...

16:09.631 --> 16:11.622
so what say
we connect in, oh....

16:11.699 --> 16:14.600
No, no, don't talk
about investors.
No?

16:14.669 --> 16:17.103
l'm gonna drive
your car for you,
you understand?

16:17.171 --> 16:19.969
How much are we talking
to lock this little deal up
right now?

16:20.174 --> 16:22.142
Oh, Kyle,
l'm not authorized--

16:22.210 --> 16:25.338
Oh, no, come on,
we're not gonna talk about
''authorized,'' are we, man?

16:25.413 --> 16:26.437
No.
No.

16:26.514 --> 16:29.176
Well--
What we're talking about
is bills in your wallet...

16:29.550 --> 16:32.110
and me on the Figoratti
racing team, am l right?

16:32.186 --> 16:34.484
Yeah, who said we weren't?
Did somebody say we weren't?

16:34.555 --> 16:38.651
...46, 47, 48, 49, 50.

16:39.460 --> 16:41.052
$50,000.

16:41.329 --> 16:42.853
l have never seen
that much money.

16:42.931 --> 16:45.661
That's truly amazing.
Face, how did you
ever pull this off?

16:45.867 --> 16:48.335
Oh, Kyle Ludwig isn't
such a bad fellow, really.

16:48.603 --> 16:52.505
Once you appeal
to his basic sense of greed,
larceny, corruption.

16:52.807 --> 16:55.776
Ah, you haven't got a hope
in heaven of getting a car
ready in time.

16:55.843 --> 16:58.710
What do you mean,
we ain't got no hope?
B.A., please.

16:58.813 --> 17:01.373
You are our pit crew
inspiration.

17:01.449 --> 17:03.417
lt would be well
for you...

17:03.484 --> 17:05.849
not to dwell
on the probabilities
of ''why not''...

17:05.920 --> 17:08.150
and concern yourself
with ''what if.''

17:08.289 --> 17:11.690
[ High hopes,
he's got high-- [

17:11.759 --> 17:14.227
Come on, guys.
We got a car to buy.

17:14.362 --> 17:18.992
[ ...high hopes, he's got high
Apple pie in the... [[

17:24.271 --> 17:26.297
[electric sander whirring]

17:51.032 --> 17:52.897
Where did Harmon
get that, huh?

17:53.001 --> 17:55.026
[engine roaring]

18:08.649 --> 18:10.116
l don't know, B.A.

18:10.184 --> 18:13.085
l'm just not getting
the power in the turns
like l should.

18:13.154 --> 18:14.951
Hey, Kid,
don't worry about nothing.

18:15.023 --> 18:17.685
l'll work on this car
all night long,
if l have to.

18:18.292 --> 18:20.385
Now, l wouldn't believe
that, Kid, if l were you.

18:20.461 --> 18:23.521
Because if you're planning
on winning that championship
race tomorrow...

18:23.598 --> 18:25.395
you got a whole lot
to worry about.

18:25.733 --> 18:27.098
You must be Kyle Lovesick.

18:27.168 --> 18:28.362
Ludwig.

18:28.536 --> 18:30.060
Kyle Ludwig.

18:30.538 --> 18:32.005
And who are you
supposed to be, huh?

18:32.073 --> 18:34.064
l'm the Clean Racing Fairy.

18:34.142 --> 18:35.507
This is my helper.

18:35.576 --> 18:38.136
Well, it's really nice
to see you fellows again.

18:39.080 --> 18:42.811
Last time l saw you,
you were trying to send
Jack Harmon to his maker.

18:43.718 --> 18:44.980
Remember?

18:45.086 --> 18:46.610
Wait a second,
that was you?

18:48.156 --> 18:50.590
You know, l don't know
how to tell you this, but...

18:50.691 --> 18:51.783
you're dead.

18:51.859 --> 18:54.919
How do you think l got to be
the Clean Racing Fairy?

18:57.365 --> 18:59.856
Now, don't waste
any pixy dust on him.

18:59.934 --> 19:02.232
lt'd probably take
a ton anyway.

19:02.603 --> 19:03.627
Come on, Kid.

19:09.243 --> 19:11.108
That ought to get
his engine started.

19:11.179 --> 19:12.271
Yeah.

19:17.385 --> 19:18.818
Did you hear
what he said, huh?

19:19.287 --> 19:21.619
They're gonna be working
on that car all night long.

19:21.689 --> 19:23.782
Now, by morning
l want the job done...

19:23.858 --> 19:25.951
and this time l want it
done right, you understand?

19:26.027 --> 19:27.790
Because l'm not gonna
look like a fool...

19:27.862 --> 19:30.763
in front of
this ltalian racing guy
during the time trials.

19:30.832 --> 19:32.424
Don't worry,
you can count on us,
Mr. Ludwig.

19:32.500 --> 19:35.799
No, no. Now, this time,
l'm gonna send out
for some professional muscle.

19:38.539 --> 19:40.632
[birds chirping]

19:43.277 --> 19:47.111
lt was pure magic,
watching you fix
Kid Harmon's car.

19:47.315 --> 19:51.809
l mean, the way your hands
just transformed mere metal...

19:51.986 --> 19:55.353
into pure, mystical
motoring magnificence.

19:55.690 --> 19:58.250
Behold, even as we speak,
the legend spreads.

19:58.326 --> 20:00.487
Welcome brothers,
welcome to the very spot...

20:00.561 --> 20:02.358
where future generations
are gonna come...

20:02.430 --> 20:06.298
to see where the mighty B.A.
put camshaft to lathe.

20:06.367 --> 20:07.459
Murdock.

20:07.535 --> 20:12.097
l don't think that
these gentlemen have come
to pay their respects.

20:12.173 --> 20:14.539
What? Blasphemy.
Pay no attention,
big guy.

20:14.609 --> 20:16.008
Everybody out of the garage.

20:16.077 --> 20:17.339
[pleasantly]
Oh, all right.

20:22.850 --> 20:24.215
What are you gonna do
with that?

20:24.285 --> 20:27.345
We're gonna see
if the smoke detector
in your garage is working.

20:27.421 --> 20:28.752
You don't wanna
do that, sucker.

20:33.394 --> 20:37.125
Avert your eyes, B.A.
Look not onto this travesty.

20:45.106 --> 20:49.042
Looks like the smoke detector
in your garage is working
just fine.

20:49.443 --> 20:51.570
l can't believe
you did this.

20:51.746 --> 20:54.874
l mean, that car
must be worth a fortune.

20:55.449 --> 20:56.541
Yeah?

20:57.185 --> 20:58.914
Breaks my heart.

20:58.986 --> 21:00.112
[chuckling]
Well...

21:00.188 --> 21:02.315
when Kyle Ludwig
finds out...

21:02.390 --> 21:05.291
that you just torched
his best race car...

21:05.359 --> 21:07.623
he's gonna break
more than that.

21:07.695 --> 21:09.595
What are you
talking about?

21:10.164 --> 21:11.256
B.A.?

21:18.105 --> 21:19.766
l told you
you didn't wanna
do this, sucker.

21:24.245 --> 21:26.179
Now, don't you feel
like a dum-dum?

21:26.881 --> 21:27.973
Now...

21:28.482 --> 21:30.916
we're gonna tie you guys up
and leave you for
the authorities.

You can explain
your eyewitness view...

an Arson Fire.''

21:47.401 --> 21:51.861
l cannot believe l'm driving
a piece of junk like this
in a championship race.

21:52.573 --> 21:54.768
Ah, Kyle,
good morning.

21:55.243 --> 21:57.768
Pacini. How are you?
Nice to see you.
Nice to be seen.

21:57.845 --> 21:59.642
Listen, l got a surprise
visitor for you.

21:59.714 --> 22:03.275
Kyle Ludwig, may l present
Signore Giancarlo Figoratti.

22:03.985 --> 22:07.148
He wanted to meet you
in person. l know,
call him impulsive.

22:07.221 --> 22:09.553
[imitating ltalian accent]
Hello. How are you today?

22:09.624 --> 22:10.716
l'm fine, l'm fine.

22:10.791 --> 22:13.487
Listen, this is
a real pleasure for me,
and an honor.

22:13.561 --> 22:15.620
Hello. How are you
today, eh?

22:16.330 --> 22:19.322
Fine.
Mr. Figoratti doesn't
speak much English.

22:19.533 --> 22:21.558
Well that's too bad
because, you know...

22:21.636 --> 22:23.194
[laughing]
l don't speak ltalian.

22:23.271 --> 22:26.035
Hello. How are you today?

22:26.407 --> 22:27.499
l'm fine.

22:33.247 --> 22:35.681
Hey, Kyle.
Too bad about your car.

22:37.218 --> 22:40.710
[in ltalian]

22:40.888 --> 22:41.980
What'd he say?

22:42.256 --> 22:46.124
Oh, he says that,
that is a very fine-looking
racing machine.

22:46.560 --> 22:49.324
Well, you tell him for me,
that it's not so much
the car...

22:49.397 --> 22:50.989
it's the man
behind the wheel.

22:51.065 --> 22:52.191
You got that, Kid?

22:52.833 --> 22:55.131
(male announcer on PA)
Gentlemen,
start your engines.

22:55.569 --> 22:57.628
[imitating engine roaring]
Excuse me, pal.

23:03.444 --> 23:07.039
[engine revving]
B.A., that engine sounds
as smooth as honey.

23:12.820 --> 23:14.549
[tires screeching]

23:16.324 --> 23:19.555
(announcer on PA)
Kid Harmon's got the jump
on Kyle Ludwig on the start.

23:20.828 --> 23:24.059
Harmon, in car number 4,
is holding his lead
through Turn 2.

23:35.609 --> 23:36.837
[inaudible]

23:47.355 --> 23:51.416
Ludwig, in number 98,
has slipped under Kid Harmon,
entering Turn 4.

23:51.492 --> 23:53.687
He's holding the lead
down the front straight.

24:09.810 --> 24:12.074
Kid Harmon's squeezed
inside Ludwig.

24:12.146 --> 24:14.944
He's definitely not afraid
to swab clean out there.

24:15.950 --> 24:17.281
It's gonna be close...

24:17.351 --> 24:20.377
but it's Kid Harmon
taking the checkered flag
for the win.

24:25.126 --> 24:27.526
[crowd cheering]

24:40.741 --> 24:42.402
[people whistling]

24:52.353 --> 24:54.617
Nice job.
Nice job, huh?

25:03.931 --> 25:05.057
Uncle John!

25:05.132 --> 25:06.292
We did it, huh?

25:06.801 --> 25:09.235
Congratulations, Kid,
you're learning.

25:14.608 --> 25:17.042
All right, let's get ready
for the main event.

25:17.111 --> 25:18.100
All right.

25:18.746 --> 25:20.111
Colonel Decker, please.

25:21.182 --> 25:23.207
Yeah, this is Jack Harmon.

25:25.419 --> 25:27.410
Well, you can tell
the Colonel from me...

25:27.822 --> 25:29.585
that l know where
he can get his hands...

25:29.657 --> 25:31.716
on Colonel John Smith
and the A-Team.

25:40.067 --> 25:41.500
[[[music playing]

And for you....

25:41.769 --> 25:43.566
[women giggling]
(Murdock)
Ah....

25:43.637 --> 25:45.002
[Murdock and Face laughing]

25:45.072 --> 25:47.006
Uh-oh, we're almost
out of champagne.

25:47.074 --> 25:48.701
Down to a scant
six bottles.

25:49.109 --> 25:50.235
Yo!

25:50.311 --> 25:52.336
More refreshments,
if you please.

25:53.681 --> 25:54.705
Now....

25:56.417 --> 25:58.385
You're really running up
quite a tab here.

25:58.452 --> 25:59.976
l believe...

26:00.054 --> 26:03.581
my close personal friend,
Mr. Kyle Ludwig, asked you
to take care of us.

26:04.158 --> 26:06.820
Yeah, good help
is so hard to find
these days.

26:07.828 --> 26:12.561
[in ltalian]

26:13.200 --> 26:15.395
What did you say,
Giancarlo ?

26:15.803 --> 26:18.829
Oh, he said
that your hair is...

26:19.139 --> 26:20.470
lovely in this light.

26:20.541 --> 26:22.509
Oh, he's so cute.

26:23.344 --> 26:27.576
[in ltalian]

26:28.048 --> 26:29.174
What did he say?

26:30.317 --> 26:32.080
He said, ''So are you.''

26:53.073 --> 26:54.438
So, what is all this?

26:54.508 --> 26:56.976
These guys can really
put away the bubbly,
Mr. Ludwig.

26:57.044 --> 26:59.877
You give them
anything they want,
you understand? Anything.

27:00.381 --> 27:01.473
So...

27:01.715 --> 27:05.276
l trust you gentlemen
are enjoying yourselves?
Obviously you are.

27:05.352 --> 27:07.786
Yes, as a matter of fact,
we are.

27:08.489 --> 27:10.548
The water's perfect.
Why don't you join us?

27:10.624 --> 27:12.148
Oh, no, no.
Maybe later, huh?

[in ltalian]

27:15.429 --> 27:17.056
Uh-oh...

27:17.131 --> 27:20.965
l'm afraid Signore Figoratti
is a little concerned...

27:21.035 --> 27:23.196
about your performance
in the qualifying race today.

27:23.270 --> 27:25.830
Concerned? What's he got
to be concerned about?
l had a bad day.

27:25.906 --> 27:27.567
l mean,
he's gotta understand that.
You tell him that.

27:27.675 --> 27:32.169
[in ltalian]

27:32.346 --> 27:33.506
Yes, yes, of course.

27:33.581 --> 27:34.809
[stuttering]
What is it?

27:34.882 --> 27:36.850
lt seems that
he was impressed...

27:36.917 --> 27:39.977
with the performance
of that other
young driver, Kid...

27:40.054 --> 27:41.112
Harmon.

27:41.188 --> 27:44.453
Now, you listen to me.
You forget about Kid Harmon,
you understand?

27:44.525 --> 27:47.221
l got a $50,000 investment
on our little friendship...

27:47.294 --> 27:50.661
and either you help me out
with Figoratti or you're gonna
find yourself...

27:50.731 --> 27:53.393
floating face down
in my beautiful swimming pool,
you understand?

27:53.467 --> 27:57.096
[stuttering]
l'll do what l can,
Mr. Ludwig, but...

27:57.438 --> 27:59.872
if Harmon wins
that championship, well...

27:59.940 --> 28:02.738
Signore Figoratti,
he's bound to notice.

28:02.876 --> 28:06.209
Hello. How are you today?

28:06.647 --> 28:07.739
l'm fine.

28:09.516 --> 28:12.815
Look, you leave Kid Harmon
to me, all right? lt's wired.

28:13.420 --> 28:17.049
l've got some drivers
on the payroll to make sure
he never finishes the race.

28:17.124 --> 28:19.456
You are a very creative man.

28:20.294 --> 28:25.288
[in ltalian]

28:26.133 --> 28:27.259
Right.

28:29.470 --> 28:32.530
lt's looking real good, Kid.
We checked out everything.

28:32.606 --> 28:35.336
Rod bearings,
gaskets, the works.

28:35.409 --> 28:37.741
You gonna have
the fastest car
in the race tomorrow.

28:37.811 --> 28:40.245
Wow, B.A., man.
Thanks.

28:40.714 --> 28:43.114
When Murdock said
you were the best
mechanic in the world...

28:43.183 --> 28:44.207
he wasn't fooling.

28:44.284 --> 28:45.911
B.A. didn't do
all the work, Kid.

28:45.986 --> 28:47.920
Your father supervised
the whole job.

28:48.188 --> 28:49.177
That's right.

28:49.456 --> 28:53.051
lt was his idea
to equalize the air-fuel
distribution, too.

28:53.127 --> 28:55.595
To Jack Harmon,
the old drunk, right?

28:55.663 --> 28:58.131
The old man,
he needs some love
and attention...

28:58.198 --> 29:00.257
so why not let him
tinker around
with the automobile...

29:00.334 --> 29:02.666
so he that feels part of it?
Hmm?

29:03.137 --> 29:04.365
lsn't he sad?

29:04.438 --> 29:05.462
Hey.

29:05.639 --> 29:08.767
Who the hell
do you think you are, talking
to Uncle John like that?

29:09.243 --> 29:10.870
lf it wasn't for him
and the A-Team...

29:10.944 --> 29:12.844
l'd still be back
in that hospital,
thanks to you.

29:12.913 --> 29:13.937
Thanks to me?
Yeah.

29:14.014 --> 29:16.812
That's enough, Kid.
No. No, it isn't.
lt's time we had it out.

29:17.184 --> 29:19.880
lt's time you heard
how sick and tired
l am of your drinking...

29:19.953 --> 29:21.545
and your excuses
for everything.

29:21.622 --> 29:23.180
And you know what else,
Uncle John?

29:23.257 --> 29:24.884
He's always
badmouthing you.

29:24.958 --> 29:27.051
And he showed me
these newspaper clippings
to prove it.

29:27.127 --> 29:29.322
Well, l don't care
how many times
you tell me, Dad...

29:29.396 --> 29:31.864
l know he didn't commit
those crimes in the army.

29:31.965 --> 29:35.025
l know he's innocent.
And l know he's my friend!

29:38.138 --> 29:40.834
Well, you did it.
Congratulations.

29:41.575 --> 29:44.442
You turned my son against me.
You got even.

29:53.587 --> 29:55.885
Guess l'll go
relieve Murdock.

29:55.956 --> 29:57.617
Yeah, thanks, B.A.

29:59.093 --> 30:00.856
Feel like taking
a swing at me, Kid?

30:00.928 --> 30:02.395
No. Of course not.

30:02.463 --> 30:04.590
Then you shouldn't be
swinging at your father,
either.

30:04.665 --> 30:05.996
l'm sorry.

30:06.467 --> 30:08.765
Uncle John, what did he mean
when he said you got even?

30:09.169 --> 30:10.363
Well...

30:10.804 --> 30:12.499
you loved your mother,
didn't you, Kid?

30:12.573 --> 30:13.733
Yeah, you know l did.

30:14.007 --> 30:16.567
So did l. A long time ago.

30:16.643 --> 30:18.577
Your father and l,
both did.
What?

30:18.645 --> 30:20.545
Yeah. When we were
about your age...

30:21.381 --> 30:23.212
we both went after
the same girl.

30:23.550 --> 30:26.713
Your mother. She was
the most beautiful thing
you ever saw.

30:27.221 --> 30:29.348
And we were both
crazy about her.

30:29.790 --> 30:32.759
We both proposed,
and she had to choose
between us.

30:32.826 --> 30:33.918
No way.

30:33.994 --> 30:37.088
l don't believe she had
the chance to choose you
and she picks him.

30:37.164 --> 30:38.825
[laughing]
Oh, yes.

30:39.666 --> 30:43.466
She chose your father
for all the things he was
and l wasn't.

30:44.338 --> 30:45.828
Family-oriented...

30:45.906 --> 30:50.070
secure in his job,
and always there for her.

30:50.611 --> 30:54.411
And when she died, that's
when he started to drink.

30:54.882 --> 30:58.841
Now, maybe you and l could
help him find his way back.

30:59.887 --> 31:01.184
l don't know.

31:02.823 --> 31:04.120
You think about it.

31:11.899 --> 31:13.890
Hey, B.A., where's Hannibal?
He went into the house.

31:13.967 --> 31:15.764
Oh, well, l gotta talk
to him right away.

31:15.836 --> 31:18.999

to go after Kid in the race.

Roll them out.

38:24.497 --> 38:26.465
Yeah. Take it easy.
There you go.

38:26.533 --> 38:29.297
Take it easy, Bessie.
Take it easy.

38:30.604 --> 38:33.903
Think of
how your milk's gonna make
all those boys and girls...

38:33.974 --> 38:37.774
nice and healthy and strong,
and just think of how proud
B.A. is going to be of you.

38:40.947 --> 38:43.973
God, this is a terrible road.
Why'd we have to come
this way?

38:44.751 --> 38:47.345
lt's the only other way
back to the interstate.

38:47.554 --> 38:49.021

What's this?

38:51.958 --> 38:53.425
[[[singing]

do that someplace else?
We're in a hurry here.

39:03.403 --> 39:05.132
Hey, you from the city, boy?

39:05.205 --> 39:07.196
Well, yeah
What's that got to do
with moving the cow?

39:07.274 --> 39:11.074
Well, l thought as much,
'cause lf you spent
any time on a farm...

39:11.144 --> 39:15.444
you'd know that
when a lady like Bessie here
wants to give milk...

39:15.515 --> 39:17.676
[laughing]
she gives milk.

39:19.753 --> 39:21.482
Aw, take
a little bit more.

39:21.588 --> 39:22.577
Yeah.

39:24.524 --> 39:26.287
Hey, Hank, you wanna
give us a hand here?

Good afternoon, gentlemen.

This is your captain,
once again taking you
under my wing...

40:13.340 --> 40:15.968
by keeping you close
to my heart,
which is where you belong.

Hello, Wilbur.

40:20.613 --> 40:22.342
Wilbur? Who is this?

40:22.982 --> 40:25.109
So you are looking
for the A-Team?

40:25.185 --> 40:27.153
You're out of luck, Wilbur!

40:27.220 --> 40:29.154
The A-Team?
What about the A-Team?

40:31.324 --> 40:32.985
Colonel.
Captain?

40:33.593 --> 40:35.060
The A-Team has escaped.

40:35.128 --> 40:36.288
Escaped?
Yes, sir.

40:36.363 --> 40:38.263
How? Who's responsible?

40:40.400 --> 40:42.960
But l know
how Smith thinks, Captain.

40:43.036 --> 40:46.335
He won't leave this area
till his business
with Kid Harmon is finished.

40:46.406 --> 40:48.874
You can count on it.
Let's move out.

Katz in 01 is all over
Kid Harmon...

40:59.552 --> 41:01.076
down the back straight.

41:09.929 --> 41:13.797
Jones in the 16 car
is smoking under-braking
into the turns.

41:13.867 --> 41:15.926
He could be looking at
a black flag soon.

41:16.069 --> 41:18.162
How's it going, Jack?
Yeah, well....

41:18.638 --> 41:20.868
John?
What are you doing here?
We'll talk later.

41:20.940 --> 41:22.999
But Colonel Decker
will be here
looking for you.

41:23.076 --> 41:24.134
Hmm.

41:25.044 --> 41:27.035
l'd be disappointed
if he wasn't.

41:29.416 --> 41:31.611
That's one of Ludwig's men
over there.

41:31.718 --> 41:33.515
We're in position,
Colonel.

41:33.586 --> 41:35.451
Okay, good.

41:35.522 --> 41:38.616
Number 16 is throwing
a little smoke now.

41:39.559 --> 41:42.027
You guys be sure
our boy gets a fair race.

What?

lt dropped!

42:06.986 --> 42:09.580
l sure hope
his sister's kidney turns out
all right. Poor thing.

42:09.656 --> 42:13.023
We're gonna have to remember
to send her a get-well card.
What do you think?

42:13.293 --> 42:14.783
You don't think
anything.

42:21.034 --> 42:22.126
Hey, who the heck
are you?

42:22.202 --> 42:24.397
Don't worry about anything.
Jones had an emergency.

42:24.471 --> 42:28.066
This is his twin brother.
Don't you say anything,
don't you say one thing.

Jones at number 16 is
back in the competition.

42:43.022 --> 42:44.114
he's right ahead of you.
There you go.

Dad, they're trying
to run him off the track.

l know it.
(Hannibal)
Now, Dana, relax.

42:51.798 --> 42:53.823
We got a little plan.

42:53.900 --> 42:55.492
Okay, B.A.

42:55.568 --> 42:58.935
Give that powder puff
a little jolt of adrenalin.

42:59.205 --> 43:00.331
You got it.

43:13.753 --> 43:16.881
(announcer on PA)
Katz in 01 is cartwheeling
through the infield.

43:21.361 --> 43:23.295
Attaboy, B.A., attaboy.
Way to go.

43:26.232 --> 43:30.999
Katz is out of the car.
He's shaken, but walking
under his own power..

43:31.070 --> 43:32.935
All right, now take care
of the other slime balls.

43:33.006 --> 43:33.995
(B.A.)
I'm on it.

43:34.073 --> 43:36.098
Uh-oh. Better
hurry it up, Hannibal.

43:36.175 --> 43:37.972
Looks like Decker's got
a surprise party for us.

43:45.151 --> 43:46.709
Well, things are
getting interesting.

43:46.786 --> 43:48.014
(Jack)
You gotta get out of here.

43:48.087 --> 43:50.055
He's going to come
and pick you up
and you know that.

43:50.123 --> 43:51.613
Relax, Jack,
we got plenty of time.

43:51.691 --> 43:54.159
Enjoy the end of the race.
Here they come.

43:54.227 --> 43:58.596
lf the A-Team's inside
these walls,
they'd better not escape.

43:59.032 --> 44:00.522
You two,
take those bleachers...

44:00.600 --> 44:02.795
Captain, take the men
and look those bleachers over.

Disperse!

The 16 car's up
on Szollosi in 95.

It's getting mean out there.

44:30.430 --> 44:32.295
16 and 95 touch.

44:59.759 --> 45:01.556
The Kid has closed on Ludwig.

45:22.181 --> 45:25.275
He's alongside.
He's nosing him
on the inside...

45:25.351 --> 45:27.615
and he triumphs at the flag.

45:29.856 --> 45:30.914

old man.

45:59.986 --> 46:00.975
[groans]

46:03.156 --> 46:05.181
l should have done that
a long time ago.

46:10.063 --> 46:11.428
What a happy day, huh?

46:23.476 --> 46:24.602
[tires screeching]
There they go!

46:38.324 --> 46:41.191
l love it when a plan
comes together.

46:52.972 --> 46:54.633
[all cheering]
All right!
Check it out!

46:54.807 --> 46:55.933
[cheering]

46:56.175 --> 46:58.871
Can you believe it?
lsn't this the biggest thing
you've ever seen?

46:58.945 --> 47:00.742
(Hannibal)
lndeed.
lt is great, man.

47:00.813 --> 47:04.146
Well, we'll just have
to build an addition to
the house just to keep it in.

47:04.217 --> 47:06.014
We'll have to build
that addition
to the house...

47:06.085 --> 47:07.313
just to put
all our kids in.

47:07.386 --> 47:10.878
Let me get through
this one first, okay?
Okay.

47:10.957 --> 47:13.187
Uncle John, l don't know
how we can thank you enough...

47:13.259 --> 47:17.093
for all that you, and Face,
B.A., and Murdock did.

47:17.163 --> 47:18.824
Oh, it's nothing, Dana.

47:18.898 --> 47:20.490
You know, the thing
l don't understand...

47:20.566 --> 47:23.228
is how did Colonel Decker
ever find out
that you were here?

47:23.536 --> 47:24.662
Oh, well...

47:24.737 --> 47:27.968
Decker may be obnoxious,
but he's very determined.

47:28.641 --> 47:32.475
Listen, son, there's something
you ought to know about that.

47:32.545 --> 47:35.070
Yes, your father
promised me...

47:35.148 --> 47:37.673
that he would personally
ask around quietly...

47:37.750 --> 47:41.208
and find out exactly
what happened,
like the good friend he is.

47:43.689 --> 47:45.680
And a good friend
l'll always be.

47:53.866 --> 47:56.027
Well, we better
get going, huh?

47:56.102 --> 47:59.868
[in ltalian accent]
Si, si. We hate to go but
we got to fly back to Rome...

47:59.939 --> 48:04.706
where our families
are awaiting
the traditional grape harvest.

48:04.911 --> 48:07.402
That's right, Murdock.
You remember?

48:07.814 --> 48:09.247
And we don't wanna be late.

48:09.315 --> 48:12.045
And l especially like
the part where we get
to stomp the grapes.

48:12.118 --> 48:14.814
And we keep on stomping them,
all day long.

48:14.887 --> 48:16.752
(Murdock)
You don't have
to get so riled up!

48:16.823 --> 48:19.053
