[screeching]

02:05.115 --> 02:10.741
[cell phone rings]

02:11.621 --> 02:14.081
[ring ring]

02:14.499 --> 02:16.125
It's not the time
to start playing it safe.

02:31.766 --> 02:33.850
Son, you have to drop.
That's playing to lose.

02:33.851 --> 02:36.111
- You gotta listen to me.
- I been listening to you my whole life.

02:36.112 --> 02:37.562
You gotta put some pressure on.

02:41.233 --> 02:42.400
[ring]

02:47.239 --> 02:49.199
[MAN]: How can a game...

02:49.200 --> 02:52.077
have such an effect on man's soul?

02:52.078 --> 02:54.079
The way I see it,

02:54.080 --> 02:55.872
how can it not?

02:55.873 --> 02:59.083
You don't choose the game.
It chooses you.

02:59.084 --> 03:00.709
And when it does,

03:00.710 --> 03:04.421
life and golf become forever connected.

03:04.422 --> 03:08.425
That's how it was for a young man
named Luke Chisolm.

03:30.781 --> 03:33.366
You've got to be kidding me.

03:42.709 --> 03:44.551
[moo]

04:13.865 --> 04:15.907
[groans, sighs]

04:17.452 --> 04:18.910
[bull bellows]

04:20.663 --> 04:22.873
[ANNOUNCER]: Once you make
one mistake out of the water there,

04:22.874 --> 04:26.083
you just continue to make the same
mistake over and over again.

04:28.879 --> 04:30.504
[mutters angrily]

04:45.896 --> 04:47.855
[horse whinnies]

04:56.947 --> 04:58.323
Are you hurt, son?

05:01.002 --> 05:03.861
Uh... [clears throat]
I'll get over it.

05:05.331 --> 05:06.581
Yeah.

05:10.127 --> 05:13.087
You the guy I saw putting
the flagstick in the field?

05:13.088 --> 05:17.175
Yeah, and you the guy that...
crashed through my fence?

05:19.678 --> 05:22.263
Here. Let me help you.

05:22.264 --> 05:24.848
Johnny Crawford's the name.

05:24.849 --> 05:26.850
- Luke Chisolm.
- Yeah.

05:26.851 --> 05:28.435
Yeah, let me see that.

05:28.436 --> 05:30.020
Yeah, look...

05:31.606 --> 05:34.775
Put a little pressure on there.
It'll stop the bleeding.

05:34.776 --> 05:36.777
- All right.
- Yeah.

05:36.778 --> 05:39.230
- Thanks.
- I need to get you to my...

05:39.231 --> 05:41.990
truck to get you
some medical attention, alright?

05:41.991 --> 05:44.117
So let's get these clubs up here.

05:45.537 --> 05:47.162
You feel all right?
You're not dizzy?

05:47.163 --> 05:49.164
No, I'll be all right.
[mutters]

05:50.208 --> 05:52.792
You're a hell of a driver.

05:54.753 --> 05:58.130
373 people?

05:58.131 --> 05:59.674
375.

05:59.675 --> 06:01.676
Megan Monroe had twins last week.

06:01.677 --> 06:06.222
Yeah. Haven't taken the sign down yet.

06:06.640 --> 06:08.182
The evening service...
[bell chimes]

06:08.183 --> 06:09.141
is just letting out.

06:09.142 --> 06:11.561
- [WOMAN]: Hey, Johnny.
- Hey, how you doing?

06:12.980 --> 06:16.148
I went this morning,
in case you was wondering.

06:20.195 --> 06:23.780
[country-western music plays]

06:24.198 --> 06:26.449
- Order up.
- Let me guess.

06:26.450 --> 06:28.827
- Same as usual.
- You got it.

06:29.036 --> 06:31.371
- All right, you all done there, darlin'?
- Divine.

06:32.540 --> 06:34.291
How y'all doing here?
Some more coffee?

06:34.292 --> 06:36.876
[WOMAN AT TABLE]:
What's wrong with him asking her out?

06:36.877 --> 06:39.337
Oh, Sarah, I could use
some more coffee.

06:40.381 --> 06:41.590
Excuse me.

06:43.009 --> 06:44.426
How you boys doing here?

06:44.427 --> 06:46.511
You gonna save a dance
for me tonight?

06:47.930 --> 06:49.472
I'll think about it.

06:50.849 --> 06:52.308
[man laughs]

06:52.309 --> 06:54.351
She's just playing hard to get.
Of course she is.

06:55.812 --> 06:56.812
[bell jingles]

07:00.442 --> 07:02.526
[jingling]
Mama, it's Uncle Johnny.

07:03.945 --> 07:04.987
[JOHNNY]: Hi, everybody.

07:04.988 --> 07:06.363
This here's Luke.

07:06.364 --> 07:09.783
He's had a small accident, but, uh...

07:09.784 --> 07:11.285
Do we have that aid kit back there?

07:11.286 --> 07:13.203
I'll get it, Mom.

07:13.204 --> 07:16.624
[MOTHER]: Johnny, what in the world
happened to this poor boy?

07:18.752 --> 07:20.293
Don't worry. He's gonna live.

07:20.294 --> 07:22.712
Mercy. Looks like
you've been hit by a truck.

07:22.713 --> 07:24.380
More like a cow.

07:24.381 --> 07:25.882
You hit a cow?

07:25.883 --> 07:28.301
[men laugh]

07:28.302 --> 07:29.427
No, I missed the cow,

07:29.428 --> 07:31.262
but I did manage
to run through the fence.

07:31.263 --> 07:33.139
- [laughter]
- [MAN]: City boy can't drive.

07:33.140 --> 07:34.891
Do you need a doctor?

07:35.434 --> 07:37.226
No, ma'am.

07:37.227 --> 07:38.686
I need a mechanic.

07:38.687 --> 07:41.022
[chuckles]
Here you go.

07:41.023 --> 07:43.232
- Thank you.
- Sure.

07:43.233 --> 07:47.195
We need some strong hands
to get the car over to Brody's shop.

07:47.196 --> 07:49.112
Jake, be a dear and help Johnny.

07:49.113 --> 07:50.697
What about my burger?

07:50.698 --> 07:54.159
The poor man's car just got wrecked,
and you're worrying about a burger?

07:54.160 --> 07:56.078
Where are your manners?

07:56.079 --> 07:57.496
[JOHNNY]: Come on, Jake.
Let's go. Let's go.

07:57.497 --> 07:58.497
Jake, come on.

07:58.498 --> 08:00.540
[SEATED MAN]: Have fun.

08:00.541 --> 08:02.250
Come on, Smiley. You, too.

08:02.251 --> 08:05.504
Work some of that off.
- Yes, sir.

08:05.505 --> 08:07.130
- Come on.
- Come on, Chuck.

08:07.131 --> 08:09.174
[JOHNNY]: Let's go.

08:09.175 --> 08:10.884
- Sarah?
- Hmm?

08:12.387 --> 08:13.512
Drive Luke to the inn.

08:13.513 --> 08:15.222
I'd be much... much obliged.
Thank you.

08:15.223 --> 08:16.640
Sure.

08:19.518 --> 08:21.852
There you go.

08:23.146 --> 08:24.689
Just let me know
whenever you're ready.

08:25.482 --> 08:26.565
Oh.

08:29.528 --> 08:30.444
Mom, we'll be right back.

08:31.029 --> 08:33.447
- Thank you, ma'am.
- [MOTHER]: Drive careful.

08:33.823 --> 08:39.370
[WOMAN]: ¶ Are you right?
Will this end in tears? ¶

08:39.871 --> 08:40.955
[SARAH]: Where you from?

08:41.581 --> 08:42.623
[LUKE]: Waco.

08:42.624 --> 08:44.750
But I've been on the road
these past couple of years.

08:44.751 --> 08:46.627
Yeah? Me, too.

08:47.795 --> 08:49.045
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

08:49.046 --> 08:50.922
What for, school?

08:50.923 --> 08:53.341
I'm training to be a horse whisperer.

08:54.635 --> 08:57.637
I always thought horse whispering
was only in the movies.

08:57.638 --> 08:59.639
But it's for real, huh?

08:59.640 --> 09:02.183
Yep.

09:02.184 --> 09:04.227
Well, good luck with that.

09:04.228 --> 09:06.271
Thank you.

09:06.689 --> 09:08.273
So where you taking me, anyway?

09:08.274 --> 09:09.858
Oh, we're just going to the River Inn.

09:09.859 --> 09:11.860
That's Uncle Johnny's place.

09:11.861 --> 09:14.070
Are you two related?

09:15.030 --> 09:17.197
No, he's just a close family friend,

09:17.198 --> 09:19.867
but I've always known him
as Uncle Johnny.

09:19.868 --> 09:21.493
Here we are.

09:24.080 --> 09:25.831
Well, thanks for the ride.

09:25.832 --> 09:29.084
Right. Oh, you have to get that
from the outside.

09:37.260 --> 09:44.308
¶ Feeling it all as the wind blows ¶

09:44.309 --> 09:52.064
¶ Feeling it all as the time goes ¶

09:52.065 --> 09:58.738
¶ Do you feel my eyes
right there on you? ¶

09:58.739 --> 10:00.907
[knocking]

10:02.993 --> 10:04.410
Hello?

10:08.791 --> 10:12.418
Don't you even think about
coming in here with those.

10:14.462 --> 10:16.838
You must be the one
who ran off the road.

10:16.839 --> 10:19.341
What'd you do,
fall asleep at the wheel?

10:20.718 --> 10:21.968
Well, come on.

10:21.969 --> 10:24.262
I don't have all day to check you in.
Let's go.

10:26.474 --> 10:29.142
And close that door behind you.

10:32.355 --> 10:34.272
You're not bad looking.

10:34.273 --> 10:36.066
Blind as a bat, maybe.

10:36.067 --> 10:38.819
You married? The neighbor girl's
looking for a husband.

10:38.820 --> 10:40.654
No, ma'am. I'm not married.

10:40.655 --> 10:41.905
Okay, now don't lose this key.

10:41.906 --> 10:43.364
It opens the front door, too,

10:43.365 --> 10:46.242
so you don't bother me
when you drag in late.

10:46.243 --> 10:47.910
Yes, ma'am.

10:47.911 --> 10:50.538
There's extra towels
in the cupboard there,

10:50.539 --> 10:53.332
but it's okay to use
the same one twice.

10:53.333 --> 10:54.917
Breakfast is at 8:00.

10:54.918 --> 10:56.335
Don't be late.

11:09.474 --> 11:10.349
[click]

11:10.350 --> 11:12.392
[peaceful music, dog barking]

11:13.227 --> 11:14.394
[click, upbeat music]

11:22.069 --> 11:24.028
Hi there. Thanks for teeing it up
with us here on Golf Central.

11:24.029 --> 11:25.655
I'm Todd Lewis,
sitting beside Frank Nobilo,

11:25.656 --> 11:28.241
and, Frank, we begin with
that unbelievable story

11:28.242 --> 11:30.827
happening at the Callaway
San Antonio Open.

11:30.828 --> 11:31.953
Well, that's right, Todd.

11:31.954 --> 11:34.455
Luke Chisolm is a name that we've
all had on our radar screens

11:34.456 --> 11:37.125
ever since he won the Texas State
Amateur Championship.

11:37.126 --> 11:39.168
Folks, if you have not seen
this highlight before,

11:39.169 --> 11:40.795
sit back and enjoy.

11:40.796 --> 11:42.671
It's something you will not forget.

11:42.672 --> 11:44.631
The winner of this tournament
earns an exemption...

11:44.632 --> 11:47.634
into the Valero Texas Open
just a few weeks from now.

11:47.635 --> 11:51.096
Luke Chisolm had a one-shot lead
on the final hole over Joe Buckner,

11:51.097 --> 11:52.681
Father Martin on the bag,

11:52.682 --> 11:54.057
and look who shows up
on the tee:

11:54.058 --> 11:56.059
The number one player
on the planet...

11:56.060 --> 11:58.520
and the tournament's lead sponsor,
T.K. Oh.

11:58.521 --> 12:00.105
What an intimidating presence.

12:00.106 --> 12:03.108
Well, that's enough
to rattle anybody's cage,

12:03.109 --> 12:05.777
and in this situation, Luke Chisolm,

12:05.778 --> 12:08.196
he just blocks his tee shot way right.

12:08.197 --> 12:10.364
His dad Martin wanted him...

12:10.365 --> 12:12.074
Three-iron.

12:12.075 --> 12:14.243
Whoa.

12:14.244 --> 12:16.537
It's not the time
to start playing it safe.

12:16.538 --> 12:17.788
Yeah, but if I make par,

12:17.789 --> 12:19.373
he's gotta make birdie to tie me.

12:19.374 --> 12:22.668
You're playing not to lose
instead of playing to win.

12:22.669 --> 12:24.170
Here.

12:24.171 --> 12:27.048
Remember who won
the Masters last year?

12:27.049 --> 12:29.300
Well, that guy over there.

12:29.301 --> 12:32.053
Yeah, that guy over there.
T.K. Oh, got his fourth green jacket.

12:32.054 --> 12:33.679
Remember who come in second?

12:36.058 --> 12:38.142
Nobody remembers
the runner-up, Luke.

12:38.143 --> 12:41.353
You can get on the green in two
if you hit it with the big stick.

13:12.801 --> 13:15.427
[crowd moans]

13:19.391 --> 13:20.599
That one hurt.

13:20.600 --> 13:21.809
You wanna hit a few?

13:21.810 --> 13:23.560
Your hand up to it?

13:28.942 --> 13:30.901
[CROWD]: Ooh... ooh.

13:30.902 --> 13:31.986
[MAN IN CROWD]:
Come on, Luke.

13:31.987 --> 13:33.946
Right into trouble.

13:34.739 --> 13:35.698
Thread the needle with a 3-iron.

13:35.699 --> 13:37.657
You bump and run it up on the green.

13:37.658 --> 13:39.283
I think I should just punch out
right here.

13:39.284 --> 13:42.829
You got to put some pressure on.
Hit the 3.

13:46.250 --> 13:47.542
Hit the 3, huh?

13:47.543 --> 13:51.796
Hey, Mama, there's an Easter egg
hunt at the church tomorrow.

13:51.797 --> 13:53.881
Sounds like fun.

13:53.882 --> 13:55.800
Can we go, Dad?

13:55.801 --> 13:58.094
You got some practicing to do tomorrow.

13:58.095 --> 13:59.595
Martin, it's Easter Sunday.

13:59.596 --> 14:01.264
Sundays are reserved for golf.

14:03.684 --> 14:06.518
Son, you have to drop.
That's playing to lose.

14:06.519 --> 14:07.853
You gotta listen to me.

14:07.854 --> 14:09.354
I've been listening to you
my whole life

14:09.355 --> 14:10.439
and this is where it's got me.

14:14.527 --> 14:15.777
All right.
Where you gonna put it?

14:18.281 --> 14:19.489
I hope he brought a snorkel.

14:19.490 --> 14:20.949
All right.
Let's see what you got.

14:20.950 --> 14:23.285
You gotta pull yourself
together here, son.

14:23.286 --> 14:24.286
Am I embarrassing you?

14:24.287 --> 14:26.705
You hooked it.

14:26.706 --> 14:28.832
You gotta watch your right hand.

14:28.833 --> 14:30.000
There you go.

14:30.001 --> 14:31.501
Let it release.

14:33.296 --> 14:35.671
Come on, now.
Let's get something started here.

14:38.884 --> 14:41.343
Don't flip it.
Come on, now.

14:41.344 --> 14:43.554
Come on.
One more good one.

14:43.555 --> 14:45.473
[MAN IN CROWD]: In the hole!

14:45.474 --> 14:47.516
[CROWD]: Oh!

14:47.517 --> 14:48.642
Give me another one.

14:54.775 --> 14:55.608
[CROWD]: Oh!

14:56.860 --> 14:58.944
Well now, you're playing not to lose
instead of playing to win.

15:00.614 --> 15:02.698
Nobody remembers
the runner-up, Luke.

15:03.533 --> 15:05.366
- God!
- You gotta put some pressure on him.

15:05.367 --> 15:06.785
Hit the 3.

15:14.794 --> 15:17.796
[TODD LEWIS]:
He snaps his putter, flings the shaft,

15:17.797 --> 15:19.172
and then the sad shot here,

15:19.173 --> 15:23.593
his father Martin, walking away
from son on the final hole.

15:23.594 --> 15:27.931
Oh, my goodness. He ends up
shooting an 80 on the day.

15:27.932 --> 15:31.267
We're gonna look at the one that started
what I believe was the meltdown...

15:31.268 --> 15:34.186
when he hit it into the hazard
and going forth from there, Frank.

15:34.187 --> 15:35.395
What was going through his mind?

15:35.396 --> 15:36.688
[FRANK NOBILO]:
Well, I think he was still smarting,

15:36.689 --> 15:38.273
Todd with the decision
he made off the tee,

15:38.274 --> 15:39.775
whether to hit driver or 3-wood.

15:39.776 --> 15:41.485
That's obviously still
in the back of his mind.

15:41.486 --> 15:43.153
And once you've made
one mistake out of the water...

15:43.154 --> 15:46.532
I had a feeling there was more
going on than meets the eye.

15:47.367 --> 15:49.576
Wow. He chilled good.

15:49.577 --> 15:51.370
[NOBILO]:... what could I have done
differently instead.

15:51.371 --> 15:53.664
Just hitting never
gets you out of trouble.

15:53.665 --> 15:55.165
[LEWIS]: The problem is,
his ball remains...

15:55.166 --> 15:58.127
What do I got to do to get
some food around here,

15:58.920 --> 16:00.337
kill a cow myself?

16:00.338 --> 16:02.672
[NOBILO]: So really, this is farcical.
You've got no chance...

16:32.326 --> 16:33.994
Wow.

16:33.995 --> 16:36.079
That's no greenskeeper.

16:46.799 --> 16:50.927
"PGA of America Half Century Club".

17:05.692 --> 17:06.733
[door creaks open]

17:06.734 --> 17:09.361
Hey, Luke,
I was hoping you'd be here.

17:09.362 --> 17:10.654
You can tote these.

17:11.615 --> 17:14.116
Well, close your mouth, sugar.
Let's go.

17:14.742 --> 17:17.161
Well, where we going?

17:17.162 --> 17:19.246
[upbeat country music playing]

17:28.173 --> 17:30.298
Hey, you're looking a whole lot better.

17:30.299 --> 17:31.758
I'm feeling better.

17:31.759 --> 17:33.509
You're in good hands with Mabel.

17:33.510 --> 17:35.386
Well, I'll tell you what.
I'll feed you right,

17:35.387 --> 17:37.805
but it's my brother Johnny
that you're gonna get the most from

17:37.806 --> 17:39.140
if you pay attention.

17:39.141 --> 17:41.643
Now where is my dance partner?

17:42.478 --> 17:44.854
Sarah? Sarah?

17:49.068 --> 17:51.277
Maybe you could just
introduce Luke around.

17:51.278 --> 17:52.445
Oh, sure.

17:52.446 --> 17:54.322
Hey, you feeling any better?

17:54.323 --> 17:59.034
Oh, yeah. It's amazing what a shower
and some clean clothes will do.

18:06.167 --> 18:08.293
You good with this, Duane?

18:08.294 --> 18:09.544
Yeah, go on.

18:12.924 --> 18:15.884
Am I ever gonna get to see you
whisper to a horse?

18:16.719 --> 18:19.930
Well, I don't do that just
in front of anybody, you know.

18:19.931 --> 18:21.431
What about dancing?

18:22.892 --> 18:25.269
You do that in front of anyone?

18:25.270 --> 18:28.062
Hey, lookee here. It's Tour boy.

18:28.063 --> 18:30.481
Jake Rustin, this is Luke Chisolm.

18:30.482 --> 18:33.484
Yeah, we had the pleasure
earlier today at the diner.

18:33.485 --> 18:34.860
Yeah, that was right before

18:34.861 --> 18:36.737
I helped drag your car
out of a cow patty.

18:36.738 --> 18:38.906
Wasn't too happy about it
at the time.

18:39.283 --> 18:41.909
Then me and Sarah saw you
on TV, remember?

18:42.411 --> 18:44.412
Hey, you're a regular celebrity.

18:44.413 --> 18:46.372
Not every day I get to help out
a record holder.

18:46.373 --> 18:47.540
Hey, Jake, be quiet.

18:47.541 --> 18:51.627
Well, I had quite the meltdown.

18:51.628 --> 18:54.922
Oh, yeah. I especially
liked that mud bath.

18:54.923 --> 18:57.632
The Golf Channel,
they don't miss a thing.

18:57.633 --> 18:58.800
Jake.

18:58.801 --> 19:00.218
It's okay.

19:00.219 --> 19:01.845
Just let him talk.

19:01.846 --> 19:04.472
I'm sure he could
have done a lot better.

19:04.473 --> 19:06.182
You play golf?

19:06.183 --> 19:08.059
I could hold my own.

19:08.060 --> 19:09.853
Yeah? On what course?

19:09.854 --> 19:13.189
The kind with windmills, volcanoes...

19:13.190 --> 19:14.190
- Come on, guys.
- pirates?

19:14.191 --> 19:17.485
All right, can we be social?
Let's play nice.

19:18.904 --> 19:21.948
I never shot a 16
on one hole before.

19:21.949 --> 19:23.992
Yeah, well, it was a 14.

19:24.243 --> 19:26.118
Sarah, it was a pleasure.

19:28.830 --> 19:30.247
You wanna dance?

19:33.293 --> 19:38.297
¶ Leave it all behind ¶

19:44.804 --> 19:46.847
I didn't see where it went.

19:46.848 --> 19:48.474
You hooked it.

19:48.475 --> 19:50.059
You gotta watch your right hand.

19:50.060 --> 19:51.685
Let it release.

19:51.686 --> 19:53.228
Don't flip it.

19:53.229 --> 19:56.147
Dad, it's getting dark.

19:56.148 --> 19:58.149
Well, I can see just fine.

19:58.150 --> 20:00.651
Come on, now. Let's finish
what we started here.

20:01.820 --> 20:04.655
[sighs]

20:04.656 --> 20:07.158
One more good one.

20:13.123 --> 20:14.165
Come on, now.

20:19.171 --> 20:20.171
[thunder rumbles]

20:21.632 --> 20:24.049
[JOHNNY]: There you are.

20:24.050 --> 20:25.467
Hey.

20:30.765 --> 20:33.100
Tough day, eh?

20:33.101 --> 20:35.310
Yeah. Heh, I've had better.

20:35.311 --> 20:37.229
Yeah, well...

20:37.230 --> 20:38.939
I saw you on TV.

20:38.940 --> 20:43.360
I got to say
it was painful to watch.

20:43.361 --> 20:45.153
Try living it.

20:45.154 --> 20:47.322
Believe it or not, I have.

20:48.074 --> 20:49.241
I believe it.

20:50.410 --> 20:52.327
I snooped around
in your study.

20:52.328 --> 20:56.455
Yeah?
Well, I chased the Tour for a while.

20:56.456 --> 20:58.666
Had my ups and downs.

20:58.667 --> 21:00.668
You want an observation?

21:02.963 --> 21:05.214
You were playing from back here, see?

21:05.215 --> 21:07.091
Tournament golf has to be
played in front of you

21:07.092 --> 21:09.802
where the target is.

21:09.803 --> 21:12.179
That's a new one.

21:12.180 --> 21:13.681
You have the mechanics.

21:14.141 --> 21:19.186
You just don't know what it means
to play the game in front of the ball.

21:20.522 --> 21:23.440
Well, I'm debating on picking up
a club ever again.

21:24.233 --> 21:27.735
Well, I have a proposition for you.

21:27.736 --> 21:31.281
Spend seven days with me in Utopia,

21:31.282 --> 21:33.283
you'll find your game.

21:37.621 --> 21:40.498
Seven days? I don't know.

21:40.499 --> 21:45.503
Well, it'll take you that long
to get your car fixed, you know?

21:46.255 --> 21:48.089
So think about it, all right?

21:49.758 --> 21:53.135
I'll be at the driving range 9 am.
tomorrow morning.

21:53.136 --> 21:54.678
Sarah.

21:54.679 --> 21:56.472
Hey, Johnny.

21:57.557 --> 21:59.266
[SARAH]: I thought
you could use some company.

21:59.976 --> 22:02.060
Gonna be fireworks soon.

22:02.061 --> 22:03.729
All right.

22:04.564 --> 22:08.275
I also wanted to apologize...
for Jake.

22:09.027 --> 22:10.486
His dad basically
disowned him...

22:10.487 --> 22:12.446
after he chose the rodeo
over the family business.

22:12.447 --> 22:15.407
But he's got a warm heart,
that's for sure.

22:16.201 --> 22:17.117
I see.

22:17.410 --> 22:19.578
[clears throat]
You two together?

22:20.412 --> 22:23.039
No. Everyone expects us to be, but...

22:24.041 --> 22:26.459
I don't know, especially Jake.

22:26.460 --> 22:28.878
[laughs] So...

22:28.879 --> 22:31.005
well, what about you?

22:31.006 --> 22:32.423
Me.

22:34.218 --> 22:38.221
Mom and I lost my dad to cancer
two years ago,

22:38.222 --> 22:41.891
so I suppose I'm just...

22:41.892 --> 22:44.477
taking each day as they come.

22:48.482 --> 22:49.940
I'm sorry.

22:51.692 --> 22:56.821
"I suppose" means God works
in mysterious ways.

23:01.786 --> 23:04.120
Well, Johnny says he can
help me with my game.

23:04.121 --> 23:07.332
Think I should take him up
on his offer?

23:07.333 --> 23:09.626
[fireworks explode]

23:13.214 --> 23:14.881
Well, I think...

23:16.175 --> 23:19.760
I think some time here
might do you good.

23:20.679 --> 23:22.972
[fireworks whistle and explode]

23:50.916 --> 23:53.251
"Donations appreciated.
God bless".

23:54.253 --> 23:56.004
Nice.

24:03.804 --> 24:05.805
[golf ball bouncing]

24:16.983 --> 24:18.025
[horse snuffles]

24:18.026 --> 24:19.526
You got game, son.

24:21.821 --> 24:23.780
You could have told me
you owned this place.

24:23.781 --> 24:27.409
Well, you could have told me
what really happened to your putter.

24:30.538 --> 24:32.706
What made you want to build
a golf course out here?

24:33.291 --> 24:36.543
Well, originally I moved here
to get away from the game,

24:36.544 --> 24:38.545
but easier said than done, I guess.

24:39.339 --> 24:41.131
So you quit the Tour?

24:41.132 --> 24:46.302
Well, the game just wasn't
a good fit for me anymore. Yeah.

24:46.303 --> 24:48.095
Okay, listen, let's...
let's get started.

24:48.096 --> 24:49.680
I want to see you hit some,
all right?

24:50.265 --> 24:51.557
I want to see you swing.

24:54.645 --> 24:57.313
- Yeah, these are a litle better.
- Yep.

25:12.329 --> 25:13.995
Why do you grip the club that way?

25:15.373 --> 25:16.539
Well, I don't know.

25:16.540 --> 25:18.083
Just feels good.

25:18.084 --> 25:19.417
Well, that's the wrong answer.

25:20.670 --> 25:23.755
Now, let start from scratch, all right?

25:24.799 --> 25:27.676
I need to know why you do
the things you do.

25:27.677 --> 25:30.720
Like the foundation for your swing,

25:30.721 --> 25:33.223
from the grip to the follow-through.

25:34.058 --> 25:37.310
Now go think about it and write it down.

25:37.311 --> 25:40.730
The first step in finding a good game

25:40.731 --> 25:43.023
is to find some conviction.

25:44.567 --> 25:45.943
You got that?

25:45.944 --> 25:47.695
Think about it.

25:51.908 --> 25:53.492
How'd I end up here?

25:59.916 --> 26:02.000
[goat bleats]

26:05.463 --> 26:06.964
Unbelievable.

26:30.279 --> 26:32.488
[cheering crowd]

26:50.590 --> 26:53.592
[projector running]

27:09.025 --> 27:11.692
The toughest challenge you'll face
isn't the golf course

27:11.693 --> 27:13.110
or even your competitor's score.

27:13.111 --> 27:17.239
It's that casual comment
offered by someone, anyone,

27:17.240 --> 27:19.700
about how you should be doing it.

27:19.701 --> 27:22.495
If you don't have conviction
about where your foundation is,

27:22.496 --> 27:25.623
that off-handed comment
will take you out of your game

27:25.624 --> 27:29.126
and erode your confidence.

27:29.127 --> 27:30.795
Now, you got that?

27:30.796 --> 27:32.379
Yes, sir.

27:36.343 --> 27:38.135
That's Ben Hogan.

27:38.136 --> 27:39.177
Yeah.

27:39.178 --> 27:40.887
The one and only.

27:53.108 --> 27:56.110
Place the club in my left hand

27:56.111 --> 27:58.738
with my thumb down the shaft.

27:58.739 --> 28:01.741
Place my right hand over my left thumb,

28:01.742 --> 28:03.618
my lifeline.

28:03.619 --> 28:07.914
That helps me cock my wrist
in my backswing.

28:08.289 --> 28:10.040
That's good.

28:10.750 --> 28:13.544
[exhales] And do it with ease.

28:17.715 --> 28:19.091
[LUKE]:
You're not from here, are you?

28:20.510 --> 28:24.721
Well, not exactly.
I've lived in a lot of places.

28:24.722 --> 28:27.766
Been around here and there
with the military.

28:27.767 --> 28:31.436
No, I'm not from here.

28:31.437 --> 28:34.189
How'd you end up in Utopia?

28:34.190 --> 28:37.191
[chuckles]

28:37.192 --> 28:40.152
You ask a lot of questions,
young fella.

28:40.153 --> 28:43.072
You really do.

28:43.073 --> 28:45.241
I burned all my bridges.

28:45.242 --> 28:49.161
There was no place to turn but here.

28:51.999 --> 28:54.584
A Tour player like you,

28:54.585 --> 28:57.962
the players you played with,

28:57.963 --> 28:59.881
why here?

28:59.882 --> 29:01.507
I'll tell you.

29:01.508 --> 29:04.719
Paul Hawkins was a student of mine
way back when.

29:04.720 --> 29:05.928
That's Sarah's dad.

29:05.929 --> 29:08.138
He was a good man...
a great man.

29:08.139 --> 29:11.308
He let me stay with them
while I...

29:13.227 --> 29:14.519
got my act together.

29:17.523 --> 29:19.524
Been here ever since.

29:25.740 --> 29:28.116
Did you get in some kind of trouble?

29:28.117 --> 29:29.910
[Johnny sighs]

29:29.911 --> 29:31.411
It's getting late.

29:33.039 --> 29:35.456
I'm gonna see you tomorrow
down by the river.

29:35.457 --> 29:37.207
Daybreak, all right?

29:37.918 --> 29:39.877
What does the river
have to do with golf?

29:39.878 --> 29:41.879
You'll see.

29:43.423 --> 29:45.424
You will see.

30:01.691 --> 30:04.817
[JOHNNY]:
Rhythm, balance, patience.

30:04.818 --> 30:07.236
That's what you need
to stay in your game.

30:08.238 --> 30:09.405
The same with fly fishing.

30:09.406 --> 30:10.448
[fishing line whoosh]

30:10.449 --> 30:12.408
It takes a calm mindset...

30:12.409 --> 30:16.621
a focus on the feel,
rather than the outcome.

30:16.622 --> 30:19.499
It takes emotional control.

30:21.961 --> 30:23.378
[splashing]

30:46.567 --> 30:47.693
Hey?

30:49.070 --> 30:50.487
All right.

30:53.616 --> 30:54.825
[JOHNNY]: All right.
[coughs]

30:55.118 --> 30:57.369
Now, tell me.

30:57.370 --> 30:59.037
What was his downfall?

31:00.248 --> 31:01.999
Well, he...
he took the bait.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.709
Yeah, but why?
What made him fall into that trap?

31:06.044 --> 31:07.586
I'm not sure.

31:07.587 --> 31:08.963
'Cause he was hungry?

31:08.964 --> 31:10.881
No, he was mad.

31:11.883 --> 31:13.592
I teased him with a shadow casting,

31:13.593 --> 31:16.804
never quite letting the fly
touch the water,

31:16.805 --> 31:20.683
so I was able to take that fish
out of his game today.

31:22.227 --> 31:25.146
Now, you ready to give it a try?

31:44.999 --> 31:46.624
All right, remember.

31:46.625 --> 31:49.085
To stay in balance in the skiff

31:49.086 --> 31:51.963
or during your golf swing,

31:51.964 --> 31:54.632
you have to control your emotions.

31:54.633 --> 31:55.967
Okay?

31:55.968 --> 31:57.761
Uh-huh.

32:00.722 --> 32:02.056
[splashing]

32:03.141 --> 32:06.060
[exhales]
Breathe, Luke.

32:06.728 --> 32:10.606
Rhythm, balance, and patience.

32:14.110 --> 32:16.361
[whoosh, line releases]

32:29.167 --> 32:31.000
Johnny, I got one.

32:33.796 --> 32:36.464
[JOHNNY]: Now catch it.
Keep the tip up.

32:36.465 --> 32:39.717
Keep the tip up.
Take it as it comes.

32:39.718 --> 32:40.551
All right?

32:48.060 --> 32:50.144
Easy. Easy.

32:52.689 --> 32:54.273
Oh!

32:57.569 --> 32:58.819
Never fails.

33:11.958 --> 33:13.416
[laughs]

33:17.672 --> 33:19.172
Got him, Johnny.

33:19.173 --> 33:22.092
Hey-hey-hey! Good job, son.

33:22.093 --> 33:23.009
Whoo!

33:23.010 --> 33:25.220
How come you always seem
to do things the hard way?

33:25.221 --> 33:27.222
[Luke laughs]

33:27.223 --> 33:29.723
- Good.
- Hey!

33:37.315 --> 33:38.190
[door opens]

33:38.191 --> 33:39.733
[JOHNNY]: Come here.
I want to show you something.

33:42.154 --> 33:44.029
30 years ago, this man
named Jack Nicklaus...

33:44.030 --> 33:45.489
took me out of my game.

33:45.490 --> 33:46.574
You know how?

33:46.575 --> 33:48.492
By staying in his game.

33:48.493 --> 33:51.412
The calmer he was,
the madder I got.

33:51.413 --> 33:56.000
And I tried shots
I wouldn't ordinarily take.

33:56.001 --> 33:59.294
Now, this look familiar?

34:04.133 --> 34:06.426
A little hiccup on 18.

34:08.179 --> 34:12.181
Well, at least you got beat
by the golden bear.

34:12.183 --> 34:15.685
Yeah, and so would you have.
Ha ha ha.

34:18.313 --> 34:19.981
Now tomorrow we actually meet
at the course.

34:19.982 --> 34:22.442
Fifth fairway.

34:22.443 --> 34:24.277
8 A.M.

34:24.277 --> 34:26.320
[rooster crows]

34:43.213 --> 34:44.880
I'm sorry.

34:44.880 --> 34:46.882
It's not good to be late in life, son.

34:46.882 --> 34:50.260
Time is too precious to waste.

34:50.261 --> 34:51.844
I said I was sorry.

34:51.846 --> 34:54.056
If this was a tournament,
you'd be disqualified.

34:54.056 --> 34:55.431
Now, you wanna play
like a professional,

34:55.431 --> 34:59.185
you have to act like one, all right?
Now take a seat.

35:00.187 --> 35:02.396
Take a seat.

35:06.693 --> 35:08.736
Today...

35:10.155 --> 35:13.032
we're gonna paint. All right?

35:14.868 --> 35:15.993
Paint?

35:16.703 --> 35:17.870
All right.

35:18.622 --> 35:21.540
All golf shots start with a blank canvas.

35:23.043 --> 35:25.460
We paint the shot with our eyes first...

35:26.879 --> 35:29.589
so our bodies can reproduce it accurately.

35:31.467 --> 35:32.467
Now...

35:35.388 --> 35:37.806
what kind of shot

35:37.807 --> 35:39.140
could you make from here?

35:48.234 --> 35:50.485
- Well, I think...
- No, no, no. Don't think.

35:50.486 --> 35:52.528
See.

36:02.706 --> 36:04.581
Okay.

36:04.582 --> 36:06.834
I see a low punch eight iron.

36:06.835 --> 36:08.919
Playing the ball back in my stance

36:08.920 --> 36:11.338
with a slightly hooded clubface.

36:11.339 --> 36:14.008
I can see the ball flying
about 30 yards...

36:14.009 --> 36:15.342
with some hook-spin,

36:15.343 --> 36:17.845
landing on the upslope of that hill,

36:17.846 --> 36:21.223
bouncing up and going in the cup.

36:23.892 --> 36:26.644
Okay. Now go paint it.

36:35.195 --> 36:38.156
- Morning.
- Morning.

36:41.035 --> 36:43.786
- Just paying a visit to Paul.
- Yeah.

36:43.787 --> 36:46.331
So hard. Mmm...

36:46.332 --> 36:49.334
Hey, Mama, you gonna be all right?
Just give me a minute?

36:49.335 --> 36:52.294
- Right, honey. You go have fun.
- Take care.

36:52.295 --> 36:54.254
Can't believe it's been two years.

36:54.255 --> 36:55.881
Yeah.

36:55.882 --> 36:58.467
I miss Paul most every day.

36:58.468 --> 37:00.052
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

37:00.053 --> 37:02.888
Whoa-ho-ho.
Yeah. Whoa-ho-ho.

37:02.889 --> 37:05.098
- [laughing through tears]
- Ohh. Ah.

37:05.808 --> 37:07.642
- Hi.
- Hey.

37:08.978 --> 37:10.437
[LUKE]: You look nice.

37:10.438 --> 37:11.355
Well, thank you.

37:12.440 --> 37:15.567
So your Uncle Johnny,
he's a real piece of work today.

37:17.570 --> 37:20.363
Yeah, well, it's actually kind of
a rough day for all of us.

37:21.698 --> 37:23.949
It's the second anniversary
of Dad's passing.

37:26.370 --> 37:28.954
- Oh.
- It's okay.

37:30.874 --> 37:32.333
Is there anything I can do?

37:33.251 --> 37:35.795
Well, I was gonna ask you...

37:35.796 --> 37:39.298
My father and I used to go up
to Obra Maestra on his birthday.

37:39.299 --> 37:41.634
I was thinking
of going out there later today,

37:41.635 --> 37:43.511
and I could really use the company.

37:46.181 --> 37:47.306
It'd be an honor.

37:48.600 --> 37:49.641
Okay.

37:51.977 --> 37:54.145
I see Uncle Johnny's
got you painting already.

37:55.564 --> 37:57.607
Yeah, he does.
I wasn't expecting that.

37:57.608 --> 37:58.775
[Sarah laughs]

38:54.371 --> 38:55.746
[trophy thuds on shelf]

38:55.747 --> 38:58.040
Looks like we're gonna have
to add another shelf.

38:59.126 --> 39:01.711
Maybe one day there'll be
Tour trophies on that shelf.

39:03.088 --> 39:04.755
Ain't no maybes in this world, Luke.

39:06.425 --> 39:07.300
You understand?

39:08.677 --> 39:10.595
Yes, Dad.

39:10.596 --> 39:11.554
Good.

39:12.473 --> 39:14.682
Now rephrase what you just said to me.

39:17.310 --> 39:20.103
Well, one day there will be
Tour trophies on this shelf.

39:21.647 --> 39:23.482
[slaps Luke's shoulder]
I'm counting on it, son.

39:25.026 --> 39:26.234
I'm proud of you.

40:00.143 --> 40:02.394
[horse approaches, snuffling]

40:19.703 --> 40:21.412
You ready, cowboy?

40:21.413 --> 40:23.289
[chuckles]

40:44.727 --> 40:48.605
Obra maestra means
masterpiece in Spanish.

40:48.606 --> 40:52.734
I can see why.

40:52.735 --> 40:55.070
Sure is beautiful.

41:00.827 --> 41:03.203
Might even go as far as call it Utopia.

41:05.707 --> 41:08.834
Yeah. I suppose you might.

41:10.169 --> 41:12.461
You ever think of living somewhere else?

41:12.462 --> 41:15.256
Well, everything I need's right here.

41:15.257 --> 41:17.425
I'm free to be myself.

41:18.302 --> 41:20.386
Free to do the things I was born to do.

41:22.389 --> 41:24.098
What is that?

41:26.518 --> 41:28.686
Bring freedom to horses.

41:30.564 --> 41:33.733
[laughs to herself] And, uh,

41:33.734 --> 41:36.110
the occasional stranger.

41:47.121 --> 41:49.414
[JAKE]: Come on.

41:50.041 --> 41:51.791
[horse whinnies]

41:52.877 --> 41:54.586
Hyah, hyah! Move!

41:54.587 --> 41:56.296
[Jake's horse whinnies]

41:56.297 --> 41:57.380
Jake.

41:58.633 --> 41:59.883
- [horses' whinnies increase]
- Jake, you're coming too close.

41:59.884 --> 42:01.259
You're gonna scare the horses.

42:02.178 --> 42:03.094
Come on! Come on!

42:04.972 --> 42:06.139
Whoa.

42:06.682 --> 42:08.266
What are you doing out here with him?

42:08.267 --> 42:09.601
I'm taking a ride.

42:09.602 --> 42:11.310
I didn't know
I needed your permission.

42:11.311 --> 42:15.439
So, Tour boy,
choke on anything lately?

42:17.275 --> 42:20.486
Yeah, well, at least I got a sport
to choke on.

42:20.487 --> 42:22.321
And what do y'all play out here,
mutton busting?

42:23.323 --> 42:26.367
You know what us Tour boys say
about hicks and sheep, don't you?

42:26.368 --> 42:28.202
That's real funny.

42:28.203 --> 42:29.203
I don't know who you think...

42:29.204 --> 42:30.287
- you're talking to.
- Boys.

42:30.288 --> 42:31.413
Hey, quit it!

42:31.414 --> 42:32.665
Now, you're acting
like a couple of children.

42:32.666 --> 42:33.874
Jake! Chuck, get him off!

42:33.875 --> 42:35.376
You heard the lady.

42:35.377 --> 42:37.336
Get off me!

42:39.546 --> 42:41.798
Now, how about you two hotheads

42:41.799 --> 42:46.177
settle this over a friendly little game
of cowboy poker after the rodeo tonight?

42:47.638 --> 42:48.471
[horse whinnies]

43:00.234 --> 43:01.109
[MAN]: Whoo!

43:01.110 --> 43:02.151
[ANNOUNCER]:
Ladies and gentlemen,

43:02.152 --> 43:03.736
this is the final event of the evening.

43:03.737 --> 43:07.615
Hold onto your seats.
It's time for cowboy poker.

43:07.616 --> 43:08.907
Introducing our players:

43:08.908 --> 43:14.079
Duane "Slim" Pickens and Chuck Baer
as the usual suspects.

43:14.080 --> 43:18.083
Four-time Utopia Rodeo champion
Jake Rustin.

43:18.084 --> 43:20.627
And our final player, he's a first-timer,

43:20.628 --> 43:22.754
so let's give a warm Utopia welcome

43:22.755 --> 43:26.341
for professional golfer Luke Chisolm.

43:26.342 --> 43:29.720
All right, boys, deal the cards
and let's get this party started.

43:31.889 --> 43:34.141
Time to put up or shut up.

43:35.017 --> 43:36.518
All right.
What are we playing?

43:36.519 --> 43:37.727
Texas Hold 'em.

43:37.728 --> 43:39.061
Oh, yeah, but there's a catch.

43:40.188 --> 43:42.106
You got to hold on to your chair.

43:42.858 --> 43:43.733
Why?

43:43.734 --> 43:45.359
You'll see.

43:45.360 --> 43:47.778
The last man still in their seat
in the end wins 200 bucks!

43:47.779 --> 43:50.072
[cowbell clangs]

44:00.584 --> 44:02.251
[ANNOUNCER]: Watch out.
He's got his sights set...

44:02.252 --> 44:03.586
on the usual suspects.

44:03.587 --> 44:05.463
[bull bellows]

44:05.464 --> 44:06.880
Chuck's all in.

44:08.132 --> 44:09.632
[MAN]: Go get him, Cannonball.

44:12.428 --> 44:15.221
[ANNOUNCER]: Who's Cannonball
gonna go for next?

44:15.222 --> 44:16.389
[MAN]: Watch out, Slim!

44:16.390 --> 44:17.974
Keep your butt in the chair.

44:20.853 --> 44:22.312
Aa-aa-ahh! Whah!

44:24.315 --> 44:27.066
[JAKE]: It's you and me.
Let's see what you got.

44:28.611 --> 44:30.111
Boys.

44:31.113 --> 44:32.322
[MAN]: Atta boy, Jake!

44:33.532 --> 44:35.949
Whoa!

44:40.914 --> 44:44.333
[ANNOUNCER]:
And the winner is the rookie!

44:52.300 --> 44:53.675
Dang it!

44:56.471 --> 44:57.596
Yeah!

45:08.273 --> 45:09.524
[cheers and applause]

45:09.525 --> 45:11.526
Proud of you, son.

45:15.823 --> 45:18.241
Hey, Luke, Luke,
what's next for you?

45:18.242 --> 45:19.826
Is it time to go pro?

45:19.827 --> 45:21.035
Um...

45:21.036 --> 45:24.372
Well, this hasn't even sunk in yet,

45:24.373 --> 45:28.751
so I'm just gonna try to enjoy
this feeling and, uh...

45:28.752 --> 45:30.086
He's a humble kid.

45:30.087 --> 45:33.839
Uh, what he means to say is yes.
He will be turning pro.

45:33.840 --> 45:34.965
Of course he'll be turning pro,

45:34.966 --> 45:38.093
and we'll begin to look for
a sponsor's exemption immediately.

45:38.094 --> 45:39.553
[MAN]: Whoo! All right!

45:41.848 --> 45:43.932
- Yeah!
- Good going, Luke!

45:49.272 --> 45:51.189
[laughing]

45:55.820 --> 45:57.445
[still laughing]

45:57.446 --> 45:58.655
I'm sorry.

45:58.656 --> 46:00.866
Yeah, I know. Laugh it up.

46:00.867 --> 46:03.868
Hey, speaking of manure,
where'd the rhinestone cowboy go?

46:03.869 --> 46:05.327
I was ready to gloat.

46:05.328 --> 46:08.372
[laughs] Well, Jake went off in a huff.

46:08.373 --> 46:10.416
He doesn't like to lose.

46:10.417 --> 46:13.002
Well, that makes two of us.

46:13.003 --> 46:16.171
Hm.. Well, there's more to life
than winning, right?

46:16.172 --> 46:17.590
Like what?

46:19.426 --> 46:22.011
Family. Friendship.

46:22.012 --> 46:23.679
Faith. Love.

46:25.348 --> 46:26.724
Oh, yeah.

46:26.725 --> 46:28.726
I guess those, too.

46:33.647 --> 46:35.607
All right, Johnny's got
the horses hitched up.

46:35.608 --> 46:36.691
It's time to go.

46:39.236 --> 46:40.695
You know, cowboy?

46:40.696 --> 46:44.157
Sometimes I think you might
just be hopeless.

46:49.163 --> 46:50.038
Hey, Luke.

46:51.957 --> 46:53.166
Get in here, smelly.

46:53.167 --> 46:55.043
Come on in here.

46:55.836 --> 46:57.503
I hung up your masterpiece.

46:57.504 --> 46:59.047
You forgot to sign it.

47:02.050 --> 47:03.550
[Johnny laughs]

47:06.054 --> 47:07.638
What's this?

47:07.639 --> 47:09.222
Oh, that?

47:09.223 --> 47:11.058
Oh, that bottle's my greatest trophy.

47:12.352 --> 47:14.561
No, let me explain.

47:14.562 --> 47:18.732
It's the last liquor I ever drank.

47:28.576 --> 47:30.117
Doesn't it tempt you?

47:30.118 --> 47:32.244
No, just the opposite.

47:32.245 --> 47:35.247
Makes me remember
all the things I lost

47:35.248 --> 47:39.001
because, uh, I drank too much.

47:39.002 --> 47:40.211
That's why I put it there.

47:41.797 --> 47:43.631
Is that why you quit the Tour?

47:45.008 --> 47:48.219
Well, more or less, yes.

47:48.220 --> 47:51.389
More or less, yeah.

47:51.390 --> 47:55.601
[exhales]
Pretty hard to drink and drive, eh?

47:55.602 --> 47:56.686
[chuckles]

47:57.938 --> 47:59.854
Yeah.

48:01.816 --> 48:04.234
Well, I'm sorry about this morning,
being late and all.

48:04.235 --> 48:05.860
No, no, I'm not. I am not.

48:05.861 --> 48:08.780
Learn how to paint your shot,
you learn how to be on time.

48:08.781 --> 48:10.907
A professional golfer does both.

48:10.908 --> 48:15.036
Now, sign your masterpiece,
Picasso.

48:28.133 --> 48:29.842
[LUKE]:
Where we headed, anyway?

48:30.844 --> 48:32.720
[JOHNNY]:
Gonna work on your putting.

48:32.721 --> 48:34.680
Well, the golf course
is back that way.

48:34.681 --> 48:37.683
Uh-huh. Yeah, it is.

48:43.857 --> 48:46.608
I thought you said we was
gonna work on some putting.

48:46.609 --> 48:48.986
That's right. That's right.

48:48.987 --> 48:52.156
We are.
Come on.

48:54.367 --> 48:58.411
I hope you brought some of your
winnings from last night.

48:58.412 --> 49:01.748
[playing slow country blues]

49:04.293 --> 49:06.419
Well played, gentlemen.
Well played.

49:06.420 --> 49:08.046
Hear, hear.
Keep practicing.

49:08.047 --> 49:10.548
Well, look who he dragged
in here with him.

49:10.549 --> 49:11.716
You a little stiff this morning?

49:11.717 --> 49:14.052
Still sore I beat you last night.

49:14.053 --> 49:14.927
You better watch it.

49:14.928 --> 49:16.054
[JOHNNY]: Enough of that, Jake,
knock it off.

49:16.055 --> 49:17.013
Hey, Jake, come on, come on.

49:17.014 --> 49:18.431
Get the washers, all right?

49:18.432 --> 49:21.267
Let's get the game started here.
Come on.

49:21.268 --> 49:22.852
Same old Jake. Come on.

49:25.147 --> 49:27.439
Okay. Now, the rules are simple.

49:27.440 --> 49:30.776
The man who's up pitches
from behind the marker of his choice.

49:30.777 --> 49:32.861
Yeah, but I don't see
what this has to do with golf.

49:32.862 --> 49:34.696
You just watch. Just watch.

49:34.697 --> 49:36.156
Just watch. See?

49:37.658 --> 49:40.077
Ooh! You owe me five bucks, boys.

49:40.078 --> 49:42.245
You ready to give it a try?

49:42.246 --> 49:43.622
Yeah, sure.

49:43.623 --> 49:45.874
Come on.
Don't make me look bad, now.

49:45.875 --> 49:48.668
All right, it's on, boys.

49:48.669 --> 49:52.130
There's not a chance
he'll make this.

49:52.131 --> 49:54.049
You gonna put your money
where your mouth is?

49:54.050 --> 49:55.841
- Ooh.
- You're on.

49:55.842 --> 49:57.093
It's a bet, Jake.

50:00.472 --> 50:02.223
Ho-ho!

50:02.224 --> 50:04.517
- Beginner's luck.
- Whoo!

50:04.518 --> 50:06.852
Here. Let's see you do that again.

50:06.853 --> 50:09.647
All right. All right.

50:09.648 --> 50:11.273
[MAN]: ¶ Everybody ¶

50:12.275 --> 50:14.401
¶ Needs a woman's love, now ¶

50:14.402 --> 50:16.529
[clank]
- Yes!

50:16.530 --> 50:18.531
I like this game.

50:18.532 --> 50:19.782
[upbeat music]

50:19.783 --> 50:21.367
Crazy, cowboy.

50:21.368 --> 50:23.660
Hey, knock it in, man.

50:23.661 --> 50:25.411
Oh!

50:25.412 --> 50:27.080
¶ I'm gonna move ¶

50:27.081 --> 50:28.998
¶ I got to work it on out ¶

50:28.999 --> 50:30.583
He's better than you!

50:30.584 --> 50:32.585
¶ Early in the mornin' ¶

50:32.586 --> 50:34.921
¶ I play a few more now ¶

50:34.922 --> 50:38.466
¶ Well, bend it on out ¶

50:38.467 --> 50:39.968
Whoo!

50:39.969 --> 50:41.970
Yeah! Yeah!

50:43.639 --> 50:45.515
Come on.

50:45.516 --> 50:46.641
- Come on.
- Whoo-hoo!

50:46.642 --> 50:47.892
Let's go.

50:47.893 --> 50:49.394
Ooh.

50:49.395 --> 50:51.437
- We're even.
- We're even.

50:52.398 --> 50:53.772
Come on, Slim!

50:53.773 --> 50:55.983
¶ I like it like that ¶
- Oh, come on!

50:55.984 --> 50:58.694
¶ Everybody ¶
- That's the one! Play it.

50:58.695 --> 50:59.778
¶ Needs somebody ¶

50:59.779 --> 51:01.113
Yeah!

51:01.114 --> 51:03.532
¶ Everybody ¶
- Ohh-ho.

51:03.533 --> 51:05.409
- I'm impressed.
¶ Needs a little love now ¶

51:05.410 --> 51:06.410
¶ Oh, mercy ¶

51:06.411 --> 51:08.036
Make me proud, son.

51:08.037 --> 51:08.954
You make me proud.

51:08.955 --> 51:11.623
Watch his form.

51:11.624 --> 51:13.458
Right off the fingers.

51:13.459 --> 51:15.377
I'm the rodeo king!

51:15.378 --> 51:16.628
You know what I love
about the cowboy way?

51:16.629 --> 51:19.047
Everything! Hey!

51:20.425 --> 51:22.758
Whoo!

51:22.759 --> 51:24.760
Okay, boys. Let's go. Let's go.

51:24.761 --> 51:26.512
We're going to the links now.

51:26.513 --> 51:27.889
We're gonna do some putting.
Let's go.

51:27.890 --> 51:29.348
Come on.

51:29.349 --> 51:30.975
[boys chatter and laugh]

51:30.976 --> 51:31.893
Come on.

51:33.478 --> 51:36.355
Pitching washers...

51:36.356 --> 51:39.859
give me an idea
for a putting technique.

51:39.860 --> 51:40.860
You're kidding, right?

51:40.861 --> 51:41.944
No, no, sir.

51:41.945 --> 51:43.487
I have a respect for tradition,

51:43.488 --> 51:46.490
but I have a passion
for the truth, okay?

51:46.491 --> 51:48.784
Now, here.

51:49.828 --> 51:51.077
- Jake?
- Yes, sir.

51:51.078 --> 51:53.079
Use the face-on putter.

51:53.080 --> 51:55.457
You use the traditional one.

51:56.626 --> 51:57.959
5 to 1 on Jake.

51:57.960 --> 52:00.212
Quiet in the peanut gallery here.

52:00.213 --> 52:02.714
Come on, Jake. Help me out.

52:06.010 --> 52:09.512
Get in the hole.
Get in the hole!

52:09.513 --> 52:10.388
Yes!

52:10.389 --> 52:11.473
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

52:12.558 --> 52:14.935
- Here you go, Tour boy.
- It's gonna be a good day for me.

52:15.978 --> 52:18.063
Good. Good.

52:18.064 --> 52:19.481
You try.

52:21.358 --> 52:22.900
Come on, rookie.
Make me some money.

52:28.949 --> 52:30.407
[BOTH]: Oh!

52:30.408 --> 52:33.202
Ooh. Aah...

52:42.254 --> 52:43.462
This is fun.

52:48.134 --> 52:50.134
Miss it. Miss it.
No, no, no.

52:50.135 --> 52:51.344
Yes!

52:51.345 --> 52:52.679
[laughs]

52:53.639 --> 52:54.847
I'm impressed.

52:54.848 --> 52:56.641
You ready to give this one a try?

52:56.642 --> 52:58.518
- Sure.
- Here you go.

52:58.519 --> 53:00.436
When in Utopia, right?

53:02.064 --> 53:03.356
[DUANE]: Come on.
Let's go.

53:03.357 --> 53:05.191
More drinks for me tonight.
Let's go.

53:05.192 --> 53:06.401
[CHUCK]: Ain't no way.

53:06.402 --> 53:08.319
Come on, now.

53:10.364 --> 53:12.657
- This look right?
- Yeah.

53:15.744 --> 53:17.161
No way. No way.

53:17.162 --> 53:19.121
No way. No...
oh, yeah!

53:19.122 --> 53:21.164
All right, let me ask you something.

53:22.208 --> 53:25.544
Would you or could you
use this in competition?

53:26.838 --> 53:31.008
I'd probably get laughed off the course,
but it definitely works.

53:31.009 --> 53:33.885
Yeah. No, you keep it.

53:33.886 --> 53:36.263
'Cause when the time comes,

53:36.264 --> 53:38.140
you'll know when to use it.

53:38.891 --> 53:39.725
Okay.

53:41.394 --> 53:42.686
[LUKE]: You have any kids?

53:43.438 --> 53:44.730
No, sir.

53:46.566 --> 53:48.399
That's one of my biggest regrets.

53:50.777 --> 53:52.903
I saw your wedding photo.

53:53.947 --> 53:55.364
Oh, you snooping around again, are you?

53:55.365 --> 53:56.782
You snooping?

53:56.783 --> 53:59.910
You're a super snooper.
[laughs]

53:59.911 --> 54:01.579
- I'm sorry.
- You're a real snooper.

54:01.580 --> 54:05.207
Well, that's a cool study room.

54:05.208 --> 54:06.584
Pictures of all those legends.

54:06.585 --> 54:10.296
No. Annie, my Annie,

54:11.423 --> 54:13.466
couldn't have kids.

54:14.343 --> 54:17.218
She used to joke that she didn't
need any 'cause she had me.

54:18.721 --> 54:19.929
Yeah.

54:22.767 --> 54:26.561
Well, if you don't mind me asking,
what happened?

54:28.439 --> 54:31.399
Well, she's...
she's gone on.

54:32.401 --> 54:34.611
Couldn't put up with my drinking anymore.

54:35.279 --> 54:36.988
Can't say I blame her.

54:40.284 --> 54:41.701
Sorry to hear that.

54:41.702 --> 54:43.495
Yeah, well...

54:45.914 --> 54:48.415
gone but not forgotten.

54:48.416 --> 54:49.792
Yeah.

54:50.627 --> 54:52.127
As they say...

54:52.128 --> 54:55.756
[sighs] all part of God's plan.

54:55.757 --> 54:57.800
Yeah, I suppose.

55:00.261 --> 55:01.261
Good night.

55:02.430 --> 55:03.347
Night.

55:04.891 --> 55:06.141
See you in the morning.

55:06.142 --> 55:07.726
You bet.

55:11.356 --> 55:12.356
[LUKE]: Let me guess.

55:12.357 --> 55:14.857
This is where you drop me off
in the middle of nowhere...

55:14.858 --> 55:17.610
and expect me to get back home
with the clothes on my back...

55:17.611 --> 55:19.695
and two golf tees in my pocket.

55:19.696 --> 55:21.030
That'd be way too easy.

55:36.880 --> 55:38.881
- Wow.
- That's it.

55:38.882 --> 55:41.259
- Is this yours?
- Yes, she is.

55:41.885 --> 55:43.176
Yeah.

55:43.177 --> 55:45.303
Um...
You're not planning on...

55:45.304 --> 55:47.180
going up in this thing,
though, are you?

55:47.181 --> 55:50.725
Well, why not?
I mean, flying's a lot like golf.

55:50.726 --> 55:53.437
Shooo. Eh? Ah?

55:53.438 --> 55:56.523
No. You said fly fishing
was a lot like golf.

55:56.524 --> 55:57.774
- Did I say that?
- Yeah.

55:57.775 --> 56:00.110
All right, maybe I did.

56:00.111 --> 56:01.611
You ready?

56:01.612 --> 56:03.029
- No way.
- Why?

56:03.030 --> 56:05.282
I'm keeping my feet
on the ground today.

56:05.283 --> 56:06.283
Oh, yeah?

56:07.076 --> 56:09.744
- [LUKE]: Whoa. I don't know about this.
- [Johnny]. Let's turn back.

56:09.745 --> 56:12.079
[JOHNNY]: Your feet control direction
with the rudder.

56:12.080 --> 56:14.748
- The stick controls the wings and pitch.
- Okay.

56:14.749 --> 56:19.086
Now, to turn, you press one foot
and turn the wheel in that direction.

56:19.087 --> 56:19.962
[LUKE]:
Turn the wheel in the direction.

56:19.963 --> 56:22.506
- And to go up or down, push or pull.
- Push or pull, yeah.

56:22.507 --> 56:23.424
- Got it?
- Okay.

56:23.425 --> 56:26.177
[LUKE]: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

56:27.262 --> 56:28.345
- Okay.
- Okay.

56:28.346 --> 56:30.473
No hands, see? Like this.
You're doing good.

56:30.474 --> 56:33.017
[LUKE]: All right. I'm getting it now.
I'm getting it. I think I'm getting it.

56:33.018 --> 56:35.269
[JOHNNY]: It's like riding a horse.
Keep her steady.

56:35.270 --> 56:38.230
- [beeping]
- Uh-oh. Ooh-ooh-ooh...

56:38.231 --> 56:39.356
What's...
Wait, wait, wait.

56:39.357 --> 56:41.900
What just happened?
What... Johnny?

56:41.901 --> 56:43.693
- Hold on. Hold on.
- What happened?

56:43.694 --> 56:45.653
[JOHNNY]: We have an emergency.
We have an emergency.

56:45.654 --> 56:46.863
- [LUKE]: Whoa!
- Put the plane down.

56:46.864 --> 56:48.448
Johnny, you take it. Take it.

56:48.449 --> 56:52.076
You take control of this aircraft, son.
All right?

56:52.077 --> 56:53.077
I don't know what to do.

56:53.078 --> 56:55.079
Keep the nose down and
level the wings. All right?

56:55.080 --> 56:56.831
- Okay.
- All right.

56:56.832 --> 56:59.292
[JOHNNY]: That's good. Good.

56:59.293 --> 57:01.127
- All right. You're all right.
- How's that?

57:01.128 --> 57:03.171
- All right, now go...
- We should try to go back, shouldn't we?

57:03.172 --> 57:05.673
No, we can't get back.
We have to find a place around here.

57:05.674 --> 57:06.674
Come on. Come on.

57:06.675 --> 57:08.051
There's a...
there's a wheat field.

57:08.052 --> 57:10.093
All right. Good.
You're doing great, son.

57:10.094 --> 57:12.304
Keep your wits about you, okay?

57:12.305 --> 57:14.473
Level your wings.
You got 500 feet to go.

57:14.474 --> 57:15.766
How about that?

57:15.767 --> 57:16.767
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're doing great.

57:16.768 --> 57:19.311
Steady. Steady.

57:19.312 --> 57:22.397
Steady. Bring it in.
Bring it in. Steady.

57:22.398 --> 57:25.192
- Wings level. Keep the wings level.
- Okay.

57:25.193 --> 57:26.527
Leveling my wings.

57:26.528 --> 57:28.111
Is this good? We good?

57:28.112 --> 57:29.279
Great. You're doing great.

57:29.280 --> 57:30.864
Leveling. Leveling.

57:33.326 --> 57:34.409
Bring it in. Bring it in.

57:35.995 --> 57:38.747
Well, coming in, coming in. Wait.

57:38.748 --> 57:42.166
[thud]
What... what happened here?

57:42.167 --> 57:43.501
- Goodness me.
- What?

57:43.502 --> 57:45.503
[chuckles]
The engine was turned off.

57:45.504 --> 57:47.004
Did you turn the engine off?

57:47.005 --> 57:50.383
[LUKE]: The engine turned off?
Is this your idea of a sick joke?

57:50.384 --> 57:51.384
[Johnny laughing]

57:51.385 --> 57:52.677
Why are you laughing?

57:52.678 --> 57:54.345
[laughing]

57:54.346 --> 57:57.932
Confidence comes
with being prepared, my son.

57:57.933 --> 58:00.977
As in golf or life, hand in hand.

58:00.978 --> 58:03.854
[laughs]

58:03.855 --> 58:04.981
I'm about to throw up over here.

58:04.982 --> 58:06.315
You can't play in a tournament

58:06.316 --> 58:10.068
unless you're ready for the unexpected
on game day.

58:11.612 --> 58:12.904
[MABEL]: It smells delicious.

58:12.905 --> 58:14.531
[SARAH]:
Mabel's trout's famous around here.

58:14.532 --> 58:16.032
More famous than her pies?

58:16.659 --> 58:18.076
Couldn't be more famous.

58:18.077 --> 58:23.123
As famous, maybe.
But more famous? [laughs]

58:36.387 --> 58:39.430
For food in a world
where many walk in hunger,

58:39.931 --> 58:42.683
for faith in a world
where many walk in fear,

58:43.643 --> 58:48.689
for friends in a world
where many walk alone,

58:48.690 --> 58:51.400
we give you thanks,
O Lord. Amen.

58:51.401 --> 58:52.693
Amen.

58:52.694 --> 58:53.819
- Amen.
- Amen.

59:00.368 --> 59:02.077
He definitely puts the game first.

59:04.539 --> 59:07.248
Reminds me of someone else
I used to know.

59:08.876 --> 59:10.877
That he does.

59:10.878 --> 59:13.379
Hopefully he finds his way
quicker than me.

59:16.258 --> 59:18.426
- Hey there, stranger.
- Hey.

59:18.427 --> 59:21.596
So, uh, when's the last time
you caught a firefly?

59:21.597 --> 59:25.933
Well, I don't know.
Since I was a little kid.

59:27.061 --> 59:28.436
Well, that's too long.

59:29.104 --> 59:30.897
Come on.

59:34.234 --> 59:36.151
She has Paul's gift.

59:37.904 --> 59:40.364
She always was a daddy's girl.

59:51.209 --> 59:54.127
It's okay. It's okay.

59:54.879 --> 59:56.838
- Hey, Sarah.
- What?

59:57.382 --> 59:59.966
These ones in here
quit making light.

59:59.967 --> 01:00:01.802
Well, that's 'cause they know
they're trapped.

01:00:02.679 --> 01:00:03.804
It makes their lights go out.

01:00:07.933 --> 01:00:09.058
Watch this.

01:00:17.401 --> 01:00:19.652
Freedom's a powerful force.

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:33.123
Not yet.

01:00:38.587 --> 01:00:39.504
I'm sorry.

01:00:42.425 --> 01:00:44.175
No, I...

01:00:45.428 --> 01:00:46.386
It doesn't mean never.

01:01:19.502 --> 01:01:22.337
It's gonna...
It's gonna rain.

01:01:22.338 --> 01:01:24.256
Ready for today's lesson?

01:01:24.257 --> 01:01:26.759
I can only imagine what you got
in store for me today.

01:01:28.136 --> 01:01:29.511
Today we play golf.

01:01:31.555 --> 01:01:33.556
Good. What should I hit, a driver?

01:01:33.557 --> 01:01:35.183
No, no, no, no.

01:01:35.184 --> 01:01:39.020
Today we visit the history of the game

01:01:39.021 --> 01:01:40.229
and its future.

01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:42.190
You're gonna be playing
with hickory sticks

01:01:42.191 --> 01:01:43.900
and a face-on putter.

01:01:45.402 --> 01:01:46.652
Ooh.

01:01:46.653 --> 01:01:47.904
Not bad.

01:01:47.905 --> 01:01:49.405
Perfect.

01:01:49.406 --> 01:01:51.365
S F T.

01:01:51.366 --> 01:01:52.700
One for you.

01:01:55.621 --> 01:01:59.207
See it. Feel it. Trust it.

01:01:59.208 --> 01:02:01.416
Little butter cut over that left tree.

01:02:02.418 --> 01:02:03.752
How far?

01:02:03.753 --> 01:02:05.670
About 310.

01:02:05.671 --> 01:02:07.506
210.

01:02:07.673 --> 01:02:09.508
[thunder]
What's the course record?

01:02:09.509 --> 01:02:12.761
Well, you ever shot a 59?

01:02:12.762 --> 01:02:15.263
You keep playing this way,
you just might.

01:02:16.265 --> 01:02:17.766
Weather permitting, of course.

01:02:19.602 --> 01:02:21.228
[thunder]

01:02:27.068 --> 01:02:27.943
- Boom.
- Yes, sir.

01:02:27.944 --> 01:02:30.194
Not sure we can get this round in.

01:02:30.195 --> 01:02:31.821
There ain't nothing stopping me.

01:02:32.781 --> 01:02:35.908
I'm seeing it, feeling it,
and trusting it.

01:02:42.165 --> 01:02:43.666
[thunder]

01:02:58.347 --> 01:02:59.889
It's time to wrap it up, son.

01:02:59.890 --> 01:03:01.808
It's not the time
to start playing it safe.

01:03:01.809 --> 01:03:03.142
We got one more hole.

01:03:03.143 --> 01:03:05.937
No, no, no.
59 doesn't matter, Luke.

01:03:05.938 --> 01:03:06.938
Well, it matters to me.

01:03:06.939 --> 01:03:09.065
That's not the lesson.
That was never the lesson.

01:03:09.066 --> 01:03:10.650
You spent the whole week

01:03:10.651 --> 01:03:12.944
teaching me how to play
the best golf of my life.

01:03:12.945 --> 01:03:14.904
Now I'm playing it.

01:03:21.036 --> 01:03:23.872
All right. Well, you don't have to
prove anything to me, Luke,

01:03:24.206 --> 01:03:26.291
because I'm not your father.

01:03:26.292 --> 01:03:28.834
You don't know anything about
my dad, so back off!

01:03:28.835 --> 01:03:30.377
No! you can't spend your life

01:03:30.378 --> 01:03:32.296
trying to validate yourself
with a golf score.

01:03:32.297 --> 01:03:33.630
Well, how would you know?

01:03:33.631 --> 01:03:35.215
It looks to me like
you quit on your dream,

01:03:35.216 --> 01:03:37.509
living out here
on this godforsaken goat ranch.

01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:39.011
And this is your dream today?

01:03:39.012 --> 01:03:40.304
This? This is your dream?

01:03:40.305 --> 01:03:42.806
[thunder]

01:03:49.522 --> 01:03:51.315
[JOHNNY]:
You can lead a horse to water,

01:03:51.316 --> 01:03:52.858
but you can't make him drink!

01:03:54.736 --> 01:03:56.569
[thunder]

01:03:56.570 --> 01:03:58.571
[rain falling heavily]

01:04:35.024 --> 01:04:35.857
[Johnny sighs]

01:04:37.026 --> 01:04:39.778
Whoo.
[exhales]

01:04:44.992 --> 01:04:46.117
I'm sorry, Johnny.

01:04:48.079 --> 01:04:49.579
I forgive you, son.

01:05:01.257 --> 01:05:02.800
Whose grave you digging?

01:05:04.511 --> 01:05:06.095
You'll soon see.

01:05:09.724 --> 01:05:11.350
What's yours gonna say?

01:05:15.730 --> 01:05:16.772
Mine?

01:05:16.773 --> 01:05:20.651
Yeah, your epitaph, your headstone.

01:05:21.611 --> 01:05:23.569
What do you want people
to say about you

01:05:23.570 --> 01:05:26.990
when you're gone, huh?

01:05:28.826 --> 01:05:29.867
[sighs]

01:05:29.868 --> 01:05:33.496
Maybe it'll say you shot a...
a 59.

01:05:33.497 --> 01:05:35.248
[chuckles]

01:05:35.249 --> 01:05:36.290
Huh?

01:05:37.626 --> 01:05:39.377
I never thought of it like that.

01:05:41.463 --> 01:05:45.049
Maybe we'll just leave it blank for now.

01:05:50.723 --> 01:05:51.681
No. I mean...

01:05:53.558 --> 01:05:55.100
I'd want it to say...

01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:00.355
something.

01:06:02.025 --> 01:06:05.944
It will. It will.

01:06:07.739 --> 01:06:10.032
But I don't think
that your coming here...

01:06:12.452 --> 01:06:13.869
was an accident.

01:06:16.539 --> 01:06:19.082
But only you can decide what to do
from here on out,

01:06:19.083 --> 01:06:21.459
'cause, I mean,

01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:25.921
there's nothing more
I can teach you, son.

01:06:31.470 --> 01:06:32.553
Whoo.

01:06:35.891 --> 01:06:37.433
Thank you, Johnny.

01:06:37.434 --> 01:06:39.977
No, don't thank me.

01:06:40.729 --> 01:06:42.146
Thank Him.

01:06:42.147 --> 01:06:45.066
'Cause God is all around us.

01:06:45.067 --> 01:06:49.695
Inside of each of us,
if you listen...

01:06:50.447 --> 01:06:53.114
there's a still, small voice of truth

01:06:53.115 --> 01:06:54.407
leading us...

01:06:56.410 --> 01:06:58.203
talking to us...

01:06:58.954 --> 01:07:00.872
and telling you

01:07:00.873 --> 01:07:02.123
that you...

01:07:05.586 --> 01:07:07.587
can see God's face...

01:07:10.049 --> 01:07:13.384
feel his presence...

01:07:13.385 --> 01:07:15.804
trust his love.

01:07:15.805 --> 01:07:16.679
Yeah.

01:07:18.933 --> 01:07:20.557
S F T.

01:07:20.558 --> 01:07:21.809
Huh?

01:07:23.436 --> 01:07:24.645
Whoo.

01:07:25.522 --> 01:07:26.563
S F T.

01:07:28.650 --> 01:07:29.942
God bless you.

01:07:30.735 --> 01:07:31.944
Happy Easter.

01:07:36.991 --> 01:07:38.408
[exhales]

01:08:02.850 --> 01:08:05.143
[JOHNNY]:
Luke, inside this box...

01:08:05.144 --> 01:08:07.979
is a pencil and two pieces of paper.

01:08:08.981 --> 01:08:11.983
One is for writing down
all the truths you've learned...

01:08:11.984 --> 01:08:14.485
during your time here in Utopia.

01:08:14.486 --> 01:08:17.988
The truth that life is about
faith, relationships,

01:08:17.988 --> 01:08:21.158
character, and integrity.

01:08:21.158 --> 01:08:23.243
That God has a purpose
and calling for you...

01:08:23.493 --> 01:08:24.953
that is much deeper...

01:08:24.953 --> 01:08:28.206
than a little white ball
falling into the cup.

01:08:28.207 --> 01:08:31.126
These truths will become
your new heartbeat,

01:08:31.127 --> 01:08:34.796
the foundation of your new life.

01:08:34.796 --> 01:08:37.410
The other piece of paper is
for writing down all the lies...

01:08:37.411 --> 01:08:39.411
you've been told during your life.

01:08:40.011 --> 01:08:41.553
Lies like your golf score...

01:08:41.554 --> 01:08:45.765
being a reflection of your true identity
and self-worth,

01:08:45.765 --> 01:08:49.350
or that failure in golf
is failure in life.

01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:51.645
Take the truths with you,

01:08:51.645 --> 01:08:55.316
but bury the lies
right here, right now.

01:08:55.901 --> 01:08:58.569
Once you have buried your lies,

01:08:59.529 --> 01:09:01.572
chisel your living epitaph.

01:09:04.242 --> 01:09:07.453
[MAN]: ¶ Today I found myself ¶

01:09:07.453 --> 01:09:12.625
¶ After searching all these years ¶

01:09:14.461 --> 01:09:17.170
¶ And the man that I saw ¶

01:09:17.171 --> 01:09:22.508
¶ He wasn't at all
who I thought he'd be ¶

01:09:23.886 --> 01:09:27.721
¶ I was lost when you found me here ¶

01:09:28.432 --> 01:09:32.977
¶ I was broken beyond repair ¶

01:09:34.939 --> 01:09:38.024
¶ Then you came along ¶
- Yeah!

01:09:38.024 --> 01:09:40.109
¶ And you sang your song ¶

01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:42.819
¶ Over me ¶

01:09:45.782 --> 01:09:49.826
¶ It feels like I'm born again ¶

01:09:49.827 --> 01:09:55.290
¶ It feels like I'm living ¶

01:09:55.291 --> 01:09:58.877
¶ For the very first time ¶

01:09:58.878 --> 01:10:03.632
¶ I'm living for the first time ¶

01:10:03.633 --> 01:10:07.678
¶ It feels like I'm born again ¶

01:10:07.679 --> 01:10:12.683
¶ It feels like I'm living ¶

01:10:12.684 --> 01:10:20.299
¶ For the very first time ¶

01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:21.399
¶ For the very first time ¶

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:26.195
¶ It feels like I'm breathing ¶

01:10:26.196 --> 01:10:30.992
¶ It feels like I'm moving ¶

01:10:30.993 --> 01:10:33.995
¶ For the very first time ¶

01:10:33.996 --> 01:10:39.125
¶ In my life ¶

01:10:53.139 --> 01:10:55.348
[knock knock]

01:10:57.435 --> 01:10:58.435
[Luke clears throat]

01:11:00.146 --> 01:11:01.521
All ready to go, are we?

01:11:03.149 --> 01:11:04.441
Yeah, I think so.

01:11:04.442 --> 01:11:06.234
Don't think.

01:11:06.235 --> 01:11:09.321
See, feel, trust.

01:11:09.322 --> 01:11:10.655
[chuckles]

01:11:10.656 --> 01:11:11.780
Yeah.

01:11:12.073 --> 01:11:13.991
Now, before you leave,

01:11:13.992 --> 01:11:15.451
I have something for you.

01:11:16.328 --> 01:11:17.578
I have something here.

01:11:18.538 --> 01:11:22.666
Well, you've given me more
than I can repay, sir.

01:11:22.667 --> 01:11:24.835
Well, gifts aren't meant to be repaid.

01:11:24.836 --> 01:11:27.796
They're meant to be passed along.

01:11:27.797 --> 01:11:28.964
Look at this.

01:11:28.965 --> 01:11:33.385
That was my last tournament.

01:11:33.386 --> 01:11:36.055
You notice anything? Huh?

01:11:37.098 --> 01:11:39.516
Well, you're not
on the leaderboard.

01:11:39.517 --> 01:11:42.185
Well, yeah, that, but no.
Look again. Look again.

01:11:42.186 --> 01:11:43.102
Look.

01:11:45.105 --> 01:11:49.317
- Oh, it's the Texas Open.
- Right.

01:11:49.318 --> 01:11:50.526
That's this weekend.

01:11:50.527 --> 01:11:53.821
Yeah. The tournament's main sponsor
is an old friend.

01:11:53.822 --> 01:11:55.323
He says as a personal favor

01:11:55.324 --> 01:11:59.994
he'll offer you one
of his free exemptions.

01:12:01.538 --> 01:12:03.373
All right?

01:12:03.374 --> 01:12:05.208
[slap on shoulder]
Huh?

01:12:07.294 --> 01:12:08.419
Man.

01:12:12.090 --> 01:12:13.131
[pats on back]

01:12:13.508 --> 01:12:16.176
[exhales] Well, I don't...

01:12:16.177 --> 01:12:17.219
I don't know what to say.

01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:21.098
Well, I think, between you and me,
it's all about the ratings.

01:12:21.099 --> 01:12:23.392
He's probably hoping
you have another meltdown,

01:12:23.393 --> 01:12:26.478
and I'm hoping that
you can prove him wrong.

01:12:27.647 --> 01:12:28.814
Yeah.

01:12:28.815 --> 01:12:30.023
Well, you can count on it.

01:12:30.024 --> 01:12:31.316
Oh, yeah.

01:12:36.697 --> 01:12:40.074
Now, don't go running over
any of them cows,

01:12:40.075 --> 01:12:42.201
because I don't want you
to ruin my pie.

01:12:42.786 --> 01:12:43.828
Well, don't worry.

01:12:43.829 --> 01:12:45.037
I can see a little better now.

01:12:45.038 --> 01:12:46.080
Yeah, you can.

01:12:46.081 --> 01:12:49.458
Okay. God bless you, son.

01:12:49.459 --> 01:12:50.709
God bless you.

01:12:52.254 --> 01:12:54.755
Aw, I'm gonna miss you.

01:12:54.756 --> 01:12:57.049
I'm gonna miss y'all, too.

01:12:57.050 --> 01:12:58.759
Thank you so much for everything.

01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:00.010
You bet.

01:13:09.061 --> 01:13:10.562
Got you a little gift.

01:13:12.064 --> 01:13:13.440
Just keep the lid off it

01:13:13.441 --> 01:13:15.817
and you can come visit
whenever you want.

01:13:16.819 --> 01:13:18.278
Well...

01:13:21.449 --> 01:13:22.866
till next time, then.

01:13:23.451 --> 01:13:24.409
Next time.

01:13:40.383 --> 01:13:42.885
You need any more putting lessons,
you just let me know.

01:13:46.890 --> 01:13:48.098
Hey, Tour boy.

01:13:54.481 --> 01:13:58.692
Well, if you need some lessons
on some cowboy poker, well...

01:13:58.693 --> 01:14:01.278
you're just gonna have
to figure it out yourself.

01:14:05.617 --> 01:14:07.074
[exhales] Johnny.

01:14:07.075 --> 01:14:07.950
Yeah.

01:14:08.702 --> 01:14:10.161
Thank you for everything.

01:14:10.162 --> 01:14:13.748
No. I wanna thank you for everything.

01:14:13.749 --> 01:14:15.416
I really do.

01:14:17.127 --> 01:14:18.544
Yeah.

01:14:25.511 --> 01:14:29.222
And, son, I do believe.

01:14:29.223 --> 01:14:30.515
Okay?

01:14:30.516 --> 01:14:31.849
Yes, sir.

01:14:31.850 --> 01:14:33.100
God bless you.

01:14:33.644 --> 01:14:35.268
- God bless you.
- Thank you.

01:14:47.532 --> 01:14:48.490
[honk honk]

01:15:28.572 --> 01:15:29.738
Let's get you something to eat.

01:15:30.323 --> 01:15:31.240
Yes, Mom.

01:15:44.003 --> 01:15:45.295
Hey, Bud.

01:15:46.797 --> 01:15:49.674
I got you a, uh...
little present.

01:15:52.595 --> 01:15:55.597
Callaway's latest and greatest.
[laughs hesitantly]

01:16:00.603 --> 01:16:01.936
Thanks, Dad.

01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:16.575
Luke, uh... [clears throat]

01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:21.079
my actions last week...

01:16:22.457 --> 01:16:23.624
were wrong.

01:16:26.252 --> 01:16:29.838
I... I pushed you your whole life
to succeed at golf,

01:16:31.381 --> 01:16:34.592
and I never once asked
if that's what you wanted.

01:16:38.263 --> 01:16:39.597
I'm sorry for that.

01:16:43.268 --> 01:16:44.644
Well, I forgive you.

01:16:47.898 --> 01:16:49.523
I only want what's best for you.

01:16:54.696 --> 01:16:55.613
I know.

01:16:58.950 --> 01:17:00.450
I love you, Dad.

01:17:02.286 --> 01:17:03.662
I love you, too, son.

01:17:08.167 --> 01:17:09.626
Well...
[chuckles]

01:17:12.004 --> 01:17:13.672
Ain't looked at mine in a while.

01:17:14.465 --> 01:17:17.509
[clears throat]
Might be overdue.

01:17:22.306 --> 01:17:23.598
Good night, son.

01:17:24.558 --> 01:17:25.517
Welcome home.

01:17:28.396 --> 01:17:29.478
Hey, Dad.

01:17:31.272 --> 01:17:32.439
Yeah?

01:17:34.025 --> 01:17:35.609
I almost forgot.

01:17:38.113 --> 01:17:41.031
You wanna caddy for me this week
in the Texas Open?

01:17:42.575 --> 01:17:43.784
[chuckles]

01:17:46.413 --> 01:17:48.122
[begins to laugh]

01:17:57.924 --> 01:17:59.132
[FEMALE SPORTSCASTER]:
Welcome, everyone,

01:17:59.133 --> 01:18:01.050
to the pride of the Lone Star State,

01:18:01.051 --> 01:18:02.844
the Valero Texas Open.

01:18:02.845 --> 01:18:03.720
I'm Kelly Tilghman...

01:18:03.721 --> 01:18:05.930
with PGA Tour winner
Brandel Chamblee.

01:18:05.931 --> 01:18:10.143
A compelling story this week, Brandel,
is the sponsor invite, Luke Chisolm.

01:18:10.144 --> 01:18:12.937
[BRANDEL]: How does one go
from oblivion to center stage?

01:18:12.938 --> 01:18:14.439
This man knows, Kelly.

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:18.609
In his first PGA Tour event,
he has a chance for redemption.

01:18:18.610 --> 01:18:19.569
[COURSE ANNOUNCER]:
Now on the first tee,

01:18:19.570 --> 01:18:21.946
from Waco, Texas, Luke Chisolm.

01:18:21.947 --> 01:18:24.615
[applause]

01:18:32.290 --> 01:18:34.791
[cheers and applause]

01:18:37.503 --> 01:18:40.505
[BRANDEL]: Round two and three
saw heated action atop the leaderboard.

01:18:40.506 --> 01:18:42.674
Some of golf's biggest names
pining for the lead.

01:18:42.675 --> 01:18:44.593
Rich Beem, Stewart Cink,

01:18:44.594 --> 01:18:47.053
T.K. Oh, and Ricky Fowler.

01:18:53.186 --> 01:18:55.896
[MAN]: Come on, T.K. Oh!

01:18:55.897 --> 01:18:58.314
[KELLY]: This pressure-filled Sunday
at the Texas Open...

01:18:58.315 --> 01:19:00.232
offers an abundance of characters.

01:19:00.233 --> 01:19:01.525
Stewart Cink,

01:19:01.526 --> 01:19:04.361
four-time Masters champ T.K. Oh,

01:19:04.362 --> 01:19:07.072
and we have a local talent
with fresh wounds.

01:19:07.073 --> 01:19:10.659
[BRANDEL]: The surprise performance
coming from Luke Chisolm,

01:19:10.660 --> 01:19:13.496
just two weeks removed
from that complete meltdown...

01:19:13.497 --> 01:19:15.873
at the Lone Star event in San Antonio.

01:19:15.874 --> 01:19:19.376
And now, he finds himself chasing,
of all people, T.K. Oh,

01:19:19.377 --> 01:19:20.419
atop the leaderboard.

01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:23.881
And, Kelly, you really couldn't script it
any better than this.

01:19:23.882 --> 01:19:25.216
No. No, you can't, Brandel.

01:19:25.217 --> 01:19:27.258
We've seen Cinderella stories before,

01:19:27.259 --> 01:19:30.220
but we've also seen what T.K. Oh
has done to those glass slippers.

01:19:30.221 --> 01:19:31.513
He has crushed them.

01:19:31.514 --> 01:19:35.475
[BRANDEL]: And we pick up with
Luke Chisolm now on the 10th tee.

01:19:36.852 --> 01:19:38.269
Let's hit 3-wood.

01:19:38.270 --> 01:19:40.605
Fairway's a little tight.

01:19:43.108 --> 01:19:44.067
[KELLY]:
Chisolm playing it safe here...

01:19:44.735 --> 01:19:47.529
with the 3-wood
on this very reachable par 5.

01:19:56.246 --> 01:19:58.664
[crowd groans]

01:20:01.334 --> 01:20:02.709
[MAN]: That's okay, Luke.

01:20:04.170 --> 01:20:08.048
[BRANDEL]: And that shot will very likely
put some demons in his head.

01:20:08.049 --> 01:20:12.719
It was a shot almost identical to that
that started his monumental blowup...

01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:14.513
a few weeks ago.

01:20:14.514 --> 01:20:16.348
Luke's gonna have to conquer
those demons...

01:20:16.349 --> 01:20:17.641
if he wants to win,

01:20:17.642 --> 01:20:20.018
and that is one of the toughest
things to do in golf.

01:20:20.854 --> 01:20:22.312
Well, what you want to do, son?

01:20:27.067 --> 01:20:28.860
Go back to the tee.

01:20:34.074 --> 01:20:35.283
[MAN]: Head up, Luke.

01:20:39.538 --> 01:20:42.373
Well, it's gonna be
one heck of a par, Dad.

01:20:42.374 --> 01:20:43.457
Oh, you got it.

01:20:46.044 --> 01:20:48.421
[BRANDEL]: Having taken
an unplayable lie on his first drive,

01:20:48.422 --> 01:20:51.674
Chisolm is now back on the tee
hitting his third shot.

01:20:51.675 --> 01:20:53.717
Looks like he's going
with the driver this time, Brandel.

01:20:53.718 --> 01:20:56.094
And, Kelly, I don't know why he didn't
use the driver the first go-around.

01:20:56.095 --> 01:20:59.264
He hasn't sniffed missing a tee shot
all week long

01:20:59.265 --> 01:21:01.349
with that Callaway Octane driver.

01:21:36.801 --> 01:21:39.595
[cheering]

01:21:42.724 --> 01:21:47.811
Perfect!
Exactly as he has all week long.

01:21:47.812 --> 01:21:49.563
See you in the clubhouse, boys.

01:21:49.564 --> 01:21:50.939
Y'all play well.

01:21:52.566 --> 01:21:57.487
[KELLY]: A par after taking an unplayable
could be a turning point for Chisolm.

01:22:02.409 --> 01:22:04.786
This Sunday has given us
a great leaderboard.

01:22:04.787 --> 01:22:07.121
Rich Beem
capable of a big charge,

01:22:07.122 --> 01:22:08.289
question marks surrounding
Luke Chisolm,

01:22:08.290 --> 01:22:11.167
and T.K. Oh
as intimidating as ever.

01:22:11.168 --> 01:22:13.044
[KELLY]: But it looks like
we're winding down to just two.

01:22:13.504 --> 01:22:15.421
A classic
David and Goliath story...

01:22:15.422 --> 01:22:17.382
between Chisolm and T.K. Oh.

01:22:20.385 --> 01:22:23.303
Chisolm from 12 feet...

01:22:23.304 --> 01:22:24.930
and he sinks it!

01:22:24.931 --> 01:22:27.766
Luke Chisolm just one back
of T.K. Oh.

01:22:27.767 --> 01:22:29.726
[BRANDEL]: You know
he's licking his chops right here,

01:22:29.727 --> 01:22:30.686
not only to make birdie,

01:22:30.687 --> 01:22:34.481
but to put the pressure on T.K. Oh
to do the same and avoid a playoff.

01:22:35.024 --> 01:22:37.734
Remember, T.K. Oh
eagled this hole yesterday.

01:22:37.735 --> 01:22:39.736
And now Luke Chisolm
with his second shot...

01:22:39.737 --> 01:22:41.738
to this par 4 on the 18th hole.

01:22:57.754 --> 01:22:59.630
[crowd cheering]

01:22:59.631 --> 01:23:00.631
[MAN IN CROWD]:
In the hole!

01:23:02.009 --> 01:23:03.759
Yeah!

01:23:14.146 --> 01:23:16.647
[cheers and applause]

01:23:16.648 --> 01:23:19.733
[KELLY]: The pressure is really
on T.K. Oh now.

01:23:19.734 --> 01:23:22.819
He has no choice
but to go for the green.

01:23:23.446 --> 01:23:25.655
- Oh, yeah!
- Whoo! Looking good!

01:23:25.656 --> 01:23:27.032
[KELLY]:
This one's looking good, Brandel.

01:23:27.950 --> 01:23:30.869
It's on the green
with a chance at eagle.

01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:33.455
[BRANDEL]: He makes it look easy,
doesn't he, Kelly?

01:23:38.169 --> 01:23:41.963
[KELLY]: What an answer
by the steely veteran T.K. Oh,

01:23:41.964 --> 01:23:43.298
who drove the green.

01:23:43.299 --> 01:23:46.217
If he makes this eagle putt,
he wins.

01:23:51.473 --> 01:23:52.890
[crowd groans]

01:23:58.855 --> 01:24:00.147
[KELLY]:
And how's this for excitement?

01:24:00.148 --> 01:24:02.691
T.K. Oh and Chisolm
are headed to a playoff,

01:24:02.692 --> 01:24:04.318
both men tied at 16 under.

01:24:04.319 --> 01:24:06.320
[BRANDEL]: And T.K. Oh
has the upper hand once again.

01:24:06.321 --> 01:24:09.239
He's never been defeated in a playoff
on the PGA Tour,

01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:11.950
and Luke Chisolm,
his first taste in extra holes.

01:24:11.951 --> 01:24:15.245
[KELLY]: They're going back to the
18th tee, where anything can happen.

01:24:23.295 --> 01:24:25.713
T.K. Oh and Luke Chisolm
are about to tee off...

01:24:25.714 --> 01:24:29.008
on one of the greatest
risk/reward holes in all of golf.

01:24:29.009 --> 01:24:31.636
And earlier, Brandel had a chance
to take a closer look...

01:24:31.637 --> 01:24:34.263
at this tremendous finishing hole.

01:24:34.264 --> 01:24:37.475
The finishing hole here is a great one.

01:24:37.476 --> 01:24:41.062
A drivable par 4 of 355 yards
that plays downhill...

01:24:41.063 --> 01:24:42.688
and gives the players a lot of choices.

01:24:42.689 --> 01:24:45.190
But those choices come with risks.

01:24:45.191 --> 01:24:47.609
The green is protected
by a tree and a bunker...

01:24:47.610 --> 01:24:49.277
and a treacherous water hazard.

01:24:49.278 --> 01:24:52.739
The green itself
is very narrow and fast,

01:24:52.740 --> 01:24:53.907
with a lot of slope in it.

01:24:53.908 --> 01:24:54.991
And a two-putt
from above the hole

01:24:54.992 --> 01:24:56.993
is highly unlikely.

01:24:56.994 --> 01:25:00.205
But one of the worst places
that a player could drive the ball

01:25:00.206 --> 01:25:03.291
would be long and to the left,
in that area there,

01:25:03.292 --> 01:25:06.628
because an up and down
would be almost impossible.

01:25:06.629 --> 01:25:08.839
And his pitch shot

01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:11.550
would most likely run off
the front of the green.

01:25:11.551 --> 01:25:13.135
[WOMAN IN CROWD]:
Come on, T.K.

01:25:13.136 --> 01:25:14.301
[KELLY]:
And there you have it, folks.

01:25:14.302 --> 01:25:18.472
This hole provides the perfect stage
for the drama that's about to unfold.

01:25:18.473 --> 01:25:20.558
[MAN IN CROWD]:
Come on, T.K., let's win this!

01:25:23.145 --> 01:25:24.145
[no dialogue]

01:25:24.354 --> 01:25:27.815
Well, no surprise here, folks.
T.K. Oh has taken driver out.

01:25:27.816 --> 01:25:30.860
Obviously trying to make an eagle
and win this thing outright.

01:25:30.861 --> 01:25:33.612
But in doing so,
he brings double bogey into play.

01:25:33.613 --> 01:25:35.990
T.K. Oh lives for moments like this.

01:25:36.491 --> 01:25:39.660
[KELLY]: And T.K. Oh is one
of perhaps just 10 players...

01:25:39.661 --> 01:25:41.078
who can drive this green.

01:25:41.079 --> 01:25:44.164
We saw him do it just moments ago
in regulation.

01:25:51.213 --> 01:25:53.506
Oh, it sounds like he crushed that one.

01:25:53.507 --> 01:25:54.966
[BRANDEL]:
Yeah, it's a good-looking swing.

01:25:54.967 --> 01:25:57.177
Always in balance.
It took off on the right line.

01:25:57.178 --> 01:25:59.554
But there's more wind now
than there was earlier.

01:25:59.555 --> 01:26:00.722
He's getting more help,

01:26:00.723 --> 01:26:02.765
and with his high ball flight,

01:26:02.766 --> 01:26:05.185
carrying that creek
should not be a problem,

01:26:05.186 --> 01:26:09.606
but holding this green will be.

01:26:09.607 --> 01:26:10.690
[KELLY]: Oh, look at this.

01:26:10.691 --> 01:26:12.858
This could be serious trouble.

01:26:12.859 --> 01:26:15.944
That's the danger zone
Brandel was just describing.

01:26:15.945 --> 01:26:16.945
[MAN IN CROWD]:
One more shot, T.K.!

01:26:23.286 --> 01:26:27.456
[KELLY]: Luke Chisolm going with
the conservative play, iron off the tee.

01:26:27.457 --> 01:26:30.918
[BRANDEL]: Yeah, no surprise there, Kelly.
He's stuck to that game plan all week,

01:26:30.919 --> 01:26:34.046
and with only one exception
has he strayed from the fairway.

01:26:34.047 --> 01:26:35.255
He's looking to put this ball...

01:26:35.256 --> 01:26:37.216
in a spot where he gets
the right number,

01:26:37.217 --> 01:26:38.592
gets a wedge in his hand,

01:26:38.593 --> 01:26:41.719
and he can put the pressure
on T.K. Oh.

01:26:55.192 --> 01:26:57.235
[applause]

01:27:08.747 --> 01:27:10.538
[KELLY]: Luke seems relaxed.

01:27:10.539 --> 01:27:12.874
Is this the same player
from two weeks ago?

01:27:12.875 --> 01:27:14.167
[BRANDEL]:
No, it's not the same player.

01:27:14.168 --> 01:27:17.254
He may have the same swing,
but a completely different outlook.

01:27:17.255 --> 01:27:18.672
[LUKE]: What do we got?

01:27:18.673 --> 01:27:21.049
- [MARTIN]: 75 yards...
- [LUKE]: Uh-huh.

01:27:21.050 --> 01:27:23.218
- [MARTIN]: Just like in regulation.
- [LUKE]: Yeah.

01:27:23.219 --> 01:27:26.012
- [MARTIN]: Lob wedge.
- [LUKE]: Thank you.

01:27:26.639 --> 01:27:29.266
[BRANDEL]: This is the same shot
he had just a few moments ago,

01:27:29.267 --> 01:27:32.269
however, the situation
is entirely different.

01:27:32.270 --> 01:27:36.147
He knows that given T.K. Oh's lie,
he could win this tournament.

01:27:36.148 --> 01:27:37.440
Whereas a few moments ago,

01:27:37.441 --> 01:27:38.857
he was chasing.

01:27:44.906 --> 01:27:45.823
[LUKE]: See it.

01:27:47.450 --> 01:27:48.492
Feel it.

01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:51.161
And trust it.

01:28:00.297 --> 01:28:02.715
[cheers and applause]

01:28:02.716 --> 01:28:04.925
[KELLY]: Not quite like
his hole out in regulation,

01:28:04.926 --> 01:28:06.885
but under the circumstances,
a very solid shot.

01:28:06.886 --> 01:28:10.388
[BRANDEL]: If T.K. Oh was looking for
a gift from an inexperienced Luke,

01:28:10.389 --> 01:28:11.764
he didn't get it.

01:28:11.765 --> 01:28:14.767
T.K. Oh a nearly impossible pitch.

01:28:14.768 --> 01:28:16.185
He's looking at a tight flag,

01:28:16.186 --> 01:28:17.812
the green is running away from him,

01:28:17.813 --> 01:28:19.772
not to mention the water.

01:28:19.773 --> 01:28:22.859
Anything short of hitting that flagstick
and he's probably going swimming.

01:28:22.860 --> 01:28:24.068
[BRANDEL]:
Plain and simple here, Kelly.

01:28:24.069 --> 01:28:25.695
He needs to play away from the hole.

01:28:25.696 --> 01:28:29.073
And it's a pretty safe bet that he's
gonna have a longer birdie putt...

01:28:29.074 --> 01:28:30.408
than Luke's 8-footer.

01:28:30.409 --> 01:28:32.827
[KELLY]:
The ultimate test for T.K. Oh,

01:28:32.828 --> 01:28:35.121
but I wouldn't put it past him.
He's done it before.

01:28:36.248 --> 01:28:37.497
[BRANDEL]: Look at the way
he's sizing this up.

01:28:37.498 --> 01:28:38.665
It almost looks like...

01:28:38.666 --> 01:28:40.167
and he is, I think,

01:28:40.168 --> 01:28:41.209
gonna go right at this hole.

01:28:41.210 --> 01:28:42.919
This absolutely makes no sense to me.

01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:44.713
If he doesn't hole this,

01:28:44.714 --> 01:28:47.090
it's very likely that this ball's
gonna run off of the green.

01:28:47.091 --> 01:28:48.633
[KELLY]: This would really
be something.

01:28:48.634 --> 01:28:51.678
He's got to aim
right for the flagstick.

01:28:51.679 --> 01:28:55.557
Anything short of perfect here,
he's looking at bogie at best.

01:28:55.558 --> 01:28:57.017
That's if he's lucky enough
to avoid the water.

01:28:57.769 --> 01:29:00.395
[BRANDEL]: The only way
to pull this shot off on that line...

01:29:00.396 --> 01:29:02.314
is with a lot of speed, a lot of spin,

01:29:02.315 --> 01:29:06.108
and he has to land it in an area
about as big as a dinner plate.

01:29:17.412 --> 01:29:19.330
[KELLY]: And it looks good.

01:29:22.417 --> 01:29:24.168
It's got a chance.

01:29:25.003 --> 01:29:25.878
[crowd groans]

01:29:25.879 --> 01:29:27.588
Didn't go in. Remarkable!

01:29:27.589 --> 01:29:29.590
[BRANDEL]: He's unlucky, Kelly,
that that ball didn't go in,

01:29:29.591 --> 01:29:31.634
but lucky
that it stayed on the green...

01:29:31.635 --> 01:29:34.595
and gave him about
a 15-foot putt up the hill,

01:29:34.596 --> 01:29:36.596
and maybe he can put
the pressure on Luke.

01:29:36.597 --> 01:29:39.599
[KELLY]: And look at him.
He's not even fazed.

01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:43.144
This is a makeable putt for T.K. Oh.

01:29:43.145 --> 01:29:44.813
Is this where experience pays off?

01:29:44.814 --> 01:29:47.690
[BRANDEL]: Generally speaking,
first-in in a playoff wins.

01:29:47.691 --> 01:29:49.859
And if he makes this, I promise you,

01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:52.070
that hole will look a lot smaller to Luke.

01:29:56.450 --> 01:29:59.869
[KELLY]: How many times has T.K. Oh
been in this exact spot...

01:29:59.870 --> 01:30:01.996
and emerged victorious?

01:30:01.997 --> 01:30:03.748
It's that mental edge...

01:30:03.749 --> 01:30:06.959
that makes him
the great player that he is.

01:30:15.009 --> 01:30:16.885
- [CROWD]: Oh!
- [T.K.]: Ooh!

01:30:16.886 --> 01:30:18.178
[KELLY]: He thought
he had that one.

01:30:18.179 --> 01:30:21.348
[BRANDEL]: T.K. Oh's tee shot
left him with a lot of stress.

01:30:21.349 --> 01:30:23.600
His second shot left him
with a lot of work.

01:30:23.601 --> 01:30:25.727
And now it's Luke
who has the work to do,

01:30:25.728 --> 01:30:28.772
and T.K. Oh no longer has control
of his own fate.

01:30:28.773 --> 01:30:31.358
That control lies with Luke Chisolm.

01:30:33.694 --> 01:30:37.864
[KELLY]: It was a great par
for T.K. Oh just to stay in it.

01:30:37.865 --> 01:30:39.407
But now the door is open...

01:30:39.867 --> 01:30:42.910
for Luke Chisolm
to win the Texas Open.

01:30:42.911 --> 01:30:44.328
[BRANDEL]:
One can only imagine...

01:30:44.329 --> 01:30:46.789
what's going on in the mind
of Luke Chisolm right now.

01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:49.125
Two weeks ago his career was over,

01:30:49.126 --> 01:30:52.628
and now he is one putt away
from taking the Texas Open...

01:30:52.629 --> 01:30:55.631
and beating the best player in golf
in the process.

01:31:17.028 --> 01:31:18.737
[no dialogue]

01:31:26.287 --> 01:31:30.332
[JOHNNY]: Luke knew this putt
was meaningless...

01:31:30.333 --> 01:31:31.499
in the big picture.

01:31:33.293 --> 01:31:35.252
He was now answering
to a higher calling.

01:31:36.213 --> 01:31:39.590
It was time to go to a place
beyond tradition,

01:31:39.591 --> 01:31:42.259
to a place of buried lies...

01:31:42.260 --> 01:31:45.179
and unearthed truths.

01:31:46.723 --> 01:31:50.226
A revolution had begun within Luke's soul.

01:31:50.227 --> 01:31:54.813
He had a purpose and a calling
that went beyond any scoreboard.

01:32:10.955 --> 01:32:14.499
- What?
- It's kind of a putter.

01:32:54.497 --> 01:32:58.165
[JOHNNY]: He saw, felt, trusted,

01:32:58.166 --> 01:33:01.002
and stroked the putt of his life.

01:33:11.513 --> 01:33:16.309
Utopia is defined as a place
of mythical perfection,

01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:18.728
but I knew differently.

01:33:18.729 --> 01:33:21.897
Utopia is indeed real.

01:33:21.898 --> 01:33:25.818
It's a place where the voice
of truth resides...

01:33:25.819 --> 01:33:30.155
and eternal trophies line the shelves.

01:33:30.156 --> 01:33:33.199
A place where there are no accidents.

01:33:35.411 --> 01:33:39.497
I guess you're asking yourselves
whether or not he made the putt.

01:33:40.124 --> 01:33:42.459
The better question is,

01:33:42.460 --> 01:33:44.878
does it really matter?

01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:52.177
How can a game have such an effect
on a man's soul?

01:34:22.666 --> 01:34:26.084
[song intro]

01:35:06.874 --> 01:35:13.505
