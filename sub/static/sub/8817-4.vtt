10:31.225 --> 10:33.358
Never for you guys. Come on.

10:35.562 --> 10:37.729
Ah, that's not Freddy. Shit.

10:40.784 --> 10:41.900
Dude.

10:41.902 --> 10:43.735
How far do I have to
go not to be bothered?

10:43.737 --> 10:44.836
I wanted to catch you...

10:44.872 --> 10:46.471
- Sorry I'm late, man.
- [Ike] Freddy!

10:46.507 --> 10:47.989
Freddy! Hey, what's up, brother?

10:48.042 --> 10:49.574
- Hey.
- Hey, jump on. Jump on.

10:49.576 --> 10:51.243
- I'll be there in a sec.
- Okay.

10:51.245 --> 10:54.012
Have to talk about the Cross-Co. short.

10:54.048 --> 10:55.247
[Butch] I didn't understand the play

10:55.299 --> 10:56.415
when you had me make it.

10:56.467 --> 10:57.466
Now I do.

10:57.501 --> 10:58.917
We should get out of the position.

10:58.969 --> 11:00.419
I'd never do that.

11:00.471 --> 11:02.421
It's the only way to eliminate
potential conflict of interest.

11:02.423 --> 11:04.723
- [Bobby] There's no conflict.
- [Butch] Come on.

11:04.758 --> 11:06.091
It won't look good.

11:06.143 --> 11:07.926
You set the position then jump
onto the board of YumTime.

11:07.978 --> 11:09.594
[Bobby] If I made moves...

11:09.596 --> 11:11.430
- [camera shutter clicks]
- ...based on what looked good,

11:11.432 --> 11:13.231
I'm damn sure I wouldn't
have this puppy right here.

11:13.267 --> 11:14.516
And I'm on lots of boards.

11:14.568 --> 11:15.817
[car door closes]

11:15.853 --> 11:17.235
Those don't have contracts
they're dumping

11:17.271 --> 11:18.837
with Cross-Co. Trucking.

11:21.442 --> 11:23.108
- [car door closes]
- A guy I talked to

11:23.160 --> 11:24.443
who traffics in the name

11:24.445 --> 11:26.027
says he's hearing whispers

11:26.080 --> 11:27.546
the contract's going to be cancelled.

11:27.581 --> 11:29.614
This opens us up to contract steering,

11:29.666 --> 11:30.949
manipulation.

11:30.951 --> 11:31.959
It opens me up.

11:32.453 --> 11:35.387
I didn't have the board seat
when we took the short position.

11:35.422 --> 11:38.056
And I don't have anything to do
with the day-to-day at YumTime

11:38.092 --> 11:39.458
or their contracts with vendors.

11:39.460 --> 11:41.793
There's no paper that says I do.

11:41.845 --> 11:44.713
So, the only thing you're
open to is making some money,

11:44.765 --> 11:46.565
which would make a nice change.

11:46.600 --> 11:47.716
[Freddy chuckles]

11:47.768 --> 11:49.885
Like your wife says, hold
the fucking position

11:49.937 --> 11:51.803
until I tell you I'm done.

11:51.805 --> 11:53.772
[laughter] Come on. Come on.

11:53.807 --> 11:54.890
I guess that meeting's over, huh?

11:54.942 --> 11:56.191
Shotgun!

11:56.226 --> 11:57.476
All right.

11:58.365 --> 12:00.729
Inside information, specifically.

12:00.781 --> 12:02.314
Where is it coming from?

12:02.316 --> 12:03.381
[sighs]

12:03.417 --> 12:05.150
Where does rain come from?

12:05.202 --> 12:07.152
The sky. God himself.

12:07.204 --> 12:12.157
[chuckles] Information comes
from everywhere and all at once,

12:12.209 --> 12:13.892
from guys who owe him,

12:13.927 --> 12:17.546
guys he's worked, charmed,
hired, paid off for years.

12:17.581 --> 12:20.465
Sell-side traders looking to get
a gold star next to their name.

12:20.501 --> 12:21.583
Disgruntled employees,

12:21.635 --> 12:23.335
execs at the company in question,

12:23.337 --> 12:25.837
an analyst covering a stock
who feels underpaid.

12:25.839 --> 12:27.839
Like rain, it comes.

12:27.891 --> 12:30.175
Sounds like it's great to be Axe.

12:30.177 --> 12:33.178
It is. But it's a zero-sum game.

12:33.230 --> 12:35.096
Kill and eat or be eaten.

12:35.149 --> 12:36.481
I mean, don't kid yourselves.

12:36.517 --> 12:37.732
These guys are like kings.

12:37.768 --> 12:40.318
Someone is always coming
to assassinate them.

12:44.775 --> 12:46.191
You ready, Quince?

12:46.193 --> 12:47.359
[Quince] Yeah.

12:47.361 --> 12:49.277
But you're gonna love what I just heard

12:49.329 --> 12:51.263
from this British fruit, Farraday,

12:51.298 --> 12:53.098
my guy on the stock loan desk.

12:53.133 --> 12:55.167
Guess which hedge-funder's got himself

12:55.202 --> 12:56.952
in a precarious short,

12:57.004 --> 12:58.537
ripe for a squeeze?

12:58.539 --> 13:00.422
If you're talking Bobby Axelrod,

13:00.457 --> 13:03.708
this just became my
favorite round of the year.

13:03.760 --> 13:06.211
- [Chuck Sr.] You have details?
- I do.

13:06.213 --> 13:09.881
Hit first. And talk.

13:09.883 --> 13:13.318
I want to know what stock
I'm running up his ass.

13:13.353 --> 13:17.889
It's a trucking company... Cross-Co.

13:19.226 --> 13:21.459
Right here on the course?

13:21.495 --> 13:23.862
I'm President Emeritus.

13:23.897 --> 13:26.231
I do what I want.

13:26.233 --> 13:27.232
[chuckling]

13:27.284 --> 13:29.568
All right. To me.

13:31.038 --> 13:32.003
[Bobby] Come on.

13:32.039 --> 13:32.904
Eat those.

13:32.906 --> 13:34.372
- [Ike] Wow.
- Fuckers.

13:34.408 --> 13:35.740
There's nothing I can do.

13:35.792 --> 13:36.808
It was the only diamond in my hand.

13:36.843 --> 13:38.243
You know I can still read you,

13:38.245 --> 13:39.644
same as in ninth grade, right?

13:39.680 --> 13:41.146
I know when you're lying.

13:41.181 --> 13:42.480
I know when you're telling the truth.

13:42.516 --> 13:44.482
- Which is fucking rare.
- Blow me.

13:44.518 --> 13:46.585
- [Freddy] Truthful request.
- [Ike] Exactly.

13:46.587 --> 13:48.420
- Eat another.
- [Bobby] Guys, come on.

13:48.472 --> 13:50.472
You even think about letting me win?

13:50.507 --> 13:52.324
- My plane?
- [Freddy] Oh, yeah?

13:52.359 --> 13:54.359
When we boxed in my basement,
you think about letting me win?

13:54.394 --> 13:56.695
[laughs] I'd try.

13:56.730 --> 13:58.597
You'd stick your fucking jaw out
every time you threw a cross.

13:58.599 --> 13:59.864
[Bobby] It would just, like,
sit there, begging to be hit.

13:59.900 --> 14:01.099
Freddy the cheat.

14:01.151 --> 14:04.002
Yeah, but I seem to recall
beating all of your asses.

14:04.037 --> 14:05.503
- Indeed.
- You had the ape strength.

14:05.539 --> 14:06.938
[Bobby] Ape smell, anyway.

14:06.990 --> 14:08.440
[laughter]

14:08.442 --> 14:10.692
You know, the best thing was
is that you always thought

14:10.744 --> 14:11.943
that you were gonna win, Axe,

14:11.945 --> 14:13.511
right up until the moment that you fell.

14:17.117 --> 14:20.118
[Bobby] You know, some
of us have changed.

14:20.170 --> 14:22.187
Like when we used to play this,

14:22.222 --> 14:23.872
I always used to try to shoot the moon.

14:23.924 --> 14:24.956
Back then, I was reckless

14:24.958 --> 14:26.541
and, you know, I had nothing to lose,

14:26.593 --> 14:28.126
so I'd risk it all at the same time.

14:28.128 --> 14:31.179
But, you know, not now.

14:31.214 --> 14:34.799
- You're still reckless.
- You just mask it better.

14:34.851 --> 14:36.718
You still need to crush, not just win.

14:36.770 --> 14:39.070
Still need to knock me the
fuck out in my own basement.

14:39.106 --> 14:41.723
Whoa, Freddy. [chuckling] Take it easy.

14:41.775 --> 14:43.308
What the fuck?

14:43.310 --> 14:45.060
I mean, we used to go at each other hard

14:45.112 --> 14:46.811
all the time out of respect.

14:46.813 --> 14:48.213
[Ike] That's the kind
of friendship it was.

14:48.248 --> 14:50.548
What kind of prick would he
be if he took it easy now?

14:50.584 --> 14:52.484
Hey, I'm just pointing out
that while he's telling us

14:52.486 --> 14:53.818
he doesn't shoot the moon anymore,

14:53.870 --> 14:56.921
he just shot the fucking moon on us.

14:56.957 --> 14:59.074
[laughs]

14:59.126 --> 15:02.093
Unless you can take
this, which you can't.

15:02.129 --> 15:03.561
No. Sh...

15:03.597 --> 15:04.763
[Seids] Freddy, you're the
one who fucked that one up.

15:04.798 --> 15:06.214
I mean, you saw what he was up to.

15:06.249 --> 15:07.832
I mean, I caught on a little bit later,

15:07.834 --> 15:09.901
but I didn't have the cards
to do anything about it.

15:09.936 --> 15:10.969
But you did.

15:11.004 --> 15:12.420
I mean, you haven't changed at all.

15:12.472 --> 15:13.638
I mean, y-you were just waiting

15:13.674 --> 15:15.006
for somebody to stop him, like Ike...

15:15.058 --> 15:16.057
- [Bobby] Right.
- ...and you were just trying

15:16.093 --> 15:17.175
to preserve your own position.

15:17.227 --> 15:18.777
So, now I'm a dick 'cause
I'm trying to win?

15:18.812 --> 15:19.844
- Yes.
- Yeah.

15:19.896 --> 15:21.279
- You're the dick.
- Yeah. You're the dick.

15:21.315 --> 15:24.582
The king. Who protects his flank?

15:24.618 --> 15:26.618
My client is getting hungry.

15:26.653 --> 15:27.852
You are.

15:27.904 --> 15:30.572
We'll take an hour... in a minute.

15:30.607 --> 15:32.073
Flank.

15:32.109 --> 15:34.526
Prime brokers, trading
arms of the big banks.

15:34.528 --> 15:36.528
On paper, they're supposed
to serve two functions...

15:36.530 --> 15:38.747
Provide credit and execute trades.

15:38.782 --> 15:39.864
They're like loan sharks

15:39.866 --> 15:41.599
for guys too rich to use loan sharks.

15:41.635 --> 15:43.068
Example.

15:44.204 --> 15:45.704
They let you trade on margin,

15:45.756 --> 15:47.339
lever up your book two,
close to three times,

15:47.374 --> 15:48.640
even these days.

15:48.675 --> 15:50.425
And when you stumble,
they're there to catch you,

15:50.460 --> 15:52.110
even if it means they
take a short-term loss.

15:52.145 --> 15:53.545
Why would they do that?

15:53.597 --> 15:56.548
Their business model is like a casino's.

15:56.550 --> 15:58.116
Take care of the whales.

15:58.151 --> 16:00.218
So, it's in their interest to serve him

16:00.220 --> 16:02.220
in whatever way he needs.

16:02.222 --> 16:04.389
Right up until the whale gets beached.

16:06.526 --> 16:09.611
Wags, Roytan upgraded CXC, Cross-Co.
Trucking,

16:09.646 --> 16:10.895
to a "strong buy."

16:10.947 --> 16:11.946
Shit.

16:11.982 --> 16:14.065
That's bad for our short. Target?

16:14.117 --> 16:15.400
They think it could hit $90.

16:15.402 --> 16:17.202
Fuck!

16:17.237 --> 16:19.954
Double scoop of shit.

16:19.990 --> 16:22.107
[chuckles] Look at that e-mail.

16:22.142 --> 16:24.008
They're recalling our shares.

16:24.044 --> 16:25.410
Pulling the fucking rug.

16:25.412 --> 16:26.778
I'm calling Axe.

16:30.384 --> 16:32.183
Hey, Chief. Sorry to bother you.

16:32.219 --> 16:34.919
[Wags] <i> Roytan analysts pumped it
up on Cross-Co., target of $90,</i>

16:34.971 --> 16:37.088
right when the prime e-mailed
to take the stock back.

16:37.140 --> 16:38.840
That can't be a coincidence.

16:38.892 --> 16:40.308
<i>No.</i>

16:40.343 --> 16:42.427
Son of a bitch.

16:42.479 --> 16:44.646
It's a short squeeze.

16:44.681 --> 16:47.015
Someone found out about our position.

16:47.067 --> 16:48.867
Guys on the prime broker
desks have looser lips

16:48.902 --> 16:51.336
than my first wife after the second kid.

16:51.371 --> 16:53.471
<i>What do you want to do? Bleed some off?</i>

16:53.507 --> 16:54.672
No. We got to hold.

16:54.708 --> 16:56.274
It's gonna pay off big time.

16:56.309 --> 16:59.210
Get the fucking prime broker
on the phone right now.

16:59.246 --> 17:00.445
[telephone rings]

17:00.447 --> 17:01.780
[Bobby] <i> Farraday. Wags and Axe.</i>

17:01.832 --> 17:02.714
Gentlemen.

17:02.749 --> 17:04.782
Don't "gentlemen" me.

17:04.785 --> 17:07.117
We need another day on
Cross-Co., plain and simple.

17:07.170 --> 17:09.537
Axe, you know how important
your business is to me,

17:09.589 --> 17:12.223
and ordinarily, I would, but
we need the shares back now.

17:12.259 --> 17:13.791
[Farraday] <i> Or you can
buy in on the market.</i>

17:13.794 --> 17:15.292
Why don't you buy the stock for us

17:15.345 --> 17:16.728
and hold it as a courtesy?

17:16.762 --> 17:19.196
Ordinarily, I'd take the loss
for you with a smile, Axe,

17:19.232 --> 17:21.132
but no accommodations.

17:21.184 --> 17:22.901
This one's coming from on high.

17:22.935 --> 17:25.136
- Quincy's office?
- No comment.

17:25.188 --> 17:28.640
You are making a $100
million fuck-up here.

17:28.642 --> 17:30.809
You spent years becoming my main prime.

17:30.861 --> 17:31.976
You're losing me now.

17:32.028 --> 17:33.311
I'm pulling my business.

17:33.313 --> 17:34.529
[Farraday] <i>My hands are tied.</i>

17:34.564 --> 17:36.064
If you don't make the borrow on the stock

17:36.116 --> 17:37.115
by opening bell tomorrow,

17:37.150 --> 17:38.399
I've been instructed to buy you in

17:38.452 --> 17:39.551
on your entire position.

17:42.088 --> 17:44.222
This isn't coming from me, Axe.

17:44.257 --> 17:45.156
- [dial tone]
- Axe?

17:45.208 --> 17:46.391
I hung up on the little tool.

17:46.426 --> 17:47.659
Good.

17:47.694 --> 17:48.860
What now?

17:48.895 --> 17:51.229
Scour the 13-F for Cross-Co.

17:51.264 --> 17:53.364
Find me the top 10 shareholders.

17:53.400 --> 17:56.401
Hedge funds, not institutions.

17:56.436 --> 17:58.603
I need someone I can
call for these shares.

17:58.638 --> 18:00.004
You got it.

18:00.006 --> 18:02.006
[cellphone thuds]

18:07.347 --> 18:08.513
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:08.515 --> 18:10.114
Were you in the proffer
on Axelrod this morning?

18:10.150 --> 18:11.282
No. Why?

18:11.318 --> 18:12.233
Who was it with?

18:12.269 --> 18:14.185
Are they signing up a cooperator?

18:14.187 --> 18:15.887
I could get a jump on the release.

18:17.023 --> 18:18.356
You'll find out when
it's time to find out.

18:18.358 --> 18:20.859
Of course.

18:25.198 --> 18:27.532
[Ike] So, what happened
on the plane, man?

This wasn't about me

This was about me striking
at our common enemy,

51:51.587 --> 51:52.586
I do understand.

51:52.638 --> 51:53.921
You want me to get Axe

51:53.923 --> 51:56.173

Okay.

It's a sell-off.
