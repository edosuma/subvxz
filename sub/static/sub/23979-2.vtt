00:01.930 --> 00:03.295
Stella: Previously on
"Life Sentence"...

00:03.330 --> 00:05.492
For the last eight years,
I've been living with cancer,

00:05.530 --> 00:07.362
so I tried to live
my life to the fullest.

00:07.400 --> 00:10.108
I even went to Paris
and married a guy I just met.

00:10.140 --> 00:11.437
After all, I'm dying.

00:11.470 --> 00:12.403
You're not dying.

00:12.440 --> 00:13.635
I'm cured.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.170
We all kept stuff from you.

00:15.210 --> 00:17.042
We may have to
sell the house.

00:17.080 --> 00:19.378
He sells his ADD medication
to soccer moms

00:19.420 --> 00:22.139
and uses your cancer to guilt
them into sleeping with him.

00:22.190 --> 00:23.749
Ida: I'm coming out.

00:23.790 --> 00:26.282
I couldn't help but wonder
if anyone still had my back.

00:26.320 --> 00:27.617
And then I realized...

00:27.660 --> 00:29.685
he did.

00:29.730 --> 00:34.099
* Every time you said
this time I will be better *

00:34.130 --> 00:35.256
* I believed you

00:35.300 --> 00:37.394
A week ago, I found out
my cancer was cured

00:37.430 --> 00:39.137
and the eight years
my family spent

00:39.170 --> 00:41.138
taking care of me
had ruined their lives.

00:41.170 --> 00:45.061
I was determined to make it up
to them, but it wasn't easy.

00:45.110 --> 00:47.408
My father was knee deep
in debt, so I was helping him

00:47.440 --> 00:49.579
come to terms with
selling our family home.

00:49.610 --> 00:51.408
I don't want to sell.

00:51.450 --> 00:52.576
I'm not ready!

00:54.520 --> 00:56.181
I'll get him there.

00:56.220 --> 00:57.619
And I'll get him
to put on pants.

00:57.650 --> 01:01.188
My brother had used my cancer
as an excuse not to grow up,

01:01.220 --> 01:03.086
so I was putting
an end to that.

01:03.130 --> 01:05.690
You got a married woman
pregnant, Aiden.

01:05.730 --> 01:07.698
It's time to deal with it.

01:07.730 --> 01:09.164
I feel like I am.

01:09.200 --> 01:10.827
Call Marlene.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.731
Marlene: Hello?
Ooh...

01:14.770 --> 01:16.704
My sister put all her dreams
on hold for me,

01:16.740 --> 01:19.539
so I was pushing her
to start her first novel.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.207
Children: Aunt Stelly!
Okay, guys.

01:21.240 --> 01:22.776
Time to let Mommy write.
Aunt Stelly!

01:22.810 --> 01:24.608
Aunt Stelly!
Go upstairs. Okay.

01:24.650 --> 01:26.618
Go upstairs.

01:26.650 --> 01:28.448
Ah, yes. Coffee.

01:28.480 --> 01:31.313
Okay. Apparently
it's all for her.

01:31.350 --> 01:31.839
Yeah.

01:31.890 --> 01:33.380
As for my mom?

01:33.420 --> 01:34.649
Since she blew up
our whole family,

01:34.690 --> 01:37.182
she needed to know someone
was still there for her.

01:37.230 --> 01:38.880
You know that best part
about kissing a woman?

01:38.930 --> 01:40.420
No whiskers.

01:40.460 --> 01:42.622
Wherever your dad rubbed
his face, I got a rash.

01:42.670 --> 01:44.263
But not with Poppy.

01:44.300 --> 01:46.598
Super fun story, Mom.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.460
When I wasn't taking
care of my family,

01:48.500 --> 01:50.229
I was getting to know
the handsome stranger

01:50.270 --> 01:53.205
I married on a whim.

01:53.240 --> 01:54.378
That part was fun.

01:54.410 --> 01:56.242
* How can a single moment

01:56.280 --> 01:59.614
* Always set you up
for failure? *

01:59.650 --> 02:01.744
Ooh.

02:01.780 --> 02:05.387
Do you know
how lucky I am?

02:05.420 --> 02:07.889
I get to wake up next to you
every morning

02:07.920 --> 02:09.228
for the rest of my life.

02:09.259 --> 02:12.457
If I say yes,
I'll sound full of myself.

02:13.260 --> 02:14.659
But yes.

02:14.700 --> 02:16.725
And ditto.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.522
Great move putting
the air mattress in front

02:18.570 --> 02:20.265
of the stove
to save money on heat.

02:20.300 --> 02:22.302
You know, if we get really
hard pressed for cash,

02:22.340 --> 02:24.365
we could push it closer,

02:24.410 --> 02:25.935
let it explode, and sue
the manufacturer. Oh.

02:25.970 --> 02:29.406
And that would give me a reason
to put my law degree into use.

02:29.450 --> 02:31.305
You said you worked
in finance in London.

02:31.350 --> 02:34.240
I did. But I also went
to law school.

02:34.280 --> 02:36.385
Fascinating.
Mm.

02:36.420 --> 02:37.888
Bye!
Bye, babe.

02:37.920 --> 02:39.752
Clearly, I still had
a lot to learn about Wes.

02:39.790 --> 02:42.589
But we had all the time
in the world.

02:42.630 --> 02:43.586
Hello.
Oh.

02:43.630 --> 02:44.620
Miss Abbott?

02:44.660 --> 02:47.254
I'm Agent Stern
from United States Citizenship

02:47.300 --> 02:48.756
and Immigration Services.

02:48.800 --> 02:52.930
I'm here to investigate
the legitimacy of your marriage.

02:52.970 --> 02:55.598
Or so I thought.

02:55.640 --> 02:58.405
* Don't worry about a thing

02:58.440 --> 03:02.343
* You'll learn to live again

03:02.380 --> 03:04.769
* You're gonna learn
to live again *

03:04.810 --> 03:09.281
* Oh

03:09.320 --> 03:11.618
Your marriage was flagged,
Miss Abbott,

03:11.650 --> 03:13.857
because Mr. Charles filed
the marriage certificate

03:13.890 --> 03:15.449
after his visa expired.

03:15.490 --> 03:16.924
No, no.
That's not true.

03:16.960 --> 03:18.428
Stella sent that in.

03:18.460 --> 03:20.622
Late.

03:20.660 --> 03:22.264
I'm sorry.

03:22.300 --> 03:24.928
To be fair, there were
no real consequences

03:24.970 --> 03:27.962
to my actions
until last week.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.707
And it's Mrs. Abbott,

03:29.740 --> 03:33.734
because we are
legitimately married.

03:33.780 --> 03:35.737
But you're keeping
your maiden name?

03:35.780 --> 03:37.976
-Yes.

03:38.010 --> 03:39.876
- We haven't
figured that out.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.672
Why don't you two
share a bed?

03:41.720 --> 03:43.449
We do share a bed.

03:43.490 --> 03:44.719
Then who sleeps
on the floor?

03:44.750 --> 03:46.787
Oh, we both
sleep on the floor.

03:46.820 --> 03:48.481
Why would you do that?

03:48.520 --> 03:53.026
Because we're poor and we
need to use our stove for heat.

03:53.060 --> 03:57.293
Although, the sex that we had
on that mattress was so hot

03:57.330 --> 03:59.731
we may have heated up
the entire loft.

03:59.770 --> 04:01.898
It was so crazy hot
you wouldn't believe it.

04:01.940 --> 04:03.806
But you should believe it
because it did happen.

04:03.840 --> 04:05.535
And I realize that I'm making it
sound fake by over-explaining it,

04:05.570 --> 04:06.901
but it's not
because it is fake --

04:06.940 --> 04:08.339
it's because I'm not sure
how to talk about sex

04:08.380 --> 04:09.575
in front of strangers.

04:09.610 --> 04:10.577
True.

04:10.610 --> 04:12.317
I'm gonna need you to come
to my office on Monday

04:12.350 --> 04:14.444
for a formal interview
to determine

04:14.480 --> 04:17.745
if Mr. Charles
is facing deportation.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.427
I can't believe
I could get deported.

04:23.460 --> 04:25.758
Wes, I am not gonna
let that happen.

04:25.790 --> 04:28.293
If there is one thing I know,
it is that no one,

04:28.330 --> 04:29.820
not even
the United States government,

04:29.870 --> 04:31.497
is gonna come between us.

04:31.530 --> 04:35.433
Do you remember
how we met?

04:35.470 --> 04:37.837
Fate literally
brought us together.

04:39.840 --> 04:42.548
Just like in the movies.

04:44.480 --> 04:48.542
Look, you are the only man
I have ever loved,

04:48.580 --> 04:52.483
and I am the only woman
you have ever loved.

04:52.520 --> 04:55.387
We're meant
to be together.

04:57.030 --> 04:57.883
You're right.

04:57.930 --> 04:59.989
Hell yeah, I'm right.

05:00.030 --> 05:01.657
So, here's the plan --

05:01.700 --> 05:04.089
You go online and figure
out everything

05:04.130 --> 05:05.461
they might ask us
in that interview.

05:05.500 --> 05:06.797
I will come straight home
after work

05:06.840 --> 05:08.433
and we will spend
the entire night

05:08.470 --> 05:09.733
learning everything
that there is to know

05:09.770 --> 05:12.933
about each other like
our marriage depends on it.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.630
I'll see you at home.

05:14.680 --> 05:15.909
5:00 sharp.

05:15.940 --> 05:17.544
Okay.
Bye.

05:17.580 --> 05:18.900
Bye.

05:18.950 --> 05:21.612
As Wes walked away
with sad body,

05:21.650 --> 05:23.084
I wanted to go tell him

05:23.120 --> 05:24.940
everything
was going to be okay.

05:27.120 --> 05:29.350
But I was late for work.

05:30.960 --> 05:34.396
Our design is just a leaf, but I
do expect you to make it right.

05:34.430 --> 05:35.420
Watch and learn.

05:35.460 --> 05:36.768
The problem with being sick,

05:36.800 --> 05:38.461
when you'd normally
go to college

05:38.500 --> 05:39.661
and figure out what to do
with your life,

05:39.700 --> 05:42.863
is you end up with this
20-year-old as a boss.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.969
Perfect.
As usual.

05:45.010 --> 05:46.774
Also, leave your drama
at the door.

05:46.810 --> 05:48.835
Work is for work,
not socializing.

05:48.880 --> 05:49.870
Totally got it.

05:49.910 --> 05:51.605
Stella. Hi.

05:51.650 --> 05:55.018
I just need to talk
to my mom real quick.

05:55.050 --> 05:56.711
Mom,
what are you doing here?

05:56.750 --> 05:59.515
Oh. I came to tell you
some good news.

05:59.560 --> 06:02.780
We got an offer
on the house.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.480
That's great.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.919
I'm not sure Dad's gonna be
as excited as you are.

06:06.960 --> 06:08.655
Well, I'd argue that I'm not
excited that he left me

06:08.700 --> 06:10.589
in the dark about us
having no money.

06:10.630 --> 06:12.632
Anyway, the best part is,
the buyers want it ASAP,

06:12.670 --> 06:15.492
furniture and all,
so if there's anything you want,

06:15.540 --> 06:18.464
you got to come
and grab it today.

06:18.510 --> 06:20.569
Let me break it to Dad,
okay?

06:20.610 --> 06:23.875
Maybe we could even have one
last family dinner there.

06:23.910 --> 06:26.618
So we can say goodbye.

06:26.650 --> 06:29.142
I really think that it'll
make him feel better.

06:29.180 --> 06:30.614
Whatever you need,
sweetie.

06:30.650 --> 06:31.640
Bye.

06:34.460 --> 06:38.624
Huh.
She's being really cavalier.

06:38.660 --> 06:41.755
Is she?
Tell me everything.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.529
I just thought selling
our family home

06:43.570 --> 06:46.767
might affect her more,
but I --

06:46.800 --> 06:49.838
Oh,
you don't care at all.

06:49.870 --> 06:53.636
Back to work.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.569
I snuck out of there early
so I could get my stuff

06:55.610 --> 06:56.645
and still make it home

06:56.680 --> 06:59.513
for my 5:00 p.m.
study session with Wes.

07:01.850 --> 07:03.545
Marlene: Aiden!
Oh, no.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.945
I know you're in there!

07:05.990 --> 07:07.185
Hey, Marlene.

07:07.220 --> 07:09.928
You can't avoid
responsibility forever!

07:09.960 --> 07:11.951
I don't know,
that's kind of his thing.

07:11.990 --> 07:13.151
I'm losing it.

07:13.200 --> 07:16.056
Which is why Aiden
in avoiding me.

07:16.100 --> 07:20.537
I think he's avoiding you
because you're having his baby.

07:20.570 --> 07:24.803
It's crazy, I'm gonna have
a baby with my drug dealer.

07:24.840 --> 07:26.069
Oh, my God.

07:26.110 --> 07:29.171
I've finally
become my mother.

07:29.210 --> 07:30.974
Oh, I have to go.

07:31.010 --> 07:32.512
Oh--

07:34.680 --> 07:36.990
Aiden, were you
just hiding in there?

07:37.020 --> 07:38.886
No...

07:38.920 --> 07:40.957
I was also
playing video games.

07:40.990 --> 07:41.889
Are you kidding me?

07:41.920 --> 07:43.126
I can explain.

07:43.160 --> 07:44.082
Go ahead.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.859
Oh, you mean right now?

07:47.000 --> 07:51.028
[ Indistinct arguing
in distance ]

07:51.070 --> 07:52.560
Diego.

07:52.600 --> 07:53.738
What's happening up
there?

07:53.770 --> 07:54.635
Uh...

07:54.670 --> 07:56.092
nothing healthy.

07:58.670 --> 08:00.707
Is this
Lizzie's old stuff?

08:00.740 --> 08:02.742
Uh, yeah.
I told her I would grab it,

08:02.780 --> 08:04.771
since she is just
sitting at home

08:04.810 --> 08:06.847
still staring
at a blank page one.

08:06.880 --> 08:08.974
What? She hasn't written
anything yet?

08:09.020 --> 08:10.249
No. Nada.

08:10.290 --> 08:11.610
Nothing.

08:11.650 --> 08:15.109
But she is convinced
that this unicorn lamp

08:15.160 --> 08:18.983
is the inspiration
she needs.

08:19.030 --> 08:20.555
Not gonna lie,
it seems like a stretch.

08:20.600 --> 08:21.795
-Yeah.
-Oh, please.

08:21.830 --> 08:23.719
You should be thanking
your lucky stars

08:23.770 --> 08:25.761
I got someone to buy
this stupid house.

08:25.800 --> 08:27.029
Why do they
get our furniture?

08:27.070 --> 08:28.765
They're not even meeting
our asking price.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.735
-Guys, come on.
-Don't bother.

08:31.770 --> 08:33.578
After about 40 minutes,

08:33.610 --> 08:35.828
one of them usually tires out
and wanders off.

08:35.880 --> 08:38.008
Our asking price
is too high.

08:38.049 --> 08:40.144
This house hasn't been
updated in years, Peter.

08:40.179 --> 08:42.318
The house has only been
on the market for a week.

08:42.350 --> 08:44.078
Let's slow down.

08:44.120 --> 08:46.589
Diego, will you tell her
she's being ridiculous?

08:46.620 --> 08:47.883
Yeah,
I'm gonna pass on that.

08:47.920 --> 08:49.058
Stella,
will you tell him

08:49.090 --> 08:50.285
that something is
better than nothing?

08:50.330 --> 08:51.786
Nope.

08:51.830 --> 08:53.719
Guys, hey,
here's an idea --

08:53.760 --> 08:55.819
Why don't you two sit down,
talk it out,

08:55.860 --> 08:57.828
instead of acting like
you're gonna kill each other?

08:57.870 --> 09:00.032
No. Enough. You know what?
You better sign it.

09:00.070 --> 09:01.834
Who cares
if it's a little low?

09:01.870 --> 09:03.804
Oh, easy for you to say, Ida --
you don't have a job you were

09:03.840 --> 09:06.309
hoping to retire from
before you were 100.

09:06.340 --> 09:08.138
Son of a...

09:08.180 --> 09:10.171
Peter.

09:10.210 --> 09:12.008
See?
Wandered off.

09:12.050 --> 09:13.711
Can you believe
all this fighting?

09:13.750 --> 09:15.969
-Yeah.
-Yeah. It's making me tense.

09:16.020 --> 09:18.318
Oh. This will help.

09:18.350 --> 09:20.990
It's just so sad.

09:21.020 --> 09:24.979
This house used to be
such a happy place.

09:25.030 --> 09:27.658
Since the day we moved in,
everyone was always laughing.

09:28.860 --> 09:32.831
There's so many
great memories here.

09:32.870 --> 09:37.205
Like the time
Mom and Dad got us Baboo.

09:37.240 --> 09:40.232
Even when I was sick...

09:40.280 --> 09:42.100
I just felt safe here.

09:43.910 --> 09:48.120
And now here we are,
saying goodbye.

09:48.150 --> 09:49.140
What happened to Baboo?

09:49.180 --> 09:50.944
Oh, he ran away.

09:50.990 --> 09:53.084
You can't really blame him.

09:53.120 --> 09:54.952
I can't believe we're
putting stuff in boxes.

09:54.990 --> 09:57.755
It just feels like
it's ending too quickly.

09:57.790 --> 09:59.724
Peter:
You're absolutely right.

09:59.760 --> 10:01.956
We're not taking this
insulting offer.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.664
Thank you for keeping me
from making a huge mistake,

10:05.700 --> 10:07.236
Stella.

10:07.270 --> 10:12.709
<i>* Xk</i>

10:12.740 --> 10:14.879
Nice work, me.

10:17.080 --> 10:19.174
Hey, don't be so hard
on yourself,

10:19.210 --> 10:22.373
You weren't trying to make
everything worse.

10:22.420 --> 10:23.910
Thanks.

10:23.950 --> 10:24.815
Hey.

10:24.850 --> 10:26.113
No, I'm mad at you.

10:26.150 --> 10:28.653
Why? Because you're
avoiding Marlene.

10:28.690 --> 10:30.419
You can't live in
a virtual world forever.

10:30.460 --> 10:31.723
Sure I can.

10:31.760 --> 10:32.921
I have a lot of friends
in here.

10:32.960 --> 10:34.121
I have a great job
shooting demons.

10:34.160 --> 10:36.219
- And these are
noise-canceling headphones,

10:36.260 --> 10:38.866
so they block out whatever
I don't want to hear.

10:38.900 --> 10:40.299
If you didn't want
to be a dad,

10:40.340 --> 10:42.092
you shouldn't have had
unprotected sex a married lady.

10:42.140 --> 10:44.336
She thought she was
on birth control. What?

10:44.370 --> 10:47.010
How could she think that
she was on birth control?

10:47.040 --> 10:49.702
That part is unclear.
You now what?

10:49.750 --> 10:53.072
I have always
defended you, Aiden.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.248
Even when Dad says,
"He is a lost cause,"

10:55.280 --> 10:57.783
I say, "No, he's not.
I believe in him.

10:57.820 --> 10:59.288
He will find his way."

10:59.320 --> 11:01.288
Thanks, sis.

11:01.320 --> 11:02.412
I'll get there some day.

11:02.460 --> 11:04.929
No!
Some day is now, Aiden.

11:04.960 --> 11:07.429
You're my big brother.

11:07.460 --> 11:09.895
It would seriously
break my heart

11:09.930 --> 11:11.819
if I couldn't look
up to you anymore.

11:11.870 --> 11:12.996
Yeah, you look up to me?

11:13.040 --> 11:14.735
I do.

11:14.770 --> 11:17.762
So don't let me down.

11:17.810 --> 11:19.733
Just face this.

11:19.780 --> 11:22.943
Just like
I had to face cancer.

11:22.980 --> 11:26.439
Hey, I'm gonna tell you the
exact same thing you told me --

11:26.480 --> 11:28.949
"You are stronger
than you know."

11:32.150 --> 11:33.083
Oh.

11:33.120 --> 11:34.281
Oh, crap.

11:37.190 --> 11:39.284
I am so sorry.

11:39.330 --> 11:41.958
I left work early to go
pack up my childhood,

11:42.000 --> 11:43.729
and then I got really sad,

11:43.770 --> 11:47.070
so I told Diego this story that
made my dad tear up the offer.

11:47.100 --> 11:49.967
So between the look my mom gave
me and Aiden's baby-mama drama,

11:50.010 --> 11:51.364
I just got caught up.

11:51.410 --> 11:54.835
And I know that a unicorn
lamp can't fix anything,

11:54.880 --> 11:57.099
but I wish that it could.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.470
Well, that clears
everything up.

11:58.510 --> 12:00.069
Really?
Not at all.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.316
I have never heard so many words
have so little meaning.

12:02.350 --> 12:05.479
I know it might seem like I'm
putting my family stuff first.

12:05.520 --> 12:07.079
Does it seem like that,

12:07.120 --> 12:09.760
or is that exactly
what you're doing?

12:09.790 --> 12:12.896
It's what I was doing.

12:12.930 --> 12:13.897
And I'm really sorry.

12:13.930 --> 12:16.149
This is my priority.

12:16.200 --> 12:18.089
You are my priority.

12:18.130 --> 12:19.962
And just to show you
how much I care,

12:20.000 --> 12:24.233
I am going to make us your
favorite dinner while we work.

12:24.270 --> 12:26.204
What is
your favorite dinner?

12:26.240 --> 12:28.072
See, this is why we have
to study for this interview,

12:28.110 --> 12:30.272
because they're gonna
ask us stuff like that.

12:30.310 --> 12:32.347
I know.

12:32.380 --> 12:33.518
Bangers and mash.

12:33.550 --> 12:36.019
Ooh.
That sounds naughty.

12:37.820 --> 12:40.187
Get your flashcards.
Follow me.

12:40.220 --> 12:41.051
Let's do this.

12:41.090 --> 12:43.787
* You're the only
one worth seeing *

12:43.830 --> 12:45.525
* The only place
worth being *

12:45.560 --> 12:49.793
* The only bed worth sleeping
is the one right next to you *

12:49.830 --> 12:52.197
* You're the only
one worth seeing *

12:52.230 --> 12:54.267
* The only place worth being

12:54.300 --> 12:58.407
* The only bed worth sleeping
is the one right next to you *

12:58.440 --> 13:02.843
* Whoa-a-a-a, oh

13:02.880 --> 13:07.875
* Whoa-a-a-a, oh

13:07.920 --> 13:11.140
- We still have so much
information to get through.

13:11.190 --> 13:14.956
Okay,
let's just keep going.

13:14.990 --> 13:17.186
How many people
have you slept with?

13:17.230 --> 13:18.880
What?
Why do I need to know that?

13:18.930 --> 13:22.150
It was one of the questions
I found on the website.

13:22.200 --> 13:24.168
Okay. Yep.

13:24.200 --> 13:26.020
All right,
bracing myself.

13:28.540 --> 13:30.167
Let's hear it.

13:30.210 --> 13:36.843
<i>* Xk</i>

13:36.880 --> 13:38.245
Oh, two.

13:38.280 --> 13:39.600
That's not so bad.

13:39.650 --> 13:41.209
Oh.
No, it's an 11.

13:41.250 --> 13:44.117
Holy crap,
were you a prostitute?

13:44.150 --> 13:44.946
I'm sorry.

13:44.990 --> 13:48.358
This is how
I should've reacted --

13:48.390 --> 13:50.859
That is great information.

13:50.890 --> 13:53.097
Very cool.
That's really good to know.

13:53.130 --> 13:55.599
So you're okay?
Am I thrilled? No.

13:55.630 --> 13:57.359
Is 11 my new least
favorite number?

13:57.400 --> 13:58.595
Absolutely.

13:58.630 --> 14:00.997
But you're a really
good-looking guy.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.929
It makes sense.

14:02.970 --> 14:06.463
Good for you, bro.

14:06.510 --> 14:08.035
I'm fine.
I promise.

14:08.080 --> 14:10.469
Calm down, Stella,
it's just sex, not love.

14:10.510 --> 14:12.547
Love is all that matters.

14:12.580 --> 14:14.014
Okay,
so what about about you?

14:14.050 --> 14:17.384
What's your number?

14:20.120 --> 14:23.488
It was just you, Wes.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.020
Really?

14:28.930 --> 14:31.069
Why didn't you tell me
that in Paris?

14:31.100 --> 14:32.397
Because "I'm a virgin"

14:32.430 --> 14:35.161
is not really something
that you say in Paris.

14:36.670 --> 14:41.335
It's not like I was saving
myself -- it's just that...

14:41.380 --> 14:43.144
I don't know, I never really
had the opportunity.

14:43.180 --> 14:46.639
I was sick since I was 15.

14:46.680 --> 14:49.217
Well...

14:49.250 --> 14:50.081
I'm honored.

14:52.190 --> 14:56.081
<i>* Xk</i>

14:56.120 --> 14:58.282
Okay, let's just stop
for tonight.

14:58.330 --> 15:01.220
No, no, wait.
Let's do one more.

15:01.260 --> 15:03.069
Uh...

15:03.100 --> 15:06.468
Where did I got
to secondary school?

15:06.500 --> 15:08.992
I...

15:09.040 --> 15:11.008
do not know what that is.

15:11.040 --> 15:14.601
In London, secondary
school is high school.

15:14.640 --> 15:16.631
Yes,
Wes explained that to me.

15:16.680 --> 15:18.000
Mapelthorpe Academy.

15:18.050 --> 15:19.245
Correct.

15:19.280 --> 15:21.977
I know. _
Because we really are married.

15:22.020 --> 15:24.148
Speaking of marriage,
why did your parents split up?

15:24.190 --> 15:26.613
Oh, I know this one.
It was because of Stella.

15:26.650 --> 15:27.549
It was all her fault.

15:27.590 --> 15:28.682
Hey, that's not true.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.381
Yes, it is.

15:30.430 --> 15:33.092
It's also your fault your father
won't sell the house.

15:33.130 --> 15:34.427
-No!
-Yes.

15:34.460 --> 15:36.690
And you told me to face up
to being a father.

15:36.730 --> 15:39.961
Now my face
is my father's.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.662
Boo!

15:42.700 --> 15:44.429
Boo?
Hm?

15:44.470 --> 15:47.030
I think you fell asleep
sitting up.

15:47.080 --> 15:50.243
Oh, my brain is fried.

15:50.280 --> 15:52.544
You know what?
Maybe we should call a lawyer.

15:52.580 --> 15:54.173
Already made an appointment
for today,

15:54.220 --> 15:56.143
so can you get off work?

15:56.180 --> 16:00.060
Uh...I don't think so.

16:00.090 --> 16:01.751
Being a real person sucks.

16:01.790 --> 16:03.224
It's fine.
I can handle it.

16:03.260 --> 16:05.479
It's just, I think
we should have a talk

16:05.530 --> 16:07.089
about what we would do

16:07.130 --> 16:08.996
if I do have to
go back to London.

16:09.030 --> 16:10.464
You'd come with me,
right?

16:10.500 --> 16:15.734
<i>* Xk</i>

16:15.770 --> 16:19.229
Yes, of course.
100%.

16:20.610 --> 16:24.046
I will
be right there with ya, gov'nah.

16:24.080 --> 16:27.516
That's, uh,
a very accurate accent.

16:27.550 --> 16:29.746
Thank you, mist'ah.

16:29.780 --> 16:30.679
Okay,
I'm gonna stop that.

16:30.720 --> 16:31.744
I'd appreciate that.

16:31.790 --> 16:36.250
<i>* Xk</i>

16:36.290 --> 16:38.725
Stella: It's real crazy.
Jasper: It is crazy.

16:38.760 --> 16:40.489
Yeah.

16:40.530 --> 16:42.749
It's like you're
begging me to fire you.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.268
Why?
I didn't do anything wrong.

16:44.300 --> 16:45.768
I saw you sneak out
early yesterday,

16:45.800 --> 16:48.167
and now you're torturing this
customer with your family drama.

16:48.200 --> 16:49.429
No, I am not --

16:49.470 --> 16:50.801
If you can tell me
about her personal life,

16:50.840 --> 16:52.239
you get a month
of free coffee.

16:52.270 --> 16:53.340
Her mother and father
are fighting

16:53.380 --> 16:54.575
over selling
the family house.

16:54.610 --> 16:56.237
Her brother knocked up
a married lady.

16:56.280 --> 16:57.543
And she feels terrible
because her husband's

16:57.580 --> 16:59.742
at an immigration
lawyer's office. Alone.

16:59.780 --> 17:01.544
I thought we bonded,
Jasper.

17:01.580 --> 17:03.617
I'd like six free lattes
to go, please.

17:03.650 --> 17:08.416
Okay, I may let my home life
bleed into my work life.

17:08.460 --> 17:09.279
But...

17:09.319 --> 17:12.529
this has been
a really hard week for me.

17:12.560 --> 17:15.790
Fine. But you're totally
on probation.

17:15.829 --> 17:16.729
Hi, Stell Belle.

17:16.760 --> 17:18.762
Hi, Daddy.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.733
I'll make sure
he buys something.

17:20.770 --> 17:22.829
I'll take a latte.

17:22.869 --> 17:24.359
Thank you.

17:24.410 --> 17:25.763
Actually, can we make it
a black coffee?

17:25.810 --> 17:27.107
It's a lot easier
to make.

17:27.140 --> 17:28.471
Anything for you.

17:28.510 --> 17:29.477
Great.

17:29.510 --> 17:31.569
On that...

17:31.610 --> 17:33.544
Mom is freaking out.

17:33.580 --> 17:35.776
Can you reconsider
accepting the offer?

17:35.820 --> 17:37.345
But you said so
yourself --

17:37.390 --> 17:40.189
the house is worth more
than they're willing to pay.

17:40.220 --> 17:42.518
That's not exactly
what I said.

17:42.560 --> 17:44.528
Plus, you guys could
really use the money.

17:44.560 --> 17:47.200
But there are other ways
we can do it.

17:47.230 --> 17:49.653
We could rent it
to cover the mortgage.

17:49.700 --> 17:52.522
At the very least, it would give
me some time to do some upgrades

17:52.570 --> 17:55.335
SO we can get
the price we ask for.

17:55.370 --> 17:59.238
Honey, I know --
I'm too attached to that house.

17:59.270 --> 18:03.173
But part of me feels like
if we sell it,

18:03.210 --> 18:07.579
we're selling all the memories
we have in it.

18:07.620 --> 18:08.610
I know it's crazy.

18:08.650 --> 18:11.517
No, it's not.

18:11.550 --> 18:14.110
I feel that way too.

18:14.160 --> 18:16.219
Then let me
buy us some time.

18:16.260 --> 18:18.183
My dad was making sense.

18:18.230 --> 18:19.755
Mom would have to
respect him for that.

18:19.790 --> 18:22.430
That is great.
Just wonderful.

18:22.460 --> 18:23.461
Or not.

18:23.500 --> 18:25.423
I didn't know where
she was going,

18:25.470 --> 18:28.132
but hopefully it was to take
a walk and calm down.

18:29.800 --> 18:31.461
Uh-oh.

18:31.510 --> 18:33.729
What is wrong with slowing down
and doing some upgrades

18:33.780 --> 18:35.134
so we can get more money?

18:35.180 --> 18:37.148
No, I think it's great.

18:37.180 --> 18:38.545
And since we can't afford
to hire someone,

18:38.580 --> 18:41.743
we can just do
the remodel ourselves.

18:41.780 --> 18:44.181
_ I love
a nice open floor plan.

18:49.720 --> 18:52.223
Stella: Mom!

18:52.260 --> 18:54.297
Mom!
Wha-- Stop!

18:54.330 --> 18:55.752
What is wrong with you?

18:55.800 --> 18:56.892
Nothing's wrong with me.

18:56.930 --> 18:58.659
I feel great.

18:58.700 --> 19:00.236
Oh, hey. Peter.

19:00.270 --> 19:02.238
How do you feel about
a nice set of French doors?

19:02.270 --> 19:03.908
So,
it's finally happened.

19:03.940 --> 19:05.499
You've finally
lost your mind.

19:05.540 --> 19:08.578
Yeah.
Makes me feel like an animal.

19:08.610 --> 19:10.248
Ah!

19:10.280 --> 19:11.350
How's it make you feel?

19:11.380 --> 19:12.745
A little turned on.

19:12.780 --> 19:14.817
Which is annoying.

19:14.850 --> 19:17.615
Mom! Just stop.
Please.

19:17.650 --> 19:19.448
After this, I think
I'm gonna grab a shovel

19:19.490 --> 19:21.413
and put that pool in
that we've always wanted.

19:21.460 --> 19:24.350
First you destroy our family,
now you destroy our home.

19:24.390 --> 19:26.825
Why do you care so much
about this?

19:26.860 --> 19:28.328
It's just a house.

19:28.360 --> 19:31.330
This isn't just a house.
Look.

19:31.370 --> 19:32.724
You are destroying the wall

19:32.770 --> 19:34.932
where we marked our heights
on when we were Kids.

19:34.970 --> 19:36.790
Oh.

19:36.840 --> 19:38.365
Well, I'm sorry, sweetie.

19:38.410 --> 19:39.935
Are you? Because it doesn't
seem like you are.

19:39.970 --> 19:41.369
It seems like you
couldn't care less.

19:41.410 --> 19:43.344
You sound
just like your father.

19:43.380 --> 19:45.439
Are you
on his side now?

19:47.620 --> 19:49.543
I'm trying to be there
for the both of you.

19:49.580 --> 19:51.344
I don't want to choose sides.

19:51.390 --> 19:53.586
Welcome to being
an adult child of divorce.

19:53.620 --> 19:56.282
Fine, you want me
to choose sides?

19:56.320 --> 19:57.424
I'm taking Dad's.

19:57.460 --> 20:00.327
And I'm taking this.

20:02.730 --> 20:04.289
Are you enjoying this?

20:04.330 --> 20:05.820
A little bit.

20:05.870 --> 20:10.569
<i>* Xk</i>

20:10.610 --> 20:12.965
Why would you tip him?
We didn't even get anything.

20:13.010 --> 20:18.278
As a fellow barista, I feel his
pain, so I tip them all.

20:18.310 --> 20:20.642
So, it sounds like Mom
is really losing it.

20:20.680 --> 20:23.388
How long have Mom and Dad been
torturing each other like this?

20:23.420 --> 20:26.014
Let's see,
today's Thursday, so...

20:26.050 --> 20:27.358
three years.

20:27.390 --> 20:28.585
And this is
the kind of stuff

20:28.620 --> 20:30.725
you guys have been
protecting me from?

20:30.760 --> 20:32.455
Usually it's worse.

20:32.490 --> 20:35.721
Between Mom and Dad and all
this immigration stuff with Wes,

20:35.760 --> 20:37.762
life is a lot more complicated
than it used to be.

20:37.800 --> 20:39.723
I think I liked it better
when you guys lied to me.

20:39.770 --> 20:41.329
Do you think we could
go back to that?

20:41.370 --> 20:42.929
Oh, no problem, sis.
Yeah, whatever you need.

20:42.970 --> 20:44.529
Great.

20:44.570 --> 20:46.299
Do you think that Mom and Dad
will ever get along?

20:46.340 --> 20:48.001
Oh, definitely.

20:48.040 --> 20:49.530
There are probably
somewhere being nice

20:49.580 --> 20:51.275
to each other right now.
See?

20:51.310 --> 20:53.415
This is so much better
than the truth.

20:53.450 --> 20:55.339
Speaking of which,
how's your writing going?

20:55.380 --> 20:56.916
Amazing.

20:56.950 --> 20:58.418
Yeah,
that does feel better.

20:58.450 --> 21:00.009
Wait. We lost Aiden.

21:00.050 --> 21:01.757
There is no way
that's true.

21:01.790 --> 21:04.782
Okay, you got me, I'm not
the official parker greeter.

21:04.830 --> 21:07.754
But I would like to take
this opportunity to say hello

21:07.800 --> 21:10.599
and welcome to the park.

21:10.630 --> 21:11.995
Aiden.

21:12.030 --> 21:15.637
Ah, sorry, babe.

21:15.670 --> 21:18.935
New rule -- you are not allowed
to talk to any women

21:18.970 --> 21:21.337
until you talk to the one
who is carrying your baby.

21:21.380 --> 21:23.747
I'm going right from here
to meet her.

21:23.780 --> 21:25.339
And what's your plan?

21:25.380 --> 21:27.041
How are you
gonna handle that?

21:27.080 --> 21:29.071
I'm gonna take
a deep breath and say,

21:29.120 --> 21:30.610
"How can I help you
through this?"

21:30.650 --> 21:33.358
And then I'm gonna do
a whole lot of listening.

21:33.390 --> 21:34.585
I got this!

21:34.620 --> 21:36.019
Better late than never.

21:36.060 --> 21:39.360
That would be an awesome title
for my autobiography.

21:39.390 --> 21:40.926
Guys, I was just texting
with Diego.

21:40.960 --> 21:42.621
Dad asked him to go over
to the house and help

21:42.660 --> 21:44.025
with the destruction
Mom caused.

21:44.070 --> 21:45.560
-Eugh.
-Yeah.

21:45.600 --> 21:47.694
One of us should go by later
and check on Diego.

21:47.740 --> 21:51.461
Yeah, I -- Why are
your fingers on your noses?

21:51.510 --> 21:53.376
Guys, that's not fair.

21:53.410 --> 21:54.809
See you, sis.

21:54.840 --> 21:55.875
Seriously?

21:55.910 --> 21:57.969
You should go check on Diego --
he's your husband.

21:58.010 --> 21:59.546
I get that, but...

21:59.580 --> 22:02.311
unfortunately
my finger's on my nose.

22:04.690 --> 22:07.387
I hate to say it, but at this
point, it may be easier

22:07.420 --> 22:10.117
to just finish
taking out the wall.

22:10.160 --> 22:12.629
Yeah, she really did
some damage here.

22:12.660 --> 22:14.424
Mom did some damage
to the yard too.

22:14.460 --> 22:16.098
There's some holes
in random places.

22:16.130 --> 22:18.770
Not really
a pool shape yet.

22:18.800 --> 22:20.495
Wonderful.
Hey.

22:20.540 --> 22:21.689
It's all good.

22:21.740 --> 22:23.469
We're here.
-I'm here too, Dad.

22:23.510 --> 22:25.604
You could've asked me
to help you fix stuff.

22:25.640 --> 22:27.972
You're not the guy
who fixes problems, Aiden.

22:28.010 --> 22:28.932
You cause them.

22:28.980 --> 22:30.573
Don't be so hard on him.

22:30.610 --> 22:31.873
Aiden and I talked,

22:31.910 --> 22:34.675
and he is gonna be making
some big old changes.

22:34.720 --> 22:38.145
Look, I admit I made some bad
decisions in the past, for sure,

22:38.190 --> 22:40.010
but I'm moving forward,
and I'd appreciate it

22:40.050 --> 22:43.111
if you gave me the benefit
of the doubt once in a while.

22:43.160 --> 22:45.629
Have you seen
my --

22:45.660 --> 22:47.128
This is not a good time,
Denise.

22:47.160 --> 22:48.127
Seriously, Aiden?

22:48.160 --> 22:49.889
It's not what it looks like.

22:49.930 --> 22:52.422
I mean, it's obviously
pretty close.

22:52.470 --> 22:53.835
Diego.

22:53.870 --> 22:54.439
Denise.

22:54.470 --> 22:55.869
You guys know each other?

22:55.900 --> 22:57.902
Yeah, yeah.
Our kids are in school together.

22:57.940 --> 23:01.137
Hey, and say hi
to your husband for me.

23:01.180 --> 23:03.444
Uh, don't do that.
That's weird.

23:03.480 --> 23:06.450
Have you even talked
to Marlene yet?

23:09.650 --> 23:10.742
You know what? No.

23:10.790 --> 23:12.542
I am so done defending you.

23:12.590 --> 23:14.809
I can't believe I ever
thought you'd change.

23:16.860 --> 23:18.521
S-Stella...

23:21.560 --> 23:23.870
Great job. You lost
the one person on your side.

23:23.900 --> 23:26.164
How can you keep making
the same mistakes over and over?

23:26.200 --> 23:28.589
I don't have to explain
myself to you.

23:28.640 --> 23:30.199
As long as I'm putting
a roof over your head,

23:30.240 --> 23:31.901
you sure as hell do.

23:31.940 --> 23:33.738
Hey, Dad, don't worry
about the mess over here.

23:33.780 --> 23:34.906
I got it.

23:34.940 --> 23:37.477
Isn't he great?

23:37.510 --> 23:40.150
Hey. How did it go
with the lawyer?

23:40.180 --> 23:41.545
Not great.

23:41.580 --> 23:42.718
He reckons we might have
to go back to London

23:42.750 --> 23:43.911
till we can get
this sorted out.

23:43.950 --> 23:44.917
We?

23:44.950 --> 23:47.590
I can't believe my family
is falling apart,

23:47.620 --> 23:49.213
and they're trying to send us
halfway across the world

23:49.260 --> 23:51.649
because of some
stupid paperwork?

23:51.690 --> 23:53.226
I mean, it was
an honest mistake.

23:53.260 --> 23:57.197
We thought I was gonna die.

23:57.230 --> 23:58.664
I'm making this go away.

23:58.700 --> 24:00.589
How are you planning
to do that?

24:00.640 --> 24:02.734
I knew
who I needed to talk to.

24:02.770 --> 24:05.102
So, you see,
when we got married,

24:05.140 --> 24:06.665
we thought I was dying.

24:06.710 --> 24:09.600
It was like one of those
romantic cancer movies,

24:09.640 --> 24:12.849
where boy meets girl,
and they fall in love...

24:14.720 --> 24:15.949
...the way only two people

24:15.980 --> 24:18.779
with nothing else
to do truly can.

24:21.260 --> 24:23.752
All right, stop.
Just stop.

24:23.790 --> 24:25.827
You married a man you knew
for less than a month,

24:25.860 --> 24:27.828
and he knew
you were gonna die?

24:27.860 --> 24:30.090
Why are you saying
that like it's bad?

24:30.130 --> 24:32.690
Because he was gonna marry you,
become a citizen,

24:32.730 --> 24:36.064
and then
you were gonna die.

24:36.100 --> 24:39.809
Oh.
Okay, now I see why.

24:39.840 --> 24:41.035
Let me ask you
a question --

24:41.080 --> 24:43.947
What kind of person
marries a dying girl?

24:43.980 --> 24:45.573
I know what you are
trying to do.

24:45.610 --> 24:47.009
You are trying to
put doubts in my head,

24:47.050 --> 24:49.917
but you can't,
because I know him.

24:49.950 --> 24:52.009
I know him.

24:52.050 --> 24:54.519
I believe you fell in love
with Mr. Charles,

24:54.560 --> 24:56.654
but people
can be deceptive.

24:56.690 --> 24:58.180
You don't get it.

24:58.230 --> 25:02.758
I know that this might sound
a little cheesy, but...

25:02.800 --> 25:05.189
I really believe that fate,

25:05.230 --> 25:07.267
or whatever
you want to call it,

25:07.300 --> 25:08.859
brought us together.

25:08.900 --> 25:12.962
We are each other's
first loves.

25:13.010 --> 25:14.603
That I am certain of.

25:14.640 --> 25:16.631
So the woman he shared
a one-bedroom flat

25:16.680 --> 25:18.569
with in London
for two years...

25:18.610 --> 25:21.045
a Pippa Hollingsworth...

25:21.080 --> 25:22.616
was just a friend?

25:22.650 --> 25:26.917
I bet he slept on
an air mattress there, too.

25:26.950 --> 25:31.285
You did know about her,
didn't you?

25:31.330 --> 25:33.025
Of course I did.

25:33.060 --> 25:35.529
Like I said, I know him.

25:40.100 --> 25:41.090
Pippa?

25:41.140 --> 25:42.960
Who's Pippa, Wes?

25:43.000 --> 25:44.900
You made me feel
like such an idiot.

25:44.940 --> 25:46.669
Okay, look. Can we just talk
about this later, please?

25:46.710 --> 25:47.973
Now is not a good time.
Why not?

25:48.010 --> 25:50.035
Because your mother
is here.

25:52.180 --> 25:53.841
Hi.

25:53.880 --> 25:56.679
I tried calling you, but you
weren't picking up the phone.

25:56.720 --> 25:58.643
Because I don't want
to talk to you.

25:58.690 --> 26:01.057
Honey, I am so sorry
I made you choose sides.

26:01.090 --> 26:02.649
Seeing you take
your father's side

26:02.690 --> 26:06.149
- made me realize
it was a big mistake.

26:06.190 --> 26:08.056
I can't deal with either
of you right now.

26:08.100 --> 26:09.920
I'll be in the bath.

26:09.960 --> 26:12.725
Is marriage
always this hard?

26:12.770 --> 26:15.592
You're really
asking me that?

26:15.640 --> 26:18.735
Aiden: I miss Mom buying
groceries. I'm starving.

26:18.770 --> 26:21.171
You want the pepper
or the chocolate?

26:23.080 --> 26:24.047
Yeah.

26:25.810 --> 26:29.075
You could've taken a little time
out of your empty schedule

26:29.120 --> 26:30.918
to go shopping for us.

26:30.950 --> 26:33.988
You know, could you just
hold that thought?

26:34.020 --> 26:37.058
I kinda like it when you call me
a disappointment over dessert.

26:37.090 --> 26:40.185
How could I not be
disappointed, Aiden?

26:40.230 --> 26:44.622
You're a smart kid, but you
dropped out of college,

26:44.670 --> 26:45.694
do nothing all day...

26:45.730 --> 26:49.769
Well,
today I did a soccer mom.

26:49.800 --> 26:51.632
Is this a joke to you?

26:51.670 --> 26:53.206
This is your life.

26:53.240 --> 26:54.378
You only get one.

26:54.410 --> 26:56.105
And you're throwing it
away.

26:56.140 --> 26:59.303
I'm doing the best I can
with the hand I was dealt.

26:59.350 --> 27:01.978
The hand you were dealt?

27:02.020 --> 27:05.115
You come from an educated,
upper-middle-class, white family

27:05.150 --> 27:06.982
in suburban Oregon.

27:07.020 --> 27:09.159
I gave you everything
you could ever want.

27:09.190 --> 27:10.726
Your money?

27:10.760 --> 27:12.979
Sure.
Never the time of day.

27:13.030 --> 27:16.989
Stella was sick.
I know.

27:17.030 --> 27:19.021
That meant
I was invisible.

27:22.400 --> 27:27.133
Look, I know you had
a lot going on,

27:27.170 --> 27:29.002
but would it have killed you
to put your hand on my shoulder

27:29.040 --> 27:31.873
just one time and tell me
that you believed in me?

27:31.910 --> 27:35.949
I did the best I could --
With the hand you were dealt?

27:35.980 --> 27:41.316
<i>* Xk</i>

27:41.360 --> 27:47.049

27:47.090 --> 27:48.353
How was your bath?

27:48.400 --> 27:51.222
Long.
Crappy.

27:51.270 --> 27:54.433
I feel like a sad raisin.

27:54.470 --> 27:55.892
Your mom left.

27:55.940 --> 27:58.307
Did you love her?

27:58.340 --> 28:01.970
Pippa --
Did you love her?

28:02.010 --> 28:03.705
Yes.

28:03.750 --> 28:07.277
Then why did you tell me that
you'd never been in love before?

28:07.310 --> 28:10.439
Because you were dying.
No. No, don't do that.

28:10.480 --> 28:13.950
Don't use my cancer as
your get-out-of-jail-free card.

28:13.990 --> 28:16.857
I'm so sick
of people doing that.

28:16.890 --> 28:19.928
I love you,
and I wanted you

28:19.960 --> 28:22.952
to have the romance
that you dreamt about.

28:23.000 --> 28:28.461
So I told you what I thought
you wanted to hear.

28:28.500 --> 28:30.366
And when I got better?

28:30.400 --> 28:31.799
I don't know.

28:31.840 --> 28:34.207
I didn't know how
to tell the truth.

28:34.240 --> 28:38.871
I didn't want to stop being
the perfect man in your movie.

28:38.910 --> 28:42.210
Well,
the movie's over now.

28:42.250 --> 28:44.287
And it turns out it's not
as good as you thought,

28:44.320 --> 28:47.449
because there are some --
some really big plot holes

28:47.490 --> 28:49.117
that need to be explained.

28:49.160 --> 28:52.983
Like what? Like what kind of
person marries a dying girl?

28:53.030 --> 28:57.490
If you don't already know
the answer to that question,

28:57.530 --> 28:59.066
maybe they're right.

28:59.100 --> 29:02.730
Maybe -- Maybe our marriage
isn't as real as we thought.

29:05.210 --> 29:06.063
Do you know what?

29:06.110 --> 29:08.033
If honesty really is
that important to you,

29:08.080 --> 29:09.502
were you being
totally honest with me

29:09.540 --> 29:11.144
when you said
you'd move to London?

29:13.550 --> 29:15.871
Yeah, I didn't think so.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.946
You were just as unprepared
for you to live as I was.

29:18.990 --> 29:21.960
But now that we have a shot
at a real future together,

29:21.990 --> 29:23.981
you're the one having
doubts about us, not me.

29:24.030 --> 29:25.953
That's not true.
Really?

29:25.990 --> 29:29.119
Because you will not put
our marriage before your family.

29:29.160 --> 29:30.230
I shouldn't have to.

29:30.260 --> 29:32.228
Of course you shouldn't.

29:32.270 --> 29:35.570
But if I get deported, you're
gonna have to make a choice.

29:35.600 --> 29:37.967
And knowing that
you wouldn't choose me --

29:38.010 --> 29:39.865
I didn't say that
I wouldn't choose you.

29:39.910 --> 29:42.538
But you didn't say
that you would.

29:42.580 --> 29:50.580
<i>* Xk</i>

29:51.150 --> 29:59.150
<i>* Xk</i>

30:02.530 --> 30:09.163
<i>* Xk</i>

30:09.200 --> 30:11.032
I wanted to fix things
with Wes,

30:11.070 --> 30:13.209
but I didn't know how.

30:13.240 --> 30:16.039
So I tried to get off
the air mattress quietly...

30:19.580 --> 30:25.087
<i>* Xk</i>

30:25.120 --> 30:29.011
...and went to the one person
I knew in a perfect marriage.

30:29.060 --> 30:31.119
Basically, I get
how Harry met Sally,

30:31.160 --> 30:33.549
but what happened
after Harry married Sally?

30:33.590 --> 30:36.025
Oh. They fought.

30:36.060 --> 30:38.597
And sometimes Harry regretted
having kids so early,

30:38.630 --> 30:42.430
and other times Sally would look
at the men in her pilates class

30:42.470 --> 30:46.100
and think, "Ooh,
I'd like some of that."

30:46.140 --> 30:48.472
I feel like we're not talking
about a movie anymore.

30:48.510 --> 30:51.343
We're not. I'm sorry,
Diego keeps texting me

30:51.380 --> 30:53.917
about what kind of cereal
to feed the twins.

30:53.950 --> 30:55.349
Just pick one.

30:55.380 --> 30:58.486
Look, marriage isn't about
being happy all the time.

30:58.520 --> 31:00.079
I feel like if you're
struggling a little bit,

31:00.120 --> 31:01.610
it means you're probably
doing it right.

31:01.660 --> 31:04.083
Then why does it feel
like I'm doing it wrong?

31:04.130 --> 31:05.620
Because you're new at it.

31:05.660 --> 31:07.219
And because you're young.

31:07.260 --> 31:11.561
I mean, most people your age
are single and selfish.

31:11.600 --> 31:14.092
They're Aiden.

31:14.140 --> 31:16.529
I think if you wake up
in the morning

31:16.570 --> 31:20.973
and you feel like,
today this is worth it...

31:21.010 --> 31:23.399
that's what happiness is.

31:23.440 --> 31:26.501
And the day you don't...

31:26.550 --> 31:29.144
Stella, you just got
your life handed back to you.

31:29.180 --> 31:31.979
Wes is great.
But you don't have kids yet.

31:32.020 --> 31:34.284
I mean, nobody would blame you
if you decided

31:34.320 --> 31:37.483
that you weren't ready
for a life-long commitment.

31:40.190 --> 31:43.399
Okay, now you're just
being greedy.

31:43.430 --> 31:49.665
<i>* Xk</i>

31:49.700 --> 31:53.409
I was hoping dinner
would be quick and painless.

31:53.440 --> 31:55.306
Would you like
the lamb chops, Ida?

31:55.340 --> 31:57.570
Or are you a strict
vegetarian now?

31:57.610 --> 31:59.339
No luck.

31:59.380 --> 32:01.371
You cannot bear
to see me thrive.

32:01.420 --> 32:02.444
None of you can.

32:02.480 --> 32:03.572
You've all abandoned me.

32:03.620 --> 32:04.985
That is not fair, Mom.

32:05.020 --> 32:06.181
I have been trying
to be there for you,

32:06.220 --> 32:07.540
but you're too busy
sledgehammering

32:07.590 --> 32:09.251
our walls to notice.

32:09.290 --> 32:11.429
I mean, seriously, what kind
of person does that?

32:11.460 --> 32:13.087
That's her new favorite
thing to ask.

32:13.130 --> 32:15.019
Are you guys still
fighting about his ex?

32:15.060 --> 32:17.051
That is
none of your business.

32:17.100 --> 32:19.228
Aiden,
can you pass the salt?

32:19.270 --> 32:22.194
Ooh, sorry, Pops.
It's too heavy.

32:22.240 --> 32:25.699
Diego, would you be the son
my father always wanted

32:25.740 --> 32:27.162
and pass him the salt?

32:27.210 --> 32:29.304
I don't know what
the right move is here.

32:29.340 --> 32:31.001
I don't want to get
in the middle,

32:31.050 --> 32:32.575
but I also don't want
your food to be bland.

32:32.610 --> 32:33.975
Aiden, this is stupid.

32:34.020 --> 32:35.169
What are you two
fighting about now?

32:35.220 --> 32:36.449
Oh, nothing, Mom.
Just keep thriving.

32:36.480 --> 32:39.188
For starters, you're gonna
be a grandmother again.

32:39.220 --> 32:42.053
What?

32:42.090 --> 32:43.410
Elizabeth, why
didn't you tell me?

32:43.460 --> 32:45.986
Oh, God, no.
Mnh-mnh. Snip snip.

32:46.030 --> 32:48.192
The two upstairs
are enough.

32:48.230 --> 32:50.597
Wes?
-Nope.

32:50.630 --> 32:52.325
-Not us.
-I don't understand.

32:52.370 --> 32:55.340
Seriously? Oh, God.
Aiden, what did you do?

32:55.370 --> 32:57.236
I think it's pretty clear
what he did, Mom.

32:57.270 --> 32:59.364
How could you be
so irresponsible?

32:59.410 --> 33:01.105
You're just as bad
as this guy.

33:01.140 --> 33:03.108
I think you are just
displacing your anger, sweetie.

33:03.140 --> 33:05.006
You think that he's
displacing his anger?

33:05.050 --> 33:08.213
Look at what you've done
to our house.

33:08.250 --> 33:10.469
Moving to London's looking
pretty good now, huh?

33:10.520 --> 33:12.614
-We have to discuss it.

33:12.650 --> 33:15.449
She doesn't want to.
But I might get deported.

33:15.490 --> 33:18.357
Deported?
Why didn't you tell me?

33:18.390 --> 33:20.722
Because, Mom, every since
we found out I was gonna live,

33:20.760 --> 33:23.559
you have stopped
caring about my life.

33:23.600 --> 33:25.022
About any of our lives.

33:25.070 --> 33:26.560
All you ever do
is talk about yourself.

33:26.600 --> 33:29.240
I mean, you are so out of here,
and you are so out of touch

33:29.270 --> 33:31.238
with how we're all
feeling about it.

33:32.810 --> 33:34.130
You know what?
Why don't you just

33:34.180 --> 33:35.739
go home to Poppy
and thrive?

33:35.780 --> 33:40.741
<i>* Xk</i>

33:40.780 --> 33:45.786
<i>* Xk</i>

33:45.820 --> 33:49.415
I think
you broke your mom.

33:51.160 --> 33:53.128
Well, on the plus side,

33:53.160 --> 33:55.549
looks like we'll have a pool
by dawn.

33:55.600 --> 34:01.061
<i>* Xk</i>

34:01.100 --> 34:03.831
Mom, this is ridiculous.

34:03.870 --> 34:05.599
We're not gonna put in
a pool.

34:05.640 --> 34:07.233
That is not what I am doing.

34:07.270 --> 34:09.705
I am digging my own grave
since you are all content

34:09.739 --> 34:11.242
to see me die here.

34:11.280 --> 34:13.578
I just don't understand
why you are so desperate

34:13.610 --> 34:14.543
to get rid of this place.

34:14.580 --> 34:16.309
Did it mean nothing to you?

34:16.350 --> 34:19.114
Does this family mean
nothing to you?

34:20.790 --> 34:24.385
Mom, put the shovel down.

34:24.429 --> 34:28.253
It hurts me that you are
walking away without caring.

34:28.300 --> 34:31.224
How is this so easy
for you?

34:31.270 --> 34:32.418
I'm so glad
that you have such

34:32.469 --> 34:33.824
wonderful memories
of this house,

34:33.870 --> 34:36.760
Stella, but my memories
are different than yours.

34:36.800 --> 34:44.800
<i>* Xk</i>

34:46.580 --> 34:50.346
For me, this house
is where my baby got sick.

34:50.380 --> 34:55.112
<i>* Xk</i>

34:55.159 --> 34:58.152
And it's where my love story
fell apart.

35:01.900 --> 35:04.323
And you don't remember this,

35:04.370 --> 35:07.795
but that wall where
we marked your heights...

35:07.830 --> 35:09.332
there is a paint chip
on it

35:09.370 --> 35:11.236
from when we had to bring
in the hospital bed,

35:11.270 --> 35:15.673
because, honey, you couldn't
get up the stairs.

35:18.650 --> 35:22.917
This house is where everything
bad has happened in my life,

35:22.950 --> 35:26.784
and I just want
to let go of it all.

35:26.820 --> 35:27.890
Please, just...

35:27.920 --> 35:30.617
just let me let go.

35:34.430 --> 35:36.421
And at that moment,

35:36.460 --> 35:39.521
<i>we all
finally understood my mom.</i>

35:40.800 --> 35:42.234
What the hell?

35:44.270 --> 35:46.602
Please tell me
that is not a coffin.

35:46.640 --> 35:47.903
It's not a coffin.

35:47.940 --> 35:48.805
Are you lying?

35:48.840 --> 35:49.910
Obviously.

35:49.940 --> 35:52.272
<i>* Xk</i>

35:54.620 --> 35:57.271
Why is there a coffin
in our backyard?

35:57.320 --> 36:00.244
Why's it so small?

36:00.290 --> 36:03.510
Because it's a coffin
for a cat.

36:03.560 --> 36:05.221
It's Baboo.

36:05.260 --> 36:06.625
I don't know understand.

36:06.660 --> 36:08.355
You told me
that Baboo ran away.

36:08.400 --> 36:10.459
'We lied.
Big surprise.

36:10.500 --> 36:13.925
Why would you guys
lie about that?

36:13.970 --> 36:15.267
How did he really die?

36:15.300 --> 36:18.600
He had...cancer.

You okay?

Yeah.

36:55.440 --> 36:57.932
It's just, uh...

36:57.980 --> 37:00.642
I loved that cat.

37:00.680 --> 37:02.739
I took care of him
when he got sick.

37:02.780 --> 37:05.841
I mean, you didn't know that.
But I...

37:05.890 --> 37:08.689
I took
really good care of him.

37:08.720 --> 37:11.724
You took
really good care of me.

37:11.760 --> 37:14.855
And you could be
a great father.

37:14.900 --> 37:16.356
You just...

37:16.400 --> 37:18.562
you have to
believe in yourself,

<i>* Xk</i>

37:24.000 --> 37:27.800
She's right.

37:27.840 --> 37:29.330
Thanks, Dad.

37:32.380 --> 37:33.609
And, Ida,

37:33.650 --> 37:36.540
I wish more than anything
that you wanted to stay.

37:36.580 --> 37:39.550
But I understand
why you have to go.

37:39.590 --> 37:44.357
So let's take the offer
and sell the house.

37:44.390 --> 37:46.859
Right after
we re-bury this cat.

37:46.890 --> 37:52.363
<i>* Xk</i>

37:52.400 --> 37:55.597
So after an impromptu
cat funeral,

37:55.640 --> 37:58.439
we all sat back down around
the old kitchen table

37:58.470 --> 38:00.666
one last time.

38:00.710 --> 38:03.429
<i>* Xk</i>

38:03.480 --> 38:05.642

38:05.680 --> 38:07.648
The next day,
Aiden found the courage

38:07.680 --> 38:09.842
to face fatherhood head on.

38:09.880 --> 38:12.713
_ I'm in.
Anything you need, Marlene.

38:12.750 --> 38:14.855
Okay.

38:14.890 --> 38:17.552
I think we should tell
my husband the truth.

38:17.590 --> 38:20.821
That feels
like a you thing.

38:20.860 --> 38:22.692
-Bye, Mom!
-Bye!

38:22.730 --> 38:24.994
And I helped Lizzie get
into a writer's retreat

38:25.030 --> 38:26.589
so she could finally focus.

38:26.630 --> 38:28.769
Diego: See you, babe!
I got the kids!

38:28.800 --> 38:30.632
You know I'm gonna
kill you, right?

38:30.670 --> 38:34.379
Makes sense.
And as for me and Wes...

38:34.410 --> 38:36.799
What is his favorite meal?

38:36.840 --> 38:38.569
Bangers and mash.

38:38.610 --> 38:39.907
I actually made it
for him last night

38:39.950 --> 38:42.612
when we were
studying for this. Mm.

38:42.650 --> 38:43.913
N--

38:43.950 --> 38:47.045
We weren't -- we didn't
have to study for this.

38:47.090 --> 38:50.685
What is
her favorite holiday?

38:50.720 --> 38:52.085
I...

38:52.130 --> 38:55.452
uh...

38:55.500 --> 38:57.559
I-I don't know what
that face means.

38:57.600 --> 38:58.863
Clearly it means
Christmas.

38:58.900 --> 39:00.459
Christmas?
Yeah.

39:00.500 --> 39:01.968
How is that Christmas?

39:02.000 --> 39:03.695
Jingle bells.

39:03.740 --> 39:05.765
Okay,
what's his shoe size?

39:07.670 --> 39:09.900
I don't know.
And you know what?

39:09.940 --> 39:11.578
It doesn't matter
that I don't know,

39:11.610 --> 39:14.841
because I know that his nose
crinkles when he laughs,

39:14.880 --> 39:15.745
and I know that his eyes,

39:15.780 --> 39:18.488
they get really large
when he's nervous.

39:18.520 --> 39:22.809
And I know
how he makes me feel.

39:22.860 --> 39:25.750
I mean, that's what's
important, right?

39:27.930 --> 39:29.557
All right, look.

39:29.600 --> 39:31.022
I don't know what you're writing
in your little pad, okay?

39:31.060 --> 39:34.439
But the truth is,
I don't care.

39:34.470 --> 39:37.633
Okay, that's a lie.
I do care. I care a lot.

39:37.670 --> 39:41.834
You asked my wife what kind of
person would marry a dying girl.

39:45.050 --> 39:47.747
Well, I'd like to answer.

39:50.480 --> 39:53.415
The kind of person who...

39:53.450 --> 39:57.489
who never knew
how to live for today

39:57.520 --> 40:02.651
_until he fell in love
with an amazing woman,

40:02.700 --> 40:05.920
only to find out that
today was all that she had.

40:05.970 --> 40:09.668
The kind of person who never
felt like a single thing he did

40:09.700 --> 40:12.567
in his life really mattered
until he met her.

40:14.940 --> 40:20.504
Because loving her
in her final days...mattered.

40:20.550 --> 40:22.541
It still matters.

40:22.580 --> 40:27.017
Loving her
makes me matter.

40:27.050 --> 40:31.009
I know it might not be
the fairytale, but...

40:35.630 --> 40:37.553
...but we're meant to be.

40:40.230 --> 40:42.460
And I think that we deserve
a chance to prove that.

40:42.500 --> 40:46.209
Maybe not to you,
but...to each other.

40:46.240 --> 40:52.202
<i>* Xk</i>

40:52.250 --> 40:54.002
I love you.

40:56.080 --> 40:57.844
I love you too.

41:01.520 --> 41:05.127
Welcome to America,
Mr. Charles.

41:05.160 --> 41:06.559
Best of luck
to you both.

41:07.990 --> 41:11.995
* Lovesick the beat
inside my head *

41:13.870 --> 41:17.090
* Waves struck a sea
of bitterness *

41:17.140 --> 41:18.767
You know,
usually I am the one

41:18.810 --> 41:20.960
that's delivering
all of the big speeches.

41:21.010 --> 41:22.205
I feel like I crushed it.

41:22.240 --> 41:24.004
You totally did.

41:26.210 --> 41:30.511
I just want you to know, though,
that if it came down to it...

41:30.550 --> 41:32.814
I would have gone
to London with you.

41:32.850 --> 41:33.988
Really?

41:34.020 --> 41:35.613
Yes.

41:37.020 --> 41:40.524
* And I got love
falling like the rain *

41:40.560 --> 41:43.598
* 1 never could've
asked for more *

41:45.200 --> 41:47.123
* Ever since you came

41:47.170 --> 41:50.538
* I'm living ultralife

41:52.110 --> 42:00.110
