WEBVTT

00:08.631 --> 00:11.024
Oh, good,
we're all here!

00:11.134 --> 00:13.389
So everypony got an urgent
summons to the castle

00:13.477 --> 00:14.871
with no explanation?

00:15.052 --> 00:18.618
Yup! I just love a good
mysterious summons.

00:18.714 --> 00:21.407
What's it about?
Do you think it's a surprise party?

00:21.548 --> 00:22.829
Hey, why are we running?

00:22.917 --> 00:24.813
Because something could
be terribly wrong!

00:24.901 --> 00:26.171
Somepony turned bad,

00:26.259 --> 00:28.290
another evil creature
back for revenge.

00:28.378 --> 00:30.772
Don't you think you're
being a little paranoid?

00:30.860 --> 00:33.796
Why else would the princesses
send scrolls in such a hurry?

00:33.884 --> 00:36.563
Good point. They'd know
better than to make us worry.

00:36.651 --> 00:38.622
Plus, I like it when
you run so fast;

00:38.710 --> 00:40.384
the walls get all blurry.

00:40.950 --> 00:43.134
Wheee! Race ya!

00:48.472 --> 00:51.180
Girls, thank you
so much for coming.

00:51.268 --> 00:52.805
What's wrong?
What can we do?

00:52.893 --> 00:56.843
That's just it. Nothing's
wrong. Everything's perfect!

00:57.095 --> 01:00.657
Did y'all call us down
here just to tell us that?

01:00.745 --> 01:03.032
With all due
respect, Majesties,

01:03.141 --> 01:05.313
you might want to save
your urgent summons

01:05.400 --> 01:08.446
for matters that are a
bit more... well, urgent?

01:10.493 --> 01:12.134
Well, there is more to it.

01:12.258 --> 01:15.288
Equestria is currently
enjoying its longest period

01:15.376 --> 01:17.173
of harmony in recent years.

01:17.261 --> 01:19.910
And it's all thanks
to you, Twilight.

01:20.084 --> 01:21.531
And your
friends, of course.

01:21.751 --> 01:23.333
Who, us?

01:23.516 --> 01:24.595
Oh, pshaw!

01:24.683 --> 01:26.397
It's about time
you noticed!

01:26.485 --> 01:27.868
Thank you.

01:27.956 --> 01:29.095
Because of your efforts,

01:29.183 --> 01:31.266
there' been less
and less for us to do!

01:31.354 --> 01:35.571
So, after much consideration,
my sister and I have decided

01:35.682 --> 01:38.776
it is time for us to retire.

01:41.229 --> 01:44.045
Breaking News!
The royal princesses retiring?

01:44.133 --> 01:45.673
I have so many
questions.

01:45.761 --> 01:47.907
Who'll take over?
Who will run Equestria?

01:47.995 --> 01:49.910
Will it be someone
tall, dark, and handsome

01:49.998 --> 01:52.423
or will it be the
Lord of Chaos?

01:56.124 --> 01:59.227
Ugh. Fine, go with
the obvious choice.

You're retiring?

02:41.313 --> 02:43.609
Princesses can retire!

02:43.733 --> 02:47.021
Of course we can!
I, for one, am looking forward

02:47.109 --> 02:50.438
to a little R&R,
maybe a trip to Silver Shoals.

02:50.539 --> 02:53.156
And you want me to
take your place?

02:53.469 --> 02:54.491
Mm hm!

02:54.578 --> 02:57.086
With the help of your
friends, of course.

03:00.492 --> 03:03.461
We can't think of
anypony more worthy.

03:04.227 --> 03:06.248
Over the years, we've
watched you grow.

03:06.336 --> 03:08.326
You've faced
task after task.

03:08.414 --> 03:09.826
...challenge
after challenge.

03:09.914 --> 03:13.797
...countless adversities.
Yeah, yeah, we get it.

03:13.922 --> 03:15.969
And you've always
prevailed.

03:16.109 --> 03:18.029
Thank you, but that
doesn't mean that I'm...

03:18.117 --> 03:20.734
That we're ready
to do what you do!

03:20.858 --> 03:24.768
Of course you are. I realize
this is a lot to take in, but...

03:24.856 --> 03:28.004
Nope! Makes perfect
sense. We're awesome.

03:28.473 --> 03:30.333
Does this mean we
get all your powers?

03:30.629 --> 03:33.301
I call dibs on showing
up in everypony's dreams!

03:33.449 --> 03:35.565
You can't be ready to step
into their horse shoes

03:35.653 --> 03:36.846
just like that.

03:36.934 --> 03:39.721
Well, if the Princesses
think it's time to retire,

03:39.809 --> 03:41.057
we're not a bad choice.

03:41.145 --> 03:43.588
We always have Equestria's
best interests at heart.

03:43.676 --> 03:45.059
That's a fair point,

03:45.161 --> 03:46.838
which should be taken
into consideration

03:46.926 --> 03:48.012
when we have a
roundtable

03:48.100 --> 03:49.635
- discussion.
- Well, I'm in.

03:49.723 --> 03:52.721
Darlings! We'll all need a
complete wardrobe update.

03:52.809 --> 03:55.652
And I would love to pick your
brain about mane maintenance.

03:55.739 --> 03:57.153
When you have a moment.

03:57.333 --> 04:01.010
As long as we all have each
other, I'm sure we can do it.

04:01.098 --> 04:02.103
Yay!

04:02.191 --> 04:07.129
Protectors of Equestria
on three. One, two...

04:11.755 --> 04:14.671
If you're all on board,
I guess I am too.

04:14.934 --> 04:17.940
Protectors of Equestria!

04:18.457 --> 04:20.048
It'll be a bit of
an adjustment,

04:20.144 --> 04:21.934
but I imagine the
transfer of power

04:22.022 --> 04:23.059
will be a lengthy process

04:23.147 --> 04:25.003
- which will give me...
- Actually, we just need a few days

04:25.090 --> 04:26.997
to put together a
little ceremony.

04:27.128 --> 04:28.918
Heh heh.
A few days?

04:30.372 --> 04:31.816
But... but that's so soon!

04:31.904 --> 04:33.807
Shouldn't there be some
sort of training program?

04:33.894 --> 04:36.575
That lasts weeks, no,
months, if not years?

04:36.786 --> 04:38.674
Everything you've gone
through over the years

04:38.762 --> 04:40.614
has been a
training program.

04:40.778 --> 04:43.198
OK, but there's got to be
a guide or a rule book?

04:43.286 --> 04:44.588
Yes, I have it right here:

04:44.676 --> 04:48.137
"How to Rule Equestria"
by Nopony McPretendsmith.

04:50.145 --> 04:52.112
The Friendship Journal
you wrote yourselves

04:52.200 --> 04:54.361
is a better guide than
any we could provide.

04:56.333 --> 04:58.596
We have the utmost
confidence in you.

04:58.684 --> 05:01.442
And we hope you have
the same in yourself.

05:05.775 --> 05:10.418
Oh, I'm absolutely
certain she does.

05:10.997 --> 05:14.168
I am not confident
about this at all!

05:14.317 --> 05:18.567
Well, that's what I thought.
I was being sarcastic before.

05:20.724 --> 05:23.784
What? This is all
so predictable.

05:23.872 --> 05:26.376
Now's the part where you all
tell little Sparkle here

05:26.463 --> 05:28.318
that everything is
going to be fine.

05:28.406 --> 05:33.449
But she won't believe you. I
don't need to be here for this.

05:35.027 --> 05:37.916
It's just, I know I said
yes, but then they said

05:38.004 --> 05:40.306
"in a few days" and there's
still so much to figure out.

05:40.394 --> 05:42.103
It's all happening so fast!

05:43.605 --> 05:45.191
I think I need some...

05:47.221 --> 05:49.126
OK. I'll feel
much better...

05:49.214 --> 05:51.971
Once you make
a plan?

05:52.156 --> 05:53.671
Oh. Wow. It's
like you...

05:53.759 --> 05:56.274
Knew you were going to
react this way? We did.

05:56.454 --> 05:58.369
Classic Twilighting.

05:58.456 --> 06:02.041
"Twilighting?" You...
you made me a verb?

06:02.227 --> 06:06.511
It's not a bad thing, we just
know you have a process.

06:06.598 --> 06:10.112
Stage one. You get big
news, and you're like "No!"

06:10.200 --> 06:13.088
But then you pace, and
you chart, you worry.

06:13.176 --> 06:15.385
It's OK. You go
ahead and "Twilight"

06:15.473 --> 06:17.565
and we'll be here for you.

06:17.660 --> 06:20.838
You're all acting so calm,
but this is a big deal!

06:20.926 --> 06:22.611
What will we do if
something big happens

06:22.699 --> 06:24.666
and the princesses
aren't there to help?

06:25.118 --> 06:26.994
Um... If you think about it,

06:27.082 --> 06:29.409
they literally
almost never help.

06:30.065 --> 06:31.159
Huh.

06:31.356 --> 06:33.448
And we still always win.

06:33.536 --> 06:35.643
Like when Sombra almost took
back the Crystal Empire,

06:35.731 --> 06:37.494
or when Chrysalis
pretended to be Cadance,

06:37.582 --> 06:39.631
or when Tirek came back and
absorbed all the magic,

06:39.719 --> 06:41.634
or the other time Chrysalis
tried to take over,

06:41.722 --> 06:45.231
or with Cozy Glow and the
school. Am I missing anything?

06:45.370 --> 06:46.417
Pony of Shadows.

06:46.504 --> 06:47.741
Starlight when
she was evil.

06:47.829 --> 06:49.016
Discord when he was evil.

06:49.104 --> 06:50.543
Do Flim and
Flam count?

06:50.754 --> 06:53.057
See? We've almost
always done things

06:53.144 --> 06:54.387
without the princesses' help.

06:54.475 --> 06:57.213
Which makes sense now because
it was all just training

06:57.301 --> 06:58.598
for you to take over.

06:58.686 --> 07:00.635
And it worked.
I mean, if you think about it,

07:00.723 --> 07:02.439
there hasn't been
a single villain

07:02.527 --> 07:03.699
that we couldn't defeat.

07:03.787 --> 07:04.957
Phew.

07:07.317 --> 07:09.232
One day, you'll see.

07:09.350 --> 07:12.363
I will defeat Twilight
Sparkle and her friends,

07:12.472 --> 07:15.293
and they will pay for
stealing my kingdom!

07:23.841 --> 07:25.020
Pssst! Tirek!

07:25.108 --> 07:29.676
It is Lord Tirek
and what is it now?

07:29.764 --> 07:31.621
I just want to make
sure you can see my

07:31.716 --> 07:34.293
"best friends rock
sculpture" from over there.

07:36.000 --> 07:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:03.777 --> 08:05.091
Lord Tirek.

08:05.201 --> 08:08.973
A changeling?
See? She gets it.

08:09.188 --> 08:11.487
Chrysalis, Queen
of the Changelings.

08:11.575 --> 08:15.355
Or at least I will be when I'm
restored to my rightful place.

08:16.145 --> 08:18.688
Why did you summon
me? What do you want?

08:18.776 --> 08:22.244
Oh, golly! We
didn't bring you.

08:22.332 --> 08:25.000
I thought you freed
us from Tartarus.

08:25.191 --> 08:27.650
Tartarus? Whoever
pulled you from there

08:27.738 --> 08:30.801
must have been somepony
very powerful, indeed.

08:40.269 --> 08:43.119
King Sombra!
You have returned?

08:43.207 --> 08:44.820
Why did you
bring us here?

08:44.907 --> 08:46.566
He didn't.

08:54.502 --> 08:56.543
It was I.

08:57.340 --> 09:01.473
You may call me... Grogar.

09:02.892 --> 09:04.208
The Grogar?

09:04.296 --> 09:06.253
I thought that you
were a legend.

09:06.341 --> 09:07.487
I've heard of you!

09:07.575 --> 09:08.817
Who?

09:09.065 --> 09:12.450
I assure you,
I am very real.

09:12.567 --> 09:15.932
And you have all been brought
here as part of my plan

09:16.020 --> 09:21.458
to rid Equestria of Twilight
Sparkle and her friends

09:21.567 --> 09:24.010
once and for all!

09:24.098 --> 09:26.302
Heh heh heh heh.

09:30.419 --> 09:33.802
I am so sorry, but
the name Grofar

09:33.942 --> 09:35.170
just doesn't
ring any bells.

09:35.257 --> 09:39.089
GROGAR! I have
been away too long

09:39.177 --> 09:41.714
if my name no longer
strikes fear into the heart

09:41.802 --> 09:44.028
of one so tiny.

09:44.690 --> 09:47.973
Perhaps a demonstration
of power is in order?

10:01.454 --> 10:05.671
Grogar is ancient and
extremely powerful.

10:05.759 --> 10:08.050
The land that would
become Equestria

10:08.138 --> 10:10.839
was a mere collection
of farms and pastures

10:10.926 --> 10:15.395
until he declared himself
Emperor of all he saw.

10:15.528 --> 10:19.630
I remember hearing tales of
his tyranny when I was young.

10:19.742 --> 10:23.058
I have also heard of the
first Emperor of Equestria,

10:23.192 --> 10:25.608
the "Father of Monsters."

10:25.875 --> 10:29.425
I gave life to the
foulest of creatures

10:29.512 --> 10:33.028
and allowed them to run wild,
taking what they wanted

10:33.115 --> 10:35.330
and destroying the rest!

10:35.417 --> 10:39.151
My reign was a glorious
fear-soaked epoch

10:39.239 --> 10:42.171
of darkness in Equestria.

10:42.411 --> 10:46.692
Ha! Until Gusty the Great
rose up and banished you.

10:46.780 --> 10:50.239
That fool believed taking
my bell would defeat me,

10:50.366 --> 10:53.716
but she only weakened
me temporarily.

10:53.903 --> 10:58.388
Um, Tirek is really old. No
offense, you look great.

10:58.476 --> 11:00.542
But if he knew about
you when he was young,

11:00.630 --> 11:03.372
we have super-different ideas
about what "temporarily" means.

11:03.578 --> 11:08.018
Silence! I have spent
millennia gathering power,

11:08.106 --> 11:11.526
biding my time, waiting
for the perfect opportunity

11:11.614 --> 11:15.653
to seize control of Equestria!
And watching all of you.

11:15.781 --> 11:18.557
I've seen each of your
humiliating defeats

11:18.645 --> 11:22.138
at the hooves of
six puny ponies.

11:22.834 --> 11:25.692
And do you know why
they've always bested you?

11:25.849 --> 11:27.697
Because they cheat.

11:27.785 --> 11:31.872
Because they are
annoyingly lucky.

11:32.559 --> 11:34.423
I'm just a kid, so...

11:34.510 --> 11:37.669
It is because they
work together.

11:37.913 --> 11:42.364
Where one is weak,
another is strong and thus unified,

11:42.451 --> 11:44.669
they are a formidable force.

11:44.905 --> 11:48.841
But we shall use their own
strategy to defeat them.

11:49.087 --> 11:50.927
What are you suggesting?

11:51.015 --> 11:55.604
I suggest nothing.
I demand that you join me

11:55.692 --> 11:59.684
and together Equestria
will be ours!

11:59.935 --> 12:04.083
I don't do "ours",
I only do MINE.

12:05.434 --> 12:08.809
I will take back the
Crystal Empire on my own

12:08.944 --> 12:12.864
and I will destroy anypony
who gets in my way!

12:13.113 --> 12:15.429
Such confidence.

12:15.618 --> 12:19.401
Go. Try to take
back your kingdom.

12:19.488 --> 12:21.638
I shall send you
there myself.

12:21.752 --> 12:24.020
If you prevail,
you may keep it.

12:24.207 --> 12:28.308
But when you fail,
you will submit to me.

12:28.661 --> 12:31.546
And if I refuse this... deal?

12:31.634 --> 12:33.768
Then I shall return
you to the darkness

12:33.856 --> 12:35.755
from which you
were summoned.

12:35.905 --> 12:38.237
Fine.
But this is a waste of time,

12:38.325 --> 12:40.889
as I will crush
those who defy me.

12:40.976 --> 12:43.917
I will defeat all who
get in my way. I...

12:45.085 --> 12:49.216
I advise the rest of you to
prepare to work together.

12:49.809 --> 12:52.839
Well, working together
sounds an awful lot like

12:52.927 --> 12:55.823
making friends,
so you two are in luck

12:55.911 --> 12:58.231
because I know all
about that.

13:01.363 --> 13:05.198
Twi? You in here? With the
school closed for the summer,

13:05.286 --> 13:07.583
I didn't think anypony
would be here.

13:07.794 --> 13:10.073
So much to do, not enough
time. No! I already did that.

13:10.161 --> 13:13.268
Wait. Nope. I didn't.
OOOH, NOT ENOUGH TIME!

13:13.356 --> 13:14.923
HELP! She's spiraling.

13:15.010 --> 13:17.284
We're at the "my plan
needs a plan" stage

13:17.372 --> 13:19.461
of a Total Twilight
Melt Down.

13:19.692 --> 13:21.731
Oh. Got it.

13:22.117 --> 13:23.465
Twilight?

13:23.552 --> 13:25.619
Did I write down "eliminate
redundant lists"

13:25.707 --> 13:27.301
on my School of
Friendship to-do list,

13:27.389 --> 13:29.159
or my personal to-do list?

13:29.342 --> 13:30.686
TWILIGHT! Gah!

13:30.781 --> 13:33.404
Starlight! Oh, good, you're
here. I need to talk to you.

13:33.538 --> 13:34.942
Oh-kay.

13:35.030 --> 13:37.200
Hang on, I had "talk to
Starlight" written down

13:37.288 --> 13:40.048
on one of these. Just let me
find it so I can cross it off.

13:40.280 --> 13:43.385
Wow, you are
Twilighting hard.

13:43.472 --> 13:44.983
You say
Twilighting too?

13:45.071 --> 13:47.692
Well, excuse me, but
this is the first time

13:47.780 --> 13:50.163
I've ever been asked
to run A WHOLE KINGDOM!

13:50.299 --> 13:52.514
You're right. You're right.

13:52.715 --> 13:54.997
So what did you want
to talk to me about?

13:55.084 --> 13:57.045
Ah here it is.
I wrote it down.

13:57.185 --> 13:59.138
Starlight, you have blossomed
into one of the strongest,

13:59.225 --> 14:00.498
smartest, most
caring ponies I know

14:00.585 --> 14:02.445
and I can't think of anypony
better to leave in charge

14:02.532 --> 14:03.804
of my castle and the
School of Friendship.

14:03.891 --> 14:04.905
So what do you think?

14:05.045 --> 14:07.762
WHAT? You want me to
take care of the castle

14:07.850 --> 14:09.559
and RUN THE SCHOOL?

14:09.647 --> 14:10.670
Yes.

14:10.758 --> 14:13.114
I can't!
I'm not ready!

14:13.202 --> 14:14.676
Remember what happened
the last time

14:14.764 --> 14:16.084
you left me in charge?

14:16.171 --> 14:18.520
And now you want me
to do it PERMANENTLY?

14:18.607 --> 14:21.457
What if I don't do the
right things? What if...

14:21.545 --> 14:23.528
Starlight!
Get a hold of yourself.

14:23.616 --> 14:26.028
You've risen to every
challenge you've ever faced.

14:26.115 --> 14:29.983
You can do anything you put
your mind to. You've got this.

14:30.185 --> 14:34.569
Ha! And so do you!
See what I did there?

14:34.656 --> 14:37.306
You just said everything
you need to hear.

14:37.467 --> 14:41.200
Ha ha ha! Nice try, but running
a school and running a country

14:41.288 --> 14:42.411
are two very different things!

14:42.498 --> 14:44.715
Now if you don't
mind, I have 7,432

14:44.803 --> 14:46.304
more things to take
care of before I become

14:46.391 --> 14:47.795
the new Ruler of Equestria!

14:50.154 --> 14:52.085
It was a valiant effort.

15:27.001 --> 15:29.423
The guard says Sombra's
breached the castle!

15:29.511 --> 15:32.156
Hurry, Twilight!
We need you!

15:33.560 --> 15:35.409
Do you have
Flurry Heart?

15:35.551 --> 15:36.796
I thought
you had her!

15:36.921 --> 15:38.203
Agh!

15:40.522 --> 15:42.320
Mama!

15:43.637 --> 15:45.686
You won't get
away with this.

15:45.828 --> 15:48.492
Oh,
but I already have!

15:50.820 --> 15:53.882
Ha ha ha ha.

15:54.334 --> 15:57.316
With the Cyrstal heart
now in my possession,

15:57.428 --> 16:00.017
there is nothing to
stop me from ruling

16:00.105 --> 16:02.574
the Crystal Empire.

16:03.910 --> 16:06.894
Kneel before Sombra!

16:08.302 --> 16:12.863
Ah. Long live the King.

16:19.514 --> 16:20.674
Thanks for coming so quickly.

16:21.607 --> 16:23.778
Sure thing, but if you're
going to be the ruler

16:23.866 --> 16:26.415
of Equestria, you may want
to work on your penmanship.

16:26.502 --> 16:27.924
This looks like it says,

16:28.012 --> 16:30.352
"Cadance sent an
emergency message.

16:30.527 --> 16:34.230
Sombra's back and he's taking
over the Crystal Empire."

16:34.362 --> 16:36.157
That's exactly what it says!

16:36.245 --> 16:37.826
But. But how is that
possible?

16:37.996 --> 16:39.980
I thought the Crystal
Heart had dispelled him

16:40.082 --> 16:41.129
into the Ether!

16:41.216 --> 16:44.056
I have no idea,
but he's back and it's up to us

16:44.144 --> 16:46.134
to save the Empire
and my family!

16:46.221 --> 16:48.512
Shouldn't somepony
tell Celestia and Luna?

16:48.637 --> 16:50.353
Oooh. Good point.

16:50.441 --> 16:53.408
One of us should probably
loop in the real rulers

16:53.495 --> 16:54.879
of Equestria.

16:55.230 --> 16:57.931
No. If we're going
to run Equestria,

16:58.019 --> 17:00.415
we'll need to handle things
like this on our own.

17:00.582 --> 17:04.419
Oh, Twilight! Could
this mean that you finally

17:04.506 --> 17:07.122
have the confidence to
ascend to the throne

17:07.209 --> 17:10.246
like the princesses
believe you can?

17:10.479 --> 17:15.152
Maybe. Unless you'd consider
taking care of Sombra for us?

17:16.383 --> 17:18.970
Oh, no no no no no. You
were absolutely right.

17:19.058 --> 17:21.722
You need to learn how to handle
these things on your own.

17:21.863 --> 17:23.505
Ta-tah.

17:23.768 --> 17:26.019
Handling things on our
own is all well and good,

17:26.107 --> 17:29.347
but last time we defeated
Sombra with the Crystal Heart.

17:29.438 --> 17:32.613
What if he has it already?
How are we gonna stop him?

17:40.209 --> 17:41.857
With the Elements of Harmony!

17:41.944 --> 17:45.207
With those, we can defeat
anypony, even Sombra!

17:45.361 --> 17:47.294
Ah no no no no.
You didn't need

17:47.382 --> 17:49.535
the "Elements" the last
time you defeated Sombra.

17:49.623 --> 17:52.267
And I'm not sure using
them still counts

17:52.355 --> 17:54.418
as handling things
on your own.

17:54.656 --> 17:58.807
My family is in danger.
I'm not taking any chances.

17:59.004 --> 18:00.575
She's got a point.

18:00.662 --> 18:02.429
Ugh. Fine.

18:03.554 --> 18:05.135
What's his problem?

18:05.223 --> 18:07.991
Starlight, can you stay here
and take care of the school?

18:08.079 --> 18:09.582
I've got you covered.

18:30.626 --> 18:33.582
It's cute that you think
that will do anything.

18:33.829 --> 18:37.207
It might not, but they will.

18:37.317 --> 18:38.808
Cavalry's here!

18:41.246 --> 18:43.885
How can I be surprised
when I'm waiting to show

18:44.066 --> 18:46.821
all of you your greatest fear?

19:04.464 --> 19:07.668
Oh, Twilight. How
disappointing.

19:07.795 --> 19:11.545
Equestria was in your care
and you let it be destroyed.

19:13.802 --> 19:15.717
You should all surrender.

19:15.804 --> 19:19.287
Nothing can defeat
your own fears.

19:24.446 --> 19:26.066
We didn't need to defeat them.

19:26.154 --> 19:28.947
We just needed to face them
long enough to distract you!

19:33.568 --> 19:36.590
NO!

19:36.691 --> 19:39.558
It's cute that you think
that will do anything.

19:50.672 --> 19:55.582
You may have won the battle,
but I shall win the war!

20:03.985 --> 20:05.801
Ya hoo hoo hoo!

20:07.913 --> 20:11.410
We totally just wiped
the castle with that guy.

20:16.411 --> 20:17.777
Thanks, Twily.

20:19.207 --> 20:20.515
That was fun!

20:20.602 --> 20:21.894
And easy.

20:22.010 --> 20:24.659
As magical battles go,
that was a cakewalk.

20:24.840 --> 20:27.590
Mhmmm, "cakewalk".

20:30.573 --> 20:33.535
We did handle this
pretty well on our own.

20:33.623 --> 20:34.933
Does this mean...?

20:35.090 --> 20:37.637
I still don't feel like I'm
one hundred percent ready,

20:37.853 --> 20:39.111
but will I ever?

20:39.199 --> 20:41.441
Knowing you? Nope.

20:41.894 --> 20:45.874
I have you guys, and we have
the Elements, and together,

20:45.972 --> 20:48.324
we've never failed.
We'll be OK.

20:57.005 --> 20:59.918
Once again, Equestria is safe.

21:00.221 --> 21:02.191
What should we
do to celebrate?

21:02.301 --> 21:04.371
I vote for a cakewalk!

21:14.790 --> 21:16.113
What's going on?

21:16.246 --> 21:17.605
I don't know.
