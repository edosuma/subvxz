00:04.650 --> 00:07.699
I promise to love, honour,
and write you daily.

00:07.740 --> 00:10.732
You should take care of
my car while I'm gone.

00:10.790 --> 00:14.430
You won't be coming back to the
same girl you left behind.

00:14.490 --> 00:16.310
I haven't done right by you.

00:16.360 --> 00:19.614
This may be the last chance
we have to _talk before the
war IS done.

00:19.670 --> 00:20.739
We used to date.

00:20.800 --> 00:22.097
Him or her?

00:22.150 --> 00:23.708
Him, of course.

00:23.760 --> 00:27.662
The way I see it. Life
is short, why not make
it a happy one?

00:27.720 --> 00:30.496
When am I going to
get my life back?

00:30.550 --> 00:33.451
When the war is over.I can't wait that long.

00:33.510 --> 00:38.288
Your fiance, Lt. James Dunn,
was killed during a
bombing raid.

01:04.620 --> 01:06.497
Mrs. Dunn.

01:06.540 --> 01:10.408
You're a good girl to make
the trek to Massachusetts.

01:10.460 --> 01:11.973
I was his fiance.

01:12.020 --> 01:13.499
Mm.

01:13.550 --> 01:16.417
This is Floyd Barker.
He served with my son.

01:16.460 --> 01:17.449
My condolences.

01:17.510 --> 01:19.637
James spoke so
highly of you.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.728
Yes, he loved her.

01:21.770 --> 01:24.466
He enlisted to impress her.

01:24.510 --> 01:28.162
And to think we could have
kept him out of this war.

01:28.210 --> 01:31.088
I know how awful it
is to lose a child,

01:31.130 --> 01:33.951
but I fail to see how
our daughter's to blame.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.865
We're all very sorry
for your loss.

01:35.920 --> 01:37.171
Yes.

01:37.220 --> 01:38.619
Ma'am.

01:42.840 --> 01:44.614
Thank you, son.

01:51.020 --> 01:53.534
This is truly unbearable.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.843
With every death,

01:58.900 --> 02:03.280
your brother's passing
comes crashing down on her.

02:03.340 --> 02:05.023
Mrs. Dunn was right.

02:05.080 --> 02:07.548
You're hardly caused of
your fianc's demise.

02:07.600 --> 02:10.160
If I wasn't so adamant
that he serve.

02:10.210 --> 02:11.598
You cannot blame yourself.

02:11.650 --> 02:14.380
But I do, Daddy.

02:14.430 --> 02:16.159
I do.

02:22.010 --> 02:23.261
I don't believe it.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.437
I lobbied for months,
wrote how many letters

02:25.490 --> 02:27.003
and they go and deny me!

02:27.050 --> 02:28.483
Telephone?

02:28.530 --> 02:30.486
Yes the telephone! "Wartime
restrictions," my foot.

02:30.540 --> 02:32.531
A nonsense luxury
if you ask me.

02:32.580 --> 02:34.889
Tell that to half the
city who has one.

02:34.930 --> 02:37.535
I had a place for
it set right there.

02:37.590 --> 02:39.490
It'll sit empty till
the war's over.

02:39.550 --> 02:41.415
Which might be sooner
than we thought.

02:41.460 --> 02:44.987
Our boys landed in France.

02:45.030 --> 02:47.203
So it's true?

02:47.250 --> 02:48.899
Third report.

02:48.950 --> 02:52.590
Small coastal village...
Dieppe.

02:52.650 --> 02:55.733
Sounds like destroyers lit up
the way for landing craft,

02:55.780 --> 02:58.738
and infantrymen stormed
the beaches.

02:58.780 --> 03:00.953
Do you think Stanley...

03:01.000 --> 03:04.731
Gene too. They would
have had air-support.

03:04.790 --> 03:06.917
It started.

03:06.960 --> 03:09.224
Our boys are taking
back Europe.

03:19.110 --> 03:26.539
Oh, Kate. Just pluck 'em
from the stem... gentle.

03:26.590 --> 03:29.548
What are we going to do with
all these tomatoes?

03:29.600 --> 03:32.558
Eat what we can, and
can what we can't.

03:32.600 --> 03:38.596
The more we grow here for
ourselves, the more is left to
ship to our boys who need it.

03:38.650 --> 03:42.427
Pearl! You hungry for some of
these flippin' summer squash?

03:42.480 --> 03:45.608
They told us to plant every
inch of the city,

03:45.660 --> 03:48.128
they forgot it all comes
up at the same time.

03:48.180 --> 03:49.215
That's quite the contraption.

03:49.270 --> 03:52.489
Tube-radio, brand new!

03:52.530 --> 03:56.739
[Radio News]

03:56.800 --> 03:58.927
Our boys landed in
France like champs

03:58.970 --> 04:00.574
and_o_ur bombs are
raining hell-fire.

04:00.630 --> 04:02.848
Wait, so that's the
hourly news?

04:02.890 --> 04:04.278
Every hour.

04:04.330 --> 04:06.195
Shoot. I gotta skedaddle.

04:06.240 --> 04:07.366
Where?

04:07.420 --> 04:09.638
Ivan's buying me
pancakes at the Tulip.

04:09.680 --> 04:11.636
Looking like that?

04:11.680 --> 04:14.945
Yeah, he said something
about wanting me looking
like a farmer's daughter?

04:14.990 --> 04:18.118
Thought you said we'd
finish what we started here?

04:18.170 --> 04:22.516
I'll pull my share... Later.
Bye Pearl.

04:30.180 --> 04:32.398
Army men, working here?

04:32.440 --> 04:36.262
You'd think all the boys'd be
clamoring to ship out after
Dieppe was such a success.

04:36.310 --> 04:38.528
You can tell that
from the papers?

04:38.580 --> 04:41.538
Half the women here got
someone overseas.

04:41.580 --> 04:44.538
Mrs.Corbett must be beside
herself with worry.

04:44.580 --> 04:47.048
Carol. What a suprise.

04:47.110 --> 04:48.623
Come down to pitch in?

04:48.670 --> 04:50.319
I'm here about Gladys.

04:50.370 --> 04:51.189
How is she?

04:51.240 --> 04:53.196
She needs her friends.

04:53.240 --> 04:57.336
Not that I'm not her best
friend and she has plenty from
tennis club and such.

04:57.380 --> 04:58.460
But still.

04:58.510 --> 05:00.421
You're having trouble
getting through.

05:00.470 --> 05:02.552
Yes. And I'm out of ideas.

05:02.600 --> 05:04.682
I've sent four cards now.

05:04.730 --> 05:08.166
Me, I tromped up there twice,
maid said she was "sleeping".

05:08.220 --> 05:11.599
She's stuck in that
house with her mother
with no plans to leave.

05:11.650 --> 05:16.656
She needs help,
she needs you.

05:16.700 --> 05:19.487
You're such a good team.

05:28.320 --> 05:30.663
All those boys gunning
for action...

05:30.720 --> 05:32.142
they must be loving this!

05:32.200 --> 05:33.679
They can keep their
French beach.

05:33.720 --> 05:36.632
I'd rather be on a rooftop
with a pretty girl.

05:36.680 --> 05:41.800
How you like the olives?
Che buono!

05:41.860 --> 05:43.816
They must be
hard to come by.

05:43.860 --> 05:45.851
I've a friend in the
old import-export.

05:45.910 --> 05:51.030
I see. Well tell your mother
her burrata is great.

05:51.080 --> 05:53.731
You've become
qUIte the gourmet.

05:53.780 --> 05:57.216
Boss-men would have a bird if
they knew we were up here.

05:57.260 --> 05:59.046
I'm done with them.

05:59.090 --> 06:01.968
Their rules and their
boiled canteen chow.

06:02.010 --> 06:04.649
You hear they lace the
stuff with saltpetre?

06:04.710 --> 06:06.666
Haven't heard that
in the office.

06:06.710 --> 06:11.090
They do say it's not natural
for men and women to work
together lIke we do.

06:11.150 --> 06:13.106
It's true.

06:13.150 --> 06:15.584
They used to put saltpetre
in bullets.

06:15.630 --> 06:18.895
Now they use it to take the
power out of our pistols.

06:18.940 --> 06:22.194
Oh I'm sure you don't have any
difficulty in that department.

06:22.250 --> 06:25.026
Nope it's 'cause I stick
with the provolone.

06:29.560 --> 06:34.509
Seems they've got Ma
Bell putting new lines
in here every week.

06:34.560 --> 06:37.381
This war is a growing business.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.908
They brung me in
from St. Kitts.

06:39.960 --> 06:43.179
Oh, you're from out of town?

06:43.220 --> 06:46.303
Yeah, got us shacked
up in Cabbagetown.

06:46.360 --> 06:49.318
Cabbagetown's around
the corner from me!

06:49.360 --> 06:50.918
Well what do you know.

06:50.970 --> 06:53.188
Five or six corners, but...

06:53.230 --> 06:55.790
If you ever want
a home-cooked meal?

06:55.850 --> 06:57.056
Look Mrs...
Lorna.

06:57.110 --> 06:59.624
I got a pretty good idea
what you're up to.

06:59.680 --> 07:04.708
I'm a desperate woman,
Mr... Ernest.

07:04.770 --> 07:08.854
We don't install private
lines that aren't essential
to the war-effort, sorry.

07:08.900 --> 07:12.119
Oh but it is. Just now I'm
up here making roster

07:12.170 --> 07:13.853
after three girls
called in sick.

07:13.910 --> 07:17.255
Now if I'd a home phone,
I'd've found subs first thing.

07:17.300 --> 07:20.258
You read the news hardly a
time for lost womanpower.

07:20.300 --> 07:21.699
If that isn't _essential
war-busmess,

07:21.740 --> 07:25.824
I don't know what is.

07:28.790 --> 07:36.879
I'm putting a pair ofjuicy
chops on the pan tonight.

07:36.930 --> 07:42.493
Now I know how bad those
road-houses can be.

07:42.540 --> 07:46.636
Let me cook for you.

07:46.680 --> 07:49.763
I can't stop thinking about our
boys marching on French soil!

07:49.810 --> 07:52.768
I been saying for weeks they
should send 'em in.

07:52.820 --> 07:56.369
I need you to set up a
half-dozen more intake
files for tomorrow.

07:56.430 --> 08:00.207
National Defence is sending
us some soldiers to cover
the labour shortage.

08:00.260 --> 08:03.036
I only hope the girls
can keep their heads on.

08:03.090 --> 08:04.864
Sir, I checked these
ledger-entries seven ways

08:04.910 --> 08:06.992
till Sunday but keep
getting the same result.

08:07.050 --> 08:08.301
This doesn't make sense.

08:08.350 --> 08:10.170
Exactly. For the
last two months,

08:10.220 --> 08:12.916
Blue Shift's order-overages
have been double the
allowable margin.

08:12.970 --> 08:14.528
It's just small amounts.

08:14.580 --> 08:16.832
Until you add it up.

08:16.880 --> 08:20.577
No other shift goes
over like we do.

08:20.630 --> 08:25.658
Back to your job,
Miss Burr. Your own job.

08:25.720 --> 08:28.712
It's gotta be illegal,
spiking the food with saltpetre.

08:28.760 --> 08:30.580
So stop eating at
the canteen.

08:30.640 --> 08:33.859
I would, but that
beef stew's so good.

08:33.900 --> 08:36.243
I can't be the only
one feeling "low."

08:36.290 --> 08:38.110
Hate to interrupt the
day's clam-bake

08:38.160 --> 08:39.855
but we've got
missing explosives.

08:39.910 --> 08:41.810
Yeah you're telling me.

08:41.860 --> 08:45.421
TNT inventory is all screwy
and I got a secretary
catching your mess!

08:45.480 --> 08:46.868
Oh yeah which secretary?

08:46.910 --> 08:48.639
That's none of your concern.

08:48.700 --> 08:52.397
What is, is the location of a
fair whack of deadly chemicals.

08:52.440 --> 08:54.488
What are you saying,
we stole them?

08:54.530 --> 08:56.703
Who the heck'd want them?

08:56.750 --> 08:58.308
You tell me.

08:58.360 --> 09:00.874
Leon, you're quiet.

09:00.930 --> 09:02.704
Not much to say,
Mr. Aikins.

09:02.750 --> 09:05.446
Y'ask me, it's another
management SNAFU..

09:05.500 --> 09:07.104
You're materials controller,
Moretti.

09:07.150 --> 09:10.199
Do your damn job.
Get me some answers.

09:10.240 --> 09:13.767
Boys seeing action now, we
can't be losing inventory.

09:13.810 --> 09:15.630
A secretary's got us
tap-dancing here?

09:15.680 --> 09:18.672
Typical Aikins. Covers
his ass by blaming the
few honest men he's got.

09:18.730 --> 09:20.721
So we find what
he's looking for.

09:20.770 --> 09:23.648
This stuff can't have grown
legs and walked off.

09:23.690 --> 09:26.944
You can go looking for it.
I'm doing my job not his.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.206
I'm with Leon.

09:28.260 --> 09:30.387
Lets find what's missing
and clear our names.

09:33.660 --> 09:36.788
Do you think this is a
good hostess gift?

09:36.830 --> 09:42.268
They got a cook, she'll
bake a loaf or something.

09:42.320 --> 09:45.699
It's just, they do own a
chain of food stores.

09:45.750 --> 09:51.791
Well, I don't hear you coming
up with a better idea.

09:51.850 --> 09:52.748
Hi, Betty.

09:52.800 --> 09:57.191
Teresa. You're back?

09:57.240 --> 09:58.673
You remember...

09:58.720 --> 10:01.154
Yes. Hi. Where've you been?

10:01.200 --> 10:03.851
Stomping across our time-zone
selling bonds for six weeks.

10:03.900 --> 10:05.765
Back now for a new post.

10:05.820 --> 10:08.596
We're just headed out,
to cheer up a friend.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.641
Oh sure. I'll see
you later then.

10:10.690 --> 10:16.731
No. Uh, Kate, you go.
I'll catch up.

10:16.790 --> 10:18.997
Betty, we promised.

10:19.050 --> 10:21.041
It's like you with the
gardening, Kate.

10:21.090 --> 10:23.877
I'll pull my share later.

10:23.920 --> 10:25.137
Welcome back.

10:25.180 --> 10:26.704
Thank you.

10:28.970 --> 10:30.449
Hi.

10:30.490 --> 10:31.798
Hi.

10:34.370 --> 10:37.589
Must be how Princess Elizabeth
lives.

10:37.630 --> 10:39.757
Vera. Where's Betty?

10:39.810 --> 10:41.766
She'll be by later.

10:41.810 --> 10:43.675
We had a clearly
laid-out plan.

10:43.730 --> 10:46.597
Is this a tea-party or
a military manoeuvre?

10:46.640 --> 10:50.076
No talk of "military" and no
mention of James, understand?

10:50.120 --> 10:52.816
We're here to get her
mind off that man.

10:52.860 --> 10:53.770
Gladys!

10:53.820 --> 10:56.038
Isn't this a lovely surprise.

10:56.090 --> 10:58.342
More like a surprise attack.

10:58.390 --> 11:00.346
Now I know how the
Germans felt.

11:00.390 --> 11:01.561
We brought you these.

11:01.610 --> 11:03.692
We grew them in our
Victory garden.

11:03.750 --> 11:08.221
How industrious.
What splendid gourds.

11:08.270 --> 11:10.443
Thank you.

11:14.360 --> 11:16.749
I'm sorry I haven't
been in touch.

11:16.800 --> 11:20.713
We're together now.

11:20.760 --> 11:23.069
Looks like Vera brought
some fan magazines!

11:23.110 --> 11:26.113
It's important to keep
up on world affairs.

11:26.160 --> 11:29.118
What are they saying about
Dieppe down at the plant?

11:29.160 --> 11:30.639
Lemon, Gladys?

11:30.690 --> 11:33.158
I wonderif James'
unIt was Involved.

11:33.210 --> 11:35.724
Just so little real news.

11:35.780 --> 11:37.122
I read in the Telegram,

11:37.170 --> 11:39.343
Mountbatten's having a
tough time trying to explain

11:39.390 --> 11:41.472
how his retreat_ could
be seem as a Victory.

11:41.520 --> 11:43.476
Vera !

11:43.520 --> 11:45.659
Mrs. Witham, would
you like some tea?

11:45.700 --> 11:46.951
I came armed, dearie.

11:48.880 --> 11:51.610
Have you heard the news
about the Operatic Society?

11:51.660 --> 11:54.049
They're doing Pirates
of Penzance.

11:54.100 --> 11:57.149
And guess who'll be gracing
the Eaton Stage as Frederic.

11:57.190 --> 11:58.009
Moi!

11:58.060 --> 12:00.972
Wouldn't Frederic be... a boy?

12:01.020 --> 12:04.365
Well, with no men to
flesh out parts...

12:04.410 --> 12:06.628
James loved the
Round Room there.

12:06.680 --> 12:08.762
He always ordered
the same thing.

12:11.810 --> 12:13.892
Beef Wellington and
creamed carrots.

12:13.950 --> 12:16.635
We need you back on
the line, Gladys.

12:16.690 --> 12:20.467
Mr. Aikins is beside himself
with the labour shortage.

12:20.520 --> 12:22.943
Please, Talk to Mrs. Corbett.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.774
James never liked
me workIng there.

12:24.830 --> 12:29.563
Gladys, stop dwelling,
for Pete's sake.

12:29.610 --> 12:31.612
Have a little cheer
for your guests.

12:31.660 --> 12:34.390
I think you've had enough
cheer for all of us, Mother.

12:34.440 --> 12:36.260
Has anyone been to
Allan Gardens?

12:36.320 --> 12:39.221
Their orchid display
is sublime right now!

12:39.280 --> 12:42.829
You took that boy for granted,
now you're punishing yourself.

12:42.890 --> 12:44.141
Mother.

12:44.190 --> 12:48.581
You thought he'd come
back, you'd be forgiven.

12:48.630 --> 12:53.021
Only that would happen now.

12:53.070 --> 12:55.026
And if you don't
forgive yourself...

12:55.070 --> 12:59.814
you know who you'll become.

13:01.780 --> 13:04.032
My brother died a
few years back,

13:04.080 --> 13:06.389
but he still casts a
long shadow.

13:06.430 --> 13:10.639
We love you, Gladys.
You know that.

13:10.700 --> 13:14.568
Thank you for coming.
Enjoy your tea.

13:16.660 --> 13:21.188
She's got to get
out of here.

13:25.020 --> 13:26.408
Thank you.

13:33.020 --> 13:34.100
Miss Witham...

13:34.160 --> 13:37.027
Floyd Barker.

13:37.070 --> 13:39.197
What are you doing here?

13:39.250 --> 13:41.115
The Dunns assured me
you'd understand.

13:41.160 --> 13:42.331
Understand what?

13:42.380 --> 13:45.508
Their son's car.

13:45.560 --> 13:47.869
I'm here to fetch it.

13:51.260 --> 13:54.696
He gave it to me...
for safekeeping.

13:54.740 --> 13:56.696
We had trips together.

13:56.740 --> 14:02.485
Niagara Falls, Lake Muskoka.

14:02.530 --> 14:03.701
If this is about money?

14:03.750 --> 14:06.059
They want the car, Ma'am.

14:06.100 --> 14:11.845
By rights, they can have it.

14:11.890 --> 14:15.064
Mr. Barker...

14:15.110 --> 14:19.843
it's all I have of him.

14:19.900 --> 14:23.939
I'm staying at the
Windsor Arms a few days.

14:23.990 --> 14:25.412
Take your time.

14:25.470 --> 14:28.724
Save yourself a hotel bill,
you're not getting the car.

14:28.780 --> 14:29.724
Ma'am, I have to...

14:29.780 --> 14:30.553
Get out!

14:30.600 --> 14:31.817
Now! Get out!

14:41.310 --> 14:43.619
It's just a hunk of metal.

14:46.490 --> 14:49.129
They're taking everything.

14:49.190 --> 14:52.751
Nothing that matters.

14:52.800 --> 14:55.792
Get your coat, Gladys,
you're coming with us.

14:55.850 --> 14:57.238
I don't think so.

14:57.280 --> 15:02.638
You're walking out,
or we're moving in.

15:06.730 --> 15:10.029
Olive oil! Frankie!
How many years?
[In Italian]

15:10.080 --> 15:13.425
One moment. I've
something for you.

15:13.470 --> 15:15.461
Olive oil, Marco. Olive oil!
[In Italian]

15:15.520 --> 15:17.863
You got a grove
in the backyard?

15:17.910 --> 15:18.774
I know a guy.

15:18.830 --> 15:20.991
You seem to know
a lot of guys.

15:21.050 --> 15:22.915
Marco Moretti,
always the altar boy.

15:22.960 --> 15:24.825
And you still drinking
communion wine.

15:24.880 --> 15:26.871
You're the one
wanted to see me.

15:26.920 --> 15:28.706
I wanna know _who
you found at Vchu.

15:28.750 --> 15:30.741
"Found"? What are
you talking about?

15:30.790 --> 15:32.792
C'mon, Frankie.

15:32.840 --> 15:34.569
I know you're a fence.

15:34.620 --> 15:39.717
I gotta ask if your fun
and games include selling
black-market TNT.

15:39.760 --> 15:42.320
Funny how you think so much
of the mangiacakes...

15:42.370 --> 15:43.621
so little of us.

15:43.680 --> 15:45.898
You're the devil I know.

15:45.940 --> 15:47.988
You got the wrong guy, paesano.

15:48.030 --> 15:54.333
Frankie, for your mother.

15:54.380 --> 15:58.464
She'll be delighted.
[In Italian]

15:58.520 --> 16:01.648
I hear anything on the street,
I'll let you know.

16:05.050 --> 16:08.827
Such a good boy.

Fellow's giving me the eye like
I don't belong in my own home.

16:22.930 --> 16:25.842
Perhaps he didn't...
expect you here.

16:25.890 --> 16:30.247
Ahhh, so a flirt got him
through the door.

16:30.290 --> 16:34.112
So you're getting us
all linked in to the
big, bad world.

16:34.160 --> 16:37.550
Doing my best...

16:37.600 --> 16:38.908
You fought?

16:38.950 --> 16:41.032
Fourth Brigade,
Nineteenth Battalion.

16:41.080 --> 16:42.638
The Somme?

16:42.690 --> 16:45.739
Yeah. You?

16:45.780 --> 16:49.784
Vimy. First Canadian,
out of Hamilton.

16:49.830 --> 16:53.129
What do you make of
this week's raid?

16:53.180 --> 16:55.136
Well they're not telling
us everything.

16:55.180 --> 16:57.785
We got two boys over there.
One's in infantry,

16:57.840 --> 16:59.535
so it's anyone's guess.

16:59.580 --> 17:01.013
Bob! Enough of that.

17:01.060 --> 17:04.018
Honestly, it's like living
with the Voice of Doom.

17:04.060 --> 17:06.790
Well.

17:06.850 --> 17:09.193
Okay, you got a dial-tone.

17:09.240 --> 17:13.768
You just lift the
receiver, make sure no-one
else is on the line.

17:13.810 --> 17:16.893
Nowadays you dial
without an operator,

17:16.940 --> 17:18.635
just start with the exchange,

17:18.680 --> 17:20.591
so you don't have to
memorize all six numbers.

That's not your ring.

17:25.470 --> 17:28.030
Like I said, it's
a party line,

17:28.090 --> 17:29.819
it's you and four neighbours.

17:29.870 --> 17:30.859
What are we?

17:30.910 --> 17:33.731
A long and two short.

17:36.830 --> 17:38.786
A long and two short.

17:38.840 --> 17:41.092
We were all the way
up to Thunder Bay

17:41.140 --> 17:44.405
and you know what
they were growing?

17:44.450 --> 17:46.884
Like a miracle.

17:46.930 --> 17:51.799
You sure you're
comfortable there?

17:51.850 --> 17:55.547
I got neighbours.
And thin walls.

18:05.690 --> 18:08.466
The littlest ones are the
sweetest, don't you think?

18:08.520 --> 18:11.865
I think it's 'cause we know
they won't be around for long.

18:11.910 --> 18:14.344
Look, I'm here until
my next orders come.

18:14.390 --> 18:17.564
I don't know what
they'll be or when.

18:17.610 --> 18:20.522

ship out right now.

kind of miracle, I guess.

Palais Royale...

18:51.520 --> 18:53.647
Everywhere I turn,
I think of him.

18:53.690 --> 18:55.738
That's why you need
distractions like this.

18:55.780 --> 18:58.863
Trust me, Gladys it's how
we start feeling better.

18:58.920 --> 19:02.913
Katie, why don't we go
dance off some of this beer?

19:02.960 --> 19:04.825
Maybe your mother's
not wrong.

19:04.880 --> 19:09.704
Maybe you do need to
forgive yourself.

19:09.750 --> 19:12.355
The last time I spoke to James,

19:12.410 --> 19:14.799
I was ready to end it.

19:14.840 --> 19:16.660
That's not why he died, Gladys.

19:16.720 --> 19:19.974
I could hear these
bombs falling.

19:20.020 --> 19:22.716
IfI hadn't made
that phone call,

19:22.770 --> 19:25.853
he would never have been
in the line of fire.

19:25.900 --> 19:27.765
Do not beat yourself up.

19:27.810 --> 19:29.459

19:29.510 --> 19:33.685
It's not supposed to happen
during a war, but it does.

19:36.910 --> 19:40.289
Gladys just needs a
friendly nudge, to help her
forget her problems.

19:40.350 --> 19:43.080
You're just saying that because
that's how you play it.

19:43.130 --> 19:46.952
You lost both your parents and
I've heard you mention them
excatly once.

19:47.010 --> 19:48.352
There's not much to say.

19:48.400 --> 19:50.573
What do you mean?
They're your family!

19:50.620 --> 19:52.963
And I don't know a
thing about them.

19:53.010 --> 19:54.875
I told you TB took my mom.

19:54.930 --> 19:57.182
And my dad, he...
had a bad fall.

19:57.230 --> 19:59.846
That leaves my two younger
brothers up in North Bay.

You have brothers?

20:01.150 --> 20:03.710

You must miss them

We should have them
down one weekend.

20:09.200 --> 20:13.113
Take them down to Riverdale

No. It's better this way.

Jubilee was a success.

21:11.220 --> 21:14.212
Some of these men, though
they're only missing.

21:14.270 --> 21:16.044

Welcome, ladies. I'm Lorna
Corbett, your floor matron.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.479
Are you the leader, Miss...

24:00.520 --> 24:01.600
Sergeant. Sergeant Hill.

24:01.650 --> 24:04.175
Of course. Old habits.

24:04.220 --> 24:05.528
Miss McRae?

24:05.570 --> 24:07.822
The Women's Army Corps has sent
a group of, uh...

24:07.880 --> 24:10.485
Soldiers. We're soldiers, Ma'am.

24:10.530 --> 24:12.964
Yes. To assist with
Quality Control.

24:13.010 --> 24:14.227
When did all this happen.

24:14.270 --> 24:15.794
Orders came in
this morning.

24:15.840 --> 24:17.967
There was a call
for SIX of us.

24:18.020 --> 24:19.009
And you volunteered.

24:19.060 --> 24:20.049
You'll find we're
fast learners.

24:20.110 --> 24:21.668
Glad to hear it, Sergeant.

24:21.720 --> 24:23.142
They'll need coveralls.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.236
And gruesome twosomes.
I'll show them where to change.

24:25.280 --> 24:26.929
You're in good hands,
Sergeant Hill.

24:26.980 --> 24:28.060
Thank you.

24:33.990 --> 24:35.639
Administration.

24:35.690 --> 24:39.467
There's stolen TNT going out
on a truck today at 2pm.

24:39.520 --> 24:40.817
Check the toolbox.

24:40.870 --> 24:42.030
Who is this?

24:50.050 --> 24:51.654
Mr. Aikins?

24:55.920 --> 24:59.879
You'd better have a good reason
to be down here, Miss Demers.

24:59.930 --> 25:01.921
I believe I do, Ma'am.
The telephone.

25:01.970 --> 25:03.107
Yes?

25:03.150 --> 25:07.621
There's a call for you.
It's your husband.

25:11.810 --> 25:15.246
Hey Lore, it's me.

25:15.290 --> 25:17.758
I hate bothering you
at work like this.

25:17.820 --> 25:19.947
Why aren't you out at the stand?

25:19.990 --> 25:22.038
Because there's news here, Lore.

25:22.080 --> 25:23.866
Oh God...

25:23.910 --> 25:28.904
Stanley... is listed as
missing in action.

25:28.960 --> 25:30.860
Now that could mean anything.

25:30.920 --> 25:33.172
Dieppe's a long ways away,
and...

25:33.220 --> 25:35.393
it seems it was a big mission.

25:35.440 --> 25:37.829
Lots of men got lost in
the shuffle.

25:37.880 --> 25:40.053
Damn it, Bob, don't
give me that.

25:40.100 --> 25:42.489
Stop pulling punches.

25:42.540 --> 25:44.701
You don't want to know
what I think.

25:44.760 --> 25:46.796
I have to.

25:46.840 --> 25:48.535
I've been ignoring the facts,

25:48.590 --> 25:50.535
hoping it'll all be okay.

25:50.590 --> 25:52.751
Tell me what you're thinking.

25:52.810 --> 25:57.725
If it was really a victory,
they'd be singing a
different tune.

25:57.770 --> 25:59.465
All this talk about
soldiers' bravery,

25:59.510 --> 26:01.944
nobody's saying a word
about achieved objectives.

26:01.990 --> 26:04.333
That's bad.

26:04.380 --> 26:07.907
That means they're dampening
our expectations, see?

26:07.950 --> 26:11.078
Gearing down before a
steep drop ahead.

26:11.130 --> 26:12.290
And Stanley?

26:12.350 --> 26:15.433
They leaned heavy on infantry.

26:15.480 --> 26:18.392
My reckoning, Royal Regiment
had big losses.

26:18.440 --> 26:20.874
The Brits always put our
boys up first...

26:20.920 --> 26:25.004
Stanley would've been
on the front lines.

26:25.060 --> 26:27.528
That's what I'm thinking, Lore.

26:27.580 --> 26:30.845
Thank you, Bob.

26:30.890 --> 26:35.361
Thank you for being honest.

26:46.950 --> 26:49.202
Are the soldiers settling,
Miss McRae?

26:49.250 --> 26:50.899
Yes Ma'am.
Working hard.

27:01.050 --> 27:05.259
Thank you, Miss McRae.

27:05.310 --> 27:07.358
Let's get back to work.

27:15.930 --> 27:17.932
Are you an art lover?

27:17.980 --> 27:20.540
Don't know a Da Vinci
from a doorknob.

27:20.590 --> 27:23.024
I'm sorry to drag
you back here,

27:23.070 --> 27:26.801
I just wanted to apologize
for the other day.

27:32.210 --> 27:35.816
Jimbo bragged you were a looker.

27:35.870 --> 27:39.169
Your photos, they don't
do you justice.

27:39.220 --> 27:40.118
Jimbo?

27:40.180 --> 27:43.126
He was so proud of you.

27:43.180 --> 27:45.910
Used to talk about you
working that bomb-factory.

27:45.960 --> 27:49.009
You mean cursing me for it.

27:49.050 --> 27:51.006
No.

27:51.060 --> 27:55.019
He told me a dozen times,
you had more spunk than
sixty girls stateside.

27:55.060 --> 27:58.188
How much you cared about the
boys and winning this thing.

27:58.240 --> 28:01.232
And here I am now,
sitting on my hands.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.328
Helping the enemy.

28:03.370 --> 28:05.326
How do you keep going,

28:05.370 --> 28:08.988
with everything
you've been through?

28:09.030 --> 28:12.113
You find your horizon,

28:12.160 --> 28:13.764
something to look at,

28:13.820 --> 28:16.778
and you put one foot
in front of the next.

28:16.820 --> 28:18.868
Even if you're limping.

28:18.910 --> 28:21.868
And I promise you,
Miss Witham,

28:21.910 --> 28:24.049
that's what Jimbo
would want.

28:24.090 --> 28:26.217
Especially now.

28:26.260 --> 28:28.876
It's a car.

28:28.920 --> 28:32.219
It's not James.

28:32.270 --> 28:39.927
I guess I just want something
to stand beyond him.

28:39.970 --> 28:41.972
Our mechanic is giving
it the once-over,

28:42.020 --> 28:44.068

the car tomorrow.

I dunno.

You're going to jail, Morettti.

it's not mine.

nothing was the same.

aren't coming back.

37:27.110 --> 37:29.101
Buster meets this guy,
no idea who.

37:29.150 --> 37:31.766
Offers him thirty bucks
for a tire of TNT.

37:31.810 --> 37:34.938
So Buster starts skimming it
till he has enough to sneak out.

37:34.990 --> 37:38.244
The truck comes back, there's
another thirty smackers.

37:38.290 --> 37:41.851
Look I saw a problem,
I did something about it.

37:41.910 --> 37:45.129
And a smuggler got caught,
And if you don't like it...

37:45.170 --> 37:47.081
No, I like it, I do.

37:47.130 --> 37:50.827
It's just, like I said

37:50.870 --> 37:53.259
men and women working together?

37:53.310 --> 37:56.393
It's a power-keg.

38:02.970 --> 38:04.403
Kaboom.

38:04.450 --> 38:07.317
Sorry.

38:08.980 --> 38:13.235
Just... don't do it again.

38:14.370 --> 38:15.371
We're friends, right?

38:15.420 --> 38:17.115
Friends, yeah of course.

38:21.690 --> 38:25.330
Nice to see people
having fun. Living.

38:25.390 --> 38:28.336
All the while, Europe's
in shambles.

38:28.390 --> 38:30.290
It's a world away.

38:30.350 --> 38:31.999
Not if you got a telephone.

38:32.040 --> 38:33.826
Or a know-it-all husband.

38:39.270 --> 38:42.524
Listen, I was talking to
Ellie upstairs while you were
changing.

38:42.580 --> 38:44.662
She's going to take
over the newsstand.

38:44.710 --> 38:46.359
Why would she do that?

38:46.410 --> 38:49.049
'Cause I'm going to visit
my brother in Perth County,

38:49.100 --> 38:50.840
help with the harvest.

38:50.890 --> 38:54.451
You heard the radio,
there's all this food
but no men to bring it in.

38:54.500 --> 38:56.843
They need farmers,
who can... farm.

38:56.890 --> 38:59.415
I can sort produce.

38:59.460 --> 39:01.109
And who knows what else.

39:01.160 --> 39:05.426
What I said before. I
was upset, I was angry.

39:05.470 --> 39:07.984
You were honest.

39:08.040 --> 39:09.382
Twenty-five years,

39:09.430 --> 39:11.079
I've been leaning on you.

39:11.130 --> 39:13.348
You don't need to
do this for me.

39:13.390 --> 39:16.860
Who sayes I am?
I'm doing this for myself.

39:16.910 --> 39:21.916
Though I think a some time apart
might be good for both of us.

39:21.960 --> 39:26.442
I'm playing the long
game here, Lore.

39:26.490 --> 39:30.403
I'm hoping that way maybe,

39:30.450 --> 39:32.884
maybe we can still win this.

39:40.070 --> 39:42.379
How'd my lawyer
work out for you?

39:42.420 --> 39:44.069
Easy job defending
an innocent man.

39:44.120 --> 39:45.417
Hey...

39:45.470 --> 39:47.597
You did good.

39:47.640 --> 39:51.076
Thanks for looking
after my mother.

39:51.120 --> 39:53.998
You'd have done the
same in my place.

39:54.040 --> 39:56.258
Cell-mates rough on you?

39:56.300 --> 39:58.734
Hell no.
This came from the guards.

39:58.780 --> 40:01.510
Yet here you are,
on their side.

40:01.570 --> 40:03.561
I don't know whose side I'm on.

40:11.750 --> 40:15.049
Big opportunity, Leon.
Don't mess it up.

40:15.100 --> 40:17.056
No sir.

40:17.110 --> 40:19.408
I just can't believe
that Buster...

40:19.460 --> 40:21.758
None of us can.
Good luck.

40:26.240 --> 40:27.719
Shouldn't have gone this way.

40:27.770 --> 40:30.375
I'll tell you where it's gone,
young lady.

40:30.420 --> 40:33.594
First off, what do you know
about the new lab downstairs?

40:33.640 --> 40:34.720
Not much.

40:34.780 --> 40:36.816
They're seconding
our office staff.

40:36.860 --> 40:39.033
You're just the
gal for the job.

40:39.080 --> 40:41.389
It's a promotion,
dollar a week raise.

40:41.430 --> 40:44.046
They asked for my best.

40:44.090 --> 40:46.046
You've proven yourself.

40:46.090 --> 40:47.603
Thank you.

40:56.190 --> 40:58.146
I'm so happy for you, Vera.

40:58.190 --> 41:01.444
You need that extra dollar
much more than I do.

41:04.850 --> 41:07.159
Get used to taking orders.

41:09.160 --> 41:11.378
Carol - She wanted shovels.
You bring shovels?

41:11.420 --> 41:13.149
Betty - Yeah I brought two.

41:13.200 --> 41:15.339
Kate - Must be a big project.

41:15.380 --> 41:17.462
What, she wants us
digging up potatoes?

41:17.510 --> 41:19.683
Naw, she said something
about planting.

41:19.730 --> 41:22.290
Good grief, what's that?

41:28.660 --> 41:30.434
Hello, ladies.

41:30.480 --> 41:32.528
We planting this?

41:32.570 --> 41:34.788
For James.

41:34.840 --> 41:35.829
C'mon, gals.

41:44.890 --> 41:47.404
Sure you don't need my help?

41:47.460 --> 41:48.882
We girls have got this.

41:48.940 --> 41:53.411
Thanks for the delivery.

41:53.460 --> 41:56.930
I was with him the
night he phoned you.

41:56.990 --> 41:58.332
The last night.

41:58.380 --> 42:02.510
We got separated
when the bombs fell.

42:02.560 --> 42:04.994
Every day I wonder,

42:05.040 --> 42:07.383
could I have done different.

42:07.430 --> 42:09.739
I'll never know.
And neither will you.

42:09.780 --> 42:11.953
And that's war,
Miss Witham.

42:14.920 --> 42:16.911
Go easy on third gear,

42:16.960 --> 42:18.518
it sticks.

42:18.570 --> 42:22.529
And watch, it pulls left
when she goes fast.

42:22.580 --> 42:26.448
Don't you worry,

42:26.500 --> 42:27.831
I won't push her.

42:45.040 --> 42:47.463
Gladys - Ladies?

42:47.520 --> 42:50.341
Gladys - Let's get
our hands dirty.
