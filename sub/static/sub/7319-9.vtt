WEBVTT

00:11.667 --> 00:13.833
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...
O'MALLEY.

00:13.867 --> 00:16.433
(O'Malleys) WHAT?
(Izzie) GEORGE'S DAD
GOT ADMITTED LAST NIGHT.

00:16.467 --> 00:18.033
IT'S JUST
A VALVE REPLACEMENT, GEORGE.

00:18.067 --> 00:19.667
BURKE WILL DO IT, AND YOU
WILL CLEAR HIS SCHEDULE.

00:19.700 --> 00:21.467
IF SOMEONE IS GONNA OPERATE
ON MY DAD'S HEART,

00:21.500 --> 00:23.533
I WANT IT TO BE BURKE.

00:23.567 --> 00:26.633
DR. HAHN HERE GRADUATED SECOND.
ASK HER WHO GRADUATED FIRST.

00:26.667 --> 00:30.200
ADELE AND I--SHE WANTS ME
TO STOP DOWN AS CHIEF, RETIRE.

00:30.233 --> 00:31.433
WE'RE STARTING FRESH.

00:31.467 --> 00:33.367
AND STARTING FRESH MEANS
NO SEX BECAUSE?

00:33.400 --> 00:35.800
BECAUSE WE STARTED WITH SEX
LAST TIME,

00:35.833 --> 00:37.533
AND IT DIDN'T GO
VERY WELL.

00:37.567 --> 00:39.667
YOU DECANNULATED
A HEART THIS MORNING.

00:39.700 --> 00:42.500
I DIDN'T DECANNULATE--
YES, YOU DID. AND WHEN
BURKE AND I WERE FISHING,

00:42.533 --> 00:44.700
I NOTICED SOMETHING WEIRD
WITH HIS HAND.

00:44.733 --> 00:47.300
I SLEPT WITH ANOTHER GUY.
DO I TELL GEORGE?

00:47.333 --> 00:48.533
CALLIE SLEPT WITH SLOAN.

00:48.567 --> 00:50.267
I SPENT THE ENTIRE DAY
WORRYING ABOUT BURKE.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.467
BURKE IS FINE.
YOUR DAD WILL BE FINE.

00:52.500 --> 00:54.167
YOU'RE LYING.

00:54.200 --> 00:57.067
BURKE IS HIDING SOMETHING,
AND YOU'RE HELPING HIM.
GEORGE KNOWS.

00:57.100 --> 01:00.100
(heart beating rhythmically)

01:02.067 --> 01:05.733
(Cristina) AS DOCTORS...

01:05.767 --> 01:08.400
WE KNOW EVERYBODY'S SECRETS--

01:08.433 --> 01:11.400
THEIR MEDICAL HISTORIES...

01:11.433 --> 01:13.633
SEXUAL HISTORIES...

01:13.667 --> 01:15.300
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

01:15.333 --> 01:19.433
THAT IS AS ESSENTIAL
TO A SURGEON AS 10-BLADE...

01:19.467 --> 01:21.333
(heartbeat continues)

01:21.367 --> 01:24.167
AND EVERY BIT AS DANGEROUS.

01:24.200 --> 01:26.067
(heartbeat continues)

01:26.067 --> 01:28.600
WE KEEP SECRETS.

01:28.633 --> 01:30.700
WE HAVE TO.

01:30.733 --> 01:34.467
(heavy breathing)

01:34.500 --> 01:36.333
(heartbeat continues)

01:36.367 --> 01:40.367
BUT NOT ALL SECRETS
CAN BE KEPT.

01:40.400 --> 01:43.500
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

01:54.567 --> 01:58.367
6-LETTER WORD
FOR PINNACLE.

01:58.400 --> 01:59.533
ZENITH.

01:59.567 --> 02:01.233
OH, THIS IS GOOD.

02:01.267 --> 02:03.400
NO SEX, CROSSWORD PUZZLES,
CURRENT EVENTS--

02:03.433 --> 02:05.133
WHEN'S THE KNITTING START?

02:05.167 --> 02:07.233
(laughs) SHUT UP.

02:07.267 --> 02:09.167
GOOD THINGS
COME TO THOSE WHO WAIT.

02:09.200 --> 02:11.200
YEAH? I WANT SEX.
(knock on door)

02:11.233 --> 02:13.733
THERE WILL BE NO SEX.
AM I INTERRUPTING SEX?

02:13.767 --> 02:16.067
(Derek) NO.
GOOD. GET OUT.

02:16.067 --> 02:17.733
WHAT? YOU CAN'T
ASK ME TO LEAVE.
MEREDITH.

02:17.767 --> 02:20.433
WE'RE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF...

02:21.667 --> 02:23.500
GIVE US A SEC.

02:23.533 --> 02:26.133
MMM.

02:26.167 --> 02:28.067
WHEN I GET BACK,
THERE'D BETTER BE SOME SEX.

02:28.100 --> 02:29.833
WHY ARE YOU ALL SWEATY
AND ICK?

02:29.867 --> 02:31.367
I JOGGED HERE.

02:31.400 --> 02:34.067
WE DON'T JOG.
YOU DON'T JOG.

02:36.267 --> 02:37.200
CRISTINA--

02:37.233 --> 02:39.133
WHAT IF DEREK
ROBBED A BANK?

02:39.167 --> 02:40.467
WHAT?

02:40.500 --> 02:42.067
SAY DEREK WAS ROBBING
A BANK,

02:42.100 --> 02:43.833
AND WHILE HE WAS IN THERE,
YOU WERE WAITING OUTSIDE

02:43.867 --> 02:45.767
BECAUSE IT WAS YOUR JOB
TO DRIVE THE GETAWAY CAR.

02:45.800 --> 02:47.667
WHY WOULD DEREK
ROB A BANK?
JUST GO WITH ME, PLEASE.

02:47.700 --> 02:50.067
OKAY, DEREK'S ROBBING
A BANK.
AND HE GETS CAUGHT.

02:50.067 --> 02:51.500
BUT NO ONE KNOWS
YOU WERE INVOLVED

02:51.533 --> 02:53.267
'CAUSE YOU WERE DRIVING
THE CAR.

02:53.300 --> 02:55.267
OKAY, DEREK'S IN JAIL,
I'M IN THE MYSTERY CAR.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.200
WHAT'S THE QUESTION?

02:57.233 --> 02:58.600
WOULD YOU TURN YOURSELF IN,

02:58.633 --> 03:00.533
OR WOULD YOU STAY QUIET
AND LET DEREK GO DOWN

03:00.567 --> 03:03.467
FOR A ROBBERY IN WHICH YOU
WERE A COMPLICIT PARTICIPANT?

03:03.500 --> 03:05.600
OR WOULD YOU, YOU KNOW,
STAND BY HIM?

03:05.633 --> 03:08.733
WELL... WHOSE IDEA
WAS IT TO ROB THE BANK?

03:08.767 --> 03:10.667
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.

03:10.700 --> 03:13.433
HIS, BUT... YOU HELPED.

03:13.467 --> 03:15.367
I MEAN, COULD YOU LIVE
WITH YOURSELF

03:15.400 --> 03:18.267
IF YOU JUST WALKED AWAY
AND LET THE MAN YOU LOVE

03:18.300 --> 03:21.067
TAKE THE FALL?

03:21.067 --> 03:25.733
IF YOU TELL ME,
MAYBE I CAN HELP.

03:26.867 --> 03:29.067
NO, I'LL SEE--
I'LL SEE YOU AT WORK.

03:31.367 --> 03:33.400
CRISTINA, YOU DON'T JOG.

03:34.767 --> 03:37.533
WE DON'T JOG.

03:37.567 --> 03:40.200
HAS GEORGE
SAID ANYTHING TO YOU?

03:40.233 --> 03:42.300
ABOUT WHAT?

03:44.233 --> 03:47.167
I JOG SOMETIMES...

03:47.200 --> 03:49.733
WITHOUT YOU.

03:51.600 --> 03:54.067
(door closes)

04:03.833 --> 04:06.367
HOW'S YOUR DAD?

04:06.400 --> 04:07.767
HIS SURGERY IS TODAY.

04:07.800 --> 04:09.200
YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

04:09.233 --> 04:10.833
I'M NOT WORRIED,
NOT ANYMORE.

04:10.867 --> 04:12.500
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY THAT?

04:12.533 --> 04:14.067
HEY.

04:14.067 --> 04:15.800
SO ARE YOU AND MEREDITH
HAVING ONE OF YOUR

04:15.833 --> 04:18.433
"WE'RE BEST FRIENDS, WE'RE
SO COOL" SECRET TIME THINGS?

04:18.467 --> 04:20.333
SORRY, I'M CRANKY.

04:20.367 --> 04:22.267
CANDY STRIPING
MAKES ME SO CRANKY.

04:22.300 --> 04:23.600
CRISTINA'S LEAVING.

04:23.633 --> 04:26.400
(Derek) AH, SO I CAN HAVE
MY GIRLFRIEND BACK.

04:28.433 --> 04:31.800
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

04:33.200 --> 04:34.800
(Meredith laughs)
(Derek) WHOA, WHOA.

04:34.833 --> 04:37.200
(Meredith and Derek laugh)

04:43.600 --> 04:45.700
WHY ARE YOU ACTING LIKE
THE SKY IS FALLING?

04:45.733 --> 04:48.200
THE SKY ISN'T FALLING.
IT ALREADY FELL. GEORGE KNOWS.

04:48.233 --> 04:50.133
I WAS IN SURGERY
FOR 14 HOURS YESTERDAY,

04:50.167 --> 04:51.400
AND NO TREMOR.

04:51.433 --> 04:54.133
YEAH, WITH ME BY YOUR SIDE,
READY TO JUMP IN.

04:54.167 --> 04:57.600
I HAVEN'T HAD A TREMOR
IN A WEEK.
GEORGE KNOWS.
AND THIS IS NOT ANY SURGERY.

04:57.633 --> 05:01.767
YOU ARE OPERATING
ON HIS FATHER TODAY.
I AM AWARE OF THAT,
AND I AM FINE.

05:01.800 --> 05:03.700
WELL, HE'S GONNA DO SOMETHING.
I KNOW HIM.

05:03.733 --> 05:06.733
HE'S NOT GONNA JUST STAND BY
AND SAY NOTHING.
THERE'S NOTHING TO SAY.

05:06.767 --> 05:08.733
I HAD A TREMOR.
NOW I DON'T.

05:08.767 --> 05:10.267
WE NEED A STRATEGY.

05:10.300 --> 05:13.133
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT OUR STORY
AND COME UP WITH A PLAN.

05:13.167 --> 05:16.067
OH, CRISTINA,
YOU'RE TOO INTENSE.

05:16.067 --> 05:17.800
I AM TOO INTENSE?

05:17.833 --> 05:19.733
I HAVE BEEN
WORKING MY ASS OFF

05:19.767 --> 05:21.233
MAKING SURE
NOBODY HERE KNOWS,

05:21.267 --> 05:23.167
RUNNING YOUR BOARD,
LEARNING SURGICAL PROCEDURES

05:23.200 --> 05:26.067
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO KNOW UNTIL
MY FIFTH YEAR COVERING YOU.

05:26.067 --> 05:28.833
COVERING ME? AND I HAVEN'T
BEEN COVERING YOU?

05:28.867 --> 05:31.300
EXCUSE ME?

05:31.333 --> 05:33.500
(sighs) I'M JUST SAYING...

05:33.533 --> 05:35.300
WE'RE A TEAM...

05:35.333 --> 05:36.233
OKAY.

05:36.267 --> 05:38.400
A STRONG TEAM,
AND I WOULDN'T BE IN THAT O.R.

05:38.433 --> 05:41.067
IF I DIDN'T KNOW
I COULD DO IT,

05:41.100 --> 05:42.833
AND YOU JUST HAVE TO
TRUST ME ON THAT.

05:42.867 --> 05:44.767
DON'T LET THIS O'MALLEY THING
BREAK YOU DOWN.

05:44.800 --> 05:47.533
NO, I'M NOT.

05:47.567 --> 05:49.067
CRISTINA--
(pager beeps)

05:49.100 --> 05:51.567
I GOTTA--I GOTTA GO.

05:51.600 --> 05:53.833
(pager beeps)

05:53.867 --> 05:56.500
WHAT HAPPENED?

05:56.533 --> 05:58.433
DRIVER LOST CONTROL
OF HIS CAR,

05:58.467 --> 06:00.367
PLOWED THROUGH
THE FISH MARKET AT THE WARF.

06:00.400 --> 06:03.267
AT LEAST A DOZEN INJURIES.
I NEED ALL HANDS ON DECK.

06:03.300 --> 06:05.367
ALL HANDS? DOES THAT
MEAN "ALL HANDS,"

06:05.400 --> 06:07.100
OR JUST ALL HANDS?

06:07.133 --> 06:09.067
STEVENS, UH, YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN PAGED.

06:09.067 --> 06:10.800
YOU CAN, UH, GO AND TAKE OVER
ON MR. O'MALLEY.

06:10.833 --> 06:12.667
HE'S HAVING HIS SURGERY TODAY
WITH DR. BURKE.

06:12.700 --> 06:14.600
UH, THAT'S MY CASE.
I'M WITH BURKE.
YOU HAVE TRAUMAS
ROLLING INTO THE PIT.

06:14.633 --> 06:16.400
SHE CAN TAKE OVER
FOR YOU.

06:16.433 --> 06:17.733
SO I GET TO SCRUB IN?
THANKS.

06:17.767 --> 06:20.267
BUT--
STEVENS, YOU WILL NOT
SCRUB IN.

06:20.300 --> 06:21.667
YOU WILL NOT HANDLE
ANY INSTRUMENTS.

06:21.700 --> 06:23.600
YOU WILL NOT MOVE OR TALK
OR DO ANYTHING

06:23.633 --> 06:25.567
OTHER THAN BREATHE AND WATCH.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.400
CANDY STRIPING AGAIN.
NO PROBLEM.

06:27.433 --> 06:30.067
WHERE IS GEORGE?
WHY ISN'T HE HERE?

06:30.100 --> 06:32.200
I DON'T KNOW.
HE SWITCHED SHIFTS WITH ME.

06:32.233 --> 06:35.133
DR. BAILEY...
UM, I JUST WANTED TO SAY,

06:35.167 --> 06:37.067
DR. BURKE REQUESTED ME
ON THE O'MALLEY CASE,

06:37.100 --> 06:38.667
SO IF I HAVE TO GO...

06:38.700 --> 06:40.533
I MEAN, IZZIE CAN'T EVEN
SCRUB IN,

06:40.567 --> 06:42.700
SO IF AND WHEN MY ATTENDING
ASKS FOR ME--

06:42.733 --> 06:45.500
WELL, IF AND WHEN

06:45.533 --> 06:48.233
THEN YOU HAVE TO GO,
DON'T YOU?

06:48.267 --> 06:49.300
(people yelling indistinctly)

06:49.333 --> 06:52.067
GREY, TRAUMA ROOM ONE.
YANG, MAN THAT STRETCHER.

06:52.067 --> 06:53.833
KAREV, COME WITH ME.

06:53.867 --> 06:56.067
ALL RIGHT, TALK TO ME.
LARRY SHANE DICKERSON, 86,

06:56.100 --> 06:58.233
G.C.S. 8,
B.P. OF 100 OVER PALP,

06:58.267 --> 07:01.067
PULSE IN THE 120s.
OBVIOUS DEFORMITIES
TO THE RIGHT TIB/FIB.

07:01.100 --> 07:02.533
GET X-RAYS. LET ME KNOW
IF THERE'S ANYTHING SURGICAL.

07:02.567 --> 07:05.067
LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOT A LOT WORSE
PROBLEMS THAN A BROKEN LEG.

07:05.067 --> 07:06.433
HONEY,
LET ME HEAR YOUR VOICE.

07:06.467 --> 07:09.333
THAT CAR, THAT CAR--
IT JUST ABOUT KILLED HIM.

07:09.367 --> 07:11.133
THE CAR HIT HIM?
NO, HE WAS DRIVING.

07:11.167 --> 07:13.100
HIT HIS HEAD ON THE WINDSHIELD,
CHEST HIT THE STEERING COLUMN.

07:13.133 --> 07:14.333
OLD CAR, NO AIRBAGS.

07:14.367 --> 07:16.500
HE WAS DRIVING THE CAR THAT
CRASHED INTO THE FISH MARKET?

07:16.533 --> 07:19.100
HE WASN'T DRIVING IT.
THAT'S WHAT I'M TELLING YOU.

07:19.133 --> 07:21.067
IT WAS DRIVING HIM.
HE DIDN'T DO ALL THIS.

07:21.067 --> 07:22.800
IT WAS THE CAR.
HE COULDN'T STOP IT.

07:22.833 --> 07:24.133
OKAY. LEFT PUPIL
IS SLUGGISH.

07:24.167 --> 07:25.733
MRS. DICKERSON,

07:25.767 --> 07:27.500
DR. YANG IS GONNA TAKE
YOUR HUSBAND OVER TO RADIOLOGY.

07:27.533 --> 07:30.100
AND, MRS. DICKERSON,
THERE ARE TWO POLICE OFFICERS

07:30.133 --> 07:32.633
WAITING TO TAKE YOUR STATEMENT
ABOUT THE ACCIDENT.
IT WAS THE CAR.

07:32.667 --> 07:35.533
SEE, HE DROPPED ME OFF, HE WENT
TO PARK LIKE HE ALWAYS DOES.
OKAY.

07:35.567 --> 07:37.167
LARRY IS A GOOD DRIVER.
ALL RIGHT.

07:37.200 --> 07:38.500
PLEASE, I WANT TO BE
WITH MY HUSBAND.

07:38.533 --> 07:40.500
YES, MRS. DICKERSON, BUT JUST
GIVE THE STATEMENT--

07:40.533 --> 07:42.433
NOT NOW!
(whispers) PLEASE.

07:45.233 --> 07:46.600
OKAY, UH...
ALL--ALL RIGHT,

07:46.633 --> 07:48.533
I'LL--I'LL ASK THEM
TO COME BACK LATER.

07:48.567 --> 07:50.800
LET'S GO.

07:53.867 --> 07:56.233
(woman) HE'S CRASHING.
I NEED SUCTION HERE.

07:56.267 --> 07:59.067
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

08:00.500 --> 08:02.533
SHOULD WE SHOCK HIM AGAIN?

08:02.567 --> 08:04.800
SHOCKING IS NOT GONNA HELP
A HEART WITH NO BLOOD TO PUMP.

08:04.833 --> 08:06.400
DAMN IT.
THERE ARE CLOTS EVERYWHERE.

08:06.433 --> 08:09.133
IF I COULD JUST GET
BETTER VISUALIZATION...

08:09.167 --> 08:11.633
(Addison) SO YOU SAID YOU WERE
INSIDE OF THE FISH MARKET

08:11.667 --> 08:15.800
WHEN THIS HAPPENED?
OKAY, I NEED YOU TO GET HER...

08:15.833 --> 08:17.467
MA'AM?

08:17.500 --> 08:19.833
MA'AM?

08:19.867 --> 08:22.567
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)
CALL IT, GREY.

08:22.600 --> 08:26.233
TIME OF DEATH--7:53 A.M.

08:26.267 --> 08:27.633
(Addison) MA'AM?

08:32.133 --> 08:35.133
PRESTON BURKE--
BACK FROM THE DEAD.

08:36.133 --> 08:38.767
CAN'T SAY THE SAME
FOR YOUR PATIENT.

08:38.800 --> 08:40.433
MA'AM?!

08:40.467 --> 08:42.367
MA--I NEED A STRETCHER
OVER HERE.

08:42.400 --> 08:45.733
I THINK I MIGHT BE PARKED
IN A RED ZONE.

08:45.767 --> 08:53.400
OH! I NEED
A STRETCHER, PLEASE!

09:03.100 --> 09:06.067
AWESOME CUTS.

09:06.100 --> 09:08.500
I FLEW THROUGH A WINDOW.
I FLEW.

09:08.533 --> 09:09.667
KAREV.
STOP MANHANDLING MY INTERN.
THAT'S MY JOB.

09:09.700 --> 09:11.300
(Addison)
CAN YOU TELL ME YOUR NAME?
JANELLE DUCO.

09:11.333 --> 09:15.200
JANELLE, WHAT DO YOU DO
FOR A LIVING?
I SELL VEGETABLES
AT THE FISH MARKET.

09:15.233 --> 09:16.567
(Mrs. Dickerson)
JANELLE, HONEY,

09:16.600 --> 09:18.600
CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING?
SOME FOOD MAYBE?

09:18.633 --> 09:20.767
MRS. DICKERSON,
IS THAT YOU?

09:20.800 --> 09:22.800
MRS. DICKERSON, I'M SORRY.
YOU CAN'T BE HERE RIGHT NOW.

09:22.833 --> 09:25.067
LARRY IS A GOOD DRIVER.
THE CAR WENT CRAZY.

09:25.067 --> 09:26.800
JANELLE, IF--IF YOU
NEED ANYTHING,

09:26.833 --> 09:29.533
I'LL BE RIGHT OVER HERE.
(Cristina) OH, I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY. COME WITH ME.

09:29.567 --> 09:30.800
SHE'S MY BEST CUSTOMER.

09:30.833 --> 09:33.733
SHE COLLAPSED IN MY ARMS. I JUST
WANT TO MAKE SURE SHE'S OKAY.

09:33.767 --> 09:36.300
YOU GOT IT FROM HERE?
THEY DON'T CALL ME "DOCTOR"
FOR NOTHING.

09:36.333 --> 09:39.100
MR. DICKERSON
IS SUCH A NICE MAN.

09:39.133 --> 09:41.267
I HOPE HE DIDN'T KILL
MY BABY.

09:42.833 --> 09:45.500
ADDISON! SHE'S PREGNANT.

09:45.533 --> 09:49.567
I NEED AN ULTRASOUND.
HOW FAR ALONG ARE YOU?
TEN WEEKS. OW!

09:49.600 --> 09:50.633
SORRY.

09:50.667 --> 09:53.533
THERE'S GLASS IN THERE, KAREV.
TRY A LIGHTER TOUGH.

09:53.567 --> 09:56.067
THE DOCTORS... HOT MEN.

09:56.067 --> 09:58.067
THEY'RE ALL REALLY HOT.

09:58.067 --> 09:59.433
THEY ARE, AREN'T THEY?

09:59.467 --> 10:02.333
IT'S NOT JUST 'CAUSE I'M WEARING
A PLATE-GLASS WINDOW?

10:02.367 --> 10:04.133
NO, THEY'RE MAN-CANDY.

10:04.167 --> 10:08.833
GOOD. (coughing)

10:08.867 --> 10:11.100
OKAY, THAT IS NASTY.

10:11.133 --> 10:13.700
HER SATS ARE IN THE 80s.
I'VE GOT TO GET HER OXYGEN.

10:13.733 --> 10:16.567
AND I'M GONNA NEED
A PORTABLE CHEST, STAT.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.833
I LOVE THE BOSSING.
BOSS MORE.

10:18.867 --> 10:21.367
(monitor beeping)

10:21.400 --> 10:22.633
HEY, IZZIE.

10:22.667 --> 10:25.500
HONEY, THIS IS IZZIE.
HI.

10:25.533 --> 10:28.167
OH, YES. ONE OF THE GIRLS
WHO LIVES WITH GEORGIE

10:28.200 --> 10:30.100
IN SOME KIND
OF SETUP THERE.

10:30.133 --> 10:31.767
IT'S NOT SOME KIND
OF SETUP.

10:31.800 --> 10:33.700
IT'S LIKE WHAT THEY DO
THESE DAYS.

10:33.733 --> 10:36.600
MEN AND WOMEN LIVE TOGETHER
WITHOUT BEING...

10:36.633 --> 10:39.600
YOU KNOW... MEN AND WOMEN.

10:39.633 --> 10:42.100
IT'S LIKE
A NEUTRAL THING, HUH?

10:42.133 --> 10:44.700
SO NOTHING SEXUAL?
MOM!

10:44.733 --> 10:47.233
(laughs) NO.
NOTHING SEXUAL.

10:47.267 --> 10:49.433
WHERE ARE THE OTHER
O'MALLEY MEN TODAY?

10:49.467 --> 10:52.200
I TOLD 'EM
TO GET BACK TO WORK.

10:52.233 --> 10:54.267
THEY WERE CLIMBING
THE WALLS IN HERE.
WELL, I'M HERE TO PREP YOU
FOR SURGERY.

10:54.300 --> 10:56.300
AS YOU KNOW, DR. BURKE
IS YOUR SURGEON.
DR. BURKE--RIGHT.

10:56.333 --> 10:57.767
GEORGIE'S ALWAYS SAYING

10:57.800 --> 11:00.400
"DR. BURKE THIS,
DR. BURKE THAT."
(Izzie) YEAH,
HE'S PRETTY INCREDIBLE.

11:00.433 --> 11:02.267
(pager beeps)
HE'S ONE OF THE BEST
CARDIOTHORACIC GUYS

11:02.300 --> 11:04.667
IN THE WORLD.
(George) YEAH.

11:04.700 --> 11:07.433
UM, I HAVE TO GO.
I'M GONNA BE RIGHT BACK.

11:07.467 --> 11:11.633
YOU'RE NOT EVEN WORKING TODAY.
WHY ARE YOU GETTING PAGED?
I HAVE TO GO.

11:11.667 --> 11:13.700
YOU'RE PRETTY.

11:13.733 --> 11:15.633
THERE'S NOTHING SEXUAL
BETWEEN YOU AND GEORGIE,

11:15.667 --> 11:17.200
NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT?

11:17.233 --> 11:18.433
LOUISE!

11:18.467 --> 11:19.833
WHAT?

11:19.867 --> 11:21.767
I JUST WANT GEORGIE
TO BE HAPPY.

11:21.800 --> 11:23.633
OKAY.

11:23.667 --> 11:25.567
LET'S JUST PREP YOU
FOR SURGERY.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.500
ANYTHING YOU WOULD'VE
DONE DIFFERENT, DR. HAHN?

11:27.533 --> 11:31.367
GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE WOUND,
I WOULD'VE GIVEN UP SOONER.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.333
SO HOW HAVE YOU BEEN,
PRESTON?

11:33.367 --> 11:36.233
LAST TIME I SAW YOU,
YOU STOLE MY PATIENT'S HEART.

11:36.267 --> 11:38.400
THEN YOU GOT SHOT.
KARMA ROCKS.

11:38.433 --> 11:40.333
WHAT BRINGS YOU ALL THE WAY

11:40.367 --> 11:42.167
FROM SEATTLE PRESBYTERIAN
TO SEATTLE GRACE?

11:42.200 --> 11:45.367
A CONSULT, AND KNOWING HOW MUCH
MY BEING HERE WOULD ANNOY YOU.

11:45.400 --> 11:48.667
OH, ON THE CONTRARY,
IT'S ALWAYS A PLEASURE,

11:48.700 --> 11:51.233
BUT NOT AS MUCH
AS WHEN YOU LEAVE.

11:55.133 --> 11:58.367
HEY, DO YOU THINK I COULD
GET IN ON ERICA HAHN'S SURGERY?

11:58.400 --> 11:59.733
I'VE HEARD SHE'S AMAZING.
WHO?

11:59.767 --> 12:01.667
DR. HAHN.
SHE'S DOING A CONSULT.

12:01.700 --> 12:04.333
I WONDER WHO THE V.I.P.
PATIENT IS.

12:09.800 --> 12:12.300
UM, GET HIM--
GET HIM TO C.T.

12:12.333 --> 12:13.633
WH--

12:15.167 --> 12:17.067
MARIA, MAY I HAVE
MY FATHER'S CHART?

12:17.100 --> 12:18.833
DR. HAHN...
I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED

12:18.867 --> 12:20.767
TO HEAR YOU WERE
JOINING US TODAY.

12:20.800 --> 12:23.567
OH, WELL, I'M ALWAYS READY
TO LEND A HAND, DR. WEBBER.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.500
GEORGE.
HEY, HOW'S YOUR DAD?

12:25.533 --> 12:27.667
UH, HERE IS HIS CHART.

12:27.700 --> 12:29.100
HE'S IN ROOM 3975.

12:29.133 --> 12:31.100
IT'S DOWN THE HALL,
THIRD DOOR ON THE RIGHT.

12:31.133 --> 12:32.800
I'LL BE THERE IN A MINUTE.
OKAY.

12:32.833 --> 12:34.667
I'LL ESCORT YOU,
AND YOU CAN TELL ME

12:34.700 --> 12:37.633
WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO STEAL YOU
AWAY FROM SEATTLE PRESBYTERIAN.

12:37.667 --> 12:40.700
WE COULD USE AN EXTRA HAND
AROUND HERE.

12:42.700 --> 12:43.633
CALLIE.

12:43.667 --> 12:44.600
HEY.

12:44.633 --> 12:46.533
WE BROKE UP.
YOU BROKE UP WITH ME.

12:46.567 --> 12:48.467
UNLESS I'M MISSING SOMETHING?

12:48.500 --> 12:50.133
THAT DOESN'T MEAN...

12:50.167 --> 12:52.333
I'M JUST ASKING
ABOUT YOUR DAD.
WHY?

12:52.367 --> 12:54.367
WHY DO YOU CARE?

12:54.400 --> 12:56.067
BECAUSE I CARE ABOUT YOU.

12:56.100 --> 12:58.800
RIGHT. WELL, I GUESS THAT'S WHY
YOU SLEPT WITH MARK SLOAN, HUH?

12:58.833 --> 13:01.100
THAT MAKES SENSE.

13:08.100 --> 13:09.800
DID DR. BAILEY SEE
THE CHEST X-RAY?

13:09.833 --> 13:11.733
NO, BUT WITH
THE DECREASED BREATH SOUNDS

13:11.767 --> 13:13.733
AND THE LOW PULSE OX,

13:13.767 --> 13:15.667
SHE SUSPECTS JANELLE
WILL NEED A CHEST TUBE.

13:15.700 --> 13:17.567
I'M DABBING OUT FREAKIN'
GLASS SPLINTERS,

13:17.600 --> 13:20.433
AND SHE GETS TO DO
A CHEST TUBE?
YOU SIGNED ON FOR THIS.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.367
THIS IS NOT A GOOD DAY FOR ME.

13:22.400 --> 13:25.100
THIS IS NOT A GOOD DAY
FOR ME AT ALL.
THE BABY LOOKS GOOD, JANELLE.

13:25.133 --> 13:27.067
HEARTBEAT'S STRONG. DO YOU WANT
ME TO CALL THE FATHER?

13:27.067 --> 13:28.600
YOU COULD DO THAT,
BUT THAT WOULD REQUIRE ME

13:28.633 --> 13:30.533
SPEAKING TO HIM,
WHICH I NO LONGER DO.

13:30.567 --> 13:32.733
PLUS, HEARING HE'S A DADDY
FROM SOME RANDOM DOCTOR

13:32.767 --> 13:35.367
MIGHT NOT GO OVER REAL WELL.
SO THE BABY'S FATHER
DOESN'T KNOW.

13:35.400 --> 13:37.733
NO, AND HE'S NEVER GOING TO.

13:37.767 --> 13:40.133
GREY, CAN I SPEAK WITH YOU?

13:40.167 --> 13:42.067
UM, I'M SETTING UP
A CHEST TUBE.

13:42.100 --> 13:44.100
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
WHEN YOU'RE DONE.
I'LL COME FIND YOU.

13:44.133 --> 13:46.433
YOU KNOW, I CAN SUTURE.
I'VE DONE IT BEFORE.

13:46.467 --> 13:48.767
WHEN YOU CAN DO A Z-PLASTY
AND BARELY SEE THE SCAR,

13:48.800 --> 13:50.733
GIVE ME A CALL.

13:50.767 --> 13:52.667
TILL THEN, DAB AND CLEAN,
DAB AND CLEAN.

13:52.700 --> 13:54.400
HOW'S PLASTICS, KAREV?

13:54.433 --> 13:56.567
EVERYTHING
YOU'VE EVER DREAMED OF?

13:56.600 --> 13:59.400
UH, WE'RE NOT DOING
A CHEST TUBE, DR. GREY.

13:59.433 --> 14:00.667
WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:00.700 --> 14:05.700
MS. DUCO, THERE'S A SHARD
OF GLASS GOING INTO YOUR HEART.

14:09.767 --> 14:11.667
HEY.
HEY.

14:11.700 --> 14:13.600
HAVE YOU SEEN DR. TORRES?

14:13.633 --> 14:16.067
NO. QUITE A MORNING, HUH?
14 INJURED, 2 DEAD.

14:16.100 --> 14:17.700
I KNOW.
THERE'S A LOT OF BLOOD...

14:17.733 --> 14:19.100
YEAH.
AND BLOOD.

14:19.133 --> 14:21.600
YOU KNOW, THERE'S A GIRL
WHO LITERALLY HAS

14:21.633 --> 14:23.533
A SHARD OF GLASS
IN HER CHEST.
COME HERE.

14:23.567 --> 14:25.267
LARRY DICKERSON--

14:25.300 --> 14:27.200
THE GUY THAT CRASHED INTO
THE FISH MARKET.

14:27.233 --> 14:28.400
(Derek)
IT'S A SUBDURAL HEMATOMA

14:28.433 --> 14:30.100
ALONG WITH AIR
IN HIS MEDIASTINUM.

14:30.133 --> 14:31.767
NOW LOOK AT THIS,
LOOK AT HIS SPINE RIGHT HERE.

14:31.800 --> 14:33.300
SPINAL STENOSIS.
YEP.

14:33.333 --> 14:36.133
NARROWING OF THE SPINE,
MOST OFTEN A RESULT OF AGING.

14:36.167 --> 14:38.067
CAUSES NUMBNESS
IN THE LEGS AND FEET.

14:38.100 --> 14:39.833
HIS CASE IS SO FAR ADVANCED,

14:39.867 --> 14:42.100
I DOUBT HE COULD EVEN
FEEL HIS FEET,

14:42.133 --> 14:43.767
WHICH MEANS--
OH, HE SHOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN DRIVING.

14:43.800 --> 14:47.067
YOU PAGED ME?
PATIENT HAS AIR
IN THE MEDIASTINUM.

14:47.067 --> 14:48.800
WANTED YOU TO TAKE A LOOK.

14:48.833 --> 14:51.367
OH, THIS GUY
SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN DRIVING.
I KNOW.

14:51.400 --> 14:53.067
IT LOOKS LIKE HE HAS
A TRACHEAL INJURY.

14:53.100 --> 14:56.733
YOU GOING INTO THE O.R.
FOR THE SUBDURAL?
YEAH, AS SOON AS ONE
BECOMES AVAILABLE.

14:56.767 --> 14:58.367
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH CRISTINA?

14:59.867 --> 15:01.067
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

15:01.067 --> 15:03.733
WELL, FIRST SHE KICKS ME
OUT OF BED AT 5:00 THIS MORNING

15:03.767 --> 15:05.500
SO SHE CAN HAVE GIRL TALK
WITH MEREDITH,

15:05.533 --> 15:08.433
AND NOW I CAN'T FIND HER. SHE
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MY INTERN.

15:08.467 --> 15:11.233
I HAD TO GET MY OWN C.T.
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

15:11.267 --> 15:13.267
NOTHING.
CRISTINA'S FINE.

15:13.300 --> 15:16.400
SHE'S JUST WORKING
REALLY HARD.

15:16.433 --> 15:18.800
I'M SURE I DON'T HAVE
ANY IDEA. (chuckles)

15:18.833 --> 15:20.733
(laughs)

15:20.767 --> 15:23.767
DON'T MENTION CRISTINA
TO BURKE, OKAY?

15:23.800 --> 15:25.333
IT'S JUST NOT A GOOD IDEA.

15:25.367 --> 15:27.533
YEAH? WHAT DID YOU
TALK ABOUT THIS MORNING?

15:27.567 --> 15:29.567
BANK ROBBERIES...

15:29.600 --> 15:31.633
WHICH ISN'T REALLY
THE POINT, OKAY?

15:31.667 --> 15:33.600
SHE WAS JOGGING,
AND WELL...

15:33.633 --> 15:35.800
JUST CUT HER SOME SLACK
TODAY, OKAY?

15:35.833 --> 15:37.567
NOT THAT
I SHOULD INTERFERE--

15:37.600 --> 15:39.500
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO ANYWAY.

15:39.533 --> 15:41.100
(sighs)

15:41.133 --> 15:44.133
I'M JUST GONNA ASK ONCE,
VERY NICELY.

15:44.167 --> 15:46.267
PLEASE.

15:46.300 --> 15:47.733
PLEASE.

15:47.767 --> 15:49.833
YOU KNOW WHAT SAYS "THANK YOU"
LIKE NOTHING ELSE?

15:49.867 --> 15:51.700
(mouths word)

15:51.733 --> 15:55.100
(laughs)
I'M LEAVING NOW.

15:55.133 --> 15:56.567
(giggles)

16:07.067 --> 16:08.800
HEY, UH, DEREK'S
LOOKING FOR YOU.

16:08.833 --> 16:10.733
HE SAID YOU LEFT
A PATIENT IN THE C.T.--

16:10.767 --> 16:12.233
SHH, SHH, SHH.

16:12.267 --> 16:13.633
I'M TRYING TO HEAR.

16:13.667 --> 16:15.233
(Meredith) WHAT'S GOING ON?

16:16.767 --> 16:19.067
(crinkles paper)

16:20.800 --> 16:22.333
DR. YANG.

16:22.367 --> 16:23.800
YES, SIR.

16:23.833 --> 16:26.700
WHEN YOU SEE DR. BURKE, TELL HIM
I NEED TO SPEAK WITH HIM.

16:26.733 --> 16:28.267
OF COURSE, SIR.

16:28.300 --> 16:30.500
UH, IS THAT, UH, DR. HAHN
FROM PRESBYTERIAN

16:30.533 --> 16:32.067
TALKING TO GEORGE'S DAD?

16:32.067 --> 16:35.267
MR. O'MALLEY HAS ELECTED
TO HAVE DR. HAHN

16:35.300 --> 16:37.200
PERFORM HIS VALVE REPLACEMENT.

16:37.233 --> 16:38.800
UM, BUT WHAT ABOUT
DR. BURKE?

16:38.833 --> 16:40.700
DR. BURKE'S BEEN REPLACED.

16:54.600 --> 16:57.167
WELL, SO WHAT IF HE REPLACED ME
WITH DR. HAHN?

16:57.200 --> 16:59.700
I'M NO LONGER
ON HIS FATHER'S SURGERY.

16:59.733 --> 17:01.767
THAT'S A GOOD THING IF IT MEANS
YOU STOP OBSESSING.
GEORGE DIDN'T JUST REPLACE YOU.
HE TOLD THE CHIEF.

17:01.800 --> 17:03.767
THE CHIEF KNOWS.
I MEAN, FOR ALL WE KNOW,

17:03.800 --> 17:06.700
ERICA HAHN'S BEING CONSIDERED
THE NEW HEAD OF CARDIO.

17:06.733 --> 17:08.633
AND THE CHIEF ASKED ME
TO TELL YOU

17:08.667 --> 17:11.300
THAT HE HAS SOMETHING IMPORTANT
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

17:11.333 --> 17:13.433
OH, OKAY.

17:13.467 --> 17:15.367
SO WE NEED TO ALIGN
OUR STORIES.

17:15.400 --> 17:17.233
THIS IS WHY I FEEL LIKE
I'M COVERING FOR YOU.

17:17.267 --> 17:19.233
I DON'T LINE UP STORIES.
THAT'S NOT ME.

17:19.267 --> 17:21.767
OH, I'M SORRY. YOU THINK
IT'S ME? THAT'S NOT FAIR.

17:21.800 --> 17:22.900
YOU KNOW, IT'S DONE.

17:22.933 --> 17:25.800
THE CHIEF WANTS TO TALK TO ME,
SO I WILL TALK TO HIM.

17:25.833 --> 17:27.733
I AM NOT TELLING HIM
A STORY, CRISTINA.

17:27.767 --> 17:29.700
I'M GONNA TELL HIM
THE TRUTH.

17:29.733 --> 17:33.300
BURKE. BURKE.

17:33.333 --> 17:35.433
(door slams)

17:35.467 --> 17:37.667
STILL GETTING
A HEARTBEAT THERE?
HAPPY TO SAY.

17:37.700 --> 17:40.200
AND IT'LL GET STRONGER
ONCE YOU'VE HAD YOUR SURGERY.

17:40.233 --> 17:42.367
DO YOU MIND ME ASKING
WHY YOU GUYS SWITCHED

17:42.400 --> 17:44.133
FROM DR. BURKE TO DR. HAHN?

17:44.167 --> 17:46.800
NO, WE DIDN'T.
GEORGIE DID.
DID HE SAY WHY?

17:46.833 --> 17:48.833
NOT REALLY, NO.

17:48.867 --> 17:50.833
DID GEORGIE AND DR. BURKE
MAYBE HAVE A FALLING OUT?

17:50.867 --> 17:54.400
NOT THAT I KNOW OF.
THEN IS THERE SOMETHING GOING ON
WITH GEORGE AND DR. HAHN?

17:54.433 --> 17:57.633
AH, HERE WE GO AGAIN.
NO, THERE'S NOTHING GOING ON
WITH GEORGE AND DR. HAHN.

17:57.667 --> 17:59.500
I ALREADY TOLD HER. DR. TORRES
IS THE ONE WHO LOVES GEORGE.

17:59.533 --> 18:02.267
WELL, THEN WHY DID DR. TORRES
BREAK UP WITH HIM?

18:02.300 --> 18:05.167
WHY DID DR. TORRES
BREAK UP WITH HIM,

18:05.200 --> 18:06.400
I MEAN, BETWEEN US?

18:06.433 --> 18:09.167
WELL... HOW MUCH
DID GEORGE TELL YOU?

18:09.200 --> 18:11.100
EVERYTHING,
I'M HIS MOTHER.
OKAY, WELL, THEN YOU KNOW

18:11.133 --> 18:12.767
THAT CALLIE IS
A LITTLE BIT OUT THERE.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.700
I MEAN, I HAVE SEEN
MORE OF THAT GIRL'S BODY

18:14.733 --> 18:15.800
THAN I HAVE OF MY OWN.

18:15.833 --> 18:18.233
IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH
INFORMATION FOR ME.

18:18.267 --> 18:21.533
I MEAN, NOBODY NEEDS TO BE
NAKED THAT OFTEN.

18:22.467 --> 18:25.100
HE DIDN'T TELL YOU THAT?

18:25.133 --> 18:27.067
UM... I DON'T KNOW
WHY THEY BROKE UP.

18:27.067 --> 18:28.800
GEORGE SEEMED
TO REALLY LIKE HER,

18:28.833 --> 18:30.067
AND HE KIND OF NEEDED HER.

18:30.067 --> 18:32.333
I MEAN, YOU REMEMBER THE WHOLE
GEORGE AND MEREDITH THING.

18:32.367 --> 18:33.833
WAIT, GEORGE AND MEREDITH?

18:33.867 --> 18:35.233
I KNEW IT.

18:35.267 --> 18:37.167
GEORGE DIDN'T
TELL YOU THAT EITHER.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.667
FIRST MEREDITH,
THEN DR. TORRES

18:38.700 --> 18:40.067
AND NOW THIS DR. HAHN...

18:40.100 --> 18:42.400
O'MALLEY MEN ARE STUDS.

18:42.433 --> 18:44.267
HE ISN'T A STUD,
HE'S JUST VERY HANDSOME.

18:44.300 --> 18:46.700
OKAY, PEOPLE, FOCUS. GEORGE
IS NOT DATING ERICA HAHN.

18:46.733 --> 18:49.067
THEN WHY WOULD HE WANT HER
TO PERFORM HIS FATHER'S SURGERY

18:49.067 --> 18:50.233
INSTEAD OF DR. BURKE?

18:50.267 --> 18:51.767
IS SHE BETTER
THAN DR. BURKE?

18:51.800 --> 18:53.833
SHE'S GOOD, REALLY GOOD.

18:53.867 --> 18:56.067
NOBODY'S BETTER THAN BURKE.

18:56.067 --> 18:58.500
THEN WHY CAN'T I HAVE
DR. BURKE?

18:58.533 --> 18:59.733
I DON'T KNOW.

18:59.767 --> 19:03.800
DO ME A FAVOR...
COULD YOU FIND OUT?

19:03.833 --> 19:06.367
HEY, HAVE YOU SEEN GEORGE?

19:06.400 --> 19:07.467
NO.

19:07.500 --> 19:10.167
HE IS ACTING SO WEIRD.
SO IS CRISTINA.

19:10.200 --> 19:13.067
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH EVERYONE TODAY?

19:13.067 --> 19:14.333
HEY, CALLIE. I WAS
GONNA COME AND FIND YOU.

19:14.367 --> 19:16.433
WHAT DID YOU WANT
TO TALK TO ME ABOUT?
PANTIES.

19:16.467 --> 19:19.700
UH, CALLIE, WHAT YOU UP TO?
I'M GONNA KICK
MEREDITH'S ASS RIGHT NOW.

19:19.733 --> 19:21.800
GET OFF ME!
I KEPT YOUR SECRETS,
I WAS DISCREET,

19:21.833 --> 19:23.733
I WAS A REALLY GOOD FRIEND
TO YOU, AND I DIDN'T HAVE TO BE,

19:23.767 --> 19:26.067
AND THEN YOU GO AND DO THIS?
DO WHAT?!

19:26.067 --> 19:28.700
HEY, CALLIE, USE YOUR WORDS!
USE YOUR WORDS, CALLIE.
PANTIES, MEREDITH.

19:28.733 --> 19:31.467
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT
THE McFREAKIN'-CONE-OF-SILENCE

19:31.500 --> 19:33.400
PAIR OF PANTIES I PULLED OFF
THE BULLETIN BOARD,

19:33.433 --> 19:36.133
NOT TO MENTION THE ADULTEROUS
McSEX I WITNESSED.
HEY, HEY, HEY!

19:36.167 --> 19:37.433
YOU REMEMBER THAT?
HEY, I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY,

19:37.467 --> 19:39.800
BUT SHE'S VERY LITTLE,
AND YOU'RE HURTING HER.
YOU TOLD GEORGE.

19:39.833 --> 19:42.067
MY NIGHT WITH McSTEAMY
WAS NOT YOURS TO SHARE.

19:42.100 --> 19:44.067
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT,
YOUR SEX WITH McSTEAMY?

19:44.067 --> 19:45.600
YOU TOLD IZZIE.

19:45.633 --> 19:47.467
NO. NO, NO!
CALLIE!

19:47.500 --> 19:49.800
YOU TOLD ME YOU SLEPT
WITH SOMEONE.

19:49.833 --> 19:54.067
YOU NEVER SAID IT WAS SLOAN.
GEORGE TOLD ME IT WAS SLOAN.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.433
GEORGE?

19:55.467 --> 19:57.500
GEORGE TOLD YOU?

19:57.533 --> 19:59.167
WHO TOLD GEORGE?

19:59.200 --> 20:01.633
MAYBE PERHAPS
THE GUY YOU SLEPT WITH?

20:04.233 --> 20:05.700
UM...

20:05.733 --> 20:08.167
GEORGE THINKS
I BETRAYED HIM,

20:08.200 --> 20:09.767
AND I DIDN'T.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.733
I DIDN'T.
WE WERE BROKEN UP.

20:11.767 --> 20:14.067
WELL, GO TELL GEORGE.

20:19.567 --> 20:21.467
DUDE, SHE WENT
ALL CAGE FIGHTER ON YOU.

20:21.500 --> 20:23.167
(laughs)
(laughs) I KNOW.

20:25.300 --> 20:26.467
HOW'S MY DAD DOING?

20:26.500 --> 20:29.133
GEORGE,
YOUR EX IS HARD-CORE--

20:29.167 --> 20:30.633
PASSIONATE, BUT HARD-CORE.

20:30.667 --> 20:32.667
YEAH, I DON'T--
HOW IS HE DOING?

20:32.700 --> 20:34.033
HE'S FINE, GEORGE.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.800
AND MY MOM,
IS SHE DRIVING YOU CRAZY?

20:35.833 --> 20:37.833
HAS SHE OFFERED
TO IRON YOUR SCRUBS?

20:37.867 --> 20:40.500
SHE DOES THAT.
SHE OFFERS TO IRON THINGS,

20:40.533 --> 20:42.500
WEIRD THINGS.

20:42.533 --> 20:45.333
THEY'RE FINE.
THEY'RE JUST, UM...

20:45.367 --> 20:46.300
WHAT?

20:46.333 --> 20:47.400
CONFUSED.

20:47.433 --> 20:49.100
YOU KNOW, SUDDENLY A STRANGER

20:49.133 --> 20:51.033
IS OPERATING
ON YOUR DAD'S HEART,

20:51.067 --> 20:52.800
AND THEY BOTH
WANT TO KNOW WHY,

20:52.833 --> 20:54.733
AND I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT TO TELL THEM, SO...

20:54.767 --> 20:55.933
CRISTINA, TELL IZZIE

20:55.967 --> 20:59.133
WHY DR. HAHN IS DOING MY DAD'S
SURGERY INSTEAD OF BURKE.

21:02.667 --> 21:04.500
GO ON.

21:04.533 --> 21:06.500
LOOK...

21:06.533 --> 21:08.433
DR. HAHN
IS AN INCREDIBLE SURGEON.

21:08.467 --> 21:10.433
YOUR FATHER IS IN GREAT HANDS.
NOTHING ELSE MATTERS.

21:10.467 --> 21:11.567
YOU'RE WRONG.

21:11.600 --> 21:14.300
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE
WITH FATHERS IN THIS HOSPITAL,

21:14.333 --> 21:17.267
AND IT DOES MATTER TO THEM
WHO THEIR DOCTOR IS.

21:22.067 --> 21:23.233
GEORGE, I...

21:23.267 --> 21:25.567
I-I KNOW THIS IS SCARY.
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

21:25.600 --> 21:27.433
BUT BURKE...

21:27.467 --> 21:29.533
I DIDN'T COME BACK
UNTIL I WAS READY.

21:29.567 --> 21:31.667
PRESTON BURKE IS READY.

21:31.700 --> 21:35.067
LOOK, I... I JUST CAN'T
TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS.

21:35.100 --> 21:37.467
THIS IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS,
AND JUST PLEASE,

21:37.500 --> 21:39.200
PLEASE STAY OUT OF THIS.

21:39.233 --> 21:41.133
WHAT DO I DO
ABOUT YOUR PARENTS?

21:41.167 --> 21:43.367
YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING
ABOUT MY PARENTS.

21:43.400 --> 21:46.200
YOUR JOB IS TO WATCH,
REMEMBER?

21:46.233 --> 21:48.767
I WAS JUST... SORRY.

21:53.400 --> 21:56.500
YOU MIGHT CONSIDER
LEAVING THAT ALONE

21:56.533 --> 21:58.200
UNTIL SHE GOES INTO
THE O.R.

21:58.233 --> 22:00.133
YEAH, ABOUT THAT--
WHEN'S THAT GONNA HAPPEN?

22:00.167 --> 22:02.233
THERE'S A LARGE SHARD OF GLASS
IN MY HEART, YOU KNOW?

22:02.267 --> 22:04.167
YOU'D BE SURPRISED
HOW LONG PEOPLE CAN LIVE

22:04.200 --> 22:05.333
WITH STUFF
INSIDE THEIR BODIES--

22:05.367 --> 22:07.067
GLASS, SHRAPNEL, BULLETS.

22:07.100 --> 22:09.800
I SAW A GUY ONCE WITH HALF
A CHAIR LEG IN HIS CHEST.

22:09.833 --> 22:12.700
THAT WAS ONE HELL
OF A SPLINTER.

22:12.733 --> 22:14.767
CAN WE FOCUS HERE?

22:14.800 --> 22:17.667
WELL... IT LOOKS LIKE
WE'LL, UH, HAVE THE O.R.

22:17.700 --> 22:19.367
IN A FEW HOURS.

22:19.400 --> 22:22.367
SO IF I GET HIT BY A CAR,
THROWN THROUGH A WINDOW,

22:22.400 --> 22:24.300
HAVE A BIG SHARD OF GLASS
IN MY CHEST

22:24.333 --> 22:25.500
AND MY BABY SURVIVES,

22:25.533 --> 22:28.333
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH A SIGN
I SHOULD HAVE THIS BABY, RIGHT,

22:28.367 --> 22:30.133
EVEN WITHOUT A FATHER?

22:30.167 --> 22:31.200
EVERYONE HAS A FATHER.

22:31.233 --> 22:33.733
NOT IF SHE DOESN'T TELL HIM.

22:33.767 --> 22:35.667
YOU THINK I SHOULD TELL HIM.

22:35.700 --> 22:37.433
EVERYONE SAYS I'M WRONG.

22:37.467 --> 22:39.367
HE'S SCUM,
AND NOW I'M THE BAD GUY

22:39.400 --> 22:41.300
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT HIM
IN MY KID'S LIFE, RIGHT?

22:41.333 --> 22:43.533
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE THINKING?
JANELLE...

22:43.567 --> 22:45.367
MY THING IS,
WHAT ABOUT THE KID?

22:45.400 --> 22:47.300
I MEAN, WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN HE'S 6 OR 7

22:47.333 --> 22:48.567
AND HE WANTS TO MEET HIS DAD?

22:48.600 --> 22:51.200
KAREV, THIS IS NONE OF
YOUR BUSINESS, OKAY?
SHE ASKED, OKAY?

22:51.233 --> 22:53.700
HE CHEATED ON ME.

22:53.733 --> 22:56.300
MAKES HIM AN ASS. DOESN'T
MEAN YOU HAVE TO BE ONE.

22:56.333 --> 22:59.100
(monitor beeping erratically)
MS. DUCO?

22:59.133 --> 23:01.833
B.P.'s 80 OVER 60.

23:01.867 --> 23:03.600
(beeping continues)

23:03.633 --> 23:05.367
J.V.D.
AND MUFFLED HEART SOUNDS.

23:05.400 --> 23:06.533
SHE'S OFFICIALLY UNSTABLE.

23:06.567 --> 23:08.467
THE O.R. CAN'T WAIT.
ALEX, FIND BURKE

23:08.500 --> 23:10.500
AND BOLUS A LITER OF SALINE,
HANG A UNIT OF BLOOD.

23:10.533 --> 23:13.267
WE'VE GOT TO GET HER READY
FOR TRANSPORT, PEOPLE, NOW!

23:13.300 --> 23:15.833
I'M SORRY. SPINAL WHAT?

23:15.867 --> 23:17.100
(Derek) STENOSIS.

23:17.133 --> 23:18.833
AND HE GOT THIS
IN THE ACCIDENT?

23:18.867 --> 23:20.567
I THINK IT MAY HAVE CAUSED
THE ACCIDENT.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.500
SPINAL STENOSIS IS COMMON
IN OLDER PEOPLE.

23:22.533 --> 23:24.433
NO, NO. LARRY DIDN'T HAVE
ANYTHING WRONG WITH HIM

23:24.467 --> 23:26.467
BEFORE THE ACCIDENT.

23:26.500 --> 23:28.567
SO THERE WERE NO SYMPTOMS
THAT EITHER OF YOU NOTICED?

23:28.600 --> 23:30.567
NO, LARRY WAS FINE.

23:30.600 --> 23:33.600
WE'RE OLD, BUT WE'VE BOTH
BEEN IN GOOD HEALTH.

23:33.633 --> 23:35.400
LARRY WAS FINE.

23:35.433 --> 23:37.433
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO OPERATE
ON YOUR HUSBAND.

23:37.467 --> 23:40.233
HE HAS A SUBDURAL HEMATOMA,
WHICH IS BLEEDING IN THE BRAIN.

23:40.267 --> 23:42.200
AND WE NEED TO BRING IN
A CARDIOTHORACIC SURGEON

23:42.233 --> 23:44.133
TO REPAIR THE HOLE
IN HIS TRACHEA,

23:44.167 --> 23:45.667
WHICH IS HIS WINDPIPE.

23:45.700 --> 23:47.600
THAT--THAT--SO THAT MEANS
THAT YOU NEED TO OPERATE

23:47.633 --> 23:49.400
ON HIS... CHEST
AND HIS HEAD?

23:49.433 --> 23:50.733
YES.

23:52.733 --> 23:55.667
WE JUST WANTED TO GO
TO THE MARKET.

24:18.833 --> 24:21.367
IT'LL BE OKAY,

24:21.400 --> 24:22.567
WHATEVER HAPPENS.

24:22.600 --> 24:25.100
CRISTINA--
HE CAN'T PUNISH YOU.

24:25.133 --> 24:27.067
EVERY SURGERY WE'VE DONE
HAS BEEN TEXTBOOK,

24:27.067 --> 24:28.800
AND WE HAVEN'T LOST
A SINGLE PATIENT.

24:28.833 --> 24:30.367
WE'RE FLAWLESS, AND HE CAN'T--
CRISTINA.

24:30.400 --> 24:32.067
YOU WERE RIGHT.

24:32.067 --> 24:34.767
THE CHIEF DOES WANT DR. HAHN
TO REPLACE ME

24:34.800 --> 24:38.733
AS HEAD
OF CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY.

24:38.767 --> 24:43.367
RICHARD'S PLANNING TO RETIRE.

24:43.400 --> 24:47.567
AND HE'S RECOMMENDING
THAT THE BOARD NAME ME...

24:47.600 --> 24:50.533
THE NEXT CHIEF OF SURGERY.

25:07.367 --> 25:09.067
THIS IS GOOD.
IT'S GOOD, RIGHT?

25:09.067 --> 25:10.533
IT MEANS GEORGE
DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

25:10.567 --> 25:11.733
I'M GOING TO BE CHIEF.

25:11.767 --> 25:14.200
AND YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM ANYTHING
ABOUT YOUR TREMOR, RIGHT?

25:14.233 --> 25:15.800
I'M GOING TO BE CHIEF...

25:15.833 --> 25:18.233
OF SURGERY
AT SEATTLE GRACE HOSPITAL.

25:18.267 --> 25:20.233
WHY DO YOU SOUND LIKE THAT?

25:20.267 --> 25:22.167
BECAUSE I'M GOING TO BE
CHIEF OF SURGERY

25:22.200 --> 25:24.400
AT SEATTLE GRACE HOSPITAL.

25:24.433 --> 25:26.333
THIS IS WHAT
YOU'VE WORKED FOR.

25:26.367 --> 25:28.433
THIS IS WHAT YOU WANTED.

25:28.467 --> 25:30.500
AND I CAN WORK HARDER. I--

25:30.533 --> 25:32.300
I CAN LEARN MORE PROCEDURES,

25:32.333 --> 25:34.233
I WILL DO WHATEVER
YOU NEED.
WHAT?

25:34.267 --> 25:36.233
RIGHT NOW NOBODY KNOWS.

25:36.267 --> 25:37.767
I-I MEAN, YES, OKAY,

25:37.800 --> 25:39.700
THE FACT THAT GEORGE
HASN'T TOLD THE CHIEF YET

25:39.733 --> 25:41.800
DOESN'T MEAN THAT HE WON'T,
BUT WE CAN DEAL WITH THAT.

25:41.833 --> 25:44.067
I MEAN, I'LL--I'LL TALK TO HIM,
OR YOU TALK TO HIM.

25:44.067 --> 25:45.800
AND ONCE YOU'RE CHIEF,
IT WON'T MATTER.

25:45.833 --> 25:48.333
I MEAN, YOU'LL BE CHIEF.
OKAY, THIS IS--THIS IS GOOD.

25:48.367 --> 25:50.767
NOBODY WILL EVER KNOW.
I'LL KNOW.

25:50.800 --> 25:53.433
I CAN'T BE CHIEF,
NOT NOW, NOT LIKE THIS.

25:53.467 --> 25:55.367
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG
I WANTED THIS?

25:55.400 --> 25:57.100
MY ENTIRE CAREER.

25:57.133 --> 25:59.367
AND WHEN I FINALLY GET IT...

25:59.400 --> 26:01.767
THERE'S BLOOD ON IT.

26:01.800 --> 26:04.767
I HAD A TREMOR, AND I DIDN'T
SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

26:04.800 --> 26:08.533
IT'S UNIMAGINABLE.
IT'S UNETHICAL... DISHONORABLE.

26:08.567 --> 26:09.767
I'VE CROSSED A LINE.

26:09.800 --> 26:13.833
WE CROSSED THE LINE TOGETHER.
I CROSSED THE LINE WITH YOU.

26:13.867 --> 26:15.600
YOU DRAGGED ME
ACROSS THE LINE.

26:15.633 --> 26:18.500
YOU MADE US A TEAM,
YOU TOLD SHEPHERD I WAS FINE,

26:18.533 --> 26:20.367
YOU SAID,
"NOBODY HAS TO KNOW."

26:20.400 --> 26:22.533
I WAS OUT THERE ON MY OWN.
YOU MADE US A TEAM.

26:22.567 --> 26:24.300
I DID
WHAT YOU NEEDED ME TO DO.

26:24.333 --> 26:26.133
YOU WERE STANDING THERE
LOOKING AT ME,

26:26.167 --> 26:28.067
TELLING ME YOUR WHOLE LIFE
WAS YOUR HANDS,

26:28.067 --> 26:31.267
IF YOU COULDN'T OPERATE, IF YOU
COULDN'T BE PRESTON BURKE--
THAT WAS YOUR CONCERN,
NOT MINE.

26:31.300 --> 26:34.067
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, YOU PUT THAT ON ME.

26:36.533 --> 26:38.600
WHEN YOU GOT SHOT,
I WALKED AWAY,

26:38.633 --> 26:42.333
AND YOU CANNOT
LET THAT GO, CAN YOU?

26:43.667 --> 26:46.300
WELL, I'M STICKING NOW.
OKAY? I'M STICKING.

26:46.333 --> 26:47.800
YOU KNOW HOW TIRED I AM?

26:47.833 --> 26:50.733
DO YOU KNOW HOW SCARED I AM
EVERY TIME WE GO INTO SURGERY?

26:50.767 --> 26:54.200
BUT I DO IT, FOR YOU.
DO YOU KNOW HOW SCARED I AM
WHEN WE GO INTO SURGERY?

26:54.233 --> 26:56.433
I DON'T HAVE TO JUST WORRY
ABOUT MY CAREER NOW.

26:56.467 --> 26:58.067
I HAVE TO PUT YOURS
ON MY BACK, TOO.

26:58.100 --> 26:59.567
WE ARE A TEAM.

26:59.600 --> 27:01.767
OH, THERE IS NO TEAM.
THERE IS NO TEAM.

27:01.800 --> 27:03.700
THERE IS ONLY ME, ONCE AGAIN,

27:03.733 --> 27:05.800
MAKING ALLOWANCES FOR
YOUR EMOTIONAL SHORTCOMINGS.

27:12.300 --> 27:14.533
OKAY,
WE SHOULDN'T SAY ANYMORE.

27:19.100 --> 27:21.567
NO...

27:24.100 --> 27:25.800
WE SHOULDN'T.

27:44.100 --> 27:45.833
(Mr. O'Malley)
OH, LOOK WHO'S HERE.

27:45.867 --> 27:47.767
OH, LOOK HOW WRINKLED
HE IS.

27:47.800 --> 27:49.700
THANK GOD I BROUGHT
THE TRAVEL IRON.

27:49.733 --> 27:51.400
MOM. MOM, WHAT'S GOING ON?

27:51.433 --> 27:53.333
THEY PAGED ME TO YOUR ROOM.
ARE YOU OKAY?

27:53.367 --> 27:56.300
FINE. IT'S JUST THAT...

27:56.333 --> 28:00.067
WHAT?
WANT ME TO?

28:00.100 --> 28:01.667
(Mr. O'Malley) NO, I'LL DO IT.

28:01.700 --> 28:03.833
HERE'S THE THING,

28:03.867 --> 28:06.100
WE APPRECIATE EVERYTHING
YOU'VE DONE FOR US.

28:06.133 --> 28:08.500
ALL THE STRINGS YOU PULLED
WITH DR. BURKE AND DR. HAHN--

28:08.533 --> 28:10.433
THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO
IS CAUSE TROUBLE

28:10.467 --> 28:12.567
'CAUSE WE HEARD HOW MUCH STRESS
YOU BEEN UNDER.

28:12.600 --> 28:15.700
FIRST WITH YOU AND MEREDITH,
THEN WITH YOU AND CALLIE--
IZZIE!

28:15.733 --> 28:17.700
I THOUGHT THEY KNEW.

28:17.733 --> 28:21.167
AND WE HOPE YOU WON'T BE MAD,
BUT WE RESCHEDULED THE SURGERY

28:21.200 --> 28:23.400
FOR TOMORROW BECAUSE--
WE'RE STICKING
WITH DR. BURKE.

28:25.300 --> 28:28.300
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO THEM?

28:28.333 --> 28:31.600
WE ASKED HER--
I ASKED YOU
TO STAY OUTTA THIS.

28:31.633 --> 28:34.367
I JUST TOLD THEM
WHAT I THOUGHT, THAT DOC--
GET OUT.

28:34.400 --> 28:36.533
W-WHAT?
GEORGIE...

28:36.567 --> 28:38.600
YOU DON'T TALK LIKE THAT
TO ANYONE.

28:38.633 --> 28:41.500
DAD... DID DR. STEVENS TELL YOU
THAT SHE'S ON PROBATION

28:41.533 --> 28:43.200
BECAUSE THE LAST TIME

28:43.233 --> 28:45.433
SHE WAS ALLOWED TO INTERACT
WITH PATIENTS, SOMEONE DIED?

28:54.833 --> 28:58.067
IT WAS REALLY NICE
TO SEE BOTH OF YOU.

29:01.867 --> 29:04.067
(kicks door)

29:08.133 --> 29:11.067
YOU KNOW THE GUY
WHO CAUSED THE ACCIDENT?

29:11.100 --> 29:12.267
AN O.R. JUST CLEARED UP.

29:12.300 --> 29:14.300
YOU AVAILABLE
TO SCRUB IN WITH ME?

29:17.633 --> 29:19.067
SHEPHERD...

29:19.100 --> 29:21.767
BURKE.

29:21.800 --> 29:23.467
WHAT'S GOING ON?

29:23.500 --> 29:27.200
(Alex) DR. BURKE, WE GOT
A PREGNANT WOMAN IN THE PIT

29:27.233 --> 29:28.433
WITH A TRAUMATIC
CARDIAC TAMPONADE

29:28.467 --> 29:30.367
FROM A PIECE OF GLASS
PIERCING HER HEART.

29:30.400 --> 29:33.267
ADDISON ASKED FOR YOU.
WELL, YOU CAN'T DO
TWO SURGERIES AT ONCE.

29:33.300 --> 29:36.200
NO, I CAN'T.

29:36.233 --> 29:38.133
(Alex) WELL,
SHE'S BLEEDING LIKE CRAZY.

29:38.167 --> 29:40.067
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

29:40.100 --> 29:44.700
(Derek) BURKE, MY GUY
CAN'T WAIT MUCH LONGER.

29:44.733 --> 29:46.067
WELL, DR. HAHN IS HERE.

29:46.067 --> 29:48.767
INVITE HER TO SCRUB IN
WITH YOU, DR. SHEPHERD.

29:48.800 --> 29:51.567
I'LL TAKE THE GLASS
PIERCING THE HEART.

29:51.600 --> 29:53.400
OKAY.

29:53.433 --> 29:55.633
UH, KAREV.

29:55.667 --> 29:57.300
YES, SIR.

29:57.333 --> 30:00.300
MAKE SURE THAT DR. YANG
SCRUBS IN WITH ME.

30:00.333 --> 30:03.233
EVERYBODY GETS A SURGERY
BUT ME.

30:22.100 --> 30:24.200
WE WERE BROKEN UP,
AS IN NOT TOGETHER.

30:24.233 --> 30:25.733
I CAN'T DO THIS NOW.

30:25.767 --> 30:27.667
I-I SLEPT WITH MARK
TO GET OVER YOU,

30:27.700 --> 30:29.600
AND GUESS WHAT,
IT DIDN'T WORK.

30:29.633 --> 30:32.533
IT WAS A MISTAKE, BUT I DID NOT
BETRAY YOU, GEORGE.

30:32.567 --> 30:37.067
I WOULDN'T--
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.
I CAN'T DO THIS NOW.

30:43.367 --> 30:46.367
OH, WHERE ARE YOU
TAKING HER?
SHE'S HAVING AN OPERATION.

30:46.400 --> 30:48.067
OH, NO.

30:48.100 --> 30:49.800
WHAT--WHAT--
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

30:49.833 --> 30:52.033
SHE HAS SOME BLEEDING
IN HER CHEST,

30:52.067 --> 30:53.267
AND THEY NEED TO OPERATE.

30:53.300 --> 30:56.033
I'M SORRY, JANELLE.

30:56.067 --> 30:57.767
I'M SO, SO SORRY.

30:57.800 --> 31:00.833
IT'S OKAY, MRS. D.

31:00.867 --> 31:04.433
I'M GONNA BE OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

31:04.467 --> 31:07.067
MRS. DICKERSON, YOU SHOULD
GO BACK TO YOUR HUSBAND'S ROOM

31:07.100 --> 31:08.433
AND WAIT THERE, OKAY?

31:08.467 --> 31:12.167
HE'S HAVING SURGERY, TOO.

31:12.200 --> 31:16.100
EVERYONE IS HAVING SURGERY.

31:17.300 --> 31:20.833
UH, GO ON AND TAKE HER UP.
THE SURGICAL TEAM IS WAITING.

31:20.867 --> 31:22.167
MA'AM.

31:22.200 --> 31:25.067
WHAT DID I DO?
HOW COULD I HAVE DONE THIS?

31:25.067 --> 31:27.233
DONE WHAT? DONE WHAT?

31:27.267 --> 31:31.333
I KNEW THAT HE HAD TROUBLE,
MY HUSBAND, WITH HIS FEET.

31:31.367 --> 31:33.367
MY DAUGHTER CAME TO TOWN,
SHE TOOK AWAY HIS KEYS.

31:33.400 --> 31:35.300
SHE TOOK AWAY HIS KEYS.

31:35.333 --> 31:39.133
YOU GAVE 'EM BACK TO HIM.

31:39.167 --> 31:41.567
IF I'D SIDED WITH MY DAUGHTER,

31:41.600 --> 31:43.733
OH, LARRY WOULD HAVE FELT
SO BETRAYED.

31:43.767 --> 31:45.800
HE LOVES TO DRIVE.

31:45.833 --> 31:47.733
HE--HE--HE DIDN'T MEAN
TO HURT ANYONE.

31:47.767 --> 31:52.233
OH, GOD. I DIDN'T MEAN
TO HURT ANYONE.

31:52.267 --> 31:54.400
I'M SO SORRY.

31:54.433 --> 31:55.600
UM...

31:55.633 --> 31:57.267
LISTEN, COME WITH ME.

31:57.300 --> 31:58.300
WHAT?

31:58.333 --> 32:01.200
I KNOW THAT YOU DIDN'T MEAN
TO HURT ANYONE...

32:01.233 --> 32:03.333
(sighs)

32:03.367 --> 32:05.833
BUT WE NEED TO TELL
THE POLICE.

32:05.867 --> 32:09.733
JUST TRUST ME, OKAY?

32:09.767 --> 32:11.433
YOU'RE GONNA TELL THE POLICE

32:11.467 --> 32:13.467
THE SAME THING
YOU JUST TOLD ME...

32:41.733 --> 32:43.633
IT ENTERED THE RIGHT VENTRICLE

32:43.667 --> 32:46.333
AND WENT RIGHT THROUGH
THE SEPTUM.

32:46.367 --> 32:48.500
I'M GOING TO NEED TO PLACE
A PERICARDIAL PATCH.

32:48.533 --> 32:50.433
SHALL I DO
A RUNNING WHIP STITCH?
NO, I'VE GOT IT.

32:50.467 --> 32:53.133
I CAN DO A McGOON.
I'VE BEEN PRACTICING.

32:53.167 --> 32:55.767
DR. YANG, MOVE TO
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE.

32:55.800 --> 32:57.700
DR. BURKE, I APOLOGIZE.
I--

32:57.733 --> 33:01.567
MOVE... TO THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE TABLE. THANK YOU.

33:16.067 --> 33:17.533
(Erica) CAN I GET SOME MORE
LAP PADS?

33:17.567 --> 33:20.067
(Derek) HOW'S IT GOING
DOWN THERE, DR. HAHN?
OH, JUST GROOVY.

33:20.100 --> 33:23.067
THEY'RE ALL GONNA BE SO JEALOUS
BACK AT SEATTLE PRESBYTERIAN.

33:23.100 --> 33:25.600
WHY IS THAT?
SCRUBBING IN
WITH DEREK SHEPHERD,

33:25.633 --> 33:27.533
THE GENIUS
WHO SAVED PRESTON BURKE

33:27.567 --> 33:29.467
WHEN HE ALMOST GOT HIS ARM
SHOT OFF?

33:29.500 --> 33:31.333
MAJOR JEALOUSY.
DID YOU HEAR THAT?
I'M A GENIUS.

33:31.367 --> 33:33.233
OF COURSE YOU ARE.

33:33.267 --> 33:35.100
NO, SHE WAS SERIOUS.
MM-HMM.

33:35.133 --> 33:37.400
DAMN IT. I'M SEEING
A PARTIAL TEAR IN HIS AORTA.

33:37.433 --> 33:40.133
YOU OKAY?
I'M GONNA HAVE TO ENLARGE
THE INCISION

33:40.167 --> 33:41.200
TO GET TO THE AORTA.

33:41.233 --> 33:43.200
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TURN HIM
ON HIS BACK AND REDRESS.

33:43.233 --> 33:45.100
(monitor beeping erratically)
HIS PRESSURE'S BOTTOMED OUT.

33:45.133 --> 33:47.700
CAN YOU GET CONTROL
DOWN THERE?
I KNOW, I KNOW,
HE'S CRASHING,

33:47.733 --> 33:49.800
AND THIS LACERATION'S
GETTING BIGGER BY THE SECOND.

33:49.833 --> 33:51.733
ALL RIGHT, YOU NEED HELP?
I NEED FOUR HANDS,

33:51.767 --> 33:53.667
AND I NEED EVERYONE IN HERE
TO HELP ME TURN HIM.

33:53.700 --> 33:55.467
PAGE THOMPSON.
HE'S OUT.

33:55.500 --> 33:57.267
IS BURKE AVAILABLE?
HE'S IN O.R. THREE.

33:57.300 --> 33:59.400
RUN IN THERE AND SEE IF
THEY CAN SPARE HIM A SECOND.

33:59.433 --> 34:01.833
OKAY, I NEED EVERYONE TO HELP ME
TURN HIM. ON YOUR COUNT DEREK.

34:01.867 --> 34:04.067
WE'VE GOT ABOUT HALF AN HOUR
BEFORE THIS PATIENT DIES...
(Derek) MOVE IT.
TAKE IT OFF. LET'S GO.

34:04.067 --> 34:06.167
THAT IS IT.

34:06.200 --> 34:07.733
START REWARMING.

34:07.767 --> 34:09.433
PLEDGETED 5-0 PROLENE.

34:09.467 --> 34:11.367
IT'S GONNA TAKE ABOUT
TEN MINUTES

34:11.400 --> 34:14.267
BEFORE THE BODY WARMS UP,
THEN WE'LL TAKE HER OFF BYPASS.

34:14.300 --> 34:15.733
NICE WORK, DR. BURKE.

34:15.767 --> 34:18.333
THANK YOU.

34:22.867 --> 34:25.333
DR. BURKE, DR. HAHN
WAS REPAIRING THE TRACHEA

34:25.367 --> 34:27.067
AND FOUND
AN AORTIC TRANSECTION.

34:27.100 --> 34:30.733
PATIENT'S CRASHING.
SHE REALLY NEEDS YOUR HELP.

34:32.733 --> 34:34.767
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

34:34.800 --> 34:37.533
THE HEART CAN'T COME OFF
OF BYPASS FOR A WHILE YET.

34:37.567 --> 34:39.767
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
UM, SHALL I COME?

34:39.800 --> 34:42.067
NO, STAY HERE.

34:44.333 --> 34:45.233
MER. MER.

34:45.267 --> 34:47.467
IS IT BAD?
WHAT DOES SHE NEED HIM TO DO?

34:47.500 --> 34:49.833
THE GUY'S CHEST IS A MESS.

34:49.867 --> 34:51.767
SHE'S JUGGLING THE TRACHEAL
AND THE AORTIC INJURIES,

34:51.800 --> 34:53.800
AND SHE JUST NEEDS
ANOTHER PAIR OF HANDS.

34:53.833 --> 34:57.633
HE JUST REPAIRED
A HOLE IN HER HEART.
I'M SURE HE CAN HANDLE IT.

34:57.667 --> 34:59.367
(Meredith) CRISTINA.

34:59.400 --> 35:02.300
(Preston) HEY, HEY, HEY.
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

35:02.333 --> 35:03.667
GET BACK IN THERE.

35:05.367 --> 35:09.600
WHAT, DO YOU THINK BURKE
CAN'T OPERATE WITHOUT YOU?

35:13.867 --> 35:16.667
OH, MY GOD, CRISTINA.

35:16.700 --> 35:18.067
SHUT UP.

35:18.067 --> 35:20.733
HE CAN'T OPERATE
WITHOUT YOU.

35:20.767 --> 35:23.633
IF YOU EVER GAVE A CRAP
ABOUT ME IN ANY WAY,

35:23.667 --> 35:26.667
YOU WILL SHUT YOUR MOUTH
AND GET BACK INTO THAT O.R.

35:51.500 --> 35:53.600
THERE'S A BEAT.
IT'S BEATING.

35:53.633 --> 35:56.433
SHE'S READY
TO COME OFF BYPASS, RIGHT?
SHE IS.

35:56.467 --> 35:58.367
DR. BURKE ASKED ME
TO TELL YOU

35:58.400 --> 36:00.233
HE'S GONNA BE LONGER
THAN HE THOUGHT.

36:00.267 --> 36:02.600
"LONGER THAN HE THOUGHT"?
WHAT ELSE DID HE SAY?

36:02.633 --> 36:06.533
SHE COULD STROKE OUT
IF SHE STAYS ON ANY LONGER.

36:06.567 --> 36:08.367
IS--WHAT DID HE SAY?

36:08.400 --> 36:11.533
HE SAID YOU SHOULDN'T WORRY.
HE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

36:11.567 --> 36:16.200
WELL, LET'S UNCLAMP
AND SEE WHAT WE'VE GOT.

36:19.067 --> 36:21.133
BRAIN'S NOT INTERESTING
ENOUGH FOR YOU, DR. GREY?

36:21.167 --> 36:23.200
(Erica) I'VE STILL GOT
A LOT OF BLEEDING.

36:23.233 --> 36:25.133
I'LL PLACE
A PARTIAL OCCLUDING CLAMP.

36:25.167 --> 36:27.067
4-0 PROLENE.

36:32.433 --> 36:33.467
THERE.

36:33.500 --> 36:35.300
EXCELLENT, BURKE.
THANK YOU.

36:35.333 --> 36:39.233
IT SHOULD HOLD ONCE YOU GET
A FEW MORE IN THERE.

36:39.267 --> 36:41.433
(whispers)
FOCUS, DR. GREY.

36:41.467 --> 36:43.067
FOCUS.

36:43.067 --> 36:44.400
(Preston clears throat)

36:45.800 --> 36:48.067
EVERYTHING OKAY,
DR. BURKE?

36:48.067 --> 36:51.067
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

36:51.067 --> 36:52.633
DR. GREY?

36:56.667 --> 36:59.733
IT'S BEEN TOO LONG.
SHE NEEDS TO COME OFF BYPASS.

36:59.767 --> 37:01.300
SHE SHOULD COME OFF SOON,
DR. YANG.

37:01.333 --> 37:03.233
HOW DO YOU WANT TO PROCEED?

37:03.267 --> 37:05.233
I'M NOT HAVING THIS GIRL
DIE OF A STROKE AFTER ALL THIS.

37:05.267 --> 37:09.133
PAGE SOMEONE, ANYONE WHO CAN
HELP TAKE HER OFF BYPASS.

37:12.067 --> 37:14.633
WHAT HAPPENED IN THERE?
HE'S GOING TO LIVE.

37:14.667 --> 37:16.833
DR. BURKE,
YOU WERE GONE TOO LONG.

37:16.867 --> 37:19.533
SHE COULD STROKE OUT
ANY SECOND FROM--
GATHER YOURSELF, DR. YANG.

37:19.567 --> 37:21.467
LET'S TAKE HER OFF BYPASS.

37:22.667 --> 37:25.233
GOOD. GOOD RHYTHM.

37:25.267 --> 37:28.300
TEMPERATURE IS UP.
OKAY, LET'S TAKE HER OFF BYPASS.

37:28.333 --> 37:30.333
COMING OFF BYPASS.

37:30.367 --> 37:33.067
START PROTAMINE.

37:33.067 --> 37:35.100
GIVE HER MORE VOLUME.

37:35.133 --> 37:37.567
ARTERIAL LINE IS OUT.

37:37.600 --> 37:40.667
(monitor beeping)

37:40.700 --> 37:44.100
NICE. KEEP GOING.

37:44.133 --> 37:46.500
COME ON.

37:46.533 --> 37:48.267
THERE IT IS.

37:48.300 --> 37:50.367
HEARTBEAT'S STILL STRONG.
NICELY DONE, DR. BURKE.

37:50.400 --> 37:52.300
UH, SO WE JUST
CHECK EVERYTHING AND CLOSE.

37:52.333 --> 37:53.833
WE'LL CLOSE--

37:53.867 --> 37:55.133
WAIT.

37:58.167 --> 38:01.667
UGH! SHE BLEW A STITCH. SHE
COULD HAVE A TEAR IN HER HEART.

38:01.700 --> 38:02.900
GIVE ME
THE PLEDGETED 4-0 PROLENE.

38:02.933 --> 38:04.833
PUT UP TWO FRESH UNITS
OF BLOOD.
WHAT CAN I DO? BURKE?

38:04.867 --> 38:06.833
HOLD PRESSURE. I NEED
TO REPAIR THE HEART WALL.

38:06.867 --> 38:10.500
(monitor beeping erratically)

38:10.533 --> 38:12.400
SHOULD I PUT ON A CLAMP?
ONE MOMENT.

38:12.433 --> 38:15.633
WE DON'T HAVE A MOMENT.
HOLD ON!

38:15.667 --> 38:17.533
I NEED TO PUT
THE CANNULAS BACK IN

38:17.567 --> 38:19.333
SO WE CAN EMPTY OUT
THE HEART AGAIN.

38:19.367 --> 38:21.333
SHE NEEDS TO GO
BACK ON BYPASS.

38:21.367 --> 38:24.100
REHEPARINIZE
AND GIVE ME THE TUBES.

38:24.133 --> 38:26.100
(beeping continues)

38:26.133 --> 38:29.067
HER ATRIUM
IS EXTREMELY FRIABLE.

38:29.067 --> 38:32.567
***

38:34.533 --> 38:36.267
IT CAN'T HOLD A STITCH.

38:36.300 --> 38:38.200
WHAT ABOUT A HORIZONTAL
MATTRESS? I CAN DO IT.

38:38.233 --> 38:42.067
DR. YANG,
I DON'T NEED YOU FOR THIS.

38:42.100 --> 38:45.233
***

38:45.267 --> 38:48.133
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

38:48.167 --> 38:51.067
THIS IS A KNOWN COMPLICATION
OF THE SURGERY.

38:51.100 --> 38:52.600
IT HAPPENS.

38:52.633 --> 38:54.533
***

38:54.567 --> 38:55.833
IT HAPPENS.

38:55.867 --> 38:57.467
(sighs)

38:57.500 --> 39:00.267
***

39:00.300 --> 39:01.400
RESTART BYPASS.

39:01.433 --> 39:03.467
(woman) RESTARTING BYPASS.

39:03.500 --> 39:07.833
I WAS PAGED.
CAN I HELP?

39:07.867 --> 39:10.633
***

39:10.667 --> 39:13.067
I'M REPAIRING THE HEART WALL.

39:13.067 --> 39:15.567
I COULD USE YOUR HELP
FOR A SECOND ATTEMPT

39:15.600 --> 39:16.833
TO COME OFF BYPASS.

39:16.867 --> 39:19.467
I'LL SCRUB IN.

39:19.500 --> 39:22.767
***

39:28.167 --> 39:31.133
LOAD MORE 4-0 PROLENE

39:31.167 --> 39:33.833
AND A NEW PERICARDIAL PATCH.

39:33.867 --> 39:37.267
***

39:44.467 --> 39:47.467
***

40:00.767 --> 40:03.767
***

40:05.567 --> 40:07.067
(knock on door)

40:07.100 --> 40:08.433
(Richard) COME IN.

40:08.467 --> 40:12.333
***

40:12.367 --> 40:15.167
CHIEF, WE NEED TO TALK.

40:15.200 --> 40:19.833
YES, DR. BURKE,
I THINK WE DO.

40:19.867 --> 40:23.033
***

40:37.867 --> 40:41.033
(mouthing words)

40:55.600 --> 40:57.467
YOU'RE LUCKY, YOU KNOW?

40:57.500 --> 40:59.133
PARDON?

40:59.167 --> 41:00.433
TO STUDY UNDER BURKE.

41:00.467 --> 41:01.833
IF YOUR LITTLE INTERN BRAIN

41:01.867 --> 41:03.767
CAN RETAIN ANY
OF WHAT HE TEACHES YOU,

41:03.800 --> 41:06.133
MAYBE YOU'LL BECOME
HALF THE SURGEON HE IS,

41:06.167 --> 41:08.600
AND THAT'S PRETTY DAMN GOOD.

41:08.633 --> 41:11.600
IF YOU TELL HIM
I TOLD YOU THIS...

41:11.633 --> 41:13.633
AH, HE'LL NEVER BELIEVE YOU.

41:22.133 --> 41:23.133
KAREV.

41:23.167 --> 41:25.200
DR. MONTGOMERY,
HOW'S SHE DOING?

41:25.233 --> 41:27.133
SHE MADE IT THROUGH
THE SURGERY.

41:27.167 --> 41:29.067
SO DID THE BABY,
WHICH IS, UH...

41:29.100 --> 41:31.533
WELL, IT'S LIKE I SAID,
THE KID'S A FIGHTER.

41:31.567 --> 41:33.600
YOU THINK SHE'LL CALL
THE GUY, THE DAD?

41:33.633 --> 41:35.667
NO. IT TAKES MORE THAN
A, UH, WELL-MEANING SPEECH

41:35.700 --> 41:37.800
TO GET A GIRL TO MAKE
A COMMITMENT LIKE THAT.

41:37.833 --> 41:39.500
YEAH.

41:39.533 --> 41:41.433
I APPRECIATED IT, THOUGH,
YOUR TAKE.

41:41.467 --> 41:43.200
UH, IT WAS SURPRISING.

41:43.233 --> 41:44.233
"SURPRISING"?

41:44.267 --> 41:46.167
WELL, FOR A MARK SLOAN
PROTéGé.

41:46.200 --> 41:49.067
LACKEY.
I DABBED BLOOD ALL DAY.

41:49.100 --> 41:51.200
YOU'RE A DECENT GUY,
ALEX.

41:51.233 --> 41:55.233
I'D HATE TO SEE
SLOAN BEAT THAT OUT OF YOU.

42:00.800 --> 42:03.400
ANYWAY...
YEAH, THANKS.

42:03.433 --> 42:05.333
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
OKAY.

42:05.367 --> 42:08.300
(clears throat)

42:15.167 --> 42:17.167
(elevator bell dings)

42:31.300 --> 42:33.433
I WOULD'VE HELPED YOU
IF YOU'D TOLD ME.

42:39.733 --> 42:41.567
BURKE?

42:41.600 --> 42:43.167
I CANNOT.

42:43.200 --> 42:48.767
IT'S... BEEN A LONG DAY...

42:48.800 --> 42:50.633
AND I JUST CANNOT.

42:53.167 --> 42:55.233
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
MY FRIEND.

42:55.267 --> 42:57.400
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE MY SURGEON.

43:00.767 --> 43:05.533
(Cristina) IN SOME WAYS,
BETRAYAL IS INEVITABLE.

43:05.567 --> 43:07.700
WHEN OUR BODIES BETRAY US,

43:07.733 --> 43:13.467
SURGERY IS OFTEN
THE KEY TO RECOVERY.

43:13.500 --> 43:17.133
WHEN WE BETRAY EACH OTHER...

43:17.167 --> 43:19.500
WHEN WE BETRAY EACH OTHER,

43:19.533 --> 43:23.367
THE PATH TO RECOVERY
IS LESS CLEAR.

43:56.167 --> 43:59.667
IT WAS BOTH OUR IDEA
TO ROB THE BANK.

43:59.700 --> 44:01.400
IT WAS BOTH OF US.

44:01.433 --> 44:02.567
I KNOW.

44:02.600 --> 44:05.067
I JUST--OH, I COULDN'T
DO IT ANYMORE.

44:05.100 --> 44:06.300
IT WASN'T--

44:06.333 --> 44:07.800
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.

44:07.833 --> 44:09.267
YEAH?

44:11.867 --> 44:14.733
THEN HOW COME I WALKED
ACROSS THE PARKING LOT

44:14.767 --> 44:18.167
AND REALIZED
I CAN'T GO HOME?

44:20.533 --> 44:22.833
BUT WHERE AM I
SUPPOSED TO GO?

44:22.867 --> 44:26.600
***

44:36.433 --> 44:39.067
***

44:39.067 --> 44:40.133
HEY.

44:40.167 --> 44:41.567
HEY.

44:43.200 --> 44:44.633
SO DR. HAHN...

44:44.667 --> 44:46.667
YEAH.

44:46.700 --> 44:49.600
***

44:49.633 --> 44:52.167
HE'S MY DAD...

44:52.200 --> 44:55.267
AND I'M SCARED, AND YOU...

44:55.300 --> 44:57.267
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE
KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE

44:57.300 --> 44:59.200
TO HAVE SOMEONE YOU LOVE
IN THE HOSPITAL--

44:59.233 --> 45:03.200
NO. YOU DO NOT GET TO BRING UP
DENNY TO ME EVER AGAIN.

45:03.233 --> 45:05.233
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

45:05.267 --> 45:06.767
I'M SORRY.

45:06.800 --> 45:09.667
***

45:09.700 --> 45:12.633
DON'T TRY TO APOLOGIZE,
NOT NOW, NOT YET.

45:14.567 --> 45:17.333
OKAY.

45:17.367 --> 45:20.400
***

45:22.367 --> 45:24.833
MAYBE TOMORROW.

45:24.867 --> 45:27.167
OKAY.

45:30.500 --> 45:33.433
***

45:33.467 --> 45:36.400
YOU WATCHED HIS HANDS
ALL THROUGH SURGERY.

45:36.433 --> 45:39.600
YOU KNEW.

45:39.633 --> 45:42.233
I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING.

45:42.267 --> 45:44.167
THERE ARE THINGS
CRISTINA TOLD ME.

45:44.200 --> 45:47.667
SHE'S MY FRIEND.
I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING.

45:47.700 --> 45:52.633
NO. NO, THAT IS NOT
HOW THIS WORKS.

45:52.667 --> 45:55.100
HOW COULD YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU KNOW

45:55.133 --> 45:58.367
OR SUSPECT IT
AND NOT EVEN TELL ME?

45:58.400 --> 46:01.600
YOU CLEARED HIM
FOR SURGERY, DEREK.

46:01.633 --> 46:04.300
HOW DID YOU NOT KNOW?

46:04.333 --> 46:06.600
YOU CAN'T BE ANGRY WITH ME.

46:06.633 --> 46:08.133
SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND,

46:08.167 --> 46:11.167
AND RIGHT OR WRONG, SHE...

46:11.200 --> 46:12.333
(sighs)

46:12.367 --> 46:15.067
WHAT?

46:16.767 --> 46:19.567
SHE WAS THERE
WHEN YOU WEREN'T.

46:19.600 --> 46:22.600
***

46:24.600 --> 46:27.067
(sighs)

46:29.133 --> 46:31.100
WE DO WHATEVER IT TAKES

46:31.133 --> 46:35.067
TO REBUILD THE TRUST
THAT WAS LOST.

46:35.100 --> 46:38.100
***

46:57.567 --> 46:59.767
AND THEN THERE
ARE SOME WOUNDS,

46:59.800 --> 47:01.700
SOME BETRAYALS
THAT ARE SO DEEP,

47:01.733 --> 47:04.567
SO PROFOUND...

47:04.600 --> 47:08.500
THAT THERE'S NO WAY
TO REPAIR WHAT WAS LOST.

47:08.533 --> 47:11.533
***

47:13.333 --> 47:17.333
AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS...

47:17.367 --> 47:20.367
***

47:27.633 --> 47:30.733
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO DO
BUT WAIT.
