WEBVTT

00:02.550 --> 00:05.589
Packed your favorite... strawberries.

00:05.590 --> 00:08.341
Mom, strawberries aren't
my favorite fruit anymore.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.879
Since when?

00:09.880 --> 00:12.380
Since I had the pleasure
of tasting a tangelo.

00:12.388 --> 00:15.079
Now my top five fruits are, in order,

00:15.080 --> 00:17.659
tangelos, guava, tomatoes...

00:17.660 --> 00:19.129
they're a fruit, Google it...

00:19.130 --> 00:21.230
kiwi, and pluots.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.439
Got to love Westport.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.239
The closest I got to
fresh fruit as a kid

00:25.240 --> 00:27.110
was wild cherry cough drops.

00:32.439 --> 00:33.560
Oh, no!

00:33.570 --> 00:34.979
Principal Ablin's gonna ask me

00:34.980 --> 00:37.620
to chaperone another one of
Anna-Kat's class field trips!

00:37.621 --> 00:41.290
Katie, I need to speak to you

00:41.300 --> 00:46.129
about the field trip tomorrow.

00:46.130 --> 00:47.930
I got to come up with an excuse.

00:47.940 --> 00:49.399
What have I used in the past?

00:49.400 --> 00:51.459
I've done root canal.
I've done malaria twice.

00:51.460 --> 00:53.419
I had my hip replaced
at a very young age.

00:53.420 --> 00:54.680
Wait.

00:54.690 --> 00:56.359
I actually have a legitimate excuse

00:56.360 --> 00:57.599
for not going on the field trip!

00:57.600 --> 00:59.309
Katie, I was wondering if you w...

00:59.310 --> 01:00.839
I can't chaperone the field trip!

01:00.840 --> 01:02.100
I have a job!

01:02.110 --> 01:04.063
Ha! In your face!

01:04.063 --> 01:05.272
Why is it in my face?

01:05.274 --> 01:07.949
I don't know. You figure it
out. You're the educator.

01:19.872 --> 01:20.913
Long day at work?

01:20.914 --> 01:22.999
Long month at work.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.929
I have been working overtime

01:24.930 --> 01:27.545
planning the Founder's Day Fair.

01:27.546 --> 01:29.639
- What's that?
- It is the fair in three weeks

01:29.640 --> 01:31.620
that celebrates the founding
fathers of Westport.

01:32.340 --> 01:35.619
All I know is, I ordered a
gluten-free funnel cake today,

01:35.620 --> 01:37.009
and part of me died.

01:37.010 --> 01:39.319
I could really use a
big-time pony play session

01:39.320 --> 01:40.350
with you right now.

01:40.351 --> 01:41.934
Okay. Choose your filly.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.729
Where's Sir Sparkles?

01:44.730 --> 01:46.750
He died last month saving Sassy Sadie

01:46.760 --> 01:48.419
from drowning in the toilet.

01:48.420 --> 01:50.193
I begged him to learn how to swim.

01:50.194 --> 01:53.089
I don't recognize most of these ponies.

01:53.090 --> 01:55.320
I've gotten a lot of new ones lately.

01:55.330 --> 01:58.300
Here's my favorite... Major Cuddles!

01:58.310 --> 01:59.999
Major isn't just his rank,

02:00.000 --> 02:02.299
but also how I describe his hugs,

02:02.300 --> 02:03.999
because even though he's military,

02:04.000 --> 02:05.792
he's not emotionally distant.

02:05.793 --> 02:08.068
Anna-Kat, I'm sorry

02:08.070 --> 02:10.079
that I've been working
nights and weekends

02:10.080 --> 02:12.109
and haven't been able to
play with you as much.

02:12.110 --> 02:14.279
It's okay, Mom. I know you're busy.

02:14.280 --> 02:16.049
I actually don't expect
you to be around,

02:16.050 --> 02:17.470
so I just assume you won't be.

02:17.471 --> 02:21.379
And the new number-one thing a
mother never wants to hear is...

02:21.380 --> 02:23.289
what Anna-Kat just said.

02:23.290 --> 02:25.319
Till Oliver says, "We're
putting you in a home.

02:25.320 --> 02:26.437
No cable."

02:28.460 --> 02:30.959
Did you know Sir Sparkles died?

02:30.960 --> 02:32.402
Oh, yeah. That was a rough one.

02:32.403 --> 02:33.569
He didn't have a will.

02:33.570 --> 02:35.299
His colts are still
fighting over his estate.

02:35.300 --> 02:37.969
I used to know everything
going on with her.

02:37.970 --> 02:39.409
I feel so disconnected.

02:39.410 --> 02:40.785
Don't be so hard on yourself.

02:40.786 --> 02:42.339
I bet you know all the pony names.

02:42.340 --> 02:43.700
Of course I do. I'm a good parent.

02:44.623 --> 02:46.582
... married to another good parent.

02:46.583 --> 02:47.792
Mm-hmm.

02:47.793 --> 02:49.549
So, here we are...

02:49.550 --> 02:50.629
two good parents.

02:51.720 --> 02:54.380
I'm just having a hard time with
the work/life balance thing.

02:54.383 --> 02:55.990
Look, we're lucky I can
adjust my schedule

02:56.000 --> 02:57.759
and work out of the house
more and be with the kids.

02:57.760 --> 02:58.979
When one of us is busy,

02:58.980 --> 03:00.596
the other can pick up
the slack. We're a team.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.959
I know, but I still feel bad.

03:02.960 --> 03:04.319
Anna-Kat is getting older,

03:04.320 --> 03:06.599
and I don't want our
relationship to become

03:06.600 --> 03:08.059
like my relationship with Taylor.

03:08.060 --> 03:09.599
What's wrong with that?

03:09.600 --> 03:10.869
Taylor, how you doing, honey?

03:10.870 --> 03:12.740
Get off my back, man!

03:14.020 --> 03:15.809
Well, if you want to spend
more time with Anna-Kat,

03:15.810 --> 03:17.947
maybe you should chaperone the
field trip instead of me.

03:17.948 --> 03:18.948
You're chaperoning?

03:18.949 --> 03:20.283
Yeah, Ablin called and asked me to go.

03:20.284 --> 03:23.849
Well, look at you...

03:23.850 --> 03:26.619
knowing pony names,
chaperoning field trips.

03:26.620 --> 03:28.819
Part of the problem is,
you're too nice of a dad.

03:28.820 --> 03:30.042
You need to be worse.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.127
When it comes to parenting,

03:31.128 --> 03:33.004
I don't go up to you...
you come down to me.

03:33.005 --> 03:34.464
Why do I always have
to come down to you?

03:34.465 --> 03:35.929
I don't do self-improvement.

03:35.930 --> 03:37.490
You knew that when you married me, bro.

03:42.740 --> 03:45.057
I don't feel well.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.894
Yeah, right! Go get dressed.

03:46.895 --> 03:48.260
I'm being serious!

03:48.270 --> 03:49.490
I've been throwing up all night.

03:49.500 --> 03:50.810
Why don't you ever believe me?

03:50.814 --> 03:52.523
- 'Cause you always fake being sick.
- Mm-hmm.

03:52.524 --> 03:53.983
You're thinking of Mom and malaria.

03:53.984 --> 03:55.229
I do do that.

03:55.230 --> 03:57.300
I swear... I'm really sick.

03:57.920 --> 03:59.160
Trip is going to Thunder Park

03:59.170 --> 04:00.698
for senior ditch day, and I want to go.

04:00.699 --> 04:01.783
So fake being sick.

04:01.784 --> 04:03.819
I fake being sick way too many times.

04:03.820 --> 04:05.453
Unless I barf up some arthritis...

04:05.454 --> 04:07.399
- That's not a thing.
- ... then Mom and Dad won't buy it.

04:07.400 --> 04:08.414
I need your help.

04:10.800 --> 04:12.999
They might not buy you being sick,

04:13.000 --> 04:14.599
but they will if we both are sick.

04:14.600 --> 04:15.879
Wait... you're sick?

04:15.880 --> 04:17.539
That's great! Then you can get me sick!

04:17.540 --> 04:18.639
Quick... sneeze in my mouth.

04:18.640 --> 04:21.379
No! I'll also fake being sick.

04:21.380 --> 04:22.389
Oh.

04:22.390 --> 04:24.509
They'll never think we're both lying.

04:24.510 --> 04:25.659
But if I do this for you,

04:25.660 --> 04:27.892
you guys need to take me and
Cooper to Thunder Park.

04:27.893 --> 04:29.249
Fine.

04:29.250 --> 04:30.269
What's the plan?

04:32.650 --> 04:34.190
I've been throwing up all night.

04:34.191 --> 04:35.733
Oh, no. Taylor, too.

04:35.734 --> 04:36.859
Geez, if they're both sick,

04:36.860 --> 04:38.770
then maybe Taylor is
not lying after all.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.019
Maybe they have food poisoning.

04:41.020 --> 04:42.719
Just follow my lead.

04:42.720 --> 04:43.741
Hey, Mom?

04:43.742 --> 04:45.519
Can I have this yogurt smoothie

04:45.520 --> 04:46.530
I found in the fridge?

04:46.537 --> 04:47.539
Sure.

04:47.540 --> 04:49.413
Great. It looks delicious.

04:49.414 --> 04:51.159
Hey, Taylor, you want to share

04:51.160 --> 04:53.009
this yogurt smoothie I
found in the fridge?

04:53.010 --> 04:54.168
It looks delicious.

04:54.169 --> 04:56.213
Sure. It looks delicious.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.959
Oh, no! It's expired.

04:59.960 --> 05:01.419
Oh, who cares?

05:01.420 --> 05:03.539
Mom always said it's
okay to eat expired food

05:03.540 --> 05:05.010
if it's in the two-week buffer zone.

05:05.640 --> 05:07.720
Oh, well. Bottoms up.

05:08.150 --> 05:10.893
You guys are total idiots for
drinking that expired smoothie.

05:10.894 --> 05:12.228
But it was in the buffer zone!

05:12.229 --> 05:13.688
- Did you smell it?
- No.

05:13.689 --> 05:15.529
Everyone knows you got to smell it

05:15.530 --> 05:16.959
if it's in the buffer zone.

05:16.960 --> 05:18.700
That is buffer zone 101.

05:18.710 --> 05:20.403
Back to bed. No school
for you two today.

05:20.404 --> 05:22.220
I'm sorry I can't stay
and take care of them.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.529
I have to go on Anna-Kat's field trip.

05:23.530 --> 05:24.560
Oh, don't worry, Dad.

05:24.570 --> 05:26.019
Oliver and I can take
care of each other.

05:26.020 --> 05:27.029
That's sweet.

05:27.030 --> 05:29.078
Stop being the nice parent.
You're making me look bad.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.454
You could try being the nice parent.

05:30.455 --> 05:31.809
We can't change it up now, Greg.

05:31.810 --> 05:34.009
- We are in this way too deep.
- Hmm.

05:35.480 --> 05:38.749
I need some advice on
what to do with Anna-Kat.

05:38.750 --> 05:40.280
I don't have time to do the fun stuff

05:40.290 --> 05:42.519
that we usually do
together because of work.

05:42.520 --> 05:44.385
Oh. I can totally relate to that.

05:44.386 --> 05:46.229
- Really?
- That's not possible.

05:46.230 --> 05:47.930
Recently, I started spending

05:47.940 --> 05:49.099
more time at home with the kids,

05:49.100 --> 05:50.799
but then I felt like I was missing out

05:50.800 --> 05:52.436
on all this fun stuff
at the country club.

05:52.437 --> 05:54.200
I felt bad for neglecting the club,

05:54.210 --> 05:56.240
so I started spending less time at home.

05:57.316 --> 05:58.566
Hmm.

05:58.567 --> 06:00.590
Katie, if you want to spend
time with your kids,

06:00.600 --> 06:02.409
then sometimes that means
doing things with them

06:02.410 --> 06:04.196
that you don't want to
do... like chaperoning.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.879
But I already did that last year.

06:05.880 --> 06:08.951
Yeah, well, it's kind of like
the mammogram of parenting.

06:08.952 --> 06:11.879
Ugh. Just another way they
put the squeeze on us!

06:11.880 --> 06:13.719
I don't want to chaperone again.

06:13.720 --> 06:15.060
It was just a lot of me saying,

06:15.070 --> 06:16.759
"Don't wander off! Stay together!

06:16.760 --> 06:17.769
Don't climb on that!"

06:17.770 --> 06:19.059
"Don't tell your mom I hit you."

06:19.060 --> 06:21.159
But I did have fun with Anna-Kat.

06:21.160 --> 06:23.749
We sang songs on the bus,
and we made up this game

06:23.750 --> 06:25.149
where we pretended not to know anything

06:25.150 --> 06:26.969
because it was our first day on Earth.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.769
- Example, please.
- Mm.

06:28.770 --> 06:31.339
"What is this mysterious
brown substance?"

06:31.340 --> 06:32.760
Yeah, I don't care anymore.

06:32.770 --> 06:34.539
Katie, there's no
reason why you can't go

06:34.540 --> 06:36.605
on that field trip today and
reconnect with Anna-Kat.

06:36.606 --> 06:38.139
You're right.

06:38.140 --> 06:39.690
- I'm gonna do it.
- Great.

06:39.691 --> 06:40.776
When do they leave?

06:40.777 --> 06:42.359
10 minutes.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.380
- Damn! I got to go.
- Oh.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.360
You didn't really hit a kid
on a field trip, did you?

06:47.366 --> 06:48.519
Oh.

06:48.520 --> 06:49.640
Your son didn't tell you?

06:49.680 --> 06:52.929
Damn, you're a good mom!
You didn't raise a narc!

06:58.660 --> 06:59.729
All right, kids.

06:59.730 --> 07:02.169
Everyone take your seats. We're leaving.

07:04.000 --> 07:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:17.521 --> 07:19.959
Good morning, room 5!

07:19.960 --> 07:22.020
My name is Katie Otto, Anna-Kat's mom,

07:22.025 --> 07:24.289
and I am here to chaperone
your field trip

07:24.290 --> 07:25.859
to Caldwell Farms.

07:25.860 --> 07:26.869
Katie, what are you doing here?

07:26.870 --> 07:28.199
I think my announcement one second ago

07:28.200 --> 07:29.400
was pretty clear about that.

07:29.408 --> 07:31.459
Yeah, but I took the day
off from work to...

07:38.760 --> 07:40.719
What are you doing here?
I thought you had a job.

07:40.720 --> 07:41.909
I do have a job.

07:41.910 --> 07:43.590
And I took a day off from that job

07:43.600 --> 07:44.909
to do an even more important job...

07:44.910 --> 07:46.674
to connect with my daughter.

07:46.675 --> 07:48.549
In your face.

07:48.550 --> 07:51.410
I will not have that in my face again.

07:52.514 --> 07:54.989
All right, let's get
this field trip started

07:54.990 --> 07:57.119
with a little bus song.

07:57.120 --> 07:58.679
♪ Hey, Mickey, you're so fine ♪

07:58.680 --> 08:00.029
♪ You're so fine, you blow my mind ♪

08:03.300 --> 08:04.692
What are you doing?

08:04.693 --> 08:07.069
What is a bus ride without a sing-along?

08:07.070 --> 08:08.329
Come on, everybody!

08:08.330 --> 08:09.339

08:13.540 --> 08:14.840
Hey, Mickey!

08:14.860 --> 08:17.830
Dude! What are you doing?

08:17.831 --> 08:20.549
Mom always said to dance like
no one's watching and...

08:20.550 --> 08:22.044
to sleep like nobody's watching.

08:23.211 --> 08:24.219
I had trouble sleeping.

08:24.220 --> 08:25.919
I thought people were watching me.

08:25.920 --> 08:28.679
Sorry. Ablin ruined everything.

08:28.680 --> 08:30.119
Yeah.

08:30.120 --> 08:31.759
Mother always said that, too.

08:35.265 --> 08:36.890
The smoothie plan worked perfectly.

08:36.892 --> 08:38.799
Sometimes I think about
using my powers for good,

08:38.799 --> 08:40.899
and then I do stuff like
this and I think...

08:40.900 --> 08:42.129
Nah.

08:42.130 --> 08:44.739
So, you drank expired yogurt
and it didn't make you sick?

08:44.740 --> 08:45.770
How'd you pull that off?

08:45.776 --> 08:47.276
It wasn't really expired.

08:47.277 --> 08:48.487
So how'd you get sick?

08:48.488 --> 08:49.500
We faked it.

08:52.866 --> 08:55.743
You don't need to understand
the plan for it to work.

08:55.744 --> 08:56.749
Oh, thank God.

08:56.750 --> 08:58.496
Cooper, how'd you get
out of school today?

08:58.497 --> 09:01.089
Oh, I don't really have to
worry about stuff like that.

09:01.090 --> 09:04.589
_

09:05.900 --> 09:06.921
You get a boat!

09:06.922 --> 09:08.256
And you get a boat!

09:08.270 --> 09:09.999
And you get a boat!

09:14.971 --> 09:16.430
Oh, no. Dad's home.

09:16.431 --> 09:18.057
He's supposed to be on
Anna-Kat's field trip!

09:18.058 --> 09:20.142
- Guys, go hide.
- Why? Then I won't get to see your dad.

09:20.143 --> 09:21.150
That's the point.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.609
You don't need to understand
the plan for it to work.

09:25.610 --> 09:27.340
Let's vámanos, compadre.

09:27.818 --> 09:30.319
Come on. We got to make
ourselves look sick again.

09:39.955 --> 09:42.439
Hey, guys. I'm not going on
Anna-Kat's field trip anymore,

09:42.440 --> 09:43.959
so I came home to see how you're doing.

09:43.960 --> 09:45.629
I still feel sick.

09:45.630 --> 09:48.170
I feel like Taylor reads... terrible.

09:48.171 --> 09:49.959
Oh, no. Sounds like
you're getting worse.

09:49.960 --> 09:51.500
I better stay here and
take care of you guys.

09:51.508 --> 09:54.209
Y-You shouldn't stay home
just because we're sick.

09:54.210 --> 09:56.579
Why not grab some quality Greg time?

09:56.580 --> 09:58.179
Yeah, go catch a movie.

09:58.180 --> 10:00.379
There's two Ruth Bader
Ginsburg films out.

10:00.380 --> 10:02.609
She's your celebrity hall
pass, for God's sake.

10:02.610 --> 10:04.279
I'm happy to take care of you two.

10:04.280 --> 10:06.559
I'm gonna make you some of my
mother's famous chicken soup.

10:06.560 --> 10:08.060
Do you know what the
secret ingredient is?

10:08.066 --> 10:09.442
- Is it love?
- Love?

10:10.040 --> 10:12.319
No. It's...

10:12.320 --> 10:14.320
I don't want to tell you anymore.

10:16.741 --> 10:18.599
Ugh. Now instead of ditch day,

10:18.600 --> 10:20.999
we have to stay home and
pretend to be sick.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.470
Yeah, I know. I was here, too.

10:26.740 --> 10:29.039
Don't wander off. Stay together.

10:29.040 --> 10:30.679
Don't climb on that!

10:32.007 --> 10:34.609
Caldwell Farms is a fully functional

10:34.610 --> 10:36.635
fruit and animal farm.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.721
But not an "Animal Farm"

10:38.722 --> 10:41.949
like George Orwell's allegorical novella

10:41.950 --> 10:45.853
that criticized the rhetoric
of the Russian Revolution.

10:47.990 --> 10:50.232
Always funny. Always.

10:50.233 --> 10:52.499
I'm also proud to point out

10:52.500 --> 10:55.799
Caldwell Farms' newest edition...

10:55.800 --> 10:58.539
this gorgeous gazebo

10:58.540 --> 11:01.599
built by none other than
your Principal Ablin.

11:02.610 --> 11:03.679
Wow!

11:03.680 --> 11:05.497
Why would you build them a gazebo?

11:05.498 --> 11:06.679
Because I love it here,

11:06.680 --> 11:08.579
and I hope to be buried
under it someday.

11:08.580 --> 11:10.252
So in your face.

11:10.253 --> 11:12.119
Well, my face is a shield,

11:12.120 --> 11:14.249
so it bounces off and hits
your face twice as hard!

11:14.250 --> 11:15.382
Double face!

11:15.383 --> 11:16.759
Double face?

11:16.760 --> 11:18.459
That's the worst of all faces.

11:18.460 --> 11:21.759
Uh, now, before we move
on to the petting zoo,

11:21.760 --> 11:23.474
does anyone have any questions?

11:23.475 --> 11:25.530
Yes.

11:26.600 --> 11:29.189
What are those things behind you?

11:30.070 --> 11:32.100
Uh...

11:32.110 --> 11:33.525
You mean the apples?

11:33.526 --> 11:35.569
Ooh! Apples!

11:35.570 --> 11:37.639
Very interesting.

11:37.640 --> 11:39.199
What do they do?

11:39.960 --> 11:42.009
They just...

11:42.010 --> 11:43.279
They're apples!

11:43.280 --> 11:45.319
Mom, no. Don't play First Day on Earth.

11:45.320 --> 11:46.740
Let's just go to the petting zoo.

11:46.748 --> 11:48.019
One second.

11:48.020 --> 11:50.650
Gerald, so, these apples,

11:50.660 --> 11:53.003
where are their parents?

11:53.004 --> 11:55.629
Well, I suppose...

11:55.630 --> 11:57.859
in a way, that's me.

11:57.860 --> 12:00.136
Mom, please stop!

12:00.880 --> 12:03.389
Does your mom really not
know what apples are?

12:03.390 --> 12:04.959
She's just playing this dumb game

12:04.960 --> 12:06.399
that she thinks is funny

12:06.400 --> 12:10.146
but is definitely not funny.

12:13.108 --> 12:15.401
Anna-Kat, what is wrong?!

12:15.402 --> 12:16.479
Katie?

12:16.480 --> 12:18.510
See, you eat it.

12:19.990 --> 12:22.449
I know what a damn apple is, Ablin.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.109
You are gonna be buried
under that gazebo

12:24.110 --> 12:25.160
sooner than you think.

12:27.290 --> 12:28.330
Excuse me.

12:29.791 --> 12:32.219
I just got off the phone
with an old college friend

12:32.220 --> 12:34.429
who works in infectious
diseases at the Mayo Clinic.

12:34.430 --> 12:35.859
He said that food poisoning

12:35.860 --> 12:37.506
from dairy products is very serious.

12:37.507 --> 12:38.769
I think it's out of our systems.

12:38.770 --> 12:39.839
It's not.

12:39.840 --> 12:41.009
But it will be.

12:41.010 --> 12:42.699
My friend gave very
specific instructions

12:42.700 --> 12:44.596
on how to flush the
toxins from your bodies.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.473
We're gonna sweat it out.

12:51.020 --> 12:52.856
How long do we have to
stay in here like this?

12:52.857 --> 12:54.679
- Just an hour.
- An hour?!

12:54.680 --> 12:57.401
No way! I look like I've
been Chaka Khanned!

12:57.402 --> 12:58.610
You know who Chaka Khan is?

12:58.611 --> 13:00.889
Oh. That's a person?

13:00.890 --> 13:02.531
I thought it meant being electrocuted.

13:02.532 --> 13:04.890
Stay here. I'll be back to
check on you in an hour.

13:06.930 --> 13:08.299
This sucks!

13:08.300 --> 13:10.159
I hate being sick!

13:10.160 --> 13:11.180
You're not really sick.

13:11.200 --> 13:12.790
Oh, yeah.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.005
- Hey. How's the trip going?
- Terrible.

13:18.006 --> 13:20.909
I need the nice parent's
perspective on the situation.

13:20.910 --> 13:23.439
I have been trying to have
fun with Anna-Kat all day,

13:23.440 --> 13:24.849
but she keeps shutting me down.

13:24.850 --> 13:26.689
I've been doing our greatest hits...

13:26.690 --> 13:28.849
sang songs, First Day on Earth.

13:28.850 --> 13:31.310
Maybe you're trying too
hard. Just be yourself.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.520
If I were myself, I wouldn't
be on this field trip.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.229
It's Anna-Kat. You
know what she likes...

13:35.230 --> 13:37.159
true crime fiction, the
wrath of Mother Nature,

13:37.160 --> 13:39.652
YouTube videos of sleeping
bears falling out of trees.

13:40.630 --> 13:42.460
And ponies.

13:42.470 --> 13:44.899
Maybe I'm not trying too hard,

13:44.900 --> 13:47.659
but, actually, I'm not
trying hard enough.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.244
So the opposite of what I just said?

13:49.245 --> 13:50.919
I use you as a sounding board, Greg.

13:50.920 --> 13:52.680
I don't come to you for answers.

13:53.340 --> 13:55.409
I'll give you a Jolly Rancher

13:55.410 --> 13:57.550
if you help me bond with my kid.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.630
You're mine now.

14:04.720 --> 14:06.059
Now, step two.

14:06.060 --> 14:08.055
You need to put this all
over your faces and bodies.

14:08.056 --> 14:09.629
- What is that?
- It's a homemade salve

14:09.630 --> 14:11.266
of mustard, turmeric, and garlic.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.759
Now that the toxins are out,

14:12.760 --> 14:14.853
you need to put this in
your pores immediately.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.981
That's not necessary, Dad.
We're feeling much better.

14:16.982 --> 14:19.219
Do you guys know what
alkaline-hepatitis-12 is?

14:19.220 --> 14:20.619
- No.
- Well, you can get it

14:20.620 --> 14:21.629
if you don't do this.

14:29.702 --> 14:32.037
When you're done putting it
on, get back in the bathroom.

14:33.250 --> 14:35.082
Okay, now you have to let the heat

14:35.083 --> 14:36.439
melt it into your pores.

14:36.440 --> 14:37.584
I'll be back in an hour.

14:42.966 --> 14:44.258
We're missing a lot of fun.

14:44.259 --> 14:45.635
Pictures can be deceiving.

14:45.636 --> 14:46.859
There's a video.

14:46.860 --> 14:48.679
This is the best time of my life!

14:48.680 --> 14:50.339
It's just one person.

14:50.340 --> 14:52.569
We're all having the
best time of our lives!

14:57.105 --> 14:59.439
Hey, Anna-Kat, look who I just found!

14:59.440 --> 15:01.609
It is Major Cuddles!

15:01.610 --> 15:04.269
And he has come to life!

15:04.270 --> 15:05.460
Mom, no.

15:05.470 --> 15:07.649
Playing with toy ponies is one thing,

15:07.650 --> 15:10.659
but playing with real-life ponies

15:10.660 --> 15:12.077
is even better.

15:12.078 --> 15:14.190
You still play with toy ponies?

15:14.860 --> 15:16.089
No.

15:16.090 --> 15:17.833
Ponies are for babies.

15:17.834 --> 15:19.585
Ohh! Mrs. Otto.

15:19.586 --> 15:22.329
Please put Beverly back!

15:22.330 --> 15:23.769
She spooks easily

15:23.770 --> 15:26.133
a-and needs the structure of her corral.

15:26.134 --> 15:27.539
I don't know who Beverly is.

15:27.540 --> 15:28.960
This is Major Cuddles.

15:29.620 --> 15:32.890
Do you and your friends
want to pet Major Cuddles?

15:35.510 --> 15:37.603
Can you stop? Please.

15:37.604 --> 15:38.849
Come on, Anna-Kat.

15:38.850 --> 15:40.772
I took the day off to hang out with you.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.232
Can we talk about this later?

15:42.233 --> 15:43.525
Why can't we talk about it now?

15:43.526 --> 15:45.360
Because you're ruining the field trip.

15:45.361 --> 15:47.329
I am not ruining the field trip.

15:47.330 --> 15:48.822
Am I, Major Cuddles?

15:54.871 --> 15:56.205
My gazebo!

15:56.206 --> 15:57.539
Beverly!

15:58.670 --> 16:01.711
Okay. Now I'm ruining the field trip.

16:02.700 --> 16:05.439
Beverly! Come back here, girl!

16:05.440 --> 16:07.299
Beverly, please come home!

16:07.300 --> 16:10.039
Maybe all of this
yelling is scaring her.

16:10.040 --> 16:11.500
We should ease up for a sec.

16:11.510 --> 16:13.879
That's good advice for you, too.

16:13.880 --> 16:16.579
Hey! That is not fair.

16:16.580 --> 16:19.039
You know, the only reason that
I came on this field trip

16:19.040 --> 16:21.689
was because I felt bad
about working a lot lately

16:21.690 --> 16:23.440
and not spending enough time with you.

16:23.441 --> 16:25.567
You're just trying to
force having fun with me.

16:25.568 --> 16:27.159
It is not forced.

16:27.160 --> 16:29.629
I am just trying to connect
by doing things you like.

16:29.630 --> 16:32.469
First Day on Earth, singing "Mickey"...

16:32.470 --> 16:34.179
I don't like those things anymore.

16:34.180 --> 16:35.990
Well, what about ponies?

16:35.995 --> 16:38.330
You were just playing with
your ponies yesterday at home.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.039
Yeah... at home.

16:40.040 --> 16:43.679
I don't need my friends knowing
I still play with ponies.

16:43.680 --> 16:46.047
Can't you see how that can
be embarrassing for me?

16:48.620 --> 16:49.967
Yeah.

16:49.968 --> 16:52.719
Mom, I've changed. I like
different stuff now.

16:52.720 --> 16:53.790
I have new friends,

16:53.800 --> 16:55.720
and I just want to be
like everyone else.

16:58.790 --> 17:01.399
It's almost time to go.

17:01.400 --> 17:03.199
I'm gonna go get on the bus.

17:11.609 --> 17:13.309
Well, we found Beverly.

17:13.310 --> 17:14.608
She's back in her corral,

17:14.609 --> 17:16.367
sleeping under four weighted blankets.

17:16.368 --> 17:20.749
Man. I blinked for a second,
and she changed on me.

17:20.750 --> 17:23.079
No matter how many times it happens,

17:23.079 --> 17:24.960
I'm never ready for it.

17:24.961 --> 17:26.618
I know what you mean.

17:26.619 --> 17:29.259
I wasn't ready to lose my gazebo, but...

17:29.260 --> 17:30.299
here I am.

17:33.390 --> 17:35.529
I'll get you for this, Katie Otto.

17:38.099 --> 17:40.726
Okay, that's enough of that.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.686
Get me in the shower immediately!

17:42.687 --> 17:44.646
Hang on. There's one last
thing you need to do.

17:44.647 --> 17:45.779
Put these in your ears.

17:45.780 --> 17:47.190
You have to be joking.

17:47.191 --> 17:48.450
I know, but in most of the world,

17:48.460 --> 17:50.620
onions are used to treat
all sorts of illnesses.

17:50.630 --> 17:52.990
This is quick... five minutes,
and then you're totally done.

17:53.580 --> 17:55.241
What do the scallions do?

17:55.242 --> 17:57.920
They make you look more ridiculous.

17:57.930 --> 17:58.950
What are you doing?

17:58.953 --> 18:00.519
After your mother threw
me off the school bus,

18:00.520 --> 18:01.759
I came home to check on you guys.

18:01.760 --> 18:03.299
I quickly found Trip and Cooper,

18:03.300 --> 18:05.751
who are for sure the worst
hiders in the world.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.859
When I asked them what
they were doing there,

18:19.860 --> 18:23.519
Cooper started giving me what
was clearly an elaborate lie.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.279
I made it clear unless
he told me the truth,

18:25.280 --> 18:27.106
I'd tell your mother everything.

18:27.720 --> 18:30.120
He immediately spilled his guts.

18:31.820 --> 18:33.403
When I asked Trip to confirm the story,

18:33.404 --> 18:36.459
he said he couldn't because he
didn't know what was going on.

18:36.460 --> 18:38.992
If you guys ever lie to me again,

18:38.993 --> 18:40.919
I will post this picture everywhere

18:40.920 --> 18:42.519
so all your friends see it.

18:42.520 --> 18:44.623
I'll post it at the school
library, at Izzo's Hardware...

18:44.624 --> 18:46.619
It would just be easier to
post it on the Internet.

18:46.620 --> 18:47.870
Why are you helping him?

18:48.600 --> 18:50.340
That was really messed up, Dad.

18:50.350 --> 18:51.838
I thought you were the nice parent.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.790
I am nice, but you took advantage of me,

18:53.800 --> 18:56.079
so the lesson is, never
piss off the nice parent,

18:56.080 --> 18:58.470
because if you do, you get
punished 10 times harder.

18:58.471 --> 18:59.519
You'll also be happy to know

18:59.520 --> 19:00.810
the stuff you rubbed all over yourself

19:00.820 --> 19:02.680
turned out to be a darn
good salad dressing.

19:02.684 --> 19:04.602
Yeah, that really turns my day around.

Thanks for throwing me a bone.

19:50.982 --> 19:52.169
No problem.

19:52.170 --> 19:54.469
And if you want to chaperone
another field trip,

19:54.470 --> 19:55.999
- if you behave...
- Mm-hmm.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.028
... I'd be okay with that.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.509
That is so sweet.

19:59.510 --> 20:02.367
But I've been banned
from all field trips.

20:02.368 --> 20:03.952
Was that the point of the whole day?

20:03.953 --> 20:07.957
No. Just an awesome bonus.

20:10.020 --> 20:11.770

20:16.980 --> 20:18.599
They totally fell for it.

20:20.710 --> 20:22.137
You're a real hard-ass today.

20:22.138 --> 20:23.221
I know. It was really fun.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.149
What is going on around here?

20:25.150 --> 20:26.249
You're mean.

20:26.250 --> 20:28.979
Anna-Kat has become a
normal kid with friends.

20:28.980 --> 20:30.479
Wait, let me check something.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.619
Taylor, how you doing, honey?

20:32.620 --> 20:34.899
Good! Doing homework! Love you so much!

20:34.900 --> 20:37.789
I have no idea what's going on anymore.

20:42.260 --> 20:44.229
That's weird. There's nobody here.

20:44.230 --> 20:46.160
Hmm.

20:47.740 --> 20:49.649
In your face!
