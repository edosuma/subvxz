00:13.146 --> 00:14.670
This is your captain speaking.

00:14.814 --> 00:17.806
Flight time to Nice will be
seven hours, 30 minutes.

00:17.984 --> 00:19.645
Our flight attendants will be coming by

00:19.819 --> 00:21.753
to provide you
with complimentary beverages.

00:21.921 --> 00:22.853
Excuse me!

00:22.989 --> 00:26.425
- We'll be flying at an altitude of 31,000 feet.
- Hello!

00:26.593 --> 00:28.823
- Relax and enjoy your flight.
- Excuse me.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.527
- Hey, there!
- Mom.

00:32.365 --> 00:35.061
- Do you mind?
- Emergency exit's 13D, sweetie.

00:35.468 --> 00:37.197
Great. Got it. Thanks, Dad.

00:38.838 --> 00:39.770
Excuse me.

00:40.940 --> 00:42.100
Three chardonnays, please.

00:42.242 --> 00:44.972
No, nothing for me.
I always remain alert in flight.

00:45.111 --> 00:47.204
- Me, neither. Thank you.
- Just the three, then.

00:48.982 --> 00:50.916
I am so proud of you, sweetie.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.679
A lot of women who had just got dumped
would have backed out of this vacation,

00:53.853 --> 00:55.184
but not you.

00:55.321 --> 00:57.551
Thanks, Dad, but I didn't get dumped.
It wasn't quite like that.

00:57.690 --> 00:59.157
- It was mutual.
- Yes.

00:59.325 --> 01:01.122
They agreed to part ways,
when he dumped her.

01:01.661 --> 01:03.288
I thought it was because he needed space.

01:03.430 --> 01:05.660
No, he just didn't find her
spontaneous enough.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.423
Too safe. Predictable.

01:07.734 --> 01:10.259
I am sitting right here. I can hear you.

01:10.403 --> 01:12.837
He tried to get you to go bungee jumping.
You wouldn't do it.

01:12.972 --> 01:15.805
I have a thing about heights,
and a rule about vomiting in public.

01:15.942 --> 01:18.467
- I think that's perfectly reasonable.
- Too many rules, dear.

01:18.945 --> 01:20.879
There's nothing wrong
with being cautious, sweetie.

01:21.014 --> 01:22.641
Safety is sexy.

01:23.183 --> 01:24.377
First time your mother and I made love,

01:24.551 --> 01:26.985
we managed to keep our seatbelts on
the entire time.

01:27.153 --> 01:28.643
- Wasn't easy...
- Okay, Dad,

01:29.456 --> 01:30.923
what did I just say
about vomiting in public?

01:32.959 --> 01:34.017
Change seats.

01:34.561 --> 01:38.895
- And the emergency exit is...
- 13D. Trust me. I know where it is.

01:39.032 --> 01:40.897
About to throw myself out of it.

02:55.909 --> 02:57.706
I got a visual on him now.

02:58.745 --> 03:00.940
Target confirmed. I know the drill.

04:09.816 --> 04:12.307
You have until 5:00 p.m.
To deliver the package,

04:12.518 --> 04:14.418
then the boss wants you to
close the account.

04:14.621 --> 04:17.055
Yeah, yeah. I will have
his final bill ready to go.

04:17.724 --> 04:21.716
You have my wife and I on the second floor
and my daughter on the third,

04:21.894 --> 04:23.862
when I specifically booked adjacent rooms.

04:23.997 --> 04:25.430
I assure you, your room is lovely...

04:25.565 --> 04:28.125
"Lovely" and "adjacent"
are not the same thing.

04:28.301 --> 04:30.394
She's a single woman, all alone.

04:31.971 --> 04:34.371
Recently single. I am not always alone.

04:35.341 --> 04:36.399
Dad, the room is fine. Can you drop it?

04:36.542 --> 04:39.636
Do you know how many push-in robberies
happen in hotels, sweetie?

04:40.446 --> 04:42.744
Third floor. We'd like an ocean view.

04:43.049 --> 04:46.348
- Always the same thing with the rooms.
- Let Daddy do his thing.

04:46.953 --> 04:47.942
Little Frenchman will cave.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.748
He's a weasel face, like you-know-who.

04:51.524 --> 04:54.084
- Richard. I'm talking about Richard.
- I know, Mother.

04:54.260 --> 04:55.955
We're not discussing him
anymore, remember?

04:56.229 --> 04:59.289
- Right, right. He's dead to us.
- Yes.

04:59.866 --> 05:01.925
So it never bothered you that he had
a kind of womanly butt?

05:02.168 --> 05:03.100
What?

05:04.404 --> 05:05.701
No, he did not.

05:06.506 --> 05:07.438
Forget I said anything.

05:08.474 --> 05:11.705
- I do not speak French.
- Excuse me. We have resolved the problem.

05:11.944 --> 05:14.412
I'm going to go check on my room.
You and Daddy figure this out.

05:14.547 --> 05:15.775
You want a little Maalox for the road?

05:17.383 --> 05:19.112
Wouldn't it be easier just to humor me?

07:01.821 --> 07:02.981
I don't speak French.

07:04.891 --> 07:06.859
Yeah, no, no. I got it the first time.

07:07.727 --> 07:11.686
- Why were you pretending back there?
- I don't know. Why did you follow me?

07:12.432 --> 07:14.229
I was already going to the beach.
Remember?

07:15.001 --> 07:17.094
Yeah, well, I could be going swimming, too.

07:17.403 --> 07:18.335
Are you?

07:19.338 --> 07:20.270
No.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.605
- I'm just going to go marinate in shame.
- I'm Spencer, by the way.

07:25.978 --> 07:28.071
It's nice to meet you, Spencer.

07:29.949 --> 07:33.009
- Do you have a name?
- Jen! Jennifer. Sometimes Jenny.

07:33.186 --> 07:36.280
No, it's Jen. It's just Jen.

07:36.889 --> 07:39.323
I'm gonna go swimming before it gets dark.

07:40.159 --> 07:43.026
Yes, of course.
Muscles like that take some upkeep.

07:53.940 --> 07:55.339
Do you want to get a drink with me tonight?

07:55.875 --> 07:58.742
Yeah. Yeah, sure. I don't have anything
better to do, so why not?

08:00.046 --> 08:03.675
Great. I'll see you at Stella Maris at sunset.

08:05.117 --> 08:06.414
Unless you have something better to do.

08:18.764 --> 08:19.731
Okay.

08:23.870 --> 08:25.895
No. No cute dress.

08:26.606 --> 08:28.699
I didn't pack a single cute dress?

08:28.908 --> 08:31.399
Oh, my God. I think I have all my socks.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.437
Got to find a dress.

08:44.123 --> 08:45.055
Thank you.

08:59.572 --> 09:02.905
We knocked on your door several times,
I can't believe you're missing this.

09:03.075 --> 09:07.569
I know, Dad. I'm sorry. It's just...
You know, my stomach, it's going crazy.

09:12.418 --> 09:14.852
Look, we'll come back right away
with saltines and ginger ale.

09:15.054 --> 09:16.544
No, stay put. I'm fine.

09:16.989 --> 09:18.320
Don't be a hero, sweetie.

09:18.524 --> 09:20.788
Dad, trust me,
you don't want to be a part of this.

09:21.093 --> 09:22.151
Wait...

09:22.695 --> 09:24.890
Darling, at least you'll look thin
on the beach.

09:29.535 --> 09:31.162
- You sure you're gonna be all right?
- Yes.

09:31.337 --> 09:33.703
You and Mom go. Have fun without me.

09:37.209 --> 09:41.509
You're gonna find the perfect guy.
Someone who is good and decent and kind.

09:41.647 --> 09:43.808
And doesn't have
a dishonest bone in his body.

10:01.667 --> 10:02.599
Oh, God!

10:03.102 --> 10:04.228
You picked a perfect table.

10:07.106 --> 10:08.038
Please.

10:08.407 --> 10:10.136
I had to atone for being late.

10:10.743 --> 10:11.801
Too bad I hate champagne.

10:12.645 --> 10:14.840
- I'm sorry. Please. Just go.
- I was joking. It was a joke.

10:16.515 --> 10:17.948
That was a joke.

10:18.517 --> 10:22.112
I am a dating robot
sent here to observe your ways.

10:26.926 --> 10:28.689
You just pulled a robot voice.

10:29.829 --> 10:31.160
I don't know.

10:32.732 --> 10:33.664
All right, don't worry.

10:33.799 --> 10:36.927
There's a certain segment of the population
that goes over big for that sort of thing.

10:37.069 --> 10:39.037
Yeah, nerds. They're my bread and butter.

10:39.171 --> 10:41.196
Yeah? How's that working out for you?

10:43.876 --> 10:45.036
Oh, God. Shit!

10:48.914 --> 10:50.541
This isn't at all what I wanted.

10:50.683 --> 10:52.150
- How about you?
- I don't know.

10:52.385 --> 10:54.319
What do we... Are you all right?

10:57.256 --> 11:00.384
- All I wanted was a baked potato.
- Okay.

11:01.761 --> 11:02.693
Hi.

11:04.063 --> 11:05.087
Are you on the lam?

11:06.432 --> 11:11.165
You see that guy over by the menus?
Freakishly tall, excellent mustache.

11:15.741 --> 11:17.003
- Okay.
- No.

11:18.077 --> 11:19.442
I do need to sit down somewhere.

11:22.415 --> 11:24.042
That is a gorgeous mustache.

11:24.750 --> 11:25.842
Well, he...

11:27.486 --> 11:28.953
He's a Russian diplomat.

11:29.755 --> 11:31.120
Also kind of a pervert.

11:32.158 --> 11:34.422
Sat next to him on the plane.
Got a little grabby.

11:34.560 --> 11:39.020
Really? Wait, wait, wait.
Women don't like grabby?

11:39.165 --> 11:40.826
That's...
I'm gonna have to change my whole MO.

11:43.602 --> 11:46.571
I also heard him in the hotel
trying to get the room next to mine.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.004
- It's just kind of weird.
- Well, I hope you switched rooms.

11:49.141 --> 11:52.804
Oh, no, no. No, I like to live on the edge.

11:52.945 --> 11:54.913
Dangerous weirdoes, spicy food.

11:55.948 --> 11:56.972
Bungee jumping.

11:57.216 --> 12:00.276
I'll give you dangerous weirdoes
and spicy foods,

12:00.920 --> 12:02.285
but bungee jumping...

12:02.755 --> 12:05.417
I mean, it's almost never sexy
to puke in public.

12:06.492 --> 12:08.517
- That's what I said.
- Really?

12:08.861 --> 12:09.919
Yeah.

12:10.563 --> 12:14.329
I mean, it's really nice down here and all,
but my bet is that they're gone.

12:16.435 --> 12:19.199
- So shall we?
- Sure. Okay.

12:25.177 --> 12:26.701
So, should we order?

12:32.618 --> 12:34.381
You know what? Let's get out of here.

12:34.553 --> 12:38.216
The service is awful,
and I need to show you Nice.

12:45.097 --> 12:47.065
You realize I'm going to make you tell me
your whole life story.

12:48.968 --> 12:51.163
Trust me, it's boring.

13:05.251 --> 13:06.445
- Want some of mine?
- Oh, no, no.

13:06.619 --> 13:10.077
Actually, I really don't drink that much.
I should slow down.

13:13.292 --> 13:15.123
- What do you do?
- Me?

13:15.594 --> 13:21.328
Consulting. I'm a consultant.
For a company. Company consulting.

13:23.569 --> 13:27.027
Lately we've been doing
a lot of downsizing. I travel a lot.

13:27.173 --> 13:29.505
Downsizing people.

13:31.377 --> 13:34.175
Well, if you could do anything, you know,
anything in the world, what would you do?

13:35.648 --> 13:37.639
I just think it would be nice
to put down some roots, you know?

13:38.784 --> 13:41.685
I've actually always wanted to know
my neighbors.

13:41.821 --> 13:42.913
I've never had that before.

13:44.890 --> 13:47.757
- That's actually pretty beautiful.
- You're pretty beautiful.

13:49.795 --> 13:52.889
- It's the dress.
- It's not the dress.

13:54.366 --> 13:56.163
You'd be beautiful without the dress.

13:56.735 --> 14:00.762
Not that I'm visualizing you naked.
Although I'm sure you would look...

14:00.906 --> 14:05.707
I'm saying that you would be beautiful
clothed differently, as well.

14:09.348 --> 14:11.441
Yeah. Thank you. I do need another.

14:11.584 --> 14:13.313
- Why don't I get you another.
- Okay.

14:13.485 --> 14:14.850
- Don't leave.
- All right.

14:24.563 --> 14:25.689
Stay put.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.967
Okay, fine. I will dance with you.

14:33.405 --> 14:34.565
I'm sorry, what?

14:34.707 --> 14:38.199
You almost ripped out of your dress
to try to seduce me.

14:38.344 --> 14:39.538
- It worked. Come.
- No, I was...

14:39.678 --> 14:41.305
- We dance.
- Okay, maybe just for a minute.

14:43.749 --> 14:47.276
Wow, you a very enthusiastic dancer.

14:53.759 --> 14:54.691
Oh, God.

14:55.427 --> 14:58.555
This is very nice,
but I should really get back to my date.

14:58.731 --> 15:02.167
- Now I blow your mind. Don't move.
- Now you're gonna blow my mind?

15:02.301 --> 15:05.293
- Okay. Oh, God. I think I felt something.
- Excuse me.

15:05.437 --> 15:08.372
- I'm gonna cut in here.
- Back off, Yankee.

15:08.540 --> 15:11.771
- Go find your own prostitute.
- No. No, you're misunderstanding.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.004
I'm sorry, I am not...

15:15.748 --> 15:18.410
- Does this dress say "prostitute"?
- No.

15:19.718 --> 15:23.085
It's not, really. It's just, it's maybe...

15:23.756 --> 15:26.350
- Wait. Just Jen.
- Yes.

15:26.492 --> 15:28.153
- Just Jen.
- Yes.

15:29.828 --> 15:33.320
There's something
that I've been wanting to do all night.

15:39.638 --> 15:41.629
- Your tag was still on.
- Oh, no!

15:41.774 --> 15:43.264
- I'm sorry.
- No. No, no, no.

15:43.409 --> 15:46.469
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Oh, God. No, it's...

15:47.212 --> 15:48.804
I can't afford this dress.

15:49.281 --> 15:53.047
I left the tag on 'cause I can't afford it,
not unless my father buys it for me,

15:53.218 --> 15:56.153
which he wouldn't, 'cause he's not here.

15:57.489 --> 15:59.514
- It's okay. It's fine.
- Oh, God.

15:59.692 --> 16:03.093
- Are you okay?
- No, I can't breathe. It's so tight.

16:04.196 --> 16:07.427
God, you know what? I'm sorry.
I can't keep this up. I am not this girl.

16:07.566 --> 16:11.161
I'm not spontaneous.
I never drink this much.

16:11.870 --> 16:16.967
And I don't live on the edge.
I live a very quiet, normal life.

16:17.109 --> 16:19.475
I would like a normal life.
I'd kill for a normal life.

16:19.611 --> 16:21.977
Well, it gets worse. Just...

16:23.082 --> 16:26.176
You know that guy at the restaurant
with the mustache?

16:27.586 --> 16:29.986
- The Russian pervert.
- That's my dad.

16:30.622 --> 16:31.554
- Wow.
- Yeah.

16:32.257 --> 16:36.284
- Sounds like a really bad home situation.
- No, no! Oh, God, no.

16:36.428 --> 16:40.762
He's not Russian. Or a pervert. He's a pilot.
You know, he flies planes.

16:40.899 --> 16:45.598
I came on vacation with my parents.
That's how lame I am.

16:46.505 --> 16:48.302
I was supposed to come here
with my geek boyfriend,

16:48.440 --> 16:49.805
but he dumped me for this girl in the...

17:01.053 --> 17:03.613
Sorry. Go ahead.

17:06.125 --> 17:07.353
I can't breathe.

17:08.594 --> 17:11.825
- This dress is really, really tight.
- Okay.

17:11.964 --> 17:14.489
I need to get out of it.
Seriously, I've been sucking it in all night.

17:14.633 --> 17:16.328
Can you just... You gotta get it off.
Just take it off.

17:16.468 --> 17:18.196
- Really?
- Yeah. Take it off.

17:18.337 --> 17:20.237
- Okay. All right.
- Yeah. Let's do this.

17:20.806 --> 17:21.738
It's...

17:24.309 --> 17:25.276
The zipper's stuck.

17:25.411 --> 17:28.141
Just break it,
it's fine, my father will pay for it.

17:28.280 --> 17:29.577
- Break it?
- Yeah, break it.

17:29.715 --> 17:33.617
Here, just turn. Stay... Don't...

17:34.653 --> 17:36.314
- Hold still.
- Oh, my God.

17:50.102 --> 17:52.263
- Here.
- Thanks.

17:53.705 --> 17:56.367
- I'll be... I'm gonna be over here, doing this.
- Okay.

17:57.709 --> 17:59.472
In this manner.

18:03.549 --> 18:06.347
Thank you for being so honest.

18:07.319 --> 18:09.981
I actually feel like I should
share something with you.

18:13.025 --> 18:18.122
It's gonna be really hard to say,
but I feel like you're real,

18:18.263 --> 18:21.460
so I wanna be real with you.

18:23.535 --> 18:26.060
I haven't really
told anyone this before, but...

18:30.242 --> 18:31.766
I kill people.

18:37.616 --> 18:40.210
Wow. You're taking this
a lot better than I expected.

18:46.225 --> 18:47.453
Awesome.

18:50.295 --> 18:53.822
I mean, usually it's bad people.
It's not like I'm out killing good guys.

18:53.966 --> 18:58.994
I'm not a murderer. I'm a professional.
I professionally kill people.

19:00.305 --> 19:01.329
You're a great listener.

19:02.875 --> 19:04.740
Excellent listener.

19:06.445 --> 19:07.673
I don't like what I do.

19:08.614 --> 19:09.808
Not a fan of it.

19:10.682 --> 19:12.206
But I like you.

19:21.426 --> 19:23.189
Tomorrow I'm going to show you Nice.

19:25.797 --> 19:28.459
And hopefully that's just the beginning.

19:30.302 --> 19:31.929
'Cause I like you.

20:39.504 --> 20:41.199
That was really heartfelt,
you know what I mean.

20:41.807 --> 20:43.069
I really appreciate that.

20:43.475 --> 20:45.238
Maybe a marzipan mushroom.

20:46.812 --> 20:47.972
I'm sorry. I've ruined it now.

20:48.814 --> 20:52.272
Oh, my God. This is really good.
You should take a bite.

20:53.385 --> 20:54.977
Go ahead and try it.
I'm not going to eat it all.

20:55.153 --> 20:57.587
I might eat it all if you don't eat some of it.

21:04.329 --> 21:05.261
Good Lord!

21:05.797 --> 21:06.729
French food.

21:10.302 --> 21:11.291
Try that.

21:11.436 --> 21:14.371
- I'm just going to go to the restroom.
- Okay.

21:33.625 --> 21:35.718
It's a crush, Spence, it happens.

21:36.828 --> 21:39.160
Go shoot some guns
and screw some models.

21:39.464 --> 21:40.931
You'll be good as new.

21:41.633 --> 21:43.123
Then what? Kill some more people?

21:43.468 --> 21:46.960
- They're enemies of the state, not people.
- You sure about that?

21:47.472 --> 21:49.565
'Cause five years ago,
Leveneaux worked for us.

21:49.941 --> 21:52.535
And then the NSA and then God knows
who else, but this week he's the enemy?

21:53.011 --> 21:54.171
What the hell's wrong with you?

21:54.713 --> 21:56.408
You go screw Pollyanna for a week,

21:56.548 --> 21:58.175
and suddenly your life's work
is out the window?

21:58.317 --> 21:59.443
She's normal.

22:00.018 --> 22:01.918
And I feel normal when I'm with her,
and maybe...

22:02.254 --> 22:06.281
Wake up! Her world only exists
because of people like us.

22:06.992 --> 22:08.892
And I'm sorry if people change sides.

22:09.294 --> 22:12.024
Sometimes a friend becomes an enemy,
and you have to take them out.

22:14.599 --> 22:15.566
She trusts me.

22:16.401 --> 22:18.528
And I'm not willing to compromise that.

22:18.870 --> 22:21.270
You know, these jobs
are not optional, Spencer.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.770
You don't get to just walk away!

22:24.142 --> 22:25.074
Watch me.

22:26.378 --> 22:29.814
You are who you are, Spencer.
You can't change that.

22:44.763 --> 22:46.128
I think the best part is that you're finally

22:46.264 --> 22:49.495
- with someone who's genuinely attractive.
- I know.

22:49.968 --> 22:52.129
I know. I keep thinking
I'm going to build up

22:52.270 --> 22:56.263
some kind of tolerance to his physical,
godlike perfection.

22:57.609 --> 22:58.667
But it just hasn't happened yet.

23:02.381 --> 23:03.313
No.

23:05.650 --> 23:07.675
Okay. It's a little early, Mom.

23:10.822 --> 23:11.754
Early!

23:14.793 --> 23:15.725
You think they're all right out there?

23:16.495 --> 23:18.156
As long as Daddy doesn't
shoot him, we're good.

23:26.838 --> 23:28.567
So I hear you're jobless.

23:30.742 --> 23:33.074
Corporate consulting's
a tough business, sir.

23:34.179 --> 23:36.272
Jen and I were talking
about putting some roots down.

23:36.515 --> 23:37.539
I might open up my own firm here...

23:37.682 --> 23:38.740
Look at my shoes.

23:39.651 --> 23:42.085
They're Edward Green.
I picked them up 20 years ago,

23:42.254 --> 23:44.620
when I was still flying the London route.

23:44.923 --> 23:47.357
If you have something of great quality,

23:47.859 --> 23:50.555
and you take good care of it,
you'll have it forever.

23:56.334 --> 23:58.097
I know you're worried about Jen.

23:58.336 --> 23:59.667
Why would I worry?

24:00.539 --> 24:01.801
I'm confident

24:05.477 --> 24:06.876
that you'll never hurt her.

24:08.113 --> 24:09.045
That's a nice shot.

24:09.347 --> 24:11.110
Thank you. I was an Eagle Scout.

24:13.418 --> 24:14.851
They really let you shoot
stuff in the Boy Scouts?

24:15.387 --> 24:16.319
So do the Marines.

24:18.023 --> 24:18.990
Semper Fi.

24:19.724 --> 24:20.656
That was yours.

24:20.959 --> 24:22.256
- I'm sorry. I thought...
- Be prepared, Spencer.

24:22.427 --> 24:23.985
You would have learned
that in the Boy Scouts.

24:29.534 --> 24:30.466
I was in 4-H.

24:33.872 --> 24:36.739
You know,
Jen's not some fragile china doll.

24:37.309 --> 24:40.710
She's funny and she's sweet
and she's smart,

24:40.912 --> 24:42.436
but in this kind of an off-kilter way,

24:42.614 --> 24:46.675
where one minute she can be talking about
the strategic value of Nice in World War II,

24:47.219 --> 24:49.881
and then next, she's telling me
that Cary Grant dropped acid.

24:51.590 --> 24:54.252
Which I... My point is,

24:55.594 --> 24:57.994
it doesn't matter what she says.
I can trust her.

25:00.031 --> 25:03.228
I depend on her, sir.
It's not the other way around.

25:05.070 --> 25:08.369
So, with your blessing,

25:10.509 --> 25:12.067
I'm going to marry her.

25:19.651 --> 25:21.084
Welcome to the family, Spencer.

25:21.620 --> 25:22.609
Thank you, Mr. Kornfeldt.

25:22.787 --> 25:23.947
Please, call me sir.

25:31.129 --> 25:32.357
How big is it?

25:32.497 --> 25:34.863
Oh, it's big.
It's probably the biggest on the block.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.096
Well, have I ever seen
anything like it before?

25:37.235 --> 25:40.602
Maybe in a magazine or in your dreams.

25:41.273 --> 25:42.797
Will I know what to do with it?

25:42.941 --> 25:45.705
I'll help you navigate the tricky parts.

25:46.278 --> 25:48.212
- Oh, God!
- Greedy, greedy!

25:48.346 --> 25:50.371
It's this blindfold. It's making me...

25:50.949 --> 25:52.678
- Honey!
- Sorry! I didn't...

25:58.156 --> 25:59.088
Prepare

25:59.991 --> 26:00.923
to be

26:03.828 --> 26:05.022
thrilled.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.864
Oh, my God, Spence.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.199
You remodeled my office.

26:13.038 --> 26:14.835
It's so organized!

26:15.774 --> 26:17.469
Okay. You can kiss me now.

26:22.847 --> 26:24.337
How'd I get so lucky?

26:24.749 --> 26:26.080
How did I get a guy like you?

26:26.251 --> 26:28.242
It was easy. It was your charm,

26:29.220 --> 26:30.152
and your wit.

26:32.624 --> 26:34.216
You really should not be spoiling me.

26:34.459 --> 26:37.257
Especially since

26:37.395 --> 26:39.386
- it's your birthday weekend!
- Come on.

26:39.531 --> 26:40.657
No, we talked about this!

26:40.799 --> 26:42.528
We're not gonna make a big deal
out of it this year.

26:42.734 --> 26:44.531
No presents, no parties...

26:44.669 --> 26:47.069
It's just dinner tomorrow night
with my parents, I promise.

26:47.205 --> 26:49.264
But I never agreed to no presents.

26:50.041 --> 26:52.635
Come on! I have been keeping
the secret for a week!

26:52.844 --> 26:54.311
I'm at my limit.

26:55.814 --> 26:56.838
You kill me.

26:59.918 --> 27:01.351
Open-dated tickets to Nice!

27:02.754 --> 27:04.722
I thought we could go back
to where it began, you know?

27:04.923 --> 27:06.584
And the best part
is that we can go any time.

27:06.891 --> 27:09.416
But, because I rule, I got
two weeks off at the end of the month.

27:13.665 --> 27:14.597
What?

27:15.500 --> 27:16.797
Do you not want to go to Nice?

27:16.968 --> 27:18.492
Of course I do, I... It's...

27:21.606 --> 27:25.098
Things are hectic at work right now.
And we have a lot going on here.

27:25.543 --> 27:27.477
Plus, the Peach Parade
is at the end of the month,

27:27.612 --> 27:29.443
and you were going
to make your cobbler, so...

27:30.682 --> 27:32.047
My cobbler sucks.

27:34.219 --> 27:35.186
You know what made Nice great?

27:38.390 --> 27:39.379
You.

27:40.759 --> 27:44.957
I have everything that I need right here.

28:05.283 --> 28:07.547
Hey, batter, batter, batter!

28:08.053 --> 28:09.486
Hey, batter, batter, batter!

28:13.058 --> 28:14.491
- Let's go! Pick up the pace!
- Hey, Spence!

28:15.593 --> 28:17.652
Here you go. Block party.
Bring your pudding, honey.

28:18.296 --> 28:19.320
Hey, Spencer!

28:19.998 --> 28:21.022
- Hi!
- Hey!

28:21.166 --> 28:22.133
- It's Lily and Mac!
- Hey!

28:22.267 --> 28:23.734
Hey, I'm glad we caught you.

28:24.135 --> 28:25.227
- Block party!
- Block party!

28:25.370 --> 28:26.598
- All right.
- Are you coming?

28:26.738 --> 28:28.501
- Yeah!
- You guys could dress up.

28:29.240 --> 28:30.172
- Perfect!
- Okay. Here.

28:30.308 --> 28:31.969
You know what? Here's another one!

28:32.310 --> 28:34.540
- Yeah, we're gonna have those wings.
- Great!

28:34.679 --> 28:36.909
That's got a little bit of my spit on it.
Don't clone me!

28:38.817 --> 28:39.749
Okay, we're going to go make love.

28:39.918 --> 28:41.408
- You have fun!
- Okay.

28:41.586 --> 28:43.110
- Take care. Have a good one.
- We'll see you there!

28:43.288 --> 28:45.085
Block party! Block party!

28:59.104 --> 29:00.833
Just get the saw through and just do it.

29:02.273 --> 29:03.900
As long as it's up to code.

29:05.243 --> 29:06.540
Who's paying us here for this, fellas?

29:14.786 --> 29:16.754
Our new Norton Internet Security suite

29:16.955 --> 29:19.515
has sonar behavior based protection
that defends against

29:19.691 --> 29:21.522
any unknown online threats,

29:21.659 --> 29:24.093
so be sure to flag that feature
for undecided clients.

29:25.730 --> 29:26.662
Okay, people.

29:27.365 --> 29:29.697
You heard her.
We're rolling this out immediately,

29:29.834 --> 29:31.165
so let's hop to it.

29:33.271 --> 29:34.203
Jen!

29:35.940 --> 29:38.340
- Polished and concise, as always.
- Thank you.

29:38.510 --> 29:41.104
Don't change a word
when you go to San Francisco.

29:41.479 --> 29:42.946
You want me to speak at the conference?

29:43.248 --> 29:45.842
No, I want you to dominate it!

29:47.352 --> 29:48.876
Okay! All right.

29:49.788 --> 29:50.948
You fly out tomorrow.

29:51.489 --> 29:52.979
But, Mr. Nootbar, tomorrow is...

29:53.958 --> 29:56.984
Well, it's such short notice.

29:57.395 --> 29:58.885
There's no one else you can send?

29:59.164 --> 30:01.394
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
We're all gonna get...

30:01.566 --> 30:03.727
- It'll be super cool.
- So cool. Yeah.

30:05.670 --> 30:07.137
The conference isn't until Monday.

30:07.405 --> 30:08.963
Just take the weekend to prep.

30:09.107 --> 30:10.438
- You'll be fine.
- Okay.

30:11.576 --> 30:14.204
Of course I didn't say
that it was Spencer's birthday.

30:14.345 --> 30:18.111
Because it is extremely unprofessional to
turn down a business trip

30:18.249 --> 30:21.013
to babysit your husband, birthday or not.

30:21.386 --> 30:23.320
And that's why I didn't mention it.

30:23.788 --> 30:25.187
Can you take him out tonight or not?

30:27.592 --> 30:30.152
Hello? Dad?

30:30.528 --> 30:31.517
If I have to.

30:31.663 --> 30:32.630
Love you, sweetie.

30:33.598 --> 30:35.566
I love you, too. Bye.

30:43.007 --> 30:46.909
No, no, it's too low.
Can you lift the back one up an inch?

30:47.045 --> 30:49.138
- No. Right there. Perfect.
- Vivian.

30:49.280 --> 30:51.612
Can you come in tomorrow? I'm sorry...

30:51.749 --> 30:53.979
Mildred's having trouble
with the billing again.

30:54.552 --> 30:57.885
- Saturday, Mildred and bills. A trifecta.
- I'm sorry.

30:58.323 --> 30:59.551
- Thank you.
- Fine.

31:00.491 --> 31:02.686
What do you think about this thing?

31:02.827 --> 31:05.921
Well, Henry says it's a statement piece.

31:06.731 --> 31:10.633
Yeah, but is it stating that we like
ugly shit hanging from our ceiling?

31:11.436 --> 31:12.368
Yup.

31:12.604 --> 31:13.571
Yup, what?

31:14.606 --> 31:17.404
Yes, you turned our conference room
into Bambi's nightmare.

31:17.542 --> 31:18.600
Yeah, I know.

31:18.743 --> 31:22.042
Hey, listen, do me a favor. Grab some
flooring samples for Olivia, all right?

31:22.547 --> 31:24.481
Something durable that cleans up easy.

31:24.916 --> 31:27.077
In case we decide to have sex on the floor.

31:27.252 --> 31:29.948
Of course. You're worried she'll vomit.

31:30.555 --> 31:32.921
I like her even more
when she's mean to me.

31:33.057 --> 31:35.753
- You're gonna get me in a lawsuit.
- Probably.

31:36.027 --> 31:38.393
She gets aggravated, though, you know,
when I flirt with other women.

31:38.529 --> 31:39.689
That's what it is.

31:39.898 --> 31:42.025
You do realize that only happens in pornos.

31:42.166 --> 31:43.997
Yeah, the good pornos.

31:44.569 --> 31:48.266
I'm gonna give her a shot as soon as
I'm done letting Olivia do dirty things to me.

31:48.406 --> 31:50.738
That's going to take awhile.
Olivia's a bigger slut than you are.

31:50.875 --> 31:52.934
Hey, are we gonna pretend
to play basketball tonight or what?

31:53.578 --> 31:55.443
No can do. I got dinner with Jen.

31:56.180 --> 31:58.080
I think I just saw your balls roll by.

31:58.216 --> 31:59.740
Yeah, you wanna go catch them for me?

32:01.219 --> 32:03.653
Just crushed it.
Just crushed one of your balls right there.

32:03.788 --> 32:05.619
Thanks, buddy. Well, see ya.

32:05.757 --> 32:07.748
Call me Ballcrusher from now on.

32:42.994 --> 32:44.120
So, how'd it go?

32:44.262 --> 32:46.924
Too good. Nootbar is
sending me to San Francisco.

32:47.098 --> 32:49.464
No, not the presentation. Spencer's gift.

32:50.301 --> 32:51.359
What did he say about the trip?

32:51.502 --> 32:53.197
He wants to stay home and eat cobbler.

32:53.338 --> 32:55.898
- No vacation sex?
- No French getaway?

32:56.040 --> 32:56.972
No.

32:57.108 --> 32:59.838
Who in their right mind turns down
a vacation like that?

33:00.311 --> 33:01.744
Well, you know Spence.
He's kind of a homebody.

33:02.280 --> 33:05.181
Okay, okay, okay.
How long have you two been married?

33:05.316 --> 33:07.113
- What, like, three years?
- Yeah.

33:07.285 --> 33:09.014
Okay, see that's your problem.

33:09.487 --> 33:10.579
I have a problem?

33:10.755 --> 33:12.689
Everyone always talks about
the seven-year itch.

33:12.924 --> 33:14.755
But no one mentions the three-year snooze.

33:16.127 --> 33:18.254
People get complacent.

33:18.496 --> 33:20.054
Get relaxed, but you have to be vigilant.

33:20.198 --> 33:21.665
Okay? Otherwise,
you're growing out your leg hair,

33:21.799 --> 33:22.925
you're growing out your down-there hair,

33:23.067 --> 33:25.535
and you're wearing your fat jeans
and a pair of Spanx, okay?

33:25.803 --> 33:29.569
And the next thing you know, he runs off
with a reality TV star named Shonda, okay?

33:29.707 --> 33:32.039
And that's my personal experience,
but I'm telling you, you better watch out.

33:32.176 --> 33:36.010
Because Shonda speaks six languages,
and one of those languages is sex.

33:36.481 --> 33:37.448
Are you gonna eat that?

33:37.582 --> 33:40.073
Getting the hungs. Super hungs over here.

34:06.778 --> 34:08.040
Peach Plaza Motel.

34:08.179 --> 34:11.739
Yes, I'm trying to reach a guest named...

34:13.684 --> 34:14.616
Sir?

34:16.087 --> 34:19.022
Yes. The guest name...

34:20.391 --> 34:23.360
- Annabell Hensler.
- Just a moment.

34:28.331 --> 34:30.891
Well, it took you long enough.
We need to meet.

34:31.034 --> 34:32.331
That's not going to happen, Annabell.

34:32.969 --> 34:36.063
You know, I get that you love
being the soft, suburban zombie.

34:37.108 --> 34:41.976
But like I told you three years ago in Nice,
you can't just walk away from this game.

34:42.112 --> 34:43.205
I got a job for you, kiddo.

34:43.347 --> 34:46.612
I'm out. You're going to have to
find somebody else to clean up your mess.

34:46.851 --> 34:49.978
My mess? If you don't do this job,
it'll be your mess.

34:50.521 --> 34:53.456
I'm in room 114. I'll be waiting for you.

34:54.025 --> 34:56.619
- Just do what I'm telling you.
- Spencer!

34:58.396 --> 34:59.522
- Spencer.
- Hey!

34:59.931 --> 35:00.989
Spencer.

35:01.399 --> 35:04.391
- Did you just hang up on someone?
- Nope.

35:06.137 --> 35:10.073
Jen's tied up at work so
I'm supposed to do something nice

35:10.608 --> 35:12.508
for your birthday. So here I am.

35:12.877 --> 35:15.345
- I'm going to feed you.
- Boy, that's great.

35:15.546 --> 35:17.138
But really, I can just grab
something real quick.

35:17.248 --> 35:19.148
Are you saying you'd rather eat alone?

35:20.084 --> 35:22.018
No. Of course not. I...

35:23.488 --> 35:24.853
Let's break some bread.

35:28.659 --> 35:29.591
Who's H?

35:31.362 --> 35:32.294
My old boss.

35:32.964 --> 35:35.762
Just asked me if I want my old job back.

35:37.502 --> 35:39.663
He sent you hugs and kisses?

35:40.404 --> 35:41.336
Yup.

35:42.006 --> 35:45.442
It's a French thing, you know,
they're always kissing. Fruits.

35:45.576 --> 35:48.306
I can't take you to dinner
dressed like a street urchin.

35:48.446 --> 35:52.075
So, we'll stop by your house,
and pick up adult apparel.

35:52.617 --> 35:54.016
I'll leave my car here.

35:54.819 --> 35:56.047
I will meet you out front.

36:13.804 --> 36:14.930
What's with you?

36:15.473 --> 36:17.873
You're like a chained Rhesus monkey
at the wheel.

36:18.643 --> 36:20.941
Just excited about the two of us
grabbing dinner.

36:27.118 --> 36:29.279
You and Mrs. K still thinking
about going on that cruise?

36:30.922 --> 36:31.889
Yes.

36:35.092 --> 36:36.787
Where are you gonna go?

36:36.928 --> 36:39.522
I really think
that's up to the captain, Spencer.

36:56.581 --> 36:58.014
What's with you kids?

36:58.382 --> 37:01.442
Jen shouldn't be coming home
to a dark house. It's not safe.

37:01.686 --> 37:03.620
I couldn't agree with you more, sir.

37:04.989 --> 37:06.923
Did I leave my keys in the truck?

37:07.191 --> 37:08.954
I am not telepathic, Spencer.

37:09.193 --> 37:10.125
Maybe I'm just...

37:10.294 --> 37:13.695
This is not Candyland.
Unlocked trucks get stolen.

37:14.198 --> 37:17.258
Which is why careful men use the garage.

37:18.336 --> 37:19.360
Thank you, sir.

37:19.503 --> 37:22.028
The keys are in the ignition.

37:29.614 --> 37:31.741
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

37:40.558 --> 37:41.582
- You got me good.
- Happy birthday, Spencer.

37:41.959 --> 37:42.891
Okay.

37:43.761 --> 37:44.693
Happy birthday.

37:45.396 --> 37:50.299
- I told you I wouldn't throw you a party on...
- On my birthday. Right. Very cute.

37:50.901 --> 37:53.131
- Not what you were expecting, right?
- No.

37:53.704 --> 37:57.367
Okay. All right. I'm going to run upstairs
and change really quick.

37:57.508 --> 37:59.942
Okay. We'll be down here waiting
when you come back.

38:03.180 --> 38:04.272
Surprise!

38:10.421 --> 38:11.911
Good job, Daddy!

38:15.459 --> 38:17.222
Good evening, Peach Plaza Motel.

38:17.361 --> 38:20.091
Yes, can you connect me
with Annabell Hensler, please?

38:20.264 --> 38:21.196
One moment.

38:26.003 --> 38:28.767
No answer, sir.
Would you like to leave a message?

38:28.906 --> 38:30.840
No, no message.

38:35.680 --> 38:37.147
I got a lot of work going on and that,

38:37.248 --> 38:38.738
so I don't know if I'm going to
make it this weekend.

38:38.883 --> 38:41.215
- We should hang out more. Yeah.
- We should. We should.

38:41.385 --> 38:44.821
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom real quick.
- Yeah, I'll join you.

38:45.890 --> 38:48.882
- Mama!
- Oh, sweetheart! Oh, dear.

38:49.093 --> 38:51.653
I was just telling Jen how you were going
to come over tomorrow.

38:51.796 --> 38:54.230
We can't let you spend your birthday alone.

38:54.765 --> 38:57.427
I got the block party, so... Yeah.

38:57.568 --> 38:59.058
- We could come with you.
- Yeah.

38:59.203 --> 39:00.170
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

39:00.438 --> 39:02.406
- Perfect. Great.
- Yeah?

39:02.940 --> 39:06.341
I'm coming, you lush.
Henry might be staying the night.

39:06.944 --> 39:10.573
I'm telling you, smoke on the water.
This chick was electrified.

39:14.385 --> 39:15.317
Okay.

39:19.690 --> 39:21.317
I need to get a fill-up.

39:23.794 --> 39:25.785
Got something there you think I might like?

39:25.930 --> 39:27.727
- I'll see you guys in a minute.
- Or something you might like?

39:27.865 --> 39:30.834
It's your party.
You get to have whatever you want.

39:32.269 --> 39:34.533
- Just wine.
- Having fun?

39:34.772 --> 39:37.366
- I like wine.
- I'll go open it.

39:37.508 --> 39:39.999
I'll be here with a birthday kiss
when you get back.

39:40.411 --> 39:41.844
I just hope that it was a good surprise,
you know?

39:41.979 --> 39:43.446
I mean, he seems kind of distracted.

39:43.581 --> 39:46.573
He wasn't expecting a house full of people.
Cut him some slack.

39:48.052 --> 39:49.986
Maybe Kristen's right about
the three-year thing.

39:50.121 --> 39:51.645
You would tell me, right?
You wouldn't sugarcoat it.

39:51.822 --> 39:53.881
Because with things like that,
it's just better to know.

39:54.058 --> 39:57.755
My legs aren't hairy, but I have been
in my fat jeans for the last two weeks,

39:57.928 --> 40:00.021
which may be why he would rather
stay home and make cobbler,

40:00.164 --> 40:03.099
than go on vacation with me.
I really am freaking out.

40:03.234 --> 40:04.667
What's going on with you guys?

40:06.237 --> 40:08.034
You got her all freaked out at lunch.

40:08.172 --> 40:10.163
Are you still having sex with Spencer,
yes or no?

40:11.008 --> 40:11.997
Yeah, all the time.

40:12.543 --> 40:13.532
Then your marriage is fine.

40:14.712 --> 40:16.612
Guys, can we please play charades now?
Come on.

40:21.619 --> 40:23.780
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

40:27.625 --> 40:29.684
- You sure you're all right?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

40:29.827 --> 40:32.159
- Oh, God. All right.
- Okay, maybe...

40:32.296 --> 40:34.093
- Watch the step.
...walk home.

40:34.231 --> 40:36.665
- Maybe he shouldn't be driving.
- He's fine.

40:41.405 --> 40:43.839
- No, no, no. Babe, I got it.
- No, honey. No, I got it.

40:43.974 --> 40:46.568
I'll put the house to bed,
you go start packing.

40:46.710 --> 40:48.803
- Babe, it's your birthday.
- I got it.

40:48.946 --> 40:51.107
- Are you sure?
- It's fine. Yeah.

40:51.749 --> 40:54.547
Okay. Just do the bare minimum.
I'll get the rest in the morning.

40:54.718 --> 40:57.278
- I love you.
- And you, too, I love you.

40:57.455 --> 40:59.184
Where are your pants?

41:27.852 --> 41:29.479
Is something wrong?

41:30.521 --> 41:32.079
No, of course not.

41:32.423 --> 41:37.190
Are you sure?
I mean, is everything okay between us?

41:38.996 --> 41:40.725
You're kidding, right?

41:41.632 --> 41:44.795
Come here. Come here. It's fine.

41:48.105 --> 41:51.802
Maybe I could skip the Kornfeldt
packing method just this once.

41:52.776 --> 41:55.643
Your flight's early.
You should keep packing.

42:48.065 --> 42:49.464
I should have just told Nootbar
I'd go tomorrow.

42:49.600 --> 42:50.567
I feel terrible missing your birthday.

42:50.701 --> 42:52.225
No worries. I've got another one next year.

42:55.906 --> 42:59.000
Well, hold on. Hold on.
You need your birthday kiss.

43:06.050 --> 43:10.282
Okay.
We don't want the neighbors to get jealous.

43:13.057 --> 43:16.754
Throw in a little porno in the driveway.
Don't want you to be late for the airport.

43:17.294 --> 43:18.556
- Let's get you going.
- Okay.

43:19.597 --> 43:22.122
Or you'll miss your flight. There we go.

43:26.804 --> 43:30.433
Hey, Jen, Jen! Hey, Jen.

43:30.874 --> 43:34.002
- Hey, Jackie.
- You're up early for a party animal.

43:34.144 --> 43:35.907
Yeah, I'm just running off to the airport.

43:36.046 --> 43:38.412
My Dougie says it's a good thing
we're such sound sleepers.

43:38.549 --> 43:42.508
Because, you know, a lot of other people
might have an issue with all that noise.

43:42.686 --> 43:45.746
Anyhoo, Dougie wants to talk to Spence
about this whole

43:45.923 --> 43:48.187
fence-on-the-property-line brouhaha
we're having.

43:48.325 --> 43:51.419
We don't want to bring lawyers into it
any more than you do, right?

43:51.562 --> 43:53.962
But we're quite sure our new fence
is not on your land.

43:54.098 --> 43:55.065
You know, you understand.

43:55.332 --> 43:56.594
Yeah, perfectly. Of course.

43:56.734 --> 43:59.601
But you understand, you're going to
have to take it up with Spence, right?

43:59.737 --> 44:03.138
Okay. Thanks, Jackie, I'm sorry.
I'm in such a big rush. See you soon.

44:03.273 --> 44:04.797
All right. Okay. You're late.

44:06.443 --> 44:08.843
Hey, did you guys have fun last night?

44:08.979 --> 44:12.346
Yeah, it was great.
Of course, I'm paying for it this morning.

44:13.384 --> 44:15.045
You're still taking Spence out tonight
though, right?

44:15.219 --> 44:16.811
Yes, for the hundredth time.

44:16.987 --> 44:19.285
Good.
Okay, did Daddy promise to be nice to him?

44:21.325 --> 44:22.622
Not in so many words.

44:24.395 --> 44:27.330
Just get yourself on the plane.
Let us take care of Spence, okay?

44:27.464 --> 44:29.796
Okay, well, I'll call you when
I get to San Francisco.

44:29.933 --> 44:31.992
- Love you.
- Love you, too, June bug.

44:37.841 --> 44:40.503
Call Chris, all right?
Maybe she wants to go to the park.

44:40.644 --> 44:43.636
- Okay. Yeah, that'd be fun.
- Sound good?

44:57.327 --> 45:01.024
- Who's that, you or me?
- Let's see.

45:02.633 --> 45:04.464
- That's me.
- That's you.

45:06.537 --> 45:08.767
- Here you go.
- You got any milk?

45:09.339 --> 45:12.172
- Yeah. Everything all right?
- Yeah.

45:15.579 --> 45:19.640
What have we got? I've got skim milk
and I've got some low-fat yogurt.

45:20.317 --> 45:22.080
You know what you can do?
You can mix the two together.

45:26.156 --> 45:28.488
- What the hell are you doing, man?
- You should have seen your face!

45:29.526 --> 45:31.460
- You almost crapped your pants.
- Yeah, that's really funny.

45:36.567 --> 45:37.625
God!

45:38.168 --> 45:39.965
- What are you doing?
- Killing you, buddy.

46:00.858 --> 46:05.192
Where you going, Spence?
You got a gun upstairs, or something?

46:40.731 --> 46:42.892
Surprise! I'm back.

46:44.768 --> 46:45.894
Spence?

46:52.743 --> 46:57.442
What are you doing?
Spencer, stop it. Stop, you're hurting him!

46:57.581 --> 46:59.344
- I need you to get me something.
- Stop it!

46:59.483 --> 47:02.646
Upstairs, in the bedside table,
there's a Glock.45.

47:02.820 --> 47:04.947
- A glot?
- It's a gun! Just go get it!

47:05.122 --> 47:07.090
- Why do you have a gun?
- Just get it!

47:19.336 --> 47:21.327
- Jen!
- Okay. All right, I'm coming, I'm coming!

47:21.471 --> 47:23.029
I kind of need you to hurry!

47:23.507 --> 47:26.169
- Okay, okay, here.
- Stay right there!

47:26.310 --> 47:28.676
Good job, honey.
Now, I need you to point the gun at him

47:28.812 --> 47:30.211
- and shoot him in the face.
- What?

47:30.347 --> 47:33.180
Don't do it! He's gone crazy!
It's a psychotic break... Don't do it!

47:33.317 --> 47:37.651
- Baby, just shoot him, please.
- Okay. Okay.

47:40.357 --> 47:41.756
The bitch shot me!

47:46.330 --> 47:49.265
- Are you crazy?
- You told me to shoot him in the face.

47:49.399 --> 47:51.993
I didn't think you were really gonna shoot.
I was telling you as a diversion.

47:52.135 --> 47:54.763
Well, then, you should have winked
or crossed your fingers, or something.

47:55.472 --> 47:57.030
Baby, I was a little busy trying not to die.

47:57.174 --> 47:58.766
- Oh, my God, I shot him.
- It's all right, he's just knocked out.

47:58.909 --> 47:59.876
- He's not dead. It's okay.
- I shot him.

48:00.010 --> 48:02.740
I need you to go to the basement
and get the duct tape.

48:02.880 --> 48:04.211
- What? Duct tape?
- There's duct tape downstairs.

48:04.348 --> 48:07.613
- Go downstairs and get the duct tape.
- I can't move.

48:08.151 --> 48:10.551
- Come on, baby. It's okay. It's okay.
- I can't move.

48:10.687 --> 48:13.554
It's okay. It's okay. He's going to be okay.

48:14.291 --> 48:15.349
Maybe.

48:19.529 --> 48:21.963
Spence, what is happening?

48:26.236 --> 48:27.203
I'm about to find out.

48:28.205 --> 48:30.571
- Wake up.
- Stop it, you're hurting him.

48:30.707 --> 48:32.231
Yeah, I think he'll be all right.

48:36.580 --> 48:37.842
Sorry I'm bleeding on your chair.

48:38.515 --> 48:40.210
- You just had it reupholstered, right?
- Yeah.

48:43.587 --> 48:44.849
You were under contract?

48:45.555 --> 48:47.318
Contract? For what, the business?

48:47.758 --> 48:50.352
Somebody hired him to kill me.

48:51.595 --> 48:52.857
Oh, my God!

48:53.630 --> 48:56.428
- I thought we were friends.
- Really?

48:56.566 --> 48:57.624
Because you never seemed that invested.

48:58.435 --> 49:00.767
I covered for you
with every client that we have.

49:01.238 --> 49:04.605
I talked a half-a-dozen hussy girls
out of slashing your tires.

49:05.242 --> 49:08.871
I even drove you to the free clinic
when your balls were swollen

49:09.012 --> 49:11.947
- and you had that fungal thing!
- No. Not really.

49:12.082 --> 49:14.676
- I helped you bury Sir Barks-a-lot.
- Hey,

49:15.152 --> 49:17.643
he was a good dog, all right?
Leave him out of this.

49:17.821 --> 49:20.346
- He couldn't fetch for shit.
- Spencer.

49:20.524 --> 49:24.460
Yeah? By the end of the day,
you're going to be just as dead as he is.

49:24.628 --> 49:26.755
You got a 20-million-dollar bounty
on your head.

49:31.368 --> 49:33.836
- Oh, God.
- You going to faint?

49:34.938 --> 49:38.101
- Not unless I puke first.
- Breathe.

49:38.241 --> 49:41.142
- It's okay.
- How is this okay?

49:41.278 --> 49:44.179
- I'll explain, just not right now.
- No. You explain now.

49:44.281 --> 49:46.215
I want you to explain right now.

49:48.318 --> 49:50.309
Jen? Spence?

49:53.023 --> 49:54.285
Hello?

49:55.225 --> 49:57.819
Yeah, that's it. Be very quiet.

49:57.961 --> 49:59.792
Maybe the other assassins will go away.

49:59.930 --> 50:02.899
- Yoo-hoo.
- It could be any of your neighbors.

50:03.033 --> 50:05.024
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

50:05.235 --> 50:08.033
What? You didn't think I'd have
some competition?

50:08.605 --> 50:10.732
Twenty million dollars buys
a lot of patience.

50:11.174 --> 50:12.402
Hello?

50:13.777 --> 50:15.870
I can see your car.

50:16.813 --> 50:18.542
Spencer, it's just Jackie Vallero.

50:18.882 --> 50:20.349
I know you're in there.

50:20.550 --> 50:22.916
She just wants to talk
about the property line or something.

50:23.120 --> 50:24.212
Or kill you.

50:27.224 --> 50:29.749
Hello, you two? Hello?

50:30.060 --> 50:31.994
Well, I'm here about the fence.

50:33.030 --> 50:34.497
- What do we do?
- Go.

50:34.798 --> 50:36.698
Now. Through the garage.

50:37.167 --> 50:38.464
What about him?

50:38.602 --> 50:40.365
- No, no, no!
- Spencer! Stop!

50:40.504 --> 50:42.335
If I don't, he'll come after us.

50:42.606 --> 50:44.039
- He's our friend.
- He's a liar.

50:46.510 --> 50:47.943
- Oh, my God!
- Down, down, down.

50:59.723 --> 51:01.452
- Get your seatbelt on.
- I am, I am.

51:06.129 --> 51:08.461
Jen! Jen! What's going on?

51:11.368 --> 51:13.199
- Was she holding a gun?
- I couldn't tell.

51:13.603 --> 51:14.729
Jen, everything all right?

51:26.183 --> 51:27.980
Good morning.

51:31.655 --> 51:32.587
Slow down!

51:32.722 --> 51:34.622
Stop the car right now!
I am getting out right now!

51:34.758 --> 51:35.952
Calm down. Sit down.

51:36.093 --> 51:38.357
I have a right to freak out!
I don't even know who the hell you are!

51:38.495 --> 51:40.520
It's me. I just have a different resume.

51:40.797 --> 51:42.992
Who do you work for? Is it the mob?

51:43.133 --> 51:45.499
I can't...
If I tell you, they could kill you, too.

51:46.169 --> 51:51.368
Let's just say I work for the blah-blah-blah,
and they gave me a license to blah.

51:52.843 --> 51:55.141
- I need air. I need air right now.
- Honey.

51:55.278 --> 51:57.246
- Oh, my God.
- Honey, it was never my primary directive.

51:57.380 --> 51:58.369
Are we even married?

51:58.515 --> 51:59.812
- I mean, legally married?
- Yes, we're married.

51:59.950 --> 52:03.113
- Not, like, "Married in your heart."
- I got out in France.

52:03.453 --> 52:05.546
I was in the love bubble in France,
and you were on the job.

52:05.722 --> 52:06.848
I was in the love bubble, too. It's not...

52:17.567 --> 52:19.865
Got something for you, Spence.

52:22.606 --> 52:23.538
Spread your legs.

52:23.673 --> 52:25.971
- No, you are not getting off that easy.
- Spread them. Spread them!

52:26.109 --> 52:27.041
Okay!

52:27.878 --> 52:31.746
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Here, take this.

52:33.483 --> 52:34.415
- Wait!
- Hold on.

52:42.592 --> 52:43.524
Thank you.

52:53.170 --> 52:55.229
He's on my side. He's on my side!

52:55.438 --> 52:56.666
- Here we go!
- Oh, my God!

53:04.781 --> 53:06.976
Cool! Race cars.

53:07.350 --> 53:08.282
Yeah!

53:26.870 --> 53:27.837
Damn!

53:28.905 --> 53:29.837
I got him.

53:31.074 --> 53:33.167
- You okay? All right.
- Yeah.

53:33.310 --> 53:34.572
He's gonna be close behind.

53:45.488 --> 53:46.420
Oh, God.

53:46.590 --> 53:49.252
- Hide. Hide. Now!
- What? Okay.

53:53.430 --> 53:55.830
- What are you going to do?
- I'm gonna kill him.

55:14.911 --> 55:15.843
Spence?

55:20.583 --> 55:21.550
Spencer.

55:33.963 --> 55:34.895
Get in the truck.

55:35.732 --> 55:36.664
Is he...

55:37.300 --> 55:38.232
Yeah.

55:42.305 --> 55:43.329
Start talking.

55:49.379 --> 55:51.006
I was recruited in college, freshman year.

55:52.982 --> 55:54.244
Why did they choose you?

55:54.818 --> 55:57.719
They look for independent people
and after my parents passed,

55:58.221 --> 55:59.552
I didn't have any family, so...

56:04.294 --> 56:05.488
We gotta go, babe.

56:08.131 --> 56:10.065
You can be pissed at me in the truck.

56:11.067 --> 56:12.398
Are you gonna kill me, too?

56:12.836 --> 56:15.896
Come on, if I was gonna kill you,
I'd have shot you back at the house.

56:16.139 --> 56:19.575
That sounded weird.

56:20.076 --> 56:22.738
Logically, you know that that's true.

56:24.581 --> 56:25.513
Okay.

56:32.689 --> 56:33.621
Spread 'em.

56:34.491 --> 56:36.459
For God's sakes,
what else do you have down there?

56:42.265 --> 56:43.425
How many people, Spence?

56:47.570 --> 56:49.629
Fourteen.

56:50.874 --> 56:53.104
Fifteen. It's fifteen.

56:57.013 --> 56:58.378
Is fifteen your real number?

56:58.581 --> 57:00.742
Or is that like when you ask a girl
how many guys she's slept with

57:00.884 --> 57:02.647
and you have to double it
and times it by ten?

57:04.687 --> 57:06.120
I didn't do that, I'm just...

57:07.357 --> 57:08.881
Fifteen is my number.

57:10.627 --> 57:12.527
They were all bad guys, as far as I know.

57:13.229 --> 57:16.562
But it was getting harder to tell.
And then I met you.

57:18.701 --> 57:20.396
We fell in love and I got out.

57:26.609 --> 57:30.443
My old boss reached out to me yesterday.
He's staying in a hotel on Piedmont.

57:32.482 --> 57:34.074
He'll know what's going on.

57:50.133 --> 57:51.464
Sweetie, your gun is showing.

57:51.601 --> 57:55.537
Well, where do you expect me to put it?
Have you seen the size of this thing?

58:15.191 --> 58:16.783
It's my dad. Should I take it?

58:25.335 --> 58:27.166
I thought you said
you were gonna change that.

58:33.343 --> 58:37.439
Sweetheart, relax. It's a little early
to check on Spencer, don't you think?

58:38.715 --> 58:40.910
And Jen will just be getting settled
at the hotel.

58:42.752 --> 58:44.185
Yeah, you're right.

58:57.734 --> 58:59.497
Spence. I got that.

59:00.403 --> 59:01.335
Over there.

59:20.523 --> 59:23.686
Easy. That's my old boss. Holbrook.

59:26.529 --> 59:29.521
It's two to the heart, one to the head.
It's old-school training.

59:30.133 --> 59:31.623
Had to be an experienced hitter.

59:36.539 --> 59:39.201
All right. Judging from his body,
it happened earlier this morning.

59:40.076 --> 59:43.170
It's okay, it's the adrenaline.
It'll go away in a little bit.

59:43.613 --> 59:45.706
How can you talk about him like that?
You knew him.

59:46.215 --> 59:48.911
That's my training, baby. I'm sorry.

59:52.855 --> 59:55.119
Spence, I can't stay in here.
I think I'm gonna get sick.

59:55.758 --> 59:56.952
Just give me a second, baby.

59:58.027 --> 01:00:00.427
He had to have some information
about the target.

01:00:02.298 --> 01:00:03.356
You already looked there.

01:00:06.035 --> 01:00:07.161
I'm missing something.

01:00:13.076 --> 01:00:15.772
It's the watch. It's wrong.

01:00:17.246 --> 01:00:20.215
He never wore anything this flashy.
Nothing to get noticed.

01:00:23.987 --> 01:00:26.478
- Look at this.
- It's broken. Who cares?

01:00:26.823 --> 01:00:30.623
No, no. It's a plug-in for, like,
a flash drive or something. It's missing.

01:00:31.761 --> 01:00:33.922
You're right. Someone's taken the drive.

01:00:36.032 --> 01:00:39.092
Okay. All right. Let's go.

01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:49.501
Do you think that Henry got to Holbrook?

01:00:50.313 --> 01:00:52.941
No. Henry wasn't green-lit
till this morning.

01:00:53.383 --> 01:00:54.907
There was another shooter at the house.

01:00:55.151 --> 01:00:56.709
I think we need to get out of here.

01:00:56.886 --> 01:00:58.786
- Absolutely.
- And go to my parents'.

01:00:59.288 --> 01:01:00.255
- No.
- Yes.

01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:03.052
- No. No.
- Yes. My dad will know what to do.

01:01:03.426 --> 01:01:07.226
No. I used to do this for a living, okay?
We do not want to involve your parents.

01:01:07.363 --> 01:01:08.762
And we definitely don't need help
from your dad.

01:01:08.898 --> 01:01:12.425
I think we do. Because your plan
to kill Henry and come see a dead guy?

01:01:12.568 --> 01:01:14.160
It's not really working out.

01:01:14.837 --> 01:01:18.364
I should have seen this coming. Of course
you're gonna rope your parents into this.

01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:20.567
You're a spy and a double agent,
but I'm the bad guy

01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:22.200
'cause I want to call my parents? Really?

01:01:22.445 --> 01:01:23.935
We've been married for three years and

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:25.843
we've never been more than five minutes
away from your parents.

01:01:25.982 --> 01:01:27.210
Do we need to do this right now? Come on.

01:01:27.383 --> 01:01:30.045
They're always coming over
and your dad's all,

01:01:30.219 --> 01:01:33.086
"Well, this is how the Kornfeldts
load the dishwasher

01:01:33.222 --> 01:01:35.952
"and mow the lawn clockwise
'cause that's the Kornfeldt way.

01:01:36.092 --> 01:01:37.923
"Take this piece of coal,
stick it up your keister,

01:01:38.061 --> 01:01:40.552
"squeeze it real tight like we do
and you'll make a Kornfeldt diamond."

01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:42.322
Okay, now hold up a minute.
You're talking about my parents.

01:01:42.465 --> 01:01:43.796
And I'm your husband.

01:01:44.667 --> 01:01:46.965
What are we gonna do
when we have our own kids?

01:01:51.574 --> 01:01:56.011
Jen. Jen, just talk to me for a second.
Look, I take it back.

01:01:56.412 --> 01:01:59.711
I love your parents.
I'm sending them a mental hug right now.

01:01:59.849 --> 01:02:01.282
- Look...
- Spencer! Hey.

01:02:01.451 --> 01:02:04.284
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good. I...

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:06.451
Your garage. It's a wreck.

01:02:06.656 --> 01:02:08.920
Yeah. It's was a party foul, the whole thing.

01:02:09.158 --> 01:02:11.718
You do realize we have
the block party tonight

01:02:11.861 --> 01:02:13.385
and it's a real eyesore.

01:02:13.529 --> 01:02:15.087
Well, then don't look at it, Pete.

01:02:22.238 --> 01:02:23.967
You can't just run off like that.

01:02:24.107 --> 01:02:25.802
You make it impossible for me
to protect you.

01:02:25.975 --> 01:02:27.442
Little late for protection.

01:02:30.413 --> 01:02:32.005
- What?
- Think about it.

01:02:32.281 --> 01:02:33.942
My emotions are all over the place.

01:02:34.083 --> 01:02:36.551
I'm picking up smells
that half the canine unit would miss.

01:02:36.719 --> 01:02:39.187
Plus I pretty much feel like vomiting
every time I breathe.

01:02:39.489 --> 01:02:41.787
- Baby, it's been a stressful day.
- Explain these.

01:02:45.495 --> 01:02:46.723
Aren't they always that big?

01:02:49.632 --> 01:02:50.826
You take the pill every day.

01:02:50.967 --> 01:02:53.060
I know, but I had strep last month,
remember?

01:02:53.603 --> 01:02:54.968
I had to take a Z-Pak.

01:02:55.204 --> 01:02:57.798
Antibiotics knock out the pill.
That's why I told you we had to be careful.

01:02:57.940 --> 01:03:00.272
I thought you were talking about
my technique, not getting knocked up.

01:03:00.409 --> 01:03:01.671
Okay, you know what?
Don't yell at me, sure shot.

01:03:01.811 --> 01:03:04.336
You're the one who suggested
naked Saturdays.

01:03:06.282 --> 01:03:08.546
- Can I help you?
- Stop it.

01:03:09.085 --> 01:03:12.111
- Be nice. Don't do that.
- What? She's staring. Staring is rude.

01:03:12.722 --> 01:03:15.156
Can we just... We're not in a library here,
let's just pick up the pace.

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:17.115
Well, they're not all equally accurate, okay?

01:03:17.293 --> 01:03:19.158
It's crazy to just stand out here in the aisle,

01:03:19.295 --> 01:03:21.126
so take one, take 'em all,
I don't know, who cares?

01:03:21.264 --> 01:03:23.198
I care. I care, Spence.

01:03:23.332 --> 01:03:26.995
It would be awesome to know
if I am actually making a little being

01:03:27.136 --> 01:03:29.195
inside of me, okay?
And don't you call me crazy.

01:03:29.872 --> 01:03:32.136
I'm not calling you crazy.
The scenario is crazy.

01:03:32.275 --> 01:03:33.640
- Standing here...
- You know, you're not helping.

01:03:33.776 --> 01:03:36.506
Folks? Could I be of some assistance?

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:40.477
Yes. Yes, you can.

01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:46.144
Kevin.
Which one of these is the most accurate?

01:03:46.322 --> 01:03:48.847
Jen, I don't think
he's a pregnancy test expert.

01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:55.662
Well, First Response seems to be
pretty popular.

01:03:56.165 --> 01:03:58.861
Can't seem to keep it on the shelf.
Here you go.

01:04:00.002 --> 01:04:00.934
Okay.

01:04:01.771 --> 01:04:03.705
- Must be your first.
- Pregnancy test?

01:04:04.106 --> 01:04:06.165
- Baby.
- Oh, yeah.

01:04:08.878 --> 01:04:10.937
Well, it may be your lucky day.

01:04:14.183 --> 01:04:15.741
God, stop it.

01:04:16.152 --> 01:04:17.585
Look at that, it's on sale.

01:04:18.721 --> 01:04:21.315
Great! That's great.

01:04:25.761 --> 01:04:26.693
Let's go.

01:04:27.129 --> 01:04:30.257
Thank you so much. Thanks. I'm coming.

01:04:34.637 --> 01:04:35.569
No judging.

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:40.238
I need to follow protocol and
report Holbrook's termination.

01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:43.471
We'll get a safe house,
you'll be protected there.

01:04:43.946 --> 01:04:47.712
I can figure out who Holbrook's target was.

01:04:48.251 --> 01:04:50.412
Maybe find out who
set this whole thing in motion.

01:04:50.586 --> 01:04:53.521
As long as I get to pee on the stick
and eat my delicious jerky, I'm in.

01:04:54.056 --> 01:04:58.152
Great. Listen. There's one more thing.

01:04:59.295 --> 01:05:01.695
You can't be upset. I need to steal a car.

01:05:02.398 --> 01:05:03.524
The truck's shot to shit.

01:05:03.666 --> 01:05:05.327
It'll probably be the least awful thing
we do all day,

01:05:05.468 --> 01:05:06.833
so go for it.

01:05:13.442 --> 01:05:15.501
God, I'm eating like I just got home
from fat camp.

01:05:16.812 --> 01:05:18.177
Glad you said it.

01:05:19.448 --> 01:05:20.380
Really?

01:05:20.616 --> 01:05:23.278
You wanna poke Mama Bear right now?
That seems like a good idea?

01:05:23.452 --> 01:05:24.544
All right, you're kind of scary right now.

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:25.982
- Just make your phone call.
- I'm just saying.

01:05:29.659 --> 01:05:30.853
You are go for contact.

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:32.659
This is Zulu One-Four-Niner.

01:05:32.795 --> 01:05:35.992
Sierra One-Zero-Zero
has been forcibly retired prior to contact.

01:05:36.132 --> 01:05:38.362
Please advise a secure location for briefing.

01:05:39.068 --> 01:05:40.262
Hold for further instructions.

01:05:42.104 --> 01:05:43.435
Zulu One-Four-Niner?

01:05:44.473 --> 01:05:45.405
It's my code name.

01:05:47.877 --> 01:05:49.003
Just not very catchy.

01:05:50.479 --> 01:05:52.606
Sorry, all the cool code names were taken.

01:05:54.116 --> 01:05:57.517
Zulu One-Four-Niner,
please confirm your contact and his status.

01:05:57.954 --> 01:06:00.718
Sierra One-Zero-Zero,
and his status is dead

01:06:00.856 --> 01:06:02.949
and I believe his target has put a hit on me.

01:06:03.125 --> 01:06:06.219
Negative,
Sierra One-Zero-Zero has no target.

01:06:06.529 --> 01:06:08.429
He is no longer an active agent.

01:06:08.564 --> 01:06:10.623
Please provide your location and...

01:06:16.472 --> 01:06:18.565
- What happened?
- Something's not right.

01:06:18.908 --> 01:06:19.897
Where are you going?

01:06:20.142 --> 01:06:22.201
Search Henry's stuff
and see if we can find out who hired him.

01:06:22.345 --> 01:06:23.471
Maybe there's a connection to Holbrook.

01:06:23.813 --> 01:06:26.179
And you can do your pee thing.

01:06:34.056 --> 01:06:35.353
I got it. I'm in.

01:06:35.758 --> 01:06:36.690
Nice.

01:06:38.894 --> 01:06:41.294
Porn, porn, porn.

01:06:42.298 --> 01:06:44.357
- Porn.
- Porn.

01:06:46.936 --> 01:06:48.733
People are so inventive.

01:06:50.473 --> 01:06:52.338
- They're, like, propped up there, man.
- Okay.

01:06:55.845 --> 01:06:57.107
Okay, how weird is this gonna get?

01:06:57.513 --> 01:06:59.310
Because there are some things
you cannot unsee.

01:06:59.448 --> 01:07:01.780
That's a picture of Henry's dog,
Sir Barks-a-lot.

01:07:02.385 --> 01:07:03.317
In costume?

01:07:05.688 --> 01:07:06.620
I don't know.

01:07:09.492 --> 01:07:10.424
Wait a minute.

01:07:11.961 --> 01:07:13.223
Look at the size of these files.

01:07:17.433 --> 01:07:18.593
Oh, my God.

01:07:19.668 --> 01:07:22.068
These are pictures from two years ago.

01:07:22.571 --> 01:07:24.471
I mean,
this was the first block party we went to.

01:07:27.343 --> 01:07:28.867
Whoever set this up was patient enough

01:07:29.011 --> 01:07:31.070
to embed Henry and God knows who else
into my life.

01:07:31.213 --> 01:07:32.202
- Our life.
- Our life.

01:07:37.219 --> 01:07:38.186
Wait, wait.

01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:42.821
I'm pretty sure your dad took that one.

01:07:45.494 --> 01:07:46.756
What is that supposed to mean?

01:07:47.897 --> 01:07:49.330
Nothing. Just an observation.

01:07:49.465 --> 01:07:51.933
Yes, an observation about my father
and that photo.

01:07:52.068 --> 01:07:54.400
Because it's a picture that he took.

01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:56.968
Okay, so now my dad is a bad guy.

01:07:57.206 --> 01:07:59.140
- I definitely did not say that.
- No, you're right. You're right.

01:07:59.275 --> 01:08:01.038
- Because you're a liar and a hit man...
- Okay.

01:08:01.177 --> 01:08:03.042
- All right. Here we go.
...and everyone probably is, too.

01:08:03.179 --> 01:08:06.444
So, I bet my mom's in on it,
and Gammy Kornfeldt, yeah.

01:08:06.582 --> 01:08:07.981
I think she's just messing with our minds,

01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:09.777
you know,
with the whole I'm-in-a-wheelchair bit.

01:08:10.319 --> 01:08:12.810
Okay, we are getting into
some counterproductive territory here,

01:08:13.122 --> 01:08:14.453
and I think we should move on
to something else,

01:08:14.857 --> 01:08:19.157
like maybe we should piss on a stick now.
That would be a good idea.

01:08:19.295 --> 01:08:21.421
That is a good idea,
because I do have to pee.

01:08:21.796 --> 01:08:22.729
Grab my gun.

01:08:23.631 --> 01:08:25.862
You can't just walk out in...

01:08:27.036 --> 01:08:29.435
- You are aware people are trying to kill us.
- I really have to go.

01:08:33.274 --> 01:08:34.537
Hold on. Hold on.

01:08:36.912 --> 01:08:38.310
For God's sake, just turn the light on,

01:08:38.447 --> 01:08:40.779
- it's not like there's a lot of places to hide.
- Just humor me.

01:08:44.153 --> 01:08:45.085
Why, thanks.

01:09:01.303 --> 01:09:03.635
I can't pee with you just standing there
staring at me.

01:09:03.839 --> 01:09:05.932
Honey, you've peed in front of me
a million times.

01:09:06.075 --> 01:09:07.939
But there's a little more pressure now,
don't you think?

01:09:12.648 --> 01:09:13.580
Better?

01:09:17.553 --> 01:09:18.484
No.

01:09:19.321 --> 01:09:20.252
Really?

01:09:33.135 --> 01:09:35.261
Honey, please, can you just give me
one minute?

01:09:35.404 --> 01:09:36.598
It's gonna take a minute.

01:09:36.872 --> 01:09:38.134
You can guard the door.

01:10:04.066 --> 01:10:05.727
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:10:06.468 --> 01:10:07.935
- You're here.
- You're here.

01:10:08.137 --> 01:10:10.901
Well, I'm glad. Look. There's a problem
with the Winkhigh account.

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:14.635
June, 2008, the billing?
You might want to take a look at it.

01:10:14.777 --> 01:10:17.837
You know what? I...
Let's forget the billing.

01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:19.413
We'll take care of it on Monday.

01:10:20.516 --> 01:10:21.676
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:24.280
- Okay.
- Great.

01:10:56.218 --> 01:10:57.276
Spence?

01:11:44.833 --> 01:11:45.765
Spence?

01:12:25.741 --> 01:12:27.072
Wait! You stop it!

01:12:28.911 --> 01:12:29.843
Stop it!

01:12:35.851 --> 01:12:38.046
Honey, I don't know how to...
It's not shooting!

01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:39.710
I don't... Oh, God!

01:12:57.206 --> 01:12:58.138
You okay?

01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:03.009
Baby, are you all right?

01:13:05.347 --> 01:13:06.279
I'm out of ammo.

01:13:10.652 --> 01:13:12.119
Bullets before babies, huh?

01:13:14.256 --> 01:13:15.917
Ammo's kind of important right now.

01:13:17.559 --> 01:13:18.491
What's it say?

01:13:22.631 --> 01:13:23.620
What's two bars mean?

01:13:24.867 --> 01:13:27.097
Hey, you gotta translate this for me.

01:13:29.037 --> 01:13:29.969
Hey.

01:13:31.206 --> 01:13:32.366
Am I gonna be a dad?

01:13:33.509 --> 01:13:36.569
I'm gonna be a mother. But I'm not sure yet
if you're gonna be a father.

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:46.478
Jen. Jen.

01:13:46.989 --> 01:13:49.389
I know you're upset,
and you have every right to be,

01:13:49.525 --> 01:13:52.426
- but I can't change who I was.
- Where does that leave us.

01:13:54.029 --> 01:13:55.428
- We'll figure it out.
- How?

01:13:55.597 --> 01:13:57.224
- I will keep you safe.
- How?

01:13:58.534 --> 01:14:00.593
Tell me how and I will stay.

01:14:07.476 --> 01:14:08.841
It's over, Spence.

01:14:11.814 --> 01:14:13.907
I know you don't want this to be over.

01:14:14.183 --> 01:14:17.118
What I wanted stopped mattering
the moment I saw those two bars.

01:14:24.693 --> 01:14:25.625
Where are you going?

01:14:30.032 --> 01:14:30.964
Jen.

01:14:33.168 --> 01:14:34.135
Jen.

01:14:35.504 --> 01:14:36.436
Jen!

01:14:54.289 --> 01:14:55.483
Olivia!

01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:10.029
Henry, who is calling you?

01:15:14.076 --> 01:15:15.008
You gotta be kidding me.

01:15:20.782 --> 01:15:22.147
Hey, Spencer, got a package for you.

01:15:26.555 --> 01:15:28.420
Relax, buddy, try a little decaf.

01:15:29.057 --> 01:15:30.422
Come around to the other side for me.

01:15:38.166 --> 01:15:40.327
Think it's that back-order fabric
from Tucson.

01:15:41.670 --> 01:15:43.035
Sure took its sweet time getting here, huh?

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:45.572
Yeah.

01:15:49.278 --> 01:15:51.007
I just need your signature on the top there.

01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:53.238
- Pen?
- Oh, yeah.

01:16:24.947 --> 01:16:25.936
I think I got him.

01:16:26.682 --> 01:16:27.614
Yeah, you got him.

01:16:28.016 --> 01:16:29.779
Oh, God. I'm glad you're okay.

01:16:30.118 --> 01:16:31.483
God, look at the windshield!

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:33.387
You must have really pissed him off!

01:16:46.301 --> 01:16:48.599
Is anyone not trying to kill me?

01:17:30.512 --> 01:17:31.444
Thanks.

01:17:34.449 --> 01:17:35.916
Let's go steal a car.

01:17:40.856 --> 01:17:42.380
So what do we do now?

01:17:43.358 --> 01:17:44.791
I don't know.

01:17:46.828 --> 01:17:48.261
Maybe some couples counseling?

01:17:51.466 --> 01:17:53.229
No, now.

01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:55.864
- Spencer, what do we do right now?
- Right now, right.

01:17:56.004 --> 01:17:57.699
- Right now.
- Right now we're gonna go to the house,

01:17:57.839 --> 01:18:00.000
I got a Go Bag,
we got money, weapons, passports.

01:18:00.142 --> 01:18:01.109
We're set.

01:18:01.243 --> 01:18:03.302
Why exactly
do we have a Go Bag, Spencer?

01:18:03.478 --> 01:18:04.843
Did you know this was gonna happen?

01:18:06.014 --> 01:18:07.174
No, I didn't know.

01:18:08.283 --> 01:18:09.614
You're lying.

01:18:09.785 --> 01:18:11.218
- You are lying!
- No, I'm not...

01:18:11.353 --> 01:18:12.342
Am I telling you everything?

01:18:12.521 --> 01:18:14.182
No, I'm not telling you everything.

01:18:14.356 --> 01:18:17.291
Okay? But we're married.
That's what married people do, honey.

01:18:17.426 --> 01:18:18.393
They lie to each other.

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:21.893
They tell people things that aren't true
to keep them safe,

01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:23.861
and to protect one another

01:18:23.999 --> 01:18:26.399
when they ask things like
if they have their mother's arms.

01:18:29.137 --> 01:18:31.196
Not that you have your mother's arms,
I'm not...

01:18:31.339 --> 01:18:33.364
- You lied to me the first time we met.
- No, I didn't!

01:18:33.642 --> 01:18:35.906
- No, I didn't!
- Unless your dad is a Russian pervert.

01:18:36.545 --> 01:18:38.979
Well, I came clean about that. You didn't.

01:18:39.147 --> 01:18:40.739
- You did not come clean.
- I did, too.

01:18:40.916 --> 01:18:41.905
- No, you didn't.
- I told you.

01:18:42.084 --> 01:18:43.415
I can't help that you were sleeping.

01:18:43.585 --> 01:18:45.450
I didn't know that
you sleep like a dead person.

01:18:45.587 --> 01:18:46.918
Come on.

01:18:47.489 --> 01:18:49.150
For all I know, you heard everything I said.

01:18:49.591 --> 01:18:50.649
Based on what?

01:18:50.992 --> 01:18:52.516
Based on... Your leg was twitching.

01:18:52.661 --> 01:18:55.152
God, you know, this is perfect.
This is just perfect.

01:18:55.297 --> 01:18:57.731
You couldn't have just been
hiding tranny porn in the crawlspace,

01:18:57.866 --> 01:19:00.300
like Susie Brent's husband, Murray.

01:19:00.435 --> 01:19:02.335
Really? Murray Brent?

01:19:02.604 --> 01:19:03.935
No, no, no, no.

01:19:04.072 --> 01:19:06.165
- You had to be a spy.
- That son of a bitch.

01:19:06.708 --> 01:19:10.474
I can't believe I married a spy.
What am I, Pussy Galore?

01:19:11.046 --> 01:19:12.274
Not that I know of.

01:19:12.981 --> 01:19:13.913
Excuse me?

01:19:14.483 --> 01:19:16.849
You're gonna complain now about
our sex life? Is that what you're doing?

01:19:17.018 --> 01:19:19.213
- I'm not complaining about the sex.
- That's what you're gonna do now?

01:19:19.387 --> 01:19:21.287
Pull the car over, we'll have sex right now!

01:19:21.423 --> 01:19:22.515
- No, we're going to my parents.
- Just get it on!

01:19:22.691 --> 01:19:23.817
- We are going to my parents!
- No.

01:19:23.959 --> 01:19:24.891
- I'm taking us to my parents.
- No.

01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:26.857
- We are not going to your parents' house.
- Yes, yes we are.

01:19:26.995 --> 01:19:28.121
- We are not...
- I said yes!

01:19:28.263 --> 01:19:29.321
Listen to me.

01:19:29.464 --> 01:19:32.331
We cannot go to your parents.
You have to trust me.

01:19:34.069 --> 01:19:35.434
I love you.

01:19:36.004 --> 01:19:37.471
And I will protect you.

01:19:37.606 --> 01:19:39.733
Now, you did a great job of finding a car.

01:19:39.875 --> 01:19:42.605
I need you to point it at the house,
and step on it.

01:19:44.079 --> 01:19:45.444
Okay, fine.

01:19:47.149 --> 01:19:49.117
I'm stepping on it, and it's not...

01:19:49.284 --> 01:19:53.084
It's not going. It's stopping, actually.
It's starting to...

01:20:01.196 --> 01:20:02.128
Great.

01:20:14.509 --> 01:20:17.342
Didn't notice the blinking fuel light?

01:20:18.513 --> 01:20:19.502
You're right.

01:20:19.648 --> 01:20:23.709
I apologize. Topping off the tank
should have been my first priority.

01:20:29.457 --> 01:20:30.890
Run, run!

01:20:42.170 --> 01:20:43.432
Go, go that way!

01:20:52.547 --> 01:20:53.479
Darn it.

01:20:59.287 --> 01:21:01.983
- It's locked. It's locked.
- Stop pulling it.

01:21:03.225 --> 01:21:04.954
- I missed.
- Really?

01:21:05.894 --> 01:21:07.691
Run, run.

01:21:18.773 --> 01:21:21.867
- Twenty million!
- You got them, sweetie.

01:21:22.644 --> 01:21:23.576
Now! Now!

01:21:34.055 --> 01:21:34.987
Come on.

01:21:35.190 --> 01:21:36.919
God, those Volvos are amazing.

01:21:42.764 --> 01:21:44.254
- Shit.
- It's a block party.

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:47.368
Stay close, keep moving.

01:21:57.178 --> 01:21:58.702
Walnut muffin?

01:22:04.185 --> 01:22:05.812
Everyone's a winner!

01:22:14.562 --> 01:22:15.995
Winner. Winner. We got a winner.

01:22:16.131 --> 01:22:17.928
Pop a balloon, win a prize.

01:22:20.068 --> 01:22:21.501
Corndogs, get your corndogs!

01:22:21.803 --> 01:22:25.102
Hey, you guys.
Hey, Spence-Spence, Jen-Jen.

01:22:25.473 --> 01:22:28.033
Jen-Bear, where you guys going?
They got corndogs.

01:22:28.276 --> 01:22:29.834
They got regular,
and they got bacon-covered.

01:22:29.978 --> 01:22:30.910
Oh, really?

01:22:31.046 --> 01:22:33.378
Hey, honey, there's no way
she's packing heat.

01:22:33.748 --> 01:22:36.649
You'd be surprised
where people hide stuff.

01:22:37.085 --> 01:22:39.178
Guys, can I use the bathroom
in your house?

01:22:40.221 --> 01:22:41.188
Number one.

01:22:42.624 --> 01:22:44.421
- Where is the Go Bag?
- In the office.

01:22:44.726 --> 01:22:46.455
Stay away from the windows, okay?

01:22:46.594 --> 01:22:49.324
The safe is underneath the carpet,
the combination's our anniversary.

01:22:50.031 --> 01:22:50.963
Where are you going?

01:22:51.333 --> 01:22:52.766
To get the guns.

01:22:53.768 --> 01:22:56.362
Get the guns. More guns. That's great.

01:23:23.999 --> 01:23:26.126
Bothilda Walfredson?

01:23:26.935 --> 01:23:28.266
I'm Swedish.

01:23:28.970 --> 01:23:29.902
That's neat.

01:23:34.843 --> 01:23:36.003
Spence?

01:23:37.379 --> 01:23:38.641
Spencer, is that you?

01:23:52.827 --> 01:23:53.816
Spence?

01:23:56.231 --> 01:23:58.028
Spencer, is that you?

01:24:04.239 --> 01:24:06.366
Oh, God. Mom.

01:24:07.575 --> 01:24:09.668
Hey, you know,
it is actually not a great time.

01:24:10.145 --> 01:24:11.772
You think?

01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:16.939
Kristen?

01:24:18.753 --> 01:24:19.879
You know, actually,
that kind of makes sense.

01:24:20.789 --> 01:24:23.189
Lower your gun, or it's last call for Mommy.

01:24:50.251 --> 01:24:51.445
I told you she's not a nice girl.

01:24:51.719 --> 01:24:52.651
You told her that?

01:24:52.954 --> 01:24:53.886
It's very rude.

01:24:58.860 --> 01:25:01.090
- God damn it! Who is up there?
- I don't know.

01:25:01.229 --> 01:25:03.891
If somebody shoots Mr. Perfect
before I have the chance to,

01:25:04.032 --> 01:25:06.330
I will kill you both, on principle.

01:25:06.835 --> 01:25:09.133
Lower your gun, now.

01:25:17.579 --> 01:25:18.876
Check it out, honey.

01:25:24.953 --> 01:25:26.477
Lily, no!

01:25:33.828 --> 01:25:36.262
Just let my mom go, okay?
I am all the leverage you need.

01:25:36.397 --> 01:25:40.265
I didn't spend the last three years
listening to you babble incessantly

01:25:41.402 --> 01:25:42.460
about your perfect little life

01:25:42.837 --> 01:25:44.566
to "F" it all up now.

01:25:44.706 --> 01:25:47.937
So get in the living room, both of you.
Let's go.

01:25:48.076 --> 01:25:49.543
Let's go!

01:25:50.478 --> 01:25:51.809
Let's go.

01:25:53.148 --> 01:25:54.877
- Turn around.
- Come here, dear.

01:25:55.016 --> 01:25:56.005
Come on.

01:25:59.487 --> 01:26:01.717
- You okay, you all right?
- Jen, to be fair,

01:26:02.957 --> 01:26:04.083
we did have some good times.

01:26:04.692 --> 01:26:06.250
- Yeah.
- Remember...

01:26:10.565 --> 01:26:11.759
There you are, dear.

01:26:16.171 --> 01:26:17.160
Answer the phone, sir.

01:26:18.706 --> 01:26:22.164
My dead best friend wants to let you know
that your target's still alive.

01:26:22.777 --> 01:26:25.769
- Stand down, Spencer.
- Whoa, hey, guys.

01:26:26.514 --> 01:26:28.175
He killed Holbrook.

01:26:28.383 --> 01:26:29.714
Two to the heart,
one to the head, remember?

01:26:35.056 --> 01:26:36.546
And then he pulled the trigger on me.

01:26:38.693 --> 01:26:39.785
Daddy, is that true?

01:26:39.928 --> 01:26:43.830
I put sleepers in your life
because I didn't trust your husband.

01:26:44.599 --> 01:26:47.090
I hoped I'd never have to use it.

01:26:48.002 --> 01:26:50.163
It's the flash drive from Holbrook's watch.

01:26:50.305 --> 01:26:51.670
It's all there.

01:26:51.806 --> 01:26:53.967
His old boss turned dirty.

01:26:54.342 --> 01:26:57.709
And in your office, when I saw that card
with his name on it,

01:26:57.845 --> 01:27:00.541
I knew you were back in the game
and you were coming after me.

01:27:04.786 --> 01:27:06.310
So I activated the killers.

01:27:06.487 --> 01:27:08.978
I'm not trying to kill you, sir.

01:27:09.224 --> 01:27:11.784
Why don't you tell her about Nice,
where you tried to blow me up?

01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:13.049
How do you know about Nice?

01:27:13.328 --> 01:27:15.228
I was supposed to be on that helicopter.

01:27:16.231 --> 01:27:18.461
When I saw you, I didn't go.

01:27:21.769 --> 01:27:24.636
You said you got out
when we met in France.

01:27:24.772 --> 01:27:26.296
You said you were in the love bubble.

01:27:26.574 --> 01:27:27.871
I got out. I'm out.

01:27:28.109 --> 01:27:30.441
Just look at him.
Does he look like he's out?

01:27:30.678 --> 01:27:32.703
It was my last job. I'm out.

01:27:33.681 --> 01:27:35.046
I got out.

01:27:36.217 --> 01:27:37.184
For us.

01:27:40.054 --> 01:27:42.022
And I'm never going back.

01:27:57.505 --> 01:27:59.632
So you are not a pilot? Is that what we're...

01:28:03.111 --> 01:28:04.339
Daddy, enough. Put your gun down.

01:28:04.479 --> 01:28:06.379
I have been dodging bullets all day
thanks to you

01:28:06.514 --> 01:28:07.606
and it is not good for the baby.

01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:09.946
- You have a baby?
- No, I'm going to.

01:28:10.318 --> 01:28:11.546
I knew it.

01:28:12.153 --> 01:28:13.120
- Let's celebrate.
- Okay.

01:28:13.321 --> 01:28:14.345
I'm gonna be a grandpa?

01:28:14.622 --> 01:28:15.554
Yes.

01:28:20.061 --> 01:28:21.085
Oh, God.

01:28:24.365 --> 01:28:25.332
Oh, my God.

01:28:26.334 --> 01:28:27.562
And you're the father?

01:28:27.969 --> 01:28:28.936
For God's sakes, Dad.

01:28:30.538 --> 01:28:31.869
Oh, my God.

01:28:37.345 --> 01:28:40.109
Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:28:40.581 --> 01:28:41.513
Okay.

01:28:41.649 --> 01:28:43.241
This would be a great time for a trust circle.

01:28:44.052 --> 01:28:45.314
- Trust circle?
- Yes.

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:46.778
- No.
- Yeah.

01:28:48.656 --> 01:28:50.317
Yeah, let's do that.
Okay, let's gather, everybody.

01:28:50.692 --> 01:28:52.887
Dad, pull up a chair. Mother, join us.

01:28:53.294 --> 01:28:54.261
Okay.

01:28:54.729 --> 01:28:55.661
Okay.

01:28:56.364 --> 01:28:58.229
I don't do trust circles.

01:28:58.366 --> 01:29:01.733
I know, Mother,
but I think that this is necessary. Humor me.

01:29:01.969 --> 01:29:07.771
Okay, I finally understand that
I am not to blame for this dynamic, okay?

01:29:08.242 --> 01:29:09.174
You are.

01:29:09.744 --> 01:29:11.712
And you need to own that.

01:29:12.313 --> 01:29:14.679
I need to own the fact
that I unwittingly married

01:29:15.016 --> 01:29:18.281
the one man who's exactly like my father.

01:29:19.687 --> 01:29:20.711
A liar.

01:29:21.422 --> 01:29:25.153
So, if any of you wanna ever see this kid,

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:28.224
this is what's gonna happen, okay?

01:29:28.529 --> 01:29:30.861
There will be no more lying.

01:29:31.466 --> 01:29:35.197
No more stealing cars,
or hiding weapons in the furniture,

01:29:35.336 --> 01:29:38.328
and I never wanna see you two
try to kill each other again, okay?

01:29:38.473 --> 01:29:40.566
In fact, there will be no more killing.

01:29:40.708 --> 01:29:44.041
I don't wanna see you
swat a fucking fly, okay? All right?

01:29:44.612 --> 01:29:45.977
Are we all together on this?

01:29:46.114 --> 01:29:47.081
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:29:47.215 --> 01:29:48.807
Great job, baby.

01:29:50.885 --> 01:29:52.785
Is there anything else

01:29:53.454 --> 01:29:55.752
that I need to, or should, know?

01:29:56.691 --> 01:29:57.851
Anyone?

01:29:59.093 --> 01:30:00.151
Spencer?

01:30:01.996 --> 01:30:04.362
English is not my first language.

01:30:14.776 --> 01:30:19.873
And also,
the third week that we were together,

01:30:21.048 --> 01:30:24.279
you said, "I love you" in your sleep.

01:30:26.888 --> 01:30:31.291
And I didn't tell you because I wanted to be
the one who said it first.

01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:33.692
I'm sorry.

01:30:36.531 --> 01:30:37.691
Thank you, honey.

01:30:39.233 --> 01:30:40.222
Mom?

01:30:44.705 --> 01:30:48.698
Dear, you remember that time that I took
you and your little friend for a boat ride?

01:30:49.877 --> 01:30:50.809
No.

01:30:51.245 --> 01:30:53.839
No? Well, forget it then. We're good.

01:30:56.851 --> 01:30:57.783
Okay.

01:31:00.288 --> 01:31:03.416
Okay, fine, in addition to planting killers
in your life

01:31:03.558 --> 01:31:05.822
and secretly working
for a government agency,

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:07.928
I would like to admit...

01:31:12.233 --> 01:31:13.427
Yoo-hoo!

01:31:15.937 --> 01:31:16.926
Jen?

01:31:18.673 --> 01:31:21.301
We need to talk about
that darn property line.

01:31:23.444 --> 01:31:24.411
Hi, Jen.

01:31:30.952 --> 01:31:33.113
Sweetie, I don't think she was a killer.

01:31:34.088 --> 01:31:35.385
I know.

01:31:42.196 --> 01:31:46.496
- Red wire crosses blue, good as new.
- Blue crosses red, good as dead.

01:31:46.634 --> 01:31:47.931
I know, it's my saying.

01:31:48.069 --> 01:31:50.799
That's not your saying, that's my saying.
You copied me.

01:31:50.938 --> 01:31:53.805
I didn't copy.
I have not copied you a day in my life.

01:31:54.509 --> 01:31:55.441
Really?

01:31:56.177 --> 01:31:57.337
I think it's coming in nice, don't you?

01:31:57.678 --> 01:31:58.667
No.

01:32:00.615 --> 01:32:02.810
He likes it, don't you, buddy?

01:32:03.184 --> 01:32:05.778
You like Daddy's mustache, don't you?

01:32:05.953 --> 01:32:07.284
Don't you like that mustache?

01:32:07.588 --> 01:32:09.783
- How's my little big guy doing?
- I'm great.

01:32:09.924 --> 01:32:11.949
Except your dad thinks I'm copying him,
which I'm not.

01:32:12.126 --> 01:32:13.616
Will you please tell him
I'm not copying him?

01:32:14.362 --> 01:32:16.922
Sorry, sweetie, every girl marries her father.

01:32:17.098 --> 01:32:18.030
That's not gross.

01:32:18.232 --> 01:32:21.201
I certainly did.
My father was one handsome man.

01:32:21.936 --> 01:32:23.836
Well built, rippling muscles,

01:32:24.171 --> 01:32:25.763
his mustache was a lot larger
than yours, though.

01:32:26.741 --> 01:32:28.971
- Thick, like a Balkan forest.
- That's nice, Mother.

01:32:29.377 --> 01:32:31.436
But you're here to babysit,
not creep me out.

01:32:31.579 --> 01:32:33.444
- So, if you wouldn't mind...
- Hi.

01:32:35.983 --> 01:32:38.543
Yeah, Grandma's a little scary, yeah.

01:32:41.222 --> 01:32:43.281
Maybe it's too soon.
Maybe we should just stay.

01:32:43.457 --> 01:32:46.483
No, it's not too soon.
We're not staying, it's date night.

01:32:46.627 --> 01:32:49.027
We're gonna go out, it's gonna be great.
I'm wearing my skinny jeans.

01:32:49.163 --> 01:32:51.028
Don't worry, Spencer, you can trust us.

01:32:55.903 --> 01:32:57.768
If we can't trust them,
who can we trust, right?

01:32:57.905 --> 01:32:59.065
Right.

01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:00.939
Bye, buddy.
