WEBVTT

00:05.649 --> 00:08.684
Arcee, a vehicular form
is approaching.

00:08.686 --> 00:09.752
Decepticon?

00:16.388 --> 00:18.265
Mom.

00:18.267 --> 00:20.100
Again?

00:20.102 --> 00:21.807
She worries.

00:27.016 --> 00:29.519
Hi, honey.

00:29.521 --> 00:30.857
Hey.

00:30.859 --> 00:32.465
Hey, uh...

00:32.467 --> 00:34.671
Finished my shift early
at the hospital,

00:34.673 --> 00:36.273
so I thought I'd swing by.

00:36.275 --> 00:37.877
Good to see you again, doctor.

00:39.451 --> 00:41.888
Arcee.

00:41.890 --> 00:43.957
So, where's Optimus?

00:43.959 --> 00:46.261
On a scouting mission
with Bumblebee.

00:46.263 --> 00:47.896
Sorry to disappoint.

00:47.898 --> 00:50.167
And I wore heels
and everything.

00:50.169 --> 00:51.902
Mom!

00:51.904 --> 00:53.771
That's odd.

00:53.773 --> 00:58.510
This is an extremely unusual
magnetic flux for any planet.

00:58.512 --> 01:02.882
I recognize this magnetic
signature, soundwave.

01:02.884 --> 01:04.617
And it would be unfortunate

01:04.619 --> 01:09.023
to have a Decepticon invention
such as this used against us.

01:09.025 --> 01:11.261
I will secure the weapon,
lord Megatron.

01:11.263 --> 01:13.966
Breakdown? Hah.

01:13.968 --> 01:16.603
If you can be bested
my mere humans,

01:16.605 --> 01:20.110
what chance do you have
against the Autobots?

01:20.112 --> 01:22.481
Allow me
to redeem myself, master.

01:22.483 --> 01:26.185
What I have lost
is a constant reminder

01:26.187 --> 01:29.423
that I must never again
fail you.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.074

02:26.756 --> 02:29.023
Did you feel the G's
on that last turn?

02:29.025 --> 02:30.925
Bulkhead's an animal!

02:33.096 --> 02:36.931
<i>Remember when this used to be
a secret clubhouse?</i>

02:36.933 --> 02:38.633
Uh, don't worry,
Ms. Darby.

02:38.635 --> 02:40.268
We were wearing seatbelts.

02:40.270 --> 02:42.437
I'm sure you were, Rafael.

02:42.439 --> 02:44.472
Hi, Miko.
How's school going?

02:44.474 --> 02:46.808
Why?
What'd you hear?

02:46.810 --> 02:49.544
Let's do this thing, Jack.

02:49.546 --> 02:53.514
But I just got here.
I brought sandwiches.

02:53.516 --> 02:54.883
Mom!

02:54.885 --> 02:57.652
I really need to help Arcee test
her upgraded tracking system.

02:57.654 --> 02:59.820
Well, just be careful.

02:59.822 --> 03:01.855
There's nothing
to be careful about.

03:01.857 --> 03:03.457
It's a routine diagnostic.

03:03.459 --> 03:04.992
Are you sure
you need Jack for that?

03:06.194 --> 03:08.995
Uh-oh.

03:08.997 --> 03:10.998
Bulkhead, I need you
back in the field

03:11.000 --> 03:13.233
to investigate
an odd magnetic disturbance.

03:13.235 --> 03:14.401
I'll go with!

03:14.403 --> 03:17.305
Whoa.
Stay put, Miko.

03:21.210 --> 03:22.911
Why aren't you going with him?

03:22.913 --> 03:25.147
Someone thinks it's not safe.

03:25.149 --> 03:27.383
But it's safe for Jack
to go with Arcee?

03:27.385 --> 03:29.851
Mom, totally different.

03:29.853 --> 03:30.919
Oh. How?

03:30.921 --> 03:32.588
Mother knows best, Jack.

03:32.590 --> 03:34.156
Wait up, Bulkhead.

03:34.158 --> 03:35.990
<i>I'm going with.</i>

03:38.226 --> 03:39.259
Wh... ah!

03:40.629 --> 03:42.328
What'd I say?

03:46.732 --> 03:48.433
Jackpot.

04:22.931 --> 04:25.566
For me?
You shouldn't have.

04:25.568 --> 04:26.567
I didn't.

04:26.569 --> 04:27.568
Unh!

04:31.306 --> 04:34.240
I heard a rumor
about a rogue 'con.

04:34.242 --> 04:37.043
How about I hog-tie you
and haul you in?

04:40.648 --> 04:43.549
Huh.
The primitive type.

04:43.551 --> 04:45.417
Raaah!

04:50.154 --> 04:53.223
Not much for depth perception
anymore, are you?

04:53.225 --> 04:56.326
Well, not much for looks
anymore.

04:56.328 --> 04:57.326
Raaah!

05:07.269 --> 05:09.203
Raah!

05:29.960 --> 05:32.828
It was a lovely burial.

05:35.166 --> 05:39.235
Sorry.
Can't quite understand you.

05:41.706 --> 05:43.574
Raaah!

05:49.346 --> 05:50.713
Raaah!

05:55.419 --> 05:57.954
Don't take it
so personal, Arcee.

05:57.956 --> 06:00.856
Jack's mother's
just...protective.

06:00.858 --> 06:04.292
Well, I protected her son for
months before she had a clue.

06:04.294 --> 06:07.262
Suddenly she wakes up to
reality, and I'm not enough.

06:07.264 --> 06:09.597
No kidding.

06:09.599 --> 06:12.167
Can't we ban her from the base?

06:12.169 --> 06:13.568
Miko, how did you...

06:13.570 --> 06:14.869
Gonna need a bridge.

06:14.871 --> 06:17.304
Wait, don't send me back
to helicopter mom.

06:19.040 --> 06:22.642
It's just...I miss the way
things were.

06:22.644 --> 06:25.345
Strike that, Ratchet.
It's only recon.

06:25.347 --> 06:27.481
She's safe with us.

06:29.184 --> 06:31.319
Sweet!

06:31.321 --> 06:34.489
Crank up track seven, Bulk.

06:34.491 --> 06:35.991
Track seven?

06:39.663 --> 06:43.732
Don't you think that's
a little loud for recon?

06:45.536 --> 06:48.237
Aww.

06:48.239 --> 06:51.006
A Scout should be silent,
but deadly.

06:54.211 --> 06:55.711
What?

06:55.713 --> 06:57.679
"Silent, but deadly"

06:57.681 --> 07:01.183
means something completely
different on earth.

07:01.185 --> 07:04.519
Bulk, let's get our recon on.

07:04.521 --> 07:06.754
I always take point.

07:06.756 --> 07:10.225
I know, but Miko likes to be
up front so she can see.

07:12.461 --> 07:15.297
No matter where I turn,
I'm the third wheel.

07:22.671 --> 07:25.874
Hmm. Looks like Ratchet's
magnetic flux is coming from...

07:38.754 --> 07:39.888
Airachnid.

07:39.890 --> 07:41.189
And Breakdown.

07:41.191 --> 07:43.925
Both your archenemies,
and they're mashing it up.

07:48.063 --> 07:49.464
<i>Over that.</i>

07:49.466 --> 07:51.466
The source
of the magnetic disturbance.

07:51.468 --> 07:54.369
All right.
What's the plan?

07:57.573 --> 08:01.676
Miko, don't move.
I mean it.

08:01.678 --> 08:02.877
Aww!

08:21.862 --> 08:23.496
Arcee.

08:23.498 --> 08:25.865
And look...

08:25.867 --> 08:29.135
You brought a new partner
for me to snuff.

08:29.137 --> 08:30.970
That would be Bulkhead.

08:30.972 --> 08:32.105
Who asked you?

08:32.107 --> 08:33.072
Launch me.

08:46.288 --> 08:48.523
Raaaah!

08:48.525 --> 08:50.992
No, she's mine.

08:53.695 --> 08:54.695
Watch out for...

08:54.697 --> 08:56.230
Got it.

09:06.509 --> 09:09.677
Whoa!
They're really good together.

09:09.679 --> 09:13.113
Smackdown for the scrapbook.

09:22.389 --> 09:24.257
Raaah!

09:47.981 --> 09:50.715
Thank you.

09:50.717 --> 09:52.417
Do you even know
what that does?

09:52.419 --> 09:55.820
It isn't a toy!

10:07.266 --> 10:08.300
Hey!

10:15.041 --> 10:16.342
Hey!

10:19.680 --> 10:22.682
What is going...

10:34.929 --> 10:37.865
What's this switch do?

10:49.578 --> 10:53.815
Hmph.
Megatron's gonna love this.

10:59.289 --> 11:01.057
Bulkhead!

11:03.295 --> 11:05.261
The 'cons are getting away!

11:05.263 --> 11:07.497
Hey! My phone!

11:07.499 --> 11:10.499
It's stuck!

11:10.501 --> 11:12.968
Where's Arcee?

11:12.970 --> 11:15.437
Why don't you
just marry her?

11:15.439 --> 11:18.005
I'm right behind you.

11:21.477 --> 11:23.911
Where?

11:23.913 --> 11:26.948
Let's just say
she's got your back.

11:26.950 --> 11:30.184
Uh, uh, uh...

11:37.727 --> 11:39.328
Scrap!

11:47.468 --> 11:49.736
Breakdown here.

11:49.738 --> 11:51.572
I'm gonna need a...

12:07.358 --> 12:10.159
You've been
magnetized...together?

12:10.161 --> 12:13.529
They're inseparable.

12:14.765 --> 12:17.399
And the device that did this
is on its way to Megatron.

12:17.401 --> 12:19.434
A polarity gauntlet...

12:19.436 --> 12:22.636
A deceptively simple
but diabolical creation.

12:22.638 --> 12:26.040
Just tell me you can
unhitch us, Ratchet.

12:26.042 --> 12:28.910
It may simply be
a residual magnetic charge

12:28.912 --> 12:31.379
providing your
current...attraction.

12:31.381 --> 12:34.383
They're not
attracted to each other!

12:34.385 --> 12:36.819
But I'm afraid retrieving
the gauntlet

12:36.821 --> 12:39.522
is our surest bet
for reversing its effect.

12:39.524 --> 12:42.425
Once Megatron gets
his hands on the gauntlet...

12:42.427 --> 12:44.160
He'll use it
for a whole lot more

12:44.162 --> 12:46.763
than attaching notes
and family photos to the fridge.

12:46.765 --> 12:48.764
Jack, I'm not following.

12:48.766 --> 12:52.335
Madam, we are forged
of metal alloy.

12:52.337 --> 12:55.671
If Megatron could repel us
with the flick of a switch,

12:55.673 --> 12:58.373
we might never again
have another shot at him.

12:58.375 --> 13:00.108
Instant force field.

13:00.110 --> 13:04.645
Worse yet, he might use it to
meld us all into a scrap pile.

13:04.647 --> 13:08.583
The good news is, the gauntlet
hasn't traveled far.

13:08.585 --> 13:11.886
I would strongly
advise pursuit.

13:11.888 --> 13:14.355
We can catch up faster
on wheels.

13:14.357 --> 13:15.624
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:15.626 --> 13:17.059
And snap me in half?

13:17.061 --> 13:18.627
Right.

13:18.629 --> 13:20.129
Sweet!

13:20.131 --> 13:21.397
I'll take point.

13:21.399 --> 13:22.899
Not this time, kid.

13:22.901 --> 13:24.233
What?
But you said...

13:24.235 --> 13:25.568
That was recon.

13:25.570 --> 13:27.137
This is war.

13:27.139 --> 13:28.805
I'm not risking
your well-being

13:28.807 --> 13:31.207
just so you can hit
your daily adrenaline quota.

13:31.209 --> 13:33.109
Ratchet, Miko needs a bridge.

13:33.111 --> 13:34.276
Coming up.

13:35.546 --> 13:39.181
You think Jack's mom is bad?
You sound just like her!

13:39.183 --> 13:40.715
Is that such a bad thing?

13:40.717 --> 13:43.750
Wh... uh...
I'm gonna go over here.

13:55.162 --> 13:56.696
It fits!

13:56.698 --> 13:59.732
You know, a girl can never have
too many accessories.

13:59.734 --> 14:01.133
You were a Decepticon once.

14:01.135 --> 14:03.469
We can bring the prize
to Megatron together.

14:03.471 --> 14:05.738
Go back to that boys club?

14:05.740 --> 14:09.107
I struck out on my own
because I don't like to share.

14:09.109 --> 14:12.009
This will provide
the perfect repellent

14:12.011 --> 14:15.012
against bots and 'cons alike.

14:24.321 --> 14:26.522
Never had eyes
in the back of my head before

14:26.524 --> 14:31.161
or blasters to cover my rear,
and you get a built-in shield.

14:31.163 --> 14:35.332
Bulkhead, you don't really think
I sound like June, do you?

14:35.334 --> 14:36.667
Um...

14:36.669 --> 14:38.335
She's over-protective.

14:38.337 --> 14:40.971
I'm just...Protective.

14:40.973 --> 14:41.972
Totally different.

14:43.976 --> 14:46.577
The gauntlet's close.

15:21.914 --> 15:25.216
I assume Arcee
isn't far behind.

15:25.218 --> 15:27.319
You might say that.

15:29.656 --> 15:32.691
Blaster hands in the air
and turn around.

15:32.693 --> 15:34.360
Whatever you say.

16:21.042 --> 16:23.211
Still up for a truce, muscles?

16:23.213 --> 16:26.381
Only because I hate Bulkhead
more than I hate you.

16:26.383 --> 16:28.683
Raaaah!

16:38.461 --> 16:40.028
What?

16:42.465 --> 16:45.233
Bulkhead, would you stay still?

16:45.235 --> 16:46.234
My bad.

16:48.771 --> 16:50.138
Whoa.

16:50.140 --> 16:51.273
Need a hand?

16:51.275 --> 16:54.643
No, she's mine.

16:54.645 --> 16:56.145
Two bots.

16:56.147 --> 16:57.914
One stone.

17:04.289 --> 17:05.790
Bulk, duck!

17:12.665 --> 17:16.032
Bulkhead, get...up!

17:16.035 --> 17:17.768
Pinned like a bug.

17:17.844 --> 17:19.678
Of course, I can think
of one permanent way

17:19.680 --> 17:21.781
out of your predicament.

17:27.651 --> 17:30.451
Of course, I can think
of one permanent way

17:30.546 --> 17:32.366
out of your predicament.

17:37.141 --> 17:38.974
I'll take topside.

17:46.818 --> 17:49.052
Hah!

17:49.054 --> 17:51.354
I'm free.

18:03.133 --> 18:05.301
Want to dance?

18:05.303 --> 18:07.770
You're not my type.

18:10.408 --> 18:12.142
Scrap!

18:14.378 --> 18:17.013
Let's leave the boys
to themselves.

18:20.784 --> 18:24.521
That would be the
"up close and personal" setting.

18:53.215 --> 18:56.384
One hand tied,
five more to play with.

18:57.486 --> 18:59.220
Quality, not quantity.

19:12.068 --> 19:13.969
Opposites do not attract.

19:16.539 --> 19:18.073
Raaah!

19:31.621 --> 19:33.622
We can't touch metal.

19:33.624 --> 19:35.624
We're polarized.

19:35.626 --> 19:37.727
Unh!

19:37.729 --> 19:40.563
Always leave on a high note.

19:44.335 --> 19:46.937
Bulkhead, the gauntlet!

20:08.362 --> 20:10.264
Let's finish this.

20:10.266 --> 20:12.500
And risk becoming twins again?

20:16.506 --> 20:18.874
Souvenir, but...

20:18.876 --> 20:20.843
We don't advise indoor use.

20:20.845 --> 20:23.947
Ew! They even finish
each other's sentences.

20:23.949 --> 20:25.515
Miko, check it out.

20:25.517 --> 20:26.816
New battle scars.

20:28.987 --> 20:30.420
Arcee! Hey!

20:30.422 --> 20:31.854
Let the adults talk.

20:31.856 --> 20:35.191
Arcee, I think I owe you an apology.
You do?

20:35.193 --> 20:38.928
I worry, especially when I feel
like I can't control things,

20:38.930 --> 20:41.798
which, with a teenager,
is all the time.

20:43.033 --> 20:45.468
Jack and I have
always been close,

20:45.470 --> 20:49.104
especially after his dad left,
and I guess it's just...

20:49.106 --> 20:51.974
Hard to accept
that all that's changing.

20:51.976 --> 20:53.576
I mean,
I knew it would someday,

20:53.578 --> 20:56.379
but you're not quite
the type of girl

20:56.381 --> 20:58.848
I thought Jack
would be ditching me for.

20:58.850 --> 21:01.618
I think we've all been
a little guilty

21:01.620 --> 21:04.688
of staying attached
to the way things were.

21:08.192 --> 21:12.562
Breakdown, you dare
to return empty-handed?!

21:12.564 --> 21:14.264
No, master.

21:17.401 --> 21:18.969
Airachnid.

21:18.971 --> 21:21.404
It has been some time.

21:21.406 --> 21:24.741
Lord Megatron, what can I say?

21:24.743 --> 21:28.511
It's good to be back.

21:29.305 --> 21:35.469
