02:27.590 --> 02:29.300
The troops are quartered.

02:29.383 --> 02:34.388
Burial preparations are underway
for those we were able to retrieve.

02:34.472 --> 02:39.017
I have ordered scouting parties to sweep
the grasslands a week's ride away

02:39.102 --> 02:40.686
in case Sidao is...

02:41.604 --> 02:44.482
audacious enough
to siege Cambulac.

02:47.068 --> 02:50.904
Finally, we are conscripting
new troops from the north.

02:50.988 --> 02:52.948
I have begun preparations for training.

02:53.031 --> 02:55.784
I fear they may be less compliant now,

02:55.868 --> 02:59.372
but we shall do what is necessary
to bend the willful.

03:03.292 --> 03:04.668
My Lord.

03:07.045 --> 03:08.672
Is that truly all?

03:11.967 --> 03:14.553
Do you not wish to discuss your counsel?

03:15.554 --> 03:17.598
And my disregard of it?

03:26.232 --> 03:29.735
The Polo matter,
are you prepared to proceed?

03:55.093 --> 03:57.138
Master Marco,

03:57.221 --> 03:59.807
in his infinite wisdom and compassion,

03:59.890 --> 04:05.521
the Khan of Khans grants you
a final audience to plead for mercy.

04:15.156 --> 04:17.575
I will not plead for mercy.

04:18.409 --> 04:20.244
But I will defend myself.

04:21.995 --> 04:25.291
May I seek clarity as to
the charges levied against me?

04:25.374 --> 04:26.750
Treason.

04:39.763 --> 04:41.849
I take no pleasure in this,
Master Marco.

04:41.932 --> 04:44.227
But it seems great misfortune

04:44.310 --> 04:47.062
has descended upon our kingdom
on your arrival.

04:47.145 --> 04:49.357
I did not choose to remain here.

04:49.440 --> 04:51.317
I chose to be released to my father.

04:51.400 --> 04:53.611
Your time in the Kochkor region.

04:53.694 --> 04:56.780
Your ability to enter and leave
without repercussion.

04:56.864 --> 04:59.074
And do you suspect Byamba,
son of the Khan,

04:59.157 --> 05:00.868
to have blood on his hands?

05:00.951 --> 05:03.161
We traveled side by side.

05:04.705 --> 05:06.290
Is that accurate, Byamba?

05:06.374 --> 05:08.917
Were you always at the Latin's side
on your journey?

05:09.001 --> 05:11.670
I was asked to be here and I came.

05:11.754 --> 05:14.340
But you cannot compel me
to be party to this.

05:20.053 --> 05:23.474
No, we were not side by side.

05:25.434 --> 05:28.103
There was a point where
he was negotiating for my life

05:28.186 --> 05:31.482
while I sat captive,
preparing to die.

05:32.608 --> 05:36.279
And if I remember,
you sent the Latin with me on my journey.

05:36.362 --> 05:38.364
After he convinced me to do so.

05:38.447 --> 05:40.949
How does your body
stand straight without a spine?

05:41.033 --> 05:43.035
Xiangyang.

05:44.787 --> 05:46.121
The loss.

05:46.204 --> 05:48.206
Your journey there.

05:48.291 --> 05:50.167
Your time with the whore's whore-friend.

05:52.002 --> 05:54.254
Sanctioned by the Khan of Khans.

05:54.338 --> 05:55.964
You alerted the Song
to our pending attack.

05:56.048 --> 05:58.467
You conspired to lead us
into the slaughter.

05:58.551 --> 06:01.261
What need would they of warning?

06:02.805 --> 06:05.766
They knew we were descending
at a week's distance.

06:07.351 --> 06:09.312
As to the wall...

06:09.395 --> 06:10.896
I am guilty.

06:13.190 --> 06:17.235
I founder in the blood of the thousands
who perished for my error.

06:18.404 --> 06:20.448
I have no defense.

06:24.159 --> 06:29.915
But right or wrong, I have done nothing
but serve my captor and Khan.

06:32.167 --> 06:33.461
And only him?

06:37.381 --> 06:38.632
Yes.

06:43.971 --> 06:45.473
Is that all?

06:46.515 --> 06:50.519
Nothing you have presented is punishable
by the laws of the Khan of Khans.

06:53.647 --> 06:55.441
I had this translated.

06:59.612 --> 07:01.530
Would you care to share with the Khan

07:01.614 --> 07:04.992
the words that you keep
so closely to your still-beating heart?

07:07.828 --> 07:10.831
"All kings shall fall before him."

07:12.249 --> 07:16.504
"All kings... shall fall before him."

07:16.587 --> 07:17.921
It was a gift.

07:18.005 --> 07:19.507
From father to son?

07:19.590 --> 07:21.133
Yes.

07:21.216 --> 07:26.221
A verse from the scriptures of a religion
welcomed, like all the others,

07:26.304 --> 07:28.015
within the walls of Cambulac.

07:28.098 --> 07:30.351
A faith with designs on our kingdom.

07:30.434 --> 07:32.395
I know nothing of that.

07:34.146 --> 07:37.190
But I do believe
you have designs on the Vatican.

07:37.274 --> 07:38.609
What of it?

07:40.361 --> 07:43.447
Respectfully, Lord Khan...

07:43.531 --> 07:45.157
we reap what we sow.

07:45.240 --> 07:46.742
You speak recklessly.

07:46.825 --> 07:48.452
I speak honestly.

07:49.453 --> 07:52.498
You deserve honesty.

07:52.581 --> 07:56.209
You believe I should not conquer the West?

07:57.503 --> 08:00.423
On the contrary, Lord Khan.

08:01.965 --> 08:05.386
The most common law
of nature and of man...

08:06.512 --> 08:10.265
is to take what has been mandated

08:10.348 --> 08:11.809
by God

08:11.892 --> 08:14.812
or by the swords and arrows you command.

08:15.813 --> 08:17.981
You claim both.

08:18.065 --> 08:21.860
But you must be prepared
for the resistance of the lionhearted.

08:22.778 --> 08:25.280
And the West is not weak.

08:38.335 --> 08:41.922
Have you nothing more to say
to champion your cause?

08:43.631 --> 08:48.095
It seems my end is guaranteed
no matter what words I sound.

08:49.346 --> 08:50.639
Indeed.

08:54.727 --> 08:55.769
Mmm.

10:02.127 --> 10:05.130
The Imperial Seal is yours, Chancellor.

10:05.213 --> 10:07.465
And with it, the dynasty.

10:09.552 --> 10:12.470
Chancellor... even still?

10:12.555 --> 10:15.015
Unless your birthright has altered.

10:18.393 --> 10:20.312
The Seven Families are arriving.

10:20.395 --> 10:23.899
Songs of your victory
have carried far and wide.

10:23.982 --> 10:28.153
How you eviscerated the Mongol horde,
body and soul.

10:29.738 --> 10:33.325
They are prepared
to pledge their fealty to the Emperor.

10:35.536 --> 10:37.746
They're going to want to see the boy.

10:38.831 --> 10:40.916
That is assured.

10:40.999 --> 10:44.294
No one truly believes
the boy guides his own hand.

10:45.879 --> 10:48.173
Yet the sheep elevate him.

10:50.425 --> 10:52.344
I must stand behind him.

10:52.427 --> 10:54.179
A wise tactic, my Chancellor.

10:56.974 --> 11:00.477
I suppose I couldn't simply
imprint this on his skull

11:00.561 --> 11:02.270
and float him down the Yangtze?

11:07.818 --> 11:09.486
Tell me your name.

11:10.445 --> 11:12.197
You need not fear me.

11:12.280 --> 11:15.200
It is Judar, my Princess.

11:16.576 --> 11:18.203
You may call me Kokachin.

11:19.329 --> 11:20.831
No, Princess.

11:20.914 --> 11:22.040
Do you defy me?

11:23.500 --> 11:25.460
In this, I do.

11:26.419 --> 11:29.089
If you defy this simple request,

11:29.172 --> 11:31.800
how am I to know
you will not defy a greater one?

11:31.884 --> 11:35.470
The truest of servants
knows our needs better than we do.

11:35.553 --> 11:37.097
Leave us.

11:40.893 --> 11:44.396
I was your age
when I was promised to Kublai.

11:44.479 --> 11:46.398
It was terrifying.

11:46.481 --> 11:50.903
I knew he would be Khan
even if he himself did not.

11:52.279 --> 11:56.241
At the time...
I felt as if I was unworthy,

11:56.324 --> 11:58.576
that a mistake had surely been made

11:58.661 --> 12:02.247
and at a moment's notice
someone would unveil me as a fraud.

12:05.709 --> 12:09.046
It was not until Kublai's mother
gifted me this,

12:09.129 --> 12:13.258
the finest of silks, to be woven
into my presentational gown,

12:13.341 --> 12:15.510
that I knew it was true.

12:15.593 --> 12:19.973
I kept what remained
to one day gift to a daughter of my own.

12:26.396 --> 12:28.148
It is lovely.

12:28.231 --> 12:31.735
A mere reflection of the beauty
who wears it.

12:34.612 --> 12:40.118
I also come to pay condolences
and to inquire as to your heart.

12:42.746 --> 12:44.539
I lost a good friend.

12:44.622 --> 12:48.126
Your only friend, if I recall.

12:49.795 --> 12:52.297
I hope it's no longer the case,
my Queen.

12:53.716 --> 12:55.342
If you speak of me...

12:56.969 --> 12:58.846
speak with certainty.

13:03.976 --> 13:07.896
I'm afraid loss has infected
the kingdom of late.

13:09.147 --> 13:11.524
With more on the horizon.

13:13.568 --> 13:15.612
So I've heard.

13:15.695 --> 13:17.740
You've heard?

13:19.992 --> 13:22.702
The Latin is to be executed.

13:28.208 --> 13:29.376
At dawn.

13:30.543 --> 13:33.630
A seamstress will pay you a visit shortly.

13:40.345 --> 13:42.305
Master Polo.

13:42.389 --> 13:45.183
I came to inquire
as to your state of mind.

13:46.935 --> 13:49.855
My thanks for your concern, Jingim.

13:49.938 --> 13:51.148
Prince.

13:52.232 --> 13:54.109
Prince Jingim.

13:58.655 --> 14:00.824
I know this seems unjust,

14:00.908 --> 14:03.952
and it's hard for you to see,
sitting where you are.

14:05.328 --> 14:10.417
But understand... that this is entirely
for the good of the kingdom.

14:15.172 --> 14:16.589
Do you hunt?

14:19.092 --> 14:24.264
In our culture, your first hunt,
as in many things in life,

14:24.347 --> 14:26.724
is a very lonely enterprise.

14:28.351 --> 14:32.689
You're cast into the wilderness
with nothing more than a bow and an arrow

14:32.773 --> 14:35.608
and instructed not to return without meat.

14:36.944 --> 14:38.403
For the kingdom.

14:39.404 --> 14:42.657
It can take a day, a week.

14:43.741 --> 14:45.786
Some never return.

14:51.208 --> 14:55.462
What do you think is the most vital trait
for the hunter to possess?

14:55.545 --> 14:59.132
Please, Jingim,
do not mar my final hours.

15:01.634 --> 15:03.053
Patience.

15:06.932 --> 15:09.642
I saw its horns first.

15:09.726 --> 15:14.231
Grand, stretching to the heavens
and catching the morning light.

15:15.232 --> 15:16.942
A mighty trophy.

15:19.027 --> 15:22.447
I set my arrow, took aim.

15:24.074 --> 15:25.242
He was gone.

15:29.329 --> 15:31.623
But I had a feeling about him...

15:32.582 --> 15:34.835
and so I waited another night.

15:35.878 --> 15:39.797
It was so cold,
I wanted to run home.

15:39.882 --> 15:43.426
A handful of kills passed me by.

15:43.510 --> 15:47.305
I could have slain them all,
returned triumphant,

15:47.389 --> 15:50.058
dipped my finger in the fat of the kill,

15:50.142 --> 15:53.311
been deemed a man
and slept in my own bed.

15:56.398 --> 15:58.108
But I waited.

16:01.945 --> 16:05.032
As I felt the sun warm me
the next morning...

16:07.492 --> 16:11.329
there it was,
passing between the trees.

16:16.293 --> 16:18.378
My father was so proud.

16:39.024 --> 16:40.483
Patience.

16:42.485 --> 16:45.989
Patience to ensure that
true aim finds the true target.

16:47.615 --> 16:49.617
An innocent target,

16:49.701 --> 16:53.746
whose offense was crossing paths
at the wrong time,

16:55.040 --> 16:56.583
with the wrong person.

17:14.892 --> 17:16.019
Death.

17:17.520 --> 17:19.231
Another lonely enterprise.

17:22.067 --> 17:25.153
May your God accompany you,
Master Polo.

17:31.118 --> 17:33.120
You will need it more than I.

17:42.087 --> 17:45.215
Let us not build strife
where none should exist.

17:45.298 --> 17:47.759
Pride and hope have filled
the coffers of the people's spirits.

17:47.842 --> 17:50.928
Those coffers were never depleted.

17:51.013 --> 17:54.975
You simply convinced yourself otherwise
to support your own machinations.

17:55.058 --> 17:56.518
Why am I your enemy

17:56.601 --> 18:00.981
when you're the one prepared to bury
our culture in history's potter's field?

18:01.064 --> 18:03.816
The landed gentry of the south
prepare to meet.

18:03.900 --> 18:06.694
Are these the same landed gentry
whose land you stripped

18:06.778 --> 18:08.946
against my husband's wishes
not long ago?

18:09.031 --> 18:12.659
The proceeds from the fields
helped fund our defenses.

18:12.742 --> 18:15.828
And each now pledges their support
for an assault on Cambulac.

18:15.912 --> 18:18.999
My compliments, Jia Sidao.

18:19.082 --> 18:20.500
Insincerity still.

18:20.583 --> 18:22.794
I am nothing but sincere.

18:22.877 --> 18:27.924
You set out to undermine the council
and retain the chancellorate.

18:28.008 --> 18:29.259
Fang Zhen fell.

18:30.593 --> 18:32.929
You sought to repel the Mongol horde

18:33.013 --> 18:37.392
and masterfully lured them into
a hornet's nest of sharpened steel.

18:37.475 --> 18:42.397
You wish to gather Southern China
into one indomitable force

18:42.480 --> 18:45.442
and gird them for the final unification.

18:45.525 --> 18:48.361
I have no doubt
you will succeed in that as well.

18:48.445 --> 18:53.075
But you will do so without the support
you are about to ask of me.

18:53.158 --> 18:55.827
How might I convince you
of the folly of your decision?

18:55.910 --> 18:57.704
Stop tinkering with that
and look at me.

19:02.417 --> 19:04.919
There is nothing
you might say or do.

19:05.002 --> 19:06.213
Ever.

19:08.173 --> 19:10.675
I assumed that
would be your answer.

19:10.758 --> 19:11.801
Very well.

19:11.884 --> 19:15.555
I shall go it alone. Yet again.

19:15.638 --> 19:19.684
You need the Emperor
in order to accomplish your final design.

19:19.767 --> 19:22.979
You cannot lock me
away from him forever.

19:23.063 --> 19:24.522
My dear Empress...

19:25.732 --> 19:27.734
I never considered that an option.

19:57.805 --> 20:00.475
You're here to defend him?

20:00.558 --> 20:04.521
Lord Khan, years ago,
you took my eyes.

20:04.604 --> 20:08.691
Today... I offer you the rest of me.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.818
What do you speak of?

20:10.902 --> 20:14.572
If the boy is culpable as you say,

20:14.656 --> 20:19.369
and I have no reason to doubt
the Khan's good judgment on such matters,

20:19.452 --> 20:22.372
then I am equally culpable.

20:22.455 --> 20:24.999
You entrusted the Latin to me.

20:25.082 --> 20:28.253
I trained him, fought beside him.

20:28.336 --> 20:30.672
How can you not
believe me complicit?

20:30.755 --> 20:32.174
- Get out!
- Lord Khan...

20:32.257 --> 20:35.885
Guards!
Escort the monk out of my sight.

20:35.968 --> 20:38.471
Do not allow him to return.

21:01.953 --> 21:04.121
- Where do you intend to go?
- The Ministry of Justice.

21:04.206 --> 21:06.249
- For what purpose?
- None of your concern.

21:08.876 --> 21:11.588
My apologies,
but you may not leave, Princess.

21:11.671 --> 21:13.256
Pardon me?

21:13.340 --> 21:14.799
I cannot allow you to leave.

21:14.882 --> 21:16.176
You're my servant.

21:16.259 --> 21:18.428
As well as your defender.

21:19.679 --> 21:21.055
Whom do you take orders from?

21:21.138 --> 21:24.559
The Blue Princess commands me
as dictated by the Great Khan.

21:24.642 --> 21:27.437
You had best remember that.

21:27.520 --> 21:28.855
Stand aside!

21:36.946 --> 21:40.950
Empress Chabi has instructed
that you remain in your quarters.

21:42.869 --> 21:45.913
- Until?
- We receive further orders.

22:15.777 --> 22:16.903
Hello, Ling Ling.

22:20.282 --> 22:25.745
I appreciate your regard, child,
but sit with me.

22:31.668 --> 22:34.170
You're beyond your years
in grace and training.

22:35.380 --> 22:39.258
Regrettably, that is found
far too infrequently in children your age.

22:39.342 --> 22:42.304
My thanks, My Lady.

22:42.387 --> 22:43.888
When I was a young girl,

22:43.971 --> 22:48.225
my mother told me it was as if
I had been raised by wild yaks,

22:48.310 --> 22:51.020
spitting and kicking
everyone around me.

22:54.524 --> 22:56.150
How are you feeling?

22:57.819 --> 23:00.322
My feet hurt less, My Lady.

23:01.280 --> 23:03.157
Good news.

23:04.409 --> 23:06.494
How are you finding
your time in Cambulac?

23:06.578 --> 23:08.580
I enjoy it greatly.

23:10.790 --> 23:13.626
You miss your home? Your family?

23:17.672 --> 23:19.090
Tell me of your mother.

23:20.508 --> 23:24.136
To have a daughter such as yourself,
she must be lovely.

23:25.137 --> 23:27.724
She is. She's a dancer.

23:30.685 --> 23:31.894
A dancer?

23:32.895 --> 23:34.814
Does she dance for you?

23:34.897 --> 23:36.399
For my father.

23:37.817 --> 23:40.945
I am quite sure he enjoys that.

23:41.028 --> 23:43.656
She was his favorite.

23:47.076 --> 23:48.370
His favorite?

23:51.664 --> 23:54.584
Did your father
have many dancers?

24:04.511 --> 24:06.220
Does your father still live?

24:11.893 --> 24:15.397
Did your father sit on a throne?

24:18.816 --> 24:20.443
We own Chinese royalty?

24:21.235 --> 24:25.197
That's more precious than anything
that surrounds us in this moment.

24:25.281 --> 24:27.283
The question is,
how best to use it?

24:27.366 --> 24:29.786
We own nothing.

24:29.869 --> 24:33.330
The daughter rightfully does not trust me.
The mother less so.

24:33.415 --> 24:36.418
Her mother's like a wounded animal,
desperate for kindness.

24:36.501 --> 24:40.880
One which will lick your hand
simply to get a taste before biting.

24:40.963 --> 24:43.633
Some men pay good coin
for such pleasures.

24:45.134 --> 24:48.137
I wonder sometimes
about that mind of yours.

24:48.220 --> 24:50.807
Clear in intent, Lady Empress.

24:51.808 --> 24:54.268
Then be intent on this matter.

24:54.894 --> 25:00.024
To tame an animal,
it must fear the raising of your hand.

25:00.107 --> 25:02.193
I may be just ahead of you
at this moment.

25:04.361 --> 25:05.572
How so?

25:05.655 --> 25:07.907
I planted a seed in the mother's head

25:07.990 --> 25:10.201
that her daughter is...

25:10.284 --> 25:13.245
closer than she first envisioned.

25:13.329 --> 25:15.665
I imagine it may have
sprouted as a weed.

25:15.748 --> 25:16.874
Hmm.

25:30.346 --> 25:32.932
I value your friendship, Sifu.

25:33.975 --> 25:38.104
As I have stated time and again,
I am not your friend.

25:38.187 --> 25:40.147
Far from it.

25:40.231 --> 25:42.734
I know you wish to believe that,

25:42.817 --> 25:47.071
but you cared for me,
taught me, protected me.

25:48.197 --> 25:50.950
What would you call that,
if not friendship?

25:51.033 --> 25:52.827
An onerous burden.

25:54.704 --> 25:57.582
In few hours' time,
that burden will be lifted.

25:58.916 --> 26:01.878
And I will have lost a friend.

26:01.961 --> 26:03.880
Is there no escape?

26:03.963 --> 26:06.048
From you leaving this mortal body?

26:07.174 --> 26:08.467
Yes.

26:08.551 --> 26:09.927
None.

26:10.011 --> 26:12.263
Unless you can find
something to gift to him

26:12.346 --> 26:15.057
that is more valuable than your life.

26:49.842 --> 26:51.010
Why?

26:51.093 --> 26:53.345
She missed your father so much.

26:53.429 --> 26:58.601
Sometimes, hearts are broken
and they cannot be pieced together again.

26:58.685 --> 27:00.770
Will mine break?

27:00.853 --> 27:03.856
No... because you do not need her.

27:04.732 --> 27:09.236
You do not need me or anyone.
You need only this.

27:17.036 --> 27:18.204
What do you see?

27:19.581 --> 27:20.790
A bug.

27:20.873 --> 27:24.210
You're most correct,
but it is so much more.

27:24.293 --> 27:26.295
This mantis that I give to you

27:27.129 --> 27:30.842
was one of 300 nymphs, babies...

27:30.925 --> 27:32.134
about this big.

27:32.844 --> 27:35.054
Imagine that, 300.

27:35.137 --> 27:38.057
The strongest among them
kill the weakest among them

27:38.725 --> 27:40.559
until the very best are left.

27:40.643 --> 27:42.061
A mere handful.

27:43.062 --> 27:47.191
Now, this mantis will leave this life
within 10 months of today.

27:49.401 --> 27:53.197
You must take this time as an opportunity
to learn everything you can.

27:53.280 --> 27:55.491
To study, to practice,

27:55.574 --> 27:58.535
to absorb all the lessons of the mantis,

27:58.620 --> 27:59.704
for there are many.

27:59.787 --> 28:04.583
Patience, speed,
adaptability, ruthlessness.

28:05.292 --> 28:07.419
The traits of a warrior king.

28:08.545 --> 28:10.214
Heed my words, my Emperor...

28:11.423 --> 28:13.843
and you will become as the mantis.

28:30.902 --> 28:32.111
Judar?

28:33.195 --> 28:34.656
Yes, Princess?

28:36.866 --> 28:40.161
Fetch me some sandalwood
for my bath.

28:40.244 --> 28:42.079
Yes, Princess.

29:31.671 --> 29:33.089
What are your thoughts?

29:35.091 --> 29:36.884
I do not know.

29:42.014 --> 29:43.390
Is it my doing?

29:44.684 --> 29:46.435
Are you frustrated with me?

29:46.518 --> 29:49.355
No. No, never.

29:53.525 --> 29:55.152
I need you here.

30:00.783 --> 30:01.868
I am.

30:07.289 --> 30:09.375
Why am I not relieved?

30:12.586 --> 30:17.424
You are sensitive to the grief of others,
no matter their transgressions.

30:18.843 --> 30:22.138
Every breath the Latin takes
is a burden on your soul.

30:23.890 --> 30:28.644
At sun's light... you will find relief.

30:43.993 --> 30:46.537
Did I introduce a curse
into our bed?

30:50.332 --> 30:52.919
You are the son of a Khan...

30:54.420 --> 30:56.923
a Khan in waiting.

30:59.216 --> 31:02.678
The fault rests with me
and me alone.

31:25.367 --> 31:28.162
Do not make your presence known.

31:31.123 --> 31:35.127
I wanted you to see that she lives.
As you wished.

31:36.295 --> 31:38.339
She will always be here,

31:38.422 --> 31:41.801
under my watchful eye,
under my tutelage.

31:42.844 --> 31:45.096
I will care for her as my own.

31:51.602 --> 31:54.897
Look at her, remember her.

31:56.107 --> 31:57.483
You will never see her again.

31:59.526 --> 32:02.864
But if you do what I say,
when I say it,

32:02.947 --> 32:07.743
you can be secure in the knowledge that
her days will stretch long before her.

32:18.587 --> 32:19.839
Come now.

32:44.696 --> 32:47.116
What is the benefit
of being a princess

32:47.199 --> 32:50.494
if your lord requires you
to perform your own labor?

32:50.577 --> 32:53.455
We will do the same
to our children one day.

32:54.456 --> 32:56.042
Where are your belongings?

32:56.876 --> 33:01.463
I looked for what I should pack
and realized everything I need is here.

33:03.465 --> 33:05.885
In a week's time, we will be home.

33:08.804 --> 33:11.182
Is this as foreign to you
as it is to me?

33:11.265 --> 33:12.558
More so.

33:13.809 --> 33:16.062
Do you think we will ever settle into it?

33:16.145 --> 33:17.813
I hope not.

33:42.379 --> 33:43.797
Minister.

33:57.937 --> 34:00.606
Is this what you
summoned me down here for?

34:00.689 --> 34:02.774
You oversee war.

34:04.193 --> 34:06.988
And I am going to tell you how to win it.

34:09.822 --> 34:11.617
Thank you for coming.

34:12.826 --> 34:15.786
Do you think I would deny
a dying man an audience?

34:15.871 --> 34:17.623
I know nothing of you.

34:17.706 --> 34:20.876
In this, you are at a decided advantage.

34:22.628 --> 34:23.629
Your journal.

34:25.005 --> 34:26.672
It is most enlightening

34:26.757 --> 34:30.969
when one has unfettered access
inside a person's thoughts.

34:32.429 --> 34:34.723
Warrantless access.

34:34.806 --> 34:37.101
To be fair, you were an enigma.

34:38.101 --> 34:39.978
One that had grown close to my Khan.

34:40.062 --> 34:43.983
You could have sat with me
prior to my last night of life...

34:44.065 --> 34:45.234
and asked.

34:46.818 --> 34:51.114
I am certain you would not have granted me
the insight I required.

34:53.324 --> 34:54.326
But...

34:55.536 --> 34:56.745
I procured the journal

34:56.828 --> 34:59.665
prior to your writing of one curiosity.

35:00.666 --> 35:03.544
What made you cease
your attempts at escape?

35:05.129 --> 35:06.463
Was it her?

35:11.968 --> 35:16.348
Under the circumstances,
you need not hold your tongue.

35:21.853 --> 35:23.230
Partially.

35:24.898 --> 35:26.525
Significantly.

35:28.152 --> 35:30.154
But not entirely.

35:38.954 --> 35:40.081
Tell me.

35:47.629 --> 35:50.049
The walled Phoenician city of Tyre.

35:51.300 --> 35:54.053
It defied Alexander for 13 long years.

35:56.180 --> 35:59.308
Built on an island,
Tyre was walled to the sea,

35:59.391 --> 36:02.978
an insurmountable fortress
that was key to all of Persia.

36:03.062 --> 36:06.732
He attempted to breach the walls
using common instruments of war,

36:06.815 --> 36:10.819
arrows, battering rams, catapults.

36:10.902 --> 36:15.282
But three dozen men
are needed to load and fire one.

36:17.368 --> 36:22.331
Alexander employed... the trebuchet,

36:22.414 --> 36:27.378
a siege engine powered not by men
but by a counterweight.

36:28.129 --> 36:31.715
Imagine the weight of
6,000 pounds on one end

36:31.798 --> 36:34.385
and a 300-pound rock set on the other.

36:35.802 --> 36:39.390
Imagine firing 1,000 in a single day.

36:44.895 --> 36:50.401
Imagine what even three of these engines
could do to the walls of Xiangyang.

36:51.485 --> 36:55.822
And at a distance that keeps
the army safe from archers.

36:55.906 --> 36:57.158
Correct.

37:01.578 --> 37:03.455
Altruism still?

37:04.456 --> 37:07.709
Even in the face of your execution?

37:07.793 --> 37:09.170
Not purely.

37:10.796 --> 37:12.589
I'm not afraid to die...

37:13.799 --> 37:18.011
but I'm terrified to do so
while branded a traitor.

37:24.768 --> 37:27.396
What is the entirety you spoke of earlier?

37:28.814 --> 37:30.607
What else made you stay?

37:34.945 --> 37:39.283
The moment the Khan gave me the choice
to deliver my father from death.

37:40.784 --> 37:43.204
He is a good man.

38:02.181 --> 38:05.726
Grandfather, why couldn't
you have taken that?

38:05.809 --> 38:09.020
Why couldn't you have taken that wall?

38:33.086 --> 38:37.173
My Emperor, these men
are all that remain of the Red Lotus.

38:37.258 --> 38:40.386
Traitors within the kingdom determined
to undermine the Emperor's mission,

38:41.011 --> 38:44.180
determined to destroy
the Emperor and his dynasty.

38:44.265 --> 38:47.268
They are your enemy.

38:47.351 --> 38:49.895
They are weak.
They must be punished.

38:51.855 --> 38:55.609
What does the strong mantis do
to its weaker brothers and sisters?

38:59.112 --> 39:00.614
Kill them.

39:01.323 --> 39:02.449
Hmm.

39:08.955 --> 39:10.332
A catapult?

39:11.333 --> 39:12.793
Waste of my time.

39:13.794 --> 39:17.589
Lord Khan, with respect,
this may very well be the key...

39:17.673 --> 39:20.509
The key to Xiangyang, finally!

39:21.552 --> 39:25.847
If only my Vice Regent
had attained this key years ago!

39:25.931 --> 39:27.558
Some magical solution?

39:27.641 --> 39:31.520
Why did you bring this to me
when I know you crave my failure?

39:31.603 --> 39:33.814
If that is what you believe,

39:33.897 --> 39:35.857
then you have not
been listening to anything...

39:35.941 --> 39:38.569
Enough of your insolence!

39:40.195 --> 39:41.447
You...

39:43.156 --> 39:46.242
beg for my pardon,
is that your scheme?

39:47.286 --> 39:51.039
No, Sire.
Begging is for the guilty.

39:57.754 --> 40:01.925
I've seen stronger men than you
weep before the rug.

40:03.469 --> 40:07.222
When the time comes,
be brave and sure.

40:08.849 --> 40:11.101
For it is coming at dawn...

40:12.436 --> 40:14.688
no matter how loud you cry.

40:16.357 --> 40:18.359
Lord Khan...

43:02.731 --> 43:03.815
Liar!

43:03.899 --> 43:05.025
You're a liar!

43:06.109 --> 43:09.571
Remove yourself.
We speak of this lunacy no more.

43:09.655 --> 43:11.156
Tell the kheshig to jail me.

43:11.239 --> 43:15.285
You made your point, take your leave.
There is honest work to be done.

43:15.368 --> 43:18.038
This is merely a statement of facts.

43:18.121 --> 43:20.331
Oh! You hired the assassins?

43:20.874 --> 43:23.084
You manipulated that whore, Mei Lin.

43:23.168 --> 43:27.005
You instructed my brother
to withhold his troops from Wuchang?

43:27.088 --> 43:28.632
You conspired with Jia Sidao?

43:28.715 --> 43:31.009
I conspired for and with the Khanate.

43:31.092 --> 43:34.680
And you think, what?
The Khanate does not guide my heart?

43:34.763 --> 43:36.222
Your mind.

43:36.890 --> 43:39.768
But minds can be easily
persuaded of anything.

43:39.851 --> 43:44.022
The reason you do not sleep
is because of a longing in your heart

43:44.105 --> 43:46.900
- that will never be sated.
- And why should it?

43:47.609 --> 43:50.696
- I know you believe Xiangyang will fall.
- It will.

43:50.779 --> 43:55.450
And you fear that once conquered,
I turn my aims to lands far reaching?

43:55.534 --> 43:57.077
- I do.
- Why should I not?

43:57.160 --> 43:59.996
Because you know how this will end.

44:01.247 --> 44:03.374
As all other dynasties have.

44:04.626 --> 44:06.587
Am I not different?

44:07.671 --> 44:09.505
I once believed so.

44:09.590 --> 44:11.925
It is why I stand before you this evening.

44:12.008 --> 44:14.135
Yusuf, you did not do this.

44:15.053 --> 44:17.138
My confession stands.

44:17.222 --> 44:22.352
Be it betrayal by my hands
or by my heart,

44:22.435 --> 44:24.062
I am guilty.

44:25.188 --> 44:26.565
What do you want from me?

44:28.108 --> 44:30.151
To give up Xiangyang?

44:30.235 --> 44:33.029
- You know the answer is yes.
- I cannot.

44:33.113 --> 44:34.823
I know that as well.

44:36.116 --> 44:38.368
I should hide behind my wall?

44:38.451 --> 44:41.246
Take pleasure in the present state?

44:41.329 --> 44:44.332
While away my days
and bury myself here when they're done?

44:44.415 --> 44:47.669
Where is the fault in that? Hmm?

44:47.753 --> 44:50.046
How many lands must be reaped?

44:50.672 --> 44:56.052
How many vaults must be filled
and young spirits extinguished?

45:02.684 --> 45:04.895
One. One last game.

45:12.527 --> 45:14.362
Taken the pieces away.

45:33.882 --> 45:35.717
The boy is guilty.

45:38.679 --> 45:41.890
His only guilt
is his blind desire for your love.

45:52.943 --> 45:55.821
You know who he reminds me of?

45:56.947 --> 46:01.201
Yusuf... my crazed cripple of Khazaria.

46:03.494 --> 46:05.831
Not in mindless bloodletting...

46:07.123 --> 46:09.500
but in dedication to your cause.

46:12.128 --> 46:13.588
He does.

46:14.672 --> 46:18.093
You need that dedication
at your service

46:18.176 --> 46:20.136
at all times.

46:23.348 --> 46:27.936
I am no longer capable of it,
nor am I willing.

46:32.190 --> 46:36.444
You have the finest engineers
in all the world.

46:36.527 --> 46:39.906
My final counsel to you
is that you put them to work.

46:41.199 --> 46:43.952
Construct the Latin's siege engine.

46:56.214 --> 47:00.385
As your Khan,
I do not accept your confession.

47:07.433 --> 47:12.438
I have sent messages to every corner of
the kingdom outlining my complicity.

47:13.689 --> 47:18.444
In doing so, I have weakened your position
before Karakorum and throughout China.

47:19.612 --> 47:22.323
You will be challenged in the Kurultai.

47:22.407 --> 47:23.992
You will lose.

47:25.493 --> 47:26.953
And in that...

47:27.037 --> 47:30.248
a dream of this place may endure.

47:33.794 --> 47:36.254
You have no choice, Kublai.

48:35.146 --> 48:37.690
I thought I had until dawn.

48:49.702 --> 48:51.704
The final battle looms.

48:52.705 --> 48:54.875
Be decisive in your victory.

49:05.260 --> 49:07.595
You are released from this prison.

49:10.306 --> 49:12.142
But I am truly free.
