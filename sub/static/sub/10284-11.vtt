00:03.714 --> 00:05.136
Previously on E.R.

00:05.147 --> 00:07.682
You should come to my Bible group
sometime. I think you'd really like it.

00:07.693 --> 00:09.502
Bible group? Okay.

00:09.507 --> 00:11.430
Do you think I'm gonna
hang out waiting for you

00:11.434 --> 00:13.233
to find out that he's just
jerking you around?

00:13.243 --> 00:16.433
You're making me think about
the way I want my life to be.

00:16.592 --> 00:18.186
This is Ben Parker; he's a new R.N.

00:18.193 --> 00:19.487
Let me buy you a drink
or take you out to dinner.

00:19.493 --> 00:20.363
Like a date?

00:20.375 --> 00:22.960
When I was a paramedic, we used
to run homeless kids like this.

00:22.974 --> 00:26.423
- Please just help Paulie.
- I can't. Paulie's very sick.

00:26.437 --> 00:28.453
I know your secret name.
Mayday.

00:28.464 --> 00:31.112
There's a crazy, angry guy following us?

00:31.969 --> 00:33.181
Listen to me, Ames.

00:33.376 --> 00:37.152
Come near my family again,
I'll kill you.

00:47.218 --> 00:48.860
It was kind of fun...

00:49.195 --> 00:51.521
till the chemo kid called me
"Rudolph's skank."

00:51.536 --> 00:53.660
One of them asked me if you were Sleepy or Sneezy.

00:54.145 --> 00:57.532
What?
I'm an elf, I'm not a freakin' dwarf.

00:57.996 --> 01:01.131
- Oh, my God.
- Nice antlers.

01:01.148 --> 01:03.642
You guys look so cute.
I got to get my camera.

01:03.657 --> 01:04.930
No, that's okay, really.

01:04.944 --> 01:07.283
- Well, was it fun at least?
- Pedes was a war zone.

01:07.296 --> 01:09.342
- Heard you lost the pool. Sorry.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:09.346 --> 01:11.200
I gotta say, that's one hot
lookin' dwarf you got with you.

01:11.208 --> 01:13.440
You know what?
I'm an elf, damn it.

01:14.615 --> 01:17.221
As we commemorate the birth of Jesus,
I find myself

01:17.238 --> 01:19.710
contemplating the vices
I have been guilty of.

01:19.838 --> 01:22.440
And also the virtues that

01:22.806 --> 01:27.413
I that all of us born in sin and striving
for sanctity-- should aspire to.

01:27.426 --> 01:33.450
Turning our pride to humility,
our envy to compassion...

01:35.237 --> 01:38.081
Our anger to mercy?

01:39.506 --> 01:42.812
Our laziness to activity.

01:44.016 --> 01:46.773
Our greed to generosity.

01:47.465 --> 01:51.650
Our gluttony to moderation.

01:53.337 --> 01:58.570
And last but not least,
our lust must be turned to...?

01:59.625 --> 02:00.851
Archie?

02:03.348 --> 02:06.640
Um... consummation?

02:10.497 --> 02:12.021
Yeah, no, no, seriously.

02:12.115 --> 02:17.652
Um, our lust must be turned to...
purity?

02:18.557 --> 02:23.661
Uh, well, I was looking for "chastity,"
but talk about purity a little.

02:25.088 --> 02:26.452
Well, you know, I've...

02:26.748 --> 02:30.151
I've always taken it
to mean purity of spirit

02:30.306 --> 02:32.790
as opposed to a literal, corporal purity.

02:33.927 --> 02:35.251
Mm-hmm, go on.

02:36.108 --> 02:39.821
Uh... well, you know,
we all live in the modern world,

02:39.877 --> 02:43.961
right?
And our virtuousness shouldn't be

02:44.358 --> 02:47.823
locked into some antiquated
notion of abstinence.

02:48.567 --> 02:49.801
Should it?

02:52.516 --> 02:55.543
- Well, shouldn't it?
- So, um,

02:55.845 --> 02:59.920
you're saying that you can be

03:00.177 --> 03:05.723
sexually active and, uh,
still retain moral purity?

03:05.736 --> 03:08.653
Well, not just me, sister,
if you know what I'm saying.

03:08.665 --> 03:10.012
Nice, yeah.

03:10.305 --> 03:14.293
Well, no, no because,
'cause what I'm actually saying is,

03:14.577 --> 03:19.390
at the end of the day, it's just,
it's just us in the mirror

03:20.096 --> 03:23.893
and we're the ones who determine
our own moral value.

03:24.316 --> 03:27.182
To me, that's what--
that's what Christmas is all about.

03:31.216 --> 03:33.671
So... you're not mad at me anymore?

03:35.436 --> 03:38.592
This is the first time in a week
I've seen you smile.

03:40.206 --> 03:44.440
The holiday spirit is just so infectious,
I couldn't help myself, and, um,

03:44.876 --> 03:46.750
I was waiting for you to lighten up.

03:47.018 --> 03:48.143
Really?

03:48.507 --> 03:50.380
I was waiting for you.

03:52.077 --> 03:54.982
Don't try to be charming
in that ridiculous outfit.

03:54.998 --> 03:57.022
Huh, me, charming?

04:01.268 --> 04:03.351
- Back off, Rudolph.
- Be nice.

04:03.367 --> 04:04.941
You be nice.

04:06.706 --> 04:08.690
You're not going to get
your special present.

04:08.708 --> 04:10.302
Mm, what kind of present?

04:10.318 --> 04:15.300
- Mm... a slightly naughty one.
- My favorite kind.

04:16.747 --> 04:18.101
Dr. Kovac.

04:18.546 --> 04:21.370
- Sorry. You got a minute?
- Yeah, sure, sure, yeah.

04:21.548 --> 04:22.972
It's about Curtis Ames.

04:23.075 --> 04:25.773
He's filed an order
of protection against you.

04:26.075 --> 04:28.981
- A restraining order.
- That's ridiculous.

04:29.007 --> 04:31.142
Yeah, well, the judge
who issued it doesn't think so.

04:31.155 --> 04:33.850
- The guy says you threatened to kill him.
- What?

04:34.585 --> 04:36.521
Look, you should have let it go, doc.

04:36.837 --> 04:39.203
Now you look like the crazy one.

Rufus Taylor, 35. Going 60 on the Dan
Ryan, crashed into an embankment.

04:57.308 --> 04:59.940
Icicle shattered the windshield;
I couldn't see.

04:59.958 --> 05:02.160
- Icicle, huh?
- Came out of nowhere.

05:02.178 --> 05:04.441
- It was really big.
- Anything hurt, man?

05:04.448 --> 05:05.602
My stomach.

05:05.618 --> 05:08.253
All right, Trauma One, let's go.
Gates, what's the RTS on this guy?

05:08.265 --> 05:10.433
- The what?
- RTS-- revised trauma score.

05:10.447 --> 05:13.121
It correlates better than GCS
with traumatic brain injury.

05:13.138 --> 05:15.703
- Traumatic brain what?
- You'll be fine, sir.

05:15.715 --> 05:17.703
- What's the matter with you?
- My shift was over.

05:17.718 --> 05:19.302
I couldn't leave because
you weren't here.

05:19.318 --> 05:20.633
I was five minutes late.

05:20.776 --> 05:22.551
All right, ten minutes.
I'm here, now go.

05:22.676 --> 05:25.012
Look, you have remedial command
of the basics. I can't leave you alone.

05:25.017 --> 05:28.190
I would love to, believe me,
but it wouldn't be right, all right?

05:40.936 --> 05:43.083
Hey, merry Christmas, Neela!

05:43.247 --> 05:45.673
- Where have you been?
- On the floor. I thought we were rounding.

05:45.688 --> 05:47.010
What?! No.

05:47.028 --> 05:50.073
The surgery Christmas party is
the one time of year we can forget

05:50.086 --> 05:54.331
about disease and death and
celebrate goodness and kindness.

05:54.678 --> 05:58.741
I admit I would prefer black tie,
sashimi, and Veuve Clicquot, but

05:58.758 --> 06:01.993
still, it's Christmas and I love it.

06:04.885 --> 06:06.743
- Yeah.
- Are you all right?

06:06.758 --> 06:08.813
Sorry, it's got to be this punch.

06:09.365 --> 06:12.142
There's nothing even remotely
alcoholic in the punch, Dustin.

06:12.158 --> 06:14.921
Right, okay.
Uh... gotta go.

06:15.457 --> 06:17.240
Neela, I want you to meet Manish Mayta.

06:17.256 --> 06:19.362
He's going to be helping us
out around here a while.

06:19.776 --> 06:22.441
Uh, can I get everybody's attention
for a second, please?

06:22.777 --> 06:25.002
Everybody.
Listen up for a sec.

06:25.245 --> 06:26.081
Thanks.

06:26.105 --> 06:32.082
Listen, it's fitting and appropriate at
this time of charity and compassion

06:32.106 --> 06:37.510
for me to be able to announce the opening
of Chicago's only Paired Exchange Program.

06:38.778 --> 06:43.923
And as an additional yuletide treat, we
will be doing our first kidney swap today.

06:45.058 --> 06:48.140
Why don't we all get back to work
before we crash from the sugar high?

06:50.847 --> 06:54.243
Neela, hi.
Rob.

06:54.257 --> 06:55.733
You guys know each other, right?

06:55.747 --> 06:58.593
Neela Rasgotra.
I've heard a lot about you.

06:58.605 --> 06:59.421
You have?

06:59.435 --> 07:02.751
Well, you're the golden girl Dubenko
created a special residency spot for.

07:02.765 --> 07:04.093
That's memorable.

07:04.785 --> 07:08.040
- God, you must really be something.
- Okay, then.

07:08.055 --> 07:11.221
- It's nice to meet you, Rob.
- The pleasure is all mine.

07:14.357 --> 07:15.953
Would you excuse me a minute?

07:23.016 --> 07:26.232
- You went to where Ames works?
- Well, the police wouldn't do anything.

07:26.248 --> 07:28.652
Then you threatened to kill him
and I'm the one

07:28.667 --> 07:30.461
- who overreacted?
- You think I made all this up?

07:30.475 --> 07:33.662
- I think you got carried away, yeah.
- I went to his work to make him stop,

07:33.678 --> 07:36.121
- to scare him off.
- Mission accomplished. He's scared--

07:36.137 --> 07:38.193
he can have you arrested
if you get anywhere near him.

07:38.206 --> 07:40.473
Look, I didn't know
what else to do, okay?

07:41.098 --> 07:43.173
I did it because
I love you and I love Joe

07:43.188 --> 07:46.240
and I wasn't going to let that asshole
keep threatening us, okay?

07:50.456 --> 07:54.102
- So, it wasn't too geeky, was it?
- Geeky? Lord, no.

07:54.117 --> 07:57.653
I mean, God, no. I mean, no.
No, I enjoyed your Bible group.

07:57.958 --> 07:59.491
They were impressed by you.

07:59.508 --> 08:03.120
- What you said was really advanced.
- Really? You think?

08:03.136 --> 08:06.211
- Yeah, I do.
- Oh... donuts. Ha, ha.

08:06.465 --> 08:08.423
The perks of authority.

08:09.415 --> 08:12.753
No. No, no, no.
Wh-What does this look like?

08:13.156 --> 08:15.381
- Gluttony?
- Gluttony. Exactly.

08:15.396 --> 08:16.960
I was just testing you.

08:18.574 --> 08:21.463
Lenore Simpkins, found down on
the street on 18th and Aberdeen.

08:21.477 --> 08:23.893
Pulse ox is 91, looks like frostbite
on the fingertips.

08:23.904 --> 08:26.692
- It's cold out there.
- Hi, Lenore, I'm Dr. Morris.

08:26.809 --> 08:29.210
I would wish you a merry Christmas,
but as an employee of the County,

08:29.227 --> 08:32.552
I am duty-bound to respect
the separation of church and state.

08:32.638 --> 08:34.210
Are you kidding?

08:34.534 --> 08:36.903
- Is he kidding?
- I think so.

08:42.597 --> 08:44.443
- You got plans tonight?
- Yeah.

08:44.455 --> 08:46.762
Yeah, me, too.
With Ray.

08:47.398 --> 08:50.373
- That's cool, right?
- It's none of my business.

08:50.385 --> 08:53.571
Okay. I just wanted to be sure.

08:55.116 --> 08:56.543
You look annoyed.

08:57.278 --> 09:00.522
Well, your friend from vascular
went in almost ten minutes ago.

09:00.718 --> 09:03.100
Yeah, I could tell you kind of
aggravated his problem.

09:03.135 --> 09:04.292
What problem?

09:04.606 --> 09:08.041
Rob's got a little
auto-stimulation issue.

09:08.645 --> 09:09.462
You know.

09:09.475 --> 09:13.260
He can't help tickling the Elmo,
spanking his monkey.

09:13.277 --> 09:14.680
That's how he got his nickname.

09:14.696 --> 09:18.750
- What nickname?
- We call him "McCreamy."

09:19.027 --> 09:20.893
Mc-Creamy?

09:24.805 --> 09:27.540
Oh, hey, guys.
Sorry about the wait.

09:27.548 --> 09:28.752
It's okay.

09:28.766 --> 09:31.441
God, it was great to finally
meet you, Neela.

09:31.696 --> 09:34.040
I hope we get to work
together soon.

09:35.467 --> 09:36.883
I gotta go.

09:38.957 --> 09:40.412
How's that, Lenore?
Better?

09:43.937 --> 09:45.591
What are you doing for the holidays?

09:45.608 --> 09:49.082
Uh, you mean besides taking my kid
to go see Return of the Evil Zombies?

09:49.518 --> 09:51.990
Well, maybe before you go home,
you could let me buy you that drink?

09:52.727 --> 09:55.793
I don't know.
I got presents to wrap.

09:59.458 --> 10:03.740
- Lenore, were you recently hospitalized?
- I was at City of Mercy till last night.

10:04.348 --> 10:08.462
- What for?
- Chest cold. Winter's been hard.

10:08.477 --> 10:10.153
How long were you there?

10:11.318 --> 10:13.693
Mm, a few days.

10:13.948 --> 10:15.671
I'm not good with time.

10:15.986 --> 10:17.582
And did they release you?

10:17.868 --> 10:22.072
The lady at the hospital said the
ambulance was gonna take me back.

10:22.387 --> 10:24.761
- Back home?
- Don't got one.

10:25.297 --> 10:27.422
I make my own way.

10:27.948 --> 10:29.632
Well, then where'd they drop you off?

10:29.887 --> 10:33.602
They left me in a alley near 18th Street.

10:35.456 --> 10:38.620
I haven't slept in that
neighborhood in years.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.970
- Second unit's infusing now?
- I need sterile tens and a cordis.

10:41.986 --> 10:44.582
- He needs central access.
- This is not a good teaching case.

10:44.596 --> 10:46.702
- I'll handle this.
- I know how to put in a line, Ray.

10:46.718 --> 10:50.112
Mr. Taylor, we need to do an operation
to stop the bleeding in your abdomen.

10:50.127 --> 10:51.790
Is there someone you want
to be here with you?

10:51.806 --> 10:55.900
No. You sure this can't wait?
I-I don't really want this, not today.

10:55.918 --> 10:57.341
It's okay, you'll be fine.

10:57.358 --> 11:00.040
No, it's just that my karma's
not so good right now.

11:00.058 --> 11:01.622
It's not the best time
to go under the knife.

11:01.638 --> 11:03.962
Don't worry, sir.
Here at County, we treat the naughty

11:03.975 --> 11:07.513
- as well as the nice all year round.
- We'll take good care of you.

11:07.696 --> 11:09.962
I promise this is the best thing.

11:09.978 --> 11:13.162
- Mayday.
- OR 2, Dubenko should be waiting.

11:13.755 --> 11:15.032
Mayday!

11:15.756 --> 11:18.311
Yeah, uh, go on, I'll be right up.

11:24.917 --> 11:27.013
- Lizzie's sick.
- Teller, we were worried about you.

11:27.025 --> 11:29.011
Lizzie's sick. You need to come.

11:29.026 --> 11:31.390
Was she your friend?
Does she have what Paulie had?

11:31.408 --> 11:34.491
I don't know.
You need to come.

11:35.405 --> 11:36.661
All right, wait there.

11:36.678 --> 11:39.930
Pick up the old chart from records
and get the echo from C.I.C.U.

11:39.945 --> 11:42.333
What about the toilet bowls, Ray?
I haven't scrubbed them down yet.

11:42.346 --> 11:44.832
- Tony, come with me a minute?
- Thank God you're here to save me.

11:44.846 --> 11:45.992
Whoa, where do you think you're going?

11:46.006 --> 11:48.772
What, do you have a toenail extraction
you want me to take notes on?

11:48.956 --> 11:50.783
Are you too advanced for this stuff?

11:50.808 --> 11:53.502
Look, if we have a problem, man, just spit
it out, 'cause I don't speak "bitchy."

11:53.518 --> 11:57.271
Oh, you seem pretty fluent to me.
Get somebody else, my intern's busy.

11:57.287 --> 12:00.103
Ray, stop being an idiot.
I need Tony's help.

12:00.538 --> 12:02.190
And you, too.
I've had enough.

12:02.207 --> 12:05.803
Why don't you either slap each other
silly or kiss now and get it over with?

12:10.375 --> 12:13.151
Pains everywhere.

12:13.168 --> 12:14.492
Tell me where she is,
and I'll send an ambulance.

12:14.506 --> 12:17.180
- No! I'll take you.
- Doesn't work like that.

12:17.196 --> 12:21.123
- Please. You helped Paulie.
- You heard about Paulie?

12:21.357 --> 12:23.101
I came back a few days after.

12:23.115 --> 12:25.503
The man at the desk said
he was at the care unit.

12:25.616 --> 12:27.302
That's good, right?

12:27.596 --> 12:28.592
Come on!

12:28.606 --> 12:30.481
If she's sick,
she needs to be in a hospital.

12:30.498 --> 12:34.013
She can't walk and she won't
go to a family again.

12:34.576 --> 12:37.911
- You come-- Mayday and you.
- She can't. We can't.

12:37.926 --> 12:41.082
You have to.
Or else I'm scared Lizzie's gonna pass.

12:42.008 --> 12:44.171
- All right, I'm out of here.
- What? No.

12:44.187 --> 12:47.111
You can't go. I got no Kovac,
no Weaver and no Pratt.

12:47.125 --> 12:48.450
I'm flying without a net here.

12:48.466 --> 12:51.910
I'd prefer to be outside of the ER
when it crashes and burns to the ground.

12:51.918 --> 12:54.011
- What?
- Yeah, that's what the Vegas oddsmakers say

12:54.025 --> 12:56.923
will happen the first time
you're the only attending on the floor.

12:57.015 --> 13:00.810
Melia! What...?
What are you doing here?

13:00.827 --> 13:02.212
Daddy...

13:03.028 --> 13:03.851
Daddy?

13:03.867 --> 13:06.781
Great, another one of
Morris's petri dish kids.

13:06.798 --> 13:09.760
- Wait, Morris has kids?
- Four, that we know of.

13:09.765 --> 13:11.161
- Hope, could you please...?
- Right,

13:11.175 --> 13:14.821
no, I will take her to the break room,
get her all settled in. Come on.

13:14.837 --> 13:17.002
Read her a story or something.

13:18.368 --> 13:20.643
What? Hey, Morris, it's important,
I need a half hour.

13:21.328 --> 13:23.151
- Okay.
- Come on, it's slow, you can spare...

13:23.168 --> 13:24.373
- You just say "okay"?
- Yeah.

13:24.385 --> 13:27.133
Me, you're trying to leverage, him,
you're just gonna let him go?

13:27.187 --> 13:28.891
You're a resident, he's an intern.

13:28.908 --> 13:30.490
- I have a date.
- So?

13:30.497 --> 13:33.481
My daughter's here, Ray-- my daughter.
You don't see me shirking.

13:33.495 --> 13:35.713
Fine, go.
I'm already over you.

13:35.736 --> 13:39.922
- Hey, Sam, you have a car?
- Uh, I heard snow, I took a train.

13:40.668 --> 13:44.012
- The truck's in the shop.
- I got to check on a patient for Neela.

13:44.316 --> 13:46.052
Hi, can I talk to your supervisor?

13:47.175 --> 13:49.692
- What about Malik? Is he around?
- No, he's not in today.

13:50.008 --> 13:52.801
This is the second time I've called.
Can you ask her to call me?

13:53.318 --> 13:54.801
Sam Taggart.

13:56.925 --> 13:59.373
Mercy said she walked out
on her own, as far as they know.

13:59.387 --> 14:01.671
Some administrator's gonna get into it.

14:02.208 --> 14:03.742
Looks like they already have.

14:04.568 --> 14:06.312
What? Hey!
Hey, hey, hey.

14:06.335 --> 14:07.942
Where are you going?
She's not ready for transfer.

14:07.958 --> 14:09.101
- You the nurse on this one?
- Yeah.

14:09.117 --> 14:10.951
We're from Mercy, we're gonna take her off your hands.

14:10.967 --> 14:12.693
- You're gonna what?
- Our supervisor said

14:12.695 --> 14:14.992
- it was all a misunderstanding.
- Are you taking me back outside?

14:15.006 --> 14:18.082
No, uh-uh. You're not taking her anywhere
until somebody explains what's going on.

14:18.098 --> 14:20.000
Come on, a patient ended up
in the wrong place.

14:20.026 --> 14:23.051
- Let's not blow this out of proportion.
- No, you heard the lady.

14:23.066 --> 14:24.382
Turn it around.

14:27.098 --> 14:29.711
- How far is this place?
- Just across the bridge.

14:31.197 --> 14:32.803
Hey, watch it, jerk off!

14:34.216 --> 14:36.063
I heard you needed a ride.

14:42.355 --> 14:44.322
What's the pancreas do?

14:44.335 --> 14:49.553
It makes hormones that help you process sugar in your blood.

14:49.925 --> 14:52.483
- What are hormones?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, okay,

14:52.507 --> 14:56.123
you'll find out about that soon enough.
I was thinking Dr. Seuss, not Dr. Rosen.

14:57.167 --> 15:00.883
- It's okay. I like gross stuff.
- Honey, Melia, it's so good to see you.

15:00.898 --> 15:02.570
What are you doing here?

15:03.548 --> 15:04.900
I ran away.

15:05.827 --> 15:10.032
- Why, sweetie?
- Because of Donald, Mom's new husband.

15:10.048 --> 15:13.840
He won't let me celebrate Christmas.
He says there's no such thing as Santa.

15:13.856 --> 15:18.122
- No, he didn't.
- He says there's no elves, no reindeer

15:18.138 --> 15:20.830
and Christmas is just made up
so people will spend money.

15:20.847 --> 15:23.091
No, that's crazy.

15:23.248 --> 15:27.470
So I decided I would spend
the holiday with my real dad.

15:27.867 --> 15:29.573
That's you.

15:35.298 --> 15:38.690
Crystal meth-- some nasty stuff.

15:39.945 --> 15:41.763
Makes you lie.

15:41.975 --> 15:43.793
Makes you paranoid.

15:44.716 --> 15:48.482
- I'm clean now.
- Good for you.

15:48.675 --> 15:50.123
It's too late.

15:50.175 --> 15:54.551
My wife, my kids moved away
as far as they could.

15:59.195 --> 16:02.851
I m-m...
I messed up so much.

16:04.878 --> 16:08.140
I missed so much when I was high.

16:12.815 --> 16:14.851
This is where they live.

16:22.257 --> 16:26.340
Oliver's 11 now, and Julia is nine.

16:26.358 --> 16:28.803
They've gone so many years without
hearing from me on Christmas...

16:28.818 --> 16:33.602
Mr. Taylor, I fully expect
this surgery to be a success.

16:33.618 --> 16:36.440
I-I know.
But if you're wrong...

16:37.777 --> 16:40.513
promise me you'll send them something.

16:41.036 --> 16:44.930
Won't be necessary.
But okay.

16:46.907 --> 16:49.331
Thank you.
Thank you.

16:52.478 --> 16:53.770
We should call this in.

16:53.788 --> 16:55.350
What if this girl's really messed up?

16:55.596 --> 16:58.880
If you make anybody come,
we'll just run away someplace else.

16:58.896 --> 17:00.331
It'll be fine.

17:02.826 --> 17:03.902
Stop!

17:04.665 --> 17:05.980
It's here.

17:06.238 --> 17:07.723
Hurry!

17:09.385 --> 17:10.863
What the hell are we doing?

17:12.196 --> 17:14.002
We're helping kids, Ray.

17:14.297 --> 17:15.813
It's down here.

17:16.987 --> 17:18.490
Love what you've done with the place.

17:18.515 --> 17:19.681
Follow me.

17:20.876 --> 17:22.340
Ah, that's great.

17:22.627 --> 17:24.180
Big old mouse hole.

17:24.827 --> 17:27.433
- Jejunum looks good.
- So's the liver.

17:27.446 --> 17:29.501
Lucien, Victoria's on the phone again.

17:29.515 --> 17:32.672
She wants to know if you'd like her
to wear the blue dress or the red dress.

17:32.685 --> 17:36.333
- Tell her the blue's nice.
- Ileo-cecal junction's clear.

17:36.377 --> 17:39.131
- Hot date tonight?
- Something like that.

17:39.385 --> 17:43.100
- BP's down, 86 over 40.
- Retroperitoneum feels tense.

17:43.118 --> 17:45.212
Bovie to Neela, open it up.

17:45.606 --> 17:48.000
- Tachy to 120.
- Hang the blood on the infuser.

17:48.015 --> 17:49.793
Whoa. Suction, now.

17:49.806 --> 17:52.052
- He's bleeding out.
- Satinsky.

17:52.618 --> 17:54.882
- Packing. Keep it coming.
- 5-O proline.

17:54.896 --> 17:56.503
On Castro Viejos.

17:56.518 --> 17:58.641
P.E.A., lost the pulse.
Starting compressions.

17:58.656 --> 18:02.241
- Amp of epi, call for more blood.
- It's too fast, there's no way to...

18:02.257 --> 18:05.192
Ah, crap, it's here.
Sponge stick times two, let's go!

18:05.206 --> 18:07.822
- 5-O proline to me.
- I've got pressure...

18:07.885 --> 18:12.291
- above... and below.
- Okay, release pressure.

18:15.245 --> 18:18.340
- Repair's holding.
- Stop CPR.

18:20.727 --> 18:23.093
- Normal sinus.
- Good pulse.

18:23.118 --> 18:25.262
Well, strong work, Dr. Rasgotra.

18:25.277 --> 18:29.113
Well, once you've seen one super-celiac
aortic tear, you've seen them all.

18:33.085 --> 18:37.162
- Don't be scared, it's safe.
- Thanks. I feel much better now.

18:37.178 --> 18:40.392
I'm sure you've played gigs
in worse places than this.

18:40.407 --> 18:42.813
- Oh, God!
- Come on!

18:43.675 --> 18:46.612
- Who's that?
- Who's with him?

18:46.717 --> 18:49.100
- You said you'd get Mayday!
- It's okay.

18:49.116 --> 18:50.853
He helped save Paulie.

18:51.935 --> 18:53.431
She's diaphoretic.

18:54.005 --> 18:57.331
- Please, please, make this go away!
- Yeah, and tachycardic.

18:57.407 --> 18:59.512
Hey, Lizzie, Lizzie,
do you know what day it is?

18:59.536 --> 19:02.322
- It's Christmas.
- That's close enough. She's lucid.

19:02.736 --> 19:04.360
She's pregnant.

19:05.157 --> 19:07.971
Yeah, she's very pregnant.
The baby's crowning.

19:08.196 --> 19:11.510
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
I don't know how this happened!

19:18.088 --> 19:20.530
Next time, give it your all.
Come on, push!

19:20.537 --> 19:22.383
- I can't!
- Yes, you can, attagirl, come on.

19:22.397 --> 19:25.553
- Attagirl! Come on!
- Teller, who's this baby's father?

19:25.567 --> 19:27.881
- It doesn't have a father!
- Of course it does.

19:27.898 --> 19:30.381
- Lizzie will get the men to help us.
- Ruby, quiet!

19:30.397 --> 19:33.571
- Ray, the shoulder's stuck.
- Please get it out! I can't!

19:33.587 --> 19:37.232
- Firm downward pressure on the head.
- I am! I am!

19:38.458 --> 19:40.102
Want to take a shot at it?

19:40.376 --> 19:41.943
- Okay.
- All right.

19:41.948 --> 19:43.022
Here.

19:43.558 --> 19:45.652
What is she talking about?
What men?

19:45.668 --> 19:48.152
The Greek gives us food
from the restaurant.

19:48.168 --> 19:50.800
The cripple lets us sleep in the basement
when it's really cold.

19:50.818 --> 19:53.760
Lizzie takes care of them,
and they take care of us.

19:54.858 --> 19:57.203
- Okay.
- All right, here we go.

19:57.967 --> 20:01.483
- Here we go. Here we go.
- All right.

20:01.505 --> 20:04.981
Okay, it's a boy. It's a boy.

20:20.007 --> 20:22.042
- There you go.
- Okay.

20:23.908 --> 20:26.512
- There you go.
- Okay. Hold the head.

20:28.588 --> 20:30.552
There you go.

20:35.966 --> 20:37.661
He's mine?

20:40.706 --> 20:42.713
So tiny.

20:46.335 --> 20:48.890
- What are you doing?
- Calling for help.

20:48.905 --> 20:50.972
Teller, get them and run!

20:51.278 --> 20:53.750
Hey, Lizzie, you and your baby
need to be seen by a doctor.

20:53.765 --> 20:56.183
- You're a doctor!
- Look, we can't do what they need here.

20:56.205 --> 20:58.481
- Teller, get them and go.
- Hey, it's okay, guys.

20:58.508 --> 20:59.942
- Teller, go!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

20:59.955 --> 21:01.473
Okay, I won't, I won't, I won't.

21:01.487 --> 21:03.551
You guys just need
to spend the night the ER, okay?

21:03.566 --> 21:06.213
You, Lizzie and the baby,
just the three of you.

21:06.225 --> 21:09.231
Gates, they all need to come.
They look jaundiced, anemic,

21:09.248 --> 21:10.483
- they got scabies...
- The others can stay here.

21:10.507 --> 21:12.903
I won't call foster care
or Social Services, all right?

21:12.917 --> 21:15.283
Gates, what are you doing?

21:16.968 --> 21:19.052
- Promise?
- Yeah, I promise.

21:27.705 --> 21:29.133
He lost a lot of blood in there.

21:29.146 --> 21:31.450
Could be a while before
we know his neurologic outcome.

21:31.466 --> 21:32.871
I know.

21:35.425 --> 21:36.862
Where are you spending Christmas?

21:36.878 --> 21:39.601
Oh, I spend the holidays
with my sister every year.

21:39.616 --> 21:41.700
That's sweet.
Older or younger?

21:41.847 --> 21:47.580
Both, actually.
Two years older, but stuck at 17.

21:48.046 --> 21:51.130
Was in a car wreck the night of her prom.
Her boyfriend was drunk.

21:51.147 --> 21:52.621
That's awful.

21:53.308 --> 21:54.600
Could have been worse, though.

21:54.868 --> 21:59.323
She's in an independent living facility
in Evanston. I see her fairly frequently.

22:00.108 --> 22:03.271
In fact, I got to get out of here.
We have a nice dinner tonight.

22:03.286 --> 22:05.171
She likes to dress up.

22:16.515 --> 22:20.120
- Your oxygen level's back up.
- Am I gonna be able to stay here?

22:20.498 --> 22:21.720
Uh, well, you're getting better.

22:21.736 --> 22:24.433
You don't really need
to be hospitalized anymore.

22:24.775 --> 22:26.840
Is there somewhere that you'd like to go?

22:27.415 --> 22:30.823
Not the street, not tonight.

22:31.387 --> 22:33.150
Got any family?

22:33.537 --> 22:36.902
Well, my parents are in Gary,
Indiana, where I grew up,

22:37.306 --> 22:39.340
but we haven't talked in a long time.

22:39.695 --> 22:42.431
I don't know if they'd even recognize me.

22:43.876 --> 22:46.420
I'll be back to check on you
in a little bit, okay?

22:47.375 --> 22:49.640
- Any word from Mercy?
- Not yet.

22:50.057 --> 22:52.270
Poor lady's all alone in the world.

22:52.797 --> 22:56.323
At least we can clean her up, set her up
with a new set of clothes for Christmas.

22:56.577 --> 22:57.750
I'll see what I can do.

22:58.165 --> 23:02.182
Hey, Sam, Drunk Santa needs a banana
bag and a few hours to sleep it off.

23:02.197 --> 23:06.061
- That's such a shame.
- Yeah, sloth, sloth, sloth.

23:06.437 --> 23:09.491
15-year-old, postpartum, needs stitches.

23:09.505 --> 23:12.052
Little newborn baby, needs a warmer
and pedes consult.

23:12.108 --> 23:15.051
- Where'd you find them?
- We followed a star in the northern sky.

23:15.077 --> 23:16.651
Okay, Trauma Two.

23:17.165 --> 23:19.460
Children's services is on their way.
I called up.

23:20.395 --> 23:21.863
You did what?!

23:22.598 --> 23:23.772
It'll be okay, Teller.

23:23.878 --> 23:26.072
- You promised!
- What?

23:26.087 --> 23:27.983
You swore you wouldn't force
them into the system.

23:28.005 --> 23:30.830
- Well, I got them here, didn't I?
- You said we could trust you.

23:30.938 --> 23:32.872
Yes. Nice job, Gates.

23:37.935 --> 23:42.000
- You from Mercy?
- Nurse Taggart? Hillary Lerner.

23:42.028 --> 23:45.143
Is your policy to dump
destitute patients on the street?

23:45.467 --> 23:48.240
- Why would we do that?
- Because it's bad for your neighborhood.

23:48.258 --> 23:50.800
- No, there was a mistake with Miss...
- Simpkins.

23:50.826 --> 23:53.340
- Lenore Simpkins.
- Yes. That's why I sent my people...

23:53.355 --> 23:55.790
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna release her
just so you can have a second chance

23:55.806 --> 23:57.533
to make her disappear down
some scummy alley.

23:57.547 --> 23:59.670
- I don't know what she told you.
- Come with me.

23:59.737 --> 24:02.973
As far as I see it, you behaved very
badly, so here's your lump of coal, okay?

24:02.985 --> 24:04.061
You're gonna have your boys

24:04.106 --> 24:06.731
take Miss Simpkins to
her parents' place in Gary, Indiana.

24:06.745 --> 24:08.092
Gary?
That's over an hour away.

24:08.108 --> 24:11.372
You will pay for the full round-trip service,
and this will never happen again.

24:11.477 --> 24:14.163
Because I ever get wind of another
patient being dumped by your hospital,

24:14.177 --> 24:17.043
I will call the cops and the news
so fast that I'm not sure

24:17.058 --> 24:19.920
if you're going to get fired or
arrested first. You got me, lady?

24:20.267 --> 24:21.463
Yeah.

24:22.576 --> 24:25.322
Hey, Lenore.
This is Hillary.

24:25.338 --> 24:28.151
She's gonna make sure you get
to see your parents for Christmas.

24:32.828 --> 24:37.111
We, by which I mean to say,
Dr. Gates, promise no foster care.

24:37.276 --> 24:40.762
Well, that would be a mistake.
By law, they need to be placed.

24:40.775 --> 24:42.451
Well, getting them to give up
the life they have,

24:42.467 --> 24:44.373
and come in, that takes
a light touch, Ray.

24:44.385 --> 24:46.040
Is that what you call lying to them?

24:46.055 --> 24:47.762
I wasn't gonna take a chance
on losing them again.

24:47.776 --> 24:51.101
You turned us into every bad adult
these kids were ever screwed by.

24:51.118 --> 24:53.522
Aw, that's so sweet and so naive.

24:53.838 --> 24:55.651
Look, I'll send a van to pick up
the other children, huh?

24:55.678 --> 24:56.730
- Good.
- No, no, no.

24:56.747 --> 24:59.111
look, if you pick them up today
they'll be gone tomorrow.

24:59.206 --> 25:00.543
Look, these kids won't just submit,

25:00.556 --> 25:02.920
they need to be convinced that
they'll be safe and protected.

25:03.198 --> 25:04.990
We'll try to keep them
together in a group home,

25:05.006 --> 25:07.322
but I can't promise
they won't end up in foster care.

25:07.598 --> 25:09.752
But you'll follow up and make sure they're okay, right?

25:09.777 --> 25:12.413
- We always do.
- Okay, come on, man. These kids are smart.

25:12.427 --> 25:15.373
- They know that that's not how it goes.
- A social worker will follow up.

25:15.387 --> 25:17.933
- It's the best I can do.
- No, no, no, no, no.

25:17.948 --> 25:19.390
That's not good enough.

25:20.497 --> 25:22.730
Can't believe you got CPS
to agree to that.

25:22.746 --> 25:27.580
- Well, actually it was Ray's brainstorm.
- The trick's getting the kids to accept it.

25:28.478 --> 25:32.352
Teller, listen.
Child protective services has...

25:32.367 --> 25:35.161
arranged for all of you to live
together in a group home.

25:35.476 --> 25:38.860
- You said no foster care!
- Now, hear us out, Teller.

25:38.877 --> 25:40.172
- Wait, Teller!
- No!

25:40.188 --> 25:44.172
- I won't go! You lied!
- It's not safe out there, all right?

25:44.657 --> 25:47.460
We survive.
No one hurts us.

25:47.477 --> 25:50.290
What Lizzie's doing having sex
with men for money and shelter.

25:50.306 --> 25:51.452
That's hurting her.

25:51.467 --> 25:53.202
- That's hurting all of you.
- Don't say that!

25:53.228 --> 25:55.410
If you weren't sleeping
in old abandoned buildings,

25:55.425 --> 25:57.781
Paulie would never have gotten sick.

25:58.076 --> 25:59.690
But you fixed him.

26:00.575 --> 26:04.393
- He's getting better.
- No, we didn't.

26:05.167 --> 26:07.022
Paulie died.

26:13.946 --> 26:16.980
I'm sorry.
I wanted to tell you his...

26:17.456 --> 26:20.792
his infection was too severe,
and we couldn't save him, but...

26:21.047 --> 26:22.230
I want to see him.

26:22.276 --> 26:24.531
I know I lied to you, but I'm not
going to lie to you anymore.

26:24.545 --> 26:26.490
- I don't believe you!
- It's not working.

26:26.507 --> 26:29.392
The way you're living is not working,
man. You're a smart kid...

26:29.406 --> 26:31.561
- I know you can see that.
- Let go of me!

26:31.575 --> 26:34.671
Listen to me.
You can't go on like this anymore.

26:42.077 --> 26:46.122
Teller, Lizzie agreed to go.

26:47.738 --> 26:49.622
It's the only way she can keep her baby.

26:52.636 --> 26:55.492
And the rest of us
will just stay with them?

26:55.938 --> 26:57.442
That's right.

26:57.547 --> 26:59.411
And Doctor Gates will come and visit

26:59.427 --> 27:02.653
every two weeks and make sure
things are okay, all right?

27:04.395 --> 27:08.040
You need me for anything at anytime,
you call me and I'll be there.

27:09.557 --> 27:12.983
- You would do that?
- Yeah.

27:16.485 --> 27:21.652
Listen, I need you to take the social
workers to where the others are,

27:21.855 --> 27:24.820
and let the kids know that it's okay
and it's safe to come in.

27:24.875 --> 27:26.423
You do that?

27:28.147 --> 27:30.082
I'll wait with you here, Teller, come on.

27:31.635 --> 27:32.960
Thank you.

27:33.975 --> 27:38.193
- Well, that went better than expected.
- Yeah?

27:38.207 --> 27:40.641
That kid might not survive
another round of your games.

27:40.658 --> 27:43.383
Come on, I've been trying
to help the kid all day.

27:43.668 --> 27:45.642
Look, Gates, you'll say anything
to seal the deal.

27:45.658 --> 27:47.300
I understand that.
Hell, I've done that.

27:47.315 --> 27:49.982
But these are messed up kids.
You gotta draw the line somewhere.

27:50.006 --> 27:52.210
And what line is that, Ray?

27:53.356 --> 27:56.650
If you're making promises
you have no intention of keeping,

27:57.455 --> 28:00.883
just cut loose, minimize
the damage, okay?

28:03.246 --> 28:05.421
This isn't just about the kids, is it?

28:07.378 --> 28:09.402
No. It's not.

28:16.075 --> 28:21.490
Hey, you give me a few hours
to wrap some presents, huh?

28:31.616 --> 28:34.131
- Can we talk?
- Sure.

28:36.956 --> 28:38.722
This scares me.

28:39.875 --> 28:41.562
What? Ames?

28:42.665 --> 28:44.331
What it's doing to you.

28:45.976 --> 28:47.400
To us.

28:50.545 --> 28:54.290
It took us so long to get here.
All of us.

28:54.878 --> 28:58.332
And the way you're acting, and
how it's taken over our whole lives,

28:58.345 --> 29:02.133
it makes me scared
we are going to lose this.

29:12.396 --> 29:16.530
When Jasna and the kids died,
I needed to make a change.

29:16.578 --> 29:18.770
And I decided to move here.

29:19.566 --> 29:21.662
Made my brother really angry.

29:21.995 --> 29:27.813
He said... he said that I was a coward,
that I was running away.

29:29.907 --> 29:34.983
And it's only recently that I've come
to know that he was wrong.

29:37.545 --> 29:40.431
I wasn't running away from anything.

29:42.225 --> 29:44.393
I was running to you.

29:48.798 --> 29:52.020
And I'll never let anything
take this away.

30:14.195 --> 30:17.480
Did I mention how hot
you look in antlers?

30:25.586 --> 30:28.730
- I think she's in here, Santa.
- Ho, ho, ho!

30:29.058 --> 30:31.410
Has anyone seen a little girl
named Melia Simon?

30:31.436 --> 30:33.150
- That's her, right there.
- Oh!

30:33.178 --> 30:37.273
My reindeer needed a little rest,
so I thought I'd come by and say hi.

30:38.375 --> 30:41.281
- How do you do? I'm Santa Claus.
- Hi, Santa.

30:41.446 --> 30:43.850
Can't stay long.
Very, very busy. Got to...

30:43.866 --> 30:47.680
got to deliver presents to
the whole western hemisphere tonight.

30:47.985 --> 30:50.533
Nice try, Archie.
I know it's you.

30:51.215 --> 30:54.230
Archie?
Who's Archie?

30:54.555 --> 30:58.292
I'm nine years old.
I know there's no Santa, okay?

30:58.615 --> 31:03.131
You know, you're a bright girl, Melia,
but you're wrong about that.

31:03.345 --> 31:06.053
It's a fake beard and a dumb suit.

31:06.348 --> 31:09.261
Don't you know that there's a rule

31:09.277 --> 31:13.083
that if millions of kids believe
in the same thing, it becomes real?

31:13.307 --> 31:14.951
- That's not a rule.
- Yeah.

31:14.976 --> 31:20.253
Every time you're generous or thoughtful
or help someone who needs help,

31:20.275 --> 31:22.171
that's a little bit of Santa, too.

31:23.386 --> 31:25.550
What are you talking about?

31:27.015 --> 31:28.232
Come on.

31:28.976 --> 31:33.992
Santa Claus represents one of the last
remaining bits of magic left in this world.

31:34.008 --> 31:39.141
Now, I still believe,
so don't spoil it for me, okay?

31:40.946 --> 31:43.560
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

31:48.698 --> 31:52.272
- Ho, ho, ho!
- Wait, it's Santa!

31:52.286 --> 31:56.010
Oh, you were a very,
very nice girl this year.

31:56.047 --> 32:00.602
Top of the nice list. Would it be
all right if I signed your cast?

32:02.057 --> 32:03.421
Thank you.

32:05.147 --> 32:07.290
To Greta:

32:08.096 --> 32:10.382
Keep on being nice.

32:10.675 --> 32:12.363
Love, Santa.

32:12.775 --> 32:16.950
- How'd you know my name?
- Come on, I'm Santa Claus, huh.

32:17.005 --> 32:19.681
Merry Christmas.
Ho, ho, ho.

32:19.936 --> 32:22.262
It's the real Santa, isn't it?

32:22.977 --> 32:25.803
Yeah. It is.

32:30.175 --> 32:32.720
You lost almost a third
of your blood volume.

32:32.895 --> 32:35.953
Give us a few days to buff you up.

32:36.986 --> 32:40.470
Plus, I have a present for you.

32:41.565 --> 32:45.243
These... are for them.

32:49.775 --> 32:52.660
Things were a little touch and go
for a while, so I called them.

32:53.786 --> 32:55.901
- How do I explain...?
- It's Christmas.

32:56.007 --> 32:57.900
You don't have to.
Trust me.

33:01.327 --> 33:07.802
Hey, princess. Hey, buddy.
Look at you guys.

33:08.547 --> 33:11.381
- You're all grown up.
- You getting out of here soon?

33:11.497 --> 33:14.902
Oh, I have a cagillion notes to write.

33:15.156 --> 33:17.100
- You look nice.
- Thanks.

33:17.125 --> 33:19.360
- Off to your sister's, I take it?
- Yeah.

33:20.097 --> 33:22.961
That's for you.
Merry Christmas, Neela.

33:23.346 --> 33:24.702
I don't normally do this.

33:24.728 --> 33:28.171
Work presents always end up being
something edible and bad for you, or

33:28.186 --> 33:30.763
something impersonal,
like organic soap.

33:30.775 --> 33:33.771
And who needs that crap cluttering
up their bathroom, anyway?

33:33.786 --> 33:35.840
Oh, loops. Wow.

33:36.217 --> 33:40.851
Yeah, that's my very first pair.
Bought 'em for myself in med. school.

33:41.306 --> 33:43.951
Thank you.
It's a lovely gift.

33:45.685 --> 33:46.723
Listen.

33:48.696 --> 33:53.700
You're an intern and, um,
I'm an attending and there are certain

33:54.145 --> 33:59.613
protocols, certain hierarchies,
that preclude me from...

33:59.625 --> 34:00.350
Lucien...

34:00.376 --> 34:02.563
...being direct about this
but it's Christmas--

34:02.578 --> 34:04.622
so what the hell,
I'm just going to say it:

34:07.936 --> 34:10.612
You are a really good surgeon, Neela.

34:12.717 --> 34:15.413
A few more years and you could be great.

34:18.317 --> 34:19.963
Thank you.

34:22.348 --> 34:23.751
You going to try them on?

34:24.467 --> 34:26.110
Uh, I will.

34:32.855 --> 34:33.981
Beautiful.

34:34.746 --> 34:37.743
You repeat this conversation to anyone,
and I will deny it, you know that.

34:37.777 --> 34:40.900
- What conversation?
- Lovely.

34:41.324 --> 34:42.983
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

34:42.996 --> 34:45.193
Transplant rounds are at 7:00.

35:05.978 --> 35:07.990
Yo, Kris Kringle.
What's going on, Morris?

35:08.147 --> 35:11.281
- Oh, we did okay, Greg.
- Just okay?

35:11.905 --> 35:14.443
Either you rocked the house
or you were closed to patients?

35:14.457 --> 35:16.573
No, we just moved people through.

35:16.698 --> 35:19.313
All right, all right.
Go ahead, you can gloat now.

35:19.338 --> 35:21.680
Tell me all about what
a great manager you are.

35:21.705 --> 35:24.651
"I saved Jerry,
I diagnosed D.I.D., yada-yada."

35:24.675 --> 35:25.923
You know what?

35:27.207 --> 35:29.273
I'm gonna go with humility this time.

35:30.165 --> 35:31.503
For real.

35:33.456 --> 35:34.922
Humili-what?

35:36.377 --> 35:40.113
Hey. I learned a lot watching you today.

35:41.177 --> 35:43.031
Yeah, well, I'm full of it, Hope.

35:44.036 --> 35:46.110
I get it, Archie.

35:46.858 --> 35:52.043
I know you don't believe half of
what you say, but you know what? It...

35:52.867 --> 35:54.702
doesn't really matter,

35:55.007 --> 36:00.933
because I saw you today,
and what I saw was...

36:01.195 --> 36:06.372
a guy who was trying to be good.
And...

36:07.005 --> 36:10.003
I don't know, that right
there is half the battle.

36:13.126 --> 36:15.012
Have a good holiday.

36:15.736 --> 36:17.201
What are you doing?

36:18.727 --> 36:19.701
What?

36:21.486 --> 36:26.670
Now. Are you... going home?
I thought maybe we could, um,

36:27.986 --> 36:31.271
grab a bite, get a drink,
see what happens.

36:34.787 --> 36:37.372
Chastity's always been overrated.

36:37.706 --> 36:43.510
The purity of spirit is
what it's all about, right?

36:43.778 --> 36:46.331
Wait, wait.
Are you...?

36:46.645 --> 36:49.041
What are you, what are you saying?

36:59.295 --> 37:00.600
You know what?

37:05.006 --> 37:07.022
I don't think so.

37:10.065 --> 37:11.751
What?

37:13.038 --> 37:17.470
I, uh, I... I hate,
I hate that I'm saying this--

37:17.937 --> 37:20.993
it's like some dorky angel
has taken control of my mouth--

37:21.825 --> 37:25.023
but... no.

37:27.418 --> 37:28.441
What?

37:29.716 --> 37:30.952
What...?

37:31.035 --> 37:35.561
It's Christmas, and-and people get lonely

37:35.606 --> 37:39.312
on Christmas, and we might do
something that we'd both regret, or

37:39.336 --> 37:43.891
could get in the way of a possibly
deeper relationship in the future.

37:44.316 --> 37:45.521
So...

37:47.486 --> 37:49.731
I'm... I'm sorry.

37:52.778 --> 37:56.760
Hey! Hey!
You stole my suit!

37:57.878 --> 37:59.422
Well, what about you?

38:00.377 --> 38:01.441
Me?

38:01.967 --> 38:05.671
Yes, where are you from?
What are you doing here?

38:05.777 --> 38:07.182
What's your damage?

38:07.405 --> 38:09.471
I spent a couple of years in the service.

38:09.627 --> 38:11.723
I managed to spend most
of my time in Okinawa,

38:11.778 --> 38:14.812
which is a hell of a lot better
than being in Iraq or Afghanistan.

38:15.938 --> 38:18.160
And since I've come back,
I've been working as a traveler.

38:18.175 --> 38:20.941
Yeah, I did that for a while,
but then I got tired of it.

38:20.977 --> 38:23.912
So, wait, you have what?
A week or so left?

38:23.978 --> 38:27.213
It's supposed to be a week,
but this place seems all right.

38:28.048 --> 38:29.782
Seems like pretty great people.

38:30.345 --> 38:33.583
I mean, like, what we did for that lady
today-- what you did--

38:34.005 --> 38:35.631
that was something.

38:35.906 --> 38:39.602
Come on, everyone deserves a little bit
of happiness at Christmas time.

38:45.548 --> 38:48.282
So I called the nursing director
and I signed on for another month.

38:49.407 --> 38:52.153
- Really?
- Really.

38:57.218 --> 38:58.980
Hmm. Well...

39:00.207 --> 39:02.023
Merry Christmas, Ben.

39:03.738 --> 39:05.383
Merry Christmas, Samantha.

41:50.846 --> 41:52.042
Idiot!

41:52.447 --> 41:54.181
Moron!

41:57.157 --> 42:00.441
She... she was right there,
right there for the fondling,

42:00.458 --> 42:03.210
and you just let her go.
Why? Why?!

42:03.447 --> 42:05.682
Why'd you have to be
such a good Christian?

42:07.277 --> 42:10.943
There's no, there's no God.
There's no Christmas.

42:11.837 --> 42:14.600
There is no frickin' Santa Claus!

42:22.976 --> 42:27.640
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Merry Christmas!

42:28.395 --> 42:29.852
Holy...

42:41.297 --> 42:46.303
