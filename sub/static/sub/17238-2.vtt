00:06.083 --> 00:09.959
-I gotta say, when Lisa first introduced the buddy bench,

00:06.083 --> 00:09.959
I was skeptical.

00:11.917 --> 00:14.500
-Well, if a kid doesn't have anyone to play with, he sits

00:11.917 --> 00:14.500
on the bench.

00:14.542 --> 00:16.875
And then, hopefully, someone will come along and be his

00:14.542 --> 00:16.875
buddy.

00:16.917 --> 00:19.166
-That's pretty brave of Charlie, sitting there by himself.

00:19.208 --> 00:21.333
-Yeah, and a little pathetic.

00:21.375 --> 00:23.792
Hey, Amanda Susan! Come here. : Yeah?

00:23.834 --> 00:26.583
He's all by himself.

00:29.875 --> 00:31.875
-Poor kid. I got this.

00:31.917 --> 00:34.291
-No, no, no, hold on a second.

00:34.333 --> 00:37.417
Mr. Duncan's got this. -Well, this is a nice surprise.

00:37.458 --> 00:40.291
-You guys are forgetting something. He's an idiot!

00:40.333 --> 00:42.208
-Give him a shot, give him a shot.

00:42.250 --> 00:44.792
: Wow! : See?

00:44.834 --> 00:46.834
-So naive.

00:47.959 --> 00:50.959
: Told ya. : That's cold.

00:52.917 --> 00:54.917
-Yeah. -Right.

00:58.667 --> 01:02.250
: Is it possible that we've misjudged this moron?

01:02.291 --> 01:04.250
: Keep watching.

01:04.291 --> 01:06.667
: There we go. : Nope.

01:10.417 --> 01:12.875
He's an idiot.

: Morning wifey. -Hi.

01:26.875 --> 01:28.417
-Thought I'd drop some things off before school.

01:28.458 --> 01:30.250
Do the move in stages. You get it, right?

01:30.291 --> 01:33.667
-Yeah, so... -Whoa, look at this!

01:35.875 --> 01:38.000
-We're married, Lisa. Married people live together.

01:38.041 --> 01:40.166
-I thought about you moving into our place.

01:40.208 --> 01:43.250
But, you had sex with Bill. So that's weird.

01:43.291 --> 01:45.834
And, Simon's there so it's a bit crowded.

01:45.875 --> 01:47.750
-My place it is then.

01:47.792 --> 01:49.917
-Oh, Bill and I like to watch the games all the time.

01:49.959 --> 01:52.083
So, I just brought that. Face the...

02:05.250 --> 02:08.125
Cats! Good news! You can get rid of your cats.

02:08.166 --> 02:10.291
-I'm not getting rid of my cats, Gerry.

02:10.333 --> 02:12.834
-You're not sad and alone anymore. Gerry's here.

02:12.875 --> 02:15.000
Okay

02:15.041 --> 02:17.458
-Okay, there is a small part of me that...

02:17.500 --> 02:20.166
: That really appreciates that, Gerry.

02:20.208 --> 02:22.792
-A big part of me is wondering, why would you have a couch

02:22.834 --> 02:25.792
in an angle, away...? -This is where the couch goes.

02:25.834 --> 02:28.709
-No! But...the... Let's move it.

02:28.750 --> 02:31.083
Let's move the couch. -I'm not moving my couch.

02:31.125 --> 02:34.709
-No, Lisa, I can't watch the TV. This is marriage, I'm sorry.

02:34.750 --> 02:37.291
Give and take. I'm taking...

02:37.333 --> 02:40.333
The couch in a position I need it. I watch a lot of sports.

02:40.375 --> 02:43.583
Hey!  Hey!

02:45.875 --> 02:48.875
-Cats like it straight. -There's pills to put them down.

02:48.917 --> 02:51.375
-Let's stop fighting,

02:48.917 --> 02:51.375
first of all.

02:51.417 --> 02:54.875
I don't want Bill to see this. Okay?

02:54.917 --> 02:57.041
Let's move the couch. Give and take.

02:57.083 --> 02:59.375
I will take the couch, this way. Ready? And...

02:59.417 --> 03:01.709
-Oh!

03:01.750 --> 03:04.125
You broke the couch, Gerry. -Oh, gosh Lisa.

03:04.166 --> 03:07.041
That's coming out of your money, 'cause I don't have money for

03:04.166 --> 03:07.041
that.

03:07.083 --> 03:09.709
-Oh SHUT UP!

03:12.834 --> 03:15.250
-What does it look like I'm

03:12.834 --> 03:15.250
doing?

03:15.291 --> 03:18.208
Adding five, maybe ten years to my life.

03:15.291 --> 03:18.208
-Seems selfish.

03:18.250 --> 03:21.583
And it's killing you all.

03:21.625 --> 03:24.417
-Yeah, something's definitely killing me Robert, but it's

03:21.625 --> 03:24.417
not sitting.

03:24.458 --> 03:27.667
'Cause I'm being productive and getting

03:24.458 --> 03:27.667
healthy at the same time?

03:27.709 --> 03:31.333
-Also, acting unprofessionally while looking disgusting.

03:31.375 --> 03:34.959
: My office, my rules.

03:31.375 --> 03:34.959
I don't...come in your As...

03:35.000 --> 03:37.500
: Robert. -...ton Martin and tell you

03:35.000 --> 03:37.500
how to drive.

03:37.542 --> 03:39.667
It's a good stress reliever, you should give it a whirl.

03:39.709 --> 03:42.834
That's what we're

03:39.709 --> 03:42.834
trying to prevent here.

03:45.250 --> 03:49.125
Excuse me, I think this is a donor...Hello!

03:53.625 --> 03:55.750
-Not being alone at the end.

03:55.792 --> 03:57.875
-Being able to double park during my morning pit stops.

03:57.917 --> 04:01.750
-Well, I don't understand why you couldn't just pick

03:57.917 --> 04:01.750
everything up from one place.

04:01.792 --> 04:04.417
Where is my stupid cell phone. -Because it's a routine!

04:04.458 --> 04:06.583
I always get my muffin from the muffin shop.

04:06.625 --> 04:08.750
I get my bagel from the bagel shop.

04:08.792 --> 04:10.917
You don't even want to know where I get my smoothie.

04:10.959 --> 04:13.083
-You got it from the smoothie shop.

04:10.959 --> 04:13.083
-Busted!

04:13.125 --> 04:16.125
-Your little pit stops, Gerry, are making us both late.

04:16.166 --> 04:19.208
-Don't worry about being late. I'm late all the time, no one

04:16.166 --> 04:19.208
even notices.

04:19.250 --> 04:22.625
He doesn't notice.

04:19.250 --> 04:22.625
Trust me.

04:22.667 --> 04:26.583
I walk by his office everyday. Hey, listen, don't tell him

04:22.667 --> 04:26.583
either, okay?

04:26.625 --> 04:29.125
That stays in the marriage vault. There's your phone.

04:29.166 --> 04:30.709
-Oh my God, I have...

04:32.125 --> 04:34.458
A conference call with the board in three minutes.

04:34.500 --> 04:37.250
Oh my God. Ugh!

04:38.041 --> 04:40.208
Ugh! Oh crap!

04:41.208 --> 04:43.750
Oof! Uuuurggghhh!

04:47.959 --> 04:50.750
: Ah, that's fast. : Outta my way,

04:47.959 --> 04:50.750
excuse me. : I'm the principal...Oh!

04:50.792 --> 04:53.583
-I gotta clean this up.

04:53.625 --> 04:58.667
This will take me half an hour.

04:53.625 --> 04:58.667
And there's the bell.

04:58.709 --> 05:00.875
-Oh, hey!

05:03.125 --> 05:06.875
-Oh, that's just the word that

05:03.125 --> 05:06.875
Eva used.

05:06.917 --> 05:10.083
-Oh, she's just an old

05:06.917 --> 05:10.083
student of mine.

05:10.125 --> 05:13.542
She just wrote me this beautiful letter.

05:10.125 --> 05:13.542
: Oh...

05:13.583 --> 05:18.166
-Basically thanking me for giving her and some other

05:13.583 --> 05:18.166
students a...

05:18.208 --> 05:22.917
Moving speech about how important it is to focus on

05:18.208 --> 05:22.917
your dreams.

05:22.959 --> 05:25.959
: Wow, great stuff. : Wow, isn't that nice.

05:22.959 --> 05:25.959
Cool.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.250
Stay with me for a second.

05:28.291 --> 05:31.125
It's actually...It's actually more than nice, because...

05:31.166 --> 05:34.000
Now she's like this accomplished singer and songwriter.

05:34.041 --> 05:36.917
And she's doing an album release concert tonight...

05:36.959 --> 05:39.583
And that...Is because of moi!

05:39.625 --> 05:42.250
-Wow! All because of you. -Yeah, wow!

05:42.291 --> 05:45.959
-Like, I made that happen... With my words.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.500
-It must have been some speech. -I mean, we forget...

05:48.542 --> 05:52.291
About the importance of our influence on these kids.

05:52.333 --> 05:55.208
And then you get something...

05:55.250 --> 05:57.709
-Oh, you're gonna cry. -You get something like this.

05:57.750 --> 05:59.875
: Oh. : Oh my goodness.

05:59.917 --> 06:02.041
-And you think this is why we do what we do.

06:02.083 --> 06:04.375
-Yes sir, that's exactly right. -That's the reason we do it.

06:04.417 --> 06:06.291
-And I'm gonna think about that. -Bye Bobbi.

06:06.333 --> 06:09.125
: Yeah, I'm just not quite finished.

06:06.333 --> 06:09.125
: Okay, not done.

06:09.166 --> 06:12.458
-I'm just wondering, have you guys ever got a letter like

06:09.166 --> 06:12.458
this

06:12.500 --> 06:15.417
I haven't, but...

06:15.458 --> 06:17.667
: Yeah.

06:17.709 --> 06:20.208
: Probably not.

06:21.166 --> 06:23.083
-Maybe one day.

06:25.917 --> 06:28.291
-I need to talk to you about me teaching Phys Ed.

06:28.333 --> 06:30.417
-No.

06:30.458 --> 06:33.750
-As my boss, and more importantly my wife, you need

06:30.458 --> 06:33.750
to look after your teachers...

06:33.792 --> 06:35.959
And your husband.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.375
-'Cause a happy husband is a happy life-band.

06:39.417 --> 06:41.542
-Okay... -Great! I'll tell Bobbi.

06:41.583 --> 06:44.542
-No. I mean, okay...I...

06:44.583 --> 06:47.083
This marriage is not working for me.

06:47.125 --> 06:49.375
-I mean, we've given it a whirl.

06:49.417 --> 06:52.709
We've gone around that merry-go-round...Twice.

06:52.750 --> 06:56.083
And we are clearly, horribly...

06:56.125 --> 06:59.291
Murderously incompatible. -Okay, agree to disagree.

06:59.333 --> 07:01.792
But, just don't let the moment get you all upset.

07:01.834 --> 07:04.667
-I want an annulment. Another one.

07:05.500 --> 07:07.375
-Well, I shoulda seen that coming.

07:07.417 --> 07:09.834
'Cause you slept with all my friends before we got married.

07:09.875 --> 07:12.000
: Okay... -If that wasn't a sign of a

07:09.875 --> 07:12.000
problem...  Bill's your only

07:12.041 --> 07:14.166
friend?

07:14.208 --> 07:17.917
-You don't get to hurt me anymore. That's how that

07:14.208 --> 07:17.917
works, Missy.

07:20.166 --> 07:22.542
-Get out Gerry. -Later. We'll talk later.

07:22.583 --> 07:24.959
-Bye.

07:28.125 --> 07:30.250
-One minute I'm married, the next minute I'm not.

07:30.291 --> 07:33.375
-Gerry, sometimes marriages end and we don't know why.

07:33.417 --> 07:35.834
In this case, of course, it's obvious.

07:35.875 --> 07:38.000
The odds of it working out were really low.

07:38.041 --> 07:41.125
-She was a very different girl the second time we got married.

07:41.166 --> 07:43.291
-Let me ask you this. -Anything.

07:48.417 --> 07:50.625
To be honest, I don't really know.

07:50.667 --> 07:54.083
Um, we woke up a couple times in bed together.

07:54.125 --> 07:56.083
We may or may not have had relations the first time.

07:56.125 --> 07:58.834
The second time we did not. So, things are definitely

07:56.125 --> 07:58.834
getting worse.

07:58.875 --> 08:02.333
Think, Gerry.

07:58.875 --> 08:02.333
Any little detail can help.

08:02.375 --> 08:05.667
-No, I think I've told you everything. That's pretty

08:02.375 --> 08:05.667
much...

08:05.709 --> 08:08.166
Or a toy?

08:08.208 --> 08:10.959
Or like a sexy little birthmark that I can think about or...

08:11.000 --> 08:14.166
Like anything at all would help. A trigger Come on.

08:14.208 --> 08:16.125
: Ahhh. -Anything, anything.

08:16.166 --> 08:18.917
-Maybe this was a bad idea, Frank. I think I'm gonna go.

08:18.959 --> 08:22.125
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. I got a little greedy there. Mea culpa.

08:22.166 --> 08:25.083
But you want some real talksies? -Yes, that's why I'm here.

08:25.125 --> 08:27.291
-Every little girl dreams about her wedding.

08:27.333 --> 08:30.625
And our Lisa has had two of them, and the drunken lush

08:27.333 --> 08:30.625
can't remember either.

08:30.667 --> 08:33.417
-You can't say that. Technically, she's still my

08:30.667 --> 08:33.417
wife you're talking about.

08:33.458 --> 08:37.250
-And she's my boss. She's also a lady who used to be a little

08:33.458 --> 08:37.250
dream filled girl.

08:37.291 --> 08:40.542
And a person. If you want to stay married, you've got to do

08:37.291 --> 08:40.542
this right.

08:40.583 --> 08:43.041
-Wow! You're good.

08:43.083 --> 08:45.709
I never looked at it that way.

08:45.750 --> 08:48.208
-I'm not just a guidance counsellor, I'm also...

08:48.250 --> 08:51.083
-My friend and I appreciate it. You don't have to remind me.

08:51.125 --> 08:56.709
-I was going to say a licensed sexual surrogate, but thank you.

08:56.750 --> 08:59.375
-I've got, like, a special

08:56.750 --> 08:59.375
skill.

08:59.417 --> 09:03.041
-Yeah. -I can satisfy women without

08:59.417 --> 09:03.041
them falling in love with me.

09:03.083 --> 09:04.917
-Right.

09:04.959 --> 09:08.208
-So, we can put a smile on her face and a ring on her finger

09:04.959 --> 09:08.208
as a team.

09:08.250 --> 09:12.208
-I'm gonna go... And I'm gonna erase that...

09:12.250 --> 09:14.291
From my memory, okay?

09:16.166 --> 09:18.959
: If you're a bad boy again...

09:19.000 --> 09:21.792
I'm going to get off... This treadmill.

09:21.834 --> 09:24.542
To drag you to detention...

09:24.583 --> 09:27.625
Myself!

09:32.125 --> 09:35.083
: Um...Robert! What...?

09:35.959 --> 09:38.125
What the hell is this business?

09:38.166 --> 09:41.625
-I kept sweating through my daywear, so I thought I'd slip

09:38.166 --> 09:41.625
into something a bit more...

09:41.667 --> 09:43.792
Appropriate.

09:43.834 --> 09:46.500
-There is nothing appropriate about this.

09:46.542 --> 09:52.333
-Did it ever occur to you that you might be sending the wrong

09:46.542 --> 09:52.333
message to the students?

09:52.375 --> 09:55.208
-Pft! Did it ever occur to you that I might be leading by

09:52.375 --> 09:55.208
example?

09:55.250 --> 09:58.208
Teaching them about living with an active lifestyle.

15:46.417 --> 15:48.875

Oh man! Ugh! That was gross.

15:52.709 --> 15:56.500
Wow, I was enjoying being married, not to you, but...

15:56.542 --> 15:59.458
I had crossed off my bucket list item.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.500
-I was really liking having human friends.

16:03.291 --> 16:06.166
Why do we have to be married the conventional

16:03.291 --> 16:06.166
way?

16:06.208 --> 16:08.250
Why can't we be married our own way?

16:08.291 --> 16:11.834
Keep the good stuff, lose the gross stuff like having to lie

16:08.291 --> 16:11.834
in bed next to you.

16:11.875 --> 16:15.417
-I'm listening. -There's no rule that you have

16:11.875 --> 16:15.417
to live in the same place

16:15.458 --> 16:17.667
and sleep in the same bed with your wife.

16:17.709 --> 16:21.250
-Yeah. That's a fabricated societal construct is what

16:17.709 --> 16:21.250
that is.

16:21.291 --> 16:25.291
-I don't know what that means, but, why can't we just stay

16:21.291 --> 16:25.291
married for our own benefit?

16:25.333 --> 16:28.083
-No reason. -You don't want to live with me,

16:25.333 --> 16:28.083
I don't want to live with you.

16:28.125 --> 16:31.417
-No argument here. -Oh my god, marriage

16:28.125 --> 16:31.417
without commitment.

16:31.458 --> 16:34.667
That's the best! -Sounds amazing! It's perfect.

16:34.709 --> 16:38.583
-We're a great team. -We are such a good team, aww.

16:38.625 --> 16:41.041
-People will be jealous of our marriage.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.375
-Get out Gerry. -Alright, gladly.

16:43.417 --> 16:46.542
: Get the hell out of here.

16:51.250 --> 16:53.667
-I really think you're reading too much into these lyrics.

16:53.709 --> 16:55.583
: Yeah? -Yeah.

16:57.834 --> 17:01.458
What's one bad white supremacist apple in like...

16:57.834 --> 17:01.458
: Mmmm.

17:01.500 --> 17:05.250
-An orchard of race loving...

17:05.291 --> 17:08.458
Open-minded mixed fruit.

17:08.500 --> 17:10.625
-Mixed fruit. -Yes.

17:10.667 --> 17:12.917
-I was thinking the exact same thing.

17:10.667 --> 17:12.917
: There you go.

17:12.959 --> 17:16.667
-So, I tracked down a couple of people that were there the day

17:12.959 --> 17:16.667
I made the speech to Eva.

17:16.709 --> 17:19.500
-And I'm sure that they are upstanding members of society.

17:19.542 --> 17:22.542
-One's a prostitute and the other one's a drug dealer.

17:25.333 --> 17:27.291
-I don't remember.

17:27.333 --> 17:30.208
And remember, 'cause I don't want to have to tell you

17:27.333 --> 17:30.208
girls this again.

17:30.250 --> 17:34.041
You need to change your attitudes, focus on what

17:30.250 --> 17:34.041
matters.

17:34.083 --> 17:37.125
Focus on your future! God, you have dreams, don't you?

17:37.166 --> 17:40.458
Well, the way you guys are playing it right now, all those

17:37.166 --> 17:40.458
dreams? Just say goodbye.

17:40.500 --> 17:44.875
Goodbye to everything that's in your future because you have

17:40.500 --> 17:44.875
such a huge attitude problem!

17:44.917 --> 17:47.041
What?

17:47.083 --> 17:49.750
-I was reading this article. Did know that drug dealers,

17:47.083 --> 17:49.750
prostitutes and

17:49.792 --> 17:52.875
white supremacist singer/ songwriters make more money

17:49.792 --> 17:52.875
than teachers do?

17:52.917 --> 17:56.583
-That's unbelievable. -Just thought I'd let you know,

17:52.917 --> 17:56.583
so...Hey girls.

17:58.166 --> 18:03.208
-Oh! Yup, yup. There it is. Now I remember.

18:03.250 --> 18:06.208
-Hi, this is Ms. Walsh from Xavier Academy.

18:06.250 --> 18:08.375
I'm calling to remind you that...

18:08.417 --> 18:11.500
: That's the stuff buddy.

18:08.417 --> 18:11.500
You're in the pocket now.

18:11.542 --> 18:13.625
: Sorry.

18:13.667 --> 18:16.041
: Man my quads are tight. Feel that deep burn.

18:16.083 --> 18:19.500
: I'm gonna have to call you back.

18:19.542 --> 18:22.333
Check me out, Trudy! I'm getting lots of work done.

18:22.375 --> 18:24.542
My stress levels are way down!

18:24.583 --> 18:27.083
You should totally get one of these.

18:45.917 --> 18:48.083
-Y'know, you're right about the treadmill.

18:48.125 --> 18:50.375
Big stress reliever.

18:56.041 --> 18:59.750
-Hey Gerry! So I'm collecting donations to end poverty.

18:59.792 --> 19:02.291
Which is like really, obviously super bad!

19:02.333 --> 19:05.417
And I was wondering if you would be willing to open

19:02.333 --> 19:05.417
your heart...

19:05.458 --> 19:07.875
And your wallet. -Let me stop you right there.

19:07.917 --> 19:10.792
-Yup. -If it was up to me I'd give

19:07.917 --> 19:10.792
you every cent I have.

19:10.834 --> 19:13.375
But I'm married, so I gotta check with Lisa.

19:13.417 --> 19:15.542
'Cause we do everything together.

19:15.583 --> 19:18.500
We discuss finances, so... -Yeah, that's cool.

19:18.542 --> 19:20.709
-So, if you can get Lisa on board, I'm on board.

19:20.750 --> 19:23.834
Check with her, okay? -Okay, I get it. That's cool.

19:23.875 --> 19:26.625
-Yeah, I know about that.

19:28.333 --> 19:30.625
-Hey Lisa! -Hey.

19:30.667 --> 19:36.250
-Hey, so I am collecting donations to end all of...

19:36.291 --> 19:38.083
Poverty! Just all of it.

19:38.125 --> 19:41.375
I was hoping that you would open your heart and your wallet...

19:41.417 --> 19:45.083
-Ooh, I would just love to, but I'm married now.

19:45.125 --> 19:48.417
So I can't dip into the finances without checking with my hubby.

19:48.458 --> 19:51.250
-Okay, well...

19:51.291 --> 19:53.166
He just said the same thing about you, so...

19:53.208 --> 19:56.458
-'Cause we're married. It's a married thing so...

19:53.208 --> 19:56.458
She doesn't get it.

19:58.709 --> 20:01.000
Go on! Git!

20:03.500 --> 20:06.875
-Funny little spinster. -Oh, she needs cats.

20:16.291 --> 20:18.083
-Hey! There he is! -Surprise!

20:18.125 --> 20:20.917
-We figured since we didn't

20:18.125 --> 20:20.917
celebrate your marriage...

20:20.959 --> 20:24.166
We put together a little... -Breakfast Bachelor Party!

20:24.208 --> 20:26.709
-Boom! -Wow! That's awesome!

20:28.583 --> 20:30.917
Who's sleeping on the couch?

20:30.959 --> 20:33.166
-Bill got you a stripper! -A str...!

20:33.208 --> 20:36.125
-She was working a nightshift though, so she's taking a

20:33.208 --> 20:36.125
quick power nap, sleep it off.

20:36.166 --> 20:39.542
-I can't have a stripper. I'm married now, I can't be...

20:39.583 --> 20:41.709
-You're married to someone you don't live with, so...

20:41.750 --> 20:44.125
Is that really a marriage

20:44.166 --> 20:46.125
-Yes, it is, because...2016!

20:46.166 --> 20:48.291
-That's a good point. -Yeah, that's a fair point.

20:48.333 --> 20:50.917
-If it's good enough for the country, it's good enough

20:48.333 --> 20:50.917
for me.

20:50.959 --> 20:53.208
: What

20:50.959 --> 20:53.208
do you want me to do?

20:53.250 --> 20:55.959
You want me to get rid of her? -No, let her sleep.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.917
-Let her sleep, let her sleep that's good. That's nice, man.

20:58.959 --> 21:01.083
: Just keep it down, we'll have the bachelor party.

21:01.125 --> 21:03.834
: Yeah! -But we'll let the stripper
