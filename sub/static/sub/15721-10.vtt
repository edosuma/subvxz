00:00.160 --> 00:02.907
- Where are you?
- In Michigan. I found her.

00:03.184 --> 00:04.797
I found... Nina.

00:04.917 --> 00:07.429
Wait a minute. Are you telling me
that you had this procedure done?

00:07.549 --> 00:09.133
I have a heightened sense of empathy.

00:10.587 --> 00:11.991
What happened here?

00:12.111 --> 00:13.887
The second stage primate trials.

00:14.048 --> 00:16.391
Injected with my stem cells.

00:16.551 --> 00:18.143
They did this to themselves.

00:18.611 --> 00:19.686
Oh, my God.

00:20.041 --> 00:22.664
I spent the evening with Enuka Okimba.

00:23.016 --> 00:25.692
- You know Enuka?
- Hottest virologist in the US.

00:25.852 --> 00:27.110
Quite the reputation.

00:27.270 --> 00:29.446
I was referring to her science.

00:29.566 --> 00:30.613
Yes, so was I.

00:32.116 --> 00:33.407
What do you want?

00:35.206 --> 00:36.262
Wes' job.

00:38.022 --> 00:38.871
Done.

00:39.335 --> 00:41.457
I love you, David Sandström!

00:42.361 --> 00:43.739
Something's wrong.

00:44.272 --> 00:45.461
What's going on here?

00:45.622 --> 00:47.129
Get back to your work!

00:47.932 --> 00:50.404
- What are we making?
- Weaponized measles.

00:50.524 --> 00:52.634
- Stop it! Stop!
- Your password.

00:52.795 --> 00:53.739
Showtime.

00:55.048 --> 00:55.848
You.

00:56.382 --> 00:59.183
- Is this the real thing? Take it.
- No!

01:06.879 --> 01:08.268
<i>Ms. Tran, line 2.</i>

01:08.887 --> 01:10.410
Hello? Yeah, hi.

01:10.620 --> 01:13.026
I had a chance to look at your CV.

01:13.274 --> 01:15.343
No, Dr. Sandström hasn't seen it yet.

01:15.590 --> 01:17.785
Believe me,
hiring a virologist is a priority,

01:17.946 --> 01:20.737
but he's not ready
to do any interviews this week...

01:20.857 --> 01:21.789
That's right.

01:21.950 --> 01:24.166
I see that you did your graduate work
with Jim Smiley,

01:24.286 --> 01:26.001
and your post-doc at NIH?

01:26.331 --> 01:28.817
Yeah, a few of them.
I liked your article in Nature,

01:28.937 --> 01:30.831
the HIV Infection angle
of preventing MS.

01:30.951 --> 01:33.410
It's on the edge,
exactly where David likes to be.

01:33.530 --> 01:35.444
<i>Ms. Tran, line 3 is still holding.</i>

01:35.564 --> 01:39.109
You're definitely on the short list.
The rest is just up to David. Okay?

01:39.229 --> 01:40.307
Great, bye.

01:43.945 --> 01:46.676
<i>Ms. Tran,
lines 2 and 3 are still holding.</i>

01:46.796 --> 01:50.145

01:58.833 --> 01:59.786
<i>Ms. Tran?</i>

02:01.112 --> 02:03.850
Yeah, can you tell them
that I'm in a meeting, please?

02:03.970 --> 02:05.018
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

02:07.578 --> 02:08.460

02:37.900 --> 02:39.324
You look a little rough.

02:40.147 --> 02:42.067
It's been a rough couple of years.

02:42.280 --> 02:43.266
Come on in.

02:45.642 --> 02:47.249
So was that message of yours serious?

02:48.511 --> 02:49.655
Of course.

02:50.880 --> 02:53.636
You realize
I don't always play by the book.

02:53.852 --> 02:56.486
- Why should you?
- And I hate authority figures.

02:56.606 --> 02:58.982
I got my first detention
in kindergarten.

03:00.458 --> 03:02.589
I don't mind sleeping with the boss.

03:04.295 --> 03:05.309
Fine by me.

03:05.872 --> 03:07.829
Then I accept your job offer.

03:14.312 --> 03:16.535
Once we've discussed my salary.

03:22.018 --> 03:24.051
Have you got any beer left?

03:26.207 --> 03:27.759
Let me take your coat.

03:29.336 --> 03:31.087
Your test results came in.

03:31.788 --> 03:33.842
And keep in mind they're just...

03:33.962 --> 03:37.299
- preliminary, exploratory tests.
- Please just tell me.

03:39.306 --> 03:41.094
You have elevated dopamine levels.

03:42.019 --> 03:43.221
Have you been feeling

03:43.382 --> 03:44.295
anxious,

03:44.675 --> 03:45.795
paranoid...?

03:46.310 --> 03:47.160
No.

03:48.151 --> 03:49.269
Are you sure?

03:50.200 --> 03:51.750
Bob. I'm fine.

03:53.522 --> 03:54.223
But...

03:55.105 --> 03:58.010
I saw those monkeys too.
I know what may be coming.

03:59.187 --> 03:59.947
So?

04:01.266 --> 04:02.047
Well,

04:02.167 --> 04:04.373
the herpes virus is still hidden.

04:04.914 --> 04:06.995
We just need to treat it.

04:08.617 --> 04:09.957
I wish it were that easy.

04:21.692 --> 04:23.169
Nina, look at this.

04:27.730 --> 04:29.018
It's overdone.

04:40.050 --> 04:41.029
It's perfect.

04:53.202 --> 04:54.292
Is something wrong?

04:56.788 --> 04:58.922
I'm just glad it's not overdone.

Just got it in last year.
It's an amazing machine.

06:42.095 --> 06:43.133
It's great.

06:43.474 --> 06:46.472
Finally,
your new home away from home.

06:47.301 --> 06:49.825
I hope it meets with your standards.

06:50.332 --> 06:51.615
That's the tour.

06:52.238 --> 06:53.617
Welcome to NorBAC.

06:54.177 --> 06:55.996
Thanks, David. This is fantastic.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.814
Yeah, it's pretty great, eh?

06:57.934 --> 07:00.792
If there's anything else you need,
you just let me know.

07:04.428 --> 07:05.507
Are you all right?

07:17.942 --> 07:19.558
<i>David, we cannot do this.</i>

07:20.349 --> 07:21.481
<i>We can't cooperate.</i>

07:33.571 --> 07:35.120
I don't fucking want to do this

07:35.562 --> 07:37.539
and I don't fucking need to do this!

07:40.478 --> 07:42.142
Then why are you here?

07:42.954 --> 07:46.047
Contractual obligation,
company rules, whatever...

07:46.417 --> 07:48.936
lets you cash your cheque
with a clear conscience.

07:49.056 --> 07:50.051
Look, I...

07:51.628 --> 07:53.399
I just need...

07:53.614 --> 07:55.493
some time alone, that's all.

07:59.668 --> 08:00.812
Are you drinking?

08:02.439 --> 08:03.899
Not nearly enough.

08:04.973 --> 08:06.455
David, you all right?

08:07.099 --> 08:08.204
Rachel's?

08:08.324 --> 08:09.825
It's 17 days.

08:21.866 --> 08:22.929
Shit.

08:27.757 --> 08:31.631
If it would be easier, I could tidy
her belongings away, if you like.

08:32.897 --> 08:34.799
My history. I'll take care of it.

08:35.706 --> 08:36.686
Thanks.

08:46.962 --> 08:49.881
I know we haven't talked about this
in a while, but now we've...

08:50.001 --> 08:51.029
re-staffed...

08:53.283 --> 08:55.913
I met Rachel several times
over the years.

08:56.636 --> 08:58.538
She was an amazing person.

09:01.765 --> 09:04.440
<i>- Get the fuck out!
- I'm a doctor! Let me attend to her!</i>

09:06.115 --> 09:08.088
All I see, all that I want to do

09:08.249 --> 09:11.933
is grab one of those sons-of-bitches
and toss him through a wall!

09:12.825 --> 09:14.469
For what they did to her,

09:15.021 --> 09:17.389
it was not fair
that they be killed quickly.

09:17.550 --> 09:19.849
I feel like
I was robbed of an opportunity.

09:20.136 --> 09:21.438
To inflict pain?

09:21.558 --> 09:22.352
Yes.

09:23.199 --> 09:26.690
Yes. To make them suffer
the way I do, except far worse.

09:27.625 --> 09:29.192
Can you picture living with that?

09:29.961 --> 09:32.157
If you were given the opportunity?

09:33.597 --> 09:34.646
Yes, I can.

09:38.169 --> 09:40.463
That's what gets me through the day.

09:41.909 --> 09:44.407
Consider this a homework assignment,
reschedule this

09:44.527 --> 09:46.909
around our current investigations,
but we have to figure out

09:47.029 --> 09:49.625
- what happened at Roth's lab.
- The dead monkeys?

09:49.745 --> 09:53.522
The macaques were supposed to become
peaceful, cooperative, empathetic.

09:53.642 --> 09:55.124
Instead they went apeshit

09:55.244 --> 09:57.509
and tore each other apart.
Killed their keeper.

09:57.629 --> 09:59.513
And what Roth manipulated
in the monkeys,

09:59.633 --> 10:01.406
- he first did to you.
- Not exactly.

10:01.635 --> 10:05.309
We were trying to re-establish Bob's
eyesight using an experimental protocol.

10:05.429 --> 10:07.984
Yeah. I was trying.
It was my bright idea.

10:08.104 --> 10:10.627
The delivery system, a herpes virus,

10:10.747 --> 10:13.891
was to deliver a growth factor
to my optic nerve.

10:14.011 --> 10:17.726
But instead it took a billion-to-one
side trip to Bob's Jacobson's Organ.

10:18.313 --> 10:22.071
The chemosensory organ
located behind the nose.

10:22.391 --> 10:25.749
It's sensitive to chemical signals
between animals.

10:26.132 --> 10:28.251
In the lower orders,
it's like telepathy.

10:28.551 --> 10:30.912
- But dormant in humans.
- Until now.

10:31.032 --> 10:33.959
In a higher order like Bob,
you get empathy.

10:34.183 --> 10:37.344
He's annoyingly sensitive
to other people's emotions.

10:37.505 --> 10:40.241
Fear, despair, anger...
it's overwhelming at times.

10:40.361 --> 10:42.012
What about joy or love?

10:42.691 --> 10:44.309
Also overwhelming.

10:45.121 --> 10:47.198
If it weren't for Bob's
Asperger's syndrome,

10:47.431 --> 10:49.271
it would probably send him
over the deep end.

10:49.391 --> 10:51.442
- Before Roth kidnapped Bob...
- I went willingly.

10:52.116 --> 10:54.479
Yeah. We were trying to turn off
the herpes virus

10:54.599 --> 10:56.989
with an antiviral: acyclovir.

10:57.289 --> 10:59.700
- I gather it didn't work.
- Another mystery worth investigating.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.535
Our best guess is that the viral DNA

11:01.695 --> 11:04.037
somehow inserted
itself in Bob's cellular DNA.

11:04.198 --> 11:06.391
But if Bob's fine
and the test primates are dead,

11:06.511 --> 11:09.216
- why are we taking a look at this?
- Nina.

11:10.504 --> 11:11.544
My <i>fiancée</i>.

11:12.090 --> 11:13.696
Roth's human guinea pig.

11:14.223 --> 11:15.784
Willingly, David.

11:16.483 --> 11:20.755
If humans follow the same timeline
as the monkeys, in a week, possibly two,

11:20.875 --> 11:23.958
Nina may begin to experience
the same violent tendencies.

11:25.033 --> 11:27.927
So this is a little more serious
than homework.

11:29.545 --> 11:31.356
Bob, how is Nina doing?

11:32.326 --> 11:33.381
She's fine.

11:34.270 --> 11:36.760
She seems a little preoccupied at times.

11:37.112 --> 11:39.186
All this waiting. All these tests...

11:39.306 --> 11:41.337
Did she experience
the same empathy effect?

11:41.457 --> 11:44.003
Yes, she did.
See, Mr. Roth believed that if we felt

11:44.242 --> 11:47.747
each other's emotions as our own,
then we could eliminate war,

11:47.908 --> 11:49.229
greed, murder.

11:51.166 --> 11:52.899
A revolution through compassion.

11:53.019 --> 11:56.172
But Roth rushed the science,
which was questionable to begin with.

11:56.333 --> 11:58.351
We experimented and found
the number of cells

11:58.471 --> 12:00.886
and delivery protocols
The monkeys' behaviour changed.

12:01.046 --> 12:03.355
Aggression declined,
cooperation increased.

12:03.475 --> 12:05.140
And then it all went to Hell, Bob.

12:06.576 --> 12:09.761
People, we gotta figure out a way
to turn off Nina's Jacobson's Organ.

12:09.881 --> 12:12.355
First prize: you get to be emcee
at Bob's wedding.

12:16.641 --> 12:18.235
Welcome.
Excuse me.

12:21.436 --> 12:23.015
Hey, sorry I'm late.

12:24.863 --> 12:26.515
What's going on?

12:26.955 --> 12:29.386
We were just filling Enuka in
on Nina's situation.

12:29.506 --> 12:31.354
Yeah, I got that e-mail.

12:31.474 --> 12:32.534
Mayko Tran,

12:32.654 --> 12:35.149
Enuka Okimba,
our new virologist.

12:37.145 --> 12:39.757
You mean the new virologist
who wasn't cleared by security?

12:40.373 --> 12:42.496
The new virologist
who didn't have to be vetted

12:42.616 --> 12:44.387
by any of our 3 governing bodies?

12:45.018 --> 12:46.068
Excuse me...

12:47.277 --> 12:48.972
It was nice to meet you.

12:52.522 --> 12:54.760
I think I know
what we need in lab personnel.

12:54.989 --> 12:57.358
This is so typical of you, David.

12:57.791 --> 13:00.696
You can never keep your personal life
separate from your professional life

13:00.856 --> 13:03.513
and then you leave the rest of us
picking up the pieces.

13:06.050 --> 13:07.626
Who the fuck are you?

13:11.348 --> 13:12.526
Enuka Okimba.

13:13.129 --> 13:14.952
Our new virologist.

13:16.546 --> 13:18.816
She's competent, outgoing,

13:19.375 --> 13:22.416
and I'm sure she has all the qualities
that NorBAC needs,

13:22.968 --> 13:25.094
and I feel horrible
for saying this, but...

13:25.214 --> 13:26.659
She's not Rachel.

13:29.908 --> 13:30.921
I'm sorry.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.066
I miss her.

13:37.259 --> 13:38.402
I know you do.

13:39.561 --> 13:41.594
<i>I thought you weren't back
till tomorrow!</i>

13:47.986 --> 13:48.743
You.

13:48.904 --> 13:50.538
- Test it on me!
- Come.

13:51.006 --> 13:52.620
- Test it on me!
- No.

13:53.367 --> 13:54.167
Her.

13:54.656 --> 13:55.887
- Come.
- Wait!

13:57.049 --> 13:58.847
<i>But you feel partly
to blame for her death?</i>

14:00.898 --> 14:03.371
Rachel wouldn't want me believing that.

14:03.769 --> 14:07.419
She was an understanding person,
an amazing scientist and...

14:07.539 --> 14:08.743
a good friend.

14:10.883 --> 14:11.925
And yet...?

14:14.770 --> 14:16.601
I'm not hiding any guilt.

14:17.116 --> 14:19.471
I know that terrible things
happen every day.

14:19.591 --> 14:23.570
Human beings inflict as much pain
and death as any other predator species.

14:24.698 --> 14:28.180
I don't mean to sound dismissive.
In fact I find myself thinking what

14:28.300 --> 14:30.660
she must have been
thinking at that moment.

14:31.414 --> 14:33.367
Hearing the trigger squeezed,

14:33.968 --> 14:35.018
thinking...

14:36.352 --> 14:37.302
"Why me?"

14:41.118 --> 14:42.506
And then nothing.

14:56.091 --> 14:58.313
What are you feeling so guilty about?

14:59.792 --> 15:02.598
We never should have gone
through with this.

15:02.926 --> 15:04.986
But I let Mr. Roth convince me.

15:05.536 --> 15:06.285
No.

15:06.699 --> 15:09.189
You let me convince you. I wanted this.

15:11.006 --> 15:11.826
Listen.

15:12.084 --> 15:14.404
Baby, I'm one of those people, okay?

15:14.524 --> 15:16.914
When the spaceship lands,
I want on board.

15:19.459 --> 15:22.213
This was my chance to enter a new world,

15:22.333 --> 15:24.212
and I got to be there with you.

15:24.765 --> 15:25.612
Bonus.

15:32.106 --> 15:34.625
You're worried about me.

15:35.050 --> 15:38.243
You can't keep blaming yourself,
because I don't.

15:39.340 --> 15:41.286
You're still feeling guilty.

15:41.836 --> 15:42.690
I'm not.

15:43.693 --> 15:46.072
I am not feeling guilty.

15:48.175 --> 15:49.089
Stop it.

15:50.040 --> 15:50.942
Come here.

16:51.634 --> 16:53.845
- Where are you going?
- I've got a lunch across town.

16:54.130 --> 16:55.279
Yeah? With who?

16:55.399 --> 16:58.965
A potential virologist
I was going to pre-interview for you.

17:04.038 --> 17:06.357
I reviewed a study by Andrews and Maron,
where they thought

17:06.478 --> 17:10.103
they saw herpes simplex integrate into
chromosome 11, but no one believed it.

17:10.223 --> 17:14.173
- They could only detect by FISH.
- Run the experiment past Bob,

17:14.292 --> 17:16.318
he's really good
at finding holes in things.

17:16.438 --> 17:19.198
Of course it's almost impossible to ID
the virus and see if it's replicating

17:19.318 --> 17:21.839
without a slice of Nina's brain.
That's too bad.

17:24.157 --> 17:26.411
- You know what I mean.
- I know what you mean.

17:26.531 --> 17:28.743
Would a slice of monkey brain do?

17:30.290 --> 17:31.722
You brought back samples?

17:51.501 --> 17:54.225
- Where are you going?
- I've got a lunch across town.

17:54.345 --> 17:55.558
Yeah? With who?

17:55.830 --> 17:59.387
A potential virologist
I was going to pre-interview for you.

18:19.325 --> 18:20.338
Ms. Tran?

18:21.125 --> 18:22.327
Ms. Tran.

18:22.447 --> 18:24.660
Please.
Our daughter has aplastic anaemia.

18:24.780 --> 18:26.996
Her bone marrow doesn't work.
She's dying.

18:27.116 --> 18:29.066
Please, just read this report.

18:29.427 --> 18:31.108
She's only 6 years old.

18:31.862 --> 18:33.528
We have nowhere else to go.

18:49.453 --> 18:51.153
- Got a minute?
- Sure.

18:53.501 --> 18:56.126
What do you know about aplastic anaemia?

19:11.418 --> 19:14.569
She's deteriorating rapidly.
Red blood cells are borderline,

19:14.730 --> 19:16.988
and white blood cells
and platelets are down.

19:18.744 --> 19:21.516
Bone marrow transplants
are really painful, right?

19:21.894 --> 19:23.274
They can be, yeah.

19:24.328 --> 19:26.414
The marrow is irradiated
to kill all the cells

19:26.575 --> 19:30.985
and the immune system is suppressed
before the donor cells are introduced.

19:32.484 --> 19:35.214
Some patients
never survive the procedure.

19:37.476 --> 19:39.117
How do you know the family?

19:40.242 --> 19:43.828
And then after that,
the new marrow is transplanted.

19:43.948 --> 19:47.367
That's only if it's a very close
HLA match, which is quite rare.

19:47.554 --> 19:51.542
Usually, best chance is with a sibling,
even then, it's only a 35% probability.

19:52.067 --> 19:53.708
Remember that case,

19:54.151 --> 19:56.140
they made test-tube babies
to create donors?

19:56.260 --> 19:58.820
That's unsubstantiated science fiction.

20:03.856 --> 20:05.028
It's genetic?

20:05.907 --> 20:07.008
Sometimes.

20:12.516 --> 20:14.086
Do you think she looks like me?

20:19.008 --> 20:20.883
Yeah, her eyes... her smile.

20:23.087 --> 20:24.915
When is the last time you saw her?

20:26.180 --> 20:27.962
The day after she was born.

20:29.110 --> 20:30.821
She was so tiny...

20:31.665 --> 20:33.094
It must have been...

20:33.469 --> 20:34.876
a hard decision.

20:36.704 --> 20:38.274
Not as hard as you'd think.

20:38.567 --> 20:40.988
Well, even though it's a slim chance,

20:41.191 --> 20:43.373
you should contact the father and...

20:43.819 --> 20:45.826
have him tested to see if he's a match.

20:46.286 --> 20:47.997
Are you still in touch with him?

20:52.919 --> 20:53.786
Well,

20:54.395 --> 20:56.963
maybe you'll have the chance
to give her life twice.

20:57.536 --> 20:59.598
It only takes a blood test to find out.

21:11.195 --> 21:12.508
Sorry I'm late.

21:42.007 --> 21:42.968
Nina?

21:53.843 --> 21:54.895
Did I wake you?

21:56.421 --> 21:57.945
- No!
- Nina!

22:05.586 --> 22:06.907
It's happening.

22:17.540 --> 22:19.086
Louis settling down okay?

22:19.345 --> 22:21.009
He pissed in my kitchen.

22:21.266 --> 22:23.329
You must be making him nervous.

22:23.962 --> 22:25.929
You find a place to board him yet?

22:26.049 --> 22:28.344
David, he's just not good in kennels.

22:28.464 --> 22:30.960
He hates other dogs. He's a people dog.

22:31.140 --> 22:32.389
He likes you.

22:32.509 --> 22:34.116
David, are you busy?

22:37.970 --> 22:39.701
There might be a way to differentiate

22:39.821 --> 22:42.517
between Bob's stem cells and Nina's,
and if we could do that,

22:42.637 --> 22:45.141
we could open up a way of exploring
different treatment options.

22:45.261 --> 22:46.191
Any luck?

22:46.369 --> 22:48.360
I tried retinoic acid,
nerve growth factor,

22:48.480 --> 22:50.552
brain-derived neurotropic factor...

22:50.823 --> 22:51.626
Nothing.

22:51.746 --> 22:54.250
Bob's cells would have divided,
specialized by now,

22:54.370 --> 22:55.757
it's bound to be a maze.

22:58.347 --> 22:59.729
Maybe titrate up?

23:00.177 --> 23:03.459
<i>- We overpower him...
- I prefer not to anger armed men.</i>

23:03.579 --> 23:05.633
<i>- They're going to kill us!
- You don't know that!</i>

23:08.696 --> 23:12.098
When I add it all up,
the last three years,

23:12.864 --> 23:14.130
before Rachel was...

23:18.595 --> 23:19.954
Hira was shot

23:20.517 --> 23:21.970
right in front of me.

23:23.704 --> 23:25.462
And I just never thought...

23:26.985 --> 23:30.923
I just never thought that I would see
something like that... in person.

23:31.043 --> 23:35.118
I know I work in a science lab,
I deal with death all the time, but...

23:37.756 --> 23:38.958
But murder is...

23:42.443 --> 23:45.607
Murder is something
that you see on the news.

23:47.154 --> 23:48.139
And...

23:49.310 --> 23:50.506
And you say

23:50.834 --> 23:52.264
"That's awful," you know,

23:52.384 --> 23:55.826
and then you go on with your life,
or you change the channel.

23:56.578 --> 23:59.062
And 18 months later,
the suicide attack...

23:59.308 --> 24:02.590
Lying there, wondering why I could see
a part of my body torn off...

24:02.710 --> 24:04.957
Your recovery from those events,

24:05.077 --> 24:05.779
both

24:06.330 --> 24:08.779
physically and emotionally,
was exceptional.

24:11.059 --> 24:13.473
Yeah, but now,
with Rachel gone, I just...

24:15.231 --> 24:18.254
Oh, God. I'm just wondering,
"what's next?"

24:20.176 --> 24:23.902
I've never gotten the sense that
you're the type of person to repress.

24:24.887 --> 24:26.832
Sure, I'm dealing with it.

24:31.168 --> 24:32.428
Care to say how?

24:34.332 --> 24:35.715
Cut myself off.

24:38.340 --> 24:41.481
I've already got one phantom limb,
why not the whole body?

24:44.653 --> 24:45.524
Excuse me.

24:50.104 --> 24:52.297
- Where you going?
- I'll be back in two hours.

24:52.417 --> 24:54.283
- You just got here.
- And now I'm going.

24:54.403 --> 24:56.516
What is it with you?
When you're here, you're not here,

24:56.636 --> 24:58.704
when you're not here,
at least we can breathe.

24:58.825 --> 24:59.854
Breathe deeply.

24:59.974 --> 25:02.058
You've got a lot of work
with these two jobs.

25:02.178 --> 25:04.589
Maybe you should think
about moving back to bioinformatics.

25:04.709 --> 25:06.670
- Are you demoting me?
- I'm close.

25:08.504 --> 25:10.168
It's not about the job.

25:10.567 --> 25:11.774
It's personal.

25:16.508 --> 25:18.770
I have a daughter at Sick Kids.

25:20.199 --> 25:23.153
She has aplastic anaemia
and she needs a bone marrow transplant,

25:23.273 --> 25:25.613
- and I'm not a donor match.
- You have a daughter?

25:25.733 --> 25:27.418
Gave her up for adoption.

25:27.793 --> 25:30.382
Now I'm going back to the hospital
to repeat the blood test

25:30.502 --> 25:32.663
- in case there was an error.
- Jesus, Mayko...

25:33.191 --> 25:35.953
Look, I'll be back soon.
I'm sorry about all this.

25:44.203 --> 25:45.469
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

25:57.070 --> 25:58.148
Hi, David.

25:59.491 --> 26:00.569
What's wrong?

26:00.780 --> 26:02.327
Acyclovir didn't work on me.

26:03.171 --> 26:05.444
We've got nothing else. Not yet.

26:05.960 --> 26:06.803
Yet?

26:07.858 --> 26:09.850
There're some cancer treatments

26:10.132 --> 26:11.944
that blast stem cells.

26:12.105 --> 26:15.290
But how can you differentiate
between my stem cells and Nina's own?

26:15.778 --> 26:18.409
- She would become anaemic.
- It's all we've got so far.

26:19.121 --> 26:20.012
Nina,

26:20.410 --> 26:23.223
can you describe the state you were in
when you attacked Bob?

26:23.343 --> 26:25.638
- Carlos, she didn't really attack me.
- Bob.

26:26.355 --> 26:28.283
I felt like he's was going
to suffocate me.

26:28.403 --> 26:31.088
It was like I didn't know who he was
but I knew he meant me harm.

26:31.249 --> 26:33.231
- And you felt this?
- I saw it.

26:33.653 --> 26:34.883
I was hallucinating.

26:35.647 --> 26:39.600
I had another hallucination
where I stabbed Bob in the hand.

26:39.720 --> 26:40.539
Bob,

26:41.009 --> 26:42.354
Nina's on the edge here.

26:42.474 --> 26:45.352
She needs to be someplace
where she won't harm herself

26:45.514 --> 26:47.521
- or anybody else.
- But she wouldn't.

26:47.642 --> 26:48.865
I'm sure she wouldn't.

26:48.985 --> 26:50.649
It's not me anymore, Bob.

26:51.702 --> 26:53.110
Not all the time.

26:56.636 --> 26:58.136
Once we check into the hospital,

26:58.256 --> 27:01.742
what're the chances of treating her with
anything other than psychotropic drugs?

27:01.862 --> 27:04.827
If anything we've been
investigating here has any merit,

27:04.947 --> 27:06.623
the hospital won't let us use it.

27:07.180 --> 27:10.906
Or if they do, it'll take months
to get administrative approval.

27:15.008 --> 27:16.062
I'm afraid.

27:17.867 --> 27:19.297
And I need help.

27:24.008 --> 27:25.684
There is something we can do here,

27:26.094 --> 27:27.031
now.

27:27.336 --> 27:29.605
When we really need the hospital,
then...

27:32.950 --> 27:35.694
Taking her there now
would be like giving up, David.

27:42.816 --> 27:44.785
How long will the sedative last?

27:45.394 --> 27:47.480
She'll be groggy about 4 hours.

27:48.359 --> 27:49.296
Hey,

27:49.730 --> 27:52.630
did Mayko tell you about her friend?

27:53.701 --> 27:56.015
- Her friend?
- The little girl,

27:56.631 --> 27:58.681
at the hospital, friend of hers.

27:59.560 --> 28:00.908
Her daughter.

28:01.875 --> 28:03.017
I saw her.

28:03.662 --> 28:05.915
Aplastic anaemia. It's tough.

28:06.943 --> 28:10.359
Mayko flunked out as a match.
She went back to get re-tested.

28:10.479 --> 28:13.385
Parents are rarely,
if ever, a good match.

28:14.190 --> 28:16.652
How old is she? The little girl?

28:17.485 --> 28:18.237
Six.

28:20.391 --> 28:21.091
Hey.

28:21.734 --> 28:23.301
So, how is she?

28:23.860 --> 28:24.860
Not good.

28:25.452 --> 28:26.286
Sorry.

28:28.033 --> 28:30.288
I need to get in touch with...

28:30.408 --> 28:31.468
the father.

28:37.303 --> 28:38.424
Excuse me.

28:42.589 --> 28:45.514
I thought about an abortion,
okay, but then I kept thinking:

28:45.634 --> 28:49.024
"You were adopted, Mayko.
People are always looking for babies."

28:49.361 --> 28:51.728
You never considered
talking to me about this?

28:51.890 --> 28:54.022
It was so obvious
that you didn't want another kid.

28:54.374 --> 28:56.365
You barely saw the one you already had!

28:56.485 --> 28:58.551
That's your take on it,
and it's hardly the point.

28:58.671 --> 29:00.487
David, what were we back then?

29:00.921 --> 29:02.997
Another one
of your student-professor relationships.

29:03.117 --> 29:04.603
I needed a solid guy,

29:04.723 --> 29:07.781
not some uncommitted
temperamental alcoholic asshole!

29:09.265 --> 29:12.569
- I'm sorry, but...
- How fucking dare you?

29:14.141 --> 29:15.367
How dare you

29:15.760 --> 29:19.339
dump this on me like I shouldn't have
a fucking feeling about it?

29:23.261 --> 29:24.986
You want to have a feeling?

29:28.205 --> 29:30.184
Maggie and Stewart Berner.
That's his cell number.

29:30.345 --> 29:31.940
That's the hospital room.

29:47.262 --> 29:48.269
Oh, excuse me.

29:48.389 --> 29:49.933
Are you the specialist?

29:51.526 --> 29:52.831
I'm sorry, say again?

29:53.110 --> 29:55.466
Dr. Denver told us
there's a medical conference in town,

29:55.586 --> 29:58.545
that several blood specialists
would be here and that

29:58.865 --> 30:00.460
he'd try to be in touch. Are you...?

30:00.580 --> 30:01.671
A specialist, no.

30:05.545 --> 30:06.718
I'm the father.

30:07.486 --> 30:09.656
The... the biological father.

30:12.173 --> 30:13.393
Mayko found you.

30:14.553 --> 30:15.976
Yeah, Mayko found me.

30:17.509 --> 30:18.265
So...

30:19.358 --> 30:21.026
you understand, about Hannah's illness?

30:26.339 --> 30:28.200
Who do I see about this test?

30:31.756 --> 30:34.261
I can find the herpes viral DNA
in the monkey samples,

30:34.381 --> 30:36.190
but there's no indication
it's replicating.

30:36.310 --> 30:37.929
And it sure looks chromosomal.

30:38.049 --> 30:40.299
Did you probe with other herpes strains?

30:40.419 --> 30:41.844
Yes. There's nothing.

30:42.735 --> 30:44.430
Do they all look like this?

30:44.713 --> 30:45.485
Well,

30:46.119 --> 30:48.671
there's a few samples where
the herpes virus is more prevalent.

30:48.791 --> 30:49.997
Sorry I'm late.

30:51.796 --> 30:53.564
- The herpes DNA?
- Yes.

30:54.421 --> 30:56.027
Shit, it has integrated.

30:56.497 --> 30:58.267
How many more cells have it?

30:58.484 --> 31:00.732
10 to 20%,
but I haven't determined any correlation

31:00.852 --> 31:02.301
between these samples, however.

31:02.421 --> 31:04.292
How many samples
are showing this increase?

31:04.412 --> 31:05.669
3 out of 24.

31:08.479 --> 31:11.004
- Thanks for all your help, Enuka.
- You're welcome.

31:11.683 --> 31:12.432
Bob.

31:13.347 --> 31:15.806
- How's Nina?
- She's still sedated.

31:16.774 --> 31:20.595
It's disconcerting to see her like this,
but I'm grateful she's here.

31:20.715 --> 31:22.129
That's okay. Go do your thing.

31:22.290 --> 31:23.358
Thank you.

31:28.820 --> 31:30.159
What're you doing tonight?

31:30.962 --> 31:34.099
I gotta get the hell out of that hotel,
so I'm going to go see some apartments.

31:34.764 --> 31:37.102
You feel like
having another look at mine?

31:37.935 --> 31:39.433
So, what have you got?

31:39.909 --> 31:42.239
The last 3 monkeys
injected with my stem cells;

31:42.359 --> 31:45.737
I detected
some extra chromosomal viral DNA.

31:45.857 --> 31:49.016
I'm staining for herpes proteins
as we speak.

31:49.136 --> 31:51.199
They might actually be replicating.

31:51.360 --> 31:53.578
We found no replicating virus
in the previous set, so

31:53.698 --> 31:55.104
if what you're seeing is right,

31:55.224 --> 31:58.425
at the start of the operation
the virus begins to replicate,

31:58.545 --> 32:00.250
but as time passes it becomes dormant?

32:00.987 --> 32:03.298
Anything else administered
in conjunction with the stem cells?

32:03.418 --> 32:04.418
Saline.

32:04.538 --> 32:05.957
Completely innocuous.

32:06.751 --> 32:08.431
Were they anaesthetized?

32:10.259 --> 32:13.113
Some kind of interaction between
the anaesthetic and my stem cells?

32:13.299 --> 32:15.908
Something has to be activating
the herpes virus.

32:27.005 --> 32:29.058
Bob! Wait! Carlos, get a sedative!

32:43.720 --> 32:45.671
Nina! Nina!

32:56.801 --> 32:58.959
Let's get her to the couch, come on.

33:08.318 --> 33:10.736
Sedative's not going to last long.
We need to get some restraints.

33:10.856 --> 33:13.612
- I'll go get something.
- She needs to be admitted, Bob.

33:13.732 --> 33:15.784
I think I may have found something.
Carlos?

33:16.277 --> 33:17.661
Maybe. We were conjecturing.

33:18.200 --> 33:20.205
David, please.
Just ten minutes, please...

33:29.927 --> 33:33.612
We don't know what type of anaesthetic
was used to knock out the monkeys, eh?

33:33.732 --> 33:35.362
We don't have those records.

33:35.482 --> 33:38.813
I suspect it was ketamine
combined with some kind of opioid.

33:38.933 --> 33:39.985
And that, what,

33:40.105 --> 33:43.050
interacted with Bob's stem cells
and the herpes virus got stimulated...?

33:43.170 --> 33:46.523
Ketamine can increase dopamine levels.
If they made a mistake in the dosage...

33:46.984 --> 33:49.612
We don't have time
for maybes and maybe nots.

33:49.732 --> 33:51.737
Don't we have
a definitive conclusion here?

33:51.898 --> 33:55.198
These monkeys had a replicating virus.
They were the most recent test subjects.

33:55.359 --> 33:57.486
The previous ones had no virus.

33:57.654 --> 34:00.173
So you would have got the dose
right with this group?

34:00.293 --> 34:01.293
Yes.

34:01.413 --> 34:04.666
Maybe it has something to do with
ketamine blocking the NMDA receptor?

34:05.293 --> 34:06.156
Maybe.

34:06.773 --> 34:08.253
We got a whole lot of maybes here

34:08.418 --> 34:10.440
and Nina should be
on a program of anti-psychotics

34:10.561 --> 34:12.179
while we figure this out.

34:12.532 --> 34:16.106
It doesn't mean we're giving up, Bob.
You can be with her as much as you want.

34:16.967 --> 34:19.721
Bob, she has elevated
dopamine levels, like the monkeys.

34:19.841 --> 34:22.684
This can lead to psychosis.
We should try Risperidone.

34:22.844 --> 34:26.103
- It's a strong dopamine-blocking drug.
- What are the side effects?

34:26.853 --> 34:30.014
Insomnia, low blood pressure,
tremors, the usual risks...

34:30.134 --> 34:32.203
diabetes, ketoacidosis.

34:32.663 --> 34:33.752
I hate this.

34:34.668 --> 34:35.947
She's coming to.

34:46.822 --> 34:50.253
Maggie Berner called.
You were a marginally better match.

34:51.570 --> 34:52.714
But not enough.

35:00.605 --> 35:01.723
So that's it?

35:02.850 --> 35:03.917
Well, I can't...

35:04.393 --> 35:06.016
I can't change my blood type.

35:06.136 --> 35:07.602
I still cannot believe,

35:07.722 --> 35:11.006
after everything we've been through
together, that you never once thought...

35:11.126 --> 35:13.861
I thought about it every fucking day,
David, okay?

35:13.981 --> 35:17.364
I'm sorry, I didn't see anything
that made me want to talk about it.

35:19.217 --> 35:21.714
Well, we are gonna
fucking talk about it now.

35:24.147 --> 35:26.296
I can't undo the past, okay?

35:26.666 --> 35:29.512
You keep going there
if that's how you need to do it.

35:44.230 --> 35:46.046
Looks scary, but she's fine.

35:48.478 --> 35:50.355
It's going to take some time, Bob.

35:52.237 --> 35:54.310
You should get home, get some rest.

35:56.113 --> 35:58.610
I will.
I just wanna watch her for a while.

36:00.882 --> 36:01.684
Okay.

36:02.232 --> 36:03.436
Thanks, Carlos.

36:27.234 --> 36:28.393
What? What?

36:28.743 --> 36:29.995
What's happening?

36:30.115 --> 36:31.294
He's staring.

36:33.531 --> 36:34.865
He'll lose interest.

36:34.985 --> 36:36.543
That's what I'm worried about.

36:36.663 --> 36:37.888
Come on, David.

36:38.958 --> 36:40.530
This isn't a performance review.

36:41.912 --> 36:43.501
Then again, it could be.

36:47.206 --> 36:48.387
What? What?

36:49.923 --> 36:50.922
David...

36:53.231 --> 36:54.344
You know what?

36:56.112 --> 36:58.565
If she wanted me to support her,

36:58.685 --> 37:01.923
if that had been her choice,
I would've supported her.

37:02.479 --> 37:05.884
You know, to cut me out of the equation
like that, it's just so fucking cold.

37:07.370 --> 37:08.855
I know. I know.

37:09.775 --> 37:10.828
It's harsh.

37:12.424 --> 37:13.903
Doesn't make her a bad person.

37:15.409 --> 37:17.810
I have a little girl. I have a daughter

37:17.930 --> 37:19.408
that I never knew about.

37:21.362 --> 37:24.614
David, why don't you think of this
as a beautiful gift?

37:27.988 --> 37:29.911
The little girl's gonna die.

37:31.086 --> 37:32.300
She's gonna die.

37:32.643 --> 37:34.255
There's nothing I can do about it.

37:34.910 --> 37:37.526
If I'd known about it,
if I had been there

37:37.646 --> 37:39.454
when she was born, I sh...

37:40.961 --> 37:41.761
I...

37:42.454 --> 37:43.254
Fuck!

37:44.534 --> 37:45.267
What?

37:47.735 --> 37:50.440
If I'd been there when she was born!
My daughter!

37:50.560 --> 37:52.539
When my daughter was born... My first...

37:52.659 --> 37:55.704
When my first daughter was born, Lilith,
her mother and I,

37:55.824 --> 37:58.297
we signed her up for this new service.

37:58.595 --> 37:59.365
We...

37:59.697 --> 38:01.347
We saved her cord blood.

38:01.581 --> 38:03.202
We saved her cord blood!

38:03.322 --> 38:06.287
It was a brilliant idea.
It should never be privatized.

38:06.584 --> 38:08.289
Cord blood from a half-sibling?

38:11.174 --> 38:12.278
Here it is.

38:13.748 --> 38:16.113
I just hope they're still in business.

38:24.386 --> 38:26.930
It was a long shot.
Lilith isn't a perfect match either,

38:27.050 --> 38:29.284
but she's a better match than Mayko, me,

38:29.404 --> 38:31.109
 or anything in the blood bank.

38:31.229 --> 38:33.046
There's still a chance
she might reject them.

38:33.166 --> 38:35.478
Yes, but remember, these are
stem cells we're talking about.

38:35.639 --> 38:37.890
They're very potent, flexible.
Most importantly,

38:38.010 --> 38:41.165
once in her system, they'll become
exactly what she needs them to be.

38:41.285 --> 38:43.670
Pure, fresh virginal bone marrow.

38:44.246 --> 38:45.956
That's a beautiful idea.

38:48.653 --> 38:50.623
We're really lucky David did this.

38:50.863 --> 38:53.167
Eighteen years ago,
no one was storing cord blood.

38:53.598 --> 38:55.337
Thank you so much...

38:56.122 --> 38:57.590
You can't get at it,

38:57.710 --> 38:59.632
not in words, what she means to us...

39:00.036 --> 39:01.417
It's okay. We understand.

39:01.537 --> 39:05.134
Stewart and I feel that it wouldn't
be right to go back to the way it was.

39:05.254 --> 39:07.153
To just pretend that you don't exist.

39:07.427 --> 39:09.120
We were hoping after...

39:09.765 --> 39:12.836
you could still be a part of her life.
That you'd be in her life.

39:12.956 --> 39:13.786
Yeah.

39:13.906 --> 39:15.743
We'd all be lucky to have you.

39:17.732 --> 39:18.999
All ready then?

39:21.436 --> 39:23.085
Clear the hallway, please.

39:26.097 --> 39:27.231
Hey, sweetie.

39:27.351 --> 39:29.280
Ready to be brave, little girl?

39:29.851 --> 39:30.851
Yes, Mama.

39:31.162 --> 39:32.227
Okay, kiddo.

39:32.621 --> 39:33.947
- Let's go.
- Bye.

39:34.351 --> 39:35.278
See you.

39:35.617 --> 39:36.732
Bye, Hannah.

39:38.378 --> 39:39.625
Let's do this.

39:52.007 --> 39:55.024
She's improved remarkably,
but normally it takes weeks

39:55.144 --> 39:57.993
to notice the effects
of anti-psychotic drugs.

39:58.113 --> 40:00.932
But we are going to keep an eye on you,
in case of adverse reactions.

40:01.052 --> 40:02.052
I understand.

40:02.226 --> 40:04.515
There's a functional MRI
scheduled for this afternoon,

40:04.635 --> 40:07.070
and we'll take a look
at the Jacobson's Organ.

40:07.369 --> 40:11.368
But your cognitive function's improving
and your vitals are approaching normal.

40:11.789 --> 40:12.492
These?

40:13.502 --> 40:15.845
You need those
for your own safety, Nina.

40:16.217 --> 40:18.446
All right? I'll check in on you later.

40:18.663 --> 40:20.013
Thanks, Dr. Bruen.

40:25.165 --> 40:28.793
Actually, I'd like to see
a battery of tests. Is the MRI enough?

40:31.618 --> 40:32.638
Come here.

40:33.476 --> 40:34.476
Beside me.

40:42.383 --> 40:44.425
We're gonna get through this, alright?

40:44.847 --> 40:46.363
I feel a difference.

40:46.728 --> 40:47.728
Don't you?

40:58.354 --> 40:59.655
Can't you feel me?

41:02.586 --> 41:03.410
Sorry.

41:06.121 --> 41:07.357
Just undo one.

41:07.866 --> 41:09.549
I want to hold you so much.

41:09.710 --> 41:11.184
We have to be careful.

41:12.289 --> 41:14.577
Then loosen it just a little.

41:15.903 --> 41:17.326
Don't you miss me?

41:36.802 --> 41:39.001
The board meeting's been pushed
'till next Thursday.

41:39.121 --> 41:42.248
I've blocked out Wednesday afternoon-
evening for a quick internal review.

41:42.409 --> 41:45.359
And that malaria outbreak in Oaxaca
has supposedly been stabilized

41:45.479 --> 41:48.334
- but I'm keeping my eye on it.
- Okay. Hannah?

41:50.097 --> 41:52.067
She was a trooper during chemotherapy.

41:53.088 --> 41:54.524
The transplant went

41:54.644 --> 41:56.888
as well as they could hope for,
but they won't know

41:57.104 --> 41:59.748
if her system accepts
the new stem cells for a while.

41:59.968 --> 42:01.154
They. Not we?

42:02.511 --> 42:04.020
They're the family, David.

42:05.079 --> 42:06.439
Offer was on the table.

42:07.944 --> 42:09.120
Yeah, it was.

42:11.577 --> 42:13.571
I mean, we made that little girl, Mayko.

42:13.732 --> 42:16.318
We've got a chance here to do something.

42:16.534 --> 42:18.750
And what would that something be, David?

42:19.823 --> 42:20.929
I don't know...

42:23.008 --> 42:24.083
I don't know.

42:26.646 --> 42:30.066
There's... There's a conference
coming up in Rio

42:30.335 --> 42:31.868
that you might be interested in.

42:31.988 --> 42:34.221
But, I mean,
we should do something, right?

42:38.482 --> 42:40.619
I'll leave it for you to think about.

42:56.363 --> 42:58.715
- Was it you that called earlier?
- Yeah.

43:00.681 --> 43:03.097
You wanted to know
if everything was okay.

43:04.429 --> 43:06.374
I took off one of her restraints.

43:07.682 --> 43:08.969
She asked me to.

43:11.494 --> 43:13.571
She pulled the keychain
out of my pocket,

43:13.691 --> 43:16.254
the one with the little
Army knife on it?

43:16.511 --> 43:18.720
And then she started stabbing herself.

43:22.356 --> 43:23.547
Your hands...

43:25.969 --> 43:28.764
I tried to take the knife away from her.

43:32.080 --> 43:33.439
It's so little...

43:34.354 --> 43:36.743
It's ridiculous
to call it even a knife...

43:40.154 --> 43:41.314
Where is she?

43:50.319 --> 43:53.641
To be understated, her recovery
was obviously misleading.

43:53.761 --> 43:55.577
Have you taken her off the Risperidone?

43:55.697 --> 43:58.372
No. There could still be some traces
of Acyclovir in her system,

43:58.492 --> 44:01.630
and I'd like to see how she reacts
to the Risperidone on its own.

44:01.750 --> 44:03.139
And if that doesn't work?

44:04.084 --> 44:07.801
Lithium... Prozac...? There're thousands
of different chemicals in the brain.

44:07.921 --> 44:10.033
When there's an imbalance like this,

44:10.153 --> 44:12.499
it's not easy coming up with a cocktail.

44:12.684 --> 44:14.525
- And in some cases...
- You never do.

44:17.198 --> 44:18.191
Thank you.

44:33.021 --> 44:35.803
When she was stabbing herself,
she looked me in the eyes

44:35.923 --> 44:37.742
and told me that she loved me.

44:40.596 --> 44:42.448
Every time the knife went in...

44:43.719 --> 44:45.104
I could feel it.

45:04.724 --> 45:07.378
I understand. Take it easy.
I'm on my way.

45:07.573 --> 45:10.506
- What?
- Nina's got a blood clot or something.

45:10.626 --> 45:12.792
They don't think
she's gonna make it through the night.

45:13.208 --> 45:14.568
I did this to her.

45:14.999 --> 45:17.964
I was playing God,
I was meddling with the human species.

45:18.125 --> 45:20.049
I have no right to call myself
a scientist.

45:20.839 --> 45:22.652
I don't know what to do.

45:22.963 --> 45:25.074
Telling everybody
that your kid was dragged off

45:25.194 --> 45:28.556
by a fanged creature isn't screwing
with the system; that's crazy.

45:29.250 --> 45:31.055
<i>My boy was killed by a monster!</i>

45:31.654 --> 45:33.521
You don't think she did this to my boy?

45:33.682 --> 45:37.073
- She didn't do anything to Billy.
- You don't know her anymore.

45:37.799 --> 45:39.876
I only found one pint of blood.

45:40.355 --> 45:43.197
A boy his size and weight
should have 3 or 4 quarts.

45:43.590 --> 45:44.699
I saw it, Enuka.

45:45.529 --> 45:46.879
Dragging him off.

45:47.137 --> 45:49.453
Some farmer shot something
down here this morning.

45:49.573 --> 45:50.413
Something?

45:50.533 --> 45:52.155
- It's a coyote.
- This is not.

45:52.275 --> 45:54.083
It is, according
to the barcode database.

45:54.244 --> 45:56.252
Hair samples
under the boy's fingernails:

45:56.372 --> 45:58.171
not a match to the coyote tissue.

46:00.295 --> 46:01.655
What's going on?

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
