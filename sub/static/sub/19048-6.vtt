WEBVTT

00:02.711 --> 00:04.837
[Gavel Raps] [Woman] Next case.

00:04.963 --> 00:07.840
Mr. Dennis Reynolds. [Dennis] That's me.
Yeah. Right here.

00:07.925 --> 00:09.926
How are ya?
[Chuckles]

00:10.010 --> 00:14.305
From October 28, 2008,
to November 1, 2008,

00:14.390 --> 00:20.061
you were issued a series
of parking citations totaling $1,300.

00:20.145 --> 00:24.399
- Who are these people? - Oh, uh, these
people are here to corroborate my story.

00:24.483 --> 00:26.693
- It's a parking violation.
- Oh, well.

00:26.777 --> 00:29.362
I think you'll find it goes
much, much deeper than that.

00:29.446 --> 00:32.240
Yes, Lady Madam of the court,
I do believe that this court will realize...

00:32.323 --> 00:36.035
that we were all victims of a terrible ordeal
that caused each and every one of us...

00:36.120 --> 00:38.830
great physical
and emotional trauma.

00:38.914 --> 00:40.373
And what is this ordeal?

00:40.457 --> 00:44.460
The Philadelphia Phillies winning
the World Series, Your Honor.

01:18.996 --> 01:23.249
Okay, Mr. Reynolds. On what grounds
are you contesting these tickets?

01:23.375 --> 01:25.418
Well- What grounds?
Where do we even begin?

01:25.544 --> 01:27.420
Oh, yeah.
On many grounds, Your Honor.

01:27.546 --> 01:29.213
Many, many grounds.
Yes.

01:29.298 --> 01:31.674
And let the record show that we are
waiving our right to an attorney.

01:31.759 --> 01:35.011
Just explain to me why you feel you should
not have been issued these tickets.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.805
Okay. Um, yeah.
Well, I think in order to do that,

01:37.890 --> 01:40.099
we should probably start
at the top of the story.

01:40.184 --> 01:42.101
I know what the story is.
Oh, all right.

01:42.186 --> 01:44.437
It was game five
of the World Series,

01:44.521 --> 01:46.439
and we actually had tickets.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.691
Needless to say,
I mean, we were pumped.

01:48.776 --> 01:51.778
## [Hard Rock]

01:51.904 --> 01:55.573
## [Continues]
World Series, baby!

01:55.657 --> 01:57.325
Oh, yeah!

01:57.409 --> 01:59.660
Hey-oh!
What's up, fellas?

01:59.745 --> 02:02.538
What's going on, man? Not wearing any colors?
Not supporting the team, dude?

02:02.623 --> 02:05.124
Wearing colors? Why the hell
would I be wearing colors to...

02:05.209 --> 02:08.002
Oh, my God! Today's the World Series!
I totally forgot.

02:08.086 --> 02:10.545
Oh, wait a second. What's this?
[Charlie Cackles]

02:10.672 --> 02:13.132
You didn't forget! Boom!
I didn't forget a "thang"!

02:13.217 --> 02:16.803
This is one of the few times where it is
acceptable to be shirtless in a public forum.

02:16.887 --> 02:19.305
So I'm blasting bare chest the whole time.
What do you think?

02:19.389 --> 02:21.682
- Smart.
- I think you're gonna be cold as shit.

02:21.767 --> 02:24.769
I'm not gonna be cold at all 'cause
I'm gonna be wasted on grain alcohol.

02:24.895 --> 02:28.022
Grain alcohol. Whenever there's a potential
riot, I'm getting blasted on grain alcohol.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.816
Riot juice!
It's like rum punch!

02:29.900 --> 02:31.442
Put some of that
on my bug bites.

02:31.527 --> 02:34.403
We're not gonna be wasting our fine grain
alcohol on your goddamn bug bites, idiots!

02:34.488 --> 02:36.989
Yeah. We need it for pregaming.
I am not watching this game sober.

02:37.074 --> 02:39.367
- No. What? Do you want to remember it?
- Charlie, come here.

02:39.451 --> 02:41.327
Back to back.
Back to back? Okay.

02:41.453 --> 02:43.746
What's going on with you guys, huh?
Oh, we got bed bugs, dude.

02:43.831 --> 02:46.374
Oh, man. The place is infested with them.
Some guy brought them back from Haiti.

02:46.458 --> 02:49.001
World Series, bitches!
What is up?

02:49.127 --> 02:53.381
Oh! # Whoomp, there it is
Whoomp, there it is #.

02:53.507 --> 02:56.926
Plan's still on, right?
Oh, shit yeah, baby girl. Plan is on.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.845
Hey! Time out.
There's a plan?

02:58.971 --> 03:02.181
- There's always a plan, buddy.
- Why didn't you tell me about this? What's the plan?

03:02.266 --> 03:05.393
Okay, in the bottom of the ninth when the
Phillies are up by, like, 50 or 60 runs,

03:05.477 --> 03:07.854
Dennis and I are gonna start
beating the shit out of each other.

03:07.980 --> 03:09.981
Which will attract the
attention of Security. Yeah.

03:10.065 --> 03:12.525
And that's when I run on the
field and kiss a player. Oh!

03:12.609 --> 03:15.987
# Whoomp, there it is
Whoomp, there it is #.

03:16.071 --> 03:18.322
And I will toss on Green Man
and run around the field...

03:18.407 --> 03:20.741
- No.
- And go crazy as Green Man.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.785
No, no, no, no, no.
Whoomp, there it goes.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.912
Don't toss on Green Man
because in this particular case,

03:24.997 --> 03:27.206
the Philly Phrenetic
really reigns supreme, okay?

03:27.291 --> 03:29.917
We're talking about the Phillies here.
Leave that for other shit.

03:30.002 --> 03:32.628
- Are you kidding me?
- Dude, people love that guy. - We love him.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.589
I don't love him!
I'm sick of him!

03:34.673 --> 03:37.925
He's got a stranglehold on the
Philly mascot scene. It's not fair!

03:38.010 --> 03:41.971
I got a pretty good thing going with Green Man.
I don't see why there can only be one mascot.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.265
No. I feel like there's
only room for one green idiot...

03:44.349 --> 03:46.517
running around
making an asshole of himself.

03:46.602 --> 03:48.603
Whoa. I can't find the tickets.

03:48.687 --> 03:51.439
- What are you talking about?
- I don't have the tickets in my pocket!

03:51.523 --> 03:54.191
- [Charlie] What, dude?
- Nowhere. I know exactly where I left them.

03:54.276 --> 03:56.360
I left them on the coffee table
in the apartment.

03:56.486 --> 03:59.405
We don't have time to go back.
We're not gonna get a good spot for the tailgating!

03:59.489 --> 04:01.949
- We gotta go back and get 'em.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

04:02.034 --> 04:04.994
Dennis, Charlie, why don't you go to
the parking lot, get us a good spot.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.954
- We'll go get the tickets.
- All right. Let's move, man.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.665
I can't believe I forgot the tickets.
Jesus Christ, Frank.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.251
I don't know. All I'm doing is,
like, just making the sandwiches.

04:12.377 --> 04:14.045
By the way-
Shut up!

04:16.005 --> 04:18.673
Okay, I think it's important to figure
out which player I want to kiss...

04:18.759 --> 04:20.635
when I thrust myself out
on that field.

04:20.719 --> 04:22.136
I'm going Shane Victorino right now.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.638
Flyin' Hawaiian.
Flyin' Hawaiian.

04:23.722 --> 04:25.306
Strong choice.
But center field- way too far.

04:25.432 --> 04:28.059
You'll get jacked out before you
get anywhere close. Oh. Oh!

04:28.185 --> 04:30.728
[Gasps]
Balls! Oh, no!

04:30.812 --> 04:32.730
They're fumigating
the building for bed bugs.

04:32.814 --> 04:35.775
How did you not know that they were
bug bombing your apartment, bro?

04:35.859 --> 04:38.694
I can't read every flyer that
gets slipped under the door!

04:38.820 --> 04:41.238
Jesus Christ.
Well, now what are we gonna do?

04:41.323 --> 04:43.783
- Well, I don't know. We gotta go-
- Go get the tickets! Hurry up!

04:43.867 --> 04:46.619
I'm not going in there!
That's full of toxic smoke.

04:46.745 --> 04:49.747
We'll go buy gas masks.
We don't have time for gas masks!

04:49.831 --> 04:52.833
Frank, come on. It's not that poisonous.
Just go really fast.

04:52.918 --> 04:55.795
- Shit. All right.
- [Mac] Jesus Christ.

04:55.879 --> 04:57.797
[Coughing]

04:57.881 --> 05:01.384
[All Coughing] Oh, God!

05:01.468 --> 05:03.469
- My eyes are burning!
- Now what?

05:03.553 --> 05:05.262
All right. Fine!

05:05.347 --> 05:08.307
I'll have to scale the building, cut a hole
in the tent, smash through the window.

05:08.392 --> 05:10.309
That'll cut down
on occupancy time.

05:10.394 --> 05:13.312
You are not capable
of doing that.

05:13.397 --> 05:16.148
I absolutely have the upper body
strength to accomplish that.

05:16.274 --> 05:18.651
Are you kidding me?
Goddamn it, Dee! Goddamn it!

05:18.735 --> 05:21.320
Will you shut up? I'm calling the
boys to tell 'em we're gonna be late.

05:21.405 --> 05:24.115
They're doing that right now?

05:24.241 --> 05:26.242
All right. Keep me posted.
Shit. What's up, man?

05:26.326 --> 05:28.828
Bro, they are bug bombing your building right now.
They got the whole thing tented.

05:28.954 --> 05:31.163
Oh, my God! Those guys can't get
in there to get the tickets.

05:31.248 --> 05:34.000
There's no way they're gonna.
That's poisonous gas, dude. You can't breathe that.

05:34.126 --> 05:37.294
Screw 'em, right? What are you suggesting?
Maybe we sneak into the game?

05:37.379 --> 05:40.047
I want to get into that game.
I don't even want to tailgate anymore, bro.

05:40.132 --> 05:42.383
Oh, you're right! We gotta sneak in.
All right. We're gonna sneak.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.927
How are we gonna sneak in though, bro?
Security's gonna be crazy.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.221
There's a couple ways
you can do it.

05:47.305 --> 05:50.516
One, we can take the secret tunnel that
goes from the Ollidy lnn into the stadium.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.226
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.

05:52.310 --> 05:54.729
There's no secret tunnel going from
the stadium to the Ollidy Inn.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.273
What the hell are you talking about?
This is common knowledge, bro.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.276
There is. They built a secret tunnel
so that the visiting players...

06:00.360 --> 06:03.821
can get safely back to the hotel without
the Phillies fans hammering them.

06:03.947 --> 06:06.532
We're passionate fans. Passionate fans.
We gotta hammer something.

06:06.616 --> 06:09.243
So they got a tunnel for that? Wow.
Don't you think there's gonna be security there too?

06:09.327 --> 06:11.954
There might. All right.
You know what? I got it.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.623
We're gonna do a Charlie One-Two, all right?
You're gonna do this, okay?

06:14.750 --> 06:17.752
Okay. One, you jump in front of
a car coming into the stadium.

06:17.836 --> 06:20.921
Two, you say, "I'm gonna sue you
if you don't give me tickets."

06:21.006 --> 06:24.300
No! No!
That is a terrible plan.

06:24.426 --> 06:26.969
How is that terrible?
Because it involves me getting hit by a car.

06:27.054 --> 06:30.514
You'll be fine, bro. You're drinking riot punch, man.
You'll bounce off that thing.

06:30.599 --> 06:33.267
It's called the Charlie One-Two.
You do it.

06:33.351 --> 06:35.269
Well, no.
I've done too many, man.

06:35.395 --> 06:38.856
The next one could be my last.
I don't want to get hit by a moving car.

06:38.982 --> 06:41.233
You'll be fine!
This is the World Series, man.

06:41.318 --> 06:44.153
I don't want to do any more,
dude. I could die.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.614
You do it.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.700
All right, goddamn it. I'm gonna do it.
Let's do it! Last time. One last time.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.707
Too shitty, right?
Crappy car. Yeah.

06:56.833 --> 07:00.086
No, you don't want to jump out in front of a shitty car.
We need rich people tickets.

07:00.212 --> 07:02.630
Rich seats. Oh. Ooh. This guy right here.
This is a good one.

07:02.714 --> 07:06.675
This is gonna be a good one, dude.
He's gonna have such good seats. Go, go, go! Go!

07:06.760 --> 07:09.220
What are you doing, man?
Bro, that guy was gonna have great seats.

07:09.346 --> 07:11.764
Yeah. I felt like I didn't have a good angle.
What do you mean?

07:11.890 --> 07:14.266
I might go this way.
You just jump right out in front of him.

07:14.392 --> 07:16.685
This guy'll have good seats.
Don't get cold feet on me.

07:16.812 --> 07:19.814
Jump out in front of this guy.
I'm fine. This guy's good.

07:19.898 --> 07:22.399
[Screaming]

07:22.484 --> 07:25.986
Your Honor, so my friend here pushed me
in front of a moving car. No big deal.

07:26.071 --> 07:28.781
Ladies and gentlemen of the court,
these were dire times,

07:28.865 --> 07:32.159
and dire actions were needed
to get those tickets!

07:32.285 --> 07:36.163
But we didn't get the tickets, Charlie, because
the guy saw you push me in front of his car.

07:36.248 --> 07:37.998
Yeah, that's true.
We didn't get the tickets.

07:38.083 --> 07:40.334
So you guys tried to scam
your way into the game...

07:40.418 --> 07:42.336
by throwing each other
in front of cars...

07:42.420 --> 07:44.839
with the hopes of extorting tickets
from the drivers.

07:44.923 --> 07:48.759
Let the record show that the three of us do
not condone the actions of the two of them.

07:48.844 --> 07:51.971
The record will show everything.
You can stop saying that.

07:52.055 --> 07:54.056
Are you sure?
'Cause she's not typing very quickly.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.808
[Frank]
It's shorthand. She's getting the gist.

07:55.892 --> 07:59.562
I don't appreciate being paraphrased.
I choose my words very deliberately.

07:59.646 --> 08:02.106
- Get back to your case.
- Okay.

08:02.190 --> 08:05.109
So anyway, the three of us are back at
their apartment trying to get the tickets,

08:05.193 --> 08:07.111
and Mac is scaling the building.

08:07.195 --> 08:10.114
[Grunts] Well, it's just I couldn't
get a good grip, you know?

08:10.198 --> 08:12.783
- Is it the grip? Is the grip the problem?
- Hey, you guys.

08:12.868 --> 08:15.202
Look, I found
this garden hose. All right?

08:15.287 --> 08:17.538
I'm gonna use it to pump
fresh air into the building...

08:17.622 --> 08:19.498
and breathe into it
like a scuba diver.

08:19.624 --> 08:22.209
That actually seems like it could work.
Yeah. Let's give it a shot.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.712
I'll try it out. Okay.
I'll go- Yeah.

08:24.796 --> 08:27.548
[Grunts] Go, go, go.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.967
[Groans]
Okay. How is it?

08:30.051 --> 08:32.635
[Muffled Shouting] What?

08:32.761 --> 08:35.514
I'll get-
Yeah! You're in?

08:35.640 --> 08:38.517
World Series, here we come!
All right!

08:38.643 --> 08:40.936
Pregame! Pregaming!
Let's pregame.

08:41.020 --> 08:44.440
All right, Dee. Let's get back to this
player selection conversation, okay?

08:44.524 --> 08:46.066
'Cause I got some-
got some thoughts.

08:46.151 --> 08:48.569
Yeah, I've been thinking about it.
Ryan Howard, right?

08:48.653 --> 08:50.613
Mmm.
[Groans]

08:50.739 --> 08:53.574
What? Look, if it's me, I'm going
Chase Utley 100% of the time.

08:53.700 --> 08:57.119
He's a power-hitting second baseman.
Do you know how rare that is in the National League?

08:57.245 --> 08:59.622
And he's hot, which is number one on my list.
Of course he is.

08:59.748 --> 09:03.250
But I really like Ryan Howard.
You're kissin' Chase Utley, and that's it.

09:03.335 --> 09:06.003
Why are you pushing Chase Utley on me?
It's starting to get weird.

09:06.087 --> 09:08.422
Okay, look.
I have a plan, all right?

09:08.506 --> 09:11.926
And it involves you getting this letter to
him when you get out there to kiss him.

09:12.010 --> 09:14.845
I have given this to Major
League Baseball, his lawyer,

09:14.930 --> 09:16.555
his manager, his mom,

09:16.640 --> 09:19.391
and he has not gotten back to me,
which means he hasn't gotten it yet.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.852
So just-
Okay. What is in this letter?

09:21.937 --> 09:24.438
That's none of your business, all right?
Just get it to Chase.

09:24.522 --> 09:27.900
Did you write a love letter
to Chase Utley? Is that...

09:29.569 --> 09:31.612
In a lot of ways,
yes, I do love him,

09:31.696 --> 09:34.657
but that is not a love letter in the
way that you're thinking of it, okay?

09:34.783 --> 09:37.618
There's nothing sexual or- Okay.
That sounds good. I'm gonna read it.

09:37.702 --> 09:40.079
Pal around and-
Yeah, read it!

09:40.205 --> 09:42.039
"Dear Chase"- Oh, shit!
There's stickers! Yeah.

09:42.165 --> 09:44.166
My God. Oh, this is good.
You gotta jazz it up.

09:44.292 --> 09:47.336
Yeah, you sure do. You sure do.
I want to make it pop.

09:47.420 --> 09:52.258
"Dear Chase, I feel like I can call you Chase
because you and me are so much alike."

09:52.342 --> 09:55.094
Really? "I would love
to meet you someday.

09:55.178 --> 09:57.304
"It would be great
to have a catch.

09:57.389 --> 10:02.059
"I know I can't throw as fast as you, but I
think you would be impressed with my speed.

10:03.395 --> 10:06.647
"I love your hair.
You run fast.

10:06.731 --> 10:09.650
"Did you have a good
relationship with your father?

10:09.734 --> 10:11.443
"Me neither.

10:11.569 --> 10:14.154
"These are all things we can talk
about, and more. [Mouths Words]

10:14.281 --> 10:18.409
I know you have not been getting my letters
because I know you would write back if you did."

10:18.493 --> 10:21.996
"And I hope you write back this time
and we get to be good friends.

10:22.122 --> 10:27.167
I am sure our relationship would be a real home run.

10:29.671 --> 10:32.172
Well, if you-
if you read it out of context...

10:32.257 --> 10:34.258
There's no right context.
[Whistles]

10:34.342 --> 10:36.427
- Strike that from the record, please!
- No, leave that on the record.

10:36.511 --> 10:38.804
- That one stays on the record.
- Can we get back to your case?

10:38.930 --> 10:41.432
Let's move on, huh? Shall we move on?
We're gonna move on.

10:41.516 --> 10:42.975
Sorry about that, Your Honor.
Whoo!

10:43.059 --> 10:45.519
My God!

10:45.603 --> 10:47.688
Wow! Wow.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.940
Okay. Okay.
[Laughing]

10:50.025 --> 10:52.985
Hey, what were you hoping
to accomplish with this?

10:53.111 --> 10:55.487
I'm hoping that he reads
the letter- Uh-huh.

10:55.572 --> 10:58.407
And realizes that he's always
wanted a younger brother.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.200
Younger brother?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

11:00.285 --> 11:02.369
That guy's, like, five years younger than you.
You know that, right?

11:02.495 --> 11:05.539
Is he really? Are you kidding me?
He seems- Yeah- Oh, shit!

11:05.623 --> 11:07.541
- The hose is gone. Oh, God.
- Oh, shit.

11:07.625 --> 11:10.085
He's in there
breathing the poison.

11:10.211 --> 11:12.212
We gotta get those tickets.
I gotta get to Chase! Goddamn it.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.630
Okay, hold on.
[Inhaling]

11:13.715 --> 11:15.841
Oh, the poison is so thick!

11:15.967 --> 11:18.302
Oh! Oh!
This hallway is really bad!

11:18.386 --> 11:20.012
There he is!

11:20.138 --> 11:22.097
Run! Get him! Frank!
Frank!

11:22.223 --> 11:24.558
Frank! Hey, where are the tickets?
[Groaning]

11:24.684 --> 11:27.436
Where are the tickets?
Leave me here to die!

11:27.520 --> 11:30.564
- No, come on! Where are the goddamn tickets?
- I don't know where...

11:30.690 --> 11:32.358
I can't find 'em.
I'll find them!

11:32.484 --> 11:34.943
I left 'em on the coffee table!
Get 'em!

11:35.028 --> 11:37.488
The bug bomb bastards took 'em!

Hey. Yo!
How are you feeling, buddy?

12:13.608 --> 12:16.902
I'm in a great deal of pain, Charlie.
I was just blasted by a car.

12:16.986 --> 12:19.238
Yeah, I know.
You got creamed, but check it out.

12:19.364 --> 12:23.450
I got you a soft pretzel dog!
Screw your goddamn soft pretzel, you son of a bitch!

12:23.576 --> 12:26.829
I might be bleeding internally!
Dude!

12:26.913 --> 12:29.706
That's the Philly Phrenetic up there, man!
Maybe I'll go talk some shop with him!

12:29.791 --> 12:32.209
A little Green Man!
He can get us in the game, dude!

12:32.293 --> 12:34.837
Ow!
[Gasps] The Phrenetic!

12:37.382 --> 12:39.716
Yo! Hey! Hey!
[Laughing]

12:39.801 --> 12:43.637
Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Philly Phrenetic!
Philly Phrenetic!

12:43.721 --> 12:46.140
Huge fan, man!
Seriously. Big time.

12:46.224 --> 12:49.476
Are you serious? Do you mean that?
Ha-ha! Bring it in, man.

12:49.561 --> 12:52.187
Bring it in. Ah, yeah!
All right. Now, seriously.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.648
Man to man, mascot to mascot,

12:54.732 --> 12:57.651
I was wondering maybe if you could
help get me in the game, you know,

12:57.735 --> 12:59.403
maybe hook me up
with a Green Man routine.

12:59.487 --> 13:02.489
We do it at the stadium
together. So...

13:02.574 --> 13:04.825
All right, now-
I'm trying to talk to you, dude.

13:04.909 --> 13:08.036
I'm trying to have a conversation
with you, you're belly bumping me.

13:09.747 --> 13:11.832
All right. I'll give you...

13:11.916 --> 13:14.418
All right, don't big league me now here, man.
Don't big league...

13:14.502 --> 13:17.504
Look, I'm trying to have a conversation
with the man behind the mask!

13:17.589 --> 13:20.549
I feel like you're big leaguing me, dude!
Are you taking me seriously?

13:27.098 --> 13:28.807
# And this mother party hype #
Yeah!

13:28.892 --> 13:30.976
That guy's beating
on the Phrenetic.

13:31.102 --> 13:33.604
Dude, is that a hate crime?
Nah, it's not a hate crime.

13:33.730 --> 13:36.273
You want to hammer his ass anyway?
Definitely.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.233
# Let me hear you say
whoomp, there it is #

13:38.359 --> 13:40.319

Where you going, dude? Ow!

13:47.160 --> 13:49.161
Goddamn it!
What happened to you?

13:49.245 --> 13:51.580
Charlie pushed me in front of a goddamn car.
That's what happened.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.500
- You look terrible.
- Why are your eyes all filled with blood?

13:54.584 --> 13:57.836
- On account of the poison. - Dude, where were you going?
We gotta get in the stadium.

13:57.962 --> 14:00.255
Look, it's starting to get packed.
Just forget about it, okay?

14:00.340 --> 14:03.175
It's impossible to get into that stadium.
Trust me. Take my word for it.

14:03.259 --> 14:06.136
No, that's not good enough!
We've gotta get in so Dee can kiss Chase Utley and...

14:06.221 --> 14:08.597
Well, how the hell are you planning
on getting in there, Mac?

14:08.723 --> 14:11.892
Uh- You put me on the spot! First thing
that comes to my head, scaling the facade.

14:11.976 --> 14:15.771
I know I soured on that earlier, but I believe
that is my mind telling me I have it in me!

14:15.855 --> 14:18.398
I hate to tell you this, bro, but you
do not have the core strength...

14:18.483 --> 14:20.734
to scale the facade of
Citizens Bank- you just don't.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.904
What? I work out all the time!
You only work out your glamour muscles, and you know it.

14:24.030 --> 14:26.740
I work out my core!
No, you do not work out your core.

14:26.824 --> 14:29.201
You're totally arm heavy.
You're all bi's and tri's.

14:29.285 --> 14:31.537
And everything else
is just fat and ribs.

14:31.663 --> 14:35.415
Bro, I can do way more push-ups than you,
and that's like 16 different muscle groups.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.918
That is beyond retarded,
what you're saying right now.

14:38.002 --> 14:42.005
I can do way more push-ups than you
even though I was just hit by a car.

14:44.926 --> 14:49.638
One, two, three, four, five...

14:49.764 --> 14:53.433
Six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11-
All right, enough!

14:53.518 --> 14:56.144
- Stop it!
- All right.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.105
But you get my point,
Your Honor,

14:58.231 --> 15:00.899
and you could see that Mac was
slowing down at the end there. What?

15:00.984 --> 15:04.027
And let the record show that that is because
he only works out his glamour muscles.

15:04.112 --> 15:06.321
No, that's- That's bullshit!
I did, like, three more than you!

15:06.447 --> 15:10.075
Yeah, but you were- I wasn't slowing down.
Put that on the record!

15:10.159 --> 15:12.536
Strike that from the record.
I don't think you did three more.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.955
- Oh, no! You saw it! She saw it!
- I need this story...

15:15.081 --> 15:18.584
[Charlie] Sustained.
To come to an end soon.

15:18.668 --> 15:21.169
Okay. Fair enough, Your Honor.
I will bring this story to a close very soon.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.171
Okay, so- Let me pick up
where we left off.

15:23.256 --> 15:26.258
We were at the parking lot, and I had just
punched him in the face for cheating...

15:26.342 --> 15:28.719
like he just tried to do
right here in the courtroom.

15:28.803 --> 15:30.304
Stop handing me papers.

15:30.388 --> 15:32.055
[Mac] Why did you
hammer my nose, bro?

15:32.140 --> 15:34.600
I hammered your nose because you
disqualified me for no good reason.

15:34.726 --> 15:36.852
Because you had bad form, dude!
What are you talking about?

15:36.978 --> 15:39.313
You were slowing down, and you
just tried to- That's bullshit.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.732
I got hammered so hard! Yeah?
Well, you deserve it, asshole!

15:41.816 --> 15:43.358
Charlie, who hammered you?

15:43.443 --> 15:45.777
Just some overly passionate
Phillies fans. Who do you think?

15:45.862 --> 15:49.031
You getting hammered by Philly
fans is reminding me of something.

15:49.115 --> 15:51.867
There is a secret tunnel between
the stadium and the Ollidy Inn.

15:51.993 --> 15:54.953
I know, dude! I was telling this guy
about the tunnel! No! That's not true.

15:55.079 --> 15:58.540
They built it 'cause Phillies fans hammer
people all the time! That's a known tunnel.

15:58.666 --> 16:00.334
They gotta get the players out!
It's underground.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.544
Everybody knows about the tunnel.
Let's give the tunnel a shot.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.588
Well, let's get in!
We've got nothing to lose.

16:04.714 --> 16:06.715
It's starting.
You hear that shit? I hear it.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.592
Is that- It seems
like it's gonna rain.

16:08.676 --> 16:11.011
Don't ever disqualify me again for a
bullshit reason, or I'll hammer you again.

16:11.095 --> 16:12.262
Was your form off?

16:14.557 --> 16:17.017
Try to look inconspicuous.
Inconspicuous?

16:17.101 --> 16:19.519
We all look like we've been
in a terrible fight, Frank.

16:19.604 --> 16:22.064
Everybody in here looks like
they've been in a terrible fight.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.608
These two ladies are in the middle
of a terrible fight right now.

16:24.734 --> 16:27.277
Phillies fans are brutal.
There's the elevator. Go! Go!

16:28.821 --> 16:31.448
All right. Which way is it, dude?
Which way? Uh, let's try this way.

16:31.532 --> 16:35.243
The game is about to start, and this
damn thing is not giving me a signal.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.663
Damn it. I don't know if I'm
on board with this plan, man.

16:37.789 --> 16:41.208
I might just go up to the hotel bar and watch
it up there, then join the riot afterwards.

16:41.292 --> 16:44.336
Maybe you're right. If we can't go to the game,
we should be able to watch it somewhere.

16:44.462 --> 16:47.297
We're getting in the game, all right?
[Dee] Just hurry up.

16:47.382 --> 16:49.966
All right, hang on a second.
This looks good down here.

16:50.051 --> 16:52.719
Bingo. Look at this little room.
This has got to be something, right?

16:52.804 --> 16:54.763
All right. Here we go.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.765
It's a linen closet, Charlie.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.476
Yeah. They want you to think
it's a linen closet, Frank!

16:59.560 --> 17:01.728
All right, check behind the
shelves and shit. Why?

17:01.813 --> 17:05.315
In Scooby-Doo, secret tunnels are always
behind shelves. There's gonna be one.

17:05.441 --> 17:08.694
Could we not base our decisions on what does
and doesn't happen in episodes of Scooby-Doo?

17:08.778 --> 17:10.904
Goddamn it! Let's get up to
the bar before the game ends!

17:10.988 --> 17:12.906
Yeah, let's go.
Come on.

17:12.990 --> 17:14.574
Oh, shit. It's locked.
What?

17:14.659 --> 17:16.785
What do you mean, it's locked?
It's locked!

17:16.868 --> 17:19.913
Help! Hey!
Somebody help us!

17:19.997 --> 17:21.915
Guys!

17:21.999 --> 17:24.291
Check this out.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.627
- No!
- [Laughing]

17:26.753 --> 17:28.505
Holy shit.
Is it really?

17:28.631 --> 17:30.674
This is the way. [Charlie] Hang on.
It's dark in here.

17:30.758 --> 17:32.634
But it sounds like it's a tunnel.

17:32.760 --> 17:35.095
[Frank] It's dark as hell in here.
[Dee] I can't see anything.

17:35.179 --> 17:36.680
[Mac] It stinks.
[Dennis] Awful.

17:36.764 --> 17:39.349
[Charlie] Hang on. Hang on.
I found a light.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.396
[Screaming]

17:46.190 --> 17:49.151
[Screaming Continues]

17:49.235 --> 17:51.695
No, no!

17:53.156 --> 17:55.365
[Screaming]

17:55.450 --> 17:58.869
No, stop it! No! Uh-uh! No!

17:58.953 --> 18:03.206
Are you telling me you all found a
dungeon at the bottom of the Ollidy Inn?

18:03.291 --> 18:05.208
No. No, no.
No, no. Not really.

18:05.293 --> 18:08.420
I just added that last part at the
end there to spice the story up...

18:08.504 --> 18:11.548
'cause if I'm being honest, it kind of
seemed like we were losing you for a bit.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.592
Yeah, you weren't paying
attention, but- But now you are.

18:13.676 --> 18:17.721
But the point is, we did get stuck
in that linen closet for six days.

18:17.805 --> 18:20.807
Yes, we did. And as you know, there
was a rain delay on the game.

18:20.933 --> 18:23.894
We missed the game. We missed the riot.
We missed the parade. We missed everything.

18:23.978 --> 18:27.898
Yeah. And the only way we got out is some
maid came after six days to get fresh towels.

18:27.982 --> 18:31.735
Yeah. How does the hotel not run
out of towels for six days?

18:31.819 --> 18:34.988
Let the record show that we question
that hotel's sanitation procedures.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.115
Absolutely.
[Frank] It's a filthy place.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.993
And while we were stuck
in that tiny little room for six days,

18:40.077 --> 18:42.954
surviving only on sink water
and peppermint candies...

18:43.039 --> 18:46.124
and what little bit of riot punch
we had left at that point,

18:46.209 --> 18:48.668
my car accumulated the massive
amount of parking tickets...

18:48.753 --> 18:50.587
that brings us
before you today.

18:50.671 --> 18:54.591
So I submit to you that not only should
I be excused of those parking tickets,

18:54.675 --> 18:57.344
but I think, um, we're really owed
compensation for the entire ordeal.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.387
Compensation.
Because we went through some shit!

18:59.472 --> 19:01.807
- Is that it?
- [Dennis] Um...

19:01.891 --> 19:03.517
I think that about
covers the bases, yeah.

19:03.601 --> 19:07.229
Because I do not find that your
story excuses your behavior.

19:07.313 --> 19:08.980
In fact, it actually seems like...

19:09.065 --> 19:13.026
you committed a litany
of additional crimes in the process.

19:13.110 --> 19:15.695
I order you to pay the original fine.

19:15.780 --> 19:17.239
Next case!

19:17.323 --> 19:19.282
I didn't want to do this,
but I'm gonna have to...

19:19.408 --> 19:21.368
I'm calling kangaroo court on this one!
A kangaroo court!

19:21.494 --> 19:23.995
It's a kangaroo court.
I'm calling kangaroo court because...

19:24.080 --> 19:26.081
And you know what?
I'm gonna toss in my countersuit.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.208
Uh, Charlie Kelly versus
Major League Baseball...

19:28.334 --> 19:30.293
A countersuit, Charlie?
And the Philly Phrenetic.

19:30.419 --> 19:33.004
Don't do it, Charlie. I'm mad that this guy.
He's got a stranglehold...

19:33.130 --> 19:35.090
Oh, boy. Look what's happening.
On the mascot scene.

19:35.174 --> 19:38.134
First of all, I had to call him the Phrenetic.
His name's the Phanatic.

19:38.219 --> 19:41.680
But I'm gonna get sued by Major League
Baseball if I call him the Phanatic.

19:41.764 --> 19:45.392
And let's talk about steroids!
Can we talk about steroids?

19:45.476 --> 19:48.186
Can we talk about steroid abuse?
It's bullshit!

19:48.271 --> 19:51.481
It's ruining the game!
It's ruining it!
