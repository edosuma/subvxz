WEBVTT

00:05.106 --> 00:07.172
<i>Carcharodon carcharias,</i>

00:07.174 --> 00:10.476
aka the great white shark.

00:10.478 --> 00:12.044
Here's the liver.

00:12.046 --> 00:13.545
Huge, isn't it?

00:13.547 --> 00:15.280
It's fatty,
used for buoyancy,

00:15.282 --> 00:17.416
because sharks
don't have swim bladders.

00:17.418 --> 00:20.019
Here's the stomach.

00:20.021 --> 00:21.387
Help me pull it out.

00:21.389 --> 00:23.389
It can expand

00:23.391 --> 00:25.324
to fit whatever the
shark eats, which can

00:25.326 --> 00:27.426
literally can be anything
from... (grunts)

00:27.428 --> 00:29.495
other sharks to old tires.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.034
That looks like a face.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.637
That's bizarre.

00:38.639 --> 00:40.072
Let's have a look.

00:52.153 --> 00:54.453
We should call the police.

00:54.455 --> 00:57.222
Oh, my God.

01:11.472 --> 01:13.072
MAN (over intercom):
Mr. Granger,

01:13.074 --> 01:15.274
please remain completely still.

01:15.276 --> 01:16.675
Here we go.

01:16.677 --> 01:19.411
(machine cranking, buzzing)

01:19.413 --> 01:21.313
¶ ¶

01:40.201 --> 01:42.668
Okay, would you rather
lose your sex organs

01:42.670 --> 01:44.136
or have your lips cut off?

01:44.138 --> 01:46.538
Your 11-year-old daughter
plays this game?

01:46.540 --> 01:48.440
Yeah, but she has questions
like would you rather

01:48.442 --> 01:50.509
have the power of
invisibility or flight?

01:50.511 --> 01:51.844
All right, this is dumb.

01:51.846 --> 01:53.846
You're just stumped.

01:53.848 --> 01:55.714
Flight.

01:55.716 --> 01:57.449
You got to say why.
So I could

01:57.451 --> 01:58.884
fly to work and not
have to be in the car

01:58.886 --> 02:00.486
playing this stupid game
with you.

02:00.488 --> 02:02.187
You're a natural.

02:02.189 --> 02:03.489
Deeks.
Hmm?

02:03.490 --> 02:04.790
Power of invisibility
or flight?

02:04.792 --> 02:06.892
Um...

02:06.894 --> 02:08.460
yeah, I don't know.

02:08.462 --> 02:10.429
I don't know.

02:10.431 --> 02:12.464
That's a good one.

02:14.902 --> 02:17.236
You sleep at the hospital
again last night?

02:17.238 --> 02:18.437
Uh, yeah.

02:18.439 --> 02:20.239
How is she?

02:20.241 --> 02:22.808
You know, she's the...
she's the same.

02:22.810 --> 02:25.277
I mean, but she's better.

02:25.279 --> 02:26.912
Better--

02:26.914 --> 02:28.480
better is good.
Yeah,

02:28.482 --> 02:30.249
yeah, no, it is.

02:30.251 --> 02:32.284
So--

02:32.286 --> 02:33.285
would you rather have

02:33.287 --> 02:35.220
no knees or no elbows?

02:35.222 --> 02:36.455
Sam.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.557
Mm.

02:38.559 --> 02:39.558
You stumped?

02:39.560 --> 02:41.560
No elbows.

02:41.562 --> 02:43.262
That way I
could still

02:43.264 --> 02:46.165
run and shoot.
Wrong answer.

02:46.167 --> 02:47.733
If you don't have elbows,
you can't put

02:47.734 --> 02:49.300
food in your mouth.
You starve, you die.

02:49.303 --> 02:50.602
Ah, touché, Sam.

02:50.604 --> 02:53.172
We got a case.

02:53.174 --> 02:54.339
So I win?

02:54.341 --> 02:57.376
Huh? It's beginner's luck.

03:00.281 --> 03:02.481
So, the person
posing as fish food

03:02.483 --> 03:04.950
was NSA access
analyst Tad Larsen.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.218
His remains
were found

03:06.220 --> 03:08.554
in the stomach
of a 12-foot great white

03:08.556 --> 03:10.255
that was captured
by a fisherman's net

03:10.257 --> 03:13.325
off the coast of Huntington
Beach yesterday morning.

03:13.327 --> 03:15.494
From the digestion, can we tell
what time he was eaten?

03:15.496 --> 03:17.262
According to Dr. Miller,
who found the body,

03:17.264 --> 03:18.697
12 to 24 hours ago.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.766
When was Larsen last seen?
He was

03:20.768 --> 03:23.235
on assignment in San Diego
with his superior,

03:23.237 --> 03:25.571
NSA analyst Bruce Carter.

03:25.573 --> 03:26.772
But NSA hasn't
heard from Carter.

03:26.774 --> 03:28.941
ERIC: However, I was
able to track him

03:28.943 --> 03:30.943
to an apartment
in Long Beach.

03:30.945 --> 03:32.778
Why hasn't he been checking in?

03:32.780 --> 03:34.880
Something's off.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.949
Find Carter
before he moves again.

03:36.951 --> 03:38.984
Quickly.
And, uh...

03:38.986 --> 03:41.420
stay out of the water.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.991
CALLEN:<i> Okay...</i>

03:45.993 --> 03:48.994
would you rather be
eaten alive by a shark

03:48.996 --> 03:51.230
or a giant squid?

03:51.232 --> 03:53.332
I'm sorry
I taught you this game.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.433
(chuckles)
ERIC:
Hey, Carter left the apartment.

03:55.436 --> 03:58.270
He's with a woman,
headed directly towards you.

03:58.272 --> 04:02.241
At least we know they haven't
been eaten by a giant fish.

04:02.243 --> 04:05.010
Bruce Carter,
Agent Callen, NCIS.

04:06.447 --> 04:08.447
You okay? What's going on?

04:08.449 --> 04:10.949
Can I see your ID?

04:15.322 --> 04:17.422
Okay, yeah,
we need to keep moving.
Whoa,

04:17.424 --> 04:18.790
slow down a second.

04:18.792 --> 04:20.359
We're here to help.

04:20.361 --> 04:21.760
Uh...

04:21.762 --> 04:25.397
okay, yeah, let's find
someplace we can talk.

04:26.467 --> 04:27.566
CALLEN:
Let's go over here.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.337
And you are?

04:32.339 --> 04:33.505
Jolene Townsend.

04:33.507 --> 04:35.274
NSA finance and
accounting analyst.

04:35.276 --> 04:37.809
You know one of our coworkers
was found inside of a shark

04:37.811 --> 04:39.678
this morning.
That's why we're here.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.513
And another analyst has been
missing for three days--

04:41.515 --> 04:43.015
Gary Dill.

04:43.017 --> 04:45.350
Any idea why this has happened?
We were in

04:45.352 --> 04:48.854
San Diego because we discovered
an ISIS cell in Mexico

04:48.856 --> 04:50.022
trying to get across the border.

04:50.024 --> 04:52.291
Dill and Larsen
tracked them

04:52.293 --> 04:54.326
from Syria to
Germany to Mexico.

04:54.328 --> 04:56.762
E-mail, text,
phone conversations.

04:56.764 --> 04:58.964
Then they realized ISIS
had discovered the surveillance

04:58.966 --> 05:01.500
and somehow they tracked it
back to Dill and Larsen.

05:01.502 --> 05:03.402
If an ISIS cell
found Larsen,

05:03.404 --> 05:05.871
it would be easy for them
to extract information from him.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.973
What kind of information?

05:07.975 --> 05:09.007
Our names.

05:09.009 --> 05:12.311
ISIS going after NSA analysts.

05:12.313 --> 05:14.413
That's audacious.

05:14.415 --> 05:16.315
Our intelligence
indicates they're

05:16.317 --> 05:18.884
trying to move at least a dozen
agents across the border.

05:18.886 --> 05:21.019
Well, what about
this other analyst, Dill?

05:21.021 --> 05:22.754
You think he's dead, too?

05:22.756 --> 05:25.357
He hasn't responded
to any communication.

05:25.359 --> 05:27.092
Okay.

05:27.094 --> 05:28.860
We'll take you into
protective custody.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.529
We're not staying in L.A.

05:30.531 --> 05:32.331
If you want to escort
us to the airport,

05:32.333 --> 05:35.367
that would be helpful, but we're
going back to Washington today.

05:35.369 --> 05:37.536
Okay,

05:37.538 --> 05:40.072
whatever we can do
to help.

05:40.074 --> 05:41.073
Eric.
Yeah?

05:41.075 --> 05:42.708
We're looking
for a Gary Dill.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.443
Works for NSA as a tech.
Why don't you see

05:44.445 --> 05:46.345
if you can find him here
or down in San Diego.

05:46.347 --> 05:47.612
(tires screeching)
Got it.

05:47.614 --> 05:49.081
SAM:
Gun! Move!

05:49.083 --> 05:50.482
Get down, get down!

05:51.552 --> 05:52.751
Get down, get down, get down!

05:55.389 --> 05:57.122
(gunshots continuing)

06:13.707 --> 06:15.140
Come on!

06:16.076 --> 06:17.476
Go, go, go!

06:22.683 --> 06:23.882
Anybody hit?

06:23.884 --> 06:24.950
No, we're okay.
You call this okay?

06:40.100 --> 06:42.167
ERIC: Sam, Callen,
no sign of the shooter's car

06:42.169 --> 06:43.935
on any of the traffic cams.

06:43.937 --> 06:46.605
I'm sending you a headshot.
Get me an ID.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.073
On it.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.108
Larsen and Dill had access to
all of our personnel records--

06:50.110 --> 06:53.111
home addresses,
my husband's name.

06:53.113 --> 06:56.448
He could have pulled pictures
of my kids off of Facebook.

06:56.450 --> 06:58.183
Okay, we're moving now.

06:58.185 --> 07:00.886
NSA security has
set up a pickup location.
Wait a minute.

07:00.888 --> 07:03.555
This was a shooting incident.
The FBI

07:03.557 --> 07:05.023
will need to speak to you.
This is a

07:05.025 --> 07:07.826
classified case. My agency
is taking care of our security.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.461
Let me go.

07:10.197 --> 07:12.130
Let me go.
GRANGER (on comms):
Let 'em go, Sam.

07:14.001 --> 07:15.133
All right.

07:21.008 --> 07:23.208
NELL:
Using facial recognition,

07:23.210 --> 07:26.077
we found a man who matches
Gary Dill's description. He was

07:26.079 --> 07:28.079
court-ordered
into a California

07:28.081 --> 07:30.015
Department of Mental
Health hospital in Irvine

07:30.017 --> 07:31.750
to face evaluation after

07:31.752 --> 07:33.919
indecent exposure charges.
He was admitted

07:33.921 --> 07:36.755
under the name Noah Leipzig.
This happened

07:36.757 --> 07:38.924
three days ago, same time
Larsen disappeared.

07:38.926 --> 07:41.059
We sure it's him?
ERIC:
No, but an NSA

07:41.061 --> 07:43.028
access analyst
could have the resources

07:43.030 --> 07:44.763
to backstop
a fake identity.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.097
Find out if it's real.

07:46.099 --> 07:48.033
SAM:
NSA share any
other information

07:48.035 --> 07:49.768
about this ISIS cell?

07:49.770 --> 07:51.636
Radio silence.
They might be closing ranks

07:51.638 --> 07:53.104
after the security breach.

07:53.106 --> 07:54.873
Well, we shouldn't wait.

07:54.875 --> 07:56.475
If ISIS operatives
are in Los Angeles

07:56.477 --> 07:57.943
going after an NSA agent...

07:57.945 --> 07:59.744
They're protecting
a large operation.
We need to go

07:59.746 --> 08:01.112
undercover at that hospital.

08:01.114 --> 08:02.948
SAM:
If it is Dill, we can
get close to him,

08:02.950 --> 08:04.616
see what he knows
about this ISIS cell.

08:04.618 --> 08:06.585
Okay, flag on the play.
Intentional grounding.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.653
Neither one of you
can pull off crazy.

08:10.257 --> 08:12.123
You're not going in, Deeks.
What?

08:12.125 --> 08:13.992
What are you talking about?
Homeless Artie--

08:13.994 --> 08:16.862
he-he hears voices, he has PTSD.

08:16.864 --> 08:18.129
Even without Homeless Artie,

08:18.131 --> 08:20.165
Deeks is perfect
for this assignment.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.600
He's not wrong.

08:21.602 --> 08:24.236
He has a personal obligation
at the moment.

08:24.238 --> 08:26.638
No deep-cover ops.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.139
Sam will go in.

08:28.141 --> 08:29.508
Me?

08:29.510 --> 08:31.109
(chuckles)
You're the recluse with no

08:31.111 --> 08:32.711
long-term social attachments.

08:32.713 --> 08:35.514
Callen, you do have issues.

08:35.516 --> 08:37.048
Excuse me?

08:37.050 --> 08:38.950
I have access
to your personnel file,

08:38.952 --> 08:40.685
your psych evaluations.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.120
Knew it.

08:42.122 --> 08:43.255
You're going in.

08:43.257 --> 08:44.956
Get him
backstopped

08:44.958 --> 08:46.658
and into the system.
Throw in a court-ordered

08:46.660 --> 08:48.260
psych evaluation
for a double murder.

08:48.262 --> 08:50.896
With a history
of killing small animals.

08:50.898 --> 08:53.298
Mm, that's so Callen.
Totally.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.002
Good luck.

08:59.673 --> 09:02.040
All right, stand tall.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.943
Lift your knee.

09:04.945 --> 09:07.012
Good.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.115
You're doing well,
Kensi, keep going.

09:10.117 --> 09:11.216
I look like a drunk toddler.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.818
Just a few more steps.

09:15.088 --> 09:16.154
That's time.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.223
That wasn't so bad, was it?

09:20.160 --> 09:22.627
One last thing
for today.

09:22.629 --> 09:25.096
Now that your spinal cord's
been exposed

09:25.098 --> 09:27.032
to the sensory information
of walking,

09:27.034 --> 09:29.568
I'm gonna have you try
standing on your own.

09:43.717 --> 09:45.350
You ready?

09:45.352 --> 09:46.751
Yeah.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.720
Okay, concentrate on
keeping your core strong

09:48.722 --> 09:50.655
and your back
straight as you take

09:50.657 --> 09:52.624
your hands off
the walker.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.201
Sorry, I'll try that again.
Okay.

10:03.203 --> 10:04.336
Take your time.

10:13.246 --> 10:15.013
Nope. Damn it. Nope.

10:15.015 --> 10:18.283
That's okay. It
takes a while.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.818
Okay.

10:23.790 --> 10:26.291
There you go.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.193
Yup...

10:29.096 --> 10:30.362
Ha-ha.

10:30.364 --> 10:32.631
Okay, I can do better than that.
And you will.

10:32.633 --> 10:34.699
That's enough for today.
No, no,

10:34.701 --> 10:37.035
I only stood up for, like, two
seconds. I can-I can keep going.

10:37.037 --> 10:39.270
That's not how therapy works.
You do too much too soon,

10:39.272 --> 10:41.272
you can actually set
yourself backwards.

10:41.274 --> 10:43.908
Okay, look,
I can't stand, I can't walk,

10:43.910 --> 10:45.210
I can't use my left hand.

10:45.212 --> 10:47.212
How much worse could it get?

10:47.214 --> 10:49.347
Just look around you.

10:58.225 --> 10:59.391
INTAKE NURSE:
There are no cell phones,

10:59.393 --> 11:01.192
alcoholic beverages,
drugs,

11:01.194 --> 11:02.727
cigarettes, poison,

11:02.729 --> 11:05.230
glue, firearms,

11:05.232 --> 11:06.798
weapons, cameras,
recording devices,

11:06.800 --> 11:08.733
or pets allowed.

11:08.735 --> 11:10.735
We find them, it's a crime.

11:10.737 --> 11:12.937
And you will
be prosecuted.

11:20.213 --> 11:21.746
PATIENT:
Set them up.

11:21.748 --> 11:23.281
It's gonna be my move.

11:29.256 --> 11:31.322
(indistinct P.A. announcement)

11:36.930 --> 11:38.730
(quietly):
Here's the phone.

11:38.732 --> 11:40.298
Thanks, man.

11:43.403 --> 11:45.470
(indistinct
conversations nearby)

11:47.240 --> 11:49.107
MAN: All right, you guys
have about five minutes,

11:49.109 --> 11:50.775
then we're going
to lock it up.

11:50.777 --> 11:51.776
Let's go.

11:51.778 --> 11:53.278
I got to be
the first call.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.146
Just chill out, man.
I just got the thing.

11:55.148 --> 11:56.698
Look at this guy.

11:56.699 --> 11:58.249
I love this guy.
Hey, buddy.
You're growing a beard.

11:58.251 --> 11:59.918
Don't you know if you keep
letting it grow

11:59.920 --> 12:01.119
it's gonna take over
your whole face.

12:03.023 --> 12:05.490
MAN (over P.A.):
Officer Howard to Admin.

12:05.492 --> 12:07.826
Officer Howard
to Admin.

12:07.828 --> 12:10.428
Well, I'm never surfing again.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.063
What did you find?

12:12.065 --> 12:14.365
My buddy at the LAPD
Gang and Narcotics Division

12:14.367 --> 12:16.201
said the Banuelos cartel

12:16.203 --> 12:18.303
has recently been putting
people into the ocean,

12:18.305 --> 12:21.272
chumming the water
to attract sharks...

12:21.274 --> 12:23.274
To get them to talk.
Exactly.

12:23.276 --> 12:25.377
How messed up is that?
Ugh.

12:25.378 --> 12:27.479
ISIS could have been working
with the Banuelos cartel.

12:27.481 --> 12:29.447
Using their drug tunnels

12:29.449 --> 12:31.950
to transport men and/or
weapons across the border.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.184
That means the ISIS cell

12:33.186 --> 12:35.186
may not be in the U.S. yet.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.455
Using the cartel
to do their dirty work.

12:37.457 --> 12:40.859
If Larsen's in the water
surrounded by sharks...

12:40.861 --> 12:42.026
Then he definitely gave up

12:42.028 --> 12:43.194
everything he knew
about his team.

12:43.196 --> 12:44.896
Can you blame him?

12:44.898 --> 12:46.297
No.

12:46.299 --> 12:48.933
I'd like to make
a phone call.

12:50.337 --> 12:53.204
You have an hour
for the week.

12:53.206 --> 12:54.839
Put your ID badge here.

12:54.841 --> 12:56.908
(monitor beeps)

12:57.911 --> 13:01.246
Clock's running, go ahead.

13:02.249 --> 13:04.315
(phone buttons beeping)

13:07.087 --> 13:08.286
(line rings)

13:08.288 --> 13:10.355
(phone rings)

13:14.294 --> 13:16.861
(phone ringing nearby)

13:16.863 --> 13:18.997
You stole my phone.
No.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.532
No, no, no, no. I have no
idea how this got in here.

13:20.534 --> 13:22.534
(grunts)

13:22.536 --> 13:24.202
You come near my room

13:24.204 --> 13:25.870
or my stuff...

13:25.872 --> 13:27.205
I'll bite your nose off.

13:27.207 --> 13:29.207
I didn't take it.
I've bitten people's noses

13:29.209 --> 13:31.342
off before, I will do it...

13:31.344 --> 13:33.545
(grunting)

13:33.547 --> 13:36.147
Xanax dose a little low?

13:36.149 --> 13:37.415
You leave him alone.

13:37.417 --> 13:40.852
(panting):
It's three on one, B.

13:46.226 --> 13:48.293
I'll take you all at once
or one at a time.

13:51.298 --> 13:54.232
(grunting)

13:56.403 --> 13:58.536
I guess that makes it
two on one, B.

14:00.540 --> 14:03.441
Nah.

14:05.111 --> 14:07.445
Looks like one on one, B.

14:12.452 --> 14:15.453
You stay away from my stuff.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.123
Thanks.

14:19.125 --> 14:21.359
I don't like bullies.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.194
David Earl.

14:23.196 --> 14:26.865
Noah Leipzig...
Uh, nice to meet you.

14:26.867 --> 14:27.932
Nice to meet you, Noah.

14:39.045 --> 14:43.381
But there are other patients
who say that you're aggressive.

14:43.383 --> 14:46.417
One man's aggressive
is another man's assertive.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.269
Maybe instead of this,

14:48.270 --> 14:50.120
can we talk about getting back
the foosball table?

14:50.123 --> 14:51.990
Yeah, everybody
really liked foosball.

14:51.992 --> 14:53.558
Besides, who's saying
I'm aggressive?

14:53.560 --> 14:55.960
I don't even talk
to half you people.

14:55.962 --> 14:57.262
Foosball

14:57.264 --> 14:59.931
was causing arguments,
so I removed it.

14:59.933 --> 15:02.133
Okay, let's move on.

15:02.135 --> 15:03.902
Noah.

15:03.904 --> 15:05.970
Have you continued
to have paranoid thoughts

15:05.972 --> 15:08.306
about the government?

15:08.308 --> 15:11.242
That was a private discussion
from our session.

15:11.244 --> 15:14.545
It will help you to have it
come out publicly,

15:14.547 --> 15:16.414
so everyone here can help you
with this.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.650
Do you still think
the government

15:18.652 --> 15:20.919
is trying to kill you?

15:20.921 --> 15:24.222
Yes. I mean,
not the whole government,

15:24.224 --> 15:25.957
just some people in it.

15:25.959 --> 15:28.126
Why?

15:28.128 --> 15:32.964
(sighs)
I told you, I know things, okay?

15:32.966 --> 15:34.999
But how could you know
secret things

15:35.001 --> 15:37.669
about the government, Noah?

15:37.671 --> 15:39.637
This is paranoia.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.306
I don't think he's paranoid.

15:44.144 --> 15:46.077
Mr. David Earl, welcome.

15:46.079 --> 15:47.178
Do you know Noah?

15:47.180 --> 15:48.613
No, but I believe him.

15:48.615 --> 15:52.317
And I think it's wrong
that you're just dismissing him.

15:53.954 --> 15:55.186
We're working
through our issues.

15:55.188 --> 15:57.221
You're working through,
or you're judging?

15:57.223 --> 15:59.324
Now, what about your issues?
You want to throw those out

15:59.326 --> 16:01.726
in the circle and have them
picked apart and ridiculed?

16:03.196 --> 16:06.664
What about you,
Dr., uh, Tannen?

16:06.666 --> 16:09.634
Kind of a slight build.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.703
Bet you got picked on when you
were little, didn't you?

16:11.705 --> 16:15.073
But your parents
didn't support you.

16:15.075 --> 16:17.241
So you came up with a whole
superiority complex

16:17.243 --> 16:19.744
to try and cope with it.

16:19.746 --> 16:21.245
How close am I?

16:21.247 --> 16:22.714
(clapping)

16:22.716 --> 16:25.416
(laughing)

16:25.418 --> 16:28.052
SAM:
<i> We're just a little concerned.</i>

16:28.054 --> 16:30.221
I'm all right, man.

16:30.223 --> 16:32.156
And considering
the circumstances,

16:32.158 --> 16:33.624
Kensi is all right.

16:33.626 --> 16:36.260
HETTY:
Mr. Deeks,

16:36.262 --> 16:37.695
the first solution
to the problem

16:37.697 --> 16:41.099
is an honest assessment
of the problem.

16:41.101 --> 16:42.266
I understand,
and I'm doing that.

16:42.268 --> 16:44.068
SAM:
No, you're not.
What?

16:44.070 --> 16:45.570
You're not okay.

16:45.572 --> 16:48.406
And she most definitely
is not okay.

16:48.408 --> 16:51.142
I've seen people go
through this before.

16:51.144 --> 16:53.111
It's brutal.

16:53.113 --> 16:55.713
Everything's gonna be fine.

16:55.715 --> 16:57.115
Maybe.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.750
But it isn't right now.

17:00.053 --> 17:02.020
We want to offer you time off.

17:02.022 --> 17:03.721
I don't need time off.
ERIC: Sorry to interrupt.

17:03.723 --> 17:06.190
It's about the case.

17:06.192 --> 17:07.759
Go on.

17:07.761 --> 17:09.794
We cross-checked
NSA, CIA, FBI,

17:09.796 --> 17:14.098
DHS... None have a current
investigation of ISIS agents

17:14.100 --> 17:15.633
attempting to cross
the U.S.-Mexican border.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.468
None?

17:17.470 --> 17:18.603
Nada.

17:20.073 --> 17:22.507
I want to have another
conversation with Carter.

17:22.509 --> 17:23.775
We don't know
where he is.

17:23.777 --> 17:26.110
You don't, but I do.

17:26.112 --> 17:27.245
When he got squirrelly
this morning,

17:27.247 --> 17:28.713
I put a tracker on him.

17:28.715 --> 17:31.049
HETTY:
Very nice, Mr. Hanna.

17:31.051 --> 17:32.350
By all means,
bring him in.

17:32.352 --> 17:33.618
I'll go with you.

17:35.822 --> 17:37.789
(phone buzzing)

17:41.161 --> 17:42.260
Everything okay?

17:42.262 --> 17:44.162
Yeah. It's Kensi's therapist.

17:44.164 --> 17:46.097
She just had a tough morning.

17:46.099 --> 17:47.665
You go.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.233
Granger will do it with me.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.469
No. She's fine.

17:51.471 --> 17:54.172
Let's go talk to Carter;
I'll head over after.

17:56.209 --> 17:58.276
Okay.

17:59.145 --> 18:01.079
(knock on door)

18:01.081 --> 18:03.081
Hey.

18:03.083 --> 18:04.816
That was amazing.

18:04.818 --> 18:06.952
(chuckles)

18:06.953 --> 18:09.087
I don't think I'm gonna get
a very good evaluation.

18:09.089 --> 18:11.722
Come on in.

18:12.659 --> 18:17.128
By the way, I know
what you were feeling.

18:17.130 --> 18:18.763
I once thought my phone
was tapped.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.364
It was.

18:20.366 --> 18:22.433
(chuckling):
I don't think so.

18:22.435 --> 18:25.203
No. I'm telling you it was.

18:26.706 --> 18:28.506
Why are they after you?

18:30.810 --> 18:33.177
Like I said, I know things.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.280
Are you in here 'cause you're
hiding from them?

18:39.119 --> 18:41.152
DANTE:
Hey, Davey.

18:45.225 --> 18:47.391
I need to talk
to both of you.

18:47.393 --> 18:49.527
Then talk.

18:52.165 --> 18:55.166
Say it like
we practiced.

18:56.402 --> 18:58.369
(Dante sighs)

18:58.371 --> 19:00.738
I just want to say...

19:00.740 --> 19:04.442
that I'm really sorry
about earlier.

19:04.444 --> 19:07.778
Noah, I would
never, ever

19:07.780 --> 19:08.880
bite your nose off.

19:08.882 --> 19:10.314
I'm not that kind of guy.

19:10.316 --> 19:12.617
It's okay.

19:12.619 --> 19:15.620
And you seem like
such a great guy.

19:15.622 --> 19:17.922
I would just love to sit and
talk and share our stories.

19:17.924 --> 19:20.725
Yeah... share some stories...

19:20.727 --> 19:22.393
sometime.
Yeah?

19:22.395 --> 19:23.661
Yeah, okay,
cool, man.

19:23.663 --> 19:24.795
Come on.

19:24.797 --> 19:25.796
Give me a hug.
Yeah.

19:25.798 --> 19:27.198
Okay, that's great.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.266
All right.
DANTE: See?

19:28.268 --> 19:29.200
CALLEN:
Yeah, that's-that's great.

19:29.202 --> 19:31.269
(car engine revving)

19:31.838 --> 19:33.604
SAM:
Oh.

19:33.606 --> 19:36.474
Thought you'd be
in Washington by now.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.242
We're on our way.

19:38.244 --> 19:40.745
Where's your NSA
security team?

19:40.747 --> 19:42.947
I'm not answering
any more questions.

19:42.949 --> 19:45.917
Oh, then you're not on your way.

19:45.919 --> 19:47.351
(engine stops)

19:51.524 --> 19:52.857
You know, you can
tell a whole lot

19:52.859 --> 19:54.292
about a person by how they pack.

19:55.595 --> 19:57.495
Th-That's an illegal search.

19:57.497 --> 19:59.964
That is legitimately funny
coming from the NSA.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.832
DEEKS:
Wow. They got...

20:01.834 --> 20:05.369
five, six, seven burn phones.

20:05.371 --> 20:06.938
Uh...

20:06.940 --> 20:08.539
Sam, I got a gun.

20:08.541 --> 20:09.974
Oh... Hands on the wheel.

20:09.976 --> 20:11.776
Hands on the dash.

20:11.778 --> 20:12.977
Don't move.

20:12.979 --> 20:14.412
DEEKS:
Sam.

20:17.383 --> 20:20.318
Take a look at this.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.286
Oh.

20:22.288 --> 20:23.354
Clearly, we are working
for the wrong government agency.

20:38.638 --> 20:40.438
A volunteer will
bring you back up.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.939
Thank you.
Just flag one down.

20:43.509 --> 20:45.576
¶ ¶

20:56.656 --> 20:58.522
(grunts)

21:02.862 --> 21:05.663
(groans)

21:12.872 --> 21:14.939
(exhales)

21:17.644 --> 21:19.677

(chuckling)

21:26.786 --> 21:28.319
Ooh! Sh...

21:28.321 --> 21:29.987
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:29.989 --> 21:31.822
Just stay there
while I get a nurse.

21:31.824 --> 21:33.724
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, hold on, hold on.

21:33.726 --> 21:36.294
Um, can you just help me back
in the chair?

21:36.296 --> 21:38.296
Okay.
Okay.

21:38.298 --> 21:39.363
All right...
(groaning)

21:39.365 --> 21:41.332
(grunting)
Okay.

21:41.334 --> 21:44.835
Okay, we got you.
(groaning)

21:44.837 --> 21:46.570
Oh...

21:46.572 --> 21:47.571
(groans)

21:47.573 --> 21:48.706
Are you sure you don't

21:48.708 --> 21:49.874
want me to get someone else?
I'm good.

21:49.876 --> 21:51.676
Thank you.
Okay.

21:51.678 --> 21:53.044
If you change your mind,

21:53.045 --> 21:54.411
I'm just over there
finishing up my lunch.

21:54.414 --> 21:56.781
Thank you so much,
thank you.

21:56.783 --> 21:58.849
(sighing)

22:02.455 --> 22:04.055
So, we finally
got our ID

22:04.057 --> 22:05.756
on the dead shooter.
We were looking

22:05.758 --> 22:09.026
in all the wrong places until
Deeks mentioned the drug cartel.

22:09.028 --> 22:11.429
His name is Antonio Martinez.

22:11.431 --> 22:13.431
The shooter wasn't ISIS.

22:13.433 --> 22:17.001
He's Mexican and a member
of the Banuelos cartel.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.306
(door opens)

22:22.307 --> 22:23.773
I need to make
my superiors at the NSA

22:23.776 --> 22:25.509
aware of my circumstance.

22:25.511 --> 22:27.912
Oh, so they can sweep in here,
play the top secret card,

22:27.914 --> 22:28.879
and pull you out?

22:28.881 --> 22:31.349
Something like that, yeah.

22:31.351 --> 22:33.084
The shooters who were after you,

22:33.086 --> 22:34.785
they aren't ISIS.

22:34.787 --> 22:35.986
They were members
of the Banuelos

22:35.988 --> 22:37.822
drug cartel.

22:37.823 --> 22:39.657
ISIS could have put a contract
out on us.

22:39.659 --> 22:42.526
Where'd the money
in the car come from?

22:42.528 --> 22:45.830
It's NSA payout money
for informants.

22:45.832 --> 22:47.665
Some very high paid informants.

22:47.667 --> 22:49.133
Call the agency.

22:49.135 --> 22:51.836
Believe me,
it's all accounted for.

22:51.838 --> 22:54.839
I call the agency,
they find out you're here.

22:54.841 --> 22:56.607
They pull you out,

22:56.609 --> 22:59.844
I don't get any of my
questions answered.

22:59.846 --> 23:02.713
Bruce,

23:02.715 --> 23:05.583
I've been doing this
a long time.

23:05.585 --> 23:08.152
I know when I'm hearing lies
of omission.

23:08.154 --> 23:10.554
ERIC:<i> Guys, we can't find</i>
<i> any connection</i>

23:10.556 --> 23:12.857
between Carter
and the Banuelos cartel.

23:12.859 --> 23:14.892
But the NSA released
an extensive

23:14.894 --> 23:17.528
intelligence report in July
on the cartel

23:17.530 --> 23:19.463
produced by-- wait for it--

23:19.465 --> 23:21.832
Jolene Townsend.

23:21.834 --> 23:25.436
You wrote a report on
the Banuelos cartel last year.

23:25.438 --> 23:27.438
I write a lot
of reports.

23:27.440 --> 23:31.108
Interpreting financial
intelligence is-is my job.

23:31.110 --> 23:32.910
Well, the shooter who tried
to kill you

23:32.912 --> 23:34.979
was from the Banuelos cartel.

23:34.981 --> 23:36.947
Really?

23:36.949 --> 23:39.417
Yes, really.

23:39.419 --> 23:41.619
Tell me about the money
in the trunk.

23:41.621 --> 23:42.920
I never saw it before.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.855
It had to be Bruce's.

23:44.857 --> 23:46.824
(whistles)
Wow.

23:46.826 --> 23:49.193
She didn't just throw him
under the bus--

23:49.194 --> 23:51.561
she put it in reverse
and then backed over him.

23:51.564 --> 23:53.063
SAM:
What would you say

23:53.065 --> 23:54.899
if I told you

23:54.901 --> 23:57.635
Jolene Townsend said the money
in the car was yours?

23:57.637 --> 24:00.471
She didn't know
about the payout money.

24:00.473 --> 24:01.939
I wouldn't keep playing
this hand.

24:01.941 --> 24:04.008
It's time to fold, Bruce.

24:04.010 --> 24:06.544
She sold you out without
even a second thought.

24:06.546 --> 24:08.712
Right.

24:08.714 --> 24:11.115
I've been married
for...

24:11.117 --> 24:14.185
22 years. Completely faithful.

24:14.187 --> 24:16.520
And then last week

24:16.522 --> 24:18.789
when Larsen and Dill
went missing,

24:18.791 --> 24:22.560
Jolene... came on to me.

24:22.562 --> 24:25.629
I work for NCIS,
not the morality police.

24:25.631 --> 24:28.065
Tell me something I care about.

24:28.067 --> 24:30.935
The cartel was going after her
and Larsen.

24:30.937 --> 24:33.421
Why?

24:33.422 --> 24:35.906
Ask her about federal civil
asset forfeiture law.

24:35.908 --> 24:39.176
The state seizing the assets
associated with a crime.

24:41.013 --> 24:44.148
Like taking the money
from a drug cartel.

24:44.150 --> 24:45.549
That's right.

24:45.551 --> 24:48.752
And she was really good at it.

24:48.754 --> 24:51.021
So you knew the names,
phone numbers, and addresses

24:51.023 --> 24:53.557
of all the major players
in the Banuelos cartel?

24:53.559 --> 24:55.092
Yeah.

24:55.094 --> 24:58.095
What about bank accounts?

24:58.097 --> 24:59.230
Yeah.

24:59.232 --> 25:00.598
So with the help

25:00.600 --> 25:02.666
of your computer geek, Larsen,

25:02.668 --> 25:04.802
you could transfer money
out of those accounts

25:04.804 --> 25:06.971
as easily
as pulling cash out of an ATM.

25:06.973 --> 25:10.040
And don't tell me the
cash was used to fund

25:10.042 --> 25:11.876
NSA investigations,

25:11.878 --> 25:13.677
'cause that balloon is gonna pop

25:13.679 --> 25:15.746
before you even start
to blow it up.

25:18.951 --> 25:20.651
(sighs)

25:20.653 --> 25:23.254
This whole thing has
nothing to do with ISIS.

25:23.256 --> 25:25.656
Basically, it's just cops
robbing drug dealers,

25:25.658 --> 25:27.658
which is a story that's
been around as long as...

25:27.660 --> 25:30.027
As long as there's been cops
and drug dealers.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.829
NELL:
So, it looks like Jolene has

25:31.831 --> 25:33.564
a few shell companies
with offshore accounts,

25:33.566 --> 25:35.799
totaling around $17 million.

25:35.801 --> 25:37.167
She just wasn't

25:37.169 --> 25:40.004
counting on the cartels
hunting her down.

25:40.006 --> 25:43.140
What about Dill?
Well, we don't even know
if Leipzig is Dill.

25:43.142 --> 25:45.276
All right, Deeks,
this is over. Process Carter

25:45.278 --> 25:48.612
and Townsend to the FBI
and get back to the hospital.

25:49.982 --> 25:53.117
Okay. Thank you.

25:53.119 --> 25:55.185
Thanks.

25:56.188 --> 25:59.023
(door opens, shuts)
I'll go pull Callen out,

25:59.025 --> 26:00.925
bring in Leipzig.

26:00.927 --> 26:02.993
See what he knows.

26:02.995 --> 26:05.062
(indistinct chatter)

26:07.867 --> 26:10.734
You got twos
and jacks.

26:10.736 --> 26:14.138
So, what'd you do
to get in here?

26:14.140 --> 26:16.840
I went shopping
in Whole Foods naked.

26:16.842 --> 26:17.942
I told 'em I had
no money for clothes

26:17.944 --> 26:20.110
after spending it
all on their food.

26:20.112 --> 26:22.112
(chuckles)

26:22.114 --> 26:24.081
You're not crazy at all.

26:24.083 --> 26:28.786
You've got a four-five-six-seven
run in hearts,

26:28.788 --> 26:32.122
three kings, and you need
a three of spades for gin.

26:32.124 --> 26:34.692
You're not crazy either.

26:34.694 --> 26:36.994
That's what scares me.

26:36.996 --> 26:39.163
MAN: Come on,
let's see your arm.

26:39.165 --> 26:41.131
MAN 2:
Man, not so rough.

26:41.133 --> 26:42.132
MAN 1:
Let's go.

26:42.134 --> 26:43.133
MAN 2:
What?

26:43.135 --> 26:45.102
Your ID band.

26:45.104 --> 26:47.071
Let me see.

26:47.073 --> 26:48.606
You ever seen

26:48.608 --> 26:49.607
those guys
before?

26:49.609 --> 26:51.642
No. Never.

26:51.644 --> 26:54.311
Okay, look,

26:54.313 --> 26:56.714
I think I might need your help.

26:56.716 --> 26:58.048
My real name is...

26:58.050 --> 27:00.317
Gary Dill. You work for the NSA.

27:00.319 --> 27:02.319
My name's Callen.

27:02.321 --> 27:04.054
I'm an NCIS agent.

27:04.056 --> 27:05.723
I was guessing FBI.

27:05.725 --> 27:08.859
I discovered a coworker
named Larsen

27:08.861 --> 27:10.961
and his boss, Jolene Townsend,

27:10.963 --> 27:13.130
were stealing money
from the bank account

27:13.132 --> 27:15.966
of a Mexican drug dealer
named Eduardo Banuelos.

27:15.968 --> 27:17.201
So why are you hiding out?

27:17.203 --> 27:19.069
Because I helped Larsen
break through

27:19.071 --> 27:21.138
the Mexican bank's security.

27:21.140 --> 27:23.273
I was told it was
an authorized NSA investigation.

27:23.275 --> 27:25.275
Turns out
it was common thievery.

27:25.277 --> 27:28.912
Well, if you want to call
$17 million common.

27:28.914 --> 27:31.248
In case those guys
aren't orderlies,

27:31.250 --> 27:33.851
let's get you out of here.

27:37.256 --> 27:39.323
¶ ¶

27:51.270 --> 27:52.803
GRANGER:
<i> What have we got?</i>

27:52.805 --> 27:54.338
Going through Townsend's phones,

27:54.340 --> 27:56.907
we found two text messages
to Tijuana, Mexico,

27:56.909 --> 27:59.076
one with Gary Dill's name
and the address

27:59.078 --> 28:00.878
of the state mental hospital.
She must've used

28:00.880 --> 28:02.346
NSA resources
to find him

28:02.348 --> 28:05.082
and then leaked Dill's location
to the cartel.

28:05.084 --> 28:07.151
So she's trying to pin it
on him.

28:07.153 --> 28:09.720
And Dill being dead would make
that a whole lot easier.

28:09.722 --> 28:11.155
How close is Sam
to the hospital?

28:11.157 --> 28:14.158
ERIC:
Um, ten minutes.

28:14.160 --> 28:16.260
Tell him to get there in six.
Yeah.

28:16.262 --> 28:18.128
We need your guys' help.

28:18.130 --> 28:22.099
Hey. What are
brothers for, right?

28:22.101 --> 28:24.168
(men speaking indistinctly)

28:32.111 --> 28:34.078
Looking for Leipzig.

28:34.079 --> 28:36.046
MAN:
He's not here.
(speaking indistinctly)

28:47.259 --> 28:49.326
Got to move.

28:51.263 --> 28:53.764
Didn't we leave this door open?

28:55.101 --> 28:56.433
Hey, hey. You-you got...

28:56.435 --> 28:57.768
you got to help my friend.
You got to help my friend.

28:57.770 --> 29:00.304
I-I need my meds.
I need my meds.

29:00.306 --> 29:01.839
I b-blew my head off
with a shotgun,

29:01.841 --> 29:02.973
and now I got no head, man.

29:02.975 --> 29:05.209
I'm freaking out, man!
Get away from me,

29:05.211 --> 29:07.211
you crazy bastard.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

29:07.213 --> 29:08.479
The only people
that can call crazy people

29:08.481 --> 29:10.447
crazy are crazy people.

29:10.449 --> 29:12.015
That just shows
how ignorant

29:12.017 --> 29:13.484
you...

29:13.486 --> 29:16.253
Okay, call me crazy.

29:19.191 --> 29:21.258
He's got a gun.

29:21.260 --> 29:22.226
MAN:
No way.

29:22.228 --> 29:23.460
(rattling)

29:25.498 --> 29:27.231
Get security out here!

29:27.233 --> 29:29.166
Find a guard, find a guard!

29:30.836 --> 29:32.069
Get security!
Guard!

29:32.071 --> 29:33.837
(indistinct shouting)

29:35.241 --> 29:36.306
Don't move.

29:41.113 --> 29:43.180
Let me see your hands.

29:56.829 --> 29:59.229
Noah Leipzig.

29:59.231 --> 30:02.032
Or is it
Gary Dill?

30:02.034 --> 30:04.168
Come with us.

30:04.170 --> 30:05.235
Move!

30:23.956 --> 30:25.823
How long ago was it?
It was just before

30:25.825 --> 30:27.925
you got here,
like five minutes.

30:27.927 --> 30:29.326
And he switched ID bands
with you?

30:29.328 --> 30:31.195
Yes. They think he's me.

30:31.197 --> 30:33.564
Eric, Nell, you get
into those security cameras yet?

30:33.566 --> 30:34.832
We're scrubbing
through now.

30:34.834 --> 30:36.500
Callen had a GPS tracker,

30:36.502 --> 30:38.335
but we're not seeing the signal.

30:39.338 --> 30:43.507
Sam, they took Callen
in a black GMC cargo van.

30:43.509 --> 30:45.576
(gulls crying in distance)

30:49.048 --> 30:50.180
(speaks Spanish)

30:50.182 --> 30:53.016
This is him,
boss.

30:56.288 --> 30:58.355
(grunting)

31:05.464 --> 31:07.531
(motor whirring)

31:17.276 --> 31:19.943
ERIC: I got some intermittent
hits from the tracker.

31:19.945 --> 31:23.347
It was a weak signal
from Newport Beach

31:23.349 --> 31:25.166
near the Balboa Marina.

31:25.167 --> 31:26.984
M.O. of the cartel
is to put people in the ocean

31:26.986 --> 31:29.386
to interrogate 'em. Keep looking
for that signal. Nell.

31:29.388 --> 31:31.321
Yeah.
I'm sending you a contact
for Tom Olsen.

31:31.323 --> 31:32.956
He's a former SEAL teammate.

31:32.957 --> 31:34.590
I want you to tell him
to have his boat geared up

31:34.593 --> 31:35.893
and ready to go.

31:35.895 --> 31:37.160
I'm on it.

31:46.272 --> 31:48.605
(groans softly)

31:48.607 --> 31:50.207
(grunts)

31:53.112 --> 31:55.178
Mr. Dill,

31:55.180 --> 31:57.648
you like to fish?

31:57.650 --> 31:59.449
Not so much.

31:59.451 --> 32:01.251
Smell makes me
a little queasy.

32:01.253 --> 32:03.353
Ah. I like
to fish.

32:03.355 --> 32:05.389
Only I use humans as bait.

32:09.361 --> 32:11.495
You look like you'd make
a supersized meal.

32:11.497 --> 32:13.163
Why don't you jump in?

32:13.165 --> 32:16.934
You really want
to make fat jokes?

32:21.307 --> 32:24.474
Look, I didn't take
your money, okay?

32:24.476 --> 32:26.009
But I know who did.

32:26.011 --> 32:27.761
Jolene Townsend says it was you.

32:27.762 --> 32:29.512
And my guys tell me that
it was your personal computer

32:29.515 --> 32:32.182
that hacked into my bank, okay?

32:32.184 --> 32:34.117
So where's my money?

32:34.119 --> 32:36.453
Anybody ever tell you

32:36.455 --> 32:38.689
you look
like a Mexican Chevy Chase?

32:40.459 --> 32:42.960
Hey, I meant it as a compliment.

32:42.962 --> 32:44.661
The only reason you're alive now

32:44.663 --> 32:48.198
is the chance that you can help
me get my $17 million back.

32:48.200 --> 32:51.201
Look, let's just go...
just go back in.

32:51.203 --> 32:52.569
I can take you to Townsend.

32:54.306 --> 32:56.073
Put him in the water.

33:03.315 --> 33:05.315
(grunts)

33:09.455 --> 33:12.289
ERIC:
Sam, we had Callen's tracker,

33:12.291 --> 33:13.457
but we just lost it.

33:13.459 --> 33:15.292
(tires screech)

33:17.096 --> 33:18.362
They probably put him
in the water,

33:18.364 --> 33:19.730
that's why you lost the signal.

33:19.732 --> 33:21.331
Send me that last
GPS location.

33:21.333 --> 33:23.400
Boat's ready to go.
Thank you.

33:34.346 --> 33:37.347
You know I've got
Internet out here.

33:37.349 --> 33:39.249
You give me
an account number,

33:39.251 --> 33:40.784
I check it's good,

33:40.786 --> 33:43.220
I might take you back
to the dock.

33:43.222 --> 33:44.521
You got Internet?

33:44.523 --> 33:46.056
We gotta Netflix<i> Caddyshack.</i>

33:46.058 --> 33:48.392
Chevy Chase, comic genius.

33:49.361 --> 33:51.428
Your friend Larsen
wasn't so funny.

33:51.430 --> 33:52.496
He's not my friend, okay?

33:52.498 --> 33:54.498
He and Townsend set me up.

33:54.500 --> 33:58.435
You know, the sharks
bit off Larsen's leg.

33:58.437 --> 34:00.070
But he kept treading water.

34:00.072 --> 34:01.271
Huh?

34:01.273 --> 34:02.472
Imagine trying to swim

34:02.474 --> 34:05.809
while you watch a shark
eat your own leg.

34:06.779 --> 34:08.512
Can't say I'm going to...

34:08.514 --> 34:10.547
enjoy that.

34:11.517 --> 34:13.483
They're just over
a mile away.

34:14.453 --> 34:16.586
I don't want to get
too close and spook 'em.

34:16.588 --> 34:18.755
That boat can be in Mexican
waters inside an hour.

34:18.757 --> 34:22.359
Besides, we used to do two miles
before breakfast.

34:22.361 --> 34:24.461
Wish I could come with.

34:24.463 --> 34:26.229
You and me both.

34:41.513 --> 34:43.346
They're here!

34:43.348 --> 34:44.848
(panting)

34:45.818 --> 34:47.551
BANUELOS:
Oh, not too big.

34:49.455 --> 34:50.754
It's gonna be a lot
of little bites, huh?

34:50.756 --> 34:52.189
(chomps)

34:53.392 --> 34:55.025
You have
an account number for me?

34:55.026 --> 34:56.659
Even if I did,
you're not going to pull me out.

34:56.662 --> 34:58.428
You're right.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.263
You give me the account number,
I shoot you in the head,

35:00.265 --> 35:02.766
don't let you get
eaten alive, huh?

35:02.768 --> 35:04.701
(panting, gasps)

35:04.703 --> 35:06.536
(men laughing)

35:06.538 --> 35:07.771
<i> Listo!</i>

35:07.773 --> 35:10.307
Wow, it's going to go fast now.

35:10.309 --> 35:11.475
I can't remember
if I'm supposed to punch them

35:11.477 --> 35:12.876
in the nose or in the gills.

35:16.615 --> 35:18.165
(gasps)

35:18.166 --> 35:19.716
(man laughs, speaking Spanish)

35:21.453 --> 35:23.487
(muffled grunting)

35:34.466 --> 35:36.433
(man speaks Spanish)

35:41.273 --> 35:43.273
(gunshot, man grunts)

35:45.310 --> 35:46.476
(grunts)

35:46.478 --> 35:47.577
Federal agents!
Down on the deck!

35:47.579 --> 35:49.579
Drop the weapon!

35:57.856 --> 35:59.523
(panting)

35:59.525 --> 36:01.558
You see those sharks?

36:01.560 --> 36:03.493
Just babies-- couldn't
even take a finger.

36:03.495 --> 36:06.730
You should've seen the size
of the ones I scared off.

36:11.570 --> 36:13.637
Thanks, guys.
Mm-hmm.

36:15.774 --> 36:17.741
We got 'em.

36:18.710 --> 36:20.577
It's over.

36:20.579 --> 36:22.546
Uh, what about Townsend?

36:22.548 --> 36:25.182
Turned over to the FBI.

36:25.184 --> 36:26.583
I spoke to NSA.

36:26.585 --> 36:29.753
They want to debrief you,
get you back on the job.

36:30.722 --> 36:32.389
Thank you.

36:32.391 --> 36:34.391
Let's get you out of here.

36:35.360 --> 36:36.593
DANTE:
Hey.

36:36.595 --> 36:39.196
What just happened?
Who are you?

36:39.198 --> 36:40.897
All I can tell
you gentlemen

36:40.899 --> 36:43.733
is that Noah here
is not paranoid.

36:43.735 --> 36:45.635
I knew you wasn't crazy.

36:45.637 --> 36:46.736
You know what?

36:46.738 --> 36:48.705
Neither are you guys.

36:48.707 --> 36:50.440
(laughs softly)

36:50.442 --> 36:52.842
Hey, maybe we can all hang out
when I get out of here.

36:52.844 --> 36:54.344
Like, see a movie.

36:54.346 --> 36:56.146
No can do, my friend.

36:56.147 --> 36:57.947
I mean, it would mean
that I'd have to tell
you my true identity,

36:57.950 --> 37:00.283
and then I'd have
to kill you.

37:00.285 --> 37:01.718
(laughs)

37:01.720 --> 37:02.919
(laughs)

37:02.921 --> 37:05.288
Hey, you guys
did a great job.

37:05.290 --> 37:06.690
Thank you.

37:06.692 --> 37:08.325
Thank you.

37:09.528 --> 37:12.295
Oh, there's a, uh...

37:12.297 --> 37:14.631
a new foosball table
on its way tomorrow.

37:14.633 --> 37:15.899
Yes!

37:15.901 --> 37:17.400
That is so cool
of you, man.

37:17.402 --> 37:18.602
Thank you.

37:18.604 --> 37:19.603
Thank you, really.

37:19.605 --> 37:21.671
For everything.

37:21.673 --> 37:25.575
You guys take care
of yourselves.

37:25.577 --> 37:28.511
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

37:28.513 --> 37:30.947
That dude's fun.

37:30.949 --> 37:33.783
DEEKS:
Kens.

37:35.420 --> 37:37.587
Are you okay?
Yeah. Why?

37:37.589 --> 37:38.922
What happened to your leg?

37:40.425 --> 37:42.592
Oh.

37:42.594 --> 37:44.527
Uh...

37:45.497 --> 37:46.796
Must've happened when I fell.

37:46.798 --> 37:48.698
You fell? Doing what?

37:48.700 --> 37:51.001
Trying to stand.
(sighs)

37:51.003 --> 37:52.736
That a girl.

37:52.738 --> 37:55.639
(whistles)

37:55.641 --> 37:57.607
You didn't feel that?

37:57.609 --> 37:59.709
No, because the leg that works
doesn't feel

37:59.711 --> 38:02.646
and the leg that feels
doesn't work.
Right.

38:02.648 --> 38:03.913
That's a pretty nice cut.
You're going to need sutures,

38:03.915 --> 38:05.348
which means we should probably
clean this

38:05.350 --> 38:06.716
before it gets infected, okay?

38:06.718 --> 38:09.886
Or you should've just
left me out there.

38:09.888 --> 38:12.856
Yeah. No, I definitely...
I thought about that.

38:12.858 --> 38:15.325
I wanted to, it's just that,
you know, Hetty would be livid

38:15.327 --> 38:17.494
if I threw away
a perfectly good agent.

38:18.463 --> 38:20.864
I'm not kidding.

38:23.001 --> 38:24.000
Okay.

38:24.002 --> 38:26.336
Listen,

38:26.338 --> 38:28.938
you are going to live
happily ever after.

38:28.940 --> 38:30.907
Okay, and if I would've
left you over there,

38:30.909 --> 38:32.976
you would've died and then
I would be here by myself,

38:32.978 --> 38:35.045
and that just sounds dreadful.

38:37.015 --> 38:38.515
How much of the stuff
that happened

38:38.517 --> 38:40.317
in the coma do you remember?

38:42.721 --> 38:44.421
I don't know.
I real-- I really don't.

38:44.423 --> 38:48.325
I mix memories and drea...
I don't know.

38:48.327 --> 38:51.061
Well, we should probably
do this again.

38:51.063 --> 38:53.363
I've been walking around

38:53.365 --> 38:54.731
with this thing
in my pocket for weeks.

38:54.733 --> 38:55.965
I'm pretty sure
I'm gonna lose it.

38:55.967 --> 38:57.701
So now seems like the...

38:58.937 --> 39:01.037
Oh, no, no, no.

39:01.039 --> 39:02.339
Kensi Marie Blye...
No.

39:02.341 --> 39:04.741
No, no.

39:04.743 --> 39:06.042
Don't do this right now.

39:06.044 --> 39:07.811
Why?
Not like this.

39:07.813 --> 39:08.978
You don't like it?

39:08.980 --> 39:11.514
I love it, it's beautiful.

39:11.516 --> 39:13.483
It's really beautiful.

39:13.485 --> 39:15.051
I envisioned it differently
in my head.

39:15.053 --> 39:16.486
At some point I thought
I was going to ride in

39:16.488 --> 39:18.455
on a big white horse

39:18.457 --> 39:20.123
and I would be shirtless,
'cause that's awesome.
(laughs)

39:20.125 --> 39:23.993
And then just a road
full of rose petals.

39:23.995 --> 39:25.695
Listen, the details
are inconsequential.

39:25.697 --> 39:26.896
What's important is I love you,

39:26.898 --> 39:28.598
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you.

39:29.568 --> 39:31.301
I...

39:31.302 --> 39:33.035
I'm not going to do... I'm not
going to do it like this.

39:33.038 --> 39:34.838
It isn't fair.
I'm not doing it.

39:34.840 --> 39:35.972
Like what?

39:35.974 --> 39:37.791
Like this, Deeks. Like this.

39:37.792 --> 39:39.609
In this thing.
In this stupid thing.
Okay, stop, stop, stop, stop,

39:39.611 --> 39:41.544
stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop. Listen.

39:41.546 --> 39:43.380
You're not going to be
in a wheelchair.

39:43.382 --> 39:45.014
You understand?

39:45.016 --> 39:46.850
And if you were,

39:46.852 --> 39:48.518
it wouldn't matter to me
'cause I want to spend the rest

39:48.520 --> 39:50.587
of my... Stop.

39:50.589 --> 39:53.022
I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

39:53.024 --> 39:55.091
It doesn't matter.
I love you.

39:55.093 --> 39:56.826
It matters to me.

39:56.828 --> 39:58.695
I am not doing
this to you.

39:58.697 --> 40:00.130
It is not fair.

40:00.132 --> 40:02.766
Take me back to my room.

40:02.768 --> 40:03.967
(sniffles)

40:03.969 --> 40:05.502
Take me back.

40:05.504 --> 40:07.103
Okay. All right.

40:08.907 --> 40:11.040
You want to hang onto it? 'Cause
I'm probably going to lose it.

40:11.042 --> 40:13.710
Deeks, take me back.

40:13.712 --> 40:15.645
Okay.

40:16.615 --> 40:18.548
All right.

40:18.550 --> 40:20.016
Don't smile.

40:20.018 --> 40:21.951
Don't you dare smile.

40:21.953 --> 40:24.053
I love you.

40:25.023 --> 40:27.791
One, two, three.

40:27.793 --> 40:29.459
Swing that leg.

40:29.461 --> 40:30.794
There you go.

40:31.763 --> 40:33.029
I got you.

40:33.031 --> 40:34.664
And one, two, three, up.

40:34.666 --> 40:36.699
Okay, baby girl.

40:36.701 --> 40:39.102
(sighs)

40:39.104 --> 40:41.004
Okay.

40:41.006 --> 40:43.072
You all right?

40:43.074 --> 40:44.941
These can't be
comfortable.

40:44.943 --> 40:47.076
Let's get those off.

40:51.817 --> 40:53.883
All right.

40:53.885 --> 40:57.654
I'll get a, uh, nurse
to take a look at that cut

40:57.656 --> 41:00.890
and... we'll clean it up.

41:14.673 --> 41:16.806
HETTY:
Owen?

41:16.808 --> 41:19.042
Care to join me?

41:20.812 --> 41:22.779
Thanks.

41:22.781 --> 41:24.013
Sit.

41:24.015 --> 41:25.248
Don't mind if I do.

41:28.153 --> 41:30.153
You know, you may be able
to fool the kids

41:30.155 --> 41:32.956
with this "cold" business
of yours...

41:33.925 --> 41:36.693
...but I know you,

41:36.695 --> 41:39.262
and you look and sound worse

41:39.264 --> 41:42.565
than when we pulled you
out of Laos.

41:45.070 --> 41:49.005
Doctors...

41:49.007 --> 41:51.774
They're like lawyers
with knives.

41:51.776 --> 41:55.578
They're still trying
to figure this out.

41:55.580 --> 41:57.881
But it's probably just
a lifetime of bad decisions--

41:57.883 --> 41:59.249
smoking, drinking.

41:59.251 --> 42:01.084
My time in
the triangle.

42:01.086 --> 42:02.619
Agent Orange?

42:04.222 --> 42:07.524
Owen, I'm so sorry.

42:08.660 --> 42:11.227
Listen, nobody gets
out of here alive.

42:11.229 --> 42:14.230
We both know that.

42:15.200 --> 42:18.201
And we should be grateful
we made it this long.

42:19.170 --> 42:20.236
Ain't that the truth.
