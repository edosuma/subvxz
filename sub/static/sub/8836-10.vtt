33:23.294 --> 33:25.421
[WHIMPERING]

33:31.177 --> 33:32.387
[RUFF]

33:52.949 --> 33:55.159
[YAWNS]

33:55.326 --> 33:57.453
OHH. THIS BED IS
GONNA FEEL GOOD.

33:57.620 --> 34:00.790
I AM SO TIRED
TONIGHT.

34:00.957 --> 34:03.459
DID YOU NOTICE
LAURA THIS EVENING?

34:03.626 --> 34:06.379
MM-HMM. I HAD TO TAP
HER ON THE HEAD TWICE
DURING SUPPER

34:06.546 --> 34:08.548
JUST TO WAKE HER UP.

34:08.715 --> 34:11.509
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOTTEN
INTO THAT CHILD LATELY.

34:11.676 --> 34:14.137
WELL, MAYBE JUST
A LITTLE TOUCH
OF SPRING FEVER.

34:14.303 --> 34:15.805
IN AUGUST?

34:15.972 --> 34:18.641
WHATEVER IT IS,
SHE'LL GET OVER IT.

34:18.808 --> 34:20.101
I'M SURE.

34:20.268 --> 34:21.936
HEY. AT LEAST
IT'S NOT AFFECTING
HER SCHOOLWORK.

34:22.103 --> 34:23.688
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN
THE PROBLEM SHE WAS
WORKING ON TONIGHT.

34:23.855 --> 34:26.232
IT WAS MULTIPLICATION
IN THE THOUSANDS.

34:26.399 --> 34:27.859
I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT
CHILD SO EXCITED

34:28.025 --> 34:29.569
ABOUT GETTING AN ANSWER.

34:29.736 --> 34:32.321
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
GOTTEN INTO HER.

34:32.488 --> 34:35.700
WELL, SHE JUST TAKES
AFTER HER MOM--
VERY SMART.

34:35.867 --> 34:37.243
GOOD NIGHT.

34:37.410 --> 34:38.745
GOOD NIGHT.

34:42.832 --> 34:45.460
YOU'RE SURE IN A HURRY
TO GET YOUR CHORES
DONE, HALF-PINT.

34:45.626 --> 34:47.378
PROMISED JONAH
I'D GO FISHING.

34:47.545 --> 34:49.422
YOU AND JONAH HAVE
BEEN DOING A LOT
OF FISHING LATELY,

34:49.589 --> 34:51.507
BUT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
CATCHING ANYTHING.

34:51.674 --> 34:52.884
JUST UNLUCKY,
I GUESS.

34:53.050 --> 34:57.013
PA, IS IT RIGHT,
IF A PERSON
IS DOING SOMETHING

34:57.180 --> 34:59.390
FOR THE GOOD
OF HER FAMILY,

34:59.557 --> 35:03.019
IF SHE DOESN'T
COME RIGHT OUT
AND SAY WHAT IT IS?

35:03.186 --> 35:04.604
YOU MEAN
LIKE A SURPRISE?

35:04.771 --> 35:06.063
YEAH.

35:06.230 --> 35:09.567
YOU AND I WOULDN'T
KNOW WHO THIS PERSON
IS, WOULD WE?

35:09.734 --> 35:11.360
NO FAIR ASKING.

35:11.527 --> 35:13.780
ALL RIGHT. I WON'T ASK.

35:13.946 --> 35:17.700
I IMAGINE IT'S ALL RIGHT,
LONG AS THIS PERSON ISN'T
DOING ANYTHING WRONG.

35:17.867 --> 35:20.912
OH, THIS PERSON ISN'T
DOING ANYTHING WRONG.

35:21.078 --> 35:24.874
IT'S KIND OF LIKE
HUNTING FOR BURIED
TREASURE.

35:25.041 --> 35:27.919
I DON'T THINK THERE'S
ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT.

35:28.085 --> 35:31.255
I MUST SAY, I DO THINK
IT'S A WASTE OF TIME.

35:31.422 --> 35:34.175
I SUPPOSE.

37:31.918 --> 37:33.544
Charles: WHAT
DO YOU THINK OF IT?

37:33.711 --> 37:35.963
HALF-PINT?

37:36.130 --> 37:38.174
YOU WERE
A MILLION MILES AWAY.

37:38.341 --> 37:40.426
I WAS JUST ASKING YOU,
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THE SIGN?

37:40.593 --> 37:43.888
OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

37:44.055 --> 37:45.014
GOT TO GO.

37:45.181 --> 37:48.184
HOPE YOU FIND
SOME BURIED TREASURE.

38:01.739 --> 38:02.907
OW'.

38:03.074 --> 38:05.159
UHH'.

38:18.589 --> 38:20.675
DO YOU REALIZE
HOW MUCH WE HAVE HERE?

38:20.841 --> 38:24.095
ALL'S I KNOW, IT'S
MORE THAN I CAN FIGURE.

38:24.261 --> 38:26.138
I DON'T THINK
IT'S SAFE HERE ANYMORE.

38:26.305 --> 38:28.182
NEITHER DO I.
WHAT'LL WE DO?

38:28.349 --> 38:31.102
GUESS WE'RE JUST GOING
TO HAVE TO TAKE IT
TO THE BANK.

38:31.268 --> 38:33.604
THEN MR. SPRAGUE
WILL KNOW.
EVERYONE WILL KNOW.

38:33.771 --> 38:35.064
THEY WON'T KNOW
WHERE WE GOT IT.

38:35.231 --> 38:36.565
WHEN WE GIVE IT
TO MR. SPRAGUE,

38:36.732 --> 38:38.526
WE'LL ASK HIM
TO PAY US WITH MONEY.

38:38.693 --> 38:40.945
IF HE DOESN'T HAVE
ENOUGH MONEY IN THE BANK,

38:41.112 --> 38:43.364
THEN WE'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE
TO TRUST HIM FOR THE REST.

38:43.531 --> 38:46.283
YOU THINK HE WON'T
HAVE ENOUGH MONEY
IN THE WHOLE BANK?

38:46.450 --> 38:47.785
I DOUBT IT.

38:47.952 --> 38:49.203
WOW'.

38:49.370 --> 38:53.124
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
TRY NOT TO LEAVE ANY TRACES.

38:53.290 --> 38:55.626
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
TAKE THAT SCREEN BACK.

38:55.793 --> 38:59.005
I'LL PUT IT BACK
WHERE I...
FOUND IT, TONIGHT.

38:59.171 --> 39:02.717
GOOD. SO TOMORROW MORNING,
MEET ME HERE, AND YOU
BRING YOUR CART.

39:02.883 --> 39:04.635
TOMORROW'S SCHOOL DAY.

39:04.802 --> 39:07.722
I KNOW THAT.
THAT WAY NOBODY
CAN FOLLOW US HERE.

39:07.888 --> 39:09.306
THEY'LL ALL BE IN SCHOOL.

39:09.473 --> 39:11.308
YOU MEAN PLAY HOOKY?

39:11.475 --> 39:14.270
NO. IT'S NOT LIKE
PLAYING HOOKY.

39:14.437 --> 39:16.772
IT'S MORE LIKE...

39:16.939 --> 39:19.191
A BUSINESS APPOINTMENT.

39:21.318 --> 39:24.321
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
WE'RE RICH'.

39:24.488 --> 39:26.073
YEAH. COME ON'.

39:27.450 --> 39:28.784
WE'RE RICH'.

39:28.951 --> 39:30.828
WE'RE RICH'. YAY'.

39:30.995 --> 39:32.580
WE'RE RICH'.

39:33.497 --> 39:34.582
YAY'.

39:49.555 --> 39:51.432
OH'. I FORGOT SOMETHING.
I GOT TO GO BACK.

39:51.599 --> 39:53.059
BUT YOU'LL BE LATE
FOR SCHOOL.

39:53.225 --> 39:55.019
CAN'T HELP IT.
YOU GO AHEAD.
I'LL TRY AND CATCH UP.

39:55.186 --> 39:56.812
ALL RIGHT.

40:22.088 --> 40:23.798
GET AWAY FROM THE CANDY.

40:23.964 --> 40:25.466
MA SAID WE COULD.

40:25.633 --> 40:27.384
THAT'S IT.
WHEN YOU GET HOME
FROM SCHOOL TODAY,

40:27.551 --> 40:29.970
THAT CANDY IS
GOING TO BE GONE'.

40:30.137 --> 40:31.931
YOU TELL MA THAT.

40:38.145 --> 40:39.480
Harriet: AHH'.

40:39.647 --> 40:40.981
HAVE A NICE DAY.

40:41.148 --> 40:42.775
HAVE A NICE DAY.

40:45.694 --> 40:46.529
[LOUD RIP]

40:46.695 --> 40:47.988
Nellie: AAH'.

40:48.155 --> 40:50.282
SCREEN'S BACK.

41:17.518 --> 41:20.729
WAIT HERE WHILE
I GET MR. SPRAGUE.

41:24.483 --> 41:27.444
DON'T TALK TO ANYBODY
AND KEEP AN EYE OUT.

41:27.611 --> 41:28.988
FOR WHAT?

41:29.155 --> 41:29.905
ROBBERS.

41:30.072 --> 41:32.908
WELL, YOU BETTER
HURRY UP.

41:41.625 --> 41:43.502
IT'S IN THOSE SACKS'.

41:43.669 --> 41:44.962
THOSE?

41:45.129 --> 41:47.798
YOU GOT TO PROMISE
NOT TO TELL ANYBODY
ABOUT ANYTHING.

41:47.965 --> 41:50.968
OTHERWISE, IT WILL BE
SUTTER'S MILL
ALL OVER AGAIN.

41:51.135 --> 41:52.386
DO YOU PROMISE?

41:52.553 --> 41:54.388
OF COURSE
I PROMISE,
YOUNG LADY.

41:54.555 --> 41:55.973
LET'S HAVE A LOOK
AT IT FIRST.

41:56.140 --> 41:57.766
SHOW HIM, JONAH.

42:00.477 --> 42:02.897
IF YOU DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH MONEY IN THE BANK,

42:03.063 --> 42:06.734
WE'LL TRUST YOU
FOR THE REST.

42:06.901 --> 42:10.946
YOU, UH, MUST HAVE
WORKED A LONG TIME
DIGGING THIS ALL UP.

42:11.113 --> 42:12.323
PRETTY NEAR TWO WEEKS.

42:12.489 --> 42:14.867
AND YOU STAYED OUT OF SCHOOL
TODAY TO BRING IT HERE?

42:15.034 --> 42:17.703
OF COURSE WE DID. YOU'RE
NOT OPEN ON SATURDAYS.

42:17.870 --> 42:20.789
DON'T YOU THINK WE
BETTER TAKE THIS STUFF
IN SO YOU CAN WEIGH IT?

42:20.956 --> 42:23.626
I DON'T THINK THAT'S
GOING TO BE NECESSARY.

42:23.792 --> 42:27.922
YOU WORKED MIGHTY HARD, AND YOU
DESERVE BETTER THAN THIS,

42:28.088 --> 42:29.798
BUT YOU HAVE ONE CONSOLATION:

42:29.965 --> 42:31.884
THERE'S A LOT OF GROWNUPS
MADE THE SAME MISTAKE.

42:32.051 --> 42:33.385
WHAT MISTAKE?

42:33.552 --> 42:35.429
I'M AFRAID THIS ISN'T GOLD.

42:35.596 --> 42:37.973
IT'S, UH...IRON PYRITE.

42:38.140 --> 42:39.308
WHAT'S THAT?

42:39.475 --> 42:43.854
WELL, UH...SOME PEOPLE
CALL IT FOOL'S GOLD.

42:44.021 --> 42:47.399
I GUESS THE WORST KIND
OF DISAPPOINTMENT

42:47.566 --> 42:49.360
IS THE KIND
YOU WORK SO HARD AT,

42:49.526 --> 42:51.737
AND YOU'RE ALMOST SCARED
TO DREAM OF IT.

42:51.904 --> 42:55.532
IF IT ISN'T GOLD,
IRON'S WORTH
SOMETHING, ISN'T IT?

42:55.699 --> 42:57.451
NOT THIS KIND.

42:58.869 --> 43:03.374
I'M SORRY.
I'M TRULY SORRY.

43:06.585 --> 43:08.671
COME ON, JONAH.
WE BETTER GO.

43:51.171 --> 43:53.632
THAT'S
THE LAST OF IT.

43:53.799 --> 43:57.344
LOOK AT THAT
OLD STUFF SHINE.

43:57.511 --> 44:00.931
WHAT WERE YOU
PLANNING ON DOING
WITH YOUR SHARE, LAURA?

44:01.098 --> 44:03.934
I DON'T EVEN WANT
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

44:04.101 --> 44:06.770
I BET I'LL HAVE
AN AWFUL DREAM TONIGHT.

44:06.937 --> 44:11.942
DOES THIS MEAN
I DON'T GET YOUR
FISHING ROD AND FLOAT?

44:12.109 --> 44:13.986
A PROMISE
IS A PROMISE.

44:14.153 --> 44:15.529
IT'S YOURS.

44:15.696 --> 44:16.947
HONEST?

44:17.114 --> 44:20.034
THANKS'. SEE YOU
TOMORROW'.

45:05.329 --> 45:07.915
Sprague: INGALLS,
YOU GOT A MINUTE?

46:00.551 --> 46:02.052
HI.

46:02.219 --> 46:03.429
HI.

46:05.180 --> 46:07.516
SURE WOULD FOOL
A PERSON, WOULDN'T IT?

46:09.810 --> 46:11.437
MR. SPRAGUE TOLD ME.

46:12.729 --> 46:15.065
I BET HE THINKS
IT'S A BIG JOKE.

46:15.232 --> 46:17.067
JUST THE OPPOSITE,
HALF-PINT.

46:17.234 --> 46:19.695
WELL, I BET
EVERYBODY ELSE DOES.

46:19.862 --> 46:23.240
WE'RE THE ONLY ONES
THAT KNOW ABOUT IT,

46:23.407 --> 46:25.742
AND I DON'T THINK
IT'S VERY FUNNY

46:25.909 --> 46:27.744
WHEN SOMEBODY WORKS
AS HARD AS YOU DID

46:27.911 --> 46:29.705
TRYING TO SURPRISE
THEIR LOVED ONES.

46:31.915 --> 46:34.585
OH, PA'. I WAS GOING
TO GIVE YOU SO MUCH.

46:34.751 --> 46:37.588
I WAS GOING TO BUY
MA ALL SHE WANTED
AT OLESON'S,

46:37.754 --> 46:40.757
AND I WAS GOING TO
BUY YOU A BIG HOUSE
AND EVERYTHING,

46:40.924 --> 46:43.051
AND NOW LOOK AT IT.

46:45.387 --> 46:47.222
HALF-PINT,
YOU LISTEN TO ME.

46:47.389 --> 46:49.224
YOU GIVE US
EVERYTHING WE WANT

46:49.391 --> 46:51.393
EVERY SINGLE DAY
OF OUR LIVES.

46:52.853 --> 46:57.065
YOU GIVE US LOVE,
RESPECT, AND JOY.

46:58.734 --> 47:03.363
THERE ISN'T ENOUGH GOLD
IN THE WHOLE WORLD
TO BUY THOSE THINGS.

47:06.366 --> 47:08.118
KIND OF NICE
DREAMING ABOUT IT.

47:08.285 --> 47:10.537
WELL, SURE IT IS.
THAT'S WHAT DREAMS ARE FOR.

47:10.704 --> 47:13.332
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
BUT I'M GETTING
KIND OF AN APPETITE.

47:13.499 --> 47:14.958
ME, TOO.

47:15.125 --> 47:16.585
COME ON.

47:25.469 --> 47:27.262
YOU KNOW, PA,

47:27.429 --> 47:30.140
IT'S A PRETTY GOOD THING
I DIDN'T BUY THAT HOUSE
FOR YOU ANYHOW.

47:30.307 --> 47:33.727
MA WOULD HAVE AN AWFUL TIME
CLEANING ALL THOSE ROOMS.

47:33.894 --> 47:36.188
HA HA'. YOU'RE RIGHT,
HALF-PINT.

47:36.355 --> 47:38.565
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY
RIGHT.
