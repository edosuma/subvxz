(General chatter)

01:34.160 --> 01:37.630
- Done your revision?
- Oh, yes.

01:39.720 --> 01:42.359
I've concentrated on trigonometry.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.476
I've done calculus mainly.

01:48.720 --> 01:53.430
I believe they concentrated
on calculus last year.

09:27.160 --> 09:29.594
please put them in the white box.

09:48.680 --> 09:50.636
Stop writing, please.

09:53.640 --> 09:55.596
I said stop writing.

09:57.600 --> 09:59.477
