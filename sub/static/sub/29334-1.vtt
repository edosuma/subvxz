00:52.887 --> 00:55.721
You list music as an interest.

00:56.657 --> 00:59.658
But I don't see no performances.

01:00.094 --> 01:03.996
Choir, orchestra, marching band.

01:03.998 --> 01:07.900
Well, I'm more of a soloist.
Beat of my own drummer, you know?

01:13.908 --> 01:15.574
I'm not a drummer.

01:16.210 --> 01:20.813
I'll just...
put those back for you.

01:25.519 --> 01:27.453
Or a team player, it seems.

01:28.556 --> 01:30.255
That's what my dad says.

01:32.526 --> 01:35.594
Yeah? At least your father
sounds like a smart man.

01:37.364 --> 01:39.364
My father's a dick, sir.

01:39.366 --> 01:42.835
Between work and his unrivaled
enthusiasm for Monday Night Football,

01:43.571 --> 01:45.437
he has no idea what my deal is.

01:48.943 --> 01:50.742
Sorry to bother you.

01:50.744 --> 01:54.813
But Mom said that your
self-indulgent practice interview

01:54.815 --> 01:56.982
can wait until
after dinner. Okay?

01:58.385 --> 02:00.285
Are you going
to take this seriously?

02:00.287 --> 02:03.055
I pulled a lot of strings
to get you this job interview.

02:03.057 --> 02:05.591
Do you know what I was doing
the summer after high school?

02:05.593 --> 02:07.493
- Drugs?
- That's not funny.

02:07.495 --> 02:11.997
Hey everyone, I, uh... I have
a lot more in the car, so...

02:11.999 --> 02:13.065
Just a sec, hon.

02:13.067 --> 02:17.102
I was working 12-hour shifts
in your grandfather's factory.

02:17.104 --> 02:18.837
- And do you know why?
- Because he forced you?

02:18.839 --> 02:20.506
He was preparing me
for the future.

02:20.508 --> 02:22.741
He knew one day I'd take over.

02:22.743 --> 02:26.411
Well, I'm sorry I don't have your unbridled
passion for the ketchup industry, Dad.

02:26.413 --> 02:28.647
It's like, I don't want to live in
the same town I grew up in forever.

02:28.649 --> 02:29.915
None of us want that.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.350
Will you shut up, Lib?

02:31.352 --> 02:34.319
Guys? I really could use a hand.

02:34.321 --> 02:35.754
Yeah, just a second.

02:37.525 --> 02:39.625
I don't think a summer job
is too much to ask.

02:39.627 --> 02:43.529
You know, Ritchie's daughter, Kelly,
waits tables to help pay for college

02:43.531 --> 02:44.963
and she's still
graduating early.

02:44.965 --> 02:46.698
And with the help
of her brother, Eddie,

02:46.700 --> 02:48.934
they cured cancer
and got the Huns out of China.

02:48.936 --> 02:50.435
Eddie's only a sophomore.

02:50.437 --> 02:53.639
He's already on path to get
a full football scholarship.

02:53.641 --> 02:57.376
Wow, sounds like
your ideal son, Dad.

02:57.378 --> 03:01.847
I'm not trying to make
you feel bad. Only motivate you.

03:04.985 --> 03:06.185
I got to get this.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.187
Why is she in a bad mood?

03:08.189 --> 03:09.855
I'm coming!

03:10.291 --> 03:12.157
Mom, why not?

03:12.159 --> 03:14.459
Because I know the kinds of things
that happen on spring break.

03:14.461 --> 03:17.296
What? Kids of overprotective parents
get to reclaim a moment of sanity?

03:17.298 --> 03:19.298
Minors get high and smoke weed.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.200
Well, that's not why I'm going.

03:21.202 --> 03:25.404
Mom, look. Here. See? Culture.

03:26.507 --> 03:28.207
The Starling festival?

03:28.209 --> 03:30.809
Yeah, it's supposed
to be amazing and educational.

03:30.811 --> 03:33.178
- So, it's good.
- Mm-hmm.

03:33.180 --> 03:34.680
Did you ask your father?

03:34.682 --> 03:35.847
He never says yes to anything!

03:35.849 --> 03:37.149
I agree with your mother.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.318
You don't even know
what we're talking about.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.053
This looks amazing, Laura!

03:41.388 --> 03:42.654
Thank you.

03:42.656 --> 03:44.556
- Where's Lib?
- Hunger strike.

03:44.825 --> 03:45.824
Again?

03:45.826 --> 03:47.859
More of Grandma Ruth's pie
for you.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.428
Ooh!

03:50.831 --> 03:52.164
You have our full support.

03:53.534 --> 03:57.269
So, it looks like I have to leave
first thing in the morning for Japan.

03:57.271 --> 03:58.837
Feeling that
three-day itch, huh?

03:58.839 --> 04:01.506
Could you send someone
else this time?

04:01.508 --> 04:02.908
Because the kids
have spring break.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.177
And it would be great
if the whole family could...

04:05.179 --> 04:09.181
Do you think I enjoy being
out of town for weeks on end?

04:09.183 --> 04:13.085
You know, living out of suitcases?
Eating nothing but room service?

04:13.087 --> 04:14.853
I would!

04:16.357 --> 04:18.190
She gets that from
your side of the family.

04:18.192 --> 04:21.560
Okay, well, if Philip wants
to go to the Starling Festival,

04:21.562 --> 04:24.229
then I could take both
of the kids to the lake.

04:24.231 --> 04:25.597
- No!
- No!

04:28.569 --> 04:31.270
Philip has his summer
job interview on Monday.

04:31.272 --> 04:34.573
And, uh... I put in a lot
of effort to make that happen.

04:34.575 --> 04:38.043
How much effort does it take to
hire your son when you're the boss?

04:38.045 --> 04:39.878
You wouldn't understand
the politics, Laura.

04:41.548 --> 04:43.582
- Right.
- No, it's fine, Mom.

04:43.584 --> 04:46.551
I mean, a family vacation is not exactly
what I had in mind for spring break anyhow.

04:46.553 --> 04:49.454
But a bird migration
festival is?

04:50.724 --> 04:53.025
All right. This is BS.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.594
- Philip...
- Where do you think you're going?

04:55.596 --> 04:57.596
To Lewis'. To study.

04:57.598 --> 05:01.233
- That better be reflected in your grades.
- Frank. Frank, let him go.

05:01.235 --> 05:02.801
I hope you're home by 10:00.

05:04.605 --> 05:06.905
Do you remember
when we went to this?

05:06.907 --> 05:07.907
Hmm. No.

06:10.637 --> 06:11.870
Beer me.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.340
Did you speak to your parents?

06:15.342 --> 06:17.142
Did you sell them on the whole

06:17.144 --> 06:19.878
"culture," "science," "festival of
bird migrations" trip for break?

06:19.880 --> 06:22.481
I'm pretty sure they saw it as a
ploy to smoke weed and score girls.

06:22.483 --> 06:23.815
What? Dude, come on.

06:23.817 --> 06:25.550
- It was a terrible idea.
- It was a great idea.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.486
- For who?
- My parents bought it.

06:27.488 --> 06:28.820
Yeah, well, your parents
are idiots, man.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.856
Look, this is
our senior year, dude.

06:30.858 --> 06:33.158
This is our last
spring break ever.

06:33.160 --> 06:36.094
Our final chance to act like the
popular kids we pretend to hate!

06:36.096 --> 06:38.130
You have to inhale.
All the way...

06:38.932 --> 06:40.332
My final chance
to get with Allison.

06:41.535 --> 06:44.836
I hate to break it to you, but you've
never had a chance with Allison.

06:45.539 --> 06:48.940
Shit man, I even got my uncle
to let us crash at his place!

06:48.942 --> 06:50.909
- Is it by the lake?
- It's close enough.

06:51.512 --> 06:53.412
Come on, man. How old are you?

06:55.449 --> 06:57.916
I'm almost 18. I...

06:59.219 --> 07:01.319
Yeah, you know what?
You're right. Okay, I...

07:02.089 --> 07:04.923
I'm tired of my dad telling me
what I can and can't do.

07:04.925 --> 07:07.025
- He's going to Japan, right?
- Mm-hmm.

07:07.027 --> 07:10.862
And then my mom is going to that PETA
demonstration with Lib in the morning.

07:11.565 --> 07:14.733
If we leave before they get
back, we'll be fine.

07:14.735 --> 07:17.202
Hell yeah! Shit.

07:17.204 --> 07:18.970
- We are men. We can do...
- That's right.

07:18.972 --> 07:21.039
There's Sam. Let's go say hi.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.207
Hey Allison!

07:24.211 --> 07:26.611
Don't think she heard me.

07:26.613 --> 07:28.079
You weren't very loud.

07:28.081 --> 07:30.215
- Should I be louder?
- No.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.002
It's way after 10:00.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.737
Can you just ground me
in the morning?

07:52.739 --> 07:54.773
- Did you...
- No, no. Dad, I wasn't drinking.

07:54.775 --> 07:57.509
Did you apply to NYU?

07:57.511 --> 08:00.912
I'm assuming that's one of those
we-regret-to-inform-you letters.

08:00.914 --> 08:03.515
I mean, I... I thought
it'd be a waste of time.

08:03.517 --> 08:04.683
Well...

08:06.253 --> 08:07.253
You got in.

08:14.328 --> 08:16.361
"Dear Philip,
we are pleased to inform you..."

08:16.363 --> 08:19.164
I... I got in.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.298
Holy shit!

08:20.300 --> 08:21.933
I thought you wanted
to go to State.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.635
You want me to go to State.

08:23.637 --> 08:26.771
I wanted to get as far away
from here as possible. That...

08:26.773 --> 08:28.440
I should call Lewis.

08:28.442 --> 08:29.139
Philip.

08:29.151 --> 08:31.276
You're right, it's late.
I should pack, or...

08:31.278 --> 08:32.844
- Philip...
- No, no, wait, wait.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.846
Why would I pack
four months in advance?

08:34.847 --> 08:36.448
That's... Everything
would get wrinkled.

08:36.450 --> 08:38.250
Philip. You can't go.

08:39.686 --> 08:40.655
What do you mean?

08:40.667 --> 08:43.455
Philip, you're not ready
for New York City at all.

08:43.457 --> 08:45.457
Dad, I can't be a musician here.

08:45.459 --> 08:50.862
A musician? Nobody goes to
college to be a musician.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.831
It's not happening. I'm sorry.

08:55.002 --> 08:56.401
No, you're not.

08:56.402 --> 08:57.801
You're thrilled to have another
thing to take away from me.

08:57.804 --> 09:02.040
No NYU, no girlfriend,
you won't even let me have a dog!

09:02.042 --> 09:03.942
Since when did you have
a girlfriend?

09:05.579 --> 09:07.178
I'm almost 18, all right?

09:07.180 --> 09:09.648
You need to stop treating me
like the 5-year-old

09:09.650 --> 09:13.051
who puked on Allison Schumer
at the piano recital.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.142
From what I see,
you're still acting like that kid.

09:15.154 --> 09:16.154
How do you know?

09:16.490 --> 09:18.156
You're never here!

09:32.406 --> 09:33.838
Can I come in?

09:34.942 --> 09:36.508
Legally, I can't stop you.

09:36.510 --> 09:37.842
He'll never let you go.

09:37.844 --> 09:39.578
Maybe I don't need
his permission.

09:39.580 --> 09:42.080
But you need his money.
Tuition isn't cheap.

09:44.518 --> 09:46.017
And you can forget scholarships.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.786
Because you don't exactly
look good on paper.

09:49.289 --> 09:50.956
Okay, aren't you too young
to be hating men?

09:50.958 --> 09:52.891
Look at my role models.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.889
You ready to ditch
this ghost town?

10:24.891 --> 10:26.491
Ah, you have no idea.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.570
If you play that thing
when people are around,

10:38.572 --> 10:40.071
you might actually get laid
once in a while.

10:40.073 --> 10:42.507
Uh, I get laid
all the time, so...

10:42.509 --> 10:44.669
It doesn't count if you're
the only person in the room.

10:46.113 --> 10:48.947
Check it out. Must be getting close.
It's your dad's first baby.

10:48.949 --> 10:51.149
Yeah, the one
he actually spends time with.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.781
But think about all the
parties we could throw there.

10:52.793 --> 10:53.585
Think anyone would come?

10:53.587 --> 10:56.454
All of the ladies
we are gonna hit this weekend!

11:04.665 --> 11:05.830
Yeah!

11:06.933 --> 11:08.366
Spring break!

11:08.368 --> 11:12.604
- Whoa! Yeah.
- Oh, yeah!

11:16.543 --> 11:18.176
Hey, they seem nice.

11:26.687 --> 11:28.019
Is this it?

11:29.189 --> 11:31.056
So much for bachelor paradise.

11:34.327 --> 11:35.694
I think it's nicer
on the inside.

11:35.696 --> 11:37.362
Thank God I got my tetanus shot.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.366
Uncle Ross?

11:45.906 --> 11:47.972
Hello? Uncle... Ross?

11:50.143 --> 11:52.310
Ugh. What time is it?

11:53.180 --> 11:54.212
Daytime.

11:54.648 --> 11:55.914
Again?

12:00.754 --> 12:03.221
Oh... fuck.

12:04.725 --> 12:05.957
Fuck.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.293
Fuck!

12:12.165 --> 12:14.232
This is my friend... Philip.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.500
Yeah. Hi.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.073
I thought
you were bringing a girl.

12:24.044 --> 12:25.510
Not a fucking dude.

12:27.781 --> 12:31.883
Is this your uncle who got fired for being
a pediatrician that crossed the line?

12:31.885 --> 12:34.519
- Nope, that one just got out of jail.
- Okay.

12:34.521 --> 12:37.355
Well, is there any chance
we could stay with him?

12:39.259 --> 12:41.159
I'm guessing that's a no.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.529
- Okay.
- Well.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.632
Oh. Porno. Great.

12:51.705 --> 12:54.038
He used to have
the dopest place in the city,

12:54.040 --> 12:57.208
but I guess catching your wife bang your
best friend can really screw a guy up.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.110
Eesh. Someone married that guy?

12:59.112 --> 13:00.745
Yeah. There's hope for you yet.

13:00.747 --> 13:02.380
Yeah, I don't need hope.

13:02.382 --> 13:03.681
Do you two know what you want?

13:04.217 --> 13:06.251
Uh, are you on the menu?

13:06.253 --> 13:08.219
Ha. Not too good with
the ladies, are you?

13:08.221 --> 13:11.189
- Figure out what you want.
- My shift ends in five minutes.

13:12.225 --> 13:13.558
That's not an invitation.

13:13.560 --> 13:16.694
Uh, I think it was.

13:18.064 --> 13:20.565
What do you think she meant when she
said I wasn't good with the ladies?

13:20.567 --> 13:22.400
That meant that she was
obviously flirting with me.

13:22.402 --> 13:25.303
Great, now you can finally
forget about Allison.

13:42.956 --> 13:44.255
Holy shit!

13:44.257 --> 13:45.924
Well, this is awkward.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.492
That's my dad.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.994
Hawaiian shirt,
headed straight for us!

13:51.431 --> 13:53.191
How did he find us?
You said he was in Japan.

13:53.366 --> 13:55.033
I thought he was.

13:55.702 --> 13:56.702
Come on.

13:59.439 --> 14:00.572
Your jacket.

14:02.876 --> 14:04.309
Okay, here's your salad.

14:04.311 --> 14:05.877
Can I get you
anything else with that?

14:05.879 --> 14:07.946
- Excuse me.
- Oh, my gosh!

14:07.948 --> 14:09.447
Are you okay? Oh, my God.

14:09.449 --> 14:11.249
I'm sorry,
did that spill on you?

14:33.874 --> 14:35.773
Do you think he saw us?

14:39.312 --> 14:41.246
I don't think it's you
he's looking for.

14:46.887 --> 14:48.353
We... We have to follow them.

14:48.355 --> 14:50.255
- Come on!
- What? No, we don't!

14:52.058 --> 14:53.391
Don't get too close.

14:56.830 --> 15:01.532
You know, they say men your father's age
cheat to make themselves feel younger.

15:01.534 --> 15:04.669
She's our age!
How young is he trying to feel?

15:04.671 --> 15:05.437
I don't know.

15:05.449 --> 15:07.005
Yeah, yeah, hold it.
Pull over right here.

15:07.007 --> 15:08.367
- Here?
- Yeah, yeah, stop.

15:11.177 --> 15:12.410
Turn off the car.

15:16.883 --> 15:20.518
There could be a hundred reasons
why an older man would spend time

15:20.520 --> 15:21.819
with an attractive young girl.

15:22.956 --> 15:24.055
Like?

15:24.057 --> 15:25.256
Like...

15:26.026 --> 15:29.427
wild, crazy, horrifying sex.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.195
I was joking.

15:31.197 --> 15:33.264
Oh, no, Philip!
No, no, bad, bad...

15:33.867 --> 15:35.033
Dude! Dude!

15:35.035 --> 15:39.103
Dude, we need to get out of here.
Seriously, do you want to get caught!

15:43.376 --> 15:45.843
What kind of sick shit's
going on in here?

15:50.116 --> 15:51.282
Come on.

15:52.719 --> 15:53.719
Come on!

16:03.663 --> 16:04.963
What are you doing?

16:04.965 --> 16:06.831
I got to find out somehow.

16:06.833 --> 16:10.368
Dude, dude, I saw my parents having
sex once, and it ruined me for life.

16:22.082 --> 16:23.748
- Hey, honey.
- Hey, Mom.

16:25.118 --> 16:27.218
- How was work?
- It was okay.

16:30.256 --> 16:33.257
Where is she? There's my woman.

16:33.259 --> 16:35.760
My woman, my woman, my...

16:35.762 --> 16:38.196
Hello, my man.
I'm so happy you're home.

16:38.198 --> 16:39.530
I missed...

16:39.532 --> 16:41.766
- Are you more beautiful?
- Hey, Dad!

16:41.768 --> 16:43.267
- What the hell?
- Uh-oh.

16:43.269 --> 16:46.437
Here you go, here you go.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.673
Is this my son or my son?

16:52.679 --> 16:56.814
Oh! It is...
It's so good to be home.

16:56.816 --> 16:58.983
- It's good to have you home.
- Right?

16:58.985 --> 16:59.653
Yeah.

16:59.665 --> 17:01.705
I mean, I love
Japan, but it's just like...

17:04.290 --> 17:06.357
Are you okay?

17:09.996 --> 17:13.765
Philip! Philip, what's going on?

17:14.800 --> 17:17.402
Philip, stop. Stop!
I can't bail you out of jail!

17:18.171 --> 17:20.038
Philip! Stop, stop!

17:20.040 --> 17:21.906
Lewis, he's not just cheating!

17:25.011 --> 17:26.411
He has a second family.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.246
Oh...

17:30.316 --> 17:32.884
Well, if at first
you don't succeed?

17:47.333 --> 17:49.233
Mom, does this red look
bloody to you?

17:49.235 --> 17:50.401
Mm-hmm.

17:51.204 --> 17:52.937
Mom! A little help here.

17:52.939 --> 17:54.705
Oh, sorry. Uh...

17:54.707 --> 17:59.277
Uh, bloody? Yes, it is very bloody.
It's like a crime scene.

18:18.031 --> 18:19.964
You know, this is nice.

18:19.966 --> 18:21.432
- What is?
- This.

18:22.268 --> 18:25.837
Just you and me. It's quiet.

18:26.272 --> 18:27.705
Eerily so.

18:27.707 --> 18:30.608
You know, you are gonna
have to get used to this.

18:30.610 --> 18:34.011
When your brother goes away to
college, it's just gonna be you and me.

18:35.482 --> 18:38.950
And Dad. You, me and Dad.

18:38.952 --> 18:41.619
Yeah. Of course,
that's what I meant.

18:50.964 --> 18:51.964
Hello?

18:53.299 --> 18:54.465
Hello?

18:56.970 --> 18:58.636
<i>Hello, is anybody there?</i>

19:35.341 --> 19:36.674
Oh, fuck.

19:38.144 --> 19:39.377
Fuck.

19:40.446 --> 19:42.413
Morning.

19:45.285 --> 19:47.051
Yeah, I'm not hungry.

19:47.053 --> 19:48.352
Me neither.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.534
All right, you know what, Phil?
I've been thinking.

20:05.038 --> 20:09.373
Maybe this shit with your dad is the best
thing that could've ever happened to you.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.742
- How's that?
- You finally found your dad's Kryptonite!

20:11.744 --> 20:13.644
No more curfews,
no more groundings,

20:13.646 --> 20:15.646
you can get anything
you want from him.

20:15.648 --> 20:17.315
You should ask for a car!

20:17.317 --> 20:19.550
You should ask for a Trans Ams.
Trans Ams are are cool.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.085
Okay, he's not buying me a car.

20:21.087 --> 20:23.087
He's gonna say,
"You're not responsible enough."

20:23.089 --> 20:26.057
Or, "You haven't earned it.
You're not perfect enough."

20:26.059 --> 20:28.092
Sounds like he's the one
who's not perfect.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.562
You know what? You're right.

20:32.232 --> 20:33.331
I am?

20:33.333 --> 20:35.733
I mean, look at the guy!

20:36.269 --> 20:37.835
He's cheating on my mom.

20:39.372 --> 20:40.871
He's lying to
practically everyone!

20:40.873 --> 20:42.840
You know, he's the fuck-up.

20:43.943 --> 20:47.078
I'll bet Ritchie doesn't even
know what a con man he really is!

20:47.080 --> 20:50.014
He's always saying,
"Be more like Ritchie's kids."

20:50.016 --> 20:53.017
Ritchie's daughter
has an after-school job,

20:53.019 --> 20:56.754
"Ritchie's son has
this football scholarship..."

21:02.362 --> 21:03.761
- Oh, my God!
- What?

21:06.432 --> 21:08.099
Those are Ritchie's kids.

21:08.101 --> 21:09.767
- Who's Ritchie?
- His dad's best friend from work.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.602
I've never met him. Nobody has.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.139
Ritchie doesn't exist.

21:18.244 --> 21:21.145
My dad is Ritchie.

21:22.415 --> 21:27.885
So, your whole life you've been compared
to your real brother and sister?

21:29.222 --> 21:30.220
That's messed up.

21:30.232 --> 21:32.890
What do you think he's
telling them about you?

21:39.232 --> 21:40.464
Nothing.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.205
I'll get it!

21:52.979 --> 21:55.880
Uh... You're the kid from the
pool, right?

21:56.783 --> 21:59.183
Is your father home?

21:59.185 --> 22:00.318
Are you stalking me?

22:00.320 --> 22:02.586
No, no, I'm not like that at all

22:02.588 --> 22:06.657
I'm just... Ritchie's son.

22:09.162 --> 22:10.461
Right. You're, uh, Peter.

22:10.463 --> 22:12.663
- Philip.
- That's it. The rock star.

22:13.766 --> 22:16.701
Right, yeah. Ah, so...

22:17.437 --> 22:22.473
Frank said that if I was ever in
town, I should just stop on by.

22:22.475 --> 22:24.942
- You've met my dad?
- We go way back.

22:24.944 --> 22:26.210
Come in.

22:28.815 --> 22:29.847
Dipshit.

22:33.219 --> 22:36.187
I never met Ritchie,
but my dad talks about him all the time.

22:37.023 --> 22:39.623
- Oh, you have a dog.
- That's Elway.

22:39.625 --> 22:41.025
Of course it is.

22:41.661 --> 22:42.860
I'll go get my mom.

22:50.169 --> 22:51.268
They get a dog.

22:57.143 --> 22:59.243
Elway, go. Scram.

23:00.713 --> 23:03.481
Here we are. Try one.

23:03.483 --> 23:05.516
Are those... ears?

23:05.518 --> 23:06.918
Well, don't worry,
they're not real.

23:07.887 --> 23:11.555
The ear is just a metaphor.

23:11.991 --> 23:14.592
Hmm, okay.
Metaphor cookie? Yeah?

23:20.266 --> 23:23.501
Oh! Yeah, that part's
not edible. Sorry.

23:24.337 --> 23:27.605
- What is it?
- Read it. It's a haiku!

23:28.007 --> 23:29.340
Okay. Ah...

23:30.343 --> 23:33.277
"Jacaranda trees.
Tall and reaching. High like me."

23:33.279 --> 23:36.347
So, I'm thinking of
calling them Haiku-kies!

23:36.349 --> 23:37.615
Hmm!

23:39.218 --> 23:41.185
- Do you have any milk?
- Is there too much salt?

23:41.187 --> 23:43.687
- Uh-uh, no.
- Always put too much salt...

23:43.689 --> 23:46.824
Yes, of course, milk.
Coming right up.

23:59.272 --> 24:02.606
Your mom is a really good cook,
isn't she?

24:02.608 --> 24:04.308
She is. Yeah.

24:04.310 --> 24:07.378
From what Frank tells me,
she and I would get along well.

24:07.380 --> 24:09.662
It's just hard to believe
that we still keep

24:09.674 --> 24:11.816
missing each other
after all these years.

24:14.220 --> 24:18.556
Oh! Eddie, come meet Philip,
Ritchie's son.

24:18.558 --> 24:20.057
I thought Ritchie was dead.

24:20.059 --> 24:21.058
Uh...

24:21.060 --> 24:25.062
- Not that...
- No, sweetheart, Ritchie's not dead.

24:28.401 --> 24:29.800
Good cookie.

24:31.471 --> 24:33.737
Oh. Uh...

24:33.739 --> 24:36.640
Why don't you show Philip
your room?

24:36.642 --> 24:38.742
You guys can hang out until
your dad comes home, and then...

24:38.744 --> 24:41.779
- Oh, that... that's...
- And I'll set an extra place for dinner?

24:41.781 --> 24:44.081
You know what, on second
thought, I don't want to impose.

24:44.083 --> 24:46.083
Oh, not at all!
It's pizza night.

24:46.819 --> 24:47.985
Follow me.

24:49.455 --> 24:51.489
So, pizza night, huh?

24:52.024 --> 24:53.991
We do it every other Wednesday.

24:56.929 --> 25:01.398
Ah, you play football.
My dad loves football.

25:01.868 --> 25:03.400
- All these yours?
- Mm-hmm.

25:06.372 --> 25:07.372
Shiny.

25:09.041 --> 25:12.176
Oh, and you fish, too.

25:12.178 --> 25:15.012
My dad and I go fishing
once a month.

25:16.682 --> 25:18.983
You guys must be close.

25:18.985 --> 25:20.610
He's gone a lot for
work, so we try and make

25:20.622 --> 25:22.186
the most of his time at home.
Do you fish?

25:22.188 --> 25:25.122
No. My father's
never taken me fishing.

25:26.125 --> 25:29.226
We're more like boss
and employee than family.

25:29.962 --> 25:34.164
He'd probably fire me if he could.
He gives me quarterly performance reviews.

25:34.166 --> 25:35.799
Hey, me too.

25:35.801 --> 25:38.802
Yeah, but you must get like
extra points 'cause of varsity.

25:38.804 --> 25:40.971
Varsity this year, captain next,

25:40.973 --> 25:43.173
scholarship to a Big Ten
after that.

25:43.175 --> 25:46.043
I don't want to play
professionally, just a free ride.

25:46.045 --> 25:48.312
Plus the other perks.

25:48.314 --> 25:49.413
Girls.

25:49.849 --> 25:52.116
Wow, you've really
thought this out.

25:59.725 --> 26:02.026
Is this a... souvenir?

26:02.028 --> 26:03.327
My dad got that in Japan.

26:03.863 --> 26:05.496
Japan, yeah.

26:06.265 --> 26:07.898
It's funny,
I have the exact same one.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.733
No way.

26:10.336 --> 26:12.736
Way. Totally.

26:13.506 --> 26:15.172
Pizza's here!

26:16.842 --> 26:18.309
Sorry it took so long.

26:18.878 --> 26:21.712
It was packed.
I don't know what that's about.

26:21.714 --> 26:24.582
But you know who
I ran into? Stan Kempler.

26:24.584 --> 26:25.155
Oh!

26:25.167 --> 26:26.917
Yeah, they're going
up to the lake tonight.

26:26.919 --> 26:29.386
And I was like, "You know what, I think
we're probably gonna go up tomorrow."

26:29.388 --> 26:33.357
But I didn't want to commit because I don't
want to get trapped into an obligation.

26:33.359 --> 26:36.093
Anyway, guess what
Stan brought up?

26:36.095 --> 26:40.264
Troy made varsity. Like he should've.
I mean, the guy's a junior, right?

26:40.266 --> 26:44.368
The weird thing is, it's like,
I don't mind him bragging about his son.

26:44.370 --> 26:46.937
'Cause, you know,
he loves his son and I love Eddie,

26:46.939 --> 26:49.406
Eddie is a sophomore,
he's already gonna make varsity.

26:49.408 --> 26:52.977
But the way he talks
about Troy seems dishonest.

26:58.250 --> 27:00.918
Oh! I told you
he'd be surprised.

27:00.920 --> 27:02.353
Smooth move, Dad.

27:02.755 --> 27:04.755
- I can explain...
- Frank, it's Philip!

27:04.757 --> 27:08.292
- Yeah, I... You know...
- Ritchie's kid, the guitar guy.

27:08.294 --> 27:11.795
Ritchie's kid?
Philip, the Ritchie's...

27:11.797 --> 27:13.330
Ritchie.

27:13.332 --> 27:17.901
Sweetheart,
sit down and talk to Philip.

27:17.903 --> 27:19.470
He's been waiting to see you.

27:19.472 --> 27:22.139
- I'll get it.
- Are you sure? Be careful, grab a towel.

27:22.141 --> 27:26.410
Philip. Ritchie's son...
Hey, Frank.

27:26.412 --> 27:31.915
Wh-What are you doing down here?
Up here? Why are you here?

27:31.917 --> 27:33.917
Oh, uh, spring break.

27:33.919 --> 27:37.488
You were specifically told you
couldn't go on spring break.

27:37.490 --> 27:41.091
I mean...
that's what Ritchie mentioned.

27:41.093 --> 27:43.160
Yeah, he did.
But he changed his mind.

27:43.929 --> 27:44.584
Is that so?

27:44.596 --> 27:46.597
He's been changing
his mind a lot of lately.

27:46.599 --> 27:49.166
Ever since I caught him
cheating on my mom.

27:50.102 --> 27:53.871
Oh, Philip, I'm so sorry.

27:53.873 --> 27:57.841
Yeah, you know, it's partly the
reason I wanted to come up here.

27:57.843 --> 28:00.277
Frank, talk to you,

28:00.279 --> 28:02.680
given that you're
so close to my dad.

28:02.682 --> 28:04.615
Have you...
Have you told your mother?

28:04.617 --> 28:06.450
Still thinking about it.

28:06.452 --> 28:08.952
Well, there's two sides
to every story.

28:08.954 --> 28:10.287
So it seems.

28:11.691 --> 28:14.458
That sucks. Can we eat now?

28:14.460 --> 28:17.995
- Yeah, yeah.
- Pizza.

28:17.997 --> 28:19.296
Yeah, pizza.

28:19.298 --> 28:21.365
- You... you want pizza?
- Mm-hmm.

28:21.367 --> 28:23.300
I hear you guys eat it
every other Wednesday.

28:23.302 --> 28:25.536
It's thoughtful to give
your family such a treat.

28:41.587 --> 28:42.653
Well, um...

28:42.655 --> 28:47.157
this has been an enlightening
conversation and all, but I'm out.

28:47.159 --> 28:48.659
See you guys sometime tomorrow.

28:48.661 --> 28:49.741
- Have fun, honey.
- Thanks.

28:55.201 --> 28:58.969
You're not going to ask her where
she's going or when she's coming back?

28:59.605 --> 29:00.605
We trust her.

29:01.273 --> 29:03.640
She's earned our trust.

29:08.414 --> 29:11.415
Well, if you'll excuse me.
I think I'm going to be sick.

29:14.220 --> 29:16.086
- He's fine. Maybe I'll...
- Should I...

29:16.088 --> 29:19.022
I'll check on... Make sure
he finds the bathroom.

29:19.024 --> 29:20.324
Yeah, I got it. I'm all right.

29:32.371 --> 29:34.471
- Philip...
- Wow, this place is great.

29:35.474 --> 29:37.508
I see why you love
traveling so much.

29:39.145 --> 29:41.278
I know how you must feel.

29:43.115 --> 29:44.748
I never meant to hurt you.

29:44.750 --> 29:46.383
You never meant to get caught.

29:46.385 --> 29:49.553
You don't know the whole story.
It's complicated.

29:49.555 --> 29:51.155
Seems complicated, yeah.

29:52.091 --> 29:53.791
Except not. I mean,
it makes sense.

29:54.293 --> 29:56.960
Your work schedule.
Your control issues.

29:56.962 --> 29:58.796
Where does your mother
think you are right now?

29:58.798 --> 30:01.832
Oh, it's fine. She thinks I'm at
Lewis' studying. Yeah, I left a note.

30:01.834 --> 30:05.636
It's not a great lie, but I haven't
had your years of experience.

30:06.639 --> 30:10.007
- Are you enjoying this?
- Yes. Yes, I am.

30:11.310 --> 30:13.343
This isn't some game, Philip.

30:13.345 --> 30:16.413
This is everyone's lives
you're playing with.

30:16.415 --> 30:20.217
Well, lucky for you,
you have a spare.

30:20.853 --> 30:24.121
Yeah, I don't expect you
to understand,

30:24.123 --> 30:28.192
but I did this
for you and your sister.

30:29.595 --> 30:30.661
Sisters.

30:33.299 --> 30:34.615
And brother.

30:34.616 --> 30:35.932
It does sound strange
finally hearing it.

30:35.935 --> 30:38.335
You did this for you.

30:38.938 --> 30:41.338
You felt trapped. You got out.

30:42.441 --> 30:43.607
Sounds familiar.

30:45.945 --> 30:47.611
What do you want me
to say, Philip?

30:47.613 --> 30:50.180
You caught me, what now?

30:50.950 --> 30:52.182
What do you want me to do?

30:58.290 --> 30:59.690
Tuition to NYU.

31:00.492 --> 31:02.726
You have your escape.
I want mine.

31:03.863 --> 31:05.462
You're blackmailing me?

31:07.800 --> 31:09.132
You think you can...

31:09.134 --> 31:11.368
- Frank, Frank?
- Yeah, hon?

31:12.371 --> 31:14.037
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:14.039 --> 31:17.507
Ah, I just had a thought.
Why doesn't Philip spend the night?

31:17.509 --> 31:19.843
- Ah...
- Oh, my God, I'd love to.

31:19.845 --> 31:22.346
Great! Oh, good.

31:22.348 --> 31:27.150
Well, just head on up to Eddie's room and
tell him to make up the spare bed for you.

31:27.152 --> 31:29.486
And we'll have a fun sleepover.

31:29.488 --> 31:32.756
Well, I could use some fun.
It's been a while.

31:44.236 --> 31:47.271
Okay, we should call his family.
And let them know that he's here.

31:47.273 --> 31:48.872
Yeah, I... I'll handle it.

31:48.874 --> 31:51.575
Oh, that poor kid. Did you know?

31:52.845 --> 31:54.311
- No.
- Ritchie didn't tell you?

31:55.381 --> 31:58.181
I guess I don't know him
that well.

31:58.183 --> 32:00.617
Well, then this must be hard
for you too.

32:00.619 --> 32:04.688
You would consider him
to be a trusted friend.

32:04.690 --> 32:06.256
I'm so mad at him.

32:06.258 --> 32:09.426
Yeah, I mean, he's gonna get
an earful from me.

32:09.428 --> 32:11.094
But you know what, Bon,

32:11.096 --> 32:12.696
- let me just get some of this stuff.
- Yeah, sure.

32:12.698 --> 32:15.232
- I'll meet you upstairs.
- Okay, okay. All right.

32:15.234 --> 32:17.034
Oh, I'll get your tea.

32:17.036 --> 32:18.268
Yeah, thanks, hon.

32:26.045 --> 32:27.277
Fuck me.

33:00.612 --> 33:03.280
- What are you doing?
- Going for a run. Wanna come?

33:03.282 --> 33:04.781
I'm good, thanks.

33:04.783 --> 33:06.083
You ready, Eddie?

33:06.085 --> 33:08.685
Oh, on second thought,
I'll come.

33:09.154 --> 33:10.320
We're going jogging.

33:10.756 --> 33:12.723
- Yeah.
- Good.

33:13.926 --> 33:15.192
Philip's coming.

33:23.969 --> 33:25.435
What's with you guys?

33:25.437 --> 33:27.404
We'll catch up.
My shoe's untied.

33:31.143 --> 33:32.743
I thought you could use
a breather.

33:33.145 --> 33:36.213
Oh, you lied for me.
How thoughtful.

33:37.282 --> 33:39.149
Are you sure he's your son?

33:39.151 --> 33:42.519
He's in training. Wouldn't kill
you to have a little more regimen.

33:44.023 --> 33:45.222
It might.

33:45.958 --> 33:47.238
You didn't have to come running.

33:47.793 --> 33:50.394
You kidding?
I love watching you sweat.

33:52.131 --> 33:54.264
Wait up, Eddie! Ooh!

34:09.348 --> 34:11.547
Oh, name-brand soda, huh?

34:12.418 --> 34:14.217
My dad always makes us
buy generic.

34:14.219 --> 34:16.887
That sucks. We do it because
my grandfather died at 50.

34:16.889 --> 34:19.456
So, we live it up
while we can. Right, Dad?

34:19.925 --> 34:20.925
Yup.

34:21.726 --> 34:23.326
Oh, wow.

34:23.328 --> 34:24.561
We have so much in common.

34:24.563 --> 34:26.329
My grandfather died at 50.

34:26.331 --> 34:28.665
Always be prepared.

34:34.239 --> 34:36.306
Ah! I call first shower!

34:40.279 --> 34:41.445
Classy.

34:41.447 --> 34:43.380
I hope you're having fun,

34:43.382 --> 34:46.049
because you're jeopardizing
everything with your rookie mistakes!

34:46.051 --> 34:48.251
Saying your
grandfather died at 50

34:48.253 --> 34:52.688
right after Eddie said his grandfather
died at 50 is bush league, man.

34:52.690 --> 34:55.092
Okay, I'm sorry I don't know
all your covert rules.

34:55.094 --> 34:58.361
Only offer
information when asked.

34:58.363 --> 35:02.399
When asked a question,
always answer with a question.

35:02.401 --> 35:05.836
Okay. Here's one.
What's gonna happen when you get caught?

35:06.572 --> 35:08.605
I'm gonna walk into traffic.

35:08.607 --> 35:10.707
And on the off chance I survive,

35:10.709 --> 35:13.944
it's hard to be mad at a man
in a full-body cast.

35:17.282 --> 35:18.715
Are we good? I got to get this.

35:19.818 --> 35:21.351
Yeah, we're good.

35:22.554 --> 35:24.454
Nice to see that
some things are the same.

35:47.579 --> 35:49.646
Of course, you paint.

35:49.648 --> 35:50.648
Oh.

35:51.450 --> 35:55.652
Yes, well, I'm not much good
at anything else.

35:56.688 --> 35:58.488
Somehow I doubt that.

36:09.501 --> 36:10.934
- Ooh!
- Oh, God.

36:12.204 --> 36:13.937
- Sorry.
- It's okay. Are you okay?

36:13.939 --> 36:15.071
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

36:15.674 --> 36:18.208
That's fine.
I do it all the time.

36:18.210 --> 36:19.743
Okay. Sorry.

36:20.812 --> 36:23.780
You must think it's strange
I keep painting the same thing.

36:23.782 --> 36:25.115
No. I...

36:25.117 --> 36:29.186
But actually they're all just
a little bit different. See?

36:29.655 --> 36:30.921
Here's a cute little gnome.

36:31.456 --> 36:34.024
- And then this guy.
- Wow.

36:34.026 --> 36:36.459
No matter how many times
I paint the same landscape,

36:36.461 --> 36:38.495
there's always something
hiding there.

36:38.497 --> 36:41.064
And I get to find it.

36:41.066 --> 36:42.199
Plus, it's a bestseller.

36:42.968 --> 36:45.702
And then there's that.
Thanks, darling.

36:46.972 --> 36:49.539
I'm headed to town to drop
these off. You wanna come with?

36:53.478 --> 36:57.314
You got Grandma Ruth's car!
I thought they sold it at auction.

36:57.316 --> 36:58.448
You knew my grandma?

36:58.984 --> 37:02.085
My dad mentioned her.
I think he met her once.

37:02.087 --> 37:03.887
Must have been back
when she bought it.

37:03.889 --> 37:06.089
'Cause she died
before I was born.

37:10.162 --> 37:11.494
Sorry to hear that.

37:11.496 --> 37:12.963
Are your grandparents
still alive?

37:13.432 --> 37:15.732
Uh, yeah, three of them are.

37:15.734 --> 37:17.601
Do they bake pie and shit?

37:17.603 --> 37:20.203
My dad said his mom baked the
best rhubarb pie in the world.

37:20.205 --> 37:23.740
You know what? I'm really looking
forward to riding in this thing.

37:23.742 --> 37:25.508
Does it get good mileage?

37:25.510 --> 37:29.446
No, it sucks.
Not as bad as your ensemble.

37:30.115 --> 37:32.015
My what?

37:32.017 --> 37:34.784
I get the whole ironic look, but do
you ever think about changing it up?

37:34.786 --> 37:37.187
I mean, at least
changing the shirt.

37:37.189 --> 37:39.155
What... I lost my luggage.

37:40.092 --> 37:41.591
Perfect excuse for a detour.

37:47.432 --> 37:48.765
Here. Try this on.

37:50.269 --> 37:52.636
Don't I need like a goatee
for this or something?

37:52.638 --> 37:55.138
Probably.
But give it a shot anyway.

37:57.376 --> 37:58.508
All right.

37:59.211 --> 38:00.810
What do you think about this?

38:00.812 --> 38:02.212
It's kinda slutty, right?

38:02.214 --> 38:04.314
It... kinda... yeah.

38:04.316 --> 38:08.551
Yeah, it's a bummer about your parents.
I always envied their story.

38:08.553 --> 38:10.253
What story?

38:10.255 --> 38:12.789
Living in the same hometown that
they had their first kiss in,

38:12.791 --> 38:14.891
king and queen of the prom.

38:15.827 --> 38:17.227
It's so old-fashioned and cute.

38:18.130 --> 38:20.130
I should have known
it was too good to be true.

38:22.267 --> 38:23.466
Are you gonna tell your mom?

38:23.935 --> 38:25.902
Wouldn't you want to know
if you were her?

38:27.339 --> 38:28.805
No. Not really.

38:33.845 --> 38:35.078
I like the new Philip.

38:37.449 --> 38:38.682
What do you think of this?

38:45.924 --> 38:46.924
We should go.

38:50.595 --> 38:51.828
Shouldn't take too long.

38:51.830 --> 38:52.830
Cool.

39:02.507 --> 39:05.709
Now I'm actually kind of
regretting that I got this watch

39:05.711 --> 39:08.111
because if I had gotten
the pink one, then it kind of...

39:08.113 --> 39:09.113
Hey, Allison!

39:10.949 --> 39:11.949
Hey.

39:14.519 --> 39:16.019
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:16.021 --> 39:17.954
- Uh...
- Philip.

39:17.956 --> 39:20.890
- Right.
- Or Phil, you know, whatever.

39:20.892 --> 39:22.859
- Is this your car?
- It is.

39:22.861 --> 39:24.361
It was a gift
from my grandmother.

39:24.363 --> 39:25.862
Oh, that's cool.

39:27.165 --> 39:29.926
- What are you guys up to?
- Oh, we're going to the Starling Festival.

39:30.001 --> 39:31.167
Are you going?

39:31.169 --> 39:32.869
Oh, no, I'm super busy.

39:33.305 --> 39:34.305
Doing what?

39:35.540 --> 39:37.807
My band is performing.

39:37.809 --> 39:39.376
That's awesome. Like at a bar?

39:39.378 --> 39:42.178
No, it's like a private event,

39:42.180 --> 39:44.647
but we're like playing
this week, so...

39:44.649 --> 39:45.682
That's really cool.

39:47.586 --> 39:50.120
Well, maybe you can come to the lake
after, when you're done.

39:50.722 --> 39:52.722
I'll try, yeah.

39:54.559 --> 39:56.393
Cool. Hope to see you there.

39:56.395 --> 39:57.894
All right, see you around.

40:00.031 --> 40:01.097
Do you mind?

40:01.099 --> 40:02.899
Oh, um, yeah.

40:03.869 --> 40:05.168
That a friend of yours?

40:06.371 --> 40:07.737
It's complicated.

40:13.845 --> 40:15.278
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Kels.

40:15.680 --> 40:16.913
Philip.

40:24.122 --> 40:26.923
Ugh. Are you trying
to look homeless.

40:27.559 --> 40:28.925
Who are you supposed to be?

40:28.927 --> 40:30.794
Do you really want me to
answer that question.

40:32.531 --> 40:33.463
Where are we going?

40:33.465 --> 40:37.801
To the lake.
And we are not going anywhere.

40:40.038 --> 40:41.038
What's this?

40:41.440 --> 40:42.639
You win.

40:44.376 --> 40:45.942
That's what you wanted, right?

40:46.711 --> 40:48.845
- Yeah.
- So now you can leave.

40:52.050 --> 40:53.950
You know, I thought
you'd be celebrating.

40:55.720 --> 40:56.820
I'm thrilled.

40:56.822 --> 41:00.957
- I'll just call Lewis to come pick me up.
- Hey, hey...

41:02.928 --> 41:04.894
We have an agreement, right?
I mean...

41:05.997 --> 41:10.133
After... After you leave,
my secret stays here, right?

41:16.174 --> 41:19.676
You know, the worst thing
about all of this is that...

41:20.445 --> 41:25.081
I spent so many years of my
life being disappointed in myself.

41:28.520 --> 41:30.720
Really, I just should've been
disappointed in you.

41:39.297 --> 41:40.830
Absolutely not.

41:41.333 --> 41:42.333
Why?

41:43.001 --> 41:45.668
Bon, he's...
He's on spring break.

41:45.670 --> 41:49.172
He's a teenager. He doesn't want
to go to a lake with a family.

41:50.208 --> 41:53.910
Frank, he's not here for spring break.
He's here for you.

41:54.646 --> 41:56.980
You talk about Ritchie's kids
like they were your own.

41:56.982 --> 41:59.916
And right now he could
really use a father like you.

42:02.454 --> 42:05.421
Bon, I'm gonna have to say no.

42:07.025 --> 42:08.025
Okay?

42:24.409 --> 42:26.476
Everybody bring
food to the kitchen.

42:26.478 --> 42:30.280
Wow, I stayed in a place
like this when I was a kid.

42:31.149 --> 42:33.850
There was an outhouse
in the back with a moon on it.

42:33.852 --> 42:35.718
My sister and I thought
it would be funny

42:35.720 --> 42:39.289
if we carved a clover and a
horseshoe in it, like the cereal.

42:39.824 --> 42:41.824
And when we came back,

42:41.826 --> 42:43.226
- someone had carved...
- A diamond.

42:44.195 --> 42:45.228
We carved that.

42:45.897 --> 42:47.230
Is he talking about this place?

42:48.266 --> 42:53.169
He is. Ritchie and I
shared the cabin back then.

42:53.171 --> 42:55.405
We tried to get
the families together

42:55.407 --> 42:58.908
I guess five years in a row,
but it never happened.

42:58.910 --> 43:00.977
Eddie, can you grab my bag?

43:06.184 --> 43:09.452
We came here a few times.
It was nice.

43:10.021 --> 43:12.088
Ritchie always thought
you hated this place.

43:15.694 --> 43:16.793
Well, I didn't.

43:24.803 --> 43:26.970
So what about that girl, Cindy?

43:26.972 --> 43:29.038
Dad, I have lots of girls.

43:29.040 --> 43:31.107
Oh, yeah.
I remember when you didn't

43:31.119 --> 43:32.875
even like bratwurst,
now you love it.

43:32.877 --> 43:36.346
You know why you love
it, 'cause it's the way I cook it.

43:37.882 --> 43:39.782
Hey man, good to see you.

43:39.784 --> 43:41.250
- Yeah, good to see you too.
- Yeah, it's been a long time.

43:41.252 --> 43:42.919
Let's go, you guys.

43:42.921 --> 43:44.761
- You ready to do this?
- Looking very summery.

43:44.990 --> 43:47.090
I have a football,
would you like to lose again?

43:47.092 --> 43:50.226
Why don't you spot me seven, and you
can play your favorite game of catch-up.

43:50.228 --> 43:52.137
So here's what we'll
do, we'll do four downs.

43:52.149 --> 43:52.829
Got it.

43:52.831 --> 43:54.998
- And then you guys will lose.
- You wish, Frank.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.666
Just like we practiced.

43:56.668 --> 43:59.102
- Want a beer?
- What are you doing? Are you crazy?

43:59.104 --> 44:00.903
- What?
- He's right there!

44:00.905 --> 44:03.072
What, my dad?
Don't worry about him.

44:03.074 --> 44:04.774
He says he'd rather we drink
in front of him

44:04.776 --> 44:06.496
than get drunk like
stupid teens at a party.

44:06.745 --> 44:09.278
- Oh, does he now.
- I'm like Boomer Esiason.

44:11.683 --> 44:13.316
All right, well, cheers.

44:15.487 --> 44:16.117
Hike.

44:16.129 --> 44:18.054
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi...

44:20.925 --> 44:23.026
I don't understand.
It's spring break,

44:23.028 --> 44:24.594
your parents let you do
whatever you want.

44:24.596 --> 44:25.728
Shouldn't you be cutting loose?

44:25.730 --> 44:28.431
The whole teen rebellion act is
such a cliche. Don't you think?

44:29.134 --> 44:30.633
Depends on who
you're rebelling from.

44:30.635 --> 44:32.502
That's got to hurt.

44:32.504 --> 44:35.104
Does it hurt
more ego than anything?

44:35.106 --> 44:38.041
I figured I better spend as much
time with my folks as I can now,

44:38.043 --> 44:40.343
since I'm moving
to New York in the fall.

44:40.345 --> 44:41.944
Wait. You are?

44:41.946 --> 44:44.280
Yeah, I got into
New York University.

44:44.282 --> 44:46.849
Your parents are letting you
go to NYU?

44:47.552 --> 44:51.320
Yeah, I got in and they were like,
have fun a thousand miles away.

44:51.322 --> 44:54.157
I'm not complaining,
but they treat me like I'm a stranger.

44:54.159 --> 44:55.892
No, they treat you
like you're an adult.

44:55.894 --> 44:57.660
- Nailed it!
- Okay!

44:57.662 --> 45:00.063
I don't think that was fair.
It was off-sides.

45:00.398 --> 45:01.564
Can you get my back?

45:04.302 --> 45:07.203
Yeah. Yeah, I'd love
to get your back...

45:08.473 --> 45:09.473
Kelly.

45:09.874 --> 45:11.207
I'm open!

45:11.643 --> 45:13.443
Come on, Dad, I'm deep!

45:14.646 --> 45:16.479
- Throw the ball!
- I'm coming to get you.

45:17.482 --> 45:20.249
So,
do you have a girlfriend back home?

45:20.251 --> 45:24.153
Yes. No. I don't know. It's...

45:24.155 --> 45:27.323
You don't know? Sounds like
you take after your dad.

45:27.926 --> 45:29.926
Okay, please don't say that.

45:31.863 --> 45:34.030
I think I know
why you tagged along.

45:34.032 --> 45:35.231
You do?

45:38.169 --> 45:40.403
Oh, my God! Dad!

45:40.405 --> 45:41.471
Sorry.

45:42.373 --> 45:43.473
Trick elbow.

45:46.177 --> 45:47.910
- Thanks.
- Sorry about my dad.

45:48.279 --> 45:49.846
He can be intense sometimes.

45:49.848 --> 45:51.114
You think?

45:55.220 --> 45:57.286
Whose guitar is that?

45:57.288 --> 45:59.555
I think it's my dad's. But I'm not sure.
It's always sat in that corner.

45:59.557 --> 46:02.058
I'm glad you came actually.
Takes his focus off me for once.

46:02.060 --> 46:03.726
I thought you guys always did
this kind of thing.

46:03.728 --> 46:05.695
You know, jogging, football.

46:05.697 --> 46:07.263
Monthly fishing trips.

46:07.265 --> 46:11.400
I love my dad. I like football.
But I hate fishing.

46:11.402 --> 46:13.436
Don't tell him I said that.
He's pretty sensitive.

46:13.438 --> 46:15.104
I wouldn't wanna hurt
his feelings.

46:15.106 --> 46:17.507
I don't think he's
as sensitive as you think.

46:19.310 --> 46:22.578
Anyways, I've been doing what
he wants for so long

46:22.580 --> 46:24.280
I don't even know
what I like anymore.

46:26.718 --> 46:28.401
I only know what I'm good at.

46:28.402 --> 46:30.085
You should stick up for yourself.
Tell him what you don't like.

46:30.088 --> 46:31.788
Then we'd never
do anything together.

46:31.790 --> 46:34.123
Or maybe you'd do the things
that you actually like to do.

46:34.125 --> 46:35.992
Is that how it is with your dad?

46:36.895 --> 46:38.528
Uh, no. Not really.

46:40.465 --> 46:43.332
Troy's got skills. You saw
him out there today. He's going D-1.

46:43.334 --> 46:45.935
- Troy will go D-1?
- I think so.

46:45.937 --> 46:48.738
That kid's a stud.
You know he's killing it with the ladies.

46:48.740 --> 46:50.072
- He is?
- Yeah.

46:50.074 --> 46:51.974
I found five sticks
of lipstick in his room.

46:53.178 --> 46:54.911
That seems like
a lot of lipstick.

46:54.913 --> 46:57.613
Stan was so happy to hear that
Frank was in town this weekend.

46:57.615 --> 46:59.348
Ha! Me too.

46:59.350 --> 47:01.250
You get a chance to talk
to Frank about staying home more?

47:01.252 --> 47:03.266
I brought it up to him
just like you suggested.

47:03.278 --> 47:03.953
Mm-hmm?

47:03.955 --> 47:05.354
- And he agreed.
- What?

47:05.356 --> 47:09.592
He's going to hire someone else to go
back and forth so he can be home with us.

47:09.594 --> 47:11.260
- Honey, that's fantastic.
- I know.

47:11.262 --> 47:13.262
- Cheers.
- It was so easy.

47:13.264 --> 47:14.831
Congratulations, I'm so glad.

47:14.833 --> 47:17.600
Thank you for giving me
the support.

47:17.602 --> 47:19.268
No, honey, you just needed
a little nudge.

47:19.270 --> 47:20.703
What do you got,
a moral problem with them?

47:20.705 --> 47:23.105
Come on, Frank, we can't all
be Puritans like you.

47:23.107 --> 47:26.307
Bill Clinton messed up. It's not like he's
gonna do it again when he's president.

47:31.149 --> 47:33.249
I guess no one
ever taught that kid manners.

47:50.335 --> 47:52.335
You know what, I'm gonna...

47:52.337 --> 47:55.037
- I'm gonna get some more chips, okay?
- All right.

47:55.039 --> 47:56.205
I'll take over.

47:57.041 --> 47:58.474
I'm gonna save them here.

48:00.378 --> 48:01.611
Ah, shit.

48:24.202 --> 48:25.701
Is this yours?

48:25.703 --> 48:29.171
My dad gave it to me in college,
but I wasn't any good.

48:29.173 --> 48:30.940
Go ahead. Play.

48:30.942 --> 48:33.342
No thanks. I'm not in the mood

48:33.344 --> 48:36.412
for you to criticize me
and tell me how much I suck.

48:37.682 --> 48:38.682
Hey.

48:41.286 --> 48:42.685
Stanley Kempler!

48:42.687 --> 48:45.354
I'm only giving you this
if you catch up.

48:45.356 --> 48:46.689
Warm and cheap.

48:50.895 --> 48:52.862
Wait, I'll get it. Okay.

48:52.864 --> 48:57.033
Kelly? Kelly,
is this your boyfriend?

48:57.035 --> 48:58.935
- No!
- No!

48:58.937 --> 49:01.370
- Marcy, don't embarrass the girl.
- I mean...

49:01.372 --> 49:03.306
I'm not embarrassed.
I don't have a boyfriend.

49:03.308 --> 49:05.074
Philip is Ritchie's kid.

49:05.076 --> 49:06.943
- Frank, did I meet Ritchie?
- Ah...

49:06.945 --> 49:08.544
He's very elusive.

49:09.280 --> 49:10.446
I'll give him that.

49:12.951 --> 49:17.386
You know, I could go
for some after-dinner music.

49:17.388 --> 49:19.455
- What do you say?
- Ooh, yeah. Good idea.

49:19.457 --> 49:21.057
What do you say, Philip?

49:21.059 --> 49:23.459
We got the campfire,
starry night.

49:23.461 --> 49:27.163
We got the makings for a good,
old-fashioned sing-along.

49:27.832 --> 49:29.231
Or a witch burning.

49:29.233 --> 49:31.834
Bonnie, don't we have
that guitar in the cabin?

49:31.836 --> 49:35.271
We do. We also have a rifle.
Give the kid a break.

49:35.273 --> 49:38.174
He's going to be
a big ol' rock star.

49:38.176 --> 49:40.509
I want to say I heard him
way back when.

49:40.511 --> 49:41.811
Not trying to be a rock star.

49:42.580 --> 49:44.900
- You don't know anything about me.
- You're right.

49:45.116 --> 49:47.850
Neither does your father,
according to you.

49:47.852 --> 49:49.885
He doesn't want
to know anything about me.

49:50.621 --> 49:51.621
That's for sure.

49:52.023 --> 49:53.622
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

49:53.624 --> 49:56.158
Maybe it's the other way around.
You ever thought about that?

49:56.594 --> 49:59.228
Do you know what your father
gave up just to have you?

50:00.665 --> 50:02.932
Do you know anything
about your father?

50:02.934 --> 50:05.134
- Frank!
- Besides the fact that he's a liar?

50:05.136 --> 50:06.635
Yeah, besides that.

50:06.637 --> 50:08.938
I do know that he gives me
zero encouragement.

50:08.940 --> 50:11.107
Oh, encouragement.

50:11.843 --> 50:16.512
To what? To fail?
To make a fool of yourself?

50:16.514 --> 50:17.680
Okay, Frank, that's enough.

50:17.682 --> 50:21.150
Maybe he just wants to know that
you can make the right decisions.

50:21.152 --> 50:22.651
Oh, you mean his decisions.

50:22.653 --> 50:26.789
Yeah, I followed
in my father's footsteps,

50:26.791 --> 50:28.758
and I turned out fine.

50:33.197 --> 50:36.265
Yeah, you did.
And I'm sure he'd be very proud.

50:37.135 --> 50:38.634
Excuse me, everyone.

50:40.004 --> 50:42.071
He was actually!

50:42.073 --> 50:43.305
Frank, what are you doing?

50:43.307 --> 50:44.974
I'm defending my friend!

50:44.976 --> 50:46.642
From his kid?

50:46.644 --> 50:48.811
- God, Dad! You're such an asshole?
- Oh, Kelly...

50:48.813 --> 50:51.647
Okay, Kelly, get back here! We don't
talk to each other in this family that...

50:51.649 --> 50:52.649
No, she's right.

50:55.820 --> 50:56.820
Let her go.

51:00.058 --> 51:02.558
You know they only use this
place for hookups now, right?

51:04.562 --> 51:06.262
I won't ask you
how you know that.

51:07.832 --> 51:11.367
Sorry about my dad. That was
a total dick thing to say.

51:11.369 --> 51:14.904
- He's normally not like that.
- You sure?

51:14.906 --> 51:16.705
I'm not sure
of anything anymore.

51:16.707 --> 51:19.842
Well, neither am I.
So we're in this together.

51:21.946 --> 51:23.279
Do you want to go get drunk?

51:23.848 --> 51:25.948
Ah, yeah. Let's do that.

51:26.617 --> 51:29.085
As quickly as possible, too, if we could.

51:29.520 --> 51:33.155
How was this cow milked?

51:33.858 --> 51:38.594
I believe with a great deal
of love. Now, eat your dinner.

51:39.864 --> 51:41.864
That's a lot of food
for just the two of us.

51:41.866 --> 51:44.100
Well, I made some
for your brother, too.

51:44.635 --> 51:47.837
Actually, he was
supposed to be home by now.

51:57.048 --> 51:59.315
Hi Barb, it's Laura.

51:59.317 --> 52:01.383
I'm good. I'm good, thank you.

52:01.385 --> 52:04.053
I was hoping you could
send Philip now.

52:04.055 --> 52:06.956
Because I thought he was gonna
be home for dinner tonight and...

52:08.159 --> 52:10.126
He's where?

52:37.421 --> 52:39.321
Can you believe this crowd?

52:39.323 --> 52:41.957
There's something so pathetic
about a bunch of high school kids

52:41.959 --> 52:43.859
who think that a week
of acting like idiots

52:43.861 --> 52:46.495
is gonna make up for four years
of being a wallflower.

52:49.100 --> 52:50.600
Yeah. What losers.

52:50.601 --> 52:52.101
I need to find the bathroom
and you need to find us drinks.

52:52.103 --> 52:54.036
Drinks. On it!

53:09.187 --> 53:11.020
Oh, hey!

53:11.022 --> 53:13.742
Will Philip be joining us tonight
or are we stuck with his evil twin?

53:14.158 --> 53:15.891
What are you doing here?

53:15.893 --> 53:17.660
What, did you think I was sitting
at home waiting for your call?

53:17.662 --> 53:20.296
Sorry. I mean, things
have been a little crazy.

53:20.298 --> 53:22.364
I saw you walk in
with the prodigal daughter.

53:22.900 --> 53:24.800
How come you can hang around her
without freaking out?

53:24.802 --> 53:26.002
She's way hotter than Allison.

53:26.704 --> 53:29.305
- Because she's my sister.
- She's your half-sister.

53:29.307 --> 53:30.706
That doesn't make it any better.

53:30.708 --> 53:33.242
Correction. It's half-better.

53:33.244 --> 53:35.211
Philip. Hey!

53:35.213 --> 53:38.047
Allison. You're here! I...

53:38.049 --> 53:40.482
It's my party, silly.
Of course I'm here.

53:40.484 --> 53:42.084
You're party. Okay.

53:43.487 --> 53:44.820
How do you two know each other?

53:46.057 --> 53:49.158
We don't. We met
on the drive up here.

53:49.160 --> 53:50.993
- So, yeah.
- Okay.

53:50.995 --> 53:54.930
You need to come with me.
This line is for the schleps.

53:54.932 --> 53:55.679
Yeah.

53:55.691 --> 53:57.967
Okay? I have the hard
stuff for the VIPs hidden.

54:06.510 --> 54:08.844
Eddie? Are you awake?

54:09.513 --> 54:12.348
I'm supportive, right? Of you?

54:12.350 --> 54:13.682
Not at the moment.

54:14.685 --> 54:16.819
Do I encourage you
to follow your dreams?

54:17.421 --> 54:19.688
Yes. Can I go back to sleep?

54:19.690 --> 54:23.225
Because Philip's not like you.

54:23.227 --> 54:24.927
He's less sure of himself.

54:25.696 --> 54:28.097
Do you mind if I take him
fishing tomorrow morning?

54:28.099 --> 54:29.665
I think it would be
good for him.

54:30.601 --> 54:32.034
Just this once.

54:32.036 --> 54:34.203
Just this once, okay.
Just this once...

54:34.205 --> 54:37.106
No, no, don't say that. They're
not groupies. They follow the band.

54:37.108 --> 54:39.052
I knew I recognized
you from somewhere!

54:39.064 --> 54:39.742
Yeah!

54:39.744 --> 54:41.610
One second, one second!

54:42.780 --> 54:43.780
Hello.

54:47.418 --> 54:49.018
You like her, don't you?

54:50.321 --> 54:51.553
Is it that obvious?

54:51.555 --> 54:54.023
You have a terrible poker face.

54:55.726 --> 54:57.026
You want my advice?

54:57.728 --> 54:59.395
Please do not tell me
to be myself.

54:59.397 --> 55:01.263
God no. Let the girl be herself.

55:01.265 --> 55:04.600
You think boys are the only ones
that make shit up to get laid?

55:04.602 --> 55:07.136
I've been telling everyone
this is my house.

55:16.447 --> 55:17.680
Hey!

55:19.083 --> 55:21.050
- What are you doing?
- Sleeping.

55:22.086 --> 55:25.054
- Passed out. I got home late.
- In your sister's bed?

55:28.025 --> 55:29.491
First of all, eww.

55:29.493 --> 55:31.994
Come on. We're going fishing.

55:33.097 --> 55:34.196
Okay.

55:39.603 --> 55:43.505
If this is your sick way of telling me that
I'm sleeping with the fishes, I get it.

55:44.008 --> 55:46.542
Can't a father
take his son fishing?

55:46.544 --> 55:48.210
Every month, apparently.

55:48.946 --> 55:51.347
- Eddie hates it, you know.
- I know.

55:51.349 --> 55:52.948
Then why do you
drag him out here?

55:54.452 --> 55:55.851
Because he lets me.

55:56.887 --> 56:00.689
Give me the blue chair.
Blue chair. Other blue.

56:01.392 --> 56:02.591
Okay.

56:05.629 --> 56:09.131
Relax, Philip. Have a beer.
It's spring break.

56:14.572 --> 56:15.938
That'll have to do.

56:16.474 --> 56:17.706
Here.

56:19.310 --> 56:21.877
You know the Frank that I grew
up wouldn't even drink beer,

56:21.879 --> 56:23.112
certainly not first thing
in the morning.

56:23.114 --> 56:26.115
I don't even recognize you.
It's like you're two different people.

56:27.051 --> 56:28.851
It feels like
a lot more than that.

56:28.853 --> 56:30.252
You have more families!

56:30.254 --> 56:31.553
No!

56:32.656 --> 56:35.791
God, no! Two's enough.
One's enough.

56:36.427 --> 56:39.428
I... I didn't mean for this
to happen. You know that.

56:39.430 --> 56:41.130
This was a mistake.

56:41.999 --> 56:44.600
How? How was
all of this a mistake?

56:45.669 --> 56:47.236
You wouldn't understand.

56:47.238 --> 56:49.705
Dad, okay, I really hate when
you tell me that, all right?

56:49.707 --> 56:51.507
- I'm not a kid anymore.
- Yes, you are.

56:52.410 --> 56:55.277
You're the same age I was when I
met your mother in high school.

56:55.279 --> 56:58.914
We were kids. And what I thought
were adult decisions back then

56:58.916 --> 57:01.717
were just stupid
childish idealisms.

57:01.719 --> 57:05.921
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I've
completely thrown idealism out the window.

57:06.690 --> 57:08.657
No, that doesn't make me
feel better.

57:12.897 --> 57:15.030
You have to know, Philip,

57:15.032 --> 57:17.232
there was a time when I thought
your mother was the one.

57:17.234 --> 57:18.200
I really did.

57:18.202 --> 57:22.137
Our parents were close friends.
They loved Laura.

57:23.107 --> 57:25.707
I did what everyone
did back then.

57:25.709 --> 57:27.976
I asked your mother to marry me.

57:28.612 --> 57:32.614
After our engagement party, Dad
surprised me and promoted me,

57:33.150 --> 57:36.885
sent me up here
to open his new plant.

57:36.887 --> 57:38.287
And that's when you met Bonnie?

57:38.756 --> 57:41.190
She was standing
outside of Lacy's gift shop...

57:42.726 --> 57:44.560
carrying all these canvases.

57:44.562 --> 57:48.597
She tripped or something and all
these paintings fell on the sidewalk.

57:48.599 --> 57:50.966
I went over,
kneeled down to help her...

57:52.136 --> 57:54.803
and when I did,
she looked at me.

57:56.407 --> 57:59.908
Felt like the first time
anyone ever really saw me.

57:59.910 --> 58:01.743
And we spent some time together

58:01.745 --> 58:04.746
and I felt like I could
be myself with her.

58:04.748 --> 58:07.349
Not just who
I was supposed to be.

58:08.419 --> 58:12.754
I didn't mean to lie to your mom
or cheat or anything.

58:12.756 --> 58:13.989
It just happened.

58:15.092 --> 58:17.593
I knew I had to tell her,
I had to tell both of them,

58:17.595 --> 58:20.162
but I wanted to be strategic.

58:21.098 --> 58:23.499
So once I figured out my plan,

58:23.968 --> 58:25.801
I drove back home one weekend

58:25.803 --> 58:27.703
and I was gonna
come clean to your mom.

58:27.705 --> 58:31.840
I was gonna tell her, "Look,
I found someone. We fell in love."

58:32.776 --> 58:34.510
We got to call off
the engagement."

58:35.212 --> 58:39.715
But when I drove into
your mom's parents' house,

58:39.717 --> 58:41.183
she was standing outside,

58:42.019 --> 58:44.019
saying, "I'm pregnant."

58:44.522 --> 58:45.721
With me?

58:46.390 --> 58:47.422
Yeah.

58:49.293 --> 58:50.659
So, I'm the mistake?

58:50.661 --> 58:53.128
No, Philip.

58:53.697 --> 58:55.264
I'm the mistake.

58:56.700 --> 59:00.369
And then, so you married her
because she was pregnant.

59:00.371 --> 59:01.803
It was the right thing to do.

59:02.206 --> 59:04.540
Did you tell her about Bonnie?

59:04.542 --> 59:07.976
I told her when I was up here,
I met someone and that...

59:07.978 --> 59:12.247
it was a fling, but I ended it.

59:12.249 --> 59:16.752
But when I came up here to tell Bonnie
that it couldn't work out with us...

59:18.055 --> 59:19.521
she told me was pregnant too.

59:19.523 --> 59:20.822
Jesus, Dad!

59:20.824 --> 59:22.491
I didn't know what to do.
I was frozen.

59:22.493 --> 59:24.826
I don't know why you didn't
just tell Mom from the get-go.

59:24.828 --> 59:26.328
Why didn't you
just tell her the truth?

59:26.330 --> 59:28.764
Then what happens?
She leaves me, they both leave me.

59:28.766 --> 59:30.399
That's a paralyzing thought.

59:30.401 --> 59:31.466
I'd lose both of them.

59:34.038 --> 59:37.739
But what I was most frightened
of losing were my kids.

59:41.845 --> 59:43.812
I remember the day
you were born.

59:45.382 --> 59:48.584
I held you, I looked
into your wrinkly face.

59:49.687 --> 59:54.456
And I thought I could never leave
Laura, because I could never leave you.

59:59.196 --> 01:00:02.564
I'm not crazy.
I... I knew it couldn't last.

01:00:02.566 --> 01:00:05.934
I just thought I'd hold on
a little longer, while I...

01:00:06.904 --> 01:00:08.170
found a way out.

01:00:10.274 --> 01:00:12.507
But I never did.

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.213
Well, I...

01:00:20.050 --> 01:00:21.450
At least I have Grandma Ruth.

01:00:23.587 --> 01:00:25.287
Kelly doesn't even know
that she's alive.

01:00:25.289 --> 01:00:27.289
- Which is pretty messed up, Dad.
- I know.

01:00:28.959 --> 01:00:32.394
Man, there had to be
sacrifices with each family.

01:00:34.932 --> 01:00:38.000
Whoa, shit! What do I do?

01:00:38.002 --> 01:00:39.668
- Hey, hey!
- Reel it in!

01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:42.004
I don't know how to fish.
You haven't taught me to fish.

01:00:42.006 --> 01:00:43.526
- Reel it in, reel it in.
- Wait, wait!

01:00:50.447 --> 01:00:52.214
At least I taught you
how to swim.

01:01:02.593 --> 01:01:05.260
Next time I'd use
the pole to try and catch it.

01:01:05.262 --> 01:01:06.625
Just figured
I'd do it yourself...

01:01:06.637 --> 01:01:07.095
Hey!

01:01:07.097 --> 01:01:09.798
I know you're good with your
hands, but that's just...

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:10.932
Guys, guys!

01:01:10.934 --> 01:01:12.934
Oh, hey.

01:01:12.936 --> 01:01:14.369
Where the hell you guys been?
I've been trying to find you for hours.

01:01:14.371 --> 01:01:16.104
I took my son fishing.

01:01:16.106 --> 01:01:18.666
Well, I hope your wife likes fish
then, because she's on her way.

01:01:20.144 --> 01:01:22.044
You're going to have to be
more specific.

01:01:25.883 --> 01:01:27.282
Your mother's going to kill you.

01:01:27.284 --> 01:01:29.584
Then she's gonna
ground you. Hard.

01:01:30.454 --> 01:01:33.789
Your weekend of teenage
debauchery is officially over,

01:01:33.791 --> 01:01:36.124
at least that is what
we need her to believe.

01:01:36.126 --> 01:01:38.593
There's no reason she should
think I was ever here.

01:01:39.663 --> 01:01:43.632
Buck up, kiddo. I'll do damage control
when I'm home in a couple of days.

01:01:43.634 --> 01:01:45.200
Wait, you're staying here?

01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:47.102
Of course I am.
This is my vacation.

01:01:47.971 --> 01:01:50.138
- Here. Take it.
- What, you don't want it?

01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:53.709
I know the real reason you wanted me to
go to State is because Kelly got into NYU.

01:01:53.711 --> 01:01:56.378
And you didn't want us to meet.

01:01:57.715 --> 01:02:00.148
Actually, the reason
I wanted you to go to State

01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:02.484
is so that we could
spend more time together.

01:02:05.255 --> 01:02:06.888
How do I know you're not lying?

01:02:08.992 --> 01:02:10.225
I guess you don't.

01:02:15.432 --> 01:02:17.599
I don't even know
what I'd do at NYU anyhow.

01:02:18.335 --> 01:02:20.469
What about when everyone
comes to parents' weekend?

01:02:22.106 --> 01:02:24.406
I'm already exhausted,
and it's only been like two days.

01:02:25.576 --> 01:02:27.476
You know you were going,
like, a hundred, right?

01:02:28.078 --> 01:02:30.078
That's his concern
at this moment?

01:02:35.586 --> 01:02:37.018
You're staying here?

01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:38.653
It's not ideal. But it's free.

01:02:40.691 --> 01:02:42.090
Is this jelly?

01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:43.959
Ugh.

01:02:47.297 --> 01:02:49.498
Uncle Ross, what are you doing?

01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:51.366
Charging up.

01:02:51.368 --> 01:02:53.935
- Can we get him out of here?
- Yeah, okay.

01:02:53.937 --> 01:02:56.538
Okay, come on.
No, no, we'll get it.

01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:58.540
- I just sat down.
- Yeah, we're gonna get some fresh air.

01:02:58.542 --> 01:02:59.875
Come on. Fresh air.

01:02:59.877 --> 01:03:01.209
No, no, no...

01:03:01.211 --> 01:03:04.713
- Yeah, that'll be there when we get back.
- Who the fuck is this guy?

01:03:04.715 --> 01:03:06.114
Hi, I'm Frank.

01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:07.783
What's Frank doing here?

01:03:07.785 --> 01:03:09.484
- We're leaving and you're staying?
- Yeah.

01:03:09.486 --> 01:03:11.153
It's Philip's dad,
don't worry about it, okay?

01:03:11.155 --> 01:03:12.521
Why is he here?

01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:17.058
Wow, okay, let's get rid
of everything illegal.

01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:18.393
Like a three-foot bong.

01:03:20.898 --> 01:03:23.398
- Whoa.
- It's a bit messy back there.

01:03:24.501 --> 01:03:25.534
Oh, God...

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:32.307
- "Alien Juggs"?
- It wasn't good.

01:03:37.748 --> 01:03:39.147
Ughhh.

01:03:39.149 --> 01:03:41.817
That'll have to do.

01:03:42.786 --> 01:03:45.921
Okay, I'm gonna be back
from Japan on Tuesday.

01:03:45.923 --> 01:03:47.489
Okay, so it's like
back to normal.

01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:48.771
- Yeah. Back to normal.
- Got it.

01:03:49.026 --> 01:03:50.926
Wow, it's weird.

01:03:50.928 --> 01:03:53.628
I had a real fun time, you know?

01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:54.260
Me too.

01:03:54.272 --> 01:03:56.198
It's kind of like I'm
your accomplice now.

01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:58.033
Well, that's better than
my extortionist.

01:03:58.035 --> 01:04:00.302
- Oh, it is!
- Philip...

01:04:00.304 --> 01:04:01.803
In that case, you don't have
to choose them over me.

01:04:01.805 --> 01:04:04.105
I could see you on
Thanksgiving and Christmas.

01:04:04.107 --> 01:04:06.441
Philip. You can't be
my accomplice.

01:04:06.443 --> 01:04:09.010
Things have to go back
to the way they were before.

01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:10.780
Why?

01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:16.618
I... I can't risk
losing everyone.

01:04:17.221 --> 01:04:18.587
I hope you understand that.

01:04:21.291 --> 01:04:23.859
Yeah, yeah, I do...

01:04:23.861 --> 01:04:26.361
All right, I should go.
Your mom'll be here in a minute.

01:04:28.131 --> 01:04:29.364
Frank?

01:04:30.634 --> 01:04:32.601
What... You're supposed
to be in Japan.

01:04:33.136 --> 01:04:34.636
You didn't tell her?

01:04:34.638 --> 01:04:36.071
I told her nothing.

01:04:38.208 --> 01:04:39.507
The Japan trip was canceled.

01:04:39.509 --> 01:04:41.009
- What?
- Yeah, I went home,

01:04:41.011 --> 01:04:42.978
saw that note
this numskull wrote

01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:45.547
and smelled some BS and then...

01:04:46.183 --> 01:04:48.250
- Took... I came up here.
- Yeah.

01:04:48.252 --> 01:04:51.353
And then saw him,
and here we are.

01:04:51.355 --> 01:04:53.321
Why didn't you let me know?

01:04:53.323 --> 01:04:55.490
I thought I'd have him home
before you even noticed.

01:04:55.492 --> 01:04:58.760
But once I got up here, I started thinking
about what you said the other night,

01:04:58.762 --> 01:05:03.265
about Philip and I spending more
time alone, and you were right.

01:05:03.267 --> 01:05:05.901
Ever since Lewis and his uncle
went up to the lake,

01:05:05.903 --> 01:05:08.169
it's just been me and <i> mi amigo.</i>

01:05:08.171 --> 01:05:10.071
- Yeah.
- Hanging out, talking.

01:05:10.073 --> 01:05:13.942
Like talking... Not as like father and
son, but more as like...

01:05:13.944 --> 01:05:15.677
- People.
- People.

01:05:15.679 --> 01:05:20.916
And it's been... It's been
my favorite moment ever, right?

01:05:20.918 --> 01:05:22.517
- Such a good time.
- Yeah.

01:05:22.519 --> 01:05:25.754
And I see you two, doing
the Mom and daughter bonding

01:05:25.756 --> 01:05:27.589
and I don't want to
interrupt that at all.

01:05:27.591 --> 01:05:29.858
So you guys probably want
to get back on the road.

01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:31.960
Have you seen the ice cream
shop that's on the...

01:05:31.962 --> 01:05:34.329
Actually, no,
we don't want to get back on the road.

01:05:39.069 --> 01:05:40.268
Go.

01:05:46.276 --> 01:05:49.377
You know what, Laura,
you don't want to stay here, do you?

01:05:49.379 --> 01:05:50.879
I am not going anywhere.

01:05:50.881 --> 01:05:52.881
You come and go as you please,
and so can I.

01:05:52.883 --> 01:05:55.450
And besides, I haven't been
up here in a long time.

01:05:55.452 --> 01:05:59.688
And it's the Starling Festival and
I really, really want Lib to see it.

01:06:00.891 --> 01:06:02.123
Don't drag me into this.

01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:04.225
That's exactly what
I wanted you to say.

01:06:04.227 --> 01:06:05.460
I'm thrilled you're staying.

01:06:05.462 --> 01:06:10.298
Hey, I'm gonna go to the lake
and fetch Lewis and his uncle.

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:14.369
Why don't I go? I'll go, you stay
here with your mom and your sister.

01:06:14.838 --> 01:06:17.138
And make sure they don't catch
the black plague.

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:18.640
I'll be right back, hon.

01:06:20.077 --> 01:06:22.744
Huh. Never seen one this big...

01:06:22.746 --> 01:06:24.679
Oh, hey, Dad!

01:06:25.115 --> 01:06:26.481
He left his keys.

01:06:29.953 --> 01:06:31.419
- Mom?
- Yes, darling.

01:06:31.421 --> 01:06:33.621
Is that a bullet hole?

01:06:33.623 --> 01:06:36.157
Yeah, no no!
Don't touch anything.

01:06:37.761 --> 01:06:40.161
Hey! What are you doing?

01:06:41.298 --> 01:06:43.498
- Waiting for my keys.
- Dad! What's the plan?

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:46.267
I don't know yet.
Go back inside.

01:06:46.269 --> 01:06:47.635
I'll make this work.

01:06:47.637 --> 01:06:48.837
How?

01:06:48.839 --> 01:06:51.306
Do you think this is
my first close call?

01:06:51.308 --> 01:06:53.274
You're the one who wanted
to be my accomplice,

01:06:53.276 --> 01:06:55.810
now's your chance.
Trial by fire.

01:06:55.812 --> 01:06:56.878
Like the Hindenburg.

01:07:02.619 --> 01:07:05.553
Things always have a way
of working out.

01:07:05.555 --> 01:07:09.357
Just occupy your mom and sister
for a couple hours.

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:12.293
Take them into town,
have her buy a painting.

01:07:12.295 --> 01:07:13.962
What, like one
of Bonnie's paintings?

01:07:14.464 --> 01:07:16.564
Can you do that? Yes or no.

01:07:16.566 --> 01:07:18.333
Yeah. What are you gonna do?

01:07:18.335 --> 01:07:20.635
Just go back up.
I'll figure it out.

01:07:22.806 --> 01:07:23.806
Eww.

01:07:30.213 --> 01:07:31.446
I have a plan.

01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:35.216
So, let me get this straight.

01:07:35.218 --> 01:07:36.885
You're Philip's real dad,

01:07:37.754 --> 01:07:40.989
and I'm pretending to be his
fake dad who doesn't even exist.

01:07:40.991 --> 01:07:42.390
In a nutshell.

01:07:43.493 --> 01:07:45.093
I should punch you
in the face right now.

01:07:45.562 --> 01:07:48.763
Maybe later, but for now let's
stick with elaborate deception.

01:07:48.765 --> 01:07:51.366
I written out a few notes,
a couple stories.

01:07:51.368 --> 01:07:54.636
When in doubt, a simple "I don't
want to talk about it" will do.

01:07:56.339 --> 01:07:58.239
I work at a ketchup company?

01:07:58.241 --> 01:08:01.076
We work together at a ketchup company.
And we're best friends.

01:08:01.078 --> 01:08:03.011
Okay, what's
my favorite type of car?

01:08:03.513 --> 01:08:06.915
You're choice.

01:08:06.917 --> 01:08:09.918
- I like Mustangs.
- All right, fine, you like Mustangs.

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:11.786
How did you know
I was allergic to cilantro?

01:08:11.788 --> 01:08:13.888
I didn't know
you were allergic to...

01:08:13.890 --> 01:08:17.024
- But you wrote it down.
- That was a detail about Ritchie.

01:08:17.027 --> 01:08:20.261
I was drunk and I said
you were allergic to cilantro.

01:08:20.263 --> 01:08:22.130
Can you please focus here?

01:08:22.131 --> 01:08:24.532
How long did you know my best
friend was fucking my wife?

01:08:24.533 --> 01:08:26.434
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:08:26.435 --> 01:08:29.104
All you need to concentrate on
is you work at a ketchup factory.

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:32.607
Okay. It's better
than mustard, I guess.

01:08:33.577 --> 01:08:35.443
Everybody likes ketchup.

01:08:44.421 --> 01:08:45.787
Uncle Ross? Are you okay?

01:08:46.223 --> 01:08:47.822
I think I'm depressed.

01:08:47.823 --> 01:08:51.559
Maybe sitting inside all day
smoking pot isn't helping.

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:53.428
I'm self-medicating, Frank.

01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:57.465
There's no way anyone would
ever think pot is medicine.

01:08:58.401 --> 01:08:59.667
Okay, I don't mean
to sound selfish,

01:08:59.669 --> 01:09:01.136
but where am I going to sleep?

01:09:01.738 --> 01:09:03.304
How do you feel about camping?

01:09:03.974 --> 01:09:06.808
I mean...

01:09:07.243 --> 01:09:08.776
It has its appeal.

01:09:08.778 --> 01:09:10.944
All right, I'll get you
a sleeping bag and a tent.

01:09:10.947 --> 01:09:12.346
- Let's go.
- Okay.

01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:18.486
All right, we got to go.

01:09:25.428 --> 01:09:28.763
Listen, I know we don't know
each other that well...

01:09:28.765 --> 01:09:34.602
Or at all. But I want you
to know, I'm counting on you.

01:09:34.604 --> 01:09:36.770
My children are counting on you.

01:09:41.111 --> 01:09:43.511
Wipe the tears
out of your eyes, okay?

01:09:46.883 --> 01:09:51.752
Bon, Kelly, this is
Philip's dad, Ritchie.

01:09:52.656 --> 01:09:53.688
Come on.

01:10:00.463 --> 01:10:02.363
Don't be shy.

01:10:06.069 --> 01:10:07.168
Hi.

01:10:07.170 --> 01:10:09.404
This is... Kelly.

01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:12.607
He gets claus... Ritchie?

01:10:13.143 --> 01:10:15.543
Rich. Rich!

01:10:23.987 --> 01:10:26.387
He looks like
he hasn't bathed in weeks.

01:10:26.389 --> 01:10:28.423
He's pretty down about it all.

01:10:29.659 --> 01:10:30.892
Where's Philip?

01:10:30.894 --> 01:10:35.697
Blowing off steam in town.
He's not ready to see his father just yet.

01:10:35.699 --> 01:10:37.432
He asked for our help.

01:10:37.434 --> 01:10:40.668
From what Philip's said,
his father seems like he's beyond help.

01:10:40.670 --> 01:10:43.104
It's possible Philip
exaggerated.

01:10:50.847 --> 01:10:53.448
Who's the guy taking a leak
off the dock?

01:10:54.584 --> 01:10:56.384
I should go find Philip.

01:10:56.386 --> 01:10:57.752
Yeah, do that.

01:11:03.727 --> 01:11:05.390
I like that
little sculpture there.

01:11:05.402 --> 01:11:06.094
Yeah, it's nice.

01:11:06.096 --> 01:11:08.730
This town does have its charm.

01:11:08.732 --> 01:11:10.031
Yeah, do you miss it?

01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:14.636
Sometimes. But I never really
loved it the way your father did.

01:11:17.073 --> 01:11:18.973
Hey, look.
Maybe our old cabin is for rent.

01:11:18.975 --> 01:11:21.442
Oh, yeah. Maybe
we should try and get it.

01:11:22.245 --> 01:11:23.611
This isn't happening.

01:11:34.391 --> 01:11:35.490
He's a moron.

01:11:35.492 --> 01:11:36.691
This guy's a moron.

01:11:43.667 --> 01:11:45.133
I can't understand you.

01:11:48.171 --> 01:11:49.871
Hey. Are you sure?

01:11:51.574 --> 01:11:52.674
- Positive.
- Positive.

01:11:53.076 --> 01:11:54.076
Go ahead.

01:11:59.582 --> 01:12:01.983
- What? I...
- Fuck!

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:06.921
Are you crazy? Why would
you let them go in there?

01:12:06.923 --> 01:12:08.523
What was I supposed to do?

01:12:08.525 --> 01:12:10.358
You're a teenager.
Make something up.

01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:12.627
Out of the two of us,
who do you think is the better liar?

01:12:12.629 --> 01:12:16.831
Fine! All right.
I'll handle this.

01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:18.166
- Okay.
- Follow my lead!

01:12:19.202 --> 01:12:22.170
Hey! I thought
I'd find you guys here.

01:12:22.772 --> 01:12:27.675
Oh, you know, isn't this right
around where we used to stay?

01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:29.177
It was so long ago
I don't really remember.

01:12:29.179 --> 01:12:32.046
That's kinda close to
the picnic area.

01:12:32.048 --> 01:12:33.281
It might be noisy.

01:12:33.283 --> 01:12:34.949
What if we were over here?

01:12:34.951 --> 01:12:36.617
That way we have
the lake in-between us

01:12:36.619 --> 01:12:38.619
and the noisy teenagers.

01:12:38.621 --> 01:12:43.124
Well, he's a teenager. He might enjoy
being close to it, right, Philip?

01:12:43.126 --> 01:12:45.793
- Uh...
- All right, what about this one?

01:12:45.795 --> 01:12:48.129
Oh, well actually
that looks good.

01:12:48.131 --> 01:12:49.797
Right? What do you think,
Philip?

01:12:49.799 --> 01:12:51.699
- That sounds great.
- We'll take it.

01:12:51.701 --> 01:12:53.701
Great. I'll get you the keys.

01:13:01.644 --> 01:13:04.746
We didn't actually bring any hot dogs
with us. Where did you find those?

01:13:05.148 --> 01:13:07.749
The cooler over there.
Very tasty.

01:13:08.585 --> 01:13:10.218
Dude, that's not ours.

01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:13.054
- That things been there for years.
- Delicious.

01:13:13.056 --> 01:13:14.655
Aged nicely.

01:13:15.725 --> 01:13:18.226
I haven't been outside in ages.
It's beautiful.

01:13:19.162 --> 01:13:20.595
A really nice place
you got here.

01:13:20.597 --> 01:13:22.230
Didn't this used to be
your nice place?

01:13:25.535 --> 01:13:26.735
I don't want to talk about it.

01:13:38.848 --> 01:13:40.014
Looks like a beaut.

01:13:40.016 --> 01:13:42.083
Yeah, it's not bad.

01:13:42.085 --> 01:13:45.019
You know what, Philip and I will get this.
You guys go on in.

01:13:45.021 --> 01:13:45.920
You sure?

01:13:45.922 --> 01:13:47.655
- Yeah!
- Okay.

01:13:49.058 --> 01:13:50.158
Check it out.

01:13:50.527 --> 01:13:51.859
It smells.

01:13:51.861 --> 01:13:53.261
Oh, that's just nostalgia.

01:13:54.197 --> 01:13:57.532
Okay, now that your mother
has the cabin,

01:13:57.534 --> 01:14:01.436
we can get Ross back to his
place before he blows our cover.

01:14:01.438 --> 01:14:03.271
And what exactly is "our cover"?

01:14:03.273 --> 01:14:06.707
Ross is at Bonnie's
pretending to be Ritchie.

01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:08.943
That's awesome.
He's probably weeping in a corner.

01:14:08.945 --> 01:14:11.245
That works for our story.
It's fine.

01:14:11.247 --> 01:14:14.816
It's not fine! If Bonnie finds
out, then Mom's gonna find out!

01:14:14.818 --> 01:14:16.951
- And then...
- Calm down. Trust me.

01:14:16.953 --> 01:14:21.756
All you got to do is go over to Bonnie's
and make up with your dad, Ritchie.

01:14:21.758 --> 01:14:23.224
Then you both leave.

01:14:23.226 --> 01:14:24.559
You come here.

01:14:24.561 --> 01:14:27.862
Ross goes back to his vortex
he crawled out of.

01:14:28.431 --> 01:14:29.997
And then you're out of it, okay?

01:14:29.999 --> 01:14:31.833
You guys, what's the holdup?

01:14:31.835 --> 01:14:33.901
We're just having
a little man-to-man talk.

01:14:33.903 --> 01:14:36.137
Talking like guys, you know?

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:39.907
Sports, drinking, strippers.

01:14:39.909 --> 01:14:42.143
- What?
- Less is more.

01:14:42.145 --> 01:14:46.581
Actually, Philip and Lewis
had a small disagreement.

01:14:46.583 --> 01:14:47.849
- About what?
- Girls.

01:14:47.851 --> 01:14:49.183
- Ohhh. Yeah.
- A girl.

01:14:49.185 --> 01:14:51.419
- Ladies of the evening.
- No, a girl.

01:14:51.421 --> 01:14:53.955
Well,
so I'm gonna go apologize to him.

01:14:53.957 --> 01:14:57.625
Like I said, you should
apologize, you should come clean.

01:14:57.627 --> 01:15:00.761
- Honesty is the best policy.
- Policy. You got it. Thanks, Dad.

01:15:00.763 --> 01:15:02.697
I thought Lewis was gay.

01:15:14.110 --> 01:15:15.110
Oh!

01:15:16.646 --> 01:15:17.845
Ah!

01:15:28.057 --> 01:15:30.191
You and Philip seem better.

01:15:30.193 --> 01:15:31.193
We are.

01:15:32.629 --> 01:15:33.961
You and Lib having fun?

01:15:33.963 --> 01:15:35.897
Yeah. Though, of course,
she'd never admit it.

01:15:36.533 --> 01:15:41.002
It is really nice being back here.
This town has barely changed.

01:15:41.004 --> 01:15:42.970
Maybe we should come up
here for Labor Day.

01:15:42.972 --> 01:15:45.873
That's a good one.

01:15:45.875 --> 01:15:47.208
What's so funny?

01:15:47.210 --> 01:15:49.544
Oh, come on, Frank.
Let's not kid ourselves.

01:15:50.146 --> 01:15:52.880
This place hasn't changed,
but we have.

01:15:52.882 --> 01:15:56.884
You know, we don't even know how
to talk to each other anymore.

01:16:03.109 --> 01:16:04.829
Laura, I know there are
a lot of things I...

01:16:06.029 --> 01:16:08.896
wish I had done differently,
if I could go back.

01:16:09.999 --> 01:16:12.166
I'm gonna go get the cooler.

01:16:12.168 --> 01:16:14.008
- I can get it.
- No, I got it.

01:16:14.871 --> 01:16:16.003
Look, why don't I just...

01:16:16.005 --> 01:16:17.338
No, I've got it.

01:16:21.678 --> 01:16:23.711
- What's his name?
- I'm not gonna tell you.

01:16:25.682 --> 01:16:28.149
- There you are!
- Hey, uh...

01:16:29.519 --> 01:16:31.018
My dad here?

01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:33.020
He's in the shower.
But he should be out soon.

01:16:33.022 --> 01:16:34.755
Where have you been?

01:16:34.757 --> 01:16:38.259
Well, I've been out.
Getting some air.

01:16:38.728 --> 01:16:40.261
- Scoping the scene.
- Son!

01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:43.130
- I've missed you so much.
- Hey. Yeah.

01:16:43.132 --> 01:16:44.432
I've missed you, too, Dad.

01:16:44.434 --> 01:16:47.735
Yeah, hey, let's talk.

01:16:47.737 --> 01:16:50.871
- What?
- We just need to bury the hatchet.

01:16:51.541 --> 01:16:53.841
Okay. Where do they keep it?

01:16:54.277 --> 01:16:56.077
No, we just...

01:16:56.079 --> 01:16:58.799
We have to make up in front of them,
and then we can get out of here.

01:16:58.948 --> 01:17:01.282
Now? Bonnie's making tacos.

01:17:02.385 --> 01:17:03.484
Just, okay.

01:17:03.486 --> 01:17:05.219
So, Dad, um...

01:17:06.489 --> 01:17:09.190
I've been thinking
about it a lot and I...

01:17:10.927 --> 01:17:12.126
I forgive you.

01:17:14.731 --> 01:17:17.531
Well, I don't forgive you.

01:17:19.502 --> 01:17:22.436
You ready for my comeback?
I'm feeling lucky now.

01:17:22.438 --> 01:17:23.438
Hit me.

01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:26.741
Booyeah! Blackjack.
What'd I tell you?

01:17:27.410 --> 01:17:30.177
There you go. Pay up, kid.
Another roll. Give it to me.

01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:33.180
- Keep it coming.
- You think you can beat your dad?

01:17:33.783 --> 01:17:36.150
Me? Yeah. I'll try.

01:17:36.152 --> 01:17:38.919
- Good, good for you. Maybe that one there?
- Yeah.

01:17:38.921 --> 01:17:40.254
This one.
Probably this one here...

01:17:40.256 --> 01:17:41.256
He's late.

01:17:41.591 --> 01:17:42.790
Late for what?

01:17:42.792 --> 01:17:45.526
Well, for... this!

01:17:46.462 --> 01:17:49.330
You know. Family time.

01:17:49.332 --> 01:17:52.433
Exactly. Why should I be
the only one to suffer?

01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:59.173
I should go get him.

01:18:12.121 --> 01:18:16.957
Well, well, well. Look who finally
decided to show up for Taco Night.

01:18:16.959 --> 01:18:18.726
- Hey!
- Hey, Dad.

01:18:18.728 --> 01:18:20.895
I'm gonna wash up.

01:18:21.998 --> 01:18:25.466
You know what?
I'm gonna wash up too.

01:18:36.512 --> 01:18:37.812
What's taking so long?

01:18:37.814 --> 01:18:39.714
It's like a hostage situation
in there.

01:18:39.716 --> 01:18:43.718
Ritchie, I mean Ross,
refuses to make up with me.

01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:46.821
Does Bonnie think he's your dad?

01:18:46.823 --> 01:18:48.489
- Yeah.
- Great!

01:18:48.491 --> 01:18:51.392
Fine. Then follow my lead.
I'll handle it.

01:18:51.394 --> 01:18:53.694
Wait, wait. So, Dad,
what happens after this?

01:18:53.696 --> 01:18:56.263
Go back to the cabin.
I'll meet you there later.

01:18:56.265 --> 01:18:59.467
I mean, what happens
after this weekend. With us.

01:19:00.670 --> 01:19:02.870
Are you really going to stop
traveling like Bonnie said?

01:19:03.272 --> 01:19:04.605
Stay here with them more?

01:19:07.376 --> 01:19:08.376
Yeah.

01:19:12.014 --> 01:19:15.316
So, I'm the second family.
Aren't I?

01:19:17.019 --> 01:19:18.385
I don't know what you mean.

01:19:18.387 --> 01:19:20.855
- Yes, you do.
- Wash your hands.

01:19:20.857 --> 01:19:23.691
Never tell
a lie you can't prove.

01:19:23.693 --> 01:19:26.494
We are so far from number one
at this point.

01:19:30.533 --> 01:19:32.399
- Only vegetables.
- Well, you like hummus.

01:19:32.401 --> 01:19:34.368
- I love hummus.
- Yeah, those are chickpeas.

01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:36.370
- That's a vegetable.
- I don't think so.

01:19:36.372 --> 01:19:37.805
- They're a legume.
- I don't know what that means.

01:19:37.807 --> 01:19:39.607
It means it's a vegetable.

01:19:39.609 --> 01:19:44.311
Ritchie, Philip has a couple things
he'd like to talk to you about.

01:19:44.313 --> 01:19:47.515
So that you can
clear the air here.

01:19:48.117 --> 01:19:50.417
I'd appreciate if
you'd keep an open mind.

01:19:50.419 --> 01:19:53.220
Sure, yeah. My mind has
never been more open. Shoot.

01:19:53.222 --> 01:19:55.656
Okay, um...

01:19:56.993 --> 01:20:00.127
I hate you for cheating on Mom.

01:20:01.564 --> 01:20:03.330
Philip, you don't hate
your father.

01:20:03.332 --> 01:20:04.732
Let him finish, sweetheart.

01:20:04.734 --> 01:20:06.934
And your whole life is a lie.

01:20:06.936 --> 01:20:11.405
And it makes me feel like I
have nothing real in my life.

01:20:11.407 --> 01:20:12.447
And I hate how that feels.

01:20:15.678 --> 01:20:17.011
Yeah. I know what you mean.

01:20:18.447 --> 01:20:19.547
So, uh...

01:20:21.017 --> 01:20:22.316
promise me
you'll never tell her.

01:20:22.752 --> 01:20:24.418
- Huh?
- What?

01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:26.921
I don't want Mom
to ever know the real truth.

01:20:26.923 --> 01:20:28.622
Her or the other woman.

01:20:28.624 --> 01:20:31.659
'Cause I don't ever want them
to know what this feels like.

01:20:31.661 --> 01:20:36.330
And I know that losing them
will hurt you too.

01:20:36.332 --> 01:20:38.499
Philip, your father
can take care of himself.

01:20:38.501 --> 01:20:40.100
- No, he can't.
- Yes, he can.

01:20:40.102 --> 01:20:41.869
Because he's been
lying his entire life,

01:20:41.871 --> 01:20:43.637
he doesn't even know
who he is anymore.

01:20:43.639 --> 01:20:45.539
- I'm Ritchie.
- Listen to me, Philip.

01:20:45.541 --> 01:20:48.375
- I'm Ritchie.
- Your father is an asshole.

01:20:48.377 --> 01:20:50.377
He doesn't know shit from...

01:20:50.379 --> 01:20:51.979
- Dad!
- Oh, my God!

01:20:51.981 --> 01:20:53.981
- Ritchie!
- No, please!

01:20:53.983 --> 01:20:55.216
- Oh, God.
- Stop it!

01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:00.955
All right, I'm done here.
I'm done. Let's go.

01:21:00.957 --> 01:21:02.246
You heard your father.

01:21:02.258 --> 01:21:04.859
Come on. I forgive you or whatever.
Come on.

01:21:04.861 --> 01:21:06.721
Honey, are you okay?
Are you sure?

01:21:06.733 --> 01:21:07.628
Yeah, yeah.

01:21:07.630 --> 01:21:10.297
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
- Oh, God.

01:21:10.299 --> 01:21:13.167
- Okay, here we go.
- I'm fine. These tacos are good.

01:21:13.169 --> 01:21:14.835
Yeah.

01:21:14.837 --> 01:21:17.705
- Ritchie's horrible.
- Yeah, he's got a temper.

01:21:18.808 --> 01:21:21.842
Okay, you can go back
to your apartment now.

01:21:21.844 --> 01:21:23.077
Go back to my apartment?

01:21:23.713 --> 01:21:26.747
And miss the starlings tomorrow?
No, not a chance.

01:21:27.817 --> 01:21:29.416
He's just terrible.

01:21:29.418 --> 01:21:32.686
Yeah, he's, you know,
he's going through something.

01:21:32.688 --> 01:21:35.155
Wait, should he
have left with his father?

01:21:35.157 --> 01:21:38.092
Yup. Yeah, they're good.
Mission accomplished.

01:21:39.161 --> 01:21:41.095
Listen kid,
you need me right now.

01:21:41.664 --> 01:21:42.830
You need me.

01:21:42.832 --> 01:21:44.365
And I'm going to be here for you
no matter what.

01:21:44.367 --> 01:21:47.601
You're not my dad anymore, so...

01:21:47.603 --> 01:21:49.637
Yeah, I know. Do you think
he would say that?

01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:54.408
- You don't know my father.
- I do. I do know your father.

01:21:55.044 --> 01:21:56.076
I know him very well.

01:21:56.078 --> 01:22:00.014
Now you may think you want
to keep his secrets for him.

01:22:00.016 --> 01:22:03.517
Hoping it'll somehow protect the
people you love from experiencing pain,

01:22:03.519 --> 01:22:04.519
but it won't.

01:22:05.054 --> 01:22:07.254
It won't, Philip.
Lies are for cowards.

01:22:08.124 --> 01:22:09.790
Your dad is a coward.

01:22:10.359 --> 01:22:12.259
Are you?

01:22:14.964 --> 01:22:16.163
Um...

01:22:17.199 --> 01:22:18.432
I got to go.

01:22:32.048 --> 01:22:33.280
Lewis!

01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:35.616
Lewis.

01:22:43.392 --> 01:22:44.512
It's not what it looks like.

01:22:47.797 --> 01:22:49.396
Philip, wait. Philip!

01:22:49.398 --> 01:22:51.465
Why can't anyone
just tell me the truth?

01:22:52.134 --> 01:22:54.201
Wait, wait, hold on. Hold on.

01:22:55.471 --> 01:22:57.071
You're mad at me
for lying to you?

01:22:57.073 --> 01:22:59.173
What about you, huh?
You're completely unrecognizable.

01:22:59.175 --> 01:23:02.476
You're ending up just like your dad,
despite whatever efforts you're making.

01:23:04.246 --> 01:23:06.714
Why... Why didn't you
just tell me?

01:23:08.317 --> 01:23:10.317
I didn't know how.

01:23:11.754 --> 01:23:13.654
- We're best friends.
- I know.

01:23:15.291 --> 01:23:16.323
It's...

01:23:16.325 --> 01:23:20.828
It's just that everybody knows
that you can't keep a secret.

01:23:25.835 --> 01:23:26.867
You okay, man?

01:23:27.937 --> 01:23:30.571
- Yeah, I'm...
- What's going on?

01:23:34.176 --> 01:23:35.509
Nothing I can't handle.

01:23:35.511 --> 01:23:36.511
So...

01:23:40.049 --> 01:23:42.182
Come on, here. Hug me.

01:23:47.523 --> 01:23:50.858
I'll um... see you tomorrow.

01:23:51.494 --> 01:23:52.893
Good luck tonight.

01:23:53.562 --> 01:23:55.696
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do, all right?

01:23:57.833 --> 01:23:58.833
Have a good night.

01:24:12.848 --> 01:24:14.815
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:24:14.817 --> 01:24:17.885
I was just seeing if they were
setting up for the festival yet.

01:24:17.887 --> 01:24:18.986
Hmm.

01:24:18.988 --> 01:24:20.654
You're a terrible liar.

01:24:23.426 --> 01:24:24.958
I hope I've made you happy.

01:24:26.495 --> 01:24:28.395
Of course you have.

01:24:33.335 --> 01:24:34.568
Is this about Ritchie?

01:24:35.671 --> 01:24:37.271
Yeah. Yeah...

01:24:39.608 --> 01:24:41.241
You know I love you, right?

01:24:41.877 --> 01:24:42.943
I really do.

01:24:44.180 --> 01:24:45.412
I do know.

01:24:45.948 --> 01:24:46.948
I love you too.

01:24:51.220 --> 01:24:53.020
- Come inside?
- Um...

01:24:53.589 --> 01:24:57.191
I'm gonna clear my head
out here a little bit longer.

01:24:57.193 --> 01:24:59.426
Okay. But come in soon, hmm?

01:25:07.870 --> 01:25:09.269
Mom...

01:25:11.874 --> 01:25:13.006
am I just like Dad?

01:25:13.976 --> 01:25:14.976
Parts of you are.

01:25:15.811 --> 01:25:18.879
Because I don't
necessarily wanna be.

01:25:20.216 --> 01:25:22.116
Philip, your dad has flaws.

01:25:22.118 --> 01:25:25.619
But if you keep expecting him
to change his behavior

01:25:25.621 --> 01:25:27.287
and you know that he can't,

01:25:27.923 --> 01:25:30.124
then you're only going to be
disappointing yourself.

01:25:30.826 --> 01:25:34.728
At some point, you just have
to accept his flaws

01:25:34.730 --> 01:25:37.598
as part of who he is
and then love him anyway.

01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:39.867
Do you... love him?

01:25:43.572 --> 01:25:46.507
What kind of question is that?

01:25:48.577 --> 01:25:49.710
There you are.

01:25:50.513 --> 01:25:51.645
What happened to you?

01:25:51.647 --> 01:25:54.948
I was with Lewis. I'm tired.

01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:57.417
I think we all are.
I think we should all get to bed.

01:25:57.419 --> 01:25:59.920
We've got a big day tomorrow.

01:25:59.922 --> 01:26:02.055
- All right, good night.
- Good night.

01:26:06.195 --> 01:26:07.394
Is he okay?

01:26:08.430 --> 01:26:10.831
He will be.

01:27:17.066 --> 01:27:18.165
You going on a run?

01:27:18.167 --> 01:27:20.334
No, I mean. Yeah.

01:27:20.336 --> 01:27:22.069
But it's a short one.

01:27:22.071 --> 01:27:23.570
Give me a second,
I'll grab my shoes.

01:27:23.572 --> 01:27:26.873
No, I'd rather
go solo this time.

01:27:26.875 --> 01:27:29.509
But I will see you guys
at the Starling Festival.

01:27:30.045 --> 01:27:33.080
- Same table?
- Same table!

01:27:42.524 --> 01:27:44.024
Do you know the last time

01:27:44.026 --> 01:27:46.526
anyone saw a starling
at the Starling Festival?

01:27:46.528 --> 01:27:48.595
The very first
Starling Festival!

01:27:48.597 --> 01:27:51.298
They based their entire holiday around
something that happened one time.

01:27:51.300 --> 01:27:53.533
Every holiday is based off of
something that happened one time.

01:27:53.535 --> 01:27:55.269
Fuck!

01:28:05.948 --> 01:28:07.881
Um... what?

01:28:08.584 --> 01:28:10.751
Where did your father come from?

01:28:10.753 --> 01:28:13.220
Jogging. Yeah, he went jogging.

01:28:13.222 --> 01:28:15.222
Since when does Dad jog?

01:28:15.224 --> 01:28:19.059
Well, I mean, you know,
it's never too late to start. Right, Mom?

01:28:20.296 --> 01:28:23.030
I believe it looks like
it's a bit too late for him.

01:28:23.732 --> 01:28:25.232
He's fine.

01:28:25.234 --> 01:28:28.502
In fact, I'm gonna get him
some water and aspirin.

01:28:28.504 --> 01:28:31.838
Why don't you guys head on
down to the Starling Festival?

01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:35.075
I will deal with Dad.
And we'll meet you there.

01:28:35.077 --> 01:28:37.144
- Okay. All right.
- All right? Yeah.

01:28:37.146 --> 01:28:39.112
Don't bother him.
I'll take care of it.

01:28:39.114 --> 01:28:40.681
He's cranky when he sweats.

01:28:44.853 --> 01:28:46.420
Really shouldn't run
around like that, Dad.

01:28:46.422 --> 01:28:48.355
Men your age die
mowing the lawn.

01:28:48.357 --> 01:28:49.517
Let's just get through today.

01:28:51.927 --> 01:28:53.660
I'm gonna go to the festival,
meet Bonnie.

01:28:54.296 --> 01:28:57.164
She'll take me back to the cabin
to mend my sprained ankle.

01:28:57.166 --> 01:28:59.499
- You sprained your ankle?
- Of course not.

01:28:59.501 --> 01:29:03.236
Anyway, you keep your mother
and Lib here until I get back.

01:29:04.606 --> 01:29:06.506
Dad, they're gone.

01:29:09.111 --> 01:29:10.644
- What do you mean?
- They left.

01:29:10.646 --> 01:29:11.778
I told them we would
meet them there.

01:29:11.780 --> 01:29:13.547
Why would you do that?

01:29:14.783 --> 01:29:20.153
Because with them gone that
gives us a chance to figure...

01:29:20.155 --> 01:29:22.522
Where's my binoculars?

01:29:23.359 --> 01:29:25.625
Shit. They're at
the other house.

01:29:25.627 --> 01:29:27.661
I thought we could
figure out the plan.

01:29:27.663 --> 01:29:30.030
Now there's no plan. No plan!

01:29:30.032 --> 01:29:32.399
There's no way we can get there
before they meet each other.

01:29:32.401 --> 01:29:35.235
Okay. Well, then, it's settled.
We'll fake our own deaths.

01:29:38.140 --> 01:29:39.339
It's over.

01:29:39.341 --> 01:29:43.310
No, hey Dad, you've done this
a thousand times!

01:29:43.312 --> 01:29:45.846
Come on, I'm sure you have
a dozen ways to figure this out.

01:29:45.848 --> 01:29:47.814
It's too late. All right?

01:29:47.816 --> 01:29:49.850
They left. They're going
to the same place!

01:29:49.852 --> 01:29:52.486
You said there was always
a way of working things out.

01:29:52.488 --> 01:29:55.555
What? What do you think,
a speed boat's gonna drop

01:29:55.557 --> 01:29:57.057
in the lake
to take us over there,

01:29:57.059 --> 01:29:58.492
so they don't meet each other!

01:29:58.494 --> 01:30:01.261
Woo-hoo!

01:30:25.854 --> 01:30:27.387
- Excited?
- Not really.

01:30:27.389 --> 01:30:29.689
You should be.

01:30:29.691 --> 01:30:31.425
Sign our petition
for animal rights!

01:30:31.427 --> 01:30:33.293
Oh, okay. Hold this. Thanks!

01:30:33.862 --> 01:30:36.763
Okay, yeah, I've got it.
Don't worry about me.

01:30:36.765 --> 01:30:40.000
Philip, tie it off.
Tie it off, go. Go.

01:30:42.371 --> 01:30:43.637
Hey!

01:30:44.373 --> 01:30:45.605
Hi, Bonnie!

01:30:45.607 --> 01:30:47.207
Hi, Barb!

01:30:47.209 --> 01:30:48.642
Is Dad here yet?

01:30:48.644 --> 01:30:49.943
Well, he should be.

01:30:49.945 --> 01:30:51.311
I'm gonna try to find Philip.

01:30:51.313 --> 01:30:53.880
Okay, we'll see you
at the table. Hi!

01:30:53.882 --> 01:30:55.115
Come on!

01:31:15.304 --> 01:31:18.071
Dad, you go that way!
I'll get Mom. You get Bonnie.

01:31:30.085 --> 01:31:32.752
Hey, there you are!
Can I talk to you?

01:31:32.754 --> 01:31:34.588
- Yeah, just...
- Why are you hiding?

01:31:35.023 --> 01:31:36.756
Is that girl Allison here?

01:31:36.758 --> 01:31:39.593
No, no. I was hiding
from my sister.

01:31:39.595 --> 01:31:40.994
Yeah, she's kinda clingy.

01:31:40.996 --> 01:31:42.762
Wow, you must think I'm crazy.

01:31:42.764 --> 01:31:44.831
Actually, I think you're
the sanest one here.

01:31:46.168 --> 01:31:47.901
Wait? When did
your sister get here?

01:31:48.537 --> 01:31:49.703
She, uh...

01:31:50.472 --> 01:31:51.538
- Dad!
- Hey, buddy.

01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:53.974
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:31:53.976 --> 01:31:55.709
I just wanna make sure
your mom has enough ketchup.

01:31:55.711 --> 01:31:56.776
Are you mad at me or something?

01:31:56.778 --> 01:31:58.278
No. Why would you say that?

01:31:58.280 --> 01:31:59.713
You've been acting
really weird lately.

01:31:59.715 --> 01:32:01.081
Oh, no.

01:32:02.284 --> 01:32:03.617
Oh!

01:32:04.152 --> 01:32:06.920
- I'm sorry, I...
- It's okay.

01:32:08.223 --> 01:32:10.457
- We can share.
- Great, thank you!

01:32:10.459 --> 01:32:12.292
You didn't go running with me.

01:32:12.294 --> 01:32:14.394
You've been gone for a long time and
I just wanted to spend time with you.

01:32:14.396 --> 01:32:16.963
I thought
we could throw this Frisbee...

01:32:16.965 --> 01:32:19.533
- Dad? Are you even listening to me?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:32:19.535 --> 01:32:22.335
I feel like you're avoiding
me, and I just...

01:32:22.337 --> 01:32:25.305
I feel like there's
this connection between us.

01:32:25.307 --> 01:32:28.875
Like we're two halves of the
same person or something.

01:32:28.877 --> 01:32:32.045
I've never been able to be myself
like I am when I'm with you.

01:32:32.047 --> 01:32:34.047
And I think you feel
the same way.

01:32:34.049 --> 01:32:36.416
Actually, I'm not myself at all.

01:32:36.418 --> 01:32:39.052
I'm Ritchie.

01:32:39.555 --> 01:32:40.987
It's a family recipe,
you want one?

01:32:40.989 --> 01:32:42.989
We haven't spent
much time together.

01:32:42.991 --> 01:32:44.858
- I wanna spend time with you.
- Can we talk about this later?

01:32:44.860 --> 01:32:47.727
We need to talk now, Dad.
I hate fishing!

01:32:47.729 --> 01:32:48.451
Okay.

01:32:48.463 --> 01:32:50.664
And why have you never invited
me to the ketchup factory?

01:32:50.666 --> 01:32:52.098
Sorry, kid. Nice shorts.

01:32:52.100 --> 01:32:53.500
I got to borrow your dad.
Man stuff.

01:32:53.502 --> 01:32:55.068
- Dad!
- Ketchup.

01:32:56.939 --> 01:32:59.539
So which one of these guys
is yours?

01:32:59.541 --> 01:33:00.907
Um...

01:33:02.277 --> 01:33:05.512
There. There he is. See?
That guy, the big lug?

01:33:05.514 --> 01:33:07.347
Oh, shit. They see us. Wave.

01:33:07.849 --> 01:33:10.016
- Hi, sweetie!
- Big smile.

01:33:10.018 --> 01:33:11.952
Oh, he's standing
with my husband.

01:33:11.954 --> 01:33:14.287
- Keep waving. Big smile.
- I'm waving.

01:33:14.289 --> 01:33:15.922
You're Philip's mom?

01:33:16.858 --> 01:33:19.392
- You know Philip?
- Yes!

01:33:19.394 --> 01:33:22.062
Mom, do we really have to stay
for this pointless ritual?

01:33:22.064 --> 01:33:25.265
- Yes, honey, we do.
- Ooh, brownies. Excuse me.

01:33:25.267 --> 01:33:28.435
Oh, my, okay. Do you know
where your brother is?

01:33:29.204 --> 01:33:31.037
Um... yeah.

01:33:31.039 --> 01:33:32.572
He's over there
talking to that girl.

01:33:32.574 --> 01:33:34.574
- That's my daughter.
- That's your daughter?

01:33:34.576 --> 01:33:36.209
- Yes!
- Oh, my gosh!

01:33:36.211 --> 01:33:38.144
I know your dad's an asshole
who doesn't let you do anything,

01:33:38.146 --> 01:33:40.213
and mine lets me get away
with murder.

01:33:40.215 --> 01:33:43.450
But there is one thing
my dad said I could never do.

01:33:45.087 --> 01:33:47.120
- Oh, no...
- What's that?

01:33:47.556 --> 01:33:48.788
Fall for you.

01:33:50.158 --> 01:33:52.559
- I didn't see that happening.
- No, no, bad lie.

01:33:52.561 --> 01:33:53.793
Bad, bad lie.

01:33:53.795 --> 01:33:57.230
No, no. No! Stop!

01:33:57.833 --> 01:33:59.432
- Frank?
- Frank?

01:33:59.434 --> 01:34:00.900
No! You can't kiss him!

01:34:01.570 --> 01:34:03.570
- I can kiss whoever I want.
- No, you can't.

01:34:03.572 --> 01:34:05.238
- Why?
- 'Cause he's...

01:34:05.807 --> 01:34:06.973
your brother!

01:34:08.577 --> 01:34:09.676
What?

01:34:09.678 --> 01:34:11.277
And my son.

01:34:11.279 --> 01:34:13.480
This is a joke, right?
I mean, he's joking.

01:34:13.482 --> 01:34:14.614
Kelly, I can explain.

01:34:14.616 --> 01:34:15.849
Dad, what's going on?

01:34:17.686 --> 01:34:19.319
- Frank?
- Wait, no, Kelly. I...

01:34:20.188 --> 01:34:22.188
Why did she call you "Dad"?

01:34:22.190 --> 01:34:25.859
Oh, my God.
This is her, isn't it?

01:34:26.628 --> 01:34:28.395
What? Her... What?

01:34:29.765 --> 01:34:32.265
I have no idea who you are.

01:34:32.267 --> 01:34:35.235
I have a very good idea
of who you are.

01:34:36.638 --> 01:34:38.438
Frank, what is
she talking about?

01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:38.903
Bonnie.

01:34:38.915 --> 01:34:40.340
I can't believe you.
All these years?

01:34:40.342 --> 01:34:43.276
All these years?
You never ended it?

01:34:43.278 --> 01:34:45.345
Mom, Mom, it's not
what it looks like.

01:34:45.347 --> 01:34:47.914
- I can explain.
- Philip, stop! It's over.

01:34:49.284 --> 01:34:51.551
It should never have
gotten this far, I'm sorry.

01:34:51.553 --> 01:34:53.620
What is over, Frank?

01:34:53.622 --> 01:34:56.623
You can just tell them what you told me!
He never meant to hurt anyone!

01:34:56.625 --> 01:34:58.224
Wait a minute, you knew?

01:34:58.226 --> 01:35:03.063
Wait? I'm the woman your dad
is having an affair with?

01:35:03.065 --> 01:35:06.166
Jesus, Frank,
you involved Philip!

01:35:06.168 --> 01:35:07.901
What is wrong with you?

01:35:07.903 --> 01:35:09.335
- Dad, who is this woman?
- This is my mom.

01:35:09.337 --> 01:35:11.071
- Who are you?
- I'm his son.

01:35:11.073 --> 01:35:13.807
This really just gets
better and better.

01:35:13.809 --> 01:35:17.377
Mom, you said that we need to
allow people to have their flaws,

01:35:17.379 --> 01:35:20.246
that we should accept them,
and not fight them, remember?

01:35:20.248 --> 01:35:21.381
I think that's a good idea.

01:35:21.817 --> 01:35:23.316
Shut the fuck up!

01:35:23.719 --> 01:35:26.619
Philip, this is not a flaw.

01:35:29.825 --> 01:35:31.091
This is betrayal.

01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:34.661
- Laura...
- What? What are you gonna say?

01:35:34.663 --> 01:35:36.563
Come out with it. Come on.

01:35:36.565 --> 01:35:41.401
Because after today, I don't want to see
you in anything but a full body cast.

01:35:41.403 --> 01:35:44.938
Oh, my God. Is this...
Is this really happening?

01:35:47.542 --> 01:35:48.542
Full body cast.

01:35:52.013 --> 01:35:53.947
No, no, no!

01:36:01.690 --> 01:36:04.157
Hey. Hello. I'm Ritchie.

01:36:05.460 --> 01:36:06.793
Are you kidding?

01:36:06.795 --> 01:36:08.875
You have really beautiful eyes.
Anyone tell you that?

01:36:09.464 --> 01:36:11.097
You know that song
"Brown Eyed Girl"?

01:36:12.567 --> 01:36:13.633
Where are you going?

01:36:14.703 --> 01:36:16.136
Philip!

01:36:20.442 --> 01:36:22.142
So what's up? What's going on?

01:36:23.812 --> 01:36:25.111
What's everyone up to?

01:36:26.314 --> 01:36:28.114
If you need someone
to talk to, I'm here.

01:36:31.553 --> 01:36:32.553
I'm Ritchie.

01:36:32.888 --> 01:36:35.054
- Oh, hey, Allison.
- Hey.

01:36:35.056 --> 01:36:37.390
I'm not in a band.
I lied to you. I'm sorry.

01:36:37.392 --> 01:36:38.691
But I think I'm
in love with you.

01:36:39.895 --> 01:36:40.994
Good-bye!

01:36:40.996 --> 01:36:42.295
I know what you're doing!

01:36:42.297 --> 01:36:43.997
You should! It was your idea!

01:36:51.907 --> 01:36:53.540
Ah! That was close.

01:37:02.818 --> 01:37:04.117
Is he okay?

01:37:04.119 --> 01:37:06.052
I don't know.
Let's just get out of here.

01:37:10.759 --> 01:37:13.026
Are we dead?

01:37:15.163 --> 01:37:16.696
Is there a Plan C?

01:37:22.103 --> 01:37:24.504
I think I pooped a little.

01:37:25.707 --> 01:37:27.173
Me too.

01:37:28.343 --> 01:37:30.343
But not a little.

01:37:35.283 --> 01:37:36.716
Those birds are beautiful.

01:37:38.286 --> 01:37:40.687
Are those... starlings?

01:37:45.994 --> 01:37:47.393
What if there's more of us?

01:37:47.395 --> 01:37:51.197
How do I know the next girl I date
won't be some long-lost half-sister

01:37:51.199 --> 01:37:52.632
that tries to make out with me!

01:37:52.634 --> 01:37:56.135
Oh, please, we didn't even kiss!

01:37:56.137 --> 01:37:57.817
Which of you are
Frank and Philip's family?

01:38:01.376 --> 01:38:04.244
Oh, so Philip's doing well.

01:38:04.246 --> 01:38:07.380
He's just got a couple of bruises,
but he'll be fine. He's discharged.

01:38:07.983 --> 01:38:10.650
Frank, on the other hand,
we're looking at three broken ribs.

01:38:10.652 --> 01:38:12.485
No internal bleeding, luckily.

01:38:12.487 --> 01:38:14.420
But he does have
a fractured tibia.

01:38:14.422 --> 01:38:16.222
- We'll be setting the cast tonight.
- So they're both still alive?

01:38:16.224 --> 01:38:18.825
Yes. You're all very lucky.

01:38:18.827 --> 01:38:20.059
I wouldn't go that far.

01:38:20.862 --> 01:38:24.631
Um... if you guys wanna come see
them, you can follow me.

01:38:26.401 --> 01:38:27.500
Lib...

01:38:29.905 --> 01:38:32.538
tell your brother that I'll
be waiting for him in the car.

01:38:32.540 --> 01:38:35.308
- You're not going in?
- No, sweetie, I, uh...

01:38:37.545 --> 01:38:38.578
I can't.

01:38:41.016 --> 01:38:43.182
Go on.

01:38:43.184 --> 01:38:44.851
- It's okay.
- Thanks.

01:38:44.853 --> 01:38:46.653
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

01:39:53.421 --> 01:39:57.991
Look, I know I owe
all of you an explanation.

01:39:57.993 --> 01:39:59.425
I don't know where to start.

01:39:59.427 --> 01:40:01.961
You never showed up
to my 7th birthday party.

01:40:01.963 --> 01:40:05.732
Was there an emergency at work?
Or were you just with... them?

01:40:08.169 --> 01:40:10.770
Laura went into early labor
with Lib.

01:40:10.772 --> 01:40:12.605
Wait, what?

01:40:12.607 --> 01:40:16.009
And why didn't you come with us to
Uncle Sam's wedding? The real truth.

01:40:16.511 --> 01:40:19.679
Eddie fell off his bike
and broke his arm.

01:40:19.681 --> 01:40:23.182
All those trips to Japan?
Were you even ever there?

01:40:25.387 --> 01:40:26.786
I've never been to Japan.

01:40:26.788 --> 01:40:30.723
What the fuck!
Do you think this is okay?

01:40:31.292 --> 01:40:34.127
Do you think we feel sorry for
you now that you're lying here?

01:40:34.129 --> 01:40:35.962
- No.
- Why did you do this?

01:40:38.033 --> 01:40:39.021
I did everything you wanted.

01:40:39.033 --> 01:40:40.633
Stop it, stop it.
What does this accomplish?

01:40:40.635 --> 01:40:44.070
What's the difference between
one lie and 100?

01:40:44.072 --> 01:40:46.672
I just want to hear one
true thing come out of your mouth.

01:40:47.142 --> 01:40:49.776
One sliver of honesty.

01:40:50.311 --> 01:40:51.644
I thought...

01:40:55.650 --> 01:40:57.650
I thought I was doing
the right thing.

01:40:57.652 --> 01:41:02.555
I lied, but I never lied
about loving my family.

01:41:03.925 --> 01:41:04.925
Wow.

01:41:06.161 --> 01:41:08.828
Bon, you got to forgive me.

01:41:08.830 --> 01:41:10.930
Forgive you?
How can I forgive you?

01:41:12.333 --> 01:41:14.367
You think
you've done nothing wrong.

01:41:14.369 --> 01:41:18.404
I've been living a lie
for 18 years! And you let me.

01:41:20.508 --> 01:41:22.475
I'm never forgiving you.

01:41:23.511 --> 01:41:26.479
And what's worse is that
now I have to forgive myself

01:41:27.515 --> 01:41:32.318
for ever having been
stupid enough to love you.

01:41:44.265 --> 01:41:45.431
You coming?

01:41:47.302 --> 01:41:49.302
Go. Go!

01:41:49.304 --> 01:41:50.703
Come on.

01:42:09.057 --> 01:42:10.890
Mom, I'm sorry.

01:42:10.892 --> 01:42:12.091
What?

01:42:12.093 --> 01:42:16.329
Philip, none of this
is your fault.

01:42:17.265 --> 01:42:18.464
None of it.

01:42:19.934 --> 01:42:21.033
Are you going to leave him?

01:42:27.909 --> 01:42:28.975
Yes.

01:42:31.479 --> 01:42:33.880
But I should have left him
a long time ago.

01:42:36.417 --> 01:42:40.820
But, Philip...
He'll always be your dad.

01:42:42.457 --> 01:42:43.756
Always.

01:43:30.171 --> 01:43:32.205
Aren't you
related to <i> The Beatles?</i>

01:43:32.807 --> 01:43:36.742
Oh, no, my father is
a philandering mastermind.

01:43:37.312 --> 01:43:40.646
What a coincidence. Mine is too.
Looks like we're neighbors.

01:43:40.648 --> 01:43:42.148
Is that what we are?

01:43:42.150 --> 01:43:43.849
It is if anyone asks.

01:43:43.851 --> 01:43:45.084
Hold the door!

01:43:48.423 --> 01:43:49.722
You've got to be kidding.

01:43:51.226 --> 01:43:52.625
Do you want me
to take the stairs?

01:43:53.494 --> 01:43:55.428
I want you to take the window.

01:44:06.341 --> 01:44:07.640
See you later, Frank.

01:44:09.277 --> 01:44:11.043
Welcome to the dojo.

01:44:11.045 --> 01:44:11.573
Nice.

01:44:11.585 --> 01:44:13.345
Shower looks like
someone was murdered in it.

01:44:13.414 --> 01:44:14.513
Ideal.

01:44:14.515 --> 01:44:19.452
Did you wash your clothes before packing
them? Because I don't think I did.

01:44:20.855 --> 01:44:21.855
Hi, Kelly.

01:44:23.424 --> 01:44:24.991
I should finish unpacking.

01:44:31.132 --> 01:44:34.000
I'd give that some time.

01:44:35.436 --> 01:44:37.003
I don't think that'll fix it.

01:44:37.605 --> 01:44:38.938
Hey, you never know.

01:44:41.409 --> 01:44:42.608
Wow.

01:44:43.444 --> 01:44:45.044
- So this is it?
- Yeah.

01:44:45.046 --> 01:44:47.046
This is.

01:44:53.388 --> 01:44:54.654
See you at Thanksgiving?

01:44:55.223 --> 01:44:57.290
Mom already got Thanksgiving.

01:44:57.792 --> 01:44:59.191
New Years' Eve, then.

01:45:01.129 --> 01:45:02.695
We'll play it by ear.

01:45:06.167 --> 01:45:07.199
I got something for you.

01:45:11.639 --> 01:45:13.472
Wait, isn't that yours?

01:45:14.108 --> 01:45:17.510
Well, my father gave it to me
in college, but...

01:45:18.313 --> 01:45:20.713
it never really belonged to me.

01:45:26.487 --> 01:45:28.054
I think it looks better
on you anyway.

01:45:28.990 --> 01:45:29.990
Thanks, Dad.

01:45:35.196 --> 01:45:36.929
Don't smoke crack.

01:45:36.931 --> 01:45:38.731
Okay.
