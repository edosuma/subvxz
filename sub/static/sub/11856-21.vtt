WEBVTT

00:36.667 --> 00:38.917
If old FDR could have squeezed
out another couple of weeks

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
he'd have seen this war end.

00:40.083 --> 00:41.250
Yeah, and my stint's
gonna end here

00:41.333 --> 00:42.583
if McDuff gets a gander at this.

00:42.667 --> 00:43.834
I can't make heads
or tails out of this story.

00:43.917 --> 00:45.375
Alright,
Birdie,
let me see
it.

00:45.458 --> 00:46.625
Do you mind? I mean,
it's alright there, Lo, just--

00:46.709 --> 00:48.208
(Lo)
'Highlight these good
details.'

00:48.291 --> 00:50.583
Allied troops
celebrating,
dancing polkas.

00:50.667 --> 00:52.208
And use active verbs.

00:52.291 --> 00:55.291
This is breaking news, not
your grandma's knitting
circle.

00:55.375 --> 00:57.208
I see him,
Birdie.
Almost done.

00:57.291 --> 00:59.959
Birdsol! Our boys
are finally coming
home.

01:00.041 --> 01:01.417
Uh, looks like it, sir.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.291
Well, this war's bound
to have made some heroes.

01:03.375 --> 01:04.875
Philadelphia needs
to read about hers.

01:04.959 --> 01:06.875
- Features, Mr. McDuff?
- Fast as you can write 'em.

01:06.959 --> 01:08.291
The first one's on its way.

01:08.375 --> 01:09.792
Well, if that's as good
as your last few

01:09.875 --> 01:11.583
we'll need to save room
above the fold.

01:11.667 --> 01:12.875
How about me, Mr. McDuff?

01:12.959 --> 01:15.041
(McDuff)
'Oh, uh..'

01:15.125 --> 01:16.625
- Crumb cakes.
- Excuse me?

01:16.709 --> 01:19.208
I wanna hear what kind
of victory vittles the
ladies

01:19.291 --> 01:21.542
are baking for the soldiers
coming home from the war.

01:21.625 --> 01:23.917
Red, white and blue
Jell-O gelatin.

01:25.250 --> 01:27.333
That's a story
gals will go dizzy for.

01:28.959 --> 01:30.792
I like your spirit. So, what
do you say, Miss Kinney?

01:30.875 --> 01:33.041
- You think you can manage
that?
- Sure, I can write that.

01:33.125 --> 01:35.208
And then maybe something
on this United Nations idea?

01:35.291 --> 01:36.625
You know, Mrs. R was saying
it might

01:36.709 --> 01:38.166
put an end to these big wars
and I was--

01:38.250 --> 01:40.166
Pipe down, sugar,
you hardly have time as it
is.

01:40.250 --> 01:42.417
You know the rule.
6 o'clock. Ladies out.

02:44.208 --> 02:45.667
Uh, is it true?

02:45.750 --> 02:47.500
- Jeffries got demoted?
- Disciplined.

02:47.583 --> 02:48.959
The bosses have put him
on desk duty.

02:49.041 --> 02:51.166
- For how long?
- Undetermined.

02:51.250 --> 02:52.625
Well, that's gonna
make him nuts.

02:52.709 --> 02:54.375
Doesn't help that
his birthday's this week.

02:54.458 --> 02:56.750
Oh, right.
Double whammy.

02:56.834 --> 02:58.417
Whatever you do,
don't mention it to him.

02:58.500 --> 03:00.709
He was very clear.
No cake, no presents.

03:00.792 --> 03:02.583
- I got it.
- 'Lieutenant?'

03:02.667 --> 03:05.667
- Detective. Looking for you.
- Hey, Tommy.

03:05.750 --> 03:07.458
Will Jeffries has
some
right hook, huh?

03:07.542 --> 03:09.917
Off the record,
that guy had it coming.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.667
Rumor is your paper's
going out of business.

03:11.750 --> 03:14.166
Yeah, I guess everyone's
getting their news online
now.

03:14.250 --> 03:16.250
Me? I'm still
terrified
of e-mail.

03:16.333 --> 03:19.041
- Newsroom's clearing out, huh?
- 'Yeah, place is like a tomb.'

03:19.125 --> 03:21.083
I, uh, was going
through the
archives

03:21.166 --> 03:23.041
before they trash everything.

03:23.125 --> 03:24.250
I found something
that might interest
you.

03:24.333 --> 03:25.750
Oh, yeah? What's that?

03:25.834 --> 03:28.250
You guys know
about the "Sentinel's"
ghost?

03:28.333 --> 03:30.125
- Lo Kinney?
- Yeah, I've heard tell.

03:30.208 --> 03:32.583
Uh, old-time
reporter
that got killed,
right?

03:32.667 --> 03:35.250
While most lady reporters
were writing about
casseroles

03:35.333 --> 03:37.333
she traveled the world
with Eleanor Roosevelt.

03:37.417 --> 03:39.083
A gal ahead of her time.

03:39.166 --> 03:41.834
Death's on the books
as a purse snatching gone
bad

03:41.917 --> 03:44.166
but the lore is
it was more than
that.

03:44.250 --> 03:46.166
Something in the archives
back that up?

03:46.250 --> 03:48.458
In a box of her old files,
I found a note

03:48.542 --> 03:49.625
dated the day she died.

03:49.709 --> 03:50.959
Saying what?

03:51.041 --> 03:53.792
"Lawndale Station.
10:00 p.m.

03:53.875 --> 03:55.792
This will not stand."

03:55.875 --> 03:57.709
Lawndale Station significant?

03:57.792 --> 04:00.000
(Tommy)
'It's where she was killed.'

04:00.083 --> 04:01.583
Hit by the 10:00 p.m. train.

04:38.959 --> 04:40.166
(Valens)
'Hey!'

04:40.250 --> 04:41.583
It's the birthday boy.

04:41.667 --> 04:44.125
Just stepped right in
it,
didn't you?

04:44.208 --> 04:46.500
It's a bummer
about the desk duty.

04:46.583 --> 04:49.041
But, uh, this will get
your mind off it.

04:49.125 --> 04:51.166
- I hooked you up.
- Hooked me up for what?

04:51.250 --> 04:53.208
Tickets to Lena's show.

04:53.291 --> 04:54.542
Wednesday night.

04:54.625 --> 04:56.583
Did I not tell you
to ignore my birthday?

04:56.667 --> 04:57.959
I read between the lines.

04:58.041 --> 04:59.458
(Rush)
'Good morning.'

04:59.542 --> 05:02.125
- What do we got?
- Lorena Kinney.

05:02.208 --> 05:05.709
Hit by a train
at Lawndale Station, 1945.

05:05.792 --> 05:07.083
"Agony aunt?"

05:07.166 --> 05:09.000
Yeah, what they used to call
advice columnists.

05:09.083 --> 05:12.208
Lorena was the "Dear, Abby"
of the "Sentinel."

05:12.291 --> 05:14.458
Purse strap was found
with the body, but no
purse?

05:14.542 --> 05:17.000
Looked like she resisted
a robbery, things got violent.

05:17.083 --> 05:18.875
But this note
found in her files

05:18.959 --> 05:21.542
suggests Lo was meeting
someone there.

05:21.625 --> 05:24.750
(Jeffries)
'"Lawndale Station. 10:00 p.m.
This will not stand."'

05:24.834 --> 05:27.208
Someone was threatening Lo.
She goes to meet them..

05:27.291 --> 05:29.375
Things get heated, she gets
pitched under the train.

05:29.458 --> 05:31.375
Makes the author
of the note the doer.

05:31.458 --> 05:32.875
There are three more boxes
of her files

05:32.959 --> 05:34.667
at the "Sentinel."
I'll start digging.

05:34.750 --> 05:36.917
And I'll, uh, visit
the last to see.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.583
It's a fellow reporter,
Davis Birdsol.

05:39.667 --> 05:40.917
And I'll be at my desk.

05:46.166 --> 05:47.583
(Birdsol)
'Lo Kinney.'

05:50.333 --> 05:52.750
She was a crackerjack news gal.

05:52.834 --> 05:56.542
Our girl on the scene
during the FDR years.

05:56.625 --> 05:58.583
I thought she was
a gossip columnist.

05:58.667 --> 06:00.792
- Advice.
- 'Yeah, well, that was
later.'

06:00.875 --> 06:04.750
You see, Eleanor Roosevelt
championed lady reporters.

06:04.834 --> 06:08.250
But when FDR died, gals
got sent back to the minors.

06:08.333 --> 06:11.750
So Lo's demoted,
now she's an agony aunt.

06:11.834 --> 06:14.083
Ten-cent reporter
in a five-cent job.

06:14.166 --> 06:15.875
(Vera)
'We're looking back
into her death'

06:16.000 --> 06:17.208
thinking maybe it wasn't
just a purse snatching.

06:17.291 --> 06:18.625
- No kidding?
- 'Yeah.'

06:18.709 --> 06:20.375
We think she might
have been meetin'

06:20.458 --> 06:22.291
someone at the station
that night.

06:22.375 --> 06:24.041
Uh, any ideas who?

06:24.125 --> 06:26.917
Ladies were kicked out
of the newsroom at 6 o'clock.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.542
I don't know what
she did with her evenings.

06:28.625 --> 06:30.125
She didn't have a guy?

06:30.208 --> 06:33.875
A firecracker like Lo wasn't
dating material in the 40s.

06:33.959 --> 06:35.583
Did she have any enemies
at the "Sentinel?"

06:35.667 --> 06:38.583
Someone who hated her enough
to shove her onto the tracks?

06:38.667 --> 06:42.542
You kind of knew it would
all end in tears with Lo.

06:42.625 --> 06:44.000
It was just too dangerous

06:44.083 --> 06:46.375
to stick a wild bird
like her in the hen house.

06:58.542 --> 07:01.125
So what's the breaking news
in the hen house?

07:01.208 --> 07:04.000
"Dear, Lo,
in a real pickle here.

07:04.083 --> 07:05.458
"Will a polka-dot frock

07:05.542 --> 07:08.375
'or a flower-print dress
turn my Jack's head?"'

07:08.458 --> 07:09.917
"Dear, In A Pickle.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.667
"You wanna turn your Jack's
head, say boo to the frock

07:12.750 --> 07:14.458
and show him
the birthday suit."

07:15.792 --> 07:18.667
That gal's asking you
a serious question, Lo.

07:18.750 --> 07:20.750
Serious?
What Truman's gonna do

07:20.834 --> 07:22.417
about the Japanese,
that's serious.

07:22.500 --> 07:24.875
Women don't wanna be bothered
with war talk.

07:24.959 --> 07:27.417
'Cause meat pies and nylons
are so much more interesting.

07:29.250 --> 07:30.750
(male #1)
'Hi, Miss Russell.'

07:30.834 --> 07:32.959
You got that newly-wed survey
going to, uh..

07:33.041 --> 07:34.750
...Martha Body on Spruce?

07:34.834 --> 07:37.500
(Birdsol)
'Think that last paragraph's
too much, Lo?'

07:37.583 --> 07:40.166
[chuckles]
Kind of a laugh.

07:40.250 --> 07:43.208
You giving romantic advice.

07:43.291 --> 07:45.458
Oh, really? Why's that?

07:45.542 --> 07:46.959
What do you know about it?

07:47.041 --> 07:49.875
- You're a childless, old
maid.
- Take a powder, Helen.

07:49.959 --> 07:53.667
Women all over this city live
by the advice in "Dear, Lo."

07:53.750 --> 07:55.083
Well, they shouldn't.

07:55.166 --> 07:57.750
Women's page is good for
wrapping fish, and nothing
more.

07:57.834 --> 08:02.041
[scoffs]
You blow in, steal my job..

08:02.125 --> 08:04.458
...then act like you've got
something better to do?

08:04.542 --> 08:05.709
Your job?

08:05.792 --> 08:07.125
I should have gotten
that column.

08:10.500 --> 08:12.375
I know what women care about.

08:12.458 --> 08:14.166
Soon as McDuff gives me
a real beat

08:14.250 --> 08:16.333
the "Dear, Lo" column
is all yours.

08:17.792 --> 08:20.041
All fixed up, Birdie.

08:27.041 --> 08:29.250
Those two fought
like alley cats.

08:29.333 --> 08:32.000
And Helen had some toys
in the attic?

08:32.083 --> 08:34.500
Had some crack-ups
over the years.

08:34.583 --> 08:36.291
Spent time
in mental
hospitals.

08:36.375 --> 08:38.583
Was she loopy enough
to try and hurt Lo?

08:38.667 --> 08:40.792
She did benefit from her dying.

08:40.875 --> 08:42.041
Yeah? How?

08:42.125 --> 08:44.291
With Lo gone,
Helen got that column.

08:45.542 --> 08:46.792
She's still writing it.

08:56.333 --> 08:58.083
(Miller)
'So you took over Lo's
column.'

08:58.166 --> 09:01.583
Changed "Dear, Lo" to "Hey,
Helen," and the rest is
history.

09:01.667 --> 09:03.709
We hear you had a few bumps
along the way.

09:03.792 --> 09:05.583
Uh, an altercation
on a city bus.

09:05.667 --> 09:07.250
Misunderstanding.

09:07.333 --> 09:08.792
(Miller)
'Hospital stay
after disrupting a wedding.'

09:08.875 --> 09:10.417
Locked the bride
in the choir room

09:10.500 --> 09:12.125
and walked down
the aisle yourself?

09:12.208 --> 09:13.875
She wasn't really right for him.

09:13.959 --> 09:17.333
We were wondering if,
in one of these colorful
periods

09:17.417 --> 09:18.625
you did something to Lo.

09:18.709 --> 09:20.417
Like shove her
in front of a train?

09:20.500 --> 09:21.875
Like that, yeah.

09:21.959 --> 09:24.000
We know you wanted
that column pretty bad.

09:25.709 --> 09:27.417
You girls are lucky.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.959
You have no idea what it's
like with a ceiling above you

09:30.041 --> 09:31.667
blocking how far you can rise.

09:31.750 --> 09:33.583
Not much room for women
at the paper?

09:33.667 --> 09:35.875
Hardly room for one,
much less two.

09:35.959 --> 09:39.041
So for you to succeed,
Lo had to go.

09:39.125 --> 09:41.792
Look, I'm a crazy, old broad.
I admit it.

09:41.875 --> 09:45.166
But Lo was making enemies
more dangerous than me.

09:45.250 --> 09:46.625
(Miller)
'How's that?'

09:46.709 --> 09:48.583
She was offering some pretty
progressive advice

09:48.667 --> 09:49.917
'in that column.'

09:50.000 --> 09:51.625
- And that got her in
trouble?
- 'Sure did.'

09:51.709 --> 09:54.166
The hen house
became a hornet's nest

09:54.250 --> 09:56.083
after some of her ideas
hit the street.

10:01.792 --> 10:03.333
(male #2)
'Lo Kinney?'

10:03.417 --> 10:04.709
That's me.

10:04.792 --> 10:07.083
Hey, where do you get off
telling my wife to..

10:07.166 --> 10:09.667
"Beat feet if your dogface
came home from the war

10:09.750 --> 10:11.959
more interested in his buddies
than his bride."

10:15.875 --> 10:17.542
I gave that advice
to a girl who wrote
in

10:17.625 --> 10:19.792
saying her husband
stopped coming home
nights.

10:19.875 --> 10:22.291
And when he did, he was
always
stinkin'. That's where.

10:22.375 --> 10:23.583
Man can't come home
from the front and blow off

10:23.667 --> 10:25.125
a little steam, is that it?

10:25.208 --> 10:26.834
(Lo)
'Not when he's got a family
to think of.'

10:26.917 --> 10:29.041
Carousing, blowing
your service benefits

10:29.125 --> 10:30.375
liquoring up?

10:30.458 --> 10:32.709
'The 52-20 Club
is for layabouts, mister'

10:32.792 --> 10:34.834
and it's making your
wife
nutso with worry.

10:34.917 --> 10:36.834
You got no idea about my life.

10:36.917 --> 10:39.709
- What I been through.
- I know what your wife
wrote.

10:39.792 --> 10:41.709
And you think that's worth
throwing away what we got?

10:41.792 --> 10:43.250
For cryin' out loud, lady,
you..

10:44.625 --> 10:46.417
You married?

10:46.500 --> 10:48.333
Haven't had time.
Haven't missed it.

10:48.417 --> 10:50.333
(male #2)
'So you don't really
know what you're talking
about'

10:50.417 --> 10:53.417
having been left on the shelf
past expiration yourself.

10:53.500 --> 10:57.291
- She is over 30.
- Shut your pie hole, Helen.

10:57.375 --> 10:59.750
And you sure as heck
ain't never been to war.

10:59.834 --> 11:02.500
Wives and soldiers don't
have any lock on common sense.

11:04.875 --> 11:06.250
I oughta put a crimp in you.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.291
You're not the first
one
to threaten it.

11:08.375 --> 11:10.125
Yeah, well..

11:10.208 --> 11:11.458
Maybe I'll be the last.

11:19.500 --> 11:20.917
I enjoyed it.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.542
I did.

11:22.625 --> 11:24.959
Especially that
"left on the shelf"
business.

11:26.542 --> 11:28.792
Did Lo get a lot
of angry visitors?

11:28.875 --> 11:30.750
And she usually mouthed
right back

11:30.834 --> 11:33.375
but this one rattled her.

11:33.458 --> 11:35.500
Seemed to scare her.

11:35.583 --> 11:37.083
(Miller)
'Any chance
you remember his name?'

11:37.166 --> 11:39.583
Save us trying to match
that story to the sender?

11:39.667 --> 11:41.000
Lo got a lot of letters.

11:41.083 --> 11:44.458
No. It's the stories
that stick, not their names.

11:46.250 --> 11:47.375
Sorry.

11:55.458 --> 11:58.750
(Miller)
'"Dear, Lo, my husband
says frosted foods'

11:58.834 --> 12:01.208
"are for single gals
and stumblebums.

12:01.291 --> 12:04.583
Who's right?
Signed, a Busy
Bee."

12:04.667 --> 12:07.041
I guess that makes me
a stumblebum.

12:07.125 --> 12:09.291
Single gal.

12:09.375 --> 12:11.625
Hey, man,
you're making me nervous.

12:11.709 --> 12:12.917
Why don't you sit down?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.458
'Cause my ass
has been planted all day.

12:15.542 --> 12:16.959
Growing roots in that seat.

12:19.709 --> 12:22.083
Maybe box number three
is the lucky one.

12:22.166 --> 12:24.583
Hey, I think I got it.

12:24.667 --> 12:28.041
- Yeah?
- "June 1st, 1945."

12:28.125 --> 12:30.792
"My soldier's been home three
months but something's wrong.

12:30.875 --> 12:33.291
"He's out till all hours
always soused

12:33.375 --> 12:35.792
and doesn't want word one
with me."

12:35.875 --> 12:37.959
It sounds right.
Who signed it?

12:38.041 --> 12:40.625
- "Should I Scram?"
- That ain't helpful.

12:40.709 --> 12:42.542
Return address on the envelope.

12:42.625 --> 12:44.917
"Mrs. Arthur Pool,
Gildar Street."

12:45.000 --> 12:46.500
Gildar's in Fox Chase.

12:46.583 --> 12:48.375
Train station out there..

12:48.458 --> 12:49.583
...Lawndale.

12:49.667 --> 12:51.875
So, maybe this Arthur
lures our girl

12:51.959 --> 12:53.500
out to his local train stop.

12:53.583 --> 12:55.875
Just in time to meet
the 10 p.m. express.

13:02.333 --> 13:04.291
(male #3)
'Arthur Pool was my father.'

13:04.375 --> 13:05.667
He just passed away.

13:06.834 --> 13:08.375
I'm sorry.

13:08.458 --> 13:09.959
We're sitting shiva for him.

13:10.041 --> 13:13.542
We're here about a
homicide.
Your dad knew our victim.

13:13.625 --> 13:15.792
[sighs]
Well, he obviously
can't help you.

13:17.375 --> 13:19.208
Her name was Lorena Kinney.

13:19.291 --> 13:21.834
Your mom wrote to her
for advice, back in
'45.

13:21.917 --> 13:23.750
Which ticked your dad
off
pretty good.

13:23.834 --> 13:25.792
My dad did not kill Lo.

13:25.875 --> 13:28.208
- So you knew her?
- I met her in this house.

13:28.291 --> 13:30.083
Really? 'Cause we heard
she and your dad

13:30.166 --> 13:31.709
went toe-to-toe
in the newsroom.

13:31.792 --> 13:35.417
She came here the next day,
and that's when she met Noah.

13:35.500 --> 13:37.458
- Who's that?
- My uncle.

13:37.542 --> 13:39.917
(Valens)
'He live with you?'

13:40.000 --> 13:41.709
Lucky for me.

13:41.792 --> 13:43.333
He was my real father figure.

13:43.417 --> 13:46.041
'Cause your dad came home
from the war in rough
shape?

13:46.125 --> 13:46.959
Right.

13:47.041 --> 13:48.375
Noah taught me
how to be a kid.

13:49.792 --> 13:51.250
Shoot marbles

13:51.333 --> 13:53.709
ask out a girl,
drive.

13:53.792 --> 13:54.917
Nice.

13:55.041 --> 13:57.291
What was Lo's
relationship
with Noah?

13:59.333 --> 14:02.000
Love...at first sight.

14:05.500 --> 14:08.041
I'm here to apologize,
I guess.

14:08.125 --> 14:11.208
A good reporter's got to hear
both sides of a story.

14:11.291 --> 14:12.750
You willing to tell it?

14:12.834 --> 14:15.417
Look, uh, I love my wife.

14:17.500 --> 14:19.166
But the things I seen and..

14:19.250 --> 14:21.250
...and done in this war..

14:21.333 --> 14:24.083
...those memories gotta
stay out of this house.

14:24.166 --> 14:28.792
Daddy, me and Uncle Noah saw
"Pinocchio" and got marbles.

14:28.875 --> 14:30.583
That's nice, Davey.

14:30.667 --> 14:33.000
Now, don't go
interrupting
the grown-ups, you
hear?

14:36.875 --> 14:40.000
Oh, we play later, David.
What do you say, hmm?

14:43.041 --> 14:44.417
It will be our secret.

14:46.208 --> 14:48.291
Noah, this is, uh, Lo Kinney.

14:48.375 --> 14:50.792
'The advice lady
I was moaning about.'

14:50.875 --> 14:53.041
- Pleased to meet you.
- Likewise.

14:53.125 --> 14:55.417
I am a fan of your
column,
"Dear, Lo."

14:55.500 --> 14:58.166
- Now, that's bunk.
- No, it's true.

14:58.250 --> 15:03.041
A month ago, a woman asks
what type of curtains you
use

15:03.125 --> 15:06.500
and you tell her, none,
so you can see the sky.

15:06.583 --> 15:08.166
Quite a memory you got.

15:08.250 --> 15:10.500
Especially since I was
shoveling
it pretty hard, quite frankly.

15:10.583 --> 15:12.792
Oh, you strike me
as the type of
woman

15:12.875 --> 15:14.667
to whom the truth..

15:14.750 --> 15:16.417
...is everything.

15:18.417 --> 15:20.166
Haven't lived long
in Philadelphia?

15:20.250 --> 15:22.166
Uh, Noah's from, uh, Holland.

15:22.250 --> 15:24.291
- 'Swal..'
- 'Swalmen.'

15:24.375 --> 15:26.166
And she doesn't
care
to hear about me.

15:26.250 --> 15:27.375
Sure. Sure, I do.

15:30.041 --> 15:31.250
I mean,
that-that's what I do.

15:31.333 --> 15:33.834
I listen to people.

15:33.917 --> 15:37.959
Uh, turns out, uh,
Noah and I are third cousins.

15:38.041 --> 15:41.500
He made it out of Europe right
when it was getting real bad.

15:41.583 --> 15:43.000
How did you swing that?

15:43.083 --> 15:46.500
During the war, um,
things are
confusing.

15:46.583 --> 15:50.125
Um, I escaped
and made to
Switzerland.

15:50.208 --> 15:53.917
He got out of that camp,
Auschwitz.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.875
Is that right?

15:55.959 --> 15:58.834
- I hear it was horrible.
- Yes.

15:58.917 --> 16:00.875
Now, that's a story
people should hear.

16:02.667 --> 16:05.208
What if I tell
you
other stories?

16:05.291 --> 16:07.166
What if you tell me
all your stories?

16:09.458 --> 16:10.959
Maybe I will.

16:14.333 --> 16:16.375
So Lo was your uncle's girl.

16:16.458 --> 16:18.542
Um, lady friend was his term.

16:18.625 --> 16:21.500
Oh, so much for
Helen's
old maid theory.

16:21.583 --> 16:23.041
Is Noah here now?

16:23.125 --> 16:25.500
He was, but this time of day,
he's home.

16:26.792 --> 16:27.959
Painting up a storm.

16:36.041 --> 16:37.166
Noah Pool?

16:38.458 --> 16:39.959
'Detectives Miller and Vera.'

16:41.083 --> 16:42.917
Hmm, come on in.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.458
I don't get many visitors here.

16:45.542 --> 16:46.750
Dark stuff.

16:46.834 --> 16:48.625
Maybe that's why no visitors.

16:48.709 --> 16:50.834
Mr. Pool, we're here
about Lorena Kinney.

16:50.917 --> 16:53.125
Yeah, David said you were
looking into her death.

16:54.333 --> 16:56.333
You think it wasn't an accident?

16:56.417 --> 16:57.709
Maybe not.

16:57.792 --> 16:59.834
That's awful.

16:59.917 --> 17:01.542
(Vera)
'We heard you two were an
item.'

17:01.625 --> 17:04.583
[chuckles]
From the moment we met.

17:04.667 --> 17:05.792
But there's no mention of you

17:05.875 --> 17:07.083
in the police report
when she died.

17:07.166 --> 17:08.458
I didn't come forward.

17:08.542 --> 17:10.625
- It's kind of strange.
- I was illegal.

17:10.709 --> 17:12.417
I wasn't even supposed to exist.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.417
And you were worried the cops
were gonna send you back?

17:14.500 --> 17:17.458
They would have,
and I had nothing to go back
to.

17:18.709 --> 17:21.750
Family, friends, all dead.

17:21.834 --> 17:24.000
(Miller)
'Right before her death,
Lo received a note'

17:24.083 --> 17:25.834
saying,
"This will not stand."

17:25.917 --> 17:28.250
And setting up a meet
at the train station.

17:28.333 --> 17:30.083
Where she was killed.

17:30.166 --> 17:31.625
You didn't write it, did you?

17:31.709 --> 17:33.250
(Noah)
'No.'

17:33.333 --> 17:38.041
Lo was my second chance
after so much darkness.

17:38.125 --> 17:40.917
'I came here to start over,
and there she was.'

17:41.000 --> 17:42.834
Light.

17:44.375 --> 17:46.667
When she died though, that..

17:46.750 --> 17:48.291
...light went out for good.

17:48.375 --> 17:51.208
Can you think of anyone who
could have written that to
her?

17:53.500 --> 17:55.041
Yes.

17:55.125 --> 17:56.208
One person.

18:03.166 --> 18:04.792
Cotton candy.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.166
- Oh!
- Pretty good, huh?

18:07.542 --> 18:10.959
- That is so sweet.
- Ha ha. The war's almost
over.

18:11.041 --> 18:13.208
We're starting
to get sugar again.

18:13.291 --> 18:15.291
It's nice, this place.

18:15.375 --> 18:17.000
'Seeing the sky.'

18:17.083 --> 18:20.041
For a long time, I see it
only through barbed wire.

18:20.125 --> 18:22.333
Must have felt like
the world was ending.

18:22.417 --> 18:24.291
Oh, it was ending.

18:25.750 --> 18:27.583
Will you ever go back
to Holland?

18:27.667 --> 18:30.792
- Why would I?
- Family, your childhood home.

18:30.875 --> 18:32.834
No, there's nothing there.

18:32.917 --> 18:34.083
Not even me.

18:35.333 --> 18:37.000
Whoever I thought I was

18:37.083 --> 18:39.417
I left that person behind.

18:39.500 --> 18:40.834
I think I know the feeling.

18:45.166 --> 18:46.125
Noah.

18:46.208 --> 18:48.000
You're here now.

18:48.083 --> 18:49.500
When they came for us..

18:51.291 --> 18:52.333
...they put us on trains.

18:53.667 --> 18:56.041
That is the last
time
I saw my mother..

18:56.125 --> 18:57.500
...my sisters..

18:57.583 --> 19:00.250
...and I got separated
from my father at the
camp.

19:00.333 --> 19:02.083
I never saw them again.

19:02.166 --> 19:04.417
- How long were you there?
- Three years.

19:04.500 --> 19:07.291
I lived because I could paint.

19:08.625 --> 19:10.375
The guards liked that.

19:10.458 --> 19:11.667
What did they like about it?

19:12.959 --> 19:14.500
I painted their portraits.

19:16.500 --> 19:18.333
For hours..

19:18.417 --> 19:20.083
...I'd look at their faces.

19:20.166 --> 19:22.125
These men who kill my family.

19:24.083 --> 19:25.917
And painted them.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.166
Oh, Noah.

19:29.125 --> 19:30.834
It's nice to see the sky.

19:37.125 --> 19:39.542
What do you say
we take a
picture?

19:39.625 --> 19:40.625
[chuckles]
What?

19:40.709 --> 19:42.041
Uh, wait.

19:42.125 --> 19:44.542
To remember today,
forever.
Come on.

20:02.166 --> 20:04.333
[chuckles]
You're,
uh..

20:04.417 --> 20:05.667
You're hard to pin down.

20:07.083 --> 20:08.125
What?

20:09.417 --> 20:11.625
You are like a wild bird.

20:11.709 --> 20:13.500
You want to flit.

20:13.583 --> 20:14.959
Fly.

20:15.041 --> 20:17.125
- I'm just an everyday gal.
- No.

20:18.458 --> 20:19.792
That's what's good.

20:30.500 --> 20:31.542
You're good.

20:33.875 --> 20:34.792
What's going on here?

20:34.875 --> 20:36.542
Birdie, were you following me?

20:36.625 --> 20:38.417
You're just throwing it
all away.

20:38.500 --> 20:39.709
Is that it?

20:39.792 --> 20:41.250
It's not what you think, Birdie.

20:41.333 --> 20:42.959
(Birdsol)
'Well, the hell
with you then, Lo.'

20:43.917 --> 20:45.417
The hell with you!

20:46.709 --> 20:49.834
[sighs]
I have to go to him.

20:49.917 --> 20:51.375
- No, Lo, wait.
- I'm sorry.

20:52.583 --> 20:53.709
I have to go.

20:58.125 --> 20:59.625
Lo and Birdie
had some history?

20:59.709 --> 21:02.333
She always said they were
just pals from work.

21:02.417 --> 21:04.250
What he told us too.

21:04.333 --> 21:07.333
[scoffs]
I don't know any pals
that act like that.

21:15.834 --> 21:18.166
Firecracker like Lo
wasn't dating
material?

21:18.250 --> 21:19.375
'Isn't that what you said,
Birdie?'

21:19.458 --> 21:20.792
Yes.

21:20.875 --> 21:23.000
So what's with you
following
her to Victory Park?

21:23.083 --> 21:24.667
Throwing a jealous fit
when you find her with
Noah?

21:24.750 --> 21:26.625
Now, that wasn't what
it seemed.

21:26.709 --> 21:28.166
Seems like you were
sick
in love with her.

21:28.250 --> 21:29.542
That's not what I was after.

21:30.875 --> 21:31.959
Then what?

21:32.041 --> 21:33.959
I needed her help
right then.

21:35.917 --> 21:37.125
With?

21:40.500 --> 21:41.750
I had a story due.

21:43.208 --> 21:44.792
And Lo had been writing them
for me.

21:46.125 --> 21:47.375
Lo wrote your articles?

21:47.458 --> 21:50.041
'When it started out,
she just edited me.'

21:50.125 --> 21:53.542
But down the line,
I'd go to her under pressure.

21:53.625 --> 21:56.083
She could whip up a story
in no time.

21:56.166 --> 21:57.625
And you couldn't?

21:59.750 --> 22:02.291
I was a five-cent reporter
in a ten-cent job.

22:05.083 --> 22:06.834
And Lo was covering for you.

22:06.917 --> 22:09.667
I had a byline, no stories.

22:09.750 --> 22:12.125
But Lo had a million stories.

22:12.208 --> 22:13.417
But no byline.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.667
I had promised McDuff
a feature on a man

22:15.750 --> 22:17.750
who survived
the worst in Europe

22:17.834 --> 22:19.709
who was rebuilding
his life here.

22:19.792 --> 22:21.083
A story on Noah.

22:21.166 --> 22:24.208
Problem was Lo
was supposed to be reporting.

22:24.291 --> 22:27.375
Not mooning around,
falling in love.

22:36.083 --> 22:38.375
You had no right acting the way
you did in the park. No right!

22:38.458 --> 22:40.291
You promised me that
front-page story this
morning.

22:40.375 --> 22:42.333
McDuff has been
breathing
down my neck all day.

22:42.417 --> 22:44.375
Birdie, you've got a brain
and ten fingers.

22:44.458 --> 22:46.000
And even if you only use
two of 'em to type

22:46.083 --> 22:47.625
nothing's stopping you
from doing your own reporting.

22:47.709 --> 22:49.750
So you backing out
of the story, is
that it?

22:49.834 --> 22:52.166
No, I-I just, I..

22:52.250 --> 22:53.792
I need more time.

22:53.875 --> 22:56.083
You need more time 'cause
you're falling for this
fella.

22:56.166 --> 22:58.333
I certainly am not.

22:58.417 --> 23:00.792
Well, I hope you know
what
you're getting yourself
into.

23:03.208 --> 23:04.750
What do you mean by that?

23:04.834 --> 23:07.250
Well, you're the one who
said
his story doesn't add up.

23:07.333 --> 23:09.709
Him escaping through
Switzerland, for
starters.

23:09.792 --> 23:11.250
People got out
however they could.

23:11.333 --> 23:13.166
The Swiss borders were
tight,
especially for Jews.

23:13.250 --> 23:16.125
You told me that. And what
about being in that camp?

23:16.208 --> 23:17.875
All the prisoners got
tattoos
on their arms.

23:17.959 --> 23:19.583
You said you were gonna check
if he had one.

23:19.667 --> 23:21.458
- I never looked.
- Why not?

23:23.250 --> 23:25.375
You're too good
a reporter for this,
Lo.

23:25.458 --> 23:27.000
Look who's talking, buster.

23:28.750 --> 23:30.166
Back when you cared
about this story

23:30.250 --> 23:32.583
'you asked me to track
someone down from his
hometown.'

23:34.542 --> 23:36.250
Remember?

23:36.333 --> 23:38.291
Well, I did.

23:38.375 --> 23:42.083
Her name is Johanna Hoffman
from Swalmen, Holland.

23:42.166 --> 23:44.667
Birdie, I need that story
on the double.

23:44.750 --> 23:46.500
You want the truth about Noah?

23:46.583 --> 23:47.709
The real truth?

23:49.208 --> 23:50.291
Ask her.

23:57.333 --> 23:59.709
(Vera)
'Did Lo ever follow-up
with this woman?'

23:59.792 --> 24:01.750
Never said.

24:01.834 --> 24:03.834
But the kind of reporter
she was

24:03.917 --> 24:05.458
I can't imagine she didn't.

24:06.709 --> 24:07.959
And then she was dead.

24:14.291 --> 24:17.000
I found this mystery woman,
Johanna Hoffman.

24:18.291 --> 24:20.750
- Oh, she still around?
- Lives up in New York.

24:20.834 --> 24:23.875
And get this.
Relocated in July of '45.

24:23.959 --> 24:25.333
About the same time Lo died.

24:25.417 --> 24:27.250
(Valens)
'Well, not about.
Exactly.'

24:27.333 --> 24:29.792
And closed her bank account,
July 17th.

24:29.875 --> 24:31.834
Paper trail in Philly
goes cold after that.

24:31.917 --> 24:35.583
So Johanna disappears
and Lo winds up dead, same day.

24:35.667 --> 24:37.875
Hmm. Lo must have gone
to find her.

24:37.959 --> 24:39.542
And something went bad.

24:39.625 --> 24:41.583
Looks like someone's
heading to New York.

24:41.667 --> 24:43.625
Uh, there's a big..

24:43.709 --> 24:46.875
[clears throat]
...poker game
at my brother's tonight,
so..

24:46.959 --> 24:49.917
It's Wednesday.
Veronica's ballet class.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.875
Don't look at me.
I'm planted.

24:53.291 --> 24:54.500
I guess that leaves me.

24:56.291 --> 24:57.667
'On my way, boss.'

25:02.000 --> 25:04.667
Uh, you're covering those
phones
like a champ, Will.

25:05.750 --> 25:08.625
Yeah, 61 years old.

25:08.709 --> 25:11.166
Getting punished
like a schoolboy.

25:11.250 --> 25:12.417
Yeah.

25:12.500 --> 25:14.583
Yeah, maybe time to go out.

25:17.417 --> 25:18.750
Maybe.

25:18.834 --> 25:20.291
No reason to keep it up.

25:20.375 --> 25:23.458
Dealing with crummy people
who lie to you all day.

25:23.542 --> 25:24.417
Dog's life.

25:24.500 --> 25:27.458
Hmm. Most guys are out by 50.

25:27.542 --> 25:29.417
Yeah.

25:29.500 --> 25:31.333
I tried taking a vacation once.

25:31.417 --> 25:33.166
Yeah?

25:33.250 --> 25:35.583
Drove to Myrtle Beach,
ten hours.

25:35.667 --> 25:38.166
Uh, beautiful golf courses,
shoreline.

25:39.583 --> 25:43.333
And I...didn't know
what to do with myself.

25:43.417 --> 25:45.500
So I drove back.

25:45.583 --> 25:47.583
I can't retire. I'd go nuts.

25:48.750 --> 25:50.500
I don't know how to not work.

25:52.208 --> 25:55.041
I used to think I only did
this
job because I was good at it.

25:55.125 --> 25:57.250
But I keep doing it.

25:59.125 --> 26:02.125
I think it's what
we actually like doing,
Will.

26:02.208 --> 26:03.834
Crummy people and all.

26:05.917 --> 26:07.125
Well, come on in here.

26:08.125 --> 26:09.625
I gotta watch the phones.

26:09.709 --> 26:10.959
Uh, you can hear
'em
from here.

26:26.750 --> 26:28.083
Happy birthday, Will.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.583
(Rush)
'Thank you for seeing me,
Johanna.'

26:45.667 --> 26:48.834
Coming all the way
from Philadelphia.

26:48.917 --> 26:50.625
It must be important.

26:50.709 --> 26:51.917
It is.

26:52.959 --> 26:55.750
It's about a murder in 1945.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.625
Who was killed?

26:58.709 --> 27:01.166
A reporter. Lorena Kinney.

27:01.250 --> 27:03.333
Lo Kinney was murdered?

27:03.417 --> 27:05.333
Pushed in front of a train.

27:05.417 --> 27:07.375
The same night
you left
Philly.

27:07.458 --> 27:09.709
[gasps]
I never knew.

27:09.792 --> 27:10.959
But you knew Lo?

27:11.041 --> 27:13.417
I met her...once.

27:16.500 --> 27:19.375
- I wish I never had.
- Why is that?

27:19.458 --> 27:22.917
Because what she told me..

27:25.125 --> 27:27.375
...haunted me..

27:27.458 --> 27:29.500
...the rest of my life.

27:36.625 --> 27:39.917
I'm writing a story about
someone from your hometown.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.375
From Swalmen?

27:41.458 --> 27:42.375
Who?

27:42.458 --> 27:43.709
Noah Pool.

27:45.125 --> 27:46.375
Noah.

27:46.458 --> 27:48.208
You know him?

27:48.291 --> 27:50.375
We lived on same
street
since childhood.

27:51.583 --> 27:52.750
Is that right?

27:52.834 --> 27:55.250
His sisters and I,
we played every day.

27:55.333 --> 27:56.667
Noah too.

27:56.750 --> 27:58.333
So strong.

27:58.417 --> 28:01.583
But also, so...gentle.

28:02.500 --> 28:04.083
Yes.

28:04.166 --> 28:05.291
He is very gentle.

28:06.333 --> 28:08.625
- Is?
- I know him.

28:08.709 --> 28:10.875
- He lives here in
Philadelphia.
- That is impossible.

28:10.959 --> 28:13.375
He'll be pleased to know someone
from Swalmen is also here.

28:13.458 --> 28:14.709
Noah is dead.

28:16.917 --> 28:17.959
What?

28:18.959 --> 28:21.125
He was killed in Auschwitz.

28:24.208 --> 28:26.250
You must be mistaken.

28:26.333 --> 28:29.917
He survived longer than
the others, painting
portraits.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.750
But when there are
no more to paint..

28:34.875 --> 28:37.041
I, uh,
I have a photo of him.

28:39.792 --> 28:41.166
'This is Noah Pool.'

28:46.458 --> 28:47.542
No.

28:50.291 --> 28:51.291
Then who?

28:54.959 --> 28:56.959
That is Anton.

28:57.041 --> 28:58.250
Anton?

29:00.375 --> 29:01.583
A guard.

29:04.542 --> 29:05.792
Are you sure?

29:08.125 --> 29:09.333
He gave me this.

29:30.834 --> 29:34.000
I left Philadelphia that day.

29:34.083 --> 29:35.583
'Knowing he was there.'

29:36.959 --> 29:39.000
I've never been back.

29:39.083 --> 29:41.125
So Lo was in love with a Nazi.

29:51.083 --> 29:52.417
(Valens)
'Sit down.'

29:54.458 --> 29:56.709
So we're looking for your uncle.

29:56.792 --> 29:58.125
Must be at his studio.

29:58.208 --> 30:00.834
- No, he cleared out.
- Where would he go?

30:01.834 --> 30:03.208
That's what I need to know.

30:07.834 --> 30:09.625
The man you thought
was your Uncle Noah..

30:11.667 --> 30:13.083
... he's someone else.

30:13.166 --> 30:14.792
[laughs]
What do you mean?

30:14.875 --> 30:16.542
His real name's Anton Bikker.

30:16.625 --> 30:18.333
And he collaborated
with the Germans.

30:19.834 --> 30:21.375
What do you think
you're saying to
me?

30:21.458 --> 30:23.959
I know how you feel about him,
and how he helped bring you up.

30:24.041 --> 30:26.583
- That's right!
- But people can lie, David.

30:29.208 --> 30:30.542
Trick you,
and be real good at it.

30:30.625 --> 30:31.875
I've known him my whole life.

30:31.959 --> 30:33.250
He's been lying that long.

30:33.333 --> 30:34.875
And now he's running,
and we gotta find him.

30:34.959 --> 30:36.000
It can't be true.

30:37.500 --> 30:39.750
Noah played with me,
taught me things.

30:39.834 --> 30:41.291
Took me to the movies.

30:44.583 --> 30:46.458
The real Noah..

30:46.542 --> 30:48.250
...died in a camp

30:48.333 --> 30:50.250
'where Anton was a guard.'

30:54.041 --> 30:55.458
We, uh..

30:58.000 --> 30:59.583
We found a woman

30:59.667 --> 31:00.834
who knew 'em both.

31:03.667 --> 31:05.208
Sixty years later.

31:06.834 --> 31:08.291
Maybe a mistake.

31:10.125 --> 31:11.917
Just can't see making
a mistake about that.

31:13.291 --> 31:14.375
Can you?

31:19.250 --> 31:22.125
Johanna Hoffman
told Lo the truth.

31:22.208 --> 31:24.250
Johanna Hoffman?

31:24.333 --> 31:25.625
Oh, you know the name?

31:27.125 --> 31:28.750
From the last time I saw Lo.

31:36.083 --> 31:37.959
You were going to meet us
in the park.

31:38.041 --> 31:40.750
Ah! Oh, my,
you're absolutely
right.

31:40.834 --> 31:43.959
Where's my head? I-I lost
track of time. Silly me.

31:44.041 --> 31:47.417
Uncle Noah said cotton candy
is your favorite.

31:47.500 --> 31:49.291
It is.

31:49.375 --> 31:51.333
Ah! Thank you.

31:56.291 --> 31:59.000
What are you working on
that you forget us?

31:59.083 --> 32:01.333
- Ah, just my column.
- Ah!

32:01.417 --> 32:03.542
More questions
about, uh, recipes?

32:03.625 --> 32:05.291
No. No, not today.

32:09.166 --> 32:10.333
Lo.

32:12.458 --> 32:13.583
What is wrong?

32:14.875 --> 32:16.834
This one's hard.

32:16.917 --> 32:18.625
Why? What is it about?

32:19.583 --> 32:20.667
A woman..

32:20.750 --> 32:22.458
...who thought
she was in love

32:22.542 --> 32:24.959
but the man she fell for
wasn't who she thought he was.

32:25.041 --> 32:26.166
If she loves him..

32:28.458 --> 32:31.667
...maybe who he is, is okay.

32:31.750 --> 32:36.000
No, this fella is smart,
and handsome, and kind.

32:36.083 --> 32:38.083
And for a while,
she thought he hung the
moon.

32:38.166 --> 32:40.375
- Did he hurt her?
- Not her.

32:40.458 --> 32:41.917
Then what is the problem?

32:43.291 --> 32:45.583
If there is love
between two people..

32:47.500 --> 32:49.208
...nothing else matters.

32:49.291 --> 32:51.709
The problem is things
he's done in the past.

32:51.792 --> 32:53.375
How can she believe them..

32:54.542 --> 32:58.291
...if for her,
he hangs the moon?

33:05.041 --> 33:07.375
Miss Kinney,
you have that
letter?

33:07.458 --> 33:08.917
Oh, yes, yes.

33:10.583 --> 33:11.709
It's here.

33:15.375 --> 33:18.500
Going to Miss Johanna Hoffman
on Pine?

33:24.709 --> 33:25.750
Yes.

33:35.500 --> 33:36.959
So Lo didn't receive that note.

33:38.208 --> 33:40.250
She wrote it to Johanna.

33:40.333 --> 33:41.709
Sent it the day she died.

33:41.792 --> 33:43.333
But Johanna had left Philly
for good.

33:45.041 --> 33:46.375
So it went back to Lo.

33:46.458 --> 33:48.291
(Valens)
'Did your, um..'

33:48.375 --> 33:49.917
...uncle..

33:50.000 --> 33:51.166
...see this letter?

33:54.917 --> 33:56.250
No.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.792
But I told him what it said.

34:04.125 --> 34:07.583
Anton stood by while
your real uncle was killed.

34:09.041 --> 34:11.959
And when Lo Kinney
found out about his lies..

34:12.041 --> 34:14.542
...he killed her too.

34:14.625 --> 34:17.500
I always wondered why
he stopped talking about
her.

34:19.125 --> 34:20.375
Where is he?

34:23.375 --> 34:24.500
Tell us..

34:25.583 --> 34:26.792
...for Noah.

34:36.583 --> 34:38.000
(Stillman)
Anton.

34:39.417 --> 34:40.625
'Anton Bikker.'

34:42.041 --> 34:43.417
Where you going, Anton?

34:45.291 --> 34:46.500
Why do you call me that?

34:46.583 --> 34:48.500
Where do you think
you can run to now?

34:48.583 --> 34:50.375
Uh, my name is Noah Pool.

34:50.458 --> 34:51.917
Noah Pool's dead.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Talk to David, my nephew.

34:54.083 --> 34:56.208
- He'll tell you.
- 'We did talk to him.'

34:56.291 --> 34:57.792
Told him how you took
his uncle's name

34:57.875 --> 34:59.417
to hide what you did
during the war.

35:00.417 --> 35:01.667
Oh, he wouldn't believe that.

35:01.750 --> 35:03.667
Then how do you think
we found you?

35:03.750 --> 35:07.500
He was disgusted by you,
just like Lo.

35:07.583 --> 35:10.709
Lo saw who I was and loved me.

35:10.792 --> 35:12.291
(Rush)
'No.'

35:12.375 --> 35:15.333
When she knew the truth,
she gave up on you.

35:15.417 --> 35:17.333
No, she was confused.

35:17.417 --> 35:18.625
Heartbroken.

35:21.041 --> 35:22.834
But she was gonna do
the right thing.

35:22.917 --> 35:24.208
(Stillman)
'Expose you.'

35:24.291 --> 35:26.458
"This will not stand."

35:29.667 --> 35:32.542
I am better than the worst
thing I ever did.

35:34.458 --> 35:37.875
I have to be
able
to go on now.

35:37.959 --> 35:39.458
To live.

35:39.542 --> 35:40.625
'I..'

35:46.959 --> 35:48.250
That's asking too much.

35:50.333 --> 35:53.542
She knew me. She should have
been able to understand.

35:53.625 --> 35:55.792
What you did,
no one can understand.

36:00.125 --> 36:02.000
If she had let herself love me..

36:05.125 --> 36:06.500
...it all would have been okay.

36:36.208 --> 36:38.834
You were expecting Johanna.

36:38.917 --> 36:40.041
Why?

36:41.792 --> 36:44.208
I wanted to show
her
a story I wrote.

36:44.291 --> 36:45.375
A story?

36:45.458 --> 36:47.083
A story about what?

36:47.166 --> 36:49.083
A Nazi..

36:49.166 --> 36:50.792
...who pretended to be a Jew.

36:52.792 --> 36:54.875
Did you know that when
the camps were finally
liberated

36:54.959 --> 36:56.500
the soldiers pushed
empty baby carriages

36:56.583 --> 36:59.375
out the front
gate,
five at a time?

36:59.458 --> 37:01.875
Why are you telling me this?

37:01.959 --> 37:05.000
People watching said it took
an hour for them all to pass
by.

37:05.083 --> 37:07.583
And you believe this woman
more than you believe me?

37:07.667 --> 37:09.959
Tell me your name.

37:10.041 --> 37:12.625
Don't play games, Lo.

37:12.709 --> 37:14.375
Tell me your name.

37:17.458 --> 37:18.750
Johanna saw the photo.

37:20.375 --> 37:21.667
The one we took
together
in the park.

37:21.750 --> 37:23.250
[sobbing]
How could you?

37:24.542 --> 37:26.333
I am not a monster.

37:26.417 --> 37:28.917
Did you kill Noah Pool,
or just watch him die?

37:29.000 --> 37:30.917
I watched him paint.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.291
Hour upon hour

37:33.375 --> 37:35.083
just the two of us.

37:35.166 --> 37:38.041
Talking about his family
in America.

37:39.417 --> 37:42.333
About a nephew, David.

37:42.417 --> 37:44.667
How he wanted to meet them
one day.

37:44.750 --> 37:48.667
And poetry,
and music, and art.

37:48.750 --> 37:50.333
And in those hours, I saw.

37:52.083 --> 37:53.250
Saw?

37:54.917 --> 37:56.083
He was a man..

37:58.333 --> 37:59.458
...better than I.

38:01.250 --> 38:02.375
Forgive me.

38:05.667 --> 38:06.792
No one can forgive you.

38:06.875 --> 38:08.208
You can.

38:08.291 --> 38:09.375
Because you loved me.

38:09.458 --> 38:12.500
- With you, I was free.
- You're wrong.

38:12.583 --> 38:15.208
That day in the park,
you understood.

38:15.291 --> 38:16.625
(Lo)
No, I didn't.
Now let me go.

38:16.709 --> 38:19.250
You know me
better than anyone.

38:19.333 --> 38:21.875
Noah Pool is dead, and
everything I know is a
lie!

38:21.959 --> 38:23.458
How we feel about each other

38:23.542 --> 38:25.041
that is not a lie.

38:25.125 --> 38:27.250
I love you,
and I know you love me.

38:27.333 --> 38:29.250
No, Anton, no.

38:29.333 --> 38:30.583
I loved Noah.

41:43.166 --> 41:44.333
