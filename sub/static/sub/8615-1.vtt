03:09.931 --> 03:13.492
26th November, 2008... Mumbai.

03:14.269 --> 03:16.362
9:54 Pm.

03:16.605 --> 03:19.733
Two unknown men stormed
Chatrapati Terminus..

03:19.808 --> 03:21.867
..and started firing bullets.

03:26.982 --> 03:29.473
For the next three
days and three nights..

03:29.551 --> 03:32.611
.. Mumbai was brought
down to its knees.

03:32.687 --> 03:35.656
10 terrorists trained
by Lashkar-e-Taiba..

03:35.724 --> 03:39.353
..executed the most dreadful
attack on lndian soil and..

03:39.394 --> 03:42.830
..turned the city of
Mumbai into a battleground.

03:54.342 --> 03:56.367
By the time this
terror attack was over..

03:56.578 --> 04:00.674
More than 160 people were dead.

04:01.483 --> 04:04.543
Many bodies had torture
marks on them as well.

04:04.619 --> 04:08.612
Seven years later... the
bullet holes have been re-plastered.

04:08.690 --> 04:11.420
The broken windows
have been replaced.

04:11.493 --> 04:14.860
But the wounds inflicted on
our heart and mind is still fresh.

04:14.930 --> 04:17.865
Because,
those who planned the attack,

04:17.933 --> 04:19.628
executed it

04:19.701 --> 04:25.640
and attacked our pride,
are still sleeping peacefully.

04:25.807 --> 04:27.900
Beyond the grasp of lndia.

04:57.906 --> 04:59.396
Come on!

05:05.313 --> 05:06.837
What's wrong with you, Man!

05:36.311 --> 05:37.676
Oh no!

05:40.348 --> 05:41.610
Hey!

06:49.918 --> 06:51.579
What's wrong with you?

07:05.333 --> 07:06.561
Oh s***!

07:23.518 --> 07:24.507
Hands up!

07:26.254 --> 07:28.245
ln a case of violent road rage..

07:28.323 --> 07:32.384
..a man was thrown off the bridge,
into the icy waters of the river below.

07:33.528 --> 07:36.656
Strangely, police have still
not been able to locate his body.

07:37.465 --> 07:39.524
lt's yet to be seen how
that will affect the trial..

07:39.601 --> 07:41.933
..of the man arrested in
connected with the alleged killing.

07:42.003 --> 07:42.992
Thank you, Your Honor.

07:43.271 --> 07:46.866
Case no: 06CF505.

07:47.275 --> 07:50.540
State of lllinois Vs Jude Rosario

07:50.612 --> 07:51.010
Verdict.

07:51.279 --> 07:53.941
When l tell you to stop,
and turn face the table. Stop.

07:54.048 --> 07:55.948
We the jury find the defendant..

07:56.017 --> 07:58.008
Upper lip. Lower lip.

07:58.286 --> 07:59.617
Tongue up.

07:59.687 --> 08:00.745
Guilty!

08:02.724 --> 08:04.351
Turn around.

08:33.955 --> 08:35.513
Here's your Passport...

08:35.823 --> 08:36.813
Pan Card...

08:37.792 --> 08:38.986
Voter lD...

08:39.660 --> 08:41.322
And this - new thing...

08:41.462 --> 08:42.520
Aadhar Card.

08:42.964 --> 08:43.988
Cell Phone...

08:44.666 --> 08:46.463
...and money.

08:47.402 --> 08:48.391
l hope you remember everything.

08:48.469 --> 08:51.029
Get in through Chirai...
then take a bus to Lakimpur.

08:51.306 --> 08:52.671
Stay in Lakhimpur for two months.

08:52.740 --> 08:53.934
Then travel to Uri by train.

08:54.008 --> 08:55.976
Once l get there,
l need to switch on this cell phone.

08:56.044 --> 08:57.705
And get rest of my orders.

08:57.779 --> 08:58.609
And..

08:59.714 --> 09:02.205
No falling in love
with an lndian girl.

09:02.283 --> 09:03.580
Bravo, kid. Go on.

09:50.899 --> 09:51.797
Yeah, tell me.

09:53.935 --> 09:55.926
Mousa Hamid.
Resident of Quetta, Pakistan.

09:56.004 --> 09:57.266
His mother died when he was eight..

09:57.305 --> 09:58.932
..and his father died
two years later in Afghanistan.

09:59.007 --> 10:01.976
l don't want his family history...
Get to the point.

10:03.011 --> 10:04.501
During the interrogation
he divulged..

10:04.579 --> 10:07.013
..that Lashkar-e-Taiba is
planning another attack on lndia.

10:07.282 --> 10:08.772
Where?
- He doesn't know.

10:08.850 --> 10:10.408
He does...make him talk.

10:14.422 --> 10:16.014
Sir, we've already
tortured him to the limit.

10:16.424 --> 10:18.358
He would've definitely
told us if he knew.

10:18.860 --> 10:19.849
Sir.

10:22.830 --> 10:24.764
Sir, even if we manage
to avert this attack..

10:24.832 --> 10:26.356
..we won't be able
to stop the next one.

10:26.434 --> 10:27.025
Who is he?

10:27.302 --> 10:27.996
Samit Mishra.

10:28.069 --> 10:31.061
New deputation from NTRO...
l told you about him.

10:31.372 --> 10:32.862
Sir, they will attack us again.

10:33.341 --> 10:34.865
They will keep attacking
us again and again.

10:34.943 --> 10:38.071
Until they don't
fulfill their motive.

10:38.346 --> 10:39.711
Because no matter how
many times they attack us..

10:39.747 --> 10:41.374
..we never do anything.

10:41.482 --> 10:42.506
Nothing.

10:42.850 --> 10:44.477
We only stop playing cricket.

10:45.753 --> 10:47.015
Sir, l have an idea...

10:47.956 --> 10:49.514
...and this way we can
stop all the attacks.

10:59.567 --> 11:00.625
We can't do that.

11:00.702 --> 11:03.034
Sir, if America can...
why can't we?

11:05.340 --> 11:06.671
You won't find anyone
in the Government..

11:06.741 --> 11:07.730
..to approve this plan.

11:07.809 --> 11:10.334
But sir...there's no need
to tell anyone in the Government.

11:12.613 --> 11:14.046
Where did you find this crazy guy?

11:23.925 --> 11:25.324
Why not, sir?

11:25.460 --> 11:27.928
Because we're not America.

11:28.296 --> 11:30.491
Roy, do you want
to start another war?

11:30.565 --> 11:33.693
Sir...just one more attack,
and we'll be waging war anyway.

11:33.768 --> 11:37.295
You're sounding like those fools..

11:37.372 --> 11:40.705
..who keep screaming
on Facebook ''Let's go to War''.

11:40.775 --> 11:41.867
''Let's go to War.''

11:41.943 --> 11:45.743
We can't risk millions of lives
in order to avenge a few hundreds.

11:45.813 --> 11:47.644
Sir, please talk to the PM...

11:47.715 --> 11:48.943
This meeting is over.

11:50.551 --> 11:52.018
Take me back to the office.

11:56.357 --> 11:59.815
Whatever is discussed
in this office cannot be repeated...

11:59.894 --> 12:05.491
... not to your colleague, not your
father, your wife... not even your dog.

12:05.566 --> 12:06.396
Yes, sir.

12:06.467 --> 12:07.832
Am l clear?
- Yes.

12:10.038 --> 12:11.005
Let's do it.

12:13.875 --> 12:15.866
Sir, this is a suicide mission.

12:15.977 --> 12:17.638
There is no chance of
the team returning alive.

12:17.678 --> 12:18.804
There won't be a team.

12:18.846 --> 12:20.609
Exactly what l was thinking, sir.

12:21.049 --> 12:22.983
Do you have someone in your mind?

12:23.051 --> 12:24.450
We'll have to find some crazy guy,

12:25.453 --> 12:26.442
lsn't it 3 hours yet.

12:27.055 --> 12:28.022
Yes.

12:29.957 --> 12:30.821
Sir...

12:31.459 --> 12:32.517
This is '97 batch.

12:32.693 --> 12:34.354
He lives with his parents.

12:34.629 --> 12:35.459
No, no.

12:35.530 --> 12:37.464
You didn't send me files
of the Northern region.

12:40.034 --> 12:42.400
No! - l sent a request
for army personnel as well.

12:42.470 --> 12:43.402
You didn't send those either.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.939
Won't do. - Please hurry up,
you're taking too long.

12:49.944 --> 12:50.876
Too high-profile.

12:50.945 --> 12:52.776
Will attract unnecessary attention.

12:52.847 --> 12:54.872
How many times do l
have to remind you? - No!

12:54.916 --> 12:57.885
Send me those classified
files as soon as possible.

12:57.952 --> 12:59.317
Satyajit Bagga.

12:59.420 --> 13:02.617
BSF Officers.
- l should get everything by tomorrow.

13:02.690 --> 13:04.920
Won't do.
- l've these 3-4 options.

13:04.992 --> 13:06.016
He's too old!

13:06.294 --> 13:08.387
lt's been too long.
Did we come too far?

13:08.463 --> 13:09.361
lt's somewhere around here.

13:09.430 --> 13:11.762
Address does not exist.
You've left all the pages blank.

13:11.833 --> 13:12.663
What do l do with these?

13:12.733 --> 13:14.257
You're not doing your job,
please pay attention.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.563
Too old, won't do.

13:16.504 --> 13:18.938
Sir, he has no passport, no
driving license... no ration card.

13:19.006 --> 13:21.406
He isn't even on Facebook...
or Twitter.

13:21.509 --> 13:22.976
Sir, on paper he doesn't exist.

13:23.044 --> 13:24.602
Just like Phantom.

13:25.513 --> 13:26.411
Who is he?

13:26.914 --> 13:28.575
Sir, Phantom?

13:29.050 --> 13:30.415
Him?

13:30.651 --> 13:34.747
Sir, there's one piece of
news about him on the internet.

13:34.822 --> 13:36.790
lt's quite old,
and without a photograph.

13:36.858 --> 13:39.554
Sir...except for this small problem,
he's the perfect man.

13:39.660 --> 13:40.649
Small problem?

13:40.728 --> 13:41.922
This is a big problem.

13:42.029 --> 13:45.465
But, sir...this is what makes
him our perfect candidate.

13:45.533 --> 13:47.558
Trust me, this is our man.

13:52.073 --> 13:53.370
Daniyal Khan!

14:10.291 --> 14:11.622
But, sir, he refused.

14:11.692 --> 14:12.750
What do you mean he refused?

14:12.827 --> 14:16.024
l didn't send you two so far so that he
says no and you two come running back.

14:16.297 --> 14:17.855
Okay, sir, we'll try again.

14:19.600 --> 14:21.465
We'll pay any amount you want.

14:22.703 --> 14:24.432
What will l do with your money?

14:24.605 --> 14:26.038
l would already be dead.

14:26.474 --> 14:29.466
And l've no interest in being
the richest man in the cemetery.

14:29.577 --> 14:30.942
Please don't waste your time.

14:31.579 --> 14:33.308
l don't want your money.

14:34.348 --> 14:35.508
What about honor?

14:37.919 --> 14:40.979
You were dishonorably discharged
from the Army, Daniyal.

14:41.055 --> 14:43.853
We're giving you a chance
to earn the honor you lost.

14:44.525 --> 14:46.789
Sir, he clearly refused.

14:46.861 --> 14:47.919
What did he say?

14:50.064 --> 14:52.726
So what now, sir?
- Fine, l am coming.

14:52.800 --> 14:53.960
Okay, sir.

15:04.245 --> 15:06.440
Whose foolish idea is this?

15:10.685 --> 15:14.746
lf l say...give me 10 illiterate,
street kids..

15:14.822 --> 15:17.620
..and l can create havoc in one
of the biggest cities in the world.

15:17.692 --> 15:19.353
You would've
called that foolish too.

15:19.427 --> 15:20.394
Right?

15:20.595 --> 15:21.926
You certainly would, sir,

15:21.996 --> 15:23.896
But they did it.

15:24.699 --> 15:27.634
And if those 10 illiterate
boys can do it, then why can't we?

15:28.336 --> 15:31.567
They were ignorant, l am not!

15:38.879 --> 15:40.870
Your father, Col. Usmaan Khan.

15:41.682 --> 15:44.412
How long has it been
since you two last talked?

15:44.952 --> 15:50.288
lmagine how happy he'll be
to see you in the lndian Army again.

15:51.726 --> 15:54.559
lf you do this job, l promise..

15:55.529 --> 15:59.829
..you'll be honorably re-appointed
on the same post in the Army.

16:10.411 --> 16:15.474
''Your shoulder sways,
My chest sways,''

16:15.549 --> 16:20.452
'' How will these broken hearted,
Carry the burden of my faith?''

16:20.521 --> 16:23.319
''My infidelity sways,
My loyalty sways.''

16:23.391 --> 16:25.825
'' Your slave sways''

16:25.893 --> 16:30.296
''My lord sways''

16:40.474 --> 16:49.712
''l have smiled And broken myself into
a million pieces, For you my lord.''

16:50.651 --> 16:57.420
''l have scrubbed,
And coloured myself, ln your hue.''

16:57.558 --> 16:58.422
Hello.

17:00.061 --> 17:01.028
Hello, papa.

17:01.295 --> 17:10.567
''You are in the stars, ln the earth,
ln every direction, My lord.''

17:11.539 --> 17:20.607
''l surrender, My conscience,
l come home to you.''

17:26.252 --> 17:27.720
They will keep killing our people.

17:28.321 --> 17:29.016
And the day isn't far..

17:29.256 --> 17:30.416
..when both our
countries will go to war.

17:30.558 --> 17:33.026
What you're trying to do,
will certainly lead to a war.

17:33.361 --> 17:34.259
lt won't.

17:34.795 --> 17:36.763
lf their deaths look like accident.

17:36.897 --> 17:38.023
They are not fools.

17:38.599 --> 17:40.965
They will soon know
that we're behind this.

17:41.035 --> 17:43.526
l want them to know
that we're behind this.

17:44.372 --> 17:47.307
But they won't have
any proof to accuse us.

17:47.975 --> 17:50.273
For the world, it will be accidents.

17:50.511 --> 17:53.503
Look, Daniyal, we're not
attacking the people of Pakistan.

17:53.748 --> 17:55.943
We just want to
finish the terrorists.

17:55.983 --> 17:59.510
ln the last 10 years, more than
50,000 Pakistanis have also died..

17:59.587 --> 18:01.054
..in this kind of violence.

18:01.489 --> 18:03.753
We must avenge 26/11 .

18:03.924 --> 18:07.860
And once Lashkar knows
the consequences of attacking us.

18:08.262 --> 18:10.000
They will think twice
before attacking us again.

18:10.000 --> 18:10.696
You're Watching 123Movies.to
They will think twice
before attacking us again.

18:10.696 --> 18:11.932
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:11.932 --> 18:13.297
But why me?
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:13.297 --> 18:13.367
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:13.367 --> 18:14.595
l'll be honest with you, Daniyal.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:14.595 --> 18:14.702
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:14.702 --> 18:16.499
For you world you've vanished.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:16.499 --> 18:16.570
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:16.570 --> 18:19.767
And if you go somewhere for
2-3 months, no one will notice.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:19.767 --> 18:19.974
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:19.974 --> 18:22.000
And if l don't return, it won't
make a difference to anyone, right?
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:22.000 --> 18:23.603
And if l don't return, it won't
make a difference to anyone, right?

18:24.712 --> 18:26.771
We both know this
is a difficult job.

18:26.847 --> 18:29.281
And you won't get a medal for this..

18:29.350 --> 18:31.443
..nor will your picture
appear on the front page.

18:31.652 --> 18:34.644
Because no one will
know what you did.

18:35.523 --> 18:38.617
Because this mission never existed.

18:41.262 --> 18:41.990
Passport...

18:42.396 --> 18:43.328
Tickets...

18:43.564 --> 18:44.462
Cell-phone.

18:44.532 --> 18:45.965
Call only from this phone.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.901
This call will get re-routed from
a third country and then come to us.

18:48.969 --> 18:50.800
Actually, don't call us at all.

18:51.305 --> 18:52.795
Because we don't know you.

18:57.411 --> 18:58.309
Cash...

18:58.379 --> 18:58.902
Cards...

18:58.979 --> 19:00.003
Locker key.

19:00.614 --> 19:02.582
And a ticket for tomorrow's match.

19:02.650 --> 19:04.311
Nawaz will meet you there.

19:29.577 --> 19:30.976
There are 30,000 people here.

19:31.445 --> 19:34.903
lf he's here,
we've only 2 days to find him.

19:34.982 --> 19:36.472
Are you Nawaz?

19:39.687 --> 19:41.951
10% seats are in smoking area.

19:42.323 --> 19:44.257
And he's a chain smoker.

19:44.525 --> 19:46.425
So chances are he'll be here.

19:48.996 --> 19:51.021
Why do you want to identify him?

19:51.432 --> 19:52.660
RAW's making a new file..

19:52.733 --> 19:54.701
..of the people involved
in Mumbai attacks.

19:54.768 --> 19:57.032
And as you know, there's
just one existing photo of this guy.

19:57.371 --> 19:58.599
And that too is very old.

20:08.482 --> 20:09.574
ls that him?

20:16.857 --> 20:17.789
No!

20:19.059 --> 20:22.586
Do you recognize him properly?
- No one does.

20:22.663 --> 20:23.960
l saw him just once.

20:24.465 --> 20:26.763
And after that he underwent
plastic surgery.

20:28.502 --> 20:29.867
So who are we looking for?

20:31.038 --> 20:32.471
Don't worry.

20:32.806 --> 20:34.535
According to the
lntelligence reports..

20:34.608 --> 20:35.973
..his face hasn't changed much.

20:43.617 --> 20:44.083
Wait!

20:44.351 --> 20:45.318
Stop! Stop! Stop!

20:45.419 --> 20:46.647
What happened?

20:46.687 --> 20:48.917
What happened?
- He must be somewhere around?

20:49.023 --> 20:51.321
He always breaks the filter
of his cigarette before smoking it.

20:51.392 --> 20:52.518
What are you doing?

20:52.593 --> 20:54.322
Can you get off the ground please?

20:54.395 --> 20:56.659
There must be similar
filters in his vacuum cleaner.

20:56.730 --> 20:57.492
What...

20:57.565 --> 20:59.965
l just saw one.
- Guys, l've got a job to do.

21:02.970 --> 21:03.937
What...

21:13.013 --> 21:14.640
What do you do in London?

21:15.482 --> 21:16.779
Can we stick to business?

21:23.524 --> 21:26.288
l am a security consultant,
for Dark Water.

21:26.493 --> 21:27.482
lt's a private company..

21:27.661 --> 21:31.358
..that provides supplies, security and
weapon's training in high risk zones.

21:32.967 --> 21:33.934
To whom?

21:34.001 --> 21:35.798
Those who can afford us.

21:36.870 --> 21:38.667
What's your connection with RAW?

21:41.976 --> 21:43.739
Why are you helping me?

21:44.645 --> 21:46.044
10,000 Pounds.

21:47.314 --> 21:49.748
l identify him,
l get the money.

21:50.317 --> 21:51.648
10,000 Pounds?

21:52.353 --> 21:53.843
You can buy me a drink then.

22:35.729 --> 22:36.718
l think that's him.

23:06.393 --> 23:07.360
You look that way.

23:32.486 --> 23:33.510
Excuse me.

23:48.702 --> 23:49.669
Hello.

23:51.338 --> 23:54.603
Hello.

24:00.581 --> 24:02.845
Hello. Hello.

24:04.451 --> 24:06.544
This is a trial for our people.

24:06.620 --> 24:09.521
l'm deeply grateful for your help.

24:18.699 --> 24:19.666
lt's him.

24:19.733 --> 24:21.997
But you didn't get
a good look at him yet.

24:22.436 --> 24:24.631
But...his voice.

24:25.372 --> 24:28.000
His style of greeting...
it's exactly the same.

24:30.577 --> 24:32.977
'Only one of our agent's
has seen this man.'

24:33.046 --> 24:33.978
'Nawaz Mistry.'

24:34.047 --> 24:36.607
'Back then she was working
for Medicine lnternational.

24:36.683 --> 24:38.674
'75,000 people died and
millions were injured..'

24:38.752 --> 24:43.348
'..in the 2005 earthquake
in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir.'

24:43.423 --> 24:46.324
'Many medical-aid workers from all
over the world were going there..'

24:46.393 --> 24:49.487
'..because Pakistan government
were issuing immediate visas.'

24:49.563 --> 24:50.996
'Nawaz was there too.'

24:51.365 --> 24:52.798
'This is the only photo we have.'

24:52.866 --> 24:54.663
'.which was on his
visa application form..'

24:54.735 --> 24:57.363
'..when he came to lndia
posing as a cricket fan'.

24:57.437 --> 25:00.600
'But after that he changed
his face... Plastic surgery.'

25:04.578 --> 25:07.445
We'll need to confirm it's him.

25:15.656 --> 25:16.918
Okay, you follow him.

25:17.024 --> 25:19.288
lf he comes back, call me.

25:19.359 --> 25:21.520
Where are you going?
- l've to be sure it's him.

25:21.829 --> 25:22.659
But..

27:51.378 --> 27:52.367
Sajid Mir.

27:52.446 --> 27:54.038
Lashkar's top military trainer.

27:54.414 --> 27:57.679
Sajid Majid,
Sajid Bill, Uncle Bill, Abu Bara..

27:57.751 --> 27:58.877
..they are all his aliases.

27:58.952 --> 28:00.317
He's got 26 passports.

28:00.420 --> 28:03.685
He trained all the terrorists
of the 26/11 attack.

28:03.757 --> 28:05.452
Planned all the operations.

28:05.525 --> 28:08.756
And also gave instructions
to the terrorists from Karachi...

28:08.829 --> 28:10.820
..while watching everything
on our news channels.

28:10.897 --> 28:12.888
''Make him stand on the
other side of the door.''

28:13.567 --> 28:15.558
''The bullet should
pierce his head.''

28:15.736 --> 28:16.668
''Now shoot.''

28:16.803 --> 28:18.464
''Just do as l say.''

28:27.681 --> 28:29.546
What happened?
- He's coming back.

28:32.886 --> 28:34.444
Did you figure out if it is him?

28:40.327 --> 28:41.385
Hello?

28:41.995 --> 28:42.791
Hello?

28:42.863 --> 28:43.693
No!

28:43.930 --> 28:45.488
You'll have to get
closer and confirm.

28:45.565 --> 28:46.497
Are you crazy?

28:46.566 --> 28:47.760
l 'm saying l am pretty sure.

28:47.834 --> 28:49.631
Are you 100% sure?
-Yes, almost.

28:49.703 --> 28:52.035
We're not paying you 10,000
Pounds to be ''Almost Sure''.

28:52.305 --> 28:53.795
I need you to be 100% sure,

28:53.874 --> 28:55.705
What do you want to do?
- Ask him for a lighter.

28:55.876 --> 28:57.605
You can see his face closer.
- S****!

28:58.912 --> 29:01.710
Excuse me. Excuse me.

29:01.882 --> 29:02.814
Excuse me.

29:05.352 --> 29:06.376
Can l have a light?

29:18.465 --> 29:19.489
Thanks.

29:42.589 --> 29:43.988
Yes.
- That man and kid.

29:44.257 --> 29:44.985
Who are you talking about?

29:45.258 --> 29:46.520
They just stepped out
of the green Volkswagen.

29:46.593 --> 29:47.582
What are you talking about?

29:47.661 --> 29:48.821
They just went inside
the building with Mir.

29:48.895 --> 29:50.362
Get them out. Now!

29:50.430 --> 29:51.954
Why?
- Their lives are in danger.

29:52.032 --> 29:54.398
Get the old man and
his daughter out now.

30:02.576 --> 30:04.703
Excuse me...sir?

30:05.011 --> 30:06.603
ls that green Volkswagen yours?

30:06.680 --> 30:08.045
Yes. Why?

30:08.648 --> 30:10.548
The car's alarm just went off.

30:10.784 --> 30:11.808
Alarm?

30:11.918 --> 30:13.010
Come quickly.

30:20.293 --> 30:20.952
Where are they?

30:21.027 --> 30:22.688
What the hell is happening?
- Where are those two?

30:22.796 --> 30:24.320
They must be on their way down.

31:39.573 --> 31:41.302
What they hell was that?

31:41.474 --> 31:43.442
Your plan was always to kill him.

31:43.643 --> 31:46.373
You knew he was Sajid as soon as
he entered his apartment.

31:46.446 --> 31:48.471
So why did you tell
me to ask him for a light?

31:48.648 --> 31:51.344
When a chain-smoker
sees someone smoking..

31:51.418 --> 31:53.477
..he feels the urge to
smoke a cigarette himself.

31:53.753 --> 31:55.983
And l wanted him to enter
his apartment with a lit cigarette.

31:56.056 --> 31:58.820
My job was to identify him.

31:58.925 --> 32:00.825
Why did you involve
me in his murder?

32:00.894 --> 32:01.883
Murder?

32:01.962 --> 32:03.987
Do you know how many
people he has killed?

32:04.564 --> 32:05.826
We've been looking
for him since 6 years.

32:05.932 --> 32:08.492
l had just one chance to kill him,
and l couldn't lose it..

32:08.568 --> 32:09.865
..no matter what the cost.

32:09.936 --> 32:11.597
Not at my cost.

32:12.439 --> 32:14.532
This is not the way l work!

32:26.286 --> 32:26.843
Sir!

32:27.988 --> 32:31.651
The massive explosion that ripped
through the apartment block behind me..

32:31.725 --> 32:33.716
..reportedly killed two people.

32:33.860 --> 32:37.523
London Police say that the
explosion was caused by a gas leak.

32:37.597 --> 32:39.997
According to the local counselor,
one of the men..

32:40.066 --> 32:43.365
..was a Pakistani businessman
called Abid Ansari.

32:43.436 --> 32:47.338
Other unconfirmed sources
say...he was also called Abu Bara.

32:47.607 --> 32:50.872
Residents of this area
are shocked by this incident.

32:50.944 --> 32:53.606
Some of the people we spoke
with say that Mr. Ansari..

32:53.680 --> 32:55.671
..was rarely ever seen by them.

33:04.624 --> 33:07.821
Case no: 06CF505.

33:07.994 --> 33:10.462
State of lllinois Vs Jude Rosario.

33:11.898 --> 33:16.494
We the jury find the defendant
guilty of second degree murder..

33:16.569 --> 33:18.002
..of Mathew Brody.

33:48.368 --> 33:49.858
David Coleman Headley.

33:50.070 --> 33:51.503
Lashkar's most important man...

33:51.571 --> 33:53.334
..responsible for planning
the attacks on Mumbai.

33:53.473 --> 33:55.304
Mother's American
and Father's Pakistani.

33:55.375 --> 33:56.899
Birth name...Dawood Gilani.

33:57.043 --> 34:00.979
But in 2006 he changed his
name to David Coleman Headley.

34:01.448 --> 34:03.382
And made a new American Passport.

34:04.484 --> 34:05.815
Because of this western name..

34:05.885 --> 34:07.546
..it was easier for
him to come to lndia.

34:08.355 --> 34:09.652
He understands
Hindi/Urdu really well.

34:09.755 --> 34:12.589
But he told people
that he's an American.

34:12.891 --> 34:14.792
Headley searched for
the targets in lndia.

34:14.860 --> 34:17.762
Gathered GPS coordinates...
and made contacts.

34:17.864 --> 34:20.297
After each trip,
he travelled to Pakistan..

34:20.367 --> 34:22.358
..and showed his videos to Lashkar.

34:22.534 --> 34:25.629
Places where the terrorists
could get in easily..

34:25.705 --> 34:28.936
..attack and return when required.

34:29.809 --> 34:32.437
ln 2009 Headley was
apprehended at Chicago airport.

34:32.545 --> 34:35.514
But America refused
to hand him over to lndia.

34:35.915 --> 34:38.577
Now he's serving a 35
year sentence in Chicago jail.

34:52.031 --> 34:53.328
Hello.

34:55.902 --> 35:00.635
That guard told me
that... you're also an lndian.

35:03.476 --> 35:04.773
Jivesh.

35:12.719 --> 35:15.244
How did you get here?

35:15.822 --> 35:18.518
l mean...what did you do?

35:19.526 --> 35:20.584
Murder.

35:30.570 --> 35:32.037
You know who he is, right?

35:33.406 --> 35:35.306
Bloody rascal.

35:35.375 --> 35:36.672
Scoundrel!

35:37.544 --> 35:39.444
l feel like...

35:41.381 --> 35:43.315
...ripping out his heart.

35:49.756 --> 35:51.621
Finish your breakfast quickly.

35:51.925 --> 35:56.294
They'll be allotting us
our entire week's duty today.

35:58.798 --> 36:00.959
How much do they
pay for working here?

36:01.468 --> 36:03.834
Depends on the job.

36:03.903 --> 36:06.371
What do they pay for the most?

36:32.799 --> 36:33.891
All clear.

36:56.990 --> 36:58.287

What are you in for?

37:47.307 --> 37:48.399
All clear!

38:12.265 --> 38:14.756
He's got cat-like eyes.

38:15.368 --> 38:16.665
Every time l see him,

38:17.236 --> 38:22.299
it makes my blood
pressure soar...with anger.

38:22.542 --> 38:25.943
Thank God...they're

38:41.260 --> 38:43.353
Hello.
- Hey, baby.

38:44.897 --> 38:47.297
Jude speaking.

38:47.367 --> 38:49.699

So sorry.

38:50.837 --> 38:52.668

Sign here.

40:05.912 --> 40:08.540
Family sent you money?

40:10.316 --> 40:11.715
Great.

40:13.920 --> 40:15.387
Great.

40:19.992 --> 40:20.981
Thank you.

40:42.749 --> 40:44.444
lnmates, step out.

40:44.884 --> 40:45.908
Arms up.

40:48.788 --> 40:49.914
Back to the wall.

40:50.890 --> 40:51.914
Arms up.

41:02.935 --> 41:04.926
Did you purchase
this in the Commissary?

41:05.037 --> 41:05.765
Yes.

41:05.838 --> 41:06.896
Where's the receipt?

41:14.814 --> 41:15.838
''What's the plan?''

41:15.882 --> 41:16.871
''Succinylcholine.''

41:16.949 --> 41:18.041
''Succi... What?''

41:18.317 --> 41:19.511
''Succinylcholine.''

41:19.585 --> 41:22.281
''A quick acting, de-polarizing
paralytic muscle relaxant.''

41:22.355 --> 41:23.481
''lt's a perfect poison.''

41:23.556 --> 41:26.753
''lt leaves no trace,
and even a small dose is enough.''

41:27.293 --> 41:28.590
''No need to swallow it either.''

41:28.694 --> 41:30.855
''lt starts acting as soon as it
comes in contact with the tounge.''

41:33.866 --> 41:37.996
''Mossad used this to assassinate
Mehmood Al Mamooh in Dubai.''

41:38.638 --> 41:40.037
''They caught him on CCTV camera..''

41:40.306 --> 41:42.570
''..otherwise no one would've
ever known how he died.''

42:03.262 --> 42:06.663
All the muscles of the body
lockup within a minute.

42:07.033 --> 42:09.263
You can't breathe
for almost 5 minutes.

42:13.840 --> 42:15.808
Without oxygen, a man dies.

42:36.662 --> 42:37.560
All clear.

43:54.573 --> 43:55.597
Guys!

43:56.575 --> 43:57.599
Headley's dead!

44:02.315 --> 44:02.906
Heart attack.

44:10.389 --> 44:13.654
According to our sources,
David Headley died yesterday..

44:13.726 --> 44:14.954
..in Chicago prison.

44:15.895 --> 44:19.456
The Chicago Police haven't
issued any official statement yet.

44:25.905 --> 44:27.372
86...

44:28.708 --> 44:29.868
You have a visitor.

44:37.316 --> 44:38.544
l've good news.

44:38.718 --> 44:40.049
They found Mathew Brody.

44:40.553 --> 44:41.542
They found him!

44:41.821 --> 44:44.381
He swam out of the river
before the rescue team arrived.

44:44.724 --> 44:45.782
So now what?

44:46.625 --> 44:47.819
You're a free man.

44:47.893 --> 44:49.451
We'll get you out
of here by tomorrow.

45:43.516 --> 45:45.040
Hello, Pakistan High
Commission, London.

45:45.317 --> 45:46.011
How may l help you?

45:46.285 --> 45:47.809
My name's Daniyal Khan.

45:47.987 --> 45:49.682
l would like to speak
to the High Commissioner.

45:49.855 --> 45:51.550
May l know what this is about?

45:51.657 --> 45:53.716
l've information about
Sajid Mir's death.

45:54.894 --> 45:56.452
This is High Commissioner
Sheriyar Baig.

45:56.529 --> 45:58.656
Sajid Mir's death
wasn't an accident.

45:59.632 --> 46:01.293
He was assassinated by RAW.

46:09.442 --> 46:10.704
l wanted to thank you.

46:10.810 --> 46:12.368
l don't need your thanks.

46:12.511 --> 46:14.672
l just need to know what
the hell you got me into.

46:14.947 --> 46:15.811
What do you want?

46:15.881 --> 46:18.748
l want to avenge my dishonorable
discharge from the lndian Army.

46:19.385 --> 46:20.579
Why are you telling me all this?

46:20.719 --> 46:22.914
l want to meet Lashkar's
leader in Pakistan.

46:22.988 --> 46:26.617
lf you tell them that
lndia assassinated Sajid Mir..

46:26.892 --> 46:29.952
..then what's the point of setting
everything up to look like an accident?

46:30.396 --> 46:31.954
He'll show your
evidence to the world..

46:32.031 --> 46:34.363
..and make a case against lndia.

46:34.567 --> 46:37.832
For the last 6 years Pakistan
has been telling the world..

46:37.870 --> 46:39.963
..that there's no
such man as Sajid Mir.

46:40.473 --> 46:43.408
How can you kill someone
who doesn't exist?

46:44.477 --> 46:45.671
And what did the
High Commissioner say?

46:45.744 --> 46:46.904
Bloody fool!

46:46.979 --> 46:49.345
You think l am Lashkar's servant.

46:49.415 --> 46:50.939
l am the High
Commissioner of Pakistan..

46:51.016 --> 46:52.643
..not a representative of Lashkar.

46:52.785 --> 46:54.377
Don't ever call back again.

47:07.600 --> 47:09.227
Why did you quit RAW?

47:09.301 --> 47:11.701
What is the point
of this conversation?

47:12.238 --> 47:13.398
l have to go.

47:14.473 --> 47:16.304
Where are you going?
- Beirut.

47:16.709 --> 47:17.903
Why Beirut?

47:18.644 --> 47:20.737
You ask too many questions.

47:21.380 --> 47:24.406
Usually we charge
for such information,

47:25.451 --> 47:28.386
Well... l can pay for your coffee.

47:29.922 --> 47:33.289
We're providing security and materials
to the Syrian refugee camps.

47:33.359 --> 47:34.383
Syria?

47:34.527 --> 47:37.621
Even Lashkar's fighters
are involved in that battle..

47:37.730 --> 47:40.893
That's too much information
for a cup of coffee.

47:46.972 --> 47:48.303
Good luck.

47:56.348 --> 47:58.509
Hello, Pakistan High Commission,
how may l help you?

47:58.584 --> 48:01.985
This is Daniyal Khan speaking.
- Okay. Please hold.

48:02.988 --> 48:05.684
Sir, it's that Daniyal
Khan calling again.

48:05.758 --> 48:07.350
Tell him l am not here.

48:07.459 --> 48:09.359
Sorry, sir, the High Commissioner
is not here at the moment.

48:09.428 --> 48:10.224
Thank you.

48:10.296 --> 48:11.285
Do you know when?

48:19.438 --> 48:20.905
Hello.
- Daniyal Khan.

48:20.973 --> 48:23.339
Yes. - What do you
know about Sajid Mir.

48:23.409 --> 48:25.240
Sajid's death wasn't an accident.

48:25.411 --> 48:26.503
He was assassinated.

48:26.579 --> 48:28.479
How do you know Sajid Mir's dead?

48:28.547 --> 48:32.574
Fine, then Abid Ansari...or
Sajid Majid, or Abu Bara.

48:32.651 --> 48:34.016
One of them is definitely dead.

48:34.286 --> 48:36.948
l've proof that the
man who died in that room..

48:37.256 --> 48:38.814
..used all these aliases.

48:39.358 --> 48:40.290
Do you want to see?

48:40.326 --> 48:41.691
Why are you calling us from London?

48:41.961 --> 48:44.589
Either you're a fool...
or you think l am one.

48:44.930 --> 48:49.026
Why would an ex-lndian Army
officer contact you from lndia.

48:51.637 --> 48:54.299
Give us your number.
- No, l will contact you.

48:54.373 --> 48:55.670
Give me your number.

48:56.875 --> 48:57.899
Write it down.

49:02.681 --> 49:04.205
What do you think, Firoz?

49:04.984 --> 49:07.817
Sir, l don't believe
this man at all.

49:07.886 --> 49:10.480
But how did he know..

49:10.522 --> 49:13.457
..that the person who died
in the gas explosion was Sajid Mir?

49:13.525 --> 49:14.992
What proof can he have?

49:15.261 --> 49:17.388
l think this is some
kind of a trick, Haider sir.

49:17.963 --> 49:21.694
But if he's telling the truth,
he can be really useful to us.

49:21.967 --> 49:23.958
Find out more about him.

49:26.438 --> 49:27.598
What do you want from us?

49:27.673 --> 49:28.867
l want to come to Pakistan..

49:28.974 --> 49:32.705
..and meet Lashkar's chief
Haaris Saaed or Sabauddin Umavi.

49:32.778 --> 49:34.769
You can't come to Pakistan.

49:38.250 --> 49:39.615
We have agents in London.

49:39.685 --> 49:41.312
Go see them and
show them your proof.

49:41.387 --> 49:42.945
l don't want to meet your agents..

49:43.255 --> 49:44.722
.. l want to meet
the leader of Lashkar.

49:47.393 --> 49:49.327
Can you come to Afghanistan?
- No.

49:49.828 --> 49:51.386
There are too many lndian agents.

49:51.497 --> 49:52.828
They can spot me.

49:54.300 --> 49:55.892
Then there's nothing we can do.

49:57.770 --> 49:58.759
There is one place.

49:59.638 --> 50:00.605
Syria.

50:01.307 --> 50:02.865
Lashkar's men are
stationed there too.

50:07.846 --> 50:09.438
Call back in five minutes.

50:12.384 --> 50:14.318
Sir, Syria?
- That's the right place.

50:14.453 --> 50:16.614
That place is filled with
Lashkar's people as well as ours.

50:16.755 --> 50:18.689
lf he's telling the truth,
we'll bring him to Pakistan.

50:18.757 --> 50:20.850
lf he's lying,
he'll be another dead body.

50:21.060 --> 50:22.652
No one will notice in Syria.

50:27.933 --> 50:29.059
Get to Syria.

50:29.568 --> 50:31.763
lf you're smart, you can
rendezvous with Lashkar's people.

50:31.804 --> 50:32.668
But..

51:05.371 --> 51:06.360
Hello.

51:07.840 --> 51:08.738
What?

51:12.711 --> 51:13.609
l need to get to Syria.

51:13.712 --> 51:14.804
Are you crazy?

51:15.381 --> 51:16.643
lt's a warzone.

51:16.749 --> 51:18.478
l want to meet with
Lashkar's people.

51:18.550 --> 51:19.574
Then go.

51:19.785 --> 51:22.583
Every self styled Jihadi is going
to Syria to fight.

51:22.788 --> 51:24.278
You can join them too.

51:24.690 --> 51:27.284
No one's asking for
a visa or passport.

51:27.393 --> 51:30.624
But only you know where
l can find Lashkar's people.

51:30.929 --> 51:33.898
lf l try to find them myself,
it will take longer.

51:34.066 --> 51:35.431
l don't have time.

51:35.567 --> 51:37.694
Daniyal, l don't know
where Lashkar's people are.

51:37.770 --> 51:40.295
We're just providing refugee camps....
- Come on, Nawaz.

51:40.873 --> 51:43.637
We all know what Dark
Water does in reality.

51:44.643 --> 51:46.577
Refugee camps are just a front.

51:46.779 --> 51:52.046
America supplies weapons to Jihadis
in Syria through Dark Water.

51:52.751 --> 51:54.946
And Lashkar is part
of those rebel forces too.

51:56.054 --> 51:58.682
So you must know where they are.

52:05.330 --> 52:07.764
Why do you always trouble me?

52:27.653 --> 52:29.678
Hello.

52:41.667 --> 52:45.068
Seems like lSl has already
informed Lashkar about you.

53:22.641 --> 53:23.801
Thank you.

53:41.527 --> 53:42.551
Hello.

53:54.907 --> 53:57.000
We know you're a RAW agent.

53:58.510 --> 53:59.909
l am not a RAW agent.

54:06.385 --> 54:08.285
He hasn't spoken yet, Qureshi sir.

54:08.387 --> 54:09.945
This is what he gave us.

54:15.661 --> 54:17.288
Where did you get these?

54:17.362 --> 54:18.727
l have my sources.

54:19.398 --> 54:23.459
lf l can get these,
then imagine what else l can get.

54:26.572 --> 54:27.766
Where did you get them?

54:27.839 --> 54:31.331
l just need a opportunity
to avenge my humiliation.

54:31.643 --> 54:33.338
Military facilities...

54:33.445 --> 54:34.605
Air bases.

54:35.514 --> 54:38.039
l have all the inside information.

54:44.756 --> 54:46.986
All the signal towers
are down due to the war.

54:47.559 --> 54:49.049
lt's difficult to get a network.

54:49.394 --> 54:52.795
Fine... l'll send this
once l get to Salayiddin.

54:53.532 --> 54:55.466
lf you don't take me to Pakistan..

54:55.701 --> 54:59.398
..believe me,
you will always regret it.

55:00.706 --> 55:01.968
Our chiefs in Pakistan will decide..

55:02.240 --> 55:04.504
..if we will regret this or you.

55:04.643 --> 55:07.578
Keep him here until
l don't speak with them.

55:07.646 --> 55:08.635
Sir.

55:16.755 --> 55:17.722
Alam!

55:17.889 --> 55:20.414
Follow them and let me
know where they are going.

55:27.866 --> 55:29.925
Seems like the battle
has started again.

55:31.670 --> 55:34.730
S***! Let's do this fast.

55:43.415 --> 55:44.313
Hello.

55:44.549 --> 55:46.414
Qureshi sir, what do we do with him?

55:56.028 --> 55:57.689
Get out of there quickly.

55:57.996 --> 55:59.020
Yes, sir.

55:59.865 --> 56:00.763
We're out.

56:01.299 --> 56:02.766
No, sir...it's difficult
to get out that way.

56:02.968 --> 56:04.526
l'll bring him to Salayiddin.

56:13.011 --> 56:14.308
What have you done?

56:16.014 --> 56:18.278
Daniyal,
government forces are advancing.

56:18.350 --> 56:20.011
My plan was working fine!

56:20.752 --> 56:22.242
You ruined everything.

56:22.554 --> 56:23.418
lf..

56:33.832 --> 56:35.629
Something's wrong.

56:36.268 --> 56:37.895
Let's get out of this area quickly.

56:38.704 --> 56:40.331
Come on...move.

56:56.888 --> 56:57.616
Okay.

56:58.390 --> 57:00.449
He's close-by, Take left.

57:05.864 --> 57:08.560
lf we don't find that guy,
l'm dead.

57:08.633 --> 57:10.000
And if the Syrian army catches us..

57:10.000 --> 57:10.567
You're Watching 123Movies.to
And if the Syrian army catches us..

57:10.567 --> 57:10.635
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:10.635 --> 57:12.535
..they will shoot us
thinking we're rebels.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:12.535 --> 57:12.904
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:12.904 --> 57:14.428
Then we're all dead.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:14.428 --> 57:15.340
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:15.340 --> 57:16.500
Take a right.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:16.500 --> 57:22.000
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:22.714 --> 57:23.544
Hello.

57:23.615 --> 57:25.276
Why haven't you sent the video yet?

57:35.594 --> 57:37.755
S**** Syrian Army.

57:38.630 --> 57:39.892
Hang on!

57:49.741 --> 57:51.834
Sir, all the signals
in this area are down.

57:51.910 --> 57:54.276
l am trying,
but the video isn't going through.

58:06.358 --> 58:06.983
Come on.

58:18.470 --> 58:19.368
There he is.

58:23.742 --> 58:24.936
Let's go.

58:38.990 --> 58:39.854
Hello...

58:54.573 --> 58:55.471
What's going on?

58:55.540 --> 58:57.269
Someone's firing on us, sir?
- Who?

58:57.342 --> 58:59.367
l don't know...it's hard to say.

59:06.985 --> 59:08.452
Send his video quickly.

59:08.520 --> 59:10.715
Sir, the signal's really bad...
l am not being able to send it.

59:16.695 --> 59:17.992
Get up!

59:47.292 --> 59:48.589
Sending it now.

01:00:00.772 --> 01:00:01.796
Daniyal!

01:00:13.885 --> 01:00:16.353
Find out who is Daniyal Khan.

01:00:16.888 --> 01:00:20.380
We'll have to show these rascals...
that we can play this game too.

01:01:11.276 --> 01:01:13.506
Rajan Sampat died
in a gas explosion.

01:01:13.578 --> 01:01:15.273
Exactly like the way Sajid Mir died.

01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:16.972
This can't be a coincidence.

01:01:17.482 --> 01:01:18.608
They know, sir.

01:01:18.683 --> 01:01:21.618
Sir, it's all because
of what went down in Syria.

01:01:22.954 --> 01:01:23.943
S***!

01:01:24.356 --> 01:01:26.483
''ls there a connection
between these two deaths?''

01:01:26.558 --> 01:01:27.456
''Mr. Singh?''

01:01:27.525 --> 01:01:29.015
''There's a very clear connection.''

01:01:29.294 --> 01:01:31.524
''Gas explosion for a gas explosion.''

01:01:31.696 --> 01:01:33.960
''Rajan Sampat's death
is revenge killing.''

01:01:34.032 --> 01:01:36.500
''You mean to say that
the lndian Government..''

01:01:36.568 --> 01:01:38.900
''..is behind the assassination
of the lSl agent.''

01:01:38.970 --> 01:01:39.698
Roy...

01:01:41.039 --> 01:01:43.735
...did your people kill Sajid Mir?

01:01:43.808 --> 01:01:44.968
No, sir.

01:01:45.577 --> 01:01:48.478
There's no question
of our men being involved.

01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:51.374
Sir, we don't have
permission to do all this.

01:01:51.449 --> 01:01:53.007
Of course you don't, Roy.

01:01:53.518 --> 01:01:56.453
And don't you forget that.
- Sir!

01:01:58.456 --> 01:01:58.979
Sir!

01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:01.991
The man you killed in Syria
was not on our list, Daniyal.

01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:03.522
Sir, l already told you.

01:02:03.928 --> 01:02:05.395
Things got out of control.

01:02:05.563 --> 01:02:06.621
l didn't have any other choice.

01:02:06.698 --> 01:02:08.689
That was a stupid mistake.

01:02:08.867 --> 01:02:10.664
Now they know everything about you.

01:02:10.735 --> 01:02:12.794
Before things get out of hand,
l want you to come back.

01:02:12.871 --> 01:02:14.668
Sir, he couldn't
send the video.

01:02:14.839 --> 01:02:16.431
They just heard my name.

01:02:16.541 --> 01:02:18.008
We can still..
- lt's over, Daniyal.

01:02:18.376 --> 01:02:19.809
The media is talking.

01:02:19.978 --> 01:02:21.605
The Government is
getting suspicious.

01:02:21.679 --> 01:02:23.510
We will be in serious trouble.

01:02:23.581 --> 01:02:25.344
But, sir...
- The mission is over.

01:02:25.483 --> 01:02:26.882
Come back, right now.

01:02:27.886 --> 01:02:28.910
So that's it.

01:02:29.421 --> 01:02:31.321
The main terrorists in Pakistan..

01:02:31.389 --> 01:02:35.052
..who were responsible for Mumbai
attacks will never face trial.

01:02:36.394 --> 01:02:38.828
Everything you did
until now will be a waste.

01:02:38.963 --> 01:02:40.658
lt'll mean nothing.

01:02:41.599 --> 01:02:44.534
lf you were planning to run
away at the first sight of trouble..

01:02:44.602 --> 01:02:47.366
..then why say yes..
- l am not running away, Nawaz!

01:02:49.474 --> 01:02:50.702
l am not running away!

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:11.385
There was a young
soldier in the army,

01:03:12.363 --> 01:03:13.523
Dilawar Singh.

01:03:15.934 --> 01:03:18.630
Every morning he would
salute me enthusiastically.

01:03:20.538 --> 01:03:22.028
With respect..

01:03:23.441 --> 01:03:24.601
With passion..

01:03:29.581 --> 01:03:31.845
Do you know why l agreed to
do this mission?

01:03:34.619 --> 01:03:38.817
Because l want to see the same respect
in Dilawar Singh's eyes for me.

01:03:39.791 --> 01:03:41.520
l want him to salute me again..

01:03:41.793 --> 01:03:45.524
With the same enthusiasm.
The same passion.

01:03:53.838 --> 01:03:54.805
What happened?

01:04:02.647 --> 01:04:06.378
ln the Doda Sector, we were
trying to save our Winter post.

01:04:06.551 --> 01:04:08.883
Amidst continuous shelling
for almost 72 hours.

01:04:11.890 --> 01:04:13.949
Radio.
- Radio is down, sir.

01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:15.892
Alpha...

01:04:16.261 --> 01:04:17.785
Sir...
- Alpha Tiger 1 2 3...

01:04:17.862 --> 01:04:18.886
if the reinforcements
don't arrive soon..

01:04:18.963 --> 01:04:21.022
..we won't be able to
hold them off for too long.

01:04:22.534 --> 01:04:24.297
We're just four
hours away from them.

01:04:24.769 --> 01:04:26.566
Prepare two soldiers.

01:04:31.342 --> 01:04:31.933
Sir..

01:04:32.877 --> 01:04:34.344
l'll go, sir.

01:04:34.779 --> 01:04:37.304
'None of them were
in any condition to walk.'

01:04:37.916 --> 01:04:41.317
'No one had slept or
eaten since three days.'

01:04:41.653 --> 01:04:45.555
'l left my men in the bunker,
and decided to go alone.'

01:05:24.295 --> 01:05:27.890
'When they found me,
l was far away from my bunker.'

01:05:33.972 --> 01:05:37.703
'All my men in the
bunker were dead.'

01:05:38.810 --> 01:05:40.607
'l was discharged from the army.'

01:05:40.778 --> 01:05:44.509
'For deserting my post and my men.'

01:06:00.965 --> 01:06:04.765
Daniyal, l can take us to Pakistan.

01:06:09.774 --> 01:06:10.706
Us?

01:06:12.744 --> 01:06:13.733
Us!

01:06:39.624 --> 01:06:40.784
Madam, please.

01:06:42.627 --> 01:06:43.787
This way please.

01:06:44.196 --> 01:06:45.254
Hello.

01:06:45.330 --> 01:06:46.490
Hello.

01:06:47.232 --> 01:06:48.392
Look into the camera.

01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:50.331
Arif Mirza.
- Yes.

01:06:53.138 --> 01:06:54.162
What is the purpose of your visit?

01:06:54.239 --> 01:06:56.070
l work with Medicine lnternational.

01:06:56.208 --> 01:06:58.403
lt's good to have you back in
Medicine lnternational Nawaz.

01:06:58.477 --> 01:06:59.273
Thank you so much.

01:06:59.678 --> 01:07:02.272
This is my friend,
Arif Mirza from South Africa.

01:07:02.347 --> 01:07:05.680
He's done extensive work with
NGOs in Namibia and South Africa.

01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:07.240
Can l see your lD card please?

01:07:08.353 --> 01:07:09.342
How long are you planning to stay?

01:07:09.421 --> 01:07:10.513
10 days.

01:07:12.524 --> 01:07:13.456
Thank you.

01:07:13.658 --> 01:07:14.556
Thank you.

01:07:14.826 --> 01:07:15.656
Excuse me.

01:07:16.862 --> 01:07:18.261
This way please.

01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:29.602
Firoz.
- Sir.

01:07:29.674 --> 01:07:32.507
Why is it taking so long
to gather information about one man?

01:07:32.611 --> 01:07:34.704
There's very little information
available on Daniyal Khan, sir.

01:07:34.746 --> 01:07:36.805
lt's been two weeks, and you..
- Sir.

01:07:37.215 --> 01:07:39.479
lt's true that he
was court-martialed.

01:07:39.618 --> 01:07:41.176
There are reports on the internet.

01:07:41.219 --> 01:07:44.279
Other than that we know that
his father is a retired Colonel.

01:07:44.356 --> 01:07:46.415
His parents live alone in Devlali.

01:07:47.726 --> 01:07:49.318
304 & 305!

01:07:49.394 --> 01:07:50.622
Have a pleasant stay, sir.

01:07:50.695 --> 01:07:51.662
Thank you.

01:07:51.730 --> 01:07:53.163
Call the US Embassy.

01:07:53.231 --> 01:07:54.789
l want files on every inmate..

01:07:55.066 --> 01:07:57.091
..that was in prison
when Headley died.

01:07:57.169 --> 01:07:59.228
And...ask one of our men..

01:07:59.304 --> 01:08:01.238
..to pay a visit to
Daniyal Khan's parents.

01:08:01.306 --> 01:08:02.568
l clearly said no.

01:08:02.641 --> 01:08:03.608
Yes, sir.

01:08:03.708 --> 01:08:05.642
But he still went to Pakistan.

01:08:05.710 --> 01:08:07.234
Sir, now that he's there..

01:08:07.312 --> 01:08:08.540
..we should help him.

01:08:08.613 --> 01:08:10.513
That's what l think.

01:08:11.216 --> 01:08:12.183
Who's our trusted contact in Lahore?

01:08:12.250 --> 01:08:14.775
Sir, Khalid. He runs a small eatery in
Mohalla Johar for the past three years.

01:08:14.853 --> 01:08:16.787
To keep an eye on
Haaris Saeed's movements.

01:08:16.854 --> 01:08:19.846
Ask Vinay from the consulate
to contact Daniyal.

01:08:27.365 --> 01:08:28.627
Yes.

01:08:33.438 --> 01:08:35.804
Vishal Singh,
voter lD registration officer.

01:08:36.073 --> 01:08:38.542
l need to confirm some
details for the voter lD.

01:08:40.212 --> 01:08:41.406
How many members in your family.

01:08:41.479 --> 01:08:44.448
Me, my husband...and my son.

01:08:44.515 --> 01:08:47.349
Can l see a photo
of your husband and son?

01:08:47.419 --> 01:08:48.249
Photo?

01:08:48.319 --> 01:08:49.446
Just to check.

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:50.545
Elections are around the corner.

01:08:50.622 --> 01:08:52.055
We've had many cases
of fake voter cards.

01:08:52.122 --> 01:08:54.113
Department's orders...
that's why we're insisting.

01:08:54.192 --> 01:08:55.625
Checking photos...etcetera.

01:09:11.676 --> 01:09:13.303
Daniyal Khan.

01:09:13.444 --> 01:09:14.639
Can l see his photo?

01:09:14.712 --> 01:09:16.805
l don't have a recent one,
it's a bit old.

01:09:16.848 --> 01:09:17.837
Will do.

01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:18.740
Fine.

01:09:18.850 --> 01:09:20.647
We've found his picture, sir.

01:09:20.719 --> 01:09:22.310
But he says it's a bit old.

01:09:45.243 --> 01:09:47.404
Call the US Embassy...immediately.

01:09:47.511 --> 01:09:50.572
l will pay back
every penny... l swear.

01:09:50.649 --> 01:09:52.514
You hardly earn 2000 a month.

01:09:52.651 --> 01:09:55.677
How do you plan to repay 100,000?
- l really love Aasia.

01:09:56.054 --> 01:09:58.488
Once we get married,
my luck will change as well.

01:09:58.556 --> 01:10:00.581
Normally the bride's
parents pay for the wedding.

01:10:00.659 --> 01:10:02.752
She belongs to a poor family.

01:10:03.061 --> 01:10:04.585
They can't afford to throw
a feast for the entire community.

01:10:04.663 --> 01:10:06.426
And you're a king
of some sort, right?

01:10:06.564 --> 01:10:08.759
So you won't help me?
- No.

01:10:09.567 --> 01:10:10.659
Where are you going?

01:10:10.769 --> 01:10:12.066
Who will arrange these?

01:10:12.170 --> 01:10:15.469
Make this fatso do it,
all he does is sit and eat.

01:10:15.607 --> 01:10:16.574
Yes, mister.

01:10:16.641 --> 01:10:19.166
One tea...two fritters.
- Hurry up.

01:10:21.813 --> 01:10:26.477
And...the guys were all
praises about your sweet-lumps.

01:10:27.786 --> 01:10:32.086
Yes, but its only
available in the evening.

01:10:38.530 --> 01:10:39.724
That's his home.

01:10:41.232 --> 01:10:43.200
Lashkar-e-Taiba's supreme leader.

01:10:43.335 --> 01:10:44.529
Haaris Saeed.

01:10:44.602 --> 01:10:47.628
His name's on every Most
Wanted list in the world.

01:10:47.706 --> 01:10:49.571
But he roams freely
without any fear.

01:10:49.641 --> 01:10:53.133
He's protected by Lashkar's
people armed with Kalashnikovs..

01:10:53.244 --> 01:10:54.336
..and the police too.

01:10:54.446 --> 01:10:55.743
And of course, the lSl.

01:10:56.147 --> 01:10:57.637
The American Government
has announced a reward..

01:10:57.716 --> 01:10:59.684
..of 10 million dollars on his head.

01:10:59.751 --> 01:11:01.241
But everyone knows where he lives.

01:11:01.319 --> 01:11:02.650
He's also on Twitter.

01:11:04.389 --> 01:11:07.620
And Umavi,
is he really in Rawalpindi Jail.

01:11:07.659 --> 01:11:09.650
Mister, l would rather
call it a hotel.

01:11:09.728 --> 01:11:12.162
Since the time he's been there,
he's fathered two children.

01:11:12.330 --> 01:11:14.764
Even the Pakistan government
have to show the Americans..

01:11:14.833 --> 01:11:18.064
..that we're serious
about suppressing Lashkar,

01:11:18.169 --> 01:11:19.727
So they sent him
to prison for namesake.

01:11:25.143 --> 01:11:26.667
Move it aside.

01:11:27.679 --> 01:11:30.807
Haaris Saeed is holding
a huge rally in 5 days.

01:11:31.082 --> 01:11:31.673
Daniyal.

01:11:31.783 --> 01:11:36.379
Even if we get our hands on one,
it'll be impossible get the other.

01:11:36.521 --> 01:11:39.217
The entire Pakistani police
and army will be out looking for us.

01:11:39.290 --> 01:11:40.314
Unless...

01:11:40.425 --> 01:11:43.121
lndia wants to destroy Pakistan's..

01:11:43.161 --> 01:11:46.028
..peace and serenity completely.

01:11:46.097 --> 01:11:49.430
And these conspiracies
have weakened Pakistan.

01:11:51.736 --> 01:11:55.035
And today those people sitting
in Delhi are saying..

01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:58.541
..that they've put
a price on my head.

01:11:58.810 --> 01:12:02.439
Jihad isn't about kill him or
him...or about killing every infidel.

01:12:02.547 --> 01:12:04.481
Whoever points their
weapons at us...

01:12:04.549 --> 01:12:06.540
Tries to jeopardize our freedom...

01:12:06.751 --> 01:12:08.548
Tries to harm our country...

01:12:11.156 --> 01:12:14.284
The air of terrorism
that's building up..

01:12:14.359 --> 01:12:15.724
But no...

01:12:22.267 --> 01:12:24.201
lt's just 100,000, brother.

01:12:24.369 --> 01:12:26.269
l swear l'll never
ask for anything else.

01:12:26.337 --> 01:12:28.271
Why should l lend you 100,000?

01:12:28.339 --> 01:12:30.068
Marriage is a one-time affair,
brother.

01:12:30.141 --> 01:12:32.075
Friends, relatives...the community..

01:12:33.478 --> 01:12:35.002
And 100,000 isn't too much.

01:12:35.079 --> 01:12:37.604
Food...drinks...decoration...
tables, chairs...

01:12:37.682 --> 01:12:40.242
Photos...lightings...stereo!

01:12:40.318 --> 01:12:42.252
lt all adds up to this amount.

01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:43.446
l swear.

01:12:43.521 --> 01:12:44.579
When are you getting married?

01:12:44.722 --> 01:12:46.656
As soon as he lends me the money.

01:12:46.724 --> 01:12:49.420
Mom's come down too...
from my hometown, all decked.

01:12:49.494 --> 01:12:52.725
She's waiting to see
my wedding procession.

01:12:53.031 --> 01:12:55.727
For the moment when her prince's
wedding procession comes home.

01:12:56.134 --> 01:12:57.123
l swear...

01:12:57.202 --> 01:12:59.227
You can swear all you want.

01:12:59.337 --> 01:13:00.634
l won't lend you a penny.

01:13:00.738 --> 01:13:03.434
Those Mujahiddin were
much better than him.

01:13:03.641 --> 01:13:05.336
They were recruiting
me at the training camps..

01:13:05.376 --> 01:13:06.536
..for 3000 a month.

01:13:06.578 --> 01:13:08.773
They were also giving automatic
guns and boots to wear.

01:13:09.047 --> 01:13:11.311
And they would've sacrificed
your life by now too.

01:13:11.382 --> 01:13:13.282
So what?
l would've gone to Heaven.

01:13:13.351 --> 01:13:14.613
lt would've been
better than your shop.

01:13:14.652 --> 01:13:16.449
So you're eager to go to Heaven,
are you?

01:13:19.057 --> 01:13:21.423
Umavi has an old back problem.

01:13:21.759 --> 01:13:23.056
Every week a doctor from Lahore..

01:13:23.161 --> 01:13:24.253
..goes to the jail
to give him an injection.

01:13:24.362 --> 01:13:25.659
When is the doctor visiting next?

01:13:25.730 --> 01:13:26.754
He goes every Friday.

01:13:26.831 --> 01:13:29.322
Which means his next
visit's on the 1 4th.

01:13:29.667 --> 01:13:31.760
One day before the rally.

01:13:32.203 --> 01:13:35.195
Can we approach the doctor?
- Don't even think about it.

01:13:35.306 --> 01:13:36.637
He's been with him for 20 years.

01:13:36.708 --> 01:13:39.108
His loyalty lies with Lashkar.

01:13:39.177 --> 01:13:41.270
You cannot break him.
Not with force nor money.

01:13:41.613 --> 01:13:44.343
But yes...the doctor
has an old nurse.

01:13:45.283 --> 01:13:46.341
Amina Bi.

01:13:46.417 --> 01:13:48.681
Sir! Sir! Sir!

01:13:49.387 --> 01:13:51.355
The Americans have sent
the Chicago inmate files.

01:13:51.422 --> 01:13:54.016
Great. l want printouts
of every file.

01:14:04.102 --> 01:14:06.536
Greetings, mister.
- Greetings.

01:14:06.604 --> 01:14:08.697
There was a function at school.

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:10.234
l need to rent some stuff.

01:14:10.308 --> 01:14:11.468
What will you need?

01:14:11.543 --> 01:14:14.671
Well... l need one of those
big mikes used in functions.

01:14:14.746 --> 01:14:16.680
You mean these?
- Yes, that.

01:14:16.748 --> 01:14:19.046
Haaris Saeed's rally is on the 15th.

01:14:19.150 --> 01:14:21.345
And the doctor will be
visiting Umavi on the 1 4th.

01:14:21.419 --> 01:14:23.148
Even if both our plans succeed..

01:14:23.221 --> 01:14:25.553
..we can't kill both
of them at the same time.

01:14:25.623 --> 01:14:26.749
lt's just not possible.

01:14:26.824 --> 01:14:27.791
lt's possible.

01:14:28.159 --> 01:14:32.118
lf Umavi's doctor visits
him on the 15th instead of the 1 4th.

01:14:32.363 --> 01:14:33.660
And how will that happen?

01:14:35.066 --> 01:14:38.160
Khalid was telling me about
a nurse at that doctor's clinic.

01:14:38.703 --> 01:14:40.227
Your notion was right.

01:14:40.305 --> 01:14:41.329
The equipment for the rally..

01:14:41.406 --> 01:14:43.738
..is being supplied by Rasheed.
- Good.

01:14:44.008 --> 01:14:48.445
Listen, l need to speak
to you about Shehzad's marriage.

01:14:48.513 --> 01:14:50.003
Shehzad's marriage?

01:14:51.683 --> 01:14:54.015
We'll take your
plaster off in a week.

01:14:54.152 --> 01:14:57.121
The doctor's leaving in 10 minutes.

01:14:57.188 --> 01:14:59.782
And he's asking for Hamid
Alam's medicines, immediately.

01:15:01.659 --> 01:15:03.627
Khalid was talking about him.

01:15:05.029 --> 01:15:07.259
Her husband passed away
one year after their marriage.

01:15:08.399 --> 01:15:09.491
She had only one son. Arshad.

01:15:09.567 --> 01:15:11.330
Amina Bi raised him alone.

01:15:11.536 --> 01:15:14.096
He became a suicide
bomber for Lashkar.

01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:18.506
Khalid was saying,
after Arshad's death..

01:15:18.576 --> 01:15:22.205
..few of Lashkar's leaders
came to her...to show sympathy.

01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:23.247
And to give her the money..

01:15:23.314 --> 01:15:25.441
..which is normally given
to the family of suicide bombers.

01:15:28.653 --> 01:15:31.178
Amina Bi refused to take the money.

01:15:31.255 --> 01:15:32.483
He never listens..

01:15:32.557 --> 01:15:35.287
ln fact, she didn't let
them set foot in the house.

01:15:35.493 --> 01:15:36.517
What do you mean isn't not there?

01:15:36.594 --> 01:15:38.118
Didn't you ask him?

01:15:38.196 --> 01:15:39.720
l got up at 4:30..

01:15:39.998 --> 01:15:41.329
And now you expect me to..

01:15:44.435 --> 01:15:46.403
l'm getting you married in 2 days.

01:15:49.273 --> 01:15:50.433
Are you listening?

01:15:50.508 --> 01:15:52.408
l'm getting you married.

01:15:53.244 --> 01:15:55.542
l don't like such sick jokes.

01:15:56.014 --> 01:15:57.311
lt's true.

01:16:04.022 --> 01:16:05.080
Here.

01:16:05.156 --> 01:16:06.145
This is 50,000.

01:16:06.224 --> 01:16:08.488
And l'm giving you 300,000
instead of 100,000.

01:16:08.559 --> 01:16:10.026
Let there be a grand wedding.

01:16:10.061 --> 01:16:11.619
l'll give you the rest tomorrow.

01:16:11.763 --> 01:16:13.355
Take it. lt's yours.

01:16:13.631 --> 01:16:14.529
Mine?

01:16:14.599 --> 01:16:17.295
Stop staring. lt's yours.

01:16:17.769 --> 01:16:21.034
Thank you, brother. Thank you.

01:16:22.473 --> 01:16:24.498
l will never forget this favor.

01:16:24.575 --> 01:16:26.543
l will return every penny.

01:16:26.611 --> 01:16:29.102
Let go...or l'll
cancel your wedding.

01:16:34.585 --> 01:16:36.553
l'll go tell my mom.

01:16:38.623 --> 01:16:41.183
Now you see how Prince Shehzad
will get married.

01:16:54.205 --> 01:16:55.570
Greetings.

01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:57.264
Greetings.

01:16:57.442 --> 01:17:02.243
My name's Nawaz Mistry.
l work for Medicine lnternational.

01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:05.278
We're running a medical
relief camp out here.

01:17:05.616 --> 01:17:09.416
But we're short on volunteers...
especially medical staff.

01:17:09.487 --> 01:17:12.251
Are you Pakistani?
- Yes.

01:17:12.523 --> 01:17:13.820
Your accent is different.

01:17:14.225 --> 01:17:15.556
l'm a Parsi.

01:17:15.727 --> 01:17:18.389
My family's in South
Africa...since decades.

01:17:18.463 --> 01:17:20.522
But we've worked
many years in Pakistan.

01:17:20.598 --> 01:17:23.590
We need experienced people like you.

01:17:23.668 --> 01:17:25.693
Would you like to
work at this clinic?

01:17:27.338 --> 01:17:29.135
Any amount of time
that you can share?

01:17:29.173 --> 01:17:30.105
No.

01:17:42.053 --> 01:17:44.521
l heard about your son.

01:17:45.823 --> 01:17:49.259
We get many blast
victims of Arshad's age.

01:17:51.696 --> 01:17:53.493
You lost your son.

01:17:53.664 --> 01:17:55.393
You can understand their pain.

01:17:55.466 --> 01:17:58.230
l think you should leave.

01:17:58.569 --> 01:18:00.628
Please visit the camp once.

01:18:01.172 --> 01:18:03.800
See the condition they are in.

01:18:04.108 --> 01:18:06.099
We really need your help.

01:18:06.244 --> 01:18:09.213
The rest is up to you,
whether you want to help us or not.

01:18:10.214 --> 01:18:11.374
Goodbye!

01:18:14.786 --> 01:18:16.276
How many files, Firoz?

01:18:16.854 --> 01:18:19.084
Sir, l've scanned
through half of it.

01:18:19.157 --> 01:18:21.148
And finish the rest
by tomorrow night.

01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:24.390
4 mikes,
2 speakers and disco lights.

01:18:24.462 --> 01:18:25.326
For a wedding.

01:18:25.396 --> 01:18:27.796
When is the wedding?
- Day after tomorrow.

01:18:28.766 --> 01:18:29.733
Day after tomorrow?

01:18:29.801 --> 01:18:31.666
And you're giving the order so soon?

01:18:32.136 --> 01:18:33.603
Are you running away with the girl?

01:18:34.539 --> 01:18:36.803
l'm joking.
1 4th isn't possible.

01:18:37.141 --> 01:18:38.165
There's a rally on the 15th.

01:18:38.242 --> 01:18:41.075
Look, l'll send back all the stuff
day after tomorrow night itself.

01:18:41.145 --> 01:18:42.043
Safe and sound.

01:18:42.113 --> 01:18:44.343
That's alright,
but this is impossible.

01:18:44.415 --> 01:18:46.383
After all, it's Mr. Sheikh's rally.

01:18:46.684 --> 01:18:48.481
Where else can l go now?

01:18:48.553 --> 01:18:50.248
That's your problem.

01:18:53.324 --> 01:18:56.725
Look... l'll pay you
the money in advance.

01:18:57.662 --> 01:18:58.822
Cash.

01:19:00.364 --> 01:19:01.331
Huh!

01:19:01.365 --> 01:19:04.266
And you can keep your share too.

01:19:06.237 --> 01:19:07.568
What do you want?

01:19:08.272 --> 01:19:10.172
l'll go take a look.

01:19:23.588 --> 01:19:25.078
Two children.

01:19:25.389 --> 01:19:28.119
3 year old girl and 7 month old boy.

01:19:28.326 --> 01:19:30.692
She had gone to buy toys
for them from jumma market.

01:19:41.038 --> 01:19:42.733
He's just 16 years old.

01:19:43.341 --> 01:19:46.367
Lost both his legs at the
blast outside the big mosque.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:23.147 --> 01:20:25.172
l didn't know anything.

01:20:26.083 --> 01:20:30.281
l had no clue...
when he set out on this path.

01:20:31.355 --> 01:20:35.189
lf only l knew... l would've
never let him do it.

01:20:35.293 --> 01:20:38.319
l would've put him
on a muzzle, but..

01:20:38.496 --> 01:20:44.765
l would've never allowed
him to spread such terror.

01:20:46.437 --> 01:20:47.631
Sit down.

01:20:52.276 --> 01:20:54.267
''lt's the call of Allah.''

01:20:54.612 --> 01:20:56.443
''You'll be sent to Heaven.''

01:20:57.114 --> 01:21:00.174
''A martyr's face glows with grace.''

01:21:00.251 --> 01:21:02.651
This is what they told
him and took him along.

01:21:04.188 --> 01:21:07.419
But he returned in plastic bags.

01:21:08.159 --> 01:21:11.356
Poor boy...didn't even have a face.

01:21:11.829 --> 01:21:15.128
They had slaughtered my son.

01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:20.229
And to make sure that Arshad's
coffin doesn't seem light..

01:21:20.438 --> 01:21:27.139
..they put stones
along with pieces of my child.

01:21:34.418 --> 01:21:38.445
No mother should face what you did.

01:21:40.057 --> 01:21:44.357
Those who separate children
from their mothers..

01:21:44.428 --> 01:21:48.159
..and turn them into murderers...

01:21:49.233 --> 01:21:51.497
...should be sent to hell.

01:21:54.772 --> 01:21:57.172
Don't you want the people..

01:21:57.241 --> 01:22:01.234
..who took your Arshad
from you to pay?

01:22:02.079 --> 01:22:03.103
Who are you?

01:22:03.214 --> 01:22:04.374
We need your help.

01:22:04.448 --> 01:22:05.745
What help?

01:22:05.816 --> 01:22:09.217
We need your help in saving these
kids from turning into murderers.

01:22:09.387 --> 01:22:10.319
Get out.

01:22:10.454 --> 01:22:12.752
You can save many more lives.

01:22:12.823 --> 01:22:14.290
l said get out.

01:22:14.392 --> 01:22:17.088
You know the pain
of losing your son.

01:22:17.228 --> 01:22:19.458
Think about the thousands
of mothers like you.

01:22:19.663 --> 01:22:21.392
Get out now.

01:22:24.335 --> 01:22:25.495
Aunty, is everything fine?

01:22:26.237 --> 01:22:27.727
Open the door.

01:22:30.741 --> 01:22:31.673
What?

01:22:42.453 --> 01:22:43.750
''My infidelity sways,''

01:22:44.021 --> 01:22:45.283
''My loyalty sways.''

01:22:45.356 --> 01:22:47.790
''Your slave sways,''

01:22:48.059 --> 01:22:52.462
''My lord sways.''

01:22:52.730 --> 01:22:54.129
''The first and last letters''

01:22:54.198 --> 01:22:55.563
''Of revelation sway,''

01:22:55.599 --> 01:22:58.363
''Heaven and earth sway,''

01:22:58.402 --> 01:23:03.135
''The skies swoon and sway.''

01:23:03.474 --> 01:23:08.275
''l won't be able to tell my truth,''

01:23:08.412 --> 01:23:11.347
''You won't be able
to bear my truth,''

01:23:11.415 --> 01:23:15.408
''My Lord.''

01:23:16.353 --> 01:23:18.719
''Let me just keep giving my life,''

01:23:18.789 --> 01:23:20.416
''ln your name,''

01:23:20.491 --> 01:23:24.052
''My lord.''

01:23:44.348 --> 01:23:46.441
Out of these 2000 inmates..

01:23:46.484 --> 01:23:49.009
..275 came after Headley.

01:23:49.086 --> 01:23:50.644
And 115 of them are still in.

01:23:50.721 --> 01:23:55.681
So around 160 of them arrived
in jail after Headley..

01:23:55.759 --> 01:23:57.693
..and were released after his death.

01:23:57.761 --> 01:24:00.355
Give me details of these 160 files.

01:24:00.498 --> 01:24:02.489
When is the doctor visiting Umavi?

01:24:02.666 --> 01:24:03.598
Tomorrow.

01:24:05.569 --> 01:24:07.332
Can you do something..

01:24:07.438 --> 01:24:10.464
..to make him go day
after instead of tomorrow.

01:24:13.577 --> 01:24:14.669
Jude Rosario.

01:24:15.446 --> 01:24:17.346
He was imprisoned few
days Before Headley's killing..

01:24:17.414 --> 01:24:19.609
..for the murder of some
stuntman called Mathew Brody.

01:24:20.317 --> 01:24:23.616
But few days after Headley's
killing... Mathew Brody was found alive.

01:24:23.787 --> 01:24:27.086
Since there was no murder case,
Jude Rosario was released.

01:24:27.525 --> 01:24:28.617
Yes...

01:24:29.059 --> 01:24:30.287
Yes, coming.

01:24:32.062 --> 01:24:33.120
Give it.

01:24:33.197 --> 01:24:34.425
Thank you.

01:25:22.513 --> 01:25:25.175
Hello, doctor.
- Hello.

01:25:25.249 --> 01:25:27.308
How's everything.
- lt's the grace of Allah.

01:25:27.384 --> 01:25:30.080
Check his bag properly.
- Take a good look.

01:25:30.154 --> 01:25:31.416
Same old things that
l bring every week.

01:25:31.488 --> 01:25:33.149
Agreed, doctor.

01:25:33.257 --> 01:25:35.191
But it's our duty,
we have to do it.

01:25:35.259 --> 01:25:36.351
Of course..

01:25:37.728 --> 01:25:39.025
Hold on.

01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:44.560
What's wrong, doctor?

01:25:47.504 --> 01:25:50.496
Hello. - Amina Bi,
you packed the wrong injections.

01:25:50.574 --> 01:25:52.474
l apologies, doctor.

01:25:52.610 --> 01:25:56.273
l don't know how.. - l wonder
what's gotten into you these days.

01:25:56.347 --> 01:25:59.339
l apologies, doctor.
lt won't happen again.

01:25:59.650 --> 01:26:01.311
l'll have to come back tomorrow.

01:26:05.222 --> 01:26:07.417
Last time...
do you know who this man is?

01:26:07.491 --> 01:26:10.085
l told you...
l don't know him.

01:26:10.261 --> 01:26:11.193
No...

01:26:15.065 --> 01:26:17.693
Now...do you recognize this man?

01:26:31.682 --> 01:26:33.547
Sir, according to
our agent in Chicago..

01:26:33.617 --> 01:26:35.278
..Jude Rosario paid a
fat amount to Mathew Brody..

01:26:35.352 --> 01:26:37.286
..for falling off the bridge.

01:26:37.354 --> 01:26:38.446
lt was a fake case all along.

01:26:38.522 --> 01:26:41.548
lt means this man Jude Rosario
went to prison intentionally.

01:26:43.193 --> 01:26:44.660
The stuff's here.

01:26:44.728 --> 01:26:47.128
Setup two mikes and
speakers on the stage..

01:26:47.197 --> 01:26:48.528
..and give me the rest of it.

01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:52.396
Bring me Daniyal Khan's photo.

01:26:57.841 --> 01:27:00.105
''My heart's been murdered.''

01:27:00.177 --> 01:27:02.111
''Your gaze is a killer.''

01:27:02.179 --> 01:27:04.113
''A lovely damsel.''

01:27:04.181 --> 01:27:06.206
''A glowing beauty.''

01:27:06.283 --> 01:27:11.585
...has been fixed with Razia Abid
Ali for a compensation of 5000 coins.

01:27:11.655 --> 01:27:12.713
Do you accept?

01:27:12.790 --> 01:27:13.722
l accept.

01:27:13.791 --> 01:27:15.759
''Like the Aghan delicacy.''

01:27:15.826 --> 01:27:17.088
Do you accept?

01:27:17.161 --> 01:27:18.253
l accept.

01:27:18.329 --> 01:27:19.626
Do you accept?

01:27:19.697 --> 01:27:20.823
l accept.

01:27:21.231 --> 01:27:22.459
''Oh wow!''

01:27:22.533 --> 01:27:26.299
''Are you going to love me...
at gunpoint.''

01:27:26.370 --> 01:27:29.533
''Or will you ever
show your face too.

01:27:29.606 --> 01:27:30.402
''Oh wow!''

01:27:30.474 --> 01:27:31.441
Sir.

01:27:33.510 --> 01:27:34.670
lt's him...bloody..

01:27:34.745 --> 01:27:36.576
Daniyal Khan is Jude Rosario.

01:27:36.647 --> 01:27:38.615
''Like the Aghan delicacy.''

01:27:38.682 --> 01:27:40.582
''A treacherous lover.''

01:27:40.684 --> 01:27:42.777
''Your lover's mortally wounded.''

01:27:43.087 --> 01:27:44.315
''oh wow!

01:27:44.388 --> 01:27:46.481
l want pictures of every person..

01:27:46.557 --> 01:27:49.048
..who entered Pakistan
after Qureshi's murder.

01:27:49.126 --> 01:27:49.592
Sir.

01:27:49.660 --> 01:27:52.561
Contact every big and small
airports... every entry point.

01:28:05.609 --> 01:28:06.303
Hello.

01:28:06.377 --> 01:28:07.139
Hello.

01:28:07.244 --> 01:28:08.438
Yes.
- What?

01:28:10.714 --> 01:28:13.410
Khalid. lt's ready.

01:28:14.752 --> 01:28:15.719
l'll check right away.

01:28:15.786 --> 01:28:16.582
Don't worry, sir.

01:28:16.653 --> 01:28:17.551
l'll check all the photos right now.

01:28:17.621 --> 01:28:18.451
l'll check, sir.

01:28:19.223 --> 01:28:23.182
''l am a decent guy,
my faith's in Allah.''

01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:31.326
''But after l played this game,
l am good for nothing now.''

01:28:31.402 --> 01:28:35.361
''l recited a sonnet of Mir.''

01:28:35.439 --> 01:28:39.500
''And took a sip of liquor.''

01:28:39.576 --> 01:28:43.205
''And now my name's tainted.''

01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:45.271
''O Sweetheart.''

01:28:45.349 --> 01:28:47.317
''O beautiful girl.''

01:28:47.384 --> 01:28:49.147
''You're an arrow.''

01:28:49.219 --> 01:28:51.278
''And my heart's the target.''

01:28:51.355 --> 01:28:55.348
''She'll fear God
if not her devotees.''

01:28:55.426 --> 01:28:57.485
''Keep your promises.''

01:28:57.561 --> 01:28:59.586
''O wow!''

01:29:23.387 --> 01:29:31.385
''l'll go and complain
about You to God.''

01:29:31.495 --> 01:29:33.463
The second one's ready as well.

01:29:34.431 --> 01:29:36.023
l'll use this to make a trigger.

01:29:36.099 --> 01:29:37.566
This is a toy car remote.

01:29:37.634 --> 01:29:38.794
Will it work?

01:29:39.169 --> 01:29:42.400
A similar remote was
used in the Boston bombing.

01:29:42.473 --> 01:29:47.308
''l'll complain about you.''

01:29:47.411 --> 01:29:48.810
''l'll trap your finger in the ring.''

01:29:49.079 --> 01:29:50.137
What's the range of the remote?

01:29:50.214 --> 01:29:52.045
l've installed the battery.

01:29:52.382 --> 01:29:56.512
So by tomorrow...it'll work
within a range of 50-60 feet.

01:29:56.587 --> 01:29:59.147
And as the battery weakens..

01:29:59.756 --> 01:30:02.281
The closer you're to the mike,
the better.

01:30:02.359 --> 01:30:05.328
''Don't use your killer
attitude on me.''

01:30:05.395 --> 01:30:07.556
''Oh wow!

01:30:07.631 --> 01:30:11.397
''You'll do more damage
than good to me.''

01:30:11.468 --> 01:30:13.436
''Will you ever make up
for my loses?''

01:30:13.504 --> 01:30:15.495
''Oh wow!

01:30:15.572 --> 01:30:16.504
One more thing.

01:30:16.573 --> 01:30:18.803
There shouldn't be anything
between the mike and the remote.

01:30:19.309 --> 01:30:20.503
Or it won't get the signal.

01:30:21.745 --> 01:30:23.713
''Oh wow!

01:30:24.081 --> 01:30:27.573
''Are you going to love me...
at gunpoint.''

01:30:27.618 --> 01:30:30.143
''Or will you ever
show me your face too.

01:30:30.187 --> 01:30:32.178
''Oh wow!''

01:30:46.570 --> 01:30:49.038
Lahore airport has sent
images only till the 8th.

01:30:49.106 --> 01:30:50.664
The one before this.

01:30:54.144 --> 01:30:55.577
The injections are in this.

01:30:55.712 --> 01:30:57.407
Your new passport.

01:30:57.481 --> 01:30:59.210
l'll call you at 10am.

01:30:59.283 --> 01:31:02.184
You'll be on a flight
before anyone finds out.

01:31:03.554 --> 01:31:05.146
Take care.

01:31:12.296 --> 01:31:13.593
Testing.

01:31:14.464 --> 01:31:16.455
Testing. Testing.

01:31:16.767 --> 01:31:18.496
Testing. Testing.

01:31:18.569 --> 01:31:19.797
Zubaid, is all okay.

01:31:20.103 --> 01:31:21.297
This one isn't working.

01:31:21.371 --> 01:31:23.601
Testing. Testing.
- Open the mike.

01:31:27.244 --> 01:31:28.711
Where are the images
from 9th and 10th?

01:31:28.779 --> 01:31:29.768
Stop. Stop.

01:31:31.582 --> 01:31:33.243
For God sake send them.

01:31:42.025 --> 01:31:43.014
Wait.

01:31:44.528 --> 01:31:47.053
lt's in the wrong socket.

01:31:47.331 --> 01:31:48.355
Check now.

01:31:49.066 --> 01:31:50.658
Testing. Testing.

01:31:51.134 --> 01:31:52.260
lt's working.

01:31:52.536 --> 01:31:54.595
Working...
Check the rest.

01:32:00.711 --> 01:32:01.769
ls it 5?

01:32:02.746 --> 01:32:07.149
When l was a kid,
we used to live in Colaba.

01:32:08.585 --> 01:32:11.782
My father, Nauzun Mistry.

01:32:12.789 --> 01:32:14.484
He was a middle-class man.

01:32:15.225 --> 01:32:16.692
lnsurance agent.

01:32:17.628 --> 01:32:19.528
But Nadia and l..

01:32:20.530 --> 01:32:22.225
Nadia, my sister.

01:32:23.166 --> 01:32:26.158
He would fulfill all our wishes.

01:32:29.239 --> 01:32:31.264
He called us his princesses.

01:32:33.510 --> 01:32:35.375
My little princesses.

01:32:36.647 --> 01:32:41.584
When we got good grades,
or won a medal in sports..

01:32:42.753 --> 01:32:46.484
..or if we simply hugged him.

01:32:47.724 --> 01:32:50.386
Father would take
us out for a treat.

01:32:52.362 --> 01:32:53.294
There.

01:32:54.097 --> 01:32:55.086
At the Taj.

01:33:02.372 --> 01:33:06.103
We would all dress up nicely
and go to the Taj tea room.

01:33:07.310 --> 01:33:10.404
Drink tea...along with
chocolate pastries.

01:33:13.283 --> 01:33:15.808
Then we grew up...
and it felt awkward..

01:33:16.086 --> 01:33:18.418
..to go out with papa for pastries.

01:33:20.057 --> 01:33:21.786
lt just wasn't cool anymore.

01:33:23.326 --> 01:33:24.793
Papa realized this.

01:33:26.563 --> 01:33:30.260
And gradually...our tea
parties at the Taj stopped.

01:33:40.477 --> 01:33:41.705
That day...

01:33:45.549 --> 01:33:47.779
When they attacked the Taj...

01:33:49.219 --> 01:33:51.210
...set it on fire.

01:33:52.689 --> 01:33:56.716
lt felt like someone was settling
my childhood memories ablaze.

01:33:59.196 --> 01:34:01.630
They think they will go to Heaven.

01:34:02.532 --> 01:34:05.558
These rascals won't even
get a place in hell.

01:34:13.176 --> 01:34:15.076
When we get out of here,

01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:18.810
do you know what's the first thing
we should do?

01:34:21.518 --> 01:34:23.543
Go to the Taj and have a cup of tea.

01:34:26.690 --> 01:34:28.248
With chocolate pastries.

01:34:29.526 --> 01:34:35.988
''Why didn't we meet earlier?''

01:34:36.533 --> 01:34:42.597
''Why did we burn alone?''

01:34:44.407 --> 01:34:51.779
''Together...we're complete.''

01:34:52.315 --> 01:34:58.220
''Or were we better alone?''

01:34:59.456 --> 01:35:06.419
''My beloved.''

01:35:07.063 --> 01:35:12.091
''My beloved.''

01:35:31.054 --> 01:35:32.419
Shehzad.
- Brother.

01:35:34.491 --> 01:35:36.652
Take this money and leave right now.

01:35:36.726 --> 01:35:37.715
Now.

01:35:37.994 --> 01:35:40.360
Go away.
Why? And this money.

01:35:40.430 --> 01:35:44.298
lt's all yours. But please
leave as soon as possible.

01:35:44.668 --> 01:35:46.226
Tell me what's wrong?

01:35:46.303 --> 01:35:47.531
Nothing, my son.

01:35:47.637 --> 01:35:50.105
Just leave. Leave now.

01:35:52.676 --> 01:35:53.540
Brother.

01:35:53.643 --> 01:35:54.667
Brother.

01:35:58.281 --> 01:35:59.213
Sir.

01:35:59.282 --> 01:36:00.510
Haider sir.

01:36:01.084 --> 01:36:03.075
Sir, he entered
Pakistan on the 10th.

01:36:03.186 --> 01:36:04.278
From Lahore Airport.

01:36:04.387 --> 01:36:07.254
Check every hotel,
every guesthouse of the Johar area.

01:36:07.324 --> 01:36:09.622
Talk to every estate agency,
every broker.

01:36:10.193 --> 01:36:12.787
Maybe he rented a place.

01:36:17.634 --> 01:36:19.124
Show me your register.

01:36:45.495 --> 01:36:47.622
Have you seen this man?
- No, l have not.

01:36:51.301 --> 01:36:53.769
Take a good look.
- No, sir. l have not seen him.

01:37:00.076 --> 01:37:02.704
Doctor, l've kept the
injections in the bag.

01:37:03.580 --> 01:37:05.514
Did you check them properly? - Yes.

01:37:10.553 --> 01:37:12.487
Thank you.

01:37:20.196 --> 01:37:23.723
l've to go early in the
morning...all because of you.

01:37:33.510 --> 01:37:35.034
Long live.. - Haaris Saeed!

01:37:35.111 --> 01:37:38.740
Long live.. - Haaris Saeed!

01:37:39.149 --> 01:37:42.607
What's does Haaris Saeed mean to us?
- There's no God, only Allah!

01:37:42.652 --> 01:37:46.349
What's does Haaris Saeed mean to us?
- There's no God, only Allah!

01:37:46.423 --> 01:37:49.483
What's does Haaris Saeed mean to us?
- There's no God, only Allah!

01:37:49.592 --> 01:37:51.116
We'll meet back here in an hour.

01:37:51.261 --> 01:37:53.320
We will leave for
the airport from here.

01:37:53.496 --> 01:37:55.361
What's does Haaris Saeed mean to us?

01:37:55.432 --> 01:37:56.490
Daniyal.

01:37:56.599 --> 01:37:58.794
What's does Haaris Saeed mean to us?
- There's no God, only Allah!

01:37:59.069 --> 01:38:00.161
Keep the outfit.

01:38:00.537 --> 01:38:02.437
What's does Haaris Saeed mean to us?

01:38:02.505 --> 01:38:03.563
You're looking nice.

01:38:05.275 --> 01:38:12.647
''Couldn't be mine...
nor could be yours.''

01:38:12.716 --> 01:38:20.122
''l couldn't endure
this atrocity of love.''

01:38:20.156 --> 01:38:27.392
''Couldn't be mine...
nor could be yours.''

01:38:27.430 --> 01:38:34.666
''l couldn't endure
this atrocity of love.''

01:38:35.672 --> 01:38:37.799
Aunty, has the doctor left?

01:38:41.478 --> 01:38:44.140
Has the doctor left?
- Yes, he just did.

01:38:44.547 --> 01:38:46.037
You're early today.

01:38:46.116 --> 01:38:47.208
Yeah, the tetanus booster shots..

01:38:47.283 --> 01:38:48.307
What are you doing?

01:38:48.385 --> 01:38:50.546
Let me arrange for
the booster shots.

01:38:51.755 --> 01:38:53.746
Long live..
- Haaris Saeed!

01:38:54.057 --> 01:38:56.082
Long live..
- Haaris Saeed!

01:38:56.159 --> 01:38:58.150
Long live..
- Haaris Saeed!

01:38:58.228 --> 01:39:00.253
Long live..
- Haaris Saeed!

01:39:00.330 --> 01:39:02.321
Long live..
- Haaris Saeed!

01:39:02.399 --> 01:39:04.629
Long live..
- Haaris Saeed!

01:39:04.701 --> 01:39:06.692
Long live..
- Haaris Saeed!

01:39:06.770 --> 01:39:08.829
Long live..
- Haaris Saeed!

01:39:09.105 --> 01:39:10.834
Long live..
- Haaris Saeed!

01:39:11.107 --> 01:39:13.098
Long live..
- Haaris Saeed!

01:39:14.611 --> 01:39:17.580
Aunty...where did the
second box come from?

01:39:18.181 --> 01:39:19.648
What box?

01:39:21.117 --> 01:39:22.516
Umbvi sir's medicines.

01:39:24.187 --> 01:39:26.121
Long live..
- Haaris Saeed!

01:39:26.189 --> 01:39:28.123
Long live..
- Haaris Saeed!

01:39:28.191 --> 01:39:31.160
Long live.. - Haaris Saeed!
- Enough!

01:39:31.227 --> 01:39:33.058
Be quiet!

01:39:36.366 --> 01:39:39.767
What's that?
- lt's a toy car...for my son.

01:39:40.036 --> 01:39:40.798
Show me.

01:39:41.071 --> 01:39:47.635
Professor Haaris Saeed
sir is amongst us.

01:39:47.710 --> 01:39:49.200
Sir, l just bought it.

01:39:49.746 --> 01:39:52.271
lf l open this up,
my son won't stop pestering me.

01:39:53.683 --> 01:39:55.651
Didn't you hear...show me.

01:39:55.685 --> 01:39:57.516
Or else you won't
get home to your kid.

01:39:59.522 --> 01:40:05.461
Please welcome him
with full enthusiasm.

01:40:07.664 --> 01:40:09.723
The doctor must have
bought these. Yes.

01:40:10.100 --> 01:40:11.499
But he never does that.

01:40:11.634 --> 01:40:14.102
And l always give him
a list of medicines to buy.

01:40:14.471 --> 01:40:16.063
We purchase this medicine
only once a month.

01:40:16.139 --> 01:40:18.835
And l'm the only one who makes an
entry and stocks it in the fridge.

01:40:19.209 --> 01:40:20.642
l said l don't know.

01:40:20.710 --> 01:40:23.144
l am not feeling well...
l'm going home.

01:40:23.213 --> 01:40:24.612
What's wrong, aunty?

01:40:25.115 --> 01:40:26.207
Aunty?

01:40:26.549 --> 01:40:27.675
Listen up.

01:40:29.119 --> 01:40:31.178
Fine, go on.

01:40:33.289 --> 01:40:35.018
We're with you.

01:40:38.695 --> 01:40:41.129
We've proven to the world..

01:40:41.197 --> 01:40:44.098
..that we Pakistanis
are not afraid..

01:40:44.167 --> 01:40:46.658
..when it comes to upholding lslam.

01:40:47.103 --> 01:40:49.071
Not from that cruel America..

01:40:49.139 --> 01:40:52.074
..nor his infidel accomplice lndia.

01:40:52.142 --> 01:40:53.666
What does lndia want?

01:40:53.743 --> 01:40:55.335
Sir, we're checking
hotels in the Johar area.

01:40:55.411 --> 01:40:57.208
Sir...we just received
a call from Pearl Hotel.

01:40:57.280 --> 01:40:58.212
That's where the bas*** was living.

01:40:58.281 --> 01:40:59.248
He just checked out.

01:40:59.315 --> 01:41:01.510
Circulate his photo all around town.

01:41:01.584 --> 01:41:05.680
Every security personnel in Sheikh
sir's rally should have his photo.

01:41:06.356 --> 01:41:08.620
Did you get the right
bottles today, doctor?

01:41:31.114 --> 01:41:35.312
O lndians...come to your
senses...know your place.

01:41:35.385 --> 01:41:38.354
l challenged you before...

01:41:38.421 --> 01:41:41.652
Call me to any court
of law in this world.

01:41:41.724 --> 01:41:45.683
And we'll prove who
the real terrorists are.

01:41:57.574 --> 01:41:59.599
Doctor, where are you going?

01:41:59.676 --> 01:42:02.770
Uncle's waiting for you.
The pain's increasing, come quickly.

01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:06.778
l'll answer it later.
- Alright.

01:42:07.183 --> 01:42:12.416
You lndians want
action against Pakistan.

01:42:16.125 --> 01:42:20.653
Poor lndia...they only express
their motives on television.

01:42:23.099 --> 01:42:26.159
The court has
honorably acquitted me.

01:42:26.236 --> 01:42:28.568
Did you attach a copy
of the delivery receipt?

01:42:31.574 --> 01:42:33.269
Who is it?

01:42:33.776 --> 01:42:37.644
lf lndia doesn't want to
settle these problems in the court..

01:42:37.714 --> 01:42:40.114
..then what does lndia want?

01:42:45.021 --> 01:42:46.181
Sabahuddin Umavi.

01:42:46.256 --> 01:42:48.224
Lashkar-e-Taiba's founding member.

01:42:50.293 --> 01:42:52.261
Faster.
Bravo.

01:42:52.662 --> 01:42:57.622
He personally trained Kasab...
and the other nine terrorists.

01:42:59.636 --> 01:43:00.568
Faster.

01:43:00.637 --> 01:43:02.434
Faster...like a monkey.

01:43:02.505 --> 01:43:05.406
On 27th November,
Umavi ordered his terrorists..

01:43:05.475 --> 01:43:08.808
..to burn down Oberoi and the Taj.

01:43:13.750 --> 01:43:15.308
Where's the doctor?

01:43:15.385 --> 01:43:17.580
Greetings, brother.
- Greetings.

01:43:17.654 --> 01:43:20.145
l apologies for yesterday.
- lt's alright.

01:43:21.724 --> 01:43:26.388
Fine...if lndia says
they want strict actions..

01:43:26.429 --> 01:43:29.159
..then so be it.

01:43:30.199 --> 01:43:32.190
He's been pestering for so long.

01:43:35.571 --> 01:43:38.369
Why are you calling continuously?
The doctor's busy.

01:43:38.441 --> 01:43:39.567
Stop the doctor.

01:43:39.642 --> 01:43:42.008
Don't let him administer
the injection.

01:43:45.581 --> 01:43:47.208
Stop the doctor.

01:43:47.283 --> 01:43:49.615
Just like this
enthusiasm in Lahore..

01:43:49.686 --> 01:43:54.020
..it will grow to
every city in Pakistan.

01:43:54.090 --> 01:43:58.322
This will ruin lndia
and set Kashmir free.

01:44:03.666 --> 01:44:05.725
What does lndia think?

01:44:05.802 --> 01:44:07.167
The moment has passed.

01:44:07.203 --> 01:44:09.467
This is the moment for Jihad.

01:44:14.410 --> 01:44:16.344
They play such dirty games.

01:44:16.412 --> 01:44:18.141
What does lndia want?

01:44:18.314 --> 01:44:20.248
What does lndia want?

01:44:28.491 --> 01:44:33.485
Our Kashmiri brethren..

01:44:39.068 --> 01:44:43.129
Even America and Russia
couldn't stand against our Jihad.

01:44:47.110 --> 01:44:49.670
And by the grace of Allah,
lndia will fall as well.

01:44:51.748 --> 01:44:56.048
Haaris sir...march ahead.
- We're with you.

01:44:57.320 --> 01:45:02.019
Haaris sir...march ahead.
- We're with you.

01:45:33.623 --> 01:45:36.057
What was the jail security doing?

01:45:36.159 --> 01:45:37.456
Rascals!

01:45:38.161 --> 01:45:41.096
Seal all exit points
out of the city.

01:45:41.164 --> 01:45:43.325
Airports,
land borders, trains, busses!

01:45:43.399 --> 01:45:45.299
Shut down the entire city.

01:45:45.368 --> 01:45:46.699
Where's Sheikh sir?

01:45:47.537 --> 01:45:49.266
Where's Haaris Saeed?

01:45:49.338 --> 01:45:52.136
Keep calling us terrorists
and we keep quiet.

01:45:52.375 --> 01:45:53.205
At the rally.

01:45:53.276 --> 01:45:55.540
Get him out.
Have our men escort him home.

01:45:55.611 --> 01:45:56.305
Now!

01:45:56.379 --> 01:45:59.177
What's does Haaris Saeed mean to us?
- There's no God, only Allah!

01:45:59.248 --> 01:46:00.613
And that doctor.
Did he say something?

01:46:00.716 --> 01:46:02.115
He wasn't behind it, sir.
- Then?

01:46:02.185 --> 01:46:04.050
Someone exchanged the
injections at the clinic.

01:46:04.153 --> 01:46:06.018
They want us to hide in a corner?

01:46:06.122 --> 01:46:08.488
Never! Never!

01:46:08.558 --> 01:46:12.358
Listen carefully to
our message to lndia..

01:46:48.731 --> 01:46:49.755
Quickly.

01:46:50.766 --> 01:46:51.596
Hurry up.

01:46:51.667 --> 01:46:53.498
Get the car. Hurry up.

01:47:10.219 --> 01:47:12.813
Move. Move aside.

01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:18.658
Stop.

01:47:18.728 --> 01:47:20.093
Stop him!

01:47:25.868 --> 01:47:29.133
Someone's chasing Sheikh
sir's car in a police vehicle.

01:47:29.472 --> 01:47:30.700
Stop him.

01:47:31.173 --> 01:47:32.800
Hurry up,
Sheikh sir's car is coming this way.

01:47:33.075 --> 01:47:34.337
Move the barricades.

01:47:41.784 --> 01:47:42.716
Fire.

01:48:44.580 --> 01:48:46.810
Move the bamboos.
Hurry up.

01:48:53.789 --> 01:48:55.120
Break it down.

01:49:04.634 --> 01:49:07.797
Wait a minute, brother.
- Come soon, dear.

01:49:08.371 --> 01:49:10.362
Move!

01:49:10.506 --> 01:49:11.666
Move!

01:49:11.741 --> 01:49:13.106
Wait a minute, brother.

01:49:13.175 --> 01:49:14.574
Move!

01:49:18.681 --> 01:49:21.343
Quickly.

01:49:21.417 --> 01:49:22.748
Come, dear.

01:49:22.818 --> 01:49:24.513
Just a minute..

01:49:29.792 --> 01:49:31.259
Why you...

01:49:33.462 --> 01:49:34.520
Stop..

01:49:40.703 --> 01:49:42.534
Why did you do it, ma'am?

01:49:43.272 --> 01:49:44.569
For Pakistan.

01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:46.107
Ma'am!

01:51:18.834 --> 01:51:20.495
Haaris Saeed.

01:51:21.537 --> 01:51:26.372
You keep asking...
what does lndia want?

01:51:28.444 --> 01:51:31.436
lndia wants...justice!

01:51:58.541 --> 01:52:00.065
Where's Amina Bi?

01:52:05.314 --> 01:52:06.440
Yes, sir.

01:52:09.652 --> 01:52:11.085
Go...go..

01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:18.819
What's your exit plan?

01:52:19.094 --> 01:52:20.618
lt's impossible
to get to the airport?

01:52:20.696 --> 01:52:22.823
Daniyal, they'll close
down the entire city.

01:52:23.098 --> 01:52:25.191
Get out of there at any cost.

01:52:28.537 --> 01:52:29.834
l'll call you later, sir.

01:52:30.105 --> 01:52:31.834
Okay, but keep your phone on.

01:52:32.074 --> 01:52:32.665
Fine.

01:52:34.743 --> 01:52:37.735
Take your clothes off...
quickly.

01:52:39.114 --> 01:52:40.274
lt'll expire soon...
get it renewed.

01:52:40.349 --> 01:52:42.112
Fine.
- Let him through.

01:52:44.386 --> 01:52:45.614
Hey...

01:52:45.688 --> 01:52:46.655
Stop!

01:52:49.358 --> 01:52:50.655
Stop! Stop! Stop!

01:52:57.132 --> 01:52:58.599
Sir, what are you doing?

01:52:58.667 --> 01:53:00.100
Honestly, sir. l swear.

01:53:00.169 --> 01:53:01.466
This man came to my shop alone..

01:53:01.537 --> 01:53:03.164
..to rent my stuff for the wedding.

01:53:03.239 --> 01:53:04.706
Who's wedding was it?

01:53:09.178 --> 01:53:09.803
What is it?

01:53:10.079 --> 01:53:11.137
She's in labor.

01:53:11.180 --> 01:53:12.374
The pain's excruciating.

01:53:12.448 --> 01:53:14.245
We've to get to the hospital.

01:53:14.316 --> 01:53:15.578
lt'll only take a minute,
let me check.

01:53:15.684 --> 01:53:19.415
Rascal... l am dying...
let's go now!

01:53:19.488 --> 01:53:21.422
lt'll only take a minute,
let me check. Wait...

01:53:21.490 --> 01:53:24.220
Don't you have
a mother you scoundrel.

01:53:24.293 --> 01:53:29.390
lf anything happens to my kid...
l won't spare any of you.

01:53:29.465 --> 01:53:31.797
Rascal...get out of here quickly.

01:53:32.067 --> 01:53:34.194
Come on.
Let them through.

01:53:44.380 --> 01:53:45.369
Daniyal.

01:53:47.650 --> 01:53:50.483
The lndian border is
only 26 kilometers from here.

01:53:50.552 --> 01:53:52.247
Cover every nook and corner.

01:53:52.354 --> 01:53:55.346
Sir, they will seal the
entire border around Lahore.

01:53:55.524 --> 01:53:57.355
Sir, we've some
contacts at Dera Nanak.

01:53:57.426 --> 01:54:00.293
Tell them to drive
towards north from Lahore.

01:54:00.362 --> 01:54:03.263
Seal Lalo and Dhilwan roads too.

01:54:03.332 --> 01:54:04.629
Check every car.

01:54:04.700 --> 01:54:07.498
But, sir...they can also
head for the Afghanistan border.

01:54:07.569 --> 01:54:09.503
Or... lran.
- But the borders..

01:54:09.571 --> 01:54:12.233
Sir, all the land
borders will be sealed.

01:54:12.308 --> 01:54:14.538
Tell them to drive southwards,
towards Karachi.

01:54:14.610 --> 01:54:16.669
But this way they will
be trapped inside Pakistan.

01:54:16.745 --> 01:54:19.680
Sir, Daniyal can come
the same way they did.

01:54:21.383 --> 01:54:24.250
From Karachi...in a boat.

01:54:25.287 --> 01:54:28.051
But it'll take us at least
10 hours to get to Karachi.

01:54:28.123 --> 01:54:29.681
There is no other way, Daniyal.

01:54:29.725 --> 01:54:32.387
lt's impossible to cross
any other border of Pakistan.

01:54:32.761 --> 01:54:34.319
He isn't here.

01:54:34.363 --> 01:54:36.160
Let's look at the back.

01:54:36.231 --> 01:54:37.528
After the 26/11 attack..

01:54:37.599 --> 01:54:40.591
..we planted one of our man
at the Manora Jetty petrol pump.

01:54:40.669 --> 01:54:44.127
Sir, that man can
take Daniyal in his boat.

01:54:48.711 --> 01:54:50.144
But, sir...
- But what?

01:54:50.212 --> 01:54:52.737
Only till the Pakistani
territorial boater's limit.

01:54:53.015 --> 01:54:55.176
Beyond that...the Pakistani
navy will intercept them.

01:54:55.250 --> 01:54:58.742
Sir, l think we should send
our boat to Pakistani waters.

01:54:59.021 --> 01:55:00.181
Even l know that.

01:55:00.255 --> 01:55:02.280
But for that we'll
need Government clearance.

01:55:03.726 --> 01:55:04.454
S***

01:55:06.729 --> 01:55:07.753
This one.

01:55:13.235 --> 01:55:14.361
Sir, that's him.

01:55:15.504 --> 01:55:16.232
What?

01:55:16.372 --> 01:55:18.567
Haaris Saeed and Umavi are dead.
- Yes, sir.

01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:21.268
The news reports will be here soon.

01:55:21.343 --> 01:55:27.304
How do you know?
- Sir...our men...killed them.

01:55:29.618 --> 01:55:31.108
Speak up.

01:55:32.187 --> 01:55:35.281
Sir, brother has a white Suzuki car.

01:55:36.225 --> 01:55:37.590
Number.

01:55:40.462 --> 01:55:45.627
LEA 1901 .

01:55:46.602 --> 01:55:49.571
Let me go, l haven't done anything.

01:55:49.738 --> 01:55:52.036
l haven't done anything.

01:55:52.107 --> 01:55:53.369
Who gave you the authority?

01:55:53.442 --> 01:55:55.239
lt's our responsibility
to get him out of there.

01:55:55.310 --> 01:55:58.108
He's one of us.
- No, he's your man.

01:55:58.180 --> 01:55:59.670
You sent him in like Rambo.

01:55:59.748 --> 01:56:02.546
Now get him out yourself...
bloody idiots!

01:56:02.618 --> 01:56:05.587
l must tell the Prime
Minister everything right now.

01:56:05.654 --> 01:56:08.418
But, sir, please listen to me..
- l say get out!

01:56:10.125 --> 01:56:10.682
Yes, sir.

01:56:10.759 --> 01:56:13.125
LEA 1901 .
Yes, sir.

01:56:13.195 --> 01:56:14.389
11 am in the morning.

01:56:14.430 --> 01:56:16.625
Sir, 11 am.
From Lal Kuan checkpoint.

01:56:16.698 --> 01:56:18.427
Send the car number
to Karachi police.

01:56:18.500 --> 01:56:20.024
Let me be blunt, sir.

01:56:20.102 --> 01:56:23.663
Did lndia assassinate Haaris
Saeed and Sabahuddin Umavi?

01:56:23.739 --> 01:56:24.706
No!

01:56:25.607 --> 01:56:29.543
lndia has no connection
with their deaths.

01:56:30.045 --> 01:56:32.605
Let me strongly
reiterate at this point..

01:56:32.681 --> 01:56:35.775
..that lndia does not
believe in vigilante justice.

01:56:36.051 --> 01:56:39.316
The media..
- l have an idea, sir.

01:56:40.422 --> 01:56:41.616
Mr. Roy.

01:56:41.690 --> 01:56:44.056
Sir, Daniyal Khan just called.

01:56:44.159 --> 01:56:47.424
He says he's going to surrender
himself to the Pakistani government..

01:56:47.496 --> 01:56:51.091
..and admit that the lndian government
is behind both the killings.

01:56:51.166 --> 01:56:53.498
Nonsense!
- Sir, Daniyal has threatened to do so.

01:56:53.535 --> 01:56:56.333
He said he'll surrender
in half an hour.

01:56:59.608 --> 01:57:03.738
lf your leave's been approved,
why would we object.

01:57:07.382 --> 01:57:08.474
Stop. Stop.

01:57:11.453 --> 01:57:12.715
Sir. Yes, sir.

01:57:12.788 --> 01:57:14.813
l'll wait for your call.

01:57:15.791 --> 01:57:18.624
Prime Minister's office...
is talking to the Navy.

01:57:19.228 --> 01:57:20.820
So...where are you coming from?

01:57:21.730 --> 01:57:22.628
Yes, sir.

01:57:22.698 --> 01:57:25.599
Show me your license.
- Yes.

01:57:25.667 --> 01:57:31.435
LEA... 1901 .

01:57:32.608 --> 01:57:34.075
Samit.
- Yes, sir.

01:57:34.109 --> 01:57:36.805
There's a navy plane waiting
for you at Palam Air base.

01:57:37.079 --> 01:57:39.479
lt will take you
to Western Naval Base.

01:57:41.216 --> 01:57:41.773
Me?

01:57:42.484 --> 01:57:44.076
The license's made in Lahore.

01:57:44.153 --> 01:57:44.812
Yes.

01:57:45.087 --> 01:57:45.815
Go on.

01:57:46.088 --> 01:57:47.146
Let them through.

01:57:48.557 --> 01:57:50.047
White Suzuki?

01:57:50.559 --> 01:57:52.049
Stop!

01:58:03.539 --> 01:58:06.235
8990!

01:58:08.310 --> 01:58:09.470
Fine, go on.

01:58:09.611 --> 01:58:12.273
Where are you heading?
- Mauripur.

01:58:12.481 --> 01:58:14.574
Take one of our men along.

01:58:14.683 --> 01:58:15.547
Yes.

01:58:15.617 --> 01:58:16.811
Come on, get in.

01:58:19.421 --> 01:58:21.355
Have some shame.
There's a lady inside.

01:58:21.423 --> 01:58:22.617
Sit at the back.

01:58:23.425 --> 01:58:24.483
Get in.

01:58:24.726 --> 01:58:25.624
Sit.

01:58:33.735 --> 01:58:35.202
Go!

01:58:44.446 --> 01:58:47.415
You're brave...done be a fool.

01:58:47.783 --> 01:58:48.647
Come on.

01:58:50.619 --> 01:58:51.483
Come on.

01:58:56.458 --> 01:58:57.516
Come, Khalid!

01:59:28.523 --> 01:59:31.686
l'll sign this. Keep the rest.

01:59:42.571 --> 01:59:43.629
Open this.

01:59:43.739 --> 01:59:45.604
They're getting away.

01:59:45.674 --> 01:59:46.800
Hurry up.

01:59:51.813 --> 01:59:53.804
We'll take you across
Pakistani waters.

01:59:54.082 --> 01:59:56.073
And the lndian navy
will pick you up from there.

01:59:56.151 --> 01:59:57.516
My satellite phone is on.

01:59:58.120 --> 02:00:01.214
They will know our
location and get to you.

02:00:01.823 --> 02:00:03.222
Thank you.

02:00:12.401 --> 02:00:13.663
The car was heading
towards Mauripur.

02:00:13.702 --> 02:00:16.227
l think they're heading
towards Manora jetty.

02:00:16.305 --> 02:00:17.636
They will get out using a boat.

02:00:17.706 --> 02:00:21.198
Alert Naval command to
stop all boats in this area.

02:00:21.276 --> 02:00:22.334
lt will be a big problem, sir.

02:00:22.411 --> 02:00:24.208
Numerous boats leave
from Manora and Mauripur.

02:00:24.279 --> 02:00:25.576
l don't care!

02:00:26.348 --> 02:00:29.749
Stop all the boats
sailing in the water.

02:00:30.385 --> 02:00:31.545
Each one!

02:00:31.620 --> 02:00:33.645
Samit!
- Yes, sir.

02:00:35.557 --> 02:00:36.489
Yes.

02:00:37.392 --> 02:00:38.689
That's the boat's position..

02:00:38.760 --> 02:00:41.058
..which we're getting
through their satellite phone.

02:00:41.129 --> 02:00:41.720
Okay, sir.

02:00:41.763 --> 02:00:44.596
Within 10 minutes this boat
will enter international waters.

02:00:57.379 --> 02:00:58.403
Pakistan Navy!

02:01:06.355 --> 02:01:07.686
Why did it stop?

02:01:12.094 --> 02:01:13.254
Why are you so far
away from the shore?

02:01:13.328 --> 02:01:15.193
We're fishing, sir.

02:01:15.263 --> 02:01:16.525
lt's really difficult these days.

02:01:16.598 --> 02:01:18.293
Check now.
- Okay, sir.

02:01:25.207 --> 02:01:26.469
Check at the back.

02:01:31.246 --> 02:01:32.543
Back there too.

02:01:35.283 --> 02:01:36.614
Were there any other
boats in front of you?

02:01:36.685 --> 02:01:39.153
Don't know,
sir...there are lots of them here.

02:01:39.221 --> 02:01:40.688
The boat's clear, sir.

02:01:45.060 --> 02:01:46.618
l think they've been stopped.

02:01:47.462 --> 02:01:49.123
Both the boats have stopped.

02:01:53.568 --> 02:01:54.535
Sir.

02:01:55.504 --> 02:01:56.732
Turn the light that way.

02:02:13.488 --> 02:02:15.046
Fire that way in the water.

02:02:28.770 --> 02:02:29.702
Dammit.

02:02:30.138 --> 02:02:31.730
The boat is still
in Pakistani waters.

02:02:31.807 --> 02:02:33.331
But we can't go there.

02:02:33.475 --> 02:02:34.533
How far is it?

02:02:34.709 --> 02:02:36.006
Not too far.

02:02:36.244 --> 02:02:39.236
But we don't have
orders to go beyond this.

02:02:39.548 --> 02:02:41.607
They'll have to come
into international waters.

02:02:44.085 --> 02:02:45.484
Stop firing.

02:02:46.087 --> 02:02:47.748
Turn the boat towards Karachi.
- But, sir...

02:02:48.023 --> 02:02:49.251
l said turn it around.

02:02:49.324 --> 02:02:51.292
Follow me.
- Fine, sir.

02:02:51.460 --> 02:02:52.757
Show me your navigation charts.

02:02:55.230 --> 02:02:56.254
Get in.

02:03:03.472 --> 02:03:04.769
Wait a minute.

02:03:05.540 --> 02:03:08.236
Why are they heading
back to Pakistan?

02:03:26.294 --> 02:03:27.261
We'll have to go back.

02:03:38.406 --> 02:03:39.338
Sir they are right here.

02:03:39.407 --> 02:03:40.169
There.

02:03:40.242 --> 02:03:42.073
Daniyal's at the exact
location where the boat stopped.

02:03:42.143 --> 02:03:43.110
We just have to go there.

02:03:43.178 --> 02:03:44.440
l am sorry.

02:03:44.579 --> 02:03:47.343
We don't have orders
to enter Pakistani waters.

02:03:47.482 --> 02:03:49.541
Turn us around, we've to go back.

02:03:50.151 --> 02:03:52.676
Sir, we're just 5
minutes away from him.

02:03:52.754 --> 02:03:54.051
We can't leave him behind.

02:03:54.122 --> 02:03:57.455
l said we don't have permission
to enter Pakistani waters!

02:03:57.626 --> 02:03:59.093
Turn back!

02:03:59.594 --> 02:04:00.788
No!

02:04:08.069 --> 02:04:12.438
Sir...where were you on the
night of 26th November, 2008?

02:04:14.476 --> 02:04:16.205
Where were you that night..

02:04:16.411 --> 02:04:19.778
..when 10 men humiliated
1 billion lndians.

02:04:24.085 --> 02:04:26.349
Wherever you were, l'm sure..

02:04:26.421 --> 02:04:30.323
..even you felt weak,
helpless and humiliated.

02:04:31.726 --> 02:04:35.093
Your blood must have boiled...like
mine, like the entire country.

02:04:38.567 --> 02:04:44.472
This man...
whom we're leaving to die..

02:04:46.141 --> 02:04:48.769
..he single-handedly
killed all those people..

02:04:50.312 --> 02:04:53.281
..who brought lndia
to its knees that day.

02:04:57.152 --> 02:05:01.111
Sir, if we can't
save this man today..

02:05:04.059 --> 02:05:10.259
..then what's the point
of this technology, this power?

02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:13.227
lt's all useless!

02:05:28.450 --> 02:05:31.078
l think we won't have
that tea at the Taj.

02:05:32.220 --> 02:05:33.346
No!

02:05:34.389 --> 02:05:36.983
l'll have tea with you.

02:05:38.660 --> 02:05:41.356
Even if we have to swim all
the way to Mumbai.

02:05:47.602 --> 02:05:49.695
Okay then, Nawaz Mistry...

02:05:52.440 --> 02:05:55.170
...have a cup for me as well.

02:06:08.089 --> 02:06:16.497
''A traveler of the night.''

02:06:18.199 --> 02:06:26.402
''Says goodbye in the morning.''

02:06:28.276 --> 02:06:37.082
''l couldn't be yours
while l was still alive.''

02:06:38.319 --> 02:06:47.284
''But carried out
his duty while dying.''

02:06:47.829 --> 02:06:58.364
''Couldn't be yours...nor
could be yours.''

02:06:58.673 --> 02:07:09.777
''l couldn't endure
this atrocity of love.''

02:09:34.229 --> 02:09:36.561
Do you know why l
agreed to this mission?

02:09:42.136 --> 02:09:46.163
Because l want to see the same respect
in Dilawar Singh's eyes for me.

02:09:51.179 --> 02:09:53.204
l want him to salute me again..

02:09:56.784 --> 02:10:00.049
With the same enthusiasm...
the same passion.

02:10:02.690 --> 02:10:06.649
Ma'am, we're here to
escort you to the base.

02:10:12.800 --> 02:10:15.792
Can you take me somewhere else?

02:10:28.583 --> 02:10:33.111
This is the same place that
was attacked on 26/11 ..

02:10:33.187 --> 02:10:35.178
People have gathered here
today in thousands

02:10:35.256 --> 02:10:39.124
First morning after the
masterminds of 26/11 were killed.

02:10:39.193 --> 02:10:40.319
Around here are
the people of Mumbai..

02:10:40.395 --> 02:10:41.726
..who are here to pay
condolence to the victims.

02:10:41.796 --> 02:10:44.060
People from all over the
city are gathering around here..

02:10:44.132 --> 02:10:46.259
..to express their happiness.

02:10:46.334 --> 02:10:47.562
How do you feel?

02:10:47.635 --> 02:10:49.660
God has given us justice.

02:10:49.737 --> 02:10:52.365
But we should've
killed those murderers.

02:11:19.600 --> 02:11:21.431
Here's a cup tea, dear?

02:11:23.838 --> 02:11:25.237
But l don't have money.

02:11:25.306 --> 02:11:26.671
lt's alright.

02:11:26.808 --> 02:11:29.174
l am not charging anyone today.

02:11:29.277 --> 02:11:30.244
Take it.

02:11:36.751 --> 02:11:40.710
My son worked at
the Taj as a waiter.

02:11:41.589 --> 02:11:44.558
That night they killed him too.

02:11:45.593 --> 02:11:49.461
Today when l learned that those
murderers have been killed...

02:11:49.530 --> 02:11:55.025
..it felt like my son's
soul attained peace.

02:11:55.370 --> 02:11:58.134
So l won't charge anyone today.
Yes.

02:12:01.709 --> 02:12:03.677
Uncle..
- Yes.

02:12:04.746 --> 02:12:06.145
Can l get another cup of tea?

02:12:06.214 --> 02:12:08.148
Of course.

02:12:08.616 --> 02:12:10.140
Here.

02:12:10.451 --> 02:12:11.748
Thank you.
