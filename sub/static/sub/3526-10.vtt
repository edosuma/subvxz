01:50.810 --> 01:54.610
Tony, hey.
l tented the bulbs.

01:54.647 --> 01:57.081
Oh, good.

01:57.117 --> 02:00.382
l've been meaning
to ask you...

02:00.420 --> 02:02.251
The Sacrimonis--

02:02.288 --> 02:05.485
l've been doin' his yard
over there a year and change now...

02:05.525 --> 02:07.015
And?

02:07.060 --> 02:08.687
l guess
what l'm asking is

02:08.728 --> 02:12.494
how much longer do l have
to keep doin' this on the arm?

02:13.600 --> 02:15.568
Oh, so it was okay
when we were gettin' you

02:15.602 --> 02:17.399
out of your Feech La Manna problem, huh?

02:17.437 --> 02:19.268
But suddenly--
short fuckin' memory?

02:19.305 --> 02:21.535
l appreciate that, Tony.
Don't get me wrong, but--

02:21.574 --> 02:23.667
You're a selfish prick, Sal.
You know that?

02:23.710 --> 02:26.270
Her husband's in jail.
Don't you think this is the time

02:26.312 --> 02:28.712
when Mrs. Sacrimoni
needs you the most?

02:36.756 --> 02:38.986
The federal prosecutors
and myself have been told

02:39.025 --> 02:41.118
to clear our calendars
for the next five months.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.254
So trial is upon us.

02:43.296 --> 02:45.423
And the feds have reached

02:45.465 --> 02:47.490
a complete accounting
of your worth.

02:50.703 --> 02:53.467
''The vintage Wurlitzer''?

02:53.506 --> 02:55.440
They go through
my fuckin' sock drawer?

02:55.475 --> 02:57.443
They shot a video
the day of your arrest.

02:57.477 --> 02:59.445
They even tracked down
the 180 grand

02:59.479 --> 03:01.845
in Boca Raton
under your father's name.

03:01.881 --> 03:04.247
They estimate
your net worth at $5 million...

03:05.385 --> 03:07.717
While Ginny lives
on scraps.

03:07.754 --> 03:09.688
...between your cash
and portfolios

03:09.722 --> 03:11.417
with Fidelity and Vanguard,

03:11.457 --> 03:15.154
your 401k and severance parachute
from Essany Scaffolding,

03:15.195 --> 03:17.686
condo in Deal Beach
at 450,

03:17.730 --> 03:19.721
Maserati, Ginny's Yukon,

03:19.766 --> 03:22.360
and the house and its contents
valued at a million two.

03:22.402 --> 03:25.064
ls this all part
of your plan, Ron--

03:25.104 --> 03:28.130
make me so fuckin' depressed
that l hang myself?

03:28.174 --> 03:32.076
lt's my obligation to raise the idea
again of cooperating.

03:33.079 --> 03:35.274
Flip?

03:35.315 --> 03:38.250
Let me explain something
to you again, Ron,

03:38.284 --> 03:40.184
but differently.

03:40.220 --> 03:43.155
Being a rat,
where l'm comin' from,

03:43.189 --> 03:45.657
that's like asking a person
where you're comin' from

03:45.692 --> 03:47.853
to become a fuckin' Nazi.

03:47.894 --> 03:51.193
l don't wanna hear
that shit again.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.028
Good.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.466
Because, frankly,
l don't represent turncoats.

03:57.770 --> 04:01.331
'Cause it would kill
your practice.

04:10.984 --> 04:12.952
Huh...

04:15.088 --> 04:18.353
What happened
to my stuffed pork loin?

04:18.391 --> 04:20.552
You ever hear
of knocking?

04:20.593 --> 04:22.220
l ordered it special.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.322
You had them send it up
to Carmela?

04:25.365 --> 04:27.629
You get
what you pay for.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.999
Hi.

04:32.472 --> 04:35.373
She's your little twin.

04:35.408 --> 04:37.433
Bacala's got
no fuckin' genes at all.

04:37.477 --> 04:40.776
You never miss a chance
to shit on him, do you?

04:40.813 --> 04:43.543
l'm joking, come on.
She looks like you, that's all.

04:43.583 --> 04:45.278
l don't know why you
just can't admit

04:45.318 --> 04:47.513
that you blame us
that you got shot.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.851
Unfortunately, l have
only myself to blame.

04:53.893 --> 04:55.986
''Unfortunately.'' Oh.

04:56.029 --> 04:59.556
So obviously you'd like
to blame somebody.

05:00.733 --> 05:02.997
l have only myself
to blame.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.095
You don't blame me
for the shooting?

05:05.138 --> 05:07.038
Well you fuckin'
blame me for something!

05:07.073 --> 05:09.974
- Jan, the baby.
- You know, marrying the boss's sister--

05:10.009 --> 05:12.443
usually it's a step up.

05:12.478 --> 05:16.073
But you keep your
goddamn foot on our necks.

05:16.115 --> 05:18.811
You punish Bobby
because he's my husband.

05:18.851 --> 05:22.947
- Will you stop, huh?
- To be his age and not to be a captain?

05:22.989 --> 05:26.049
Oh, now l see what this
little visit's all about.

05:26.092 --> 05:27.957
He works so hard
for you,

05:27.994 --> 05:29.723
and what does he get?

05:29.762 --> 05:31.593
Merciless ridicule--

05:31.631 --> 05:34.031
about his weight,
about his model railroading.

05:34.067 --> 05:37.036
- He's a grown man!
- Oh, but it's okay for Neil Young.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.867
He owns Lionel!

05:40.606 --> 05:44.064
Domenica! Take care
of your things.

05:45.511 --> 05:47.945
l don't know
where it comes from--

05:47.980 --> 05:51.575
all your anger,
your hate for me.

05:51.617 --> 05:53.949
l'm your sister.

05:55.321 --> 05:58.290
l know
l'm not perfect.

05:58.324 --> 06:00.724
l know
l annoy people.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.554
l think about you

06:05.598 --> 06:07.429
lying in that
hospital bed...

06:09.769 --> 06:12.067
l cried for you.

06:12.105 --> 06:13.936
l sat with you.

06:23.015 --> 06:24.539
l know it.

06:25.918 --> 06:28.910
And l appreciated it.

06:31.758 --> 06:34.886
But we both know

06:34.927 --> 06:38.624
no matter
how much help l gave,

06:38.664 --> 06:41.690
you'd still be here
fuckin' complainin'.

06:41.734 --> 06:43.201
Oh my God,

06:43.236 --> 06:47.673
there's nothing holding us together but
DNA.

07:00.887 --> 07:03.447
l'm askin' what else you got
besides slot machines?

07:05.691 --> 07:08.888
That single-deck
blackjack?

07:08.928 --> 07:11.055
Okay, thanks.

07:23.910 --> 07:25.707
l can't believe this.

07:25.745 --> 07:28.077
- l was--
- ls this what you're doing all day?

07:28.114 --> 07:31.140
l knew there was a reason you wouldn't
let me read the galleys of your book.

07:31.184 --> 07:32.674
l'm doing research.

07:32.718 --> 07:35.016
l guess Rocky Marciano
was a fan of the greyhounds

07:35.054 --> 07:38.046
'cause l found a fucking
trifecta box ticket in my trash!

07:42.595 --> 07:44.586
Hold up.

07:44.630 --> 07:47.190
lt's complicated shit.

07:47.233 --> 07:49.360
Are you even
a sportswriter?

07:49.402 --> 07:52.803
l mean, here we are talking about taking
the next step in this relationship.

07:52.839 --> 07:56.775
l ask you to share my home and you
can't even be straight with me.

07:56.809 --> 07:59.471
Fuck this.
Nice knowing you, Vincent.

07:59.512 --> 08:01.605
Jimbo, come on.

08:07.019 --> 08:09.886
l'm not
a writer, okay?

08:09.922 --> 08:12.914
l'm not
from Scottsdale

08:12.959 --> 08:16.053
and the car's
not my sister's.

08:16.095 --> 08:18.120
l'm actually
from New Jersey

08:18.164 --> 08:20.291
- l knew it.
- Some shit went down.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.164
l had to leave--

08:22.201 --> 08:25.329
my home,
my contracting business...

08:26.906 --> 08:28.373
my wife, my kids.

08:28.407 --> 08:31.069
Are you drunk?
lt's not even 11 :00!

08:31.110 --> 08:33.078
You think it's easy?

08:33.111 --> 08:35.205
l miss home so bad
my heart's a fuckin' lump.

08:35.248 --> 08:37.182
l'm barely holding
together,

08:37.216 --> 08:39.342
stuck in the sticks,
running out of money

08:39.385 --> 08:41.352
and now this?

08:41.386 --> 08:43.787
You think l was
looking for you?

08:46.225 --> 08:48.193
A wife and kids.
Of course.

08:48.227 --> 08:50.058
l've been divorced
for a few years.

08:50.096 --> 08:51.825
Where do they think
you are?

08:51.864 --> 08:55.891
You can never
tell anybody, ever.

08:55.935 --> 08:58.927
l'm not
fuckin' around here.

08:58.971 --> 09:01.201
l was married too,
remember?

09:01.240 --> 09:05.176
l was only gonna say
you need some money,

09:05.211 --> 09:08.874
you worked construction--
maybe l can help you get work.

09:08.915 --> 09:11.679
l know some people could always
use a good handyman.

09:17.390 --> 09:20.188
Happy birthday!

09:20.226 --> 09:22.694
- Mwah!
- Stop blubbering. lt's a party.

09:22.728 --> 09:26.061
You think we'd let you
turn 50 alone?

09:26.098 --> 09:28.123
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

09:30.603 --> 09:33.299
Hi, Sal!

09:35.274 --> 09:37.242
God, he's such a mope.

09:37.276 --> 09:39.744
The girls come around
enough, and that helps.

09:39.779 --> 09:42.805
Allegra's a little bitchy,
but it's painful for her to be here.

09:42.848 --> 09:45.043
Plus she thinks
l resent her happiness.

09:45.084 --> 09:47.109
- Newlyweds.
- She's probably freaked out

09:47.153 --> 09:48.677
that she's not
happier herself.

09:48.721 --> 09:52.384
Ginny, that kitchen...

09:52.425 --> 09:54.086
and this room,
the light...

09:54.126 --> 09:56.060
Not his decision
to make.

09:56.095 --> 09:57.653
l'm running that shop,
not him.

09:57.697 --> 10:00.097
My days are
completely full.

10:00.132 --> 10:02.157
- l shouldn't.
- Hey, it's your birthday.

10:04.470 --> 10:08.065
- Yeah.
- l've always loved this place.

10:08.107 --> 10:10.837
lt reminds me
of the Palladian villas l saw in ltaly.

10:10.876 --> 10:12.969
Thank you.
Sometimes l forget.

10:13.012 --> 10:15.640
And it's embarrassing.
l spend most of my time upstairs.

10:15.681 --> 10:18.115
- Wellbutrin.
- l wish there was a pill--

10:18.150 --> 10:19.617
John in that place?

10:19.652 --> 10:22.018
Of course l can't say
my pain's worse than anybody's.

10:22.054 --> 10:25.023
Yeah yeah.
We're both grownups.

10:25.057 --> 10:27.787
l'd rather go
with my own instincts.

10:49.315 --> 10:53.012
Your feet are like
fuckin' icicles.

10:53.052 --> 10:54.576
Hands too?

10:56.889 --> 10:59.016
Dinner was good.

10:59.058 --> 11:00.753
Shh.

11:24.817 --> 11:27.615
Hey, l found
a woodland mountain.

11:27.653 --> 11:32.113
27'' peak,
clump foliage and snow.

11:34.060 --> 11:36.551
- Bobby.
- l'm listening, okay?

11:37.630 --> 11:39.530
Where are you going?

11:39.565 --> 11:42.728
Rafe's brother's making a music video.
They got dry ice.

11:42.768 --> 11:44.861
Where's your helmet?

11:46.539 --> 11:48.530
Check out
the Moe and Joe action.

11:51.444 --> 11:54.242
Hey, you know what?
Let's do a race,

11:54.280 --> 11:56.180
the Polar Express one.

11:56.215 --> 11:57.910
We could trash it.

11:59.518 --> 12:01.748
l can't.

12:12.431 --> 12:15.764
l see the gray cloud
hanging around your head.

12:17.369 --> 12:20.167
Where's Prince Albert?
Still sleeping?

12:20.206 --> 12:22.174
Who knows?

12:25.845 --> 12:29.611
Tony, l've been very patient with you
because you've been sick.

12:29.648 --> 12:33.448
You were going to talk
to the building inspector.

12:33.486 --> 12:36.751
- My spec house.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah yeah.

12:36.789 --> 12:39.314
l sent Little Paulie.

12:39.358 --> 12:42.156
They made some headway
with the supervisor,

12:42.194 --> 12:46.096
but the other guy,
the inspector, he's a piece of work.

12:46.132 --> 12:48.123
Next l'll get Sil
on it.

12:51.670 --> 12:54.867
Gotta pay a visit to the Montville
building department.

12:56.175 --> 12:57.904
To what end?

12:57.943 --> 13:00.969
l've been promising Carm
l'd lean on this inspector.

13:01.013 --> 13:03.982
Completely went
out of my head.

13:04.016 --> 13:07.850
The guy's name is,
uh, Ron Senkowski.

13:11.724 --> 13:13.487
Ginny Sack's brother,
Anthony.

13:18.030 --> 13:20.328
Ah, the lord
of the lenses.

13:20.366 --> 13:23.199
Actually we just started
carrying these.

13:23.235 --> 13:26.204
The newest
Cross pen.

13:32.611 --> 13:35.011
Ah...

13:35.047 --> 13:36.639
a rollerball.

13:36.682 --> 13:38.149
You want
a classic fountain?

13:38.184 --> 13:41.153
Nah.
Have a seat.

13:42.621 --> 13:44.680
So how's your
brother-in-law?

13:44.723 --> 13:46.588
John's fuckin'
made of steel.

13:49.728 --> 13:53.323
l was told
''your ears only.''

13:53.365 --> 13:55.356
Oh, that's why
he didn't get a pen?

13:55.401 --> 13:57.961
- No, l--
- He's fuckin' with you, Anthony.

14:09.014 --> 14:10.208
Johnny's a silent partner

14:10.249 --> 14:12.683
in this heavy equipment
leasing thing in New Orleans.

14:12.718 --> 14:17.382
Good. FEMA's down there
handing out Krugerrands in buckets.

14:17.423 --> 14:20.187
He said post-Katrina you had some
knowledge of business in the area.

14:20.226 --> 14:22.387
Well, let me say this--

14:22.428 --> 14:25.795
Dick Cheney for President...
of the fuckin' universe.

14:27.066 --> 14:31.901
On account of John's, uh, liquidity
problems--

14:31.937 --> 14:33.529
the asset freeze--

14:33.572 --> 14:35.733
he'd love you
to contact these brothers--

14:35.774 --> 14:38.402
the owners--
and turn it into cash.

14:38.444 --> 14:39.843
Me?

14:39.879 --> 14:41.574
Says Phil Leotardo
shouldn't be involved.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.844
Just know John's
asking as a friend.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.047
And obviously
there's a finder's fee.

15:19.852 --> 15:21.615
What the hell's this,
a siesta?

15:21.654 --> 15:24.885
What?
l wasn't sleeping.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.654
l was resting my hips.

15:27.693 --> 15:30.526
l'm supposed
to have surgery.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.327
Am l early?

15:35.367 --> 15:38.825
- What do you mean?
- Dinner.

15:38.871 --> 15:42.705
l am interviewing
a new contractor for my spec--

15:42.741 --> 15:45.141
Bill DeGillio.

15:45.177 --> 15:47.145
He built
the Sacrimoni house.

15:47.179 --> 15:50.615
He did decent workmanship.
Ginny says he works for a price.

15:50.649 --> 15:53.413
- So?
- Well, your sister loves that house.

15:53.452 --> 15:56.182
She said it reminded her
of a ''villa in ltaly.''

15:57.556 --> 15:59.046
What, is he
coming here now?

15:59.091 --> 16:01.821
l picked up a couple of sandwiches
from ltalianissimo.

16:12.338 --> 16:14.966
You know, your father
did this house

16:15.007 --> 16:18.067
and it was more than
decent workmanship.

16:24.616 --> 16:27.050
You think about replacing
him before you rush off

16:27.086 --> 16:30.180
into something that could maybe cost
you a lot more of your time.

16:32.358 --> 16:34.986
Why do you suddenly care
so much about my dad?

16:42.501 --> 16:45.561
And l like that she has
these little projects

16:45.604 --> 16:48.903
and charities,
what-have-you.

16:48.941 --> 16:50.738
Makes her happy,

16:50.776 --> 16:53.142
keeps her busy.

16:53.178 --> 16:55.942
But...

16:55.981 --> 16:57.972
even in bed she's
a million miles away.

17:00.285 --> 17:03.550
Sounds like you want
to encourage her with this house

17:03.589 --> 17:06.285
as long as it doesn't interfere
with your life.

17:07.593 --> 17:10.425
Carmela
and me, we--

17:10.462 --> 17:11.929
we came
to an understanding

17:11.964 --> 17:15.559
when we reconciled--

17:15.601 --> 17:17.830
l would financially
back her spec house

17:17.869 --> 17:22.671
and she would have more
of a don't-ask-don't-tell policy

17:22.708 --> 17:24.573
towards my work

17:24.609 --> 17:27.840
and my recreational life
outside of the home.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.848
But you tell me
there hasn't been

17:29.882 --> 17:32.248
much recreating
since the shooting.

17:32.284 --> 17:34.479
No, and that's okay.

17:49.134 --> 17:51.432
Fucking Janice came
to visit me at work.

17:51.470 --> 17:53.563
That doesn't
happen often.

17:53.605 --> 17:55.630
Well, she shops
for meat there.

17:55.674 --> 17:57.733
We get it free.

17:57.776 --> 18:00.040
And by the way, again,
if you ever need a roast

18:00.079 --> 18:02.707
or any specialty
kind of cut,

18:02.748 --> 18:04.409
please just ask.

18:06.919 --> 18:10.548
My dad used to
drop us off there

18:10.589 --> 18:12.318
when he had
to run errands.

18:12.357 --> 18:14.587
We'd go into the back
and we'd steal cigarettes,

18:14.626 --> 18:17.026
play house, you know,
shit like that.

18:18.464 --> 18:20.056
Anyway, she was
all upset.

18:20.099 --> 18:23.796
She said that
l was mean to her

18:23.836 --> 18:25.997
and her husband.

18:26.038 --> 18:29.098
- What did you say?
- Well, it doesn't matter,

18:29.141 --> 18:31.109
'cause she's right.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.443
l love it when l can
take a shit on her

18:34.480 --> 18:36.448
and her husband.

18:36.482 --> 18:38.109
What's that about?

18:38.150 --> 18:41.051
Even when they told me
that Uncle Jun' might need diapers,

18:41.086 --> 18:43.714
l thought about Bobby
having to change him--

18:43.755 --> 18:45.916
l still get
a kick out of it.

18:47.326 --> 18:50.420
lt makes Bob seem weak?

18:50.462 --> 18:52.623
Your sister too?

18:52.664 --> 18:56.327
These are acts
of kindness.

18:56.368 --> 18:58.700
Janice only does
''acts of Janice.''

18:58.737 --> 19:00.500
Trust me.

19:00.539 --> 19:03.872
You two have never
really gotten along?

19:03.909 --> 19:05.900
Well, not never.
She was my older sister.

19:05.944 --> 19:08.174
l thought
she was pretty cool.

19:08.213 --> 19:09.874
And she gave it back
to my mother.

19:09.915 --> 19:11.940
Let me tell you,
that was some heroic shit.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.713
Because she
defended you.

19:13.752 --> 19:16.846
Please. lt was
every man for himself.

19:18.991 --> 19:22.449
l remember one time
my parents left her in charge.

19:27.399 --> 19:29.230
Go ahead.

19:31.203 --> 19:34.604
Well, she stood in the hallway
and she tape-recorded

19:34.640 --> 19:37.336
me and Barb
having a fight.

19:38.911 --> 19:42.005
And she held that cassette tape
over my head for a month.

19:43.982 --> 19:46.712
Fuckin' extortion.

19:46.752 --> 19:50.017
Made me make her bed,
get her shit.

19:50.055 --> 19:52.023
Did she do that
to Barbara too?

19:52.057 --> 19:55.254
Well, that's not
the fuckin' point.

19:55.294 --> 19:57.819
l've been coming here--
l don't know-- five years now

19:57.863 --> 20:01.424
and you still don't understand what
it means to tape somebody in my family?

20:01.466 --> 20:04.435
You still don't fucking
get this?

20:04.469 --> 20:07.404
Listen, as far
as that thing goes--

20:07.439 --> 20:10.408
the coffee
with the chicory--

20:12.911 --> 20:15.675
- What the fuck is that?
- Oh shit.

20:15.714 --> 20:19.206
l suck at talking like this, John.
l'm sorry.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.914
Our friend with
the stomach.

20:24.289 --> 20:27.019
ln town
or near home?

20:27.059 --> 20:28.924
Your neighbor.

20:30.729 --> 20:32.629
- A.S.--
- Yeah, all right.

20:32.664 --> 20:34.529
Just say, ''the thing
l asked you to do.''

20:34.566 --> 20:36.659
''The coffee with
the fuckin' chicory.''

20:39.037 --> 20:41.062
- ls he gonna get it for me?
- Yes.

20:41.106 --> 20:44.667
Bad news is he wants
10 cups for himself.

20:44.710 --> 20:48.009
Not seven.

20:48.046 --> 20:50.310
All right. Done.

20:55.220 --> 20:58.781
Did you pick up the birthday cake
for Gin with the marzipan flowers?

20:59.858 --> 21:01.416
The stuff behind
the pool?

21:01.460 --> 21:04.361
No, an actual
fuckin' cake.

21:05.364 --> 21:07.559
lt's her birthday.

21:25.183 --> 21:27.481
- What are you doing?
- l'm comin' with you.

21:29.087 --> 21:31.885
Okay, but stand clear.

21:35.060 --> 21:37.494
- What's going on?
- Pastor heard water running,

21:37.529 --> 21:40.327
went down, basement's flooded and
they're trying to shut down the pipe.

21:40.365 --> 21:42.299
But the pastor's trapped,
standing on a milk crate.

21:42.334 --> 21:44.529
- Anybody go get him?
- There's an arcing wire hanging.

21:44.569 --> 21:47.595
These assholes skipped a conduit
when they remodeled.

21:47.639 --> 21:49.106
l spent years
as a contractor.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.166
Electrical is where
l got started.

22:06.491 --> 22:09.324
Way to go, Vince!

22:10.996 --> 22:12.793
What the fuck
did l tell you?

22:12.831 --> 22:14.731
Fuck you. The guy was gonna
get cooked.

22:14.766 --> 22:16.393
What are you trying
to be, a big man?

22:16.435 --> 22:18.460
- Back the fuck off!
- What the fuck, Jim?

22:18.503 --> 22:20.994
Boys, boys,
calm down.

22:21.039 --> 22:23.974
Okay, now let's cut the bullshit,
get the water turned off

22:24.009 --> 22:27.035
and pump out
the damn basement.

22:31.016 --> 22:34.577
l gotta say, l thought you guys
were morons for doing this shit,

22:34.619 --> 22:37.213
but now l can see
it's a fuckin' rush.

22:37.255 --> 22:38.813
You should join the department.
That would be good.

22:38.857 --> 22:41.189
We could use
another moron.

22:41.226 --> 22:43.751
Of course it's a commitment,
firefighting.

22:43.795 --> 22:45.160
Every day
it's there.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.597
You have to have
a passion, really.

22:47.632 --> 22:50.567
l've got these bad hips.
Supposed to have surgery.

22:50.602 --> 22:53.002
Well, this is all
bullshit talk anyway.

22:53.038 --> 22:55.063
You're probably gonna
forget this craphole

22:55.107 --> 22:57.337
the minute you hear
from your publisher.

22:59.211 --> 23:02.374
Hey, darts! Five bucks a point.
Who's in?

23:03.882 --> 23:06.043
Nah. lt's almost
midnight.

23:06.084 --> 23:08.143
Where the fuck
you guys going?

23:08.186 --> 23:10.746
- Let's play some poker.
- Hey, you did great.

23:10.789 --> 23:12.984
Back where l come from
the night's just startin'.

23:13.024 --> 23:14.958
Good night.

23:18.630 --> 23:21.895
Good week, even with
the fuckin' Dolphins.

23:24.202 --> 23:25.829
Night, boss.

23:33.945 --> 23:35.879
Get his joint.

23:35.914 --> 23:37.279
You know
who the fuck l am?

23:37.315 --> 23:38.714
You beat, nigga.
What?

23:38.750 --> 23:41.048
You come out the bookie's?
You a winner or a loser?

23:41.086 --> 23:43.884
You're making
a big mistake.

23:46.158 --> 23:47.625
Damn! Three Gs.

23:48.627 --> 23:52.586
You got what you want.
Please don't. l got kids.

23:52.631 --> 23:54.121
Yo man,
look at his mouth.

23:54.166 --> 23:55.463
Look at his fuckin' mouth!

23:55.500 --> 23:56.933
Fuck this. Do him.
Do him now.

23:56.968 --> 23:59.766
Jesus, no. Please.
No, please.

24:01.139 --> 24:02.163
Shit!

24:02.207 --> 24:04.835
What the fuck are you doing, man?
Why you pull that trigger?

24:09.981 --> 24:13.212
Well, according to John,
the retail value of Bayou Leasing

24:13.251 --> 24:16.243
is around six mil.
Seem about right?

24:16.288 --> 24:18.688
- Between five and six.
- Let's do this again, chere.

24:20.392 --> 24:24.328
Well, you're gonna have to find a buyer
and deliver John's half to me

24:24.362 --> 24:27.957
and in about 30 days, give you a chance
to get a couple of bidders.

24:27.999 --> 24:30.627
- His half?
- Yeah.

24:30.669 --> 24:33.194
l don't think
that's up for debate.

24:33.238 --> 24:35.502
Had you controlled
your fuckin' football jones

24:35.540 --> 24:37.838
we wouldn't even have
no fuckin' silent partner.

24:37.876 --> 24:41.312
That man floated me
50 grand. 50.

24:41.346 --> 24:44.406
Next thing l know he's
buying in for half a fucking million.

24:44.449 --> 24:47.941
Look at him sitting there
like they don't do this shit every day.

24:47.986 --> 24:51.717
You took John's loan.
He helped you expand.

24:51.756 --> 24:53.690
Now it's time
to cash in.

24:53.725 --> 24:57.217
Listen, Mr. Soprano, that's what
l've been saying all along.

24:59.564 --> 25:01.691
You know, you two
don't seem like brothers.

25:01.733 --> 25:04.930
ln-laws. He married
my little sis.

25:04.970 --> 25:06.835
15 years
of womanly company

25:06.872 --> 25:10.171
but l had to come all the way
to New Jersey to get truly fucked.

25:14.045 --> 25:16.570
You know, l'm doing this
as a favor to John.

25:16.615 --> 25:18.480
And l don't need
another headache.

25:18.517 --> 25:19.984
So do we got
a problem here?

25:20.018 --> 25:22.452
No, sir.
l'm buying a boat.

25:24.723 --> 25:27.351
Now you fancy yourself
a businessman.

25:27.392 --> 25:31.328
Would you sell now with all that money
pouring into New Orleans?

25:31.363 --> 25:33.854
John Sacrimoni
asked me to.

25:33.899 --> 25:36.367
Well, we're
very different people.

26:02.060 --> 26:05.621
- Ahem-- yeah.
- Heard about Bobby Bacala?

26:05.664 --> 26:09.100
Yeah, my sister called
with the breaking news.

26:09.134 --> 26:11.762
That fuckin' part
of Newark--

26:11.803 --> 26:13.737
even the cops
don't go there no more.

26:13.772 --> 26:16.639
So you heard
everything.

26:16.675 --> 26:19.838
Doctors said the slug blew bits
of sidewalk into the eye there.

26:19.878 --> 26:21.539
Yeah, l heard.

26:21.580 --> 26:24.743
- But they're optimistic.
- Right, doctors.

26:24.783 --> 26:27.946
lt's always good news
till it ain't.

26:27.986 --> 26:30.614
Speaking of that, whatever the fuck
happened to you

26:30.655 --> 26:32.623
with the prostate?

26:32.657 --> 26:37.060
Well actually, T,
l've been dealing with some shit.

26:37.095 --> 26:38.756
Cancer, to tell
you the truth.

26:41.266 --> 26:42.824
What the fuck, Paulie?

26:42.867 --> 26:45.267
lt was early.
Maybe l caught a break.

26:45.303 --> 26:47.498
Still encapsulated.

26:47.539 --> 26:49.507
l'm taking a course
of radiation

26:49.541 --> 26:52.237
to knock the PSA back
into the single digits.

26:52.277 --> 26:56.338
Well, are you all right?
The hair and shit?

26:56.381 --> 26:59.976
Heh, knock wood, eh?

27:00.018 --> 27:02.043
l must have done
good things in my life.

27:02.087 --> 27:03.987
Yeah.

27:06.925 --> 27:08.256
All right.

27:08.293 --> 27:09.760
The cancer--

27:09.794 --> 27:11.785
your ears only.

27:11.830 --> 27:13.491
Absolutely.

27:17.168 --> 27:18.897
You hear
about Bobby?

27:18.937 --> 27:20.564
- Yeah.
- Should've seen him.

27:20.605 --> 27:22.835
Put a patch over his eye
like Hathaway.

27:22.874 --> 27:24.899
He was
really rattled.

27:24.943 --> 27:28.276
Still, let's face it, it was kind
of stupid to be out there that late.

27:28.313 --> 27:30.873
Ton', cops don't even
go there no more.

27:30.915 --> 27:33.941
Anyway, Bobby's vision's
fucked now.

27:33.985 --> 27:35.748
They're hoping
the repair will take.

27:35.787 --> 27:38.051
He could be a candidate
for a cornea transplant.

27:38.089 --> 27:40.649
He should be a candidate
for a brain transplant.

27:40.692 --> 27:42.660
To his credit,

27:42.694 --> 27:45.720
all he was thinking about
was straightening out for the week.

27:45.764 --> 27:48.824
Fuck that ''honor
and loyalty'' shit.

27:48.867 --> 27:50.858
lt was
a maneuver, Carlo,

27:50.902 --> 27:53.336
'cause he knew it was
his own fucking fault.

28:02.614 --> 28:04.138
What?

28:04.182 --> 28:05.945
Don't give me
that look.

28:09.020 --> 28:13.013
lncluding
the wife's lRA

28:13.058 --> 28:16.653
and his pension,

28:16.695 --> 28:20.096
we'd go
for 240 months.

28:20.131 --> 28:24.431
20 years and 90/%
of his assets?

28:24.469 --> 28:26.528
Makes trial seem like
a risk worth taking.

28:26.571 --> 28:28.505
Have you seen
the discovery evidence?

28:28.540 --> 28:30.201
You came to us.

28:30.241 --> 28:33.210
My client insisted
the house is off-limits.

28:33.244 --> 28:35.804
He wants his wife
provided for.

28:35.847 --> 28:37.337
So what do you have
in mind?

28:37.382 --> 28:41.614
Renee, again, the shit
that has nothing to do with him:

28:41.653 --> 28:44.952
the house, her lRA,
the Yukon,

28:44.989 --> 28:48.015
the deed
on the daughter's condo.

28:48.059 --> 28:51.256
- And 1 2 years.
- For a conspiracy to commit murder?

28:51.296 --> 28:54.163
Get back to me
when you're sober, Ron.

29:04.142 --> 29:06.736
lt's broken.
Wanna switch?

29:06.778 --> 29:10.145
Oh no no.
l'm good.

29:10.181 --> 29:13.844
Carm just called. She's still
getting her folks in the car.

29:13.885 --> 29:15.284
Where's Barb
and Tom?

29:15.320 --> 29:16.947
l asked them
to bring wine.

29:16.988 --> 29:19.513
We'll see
how long that takes.

29:19.557 --> 29:21.650
Did you take
the Vicodin?

29:31.169 --> 29:33.637
Giants, huh?

29:33.671 --> 29:35.764
Fucking blowing 'em out.

29:35.807 --> 29:37.775
As long as they
don't beat the spread.

29:40.011 --> 29:42.275
- Where are you going?
- Out.

29:42.313 --> 29:44.440
The Giants
are kicking ass here.

29:44.482 --> 29:46.882
l'm going to Eric's
to watch the Chargers.

29:46.918 --> 29:49.079
- What channel's that on?
- Some people aren't too cheap

29:49.120 --> 29:50.610
to buy the satellite package.

29:50.655 --> 29:52.953
Sit down.
This is a Giants house.

29:52.991 --> 29:56.688
- l hate the fucking Giants.
- Ho! What'd we say about that language?

29:56.728 --> 29:58.719
AJ didn't have
to come to Sunday dinner.

29:58.763 --> 30:02.255
AJ has a job.
Do you wanna go get a job?

30:02.300 --> 30:04.268
Go ahead.

30:04.302 --> 30:06.031
But first go get
your last report card

30:06.070 --> 30:08.300
and read it out loud
to everybody.

30:14.245 --> 30:17.180
No? l thought so.

30:17.215 --> 30:19.911
Now go finish
your Spanish report before dinner.

30:21.853 --> 30:23.650
Set the table,
honey.

30:31.296 --> 30:34.561
My brother-in-law
almost got his fucking eye put out.

30:34.599 --> 30:36.965
Some fucking
crackhead animals.

30:37.001 --> 30:40.266
- That is terrible.
- Yeah, it is, but...

30:40.305 --> 30:43.172
Jesus Christ, it's one thing
after another with her family.

30:43.208 --> 30:45.005
You mean
the bad luck?

30:45.043 --> 30:48.137
Or do you feel like
somehow they deserve it?

30:48.179 --> 30:51.444
l don't know, but...

30:51.482 --> 30:53.973
fucking Janice
attracts drama.

30:54.018 --> 30:57.181
She creams
over the misery.

30:57.222 --> 30:59.884
Does she remind you
of anyone?

31:03.361 --> 31:06.194
When we were growing up,
she had something, you know?

31:06.231 --> 31:07.630
She--

31:07.665 --> 31:10.566
she had beautiful hair
and she was built and...

31:14.172 --> 31:16.299
Guys her age were always
buying me ice cream,

31:16.341 --> 31:18.275
giving me baseball cards,
kissing my ass

31:18.309 --> 31:20.436
to get in good
with her.

31:22.614 --> 31:25.344
Sounds a little
like jealousy.

31:25.383 --> 31:27.908
No guy wants his sister
to be the town pump.

31:27.952 --> 31:30.147
You weren't
sexually threatened?

31:32.323 --> 31:35.520
Oh, Jesus Christ, will you make up
your fucking sick mind?

31:35.560 --> 31:37.892
First it's my mother.
Now l wanna fuck my sister?

31:37.929 --> 31:41.330
lt's normal,
not sick,

31:41.366 --> 31:43.357
that she functioned

31:43.401 --> 31:46.962
as the focus of your
early sexual feelings.

31:47.005 --> 31:50.065
ln fact, it was
probably mutual.

31:50.108 --> 31:51.939
Oh, Jesus Christ.

31:51.976 --> 31:54.206
You describe her
as ''built.''

31:54.245 --> 31:58.181
All those afternoons in your father's
office, ''playing house.''

32:00.218 --> 32:02.118
Whatever your bond,

32:02.153 --> 32:05.418
what happened
between then and now?

32:07.525 --> 32:11.291
She fought it out
with my mother and finally took off

32:11.329 --> 32:13.923
first minute
she could.

32:13.965 --> 32:15.626
What if you
had taken off?

32:17.669 --> 32:19.398
Well, that never
would have happened

32:19.437 --> 32:22.429
'cause l wasn't like that.
l did what l was told.

32:22.473 --> 32:24.941
Your father's son.

32:24.976 --> 32:26.773
Yeah, that's right.

32:26.811 --> 32:28.278
And all that went with it.

32:28.313 --> 32:31.248
That's right.
All the success and the money.

32:31.282 --> 32:34.183
But beyond that, what else
did you inherit?

32:35.486 --> 32:37.454
l'll tell you
what l inherited--

32:37.488 --> 32:39.547
my mother.

32:39.590 --> 32:43.321
Janice got laid.
She took off.

32:43.361 --> 32:45.693
She laughed
at all this shit.

32:45.730 --> 32:48.290
Then the trip's over
and she's back and she's one of us.

32:48.333 --> 32:49.857
And she wants
her piece.

32:49.901 --> 32:51.960
Well, let me tell you,
she gets nothing!

32:52.003 --> 32:55.439
'Cause l got the scars!
So it's mine!

33:21.933 --> 33:23.594
What are you doing?

33:23.634 --> 33:26.535
Cooking.
How was the call?

33:26.571 --> 33:29.665
lt was nothing.
lt was a laundromat on Webster.

33:34.579 --> 33:37.514
Thought l'd make a little dinner
like we do back home.

33:40.518 --> 33:44.249
We got pasta badan--

33:44.288 --> 33:46.483
macaroni
and potatoes--

33:46.524 --> 33:49.152
real peasant food.

33:49.193 --> 33:51.354
We got
a little salad.

33:52.930 --> 33:55.899
Then pork chops

33:55.933 --> 33:57.628
and vinegar peppers.

34:02.173 --> 34:05.233
l fuckin' miss
this shit, l gotta say.

34:05.276 --> 34:08.210
l can see why.

34:22.527 --> 34:24.552
You gotta wait
for that.

34:28.733 --> 34:32.065
- What?
- Nothing.

34:32.103 --> 34:34.936
l just realized--

34:34.972 --> 34:38.168
the other night when you cut
the power to the church...

34:39.677 --> 34:42.543
- l was a real dick.
- Yeah.

34:42.580 --> 34:45.208
But it was only because
l was worried, you know.

34:45.248 --> 34:48.275
Something could've
happened to you.

34:48.319 --> 34:50.184
That's a nice thing.

34:52.623 --> 34:54.681
You don't understand.

34:56.694 --> 34:59.629
Vincent...

34:59.664 --> 35:01.689
l love you.

35:05.002 --> 35:07.527
l love you,
''johnnycakes.''

35:19.684 --> 35:22.278
10:30, gotta be.

35:24.856 --> 35:29.088
Hour and a half,
lunch.

35:29.127 --> 35:32.528
The halfway
fuckin' point.

35:32.563 --> 35:36.124
Don't look at your watch.
Not yet.

35:36.167 --> 35:39.102
Save it.
Treat yourself.

35:44.041 --> 35:45.975
10 to 11 :00,

35:46.010 --> 35:49.138
maybe five of.

35:49.180 --> 35:50.477
Don't look.

35:50.515 --> 35:53.609
Think of those sandwiches
Jim made.

35:53.651 --> 35:56.176
When you've eaten
the last bite,

35:56.220 --> 35:59.383
this fuckin' day
is halfway gone.

36:04.061 --> 36:06.325
11 :30, has to be.

36:06.364 --> 36:09.629
Look at the angle
of the sun.

36:09.667 --> 36:11.601
Maybe even
a quarter to 1 2:00.

36:14.038 --> 36:15.938
Okay, look.

36:15.973 --> 36:17.531
Now.

36:19.944 --> 36:22.310
Fuck me!

36:34.258 --> 36:36.749
Vincent?

36:36.794 --> 36:39.285
Jiggle the toilet after.

36:43.501 --> 36:45.594
Vincent!

36:59.083 --> 37:01.745
Vincent!

37:20.104 --> 37:22.732
Moment of truth?

37:26.110 --> 37:28.840
lt's still
up to the judge,

37:28.879 --> 37:32.815
but they're gonna
recommend 15 years

37:32.850 --> 37:34.750
and $4.1 million.

37:36.020 --> 37:37.612
You keep the home,

37:37.655 --> 37:41.284
the 45k in equity from the girls'
variable life insurance,

37:41.325 --> 37:44.294
and Ginny's lRA
which is worth about 110 grand.

37:47.498 --> 37:49.830
- And?
- That's it.

37:50.835 --> 37:52.325
Or go to trial.

37:55.072 --> 37:57.506
15 fucking years.

37:57.541 --> 37:59.065
You're a young man.

37:59.110 --> 38:02.079
ln 15 years,
you'll be 67.

38:02.113 --> 38:03.410
The golden years.

38:03.447 --> 38:05.915
Grandkids.

38:12.757 --> 38:15.954
Do l have to to do
the allocution?

38:15.993 --> 38:19.429
You know the allocution
is always part of it,

38:19.463 --> 38:21.522
practically
the whole point.

38:29.507 --> 38:31.998
l'll take it.

38:36.914 --> 38:40.315
That lRA of Ginny's--

38:40.351 --> 38:43.616
she worked the tie counter
at Wanamaker's.

38:50.294 --> 38:52.353
That's where we met.

39:12.316 --> 39:15.183
No Mocha Mix?

39:15.219 --> 39:17.380
l was looking forward
to fresh blueberries this morning

39:17.421 --> 39:19.514
but Mom hasn't shopped.

39:24.462 --> 39:26.794
What are you doing
hanging around here?

39:26.831 --> 39:28.924
Finn asked me into the city
to see a movie,

39:28.966 --> 39:31.093
but l didn't want to go
and l told him he could go

39:31.135 --> 39:33.569
if he wanted to
and he went.

39:35.306 --> 39:38.707
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

39:38.743 --> 39:40.540
Don't give it
to me, okay?

39:43.914 --> 39:47.179
l know.
l'm sorry.

39:47.218 --> 39:50.676
lt's just...

39:50.721 --> 39:54.054
he doesn't
fucking get it.

39:54.091 --> 39:56.184
l don't even know
what he's thinking lately.

39:56.227 --> 39:58.957
He spends more time
at Jeffrey's apartment than with me.

40:06.937 --> 40:09.838
Come on.

40:11.942 --> 40:15.537
You know who's really good
to talk to about stuff?

40:15.579 --> 40:17.570
Your mother.

40:17.615 --> 40:22.018
This whole year off together,
l've seen such a selfish side.

40:22.052 --> 40:25.613
''l'll come back early.''
He said that. He actually said that.

40:32.430 --> 40:34.955
All right, well...

40:34.999 --> 40:38.560
maybe he thought
you wanted him to go.

40:38.602 --> 40:40.331
l mean, you did say it.

40:40.371 --> 40:43.340
Yeah, or maybe
subconsciously he's done.

40:43.374 --> 40:46.343
We sleep together
at Jeffrey's apartment,

40:46.377 --> 40:48.538
and Finn sleeps
on the floor half the time

40:48.579 --> 40:52.447
and l'm right there
for him.

40:52.483 --> 40:55.350
Okay, well, honey, when you're living
in sin with some guy,

40:55.386 --> 40:58.150
- you can't expect--
- Living in what?!

40:58.189 --> 41:00.020
Jesus Christ.

41:03.761 --> 41:06.229
You should talk to your mother
about this shit!

41:09.133 --> 41:11.897
Did you go see that guy
at the building department yet?

41:11.936 --> 41:15.428
l was going to go on Friday
when the schedules are looser.

41:16.640 --> 41:18.301
Well, don't.

41:35.326 --> 41:38.124
Fuck!

41:40.764 --> 41:42.493
Whoa whoa--
whoa whoa whoa!

41:52.610 --> 41:55.670
Jesus.
Are you all right?

41:55.713 --> 41:57.647
What the fuck are you doing
parked out here?

41:57.681 --> 42:00.411
Excuse me?
l'm getting my mail.

42:00.451 --> 42:02.919
You're driving
like a maniac.

42:02.953 --> 42:06.354
My God. How come your airbag
didn't go off?

42:06.390 --> 42:08.187
Somebody took it out.
They sold it.

42:08.225 --> 42:10.455
Sold it? Who would do
such a thing?

42:12.263 --> 42:15.994
Look, l'm really sorry.
l was in a rush.

42:16.033 --> 42:17.728
So you admit
it was your fault.

42:17.768 --> 42:19.531
Yeah, absolutely.

42:19.570 --> 42:23.006
Let me get the damages here
and l'll be on my way.

42:23.040 --> 42:25.600
Mmm, we should file
a police report.

42:25.643 --> 42:27.508
- You got a phone?
- No, seriously.

42:27.545 --> 42:31.208
What do you say,
500 bucks?

42:31.248 --> 42:33.739
Look, l took
the worst of it.

42:33.784 --> 42:36.776
And then you call your insurance on me?
No, thank you.

42:36.820 --> 42:38.947
l'm not gonna
do that. Six?

42:38.989 --> 42:41.423
Look, l don't want
an argument here.

42:41.458 --> 42:43.358
My place is just
up the drive there.

42:43.394 --> 42:45.658
We'll call the police.
They'll come right out.

42:49.199 --> 42:51.963
Turn on
your hazards.

42:53.203 --> 42:55.569
Let me get
my registration.

43:27.705 --> 43:29.605
Motherfucker!

43:31.208 --> 43:34.405
Fucking
cocksucking cunt!

43:34.445 --> 43:36.470
Fuck!

43:42.152 --> 43:44.746
Tony! Hey!

43:44.788 --> 43:46.551
l was just coming
to see you.

43:46.590 --> 43:48.148
l'm on my way home.

43:48.192 --> 43:50.023
lt's just l haven't
heard from you.

43:50.060 --> 43:52.028
Uh, the fuckhead
from fuckland?

43:52.062 --> 43:55.190
- Yeah.
- lt's gonna be too much effort.

43:55.232 --> 43:57.700
Well, John was really
counting on this.

43:59.236 --> 44:00.726
And Ginny
needs the money,

44:00.771 --> 44:03.535
for Allegra,
for the family.

44:08.479 --> 44:10.538
What?

44:17.855 --> 44:19.152
He changed
the terms.

44:19.189 --> 44:21.555
What, a bigger piece
for his fat mouth?

44:21.592 --> 44:23.890
No, smaller,
actually.

44:23.927 --> 44:26.122
But it's the house.

44:27.798 --> 44:30.028
He wants you to unload it
to his sister

44:30.067 --> 44:32.558
at a reduced price.

44:32.603 --> 44:34.264
Half, actually.

44:35.873 --> 44:37.932
But the New Orleans
thing--

44:37.975 --> 44:40.205
he'll knock 2/% off
his finder's fee

44:40.244 --> 44:42.678
and he'll make sure
those pricks sell.

44:46.383 --> 44:48.783
l guess beggars
can't be choosers.

44:50.354 --> 44:51.844
And the worst part is

44:51.889 --> 44:55.450
l gotta sell the idea
to Ginny somehow.

44:56.593 --> 45:00.324
Gab took me
to her Moroccan tile place.

45:00.364 --> 45:02.332
By the way--
l don't wanna pester you--

45:02.366 --> 45:04.596
Did Sil make
a visit?

45:04.635 --> 45:06.967
Yeah, l meant
to tell you.

45:07.004 --> 45:09.097
He didn't have any luck
with that inspector.

45:09.139 --> 45:11.266
Really? You're kidding.

45:11.308 --> 45:15.335
No. Sorry about that.

45:15.379 --> 45:17.210
Did he bring him
a gift?

45:17.247 --> 45:18.874
Cash.

45:18.916 --> 45:21.214
So how hard
did he lean on the guy?

45:22.553 --> 45:25.386
Carm, Sil knows
his business.

45:25.422 --> 45:27.947
Look, l know
you're disappointed, but--

45:27.991 --> 45:29.618
l just gotta
put this out there--

45:29.660 --> 45:32.151
just sell it.
You'll get a good price.

45:32.196 --> 45:34.323
30/% return
on your investment.

45:35.766 --> 45:38.496
So that's it?
You-- you just give up?

45:38.535 --> 45:40.298
l don't think l ever
heard that before.

45:40.337 --> 45:43.636
Look, the guy said no.

45:43.674 --> 45:45.665
How far do you wanna
push this thing?

45:50.748 --> 45:52.716
Oh, those sons
of bitches.

45:52.750 --> 45:55.412
All my planning
for a fucking year!

45:56.954 --> 45:59.787
And they let people
build those fucking monstrosities!

46:07.498 --> 46:10.956
You wanna go out to dinner
tonight at least?

46:11.001 --> 46:14.630
Why not put
a runner here

46:14.671 --> 46:18.232
or a large diameter
round Oriental?

46:18.275 --> 46:21.108
lt could cut down
on the echo and warm it up.

46:21.145 --> 46:24.171
Well, l'd rather we spend on
what we have to right now.

46:24.214 --> 46:26.079
Window treatments.

46:26.116 --> 46:29.449
Mr. Sacrimoni,
during the time period

46:29.486 --> 46:34.514
beginning approximately
January 1, 1996, through today,

46:34.558 --> 46:37.959
were you employed by
or associated with

46:37.995 --> 46:41.795
the New York faction of an organized
crime family of La Cosa Nostra?

46:44.968 --> 46:47.095
Yes.

46:47.137 --> 46:49.799
Sacrimoni allocuted
in federal court,

46:49.840 --> 46:53.241
admitting at least a 10-year connection
with La Cosa Nostra.

46:53.277 --> 46:55.768
Fucking nauseating!

46:55.813 --> 46:58.281
Could have been worse.
He could have flipped.

46:58.315 --> 46:59.907
Are you fucking
kidding me?

46:59.950 --> 47:03.511
You don't ever admit the existence
of this thing. Ever.

47:03.554 --> 47:05.283
He should have stood
trial like a man.

47:05.322 --> 47:07.984
l did
20 fucking years.

47:17.568 --> 47:19.092
What?

47:21.905 --> 47:23.497
Johnny Sack
pleaded guilty.

47:23.540 --> 47:26.634
lt was just
on the radio.

47:26.677 --> 47:28.941
He got 15 years.

47:35.419 --> 47:36.943
Fuck!

47:38.722 --> 47:42.488
Hey! Hold on.

47:42.526 --> 47:43.993
Wait a fucking minute.

47:44.027 --> 47:46.052
- Are you the owner of this vehicle?
- Yeah.

47:46.096 --> 47:49.088
l got a spot in the garage.
l went in for a half an hour, tops.

47:49.132 --> 47:50.724
Douchebags make
that a red zone?

47:50.767 --> 47:54.430
This is a seizure order for all assets
belonging to John Sacrimoni.

47:54.471 --> 47:56.905
No no. l bought it
from his wife.

47:56.940 --> 48:01.343
Well, if she sold it, she violated
a court order freezing his assets.

48:01.378 --> 48:05.109
Of course she sold it.
l paid her fucking 25 grand cash.

48:05.148 --> 48:06.911
lt's going to be auctioned in May
up in Parsippany.

48:06.950 --> 48:08.713
You like it so much,
buy it again.

48:08.752 --> 48:11.550
This is fucking insane,
you cocksucking motherfucker!

48:11.588 --> 48:15.319
Keep talking like that.
l'm gonna get a truck out here for you.

48:18.962 --> 48:22.261
To think that piece of shit
was my friend once.

48:22.299 --> 48:23.926
l hope he dies
in there.

48:23.967 --> 48:25.798
You know
how this looks?

48:25.836 --> 48:29.135
l wish l was on the courthouse steps
to throw acid in his face,

48:29.172 --> 48:31.265
just to distance
myself.

48:32.276 --> 48:33.800
Excuse me, Tony.

48:39.283 --> 48:41.376
l've been
meaning to ask you--

48:41.418 --> 48:44.046
l was just wondering
about the Sacrimoni place.

48:44.087 --> 48:45.714
What about it?

48:45.756 --> 48:48.520
Well, now that
Mr. Sacrimoni is guilty,

48:48.558 --> 48:51.925
do you think l could maybe
take him off my route?

48:53.497 --> 48:55.294
What the fuck
did you just say, Sal?

48:55.332 --> 48:56.924
l don't know.

48:56.967 --> 49:00.562
The fucking lawnmower man
just said John was guilty, T.

49:02.372 --> 49:05.432
He pled guilty, Sal.
Okay?

49:05.475 --> 49:06.840
Yeah, okay.

49:06.877 --> 49:08.845
With this government,
no fucking trial.

49:08.879 --> 49:11.609
Maybe they stuck tasers
on his balls

49:11.648 --> 49:13.843
and beat him mercilessly
with a rubber hose.

49:13.884 --> 49:15.681
- You ever think of that?
- No.

49:15.719 --> 49:18.620
But of course,
it makes sense.

49:18.655 --> 49:21.920
Don't besmirch
the man, Sal.

49:21.959 --> 49:24.359
So about the yard--

49:24.394 --> 49:26.794
Do you believe
this fucking guy?

49:31.201 --> 49:32.668
You're done with that.

49:32.703 --> 49:35.968
Come on. Let's go
check out these DVDs.

50:11.541 --> 50:13.941
Mead, put
the cavatell' in.

50:13.977 --> 50:16.571
- Hey there.
- Hi.

50:16.613 --> 50:19.275
- Where's Christopher?
- He went out to an AA meeting.

50:25.989 --> 50:28.116
- Tony?
- Yeah.

50:33.663 --> 50:36.860
l just wanted to say

50:36.900 --> 50:38.390
thank you.

50:40.537 --> 50:43.199
You're welcome.

50:47.177 --> 50:51.307
No one's ever done
something so-- so--

50:53.817 --> 50:57.014
lt's okay, Janice.
Really.

51:04.895 --> 51:06.954
- Hey Tony?
- Uh-huh.

51:06.997 --> 51:09.761
You got the wine?
We're almost ready.

51:10.767 --> 51:12.701
Hey, what happened?

51:16.973 --> 51:18.907
Jan.

51:18.942 --> 51:22.469
No one knows
what goes on in my head.

51:22.512 --> 51:26.039
What's the matter?
What happened?

51:26.083 --> 51:29.985
She's happy...
about the house.

51:32.889 --> 51:35.722
Oh, honey,
it's okay.

51:35.759 --> 51:37.283
lt's okay.

51:40.230 --> 51:42.926
- Come on. You okay?
- Oh-- yeah.

51:44.734 --> 51:47.294
- You all right?
- Yeah.
