WEBVTT

00:01.869 --> 00:03.302
<i> And now, Dickie Dobbins,</i>

00:03.304 --> 00:04.970
<i> with the channel 3</i>
<i> Doppler 12,000</i>

00:04.972 --> 00:07.506
<i> Accu-Climate</i>
<i> Weather-Plus Forecast.</i>

00:07.508 --> 00:09.775
We got more record heat
movin' in.

00:09.777 --> 00:11.877
My guess is it's from Eurasia,

00:11.879 --> 00:13.512
or even, possibly,

00:13.514 --> 00:16.382
the<i> Dark</i> Continent.

00:16.384 --> 00:18.650
That's where Miss Maisie
comes from.

00:18.652 --> 00:20.386
She raised me.

00:20.388 --> 00:21.687
Jesus, Dickie.
(nervous chuckle)

00:21.689 --> 00:23.822
it's -- it's important
to remember

00:23.824 --> 00:25.557
old Dickie comes
from a different era.

00:25.559 --> 00:26.725
Right, Terry?

00:26.727 --> 00:28.627
Oh, that's right.

00:28.629 --> 00:32.464
Sometimes I forget
(tearfully) that he's gone.

00:32.466 --> 00:35.634
As the week-long
beat wave continues --

00:35.636 --> 00:37.136
beat wave?
What's a beat wave?

00:37.138 --> 00:39.705
As the heat wave --
sorry -- continues --

00:39.707 --> 00:42.541
(sobs)

00:42.543 --> 00:44.209
I just hate
seeing Greg like this.

00:44.211 --> 00:46.178
Guy's been a mess
ever since Terry

00:46.180 --> 00:48.580
dumped him and left town
to follow 311 on tour.

00:48.582 --> 00:49.815
You know what?

00:49.817 --> 00:51.350
Greg needs a new man,

00:51.352 --> 00:53.252
and I'm gonna
help him find one.

00:53.254 --> 00:54.553
Why?

00:54.555 --> 00:56.655
Because that's
what you do for friends.

00:56.657 --> 00:58.924
At least, that's what
<i> I</i> do for friends.

00:58.926 --> 01:02.027
In high school, my nickname
was Superfriend.

01:02.029 --> 01:05.364
Actually,
it was Supermouth.

01:05.366 --> 01:06.865
Actually, it was
Suckmachine.

01:06.867 --> 01:09.334
They called me
Stan The Man.

01:09.336 --> 01:12.237
There was a girl
in my class named Stan.

01:12.239 --> 01:15.174
(band plays)

01:15.176 --> 01:18.110
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

01:18.112 --> 01:21.547
¶ I got a feelin' that
it's gonna be a wonderful day ¶

01:21.549 --> 01:24.450
¶ The sun in the sky
has a smile on his face ¶

01:24.452 --> 01:28.187
¶ And he's shinin' a salute
to the American race ¶

01:30.925 --> 01:34.193
¶ Oh, boy, it's swell to say ¶

01:34.195 --> 01:36.428
¶ Good -- ¶
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

01:36.430 --> 01:37.596
Aah!

01:39.366 --> 01:42.267
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

01:42.269 --> 01:45.037
(tranquil tune plays)

01:45.039 --> 01:47.306
Just a little
more pepper.

01:47.308 --> 01:48.907
Greg's coming
up the driveway!

01:48.909 --> 01:51.076
Aah! Aaaaaaah!

01:51.078 --> 01:52.811
Now, remember --

01:52.813 --> 01:54.446
We're pumping him
for information

01:54.448 --> 01:56.148
about his perfect guy

01:56.150 --> 01:58.283
so we can find someone
to set him up with.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.419
It's actually
the perfect temperature.

02:00.421 --> 02:02.554
Can someone toss me a tecate?
-I'll tell you

02:02.556 --> 02:04.823
what my perfect man
would be if I was gay.

02:04.825 --> 02:07.493
He'd have smooth,
soft skin,

02:07.495 --> 02:08.827
long, shiny hair,

02:08.829 --> 02:10.629
a narrow waist
and wide hips,

02:10.631 --> 02:12.598
forming the shape
of an hourglass.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.800
Pouty lips,
big doe eyes.

02:14.802 --> 02:17.302
A musical,
high-pitched voice.

02:17.304 --> 02:20.606
Large, supple, breast-like
pectoral muscles.

02:20.608 --> 02:21.974
And huge balls.

02:21.976 --> 02:23.609
Something you can really
grab onto.

02:23.611 --> 02:24.676
Stan!

02:24.678 --> 02:26.745
Oh, we're
at dinner now.

02:26.747 --> 02:28.280
Thank you so much
for having me.

02:28.282 --> 02:29.748
It's nice to get out
of the house.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.116
Our pleasure.

02:31.118 --> 02:33.785
Now, what would you
like for dessert,

02:33.787 --> 02:37.356
a<i> bear</i> claw
or a<i> twink-ie?</i>

02:37.358 --> 02:40.092
Or maybe
<i> Asian</i> dessert?

02:40.094 --> 02:41.760
We haven't even
eaten dinner yet.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.262
Okay, then,
let's start with salad.

02:43.264 --> 02:44.763
Would you like your
dressing on the<i> top</i>

02:44.765 --> 02:46.932
of your salad,
or on the bottom?

02:46.934 --> 02:48.600
How would you put it
on the bottom?

02:50.337 --> 02:52.638
Okay, what are you two
up to?

02:52.640 --> 02:54.306
All right.
The truth is

02:54.308 --> 02:56.508
we were trying
to figure out your type

02:56.510 --> 02:57.843
so we could set you up.

02:57.845 --> 03:00.279
You just seem so down
ever since Terry left.

03:00.281 --> 03:02.948
Oh.
That's sweet of you.

03:02.950 --> 03:05.384
I admit, I do miss Terry
as a life partner,

03:05.386 --> 03:07.519
but to be honest,
I miss him more right now

03:07.521 --> 03:09.555
as a work partner.

03:09.557 --> 03:10.956
I'm -- I'm sorry.
That -- that probably

03:10.958 --> 03:12.524
didn't exactly warrant
a spit-take.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.293
Kind of jumped the gun
there. Go on.

03:14.295 --> 03:16.962
What makes a reporter,
journalistic integrity?

03:16.964 --> 03:18.664
Ha!
It's the banter!

03:18.666 --> 03:21.033
But you can't just plug anybody
into that other chair.

03:21.035 --> 03:23.702
You need chemistry
and chemistry is hard.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.137
Tell me about it.

03:25.139 --> 03:27.239
I burned down my school
in chemistry class.

03:27.241 --> 03:30.075
My school experience
was pretty<i> flaming,</i> too,

03:30.077 --> 03:32.010
if you know what I mean.
(chuckle)

03:32.012 --> 03:33.712
I bet you were quite
the fire-starter.

03:33.714 --> 03:34.980
Just call me
young Drew Barrymore.

03:34.982 --> 03:36.848
You're not the only one
who liked

03:36.850 --> 03:38.650
"Riding in Cars
with Boys."

03:38.652 --> 03:39.718
"Charlie's Angels"!

03:39.720 --> 03:41.019
"Charlie's Angels 2"!

03:41.021 --> 03:42.187
"Home Fries"!

03:42.189 --> 03:43.355
(gasp) Francine,

03:43.357 --> 03:44.923
do you realize
what we're doing?

03:44.925 --> 03:46.925
We're bantering.
Crazy idea --

03:46.927 --> 03:49.061
Would you come fill in
in Terry's old seat?

03:49.063 --> 03:51.063
Just until we find
a permanent replacement.

03:51.065 --> 03:52.397
I don't know, Greg.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.233
I'm not really up
on current events.

03:54.235 --> 03:56.868
I get most of my news
off Snapple caps.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.403
Please, Francine.

03:58.405 --> 03:59.705
To help a friend.

03:59.707 --> 04:03.609
Sounds like a job
for Suckmachine.

04:03.611 --> 04:05.410
How'd you know
my high school nickname?

04:10.851 --> 04:12.951
Hey, check out what
we found in the basement.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.286
You walk in
without knocking

04:14.288 --> 04:15.587
like a bunch of Duprees?

04:15.589 --> 04:17.222
It's my old
Dream Phone game.

04:17.224 --> 04:19.558
It's so dumb.
You try to figure out

04:19.560 --> 04:21.126
which cute boy
has a crush on you.

04:21.128 --> 04:23.228
We thought it'd be fun
to play as a goof.

04:23.230 --> 04:25.197
Doesn't sound fun.
Sounds lame.

04:25.199 --> 04:26.431
But I guess I'll do it,

04:26.433 --> 04:28.033
'cause I got
nothing else to do.

04:28.035 --> 04:30.035
But it sounds boring.
I'm gonna be bored.

04:30.037 --> 04:32.070
I was right.
This is boring.

04:32.072 --> 04:33.905
I'm bored. I think
I'm just about ready to --

04:33.907 --> 04:36.375
Who is that?!

04:36.377 --> 04:37.776
(breathily) Dylan.
(piano flourish)

04:37.778 --> 04:39.578
(ring)
Hello?

04:39.580 --> 04:41.480
<i> Your crush loves pizza.</i>

04:41.482 --> 04:43.148
That could be Dylan.

04:43.150 --> 04:44.483
We like
all the same things.

04:44.485 --> 04:46.752
Dylan likes the mall.
I like the mall.

04:46.754 --> 04:51.056
Oh, my God.
Is he...the one?

04:51.058 --> 04:53.325
¶ I once wished a wish ¶

04:53.327 --> 04:55.394
¶ One day I would meet ya ¶

04:55.396 --> 04:57.296
¶ My two scoops of kisses ¶

04:57.298 --> 04:59.831
¶ With a heart
shaped like pizza ¶

04:59.833 --> 05:02.934
¶ What angel or genie ¶

05:02.936 --> 05:04.603
¶ Led me here to you? ¶

05:04.605 --> 05:07.906
¶ My telephone Romeo ¶

05:07.908 --> 05:12.177
¶ My dream come true ¶

05:12.179 --> 05:15.614
¶ My dream come true ¶

05:15.616 --> 05:18.483
(moaning)

05:18.485 --> 05:23.655
¶ My dream come true ¶

05:23.657 --> 05:25.357
I'd sing you
the second verse,

05:25.359 --> 05:28.694
but it gets pretty...
explicit.

05:30.331 --> 05:34.333
And remember, we are
the news of Langley Falls.

05:34.335 --> 05:37.469
Without us, people making dinner
won't know who's been murdered!

05:37.471 --> 05:39.604
¶¶

05:39.606 --> 05:41.173
Good evening.
I'm Greg Corbin.

05:41.175 --> 05:43.141
And I'm Francine Smith.

05:43.143 --> 05:44.776
Our top story tonight --

05:44.778 --> 05:47.379
17 alligators
were set loose today

05:47.381 --> 05:50.816
when an oak tree fell on a fence
at the Langley Falls Gator Farm.

05:50.818 --> 05:52.284
Dickie,
I bet you were around

05:52.286 --> 05:53.518
when that oak tree
was planted.

05:53.520 --> 05:54.553
Huh?

05:54.555 --> 05:55.987
Planted?

05:55.989 --> 05:58.056
Dickie was around when
the oak tree was invented.

05:58.058 --> 05:59.725
(chuckle)
Looks like those gators

05:59.727 --> 06:01.059
aren't the only ones
who bite.

06:01.061 --> 06:02.861
Chomp, chomp.
(chuckle)

06:02.863 --> 06:05.197
Her banter -- It's beautiful.

06:05.199 --> 06:09.735
¶ She's a revelatio-o-o-
o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-n! ¶

06:09.737 --> 06:11.136
Oh, she's good.

06:11.138 --> 06:12.971
Real good.

06:12.973 --> 06:15.374
<i> Too</i> good.

06:15.376 --> 06:18.243
This will end poorly.

06:18.245 --> 06:20.078
<i> Raven!</i>

06:20.080 --> 06:21.880
(laughs)

06:21.882 --> 06:23.682
She's so Raven.

06:23.684 --> 06:25.384
Real Raven.

06:25.386 --> 06:27.753
<i> Too</i> Raven.

06:27.755 --> 06:30.489
This will end poorly.

06:33.527 --> 06:36.695
¶¶

06:36.697 --> 06:38.029
Thank you.

06:38.031 --> 06:39.664
This is the first
and last step

06:39.666 --> 06:41.333
to opening
my dry-cleaning business.

06:41.335 --> 06:44.403
So, we eat here
for free?

06:44.405 --> 06:46.371
I never realized
being the husband

06:46.373 --> 06:48.840
of a local news celeb
would be so sweet!

06:48.842 --> 06:50.909
Ah, the perks are nice,
but remember --

06:50.911 --> 06:52.944
I'm doing all this
to help Greg.

06:52.946 --> 06:56.915
Complimentary order
of shrimp enchiladas. Mwah!

06:56.917 --> 06:59.518
The veins in the shrimp
are -- how you say?

06:59.520 --> 07:02.187
Bursting with turds tonight.

07:02.189 --> 07:04.656
That's exactly
how you say it, Miguel.

07:08.228 --> 07:10.228
One more call,
and I'll zero in

07:10.230 --> 07:12.597
on the identity
of the landline strangler.

07:12.599 --> 07:13.932
I've crafted my own narrative

07:13.934 --> 07:15.600
to enhance my enjoyment
of the game.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.469
Now, talk to me, you sicko!

07:17.471 --> 07:19.237
Who are you talking to?
Is it Dylan?

07:19.239 --> 07:21.106
(grunting)

07:21.108 --> 07:22.274
keep your paws off him,
you slut!

07:22.276 --> 07:23.642
(ring)

07:23.644 --> 07:25.310
<i> your crush hates the mall.</i>

07:25.312 --> 07:26.912
Hates the mall?
It's not Dylan.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.447
We're resetting.
(beep)

07:28.449 --> 07:30.482
Roger, you can't just
keep resetting the game

07:30.484 --> 07:32.317
every time
until you get Dylan.

07:32.319 --> 07:34.753
I don't see why you're
so hung up on Dylan, anyway.

07:34.755 --> 07:37.556
Tyler is clearly the cutest
of the dream boys.

07:37.558 --> 07:39.558
Hell, I'd even take
Wayne over Dylan.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.326
You have six seconds

07:41.328 --> 07:42.627
to suck
those filthy words back

07:42.629 --> 07:43.929
inside your rotten
little mouth.

07:43.931 --> 07:45.263
Damn it, Roger.

07:45.265 --> 07:46.998
This isn't even
a real person, okay?

07:47.000 --> 07:50.268
This is just some model who
posed for a picture in 1994.

07:50.270 --> 07:51.837
It's insane
to have a crush

07:51.839 --> 07:53.905
on a fake person
on a fake phone.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.907
(sigh)
You're right.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.242
The sane thing to do is

07:57.244 --> 07:59.277
track down the model
who posed for the card

07:59.279 --> 08:00.612
and go on a road trip
to meet him.

08:00.614 --> 08:02.180
Exactly.

08:02.182 --> 08:05.250
¶ I'm so excited ¶

08:05.252 --> 08:07.519
¶ And I just can't hide it ¶

08:07.521 --> 08:09.254
¶ No, no, no ¶

08:09.256 --> 08:10.622
¶ I'm about to lose control ¶

08:10.624 --> 08:12.657
¶ And I think I like it ¶

08:12.659 --> 08:13.959
<i> ¶ Ooh, hey ¶</i>

08:13.961 --> 08:15.927
I know I like you, Dylan.

08:20.467 --> 08:21.933
(laughter)

08:21.935 --> 08:23.301
Of course, that was back
when it was okay

08:23.303 --> 08:25.337
to bring a crossbow
on a bus.

08:25.339 --> 08:29.140
This just in -- channel 3's
own Dickie Dobbins has...

08:29.142 --> 08:30.709
died?

08:30.711 --> 08:32.110
Of a stroke.

08:32.112 --> 08:34.346
I didn't know
you could die from that.

08:34.348 --> 08:36.281
I thought it just
made you talk funny.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.517
Ah, I had
a stroke, see?

08:38.519 --> 08:40.952
We always poke fun
at Dickie, sure,

08:40.954 --> 08:42.454
but I never thought
we'd...

08:42.456 --> 08:46.224
(wheels squeaking)

08:46.226 --> 08:47.526
...lose him.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.061
Greg?

08:54.001 --> 08:55.667
(sighs)

08:55.669 --> 08:57.402
Ladies and gentlemen,

08:57.404 --> 09:00.872
heaven just got one hell
of a weather angel.

09:00.874 --> 09:03.575
Or, if the allegations
that followed Dickie

09:03.577 --> 09:06.478
his entire life
turn out to have been true,

09:06.480 --> 09:10.415
hell just got one angel
of a weather demon.

09:10.417 --> 09:13.752
And...we're...out.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.554
Thank you, Francine.
That --

09:15.556 --> 09:16.888
That was wonderful.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.356
You just
got in the zone.

09:18.358 --> 09:19.891
It was like there was
no one else at the desk.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.259
Oh! (laughs)

09:21.261 --> 09:22.894
Oh, that's ridiculous.

09:22.896 --> 09:26.264
Who ever heard of one person
anchoring the news?

09:26.266 --> 09:27.566
(laughs)
-(nervous laugh)

09:27.568 --> 09:29.401
(laughs)

09:29.403 --> 09:31.169
But do ya think?

09:31.171 --> 09:34.673
¶¶

09:34.675 --> 09:37.042
So, I had the sassiest
waiter the other day.

09:37.044 --> 09:40.078
Oh, I'll tell you
how I feel about sassy waiters.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.180
"Homey don't play
around wit' dat."

09:42.182 --> 09:44.883
Remember that,
the black clown? Anyway.

09:44.885 --> 09:48.687
¶¶

09:50.190 --> 09:52.791
If I was that
hang-glide instructor,

09:52.793 --> 09:55.193
I'd have just cut
that big boy loose.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.728
Well, I --
-Oh, we're gonna get calls

09:56.730 --> 09:58.196
on that one, aren't we?
-I-I once --

09:58.198 --> 10:00.632
Oh, behave, Francine.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.067
(laughs)

10:02.069 --> 10:05.370
¶¶

10:08.308 --> 10:09.741
(music climbs)

10:12.946 --> 10:15.013
¶¶

10:18.452 --> 10:20.785
Man, Francine really
ain't letting you

10:20.787 --> 10:22.621
get a word in
edgewise, is she?

10:22.623 --> 10:24.956
Oh, she's just doing
her part to be helpful.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.558
And you know
what they say,

10:26.560 --> 10:27.892
"There's no 'I' in 'team.'"

10:27.894 --> 10:29.661
No!
I don't know that,

10:29.663 --> 10:30.962
'cause I never learned
to read!

10:30.964 --> 10:32.931
(sobbing)

10:32.933 --> 10:34.466
(hissing)

10:34.468 --> 10:35.767
Aah!

10:35.769 --> 10:37.235
Why do we have
this room?!

10:39.806 --> 10:41.339
So, they've got
a killer new

10:41.341 --> 10:43.808
verde shrimp chimichanga
down at Larry's.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.310
I was thinking maybe
you could work in

10:45.312 --> 10:46.611
a plug
on the show today.

10:46.613 --> 10:47.946
I'm not gonna
compromise the news

10:47.948 --> 10:49.814
to make you a hero
at Loco Larry's.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.683
This isn't about you.

10:51.685 --> 10:53.018
And it's not about me.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.519
It's about Greg.

10:54.521 --> 10:56.921
Now, I really need to do
my vocal warm-ups.

10:56.923 --> 10:59.324
¶ Me me me me me ¶

10:59.326 --> 11:00.992
¶ Not Greg,
not Greg, not Greg ¶

11:00.994 --> 11:04.963
¶ All that is his
will be mine ¶

11:04.965 --> 11:06.665
What's going on?

11:06.667 --> 11:08.099
We've finally got
a new weather guy

11:08.101 --> 11:10.635
to replace Dickie --
Memphis Stormfront.

11:10.637 --> 11:12.470
From channel 6
in Raleigh-Durham.

11:12.472 --> 11:14.472
They say he gives
great banter.

11:14.474 --> 11:16.374
(Southern accent)
And that he's got his eye
on the anchor desk.

11:16.376 --> 11:18.209
He might be just the guy
to be Greg's

11:18.211 --> 11:19.544
permanent co-anchor,
fool!

11:19.546 --> 11:20.979
Why are you doing that?

11:20.981 --> 11:25.450
I love Gossi-i-i-p!

11:25.452 --> 11:28.319
(laughter)

11:28.321 --> 11:31.990
¶¶

11:31.992 --> 11:34.526
We have a new member
of the channel 3 team,

11:34.528 --> 11:35.894
and we're
about to find out

11:35.896 --> 11:38.496
"weather" he's
any good at his job.

11:38.498 --> 11:40.398
A job, by the way...

11:40.400 --> 11:43.001
that can be done better
by a free phone app.

11:43.003 --> 11:44.369
Memphis?

11:44.371 --> 11:47.539
"Appy" to prove you wrong,
there, Francine.

11:47.541 --> 11:51.743
I'd also happily help you
find a phone made after 1998.

11:51.745 --> 11:53.311
Hey, no fair!
That's just a backup

11:53.313 --> 11:54.879
until her beeper gets
out of the shop.

11:54.881 --> 11:56.681
Ooh! Burn!

11:56.683 --> 11:58.883
Um, uh...

11:58.885 --> 11:59.984
I...

11:59.986 --> 12:01.753
ch-chimichanga.

12:01.755 --> 12:03.555
Turning to the five-day
forecast.

12:03.557 --> 12:05.724
I haven't felt this kind of
on-air chemistry since Terry.

12:05.726 --> 12:07.759
I think he's the one.
Isn't this great?

12:07.761 --> 12:09.194
You'll be able
to go back

12:09.196 --> 12:10.595
to your whatever you do
with your days.

12:13.767 --> 12:14.999
My lokey!

12:15.001 --> 12:18.002
I want that
weather punk gone!

12:18.004 --> 12:21.339
I just heard
you got Memphis fired.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.608
He was deadweight,
ratings poison,

12:23.610 --> 12:25.410
a real Ray Donovan.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.011
I was looking out
for ya.

12:27.013 --> 12:29.447
Look, you've been such
a good friend to me,

12:29.449 --> 12:31.716
so speaking
as your good friend,

12:31.718 --> 12:33.518
I think your love
of the limelight

12:33.520 --> 12:35.019
is clouding
your judgment.

12:35.021 --> 12:36.921
Oh. Wow!

12:36.923 --> 12:39.257
Thank you
for helping me realize

12:39.259 --> 12:41.559
(crunch)
what an ingrate you are.

12:41.561 --> 12:43.061
Francine,
you're hurting me!

12:43.063 --> 12:44.562
<i> I</i> get the viewers.

12:44.564 --> 12:46.564
<i>I</i> make the news fun.
(crunch)

12:46.566 --> 12:48.933
And I do it all
to help<i> you!</i>

12:48.935 --> 12:50.135
Well, you're gonna have
a hard time

12:50.137 --> 12:52.637
helping me,
because me quits!

12:52.639 --> 12:53.738
(sobbing)

12:53.740 --> 12:55.073
wait, wait!

12:55.075 --> 12:56.541
Greg, come back!

12:56.543 --> 12:58.910
I didn't mean
what I said.

12:58.912 --> 13:01.279
I've never seen
"Ray Donovan."

13:01.281 --> 13:03.081
It could be
a good show.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.650
I don't know.
We don't get Showtime.

13:05.652 --> 13:07.218
Everything else
I said stands.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.953
(sobbing)

13:14.327 --> 13:17.095
Stupid, ungrateful Greg.

13:17.097 --> 13:19.898
I guess some friends just
don't want to be helped.

13:39.953 --> 13:41.820
Oh, my God!

13:41.822 --> 13:45.089
I was so busy telling myself
I was helping Greg,

13:45.091 --> 13:47.458
I couldn't see how much
I was hurting him.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.794
Oh, we need
to make this right.

13:49.796 --> 13:52.664
Are you okay, losing
your Loco Larry's perks?

13:52.666 --> 13:54.632
Hey, helping Greg
is more important

13:54.634 --> 13:56.434
than eating
16 burritos a day,

13:56.436 --> 13:57.635
every day of the week.

13:57.637 --> 13:58.837
Also, my --

13:58.839 --> 14:00.038
my colon came out.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.139
What?

14:01.141 --> 14:02.507
M-my colon came out.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.509
I-I looked it up online
and it is reversible.

14:04.511 --> 14:08.179
Greg and Memphis are so clearly
right for each other.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.815
We need to get 'em
back together

14:10.817 --> 14:12.450
<i> and</i> back on the air.

14:12.452 --> 14:15.453
Easier said than done.
Mmm. Mmm.

14:15.455 --> 14:17.522
Greg's done with TV.
Runs a cake shop now.

14:17.524 --> 14:20.491
Another interesting tidbit --
Greg might not be

14:20.493 --> 14:23.595
the macho lady-killer
we all think he is.

14:27.901 --> 14:29.567
Greg, please.

14:29.569 --> 14:32.570
You're the one who belongs
behind that desk, not me.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.572
I'm sorry.
I'm not going back.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.541
Even if you did get
Memphis back, too.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.176
And good luck with<i> that.</i>

14:38.178 --> 14:39.577
He's a stormchaser now.

14:39.579 --> 14:41.145
Said at least
you can trust a tornado

14:41.147 --> 14:42.981
not to stab you in the back.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.983
Also, you know Ashley in HR?

14:44.985 --> 14:47.151
Got an abortion.

14:47.153 --> 14:49.721
What do we need
a weatherman for anyway?

14:49.723 --> 14:51.322
You said it yourself.

14:51.324 --> 14:52.557
Unless, of course,
there was some sort of

14:52.559 --> 14:54.926
cataclysmic superstorm
to cover.

14:54.928 --> 14:58.062
But barring that, I would
get rid of the snake room

14:58.064 --> 14:59.764
before I brought back
Greg and Memphis.

14:59.766 --> 15:01.866
Ohh!

15:01.868 --> 15:04.068
(munching)

15:04.070 --> 15:05.937
I just know deep down,

15:05.939 --> 15:08.039
Greg wants to come back
to the news.

15:08.041 --> 15:10.575
If I could only get
him and Memphis back

15:10.577 --> 15:13.177
on the air together
for one broadcast.

15:13.179 --> 15:14.579
But we'd need to be able

15:14.581 --> 15:16.547
to control the weather
to do that.

15:16.549 --> 15:19.517
Easy as pie.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.552
Stan, that's a cake.
-Oh, what would you say?

15:21.554 --> 15:22.754
"Piece of cake."

15:22.756 --> 15:24.022
Oh, yeah,
it's really easy

15:24.024 --> 15:25.356
to come up
with clever word play

15:25.358 --> 15:26.691
when you're not
holding in your butthole

15:26.693 --> 15:28.192
with a piece
of duct tape.

15:28.194 --> 15:29.794
(ring)

15:29.796 --> 15:32.530
Top-secret CIA weather-control
division. Dick speaking.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.098
I mean, pizza store!

15:34.100 --> 15:35.633
Oh, it's you, Stan.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.101
What kind of favor?

15:43.610 --> 15:44.809
(warble)

15:52.786 --> 15:54.619
(playing heavy metal)

15:54.621 --> 15:57.188
(thunder rumbles)

15:59.626 --> 16:02.126
(doorbell rings)

16:02.128 --> 16:03.328
(gasps)

16:03.330 --> 16:04.629
can I help you?

16:04.631 --> 16:06.731
You've aged beautifully.

16:06.733 --> 16:07.932
What?
-A drink? Sure!

16:07.934 --> 16:09.334
I'll take a sweet tea,
no ice.

16:09.336 --> 16:11.002
You'll have one, too.
Put this in yours.

16:11.004 --> 16:13.504
Come on in. Let's get you
out of those wet clothes.

16:13.506 --> 16:16.074
(wind blows)

16:19.145 --> 16:21.079
Hello?
I received an order

16:21.081 --> 16:22.780
to deliver a cake
to this lamppost.

16:22.782 --> 16:24.315
(tires screech)

16:24.317 --> 16:26.150
I got a call saying
my birth mother

16:26.152 --> 16:27.986
would meet me
at this lamppost.

16:27.988 --> 16:29.153
Greg?

16:29.155 --> 16:31.422
Memphis?
(thunder rumbles)

16:31.424 --> 16:34.659
Oh, my God, a category-6
subpolar tornado-cane,

16:34.661 --> 16:36.661
the rarest storm
in all of weather!

16:36.663 --> 16:39.097
Don't tell us,
tell the viewers.

16:39.099 --> 16:41.366
Our breaking story right now --

16:41.368 --> 16:45.503
a weather event that I couldn't
even<i> begin</i> to explain.

16:45.505 --> 16:46.971
Oh!

16:46.973 --> 16:48.940
So we're going to go live
to Greg Corbin

16:48.942 --> 16:52.477
and Memphis Stormfront,
in the heart of the storm.

16:52.479 --> 16:54.512
Ohhh?!

16:54.514 --> 16:56.347
I told you, I'm done
with the news, Stan.

16:56.349 --> 16:57.815
I'm a cake man now!

16:57.817 --> 16:59.450
You're a what?

16:59.452 --> 17:00.618
(thunder rumbles)

17:00.620 --> 17:02.153
Goddamn it,
I'm a news man!

17:02.155 --> 17:03.621
Greg Corbin, here,

17:03.623 --> 17:05.623
live in the midst
of the storm of the century,

17:05.625 --> 17:07.859
with our very own
Memphis Stormfront.

17:07.861 --> 17:10.495
Greg, we are witnessing
a once-in-a-lifetime

17:10.497 --> 17:14.065
weather event unleashing
multiple funnel clouds.

17:17.470 --> 17:19.537
The gators
are gettin' spooked!

17:19.539 --> 17:22.006
Get 'em into the barn,
and quick!

17:22.008 --> 17:23.307
Hyah!

17:23.309 --> 17:25.043
It's too late!

17:25.045 --> 17:28.146
(growling)

17:28.148 --> 17:30.982
(lightning crackles)

17:30.984 --> 17:32.850
(alarm blares)

17:32.852 --> 17:34.419
(people screaming)

17:34.421 --> 17:36.154
In a stunning development,

17:36.156 --> 17:39.924
we are now in the midst
of a full-fledged gator storm.

17:39.926 --> 17:41.793
(cheering)

17:43.396 --> 17:44.729
Aah!

17:48.168 --> 17:49.600
(gasping)

17:49.602 --> 17:50.768
Aah!

17:50.770 --> 17:52.236
(whimpering)

17:54.007 --> 17:56.074
(sighs)

17:56.076 --> 17:58.743
(hissing, rattling)

17:58.745 --> 18:00.545
(blows)

18:00.547 --> 18:03.047
By the way, great to be back on
the air with you, Memphis.

18:03.049 --> 18:04.382
What have you been
up to lately?

18:04.384 --> 18:07.051
Well, I finally caught
"Step Up: All in"

18:07.053 --> 18:08.753
on cable this weekend.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.688
That mess?
They should've --

18:10.690 --> 18:13.224
(gasps)
called it "Throw Up: All over."

18:13.226 --> 18:15.560
They<i> should've</i>
called it off.

18:15.562 --> 18:17.462
(laughs)

18:17.464 --> 18:21.365
Even in the belly of the storm,
they banter flawlessly.

18:21.367 --> 18:23.601
These are my stars!

18:26.973 --> 18:29.474
(gulping)

18:29.476 --> 18:33.077
Ahh!

18:33.079 --> 18:35.379
You know, you look
familiar to me.

18:35.381 --> 18:38.216
I did do a bit
of board-game modeling,

18:38.218 --> 18:39.750
back in my younger days.

18:39.752 --> 18:40.985
Oh, yeah,
maybe that's it.

18:40.987 --> 18:42.086
I think I --
I think I remember.

18:42.088 --> 18:43.788
Was it, um...

18:43.790 --> 18:45.156
Oh, God, it's
on the tip of my --

18:45.158 --> 18:47.325
I want to say
mystery phone?

18:47.327 --> 18:48.626
Dream Phone.
-Dream Phone, Dream Phone.

18:48.628 --> 18:49.894
Right. Now I remember.
It's been --

18:49.896 --> 18:51.329
been such a long time.

18:51.331 --> 18:53.264
Is that the phone
from the game

18:53.266 --> 18:54.732
that you're holding
right now?

18:54.734 --> 18:56.567
So, it is.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.136
Say, you know,
I got the day free.

18:58.138 --> 18:59.670
What do you say
we head to the mall

18:59.672 --> 19:01.839
and grab ourselves
a slice of 'za?

19:01.841 --> 19:06.244
Ugh! I try to stay away
from malls and pizza.

19:06.246 --> 19:08.946
I'm beginning to get
the distinct impression,

19:08.948 --> 19:11.782
Dylan,
that you are a liar.

19:11.784 --> 19:14.352
Well, I wouldn't exactly
call it lying,

19:14.354 --> 19:18.022
but for starters,
my name's not actually Dylan.

19:20.793 --> 19:24.462
So, um,
what happened back there?

19:24.464 --> 19:26.164
We went to the mall
and had pizza,

19:26.166 --> 19:29.133
because that's
what Dylan likes.

19:29.135 --> 19:31.435
Why is there blood
on the Dream Phone?

19:31.437 --> 19:33.304
He likes malls
and pizza...

19:33.306 --> 19:34.438
and me.

19:38.444 --> 19:40.311
Roger?

19:40.313 --> 19:41.846
W-what's in this jar?

19:41.848 --> 19:45.950
Dylan was being bad,
and now we have the jar.

19:45.952 --> 19:48.553
<i> ¶ I'm so excited ¶</i>

19:48.555 --> 19:51.422
<i> ¶ And I just can't hide it ¶</i>

19:56.829 --> 20:00.064
Well, it's official --
I'm out at channel 3

20:00.066 --> 20:03.401
and you two are back in,
thanks to us.

20:03.403 --> 20:04.635
What do you mean,
thanks to you?

20:04.637 --> 20:06.170
We did all of this.

20:06.172 --> 20:07.705
Francine got you on the air,

20:07.707 --> 20:10.474
and I abused my CIA powers
to make that superstorm.

20:10.476 --> 20:13.211
You<i> made</i> this storm?

20:13.213 --> 20:15.346
Lives were destroyed.

20:15.348 --> 20:18.349
But<i> Greg's</i> life
was fixed.

20:18.351 --> 20:20.518
Now you've got
a new work partner

20:20.520 --> 20:23.221
<i>and</i> a new life partner.

20:23.223 --> 20:25.056
Now kiss,
you two lovebirds.

20:25.058 --> 20:26.224
And put some mustard on it.

20:28.761 --> 20:30.361
Aren't you straight?

20:30.363 --> 20:32.730
Yes, but I'm terrified
of these people.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.932
They can control
the weather!

20:34.934 --> 20:37.001
BOTH: Mmm.

20:40.340 --> 20:42.373
You did it, baby.

20:42.375 --> 20:43.608
<i> We</i> did it.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.209
Because<i> we're</i> helpers.

20:45.211 --> 20:46.877
It's just in our nature.

20:46.879 --> 20:48.512
We help.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.618
Mommy?

20:57.290 --> 20:59.423
(growls)

21:02.128 --> 21:04.161
Bye!
Have a beautiful time!
