09:34.960 --> 09:37.580
Go ahead, keep scheming,
steal the wand.

09:37.580 --> 09:40.170
I can see it's the only thing
in the world you care about!

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
So what do we do
now, boss?

09:45.000 --> 09:48.330
I'm going to
take back what's mine.

09:49.790 --> 09:54.080
You're probably
wondering who I am.

09:54.080 --> 09:56.920
So Let me introduce myself.

09:56.920 --> 10:01.670
I have waged a war on
the Butterfly family for years.

10:01.670 --> 10:05.620
I burned the magic book
of spells to ashes,

10:05.620 --> 10:09.960
I fused with the most
powerful relic in existence,

10:09.960 --> 10:12.000
I amassed an army
large enough

10:12.000 --> 10:14.500
to conquer
this wretched land.

10:14.500 --> 10:15.830
[screeching]

10:15.830 --> 10:19.000
I'm Ludo Avarius!

10:19.000 --> 10:22.710
And you have my wand!

10:22.710 --> 10:25.960
What are you talkin' about?
I don't have no wand!

10:25.960 --> 10:29.540
Oh, sorry, I want
the deed to our castle.

10:29.540 --> 10:31.080
Whoopsies.

10:31.080 --> 10:32.790
Y'all are crazy!

10:32.790 --> 10:35.790
No, I just love my brother,

10:35.790 --> 10:40.290
but I'll do crazy things
to protect him.

10:40.290 --> 10:41.670
Boop.

10:41.670 --> 10:45.540
-[Land Baron screaming]
-[Ludo laughing]

10:45.540 --> 10:47.750
Ah! Ah! Where am I?

10:47.750 --> 10:50.920
[Ludo]
Take off your blindfold.

10:50.920 --> 10:52.170
Surprise!

10:52.170 --> 10:54.120
[Dennis]
Wait. Yudo?

10:54.120 --> 10:56.120
Dudo? Cudo?

10:56.120 --> 10:57.170
Mudo? Tudo?

10:57.170 --> 11:00.290
Fludo? Zudo? Even Menudo?

11:00.290 --> 11:02.790
But the Baron? The deed?

11:02.790 --> 11:05.210
Let's say his heart is
in a better place now.

11:05.210 --> 11:06.960
-[gagging]
-[clinks]

11:06.960 --> 11:09.170
[Ludo] Think fast!

11:09.170 --> 11:11.620
This isn't
Mom and Dad's castle anymore.

11:11.620 --> 11:13.960
It's ours, isn't it?

11:13.960 --> 11:17.000
[laughing]

11:18.540 --> 11:21.540
-Yahoo!
-I did it!

11:21.540 --> 11:23.080
[Ludo] We did it!

11:23.080 --> 11:23.920
[buzzer]
