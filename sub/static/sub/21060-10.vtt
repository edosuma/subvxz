-Stop! Now! Stop!

00:18.967 --> 00:21.033

-Heads up!

00:21.067 --> 00:23.533
-* Bad boys, bad boys,
whatcha gonna do... *

00:23.567 --> 00:25.967
-I smoked some marijuana!
I'm a marijuana smoker!

00:26.000 --> 00:27.833
-* Bad boys, bad boys *
-Crawl out!

00:27.867 --> 00:29.233
* Whatcha gonna do... *

00:29.267 --> 00:30.467
-Hands up! Hands up!

00:30.500 --> 00:32.367
Hold it! Hold it!
Hold it! Hold it!

00:32.400 --> 00:34.433
-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.467 --> 00:36.533
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.567 --> 00:39.100
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:39.133 --> 00:41.933
in a court of law.

00:41.967 --> 00:44.933
-Policeman: I moved out here
from Michigan about 12 years ago

00:44.967 --> 00:46.800
with the ambitions
of bein' an officer.

00:46.833 --> 00:48.933
I never got to serve
in the military, so I figured

00:48.967 --> 00:51.367
this is my way of giving back
to the community.

00:51.400 --> 00:53.900
J and I are on
the Neighborhood
Response Squad.

00:53.933 --> 00:57.467
Our squad's very proactive
as far as, um, trying

00:57.500 --> 01:00.300
to stop the... the drugs comin'
into the community.

01:00.333 --> 01:02.133
-We're tryin' to catch up
with a couple guys on bikes

01:02.167 --> 01:04.467
who were just kind of ridin'
in the middle of the road.

01:04.500 --> 01:07.067
Oh. They just went down
this street right up here,

01:07.067 --> 01:09.333
so, try to get them to stop.

01:09.367 --> 01:11.067
You better stop, dude!

01:12.767 --> 01:14.633
-Put it down! Put it down!

01:14.667 --> 01:16.933
Put it down!
-Put it down, now!

01:16.967 --> 01:18.500
Get down on the ground, now!

01:18.533 --> 01:20.100
-Okay.

01:20.133 --> 01:21.633
-Get it out of your hand.

01:21.667 --> 01:24.267
If it's dope, it's dope.
-We could use
another person here.

01:24.300 --> 01:25.367
-What do you think we are, dumb?

01:25.400 --> 01:28.067
-I got him.
-Get down on the ground!

01:28.067 --> 01:30.133
-Stay down! Stay down!
-Where those knives at, bro?

01:30.167 --> 01:33.233
-(indistinct radio chatter)
-Sit down on the ground!

01:33.267 --> 01:37.167
I want you to sit down
on the ground.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.533
-Get down on the ground, now!

01:38.567 --> 01:40.367
Now!
-(Taser fires, crackles)

01:40.400 --> 01:43.500
-(screaming) Ow! Ow!
Don't! Ow! Don't! Ow!

01:43.533 --> 01:47.100
Ow! Oh God, stop!

01:47.133 --> 01:48.967
-You done, bro?
-Put your hands back.

01:49.067 --> 01:51.833
-Get your hands
behind your back, now!
-Okay, stop!

01:51.867 --> 01:54.600
-Hand behind your back, now!

01:54.633 --> 01:57.067
-Sir, I wanna know why
I'm being pulled over!
-(Taser crackling)

01:57.100 --> 01:59.067
-Ow! Ow!
-Get your hands
behind your back.

01:59.067 --> 02:03.133
Ow! Ow! Ow!
-107, step it up.

02:03.167 --> 02:05.433
-Ow!
-(indistinct radio chatter)

02:05.467 --> 02:08.067
-Hey, you're a witness
to this, bro!

02:08.067 --> 02:09.467
You hear me?
-Got it.

02:09.500 --> 02:13.733
Get that one.
-You're a witness to this,
all right, dog?

02:13.767 --> 02:15.567
Seriously, are you or no?
-Hey...

02:15.600 --> 02:17.200
-Yeah.
-Just sit and chill.

02:17.233 --> 02:18.667
Do you have
any more weapons on you?

02:18.700 --> 02:20.767
-I just have
a little pocket knife,
that's it.

02:20.800 --> 02:21.933
-What do you keep reachin' for?

02:21.967 --> 02:23.467
-I'm not reaching
for anything, man.

02:23.500 --> 02:24.800
-I'm gonna sit you up, okay?

02:24.833 --> 02:27.233
-(crying)
-Lean up on this side.

02:27.267 --> 02:29.067
-(crying)

02:30.967 --> 02:33.233
-Why wouldn't you stay
on the ground? I told you
to sit on the ground.

02:33.267 --> 02:35.700
Why you keep tryin' to get up?

02:35.733 --> 02:37.800
Put that foot out straight.

02:39.567 --> 02:43.467
No weapons?
-No. Ow! Ow! That thing's
still stuck in me. Ow!

02:43.500 --> 02:46.633
-Stuck in your shorts.
Okay, just a knife?
-Ow!

02:46.667 --> 02:48.133
-Yeah.
-This what
you kept reachin' for?

02:48.167 --> 02:50.800
-No, I wasn't--
-Or it's just the dope
you hid over there?

02:50.833 --> 02:52.433
Huh?
-(whimpering) ...anything,
man, I don't.

02:52.467 --> 02:55.067
-Hey. What's your name?
-Yeah? (panting)

02:55.067 --> 02:57.167
-Look at me.
What's your name?

02:57.200 --> 02:58.833
-Am I gonna be able
to go home today, sir?

02:58.867 --> 03:02.200
-Well, we'll see.
-I mean... I--

03:02.233 --> 03:05.500
I don't--
-Listen. When we stop you,
and you reach in your pocket,

03:05.533 --> 03:07.833
you pull stuff out,
and then you're sittin' down
on it,

03:07.867 --> 03:10.333
and then you dig it
in the ground and then
you sit on top of it...

03:10.367 --> 03:13.367
-No, I did not have anything
in my pocket. I didn't go
in my pockets once, man.

03:13.400 --> 03:15.167
-Yeah, you did.
-I swear.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.633
-You were tryin' to get rid of
whatever it was that's over
there on the ground.

03:17.667 --> 03:19.433
-Do you have my phone?
-And I will go find it.

03:19.467 --> 03:22.467
You know I'm gonna go walk
right back over there
and pick it up, right?

03:22.500 --> 03:25.667
-Okay.
-I didn't forget
where you sat. Right?

03:25.700 --> 03:28.800
Hey, you said you have an ID?
-In my back, right pocket.

03:28.833 --> 03:30.733
-Okay, lean forward a little.

03:30.767 --> 03:32.067
Just lean forward.

03:32.067 --> 03:33.867
What's up, dude,
what's his problem?

03:33.900 --> 03:36.500
Huh?
-Do you have any drugs on you?

03:36.533 --> 03:38.067
-No, I do not.
-Nothing on you?

03:38.100 --> 03:40.433
-No. I have no drugs...
-Well, I appreciate you
staying out of it

03:40.467 --> 03:42.733
because I don't know
what his problem is, dude.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.567
Hey, you been arrested
for felonies before or what?

03:47.600 --> 03:49.900
No felon, and no probation,
no parole, no...

03:49.933 --> 03:51.100
-Well, good.

03:51.133 --> 03:53.467
Are you a user or no?
-No. I, uh, was.

03:53.500 --> 03:54.633
-Oh, you were?
-Yeah.

03:54.667 --> 03:56.600
-You been doin' good?
-Well, until now, yeah.

03:56.633 --> 04:00.100
-Well, just because he did
nonsense doesn't mean, you're
getting in trouble for it.

04:00.133 --> 04:01.633
-I just recently moved
down here, so.

04:01.667 --> 04:04.767
-Okay.
-I guess I'd better watch
who I'm hangin' around, huh?

04:04.800 --> 04:06.833
-I guess.

04:06.867 --> 04:09.867
-I'm gonna pull these headphones
off your neck, okay?

04:09.900 --> 04:13.067
When we stopped him,
he initially, uh,
reached into his pocket,

04:13.067 --> 04:16.800
rode ahead of the other guy,
and when we told him stop,
he took off again.

04:16.833 --> 04:19.633
Well, he's got a couple
credit cards with some
different names on it.

04:19.667 --> 04:21.933
So we'll see where those
came from.

04:24.233 --> 04:26.567
When I had him sit down,
he pulled somethin' out
in his hand,

04:26.600 --> 04:28.900
he dug it in the rocks.
-Like light-colored,
or like, small?

04:28.933 --> 04:32.433
-No, it was small.
When he sat, he tried
to scoot over it, so...

04:32.467 --> 04:35.067
-Like, you think it was
like a little bit of dope,
or a weapon?

04:35.067 --> 04:38.333
-Yeah, most likely drugs.
It was small, he had his hand
cupped over it.

04:38.367 --> 04:41.067
-Hope it's not a needle
or somethin'.

04:41.067 --> 04:43.700
-Here it is, here it is.
So, you can see

04:43.733 --> 04:46.400
the little baggie, they
call these a "seal."

04:46.433 --> 04:49.667
Looks like that's probably
all he had, it was pretty small.

04:49.700 --> 04:52.433
That little black tar substance
is gonna be heroin.

04:52.467 --> 04:54.167
Ready, bud?

04:57.700 --> 04:59.900
-Honestly, sir,
I just got my mom
and my grandma,

05:00.067 --> 05:03.167
I got to take care of and stuff,
and it's just so scary, man.
I'm sorry.

05:03.200 --> 05:05.433
-But, again, you taking care
of your mom and grandma

05:05.467 --> 05:07.400
should not include
a bag of heroin in your pocket.

05:14.300 --> 05:16.733
So, when we tried to stop you,
was that all you were grabbin',

05:16.767 --> 05:18.067
was just that one bag
of heroin?

05:18.100 --> 05:20.967
How much did that cost,
one bag of heroin?

05:21.067 --> 05:24.367
-I don't really know.
-You don't know how much
it costs?

05:24.400 --> 05:25.600
You didn't buy it or what?

05:25.633 --> 05:27.933
Somebody give it to you?
Where'd you get it?

05:27.967 --> 05:31.867
I had... I found it a long,
long time ago, and I had it.

05:31.900 --> 05:35.067
And I knew somebody
that wanted it, and I just
wanted some money is all.

05:35.100 --> 05:37.300
-So you've already got
a probation violation warrant,

05:37.333 --> 05:40.100
and you're out here
with heroin, violatin'
your probation some more.

05:40.133 --> 05:41.967
So...
-It's not nothin' I'm doin',
I mean, I'm--

05:42.067 --> 05:43.567
-No, it's exactly-- it's
somethin' you're doin'.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.167
You've got a bag
of heroin in your pocket.

05:45.200 --> 05:47.067
-It was-- It was in my hand.
You know?

05:47.067 --> 05:49.733
-It was in your hand when you--
when we tried to stop you.

05:49.767 --> 05:51.967
It was in your pocket
before we tried to stop you.

05:52.067 --> 05:53.800
It doesn't matter
where it was.
-I'm sorry.

05:53.833 --> 05:56.467
-The fact is, it was on you,
you had it, and that's
a violation of your probation.

05:56.500 --> 05:58.967
-Yes.
-So, you gotta stop
doing those things,

05:59.067 --> 06:01.067
to get yourself clean, right?

06:02.867 --> 06:05.867
And if you need a little bit
of money, I promise you,

06:05.900 --> 06:08.067
tradin' some heroin out for it
is not gonna help you.

06:08.067 --> 06:11.667
-(crying) Yeah,
but I don't want it.
I don't want any of this.

06:11.700 --> 06:13.900
-All right. Well, we'll see
what we can do

06:13.933 --> 06:16.100
about gettin' you out of there
as soon as we can, okay?

06:16.133 --> 06:17.933
All right?

06:17.967 --> 06:20.200
-(crying)

06:21.767 --> 06:24.533
-Um, our guy has
a bag of heroin,

06:24.567 --> 06:27.333
and he's got those credit cards,
uh, different names on 'em.

06:27.367 --> 06:29.567
We'll have to do some research
and see what they come back to.

06:29.600 --> 06:33.600
It looks like mail theft to me,
rather than, like, uh,
vehicle burg or anything,

06:33.633 --> 06:35.600
'cause they still got
the stickers on 'em.

06:35.633 --> 06:37.500
But this guy's goin' for sure.

06:37.533 --> 06:39.833
How's he?
-He-- Uh, he's complying.

06:39.867 --> 06:42.833
He says he's never done
any probation, parole, nothin'.

06:42.867 --> 06:44.767
Um, did he tell you why he ran?

06:44.800 --> 06:47.533
-He said he had to get home
to his grandma and his mom
'cause he's taking care of them,

06:47.567 --> 06:50.367
but, um, I think he ran
because he was trying
to get as far away

06:50.400 --> 06:52.100
from that bag of heroin
as he could.

06:52.133 --> 06:54.733
-Okay. Yeah, I don't see
any reason why--

06:54.767 --> 06:57.067
We could just document
him and just, uh, that
he was with him,

06:57.067 --> 06:58.933
and, uh, kick him loose.
-All right.

06:58.967 --> 07:01.700
-He, out of the two,
didn't do anything wrong.

07:01.733 --> 07:03.533
I mean, he could've bolted
if he wanted to.

07:06.067 --> 07:09.167
-Policeman:
I'm currently on my 23rd year
as a police officer.

07:09.200 --> 07:11.267
I'm a captain with the, uh,
Paterson Police Department,

07:11.300 --> 07:13.633
currently assigned
to the Narcotics Division

07:13.667 --> 07:15.133
as the commanding officer.

07:15.167 --> 07:18.133
I truly believe that in one way
or another almost
every major crime

07:18.167 --> 07:20.967
that occurs in this city
is related to narcotics.

07:21.067 --> 07:23.833
Whether it be the shootings
or the robberies,

07:23.867 --> 07:26.467
people tryin' to get money
to buy their drugs,

07:26.500 --> 07:29.400
or people tryin' to control
their territory,

07:29.433 --> 07:34.633
all violent crime, in one way
or another, is related
to narcotics activities.

07:34.667 --> 07:37.267
We had a surveillance team
out here, just observed
an individual

07:37.300 --> 07:40.900
jump into a car and just did
a hand-to-hand drug transaction.

07:40.933 --> 07:43.400
The, uh, suspected dealer
must've spotted my truck.

07:43.433 --> 07:45.333
He was attempting
to get into his vehicle,

07:45.367 --> 07:46.767
but then he started
walking away.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.067
So we're tryin' to catch up
to the dealer right now.

07:49.067 --> 07:52.733
-Man (over radio): Give me that
location again? You got cut off.
-Come here, coz.

07:52.767 --> 07:55.900
Gould and Hazel.
Keep your hands
out of your pocket, bro.

07:55.933 --> 07:57.467
-Turn around.
-(police radio beeps)

07:57.500 --> 08:00.900
-Hey, if anybody's coming
towards-- down Hazel,
towards Gould,

08:00.933 --> 08:04.667
the block before, make a right
into the Clifton side,

08:04.700 --> 08:08.067
on the left-hand side,
see if there's a car
with two white kids in there.

08:08.100 --> 08:09.867
-Man (over radio): All right.
We got 'em right here.

08:09.900 --> 08:12.467
-Yo, hold on. What am I getting
an arrest for? What the hell?

08:12.500 --> 08:15.900
What the (bleep) did I do?
-I'll take care for now,
all right? Relax.

08:15.933 --> 08:16.967
Give me your other hand.
-Hmm?

08:17.067 --> 08:19.133
-Where do you live?
-I live on Sixth Avenue.

08:19.167 --> 08:21.100
-(horn honks)
-Sixth Ave?

08:21.133 --> 08:23.233
All right, you know
those kids you just got
out of the car with?

08:23.267 --> 08:24.567
-Yeah, they gave me
a ride over there--

08:24.600 --> 08:26.433
-They gave you a ride
over there? Okay.

08:26.467 --> 08:29.067
-Yes, sir.
-Yeah, I need a scoop
over here by, uh...

08:29.100 --> 08:31.133
-(mumbles indistinctly)
-Hazel and Gould.

08:31.167 --> 08:33.700
All right, come over here.
How old are you?

08:33.733 --> 08:35.967
-I'm 22.
-Been arrested before?

08:36.067 --> 08:37.767
-No.

08:37.800 --> 08:40.400
-(man mumbles indistinctly)

08:40.433 --> 08:41.833
-Have a seat in there for now,
all right?

08:41.867 --> 08:44.333
I'll talk to you
in a second.
-All right.

08:44.367 --> 08:46.133
We're gonna go back
to his vehicle,

08:46.167 --> 08:48.767
which he was attempting
to get into until he spotted us.

08:48.800 --> 08:50.633
-(siren approaches)

08:50.667 --> 08:52.967
-Let's see what we got in here.

08:53.067 --> 08:58.400
I'm tryin' to see
if he has any additional of,
uh... prescription pills.

08:58.433 --> 09:00.667
Oxycontin, which
is a big problem
here in Paterson

09:00.700 --> 09:03.367
with the sales of a lot
of prescription pills.

09:04.933 --> 09:07.800
-Now, we just searched
this guy's car for the, uh...
more pills.

09:07.833 --> 09:09.667
We found some
on the buyers already.

09:11.300 --> 09:12.800
Usually glove box
is a big one.

09:12.833 --> 09:14.500
Sometimes, I mean--
Sometimes there are traps,

09:14.533 --> 09:17.067
but this is a pretty, uh,
basic car, so...

09:18.733 --> 09:19.800
No.

09:21.300 --> 09:22.733
Glove box.

09:22.767 --> 09:25.067
Oh, bingo.

09:25.067 --> 09:26.300
Simple enough.

09:28.100 --> 09:31.100
Looks like Oxycontins
from here.

09:31.133 --> 09:32.200
Yep.

09:33.367 --> 09:35.067
Right in the glove box.

09:37.467 --> 09:39.067
-We saw the vehicle
that you had called out.

09:39.067 --> 09:41.133
There were the two individuals
sitting inside.

09:41.167 --> 09:44.700
As we drove up, uh,
James actually came up
to the driver.

09:44.733 --> 09:46.400
I went over
to the passenger side.

09:46.433 --> 09:49.633
As I was walkin' up,
the one individual started
to put something

09:49.667 --> 09:52.533
down on the floorboard,
so I recovered it.

09:52.567 --> 09:54.633
It was, uh...
-Man (over radio): Yeah,
we got a unit parked--

09:54.667 --> 09:57.700
-...a crushed-up pill inside
with some, uh, blue powder,

09:57.733 --> 10:01.767
and then there was another pill,
uh, wrapped up in a $20 bill.

10:01.800 --> 10:04.267
-Okay. Well, that matches
everything we found
from the dealer's car.

10:04.300 --> 10:06.833
He had blue, uh,
prescription pills in there.

10:06.867 --> 10:10.100
He was coming out of the car.
He made the transaction
when I pulled up.

10:10.133 --> 10:13.100
He started to get
in his vehicle, but I guess
he made my truck,

10:13.133 --> 10:14.867
so he just started walking
on foot.

10:14.900 --> 10:18.533
So we got him, came back
to the car, got the prescription
pills, which matched exactly

10:18.567 --> 10:21.767
what he sold to the buyers,
so, you can't get better
than that.

10:23.433 --> 10:24.900
How are you doin', my man?
-What's up, buddy?

10:24.933 --> 10:25.967
-Huh?
-How's it goin'?

10:26.000 --> 10:27.400
-Okay, I want you
to do me a favor.

10:27.433 --> 10:29.867
All right, help yourself out
and just-- We know
what happened.

10:29.900 --> 10:31.900
-All right.
-We got the guy
who sold you the pills.

10:31.933 --> 10:33.600
-Driver: Okay.
-All right?

10:33.633 --> 10:35.367
How much did you pay for them?

10:35.400 --> 10:38.100
-Uh, what'd I pay for them...
$25 each.

10:38.133 --> 10:39.733
-How many did you buy from him?

10:39.767 --> 10:41.033
-Two.
-Two?

10:41.067 --> 10:44.033
All right.
How many of these pills
do you do a day?

10:45.267 --> 10:46.633
-Not many, one.

10:46.667 --> 10:48.533
-Okay.
You were crushing up.
What, do you snort it?

10:48.567 --> 10:53.133
-No, I was doing that for him.
He told me he was goin' to get
his cigarettes, and...

10:53.167 --> 10:56.233
-Okay.
-...and when
he comes back, he'll...

10:56.267 --> 10:58.933
-All right, well,
he's been arrested.

10:58.967 --> 11:01.267
We found the same pills
that he sold to you
in his car, so--

11:01.300 --> 11:02.500
-Oh, you did?
-Yes.

11:02.533 --> 11:03.767
-Okay.
-All right.

11:03.800 --> 11:05.267
Um, you guys are just
gonna be charged--

11:05.300 --> 11:07.567
I'm telling you guys
all the truth,
whatever happened.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.367
-And I appreciate
your honesty, all right?

11:09.400 --> 11:11.067
And you work with us,
we work with you, okay?
-Yeah.

11:11.100 --> 11:12.467
-All right?
I appreciate your honesty,

11:12.500 --> 11:14.633
and tell you right now,
you're gonna be basically
taken down

11:14.667 --> 11:16.800
and charged
with simple possession,

11:16.833 --> 11:18.767
all right,
of the prescription pills.
-Just possession?

11:18.800 --> 11:21.367
-Just possession, okay?
And as long as you don't
have any warrants

11:21.400 --> 11:23.967
for your arrest or anything,
then you guys will be out
of here in a little bit.

11:24.067 --> 11:25.600
-Driver: What's gonna happen
to my car, sir?

11:25.633 --> 11:27.733
-Your car's gonna be left
right there.
-Where's my keys and my phone?

11:27.767 --> 11:30.067
-They got the keys.
Everything will be
in your property.

11:30.100 --> 11:32.233
-They got my cell phone?
-Everything will be
in your property bag.

11:32.267 --> 11:34.767
-They got my license, too?
-Everything they took from you,
they'll have it.

11:34.800 --> 11:36.467
-So we just got to go there,
they're gonna let us--

11:36.500 --> 11:38.833
-You're processed, and, yes,
then you'll be released.

11:38.867 --> 11:40.400
Any other questions
or anything?

11:40.433 --> 11:41.733
-But you're not gonna
tow my car, right?

11:41.767 --> 11:43.533
-No, your car's gonna
be left right there where it is.

11:43.567 --> 11:45.300
-I didn't have anything.
I was just with my friends.

11:45.333 --> 11:48.067
-It's legally parked. Okay?
Once we get inside
narcotics office,

11:48.067 --> 11:50.333
if you got any other questions,
I'll be more than glad
to answer them.

11:50.367 --> 11:52.733
-Where are we going? What town?
-To Paterson Police
Narcotics Bureau.

11:52.767 --> 11:54.733
-All right. Okay, good.

11:57.533 --> 12:00.300
-Do you have anything illegal--
-I only got my medicine,
my medicine.

12:00.333 --> 12:03.267
-Just your medicine?
-Yeah, I got my 'script
right there in the car.

12:03.300 --> 12:06.633
-Unfortunately, that matches
exactly what you just sold
these two guys.

12:06.667 --> 12:08.333
They were trying to crush up
and sniff.

12:08.367 --> 12:10.733
-I didn't sell them nothin'.
-Okay. Uh, listen.

12:10.767 --> 12:13.567
You can tell me no,
all right, but I know
what I saw. All right?

12:13.600 --> 12:15.733
-All right, sir. I understand.
-You're gonna be held.

12:15.767 --> 12:17.400
You're probably gonna
be charged...
-With what?

12:17.433 --> 12:19.467
-...the sale of
prescription pills--
-That's not fair.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.233
-How is it not fair?
-I didn't sell 'em nothin'.

12:21.267 --> 12:23.167
-You're the one
that did it, not me.
-What you mean, sir?

12:23.200 --> 12:25.067
I got my medicine
right there. I don't
do nothing illegal.

12:25.100 --> 12:27.067
-That's fine and dandy,
but once you sell it
to them,

12:27.067 --> 12:29.567
then you're
doing something illegal.
-I didn't sell 'em nothing, sir.

12:29.600 --> 12:31.133
-That's why you'll
have your day in court.

12:31.167 --> 12:33.133
-Okay, if you wanna
go fight it, that's where
we'll fight it.

12:33.167 --> 12:35.967
-Come on, sir,
you can't detain me--
-We're not gonna debate it here.

12:36.067 --> 12:37.367
-Come on, sir,
you can't do that to me.

12:37.400 --> 12:39.167
-I'm advising you what you're
getting charged with, okay?

12:39.200 --> 12:41.633
You're gonna get charged with
the sale of the prescription
drug to them.

12:41.667 --> 12:43.067
-What you mean, sir.
-Okay?

12:43.067 --> 12:44.900
-Sir, I got my medication
right there--

12:44.933 --> 12:47.900
-We're not gonna have
a trial here.

12:47.933 --> 12:50.900
I'm advising you
what you're gonna be
charged with, okay?

12:50.933 --> 12:54.567
-But that's not fair, sir--
-So, we'll continue talking
inside headquarters.

12:54.600 --> 12:56.767
You're gonna be taken
to a narcotics office.

12:56.800 --> 12:59.567
-Come on, sir.
-And if you wanna talk,
then we'll talk in there.

12:59.600 --> 13:02.067
-Well, I got my medication
right there.
-I know you do.

13:02.067 --> 13:04.200
And I know
what you're doing
with your medication, too.

13:04.233 --> 13:07.267
-No, I don't.
-Okay. Have a good day.

13:11.567 --> 13:13.500
-Policeman: You know, I, uh,
grew up in Des Moines, Iowa,

13:13.533 --> 13:16.500
and there's a state fair
over here, uh, every year,

13:16.533 --> 13:18.867
and it's a million people
they put through the gates.

13:18.900 --> 13:22.067
Huge. Probably one
of the biggest events we have
all year long.

13:22.067 --> 13:24.267
And everybody's happy.
They come down and eat
some funnel cakes,

13:24.300 --> 13:27.467
some chicken on a stick,
and, uh...

13:27.500 --> 13:29.667
ride those midway rides,
and it's a good time.

13:31.600 --> 13:34.900
We got called
that somebody wants to go
repossess a car,

13:34.933 --> 13:37.067
and they might have a feeling
it's gonna turn bad.

13:37.100 --> 13:38.600
So, they've asked
for our assistance.

13:38.633 --> 13:41.067
We're gonna go give a chat
and see what we see.

13:42.500 --> 13:43.933
-Hi, there.
-Sir.

13:43.967 --> 13:46.267
-What can I do for you?
-I'm trying
to repossess a vehicle.

13:46.300 --> 13:49.067
-Okay.
-And that's a contract
that I've got with them.

13:49.100 --> 13:51.833
The title's in their name
and I'm the lien holder.

13:51.867 --> 13:54.633
-Okay.
Do you often write contracts
on the back of cardboard?

13:54.667 --> 13:57.433
-Cardboard or paper.
-Yeah?

13:57.467 --> 14:01.933
-And the deal was, the money
that was paid to me would be
put right here,

14:01.967 --> 14:04.167
and their name on one side
and mine on the other.

14:04.200 --> 14:07.067
-Oh, okay.
That seems reasonable.
-And then that way,

14:07.067 --> 14:09.767
it can keep things,
going straight.
-Sure. Sure.

14:09.800 --> 14:12.900
Who got a hold of this, though?
You got a grandkid?
-Huh?

14:12.933 --> 14:14.933
-The grandkids
get a hold of this?
-No.

14:14.967 --> 14:17.600
-Do a little crayon on there?
-No, that was on there
when it was wrote.

14:17.633 --> 14:20.767
-Oh, okay.
-Vehicle's setting right down
here and they owe me

14:20.800 --> 14:23.200
over $600.
-They owe you over $600.

14:23.233 --> 14:26.200
Well, let's go take a look
at it, and we'll figure it out
from there, okay, buddy?

14:26.233 --> 14:27.967
-Okay.
-Here, you better
take this, sir.

14:28.067 --> 14:29.500
-Okay.

14:29.533 --> 14:34.233
-Well, that's new.
Find a contract written
on a piece of cardboard.

14:34.267 --> 14:37.433
Well, this one's unique enough,
I think we'd better head over
and see what the other half

14:37.467 --> 14:40.633
of this cardboard contract
has to say for himself.

14:49.933 --> 14:52.333
Which truck is it?
-Right there, it's the van.

14:52.367 --> 14:54.067
-The van?
Oh, on the inside there?

14:54.067 --> 14:56.467
-Yeah.
-Okay. Hi, buddy.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.933
-Hi.
-Do you know what's goin' on
behind this van?

14:58.967 --> 15:01.067
-Yes, I do, sir.
-What's happenin'
with this van?

15:01.067 --> 15:04.567
-Here's what's goin' on.
They been stalkin' my house.
My brother doesn't live here.

15:04.600 --> 15:06.733
-Okay.
-He brought the van,
dropped it off and left.

15:06.767 --> 15:08.433
-Okay.
-I've been workin' on it
for him...

15:08.467 --> 15:09.567
-Okay.
-...so it'll run right.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.700
-Yeah.
-Since he sold it, it's been
a lemon.

15:11.733 --> 15:14.533
-Okay.
-Okay, I talked to my attorney,
he said he's gotta have

15:14.567 --> 15:16.700
two papers
before it can be removed
from the property.

15:16.733 --> 15:19.233
-Not really.
He's got-- He's the lien holder.

15:19.267 --> 15:22.633
-Right.
But my attorney is going down
to put another lien against it.

15:22.667 --> 15:26.600
-Okay, well, but it's not here
right now, and according
to the state at the moment,

15:26.633 --> 15:28.833
he's the only lien holder,
so he owns that truck.

15:28.867 --> 15:31.400
He can take his truck
whenever he wants,
to be quite honest with you.

15:31.433 --> 15:32.600
It's a civil dispute,
number one.

15:32.633 --> 15:34.833
I'm just here to make sure
no one gets killed.

15:34.867 --> 15:38.667
But my concern is that--
-It's sitting
on a private property?

15:38.700 --> 15:40.167
-Doesn't make
any difference, sir.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.500
People go and repossess cars
from private property
all the time.

15:42.533 --> 15:44.933
-But they can't
touch my vehicle.
-No, but I'm gonna ask you

15:44.967 --> 15:48.433
to move yours
so he can get that one,
and everybody cooperate.

15:48.467 --> 15:50.567
Why wouldn't everybody
wanna cooperate?

15:50.600 --> 15:53.333
-Because they come out here
at 2:30 in the morning.
-Yeah?

15:53.367 --> 15:56.767
-I heard slammin' doors
and everything, trying
to make off with that.

15:56.800 --> 15:58.467
-Okay.
-Said that was theirs.

15:58.500 --> 16:01.233
-Okay. Did you call the law?
-My uncle come out and ask them

16:01.267 --> 16:02.900
what they was doin'.
-Did you guys call the law?

16:02.933 --> 16:04.733
-No.
-Why wouldn't you
call the law?

16:04.767 --> 16:06.633
-Because the landlord
told me that they're off.

16:06.667 --> 16:08.133
I didn't expect anybody
to come over here

16:08.167 --> 16:09.767
and keep harassing me
when they don't come here.

16:09.800 --> 16:12.167
-He's not harassing you today
because he brought us with him.

16:12.200 --> 16:14.067
-He is harassing us,
he has four guys in that truck.

16:14.067 --> 16:15.367
-He doesn't have four guys
in that truck.

16:15.400 --> 16:17.067
-Now, 'cause he's
threatened me with a gun.

16:17.067 --> 16:18.300
That one right there
in the white van.

16:18.333 --> 16:19.767
Her boyfriend tried
to step on the property.

16:19.800 --> 16:21.267
-Oh. Okay.
-I said, "You wanna
threaten me?"

16:21.300 --> 16:23.500
I had my brother on the phone
and heard it all.

16:23.533 --> 16:28.367
-Okay. Well, here's the deal.
It's his van. Are you gonna
let him have it or not?

16:28.400 --> 16:32.467
-Until I see legal papers--
-Doesn't need legal papers,
he's the owner of it, sir.

16:32.500 --> 16:36.100
He's the lien holder.
There's no such thing
as legal papers for it.

16:36.133 --> 16:38.400
-Then why does my attorney
say different?
-I don't know, your attorney

16:38.433 --> 16:40.467
could've graduated last,
and they still call him
an attorney.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.467
I-- I don't know
what to tell you.
-Okay. Really?

16:42.500 --> 16:45.233
-Does your attorney work
strictly with repossession
of cars?

16:45.267 --> 16:46.800
-He works on anything
I need.

16:46.833 --> 16:50.700
-Well, obviously.
So maybe this is not his
bailiwick, necessarily, right?

16:50.733 --> 16:53.567
The difficulty I have today
is that I've asked you
a series of questions,

16:53.600 --> 16:56.200
and every time I ask you
a question, you seem
to give me an answer

16:56.233 --> 16:58.367
that doesn't relate at all
to the questions I've asked.

16:58.400 --> 17:02.067
I'm asking you
very politely, can they
have the vehicle?

17:02.100 --> 17:04.733
Because he is the owner
of it, and so eventually
what'll happen is,

17:04.767 --> 17:06.300
he'll just find it
somewhere else and take it.

17:06.333 --> 17:07.767
-Does he have a key
to get into it?

17:07.800 --> 17:09.833
-I don't have
the faintest idea.
I would imagine that he does.

17:09.867 --> 17:12.067
-I hope he has the key
'cause there ain't one here.
-Okay.

17:12.067 --> 17:14.133
-You're gonna do that--
I can't move it
if there ain't a key.

17:14.167 --> 17:16.267
-You're absolutely right.
You can't move it
if there's not a key.

17:16.300 --> 17:18.100
You seem particularly
angry today about all of this.

17:18.133 --> 17:19.700
-Well, yeah, 'cause he's
been harassing me, sir.

17:19.733 --> 17:21.400
-Oh, okay.
-They come out here
every night and park

17:21.433 --> 17:22.833
and block my driveway.
-Okay.

17:22.867 --> 17:24.700
-My wife has to leave--
-Why don't you guys
call the law?

17:24.733 --> 17:26.967
I would gladly come over
and put an end to that.

17:27.067 --> 17:30.100
Wait there for me.
Y'all got a key for it?
-They're not here.

17:30.133 --> 17:32.200
-They're not here?
-'Cause they left.

17:32.233 --> 17:34.767
-Okay. What do you want me
to do about that?

17:34.800 --> 17:36.167
What do you guys want me
to do about that?

17:36.200 --> 17:38.733
-Are you sure they're not
in the house somewhere?

17:38.767 --> 17:40.933
-I have no idea
whether they're in the house.

17:40.967 --> 17:43.633
I have no ability
to go in the house
and check that, sir.

17:43.667 --> 17:45.633
I gotta be honest
with you guys.

17:45.667 --> 17:48.300
Writing contracts--
-Don't Harlan. Harlan, don't!

17:48.333 --> 17:51.267
-Writing contracts
on the back of a piece
of cardboard

17:51.300 --> 17:53.400
is probably
not the best idea.

17:53.433 --> 17:55.333
And so right now,
if you guys don't
have a key for it,

17:55.367 --> 17:57.967
I'm not quite sure
how we're gonna
get it moved.

17:58.067 --> 17:59.633
Where's she goin'?
-I don't know.

17:59.667 --> 18:00.900
-I don't know either.

18:00.933 --> 18:02.500
My goodness.
Who's on the phone?

18:02.533 --> 18:04.400
-This is the one that-- Yep.
-That's Sharon, right? Okay.

18:04.433 --> 18:06.667
-Sharon (on phone):
I'm not even trying
to complain or be an ass.

18:06.700 --> 18:09.500
If I'm supposedly behind,
why haven't I been
shown proof?

18:09.533 --> 18:12.467
All they can show me
is that stupid cardboard
piece of paper.

18:12.500 --> 18:14.733
-Okay, Sharon?
Let's talk about
a few things.

18:14.767 --> 18:18.467
-Number one, did you sign
that silly cardboard contract?
-I understand.

18:18.500 --> 18:21.600
-Yes, but I also asked
for a receipt that same day,

18:21.633 --> 18:23.833
and they told me they'd make one
and never gave me one.

18:23.867 --> 18:26.100
-Okay, he is listed
as the lien holder
on the truck.

18:26.133 --> 18:28.333
So you understand
he's the bank, right?

18:28.367 --> 18:31.367
-Mm-hm.
-It's my understanding you are
behind in the payments, correct?

18:31.400 --> 18:35.333
-Well, yeah, but they're
makin' it sound like
I'm, like, profusely behind.

18:35.367 --> 18:37.433
I have no problem
givin' them the van

18:37.467 --> 18:39.467
if that's what it has
to come down to or whatever.

18:39.500 --> 18:42.067
I just want my things
out of it, and I would like
my receipt.

18:42.067 --> 18:45.233
-Sure, I can understand that.
Well, I appreciate your help
today, all right?

18:45.267 --> 18:49.367
-Thank you.
-All right, very good.
All right, bye-bye.

18:49.400 --> 18:52.133
Hey, Harlan, now did you hear
that Sharon said
they could take the van?

18:52.167 --> 18:53.500
You heard that part, right?

18:53.533 --> 18:55.367
-Yes.
-Okay, I like that, Harlan.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.767
I'm gonna go talk
down here for a second.
-All righty.

18:58.933 --> 19:00.700
-Okay.
I talked to Sharon.

19:00.733 --> 19:05.067
Sharon admits
that she's behind, and you guys
can take the van today, okay?

19:05.100 --> 19:07.767
-I told her they can have it
back as soon as they
pay up on it.

19:07.800 --> 19:11.167
-And she understands that.
All she's asking from you guys
is a receipt, okay?

19:11.200 --> 19:14.833
Saying that she's behind.
She says she doesn't know
exactly how much she's behind,

19:14.867 --> 19:16.500
so if she sees
that written down...

19:16.533 --> 19:21.400
-$150 a month,
she's behind four months...

19:21.433 --> 19:23.367
-Okay.
-...so that's $600.

19:23.400 --> 19:26.733
-That is $600.
I imagine that if you found
another piece of cardboard

19:26.767 --> 19:30.167
and wrote that out for her,
she would probably try
to make good for you.

19:30.200 --> 19:32.767
-Right.
-Perfect. More cardboard.

19:32.800 --> 19:35.967
You're like a one-stop
contract shop.

19:36.067 --> 19:38.967
-Hey, at least it's on paper.
-It is on paper, sir.

19:39.067 --> 19:40.467
Indeed it is. Outstanding.

19:40.500 --> 19:42.200
You're a good man.
You have a great day, buddy.

19:42.233 --> 19:43.867
-Take care, and I thank you.

19:43.900 --> 19:46.867
-So, he got his car back,
and, uh, everybody goes
home happy,

19:46.900 --> 19:48.967
and I think this is probably
the end we're gonna hear
about it.

19:50.200 --> 19:52.433
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:52.467 --> 19:54.400
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:54.433 --> 19:55.567
Cover is code three.

19:55.600 --> 19:58.567
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:04.867 --> 20:07.500
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:07.533 --> 20:11.267
-(theme music playing)
