WEBVTT

02:33.137 --> 02:36.222
Now in the street
there is violence

02:36.306 --> 02:40.476
And, and a lots of
work to be done

02:41.186 --> 02:44.063
No place to hang out
our washing

02:44.148 --> 02:47.483
And, and I can't blame
all on the sun

02:49.486 --> 02:50.570
Hello?

02:50.654 --> 02:52.780
It's dead out here and
I'm hating you about now.

02:52.865 --> 02:54.240
What kind of agent
are you?

02:54.324 --> 02:55.908
You'll find the road,
Kimberly.

02:55.993 --> 02:58.411
Look, it's 4:00 a. m. in LA.
Can I go back to sleep?

02:58.495 --> 03:00.079
I was up all night
on the red-eye

03:00.164 --> 03:02.081
and it wasn't first class
like you promised.

03:02.166 --> 03:05.001
Give me credit for the
car. Nice ride, huh?

03:05.085 --> 03:06.502
Yeah, whatever.

03:06.587 --> 03:10.715
By the way, these directions
suck. This project sucks.

03:10.799 --> 03:12.425
Hey, it's a great
opportunity.

03:12.509 --> 03:14.260
It's a reality show pilot!

03:14.344 --> 03:17.263
Hey, you sang your way to the top
seven the last time you were on TV.

03:17.347 --> 03:18.848
Now, you're the star.

03:18.932 --> 03:20.600
You're
Kimberly-fucking-Caldwell.

03:20.684 --> 03:22.393
You're the only celebrity
they've got!

03:22.478 --> 03:25.646
If I'm such a celebrity,
Tommy, get me a movie.

03:25.731 --> 03:28.149
Look, Kimster, your Q
score is going to go way up

03:28.233 --> 03:30.526
and you'll have a chance
to win 90 grand.

03:30.611 --> 03:31.694
I thought it was 100.

03:31.779 --> 03:34.030
Well, I get 10%,
remember?

03:36.784 --> 03:38.034
Wait. There's a turn off.

03:43.540 --> 03:47.752
Look, I've got power yoga in, like,
two hours. Did you find it yet?

03:48.212 --> 03:50.046
I don't know. There's
some old paper mill here,

03:50.130 --> 03:51.589
but there's nothing
about it on the map.

03:51.673 --> 03:52.924
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that's got to be it.

03:53.008 --> 03:55.176
Look, Kimbo, you can't afford
to make a wrong turn here.

03:55.260 --> 03:57.595
You really don't
have the time.

04:12.569 --> 04:13.569
Why am I here?

04:13.654 --> 04:15.279
Because this business
is tough. Besides...

04:15.364 --> 04:16.488
Wait, you're breaking up.
Hello?

04:16.572 --> 04:18.991
...of all my clients, you're the
one with the "it" factor here...

04:19.159 --> 04:21.577
Hello? Fuck!

04:45.352 --> 04:49.230
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

04:57.447 --> 04:59.615
Don't be dead.
Don't be dead.

05:20.053 --> 05:23.514
Help!

05:27.144 --> 05:28.269
Shit!

05:29.146 --> 05:30.438
Anybody?

05:35.819 --> 05:38.738
Don't worry. I'm going
to get you help. Okay?

05:40.240 --> 05:41.908
No. Please!

05:41.992 --> 05:45.828
Please! No, don't die.
Come on. Breathe! Breathe!

05:58.634 --> 06:00.343
I'm here. I'm here.

07:27.764 --> 07:31.058
It's the end of the
world. Society in chaos.

07:31.768 --> 07:34.270
Governments no longer
in control.

07:34.730 --> 07:38.524
The world has been devastated
by a catastrophic disaster

07:38.608 --> 07:40.276
but you're still alive.

07:42.696 --> 07:46.032
Overnight you've been thrust
back into the Stone Age.

07:46.116 --> 07:48.743
Modern conveniences
are a thing of the past.

07:48.827 --> 07:51.162
Would you have the guts
to survive?

07:51.246 --> 07:54.081
I am retired
Marine Colonel Dale Murphy.

07:54.166 --> 07:56.083
Welcome to the apocalypse.

07:56.168 --> 07:57.710
Over the next five days,

07:57.794 --> 08:01.756
these six contestants will
be put to the ultimate test.

08:02.049 --> 08:04.884
I'm going to be the ultimate
survivor, because on my last show

08:04.968 --> 08:08.512
I learned, more than
anything, what it takes to win.

08:08.597 --> 08:10.264
So what's
the tattoo?

08:10.348 --> 08:14.310
It's the infinity sign. Because
I want to be remembered forever.

08:15.353 --> 08:17.354
My friends
call me Jonesy

08:18.148 --> 08:20.483
but Fearless
is my middle name.

08:23.737 --> 08:26.906
No, that sucked, dude. I
told you to shave that run!

08:26.990 --> 08:28.824
Can we do that again?

08:29.451 --> 08:32.828
Hi, I'm Elena.
I'm like a fox.

08:32.913 --> 08:36.749
Sexy, sleek and I always
get what I want.

08:37.958 --> 08:42.755
Nina. I'm a survivor because I know
there's only one person I can count on,

08:42.839 --> 08:44.048
myself.

08:45.342 --> 08:46.425
I'm Jake.

08:46.510 --> 08:47.885
Three surgeries
on my rotator cuff

08:47.969 --> 08:50.346
destroyed my shot
at a pro football career

08:50.430 --> 08:52.056
but not my drive to win.

08:54.142 --> 08:56.435
Amber. One tour
of duty in Iraq.

08:56.520 --> 08:57.937
They call me
La Conquistadora.

08:59.439 --> 09:01.690
Enough said.
Semper Fi!

09:02.067 --> 09:06.028
These six contestants have been thrown
together in a devastated wasteland

09:06.113 --> 09:09.949
with only the clothes on their
backs and the will to survive.

09:10.033 --> 09:14.662
Rain or shine, in five
days, only one will remain.

09:14.746 --> 09:17.123
Welcome to the apocalypse.

09:27.217 --> 09:31.428
Well, what do you think, man? We
spent all last night cutting it.

09:31.513 --> 09:34.265
Brando,
eat your heart out.

09:34.349 --> 09:37.393
You're the real deal, yo.
That's why the network loves you.

09:37.477 --> 09:38.853
It rocks, M.

09:39.229 --> 09:42.231
Damn straight. We're
going to series for sure.

09:46.987 --> 09:49.989
Today's a good day to die.
Where's my producer?

09:50.115 --> 09:53.409
It's brilliant, Michael.
Really. Mara? Thank you.

09:56.413 --> 09:58.455
You know, I still don't
see what makes this show

09:58.540 --> 10:00.374
any different from that
other survivor show.

10:00.458 --> 10:01.834
I don't watch television.

10:01.918 --> 10:04.003
It's supposed to take place
at the end of the world, man.

10:04.087 --> 10:05.421
That's what
makes it different.

10:05.505 --> 10:08.174
Look, you're not on some summer
resort trying to make alliances,

10:08.258 --> 10:10.885
you're trying to be the last man
standing after the apocalypse.

10:10.969 --> 10:14.138
It's killer, middle-America
family entertainment, mate.

10:14.222 --> 10:15.806
Boo-ya.

10:16.683 --> 10:17.975
I'm so there, dude.

10:18.059 --> 10:19.185
No.

10:19.269 --> 10:21.353
I plan on being
the last woman standing.

10:21.438 --> 10:24.648
Chill, Ramba. The prize
money's going to be mine.

10:25.025 --> 10:28.068
You two girls could mud
wrestle for it. Be ratings gold.

10:29.362 --> 10:30.571
You stupid man.

10:30.655 --> 10:32.031
I am tapping that.

10:32.115 --> 10:34.366
Hey, it's the
parrot heads.

10:34.451 --> 10:36.035
Nice shirts, boys.

10:36.119 --> 10:37.953
Yeah, make fun
all you want,

10:38.038 --> 10:40.831
but while you Hollywood freaks
are out here sleeping on rocks

10:40.916 --> 10:44.627
us parrot heads will be in
Margaritaville back at the hotel.

10:45.670 --> 10:49.381
The woods are all wired up, 32
cameras and mikes ready to go.

10:49.466 --> 10:51.050
Oh, you the man, Wojo.

10:51.134 --> 10:54.595
Listen, just make sure everything's
copasetic with Neil, okay?

10:54.679 --> 10:55.971
Yeah, see you
in five days.

10:56.056 --> 10:58.307
Enjoy the great outdoors,
Tarantino.

10:58.391 --> 10:59.475
Nice.

11:01.144 --> 11:04.563
I could help you spread it on
all those hard-to-reach places.

11:04.648 --> 11:08.150
You know, if I hadn't seen you
eat shit at the X Games last June,

11:08.235 --> 11:09.985
maybe you'd
stand a chance.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.987
Hey, I made the
street comp finals.

11:12.072 --> 11:13.864
Okay, here's a clue.

11:14.074 --> 11:17.284
I only give it up to
winners, not guys who choke.

11:18.828 --> 11:21.372
I'll give you something
to choke on.

11:30.006 --> 11:32.091
I wish I had abs
like yours.

11:32.175 --> 11:34.343
I do 200 of these a day.

11:35.428 --> 11:39.265
I guess I'll just stick to my
low-carb diet and hope for the best.

11:39.349 --> 11:40.808
Mara, where the hell
is Kimberly?

11:40.892 --> 11:42.226
There's still no answer.

11:42.310 --> 11:45.479
God damn it! I knew that prima
donna was a problem when we cast her.

11:45.563 --> 11:47.690
Yeah, but she's got those
Angelina Jolie lips.

11:47.774 --> 11:50.192
You know what I'm
talking about, don't you?

11:50.277 --> 11:52.069
It's gonna be
a long five days.

11:52.153 --> 11:55.030
All right. We can't wait any
longer. I gotta shoot, like, now.

11:55.865 --> 11:57.324
You're the producer,
Pop-Tart.

11:57.409 --> 12:00.494
It's why you make the big
bucks. What are we going to do?

12:00.578 --> 12:01.745
Well, we can't recast.

12:01.830 --> 12:03.122
So we're just going to
have to go with five.

12:03.206 --> 12:04.290
Whoa, whoa. No. Wrong.

12:04.374 --> 12:05.332
You know the show.

12:05.417 --> 12:07.459
All I have to do is shoot your
character intro and we're good to go.

12:07.544 --> 12:08.669
No, I don't think so.

12:08.753 --> 12:11.046
What other choice
do we have?

12:13.300 --> 12:14.425
Um...

12:15.385 --> 12:16.844
Okay. Yeah.
What the hell?

12:16.928 --> 12:19.471
That's it. Show them
what you're made of.

12:19.556 --> 12:21.557
All right, boys and girls,
listen up.

12:21.641 --> 12:23.976
We have a half-mile hike
to the survivalist camp.

12:24.060 --> 12:25.894
Let's go!
It's time to move out!

12:25.979 --> 12:28.397
All right. Everybody grab
your gear and let's get going.

12:28.481 --> 12:29.523
This is it.

12:29.607 --> 12:31.025
Hey, Michael.

12:32.193 --> 12:34.903
You know I'm a complete geek
without my BlackBerry and my cell.

12:34.988 --> 12:37.406
I mean, there's a good chance
I'll be the first to go.

12:37.490 --> 12:41.327
Oh, come on. Just change your
clothes, put on some bug spray.

12:41.411 --> 12:44.455
You'll be great, even
without your CrackBerry.

12:45.707 --> 12:48.250
Okay. I'll do it for you.

12:48.585 --> 12:54.006
Okay, but, Mara, it's
"M" now, not Michael.

12:54.090 --> 12:56.550
Yes. I know.
Okay. Sorry.

12:56.634 --> 12:57.760
Bye.

13:11.649 --> 13:13.609
God. Who am I kidding?

13:15.445 --> 13:17.321
Okay,
we're moving out.

13:17.405 --> 13:21.533
You're all alone out here, so let's
close ranks and stick together.

13:28.833 --> 13:30.000
Hey, everyone's leaving.

13:31.378 --> 13:34.463
Hello? Hey.
Everyone's leaving.

13:34.631 --> 13:35.714
What?

13:35.799 --> 13:38.050
We're about to start the
game. It's time to go.

13:38.134 --> 13:39.968
Hi, I'm Jake.
You're Nina, right?

13:40.053 --> 13:42.471
Look, I'm just here
for the money,

13:42.555 --> 13:44.139
not to make friends,
okay?

13:44.599 --> 13:46.642
Wow. Okay.
Fair enough.

13:48.061 --> 13:50.521
Oh, Nina. Nina.

13:52.232 --> 13:54.691
I saw you drop this while you
were getting out of the RV.

13:54.776 --> 13:56.402
Now M said no food.

13:56.528 --> 13:58.987
Oh, well, I'm vegan.

14:00.156 --> 14:01.949
That might be the only
thing I can eat out here.

14:02.033 --> 14:04.159
Well, you can always
go chew on a tree.

14:04.244 --> 14:06.495
This is cheating.

14:08.415 --> 14:10.416
Sue me. Give it back.
Ah-ah!

14:11.042 --> 14:14.962
I would have, but since there's
no need to be making friends...

14:18.258 --> 14:19.383
Mmm.

14:21.136 --> 14:22.136
That's good.

14:27.100 --> 14:28.559
All right, everybody.
Ready?

14:28.643 --> 14:30.686
And action, Dale!

14:31.438 --> 14:34.064
You cannot survive
the apocalypse alone,

14:34.149 --> 14:37.609
so you make friendships,
perform tasks together.

14:37.694 --> 14:40.946
You figure out who you
need to ride out the chaos

14:41.030 --> 14:42.573
and who's expendable.

14:43.199 --> 14:45.492
Today we're going to split
into three teams,

14:45.577 --> 14:47.578
go out and search for food.

14:47.662 --> 14:50.998
The number each of you
picked decides your teammate.

14:52.542 --> 14:54.751
Number one
all the way, baby.

14:55.920 --> 14:58.046
You and me, baby,
all the way.

14:59.299 --> 15:00.632
Who's got a number two?

15:00.717 --> 15:02.968
Well, I did a number two
back at the gas station.

15:04.471 --> 15:06.555
Come on, dude.
That was funny.

15:09.976 --> 15:12.227
Oh, sweet.

15:12.729 --> 15:15.522
I guess you and me
are a team. Hello?

15:15.607 --> 15:16.732
All right,
boys and girls.

15:16.816 --> 15:20.152
It's the end of the world and the
odds are against you from the start.

15:20.487 --> 15:23.280
Radiation poisoning
is a reality.

15:23.364 --> 15:25.324
That's why you're all
wearing these.

15:25.408 --> 15:28.994
Every day you will be given
a Radiation Elimination Card

15:29.287 --> 15:31.205
and one of them
is already contaminated.

15:32.415 --> 15:33.790
At the end of the day,

15:33.875 --> 15:37.836
the player holding the
simulated radiated card is dead.

15:37.921 --> 15:41.381
Don't worry, it just
means you're disqualified.

15:41.466 --> 15:43.592
But you have a chance
to survive the day

15:43.676 --> 15:46.261
by giving your card
to another player

15:46.346 --> 15:49.431
and surviving
the Radiation Elimination.

15:49.933 --> 15:55.020
It's a test of your personal
will, your endurance and fate.

15:55.104 --> 15:56.813
And in the apocalypse,

15:56.940 --> 16:00.108
your fate can change
like that.

16:00.443 --> 16:03.278
Wild animals,
bacterial infection,

16:03.613 --> 16:06.657
and post-apocalyptic crazies
are all around you

16:07.116 --> 16:10.744
waiting to take you down.
They're represented

16:12.121 --> 16:13.747
by these.

16:13.831 --> 16:18.252
We call them Twists of Fate.
They are survival challenges

16:18.336 --> 16:22.297
and dozens of them are scattered
all over the playing area.

16:22.382 --> 16:25.551
You trigger the motion
sensor and you hear this...

16:30.974 --> 16:34.851
Instructions on the back
explain your survival challenge.

16:34.936 --> 16:37.187
Accomplish the challenge

16:37.272 --> 16:40.399
and you earn the right
to take your radiated card

16:40.483 --> 16:44.945
and give it to any player you choose
and automatically survive the day.

16:48.241 --> 16:51.827
We are going to assemble
back here at 1800 hours

16:51.911 --> 16:58.083
and see who will perish in the chaos
and who is one step closer to $100,000.

16:58.167 --> 17:00.168
Good luck to all of you.

17:00.253 --> 17:03.338
Remember, you have
to work as a team

17:03.423 --> 17:05.757
to survive the game.

17:05.842 --> 17:08.510
But only one of you can
be the Ultimate Survivalist

17:08.595 --> 17:10.846
after the apocalypse!

17:11.638 --> 17:12.681
Cut!

17:12.765 --> 17:14.098
Nice work, Dale.

17:14.183 --> 17:16.727
All right! I'm ready for
my 15 minutes, Hollywood.

17:19.021 --> 17:20.271
Okay, everybody.

17:22.233 --> 17:25.902
The headsets are transmitting audio
and video back to the edit bay.

17:25.987 --> 17:27.404
So don't take them off.

17:27.488 --> 17:31.033
And also, cell phones, PDAs,
etc., give them to Neil.

17:31.117 --> 17:33.577
He's going to put them
in the RV.

17:38.207 --> 17:40.584
Have fun. I've got to go
take a wicked piss, mate.

17:40.668 --> 17:41.752
Mmm-hmm.

17:41.836 --> 17:45.005
Okay, I'm going to follow Elena
and Jake first, as planned.

17:45.089 --> 17:48.300
Just remember, everybody,
let's make it feel real.

17:48.635 --> 17:50.135
Okay.

17:52.096 --> 17:53.180
Hey, what's up?

17:53.264 --> 17:57.184
I'm so gonna suck at this.
Why'd I let you talk me into it?

17:57.894 --> 17:59.936
Because I'm irresistible?

18:01.397 --> 18:02.981
You're a jerk, you know.

18:03.066 --> 18:04.399
Come on.

18:06.277 --> 18:09.780
Colonel, what happens if we
lose the elimination round?

18:09.864 --> 18:12.491
We go back to the RV
and you drown your sorrows

18:12.575 --> 18:14.826
with me and Jack Daniels
until the game is done.

18:14.911 --> 18:18.163
Well, that sounds like fun, but don't
worry, sweetness. I won't let you lose.

18:18.247 --> 18:21.416
And if any of those pig-fucking
hillbillies come around, I got your back.

18:21.501 --> 18:22.793
Hey, bonehead!

18:22.877 --> 18:24.336
I grew up two counties
from here.

18:24.420 --> 18:26.338
I never had sex
with a pig in my life!

18:26.422 --> 18:29.174
You're not promoting
stereotypes, are you, son?

18:29.258 --> 18:30.509
Outstanding!

18:30.593 --> 18:33.011
People in these parts might
not take that talk too well.

18:33.096 --> 18:34.304
You might want to
put a lid on it.

18:34.389 --> 18:36.473
Is that all right with you,
funny man?

18:36.557 --> 18:37.808
Yes, sir.

18:43.523 --> 18:44.815
That's cool.

18:44.899 --> 18:47.484
You guys got the whole
military bond thing happening.

18:47.568 --> 18:48.610
Semper Fi and shit.

18:48.695 --> 18:51.071
Yeah, and we both
hate assholes.

18:56.661 --> 19:01.415
Shit! The techies were supposed to
finish setting these up before they left.

19:01.499 --> 19:03.542
Put your producer hat away
and get your head in the game.

19:03.626 --> 19:06.294
I'll set these up. I've
got time to kill anyway.

19:06.379 --> 19:09.297
Thank you. God, I wish
I didn't have to do this.

19:09.382 --> 19:11.758
Old Mikey really put you
on the spot, didn't he?

19:11.843 --> 19:16.054
Guess he thinks it'll be entertaining
to send a city girl into the woods.

19:16.139 --> 19:18.181
Cruel if you ask me.
But don't worry.

19:18.266 --> 19:20.559
There's something in you
he doesn't see that I do.

19:20.643 --> 19:23.895
You may be pretty, but
you're tougher than you think.

19:23.980 --> 19:25.147
You'll be all right.

19:29.652 --> 19:31.987
So, Nina,
which way should we...

19:32.071 --> 19:33.989
I guess we go that way.

20:40.473 --> 20:43.475
If you eat fish, maybe we should head
towards the river to find some food.

20:43.559 --> 20:46.520
I'm vegan. I don't eat or
use any animal products,

20:46.604 --> 20:48.814
including
the swimming kind.

20:49.106 --> 20:50.232
Oh.

20:50.900 --> 20:52.567
Isn't your belt
made of leather?

20:52.652 --> 20:55.362
It's pleather.
I'm not a hypocrite.

20:55.738 --> 20:57.948
No, I didn't think
that you were.

20:58.032 --> 21:01.076
Actually, being vegan is why
you got picked to be on the show.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.703
M thought that there wouldn't
be a lot for you to eat out here

21:03.788 --> 21:05.705
and you might have to
resort to gulping down

21:05.873 --> 21:08.166
insect larva or something.

21:09.043 --> 21:12.170
It's the kind of thing America
loves in its reality shows, right?

21:12.255 --> 21:13.797
America's sick.

21:14.340 --> 21:15.423
Yeah.

21:16.384 --> 21:20.178
I hate reality shows.
They're pretty idiotic.

21:20.763 --> 21:22.722
Then why are you
doing this?

21:22.807 --> 21:24.057
Because it's my job.

21:24.684 --> 21:27.894
It's M's first project and I'm
just trying to be supportive.

21:27.979 --> 21:29.354
If I was
his girlfriend,

21:29.438 --> 21:31.690
I would've said, "This
sucks. You're on your own. "

21:31.774 --> 21:32.983
Come on.
No, you wouldn't.

21:33.067 --> 21:37.112
Yeah, I would. If you haven't
noticed, I can be a bit of a bitch.

21:38.906 --> 21:42.742
Well, if you hate reality shows,
then why are you doing this?

21:43.619 --> 21:45.287
Let's just keep going.

21:45.371 --> 21:47.205
We've got to
find some food.

22:33.044 --> 22:34.586
Fucking weekend warriors.

22:56.359 --> 22:59.903
You better stand down or
someone's going to get hurt.

23:46.075 --> 23:49.786
Broken arrow, that's really
going to help us hunt for food.

23:54.417 --> 23:58.086
Spear. I like it.
It's so long and hard.

23:59.630 --> 24:00.839
I'm just goofing.

24:00.923 --> 24:04.342
Come on. I read your
bio back in the RV.

24:04.427 --> 24:07.846
West Point, 4.0 average.
You're brainy. That's tight.

24:08.931 --> 24:10.515
I bet you're a reader.

24:10.599 --> 24:12.517
What's your
favorite book, huh?

24:13.686 --> 24:16.104
I'm in The Cat in the Hat
myself.

24:16.689 --> 24:19.107
So you did the whole tour of duty
in Iraq thing, too. That's cool.

24:19.191 --> 24:20.567
I'm more of
a pacifist myself,

24:20.651 --> 24:22.569
but, hey, I can get down
with the patriotism.

24:22.653 --> 24:23.945
Woman in uniform
is a turn-on.

24:24.030 --> 24:25.613
Will you shut up?
Oh, she talks.

24:29.368 --> 24:31.661
We've been hiking
for three hours,

24:31.746 --> 24:33.997
but we haven't seen or
heard any animals or birds.

24:35.207 --> 24:36.875
It's dead quiet
out here.

24:36.959 --> 24:39.878
It's freaky, right?
It's like we're all alone.

24:39.962 --> 24:43.423
We could get all nasty and nobody'd see
a thing, except for 30 million people.

24:43.507 --> 24:45.633
Come on, you're into me,
like, a little bit.

24:47.344 --> 24:49.304
You just don't get it,
do you?

24:49.388 --> 24:50.889
I'm not into men.

24:52.141 --> 24:55.977
You... You're a lesbian?
How hot is that?

24:58.939 --> 25:03.109
All right, let me just get
focused here, and action.

25:03.819 --> 25:07.447
So I'm at the two, I'm at the
one, I jump, I leap, bam...

25:08.866 --> 25:11.034
Shoulder was
never the same.

25:12.119 --> 25:15.163
Killed my chances at a
pro career just like that.

25:16.957 --> 25:21.169
It's funny because you never know
when your life's going to change.

25:22.338 --> 25:26.841
Man, I wanted to be in the
NFL so bad. Since I was six.

25:27.301 --> 25:30.637
Oh, honey, I totally understand
where you're coming from.

25:30.721 --> 25:33.014
No, dude, don't.
Don't look.

25:33.099 --> 25:34.933
Don't look in the lens.

25:35.017 --> 25:38.144
So then after college
you just bounced around

25:38.229 --> 25:40.396
trying to find yourself?

25:40.481 --> 25:42.774
Yeah, well, this opportunity
came up, you know,

25:42.858 --> 25:44.442
to be on this TV show.

25:44.527 --> 25:46.653
I can't throw a football no
more, but I'm still athletic.

25:46.737 --> 25:47.987
Mmm-hmm.

25:48.364 --> 25:51.950
I figure I'd use the talents
that God gave me, right?

25:52.034 --> 25:54.536
Well, we'll have
to thank God later.

25:55.204 --> 25:56.538
Yeah, right,
thank God later.

25:56.622 --> 25:59.874
You know, I think I hear
the river this way. Yeah.

26:00.709 --> 26:01.960
Come on.

26:06.590 --> 26:08.716
God didn't give you
a pair of balls?

26:12.221 --> 26:14.305
How about
we take a break?

26:14.682 --> 26:18.184
We have to find food. If we
prove that we're the best at it,

26:18.269 --> 26:22.564
then it's less likely that anybody
will give us their radiation card.

26:23.232 --> 26:25.567
I haven't seen
anything to eat.

26:26.944 --> 26:28.403
Oh, no.
Holy shit!

26:28.487 --> 26:31.156
It's one of those Twists
of Fates. I set it off.

26:31.907 --> 26:33.408
Where is it?

26:35.661 --> 26:39.164
"You've been infected by anthrax
from a nearby laboratory explosion.

26:39.248 --> 26:42.500
"An antidote can be found by the
river. You have two minutes. "

26:42.585 --> 26:43.668
God, I would get this!

26:43.752 --> 26:46.462
Yeah, well, good luck. Go!

26:46.547 --> 26:49.340
Hey, come and shoot.
We need your footage.

27:02.062 --> 27:03.688
I think
I see the river.

27:03.772 --> 27:04.981
Where?

27:14.366 --> 27:16.326
What do you need now?

27:16.410 --> 27:17.410
That!

27:17.494 --> 27:18.870
One minute remaining.

27:30.883 --> 27:32.884
45 seconds remaining.

27:44.146 --> 27:45.563
30 seconds remaining.

28:06.835 --> 28:08.711
Eight, seven,

28:08.796 --> 28:11.381
six, five,

28:11.465 --> 28:14.467
four, three, two.

28:17.680 --> 28:19.305
Got it!

28:20.766 --> 28:22.892
I can't believe I did it!

28:22.977 --> 28:24.269
You kicked ass!

28:30.859 --> 28:32.110
Awesome.

28:35.114 --> 28:38.157
All right, guys, one sec.
Okay. Keep it loose.

28:39.368 --> 28:40.868
You ready?

28:40.953 --> 28:42.036
Go.

28:43.038 --> 28:45.540
Whew, it is hot out here.

28:46.542 --> 28:49.419
You know what?
I think we can fish later.

28:51.171 --> 28:52.714
We are rolling.

28:58.971 --> 29:01.806
I think I need
to cool off.

29:11.608 --> 29:12.900
So,

29:13.986 --> 29:16.863
do you want to get wet?

29:20.993 --> 29:22.410
What are you doing?

29:23.579 --> 29:26.164
M, what the fuck? I am
standing here giving it my all

29:26.248 --> 29:28.666
and this jock is
just standing there.

29:28.751 --> 29:30.168
Cut!

29:30.252 --> 29:32.378
Okay, what's going on, man?

29:33.589 --> 29:36.799
Look, man, I want to create
chemistry between you two, okay?

29:36.884 --> 29:38.426
You guys are, like,
the sex of this thing.

29:38.510 --> 29:39.510
Mmm-hmm.

29:39.595 --> 29:42.430
You said you wanted
a family reality show.

29:42.514 --> 29:44.640
Well, sex is America's
dirty little secret.

29:44.725 --> 29:47.769
You can't talk about it at
church, but at home on TV,

29:47.853 --> 29:50.355
people want to see hard bodies,
wet and glistening in the sun.

29:50.439 --> 29:51.522
Look, if I do that,

29:51.607 --> 29:54.192
I have a mother and six nieces
that would never speak to me again.

29:54.276 --> 29:57.111
Look, man, people want
to be entertained.

29:57.821 --> 30:00.198
Elena and I are just
greasing the wheels a little.

30:00.282 --> 30:01.616
Greasing the wheels?
Yeah.

30:01.700 --> 30:04.243
Well, look, man, I'm here
to play the game, okay?

30:04.328 --> 30:06.496
Now, you can go
grease the wheels.

30:06.580 --> 30:08.539
You can try
catching some fish.

30:08.624 --> 30:11.376
I'll see if I can find
something to eat in the woods.

30:11.460 --> 30:15.254
Grease the wheels. You two are
warped. I'll catch you all later.

30:16.715 --> 30:20.718
"Catch you all later"! Great. I
wanted Diddy, I've got a boy scout.

30:24.223 --> 30:25.681
M, wait.

30:25.766 --> 30:29.268
We don't need Jake. I'm
all the sex that you want.

30:30.729 --> 30:33.314
You're hot, but it's not the same thing.

30:33.690 --> 30:34.732
Hey! Where you going?

30:34.817 --> 30:37.652
What, you're gonna go
shoot your girlfriend?

30:38.612 --> 30:42.073
No. Actually, I've got to
rethink the story lines.

30:42.491 --> 30:46.035
Hey, listen, I'm doing
this gig for, like, free,

30:47.621 --> 30:51.040
and I want all the screen
time that I can get.

30:51.750 --> 30:54.502
And I know how to
make sure that happens.

30:56.922 --> 30:58.172
Really?

31:02.052 --> 31:03.511
Works for me.

31:16.525 --> 31:17.775
No, you don't get it.

31:17.860 --> 31:21.946
I'm like a complete spaz when it comes
to anything even remotely athletic.

31:22.030 --> 31:23.990
I'm sorry I didn't help.

31:24.658 --> 31:27.243
You're just playing
the game. I understand.

31:27.327 --> 31:29.454
I just really
need this money.

31:29.538 --> 31:31.706
Look, I'm not going to
give you my radiation card,

31:31.790 --> 31:33.958
if that's what
you're worried about.

31:34.042 --> 31:37.712
I'm just thrilled that I
actually get to live another day!

31:48.015 --> 31:49.348
Motherfucker.

32:03.614 --> 32:05.781
Look, I know it hurts

32:05.866 --> 32:08.659
but you don't need a piece of
shit like that in your life.

32:08.744 --> 32:09.744
You're better off
without him.

32:14.875 --> 32:17.126
I thought he was
"the one," you know?

32:17.211 --> 32:18.294
Yeah.

32:22.466 --> 32:25.301
I've known scumbags
like this all my life.

32:26.053 --> 32:27.845
Six months ago,

32:27.930 --> 32:31.057
I caught my fiancé in bed
with my best friend.

32:31.391 --> 32:32.433
Really?

32:32.518 --> 32:37.772
To top it off, he used my credit
cards to put me into major debt.

32:38.565 --> 32:41.150
That's why I have
to win this game.

32:41.235 --> 32:44.779
The sooner you realize you
can only depend on yourself,

32:45.948 --> 32:47.949
the better off
you'll be.

32:50.077 --> 32:51.452
Come on.

32:52.120 --> 32:55.289
Take a breath. Let's go
down there and kick his ass.

32:58.293 --> 33:00.461
Is that what you did
to your fiancé?

33:00.546 --> 33:02.713
Put him in the hospital.
Come on.

33:04.466 --> 33:08.094
No. I'll just deal
with it my own way.

33:08.178 --> 33:09.762
It's what he deserves!

33:11.473 --> 33:12.890
It's not me.

33:13.642 --> 33:14.767
Come on.

33:14.851 --> 33:18.646
No! I'm not like you.
I don't want to be.

33:20.816 --> 33:22.650
I'm sorry.
That came out wrong.

33:23.527 --> 33:24.860
It's okay.

33:34.329 --> 33:36.080
Come on. Just tell me one
hot experience that you had.

33:36.164 --> 33:37.206
Oh, God.

33:37.291 --> 33:39.083
No, I can even get you on
Howard Stern if it's good.

33:39.167 --> 33:40.835
I've got a buddy who works
in his studio in New York.

33:40.919 --> 33:42.128
You're such a moron.

33:42.212 --> 33:44.463
Yeah, but we're on the
same team here, you know?

33:44.548 --> 33:46.215
The same team.

33:46.300 --> 33:49.260
All right. All right. All right.
All right. I'll stop. I'll stop.

33:49.344 --> 33:50.845
I swear.
Cross my heart.

33:51.388 --> 33:52.430
No more sex talk.

33:52.514 --> 33:55.099
From now on, you'll be the
uptight lesbian sister I never had.

33:55.183 --> 33:56.517
Truce?

34:00.188 --> 34:01.606
Oh!

34:02.482 --> 34:04.775
And now that we're family tell
me, who went down on who first?

34:06.069 --> 34:08.279
I'm kidding.
I'm just...

34:11.033 --> 34:12.366
Is that barbecue?

34:15.536 --> 34:17.705
Mission fucking
accomplished.

34:17.789 --> 34:20.041
Wait. This is too easy.

34:20.125 --> 34:22.126
Maybe this is a trap
to make us lose the game.

34:22.210 --> 34:24.003
What trap? It's a hunter's camp, sister.

34:24.087 --> 34:25.129
What are you doing?

34:25.213 --> 34:27.172
I'm starved, and damn,
that smells awesome.

34:27.257 --> 34:29.800
Well, if this is a real hunter's
camp, we can't just steal his food.

34:29.885 --> 34:30.885
Why the hell not?

34:30.969 --> 34:33.638
It's a survival-of-the-fittest kind
of thing, you know. Finders keepers.

34:33.722 --> 34:35.973
You're a lesbian.
Where are your cojones?

34:36.058 --> 34:38.141
Look, if we bring this back
to share with the others,

34:38.226 --> 34:40.561
nobody's going to want us
out of the game, huh?

34:42.522 --> 34:43.981
What, it's hot?

34:54.242 --> 34:55.493
Finally, we're a team.

34:57.245 --> 34:58.579
Don't push your luck.

35:00.666 --> 35:04.585
Mmm. Pork. Man, these hillbillies
really know their barbecue.

36:17.492 --> 36:18.659
So what are you
going to do?

36:18.744 --> 36:22.621
Getting out of here. I'll call the
techies to drive me back to Wheeling.

36:22.706 --> 36:24.498
Well, you're headed
the wrong way.

36:24.583 --> 36:26.250
RV and cell phones
are back that way.

36:26.334 --> 36:28.377
Yeah, I can't get
a signal from the RV.

36:28.462 --> 36:30.129
I'm just going to
call them from there.

36:31.131 --> 36:32.173
Okay.

36:33.925 --> 36:37.887
Besides, I really don't want to
run into Michael at the trailer.

36:38.346 --> 36:40.765
You're kidding.
No, you're crazy. Okay.

36:40.849 --> 36:42.016
Hello?

36:47.647 --> 36:48.814
Hello?

36:51.777 --> 36:54.528
You can't just walk
into somebody's house.

36:55.113 --> 36:59.116
Hello? I need to use
your phone, please.

37:03.663 --> 37:05.748
We shouldn't be here.

37:05.832 --> 37:07.792
Then just wait
for me outside.

37:07.876 --> 37:11.003
I want to make one
phone call and I'm gone.

37:13.340 --> 37:14.507
Hello?

37:40.075 --> 37:41.158
Oh.

37:43.203 --> 37:44.912
All right.
No phone, so...

37:45.872 --> 37:47.832
Oh! Uh...

37:47.916 --> 37:49.375
We done yet?

37:54.214 --> 37:55.548
Holy shit!

37:59.135 --> 38:00.970
The whole family's deformed.

38:02.597 --> 38:04.265
God, look at the twins.

38:10.814 --> 38:12.857
It'll be all right.
Don't worry...

38:12.941 --> 38:15.109
Hold on.
Don't drop her.

38:24.995 --> 38:27.454
Baby's coming now. You
stay here with your ma.

38:27.539 --> 38:29.164
I'm gonna fetch
some water.

39:18.173 --> 39:19.548
The toolbox!

39:26.139 --> 39:27.348
Go, go!

39:32.020 --> 39:33.729
What do we do now?

39:34.272 --> 39:35.481
Help me!

39:52.374 --> 39:54.333
There's light.
There's light.

41:20.795 --> 41:23.130
Help me.

43:05.233 --> 43:06.358
Fuck her.

43:43.313 --> 43:44.438
Hey, you good?

43:44.522 --> 43:45.606
I'm good.

43:47.525 --> 43:50.319
Can we keep this
as our secret?

43:50.403 --> 43:51.695
I wouldn't want to
mess things up with Mara.

43:51.779 --> 43:54.323
You know, I think she's "the one," so...

43:54.407 --> 43:55.741
Whatever.

43:56.367 --> 43:58.118
All right. I'm heading
back to the RV. You coming?

43:59.162 --> 44:02.706
No, my job is done. I'm just
going to stay here and tan.

44:07.003 --> 44:08.921
Tell Mara I say hi.

44:13.343 --> 44:14.551
You're the star.

44:14.636 --> 44:15.844
Uh-huh!

44:38.743 --> 44:41.370
M? Is that you?

44:43.164 --> 44:44.957
Don't screw around.
It's not cool.

44:59.764 --> 45:03.517
Oh, shit! Okay,
what's the challenge?

45:10.149 --> 45:11.316
Fuck.

46:52.627 --> 46:53.710
Mara.

46:54.754 --> 46:55.962
Mara!

48:57.752 --> 48:59.377
Hey, Neil! I'm back, yo.

48:59.462 --> 49:01.922
What, are you
dropping a deuce?

49:02.215 --> 49:04.508
Seriously, Neil,
light a match.

49:05.301 --> 49:06.510
Neil!

49:07.762 --> 49:09.679
Guess you're not here.

49:09.764 --> 49:12.224
All right,
let's see what we can see.

49:16.896 --> 49:18.939
Run, no, run.

49:24.403 --> 49:25.487
What?

49:28.115 --> 49:29.449
What the...

49:30.535 --> 49:31.910
Oh, fuck.

49:33.996 --> 49:35.455
Let's see.

49:35.665 --> 49:36.998
This end...

49:38.167 --> 49:40.085
This end, too. All right.

49:40.169 --> 49:42.712
Well, this works. Well,
then, what's the matter?

49:42.797 --> 49:46.424
Neil, I can't figure.
This seems...

49:46.509 --> 49:49.719
Great, you know. You spend
money on film school, just to...

49:52.139 --> 49:53.473
Looks fine.

49:56.811 --> 49:58.478
Two, three, four...

49:58.563 --> 50:02.148
Input. Output. Yeah,
that works. Looks good.

50:02.525 --> 50:03.900
What is that? Nina?

50:18.332 --> 50:21.876
Damn it! Neil, you can't
move! We're hardwired in.

50:27.008 --> 50:28.383
What the...

51:15.556 --> 51:17.223
This is cool.

51:17.308 --> 51:19.309
Going for
another one, huh?

51:19.393 --> 51:20.852
The only white meat.

51:20.936 --> 51:22.812
If this is what Armageddon's
like, bring it on, baby.

51:22.897 --> 51:25.815
Yeah. Maybe next time you
should search for a bib.

51:25.900 --> 51:27.525
I'm so glad
I ran into you guys.

51:27.610 --> 51:29.694
Yeah, and don't forget
who got you the nosh, dude.

51:29.779 --> 51:31.571
You win the chance to get
rid of that nuclear card,

51:31.656 --> 51:32.697
send it someplace else.

51:32.782 --> 51:34.240
No worries.

51:36.494 --> 51:38.203
Hey, where's M and Elena?

51:38.913 --> 51:42.415
Back at the river shooting
the unrated version of the DVD.

51:42.500 --> 51:44.167
I'll see you two later.

51:44.251 --> 51:45.752
Oh, dude.

51:46.253 --> 51:47.379
I can't even move.

51:47.463 --> 51:49.381
I'm so stuffed, sex is
going to have to wait.

51:50.591 --> 51:52.133
Shit ghost!

51:53.052 --> 51:54.511
You're nasty.

51:54.595 --> 51:56.137
If you win, what will
you do with the money?

51:56.222 --> 51:59.849
When I win, I'm going to throw the
most outrageous beach party in history.

51:59.934 --> 52:01.643
You're a cliché, dude.

52:02.812 --> 52:03.853
How about you?

52:03.938 --> 52:05.772
Well, when I win,

52:05.856 --> 52:07.982
I plan on getting my
degree in sports medicine.

52:08.442 --> 52:10.819
Since my arm won't let me
play football anymore,

52:10.903 --> 52:13.571
I figure I can still help others,
you know, stay in the game.

52:13.656 --> 52:17.742
Can't be a football hero, so you'll
settle for a hero of any kind.

52:17.952 --> 52:20.036
Yeah, something like that.

52:20.621 --> 52:23.081
Nice to know there's
still hope for mankind.

52:23.165 --> 52:26.126
Dude, if you're saying this to
get in her pants, forget about it.

52:26.210 --> 52:28.002
She doesn't play
on our team.

52:28.087 --> 52:29.087
Shut up.

52:29.171 --> 52:32.507
How about you? What you
plan on doing with the cash?

52:33.259 --> 52:34.926
I owe my father
a bunch of money.

52:35.010 --> 52:38.012
If I win, I am free and
clear of him for good.

52:38.681 --> 52:40.014
Your father?

52:40.099 --> 52:42.392
He doesn't approve
of my lifestyle.

52:42.476 --> 52:44.060
Wants nothing
to do with me.

52:44.311 --> 52:45.353
Hmm.

52:46.188 --> 52:48.398
I guess you can't
choose family.

52:48.482 --> 52:50.817
Man, M is so screwed.

52:51.652 --> 52:55.113
He wanted a show for middle
America, but he hired a lesbo,

52:55.197 --> 52:57.615
a sensitive jock,
a bi-polar vegan,

52:57.700 --> 52:59.576
an extreme fuck-up
and Miss Hollywood.

52:59.660 --> 53:01.745
Dude, we're the red state
cast from hell.

53:04.081 --> 53:05.331
Oh, God.

53:06.709 --> 53:08.001
Yo, Nina.

53:09.503 --> 53:11.379
You all right, Nina?

53:11.464 --> 53:13.339
Mara... Dead.

53:13.632 --> 53:14.674
What happened to you?

53:14.759 --> 53:15.967
We have to
get out of here!

53:16.051 --> 53:17.177
Now!
What?

53:17.261 --> 53:18.344
They killed her!

53:18.429 --> 53:19.971
Hey, look. Calm down.
They'll find us here!

53:20.055 --> 53:21.431
Whoa, take a deep breath,
okay? Who?

53:21.515 --> 53:23.725
Who will find us here?
What are you talking about?

53:23.809 --> 53:27.937
These hillbilly freaks.
They killed Mara

53:28.022 --> 53:30.940
and they tied her to
the hood of their truck.

53:31.275 --> 53:33.526
We have to get out of here.
Right now!

53:37.031 --> 53:38.531
This is awesome!

53:38.616 --> 53:39.532
What is wrong with you?

53:39.617 --> 53:40.617
I'm not kidding!

53:40.701 --> 53:42.076
Come on.
It's part of the game.

53:42.161 --> 53:44.704
Post-apocalyptic crazies are
roaming through the forest?

53:44.789 --> 53:49.292
It's not a game, okay? These
hillbillies were eating her finger!

53:49.794 --> 53:52.128
Hillbilly cannibals.
M is a genius!

53:52.713 --> 53:53.755
Stop laughing!

53:53.839 --> 53:55.673
Yo, you, yo, stop laughing,
man, okay? Hold on.

53:55.758 --> 53:57.759
It's Mara.
She's M's girlfriend.

53:57.843 --> 53:59.761
She was in on it.
I got this.

53:59.845 --> 54:02.555
What you saw was
special effects.

54:04.809 --> 54:07.435
What I saw was real.

54:07.520 --> 54:09.604
We need to get
out of here. Now.

54:10.231 --> 54:12.732
Please. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're going.

54:12.817 --> 54:15.318
This is just a test
to see if we bug out.

54:15.402 --> 54:17.403
These kind of shows always
screw with their contestants.

54:17.488 --> 54:19.030
You guys want to go,
go ahead.

54:19.114 --> 54:21.074
I'm staying put
and winning the hundred Gs.

54:21.242 --> 54:22.867
Then they'll kill you, too.

54:22.952 --> 54:24.077
What?

54:26.789 --> 54:28.164
No!

54:28.249 --> 54:29.874
Nina? Nina!

54:34.255 --> 54:35.588
Get the fuck...

54:35.673 --> 54:37.382
That's Kimberly's tattoo.

54:38.259 --> 54:41.261
Holy shit!
That's her leg.

54:44.598 --> 54:45.932
That's it.

54:46.851 --> 54:49.060
Game's over.
Amber, let's go.

54:49.436 --> 54:50.728
Come on.

54:51.689 --> 54:53.106
Jonesy!

55:02.616 --> 55:04.492
They're fucking
cannibals, dude! Shut up.

55:04.577 --> 55:05.702
Where the hell's the RV?

55:05.786 --> 55:06.703
Just over the ridge.

55:06.787 --> 55:07.996
Keep quiet
and keep moving.

55:08.080 --> 55:09.122
I ain't stopping.

55:11.041 --> 55:12.417
My foot!

55:13.502 --> 55:14.586
Let me look at it.

55:14.670 --> 55:16.921
I'm a shark, man! I gotta keep moving
or I die. You know what I'm saying?

55:17.006 --> 55:18.006
Jonesy, shut the fuck up!

55:18.090 --> 55:19.674
Look, you guys
get to the RV, okay?

55:19.758 --> 55:21.217
We'll be
right behind you.

55:22.887 --> 55:24.012
This is going to suck.

55:25.139 --> 55:26.306
Shit!

55:28.350 --> 55:30.059
I need to put
pressure on that.

55:30.144 --> 55:32.770
Come on, give me your wristband. No.

55:32.855 --> 55:35.481
Look, you don't have
to hide anymore.

55:37.735 --> 55:39.360
How did you know?

55:39.695 --> 55:41.821
When I found out I'd
never play football again,

55:41.906 --> 55:43.865
I spiraled down
pretty hard.

55:43.949 --> 55:47.577
My therapist told me I should sit
in one of her suicide support groups.

55:47.661 --> 55:49.871
You know, give me
a better perspective.

55:49.955 --> 55:52.916
There was a girl that
used to do the same thing,

55:53.000 --> 55:54.417
only she used
a bandanna.

55:55.377 --> 55:56.753
So how old is the scar?

55:56.837 --> 55:58.087
About six months.

55:58.172 --> 55:59.672
What happened?

56:00.341 --> 56:04.177
I just trusted too many of
the wrong people. All my life.

56:04.261 --> 56:05.762
But I'm past it now.

56:05.846 --> 56:07.347
So it's old news?

56:08.349 --> 56:10.642
Why do you think
I came to win this game?

56:11.602 --> 56:14.187
Guess you'll get your
chance to do just that.

56:51.183 --> 56:54.352
You so much as fart, old
man, and I'll drop you.

56:56.230 --> 56:59.399
Don't kill me, brother.
I'm a good Christian man.

57:00.943 --> 57:02.110
Shit! Are you sure?

57:02.194 --> 57:03.987
Yeah, this was the place.

57:04.071 --> 57:06.823
Here are the tire tracks, the
empty equipment cases, the garbage.

57:06.907 --> 57:08.950
This is so F'd in the A.

57:11.161 --> 57:12.328
The fucking RV is gone!

57:12.413 --> 57:13.413
Let's just keep going.

57:13.497 --> 57:14.747
But we're dead meat.
Where to?

57:14.832 --> 57:16.165
The nearest town
is 50 miles away.

57:16.250 --> 57:17.959
We're all going to end up
hillbilly barbecue.

57:18.043 --> 57:20.003
I'm not going to tell
you again. Keep quiet!

57:20.087 --> 57:21.129
Then come on.

57:21.213 --> 57:23.172
No, no. There's that old paper
mill out by the main road.

57:23.257 --> 57:24.549
Right. You know,
it's abandoned.

57:24.633 --> 57:25.758
Well, we've got
to dig in somewhere.

57:25.843 --> 57:26.843
Maybe there's
a public phone.

57:26.927 --> 57:28.344
Dude, you know why
they call it abandoned?

57:28.429 --> 57:30.555
Because there's nothing in
it anymore, including phones!

57:30.681 --> 57:32.098
Hey!
Don't hurt me!

57:34.893 --> 57:36.561
That's a bear trap.

57:36.645 --> 57:37.854
There's no animals
around here.

57:37.938 --> 57:40.857
Why do they have
a fucking bear trap set?

57:40.941 --> 57:44.277
They're not trapping bears.
They're trapping people.

57:44.903 --> 57:48.948
There's no wildlife to eat
around here, they're eating us!

57:49.033 --> 57:50.700
Okay, I was wrong. The
paper mill's a great idea.

57:50.784 --> 57:51.868
Let's just
get out of here.

57:51.952 --> 57:53.369
No, no, no. Look, man,

57:53.454 --> 57:55.413
now we take the road, we're
sitting ducks, all right?

57:55.497 --> 57:59.042
So I want everyone to stick
together and watch where you step.

57:59.126 --> 58:00.626
Yeah, no shit.

58:03.130 --> 58:04.213
Yeah.

58:32.242 --> 58:34.285
Who you blowing up,
old timer?

58:34.369 --> 58:39.165
Just the trout. Only way to
bring them to the surface.

58:40.209 --> 58:42.251
Dynamite stuns them.

58:43.003 --> 58:47.090
They float like lily pads
and I just scoop them up.

58:53.180 --> 58:54.555
Pretty wife.

58:54.640 --> 58:56.891
Ah, that's my Delilah.

58:56.975 --> 59:00.770
Gave me the happiest days
of my life.

59:00.854 --> 59:02.271
God bless her soul.

59:03.524 --> 59:06.275
You know, you one
lucky son of a bitch.

59:06.777 --> 59:10.446
Lot of folk go in them woods.
Never seen one come out.

59:11.365 --> 59:13.783
Now, I stay clear
of them myself.

59:14.493 --> 59:16.536
How many of those freaks
are out there?

59:16.620 --> 59:18.162
Hard to know.

59:18.247 --> 59:21.040
More than the ones you run
across, that's for sure.

59:21.542 --> 59:23.042
What are they?

59:24.002 --> 59:29.632
Just like you and me, brother,
except uglier, and a lot stronger.

59:30.008 --> 59:33.553
Hey, I hit one of them
young'uns once in my pickup.

59:33.804 --> 59:36.722
He popped up
and just kept going.

59:37.850 --> 59:40.226
It's the chemicals
changed them.

59:40.519 --> 59:44.147
Pulp mill shut down
near 30 years ago,

59:44.565 --> 59:49.986
and left a mess, and the
poison killed off all the game.

59:50.237 --> 59:53.114
Most of the folks
around these parts left.

59:53.949 --> 59:57.910
There's one family
stayed on in this holler,

59:59.580 --> 01:00:03.875
and pretty soon their babies started
gushing out of their mama's womb,

01:00:03.959 --> 01:00:07.587
just as ugly as them trout
I got hanging out there,

01:00:10.591 --> 01:00:14.135
and then they grow up,
have kids of their own,

01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:18.306
turned out even worse.

01:00:20.642 --> 01:00:23.352
You going to stay
for a bite?

01:00:23.437 --> 01:00:26.439
Fish is ugly, but they fry up real good.

01:00:27.107 --> 01:00:30.234
No, much obliged,
but I got to get going.

01:00:33.906 --> 01:00:38.075
Well, if you're going to head out to
get your friends, settle the score,

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:40.953
best jump to it
before it gets dark.

01:00:41.288 --> 01:00:43.748
You don't want to be
out in them woods at night.

01:00:44.875 --> 01:00:46.459
Why do you stay,
old timer?

01:00:46.543 --> 01:00:48.628
Well, I could never leave.

01:00:51.632 --> 01:00:55.551
Got to stay close to my
young'uns. You motherfucker!

01:00:55.636 --> 01:00:58.304
I going to kill you, man!
I going to kill you!

01:00:58.388 --> 01:01:00.056
You killed my boy!

01:01:01.642 --> 01:01:03.142
I'll kill you!

01:01:04.353 --> 01:01:07.813
I'll kill you! I'll
kill you, motherfucker!

01:01:08.982 --> 01:01:11.400
I'll kill you,
motherfucker!

01:01:11.485 --> 01:01:13.653
I'll kill you!
I'm gonna kill you!

01:01:17.866 --> 01:01:20.243
I'll teach you
to mess with my kids.

01:01:30.295 --> 01:01:32.588
Say hello to
the missus for me.

01:02:12.379 --> 01:02:14.046
It's one of them.

01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:21.304
It's Elena.

01:02:21.388 --> 01:02:23.014
Yeah? What makes you
think that?

01:02:26.518 --> 01:02:27.560
Hey!

01:02:31.898 --> 01:02:33.316
Get off her!

01:02:36.445 --> 01:02:37.486
Oh, my God.

01:02:39.823 --> 01:02:41.198
Nina, wait!

01:02:46.246 --> 01:02:47.538
Oh, shit!

01:03:41.593 --> 01:03:43.386
Help me!

01:03:54.314 --> 01:03:56.148
Help!

01:04:00.487 --> 01:04:01.278
Where's Nina?

01:04:01.363 --> 01:04:02.905
She deserted us.

01:04:16.336 --> 01:04:17.920
Son of a bitch!

01:04:18.004 --> 01:04:19.338
Just keep moving.

01:04:20.841 --> 01:04:22.425
Look, split up.
I'll find Nina.

01:04:22.509 --> 01:04:23.843
We'll meet up
at the mill. Go.

01:04:37.941 --> 01:04:39.108
Nina.

01:04:39.192 --> 01:04:41.402
Help me! Help me!

01:04:41.486 --> 01:04:43.028
Nina?
Help me!

01:04:57.711 --> 01:04:58.836
Nina.

01:04:59.588 --> 01:05:00.921
Down here.

01:05:01.673 --> 01:05:03.466
Nina? Are you okay?

01:05:04.634 --> 01:05:06.010
I'm going to get you
out of there, all right?

01:05:06.094 --> 01:05:09.221
Look, come on.
Come on, Nina.

01:05:11.308 --> 01:05:12.308
I can't reach!

01:05:12.392 --> 01:05:13.726
Come on, Nina.

01:05:15.395 --> 01:05:16.604
Almost.

01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:19.690
Okay, hold on.

01:05:22.068 --> 01:05:23.777
I've got you, now.

01:05:41.087 --> 01:05:42.129
What happened?

01:05:42.214 --> 01:05:45.883
It's my shoulder.
It's dislocated.

01:05:45.967 --> 01:05:47.301
You've got to
help me pop it in.

01:05:48.136 --> 01:05:50.179
Nina, easy!

01:05:50.263 --> 01:05:52.014
Okay, pull and twist, okay?

01:05:52.349 --> 01:05:53.432
Go.

01:05:55.852 --> 01:05:57.228
Help me up.

01:05:58.522 --> 01:05:59.939
It's like going to war.

01:06:00.690 --> 01:06:03.609
Amber, Jonesy.
Did they make it?

01:06:03.693 --> 01:06:06.111
We all made it. We'll meet up
with them at the mill, okay?

01:06:07.948 --> 01:06:10.199
Let's go.
Let's go, let's go.

01:06:41.147 --> 01:06:42.815
Let's go.
Where?

01:07:25.483 --> 01:07:27.276
You totally kicked ass
back there.

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:30.863
I'm serious. You were like
Xena, Warrior Princess.

01:07:30.947 --> 01:07:33.449
You were right. I was
a total asshole before.

01:07:33.533 --> 01:07:36.285
I'm never going to dis you or
any other female ever again.

01:07:36.369 --> 01:07:37.661
Great.

01:07:38.038 --> 01:07:39.455
It's cool.
We outran them.

01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:41.790
Run.

01:07:49.633 --> 01:07:50.883
Come on.

01:07:52.761 --> 01:07:54.136
Oh, shit.

01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:55.471
Come on.

01:08:22.122 --> 01:08:22.997
Jonesy.

01:08:23.082 --> 01:08:24.291
Help me! Help me!

01:08:24.376 --> 01:08:27.169
Oh, shit. Amber.
Amber, help me.

01:08:27.252 --> 01:08:29.212
Jonesy!
Get me down. Get me down.

01:08:29.296 --> 01:08:31.215
Oh, no. Oh.

01:08:32.966 --> 01:08:34.926
Amber, Amber, help me!

01:08:37.138 --> 01:08:39.890
Oh, God. Hurry, Amber,
he's coming.

01:08:44.979 --> 01:08:46.188
Amber?

01:08:46.272 --> 01:08:47.564
Amber, go.
No!

01:08:47.607 --> 01:08:50.149
Amber, don't do this. Get
away. Go. I'm not leaving you!

01:08:50.234 --> 01:08:52.111
Run. No.

01:08:52.612 --> 01:08:53.946
Amber, no.

01:08:54.488 --> 01:08:56.615
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:08:59.661 --> 01:09:00.828
Amber?

01:09:01.955 --> 01:09:03.205
Oh, God.

01:09:03.790 --> 01:09:05.040
Jonesy.

01:09:08.627 --> 01:09:10.379
Jonesy,

01:09:11.631 --> 01:09:13.424
give me your hand.

01:09:37.448 --> 01:09:38.657
Huh?

01:09:45.957 --> 01:09:47.582
Don't look down.

01:09:51.254 --> 01:09:52.546
I'm here.

01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:55.507
Amber, I'm scared.

01:09:56.342 --> 01:09:58.010
You're not alone.

01:09:58.887 --> 01:10:01.847
All right, I'm going
to get us out of here.

01:10:02.932 --> 01:10:06.435
You know, my mother always
used to say I'd live for...

01:11:32.772 --> 01:11:34.189
There it is.

01:11:34.274 --> 01:11:36.233
Jonesy wasn't kidding.

01:11:36.901 --> 01:11:38.610
This place is dead.

01:11:51.332 --> 01:11:53.250
Birth defects, no shit!

01:12:05.305 --> 01:12:07.055
Can't see anything.

01:12:07.599 --> 01:12:10.475
How the hell are we going
to find them in here?

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.769
Let Amber and Jonesy find us.

01:12:13.521 --> 01:12:14.855
Where did you get that?

01:12:14.939 --> 01:12:15.939
I brought it with me
for the game.

01:12:16.024 --> 01:12:17.399
I thought it might
come in handy.

01:12:17.483 --> 01:12:18.567
That's cheating.

01:12:18.651 --> 01:12:19.735
Sue me.

01:12:26.159 --> 01:12:27.659
You think
they're up there?

01:12:27.744 --> 01:12:30.704
Maybe they found a CB
radio, called for help.

01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:34.416
I guess I'll go first.

01:12:37.462 --> 01:12:38.837
Be careful.

01:12:54.312 --> 01:12:57.022
They got to be
around here somewhere.

01:12:58.733 --> 01:13:01.193
If they even
made it here at all.

01:13:06.407 --> 01:13:08.533
Come on, guys,
where you at?

01:13:12.538 --> 01:13:16.166
Oh, my God.
She was just a little girl.

01:13:16.250 --> 01:13:17.501
Looks like she's
been in there forever.

01:13:17.585 --> 01:13:18.585
She's hiding.

01:13:18.670 --> 01:13:19.586
Yeah, but from whom?

01:13:19.671 --> 01:13:20.963
This isn't right.

01:13:23.299 --> 01:13:25.717
No, Nina. No, Nina!

01:13:25.802 --> 01:13:27.344
It's too late. We've got
to get out of here now!

01:13:27.428 --> 01:13:32.140
No! No, Nina. We cannot
leave them, okay? Let's go.

01:13:37.981 --> 01:13:39.898
Look, there's the RV.

01:13:40.191 --> 01:13:41.358
I don't see them.

01:13:41.442 --> 01:13:44.820
Oh, Jesus. This family's
been doing this for decades.

01:13:50.326 --> 01:13:52.869
Oh, my God. That sounds
like M screaming.

01:13:52.954 --> 01:13:55.080
Okay, I'm going down there.

01:14:03.089 --> 01:14:04.464
No, no, no, no.

01:14:05.675 --> 01:14:07.092
Hold this.

01:14:11.139 --> 01:14:12.431
Shit.

01:14:13.349 --> 01:14:15.100
Do you got my back?

01:14:19.772 --> 01:14:22.107
Please!
M? M!

01:14:22.191 --> 01:14:23.859
Come on, come on.

01:14:25.111 --> 01:14:27.821
Fuck! Fuck face.

01:14:27.905 --> 01:14:30.323
M. Get me the fuck out of here!

01:14:44.881 --> 01:14:46.048
M?

01:14:46.507 --> 01:14:48.800
No. Fuck, no!

01:14:50.178 --> 01:14:52.179
No, please!
Please, God, no!

01:14:52.263 --> 01:14:53.555
Please, don't. Please.

01:14:53.639 --> 01:14:55.474
M?
Please...

01:15:10.031 --> 01:15:13.492
Oh. Help.
Nina, it's a trap!

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Oh, shit!

01:15:22.085 --> 01:15:23.543
Shit.

01:16:10.258 --> 01:16:12.592
Brothers and sisters,
you must know

01:16:13.344 --> 01:16:18.849
that we live in a world of technology
that promotes sin, where the...

01:16:23.062 --> 01:16:27.732
...extracurricular sexual
activities, homosexuality...

01:16:29.652 --> 01:16:31.653
...to exercise...

01:16:32.321 --> 01:16:33.488
No!

01:16:43.249 --> 01:16:45.542
Would it be Heaven or
Hell that you decide?

01:16:45.626 --> 01:16:46.918
This is the crossroad...

01:16:56.929 --> 01:16:58.722
It is all a test.

01:16:59.432 --> 01:17:03.602
It is a test to show us
the way to find the light.

01:17:04.103 --> 01:17:06.771
This is what you need
to find your way.

01:17:07.315 --> 01:17:10.025
It gives you what you
need to find that light.

01:17:10.109 --> 01:17:12.194
To stay away
from the darkness,

01:17:12.278 --> 01:17:15.280
do not take wrong turns

01:17:16.115 --> 01:17:18.325
to living a life of sin,

01:17:20.244 --> 01:17:22.287
of personal destruction,

01:17:24.207 --> 01:17:27.042
a painful,
blasphemous life.

01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:31.087
Here I have the book
that will change your life,

01:17:31.172 --> 01:17:35.091
that will let you live
the way God has intended...

01:17:46.687 --> 01:17:50.523
...that living a life of
sin will only lead you to.

01:17:56.239 --> 01:17:57.489
Fuck you!

01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:12.170
Don't do it.
Leave her alone.

01:18:44.328 --> 01:18:45.912
Leave her alone!

01:18:46.956 --> 01:18:48.540
Leave her alone.

01:18:55.381 --> 01:18:57.257
Stop messing with her.

01:19:37.256 --> 01:19:40.008
What the fuck is wrong with you people?

01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:42.844
Amen.

01:19:42.928 --> 01:19:44.262
Amen.

01:20:13.125 --> 01:20:15.126
I hope you fucking choke!

01:20:19.965 --> 01:20:21.633
Leave her alone!

01:22:35.518 --> 01:22:37.310
Please, let us go.

01:22:41.273 --> 01:22:43.358
Come on, man. Help!

01:22:43.442 --> 01:22:49.531
Help.

01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:15.807
Help! Help!

01:23:19.645 --> 01:23:23.982
Help! Please! We're here. We're trapped!

01:23:24.066 --> 01:23:26.192
Please, someone, help us.

01:23:26.777 --> 01:23:27.860
Help us.

01:23:28.279 --> 01:23:30.113
Fuck!

01:25:54.007 --> 01:25:55.258
Oo-rah.

01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:10.481
Nina. Nina.

01:26:11.775 --> 01:26:14.444
Nina. Come on, wake up.

01:26:15.028 --> 01:26:16.571
Nina, wake up!

01:26:18.365 --> 01:26:20.825
Nina can you pull
your hands free?

01:26:23.704 --> 01:26:26.247
I need you to
pull your hands free.

01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:38.342
I can't.

01:26:38.427 --> 01:26:40.678
Nina, you've
got to try. Nina!

01:26:42.806 --> 01:26:44.849
Nina, wake up. Nina.

01:26:46.101 --> 01:26:48.144
Dale?
Be quiet.

01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:58.070
I got to do this.
Breathe through it.

01:27:01.408 --> 01:27:03.576
Ready? Okay.

01:27:04.036 --> 01:27:05.077
Go.

01:27:09.082 --> 01:27:10.416
One more.

01:27:16.006 --> 01:27:17.048
Go.

01:27:22.012 --> 01:27:23.221
Get up.

01:27:25.599 --> 01:27:27.725
There's an exit door
through there.

01:27:27.810 --> 01:27:29.977
I'll be right
behind you. Go.

01:27:41.281 --> 01:27:42.907
I want you
to go find Nina.

01:27:44.618 --> 01:27:45.743
Dale!

01:27:46.745 --> 01:27:48.871
Hey. Hey. Find Nina.

01:27:50.082 --> 01:27:51.707
Go! I've got it. Go!

01:28:04.471 --> 01:28:06.597
Is that all
you got, bitch?

01:28:27.411 --> 01:28:29.662
Fuck you. Fuck!

01:29:28.722 --> 01:29:31.641
Let go of me, you son
of a bitch! Let go of me!

01:29:37.314 --> 01:29:40.816
Let go. Let go of me!

01:29:40.901 --> 01:29:42.318
Let go of me!

01:29:42.527 --> 01:29:43.861
Shit!

01:29:44.738 --> 01:29:47.156
Let go of me,
you son of a bitch.

01:30:40.293 --> 01:30:41.585
Come on!

01:31:55.869 --> 01:31:59.205
You know you didn't have
to come back for me, right?

01:31:59.414 --> 01:32:00.581
Sue me.

01:32:07.172 --> 01:32:11.050
Wow. Nice ride.

01:32:12.010 --> 01:32:14.303
You want to take it
for a spin?

01:32:16.556 --> 01:32:17.890
Why not?

01:32:17.974 --> 01:32:20.309
It's the least this
fucked up family owes us.
