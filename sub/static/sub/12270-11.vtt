00:00.040 --> 00:04.560
Previously on The Evermoor Chronicles...
What's happening? Who are they?

00:04.760 --> 00:07.840
The Founders.
They're saying that it's you, Tara.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.360
It's you who have the old powers.

00:10.480 --> 00:13.960
You're releasing The Founders?
They brought the world to chaos.

00:14.080 --> 00:17.160
You must give us three Fated villagers
to inhabit.

00:17.360 --> 00:20.040
Where is the third? Where is our sister?

00:20.200 --> 00:22.080
I'm Cameron.
I'm Bella.

00:22.280 --> 00:24.200
I'm just gonna go.

00:24.400 --> 00:25.880
Tara!

00:26.000 --> 00:29.280
I turned Cameron into a tree.
And I can't turn him back.

00:29.440 --> 00:32.920
If you and Cameron kiss, it's over.
He'll go back to being a tree.

00:33.040 --> 00:34.480
From now on, no Cameron.

00:34.600 --> 00:38.400
Black thread. Someone kidnapped
your spider and made magic thread.

00:38.520 --> 00:44.160
Tapestry, Great Tapestry.
Tell what the future holds for Evermoor.

00:44.360 --> 00:49.000
What is that?
Prediction of the worst kind. Destruction.

00:49.120 --> 00:51.480
The destruction of the village.

00:53.760 --> 00:57.120
# I left my friends for my new life

00:57.320 --> 01:00.280
# How will I know it's gonna be all right?

01:00.440 --> 01:07.000
# I got to take control
And write my destiny

01:07.120 --> 01:12.440
# The future's still untold
Nobody else can see

01:12.560 --> 01:18.840
# If this will be for Evermoor #

01:28.120 --> 01:30.320
(BELLA SNIFFING)
Excitement.

01:30.480 --> 01:34.080
(SNIFFING)
Giddiness. Fear. And nausea?

01:34.280 --> 01:38.360
I just want tonight to be perfect.
The prom's my first real date with Sorsha.

01:38.480 --> 01:41.040
The first without her dad
breathing down my neck.

01:41.200 --> 01:43.440
You're all beautiful.

01:43.560 --> 01:46.160
Tara, lose the grin. You look drippy.

01:46.360 --> 01:50.080
Mom said Cameron can be my date for prom!
The Cam ban is lifted, Bella!

01:50.280 --> 01:51.760
For now.
(DOOR OPENS)

01:53.560 --> 01:54.880
Whose date are you?

01:55.000 --> 02:00.280
The tapestry has been attacked.
This is no time for your wit.

02:00.440 --> 02:02.880
Show me this act of vandalism.

02:06.640 --> 02:10.840
(SORSHA HUMMING)

02:11.000 --> 02:12.360
What was that?

02:12.480 --> 02:16.480
Your song, Father.
The one you used to sing me to sleep with.

02:16.600 --> 02:18.360
And I used to dream of this day.

02:18.480 --> 02:24.120
Of growing up, and being chosen,
going to the prom and seeing the boys.

02:24.320 --> 02:27.320
Don't sing that song here.
Not tonight, okay?

02:27.480 --> 02:32.480
Father, I was wondering if tonight
could be a little different.

02:32.640 --> 02:35.000
A little bit more like a prom-prom.

02:35.120 --> 02:38.440
I heard of this boy back in 1985
who tried to do just that.

02:38.560 --> 02:42.000
He tried to bring to the prom--
That boy failed. He was shamed.

02:42.160 --> 02:44.040
Banned from the prom thereafter.

02:44.200 --> 02:46.680
That's the last thing
I want to happen to you.

02:46.880 --> 02:48.560
But this is what people want.

02:48.760 --> 02:52.560
All you'd have to do is say the word.
I said no!

02:57.480 --> 02:59.880
This is a dark day, my friend.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.880
Dancing. Girls.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.320
Dancing with girls. Your basic nightmare.

03:05.480 --> 03:07.120
No, Jake.

03:07.320 --> 03:09.600
Read the pips!

03:11.440 --> 03:16.520
Uh, "The end of the juice is nigh"?

03:16.680 --> 03:21.280
"Tonight,
a supernatural force will attack."

03:21.440 --> 03:23.200
Don't you see?

03:23.400 --> 03:28.160
The black ring around the tapestry
already spells doom for Evermoor.

03:28.360 --> 03:31.600
But now we know doom is coming...

03:31.800 --> 03:33.080
to the prom.

03:35.600 --> 03:42.000
As darkness spreads across the tapestry,
so doom is coming to Evermoor.

03:42.160 --> 03:45.920
This room must be kept locked.
I will keep the key.

03:46.040 --> 03:48.640
Is that enough?
We need to find out who did this.

03:48.840 --> 03:50.840
It needs guarding.
Tara?

03:51.000 --> 03:53.480
You are not an Everine, dear.

03:53.600 --> 03:57.480
Kindly keep your "inspiration"
to yourself.

03:57.640 --> 04:01.320
But whoever did this wants to destroy
Evermoor. They could come back.

04:01.480 --> 04:03.000
Someone should be here.
Tara!

04:03.120 --> 04:05.680
Around the clock!
Very well.

04:05.880 --> 04:09.000
Summon the Circle Page,
Sebastian Crossley.

04:09.160 --> 04:10.560
Wait. What?

04:11.560 --> 04:16.120
Guarding the tapestry is
the traditional role of the Circle Page.

04:16.320 --> 04:19.200
But, but it's prom.

04:20.360 --> 04:21.920
(TARA SIGHS)

04:22.040 --> 04:25.760
You've caused chaos with
that ring prediction on the tapestry.

04:25.920 --> 04:28.680
We're so close to finding a host
for our sister.

04:28.880 --> 04:30.560
One more weaving is all we need.

04:30.760 --> 04:33.640
And now you appoint the Crossley boy
as tapestry guard?

04:33.840 --> 04:36.880
The Circle Page is an outsider.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.480
He has no sense of duty. It will take
little to tempt him away from his post.

04:41.600 --> 04:44.480
And then we shall weave our prediction.

04:47.880 --> 04:49.960
(SEB)
What? I'm not going to the prom?

04:50.080 --> 04:53.760
It's like my mouth is a marathon runner
and my brain is out of shape,

04:53.920 --> 04:58.480
trying to keep up.
This was going to be the perfect night.

04:59.520 --> 05:01.400
(SIGHS)

05:01.520 --> 05:07.200
(GASPS) Wait a second. The tapestry
has to be guarded by a Circle Page.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.440
But no one said which Circle Page.

05:09.560 --> 05:12.120
Maybe we pull a tapestry leaker out
to help us?

05:12.320 --> 05:14.320
Oh, that hasn't gone so great before.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.760
Only through misunderstanding.
I'll be really clear this time.

05:17.920 --> 05:22.280
If I can get a Circle Page out of the rip,
you can go to the ball.

05:23.480 --> 05:24.640
Concentrate.

05:24.840 --> 05:26.960
Tapestry, o tapestry.

05:27.080 --> 05:31.480
Please send us Evermoor's greatest
Circle Page to save our prom night.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.200

05:34.920 --> 05:38.360

05:44.760 --> 05:49.400
You, you see that?
Totally turned a trip into a dance move.

05:49.520 --> 05:51.400
Huh! Maybe this could work.

05:51.520 --> 05:54.440
Chess is my name,
and chess is not my game.

05:54.560 --> 05:58.360
So, your prom night needs saving?
You called the right Circle Page.

05:58.480 --> 06:01.440
So, you can guard the tapestry
while we're at prom?

06:01.560 --> 06:05.640
I solemnly swear that I will stay here
and guard the tapestry.

06:05.840 --> 06:09.000
Oh, thank you.
You've totally saved my night!

06:11.800 --> 06:14.360
Tonight, we're gonna party!

06:14.480 --> 06:15.800
(THUNDERCLAP)

06:15.960 --> 06:18.560
(FIONA)
So, Evermoor has a prom.

06:18.760 --> 06:22.640
Well, it's the last time I call this place
old fashioned.

06:29.080 --> 06:31.960
Okay, so where's the prom now?

06:32.960 --> 06:37.400
Right, well, you kids have fun.
(CHUCKLES)

06:41.400 --> 06:43.880
You made it!
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.680
But if you're here,
who's guarding the tapestry?

06:46.880 --> 06:51.000
Relax. The tapestry's in safe hands.
Now you two go have a good time.

06:51.160 --> 06:54.600
If you insist.
Even your dad can't ruin this one.

06:54.800 --> 06:57.120
(DOYLE) Good evening, everyone!

06:57.320 --> 07:01.360
According to joyful tradition, we begin
with the reading of the prom rules.

07:01.480 --> 07:04.520
One dance is permitted, the promenade.

07:04.680 --> 07:09.840
Girls and boys must remain
one prom stick apart

07:10.000 --> 07:13.080
at all times.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

07:16.920 --> 07:19.960
And promenade!

07:20.080 --> 07:23.400
(BELLA)
So, um, where's the music?

07:23.520 --> 07:24.600
Music?

07:24.800 --> 07:28.600
We dance to the rhythm of Destiny.
Tell me that's a band.

07:29.600 --> 07:31.840
And you, Bella. Much better.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.200
You know what would be much better? A DJ.

07:35.400 --> 07:37.920
Father, couldn't--
Sorsha, we talked about this.

07:38.040 --> 07:42.120
I've been around longer than you.
I know better. (SIGHS)

07:43.360 --> 07:46.000
I wish I knew how to stand up to him.

07:46.160 --> 07:48.040
So...

07:48.200 --> 07:54.360
has it always been this quiet?
Apart from the summer of 1985.

07:54.480 --> 07:56.840
(WHISPERS)
But we never talk about that.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.400
Oh, we should totally talk about that.

07:59.520 --> 08:02.440
(CRIMSON) Well...

No, that's a classmate.
This room is clean.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.680
Isn't it time you were convincing
our Circle Page to leave his post?

08:17.840 --> 08:20.280
No need. He came all by himself.

08:21.280 --> 08:26.360
Nothing so reckless as a teenager in love.
Fancy a walk to the tapestry room?

08:27.600 --> 08:31.200
We have a dark prediction to weave.

What are you doing here?
Following the rhythm of Destiny.

08:54.880 --> 08:58.640
If anything happens to that tapestry
while I'm supposed to be on watch,

08:58.800 --> 09:02.640
it's the end of me and Sorsha, for good.
You're guarding the tapestry!

09:02.800 --> 09:06.800
It's your duty, remember?
No. My duty is to save the prom.

09:06.960 --> 09:08.760
Like you asked.

09:08.920 --> 09:11.520
Bye-bye, tradition. Hello, party time.

09:11.680 --> 09:14.160
You. Are. Welcome.

09:14.320 --> 09:19.000
But that means
no one is guarding the tapestry.

09:19.120 --> 09:21.440
(GASPS)
Oh, no.

09:22.640 --> 09:26.200
Finally, the tapestry can reveal
the Fated one to us.

09:26.360 --> 09:28.760
And our sister will be free.

09:35.680 --> 09:39.280
Tapestry room. Now.
Want you to meet someone first.

09:44.040 --> 09:45.320
Tara, meet Tatty.

09:45.520 --> 09:46.800
Tatty, meet Tara.

09:46.960 --> 09:50.680
You brought the tapestry to prom?
This is not in the handbook.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.240
Tatty's my date.
Yes, she's on the quiet side.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.760
But there's something magical about her.

09:55.920 --> 09:58.880
I asked for the greatest Circle Page.
I got a comedian.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.320
Yeah, about that title. It was
an early example of Evermoorian sarcasm.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.960
This is going a little wrong,
don't you think?

10:07.440 --> 10:10.720
The tapestry was attacked
in the tapestry room.

10:10.880 --> 10:13.920
So sure, bringing it here is crazy.
But maybe it's safer?

10:14.040 --> 10:17.760
And if it's safe,
everyone can enjoy the prom, right?

10:20.160 --> 10:21.280
(BOTH)
Right.

10:30.960 --> 10:36.880
Can I interest you in one of my famous
gammon, garlic and goatberry pies?

10:37.000 --> 10:41.760
(SNIFFS, COUGHS) Thanks! But I'm allergic
to everything you're saying.

10:42.760 --> 10:46.000
Bella refused garlic.
Do you know what this means?

10:46.120 --> 10:49.880
She's going to kiss somebody.
No.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.400
It means she's not Bella.

10:53.600 --> 10:57.200
She's a vampire from the bog, a bogpire!

10:57.360 --> 11:00.520
And she's here to bring doom to Evermoor.

11:00.680 --> 11:03.440
Bella may be Bella, but she's not evil.

11:03.640 --> 11:08.520
Um, this is a prom, not a creche.
Now scram.

11:11.840 --> 11:16.200
Time for Bogpire to bite the dust.

11:21.200 --> 11:23.160
And what are we doing now?

11:23.320 --> 11:27.320
Reflecting on having fun
is a big part of having fun.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.360
Care to shuffle?

11:32.200 --> 11:34.240
Think it through, Crossley!

11:34.400 --> 11:38.760
If you interrupt her reflection, she'll
have to reflect on the interruption!

11:38.920 --> 11:42.280
Fate forbid anyone should have some fun,
am I right?

11:42.440 --> 11:45.200
I'm sorry, who are you
and why are you here?

11:45.360 --> 11:47.600
Excellent question.

11:47.760 --> 11:50.560
I'm here to bring the gift of music.

11:52.200 --> 11:53.880
"Chester Doyle."

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
(BOTH) Uh-hmm?
Uh, nothing.

11:57.120 --> 12:00.720
Who are you
to come stomping all over our traditions?

12:00.880 --> 12:02.640
Do you know why we have no music?

12:02.800 --> 12:07.000
Well, I'm guessing it's
because you're not much of a dancer.

12:07.120 --> 12:10.000
Sorsha, tell this young man
why we have no music.

12:10.120 --> 12:12.920
Because you're stuck in the past!

12:13.040 --> 12:14.200
I like this girl.

12:14.360 --> 12:16.800
You just listen to me.

12:16.960 --> 12:20.960
(BOTH)
I'm not going to let you ruin the prom!

12:22.080 --> 12:24.000
Sweet Veronica.

12:25.320 --> 12:30.360
Seb, I think our Circle Page
is a young Doyle.

12:30.560 --> 12:34.240
(GASPS) We brought out a young Doyle!
Oh, this is bad.

12:34.400 --> 12:38.440
Well, embarrassing.
No, no, this is really bad, Tara.

12:38.640 --> 12:40.960
Time travel shouldn't exist,
but if it does,

12:41.080 --> 12:44.680
and a person were to leap forward
and touch their older self,

12:44.840 --> 12:48.840
they could cause a cataclysmic implosion
in the fabric of time and space.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.120
"Doom to Evermoor."

12:50.280 --> 12:53.000
The prediction.
(YELLS) No!

12:53.160 --> 12:57.880
Cousin from out of town! There you are.

13:00.320 --> 13:05.240
The disaster the tapestry is predicting
is two Doyles creating a supernova?

13:05.400 --> 13:08.080
Would somebody tell me what's going on?

13:08.240 --> 13:11.800
I'm sorry, buddy. But you're...

13:13.760 --> 13:15.240
that guy.

13:18.360 --> 13:20.040
Prom prank. Good one.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.600
Seriously.

13:21.760 --> 13:24.400
1985. That was decades ago.

13:24.600 --> 13:27.120
That's how I turn out?

13:28.160 --> 13:30.120
So I failed.

13:30.280 --> 13:31.800
Failed at what?

13:32.800 --> 13:36.920
At ever bringing music to this prom.
I tried.

13:37.040 --> 13:41.160
The summer of 1985,
I was going to sing a song of my very own.

13:41.320 --> 13:47.200
I almost did it too. But the stuffy mayor
at the time stamped on my boombox.

13:47.360 --> 13:51.240
Caused an electrical fire,
which they blamed me for.

13:52.240 --> 13:54.760
I was banned from the prom forever.

13:57.200 --> 14:00.440
Tonight, I was going to put things right.

14:00.640 --> 14:03.120
Music would fix everything.

The snoot has arrived!

14:08.080 --> 14:12.880
Tell me you didn't bring a leaker?
I was trying to protect the tapestry.

14:13.000 --> 14:18.040
That doesn't protect the tapestry!
Um, guys. He's gone.

14:18.200 --> 14:22.400
(SIGHS) Why do they always do that?!
We cannot let them touch!

14:30.360 --> 14:32.800
Okay, bogpire.

14:32.960 --> 14:35.760
Time to say goodnight.

14:36.880 --> 14:38.200
(SPLASH)

14:39.240 --> 14:42.680
It wasn't me!
If you get anything on this dress--

14:44.000 --> 14:46.200
(POP)

14:48.760 --> 14:50.960
What goes around comes around.

14:51.080 --> 14:53.200
No, not there!
(SPLAT)

14:54.200 --> 14:57.280
(INDISTINCT CHUCKLING)
Awesome.

14:57.440 --> 15:00.000
What goes around comes around.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.960
Father, why are you so stuffy?

15:04.080 --> 15:08.240
I'm trying to protect you. To make sure
you don't make the same mistakes I did.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.800
What mistakes?
Can I help you?

15:10.960 --> 15:16.200
How did you end up like this?
"End up"? I'm the mayor of the village.

15:16.360 --> 15:19.040
My daughter is in the Circle--
Daughter?

15:19.200 --> 15:22.000
But I wanted to be in a band.

15:23.120 --> 15:25.560
(WHIRRING SOUND)

15:37.400 --> 15:41.160
What did you do?
That leaker is your dad.

15:41.320 --> 15:42.600
My bad.

15:42.760 --> 15:45.600
I'm so sorry, Sorsha,
but we need to find him.

15:45.760 --> 15:48.200
If he touches your dad--
Goodnight, Evermoor.

15:48.360 --> 15:50.800
I'll find him.
(GRAVEL CRUNCHING)

16:17.640 --> 16:19.960
You need to come with me.

16:21.240 --> 16:25.840
I can't be around you, sorry, too weird.
You don't think it's weird for me?

16:26.000 --> 16:29.800
I've always thought my father
was as straight as a wicker snick stick.

16:29.960 --> 16:32.200
Now you tell me he was in a band.

16:32.360 --> 16:33.720
Wanted to be.

16:33.880 --> 16:36.280
I threw all my dreams away.

16:37.280 --> 16:40.360
You know,
the future's not as bad as it seems.

16:40.560 --> 16:41.920
I become the mayor!

16:42.040 --> 16:45.520
Not just the mayor.
You're a teacher and a lawyer!

16:45.680 --> 16:46.680
A lawyer?

16:46.840 --> 16:51.000
Everybody looks up to my father.
He cares about this village.

16:51.120 --> 16:55.080
So do I! That's why I'm going to finish
what I started.

17:05.760 --> 17:06.760
He's here.

17:06.920 --> 17:09.920
Whatever happens,
keep him away from Doyle.

17:10.040 --> 17:14.920
I couldn't persuade him to go back,
and now he's on some sort of mission.

17:17.080 --> 17:19.760
We have to keep them apart.

17:19.920 --> 17:23.600
Okay, people.
We have a date with destiny tonight.

17:23.760 --> 17:26.800
After a lifetime of prom sticks,
I'm bringing funky back.

17:26.960 --> 17:30.160
You! Off the stage now!
(ELECTRICAL WHIRRING SOUND)

17:30.320 --> 17:33.880
Some supernova of doom.
Well, it was just a theory.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.600
If that's not the doom
the tapestry foretold...

17:36.760 --> 17:41.760
That means we've got even more
to look forward to. Great.

(TARA) We've been looking at this wrong.
Completion.

17:57.760 --> 18:00.080
Chess just had to do
what he came here to do.

18:00.240 --> 18:04.000
Sing his song
and he'll go back into the tapestry.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.200

20:05.200 --> 20:07.520
Next time on The Evermoor Chronicles...

20:07.680 --> 20:11.160
Tara Crossley, I regret to inform you
that you are to stand trial

20:11.320 --> 20:14.720
for the theft of
Evermoor's Grand Tapestry.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.080
Be honest.
(ESMERALDA) Unchosen!

20:18.200 --> 20:20.720
This lantern was repaired
with impure thread.

20:20.880 --> 20:25.520
Those who touch it who aren't Fated won't
walk away. The lantern will hurt them.

20:25.680 --> 20:28.800
Finally, Crossley girl
will be out of our way.
