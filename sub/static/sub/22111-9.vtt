WEBVTT

00:05.539 --> 00:08.109
MAN: All things
considered, darling,

00:08.142 --> 00:10.644
you've been treated pretty well.

00:12.513 --> 00:15.649
I think you'll grant me that.

00:15.683 --> 00:17.651
So why push your luck?

00:17.685 --> 00:19.653
Just tell me
what I want to hear.

00:19.687 --> 00:22.656
You've already figured out
what the alternative is.

00:22.690 --> 00:24.125
I... I just...

00:24.158 --> 00:26.794
What's that, darling?

00:26.827 --> 00:29.530
No, I-I didn't,
I didn't catch it.

00:29.563 --> 00:32.566
Now, come on, girl.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.168
Speak up.

00:34.202 --> 00:36.270
(both grunting)

00:36.304 --> 00:37.538
Hey, hey!

00:37.571 --> 00:39.473
Hey!

00:40.841 --> 00:42.410
Chain her to the floor!

00:42.443 --> 00:44.545
(grunting)

00:51.319 --> 00:53.321
(panting)

00:56.224 --> 00:58.692
(grunts)

01:08.736 --> 01:09.703
(chain rattling)

01:17.811 --> 01:19.247
(men screaming, shouting)

01:19.280 --> 01:21.115
(gunshots)

01:42.936 --> 01:45.139
(gunshots in distance)

02:03.957 --> 02:06.160
(door creaking)

02:19.340 --> 02:20.608
On your knees.
Hands behind your head.

02:27.781 --> 02:30.384
(panting)

02:30.418 --> 02:32.620
I need your help, Callen.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.491
*

02:55.743 --> 02:58.846
Yeah, 243 Lawson Avenue,
in Hancock Park.

02:58.879 --> 03:01.315
Just stay on 'em
until I contact you.

03:01.349 --> 03:03.417
Oh, and can you have Eric do a
background check on the husband?

03:03.451 --> 03:05.219
KENSI (over phone):
Got it. Callen, be careful.

03:05.253 --> 03:06.720
I know, I will. Thanks, Kens.

03:06.754 --> 03:08.589
Of course.

03:11.992 --> 03:13.561
The shirt's yours.
I'm guessing the jeans

03:13.594 --> 03:15.429
belong to Anna Kolcheck.

03:17.865 --> 03:20.501
Kensi and Deeks are keeping
an eye on your family.

03:20.534 --> 03:21.469
I need to call my husband,
tell him

03:21.502 --> 03:22.703
to get my son ready
for when they arrive.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.004
They're not making contact.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.706
This is strictly overwatch.

03:25.739 --> 03:27.441
No, Callen, I told you,
they're in danger.

03:27.475 --> 03:28.576
That's not good enough.

03:28.609 --> 03:29.843
It's gonna have to be, Joe.

03:29.877 --> 03:32.313
The only reason I'm
doing this is because

03:32.346 --> 03:33.514
there's a kid involved.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.383
Anything beyond that,
I seem to remember

03:35.416 --> 03:37.518
that you've got
a lot of friends at the CIA.

03:37.551 --> 03:38.652
Not for months.

03:38.686 --> 03:40.421
They've disavowed
all knowledge of me.

03:40.454 --> 03:41.722
Oh, you mean they fired you?

03:41.755 --> 03:42.723
No, I quit.

03:42.756 --> 03:45.293
Believe it or not,
I was not privy to everything

03:45.326 --> 03:46.694
the rogue CIA group was doing.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.696
But after I learned
the extent of their activities,

03:48.729 --> 03:49.963
after they turned me
on you, I...

03:52.366 --> 03:53.501
(sighs)

03:53.534 --> 03:54.968
Okay, you don't
have to believe me.

03:55.002 --> 03:57.838
But you're the only one
I can trust now, so...

03:57.871 --> 03:59.573
Do you have any food?

03:59.607 --> 04:01.409
I haven't eaten in 48 hours.

04:10.984 --> 04:14.488
I'm sorry, I'm, uh,
all out of Nutella.

04:14.522 --> 04:16.857
I also noticed you got rid
of the dining room table.

04:16.890 --> 04:21.495
Just so we're clear,
I don't believe you.

04:21.529 --> 04:23.964
Not a word.

04:23.997 --> 04:26.600
I'll get you to your family.

04:26.634 --> 04:30.604
Whatever trouble you're in,
it's got nothing to do with me.

04:30.638 --> 04:33.006
That's where you're wrong,
Callen.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.643
It has to do
with national security.

04:44.485 --> 04:47.888
After a couple months out
of the CIA, I let my guard down.

04:47.921 --> 04:48.756
And it didn't happen right away.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.325
Just gradually,
I fell into a routine.

04:51.359 --> 04:53.060
It's hard not to when
you have a kid to drop off

04:53.093 --> 04:55.696
at school every day.
That's when they got me.

04:55.729 --> 04:58.332
Two days ago,
after dropping him off,

04:58.366 --> 05:00.067
they got me at a stop sign,
threw me into a van.

05:00.100 --> 05:02.069
What intersection?

05:02.102 --> 05:03.671
Gifford and Palm.

05:03.704 --> 05:05.339
SAM:
What about your car?

05:05.373 --> 05:07.808
If you left it there,
somebody might've reported it.

05:07.841 --> 05:09.677
I think someone jumped in
and drove it away,

05:09.710 --> 05:11.412
but I'm not sure.

05:11.445 --> 05:12.480
Get a look at their faces?

05:12.513 --> 05:13.881
No, they were wearing masks.

05:13.914 --> 05:14.948
And they put a hood on me
right away.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.950
Never took it off.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.952
Accents?

05:18.986 --> 05:20.087
American.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.689
Maybe from the South.

05:21.722 --> 05:23.491
But I only ever heard
one of them speak.

05:23.524 --> 05:25.025
Based on his questions,

05:25.058 --> 05:27.428
I would say he worked for
a foreign intelligence agency.

05:27.461 --> 05:28.862
Chinese,

05:28.896 --> 05:30.831
Russian, ISI.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.366
They wanted intel.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.435
Including naval intelligence.

05:36.136 --> 05:37.438
(exhales)

05:37.471 --> 05:39.673
I admit, I gave them what I had,

05:39.707 --> 05:42.376
but it was all at least
six months out of date.

05:42.410 --> 05:44.578
I knew it was just
a matter of time

05:44.612 --> 05:46.113
before they realized
it was useless,

05:46.146 --> 05:48.949
and I-I didn't think there was
a chance they would let me go.

05:48.982 --> 05:50.584
So I escaped.

05:50.618 --> 05:53.020
How?

05:53.053 --> 05:54.422
(laughs softly)

05:54.455 --> 05:56.524
You're not gonna believe me.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.693
That's a given.

06:01.429 --> 06:03.597
JOELLE:
I gouged out my guard's eye

06:03.631 --> 06:04.998
with my interrogator's
collar stay.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.867
Stole another guard's gun,

06:06.900 --> 06:08.669
shot the others.

06:13.441 --> 06:15.609
Did you check the collar
on that shirt?

06:23.684 --> 06:26.053
JOELLE
Not that you believe me.

06:30.023 --> 06:32.526
Where'd they hold you?

06:32.560 --> 06:33.927
Warehouse district downtown.
Look, I can direct you there,

06:33.961 --> 06:36.029
but it's pointless, they're not
gonna be there anymore.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.731
If anything, they're gonna be
out looking for me,

06:37.765 --> 06:39.733
and the first place
they will go is my house.

06:39.767 --> 06:41.769
Callen, I need to see my family.

06:41.802 --> 06:44.204
SAM:
Agent Wilson.

06:44.237 --> 06:47.508
Please take her
in the interrogation room.

06:57.585 --> 06:59.987
(door closes)

07:00.020 --> 07:01.922
What do you think?

07:01.955 --> 07:05.826
Former CIA,
falls into a routine.

07:05.859 --> 07:08.996
History of corruptibility.

07:09.029 --> 07:11.999
Seems like the perfect target.

07:12.032 --> 07:13.567
Maybe too perfect.

07:14.702 --> 07:15.803
What about you,

07:15.836 --> 07:17.705
Assistant Director?

07:17.738 --> 07:20.073
In my experience,

07:20.107 --> 07:22.242
you don't admit to violating
the Espionage Act

07:22.275 --> 07:24.512
unless you fear something worse.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.079
Agent Callen, as much as I wish

07:26.113 --> 07:27.180
you would have booted your ex
out the door

07:27.214 --> 07:29.717
the minute she arrived,
I'm afraid this is a threat

07:29.750 --> 07:31.151
we can't ignore.

07:31.184 --> 07:32.486
ERIC:
Assistant Director?

07:32.520 --> 07:33.420
MOSLEY:
What is it?

07:33.453 --> 07:34.888
We checked for a camera
at the intersection

07:34.922 --> 07:37.057
of Gifford and Palm,
where Joelle was taken.

07:37.090 --> 07:38.926
Claims that she was taken.

07:38.959 --> 07:41.895
Uh, well, it may be
more than a claim.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.931
This was from two days ago.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.101
Good operatives avoid cameras.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.037
This could've been staged.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.739
MOSLEY: Agreed. But if
a foreign intelligence agency

07:51.772 --> 07:55.275
is actively seeking
classified naval intelligence,

07:55.308 --> 07:57.978
we have to investigate.

07:58.011 --> 07:59.179
She fooled you once, boys.

07:59.212 --> 08:01.248
Don't let it happen again.

08:21.068 --> 08:22.903
Thank you for the clothes.

08:22.936 --> 08:24.538
And tell Anna thank you, too.

08:24.572 --> 08:27.207
From what I've read,
she's quite the woman.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.810
You bring her up again,
and we're done here.

08:30.811 --> 08:33.113
Sorry.

08:33.146 --> 08:35.649
We need to talk
about your husband.

08:35.683 --> 08:37.084
Nick? What do you want to know?

08:37.117 --> 08:38.786
Is he real?

08:38.819 --> 08:40.320
Or is he
just, uh...

08:40.353 --> 08:42.122
the perfect cover for you?

08:42.155 --> 08:44.124
Well, who says he can't be both?

08:45.358 --> 08:47.060
Can you tell?

08:48.295 --> 08:50.030
Then, let's go.

08:50.063 --> 08:51.064
Hold on a second.

08:51.098 --> 08:52.600
You've been gone for 48 hours.

08:52.633 --> 08:53.667
What does he think
you're doing?

08:53.701 --> 08:54.935
Uh, don't worry about it.

08:54.968 --> 08:56.904
He's used to me leaving
at a moment's notice.

08:59.673 --> 09:01.241
He knows about the CIA?

09:01.274 --> 09:04.878
He knows enough not to ask me
too many questions.

09:05.913 --> 09:07.948
Marriage requires
trust, Callen.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.817
Nick trusts me.
Huh.

09:09.850 --> 09:10.918
End of story.

09:10.951 --> 09:12.352
He trusts you.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.987
I almost feel sorry for him.

09:14.021 --> 09:15.723
You know, don't be. You know,
and while you're at it,

09:15.756 --> 09:17.691
why don't you stop
feeling sorry for yourself?

09:17.725 --> 09:20.060
You're not upset
because I betrayed you.

09:20.093 --> 09:23.363
You're upset because
you didn't figure it out.

09:23.396 --> 09:26.333
Look, neither of us is innocent.

09:26.366 --> 09:28.335
But my family is.

09:28.368 --> 09:30.237
That's who we need
to worry about.

09:30.270 --> 09:32.272
(door opens)

09:32.305 --> 09:35.743
Agent Wilson, put her in
the car for me, please.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.246
(door opens)

09:41.081 --> 09:42.916
(door closes)

09:42.950 --> 09:46.253
Hidoko followed
Joelle's directions.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.656
She thinks she found where
she was being held downtown.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.057
Well, that could be a trap.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.992
You should go with Hidoko.

09:52.025 --> 09:54.628
Maybe you should.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.334
Okay.

10:01.368 --> 10:02.936
We'll keep Joelle contained

10:02.970 --> 10:05.372
until we can
verify her claim.

10:12.379 --> 10:13.346
No movement yet.

10:13.380 --> 10:14.481
CALLEN: All right.
Interesting.

10:14.514 --> 10:16.349
Thanks, Kensi.
All right, I'll
see you in a bit.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.351
Hmm.
Callen and Joelle
are on their way.

10:18.385 --> 10:19.720
All right,
listen to this.

10:19.753 --> 10:20.821
The spider can be

10:20.854 --> 10:22.690
interpreted symbolically
as either

10:22.723 --> 10:24.758
negative or positive.

10:24.792 --> 10:26.760
It most often represents
the feminine power

10:26.794 --> 10:28.128
to entrap or to dominate.

10:28.161 --> 10:29.262
(moans)

10:29.296 --> 10:30.430
Seriously, Deeks. Enough.

10:30.463 --> 10:33.433
Such as an overbearing
mother figure.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.302
So, uh, how has Julia been?

10:35.335 --> 10:37.170
Has she been on your case
about our wedding plans?

10:37.204 --> 10:38.438
What wedding plans, Deeks?

10:38.471 --> 10:40.040
Exactly. Did she say that?

10:40.073 --> 10:41.274
Deeks, my mom has been great.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.043
It was a dream, okay?

10:43.076 --> 10:44.111
It didn't mean anything.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.713
Let's just forget
I said anything.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.047
So you dream
you're getting married

10:47.080 --> 10:48.916
to your ex-fiancé, Jack,
and when he puts

10:48.949 --> 10:51.084
the ring on your finger,
it turns into a spider,

10:51.118 --> 10:53.220
(laughing): and you think
that doesn't mean anything?

10:53.253 --> 10:54.722
No. I think it
was random

10:54.755 --> 10:56.389
electrical impulses firing
in my brain, that's all.

10:56.423 --> 10:57.457
Really?

10:57.490 --> 10:59.727
Because this website says
that if you're dreaming

10:59.760 --> 11:01.862
about your ex,
you're actually dreaming about

11:01.895 --> 11:03.196
your current relationship.

11:03.230 --> 11:05.398
So that would mean
that Jack was me,

11:05.432 --> 11:07.968
and I gave you a spider,
which is an overbearing mother,

11:08.001 --> 11:09.302
which is my mother.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.104
Oh, my God,
I gave you my mother.

11:11.138 --> 11:12.139
(laughs softly)

11:12.172 --> 11:13.473
Wow, that's awkward.

11:13.506 --> 11:14.808
Why is that awkward?

11:14.842 --> 11:16.076
'Cause I kind of-sort of...

11:16.109 --> 11:18.278
squished the spider.

11:18.311 --> 11:20.013
You squished my mom.

11:20.047 --> 11:21.148
I squished a spider.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.182
You squished my mom.

11:22.215 --> 11:23.216
I didn't squish your mom.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.284
You squished Bertie.
I love your mom.

11:24.317 --> 11:25.485
Okay? Let's just drop it.

11:25.518 --> 11:26.720
Gonna drop it.

11:26.754 --> 11:28.188
'Cause you're right, I'm sorry.

11:28.221 --> 11:29.790
Thank you.
Just breathe.

11:29.823 --> 11:30.924
Breathe with me.

11:30.958 --> 11:32.425
(exhales)

11:32.459 --> 11:34.828
Speaking of which,
I, uh, forgot to mention,

11:34.862 --> 11:36.229
my mom put together another...

11:36.263 --> 11:38.098
another binder
of flower arrangements.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.833
She wants to go over
when you have a chance.

11:39.867 --> 11:40.968
Are you kidding me?

11:41.001 --> 11:42.903
That's like five b--

11:42.936 --> 11:44.104
oh, wait.

11:44.137 --> 11:46.506
You're messing with me.
(laughs)

11:46.539 --> 11:48.108
You're not funny.
It's pretty funny.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.110
That's not funny.
I'm pretty sure I just saw

11:50.143 --> 11:51.344
those random electrical
pulses shooting out

11:51.378 --> 11:53.013
of your ears right there.
You're the worst.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.782
You're literally the worst.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.249
Speaking
of female entrapment,

11:56.283 --> 11:58.118
here comes the
black widow now.

11:59.820 --> 12:02.155
NICK: All right, buddy.
Got your homework?

12:02.189 --> 12:03.190
PETER: Yup.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.858
Okay. Let's see.

12:04.892 --> 12:06.794
Two legs, two eyes, two ears.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.061
Show me a muscle. Nice.

12:08.095 --> 12:09.196
You're all set, buddy.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.397
Cool.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.399
Mom!

12:12.432 --> 12:14.301
My little peanut.

12:14.334 --> 12:15.302
Ah, I missed you so much.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.104
We missed you.

12:17.137 --> 12:18.238
Hey.

12:18.271 --> 12:21.842
Callen. We, uh, we met before.
Right.

12:21.875 --> 12:22.943
You work with Beth, right?

12:22.976 --> 12:23.944
Just in the
neighborhood again?

12:23.977 --> 12:26.313
Nick, not now.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.115
This is Agent Kensi Blye,

12:28.148 --> 12:29.817
Detective Marty Deeks.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.118
You and Peter need to go
with them right now.

12:31.151 --> 12:33.286
You'll need
his booster seat.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.355
Of course.

12:35.388 --> 12:37.557
Beth, what's going on?

12:37.590 --> 12:38.926
I'll explain later.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.127
Will you?
It's fine.

12:40.160 --> 12:43.196
Okay? You have to trust me.

12:43.230 --> 12:46.066
Okay.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.468
Mom, I want to go to school.

12:48.501 --> 12:49.837
There's a field trip
to the zoo.

12:49.870 --> 12:52.139
Oh, honey. We'll
go another day.

12:52.172 --> 12:54.842
But you get to go on a
field trip with Daddy now.
Yeah.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.276
Are you coming, too?

12:56.309 --> 12:58.145
I'll join you as soon as I can.

12:58.178 --> 13:00.447
I promise.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.582
(sighs)

13:02.615 --> 13:04.451
Okay.

13:04.484 --> 13:07.054
It'll be okay.

13:07.087 --> 13:08.455
Kensi, Deeks.
KENSI: Yeah.

13:08.488 --> 13:10.190
Got 'em.
Come on, kiddo.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.191
You good?
Yeah.

13:11.224 --> 13:12.225
Hey.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.965
We're not staying here.

13:17.998 --> 13:20.033
Callen, it's safe.
Believe me.

13:20.067 --> 13:21.134
I mean, there's
cameras everywhere,

13:21.168 --> 13:24.171
state-of-the-art security
system, several panic rooms.

13:24.204 --> 13:25.172
Well, that all sounds charming,

13:25.205 --> 13:26.606
but I'm not giving you
home field advantage.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.075
(engine starts)

13:28.108 --> 13:30.210
Besides, I have a safer place.

13:43.390 --> 13:45.092
Safer?

13:45.125 --> 13:46.626
You're joking.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.261
It also doubles
as a panic room,

13:48.295 --> 13:49.496
but only when it's sinking.

13:49.529 --> 13:51.498
How many people
know about this?

13:51.531 --> 13:52.699
Just my team.

13:52.732 --> 13:57.370
This is the last place anyone
would think to look for you.

14:11.018 --> 14:14.087
This is where Joelle
said she was held.

14:14.121 --> 14:15.388
According to Eric,

14:15.422 --> 14:18.191
it's owned by a defunct
Chinese real estate firm.

14:18.225 --> 14:20.293
Everything okay?

14:20.327 --> 14:21.995
Yeah, I'm just waiting
to hear from G.

14:22.029 --> 14:24.164
Thought you said you weren't
worried about him.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.666
(scoffs) I'm not worried about
him. I'm worried about my boat.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.235
Put a lot of
work into it.

14:28.268 --> 14:29.369
And you don't trust
Callen and Joelle

14:29.402 --> 14:31.104
not to ruin it?

14:31.138 --> 14:32.940
I don't trust much
when it comes to her.

14:32.973 --> 14:35.142
But then, with all due
respect, Agent Hanna,

14:35.175 --> 14:36.209
why are we going along
with this?

14:36.243 --> 14:37.177
I read the reports.

14:37.210 --> 14:40.047
Joelle played you, Callen
and Hetty for years.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.415
As far as I can tell,
no one's ever done that before,

14:42.449 --> 14:44.184
so who's to say she's not trying
to play us again?

14:44.217 --> 14:47.054
Well, she might be, but if
Joelle is telling the truth,

14:47.087 --> 14:48.188
we have an obligation.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.456
That's the oath we took.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.992
Yeah, and what if Joelle is just
taking advantage of that oath?

14:52.025 --> 14:53.560
What if she's counting on us
coming here?

14:53.593 --> 14:56.296
I've considered that, too.

14:56.329 --> 14:58.631
Still doesn't change the fact
we have to go in there.

15:28.628 --> 15:32.065
HIDOKO:
Clear.

15:32.099 --> 15:34.101
Clear.

15:50.517 --> 15:52.119
Hidoko.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.487
In here.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.127
They cleared out fast.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.029
Didn't even clean up.

16:02.062 --> 16:04.631
I saw blood droplets
in the sink down the hall.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.099
This room matches
Joelle's description

16:06.133 --> 16:07.034
of where she was held.

16:07.067 --> 16:11.671
So far, everything seems
to verify her story.

16:11.704 --> 16:13.640
We're on camera.

16:18.145 --> 16:19.379
It's a steel door.

16:19.412 --> 16:20.547
There's no way
we're busting through that.

16:22.715 --> 16:25.285
Okay, but I don't see
any other way out.

16:26.319 --> 16:27.787
All right.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.522
If I'm right, there shouldn't be
anything on the other side

16:29.556 --> 16:31.324
of this wall.
Tear the padding off!

16:31.358 --> 16:32.659
Okay.

16:32.692 --> 16:35.128
Pull the pads down.

16:35.162 --> 16:36.129
(grunts)

16:36.163 --> 16:37.430
Hidoko, over here.

16:37.464 --> 16:38.465
(grunting)

16:41.168 --> 16:42.169
Sam.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.208
You okay?

16:48.241 --> 16:49.276
Yeah. You?

16:49.309 --> 16:51.144
Yeah.

16:52.445 --> 16:55.448
Now I'm really worried
about my boat.

17:06.626 --> 17:09.729
Fire department found
a cell phone detonator.

17:09.762 --> 17:12.165
They think it ignited
a flammable liquid.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.666
It was a kill room.

17:13.700 --> 17:17.137
Well, found this
router inside.

17:17.170 --> 17:18.738
It might've been
connected to the camera.

17:18.771 --> 17:19.772
If we can recover any data,

17:19.806 --> 17:21.408
it might tell us
who was watching

17:21.441 --> 17:22.642
or at least
where they were.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.111
You should get this
over to Eric.

17:24.144 --> 17:25.245
I've seen him
tackle much worse.

17:25.278 --> 17:26.479
Already gave him
a heads-up.

17:26.513 --> 17:28.148
He also discovered
that the Chinese firm

17:28.181 --> 17:31.451
who owns this building is a
subsidiary to a shell company.

17:31.484 --> 17:33.620
So, basically, we don't know
who we're dealing with.

17:36.156 --> 17:38.125
(sighs)

17:38.158 --> 17:39.426
Hey, Sam.

17:40.860 --> 17:42.795
I wanted to say thank you.

17:42.829 --> 17:45.398
If you hadn't found that exit,
we would both be dead.

17:45.432 --> 17:49.169
You think that was Joelle's plan
all along?

17:49.202 --> 17:51.771
I'm not so sure.

17:51.804 --> 17:52.639
I mean, there's a lot easier

17:52.672 --> 17:54.307
and less elaborate ways
to kill someone.

17:54.341 --> 17:56.609
So you don't think
she's playing us?

17:56.643 --> 18:00.347
Well, we need to get
more information first.

18:00.380 --> 18:02.315
Like you said, we don't know
who we're dealing with.

18:07.854 --> 18:09.822
Oh, yeah.

18:09.856 --> 18:12.825
I'll be sure to ask her.

18:12.859 --> 18:14.727
Was that about Nick and Peter?

18:14.761 --> 18:15.895
Are they okay?

18:15.928 --> 18:17.297
Oh, they're fine.

18:17.330 --> 18:18.498
Sam, on the other hand,

18:18.531 --> 18:19.832
narrowly escaped a fire
at your warehouse.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.868
A fire? What do you mean?

18:21.901 --> 18:23.703
I mean that he was done
clearing the place

18:23.736 --> 18:25.205
when the room he was in
sealed up tight

18:25.238 --> 18:26.339
and caught on fire.

18:26.373 --> 18:27.307
That must've been meant for me

18:27.340 --> 18:29.476
when they were done
with their questions.

18:29.509 --> 18:30.643
Well, did he see the bodies?

18:30.677 --> 18:32.612
I mean, I got
to hand it to you,

18:32.645 --> 18:35.315
when you commit to a story,
you really commit.

18:35.348 --> 18:37.217
You think I set this up?

18:37.250 --> 18:39.186
Let's just say
it's not looking good.

18:39.219 --> 18:41.554
Callen, don't you get it?

18:41.588 --> 18:43.823
You're so worried about me
deceiving you again,

18:43.856 --> 18:46.226
you can't even see when
you're deceiving yourself.

18:46.259 --> 18:48.295
I didn't try to kill Sam.

18:48.328 --> 18:50.463
I... there must be
another explanation.

18:50.497 --> 18:51.864
Or the simplest one.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.400
You're lying.

18:55.435 --> 18:58.238
This was a mistake.

18:58.271 --> 19:00.507
I don't know why I ever
thought you'd help me.

19:00.540 --> 19:03.376
If you leave this boat,

19:03.410 --> 19:06.646
your family goes back home.

19:06.679 --> 19:09.849
You do know that.

19:20.227 --> 19:21.361
DEEKS: They're gonna
call him White Chocolate.

19:21.394 --> 19:22.462
That's how smooth he is.

19:22.495 --> 19:23.630
White Chocolate
gets the rock.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.565
He's from outside.
Three, two, one.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.267
Cash!

19:27.300 --> 19:28.968
All right, ready
from the canoe.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.169
Looks like they're
having fun.

19:30.203 --> 19:32.372
From the outside. He's never
made it from the canoe before.

19:32.405 --> 19:34.607
One more.
He's a good kid.

19:34.641 --> 19:35.942
Which one of them?

19:35.975 --> 19:36.943
DEEKS: Yeah!

19:36.976 --> 19:37.944
Smart, too.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.879
All right, time out.

19:39.912 --> 19:42.415
Knows when something's wrong.

19:42.449 --> 19:43.816
We'll have you guys back
to your normal lives

19:43.850 --> 19:45.252
as soon as possible.

19:45.285 --> 19:48.555
Hmm. "Normal."

19:48.588 --> 19:50.990
I don't think that's
ever applied to us.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.625
Ah, Beth made sure of that.

19:52.659 --> 19:55.662
She never shared the details
of her work with me,

19:55.695 --> 19:58.698
of course, but after a while,

19:58.731 --> 20:00.500
she stopped sharing
anything else,

20:00.533 --> 20:03.603
you know, her thoughts,
her feelings.

20:03.636 --> 20:07.707
Things haven't been right in
our marriage for a long time.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.742
Was that why you had the affair?

20:11.744 --> 20:13.446
Sorry. It's just in
situations like this,

20:13.480 --> 20:16.449
we have to investigate every
avenue a threat could come from.

20:16.483 --> 20:18.485
So, we looked into
your bank statements,

20:18.518 --> 20:20.753
your phone records,
and we found...

20:20.787 --> 20:21.988
Sarah.
Sarah. Yeah.

20:22.021 --> 20:24.591
She worked at my office for
two years. She's not a threat.

20:24.624 --> 20:26.025
I understand, but we do
have to be thorough.

20:26.058 --> 20:26.993
Good.

20:27.026 --> 20:28.828
Then you know that I ended it
three months ago

20:28.861 --> 20:30.330
and I told Beth everything.

20:30.363 --> 20:33.266
You know what she said
when I told her?

20:33.300 --> 20:35.735
No.
That she knew.

20:35.768 --> 20:38.505
She knew the entire time

20:38.538 --> 20:41.641
and she-she didn't stop it.

20:44.344 --> 20:47.414
You know, it always killed me
when she slept with other men,

20:47.447 --> 20:51.017
but the difference is,
is that was her job.

20:51.050 --> 20:54.687
I couldn't do anything
about that.

20:54.721 --> 20:59.058
But she...
she could've stopped me.

20:59.091 --> 21:02.662
You know? She could have...
(inhales sharply)

21:02.695 --> 21:05.765
...she could have
at least tried and...

21:05.798 --> 21:08.000
she didn't.

21:08.034 --> 21:11.037
You know,
we were never

21:11.070 --> 21:13.072
a normal family.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.741
(sighs)

21:14.774 --> 21:15.942
But now I'm starting to wonder

21:15.975 --> 21:19.412
if it wasn't all
just based on a lie.

21:25.885 --> 21:28.321
I'll get this router
to Eric.

21:52.679 --> 21:54.681
So... what do you think,
Agent Hanna?

21:54.714 --> 21:58.017
(chuckles)
It's nice.

21:58.050 --> 22:00.953
Nice? That's it?

22:00.987 --> 22:01.954
Well, I guess we
can say good-bye

22:01.988 --> 22:03.690
to Hetty's open-door policy.

22:03.723 --> 22:06.793
Did you ever consider how
Hetty's door was always open,

22:06.826 --> 22:08.861
but she always kept secrets?

22:08.895 --> 22:10.730
She gave you the illusion
of access,

22:10.763 --> 22:12.899
but it was never
really granted.

22:12.932 --> 22:14.801
Here, it's the opposite.

22:14.834 --> 22:18.571
All I ask is that you knock.

22:18.605 --> 22:21.374
That's good to know.
Now,

22:21.408 --> 22:23.610
tell me why I shouldn't
pull Callen from the case.

22:23.643 --> 22:27.380
No one distrusts Joelle
more than he does.

22:27.414 --> 22:29.549
And no one was hurt
as much as he was.

22:29.582 --> 22:30.583
Are his emotions

22:30.617 --> 22:31.851
gonna be a problem?

22:31.884 --> 22:33.119
I wouldn't call him emotional.

22:33.152 --> 22:35.054
He's cautious.

22:35.087 --> 22:37.757
But that can change if he
catches her in another lie.

22:37.790 --> 22:40.627
I don't like operating
with this level of uncertainty.

22:42.995 --> 22:45.465
I read your report
on Joelle,

22:45.498 --> 22:46.966
and there's a lot here.

22:46.999 --> 22:48.167
But when you get
right down to it,

22:48.200 --> 22:50.002
we know next to nothing
about this woman.
(phone vibrates)

22:50.036 --> 22:52.539
Is that Callen?

22:52.572 --> 22:53.673
Sabatino.

22:53.706 --> 22:56.476
He's a CIA officer who...
I, I know.

22:56.509 --> 22:58.645
I read your reports.

22:58.678 --> 23:00.413
What does he say?

23:00.447 --> 23:01.581
Well, I contacted
him earlier today

23:01.614 --> 23:02.849
to cross-check
Joelle's story--

23:02.882 --> 23:04.617
the one about her
leaving the CIA.

23:04.651 --> 23:07.920
He says she's still active.

23:07.954 --> 23:10.022
(sighs)

23:10.056 --> 23:11.624
Well, then, I guess
I'm gonna get

23:11.658 --> 23:13.059
the answer to my question.

23:23.202 --> 23:25.171
Thought you said you
hadn't eaten in 48 hours.

23:25.204 --> 23:28.174
I'm not really
a veggie-dog girl.

23:28.207 --> 23:30.510
Take it up with Sam.
That's all he had.

23:30.543 --> 23:31.511
It's fine.

23:31.544 --> 23:34.013
Lost my appetite, anyway.

23:38.485 --> 23:39.686
Beth or Joelle?

23:40.953 --> 23:43.690
Which one were you born with,
Beth or Joelle?

23:43.723 --> 23:45.458
Neither.

23:45.492 --> 23:46.959
When I joined the CIA,

23:46.993 --> 23:48.861
they scrubbed
my original identity.

23:48.895 --> 23:50.697
Completely?

23:51.964 --> 23:53.800
That's rare.

23:53.833 --> 23:55.968
My background wasn't
useful to them.

23:56.002 --> 23:57.604
Better to create
a whole new identity,

23:57.637 --> 24:00.172
or two.

24:00.206 --> 24:01.908
So, you haven't been
yourself for...

24:01.941 --> 24:04.544
Almost 20 years.

24:04.577 --> 24:07.113
Hmm.

24:07.146 --> 24:08.848
Well, we have time.

24:11.117 --> 24:13.052
I'd like to hear about her.

24:14.754 --> 24:16.088
(door opens)

24:16.122 --> 24:19.225
Well, your boat is
still in one piece,

24:19.258 --> 24:21.561
as promised.

24:33.272 --> 24:35.207
What's it like, Joelle?

24:35.241 --> 24:36.809
To have no allegiance,

24:36.843 --> 24:39.145
no trust, no loyalty
to anyone but yourself?

24:39.178 --> 24:41.113
Callen, I don't know
what you're talking about.

24:41.147 --> 24:42.882
You're still in the CIA.

24:42.915 --> 24:45.585
That's not true.
Not exactly.

24:45.618 --> 24:46.753
G.

24:46.786 --> 24:47.820
Why did you even
come to me for help?

24:47.854 --> 24:49.155
You know what, don't even
start, 'cause every word

24:49.188 --> 24:50.657
that comes
out of your mouth is a lie.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.592
Look, I needed your help.
That's the truth.

24:52.625 --> 24:54.694
And, yes, I lied,
but only because

24:54.727 --> 24:56.763
I didn't think you'd help me
if you knew the real reason.

24:56.796 --> 24:58.130
That is the only way
I would help you,

24:58.164 --> 24:59.566
and you're smart enough
to know that.

24:59.599 --> 25:01.868
I was afraid.

25:01.901 --> 25:03.870
Oh, come on, Joe, really?

25:03.903 --> 25:05.805
Are you even capable of fear?

25:05.838 --> 25:08.174
How about love, huh?

25:08.207 --> 25:10.943
'Cause I know your husband
has some doubts about that one.

25:12.645 --> 25:14.013
You want the truth?

25:14.046 --> 25:16.148
It's a little late for that.

25:16.182 --> 25:19.686
The truth is, I wasn't kidnapped
by a foreign

25:19.719 --> 25:20.787
intelligence agency.

25:20.820 --> 25:22.922
I was kidnapped
by the rogue CIA group

25:22.955 --> 25:23.990
that I used to belong to.

25:24.023 --> 25:26.726
That's a nice try.
We destroyed them. Turn around.

25:26.759 --> 25:28.260
(sighs)
Yeah, not everybody.

25:28.294 --> 25:30.329
Not the man
behind the curtain.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.298
The wonderful Wizard of Oz.

25:32.331 --> 25:33.900
Let me guess, we find
a ruby slipper,

25:33.933 --> 25:35.167
and you can go home again.

25:35.201 --> 25:36.603
Okay, he grabbed me
because

25:36.636 --> 25:38.037
he wants to rebuild the group.

25:38.070 --> 25:41.040
He made my choice clear--
either I join or I die.

25:41.073 --> 25:42.141
But I-I'm done with them.

25:42.174 --> 25:43.743
Your husband doesn't
even trust you.

25:43.776 --> 25:44.911
Why the hell should we?!

25:44.944 --> 25:46.713
How many times
do I have to say it?

25:46.746 --> 25:48.981
I don't need you
to trust me!

25:49.015 --> 25:51.150
I need you to keep
my family safe!

25:54.220 --> 25:55.888
Okay, I believe you.

25:55.922 --> 25:57.590
(closes handcuffs)
Sam?

25:57.624 --> 25:59.792
She's telling the truth.

25:59.826 --> 26:02.829
Next time, save us some
trouble-- start with it.

26:04.063 --> 26:05.164
"Next time"?

26:05.197 --> 26:08.200
Why do you b...
What changed?

26:08.234 --> 26:10.036
Nothing.

26:10.069 --> 26:12.204
Actually, you were
very consistent.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.974
Everything you did was
to protect your family.

26:15.975 --> 26:18.144
So, so that was all an act?

26:18.177 --> 26:20.680
(phone vibrates)
I don't know that
I'd go that far.

26:20.713 --> 26:22.682
What is it?

26:22.715 --> 26:24.583
It's my house.

26:26.252 --> 26:28.821
They look like your kidnappers.

26:28.855 --> 26:30.322
SAM:
After Hidoko and I got caught
on camera at the warehouse,

26:30.356 --> 26:33.159
they must have figured out
NCIS was involved.

26:33.192 --> 26:35.628
They wanted to see who
you'd run to for help.

26:35.662 --> 26:38.097
Your friends at the CIA
have been to my house before.

26:38.130 --> 26:40.032
We may not be safe here.

26:40.066 --> 26:41.834
Sorry to bring this
to your doorstep again.

26:41.868 --> 26:43.803
Technically, it's already
past my doorstep.

26:43.836 --> 26:45.872
But thanks anyways.

26:56.182 --> 26:57.249
Do we have them?

26:57.283 --> 27:00.086
I sent LAPD and a few agents
over to Callen's house,

27:00.119 --> 27:02.121
but the intruders left
before they got there.

27:02.154 --> 27:03.289
And I could only
track them

27:03.322 --> 27:04.824
as far as
the freeway,

27:04.857 --> 27:05.892
then I lost them.

27:05.925 --> 27:07.760
Where is Joelle now?

27:07.794 --> 27:09.161
She's in the car,
driving with Callen.

27:09.195 --> 27:11.297
Moving target is harder to hit.

27:11.330 --> 27:12.899
Okay, this has
gone far enough.

27:12.932 --> 27:16.135
Call the CIA and put it
through to my office.

27:18.871 --> 27:20.339
She is their problem,

27:20.372 --> 27:22.108
and never should
have been ours.

27:25.277 --> 27:26.779
Hold off on that
for the moment?

27:26.813 --> 27:28.815
Okay.

27:30.482 --> 27:32.819
Save your breath, Agent Hanna.

27:32.852 --> 27:33.786
This is cut and dry,

27:33.820 --> 27:36.455
and you know it.
What about Joelle's family?

27:36.488 --> 27:38.390
That's for the CIA to decide.
As for NCIS,

27:38.424 --> 27:40.993
we will not be directing any
more resources to this case,

27:41.027 --> 27:42.762
if you can even
call it a case.

27:42.795 --> 27:44.063
(sighs)

27:44.096 --> 27:45.932
End of discussion,
Agent Hanna.

27:45.965 --> 27:47.333
Was that not clear?

27:47.366 --> 27:49.969
If that rogue CIA group
is still active,

27:50.002 --> 27:51.971
they're a threat to us.

27:52.004 --> 27:53.405
You've read the report.

27:53.439 --> 27:56.108
I have, and I think I learned
a valuable lesson.

27:56.142 --> 27:57.977
While Hetty's methods

27:58.010 --> 27:59.478
were effective,
they also bred chaos

27:59.511 --> 28:00.913
and almost destroyed
this office.

28:00.947 --> 28:03.182
If this group is
still active,

28:03.215 --> 28:04.917
we will handle them.

28:04.951 --> 28:06.152
But we're gonna do it my way.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.154
Understood?

28:08.187 --> 28:09.856
Understood.
(knock on door)

28:09.889 --> 28:11.423
Come in.
Uh, sorry to interrupt.

28:11.457 --> 28:13.225
I... Oh, it's nice.

28:13.259 --> 28:15.027
Um, I've been trying
to restore

28:15.061 --> 28:16.195
the burnt router
from the warehouse,

28:16.228 --> 28:17.496
and I think I got something.

28:17.529 --> 28:19.231
Do you know where
the camera feed was going?

28:19.265 --> 28:20.800
No. Uh, maybe.

28:20.833 --> 28:23.803
It used a VPN and proxy
servers to mask the IP,

28:23.836 --> 28:26.806
but I was able to pull the
serial number from the metadata.

28:26.839 --> 28:28.741
The router was purchased
in a bulk order

28:28.775 --> 28:30.877
from one Manticore
Mineral Group.

28:30.910 --> 28:32.411
They're an international
mining company

28:32.444 --> 28:34.513
that's done business
with the Chinese corporation

28:34.546 --> 28:36.348
that owns the warehouse.

28:36.382 --> 28:38.985
Putting the CIA
aside for a second,

28:39.018 --> 28:40.887
we need to investigate
the fire.

28:40.920 --> 28:43.122
It did almost kill
two NCIS agents.

28:43.155 --> 28:44.390
Okay.

28:44.423 --> 28:46.125
I will authorize
the surveillance

28:46.158 --> 28:48.260
on the Mineral Group.

28:48.294 --> 28:50.296
But tread lightly.
We'll need Joelle.

28:50.329 --> 28:51.998
She's the only one
that can I.D. the guy

28:52.031 --> 28:53.199
who held her in the warehouse.

28:53.232 --> 28:54.433
I thought she never
saw his face.

28:54.466 --> 28:57.503
She didn't.
She heard his voice.

28:57.536 --> 28:59.438
(phone ringing)

29:03.175 --> 29:04.443
MOSLEY:
Yes?

29:04.476 --> 29:08.247
I have the deputy director's
office on the line.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.449
Tell him I'll
call him back.

29:12.418 --> 29:14.921
You have two hours.

29:14.954 --> 29:16.956
Great.

29:27.499 --> 29:29.401
G, we're in position.

29:29.435 --> 29:30.302
CALLEN (over comm):
Yeah, we are, too.

29:30.336 --> 29:31.938
We're just getting things
set up here.

29:31.971 --> 29:34.040
How's the food today?

29:34.073 --> 29:35.474
CALLEN:
All out of tacos.

29:35.507 --> 29:38.444
All we've had so far
are veggie dogs.

29:38.477 --> 29:40.312
What kind of a maniac
only has veggie dogs?

29:40.346 --> 29:43.149
Yeah, the kind that regrets
letting you use his boat.

29:43.182 --> 29:46.052
Look, you bought that
under an alias,

29:46.085 --> 29:47.586
you move it to a new dock
every few days.

29:47.619 --> 29:48.687
They won't find it.

29:48.720 --> 29:50.957
You definitely should think
about moving, though.

29:50.990 --> 29:51.858
All right, well, if you're
offering me a cabin

29:51.891 --> 29:53.292
on your new boat,
I have one request--

29:53.325 --> 29:54.426
all-beef hot dogs.

29:54.460 --> 29:56.462
All right, Eric, send the comms

29:56.495 --> 29:58.064
through our system here.

29:58.097 --> 29:59.465
ERIC (over comm):
You got it, Callen.

29:59.498 --> 30:02.201
I'll be there soon, Nick,
I promise. I love you.

30:06.238 --> 30:07.373
Hey, thanks for
letting me call them.

30:07.406 --> 30:10.242
No problem.

30:12.244 --> 30:13.312
You don't approve.

30:15.214 --> 30:16.482
I didn't say anything.

30:16.515 --> 30:18.250
You didn't have to.

30:18.284 --> 30:20.119
You don't think
I should have a family

30:20.152 --> 30:22.221
and this job.

30:22.254 --> 30:23.956
(sighs)

30:23.990 --> 30:25.457
It's your life, Joe.

30:25.491 --> 30:26.959
But it's also theirs.

30:26.993 --> 30:28.594
Right.

30:28.627 --> 30:30.229
I suppose you said
the same thing to Sam

30:30.262 --> 30:31.497
after Michelle was taken?

30:31.530 --> 30:33.866
Now, that is not...
Not fair?

30:33.900 --> 30:36.102
No, it's not.
But he's a man.

30:36.135 --> 30:38.504
(laughs)
It's okay for him
to have it all.

30:38.537 --> 30:40.639
I don't care that you have
a job and a family, okay.

30:40.672 --> 30:43.042
What I care about is
that you made a mistake,

30:43.075 --> 30:45.144
and you're afraid
to admit it for some reason.

30:47.546 --> 30:49.882
Sabatino told you
I was still in the CIA.

30:49.916 --> 30:52.218
Did he also happen
to mention that

30:52.251 --> 30:54.386
I've been placed on leave
pending an investigation?

30:57.223 --> 30:59.992
I did make
a mistake, Callen,

31:00.026 --> 31:01.994
and I have no doubt
that I will pay for it.

31:02.028 --> 31:05.264
But I was also
doing my job,

31:05.297 --> 31:06.332
just like you do your job,

31:06.365 --> 31:07.934
just like Sam does his.

31:07.967 --> 31:11.403
And I will fight to
keep doing my job,

31:11.437 --> 31:13.872
just like I will fight
to keep my family safe.

31:15.241 --> 31:16.475
Is that too much to ask?

31:16.508 --> 31:21.213
No. It's not.

31:21.247 --> 31:24.250
But at least Michelle knew
what the risks were.

31:24.283 --> 31:26.552
Can you say the same thing
about Nick?

31:29.055 --> 31:31.290
DEEKS (over comm): All right,
Callen, we're in position.

31:31.323 --> 31:32.959
We're ready.

31:37.396 --> 31:41.000
3-D microphone is hot.

31:41.033 --> 31:43.002
Same here.

31:43.035 --> 31:44.703
DEEKS:
All right, we're all systems go.

31:44.736 --> 31:45.837
ERIC: Okay.
With these 3-D mics...

31:45.871 --> 31:48.140
Mm-hmm.
...Joelle will be
able to hear the voices

31:48.174 --> 31:50.476
like she's right there
in the room with them.

31:50.509 --> 31:52.344
NELL:
So, for instance,

31:52.378 --> 31:54.713
if someone makes a noise
on the left side of the mic,

31:54.746 --> 31:56.515
Joelle will hear it
on her left side.

31:56.548 --> 31:58.284
She'll even be able
to gauge distance.

31:58.317 --> 32:00.019
And she should be able
to direct Kensi and Deeks

32:00.052 --> 32:01.687
to the right voice.
Oh, my God.

32:01.720 --> 32:03.255
(overlapping chatter)
So cool.

32:03.289 --> 32:04.290
Wait for me.

32:04.323 --> 32:05.457
(laughs)

32:05.491 --> 32:06.692
Ooh, and weird.

32:06.725 --> 32:08.594
ERIC: I know, right?
Assistant Director,

32:08.627 --> 32:10.596
you have to try these
headphones; it's an experience

32:10.629 --> 32:12.464
like no other.
You're loud, Eric.

32:12.498 --> 32:14.033
Okay.
You did say

32:14.066 --> 32:15.401
"it's like being
in a room with them."

32:15.434 --> 32:17.169
Uh, yeah, it is.

32:17.203 --> 32:19.205
But it's like...
I've been in rooms before.

32:19.238 --> 32:21.073
We're in a room right now.

32:21.107 --> 32:23.342
I don't need the headphones.

32:23.375 --> 32:25.011
DEEKS:
Hi, Stephen, good to see you.

32:25.044 --> 32:26.312
Things good?
STEPHEN: Things are great.

32:26.345 --> 32:28.014
Yeah, yeah? Good, good, good.

32:28.047 --> 32:29.181
Glad to hear it.

32:29.215 --> 32:30.482
Randy?
Uh-huh.

32:30.516 --> 32:31.683
DEEKS:
Like that shirt.

32:31.717 --> 32:33.685
Really taking advantage of that
casual Friday, aren't you?

32:33.719 --> 32:34.753
RANDY:
Uh, it's Wednesday.

32:34.786 --> 32:36.622
DEEKS:
And, uh...

32:36.655 --> 32:38.757
How about you... Rudy.

32:38.790 --> 32:41.327
(laughs): Rudy.
Cashmere sweater, V-neck.

32:41.360 --> 32:43.095
You're rocking it,
you're rocking it.

32:43.129 --> 32:44.596
Looking sharp.
Thanks, man.

32:44.630 --> 32:46.765
Sorry, I'm, uh, I'm new.

32:46.798 --> 32:48.367
Are you Bradley?

32:48.400 --> 32:49.701
Larry.

32:49.735 --> 32:51.370
DEEKS:
You sure about that?

32:51.403 --> 32:52.638
'Cause Larry's supposed
to be sick today.

32:52.671 --> 32:53.672
LARRY:
Clearly, I'm fine.

32:53.705 --> 32:54.773
No, no, it's not him.

32:54.806 --> 32:56.375
Deeks, move on.

32:56.408 --> 32:58.044
Okay, moving on.

32:58.077 --> 32:59.545
Can I get my mail, please?
Oh, yeah,

32:59.578 --> 33:02.381
I got no mail for Bradley.
Bradley's got no mail.

33:02.414 --> 33:03.549
I'm not-- I just said...

33:03.582 --> 33:05.484
I just said...
No mail for you!

33:13.792 --> 33:15.994
(door opens)

33:17.529 --> 33:19.531
(overlapping chatter)

33:22.601 --> 33:24.136
MAN:
These numbers look good.

33:24.170 --> 33:25.271
Kensi, that guy

33:25.304 --> 33:27.673
right behind you, get closer.

33:27.706 --> 33:28.774
KENSI:
Would you like some coffee, sir?

33:28.807 --> 33:29.841
No. Thanks.

33:29.875 --> 33:32.611
I'm already at my daily
allotment.
KENSI: Okay.

33:32.644 --> 33:34.546
INTERROGATOR:
Come on over here, darling.

33:34.580 --> 33:36.715
I'll take that coffee.

33:36.748 --> 33:37.749
Afternoon, gentlemen.

33:37.783 --> 33:40.119
We'll begin in a moment.

33:44.490 --> 33:47.059
KENSI:
Here you go.

33:47.093 --> 33:48.560
Thank you, darling.
KENSI: Uh, would you like

33:48.594 --> 33:49.395
some sugar with that?
No.

33:49.428 --> 33:51.430
KENSI: Okay.
That's him, isn't it?

33:51.463 --> 33:54.166
Yeah.

33:54.200 --> 33:57.136
ERIC: That's Colton Leach,
VP of operations at Manticore.

33:57.169 --> 33:59.238
Any indication he's CIA?

33:59.271 --> 34:01.107
If there is, I'm not seeing any.

34:01.140 --> 34:03.175
Manticore does have interests
in the Middle East

34:03.209 --> 34:05.244
and Afghanistan, though.
That's where

34:05.277 --> 34:07.413
the rogue CIA group
performed their wet work.

34:07.446 --> 34:08.847
All right, well,
if we access his home computer

34:08.880 --> 34:10.082
and his cell phone...

34:10.116 --> 34:10.916
MOSLEY:
Agent Callen,

34:10.949 --> 34:12.451
what you are asking for
is illegal.

34:12.484 --> 34:13.519
We need more than

34:13.552 --> 34:15.354
Joelle's word to move
on this guy.

34:15.387 --> 34:17.256
I understand, but under the...
MOSLEY: I'm sorry.

34:17.289 --> 34:18.624
Your two hours are up.

34:18.657 --> 34:19.758
I'm calling the CIA.

34:21.327 --> 34:23.095
(tires screeching)

34:23.129 --> 34:26.165
G, incoming. It looks like the
same van that kidnapped Joelle.

34:26.198 --> 34:27.733
Hey, we got to get out of here.

34:29.301 --> 34:30.636
(tires screeching)

34:30.669 --> 34:32.571
CALLEN:
We're boxed in.

34:32.604 --> 34:34.240
That's not gonna be easy.

34:39.278 --> 34:41.113
Federal agents!
Weapons down!

34:45.651 --> 34:46.785
(gunfire)

34:49.388 --> 34:52.324
(gunshots)

34:52.358 --> 34:53.659
I can help.

34:53.692 --> 34:56.462
(gunshots)

34:56.495 --> 34:58.130
(beeps)

35:03.835 --> 35:05.437
Back up.

35:10.376 --> 35:11.610
(yells)

35:15.281 --> 35:16.382
Joelle, stay inside!

35:16.415 --> 35:17.683
Joe!

35:21.787 --> 35:24.590
(gunfire)

35:39.505 --> 35:42.274
How the hell did they find her?
I don't know.

35:42.308 --> 35:44.843
Well, you'd better figure it
out and send them some backup.

35:44.876 --> 35:47.579
(gunshots over comm)

35:51.717 --> 35:53.852
Kensi, Deeks,
Joelle went inside.

35:53.885 --> 35:55.787
I think she's going for Leach.

35:55.821 --> 35:56.888
Sam, I'm going in.

35:56.922 --> 35:58.490
Covering you now.

36:00.259 --> 36:01.893
(gunfire)

36:07.633 --> 36:09.768
(nervous chatter)

36:09.801 --> 36:11.670
Mr. Leach,
I'm a federal agent.

36:11.703 --> 36:12.971
You're in immediate danger.

36:13.004 --> 36:15.441
Am I now?
Yes, you need to come with me.

36:15.474 --> 36:17.343
Well, thank you
for your offer, darling.

36:17.376 --> 36:18.977
But I've got my own protection.

36:19.010 --> 36:20.712
(people shouting)

36:20.746 --> 36:23.315
KENSI: Deeks, coming your way!
Down, down! LAPD!

36:24.650 --> 36:25.717
Ah, son of a...

36:29.955 --> 36:32.324
(gunshots)

36:36.928 --> 36:38.897
(Deeks grunts)

36:38.930 --> 36:40.366
Is that you or Joelle?

36:40.399 --> 36:42.801
Get to the street,
back up Sam and Hidoko.

36:42.834 --> 36:44.436
Callen, wait.

36:57.949 --> 36:59.385
He's retreating.

36:59.418 --> 37:00.852
Push forward.
Watch for traps.

37:06.892 --> 37:08.394
IED!

37:17.969 --> 37:19.705
(tires screeching)

37:35.421 --> 37:37.289
(sighs)
Looks like I owe you this time.

37:38.690 --> 37:39.658
You saved my life.

37:39.691 --> 37:41.026
Yeah, but then you went
and saved mine again,

37:41.059 --> 37:43.429
like, two seconds later.

37:43.462 --> 37:44.863
Give an agent her moment
next time.

37:47.666 --> 37:49.601
Easy, girl.

37:49.635 --> 37:50.836
Think about it.

37:50.869 --> 37:54.005
You really gonna shoot
a wounded, unarmed man?

37:55.507 --> 37:56.975
Joe, wait.

37:57.008 --> 37:59.445
Callen, as long as he's alive,
my family will never be safe.

37:59.478 --> 38:00.712
(laughs):
Oh, darling...

38:00.746 --> 38:01.780
You think I'm it?

38:01.813 --> 38:03.782
I'm just one of many.

38:03.815 --> 38:06.284
We call it a syndicate
in the business world.

38:07.619 --> 38:09.721
You're not CIA?

38:09.755 --> 38:11.857
No. We never were.

38:11.890 --> 38:14.460
We just saw an advantage to
owning a piece of the CIA.

38:14.493 --> 38:17.929
They can secure our business
interests overseas.

38:17.963 --> 38:20.666
That venture failed,
as you recall.

38:20.699 --> 38:23.335
Turns out the CIA
isn't so good

38:23.369 --> 38:25.337
at securing the Middle East.
(groans)

38:25.371 --> 38:28.507
Then what do you want with me?

38:28.540 --> 38:30.642
Oh, we got a better plan
this time.

38:30.676 --> 38:33.345
I want you to be a part of it.

38:33.379 --> 38:36.081
The CIA is just gonna
toss you aside.

38:36.114 --> 38:39.084
They don't understand that
you were born for this.

38:39.117 --> 38:40.352
But I do.

38:40.386 --> 38:42.821
Civilian life
doesn't suit you.

38:42.854 --> 38:43.955
The husband,

38:43.989 --> 38:46.825
the kid, soccer practice?

38:46.858 --> 38:50.496
It's all such a drag.

38:50.529 --> 38:52.330
You know I'm right.

38:54.966 --> 38:56.468
Joe.

39:05.010 --> 39:06.478
JOELLE:
Callen.

39:10.549 --> 39:12.017
Eric, get me an ambulance.

39:12.050 --> 39:13.385
Joelle's been shot.

39:14.420 --> 39:15.821
It's okay.
It's okay, Joelle.

39:15.854 --> 39:18.390
Stay with me.
Stay with me.

39:18.424 --> 39:19.825
Keep your eyes open, Joe.

39:19.858 --> 39:22.661
Joe, keep your eyes open.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.663
Not Joe.

39:24.696 --> 39:25.964
Jane.

39:40.546 --> 39:41.847
How's Joelle?

39:44.149 --> 39:45.551
NELL:
Oh, man.

39:46.852 --> 39:49.020
What about Callen?
Where is he?

39:49.054 --> 39:51.857
He's still at the hospital
with her body.

39:51.890 --> 39:53.659
Go home.

39:53.692 --> 39:55.126
It's been a long day.

40:10.842 --> 40:12.444
(knocks)

40:12.478 --> 40:13.812
Come in.

40:13.845 --> 40:16.548
I have an update.
Great.

40:16.582 --> 40:18.717
We found an app running in
the background of Nick's phone.

40:18.750 --> 40:21.587
It traces all of his
outgoing and incoming calls.

40:21.620 --> 40:24.756
Like the one Joelle placed to
him from outside Manticore.

40:24.790 --> 40:26.124
So that's how
they tracked her down.

40:26.157 --> 40:28.760
Mm-hmm.
Who put the program
in his phone?

40:28.794 --> 40:30.829
We followed up on the woman
Nick was having an affair with.

40:30.862 --> 40:32.531
She didn't show up for
work this morning,

40:32.564 --> 40:33.665
and she cleared out
her apartment.

40:33.699 --> 40:37.536
We believe she was keeping
tabs on Joelle through Nick.

40:37.569 --> 40:40.606
And I thought D.C.
was full of rats.

40:42.140 --> 40:44.009
Nice work, Harley. Thanks.
Thank you.

40:57.155 --> 40:59.157
*

41:08.567 --> 41:10.401
They deserve to know the truth.

41:14.272 --> 41:16.642
They deserve to be safe.

41:16.675 --> 41:19.277
My death ensures that.

41:19.310 --> 41:21.146
The truth will come later.

41:21.179 --> 41:23.114
CALLEN:
Right.

41:23.148 --> 41:24.650
After you've hunted down
the rest

41:24.683 --> 41:27.653
of the so-called Syndicate.

41:27.686 --> 41:30.689
It'll take me
a while to recover.

41:30.722 --> 41:33.859
I could use some help.

41:33.892 --> 41:36.662
I got my own family
to take care of.

41:39.898 --> 41:42.133
Thank you, Callen.

41:42.167 --> 41:45.003
For everything.

41:45.036 --> 41:46.237
Wait.

41:58.684 --> 42:01.286
Okay... go.

42:05.591 --> 42:07.593
