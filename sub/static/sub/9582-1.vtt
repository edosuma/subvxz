REPORTER: Coach Royal, I'm Casey
Addison from The Daily Texan.

01:28.171 --> 01:30.132
<i>ROYAL: Hello. Hey, sit down.</i>

01:30.507 --> 01:31.633
REPORTER: Thanks
for meeting with me.

01:31.717 --> 01:32.884
Sure. Sure.

01:35.512 --> 01:36.930
Coach, I'm writing a story

01:37.014 --> 01:39.182
about legendary
Texas football players,

01:39.349 --> 01:40.642
and you're a legend yourself.

01:43.353 --> 01:44.563
Was I a player?

01:45.022 --> 01:46.690
Why,yes.

01:46.857 --> 01:48.358
You were a great
football player

01:48.483 --> 01:50.986
for the Oklahoma Sooners
in the late 1940s.

01:51.153 --> 01:52.654
I'll be doggone.

01:54.364 --> 01:55.407
I knew that.

01:57.409 --> 01:59.202
But you coached UT

01:59.328 --> 02:01.705
and won three
national championships.

02:02.706 --> 02:03.832
Yes.

02:04.416 --> 02:06.710
Texas had 30
All-American players

02:06.835 --> 02:08.544
while you were coaching.

02:09.378 --> 02:12.007
Which one had the
greatest impact on you

02:12.090 --> 02:13.425
and the program?

02:15.927 --> 02:17.554
Freddie.

02:20.891 --> 02:22.684
Freddie Steinmark.

02:23.060 --> 02:24.853
I'm sorry, Coach,

02:24.936 --> 02:28.732
but Freddie Steinmark
wasn't an All-American.

02:31.401 --> 02:32.611
No.

02:35.238 --> 02:37.783
But he was my
All-American.

02:39.242 --> 02:40.243
You see,

02:40.911 --> 02:43.914
a player's skills
and character

02:44.081 --> 02:47.084
are influenced years
before I ever meet him.

02:48.460 --> 02:50.837
I gain the benefit from
all the other coaches

02:50.921 --> 02:53.715
who instilled fight
and grit in their hearts.

Riders' creed,

(19605 MUSIC PLAYING)

03:03.767 --> 03:06.436
What's most important
is courage.

03:07.396 --> 03:09.773
It's not a disgrace
to be beaten.

03:09.898 --> 03:14.319
The greatest disgrace is
to quit or to turn yellow.

03:15.487 --> 03:16.738
You got that?

03:16.822 --> 03:18.198
ALL: Yes, sir.
Let me hear it again.

03:18.281 --> 03:19.366
Yes, sir!

there and practice hard.

(SIGHS)

03:28.792 --> 03:30.377
You did good last game.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.421
You scored a lot
of touchdowns.

03:32.587 --> 03:35.257
But you would have done better
if you'd run in a straight line.

03:35.424 --> 03:36.967
You get to the
end zone quicker.

03:37.426 --> 03:38.802
You zigzag too much.

03:38.969 --> 03:40.637
My dad taught me
to run that way.

03:45.142 --> 03:46.560
When you play for
your father's team

03:46.643 --> 03:49.479
on Tuesdays and Fridays,
you can zigzag.

03:49.646 --> 03:51.773
On Mondays and Saturdays,
you run a straight line.

03:52.149 --> 03:53.942
You got that?
Yes, sir!

03:54.109 --> 03:55.277

finish the whole thing for me. Okay?

04:07.289 --> 04:08.331
If you're gonna
be a great player,

04:08.457 --> 04:10.834
you gotta get some meat
on those little bones.

04:11.460 --> 04:13.378
How did my boy do
at practice today?

04:13.545 --> 04:14.963
I scored five touchdowns.

04:15.505 --> 04:16.505
Six.

04:16.839 --> 04:17.966
Our guy's gotta work

04:18.048 --> 04:19.634
a little bit harder
out there on the field

04:19.718 --> 04:20.844
because he's always
the smallest one.

04:20.969 --> 04:22.053
Isn't that right?

04:22.179 --> 04:23.346
I try as hard as I can.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.390
What makes a winner

04:25.515 --> 04:26.975
is learning that they
can always try harder.

04:28.310 --> 04:29.603
Is that enough
Parmigiano?

Yes, Mama.

bit more. Hmm?

We gotta get you
to Notre Dame.

04:36.026 --> 04:39.196

and great football.

04:51.374 --> 04:53.919
Haven't beaten
Lakewood in 15 years.

04:54.085 --> 04:58.173

is you all are pathetic.

04:59.216 --> 05:01.384
But not for damn long.

05:01.551 --> 05:02.636
We will beat Lakewood,

05:02.719 --> 05:05.138
we will win the
conference championship,

05:05.222 --> 05:06.598
and we're not
stopping there.

on board with my plan

ordered for this team.

He's gonna be carrying the
rock a lot for us this season.

to mass every day,

you think it is?

All right, guys.

15:18.793 --> 15:20.962
We will not lose this game.

15:22.046 --> 15:24.340
This streak ends now.

15:24.841 --> 15:28.302
We have 57 seconds
to go 82 yards.

15:30.888 --> 15:32.181
Not a problem.

15:33.015 --> 15:35.017

What do I do?

15:45.528 --> 15:47.196
Just give the damn
ball to Freddie.

15:53.703 --> 15:56.706
Down. Set. Hut!

16:44.879 --> 16:46.172
Well done, young man.

16:46.255 --> 16:47.548
Good game.
Thank you, sir.

16:47.965 --> 16:49.133
Neverseen
anybody your size

16:49.258 --> 16:50.718
do as much damage
as you do out there.

16:50.801 --> 16:52.595
Thanks. You do a lot
of damage yourself.

16:52.720 --> 16:53.804
Wish I had your size.

16:53.930 --> 16:55.264
You'd be dangerous.

16:55.598 --> 16:56.766
Hey, you want a ride?

16:56.933 --> 16:57.934
Nah.

17:00.311 --> 17:02.104
Your dad's always
there, watching.

17:02.271 --> 17:03.773
Every practice,
every game.

17:04.232 --> 17:05.983
All my life.
(LAUGHS)

17:06.776 --> 17:08.069
Did he play when
he was younger?

17:08.236 --> 17:09.569
He was an amazing athlete,

17:09.654 --> 17:11.906
the best in every
sport he ever tried.

17:11.989 --> 17:13.074
If he hadn't gotten
in a car accident

17:13.156 --> 17:14.617
and banged up his knee,
he would have been

17:14.742 --> 17:17.286
a Major League Baseball
player for sure.

17:21.415 --> 17:22.833
So he's like one
of those dads

17:22.959 --> 17:24.919
living his failed
dreams through you.

17:27.255 --> 17:29.090
He just wants me to
give everything I have

17:29.173 --> 17:31.217
in whatever I do,
all the time.

17:32.009 --> 17:34.470
School, sports. It's
all the same to him.

17:37.932 --> 17:40.017
I've seen a lot
of dads like that.

17:41.269 --> 17:44.272
What matters to us both is
for me to get a scholarship.

17:44.438 --> 17:46.023
We don't have a lot
of money for tuition.

17:46.190 --> 17:48.609
I'm sure you're gonna
get plenty of offers.

17:49.944 --> 17:51.779
So far, nothing.

17:52.822 --> 17:54.657
I bet you don't
have that problem.

17:57.994 --> 18:00.371
So many, I don't know
what to do with them all.

18:00.538 --> 18:02.248
Must be nice.

18:05.793 --> 18:08.379
Hey, you ever hear of Army's
two great running backs,

18:08.504 --> 18:10.506
Doc Blanchard
and Glenn Davis?

18:10.673 --> 18:13.342
They were called Mr. Inside and Mr.
Outside.

18:14.844 --> 18:16.345
That's us.

18:22.893 --> 18:24.020
Sounds good,
Mr. Outside.

18:24.186 --> 18:25.688
Okay, Mr. Inside.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.401
Hey, one more thing.

18:32.361 --> 18:35.406
Lakewood used to be the
number one team in the state.

18:36.324 --> 18:37.533
You know we're not
gonna lose a game

18:37.658 --> 18:39.076
for the rest of the year.

18:42.371 --> 18:43.539
Sounds good.

18:50.046 --> 18:52.548
FRED: I appreciate you taking
my call, Coach Crowder.

18:52.715 --> 18:55.217
Just wanted to make sure
you got my letters.

18:56.886 --> 18:59.096
Well, I will tell him you said that, sir.
Thank you.

19:00.431 --> 19:01.557
(FRED LAUGHS)

19:01.682 --> 19:03.434
Tell him he's also
a 4.0 student.

19:06.187 --> 19:08.689
165, with room
to put on more.

19:09.565 --> 19:11.567
Well, I assure you, sir.

19:14.070 --> 19:15.946
He weighs more
than 145 pounds.

19:19.742 --> 19:21.077
A junior college.

19:22.578 --> 19:23.579
Well, thank you anyway.

19:29.418 --> 19:30.544
Who's next?

19:30.628 --> 19:32.546
The Air Force. They
recruit smaller players.

19:32.630 --> 19:34.256
I have to study.

20:14.588 --> 20:15.631
You wanted to
see me, Coach?

20:16.424 --> 20:18.884
The University of Texas.

20:20.094 --> 20:21.429
What about it?

20:21.929 --> 20:23.848
Mike Campbell, their
defensive coordinator,

20:23.931 --> 20:26.225
is somebody who
trusts my word.

20:27.143 --> 20:29.270
And he thinks a little
different than most coaches.

20:29.437 --> 20:33.441
University of Texas? Me?

20:33.607 --> 20:35.401
No guarantees, of course.

20:36.694 --> 20:38.279
Did they show
any interest?

20:38.446 --> 20:40.906
Well, he came up yesterday
to recruit Bobby.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.492
Oh, well, that's why.
(SCOFFS)

20:43.659 --> 20:45.453
Hold on now.

20:45.619 --> 20:48.664
I made Iron Mike watch
a season worth of film.

20:49.331 --> 20:50.750
You got his attention.

20:51.667 --> 20:54.837
Okay. What do I do now?

20:54.920 --> 20:55.921
They want you and Bobby

20:56.046 --> 20:58.549
to fly to Austin this weekend
to meet Coach Royal.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.345
You need to sit down, son?

21:04.388 --> 21:06.390
No, I have to go.
I have to tell my dad.

21:06.557 --> 21:07.975
Now, wait.

21:08.142 --> 21:10.102
I'd be careful about
getting hopes up.

21:10.686 --> 21:13.814
They meet with a lot of kids
without making them an offer.

21:14.607 --> 21:15.608
Right.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.444
It means a lot they
want to see me.

21:19.320 --> 21:20.613
Thanks, Coach.

21:22.573 --> 21:24.742
University of Texas.

21:43.260 --> 21:45.179
Doesn't look real.

21:45.346 --> 21:48.265
Been a lot of great football
played here over the years.

21:49.058 --> 21:51.185
Never thought
I'd see this place.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.229
If I have anything
to do with it,

21:53.312 --> 21:54.897
you'll be playing here.

21:55.898 --> 21:59.485
But it's not up to me.
You ready to go meet him?

21:59.652 --> 22:00.945
Yes, sir.

22:02.863 --> 22:04.031
All right.

22:30.558 --> 22:32.309
Freddie Steinmark.

22:34.937 --> 22:36.564
Yes, Coach, that's me.

22:38.858 --> 22:41.151
Watched film on you
again this morning.

22:42.361 --> 22:45.531
You run like you got a school
of minnows in your pants.

22:46.615 --> 22:48.033
Thanks.

22:49.827 --> 22:51.996
I like the way
you attack.

22:53.080 --> 22:54.206
I try to teach my kids

22:54.290 --> 22:56.166
to drive through
the ball carrier.

22:56.250 --> 22:57.585
Notjust lay him
on the ground.

22:57.668 --> 22:59.378
Looks like that just
comes natural to you.

23:02.840 --> 23:07.553
I'm thinking about you
playing some safety

23:08.637 --> 23:10.347
and maybe returning punts.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.183
How's that sound to you?

23:18.522 --> 23:20.900
Maybe you need
some time to decide.

23:21.942 --> 23:23.068
Um...

23:23.444 --> 23:25.279
No. No, sir.

23:26.947 --> 23:29.199
What is it, son?

23:30.618 --> 23:31.911
Well, every other
coach just thought

23:31.994 --> 23:33.996
I was too small to play.

23:34.079 --> 23:35.122
ROYAL: (CHUCKLING) Too small.

23:37.541 --> 23:39.251
Well, I'm 5'10".

23:39.418 --> 23:41.545
I was an okay
college football player.

23:41.712 --> 23:43.255
Okay? (LAUGHS)

23:44.298 --> 23:46.550
He quarterbacked the
University of Oklahoma

23:46.634 --> 23:49.094
to an undefeated
season in 1949.

23:49.261 --> 23:50.721
ROYAL: Mike.

23:51.805 --> 23:53.974
You want me to
play here for you?

23:54.683 --> 23:56.977
Son, I'm offering you
a scholarship

23:57.144 --> 24:00.314
to attend the University
of Texas and play football.

24:00.481 --> 24:02.483
How can I be more plain?

24:08.113 --> 24:10.366
You will not regret
giving me the chance, sir.

24:10.532 --> 24:12.576
Becoming a Longhorn
and part of this football team

24:12.660 --> 24:14.078
is a dream come true.

24:14.244 --> 24:15.829
Give me my hand
back now, son.

24:15.996 --> 24:17.164
Sorry.

24:19.875 --> 24:21.752
As for you.

24:23.462 --> 24:24.546

24:25.005 --> 24:28.384

boys can be roommates.

24:29.927 --> 24:31.762
Yes, sir. Thank you.

24:31.929 --> 24:34.682
All right. That's
all for today,boys.

24:34.848 --> 24:37.309
We'll be seeing you back here
in two months. All right?

Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

25:11.260 --> 25:13.804
I kind of wanted to
tell you in person.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.390
So, what happened?

I can't believe that place.

25:18.809 --> 25:21.270
Everything is bigger
and better in Texas.

25:21.812 --> 25:23.272
And that means?

He offered me
a full scholarship.

01:06:00.999 --> 01:06:03.751
<i>it's Arkansas 7,
Texas nothing.</i>

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:05.462
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:07.547
RANDY: I'm wide open
after every five yards.

01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:11.759
Hey, slick. I can get open
out there. I promise.

01:06:11.843 --> 01:06:13.261
All right. Well,
if your number's called

01:06:13.344 --> 01:06:14.762
and you're open,
I'll get you the ball.

01:06:19.434 --> 01:06:21.102
You going to
be all right?

01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:23.521
One more half.

01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:25.773
CAMPBELL: Listen up!

01:06:26.774 --> 01:06:28.067
Everybody UP-

01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:36.784
I'm not gonna stand
here and tell you

01:06:36.868 --> 01:06:38.161
what you're doing wrong,
what you're doing right.

01:06:38.244 --> 01:06:40.830
By God, you wouldn't be playing
if you didn't know that.

01:06:44.083 --> 01:06:45.668
Men, I want you to think about

01:06:45.752 --> 01:06:48.505
all the years
we spent together.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.342
The practices.

01:06:53.468 --> 01:06:55.053
The weight room.

01:06:56.304 --> 01:06:57.639
The heat.

01:06:57.722 --> 01:06:59.057
The sweat.

01:06:59.641 --> 01:07:00.934
The vomit.

01:07:02.227 --> 01:07:03.895
The Medina drills.

01:07:04.854 --> 01:07:08.107
So difficult, every one of you
at some point wanted to quit.

01:07:12.153 --> 01:07:13.530
As you see,

01:07:15.365 --> 01:07:17.367
it was all for a purpose.

01:07:19.744 --> 01:07:21.329
To get ourselves

01:07:24.165 --> 01:07:25.667
to this place,

01:07:27.919 --> 01:07:29.754
for this great battle.

01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:32.632
Don't let all those hours

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:35.343
you put into this
endeavor go to waste.

01:07:41.391 --> 01:07:43.059
In about one hour,

01:07:44.477 --> 01:07:46.980
a gun is going to go
off and end the game.

01:07:47.855 --> 01:07:49.440
And at that point,

01:07:51.067 --> 01:07:52.777
the world will know

01:07:53.486 --> 01:07:56.239
that the 1969
National Champions

01:07:57.532 --> 01:08:00.076
were the University
of Texas Longhorns.

01:08:00.159 --> 01:08:01.369
FREDDIE: That's right.

01:08:01.828 --> 01:08:03.454
Now give me three.

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:05.456
TOM: Come on, let's go!
(PLAYERS CHATTERING)

01:08:06.874 --> 01:08:08.209
What you say, DOYS?

01:08:08.334 --> 01:08:10.128
All right. One by one, let's go.

01:08:10.211 --> 01:08:11.879
Play by play, let's 9°-

01:08:11.963 --> 01:08:14.132
Hey, let's go get them,
Fast Freddie.

01:08:14.257 --> 01:08:17.135
<i>PHIL: They've spotted the ball
inside the Texas 30-yard line.</i>

01:08:17.218 --> 01:08:18.553
<i>So that was a pickup of two</i>

01:08:18.636 --> 01:08:19.845
<i>on that last
running play, Joe.</i>

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:21.139
<i>JOE: And it's Arkansas.</i>

01:08:21.221 --> 01:08:23.765
<i>Second down and eight
on the Texas 29.</i>

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:26.477
<i>Dicus and Rees
split through the left.</i>

01:08:26.769 --> 01:08:28.770
<i>Montgomery, back to pass.</i>

01:08:29.564 --> 01:08:32.399
<i>And he hits Dicus
on a crossing pattern.</i>

01:08:32.483 --> 01:08:34.109
<i>He's got some running room.</i>

01:08:34.193 --> 01:08:36.362
<i>He's on the ten, five.</i>

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:37.904
<i>Arkansas, touchdown!</i>

01:08:38.031 --> 01:08:40.825
<i>The Razorbacks strike
first in the second half.</i>

01:08:40.908 --> 01:08:42.535
<i>PHIL: Steinmark had
a <i>shot at him,</i></i>

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:44.621
<i>but he couldn't
get there in time.</i>

01:08:44.996 --> 01:08:46.247
Freddie's a step behind.

01:08:46.331 --> 01:08:48.332
PHIL: <i>A demoralizing score
for the Longhorns,</i>

01:08:48.416 --> 01:08:50.501
<i>who are now down
14 to nothing.</i>

01:08:50.585 --> 01:08:52.962
Hey! It's your time, slick.

01:08:53.046 --> 01:08:54.296
BELLARD: Let's go, Texas.

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:55.881
Just watch me.

01:08:56.131 --> 01:08:59.135
<i>JOE: Second and nine
for Texas on the Arkansas 44.</i>

01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:01.554
<i>Street goes back.
He's in trouble.</i>

01:09:01.638 --> 01:09:04.432
<i>He breaks free.
He almost goes down.</i>

01:09:04.599 --> 01:09:06.142
<i>And there he goes.</i>

01:09:06.225 --> 01:09:09.145
<i>He's at the 30, the 20, 10.</i>

01:09:09.770 --> 01:09:12.607
<i>Touchdown, James Street.
What a run!</i>

01:09:13.191 --> 01:09:15.443
<i>PHIL: You can't hold
a <i>good man down, Joe.</i></i>

01:09:15.526 --> 01:09:17.444
<i>We've been seeing
that scrambling artistry</i>

01:09:17.528 --> 01:09:19.781
<i>from James Street
for the last two years.</i>

01:09:19.863 --> 01:09:22.033
<i>And now we can pull
within seven.</i>

01:09:23.158 --> 01:09:24.243
<i>JOE: Wait a minute, Phil.</i>

01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:27.246
<i>Look there. Texas is going
for the two-point conversion.</i>

01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:28.331
PHIL: <i>That's</i> a <i>big risk.</i>

01:09:28.413 --> 01:09:29.457
<i>If they fail, that makes it</i>

01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:31.334
a <i>two-possession game
instead of one.</i>

01:09:31.417 --> 01:09:34.127
<i>JOE: Coach Royal rolling
the dice on this one.</i>

01:09:34.212 --> 01:09:36.381
<i>It's Street, he fakes left.</i>

01:09:36.546 --> 01:09:38.675
<i>Spins, goes right.
And he's in there!</i>

01:09:38.758 --> 01:09:40.301
<i>Two points, Texas.</i>

01:09:40.385 --> 01:09:42.845
<i>Arkansas 14, Texas 8.</i>

<i>wins that bet.</i>

01:09:46.890 --> 01:09:48.850
<i>The number one team in
the land is back in the game.</i>

01:09:48.935 --> 01:09:50.603
Let's go, come on.

01:09:50.812 --> 01:09:53.523
<i>JOE: Montgomery goes back
and hits Dicus again!</i>

01:09:53.606 --> 01:09:55.650
<i>A 21-yard gain.</i>

01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:59.237
(GROANING SOFTLY)

01:10:11.999 --> 01:10:13.334
Down.

01:10:16.337 --> 01:10:18.047
Set! Hut!

01:10:25.763 --> 01:10:27.890
<i>JOE: There's the throw.
And it's too long.</i>

01:10:27.974 --> 01:10:29.600
<i>But we have a flag.</i>

01:10:29.684 --> 01:10:30.935
PHIL: <i>There was</i> a <i>hold.</i>

01:10:31.018 --> 01:10:32.270
<i>Steinmark was
going to get beat,</i>

01:10:32.353 --> 01:10:34.480
<i>and he grabbed his jersey
to save a touchdown.</i>

01:10:34.564 --> 01:10:36.232
I've got holding, number 28.

01:10:36.357 --> 01:10:37.525
<i>PHIL: So, with that penalty,</i>

01:10:37.608 --> 01:10:38.901
<i>that's going to
be a 15-yarder.</i>

01:10:38.985 --> 01:10:41.195
<i>That's going to move it
all the way from the 24</i>

01:10:41.279 --> 01:10:43.865
<i>down inside the 10-yard
line to the 9, Joe.</i>

01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:46.075
<i>JOE: I've never seen
him do that before.</i>

01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:49.620
He's finished.
Take him out.

01:10:50.329 --> 01:10:51.706
Get in there.

Freddie!

01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:02.383
FREDDIE: You can do it, Rick.

01:11:02.467 --> 01:11:04.886
<i>JOE: Rick Nabors,
the backup safety is in.</i>

01:11:04.969 --> 01:11:07.054
PHIL: <i>Joe, I believe that's
the first time I can remember</i>

01:11:07.138 --> 01:11:09.515
<i>he's being pulled from the
game for not doing his job.</i>

01:11:10.016 --> 01:11:12.143
At least he
saved a touchdown.

01:11:14.395 --> 01:11:16.731
I'm sorry, son.
I hated to do it.

01:11:18.024 --> 01:11:19.567
The right call.

01:11:26.866 --> 01:11:28.576
Bring your kinnies!

01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:30.369
Come on, now.
Stiff it up!

01:11:30.536 --> 01:11:32.121
JAMES: Set! Hut!

01:11:33.247 --> 01:11:35.750
<i>JOE: Montgomery, looking
for Dicus. He throws it.</i>

<i>Danny Lester.</i>

01:11:38.795 --> 01:11:41.047
<i>He breaks the tackle
and returns it back</i>

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:42.882
<i>all the way to the 25.</i>

01:11:42.965 --> 01:11:44.383
<i>PHIL: That's a <i>big break
for the Longhorns.</i></i>

01:11:44.467 --> 01:11:45.510
<i>They dodged a bullet.</i>

01:11:45.593 --> 01:11:47.178
<i>Montgomery and Dicus
were on a roll.</i>

01:11:47.261 --> 01:11:48.596
Offense, on the field.

01:11:48.679 --> 01:11:50.014
<i>JOE: And here we go.
With six minutes to go,</i>

01:11:50.097 --> 01:11:51.933
<i>Texas needs to make
something happen.</i>

01:11:52.016 --> 01:11:53.601
<i>Time's running out.</i>

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:57.522
<i>And it's Street to Speyrer
on the end-around.</i>

01:11:57.605 --> 01:12:00.149
<i>He breaks it up field
to the 40, 45,</i>

01:12:00.233 --> 01:12:02.193
<i>into Arkansas territory.</i>

01:12:05.112 --> 01:12:06.405
Set! Hut!

01:12:08.074 --> 01:12:09.992
<i>JOE: Koy, with a quick
hit to the inside.</i>

01:12:10.076 --> 01:12:11.577
<i>A gain of a couple.</i>

01:12:11.661 --> 01:12:14.997
<i>Worster again, off tackle.
Maybe three yards at the most.</i>

01:12:15.164 --> 01:12:18.417
<i>Third and five. Worster again.
They didn't make it.</i>

01:12:18.584 --> 01:12:19.585
<i>PHIL: Now it's fourth down</i>

01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:20.670
<i>and the clock is
still running, Joe.</i>

01:12:20.753 --> 01:12:22.004
Damn it.

Ref!

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:26.509
<i>JOE: Time out, Texas. Fourth
at about two and a half.</i>

01:12:26.676 --> 01:12:29.011
<i>PHIL: Oh, this is going
to be Coach Royal's</i>

01:12:29.095 --> 01:12:31.138
<i>biggest call of the game,
if not the season.</i>

01:12:31.222 --> 01:12:32.473
<i>JOE: No doubt.</i>

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:34.183
That veer should be there.

01:12:34.267 --> 01:12:35.351
Fourth and two and a half.

01:12:35.434 --> 01:12:36.435
Fourth and two and a half.

01:12:36.519 --> 01:12:38.104
But with this field
position, if we go for this

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:39.522
and don't make it,
and give it back to them,

01:12:39.605 --> 01:12:40.773
that's it, game's over.

01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:42.650
We got four
minutes left.

Right 53 veer pass.

01:12:54.412 --> 01:12:57.373
Hey, Coach! Right 53
veer pass. You sure?

01:12:57.748 --> 01:12:59.625
Hell yes, I'm sure.
Run the play.

01:13:00.585 --> 01:13:01.878
Yes, sir.

01:13:05.882 --> 01:13:08.843
Yeah, I might be wrong,
but I'm not confused.

01:13:11.178 --> 01:13:12.889

01:13:14.098 --> 01:13:15.933

Right 53 veer pass. On one.

01:13:21.022 --> 01:13:22.273
You better be open.

01:27:00.507 --> 01:27:03.009
Whatever you're going
through, I'm going through.

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:05.971
I know.

01:27:07.973 --> 01:27:09.516
I'm sorry.
No.

01:27:11.685 --> 01:27:13.270
It's gonna be okay.

01:27:17.774 --> 01:27:20.527
(SNIFFLING) Your
parents are flying in.

01:27:21.194 --> 01:27:23.029
I'm picking them up
in a couple of hours.

01:27:24.406 --> 01:27:25.615
Thanks.

01:27:32.539 --> 01:27:33.749
I'll be outside.

01:27:33.832 --> 01:27:35.542
Love you.
I love you.

01:27:37.461 --> 01:27:39.045
How are you, Linda?

01:27:43.216 --> 01:27:44.217
Coach.

01:27:44.509 --> 01:27:45.635
I thought you were
in New York.

01:27:45.719 --> 01:27:48.221
Ah, hell, I never liked
those big cities.

01:27:49.389 --> 01:27:51.516
If Coach is here,
it must be serious.

01:27:52.642 --> 01:27:54.770
DR. MARTIN: Well, Freddie, I'm
going to lay it out to you,

01:27:54.853 --> 01:27:56.480
as simple as possible.

01:27:56.813 --> 01:27:59.149
We're going to
biopsy your tumor.

01:27:59.524 --> 01:28:02.152
Best scenario is that it's
benign, we can drain it,

01:28:02.235 --> 01:28:04.321
and you'll be out
of here in no time.

01:28:04.404 --> 01:28:06.239
But the chance
of that happening,

01:28:06.323 --> 01:28:09.493
based on my reading of the
X-ray, is quite small.

01:28:11.703 --> 01:28:14.790
It's most likely an
osteogenic sarcoma.

01:28:16.082 --> 01:28:17.334
Bone cancer.

01:28:21.546 --> 01:28:22.881
If that's the case,

01:28:23.757 --> 01:28:26.384
I'm going to have to
amputate your leg.

01:28:28.595 --> 01:28:30.555
We have no other choice.

01:28:33.058 --> 01:28:34.184
Okay.

01:28:37.938 --> 01:28:39.314
How far up?

01:28:40.190 --> 01:28:41.650
DR. MARTINI The hip.

01:28:47.322 --> 01:28:48.448
Okay.

01:28:54.246 --> 01:28:55.747
We'll see you first
thing in the morning.

01:28:55.831 --> 01:28:56.957
Yeah.

01:28:57.415 --> 01:28:58.834
Thanks,Doc.

01:29:02.128 --> 01:29:03.588
Thank you, Doctor.

01:29:12.264 --> 01:29:13.598
(EXHALES)

01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:20.146
Freddie, you and I
have been through

01:29:20.230 --> 01:29:22.065
some tough spots together.

01:29:24.234 --> 01:29:25.777
Both of us have

01:29:26.945 --> 01:29:27.946
been behind in life,

01:29:28.029 --> 01:29:30.073
and we've come back.
We've never given up.

01:29:33.201 --> 01:29:35.036
You can't give up now.

01:29:38.999 --> 01:29:40.417
Okay, Coach.

01:29:41.042 --> 01:29:42.544
Whatever it is,

01:29:43.795 --> 01:29:45.922
you will meet the challenge.

01:29:49.509 --> 01:29:51.261
And I'll be here for you.

01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:53.889
(BREATHING SHAKILY)

01:29:55.390 --> 01:29:56.516
Yeah.

01:29:58.560 --> 01:29:59.895
Thank you.

01:30:03.523 --> 01:30:04.524
Freddie, don't get up.

01:30:04.608 --> 01:30:06.026
Let me do it now.

01:30:06.568 --> 01:30:07.611
(GRUNTS)

01:30:07.694 --> 01:30:09.905
I may not get another chance.

(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

01:30:23.376 --> 01:30:25.629
You know why we're
having this meeting?

01:30:25.712 --> 01:30:27.172
I think it's about Freddie.

01:30:27.339 --> 01:30:29.049
Has anybody heard anything?

01:30:29.132 --> 01:30:31.134
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)

01:30:35.889 --> 01:30:37.724
ROYAL: Sit down. Sit down.

01:30:37.807 --> 01:30:39.351
Everybody sit down.

01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:50.070
As you're all aware,
Freddie's surgery was today.

01:30:51.988 --> 01:30:53.406
I want you all to
know the outcome

01:30:53.490 --> 01:30:55.742
before you heard it
from somewhere else.

01:31:01.456 --> 01:31:03.667
They found a cancerous tumor,

01:31:05.085 --> 01:31:07.504
the size of a baseball,
on his femur.

01:31:09.798 --> 01:31:10.882
Doctors told me
they didn't know

01:31:10.966 --> 01:31:12.467
how he could
walk on that leg,

01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:14.511
much less play football.

01:31:16.388 --> 01:31:17.389
Of course, I'm sure

01:31:17.472 --> 01:31:19.599
that wouldn't surprise
anybody here.

01:31:24.145 --> 01:31:26.064
They amputated his leg...

01:31:26.398 --> 01:31:28.191
Damn.
...at the hip.

01:31:34.906 --> 01:31:37.951
Men, your teammate is in
the fight of his life.

01:31:40.578 --> 01:31:42.789
And if there's anybody I know,

01:31:43.748 --> 01:31:46.167
or have ever known,
who's up to it,

01:31:47.544 --> 01:31:49.629
it's Freddie Joe Steinmark.

01:31:51.381 --> 01:31:53.717
That boy has never backed down
against nothing or nobody,

01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:55.010
and he won't now.

01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:01.433
But he's gonna
need all of you.

01:32:02.767 --> 01:32:04.269
Your thoughts,

01:32:05.103 --> 01:32:06.563
VOW prayers,

01:32:07.522 --> 01:32:08.982
Your support.

01:32:12.402 --> 01:32:13.778
Hey, Coach.

01:32:14.696 --> 01:32:16.281
Are they gonna let him
out of the hospital

01:32:16.364 --> 01:32:19.534
to come and be with all
of us at the Cotton Bowl?

01:32:20.243 --> 01:32:21.786
I'm afraid not.

01:32:22.704 --> 01:32:25.915
Doctor said a minimum 3O
days before he can leave.

01:32:28.543 --> 01:32:31.421
But, men, he will be
there with us in spirit.

01:32:35.216 --> 01:32:37.218
He will be there with us.

01:32:43.558 --> 01:32:44.851

I'll never play again.

01:33:03.328 --> 01:33:04.954
I won't be able
to show Notre Dame

01:33:05.038 --> 01:33:07.123
what they missed out on.

01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:10.210
None of that matters now.

01:33:16.508 --> 01:33:17.884
Look at me.

01:33:19.844 --> 01:33:22.430
There is nothing
my boy can't do.

01:33:23.765 --> 01:33:25.475
You will beat this.

01:33:26.935 --> 01:33:28.728
We'll do it together.

01:33:30.438 --> 01:33:31.648
(SWALLOWS)

01:33:32.774 --> 01:33:34.150

When you get out
of the hospital,

we're gonna go to our
favorite parking spot.

01:34:21.865 --> 01:34:23.616
That may be a while.

01:34:24.325 --> 01:34:26.411
They said at least a month.

01:34:26.661 --> 01:34:28.705
I've got nothing but time.

01:34:36.129 --> 01:34:38.965
We're gonna get back to our
normal lives. I promise.

01:34:39.048 --> 01:34:41.301
Normal? (SCOFFS)
Yes, normal.

where you're
gonna be coaching.

01:35:21.466 --> 01:35:24.093
And there's our
little house in Aurora,

01:35:25.178 --> 01:35:27.847
where we're gonna live
with our one girl

01:35:27.931 --> 01:35:29.474

What are those for?

01:36:16.938 --> 01:36:18.356
Oh, Freddie.

01:36:18.898 --> 01:36:20.900
He's gonna be with us
at the Cotton Bowl.

01:36:20.984 --> 01:36:22.986
(CHUCKLES) Not on
those, he's not.

FREDDIE: Please, Doctor.

01:36:24.779 --> 01:36:26.072
No, I'm sorry, Freddie.

01:36:26.155 --> 01:36:28.116
It's out of the question.
Uh, you know...

01:36:28.199 --> 01:36:31.160
Only way we could let you
go is in a wheelchair.

01:36:31.327 --> 01:36:32.912
Even that's doubtful.

01:36:34.706 --> 01:36:37.000
You just had a major
traumatic surgery.

01:36:37.083 --> 01:36:38.710
I won't go in
a wheelchair.

01:36:38.876 --> 01:36:40.545
Then you're not
leaving the hospital.

01:36:40.628 --> 01:36:42.005
Can't you just let me
try the crutches?

01:36:42.088 --> 01:36:43.089
No.

01:36:43.172 --> 01:36:45.466
Your system will be
in recovery for weeks.

01:36:45.633 --> 01:36:47.218
Just being upright puts
too much pressure

01:36:47.302 --> 01:36:48.303
on all your stitches.

01:36:48.469 --> 01:36:49.971
I'd just like to try.

01:36:50.138 --> 01:36:52.640
I'm sorry, Freddie, this
is not up for discussion.

01:36:53.808 --> 01:36:55.852
I'll be back to check
on you tomorrow.

01:36:56.185 --> 01:36:57.228

such a good idea.

and he's not there.
ls there something wrong?

01:37:56.788 --> 01:37:58.498
Yes, there sure is.

01:37:58.623 --> 01:38:00.291
We can hardly
keep track of him.

He's constantly
on the move.

01:38:06.589 --> 01:38:09.217
Those two practice
every day for hours.

01:38:12.804 --> 01:38:15.473
I know some doctors
do not support this,

01:38:16.933 --> 01:38:18.851
but I think it's great.

01:38:22.563 --> 01:38:23.731
There it is.

01:38:28.444 --> 01:38:29.612

01:38:29.695 --> 01:38:31.072
Absolutely.

All right, end
of this hallway,

01:38:35.952 --> 01:38:38.329
then I'll get a break.
(GRUNTING) Okay.

01:38:39.038 --> 01:38:41.082

DR. MARTIN: There's
a rumor going around

01:38:55.596 --> 01:38:57.265
that you've gone
renegade on me.

01:38:57.348 --> 01:38:59.517
FREDDIE: I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:38:59.684 --> 01:39:01.310
Well, this isn't
the military,

01:39:01.394 --> 01:39:04.021
and I can't order you
off the crutches.

01:39:04.647 --> 01:39:07.233
I can only strongly
advise against it.

01:39:09.485 --> 01:39:10.862
Dr. Martin.

01:39:17.034 --> 01:39:18.828
How many patients of
yours have lost limbs

01:39:18.911 --> 01:39:20.329
due to bone cancer?

01:39:23.291 --> 01:39:24.876
Well, I don't have
the statistics.

01:39:24.959 --> 01:39:26.002
There are many variances.

01:39:26.085 --> 01:39:28.504
Please. I wanna
know where I stand.

01:39:29.338 --> 01:39:31.382
I read an article
on how bone cancer

01:39:31.466 --> 01:39:33.426
is one of the deadliest.

01:39:33.509 --> 01:39:35.094
Hardest to cure.

01:39:35.595 --> 01:39:37.597
Well, that's true, it is.

of success stories.

be straight with me.

one more time,

01:39:57.533 --> 01:40:00.286
and I'm begging you
to tell me the truth.
