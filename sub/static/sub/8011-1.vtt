02:13.083 --> 02:16.000
"Welcome Back."

02:16.500 --> 02:20.000
"Welcome Back."

02:35.375 --> 02:41.791
"Welcome Back."

02:42.291 --> 02:45.791
"Welcome Back."

04:16.958 --> 04:19.041
"Welcome...."

04:19.541 --> 04:21.583
"Welcome."

04:22.083 --> 04:24.375
"Welcome...Welcome...Welcome."

04:24.875 --> 04:25.791
"Everybody let's Welcome back."

04:26.291 --> 04:28.458
"Everybody let's have some fun."

04:28.958 --> 04:30.791
"Everybody let's Welcome back."

04:31.291 --> 04:33.166
I'm sure you recognized them.

04:33.666 --> 04:35.541
"Go explain him... who Uday Shetty really is."

04:36.041 --> 04:36.833
"What his true colors are?"

04:37.791 --> 04:39.708
"And the things he can do if he blows his cool."

04:40.208 --> 04:41.375
"I do have a gun."

04:41.875 --> 04:43.375
I'll blast few rounds under his ear lobes..

04:43.875 --> 04:48.083
..that he'll be dancing before the horse himself.

04:48.583 --> 04:50.291
'You guessed it right.'

04:50.791 --> 04:53.458
'They are underworld Dons Uday Shetty and Majnu bhai.'

04:53.958 --> 04:57.541
'There was a time when they ruled this city.'

04:58.041 --> 04:58.666
'But look at them now.'

04:59.166 --> 05:01.125
'They are getting swindled out of their own money.'

05:01.625 --> 05:02.000
'Why?'

05:02.500 --> 05:05.875
'Because these yesteryear goons... have turned white-collared now.'

05:06.375 --> 05:11.208
Uday! - I don't get it at all.

05:11.708 --> 05:13.125
Where's the money?

05:13.625 --> 05:16.125
Who let you in here?

05:16.625 --> 05:20.875
Snake, water and Basha Khan can get in anywhere.

05:21.375 --> 05:23.125
So which one are you?

05:23.625 --> 05:25.083
Do I look like a snake or water?

05:25.583 --> 05:26.708
I am Basha Khan.

05:27.208 --> 05:29.125
I own everything that moves in Dubai.

05:29.625 --> 05:34.875
And you two are running such a big hotel.

05:35.375 --> 05:37.208
Did you load the guns in your mind, boss?

05:37.708 --> 05:41.250
Yes. - Don't fire them.

05:41.750 --> 05:43.833
So...will you pay up or do I raze down this hotel?

05:44.333 --> 05:47.916
Bloody...walking balloon. You'll raze down my hotel?

05:48.416 --> 05:49.750
Yes!

05:50.250 --> 05:53.666
Control, Majnu...Control!

05:54.166 --> 05:55.416
What control?

05:55.916 --> 05:58.166
Now these toads are croaking at us.

05:58.666 --> 06:00.708
Majnu, we've been blessed with everything.

06:01.208 --> 06:04.041
Fame, Fortune...Respect.

06:04.541 --> 06:06.708
And respected men are helpless.

06:07.208 --> 06:08.000
They have to pay up.

06:08.500 --> 06:08.916
Mannu. - Yes, boss.

06:09.416 --> 06:10.083
Go quench his thirst.

06:10.583 --> 06:11.125
Yes, boss.

06:11.625 --> 06:11.916
Go.

06:12.416 --> 06:12.916
Come, Basha bhai.

06:13.416 --> 06:16.208
Uday...you're the smarter of the two, so explain him as well.

06:16.708 --> 06:18.958
My feet are down there...not here.

06:19.458 --> 06:21.291
What did you say? - Nothing...I don't remember.

06:21.791 --> 06:23.583
He's a mirror of our past. - What?

06:24.083 --> 06:24.541
Not you... Go on!

06:25.041 --> 06:27.333
Come, Basha sir. The sweets are this way.

06:27.833 --> 06:32.708
He's an ugly image of our past.

06:33.208 --> 06:35.666
This is exactly how we were.

06:36.166 --> 06:37.625
We would simply pickup the phone and..

06:38.125 --> 06:40.333
"Send 20 million... Send 40 million.."

06:40.833 --> 06:44.000
Doesn't it feel much better to lead a respectable life?

06:44.500 --> 06:45.166
You're right, boss.

06:45.666 --> 06:48.041
Since you turned descent, a lot of people respect you.

06:48.541 --> 06:48.791
Right, boss?

06:49.291 --> 06:50.375
But earlier everyone would respect him.

06:50.875 --> 06:51.416
Right, boss?

06:51.916 --> 06:53.541
That wasn't respect, it was fear.

06:54.041 --> 06:54.125
Right, boss.

06:54.625 --> 06:55.958
Fear is better than this decency.

06:56.458 --> 06:56.791
Right, boss.

06:57.291 --> 06:58.416
What's all this?

06:58.916 --> 07:02.458
Can't you all stick to one thing?

07:02.958 --> 07:04.958
Why are you confusing me?

07:05.458 --> 07:07.708
They can't confuse you.

07:08.208 --> 07:10.833
You've been confused for the last seven years yourself..

07:11.333 --> 07:14.625
..whether you did the right thing by turning decent.

07:15.125 --> 07:17.125
Right...we are confused.

07:17.625 --> 07:19.625
Not us...only you.

07:20.125 --> 07:23.083
I am clear...that I am wrong.

07:23.583 --> 07:26.375
I am still within my limits because of your decency.

07:26.875 --> 07:29.291
Otherwise...I would've made my own Al-Qaidas.

07:29.791 --> 07:31.416
"There's another problem in their life."

07:31.916 --> 07:34.125
"These two poor guys are still unmarried."

07:34.625 --> 07:36.958
"They couldn't get married yet."

07:37.458 --> 07:38.041
There's not a single female in their home.

07:38.541 --> 07:41.458
Boss, if there's nothing more to do, can we go home?

07:41.958 --> 07:43.500
You never stay when there is something to do.

07:44.000 --> 07:44.875
Go. - Thanks.

07:45.375 --> 07:46.625
No need to go anywhere.

07:47.125 --> 07:48.416
Boss, it's 'Karvachauth' today.

07:48.916 --> 07:51.458
Our poor wives must be waiting for us.

07:51.958 --> 07:57.125
How would these two poor guys know about wives, 'Karvachauth'..

07:57.625 --> 07:59.416
..Home or Children.

07:59.916 --> 08:01.208
Love you, son..

08:01.708 --> 08:04.000
I'll get you the chocolate...I promise.

08:04.500 --> 08:06.625
Even the toys. I'll get everything.

08:07.125 --> 08:09.041
Boss, the children are giving you love.

08:09.541 --> 08:10.666
Boss, we'll have to go.

08:11.166 --> 08:11.666
Yes, we have to.

08:12.166 --> 08:12.541
Let's go.

08:13.041 --> 08:15.083
They are all married.

08:15.583 --> 08:16.791
Look at this fatso.

08:17.291 --> 08:18.916
When he's sitting, he looks like a big sofa.

08:19.416 --> 08:21.416
And this baldy.

08:21.916 --> 08:24.375
His wife doesn't have to wait for the moon to rise.

08:24.875 --> 08:28.458
Even I've a big desire..

08:28.958 --> 08:32.166
..that someone looks at me from the other side of the strainer.

08:32.666 --> 08:33.500
Yes, that's true.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.625
But wives are a peculiar puzzle.

08:37.125 --> 08:39.082
They trouble their husband all year and make his life hell.

08:39.582 --> 08:41.457
And by performing such rituals...they don't let them die either.

08:41.957 --> 08:44.125
Regardless...we should get married.

08:44.625 --> 08:45.541
Yes, of course we should.

08:46.041 --> 08:49.291
But you see...our good-looks interfere with our destiny.

08:49.791 --> 08:53.291
Lord must be confused...about the kind of girl He has to make for us.

09:17.750 --> 09:21.250
"But one day...Lord sent a dame in their life...clad in a two-piece."

09:29.083 --> 09:39.291
"And it was love at first sight, for these two...with the same gal."

09:39.791 --> 09:43.291
"But she is no ordinary girl."

09:48.000 --> 09:51.250
"She is Princess Chandni."

09:51.750 --> 09:55.083
And this is the website from where the princess was downloaded.

09:55.583 --> 09:58.083
"I mean her mom..."

09:58.583 --> 10:02.041
"Queen Padmavati" of Nazabgarh.

10:02.541 --> 10:07.958
"But do you know why they are here?"

10:08.458 --> 10:12.458
So...after we get out, we've to lure their kids.

10:12.958 --> 10:15.583
They are the targets.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.375
Look at his face...

10:17.875 --> 10:18.916
And this one isn't even worth a look.

10:19.416 --> 10:21.541
Mr. Gill's seen their hotels.

10:22.041 --> 10:23.958
They are filthily rich.

10:24.458 --> 10:27.833
This time we'll be posing as Queen and Princess.

10:28.333 --> 10:29.125
Why is that?

10:29.625 --> 10:32.125
The rich get credit easily.

10:32.625 --> 10:33.791
Sometimes we'll borrow from them...

10:34.291 --> 10:35.541
...other times they can give it as gifts.

10:36.041 --> 10:38.666
But what if they seriously come after me for marriage.

10:39.166 --> 10:42.833
I didn't get married yet, how can I let you do it?

10:43.333 --> 10:45.458
But...they look like tough nuts to crack.

10:45.958 --> 10:46.875
Can we break them?

10:47.375 --> 10:49.958
Not just break them dear, they will melt away.

10:50.458 --> 10:50.875
They will melt away.

10:51.375 --> 10:54.625
Both the rascals are eager to get married.

10:55.125 --> 10:57.250
And after all, you're my daughter.

10:57.750 --> 10:58.500
In just two meetings...

10:59.000 --> 11:02.500
...you'll turn them into Ranbir Kapoor and Shahid Kapoor.

11:26.291 --> 11:27.833
"Tell me baby now..."

11:28.333 --> 11:29.916
"...what's the reason that you sound."

11:30.416 --> 11:32.583
"What's the reason that you sound like my dream guy."

11:33.083 --> 11:34.791
"And your ways just feels like wow!"

11:35.291 --> 11:38.750
"I feel relieved... every time you're close to me."

11:39.250 --> 11:42.916
"Every time you're close... my passion soars."

11:43.416 --> 11:46.708
"So why don't you meet me really soon."

11:47.208 --> 11:49.166
"Baby...meet me daily."

11:49.666 --> 11:51.250
"Life's so lonely."

11:51.750 --> 11:53.166
"Baby...meet me daily."

11:53.666 --> 11:55.541
"You've stolen my heart."

11:56.041 --> 11:57.666
"Baby...meet me daily."

11:58.166 --> 11:59.291
"Life's so lonely."

11:59.791 --> 12:01.458
"Baby...meet me daily."

12:01.958 --> 12:04.125
"You've stolen my heart."

12:04.625 --> 12:08.875
"O Baby... O Baby... O Baby..."

12:09.375 --> 12:11.000
Mom, I want this car.

12:11.500 --> 12:12.500
Such a beautiful car.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.500
That we can't afford.

12:21.125 --> 12:24.791
Love you

12:25.291 --> 12:27.125
"You stole my heart in a second."

12:27.625 --> 12:29.208
"Now you seem important than the rest."

12:29.708 --> 12:30.125
"Important than the rest..."

12:30.625 --> 12:31.250
"Important than the rest..."

12:31.750 --> 12:35.250
"Important than the rest..."

12:41.583 --> 12:43.416
"You stole my heart in a second."

12:43.916 --> 12:45.458
"Now you seem important than the rest."

12:45.958 --> 12:47.708
"You know how incomplete I am without you."

12:48.208 --> 12:51.375
"Distances are not good in love."

12:51.875 --> 12:55.583
"Why do you meet me only on weekends."

12:56.083 --> 12:57.833
"Baby...meet me daily."

12:58.333 --> 12:59.833
"Life's so lonely."

13:00.333 --> 13:02.041
"Baby...meet me daily."

13:02.541 --> 13:04.125
"You've stolen my heart."

13:04.625 --> 13:06.125
"Baby...meet me daily."

13:06.625 --> 13:08.041
"Life's so lonely."

13:08.541 --> 13:10.208
"Baby...meet me daily."

13:10.708 --> 13:12.833
"You've stolen my heart."

13:13.333 --> 13:18.833
"O Baby... O Baby... O Baby..."

13:19.333 --> 13:24.416
Mom...I don't like a single ring here.

13:24.916 --> 13:26.416
How about this one? - "Baby...meet me daily."

13:26.916 --> 13:27.958
"Life's so lonely."

13:28.458 --> 13:30.125
Majnu, your heart is bigger than this ring.

13:30.625 --> 13:32.708
My love

13:33.208 --> 13:34.958
Brother.

13:35.458 --> 13:36.625
Brother.

13:37.125 --> 13:38.666
Why are you prancing around like a horse?

13:39.166 --> 13:39.833
I've wonderful news.

13:40.333 --> 13:43.041
What happened? - I've decided to get married.

13:43.541 --> 13:45.708
Congratulations...

13:46.208 --> 13:47.208
Me too. - What?

13:47.708 --> 13:48.958
With whom? - Yes...with the princess.

13:49.458 --> 13:51.000
Princess? - Hmmmm.

13:51.500 --> 13:53.250
But I love the princess.

13:53.750 --> 13:57.666
Ignorant fool...she loves me. - I see.

13:58.166 --> 14:02.000
Let's go ask her whom she loves. - Come on.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.416
Madam, both the ATMs are here.

14:04.916 --> 14:08.791
What? You love Uday and Majnu?

14:09.291 --> 14:11.000
Dear, we belong to the Nazabgarh aristocracy.

14:11.500 --> 14:15.458
And we don't fall in love so easily.

14:15.958 --> 14:18.500
And your heart's...beating for two?

14:19.000 --> 14:21.125
What else can I do, mom?

14:21.625 --> 14:23.750
Whenever I close my eyes I see Uday.

14:24.250 --> 14:25.833
And when I open them I see Majnu.

14:26.333 --> 14:30.625
And most importantly... Uday's such an experienced actor.

14:31.125 --> 14:35.333
"Potatoes...!"

14:35.833 --> 14:39.333
"Onions...!"

14:39.833 --> 14:44.833
And the other one... is a magnificent painter.

14:45.333 --> 14:50.958
"When I'm holding a brush, I don't hold a gun."

14:51.458 --> 14:53.625
So, mom...

14:54.125 --> 14:56.541
Can I marry them both?

14:57.041 --> 14:57.875
What?

14:58.375 --> 14:59.958
You're choosing a companion not buying a cooking-gas.

15:00.458 --> 15:02.041
More the merrier doesn't apply here.

15:02.541 --> 15:07.625
I feel...you should let them decide.

15:08.125 --> 15:14.000
Whosever horoscope matches the most...will marry you.

15:14.500 --> 15:17.833
Wow...what a decision.

15:18.333 --> 15:21.416
Priest.. - Yes.

15:21.916 --> 15:24.416
I hope my celestial merits are enough?

15:24.916 --> 15:28.250
Even if they're not, I'll take some from Majnu's horoscope.

15:28.750 --> 15:29.291
You do that.

15:29.791 --> 15:32.291
Otherwise...it won't take long for this scene to turn bloody.

15:32.791 --> 15:38.291
And I have the quality to do that.

15:38.791 --> 15:40.458
Do all my merits match with the princess?

15:40.958 --> 15:42.666
All 38

15:43.166 --> 15:44.291
But there are only 36,

15:44.791 --> 15:46.750
Yes. But seeing the way you cut that watermelon..

15:47.250 --> 15:48.166
..I was going to say 40.

15:48.666 --> 15:49.958
You fool, you stick to 36.

15:50.458 --> 15:50.958
And don't forget...

15:51.458 --> 15:55.750
Knives can take lives as well.

15:56.250 --> 16:01.041
Priest...look at the horoscopes...and stop dreaming.

16:01.541 --> 16:05.041
Uday!

16:07.208 --> 16:10.708
Father, Hello.

16:12.916 --> 16:15.791
You're angry with me, aren't you?

16:16.291 --> 16:17.750
What are you doing here?

16:18.250 --> 16:19.916
I hid something from you till now.

16:20.416 --> 16:21.958
You know that I got married twice.

16:22.458 --> 16:24.166
I'm a little tensed, just need to speak for a minute.

16:24.666 --> 16:28.500
Go ahead, we don't understand a thing anyway.

16:29.000 --> 16:29.541
Why did you grow a beard?

16:30.041 --> 16:31.208
You look cheap.

16:31.708 --> 16:32.875
Your hairstyles really nice.

16:33.375 --> 16:34.708
This is not some style, I lost most of my hair.

16:35.208 --> 16:35.625
Because of you.

16:36.125 --> 16:36.833
Is that so?

16:37.333 --> 16:38.625
I can understand, I'm going to lose some more hair.

16:39.125 --> 16:41.291
I mean I got married thrice an not twice.

16:41.791 --> 16:44.833
And I have another daughter, which means your sister.

16:45.333 --> 16:46.958
What...three marriages?

16:47.458 --> 16:49.041
Sister. I have no sister. Get lost.

16:49.541 --> 16:51.125
Uncle!

16:51.625 --> 16:53.791
What new problem did you cook-up now?

16:54.291 --> 16:57.458
Majnu, you know that I got married twice.

16:57.958 --> 17:00.041
But actually I got married thrice.

17:00.541 --> 17:01.625
Three?

17:02.125 --> 17:03.541
Children are crying out for food..

17:04.040 --> 17:05.290
..and father's finished his 3 course-meal.

17:05.790 --> 17:07.333
And I have a daughter.

17:07.833 --> 17:09.875
Daughter?

17:10.375 --> 17:11.833
You mean another sister. - Yes

17:12.333 --> 17:14.290
People normally get sc****

17:14.790 --> 17:16.250
But in this case your own father's sc**** you.

17:16.750 --> 17:18.540
Well...there's no guarantee of this father now.

17:19.040 --> 17:20.583
My life-switch can turn-off any minute.

17:21.083 --> 17:21.833
Are you my father or a ceiling fan?

17:22.333 --> 17:22.708
On-off?

17:23.208 --> 17:23.708
What's wrong with you?

17:24.208 --> 17:27.208
My motor's damaged... Heart.

17:27.708 --> 17:30.375
Just like you got Sanjana married in a decent family..

17:30.875 --> 17:33.750
..I want you to do the same with Ranjana.

17:34.250 --> 17:35.916
That's all I do.

17:36.416 --> 17:37.625
You keep getting yourselves a new wife every time.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.708
And we find grooms for our sisters.

17:40.208 --> 17:42.000
I don't have any sister.

17:42.500 --> 17:45.791
But I have a brother.

17:46.291 --> 17:49.041
I thought he'll be overjoyed to see me.

17:49.541 --> 17:50.625
Hug me..

17:51.125 --> 17:54.166
I didn't know he'll refuse to accept me.

17:54.666 --> 17:55.750
On every 'Raksha Bandhan'..

17:56.250 --> 18:00.833
..I would see my friend's brothers and wish that I had a brother too.

18:01.333 --> 18:02.625
But when I found out that I do..

18:03.125 --> 18:05.458
..I left my exams in-between to meet him.

18:05.958 --> 18:06.791
Now I've met him.

18:07.291 --> 18:09.958
I guess I'm not destined for any brotherly love.

18:10.458 --> 18:12.291
Why not?

18:12.791 --> 18:14.000
I am there.

18:14.500 --> 18:18.458
I always wished that... I had a sister.

18:18.958 --> 18:20.750
And I've found her today.

18:21.250 --> 18:22.750
You're my sister...not his.

18:23.250 --> 18:23.791
I'll get you married.

18:24.291 --> 18:25.041
Majnu!

18:25.541 --> 18:28.291
Let it be, brother. It's not her fault.

18:28.791 --> 18:32.291
It's... - I admit it's my fault.

18:44.083 --> 18:46.208
Come.

18:46.708 --> 18:49.416
Uday, you're exactly like me.

18:49.916 --> 18:52.416
Emotional rascal.

18:52.916 --> 18:56.416
Now I can happily go on my pilgrimage.

19:05.666 --> 19:10.625
Sunder Shetty...now you can get married again.

19:11.125 --> 19:13.666
Now I can happily return India and give my exams.

19:14.166 --> 19:15.333
Your happiness is going to double-up.

19:15.833 --> 19:16.708
Soon you'll have a sister-in-law as well.

19:17.208 --> 19:18.916
My wife. - Or mine.

19:19.416 --> 19:21.833
Only one of us... - Is getting married.

19:22.333 --> 19:24.583
This marriage isn't possible,

19:25.083 --> 19:28.625
I mean...only until your sister doesn't get married.

19:29.125 --> 19:31.291
But what's our marriage got to do with hers?

19:31.791 --> 19:32.333
Yes, mom.

19:32.833 --> 19:35.916
Dear, you're forgetting who we are. - Who?

19:36.416 --> 19:39.166
The Queen and Princess of Nazabgarh.

19:39.666 --> 19:40.541
How can the brothers get married..

19:41.041 --> 19:42.666
..when their sister's still unmarried?

19:43.166 --> 19:44.125
What will the people of Nazabgarh say?

19:44.625 --> 19:45.666
Yes...what will they say?

19:46.166 --> 19:47.833
How can we find a decent guy so soon? - Yes.

19:48.333 --> 19:50.166
What's the hurry? Take your time.

19:50.666 --> 19:52.541
Your sister's not in a hurry nor are we.

19:53.041 --> 19:54.125
But we are.

19:54.625 --> 19:57.125
Look, call it our helplessness or our condition.

19:57.625 --> 20:01.750
But we cannot ignore our tradition and customs.

20:02.250 --> 20:05.750
Let's go, dear.

20:09.708 --> 20:11.291
Boss, don't fire.

20:11.791 --> 20:14.708
Control, Uday. - What control?

20:15.208 --> 20:18.708
Where will we find a decent boy from a respectable family?

20:26.833 --> 20:30.000
I will kill you today! - Ghunghroo!

20:30.500 --> 20:31.083
Have you gone crazy?

20:31.583 --> 20:33.125
You never let me stay normal.

20:33.625 --> 20:36.041
You were already married prior to our marriage.

20:36.541 --> 20:38.541
And you also have a son.

20:39.041 --> 20:41.708
And you hid this from me until now.

20:42.208 --> 20:43.958
I was going to tell you on our wedding night..

20:44.458 --> 20:45.458
..but you fell asleep after drinking the milk.

20:45.958 --> 20:47.125
I was only asleep, not dead.

20:47.625 --> 20:49.625
You could've told me the next day, you wretch.

20:50.125 --> 20:53.250
I tried to tell you, but you never gave me a chance.

20:53.750 --> 20:55.875
Did you expect me to call a press-conference to disclose this?

20:56.375 --> 20:58.708
You should be happy that you're a son.

20:59.208 --> 20:59.833
My son?

21:00.333 --> 21:02.833
I didn't cast my vote...

21:03.333 --> 21:06.541
...so how can he be my Chief Minister.

21:07.041 --> 21:09.750
What's the point of killing you?

21:10.250 --> 21:11.666
You can be happy with your son?

21:12.166 --> 21:13.916
I will renounce this world.

21:14.416 --> 21:18.291
Ghunghroo...you don't have to punish yourself for my mistakes.

21:18.791 --> 21:24.916
You know we couldn't beget a child even after numerous efforts.

21:25.416 --> 21:29.250
Lot of people called you uncle..

21:29.750 --> 21:32.000
..but no one called you papa.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.208
Daddy...papa.

21:34.708 --> 21:37.833
You're very lucky, Ghunghroo.

21:38.333 --> 21:43.833
Not many fathers get a young-grownup son.

21:44.333 --> 21:46.291
No hassles of dropping or picking up from school.

21:46.791 --> 21:49.541
No college...no donations.

21:50.041 --> 21:51.166
Direct son.

21:51.666 --> 21:54.875
And what about when you're dead?

21:55.375 --> 21:57.458
Who will perform your final rites?

21:57.958 --> 22:00.333
You'll wander around as a ghost.

22:00.833 --> 22:04.416
And if your son performs your final rites...you'll get salvation.

22:04.916 --> 22:08.750
He isn't just your son, he's a boon for us.

22:09.250 --> 22:10.958
Say something, Ghoongroo!

22:11.458 --> 22:13.916
Say something.

22:14.416 --> 22:17.666
Take me to my son.

22:18.166 --> 22:21.666
Take me to my son. - Ghoongroo!

22:37.583 --> 22:38.291
Hello.

22:38.791 --> 22:39.208
Hello.

22:39.708 --> 22:40.750
Hello, Ghoongroo sir.

22:41.250 --> 22:42.041
We paid a visit to your home..

22:42.541 --> 22:43.666
..and found out that you're heading towards the airport.

22:44.166 --> 22:47.333
And so we thought we'll seize on you on the way.

22:47.833 --> 22:48.458
Seize.

22:48.958 --> 22:50.666
What a great thought.

22:51.166 --> 22:52.833
By the way... where are you headed?

22:53.333 --> 22:54.166
India, to see our son.

22:54.666 --> 22:57.291
What?

22:57.791 --> 22:58.250
Son?

22:58.750 --> 22:59.875
Congratulations! - Congratulations!

23:00.375 --> 23:00.958
Congratulations! - Congratulations!

23:01.458 --> 23:06.583
You have a son? - Yes, our son.

23:07.083 --> 23:09.083
Your son? - More than a son.

23:09.583 --> 23:10.833
Congratulations! - Congratulations!

23:11.333 --> 23:13.041
Wait!

23:13.541 --> 23:14.833
You never told us you had a son.

23:15.333 --> 23:16.416
What do you mean by we didn't.

23:16.916 --> 23:17.916
I've a paternal and a maternal uncle as well.

23:18.416 --> 23:19.875
I never told you about them either.

23:20.375 --> 23:21.625
He lives in India. We hardly meet him.

23:22.125 --> 23:23.416
So what is all the questions for?

23:23.916 --> 23:25.791
No...no...don't get angry.

23:26.291 --> 23:29.166
Is he a bachelor? - Is he?

23:29.666 --> 23:30.750
You don't know whether he's a bachelor or not?

23:31.250 --> 23:33.458
I said he is a bachelor?

23:33.958 --> 23:36.416
You think I am being rhetorical.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.541
He's a bachelor...

23:39.041 --> 23:40.750
Congratulations! - Congratulations!

23:41.250 --> 23:43.625
That's exactly why we were coming to see you, Ghunghroo,

23:44.125 --> 23:45.458
So that you tell us of a decent boy in your family..

23:45.958 --> 23:48.041
..and we get our sister married to him.

23:48.541 --> 23:49.333
Sister?

23:49.833 --> 23:51.416
You never told me you've another sister.

23:51.916 --> 23:53.333
You didn't know either. - Not me, it's his.

23:53.833 --> 23:54.625
I mean...mine too.

23:55.125 --> 23:56.833
His kid sister.

23:57.333 --> 23:58.500
Probably...the last one.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.208
With the grace of God I've everything.

24:00.708 --> 24:02.000
Fame, Fortune...Respect.

24:02.500 --> 24:05.166
And thanks to my father... I've three mothers.

24:05.666 --> 24:06.750
Three mothers? - Yes.

24:07.250 --> 24:08.208
Since we'll be related soon..

24:08.708 --> 24:09.958
..there's no point in hiding it from you.

24:10.458 --> 24:12.375
I've a kid sister from the third mother.

24:12.875 --> 24:15.958
Great...he's got a sister.

24:16.458 --> 24:18.791
You don't look surprised? - Why should I?

24:19.291 --> 24:20.375
It happens with everyone.

24:20.875 --> 24:21.958
Some suddenly finds a sister..

24:22.458 --> 24:24.833
And some find a son, right.

24:25.333 --> 24:27.250
She's really cute, cultured, decent and beautiful.

24:27.750 --> 24:29.625
All I want is that you accept her as your daughter-in-law.

24:30.125 --> 24:32.875
Consider it done, Uday. It's a yes.

24:33.375 --> 24:35.208
Congratulations! - Congratulations!

24:35.708 --> 24:36.666
Hold on.

24:37.166 --> 24:39.416
Let me meet my son once. - What?

24:39.916 --> 24:42.083
I mean...you meet my son once.

24:42.583 --> 24:43.291
What's to see?

24:43.791 --> 24:46.791
Father's like sugar-cane... so the son must be like jiggery.

24:47.291 --> 24:49.541
Hey... Can't you can give a decent example?

24:50.041 --> 24:51.708
Then you give one.

24:52.208 --> 24:54.000
We're standing at the threshold of the temple..

24:54.500 --> 24:56.000
..then we're bound to find God Inside.

24:56.500 --> 24:58.250
We know you, there's no need to see your son.

24:58.750 --> 25:00.000
We can have no second thoughts..

25:00.500 --> 25:03.000
..about a respectable, decent and handsome man like you.

25:03.500 --> 25:06.250
Listen to me.. - We can talk later.

25:06.750 --> 25:08.416
It's a yes from us.

25:08.916 --> 25:09.833
Yes.

25:10.333 --> 25:12.833
Rascals...congratulate them now.

25:13.333 --> 25:15.416
Congratulations! - Congratulations!

25:15.916 --> 25:19.416
Congratulations! - Congratulations!

25:27.791 --> 25:31.583
Come on... it's Ajju bhai's birthday.

25:32.083 --> 25:33.333
Come on, aunty...pay up.

25:33.833 --> 25:34.916
Stop. Stop.

25:35.416 --> 25:37.500
It's Ajju bhai's birthday.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.583
He's here...he's here...

25:41.083 --> 25:43.750
Another one..

25:44.250 --> 25:45.041
Why are you begging?

25:45.541 --> 25:47.166
We're collecting donation.

25:47.666 --> 25:49.833
It's the same thing, only different spelling.

25:50.333 --> 25:51.083
Why are you collecting donation?

25:51.583 --> 25:52.958
It's Ajju bhai's birthday.

25:53.458 --> 25:54.291
Birthday? - Yes.

25:54.791 --> 25:57.291
I've heard about Gandhi Jayanti...Ambedkar Jayanti.

25:57.791 --> 25:59.708
Was your bhai some freedom fighter?

26:00.208 --> 26:01.958
Yes, he's a freedom fighter.

26:02.458 --> 26:04.500
He fights wherever he gets freedom.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.083
Come on, pay up.

26:06.583 --> 26:08.791
Stop arguing, just pay them.

26:09.291 --> 26:12.333
Fine...11 rupees. - Not 11 rupees...we want 11,000.

26:12.833 --> 26:14.541
11,000?

26:15.041 --> 26:17.750
Did your mother or your father leave that kind of money with me?

26:18.250 --> 26:19.125
Hey...

26:19.625 --> 26:21.041
Maybe you don't know who I am.

26:21.541 --> 26:24.083
Hey lady...you don't know who Ajju bhai is.

26:24.583 --> 26:29.625
Look. Turn around.

26:30.125 --> 26:33.625
Ajju bhai.. Ajju bhai.. Ajju bhai.. Ajju bhai..

26:59.458 --> 27:02.791
"I am a stormy soda."

27:03.291 --> 27:06.583
"I am the queen of carom."

27:07.083 --> 27:10.375
"I am a spicy fritter."

27:10.875 --> 27:14.208
"Makes your mouth water."

27:14.708 --> 27:17.458
"I am a match a stick."

27:17.958 --> 27:21.625
"That can light a wet cigarette."

27:22.125 --> 27:27.166
"Even rowdy's get sentimental for me."

27:27.666 --> 27:31.000
"I became Bubli and you became Bunty."

27:31.500 --> 27:34.833
"I became Bubli and you became Bunty."

27:35.333 --> 27:38.500
"And we played 20-20 in a closed room."

27:39.000 --> 27:42.291
"I became Bubli and you became Bunty."

27:42.791 --> 27:46.208
"And we played 20-20 in a closed room."

27:46.708 --> 27:49.958
"Fleece me... Fleece me... Fleece me.."

27:50.458 --> 27:53.375
"Fleece me... Fleece me... Fleece me.."

27:53.875 --> 27:57.208
"I've been fleeced by beautiful damsels..."

27:57.708 --> 28:00.750
"...by their black tresses, and rosy cheeks."

28:01.250 --> 28:04.625
"I've been fleeced by beautiful damsels..."

28:05.125 --> 28:08.625
"...by their black tresses, and rosy cheeks."

28:43.208 --> 28:47.625
"Shiny...shiny...shiny... shining queen."

28:48.125 --> 28:50.208
"Queen."

28:50.708 --> 28:54.750
"Luscious...luscious... luscious is your youth."

28:55.250 --> 28:58.041
"Youth."

28:58.541 --> 29:01.625
"As the veil slips down my body."

29:02.125 --> 29:06.625
"There's a chaos in neighborhood."

29:07.125 --> 29:12.125
"You're the bell that I keep ringing."

29:12.625 --> 29:16.000
"I became Bubli and you became Bunty."

29:16.500 --> 29:19.708
"I became Bubli and you became Bunty."

29:20.208 --> 29:23.458
"And we played 20-20 in a closed room."

29:23.958 --> 29:27.291
"You became Bubli and I became Bunty."

29:27.791 --> 29:32.416
"And we played 20-20 in a closed room."

29:32.916 --> 29:35.250
He's played enough 20-20, daddy.

29:35.750 --> 29:36.291
Yeah.

29:36.791 --> 29:39.625
Now slice his body into 50-50 and end this match.

29:40.125 --> 29:43.666
"Fleece me... Fleece me... Fleece me.."

29:44.166 --> 29:47.416
"I've been fleeced by beautiful damsels..."

29:47.916 --> 29:50.875
"...by their black tresses, and rosy cheeks."

29:51.375 --> 29:54.916
"I became Bubli and you became Bunty."

29:55.416 --> 29:58.833
"And we played 20-20 in a closed room."

29:59.333 --> 30:02.541
"Fleece me... Fleece me... Fleece me.."

30:03.041 --> 30:06.250
"Fleece me... Fleece me... Fleece me.."

30:06.750 --> 30:10.208
"Fleece me... Fleece me... Fleece me.."

30:10.708 --> 30:13.750
"Fleece me... Fleece me... Fleece me.."

30:14.250 --> 30:17.583
"Fleece me... Fleece me... Fleece me.."

30:18.083 --> 30:23.166
"Fleece me... Fleece me... Fleece me.."

30:23.666 --> 30:26.291
Aslam. Take my father inside.

30:26.791 --> 30:29.375
Uncle, go that way... No, not that way.

30:29.875 --> 30:31.208
Dr. Ghunghroo is Ajju's father?

30:31.708 --> 30:32.958
Aslam, run. - Come...come..

30:33.458 --> 30:36.958
Kill them both.

31:01.625 --> 31:03.166
I am not Tipu Sultan.

31:03.666 --> 31:04.791
I don't know how to use this.

31:05.291 --> 31:07.125
Give me a shield to protect myself.

31:07.625 --> 31:11.125
Let's go. Come on.

31:17.625 --> 31:21.125
No - Ghunghroo!

31:27.750 --> 31:30.583
"Here he comes."

31:31.083 --> 31:33.958
"Ajju bhai."

31:34.458 --> 31:37.250
"Here he comes."

31:37.750 --> 31:41.250
"Ajju bhai."

31:45.125 --> 31:46.708
Catch him.

31:47.208 --> 31:50.708
Catch him.

32:26.125 --> 32:29.625
Oh my God!

32:37.375 --> 32:40.250
"Here he comes."

32:40.750 --> 32:43.625
"Ajju bhai."

32:44.125 --> 32:48.750
"Here he comes."

32:49.250 --> 32:51.166
"Ajju bhai."

32:51.666 --> 32:52.791
Mister, why don't you do something?

32:53.291 --> 32:54.250
Me? You're the police.

32:54.750 --> 32:55.208
What do you expect?

32:55.708 --> 32:57.916
Do you wish to see me in my grave next?

32:58.416 --> 33:01.500
If these two leave, this city will be in a much better condition.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.041
Who? - First is Ajju.

33:04.541 --> 33:06.375
And the other? - Ajju as well.

33:06.875 --> 33:10.375
He's a big menace.

33:16.708 --> 33:21.375
"Here he comes."

33:21.875 --> 33:24.833
"Ajju bhai."

33:25.333 --> 33:28.250
"Here he comes."

33:28.750 --> 33:31.625
"Ajju bhai."

33:32.125 --> 33:35.166
"Here he comes."

33:35.666 --> 33:38.541
"Ajju bhai."

33:39.041 --> 33:41.625
"Ajju bhai."

33:42.125 --> 33:46.250
Hey no! - Ajju bhai.

33:46.750 --> 33:48.833
Ghunghroo.

33:49.333 --> 33:50.083
"Ajju bhai."

33:50.583 --> 33:51.583
Ghunghroo.

33:52.083 --> 33:54.208
Ghunghroo, are you still alive. - Ba***

33:54.708 --> 33:56.791
Ghunghroo? - Get lost you, b***

33:57.291 --> 33:59.875
Stop messing with my brain. Don't make my temperature soar.

34:00.375 --> 34:04.291
Ghunghroo, what's wrong with your language. - Yeah!

34:04.791 --> 34:08.250
I spent only 12 hours with him, and I'm already sounding like him.

34:08.750 --> 34:11.458
This...pound of flesh will get me salvation.

34:11.958 --> 34:14.541
What kind of boon did you bless me with, Lord?

34:15.041 --> 34:18.500
Uday and Majnu have turned decent.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.083
I cannot cheat them.

34:21.583 --> 34:23.208
I will tell them the truth.

34:23.708 --> 34:24.416
Quiet!

34:24.916 --> 34:26.833
How dare you hide such a big truth?

34:27.333 --> 34:28.666
All the marriage preparations are done..

34:29.166 --> 34:31.541
..and now you cheat us.

34:32.041 --> 34:33.083
Why didn't you tell us?

34:33.583 --> 34:35.375
I told the biggest lie ever.

34:35.875 --> 34:39.291
I was supposed to get a Red bridal dress for your sister..

34:39.791 --> 34:40.541
..but I got Maroon instead.

34:41.041 --> 34:43.583
A bride's dress is always Red.

34:44.083 --> 34:46.583
Didn't anyone tell you?

34:47.083 --> 34:48.875
Mister...save me please.

34:49.375 --> 34:54.041
These guys have been playing me non-stop for the past 8 hours.

34:54.541 --> 34:56.166
My condition is worse than... Iraq

34:56.666 --> 34:58.708
But...why you dancing?

34:59.208 --> 35:00.916
This is my punishment.

35:01.416 --> 35:01.708
Punishment.

35:02.208 --> 35:05.750
They want me to keep dancing and enjoy the beating session.

35:06.250 --> 35:06.958
I am enjoying getting beaten up.

35:07.458 --> 35:08.791
If I had danced so much in a dance-bar..

35:09.291 --> 35:11.791
..I would've made millions.

35:12.291 --> 35:13.375
Majnu, don't beat him.

35:14.333 --> 35:16.250
Don't forget that you guys have become decent now.

35:16.750 --> 35:21.583
We've turned decent doesn't mean anyone can cheat us.

35:22.083 --> 35:23.791
Where are you going?

35:24.291 --> 35:25.916
What would Uday say?

35:26.416 --> 35:28.333
Uday sir couldn't see all this.

35:28.833 --> 35:29.541
Yes.

35:30.041 --> 35:31.500
That's why he already left.

35:32.000 --> 35:32.541
See...

35:33.041 --> 35:33.666
Yes, we did.

35:34.166 --> 35:37.000
But the boss said we should disrobe him completely.

35:37.500 --> 35:38.250
And leave only his underwear.

35:38.750 --> 35:39.250
Why only underwear?

35:39.750 --> 35:39.958
Its better you beat me instead.

35:40.458 --> 35:41.875
Beat him...and take his underwear as well.

35:42.375 --> 35:43.791
Beat him.

35:44.291 --> 35:47.791
I don't even wear underwear.

35:56.958 --> 35:59.708
Uncle...those rascals even took my underwear.

36:00.208 --> 36:01.416
How will I go home now?

36:01.916 --> 36:04.458
Forget about you, I am wondering how I'll live in this city.

36:04.958 --> 36:07.208
Did you hide a truth as well?

36:07.708 --> 36:08.708
Keep it concealed.

36:09.208 --> 36:11.833
Don't disclose it...otherwise two people can adjust behind one radio.

36:12.333 --> 36:14.625
What do I hide and what do I disclose?

36:15.125 --> 36:17.125
These rascals haven't reformed yet.

36:17.625 --> 36:18.916
At first they were only rascals.

36:19.416 --> 36:21.208
But now...they've become bloody rascals.

36:21.708 --> 36:26.333
I don't know what to do.

36:26.833 --> 36:30.416
You're still a bachelor, right? - How do you know?

36:30.916 --> 36:33.375
Your personality.

36:33.875 --> 36:34.750
Why? What's wrong with me?

36:35.250 --> 36:38.208
Tell me...if I send your picture to some girl..

36:38.708 --> 36:40.166
..will she say yes for marriage?

36:40.666 --> 36:41.666
Never. She would rather choose to die.

36:42.166 --> 36:44.541
Right...I knew it. I knew it.

36:45.041 --> 36:45.958
Don't...

36:46.458 --> 36:48.791
If you move the radio, it will tune to a different channel.

36:49.291 --> 36:50.000
And I'll be humiliated.

36:50.500 --> 36:53.541
I will avenge your humiliation. Me.

36:54.041 --> 36:54.541
How?

36:55.041 --> 36:58.708
I'll send your picture instead of my son to their sister.

36:59.208 --> 37:00.416
So that she breaks-off this marriage.

37:00.916 --> 37:05.000
They use their hands and feet a lot, even bullets..

37:05.500 --> 37:08.000
..but they can't rack their brains like me.

37:08.500 --> 37:10.375
They will come personally to break off their sister's marriage.

37:10.875 --> 37:15.666
And I will humiliate them in a way they've never been humiliated before.

37:16.166 --> 37:17.541
Very good, uncle.

37:18.041 --> 37:22.458
Insult them so bad that even the Ipod can't hide their shame.

37:22.958 --> 37:23.208
Come on, son.

37:23.708 --> 37:26.916
There. Take shots from different angles, uncle.

37:27.416 --> 37:29.416
No...one is enough. - Okay.

37:29.916 --> 37:32.666
I just need to break-off this relation, not kill the girl.

37:33.166 --> 37:34.291
One's enough. - Okay.

37:34.791 --> 37:39.666
Ready?

37:40.166 --> 37:42.208
How is it?

37:42.708 --> 37:45.583
Amazing. You look uglier in the picture.

37:46.083 --> 37:46.958
My mother used to say the same thing. Show me.

37:47.458 --> 37:50.958
Look.

37:53.583 --> 37:55.333
Hey...

37:55.833 --> 37:59.333
I think he's dead. Death without underwear, oh God.

38:03.083 --> 38:05.583
Look at the boy they chose for me.

38:06.083 --> 38:07.666
Quickly say no to your brothers.

38:08.166 --> 38:09.833
He'll feel bad if I say it over the phone.

38:10.333 --> 38:13.833
I'll be seeing him after the exams. I'll explain him them.

38:16.875 --> 38:18.125
Sheetal, what's all this?

38:18.625 --> 38:19.750
Rose...greeting card?

38:20.250 --> 38:22.041
Seems like someone's blindly in love with you.

38:22.541 --> 38:23.416
I can't say whether he's blind..

38:23.916 --> 38:27.416
..but, he's definitely deaf and dumb.

38:27.916 --> 38:29.375
Either flowers...or cards.

38:29.875 --> 38:31.250
And if I don't take it, he resorts to hooliganism.

38:31.750 --> 38:33.250
And today he's crossed all limits.

38:33.750 --> 38:35.833
He's invited me to watch a movie together.

38:36.333 --> 38:39.083
He's made my life hell.

38:39.583 --> 38:41.208
Sheetal...relax.

38:41.708 --> 38:43.916
I'll teach that roadside-romeo a lesson.

38:44.416 --> 38:47.041
I'll decently explain him what does he think my friend is.

38:47.541 --> 38:49.166
If he teases you again, I'll cut off his legs.

38:49.666 --> 38:51.250
Just tell me where I can find him.

38:51.750 --> 38:52.750
See those guys sitting there.

38:53.250 --> 38:55.708
It's the boy in blue shirt.

38:56.208 --> 38:59.416
Wait her, I'll talk to him in his language.

38:59.916 --> 39:03.041
"Here comes...Ajju bhai."

39:03.541 --> 39:05.458
Javed...go get tea for everyone.

39:05.958 --> 39:07.000
"Here comes...Ajju bhai."

39:07.500 --> 39:07.875
You go.

39:08.375 --> 39:09.583
And stop making gestures. Go on.

39:10.083 --> 39:14.708
Boss, you make a dumb guy talk too much. - That's how I am.

39:15.208 --> 39:16.791
How are you sweetheart? - Rascal.

39:17.291 --> 39:18.583
What's all this?

39:19.083 --> 39:21.333
Bhai...its love.

39:21.833 --> 39:23.875
Love.

39:24.375 --> 39:25.375
Shut up, rascals.

39:25.875 --> 39:28.166
I don't like this cheekiness.

39:28.666 --> 39:29.750
First you flirt with some girl...

39:30.250 --> 39:31.166
Then you follow her...

39:31.666 --> 39:33.166
And then write love-letters.

39:33.666 --> 39:35.583
I can see myself falling in love..

39:36.083 --> 39:38.666
..only when some girl walks up to me herself.

39:39.166 --> 39:43.375
She stands before me in style, stares into my eyes and says...

39:43.875 --> 39:44.166
"I Love You."

39:44.666 --> 39:48.166
Wow, boss... amazing.

40:00.125 --> 40:03.625
Bhai, she's dumb.

40:11.583 --> 40:15.083
And deaf too.

40:19.500 --> 40:23.000
Damn..

40:25.875 --> 40:27.958
Bhai...she's saying "I Love You".

40:28.458 --> 40:32.291
I Love You?

40:32.791 --> 40:34.125
PVR Cinema...Sunday 12 to 3.

40:34.625 --> 40:38.250
We'll also see the film if we get the time.

40:38.750 --> 40:40.333
Bhai, she's asking for a reply.

40:40.833 --> 40:45.583
So fast. - I know.

40:46.083 --> 40:49.583
She's saying if you don't reply, she'll cut off your legs.

40:59.750 --> 41:03.250
Bhai, did you see the way you gave the flower?

41:07.208 --> 41:08.375
Who will give a flower to you?

41:08.875 --> 41:09.291
Quiet!

41:09.791 --> 41:13.291
This is for bhai... from sister-in-law.

41:40.708 --> 41:44.375
Bhai, this is a flower... not a knife.

41:44.875 --> 41:46.583
Hold it like this.

41:47.083 --> 41:50.125
Bhai, men always look for a wife that speaks less.

41:50.625 --> 41:52.458
But thankfully sister-in-law's completely mute.

41:52.958 --> 41:53.500
Yes, bhai.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.958
And there's a lot of similarity between the two of you.

41:56.458 --> 41:59.458
You never listen... and she'll never hear anyone.

41:59.958 --> 42:01.750
Right, Javed.

42:02.250 --> 42:07.750
Since bhai's fallen in love, you seem uncomfortable.

42:08.250 --> 42:09.500
Shut up.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.083
Bhai...why are you so quiet?

42:12.583 --> 42:15.375
What do I say?

42:15.875 --> 42:19.625
When she was trying to gesture her feelings..

42:20.125 --> 42:21.333
..it felt like someone was..

42:21.833 --> 42:26.041
..firing at me with a AK-47 fitted with a silencer.

42:26.541 --> 42:30.041
No sound...no bullets fired... but my heart's been shot.

43:04.500 --> 43:05.416
Boss...phone.

43:05.916 --> 43:07.083
"Majnu..."

43:07.583 --> 43:10.125
Good morning.

43:10.625 --> 43:11.333
Good morning.

43:11.833 --> 43:15.333
Good morning, how are you?

43:20.583 --> 43:22.875
Why so quiet?

43:23.375 --> 43:26.875
What are you looking at?

43:28.958 --> 43:31.041
Last night... I had an overheated discussion..

43:31.541 --> 43:33.500
..about your love with my heart.

43:34.000 --> 43:38.041
And in the morning... you two won.

43:38.541 --> 43:44.000
You're sentenced to love for life under section love.

43:44.500 --> 43:48.000
I have decided... that I will marry you.

43:48.500 --> 43:50.000
Really?

43:50.500 --> 43:51.375
Did you two hear?

43:51.875 --> 43:52.958
Yes. - I am the prince of Najabgarh now.

43:53.458 --> 43:54.333
I won! I won!

43:54.833 --> 43:57.250
Majnu's out.

43:57.750 --> 43:59.875
The real Majnu (Romeo) never got his Laila (Juliet)..

44:00.375 --> 44:01.958
..so how can this Majnu.

44:02.458 --> 44:03.250
Correct.

44:03.750 --> 44:05.125
This is going to be fun.

44:05.625 --> 44:08.291
Go and give this good news to Uday. - No!

44:08.791 --> 44:10.333
You won't do anything like that. - Why?

44:10.833 --> 44:11.333
Why?

44:11.833 --> 44:14.208
Your friend loves me a lot.

44:14.708 --> 44:17.958
What if this news shocks him to death?

44:18.458 --> 44:20.208
I know you're a very nice man.

44:20.708 --> 44:25.708
And you wouldn't want your friend, who's like a brother to you, to die.

44:26.208 --> 44:27.125
He's right.

44:27.625 --> 44:30.125
That's fine, but.. - What about our marriage?

44:30.625 --> 44:31.291
What about our marriage?

44:31.791 --> 44:33.083
Leave that to me.

44:33.583 --> 44:37.750
I know it's a bit difficult, but I'll explain him.

44:38.250 --> 44:44.416
But for my sake, you will never let him find out about our relation.

44:44.916 --> 44:46.083
You've gone crazy in love.

44:46.583 --> 44:49.500
How could you forget, that our only ancestral manor in Nazabgarh..

44:50.000 --> 44:53.000
..is on the verge of being auctioned?

44:53.500 --> 44:57.041
How will I get 20 million to save it?

44:57.541 --> 44:59.125
"Majnu..."

44:59.625 --> 45:00.333
"Laila..."

45:00.833 --> 45:01.208
Come on.

45:01.708 --> 45:02.708
Only 20 million.

45:03.208 --> 45:05.083
Tell the queen she'll get her 20 million in 30 minutes.

45:05.583 --> 45:07.875
Tell her. - Only 20 million.

45:08.375 --> 45:10.125
No need to worry.

45:10.625 --> 45:13.416
Lawyer... - Cheque book's ready.

45:13.916 --> 45:15.458
How sweet of you.

45:15.958 --> 45:17.125
You've such a big heart.

45:17.625 --> 45:20.666
I did the right thing by choosing you as my life-partner.

45:21.166 --> 45:21.958
I love you my love.

45:22.458 --> 45:23.166
I love you too, baby.

45:23.666 --> 45:29.500
I love you too.. - Boss.

45:30.000 --> 45:31.375
Why did you bring me here, Ranjana?

45:31.875 --> 45:34.291
I want to see what a big lover is he?

45:34.791 --> 45:36.666
Whether he comes here even after I warned him yesterday.

45:37.166 --> 45:39.916
"Here he comes...Ajju bhai."

45:40.416 --> 45:41.250
Ticket. - Don't want it.

45:41.750 --> 45:42.416
I am asking for your ticket.

45:42.916 --> 45:43.583
Give him the ticket.

45:44.083 --> 45:46.833
Why you..

45:47.333 --> 45:48.875
Enough...let's go.

45:49.375 --> 45:53.458
I only asked for a ticket, but you guys gave me the monthly pass instead.

45:53.958 --> 45:55.500
What? 17 guns?

45:56.000 --> 45:57.166
And adding these 3 makes it 20.

45:57.666 --> 45:58.250
But Pappu only asked for 15.

45:58.750 --> 45:59.333
Where is she?

45:59.833 --> 46:00.958
Ranjana.

46:01.458 --> 46:01.625
Look.

46:02.125 --> 46:03.375
There she is.

46:03.875 --> 46:04.541
"He'll be happy."

46:05.041 --> 46:06.541
"And listen, we'll sell these at the flea market."

46:07.041 --> 46:08.875
He's really shameless.

46:09.375 --> 46:09.541
Let him come.

46:10.041 --> 46:11.291
But don't tell Pappu. - I won't.

46:11.791 --> 46:14.583
Rascal, where are the three guns?

46:15.083 --> 46:18.583
What three guns?

46:32.166 --> 46:35.666
What is this brother?

46:49.916 --> 46:51.083
What?

46:51.583 --> 46:53.500
See

46:54.000 --> 46:58.791
Yes.. - Shut up

46:59.291 --> 47:05.250
"Baby."

47:05.750 --> 47:07.416
I'll give you any price you want.

47:07.916 --> 47:11.416
But who did you sell the gun to?

47:28.625 --> 47:30.791
Bhai, you made a mistake..

47:31.291 --> 47:32.708
..and made us pay the price.

47:33.208 --> 47:34.416
Mistake me?

47:34.916 --> 47:39.333
Bhai, she was not a school kid that you kissed her on the cheeks.

47:39.833 --> 47:42.208
You could've kissed her lips, but you kissed her cheek instead.

47:42.708 --> 47:44.250
This happened in the 70's.

47:44.750 --> 47:45.416
Shame on you.

47:45.916 --> 47:48.333
Bhai...you should've done as she did.

47:48.833 --> 47:51.000
Lip-to-lip, bhai.

47:51.500 --> 47:53.166
But you kissed her cheeks instead.

47:53.666 --> 47:55.791
Is that why she slapped me? - Yes.

47:56.291 --> 47:58.125
Sister-in-law thought you're Emraan Hashmi..

47:58.625 --> 48:01.625
..but you turned out to be Amol Palekar.

48:02.125 --> 48:04.375
What the...

48:04.875 --> 48:08.500
I made a big mistake.

48:09.000 --> 48:12.916
Why didn't you tell me earlier that he isn't the boy, It was such a big misunderstanding.

48:13.416 --> 48:15.250
I even slapped the poor guy.

48:15.750 --> 48:17.458
I wonder what he must be thinking about me.

48:17.958 --> 48:20.625
Then say sorry. - But where will I find him?

48:21.125 --> 48:24.625
No need to go anywhere, there he is.

48:33.833 --> 48:37.333
Say sorry.

48:44.083 --> 48:47.583
Liping bro, liping.

48:51.416 --> 48:54.916
That...

48:58.166 --> 49:00.958
I don't understand anything you're saying.

49:01.458 --> 49:05.791
You can talk?

49:06.291 --> 49:08.041
Of course I can. but... you can talk too?

49:08.541 --> 49:08.916
Yes.

49:09.416 --> 49:11.458
But why were you talking in gestures?

49:11.958 --> 49:15.458
Because my boys said that you're deaf and dumb.

49:22.208 --> 49:24.208
I am glad that you can talk and listen.

49:24.708 --> 49:26.791
Even I'm glad that you're not deaf or dumb.

49:27.291 --> 49:28.625
Now I can apologies.

49:29.125 --> 49:32.166
It was my mistake, why will you apologies?

49:32.666 --> 49:33.375
Your mistake?

49:33.875 --> 49:36.375
I had no idea I was supposed to kiss you on your lips.

49:36.875 --> 49:40.375
What? - Yeah!

49:58.625 --> 50:00.958
"Listen... - What?"

50:01.458 --> 50:03.416
"There's something in my heart, can I say it?"

50:03.916 --> 50:08.250
"Do you want me...to bring you the stars...like other crazy lovers?"

50:08.750 --> 50:15.916
"You can wear the bridal dress...and I'll wear a coat."

50:16.416 --> 50:18.291
"Don't delay any more."

50:18.791 --> 50:20.833
"Come be my wife."

50:21.333 --> 50:25.958
"We'll get married in Mumbai... and honeymoon in Dubai."

50:26.458 --> 50:31.000
"What's the hurry... to be your wife so soon?"

50:31.500 --> 50:36.083
"I still have to tell my brothers...about you?"

50:36.583 --> 50:41.083
"There's a feeling in my heart... and the ambiance is thrilling."

50:41.583 --> 50:46.041
"But you will have to wait... don't be a psycho."

50:46.541 --> 50:48.541
"Don't delay any more."

50:49.041 --> 50:51.000
"Come be my wife."

50:51.500 --> 50:56.291
"We'll get married in Mumbai... and honeymoon in Dubai."

50:56.791 --> 51:01.250
"What's the hurry... to be your wife so soon?"

51:01.750 --> 51:05.250
"I still have to tell my brothers...about you?"

51:22.208 --> 51:24.125
"We can be a couple..."

51:24.625 --> 51:26.708
"First you stop being a bully."

51:27.208 --> 51:29.250
"Button up your shirt completely..."

51:29.750 --> 51:31.625
"...and change your style slightly."

51:32.125 --> 51:34.291
"You're my sweetheart."

51:34.791 --> 51:36.833
"I'll do what you say."

51:37.333 --> 51:41.916
"I kissed you once... and my life changed completely."

51:42.416 --> 51:44.375
"My heart's jumping...jumping.."

51:44.875 --> 51:47.000
"How about we do lipping...lipping."

51:47.500 --> 51:54.541
"But you will have to wait...don't be a psycho."

51:55.041 --> 51:56.708
"Don't delay any more."

51:57.208 --> 51:59.291
"Come be my wife."

51:59.791 --> 52:04.250
"We'll get married in Mumbai... and honeymoon in Dubai."

52:04.750 --> 52:09.458
"What's the hurry...to be your wife so soon?"

52:09.958 --> 52:13.458
"I still have to tell my brothers...about you?"

52:45.708 --> 52:46.916
Why are you walking like this?

52:47.416 --> 52:50.958
I shutdown all my bad business' for you.

52:51.458 --> 52:51.875
I have become descent.

52:52.375 --> 52:53.750
It'll take me some time to change my style.

52:54.250 --> 52:57.000
And it will take brother lesser time to recognize you.

52:57.500 --> 52:58.416
You've changed from Ajju to Ajay..

52:58.916 --> 53:01.000
..so learn to walk and speak like a descent man.

53:01.500 --> 53:02.833
Fine...don't worry.

53:03.333 --> 53:04.333
I'll try my best.

53:04.833 --> 53:08.333
And stop using these slangs. - Okay.

53:08.833 --> 53:14.541
Please don't give brother high BP. - Okay, fine.

53:15.041 --> 53:16.833
Sir...it's still increasing, sir.

53:17.333 --> 53:19.916
Boss, you get worried over trivial reasons.

53:20.416 --> 53:22.208
It's a small thing.. - Small thing?

53:22.708 --> 53:23.666
Did your father get married three times..

53:24.166 --> 53:25.458
..and created such hassles?

53:25.958 --> 53:27.916
I've fixed Ranjana's marriage somewhere else.

53:28.416 --> 53:30.041
And now she's in love with someone else.

53:30.541 --> 53:31.500
And she's going to introduce us to him today.

53:32.000 --> 53:32.625
Is this a small thing?

53:33.125 --> 53:35.916
Boss... - Ranjana's here.

53:36.416 --> 53:37.666
Brother.

53:38.166 --> 53:39.750
What's all this? - Nothing.

53:40.250 --> 53:41.833
Just my routine checkup, everything's normal.

53:42.333 --> 53:43.125
Sit. Sit...

53:43.625 --> 53:43.833
Sit...

53:44.333 --> 53:51.875
Sir, can I sit too? - Ajay. Brother asked us both to sit.

53:52.375 --> 53:53.666
Thank you, sir.

53:54.166 --> 53:55.041
What would you like to have?

53:55.541 --> 53:57.375
Cutting..

53:57.875 --> 54:00.416
He means nothing... Nothing.

54:00.916 --> 54:01.625
I don't drink tea.

54:02.125 --> 54:07.958
Brother, I'm sure you chose a descent boy for me.

54:08.458 --> 54:11.958
But Ajay...is really nice.

54:16.916 --> 54:19.333
Brother, we really love each other.

54:19.833 --> 54:22.041
And so Ajay and I... - Marriage...

54:22.541 --> 54:23.541
You two want to get married.

54:24.041 --> 54:26.916
Are you angry? - No, no, I am not angry.

54:27.416 --> 54:29.750
It's a really small thing.

54:30.250 --> 54:32.625
If you're happy, I am happy.

54:33.125 --> 54:35.791
You're not just my responsibility, in fact you're my life.

54:36.291 --> 54:40.458
Sir...mom and dad... - All my three mothers are dead.

54:40.958 --> 54:42.416
And father will be soon.

54:42.916 --> 54:44.666
No, he meant his mom and dad.

54:45.166 --> 54:47.166
He wants to know when he can introduce them to you.

54:47.666 --> 54:49.750
Yeah...we'll meet them.

54:50.250 --> 54:52.958
Once I cancel this wedding.

54:53.458 --> 54:55.125
They are really decent people.

54:55.625 --> 54:58.375
It's really tough to explain descent people.

54:58.875 --> 55:00.041
Let me know if it gets too tough for you.

55:00.541 --> 55:01.000
Huh?

55:01.500 --> 55:04.833
He means, if it's too awkward for you..

55:05.333 --> 55:06.458
..then he'll go request them.

55:06.958 --> 55:08.000
No...it's alright.

55:08.500 --> 55:08.958
I'll handle it.

55:09.458 --> 55:09.750
Yes, sir.

55:10.250 --> 55:13.916
That's life. I'll handle it.

55:14.416 --> 55:17.666
Sir, can I say something? - Of course.

55:18.166 --> 55:20.458
You see, matches are made in heaven.

55:20.958 --> 55:23.458
And people only create problems.

55:23.958 --> 55:26.208
Like...Romeo-Juliet.

55:26.708 --> 55:28.750
Devdas-Paro. Shirin-Farhad.

55:29.250 --> 55:29.708
What?

55:30.208 --> 55:31.583
Shirin-Farhad. - Who?

55:32.083 --> 55:35.250
Shirin-Farhad? What about them?

55:35.750 --> 55:40.916
You know their love... - Knot?

55:41.416 --> 55:43.958
No...

55:44.458 --> 55:47.625
Chewing gum?

55:48.125 --> 55:49.125
Bond. - Bond.

55:49.625 --> 55:49.958
Bond!

55:50.458 --> 55:50.666
Bond! - What about it?

55:51.166 --> 55:54.125
People break that bond.

55:54.625 --> 55:57.250
But we'll get married.

55:57.750 --> 56:01.250
You're with us.

56:07.833 --> 56:09.750
Who's she in love with? - A boy...tall, handsome.

56:10.250 --> 56:12.333
Wears glasses. He seems from a descent family.

56:12.833 --> 56:13.916
Descent?

56:14.416 --> 56:17.375
We didn't exactly fix her marriage with some dacoit.

56:17.875 --> 56:18.750
How did she fall in love?

56:19.250 --> 56:20.958
Who will explain this to that old man?

56:21.458 --> 56:23.083
What old man? - That Ghunghroo...

56:23.583 --> 56:24.833
He should've been begging at our feet..

56:25.333 --> 56:27.000
..but he made him our relative instead.

56:27.500 --> 56:30.875
And now he'll make us dance to his tunes.

56:31.375 --> 56:34.375
If he finds out we've chosen someone else..

56:34.875 --> 56:36.041
..he'll curse us over and over again.

56:36.541 --> 56:37.916
We're brothers after all.

56:38.416 --> 56:38.958
We'll share it together.

56:39.458 --> 56:41.416
I'll take some... and you can take some.

56:41.916 --> 56:43.166
What about the rest?

56:43.666 --> 56:45.375
You.. - You all will take the rest.

56:45.875 --> 56:47.291
You rascals.

56:47.791 --> 56:49.666
You were all so eager in congratulating him.

56:50.166 --> 56:53.666
Now pay!

56:58.208 --> 56:59.541
You all here...so suddenly.

57:00.041 --> 57:01.083
Is everything okay?

57:01.583 --> 57:03.166
We.. - What's wrong?

57:03.666 --> 57:04.000
Come, sit.

57:04.500 --> 57:05.583
Sit.

57:06.083 --> 57:07.958
Greetings, sit.

57:08.458 --> 57:10.583
Rafiq. Get tea and snacks for the guests.

57:11.083 --> 57:12.041
Snacks?

57:12.541 --> 57:13.666
You won't get it. - What?

57:14.166 --> 57:15.000
They will cancel it.

57:15.500 --> 57:18.125
So, Uday...what is it?

57:18.625 --> 57:19.958
Shirin-Farhad.

57:20.458 --> 57:21.291
Shirin-Farhad?

57:21.791 --> 57:24.750
I mean...in love.. - I don't get it.

57:25.250 --> 57:26.916
Matches are made in heaven..

57:27.416 --> 57:28.916
This marriage isn't possible.

57:29.416 --> 57:31.375
What are you saying, Uday? - Let them say it.

57:31.875 --> 57:35.583
I was yearning to hear them say this.

57:36.083 --> 57:37.458
What are you saying?

57:37.958 --> 57:39.750
What do you mean by this marriage isn't possible? - I mean..

57:40.250 --> 57:41.916
Have you all lost your mind?

57:42.416 --> 57:45.583
I've booked everything... right from the horse to the DJ.

57:46.083 --> 57:46.541
What's more...

57:47.041 --> 57:49.791
We've even decided who's going to do the serpent dance.

57:50.291 --> 57:51.875
So now who's going to sit on the horse?

57:52.375 --> 57:53.708
Who's going to do the serpent dance?

57:54.208 --> 57:55.708
Even we fixed everything..

57:56.208 --> 57:57.125
..from our sister's Mehendi to Daler Mahendi.

57:57.625 --> 57:59.041
What? - Daler Mahendi.

57:59.541 --> 58:00.166
Daler Mahendi.

58:00.666 --> 58:02.291
But you see...she's in love with someone else.

58:02.791 --> 58:04.250
So what can I do? Please don't mind.

58:04.750 --> 58:07.958
No, no, of course not. Do you want me to distribute blankets to the poor?

58:08.458 --> 58:09.750
Why did he point towards us?

58:10.250 --> 58:11.541
He meant him.

58:12.041 --> 58:13.375
Mr. Uday Shetty. - Yes.

58:13.875 --> 58:16.000
My son agreed to marry your daughter..

58:16.500 --> 58:18.875
..without even taking a look.

58:19.375 --> 58:20.375
Without a single look. - Yes.

58:20.875 --> 58:22.666
If that decent boy finds out..

58:23.166 --> 58:26.625
..that her future wife is cozying-up with someone else..

58:27.125 --> 58:28.583
..won't that decent man be upset?

58:29.083 --> 58:31.666
It will, don't worry God's blessed me everything...

58:32.166 --> 58:33.250
Yeah right...Fame...Fortune...!

58:33.750 --> 58:36.541
Respect. - Respect? You still have respect?

58:37.041 --> 58:38.291
Yes...I still do.

58:38.791 --> 58:40.416
We'll find a girl for your son.

58:40.916 --> 58:43.916
See that. These two can't find a girl for themselves.

58:44.416 --> 58:46.000
They are roaming around like raging bulls..

58:46.500 --> 58:48.666
..and they claim they'll find a girl for my son.

58:49.166 --> 58:50.125
Right.

58:50.625 --> 58:52.291
My son would rather stay bachelor..

58:52.791 --> 58:54.916
..than marry someone from your family.

58:55.416 --> 58:57.958
And yes, if your father remarries for the fourth time..

58:58.458 --> 59:00.958
..and bring forth another sister.

59:01.458 --> 59:04.083
Then before fixing her marriage.

59:04.583 --> 59:06.416
..don't forget to ask her if she's having an affair too.

59:06.916 --> 59:07.750
Control! Control!

59:08.250 --> 59:09.083
What if she's in love?

59:09.583 --> 59:11.083
What are you saying?

59:11.583 --> 59:13.833
You shouldn't forget that they're our relatives.

59:14.333 --> 59:15.083
Relatives?

59:15.583 --> 59:18.500
They should be entombed.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.041
People swear on my decency...

59:21.541 --> 59:25.375
...but after this will I be able to face anyone.

59:25.875 --> 59:29.000
Control, Uday! Control.

59:29.500 --> 59:32.166
Boss...is your gun loaded? - Yes.

59:32.666 --> 59:37.041
Then fire... - No! It's our fault.

59:37.541 --> 59:40.041
It's not such a big mistake,

59:40.541 --> 59:42.208
He's being too smart.

59:42.708 --> 59:43.708
I'll talk to him.

59:44.208 --> 59:48.125
You? - I know how to handle people like him.

59:48.625 --> 59:50.375
Ghungroo, I was saying...

59:50.875 --> 59:53.291
Shut up crooked shoulder.

59:53.791 --> 59:56.791
Bloody rascal, scoundrel, good-for-nothing, scum.

59:57.291 --> 59:58.041
But that doesn't rhyme.

59:58.541 --> 59:59.625
Stop thinking about the rhyme.

01:00:00.125 --> 01:00:02.458
Concentrate on the cusswords.

01:00:02.958 --> 01:00:04.125
And when the brother's Majnu(Romeo)..

01:00:04.625 --> 01:00:06.500
..sister's bound to be someone's Laila(Juliet).

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.291
She must be involved with someone.

01:00:10.791 --> 01:00:11.291
What are you looking at?

01:00:11.791 --> 01:00:12.333
What are you looking at?

01:00:12.833 --> 01:00:14.458
You want to hit me?

01:00:14.958 --> 01:00:16.791
Hit me. Come on...hit me.

01:00:17.291 --> 01:00:19.666
Goons...bloody goons. You will never reform.

01:00:20.166 --> 01:00:21.791
You're only wearing this garb of decency.

01:00:22.291 --> 01:00:24.208
Ghunghroo...we're embarrassed too.

01:00:24.708 --> 01:00:26.375
I don't care.

01:00:26.875 --> 01:00:30.375
Go and hide your shameless faces. - Please..

01:00:53.583 --> 01:00:57.291
Why did you come here? I told you I'll deal with them.

01:00:57.791 --> 01:00:59.916
Sir...this is my home.

01:01:00.416 --> 01:01:02.250
So Ghunghroo's a paying-guest here?

01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:03.750
Sir, he's my father.

01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:05.625
My dad.

01:01:06.125 --> 01:01:10.375
Ghunghroo...

01:01:10.875 --> 01:01:14.291
This is amazing, Ghunghroo.

01:01:14.791 --> 01:01:15.666
All this was a little hard to understand.

01:01:16.166 --> 01:01:17.375
There was a strange confusion.

01:01:17.875 --> 01:01:20.916
Actually...the boy Ranjana loves is your son.

01:01:21.416 --> 01:01:24.333
Ajay.

01:01:24.833 --> 01:01:26.416
Oh...

01:01:26.916 --> 01:01:29.541
This is truly amazing.

01:01:30.041 --> 01:01:36.166
Like I said...your sister can never choose a wrong guy.

01:01:36.666 --> 01:01:37.958
Let me introduce you.

01:01:38.458 --> 01:01:39.166
This is Majnu.

01:01:39.666 --> 01:01:43.083
My friend, business partner, brother, companion... Everything!

01:01:43.583 --> 01:01:48.541
"Majnu bhai.."

01:01:49.041 --> 01:01:49.958
Ghunghroo... - Yes.

01:01:50.458 --> 01:01:53.291
You were talking too much today. - It was nothing.

01:01:53.791 --> 01:01:56.458
Nothing. You even involved my father.

01:01:56.958 --> 01:01:58.333
I was tensed. - Tensed?

01:01:58.833 --> 01:02:02.333
Do you know what happens when the bull charges at you?

01:02:09.416 --> 01:02:11.916
This time...

01:02:12.416 --> 01:02:13.625
You can't even light a lighter.

01:02:14.125 --> 01:02:17.625
How will you fire a gun?

01:02:30.208 --> 01:02:32.791
Practice.

01:02:33.291 --> 01:02:36.791
College...knowledge.

01:02:45.958 --> 01:02:48.666
What? You don't get the boy?

01:02:49.166 --> 01:02:49.958
What are you saying?

01:02:50.458 --> 01:02:52.208
Ghunghroo's family is so decent.

01:02:52.708 --> 01:02:57.041
Even the flies in his house have hover decently.

01:02:57.541 --> 01:03:02.125
Ajay's over-smart gait.

01:03:02.625 --> 01:03:06.375
Raising his hand while meeting.

01:03:06.875 --> 01:03:10.666
Lighting a matchstick like this.

01:03:11.166 --> 01:03:13.000
Normally people from our profession do these things.

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:17.708
Boss, these days college kids have become more stylish than us.

01:03:18.208 --> 01:03:19.416
Right. - It's become a fashion.

01:03:19.916 --> 01:03:22.416
Yes, Majnu sir. You doubt him for no reason.

01:03:22.916 --> 01:03:26.791
Exactly. Ranjana's getting engaged.

01:03:27.291 --> 01:03:29.250
Let's go, we've much to do. Come on.

01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:33.250
Let's go.

01:03:43.125 --> 01:03:45.291
Smile...this is not a funeral.

01:03:45.791 --> 01:03:47.833
It's as good as a funeral for me.

01:03:48.333 --> 01:03:49.291
After Ranjana's engagement..

01:03:49.791 --> 01:03:53.000
..both the brothers will trouble me again.

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:55.541
There he is. - All fine?

01:03:56.041 --> 01:03:56.750
How am I looking?

01:03:57.250 --> 01:03:57.666
Very nice.

01:03:58.166 --> 01:04:01.458
Come. Let me introduce me to Ranjana's fianc.

01:04:01.958 --> 01:04:04.833
You better explain that rascal Majnu.

01:04:05.333 --> 01:04:06.625
I am explaining him. - Good

01:04:07.125 --> 01:04:09.625
Ajay!

01:04:10.125 --> 01:04:11.916
What happened? - Nothing.

01:04:12.416 --> 01:04:14.833
Ajay...Queen Padmavati.

01:04:15.333 --> 01:04:17.666
Princess of Nazabgarh...Chandni.

01:04:18.166 --> 01:04:18.875
Boss... - Huh!

01:04:19.375 --> 01:04:21.458
Sheikh sir's here. - Okay.

01:04:21.958 --> 01:04:22.083
Okay.

01:04:22.583 --> 01:04:26.083
Come on.

01:04:29.083 --> 01:04:30.958
"Hey Sheila-Munni."

01:04:31.458 --> 01:04:33.458
"Does he look like bread to you?"

01:04:33.958 --> 01:04:35.375
"Then why were you buttering him?"

01:04:35.875 --> 01:04:37.333
Hare Krishna! Hare Krishna.. - Quiet.

01:04:37.833 --> 01:04:38.666
"Quietly shell out all the money you looted.."

01:04:39.166 --> 01:04:41.250
"..under the pretext of marrying him."

01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:45.750
"When Ajju resorts to violence, he doesn't care about gender."

01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:46.666
"Right?"

01:04:47.166 --> 01:04:49.583
"Son...give us one day's time."

01:04:50.083 --> 01:04:51.541
We meet after a long time.

01:04:52.041 --> 01:04:54.791
We wouldn't have met today either, Ajju bhai.

01:04:55.291 --> 01:04:56.166
Ajay!

01:04:56.666 --> 01:04:59.833
If you tell anyone about me.. - Why would we?

01:05:00.333 --> 01:05:01.666
We don't want our secrets revealed either.

01:05:02.166 --> 01:05:05.666
Yes... - We don't.

01:05:08.625 --> 01:05:10.041
Uday sir...

01:05:10.541 --> 01:05:12.083
Shall we start with the rituals? - Of course. - Come on.

01:05:12.583 --> 01:05:16.083
Ajay, come on. - Wait a minute.

01:05:35.625 --> 01:05:37.166
Majnu, where were you?

01:05:37.666 --> 01:05:41.250
Preparing for the groom's send-off.

01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:43.875
But that only happens at the wedding.

01:05:44.375 --> 01:05:45.958
This is just the engagement. Didn't anyone tell you?

01:05:46.458 --> 01:05:48.708
We weren't told a number of things...Samadhi ji

01:05:49.208 --> 01:05:50.750
No... it's Samdhi.

01:05:51.250 --> 01:05:53.041
Slip of tongue.

01:05:53.541 --> 01:05:57.041
Because that's going to be your future.

01:05:57.541 --> 01:06:02.125
Uday...you're mistaking him for a decent boy..

01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:04.541
..but in reality he's Mumbai's biggest goon.

01:06:05.041 --> 01:06:08.541
Ajju bhai!

01:06:13.375 --> 01:06:14.666
"Majnu bhai."

01:06:15.166 --> 01:06:18.666
Kapoor!

01:06:25.958 --> 01:06:29.458
Tell us this decent rascal's history.

01:06:32.958 --> 01:06:36.208
Don't be scared, you're with Majnu now.

01:06:36.708 --> 01:06:37.916
This is Ajju bhai.

01:06:38.416 --> 01:06:40.250
Mumbai Police's biggest headache.

01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:42.625
Riots...vandalism...

01:06:43.125 --> 01:06:46.625
Ransom, Extortion, money-laundering, Illegal-possession

01:07:05.416 --> 01:07:06.583
Did you hear?

01:07:07.083 --> 01:07:10.583
And most importantly... he isn't even his son.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.291
You said even the flies at Ghunghroo's home are decent.

01:07:22.791 --> 01:07:26.458
Now do you see what kind of family... and insects they really are?

01:07:26.958 --> 01:07:28.833
Majnu, please listen to me..

01:07:29.333 --> 01:07:31.000
The Lord's blessed us with two ears and one mouth.

01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:33.041
So talk less and hear more.

01:07:33.541 --> 01:07:37.333
Majnu...please talk to me. - Shut up.

01:07:37.833 --> 01:07:41.333
Not a word more, or I will kill you.

01:07:45.833 --> 01:07:46.916
What did you say?

01:07:47.416 --> 01:07:47.708
What?

01:07:48.208 --> 01:07:50.083
Forget the rhyme, concentrate on the cusswords.

01:07:50.583 --> 01:07:52.208
You made me concentrate on the cusswords..

01:07:52.708 --> 01:07:55.916
..and failed to concentrate on your son.

01:07:56.416 --> 01:08:00.250
You want to let our innocent sister marry this goon.

01:08:00.750 --> 01:08:04.000
You want to ruin her life and our respect.

01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:06.250
Boss, is your gun loaded.

01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:09.458
There's a huge crowd gathered here, what can I do?

01:08:09.958 --> 01:08:10.833
Don't do anything.

01:08:11.333 --> 01:08:11.583
Control.

01:08:12.083 --> 01:08:13.708
He's completely changed now, he's become descent.

01:08:14.208 --> 01:08:17.832
We couldn't reform yet, you think he can.

01:08:18.332 --> 01:08:22.041
Control. Majnu...control.

01:08:22.541 --> 01:08:24.457
We're Uday-Majnu.

01:08:24.957 --> 01:08:26.207
Uday-Majnu.

01:08:26.707 --> 01:08:29.207
We've done everything that's evil.

01:08:29.707 --> 01:08:31.332
And you want to outsmart us.

01:08:31.832 --> 01:08:34.416
He's humiliating them, that's okay..

01:08:34.916 --> 01:08:36.666
..but why is he humiliating us as well?

01:08:37.166 --> 01:08:38.416
Listen to.. - Get lost.

01:08:38.916 --> 01:08:39.666
Listen to me... - Get out.

01:08:40.166 --> 01:08:40.791
Listen to me.. - Get lost...

01:08:41.291 --> 01:08:43.166
Listen to...

01:08:43.666 --> 01:08:45.332
Hey!

01:08:45.832 --> 01:08:49.332
He's my father!

01:08:51.041 --> 01:08:54.082
And I am yours.

01:08:54.582 --> 01:08:57.375
If you touch him again, I'll break your arm later..

01:08:57.875 --> 01:09:00.125
..and rip it off first.

01:09:00.625 --> 01:09:04.125
Bloody...street thug, don't forget..

01:09:04.625 --> 01:09:05.875
..we just recently turned decent.

01:09:06.375 --> 01:09:08.957
But before this I was a goon too. - You were...

01:09:09.457 --> 01:09:10.832
But I still am one.

01:09:11.332 --> 01:09:15.957
And this bloody fool...couldn't describe what a big goon I really am.

01:09:16.457 --> 01:09:18.500
Go to Mumbai and ask anyone.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.707
I've more cases than the number of local trains.

01:09:23.207 --> 01:09:24.500
And tell me one thing..

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.832
His mobile...my sim.

01:09:28.332 --> 01:09:31.707
Who are you to give a miss call?

01:09:32.207 --> 01:09:36.666
His sister...my love... who are you to interfere?

01:09:37.166 --> 01:09:39.125
I am her brother as well.

01:09:39.625 --> 01:09:40.207
Majnu.

01:09:40.707 --> 01:09:43.500
All these bloody Majnu's get stoned in the end.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.082
You can't find a Juliet for yourself..

01:09:45.582 --> 01:09:49.500
..and now you want to interfere with the one I am getting.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.082
Till today... I got everything I wanted.

01:09:53.582 --> 01:09:56.666
And now your sister dwells in my heart.

01:09:57.166 --> 01:09:58.541
Whether we get engaged or not..

01:09:59.041 --> 01:10:02.208
..but she will get married, with only me.

01:10:02.708 --> 01:10:06.125
End of story!

01:10:06.625 --> 01:10:08.291
What are you all waiting for?

01:10:08.791 --> 01:10:12.291
Throw this rascal out.

01:10:56.583 --> 01:10:58.291
I told you not to turn decent.

01:10:58.791 --> 01:11:02.291
Now you'll have to pay.

01:11:32.166 --> 01:11:35.666
I know 2006 ways to break 206 bones.

01:12:02.666 --> 01:12:08.250
Whether you're a blood-brother or distant.

01:12:08.750 --> 01:12:12.250
I'll rip anyone apart that tries to interfere with my love.

01:12:19.333 --> 01:12:22.833
You made pigeons sit on decent people, didn't you?

01:12:30.458 --> 01:12:32.416
But I am not that decent.

01:12:32.916 --> 01:12:34.125
"Ajju bhai."

01:12:34.625 --> 01:12:36.500
Those who mess with me...

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:37.916
...I rip him apart.

01:12:38.416 --> 01:12:40.666
"Ajju bhai."

01:12:41.166 --> 01:12:45.583
You can't imagine what will be sitting on your heads?

01:12:46.083 --> 01:12:47.041
What?

01:12:47.541 --> 01:12:51.041
What?

01:13:27.208 --> 01:13:29.333
Look, crow.

01:13:29.833 --> 01:13:33.333
Crow...Crowww...

01:13:47.791 --> 01:13:51.291
Control

01:13:54.625 --> 01:13:58.125
Control Uday.

01:14:31.083 --> 01:14:34.583
Control.

01:14:36.708 --> 01:14:38.416
Control

01:14:38.916 --> 01:14:41.791
Majnu...now Uday isn't confused anymore.

01:14:42.291 --> 01:14:43.625
You were absolutely right.

01:14:44.125 --> 01:14:45.791
Decency is like a bubble.

01:14:46.291 --> 01:14:48.916
It has no value. It's worth nothing.

01:14:49.416 --> 01:14:50.125
What's wrong, boss?

01:14:50.625 --> 01:14:52.458
I got excited after a long time..

01:14:52.958 --> 01:14:54.333
..so I got a catch in my body.

01:14:54.833 --> 01:14:56.958
There are only two things this world values.

01:14:57.458 --> 01:15:02.083
Property...and rascals!

01:15:02.583 --> 01:15:05.541
I thought I'll make do with words, not bullets..

01:15:06.041 --> 01:15:09.000
..and buried my guns, but it's time to get them out now.

01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:11.916
I knew we'll need them.

01:15:12.416 --> 01:15:14.708
Hey...did you get the weapons?

01:15:15.208 --> 01:15:16.791
I found the bullets, but still looking for the guns.

01:15:17.291 --> 01:15:18.791
Hurry up...hurry up.

01:15:19.291 --> 01:15:22.666
That bloody novice made crows sit on us.

01:15:23.166 --> 01:15:27.375
Now we'll make those crows sit at his oblation.

01:15:27.875 --> 01:15:28.625
We'll give him salvation.

01:15:29.125 --> 01:15:29.916
That's more like it.

01:15:30.416 --> 01:15:32.583
Hey...did you find the guns? - Yes, I did.

01:15:33.083 --> 01:15:34.458
I even found some missiles, should I take them along too.

01:15:34.958 --> 01:15:36.458
Why don't you take the tank along too?

01:15:36.958 --> 01:15:40.375
We're going to kill Ajju, not attack Israel.

01:15:40.875 --> 01:15:42.208
He even took my favorite goggle.

01:15:42.708 --> 01:15:45.083
Uday...Majnu.

01:15:45.583 --> 01:15:47.250
You two didn't tell me..

01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:49.083
..that you're related to Ajju bhai.

01:15:49.583 --> 01:15:53.208
How can Badshah Khan take money from Ajju's brothers-in-law.

01:15:53.708 --> 01:15:55.208
Hey fatso...

01:15:55.708 --> 01:15:58.375
We've no relation with Ajju anymore.

01:15:58.875 --> 01:15:59.916
We've broken all ties.

01:16:00.416 --> 01:16:03.291
What? You broke it off, not him.

01:16:03.791 --> 01:16:04.958
This is all good if he breaks it.

01:16:05.458 --> 01:16:07.458
And he only breaks bones.

01:16:07.958 --> 01:16:10.000
Whether it's the Ace of spades... and Ajju's punch..

01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:12.500
..both mean game over.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.625
Don't lock horns with him.

01:16:15.125 --> 01:16:17.750
Go fall at his feet and apologies.

01:16:18.250 --> 01:16:20.250
And you do remember where the feet are, don't you? It's this.

01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:23.083
And don't let go until he doesn't forgive you.

01:16:23.583 --> 01:16:25.541
Uday...Uday...Uday... you're the sensible one.

01:16:26.041 --> 01:16:26.541
You've got brains.

01:16:27.041 --> 01:16:29.041
You know, if he doesn't forgive you..

01:16:29.541 --> 01:16:35.083
..he'll rip Uday and Shetty apart.

01:16:35.583 --> 01:16:38.000
Where's everyone?

01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:42.000
Right behind you!

01:16:49.791 --> 01:16:51.041
Stop these fools.

01:16:51.541 --> 01:16:54.375
If they die, we won't get any more credit.

01:16:54.875 --> 01:16:57.125
Stupid fools want to wage a war at the age of dying their hair. Rascals...

01:16:57.625 --> 01:16:58.375
Come, dear.

01:16:58.875 --> 01:17:00.541
You called them, didn't you?

01:17:01.041 --> 01:17:02.083
Where are you two going to die?

01:17:02.583 --> 01:17:05.708
See...they've already made up their mind.. - That we'll die.

01:17:06.208 --> 01:17:07.875
Yes. If Ajju hits you, you two will be dead.

01:17:08.375 --> 01:17:09.583
And if you two kill Ajju..

01:17:10.083 --> 01:17:13.666
..you'll either be sentenced to death or imprisoned for life.

01:17:14.166 --> 01:17:18.625
At this age, life imprisonment is as good as death sentence.

01:17:19.125 --> 01:17:19.958
Did you two ever think..

01:17:20.458 --> 01:17:22.458
..what will happen to me after you're dead?

01:17:22.958 --> 01:17:24.166
What's wrong with you two?

01:17:24.666 --> 01:17:26.041
You're so decent and sensible..

01:17:26.541 --> 01:17:28.208
..and want to fight that petty goon Ajju.

01:17:28.708 --> 01:17:30.875
When a decent man's honor is at stake..

01:17:31.375 --> 01:17:33.375
..then he's the biggest goon of all.

01:17:33.875 --> 01:17:35.166
I told you to get the car.

01:17:35.666 --> 01:17:37.208
I will slap you.. - Go get it.

01:17:37.708 --> 01:17:39.958
Stop these fools, mom.

01:17:40.458 --> 01:17:43.791
Fine, go on. My daughter will face her fate.

01:17:44.291 --> 01:17:45.583
But did you ever think..

01:17:46.083 --> 01:17:48.541
..what will happen to your sister after you two?

01:17:49.041 --> 01:17:52.375
Uday, God has blessed you with everything.

01:17:52.875 --> 01:17:55.625
But what does your sister have...except for you?

01:17:56.125 --> 01:18:00.208
Use your brains instead of using your hands and legs.

01:18:00.708 --> 01:18:03.583
And strike at Ajju's heart.

01:18:04.083 --> 01:18:07.583
When you can kill him with sugar, why give him poison?

01:18:13.166 --> 01:18:15.250
They fixed your marriage with someone else!

01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:16.333
I will kill those two.

01:18:16.833 --> 01:18:17.541
End of problems. - Ajju..

01:18:18.041 --> 01:18:19.125
Fine. Kill them.

01:18:19.625 --> 01:18:21.750
So that there's no difference between you and them.

01:18:22.250 --> 01:18:24.291
So will you marry the guy they chose for you?

01:18:24.791 --> 01:18:28.916
I would prefer to die first. - Dear!

01:18:29.416 --> 01:18:31.750
I think there's only one option left.

01:18:32.250 --> 01:18:33.208
You two should elope and get married.

01:18:33.708 --> 01:18:38.375
No, uncle. I cannot humiliate my brothers.

01:18:38.875 --> 01:18:42.125
I will get married only with their consent.

01:18:42.625 --> 01:18:44.208
Look, dear. They would prefer to die..

01:18:44.708 --> 01:18:47.416
..rather than giving their consent willingly.

01:18:47.916 --> 01:18:49.125
Don't worry.

01:18:49.625 --> 01:18:52.041
You will either marry me or no one.

01:18:52.541 --> 01:18:53.125
How?

01:18:53.625 --> 01:18:55.875
To prevent any complications in the marriage from your side..

01:18:56.375 --> 01:18:59.250
..Uday and Majnu have gone to invite some Wanted bhai.

01:18:59.750 --> 01:19:00.625
What?

01:19:01.125 --> 01:19:02.208
Wanted bhai.

01:19:02.708 --> 01:19:08.333
Pa...why are you shocked to hear about Wanted bhai.

01:19:08.833 --> 01:19:12.333
I was shocked when I first heard the name of RDX.

01:19:23.666 --> 01:19:25.375
But after hearing about Wanted..

01:19:25.875 --> 01:19:29.041
..I feel like someone shoved an electric pole down my...

01:19:29.541 --> 01:19:33.625
You don't know Wanted bhai!

01:19:34.125 --> 01:19:37.625
Wanted bhai!

01:19:44.416 --> 01:19:47.458
"Wanted bhai!"

01:19:47.958 --> 01:19:51.458
"Wanted bhai!"

01:20:14.416 --> 01:20:17.500
"Welcome... - Wanted bhai!"

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.083
"Wanted bhai!"

01:20:19.583 --> 01:20:20.916
Welcome...Welcome...

01:20:21.416 --> 01:20:23.500
Uday-Majnu.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.333
How did you know it's us?

01:20:26.833 --> 01:20:27.875
This is my island, not America..

01:20:28.375 --> 01:20:35.416
..where anyone can come in without permission.

01:20:35.916 --> 01:20:37.041
And secondly..

01:20:37.541 --> 01:20:46.166
You two still use that cheap perfume that's available at the flea market.

01:20:46.666 --> 01:20:50.166
Yes...

01:20:53.666 --> 01:20:58.583
Bhai...people like us hardly hit the target.

01:20:59.083 --> 01:21:02.583
But he never misses.

01:21:16.708 --> 01:21:19.458
I hate to lose.

01:21:19.958 --> 01:21:23.166
So...what brings you two here?

01:21:23.666 --> 01:21:25.333
We came here to give you the wedding card.

01:21:25.833 --> 01:21:28.333
Wedding? - Not us.

01:21:28.833 --> 01:21:30.583
I was wondering...

01:21:31.083 --> 01:21:36.000
...who decided to buy these two old ruins?

01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:40.250
That was a joke. Joke.

01:21:40.750 --> 01:21:43.625
Majnu sir... ask him about this hole.

01:21:44.125 --> 01:21:47.208
Common sense, Majnu... common sense..

01:21:47.708 --> 01:21:49.708
...which is not so common.

01:21:50.208 --> 01:21:50.750
Did you hear?

01:21:51.250 --> 01:21:53.166
Get lost.

01:21:53.666 --> 01:21:54.875
Oh no...Honey!

01:21:55.375 --> 01:21:55.750
Leave me.

01:21:56.250 --> 01:21:59.750
What did this boy do now? - Let go.

01:22:03.541 --> 01:22:04.833
Honey.

01:22:05.333 --> 01:22:05.875
No...no...

01:22:06.375 --> 01:22:07.291
Honey.

01:22:07.791 --> 01:22:10.625
Son...not again...

01:22:11.125 --> 01:22:13.666
Bloody fools...I told you to keep him away from drugs.

01:22:14.166 --> 01:22:16.416
You useless bloody..

01:22:16.916 --> 01:22:17.833
Honey...son.

01:22:18.333 --> 01:22:20.416
What else can I do?

01:22:20.916 --> 01:22:22.916
You can't fulfill one single wish of your son.

01:22:23.416 --> 01:22:24.125
I.. - I hate you!

01:22:24.625 --> 01:22:26.791
I hate you!

01:22:27.291 --> 01:22:30.583
Honey.. - I hate you!

01:22:31.083 --> 01:22:34.416
Why is Honey so angry with you?

01:22:34.916 --> 01:22:37.541
What wish didn't you fulfill?

01:22:38.041 --> 01:22:42.666
I'm prepared to give my life for his every desire.

01:22:43.166 --> 01:22:46.416
But this time I looked everywhere to fulfill his wish..

01:22:46.916 --> 01:22:50.541
..but couldn't find her anywhere.

01:22:51.041 --> 01:22:54.583
Is it...some new drug? - Not a drug.

01:22:55.083 --> 01:22:59.541
His love...his madness.

01:23:00.041 --> 01:23:02.083
Since he saw that girl..

01:23:02.583 --> 01:23:07.041
..he keeps painting his pictures like a madman.

01:23:07.541 --> 01:23:10.166
Honey is a painter?

01:23:10.666 --> 01:23:12.375
Yes. Why?

01:23:12.875 --> 01:23:14.000
Good.

01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:17.208
Good to know, I am a painter too.

01:23:17.708 --> 01:23:20.541
Sir...Honey sir cut his veins.

01:23:21.041 --> 01:23:21.916
Call the doctor!

01:23:22.416 --> 01:23:25.958
Call the doctor!

01:23:26.458 --> 01:23:27.208
Honey.

01:23:27.708 --> 01:23:29.208
Honey, my son.

01:23:29.708 --> 01:23:30.791
What have you done?

01:23:31.291 --> 01:23:33.458
You're my world, son, I won't let anything happen to you.

01:23:33.958 --> 01:23:36.666
She's my world, dad.

01:23:37.166 --> 01:23:40.666
She's my world.

01:23:43.875 --> 01:23:47.625
This girl that's in your paintings..

01:23:48.125 --> 01:23:53.458
..I will soon make her your reality, son.

01:23:53.958 --> 01:24:00.916
Not just her, I'll abduct her entire family, in fact the entire city.

01:24:01.416 --> 01:24:02.958
She will marry only you, son.

01:24:03.458 --> 01:24:06.958
Every drop of your blood will become the vermillion on her forehead.

01:24:15.833 --> 01:24:16.708
We came here to hit the final nail..

01:24:17.208 --> 01:24:18.166
..but the hammer fell on our head instead.

01:24:18.666 --> 01:24:19.958
On one side is that goon Ajju..

01:24:20.458 --> 01:24:22.791
..and on the other side is that Wanted's junkie son Honey.

01:24:23.291 --> 01:24:25.416
At any cost, we won't let Ranjana marry this junkie.

01:24:25.916 --> 01:24:28.375
All the problems are in your family's weddings.

01:24:28.875 --> 01:24:30.041
What's my fault?

01:24:30.541 --> 01:24:32.250
My father fulfilled the quota for marriages in our family.

01:24:32.750 --> 01:24:34.000
And I'm running around with his kids.

01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:36.125
And seems like my sister won't get married either.

01:24:36.625 --> 01:24:37.583
We'll get her married as soon as we land.

01:24:38.083 --> 01:24:38.708
And send her off.

01:24:39.208 --> 01:24:40.125
The rituals can be performed later.

01:24:40.625 --> 01:24:41.250
And listen up.

01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:43.291
No one should know about this.

01:24:43.791 --> 01:24:46.583
We swear we won't tell anyone. - Let's go. Come on.

01:24:47.083 --> 01:24:49.041
"Welcome."

01:24:49.541 --> 01:24:51.791
"Welcome."

01:24:52.291 --> 01:24:55.791
"Welcome. Welcome. Welcome."

01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:10.458
Thank you...thank you.

01:25:10.958 --> 01:25:12.083
Majnu, God's blessed me with everything

01:25:12.583 --> 01:25:13.791
Fame, fortune, honor...

01:25:14.291 --> 01:25:15.208
And the groom's decent too.

01:25:15.708 --> 01:25:16.833
Once my sister gets married without any problems..

01:25:17.333 --> 01:25:17.958
..I will take a skinny dip.

01:25:18.458 --> 01:25:19.166
You mean take a dip in Ganga.

01:25:19.666 --> 01:25:21.375
We both will take a dip and drown those two.

01:25:21.875 --> 01:25:22.458
Yes.

01:25:22.958 --> 01:25:25.541
Who? - That bull and the blind.

01:25:26.041 --> 01:25:27.083
Wanted and Ajju.

01:25:27.583 --> 01:25:29.333
Don't mention those two rascals.

01:25:29.833 --> 01:25:32.916
Forget them.

01:25:33.416 --> 01:25:36.458
"Wanted bhai."

01:25:36.958 --> 01:25:37.833
"Wanted bhai."

01:25:38.333 --> 01:25:41.833
Wanted.

01:25:45.875 --> 01:25:47.875
"Welcome.. - Wanted bhai."

01:25:48.375 --> 01:25:49.125
Wanted sir.

01:25:49.625 --> 01:25:50.333
Welcome. - Welcome.

01:25:50.833 --> 01:25:52.291
Your sister's getting married..

01:25:52.791 --> 01:25:56.291
..and you forgot to invite the groom.

01:26:00.250 --> 01:26:02.041
It was a joke. Joke.

01:26:02.541 --> 01:26:03.208
Joke.

01:26:03.708 --> 01:26:07.500
But the truth is Honey will soon get married too.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:08.125
I see.

01:26:08.625 --> 01:26:09.208
We were informed that..

01:26:09.708 --> 01:26:16.500
..he's going to find the love of his life in this wedding.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:17.833
Find the girl?

01:26:18.333 --> 01:26:21.833
Who told you? - My new friend did.

01:26:33.750 --> 01:26:37.250
No, boss.

01:26:46.208 --> 01:26:51.375
Madam, I.. - You told Ajju that Wanted's son loves Ranjana as well.

01:26:51.875 --> 01:26:54.000
No. - Shut up.

01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:56.375
What a way to stop the marriage.

01:26:56.875 --> 01:27:03.166
Your moves are better than those on the chessboard.

01:27:03.666 --> 01:27:05.166
Why did you decorate the place?

01:27:05.666 --> 01:27:06.791
Is someone getting married?

01:27:07.291 --> 01:27:09.375
We didn't decorate this place for dancing.

01:27:09.875 --> 01:27:11.208
I asked because I don't see the bride and groom anywhere.

01:27:11.708 --> 01:27:12.333
You will...you will.

01:27:12.833 --> 01:27:14.958
The wedding procession will arrive soon.

01:27:15.458 --> 01:27:17.166
Will the bride arrive with the guests?

01:27:17.666 --> 01:27:19.458
She must be right here, isn't it?

01:27:19.958 --> 01:27:21.083
So not get her blessed by this fuse bulb..

01:27:21.583 --> 01:27:23.041
I mean Wanted Bhai.

01:27:23.541 --> 01:27:26.250
Where is the girl? - There she is.

01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:28.375
Majnu.

01:27:28.875 --> 01:27:29.250
Come.

01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:31.375
Let me introduce you to the guests.

01:27:32.208 --> 01:27:33.958
Ranjana, that Ajju. - I know..

01:27:34.458 --> 01:27:35.458
Ajju is such a rascal.

01:27:35.958 --> 01:27:38.083
He brought Wanted and Honey here to spoil the wedding.

01:27:38.583 --> 01:27:39.875
I should cover my face, right? - Yes.

01:27:40.375 --> 01:27:43.333
You do that.

01:27:43.833 --> 01:27:46.083
Now watch the fun.

01:27:46.583 --> 01:27:48.000
What's wrong, sir?

01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:51.250
We're heading in the wrong direction.

01:27:51.750 --> 01:27:56.291
The fragrance is coming from this side.

01:27:56.791 --> 01:27:58.875
Come. - The blind guy's coming here.

01:27:59.375 --> 01:28:01.375
This is the queen of...Nazabgarh.

01:28:01.875 --> 01:28:02.625
How do you do?

01:28:03.125 --> 01:28:05.250
And he is.. - Everyone knows him.

01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:07.458
Wanted sir, this is Chandni. - Hello.

01:28:07.958 --> 01:28:08.333
My daughter.

01:28:08.833 --> 01:28:12.208
My... - I mean mine.

01:28:12.708 --> 01:28:15.625
I was wondering, I haven't gone hunting for a long time..

01:28:16.125 --> 01:28:19.125
..so who fired the gun.

01:28:19.625 --> 01:28:22.625
It was a joke. Joke.

01:28:23.125 --> 01:28:24.000
There's still time.

01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:26.250
The decoration's the same, so are the guests.

01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:28.125
Just change the groom, what say?

01:28:28.625 --> 01:28:32.125
B****

01:28:33.333 --> 01:28:34.833
Here comes Ranjana.

01:28:35.333 --> 01:28:38.166
Judging by her long veil..

01:28:38.666 --> 01:28:41.041
..it's even longer than the curtains on our windows.

01:28:41.541 --> 01:28:42.250
No, it's our tradition.

01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:43.541
And we've another tradition.

01:28:44.041 --> 01:28:46.375
Only the groom gets to take the veil of after the wedding.

01:28:46.875 --> 01:28:48.416
Ohh...

01:28:48.916 --> 01:28:52.416
Then I'll have to do something about this tradition.

01:29:00.541 --> 01:29:04.041
"The wedding trumpets are blaring."

01:29:07.541 --> 01:29:10.291
"The wedding trumpets are blaring."

01:29:10.791 --> 01:29:13.708
"The damsel's hiding behind the veil."

01:29:14.208 --> 01:29:16.625
"And she's stolen my heart."

01:29:17.125 --> 01:29:23.708
"The sweet sound of your bracelets."

01:29:24.208 --> 01:29:27.125
"The sweet sound of your bracelets."

01:29:27.625 --> 01:29:30.875
"Makes me hover around you, sweetheart."

01:29:31.375 --> 01:29:35.500
"The wedding drums are resonating.."

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.708
"..all around, sweetheart."

01:29:38.208 --> 01:29:41.000
"My eyes have locked with yours."

01:29:41.500 --> 01:29:45.000
"Everyone says this couple's perfect."

01:29:50.875 --> 01:29:54.375
"The wedding trumpets are blaring."

01:29:57.875 --> 01:30:01.375
"The wedding trumpets are blaring."

01:30:14.333 --> 01:30:19.958
"My earrings...tinkle only for you."

01:30:20.458 --> 01:30:27.708
"My heart's grown sentimental...only for you."

01:30:28.208 --> 01:30:33.750
"Since we met...everyone else was jealous."

01:30:34.250 --> 01:30:42.083
"Since we got together... everyone was against me."

01:30:42.583 --> 01:30:43.916
"Stop flirting with the girl."

01:30:44.416 --> 01:30:45.666
"Put a full stop on your love."

01:30:46.166 --> 01:30:48.958
"Romance has ruined many lives."

01:30:49.458 --> 01:30:51.125
"We're drunk to the core."

01:30:51.625 --> 01:30:52.708
"If you take this any further."

01:30:53.208 --> 01:30:55.250
"We'll teach you a lesson."

01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:59.250
"And you'll enjoy it."

01:31:02.208 --> 01:31:05.708
"The wedding trumpets are blaring."

01:31:09.250 --> 01:31:12.750
"The wedding trumpets are blaring."

01:31:25.958 --> 01:31:28.000
It was a joke.

01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:32.000
Just a joke.

01:31:33.125 --> 01:31:36.250
"There's a uproar all around."

01:31:36.750 --> 01:31:38.500
"You make me complete."

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:43.041
"You're the one for me."

01:31:43.541 --> 01:31:46.458
"You announced to the world."

01:31:46.958 --> 01:31:52.958
"My first romantic flick...is a hit."

01:31:53.458 --> 01:31:54.916
"Your love is filmy."

01:31:55.416 --> 01:31:56.666
"Don't take such risks."

01:31:57.166 --> 01:32:00.000
"You don't know what your climax is."

01:32:00.500 --> 01:32:01.916
"Stop blowing the trumpet."

01:32:02.416 --> 01:32:03.625
"We will never give you green signal."

01:32:04.125 --> 01:32:06.125
"Park your car on the side."

01:32:06.625 --> 01:32:10.125
"Move aside."

01:32:13.250 --> 01:32:16.750
"The wedding trumpets are blaring."

01:32:20.166 --> 01:32:23.666
"The wedding trumpets are blaring."

01:32:27.125 --> 01:32:28.791
"The wedding trumpets are blaring."

01:32:29.291 --> 01:32:31.333
"The wedding trumpets are blaring."

01:32:31.833 --> 01:32:34.583
"The wedding trumpets are blaring."

01:32:35.083 --> 01:32:38.583
"The wedding trumpets are blaring."

01:33:12.666 --> 01:33:13.958
"The wedding trumpets are blaring."

01:33:14.458 --> 01:33:15.416
"The wedding trumpets are blaring."

01:33:15.916 --> 01:33:17.083
"The wedding trumpets are blaring."

01:33:17.583 --> 01:33:18.625
"The wedding trumpets are blaring."

01:33:19.125 --> 01:33:20.291
"The wedding trumpets are blaring."

01:33:20.791 --> 01:33:22.000
"The wedding trumpets are blaring."

01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:23.458
"The wedding trumpets are blaring."

01:33:23.958 --> 01:33:27.666
"The wedding trumpets are blaring."

01:33:28.166 --> 01:33:31.666
Take everyone to our island.

01:34:11.833 --> 01:34:12.958
Honey, my son.

01:34:13.458 --> 01:34:15.458
Your birthday's on the 13th.

01:34:15.958 --> 01:34:17.083
And I've decided that..

01:34:17.583 --> 01:34:20.000
..you and Ranjana will get engaged on the same day.

01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:24.333
Dad. You are the greatest dad.

01:34:24.833 --> 01:34:26.958
Thank you so much, dad. I love you.

01:34:27.458 --> 01:34:31.583
This engagement isn't possible!

01:34:32.083 --> 01:34:33.333
What did you say?

01:34:33.833 --> 01:34:35.791
I didn't hear you clearly.

01:34:36.291 --> 01:34:37.875
Brother said this engagement isn't possible.

01:34:38.375 --> 01:34:44.083
Majnu...Uday, this isn't your engagement.

01:34:44.583 --> 01:34:46.458
This is my son's engagement.

01:34:46.958 --> 01:34:48.666
This engagement isn't possible because he's your son.

01:34:49.166 --> 01:34:49.291
Uday!

01:34:49.791 --> 01:34:53.291
They'll directly get married.

01:34:55.958 --> 01:34:58.875
Your son loves our sister.

01:34:59.375 --> 01:35:01.416
It's not right to make lovers suffer for so long.

01:35:01.916 --> 01:35:03.166
You made me really happy, Uday.

01:35:03.666 --> 01:35:05.583
For a second I thought you're against dad's decision.

01:35:06.083 --> 01:35:11.833
Yes...I was already seeing a lot of dead bodies before the engagement.

01:35:12.333 --> 01:35:15.791
Joke...it was a joke.

01:35:16.291 --> 01:35:17.916
Uday.

01:35:18.416 --> 01:35:21.916
Congratulation Uday

01:35:34.583 --> 01:35:36.208
What did you do, Uday?

01:35:36.708 --> 01:35:37.791
You've lost your mind.

01:35:38.291 --> 01:35:40.875
Yes, I wanted to teach that Ajju a lesson.

01:35:41.375 --> 01:35:43.416
It's your ego... your obstinacy.

01:35:43.916 --> 01:35:46.458
You're ruining Ranjana's life. - Yes, it is my obstinacy.

01:35:46.958 --> 01:35:48.625
He'll be ruined along with Ranjana.

01:35:49.125 --> 01:35:51.166
You've gone crazy, have you lost your mind.

01:35:51.666 --> 01:35:52.083
Shut up!

01:35:52.583 --> 01:35:54.541
Ranjana is my sister.

01:35:55.041 --> 01:35:56.333
I can take any decision I want.

01:35:56.833 --> 01:35:58.666
Who are you to interfere?

01:35:59.166 --> 01:36:02.916
Who am I? Ranjana's my sister too.

01:36:03.416 --> 01:36:08.833
Don't forget, Majnu can give up his life for the right cause..

01:36:09.333 --> 01:36:11.708
..and even take someone's life.

01:36:12.208 --> 01:36:13.333
You will kill me.

01:36:13.833 --> 01:36:14.708
Me?

01:36:15.208 --> 01:36:17.291
Kill me!

01:36:17.791 --> 01:36:18.750
Kill me!

01:36:19.250 --> 01:36:21.375
Everything is fair in love and war.

01:36:21.875 --> 01:36:24.791
It's his love... and I'm going to wage a war.

01:36:25.291 --> 01:36:27.958
Even if I've to squander everything I have..

01:36:28.458 --> 01:36:30.000
..I won't lose to that Ajju.

01:36:30.500 --> 01:36:34.000
I would rather break, but not bow..

01:36:47.708 --> 01:36:48.083
Where's my phone?

01:36:48.583 --> 01:36:51.000
My phone. - Here..

01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:55.000
Sir. What happened?

01:36:57.833 --> 01:37:00.333
Why are you crying? Get the car! Get the car!

01:37:00.833 --> 01:37:05.375
No point, boss... Uday sir..

01:37:05.875 --> 01:37:07.208
What did you say?

01:37:07.708 --> 01:37:09.708
I'll rip you apart and bury you alive.

01:37:10.208 --> 01:37:12.583
Uday is going to be fine.

01:37:13.083 --> 01:37:13.916
Uday..

01:37:14.416 --> 01:37:15.125
Talk to me.

01:37:15.625 --> 01:37:18.583
I raised my voice... hit me.

01:37:19.083 --> 01:37:20.041
Rip me apart.

01:37:20.541 --> 01:37:21.208
But please get up.

01:37:21.708 --> 01:37:23.083
Get up, Uday. Get up.

01:37:23.583 --> 01:37:28.458
Boss, God's will.. - What God?

01:37:28.958 --> 01:37:32.583
Just because You're God doesn't mean You can do anything..

01:37:33.083 --> 01:37:34.375
..and I'll do nothing.

01:37:34.875 --> 01:37:37.666
I will set the world on fire.

01:37:38.166 --> 01:37:41.291
Burn it down to ashes!

01:37:41.791 --> 01:37:45.166
Uday...get up.

01:37:45.666 --> 01:37:48.416
I've no one in this world except for you.

01:37:48.916 --> 01:37:54.583
Don't leave your Majnu alone.

01:37:55.083 --> 01:37:58.666
We always did everything together.

01:37:59.166 --> 01:38:02.458
And when it was time to go, you left without me.

01:38:02.958 --> 01:38:05.000
This is wrong.

01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:08.125
Absolutely wrong, Uday.

01:38:08.625 --> 01:38:12.125
Absolutely wrong.

01:38:21.125 --> 01:38:24.125
Control, Majnu. Control.

01:38:24.625 --> 01:38:27.041
Uday's voice is still echoing in my ears.

01:38:27.541 --> 01:38:31.041
That's because I am still speaking.

01:38:36.833 --> 01:38:40.750
What joke is this?

01:38:41.250 --> 01:38:43.250
No joke...

01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:44.958
I'll get a similar attack on the wedding.

01:38:45.458 --> 01:38:48.875
What? - I mean...if the brother dies, the sister can't get married.

01:38:49.375 --> 01:38:50.333
Yes...

01:38:50.833 --> 01:38:52.583
The wedding will be postponed for 40 days.

01:38:53.083 --> 01:38:56.458
We're Shettys. We mourn for 1.25 years.

01:38:56.958 --> 01:39:01.500
And during this time, we can take care of many such Wanted bhais.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:02.916
Right, Majnu.

01:39:03.416 --> 01:39:05.166
To hell with Wanted bhai.

01:39:05.666 --> 01:39:08.000
You gave me a big shock today.

01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:09.958
If you ever play such a dirty trick on me again..

01:39:10.458 --> 01:39:12.541
..I will really kill you.

01:39:13.041 --> 01:39:16.458
He's a rascal, but loves me a lot. Right?

01:39:16.958 --> 01:39:18.250
At least now I know..

01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:19.916
..there are few people who'll mourn my death.

01:39:20.416 --> 01:39:23.875
Five... I cried the most.

01:39:24.375 --> 01:39:26.625
He's lying. I cried the most.

01:39:27.125 --> 01:39:29.041
Why? Do you have three eyes.

01:39:29.541 --> 01:39:31.625
Boss, I cried the most.

01:39:32.125 --> 01:39:34.291
Boss, why don't you die for real.

01:39:34.791 --> 01:39:36.333
Then you'll know who cries the most.

01:39:36.833 --> 01:39:39.000
Scoundrels, shut up.

01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:40.916
Be quiet, Uday bhai is alive.

01:39:41.416 --> 01:39:44.333
Now...who's going to die for real? - Ajju.

01:39:44.833 --> 01:39:47.541
You really taught him a good lesson by fixing this marriage.

01:39:48.041 --> 01:39:51.541
Now let's see how he gets married.

01:39:55.583 --> 01:39:59.375
Pretend to love Honey. I can't do that.

01:39:59.875 --> 01:40:02.250
And anyway, I love Uday and Majnu.

01:40:02.750 --> 01:40:03.416
Both of them.

01:40:03.916 --> 01:40:04.791
Why not one more?

01:40:05.291 --> 01:40:07.416
Loving anyone else is a sin.

01:40:07.916 --> 01:40:11.750
Hey...stop this pious act, it's so not you.

01:40:12.250 --> 01:40:15.208
If the police find out that Nazabgarh's princess and queen..

01:40:15.708 --> 01:40:18.791
..are hiding here, do you know what will happen Babita?

01:40:19.291 --> 01:40:20.958
Babita?

01:40:21.458 --> 01:40:21.833
Right, Poonam.

01:40:22.333 --> 01:40:23.958
Poonam?

01:40:24.458 --> 01:40:25.625
Rascal knows our real names.

01:40:26.125 --> 01:40:28.458
Is that your real name?

01:40:28.958 --> 01:40:34.208
Hey...you think your threats can scare us.

01:40:34.708 --> 01:40:37.083
And if you think that, then... you're right.

01:40:37.583 --> 01:40:41.291
We'll do as you say. - You have to.

01:40:41.791 --> 01:40:43.541
And yes...there's not much time.

01:40:44.041 --> 01:40:45.375
Get it done in 24 hours.

01:40:45.875 --> 01:40:48.125
Mom...I can't pretend to love Honey.

01:40:48.625 --> 01:40:51.208
Not at all, we don't have to pretend at all. - Yes.

01:40:51.708 --> 01:40:53.416
We've to really love him.

01:40:53.916 --> 01:40:55.333
The Don's a bigger game.

01:40:55.833 --> 01:40:58.833
He can build another Taj Mahal for you.

01:40:59.333 --> 01:41:01.166
And forget about those Uday and Majnu...

01:41:01.666 --> 01:41:04.416
They've crossed their expiry date. - That they have.

01:41:04.916 --> 01:41:08.875
But mom, you and that Wanted.. - Oh baby, come on.

01:41:09.375 --> 01:41:11.208
Whether Wanted's your father-in-law or father..

01:41:11.708 --> 01:41:13.250
..and Honey becomes your husband or brother..

01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:15.458
..it doesn't make a difference.

01:41:15.958 --> 01:41:19.458
The most important thing is...we should get our hands on the property.

01:41:19.958 --> 01:41:23.916
And remember, if you get Honey, you get Money.

01:41:24.416 --> 01:41:26.250
And when you get the Money...

01:41:26.750 --> 01:41:30.166
Honey's out! - That's my girl.

01:41:30.666 --> 01:41:34.166
Control, Uday...Control!

01:41:42.625 --> 01:41:46.458
What's going on, Uday? - I don't get it either.

01:41:46.958 --> 01:41:49.541
They're kissing, what else.

01:41:50.041 --> 01:41:54.291
That Honey's too much. - No, Honey can't do such a thing.

01:41:54.791 --> 01:41:57.666
Nowadays they are all the same.

01:41:58.166 --> 01:42:01.916
Maybe the Princess is clearing the dirt from Honey's eyes.

01:42:02.416 --> 01:42:03.166
That's possible.

01:42:03.666 --> 01:42:05.041
If you ask the princess, that's what she will say.

01:42:05.541 --> 01:42:06.125
She's taking the dirt out.

01:42:06.625 --> 01:42:08.458
No, no...I don't believe it. No.

01:42:08.958 --> 01:42:11.208
Want to bet. - Okay.

01:42:11.708 --> 01:42:12.583
If it's heads, they're kissing.

01:42:13.083 --> 01:42:13.458
If its tails, it's dirt.

01:42:13.958 --> 01:42:14.791
Tails...equals to dirt.

01:42:15.291 --> 01:42:16.125
Okay.

01:42:16.625 --> 01:42:17.458
Where's the coin?

01:42:17.958 --> 01:42:19.125
Coin..

01:42:19.625 --> 01:42:22.416
Uday...do you have a coin? We want to toss.

01:42:22.916 --> 01:42:26.125
I have one. - Great.

01:42:26.625 --> 01:42:28.500
Give me -I don't have it.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:32.500
Forget it, I have one.

01:42:38.666 --> 01:42:39.750
What is it? - Tails.

01:42:40.250 --> 01:42:41.458
See...Tails.

01:42:41.958 --> 01:42:44.083
It's Heads, Uday. Heads.

01:42:44.583 --> 01:42:46.375
Did you have to tell them?

01:42:46.875 --> 01:42:47.708
What?

01:42:48.208 --> 01:42:49.208
They must be kissing.

01:42:49.708 --> 01:42:53.166
Honey can do anything, but the Princess will never do such a thing.

01:42:53.666 --> 01:42:55.958
Daddy, no matter how hard the fruit it..

01:42:56.458 --> 01:42:59.750
..but a knife can cut it right through.

01:43:00.250 --> 01:43:00.666
What do we care.

01:43:01.166 --> 01:43:02.375
This is between the knife and the watermelon.

01:43:02.875 --> 01:43:04.083
And the ones who own the watermelon.

01:43:04.583 --> 01:43:05.958
Come. - Come on.

01:43:06.458 --> 01:43:09.291
Now kisses and then Mrs.

01:43:09.791 --> 01:43:10.916
Thank god, it cleared.

01:43:11.416 --> 01:43:14.916
I'll just be back in 2 minutes.

01:43:17.625 --> 01:43:19.125
What's going on?

01:43:19.625 --> 01:43:22.000
What were you doing with Honey?

01:43:22.500 --> 01:43:25.333
I see...I was just clearing the dirt in his eyes.

01:43:25.833 --> 01:43:28.791
Were you clearing the dirt in his eyes, or throwing some in ours?

01:43:29.291 --> 01:43:30.875
You're doubting me? - I...

01:43:31.375 --> 01:43:33.666
You're doubting me? - Chandni.

01:43:34.166 --> 01:43:35.583
Sorry...I forgot to say thank you.

01:43:36.083 --> 01:43:38.041
Thank you? For what?

01:43:38.541 --> 01:43:39.958
Thank you for what?

01:43:40.458 --> 01:43:43.625
Thank you for clearing the dirt in my eye.

01:43:44.125 --> 01:43:45.208
And...

01:43:45.708 --> 01:43:47.583
Hello? Yes, dad.

01:43:48.083 --> 01:43:49.000
Yeah, I am coming dad

01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:50.583
Heared?

01:43:51.083 --> 01:43:51.791
Now do you see?

01:43:52.291 --> 01:43:53.125
Are you satisfied now?

01:43:53.625 --> 01:43:54.625
Its too much

01:43:55.125 --> 01:43:59.000
Idiots. How dare you doubt me?

01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:02.291
I make her understand

01:44:02.791 --> 01:44:03.750
Listen...Chandni.

01:44:04.250 --> 01:44:06.375
Listen to me... I am Uday

01:44:06.875 --> 01:44:08.958
Listen...your anger is justified.

01:44:09.458 --> 01:44:13.375
He's such a cheapster. Bloody ignorant.

01:44:13.875 --> 01:44:15.666
I'm ashamed to say he's my friend.

01:44:16.166 --> 01:44:18.125
Rascal...

01:44:18.625 --> 01:44:18.833
What happened?

01:44:19.333 --> 01:44:20.833
He isn't fit to talk to.

01:44:21.333 --> 01:44:22.208
No need to keep any relation with him.

01:44:22.708 --> 01:44:24.875
Should I come?

01:44:25.375 --> 01:44:27.208
The time has come tell him.

01:44:27.708 --> 01:44:29.750
This is the right moment, go tell him.

01:44:30.250 --> 01:44:32.333
What are you ranting?

01:44:32.833 --> 01:44:33.500
Tell him what?

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:35.416
Don't you get it?

01:44:35.916 --> 01:44:38.041
Are you small kids?

01:44:38.541 --> 01:44:40.166
Tell him...

01:44:40.666 --> 01:44:44.708
Get lost.

01:44:45.208 --> 01:44:46.291
What's wrong?

01:44:46.791 --> 01:44:47.208
Did..

01:44:47.708 --> 01:44:49.708
Kids. - Kids?

01:44:50.208 --> 01:44:53.708
Marbles? - Marbles?

01:44:57.875 --> 01:45:01.375
I don't get it. - I didn't either.

01:45:04.875 --> 01:45:06.333
Ranjana, now you'll believe me..

01:45:06.833 --> 01:45:10.166
..that I can paint your picture with my eyes closed.

01:45:10.666 --> 01:45:11.375
What is it?

01:45:11.875 --> 01:45:12.875
Give me a kiss.

01:45:13.375 --> 01:45:15.541
Someone will see us. - Who?

01:45:16.041 --> 01:45:17.916
Father's blind... and I've blinded the son.

01:45:18.416 --> 01:45:21.916
Come on.

01:45:33.583 --> 01:45:35.958
Wow...what a picture.

01:45:36.458 --> 01:45:37.041
Thank you, uncle.

01:45:37.541 --> 01:45:39.541
Come my love, I've finished painting your picture.

01:45:40.041 --> 01:45:43.583
Thank God I found out before our wedding..

01:45:44.083 --> 01:45:45.541
..otherwise my life would've been ruined.

01:45:46.041 --> 01:45:48.041
Why? What happened?

01:45:48.541 --> 01:45:51.000
I am your life? Your passion?

01:45:51.500 --> 01:45:55.333
And you painted Chandni!

01:45:55.833 --> 01:45:56.916
Who...who...made this?

01:45:57.416 --> 01:45:59.666
Hussain sir just made this. - When did he come here?

01:46:00.166 --> 01:46:00.958
It's a joke..

01:46:01.458 --> 01:46:02.708
He doesn't even understand a joke.

01:46:03.208 --> 01:46:09.208
Bro...you're too high.. you made this.

01:46:09.708 --> 01:46:11.666
I hate you, Honey! I hate you.

01:46:12.166 --> 01:46:13.416
Ranjana! Ranjana!

01:46:13.916 --> 01:46:15.500
Thank you.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.291
I am leaving

01:46:17.791 --> 01:46:18.458
Ranjana!

01:46:18.958 --> 01:46:20.416
Ranjana! Listen to me.

01:46:20.916 --> 01:46:21.333
Ranjana!

01:46:21.833 --> 01:46:24.458
Honey, forget her.

01:46:24.958 --> 01:46:25.875
What's this all about?

01:46:26.375 --> 01:46:28.666
Do you love the princess? - What are you saying, bro.

01:46:29.166 --> 01:46:31.125
I love Ranjana madly.

01:46:31.625 --> 01:46:32.250
I am crazy for her.

01:46:32.750 --> 01:46:34.750
Then how did you make the Princess' picture?

01:46:35.250 --> 01:46:35.625
Huh!

01:46:36.125 --> 01:46:39.416
Do you love the princess and want to marry Ranjana?

01:46:39.916 --> 01:46:42.125
The princess? But I met her only once.

01:46:42.625 --> 01:46:46.583
But you never met Ranjana.

01:46:47.083 --> 01:46:49.208
Are you confused?

01:46:49.708 --> 01:46:52.208
Hey...senior citizen.

01:46:52.708 --> 01:46:55.958
Honey.

01:46:56.458 --> 01:46:59.958
Hey...

01:47:04.750 --> 01:47:08.666
Mr. Painter, if you close your eyes and make a painting..

01:47:09.166 --> 01:47:09.791
..then who will it be?

01:47:10.291 --> 01:47:14.000
I will make the painting of the one I love.

01:47:14.500 --> 01:47:15.416
And you?

01:47:15.916 --> 01:47:17.916
Same as Majnu said.

01:47:18.416 --> 01:47:22.125
His love.. - No, no, I meant my girlfriend.

01:47:22.625 --> 01:47:23.458
Get it?

01:47:23.958 --> 01:47:25.791
So you don't love Ranjana.

01:47:26.291 --> 01:47:28.208
You love the one you painted today.

01:47:28.708 --> 01:47:32.541
Come, let me explain you few more things.

01:47:33.041 --> 01:47:36.291
And yes...he's made a wonderful painting.

01:47:36.791 --> 01:47:37.250
Truly amazing.

01:47:37.750 --> 01:47:41.250
You'll be amazed too.

01:47:54.166 --> 01:47:56.666
Majnu.. - Yeah..

01:47:57.166 --> 01:47:58.250
God's blessed me with everything..

01:47:58.750 --> 01:48:00.666
Stop ranting your dialogue from circa 1939...

01:48:01.166 --> 01:48:03.875
Listen to me.. - Same thing about your fame, fortune, respect.

01:48:04.375 --> 01:48:06.416
Say something else.

01:48:06.916 --> 01:48:07.541
Fine.

01:48:08.041 --> 01:48:13.000
Look...the painting is Chandni's, Honey's hands.. - Yeah.

01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:15.041
But the brain behind it is Ajju's.

01:48:15.541 --> 01:48:17.666
He wants to find a love for our bud.

01:48:18.166 --> 01:48:19.125
Tomorrow Wanted is throwing a party.

01:48:19.625 --> 01:48:22.291
And he will definitely do something in the party.

01:48:22.791 --> 01:48:29.291
So...what say?

01:48:29.791 --> 01:48:32.083
What's to say? - Meaning..

01:48:32.583 --> 01:48:33.541
It's clear.

01:48:34.041 --> 01:48:37.166
Sure? - Completely.

01:48:37.666 --> 01:48:39.416
How? - Same old way.

01:48:39.916 --> 01:48:42.083
You mean like Michael.. No, no..

01:48:42.583 --> 01:48:44.375
Like we did Teja.

01:48:44.875 --> 01:48:47.250
Fine. - Fine?

01:48:47.750 --> 01:48:48.791
Yes, fine.

01:48:49.291 --> 01:48:52.791
Yes, fine. - Yeah.

01:49:04.541 --> 01:49:05.416
"Welcome."

01:49:05.916 --> 01:49:09.416
Strangle him so hard...

01:49:16.708 --> 01:49:17.750
Quite

01:49:18.250 --> 01:49:21.750
Not me, him.

01:49:34.541 --> 01:49:36.666
Is he dead? - The rascal's dead.

01:49:37.166 --> 01:49:39.583
What? - He's dead.

01:49:40.083 --> 01:49:42.916
Why are you whispering now? - Yeah, he's dead.

01:49:43.416 --> 01:49:46.916
Give me the gunny bag. - Here.

01:49:50.833 --> 01:49:51.833
Have you seen his body?

01:49:52.333 --> 01:49:55.833
Feels like he's born in a gym.

01:50:17.666 --> 01:50:24.291
Bro... - It's the breeze.

01:50:24.791 --> 01:50:27.041
How's my cap?

01:50:27.541 --> 01:50:29.000
Go on. Go!

01:50:29.500 --> 01:50:30.416
Thank you, bro.

01:50:30.916 --> 01:50:33.750
You take care of the body... and I'll go eat my dinner.

01:50:34.250 --> 01:50:35.000
The cap's really nice.

01:50:35.500 --> 01:50:36.458
Where are you going?

01:50:36.958 --> 01:50:38.541
Go inside.

01:50:39.041 --> 01:50:42.166
Alone. - You know...I never interfere in your work.

01:50:42.666 --> 01:50:43.250
I want you to do it today.

01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:44.083
Do it. - Why?

01:50:44.583 --> 01:50:48.458
You know...I am scared of ghosts.

01:50:48.958 --> 01:50:51.750
Ghosts are just an illusion, a sound...

01:50:52.250 --> 01:50:53.125
A delusion.

01:50:53.625 --> 01:50:57.125
Who is it?

01:50:58.833 --> 01:51:00.791
Bro...

01:51:01.291 --> 01:51:04.250
Breeze...it's just the breeze.

01:51:04.750 --> 01:51:11.791
It feels nice.. cool breeze in night.

01:51:12.291 --> 01:51:12.958
What happened?

01:51:13.458 --> 01:51:16.291
How did the body get her? - We brought it here

01:51:16.791 --> 01:51:20.291
But how did it get here?

01:51:20.791 --> 01:51:21.583
Breeze?

01:51:22.083 --> 01:51:24.416
Fear. The fear inside you.

01:51:24.916 --> 01:51:25.625
Don't be scared. I am right here.

01:51:26.125 --> 01:51:26.541
Pick it up.

01:51:27.041 --> 01:51:28.125
Pick it up.

01:51:28.625 --> 01:51:30.416
Pick it up.

01:51:30.916 --> 01:51:31.291
Don't be scared.

01:51:31.791 --> 01:51:33.666
Uday Shetty's right behind you.

01:51:34.166 --> 01:51:34.791
Don't be scared.

01:51:35.291 --> 01:51:38.125
Ghosts don't care whether you're Shetty or Srivastav.

01:51:38.625 --> 01:51:42.125
They just kill whoever they want.

01:51:48.500 --> 01:51:50.541
Majnu...

01:51:51.041 --> 01:51:54.541
He's gone.

01:52:01.541 --> 01:52:03.500
I have to dig a hole here because it's Dubai.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:05.958
Back in India there are holes everywhere.

01:52:06.458 --> 01:52:09.958
I could've buried him in one of the road.

01:52:41.958 --> 01:52:43.166
I didn't kill Ajju.

01:52:43.666 --> 01:52:44.875
I'm completely reformed.

01:52:45.375 --> 01:52:47.291
That scoundrel Majnu murdered Ajju.

01:52:47.791 --> 01:52:49.208
He hasn't reformed yet.

01:52:49.708 --> 01:52:50.833
God's blessed me with everyone.

01:52:51.333 --> 01:52:55.041
Fame, Fortune, Respect... and I am still a bachelor.

01:52:55.541 --> 01:52:56.750
Uday!

01:52:57.250 --> 01:52:59.625
He knows my name.

01:53:00.125 --> 01:53:03.625
Uday!

01:53:05.666 --> 01:53:06.375
Do you have a matchstick?

01:53:06.875 --> 01:53:07.833
Matchstick?

01:53:08.333 --> 01:53:10.041
You fool...

01:53:10.541 --> 01:53:14.333
I could've died for your cheap matchstick.

01:53:14.833 --> 01:53:18.333
Can't you buy a matchstick from the same place you bought cigarettes?

01:53:25.250 --> 01:53:27.208
You're alive. - You call this life?

01:53:27.708 --> 01:53:29.166
Wandering around at untimely hours.

01:53:29.666 --> 01:53:30.416
Consider me dead.

01:53:30.916 --> 01:53:32.166
Philosophy...

01:53:32.666 --> 01:53:34.333
Philosophy...I'll put a bullet in your head.

01:53:34.833 --> 01:53:36.500
You can't kill the dead, Uday sir. I am going.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:38.291
No! Don't go. Stand here.

01:53:38.791 --> 01:53:39.583
This is just a lighter. Lighter.

01:53:40.083 --> 01:53:40.541
You don't normally see the dead.

01:53:41.041 --> 01:53:44.541
Light your cigarettes.

01:53:56.208 --> 01:53:59.708
I can't see anyone here

01:54:00.208 --> 01:54:02.166
You don't normally see the dead.

01:54:02.666 --> 01:54:03.666
Who are you looking for?

01:54:04.166 --> 01:54:05.916
Majnu. - When did he die?

01:54:06.416 --> 01:54:07.625
He isn't dead yet.

01:54:08.125 --> 01:54:11.416
He just went inside a while ago, like you.

01:54:11.916 --> 01:54:14.583
Why do they build walls at a place like this?

01:54:15.083 --> 01:54:16.541
No one in his right mind wants to go in..

01:54:17.041 --> 01:54:18.791
..and all those in there don't want to come out.

01:54:19.291 --> 01:54:21.041
Waste of money. Nonsense.

01:54:21.541 --> 01:54:25.041
Stand still

01:54:36.458 --> 01:54:37.125
Who is this?

01:54:37.625 --> 01:54:39.541
Bro.. - Did you bury him?

01:54:40.041 --> 01:54:41.208
I couldn't. - Why?

01:54:41.708 --> 01:54:43.333
The body keeps changing into the father or the son.

01:54:43.833 --> 01:54:44.458
What nonsense. - Yes.

01:54:44.958 --> 01:54:46.041
Come on, I am here now.

01:54:46.541 --> 01:54:47.458
Don't worry, Come on.

01:54:47.958 --> 01:54:51.833
So many mosquitoes here.

01:54:52.333 --> 01:54:53.583
Dig...quickly.

01:54:54.083 --> 01:54:57.583
What will they find here, Bloody mosquitoes.

01:55:06.833 --> 01:55:09.458
I guess some eunuch's been buried here.

01:55:09.958 --> 01:55:13.458
Okay.

01:55:15.916 --> 01:55:18.500
Uday...run!

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:20.916
Let's first bury him, or we'll be in trouble.

01:55:21.416 --> 01:55:23.000
Aren't we already in enough trouble?

01:55:23.500 --> 01:55:26.333
Sing...Sing... - Sing?

01:55:26.833 --> 01:55:28.291
My mother used to say, whenever you're scared sing a song.

01:55:28.791 --> 01:55:29.708
Did your mother ever try burying a body?

01:55:30.208 --> 01:55:30.875
Yes, my fathers.

01:55:31.375 --> 01:55:34.791
Now sing, come on.

01:55:35.291 --> 01:55:39.041
"Why this Kolavari-Kolavari Di."

01:55:39.541 --> 01:55:42.291
"Why this Kolavari-Kolavari Di."

01:55:42.791 --> 01:55:47.541
"Dhinka Chika-Dhinka Chika-Dhinka Chika ae-ae-ae-ae.."

01:55:48.041 --> 01:55:52.458
"Dhinka Chika-Dhinka Chika-Dhinka Chika ae-ae-ae-ae.."

01:55:52.958 --> 01:55:54.291
Why are you so happy?

01:55:54.791 --> 01:55:55.875
I know a song that starts with 'A'.

01:55:56.375 --> 01:55:57.916
Are you here to play games with the ghosts?

01:55:58.416 --> 01:55:59.208
Dig.

01:55:59.708 --> 01:56:01.083
Hey...Sing from A.

01:56:01.583 --> 01:56:02.291
Sing from A.

01:56:02.791 --> 01:56:06.083
Sing, Sing.

01:56:06.583 --> 01:56:10.166
Listen..

01:56:10.666 --> 01:56:12.250
"I do what I please."

01:56:12.750 --> 01:56:16.333
"You should do what I do."

01:56:16.833 --> 01:56:18.208
"One two Ka Four."

01:56:18.708 --> 01:56:19.708
"Four two ka One."

01:56:20.208 --> 01:56:21.583
"My name is Lakhan."

01:56:22.083 --> 01:56:25.125
"You're no hero, you're a villain."

01:56:25.625 --> 01:56:28.083
"You're a bloody dictator."

01:56:28.583 --> 01:56:31.250
"You..."

01:56:31.750 --> 01:56:32.541
Do I have to sing all the songs?

01:56:33.041 --> 01:56:34.458
Why don't you sing something?

01:56:34.958 --> 01:56:43.666
"You and me...Me and you... our love story is difficult."

01:56:44.166 --> 01:56:53.000
"Cannot be expressed in words."

01:56:53.500 --> 01:56:57.541
Come on sing.

01:56:58.041 --> 01:57:03.541
Hey...

01:57:04.041 --> 01:57:08.458
Hey...

01:57:08.958 --> 01:57:11.541
"Hey.."

01:57:12.041 --> 01:57:16.375
"What do you say? - What do we say?"

01:57:16.875 --> 01:57:19.083
"Listen. - Yes."

01:57:19.583 --> 01:57:22.000
"Let's go to Khandala."

01:57:22.500 --> 01:57:27.625
"What will we do...in Khandala."

01:57:28.125 --> 01:57:31.625
"We'll sing, we'll dance and will have your blood, what else."

01:57:37.416 --> 01:57:44.041
Run...carefully... hey...

01:57:44.541 --> 01:57:45.541
Let's close the gate.

01:57:46.041 --> 01:57:49.541
She won't come out.

01:58:09.541 --> 01:58:13.000
"Baby I am thirsty... I want to run through your veins."

01:58:13.500 --> 01:58:17.041
"Don't keep me waiting... or I'll make you suffer."

01:58:17.541 --> 01:58:20.791
"You got to grab me or I'll grab you straight."

01:58:21.291 --> 01:58:24.791
"Quench my thirst, 'cause I can no longer wait."

01:58:32.666 --> 01:58:36.041
"Let's party, party, party...party's on."

01:58:36.541 --> 01:58:39.958
"Party, party, party... let's party come on."

01:58:40.458 --> 01:58:43.875
"Let's party, party, party...party's on."

01:58:44.375 --> 01:58:47.541
"Party, party, party... let's party come on."

01:58:48.041 --> 01:58:49.625
"You're the serpent I'm the snake-charmer."

01:58:50.125 --> 01:58:51.375
"Let's party, party, party...."

01:58:51.875 --> 01:58:55.208
"When the night falls."

01:58:55.708 --> 01:58:57.166
"You're the serpent I'm the snake-charmer."

01:58:57.666 --> 01:58:58.875
"When the night falls."

01:58:59.375 --> 01:59:02.666
"You will wield your hood around."

01:59:03.166 --> 01:59:06.541
"The poison that's in you.."

01:59:07.041 --> 01:59:10.333
"..is my love."

01:59:10.833 --> 01:59:12.583
"The poison that's in you.."

01:59:13.083 --> 01:59:14.333
"..is my love."

01:59:14.833 --> 01:59:18.666
"It's going to rein terror on me."

01:59:19.166 --> 01:59:24.291
"Things are out of control."

01:59:24.791 --> 01:59:28.125
"...through my veins."

01:59:28.625 --> 01:59:29.791
"...through my veins."

01:59:30.291 --> 01:59:32.125
"You course through my veins."

01:59:32.625 --> 01:59:36.041
"...through my veins."

01:59:36.541 --> 01:59:39.833
"...through my veins."

01:59:40.333 --> 01:59:43.833
"You course through my veins."

01:59:50.125 --> 01:59:53.625
"...through my veins."

01:59:57.833 --> 02:00:01.333
"I've yearned...for your love."

02:00:07.041 --> 02:00:14.291
"I found you...after a long wait."

02:00:14.791 --> 02:00:22.416
"You dwell in me like... arrows in a quiver."

02:00:22.916 --> 02:00:26.416
"...through my veins."

02:00:26.916 --> 02:00:30.041
"...through my veins."

02:00:30.541 --> 02:00:32.041
"You course through my veins."

02:00:32.541 --> 02:00:36.041
"...through my veins."

02:00:36.541 --> 02:00:39.875
"...through my veins."

02:00:40.375 --> 02:00:43.791
"You course through my veins."

02:00:44.291 --> 02:00:48.041
"Hey listen sweety you are closest to me."

02:00:48.541 --> 02:00:51.875
"Sink in to my eyes come close to me."

02:00:52.375 --> 02:00:55.791
"Let's do this creepy huh."

02:00:56.291 --> 02:00:59.375
"You better get your head up high."

02:00:59.875 --> 02:01:01.875
"I'm here, I'm here you can try."

02:01:02.375 --> 02:01:03.791
"Now let me get you in the dark."

02:01:04.291 --> 02:01:07.625
"We met its coincidence."

02:01:08.125 --> 02:01:11.375
"...through my veins."

02:01:11.875 --> 02:01:15.333
"...through my veins."

02:01:15.833 --> 02:01:19.333
"You course through my veins."

02:01:19.833 --> 02:01:23.166
"Let's party, party, party... party's on."

02:01:23.666 --> 02:01:27.000
"Party, party, party... let's party come on."

02:01:27.500 --> 02:01:30.916
"Let's party, party, party... party's on."

02:01:31.416 --> 02:01:34.791
"Party, party, party... let's party come on."

02:01:35.291 --> 02:01:38.708
"Let's party, party, party... party's on."

02:01:39.208 --> 02:01:42.708
"Party, party, party... let's party come on."

02:01:52.708 --> 02:01:55.125
Isn't there another way? - This is the only way.

02:01:55.625 --> 02:01:57.458
But suicide is for cowards.

02:01:57.958 --> 02:02:00.583
Suicide? Who's committing suicide? - You.

02:02:01.083 --> 02:02:02.041
And taking me along.

02:02:02.541 --> 02:02:03.583
Look forward.

02:02:04.083 --> 02:02:07.083
We haven't lived completely, you're talking about dying.

02:02:07.583 --> 02:02:09.791
We haven't even found a wife yet.

02:02:10.291 --> 02:02:11.333
Then why are you driving so fast?

02:02:11.833 --> 02:02:14.208
Tension! Tension!

02:02:14.708 --> 02:02:17.416
Tension!

02:02:17.916 --> 02:02:21.208
How does one stop this thing?

02:02:21.708 --> 02:02:24.625
Doesn't this car have brakes? - Not the car.

02:02:25.125 --> 02:02:28.625
Tension. My tension!

02:02:41.416 --> 02:02:42.458
What madness is this?

02:02:42.958 --> 02:02:46.458
Trying to commit suicide?

02:02:48.166 --> 02:02:50.458
I don't want him at the cost of your life.

02:02:50.958 --> 02:02:54.833
I am prepared to marry anyone you want.

02:02:55.333 --> 02:02:56.500
I lost.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:58.375
I lost even though I won.

02:02:58.875 --> 02:03:00.541
If anything had happened to you two..

02:03:01.041 --> 02:03:02.250
..she couldn't have lived without you two.

02:03:02.750 --> 02:03:05.541
And I can't see her die.

02:03:06.041 --> 02:03:09.250
I admit I am not worthy of her.

02:03:09.750 --> 02:03:14.083
You can find some decent boy for her.

02:03:14.583 --> 02:03:17.750
Someone who can keep her happy.

02:03:18.250 --> 02:03:21.750
Ranjana...see you!

02:03:27.208 --> 02:03:29.833
Don't forget to invite me on your wedding.

02:03:30.333 --> 02:03:32.333
Hey.

02:03:32.833 --> 02:03:35.250
We can find a decent boy for her...

02:03:35.750 --> 02:03:37.833
...but where will we find a goon like you..

02:03:38.333 --> 02:03:41.833
..that can keep our sister happy.

02:03:44.875 --> 02:03:46.500
Even after 7 years we couldn't reform completely.

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:48.208
Right? - Yes.

02:03:48.708 --> 02:03:50.416
He still loads his gun..

02:03:50.916 --> 02:03:53.958
..and I still regret that I couldn't make my own Al-Qeada.

02:03:54.458 --> 02:03:59.166
And you...turned completely decent in 7 weeks.

02:03:59.666 --> 02:04:01.541
Because only Ajay can accept defeat.

02:04:02.041 --> 02:04:04.000
Not Ajju.

02:04:04.500 --> 02:04:11.041
This little girl...can sacrifice her love for us.

02:04:11.541 --> 02:04:14.833
You can sacrifice your love for her.

02:04:15.333 --> 02:04:20.375
So can't we forsake our obstinacy for your happiness.

02:04:20.875 --> 02:04:22.041
Stop staring and run along.

02:04:22.541 --> 02:04:26.041
Come on.

02:04:30.208 --> 02:04:35.583
Uday...why do we always take a right decision at the wrong time?

02:04:36.083 --> 02:04:38.500
Yeah...if we could take the right decision at the right time..

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:43.583
..then Chandni wouldn't have left us and basking in the arms of Honey.

02:04:44.083 --> 02:04:49.916
This is exactly why I put you two in the dark.

02:04:50.416 --> 02:04:52.291
But finally you two have seen the light.

02:04:52.791 --> 02:04:54.625
Now there will be darkness in Honey's life.

02:04:55.125 --> 02:04:55.750
What do you mean?

02:04:56.250 --> 02:04:59.750
Chandni played this charade of love on my request.

02:05:00.250 --> 02:05:01.666
What a rascal.

02:05:02.166 --> 02:05:05.125
I had planned an attack to stop my sister's wedding.

02:05:05.625 --> 02:05:07.250
But how will we stop Chandni's wedding?

02:05:07.750 --> 02:05:08.458
Worry not.

02:05:08.958 --> 02:05:11.000
I have an idea.

02:05:11.500 --> 02:05:12.708
Wanted's with the queen.

02:05:13.208 --> 02:05:14.333
Honey's with the princess.

02:05:14.833 --> 02:05:17.000
Father-son...mother-daughter.

02:05:17.500 --> 02:05:22.625
There should only be love between them, not love.

02:05:23.125 --> 02:05:24.750
What a rascal.

02:05:25.250 --> 02:05:27.000
What nonsense!

02:05:27.500 --> 02:05:28.750
It's not nonsense.

02:05:29.250 --> 02:05:32.583
Honey wants to marry Chandni instead of Ranjana.

02:05:33.083 --> 02:05:34.708
And you want to marry the Queen.

02:05:35.208 --> 02:05:37.333
This will make them brother-sister.

02:05:37.833 --> 02:05:39.708
It's a cocktail.

02:05:40.208 --> 02:05:40.708
Sorry uncle.

02:05:41.208 --> 02:05:45.208
At this age you should be surrounded by doctors, not damsels..

02:05:45.708 --> 02:05:45.958
Not good.

02:05:46.458 --> 02:05:48.208
Hey man...regardless of how old Wanted sir is..

02:05:48.708 --> 02:05:50.041
..even I can only last a week or two.

02:05:50.541 --> 02:05:52.500
There's no trusting this pervert, he can die any minute.

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.583
Week or two...that's too much.

02:05:56.083 --> 02:05:57.958
Look at this condition.

02:05:58.458 --> 02:06:00.500
Would it look nice if the papers next day say...

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:04.541
"Don dies of exertion in the middle of his nuptial Night."

02:06:05.041 --> 02:06:05.625
Does it look nice?

02:06:06.125 --> 02:06:07.458
The world knows..

02:06:07.958 --> 02:06:10.000
..fathers have always given sacrifices for their kids.

02:06:10.500 --> 02:06:12.208
Who would sacrifice anything for this junkie.

02:06:12.708 --> 02:06:16.000
He loves his pills more than his father. - Shut up!

02:06:16.500 --> 02:06:18.958
Dad, you're ruining your son's happiness..

02:06:19.458 --> 02:06:20.041
..for a cheap woman.

02:06:20.541 --> 02:06:20.875
How does he know?

02:06:21.375 --> 02:06:24.583
Honey! Don't forget that she's your future mother.

02:06:25.083 --> 02:06:27.958
Mother...

02:06:28.458 --> 02:06:29.250
I don't need a mother.

02:06:29.750 --> 02:06:34.125
Honey, even I never dared to go against my decision.

02:06:34.625 --> 02:06:37.041
And you...

02:06:37.541 --> 02:06:39.916
If only you weren't my son, I would've shot you.

02:06:40.416 --> 02:06:43.916
And I am shooting you because you're my father.

02:06:57.458 --> 02:06:58.708
Wanted sir.

02:06:59.208 --> 02:07:00.583
Wanted sir.

02:07:01.083 --> 02:07:01.958
What did you do?

02:07:02.458 --> 02:07:04.750
Years later his heart was blossoming with love..

02:07:05.250 --> 02:07:06.125
..but you crushed it.

02:07:06.625 --> 02:07:09.041
You opened fire on your blind father.

02:07:09.541 --> 02:07:12.041
Dad!

02:07:12.541 --> 02:07:13.208
Dad!

02:07:13.708 --> 02:07:15.958
Please wake up, dad please forgive me.

02:07:16.458 --> 02:07:17.416
What forgive me?

02:07:17.916 --> 02:07:22.708
First you shoot him and then beg for forgiveness.

02:07:23.208 --> 02:07:24.833
Your boss is dead you you're all quitting.

02:07:25.333 --> 02:07:28.833
It's a tradition to keep the guns at the boss' feet.

02:07:32.500 --> 02:07:33.791
Stop staring, pick up the guns.

02:07:34.291 --> 02:07:35.500
I'll take that one.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:36.791
What are you doing?

02:07:37.291 --> 02:07:39.541
Our tradition is to pickup the guns.

02:07:40.041 --> 02:07:40.458
Get up.

02:07:40.958 --> 02:07:44.750
Ajay. - Stop screaming... or I'll blow your brains out.

02:07:45.250 --> 02:07:47.875
Take positions.

02:07:48.375 --> 02:07:51.250
Don't move... you've a new boss now.

02:07:51.750 --> 02:07:54.583
But you will still get paid.

02:07:55.083 --> 02:08:00.583
His father troubled us more than Laden troubled America.

02:08:01.083 --> 02:08:02.041
"It's a Joke...Joke."

02:08:02.541 --> 02:08:04.666
He said it like we never heard a joke before.

02:08:05.166 --> 02:08:06.875
Swirled his head around like a spinning top.

02:08:07.375 --> 02:08:11.500
But Wanted sir...was a great man.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:15.125
And you've troubled that innocent man a lot... careful.

02:08:15.625 --> 02:08:16.125
What innocent.

02:08:16.625 --> 02:08:18.041
I am sure he wasn't innocent even when he was a kid.

02:08:18.541 --> 02:08:21.333
And what's all this... innocent, great...

02:08:21.833 --> 02:08:26.166
When you talk about someone even after he's dead...

02:08:26.666 --> 02:08:30.166
...is a great man!

02:08:33.958 --> 02:08:36.166
Joke...it was a joke.

02:08:36.666 --> 02:08:40.333
Shoot!

02:08:40.833 --> 02:08:42.333
What's wrong?

02:08:42.833 --> 02:08:43.083
It's a fake.

02:08:43.583 --> 02:08:45.333
Made in china.

02:08:45.833 --> 02:08:46.666
Mine's a fake too.

02:08:47.166 --> 02:08:50.125
Mine too.

02:08:50.625 --> 02:08:53.791
Okay.

02:08:54.291 --> 02:08:54.625
Okay.

02:08:55.125 --> 02:08:57.958
Forget the rest, how was my acting?

02:08:58.458 --> 02:09:02.250
Nice...and what about me?

02:09:02.750 --> 02:09:05.875
Great. How about we make a film? - I already made one.

02:09:06.375 --> 02:09:06.833
You already made it?

02:09:07.333 --> 02:09:10.041
Since you all arrived on this island..

02:09:10.541 --> 02:09:15.666
..me and my cameras have been keeping an eye on you constantly.

02:09:16.166 --> 02:09:19.708
Son. Start the show

02:09:20.208 --> 02:09:21.333
Hey..

02:09:21.833 --> 02:09:23.458
If the brother dies, how will the sister get married?

02:09:23.958 --> 02:09:25.375
The wedding will get postponed for 40 days.

02:09:25.875 --> 02:09:27.041
We're Shetty's.

02:09:27.541 --> 02:09:29.166
We don't celebrate for 1.25 years.

02:09:29.666 --> 02:09:33.958
And we can kill numerous Wanted bhai's in this time.

02:09:34.458 --> 02:09:38.250
To hell with that Wanted bhai.

02:09:38.750 --> 02:09:39.916
Your shoes are really nice, Wanted sir.

02:09:40.416 --> 02:09:42.125
You'll taste them soon.

02:09:42.625 --> 02:09:43.333
Son...

02:09:43.833 --> 02:09:44.250
What is this?

02:09:44.750 --> 02:09:45.750
Come on, kiss me.

02:09:46.250 --> 02:09:48.250
Someone will see us. - Who?

02:09:48.750 --> 02:09:53.750
Father's blind... and I've blinded the son.

02:09:54.250 --> 02:09:57.166
And someone introduce me to that Dr. Ghunghroo.

02:09:57.666 --> 02:10:00.291
visiting time is 11am to 3pm.

02:10:00.791 --> 02:10:01.375
No visits on Sundays.

02:10:01.875 --> 02:10:05.375
This isn't your clinic, it's my island.

02:10:09.916 --> 02:10:16.166
What a painting. - Thank you, uncle.

02:10:16.666 --> 02:10:19.208
Who made this? - Hussain sir made this.

02:10:19.708 --> 02:10:20.458
When did he come? - Forgive me.

02:10:20.958 --> 02:10:21.500
It's a joke.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:23.083
Don't you get a joke.

02:10:23.583 --> 02:10:27.708
And...where's the queen of Wallabgarh.

02:10:28.208 --> 02:10:28.916
That's Nazafgarh.

02:10:29.416 --> 02:10:34.333
I want to burry you

02:10:34.833 --> 02:10:35.958
Dear, he's a huge prey.

02:10:36.458 --> 02:10:38.750
He can even build a Taj Mahal for you.

02:10:39.250 --> 02:10:40.875
And forget about Uday and Majnu.

02:10:41.375 --> 02:10:44.791
They've crossed their expiry dates.

02:10:45.291 --> 02:10:46.333
When the police find out..

02:10:46.833 --> 02:10:50.458
..that Nazafgarh's queen and princess are hiding here..

02:10:50.958 --> 02:10:52.333
..what will happen then Babita?

02:10:52.833 --> 02:10:55.250
Poonam?

02:10:55.750 --> 02:10:59.250
Poonam? - Babita?

02:11:03.500 --> 02:11:04.416
So...

02:11:04.916 --> 02:11:06.750
...you cheap perfumes.

02:11:07.250 --> 02:11:09.875
Laurel and Hardy.

02:11:10.375 --> 02:11:13.666
In the light of all the evidence and witness..

02:11:14.166 --> 02:11:15.375
..how should I punish you two?

02:11:15.875 --> 02:11:16.916
Under section 302.

02:11:17.416 --> 02:11:23.416
I don't like those who interfere.

02:11:23.916 --> 02:11:27.708
So...no one utters a word when I'm speaking.

02:11:28.208 --> 02:11:32.208
I will decide everyone's punishment.

02:11:32.708 --> 02:11:37.333
Because...I am the law, and blind too.

02:11:37.833 --> 02:11:45.583
So... should I spare you or kill you?

02:11:46.083 --> 02:11:50.666
"Should I spare you or kill you?"

02:11:51.166 --> 02:11:56.416
"What should I do with you?

02:11:56.916 --> 02:11:58.750
"Should I spare you... - Welcome."

02:11:59.250 --> 02:12:03.750
"Should I spare you or kill you?"

02:12:04.250 --> 02:12:10.458
"What should I do with you? - Welcome."

02:12:10.958 --> 02:12:14.500
Honey. - Sir, they took Honey.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:16.541
Why didn't you tell me?

02:12:17.041 --> 02:12:20.541
You would've shot us if we did. - I still will.

02:12:26.208 --> 02:12:28.541
But where can they go?

02:12:29.041 --> 02:12:32.708
On one side is me... and on the other is the sea.

02:12:33.208 --> 02:12:36.708
And the dessert on the third side.

02:12:42.458 --> 02:12:45.250
You knew the truth about the mother-daughter, yet you didn't tell us.

02:12:45.750 --> 02:12:47.041
I thought just like you reformed, I reformed..

02:12:47.541 --> 02:12:49.208
..similarly they will reform too.

02:12:49.708 --> 02:12:51.083
Yes, we'll reform our ways.

02:12:51.583 --> 02:12:52.125
We'll reform our ways.

02:12:52.625 --> 02:12:54.708
Yes, we swear on you two.

02:12:55.208 --> 02:12:56.208
You already took everything we had.

02:12:56.708 --> 02:13:00.208
Now you want to swear on us too.

02:13:27.083 --> 02:13:30.583
Seems like Wanted has high connections.

02:15:14.375 --> 02:15:17.875
Ajju.

02:15:40.375 --> 02:15:43.875
Wanted!

02:15:46.833 --> 02:15:48.583
The first name of Death.

02:15:49.083 --> 02:15:52.416
People are scared to even befriend us.

02:15:52.916 --> 02:15:54.250
And you locked horns with me.

02:15:54.750 --> 02:15:55.541
I am with you.

02:15:56.041 --> 02:16:00.250
You brought my son here, in the desert.

02:16:00.750 --> 02:16:04.375
Now I will dig your graves right here.

02:16:04.875 --> 02:16:06.458
Kill them. Finish them all.

02:16:06.958 --> 02:16:08.458
But kill Uday and Majnu.

02:16:08.958 --> 02:16:09.166
Hey...

02:16:09.666 --> 02:16:11.458
They have ruined my life.

02:16:11.958 --> 02:16:17.583
Life and death... - Don't interfere.

02:16:18.083 --> 02:16:19.458
Look, I am not a Don, but..

02:16:19.958 --> 02:16:23.458
..even I don't like it when someone interferes.

02:16:23.958 --> 02:16:25.041
Honey, can I come there?

02:16:25.541 --> 02:16:27.875
These two are bad news.

02:16:28.375 --> 02:16:31.625
When they set foot in any neighborhood, no one gets married.

02:16:32.125 --> 02:16:33.040
No bands playing.

02:16:33.540 --> 02:16:34.583
No trumpets blaring.

02:16:35.083 --> 02:16:36.375
The sales of double-bed dips down.

02:16:36.875 --> 02:16:38.083
Your father was supposed to get married.

02:16:38.583 --> 02:16:39.290
Did it happen?

02:16:39.790 --> 02:16:40.375
No

02:16:40.875 --> 02:16:42.500
Did you get married? - No.

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:44.125
Did I? - No.

02:16:44.625 --> 02:16:44.790
No, I didn't.

02:16:45.290 --> 02:16:46.790
We didn't get married either. - No.

02:16:47.290 --> 02:16:48.665
These two are bad luck.

02:16:49.165 --> 02:16:52.250
And Wanted sir, we became enemies because of them.

02:16:52.750 --> 02:16:54.833
I'll break this relation today.

02:16:55.333 --> 02:16:57.958
This will end the enmity between us, right?

02:16:58.458 --> 02:16:59.750
I feel so relieved.

02:17:00.250 --> 02:17:01.833
See you. - Okay, uncle.

02:17:02.333 --> 02:17:02.708
Let's go.

02:17:03.208 --> 02:17:06.708
Come, dad. - Come on, let's go.

02:17:15.708 --> 02:17:19.000
First you duped me when you got her.

02:17:19.500 --> 02:17:22.040
Now you're trying to dupe me before you die.

02:17:22.540 --> 02:17:25.665
What do you think I am?

02:17:26.165 --> 02:17:29.625
Now I'm going to play a game with you.

02:17:30.125 --> 02:17:30.500
Game?

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:32.083
The game of death.

02:17:32.583 --> 02:17:35.333
Sir.

02:17:35.833 --> 02:17:39.333
Fantastic, dad, my favorite game.

02:17:46.165 --> 02:17:48.833
You like to run, don't you?

02:17:49.333 --> 02:17:52.833
Now run.

02:18:03.875 --> 02:18:05.208
Run!

02:18:05.708 --> 02:18:09.208
Run!

02:19:15.458 --> 02:19:15.833
What happened?

02:19:16.333 --> 02:19:19.833
Why are the choppers after them now? - I don't know.

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:24.665
Let's go.

02:19:25.165 --> 02:19:28.208
Let's go.

02:19:28.708 --> 02:19:30.708
Let's go...let's go.

02:19:31.208 --> 02:19:32.458
Someone help me!

02:19:32.958 --> 02:19:34.708
Don't worry

02:19:35.208 --> 02:19:38.708
Throw it

02:19:47.458 --> 02:19:49.125
Let's go...let's go.

02:19:49.625 --> 02:19:55.208
Where's the steering? - Left...on the left.

02:19:55.708 --> 02:19:57.416
I am under the car.

02:19:57.916 --> 02:19:58.583
Honey's down there.

02:19:59.083 --> 02:20:00.125
Start quickly.

02:20:00.625 --> 02:20:05.333
Crush him.

02:20:05.833 --> 02:20:06.750
Amazing toys.

02:20:07.250 --> 02:20:08.333
We'll buy these for our kids.

02:20:08.833 --> 02:20:11.166
Let's get married first. - Come on, get down.

02:20:11.666 --> 02:20:13.458
Someone help me?

02:20:13.958 --> 02:20:17.458
Someone help this poor helpless blind man.

02:20:21.875 --> 02:20:25.083
Where's my chopper?

02:20:25.583 --> 02:20:28.708
Where did I drop my diamond ring?

02:20:29.208 --> 02:20:30.416
Diamond ring? - Yeah.

02:20:30.916 --> 02:20:31.666
I'll look for it.

02:20:32.166 --> 02:20:33.916
If I could find then mine otherwise yours

02:20:34.416 --> 02:20:34.416
What?

02:20:34.916 --> 02:20:35.875
Where's my chopper?

02:20:36.375 --> 02:20:37.625
Chopper. - Where's my chopper?

02:20:38.125 --> 02:20:39.166
But you lost your diamond ring, didn't you?

02:20:39.666 --> 02:20:40.875
It was a joke...joke!

02:20:41.375 --> 02:20:42.750
Joke? - Where's my chopper?

02:20:43.250 --> 02:20:44.500
My right. - Come on.

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:45.458
Come on. - Together.

02:20:45.958 --> 02:20:49.458
Take me there.

02:21:04.541 --> 02:21:08.041
Dad! Dad, run!

02:21:20.250 --> 02:21:21.250
Camel

02:21:21.750 --> 02:21:25.333
Faster! Faster!

02:21:25.833 --> 02:21:26.500
What faster?

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:27.958
I was telling the camels. - Yeah.

02:21:28.458 --> 02:21:28.875
Faster.

02:21:29.375 --> 02:21:34.291
Crush him. Mangle him. Spill his guts!

02:21:34.791 --> 02:21:36.000
Somebody help my dad!

02:21:36.500 --> 02:21:39.708
Help my dad!

02:21:40.208 --> 02:21:43.708
Help my dad!

02:22:02.708 --> 02:22:04.791
Ajju.

02:22:05.291 --> 02:22:08.250
Ajay

02:22:08.750 --> 02:22:11.583
Ranjana might get widowed before she gets married.

02:22:12.083 --> 02:22:13.333
Don't say that.

02:22:13.833 --> 02:22:17.333
We'll have to look for another boy.

02:22:22.625 --> 02:22:26.125
Where did these cames come from?

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:32.500
Ajay..!

02:22:39.583 --> 02:22:41.208
Rascals...get my son out.

02:22:41.708 --> 02:22:42.625
Yes, boss.

02:22:43.125 --> 02:22:43.458
Honey..

02:22:43.958 --> 02:22:47.125
His aim's absolutely perfect, exactly at the legs.

02:22:47.625 --> 02:22:50.208
His aim's getting better than us.

02:22:50.708 --> 02:22:54.291
Honey, my son. Are you okay?

02:22:54.791 --> 02:22:58.458
Dad...your eyes?

02:22:58.958 --> 02:23:03.583
"Nothing matters in this world...except for these eyes."

02:23:04.083 --> 02:23:08.833
Today I realized Ghungroo... that you're push is really lucky.

02:23:09.333 --> 02:23:11.041
But who switched on his lights.

02:23:11.541 --> 02:23:13.041
Yes...it's hard to find water in this desert..

02:23:13.541 --> 02:23:14.291
..and he got his eyes back.

02:23:14.791 --> 02:23:17.458
Goddess can work her miracles even in the desert.

02:23:18.375 --> 02:23:25.375
Now, I can see women and wink at them.

02:23:25.875 --> 02:23:29.250
And shoot the men.

02:23:29.750 --> 02:23:33.333
Father returned my eye-sight..

02:23:33.833 --> 02:23:35.708
..and the son saved my life.

02:23:36.208 --> 02:23:37.416
You two can go.

02:23:37.916 --> 02:23:39.208
Ajju!

02:23:39.708 --> 02:23:43.875
Why did you save him?

02:23:44.375 --> 02:23:45.750
We were going to save him.

02:23:46.250 --> 02:23:47.208
Yeah, he got their first...

02:23:47.708 --> 02:23:48.708
..but we were coming to save you.

02:23:49.208 --> 02:23:50.166
We'll go with them. - Yes.

02:23:50.666 --> 02:23:54.166
We'll go too. - Come on.

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.500
Wanted, don't forget that..

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.416
..you can see again because of us. - Right.

02:24:02.916 --> 02:24:08.125
If we hadn't kidnapped your son, you wouldn't have come here.

02:24:08.625 --> 02:24:10.958
And if you hadn't come here, you wouldn't have regained your eyesight. - Right?

02:24:11.458 --> 02:24:12.083
Right?

02:24:12.583 --> 02:24:15.791
Uncle, I admit I played games with you.

02:24:16.291 --> 02:24:17.250
Cheated you.

02:24:17.750 --> 02:24:19.250
But I did it for my love.

02:24:19.750 --> 02:24:21.541
And these two did it for the love of their sister.

02:24:22.041 --> 02:24:24.375
You have all done what you had to.

02:24:24.875 --> 02:24:25.875
Now it's my turn.

02:24:26.375 --> 02:24:32.125
On the 13th Ranjana and my son will get married.

02:24:32.625 --> 02:24:33.458
Ranjana's done for.

02:24:33.958 --> 02:24:36.125
But dad, she loves Ajay.

02:24:36.625 --> 02:24:44.166
Yes...so...I was speaking about my other son Ajay.

02:24:44.666 --> 02:24:48.458
It was not a joke... not a Joke!

02:24:48.958 --> 02:24:52.458
Congratulations! Congratulations! Congratulations!

02:25:01.416 --> 02:25:04.833
All these camels running together, means there's a storm coming.

02:25:05.333 --> 02:25:06.458
He just got his eyesight 10 minutes ago..

02:25:06.958 --> 02:25:10.458
..and he's already seeing the storm.

02:25:14.541 --> 02:25:16.875
Are we waiting here to welcome the storm?

02:25:17.375 --> 02:25:18.708
Hold hands everyone.

02:25:19.208 --> 02:25:22.708
Run!

02:25:29.375 --> 02:25:32.125
God's blessed me with everything... Fame, fortune, respect..

02:25:32.625 --> 02:25:33.666
..only thing missing was a storm.

02:25:34.166 --> 02:25:34.958
And the devil fulfilled that too.

02:25:35.458 --> 02:25:38.916
I think someone's cursed us with all the problems in the world.

02:25:39.416 --> 02:25:40.416
Run, Majnu.

02:25:40.916 --> 02:25:41.625
I've been running since I was a kid.

02:25:42.125 --> 02:25:42.416
First...I ran from school.

02:25:42.916 --> 02:25:43.708
Then I ran after stealing bread.

02:25:44.208 --> 02:25:45.250
After I became a gangster, I ran from the police.

02:25:45.750 --> 02:25:46.291
I ran when I had to sit.

02:25:46.791 --> 02:25:47.333
I ran when I had to walk.

02:25:47.833 --> 02:25:49.875
And when I had to run, I am running like a dog.

02:25:50.375 --> 02:25:53.875
I spent my entire life running.

02:26:09.083 --> 02:26:10.416
"Get over here tonight."

02:26:10.916 --> 02:26:12.291
"I'll call you what you like."

02:26:12.791 --> 02:26:15.958
"We'll make it such a night, to remember all our life."

02:26:16.458 --> 02:26:17.750
"You let me call you baby."

02:26:18.250 --> 02:26:19.666
"I'll really blow you mind."

02:26:20.166 --> 02:26:23.333
"O boy make your mind up.."

02:26:23.833 --> 02:26:27.333
"..we're running out of time."

02:26:31.416 --> 02:26:34.916
"Welcome back."

02:26:37.916 --> 02:26:39.625
"Welcome.. Welcome.. Welcome.."

02:26:40.125 --> 02:26:42.291
"Welcome."

02:26:42.791 --> 02:26:43.083
"Welcome back."

02:26:43.583 --> 02:26:46.083
"Welcome."

02:26:46.583 --> 02:26:46.666
"Let me love you."

02:26:47.166 --> 02:26:50.666
"Love you all I can."

02:26:51.166 --> 02:26:54.500
"My heart's crazy about you."

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:58.666
"I want to give you this heart."

02:26:59.166 --> 02:27:01.416
"Welcome."

02:27:01.916 --> 02:27:03.291
"Welcome Back."

02:27:03.791 --> 02:27:04.458
"Welcome."

02:27:04.958 --> 02:27:07.666
"Welcome Back."

02:27:08.166 --> 02:27:09.541
"O Girl...you're intoxicating... like a bottle of liquor."

02:27:10.041 --> 02:27:13.250
"And I feel intoxicated."

02:27:13.750 --> 02:27:15.041
"Crazy girl...she's so drunk.."

02:27:15.541 --> 02:27:16.916
"..that she's holding me.."

02:27:17.416 --> 02:27:19.375
"...instead of her friend."

02:27:19.875 --> 02:27:23.041
"She runs around the club, and trips on me."

02:27:23.541 --> 02:27:27.250
"Tell me why are you so drunk?"

02:27:27.750 --> 02:27:30.333
"Welcome."

02:27:30.833 --> 02:27:31.291
"Welcome Back."

02:27:31.791 --> 02:27:35.541
"Welcome."

02:27:36.041 --> 02:27:38.708
"Welcome."

02:27:39.208 --> 02:27:41.833
"Welcome Back."

02:27:42.333 --> 02:27:44.833
"Dance on the floor..."

02:27:45.333 --> 02:27:46.708
"...and create an uproar."

02:27:47.208 --> 02:27:50.333
"Dance for me baby girl."

02:27:50.833 --> 02:27:52.208
"You sway...on the floor."

02:27:52.708 --> 02:27:54.041
"Like fire...reaching high."

02:27:54.541 --> 02:27:57.166
"Dance for me baby girl."
