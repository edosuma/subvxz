00:01.635 --> 00:02.936
- Good morning, all.

00:02.970 --> 00:05.105
Sorry, no time for
morning discourse.

00:05.138 --> 00:07.508
I'm running late for work.

00:07.541 --> 00:08.876
- Did he say late for work?

00:08.909 --> 00:09.877
- Wait for it.

00:09.910 --> 00:14.548
Five, four, three,
two, one.

00:26.593 --> 00:29.296
- I keep forgetting.

00:29.329 --> 00:30.397
I'm retired now.

00:33.667 --> 00:36.737
- This is the fourth time
in two weeks he's done this.

00:36.770 --> 00:38.238
- What do you think
that's about?

00:38.272 --> 00:39.840
- Retirement grief.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.975
My sixth husband
struggled with it.

00:42.009 --> 00:44.344
He'd get up just like
Reginald and show up to work

00:44.378 --> 00:46.346
months after he was retired.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.081
- Aw, it sounds
kind of sweet.

00:48.115 --> 00:49.683
- He was a gynecologist.

00:49.716 --> 00:51.919
Nothing sweet about
a strange man popping up

00:51.952 --> 00:53.954
in the middle of your
pap smear.

00:53.987 --> 00:55.055
- Ooh!

00:55.088 --> 00:56.957
- Turns out they frown
upon that.

00:56.990 --> 00:59.092
Lesson learned.

00:59.126 --> 01:01.061
- Okay, on that note,

01:01.094 --> 01:02.229
Miss Anastasia, come on,

01:02.262 --> 01:04.064
let's go check
your blood sugar.

01:04.097 --> 01:05.632
[laughing]

01:08.969 --> 01:10.671
- Why you trying to act
all like that?

01:10.704 --> 01:13.440
- Mr. Brown, you said
that car was in perfect shape.

01:13.473 --> 01:15.809
Alright, now yesterday, it
started making a noise like

01:15.843 --> 01:18.645
it had high cholesterol, a touch
of gout,

01:18.679 --> 01:22.583
or like it's been smoking
since it was 12.

01:22.616 --> 01:25.118
- You talking about
the car or Vinny?

01:25.152 --> 01:29.389
- I didn't start smoking
cigarettes until I was 20.

01:29.423 --> 01:33.694
I was smoking pipes
when I was 12.

01:33.727 --> 01:36.496
- Well, it was working
just fine last week,

01:36.530 --> 01:38.131
now it's making weird
sounds.

01:38.165 --> 01:41.835
- Oh, hey, do it make a sound
like cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck?

01:41.869 --> 01:44.171
Cluck, cluck, cluck,
cluck?

01:44.204 --> 01:45.973
'Cause if it's making them
kind of sounds, that means

01:46.006 --> 01:47.941
you got the windshield
wipers and the headlights on

01:47.975 --> 01:49.476
at the same time.

01:49.510 --> 01:51.011
You--you can't do that.
Don't do that.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.479
- You know, I made that
sound one time

01:52.513 --> 01:54.147
when I was having sex.

01:54.181 --> 01:56.283
Turns out I was having
a heart attack.

01:56.316 --> 01:59.586
I was going
k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k.

01:59.620 --> 02:02.055
Call 911!
[laughs]

02:02.089 --> 02:04.858
- If you ever hear
the car going gu-gu-gu-gu.

02:04.892 --> 02:06.827
Gu-gu-gu-gu-gu,
like that.

02:06.860 --> 02:08.962
That means you need to put
some low octane gas in it,

02:09.062 --> 02:11.231
then on top of it, put
high octane,

02:11.265 --> 02:12.833
then a sprinkle of hot sauce.

02:12.866 --> 02:14.735
Just like lightly,
just hot sauce.

02:14.768 --> 02:16.103
- That don't sound right.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.538
- Oh, and if you ever hear
it going...

02:17.571 --> 02:21.508
[beatboxing]

02:21.542 --> 02:22.876
That mean I left my
Dougie Fresh tape

02:22.910 --> 02:25.279
in the cassette deck.
- [laughs]

02:25.312 --> 02:27.414
- Man, I don't know, it's
just making funny sounds.

02:27.447 --> 02:28.782
- Trust me, I had that
car for 20 years.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.584
It's in tiptop shape.

02:30.617 --> 02:32.186
Now, the only sound you
need to be worrying about

02:32.219 --> 02:35.722
is whoop-whoop-whoop,
whoop-whoop-whoop.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.324
- Why? What's that?

02:37.357 --> 02:38.926
- That means you're getting
stopped by the police.

02:38.959 --> 02:40.327
You don't need that
smoke again.

02:40.360 --> 02:41.895
- No, you don't.

02:41.929 --> 02:43.697
- I gotta run down
to the church. I'll see y'all!

02:45.232 --> 02:47.568
- [doorbell rings]

02:47.601 --> 02:49.101
- Why are you looking at
me like that?

02:49.102 --> 02:50.737
Man, you know we needed
a new car.

02:50.771 --> 02:52.439
Philip about to start
driving soon.

02:52.472 --> 02:55.275
- Two things my daddy told
me when I was a little boy.

02:55.309 --> 02:57.010
Number one:
never buy a car

02:57.110 --> 03:00.914
from a man
dressed like a clown. Okay?

03:00.948 --> 03:03.617
And number two:
stop smoking my cigarettes!

03:05.344 --> 03:09.114

- ♪ No matter what you do
I love you ♪

03:09.147 --> 03:10.949

♪ No matter where you go

03:10.983 --> 03:13.118

♪ I'm behind you for sure

03:13.151 --> 03:16.088

♪ Always remember,
blood ain't never water ♪

03:16.121 --> 03:18.557

♪ We'll make it
if we stay together ♪♪

03:20.875 --> 03:24.913

- ♪

03:24.946 --> 03:27.816

- Guys, Reginald needs
our help.

03:27.849 --> 03:30.218

There are seven stages
to retirement grief:

03:30.251 --> 03:32.821

shock, frustration,
anxiety, anger,

03:32.854 --> 03:35.323

being out of sync,
feeling lost, irrelevant.

03:35.356 --> 03:39.060

He's gone through three
since breakfast.

03:39.094 --> 03:41.229

- [smacking]

03:41.262 --> 03:43.231

- Well, I'm going through
my anger stage right now

03:43.264 --> 03:47.001

if Efe don't stop
smacking over there.

03:47.035 --> 03:49.971

- I'm sorry, this oxtail is
divine.

03:50.004 --> 03:52.807

It's taking my taste buds
to heaven.

03:52.841 --> 03:57.011

- Well, it's taking
my ear buds to hell.

03:57.045 --> 03:59.714

- Fine, I'll finish it
in my room.

03:59.748 --> 04:02.150

- Thank you. And close the door
so we can't hear you.

04:02.183 --> 04:04.119

- Oh, Reginald.

04:04.152 --> 04:06.421

Just the man we were
talking about.

04:06.454 --> 04:07.889

Come, come.

04:08.990 --> 04:10.158
Sit.

04:11.159 --> 04:12.894
- What is this about?

04:12.927 --> 04:14.863
- Well, apparently, you don't
know how to sit your ass down

04:14.896 --> 04:16.998
and enjoy retirement.

04:17.031 --> 04:18.366
- I beg your pardon?

04:18.399 --> 04:19.501
- Oh man.

04:19.534 --> 04:23.671
- Darling, we've noticed
some shifts in your behavior,

04:23.705 --> 04:26.775
particularly with you
forgetting that you're retired

04:26.808 --> 04:28.643
and getting dressed
to go to work.

04:28.676 --> 04:30.912
- Well, that's just residual
muscle memory.

04:30.945 --> 04:32.347
It could happen
to anybody.

04:32.380 --> 04:34.249
- You know what? Nobody
ever had to remind me

04:34.282 --> 04:35.750
not to go to work.

04:35.784 --> 04:38.753
It was usually
the other way around.

04:38.787 --> 04:42.223
- I've seen this behavior
in the newly retired.

04:42.257 --> 04:44.793
Will you let us help you?

04:44.826 --> 04:49.130
- Sure, since it's not
like I have a job to go to.

04:49.164 --> 04:53.968
- Okay, so...what are
your favorite hobbies?

04:54.002 --> 04:54.969
- I don't know.

04:55.003 --> 04:56.371
I never thought about it.

04:56.404 --> 04:59.207
- Well, what do you like
to do for fun?

04:59.240 --> 05:02.677
- Mm...I like reading.

05:02.710 --> 05:04.979
- Okay, I think that's
something that we can--

05:05.013 --> 05:06.381
we can do.
- Law journals

05:06.414 --> 05:10.118
and court transcripts,
opinion pieces.

05:10.151 --> 05:11.753
- Brother, if you was
any more boring,

05:11.786 --> 05:14.155
your ass would be dead.

05:14.189 --> 05:15.290
- I have an idea.

05:16.424 --> 05:19.294
Just like in real estate,
location, location, location.

05:19.327 --> 05:21.763
When cooking, it's all
about ingredients,

05:21.796 --> 05:23.998
ingredients, ingredients.

05:24.032 --> 05:26.167
So, now that everything
is measured,

05:26.201 --> 05:28.269
you can put the rice in.
- Right.

05:28.303 --> 05:30.305
- Now you have to measure
it, that's why we measure,

05:30.338 --> 05:32.941
because if you put too
much in,

05:32.974 --> 05:35.143
it could get sticky.
- Ew.

05:35.176 --> 05:36.678
- Okay, brace yourself,
you ready?

05:36.711 --> 05:38.346
- Go ahead, Mr. Reginald.
- Come on, you can do it.

05:38.379 --> 05:39.881
You can do it.
- Alrighty, I'm pouring

05:39.914 --> 05:41.349
the rice in.
- Okay. Yeah!

05:41.382 --> 05:44.185
You did it!
Oh my God, you did it!

05:44.219 --> 05:46.221
You did it!
- [applause]

05:46.254 --> 05:48.690
- Yeah, Mr. Reginald!
- I'm so proud of you.

05:48.723 --> 05:49.958
- [laughing]

05:49.991 --> 05:51.826
I'm sorry, dear, this
is not me.

05:51.860 --> 05:53.661
I'm bored to tears.

05:55.663 --> 05:57.232
- This is bonsai.

05:57.265 --> 06:00.235
A thousand-year-old
art form that requires

06:00.268 --> 06:03.104
patience and time
and--

06:03.138 --> 06:06.207
- [sneezes]
Allergy medicine.

06:06.241 --> 06:09.110
Triggers--triggers
my hay fever.

06:09.144 --> 06:11.379
- Bye-bye bonsai.
- [sneezes]

06:11.413 --> 06:13.314
- Okay, you--you can
keep this one.

06:13.348 --> 06:16.084
- Thank you.
[sneezing]

06:16.117 --> 06:17.719
- Go--God bless you!

06:17.752 --> 06:19.921
- [sneezing]

06:19.954 --> 06:21.256
- Now what are we gonna do?

06:21.289 --> 06:22.924
- It should not be
that difficult to teach

06:22.957 --> 06:24.793
someone how to enjoy
retirement.

06:24.826 --> 06:26.161
- Alright, ladies,

06:26.194 --> 06:27.929
I'll take it from here.

06:27.962 --> 06:29.631
Sitting around doing
nothing,

06:29.664 --> 06:31.299
that's ol' Vinny's speciality,
baby.

06:33.234 --> 06:36.104
Let's move it, Reggie!
[laughs]

06:36.137 --> 06:38.173
- What is taking him
so long?

06:38.206 --> 06:39.941
- REGINALD:
My name is Reginald.

06:39.974 --> 06:41.076
- Come on, man!
Get out here!

06:41.109 --> 06:43.344
People need to see.
[laughs]

06:43.378 --> 06:49.350
- What the--oh my God.
- [laughs]

06:49.384 --> 06:52.687
- What is the meaning
of this?

06:52.720 --> 06:55.190
- This is a work of art.

06:55.223 --> 06:56.825
We got one final piece.

06:56.858 --> 06:59.160
Take it over here.
Just move it, move it, move it.

06:59.194 --> 07:00.862
Looking good.

07:03.131 --> 07:04.665
Take a seat.
- You sure?

07:04.666 --> 07:06.835
- No, man, go ahead,
sit down, man.

07:06.868 --> 07:08.937
[laughs]

07:08.970 --> 07:10.939
There you go,
lean back now.

07:10.972 --> 07:13.141
Lean all the way.
All the way back.

07:13.174 --> 07:14.409
Don't it feel good?

07:14.442 --> 07:15.677
- Okay.
- Cross your legs.

07:15.710 --> 07:16.878
Cross your legs.
- Now what?

07:16.911 --> 07:22.317
- Cross your legs. [laughing]

07:22.350 --> 07:26.254
There you go, uh-huh.
- Okay.

07:26.287 --> 07:28.189
I could get used
to this.

07:28.223 --> 07:30.925
Now what?
- You're doing it, man.

07:30.959 --> 07:32.293
Nothing.

07:32.327 --> 07:33.795
See that chair right there,
man?

07:33.828 --> 07:36.664
That chair is magic.
Get comfortable, man.

07:36.698 --> 07:38.266
All you gotta do is
gotta make sure you don't

07:38.299 --> 07:39.901
put your hand down
on the side

07:39.934 --> 07:41.636
where they have them
little wet sticky tissues there.

07:43.905 --> 07:45.740
- Good Lord, I don't
got time.

07:45.774 --> 07:48.343
What the what?

07:48.376 --> 07:50.211
Cora said if you pour
water on the gremlins

07:50.245 --> 07:52.847
they'll start multiplying.

07:52.881 --> 07:56.184
What are y'all trying to do?
Like be an old rap group?

07:56.217 --> 07:58.219
- This is preposterous.

08:00.889 --> 08:03.057
- Wait a minute, man, you didn't
even put on the cologne.

08:03.091 --> 08:04.726
You gotta put a lot of
cologne on.

08:04.759 --> 08:07.362
- What are you trying to turn
him into a little mini pimp?

08:07.395 --> 08:09.097
What was they--what was--
- Mr. Brown!

08:09.130 --> 08:10.365
- Huh?
- I need to talk to you

08:10.398 --> 08:12.066
right now.
- Honey, honey, honey.

08:12.100 --> 08:14.402
Honey, remember to stay
calm, okay? Calm.

08:14.436 --> 08:17.172
- Okay, what we staying
calm for? What happened?

08:17.205 --> 08:18.673
- That piece of junk you
sold me last week.

08:18.706 --> 08:20.341
- Mm-hmm.
- Is making noises again.

08:20.375 --> 08:23.244
- Oh, was it going
ra-ra-ra or was it the ahh--

08:23.278 --> 08:24.512
- It don't matter.
It don't matter, okay?

08:24.612 --> 08:27.348
As soon as we got in the car, it
started filling up with smoke.

08:27.382 --> 08:29.184
- Oh, well, y'all not to
be smoking in there.

08:29.217 --> 08:31.753
That--that mess up your lungs.
- It wasn't us!

08:31.786 --> 08:35.223
- [chuckles]
Stay calm, Cujo. Heal.

08:35.256 --> 08:38.326
- It wasn't us.
It was the car, okay?

08:38.359 --> 08:40.195
You sold me a car that
got a bad exhaust.

08:40.228 --> 08:41.663
- No, I didn't.

08:41.696 --> 08:43.630
That car was fine when
I sold it to you.

08:43.631 --> 08:46.935
And I'm assaulted by
your accusations.

08:46.968 --> 08:49.204
- These ain't no accusations.
These are facts, alright?

08:49.237 --> 08:50.705
You sold me a lemon,
now it's time for you

08:50.738 --> 08:52.140
to give me the money
to pay for it.

08:52.173 --> 08:53.308
- Ha-uh-uh, I ain't sell
you no lemon,

08:53.341 --> 08:54.776
and I can't giving you
jack.

08:54.809 --> 08:56.077
- Well, then give me
my money back.

08:56.111 --> 08:58.646
- Over--over Efe's
dead body.

08:58.680 --> 09:00.215
We made a deal
mano-to-mano.

09:00.248 --> 09:02.117
And plus, I said
no takebacks,

09:02.150 --> 09:03.685
and my fingers was crossed.

you out of the system.

09:23.171 --> 09:25.306
- Defecation of character.
- Uh.

09:25.340 --> 09:28.643

absolutely deplorable.

09:28.676 --> 09:30.678

- Someone needs to

09:30.712 --> 09:33.614
take you to court.
- Thank you.

09:33.615 --> 09:36.151
- Mr. Brown, I don't
think "defecation"

09:36.184 --> 09:38.620
is the word you're trying
to use.

09:38.653 --> 09:42.023
- His false accusation is
soiling my good name.

09:42.056 --> 09:46.661
- Uh, I guess defecation is the
word you were trying to use.

09:46.694 --> 09:48.897
- Oh, okay, well, fine.
Fine, I'll see you in court.

09:48.930 --> 09:50.665

Baby, listen.

10:06.206 --> 10:08.675
We have to find another way
to resolve this besides

10:08.708 --> 10:11.978

- Yes.

10:12.011 --> 10:14.147
Let them fight.
- Ha!

10:14.180 --> 10:17.183
- In my country, we beat
each other silly.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.818
- Efe, no, no!

10:18.852 --> 10:20.186
- I think I have
a solution.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.122
- Please, 'cause
I'm over it.

10:25.091 --> 10:27.994
- You two seem pretty
set on your stance.

10:28.027 --> 10:29.896
- You're damn right,
'cause he sold me a lemon.

10:29.929 --> 10:33.700
- No, he defecated
my name.

10:33.733 --> 10:35.068
- Never mind.

10:35.101 --> 10:36.903
You say that you want
to go to court.

10:36.936 --> 10:38.872
But what I really think
you mean is that

10:38.905 --> 10:42.809
you want an impartial judge
to hear your cases

10:42.842 --> 10:44.944
and make a decision, right?

10:44.978 --> 10:46.880
- Yeah, that's pretty
much it.

10:46.913 --> 10:48.348
- Yeah.

10:48.381 --> 10:51.451
- Well, it just so happens
that we have a judge here

10:51.484 --> 10:55.155
that's impartial and
who has a brilliant legal mind.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.190

about Vinny 2.0?

10:57.223 --> 10:58.725
- Yes, Reginald.

10:58.758 --> 11:00.860
He's having a hard time
dealing,

11:00.894 --> 11:04.764
and I think with his
retirement being so sudden,

11:04.798 --> 11:06.199
he needs a case like this.

11:06.232 --> 11:08.301
Another case to reinvigorate
him.

a real judge...

11:20.947 --> 11:24.317

you court costs?

would be great for our case.

that stupid Kangol.

your day in court.

lock in the judge.

you snatched.

14:02.809 --> 14:05.644

the car was in disrepair

14:12.018 --> 14:13.353

to my God.

18:13.193 --> 18:15.161
And the way they were
at each other's throats,

18:15.195 --> 18:17.297
you probably saved
Pleasant Days.

18:17.330 --> 18:20.667
- I presided over a trial
at an assisted living facility

18:20.700 --> 18:22.902
in a choir robe.
- Oh, by the way,

18:22.936 --> 18:27.207
we need to get that robe back to
Brown before he needs it.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.175
- I appreciate your efforts
in all this,

18:29.209 --> 18:32.679
but I have a fear that
it may have had an averse effect

18:32.712 --> 18:34.347
than what you had intended.

18:34.380 --> 18:37.650
All this has done is...

18:37.684 --> 18:40.253
reminded me of what
I'd missed.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.888
- What do you mean?

18:41.921 --> 18:44.324
- I spent 50 years working
in the law, and I was

18:44.357 --> 18:48.795
damn good at what I did
until I realized that I...

18:48.828 --> 18:52.732
wasn't as sharp as I used to be.

18:52.766 --> 18:55.135
Short-term memory loss here.

18:55.168 --> 18:58.004
Can't find the right word
there.

18:58.037 --> 19:01.841
- Mr. Walking Thesaurus
having difficulty finding words?

19:01.875 --> 19:03.743
- I realized that I wasn't
gonna be able to operate

19:03.777 --> 19:06.913
in the position of judge
in good conscience,

19:06.946 --> 19:09.983
so I stepped down and started

19:10.016 --> 19:13.920
my long descent into retirement.

19:13.953 --> 19:17.991
- Losing a step is
the aging process.

19:18.024 --> 19:22.829
But what we all saw tonight
was a Judge Junie

19:22.862 --> 19:26.933
who knew how to control
an unruly courtroom.

19:26.966 --> 19:29.836
Who masterfully pieced
together a mystery

19:29.869 --> 19:32.906
like a Black Perry Mason.

19:32.939 --> 19:35.175
You still have a lot
to offer.

19:35.208 --> 19:37.343
You have skills and
talents that you can

19:37.377 --> 19:39.078
use in many capacities.

19:39.112 --> 19:41.214
You just have to figure it out.

19:41.247 --> 19:42.248
- You know, you're right.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.650
- I know I'm right.

19:43.683 --> 19:44.818
That's my talent.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.886
- BOTH: [laughs]

19:46.920 --> 19:48.688
- And I'm gonna take
your advice.

19:48.721 --> 19:52.959
Maybe even mentor
at-risk youth.

19:52.992 --> 19:54.828
Find a way to keep them
out of the system.

19:54.861 --> 19:57.263
- That is a brilliant
idea.

19:57.297 --> 20:02.202
- Now, I need to go
sentence at-risk Brown

20:02.235 --> 20:03.670
and his delinquency.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.205
- [laughing]

20:05.238 --> 20:08.908
By the way, Your Honor,
that robe is on fleek.

20:08.942 --> 20:10.376
- Yeah. [sniffs]
Smell the smoke.

20:13.687 --> 20:15.422
- How you gonna tell me
you won, you lose.

20:15.456 --> 20:18.359
- Mr. Brown?
- Hm?

20:18.392 --> 20:20.227
- I still can't believe you
tried to play me like that.

20:20.261 --> 20:23.297
Man, we supposed to be
business partners.

20:23.330 --> 20:27.034
- Well...I'm sorry.

20:27.067 --> 20:29.570
I was just trying to get
rid of that old, stupid car.

20:29.603 --> 20:31.238
And you said, "I'm desperate,
Mr. Brown."

20:31.272 --> 20:33.841
You practically started
throwing money at me.

20:33.874 --> 20:36.310
So, I just sold it to you.

20:36.343 --> 20:39.480
- Okay, I mean, I can admit
I was a little bit overzealous.

20:39.513 --> 20:41.181
- Thank you.
- But that don't give you

20:41.215 --> 20:42.583
no excuse, man.

20:42.616 --> 20:43.917
- Well, I'm gonna make it
right.

20:43.951 --> 20:46.253
I'm gonna go page Cleophus--

20:46.287 --> 20:48.555
- I'm not messing with
your shade tree mechanic.

20:48.589 --> 20:49.990
