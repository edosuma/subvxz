         You don't know anything
                    about sales.

00:10.778 --> 00:12.177
            It requires 20 years
                     experience.

00:12.179 --> 00:13.379
       You are forgetting
    how charming I would be

00:13.381 --> 00:15.080
     In the job interview.
           Circle it.

00:15.082 --> 00:16.749
Stop saying "circle it," 'cause
   there's nothing to circle.

00:16.751 --> 00:18.584
           Circle it.
  Just circle it and move on.

00:18.586 --> 00:20.419
              All right, listen,
       you don't have experience

00:20.421 --> 00:21.754
          To do any of the stuff
           that you highlighted.

                      Seriously?

00:26.027 --> 00:27.326
All right, it was
a little bit of a stretch.

00:27.328 --> 00:30.262
But to be fair, those planes
are on autopilot a lot.

00:30.264 --> 00:32.131
          - Honestly.
         - I got to go.

00:32.133 --> 00:33.332
       - What? Don't go.
        - You know what?

00:33.334 --> 00:35.167
 I just don't know what happened
                    to the song.

00:35.169 --> 00:36.502
      The producer said he liked
                       the hook.

00:36.504 --> 00:38.237
  Why did we even hound that guy
             in the first place?

00:38.239 --> 00:40.272
    - Listen, it's great...
       - Oh, I got to go.

00:40.274 --> 00:41.540
But even if he likes it,

00:41.542 --> 00:42.641
It doesn't mean I'm gonna be
making any money soon.

00:42.643 --> 00:44.576
I need cash now,
even if it means

00:44.578 --> 00:47.212
Working one of these boring
regular-person jobs.

00:47.214 --> 00:48.447
As a point of reference,

00:48.449 --> 00:50.516
How much does laurie pay you
to watch the kids?

00:50.518 --> 00:52.418
                        Nothing,
       because they are my kids.

00:52.420 --> 00:55.254
Seems like a raw deal.

00:55.256 --> 00:57.189
All right.

00:57.191 --> 00:59.058
     I, uh...

       Marcus is learning
          the maracas.

01:07.368 --> 01:09.768
Okay, you know,
I got so many questions,

01:09.770 --> 01:11.537
But I guess I'll just go
with the usual.

01:11.539 --> 01:12.638
        Why?

01:12.640 --> 01:14.540
      Quick, quick, slow.

            my hip action, will?

Oh, I can't answer that,

who could later testify.

01:21.248 --> 01:22.848
Okay, marcus,

Tomorrow we'll go over
the 2:3 polyrhythm technique.

Same time tomorrow.

Wait, you're paying her
to teach him the maracas?

01:44.338 --> 01:46.171
   For your information, sir,
          the maracas

01:46.173 --> 01:48.207
   Are a deceiving instrument
            to play.

01:48.209 --> 01:49.808
Okay, no disrespect,
but babies play them.

01:49.810 --> 01:51.243
   Yeah, no, you're thinking
          of a rattle.

01:51.245 --> 01:53.512
And you're thinking
that there's a difference.

01:53.514 --> 01:54.513
Wait a minute here.

how to play a cool instrument,

02:01.355 --> 02:03.255

                    of yourself.

that splendidly.

           like a piece of meat.

and the girls who are judged.

                having any flaw.

05:51.085 --> 05:52.351
                    Intelligent.

05:52.353 --> 05:53.752
And a bulky back brace.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.387
         This is getting harder.

05:55.389 --> 05:58.757
              Listen, you're not
       in middle school anymore.

05:58.759 --> 06:00.826
      Go to that meeting tonight
         and show them the fiona

06:00.828 --> 06:02.027
                  You are today.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.862
            Maybe if you embrace
            some of their ideas,

06:03.864 --> 06:06.865
                    Giving birth
  to a wonderful new friendship.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.101
                   Come here.
                      Mm.

06:09.103 --> 06:10.702
                   Hmm.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.604
Yeah, you still do have a little
         curve there, don't you?

06:12.606 --> 06:15.006
     - Yeah, it's my bump.
      - I love your bump.

06:15.008 --> 06:18.377
You know, if this guitar-lesson
thing doesn't work out,

06:18.379 --> 06:20.379
I know something else
you're pretty good at.

06:20.381 --> 06:22.781
          You think? Yeah, well,
     you're not so bad yourself.

06:22.783 --> 06:25.917
[chuckles]
oh...

06:25.919 --> 06:29.388
For tessa's lesson.

06:29.390 --> 06:30.422
You think you can
do it again tomorrow?

06:30.424 --> 06:31.656
             Oh, uh, yeah, sure.

06:31.658 --> 06:34.059
                 Tomorrow works,
          but this is a lot of--

06:34.061 --> 06:35.394
            - Great.
          - All right.

06:35.396 --> 06:36.628
      - I'll see you then.
            - Okay.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.096
              Ooh!

06:44.470 --> 06:44.703
               .

06:44.705 --> 06:48.173
Does she not understand
how the system

06:48.175 --> 06:49.841
Of american currency works?

06:49.843 --> 06:52.477
     I guess she--I don't know--
            thinks I'm worth it.

06:52.479 --> 06:55.847
                 After all, I am
   a celebrity recording artist.

06:55.849 --> 06:56.915
      <i> [cuban pete</i> playing]

06:56.917 --> 06:58.083
   ¶ when I start to dance ¶

06:58.085 --> 06:59.751
       ¶ everything goes

              ¶ ¶

07:03.657 --> 07:04.723
It doesn't make any sense.

07:04.725 --> 07:06.491
                 [coughs]

07:06.493 --> 07:08.593
What's going on
with your hair?

07:08.595 --> 07:09.861
                            Huh?

07:09.863 --> 07:11.997
You have sex hair.

07:11.999 --> 07:15.033
And you're drinking a postcoital
restorative beverage.

07:15.035 --> 07:17.903
You had sex with that woman.

07:17.905 --> 07:20.772
   - This is payment for sex.
            - What?

07:20.774 --> 07:22.707
You are
a male prostitute.

07:22.709 --> 07:23.809
                           Whoa!

07:23.811 --> 07:26.445
          What's wrong with you?
                   Give me that.

07:26.447 --> 07:28.680
       - Look, okay, yes.
           - Uh-huh.

07:28.682 --> 07:30.215
        I did have sex with her,

07:30.217 --> 07:32.751
                 But that is not
            what I was paid for.

07:32.753 --> 07:34.553
            - Mm-mm.
      - It's unbelievable.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.054
You get to have sex
with any woman that you want,

07:36.056 --> 07:37.055
And now you're gonna get paid
for it.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.991
           Again, I was not paid
                        for sex.

07:39.993 --> 07:42.227
By the way,
that's low for a ho.

07:42.229 --> 07:44.129
                  I was not paid
                  for sex, okay?

07:44.131 --> 07:46.164
     - Can we just drop it?
          - Prove it.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.866
Go back and give the kid
a guitar lesson.

07:47.868 --> 07:51.703
If she pays you the same amount,
then I apologize.

07:51.705 --> 07:52.838
I stand corrected.

07:52.840 --> 07:53.939
                           Okay.

07:53.941 --> 07:55.874
      I won't have sex with her.

07:55.876 --> 07:58.910
Good.

07:58.912 --> 08:01.847
           I hope you appreciate
        the things I do for you.

08:01.849 --> 08:05.050
           [laughter]

08:05.052 --> 08:08.620
            Fiona, that necklace
                 is so striking.

08:08.622 --> 08:10.188
    I don't think I've ever seen
              one quite like it.

08:10.190 --> 08:11.690
It's actually not
a necklace.

08:11.692 --> 08:14.192
It's an indonesian
menstrual chart.

08:14.194 --> 08:18.029
And each bead represents
a cycle in--

08:18.031 --> 08:19.831
Don't worry.
It's boring, sorry.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.733
     Are you kidding? You're the
   most interesting person here.

08:21.735 --> 08:23.802
    - No offense, everybody.
         - None taken.

08:23.804 --> 08:25.537
The closest I've been
to indonesia

08:25.539 --> 08:28.006
Is ordering a chai latte
at starbucks.

08:28.008 --> 08:31.810
That's actually from india,
but I totally get what you mean.

08:31.812 --> 08:35.947
  Next time we need to hear more
     about your time in England.

08:35.948 --> 08:37.948
                  And your other
                 menses jewelry.

08:37.951 --> 08:40.684
Next time?
Okay.

08:40.687 --> 08:43.755
        Okay, so getting down to
  a little fund-raiser business,

08:43.756 --> 08:46.591
              We do need to pick
   the seventh-grade class song.

08:46.593 --> 08:47.792
       And, listen, nobody loves

08:47.794 --> 08:49.794
       Their bey, jay, and kanye
                   more than me,

08:49.796 --> 08:52.564
               But I think those
   are for private minivan jams.

08:52.566 --> 08:56.001
   Any of the offensive songs
      our kids suggested.

08:56.003 --> 08:57.802
             - No.
        - There was one

08:57.804 --> 09:00.705
Non-offensive song that
I think a student suggested.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.741
It was <i> cuban pete.</i>

09:02.743 --> 09:07.712
  I think everyone was under the
impression that that was a joke.

09:07.714 --> 09:08.780
              I mean, wasn't it?

09:08.782 --> 09:10.882
I don't know.

09:10.884 --> 09:14.185
           Because I think doing
          something so peculiar,

09:14.187 --> 09:15.620
                   It might lead
                    to bullying.

09:15.622 --> 09:16.755
           - So true.
       - Social suicide.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.056
                Yeah, land mine.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.925
You know what? I'd never thought
about it like that,

09:19.927 --> 09:21.993
But, I mean, that is
quite a good point, isn't it?

09:21.995 --> 09:23.862
       What if we pick something
           a little bit more fun

09:23.864 --> 09:25.630
               And contemporary?

09:25.632 --> 09:28.567
            Ooh! What about that
     sara bareilles song,<i> brave?</i>

09:28.569 --> 09:31.236
    ¶ say what you want to say ¶

09:31.238 --> 09:35.073
              All:
 ¶ and let the words fall out ¶

09:35.075 --> 09:39.177
          ¶ honestly,
  I want to see you be brave ¶

09:39.179 --> 09:41.746
I love that song.
So catchy!

09:41.748 --> 09:43.682
            (fiona)
        well done, you!

09:48.154 --> 09:49.688
             - Hey.
           - Oh, no!

09:49.690 --> 09:50.789
             Oh, tessa's lesson!

09:50.791 --> 09:52.857
                     Um, I was--
               I totally forgot.

09:52.859 --> 09:54.859
     I--she's at her dad's place
                  for the night.

09:54.861 --> 09:56.361
Why don't--
I'll just come back tomorrow.

09:56.363 --> 09:57.629
                    Oh, perfect.
                      Thank you.

09:57.631 --> 09:58.630
        - I'm so sorry.
            - Okay.

09:58.632 --> 09:59.965
Yeah, no.
No worries.

09:59.967 --> 10:03.001
     You know, since you're here
                and tessa's not,

10:03.003 --> 10:06.104
     Maybe you'd like to come in
            for a glass of wine.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.772
And by wine,
do you mean--

10:07.774 --> 10:09.207
                Forget the wine.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.343
Mm. Okay.

10:13.079 --> 10:14.713
Wait.
Hold on a second.

10:14.715 --> 10:18.149
There's definitely not gonna be
a guitar lesson?

10:18.151 --> 10:21.286
               Will, your guitar
           is not the instrument

10:21.288 --> 10:22.954
              I'm interested in.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.723
            - I see.
           - Mm-hmm.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.124
                       [squeals]

10:26.126 --> 10:28.960
   - Let's go upstairs, huh?
    - Oh, I like your style.

10:30.663 --> 10:33.231
Which one of these hats do you
like for <i> cuban pete?</i>

10:33.233 --> 10:34.733
You know, my gut says
the porkpie hat,

10:34.735 --> 10:36.401
Because the fedora
has been tragically co-opted

10:36.403 --> 10:37.769
By the unshaven
hipster crowd.

10:37.771 --> 10:40.171
                        Darling,
              can I have a word?

10:40.173 --> 10:42.240
              Will you sit down?

10:45.711 --> 10:48.179
So, um...

10:48.181 --> 10:51.383
Your class won't be performing
<i>cuban pete</i> tomorrow night.

10:51.385 --> 10:52.651
                      What? Why?

10:52.653 --> 10:53.818
You know I appreciate

10:53.820 --> 10:55.887
How you both literally
and figuratively dance

10:55.889 --> 10:57.889
To the beat
of your own drum.

10:57.891 --> 11:00.892
But there are some people
who might think

11:00.894 --> 11:02.394
That a group
of 12-year-olds dancing

11:02.396 --> 11:05.864
To a 60-year-old rumba song
is a bit odd.

11:05.866 --> 11:09.067
                 It's the rumba,
       not the friggin' foxtrot.

11:09.069 --> 11:11.803
I know, but sometimes
we have to embrace the ideas

11:11.805 --> 11:13.738
Of other people
in order to fit in.

11:13.740 --> 11:15.674
                  But what about
               our family motto?

11:15.676 --> 11:16.675
            "we don't fit in..."

11:16.677 --> 11:20.745
I know, but sometimes you have
to try to fit in a bit.

11:20.747 --> 11:21.946
You know?

11:23.983 --> 11:25.817
                           Fine.

11:25.819 --> 11:28.386
     I'll do any song they want.

11:28.388 --> 11:33.091
    And I'll March off the cliff
    with all the other lemmings.

11:33.093 --> 11:35.026
And just to be clear,
the lemming/cliff thing

11:35.028 --> 11:38.263
Is just hyperbole and not any
indication that I may self-harm.

11:38.265 --> 11:40.365
                     Okay, good.

11:42.268 --> 11:43.902
[sighs]
thank you again.

11:43.904 --> 11:45.103
               Thank you.

11:45.105 --> 11:47.772
And I'm really sorry
about the mix-up.

11:47.774 --> 11:49.240
                   Oh, I'm sorry
                 about the lamp.

11:49.242 --> 11:51.409
  Things got a little wild there
                     at the end.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.812
[laughs]
I always hated that lamp.

11:53.814 --> 11:56.147
            Oh, I almost forgot.

11:56.149 --> 11:57.449
[grunts]

11:57.451 --> 12:00.018
                      All right.

12:00.020 --> 12:03.722
I definitely did not give tessa
a guitar lesson.

12:03.724 --> 12:05.290
        Right, but I should have
                      cancelled.

12:05.292 --> 12:08.126
 It's kind of standard procedure
         that a teacher get paid

12:08.128 --> 12:10.095
    When a client doesn't cancel
          within 24 hours, so...

12:10.097 --> 12:12.731
Oh, well, I feel weird
about taking this.

12:12.733 --> 12:15.500
                     Oh, please.
I have to pay you for your time.

12:25.144 --> 12:25.376
               .

12:25.378 --> 12:28.980
You did not give the daughter
a guitar lesson.

12:28.982 --> 12:30.415
But you did have sex
with the mom.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.784
           - Mm-hmm.
   - And you got paid for it.

12:32.786 --> 12:33.985
           - Mm-hmm.
     - How is this unclear?

12:33.987 --> 12:39.124
A two-bit hussy.
A <i> pretty woman,</i> if you will.

12:39.126 --> 12:40.458
What are you doing?

12:40.460 --> 12:41.960
              Proving you wrong.

12:41.962 --> 12:43.828
             I am gonna ask emma
                  out on a date.

12:43.830 --> 12:45.463
                     Prostitutes
            don't ask women out.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.098
              And they don't pay
               for dates, right?

12:47.100 --> 12:48.900
            So, if she says yes,
                      I'm right.

12:48.902 --> 12:50.168
        [line trilling]
         - big mistake.

12:50.170 --> 12:51.870
          - Big. Huge.
             - Shh.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.139
                     Watch this.

12:54.141 --> 12:56.174
     Hello?

12:56.176 --> 12:58.109
                       Hi, emma.
              It's will freeman.

12:58.111 --> 13:01.980
  Listen, I was wondering if you
wanted to go out tomorrow night.

13:01.982 --> 13:03.214
          Dinner, maybe a movie?

13:03.216 --> 13:04.282
Oh, I'd like that.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.818
                          Great.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.520
Oh, actually, you know what?
I can't.

13:08.522 --> 13:10.889
I have this school fund-raiser
thing tomorrow night.

13:10.891 --> 13:13.525
Unless you'd like
to join me?

13:13.527 --> 13:15.293
    That sounds like a fun date.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.462
Awesome. And it's
kind of a formal event,

13:17.464 --> 13:19.164
So do you have a tux?

13:19.166 --> 13:21.499
You can be my escort.

13:21.501 --> 13:22.901
                 Your what, now?

13:22.903 --> 13:24.235
Oh, you know,
I just had such a great idea.

13:24.237 --> 13:26.437
There's this bachelor auction
at the event,

13:26.439 --> 13:29.274
And I bet people would pay
big money for you.

13:29.276 --> 13:32.343
    Will I dress up in a tuxedo,
                  go up onstage,

13:32.345 --> 13:35.814
          And be bid on by women
                    on our date?

13:35.816 --> 13:37.015
                       Uh, sure.

13:37.017 --> 13:38.049
             Great.

13:38.051 --> 13:39.384
           Okay, bye.

13:39.386 --> 13:44.122
[deep voice] want me to go
with you and make sure she pays?

13:44.124 --> 13:45.924
[normal voice]
that's what a pimp would say.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.292
                      [chuckles]
      that's a pretty good pimp.

13:47.294 --> 13:48.827
Thanks.

13:48.829 --> 13:50.929
             This is a fun date.
    I've been on a lot of dates.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.831
           This is the best date
           in a long, long time.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.299
      - Let's get a drink,
     - yeah, I'd love that.

13:54.301 --> 13:56.000
     All right, here we go.
         Got my wallet.

13:56.002 --> 13:57.168
           Oh, no, no, why don't
                you let me pay--

13:57.170 --> 13:58.336
You're not paying
for anything.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.838
You've already paid
for the limousine,

13:59.840 --> 14:00.939
Which was surprising.

14:00.941 --> 14:02.140
And then you paid
for these cufflinks,

14:02.142 --> 14:05.276
Which was a little bit weird.

14:05.278 --> 14:06.845
But I can't let you pay
for everything.

14:06.847 --> 14:08.546
              No, I'm not paying
                 for everything.

14:08.548 --> 14:10.481
                Mr. O'connor is.

14:10.483 --> 14:12.250
        Can I get two red wines,
                         please.

14:12.252 --> 14:14.052
I don't even like red wine.

14:14.054 --> 14:16.087
                   Oh, excuse me
        for just a second, okay?

14:16.089 --> 14:17.622
       - Yeah, all right.
     - I'll be right back.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.424
All right, great.

14:19.426 --> 14:20.625
             Was that your john?

14:20.627 --> 14:21.893
You stop it right now.

14:21.895 --> 14:23.962
Honestly, she's paying
for everything.

14:23.964 --> 14:26.231
She's ordering for me.
I got to drink red wine now.

14:26.233 --> 14:28.066
The whole thing
is messing me up.

14:28.068 --> 14:30.001
Honestly, I think
maybe I am a prostitute.

14:30.003 --> 14:32.604
    That's what I've been saying
               this entire time.

14:32.606 --> 14:35.206
Let's just think
through this thing, okay?

14:35.208 --> 14:37.041
Maybe it's not such a bad idea,
all right?

14:37.043 --> 14:38.977
I'm looking for a job.

14:38.979 --> 14:41.079
Sex is something I have 20 years
experience with.

14:41.081 --> 14:42.881
         - 20? Really?
            - Yeah.

14:42.883 --> 14:44.649
You know, I think
I'd probably have to get

14:44.651 --> 14:47.085
A few more
deep v-necks going.

14:47.087 --> 14:48.653
           - Bronzer.
        - Frost my tips.

14:48.655 --> 14:53.057
Just get the body spray going
all day, all over the place.

14:53.059 --> 14:55.360
   Definitely work on your pecs.
 That's what you need help with.

14:55.362 --> 14:56.995
What?

14:56.997 --> 14:59.597
I don't know, man.

14:59.599 --> 15:01.666
Getting paid for sex,

15:01.668 --> 15:03.601
It's like, what else
am I capable of?

15:03.603 --> 15:06.604
I won't even--I don't even know
who I am anymore.

15:06.606 --> 15:10.408
        - Mr. O'connor?
    - That's me, thank you.

15:10.410 --> 15:11.609
[sighs]

15:11.611 --> 15:14.612

15:14.614 --> 15:17.982
              ¶ ¶

15:17.984 --> 15:20.585
Um, why is everybody
looking at us?

15:20.587 --> 15:22.487
Is my skirt tucked
into my knickers?

15:22.489 --> 15:23.955
            No, you're good.

15:23.957 --> 15:28.559
               Fiona, I'm loving
        the hair and that dress.

15:28.561 --> 15:31.596
 Of course, you can wear
 a column with your legs.

15:31.598 --> 15:34.065
I could never pull it off
 with these tree stumps.

15:34.067 --> 15:36.167
Oh, no, don't say that
about yourself.

15:36.169 --> 15:38.136
                We all want what
           we don't have, right?

15:38.138 --> 15:41.973
I always say,
"compare and despair."

15:41.975 --> 15:44.509
      And by what we don't have,
               I mean mr. Chris.

15:44.511 --> 15:46.477
                We all want him,
     and you got him, you bitch.

15:46.479 --> 15:47.645
           [laughter]

15:47.647 --> 15:49.414
Oh.
[chuckles nervously]

15:49.416 --> 15:52.050
Yeah, no, I saw him first,
you bitch.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.418
      [all gasp and laugh]

15:53.420 --> 15:54.953
God, I don't mean that
in the offensive way, obviously.

15:54.955 --> 15:56.988
I just mean,
like, bitch!

15:56.990 --> 15:58.523
It's actually
quite fun to say.

15:58.525 --> 16:00.158
Bitch!
I can't stop.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.694
[laughing]
oh, my god.

16:02.696 --> 16:03.995
Hold on.
I'll be right back.

16:03.997 --> 16:05.063
        Oh, no, no, no.
            No, you-

16:05.065 --> 16:08.199
          (all) hello.
       - Hi, hi, hi. Hi.

16:08.201 --> 16:10.101
Oy, what are you
doing here?

16:10.103 --> 16:12.103
   Funny story, he's trying
  to prove he's not a pros--

16:12.105 --> 16:13.604
                 I am on a date,

16:13.606 --> 16:15.673
                     Just a date
       with a lady friend, emma.

16:15.675 --> 16:18.977
          Or potentially illegal
                  going on here.

16:18.979 --> 16:21.412
     Excuse me. I'm sorry,
I need to auction will off now.

16:21.414 --> 16:24.415
                          (emma)
                       this way.

16:24.417 --> 16:25.717
          Don't worry.
        I got your back.

16:25.719 --> 16:26.751
               Bottoms up, andy.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.720
Wait. I thought
he wasn't drinking

16:28.722 --> 16:31.055
In solidarity with you.
You know...

16:31.057 --> 16:32.757
          My hormones are raging
                      right now.

16:32.759 --> 16:33.758
Oh.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.093
                Andy gets handsy
                 when he drinks,

16:35.095 --> 16:37.762
            And honestly, fiona,
              mama needs handsy.

16:37.764 --> 16:40.665
             - Yes.
          - Real bad.

16:40.667 --> 16:44.369
And a hearty <i> muchos gracias </i>
to chef rodriguez.

16:44.371 --> 16:46.004
Thank you, chef.

16:46.006 --> 16:48.039
                  Okay, next up,
               we have a package

16:48.041 --> 16:50.274
     Of five guitar lessons
     given by will freeman.

16:50.276 --> 16:52.143
(chris)
let's start
the bidding at $50.

16:52.145 --> 16:53.277
             $100.

16:53.279 --> 16:54.712
$100.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.447
                        (joanne)
             where did emma find
            that little boy toy?

16:56.449 --> 16:58.149
    He teaches her daughter
            guitar.

16:58.151 --> 16:59.183
"guitar."

16:59.185 --> 17:01.119
       Oh, god, are you serious?

17:01.121 --> 17:02.320
               That is just sad.

17:02.322 --> 17:04.589
         I don't think
       we should assume.

17:04.590 --> 17:05.757
(chris)
do I hear 200? $200?

17:05.759 --> 17:06.758
             $200.

17:06.760 --> 17:08.259
(chris)
$200 from the lady in red.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.194
          Could she be
      any more desperate?

17:10.195 --> 17:11.262
Painful.

17:11.263 --> 17:13.031
                 Someone text me
                 when it's over.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.732
Well, you know, all the money's
  going to the kids, isn't it?

17:14.733 --> 17:16.034
           It's good.

17:16.036 --> 17:17.167
I've got $300.
I'm looking for $400.

17:17.170 --> 17:18.736
$400 for this tall drink
of water.

17:18.738 --> 17:19.737
I've got $400.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.138
Do I hear 500?
$500?

17:21.141 --> 17:22.406

17:26.346 --> 17:27.377
              Oh.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.747
I'm a celebrity
recording artist.

17:29.749 --> 17:32.583
          Oh, my god.

    ¶ you can turn a phrase
   into a weapon or a drug ¶

17:47.634 --> 17:50.435
    ¶ you can be the outcast
      or be the backlash ¶

17:50.437 --> 17:54.505
 ¶ of somebody's lack of love ¶

17:54.507 --> 17:57.775
       ¶ or you can start
         speaking up ¶

                         $2,000?

18:03.216 --> 18:05.316
- That's a lot of money.
- And for what?

18:05.318 --> 18:08.119
                  You know what?
I-I got to say something to her.

18:08.121 --> 18:11.155
           This has got to stop.
    It's gone on too far, right?

18:11.157 --> 18:12.490
                         I mean,
           I got some integrity.

18:12.492 --> 18:14.325
            - Yeah.
      - Can I get a beer?

18:14.327 --> 18:16.160
                You can put that
                on mr. O'connor.

18:16.162 --> 18:18.663
         I mean, first
    her husband leaves her.

18:18.665 --> 18:21.199
  Then she's reduced to buying
     herself a prostitute?

18:21.201 --> 18:23.334
               I heard she spent
            a fortune renovating

18:23.336 --> 18:26.504
         Her downstairs bedroom,
        if you know what I mean.

18:26.506 --> 18:29.273
She should do her upstairs.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.242
      - I mean the boobs.
           (both) oh.

18:31.244 --> 18:33.578
  It's a little middle school
     of you all, isn't it,

18:33.580 --> 18:35.379
    I mean, to be gossiping
     about emma like that?

18:35.381 --> 18:37.515
                      Well, duh,
         we're in middle school.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.150
           [laughter]

18:39.152 --> 18:41.819
    Do you have any idea what it
  actually feels like to be her?

18:41.821 --> 18:43.588
        What it feels like to be
                        a leper?

18:43.590 --> 18:45.423
                  To be too tall
                  or too strange

18:45.425 --> 18:49.160
                 Or, god forbid,
           too slutty to belong?

18:49.162 --> 18:51.429
                           I do.

18:51.431 --> 18:54.499
            Not the slutty part,
         but more the other two.

18:54.501 --> 18:56.701
     But, anyway, you've done me
              an enormous favor,

18:56.703 --> 18:58.536
 Because I always wanted to know
               what it felt like

18:58.538 --> 19:00.271
             To be on the inside
           of the popular group.

19:00.273 --> 19:04.375
     And now that I know, I have
   absolutely no interest in it.

19:04.377 --> 19:06.244
         Oh, and another thing--

19:06.246 --> 19:08.579
        The man that she bought,
          he's not a prostitute.

19:08.581 --> 19:13.885
             And he would never,
      ever sell himself for sex.

19:13.887 --> 19:14.886
             (all)
  ¶ I wanna see you be brave ¶

19:14.888 --> 19:18.156
I'm not having sex
with you for money anymore.

19:18.158 --> 19:19.624
         [all gasping]

19:19.626 --> 19:21.192
                 Oh, he said it.

19:21.194 --> 19:23.394
                Excuse me?

19:23.396 --> 19:26.664
           [applause]

19:26.666 --> 19:29.267
I am not a prostitute.

19:29.269 --> 19:32.370
                        [scoffs]
   I was not paying you for sex.

19:32.372 --> 19:33.638
       I mean, I might have been
                  overpaying you

19:33.640 --> 19:35.239
             For guitar lessons,
         but that's just because

19:35.241 --> 19:37.909
        I look for opportunities
 to spend my ex-husband's money.

19:37.911 --> 19:39.911
Well, then how do you
explain the sex?

19:39.913 --> 19:42.346
         - I liked you.
        [crowd gasping]

19:42.348 --> 19:44.315
                           Jerk!

19:44.317 --> 19:46.884
       [women snickering]

19:46.886 --> 19:49.820
This was a night
to remember.

19:49.822 --> 19:52.657
[exhales deeply]

19:52.659 --> 19:56.327
         Darling, I was wrong...

19:56.329 --> 19:59.297
                About asking you
         to follow the lemmings.

19:59.299 --> 20:01.799
      It is important to be part
                 of a community.

20:01.801 --> 20:05.436
      But a community is made up
                of individuals--

20:05.438 --> 20:08.773
          Unique, funny, lovely,
                      brilliant,

20:08.775 --> 20:11.375
       Rumba-loving individuals.

20:11.377 --> 20:12.810
  And if you're still up for it,

20:12.812 --> 20:15.646
          I, for one, would love
  to see you perform <i> cuban pete.</i>

20:15.648 --> 20:16.948
       Yes!

20:16.950 --> 20:19.917

          Just out of curiosity,

20:49.282 --> 20:51.816
                        How much
         for your guitar lesson?

20:51.818 --> 20:53.517
                     One lesson.
                      No guitar.

20:53.519 --> 20:55.253
      Eh, I pass.

20:55.255 --> 20:56.721
          Hold those.
           Thank you.
