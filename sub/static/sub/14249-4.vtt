WEBVTT

00:11.845 --> 00:13.745
Oh, sir...

00:13.813 --> 00:16.714
we, um... we're just...

00:16.783 --> 00:18.614
Yes, l can see that.

00:24.057 --> 00:25.581
What was that all about?

00:25.658 --> 00:26.955
l'd call it an example

00:27.027 --> 00:29.393
of indiscreet shipboard
fraternization.

00:29.462 --> 00:30.394
Really?

00:30.463 --> 00:31.657
Sorry l missed it.

00:31.731 --> 00:33.255
Deck 6.

00:38.505 --> 00:39.870
Thank you for your help, Tom.

00:39.939 --> 00:41.201
Yeah. See you later.

00:41.274 --> 00:42.206
Right.

00:45.812 --> 00:47.780
Here's the cabbage
you asked for.

00:47.847 --> 00:49.872
ls something wrong?

00:54.287 --> 00:55.777
What's this?

00:55.855 --> 00:58.255
A spawn beetle.

00:58.324 --> 01:01.157
Oh, they cross-pollinate
the Oblissian cabbage.

01:01.227 --> 01:05.391
Have you ever seen
such fascinating striations?

01:05.465 --> 01:08.901
Oh, isn't it beautiful?

01:08.968 --> 01:10.526
l doubt the Captain
would think so

01:10.603 --> 01:13.333
if she found it crawling around
in her salad.

01:15.675 --> 01:17.768
There is something wrong.

01:17.844 --> 01:18.970
What is it?

01:19.045 --> 01:19.977
No, nothing.

01:20.046 --> 01:21.513
l'm just very busy.

01:25.018 --> 01:29.717
So, you're seeing
Tom Paris later.

01:29.789 --> 01:30.847
What?

01:30.924 --> 01:32.949
No, not that l know of.

01:35.161 --> 01:37.459
He said, ''See you later.''

01:37.530 --> 01:39.691
You said, ''Right.''

01:39.766 --> 01:42.735
ls he helping you
in the airponics bay now?

01:42.802 --> 01:45.100
He was just helping me
carry these.

01:46.172 --> 01:47.161
How thoughtful.

01:47.240 --> 01:48.935
Neelix, this is getting
ridiculous.

01:49.008 --> 01:51.033
You're imagining things
that aren't there.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.136
You're such an innocent!

01:54.848 --> 01:57.646
l see the way he looks at you.

01:57.717 --> 01:59.150
l used to look at women
that way.

01:59.219 --> 02:00.481
l know what it means.

02:00.553 --> 02:03.886
Janeway to the senior staff.
Please report to the Bridge.

02:06.226 --> 02:07.557
Take care.

02:15.768 --> 02:17.759
Thank you for bringing
the cabbage.

02:17.837 --> 02:19.532
l can handle this from here,
thank you.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:29.983 --> 02:31.848
We've detected
a strange energy configuration

02:31.918 --> 02:32.907
off the port bow.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.749
Any idea what it is?

02:34.821 --> 02:37.119
lt appears to be some sort
of magnetic disturbance.

02:37.190 --> 02:39.055
We're going to take
a closer look.

02:43.429 --> 02:46.091
You seem a little preoccupied,
Commander.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.895
This morning,
l interrupted a couple

02:47.967 --> 02:49.594
who were kissing
in the turbolift.

02:49.669 --> 02:52.263
And l've been wondering
if we should establish

02:52.338 --> 02:56.035
a policy regarding...
fraternization.

02:56.109 --> 02:58.509
Well...

02:58.578 --> 03:01.411
the couple in question
might be urged

03:01.481 --> 03:03.244
to show a bit more discretion,

03:03.316 --> 03:05.910
but Starfleet has always
been reluctant

03:05.985 --> 03:08.317
to regulate
people's personal lives.

03:08.388 --> 03:10.822
Of course, but we're in
a unique situation here.

03:10.890 --> 03:13.518
The development
of intimate relationships

03:13.593 --> 03:16.619
might cause us problems that
wouldn't arise in other ships.

03:16.696 --> 03:20.257
l understand
what you're saying, but...

03:20.333 --> 03:22.893
we're a long way from home.

03:22.969 --> 03:26.769
Everyone is lonely,
and all we have is each other.

03:26.839 --> 03:30.434
l think, eventually,
people will begin to pair off.

03:30.510 --> 03:32.603
lncluding you?

03:35.181 --> 03:38.708
As Captain, that's a luxury
l don't have.

03:38.785 --> 03:43.984
Besides, l intend for us
to be home before...

03:44.057 --> 03:45.752
before Mark
gives me up for dead.

03:45.825 --> 03:47.986
We're in visual range,
Captain.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.995
On screen.

03:56.636 --> 03:59.969
Looks like some type
of energetic vapor.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.540
Magnify.

04:05.578 --> 04:07.068
Space-dwelling life-forms.

04:07.146 --> 04:08.204
Full sensor scan, Mr. Kim.

04:08.281 --> 04:09.213
Their internal

04:09.282 --> 04:11.079
energy patterns appear
to be consistent

04:11.150 --> 04:12.617
with discrete organic processes.

04:12.685 --> 04:15.483
Captain, l'd like the chance
to study them at close range.

04:15.555 --> 04:17.182
So would l, Commander.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.156
But let's not get too close.

04:19.225 --> 04:21.159
We wouldn't want to disturb
their natural behavior.

04:21.226 --> 04:23.161
Half impulse, Mr. Paris.

04:23.229 --> 04:24.856
Take us into bio-scanner range.

04:24.931 --> 04:26.296
Aye, Captain.

07:05.491 --> 07:07.391
The swarm is not
particularly dense, Captain.

07:07.460 --> 07:09.860
l estimate their number
at fewer than 2,000.

07:09.929 --> 07:11.191
They're really moving.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.196
He's right.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.857
They've accelerated
to a velocity

07:13.966 --> 07:16.662
of approximately
1,000 kilometers per second.

07:16.736 --> 07:17.998
lt's possible
we're frightening them.

07:18.070 --> 07:19.298
Keep us within scanner range,

07:19.372 --> 07:21.806
Lieutenant, but try
to avoid rapid acceleration.

07:21.874 --> 07:22.863
Aye, Captain.

07:23.009 --> 07:24.101
Take a look at this.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.145
See the way they
propel themselves?

07:31.284 --> 07:35.050
They seem to flagellate,
almost like protozoa.

07:35.121 --> 07:38.386
Exactly, but they're
achieving incredible speeds--

07:38.458 --> 07:40.926
over 3,000 kilometers
per second.

07:40.993 --> 07:42.221
Ensign Wildman,

07:42.295 --> 07:44.286
scan the field
for repeating patterns.

07:44.363 --> 07:46.388
Maybe they're capable
of some type of communication.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.490
Aye, Captain.

07:47.567 --> 07:49.330
Their internal anatomy's
also very unusual.

07:49.402 --> 07:52.371
They don't appear to have a
digestive system of any kind,

07:52.438 --> 07:54.633
but they have an extremely
porous outer covering.

07:54.707 --> 07:55.674
My guess would be

07:55.741 --> 07:58.301
that they absorb nutrients
directly from space.

07:58.377 --> 07:59.867
lncredible.

07:59.946 --> 08:01.379
A space-dwelling life-form

08:01.481 --> 08:03.881
capable of metabolizing
inorganic matter.

08:03.916 --> 08:05.110
Particle density

08:05.184 --> 08:06.845
in this part of space
isn't very high.

08:06.953 --> 08:09.751
That might explain why they
have to keep moving so fast.

08:09.822 --> 08:12.450
Feeding at 3,000
kilometers per second.

08:12.525 --> 08:14.993
Not exactly leisurely dining,
is it?

08:36.448 --> 08:37.438
Come in.

08:44.155 --> 08:46.283
For you, sweeting.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.054
Thank you.

08:48.127 --> 08:50.618
Hmm... what's the occasion?

08:50.696 --> 08:52.664
Oh, no occasion.

08:52.732 --> 08:57.226
l... l just wanted to apologize.

08:57.303 --> 08:59.066
Apologize?

08:59.138 --> 09:02.005
For the way l acted
in the Mess Hall.

09:02.074 --> 09:05.271
l-l was jealous.

09:05.344 --> 09:06.936
l know.

09:07.013 --> 09:08.844
l just wish you could trust me.

09:08.915 --> 09:11.941
lt has nothing to do
with trusting you.

09:12.018 --> 09:14.111
lt's him l don't trust.

09:14.186 --> 09:15.551
l've seen his kind before.

09:15.621 --> 09:18.283
They're all over the Quadrant,
as a matter of fact.

09:18.357 --> 09:22.851
They prey on naive, sheltered
young women like you.

09:22.929 --> 09:24.055
What are you looking for?

09:24.130 --> 09:25.324
A vase.

09:25.398 --> 09:25.989
Don't!

09:27.833 --> 09:29.357
What's this?

09:29.435 --> 09:30.993
Nothing. Just a snack.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.705
A Terran delicacy.

09:33.773 --> 09:36.640
Ensign Wildman told me about it.

09:36.709 --> 09:38.643
Mashed potatoes with butter.

09:38.711 --> 09:40.474
lt's delicious.

09:40.546 --> 09:42.946
Would you like to try it?

09:47.320 --> 09:48.685
Ugh. Awful.

09:48.754 --> 09:50.346
How can you eat it?

09:50.423 --> 09:52.118
l can't stop eating it.

09:52.191 --> 09:53.920
l've had six bowls.

09:53.993 --> 09:55.790
And the reason
it tastes so strange--

09:55.861 --> 09:59.262
l put a container
of nitrogenated soil in it.

09:59.332 --> 10:00.492
Dirt?

10:00.566 --> 10:02.693
You're eating dirt?

10:02.768 --> 10:03.894
Why?

10:03.970 --> 10:05.062
l don't know,

10:05.137 --> 10:06.399
but this morning...

10:07.807 --> 10:09.775
What?

10:09.842 --> 10:13.403
You remember the spawn beetles?

10:13.479 --> 10:15.879
You... you didn't...?

10:19.452 --> 10:21.079
Neelix to Sick Bay.

10:21.153 --> 10:23.087
Prepare to receive
an emergency patient.

10:23.155 --> 10:24.816
l'm not sick.

10:24.890 --> 10:27.085
l feel fine.

10:27.159 --> 10:30.993
l just can't... stop eating.

10:31.063 --> 10:33.156
We are going to get
to the bottom of this.

10:33.232 --> 10:34.164
Come on.

10:34.233 --> 10:35.165
No! l'm not going!

10:35.234 --> 10:36.201
We are going to Sick Bay.

10:36.268 --> 10:37.257
No!

10:37.336 --> 10:38.769
l'll call Security
unless you come with me.

10:38.838 --> 10:40.305
Holy...

10:40.373 --> 10:41.340
Come on.

10:41.407 --> 10:42.339
Stop it!

10:42.408 --> 10:43.397
Put me down!

10:44.610 --> 10:47.170
They're changing course
again, Captain,

10:47.246 --> 10:49.146
and accelerating.

10:49.215 --> 10:50.443
Should l follow them?

10:50.516 --> 10:51.881
l'm concerned
that we're disturbing them.

10:51.951 --> 10:53.942
Let's drop back a bit,
give them a little more room.

10:54.020 --> 10:55.487
Yes, ma'am.

10:57.156 --> 10:59.488
Captain, we're accelerating.

10:59.558 --> 11:01.025
We're getting closer
to the swarm.

11:01.127 --> 11:02.287
Mr. Paris?

11:02.328 --> 11:05.126
l'm trying to slow down,
Captain.

11:05.197 --> 11:08.724
Our velocity doesn't correspond
to impulse reactor output.

11:08.801 --> 11:10.894
We're moving much faster
than we ought to be.

11:10.970 --> 11:13.097
They seem to be...

11:13.172 --> 11:14.469
pulling us toward them.

11:14.540 --> 11:17.202
Sensors indicate
an EM resonance field.

11:17.276 --> 11:18.709
The creatures
seem to be creating

11:18.778 --> 11:19.938
their own magnetic wake.

11:20.012 --> 11:21.411
That is what is pulling
the ship.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.311
We're getting closer.

11:23.382 --> 11:24.815
Mr. Paris, reverse thrusters.

11:25.818 --> 11:27.911
Helm controls aren't responding,
Captain.

11:27.987 --> 11:30.012
Mr. Tuvok, raise shields.

11:31.190 --> 11:32.589
Nonfunctional, Captain.

11:32.658 --> 11:34.023
They're pulling us in.

11:47.707 --> 11:48.901
Damage report.

11:48.974 --> 11:51.306
Life support's functioning
normally, Captain,

11:51.377 --> 11:53.902
but there's a huge fluctuation
in the EPS grids.

11:53.979 --> 11:55.776
lt's wreaking havoc
with the impulse engines.

11:55.848 --> 11:58.408
Warp drive's still on line.

11:58.484 --> 11:59.951
One burst,
and we'd be out of here.

12:00.019 --> 12:02.180
But our exhaust could
seriously harm the creatures.

12:02.288 --> 12:03.550
Janeway to Torres.

12:03.589 --> 12:06.080
Do you have any thoughts about
how to get us out of this swarm

12:06.158 --> 12:07.386
without engaging warp engines?

12:07.460 --> 12:10.657
We might try something like
a targ scoop.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.891
Can you enlighten us,
Lieutenant?

12:12.965 --> 12:15.661
Klingons put them on the front
of ground assault vehicles.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.760
They emit
a high-frequency tone

12:17.837 --> 12:20.101
that disperses targ herds
in their path.

12:20.172 --> 12:21.799
l can modify

12:21.874 --> 12:24.866
the main deflector to create
an inverted magnetic pulse.

12:24.944 --> 12:26.912
Project it toward the swarm.

12:26.979 --> 12:30.938
lt might be enough to... nudge
the creatures out of the way.

12:31.016 --> 12:32.381
Good idea, Lieutenant.

12:32.451 --> 12:33.918
Proceed.

12:33.986 --> 12:36.682
You're sure the beetles
weren't poisonous?

12:36.756 --> 12:38.246
Or the flowers?

12:38.324 --> 12:41.088
There are no toxins
present in her system.

12:41.160 --> 12:44.789
Doctor, why is she eating
all these strange things?

12:44.864 --> 12:45.990
What's wrong with her?

12:46.098 --> 12:49.499
l am conducting an examination
in order to determine that.

12:49.568 --> 12:51.627
But don't you have any ideas?

12:51.704 --> 12:55.834
Her unusual appetite may merely
indicate a nutrient deficiency.

12:55.908 --> 12:57.205
lt is not unusual for humanoids

12:57.276 --> 12:59.369
to crave foods that are rich
in the very vitamins

12:59.445 --> 13:01.572
and minerals
that their bodies are lacking.

13:01.680 --> 13:05.309
You... you can't mean
my body lacks dirt.

13:07.653 --> 13:10.781
Her body temperature
is elevated 3.9 degrees.

13:10.856 --> 13:12.346
She's burning up.

13:12.424 --> 13:13.891
And l'm detecting
elevated levels

13:13.959 --> 13:16.257
of electrophoretic activity
in her nervous system.

13:16.328 --> 13:17.852
You have to bring them down.

13:17.930 --> 13:20.091
There is increased
electrophoretic activity

13:20.166 --> 13:21.690
in the ship's atmosphere,

13:21.767 --> 13:24.031
probably created
by the creatures we're studying.

13:24.103 --> 13:25.434
You mean, there's a connection

13:25.504 --> 13:27.972
between what's happening to Kes
and those creatures?

13:28.040 --> 13:30.668
You have to do
something about it!

13:30.743 --> 13:32.472
You are making it impossible
for me to think,

13:32.545 --> 13:34.410
much less treat my patient.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.412
You must leave.

13:35.481 --> 13:37.210
l won't.
Kes needs me.

13:37.283 --> 13:39.683
Leave now
or l will call Security.

13:39.752 --> 13:42.812
You can't talk to me that way.

13:42.888 --> 13:44.150
This is my Sick Bay

13:44.223 --> 13:45.451
and l will decide
what goes on here.

13:45.524 --> 13:46.650
-But...
-Get out!

13:48.360 --> 13:49.486
l'll be back.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.029
Don't worry about a thing.

14:07.213 --> 14:08.703
Captain, may l speak with you?

14:08.781 --> 14:10.248
lt's a matter of some urgency.

14:10.316 --> 14:11.783
What is it, Neelix?

14:11.851 --> 14:14.752
l have been thrown
out of Sick Bay.

14:17.089 --> 14:20.149
And l'm just wondering
if you feel it's appropriate

14:20.226 --> 14:23.889
for a hologram to banish
a flesh and blood person,

14:23.963 --> 14:25.658
who should have the right
to be at the bedside

14:25.731 --> 14:27.665
of his loved one,
who is extremely ill.

14:27.733 --> 14:29.633
Kes is extremely ill?

14:30.870 --> 14:33.464
The hologram doesn't have a clue
as to what's wrong with her.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.939
Though it may have something
to do with these creatures.

14:36.008 --> 14:38.841
But he still won't let me offer
comfort to the woman l love

14:38.911 --> 14:41.004
at a time when my place
is clearly by her side.

14:44.149 --> 14:46.777
Just how is Kes being
affected by the swarm?

14:46.852 --> 14:50.344
That's what l wanted to know,
but before l got any answers,

14:50.422 --> 14:51.855
l was summarily dismissed.

14:51.924 --> 14:52.982
Sick Bay to Bridge.

14:53.058 --> 14:54.252
Janeway here.

14:54.326 --> 14:55.987
Captain, l think
you'd better come down here.

14:56.061 --> 14:57.790
There's a bit of a problem.

14:57.863 --> 14:58.830
l'm on my way.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.160
Commander, you have the Bridge.

15:00.232 --> 15:01.358
Notify me immediately

15:01.433 --> 15:02.525
of any change in our status.

15:02.601 --> 15:03.693
Aye, Captain.

15:05.404 --> 15:07.338
l was conducting tests.

15:07.406 --> 15:09.340
She was none too cooperative,
let me assure you.

15:09.408 --> 15:10.636
Then suddenly, she screeched

15:10.709 --> 15:12.700
and shoved me out of the way,
went into my office

15:12.778 --> 15:15.508
and proceeded to erect
a-a force field at the door.

15:15.581 --> 15:16.946
l can't lower it.

15:18.484 --> 15:20.349
She's keeping me
out of my own office.

15:20.419 --> 15:21.909
Sweeting.

15:22.955 --> 15:24.422
What's wrong?

15:24.490 --> 15:25.821
Please come out.

15:27.226 --> 15:29.319
l was able to complete
several tests

15:29.395 --> 15:31.329
before she became delirious.

15:31.397 --> 15:32.455
Her fever has increased

15:32.531 --> 15:34.795
and her pulse and blood pressure
are dangerously high.

15:34.867 --> 15:37.665
Do you have any idea
what's causing these symptoms?

15:37.736 --> 15:39.533
l suspect it's
the electrophoretic levels

15:39.605 --> 15:41.334
being created by the swarm.

15:41.407 --> 15:43.637
We should leave immediately.

15:43.709 --> 15:45.904
Unfortunately, that's
not an option at the moment,

15:45.978 --> 15:47.070
but we're working on it.

15:48.347 --> 15:49.405
There's one more thing.

15:49.481 --> 15:52.712
l discovered a strange growth
on her back.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.218
lt's unlike
any other tumorous substance

15:54.286 --> 15:56.254
l've ever seen
or studied before.

15:56.322 --> 15:59.086
And it was not there
the last time l examined her.

16:02.061 --> 16:03.892
l'll try to talk to her.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.692
Kes, please come out.

16:09.768 --> 16:11.736
You can eat anything you want.

16:14.340 --> 16:15.329
Captain.

16:16.442 --> 16:17.909
Why don't you let me try?

16:23.248 --> 16:27.184
Kes, please listen to me.

16:27.252 --> 16:29.846
We think you're being affected

16:29.922 --> 16:32.083
by a swarm
of space-dwelling life-forms.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.489
We're doing everything we can
to get away from them.

16:34.560 --> 16:37.723
And when we do, you'll probably
start feeling better.

16:39.965 --> 16:43.298
Are you... saying that's
not what's wrong with you?

16:48.774 --> 16:52.471
Kes... please, let me come in.

16:52.544 --> 16:54.774
Tell me what it is.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.644
Maybe l can help.

17:17.736 --> 17:19.567
Shh.

17:20.571 --> 17:21.903
Shh.

17:21.973 --> 17:24.464
lt's going to be all right.

17:28.814 --> 17:31.009
Now...

17:31.083 --> 17:34.985
tell me what
is happening to you.

17:36.755 --> 17:38.313
Di-did the Doctor tell you

17:38.390 --> 17:40.483
he found something
growing on my back?

17:40.559 --> 17:43.153
Yes, a growth of some kind.

17:43.228 --> 17:45.788
lt's the mitral sac.

17:45.864 --> 17:48.458
lt's where my child would grow.

17:49.835 --> 17:53.635
l'm going through the elogium--
the time of change--

17:53.705 --> 17:57.766
when my body prepares
for fertilization.

18:01.246 --> 18:05.148
Humans go through
the same kind of process.

18:05.217 --> 18:07.549
lt's called puberty.

18:07.619 --> 18:09.519
But l'm too young.

18:09.588 --> 18:11.283
Much too young.

18:11.356 --> 18:16.293
lt usually happens between
the ages of four and five.

18:16.361 --> 18:19.660
l'm-l'm not even two yet.

18:19.731 --> 18:22.199
Listen to me.

18:22.267 --> 18:26.067
All your body's metabolic
activity has increased.

18:26.138 --> 18:28.333
lt's possible
your reproductive processes

18:28.407 --> 18:30.875
are being accelerated
as a result.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.672
l'm not ready.

18:32.744 --> 18:34.735
We're going to get you
through this, Kes.

18:34.813 --> 18:37.441
The Doctor will monitor
you constantly.

18:37.516 --> 18:39.780
You don't understand.

18:39.852 --> 18:42.514
The elogium occurs only once.

18:42.588 --> 18:43.919
lf l am ever going
to have a child,

18:44.022 --> 18:45.421
it has to be now!

18:51.063 --> 18:52.428
No change, Captain.

18:52.498 --> 18:54.693
We're still being pulled
along with the swarm.

18:56.468 --> 18:58.698
Heading 121, mark 7.

18:58.770 --> 19:01.170
Speed now 6,000
kilometers per second.

19:01.240 --> 19:04.232
All systems are functioning
within normal parameters.

19:04.309 --> 19:05.276
How is Torres coming

19:05.344 --> 19:07.175
with the modifications
to the main deflector?

19:07.246 --> 19:08.440
Her last report estimated

19:08.514 --> 19:10.038
they'd be finished
in another half hour.

19:10.115 --> 19:11.946
Let me know
as soon as she's ready.

19:12.017 --> 19:13.609
Join me, Commander?

19:18.157 --> 19:19.852
Kes is terribly frightened.

19:19.925 --> 19:22.120
She's had no time
to prepare for this,

19:22.194 --> 19:26.631
and the decision has to be made
in the next 40 or 50 hours.

19:26.698 --> 19:29.792
She's going to discuss
it with Neelix, but...

19:32.004 --> 19:34.905
there are so many unknowns.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.976
There might be risks
in procreating this early.

19:38.043 --> 19:39.704
And of course
there's no guarantee

19:39.778 --> 19:41.268
they're genetically compatible,

19:41.346 --> 19:45.180
or that Neelix has any interest
in becoming a father.

19:46.351 --> 19:47.909
Seems your concerns

19:48.020 --> 19:51.353
about fraternization
were... prophetic.

19:51.423 --> 19:55.655
l wasn't even thinking
about procreation,

19:55.727 --> 20:00.494
but l suppose it's...
the inevitable outcome.

20:02.801 --> 20:05.361
We should consider the fact
that it might be necessary

20:05.437 --> 20:07.029
for the crew to start
having children.

20:07.105 --> 20:10.404
lt might take us
a long time to get home.

20:10.475 --> 20:13.876
lf it does take 7 5 years,
we're going to need

20:13.946 --> 20:16.437
a replacement crew
in about half that time.

20:18.217 --> 20:21.618
Who'd have thought we'd be
considering a generational ship

20:21.687 --> 20:24.485
when we were ordered
on a three-week mission.

20:24.556 --> 20:27.957
l know, but it's a problem
we have to face now.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.587
What would that mean
for the children?

20:34.032 --> 20:36.830
What kind of life
would we be giving them?

20:36.902 --> 20:38.392
Aboard a starship,

20:38.470 --> 20:41.997
traveling through a potentially
hostile part of space.

20:42.107 --> 20:45.941
And are we equipped to provide
for their needs--

20:46.011 --> 20:48.206
child-care,
educational facilities.

20:48.280 --> 20:51.545
We'd be building an entire
community on board this ship.

20:51.617 --> 20:54.177
That's a massive commitment.

20:54.253 --> 20:57.017
Are you prepared to tell them
they can't have children?

20:57.089 --> 20:59.057
l can't do that.

21:02.227 --> 21:04.627
And l've made it clear
to Kes that it's her choice

21:04.696 --> 21:06.926
whether to have a child
or not, but...

21:07.032 --> 21:08.192
Mmm.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.792
There aren't
any easy answers here...

21:10.869 --> 21:13.838
for any of us.

21:17.209 --> 21:21.270
Are you saying that,
unless you conceive now,

21:21.346 --> 21:22.973
you'll never be able to?

21:23.081 --> 21:26.448
Yes, and l need you
to help me decide,

21:26.518 --> 21:28.611
because l would want
you to mate with me.

21:32.958 --> 21:37.554
l'm... l'm... l'm...
l'm... l'm... l'm...

21:37.629 --> 21:38.994
honored.

21:39.064 --> 21:42.659
But are you entirely
certain it would be safe?

21:42.734 --> 21:43.792
Safe?

21:45.504 --> 21:47.972
You're so young.

21:48.040 --> 21:52.841
ls it dangerous for you
to conceive a child at your age?

21:52.911 --> 21:54.003
l don't know.

21:54.079 --> 21:57.139
l've never known anyone
as young as l am who had a baby.

22:02.254 --> 22:06.247
lf you never had a child,
would you...

22:06.325 --> 22:07.417
be terribly unhappy?

22:07.492 --> 22:08.891
Yes!

22:08.960 --> 22:10.757
l-l mean...

22:10.829 --> 22:12.194
l think so.

22:14.099 --> 22:15.828
l don't know.

22:17.969 --> 22:20.938
l always assumed
l'd be a mother someday--

22:21.039 --> 22:24.475
just not so soon.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.145
What about you?

22:27.212 --> 22:29.510
Didn't you think
you'd be a father someday?

22:29.581 --> 22:33.779
Well, to be honest, uh...

22:33.852 --> 22:36.412
l've never given it
much thought.

22:36.488 --> 22:42.256
Until now, my life
has been so... itinerant.

22:42.327 --> 22:45.160
There's no way
l could have provided

22:45.230 --> 22:47.528
the stability
a child would need.

22:47.599 --> 22:49.829
But now it's different,
isn't it?

22:51.069 --> 22:52.434
Well...

22:52.504 --> 22:54.404
yes.

22:54.473 --> 22:56.771
But...

22:56.842 --> 23:00.073
raising a child on a starship--

23:00.145 --> 23:03.444
that's hardly what l would
call the ideal environment.

23:03.515 --> 23:06.382
You don't want a child, do you?

23:06.451 --> 23:08.578
That's not it at all.

23:08.653 --> 23:12.783
l'm just trying to look
at all sides of the issue.

23:14.359 --> 23:17.294
Bringing a child
into the world...

23:17.362 --> 23:19.796
it's a huge responsibility.

23:19.865 --> 23:23.801
l know you'd want to be sure
we're both up to the task.

23:24.970 --> 23:27.370
l-l mean, somebody
would have to keep their eye

23:27.439 --> 23:29.100
on the little guy all the time,

23:29.174 --> 23:32.075
or he'd be off sticking
his finger into an EM conduit

23:32.144 --> 23:35.978
or playing
with the plasma injectors.

23:36.047 --> 23:38.174
That's right--
that's called being a parent.

23:41.353 --> 23:43.412
What about your medical studies?

23:43.488 --> 23:45.217
You wouldn't be able
to continue them

23:45.290 --> 23:46.222
if you had a child.

23:46.291 --> 23:47.280
Of course l would!

23:47.359 --> 23:49.327
You're just making excuses.

23:49.394 --> 23:51.225
All you're thinking about
is yourself--

23:51.296 --> 23:53.560
how much trouble a child
would be for you.

23:53.632 --> 23:56.123
Look!

23:56.201 --> 23:57.498
What's that?

23:57.569 --> 23:59.730
The ipasaphor.

23:59.805 --> 24:01.864
lt makes the mating bond
possible.

24:01.973 --> 24:03.406
lt does?

24:03.475 --> 24:07.434
lf we begin, we must stay bonded
for six days.

24:07.512 --> 24:09.639
Six days?

24:09.714 --> 24:11.909
ln order to ensure conception.

24:11.983 --> 24:13.712
And after the ipasaphor appears,

24:13.785 --> 24:17.915
we only have 50 hours
to begin the process.

24:18.023 --> 24:20.924
So l need to know your answer.

24:21.026 --> 24:23.927
Uh, well, uh...

24:24.029 --> 24:25.326
50 hours.

24:25.397 --> 24:28.764
That's... good.

24:31.603 --> 24:32.900
That's good.

24:35.807 --> 24:37.502
We can sleep on it.

24:39.444 --> 24:41.036
l'll get back to you.

24:59.064 --> 25:00.088
Sorry.

25:00.198 --> 25:02.564
l swear l heard you say
lots of pepper sauce.

25:06.304 --> 25:08.067
What is the lunch special today?

25:09.808 --> 25:11.298
Well, actually, l didn't

25:11.376 --> 25:13.742
get around to making
a lunch special.

25:13.812 --> 25:16.679
But we have some lovely
gabosti stew left over

25:16.748 --> 25:17.908
from last night.

25:17.983 --> 25:20.884
Very well, it will do.

25:20.952 --> 25:24.649
l've... had quite a run on it
as a matter of fact.

25:24.723 --> 25:27.487
lt seems very popular.

25:27.559 --> 25:30.926
lf it is all you are serving,
that would stand to reason.

25:30.996 --> 25:33.863
You can have it
with or without pepper sauce.

25:33.932 --> 25:35.024
Without.

25:53.151 --> 25:54.778
Oh...

26:02.093 --> 26:04.789
Mr. Tuvok...

26:04.863 --> 26:06.797
l was wondering.

26:06.865 --> 26:09.857
You have children, don't you?

26:09.935 --> 26:11.402
l have four.

26:11.469 --> 26:13.994
Four! My!

26:14.072 --> 26:16.597
That's certainly quite a family.

26:16.675 --> 26:19.872
Tell me...

26:19.945 --> 26:23.904
what's it like being a father?

26:24.015 --> 26:27.917
The question is so broad,
it is difficult to respond.

26:28.019 --> 26:31.546
Well, l mean, it's a lot
of responsibility, isn't it?

26:31.623 --> 26:33.784
Watching them.

26:33.858 --> 26:34.916
Caring for them.

26:35.026 --> 26:36.516
Keeping them safe.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.688
Giving them an education.

26:38.763 --> 26:41.323
That is certainly true.

26:41.399 --> 26:45.096
Sounds like it's a lot more
trouble than it's worth.

26:45.170 --> 26:48.936
Mr. Neelix,
l am aware of your situation.

26:49.040 --> 26:50.735
lt appears you are in some doubt

26:50.809 --> 26:53.073
as to the wisdom
of becoming a parent.

26:53.144 --> 26:57.171
lt's just all happening so fast!

26:57.248 --> 26:59.079
l don't know what to think.

26:59.150 --> 27:00.344
l can only tell you

27:00.452 --> 27:02.886
that if you have considerable
doubts about fatherhood,

27:02.921 --> 27:05.549
it would not be wise
to enter into the process.

27:05.624 --> 27:08.991
lt is so much more overwhelming
than one expects

27:09.060 --> 27:11.494
that l believe only
the most committed

27:11.563 --> 27:13.224
should become parents.

27:13.298 --> 27:15.198
Ah...

27:15.266 --> 27:17.166
That's what l thought.

27:17.235 --> 27:21.604
However, l must point out
that, as illogical as it seems,

27:21.673 --> 27:24.665
being a father can have
infinite rewards--

27:24.743 --> 27:27.075
far more
than would seem possible.

27:27.145 --> 27:30.842
My children occupy a significant
portion of my thoughts,

27:30.915 --> 27:34.783
now more than ever.

27:34.853 --> 27:36.013
l have heard it said

27:36.087 --> 27:40.387
that children can bring a lot
of joy into one's life.

27:40.458 --> 27:43.621
l experience
neither joy nor sorrow,

27:43.695 --> 27:45.959
but l do believe it is possible.

27:48.033 --> 27:50.058
Now that l think about it,

27:50.135 --> 27:53.127
it might be fun
to have a little guy around.

27:53.204 --> 27:56.833
And we could do a lot together.

27:56.908 --> 28:00.776
l've got quite a bit
l could teach a boy, you know--

28:00.845 --> 28:04.440
survival methods,

28:04.516 --> 28:06.848
piloting skills,

28:06.951 --> 28:09.044
romantic techniques.

28:11.056 --> 28:12.387
lf you say so.

28:12.457 --> 28:14.857
But l must point out
that there is an equal chance

28:14.959 --> 28:16.722
that you would have a daughter.

28:16.795 --> 28:18.786
A daughter?

28:18.863 --> 28:21.661
l don't have anything
to teach a daughter.

28:21.733 --> 28:25.066
Why would it be any different
from what you would teach a son?

28:26.104 --> 28:28.004
lt just would.

28:28.073 --> 28:30.564
She'd learn more
from her mother.

28:30.642 --> 28:33.873
l have three sons
and one daughter.

28:33.945 --> 28:35.674
l can assure you, she benefits

28:35.747 --> 28:37.908
as much from my presence
and guidance

28:38.016 --> 28:39.381
as my sons do.

28:39.451 --> 28:41.749
lt is unfortunate

28:41.820 --> 28:44.653
that l must be so far removed
from all of them now.

28:47.592 --> 28:49.651
l understand.

28:49.728 --> 28:52.356
We'll get there, Mr. Vulcan.

28:52.430 --> 28:54.227
l'm sure of it.

28:56.634 --> 28:58.534
Thank you.

28:58.603 --> 29:00.867
You've given me a lot
to think about.

29:07.946 --> 29:09.038
We're ready to generate

29:09.114 --> 29:10.342
the inverted
magnetic pulse, Captain.

29:10.415 --> 29:11.939
Proceed.

29:13.785 --> 29:15.514
lnitiating the field.

29:19.090 --> 29:20.717
lt's working.

29:20.792 --> 29:22.692
Are the creatures all right,
Commander?

29:22.761 --> 29:24.854
Yes, Captain,
they seem to be fine.

29:24.929 --> 29:26.692
Let's try to keep it that way.

29:26.765 --> 29:28.198
Thrusters at 200 kph,
Mr. Paris.

29:28.266 --> 29:29.255
Ease us out of here.

29:29.334 --> 29:30.460
Aye, Captain.

29:36.207 --> 29:37.174
What are they doing?

29:37.242 --> 29:39.506
Hard to know
what's prompting that behavior.

29:39.577 --> 29:41.272
Maybe they think
we're making a hostile move.

29:42.347 --> 29:43.507
Report.

29:43.581 --> 29:46.209
l'm reading a massive energy
drain in all ship systems.

29:46.284 --> 29:47.751
lmpulse engines
are losing power.

29:47.819 --> 29:49.810
Captain,
some of the life-forms

29:49.888 --> 29:51.412
have attached themselves
to the warp nacelles.

29:51.489 --> 29:54.253
Guidance, navigational and
tactical systems are failing.

29:54.325 --> 29:56.054
How soon will we clear
the swarm, Lieutenant?

29:56.127 --> 29:57.856
ln a few seconds.
We're almost out.

29:57.929 --> 30:01.558
Captain, l am detecting
a substantial magnetic mass

30:01.633 --> 30:03.624
moving rapidly
toward the port bow.

30:16.581 --> 30:19.311
lt's physiologically similar
to the smaller creatures,

30:19.384 --> 30:20.715
just a lot bigger.

30:20.785 --> 30:22.878
Perhaps it is the parent.

30:22.954 --> 30:24.615
Or it could be
a difference in gender.

30:24.689 --> 30:27.886
lt's hard to say
without further observation.

30:27.959 --> 30:28.983
With all due respect, Captain,

30:29.060 --> 30:30.721
haven't we done
enough observing?

30:30.795 --> 30:33.821
These creatures have attacked
the ship's key systems.

30:33.898 --> 30:36.389
For all we know, they were
setting us up for an attack.

30:36.467 --> 30:37.434
lt's possible.

30:37.502 --> 30:39.197
Mr. Paris, let's keep moving.

30:39.270 --> 30:41.363
lf we can put some distance
between us and the swarm,

30:41.439 --> 30:42.497
maybe the ones on our nacelles

30:42.574 --> 30:44.906
will drop off
and rejoin their friends.

30:44.976 --> 30:47.740
Aye, Captain.
200 kph.

30:53.785 --> 30:56.015
The larger creature
is moving with us.

30:57.989 --> 30:58.956
Now what?

30:59.023 --> 31:00.081
The creature has emitted

31:00.191 --> 31:03.058
an electrically charged
plasma stream.

31:03.094 --> 31:05.028
All stop.
Damage report.

31:06.264 --> 31:07.754
No significant damage, Captain.

31:07.832 --> 31:08.764
Shields are holding.

31:08.833 --> 31:11.097
A plasma blast
is a hostile move.

31:11.169 --> 31:13.137
Shouldn't we be thinking
about responding?

31:14.372 --> 31:16.806
lf the creature threatens
serious damage to the ship,

31:16.875 --> 31:18.433
l'll consider it an enemy.

31:18.509 --> 31:19.976
Until then,
they're all to be treated

31:20.044 --> 31:21.978
as indigenous life-forms
behaving normally

31:22.046 --> 31:23.240
in their natural habitat.

31:23.314 --> 31:25.111
We're the intruders here.

31:25.183 --> 31:27.310
Captain, look at this.

31:30.021 --> 31:31.249
They're attaching themselves

31:31.322 --> 31:33.813
to the large creature
the same way they did to us.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.587
And l think l know why.

31:35.660 --> 31:36.991
That plasma stream it ejected

31:37.061 --> 31:39.962
has almost the same subspace
signature as our warp nacelles.

31:41.199 --> 31:42.564
Then the smaller creatures
are attracted

31:42.634 --> 31:43.999
to our subspace emissions.

31:44.068 --> 31:45.330
Perhaps in the same way

31:45.403 --> 31:47.598
some species are attracted
to pheromones.

31:47.672 --> 31:49.105
Pheromones?

31:50.475 --> 31:52.875
You think
it's a sexual attraction?

31:52.944 --> 31:55.378
Color change
and provocative movement

31:55.446 --> 31:58.472
are frequently associated
with mating rituals.

31:58.549 --> 32:01.916
Then... these guys think
we're one of them?

32:02.020 --> 32:02.952
Well, their behavior toward us

32:03.021 --> 32:04.545
and the large creature
is similar.

32:04.622 --> 32:08.114
lt's possible they've mistaken
us for a potential mate.

32:12.730 --> 32:13.697
Yes?

32:13.765 --> 32:16.290
Well, order the diapers.

32:16.367 --> 32:18.028
We're about to become parents.

32:18.102 --> 32:21.196
You mean,
you want to mate with me?

32:21.272 --> 32:23.206
More than anything.

32:23.274 --> 32:24.571
But you were making excuses.

32:24.642 --> 32:26.542
l didn't think
you wanted to be a father.

32:26.611 --> 32:28.977
l just hadn't
thought it through.

32:29.047 --> 32:32.346
Now that l have, l swear to you
l want to do this.

32:32.417 --> 32:36.080
And l'll be the best
possible father to our child.

32:40.124 --> 32:42.058
l know you will.

32:42.226 --> 32:43.921
So...

32:43.995 --> 32:46.987
what comes next?

32:47.065 --> 32:49.090
Before we begin
the mating process,

32:49.167 --> 32:50.828
l have to go through
a certain ritual

32:50.902 --> 32:52.426
called the rolisisin.

32:52.503 --> 32:55.199
What does that involve?

32:55.273 --> 32:57.969
One of my parents
has to massage my feet

32:58.042 --> 33:00.010
until my tongue begins to swell.

33:03.748 --> 33:06.683
Uh, where do you plan
to find a parent?

33:06.751 --> 33:08.582
lf Captain Janeway weren't
so busy l'd ask her,

33:08.653 --> 33:10.086
but l'm sure
the Doctor would do it.

33:10.154 --> 33:11.485
Will that work?

33:11.556 --> 33:14.218
Since he's not a real person?

33:14.292 --> 33:16.419
The Doctor is very real to me.

33:16.494 --> 33:20.453
l don't know how l feel
about him massaging your feet.

33:20.531 --> 33:22.396
lt's a ritual.
Someone has to do it.

33:22.467 --> 33:25.095
Okay. Okay, fine.

33:25.169 --> 33:27.603
How long will that take?

33:28.639 --> 33:29.936
About an hour.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.102
Then l'll be back.

33:51.763 --> 33:54.323
Fascinating.

33:54.399 --> 33:55.866
The stimulation
to the sympathetic nerves

33:55.933 --> 33:57.833
must set off
a hormonal reaction,

33:57.902 --> 33:59.563
which activates
glandular activity

33:59.637 --> 34:01.195
in the tissues of the tongue.

34:01.305 --> 34:03.239
l've never seen
this response before.

34:03.274 --> 34:05.265
Although in a species
known as the Gree,

34:05.343 --> 34:07.368
stimulating follicles
on the proboscis

34:07.445 --> 34:09.504
results in a swelling
of the auricular canal.

34:09.580 --> 34:10.569
Doctor?

34:10.648 --> 34:12.172
Yes?

34:12.250 --> 34:14.844
Am l doing the right thing?

34:14.918 --> 34:16.853
You'll have to tell me.

34:16.920 --> 34:19.481
l know nothing of this ritual.

34:19.556 --> 34:21.081
No, l mean, am l doing
the right thing

34:21.159 --> 34:22.387
by conceiving a child?

34:24.529 --> 34:25.791
lf l were at home now,

34:25.862 --> 34:29.799
my father would be performing
the rolisisin with me.

34:32.469 --> 34:34.199
lt's the time
when parent and child

34:34.272 --> 34:36.172
move into a new kind
of relationship.

34:36.239 --> 34:38.538
As the child has her own child,

34:38.609 --> 34:42.511
the parent must acknowledge
her true adulthood.

34:42.580 --> 34:44.706
l see.

34:44.782 --> 34:47.842
My father and l were very close.

34:47.918 --> 34:49.545
He was such a wise man.

34:49.620 --> 34:51.087
l miss him.

34:51.155 --> 34:54.147
Sometimes, l think l hear
his voice in my head.

34:54.225 --> 34:55.987
lt's almost
as though he were here

34:56.094 --> 34:57.186
helping to guide me.

35:00.164 --> 35:01.859
l'm sorry.

35:01.933 --> 35:06.529
l must be feeling lonely
for home.

35:06.604 --> 35:10.597
lt's probably a result
of the elogium...

35:13.211 --> 35:17.443
but l really would appreciate
your advice.

35:17.515 --> 35:19.483
Your help.

35:21.986 --> 35:24.250
l need someone's guidance.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.616
l can discuss
delivery methods...

35:29.694 --> 35:33.494
or pediatric situations.

35:33.564 --> 35:36.431
l'm afraid l don't have
much perspective to offer

35:36.501 --> 35:38.594
about becoming a parent.

35:40.171 --> 35:42.696
Neither do l.

35:42.773 --> 35:46.903
As long as Neelix
was opposed to the idea,

35:46.978 --> 35:48.240
trying to get out of it,

35:48.312 --> 35:50.644
l was certain that l wanted
to have a child,

35:50.715 --> 35:52.842
but when he said
that he wanted one, too,

35:52.917 --> 35:54.942
suddenly, l was very frightened.

35:59.590 --> 36:03.993
Perhaps a statistical survey
will offer a context.

36:04.095 --> 36:07.223
Among the Breen,
pregnancy at a young age

36:07.265 --> 36:08.755
is a common event.

36:08.833 --> 36:09.993
The Breen, of course,

36:10.067 --> 36:12.297
is one of the most warlike
of species.

36:12.370 --> 36:14.167
And then there are the Scathos.

36:14.238 --> 36:16.001
Any woman who conceives a child

36:16.073 --> 36:19.099
before her fourth decade
is summarily executed.

36:19.177 --> 36:21.008
Maybe l just felt
l should have a child

36:21.078 --> 36:22.045
because l could.

36:22.113 --> 36:25.549
There is a powerful
biological drive,

36:25.616 --> 36:28.744
at times, almost impossible
to resist.

36:28.819 --> 36:32.414
Species are driven by these
urges in order to survive.

36:32.490 --> 36:34.390
But isn't that
why we have minds--

36:34.458 --> 36:40.363
to look beyond biological urges,
to consider their consequences?

36:40.431 --> 36:43.400
lf l'm going to ask myself
to look at those consequences,

36:43.467 --> 36:45.901
then l have to ask myself
some questions.

36:45.970 --> 36:49.497
Am l really ready
to have a child?

36:51.876 --> 36:53.343
Am l prepared to give that child

36:53.411 --> 36:56.744
the attention and devotion
it deserves?

36:56.814 --> 37:01.114
Am l capable of taking on
such a huge responsibility?

37:01.185 --> 37:03.176
Oh, there's so much
l haven't done.

37:03.254 --> 37:05.848
There's so much
l want to study and learn.

37:05.957 --> 37:08.517
l'm not sure
l'm finished growing.

37:08.593 --> 37:10.618
How could l help a child grow?

37:18.169 --> 37:19.329
lf the smaller creatures

37:19.403 --> 37:21.598
are sexually attracted
to our subspace emissions,

37:21.672 --> 37:23.970
then the large one
may perceive us as a rival.

37:24.041 --> 37:25.668
That plasma burst it sent out

37:25.743 --> 37:27.643
might have been
aggressive posturing.

37:27.712 --> 37:30.340
Then you'd think it would be
happy to see us leave.

37:30.414 --> 37:32.041
Lieutenant, is there
any way we could generate

37:32.116 --> 37:33.048
a short burst of impulse?

37:33.117 --> 37:34.516
Enough to get us away
from this swarm?

37:34.585 --> 37:35.609
l could try

37:35.686 --> 37:37.677
releasing power from the
impulse capacitance cells

37:37.755 --> 37:39.313
straight into the driver coils.

37:39.390 --> 37:40.379
Do it.

37:40.458 --> 37:42.153
All right.

37:42.226 --> 37:45.218
l've accessed
the capacitance cells.

37:45.296 --> 37:48.629
l think l can give you enough
for a short burst of impulse.

37:48.699 --> 37:49.927
We've got one shot, Captain.

37:50.034 --> 37:51.331
You heard her, Mr. Paris.

37:51.402 --> 37:52.630
Make the best of it.

37:52.703 --> 37:53.795
Aye, Captain.

37:53.871 --> 37:55.839
lnitiating impulse burst...

37:55.906 --> 37:57.567
now.

37:58.676 --> 38:00.405
Captain,
the creature is reacting.

38:00.511 --> 38:03.207
lt is approaching rapidly
on a collision course.

38:03.247 --> 38:04.839
Evasive maneuvers, Lieutenant.

38:04.915 --> 38:06.212
We don't have the power
for that.

38:06.284 --> 38:08.252
The creature is accelerating.

38:08.319 --> 38:10.014
l'm losing power.
Can't shake him.

38:10.087 --> 38:11.611
All hands brace for impact.

38:28.139 --> 38:30.573
Structural integrity
down to 86 percent.

38:30.641 --> 38:31.573
l am beginning to share

38:31.642 --> 38:33.109
Lieutenant Torres' views,
Captain.

38:33.177 --> 38:34.838
Retaliation
may become necessary.

38:34.912 --> 38:38.075
lt's not my intention
to harm the creature.

38:38.149 --> 38:41.243
The feeling
definitely isn't mutual.

38:41.319 --> 38:42.752
Mr. Tuvok,
launch a class- 4 probe.

38:42.820 --> 38:44.481
Maybe that will distract
the creature long enough

38:44.555 --> 38:45.487
for us to get away.

38:45.556 --> 38:46.784
Aye, Captain.

38:46.857 --> 38:48.324
Probe launched.

38:49.794 --> 38:51.421
Another plasma burst.

38:51.495 --> 38:52.860
Shields are down to 64 percent.

38:52.930 --> 38:54.921
Looks like the probe
just made him angry.

38:54.999 --> 38:56.830
This is an aggressive life-form,
Captain.

38:56.901 --> 38:59.563
He's only going to respond
to an aggressive stance from us.

38:59.637 --> 39:01.571
Treating the creature
as it is treating us

39:01.672 --> 39:03.503
might be
an appropriate response.

39:03.541 --> 39:05.008
We ram him.

39:05.076 --> 39:06.338
Precisely.

39:06.410 --> 39:08.344
lt's probably
the response he expects.

39:09.880 --> 39:12.144
Captain,
shields are at 47 percent.

39:12.216 --> 39:14.582
Any more of this and the hull
will start to buckle.

39:14.652 --> 39:16.813
Mr. Paris, use
maneuvering thrusters.

39:16.887 --> 39:18.218
Set a course
toward the creature.

39:18.289 --> 39:20.086
Give him a bump
to get his attention.

39:20.157 --> 39:22.250
Aye, Captain.
Engaging thrusters.

39:28.299 --> 39:30.324
The creature is not retreating,
Captain.

39:32.002 --> 39:34.527
He's just hitting us
back harder.

39:34.605 --> 39:35.867
Let's try this.

39:36.006 --> 39:37.496
Detonate a field
of photon charges

39:37.575 --> 39:39.304
between Voyager
and the creature.

39:39.377 --> 39:40.344
Maybe the shock wave

39:40.411 --> 39:41.776
will let him know
we mean business.

39:41.846 --> 39:43.006
Captain, if l may.

39:43.080 --> 39:45.139
Maybe we're going
about this backwards.

39:45.216 --> 39:46.547
Yes, Commander?

39:46.617 --> 39:48.209
Every aggressive move we make

39:48.285 --> 39:51.015
results in a more aggressive
move by the creature.

39:51.088 --> 39:52.885
lf we're not prepared
to use extreme force

39:52.957 --> 39:55.255
to destroy him, we need
to rethink our actions.

39:55.326 --> 39:56.258
l'm listening.

39:56.327 --> 39:57.851
lf we're right that the creature

39:57.928 --> 39:59.725
is responding to us
as a sexual rival,

39:59.797 --> 40:01.924
we might try behaving
in a submissive way.

40:02.032 --> 40:03.465
That may appease him.

40:03.534 --> 40:04.933
We'd be acknowledging
that he's dominant

40:05.002 --> 40:06.367
and that we're no match for him.

40:06.437 --> 40:07.369
How do we do that?

40:07.438 --> 40:08.666
We tried to move away slowly.

40:08.739 --> 40:09.865
He wouldn't let us leave.

40:09.940 --> 40:11.635
Maybe we need to mimic
the behavior

40:11.709 --> 40:12.937
of the smaller creatures.

40:13.043 --> 40:15.443
We saw them rolling over
and changing color.

40:15.513 --> 40:18.141
lf we vent plasma residue,

40:18.215 --> 40:19.842
that might make us look blue.

40:19.917 --> 40:22.147
Mr. Paris,
do we have enough power

40:22.219 --> 40:24.187
to take Voyager into a roll?

40:24.255 --> 40:25.722
l think so.

40:25.790 --> 40:28.691
All right.
Let's give this a try.

40:28.759 --> 40:31.159
Mr. Kim, start venting
plasma residue.

40:31.228 --> 40:34.425
Mr. Paris, roll the ship.

40:35.766 --> 40:37.893
Full power to inertial dampers.

40:50.014 --> 40:51.879
He's not responding at all.

40:51.949 --> 40:52.938
lt's not working.

40:53.017 --> 40:54.041
Wait a minute, Captain.

40:54.118 --> 40:55.244
What is it?

40:55.319 --> 40:56.684
One of the small creatures

40:56.754 --> 40:59.018
is detaching
from the starboard nacelle.

40:59.089 --> 41:00.818
And another one.

41:00.925 --> 41:02.722
They're all letting go.

41:04.862 --> 41:07.524
lt appears we have lost
our sex appeal, Captain.

41:09.166 --> 41:10.758
Good piloting, Lieutenant.

41:10.835 --> 41:13.895
Now, let's see if we can move
away without any interference.

41:13.971 --> 41:15.802
l can give you
enough thruster power

41:15.873 --> 41:18.341
to sustain a speed
of 100 kph.

41:18.409 --> 41:19.933
Acknowledged.

41:20.010 --> 41:22.570
Good work, Commander.

41:22.646 --> 41:23.635
ln the future,

41:23.714 --> 41:25.477
if l have any questions
about mating behavior,

41:25.549 --> 41:27.176
l'll know where to go.

41:57.982 --> 41:59.472
Can l help?

41:59.550 --> 42:01.575
No.

42:01.685 --> 42:03.312
Thanks.

42:04.822 --> 42:06.756
ls something wrong?

42:06.824 --> 42:09.088
No, no, nothing.

42:10.127 --> 42:11.560
You've been very quiet

42:11.629 --> 42:13.927
ever since l decided
not to conceive.

42:14.031 --> 42:17.159
lt was your choice.

42:17.234 --> 42:19.293
l respect that.

42:19.370 --> 42:22.066
Neelix...

42:22.139 --> 42:24.107
l think you're disappointed.

42:27.711 --> 42:30.373
l think...

42:30.447 --> 42:33.848
once l decided
to become a father,

42:33.918 --> 42:37.786
l was looking forward to it.

42:37.855 --> 42:39.789
But l'll get over it.

42:39.857 --> 42:42.587
Maybe you won't have
to get over it.

42:42.660 --> 42:44.685
Just wait a little longer.

42:44.762 --> 42:46.753
But l thought...

42:46.830 --> 42:48.627
this was the only time.

42:48.699 --> 42:50.667
The Doctor believes
the elogium was false,

42:50.734 --> 42:54.431
brought on by
the electrophoretic field

42:54.505 --> 42:57.838
that those life-forms created.

42:57.908 --> 42:59.967
So there's a possibility
that l might be able

43:00.044 --> 43:02.478
to go through it again
at the right age.

43:02.513 --> 43:05.778
You mean, we might still
be able to have a daughter?

43:05.816 --> 43:06.748
Or a son.

43:06.817 --> 43:07.715
No.

43:07.785 --> 43:08.752
l've thought about it.

43:08.819 --> 43:11.014
A daughter, definitely--

43:11.088 --> 43:13.852
one who looks just like you.

43:24.969 --> 43:29.099
Captain's Log, Stardate 48921.3.

43:29.173 --> 43:30.231
l continue to wonder

43:30.307 --> 43:32.639
about the issue of procreation
aboard the ship.

43:32.710 --> 43:34.337
Certainly, it's wrong
to interfere

43:34.411 --> 43:36.936
with the private lives
and decisions of the crew.

43:37.014 --> 43:39.107
Yet l remain concerned
about the environment

43:39.183 --> 43:41.743
we could provide
for any child born here.

43:47.791 --> 43:48.780
Come in.

43:50.094 --> 43:50.992
Yes, Ensign.

43:51.095 --> 43:52.562
What can l do for you?

43:52.630 --> 43:54.621
l'm sorry
to disturb you, Captain,

43:54.698 --> 43:56.461
but l thought...

43:56.533 --> 44:01.732
l thought l should inform you
of my physical condition.

44:02.840 --> 44:04.637
Your physical condition?

44:06.243 --> 44:08.677
Well, we'd been trying
for months.

44:08.746 --> 44:12.045
l wasn't even sure
until a few days ago.

44:12.116 --> 44:14.846
My husband is still
at Deep Space 9.

44:14.918 --> 44:16.408
He doesn't even know.

44:16.487 --> 44:19.012
We were only supposed to be out
two or three weeks.

44:19.089 --> 44:21.284
Wildman...

44:21.358 --> 44:23.087
are you pregnant?

44:28.999 --> 44:31.661
l know this isn't the best place
to have a baby, but...

44:33.203 --> 44:35.831
it's all l have left...

44:35.906 --> 44:37.703
of my husband.

44:40.077 --> 44:41.977
Well...

44:42.079 --> 44:44.809
congratulations, Ensign.
