02:01.567 --> 02:03.633
I'M NEVER GONNA GET
A GIRLFRIEND.

02:03.633 --> 02:06.167
- AND DO YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?

02:06.167 --> 02:07.533
- NO!

02:07.533 --> 02:09.467
- THEN TAKE HER TO SEE THE MOVIE
KISS AND TELL,

02:09.467 --> 02:10.800
WHICH OPENS TONIGHT.

02:10.800 --> 02:14.667
IT'S THE STORY OF A LAWYER
TOO BUSY FOR LOVE

02:14.667 --> 02:18.567
AND A DOWN-AND-OUT CHEF
WITH A RECIPE FOR ROMANCE.

02:18.567 --> 02:21.167
IT'S A FILM SO ROMANTIC

02:21.167 --> 02:23.233
THAT IF YOU'RE NOT SMOOCHING
IN THE AISLES,

02:23.233 --> 02:24.300
YOU'RE DEAD...

02:24.300 --> 02:26.233
OR ALONE.

- BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING WRONG.

02:35.233 --> 02:37.267
I'M LOVABLE.

02:37.267 --> 02:39.267
- WHICH IS WHY
YOU HAVE TO KEEP LOOKING.

02:39.267 --> 02:42.067
A GIRLFRIEND'S NOT JUST GONNA
WALK IN THE DOOR AND SAY,

02:42.067 --> 02:43.700
"HEY, LET'S GO ON A DATE
TONIGHT."

02:43.700 --> 02:46.567
- HEY!
LET'S GO ON A DATE TONIGHT.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.067
- OKAY, BAD EXAMPLE.

02:48.067 --> 02:49.667
- [screams]

02:49.667 --> 02:51.533
- I PRINTED OUT TWO TICKETS
FOR KISS AND TELL.

02:51.533 --> 02:54.067
POP TIGER GAVE IT FIVE SMOOCHES
ON THEIR MAKE OUT METER.

02:54.067 --> 02:55.967

03:01.967 --> 03:03.533
I'VE NEVER DOUBLE-DATED BEFORE.

03:03.533 --> 03:05.600
- GREAT.
WHO'S HIS DATE?

03:05.600 --> 03:07.333
- WE HAVE TO FIND HIM ONE.

03:07.333 --> 03:09.800
- OF COURSE WE CAN FIND CARLOS
A DATE.

03:12.433 --> 03:14.067
- I'M READY.

03:14.067 --> 03:16.067
- YEAH, LET'S LEAVE
THE HELMET HERE.

03:16.067 --> 03:17.133
- CAN'T DO THAT.

03:17.133 --> 03:18.400
- IT'S FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.
- IT IS.

03:18.400 --> 03:19.567

03:29.367 --> 03:32.300
- HEY, I'M OFF TO AN AUDITION,
BUT WHAT ARE YOU DOING LATER?

03:32.300 --> 03:34.967
- UM, JUST, YOU KNOW,

03:34.967 --> 03:36.133
RUBBIN' MY BUNIONS.

03:36.133 --> 03:37.933

03:37.933 --> 03:39.733
WELL, UH, MAYBE WE'LL MEET UP.

03:39.733 --> 03:41.300
- ALL RIGHT, MAYBE.

03:47.667 --> 03:50.067
- I AM SO SORRY.
I LOST MY GLASSES.

03:50.067 --> 03:51.967
ARE YOU OKAY, MA'AM?

03:51.967 --> 03:54.500

03:59.733 --> 04:01.600
- OH, WELL, YOU SHOULD MEET
MY GRANDSON LOGAN.

04:01.600 --> 04:04.233
I CAN SEE YOU TWO
HAVE A LOT IN COMMON.

04:04.233 --> 04:06.833
HE'S ALSO SMART, CHARMING,

04:09.633 --> 04:12.167
LOOKING FOR MY GLASSES,
YOU KNOW, IF YOU SEE HIM.

04:12.167 --> 04:14.200
- WELL, I WILL LET HIM KNOW.

04:17.567 --> 04:20.533
[gasps]
FRESH!

04:27.300 --> 04:28.433
- WHY ARE WE HIDING?

04:28.433 --> 04:29.700
- NO REASON.

04:29.700 --> 04:32.567
JUST SEEMED LIKE A NICE DAY
TO WEAR A TREE HAT.

04:36.333 --> 04:38.633
- HEY, YOU HAVE A CRUSH
ON A BOY.

04:38.633 --> 04:39.733
- I DO NOT.

04:39.733 --> 04:41.267
AW, WHO AM I KIDDING?

04:41.267 --> 04:43.400
HE HAS GOT EYES
THAT COULD MELT A SNOW CONE.

04:43.400 --> 04:46.433
- AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA MEET HIM
BY HIDING HERE, SO LET'S GO.

04:46.433 --> 04:47.533
- OKAY, NO, I DON'T WANT TO.

04:47.533 --> 04:48.867
- COME ON!
IT'S FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

04:48.867 --> 04:50.200
- HE LOOKS BUSY.
- JUST TALK TO HIM.

04:50.200 --> 04:51.367
OOF!

04:51.367 --> 04:52.600
- I'M SHY, OKAY?

04:52.600 --> 04:55.800

THAT'S SO ADORABLE.

04:57.833 --> 04:59.867
- OKAY, KISS AND TELL
STARTS AT 8:00.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.500
- WHICH IS WHY THE FASTEST WAY

05:01.500 --> 05:03.933
TO FIND A DATE
TO THE MOVIES IS...

05:03.933 --> 05:06.167
both: SPEED DATING!

05:06.167 --> 05:07.533
- UH...

05:07.533 --> 05:09.800
- NOW, YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS
TO TALK TO A GIRL

05:09.800 --> 05:12.133
AND GET TO KNOW HER BEFORE
MOVING ON TO THE NEXT ONE.

05:12.133 --> 05:14.267
- AND WE HANDPICKED THE GUYS

05:14.267 --> 05:16.267
SO YOU WON'T HAVE
ANY COMPETITION.

05:16.267 --> 05:18.700
- [laughs]
I CAN TOTALLY TAKE THEM.

05:18.700 --> 05:20.200
- NOW JUST GO IN THERE
AND BE YOURSELF.

05:20.200 --> 05:21.267
- GOT YA!

05:21.267 --> 05:22.767
- BUT NOT TOO MUCH OF YOURSELF.

05:22.767 --> 05:24.067
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

05:24.067 --> 05:25.933
- YOU'RE HONEST,
WHICH GIRLS LOVE,

05:25.933 --> 05:29.300
BUT SOMETIMES
YOU'RE A LITTLE TOO HONEST.

05:29.300 --> 05:31.400
- YOU HAD ONIONS TODAY,
DIDN'T YOU?

05:31.400 --> 05:33.833
I'M GETTING AN ONION-Y STINK.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.467
- THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

05:35.467 --> 05:36.533
- OH.

05:36.533 --> 05:38.333
- NOW, THE HARDEST PART
OF ANY DATE

05:38.333 --> 05:39.800
IS STARTING A CONVERSATION,

05:39.800 --> 05:41.100
SO JUST GO IN THERE

05:41.100 --> 05:43.400
AND TELL HER SOMETHING
INTERESTING ABOUT YOURSELF.

05:43.400 --> 05:44.967
- GO GET 'EM.

05:46.300 --> 05:48.700
clang!

05:48.700 --> 05:50.833

[slurping]

06:28.500 --> 06:31.367
[bell clanging]

06:31.367 --> 06:33.500
clang!
clang! clang!

06:33.500 --> 06:34.967

06:51.067 --> 06:54.833
- ALL OF THEM!
- JUST NOT WITH YOU.

06:58.333 --> 06:59.533
- [groans]

07:04.900 --> 07:07.533
- HI!
ARE YOU PEGGY?

07:07.533 --> 07:09.067
- YOU MUST BE LOGAN.

07:09.067 --> 07:11.967
WOW, YOU LOOK EXACTLY LIKE
YOUR GRANDMOTHER.

07:11.967 --> 07:13.467
- OH, I GET THAT A LOT.

07:13.467 --> 07:15.533
HEY!
GOT YOU SOME FLOWERS.

07:15.533 --> 07:17.733
THANK YOU FOR BEING SO NICE
TO MY GRANDMA.

07:17.733 --> 07:20.133
- WOW.
SHE WAS RIGHT ABOUT YOU.

07:20.133 --> 07:22.600
- OH, GRANDMA.
[chuckles]

07:22.600 --> 07:23.933
- WELL, NOW THAT
I CAN SEE AGAIN,

07:23.933 --> 07:25.600
I HAVE A LOT OF UNPACKING TO DO.

07:25.600 --> 07:27.267
BUT WE SHOULD HANG OUT SOMETIME.

07:27.267 --> 07:29.800
- OH, YES!
THAT WOULD BE...GREAT.

07:36.067 --> 07:37.967
[whimpers]

07:41.500 --> 07:43.133
- PLEASE TELL ME
WHAT IS GOING ON.

07:43.133 --> 07:45.567
I'M POSITIVE IT IS BETTER
THAN THIS BOOK.

07:45.567 --> 07:47.367
- I THINK I HAVE A CRUSH
ON THE NEW GIRL.

07:47.367 --> 07:49.500
BUT I KNOW CAMILLE STILL HAS
FEELINGS FOR ME,

07:49.500 --> 07:51.433
AND I GUESS WE KIND OF BROKE UP,

07:51.433 --> 07:54.633
BUT IT WASN'T TOTALLY CLEAR,
AND, UM...HELP!

07:54.633 --> 07:58.267
- WELL, THIS ONE
IS NOT GONNA BE EASY, HONEY.

07:58.267 --> 08:01.667
YOU HAVE TO TELL CAMILLE
YOU WANT TO DATE OTHER PEOPLE.

08:01.667 --> 08:04.600
- WHAT IS WITH YOU PARENTS AND
TELLING THE TRUTH ALL THE TIME?

08:04.600 --> 08:06.267

18:46.967 --> 18:48.500
MAYBE I RUSHED
THIS WHOLE DATE THING.

18:48.500 --> 18:50.800
- YEAH.
YOU SOUND CONFLICTED.

18:50.800 --> 18:53.833
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.700
THE MOVIE IS STARTING SOON.

18:55.700 --> 18:57.133
IT'S TIME TO PICK A GIRLFRIEND.

18:57.133 --> 18:59.400

- THERE YOU ARE.

19:11.067 --> 19:13.067
THIS MOVIE'S GONNA BE
SO ROMANTIC.

19:13.067 --> 19:16.700
- NOT AS ROMANTIC AS...
THE UNICORN PRINCESS!

19:16.700 --> 19:18.700
WHICH I JUST GOT
FOUR TICKETS TO,

19:18.700 --> 19:19.800
MUCH MORE APPROPRIATE...

19:19.800 --> 19:24.100
[whispering]
FOR THE KIDS.

19:24.100 --> 19:27.367
- A DOUBLE DATE
TO THE UNICORN PRINCESS?

19:27.367 --> 19:29.067
- IN 3-D.

19:29.067 --> 19:30.900
- YEAH.

19:30.900 --> 19:32.167
THIS ISN'T GONNA WORK OUT.

19:32.167 --> 19:34.067
- HUH?

19:34.067 --> 19:37.833
WAIT!
WE CAN STILL MAKE OUT!

19:37.833 --> 19:40.067
- HEY, WE'RE GONNA PASS
ON KISS AND TELL.

19:40.067 --> 19:42.433
- DID YOU KNOW THAT MOVIE'S
FULL OF PEOPLE KISSING?

19:42.433 --> 19:43.833
[shudders]

19:43.833 --> 19:45.667
- SO WE'RE JUST GONNA HANG OUT
IN THE ARCADE

19:45.667 --> 19:47.333
AND GO HOME WITH YOU GUYS LATER.

19:47.333 --> 19:49.267
- OH, THANK GOODNESS.

19:49.267 --> 19:52.067

19:52.067 --> 19:53.667

REALLY ANNOYING TODAY

19:53.667 --> 19:55.167
WITH ALL
THAT OVERPROTECTIVE STUFF.

19:55.167 --> 19:59.400

20:18.433 --> 20:19.533
- YOU AND CAMILLE WENT OUT,

20:19.533 --> 20:21.700
AND YOU STILL HAVE FEELINGS
FOR HER?

20:21.700 --> 20:23.033
- I'M ALSO MY OWN GRANDMA.

20:23.033 --> 20:27.333
- YEAH, I KNEW THAT TOO.

20:27.333 --> 20:30.033
YOU'RE NOT READY TO MOVE ON.
IT'S COOL.

20:30.033 --> 20:31.667
CALL ME WHEN YOU ARE, OKAY?

20:34.967 --> 20:36.533

A HUGE MISTAKE.

21:50.200 --> 21:52.500
WELL, YOU CAN'T DATE HER

21:52.500 --> 21:53.900
'CAUSE YOU'RE BOTH IDIOTS.

21:53.900 --> 21:56.367
- THAT IS HIGHLY POSSIBLE.

21:56.367 --> 21:57.800
