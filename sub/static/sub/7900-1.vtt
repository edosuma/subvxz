It's just sort of crude
and violent for my taste

10:35.435 --> 10:37.938
not to mention
just a tad misogynistic.

10:38.005 --> 10:41.474
Hey, some people
see rap as poetry.

10:41.541 --> 10:42.876
Yeah, but come on,
how many words

10:42.943 --> 10:44.344
can you rhyme
with "bitch"?

10:44.411 --> 10:46.346
GROCER:
Next, please.

10:46.413 --> 10:48.315
How we doing?

10:48.381 --> 10:51.584
Should have left when she
tried to arrest me.

[LIGHT JAZZ PLAYING]

10:55.255 --> 10:56.656
MARIN: So, Mom,
how's the new play?

10:56.724 --> 10:57.958
Are you getting
happy with it?

10:58.025 --> 10:59.559
Well, you know the thing
about me.

10:59.626 --> 11:02.395
I'm 90 percent hard work,
10 percent talent.

11:02.462 --> 11:05.699
And so far, the talent part
hasn't exactly kicked in yet.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.267
Uh-huh. Right.

11:07.334 --> 11:10.738
What's your play about?
About?

11:10.804 --> 11:13.373
Well, I'm not exactly sure,
which is a bit of a problem.

11:13.440 --> 11:16.810
But so far, it's about
a divorced woman, a writer.

11:16.877 --> 11:18.678
She's this high-strung,
over-amped, controlling,

11:18.746 --> 11:20.047
know-it-all neurotic...

11:22.682 --> 11:24.584
Who's incredibly
cute and lovable.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.920
Mm-hm.

11:26.987 --> 11:28.288
It's a comedy.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.224
So...

11:31.291 --> 11:32.392
how did you two meet?

11:32.459 --> 11:34.661
At a wine auction
at Christie's.

11:34.728 --> 11:36.663
Harry was the big buyer
of the night.

11:36.730 --> 11:40.934
I kept raising my paddle
just to get her
to smile at me.

11:41.001 --> 11:43.837
Before I knew it,
I bought
the entire collection.

11:43.904 --> 11:47.174
I mean, every known bottle
of Chateau Margaux.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.743
After that,
the least she could do

11:49.810 --> 11:52.512
was share a bottle
with me.

11:52.579 --> 11:53.814
Ever been married, Harry?

11:54.547 --> 11:55.883
No.

11:55.949 --> 11:57.384
No, I haven't.
Mom.

11:57.450 --> 12:00.020
Wow. Now, why
do you think that is?

12:00.087 --> 12:02.222
Well, some people just
don't fit the mold,

12:02.289 --> 12:03.824
and so far, you know--

12:03.891 --> 12:05.225
Hey, if it ain't broke...

12:05.292 --> 12:07.227
Exactly.
Wait a second.

12:07.294 --> 12:08.862
Aren't you like
a famous bachelor?

12:08.929 --> 12:11.531
Well, I wouldn't say
I'm famous.

12:11.598 --> 12:15.302
Yeah, didn't I read
an article about you
in New York magazine?

12:15.368 --> 12:17.204
I guess some people
find it interesting

12:17.270 --> 12:19.406
that I've escaped
the noose for so long.

12:19.472 --> 12:21.809
That was the title
of the article,
"The Escape Artist."

12:21.875 --> 12:24.744
I read that article.
That was you?

12:24.812 --> 12:27.314
Well, you were once engaged
to someone really big.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.549
Who was it?
Joan Collins? No.
No.

12:29.616 --> 12:30.818
Wait a minute okay,
Carly Simon?

12:30.884 --> 12:32.385
Yeah, somebody
cool like that.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.121
Somebody like that.
Not Martha Stewart.

12:34.187 --> 12:36.523
No! Not Martha Stewart! No.
You could just ask him.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.893
No, this is more fun.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.328
It's like I'm not here.

12:41.394 --> 12:44.197
Harry was once
engaged to Diane Sawyer.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.465
What?
Right.

12:45.532 --> 12:47.034
Diane Sawyer.
I love her.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.735
I'm impressed.
Yeah.

12:48.802 --> 12:50.403
Women your age
love that about me.

12:52.539 --> 12:55.843
You know what I mean.
Yes, I do.

12:55.909 --> 12:58.778
I mean, it's not a bad thing
to say, "women your age."

12:58.846 --> 13:00.513
Oh, no. I'm sure
it was a compliment.

13:02.015 --> 13:03.650
It's just, uh...

13:03.716 --> 13:05.552
An accurate
observation. It's--

13:05.618 --> 13:06.954
So when was this?

13:07.020 --> 13:10.690
The engagement?
Long time ago.

13:10.757 --> 13:14.227
She was this adorable,
lanky girl from Kentucky

13:14.294 --> 13:17.030
with the greatest
pair of legs
I have ever seen.

13:17.097 --> 13:18.731
Never understood her
ending up

13:18.798 --> 13:21.001
on a job where
she never showed them.

13:21.068 --> 13:23.070
You can't be serious.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.105
I mean,
she's Diane Sawyer.

13:25.172 --> 13:26.673
She goes into caves
in Afghanistan

13:26.739 --> 13:29.276
with a shmatte on her head.
Who cares about her legs?

13:30.844 --> 13:31.979
You know what?

13:32.045 --> 13:33.480
I hate to eat
and run, but--

13:33.546 --> 13:36.049
No!
No, wait. No.

13:36.116 --> 13:37.817
Come on. This is
really fascinating,

13:37.885 --> 13:39.352
what's going on
at this table.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.588
Zoe teaches women's studies
at Columbia.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.756
Okay. So this
is gonna hurt.

13:43.823 --> 13:46.526
No. Look, let's take you
and Erica for example.
Zoe--

13:46.593 --> 13:48.761
Harry, you've been
around the block
a few times. Am I right?

13:48.828 --> 13:50.730
What are you,
around 60?

13:51.598 --> 13:52.933
Sixty-three!

13:53.000 --> 13:54.434
Fantastic!

13:54.501 --> 13:56.103
Never married,
which, as we know,

13:56.169 --> 13:57.504
if you were a woman,
would be a curse.

13:57.570 --> 14:00.340
You'd be an old maid,
a spinster.
Blah, blah, blah.

14:00.407 --> 14:03.476
So instead of pitying you,
they write articles about you.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.312
Celebrate your
never marrying.

14:05.378 --> 14:08.581
You're elusive
and ungettable,
a real catch.

14:08.648 --> 14:10.650
Then, there's my
gorgeous sister here.

14:10.717 --> 14:12.019
No, wait. What--?
ZOE: Look, please--

14:12.085 --> 14:13.120
No, this is interesting.

14:13.186 --> 14:16.089
Look at her.
She is so accomplished.

14:16.156 --> 14:17.857
The most successful female
playwright since who?

14:18.791 --> 14:20.493
ZOE: Lillian Hellman?

14:20.560 --> 14:23.964
She's over 50, divorced,
and she sits in night
after night after night

14:24.031 --> 14:25.865
because available guys
her age want something--

14:25.933 --> 14:27.067
Forgive me
for saying this honey,

14:27.134 --> 14:29.069
but they want somebody
that looks like Marin.

14:29.136 --> 14:31.738
So, the whole over-50
dating scene is geared

14:31.804 --> 14:33.907
towards men leaving
older women out.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.008
And as a result,

14:35.075 --> 14:36.977
the women become more
and more productive.

14:37.044 --> 14:39.679
and therefore,
more and more interesting.

14:39.746 --> 14:42.449
Which, in turn, makes
them even less desirable

14:42.515 --> 14:44.151
because as we know, men,

14:44.217 --> 14:46.819
especially older men,
are threatened
and deathly afraid

14:46.886 --> 14:49.889
of productive
and interesting women.
It is just so clear.

14:49.957 --> 14:51.591
Single older women
as a demographic

14:51.658 --> 14:53.460
are about as fucked a group
as can ever exist.

Oh, God!

14:56.629 --> 14:58.465
What are you, possessed?

14:58.531 --> 15:00.133
How could you
say those things?

15:00.200 --> 15:02.469
It seemed
really obvious to me,
the injustice of it.

15:02.535 --> 15:03.870
Thank God men
die younger than us.

15:03.937 --> 15:06.139
It's the only

15:06.206 --> 15:07.340
Write a dissertation on it.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.608
But don't announce
to the world

15:08.675 --> 15:10.343
that I stay in
night after night

15:10.410 --> 15:12.079
after night--
And by the way,
one "night after night"

15:12.145 --> 15:13.580
would have been enough.

15:13.646 --> 15:17.417
Did you ever realize
that I stay in
as a part of my job?

15:17.484 --> 15:20.253
And why do you think
I married the director
of my plays?

15:20.320 --> 15:23.023
He was the only man
I ever saw.

15:23.090 --> 15:25.225
And anyway,
I like staying in,

15:25.292 --> 15:26.559
and I like this time
in my life.

15:26.626 --> 15:27.995

15:33.533 --> 15:36.203
Honey, what are you doing

15:36.269 --> 15:38.638
He's old.

He's fun.
He's fun?

15:40.407 --> 15:42.442
I mean, how is he fun?
He's, like, wrong.

15:42.509 --> 15:44.944
Yeah, wrong can be fun.
No. Not this wrong.

15:45.012 --> 15:46.980
He's actually incredibly
smart and fascinating.

15:47.047 --> 15:48.181
If you talked to him
about something

15:48.248 --> 15:49.749
other than
his marital status

15:49.816 --> 15:51.184
you would have found out
how smart he is,

15:51.251 --> 15:52.986
he owns, like,
10 different companies.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.621
What does that mean,
he owns 10 different
companies?

15:54.687 --> 15:57.057
It means he can't commit.
That's what it means.

15:57.124 --> 15:59.226
Not that, God forbid,

16:03.630 --> 16:06.933

and nice.

I take Lipitor.
Chew this.

19:25.865 --> 19:27.367

19:27.434 --> 19:29.502

19:35.642 --> 19:38.511
Mr. Sanborn, did you take
any Viagra today?

19:39.646 --> 19:42.181
Mr. Sanborn?
No.

19:42.915 --> 19:44.217
No Viagra.

19:44.284 --> 19:45.518
Okay, good,
just need to be sure.

19:45.585 --> 19:48.255
Because I put nitroglycerin
into your drip.

19:48.321 --> 19:51.658
And if you had taken Viagra,
the combination
could be fatal.

20:01.701 --> 20:05.204
Your dad's
gonna be okay.
He's not my dad.

20:05.272 --> 20:07.374
Oh, I'm sorry.
Your granddad's
gonna be okay.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.175

a mild heart attack.

20:19.586 --> 20:21.588

to dissolve the clot
in his artery,

20:21.654 --> 20:23.222
and it worked beautifully.

20:23.290 --> 20:24.557

20:33.933 --> 20:35.435
He's doing great.
Yeah.

20:35.502 --> 20:37.203
I gave him something
to help him sleep.

20:37.270 --> 20:38.805
It might make him
a little loopy at first

20:38.871 --> 20:41.708

it should knock him out.

30:12.778 --> 30:13.846
A friend in L.A.

30:13.913 --> 30:16.382
It's only 10:00
on the coast.

30:16.448 --> 30:18.750
And that's not
past her bedtime?

30:18.817 --> 30:22.254
So you don't
get more mellow
as the hours pass?

30:22.321 --> 30:24.256
Good night, Harry.

30:24.323 --> 30:26.558
Can I ask you
one other thing?

30:27.459 --> 30:30.229
What's with
the turtlenecks?

30:30.296 --> 30:32.398
It's the middle
of summer.
Now, seriously...

30:32.464 --> 30:34.466
why do you care
what I wear?

30:34.533 --> 30:35.701
Just curious.

30:35.767 --> 30:37.503
I like them.
I've always liked them,

30:37.569 --> 30:40.206
and I'm just
a turtleneck kind of gal.

30:41.073 --> 30:42.341
You never get hot?

30:44.443 --> 30:46.178
No.
Never?

30:47.646 --> 30:49.315
Not lately.

30:49.381 --> 30:50.516

31:02.661 --> 31:03.762
Finally.

31:05.831 --> 31:07.666
Okay, okay.

31:31.290 --> 31:32.491
Holy--!

31:36.562 --> 31:37.863
Oh, God!

31:37.930 --> 31:39.498
Oh! Ow!

31:39.565 --> 31:40.933
Oh, I'm sorry.

31:41.968 --> 31:43.469
Oh, God, am I sorry.

31:44.636 --> 31:46.238
What are you doing?!

31:46.305 --> 31:48.440
I was just trying
to find the kitchen!

31:48.507 --> 31:50.476
What? Back here?

31:50.542 --> 31:52.378
I got confused.

31:52.444 --> 31:54.947
And it was dark
and, uh...

31:55.014 --> 31:57.216
I didn't really
see anything.

31:58.150 --> 31:59.385
Just...

32:00.352 --> 32:01.487
Just your tits.

32:02.488 --> 32:03.789
And a little--

32:03.855 --> 32:04.957

32:12.864 --> 32:15.334
Goodbye, Mrs. Barry.
Goodbye?

32:15.401 --> 32:18.037
You're leaving?
Oh, no, that's not good.

32:18.104 --> 32:20.672
Been fired.
Fired?
No, you just started.

32:21.907 --> 32:24.443
Not fired, darling.
Just not needed.

32:24.510 --> 32:27.113
Not needed? Wait,
what are you talking about?

32:27.179 --> 32:29.015
Of course she's needed.
We need her.

32:29.081 --> 32:31.817
Oh, no.
I'm actually feeling
pretty perky today.

32:31.883 --> 32:33.952
Making quite a comeback.

32:34.020 --> 32:37.056
Sorry for your trouble,
Mrs. Gimble.
Take care, dear.

32:37.990 --> 32:39.858
You've been wonderful.

32:41.827 --> 32:44.263
Listen,
about last night--

32:44.330 --> 32:46.832
Yeah, how about we never
talk about that, okay?

32:46.898 --> 32:49.001
Anyway,
I was at the drugstore.

32:49.068 --> 32:50.736
Your prescriptions
were ready.

32:50.802 --> 32:52.571
They said to
take these two with food,
this one without.

32:52.638 --> 32:53.939
You were in silhouette.

32:54.006 --> 32:56.375
Yeah, I think that's
talking about it.

32:56.442 --> 32:58.044
I really didn't see
all that much.

32:58.110 --> 32:59.511
Yep, there you go.

32:59.578 --> 33:01.380
Okay, I won't
mention it again, but--

33:01.447 --> 33:03.349
Going to work, Harry.
Hey!

33:03.415 --> 33:06.352
You saw my ass.
You don't see me
acting nuts

33:06.418 --> 33:09.755
and wearing glasses
and hats and weird outfits!

33:12.758 --> 33:14.126
Yes or no?

33:14.193 --> 33:16.162
What's the deal?

33:16.228 --> 33:18.697
Can I go?
You still getting dizzy?

33:18.764 --> 33:21.500
Not as much.
Out of breath?

33:21.567 --> 33:24.636
Only sometimes.
Good.

33:24.703 --> 33:26.572
How's Erica
treating you?
Who?

33:27.939 --> 33:29.108
Erica.

33:30.176 --> 33:32.944
Oh, her.

33:33.011 --> 33:35.781
She is a major
piece of work.

33:35.847 --> 33:39.818
Doc, the woman
wears turtlenecks
in the middle of the summer.

33:39.885 --> 33:42.154
She's beyond uptight.

33:42.221 --> 33:44.790
Almost makes her fun
to be around.

33:44.856 --> 33:48.527
Uptight? That's funny,
I haven't noticed that.

33:48.594 --> 33:49.828
Try living with her.

33:51.397 --> 33:54.900
I actually saw her
naked last night.

33:54.966 --> 33:58.437
That doesn't sound
so uptight.
It was an accident.

33:58.504 --> 34:00.072
She thought
I was asleep,

34:00.139 --> 34:02.241
I thought her room
was the kitchen.

34:02.308 --> 34:05.211
You know what Freud said,
"There are no accidents."

34:06.678 --> 34:09.547
Trust me.
This was an accident.

34:11.016 --> 34:13.152
Although, why would she
be walking around naked

34:13.219 --> 34:15.687
when she knows
I'm 20 feet away?

34:15.754 --> 34:18.657
Why would you think
her bedroom was a kitchen?

34:18.724 --> 34:21.627
It was dark.
It was 2:00 in the morning.

34:21.693 --> 34:24.096
That could explain why
she was walking around naked.

34:24.163 --> 34:25.431
Deep breath.

34:25.496 --> 34:28.967
You know,
I've never seen a woman
that age naked before.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.103
You're kidding.

34:31.170 --> 34:34.340
Hey, we're not
all doctors, baby.

34:36.074 --> 34:38.244
I think she's
very beautiful.

34:38.310 --> 34:41.179
And she's a fantastic
writer, you know.

34:41.246 --> 34:43.149
No, I don't know.

34:43.949 --> 34:46.585
She's pretty major.

34:46.652 --> 34:49.755
So you date
her daughter?
Okay.

Now, she's a great chick.

after her father.

34:54.726 --> 34:57.396
Which reminds me.
Doc...

34:59.030 --> 35:00.566
What about
Mr. Midnight, here?

35:04.436 --> 35:06.672
When can I be up and running
in that department?

35:06.738 --> 35:08.540
I think Mr. Midnight
needs to stay put

35:08.607 --> 35:10.342
for another
couple of weeks.

35:10.409 --> 35:12.778
But it won't kill me
when I do it, right?

35:12.844 --> 35:15.847
No, it's exercise.
It'll be good for you.

35:15.914 --> 35:17.949
After a heart attack,
rule of thumb is:

35:18.016 --> 35:22.020
If you can climb
a flight of stairs,
you can have sex.

Not even by plane?

I don't think so.

35:50.782 --> 35:52.218
Been tough, huh?

35:52.284 --> 35:54.386
Well, I mean, he fired
his nurse after an hour,

35:54.453 --> 35:56.288
and now says
he doesn't even need one.

35:56.355 --> 35:59.291
He's a bit of
a workout. Yeah.
How are you holding up?

35:59.358 --> 36:00.692
Me?
You.

36:01.327 --> 36:02.928
Well, I'm, uh...

36:03.662 --> 36:05.364
I'm fine. Fine.

You're welcome.

takes place in Paris

36:31.357 --> 36:33.058

to French music,

36:33.124 --> 36:36.462
hoping to get inspired.
No, it's not helping at all.

36:38.497 --> 36:41.032
Well, I'm trying.

It's not exactly flowing out
of me yet, but--

36:48.006 --> 36:49.808

around 7:00?

36:52.177 --> 36:53.211
Oh.

36:54.413 --> 36:58.550
So, uh, what about
the patient?

Listen, I've decided
to get over that whole
"you saw me naked" thing.

37:39.291 --> 37:41.026
So let's just not deal
with it anymore. Okay?

37:41.092 --> 37:42.328
Good,

37:42.394 --> 37:44.563
because I have been hiding
from you all day.

37:46.231 --> 37:47.833
Do you want to come in?

37:47.899 --> 37:51.102
Well, uh, I don't want
to break your rhythm

37:51.169 --> 37:52.638
That would be
wishful thinking.

So I'm gonna
venture out there

You up to that?
Yeah. My doctor
recommended it.

38:02.614 --> 38:06.985
I gotta build up
to climbing stairs
and stuff like that.

38:08.387 --> 38:10.622
You wouldn't want
to join me?

38:10.689 --> 38:11.923
That means you
don't want me to?

38:11.990 --> 38:15.661
No. I was asking
if you wanted to.

38:15.727 --> 38:18.330
Oh, yeah I would,
of course I would,

don't like to break

38:28.574 --> 38:33.211

38:33.278 --> 38:35.614

that there are over 8000
websites that mention you?

38:43.555 --> 38:46.425
That's not possible.
Yeah, it's true.

38:46.492 --> 38:48.326

about you now,

and not because
of last night.

38:50.362 --> 38:53.264
Yeah, no, no.
I understood.

38:53.331 --> 38:54.866
Actually,
I looked you up too.

38:54.933 --> 38:56.402
You did?
Uh-huh. Yeah.

38:56.468 --> 38:59.337
I knew you grew up in L.A.,
which I thought nobody did.

38:59.405 --> 39:03.108
You started
your own record label
at 29, very impressive.

39:03.174 --> 39:06.344
Sold it at 40,
even more impressive.

39:06.412 --> 39:09.280
Then you started a magazine,
dabbled in the Internet

39:09.347 --> 39:12.317
and then you invested
in a small record company

39:12.384 --> 39:14.185

into the second largest

it goes by fast,
doesn't it?

of an eye.
Yeah.

39:30.669 --> 39:32.137

you have bowls of those
all over your house.

only the white ones.

too young for me!

you doubt it.

what were you doing
at the onset of the pain?

you chest pains?

looks perfectly normal.

in the Caribbean

01:52:20.434 --> 01:52:23.204
couldn't possibly cure
what was ailing me.

01:52:23.270 --> 01:52:26.473
So I decided
to take another
kind of trip,

01:52:26.540 --> 01:52:30.611

my past.

01:52:31.879 --> 01:52:34.248

of the women I've known

01:52:34.315 --> 01:52:37.819

I could figure out
how I arrived at being me.

Some of the ladies, I admit,
weren't too interested

01:52:53.334 --> 01:52:56.137
in seeing me,
or even speaking to me,

01:52:56.203 --> 01:52:59.941
but one day,
my losing streak ended.

01:53:00.007 --> 01:53:02.143
One of them
opened up to me.

01:53:02.209 --> 01:53:04.545
Hearing what she had
to say was no picnic,

01:53:04.611 --> 01:53:06.280
but I stuck it out
and I listened.

01:53:06.347 --> 01:53:07.882
And then I listened harder.

01:53:07.949 --> 01:53:09.951
And one of the things
I realized

01:53:10.017 --> 01:53:12.820
was I was actually
giving closure
