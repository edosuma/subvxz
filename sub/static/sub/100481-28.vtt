>> John: HI THERE!

00:32.020 --> 00:32.980
WELCOME TO THE SHOW!

00:33.020 --> 00:34.980
STILL COMING TO YOU FROM THIS

00:35.020 --> 00:35.980
WHITE VOID, WHICH, I ADMIT,

00:36.020 --> 00:36.980
LOOKS LIKE THE INSIDE OF

00:37.020 --> 00:38.460
A GHOST'S SPOOKY RECTUM.

00:39.000 --> 00:39.980
AND IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK, WITH

00:40.020 --> 00:41.980
THE TWO PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS

00:42.020 --> 00:42.980
MAKING THEIR FINAL ARGUMENTS,

00:43.020 --> 00:44.980
AND JARED KUSHNER -- HARVARD'S

00:45.020 --> 00:45.980
SHINIEST MISTAKE -- DECIDING TO

00:46.020 --> 00:47.980
MAKE THIS LAST-DITCH APPEAL TO

00:48.020 --> 00:48.980
BLACK VOTERS.

00:49.020 --> 00:50.980
>> ONE THING WE'VE SEEN IN A LOT

00:51.020 --> 00:51.980
OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY,

00:52.020 --> 00:52.980
WHICH IS MOSTLY DEMOCRAT, IS

00:53.020 --> 00:54.980
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S POLICIES

00:55.020 --> 00:55.980
ARE THE POLICIES THAT CAN HELP

00:56.020 --> 00:56.980
PEOPLE BREAK OUT OF THE PROBLEMS

00:57.020 --> 00:58.980
THAT THEY'RE COMPLAINING ABOUT,

00:59.020 --> 01:01.000
BUT HE CAN'T WANT THEM TO BE

01:01.000 --> 01:01.020
SUCCESSFUL MORE THAN THEY WANT

01:01.020 --> 01:02.040
TO BE SUCCESSFUL.

01:03.000 --> 01:03.980
>> John: WELL, FUCK YOU, JARED.

01:04.019 --> 01:04.980
I GUESS WE SHOULD ALL BE

01:05.019 --> 01:06.980
APPLAUDING YOU FOR WANTING

01:07.020 --> 01:07.980
TO BE BORN TO A BILLIONAIRE

01:08.020 --> 01:08.980
REAL-ESTATE DEVELOPER, THEN

01:09.020 --> 01:10.980
WANTING YOUR FATHER TO PLEDGE

01:11.020 --> 01:11.980
$2.5 MILLION DOLLARS TO HARVARD

01:12.020 --> 01:12.980
NOT LONG BEFORE YOU WERE

01:13.020 --> 01:14.980
ADMITTED, AND THEN FOR WANTING

01:15.020 --> 01:15.980
TO MARRY THE DAUGHTER OF THE

01:16.020 --> 01:17.980
WORLD'S MOST SUCCESSFUL LIAR.

01:18.020 --> 01:18.980
IF ONLY MORE BLACK FETUSES HAD

01:19.020 --> 01:20.980
YOUR AMBITION AND DRIVE, MAYBE

01:21.020 --> 01:21.980
THEY'D BE AS SUCCESSFUL AS YOU.

01:22.020 --> 01:23.980
BUT LOOK, THE FACT IS, THE

01:24.020 --> 01:25.980
ELECTION IS JUST TWO DAYS AWAY.

01:26.020 --> 01:26.980
AND BECAUSE OF THAT, OUR SHOW

01:27.020 --> 01:27.980
TONIGHT IS GOING TO BE A BIT

01:28.020 --> 01:28.980
DIFFERENT.

01:29.020 --> 01:30.980
BECAUSE INSTEAD OF HAVING JUST

01:31.020 --> 01:31.980
ONE MAIN STORY, WE'RE ACTUALLY

01:32.020 --> 01:32.980
GOING TO HAVE TWO, EACH FOCUSING

01:33.020 --> 01:34.460
ON A DIFFERENT ASPECT OF

01:35.000 --> 01:42.000
THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY.

01:43.000 --> 01:43.980
IT'S THE "HOME ALONE 2" OF

01:44.020 --> 01:44.980
VIRUSES: AS IT'S AMPLIFIED THE

01:45.020 --> 01:48.980
DANGERS OF AIR TRAVEL, LOTS OF

01:49.020 --> 01:49.980
IT TOOK PLACE IN NEW YORK, AND

01:50.020 --> 01:50.980
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE, FOR NO GOOD

01:51.020 --> 01:51.980
REASON, IS DONALD FUCKING TRUMP.

01:52.020 --> 01:52.980
AND I KNOW THAT THE FACT WE'RE

01:53.020 --> 01:53.980
ABOUT TO TALK ABOUT THIS AT ALL,

01:54.020 --> 01:54.980
WOULD MAKE TRUMP ROLL HIS EYES.

01:55.020 --> 01:56.980
>> THAT'S ALL I HEAR ABOUT NOW.

01:57.020 --> 01:58.640
TURN ON TELEVISION, "COVID,

01:59.000 --> 01:59.980
COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID."

02:00.020 --> 02:00.980
A PLANE GOES DOWN, 500 PEOPLE

02:01.020 --> 02:03.000
DEAD, THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT IT.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.980
"COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID."

02:06.020 --> 02:06.980
BY THE WAY, ON NOVEMBER 4TH,

02:07.020 --> 02:09.979
YOU WON'T HEAR ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

02:10.020 --> 02:11.980
COVID!

02:12.020 --> 02:13.980
COVID!

02:14.020 --> 02:15.980
>> John: BELIEVE ME, I'D LOVE

02:16.020 --> 02:17.980
NOTHING MORE THAN TO NOT TALK

02:18.020 --> 02:18.980
ABOUT COVID, AND INSTEAD RETURN

02:19.020 --> 02:19.980
TO SUBJECTS WE'D NORMALLY

02:20.020 --> 02:21.980
COVER ON THIS SHOW, LIKE

02:22.020 --> 02:22.980
SCENTED CANDLE FRAUD OR ALPACA

02:23.020 --> 02:23.980
VETERINARIAN MALPRACTICE.

02:24.020 --> 02:26.980
UNFORTUNATELY, I CAN'T DO THAT

02:27.020 --> 02:30.980
WHEN SO MANY AMERICANS ARE STILL

02:31.020 --> 02:31.980
DYING OF "COVID, COVID"

02:32.020 --> 02:32.980
EVERY DAY.

02:33.020 --> 02:33.980
FOR MANY, TRUMP'S HANDLING OF

02:34.020 --> 02:34.980
THE CORONAVIRUS IS GOING TO BE

02:35.020 --> 02:36.980
A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN HOW THEY

02:37.020 --> 02:38.980
VOTE, AND TO LISTEN TO HIM,

02:39.020 --> 02:40.000
THAT'S REALLY NOT A PROBLEM.

02:40.000 --> 02:40.960
HE'S LABELED HIS HANDLING OF

02:41.000 --> 02:43.980
THE PANDEMIC AS "TREMENDOUS,"

02:44.020 --> 02:44.980
"A-PLUS," AND SAID "NOTHING

02:45.020 --> 02:45.980
MORE COULD HAVE BEEN DONE."

02:46.020 --> 02:46.980
WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY RIDICULOUS,

02:47.020 --> 02:47.980
AS AMERICA HAS JUST 4% OF

02:48.020 --> 02:48.980
THE GLOBAL POPULATION, AND YET,

02:49.020 --> 02:51.980
ABOUT 20% OF GLOBAL CASES.

02:52.020 --> 02:52.980
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "OH,

02:53.020 --> 02:54.980
COME ON -- WHO DOESN'T KNOW

02:55.020 --> 02:56.980
TRUMP FUCKED UP THIS PANDEMIC?,"

02:57.020 --> 02:58.000
THE TRUTH IS, A LOT OF VOTERS

02:58.000 --> 02:58.960
ARE MORE THAN WILLING TO GIVE

02:59.000 --> 03:00.980
HIM THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT.

03:01.020 --> 03:01.980
>> HOW DO YOU FEEL PRESIDENT

03:02.020 --> 03:02.980
TRUMP HAS DONE IN HANDLING

03:03.020 --> 03:04.980
THE PANDEMIC?

03:05.020 --> 03:06.980
>> THE BEST HE CAN FOR SOMETHING

03:07.020 --> 03:07.980
THAT'S SO SOMEWHAT UNKNOWN.

03:08.020 --> 03:08.980
>> I THINK HE'S PROBABLY DOING

03:09.020 --> 03:09.980
THE BEST HE CAN RIGHT NOW.

03:10.020 --> 03:10.980
I MEAN, THERE IS SO MUCH MIXED

03:11.020 --> 03:12.980
INFORMATION OUT THERE AND TRYING

03:13.020 --> 03:14.980
TO DECIPHER WHAT'S FACT AND

03:15.020 --> 03:15.980
WHAT'S FICTION.

03:16.020 --> 03:17.000
>> THE PANDEMIC?

03:18.000 --> 03:21.980
NOT HIS FAULT.

03:22.020 --> 03:22.980
AND EVERYTHING THAT'S GONE ALONG

03:23.020 --> 03:23.980
WITH IT?

03:24.020 --> 03:24.980
NOT HIS FAULT.

03:25.020 --> 03:27.980
HE'S DOING THE BEST HE CAN.

03:28.020 --> 03:28.980
>> John: IS HE?

03:29.020 --> 03:30.980
I GUESS THAT DEPENDS -- DO YOU

03:31.020 --> 03:31.980
MEAN HE'S DOING THE BEST THAT

03:32.020 --> 03:32.980
ANY PRESIDENT CAN, OR THE BEST

03:33.020 --> 03:33.980
THAT HE CAN?

03:34.020 --> 03:35.880
BECAUSE IF IT'S THE SECOND ONE,

03:36.000 --> 03:36.980
YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY BE RIGHT.

03:37.020 --> 03:37.980
WE SHOULD PROBABLY ALL

03:38.020 --> 03:38.980
BE GRATEFUL HE HASN'T TRIED

03:39.020 --> 03:39.980
BOTTLING HIS URINE AND SELLING

03:40.020 --> 03:42.980
IT AS TRUMP IMMUNITY JUICE.

03:43.020 --> 03:44.520
AND LOOK, ALL PRESIDENTS,

03:45.000 --> 03:45.960
WHOEVER THEY ARE, TEND TO

03:46.000 --> 03:46.980
FACE A DEFINING CRISIS.

03:47.020 --> 03:49.000
AND THIS WAS UNQUESTIONABLY

03:49.000 --> 03:49.020
TRUMP'S.

03:49.020 --> 03:50.980
BUT HIS RESPONSE BEEN SUCH A

03:51.020 --> 03:51.980
DISASTER THAT THERE ARE MASSIVE

03:52.020 --> 03:52.980
FUCKUPS YOU MAY'VE ALREADY

03:53.020 --> 03:53.980
FORGOTTEN.

03:54.020 --> 03:54.980
REMEMBER THAT TIME HE SUGGESTED

03:55.020 --> 03:56.980
WE SHOULD LEAVE AMERICAN

03:57.020 --> 03:57.980
CITIZENS ON A CRUISE SHIP

03:58.020 --> 03:58.980
RAVAGED WITH CORONAVIRUS,

03:59.020 --> 03:59.980
BECAUSE THEY'D INCREASE

04:00.020 --> 04:01.980
THE NUMBER OF POSITIVE CASES IN

04:02.020 --> 04:02.980
THE COUNTRY, AND HE LIKED THE

04:03.020 --> 04:04.980
NUMBERS BEING WHERE THEY ARE?

04:05.020 --> 04:06.980
THAT WAS INSANE, RIGHT?

04:07.020 --> 04:07.980
AND WE COVERED THAT ON THE SHOW.

04:08.020 --> 04:10.000
IN FACT, WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

04:10.000 --> 04:10.020
CORONAVIRUS A LOT ON THE SHOW

04:10.020 --> 04:11.980
THIS YEAR.

04:12.020 --> 04:13.520
BUT WE STILL THOUGHT THAT

04:14.000 --> 04:14.980
TONIGHT, ESPECIALLY IF YOU, OR

04:15.020 --> 04:16.980
SOMEONE YOU KNOW, ALSO THINKS

04:17.019 --> 04:20.980
"NOTHING MORE COULD HAVE BEEN

04:21.019 --> 04:21.980
DONE," IT WOULD BE WORTH TAKING

04:22.019 --> 04:22.980
A LOOK AT THREE CRUCIAL AREAS

04:23.020 --> 04:23.980
WHERE MORE COULD VERY MUCH HAVE

04:24.020 --> 04:24.980
BEEN DONE.

04:25.020 --> 04:25.980
SPECIFICALLY: PREPARATION,

04:26.020 --> 04:27.980
COORDINATION, AND COMMUNICATION.

04:28.020 --> 04:28.980
AND LET'S START WITH

04:29.020 --> 04:30.980
PREPARATION.

04:31.020 --> 04:31.980
BECAUSE IT IS WORTH NOTING,

04:32.020 --> 04:32.980
PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS HAD BEEN

04:33.020 --> 04:33.980
AWARE OF A THREAT LIKE THIS

04:34.020 --> 04:34.980
FOR YEARS.

04:35.020 --> 04:35.980
GEORGE W. BUSH DEMANDED THE

04:36.020 --> 04:37.980
GOVERNMENT DEVELOP A PANDEMIC

04:38.020 --> 04:39.980
RESPONSE PLAN ALL THE WAY BACK

04:40.020 --> 04:41.980
IN 2005, AND OBAMA CREATED A

04:42.020 --> 04:44.980
PANDEMIC PREPAREDNESS TEAM,

04:45.020 --> 04:46.980
AND GAVE A SPEECH IN DECEMBER OF

04:47.020 --> 04:48.980
2014 THAT IS EERILY PRESCIENT.

04:49.020 --> 04:49.980
>> THERE MAY AND LIKELY WILL

04:50.020 --> 04:53.980
COME A TIME IN WHICH WE HAVE

04:54.020 --> 04:55.980
BOTH AN AIRBORNE DISEASE

04:56.020 --> 05:00.980
THAT IS DEADLY.

05:01.020 --> 05:02.980
AND IN ORDER FOR US TO DEAL WITH

05:03.020 --> 05:04.980
THAT EFFECTIVELY, WE HAVE TO PUT

05:05.020 --> 05:06.980
IN PLACE AN INFRASTRUCTURE --

05:07.020 --> 05:08.980
NOT JUST HERE AT HOME, BUT

05:09.020 --> 05:09.980
GLOBALLY -- THAT ALLOWS US TO

05:10.020 --> 05:11.980
SEE IT QUICKLY, ISOLATE IT

05:12.020 --> 05:14.980
QUICKLY, RESPOND TO IT QUICKLY.

05:15.020 --> 05:17.000
SO THAT IF AND WHEN A NEW STRAIN

05:18.000 --> 05:20.980
OF FLU, LIKE THE SPANISH FLU,

05:21.020 --> 05:22.980
CROPS UP FIVE YEARS FROM NOW OR

05:23.020 --> 05:23.980
A DECADE FROM NOW, WE'VE MADE

05:24.020 --> 05:24.980
THE INVESTMENT.

05:25.020 --> 05:26.980
>> John: WOW.

05:27.020 --> 05:28.980
THOSE ARE SOME SHOCKINGLY

05:29.020 --> 05:29.980
SPECIFIC PREDICTIONS.

05:30.020 --> 05:31.980
WHAT ELSE DID HE SAY THERE?

05:32.020 --> 05:32.980
"IN EXACTLY FIVE YEARS, THE

05:33.020 --> 05:33.980
WARRIORS ARE GONNA BLOW A 3-1

05:34.020 --> 05:34.980
LEAD TO THE CAVS, AND LeBRON'S

05:35.020 --> 05:35.980
GONNA HAVE A CHASE DOWN BLOCK

05:36.020 --> 05:36.980
THAT MAKES YOUR SOUL JUMP

05:37.020 --> 05:38.980
OUT OF YOUR BODY.

05:39.020 --> 05:39.980
ALSO, KUMAIL NANJIANI'S GONNA

05:40.020 --> 05:40.980
GET REALLY JACKED IN A WAY THAT

05:41.020 --> 05:42.980
YOU DON'T KNOW QUITE HOW TO FEEL

05:43.020 --> 05:43.980
ABOUT.

05:44.020 --> 05:44.980
SO PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS WERE WELL

05:45.020 --> 05:45.980
AWARE SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD

05:46.020 --> 05:46.980
HAPPEN.

05:47.020 --> 05:47.980
AND YET, IN THE YEARS BEFORE

05:48.020 --> 05:48.980
THIS OUTBREAK, TRUMP'S

05:49.020 --> 05:50.980
ADMINISTRATION NOT ONLY

05:51.020 --> 05:51.980
DISBANDED OBAMA'S PANDEMIC TEAM,

05:52.020 --> 05:53.980
THEY ALSO CUT CDC STAFF

05:54.020 --> 05:55.980
OPERATING WITHIN CHINA BY MORE

05:56.020 --> 05:56.980
THAN TWO-THIRDS, AND ENDED A

05:57.020 --> 05:58.980
PANDEMIC EARLY WARNING PROGRAM.

05:59.020 --> 06:00.820
AND EVEN ONCE THE PANDEMIC HAD

06:01.000 --> 06:02.980
BEGUN, TRUMP TOOK AN APPALLINGLY

06:03.020 --> 06:04.980
LONG TIME TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.

06:05.020 --> 06:05.980
HE'LL OFTEN COMPLAIN -- NOT

06:06.020 --> 06:07.820
WRONGLY -- THAT CHINA TOOK TOO

06:08.000 --> 06:08.980
LONG TO BE FORTHRIGHT WITH US

06:09.020 --> 06:09.980
ABOUT THE VIRUS.

06:10.020 --> 06:11.980
BUT WHAT HE DOESN'T MENTION IS

06:12.020 --> 06:12.980
THAT ONCE WE FOUND OUT ABOUT IT,

06:13.020 --> 06:15.980
WE ACTED UNFORGIVABLY SLOWLY.

06:16.020 --> 06:16.980
THE FIRST PUBLIC REPORTS OF WHAT

06:17.020 --> 06:18.980
WAS HAPPENING IN WUHAN CAME ON

06:19.020 --> 06:19.980
DECEMBER 31ST.

06:20.020 --> 06:20.980
AND YET, ALEX AZAR, TRUMP'S

06:21.020 --> 06:22.760
SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN

06:23.000 --> 06:23.980
SERVICES, COULDN'T GET A MEETING

06:24.020 --> 06:25.980
WITH TRUMP TO TALK ABOUT IT

06:26.020 --> 06:27.980
UNTIL JANUARY 18.

06:28.020 --> 06:28.980
AND EVEN WHEN HE DID, TRUMP

06:29.020 --> 06:30.980
APPARENTLY INTERRUPTED HIM

06:31.020 --> 06:31.980
TO ASK WHEN FLAVORED VAPING

06:32.020 --> 06:33.000
PRODUCTS WOULD BE BACK

06:33.000 --> 06:33.020
ON THE MARKET.

06:33.020 --> 06:34.000
WHICH, Y'KNOW...

06:35.000 --> 06:36.980
COOL.

06:37.020 --> 06:37.980
THEN, TRUMP CONTINUALLY IMPLIED

06:38.020 --> 06:39.980
THAT THE VIRUS WOULD SIMPLY GO

06:40.020 --> 06:41.980
AWAY -- DESPITE LEARNING ON

06:42.020 --> 06:43.980
FEBRUARY 26 THAT THERE WAS

06:44.020 --> 06:45.980
COMMUNITY SPREAD IN THE U.S.

06:46.020 --> 06:46.980
SOMETHING WE MIGHT'VE KNOWN

06:47.020 --> 06:48.700
SOONER, HAD WE ALSO NOT LOST

06:49.000 --> 06:49.980
A MONTH DUE TO FLAWS IN OUR

06:50.020 --> 06:53.980
TESTING PROCESS THAT WE WERE

06:54.020 --> 06:54.980
EXTREMELY SLOW TO FIX.

06:55.020 --> 06:55.980
AND YET, DESPITE ALL THIS, TRUMP

06:56.020 --> 06:57.980
LOVES TO CLAIM THAT IT DOESN'T

06:58.020 --> 06:59.980
MATTER WHAT HE DIDN'T DO -- WHAT

07:00.020 --> 07:00.980
REALLY MATTERS IS THIS.

07:01.020 --> 07:01.980
>> THIS COUNTRY IS VERY LUCKY

07:02.020 --> 07:02.980
AND I'M VERY LUCKY THAT I PUT

07:03.020 --> 07:08.000
THE BAN ON CHINA.

07:08.000 --> 07:08.020
I SWIFTLY IMPLEMENTED A TRAVEL

07:08.020 --> 07:09.980
BAN ON CHINA.

07:10.020 --> 07:10.980
>> I PUT IN THE BAN ON CHINA.

07:11.020 --> 07:11.980
>> I DID THE CHINA BAN.

07:12.020 --> 07:12.980
>> WE PUT THAT BAN ON.

07:13.020 --> 07:13.980
>> WHEN I PUT A BAN ON.

07:14.020 --> 07:14.980
>> YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER, I PUT

07:15.020 --> 07:15.980
THE BAN ON CHINA.

07:16.020 --> 07:16.980
>> BANNED TRAVEL FROM CHINA.

07:17.020 --> 07:18.980
>> WE PUT THE BAN ON CHINA.

07:19.020 --> 07:19.980
>> I PUT A BAN ON CHINA.

07:20.020 --> 07:21.980
>> BAN ON CHINA.

07:22.020 --> 07:22.980
>> John: YEAH, TO LISTEN TO

07:23.020 --> 07:24.980
TRUMP TELL IT, HE BANNED TRAVEL

07:25.020 --> 07:25.980
FROM CHINA, AND JOB DONE.

07:26.020 --> 07:26.980
SO IF YOU'VE LOST A LOVED ONE

07:27.020 --> 07:27.980
TO THIS VIRUS, I'VE GOT SOME

07:28.020 --> 07:29.980
GREAT NEWS -- YOU DIDN'T!

07:30.020 --> 07:31.460
THEY'RE COMPLETELY FINE!

07:32.000 --> 07:32.020
THEY'VE JUST BEEN BUSY

07:32.020 --> 07:32.980
JET-SETTING ALL ACROSS

07:33.020 --> 07:34.980
THE WORLD, ENJOYING LIVE

07:35.020 --> 07:35.980
PERFORMANCES WITH THOUSANDS OF

07:36.020 --> 07:36.980
THEIR CLOSEST FRIENDS, BECAUSE

07:37.020 --> 07:37.980
TRUMP PUT THE BAN ON CHINA,

07:38.020 --> 07:39.980
AND WE'RE ALL VERY LUCKY HE DID.

07:40.020 --> 07:40.980
BUT A FEW THINGS ABOUT THAT.

07:41.020 --> 07:41.980
BECAUSE WHILE HE DID INDEED

07:42.020 --> 07:42.980
IMPOSE SOME TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS

07:43.020 --> 07:44.980
ON CHINA, THEY TOOK EFFECT ON

07:45.020 --> 07:46.980
FEBRUARY 2ND -- THAT'S TWO WEEKS

07:47.020 --> 07:49.980
AFTER THE FIRST KNOWN CASE IN

07:50.020 --> 07:50.980
THE U.S., AND ALSO, AFTER 45

07:51.020 --> 07:51.980
OTHER COUNTRIES HAD ALREADY

07:52.020 --> 07:53.980
DONE SO.

07:54.020 --> 07:55.980
AND THIS "BAN" HAD SOME MAJOR

07:56.020 --> 07:57.980
EXCEPTIONS -- INCLUDING ALLOWING

07:58.020 --> 07:58.980
U.S. CITIZENS, RESIDENTS, AND

07:59.020 --> 07:59.980
THEIR IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS

08:00.020 --> 08:01.980
TO STILL COME INTO THE COUNTRY

08:02.020 --> 08:02.980
FROM CHINA -- MEANING AN

08:03.020 --> 08:04.980
ADDITIONAL 40,000 PEOPLE CAME

08:05.020 --> 08:05.980
IN FROM THERE DURING THE FIRST

08:06.020 --> 08:06.980
TWO MONTHS THAT HIS BAN WAS

08:07.020 --> 08:08.980
IN PLACE.

08:09.020 --> 08:10.980
ALSO, WE NOW KNOW THE VIRUS CAME

08:11.020 --> 08:12.980
TO THE NEW YORK CITY AREA NOT

08:13.020 --> 08:14.980
FROM CHINA, BUT PREDOMINANTLY

08:15.020 --> 08:16.980
VIA EUROPE -- AND YET, IT TOOK

08:17.020 --> 08:17.980
TRUMP AN ADDITIONAL SIX WEEKS

08:18.020 --> 08:18.980
TO PLACE ANY RESTRICTIONS ON

08:19.020 --> 08:20.980
TRAVELERS FROM THERE.

08:21.020 --> 08:22.980
AND WHEN HE FINALLY DID THAT,

08:23.020 --> 08:23.980
IT CAME IN A CHAOTIC OVAL OFFICE

08:24.020 --> 08:24.980
SPEECH WHERE HE FALSELY MADE IT

08:25.020 --> 08:25.980
SOUND LIKE SOME AMERICANS

08:26.020 --> 08:26.980
WOULDN'T BE ALLOWED BACK

08:27.020 --> 08:28.000
INTO THE COUNTRY.

08:28.000 --> 08:28.960
WHICH HAD PREDICTABLE

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
CONSEQUENCES.

08:31.000 --> 08:31.980
>> CONFUSION LEADING TO CHAOS

08:32.020 --> 08:32.980
AT U.S. AIRPORTS UNDER

08:33.020 --> 08:34.980
THE ADMINISTRATION'S

08:35.020 --> 08:36.980
EUROPEAN TRAVEL BAN.

08:37.020 --> 08:38.980
LINES STRETCHING FOR HOURS IN

08:39.020 --> 08:39.980
NEW YORK, DALLAS, AND CHICAGO'S

08:40.020 --> 08:42.980
O'HARE.

08:43.020 --> 08:44.980
>> John: YEAH, THOSE IMAGES

08:45.020 --> 08:46.000
DON'T GET ANY EASIER TO LOOK AT.

08:46.000 --> 08:46.960
PEOPLE PANICKED BY TRUMP'S

08:47.000 --> 08:47.960
ANNOUNCEMENT RUSHED INTO

08:48.000 --> 08:48.980
AIRPORTS THAT WERE NOT

08:49.020 --> 08:49.980
ADEQUATELY PREPARED TO SAFELY

08:50.020 --> 08:51.980
PROCESS THEM, WITH SOME

08:52.020 --> 08:52.980
PASSENGERS REPORTING THERE WAS

08:53.020 --> 08:54.980
NO HAND SANITIZER AVAILABLE,

08:55.020 --> 08:55.980
AND HAVING TO SHARE PENS TO FILL

08:56.020 --> 08:57.980
OUT IMMIGRATION FORMS.

08:58.020 --> 08:58.980
AND THIS WAS BEFORE MOST OF US

08:59.020 --> 08:59.980
KNEW WE SHOULDN'T BE SHARING

09:00.020 --> 09:01.980
ANYTHING WITH ANYONE.

09:02.020 --> 09:02.980
WHICH, INCIDENTALLY, IS STILL

09:03.020 --> 09:03.980
TRUE DESPITE WHAT THIS COKE

09:04.020 --> 09:05.980
BOTTLE TELLS YOU.

09:06.020 --> 09:07.980
DO NOT SHARE THAT COKE WITH

09:08.020 --> 09:08.980
GRANDMA.

09:09.020 --> 09:09.980
GET HER HER OWN, AND HAVE IT

09:10.020 --> 09:10.980
DELIVERED BY SOMEONE IN

09:11.020 --> 09:12.980
A HAZMAT SUIT.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.980
HAPPY NINETIETH, GAMMY.

09:15.020 --> 09:16.980
TRY TO STAY SAFE!

09:17.020 --> 09:17.980
SO TRUMP'S TRAVEL BAN WASN'T

09:18.020 --> 09:18.980
A BAN, WASN'T EARLY, AND DIDN'T

09:19.020 --> 09:20.980
DO WHAT HE SAID IT DID.

09:21.020 --> 09:21.980
BUT EVEN IF HE HAD ROLLED IT OUT

09:22.020 --> 09:23.980
PERFECTLY, EXPERTS WILL TELL

09:24.020 --> 09:24.980
YOU, IF YOU DECIDE TO USE TRAVEL

09:25.020 --> 09:25.980
RESTRICTIONS, THEY HAVE TO BE

09:26.020 --> 09:27.760
PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.980
BECAUSE THE BEST THEY CAN DO IS

09:30.020 --> 09:30.980
DELAY A PANDEMIC, NOT PREVENT

09:31.020 --> 09:31.980
IT.

09:32.020 --> 09:34.980
ALL THEY'LL DO IS BUY YOU

09:35.020 --> 09:35.980
A LITTLE BIT OF TIME,

09:36.020 --> 09:36.980
WHICH IS USELESS IF YOU DON'T

09:37.020 --> 09:37.980
THEN USE IT WISELY.

09:38.020 --> 09:38.980
WHICH BRINGS US TO OUR SECOND

09:39.020 --> 09:39.980
POINT, COORDINATION.

09:40.020 --> 09:40.980
AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO REMIND

09:41.020 --> 09:41.980
YOU JUST HOW BADLY THIS

09:42.020 --> 09:43.980
ADMINISTRATION COORDINATED

09:44.020 --> 09:46.980
CRUCIAL SUPPLIES, LIKE PPE.

09:47.020 --> 09:47.980
SOME MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS

09:48.020 --> 09:52.980
RESORTED TO MAKING THEIR OWN,

09:53.020 --> 09:53.980
USING SKI GOGGLES, SNORKEL

09:54.020 --> 09:54.980
MASKS, AND GARBAGE BAGS.

09:55.020 --> 09:55.980
AND YET, THE WHITE HOUSE DENIES

09:56.020 --> 09:56.980
MISHANDLING ANYTHING.

09:57.020 --> 09:57.980
THE RNC EVEN FEATURED THIS VIDEO

09:58.020 --> 09:58.980
TOUTING THE HEROISM OF FRONTLINE

09:59.020 --> 10:00.980
WORKERS, INCLUDING A CLIP OF HIM

10:01.020 --> 10:04.000
TALKING TO A NURSE PRACTITIONER

10:04.000 --> 10:04.960
IN THE OVAL OFFICE, BUT IF YOU

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
FIND THE RAW FOOTAGE OF THAT

10:09.000 --> 10:09.020
CLIP, YOU WILL SEE THE

10:09.020 --> 10:09.980
CONVERSATION THEY'RE HAVING

10:10.020 --> 10:12.980
IS PRETTY REVEALING.

10:13.020 --> 10:15.000
>> PPE HAS BEEN SPORADIC, BUT

10:15.000 --> 10:15.020
IT'S BEEN MANAGEABLE AND WE DO

10:15.020 --> 10:15.980
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO.

10:16.020 --> 10:16.980
>> SPORADIC FOR YOU, BUT NOT

10:17.020 --> 10:17.980
SPORADIC FOR A LOT OF OTHER

10:18.020 --> 10:18.980
PEOPLE.

10:19.020 --> 10:19.980
>> OH, NO, I AGREE,

10:20.020 --> 10:20.980
MR. PRESIDENT.

10:21.020 --> 10:22.000
>> BECAUSE I'VE HEARD THE

10:22.000 --> 10:22.020
OPPOSITE.

10:22.020 --> 10:24.980
I HEARD THAT THEY ARE LOADED UP

10:25.020 --> 10:26.980
WITH, WITH GOWNS NOW AND --

10:27.020 --> 10:28.000
YOU KNOW, INITIALLY, WE HAD

10:28.000 --> 10:28.020
NOTHING.

10:28.020 --> 10:28.980
WE HAD EMPTY CUPBOARDS.

10:29.020 --> 10:30.980
WE HAD EMPTY SHELVES.

10:31.020 --> 10:31.980
WE HAD NOTHING BECAUSE IT WASN'T

10:32.020 --> 10:32.980
PUT THERE BY THE LAST

10:33.020 --> 10:37.980
ADMINISTRATION.

10:38.020 --> 10:38.980
>> John: OKAY, FIRST: "SPORADIC

10:39.020 --> 10:39.980
FOR YOU, NOT SPORADIC FOR OTHER

10:40.020 --> 10:40.980
PEOPLE" IS THE LITERAL

10:41.020 --> 10:41.980
DEFINITION OF SPORADIC.

10:42.020 --> 10:43.980
AND SECOND: HIS COMPLAINT THAT

10:44.020 --> 10:44.980
HE HAD EMPTY CUPBOARDS AND

10:45.020 --> 10:45.980
SHELVES IS SLIGHTLY UNDERCUT BY

10:46.020 --> 10:46.980
THE FACT HE'D BEEN PRESIDENT

10:47.020 --> 10:48.980
FOR THREE YEARS WHEN THAT

10:49.020 --> 10:49.980
CONVERSATION TOOK PLACE.

10:50.020 --> 10:50.980
IF YOU MOVE INTO A NEW APARTMENT

10:51.020 --> 10:52.980
AND THREE YEARS LATER, THERE'S

10:53.020 --> 10:53.980
STILL NOTHING IN THE CUPBOARDS,

10:54.020 --> 10:54.980
YOU DON'T GET TO BLAME

10:55.020 --> 10:55.980
THE PREVIOUS TENANT

10:56.020 --> 10:58.980
WHEN YOU'RE HUNGRY.

10:59.020 --> 11:01.000
GO BUY SOME FUCKING FOOD.

11:01.000 --> 11:01.020
AND IT'S NOT LIKE THE

11:01.020 --> 11:03.980
ADMINISTRATION WASN'T WARNED.

11:04.020 --> 11:04.980
TAKE MIKE BOWEN, A TOP EXECUTIVE

11:05.020 --> 11:07.980
AT A PPE PRODUCTION COMPANY.

11:08.020 --> 11:08.980
FOR YEARS, HE'S BEEN SOUNDING

11:09.020 --> 11:09.980
THE ALARM THAT MOST OF

11:10.020 --> 11:10.980
THE U.S. MASK SUPPLY NOW COMES

11:11.020 --> 11:12.000
FROM ABROAD.

11:13.000 --> 11:13.980
AND IN JANUARY, SEEING WHAT WAS

11:14.020 --> 11:15.980
COMING OUR WAY, HE EMAILED

11:16.020 --> 11:16.980
EVERYONE HE COULD THINK OF IN

11:17.020 --> 11:18.980
THE GOVERNMENT, OFFERING A CLEAR

11:19.020 --> 11:19.980
PLAN TO RAMP UP PRODUCTION.

11:20.020 --> 11:22.980
>> I VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP.

11:23.020 --> 11:25.980
I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, IF I

11:26.020 --> 11:26.980
CONTACT ENOUGH PEOPLE IN THE

11:27.020 --> 11:27.980
ADMINISTRATION, SOMEBODY, ONE OF

11:28.020 --> 11:33.980
THESE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LOOK

11:34.020 --> 11:34.980
AT THIS AND GO, "HEY, THIS IS

11:35.020 --> 11:35.980
THE PROBLEM.

11:36.020 --> 11:36.980
MAYBE WE OUGHT TO CALL THIS

11:37.020 --> 11:38.000
GUY."

11:38.000 --> 11:38.020
AND NO, I COULDN'T GET ANY -- I

11:38.020 --> 11:38.980
DIDN'T GET ANY RESPONSE THERE.

11:39.020 --> 11:39.980
>> John: NOW, IN HINDSIGHT,

11:40.020 --> 11:40.980
WOULD WARNING DONALD TRUMP HAVE

11:41.020 --> 11:41.980
DONE ANYTHING?

11:42.020 --> 11:42.980
YOU'D GET INTO THE OVAL OFFICE

11:43.020 --> 11:43.980
AND GO, "SIR, A QUARTER MILLION

11:44.020 --> 11:48.980
AMERICANS ARE GONNA DIE!"

11:49.020 --> 11:49.980
AND HE'D SAY, "LIKE, ME DIE?

11:50.020 --> 11:50.980
OR JUST, LIKE, RANDOM PEOPLE?"

11:51.020 --> 11:51.980
AND YOU'D GO, "WELL,

11:52.020 --> 11:52.980
HERMAN CAIN," AND HE'D SAY,

11:53.020 --> 11:54.000
"HMM, NOT REALLY SEEING THE

11:54.000 --> 11:54.020
PROBLEM HERE," AND YOU'D SAY

11:54.020 --> 11:54.980
"IT MIGHT COST YOU THE ELECTION"

11:55.020 --> 11:56.980
AND HE'D SAY, "BUT I'LL STILL

11:57.020 --> 11:58.000
HAVE MY FANS AND RALLIES,

11:58.000 --> 11:58.020
RIGHT?"

11:58.020 --> 11:58.980
AND YOU'D SAY, "OF COURSE,

11:59.020 --> 11:59.980
THEY'LL NEVER ABANDON YOU EVEN

12:00.020 --> 12:01.000
IF YOU'RE ACTIVELY KILLING

12:01.000 --> 12:01.960
THEM," AND HE'D GO, "OKAY, NOT

12:02.000 --> 12:02.020
SEEING WHAT THE WARNING'S ABOUT

12:02.020 --> 12:02.980
HERE, PLEASE LEAVE, IT'S TIME

12:03.020 --> 12:05.000
FOR ME TO WATCH MY SHOWS."

12:05.000 --> 12:05.960
BOWEN COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
EXPLICIT ABOUT WHAT NEEDED TO

12:07.000 --> 12:07.500
HAPPEN.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
HE TOLD GOVERNMENT CONTACTS THAT

12:09.000 --> 12:09.020
PLACING LARGE, NON-CANCELABLE

12:09.020 --> 12:09.980
ORDERS WOULD ALLOW HIM TO RAMP

12:10.020 --> 12:11.980
UP PRODUCTION IMMEDIATELY,

12:12.020 --> 12:13.980
WHICH WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE --

12:14.020 --> 12:14.980
AND I QUOTE -- I THINK WE'RE

12:15.020 --> 12:16.980
IN "DEEP SHIT."

12:17.020 --> 12:18.980
BUT THE ADMINISTRATION DAWDLED,

12:19.020 --> 12:21.000
AND BOWEN LATER TESTIFIED BEFORE

12:21.000 --> 12:21.020
CONGRESS ABOUT WHAT THAT DELAY

12:21.020 --> 12:21.980
MEANT.

12:22.020 --> 12:23.640
>> I'M GETTING 500 TO 1,000

12:24.000 --> 12:26.980
EMAILS A DAY.

12:27.020 --> 12:27.980
I'M GETTING EMAILS FROM PEOPLE,

12:28.020 --> 12:28.980
NOT BUSINESSES.

12:29.020 --> 12:29.980
AND I AM GETTING EMAILS FROM

12:30.020 --> 12:32.980
MOMS.

12:33.020 --> 12:33.980
I'M GETTING EMAILS FROM

12:34.020 --> 12:37.980
OLD PEOPLE.

12:38.020 --> 12:41.980
"PLEASE, SEND ME MASKS,"

12:42.020 --> 12:42.980
>> YOU MAKE A PRODUCT THAT CAN

12:43.020 --> 12:43.980
PROTECT PEOPLE.

12:44.020 --> 12:44.980
>> I CAN'T HELP THESE -- I CAN'T

12:45.020 --> 12:46.980
HELP ALL THESE PEOPLE.

12:47.020 --> 12:48.980
>> John: YEAH, THAT MUST HAVE

12:49.020 --> 12:49.980
BEEN INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING.

12:50.020 --> 12:50.980
BECAUSE HE OFFERED

12:51.020 --> 12:51.980
THE ADMINISTRATION A CLEAR WAY

12:52.020 --> 12:53.980
TO AT LEAST MITIGATE THE DAMAGE,

12:54.020 --> 12:55.980
AND THEY DIDN'T MOVE FAST ENOUGH

12:56.020 --> 12:57.980
AND DECISIONS LIKE THAT MEANT

12:58.020 --> 12:58.980
THAT SUDDENLY -- AND ENTIRELY

12:59.020 --> 13:01.000
AVOIDABLY -- WE HAD TO SCRAMBLE

13:01.000 --> 13:01.020
FOR ESSENTIAL EQUIPMENT AT THE

13:01.020 --> 13:02.980
SAME TIME AS ALMOST EVERYONE

13:03.020 --> 13:04.000
ELSE ON EARTH.

13:05.000 --> 13:05.980
AND FOR ALL TRUMP'S SUPPOSED

13:06.020 --> 13:07.980
EXPERTISE AS A BUSINESSMAN,

13:08.020 --> 13:08.980
HIS ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH TO

13:09.020 --> 13:10.980
MANAGING THE SUPPLY CHAIN

13:11.020 --> 13:12.980
WAS A TOTAL SHAMBLES.

13:13.020 --> 13:13.980
AT FIRST, TRUMP ENCOURAGED

13:14.020 --> 13:14.980
STATES TO "GET IT THEMSELVES" --

13:15.020 --> 13:17.000
PITTING THEM AGAINST EACH OTHER

13:17.000 --> 13:17.020
AND ESSENTIALLY STARTING A

13:17.020 --> 13:18.980
BIDDING WAR.

13:19.020 --> 13:20.980
AND LATER, JARED FUCKING KUSHNER

13:21.020 --> 13:21.980
WAS MADE THE WHITE HOUSE LEAD

13:22.020 --> 13:22.980
FOR SOMETHING CALLED

13:23.020 --> 13:24.980
"THE SUPPLY CHAIN TASK FORCE."

13:25.020 --> 13:25.980
AT ONE POINT, IT TRIED TO

13:26.020 --> 13:27.640
COORDINATE THINGS DIRECTLY,

13:28.000 --> 13:28.020
WITH JARED PULLING IN A GROUP OF

13:28.020 --> 13:29.980
MOSTLY YOUNG, UNTRAINED

13:30.020 --> 13:30.980
VOLUNTEERS TO HELP VET LEADS

13:31.020 --> 13:31.980
ON PPE.

13:32.020 --> 13:32.980
HERE'S ONE OF THEM, DESCRIBING

13:33.020 --> 13:33.980
WHAT HAPPENED AFTER AN INITIAL

13:34.020 --> 13:36.980
PEP TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF

13:37.020 --> 13:37.980
TRACKING DOWN EQUIPMENT.

13:38.020 --> 13:39.980
>> EVERYONE STOOD UP AND FILED

13:40.020 --> 13:40.980
INTO DIFFERENT OFFICES, AND I

13:41.020 --> 13:41.980
REMEMBER THE ONLY PEOPLE LEFT

13:42.020 --> 13:43.980
WERE THE VOLUNTEERS.

13:44.020 --> 13:45.340
WE THOUGHT WE WOULD BE

13:46.000 --> 13:46.980
AUXILIARY SUPPORT FOR AN

13:47.020 --> 13:47.980
EXISTING PROCUREMENT TEAM THAT

13:48.020 --> 13:48.980
JUST NEEDED TO BE EXPANDED AS

13:49.020 --> 13:51.980
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE, AND WE

13:52.020 --> 13:53.000
WOULD DO DATA ENTRY FOR

13:53.000 --> 13:53.600
CONTRACTS.

13:54.000 --> 13:54.980
AND INSTEAD, WE WERE THE TEAM.

13:55.020 --> 13:56.980
I THINK WHEN PEOPLE IMAGINED

13:57.020 --> 13:57.980
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RESPONSE

13:58.020 --> 13:59.940
IN THE WAR ROOM, THEY THOUGHT IT

14:00.000 --> 14:00.980
WOULD BE THIS BIG, YOU KNOW,

14:01.020 --> 14:02.980
ENERGIZED GROUP OF EXPERTS,

14:03.020 --> 14:08.980
NOT TEN 20-YEAR-OLD VOLUNTEERS.

14:09.020 --> 14:10.000
>> John: THAT REALLY DOES NOT

14:10.000 --> 14:10.020
SOUND GOOD.

14:10.020 --> 14:10.980
AND I'M NOT SAYING YOUNG PEOPLE

14:11.020 --> 14:13.000
ARE ALL DUMB IDIOTS.

14:13.000 --> 14:13.020
MOZART COMPOSED A MINUET AT AGE

14:13.020 --> 14:14.980
SIX.

14:15.020 --> 14:17.980
THIS GUY CREATED THE DOWNFALL OF

14:18.020 --> 14:18.980
SOCIETY AT AGE 19.

14:19.020 --> 14:19.980
YOU'D JUST HOPE THAT EVERYONE

14:20.020 --> 14:20.980
ON THE FEDERAL TASK FORCE WOULD

14:21.020 --> 14:23.000
HAVE RESOURCE-MANAGEMENT

14:23.000 --> 14:23.020
EXPERIENCE THAT GOES BEYOND

14:23.020 --> 14:23.980
"I PLAYED "SETTLERS OF CATAN"

14:24.020 --> 14:27.980
AT MY FRIEND TOPHER'S ONE NIGHT,

14:28.020 --> 14:28.980
AND I ACTUALLY DID PRETTY WELL."

14:29.020 --> 14:29.980
AND THE THING IS, ONE OF THE

14:30.020 --> 14:30.980
BEST WAYS NOT TO RUN SHORT ON

14:31.020 --> 14:31.980
PPE IS TO NOT HAVE MASS

14:32.020 --> 14:33.980
COMMUNITY SPREAD.

14:34.020 --> 14:34.980
AND ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO

14:35.020 --> 14:36.980
ACHIEVE THAT IS BY PROMOTING

14:37.020 --> 14:38.980
STRONG PUBLIC-HEALTH GUIDELINES.

14:39.020 --> 14:39.980
WHICH BRINGS US TO OUR

14:40.020 --> 14:41.980
FINAL POINT, COMMUNICATION.

14:42.020 --> 14:43.980
BECAUSE TRUMP HAS REPEATEDLY

14:44.020 --> 14:45.980
UNDERMINED PUBLIC MESSAGING,

14:46.020 --> 14:47.000
FROM THE VERY START, DESPITE

14:50.000 --> 14:56.980
THE FACT THAT -- AS WE NOW KNOW

14:57.020 --> 14:59.000
-- HE KNEW EXTREMELY EARLY ON

14:59.000 --> 14:59.020
JUST HOW BAD THINGS COULD GET.

14:59.020 --> 14:59.980
>> YOU JUST BREATHE THE AIR AND

15:00.020 --> 15:00.980
THAT'S HOW IT'S PASSED.

15:01.020 --> 15:01.980
AND SO THAT'S A VERY TRICKY ONE.

15:02.020 --> 15:02.980
THAT'S A VERY DELICATE ONE.

15:03.020 --> 15:03.980
IT'S ALSO MORE DEADLY THAN YOUR,

15:04.020 --> 15:04.980
YOU KNOW, YOUR -- EVEN YOUR

15:05.020 --> 15:05.980
STRENUOUS FLUS.

15:06.020 --> 15:07.980
>> THAT'S WHAT HE SAID

15:08.020 --> 15:08.980
PRIVATELY, BUT IN PUBLIC LATER

15:09.020 --> 15:10.980
THAT MONTH, HE WAS STILL

15:11.020 --> 15:11.980
DOWNPLAYING THE SEVERITY AND

15:12.020 --> 15:12.980
SPREAD OF THE VIRUS.

15:13.020 --> 15:13.980
>> THIS IS A FLU.

15:14.020 --> 15:14.980
THIS IS LIKE A FLU.

15:15.020 --> 15:18.000
>> John: YEAH.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.980
TRUMP JUST LIED,

15:21.020 --> 15:21.980
WHICH I KNOW AT THIS POINT

15:22.020 --> 15:23.940
ISN'T SOMETHING I SHOULD HAVE TO

15:24.000 --> 15:24.020
SAY, IT SEEMS LIKE THE KIND OF

15:24.020 --> 15:24.980
THING WE ALL ALREADY KNOW, LIKE

15:25.020 --> 15:27.000
"PUPPIES ARE GOOD" AND "GEPPETTO

15:27.000 --> 15:27.020
DEFINITELY BUILT PINOCCHIO FOR

15:27.020 --> 15:28.000
WEIRD SEX STUFF."

15:28.000 --> 15:28.020
THAT REALLY SHOULDN'T

15:28.020 --> 15:29.980
BE A SURPRISE.

15:30.020 --> 15:30.980
BE HONEST: IF YOU LIVED NEXT

15:31.020 --> 15:31.980
DOOR TO A BACHELOR WHO WAS AGED

15:32.020 --> 15:32.980
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 70 AND 1,000,

15:33.020 --> 15:33.980
WHOSE ONLY FRIEND WAS A FISH,

15:34.020 --> 15:35.400
WHOSE HOUSE WAS FULL OF

15:36.000 --> 15:36.980
NOT-FOR-SALE, HANDMADE CLOCKS

15:37.020 --> 15:39.980
GOING OFF AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND

15:40.020 --> 15:40.980
ONE DAY HE SAID "GOOD NEWS, THIS

15:41.020 --> 15:42.980
LITTLE WOODEN BOY IS PINOCCHIO,

15:43.020 --> 15:43.980
HE IS MY SON," YOU'D HAVE

15:44.020 --> 15:45.000
EXACTLY TWO THOUGHTS: ONE --

15:45.000 --> 15:45.020
HE'S FUCKIN' THAT PUPPET,

15:45.020 --> 15:46.980
AND TWO -- WE HAVE TO MOVE.

15:47.020 --> 15:47.980
THE GUY WHOSE HOUSE SOUNDS LIKE

15:48.020 --> 15:50.000
A BOMB BUILT HIMSELF A SON.

15:50.000 --> 15:50.020
WE HAVE TO MOVE.

15:50.020 --> 15:50.980
NO JUDGMENT.

15:51.020 --> 15:51.980
HE FUCKS THAT PUPPET,

15:52.020 --> 15:52.980
IT'S NOT A CRIME.

15:53.020 --> 15:53.980
THERE'S NO LAW WRITTEN DOWN

15:54.020 --> 15:54.980
ANYWHERE THAT SAYS GEPPETTO'S

15:55.020 --> 15:55.980
NOT ALLOWED TO FUCK A PUPPET

15:56.020 --> 15:57.980
HE MADE WHILE HIS FISH WATCHES.

15:58.020 --> 15:59.980
I'M NOT CALLING THE COPS.

16:00.020 --> 16:01.980
I'M JUST SAYING I'M MOVING AWAY

16:02.020 --> 16:03.980
FROM GEPPETTO.

16:04.020 --> 16:04.980
AND YET, EVEN AS IT BECAME CLEAR

16:05.020 --> 16:05.980
TO EVERYONE THAT THIS WAS VERY

16:06.020 --> 16:06.980
MUCH MORE THAN THE FLU,

16:07.020 --> 16:08.980
TRUMP CONSTANTLY UNDERMINED

16:09.020 --> 16:11.980
HIS OWN ADMINISTRATION'S ADVICE.

16:12.020 --> 16:13.980
ON APRIL 3rd, THE CDC FINALLY

16:14.020 --> 16:14.980
ADVISED THAT THE PUBLIC

16:15.020 --> 16:16.980
WEAR MASKS.

16:17.020 --> 16:19.980
BUT TRUMP IMMEDIATELY UNDERCUT

16:20.020 --> 16:20.980
IT IN THE VERY PRESS CONFERENCE

16:21.020 --> 16:21.980
THAT NEWS WAS ANNOUNCED.

16:22.020 --> 16:23.980
>> THE CDC IS ADVISING THE USE

16:24.020 --> 16:25.980
OF NON-MEDICAL CLOTH FACE

16:26.020 --> 16:28.000
COVERING AS AN ADDITIONAL

16:28.000 --> 16:28.020
VOLUNTARY PUBLIC HEALTH

16:28.020 --> 16:30.000
MEASURE.

16:30.000 --> 16:30.020
SO IT'S VOLUNTARY; YOU DON'T

16:30.020 --> 16:32.980
HAVE TO DO IT.

16:33.020 --> 16:33.980
THEY SUGGESTED FOR A PERIOD OF

16:34.020 --> 16:35.980
TIME.

16:36.020 --> 16:37.980
BUT THIS IS VOLUNTARY.

16:38.020 --> 16:38.980
I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO BE

16:39.020 --> 16:39.980
DOING IT.

16:40.020 --> 16:42.000
>> John: AND JUST LIKE THAT,

16:42.000 --> 16:42.020
WEARING A MASK WAS A POLITICAL

16:42.020 --> 16:43.980
ISSUE.

16:44.020 --> 16:45.980
TRUMP HIMSELF DIDN'T WEAR A MASK

16:46.020 --> 16:46.980
IN PUBLIC UNTIL JULY, WHICH IS

16:47.020 --> 16:48.980
OBVIOUSLY DANGEROUS.

16:49.020 --> 16:49.980
YOU CAN'T EFFECTIVELY CONVINCE

16:50.020 --> 16:51.980
PEOPLE TO DO SOMETHING WHILE

16:52.020 --> 16:52.980
REFUSING TO DO IT YOURSELF.

16:53.020 --> 16:55.000
IT'S WHY SOULCYCLE INSTRUCTORS

16:56.000 --> 16:56.980
ARE ON A BIKE LIKE EVERYONE

16:57.020 --> 16:57.980
ELSE, INSTEAD OF JUST YELLING

16:58.020 --> 16:58.980
"PEDAL FASTER!"

16:59.020 --> 16:59.980
WHILE LOUNGING ON A BEAN BAG AND

17:00.020 --> 17:01.760
EATING A BUCKET OF HOT WINGS.

17:02.000 --> 17:02.980
IT'S ABOUT SETTING A GOOD

17:03.020 --> 17:03.980
EXAMPLE.

17:04.020 --> 17:04.980
AND THE THING IS,

17:05.020 --> 17:06.980
AMERICANS WERE LISTENING TO HIM.

17:07.020 --> 17:08.980
LISTEN TO THESE PEOPLE

17:09.020 --> 17:10.000
JUST A FEW WEEKS LATER.

17:10.000 --> 17:10.020
>> IT'S JUST LIKE THE FLU,

17:10.020 --> 17:10.980
RIGHT?

17:11.020 --> 17:11.980
>> WELL, IT'S NOT JUST

17:12.020 --> 17:12.980
LIKE THE FLU.

17:13.020 --> 17:15.000
IT'S FAR MORE CONTAGIOUS.

17:15.000 --> 17:15.960
>> I MEAN, WELL, I KNOW, BUT

17:16.000 --> 17:16.020
PEOPLE DIE FROM THE FLU ALSO.

17:16.020 --> 17:17.980
>> AND FAR MORE DEADLY.

17:18.020 --> 17:18.980
THEY DO DIE FROM THE FLU.

17:19.020 --> 17:19.980
>> SO TO ME, THAT'S JUST THE WAY

17:20.020 --> 17:20.980
I LOOK AT IT.

17:21.020 --> 17:21.980
>> I MEAN, IF HE'S NOT

17:22.020 --> 17:22.980
WEARING A MASK,

17:23.020 --> 17:24.000
I'M NOT GONNA WEAR A MASK.

17:24.000 --> 17:24.960
IF HE'S NOT WORRIED,

17:25.000 --> 17:25.020
I'M NOT WORRIED.

17:25.020 --> 17:25.980
>> THE PRESIDENT?

17:26.020 --> 17:27.980
>> YES, SIR.

17:28.020 --> 17:29.980
>> John: OKAY.

17:30.020 --> 17:31.980
I UNDERSTAND THAT IMPULSE, BUT

17:32.020 --> 17:32.980
"IF HE'S NOT WORRIED, I'M NOT

17:33.020 --> 17:33.980
WORRIED," IS A WEIRD THING TO

17:34.020 --> 17:37.000
SAY WHEN HE IS THE PRESIDENT,

17:37.000 --> 17:37.960
SURROUNDED BY 24/7 SECURITY AND

17:38.000 --> 17:39.980
A TEAM OF DOCTORS, AND YOU ARE

17:40.020 --> 17:41.980
NOT EVEN SURROUNDED BY A SHIRT.

17:42.020 --> 17:43.980
IT'S BEEN GENUINELY REMARKABLE

17:44.020 --> 17:44.980
JUST HOW CONSISTENTLY TRUMP HAS

17:45.020 --> 17:45.980
UNDERCUT PUBLIC-HEALTH

17:46.020 --> 17:46.980
MESSAGING.

17:47.020 --> 17:48.980
OVER A DECADE AGO, THE CDC

17:49.020 --> 17:49.980
ACTUALLY DEVELOPED GUIDELINES

17:50.020 --> 17:50.980
FOR HOW LEADERS SHOULD

17:51.020 --> 17:52.980
COMMUNICATE DURING A CRISIS.

17:53.020 --> 17:54.160
THEY ARE: BE FIRST.

17:55.000 --> 17:55.020
BE RIGHT.

17:55.020 --> 17:55.980
BE CREDIBLE.

17:56.020 --> 17:57.980
EXPRESS EMPATHY.

17:58.020 --> 17:59.980
PROMOTE ACTION.

18:00.020 --> 18:00.980
AND SHOW RESPECT.

18:01.020 --> 18:01.980
AND I'M NOT SAYING THE CDC

18:02.020 --> 18:02.980
HAS BEEN PERFECT DURING THIS

18:03.020 --> 18:04.980
PANDEMIC, BUT TRUMP DID THE

18:05.020 --> 18:05.980
PRECISE OPPOSITE OF EVERY SINGLE

18:06.020 --> 18:08.980
ONE OF THOSE.

18:09.020 --> 18:09.980
AND ON THE EMPATHY ONE -- WHICH

18:10.020 --> 18:10.980
SHOULD BE THE HARDEST TO DO

18:11.020 --> 18:11.980
BADLY, HE'S BEEN BORDERLINE

18:12.020 --> 18:13.980
SOCIOPATHIC.

18:14.020 --> 18:19.980
BECAUSE THINK ABOUT WHAT MEDICAL

18:20.020 --> 18:21.980
PROFESSIONALS HAVE HAD TO GO

18:22.020 --> 18:22.980
THROUGH AT THIS YEAR,

18:23.020 --> 18:25.000
ESPECIALLY AT THE START OF THIS

18:25.000 --> 18:25.020
CRISIS.

18:25.020 --> 18:25.980
IN NEW YORK, HOSPITALS HAD GIANT

18:26.020 --> 18:26.980
REFRIGERATED TRUCKS THAT SERVED

18:27.020 --> 18:27.980
AS MAKESHIFT MORGUES, AND THERE

18:28.020 --> 18:28.980
WERE MASS GRAVES DUG ON

18:29.020 --> 18:29.980
HART ISLAND, EVEN AS HOSPITAL

18:30.020 --> 18:31.980
WORKERS BROKE DOWN IN VIDEO

18:32.020 --> 18:32.980
TESTIMONIALS.

18:33.020 --> 18:35.980
IT WAS UTTERLY BRUTAL.

18:36.020 --> 18:36.980
AND WITH THAT IN MIND, LET'S GO

18:37.020 --> 18:40.980
BACK TO THAT OVAL-OFFICE MEETING

18:41.020 --> 18:41.980
TRUMP HAD WITH NURSES --

18:42.020 --> 18:42.980
YOU KNOW,

18:43.020 --> 18:43.980
THE ONE THEY USED IN THE RNC

18:44.020 --> 18:44.980
VIDEO.

18:45.020 --> 18:45.980
JUST WATCH TRUMP RESPOND TO

18:46.020 --> 18:47.000
SOMEONE CITING CONCERNS ABOUT

18:47.000 --> 18:47.020
WHAT HIS COLLEAGUES WERE GOING

18:47.020 --> 18:48.980
THROUGH.

18:49.020 --> 18:49.980
>> AND IF I MAY ADD, ONE BIG

18:50.020 --> 18:51.980
CONCERN THAT I HAVE IS THE

18:52.020 --> 18:52.980
POST-TRAUMATIC TRAUMA THAT A LOT

18:53.020 --> 18:54.980
OF THE NURSES AND DOCTORS AND

18:55.020 --> 18:55.980
OTHER MEMBERS OF THE HEALTHCARE

18:56.020 --> 18:56.980
TEAM WILL BE FACING IN THE

18:57.020 --> 19:01.980
FUTURE.

19:02.020 --> 19:02.980
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE SEEING

19:03.020 --> 19:04.000
DEATH --

19:04.000 --> 19:04.540
>> A LOT.

19:05.000 --> 19:05.020
A LOT.

19:05.020 --> 19:05.980
>> PROBABLY THREE OR FOUR TIMES

19:06.020 --> 19:06.980
THE AVERAGE THAN WHAT THEY

19:07.020 --> 19:08.000
NORMALLY WOULD.

19:08.000 --> 19:08.020
>> YEAH.

19:08.020 --> 19:08.980
IT'S A LOT OF DEATH.

19:09.020 --> 19:09.980
>> YES.

19:10.020 --> 19:10.980
YES, SIR.

19:11.020 --> 19:11.980

25:35.020 --> 25:35.980
A HALF IS THAT, WHEN TRUMP

25:36.020 --> 25:36.980
FIRST NOMINATED HIM, THE NEWS

25:37.020 --> 25:37.980
WAS BASICALLY GREETED WITH

25:38.020 --> 25:38.980
RELIEF.

25:39.020 --> 25:39.980
>> BARR WILL BE SEEN AS

25:40.020 --> 25:40.980
A RELATIVELY NONCONTROVERSIAL

25:41.020 --> 25:42.000
CHOICE, AN ESTABLISHMENT

25:42.000 --> 25:42.020
CHOICE.

25:42.020 --> 25:44.000
>> WILLIAM BARR IS SORT OF AN

25:44.000 --> 25:44.020
OLD ESTABLISHMENT HAND.

25:44.020 --> 25:45.980
>> HE'S AN INSTITUTIONALIST.

25:46.020 --> 25:46.980
HE'S A GROWN UP.

25:47.020 --> 25:47.980
>> HE'S AN ADULT,

25:48.020 --> 25:48.980
HE'S A GROWN UP.

25:49.020 --> 25:50.980
>> THIS IS SOMEONE WHO IS AN

25:51.020 --> 25:51.980
ADULT IN THE ROOM.

25:52.020 --> 25:53.400
>> I THINK SOMEONE LIKE

25:54.000 --> 25:55.980
BILL BARR, WHO HAS EXPERIENCE,

25:56.020 --> 25:56.980
SEEMS LIKE HE WOULD BE A BETTER

25:57.020 --> 25:57.980
ADULT IN THE ROOM FOR US.

25:58.020 --> 26:00.980
>> John: "ADULT IN THE ROOM?"

26:01.020 --> 26:02.980
LOOK, NOT ONLY IS "BEING AN

26:03.020 --> 26:03.980
ADULT" AN ABSURDLY LOW BAR TO

26:04.020 --> 26:05.980
SET FOR THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF

26:06.020 --> 26:07.980
GOVERNMENT, BUT IT ALSO IMPLIES

26:08.020 --> 26:08.980
THAT THE MAIN PROBLEM WITH TRUMP

26:09.020 --> 26:12.980
IS THAT HE IS CHILDISH.

26:13.020 --> 26:14.000
AND I KNOW THAT IT MAKES FOR

26:14.000 --> 26:14.020
A FUN BALLOON NOW AND AGAIN,

26:14.020 --> 26:15.980
BUT AT ITS CORE, "I WISH

26:16.020 --> 26:16.980
THAT WHITE NATIONALIST WITH

26:17.020 --> 26:17.980
AN AUTHORITARIAN STREAK WOULD

26:18.020 --> 26:18.980
ACT HIS AGE" IS SORT OF MISSING

26:19.020 --> 26:19.980
THE POINT HERE.

26:20.020 --> 26:21.980
BUT YOU CAN KIND OF SEE WHY

26:22.020 --> 26:22.980
PEOPLE WERE SO WILLING TO

26:23.020 --> 26:23.980
EMBRACE BARR.

26:24.020 --> 26:26.980
HE HAD PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS

26:27.020 --> 26:28.980
ATTORNEY GENERAL UNDER

26:29.020 --> 26:29.980
GEORGE H.W. BUSH, SO HE AT LEAST

26:30.020 --> 26:31.980
KNEW WHAT THE JOB INVOLVED.

26:32.020 --> 26:32.980
AND HIS TWO IMMEDIATE

26:33.020 --> 26:34.980
PREDECESSORS AS TRUMP'S A.G.

26:35.020 --> 26:35.980
WERE THE RACIST GOBLIN FORMERLY

26:36.020 --> 26:37.980
KNOWN AS JEFF SESSIONS, AND

26:38.020 --> 26:38.980
THEN, FOR A FEW CRAZY MONTHS,

26:39.020 --> 26:39.980
MATTHEW WHITAKER, A MAN WHO WAS

26:40.020 --> 26:41.980
ONCE EMBROILED IN A SCANDAL OVER

26:42.020 --> 26:43.980
A PATENT COMPANY HE WAS INVOLVED

26:44.020 --> 26:44.980
IN, WHOSE CLIENTS INCLUDED THE

26:45.020 --> 26:45.980
INVENTOR OF A "MASCULINE TOILET"

26:46.020 --> 26:47.980
FOR THE "WELL-ENDOWED."

26:48.020 --> 26:49.980
SO YEAH, BY THAT STANDARD,

26:50.020 --> 26:52.980
BARR WAS THE ADULT IN THE ROOM.

26:53.020 --> 26:53.980
BUT IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING,

26:54.020 --> 26:55.980
SOME ADULTS ARE ASSHOLES.

26:56.020 --> 26:59.980
AND BARR IS ONE OF THEM,

27:00.020 --> 27:00.980
BUT HE'S VERY MUCH MORE.

27:01.020 --> 27:01.980
HE'S A DRIVEN, DEEPLY MORALISTIC

27:02.020 --> 27:02.980
MAN WITH EXTREME VIEWS

27:03.020 --> 27:03.980
ON EXECUTIVE POWER,

27:04.020 --> 27:04.980
ACTUALLY MAKING HIM ONE OF

27:05.020 --> 27:08.000
THE MORE DANGEROUS FIGURES

27:08.000 --> 27:08.020
IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION,

27:08.020 --> 27:08.980
WHICH I KNOW IS SAYING

27:09.020 --> 27:10.000
SOMETHING.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.980
BUT IF TRUMP GETS A SECOND TERM,

27:13.020 --> 27:13.980
BARR IS ONLY GOING TO BE MORE

27:14.020 --> 27:14.980
DANGEROUS GOING FORWARD.

27:15.020 --> 27:15.980
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT

27:16.020 --> 27:16.980
BILL BARR.

27:17.020 --> 27:18.980
AND LET'S START WITH THE FACT

27:19.020 --> 27:19.980
THAT, FROM A VERY EARLY AGE,

27:20.020 --> 27:21.580
HE WAS SIMPLY A NIGHTMARE.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.860
HERE IS HIS OLD BOSS, AT BARR'S

27:24.000 --> 27:24.980
SWEARING-IN, SHARING A FUN

27:25.020 --> 27:26.980
ANECDOTE FROM HIS CHILDHOOD.

27:27.020 --> 27:28.980
>> THE NEWSPAPERS REPORT

27:29.020 --> 27:29.980
BILL BARR WAS GIVING EISENHOWER

27:30.020 --> 27:31.980
FOR PRESIDENT SPEECHES WHEN HE

27:32.020 --> 27:33.980
WAS IN KINDERGARTEN.

27:34.020 --> 27:35.980
AND HIS PARENTS PASSED ALONG

27:36.020 --> 27:37.980
THE WORD THAT YOUNG BILL WAS

27:38.020 --> 27:39.980
DISCOURSING ABOUT SEPARATION OF

27:40.020 --> 27:40.980
POWERS BEFORE HE GAVE UP HIS

27:41.020 --> 27:42.980
PACIFIER.

27:43.020 --> 27:43.980
>> John: WHAT A WEIRD THING TO

27:44.020 --> 27:45.980
SHARE ON SOMEONE'S FIRST DAY IN

27:46.020 --> 27:48.980
A NEW JOB.

27:49.020 --> 27:49.980
"HEY, EVERYONE, PLEASE WELCOME

27:50.020 --> 27:51.640
BILL -- HE'S FROM NEW YORK,

27:52.000 --> 27:52.020
AND FUN FACT, AS A CHILD,

27:52.020 --> 27:52.980
HE WAS A LITTLE NARC

27:53.020 --> 27:53.980
WHO DEVOTED HIMSELF TO AN

27:54.020 --> 27:54.980
UNHEALTHY WORSHIP OF AUTHORITY

27:55.020 --> 27:56.580
INSTEAD OF CULTIVATING ANY

27:57.000 --> 27:57.020
MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIPS.

27:57.020 --> 27:57.980
WE'RE SO GLAD TO HAVE HIM ON

27:58.020 --> 27:59.980
BOARD."

28:00.020 --> 28:01.980
VENERATION OF AUTHORITY HAS BEEN

28:02.020 --> 28:03.980
A CONSISTENT THROUGHLINE OF

28:04.020 --> 28:04.980
BARR'S LIFE.

28:05.020 --> 28:05.980
AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY IN THE

28:06.020 --> 28:07.980
ANTI-WAR '60s, HE STOOD OUT FOR

28:08.020 --> 28:08.980
BEING INCREDIBLY

28:09.020 --> 28:12.980
PRO-LAW-ENFORCEMENT -- SO MUCH

28:13.020 --> 28:13.980
SO, THAT HE BROUGHT POLICE

28:14.020 --> 28:14.980
COFFEE AS THEY ENCOUNTERED

28:15.020 --> 28:15.980
PROTESTERS, AND ONCE GOT INTO

28:16.020 --> 28:16.980
A FISTFIGHT WITH STUDENTS WHO

28:17.020 --> 28:17.980
WERE DEMONSTRATING ON CAMPUS,

28:18.020 --> 28:19.980
A STORY HE TOLD "THE NEW YORK

28:20.020 --> 28:20.980
TIMES" WHILE "LETTING OUT A BIG

28:21.020 --> 28:21.980
LAUGH."

28:22.020 --> 28:23.980
AND THAT IS JUST SAD.

28:24.020 --> 28:24.980
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TELL YOUR

28:25.020 --> 28:26.980
GRANDKIDS FUN, INSPIRING COLLEGE

28:27.020 --> 28:27.980
STORIES ABOUT HOW YOU BURNT YOUR

28:28.020 --> 28:29.980
DRAFT CARD OR WENT STREAKING

28:30.020 --> 28:30.980
ACROSS CAMPUS, BUT BARR'S WILD

28:31.020 --> 28:33.980
TALES SEEM TO BE MORE LIKE,

28:34.020 --> 28:35.980
"ONE TIME, I LICKED THE BOOT OF

28:36.020 --> 28:37.460
THE STATE SO HARD, I WAS

28:38.000 --> 28:38.980
SHITTIN' AGLETS FOR A WEEK.

28:39.020 --> 28:40.980
BEST FOUR YEARS OF MY LIFE."

28:41.020 --> 28:42.980
SO IT'S FRANKLY NOT SURPRISING

28:43.020 --> 28:44.980
THAT, AT JUST AGE 41, AFTER

28:45.020 --> 28:46.980
QUICKLY CLIMBING THE RANKS AT

28:47.020 --> 28:47.980
THE D.O.J., BARR WAS PICKED AS

28:48.020 --> 28:49.980
BUSH'S A.G., AND IMMEDIATELY

28:50.020 --> 28:50.980
MADE A NAME FOR HIMSELF

28:51.020 --> 28:52.980
AS AN ABSOLUTE HARD-LINER ON

28:53.020 --> 28:53.980
IMMIGRATION, SIGNING OFF ON A

28:54.020 --> 28:55.980
MASS-SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM,

28:56.020 --> 28:56.980
AND HAVING A VIEW OF CRIMINAL

28:57.020 --> 28:58.980
JUSTICE PERHAPS BEST SUMMED UP

28:59.020 --> 28:59.980
BY A MEMO HIS D.O.J. PRODUCED

29:00.020 --> 29:01.980
TITLED, "THE CASE FOR MORE

29:02.020 --> 29:02.980
INCARCERATION."

29:03.020 --> 29:03.980
SO HE PRESENTED HIMSELF

29:04.020 --> 29:05.980
AS A STRONG PROPONENT OF

29:06.020 --> 29:06.980
LAW AND ORDER.

29:07.020 --> 29:07.980
DON'T DO THE CRIME, IF YOU CAN'T

29:08.020 --> 29:09.980
DO THE TIME, IF BILL BARR HAS

29:10.020 --> 29:11.980
ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT IT.

29:12.020 --> 29:13.980
ALTHOUGH INTERESTINGLY, THAT

29:14.020 --> 29:15.980
PHILOSOPHY HAD SOME EXCEPTIONS

29:16.020 --> 29:17.880
WHEN IT CAME TO HIS OWN BOSSES.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.980
>> "NEW YORK TIMES" COLUMNIST

29:20.020 --> 29:20.980
WILLIAM SAFIRE, A CONSERVATIVE

29:21.020 --> 29:22.980
REPUBLICAN, OFTEN REFERRED TO

29:23.020 --> 29:24.980
BARR THEN NOT AS

29:25.020 --> 29:25.980
ATTORNEY GENERAL, BUT AS

29:26.020 --> 29:27.980
THE "COVER-UP GENERAL,"

29:28.020 --> 29:29.980
SUGGESTING HE COVERED

29:30.020 --> 29:31.980
UP BUSH'S ROLE IN IRAQ-GATE,

29:32.020 --> 29:33.980
BURYING THE INVESTIGATION OF

29:34.020 --> 29:35.640
HOW THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION

29:36.000 --> 29:36.980
ALLEGEDLY HELPED FINANCE

29:37.020 --> 29:37.980
SADDAM HUSSEIN'S WEAPONS.

29:38.020 --> 29:39.980
>> John: YEAH.

29:40.020 --> 29:40.980
THAT WAS A MAJOR SCANDAL

29:41.020 --> 29:42.980
AT THE TIME, AND YET, BARR

29:43.020 --> 29:44.980
REFUSED CONGRESS'S REQUEST TO

29:45.020 --> 29:46.980
APPOINT AN INDEPENDENT COUNSEL.

29:47.020 --> 29:47.980
AND NOT JUST THAT -- HE ALSO

29:48.020 --> 29:48.980
SUPPORTED THE PARDON OF SIX

29:49.020 --> 29:49.980
DEFENDANTS IN THE IRAN CONTRA

29:50.020 --> 29:50.980
SCANDAL.

29:51.020 --> 29:52.980
SO HIS "COVER-UP GENERAL"

29:53.020 --> 29:53.980
NICKNAME IS REALLY PRETTY FAIR,

29:54.020 --> 29:55.980
IN THAT IT TAKES SOMETHING HE IS

29:56.020 --> 29:56.980
-- ATTORNEY GENERAL -- AND ADDS

29:57.020 --> 29:58.980
AN APT DESCRIPTOR.

29:59.020 --> 30:00.980
THE SAME WAY STEVE MNUCHIN'S

30:01.020 --> 30:01.980
NICKNAME IS SECRETARY SPRINKLER.

30:02.020 --> 30:03.980
WHY?

30:04.020 --> 30:05.000
BECAUSE HE'S SECRETARY OF

30:05.000 --> 30:05.960
TREASURY, AND HE MAKES THINGS

30:06.000 --> 30:06.980
WET.

30:07.020 --> 30:07.980
NOT A DRY SEAT IN THE HOUSE WHEN

30:08.020 --> 30:09.000
THE OLE' SQUIRT LOCKER OPENS HIS

30:09.000 --> 30:09.960
HOT LITTLE MOUTH.

30:10.000 --> 30:10.980
YOU SEE IT, RIGHT?

30:11.020 --> 30:12.980
EVERYONE DEFINITELY SEES IT.

30:13.020 --> 30:14.980
AND IT'S NOT JUST THAT BARR WAS

30:15.020 --> 30:15.980
FORGIVING OF PAST PRESIDENTIAL

30:16.020 --> 30:17.980
EXCESSES.

30:18.020 --> 30:18.980
HE ALSO WORKED TO EXPAND

30:19.020 --> 30:20.980
EXECUTIVE POWER, FROM ADVISING

30:21.020 --> 30:21.980
BUSH THAT HE HAD THE LEGAL

30:22.020 --> 30:22.980
AUTHORITY TO WAGE WAR AGAINST

30:23.020 --> 30:24.980
IRAQ WITHOUT CONGRESS' CONSENT,

30:25.020 --> 30:25.980
TO WRITING A LEGAL OPINION THAT

30:26.020 --> 30:27.980
SAID THE FBI COULD SEIZE A

30:28.020 --> 30:28.980
SUSPECT ABROAD AND RETURN THEM

30:29.020 --> 30:30.980
TO THE U.S. WITHOUT FIRST

30:31.020 --> 30:31.980
OBTAINING THE FOREIGN STATE'S

30:32.020 --> 30:32.980
CONSENT.

30:33.020 --> 30:34.980
AND WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT THAT JUST

30:35.020 --> 30:35.980
30 YEARS LATER, BARR WOULD GET

30:36.020 --> 30:36.980
TO WORK FOR A MAN WHO SHARED

30:37.020 --> 30:39.980
HIS EXACT VIEWS ON CONSENT?

30:40.020 --> 30:41.940
AND AT THIS POINT, IT'S PROBABLY

30:42.000 --> 30:42.980
WORTH PAUSING FOR A MOMENT TO

30:43.020 --> 30:43.980
TALK ABOUT THE BASIS FOR A LOT

30:44.020 --> 30:45.980
OF BARR'S ACTIONS.

30:46.020 --> 30:46.980
BECAUSE HE IS A FERVENT BELIEVER

30:47.020 --> 30:49.000
IN SOMETHING KNOWN AS THE

30:49.000 --> 30:49.020
UNITARY EXECUTIVE THEORY,

30:49.020 --> 30:50.980
ALTHOUGH HE WOULDN'T LIKE ME

30:51.020 --> 30:51.980
EVEN BRINGING THIS UP.

30:52.020 --> 30:53.980
>> ONE OF THE MORE AMUSING

30:54.020 --> 30:56.980
ASPECTS OF MODERN PROGRESSIVE

30:57.020 --> 30:58.980
POLEMIC IS THEIR BREATHLESS

30:59.020 --> 31:00.980
ATTACKS ON THE "UNITARY

31:01.020 --> 31:01.980
EXECUTIVE THEORY."

31:02.020 --> 31:03.980
AHH!

31:04.020 --> 31:05.980
[LAUGHS]

31:06.020 --> 31:10.980
[APPLAUSE]

31:11.020 --> 31:13.980
>> John: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

31:14.020 --> 31:14.980
HE NOT ONLY BELITTLED AN

31:15.020 --> 31:15.980
EXTREMELY REASONABLE LEGAL

31:16.020 --> 31:16.980
CONCERN, HE TOPPED IT OFF

31:17.020 --> 31:18.980
WITH THE "AHHH!" OF A CREEPY

31:19.020 --> 31:20.980
UNCLE TRYING TO INTERACT WITH

31:21.020 --> 31:21.980
HIS BABY NIECE WHO, EVEN THOUGH

31:22.020 --> 31:23.980
SHE'S PRE-VERBAL, ALREADY KNOWS

31:24.020 --> 31:26.980
THIS GUY IS BAD NEWS.

31:27.020 --> 31:28.980
BUT THE REASON PEOPLE

31:29.020 --> 31:29.980
BREATHLESSLY ATTACK BARR'S

31:30.020 --> 31:31.980
EMBRACE OF THE UNITARY EXECUTIVE

31:32.020 --> 31:32.980
THEORY IS THAT IT TAKES A LOT OF

31:33.020 --> 31:34.980
BREATH TO EXPLAIN JUST HOW WRONG

31:35.020 --> 31:36.980
AND DANGEROUS IT IS.

31:37.020 --> 31:38.980
VERY BASICALLY, THE THEORY HOLDS

31:39.020 --> 31:39.980
THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS

31:40.020 --> 31:40.980
VIRTUALLY COMPLETE AND

31:41.020 --> 31:42.980
TOTAL EXECUTIVE POWER,

31:43.020 --> 31:43.980
AND SOME GO FURTHER,

31:44.020 --> 31:44.980
ARGUING THAT THE MAINSTREAM

31:45.020 --> 31:46.980
UNDERSTANDING OF THE SEPARATION

31:47.020 --> 31:48.980
OF POWER -- THAT THE THREE

31:49.020 --> 31:49.980
COEQUAL BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT

31:50.020 --> 31:50.980
CHECK AND BALANCE EACH OTHER --

31:51.020 --> 31:51.980
IS WRONG.

31:52.020 --> 31:54.000
AND INSTEAD, THAT EACH BRANCH

31:54.000 --> 31:54.960
HAS NEAR-TOTAL AUTHORITY OVER

31:55.000 --> 31:56.980
ITS OWN DOMAIN.

31:57.020 --> 31:58.980
BUT BARR GOES EVEN FURTHER THAN

31:59.020 --> 31:59.980
THAT, ONCE ARGUING THAT THE ONLY

32:00.020 --> 32:01.820
CHECKS ON THE PRESIDENT SHOULD

32:02.000 --> 32:02.980
BE THROUGH THE ELECTION PROCESS

32:03.020 --> 32:04.980
OR THE IMPEACHMENT PROCESS, AND

32:05.020 --> 32:05.980
THAT IS IT, WHICH IS PRETTY

32:06.020 --> 32:07.980
STARTLING, BECAUSE THAT

32:08.020 --> 32:08.980
INTERPRETATION GIVES THE

32:09.020 --> 32:09.980
PRESIDENT AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF

32:10.020 --> 32:11.980
LEEWAY.

32:12.020 --> 32:13.980
ALTHOUGH, AS BARR TELLS IT,

32:14.020 --> 32:14.980
GEORGE H.W. BUSH WAS A LITTLE

32:15.020 --> 32:16.980
MORE HESITANT, TELLING HIM,

32:17.020 --> 32:17.980
"I DON'T WANT YOU STRETCHING,

32:18.020 --> 32:19.580
I THINK THE WAY TO ADVANCE

32:20.000 --> 32:20.020
EXECUTIVE POWER IS TO WAIT AND

32:20.020 --> 32:22.980
SEE, MOVE GRADUALLY."

32:23.020 --> 32:23.980
SO BARR DIDN'T REALLY GET

32:24.020 --> 32:24.980
A CHANCE TO FULLY TEST HIS

32:25.020 --> 32:27.980
BELIEF THAT THE PRESIDENT

32:28.020 --> 32:28.980
ANSWERS TO ABSOLUTELY NOBODY,

32:29.020 --> 32:29.980
UNTIL, THAT IS, THIS GUY MOVED

32:30.020 --> 32:31.980
INTO THE WHITE HOUSE.

32:32.020 --> 32:32.980
AND PRETTY SOON, BARR SEEMED

32:33.020 --> 32:35.980
EAGER TO GET BACK INTO THE GAME.

32:36.020 --> 32:37.980
IN JUNE 2018, HE SENT THE D.O.J.

32:38.020 --> 32:39.980
AN UNSOLICITED MEMO CRITICIZING

32:40.020 --> 32:40.980
THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION, WHICH

32:41.020 --> 32:42.980
IS BASICALLY A LAWYER'S VERSION

32:43.020 --> 32:44.980
OF SLIDING INTO TRUMP'S DMs.

32:45.020 --> 32:45.980
AND IN IT, BARR ARGUED THAT

32:46.020 --> 32:47.820
MUELLER'S CORE PREMISE -- THAT

32:48.000 --> 32:48.980
THE PRESIDENT ACTS "CORRUPTLY"

32:49.020 --> 32:49.980
IF HE ATTEMPTS TO INFLUENCE

32:50.020 --> 32:50.980
A PROCEEDING IN WHICH HIS OWN

32:51.020 --> 32:52.980
CONDUCT IS BEING SCRUTINIZED --

32:53.020 --> 32:53.980
IS UNTENABLE, BECAUSE IT WOULD

32:54.020 --> 32:54.980
VIOLATE ARTICLE II OF

32:55.020 --> 32:56.980
THE CONSTITUTION, WHICH PLACES

32:57.020 --> 32:58.980
NO LIMITS ON THE PRESIDENT'S

32:59.020 --> 33:01.000
AUTHORITY TO INTERFERE

33:01.000 --> 33:01.020
WITH MATTERS THAT CONCERN

33:01.020 --> 33:02.000
HIS OWN CONDUCT.

33:03.000 --> 33:03.980
NOW THAT IS AN EXTREME

33:04.020 --> 33:05.980
INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW WITH

33:06.020 --> 33:07.980
POTENTIALLY MASSIVE

33:08.020 --> 33:08.980
IMPLICATIONS, AND YET, IN HIS

33:09.020 --> 33:09.980
CONFIRMATION HEARINGS, BARR WENT

33:10.020 --> 33:11.980
TO GREAT LENGTHS TO MAKE IT SEEM

33:12.020 --> 33:13.980
PALATABLE.

33:14.020 --> 33:14.980
AT ONE POINT, HE EMPLOYED

33:15.020 --> 33:15.980
ONE OF HIS SIGNATURE MOVES:

33:16.020 --> 33:17.980
USING BORING BUT SMART-SOUNDING

33:18.020 --> 33:18.980
LEGALESE TO COVER UP A BATSHIT

33:19.020 --> 33:20.980
PROPOSITION.

33:21.020 --> 33:22.940
HE EVEN LECTURED THE PANEL ABOUT

33:23.000 --> 33:23.980
WHAT THE WORD "CORRUPTLY"

33:24.020 --> 33:25.980
ACTUALLY MEANS.

33:26.020 --> 33:27.980
>> WHAT IT MEANS IS, USING IN

33:28.020 --> 33:29.980
THE 19TH CENTURY SENSE, IT MEANT

33:30.020 --> 33:31.980
TO INFLUENCE IN -- IN A WAY THAT

33:32.020 --> 33:33.980
CHANGES SOMETHING THAT'S GOOD

33:34.020 --> 33:35.980
AND FIT TO SOMETHING THAT'S BAD

33:36.020 --> 33:36.980
AND UNFIT -- NAMELY, THE

33:37.020 --> 33:38.980
CORRUPTION OF EVIDENCE OR THE

33:39.020 --> 33:39.980
CORRUPTION OF A DECISION MAKER.

33:40.020 --> 33:41.980
THAT'S WHAT THE WORD "CORRUPTLY"

33:42.020 --> 33:43.400
MEANS, BECAUSE ONCE YOU

33:44.000 --> 33:44.980
DISSOCIATE IT FROM THAT,

33:45.020 --> 33:47.980
IT REALLY MEANS -- VERY HARD

33:48.020 --> 33:48.980
TO DISCERN WHAT IT MEANS.

33:49.020 --> 33:49.980
IT MEANS BAD.

33:50.020 --> 33:53.980
WHAT DOES "BAD" MEAN?

33:54.020 --> 33:54.980
>> John: UH, BAD.

33:55.020 --> 33:56.980
IT MEANS BAD.

33:57.020 --> 33:58.980
BABIES AND DOGS KNOW THAT.

33:59.020 --> 33:59.980
BUT THAT IS ALMOST AN IMPRESSIVE

34:00.020 --> 34:00.980
AMOUNT OF PSEUDO-INTELLECTUAL

34:01.020 --> 34:01.980
NONSENSE.

34:02.020 --> 34:02.980
I KIND OF WANTED HIM TO KEEP

34:03.020 --> 34:03.980
GOING.

34:04.020 --> 34:04.980
"WHAT DOES "BAD" MEAN?

34:05.020 --> 34:05.980
WHAT DOES ANY WORD MEAN?

34:06.020 --> 34:06.980
IS SPEECH ITSELF NOT MERELY

34:07.020 --> 34:07.980
A COLLECTION OF SOUNDS, AND

34:08.020 --> 34:08.980
IN THAT SENSE, SPECIFICALLY

34:09.020 --> 34:09.980
THE 12TH CENTURY SENSE, ISN'T

34:10.020 --> 34:10.980
"BAD" SIMPLY A NOISE TO WHICH

34:11.020 --> 34:12.980
WE HAVE ASCRIBED MEANING?

34:13.020 --> 34:13.980
"BAD" IS A HUMAN CONSTRUCT,

34:14.020 --> 34:16.000
BUT FROM A PURELY OBJECTIVE

34:16.000 --> 34:16.020
STANDPOINT, IT HAS NO MORE

34:16.020 --> 34:17.980
MEANING THAN THE SOUND

34:18.020 --> 34:18.980
"PLORFBOR" OR "GLOPNUM."

34:19.020 --> 34:19.980
IT'S A VOCAL NOISE AND NOTHING

34:20.020 --> 34:20.980
MORE.

34:21.020 --> 34:21.980
ANYWAY, THAT IS WHY I THINK

34:22.020 --> 34:22.980
THE PRESIDENT SHOULD BE ALLOWED

34:23.020 --> 34:24.980
TO BE A TYRANT."

34:25.020 --> 34:26.980
AND THE THING IS, IF YOU STRIP

34:27.020 --> 34:27.980
ALL OF THAT RHETORICAL BLUSTER

34:28.020 --> 34:29.980
AWAY, THE ARGUMENT YOU'RE

34:30.020 --> 34:31.980
BASICALLY LEFT WITH IS THIS.

34:32.020 --> 34:33.000
>> ARTICLE II ALLOWS ME TO DO

34:33.000 --> 34:33.020
WHATEVER I WANT.

34:33.020 --> 34:34.980
>> IT'S A THING CALLED

34:35.020 --> 34:35.980
ARTICLE II.

34:36.020 --> 34:36.980
NOBODY EVER MENTIONS

34:37.020 --> 34:37.980
ARTICLE II.

34:38.020 --> 34:40.000
>> THEN I HAVE AN ARTICLE II,

34:40.000 --> 34:40.020
WHERE I HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO

34:40.020 --> 34:42.980
WHATEVER I WANT AS PRESIDENT,

34:43.020 --> 34:45.000
BUT I DON'T EVEN TALK ABOUT

34:45.000 --> 34:45.020
THAT.

34:45.020 --> 34:45.980
>> John: THAT'S RIGHT.

34:46.020 --> 34:46.980
HE HAS THE RIGHT TO DO WHATEVER

34:47.020 --> 34:48.980
HE WANTS, BUT HE DOESN'T EVEN

34:49.020 --> 34:49.980
TALK ABOUT IT.

34:50.020 --> 34:50.980
WHICH YOU HAVE TO ADMIT

34:51.020 --> 34:51.980
IS PRETTY COOL OF HIM.

34:52.020 --> 34:52.980
IT'S WHAT LEADERSHIP IS ALL

34:53.020 --> 34:53.980
ABOUT.

34:54.020 --> 34:54.980
AS TEDDY ROOSEVELT ONCE SAID,

34:55.020 --> 34:56.980
"CARRY A BIG STICK AND SPEAK

34:57.020 --> 34:57.980
LOUDLY ABOUT HOW SOFTLY YOU

34:58.020 --> 34:58.980
SPEAK ABOUT WHAT A BIG STICK

34:59.020 --> 35:00.980
YOU'RE CARRYING."

35:01.020 --> 35:01.980
AND WHILE TRUMP HAS BEEN

35:02.020 --> 35:03.980
GRUMBLING LATELY THAT BARR

35:04.020 --> 35:05.980
SHOULD'VE DONE MORE TO PUNISH

35:06.020 --> 35:07.980
COMES TO PLAYING DEFENSE FOR

35:08.020 --> 35:09.980
TRUMP, BARR HAS BEEN RELENTLESS.

35:10.020 --> 35:11.400
HE FAMOUSLY PROVIDED AN

35:12.000 --> 35:12.960
EXCULPATORY SUMMARY OF MUELLER'S

35:13.000 --> 35:13.980
REPORT WEEKS BEFORE MAKING IT

35:14.020 --> 35:15.980
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE.

35:16.020 --> 35:16.980
AND SINCE THEN, HIS D.O.J. HAS

35:17.020 --> 35:18.980
SUGGESTED A LIGHTER SENTENCE FOR

35:19.020 --> 35:20.980
ROGER STONE, IS TRYING TO DROP

35:21.020 --> 35:21.980
THE CHARGES AGAINST

35:22.020 --> 35:22.980
MICHAEL FLYNN -- WHO, REMEMBER,

35:23.020 --> 35:24.980
HAD PLED GUILTY -- REMOVED AN

35:25.020 --> 35:25.980
ATTORNEY FROM OFFICE WHO WAS

35:26.020 --> 35:27.980
INVESTIGATING TRUMP'S

35:28.020 --> 35:28.980
ASSOCIATES, SUED JOHN BOLTON TO

35:29.020 --> 35:30.980
TRY AND STOP THE RELEASE OF HIS

35:31.020 --> 35:31.980
BOOK, AND AT ONE POINT, TRIED TO

35:32.020 --> 35:32.980
HAVE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT REPLACE

35:33.020 --> 35:33.980
TRUMP AS THE DEFENDANT IN

35:34.020 --> 35:35.980
A DEFAMATION SUIT ARISING FROM

35:36.020 --> 35:37.980
TRUMP'S STATEMENT THAT A WOMAN

35:38.020 --> 35:38.980
WHO HAD ACCUSED HIM OF RAPE WAS

35:39.020 --> 35:41.980
"NOT MY TYPE."

35:42.020 --> 35:42.980
ALL OF WHICH IS DEFINITELY WHAT

35:43.020 --> 35:44.980
THE FOUNDERS HAD IN MIND WHEN

35:45.020 --> 35:45.980
THEY DRAFTED ARTICLE II.

35:46.020 --> 35:47.980
SO YOU CAN SEE WHY SOME HAVE

35:48.020 --> 35:49.980
ARGUED THAT BARR IS TRUMP'S

35:50.020 --> 35:51.980
DREAM A.G.

35:52.020 --> 35:52.980
BUT MORE INTERESTINGLY,

35:53.020 --> 35:54.980
TRUMP MAY ALSO BE BARR'S DREAM

35:55.020 --> 35:57.980
PRESIDENT, SOMEONE WHO IS

35:58.020 --> 35:58.980
THE IDEAL VESSEL FOR BARR'S

35:59.020 --> 35:59.980
DECADES-LONG PURSUIT OF

36:00.020 --> 36:01.980
A UNITARY EXECUTIVE.

36:02.020 --> 36:03.980
AND NOT JUST THAT -- BECAUSE

36:04.020 --> 36:04.980
TRUMP MAY ALSO GIVE BARR

36:05.020 --> 36:05.980
A CHANCE TO PUSH HIS

36:06.020 --> 36:06.980
UNCOMPROMISING MORAL VISION

36:07.020 --> 36:08.980
ONTO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY.

36:09.020 --> 36:10.520
AND IT IS UNCOMPROMISING.

36:11.000 --> 36:11.980
BARR BLAMES WHAT HE SEES AS

36:12.020 --> 36:13.980
SOCIETY'S ILLS ON MORAL DECAY.

36:14.020 --> 36:15.980
HE ONCE SAID, IN AN ATTACK ON

36:16.020 --> 36:16.980
THE LIBERALISM OF THE '60s,

36:17.020 --> 36:18.980
"WE SEE AROUND US THE GRIM

36:19.020 --> 36:19.980
HARVEST OF THE PERMISSIVE

36:20.020 --> 36:21.980
SOCIETY: BROKEN HOMES,

36:22.020 --> 36:22.980
FATHERLESS CHILDREN,

36:23.020 --> 36:24.980
WIDESPREAD DRUG ADDICTION,

36:25.020 --> 36:26.980
TEENAGE PREGNANCY, OVER A

36:27.020 --> 36:28.520
MILLION ABORTIONS A YEAR,

36:29.000 --> 36:30.980
CRACK BABIES, AND DRUG WARS."

36:31.020 --> 36:32.980
AND TIME HAS NOT MODERATED HIS

36:33.020 --> 36:33.980
VIEWS, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES

36:34.020 --> 36:36.980
TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE.

36:37.020 --> 36:37.980
WHEN PROTESTS ERUPTED

36:38.020 --> 36:38.980
THIS SUMMER IN THE WAKE OF

36:39.020 --> 36:39.980
GEORGE FLOYD'S MURDER,

36:40.020 --> 36:40.980
HE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT

36:41.020 --> 36:41.980
SYSTEMIC RACISM IN

36:42.020 --> 36:42.980
POLICE DEPARTMENTS

36:43.020 --> 36:44.980
DOES NOT EXIST.

36:45.020 --> 36:46.980
AND LATE LAST YEAR, SEEMED TO

36:47.020 --> 36:47.980
THREATEN COMMUNITIES WHO EVEN

36:48.020 --> 36:49.460
DARED TO PROTEST AGAINST

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
THE POLICE.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.980
>> THEY HAVE TO START SHOWING,

36:54.020 --> 36:55.980
MORE THAN THEY DO, THE RESPECT

36:56.020 --> 36:57.980
AND SUPPORT THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT

36:58.020 --> 36:58.980
DESERVES.

36:59.020 --> 37:00.980
AND IF COMMUNITIES DON'T GIVE

37:01.020 --> 37:02.980
THAT SUPPORT AND RESPECT, THEY

37:03.020 --> 37:04.980
MIGHT FIND THEMSELVES WITHOUT

37:05.020 --> 37:05.980
THE POLICE PROTECTION THEY

37:06.020 --> 37:07.980
NEED.

37:08.020 --> 37:08.980
>> John: YEAH, THAT'S NOT HOW IT

37:09.020 --> 37:09.980
SHOULD WORK, BILL.

37:10.020 --> 37:11.980
A COMMUNITY SHOULDN'T EARN

37:12.020 --> 37:12.980
PROTECTION BY RESPECTING

37:13.020 --> 37:13.980
THE POLICE.

37:14.020 --> 37:15.980
POLICE SHOULD EARN RESPECT BY

37:16.020 --> 37:16.980
PROTECTING THE COMMUNITY.

37:17.020 --> 37:18.980
BECAUSE ONE, THEY WORK FOR US.

37:19.020 --> 37:21.980
AND TWO, THEY WORK FOR US!

37:22.020 --> 37:24.980
AT HIS CORE, BARR IS CLEARLY

37:25.020 --> 37:26.980
THE SAME KID WHO TOOK SO MUCH

37:27.020 --> 37:28.980
JOY IN BEATING UP PROTESTORS AT

37:29.020 --> 37:29.980
COLUMBIA, ONLY NOW HE HAS THE

37:30.020 --> 37:31.980
FORCE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

37:32.020 --> 37:32.980
AT HIS DISPOSAL.

37:33.020 --> 37:33.980
AND HE HAS BEEN WILLING TO

37:34.020 --> 37:34.980
USE IT.

37:35.020 --> 37:36.980
>> POLICE FORCIBLY REMOVING

37:37.020 --> 37:37.980
DEMONSTRATORS MONDAY TO CLEAR A

37:38.020 --> 37:39.980
PATH FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP TO WALK

37:40.020 --> 37:40.980
TO SAINT JOHN'S CHURCH, DAMAGED

37:41.020 --> 37:42.980
BY ARSON, FOR A PHOTO OP THAT

37:43.020 --> 37:45.980
SPARKED OUTRAGE.

37:46.020 --> 37:47.980
THE A.G. WAS THERE, TOO, AND

37:48.020 --> 37:48.980
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SAYS

37:49.020 --> 37:49.980
HE GAVE THE ORDER TO INCREASE

37:50.020 --> 37:50.980
THE SECURE PERIMETER AROUND

37:51.020 --> 37:51.980
THE WHITE HOUSE.

37:52.020 --> 37:53.980
BUT NOW BARR SAYS IT WAS NOT HIS

37:54.020 --> 37:54.980
CALL TO USE AGGRESSIVE MEASURES.

37:55.020 --> 37:57.000
"I'M NOT INVOLVED IN GIVING

37:57.000 --> 37:57.960
TACTICAL COMMANDS LIKE THAT,"

37:58.000 --> 37:58.980
HE TOLD THE ASSOCIATED PRESS.

37:59.020 --> 37:59.980
ADDING, HIS ATTITUDE WAS,

38:00.020 --> 38:01.980
"GET IT DONE," BUT HE DIDN'T

38:02.020 --> 38:04.000
SAY, "GO DO IT."

38:05.000 --> 38:05.980
>> John: OKAY, THAT IS CLEARLY

38:06.020 --> 38:08.980
UNBELIEVABLY WEASELLY,

38:09.020 --> 38:10.000
BUT I WILL SAY, I'M GLAD THAT

38:10.000 --> 38:10.020
SOMEONE FINALLY FOUND THE

38:10.020 --> 38:10.980
PERFECT WORDS TO DESCRIBE

38:11.020 --> 38:11.980
THE ROLE I BELIEVE THE QUEEN

38:12.020 --> 38:13.980
PLAYED IN DIANA'S DEATH.

38:14.020 --> 38:14.980
MAYBE SHE DIDN'T SAY "GO DO IT,"

38:15.020 --> 38:15.980
BUT HER ATTITUDE WAS DEFINITELY

38:16.020 --> 38:18.980
"GET IT DONE."

38:19.020 --> 38:20.980
BUT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THAT

38:21.020 --> 38:21.980
OPERATION WAS A RESULT OF BARR'S

38:22.020 --> 38:22.980
DIRECT ORDERS OR JUST HIS

38:23.020 --> 38:24.980
GENERAL ATTITUDE, HE MADE HIS

38:25.020 --> 38:25.980
SUPPORT FOR IT AFTERWARDS VERY

38:26.020 --> 38:27.000
CLEAR.
