WEBVTT

00:09.043 --> 00:10.378
Okay, there's Chyna.

00:10.411 --> 00:11.479
How's my breath?

00:16.283 --> 00:17.818
Why did you do that?

00:17.851 --> 00:20.588
I'm the one
asking her out!

00:20.621 --> 00:23.191
Oh. I had garlic
pancakes for breakfast

00:23.224 --> 00:26.227
and I wanted to know
if you could smell them.

00:26.260 --> 00:29.330
Yes! I can smell them!

00:33.467 --> 00:35.803
So, Chyna,

00:35.836 --> 00:37.605
that $200 million movie

00:37.638 --> 00:39.473
based on the
popular game
opens this weekend.

00:39.507 --> 00:44.378
Oh! You mean,
 Tic-tac-toe: The Movie?

00:44.412 --> 00:47.615
I have been dying
to see it ever since
I saw the trailer!

00:47.648 --> 00:51.485
"In a world torn apart
by the war between
the X's and the O's,

00:53.254 --> 00:55.256
"three rebels,
Tic, Tac, and Toe

00:55.289 --> 00:59.427
"must fight for
the future of mankind."

00:59.460 --> 01:01.329
I know! I heard
it's even better than

01:01.362 --> 01:04.364
Duck, Duck, Goose:
 The Movie.

01:04.397 --> 01:07.868
And, I happen to have
two tickets to see it
on Saturday night.

01:07.901 --> 01:11.172
Really? That's awesome!
Have a great time.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.313
Wow.

01:19.347 --> 01:24.585
That was
the saddest thing
I've ever seen.

01:24.618 --> 01:27.188
And I've seen
a grown man
riding a moped.

01:27.221 --> 01:30.124
Hey! My dad cares
about the environment!

01:31.259 --> 01:34.328
Look, when it
comes to women,

01:34.362 --> 01:36.564
subtlety is
not the way to go.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.666
You have to ask them out
over and over again,

01:38.699 --> 01:44.438
and eventually
you'll wear them down
and they'll stop saying no.

01:44.472 --> 01:46.274
Really?
Does that work?

01:46.307 --> 01:47.508
Watch and learn.

01:50.444 --> 01:53.314
Hey, Olive.
Want to go out with me
Saturday night?

01:53.347 --> 01:55.249
I'd rather be tied to
a cactus in the desert

01:55.283 --> 01:56.717
and slowly eaten
by buzzards.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.288
See?

02:00.321 --> 02:02.256
She didn't say no.

02:04.225 --> 02:06.160
* Ooh, ooh
 Doo, doo

02:06.194 --> 02:08.562
* Ooh, ooh
 Doo, doo

02:08.596 --> 02:09.663
Whoo!

02:09.697 --> 02:11.565
* Everybody's got that thing

02:11.599 --> 02:13.434
* Something different
 we all bring

02:13.467 --> 02:15.269
* Don't you let 'em
 clip your wings

02:15.303 --> 02:17.238
* You got it
 You got it

02:17.271 --> 02:18.906
* We're on fire and we blaze

02:18.939 --> 02:20.474
* In extraordinary ways

02:20.508 --> 02:22.610
* 365 days

02:22.643 --> 02:24.412
* We got it
 We got it

02:24.445 --> 02:25.679
* You can dream it

02:25.713 --> 02:27.581
* You can be it

02:27.615 --> 02:28.649
* If you can feel it

02:28.682 --> 02:32.286
* You can believe it

02:32.320 --> 02:35.189
* 'Cause I am, you are, we are

02:35.223 --> 02:39.593
* Exceptional
 Exceptional

02:39.627 --> 02:43.331
* Yeah, I am, you are, we are

02:43.364 --> 02:47.201
* Exceptional
 Exceptional

02:47.235 --> 02:49.737
* Ooh, ooh, ooh

02:49.770 --> 02:50.471
* Ooh, ooh

02:50.504 --> 02:52.540
Whoo!

02:57.778 --> 03:01.549
So, Paisley, even though
we're partnered on
this psychology project,

03:01.582 --> 03:03.484
I want you to know
that I'll be in charge.

03:03.517 --> 03:06.354
So don't worry,
you'll get an easy A.

03:06.387 --> 03:10.258
Oh, I like my A's
over easy.

03:11.559 --> 03:14.228
Anyway, my theory is,

03:14.262 --> 03:15.696
if you place a weak person
in a position of authority,

03:15.729 --> 03:18.432
they'll go mad with power.

03:18.466 --> 03:19.633
So for our subject,

03:19.667 --> 03:21.635
we just need to find
someone weak.

03:21.669 --> 03:23.571
Well, don't pick me.
I'm not weak.

03:23.604 --> 03:24.705
I don't know
my own strength.

03:26.374 --> 03:28.309
"Strength" means
"address," right?

03:30.678 --> 03:33.781
I mean, we need
to find someone
totally powerless,

03:33.814 --> 03:35.249
completely lacking in respect.

03:38.352 --> 03:41.389
Guys, "Kick Me" signs
go on the back.

03:41.422 --> 03:43.591
It doesn't work
if I can see it.

03:43.624 --> 03:45.793
Ow!

03:45.826 --> 03:47.561
How did you
read that sign
from back there?

03:48.396 --> 03:49.563
What sign?

03:56.437 --> 03:57.571
Okay, tiger.

03:57.605 --> 03:58.706
There's Chyna.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.274
Now remember,

04:00.308 --> 04:02.643
don't take no
for an answer.

04:02.676 --> 04:03.811
You really think
I can do this?

04:03.844 --> 04:04.312
No.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.516
Yeah,
you're probably right.

04:08.549 --> 04:09.550
I just said don't take
no for an answer!

04:09.583 --> 04:11.685
Go!

04:13.721 --> 04:15.323
Hey, Chyna.

04:15.356 --> 04:15.856
Will you go out with me?

04:16.857 --> 04:20.761
Fletcher, I'm sorry, but no.

04:20.793 --> 04:22.563
I don't think
it's a good idea.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.465
I understand.
Will you go out with me?

04:26.367 --> 04:29.803
As I said
four seconds ago, no.

04:29.837 --> 04:31.605
I don't think
it's a good idea.

04:31.639 --> 04:34.442
But, you understand,
Totally.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.310
Uh, sorry.

04:36.344 --> 04:39.847
Let's change the subject.
Will you go out with me?

04:39.880 --> 04:41.649
Hey, look!
The Distraction Club
is meeting after school.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.817
Really?

04:50.458 --> 04:52.860
Relax, Chyna,
you're not too late.

04:52.893 --> 04:54.562
Sure, Cameron
took the sign down,

04:54.595 --> 04:55.863
but you can
still kick him.

04:57.765 --> 04:59.500
That's not why I'm running.

04:59.533 --> 05:00.734
Fletcher won't stop
asking me out.

05:00.768 --> 05:02.470
Why?

05:02.503 --> 05:03.871
I'm guessing
it's because he likes me.

05:05.773 --> 05:07.675
Why?

05:07.708 --> 05:10.578
I'm just afraid that
if I keep
rejecting Fletcher,

05:10.611 --> 05:12.780
he'll hate me and
it'll ruin our friendship.

05:12.813 --> 05:16.850
But if I say yes,
and we go out
and it ends badly,

05:16.884 --> 05:19.353
that will also
ruin our friendship.

05:19.387 --> 05:21.422
Why are you
so worried about
ruining our friendship?

05:21.455 --> 05:23.391
We're not friends.

05:23.424 --> 05:25.693
I mean my friendship
with Fletcher.

05:25.726 --> 05:27.495
Here's what you do.

05:27.528 --> 05:31.732
Next time he asks
you out, say yes.

05:31.765 --> 05:33.534
But then
we'll be going out.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.371
You have so much to learn.

05:37.405 --> 05:39.373
Guys only want
what they can't have.

05:39.407 --> 05:42.510
Once you say yes,
he'll immediately
lose interest.

05:42.543 --> 05:43.944
Huh. And that's
happened to you?

05:44.678 --> 05:45.913
No.

05:47.715 --> 05:51.419
Obviously not, because,
well, look at me.

05:53.887 --> 05:56.557
Thanks, Lexi.
It's really nice of you
to give me advice.

05:56.590 --> 05:59.460
In fact, you do know
a lot about boys.

05:59.493 --> 06:01.395
So while
I have you here,

06:01.429 --> 06:02.563
I wouldn't mind
picking your brain
on a few other things.

06:02.596 --> 06:04.131
Hey, look!

06:04.164 --> 06:05.766
The Convenient Excuse Club
is meeting after school.

06:05.799 --> 06:07.701
Oh, really? Where?

06:08.502 --> 06:09.570
Oh.

06:13.607 --> 06:16.544
I'm beginning to think
there are too many clubs
at this school.

06:21.815 --> 06:24.752
I'm ready
to take notes for our
psychology experiment.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.691
Psychology starts with a "P."

06:30.724 --> 06:33.461
Okay, I'll go
to the bathroom and
I'll be right back.

06:34.728 --> 06:35.996
New plan,
let me do everything.

06:39.833 --> 06:42.202
Oh.
Congratulations, Cameron,

06:42.235 --> 06:44.572
you've been
unanimously chosen
to handle the most

06:44.605 --> 06:46.440
important job in school!

06:46.474 --> 06:47.775
You're the new hall monitor!

06:47.808 --> 06:49.877
Really? Awesome!

06:51.779 --> 06:54.448
Sorry, hall monitor,
you've been replaced.

07:02.490 --> 07:05.459
Let me (EXCLAIMS)clear.

07:05.493 --> 07:10.798
That would be so cool,
because then we'd be
able to see your bones.

07:12.900 --> 07:17.204
I mean, Cameron,
you're the new
human hall monitor.

07:17.237 --> 07:18.639
You get to enforce
all the important rules,

07:18.672 --> 07:21.008
like no running
in the halls.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.710
I don't know.

07:22.743 --> 07:25.479
Nagging everybody
to follow the rules?

07:25.513 --> 07:27.848
Hall monitor doesn't
sound very fun.

07:27.881 --> 07:29.883
You're right.
I know what!

07:29.917 --> 07:31.952
I'll give you
an even cooler job!

07:31.985 --> 07:36.624
You're gonna be
Corridor Sheriff!

07:36.657 --> 07:38.759
Ooh, now tYeah.ounds fun!

07:40.293 --> 07:42.663
Do I geNo. horse?

07:42.696 --> 07:46.767
Then how am I gonna
ride off into the sunset?

07:46.800 --> 07:50.037
Why would you want to?
You'd get horribly burned.

07:55.676 --> 07:59.647
Sometimes, the best way
to trick a woman
is to catch her off guard.

08:00.881 --> 08:01.882
Observe.

08:02.950 --> 08:03.951
Olive! Will you
go out with me?

08:03.984 --> 08:06.286
((GROANS))

08:06.319 --> 08:07.655
My eyes!

08:08.789 --> 08:10.558
Life gave me lemonade!

08:10.591 --> 08:12.893
There's nothing
left to do with it!

08:15.696 --> 08:17.064
Uh, Chyna...

08:17.097 --> 08:19.567
Yes.
I'll go out with you.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.068
What?

08:21.101 --> 08:21.569
I wanna go out with you.

08:22.736 --> 08:24.572
Oh.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.074
You seem
a little disappointed.

08:28.676 --> 08:30.043
I'm sorry, but...

08:30.077 --> 08:32.546
I was expecting fireworks.

08:32.580 --> 08:34.847
Well, that's just not
how things happen
in the real world.

08:34.881 --> 08:35.883
(FIREWORKS)

08:38.986 --> 08:42.623
There they are.

08:42.655 --> 08:44.792
The batteries
must have been low in my
remote control detonator.

08:46.927 --> 08:47.094
Ooh.

08:49.000 --> 08:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:59.106 --> 09:04.612
Welcome to
the International
House of Whatever.

09:05.946 --> 09:07.815
Today our "whatever"
is balls.

09:07.848 --> 09:10.918
Meatballs, melon balls,
matzo balls...

09:10.951 --> 09:13.821
You even have to eat
sitting on yoga balls.

09:17.157 --> 09:19.159
Whoa! Okay.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.763
Can I start you off
with a salad ball?

09:28.401 --> 09:30.604
Actually,
I'm here on a date.

09:30.638 --> 09:32.640
I took your advice
and said "yes,"

09:32.673 --> 09:35.108
so hopefully Fletcher
will start losing interest
in me very soon.

09:37.044 --> 09:39.647
Happy six-hour
anniversary, sweetie!

09:43.383 --> 09:44.985
Whoa!

09:45.018 --> 09:45.953
Customer down!

09:52.826 --> 09:54.795
Fletcher,
what are you doing?

09:54.828 --> 09:58.098
Taking pictures
for our scrapbook
commemorating our romance.

09:59.199 --> 10:00.668
Hmm.

10:00.701 --> 10:01.835
Whoa!

10:02.903 --> 10:03.937
Customer down!

10:10.010 --> 10:11.779
Wow!

10:11.812 --> 10:13.180
Some of these pictures
are of times

10:13.213 --> 10:15.916
I didn't even know
you were around.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.718
Oh, great.

10:17.751 --> 10:19.953
Now I'll have
a picture of you
looking at the pictures.

10:22.055 --> 10:23.791
Whoa!

10:23.824 --> 10:25.092
Customer down!

10:30.698 --> 10:31.899
Okay. If we're gonna
do well on our assignment,

10:31.932 --> 10:35.202
we need to make Cameron
mad with power.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.671
Which means we'll need
some serious rule-breaking.

10:37.705 --> 10:38.906
Okay.

10:40.874 --> 10:43.711
No. I said
"rule breaking."

10:43.744 --> 10:46.780
I know. I heard you.

10:46.814 --> 10:49.116
I just hate that
this thing thinks
it's my ruler.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.217
I didn't vote for it.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.654
Just stick to the plan.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.760
Hey, Corridor Sheriff.

11:00.493 --> 11:01.829
Ma'am.

11:02.996 --> 11:06.099
Hope no one breaks
any rules around here.

11:06.133 --> 11:06.700
Look!
I'm running in the halls!

11:08.869 --> 11:10.971
Man, can you believe this?

11:11.004 --> 11:11.905
Paisley's running
in the halls!

11:11.939 --> 11:12.840
Uh, you sure?

11:12.873 --> 11:14.842
I'm running in the hall!

11:17.010 --> 11:18.445
Yes, I'm sure!

11:18.478 --> 11:19.880
You're Corridor Sheriff!
Go after her!

11:22.883 --> 11:25.919
What are I can't.g? Hurry!

11:25.953 --> 11:28.155
There's no running
in the halls.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.857
But you know what
would really help?

11:29.890 --> 11:32.025
You're not getting a horse!

11:32.059 --> 11:34.895
I'm running in the halls!
I'm running in the hall!

11:38.832 --> 11:40.934
(WHISPERING) Lexi,
you've gotta help me.

11:40.968 --> 11:42.035
Fletcher's getting
really clingy.

11:42.970 --> 11:43.871
Why are you whispering?

11:50.010 --> 11:50.844
Go! Get out of here! Go!

11:50.878 --> 11:52.279
Psst! Psst! Psst!

11:55.148 --> 11:57.317
You see what
I'm dealing with?

12:00.921 --> 12:02.756
I just wanna
let you know,

12:02.790 --> 12:04.992
you're the most
beautiful girl
I've ever seen.

12:06.326 --> 12:09.296
Um, Chyna,

12:09.329 --> 12:11.098
your boyfriend
is hitting on me.

12:14.001 --> 12:15.869
Awkward!

12:20.073 --> 12:24.912
Please, just tell me how
I can get out of this without
hurting his feelings.

12:24.945 --> 12:27.014
Just get him to
break up with you

12:27.047 --> 12:30.150
by being the meanest,
nastiest girlfriend
in the world.

12:31.885 --> 12:33.553
Criticize
everything he does.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.522
Does that work for you?

12:35.555 --> 12:37.190
(SCOFFS) No.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.761
No one's gonna
break up
with Lexi Reed.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.198
Again, look at me.

12:51.872 --> 12:53.140
All right,
Corridor Sheriff.

12:53.173 --> 12:54.107
Remember,
you're in charge.

12:54.141 --> 12:56.076
What you say goes.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.310
If someone
doesn't listen,

12:57.344 --> 12:58.378
throw 'em in the box!

13:00.047 --> 13:02.950
I'm sorry.
I wasn't listening.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.184
I'll get in the box.

13:04.217 --> 13:06.086
No!

13:06.119 --> 13:07.988
Look! I'm writing
in the halls!

13:13.126 --> 13:14.962
Good for you, Paisley!

13:14.995 --> 13:16.229
When'd you
learn to write?

13:18.198 --> 13:22.135
That's graffiti!
She's vandalizing
the school!

13:22.169 --> 13:25.072
You have the power
to do something! Go.

13:25.105 --> 13:27.107
Paisley! Give me
that marker right now!

13:28.942 --> 13:31.178
You forgot
to dot the "I."

13:33.246 --> 13:37.184
Wow, Cameron!
You make a great
smiley face!

13:39.286 --> 13:41.288
But, Olive, yours isn't
very good at all.

13:49.329 --> 13:53.100
So, did Fletcher finally
come to his senses
and break up with you?

13:53.133 --> 13:56.203
No. But I'm sure
I can drive him away.

13:56.236 --> 13:59.172
Well, you picked
the perfect outfit.

14:05.913 --> 14:07.147
Hey, Chyna.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.883
What kind of
boyfriend are you?

14:09.917 --> 14:12.052
I show up for a date
and you don't even
bring me flowers?

14:16.256 --> 14:18.425
Well,
these are tiger lilies!

14:18.458 --> 14:19.292
I hate tiger lilies!

14:21.661 --> 14:24.064
You don't even know
my favorite flower

14:24.097 --> 14:27.034
is the Ecuadorian
Bonnet Orchid

14:27.067 --> 14:30.203
that only grows
in the shadow of the
Pululahua Volcano?

14:31.204 --> 14:32.372
Here you go.

14:33.273 --> 14:34.908
Well... (SNIFFS)

14:34.942 --> 14:36.944
This smells too good!

14:40.280 --> 14:42.115
Uh, I got you some water.

14:42.149 --> 14:44.051
Room temperature,
just the way you like it.

14:49.256 --> 14:51.224
This is warm!

14:51.258 --> 14:52.425
But you just said
you liked it
room temperature!

14:52.459 --> 14:54.361
Not the temperature
of this room!

14:54.394 --> 14:56.129
I want it

14:56.163 --> 14:57.330
the temperature
of the room that

14:57.364 --> 14:59.266
I'm thinking of
in my mind!

15:03.370 --> 15:05.939
Chyna, look.

15:05.973 --> 15:07.274
We need to talk
about our relationship.

15:09.376 --> 15:12.345
I think I know where
you're going with this.

15:12.379 --> 15:15.115
When we started
seeing each other,

15:15.148 --> 15:16.216
I thought it was
just what I needed.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.319
But it turns out...

15:19.352 --> 15:21.254
Just blurt it out!
I can take it!

15:23.423 --> 15:25.025
This is really hard
for me to say.

15:26.293 --> 15:28.061
That's why
I recorded this song!

15:33.333 --> 15:35.302
* When two people marry

15:35.335 --> 15:37.304
FLETCHER: (SINGING)
 * It's as sweet as a berry

15:38.505 --> 15:41.274
* I propose

15:41.308 --> 15:43.310
* A great dress
 you'll be wearing

15:43.343 --> 15:45.178
* And they'll serve
 pickled herring

15:46.446 --> 15:49.249
* I propose

15:49.282 --> 15:51.118
* Don't put me in disposal

15:51.151 --> 15:53.420
* Please accept my proposal

15:54.521 --> 15:56.256
* It will rain raisin bread

15:56.289 --> 15:59.359
* From a big dragon's head

15:59.392 --> 16:00.293
* On the day of the wedding

16:00.327 --> 16:02.262
* We all can go sledding

16:06.433 --> 16:09.036
* I propose

16:13.040 --> 16:17.010
Chyna Parks,
would you make me the
happiest man on Earth,

16:17.044 --> 16:18.478
and do me the honor
of being my

16:18.511 --> 16:20.180
date to my cousin's
wedding this weekend?

16:24.784 --> 16:27.020
How can I say no?

16:27.054 --> 16:30.057
Literally. I'm trying
to think of a way I can
say no and I can't.

16:38.131 --> 16:41.268
Congratulations
on the wedding.

16:41.301 --> 16:42.469
You know,
for 20 bucks,

16:42.502 --> 16:44.271
I could get you
a driver and a limo.

16:44.304 --> 16:47.307
Sure!
That's a great deal!

16:47.340 --> 16:49.309
FYI, the driver's my mom,

16:49.342 --> 16:53.213
the limo's a minivan,
and one of you has to
sit in a car seat.

16:53.246 --> 16:55.348
Things with Fletcher
are out of control.

16:56.216 --> 16:57.150
Saw that coming.

16:58.618 --> 17:00.320
But you're the one
who told me
to ask him out!

17:00.353 --> 17:04.491
Chyna, you can't
spell blame without "bla."

17:06.159 --> 17:07.359
What does that even mean?

17:09.862 --> 17:12.365
Come on!
You've gotta help me
get out of this wedding!

17:12.398 --> 17:14.300
Don't worry.
I know what to do.

17:15.102 --> 17:16.269
Good.

17:16.303 --> 17:19.306
Watch carefully.
It's very subtle.

17:19.339 --> 17:23.210
Fletcher,
Chyna is not into you.

17:23.242 --> 17:25.845
She never was, and
she never will be.

17:25.877 --> 17:27.614
The only reason
she agreed to
go out with you

17:27.646 --> 17:30.417
was to get you
to leave her alone!

17:30.450 --> 17:32.119
The mere sight of you
sickens her!

17:36.389 --> 17:37.157
Fle...

17:39.459 --> 17:42.362
What was that?
That wasn't subtle!

17:42.395 --> 17:46.133
Did I say subtle?
I meant brutal.

17:46.166 --> 17:48.435
I'm always mixing
those two words up.

17:50.503 --> 17:53.406
We're running out of time
to complete our experiment.

17:53.440 --> 17:56.243
So when Cameron comes by,
I want you to litter.

17:56.276 --> 17:59.179
I'll try, but
I don't know if I can
give birth to puppies.

18:02.149 --> 18:03.150
Forget it.
I'll do it myself.

18:07.654 --> 18:09.656
Yeah! That's right!
I littered!

18:09.689 --> 18:12.659
What are you going
to do about it,
Corridor Sheriff?

18:12.692 --> 18:15.328
I'm gonna join in!

18:15.362 --> 18:17.330
That looks like fun!

18:17.364 --> 18:20.233
Whee!
It's snowing inside!

18:22.169 --> 18:24.337
Well, how about
I do this to your badge?

18:28.175 --> 18:29.642
Good idea!

18:29.676 --> 18:31.411
I should go undercover!

18:31.444 --> 18:34.447
Maybe then
I'll catch someone
breaking the rules!

18:34.481 --> 18:37.617
I'm breaking the rules!
Lock me up!

18:37.650 --> 18:39.886
Oh, wait, never mind,
I can't
trust you to do that!

18:39.919 --> 18:42.155
So I'm gonna
put myself in jail!

18:42.955 --> 18:45.158
Ha!

18:45.192 --> 18:47.160
Actually, there wasn't
much need for the jail,

18:47.194 --> 18:48.561
so I turned it into
a bed and breakfast.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.398
That is it!

18:51.431 --> 18:54.201
You are the worst
Corridor Sheriff ever!

18:54.234 --> 18:55.535
You are a joke!

18:55.568 --> 18:56.903
But look who's
laughing now!

18:56.936 --> 18:58.338
(LAUGHING CRAZILY)

19:11.618 --> 19:14.321
And that concludes our
psychological experiment,

19:14.354 --> 19:17.757
"How to Drive a Calm Person
To The Brink of Madness."

19:20.593 --> 19:21.661
How dare you two
manipulate me

19:21.694 --> 19:24.297
when I was trying
to manipulate you!

19:24.331 --> 19:26.566
I'm the puppet master!
Me! Me!

19:26.599 --> 19:29.336
(SCREAMING)

19:29.369 --> 19:32.305
And that was
some bonus footage.

19:35.742 --> 19:37.610
(ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING)

19:41.781 --> 19:44.717
Look at all those couples.
We're much happier.

19:44.751 --> 19:46.753
Us single guys
have the right idea.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.288
(SOBBING)

19:53.560 --> 19:56.496
(SOBS) You're right.
It's all a facade.

19:59.666 --> 20:01.768
CHYNA: (SINGING)
 * I really need you, Fletcher

20:01.801 --> 20:04.637
* Like a patient
 needs a stretcher

20:04.671 --> 20:05.338
* As a friend

20:07.507 --> 20:09.509
* So many things
 you've seen me through

20:09.542 --> 20:12.245
* That really awful
 stomach flu

20:12.279 --> 20:14.414
* As a friend

20:14.447 --> 20:16.449
* And you showed me art
 that was abstract

20:16.483 --> 20:19.252
* You brought me sushi
 and we snacked

20:19.286 --> 20:21.721
* As a friend

20:21.754 --> 20:23.590
* The day you helped me
 fix my phone

20:23.623 --> 20:26.025
* My weird obsession
 with hambone

20:26.058 --> 20:28.695
* As a friend

20:28.728 --> 20:30.497
* Please don't tell me
 that we're through

20:30.530 --> 20:32.432
* I want to always
 be with you

20:33.400 --> 20:35.702
* As a friend

20:38.705 --> 20:41.641
Fletcher, I don't want
things to be weird
between us anymore.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.410
You're one of
my best friends,

20:43.443 --> 20:45.278
and I miss you.

20:45.312 --> 20:47.280
Make me the happiest
girl in the world

20:47.314 --> 20:47.347
and say you forgive me.

20:53.853 --> 20:54.654
I do.

20:54.687 --> 20:58.291
(CHUCKLES)

20:58.325 --> 21:01.060
I'm so glad
things can go back
to the way they were

21:01.093 --> 21:01.127
'cause I love you.

21:03.330 --> 21:03.396
As a friend.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.836
(WHISPERING)
She said she loves me!

21:19.479 --> 21:22.849
Olive, I have been thinking
of how to ask you this,

21:22.882 --> 21:25.552
and I think
I finally came up
with the perfect way.

21:25.585 --> 21:27.820
So sit back
and listen to this.

21:31.491 --> 21:32.859
* Olive, please date me

21:32.892 --> 21:34.627
* It would be bliss

21:34.661 --> 21:37.364
* Maybe later on your porch
 you and I can... *

21:38.898 --> 21:41.368
Ah! Not again!

21:42.535 --> 21:43.403
Are you still there?

21:44.771 --> 21:46.339
Hello?

21:46.373 --> 21:48.375
I have 47
more verses!

21:48.408 --> 21:53.346
I hired a dancing
John Quincy Adams.

21:53.380 --> 21:54.814
I know he's your
favorite president.

22:02.422 --> 22:03.423
What happened to the music?

22:04.305 --> 22:10.298
