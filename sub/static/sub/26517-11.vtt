WEBVTT

00:05.744 --> 00:07.485
So...

00:07.529 --> 00:10.575
that was quite a night
of babysitting at Darryl's.

00:10.619 --> 00:11.837
Yeah, it was.

00:11.881 --> 00:12.838
And I got to say,

00:12.882 --> 00:14.057
having sex with you while sober?

00:14.101 --> 00:15.754
Delightful.

00:15.798 --> 00:17.669
Yeah. Okay.

00:17.713 --> 00:19.845
Let's get this over with.

00:19.889 --> 00:21.847
What are we doing,
and what do we think this is?

00:21.891 --> 00:23.458
I am actually glad
you mention that,

00:23.501 --> 00:25.808
because I think that
since I'm in recovery

00:25.851 --> 00:28.680
and you're in treatment,
we should really...Take it slow?

00:28.724 --> 00:30.508
I was gonna say that
right off the bat,

00:30.552 --> 00:32.641
but I wanted to take it slow.

00:32.684 --> 00:34.338
And I appreciate that. Sorry.

00:34.382 --> 00:38.777
And... I... appreciate... that.

00:40.431 --> 00:42.390
Okay.Oh, wait.

00:42.433 --> 00:44.870
Should we be
kissing in public?Oh.

00:44.914 --> 00:46.916
No, you're right.
Let me think. Is that wise?

00:46.959 --> 00:50.702
But the more important
question is: Do I care?

00:54.750 --> 00:57.361
Truly don't care.

00:59.755 --> 01:01.148
Ugh.

01:01.191 --> 01:03.280
Leonard, can you believe this?

01:03.324 --> 01:04.325
Look at that guy.

01:04.368 --> 01:06.153
We were gym buddies,

01:06.196 --> 01:08.546
and then I was busy
being a nice person,

01:08.590 --> 01:10.113
and then he jumped in there.

01:10.157 --> 01:12.681
And I mean inthere. Literally.

01:12.724 --> 01:14.248
LEONARD: Dude,
you got to stop

01:14.291 --> 01:15.597
doing this to yourself.

01:15.640 --> 01:17.425
You're turning into
a jilted broken record.

01:17.468 --> 01:19.079
Like her.

01:19.122 --> 01:21.733
Girl, get out from
behind that plant.

01:21.777 --> 01:23.735
Hey.

01:23.779 --> 01:26.260
Hey.Maya has been down here

01:26.303 --> 01:28.697
every day shooting eye
daggers at that girl.

01:28.740 --> 01:30.394
NATHANIEL:
Which girl?

01:30.438 --> 01:32.396
Joanne. Pixie cut.

01:32.440 --> 01:35.138
Coral top that I bought for her.

01:35.182 --> 01:37.836
She works on the second floor
of that insurance agency.

01:37.880 --> 01:39.403
We went out

01:39.447 --> 01:42.798
for two amazing weeks,
and then she ghosted me.

01:43.842 --> 01:45.148
Next thing you know,
she's all over

01:45.192 --> 01:47.019
that hair chewer over there.

01:47.063 --> 01:49.196
"Hi. I'm Marcy,

01:49.239 --> 01:52.068
and I chew my hair,
and I make this face."

01:52.112 --> 01:54.201
"I'm Marcy."

01:54.244 --> 01:55.550
Look at them.

01:55.593 --> 01:57.552
Sitting there just
laughing and laughing

01:57.595 --> 01:59.031
and laughing.

02:01.164 --> 02:02.470
Oh. Greg and Rebecca

02:02.513 --> 02:05.168
are also laughing and laughing.

02:05.212 --> 02:08.476
I didn't know
it was so serious.

02:08.519 --> 02:11.174
What a bummer, dude. Sorry.

02:14.438 --> 02:18.138
NATHANIEL: I can't believe
that she's with him.

02:18.181 --> 02:20.009
It's killing me, George.

02:20.052 --> 02:21.967
I feel so...

02:22.011 --> 02:25.101
rejected and low-status.

02:25.145 --> 02:28.104
I don't like this.
It hurts.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.845
I don't want to feel
like this anymore.

02:29.888 --> 02:31.629
I have to do something, George.

02:31.673 --> 02:33.109
Like what?I don't know. Something...

02:33.153 --> 02:36.112
big and-and emotional

02:36.156 --> 02:38.070
and romantic and fun.

02:38.114 --> 02:40.943
Romantic and fun? You guys
talking about romantic comedies?

02:40.986 --> 02:43.032
You looking for one to
watch? I'm an expert.

02:43.075 --> 02:44.729
Uh...Okay.

02:44.773 --> 02:48.080
To make your selection a little
easier, here are your genres.

02:48.124 --> 02:50.387
You have your
witty British ones,

02:50.431 --> 02:52.041
your workplace
empowerment movies,

02:52.084 --> 02:54.130
your bro-y ones where men wax
things and live on boats...

02:54.174 --> 02:56.176
Eh....and my personal favorite,

02:56.219 --> 02:58.090
the late-middle-aged fantasies
where all the women

02:58.134 --> 03:01.529
wear white cashmere turtlenecks
and have fantastic kitchens.

03:01.572 --> 03:03.226
Huh. I don't think
I've seen any of those.

03:03.270 --> 03:07.230
You've never seen
any romantic comedies?

03:07.274 --> 03:09.580
They're not for me.
I know Rebecca likes them.

03:09.624 --> 03:11.103
Oh, "likes them"?

03:11.147 --> 03:13.410
Uh, she loves them.

03:13.454 --> 03:16.021
: Yeah.
Especially the ones

03:16.065 --> 03:18.285
with some kind of
powerless, nerdy underdog

03:18.328 --> 03:19.721
with a wacky best friend

03:19.764 --> 03:21.549
who feels invisible but
then comes up with a scheme.

03:21.592 --> 03:23.420
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

03:23.464 --> 03:25.248
And then the underdog
makes a big, grand gesture

03:25.292 --> 03:27.555
and wins the person
of their dreams.

03:27.598 --> 03:30.601
Huh. Interesting.

03:35.911 --> 03:38.130
WOMAN :
I don't know what to do.

03:38.174 --> 03:41.351
I'm just ugly, nerdy
and hopelessly in love.

03:41.395 --> 03:43.048
Right there with you, girl.

03:43.092 --> 03:45.268
Don't worry.
It's all gonna end up okay.

03:45.312 --> 03:46.922
You'll get the guy.

03:46.965 --> 03:49.925
That's what always happens.

03:49.968 --> 03:52.971
It always works out.

04:27.354 --> 04:29.965
Oh, I look awful.

04:30.008 --> 04:31.488
I'm atrocious.

04:31.532 --> 04:33.273
Oh, man, I'm a...

04:33.316 --> 04:35.187
I'm a dork.GEORGE:
Hey.

04:35.231 --> 04:38.147
You dumb, ugly,
hopelessly-in-love nerd.

04:38.190 --> 04:41.063
We're late for work.George.

04:41.106 --> 04:42.194
You're my best friend, right?

04:42.238 --> 04:43.457
Hey. Course I am.

04:43.500 --> 04:45.372
I'm your best friend
who loves sports,

04:45.415 --> 04:48.636
and I'm unreasonably cocky
for such a slight man.Right.

04:48.679 --> 04:51.856
Of course you are.
You are you, and I am this.

04:53.118 --> 04:54.772
Oh, we're doing it.

04:54.816 --> 04:56.774
This is amazing.

04:56.818 --> 04:58.254
All right, let's get going.
Come on.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.387
Hot diggity. Basketball!

05:02.519 --> 05:04.695
Okay, we're at work.

05:04.739 --> 05:06.218
What do we do now?

05:06.262 --> 05:07.742
DARRYL:
Hey, guys, good morning.

05:07.785 --> 05:11.702
Ooh, Nathaniel,
looking especially ugly today.

05:11.746 --> 05:13.487
That's right,
I'm the ugly underdog.

05:13.530 --> 05:15.053
PAULA:
Listen up, guys.

05:15.097 --> 05:16.403
He's here.Oh!

05:16.446 --> 05:18.622
Who's here?Everybody,
lace up your bootstraps.

05:19.667 --> 05:21.059
Oh, exciting.

05:40.296 --> 05:42.254
You're here early, sir.

05:42.298 --> 05:43.821
My acupuncturist canceled.

05:43.865 --> 05:45.519
Said something
about a death in the family.

05:45.562 --> 05:46.911
He is fired, of course.

05:46.955 --> 05:48.391
PAULA: Uh, we're working
on the Schiller case,

05:48.435 --> 05:50.350
and the Hellermen clients
will be here at 2:00.

05:50.393 --> 05:52.047
Did you inform them
that we don't do business

05:52.090 --> 05:53.440
with people
who wear cheap suits?

05:53.483 --> 05:56.051
If they show up in off-the-rack
again, they are fired.

05:56.094 --> 05:58.270
Where's my coffee?
I want it scalding.

05:58.314 --> 05:59.663
Where's the Canadian?

05:59.707 --> 06:01.970
Here I am, sir, at your ready!

06:02.013 --> 06:05.103
I want the sixth Girl with the Dragon Tattoo
book.

06:05.147 --> 06:07.932
There's only five
of those books, sir.

06:07.976 --> 06:10.413
Yes, and the
author is dead.

06:10.457 --> 06:11.806
Oh, please send my condolences.

06:11.849 --> 06:13.416
I still want it. Get it.

06:13.460 --> 06:14.548
Everyone.

06:14.591 --> 06:16.506
The big presentation
with the big client

06:16.550 --> 06:18.552
is in 48 hours.

06:18.595 --> 06:20.902
Big client?Our entire reputation

06:20.945 --> 06:24.296
is at stake.
I need two people on this.

06:24.340 --> 06:26.342
Nathaniel.
You'll be point. Maya.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.604
You assist.Yes, sir.

06:27.648 --> 06:29.214
Tim, do you have the book?

06:29.258 --> 06:33.088
Uh, uh...Sir, you just asked him.

06:33.131 --> 06:36.221
I'm so glad
redheads are dying out.

06:36.265 --> 06:39.747
I want it now.
I'll be in my office.

06:40.791 --> 06:42.880
I'm sorry.

06:42.924 --> 06:45.187
You take this folder.
I'll take this folder.

06:45.230 --> 06:47.755
: Oh, George,
this makes sense.

06:48.886 --> 06:50.932
Bert is being
an egregiously mean boss.

06:50.975 --> 06:53.195
There's some sort
of vague presentation.

06:53.238 --> 06:56.416
All I got to do is figure out
the plot, the scheme, the bet,

06:56.459 --> 06:59.157
the gimmick, and what's the
big event with the ticking clock

06:59.201 --> 07:01.638
where I can make
my big, grand gesture?JIM: Guys, guess what.

07:01.682 --> 07:03.292
I got some sizzlin' hot goss.

07:03.335 --> 07:04.467
Greg Serrano's reopening

07:04.511 --> 07:06.295
his dad's old restaurant
in two days.

07:06.338 --> 07:08.253
He is? He just had that idea.

07:08.297 --> 07:10.604
I mean, zoning alone would take
at least three months.Yeah.

07:10.647 --> 07:12.954
I don't know about that stuff,
but rumor is

07:12.997 --> 07:15.217
Greg's gonna ask Rebecca
a big question--

07:15.260 --> 07:17.567
a really big question--
at the grand reopening soiree,

07:17.611 --> 07:19.743
to which we're all invited.
The whole firm.

07:19.787 --> 07:21.615
Oh, George.

07:21.658 --> 07:23.138
This is it.
It's the ideal setting

07:23.181 --> 07:24.487
for our grand gesture.

07:24.531 --> 07:26.533
Now all we got to do
is figure out our scheme.

07:26.576 --> 07:29.013
Let's go down, see Rebecca
and see what our next move is.

07:29.057 --> 07:30.145
That's fine with me.

07:30.188 --> 07:31.451
Only thing I care
about in this world:

07:31.494 --> 07:33.278
sports, your love life.

07:33.322 --> 07:35.629
Now let's go see the
girl you want to get.

07:35.672 --> 07:37.369
Let's do it!Football!

07:42.549 --> 07:44.899
She's unrealistically gorgeous.

07:47.423 --> 07:49.120
And he looks like
a total douche.

07:49.164 --> 07:51.166
Yeah.

07:51.209 --> 07:52.776
This tracks.

07:52.820 --> 07:55.126
What?What?

07:57.172 --> 07:59.043
God. I hate that guy

07:59.087 --> 08:00.958
as if I had a personal
beef with him.

08:01.002 --> 08:02.917
Babe, stop distracting me.
I got to get back to work.

08:02.960 --> 08:05.789
What? Why do you work
in this dump, anyway?

08:05.833 --> 08:07.530
REBECCA:
Because I own it,

08:07.574 --> 08:08.270
silly.

08:08.313 --> 08:09.706
Yeah? Well, I own you.

08:13.754 --> 08:16.191
Oh.Oh. Look.

08:16.234 --> 08:19.063
It's our quirky
but cute coworker

08:19.107 --> 08:21.022
who could be a stunner
if she tried harder.

08:21.065 --> 08:22.066
Hey, Maya!

08:22.110 --> 08:23.067
Oh, no.

08:23.111 --> 08:24.504
My legal books.

08:25.548 --> 08:27.289
Oh, what,

08:27.332 --> 08:29.160
because you're a man,
you think I need your help

08:29.204 --> 08:30.553
carrying my books?

08:30.597 --> 08:32.163
I'll have you know that women

08:32.207 --> 08:34.383
way smaller than me
have been picking up books

08:34.426 --> 08:35.993
way larger than these
for decades.

08:36.037 --> 08:37.691
Decades.

08:37.734 --> 08:39.954
And FYI, I have

08:39.997 --> 08:41.042
opinions and a brain.

08:41.085 --> 08:42.913
I know
that makes me hard to love.

08:42.957 --> 08:45.394
That's why Joanne
chose that simp.

08:45.437 --> 08:46.917
You heard me.

08:46.961 --> 08:48.832
Simp.

08:48.876 --> 08:52.532
Maya? Why are you slinking
around the lobby?

08:52.575 --> 08:54.011
REBECCA: Yeah.
Nathaniel?

08:54.055 --> 08:55.970
What are you doing down here?
And why are you with Maya?

08:56.013 --> 08:58.450
: I mean, God, you
guys have nothing in common.

08:58.494 --> 08:59.800
Seeing the two
of them together,

08:59.843 --> 09:01.323
it's just, like, ridiculous.:
Yeah.

09:02.716 --> 09:03.804
Anyway...

09:05.240 --> 09:07.895
Wait a second. I have an idea.

09:07.938 --> 09:10.201
Just follow my lead, okay?

09:13.683 --> 09:15.903
What?

09:19.123 --> 09:21.822
That's right. We're dating.

09:21.865 --> 09:24.215
Jealous?

09:27.958 --> 09:29.220
Oh, and we're off.

09:35.879 --> 09:37.489
I just can't believe it.

09:37.533 --> 09:39.187
What was that back there?

09:39.230 --> 09:41.972
I mean, who do you
think you are?

09:42.016 --> 09:44.540
You can't just grab me
and kiss me.

09:44.584 --> 09:45.802
What if I did that to you?

09:45.846 --> 09:47.064
I am an opinionated woman,

09:47.108 --> 09:48.675
and I have to call out

09:48.718 --> 09:50.807
the lack of verbal consent.Yeah. I-I know.

09:50.851 --> 09:52.896
And I-I'm sorry,
but I have a good idea.

09:52.940 --> 09:54.985
It's a solid scheme,
and it'll work.

09:55.029 --> 09:56.117
If we pretend
to be together,

09:56.160 --> 09:58.423
Rebecca will realize
she wants me back.

09:58.467 --> 10:00.425
And what's in it for me?

10:00.469 --> 10:02.036
Joanne.

10:02.079 --> 10:04.212
Huh.TIM:
I'm sorry.

10:04.255 --> 10:05.909
I have to go. I'm off
to Sweden to talk

10:05.953 --> 10:07.302
to the estate
of Stieg Larsson to see

10:07.345 --> 10:08.825
if there's an unpublished
manuscript somewhere,

10:08.869 --> 10:10.566
or my head's
on the chopping block.

10:12.350 --> 10:15.702
No, Dad, I-I can't come
to Mom's 70th birthday party.

10:15.745 --> 10:17.878
I'm off to Sweden.
I've been asked to choose

10:17.921 --> 10:19.401
between my relationships
and my career,

10:19.444 --> 10:21.098
and I choose my career.

10:22.143 --> 10:24.406
So, Maya,

10:24.449 --> 10:26.408
are you in?

10:26.451 --> 10:29.454
I mean, it goes against
all of my principles,

10:29.498 --> 10:33.154
of which there are many,
but it just might work.

10:34.416 --> 10:35.199
What do we do next?

10:35.243 --> 10:36.548
Well, I'm not totally sure.

10:36.592 --> 10:38.376
I think we'll find out
in a few seconds, though.

10:38.420 --> 10:40.161
That seems to be the pattern.

10:40.204 --> 10:42.642
Guys, where have you been?
What are you doing?

10:42.685 --> 10:45.122
Bert is all wound up. He says
you're supposed to be working

10:45.166 --> 10:47.211
on the big presentation
for the big client.

10:47.255 --> 10:48.604
So why aren't you doing it?

10:48.648 --> 10:50.519
Why do you
care so much?

10:50.562 --> 10:52.042
Because it's big.

10:52.086 --> 10:54.654
Now, get to work.

11:05.665 --> 11:06.796
You know what,
Paula is right.

11:06.840 --> 11:08.537
We should focus
on this big presentation.

11:08.580 --> 11:10.713
No, no, no. We need
to work on our scheme.

11:10.757 --> 11:12.062
We haven't
even opened the file.

11:12.106 --> 11:14.456
We don't even know
who the client is.

11:14.499 --> 11:15.936
Oh, who cares
about the client?

11:15.979 --> 11:18.547
Do you want to work, or do
you want to fall in love?

11:18.590 --> 11:22.290
My dead mother always told me
that I could do both.

11:23.334 --> 11:24.553
Okay, sure.

11:24.596 --> 11:26.729
But right now
we need to do something big

11:26.773 --> 11:28.949
to get Rebecca
and Joanne's attention.

11:28.992 --> 11:30.951
But how? How do we do that?

11:30.994 --> 11:33.954
How are we ever gonna get them
in the same room together

11:33.997 --> 11:36.304
so we can flaunt our fake love?

11:36.347 --> 11:38.306
Who's coming
to building karaoke?

11:38.349 --> 11:39.699
That's right.

11:39.742 --> 11:41.004
I said "building."

11:41.048 --> 11:42.440
The company
that owns our building

11:42.484 --> 11:45.008
is having a karaoke night
and inviting MountainTop

11:45.052 --> 11:46.749
and the insurance company
from floor two

11:46.793 --> 11:49.056
and everyone from Rebetzel's,
obviously.

11:49.099 --> 11:51.275
Whoa.Wait, building karaoke?

11:51.319 --> 11:52.363
That's perfect.

11:52.407 --> 11:54.235
That's where we
can flaunt our love,

11:54.278 --> 11:55.802
with a sexy love duet

11:55.845 --> 11:58.761
that'll make Rebecca and Joanne
seethe with jealousy.

11:58.805 --> 12:00.502
Jim, when is it?Well, even though

12:00.545 --> 12:02.591
a party like that might take
a while to plan and execute,

12:02.634 --> 12:03.940
it's tonight!

12:03.984 --> 12:05.855
Tonight? Oh,
this is it, Maya.

12:05.899 --> 12:07.770
This is how we win them back.

12:07.814 --> 12:09.467
There's just one problem.

12:10.599 --> 12:12.470
We're uggos. We're trag'.

12:12.514 --> 12:13.863
We're-we're before pictures.

12:13.907 --> 12:15.473
We're basically invisible.Wait.

12:15.517 --> 12:16.866
What? Excuse me?

12:16.910 --> 12:18.172
Wh...

12:18.215 --> 12:20.827
We need makeovers.Speak for yourself.

12:20.870 --> 12:22.263
I like my sensible

12:22.306 --> 12:25.179
and quirky clothing
which expresses my individuality

12:25.222 --> 12:27.094
and feisty progressiveness.

12:27.137 --> 12:28.791

is right now!

Yes, you can't miss your chance
to make Rebecca jealous,

14:31.392 --> 14:32.872

really,

can we please get back
to the big presentation?

I beg you. My God!

to calm down.

16:31.555 --> 16:33.601

Maya was his type.

Good, because,

16:43.219 --> 16:44.699
if you were jealous,
we'd have a problem.

16:44.742 --> 16:47.484
Babe, you're so funny.

16:49.530 --> 16:51.488
So, who's up next?
Any duets?

It's dark all the time.

20:54.688 --> 20:57.125
And I could not get the book.

20:57.168 --> 20:58.126
But I can secure

20:58.169 --> 20:59.693
a very nice first edition

20:59.736 --> 21:01.564
of Goodnight Moon.

21:01.608 --> 21:04.524
Goodnight Moon?
Good night, Tim.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.529
Dad, I'm sorry
I missed your operation.

21:09.572 --> 21:11.182
I'm coming home.

21:12.662 --> 21:14.490
It didn't work.

21:14.534 --> 21:16.579
Rebecca and Joanne
walked out.

21:16.623 --> 21:18.277
But we don't know why they left.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.801
Maybe they left
because they were so jealous.

21:20.844 --> 21:22.411
Well, did she call you?

21:22.455 --> 21:24.500
Did she say she's made a big
mistake and run into your arms?

21:24.544 --> 21:26.763
No, but...Well, neither did Joanne.

21:26.807 --> 21:29.113
I can't do this anymore.No.

21:29.157 --> 21:31.202
You can't quit, Maya.
We can do this.

21:31.246 --> 21:33.335
I can't take this anymore.

21:33.379 --> 21:35.511
This isn't the kind
of girl I am.

21:35.555 --> 21:37.383
I have dreams.

21:37.426 --> 21:39.559
My dead mom, before she died,

21:39.602 --> 21:42.692
told my single dad
that I should pursue my dreams.

21:42.736 --> 21:44.694
I'm a visual artist.

21:44.738 --> 21:46.783
I make found object collages.

21:46.827 --> 21:50.004
I use driftwood and
plastic cutlery and doll parts,

21:50.047 --> 21:53.224
but you don't get it,
because you don't get me!

21:53.268 --> 21:55.401
Art? Why are you talking
about your stupid art?

21:55.444 --> 21:57.403
I'm sorry.

21:57.446 --> 21:58.665
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

21:58.708 --> 21:59.970
I just... I just...Yes,

22:00.014 --> 22:01.668
you did.

22:03.060 --> 22:04.975
Maya?

22:16.683 --> 22:18.685
NATHANIEL:
She was so mad at me.

22:18.728 --> 22:20.643
That's okay,
though, right?

22:20.687 --> 22:23.733
Who cares what
Maya thinks?

22:23.777 --> 22:25.822
You're not actually
in love with Maya.

22:25.866 --> 22:28.434
You're in love
with Rebecca.

22:28.477 --> 22:30.087
I know that.

22:30.131 --> 22:32.394
You don't think I know that?

22:32.438 --> 22:35.528
I'm just so glad I don't have
to spend time with her anymore.

22:35.571 --> 22:37.747
With her strong opinions
and her weird art

22:37.791 --> 22:40.228
and her sad mom backstory.

22:40.271 --> 22:41.621
What?!

22:41.664 --> 22:43.362
You're not making any sense
anymore.

22:43.405 --> 22:45.015
Also, you do still have
to spend time with her.

22:45.059 --> 22:47.453
You guys have to finish
the big presentation together.

22:47.496 --> 22:51.282
And move into tree pose
at your own pace.

22:51.326 --> 22:55.374
GEORGE:
Bert definitely said
both of you or nothing.

22:55.417 --> 22:57.680
I can't do it, George.

22:57.724 --> 22:59.421
I can't be around Maya.

22:59.465 --> 23:01.423
None of this is going
according to plan.

23:01.467 --> 23:04.208
What plan?I don't know.
I don't know what happens next.

23:04.252 --> 23:06.428
I only watched the first hour
of those dumb movies,

23:06.472 --> 23:09.170
and then the tone changes,
and it gets kind of serious,

23:09.213 --> 23:10.432
and it rains.

23:11.738 --> 23:13.696
MAYA:
Okay, Nathaniel...

23:13.740 --> 23:16.569
let's do this
and be done with it

23:16.612 --> 23:18.701
and not talk
about anything else.

23:18.745 --> 23:21.835
Fine... with... me.

23:21.878 --> 23:24.228
We put this off long enough.

23:25.665 --> 23:27.057
Oh, my God.

23:27.101 --> 23:28.798
What?

23:28.842 --> 23:31.845
Look who the client is
for the big case.

23:33.716 --> 23:35.501
Joanne's insurance company?

23:38.025 --> 23:40.244
Joanne is the client?

23:40.288 --> 23:41.855
That is gonna suck.

23:41.898 --> 23:44.292
I really don't want to see her.

23:45.511 --> 23:47.513
Yeah, you do.

23:49.166 --> 23:50.516
You do want to see her.

23:50.559 --> 23:52.256
Wait a minute.
I have an idea.

23:52.300 --> 23:54.302
Another one?Yeah.

23:54.345 --> 23:55.782
Instead of me
presenting the argument

23:55.825 --> 23:57.348
for the big client,
you'll do it.

23:57.392 --> 23:59.481
And you'll be so
smart, so persuasive

23:59.525 --> 24:03.354
and look so gorgeous that she'll
drop Marcy like a hot rock.

24:03.398 --> 24:05.095
This is your grand gesture.

24:05.139 --> 24:06.662
You get one, too.

24:06.706 --> 24:08.969
Whoa.

24:09.012 --> 24:11.058
That could work.

24:11.101 --> 24:12.668
And wait.
I have an idea, too.

24:12.712 --> 24:14.931
It goes with your idea.

24:14.975 --> 24:17.325
If you help me
with the presentation,

24:17.368 --> 24:19.240
I'll help you
with the speech you'll give

24:19.283 --> 24:21.024
at the grand opening
of Greg's restaurant,

24:21.068 --> 24:22.243
which we heard about before,

24:22.286 --> 24:24.288
but then we kind of
forgot about it.

24:24.332 --> 24:26.465
Oh, yeah, it's still happening.

24:26.508 --> 24:27.683
He said Greg
is gonna ask Rebecca

24:27.727 --> 24:29.380
some kind of
a big question.

24:29.424 --> 24:30.556
That means a proposal.

24:30.599 --> 24:32.427
But before that happens,

24:32.471 --> 24:34.908
you will stand up and give
the most amazing speech,

24:34.951 --> 24:36.953
telling Rebecca how you feel.

24:36.997 --> 24:38.346
That's a great idea.

24:38.389 --> 24:40.087
Come on, we can do this.

24:40.130 --> 24:43.351
We don't have a lot
of time left, though.I know.

24:43.394 --> 24:45.266
The big presentation
is tomorrow afternoon.

24:45.309 --> 24:48.095
And the Serrano's opening
is tomorrow night.

24:48.138 --> 24:49.313
We got to get to work.

24:49.357 --> 24:50.924
Come on.

24:50.967 --> 24:54.231
All right.
No one's done the, uh...

24:54.275 --> 24:56.190
I saw the billing codes
in here somewhere,

24:56.233 --> 24:58.497
and I can't find them.Page 39.

24:58.540 --> 25:00.716
Thank you. And I'm just
gonna cross... actually just

25:00.760 --> 25:03.327
cross this out.♪ Do, do-do-do, do...

25:03.371 --> 25:05.068
Okay, and relax.
Here, have some coffee.

25:05.939 --> 25:07.288
And then carry the four.

25:07.331 --> 25:08.507
♪ Do, do-do-do, do-do...

25:08.550 --> 25:10.160
MAYA:
Then we have Rebecca.

25:10.204 --> 25:12.293
Yes.Who likes pretzels?

25:12.336 --> 25:14.034
Yeah, I like pretzels.You like pretzels.

25:14.077 --> 25:15.209
Yes!

25:15.252 --> 25:17.428
Abatement of nuisance.
Is that Marcy?
Yes!

25:21.694 --> 25:22.956
I never had a real Mom.

25:22.999 --> 25:24.174
Yeah.Just a dead mom.

25:24.218 --> 25:25.524
What?We have to do these!

25:25.567 --> 25:27.438
No, no. I never do them.It's a tradition.

25:27.482 --> 25:30.572
Oh. We got the same fortune.Oh, my God!

25:32.139 --> 25:33.532
That's the right move.

25:35.577 --> 25:37.361
"Can I speak to a manager?"

25:37.405 --> 25:39.842
Then she said,
"I am the manager."

25:39.886 --> 25:41.452
Oh, that's the worst.I was so embarrassed.

25:41.496 --> 25:42.628
Oh, God.

25:42.671 --> 25:45.892
Said, "I don't want
to be your dog anymore."

25:45.935 --> 25:49.417
Let it out.
Let it out.

25:50.766 --> 25:51.898
Ooh, that'll work.

25:51.941 --> 25:53.595
Absolutely.

25:53.639 --> 25:55.118
Write that down.
Write it down.

25:55.162 --> 25:56.859
Write that down.

25:56.903 --> 25:58.731
♪ Do, do-do, do-do-do.

26:38.901 --> 26:40.511
Let's go, people.
Hustle up.

26:40.555 --> 26:42.339
It's time
for the big presentation.

26:59.008 --> 27:02.664
Here you are, sir--
the sixth book in the series.

27:02.708 --> 27:05.624
It's called The Girl with the Face Full of Fire.

27:05.667 --> 27:07.974
It's about adult cystic acne.

27:08.017 --> 27:09.410
How did you...?I was about to give up,

27:09.453 --> 27:11.412
but at the last minute,
I ran into a Swedish friend

27:11.455 --> 27:13.109
who translates the books
into English,

27:13.153 --> 27:14.458
and he told me that

27:14.502 --> 27:15.590
the original author died

27:15.634 --> 27:16.983
after writing
the first three books,

27:17.026 --> 27:19.202
and another writer
wrote the next two books,

27:19.246 --> 27:20.856
and there is
a new manuscript.

27:20.900 --> 27:22.945
And voilà.

27:22.989 --> 27:26.253
Or, as the Swedes like to say,
"Varsagod."

27:26.296 --> 27:28.298
Hmm. Hmm.

27:32.259 --> 27:33.390
Welcome to MountainTop.

27:33.434 --> 27:34.609
Thank you.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.132
I'm Paula Proctor.

27:36.176 --> 27:37.699
Hey.

27:37.743 --> 27:39.353
You can do this.

27:39.396 --> 27:41.529
You really think so?

27:41.572 --> 27:43.400
I know you can.

27:43.444 --> 27:46.316
Just do it like we practiced.

27:47.361 --> 27:48.710
Okay.

27:48.754 --> 27:50.016
Welcome.Nice to see you.

27:50.059 --> 27:51.147
Have a seat
right there.

27:52.279 --> 27:54.150
Okay, I'd like to hear this

27:54.194 --> 27:55.717
big presentation.

28:02.158 --> 28:05.509
Our proposal
for your insurance company

28:05.553 --> 28:08.208
has four parts to it.

28:08.251 --> 28:12.429
Um, part one--
transfer of ownership.

28:12.473 --> 28:15.258
A multiplatform

28:15.302 --> 28:17.260
transfer of ownership...

28:28.968 --> 28:31.274
Tree frogs.

28:35.148 --> 28:37.324
Compliance.

28:38.325 --> 28:40.153
Real estate.

28:40.196 --> 28:41.632
The environment.

28:43.765 --> 28:47.290
And there we come to part four.

28:49.292 --> 28:51.425
Zoning.

28:51.468 --> 28:53.470
Oh, excellent!

28:59.389 --> 29:01.261
PAULA:
Thank God.

29:01.304 --> 29:04.568
The big presentation for
the big case. We did it!

29:04.612 --> 29:08.442
It's all I cared about,
and it happened.

29:10.400 --> 29:14.361
What do I do now?
What's my purpose?

29:16.450 --> 29:19.975
Wow. Maya, I had no idea
you were so wise

29:20.019 --> 29:21.847
and smart and poised.

29:21.890 --> 29:23.196
What a great speech.

29:23.239 --> 29:24.632
Thanks.

29:24.675 --> 29:27.026
I had a little help.

29:28.331 --> 29:31.378
Maybe I never should have
let you go.

29:31.421 --> 29:32.727
Really?

29:32.771 --> 29:35.121
Would you like to go talk
about your proposal more

29:35.164 --> 29:37.036
at the wine bar
over on Foothill?

29:37.079 --> 29:38.472
Um, sure, yeah.

29:38.515 --> 29:41.170
But what about Marcy?

29:41.214 --> 29:42.781
That hair chewer?

29:42.824 --> 29:44.826
I already dumped
that piece of trash.

29:44.870 --> 29:46.741
Texted her while
you were talking.

29:46.785 --> 29:49.178
MAYA:
Wow. Really?

29:49.222 --> 29:52.399
That is so sweet.

29:56.533 --> 29:57.839
Let me grab my stuff.

29:57.883 --> 29:59.232
You did it!

29:59.275 --> 30:00.407
Because of you.

30:00.450 --> 30:01.712
Oh.

30:01.756 --> 30:03.279
Now, get to that
Serrano's opening

30:03.323 --> 30:05.760
and win back the
girl you love.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.240
The girl I love.

30:07.283 --> 30:08.850
Yeah. Sure.

30:08.894 --> 30:11.287
You're gonna do great.

30:11.331 --> 30:12.636
You're gonna break
up Greg's proposal

30:12.680 --> 30:14.943
and have Rebecca in
your arms in no time.

30:16.292 --> 30:17.511
Well...

30:17.554 --> 30:19.121
I'd better go.

30:19.165 --> 30:21.471
Yeah. No, yeah,
you-you should go.

30:21.515 --> 30:24.126
This has been...

30:24.170 --> 30:27.216
Yeah, yeah. No, I-I know.

30:27.260 --> 30:28.522
I wish you...

30:28.565 --> 30:30.089
Yeah.

30:30.132 --> 30:32.569
I just want you
to know that...

30:32.613 --> 30:34.658
I know it.

30:40.142 --> 30:42.536
Ready, babe?Yeah.

30:52.981 --> 30:56.202
GREG: Hey, guys, uh, could you
quiet down for a second?

30:56.245 --> 30:58.073
I'd just like to say
a little something.

30:58.117 --> 30:59.683
Thank you,
sweetheart. Um...

30:59.727 --> 31:01.163
What?

31:01.207 --> 31:03.078
Please make
sure you try

31:03.122 --> 31:04.558
the garlic bread--
we fly it specially in

31:04.601 --> 31:06.429
from Brooklyn.
Have a good night.

31:06.473 --> 31:08.083
Salud.

31:10.259 --> 31:12.696
Well, this is it, champ.

31:12.740 --> 31:15.264
You helped Maya get
the girl, and it worked,

31:15.308 --> 31:19.225
and now it's time for
your grand gesture.

31:19.268 --> 31:20.879
Do you think it'll work?

31:20.922 --> 31:24.099
I mean, she wasn't even jealous
when Maya and I sang karaoke.

31:24.143 --> 31:26.275
What? You got the
wrong information.

31:26.319 --> 31:27.973
Thank God I'm
here. Whew!

31:28.016 --> 31:30.584
Here's the deal. I saw Rebecca
that night at building karaoke.

31:30.627 --> 31:31.890
She was jealous as hell.

31:31.933 --> 31:33.282
That's why she
got out of there.

31:33.326 --> 31:34.980
She was stuttering
and stammering,

31:35.023 --> 31:37.286
trying to cover that
jealousy, but I saw it.

31:37.330 --> 31:39.158
Hmm. Well, do you think...

31:39.201 --> 31:42.030
Nathaniel.
Did you hear that?

31:42.074 --> 31:44.641
You are there.
You're almost in.

31:44.685 --> 31:48.428
Okay. So... so, when should I
give the big speech?

32:03.008 --> 32:04.357
Now.

32:04.400 --> 32:06.576
Now. Do it now!Okay, all right.

32:06.620 --> 32:08.709
Uh, hello, everybody.

32:08.752 --> 32:12.843
Um, I'm Nathaniel Plimpton III,

32:12.887 --> 32:14.193
and, um...

32:14.236 --> 32:16.499
I, uh...

32:16.543 --> 32:19.981
well, I was gonna... I was gonna
make a speech here tonight,

32:20.025 --> 32:22.114
and I had a, uh...

32:22.157 --> 32:24.203
gesture planned--
hence the string quartet--

32:24.246 --> 32:27.989
um... but, um...

32:28.033 --> 32:30.644
Huh. I...

32:54.668 --> 32:57.018
I don't want to say it anymore.

32:58.715 --> 33:01.588
Not here, anyway.
Um, I'm sorry, I, uh...

33:01.631 --> 33:03.894
I have to go.
I, uh...

33:03.938 --> 33:05.418
I have to go.

33:05.461 --> 33:06.941
Come on, guys.

33:14.731 --> 33:17.299
Hockey!

33:27.483 --> 33:30.269
That makes me
so frustrated.

33:30.312 --> 33:31.444
I know.

33:31.487 --> 33:33.489
Maya.

33:33.533 --> 33:35.404
Nathaniel, what's wrong?

33:35.448 --> 33:36.492
I have something to tell you.

33:36.536 --> 33:38.364
Okay.
It's you.

33:38.407 --> 33:40.148
It's always been you.
I was a fool.

33:40.192 --> 33:42.759
I couldn't see, but you've
been here all along.

33:42.803 --> 33:43.891
Look...Nathaniel, wait.

33:43.934 --> 33:45.066
Just listen to me.

33:46.154 --> 33:48.069
I'm not the person
I used to be.

33:48.113 --> 33:51.246
You've changed my whole life:
who I am, who I can be.

33:51.290 --> 33:54.162
Sure, we're an
unexpected couple.

33:54.206 --> 33:55.816
You're short, I'm tall.

33:55.859 --> 33:57.905
You're quirky,
I'm really not.

33:57.948 --> 34:00.038
I know the world thinks
people like us

34:00.081 --> 34:02.083
shouldn't be together,
that we don't belong together,

34:02.127 --> 34:03.476
but we do.

34:03.519 --> 34:06.392
We're that mismatched couple
from different worlds

34:06.435 --> 34:08.916
that can make it.

34:08.959 --> 34:12.354
We've had such happy moments,
you and I, haven't we?

34:12.398 --> 34:14.530
Yeah, we have.

34:14.574 --> 34:17.359
What we had was
wonderful and fun.

34:17.403 --> 34:19.231
We had chemistry, lots of it.

34:19.274 --> 34:22.321
And I really thought
this could be something.

34:22.364 --> 34:24.497
I thought I really loved you.

34:25.715 --> 34:28.327
The sex was amazing.

34:30.329 --> 34:31.982
What?
Yeah.

34:32.026 --> 34:34.376
Ever since we had
our first kiss in the elevator,

34:34.420 --> 34:36.509
our chemistry has been...

34:36.552 --> 34:37.684
We never kissed in the elevator.

34:37.727 --> 34:38.859
We-we never had...

34:38.902 --> 34:42.297
But I'm back with my ex now.

34:42.341 --> 34:45.344
Someone I have a chance
at being truly happy with.

34:45.387 --> 34:48.608
Please, let me be happy.

34:48.651 --> 34:51.480
Happy, happy, happy, happy...

34:51.524 --> 34:56.485
Please, let me be happy.

34:56.529 --> 34:59.662
Well, I want you
to be happy. I do.

34:59.706 --> 35:02.056
If you really love me,

35:02.100 --> 35:04.319
you have to let me go.

35:04.363 --> 35:06.495
Please.

35:07.540 --> 35:09.542
God, really?

35:10.586 --> 35:12.762
Yeah.

35:15.069 --> 35:18.464
And deep down,
you know it's true.

35:18.507 --> 35:22.337
You need to move on from me.

35:22.381 --> 35:26.254
To another short, quirky girl,

35:26.298 --> 35:27.821
or to someone else.

35:27.864 --> 35:30.345
What? No.

35:30.389 --> 35:32.347
No!

35:32.391 --> 35:35.263
No! No.

35:37.744 --> 35:39.963
Damn it.
Yeah, who is it?

35:40.007 --> 35:41.400
MAN:
It's your pizza.

35:45.186 --> 35:47.101
Hi. Uh, gluten-free,
dairy-free...

35:47.145 --> 35:48.711
Yeah, that's me. You can
just put it right there.

35:50.583 --> 35:52.759
Hey, can I ask you something?Okay.

35:53.847 --> 35:56.893
She's, um... she's
happy without me.

35:58.460 --> 36:00.158
How do I let her go?

36:01.594 --> 36:03.552
Do you know how
I can let her go?

36:05.163 --> 36:06.599
Oh.

36:12.257 --> 36:13.997
It's okay. It's all right.

36:16.870 --> 36:18.872
Okay, I-I should go.

36:18.915 --> 36:21.918
Yeah, sorry.
I'm sorry.

36:21.962 --> 36:23.529
Thanks.
Thank you.

36:23.572 --> 36:25.052
Yeah. You can stay
if you want.

36:25.095 --> 36:27.228
No. You feel better.All right.

36:40.154 --> 36:41.242
Hey, Maya.
Hi.

36:41.286 --> 36:44.202
Listen, you can do better
than Joanne.

36:44.245 --> 36:47.292
She doesn't understand
good karaoke,

36:47.335 --> 36:50.556
and she dumped Marcy
during a meeting.

36:50.599 --> 36:51.818
What?
Also,

36:51.861 --> 36:54.690
you look great
in magenta dresses.

36:54.734 --> 36:56.388
Not approp', dude.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.002
Don't do that.

37:02.045 --> 37:03.612
Hey.
Hey.

37:03.656 --> 37:06.572
Um, I have something
I want to tell you.
Oh, good.

37:06.615 --> 37:09.531
I, uh... I actually have
something to tell you, too.Oh.

37:09.575 --> 37:11.751
Can I go first, actually?

37:11.794 --> 37:13.927
Yeah.
Okay, um...

37:13.970 --> 37:16.190
Greg and I are...

37:16.234 --> 37:18.975
You're together.
I know.

37:19.019 --> 37:21.456
Oh...
I'm sorry.

37:21.500 --> 37:24.677
No, no, no.
It's okay, it's okay.

37:24.720 --> 37:27.897
You're happy.
I know that now.

37:27.941 --> 37:29.508
I learned that.

37:31.205 --> 37:33.990
When did you learn that?

37:34.034 --> 37:36.950
Well, I had this weird

37:36.993 --> 37:40.780
fantasy daydream... thing.

37:40.823 --> 37:44.566
It's hard to explain,
but it's like I...

37:44.610 --> 37:47.830
I imagined myself in
a... in a recognizable

37:47.874 --> 37:50.006
pop-culture genre.

37:50.050 --> 37:52.008
What?
Yeah, yeah.

37:52.052 --> 37:54.010
It's like I was
trying out a persona

37:54.054 --> 37:57.100
to try and figure out
something in my life.

37:59.233 --> 38:01.148
Go on.
Well, while I was
doing that,

38:01.191 --> 38:05.892
I-I realized something that
I hadn't realized before,

38:05.935 --> 38:09.461
and I-I learned
something from it.

38:09.504 --> 38:11.854
Yeah, I can relate.

38:11.898 --> 38:13.813
You can?
Yeah.

38:13.856 --> 38:17.033
Huh. So, what did you learn?

38:17.077 --> 38:20.298
Something I really
didn't want to know.

38:21.951 --> 38:25.085
I got to let you go.

38:27.479 --> 38:31.004
Because you're happy, right?

38:31.047 --> 38:32.222
You're happy with Greg?

38:32.266 --> 38:36.792
I mean... I-I don't know.

38:36.836 --> 38:39.360
I'm not there yet, but...

38:39.404 --> 38:41.928
I could possibly be, yeah.

38:41.971 --> 38:43.669
Well, he's a good guy.

38:43.712 --> 38:45.366
He really is.
He's a great guy.

38:45.410 --> 38:48.064
He's not some jerk
who wears blazers

38:48.108 --> 38:50.893
and a sweater, or
sometimes two sweaters.

38:53.026 --> 38:56.508
Yeah, I mean, it's California,
so that'd be a lot.

38:59.293 --> 39:01.164
Well, I'm-I'm glad
you're happy.

39:01.208 --> 39:02.992
I really am.

39:03.036 --> 39:05.560
And it makes me happy, too.

39:05.604 --> 39:07.214
It does.

39:07.257 --> 39:11.740
Wow. Thank you.

39:11.784 --> 39:13.960
I got to get back
to work now, so...

39:14.003 --> 39:14.961
So do I.

39:15.004 --> 39:17.442
I'll see you.Yeah.

39:25.667 --> 39:27.582
Hey.
Hey.

39:27.626 --> 39:30.933
I stopped by to say hi.
I missed you.

39:30.977 --> 39:33.458
What? We just hung out
like an hour ago.

39:33.501 --> 39:36.591
Well, exactly.

39:36.635 --> 39:38.941
Hey.
Hmm?

39:38.985 --> 39:41.944
You want to kiss in public?

39:41.988 --> 39:44.207
Absolutely.

40:00.528 --> 40:03.139
Get my steak ready,
Emily Blunt.
