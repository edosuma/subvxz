00:12.968 --> 00:14.469
Sweet wheels.

00:14.536 --> 00:15.470
Right back at you, dawg.

00:16.639 --> 00:19.407
Love the smell of

00:19.475 --> 00:21.175
day before Christmas
in the morning.

00:21.243 --> 00:23.311
There's just nothing
quite like the sweet scent

00:23.379 --> 00:25.380
of desperate last-minute
shoppers in the air.

00:25.447 --> 00:26.748
You jack our prices up 10%?

00:26.815 --> 00:28.007
15.
You snooze, you lose.

00:28.083 --> 00:29.350
We're going to rob them blind.

00:29.418 --> 00:31.019
Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

00:46.502 --> 00:49.003
Hey, sure is quiet around here.

00:49.071 --> 00:50.939
Bad guys taking
a holiday too?

00:51.006 --> 00:53.841
Not that I mind, by the way,
because the Intersect

00:53.909 --> 00:56.344
could certainly use
some down time as well.

00:56.412 --> 00:58.146
Speaking of which, we have
a cover date tomorrow.

00:58.213 --> 00:59.647
Christmas at the Bartowskis.

00:59.715 --> 01:02.083
Oh, uh, thanks
for the invitation, Chuck,

01:02.151 --> 01:03.584
but I don't do Christmas.

01:05.453 --> 01:07.055
I'm sorry.

01:07.122 --> 01:09.357
I think you just said
you don't do Christmas?

01:09.425 --> 01:11.793
Look, I would rather
not get into it.

01:11.860 --> 01:13.928
But it-it's Christmas!

01:13.996 --> 01:15.964
Look, I'm not buying
the whole Scrooge act, okay.

01:16.031 --> 01:17.732
Underneath
that spy cover

01:17.800 --> 01:19.867
is a regular person
just like the rest of us.

01:19.935 --> 01:21.069
I mean, honestly, how weird

01:21.136 --> 01:22.403
could Christmas
have been for you?

01:22.471 --> 01:24.706
Christmas
at the Burton household

01:24.773 --> 01:28.142
meant the annual
Salvation Army con job.

01:28.210 --> 01:30.044
Okay, well, it's, uh...

01:30.112 --> 01:31.746
okay, you're a little
different than the rest of us.

01:31.814 --> 01:34.315
But Christmas at
the Bartowskis means

01:34.383 --> 01:36.818
eggnog, PJs,

01:36.885 --> 01:39.387
a fake gas
fireplace

01:39.455 --> 01:42.156
and that's right--
<i>Twilight Zone</i> marathons.

01:42.224 --> 01:45.526
I'm not taking no for an answer,
Walker, so prepare

01:45.594 --> 01:47.528
to be heart-warmed.

01:52.334 --> 01:54.902
Oh, thank God you're here,
Chuck, thank God.

01:54.970 --> 01:56.771
Anna won't speak to me,
you know, after I balked

01:56.839 --> 01:58.206
at the whole moving in
together thing.

01:58.273 --> 02:00.408
She thinks you're immature.

02:00.476 --> 02:02.110
Afraid to grow up
and be an adult.

02:02.177 --> 02:04.712
Exactly. Yeah, exactly,
and that's ridiculous!

02:04.780 --> 02:07.582
Do I not look like
an adult to you?

02:19.361 --> 02:20.995
Well, it's been
about a half hour now,

02:21.063 --> 02:22.563
and the chase continues
through the Valley.

02:22.631 --> 02:24.132
20 large says this
thing ends with the pigs

02:24.199 --> 02:25.733
making that punk eat lead.
Thoughts?

02:25.801 --> 02:27.201
I say he crashes

02:27.269 --> 02:28.202
and we end up
with a stand-off,

02:28.270 --> 02:29.303
maybe hostages.

02:29.371 --> 02:30.371
Never going to happen.

02:30.439 --> 02:31.672
Please, you guys
are amateurs.

02:31.740 --> 02:33.608
This has "beatdown"
written all over it.

02:33.675 --> 02:36.110
Okay, bring it in then.
Bring it in, everybody. Bring it in.

02:36.178 --> 02:38.913
Well, it's nice to see everyone's
in the Christmas spirit this morning.

02:38.981 --> 02:40.348
This is how we roll...
- Bartowski!

02:40.416 --> 02:42.383
Door's open in an hour.

02:42.451 --> 02:43.785
Round up the freaks,
have everyone meet me

02:43.852 --> 02:45.353
at Santa's village.
Pronto!

02:57.266 --> 02:58.766
This is it, people.

02:58.834 --> 03:00.768
D-day.

03:00.836 --> 03:01.903
You ready for war?

03:03.739 --> 03:04.806
You got what it takes?!

03:06.375 --> 03:08.176
Take a sniff, Grimes!

03:08.243 --> 03:09.977
Tell this band of misfits
what you smell.

03:10.045 --> 03:12.313
Absolutely, uh, coffee?
Hazelnut, maybe?

03:12.381 --> 03:14.148
A... glazed bear claw,

03:14.216 --> 03:15.450
cream-filled
perhaps, sir?

03:15.517 --> 03:16.951
I'm not talking
about my breakfast!

03:18.120 --> 03:19.620
I'm talking about profits!

03:19.688 --> 03:21.055
People are lazy.

03:21.123 --> 03:23.424
They'll be looking to purchase
last-minute gifts

03:23.492 --> 03:28.229
which is why we raised
our prices 15%.

03:28.297 --> 03:30.231
We're looking at
a record sales day,

03:30.299 --> 03:33.634
long as you people
don't screw it up.

03:33.702 --> 03:36.204
So, don't!

03:42.311 --> 03:43.945
Hey, thank you.

03:44.012 --> 03:45.446
Hey, what's going on?

03:45.514 --> 03:46.948
We, uh, we decided
we'd beat the rush

03:47.015 --> 03:49.050
and take advantage of the
friends and family discount.

03:49.118 --> 03:50.184
Oh, don't worry about
getting me a gift, babe.

03:50.252 --> 03:51.152
You already did.

03:51.220 --> 03:52.286
I did?

03:52.354 --> 03:53.821
Yeah, I took it upon myself

03:53.889 --> 03:55.056
since you never know
what to get me.

03:55.124 --> 03:56.724
Well, that's great.
What'd I get you?

03:56.792 --> 03:59.427
Weekend sky diving trip
with the boys in Crested Butte.

03:59.495 --> 04:01.562
10,000 foot free-fall.
- Awesome!

04:01.630 --> 04:02.964
Bartowski! Santa's Village.

04:03.031 --> 04:04.632
Uh, yeah.
Hey, great.

04:04.700 --> 04:06.801
I got to get back to work.
You kids have fun.

04:06.869 --> 04:09.070
Great, so, um,
my gift to my fiancé

04:09.138 --> 04:10.304
is a ticket to death.

04:10.372 --> 04:11.572
Babe, it's completely safe.

04:11.640 --> 04:14.208
Besides, I need
the adrenaline rush,

04:14.276 --> 04:15.610
a little sense of danger
in my life.

04:17.279 --> 04:19.079
What?

04:19.148 --> 04:21.349
Okay, the suspect has just
gotten off the 5 Freeway

04:21.416 --> 04:23.184
and right now is making his way
through Burbank.

04:23.252 --> 04:25.386
Oh, man.
The cops looked pissed!

04:25.454 --> 04:27.455
I'm so winning the pool.

04:27.523 --> 04:29.090
Christmas sucks.

04:29.158 --> 04:30.591
Action News reporting,

04:30.659 --> 04:32.627
as police continue
their high-speed chase

04:32.694 --> 04:35.863
through downtown Burbank.

04:35.931 --> 04:37.632
If anything, he appears to be

04:37.699 --> 04:39.333
picking up speed in this
residential neighborhood.

04:39.401 --> 04:42.069
Now, folks, we'd like
to warn anyone in the area

04:42.137 --> 04:44.539
this is obviously an
extremely dangerous situation.

04:44.606 --> 04:47.074
Wait a minute; it appears the
perpetrator has just...

04:47.142 --> 04:48.476
turned off Burbank Boulevard
into a shopping complex.

04:50.312 --> 04:51.345
He's not slowing down.
He's not slowing down!

05:01.123 --> 05:04.926
Wow, it's unbelievable.

05:04.993 --> 05:06.561
We'll continue to keep you
updated...

05:09.898 --> 05:11.098
All right, nobody move!

05:11.166 --> 05:12.900
Pay up, suckers!

05:12.968 --> 05:13.634
Hi...

05:14.937 --> 05:16.237
Welcome to the Buy More.

05:18.140 --> 05:20.141
And Merry Christmas.

05:37.626 --> 05:39.093
¶ Na-na na-na na-na ¶

05:39.161 --> 05:42.029
¶ Na-na na-na

05:42.097 --> 05:43.631
¶ Na-na na-na na-na ¶

06:04.412 --> 06:05.813
Not good...

06:05.880 --> 06:07.314
Not good. Oh, boy.

06:07.382 --> 06:08.715
Okay, Ned. Just calm down.

06:08.783 --> 06:10.617
Think, think, think.

06:10.685 --> 06:12.719
Hi, Hi.

06:12.787 --> 06:15.956
Uh, my name is
Nathan Edward Rhyerson.

06:16.024 --> 06:18.325
Uh, people like
to call me Ned.

06:18.393 --> 06:21.195
I'm sorry about the entrance.

06:21.262 --> 06:23.497
Could someone please tell me
who's in charge here?

06:23.565 --> 06:24.465
Chuck!

06:25.934 --> 06:28.769
Actually, I'm not technically
in charge.

06:28.837 --> 06:30.904
I don't want to hurt anyone,
Chuck.

06:30.972 --> 06:33.941
So, as long as no one gets
brave, no one gets shot,

06:34.008 --> 06:34.942
okay?!

06:35.009 --> 06:36.810
Okay.

06:38.813 --> 06:41.381
I think we're safe. Yeah.

06:41.449 --> 06:44.418
Um, this store has a very
strict "no bravery policy."

06:44.486 --> 06:47.454
Okay. Okay.

06:47.522 --> 06:51.658
Everyone, uh, get over there
by the Santa's Village.

06:51.726 --> 06:53.293
Now! Come on!

06:56.498 --> 06:58.632
Uh, Chuck?

06:58.700 --> 07:00.067
Where's the security system?

07:00.134 --> 07:04.471
It, um... just follow me.

07:06.508 --> 07:09.443
Right over here.

07:09.511 --> 07:11.378
Are there any other ways
in and out of the store?

07:11.446 --> 07:13.046
Um, yeah.

07:13.114 --> 07:14.848
But they're all
locked down because we

07:14.916 --> 07:16.583
technically haven't opened yet.
- Good.

07:16.651 --> 07:17.484
Lock it down.

07:33.167 --> 07:35.002
What's going on?

07:38.606 --> 07:41.575
Great, I step out of work
one time and I miss all the fun.

07:41.643 --> 07:43.744
The suspect's name
is Nathan Rhyerson.

07:43.811 --> 07:45.712
He is a civilian.
No record.

07:45.780 --> 07:46.914
Not even a speeding ticket
in the past ten years.

07:46.981 --> 07:49.883
Well, Nathan picked himself
the wrong place

07:49.951 --> 07:52.119
to be naughty
instead of nice.

07:52.186 --> 07:54.288
Now, I get to play with my new
toy I got myself for Christmas.

07:54.355 --> 07:56.490
General, if we go
in guns blazing,

07:56.558 --> 07:57.658
Chuck's cover
will be blown.

07:57.725 --> 07:59.359
The guy seems
pretty timid,

07:59.427 --> 08:00.727
not someone the local PD
couldn't handle.

08:00.795 --> 08:03.096
What are you saying,
Agent Walker?

08:03.164 --> 08:04.531
I'm saying that Chuck has
family and friends in there,

08:04.599 --> 08:05.866
and if we blow Chuck's cover,

08:05.934 --> 08:08.335
then not only he will
have to go underground,

08:08.403 --> 08:10.237
but so will
everyone else.

08:10.305 --> 08:12.739
We'll try it Agent Walker's way
first.

08:12.807 --> 08:14.741
Slip into the Buy More
from Castle

08:14.809 --> 08:16.043
and see if you can
remove Chuck

08:16.110 --> 08:18.178
without calling attention
to yourselves

08:18.246 --> 08:19.680
or the assets.

08:19.747 --> 08:20.781
Understood?

08:20.848 --> 08:22.716
Understood.

08:22.784 --> 08:24.985
Are you okay, Major?

08:25.053 --> 08:25.719
Hmm?

08:26.754 --> 08:30.223
Oh, uh, just paper cuts.

08:30.291 --> 08:33.193
I'm on gift wrap station
right now, General.

08:33.260 --> 08:34.861
It's an electronic store, Major.

08:34.929 --> 08:36.630
Not Basra.

08:36.698 --> 08:39.232
Get it under control.

08:43.837 --> 08:46.873
This is Maureen Mitsubishi,
KPFW News,

08:46.941 --> 08:48.642
reporting from
the Burbank Buy More,

08:48.710 --> 08:49.977
where some unlucky employees
are spending

08:50.044 --> 08:53.180
the day before Christmas
with an armed gunman

08:53.247 --> 08:55.315
instead of their loved ones.

08:55.383 --> 08:57.384
Who's in charge here?

08:57.452 --> 09:00.087
Well, I am, sir.
Al Powell. Burbank PD.

09:00.154 --> 09:01.288
Who are you?

09:01.356 --> 09:03.924
Lieutenant Mauser.
Hostage negotiator, LAPD.

09:03.992 --> 09:05.392
So, what's it look
like in there?

09:05.460 --> 09:07.894
Well, all indications
are everybody is safe.

09:07.962 --> 09:10.297
This guy is an amateur.

09:10.365 --> 09:12.799
Good news is that my cousin,
Mike, is the store manager.

09:12.867 --> 09:14.067
And if I know Mike,

09:14.135 --> 09:15.369
he'll have everything
under control.

09:15.436 --> 09:17.070
Hmm.

09:21.943 --> 09:24.177
Why today?

09:24.245 --> 09:25.779
You know how much money
I'm losing?

09:25.847 --> 09:28.615
All of our shoppers are
going to go to Large Mart.

09:28.683 --> 09:30.250
There, there, big man.
Just eat.

09:30.318 --> 09:31.685
It's going to be okay.

09:31.753 --> 09:32.886
It is?

09:32.954 --> 09:34.287
Yes, it is.

09:34.355 --> 09:36.289
Every news outlet
is out there.

09:36.357 --> 09:37.924
Any publicity
is good publicity.

09:37.992 --> 09:40.160
Yeah.

09:40.228 --> 09:43.163
Besides, my cousin,
Big Al, is a cop.

09:43.231 --> 09:44.798
Half of LAPD'll be here.

09:44.866 --> 09:47.200
We can get this store back open
for business by lunch, right?

09:47.268 --> 09:48.902
Hmm, maybe.

09:56.878 --> 09:59.646
Hey... Hey, Ned.
It's Chuck.

10:02.950 --> 10:04.685
That's a terrible
picture of me.

10:06.754 --> 10:08.989
Hey, you can put
your hands down.

10:09.057 --> 10:10.490
You know,
the truth is

10:10.558 --> 10:12.826
I'm really not a bad guy
once you get to know me.

10:12.894 --> 10:15.929
When you're not crashing your
car into electronics stores

10:15.997 --> 10:17.631
and waving a gun around?

10:17.699 --> 10:19.533
Yeah.

10:19.600 --> 10:22.002
Look, I know it's no excuse,
but I lost my job, man.

10:22.070 --> 10:24.638
All I wanted was to get
a few gifts for my kids

10:24.706 --> 10:26.106
so we could celebrate
Christmas.

10:26.174 --> 10:28.508
And the next thing you know,
I'm the next OJ.

10:28.576 --> 10:30.310
What am I going
to do, Chuck?

10:30.378 --> 10:32.179
I mean, they're going to put
me in jail, aren't they?

10:32.246 --> 10:35.182
No, no, maybe not.

10:35.249 --> 10:37.250
Maybe not, you know, uh...

10:37.318 --> 10:39.953
I mean, you haven't
hurt anyone yet, right?

10:40.021 --> 10:42.122
So, maybe if you give up,

10:42.190 --> 10:43.490
they'll work out
some sort of deal.

10:43.558 --> 10:44.624
Probation or something.

10:44.692 --> 10:47.494
W-Why would they do that?

10:49.797 --> 10:54.000
Look, keep this between us,
but... I know some people.

10:54.068 --> 10:56.036
You know, people who
could make all this

10:56.104 --> 10:58.371
go away as long
as you don't do anything stupid.

10:58.439 --> 10:59.573
Like who?

11:10.284 --> 11:11.218
Who's calling?

11:11.285 --> 11:13.754
Uh, that's probably the police.

11:13.821 --> 11:15.322
Maybe they want to know
what's happening.

11:15.389 --> 11:16.723
I don't want to talk to anyone.

11:16.791 --> 11:18.358
Do you think you
could answer it?

11:18.426 --> 11:20.794
Yeah.

11:20.862 --> 11:22.596
Nerd Herd. How can I help you?

11:22.663 --> 11:24.664
This is Lieutenant Mauser. LAPD.

11:24.732 --> 11:26.032
Who am I speaking with?

11:26.100 --> 11:28.301
This is Chuck Bartowski.
Nerd Herd supervisor.

11:28.369 --> 11:29.870
All right, Chuck, I'm going
to need to talk to Ned.

11:29.937 --> 11:31.671
He wants to talk to you.

11:31.739 --> 11:33.006
He doesn't want to talk to you.

11:33.074 --> 11:36.143
Okay, then you and I

11:36.210 --> 11:38.812
are going to have to work
through this ourselves.

11:38.880 --> 11:40.680
So tell me, is there
anyone hurt in there?

11:40.748 --> 11:41.681
No, nobody's hurt.

11:41.749 --> 11:44.117
Everybody's okay.

11:44.185 --> 11:45.852
Uh, Ned... is it okay
if I call you Ned?

11:45.920 --> 11:47.087
Sure, Ned's fine.
- Okay.

11:47.155 --> 11:49.389
Uh, Ned explicitly told me

11:49.457 --> 11:51.525
that he wants
absolutely no trouble.

11:51.592 --> 11:53.860
Tell him to send out a hostage
as a sign of good faith.

11:53.928 --> 11:55.862
He says that you should
send out a hostage

11:55.930 --> 11:57.998
as a sign of good faith.
- Good God, pick me!

11:58.065 --> 12:00.133
Pick me! Pick me! Pick me!
Pick me! Pick me!

12:00.201 --> 12:01.501
Pick me...

12:01.569 --> 12:05.739
My 86-year-old mother is dying
of a very rare disease.

12:05.807 --> 12:07.908
It's leukoplakia.

12:07.975 --> 12:09.576
And she needs me...

12:09.644 --> 12:10.911
her bobo.

12:13.681 --> 12:15.081
Uh... okay, fine.

12:15.149 --> 12:16.550
Send him.

12:16.617 --> 12:17.517
Oh, thank you...

12:17.585 --> 12:18.685
thank you!

12:19.754 --> 12:22.556
Thank you. Thank you.

12:22.623 --> 12:25.292
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

12:25.359 --> 12:26.193
Thank you.

12:28.896 --> 12:30.997
We're sending someone out.

12:31.065 --> 12:32.666
We got one hostage
coming out, folks.

12:33.701 --> 12:35.101
That scoundrel.

12:35.169 --> 12:36.603
I bet Bartowski
worked out a deal.

12:36.671 --> 12:39.806
Yeah, Chuck let Emmett go so he
could get better lunch shifts.

12:39.874 --> 12:41.541
That bastard's selling
us down the river,

12:41.609 --> 12:43.109
making a sweetheart deal
for himself.

12:43.177 --> 12:44.578
I guess it's prison rules now.

12:44.645 --> 12:46.947
Every man for himself.

12:49.817 --> 12:51.451
Oh, my...

12:51.519 --> 12:52.953
Who's got a phone?
Who's got a phone?

12:53.020 --> 12:54.521
I need to call my lawyer.
I need to call my therapist.

12:54.589 --> 12:56.356
I need to call my mother,
and I need to call my yogi.

12:56.424 --> 12:58.425
Maureen Mitsubishi

12:58.492 --> 12:59.893
continuing to cover the story

12:59.961 --> 13:02.095
at the Burbank Buy More,
where it seems a hostage

13:02.163 --> 13:04.197
has just been released.

13:04.265 --> 13:06.633
I'm Lieutenant Mauser, LAPD.

13:06.701 --> 13:07.934
Who are you?

13:08.002 --> 13:10.136
I'm Assistant Manager
Emmett Milbarge.

13:10.204 --> 13:12.272
That's two "T"s, two "M"s.

13:12.340 --> 13:14.407
Tell me, Emmett.
What's going on inside there?

13:14.475 --> 13:16.543
What's going on inside

13:16.611 --> 13:18.845
is the greatest sales event
of the season.

13:18.913 --> 13:20.080
That's right.

13:20.147 --> 13:21.848
We have got the best deals
in town

13:21.916 --> 13:23.683
on all your electronic needs.

13:23.751 --> 13:25.652
No, no, Emmett,
I meant the perp.

13:25.720 --> 13:27.020
Is he dangerous?

13:27.088 --> 13:28.889
Dangerous?

13:28.956 --> 13:30.156
The only thing dangerous

13:30.224 --> 13:32.125
is how low we have slashed
our prices.

13:32.193 --> 13:34.194
God bless that man.

13:34.262 --> 13:36.129
Uh, so, uh...

13:36.197 --> 13:38.198
Hey, uh, Chuck,

13:38.266 --> 13:39.399
where are these people

13:39.467 --> 13:41.134
that can get me out of this?

13:41.202 --> 13:42.769
Um...

13:46.807 --> 13:49.309
They're uh, they're closer
than you think.

13:50.912 --> 13:52.579
Can I use the bathroom?

13:52.647 --> 13:54.381
I mean, the store
is already locked down,

13:54.448 --> 13:56.216
so I can't really
go anywhere.

13:56.284 --> 13:57.550
Yeah.

13:57.618 --> 13:58.652
Sure, of course.

13:58.719 --> 13:59.886
All right.

13:59.954 --> 14:01.821
Be back in a sec.

14:08.963 --> 14:10.864
It's about time
the cavalry showed up.

14:10.932 --> 14:12.632
So what's the plan?

14:12.700 --> 14:14.935
The plan is to lock you
in the Castle till this is over.

14:15.002 --> 14:16.303
Come on...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, whoa, whoa.

14:16.370 --> 14:18.138
What about Ellie and Morgan
and everyone else?

14:18.205 --> 14:20.140
We're instructed to remove you
and only you, Chuck.

14:20.207 --> 14:21.975
There's a team coming
to extract the rest,

14:22.043 --> 14:23.343
and they will be
in good hands.

14:23.411 --> 14:24.878
I'm not just going to leave
my sister behind.

14:24.946 --> 14:26.646
There are rules, Chuck,
and we have to follow them.

14:26.714 --> 14:28.348
So let's go...
- I understand that there are rules,

14:28.416 --> 14:29.849
but when it comes
to family and friends,

14:29.917 --> 14:31.818
there's a time to break 'em.
Get in the hatch, Bartowski.

14:31.886 --> 14:33.153
Chuck, you're letting your
emotions cloud your judgment.

14:33.220 --> 14:34.421
I promise nothing bad
will happen to them.

14:34.488 --> 14:36.356
Now please, come on.

14:36.424 --> 14:39.592
I can't take that chance.
- Chuck, is that you?

14:39.660 --> 14:40.527
John, John.

14:44.298 --> 14:45.398
No, no, no, Ned!

14:45.466 --> 14:46.700
Chuck, what's going on?

14:46.767 --> 14:48.034
Ned, Ned,

14:48.102 --> 14:49.502
please, please, please
don't shoot that gun.

14:49.570 --> 14:50.704
Who are they?
- They're harmless.

14:50.771 --> 14:52.005
They're
harmless, okay?

14:52.073 --> 14:53.673
Look, they heard your crash
and they hid.

14:53.741 --> 14:54.975
This is my girlfriend, Sarah.
- Hi.

14:55.042 --> 14:56.509
Hi.
- And this is John Casey,

14:56.577 --> 14:57.911
who's even more
harmless than she is.

14:57.979 --> 14:59.012
John Casey.

14:59.080 --> 15:00.113
Ned, please,

15:00.181 --> 15:01.114
just uncock the gun.

15:04.585 --> 15:06.386
Okay.

15:06.454 --> 15:08.121
How do I do that?

15:08.189 --> 15:10.657
'Cause the truth is, I never
used one of these before.

15:10.725 --> 15:12.392
There's probably a button on it,
like a safety or something like that.

15:12.460 --> 15:14.527
Just go ahead and push...
- No, no, no!

15:14.595 --> 15:15.962
Oh, my God. Chuck!

15:18.449 --> 15:19.649
We have gunfire.

15:19.717 --> 15:20.751
I repeat: we hear gunfire.

15:20.818 --> 15:21.752
Oh! Oh! Oh!

15:21.819 --> 15:22.786
My foot!

15:22.854 --> 15:24.921
I'm so sorry.

15:24.989 --> 15:26.156
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

15:26.224 --> 15:27.524
I didn't mean to
shoot you, I promise.

15:27.592 --> 15:28.992
We need a SWAT team
down here pronto.

15:30.862 --> 15:32.029
It's okay, everyone.

15:32.096 --> 15:33.663
It was a mistake.

15:33.731 --> 15:35.432
An accidental shooting.

15:35.500 --> 15:36.500
But Casey is going

15:36.567 --> 15:37.768
to be just fine.

15:37.835 --> 15:39.703
You idiot.
You owe me a toe, Bartowski.

15:44.108 --> 15:45.442
You're gonna be okay, John.

15:45.510 --> 15:47.944
A lot of people get by
with nine toes.

15:49.213 --> 15:51.048
I'm getting by
fine with eight.

15:51.115 --> 15:52.549
How much do you think
a toe is worth to Casey?

15:52.550 --> 15:53.984
Why?

15:54.052 --> 15:56.053
Maybe there's
a finder's fee.

15:56.120 --> 15:57.788
You know, I
survived three wars

15:57.855 --> 16:00.123
without so much as
losing a fingernail

16:00.191 --> 16:01.324
before I met you,
Bartowski.

16:01.392 --> 16:03.326
Look, I'm really sorry
about your toe, John,

16:03.394 --> 16:04.895
but I had the situation
under control.

16:04.962 --> 16:06.129
You're the one
who scared him.

16:07.331 --> 16:08.899
You okay?

16:08.966 --> 16:10.534
I'm just scared.

16:10.601 --> 16:13.003
I've never been this close
to a gun before.

16:13.071 --> 16:14.738
Yeah, me, neither.

16:16.040 --> 16:17.007
You know what?
We'll...

16:17.075 --> 16:18.041
we'll be okay.

16:18.109 --> 16:19.009
We just have to stick together.

16:24.382 --> 16:26.550
Big Mike, Morgan,

16:26.617 --> 16:28.018
Jeff, Lester,
come here.

16:28.086 --> 16:30.420
Get over here.

16:30.488 --> 16:33.090
I don't know about you guys,
but I've had enough.

16:33.157 --> 16:34.558
This guy is dangerous.

16:34.625 --> 16:36.793
We need to take him out
before anyone else gets hurt.

16:36.861 --> 16:37.794
He's right.

16:37.862 --> 16:39.229
The store closes at midnight.

16:39.297 --> 16:41.164
We got lots
of merchandise to move.

16:41.232 --> 16:42.365
Fellas, I don't know.

16:42.433 --> 16:43.333
Time to be a man, Morgan.

16:44.936 --> 16:46.269
Yeah, you know, I'll do it.

16:46.337 --> 16:47.504
I'm in. I'm in.

16:47.572 --> 16:49.573
So am I.
- Wait. Hold on.

16:49.640 --> 16:51.141
This is a very,
very bad idea, okay?

16:51.209 --> 16:52.542
Ned shot Casey on accident.

16:52.610 --> 16:53.910
He's not trying to hurt anybody.

16:53.978 --> 16:55.512
We need to let the police
handle this.

16:55.580 --> 16:57.080
Chuck's right.
Let the cops handle this.

16:57.148 --> 16:59.716
I know you guys work
at a Buy More, but I'm a doctor.

16:59.784 --> 17:01.384
Okay, I
take risks

17:01.452 --> 17:02.552
every day.

17:02.620 --> 17:04.186
This is a matter
of life or death.

17:04.255 --> 17:06.056
Someone needs to man up
and take action.

17:06.124 --> 17:08.023
Someone needs to be a hero.

17:08.092 --> 17:10.193
No, they don't, Devon.

17:10.261 --> 17:11.627
Being a hero
is being alive

17:11.695 --> 17:13.230
to take care of your
friends and family.

17:14.932 --> 17:16.199
Chuck.

17:16.267 --> 17:18.068
Chuck, they keep calling.

17:18.136 --> 17:19.368
You better answer it.

17:19.436 --> 17:20.270
Yeah, coming right now.

17:20.338 --> 17:21.438
Don't do anything.

17:21.506 --> 17:23.440
Do nothing.
I will be right back.

17:24.575 --> 17:26.009
Hey, hey,

17:26.077 --> 17:27.544
I, uh... I feel terrible

17:27.612 --> 17:29.379
about shooting
your friend's toe off.

17:29.447 --> 17:30.914
No, no, no, no, that's okay.

17:30.982 --> 17:33.550
Sometimes, I feel
like shooting him myself.

17:33.618 --> 17:34.885
This is Chuck.

17:34.952 --> 17:36.119
Okay, okay, talk to me, Chuck.

17:36.187 --> 17:37.120
We heard gunfire.

17:37.188 --> 17:38.121
What's going on in there?

17:38.189 --> 17:39.122
Everything's under control.

17:39.190 --> 17:40.957
Everything is-is just fine.

17:41.025 --> 17:43.126
There was an
accidental shot fired

17:43.194 --> 17:45.162
and someone lost the majority
of their toe,

17:45.229 --> 17:46.530
but besides that,
everything's okay.

17:46.597 --> 17:47.631
<i>Put him on the phone.</i>

17:47.698 --> 17:49.199
I want to talk to him now.

17:49.267 --> 17:51.034
He wants to talk to you.
- Huh?

17:51.102 --> 17:52.602
Well, ask him what he wants.

17:52.670 --> 17:53.970
I want to know
what his demands are.

17:54.038 --> 17:55.305
He wants to know
what your demands are.

17:55.373 --> 17:57.007
Well, I don't know.

17:57.074 --> 17:59.309
Uh, I have to think about it.

17:59.377 --> 18:01.811
Can you call back
in, like, five minutes?

18:03.014 --> 18:04.681
Yeah, yeah.

18:09.787 --> 18:12.222
So, uh... so what
are you gonna do, Ned?

18:12.290 --> 18:15.859
Well, maybe I should
call my wife.

18:15.927 --> 18:18.295
She always knows what to do
in these situations.

18:18.362 --> 18:19.863
Yeah, that-that's a great idea.

18:19.931 --> 18:21.898
Maybe you could let
everyone else make a call, too,

18:21.966 --> 18:22.899
check in with
their loved ones,

18:22.967 --> 18:23.934
let them know that they're safe.

18:27.705 --> 18:29.239
Okay, Chuck.

18:29.307 --> 18:30.674
Yeah.

18:41.085 --> 18:43.853
Hey, honey, it's me.

18:43.921 --> 18:46.723
Uh... well, I'm okay.

18:46.791 --> 18:49.626
Look, uh, I know this
is gonna sound bad...

18:51.295 --> 18:52.596
Hey, Mom and Dad.

18:52.663 --> 18:53.964
Hi, guys.

18:54.031 --> 18:56.733
Yeah, everything
is awesome.

18:56.801 --> 18:59.469
Well, not really,
but we'll be okay.

19:04.842 --> 19:06.843
Hi, there. You've
reached the Love Chat Line.

19:06.911 --> 19:08.645
Looking to chat
with someone special?

19:08.713 --> 19:10.146
Press 1.

19:12.250 --> 19:13.984
Lompoc Correctional Institute.

19:14.051 --> 19:18.722
Yes, I'd like to speak
to prisoner 27318,

19:18.789 --> 19:20.657
aka Mom.

19:25.263 --> 19:26.630
Hey, baby.

19:26.697 --> 19:28.331
Save your breath, Morgan.

19:29.533 --> 19:30.867
Hey, Big Mike.

19:30.935 --> 19:32.936
How you holding up
in there, partner?

19:33.004 --> 19:35.472
Surviving, partner.

19:35.539 --> 19:37.140
Any shoppers lining up
out there?

19:38.309 --> 19:39.943
Mother?

19:40.011 --> 19:41.411
Johnny Boy.

19:44.649 --> 19:46.116
Yeah, I'm okay, uh...

20:01.732 --> 20:03.233
Hi, Chuck.

20:03.301 --> 20:04.467
Where are you?

20:04.535 --> 20:05.669
DVDs.

20:05.736 --> 20:07.637
I'm in the romantic comedy
section,

20:07.705 --> 20:09.072
although, for irony's sake,

20:09.140 --> 20:11.641
I suppose I should probably be
in hostage thrillers.

20:15.913 --> 20:20.483
So, uh, Ned let everyone
call their loved ones.

20:20.551 --> 20:22.552
That was pretty smart
to call me.

20:22.620 --> 20:23.920
Protect our cover.

20:23.988 --> 20:26.356
Yeah, well,
you are my girlfriend.

20:26.424 --> 20:27.490
Sort of.

20:29.627 --> 20:33.430
So, does that mean your offer
still stands for Christmas?

20:34.665 --> 20:37.033
See, I knew you
could be heart-warmed.

20:38.936 --> 20:40.036
I actually, um...

20:41.339 --> 20:43.473
I have something
for you.

20:43.541 --> 20:45.842
I was gonna give it
to you tomorrow,

20:45.910 --> 20:47.010
but considering
the circumstances,

20:47.078 --> 20:48.945
I kind of want
to give it to you today.

20:49.013 --> 20:50.714
Chuck, we're gonna
get out of here.

20:50.781 --> 20:53.783
We'll be fine,
I... promise.

20:58.389 --> 21:00.790
Wow.

21:00.858 --> 21:02.659
It's beautiful.

21:02.727 --> 21:05.328
It's good luck.

21:05.396 --> 21:07.430
It was my mom's charm bracelet.

21:07.498 --> 21:12.068
My dad gave it to her
when Ellie was born.

21:13.938 --> 21:16.072
Oh, Chuck, I can't take this.

21:16.140 --> 21:17.607
This is something real,

21:17.675 --> 21:19.142
something that you should give
to a real girlfriend.

21:22.913 --> 21:24.581
I know.

21:29.353 --> 21:30.987
Chuck.

21:31.055 --> 21:32.856
Duty calls.

21:41.532 --> 21:42.699
Hey, this is Chuck.

21:42.767 --> 21:44.501
Chuck, what does he want?

21:44.568 --> 21:46.035
This is Lieutenant Mauser.

21:46.103 --> 21:47.637
He wants to know
what you want.

21:47.705 --> 21:49.773
I want to go home and spend
Christmas with my family.

21:57.848 --> 22:01.351
All right. Tell him
I'm coming in, Chuck.

22:01.419 --> 22:02.352
I'm unarmed.

22:02.420 --> 22:03.820
I just want to talk

22:03.888 --> 22:07.056
so we can get him and everybody
else home for Christmas.

22:07.124 --> 22:08.091
Okay.

22:08.159 --> 22:09.893
Okay, all right, yeah,

22:09.960 --> 22:11.661
I'm-I'm gonna come open the door
right now.

22:24.308 --> 22:27.544
I'm completely unarmed, Ned.

22:27.611 --> 22:30.580
Just want a little face time
so we can talk this out.

22:30.648 --> 22:32.315
Chuck, you come back over here.

22:40.057 --> 22:41.291
Okay,

22:41.358 --> 22:42.625
I don't want to go to jail.

22:42.693 --> 22:45.528
It's okay.
We're gonna work on that.

22:45.596 --> 22:47.330
But in the meantime,
what do you say

22:47.398 --> 22:49.532
you and I make a trade, okay?

22:49.600 --> 22:51.668
Me

22:51.735 --> 22:53.803
for two of your hostages.

22:53.871 --> 22:56.473
It'd make a lot
of people out there

22:56.540 --> 22:58.107
feel a whole lot easier.

22:58.175 --> 22:59.309
Yeah,

22:59.376 --> 23:00.443
in here, too.

23:06.183 --> 23:07.383
Okay,

23:07.451 --> 23:08.585
okay,

23:08.652 --> 23:09.819
two people can go.

23:09.887 --> 23:11.321
Okay, good, good.

23:11.388 --> 23:14.524
Um, what do you say we start
with the injured man?

23:14.592 --> 23:16.693
He looks like he needs
medical attention.

23:16.760 --> 23:17.360
I'm fine.

23:17.428 --> 23:19.329
Good. Let Ellie go.

23:19.396 --> 23:20.597
No, no, Casey,

23:20.664 --> 23:22.131
thank you,
but you need to go.

23:22.199 --> 23:23.633
Your toe could
be infected.

23:23.701 --> 23:24.834
Chuck,

23:24.902 --> 23:26.903
you've been a good friend to me,

23:26.971 --> 23:29.539
so I'm gonna return the favor.

23:29.607 --> 23:30.406
I'm gonna let
your girlfriend go.

23:31.775 --> 23:32.842
No!

23:35.379 --> 23:35.912
Chuck?

23:37.882 --> 23:39.249
Ouch.
- Yikes.

23:39.316 --> 23:40.817
It'll be a cold
Christmas

23:40.885 --> 23:42.385
at the Bartowskis.

23:42.453 --> 23:43.486
Oh, no, he didn't.

23:43.554 --> 23:46.589
I didn't. I don't...

23:46.657 --> 23:49.425
I don't mean I don't want
my girlfriend to leave

23:49.493 --> 23:52.495
because clearly,
I would really like for Sarah

23:52.563 --> 23:54.130
to leave and be
out of harm's way.

23:54.198 --> 23:55.298
That's not what
I'm saying.

23:55.366 --> 23:57.066
What I'm saying...
what I'm saying

23:57.134 --> 23:58.735
is that...

24:04.375 --> 24:05.909
I'm not your only friend here,

24:05.976 --> 24:07.343
Ned,

24:07.411 --> 24:08.444
you've endeared yourself

24:08.512 --> 24:09.546
into the hearts
of everyone here.

24:09.613 --> 24:10.580
I think we're all friends.

24:10.648 --> 24:11.981
This is a... we're a family.

24:12.049 --> 24:13.383
We've gonna through a lot,
haven't we?

24:13.450 --> 24:14.751
So we should all leave.
Why don't we all leave together?

24:17.555 --> 24:19.088
No, just those two.

24:19.156 --> 24:19.956
Okay!

24:22.059 --> 24:24.727
Our team just arrived.

24:24.795 --> 24:26.596
Don't do anything stupid.

24:26.664 --> 24:28.731
Maybe the rest of us
can get out of here

24:28.799 --> 24:29.632
without losing
an appendage.

24:29.700 --> 24:33.469
Uh, Chuck, it's okay.

24:33.537 --> 24:38.575
Trust me.
I'll never let anyone hurt you.

24:38.642 --> 24:39.776
Okay.

25:00.731 --> 25:02.732
Good to finally meet you
face-to-face, Chuck.

25:02.800 --> 25:04.867
Yeah.
- Did a hell of a job.

25:04.935 --> 25:07.270
Pretty impressive
for a retail jockey.

25:07.338 --> 25:11.574
I just want all this over
as soon as possible.

25:11.642 --> 25:13.309
So do I, Chuck.

25:13.377 --> 25:14.777
So do I.

25:24.388 --> 25:25.688
Hey,

25:25.756 --> 25:27.690
don't worry about it, buddy.
I'm a pro.

25:27.758 --> 25:30.193
Everything's gonna
be just fine,

25:30.260 --> 25:31.527
okay?

25:38.616 --> 25:40.517
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

25:40.585 --> 25:43.553
Chuck, look,
you did a good job,

25:43.621 --> 25:45.088
but I'll take it from here,
okay?

25:45.156 --> 25:46.256
Yeah, but-but you know what?

25:46.324 --> 25:47.524
Um, Ned is really uptight,

25:47.592 --> 25:49.226
so maybe, maybe I should go
over there

25:49.293 --> 25:51.461
and talk to him and tell him
that you're taking over.

25:51.529 --> 25:52.462
Kind of put him
at ease

25:52.530 --> 25:53.830
so he doesn't
get upset.

25:53.898 --> 25:55.098
So you guys developed
a little trust, did you?

25:55.166 --> 25:56.266
Yeah.

25:56.334 --> 25:59.569
Okay. Oh, yeah, good idea.

25:59.637 --> 26:01.371
Good.

26:06.878 --> 26:08.645
Listen to me, Ned,

26:08.713 --> 26:09.746
you have to listen to me
very carefully.

26:09.814 --> 26:10.881
This guy Mauser-- he is no good.

26:10.948 --> 26:12.149
He is not a good guy, okay?

26:12.216 --> 26:14.151
We cannot trust him.
- Why not?

26:14.218 --> 26:15.752
We have to let everybody
out of the store right now.

26:15.820 --> 26:17.521
If I let everyone out,

26:17.588 --> 26:19.289
then I'm not gonna have
any bargaining chips.

26:19.357 --> 26:21.591
I can't go
to jail, Chuck.

26:23.061 --> 26:25.095
Okay, look, the people
I was talking about--

26:25.163 --> 26:27.097
the people that can help, they
work for the government, see?

26:27.165 --> 26:28.665
They will do anything
they can to protect me.

26:28.733 --> 26:31.401
That's the only bargaining
chip that you need.

26:31.469 --> 26:32.869
Ned, you have to trust me.

26:32.937 --> 26:34.137
You need to let everyone go.

26:34.205 --> 26:35.639
I haven't let you down yet,
have I?

26:35.706 --> 26:40.010
Thanks, Chuck.
I'll take it from here.

26:40.078 --> 26:41.978
Okay, okay.

26:47.452 --> 26:49.086
Well, Ned...

26:49.153 --> 26:51.254
it's time the rubber
hits the road.

26:51.322 --> 26:53.023
What do you say
we make a deal?

26:55.026 --> 26:56.993
Hmm?

27:02.767 --> 27:05.102
Hey, no, look, no, no,
that's okay; that's okay.

27:05.169 --> 27:06.970
You need medical attention,
Major Casey.

27:07.038 --> 27:08.238
No, I'm fine. Let's end this.

27:08.306 --> 27:09.406
How's it look in there?

27:09.474 --> 27:10.574
Better. Ned seemed
to calm down

27:10.641 --> 27:12.342
after he talked
to his wife.

27:12.410 --> 27:15.479
Yeah, where is she?
You didn't bring her down here.

27:15.546 --> 27:17.614
Wife? What wife? There's no
record of Ned being married.

27:23.421 --> 27:26.389
He's right. There's no record
of him being married.

27:26.457 --> 27:28.592
We saw him make a call.

27:28.659 --> 27:31.461
Trace it. See if we can find out
who he was speaking to.

27:36.200 --> 27:37.801
Look, boys,

27:37.869 --> 27:39.703
this guy is tired and frazzled.

27:39.770 --> 27:41.605
I say we take him out.

27:41.672 --> 27:42.906
Anyone else play ball
in college?

27:42.974 --> 27:44.508
Played some linebacker.
- I did not.

27:44.575 --> 27:46.376
I did a lot of Madden on the
PlayStation 3. Does that count?

27:46.444 --> 27:47.777
Be bold, Morgan.

27:50.481 --> 27:51.848
All right, I'm in.

27:51.916 --> 27:55.118
All right. Listen up.
It's called "The Picket Fence."

27:55.186 --> 27:57.254
Big Mike and I will be
the flanks, all right?

27:57.321 --> 27:59.356
Morgan, you're
the sacrificial lamb.

27:59.423 --> 28:00.257
Jeff, Lester,

28:00.324 --> 28:01.391
you're coming up from behind.

28:01.459 --> 28:02.826
Why are we always
coming up from behind?

28:02.894 --> 28:03.894
It seems awkward.

28:03.961 --> 28:04.928
I need everybody...

28:04.996 --> 28:06.596
Hey, hey,
what are you doing?

28:06.664 --> 28:08.231
Well, we're taking
this guy out.

28:08.299 --> 28:09.399
You in?

28:09.467 --> 28:10.901
No, and neither are you.
This situation

28:10.968 --> 28:12.802
is way too dangerous.

28:12.870 --> 28:13.904
Please, Devon,

28:13.971 --> 28:15.539
if you love Ellie,

28:15.606 --> 28:17.474
don't do this.

28:23.548 --> 28:25.015
Okay, Chuck, you win.

28:25.082 --> 28:27.751
Chuck, can I talk

28:27.818 --> 28:28.552
to you a minute?

28:30.354 --> 28:32.889
Remember: don't be awesome.

28:36.260 --> 28:38.595
Hey.

28:38.663 --> 28:39.863
Well, Chuck, it looks

28:39.931 --> 28:41.898
like Ned and I have worked
the whole thing out.

28:41.966 --> 28:43.333
That's great! That's great!

28:43.401 --> 28:45.302
I'll just go tell everybody
that we can leave.

28:45.369 --> 28:47.671
No, no, no, no,
not just yet, but soon.

28:47.738 --> 28:50.473
First, you and I need to work
something out on our own.

28:50.541 --> 28:52.676
I don't understand.

28:52.743 --> 28:55.312
You see, FULCRUM knows
John Casey's NSA.

28:57.782 --> 29:01.651
The person he called
is in the Buy More right now.

29:01.719 --> 29:03.653
The yogurt girl's CIA.

29:03.721 --> 29:07.123
Oh, my God. Chuck.

29:07.191 --> 29:08.925
We've lost enough agents
to these two.

29:08.993 --> 29:10.193
We knew they were here
protecting someone.

29:10.261 --> 29:11.228
We just didn't know who.

29:11.295 --> 29:13.463
So we caused
a little ruckus,

29:13.531 --> 29:17.267
sent Ned inside to see
who they would rush to protect.

29:17.335 --> 29:20.770
Turns out...
they're protecting you.

29:23.908 --> 29:26.142
I have no idea what you're
talking about, Lieutenant.

29:26.210 --> 29:28.912
Do you see, uh, Ned over there?

29:31.649 --> 29:33.750
I'd hate to see him shoot
your pretty little sister

29:33.818 --> 29:35.518
if he thought you were
not cooperating with me.

29:39.757 --> 29:41.491
Look, I'm, I'm just an analyst,
okay?

29:41.559 --> 29:43.026
Please don't hurt anyone.

29:43.094 --> 29:44.894
Chuck, you're way more
than just an analyst.

29:44.962 --> 29:47.097
We did a background
check on you.

29:47.164 --> 29:49.199
Turns out you were
college roommates

29:49.267 --> 29:50.567
with Bryce Larkin.

29:50.635 --> 29:51.835
The same Bryce Larkin

29:51.902 --> 29:53.937
that stole the Intersect
from us.

29:54.005 --> 29:55.405
Bryce Larkin is dead.

29:55.473 --> 29:58.241
And I'm done negotiating.

29:59.710 --> 30:01.144
Wait.

30:01.212 --> 30:03.513
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Stop him. Stop him.

30:03.581 --> 30:05.282
Please stop him.

30:06.617 --> 30:09.419
What do you want?

30:09.487 --> 30:12.222
I want to know where Bryce
Larkin and the Intersect is.

30:12.290 --> 30:16.559
And if I think you're lying
even a little bit,

30:16.627 --> 30:18.128
your sister dies.

30:20.631 --> 30:23.033
Where's Bryce Larkin?

30:28.272 --> 30:29.406
I don't know.

30:29.473 --> 30:31.308
Then I'm really sorry.

30:31.375 --> 30:33.476
But I know where
the Intersect is.

30:33.544 --> 30:35.045
Where?

30:42.887 --> 30:44.354
It's right here.

30:54.706 --> 30:57.775
All right, Chuck,
this is how it's gonna play out.

30:57.843 --> 31:01.612
Ned's gonna release
another hostage: you.

31:01.680 --> 31:03.247
Then you and I
are gonna go out

31:03.315 --> 31:05.116
and get into an ambulance,
which will take you

31:05.184 --> 31:08.286
to a secure FULCRUM facility,
where you'll stay.

31:10.522 --> 31:15.393
I'm never gonna see
my sister again, am I?

31:15.461 --> 31:17.795
No.

31:20.299 --> 31:21.866
Well, then would you mind

31:21.934 --> 31:23.501
if I said good-bye to her,
please?

31:23.569 --> 31:27.805
Okay.

31:27.873 --> 31:31.642
But if you say or do anything
to call attention

31:31.710 --> 31:36.047
to me or your situation,
Ned's gonna shoot her,

31:36.115 --> 31:37.882
<i>capisce?</i>

31:37.950 --> 31:39.417
Yeah.

31:42.054 --> 31:44.922
Okay, good.

31:44.990 --> 31:45.823
Go ahead.

31:56.201 --> 31:57.235
They're letting me go.

31:57.302 --> 31:59.303
Oh, thank God.

32:00.772 --> 32:03.007
Good-bye, Ellie.

32:03.075 --> 32:05.543
You know how much I love you,
right?

32:05.611 --> 32:09.147
Hey! Hey, cheer up.
It'll be okay.

32:09.214 --> 32:10.915
You're acting like you're
never going to see me again.

32:10.983 --> 32:12.750
It's okay.

32:12.818 --> 32:14.519
See you in a bit, Chuck.

32:14.586 --> 32:16.721
Listen, there's a time
to be brave

32:16.788 --> 32:18.956
and a time to be timid.

32:19.024 --> 32:21.225
This is a time to be brave.
Do it.

32:21.293 --> 32:24.162
Right on, bro.

32:24.229 --> 32:28.566
Sir! Sir, over here!
Can we get a statement, sir?

32:35.440 --> 32:36.941
Maureen Mitsubishi

32:37.009 --> 32:39.277
back at the Buy More where,
apparently, another hostage

32:39.344 --> 32:41.679
has just been released.

32:41.747 --> 32:44.248
We're not sure of his identity,
but he does appear

32:44.316 --> 32:46.450
to be unharmed.

32:46.518 --> 32:48.019
FULCRUM's got Chuck.

32:48.086 --> 32:49.720
Everybody ready?

32:49.788 --> 32:50.755
Yeah.

32:50.822 --> 32:52.123
Hands in.

32:52.191 --> 32:53.824
Break.

32:57.062 --> 32:59.030
I hope they're not
doing anything risky.

32:59.097 --> 33:00.831
Morgan's with them.

33:00.899 --> 33:03.234
Trust me. You've got
nothing to worry about.

34:02.027 --> 34:03.861
They're getting away with Chuck.

34:16.041 --> 34:17.174
Hey, get back here!

34:25.217 --> 34:26.851
He's breathing.

34:26.918 --> 34:29.453
He's fine. That was
really stupid, Devon.

34:29.521 --> 34:30.521
At least he's
not afraid

34:30.589 --> 34:33.056
to take a risk like Morgan.

34:33.125 --> 34:35.458
Finally,
this is getting interesting.

34:35.527 --> 34:38.795
Okay, who's next?

34:40.498 --> 34:42.433
You?

34:57.215 --> 34:58.616
What the...?

35:06.291 --> 35:08.926
Oh!

35:12.497 --> 35:14.365
Man, did you see that?

35:14.433 --> 35:15.900
Lester?

35:15.967 --> 35:18.469
Are you okay?

35:18.537 --> 35:21.038
That was so brave.

35:24.176 --> 35:26.777
Well, in times of crisis,
a man...

35:26.845 --> 35:28.412
needs to step up.

35:28.480 --> 35:31.015
You know, be a man,

35:31.083 --> 35:32.650
I think they say.

36:04.082 --> 36:05.383
Lieutenant Mauser's FULCRUM.
So's Ned... it was all a set-up.

36:05.384 --> 36:06.684
I know.

36:06.752 --> 36:08.252
Everyone in the store
is still in danger.

36:08.320 --> 36:09.820
Our team is moving in on them
right now; they'll be fine.

36:09.888 --> 36:11.489
Now I need you
to run back as fast as you can

36:11.556 --> 36:12.656
to the Castle.

36:12.724 --> 36:14.158
I can't leave you alone
with this guy.

36:14.226 --> 36:15.526
Your safety is more important
than mine.

36:15.594 --> 36:18.562
Now leave and don't
turn back. Go.

36:18.630 --> 36:20.731
Go.

37:25.230 --> 37:26.931
You may have beaten me,
Agent Walker,

37:26.998 --> 37:30.134
but FULCRUM's won.

37:30.202 --> 37:33.704
I know Chuck Bartowski's
the Intersect.

37:33.772 --> 37:35.539
Chuck's secret is safe.

37:35.607 --> 37:37.975
And you're going straight
to a CIA detention facility,

37:38.043 --> 37:39.443
never to be seen
or heard from again.

37:41.012 --> 37:44.281
You go right ahead,
Agent Walker.

37:44.349 --> 37:48.285
Arrest me.

37:48.353 --> 37:50.221
But say "good-bye"
to Chuck.

37:50.288 --> 37:53.724
I'm not like those
other FULCRUM agents.

37:53.792 --> 37:56.494
They'll do whatever
it takes to find me.

37:56.561 --> 37:57.795
And when they do,

37:57.863 --> 38:00.731
every FULCRUM agent we have

38:00.799 --> 38:02.466
is going to know
Chuck's the Intersect.

38:05.937 --> 38:07.738
It's going to be the end
of his pathetic existence.

38:13.578 --> 38:15.312
So take me in,
Agent Walker.

38:15.380 --> 38:16.814
Ready to go.

38:33.899 --> 38:34.932
Oh, God...

39:39.509 --> 39:40.909
Hey, how are you doing?
- Okay.

39:40.977 --> 39:43.412
I thought I was about
to lose you there for a minute.

39:43.479 --> 39:44.980
It was hell,
but I survived.

39:45.048 --> 39:46.748
Hey, you hungry?
- I could eat.

39:56.125 --> 39:58.427
Ellie.

39:58.494 --> 39:59.862
I thought you'd like to know

39:59.929 --> 40:01.330
that I cancelled
my skydiving trip.

40:01.397 --> 40:02.564
Are you sure?

40:02.632 --> 40:04.132
I thought you needed
more excitement.

40:04.200 --> 40:05.601
I've had all the excitement
I need, honey.

40:13.977 --> 40:15.677
Thanks.
- For what?

40:15.745 --> 40:17.346
Staying with me.

40:17.413 --> 40:18.614
I would've been
alone tonight.

40:18.681 --> 40:20.515
Hmm, me, too.

40:25.555 --> 40:27.289
Anna?

40:33.830 --> 40:35.697
Gross!

40:49.145 --> 40:51.013
Chuck!

40:56.085 --> 40:57.152
It's okay.

40:57.220 --> 40:58.520
You're safe.

40:58.588 --> 40:59.755
I got the FULCRUM agent.

40:59.822 --> 41:01.957
What happened to him?

41:02.025 --> 41:03.258
I arrested him.

41:03.326 --> 41:04.693
Casey's taking him
to a secure facility

41:04.761 --> 41:06.595
as we speak.

41:08.431 --> 41:10.766
It's okay.
He's going to go to jail.

41:10.833 --> 41:12.034
He'll never bother you again.

41:15.405 --> 41:17.039
Merry Christmas, guys.
- Merry Christmas.

41:17.106 --> 41:18.774
Merry Christmas.

41:18.841 --> 41:20.375
Merry Christmas, Chuck.

41:20.443 --> 41:23.045
It's not going to be one
we're going to forget soon, huh?

41:23.112 --> 41:25.814
Uh, yeah.
- Oh, that looks fantastic on you.

41:25.882 --> 41:27.316
Oh, thank you.

41:27.383 --> 41:28.884
I'm so glad
that you have it.

41:28.952 --> 41:30.152
Yeah, me, too.

41:50.773 --> 41:52.741
Let me ask you something.

41:52.809 --> 41:54.876
What do you do when
you see your girlfriend

41:54.944 --> 41:56.545
do something
so horrific,

41:56.612 --> 41:59.548
it's permanently burned
into your brain?

42:00.917 --> 42:02.250
I don't know, buddy.

42:04.354 --> 42:07.522
But I know
exactly what you mean.
