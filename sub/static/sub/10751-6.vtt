00:42.680 --> 00:44.120
Are you nearly finished, Roy?

00:44.120 --> 00:44.760
Yep.

00:44.760 --> 00:46.000
You're taking a long time.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.120
It's a complicated problem.

00:48.120 --> 00:50.680
There are a lot of
Shabaranks in your hard drive.

00:50.680 --> 00:52.920
I'm sure I can crack it eventually.

00:52.920 --> 00:55.560
Arrgh, it's frustrating!

00:55.560 --> 00:58.280
Come on, work, work!

00:59.520 --> 01:01.400
Do you know
anything about digital cameras?

01:01.400 --> 01:03.800
Roy might.

01:03.800 --> 01:07.120
I do, as it happens. I'm an amateur
photographer, actually.

01:07.120 --> 01:10.120
I've just got this new one,
but it's really complicated.

01:10.120 --> 01:12.920
Oh. That's fixed.

01:12.920 --> 01:14.440
What was wrong with it?

01:14.440 --> 01:16.520
It wasn't turned on. Oh...

01:16.520 --> 01:18.320
I don't know why I got rid
of my old one,

01:18.320 --> 01:19.960
it was perfectly fine.

01:19.960 --> 01:21.760
Yeah, well, these all look good.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.040
What's going on with this fella?

01:25.040 --> 01:27.240
Look at him!

01:27.240 --> 01:31.040
He's pulling a mad face,
he looks completely mental!

01:31.040 --> 01:33.720
That's Dave, my brother.

01:33.720 --> 01:36.120
He's got a very serious condition.

01:39.400 --> 01:45.120
When I said mental there, I meant
mental in the sense of intelligent.

01:45.120 --> 01:49.600
You know, like
he's...he's a big reader.

01:49.600 --> 01:51.400
He has boss-eyedness.

01:51.400 --> 01:52.960
Boss-eyedness?

01:52.960 --> 01:55.360
He's permanently boss-eyed.

01:58.040 --> 02:00.400
That must be a big pain in the arse.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.080
It is, and the terrible thing is,

02:02.080 --> 02:05.080
people think there's actually
something funny about this.

02:05.080 --> 02:09.560
No! Who could think there's
something funny about this?

02:11.200 --> 02:16.240
It's a proper condition and
he...he really suffers, he really...

02:16.240 --> 02:18.320
Oh, hey.

02:18.320 --> 02:21.040
I'd just give anything
if Dave could have a normal life.

02:21.040 --> 02:22.800
Oh, hey, now.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.560
Kimberly, are you OK?

02:24.560 --> 02:26.680
It's just Dave.

02:26.680 --> 02:30.080
Oh, poor Dave.

02:30.080 --> 02:32.040
Hey, I've got a great idea.

02:32.040 --> 02:35.840
Why don't we all do something to
raise money for people like Dave?

02:35.840 --> 02:38.960
Yeah, we must be able to think
of something, like a fun run!

02:38.960 --> 02:40.240
That's a good idea.

02:40.240 --> 02:41.880
Or a nude calendar.

02:44.160 --> 02:47.480
That's maybe even a better
idea than the fun run idea!

02:47.480 --> 02:50.840
We could call it "The
Girls of the Seventh Floor".

02:52.000 --> 02:56.640
Yes! Yes! It's a very strong theme!

02:56.640 --> 02:59.800
Roy could be the photographer.

02:59.800 --> 03:03.960
I could do the photographs, because
I said I was an amateur photographer!

03:03.960 --> 03:05.640
Come on, let's do a brainstorm.

03:05.640 --> 03:07.520
I'd like to be November
if that's OK.

03:07.520 --> 03:08.600
Can I be April?

03:08.600 --> 03:09.640
Yes!

03:09.640 --> 03:12.800
And on October, we've got
to have a Halloween theme...

03:16.760 --> 03:20.680
'Boss-eyedness is something
which affects 1% of Britons.

03:20.680 --> 03:22.560
'It doesn't impair eyesight,

03:22.560 --> 03:26.920
'and yet people with boss-eye are
routinely discriminated against.

03:26.920 --> 03:29.080
'Just like any form
of discrimination,

03:29.080 --> 03:30.760
'it should be stopped.

03:30.760 --> 03:33.400
'But we can only
do so with your help.

03:33.400 --> 03:36.040
'That's right, we're looking
at you.'

03:38.560 --> 03:40.000
It's not funny, Jen.

03:42.720 --> 03:44.680
It's a very serious condition!

03:44.680 --> 03:47.000
I know it is, I know it is.
I'm sorry.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.200
This is exactly the kind

03:49.200 --> 03:51.440
of discrimination
that we are fighting against.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.960
And what do you need from me?

03:53.960 --> 03:56.840
I just need a little time off work.

03:56.840 --> 03:59.640
We're trying to raise
some money for the boss-eyed.

04:01.240 --> 04:03.560
Oh, who? Who is?

04:03.560 --> 04:05.200
Just me and some people.

04:05.200 --> 04:06.320
Oh, yeah? Who?

04:06.320 --> 04:09.000
Some people from upstairs.
You wouldn't know them.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.280
What are you going to do?

04:10.280 --> 04:11.320
Hi.

04:11.320 --> 04:12.800
Hi.

04:12.800 --> 04:13.840
Hiya.

04:13.840 --> 04:16.200
What are you talking about?

04:16.200 --> 04:20.160
Oh, nothing, I'm just talking
to Jen about a private project.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.920
What is it?

04:21.920 --> 04:26.920
It's just a...just a private
project I'm doing that's private.

04:26.920 --> 04:28.800
What is it?

04:28.800 --> 04:30.360
It's just a thing!

04:30.360 --> 04:34.080
It's a just big bloody pain
in the arse thing that I might do.

04:34.080 --> 04:36.520
Oh, you are being modest.

04:36.520 --> 04:39.960
It's a very kind thing you're doing,
very generous, very charitable.

04:39.960 --> 04:43.360
I really am impressed,
you know, good for you.

04:43.360 --> 04:45.680
What's he done,
persuaded all the girls on seven

04:45.680 --> 04:48.000
to do a nude calendar for charity?

04:54.960 --> 04:56.840
Bye!

04:56.840 --> 04:58.040
Bye, Moss!

05:00.880 --> 05:02.080
Oh, God, he's right.

05:02.080 --> 05:05.080
Oh, how the hell? No, no...

05:05.080 --> 05:08.160
Oh, he made it sound sleazy!

05:08.160 --> 05:10.160
It is sleazy.

05:10.160 --> 05:11.760
Oh, what kind of man would want

05:11.760 --> 05:15.120
to photograph a bunch of beautiful
women without any clothes on, Roy?

05:15.120 --> 05:18.120
The kind of man who
wants to help people, Jen!

05:18.120 --> 05:21.240
No, I don't like it.
I find it very offensive.

05:21.240 --> 05:23.160
No, it's going to be tasteful.

05:23.160 --> 05:24.320
No, it's not.

05:24.320 --> 05:26.720
You're right, it's not!

05:26.720 --> 05:30.680
It's going to be rude, it's going
to be sexy! All the things men like,

05:30.680 --> 05:33.160
and it'll make
a million quid for that charity.

05:33.160 --> 05:34.440
No, no, no, absolutely not.

05:34.440 --> 05:35.520
Why not?

05:35.520 --> 05:39.320
Taking your clothes off,
if it's unemployed men

05:39.320 --> 05:41.440
or old ladies from Yorkshire,
it's fun.

05:41.440 --> 05:43.880
If it's sexy women,
it's not fun - it's oppression.

05:43.880 --> 05:46.040
No, I will not give you
time off for this!

05:46.040 --> 05:49.400
Well, OK, I will do it
in my own time.

05:49.400 --> 05:51.560
Oh, Roy, you're behaving
like a horny teenager.

05:51.560 --> 05:52.920
No, you are.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.440
For God's sake,
try and have some dignity.

05:55.440 --> 05:56.760
No, I won't, I won't.

05:56.760 --> 05:57.280
Sit down.

05:57.280 --> 05:58.320
I'm not going to.

05:58.320 --> 05:59.960
Have an adult conversation...

05:59.960 --> 06:02.040
I'm going to do it. And it's for
charity,

06:02.040 --> 06:04.080
and there's nothing you can do about
it!

06:04.080 --> 06:05.640
You're embarrassing yourself!

06:05.640 --> 06:10.600
Roy, stop it! Come back here, Roy!
Don't be silly! Come back! Roy!

06:14.120 --> 06:14.840
Thank you.

06:14.840 --> 06:17.760
I'm really pleased
we've had this conversation.

06:17.760 --> 06:18.960
Thanks for seeing us.

06:18.960 --> 06:21.800
Any advice you want about anything,
come and see me...

06:21.800 --> 06:22.840
Hiya.

06:22.840 --> 06:25.200
Roy, thank God you're here.

06:25.200 --> 06:28.680
Jen's just been telling us how
the calendar would have been sexist.

06:28.680 --> 06:29.920
Oh, has she?

06:29.920 --> 06:33.160
It would be much better if we used
old ladies or unemployed men in it.

06:33.160 --> 06:35.560
Oh, good.

06:35.560 --> 06:39.600
She thinks we'll make a lot more
money because of the "aah factor".

06:39.600 --> 06:40.800
The "aah factor"?

06:40.800 --> 06:42.240
Yeah, the "aah factor".

06:42.240 --> 06:44.960
The thing that makes you go "aah"
when you hear about it.

06:44.960 --> 06:49.880
Ah, yeah, but will anyone actually
want to see old women

06:49.880 --> 06:51.600
or destitute men with no clothes on?

06:51.600 --> 06:55.800
Won't that just make people
go "aargh", rather than "aah"?

06:55.800 --> 06:57.880
Guys, I've got a great idea.

06:57.880 --> 07:00.640
Why don't we all ask
our grans to do the calendar?

07:00.640 --> 07:02.160
That's a great idea!

07:02.160 --> 07:05.440
Oh, Nadine, you
are just so full of ideas!

07:05.440 --> 07:08.360
But can I, hold on one second,

07:08.360 --> 07:10.160
what's our theme?

07:10.160 --> 07:15.240
Isn't our theme "Girls of the Seventh
Floor"? That was a very strong theme.

07:15.240 --> 07:16.960
Yes, Roy, but now the theme can be

07:16.960 --> 07:19.120
"Grans of the Girls
of the Seventh Floor".

07:19.120 --> 07:22.480
Oh, yeah...I don't want
to take photos of grannies.

07:22.480 --> 07:25.000
This could do very well, Roy.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.840
This could be tasteful, like
the one Helen Mirren did. Old ladies

07:28.840 --> 07:32.800
pot plants covering their bits,
you know. An erotic calendar

07:32.800 --> 07:34.360
the whole family could enjoy.

07:34.360 --> 07:35.840
Roy, you can't drop out now.

07:35.840 --> 07:38.120
Douglas has already
paid for the studio time.

07:38.120 --> 07:39.160
What? Has he?

07:39.160 --> 07:42.120
Yeah, he's really very
interested in this project.

07:42.120 --> 07:46.360
I just have to say how I'm finding
this whole thing just so moving,

07:46.360 --> 07:50.320
how so many men have come up
to me and shown interest and support

07:50.320 --> 07:54.680
for the calendar. I mean, people
really do care about the boss-eyeds.

07:59.640 --> 08:02.760
You can't drop out now!

08:02.760 --> 08:05.440
I wasn't
wrong about you, was I, Roy?

08:07.520 --> 08:10.240
I thought you were special.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.280
I am,

08:12.280 --> 08:14.080
I'm so special.

08:14.080 --> 08:19.640
I...no... I...let's do it,
let's go round up those grans!

08:23.440 --> 08:26.200
Thank you! Oh, thank you!

08:26.200 --> 08:27.640
That's OK.

08:32.760 --> 08:33.760
Hi.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.440
Hi.

08:35.440 --> 08:38.280
You don't have to do this. We could
just get a proper photographer.

08:38.280 --> 08:40.640
Oh, no, I'm happy to do it.

08:40.640 --> 08:42.400
How's it going?

08:42.400 --> 08:46.160
Not a great start, I have to say.
Of all the girls on seven, only

08:46.160 --> 08:49.680
nine have grans that are still alive.

08:49.680 --> 08:56.560
Of that nine, one is having a hip
replacement on the day of the shoot.

08:56.560 --> 09:02.040
One is a little senile,
and may not know what's happening.

09:02.040 --> 09:05.680
And the last one, the last one

09:05.680 --> 09:08.640
has a gangrenous arm,

09:08.640 --> 09:11.320
but she still wants to do it.

09:11.320 --> 09:15.600
So all I have to do now is hit
the streets and find six old women

09:15.600 --> 09:18.880
I've never met who would be happy to
take all of their clothes off

09:18.880 --> 09:20.680
and let me take photographs of them.

09:20.680 --> 09:22.680
Why are you doing this?

09:22.680 --> 09:26.280
Same reason I do everything, Jen -
to have sex with a lady.

09:27.360 --> 09:30.280
Ahh.

10:40.318 --> 10:42.398
What?!

10:42.398 --> 10:46.558
I said...do you want
to be in a nude calendar?

10:46.726 --> 10:48.246
Do I want a calendar?!

10:48.246 --> 10:49.806
No, no, no.

10:49.806 --> 10:57.646
Do...you...want...to do
a nude calendar for charity?

10:57.646 --> 11:02.006
Oh, for charity. Oh, well,
in that case, yes, I'll take it.

11:02.006 --> 11:02.846
How much is it?

11:02.846 --> 11:05.446
No, no, no, no, no.

11:05.446 --> 11:09.086
Do you want
to do a calendar?

11:09.086 --> 11:12.766
But the doctor's already
changed my catheter.

11:12.766 --> 11:14.726
No, no, no.

11:15.926 --> 11:19.046
I need you to take
all your clothes off

11:19.046 --> 11:21.446
and have me take
photographs of you!

11:23.446 --> 11:27.846
Oh, you remembered
your old mum's birthday.

11:33.366 --> 11:34.966
TELEPHONE RINGS

11:34.966 --> 11:35.486
IT.

11:35.486 --> 11:37.566
Jen, hi.

11:37.566 --> 11:40.806
I wanted you to know if this
calendar doesn't make Â£1 million,

11:40.806 --> 11:42.806
I'm holding you
personally responsible.

11:42.806 --> 11:44.926
What?! That's not very fair.

11:44.926 --> 11:48.046
I'm sad to say that the only
secure route to a knighthood

11:48.046 --> 11:50.686
in this sorry age is
via charity work.

11:50.686 --> 11:53.926
You can't do that, Mr Reynholm.
It wasn't my idea.

11:53.926 --> 11:57.366
Nonetheless,
the idea came from your department

11:57.366 --> 12:00.846
and, as head of the department,
it's your nuts on the block.

12:00.846 --> 12:02.206
Oh, Mr Reynholm, I...

12:02.206 --> 12:03.766
Don't worry, Jen.

12:03.766 --> 12:07.286
Just make it as sexy as hell
and watch the money poor in.

12:07.286 --> 12:10.966
Sexy, sexy, sexy.
Every page sexier than the last.

12:10.966 --> 12:11.406
Mr Reynholm...

12:11.406 --> 12:14.086
DIAL TONE

12:14.086 --> 12:18.966
Oh, grans! Grans aren't sexy.
That's not gonna make any money!

12:20.606 --> 12:23.006
What kind of society
are we living in?

12:25.806 --> 12:27.086
What? >

12:27.086 --> 12:30.726
Apparently, we are living in
the kind of society that sees a man

12:30.726 --> 12:34.726
who just wants to take
naked photos of some old ladies

12:34.726 --> 12:36.886
as some sort of weirdo,

12:36.886 --> 12:41.086
who deserves to be
chased and shouted at

12:41.086 --> 12:43.566
and beaten and chased!

12:44.646 --> 12:46.566
Did you tell them
it was for the boss-eyeds?

12:46.566 --> 12:48.366
Oh, I did, I did.

12:48.366 --> 12:52.166
I did tell them and you know what
happened? They just laughed at me.

12:52.166 --> 12:53.206
What?!

12:53.206 --> 12:55.246
They just laughed at me, Jen.

12:55.246 --> 12:57.686
They don't care
about the boss-eyeds!

12:57.686 --> 12:59.766
Wait, Roy. You know what?

12:59.766 --> 13:02.966
Maybe we should rethink
the theme a little bit.

13:02.966 --> 13:06.806
"Grans of the girls of the
seventh floor" is such a mouthful.

13:06.806 --> 13:10.286
Why not just bring it back to
"Girls of the seventh floor"?

13:10.286 --> 13:11.486
You said it was sexist!

13:11.486 --> 13:13.766
Oh, bleurgh. It's empowering!

13:13.766 --> 13:16.246
Sexist? How dare you be
so patronising.

13:16.246 --> 13:18.166
Oh, no! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

13:18.166 --> 13:22.966
And you'd enjoy it, Roy! You'd love
to take those photos, wouldn't you?

13:22.966 --> 13:27.086
You'd enjoy taking them, I bet you
would. You'd enjoy that a lot more!

13:27.086 --> 13:30.726
Do you know what I'm talking about,
eh, eh, eh, eh?!

13:30.726 --> 13:31.766
I don't know, Jen.

13:31.766 --> 13:32.966
Oh, come on!

13:32.966 --> 13:36.206
No, no. You know, I don't think
that Kimberly would like it.

13:36.206 --> 13:39.766
I don't wanna make any wrong moves
there. I cannot blow this one!

13:39.766 --> 13:44.526
Kimberly is the best thing that's
ever happened to me and she hasn't
really happened to me yet.

13:44.526 --> 13:47.526
We are not gonna make
any money with grannies.

13:47.526 --> 13:48.526
Well, er...

13:48.526 --> 13:50.566
I'm back!

13:50.566 --> 13:52.566
What, what do you mean?

13:52.566 --> 13:54.926
I'm back from holiday.

13:56.686 --> 13:57.686
You were on holiday?!

13:57.686 --> 13:59.966
Yes, I was on holiday.

14:01.246 --> 14:01.806
Oh, that's right.

14:01.806 --> 14:03.926
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

14:03.926 --> 14:05.366
You didn't know I was on holiday?

14:05.366 --> 14:07.926
No, no, we did.
Where did you go?

14:07.926 --> 14:11.286
You didn't know I was on holiday!

14:11.286 --> 14:15.246
Oh, we did, we did.
We missed you.

14:15.246 --> 14:17.086
I've been gone a week!

14:17.086 --> 14:19.326
A week?! Wow!

14:25.886 --> 14:27.046
Mm...

14:27.046 --> 14:28.566
What?

14:28.566 --> 14:29.686
You know what's very in now?

14:29.686 --> 14:30.726
I don't.

14:30.726 --> 14:33.606
Geeks. You lot.

14:33.606 --> 14:37.486
The whole nerd thing.
Geek chic. It's very in.

14:37.486 --> 14:39.406
So?

14:39.406 --> 14:44.446
So it's a calendar that
celebrates scientific achievement.

14:44.446 --> 14:45.686
That's right.

14:45.686 --> 14:47.766
About time!

14:47.766 --> 14:50.606
Think of it as an opportunity
to re-enact

14:50.606 --> 14:53.566
all of your favourite moments
from the history of science.

14:56.366 --> 14:57.806
And maths?

14:57.806 --> 14:59.006
And maths.

14:59.006 --> 15:00.526
Yes!

15:01.126 --> 15:04.606
Oh, I'm sorry.
Excuse me. ..Yep?

15:04.606 --> 15:06.966
OK, are they all there? Yep.

15:06.966 --> 15:09.406
Yeah, so you've rounded up
all your best looking friends?

15:09.406 --> 15:12.046
Yep.

15:12.046 --> 15:15.886
OK, great, Roy, OK. Remember,
it's got to be sexy. Sexy, sexy!

15:17.766 --> 15:19.206
Yep.

15:21.166 --> 15:25.086
OK, so, if the rest of you
want to take lunch...

15:26.686 --> 15:28.366
..I'll do Moss first.

15:33.726 --> 15:35.246
Laters.

15:35.246 --> 15:39.006
So I'll hold up the beaker like,
"Ah! I've discovered something."

15:39.006 --> 15:40.366
Exactly. Yes.

15:40.366 --> 15:41.926
But what have I discovered?

15:41.926 --> 15:43.046
It doesn't matter.

15:43.046 --> 15:45.446
I think it does a bit, actually.

15:45.446 --> 15:49.646
Um...OK.
You have discovered nuclear bombs.

15:49.646 --> 15:51.846
In a beaker?!

15:51.846 --> 15:56.406
You're right, it's surprising,
so give me surprised.

15:57.686 --> 16:01.566
Yeah, that's it,
and it's, it's confusing.

16:03.206 --> 16:06.726
Yes, you're confused,
and you are afraid

16:06.726 --> 16:11.086
of the consequences of the discovery.
Give me fear, fear! Yeah! That's it!

16:11.086 --> 16:14.606
That's good. OK, nice, nice.

16:14.606 --> 16:19.526
And if...
if you're hot or anything, Moss,

16:19.526 --> 16:22.406
maybe you could undo
some buttons on your shirt.

16:23.526 --> 16:25.486
No, I'm all right, thanks, Roy.

16:25.486 --> 16:28.366
Maybe just undo your top button.

16:28.366 --> 16:30.126
Why?

16:31.246 --> 16:35.566
It's hot, it's a hot lab,
because of all the fusion.

16:35.566 --> 16:36.446
Fission!

16:36.446 --> 16:37.846
Fission, yeah.

16:40.686 --> 16:42.406
That's it.

16:42.406 --> 16:44.326
Maybe just one more button.

16:47.526 --> 16:50.606
OK, that's good.

16:50.606 --> 16:55.326
And maybe you could, er...maybe
you could get down on all fours.

16:56.886 --> 16:58.566
Why?

16:58.566 --> 17:03.206
Because you had some microscopic
nuclear things and you dropped them.

17:03.206 --> 17:04.886
Oh, right.

17:04.886 --> 17:06.126
Big klutz.

17:06.126 --> 17:07.646
Oh, oh, nightmare!

17:07.646 --> 17:09.445
Yeah, they're down there somewhere.

17:09.445 --> 17:11.246
Oh, it's a pain. Where are they?

17:11.246 --> 17:13.486
Yeah, you're getting angry.

17:13.486 --> 17:14.846
Oh, well, I would!

17:14.846 --> 17:18.165
Yes, because you can't
find them. Oh, grr!

17:18.165 --> 17:20.366
You growl when
you can't find stuff!

17:20.366 --> 17:20.925
Grrr!

17:20.925 --> 17:22.486
That's it!

17:22.486 --> 17:26.006
And there are other people in
the lab and they're being so noisy.

17:26.006 --> 17:27.566
OK. Shh!

17:27.566 --> 17:29.526
That's it.

17:29.526 --> 17:31.086
A bit less of...

17:31.086 --> 17:32.766
Yes.

17:32.766 --> 17:34.846
And then it occurs to you that

17:34.846 --> 17:38.406
maybe you put your microscopic
nuclear things in your back pocket.

17:38.406 --> 17:41.246
Oh, did I? Oh, no.

17:41.246 --> 17:43.446
Oh, that's a pain.

17:43.446 --> 17:47.046
Why would they be there?
And yet I've put them there.

17:47.046 --> 17:47.766
Oh, it's strange.

17:47.766 --> 17:50.566
Yeah. You're working hard,
you know, you're tired.

17:50.566 --> 17:52.046
Oh, well, I've been busy.

17:52.046 --> 17:54.126
And they're being noisy again!

17:54.126 --> 17:56.406
Shh, shh!

17:56.406 --> 17:58.446
That's good, Moss.

17:58.446 --> 18:00.406
Yeah... Shh!

18:00.406 --> 18:02.886
OK, so just give me a...

18:02.886 --> 18:05.926
a cheeky, sort of,
I've been a naughty boy look.

18:08.046 --> 18:10.446
But I've just solved
Fermat's theorem.

18:10.446 --> 18:14.006
Yes, but you've solved it in a way

18:14.006 --> 18:18.006
that the stuffed shirts of the time
would have found very naughty.

18:18.006 --> 18:20.926
Am I Fermat? Because...

18:20.926 --> 18:24.726
If I am, these clothes are wrong.

18:26.846 --> 18:30.806
It's, it's, you're more, you're...
you're a naughty mathematician.

18:30.806 --> 18:33.286
Roy, you...
you're doing it wrong.

18:33.286 --> 18:36.006
The lighting is all wrong.

18:36.006 --> 18:40.886
The pictures will be very gloomy.
This whole set-up is inadequate.

18:40.886 --> 18:43.246
It's a celebration.

18:43.246 --> 18:46.006
You've just discovered penicillin.

18:51.526 --> 18:53.286
But why are our tops off?

18:55.126 --> 18:58.046
I always take my top off when
I'm celebrating, don't you?

18:59.566 --> 19:01.606
Well, yes, yes, of course, yeah.

19:01.606 --> 19:03.206
OK...

19:03.206 --> 19:05.566
Cavort!

19:09.606 --> 19:11.326
That's it, yeah.

19:11.326 --> 19:13.966
Yeah! Oh!

19:15.286 --> 19:17.686
Thank god for
all that penicillin!

19:18.766 --> 19:21.206
Touch each other in
a celebratory way.

19:22.886 --> 19:25.726
Yeah, that's it!

19:25.726 --> 19:28.246
Yeah! Yes!

19:28.246 --> 19:30.206
That's good.

19:31.606 --> 19:34.046
That's it. Ruffle your hair now.

19:34.046 --> 19:36.806
That's good, OK, nice, nice.

19:36.806 --> 19:39.926
That's it. A little bit,
a bit more shoulder like that.

19:49.206 --> 19:52.486
You, pick him up like a wheelbarrow

19:52.486 --> 19:56.966
and then walk around
and then you come in this way, OK?

19:57.646 --> 20:00.686
(ON TV) '..any form of
discrimination should be stopped.

20:00.686 --> 20:03.366
'But we can only do so
with your help.

20:03.366 --> 20:06.446
'That's right,
we're looking at you.'

20:06.446 --> 20:10.766
Thank you. I just wanted
to say a few words.

20:10.766 --> 20:12.366
Hey, come on, we did it.

20:14.526 --> 20:16.486
This is exciting, isn't it?

20:16.486 --> 20:19.366
Reynholm Industries' first
sexy new charity calendar.

20:19.366 --> 20:21.966
Come on, Goofy, we want
to see the calendar.

20:21.966 --> 20:24.486
I can't wait.

20:24.486 --> 20:29.486
I hereby announce that speech over
and the calendar ready to go.

20:29.486 --> 20:31.046
< (ALL) Yeah!

20:31.046 --> 20:35.046
I think I speak for all men when I
say I can't wait to get that box open

20:35.046 --> 20:38.446
and feast my eyes upon
its sexy contents! Oh, yeah!

20:46.766 --> 20:49.966
Whoa! Someone's played
an awful prank!

20:49.966 --> 20:53.046
There's nothing here but
gloomy pictures of morons.

20:53.046 --> 20:57.406
No, not morons - geeks. They're
sexy now. You know, geek chic.

20:57.406 --> 20:59.206
Geek chic?!

20:59.206 --> 21:01.406
I wanna tear my eyes out!

21:01.406 --> 21:03.846
This is horrible. Horrible!

21:05.086 --> 21:06.766
This is your fault.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.726
It was Roy's idea.

21:10.326 --> 21:13.686
You idiot! I wouldn't buy this
and it's in aid of me!

21:13.686 --> 21:14.686
I didn't do it.

21:14.686 --> 21:16.086
I'm talking to her!

21:16.086 --> 21:18.806
It's hard to tell
with your mad eyes.

21:18.806 --> 21:20.326
Sorry we're late.

21:20.326 --> 21:22.286
Here are the calendars, brilliant!

21:22.286 --> 21:24.806
Oh, great, we're on a calendar!

21:24.806 --> 21:26.766
Box fresh.

21:30.566 --> 21:34.206
There goes the entire
audience for our calendar...

21:35.846 --> 21:37.806
..and they got it for free!

21:44.126 --> 21:46.926
Roy, I don't care
that no-one liked the calendar.

21:46.926 --> 21:50.966
That was the nicest thing
that anyone's ever done for me.

21:50.966 --> 21:52.406
Really?

21:52.406 --> 21:53.886
Really.

22:00.526 --> 22:03.166
'The doctor's already
changed my catheter.'

22:04.886 --> 22:07.366
Roy, what's wrong?

22:07.366 --> 22:11.246
Oh, nothing. Er, no, I'm...

22:11.246 --> 22:14.726
Don't let me stop
the kissing! Let's...

22:16.166 --> 22:18.006
'Shh.'

22:21.286 --> 22:23.886
Roy, are you OK?

22:23.886 --> 22:26.606
Mm-hm, I'm just tired.

22:26.606 --> 22:28.526
Lips. Oh...

22:31.966 --> 22:34.006
'Cavort!'

22:34.006 --> 22:35.206
'You're doing it wrong.

22:35.206 --> 22:37.246
Cavort! You're doing it wrong.'

22:37.246 --> 22:40.046
'The doctor's already
changed my catheter.'

22:40.046 --> 22:41.766
'Cavort!'

22:49.646 --> 22:51.126
Agh!

22:51.126 --> 22:53.486
Roy, what is it?

22:53.486 --> 22:55.446
Kimberly...

22:56.886 --> 22:58.646
..it's not gonna work out.
