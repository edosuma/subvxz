00:04.528 --> 00:06.779
What the heck is kohlrabi?

00:06.813 --> 00:08.147
It's a German turnip.

00:08.180 --> 00:09.899
Does it taste good?

00:09.950 --> 00:12.201
It's a German turnip.

00:12.235 --> 00:13.736
(Sighs)

00:13.787 --> 00:17.623
Daikon? Uh, komatsuna?
This is why I miss Iowa.

00:17.658 --> 00:18.874
People ate normal things

00:18.909 --> 00:21.026
like potatoes and corn
and lard.

00:21.044 --> 00:22.962
Again, just a dinner party.

00:22.996 --> 00:25.047
You're not required to serve
gourmet food.

00:25.082 --> 00:27.049
But these are our friends
from the country club.

00:27.084 --> 00:29.835
I want to impress them.
I want to impress Michael.

00:29.869 --> 00:31.170
Oh, you don't have to worry
about that.

00:31.204 --> 00:32.838
He's crazy about you.

00:32.872 --> 00:34.557
He is, isn't he?

00:34.591 --> 00:36.392
Okay.
Let's go with the jicama.

00:36.426 --> 00:38.678
I think I've heard of that one.

00:38.712 --> 00:40.045
(Chuckles)

00:40.063 --> 00:43.015
So for dessert, what do you...

00:45.435 --> 00:46.719
(Lowered voice)
Is that Olivia?

00:46.737 --> 00:48.104
(Lowered voice)
What am I gonna do?

00:48.155 --> 00:50.690
- Relax. She hasn't seen us yet.
- Okay.

00:50.724 --> 00:51.824
Oh!

00:51.858 --> 00:54.560
(Clattering)

00:54.578 --> 00:56.912
<i>And now she has.</i>

00:59.232 --> 01:00.666
(Lowered voice)
Why is she coming over here?

01:00.701 --> 01:02.668
(Lowered voice) It's okay.
I got your back.

01:02.703 --> 01:05.705
Marisol,
I thought that was you.

01:05.739 --> 01:07.072
Hello, Olivia.

01:07.090 --> 01:08.874
I don't mean to interrupt,

01:08.908 --> 01:10.176
but I've been wanting
to talk to you.

01:10.210 --> 01:12.044
I feel I owe you an apology.

01:12.078 --> 01:13.596
An apology?

01:13.630 --> 01:15.297
I was so rude the other day.

01:15.348 --> 01:17.600
I don't blame you for throwing
me out of Michael's house.

01:17.634 --> 01:19.185
I deserved it.

01:19.219 --> 01:21.587
Wow.

01:21.605 --> 01:24.023
I'm really not a bad person,
Marisol.

01:24.057 --> 01:26.192
I wish you could've known me
before the divorce,

01:26.226 --> 01:28.778
back when I was happy.

01:28.812 --> 01:31.697
Anyway, I hope you can
forgive me.

01:31.732 --> 01:33.065
Sure I can,

01:33.099 --> 01:35.818
but it was Taylor's party
that you ruined.

01:35.869 --> 01:39.739
You should apologize to her.

01:39.773 --> 01:41.123
Oh.

01:41.158 --> 01:43.826
See, here's the problem.

01:43.877 --> 01:46.712
I don't apologize to whores.

01:46.747 --> 01:48.881
And I'm not speaking
metaphorically

01:48.915 --> 01:50.332
when I use that word.

01:50.383 --> 01:52.284
She's an actual whore.
Men used to pay her for sex.

01:52.302 --> 01:54.953
In fact,
that's how she met Michael.

01:54.971 --> 01:57.006
Oh, was that a secret?

01:57.057 --> 01:59.141
Oops.

He's here.

(Clears throat)

03:00.854 --> 03:03.021
Maxwell!
It's so good to see you.

03:03.039 --> 03:04.707
My dear friends.

03:04.741 --> 03:06.075
How many years has it been?

03:06.126 --> 03:07.693
Too many.

03:07.711 --> 03:09.912
(Kisses) How was your flight
from Savannah?

03:09.963 --> 03:11.080
Bumpy, but I survived.

03:11.131 --> 03:12.214
So sorry to hear about

03:12.249 --> 03:13.582
you and Sheila
getting a divorce.

03:13.633 --> 03:16.051
Yeah, and I was so sorry
to read about

03:16.086 --> 03:17.469
your maid getting murdered.

03:17.504 --> 03:21.173
Yes. Well, we've both had
a run of bad luck.

03:25.262 --> 03:27.713
What are you doing?

03:27.731 --> 03:29.899
I'm going to Remi's fraternity
to get the rest of his stuff.

03:29.933 --> 03:31.016
Remember?

03:31.050 --> 03:33.385
Yes, well, something's come up.

03:33.403 --> 03:35.821
The spa
is out of my face cream,

03:35.856 --> 03:37.239
so I need you to run
to the Valley

03:37.274 --> 03:38.908
to pick up a jar.

03:38.942 --> 03:41.193
Can't you have it delivered?

03:41.227 --> 03:43.579
Well, that would take all day,
and I need it now.

03:43.613 --> 03:45.731
When I looked in the mirror
this morning,

03:45.749 --> 03:47.333
I found a new wrinkle.

03:47.367 --> 03:49.418
Really? Just the one?

03:49.452 --> 03:50.786
(Huffs)

03:50.837 --> 03:52.838
I will ignore
that vicious attack

03:52.873 --> 03:56.408
because you are about to do me
the sweetest of favors.

03:56.426 --> 03:58.377
Fine. I will go all the way
to the Valley

03:58.411 --> 04:00.045
for a single jar of face cream.

04:00.079 --> 04:01.380
You know what?

04:01.414 --> 04:03.098
Get yourself one, too.

04:03.133 --> 04:05.217
I've seen tighter skin
on elbows.

04:05.251 --> 04:08.721
(Laughs) I love the way
we tease each other.

04:08.755 --> 04:10.723
Who has a better time
than we do?

04:10.757 --> 04:12.191
I'll ask around.

04:12.225 --> 04:13.692
And don't worry about Remi.

04:13.727 --> 04:16.312
I'll let him know there's been
a change of plans.

04:20.983 --> 04:23.369
He's all yours.

04:23.403 --> 04:26.956
Thank you,
Mrs. Delatour.

04:29.326 --> 04:31.777
(Hands rub together and clap)

04:31.795 --> 04:33.295
Mm.

04:33.330 --> 04:35.998
You ever get hungry?

04:36.049 --> 04:37.249
Yeah.

04:37.283 --> 04:38.884
Interesting.

04:38.919 --> 04:41.053
And what do you do
in those situations?

04:41.087 --> 04:44.289
Do you go to a place
where food is available...

04:44.307 --> 04:47.226
I'm not going to dinner
with you, Sam.

04:47.260 --> 04:49.979
What? (Chuckles) How did you
even jump to that?

04:50.013 --> 04:51.013
Go away!

04:51.064 --> 04:53.015
(Laughs)

04:53.066 --> 04:54.483
All right.

04:54.517 --> 04:55.968
Maybe you're under
the impression

04:55.986 --> 04:58.136
that I try this hard
with every girl I meet.

04:58.154 --> 05:00.105
- Uh... (Laughs)
- I don't.

05:00.139 --> 05:02.241
I... I just got a feeling
about us.

05:02.275 --> 05:04.810
And I think
you're feeling it, too.

05:04.828 --> 05:07.029
Come on. Look me in the eye
and tell me I'm wrong.

05:09.115 --> 05:10.449
Okay. I like you.

05:12.085 --> 05:14.169
Let's say we go to dinner.
I continue to like you.

05:14.204 --> 05:16.255
We have a couple of drinks.
I like you more.

05:16.289 --> 05:17.756
It turns out
that you can dance,

05:17.791 --> 05:19.925
and I like you
a little too much.

05:19.960 --> 05:21.176
The next thing I know,

05:21.211 --> 05:22.878
we're married,
we have two kids,

05:22.929 --> 05:27.383
I stop singing, and then
I don't like you at all!

05:27.434 --> 05:30.686
But those are
good-looking kids, right?

05:30.720 --> 05:33.338
Seriously?
I got work to do.

05:33.356 --> 05:35.057
(Huffs)
Okay.

05:35.108 --> 05:36.976
But...

05:37.010 --> 05:41.447
<i>At some point, you are gonna
say yes to me.</i>

05:41.481 --> 05:44.483
No, Sam, I won't.

05:53.026 --> 05:55.828
(Rustling)

06:07.340 --> 06:10.592
<i>¿Que tal, Rosita?</i>

06:10.643 --> 06:12.594
That lawyer promised he could
bring my son here.

06:12.645 --> 06:15.898
But now he says that he needs
to file more papers.

06:15.932 --> 06:17.483
That will cost
hundreds of dollars.

06:17.517 --> 06:19.151
I can't afford that.

06:19.185 --> 06:20.886
What am I gonna do?

06:20.904 --> 06:22.271
Please don't ask for a loan.

06:22.322 --> 06:23.655
Not before breakfast.

06:23.690 --> 06:26.358
I wouldn't ask
if I wasn't so broke.

06:26.392 --> 06:27.943
This is why
you should learn to save.

06:27.994 --> 06:29.862
Maybe you shouldn't go
to the movies so much.

06:29.896 --> 06:31.396
<i>What?</i>

06:31.414 --> 06:33.449
Seriously. You could have
what you need in a few months.

06:33.500 --> 06:36.035
I can't wait a few months.
I need my son, now.

06:36.069 --> 06:38.287
Hey, watch your tone.

06:38.338 --> 06:40.238
I'm sorry.

06:40.256 --> 06:42.424
But this is important to me.

06:42.459 --> 06:44.626
And after all I've done
for you,

06:44.677 --> 06:47.129
I thought maybe
you'd want to help.

06:47.180 --> 06:49.348
Oh, my God.

06:49.382 --> 06:51.517
You're blackmailing me.

06:51.551 --> 06:53.052
Huh?

06:53.086 --> 06:54.970
That's what this is, isn't it?

06:55.021 --> 06:57.272
You're trying to shake me down
because you saw me with Cody.

06:57.307 --> 06:59.108
No, no.
I'm not shaking nobody.

06:59.142 --> 07:01.360
You think you can control me?

07:01.394 --> 07:03.028
Well, you can't.

07:03.063 --> 07:05.097
I'm calling your bluff,
señorita.

07:05.115 --> 07:07.099
You go ahead and tell
old Spence about my affair.

07:07.117 --> 07:09.952
I'll get a divorce
before I give in to extortion.

07:09.986 --> 07:12.121
What's going on?

07:12.155 --> 07:14.239
Nothing.

07:14.273 --> 07:16.125
I heard yelling.

07:16.159 --> 07:18.160
(Huffs)
Rosie asked for a loan.

07:18.211 --> 07:19.611
I said no.

07:19.629 --> 07:21.997
We're done.

07:22.048 --> 07:23.499
Unless there's something else

07:23.550 --> 07:25.584
you wanted to say
to Mr. Spence.

07:41.901 --> 07:45.804
I was 20 when I came to L.A.

07:45.822 --> 07:50.526
And I just knew I was gonna be
in the movies.

07:50.577 --> 07:52.161
The closest I got was a diner

07:52.195 --> 07:55.247
across the street from Paramount.

07:55.281 --> 07:57.249
You were a waitress?

07:57.283 --> 07:59.118
For six years.

07:59.152 --> 08:02.087
And I could never
make ends meet.

08:02.122 --> 08:03.172
(Sighs)

08:03.206 --> 08:04.923
And then one day
this man walks in,

08:04.958 --> 08:06.842
and he seemed so nice.

08:06.876 --> 08:11.130
We got to talking,
and this... nice man

08:11.164 --> 08:16.301
tells me he has a lot of
lonely, rich friends.

08:16.335 --> 08:19.671
And then he asked me if I'd like
to make some easy money.

08:19.689 --> 08:22.307
Isn't it funny
how our lives can turn

08:22.341 --> 08:25.227
on just one simple question?

08:25.278 --> 08:28.247
And one stupid answer.

08:28.281 --> 08:30.199
(Sighs)

08:30.233 --> 08:32.284
(Voice breaking) God, if Olivia
starts telling people the truth,

08:32.318 --> 08:34.119
Michael will be humiliated.

08:34.154 --> 08:36.488
Then you should tell him.
Soon.

08:36.522 --> 08:38.740
Will you be there when I do?

08:38.791 --> 08:42.193
Please. I don't know
how he'll react.

08:42.212 --> 08:43.412
(Sighs)

08:43.462 --> 08:45.247
Sure. I'll be there.

08:45.298 --> 08:47.633
Thank you.

08:47.667 --> 08:49.868
And thanks for not judging me.

08:49.886 --> 08:54.556
Oscar Wilde said,
"Every saint has a past,

08:54.591 --> 08:57.392
and every sinner
has a future."

08:59.095 --> 09:00.545
Well, which am I?

09:00.563 --> 09:03.265
Aw, honey. You're both.

09:03.316 --> 09:06.401
Just like the rest of us.

09:10.056 --> 09:13.075
So we're at dinner,
and Sheila looks up and says,

09:13.109 --> 09:15.327
"I'm tired
of listening to you talk."

09:15.361 --> 09:18.580
That is how my wife decided
to end 20 years of marriage.

09:18.615 --> 09:20.065
It is her loss, my darling.

09:20.083 --> 09:22.000
<i>No one ever thought
she deserved you.</i>

09:22.035 --> 09:23.202
Thank you, Evelyn.

09:23.236 --> 09:25.003
The good news is,
you're single again,

09:25.038 --> 09:26.505
in the prime of life.

09:26.539 --> 09:28.507
This is your time
for adventure.

09:28.541 --> 09:31.460
(Chuckles) Meaning what,
nightclubs, singles bars?

09:31.511 --> 09:33.095
After all these years,

09:33.129 --> 09:34.713
I'd feel a little lost
in that world.

09:34.747 --> 09:37.299
You just need someone
to guide you. That's all.

09:37.350 --> 09:39.084
Mm. Well...

09:39.102 --> 09:40.469
Perhaps.

09:40.520 --> 09:42.471
(Sets glass down)
I'm a little tired.

09:42.522 --> 09:45.057
If you don't mind, I've been up
since 4:00 A.M. Eastern time.

09:45.091 --> 09:47.092
Go on.
Take a little nap.

09:47.110 --> 09:48.593
Thank you again
for holding my hand

09:48.611 --> 09:50.762
during this depressing time.

09:50.780 --> 09:52.447
We'll find a way
to lift your spirits.

09:52.482 --> 09:54.733
Don't you worry.

09:58.321 --> 09:59.771
No.

09:59.789 --> 10:01.606
Excuse me?

10:01.624 --> 10:03.992
I know what you're planning,
and I said no.

10:05.778 --> 10:08.547
Our agreement doesn't
give you veto power.

10:08.581 --> 10:11.083
Then I'll ask nicely.

10:11.117 --> 10:12.718
This man is my friend.

10:12.752 --> 10:14.336
Please leave him alone.

10:14.387 --> 10:16.421
Oh, my God.

10:16.455 --> 10:18.507
You have feelings for him.

10:18.558 --> 10:19.624
Oh, don't be stupid.

10:19.642 --> 10:21.126
Yes, you do. I can see it.

10:21.144 --> 10:23.428
You have a little crush.

10:23.462 --> 10:25.397
And you're fat.
So what?

10:25.431 --> 10:28.600
Well, this is delicious.
Her heart beats.

10:28.634 --> 10:29.735
Tell me more.

10:29.769 --> 10:31.236
I'm serious, Adrian.

10:31.271 --> 10:33.138
If you have
any regard for me whatsoever,

10:33.156 --> 10:35.107
you will not involve him in
your disgusting little hobby.

10:35.141 --> 10:37.809
So the question is,
do I have any regard for you?

10:37.827 --> 10:39.444
Damn it, Adrian.

10:39.478 --> 10:41.613
Don't corrupt him
just to hurt me.

10:44.167 --> 10:47.669
I'm gonna introduce Maxwell Rose
to wanton carnality

10:47.704 --> 10:50.756
for his own middle-aged good.

10:50.790 --> 10:55.677
The fact that it will hurt you
is just a bonus.

11:07.589 --> 11:09.456
The car's loaded.
If there's anything else,

11:09.474 --> 11:11.291
you'll probably
have to come back for it.

11:11.309 --> 11:13.810
Nah, I'm good.
This is just trash anyway.

11:13.845 --> 11:16.229
Just let me throw it away,
and we can get going.

11:16.264 --> 11:18.649
Wait. Wait.

11:18.683 --> 11:20.350
Why are you throwing that away?

11:20.401 --> 11:22.269
It's ruined.

11:22.303 --> 11:24.304
It got ripped, see?

11:24.322 --> 11:26.740
Only along the seam.

11:26.774 --> 11:30.694
That's nothing.
I can fix that in two seconds.

11:30.745 --> 11:32.696
Wh...
You carry a sewing kit?

11:34.282 --> 11:36.700
I like to be prepared.

11:41.822 --> 11:42.923
(Remi)
Wow.

11:42.957 --> 11:44.207
That is amazing.

11:44.258 --> 11:45.676
Not really.

11:45.710 --> 11:47.494
Seriously. I wouldn't know
how to do that.

11:47.512 --> 11:49.880
Well, you don't have to.
You have money.

11:49.931 --> 11:51.998
Most people can't afford
to throw a shirt away

11:52.016 --> 11:53.500
because of a little rip.

11:53.518 --> 11:55.802
(Exhales)
Right.

11:55.836 --> 11:58.271
You must think
I am spoiled rotten.

11:58.306 --> 12:01.141
I think you're spoiled.

12:01.175 --> 12:02.726
But not rotten.

12:04.312 --> 12:06.813
Now take off your shirt.

12:06.847 --> 12:08.315
(Huffs)
Excuse me?

12:08.349 --> 12:10.150
I'm gonna want to see this
on you.

12:10.184 --> 12:11.985
I'll be done in a minute.

12:18.242 --> 12:20.360
Maybe two minutes.

12:20.378 --> 12:23.029
(Both chuckle)

12:23.047 --> 12:25.365
(Footsteps approach)

12:25.383 --> 12:28.051
Hey there. You got a sec?

12:30.505 --> 12:32.839
I'm so sorry
about what happened.

12:32.873 --> 12:34.508
You know, it's one thing
for Peri to yell at me.

12:34.542 --> 12:37.094
But for her to raise her voice
to you, that's inexcusable.

12:37.145 --> 12:38.378
Don't worry about it.

12:38.396 --> 12:39.813
I do.
I see how hard you work.

12:39.847 --> 12:41.765
You're the one that makes
this house a home.

12:41.816 --> 12:43.850
And I'm beyond grateful.

12:43.884 --> 12:45.769
Thank you.

12:47.822 --> 12:49.272
I understand
you need some money

12:49.323 --> 12:51.775
to bring your son to America.

12:53.361 --> 12:54.945
Yes.

12:54.996 --> 12:57.531
I hope this helps.

12:59.083 --> 13:00.167
(Gasps)

13:00.201 --> 13:02.536
Oh.

13:02.570 --> 13:04.538
Mr. Spence...

13:04.572 --> 13:06.406
It's a gift, from me to you.

13:06.424 --> 13:08.291
Peri doesn't need to know.

13:09.910 --> 13:12.045
(Crying)
Thank you so, so much.

13:12.079 --> 13:15.132
You're such a good man.

13:15.183 --> 13:17.134
(Exhales)

13:17.185 --> 13:19.519
And you are an amazing woman.

13:19.554 --> 13:21.805
Mm.

13:23.891 --> 13:25.308
He had an erection?

13:25.359 --> 13:26.610
Yes.

13:26.644 --> 13:28.111
A boner.

13:28.146 --> 13:30.113
<i>Un salchichón de cemento.</i>

13:30.148 --> 13:31.364
What did you say?

13:31.399 --> 13:32.532
What could I say,
"Congratulations"?

13:32.567 --> 13:34.234
I got outta there.

13:34.268 --> 13:35.452
Congratulations?

13:35.486 --> 13:38.405
Ohh. He's very big.

13:38.439 --> 13:40.607
How big?

13:40.625 --> 13:42.492
Uh...

13:42.543 --> 13:44.377
Like this?

13:44.412 --> 13:46.129
More like...
(Gasps)

13:46.164 --> 13:47.330
...this.

13:47.381 --> 13:48.632
- You lie.
- Oh, my...

13:48.666 --> 13:50.500
- I swear.
- Can we put the produce away?

13:50.551 --> 13:52.452
(Singsongy)
The gardener's staring.

13:52.470 --> 13:54.554
So this money,
he just gave it to you?

13:54.589 --> 13:57.007
Yes.
He said it was a gift.

13:57.058 --> 14:01.978
Are you sure his intentions
were... honorable?

14:02.013 --> 14:03.463
What do you mean?

14:03.481 --> 14:05.315
When rich men give poor women
that kind of money,

14:05.349 --> 14:07.634
they usually expect
something in return.

14:07.652 --> 14:10.937
No.
Mr. Spence is not like that.

14:10.971 --> 14:13.240
Are you sure? I mean,
he did have his... cucumber

14:13.274 --> 14:14.991
jammed into your thigh.

14:15.026 --> 14:16.860
Maybe you shouldn't take
the money.

14:16.911 --> 14:18.528
No! I need it for Miguel.

14:18.579 --> 14:21.248
Just make it clear that he's
not getting anything in return.

14:21.282 --> 14:22.699
We're maids.

14:22.750 --> 14:24.201
The only thing we polish
is their silver.

14:24.252 --> 14:25.485
(Chuckles)

14:25.503 --> 14:27.170
What am I gonna say to him?

14:27.205 --> 14:28.655
(Exhales)
I don't know.

14:28.673 --> 14:30.340
Tell him you have a boyfriend.

14:30.374 --> 14:32.425
(Clicks tongue) Where am I
supposed to get a boyfriend?

14:32.460 --> 14:35.545
(Leaf blower whirring)

14:44.305 --> 14:46.506
(Pants)
Sam!

14:46.524 --> 14:48.141
Guess who just called me.

14:48.175 --> 14:49.226
Who?

14:49.277 --> 14:50.727
Benny Soto.

14:52.446 --> 14:55.198
Do you like Gloria Estefan,
Enrique Iglesias?

14:55.233 --> 14:56.700
Yeah.

14:56.734 --> 14:58.451
He's their producer.
And he wants to meet with me.

14:58.486 --> 15:00.537
Wow. That's... huge.

15:00.571 --> 15:01.872
You have no idea.

15:01.906 --> 15:03.406
I sent out
like a hundred demos.

15:03.457 --> 15:04.708
This is my first "yes."

15:04.742 --> 15:06.126
(Singsongy)
And it's Barry freakin' Soto!

15:06.160 --> 15:07.360
(Laughs)

15:07.378 --> 15:09.546
He wants to meet with me
tomorrow at noon.

15:09.580 --> 15:11.498
Congratulations.
(Chuckles)

15:11.532 --> 15:15.585
So I was thinking maybe
you can drive me there.

15:15.636 --> 15:17.420
What?

15:17.471 --> 15:19.389
You know, in the car.

15:19.423 --> 15:22.309
First of all,
this is not a car.

15:22.343 --> 15:23.476
It's a Rolls-Royce.

15:23.511 --> 15:26.045
And second of all, no.

15:26.063 --> 15:27.647
It's all the way across town.
Come on, Sam.

15:27.682 --> 15:29.266
I can't take a bus.
(Sighs)

15:29.317 --> 15:30.717
Sure, then on the way home,

15:30.735 --> 15:32.269
we can stop
at the unemployment office,

15:32.320 --> 15:36.156
because when Odessa finds out,
she's gonna fire my ass.

15:36.190 --> 15:39.075
Ugh!

15:39.110 --> 15:41.278
(Object clatters)

15:43.197 --> 15:46.533
(Singsongy)
Sam...

15:46.567 --> 15:49.202
(Normal voice) What if I did
go to dinner with you?

15:51.756 --> 15:53.924
Didn't you just tell me you'd
never go on a date with me

15:53.958 --> 15:56.075
because it would ruin
your life?

15:56.093 --> 15:58.094
Well, in my defense,
when I said that,

15:58.129 --> 16:00.046
I didn't need anything
from you.

16:00.080 --> 16:03.082
So you admit
you're just using me.

16:03.100 --> 16:04.684
<i>Yes.</i>

16:04.719 --> 16:07.470
(Exhales deeply)

16:07.521 --> 16:09.756
We should leave by 11:00
to beat the traffic.

16:09.774 --> 16:11.391
Aah! Thank you!

16:11.425 --> 16:13.727
(Carmen laughs)

16:16.864 --> 16:19.232
So we don't know
how she found out

16:19.266 --> 16:21.618
or if she's told anyone else.

16:21.652 --> 16:23.987
All we can be sure of
is that Olivia is now aware

16:24.038 --> 16:28.074
of your wife's...
former profession.

16:30.161 --> 16:31.244
We're going to move.

16:34.165 --> 16:35.281
What?

16:35.299 --> 16:36.616
My law firm has an office
in New York.

16:36.634 --> 16:38.335
They will make room for me.

16:38.386 --> 16:41.120
But we don't know
anyone in New York.

16:41.138 --> 16:42.555
Exactly.

16:42.590 --> 16:45.508
I don't want to leave L.A.
All my friends are here.

16:45.559 --> 16:48.311
Friends? What friends?

16:48.346 --> 16:50.630
Well, you know.
Everyone at the country club.

16:50.648 --> 16:52.148
They're really not our friends.

16:52.183 --> 16:54.067
They're only nice to us
because I'm a successful lawyer

16:54.101 --> 16:55.568
and you're my glamorous wife.

16:55.603 --> 16:58.405
Once they find out the truth,
that is all going to change.

16:58.439 --> 17:00.023
Honey...

17:00.074 --> 17:03.526
I'm not trying to hurt you.
I'm trying to protect you.

17:05.311 --> 17:07.329
Mr. Stafford,

17:07.365 --> 17:08.865
you have every right
to be upset,

17:08.915 --> 17:10.700
but you can't pack up
and leave the state

17:10.751 --> 17:12.419
because a few people
might gossip.

17:12.453 --> 17:14.371
Oh, so I should wait to
make sure they're gossiping?

17:14.422 --> 17:15.839
I don't think so.

17:15.873 --> 17:18.491
Marisol isn't nice to me
because you're successful.

17:18.509 --> 17:20.377
She's my friend.

17:20.428 --> 17:21.627
I need her.

17:23.714 --> 17:26.516
Fine.
We'll take her with us.

17:26.550 --> 17:28.935
- Wait. Hold on.
- Well, what is the problem?

17:28.970 --> 17:30.520
You told us you don't have
any family here.

17:30.554 --> 17:32.272
Yeah, but I-I...

17:32.306 --> 17:34.190
Well, I'll make it worth
your while. Don't you worry.

17:34.225 --> 17:37.477
Now I want both of you to start
packing tomorrow morning.

17:37.511 --> 17:39.813
We are leaving Beverly Hills.

17:48.259 --> 17:51.928
Hey, Zoila. Does Valentina have
a really good sewing machine?

17:51.962 --> 17:53.463
Why?

17:53.481 --> 17:55.098
Well, I wanted
to get her something.

17:55.132 --> 17:58.685
You know, for helping me
pack up and everything.

18:00.154 --> 18:02.072
You don't need
to buy her anything.

18:02.106 --> 18:03.807
No, I want to,

18:03.825 --> 18:05.859
and I know she likes
to make her own clothes, so...

18:05.910 --> 18:08.161
It's her job to help you.

18:08.196 --> 18:09.663
Yeah, but I...

18:09.697 --> 18:11.331
Remi, I really need
to finish the floors.

18:11.365 --> 18:12.866
Okay?

18:15.169 --> 18:18.872
Sure. Sorry.

18:22.710 --> 18:25.328
Did you send Valentina
to U.S.C.?

18:25.346 --> 18:27.798
Maybe.

18:27.832 --> 18:31.218
Why would you do that?

18:31.269 --> 18:33.470
Valentina came to me.

18:33.504 --> 18:36.339
She told me how she feels
about Remi...

18:36.357 --> 18:41.010
How she's loved him
all these years from afar.

18:41.028 --> 18:42.345
It's so romantic.

18:42.380 --> 18:44.047
So the two of you
went behind my back?

18:44.081 --> 18:48.151
Well, isn't that just great?

18:48.185 --> 18:51.154
But she really loves him.
I can tell.

18:51.189 --> 18:52.405
I don't care!

18:52.456 --> 18:54.291
Why are you being this way?

18:54.325 --> 18:57.994
Because I don't want to see
my daughter's heart get broken.

18:58.028 --> 19:01.047
You know Remi.
He would never do that.

19:01.082 --> 19:03.049
What I know
is that boys with money

19:03.084 --> 19:05.218
don't end up with the maid.

19:05.253 --> 19:07.170
<i>And you know that, too.</i>

19:08.639 --> 19:11.174
You can't still be
holding on to that.

19:11.208 --> 19:13.042
After all these years?

19:13.060 --> 19:15.011
He made promises to me.

19:15.045 --> 19:18.849
And, yes, I remember
every single one.

19:18.883 --> 19:21.217
He met someone else.

19:21.235 --> 19:23.770
You know
that sort of thing happens.

19:23.821 --> 19:26.356
Well, it's not gonna happen
to my daughter.

19:26.390 --> 19:29.576
Please tell Remi he is not
to go near Valentina.

19:29.610 --> 19:31.394
He's starting
to really like her.

19:31.412 --> 19:33.864
How can I say that to him?

19:33.898 --> 19:35.081
(Inhales)

19:35.116 --> 19:37.167
Valentina and I
will not be coming to work

19:37.201 --> 19:38.785
for the next few days.

19:40.454 --> 19:43.790
That should give you plenty
of time to think of something.

19:52.249 --> 19:55.135
Do you have a moment?

19:55.186 --> 19:56.970
Uh... sure.

19:57.021 --> 19:58.221
What's on your mind?

19:58.255 --> 20:01.057
(Papers rustle)

20:01.091 --> 20:02.142
(Exhales)

20:02.193 --> 20:03.476
I can't move to New York.

20:03.527 --> 20:04.861
Why not?

20:04.896 --> 20:06.062
Personal reasons.

20:06.096 --> 20:07.364
Well, what are they?
Perhaps I can help.

20:07.398 --> 20:08.949
And I'm sorry, but...

20:08.983 --> 20:11.234
Like I said, they're personal.

20:11.268 --> 20:13.653
Well,
Taylor will be heartbroken.

20:13.704 --> 20:17.207
She's really...
come to depend upon you.

20:17.241 --> 20:19.960
And I've become
very fond of her.

20:19.994 --> 20:22.379
More than I expected to.

20:22.413 --> 20:25.114
She is special, isn't she?

20:25.132 --> 20:27.918
She is.

20:27.952 --> 20:31.471
<i>Well, that is why I have to
get her out of here</i>

20:31.505 --> 20:33.122
before she becomes
the main course

20:33.140 --> 20:36.843
for the ladies who lunch.

20:38.462 --> 20:40.430
Before anyone starts packing,

20:40.464 --> 20:42.298
let me talk to Olivia.

20:42.316 --> 20:44.434
What good would that do?

20:44.468 --> 20:45.936
I could learn a few things...

20:45.970 --> 20:47.320
how she found out,

20:47.355 --> 20:51.608
if she plans on telling
anyone else.

20:51.642 --> 20:54.444
And why would Olivia
talk to you?

20:54.478 --> 20:56.579
She's a bitterly divorced woman.

20:56.614 --> 21:01.368
Trust me.
They'll talk to anyone.

21:03.487 --> 21:05.505
I've decided to move here.

21:05.539 --> 21:07.490
To Los Angeles?
Are you serious?

21:07.508 --> 21:10.043
I only moved to Savannah
because of Sheila.

21:10.094 --> 21:11.327
Now that we're divorced...

21:11.345 --> 21:13.096
I'm absolutely thrilled.

21:13.130 --> 21:15.682
Think of all the decadent
dinners we'll have.

21:15.716 --> 21:18.051
In fact,
what are you doing tonight?

21:18.102 --> 21:21.554
Adrian's introducing me
to someone.

21:21.605 --> 21:23.023
A woman?

21:23.057 --> 21:24.107
Yes.

21:24.141 --> 21:25.508
Oh.

21:25.526 --> 21:28.311
Was that insensitive of me
to mention another woman?

21:28.345 --> 21:29.846
No.
(Chuckles)

21:29.864 --> 21:33.316
We're friends.
We should be able to talk.

21:33.350 --> 21:35.351
Friends.

21:35.369 --> 21:37.454
There was a time when we
could've been more than that,

21:37.488 --> 21:38.521
but you chose Adrian.

21:38.539 --> 21:40.323
<i>After you chose Sheila.</i>

21:40.357 --> 21:44.027
(Sighs) As you know, I came
to regret my choice.

21:44.045 --> 21:46.296
(Sighs)

21:46.330 --> 21:48.048
Do you ever regret yours?

21:49.633 --> 21:51.200
(Sighs)
On second thought,

21:51.218 --> 21:53.219
I don't think you should move
to Los Angeles.

21:53.254 --> 21:55.505
Why not?

21:55.539 --> 21:58.425
This city changes people.

21:58.476 --> 22:02.045
<i>And I like you...</i>

22:02.063 --> 22:04.431
just the way you are.

22:04.482 --> 22:06.349
I don't think you need
to worry about me.

22:06.383 --> 22:08.068
After all these years,
I know exactly who I am.

22:08.102 --> 22:09.686
Well, you just remember that

22:09.720 --> 22:13.222
when you meet this friend
of Adrian's.

22:13.240 --> 22:17.243
You never answered my question.

22:17.278 --> 22:20.196
Do you regret choosing Adrian?

22:21.665 --> 22:24.200
What does it matter?

22:24.234 --> 22:27.120
He is what I deserve.

22:29.507 --> 22:32.008
Yeah. There you go.

22:32.043 --> 22:34.210
Hello, Mr. Spence.

22:34.244 --> 22:36.346
Hi, Rosie.

22:36.380 --> 22:37.514
Hello, uh...

22:37.548 --> 22:39.415
Raul. He's your gardener.

22:39.433 --> 22:42.385
Of course. Raul.

22:42.419 --> 22:44.137
I love your work.

22:44.188 --> 22:45.438
What's up?

22:45.473 --> 22:47.223
I gave the money to my lawyer,

22:47.257 --> 22:49.109
and everything is going
really good.

22:49.143 --> 22:52.562
So we wanted to take a minute
and thank you proper.

22:52.596 --> 22:54.697
We?

22:54.732 --> 22:57.400
Yes.
Raul is my boyfriend.

23:00.488 --> 23:02.655
Oh. I, uh, I...
I didn't know that.

23:02.706 --> 23:05.291
Oh, yes.
For many months now.

23:05.326 --> 23:08.745
We are very happy.
(Laughs)

23:08.779 --> 23:11.614
Well, congratulations.

23:11.632 --> 23:12.966
Thanks.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.618
So Raul has a favor to ask you,

23:15.636 --> 23:17.754
and he means no disrespect.

23:17.788 --> 23:20.123
(Sighs)
What is it?

23:20.141 --> 23:22.342
He saw you hug me yesterday,

23:22.393 --> 23:24.394
and he'd prefer
you don't do that anymore

23:24.428 --> 23:28.314
because it makes him, uh,
what is the English word?

23:28.349 --> 23:29.399
Jealous?

23:29.433 --> 23:32.235
Violent.

23:32.269 --> 23:35.805
I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

23:35.823 --> 23:37.490
Oh, no.
You don't gotta worry.

23:37.525 --> 23:39.275
He's a teddy bear.

23:39.309 --> 23:42.362
You know,
underneath the violent.

23:42.413 --> 23:45.365
Let's go.

23:53.356 --> 23:58.494
<i>♪ 'Cause I want you</i>

23:58.512 --> 24:00.630
<i>♪ ay, ohh</i>

24:00.664 --> 24:03.516
<i>♪ oh, oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

24:03.551 --> 24:04.717
(Turns off music)

24:04.768 --> 24:06.219
So I was gonna try
to put the hook

24:06.270 --> 24:08.354
back in at the end again
if you think that's a good idea.

24:08.389 --> 24:10.106
I do.

24:10.141 --> 24:13.476
So tell me, what part
of Puerto Rico are you from?

24:13.510 --> 24:14.611
Wh...

24:14.645 --> 24:16.062
Oh, come on.
(Chuckles)

24:16.113 --> 24:17.847
The accent is distinctive.

24:17.865 --> 24:19.182
Oh, okay.

24:19.200 --> 24:20.683
I produced an album
in San Juan.

24:20.701 --> 24:22.068
You've been to the island?

24:22.119 --> 24:23.620
Many times.
(Gasps)

24:23.654 --> 24:25.188
It's a hotbed of talent.

24:25.206 --> 24:27.407
Well... obviously.

24:27.458 --> 24:29.159
Thank you.

24:29.193 --> 24:31.161
Mm. Listen, Carmen,

24:31.195 --> 24:33.079
you definitely got some skills.

24:33.130 --> 24:35.248
But you're
a little underproduced.

24:35.299 --> 24:36.749
The good thing is,

24:36.800 --> 24:38.668
I can fix that.

24:38.702 --> 24:40.336
<i>Ay, Benny.
(Laughs)</i>

24:40.370 --> 24:42.371
You don't know what it means
for me to hear you say that.

24:42.389 --> 24:43.556
<i>But can I keep it real
with you?</i>

24:43.591 --> 24:45.058
Yes, of course.

24:45.092 --> 24:46.392
If you're gonna
sing in English,

24:46.427 --> 24:48.428
you gotta get rid
of this accent.

24:48.479 --> 24:50.546
I know it's funny for me
to say that,

24:50.564 --> 24:51.814
but that's the audience.

24:51.849 --> 24:54.484
<i>Americans... they like Latinas</i>

24:54.518 --> 24:57.520
<i>as long as they're not
too Latin.</i>

24:57.554 --> 24:59.322
And how do I do that?

24:59.356 --> 25:00.657
Practice...

25:00.691 --> 25:04.527
When you sing, when you talk,
when you breathe,

25:04.561 --> 25:06.446
every chance you get.

25:06.497 --> 25:09.499
Then whatever I have to do,
I'm gonna do it.

25:09.533 --> 25:11.751
Good to know.

25:11.785 --> 25:13.620
Well, I think
we're in business.

25:13.671 --> 25:15.071
Oh, my God.
(Laughs)

25:15.089 --> 25:16.422
(Chuckles) Let's get some lunch.
Celebrate.

25:16.457 --> 25:17.573
I'd love to.

25:17.591 --> 25:18.675
You like Cuban food?

25:18.709 --> 25:19.876
Bring on the croquetas.

25:19.910 --> 25:21.410
(Chuckles)

25:21.428 --> 25:22.629
Let me call the valet.

25:22.680 --> 25:24.297
They take forever
to get the car.

25:24.348 --> 25:26.415
Oh, relax.
We'll take mine.

25:26.433 --> 25:28.601
Mm.

25:30.221 --> 25:31.688
(Speaks indistinctly)

25:31.722 --> 25:33.439
Whoa.

25:33.474 --> 25:35.758
It belongs to a friend.
Sam.

25:35.776 --> 25:38.778
I want you to meet
Benny Soto, my new producer.

25:38.812 --> 25:40.647
Hey, that's great.

25:40.698 --> 25:42.198
Nice to meet you, Sam.

25:42.233 --> 25:44.567
Head east on Sunset,
then I'll direct you.

25:46.620 --> 25:48.271
(Lowered voice)
What's going on?

25:48.289 --> 25:50.573
I'm so sorry. It won't be long.
Just a quick lunch.

25:50.607 --> 25:51.741
That wasn't the deal.

25:51.775 --> 25:53.409
Sam, please don't blow this
for me.

25:53.443 --> 25:55.495
That's my future in there.

25:55.546 --> 25:57.964
(Giggles)

26:04.838 --> 26:06.589
I really want to thank you,
Benny.

26:06.623 --> 26:08.424
Oh, no problem.

26:08.458 --> 26:10.560
You know, when I first started
in this business,

26:10.594 --> 26:13.563
I promised myself,
if I ever made it to the top,

26:13.597 --> 26:15.798
I would send the elevator
back down.

26:15.816 --> 26:18.301
(Chuckles) Well,
I won't disappoint you.

26:18.319 --> 26:20.436
I know.

26:20.470 --> 26:22.522
I know you won't.

26:38.372 --> 26:39.488
My man,

26:39.506 --> 26:41.758
can we turn left
at the light here?

26:41.792 --> 26:44.010
We're gonna
stop by my place first.

26:46.930 --> 26:48.631
Carmen?

26:51.302 --> 26:54.971
You heard him.
Left at the light.

27:05.285 --> 27:07.653
(Door creaks)

27:07.687 --> 27:10.856
Where is East L.A. anyway?

27:10.874 --> 27:12.524
Well, you know when we're
on the freeway

27:12.542 --> 27:13.859
and you make me speed up?

27:13.877 --> 27:16.329
That neighborhood?

27:16.363 --> 27:18.030
Oh, goodness.

27:18.048 --> 27:19.799
You sure you don't want me
to go with you?

27:19.833 --> 27:22.668
This is between me and Zoila.

27:22.702 --> 27:25.504
I owe her an apology,

27:25.538 --> 27:28.224
and I've gotta deliver it
like a big girl.

27:28.258 --> 27:30.309
In 20 years, I never heard
you guys fight like that.

27:30.344 --> 27:32.094
What did you do?

27:33.563 --> 27:36.315
A long time ago,
before you were born,

27:36.350 --> 27:39.735
Zoila had a relationship
with my brother.

27:39.770 --> 27:41.821
Uncle Henri and Zoila?

27:41.855 --> 27:45.241
But when Henri
met Aunt Cynthia,

27:45.275 --> 27:49.278
a woman from...
a similar background,

27:49.329 --> 27:51.831
Zoila had her heart broken.

27:51.865 --> 27:54.367
And apparently,
she's never gotten over it.

27:54.401 --> 27:57.169
So when she sees me
and Valentina

27:57.204 --> 27:59.121
hanging out together...

27:59.172 --> 28:01.707
She's worried history
will repeat itself.

28:04.428 --> 28:05.744
(Car door opens)

28:05.762 --> 28:08.631
So what exactly is it
you have to apologize for?

28:10.583 --> 28:14.887
I'm the one who introduced
Cynthia to Henri.

28:17.557 --> 28:18.474
(Car door closes)

28:18.525 --> 28:20.810
(Hissing)

28:20.861 --> 28:23.446
You're not really dating
the gardener, are you?

28:23.480 --> 28:24.613
What?

28:24.648 --> 28:25.731
Raul's close to 60.

28:25.765 --> 28:27.599
He's got a wife and kids.

28:27.617 --> 28:29.785
Now I'm not dumb.

28:31.154 --> 28:33.706
No. Raul and I
are not dating.

28:33.740 --> 28:37.159
Rosie... why would you
lie to me?

28:37.210 --> 28:41.464
Well, the other day
when you hugged me...

28:41.498 --> 28:44.450
Oh, my God.
You didn't feel my...

28:44.468 --> 28:45.634
I did.

28:45.669 --> 28:47.053
Oh, I am so embarrassed.

28:47.087 --> 28:48.888
No, you have nothing
to be embarrassed about.

28:48.922 --> 28:50.806
(Clenches teeth)
God has been very good to you.

28:50.841 --> 28:52.258
I did not mean
for that to happen.

28:52.292 --> 28:55.561
It's just that you're
so kind and warm and...

28:55.595 --> 28:57.813
And it's been so long
since Peri and I...

28:57.848 --> 29:00.683
- My body responded.
- It's okay.

29:00.734 --> 29:02.601
And I'm sorry for lying.

29:02.635 --> 29:05.738
I just needed to make sure
you didn't have any...

29:05.772 --> 29:09.141
you know, expectations.

29:09.159 --> 29:11.744
No, none. I know
that's not a possibility.

29:11.778 --> 29:13.579
Again, I...

29:13.613 --> 29:15.314
I apologize.

29:15.332 --> 29:16.449
(Sighs)

29:18.368 --> 29:19.785
It was never my intention

29:19.819 --> 29:23.372
for you to know
how I feel about you.

29:28.929 --> 29:30.963
<i>(Man) ♪ Fight for survival,

29:30.997 --> 29:33.466

29:36.002 --> 29:38.070
(Turns music off)
Excuse me.

29:40.507 --> 29:43.976
I'm looking for my friend
Zoila Diaz.

29:44.010 --> 29:48.314
She lives on this block, but I
can't remember which house.

29:50.650 --> 29:52.651
Do you know her?

29:52.685 --> 29:54.820
She's Latino.

29:57.741 --> 29:59.792
Well, no worries.

29:59.826 --> 30:02.912
I'm sure I'll find her.

30:02.963 --> 30:05.548
(Clicks)
Enjoy your party.

All I'm saying is, you don't
walk out on your boss.

30:11.805 --> 30:13.839
Well, you weren't there.
You don't know what happened.

30:13.873 --> 30:15.007
Then tell me.

30:15.041 --> 30:17.343
I don't want to talk about it.

30:19.712 --> 30:22.515
(Siren wailing)

30:37.564 --> 30:38.697
Zoila!

30:38.731 --> 30:40.533
Are you home?

30:41.835 --> 30:44.036
Zoila!

30:45.539 --> 30:46.839
Zoila!

30:46.873 --> 30:48.774
I know you're in there.

30:48.809 --> 30:50.543
Isn't that Miss Genevieve?

30:55.465 --> 30:56.966
Zoila!

30:58.585 --> 30:59.768
(Barking)

30:59.803 --> 31:02.471
Aah!

31:02.522 --> 31:04.473
Oh, God!

31:06.560 --> 31:08.894
(Doorbell rings)

31:11.481 --> 31:12.565
Marisol.

31:12.599 --> 31:13.949
I'm sorry to bother you.

31:13.984 --> 31:15.868
This letter came to the house
a few days ago.

31:15.902 --> 31:17.620
It's addressed to you.

31:17.654 --> 31:19.788
Oh, it's just
some promotional thing.

31:19.823 --> 31:20.772
It's not important.

31:20.790 --> 31:22.408
I wasn't sure.

31:22.442 --> 31:24.776
You won't tell Taylor
I stopped by, will you?

31:24.794 --> 31:26.378
Of course not.

31:26.413 --> 31:28.780
Some mail still comes
to the house for you.

31:28.798 --> 31:31.500
I try to save it,
but she makes me throw it away.

31:31.551 --> 31:33.969
If she knew I brought
something for you,

31:34.004 --> 31:36.455
she would just scream at me.

31:36.473 --> 31:38.974
Taylor screams at you?

31:39.009 --> 31:41.810
She has become
this crazy nightmare.

31:43.647 --> 31:46.465
To tell you the truth...

31:46.483 --> 31:48.601
I don't know
how much more I can take.

31:50.820 --> 31:52.638
Would you like some tea?

31:52.656 --> 31:55.024
Yeah.

31:58.645 --> 32:02.831
(Siren wailing)

32:02.866 --> 32:04.533
How's your mom?

32:04.584 --> 32:06.151
Well, she says she's dying.

32:06.169 --> 32:08.504
The doctor says she has
a sprained wrist.

32:08.538 --> 32:10.656
I wonder who we should believe.

32:10.674 --> 32:12.541
So she's okay.

32:12.592 --> 32:14.510
Good.

32:16.162 --> 32:18.664
Did you know our moms
got into a fight today?

32:18.682 --> 32:21.800
Mine just told me we were
taking a few days off.

32:21.834 --> 32:23.602
She didn't say why.

32:23.637 --> 32:26.138
I think maybe your mom's upset
that we're getting so close.

32:26.172 --> 32:28.724
Well, I'm not.

32:28.775 --> 32:30.526
I like spending time with you.

32:30.560 --> 32:32.111
Me too.

32:32.145 --> 32:33.812
You know, for a minute there

32:33.846 --> 32:35.981
I really thought
this was going somewhere.

32:37.784 --> 32:40.119
And... now?

32:40.153 --> 32:43.539
Come on. You know how much
my mom needs your mom.

32:43.573 --> 32:45.691
And if us hanging out
all the time

32:45.709 --> 32:47.993
is causing this much tension
between them,

32:48.027 --> 32:51.080
maybe we should just cool it.

32:52.666 --> 32:54.917
Oh.

32:54.968 --> 32:57.419
Okay.

32:59.038 --> 33:00.706
Still buds, though, right?

33:00.724 --> 33:03.892
Sure.

33:03.927 --> 33:06.512
Good.

33:13.886 --> 33:15.938
So why don't you just quit?

33:15.989 --> 33:17.556
I've thought about it.

33:17.574 --> 33:20.058
But now it looks like
I won't have to.

33:20.076 --> 33:22.911
You see, Taylor is trying
to convince Michael

33:22.946 --> 33:24.613
to move to New York.

33:24.664 --> 33:25.914
New York?

33:25.949 --> 33:27.283
She thinks you're gonna

33:27.334 --> 33:29.067
tell the whole town
about her past,

33:29.085 --> 33:30.919
and she is scared to death.

33:30.954 --> 33:33.539
Ha! She should be.
(Chuckles)

33:33.573 --> 33:37.075
Of course,
she deserves what she gets,

33:37.093 --> 33:40.746
but it might be better for you
if they don't leave town.

33:40.764 --> 33:42.715
How so?

33:42.749 --> 33:44.433
Mrs. Stafford...
(Sets cup down)

33:44.467 --> 33:47.136
<i>I think Michael
is still in love with you.</i>

33:47.187 --> 33:49.221
He has a funny way
of showing it.

33:49.255 --> 33:51.607
Leaving me for Hooker Barbie?

33:51.641 --> 33:52.725
But I watch him.

33:52.759 --> 33:54.426
He's always talking about you.

33:54.444 --> 33:56.762
He's always looking
at pictures of you.

33:56.780 --> 33:58.096
Really?

33:58.114 --> 34:01.033
He's starting to realize
he made a mistake.

34:01.067 --> 34:04.069
But, you know, if they
leave town, move to New York,

34:04.103 --> 34:05.904
well, you know how it is.

34:05.938 --> 34:08.607
Out of sight, out of mind.

34:08.625 --> 34:10.492
(Sighs)

34:12.245 --> 34:14.079
I'm gonna write Taylor
a letter.

34:14.112 --> 34:16.614
Oh?

34:16.632 --> 34:18.949
I'll promise that I won't
tell anyone what I know.

34:18.967 --> 34:20.335
I'll say it's because of

34:20.387 --> 34:22.670
my deep and continuing
affection for Michael.

34:22.722 --> 34:24.005
And I'll give her the letter.

34:24.056 --> 34:25.841
Oh, no. (Scoffs)
Not her.

34:25.891 --> 34:29.127
You give it to him
so he knows how I feel.

34:29.145 --> 34:31.813
- Oh, that is brilliant.
- Ahh.

34:31.848 --> 34:33.065
(Chuckles)

34:33.099 --> 34:35.801
Unless someone else
knows about Taylor's past.

34:35.819 --> 34:38.654
If word gets out,
they'll still move.

34:38.688 --> 34:40.138
Nobody else knows.

34:40.156 --> 34:41.973
How did you find out?

34:41.991 --> 34:44.025
Evelyn Powell told me.

34:44.077 --> 34:46.745
How does Evelyn know?

34:46.780 --> 34:49.581
Oh, it was her husband
who first hired Taylor.

34:49.616 --> 34:51.750
Adrian hired Taylor?

34:51.784 --> 34:54.085
He propositioned her while she
was working in some diner.

34:54.120 --> 34:56.004
Apparently, he does
that sort of thing.

34:56.039 --> 34:57.840
Wait. I'm confused.

34:57.874 --> 35:00.793
Adrian Powell uses prostitutes?

35:00.827 --> 35:02.661
Oh. Not for himself.

35:02.679 --> 35:06.014
He gives them as gifts
to his friends.

35:06.049 --> 35:07.800
<i>What?</i>

35:07.834 --> 35:09.218
Yep.

35:09.269 --> 35:11.770
Evelyn calls it
his disgusting little hobby.

35:11.805 --> 35:14.973
He brings those women
right into their house.

35:15.007 --> 35:16.308
That's how Evelyn
first met Taylor

35:16.342 --> 35:19.010
and that girl who got murdered.

35:19.028 --> 35:21.363
Flora Hernandez.

35:21.398 --> 35:22.848
Oh, yes.

35:22.866 --> 35:24.566
In addition to being
their maid,

35:24.617 --> 35:28.704
Flora was also Adrian's whore.

35:38.683 --> 35:41.018
(Telephone rings)

35:42.553 --> 35:44.721
(Ring)

35:44.739 --> 35:45.889
(Beeps)

35:45.907 --> 35:48.058
Hello?

35:48.076 --> 35:49.910
No, I'm sorry.
She's asleep right now.

35:49.944 --> 35:52.279
Who, may I ask, is calling?

35:53.665 --> 35:57.334
Oh, Henri.

35:57.368 --> 36:00.587
I didn't recognize your voice.

36:00.622 --> 36:04.258
It's me. Zoila.

36:04.292 --> 36:08.295
(Laughs)
It's been a long time.

36:10.548 --> 36:13.300
How is she?

36:17.855 --> 36:19.890
Honestly?

36:21.776 --> 36:24.645
I'm worried about her.

36:24.696 --> 36:27.397
She's been through a lot.

36:27.431 --> 36:28.982
I think it would be a good idea

36:29.033 --> 36:33.103
if you... flew out
to see her.

36:33.121 --> 36:35.906
Really?

36:35.940 --> 36:39.943
That would be great.

36:39.961 --> 36:43.580
I know she's missed you...

36:43.614 --> 36:45.832
A lot.

36:45.883 --> 36:47.501
<i>(Dallas Raines) ...all the way
down into huntington beach</i>

36:47.552 --> 36:49.553
<i>for the highs only in the 70s.</i>

36:49.587 --> 36:51.088
<i>Here's the 7-day forecast.</i>

36:51.122 --> 36:52.639
<i>Tomorrow, a little fog

36:52.674 --> 36:54.124
(Clicks)

36:54.142 --> 36:56.510
(American accent)
Here's the 7-day forecast.

36:56.561 --> 36:59.980
Tomorrow, a little fog
at the beach.

37:01.433 --> 37:03.967
<i>And then a lot of clouds

37:03.985 --> 37:05.302
<i>and Thursday.
(Click)</i>

37:05.320 --> 37:07.571
And then a lot of clouds
start coming in

37:07.605 --> 37:09.356
- on Wednesday...
- Carmen?

37:09.407 --> 37:11.074
(Normal voice)
I'm busy.

37:11.109 --> 37:13.110
I know. It's just...

37:13.144 --> 37:15.645
I need to tell you something.
It's important.

37:15.663 --> 37:18.481
Okay.

37:18.499 --> 37:19.983
You are smart.

37:20.001 --> 37:21.868
And you are beautiful.

37:21.919 --> 37:25.956
And your music
is really amazing.

37:25.990 --> 37:28.592
You don't have to let men
like Benny Soto...

37:28.626 --> 37:29.760
Sam.

37:29.794 --> 37:31.494
It's a rough business.

37:31.512 --> 37:32.829
And I'm not 22 anymore.

37:32.847 --> 37:36.499
If I don't make it soon,
it's not gonna happen.

37:36.517 --> 37:38.635
But think of what
you're becoming.

37:38.669 --> 37:40.887
All for a couple
of gold records?

37:40.938 --> 37:42.672
Will it be worth it?

37:42.690 --> 37:45.508
When I get the gold records,

37:45.526 --> 37:47.644
I'll let you know.

37:47.678 --> 37:51.031
Wow.

37:51.065 --> 37:54.117
You are not the girl
I thought you were.

37:54.152 --> 37:55.685
I guess that means

37:55.703 --> 37:58.238
you don't want to go
to dinner with me anymore?

37:59.824 --> 38:01.742
No.

38:01.793 --> 38:03.710
I don't.

38:03.745 --> 38:06.246
It's okay.

38:08.549 --> 38:11.752
No.

38:11.803 --> 38:13.203
It's not.

38:13.221 --> 38:14.554
(Remote clicks)

38:14.589 --> 38:15.872
<i>Then for the weekend,</i>

38:15.890 --> 38:17.507
<i>the Santa Ana winds
start blowing,</i>

38:17.541 --> 38:19.926
<i>and the temperatures

38:19.977 --> 38:21.711

38:21.729 --> 38:23.397

the Santa Ana winds
are blowing,

38:25.716 --> 38:30.053
and the temperatures

38:35.243 --> 38:39.696

38:39.730 --> 38:42.999
So Olivia won't tell
anyone else?

38:43.034 --> 38:44.901
That's what she said.

38:44.919 --> 38:46.903
So... it's over?

38:46.921 --> 38:48.588
I think so.

38:48.623 --> 38:51.908
How in the world did you
get her to agree to this?

38:51.926 --> 38:53.927
Well, first I had to tell her
you were a bitch.

38:53.961 --> 38:55.262
(Gasps and laughs)

38:55.296 --> 38:56.513
Then everything
sort of fell into place.

38:56.547 --> 38:57.631
(Laughs)
Oh, wonderful.

38:57.682 --> 38:59.049
Now if you'll excuse me,

38:59.083 --> 39:00.967
I'm gonna tell Michael
we don't have to move.

39:01.018 --> 39:02.469
Well, before you do that,

39:02.520 --> 39:04.754
I need to ask you a favor.

39:04.772 --> 39:09.693
<i>Obviously, I am in the mood
to give you anything you want.</i>

39:09.727 --> 39:11.111
It's gonna sound odd,

39:11.145 --> 39:12.813
but I want to hear about

39:12.864 --> 39:15.782
Adrian Powell
and his prostitutes.

39:15.817 --> 39:18.318
Why?

39:18.369 --> 39:22.739
I need to understand
what is going on in that house.

39:27.745 --> 39:32.582
<i>(Taylor) Adrian calls them
"intimate get-togethers."</i>

39:32.616 --> 39:34.084
<i>And the guest list</i>

39:34.118 --> 39:38.955
<i>always includes
a beautiful young woman.</i>

39:38.973 --> 39:40.790
<i>She is then introduced</i>

39:40.808 --> 39:42.676
<i>to a middle-aged friend
of Adrian's</i>

39:42.727 --> 39:46.763
<i>who has no idea she's been
hired for the evening.</i>

39:46.797 --> 39:50.984
<i>This is followed up
with a little small talk</i>

39:51.018 --> 39:53.520
<i>and a lot of wine.</i>

39:53.571 --> 39:57.140
<i>After an hour or so,
a signal is given.</i>

39:57.158 --> 39:58.575
<i>The woman then suggests</i>

39:58.609 --> 40:01.828
<i>it's time
to take the party upstairs.</i>

40:01.863 --> 40:04.664
<i>Because Adrian's friend
is now drunk,</i>

40:04.699 --> 40:08.034
<i>it doesn't occur to him
to say no.</i>

40:08.085 --> 40:11.538
<i>(Carmen)
Does anyone know about this?</i>

40:11.589 --> 40:15.258
<i>I think Evelyn knows.</i>

40:15.293 --> 40:19.179
<i>And she's not happy about it.</i>

40:19.213 --> 40:23.666
<i>Where is Adrian
while all this is happening?</i>

40:23.684 --> 40:25.685
<i>That's the weird part.</i>

40:25.720 --> 40:28.271
<i>He just disappears.</i>

40:28.306 --> 40:31.608
This whole thing is bizarre.

40:31.642 --> 40:34.311
Isn't it, though?

40:34.345 --> 40:37.230
<i>So Adrian Powell
hires prostitutes</i>

40:37.281 --> 40:39.182
<i>to have sex with his friends,</i>

40:39.200 --> 40:42.185
<i>who have no idea
they're being set up.</i>

40:42.203 --> 40:43.987
<i>Exactly.</i>

40:44.021 --> 40:46.623
<i>But why?</i>

40:46.657 --> 40:49.960
<i>Why would he do this?</i>

40:49.994 --> 40:54.581
<i>What on earth
does Adrian get out of this?</i>
