You're finally up.

01:43.104 --> 01:45.170
Someone was snoring
the day away, lazybones.

01:45.172 --> 01:49.174
Mom, today is a day

or eggplant or meatballs.

02:25.446 --> 02:28.480
Listen, I did write about
someone in the family,

I am he, and he is me.

02:31.752 --> 02:34.887
Bevy, she clearly
picked someone else,

Relax.
We were just sniffing it.

Stand up and show me
your fingers.

Popcorn is the snack

No. It's a snack

Yeah,

Yeah, man.

08:04.351 --> 08:07.786
<i> ¶ Believe it or not</i>
<i> it's just me ¶</i>

08:07.788 --> 08:09.621
(MUSIC STOPS)
I take it back, okay?

08:09.623 --> 08:11.857
I take back
every single word I wrote.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.291
You think you can just
take it back

08:13.293 --> 08:15.494
like a bathing suit
you've worn three times

08:15.496 --> 08:16.995
with the tags tucked in?

08:16.997 --> 08:17.863
(LAUGHS)

08:17.865 --> 08:19.865
No way. I'm your hero.
No!

08:19.867 --> 08:23.134
Our history together
will show I think
you're the absolute worst.

08:23.136 --> 08:25.871
But now I'll forever know
how you really feel about me,

08:25.873 --> 08:31.009
which is,
"Everything my mother does
comes from her heart."

08:31.011 --> 08:33.345
Stop using my words
against me.

08:33.347 --> 08:34.312
You are not my hero.

08:34.314 --> 08:36.448
I read a document
that says otherwise.

08:36.450 --> 08:37.983
God, you ruin everything!

08:37.985 --> 08:40.685
And yet I'm your
"beacon on the hill."

08:40.687 --> 08:41.720
I resent you so much
right now.

08:41.722 --> 08:44.856
But yet you love me
"more than anyone."

08:44.858 --> 08:46.992
This is
"my worst nightmare."

08:46.994 --> 08:48.527
And it's my dream.
(CHUCKLES)

08:48.529 --> 08:50.996
Like the song says,
I'm walking on air.

08:50.998 --> 08:51.830
And I'm walking out.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.598
ADULT ADAM:
<i> As Erica's secret was out,</i>

08:53.600 --> 08:55.400
<i> Barry and I were</i>
<i> launching a secret plan</i>

08:55.402 --> 08:56.968
<i> that would change everything.</i>

08:56.970 --> 08:59.971
Young Adam, we have been
given a gift.

08:59.973 --> 09:04.476
We have seen with
our very eyes
the underbelly of our enemy.

09:04.478 --> 09:05.076
Dad?
Yes!

09:05.078 --> 09:08.847
The one who oppresses us
by ruling over the popcorn,

09:08.849 --> 09:11.016
temperature,
and remote control.

09:11.018 --> 09:13.318
He always makes me watch
<i> Hee Haw!</i>

09:13.320 --> 09:13.852
<i> Hee Haw,</i> Barry!

09:13.854 --> 09:16.821
We discovered something new
in that ice fort...

09:16.823 --> 09:18.323
That Dad's vulnerable.

09:18.325 --> 09:21.359
And when we mess with him,
it's super fun.

09:21.361 --> 09:22.627
I agree.
It was joyous.

09:22.629 --> 09:24.362
But we're back
in the house now.
It's over.

09:24.364 --> 09:27.599
Or do we continue
the good times
and laughter forever?

09:27.601 --> 09:29.267
You mean mess with Dad

09:29.269 --> 09:31.436
outside the whimsical world
of the snow fort?

09:31.438 --> 09:35.407
Of course! Now we know
he's all bark and no bite.

09:35.409 --> 09:37.142
I bet he doesn't even think
we're morons.

09:37.144 --> 09:38.443
But that's his hurtful
catchphrase.

09:38.445 --> 09:42.480
From this moment on,
I say we do the things
that annoy him

09:42.482 --> 09:43.715
and entertain us.

09:43.717 --> 09:44.916
Like sitting in his chair

09:44.918 --> 09:47.586
or leaving that last drop
in the orange juice container?

09:47.588 --> 09:50.322
Damn right!
It's a snow-day revolution!

09:50.324 --> 09:52.157
ADULT ADAM:
<i> And our first battle was this.</i>

09:52.159 --> 09:55.360
You two are grounded!
No telephone! No Atari!

09:55.362 --> 09:58.196
No robits!
Now get upstairs!

09:58.565 --> 10:00.198
Want to go sledding?
Sure.

10:00.200 --> 10:00.899
Sledding?

10:00.901 --> 10:02.233
Didn't you hear
what I just said?

10:02.235 --> 10:04.135
Oh, we heard it.
It's just... (CHUCKLES)

10:04.137 --> 10:06.004
we're gonna pass
on the grounding.

10:06.006 --> 10:08.106
(BOTH LAUGH)

10:08.275 --> 10:09.240
What the hell
just happened?

10:09.242 --> 10:12.110
ADULT ADAM:<i> What happened</i>
<i> was a revolution.</i>

10:13.380 --> 10:16.281
ADULT ADAM:<i> My brother and I</i>
<i> were in full rebellion mode,</i>

10:16.283 --> 10:17.882
<i> and we were ready</i>
<i> to take it up a notch.</i>

10:17.884 --> 10:22.153
Bevy! Where's my tin
of holiday popcorn?

10:22.155 --> 10:26.524
Looking for something? Mmm!
Flavored corn deliciousness.

10:26.526 --> 10:27.993
What have you done?

10:27.995 --> 10:28.927
Looks like you're not
the only one

10:28.929 --> 10:32.631
who can enjoy four types
of gourmet popcorn
whenever he wants.

10:32.633 --> 10:34.332
You better not have touched
white cheddar.

10:34.334 --> 10:36.534
Oh, I touched
the white cheddar but good.

10:36.536 --> 10:38.370
That quadrant
was for dads only!

10:38.372 --> 10:40.772
Seriously,
what's wrong with you?
Yo, Ad-rock!

10:40.774 --> 10:44.542
ADULT ADAM:<i> And then we went</i>
<i> where no Goldberg</i>
<i> had gone before.</i>

10:44.544 --> 10:46.444
You chilly? I sure am.

10:46.446 --> 10:48.179
Might as well just crank up
this bad boy.

10:48.181 --> 10:50.348
Hey, you know no one touches
that thermostat.

10:50.350 --> 10:54.719
It stays locked in
at a comfortable 63 degrees,
no higher!

10:54.721 --> 10:57.088
87... Temperature
of the rich.

10:57.090 --> 11:00.492
Eighty-seven degrees?
What do you think
this is, the sun?

11:00.494 --> 11:02.794
We reign over
the thermostat now.

11:02.796 --> 11:04.796
Okay, you saw me
at a low point,

11:04.798 --> 11:07.732
and now you're giving me
a taste of my own medicine.

11:07.734 --> 11:09.134
(MUFFLED) So good.

11:09.136 --> 11:10.869
Sweet and savory.

11:10.871 --> 11:13.238
Damn it, stop eating
all the caramel!

11:13.240 --> 11:13.738
No can do.

11:13.740 --> 11:16.341
You see, until now,
your main weapon
was dad rage,

11:16.343 --> 11:19.077
but that all changed
when your middle-aged body

11:19.079 --> 11:20.245
corked up
our snow tunnel.

11:20.247 --> 11:22.380
Nothing has changed,
nothing.

11:22.382 --> 11:23.882
(CHUCKLING)
Oh, it has.

11:23.884 --> 11:26.584
We went into that snow fort
as scared boys,

11:26.586 --> 11:28.953
but we emerged
as fearless men

11:28.955 --> 11:30.855
who now find
your anger silly.

11:30.857 --> 11:33.625
Fine. You don't want to
respect me? I'm out.

11:33.627 --> 11:37.629
I retire from being involved
in your lives in any way.

11:37.631 --> 11:39.464
Trust me,
there will be a time

11:39.466 --> 11:43.334
when you come to me
in desperate need
of your dad,

11:43.336 --> 11:44.069
and I won't help you.

11:44.071 --> 11:45.637
ADULT ADAM:<i> Our snow-day</i>
<i> rebellion had worked.</i>

11:45.639 --> 11:48.173
<i> The balance of power</i>
<i> had shifted in our house,</i>

11:48.175 --> 11:49.374
<i> and we were kings!</i>

11:49.376 --> 11:50.608
Dear God.
You were right.

11:50.610 --> 11:53.044
We can mess with dad
out of the snow fort, too.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.313
I feel so alive and sweaty
from the heat!

11:55.315 --> 11:58.183
This must be what the other
Adam Goldberg in school

11:58.185 --> 11:59.384
feels like all the time.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.953
He's a loose cannon and
lives on his own terms!

12:01.955 --> 12:05.023
Dude! Now we can finally
live our snow day

12:05.025 --> 12:07.559
the way the gods
of winter intended it!

12:07.561 --> 12:08.426
Car toboggan.

12:08.428 --> 12:10.161
It combines the fun
of water-skiing

12:10.163 --> 12:12.197
with the treacherous
danger of luge.

12:12.199 --> 12:13.398
I like what I'm hearing.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.399
Sit down and hold on

12:14.401 --> 12:17.102
'cause I'm gonna drive fast
and take chances.

12:17.104 --> 12:18.536
(ENGINE STARTS)

12:18.538 --> 12:20.205
Snow day!

12:21.441 --> 12:23.041
Life without a dad rules!

12:23.043 --> 12:25.210
ADULT ADAM:<i> As we set out on</i>
<i> our fatherless snow day,</i>

12:25.212 --> 12:28.680
<i> my sister was doing</i>
<i> everything she could</i>
<i> to avoid our mom.</i>

12:28.682 --> 12:29.814
Mom isn't down here,
is she?

12:29.816 --> 12:32.150
I haven't felt
her looming presence

12:32.152 --> 12:34.586
in over an hour,
so you're safe.

12:34.588 --> 12:35.086
Thank God.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.788
That woman finding out
that she's my hero

12:36.790 --> 12:39.424
is the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.058
Speaking of heroes,

12:40.060 --> 12:43.428
have I told you about
all my rich life adventures?

12:43.430 --> 12:44.162
Yes. Many times.

12:44.164 --> 12:46.331
I bet you didn't know
that after the army,

12:46.333 --> 12:48.767
I joined the USO
and entertained the troops

12:48.769 --> 12:50.702
with a death-defying
circus act.

12:50.704 --> 12:53.638
I need help, Pops,
not your old-man yarns.

12:53.640 --> 12:56.908
They're not yarns.
I trained a lion.

12:56.910 --> 12:58.376
His name was Stan.

12:58.378 --> 12:59.277
There you are, boopie.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.445
I need your
fashion expertise.

13:00.447 --> 13:03.982
Which iron-on should I put
on my purple jumpsuit,

13:03.984 --> 13:06.651
me as the wind
beneath your wings

13:06.653 --> 13:08.753
or we're two peas in a pod?

13:08.755 --> 13:09.320
Hmm. I pick none.

13:09.322 --> 13:12.457
Well, you go to pick one
so we can wear them
on our ski trip this weekend.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.926
Let's be clear,
I am going skiing
with Lainey

13:14.928 --> 13:17.529
and also 10 boys
who I know a little bit.

13:17.531 --> 13:18.329
And your hero.

13:18.331 --> 13:20.131
I'm sure you want me
to tag along.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.500
In what world
does that make sense?

13:22.502 --> 13:23.535
If Barry went on
a ski trip,

13:23.537 --> 13:25.470
he'd want to bring
his hero, Chuck Norris,

13:25.472 --> 13:27.772
and Adam would
definitely want to ski
with Crispin Glover.

13:27.774 --> 13:31.709
So it makes perfect sense
that you would want
to bring your hero, me.

13:31.711 --> 13:34.379
Okay, weird Crispin Glover
doesn't ski,

13:34.381 --> 13:36.881
and Chuck Norris likes
a desert climate,

13:36.883 --> 13:38.283
so you're not going.

13:38.285 --> 13:38.750
I get it.

13:38.752 --> 13:41.753
It's embarrassing
having your mom
as your hero.

13:41.755 --> 13:43.588
But don't worry,
I can be cool.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.890
Hang with the hunkos
in the bubbly tub

13:45.892 --> 13:48.493
with my ski gogs on.
(CLICKS TONGUE)

13:48.495 --> 13:49.861
Oh, my God.
I don't (GAGS)

13:49.863 --> 13:51.596
even know how
to respond to that.

13:51.598 --> 13:52.897
I know!
It's gonna be great!

13:52.899 --> 13:55.200
Just like when we carpool
to school together

13:55.202 --> 13:57.001
so we can have
a little gossip time.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.136
(GAGS) I just can't...

13:58.138 --> 13:59.504
And I'm gonna take you

13:59.506 --> 14:01.172
to my Friday-night
scrapbooking club

14:01.174 --> 14:04.576
so you can see how
your real hero cuts loose.

14:04.578 --> 14:05.810
(GAGS)

14:06.346 --> 14:07.145
Decoupage.

14:07.147 --> 14:08.279
So, let me get this straight.

14:08.281 --> 14:10.315
You being my hero
basically undoes

14:10.317 --> 14:11.816
everything good
in my life?

14:11.818 --> 14:13.618
Yay! We're gonna be
slope sisters.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.920
I got to go bedazzle
my ski boots.

14:16.823 --> 14:17.088
Ugh!

14:17.090 --> 14:19.624
Thinking you should have
picked a different hero,

14:19.626 --> 14:23.962
one who's literally
put his head
in a lion's mouth?

14:23.964 --> 14:25.663
Wait a minute.
You're right.

14:25.665 --> 14:27.031
I chose
to write about Mom,

14:27.033 --> 14:29.234
so I can just
write about someone else.

14:29.236 --> 14:30.501
Now we're talking.

14:30.503 --> 14:31.903
I'll write about myself,

14:31.905 --> 14:34.472
how I survived
my crazy "smother"

14:34.474 --> 14:35.306
and became my own hero.

14:35.308 --> 14:37.809
At this point,
very little surprises me.

14:37.811 --> 14:39.744
Thank you, Pops!
You are my hero!

14:39.746 --> 14:43.348
I mean,
for giving me the idea
to write about myself.

14:43.350 --> 14:44.949
You bet.

14:48.788 --> 14:50.421
(CHUCKLING) Oh, man!

14:50.423 --> 14:52.023
That was awesome!

14:52.025 --> 14:53.625
I know you don't
have your license,

14:53.627 --> 14:55.693
but it's your turn
to drive.

14:56.429 --> 14:57.762
Adam?

15:01.001 --> 15:01.232
Huh.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.601
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Turns out we would</i>
<i> need our dad</i>

15:03.603 --> 15:06.271
<i> just way sooner</i>
<i> than expected.</i>

15:06.273 --> 15:07.238
Fancy meeting you here.

15:07.240 --> 15:10.708
Good to see
you're keeping warm
on this wintry day, Father.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.043
Bup-bup.
Not the dad.

15:12.045 --> 15:14.946
(LAUGHS)
Hilarious as always.

15:14.948 --> 15:15.747
Speaking of funny stuff,

15:15.749 --> 15:18.049
do you recall when you told me
there would be a time

15:18.051 --> 15:19.951
I'd come to you
in desperate need?

15:19.953 --> 15:21.152
Well, that moment
is now upon us.

15:21.154 --> 15:23.922
Are you kidding?
It's been, what, 20 minutes?

15:23.924 --> 15:25.490
Time sure does fly,
doesn't it?

15:25.492 --> 15:27.058
Well, whatever you did,
it's on you.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.794
Yeah, you're teaching me
a lesson about respect.

15:29.796 --> 15:30.662
Noble goal.

15:30.664 --> 15:32.797
In return,
I'd like to teach you

15:32.799 --> 15:35.133
the highs and lows
of car tobogganing,

15:35.135 --> 15:38.069
the recreational pastime
that's sweeping the nation.

15:38.071 --> 15:39.203
What did you do?

15:39.205 --> 15:41.105
I lost Adam.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.141
Get my pants.

15:44.311 --> 15:47.312
There's my little
typer monkey.

15:47.314 --> 15:48.680
What you
click-clacking about?

15:48.682 --> 15:50.381
Got more to write
about your hero mama?

15:50.383 --> 15:53.685
Oh, just making a few tiny
tweaks to my college essay.

15:53.687 --> 15:54.085
Tweaks?

15:54.087 --> 15:56.354
Can't believe it gets
much better than that.

15:56.356 --> 15:57.121
Oh, it's better.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.456
My first tweak
was when I, like,

15:58.458 --> 16:01.292
threw the whole thing out
and started over.
What's that, now?

16:01.294 --> 16:03.428
Yeah, my new essay
is about my inner hero

16:03.430 --> 16:06.864
and how I overcame
the greatest obstacle
of all.

16:07.667 --> 16:08.266
Me?

16:08.268 --> 16:10.134
It says I'm the obstacle?
Yep.

16:10.136 --> 16:13.137
(GASPS) And ruiner of dreams?
For sure.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.772
Strangler of hope?
Yep.

16:14.774 --> 16:18.042
A vampire draining
your human sprite?

16:18.044 --> 16:21.479
Oopsie, that is supposed
to say "spirit."

16:21.481 --> 16:22.046
Good eye.

16:22.048 --> 16:25.249
Oh. This is about me
going on the ski trip.

16:25.251 --> 16:26.818
Okay, how's about
I just sit it out?

16:26.820 --> 16:28.453
Just please don't
send this in.

16:28.455 --> 16:29.053
And print.

16:29.055 --> 16:31.055
(PRINTER CLICKING)
Please stop that horrible
printing sound.

16:31.057 --> 16:35.093
I wish I could,
but I pressed the button,
and it can't be stopped.

16:35.095 --> 16:36.894
It can
if I drown it out.

16:37.797 --> 16:41.299
(BLENDER WHIRRING)
The blending stops
when the printing stops.

16:41.301 --> 16:43.067
You can blend
all you want, lady,

16:43.069 --> 16:45.370
but I'ma print
all day long.

16:45.372 --> 16:49.140
Beverly, Adam is lost
in the snow!

16:49.142 --> 16:50.208
It's an emergency!

16:50.210 --> 16:53.444
I can't hear you.
I'm proving a point.

16:55.915 --> 16:58.649
ADULT ADAM:
<i> My sister had finally finished</i>
<i> her new college essay</i>

16:58.651 --> 17:01.119
<i> about heroically triumphing</i>
<i> over her "smother,"</i>

17:01.121 --> 17:03.888
<i> but my mom had one last trick</i>
<i> up her snowsuit.</i>

17:03.890 --> 17:05.957
Where are you going?
Out.

17:05.959 --> 17:07.925
Where?
All of Philly's shut down.

17:07.927 --> 17:10.061
I'm gonna snowshoe over
to the Dress Barn

17:10.063 --> 17:12.397
and see about their
annual blizzard sale.

17:12.399 --> 17:14.565
Blizzard sale?
That's not a thing.

17:14.567 --> 17:15.333
Eat my dust, sucka.

17:15.335 --> 17:17.468
Penn State's gonna know
I'm your hero.

17:17.470 --> 17:19.003
Wait! Get back here!

17:19.005 --> 17:21.506
ADULT ADAM:
<i> But their race to the mailbox</i>
<i> didn't go as planned</i>

17:21.508 --> 17:23.708
<i> because we forgot</i>
<i> to shovel the driveway.</i>

17:23.710 --> 17:26.310
No! Do not take that
to the mailbox.

17:26.312 --> 17:26.978
Don't you dare.

17:26.980 --> 17:28.980
It's too late.
You'll never catch me.

17:28.982 --> 17:29.380
Get back here!

17:29.382 --> 17:32.617
ADULT ADAM:
<i> And so began the slowest</i>
<i> high-speed chase</i>

17:32.619 --> 17:33.518
<i> in Goldberg history.</i>

17:33.520 --> 17:34.852
I wrote a better,
more hurtful one.

17:34.854 --> 17:38.589
Those stupid sons of
bitches at Penn State
will never read it.

17:38.591 --> 17:41.225
Not if I beat you
to the mailbox, old lady.

17:41.227 --> 17:42.593
Ha! I'm pulling ahead!

17:42.595 --> 17:43.728
No, never!

17:43.730 --> 17:45.396
Oh! Oh!
Aah!

17:45.999 --> 17:48.633
(BOTH GRUNTING)

17:48.635 --> 17:52.170
You are not my hero!

17:52.172 --> 17:56.407
No! Erica,
that's all I had left,

17:56.409 --> 17:57.408
and you ruined it.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.477
Mom, it's just
a stupid college essay.

17:59.479 --> 18:01.612
Why make this
the biggest deal
in the world?

18:01.614 --> 18:04.415
That essay was
the only proof I had

18:04.417 --> 18:06.651
that you still want me
as your mom.

18:06.653 --> 18:08.052
Come on.
That's not true.

18:08.054 --> 18:10.388
Every day,
you roll your eyes at me

18:10.390 --> 18:12.256
and you tell me
I ruin your life.

18:12.258 --> 18:15.993
And I know you're a teenager,
and that's how it goes,

18:15.995 --> 18:17.628
but it hurts.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.363
And then
I read this essay.

18:19.365 --> 18:21.132
And it was just nice
to be reminded

18:21.134 --> 18:24.402
that you still
think nice things
about me sometimes.

18:24.404 --> 18:30.374
Look,
even though you have real
impulse-control problems,

18:30.376 --> 18:34.612
and you threw me down
on a sheet of ice,

18:34.614 --> 18:36.447
you shouldn't need
some essay to know

18:36.449 --> 18:40.218
that you really are my
(QUIETLY) hero.

18:40.220 --> 18:41.519
What was that?

18:41.521 --> 18:42.820
You're my stupid hero,
okay?

18:42.822 --> 18:44.255
<i> ¶ Look at what's</i>
<i> happened to me...</i>

18:44.257 --> 18:47.592
I know I don't say it,
but I would be lucky
to grow up

18:47.594 --> 18:51.696
to be as strong and confident
and passionate as you are.

18:51.698 --> 18:54.532
<i> ¶ Suddenly I'm up</i>
<i> on top of the world</i>
Oh, sweetie.

18:54.534 --> 18:57.201
You already are
all of those things.

18:57.203 --> 18:59.804
<i> ¶ It should've been</i>
<i> somebody else</i>

18:59.806 --> 19:03.708
<i> ¶ Believe it or not,</i>
<i> I'm walking on air</i>
I'm your hero.

19:03.710 --> 19:08.279
<i> ¶ I never thought</i>
<i> I could feel so free...</i>

19:08.281 --> 19:09.380
Dad?

19:09.382 --> 19:10.615
You okay?

19:10.617 --> 19:13.784
You were right.
Snow is nature's weapon.

19:13.786 --> 19:15.119
I kind of hurt my ankle.

19:15.121 --> 19:16.587
Come on.
I'll get you home safe.

19:16.589 --> 19:20.825
<i> ¶ Believe it or not,</i>
<i> it's just me</i>

(SNIFFLES)

19:21.561 --> 19:24.529
You're gonna yell at us
when we get home, aren't you?

19:24.531 --> 19:26.764
Oh, yeah.
Good.

19:26.766 --> 19:28.666
ADULT ADAM:
<i> That's the thing</i>
<i> about your heroes.</i>

19:28.668 --> 19:30.568
<i> Even when we say</i>
<i> we don't need them,</i>

19:30.570 --> 19:32.136
<i> they'd still have our backs.</i>

19:32.138 --> 19:35.573
<i> But every once in a while,</i>
<i> heroes need</i>
<i> a little love, too,</i>

19:35.575 --> 19:40.878
<i> or at least a reminder of</i>
<i> why they were so important</i>
<i> in the first place.</i>

19:40.880 --> 19:42.947
I think this
belongs to you.

19:42.949 --> 19:47.652
So does this.
I melted a Butterfinger
on some Jiffy Pop.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.687
Consider it our apology,

19:49.689 --> 19:52.223
you know,
'cause you're the dad

19:52.225 --> 19:53.224
and we like it that way.

19:53.226 --> 19:55.359
If you need us,
we'll be shoveling
the walkway

19:55.361 --> 19:56.794
like we should have done
in the first place.

19:56.796 --> 20:01.332
ADULT ADAM:<i> And with that,</i>
<i> our dad was back</i>
<i> to being our dad again.</i>

20:01.334 --> 20:02.133
<i> But that snow day,</i>

20:02.135 --> 20:04.569
<i> he realized there's much more</i>
<i> to being a father</i>

20:04.571 --> 20:06.671
<i> than enforcing the rules.</i>

20:06.673 --> 20:07.171
Hey!

20:07.173 --> 20:08.940
You snow babies
gonna fight back?

20:08.942 --> 20:09.540
<i> ¶ Believe it or not</i>

20:09.542 --> 20:12.577
ADULT ADAM:
<i> So, yeah, our snow day</i>
<i> didn't go as planned,</i>

20:12.579 --> 20:16.380
<i> but turns out,</i>
<i> it really was the day</i>
<i> we'd always hoped for.</i>

Take that, old man!

<i> ¶ Believe it or not,</i>
<i> I'm walking on air ¶</i>

20:19.419 --> 20:21.852
Oh, good.
The walkway's shoveled.

20:21.854 --> 20:23.254
Ooh!

20:23.256 --> 20:23.854
Oh!

Oh! You're gonna be
one sorry Schmoo!

20:29.028 --> 20:31.362
<i> and we were lobbing balls</i>
<i> of ice at each other,</i>

20:31.364 --> 20:34.098

I'm finally done with
that college essay.

You know, sweetheart,
it's not too late
to write about a real hero.

21:02.996 --> 21:04.595
Ship's kind of sailed
at this point.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.564
That ship might circle
back to port

21:06.566 --> 21:09.700
when you take a gander
at some circus adventures

21:09.702 --> 21:10.268
after the war.

21:10.270 --> 21:12.970
Oh, Pops, you don't have
to make stuff up.

21:12.972 --> 21:14.472
You'll always be
a hero to me.

21:14.474 --> 21:17.642
But I spent four hours
digging this up...
