This is crazy.

01:31.157 --> 01:32.658
Come on, now,

01:32.659 --> 01:33.659
we'd better rehearse the drop.

A baby?

04:10.817 --> 04:12.818
Yeah.

04:12.819 --> 04:14.319
I'd love a baby.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.822
I really would, but later.

04:16.822 --> 04:17.822
Not now, okay?

04:17.824 --> 04:21.326
Well, I didn't mean
right this minute.

04:21.327 --> 04:23.328
It takes a little while.

04:25.331 --> 04:27.332

a little something else.

only happened once before.

is that I've never been
unfaithful to you.

really in the mood now.

the practice.

maybe it might break the tension

07:08.494 --> 07:09.494

I can't. I worked
for a long time on that.

You know what?

09:11.617 --> 09:14.619
I know about your affair.

09:14.620 --> 09:16.621
I know.

09:16.622 --> 09:18.123
Then you are having one?

09:18.124 --> 09:21.126
No.

09:21.127 --> 09:23.128
Burt, you've just admitted it.

09:23.129 --> 09:24.629
I admitted to knowing
that you know,

09:24.630 --> 09:27.132
but I didn't have any affair.

a plane landed on the highway...

where were you, really,
on that night?

a woman's apartment.

You can, and I can't?

09:53.659 --> 09:55.160
Well, let me tell you
something, Mary.

the gander can have
a hell of a good time

09:58.164 --> 09:59.664

and your professor?

10:10.676 --> 10:11.676
Let me put it this way, Mary.

10:11.677 --> 10:16.181

"adult" education.

10:23.189 --> 10:25.690
I came home early,
opened the door,

10:25.691 --> 10:27.692
and I saw you and your professor
on the couch

10:27.693 --> 10:29.194
going at it pretty good.

10:29.195 --> 10:31.196
He attacked me.

10:31.197 --> 10:33.198
Yeah, you didn't see me,
because you were so busy.

10:33.199 --> 10:34.699
I left, and I got drunk,

and I did the same thing
you did.

10:36.202 --> 10:38.203
He attacked me.

10:38.204 --> 10:40.205
What?

10:40.206 --> 10:42.707
He attacked me,
and I threw him out.

10:42.708 --> 10:45.210
That is what you walked in on,
you big dope.

10:50.716 --> 10:51.716
An attack?

10:51.717 --> 10:53.718
Yes.

Uh, not an affair, an attack?

Yes.

They look the same.

11:03.229 --> 11:06.231
because of what you thought
you walked in on,

Oh, Mary, I thought
you were having an affair.

11:23.749 --> 11:25.750
I mean, you understand me?

11:25.751 --> 11:27.752
I did it because I was hurt

11:27.753 --> 11:29.254
and angry and drunk,

11:29.255 --> 11:31.257
not because I wanted to.

Uh... who is she?

11:36.262 --> 11:37.262
That's not important.

I want to know.

Mary, it's meaningless,
it's over.

In fact,
I think she was grotesque.

I didn't know what to do.

12:26.312 --> 12:27.312
I didn't want to do that.

12:27.313 --> 12:29.814
I wanted to die,

I really did it.

you did it.

Oh, sure, I could have come in,

12:42.328 --> 12:43.828
pulled the two of you apart,

12:43.829 --> 12:45.831
and said, "Pardon me,
are you doing it?"

12:53.839 --> 12:56.841
Look, Mary,
I only know one thing:

12:56.842 --> 12:59.844
that what we have
is more important to me

for the other man I care for

then I will have both men here

either man here,

19:43.248 --> 19:45.750
So how you doing, Jodie?
You feeling okay?

19:47.753 --> 19:48.753
Fine, fine.

you're feeling better.

19:52.758 --> 19:54.258
Listen,

19:54.259 --> 19:56.260
I... I changed
your room

19:56.261 --> 19:57.261
into a sewing room,

19:57.262 --> 19:58.763
but I'd love to change it back.

19:58.764 --> 19:59.764
I mean, I never sew,

19:59.765 --> 20:01.265
and every time I pass it,

20:01.266 --> 20:02.266
it makes me feel guilty,

20:02.267 --> 20:03.768
so why don't you move back in?

20:03.769 --> 20:05.269
I know what you're thinking.

20:05.270 --> 20:06.771
That I wouldn't have to sew.

20:06.772 --> 20:09.273
It'd be wonderful.
I hate sewing.

20:09.274 --> 20:10.775
I'm not gonna kill myself.

20:10.776 --> 20:12.276
Did I say that?

20:12.277 --> 20:15.279
Did you hear me say
anything about killing?

20:15.280 --> 20:16.781
I mentioned sewing, not killing.

20:16.782 --> 20:18.282
Ma, I'm gonna be okay.
