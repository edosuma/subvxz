I don't know what port is.

07:59.797 --> 08:01.831
To catching a serial killer.

08:01.849 --> 08:03.349
To catching a serial killer.

08:03.350 --> 08:04.500
To Rihanna,

08:04.501 --> 08:06.001
because I love Rihanna.

08:06.019 --> 08:07.436
Okay.

08:09.723 --> 08:11.140
Case closed.

08:11.141 --> 08:12.475
What time is it?

08:12.476 --> 08:15.111
That's right, it's nib o'clock.

08:15.112 --> 08:18.648
Whoo, new case, new nib.

08:18.649 --> 08:20.900
Read 20 words, that's a nib.

08:20.901 --> 08:22.985
Hmm, that nib was kind of small.

08:22.986 --> 08:24.203
Hey, sarge?

08:24.238 --> 08:26.539
You may want to slow down
on those things.

08:26.573 --> 08:28.023
Things?

08:28.024 --> 08:30.209
These are the precious jewels
of the rain forest, Boyle.

08:30.210 --> 08:35.414
I don't mean to overstep here,
but you're looking a little...

08:35.414 --> 08:37.717
fat.

08:37.717 --> 08:39.217
Oh, boy.

08:39.219 --> 08:41.921
How dare you?

08:41.922 --> 08:43.873
You can't comment on my body.

08:43.890 --> 08:46.175
This is a workplace.

08:46.176 --> 08:49.095
Now I'm feeling objectified
by your male gaze.

08:49.146 --> 08:50.145
Absolutely not.

08:50.147 --> 08:51.147
Sir, just listen.

08:51.148 --> 08:52.315
No, I don't want
to listen, Boyle.

08:52.316 --> 08:54.901
You are trying to shame me,
and that will not fly.

08:54.935 --> 08:56.102
Okay.

08:56.153 --> 08:58.821
Now I need some more nibs
just to calm down.

08:59.823 --> 09:01.991
- Jake, dope alley.
- I know.

09:01.992 --> 09:04.193
I think this is where
Batman's parents got killed.

09:04.194 --> 09:05.394
I'll take your word for it.

09:05.395 --> 09:06.829
The juvie angle didn't pan out.

09:06.864 --> 09:08.164
Neither did the B and Es,

09:08.165 --> 09:09.949
but I traced the label
on the slayer's oolong.

09:09.950 --> 09:12.368
Turns out he got it
at Chang's Medicinal Tea Shop.

09:12.402 --> 09:13.619
Good work, Peralta.

09:13.620 --> 09:15.288
Breakthrough selfie?

09:15.289 --> 09:16.956
Why not?

09:16.957 --> 09:18.741
Breakthrough.

09:18.759 --> 09:20.243
<i>So what's the plan, boss?</i>

09:20.277 --> 09:22.378
We create a diversion
while Gina copies

09:22.379 --> 09:23.429
his customer files.

09:23.463 --> 09:25.181
My thumb drive
looks like a watermelon,

09:25.182 --> 09:27.016
because I adore the summertime.

09:27.050 --> 09:28.217
Oh, I love that.

09:28.218 --> 09:30.586
Let's do this.

09:30.604 --> 09:32.471
Oh, hey, pal, that's my ginkgo.

09:32.522 --> 09:34.223
It's my ginkgo now, old man.

09:34.257 --> 09:36.442
I'm still young enough
to beat that ginkgo

09:36.443 --> 09:37.944
out of your hands.

09:37.945 --> 09:40.863
[both grunting]

09:40.898 --> 09:42.231
Hey, knock it off back there.

09:42.232 --> 09:44.200
[glass shattering]

09:44.201 --> 09:46.118
[both grunting]

09:46.119 --> 09:49.121
[objects clattering]

09:49.122 --> 09:51.908
[both grunting]

09:51.909 --> 09:53.242
This is so much fun.

09:53.243 --> 09:54.243
Hit me in the face.

09:54.244 --> 09:55.244
[grunts]

09:55.245 --> 09:56.879
Oh, that was
a terrible suggestion.

09:58.048 --> 09:59.048
Oh.

09:59.049 --> 10:00.049
[both grunt]

10:00.050 --> 10:02.251
All right.

10:02.285 --> 10:04.720
Western medicine rules!

10:04.755 --> 10:06.305
<i>All right, sluggers.</i>

10:06.340 --> 10:08.457
Let's see what you got
for the big b-day bash.

10:08.458 --> 10:10.018
I thought you wanted us
to surprise you.

10:10.060 --> 10:12.178
It's a figure of speech,
Detective Stupid-ago.

10:12.229 --> 10:15.264
Well, I was thinking a DJ,

10:15.265 --> 10:18.317
two signature cocktails,
passed hors d'oeuvres

10:18.318 --> 10:19.485
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:19.486 --> 10:20.569
Passed hors d'oeuvres?

10:20.570 --> 10:23.406
What is this,
a fundraiser for French dorks?

10:23.407 --> 10:25.825
So no passed hors d'oeuvres?

10:25.859 --> 10:27.777
I can't even answer that.

10:27.778 --> 10:29.445
All right, tough guy.

10:29.446 --> 10:30.446
What do you got planned?

10:30.480 --> 10:31.480
I don't know.

10:31.481 --> 10:35.668
Meet at a bar and...

10:35.669 --> 10:36.668
drink there.

10:36.670 --> 10:37.837
That's it?

10:37.838 --> 10:39.588
Well, it's still better
than Santiago's.

10:39.589 --> 10:42.091
Look, this is real
important to me, all right?

10:42.092 --> 10:43.926
My brother's hot wife
is gonna be there,

10:43.927 --> 10:45.928
and I haven't seen her
since his funeral.

10:45.929 --> 10:47.296
- Wow.
- Yeah, right?

10:47.297 --> 10:49.548
I mean, you only get one shot
at your brother's widow.

10:51.468 --> 10:52.468
Just go.

10:52.469 --> 10:53.469
Oh.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.394
- Partner.
- Partner.

11:01.395 --> 11:02.728
Not many people buy that tea,

11:02.779 --> 11:05.481
and only one has been doing so
since the killings first began,

11:05.482 --> 11:06.482
and he has a record.

11:06.483 --> 11:07.483
His name?

11:07.484 --> 11:09.118
Braxton O'Reilly.

11:09.152 --> 11:10.202
[gasps]

11:10.203 --> 11:11.821
He's a maniac.

11:11.822 --> 11:14.206
Arrested in '84
for torturing an animal?

11:14.207 --> 11:16.208
Oh, this is our guy.

11:16.209 --> 11:17.710
Oh, man, just a squirrel?

11:17.744 --> 11:19.028
Still counts.

11:19.046 --> 11:20.663
Let's get that psycho.

11:21.665 --> 11:22.965
NYPD, nobody move.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.667
Where is Braxton O'Reilly?

11:24.668 --> 11:26.719
Where is that psycho monster?

11:26.753 --> 11:29.138
He's dead.

11:29.172 --> 11:30.923
Our condolences.

11:32.309 --> 11:33.542
You were working a case.

11:33.560 --> 11:34.560
I freaking knew it.

11:34.561 --> 11:35.895
- You're a liar.
- And you.

11:35.929 --> 11:38.380
You can't do anything
except disobey orders

11:38.398 --> 11:39.398
and screw up.

11:39.399 --> 11:40.566
I'm disappointed too.

11:40.567 --> 11:41.817
No one cares, Bob.

11:41.818 --> 11:44.737
And after all
your so-called detective work,

11:44.738 --> 11:47.073
you didn't even
get the right guy.

11:47.074 --> 11:49.025
Raymond, Raymond, Raymond...

11:49.026 --> 11:50.860
- It was an error, but...
- Do not interrupt me.

11:50.894 --> 11:52.411
Raymond, Raymond,
Raymond, Raymond.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.030
Seven times, once for every day

11:54.031 --> 11:56.832
your juicy, insubordinate ass
is suspended.

11:56.867 --> 11:58.250
<i>Same goes for you, Peralta.</i>

11:58.285 --> 12:01.403
Except for the juicy ass part,
because your ass is stupid.

12:01.404 --> 12:02.905
Now get the hell
out of my office.

12:05.909 --> 12:08.243
Wait a minute, sir.

12:08.244 --> 12:10.179
You know what.

12:10.180 --> 12:12.247
Screw this.

12:14.250 --> 12:15.250
It's ten days now.

12:15.251 --> 12:16.772
Shouldn't have gone back in.

12:19.651 --> 12:21.736
I am skraight-up depressed.

12:21.770 --> 12:23.688
Amy's been doing her best
to cheer me up.

12:23.689 --> 12:24.989
She gave me this sticker
this morning

12:24.990 --> 12:26.324
just for waking up.

12:26.325 --> 12:28.493
Ew, it's like you're
dating your teacher.

12:28.527 --> 12:30.444
I know. It's so hot.

12:30.445 --> 12:32.280
Meanwhile, Holt
won't even talk to me.

12:32.331 --> 12:33.331
How is he, by the way?

12:33.332 --> 12:34.582
Honestly, terrible.

12:34.616 --> 12:36.501
I've only heard from him
once this week,

12:36.502 --> 12:38.452
and that was to tell me
he'd finally come up with

12:38.453 --> 12:41.455
a new, non-threatening
term for task forces.

12:41.507 --> 12:42.840
Ya'll ready for this?

12:42.841 --> 12:43.840
Do groups.

12:43.842 --> 12:46.511
Wow, that sucks tremendously.

12:46.512 --> 12:47.511
Can I have another port?

12:47.513 --> 12:48.880
You're still
drinking that stuff?

12:48.914 --> 12:50.131
Yeah, Holt got me hooked on it.

12:50.132 --> 12:51.599
I even got a bottle
for my house.

12:51.600 --> 12:52.934
It's really classing up
the booze

12:52.935 --> 12:55.686
and take-out menus shelf.

12:55.687 --> 12:58.422
Wait a minute.

12:58.423 --> 12:59.891
I think I just
figured something out.

12:59.892 --> 13:00.891
I got to go.

13:00.893 --> 13:02.860
Aren't you forgetting something?

13:02.861 --> 13:03.861
Uh...

13:08.150 --> 13:10.818
No, pay your bill.

13:10.819 --> 13:12.703
Damn, who raised you?

13:14.656 --> 13:15.740
Oh, my God.

13:15.741 --> 13:17.124
You friended the vulture?

13:17.159 --> 13:19.160
Well, he's not
telling us anything,

13:19.161 --> 13:21.412
so it was the only way
to figure out what he likes.

13:21.446 --> 13:22.496
Maybe this will help.

13:22.497 --> 13:24.632
He just said his
favorite color is underboob.

13:24.633 --> 13:26.167
Look, Amy,
you're a good detective.

13:26.168 --> 13:28.688
You don't have to perfectly plan
some butthead's birthday party.

13:28.720 --> 13:29.754
I'm sorry,

13:29.755 --> 13:31.756
but I believe
that hard work pays off.

13:31.790 --> 13:33.424
- Shut up.
- Excuse me?

13:33.458 --> 13:34.976
No, no, no, shut up and look.

13:34.977 --> 13:36.093
You're completely right.

13:36.094 --> 13:37.929
Your hard work just paid off.

13:37.930 --> 13:40.014
The vulture is in a band?

13:40.065 --> 13:43.317
<i>Fantastic Jack
and the Junkyard Rats.</i>

13:43.352 --> 13:45.319
Just when I thought he couldn't
be any more the worst,

13:45.320 --> 13:47.104
he out-the worsts himself.

13:47.138 --> 13:48.990
- [laughs]
- I have an idea.

13:49.024 --> 13:51.525
I don't know why you insisted
on eating here, Gina.

13:51.526 --> 13:53.578
It seems like
your average greasy spoon.

13:53.579 --> 13:54.812
Pardon me.

13:54.813 --> 13:57.665
Did one of you order
the hot plate of justice?

13:57.699 --> 13:59.083
Peralta, what are you
doing here?

13:59.117 --> 14:01.335
Saving New York City
from a maniacal...

14:01.336 --> 14:02.370
Um, excuse me?

14:02.371 --> 14:03.621
Are those my eggs?

14:03.655 --> 14:05.656
You kind of interrupted
an incredible moment,

14:05.657 --> 14:07.458
but here, take that.

14:07.459 --> 14:09.677
No, no, we can't
be seen together.

14:09.678 --> 14:10.962
Gina, did you know about this?

14:10.996 --> 14:12.797
Uh, tricking you was
the only way

14:12.798 --> 14:14.298
I could get you to talk to him.

14:14.299 --> 14:16.183
Plus, you know I heart intrigue.

14:16.218 --> 14:18.886
Sir, take a look
at these photos.

14:18.887 --> 14:21.105
None of the victims had any
alcohol in their apartments.

14:21.106 --> 14:22.440
Not even a dusty bottle.

14:22.441 --> 14:23.674
You want to know why?

14:23.675 --> 14:25.610
Because they were all sober.

14:25.644 --> 14:27.728
They all attended
12-step programs.

14:27.729 --> 14:28.729
None of them the same one,

14:28.730 --> 14:30.448
but they all have
the same leader,

14:30.449 --> 14:33.117
a creep with a record
of torturing animals.

14:33.118 --> 14:35.620
I'm talking dogs.

14:35.621 --> 14:37.121
I found the Oolong Slayer,

14:37.122 --> 14:38.322
and his name is...

14:38.323 --> 14:40.458
I never do this,
but I kind of ordered rye.

14:40.492 --> 14:41.859
Ma'am, I'm not a waiter, okay?

14:41.860 --> 14:42.994
I'm trying to blow
my friend's mind over here.

14:43.028 --> 14:45.296
Could someone get
this lunatic some rye?

14:45.297 --> 14:47.197
His name is James Dylan Borden,

14:47.198 --> 14:49.867
and he works the night shift
at creep-a-palooza...

14:49.868 --> 14:51.869
the mannequin factory
in Red Hook.

14:51.870 --> 14:52.870
I'll pick you up at 8:00.

14:52.871 --> 14:54.138
Are you insane?

14:54.139 --> 14:56.841
We were just suspended
for screwing up this case.

14:56.842 --> 14:58.259
I shouldn't even be talking
to you.

14:58.310 --> 15:00.311
Wuntch can probably
hear us right now.

15:00.312 --> 15:03.147
She has super sonar hearing,

15:03.148 --> 15:04.265
because she's a bat.

15:04.266 --> 15:06.067
Sir, we're tracking
a serial killer.

15:06.068 --> 15:07.068
There's nothing better.

15:07.069 --> 15:08.069
We're living the dream.

15:08.070 --> 15:09.186
That's your dream.

15:09.220 --> 15:11.322
Mine was to run the nine-nine,

15:11.323 --> 15:14.825
and that will
never happen again.

15:14.826 --> 15:18.496
Just give the case
to major crimes.

15:18.497 --> 15:20.164
Wow.

15:20.165 --> 15:21.732
Never thought I'd live
to see Holt side

15:21.733 --> 15:24.068
with the vulture and Wuntch.

15:24.069 --> 15:25.252
Mark the day, Gina.

15:25.253 --> 15:27.088
May 18th at 4:00 p.m.

15:27.122 --> 15:28.122
Oh, honey.

15:28.123 --> 15:30.291
We're well into October.

15:30.292 --> 15:31.625
Really?

15:31.677 --> 15:33.127
<i>Hey, Charles.</i>

15:33.178 --> 15:34.378
I thought you should know.

15:34.379 --> 15:38.766
I heard what you said,
and it really sank in.

15:38.767 --> 15:40.134
I'm off the nibs.

15:40.185 --> 15:42.053
- Really?
- Of course.

15:42.054 --> 15:43.888
I'm Terry Jeffords,

15:43.889 --> 15:46.640
and when I put
my mind to something,

15:46.641 --> 15:47.640
I do it.

15:47.642 --> 15:48.943
[chuckles]

15:48.944 --> 15:51.645
My resting heart rate is six.

15:51.697 --> 15:52.780
Six, Boyle.
