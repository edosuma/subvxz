00:13.802 --> 00:16.311
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Kiry

00:47.616 --> 00:50.887
Clay, why are you using
that thing to cut a coffee cake?

00:51.246 --> 00:51.986
Here.

00:52.499 --> 00:53.720
Brenda Leigh!

00:53.967 --> 00:54.863
Fritzi!

00:55.480 --> 00:57.978
Y'all come and get it
while it's still hot!

01:07.022 --> 01:07.904
Ta-da!

01:11.697 --> 01:13.814
Who else is coming for breakfast?

01:14.481 --> 01:15.611
Switzerland?

01:16.410 --> 01:17.708
Don't be silly.

01:21.181 --> 01:23.622
Shopped in Palm Springs yesterday.

01:23.742 --> 01:26.154
Made breakfast in L.A. this morning.

01:26.274 --> 01:27.924
I just love that rv.

01:28.084 --> 01:30.343
We're gonna go from here up
to Alaska and then come back

01:30.503 --> 01:31.927
through the Yukon territory.

01:32.047 --> 01:33.702
We'll be done by thanksgiving.

01:33.822 --> 01:36.897
Oh, unless
we need to come back sooner, you know?

01:45.135 --> 01:47.179
I hear Canada's pretty in the fall.

01:48.728 --> 01:50.447
Clay, we talked about this.

01:50.951 --> 01:54.450
It doesn't matter when they get married
as long as they're happy.

01:54.706 --> 01:56.953
Anybody want
some more biscuits and gravy?

01:57.113 --> 01:59.180
You know what makes me happy?

01:59.458 --> 02:00.550
Weddings.

02:01.225 --> 02:02.834
I just love weddings.

02:02.994 --> 02:04.920
Don't you like weddings, son?

02:08.652 --> 02:09.795
The phone.

02:13.081 --> 02:13.860
Hello?

02:14.457 --> 02:16.164
Oh, yes, sergeant. Morning.

02:18.563 --> 02:19.395
Okay.

02:20.581 --> 02:21.353
Where?

02:23.348 --> 02:24.052
Yes.

02:24.172 --> 02:25.690
OK, fine. I'll be right there.

02:25.850 --> 02:29.788
I'm so sorry to cut this short, but
there's been a murder at a movie studio.

02:30.772 --> 02:34.084
And... And this was such
a great breakfast, too.

02:44.245 --> 02:45.258
Honey...

02:45.648 --> 02:47.422
I thought we had an agreement

02:47.542 --> 02:50.053
that you would never leave me alone
with your parents again.

02:50.173 --> 02:51.803
I had no choice, Fritzi.

02:51.923 --> 02:55.647
And I didn't even know they were coming
until they showed up last night.

03:09.877 --> 03:10.773
I got it.

03:18.147 --> 03:20.125
Special agent Fritz Howard, FBI.

03:20.422 --> 03:23.207
Oh, you're kidding.
Oh, that's... No, horrible.

03:23.327 --> 03:24.530
Oh, that is bad.

03:25.399 --> 03:26.334
Horrible.

03:26.764 --> 03:29.579
No, no, no.
I'll be there as soon as possible.

03:29.817 --> 03:31.951
There's a bomb threat at the airport.

03:33.168 --> 03:37.053
Well, this has got to be the most
dangerous city on the planet earth.

03:37.213 --> 03:38.647
No, I'm on my way.

03:39.424 --> 03:42.574
But we can't leave mama and daddy
here by themselves.

03:42.877 --> 03:46.187
Brenda Leigh, don't worry about us.
We'll be fine. Won't we, dear?

03:46.347 --> 03:48.982
Yeah, and there's no reason why
they can't come along with one of us.

03:49.142 --> 03:51.452
What would you guys rather do?
You can come with me now,

03:51.572 --> 03:55.780
spend a few hours in a makeshift tent
watching an extremely slow-moving robot,

03:55.940 --> 03:58.263
or you can head off to
a Hollywood movie studio.

03:58.383 --> 03:59.596
Either way.

04:02.907 --> 04:04.117
Oh, goodness.

04:04.709 --> 04:07.807
Is this where they do
"dancing with the stars"?

04:29.167 --> 04:31.587
<i>I'd like to welcome you
to vintage studios.</i>

04:31.707 --> 04:34.486
<i>- I'll be your tour guide. My name is...</i>
- Bye.

04:34.852 --> 04:36.713
Bye, y'all. I'm gonna take your picture.

04:36.833 --> 04:37.728
Have fun.

04:38.269 --> 04:39.206
Good bye.

04:40.948 --> 04:41.674
Our,

04:41.794 --> 04:44.015
victim's name is Rachel Hughes.

04:44.135 --> 04:46.353
She's a 33-year-old white female.

04:46.473 --> 04:49.110
She works as a,
hair stylist on "trauma unit."

04:50.218 --> 04:52.873
It's a television show.
Films here on the lot.

04:52.993 --> 04:54.965
We've already started
criminal-background

04:55.125 --> 04:57.116
checks on all the cast and crew members.

04:57.236 --> 05:00.511
- Where was the body found?
- She was stuffed in a jockey box.

05:00.631 --> 05:02.269
That's what they call the,

05:02.568 --> 05:05.183
storage lockers underneath the truck.

05:05.512 --> 05:08.645
This morning, an electrician went
into this particular jockey box,

05:08.805 --> 05:10.575
looking for some extra cable.

05:10.695 --> 05:11.993
Found her inside.

05:13.322 --> 05:14.067
Okay.

05:31.111 --> 05:35.213
Defensive wounds on her knuckles.
Scrape marks on her elbows and ankles.

05:35.373 --> 05:38.736
There's scuff marks
on the sides of her shoes and heels.

05:38.856 --> 05:40.212
So she was dragged.

05:40.332 --> 05:42.637
Yeah,
there's a trail of blood that leads from

05:42.797 --> 05:44.999
the hair-and-makeup trailer
to this one here.

05:49.251 --> 05:50.995
Oh, these marks here.

05:51.221 --> 05:53.513
Did the coroner's investigator
say what caused them?

05:53.633 --> 05:54.274
No.

05:56.797 --> 05:58.281
And no one heard screaming?

05:58.401 --> 06:00.957
According to studio security,
no one heard a thing.

06:05.494 --> 06:08.663
Oh, Rachel stayed late
after filming stopped yesterday

06:08.823 --> 06:10.190
Not a lot of people around.

06:10.310 --> 06:11.750
And we know this how?

06:11.910 --> 06:15.712
Well, Rachel shared a trailer
with a makeup artist, Kim reynolds.

06:15.998 --> 06:19.134
And Kim left last night
around 8:00 p. m.

06:19.518 --> 06:22.121
She said that Rachel
was waiting for someone.

06:27.052 --> 06:28.350
Any idea who?

06:35.165 --> 06:36.207
Makeup girl,

06:36.442 --> 06:37.275
woman

06:37.395 --> 06:41.661
said that Rachel was hanging out
waiting for one of her private clients.

06:43.172 --> 06:44.200
No name?

06:44.692 --> 06:46.862
Well, according to this makeup girl...

06:46.982 --> 06:47.988
Woman...

06:48.108 --> 06:51.258
Rachel was the kind of person who
kept her schedule on her cellphone,

06:51.378 --> 06:53.431
which she left at home yesterday.

06:53.551 --> 06:55.424
Now, Rachel's keys are missing,

06:55.544 --> 06:57.296
but her car is still here.

06:58.706 --> 07:01.066
Did Rachel have a boyfriend
or a husband?

07:01.357 --> 07:02.762
Anyone come looking for her?

07:02.882 --> 07:04.974
Yeah, detective Daniels
is checking on that now.

07:05.094 --> 07:06.687
All right. Thank you.

07:20.024 --> 07:23.604
Whoever attacked Rachel, they slammed
her head up against the mirror.

07:28.022 --> 07:31.731
And she didn't get a chance
to clean up after her private client.

07:33.058 --> 07:36.611
And it looks like all this hair
is from the same head.

07:37.151 --> 07:39.858
Yeah, and we have an idea
whose head it might be.

07:40.209 --> 07:41.750
Rachel Hughes was married.

07:41.870 --> 07:43.702
But six months ago,
she filed for divorce

07:43.822 --> 07:47.263
and had a restraing order issued
against her husband, Ryan.

07:47.713 --> 07:48.832
Security logs.

07:48.952 --> 07:51.847
This is everybody who entered
the lot in the last 24 hours. Now,

07:51.967 --> 07:53.682
guess who dropped by for a visit.

07:53.802 --> 07:54.769
Ryan Hughes.

07:55.069 --> 07:57.021
Last night... 8:24 p. m.

07:59.048 --> 08:00.990
Looks like
Rachel's husband wasn't taking

08:01.110 --> 08:02.996
his restraing order very seriously.

08:04.735 --> 08:07.728
- Where does he live?
- No new address for him anywhere.

08:08.014 --> 08:10.708
All right. Sergeant Gabriel,
lieutenant Flynn,

08:11.222 --> 08:14.079
let's head over to the victim's house
and find that cellphone.

08:14.199 --> 08:15.641
Is that a current address?

08:15.761 --> 08:18.960
The address on the restraining order
matches the one on her driver's license.

08:19.120 --> 08:20.962
Okay. Lieutenant Provenza,

08:21.122 --> 08:22.605
would you please organize some

08:22.725 --> 08:25.442
interviews with all the people
who were at the studio last night?

08:25.562 --> 08:26.262
OK.

08:27.627 --> 08:29.387
And, detective Daniels,

08:29.926 --> 08:32.307
would you and detective Sanchez

08:32.912 --> 08:34.785
please find Ryan Hughes for me?

08:35.710 --> 08:37.583
I'd rather like to talk to him.

08:44.770 --> 08:47.165
Oh, that blood looks so real.

08:47.685 --> 08:48.414
Clay,

08:48.534 --> 08:49.390
smile.

08:52.028 --> 08:53.068
Thank you.

08:53.488 --> 08:55.683
Lieutenant Provenza,
you remember my parents.

08:55.803 --> 08:57.221
Well, of course.

08:57.341 --> 08:59.139
Hello, there, Willie Ray.

08:59.259 --> 09:01.846
Clay. To what do we owe this pleasure?

09:01.966 --> 09:04.005
I think somebody got murdered.

09:04.618 --> 09:07.425
Y'all are finished with the tour?
Already?

09:07.585 --> 09:09.360
Oh, it was just like a dream.

09:09.480 --> 09:11.096
Of a big trailer lot.

09:12.263 --> 09:14.697
Well, I need to run an errand,
but lieutenant Provenza

09:14.817 --> 09:16.977
will organize a ride for y'all
back to the office.

09:17.137 --> 09:18.682
I'll do better than that, chief.

09:18.802 --> 09:22.440
How would the two of you
like to watch some filming?

09:22.600 --> 09:25.369
Oh, my goodness, my goodness. Really?

09:25.649 --> 09:26.808
Come on, Willie Ray.

09:26.928 --> 09:29.030
Let me show you where
the magic happens.

09:29.190 --> 09:32.040
Lieutenant, I'll bet you say that
to all the girls.

09:32.841 --> 09:35.613
I bet he does say that to all the girls.

09:35.733 --> 09:36.955
I know his type.

09:39.077 --> 09:40.336
How long you gonna be?

09:40.456 --> 09:42.210
I just need to hop
by the victim's house.

09:42.370 --> 09:44.112
You'll hardly know I'm gone.

09:55.450 --> 09:58.053
God, you scared the crap out of me.

09:58.690 --> 10:00.186
So sorry. Excuse me.

10:00.818 --> 10:04.474
I'm deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson
from the L.A.P.D. And you are?

10:05.002 --> 10:06.238
Ryan Hughes.

10:10.123 --> 10:11.955
It's so nice to meet you, sir.

10:12.942 --> 10:15.493
We thought...
We were looking for your wife.

10:16.247 --> 10:19.886
Rachel doesn't live here anymore.
And I was on my way to the gym, so...

10:20.006 --> 10:21.658
Well, maybe you could help us then.

10:21.778 --> 10:23.456
Can we come in, ask you a few questions?

10:23.576 --> 10:25.253
- Do you have a warrant?
- No.

10:29.668 --> 10:31.106
Out here's good.

10:31.486 --> 10:32.873
What do you want to know?

10:33.379 --> 10:35.180
When was the last time
you saw your wife?

10:35.340 --> 10:37.064
I don't remember, exactly.

10:38.350 --> 10:40.432
Do you know how to get
in touch with her?

10:40.552 --> 10:43.009
She works on a television show:
"trauma unit."

10:43.129 --> 10:44.448
She's not there today.

10:45.659 --> 10:47.943
- OK, then. Try her cellphone.
- No answer.

10:48.103 --> 10:49.599
Where is she staying, sir?

10:49.719 --> 10:52.452
Look, my wife and I are separated.
She won't even give me her new address.

10:52.572 --> 10:54.821
Is that 'cause of the
restraing order issued against you?

10:54.941 --> 10:57.137
- Nice haircut, champ.
- Rachel's work, I take it.

10:57.257 --> 11:00.474
From last night, right? Isn't that why
your name's on the security list?

11:02.197 --> 11:03.993
- I knew it!
- Take it easy.

11:05.112 --> 11:06.843
She told me I could be there, OK?

11:06.963 --> 11:09.212
Well, she didn't like
the way the visit ended.

11:10.130 --> 11:13.969
Ryan Hughes, you're under arrest for
the violation of your restraing order.

11:14.129 --> 11:17.224
- Hands behind your back, please.
- You have the right to remain silent.

11:17.344 --> 11:20.154
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

11:20.274 --> 11:21.964
You have the right to an attorney.

11:22.084 --> 11:26.231
If you cannot afford an attorney, one
will be appointed to you by the state.

11:26.850 --> 11:29.609
You know, we don't have have
anyone from the L.A.P.D.

11:29.769 --> 11:32.112
At this airport bombing,
not a single officer.

11:32.272 --> 11:34.430
We're not at L.A.X.
We're in Ontario.

11:35.953 --> 11:37.560
Oh... Ontario.

11:38.406 --> 11:40.752
<i>Look, we're trying to keep</i>
this low-profile.

11:40.872 --> 11:43.703
So try not mentioning it
to everyone you know, okay?

11:43.823 --> 11:46.848
Detective sanchez is completely out of
it 'cause of the death of his brother.

11:46.968 --> 11:48.917
And what am I supposed to do
with my parents?

11:49.037 --> 11:51.156
I've got a suspect
in the interview room who probably

11:51.276 --> 11:53.800
- beat his wife to death last night.
- Probably?!

11:53.960 --> 11:55.704
- When can you come home?
- Honey,

11:55.824 --> 12:00.324
I can't leave the mobile command unit
until we know there's no bomb out here.

12:00.444 --> 12:02.603
Besides, Willie Ray and Clay
are old enough

12:02.723 --> 12:05.318
to stay in our apartment
for a few hours by themselves.

12:05.438 --> 12:06.554
We have cable.

12:06.674 --> 12:09.393
<i>Oh, no.</i> I don't want them
at the apartment by themselves.

12:09.513 --> 12:11.607
They'll... They'll do things.

12:11.727 --> 12:13.486
I'll take care of your parents, chief.

12:13.646 --> 12:16.123
No. I can't impose on you again.
We're working.

12:16.243 --> 12:19.218
I'm losing another
15 sick days next month.

12:19.338 --> 12:22.579
Look, you've arrested the husband.
This case is effectively over.

12:22.739 --> 12:24.173
All right, fine.

12:24.432 --> 12:25.879
- Fritzi...
- Yeah.

12:26.159 --> 12:29.847
Lieutenant Provenza has volunteered
to take care of my poor parents, so

12:30.177 --> 12:32.380
so thanks so much for your help.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.259
- Lieutenant, are you sure about this?
- Oh, chief.

12:43.379 --> 12:46.473
Now, the suspect
will be in tears in 20 minutes.

12:46.593 --> 12:49.006
Hold his hand, write him up, the end.

12:50.607 --> 12:54.736
Honey, I think your mother and I ought
to go on and get out of your way.

12:54.896 --> 12:57.402
You're not in the way, daddy.
Don't be silly.

12:57.893 --> 13:00.470
But if y'all have had enough here,
lieutenant Provenza

13:00.590 --> 13:03.333
has kindly offered to drive you back
to the apartment.

13:03.453 --> 13:05.957
Oh, no, no, no.
We don't want to be in the way.

13:06.077 --> 13:08.521
- We'll just take a cab.
- I wouldn't hear of it. Chief,

13:08.641 --> 13:11.711
Chief, you do what you need to do,
and I'll entertain your parents.

13:11.871 --> 13:13.586
We don't need entertaining.

13:13.820 --> 13:16.006
I'm entertaining enough on my own.

13:16.126 --> 13:18.297
Clay, what's wrong with you?

13:18.417 --> 13:19.957
Lieutenant Provenza,

13:20.077 --> 13:24.266
we'll drive by the grocery store, and
I'll pick up some things for dinner.

13:24.618 --> 13:27.769
Oh, Willie Ray,
that sounds wonderful to me.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.501
Well, if you're too busy,

13:30.621 --> 13:33.603
I guess I'll just have to get
to know your friends.

13:39.232 --> 13:41.707
Please tell me we found where
Rachel Hughes was living.

13:41.827 --> 13:43.550
No one at the studio can tell us,

13:43.670 --> 13:46.329
and her paychecks
go directly to A P. O. Box.

13:46.606 --> 13:49.904
And she never updated her
next-of-kin information. So,

13:50.159 --> 13:53.128
the guy that we're supposed to notify
is her husband.

13:53.288 --> 13:55.847
OK, so, let's use her
social security number and see

13:55.967 --> 13:57.596
if we can find someone in her family.

13:57.716 --> 14:00.933
Maybe she told her parents where
she lived, though I don't recommend it.

14:01.053 --> 14:02.773
Lt Tao, what about her phone records?

14:02.893 --> 14:06.167
I'm waiting for Rachel's carrier
to send me the dump off her cell.

14:06.527 --> 14:08.128
Yeah, what about the husband?

14:08.248 --> 14:10.692
Ryan Hughes? Oh, this is a great guy.

14:10.812 --> 14:12.893
A year ago, he broke Rachel's wrist.

14:13.013 --> 14:15.191
Six months ago,
he gave her a concussion.

14:15.351 --> 14:17.338
And a day later,
she checked out of the E.R.

14:17.458 --> 14:20.561
And then took the restraing order out
on her husband and filed for divorce.

14:20.681 --> 14:21.990
And left her own house?

14:22.150 --> 14:24.094
Though she's still paying the mortgage.

14:24.214 --> 14:25.869
Why on earth would she do that?

14:26.029 --> 14:28.580
I'm guessing, but
Ryan hasn't made any money lately.

14:28.740 --> 14:31.521
This year, he guest-starred
in one sitcom and one drama.

14:31.641 --> 14:33.630
Not even enough
to make his health insurance.

14:33.750 --> 14:36.169
- So he's an actor.
- Yes, and a bartender,

14:36.289 --> 14:37.394
two shifts a week.

14:37.514 --> 14:39.671
Rachel was the one
with the steady paycheck.

14:39.791 --> 14:42.886
Maybe she left Ryan the house because
he couldn't afford to go anywhere else.

14:43.046 --> 14:44.888
So what? He was beating her.

14:45.048 --> 14:47.585
Why did she move?
And where did she move to?

14:47.705 --> 14:51.186
Excuse me, but chief Pope
and commander Taylor are here.

14:51.814 --> 14:53.958
Thank you, buzz. I'll be right there.

14:54.213 --> 14:57.108
Sergeant Gabriel, would you meet me
in the interview room, please?

14:57.268 --> 14:59.929
And will somebody find me
Rachel's address? Thank you.

15:01.259 --> 15:03.205
What can I do for you, gentlemen?

15:03.325 --> 15:05.902
You like the husband for this, right?

15:06.143 --> 15:06.924
Maybe.

15:07.639 --> 15:11.167
Though I need to figure out how
he had a major knock-down, drag-out

15:11.397 --> 15:14.260
with his wife and kept his skin
smoother than mine.

15:14.380 --> 15:16.694
He's smarter than your average abuser.

15:16.937 --> 15:19.442
Wouldn't let us into his house
without a search warrant. And,

15:19.562 --> 15:21.921
if he really doesn't know
that his wife is dead,

15:22.041 --> 15:23.985
then he's a better actor than this

15:24.105 --> 15:26.159
résumé suggests. Why the interest?

15:26.772 --> 15:30.513
Well, the Times, and specifically
our old friend Ricardo Ramos,

15:30.633 --> 15:34.079
seems to have developed the opinion
that we only deploy priority homicide

15:34.199 --> 15:38.633
when the victims are rich, white,
and/or related to police officers.

15:39.149 --> 15:42.279
And our ace reporter called me
this morning, asking if we had

15:42.809 --> 15:45.621
added show-business murders to the list.

15:46.061 --> 15:49.146
- This guy's an actor, right?
- Yes, but not a famous one.

15:49.438 --> 15:50.935
He could be tomorrow.

15:51.930 --> 15:54.191
- I'm in trouble for something?
- No, no, no.

15:54.311 --> 15:56.503
No, no, no.
You're doing an incredible job.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.117
That's not the issue.

15:58.237 --> 16:00.129
The issue for Ramos is,

16:00.249 --> 16:03.471
who gets priority treatment from
the police and who doesn't. That's all.

16:03.591 --> 16:06.503
For example, we have several
investigators who deal exclusively

16:06.623 --> 16:09.939
domestic-abuse issues, and I didn't
deploy one of them to the studio.

16:10.059 --> 16:11.565
- I sent you.
- We didn't know

16:11.685 --> 16:15.204
this was a domestic-abuse case
until after we identified the victim.

16:16.021 --> 16:17.628
That's a good point, sir.

16:17.979 --> 16:20.687
But how do we avoid the impression

16:20.807 --> 16:23.862
that we made this murder a priority
because of the Hollywood connection?

16:24.022 --> 16:26.694
But that is why
it's a priority, isn't it?

16:27.323 --> 16:32.124
Yeah, that and the reporters flying
in helicopters over the studio...

16:32.782 --> 16:33.482
Sir.

16:34.643 --> 16:37.500
Yeah, but we don't want
to say any of that.

16:38.205 --> 16:41.381
Tell Ramos that we're hoping that
Rachel's murder was an isolated incident

16:41.501 --> 16:44.716
and not someone breaking into studio
lots and killing people.

16:47.364 --> 16:48.991
That might stop Ramos.

16:49.111 --> 16:50.639
Stop him from what?

16:51.243 --> 16:52.635
Nothing. Never mind.

16:52.755 --> 16:55.180
You know, tired of being pushed
around by the Times.

16:55.300 --> 16:58.005
Just, get on with what
you need to get done here.

16:58.370 --> 16:59.122
Okay.

17:09.757 --> 17:10.694
Thank you.

17:11.136 --> 17:13.328
You know this is one big setup, right?

17:13.488 --> 17:14.537
How's that, sir?

17:14.696 --> 17:16.046
Why else would Rachel tell me

17:16.165 --> 17:18.916
to stop by for a haircut and
then report me to the police?

17:19.602 --> 17:21.795
She wants to use this
to screw me in the divorce...

17:21.954 --> 17:24.142
- I doubt that.
- And ruin my career.

17:24.499 --> 17:26.863
You know, I'm unfamiliar
with your business, sir.

17:26.983 --> 17:30.136
Do two extremely small jobs
a year make a career?

17:32.862 --> 17:36.168
I'll leave my curiosity about
the part-time actor's life aside.

17:36.527 --> 17:38.251
Let's talk about last night.

17:39.055 --> 17:40.474
What's to talk about?

17:41.404 --> 17:43.733
I got a part on a big feature film.

17:44.366 --> 17:47.880
She told me to come,
she volunteered to cut my hair.

17:48.264 --> 17:51.680
And while you were there, did you guys,
did you have an argument?

17:51.800 --> 17:54.404
Did she take a little
too much off the top?

17:54.866 --> 17:56.814
No. We didn't have an argument.

17:56.934 --> 17:58.999
It's hard to believe
that he didn't work more,

17:59.119 --> 18:01.001
because you are just so convincing.

18:01.161 --> 18:03.837
Look, I just got a part
on a big studio film, so

18:03.997 --> 18:05.647
Wait, wait, wait. Let's...

18:06.246 --> 18:07.534
Let's start again.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.895
Let's start again, and this time,
I want you to remember

18:11.015 --> 18:14.639
that those hair-and-makeup trailers
have very thin walls

18:15.066 --> 18:17.538
and people hear things all the time.

18:20.180 --> 18:22.248
Did you argue with your wife, sir?

18:22.548 --> 18:24.399
We had a small disagreement.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.520
- What about?
- Look...

18:28.379 --> 18:31.112
I have done everything that
Rachel has asked me to do.

18:31.232 --> 18:34.170
I even apologized for every single
argument that we ever had

18:34.290 --> 18:37.203
and I took those anger-management
classes Donna recommended.

18:37.323 --> 18:38.500
Who's Donna?

18:39.147 --> 18:40.540
Her friend, Donna.

18:42.667 --> 18:43.956
I never met her.

18:44.076 --> 18:46.500
I don't even know her last name,
but it still doesn't

18:46.620 --> 18:50.884
stop donna from convincing my wife
that I'm an asshole, which I'm not.

18:51.537 --> 18:53.034
I mean, I'm passionate, OK?

18:53.154 --> 18:56.429
I'm sensitive. That's what
all good actors are supposed to be.

18:56.716 --> 18:58.316
But I love my wife,

18:58.987 --> 19:01.870
which is why I have stayed away
from her, just like she asked.

19:01.990 --> 19:03.906
But you didn't stay away from her, sir.

19:04.026 --> 19:06.842
- You saw her last...
- Because she told me I could!

19:10.481 --> 19:12.407
If I were you, sir,

19:13.383 --> 19:16.201
i'd put my ass back in that chair.

19:24.832 --> 19:28.698
Well, I think it's safe to say that
you are a freshman in anger management.

19:29.056 --> 19:33.322
So, I'm supposed to believe that after
you give your wife a concussion and

19:33.442 --> 19:36.596
broke her wrist, she called you up and
said, "hey, come on over for a haircut"?

19:36.756 --> 19:39.057
A haircut you felt
the need to lie about?

19:39.217 --> 19:40.308
Here we go.

19:40.468 --> 19:42.394
I didn't want to get in any trouble, OK?

19:42.554 --> 19:44.972
Is that how you usually avoid trouble?
You just lie to the police?

19:45.092 --> 19:47.340
- Look, I made a mistake, okay?
- A mistake?

19:47.460 --> 19:49.914
Like violating your restraining order
or lying to me...

19:50.034 --> 19:51.866
I did not violate
the spirit of the order.

19:51.986 --> 19:55.403
Tell me, how many mistakes did it take
before your wife ended up like this?

19:55.523 --> 19:56.509
Oh, my god.

20:01.026 --> 20:01.854
Rachel.

20:07.713 --> 20:08.898
Is she dead?

20:09.164 --> 20:10.374
Not just dead...

20:11.253 --> 20:13.556
Murdered... Savagely beaten.

20:14.127 --> 20:17.012
And to me,
it looks like someone was very angry.

20:21.944 --> 20:23.143
I want a lawyer.

20:26.626 --> 20:27.394
Fine.

20:31.354 --> 20:35.102
Sergeant, will you please see that
Mr. Hughes here gets his phone call?

20:42.572 --> 20:44.835
Chief Johnson was wrong about one thing.

20:45.096 --> 20:45.909
What?

20:46.451 --> 20:49.181
This guy's a much better actor
than we thought.

20:54.484 --> 20:56.644
It was so nice of you to drive

20:56.764 --> 20:59.930
Clay and Willie Ray around
to all these different

21:00.403 --> 21:02.642
wedding facilities, lieutenant.

21:02.902 --> 21:04.138
I enjoyed it.

21:04.258 --> 21:06.853
It reminded me of when
I was young and stupid.

21:07.730 --> 21:10.023
Brenda, where's your appetite?

21:11.518 --> 21:13.769
Well, darling,
she's still thinking about the murder.

21:13.889 --> 21:14.811
I am...

21:15.209 --> 21:16.211
A little.

21:17.447 --> 21:19.003
The victim surprises me.

21:19.123 --> 21:22.546
On the one hand, she stood up for
herself and got legal action.

21:22.666 --> 21:25.705
And on the other, she handed
over her house to a bully.

21:25.825 --> 21:28.249
I guess I just don't understand
that kind of relationship.

21:28.409 --> 21:29.634
I'll tell you one thing.

21:29.754 --> 21:32.249
If your mother
raised her hand against me,

21:32.369 --> 21:33.981
i'd be out the door.

21:36.376 --> 21:39.431
Well, you and Willie Ray
have a great marriage, Clay,

21:39.551 --> 21:42.120
which just goes to prove
that the institution

21:42.240 --> 21:44.766
doesn't have to be
a complete horror show.

21:46.130 --> 21:50.587
Actually, my third wife
and I had one fantastic weekend.

21:52.183 --> 21:55.944
Of course, that was before
the wedding, but still.

21:56.562 --> 21:58.446
Now, my fourth marriage...

21:59.207 --> 22:00.156
Oh, lord.

22:01.092 --> 22:03.249
Honey, don't listen to him.

22:04.010 --> 22:06.232
Here, uh, this will take
your mind off work.

22:06.352 --> 22:08.839
Look at that beautiful
little chapel there.

22:08.959 --> 22:10.623
Now, if you're determined not to get...

22:10.743 --> 22:13.003
Excuse me.
I'm... I'm sorry. I'll be right back.

22:18.051 --> 22:20.377
Clay, I told you about this.

22:21.064 --> 22:23.547
This what? It's a chapel.

22:23.917 --> 22:26.532
You can use a chapel
for any number of things.

22:26.652 --> 22:30.431
For example,
if they don't get married pretty soon,

22:30.551 --> 22:33.417
y'all can congregate there
for my funeral.

22:33.707 --> 22:35.358
All right, that's enough.

22:36.516 --> 22:37.314
Fritz,

22:38.384 --> 22:40.868
- Brenda looked upset.
- Did she?

22:41.838 --> 22:42.880
I'll see.

22:46.886 --> 22:50.105
"Happily ever after Resort and Casino."

22:51.532 --> 22:53.251
Talk about bad odds.

22:57.439 --> 23:00.019
If I hear one more mention
of weddings or chapels,

23:00.139 --> 23:03.339
- I swear I'm going to kill someone.
- He's just excited. That's all.

23:03.459 --> 23:04.481
No, no, no.

23:04.988 --> 23:06.692
You don't understand my daddy.

23:06.812 --> 23:09.545
When he wants something,
he will not stop until he gets it.

23:09.665 --> 23:12.645
- Trust me on this.
- So, it runs in the family then.

23:13.333 --> 23:14.185
Ha ha.

23:14.892 --> 23:17.317
Here's what I don't get.
You are so tough at work,

23:17.645 --> 23:20.335
and here, you come home. You're sitting
at your own dining-room table.

23:20.455 --> 23:23.514
Your father pushes you around
a little bit. And instead of saying,

23:23.634 --> 23:26.691
"Don't do that to me,"
you come hide in the kitchen.

23:30.823 --> 23:32.037
Wait a minute.

23:32.489 --> 23:35.088
- That's why we can't find her address.
- What?

23:35.208 --> 23:36.659
She learned to hide.

23:39.448 --> 23:41.715
She said, "Well, what are those names?"
And he said,

23:42.460 --> 23:44.803
"Well, those are Provenza's ex-wives."

23:46.808 --> 23:48.077
Just one second.

23:49.980 --> 23:51.393
Lieutenant Flynn...

23:51.553 --> 23:53.311
I'm so sorry to bother you
this late.

23:53.431 --> 23:56.398
You know that emergency room where
Rachel Hughes went for her concussion?

23:57.201 --> 24:00.853
I want you to check for
domestic-violence shelters in the area.

24:01.451 --> 24:04.406
See if there's one
that the hospital recommend...

24:07.883 --> 24:10.954
I'm particularly interested
in any with a Donna working on-site.

24:11.511 --> 24:12.798
Okay, thank you.

24:19.840 --> 24:22.849
This is what Rachel looked like
the first night she arrived.

24:23.248 --> 24:25.570
Ryan did that to her
for buying a brass lamp

24:25.690 --> 24:28.168
when he was hoping for new headshots.

24:29.019 --> 24:32.350
Well, as hard as it is to believe,
she looks even worse now.

24:32.739 --> 24:34.686
I could tell
he wasn't gonna change.

24:34.846 --> 24:36.702
- You met him?
- Somehow he found out

24:36.822 --> 24:39.649
that she'd come here. And one night,
he stopped me in the parking lot

24:39.809 --> 24:41.578
and waved like we'd met.

24:41.698 --> 24:44.167
Well, he seemed... you know,
he's very charming.

24:44.287 --> 24:47.490
And he was in my face before I realized
that he was threatening me.

24:47.650 --> 24:49.641
Thank God we have a guard posted nearby.

24:49.761 --> 24:52.599
Wait, wait. You said he threatened you?
He threatened you how?

24:52.719 --> 24:55.032
I had insisted
that Rachel get her own place

24:55.152 --> 24:56.705
and not give the address to anyone.

24:56.825 --> 24:59.836
She followed my advice,
which made Ryan furious.

24:59.996 --> 25:02.281
- That's why she had a P.O. box.
- Right.

25:02.401 --> 25:04.927
That's one of the first things
they learn, the women who come here...

25:05.047 --> 25:06.676
to defend their privacy.

25:06.836 --> 25:09.638
And Rachel participated
in our volunteer programs.

25:09.950 --> 25:11.907
We always need volunteers.

25:12.027 --> 25:14.306
We've got more women
than we can ever accommodate.

25:14.426 --> 25:17.390
Well, I know you don't usually give out
this kind of information, but...

25:17.510 --> 25:19.900
Rachel doesn't need you
to keep her address a secret anymore,

25:20.020 --> 25:21.775
and we could really use it.

25:21.935 --> 25:25.220
Actually... she gave me a spare key
to her apartment.

25:26.035 --> 25:27.920
I'll take you there myself.

25:36.908 --> 25:40.061
So, if Ryan didn't break
the door down,

25:40.787 --> 25:42.146
how did he get in?

25:42.266 --> 25:45.318
Rachel's keys were missing
from the crime scene. So he just...

25:45.438 --> 25:47.457
unlocked the door and walked in.

25:47.802 --> 25:50.751
But if Rachel was keeping
her new address a secret,

25:51.381 --> 25:52.973
how did he know to come here?

25:56.473 --> 25:58.270
Did Rachel have something Ryan wanted?

25:58.430 --> 26:00.438
- Not that I know of.
- Chief?

26:02.086 --> 26:03.525
Blood on the base.

26:04.189 --> 26:06.236
How did we end up
at another crime scene?

26:06.396 --> 26:08.985
Maybe Ryan... beat up Rachel here,

26:09.257 --> 26:11.746
and drove her back to the studio
and then beat her again.

26:11.866 --> 26:15.053
- With an interruption for a haircut?
- Okay, maybe...

26:15.361 --> 26:18.498
after the haircut, he follows her home,
kills her here.

26:19.789 --> 26:22.419
And drove her back to the studio,
past security?

26:22.579 --> 26:25.843
Dragging Rachel's body from the makeup
trailer to the jockey box?

26:25.963 --> 26:28.300
Okay, Daniels, why don't
you just figure it out?

26:28.624 --> 26:30.010
So, he kills Rachel,

26:30.582 --> 26:32.304
maybe to get the keys.

26:32.773 --> 26:34.931
But how did he know
what door they'd open?

26:38.048 --> 26:41.136
Look at this. Flynn, here, here.
Read this with me here.

26:41.425 --> 26:43.546
You do the highlighted parts.
I'll do the doctor.

26:43.666 --> 26:45.546
- What? I'm gonna do the broad's role?
- Yeah.

26:45.666 --> 26:47.658
"He's dying, ma'am.
We've done all we can."

26:47.778 --> 26:50.323
"You've got to do something, doc.
Please, anything."

26:50.443 --> 26:52.751
- "Be my hero."
- "Be my hero."

26:53.385 --> 26:55.512
Gentlemen, the cellphone. Please.

26:55.632 --> 26:57.678
Okay, I'll check the bedroom, Chief.

26:57.798 --> 26:59.497
Strands of blond hair.

27:00.379 --> 27:01.612
Blond hair?

27:02.250 --> 27:05.803
- Rachel wasn't a blonde.
- Maybe the blood isn't hers, either.

27:06.206 --> 27:08.530
Did, uh... did Rachel have a roommate?

27:10.234 --> 27:11.259
Oh, my God.

27:11.919 --> 27:13.025
What is it?

27:13.442 --> 27:15.164
Rachel called me last week and asked

27:15.284 --> 27:18.025
if we had room available
for someone she'd just met.

27:18.145 --> 27:20.773
- We didn't.
- You said Rachel volunteers sometimes.

27:20.893 --> 27:22.729
She may have taken someone in.

27:24.609 --> 27:25.588
Thank you.

27:25.708 --> 27:27.860
Oh, for heaven sakes.
This one isn't like mine.

27:27.980 --> 27:30.029
- Chief, I got it.
- Oh, thank you.

27:31.397 --> 27:34.811
I need Rachel's schedule
for the night before last. Please.

27:37.513 --> 27:39.325
Ryan... haircut, 8:00.

27:40.884 --> 27:42.642
So, maybe he wasn't lying.

27:45.688 --> 27:47.972
So, Ryan Hughes kills his wife,

27:49.023 --> 27:51.643
somehow finds this address,
and then comes here.

27:51.763 --> 27:54.552
Fights with someone else, doesn't get
a scratch on him either time?

27:55.105 --> 27:56.805
But who does he fight with?

27:58.840 --> 28:01.142
I think we need to start looking
for another victim.

28:11.062 --> 28:12.635
- Kim Reynolds?
- Oh, yeah.

28:12.755 --> 28:15.957
I'm deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson,
and this is sergeant Gabriel.

28:16.077 --> 28:18.723
Hi. Yeah. I, uh, saw you yesterday,
but I've...

28:18.843 --> 28:21.152
already spoken
to that cute detective Sanchez.

28:21.272 --> 28:24.078
I was hoping that you could tell me
if Rachel Hughes had a roommate.

28:24.198 --> 28:26.771
Oh, um, I wouldn't know really.

28:27.242 --> 28:28.840
She and I weren't that close.

28:28.960 --> 28:31.287
Did you guys not get along or something?

28:31.407 --> 28:32.539
No. I mean,

28:32.659 --> 28:36.225
her whole relationship with Ryan
just drove me crazy. And...

28:36.345 --> 28:38.874
honestly, it was all she talked about.
I...

28:38.994 --> 28:40.191
I don't know.

28:40.626 --> 28:42.647
Maybe I should have paid more attention.

28:42.767 --> 28:44.561
Did Rachel tell you that she had moved?

28:44.721 --> 28:46.174
Yeah, yeah.

28:48.349 --> 28:50.382
Did she tell you where she moved?

28:50.502 --> 28:54.179
No, no, no. That was like some kind of,
like, "rule" or something.

28:54.299 --> 28:56.865
Like, nobody could know
where she lived.

28:57.591 --> 28:59.349
You know what, though?

28:59.469 --> 29:02.591
You guys should really talk to Lindsay.
She knew Rachel way better than me.

29:02.711 --> 29:04.389
- Is this Lindsay?
- Yeah.

29:04.509 --> 29:06.207
She's our new hair stylist.

29:06.367 --> 29:09.082
- Well, thank you. Thank you so much.
- Sure.

29:09.202 --> 29:11.291
- You were very helpful.
- Oh, I try.

29:11.744 --> 29:15.315
You know, actually, if you, um...
if you think of anything else,

29:16.132 --> 29:18.136
- you give me a call.
- Oh, okay, I will.

29:18.543 --> 29:20.138
- All right, thanks.
- Okay.

29:25.586 --> 29:27.190
- Pardon me.
- Lindsay?

29:28.115 --> 29:30.092
I'm deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.

29:30.212 --> 29:32.528
I understand that you were
friends with Rachel Hughes.

29:32.648 --> 29:34.539
Oh, uh, yeah.

29:35.717 --> 29:39.088
I... subbed for Rachel
when she was in the hospital.

29:40.702 --> 29:43.036
Did you spend a lot of time
with Rachel lately?

29:44.051 --> 29:46.544
Not really. Her hours were so extreme.

29:47.650 --> 29:48.756
Funny, I...

29:49.463 --> 29:52.811
I so wanted to be the head
of the hair department somewhere.

29:52.931 --> 29:54.425
Wish it wasn't here.

29:55.603 --> 29:56.462
Lindsay,

29:57.404 --> 30:00.095
do you always display
your cosmetology license?

30:00.255 --> 30:02.560
We're required to post it where we work.

30:02.680 --> 30:03.666
State law.

30:03.938 --> 30:04.899
Thank you.

30:05.260 --> 30:07.728
You were right, Chief.
Rachel's cosmetology license

30:07.848 --> 30:09.305
has her new address on it.

30:09.425 --> 30:12.920
And the card stock it was printed on
matches the same bit

30:13.264 --> 30:15.568
we found on her mirror
at the crime scene.

30:15.874 --> 30:18.947
Yeah, she had that license out
for the whole world to see.

30:19.107 --> 30:22.099
Yeah, but Lindsay told us she taped up
the bottom half of it in order

30:22.219 --> 30:24.274
- to hide her address.
- And someone ripped it down.

30:24.394 --> 30:27.106
Okay, so, we've got two crime scenes,
two victims,

30:27.226 --> 30:29.708
and a suspect who fought both
without one defensive wound.

30:29.868 --> 30:32.787
Well, maybe 'cause he was wearing these.
Sap gloves.

30:33.121 --> 30:35.088
We had them on the streets
back in the'80s.

30:35.248 --> 30:38.581
They'll leave the same square Marks
we found on Rachel's face.

30:38.701 --> 30:40.885
I knew those welts looked familiar.

30:43.196 --> 30:45.734
Embedded steel.
Protects your fists.

30:46.042 --> 30:49.231
Yeah, well, that explains
pretty boy's silk knuckles.

30:49.351 --> 30:53.101
All right, lieutenant Flynn, let's see
if we can track down the companies

30:53.221 --> 30:55.253
that make these gloves.
Maybe we'll get lucky,

30:55.373 --> 30:57.430
and one of them
will have an order for a Ryan Hughes.

30:57.550 --> 30:59.404
- You got it, Chief.
- Thank you.

31:02.176 --> 31:03.898
What the hell is he reading?

31:04.018 --> 31:06.494
A movie script.
His attorney brought it in for him.

31:06.654 --> 31:09.098
He's supposed to start
rehearsals for it tomorrow.

31:09.218 --> 31:11.875
Chief Johnson, I have something unusual

31:12.478 --> 31:13.627
to suggest to you.

31:13.964 --> 31:16.308
Given that the suspect
has lawyered up, and

31:16.428 --> 31:19.096
the circumstantial evidence
against him is so strong,

31:19.216 --> 31:22.480
I think that we should arrest
Mr. Hughes for murder right now

31:22.600 --> 31:24.638
and hand him over to the D.A.

31:25.253 --> 31:26.556
Without a confession?

31:27.682 --> 31:28.391
Why?

31:28.951 --> 31:31.020
Because of what Ramos
might write in thetimes?

31:31.140 --> 31:35.065
No, no, no. From the outside,
this crime looks all kind of showbiz-y.

31:35.225 --> 31:37.595
But the second...
the second we make an arrest,

31:37.715 --> 31:41.344
the murder becomes a domestic dispute
between a hair stylist

31:41.464 --> 31:43.283
and a wannabe actor, and...

31:43.664 --> 31:45.853
... that's not news in Los Angeles.

31:46.614 --> 31:49.732
Let me give you the whole picture here.
Ricardo Ramos is writing

31:49.852 --> 31:52.582
a two-part article, as we speak,
on priority homicide.

31:52.937 --> 31:56.637
Now, I have done everything I can
to kill this article

31:56.757 --> 32:00.951
on the basis that it's one-sided,
unfair, and bad for the city.

32:01.713 --> 32:03.217
Anyway, I failed.

32:03.562 --> 32:05.139
The article will come.

32:05.259 --> 32:07.601
- It will be terrible.
- Let me talk to Ramos.

32:07.721 --> 32:09.598
- I don't think that would be...
- No.

32:09.718 --> 32:11.066
Absolutely not.

32:11.719 --> 32:14.487
Then explain to him
that there is another crime scene

32:14.607 --> 32:16.856
associated with this so-called
hollywood victim

32:17.016 --> 32:20.610
and that if I give up today due
to unwarranted media pressure,

32:20.770 --> 32:22.846
then I'll be short a dead body
when we go to trial.

32:22.966 --> 32:24.596
Or tell him that...

32:27.697 --> 32:29.536
for Heaven's sakes.

32:31.485 --> 32:34.790
You know, I can't let Ramos
dictate how I do my job.

32:40.999 --> 32:44.681
- She just doesn't get it, does she?
- She doesn't want to get it.

32:49.496 --> 32:50.394
Hello.

32:51.016 --> 32:53.254
I'm deputy chief
Brenda Leigh Johnson.

32:53.374 --> 32:55.982
Dan Frye. I represent Mr. Hughes.

32:56.102 --> 32:59.033
And I've talked to my client,
and I'd like you to explain

32:59.153 --> 33:01.526
why he's still being held
without any charges being filed.

33:01.686 --> 33:04.773
Well, maybe there won't be any,
if I can get a few things explained.

33:04.893 --> 33:07.361
- Like what?
- Well, your client claimed

33:07.481 --> 33:10.172
that he didn't know Donna Taft,
from the support center

33:10.292 --> 33:12.037
for domestic violence,
when, in fact,

33:12.157 --> 33:15.248
he threatened Donna when she would
not tell him where his wife...

33:15.408 --> 33:18.072
Unrelated, no evidentiary value.
Next question.

33:20.646 --> 33:23.857
- What about these? Look familiar?
- Don't answer that.

33:26.878 --> 33:28.386
Who was living with Rachel?

33:32.399 --> 33:34.392
Mr..."Frye,"

33:35.211 --> 33:38.980
if I leave here without a believable
response, I am gonna arrest your client

33:39.140 --> 33:41.126
for murder. And guilty or not,

33:41.246 --> 33:44.406
this movie that starts rehearsing
tomorrow will have to find someone else

33:44.526 --> 33:48.407
to play the part. Or with a little
cooperation, the show can go on.

33:49.005 --> 33:50.311
It's your choice.

33:52.950 --> 33:56.466
<i>You can tell her that you didn't
know where Rachel was living.</i>

33:59.729 --> 34:03.065
I don't know where Rachel was living
or who was living with her.

34:03.445 --> 34:04.932
I didn't threaten Donna.

34:05.052 --> 34:07.650
We had a disagreement about what
she was saying to my wife, that's all.

34:07.770 --> 34:10.643
Another disagreement that you
conveniently forgot to tell me.

34:10.763 --> 34:13.690
- So you lied to me again.
- I loved my wife.

34:14.289 --> 34:16.935
- She was my world.
- So, then why won't you help me?

34:17.094 --> 34:19.139
'cause you keep treating me
like I'm a criminal!

34:19.259 --> 34:21.982
- Ryan, it's okay.
- You loved Rachel so much?

34:22.141 --> 34:24.482
Then what exactly are you doing
right now that could...

34:24.601 --> 34:26.945
possibly be more important
than helping me find her murderer?

34:27.105 --> 34:28.571
I am out here trying to work.

34:28.690 --> 34:32.944
I'm studying my part, hoping to God that
I get out of here in time to play it.

34:33.063 --> 34:36.735
More specifically, I am highlighting
my lines, which is what all actors do

34:36.855 --> 34:39.036
- they first get their script.
- Ryan, it's okay.

34:39.157 --> 34:41.226
Look, no more questions
about this homicide.

34:41.346 --> 34:43.076
You want to make an arrest?

35:02.434 --> 35:05.856
Lieutenant... those script pages
that we found at Rachel's apartment...

35:05.976 --> 35:08.044
- where are they?
- Got them right here.

35:08.164 --> 35:09.385
- Okay.
- Here you go.

35:09.505 --> 35:13.004
Who would play this role
where the words are all yellow?

35:20.755 --> 35:21.646
Hello.

35:22.655 --> 35:26.687
Callie Rivers? I'm deputy chief
Brenda Leigh Johnson of the L.A.P.D.

35:27.117 --> 35:27.822
Yes.

35:29.128 --> 35:32.177
Sorry for my appearance.
Slept in today.

35:32.337 --> 35:35.719
I understand you recently
guest-starred on "Trauma Unit."

35:36.371 --> 35:37.948
I did, yes.

35:38.329 --> 35:40.668
The episode hasn't aired yet, but yes.

35:40.788 --> 35:41.520
Why?

35:42.263 --> 35:44.964
Well, I was hoping that you'd be able
to answer a few questions

35:45.084 --> 35:47.372
about Rachel Hughes.
She was a hairdresser...

35:47.492 --> 35:49.903
yes, I heard
about what happened to her.

35:50.846 --> 35:54.074
So sorry. Unfortunately,
I didn't know her that well, so...

35:56.805 --> 35:57.841
You didn't?

35:58.756 --> 36:01.831
Because... we found some
of your things at her apartment.

36:02.725 --> 36:03.458
Oh.

36:04.574 --> 36:05.293
That.

36:07.140 --> 36:10.022
Well, I did stay with Rachel
very briefly,

36:10.142 --> 36:13.442
but she was never there. She worked
like, 16 hours a day on that show, so...

36:13.562 --> 36:15.436
Do you mind if we come in?

36:16.756 --> 36:17.919
Uh, w-well...

36:21.054 --> 36:23.375
Well, it's a mess right now.

36:25.478 --> 36:26.728
I understand.

36:31.351 --> 36:33.092
What do you want to know?

36:41.884 --> 36:43.814
Well, there's a lot, actually.

36:45.427 --> 36:47.597
Like why were you staying with Rachel?

36:47.959 --> 36:50.025
She... she said she...

36:50.804 --> 36:54.119
was afraid of her husband
and she wanted some company.

36:54.989 --> 36:56.494
It made her feel safe.

36:56.614 --> 36:58.633
So, she must have told you that...

36:59.322 --> 37:00.790
her husband beat her.

37:01.716 --> 37:03.383
Yeah, a little bit, yeah.

37:04.012 --> 37:05.722
Did she also explain to you

37:06.067 --> 37:08.893
how she got away from Ryan?
How she just walked out

37:09.474 --> 37:10.616
and left him?

37:28.156 --> 37:28.909
No!

37:32.669 --> 37:33.684
Let her go!

37:33.804 --> 37:36.239
- Please, no!
- You let her go now!

37:36.359 --> 37:38.766
I'll break her neck, I swear!
Do you hear me?!

37:38.886 --> 37:42.432
Back off! Back off! I mean it! Back off!

37:42.592 --> 37:44.367
- I'll kill her!
<i>- No!</i>

37:44.487 --> 37:47.771
I mean it. I will kill her.
I'll break her neck, I swear.

37:47.931 --> 37:49.167
Do you hear me?

37:49.811 --> 37:51.805
Let her go now! Now!

37:53.926 --> 37:55.153
Okay, okay.

37:56.754 --> 37:59.908
No, please. Please don't hurt him.
He didn't mean to kill her.

38:00.068 --> 38:01.533
Shut up, you stupid bitch!

38:02.856 --> 38:04.651
Shut up! Shut up!

38:08.658 --> 38:09.491
Easy!

38:16.325 --> 38:20.245
Whoever you are, you are under arrest
for the murder of Rachel Hughes.

38:24.485 --> 38:27.769
Considering the circumstances,
your lawyer requested that

38:27.929 --> 38:31.324
we offer you an explanation
of what happened to your wife, and...

38:32.085 --> 38:33.862
perhaps offer an apology.

38:33.982 --> 38:35.636
First, let's start with the murder.

38:35.756 --> 38:38.627
Your wife, having been
physically abused herself,

38:38.747 --> 38:42.096
recognized similar injuries
in Callie Rivers,

38:42.216 --> 38:45.026
a guest star on the aptly named
"Trauma Unit."

38:45.447 --> 38:48.999
Rachel then convinced Callie to run away
from her abusive boyfriend, Mark,

38:49.159 --> 38:51.251
just like she had run away from you.

38:51.601 --> 38:54.379
Looking for Callie,
Mark threatened your wife,

38:54.539 --> 38:56.881
very much like you confronted Donna.

38:57.831 --> 39:00.214
When Rachel stood up for Callie,

39:00.420 --> 39:02.449
refusing to tell Mark where she was,

39:02.569 --> 39:03.930
he beat her to death.

39:05.530 --> 39:06.962
Rachel was murdered

39:07.416 --> 39:08.893
protecting somebody else?

39:10.407 --> 39:11.639
Yeah, she was.

39:13.416 --> 39:15.065
And now to finish up here,

39:15.185 --> 39:18.420
on behalf of the entireL.A.P.D.,
allow me to say

39:19.290 --> 39:20.631
how sorry I am

39:21.193 --> 39:23.042
that you lied to us so much

39:23.162 --> 39:25.702
and that you knocked your wife
around to such an extent

39:25.862 --> 39:28.747
that we considered you
a suspect in her murder.

39:31.224 --> 39:33.565
- That's your apology?
- Mm-hmm.

39:38.053 --> 39:41.259
You people have no idea
what I'm going through, do you?

39:43.699 --> 39:44.733
Excuse me.

39:53.206 --> 39:55.065
I'd still like to arrest him.

39:57.175 --> 40:00.194
Odds are one day... we will.

40:05.520 --> 40:07.077
- Willie Ray?
- Hmm?

40:07.697 --> 40:10.937
- Don't forget your shampoos.
- Oh, thank you, honey.

40:11.741 --> 40:14.606
Just when I was wondering
what would make showering

40:14.726 --> 40:17.501
- in that RV any worse.
- There's nothing wrong

40:17.621 --> 40:19.256
with the shower in that RV.

40:19.567 --> 40:20.437
Daddy...

40:22.703 --> 40:26.533
I just want to say that Fritz and I
are gonna get married when we're ready

40:26.840 --> 40:28.527
and not one minute before.

40:29.542 --> 40:31.643
It's... it's our business,

40:31.803 --> 40:35.313
and I won't be rushed into
setting a date or a place by anyone.

40:35.473 --> 40:38.237
I'm not trying to rush you
into anything.

40:38.357 --> 40:41.768
You've been engaged over a year.
We couldn't rush you now

40:41.888 --> 40:44.898
- even if we wanted to.
- Just so I know it's been said,

40:45.333 --> 40:48.334
I want to tell you both...
but especially you, daddy,

40:48.657 --> 40:50.924
I'm gonna get married when I want

40:51.529 --> 40:53.042
and the way I want to.

40:54.026 --> 40:55.973
And the next time
we talk about my wedding,

40:56.093 --> 40:57.961
it had better be
because I brought it up.

41:07.951 --> 41:10.581
Well, so much for freedom of speech.

41:11.433 --> 41:13.768
Am I still allowed
to take y'all to dinner?

41:15.459 --> 41:17.851
- Yes. That would be very nice.
- Good.

41:18.227 --> 41:19.780
Well, go get dressed

41:20.310 --> 41:23.208
and try to treat the waiter
better than you do me.

41:50.617 --> 41:53.391
That was inspiring the way you stood up
to your father just now.

41:54.623 --> 41:56.353
You really think so?

41:56.513 --> 42:00.168
Sometimes the only way to deal with
a control freakis to lay down the law.

42:00.473 --> 42:02.413
I totally agree.
Which is why I'm saying

42:02.533 --> 42:04.893
I want to be married
by the end of january or february

42:05.013 --> 42:06.696
of next year at the latest.

42:06.856 --> 42:08.787
And the next time we talk about it,

42:08.907 --> 42:10.539
you better have a date in mind.
