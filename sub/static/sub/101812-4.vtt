Who do you think

19:57.283 --> 19:58.936
You've got that look.

19:58.980 --> 20:00.242
Well, take a look
at these photos.

20:00.286 --> 20:01.417
They're not
just casual shots

20:01.461 --> 20:03.202
of food and random people.

20:03.245 --> 20:05.029
DESI:
They're with all the owners
of the stalls.

20:05.073 --> 20:07.815
Like Mr. Lao had a personal
relationship with them.

20:07.858 --> 20:10.078
There's a shell corporation
that connects Mr. Lao

20:10.121 --> 20:11.993
to the license
of the Vietnamese market.

20:12.036 --> 20:13.995
But we're not sure
what that means yet, and...[beeping]

20:14.038 --> 20:15.779
Oh, you will
not believe this.

20:15.823 --> 20:17.433
Mr. Lao wasn't just a mailman.

20:17.477 --> 20:19.566
On paper,
he was a multimillionaire.

20:19.609 --> 20:21.568
All the land that
Vietnamese market sits on,

20:21.611 --> 20:24.223
Benjamin Charles Lao
inherited it 30 years ago.

20:24.266 --> 20:25.398
And he never sold it.

20:25.441 --> 20:26.573
He probably wanted

20:26.616 --> 20:27.791
to preserve it
for the community.

20:27.835 --> 20:28.879
He had offers.

20:28.923 --> 20:30.707
Over a dozen
real estate firms

20:30.751 --> 20:32.405
bidding on that property
over the years.

20:32.448 --> 20:33.841
Who made the last offer?

20:35.364 --> 20:36.583
Port Madison Inc.

20:36.626 --> 20:37.888
Some real estate firm

20:37.932 --> 20:39.586
out of Sacramento.[beeping]

20:39.629 --> 20:40.978
Whoa.

20:41.022 --> 20:42.415
There's all kinds of

20:42.458 --> 20:45.113
lawsuits and criminal
investigations around them.

20:45.156 --> 20:46.854
A massive land deal
they can buy up at auction.

20:46.897 --> 20:48.421
Sounds like a
motive to me.

20:48.464 --> 20:49.857
DESI:
But how does that help?

20:49.900 --> 20:51.250
We still need physical evidence
of the killer,

20:51.293 --> 20:52.425
and this whole place
has been scrubbed down

20:52.468 --> 20:54.601
to make it look
like a suicide.

Oxygenated bleach?

20:59.170 --> 21:00.868
No way.

21:17.537 --> 21:19.669
You know, I brought you
to meet my family

21:19.713 --> 21:21.845
so I could have
a little emotional backup.

21:21.889 --> 21:23.978
I thought you brought me here
for my objective opinion.

21:24.021 --> 21:25.806

Well, you're gonna

21:28.722 --> 21:30.376
And you're not gonna like it.

Perfect.

21:40.995 --> 21:42.213
You two nerds want
to fill me in?

21:42.257 --> 21:43.389
Oxygenated bleach is

21:43.432 --> 21:44.564
the only kind
that actually removes

21:44.607 --> 21:45.956
blood stains
completely.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.044
But it also stains

21:47.088 --> 21:49.003
certain types of fabric
and wood.

21:49.046 --> 21:51.353
Mr. Lao didn't have any wounds
that would bleed.

21:51.397 --> 21:53.094
So the blood that was cleaned up
must have come from the killer,

21:53.137 --> 21:54.791
which means
there was a struggle.

21:54.835 --> 21:56.793
Yes. So his DNA
is around here somewhere.

21:56.837 --> 21:59.056
We just got to find it.

21:59.100 --> 22:02.016
I've known you since
you were five years old.

22:02.059 --> 22:03.844
But before I get started,

22:03.887 --> 22:05.585
there's something
I must tell you.

22:05.628 --> 22:07.064
Your parents,

22:07.108 --> 22:09.763
your real mother and father,
are no longer with us.

22:09.806 --> 22:12.766
I'm sorry. They passed.

22:13.810 --> 22:15.377
Tell me about them.

22:15.421 --> 22:16.509
They were
Chinese nationals

22:16.552 --> 22:18.119
living here in
the United States.

22:18.162 --> 22:20.339
They had connections to the
Chinese Defense Ministry.

22:20.382 --> 22:22.341
Were they smart?

22:22.384 --> 22:24.430
They were, yes.
They were brilliant.

22:24.473 --> 22:26.649
They were kind.
They were generous.

22:26.693 --> 22:29.173
I would even call them heroes.

22:29.217 --> 22:31.262
They loved you.

22:31.306 --> 22:35.049
My partner Joshua and I were
counterintelligence to the FBI.

22:35.092 --> 22:38.357
Parents secretly came to
us with intel regarding

22:38.400 --> 22:40.576
a Chinese mole
in the Bureau.

22:40.620 --> 22:42.970
In exchange for that intel,
they wanted to defect.

22:43.013 --> 22:46.060
Instead, we convinced
them to work for us.

22:46.103 --> 22:48.062
My parents were spies?

22:48.105 --> 22:49.542
Yeah.

22:49.585 --> 22:51.544
And I regret it.

22:51.587 --> 22:54.460
Because if they defected,
they'd be alive today.

22:54.503 --> 22:56.331
But we needed their
help. We had a mole,

22:56.375 --> 22:58.159
but we didn't know who.

22:58.202 --> 23:01.118
Your parents were collecting
encrypted communication

23:01.162 --> 23:02.859
between themselves
and the mole.

23:02.903 --> 23:04.078
I think they
discovered the mole,

23:04.121 --> 23:05.558
but the mole
discovered them.

23:05.601 --> 23:06.994
They could have
called me or Joshua,

23:07.037 --> 23:09.170
but they didn't trust
anybody in the Bureau.

23:09.213 --> 23:11.172
So they picked you
up, and they bolted.

23:11.215 --> 23:14.131
They hid out for three days.
By the time I got to them,

23:14.175 --> 23:16.046
they were on the run again.

23:16.090 --> 23:18.092
When I finally found them...

23:20.311 --> 23:22.662
...it was too late.
[sighs]

23:22.705 --> 23:24.707
I tried to save
them, but...

23:26.143 --> 23:28.581
But the mole killed them.

23:28.624 --> 23:30.626
MASON:
Yeah.

23:32.193 --> 23:33.324
I put you in WITSEC.

23:33.368 --> 23:34.978
I buried your identity.

23:35.022 --> 23:37.720
I altered your file so
that no one in the Bureau,

23:37.764 --> 23:39.200
not even the traitor,
could find you.

23:39.243 --> 23:40.767
I even lost
touch with you.

23:40.810 --> 23:44.074
Then again, we never
found the mole, either.

23:44.118 --> 23:46.033
But if anybody's looking
for you, it's got to be him,

23:46.076 --> 23:48.165
and he'd be pretty high
up in the Bureau by now.

23:48.209 --> 23:51.299
You saved my life.

What does the mole
want with Eli,

23:53.780 --> 23:55.608
Mason? I mean,
what are they after?

23:55.651 --> 23:57.218
There's one loose end.

23:57.261 --> 23:59.525
The encrypted
communication between

23:59.568 --> 24:01.178
his parents and that mole.

24:01.222 --> 24:02.571
It's on a burner phone.

24:02.615 --> 24:05.313
Would expose his identity,
his entire network.

24:05.356 --> 24:07.054
We never found it.

24:07.097 --> 24:09.230
He was on the run with
his folks for three days.

24:09.273 --> 24:11.101
Hiding out. They
would have kept

24:11.145 --> 24:12.451
that phone as collateral.

24:12.494 --> 24:14.061
They would have
stashed it someplace.

24:14.104 --> 24:16.498
So, the mole thinks
Eli might remember where.

24:16.542 --> 24:18.805
I was five.
How am I supposed

24:18.848 --> 24:20.459
to remember where
my parents stashed a phone?

24:20.502 --> 24:22.069
We have to find that phone,

24:22.112 --> 24:23.897
or these people will
never stop hunting you.

24:23.940 --> 24:26.682
In psyops,
we learn that memories

24:26.726 --> 24:29.076
are deeply linked
to the amygdala,

24:29.119 --> 24:32.296
the physical senses--
sight, taste, smell.

24:32.340 --> 24:34.951
Recreating those
senses can...

24:34.995 --> 24:36.953
You can get even
deeper memories.

24:36.997 --> 24:38.651
If we take Eli

24:38.694 --> 24:40.304
back to the location where
his parents were murdered...

24:40.348 --> 24:43.960
Then you can walk him backwards
and help him remember where

24:44.004 --> 24:45.962
his parents might have
hidden that phone.

24:46.006 --> 24:47.529
That might work.

24:47.573 --> 24:49.226
I'll draw you a map.

24:49.270 --> 24:50.837
No, Mason.

24:50.880 --> 24:52.316
We can't solve this

24:52.360 --> 24:54.623
without you. I mean,
nobody knows this case

24:54.667 --> 24:57.147
better than you.I told you, I'm done.

24:58.192 --> 24:59.280
You owe us.

24:59.323 --> 25:01.151
You burned our servers.

25:01.195 --> 25:03.197
You killed Charlie.

25:03.240 --> 25:05.765
In payback for
the death of my son.

25:05.808 --> 25:08.071
And then I saved MacGyver,

25:08.115 --> 25:10.378
so in my book, you owe me.

25:10.421 --> 25:12.032
Think of your son.

25:12.075 --> 25:15.122
He's dead. I never stop
thinking about him.

Now Mr. Lao fights back,
grabs the killer,

26:49.564 --> 26:52.393
pushing him back through

Now, where do they go?

I loved it there

30:13.855 --> 30:15.291
'cause you could hear
the train whistle.

30:15.335 --> 30:16.640
MATTY:
A train whistle. Okay.

30:16.684 --> 30:18.860
Good. Think about outside

I wanted to go back

'Cause it was safe there.

30:25.345 --> 30:28.174
But my mom said no,

30:28.217 --> 30:29.958

30:41.709 --> 30:42.710
Go faster, go faster.

30:42.753 --> 30:43.885
They're gaining on us.

You.

31:06.342 --> 31:08.214
You were the one chasing us.

31:09.345 --> 31:10.781
You're the reason
my parents are dead.

31:10.825 --> 31:12.218
I'm the reason
you're still alive, kid.

31:12.261 --> 31:13.523
No, it was you!

31:13.567 --> 31:14.742
Listen to me. Listen to me.[Eli grunts]

31:14.785 --> 31:15.743
Yeah, I was there!

31:15.786 --> 31:16.918
Yes. Yes, I was there.

31:16.962 --> 31:18.354
I was alone without backup.

31:18.398 --> 31:19.921
Joshua was following one lead.
I was following

31:19.965 --> 31:21.531
the other.
By the time I got here,

31:21.575 --> 31:23.446
your parents were
already dead. I had

31:23.490 --> 31:25.535
one split-second decision
to make: save you

31:25.579 --> 31:26.928
or chase that SUV.No, no, you're lying.

31:26.972 --> 31:29.017
You're lying!Save... save you
or chase that SUV.

keeping surveillance

on your brother, and
when he didn't go home,

31:52.736 --> 31:53.781
it rang alarm bells.[line rings]

31:53.824 --> 31:56.131
[phone rings][sighs] Hello?

31:56.175 --> 31:57.959
Mom, listen, you and Dad
need to lock the doors

31:58.003 --> 31:59.308
and hide until I get there,
okay?

31:59.352 --> 32:01.049
Where's Simon?

32:01.093 --> 32:03.791
Is he with you?I'll explain everything later,
okay? I promise.

32:03.834 --> 32:05.184

in Pinecliff and this location.

32:13.801 --> 32:14.976
He said he'd been to
that ice cream parlor

32:15.020 --> 32:17.239
several times.Copy that.

32:19.111 --> 32:22.027
Eli said he wanted to go back
to the yellow brick building.

32:22.070 --> 32:23.942
That's a place
where he felt safe

32:23.985 --> 32:25.726
during the chaos.
That must have been

32:25.769 --> 32:27.902
where the family was hiding out
during this ordeal.

32:27.946 --> 32:30.513
Okay, adding to the search.

within driving range.

32:39.609 --> 32:41.960
They must have been at
the Pinecliff Road Apartments.

32:42.003 --> 32:43.135
The building's closed now.

32:43.178 --> 32:44.788
It's being refitted for condos.

32:44.832 --> 32:47.966
Located near a creamery
that's since been closed down

32:48.009 --> 32:49.619

from a train station.

that big old brain of yours,

No need to apologize.

on the phone was very upsetting!

34:01.039 --> 34:02.388
And why is he barricading
my door?!

34:02.431 --> 34:04.346
There are some violent people
after us. After you.
