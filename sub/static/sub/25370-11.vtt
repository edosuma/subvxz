WEBVTT

00:04.765 --> 00:06.218
This is for Marie.

00:07.124 --> 00:08.957
You're a fucking rat!

00:09.044 --> 00:10.965
- Everything OK?
- I was in the showers

00:11.034 --> 00:13.311
and I-I heard the whole thing!
You hurt Cherry.

00:13.399 --> 00:16.014
- There was a fucking witness!
- Cherry was the rat.

00:16.102 --> 00:18.217
- I was protecting you.
- You've done enough.

00:20.248 --> 00:21.317
500K?!

00:21.404 --> 00:23.200
Where the fuck are
we gonna get 500K from?

00:23.288 --> 00:25.203
Even if we did pay,
do you think that'd be the end of it?

00:25.290 --> 00:26.553
Blackmailers don't stop.

00:26.676 --> 00:27.936
This was under her mattress.

00:28.024 --> 00:29.246
- There's blood on it.
- Slot her.

00:29.334 --> 00:30.568
Someone planted it! No!

00:30.655 --> 00:31.733
You framed Jenkins.

00:31.821 --> 00:34.742
Do not touch Birdsworth.

00:34.912 --> 00:37.162
I am the one who goes down
if she talks.

00:37.249 --> 00:38.488
I decide now.

00:38.576 --> 00:40.765
But if she doesn't do something,
we'll both wind up in prison.

00:40.852 --> 00:42.999
I'll go down for conspiracy,
but you fucking killed her, mate.

00:43.086 --> 00:45.717
You'll get life. Tell Vera
to pay up, you dumb fuck!

00:45.805 --> 00:47.208
- Ugh!
- Ugh! Ya, fu...!

00:47.295 --> 00:49.254
- I'd like a transfer.
- What's wrong with H3?

00:49.313 --> 00:50.629
Liz isn't in it.

00:50.717 --> 00:52.124
I want to stick close,
keep an eye on her.

00:52.211 --> 00:54.139
Surely that's in your
best interests, too?

00:54.233 --> 00:55.451
Liz?

00:55.539 --> 00:57.423
I just wanna die!

00:57.511 --> 01:00.040
- Who gave you the hotshot?
- It was Marie.

01:03.341 --> 01:04.730
Where's the rest of your stash?

01:04.818 --> 01:07.748
It's laced with rat poison,
you can't take it. So hand it over.

01:10.850 --> 01:12.618
Marie, can you hear me?!

01:12.920 --> 01:14.818
Oh, shit. Marie!?

01:15.964 --> 01:17.584
Six, seven...

I know what you did.

02:18.225 --> 02:19.889
You raped her,
you pig.

02:21.615 --> 02:23.497
She wasn't complaining.

02:28.943 --> 02:32.240
I know I did!
I know I did!

02:32.769 --> 02:34.787
Argh! Argh!

02:34.881 --> 02:36.586
What the fuck, oh!

02:36.803 --> 02:39.064
Oh, shit! Oh!

02:48.317 --> 02:50.248
Try and eat something,
OK?

02:50.568 --> 02:52.371
- Thanks.
- I better get back there.

02:52.459 --> 02:56.066
Hey, can you make sure Taylah
flushes the rest of that gear?

02:56.154 --> 02:58.996
'Cause I don't want any other girls
shovin' rat poison in their veins.

02:59.084 --> 03:00.226
- Yeah, we will.
- <i>Attention, compound.</i>

03:00.313 --> 03:04.107
<i>Attention, compound.
H Block are now called for breakfast.</i>

03:04.920 --> 03:06.152
How's Marie?

03:06.294 --> 03:09.342
- What do you care?
- I heard it was touch-and-go.

03:09.687 --> 03:11.111
Sugartits!

03:11.592 --> 03:13.903
I woke up alone and thought
you escaped without me!

03:14.045 --> 03:16.079
Just wanted to make sure
Marie was OK.

03:16.342 --> 03:19.095
Oh, whatever.
Serves her right, eh?

03:19.182 --> 03:21.154
- ODing on that rubbish.
- Yeah.

03:21.287 --> 03:23.803
She must have
the constitution of an ox.

03:26.196 --> 03:27.543
How's she goin', anyway?

03:27.631 --> 03:30.012
Yeah, actually, she got
some really good news.

03:30.100 --> 03:33.680
Someone on the outside got CCTV
photos of that prick that hit Danny.

03:33.767 --> 03:35.879
- Oh, true?
- Yeah, so if he was at the bar,

03:35.967 --> 03:37.864
- they might be able to ID him.
- Great!

03:38.350 --> 03:39.473
Hey, you comin' to brekkie?

03:39.561 --> 03:42.674
Ah, no, I gotta go find Taylah,
but save me a seat anyway. Nice?

03:45.651 --> 03:46.928
Oi.

03:52.670 --> 03:53.730
I'm fucked.

03:53.818 --> 03:56.390
- Marie's getting photos in.
- More photos from the pub?

03:56.508 --> 03:58.459
I dunno.
Of me hitting Danny.

03:58.607 --> 04:01.436
They're from the...
the cameras in the car park, I guess.

04:01.529 --> 04:02.785
She's gonna know it's me.

04:02.873 --> 04:04.857
- No, it's not gonna show you.
- How do you know?

04:05.006 --> 04:07.013
Well, photos like that
are shit quality.

04:07.101 --> 04:09.184
Unless it's a close up of
your face it could be anyone.

04:09.271 --> 04:10.800
Well, what if it does show
my face?

04:10.888 --> 04:12.277
You would have been arrested
already.

04:12.364 --> 04:14.231
But it'll show what
I'm wearing.

04:20.505 --> 04:21.690
You'll be right.

04:21.877 --> 04:23.707
Go eat your breakfast.

05:02.029 --> 05:03.193
Taylah?

05:03.579 --> 05:04.969
What'd I do?

05:05.685 --> 05:07.418
I got a message from Marie.

05:07.719 --> 05:10.005
That gear she gave you,
it's laced with rat poison.

05:10.093 --> 05:12.216
- Come on. We've got to flush it.
- There's none left.

05:13.907 --> 05:16.529
What? You used it all?

05:17.748 --> 05:19.769
- What, so you flushed it?
- Bullshit!

05:20.136 --> 05:21.416
Where's the rest of it?

05:22.152 --> 05:24.114
Taylah, what the fuck
did you do with that gear?

05:24.202 --> 05:26.143
I didn't do nothin' with it,
all right?

05:26.366 --> 05:27.653
I told Kaz
where I stashed it

05:27.741 --> 05:29.370
and she said
she'd get rid of it for me.

05:32.167 --> 05:33.197
Here we go.

05:33.285 --> 05:35.465
Thanks, love. Good-oh.

05:37.434 --> 05:39.496
Ooh...
what's that flavour?

05:39.857 --> 05:41.650
The usual. Camomile.

05:41.846 --> 05:43.512
- Is it? Mm.
- Yep.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.981
Fuck me! Hm!

05:46.288 --> 05:47.606
Good to see you out.

05:47.927 --> 05:49.390
I copped a charge!

05:49.478 --> 05:51.965
With my shit record,
I'm looking at six to ten.

05:52.110 --> 05:53.846
They're saying
Cherry's paralysed, eh?

05:53.934 --> 05:56.570
- All right, Booms, calm down.
- How can I calm down?

05:56.658 --> 05:59.429
Some dog is saying
I bashed her!

06:03.203 --> 06:04.808
Do you know who it was?

06:06.074 --> 06:07.463
Marie.

06:08.511 --> 06:10.046
She set you up.

06:10.584 --> 06:11.833
- Right.
- I've already punished her,

06:11.920 --> 06:13.488
- she's in medical.
- Yeah?

06:13.684 --> 06:15.496
Well I'm gonna
put her in the fuckin' morgue.

06:16.078 --> 06:18.254
Do that and you'll cop
another charge.

06:18.342 --> 06:19.910
Let me handle it.

06:24.124 --> 06:27.268
Stop acting like children.
No more cheap shots.

06:27.378 --> 06:30.197
Sticking together is the only
way we're gonna get through this.

06:32.068 --> 06:35.669
I told Will about Derek
Channing blackmailing you.

06:35.886 --> 06:37.705
Yet another inglorious chapter
in the life

06:37.792 --> 06:39.033
and times of Jake Stewart.

06:39.121 --> 06:40.758
What was that about
cheap shots?

06:42.905 --> 06:44.540
The more I think about it,

06:44.628 --> 06:45.795
the more it makes sense.

06:45.883 --> 06:47.701
Channing knew
Ferguson had it in for me.

06:47.789 --> 06:49.848
And he'd be pretty pissed off,
taking the fall for everything.

06:49.935 --> 06:51.280
How would Channing know
what I did?

06:51.367 --> 06:52.350
He was here
during the escape.

06:52.438 --> 06:55.084
Well, maybe you weren't as careful
as you thought. Either way...

06:55.312 --> 06:57.550
- we have to do something about him.
- Like what?

06:58.819 --> 07:00.341
Bury him on top of Ferguson?

07:00.429 --> 07:02.277
- Oh, for Christ's sake, Jake!
- Fucking hell, mate.

07:02.364 --> 07:04.334
What then?
Pay him off?

07:04.440 --> 07:06.588
Let's make sure
it's him first.

07:06.754 --> 07:07.954
How?

07:12.721 --> 07:14.552
Are you sure
this is the right place?

07:14.834 --> 07:16.865
It's a bit weird for Channing.

07:17.413 --> 07:19.873
Well, it's the address
his wife gave me.

07:20.264 --> 07:22.475
Apparently he went off the rails
after losing his job.

07:23.784 --> 07:26.624
- Depression, got heavily into coke.
- She told you that?

07:26.782 --> 07:27.928
Yeah.

07:28.225 --> 07:29.693
No love lost there.

07:34.397 --> 07:36.537
Oh, hang on.

07:37.092 --> 07:39.428
- I have to get this. OK.
- I'll go check it out.

07:55.953 --> 07:57.021
Vera?

07:57.153 --> 07:58.334
They're not numbered.

07:58.422 --> 08:00.459
Just gonna see
if I can spot the car.

08:05.983 --> 08:07.419
All right.
See you then. Bye.

08:28.257 --> 08:29.662
Will?

09:25.235 --> 09:26.584
Vera.

09:29.161 --> 09:30.600
What are you doin' here?

09:31.506 --> 09:32.903
- I'm...
- Vera?

09:32.991 --> 09:34.191
Will!

09:34.957 --> 09:36.596
Fuck! No!

09:41.512 --> 09:44.423
- Don't... don't... argh! Argh!
- Will!

09:44.510 --> 09:47.296
Wait... no!

09:47.592 --> 09:49.789
Get off me!

09:49.876 --> 09:51.100
Vera?!

09:51.187 --> 09:53.064
You ready?

09:55.863 --> 09:57.191
Ah?!

09:57.600 --> 09:59.086
You want a piece of this, do ya?

09:59.226 --> 10:01.687
Ya! Ya! Ya! Oh!

10:01.775 --> 10:03.743
- Who...?! What do you want?!
- Stop fighting me!

10:03.831 --> 10:06.986
What, eh?! What do
you want from me, huh?!

10:07.850 --> 10:09.694
What...
what do you want from me?

10:26.332 --> 10:28.569
Go on, say it.

10:29.070 --> 10:31.300
How the mighty have fallen.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.540
But not you, Vera, no,

10:34.657 --> 10:36.302
you're Teflon.

10:37.079 --> 10:40.112
I hope I didn't crumple that
neatly pressed uniform of yours.

10:40.200 --> 10:42.014
So this is where
you live.

10:43.672 --> 10:44.882
I love fishing.

10:44.970 --> 10:46.998
Doesn't look like you've
been doing too much of it.

10:47.291 --> 10:49.898
Well, that's because
my work keeps me busy.

10:49.993 --> 10:52.827
Yeah, and what work
would that be, Derek?

10:52.915 --> 10:54.423
Take a look around, Vera.

10:54.713 --> 10:56.368
We know what you're doing,
Derek.

10:56.456 --> 10:58.956
But here's the thing,
blackmailing Vera's not gonna work.

10:59.044 --> 11:01.547
- What are you bloody talking about?
- Breaking into Vera's house,

11:01.634 --> 11:03.445
leaving the gloves on her pillow.

11:03.559 --> 11:05.987
Tryin' to make her think that
Ferguson is still stalking her.

11:06.106 --> 11:08.405
Ferguson is stalking you?
Wh-wh-when did this happen?

11:08.493 --> 11:10.562
Just cut the bullshit,
OK, we know it's you!

11:10.650 --> 11:14.265
So so-someone is
blackmailing you? For what?

11:14.353 --> 11:15.879
What game are you playing?

11:16.021 --> 11:18.631
I'm not playing any games,
Vera.

11:18.859 --> 11:20.674
This is serious business.

11:20.942 --> 11:22.367
I'm hunting her.

11:22.589 --> 11:25.155
- Hunting her?
- Yeah.

11:25.269 --> 11:27.013
That bitch is out there
somewhere

11:27.147 --> 11:29.839
and she has destroyed
my fuckin' life.

11:30.245 --> 11:32.022
I'm gonna hunt her down
like a dog,

11:32.110 --> 11:36.476
- and when I fuckin' find her...
- So you think Ferguson is still here?

11:36.646 --> 11:39.334
Ha-ha! 'Course she's still here!

11:39.524 --> 11:41.647
She's a fuckin' cockroach!

11:43.827 --> 11:46.084
Now, I don't know how
the hell she escaped...

11:47.419 --> 11:49.435
but she's not gonna
get away.

11:52.067 --> 11:54.421
Now, these gloves...

11:55.542 --> 11:57.350
the gloves in your house...

11:57.803 --> 11:59.304
how long ago was that?

11:59.790 --> 12:01.179
A week ago.

12:01.376 --> 12:03.448
- Week ago?
- Hmm.

12:08.651 --> 12:09.893
A week.

12:09.980 --> 12:11.604
All right,
so if that was a week ago

12:11.692 --> 12:13.893
she could be somewhere
between here and...

12:13.981 --> 12:15.901
He's seriously unhinged.

12:16.026 --> 12:18.466
Coked to the eyeballs.
You think he's bluffing?

12:18.554 --> 12:20.716
No. And if he thinks
Fergusson is alive

12:20.804 --> 12:22.588
then he can't be
the blackmailer.

12:47.329 --> 12:48.763
Popular with these blokes.

12:48.851 --> 12:50.283
Must have your finger
in a few pies?

12:50.371 --> 12:52.002
We've both got a bit
in common then.

12:54.799 --> 12:55.918
Rita,

12:56.006 --> 12:57.971
we'd like to talk to you
about your biker licks.

12:58.059 --> 12:59.182
Whatever.

13:03.030 --> 13:04.616
So, what do you got for us?

13:04.704 --> 13:06.627
I think
Marie's protector is a cop.

13:06.715 --> 13:08.192
She's got photos coming in,

13:08.280 --> 13:11.001
CCTV from the car park
where her son was bashed.

13:11.089 --> 13:12.219
Danny Winter.

13:12.307 --> 13:14.573
The photos were too low
res to ID the attacker,

13:14.661 --> 13:16.254
- so they were never sent out.
- Hmm.

13:16.342 --> 13:18.432
Only a cop could have
access to 'em.

13:20.584 --> 13:21.988
- What?
- Well, they were sent

13:22.076 --> 13:24.338
to a private imaging company
to try to enhance 'em.

13:24.426 --> 13:25.908
That's a lot more hands
on them.

13:25.996 --> 13:27.523
Cop and civilian.

13:27.876 --> 13:30.260
- So is that all you've got for us?
- Yeah.

13:30.584 --> 13:31.895
Right.

13:33.262 --> 13:36.471
Just out of interest,
did the imaging give us anything new?

13:36.633 --> 13:37.759
Uh, yeah.

13:37.847 --> 13:40.640
Turned up a tattoo on the
back of the guy's head, here.

13:40.882 --> 13:43.182
Above the hairline,
where the perp's head was shaved.

13:43.439 --> 13:45.033
Double shafted arrow.

13:45.746 --> 13:47.049
Thanks.

13:59.641 --> 14:01.158
- What's wrong?
- Turn around.

14:01.370 --> 14:03.678
Oh! Oi!
What the hell?!

14:04.139 --> 14:06.112
- Fuck!
- Yeah, fuck's right!

14:06.200 --> 14:07.760
'Ere, no-one goes
touchin' me like that!

14:07.848 --> 14:08.899
Has Allie?

14:08.987 --> 14:11.027
Has Allie seen that tattoo
on the back of your neck?

14:11.557 --> 14:14.283
- Answer me! Has Allie seen it?!
- Oh, I don't... I don't know.

14:14.371 --> 14:16.455
- N-no. Why?
- Are you sure?

14:16.714 --> 14:19.033
- Are you sure, Ru?
- Yes, I'm sure!

14:19.159 --> 14:20.596
She would have said
somethin'.

14:21.705 --> 14:23.298
What's goin' on, Rita?

14:24.191 --> 14:26.635
Hello!
What the fuck is goin' on?!

14:26.813 --> 14:29.664
Those photos,
the ones that Marie's gettin' in?

14:29.880 --> 14:33.019
They show that tattoo.
The back of your head.

14:34.224 --> 14:35.640
How do you know?

14:36.330 --> 14:38.525
Uh, one of my biker
mates with the Conquerors,

14:38.613 --> 14:40.609
he's got, uh,
links with the cops.

14:40.821 --> 14:42.406
Oh, shit!

14:42.982 --> 14:44.201
What am I gonna do?

14:44.289 --> 14:46.382
- Break up with Allie for a start.
- What?!

14:46.649 --> 14:47.992
You can't risk her seein' it.

14:48.080 --> 14:50.669
If Allie sees it and
tells Marie, you're dead.

14:51.085 --> 14:52.891
Fuck her off!

15:07.585 --> 15:09.258
I know
you had Cherry bashed...

15:09.346 --> 15:11.620
and that you framed
Boomer for it.

15:11.901 --> 15:13.221
Wow.
You seem to know a lot.

15:13.309 --> 15:16.321
You're gonna tell the Governor
and you're gonna exonerate Boomer.

15:16.409 --> 15:20.115
And if I don't confess,
Boomer will what...

15:20.289 --> 15:22.680
- punch my tits in?
- Boomer won't come for you.

15:23.175 --> 15:24.266
I will.

15:26.391 --> 15:27.461
Hey...

15:28.202 --> 15:29.750
I'm gettin' outta here
soon...

15:30.272 --> 15:33.774
so go find someone else to involve
in your bullshit power games.

15:39.002 --> 15:40.180
Morning.

15:50.151 --> 15:52.767
Could you call the deputy
governor and Officer Stewart

15:52.855 --> 15:54.350
- to my office, please?
- Sure.

16:10.531 --> 16:13.844
- Whoa, shit.
- You are fucking kidding me!

16:15.882 --> 16:18.414
We've got no choice now.
We have to pay the money.

16:18.992 --> 16:21.785
What? You got any better ideas?
'Cause I'd really love to hear them!

16:22.508 --> 16:23.797
Vera?

16:25.353 --> 16:27.594
Sierra 1 calling Sierra 2.

16:27.682 --> 16:28.930
Oh, fucking hell.

16:31.236 --> 16:32.852
This is Sierra 2. Go ahead.

16:33.028 --> 16:35.530
Governor, we've got Derek
Channing at the gatehouse.

16:35.618 --> 16:37.037
He's asking to see you.

16:37.457 --> 16:39.188
I thought you said
it couldn't be him.

16:39.610 --> 16:40.797
Sierra 1,

16:40.891 --> 16:43.008
issue Mr Channing
a visitor's pass and send him up.

16:43.096 --> 16:45.414
- <i>Copy that.</i>
- Why is he here?

16:45.619 --> 16:46.970
I don't know.

16:48.811 --> 16:49.992
I'm staying.

16:50.286 --> 16:51.531
No.

16:52.364 --> 16:53.678
I'll see him alone.

17:07.190 --> 17:09.461
'Scuse me, Governor,
Mr Channing to see you.

17:11.820 --> 17:13.031
Vera...

17:14.143 --> 17:15.930
long time no see.

17:17.738 --> 17:19.114
What do you want?

17:19.500 --> 17:20.984
My life back.

17:21.815 --> 17:23.025
Luckily...

17:23.113 --> 17:25.563
- you're in a position to give it to me.
- How?

17:25.766 --> 17:29.860
Well, after you and Will left
yesterday, I had an epiphany.

17:30.367 --> 17:32.563
I always knew
in my bones that

17:32.728 --> 17:35.734
<i>bitch</i>
had inside help to escape

17:35.976 --> 17:38.192
and I believe
that help was you.

17:39.804 --> 17:41.875
- Me?
- Hmm.

17:42.573 --> 17:44.110
And now you're being blackmailed

17:44.198 --> 17:46.781
by somebody
who's threatening to expose you.

17:50.881 --> 17:52.906
I'm right, aren't I?

17:53.782 --> 17:55.605
I fuckin' knew it!

17:55.693 --> 17:57.500
It's Ferguson, Vera!

17:57.900 --> 17:59.031
Ferguson?

17:59.119 --> 18:01.201
I-I can't believe you
haven't figured it out.

18:01.449 --> 18:03.367
I mean, you were desperate
to get rid of her,

18:03.491 --> 18:05.091
so you helped her escape,

18:05.264 --> 18:07.091
then she blackmails you
for it.

18:07.194 --> 18:12.000
That's fuckin' genius, in a... in
a twisted, fucked-up, psychotic way!

18:12.942 --> 18:14.250
So here's the deal...

18:14.338 --> 18:17.104
you're gonna go to the police and
you're gonna tell 'em everything...

18:17.324 --> 18:18.829
and I...

18:19.563 --> 18:21.977
will be totally exonerated.

18:25.641 --> 18:27.275
And why would I do that?

18:27.487 --> 18:30.313
Because, in exchange,
I'll keep Will Jackson out of it.

18:30.423 --> 18:33.438
It's obvious he's an accessory
after the fact and I know...

18:33.650 --> 18:36.773
well, I know you have a
soft spot for the big fella.

18:36.900 --> 18:38.922
I'm sure you wouldn't
want to drop him in it.

18:41.884 --> 18:43.098
So...

18:43.506 --> 18:46.227
I'm going to give you a day
to come to terms with it.

18:53.045 --> 18:55.016
I'm sure you'll do the
right thing, Vera...

18:55.258 --> 18:57.930
because, <i>fuck</i>...

18:59.591 --> 19:02.008
that's just the sort of person
you are.

19:16.010 --> 19:17.791
I'm surprised to see you here,
Derek.

19:17.915 --> 19:19.671
Get used to it,
honey bun.

19:20.330 --> 19:22.112
What's that prick doin' back?

19:22.200 --> 19:23.758
That's fuckin' Channing!

19:31.402 --> 19:33.732
<i>- Keep walkin' dickhead!
- Ya fuckin' dog!</i>

19:43.644 --> 19:45.144
Go on, piss off.

19:58.614 --> 20:00.443
Thought you were
my friend?

20:03.513 --> 20:04.974
Yeah, I am.

20:06.317 --> 20:08.135
Why, is there something wrong,
Boomer?

20:08.832 --> 20:10.275
You know what's wrong!

20:10.386 --> 20:12.818
You dobbed on me,
didn't ya? Yeah?

20:12.906 --> 20:15.420
- No.
- You told the screws that I bashed Cherry.

20:15.508 --> 20:17.225
- No.
- Yeah!

20:17.747 --> 20:20.271
Who told you that? Kaz?

20:20.938 --> 20:23.069
- She lied to you.
- No.

20:25.201 --> 20:27.998
No, you... you set me up.

20:28.569 --> 20:31.382
You planted that
battery stick in me cell.

20:32.185 --> 20:33.333
- Now, Boomer...
- Mm-hm?

20:33.421 --> 20:35.799
Kaz told you it was
me because she hates me

20:35.887 --> 20:39.279
and she's protecting the person who
really told the screws it was you.

20:40.455 --> 20:41.688
Who?

20:42.160 --> 20:43.591
Who's she fuckin' protectin'?

20:43.938 --> 20:47.138
Surely you can work
that one out. Hmm?

20:47.518 --> 20:49.340
It's Liz.

20:51.291 --> 20:52.607
Liz?

20:56.185 --> 20:58.315
- She just makes shit up, you know?!
- I know!

20:58.403 --> 21:00.919
I know she does,
but, unfortunately for us,

21:01.035 --> 21:03.177
people believe
what she says.

21:04.643 --> 21:06.159
Yeah...

21:07.766 --> 21:09.115
Yeah.

21:13.041 --> 21:14.662
I say we call his bluff.

21:14.872 --> 21:16.949
Let Channing go to the
police, see who they believe.

21:17.037 --> 21:19.537
There's only one problem with
that, even though it wasn't me,

21:19.625 --> 21:21.648
there was an officer involved,

21:21.846 --> 21:23.577
which makes it too close
to the truth for comfort,

21:23.664 --> 21:26.993
especially if,
<i>when</i> the police decide to investigate.

21:30.334 --> 21:31.749
<i>Attention, compound.</i>

21:31.837 --> 21:35.185
<i>Work detail will
commence in ten minutes.</i>

21:40.427 --> 21:43.271
- Bwah! Wrong door, oops!
- Shit!

21:43.359 --> 21:46.589
- Jenkins! Jenkins, open that door!
- Fuck it! Fuck it!

21:47.702 --> 21:49.408
- Jenkins, open this door now!
- Fuck it! Fuck!

21:49.495 --> 21:51.417
Can you... Just open it!

21:51.504 --> 21:53.067
- Fuck it!
- Do it, open the door!

21:53.268 --> 21:55.107
- Do it!
- Attention, compound!

21:55.195 --> 21:58.187
Attention, compound! I've got an
important announcement to make!

21:58.850 --> 22:00.888
I didn't bash Cherry!

22:01.171 --> 22:04.093
And you can't believe a
word Liz Birdsworth says,

22:04.195 --> 22:06.815
- 'cause Liz Birdsworth has got the dementia.
- What?!

22:06.903 --> 22:10.396
I repeat, Liz Birdsworth
has got the dementia.

22:13.435 --> 22:14.927
Liz!

22:15.818 --> 22:17.727
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

22:18.032 --> 22:19.343
That is enough!

22:19.431 --> 22:20.622
- So, like...
- Jenkins!

22:20.710 --> 22:23.208
It's not her fault,
right, 'cause she's sick...

22:23.524 --> 22:25.906
but you just can't believe a
word that comes out of her mouth

22:25.993 --> 22:27.983
'cause she can't help talking shit!

22:28.071 --> 22:30.897
Susan Jenkins speaking.
Over and out.

22:30.985 --> 22:33.460
She'll be pissing herself next.

22:33.802 --> 22:36.561
- Open it!
- I have to do everything?!

22:36.680 --> 22:38.928
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, all
right, all right, all right.

22:39.043 --> 22:40.345
Don't have to hurt me.

22:40.463 --> 22:43.786
- Fuckin' idiot.
- You're a fuckin' idiot!

22:53.358 --> 22:56.570
Surprised to see you here, Boomer.
I thought you'd be in the slot.

22:56.797 --> 22:59.796
Well, the slot doesn't
seem to work for Jenkins,

22:59.899 --> 23:02.709
so I have decided
to suspend privileges.

23:02.797 --> 23:04.866
No phones, no visitors,

23:04.954 --> 23:08.369
no special spends and no
Monte Carlos for a month.

23:08.457 --> 23:10.349
And Jenkins has also assured me

23:10.437 --> 23:12.863
that she will help to repair
the damage she has done

23:12.951 --> 23:16.098
by revealing Birdsworth's condition
to the wider prison population.

23:16.258 --> 23:18.163
But you gotta look
into Cherry's bashin'.

23:18.265 --> 23:21.275
That is a police matter,
but I will do what I can.

23:21.363 --> 23:23.502
But I've got Sonia's
lawyer working on my parole.

23:23.590 --> 23:25.285
I don't want that fucked up,
all right?

23:25.373 --> 23:27.085
Even a dumb-arse'd
know that!

23:29.079 --> 23:31.490
Oh, I wasn't saying
you're a dumb-arse.

23:31.701 --> 23:33.390
I... and... uh...

23:34.713 --> 23:37.317
Oh, shit, shit, shit.

23:37.955 --> 23:39.225
I was set up.

23:39.313 --> 23:41.467
- That's what I'm saying, I was set up.
- OK...

23:42.046 --> 23:45.599
right, so if you think you
can still manage the situation,

23:45.912 --> 23:47.950
I will leave it to you
as to how Jenkins

23:48.038 --> 23:49.962
can best repair the damage
she has done.

23:50.050 --> 23:53.174
- That horse has bolted.
- Mmm, horses bolt, Proctor.

23:53.851 --> 23:55.616
Was gonna happen
sooner or later.

24:07.606 --> 24:09.014
Mr Stewart?

24:09.913 --> 24:12.852
- What is it, Novak?
- I saw Channing here before.

24:13.166 --> 24:14.788
What's that creep doing here?

24:15.273 --> 24:16.725
Is it about Ferguson?

24:17.714 --> 24:18.991
Well, what does he know?

24:19.585 --> 24:21.193
We're dealing with it, OK?

24:21.281 --> 24:23.342
If you need any dirt
on him, let me know.

24:23.682 --> 24:25.179
I'll talk to Marie.

24:29.794 --> 24:31.621
How are you feeling?

24:31.802 --> 24:34.086
Pissed off. I mean, things
are fallin' to shit out there,

24:34.174 --> 24:36.211
there's fuckin' rat poison
in my gear...

24:37.506 --> 24:40.090
Christ, my parole
can't come soon enough.

24:40.450 --> 24:41.874
Got the photos.

24:43.627 --> 24:45.449
Shows the prick who did it.

24:52.537 --> 24:54.166
Yeah, but you can't see
his face.

24:54.254 --> 24:56.024
No, he's wearing a dark hoodie.

24:56.180 --> 24:58.194
We'll match it to the
photos from the bar.

25:20.394 --> 25:21.513
Did you do it?

25:21.678 --> 25:24.107
- D'you break up with Allie?
- I can't.

25:24.577 --> 25:25.696
I love her

25:25.791 --> 25:27.273
and I trust her.
She wouldn't dob on me.

25:27.360 --> 25:28.592
You don't know that.

25:28.680 --> 25:31.280
- I think I can fix this.
- How?

25:31.466 --> 25:33.086
There's still this.

25:37.019 --> 25:39.257
We will find the
prick, Marie, I promise.

25:39.375 --> 25:40.917
And when we do...

25:41.460 --> 25:43.369
- I'll kill him.
- No.

25:44.164 --> 25:46.604
That, I wanna do myself.

26:02.897 --> 26:05.165
You ready?
On the count of three.

26:05.654 --> 26:07.066
One...

26:19.895 --> 26:21.733
I told you I'd handle it.

26:22.043 --> 26:23.397
I'll sort Marie out.

26:23.485 --> 26:27.983
Yeah, well, just sayin' you'll
sort Marie out means jack shit.

26:28.690 --> 26:30.545
All right? I had to do
what I done!

26:30.633 --> 26:33.170
What fucking right do you
have to betray that confidence,

26:33.258 --> 26:34.662
to treat Liz like that?

26:34.750 --> 26:37.425
People had to know
she's losing her marbles, right?

26:37.524 --> 26:40.630
- She said I bashed Cherry!
- Only to me, nobody else,

26:40.718 --> 26:43.444
and only because Marie
got it into her head.

26:45.356 --> 26:47.191
Is that true? Like...

26:47.293 --> 26:49.382
did you only tell Kaz?

26:49.681 --> 26:50.897
I think so.

26:51.284 --> 26:52.919
I'm... I-I mean, yeah,

26:53.007 --> 26:54.834
and... and it's 'cause
I was confused.

26:54.922 --> 26:56.922
I wouldn't dob on ya,
love.

26:59.325 --> 27:00.780
Oh, fuck.

27:01.767 --> 27:02.967
Oh...

27:05.228 --> 27:06.926
I'm... I'm sorry.

27:07.411 --> 27:09.436
And I'm... I'm...
I'm sorry you're sick

27:10.004 --> 27:12.259
and I'm sorry
I told the whole prison.

27:13.651 --> 27:15.539
- It's OK.
- Mmm...

27:16.050 --> 27:17.595
It's all right.

27:17.795 --> 27:19.928
No, it's probably
for the best anyway.

27:20.573 --> 27:21.773
Hey...

27:22.750 --> 27:25.068
I'm sorry
you lost your Monte Carlos.

27:25.311 --> 27:27.530
No, it's all right,
I've got a secret stash anyway,

27:27.618 --> 27:30.022
- so don't worry about it.
- Oh, you little bugger!

27:32.259 --> 27:33.809
What are you gonna do
to Marie?

27:34.538 --> 27:36.670
What I should've done
a long time ago.

27:36.932 --> 27:39.981
You are the only one
keeping this vendetta alive.

27:40.069 --> 27:42.658
You're fighting a battle
from ten years ago!

27:42.793 --> 27:44.337
Oh, it's all one-sided, is it?

27:44.425 --> 27:47.134
Marie is just fucked up
about her son!

27:47.395 --> 27:49.853
She doesn't wanna get involved
in your bullshit power games.

27:49.941 --> 27:52.603
Right, so trying to kill Liz,
what was that about?

27:53.937 --> 27:55.103
What?

27:55.298 --> 27:57.603
She tried to get Liz to
top herself with a hot shot.

27:57.691 --> 27:59.384
I stopped Liz.

27:59.935 --> 28:01.639
So you tell me, Allie...

28:02.047 --> 28:03.949
what do you think
I should do about that?

28:05.204 --> 28:08.697
Don't you think poisoning
Marie is punishment enough?

28:08.831 --> 28:12.970
Just quietly, no.
You need to pick a side, bubba.

28:14.426 --> 28:16.134
I'm not gonna
do that again.

28:43.201 --> 28:44.630
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:44.718 --> 28:46.607
Come in, I wanna show you something.

28:52.150 --> 28:53.982
Oh, Marie.

28:57.672 --> 28:58.834
Oh.

29:04.129 --> 29:05.396
What's this?

29:06.298 --> 29:08.412
That's a tattoo
on the bastard's head.

29:09.166 --> 29:11.114
Did this help you
find out who it is?

29:11.583 --> 29:12.783
No.

29:15.895 --> 29:18.865
No. It's hopeless.

29:30.310 --> 29:32.342
You need to stay away from Kaz.

29:33.128 --> 29:36.559
She can't let this grudge go.
She won't let it go.

29:36.840 --> 29:38.795
I think she's gonna
try and come for you.

29:39.223 --> 29:41.271
Come on,
I'm not afraid of her.

29:45.134 --> 29:46.747
Well, you should be.

29:50.362 --> 29:52.160
She's already tried once.

29:54.012 --> 29:55.412
That gear?

29:58.123 --> 29:59.995
She poisoned me?

30:06.377 --> 30:08.060
Listen, just promise me.

30:08.172 --> 30:10.850
OK? You've only got a short
time left in here. Just...

30:11.426 --> 30:13.201
stay away from Kaz.

30:26.743 --> 30:29.889
- How's the pain?
- Oh, only hurts when I breathe.

30:30.275 --> 30:31.678
It's gonna take a while to heal.

30:31.935 --> 30:34.578
Well, lucky I have a
head full of scars, eh?

30:34.688 --> 30:36.482
It won't look out of place,
then.

30:37.724 --> 30:39.521
Still gonna need to be careful.

30:41.347 --> 30:42.552
I'll leave you to it, then.

30:42.640 --> 30:44.349
Hey, stranger,
where you been?

30:44.502 --> 30:47.310
- What, you been missin' me?
- Yeah, actually, I have.

30:47.398 --> 30:48.826
- Oi, Liz?
- Yeah?

30:48.914 --> 30:51.256
- Got that 50 you owe me?
- What?

30:51.344 --> 30:53.432
Oh, don't tell me
you don't remember.

30:54.067 --> 30:56.608
- Oh... knock it off, all right?
- Juice said you promised

30:56.696 --> 31:00.006
- to munch on her furburger.
- Shut your fucking mouth!

31:00.094 --> 31:01.428
Or you'll what?

31:03.095 --> 31:04.834
Or you'll what, Kaz?

31:05.222 --> 31:07.533
Slip them some gear
laced with rat poison?

31:07.689 --> 31:08.997
What the fuck?!

31:17.011 --> 31:18.849
If I wasn't getting outta here...

31:19.030 --> 31:21.835
I would slit
your fucking throat!

31:27.787 --> 31:29.460
<i>Bring it on.</i>

31:37.629 --> 31:39.285
Oh!

31:41.543 --> 31:44.363
- Fuckin' hell!
- You've made your choice.

31:48.387 --> 31:50.582
Still reckon
she wouldn't dog ya?

32:02.932 --> 32:04.972
- You crossed Kaz.
- What?

32:05.127 --> 32:07.895
Kaz is your best friend and
you picked Marie over her.

32:08.257 --> 32:09.933
No... no, no, no, it-it...

32:10.042 --> 32:11.930
- it wasn't a choice.
- What is it, then?

32:13.309 --> 32:15.464
Kaz tried to kill Marie!

32:15.687 --> 32:18.390
So, what,
you told Marie everything?

32:18.703 --> 32:22.144
I tried to warn her,
I-I didn't want anybody to get hurt.

32:22.353 --> 32:24.652
I didn't think that she
would call Kaz on it!

32:26.012 --> 32:27.505
That's the thing, eh?

32:28.215 --> 32:29.724
The people you love...

32:30.245 --> 32:31.648
they surprise ya.

32:34.381 --> 32:35.906
I can't trust ya.

32:36.399 --> 32:37.811
Oh, what?!

32:38.189 --> 32:39.394
That's it.

32:40.636 --> 32:41.755
We're done.

32:41.843 --> 32:43.248
- Ruby...
- We're done!

32:51.341 --> 32:53.222
Oh, fu...

33:31.973 --> 33:33.427
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:33.515 --> 33:35.031
Nice surprise.

33:35.417 --> 33:36.701
No.

33:37.202 --> 33:38.428
Derek Channing.

33:38.610 --> 33:39.800
Shit.

33:40.002 --> 33:41.907
That's a blast from the past.

33:41.998 --> 33:43.808
I need some information
to control him.

33:44.005 --> 33:45.386
Heard you might be able
to help.

33:45.666 --> 33:47.090
Maybe.

33:47.308 --> 33:48.761
What's in it for me?

33:49.224 --> 33:50.526
Please.

33:53.337 --> 33:57.285
OK. But I'll need access
to a computer and a printer.

33:57.373 --> 33:58.780
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

34:01.611 --> 34:03.161
Out you go.

34:03.498 --> 34:05.307
Oh! Yes.

34:27.503 --> 34:29.931
- Great. Thank you.
- Let's go.

34:47.668 --> 34:49.509
Thank you, Miss Miles.

34:50.136 --> 34:51.335
Will...

34:51.702 --> 34:53.358
it's good that
you're here, too.

34:54.228 --> 34:56.489
You'll be pleased to know
that when this all blows over,

34:56.578 --> 34:58.469
I'll be keeping you on
as my deputy.

34:58.700 --> 35:00.577
It's gonna blow over
a lot quicker than you think.

35:00.664 --> 35:01.850
Hm.

35:01.938 --> 35:05.076
So, Vera, will you be
calling the police or shall I?

35:05.744 --> 35:07.686
No, I won't be calling
the police, Derek.

35:08.586 --> 35:10.106
Uh, and neither will you.

35:15.162 --> 35:17.455
Well,
what fucked up game is this?

35:17.543 --> 35:18.623
It's just a...

35:18.711 --> 35:21.545
it's a lot of technical paperwork
that I don't really understand...

35:21.789 --> 35:24.748
detailing your co-ownership

35:24.836 --> 35:27.881
of a number of illegal brothels.

35:31.643 --> 35:33.326
Ooh, don't need to be a technical genius

35:33.414 --> 35:35.398
to understand
what's going on there.

35:40.660 --> 35:42.607
So Ferguson gave you this, did she?

35:43.021 --> 35:45.436
Well, I can't possibly
reveal my sources, Derek.

35:46.739 --> 35:48.856
That psycho bitch!

35:49.916 --> 35:52.053
She's still fucking with me!

35:56.219 --> 35:59.019
Miss Miles, would you escort
Mr Channing out, please?

36:03.239 --> 36:05.473
Make sure
he returns his visitor's pass.

36:15.162 --> 36:16.537
Oh, Jesus.

36:20.027 --> 36:22.547
- So when are you coming back?
- Fuck off, Linda!

36:22.925 --> 36:25.352
Should I ask
where you got all this?

36:25.918 --> 36:27.161
No.

36:29.667 --> 36:31.266
So what do we do now?

36:31.822 --> 36:33.746
I think we have to pay
the ransom.

36:36.081 --> 36:37.998
Flush them out.

36:48.784 --> 36:50.064
Marie?

37:08.153 --> 37:12.215
- Who's that guy behind you?
- I don't know. I can't remember.

37:12.696 --> 37:14.291
Fuck.

37:22.899 --> 37:24.801
- Rodney.
- Hello, Marie.

37:24.948 --> 37:26.935
Mwah! Mm!

37:27.451 --> 37:31.336
So, I trust you have
good news about my parole.

37:31.484 --> 37:34.398
Uh... I'm afraid I...

37:34.704 --> 37:37.692
I have less than
cheery news, Marie.

37:38.197 --> 37:40.223
Chamberlain, the doctor you assaulted...

37:40.616 --> 37:43.776
last week he was out walking
his dog, he dropped dead.

37:44.700 --> 37:46.945
Autopsy report came back
a couple of days ago,

37:47.033 --> 37:48.676
died of a brain bleed.

37:50.070 --> 37:52.078
- What?
- A bleed just beneath

37:52.166 --> 37:53.887
the spot where you
struck him in the head.

37:56.924 --> 37:58.614
So, um...

37:58.984 --> 38:01.629
The DPP wants to pursue
a manslaughter charge

38:01.717 --> 38:04.331
against you, they're asking
for a minimum 10-year sentence.

38:04.513 --> 38:07.364
Eh... we will fight it. OK,
it's not a fait accompli.

38:07.452 --> 38:10.052
- We're going to move...
- What are my chances of being convicted?

38:11.916 --> 38:13.559
There's a precedence for...

38:13.762 --> 38:14.799
delayed homicide

38:14.887 --> 38:17.452
- proximate to a cause...
- Just give it to me straight, Rodney.

38:22.404 --> 38:23.724
You're fucked.

38:39.378 --> 38:41.432
- Marie?
- You fuckin' hypocrite!

38:41.653 --> 38:42.933
What are you doing?!

38:44.442 --> 38:45.561
No!

38:45.649 --> 38:47.698
You tried to poison me!

38:47.786 --> 38:48.987
Cut that out!

38:49.075 --> 38:51.266
- Here, Kaz! Kaz! Kaz!
- What?!

38:51.775 --> 38:53.220
Thanks. Fuck!

38:54.520 --> 38:55.955
Kaz, fuckin' roll her!

38:56.042 --> 38:58.337
- Kaz...!
- Fuck her up!

38:59.012 --> 39:00.717
Good luck now, big slut!

39:03.566 --> 39:06.224
- You're fucked!
- Show her who's Top Dog!

39:06.312 --> 39:08.841
- Kaz, don't do this!
- Get her!

39:10.799 --> 39:11.918
Come on, Kaz!

39:12.006 --> 39:13.390
Yeah, do it.

39:16.514 --> 39:18.499
- You're dead.
- Am I?

39:19.463 --> 39:22.692
- Push it, Kaz!
- Marie, stop!

39:25.210 --> 39:28.202
- Come on! Come on!
- You know what the wins are, stab her!

39:28.290 --> 39:29.915
- Ugh!
- Argh!

39:30.549 --> 39:32.668
- Yes!
- Fuckin' rough!

39:39.400 --> 39:41.611
Ha! Ja!

39:42.269 --> 39:43.724
- Fuckin' you!
- Break it up!

39:43.864 --> 39:45.616
- Grab 'em!
- Proctor!

39:45.704 --> 39:47.850
- Move back, ladies! Get back!
- Proctor, get here!

39:47.938 --> 39:48.975
- Argh! Come on!
- Argh!

39:49.087 --> 39:50.481
- Give it here, Proctor!
- Drop it.

39:50.569 --> 39:52.038
Let it go! Come on!

39:52.253 --> 39:54.936
- Boomer, take care of Liz!
- OK!

39:55.024 --> 39:58.011
- Argh, fuck!
- Back to your units, let's go!

40:07.116 --> 40:08.538
What was the alarm?

40:08.626 --> 40:11.835
Some shit-fight in the
laundry. Make this quick.

40:38.369 --> 40:40.647
Move through, ladies.
Back to your unit.

40:45.553 --> 40:46.753
Hey!

40:47.342 --> 40:48.497
Where's Marie?

40:48.585 --> 40:50.771
- She's in the slot.
- Why?

40:50.859 --> 40:52.474
She attacked Kaz.

40:55.289 --> 40:57.513
Hurry up. Move through.

41:05.248 --> 41:08.279

42:43.199 --> 42:45.909
Bea Smith's grave?
What the fuck?!

42:47.637 --> 42:49.230
You still want to go through with that?

42:50.497 --> 42:52.215
Do we have a choice?

44:21.618 --> 44:22.916
Over there.

44:48.712 --> 44:50.126
Oh!

44:50.665 --> 44:53.235
- Ugh!
- Drop the gun! Drop it!

44:53.459 --> 44:55.369
- Let go!
- Get him!

44:56.050 --> 44:57.743
Get off!

44:57.831 --> 44:59.197
- Drop it!
- Ugh!

44:59.285 --> 45:00.578
You let me go!

45:00.744 --> 45:02.474
I thought you said
it couldn't be him.

45:03.486 --> 45:06.798
- I'm not the fuckin' blackmailer!
- So what are you doin' here?!

45:07.192 --> 45:08.891
I was following Vera.

45:10.137 --> 45:12.258
I'm here to get Ferguson.

45:15.713 --> 45:17.368
- Shit...
- Fuck!

45:20.266 --> 45:22.079
Oh, shit...!

45:27.254 --> 45:28.461
Whoa!

45:56.309 --> 45:59.213
- Ballan 4-8-9.
- <i>Go ahead, 4-8-9.</i>

45:59.301 --> 46:00.957
We're at the
coordinates you gave us...

46:01.045 --> 46:02.223
<i>Go ahead.</i>

46:02.311 --> 46:03.809
Looks like
the tip-off was good.
