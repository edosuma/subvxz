05:29.955 --> 05:30.672
guy put his hand in my pocket.

05:30.872 --> 05:31.668
I said, "What do you want?"

05:31.873 --> 05:32.624
He says, "I want a match."

05:32.833 --> 05:33.834
I say, "Why don't you ask me?"

Hiya, Chuck, how
come you're so late?

06:25.010 --> 06:26.557
I don't know, I just
couldn't get out of bed.

06:26.761 --> 06:28.041
It's been a
madhouse all morning.

06:28.138 --> 06:30.232
I believe it, I was...

06:30.432 --> 06:31.934
How come you look
so tired, Chuck?

06:32.142 --> 06:34.986
I don't know, I just
couldn't get out of bed.

06:35.186 --> 06:36.733
What's happening, Mabe?

06:36.938 --> 06:38.235
An 85-year-old actress named

06:39.608 --> 06:41.360
Ethel Niche was
up here yesterday.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.411
We don't need any
85-year-old actresses.

06:43.612 --> 06:44.829
She don't want to act,

06:45.030 --> 06:46.907
she says she thinks
you made her pregnant.

06:47.115 --> 06:48.458
I made her pregnant?

06:48.658 --> 06:49.750
She said it was either you

06:49.951 --> 06:51.953
or Julius Irving of the
Philadelphia 76ers.

06:52.162 --> 06:54.085
She left a picture,
recognize her?

06:54.289 --> 06:56.007
I never slept with her.

06:56.207 --> 06:57.584
Oh, and one more thing.

06:57.792 --> 06:58.918
Mr. Didlo is in
your office, he says

06:59.127 --> 07:00.219
he's got to speak to you.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.637
He says it's very important.

07:04.007 --> 07:06.886
Mr. Didlo, presenting the star

07:07.093 --> 07:09.095
and host of the
show, Chuck Barrie.

07:09.304 --> 07:10.851
Okay, baby.

07:12.057 --> 07:14.981
I told you that you do not
have to announce me like that.

07:15.185 --> 07:16.983
Well, you are the host
and star of the show,

07:17.187 --> 07:18.467
and that's how
you get announced,

07:18.605 --> 07:19.322
ain't that right, mama?

07:19.522 --> 07:20.522
That's right.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.493
Hey, Buddy.

07:23.693 --> 07:24.693
Buddy?

07:24.861 --> 07:26.113
Charles, there's been slippage.

07:26.321 --> 07:27.321
Pardon?

07:27.405 --> 07:28.702
I said there's been slippage.

07:28.907 --> 07:31.251
And as network vice president
in charge of programs,

07:31.451 --> 07:33.749
it is incumbent upon me to
bring this to your attention.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.002
What's slippage?

07:36.206 --> 07:38.129
A drop in ratings.

07:39.501 --> 07:41.094
Oh, damn.

07:42.837 --> 07:44.760
The Gong Show ratings are down,

07:44.965 --> 07:47.889
just a teense, but
down, just the same.

07:49.427 --> 07:53.022
Due to the wildness of you
and Jaye P. Morgan, I suspect.

07:54.391 --> 07:56.439
I thought The Gong
Show ratings were up.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.941
They are, but I
can smell slippage.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.944
And Charles, comes
at a bad time.

08:02.148 --> 08:05.368
Of course, there never is
a good time for slippage,

08:05.568 --> 08:08.538
but certainly not at
contract renewal time.

08:08.738 --> 08:11.036
My contract's up for renewal?

08:11.241 --> 08:13.835
Yes, and because of
the impending slippage,

08:14.035 --> 08:15.878
you will not be getting a
salary increase this year.

08:16.079 --> 08:18.457
I didn't get any salary
increases last year.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.884
And you aren't going to
get any this year, either.

08:21.042 --> 08:22.043
Oh, and

08:22.877 --> 08:24.595
no more limousines
to the studio.

08:24.796 --> 08:26.844
I never take a
limousine anywhere.

08:27.048 --> 08:29.392
You never take a
limousine to the studio?

08:29.592 --> 08:30.592
How do you get there?

08:30.760 --> 08:31.807
I drive my car.

08:32.011 --> 08:35.107
Oh, how gross.

08:36.390 --> 08:39.440
You should take a limousine,
it's good for the image.

08:39.644 --> 08:42.022
All right, I'll start
taking limousines.

08:42.230 --> 08:45.200
No, you can't, not this
year, too much slippage.

08:46.484 --> 08:47.484
Wait a minute, Buddy.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.654
I've got auditions and I'm late.

08:49.863 --> 08:52.207
I'll see you later, all right?

08:55.869 --> 08:57.337
Primadonnas.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.415
Give 'em a little
celebrity status,

09:00.665 --> 09:03.384
and they all become primadonnas.

09:03.585 --> 09:05.212
Hey, good morning.

09:05.420 --> 09:07.013
Good morning!

09:07.213 --> 09:08.573
Hey, I'm sorry to
keep you waiting.

09:08.757 --> 09:09.757
Go ahead and do it.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.026
I've got to stop and tune up.

09:20.226 --> 09:21.352
I had a cockroach.

09:21.561 --> 09:22.778
A cockroach is in your ear?

09:22.979 --> 09:23.605
Yeah.

09:23.813 --> 09:24.814
For how long?

09:25.023 --> 09:26.821
It's, it must have
been three years.

09:27.025 --> 09:29.073
Oh, yeah, I like that.

09:29.277 --> 09:30.824
That's good.

09:36.159 --> 09:37.661
I mean, I totally
cannot even believe

09:37.869 --> 09:39.997
Morris the cat is dead and they
keep showing the commercials.

09:40.205 --> 09:41.925
It just like totally
bums me out to the max.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.674
One more time before you
go, I kind of like that.

09:51.007 --> 09:52.008
Very good, all right.

09:52.217 --> 09:53.844
Well, thank you,
you can take your

09:54.052 --> 09:55.972
little musical schlong
and go right out the door.

09:56.137 --> 09:57.229
My name is Janey
Need-to-hand-me.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.228
I think, that's
what they told me.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.106
Anyway, I don't believe, so I
changed it to Insaney Janey.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.358
Yeah, that's me, my
man called me Magic,

10:04.562 --> 10:05.688
and this is what he say.

10:05.897 --> 10:07.537
Lady Magic has captured
my heart and mind,

10:07.690 --> 10:09.363
and made set in
a different time.

10:09.567 --> 10:11.444
Then he makes it like
a fire, what I say,

10:11.653 --> 10:13.951
once he's caught in her
web, you can't get away.

10:14.155 --> 10:15.998

quicksand, I must admit,

could do that on television?

10:34.050 --> 10:35.973
I did it before and they had me.

12:28.039 --> 12:30.337
Your cardiovascular system.

12:30.541 --> 12:32.839
That's what I'm working on,
my cardiovascular system.

12:33.044 --> 12:34.421
I work out like crazy.

12:34.629 --> 12:35.846
You enjoy that?

12:36.047 --> 12:37.047
I hate it.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.433
Then why do you do it?

12:38.633 --> 12:39.680
I just got divorced.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.557
What's that got to do with it?

12:45.181 --> 12:48.310
I am hawking every
22-year-old broad in this town.

12:49.978 --> 12:51.321
Well, it's not exactly right,

12:51.521 --> 12:53.865
I mean, I'm not hawking
every 22-year-old broad.

12:54.065 --> 12:56.739
I'm hawking every 22-year-old
broad in my building.

12:58.069 --> 12:59.742
I'm hawking my secretary.

13:00.863 --> 13:02.160
She is something else.

13:03.366 --> 13:04.868
Every time I throw her a hop,

13:05.076 --> 13:07.295
she goes into the kitchen
and eats a piece of cheese.

13:07.495 --> 13:08.667
Cheese?

13:09.789 --> 13:11.883
And it don't make any
difference what kind.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.041
It could be, uh,

13:13.167 --> 13:16.592
American, Swiss, Camembert,
she likes cheese.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.757
Then she comes
out of the kitchen

13:19.966 --> 13:22.719
and I gotta hawk her again,
like I'm some kind of fountain.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.645
That's really rough, Bernie.

13:24.846 --> 13:26.189
You're damn right it is.

13:26.389 --> 13:28.391
And if I can't do it,
you know what she does?

13:28.599 --> 13:31.694
She grabs me by my canipes,
like they're subway pants

13:31.894 --> 13:34.864
and jumps up and down
like a filled high.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.149
What's a canipe?

13:38.401 --> 13:41.780
These, these things,
these are canipes.

13:42.947 --> 13:45.075
I always call them love handles.

13:45.283 --> 13:47.877
Well, you call them love
handles, I call them canipes.

13:48.077 --> 13:49.875
I'm telling you,

13:50.079 --> 13:52.798
she treats me like
a Chinese dinner.

13:52.999 --> 13:56.549
15 minutes after she hawks me,
she's ready to hawk me again.

13:56.711 --> 13:58.964
I am terrified
every time she goes

13:59.172 --> 14:01.550
into the kitchen for
a piece of cheese.

14:01.758 --> 14:03.385
You know what I mean, Chuck?

14:03.593 --> 14:04.765
Chuck?

14:08.389 --> 14:11.359
So, what are you up to
tonight, Chuckie baby?

14:11.559 --> 14:12.856
Big Premiere?

14:13.061 --> 14:15.735
Dinner with some movie star?

14:15.938 --> 14:18.361
Bang a few starlets?

14:19.942 --> 14:21.615
You're not going
to believe this, Ed.

14:23.071 --> 14:24.823
I'm going to go home and sleep.

14:25.031 --> 14:28.251
I've got to tape five
Gong Shows tomorrow.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.205
Yeah, sure, Chuckie.

14:32.413 --> 14:36.543
Here come the Gold
Dinghies, do it!

14:47.804 --> 14:50.182
All right, November's going
to be a good month for you.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.142
December's going
to be a good month.

14:52.350 --> 14:53.943
January, you will die.

14:54.143 --> 14:56.396
February will be a good month.

15:00.483 --> 15:02.281
A cow, listen to this, listen,

15:02.485 --> 15:04.613
you listen, a cow
goes up to a priest.

15:04.821 --> 15:06.994
The cow goes, "Moo
me, father, more.

15:07.198 --> 15:09.917
"Mish-mack-uh, priest,
mish-mack-uh, father."

15:10.118 --> 15:11.836
And the priest,
"Oh, for certain,

15:12.036 --> 15:13.959
cow was my fay-schpook."

15:16.582 --> 15:18.334
Are you making sport
of me or something?

15:18.543 --> 15:21.843
Listen, I'm a talented
man, I've been on TV a lot.

15:22.046 --> 15:23.468
Whaddya talking about?

15:28.428 --> 15:30.851
To prove that this is no
ordinary ventriloquist act,

15:31.055 --> 15:32.853
I now am going to have
Sad Sack sing a song

15:33.057 --> 15:34.525
while I drink this water.

15:34.725 --> 15:38.070
Shake, shake, shake,
shake your baggies.

15:45.027 --> 15:47.029
That's a marvelous little duck.

15:47.238 --> 15:49.411
That is animal
crackers, and, Phyllis?

15:49.615 --> 15:51.333
Ow, Jesus.

15:51.534 --> 15:52.956
Wakey, master.

15:53.161 --> 15:56.040
Remember, Pearl Harbor.

15:57.206 --> 16:00.130
That dastardly stab in the back.

16:00.334 --> 16:02.014
I think it's time to
expose you're no good,

16:02.086 --> 16:03.086
what do you say?

16:03.212 --> 16:04.384
Yes, let's...

18:04.333 --> 18:05.550
All right.

18:05.710 --> 18:06.927
HEY, I was gonged!

18:07.128 --> 18:09.631
Yeah, a few losers,
now get off the stage.

18:11.132 --> 18:13.134
Come on back,
Melvin, come on back.

18:13.342 --> 18:15.891
Let's hear it for Melvin Presar.

18:17.305 --> 18:18.477
Get off the stage.

18:22.768 --> 18:25.021
All right, all right.

18:25.229 --> 18:26.481
Yeah, that was pretty good.

18:26.689 --> 18:29.238
Hey, one more time, Melvin!

18:29.442 --> 18:31.444
Melvin, one more time!

18:33.029 --> 18:34.872
At least it's a nice hospital.

18:35.072 --> 18:36.824
I have never seen
a nice hospital.

18:37.033 --> 18:38.910
You know I gave Presar
his heart attack.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.541
I'm responsible, I did it.

18:41.746 --> 18:44.966
I kept making him do
encore after encore.

18:45.166 --> 18:48.716
Oh, come on, Bo, don't
be so hard on yourself.

18:48.919 --> 18:50.887
Melvin loved doing his chicken.

18:51.088 --> 18:54.012
And if he wasn't having fun,
you would have made him stop.

18:54.216 --> 18:55.843
That's not true,
that's not true.

18:56.052 --> 18:58.976
I kept going for the laughs,
without thinking about him.

18:59.180 --> 19:01.023
I gave him his heart attack,

19:01.223 --> 19:03.567
and I'll never forgive myself.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.173
Excuse me.

19:46.811 --> 19:47.903
Excuse me?

19:48.104 --> 19:51.074
Well, if it isn't
old Chuck Barrie.

19:51.273 --> 19:52.695
What can I do for you?

19:52.900 --> 19:54.368
I would like to
see Melvin Presar,

19:54.568 --> 19:55.911
I understand he's on this floor?

19:56.112 --> 19:58.285
You know, I watch that
stupid show of yours

19:58.489 --> 20:00.332
every day before I go to work?

20:00.533 --> 20:04.879
First, I put on the coffee,
then I put on my TV,

20:05.079 --> 20:06.922
and then I watch
your stupid show.

20:07.123 --> 20:08.921
That is the dumbest thing.

20:09.125 --> 20:11.753
Here, can I see
Mr. Presar, please?

20:11.919 --> 20:15.014
Oh, you're here to say
goodbye to Mr. Presar.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.057
Okay, follow me.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.061
Goodbye?

20:20.261 --> 20:22.229
Isn't Mr. Presar going to live?

20:22.430 --> 20:24.933
Oh, he's alive,
but he won't survive.

20:25.141 --> 20:29.692
I'm right, 19 out of 20,
and I call 'em as I see 'em.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.272
Oh, here we are.

20:31.480 --> 20:34.950
Now, the sickly
fool is only allowed

20:35.151 --> 20:37.870
one visitor for
just five minutes.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.788
That is, if he's still living.

20:39.989 --> 20:41.829
It wouldn't matter how
long you stayed in there

20:41.866 --> 20:43.038
if he was dead, now would it?

20:46.078 --> 20:48.627
Well, by the way, if he should

20:48.831 --> 20:50.959
happen to die while
you're in there,

20:51.167 --> 20:53.966
just come and get me and I'll
take care of it from there.

21:03.179 --> 21:04.396
Melvin?

21:04.597 --> 21:05.894
Melvin?

21:08.017 --> 21:09.064
Chuck?

21:09.268 --> 21:10.770
Hiya, Melvin.

21:10.978 --> 21:14.027
Chuck, it's so nice of you
to take the time to come.

21:14.231 --> 21:16.029
I know you're very busy,

21:16.233 --> 21:17.985
and have so many things to do,

21:18.194 --> 21:20.322
and you have a lot on your mind.

21:20.529 --> 21:23.032
How you doing, you old goat?

21:23.240 --> 21:25.117
Is the nurse around?

21:25.326 --> 21:26.293
Do you need her, I'll get her.

21:26.494 --> 21:28.292
No, no, don't get her.

21:28.496 --> 21:30.464
Just see if she's in the hall.

21:30.664 --> 21:32.837
She's predicted that I'll kick.

21:33.042 --> 21:36.387
She has a 19 out of
20 record, you know.

21:37.880 --> 21:40.303
I want to make sure
she's not around.

21:40.508 --> 21:41.508
Sure.

21:50.267 --> 21:52.019
She's not out there.

21:52.228 --> 21:53.775
Good, good.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.481
Could you come
over here, please?

21:55.689 --> 21:57.441
I want to show you something,

21:57.650 --> 22:01.951
my new act for The Gong
Show, I've been practicing.

22:02.154 --> 22:05.249
To start with, I
come out dressed like

22:05.449 --> 22:07.872
a budding ginkgo tree!

22:10.204 --> 22:12.206
And then I say to Milton,

22:12.414 --> 22:13.916
"Milton, if you please."

22:14.124 --> 22:16.968
And Milton plays A String
of Pearls in the key of C,

22:17.169 --> 22:18.796
and I do my coyote.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.004
Your what?

22:20.047 --> 22:21.344
My coyote, like this!

22:26.345 --> 22:27.847
Jesus Christ, Melvin!

22:30.933 --> 22:32.856
And then, and then Milton plays

22:33.060 --> 22:36.360
the Jersey Bounce, and
I do my law marine.

22:36.564 --> 22:38.942
And then, and then...

22:46.907 --> 22:48.659
What's the matter, how's Melvin?

22:48.868 --> 22:50.108
How's Melvin, he's auditioning.

22:50.286 --> 22:52.163
You can hear it for yourself.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.874
Man has a heart attack,
and he's auditioning.

22:55.082 --> 22:56.174
Chuck, Chuck, give
it to me straight.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.843
How do you like my new stuff?

23:01.130 --> 23:02.130
Chuck Barrie?

23:02.172 --> 23:03.172
Where did you come from?

23:03.340 --> 23:04.683
Well, originally from Utah,

23:04.884 --> 23:07.044
but I've been in Los Angeles
now for the last 27 years.

23:07.177 --> 23:09.271
My name is Dr. Jerry Queasley,

23:09.471 --> 23:11.314
and I'm Mr. Presar's
personal physician.

23:11.515 --> 23:13.643
I'd like to have a word
with you, Mr. Barrie.

23:13.851 --> 23:14.977
Certainly.

23:15.185 --> 23:16.562
This way, please.

23:18.606 --> 23:20.449
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,

23:20.649 --> 23:22.009
can we have a little
quiet, please?

23:22.192 --> 23:24.945
Now, listen, I know
you're a very busy man,

23:25.154 --> 23:26.246
but this won't take
very much time.

23:26.447 --> 23:27.699
It's about Presar.

23:27.907 --> 23:30.080
Now, all of us have
seen Presar's act.

23:30.284 --> 23:32.958
None of us feel it is
anywhere as good as mine.

23:33.162 --> 23:33.958
That's right.

23:34.163 --> 23:35.415
Jerry's act is 10 times better.

23:35.623 --> 23:37.216
It's great, the greatest.

23:37.416 --> 23:40.260
Now, I am all set up, it'll
take a second to show you.

23:40.461 --> 23:41.883
Now.

23:44.048 --> 23:46.676
I go back, I call myself,

23:46.884 --> 23:49.808
I call my act, "Dr.
Jerry, the Singing Chef."

23:50.012 --> 23:52.356
I bring the table
out onto the stage.

23:52.556 --> 23:55.856
I tell the orchestra to begin,
they play Camptown Races,

23:56.060 --> 23:57.562
and I sing.

23:57.770 --> 24:00.614
Dr. Crawford, if you please.

24:03.651 --> 24:08.031
♪ First you break
your eggies in a dish

24:08.238 --> 24:11.868
♪ Doo-da, doo-da

24:12.076 --> 24:15.376
♪ Then you give
it a little swish

24:15.579 --> 24:19.049
♪ All the doo-da day

24:19.249 --> 24:22.503
♪ Then you add some flour

24:22.711 --> 24:26.807
♪ And a dash of spice

24:27.007 --> 24:28.930
Then you interrupt,
you come out on stage,

24:29.134 --> 24:30.977
and you say, "I'm sorry, Doc,
but we've run out of time

24:31.178 --> 24:32.498
"on the old Gong
Show," and I say,

24:32.638 --> 24:34.038
"Well, wait a minute,
wait a minute,

24:34.223 --> 24:36.021
"I can't come back
another time, I mean,

24:36.225 --> 24:38.398
"I came down from San
Francisco to do this show.

24:38.602 --> 24:39.882
"I mean, I brought all my stuff,

24:40.020 --> 24:41.647
"and now you say I gotta
come back another time?"

24:41.855 --> 24:44.233
And then you say, "Well,
I'm really sorry, Doc."

24:44.441 --> 24:46.081
You see, and then we
argue back and forth,

24:46.193 --> 24:47.911
and then I get
angrier and angrier,

24:48.112 --> 24:49.989
and I get real fed up,
and pick up the batter,

24:50.197 --> 24:51.790
and I throw it
right in your face.

24:55.119 --> 24:56.837
How do you like the act?

24:57.037 --> 24:59.756
It's just awful,
you're just a mess.

24:59.999 --> 25:00.999
My God.

25:01.083 --> 25:02.960
Is that, that's Presar!

25:03.168 --> 25:04.841
Hold it, I've got a minute.

25:05.045 --> 25:07.013
Hey, I've got it, I do, I do,

25:07.214 --> 25:08.716
I do a crow.

25:08.924 --> 25:10.892
I do a crow of The Stars
and Stripes Forever.

25:28.986 --> 25:30.283
Who needs this?

25:30.487 --> 25:32.034
Get off that damn show before

25:32.239 --> 25:33.582
you really get
bent out of shape.

25:33.782 --> 25:34.829
Get off?

25:35.034 --> 25:36.251
How am I going to get off?

25:36.452 --> 25:38.875
There are ways,
if you wanted to.

25:39.079 --> 25:41.332
You could get a substitute.

25:41.582 --> 25:43.425
Jamie Farr could do it.

25:43.625 --> 25:44.922
Willie Bobo.

25:45.127 --> 25:46.800
Joe Namath.

25:47.004 --> 25:49.302
Joe Namath, where are you
going to find Joe Namath?

25:49.506 --> 25:50.883
Someone else could do it.

25:51.091 --> 25:52.968
You know, I can't believe
this is happening.

25:55.888 --> 25:58.858
Listen, it's not
easy to get out.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.230
You know, Bo,
you're not getting out

26:00.434 --> 26:02.402
because you don't
want to get out.

26:02.603 --> 26:04.105
You like it, everything,

26:04.313 --> 26:06.987
including getting that
crap thrown in your face.

26:07.191 --> 26:09.239
Ah, come on, it's better
than working in a bank.

26:11.070 --> 26:13.072
Hey, don't change on me, Bo.

26:13.280 --> 26:14.623
What'd you say?

26:16.075 --> 26:17.418
Nothing.

26:17.618 --> 26:19.746
It's just, you have this sort
of special quality about you,

26:19.953 --> 26:21.233
and I don't want you to lose it.

26:21.371 --> 26:23.465
What quality?

26:24.875 --> 26:26.718
Never mind, forget it.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.171
Listen, why don't
you call the Cowboys

26:28.378 --> 26:29.498
tonight and play some music?

26:29.588 --> 26:31.056
That always makes you feel good.

26:33.217 --> 26:35.595
You know something, Red-Head?

26:35.803 --> 26:38.022
Presar, doing a coyote

26:38.222 --> 26:40.816
to the Jersey Bounce
really was pretty good.

26:41.016 --> 26:42.359
Oh, God, you're sick.

26:42.559 --> 26:43.606
I'm not sick.

26:43.811 --> 26:45.051
What, just 'cause I roll around

26:45.104 --> 26:47.064
with all this crap on my
face, you think I'm sick?

26:47.231 --> 26:50.075
Hey, Chuck, anybody
hear how Melvin Presar is?

26:50.275 --> 26:51.572
Yeah, I know how he is.

26:51.777 --> 26:53.404
Red and I went to the
hospital to see him today.

26:53.612 --> 26:54.704
He's okay.

26:54.905 --> 26:56.282
I don't think he's very sick.

26:56.490 --> 26:58.208
He auditioned a new act for me.

26:58.408 --> 26:59.534
He auditioned?

26:59.743 --> 27:01.837
He auditioned, and
so did his doctor.

27:02.037 --> 27:03.209
I'm not kidding.

27:03.413 --> 27:06.257
Come on, I've got a lot of
stuff to get out of my system.

29:39.361 --> 29:40.954
I ain't got no problem,

29:41.154 --> 29:42.154
You die now.

29:42.239 --> 29:43.456
Well, why?

29:43.657 --> 29:44.874
Because we're brothers.

29:45.075 --> 29:47.794
Well, what's that,

29:47.995 --> 29:49.435
why do I die because
you're brothers?

29:49.538 --> 29:51.258
Because we're brothers
from the same mother.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.418
Yeah, there was a real
end-lick in our family.

29:53.625 --> 29:54.717
A what?

29:54.918 --> 29:56.795
An end-lick, a catastrophe.

29:57.004 --> 29:59.598
When you gonged our
mother on your Gong Show,

29:59.798 --> 30:00.970
you crushed her spirit.

30:01.174 --> 30:02.721
You devastated her.

30:02.926 --> 30:04.098
Oh, wait a second.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.351
I didn't gong your mother.

30:06.555 --> 30:08.523
The judges gonged your mother.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.234
I loved your mother.

30:11.435 --> 30:12.903
Who is your mother?

30:13.103 --> 30:14.525
Dora Romani.

30:14.730 --> 30:17.028
Dora Romani?

30:17.232 --> 30:19.155
Cute, adorable Dora.

30:19.359 --> 30:21.361
I loved her singing.

30:21.570 --> 30:23.868
I wouldn't have gonged Dora
if I could have gonged Dora.

30:24.072 --> 30:25.540
Shut up, no more talking.

to bullshit your way

30:29.077 --> 30:31.125
Mario, pick up the top
of the garbage can.

30:31.330 --> 30:32.377
Right.

30:32.581 --> 30:33.878
What for?

30:34.041 --> 30:35.839
What for, because it's dramatic,

30:36.043 --> 30:38.296
and Bare-Ass here is show biz,

30:38.503 --> 30:41.473
so I just figure we give him
a little show biz goodbye.

30:41.673 --> 30:44.142
Go hit the top of the
garbage can, Mario.

30:44.343 --> 30:47.813
And here's the moment
we've all been waiting for.

30:48.013 --> 30:50.436
You hit the top of
the garbage pail,

30:50.640 --> 30:52.313
it's like you hit the gong,

30:52.517 --> 30:54.770
I hit the trigger,
and he hits the deck.

30:54.978 --> 30:57.731
Vito, that's great,
that's greatness, Vito.

30:57.939 --> 30:58.939

Hey, wait a minute,

31:00.901 --> 31:02.073

31:02.277 --> 31:04.496

31:19.920 --> 31:21.968

do that little thing

31:22.172 --> 31:23.212
we did at Angie's wedding.

31:23.256 --> 31:26.100
What thing was that? I forget.

31:26.301 --> 31:28.554
That's where we sang
the Robert E. Lee,

31:28.762 --> 31:30.309
and then, in the
middle of the song,

31:30.514 --> 31:31.891
we tell a little joke, and then

31:32.099 --> 31:33.976
we sing the end of
the Robert E. Lee.

31:35.477 --> 31:36.979
What joke was that?

31:37.187 --> 31:39.189
That's the joke where I say,

"What do you call 250 Indian
maidens without nipples?"

31:43.276 --> 31:44.698

Hey, we'll be back.

37:08.435 --> 37:09.561
What, what?

37:09.769 --> 37:10.895
What, what?

37:11.104 --> 37:12.447
Oh, yeah, but not now,

37:12.647 --> 37:14.024
Moon, I gotta do commercial,
right after the commercial.

37:14.232 --> 37:15.232
Hey, Chuck, Chuckie.

37:15.316 --> 37:16.033
We'll be back.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.234
What?

37:17.277 --> 37:18.997
Is it okay if I just
kind of stand out here?

37:19.028 --> 37:19.870
All right, now, just
stand right there, Moon.

37:20.071 --> 37:21.789
Just let me get in
the commercial, okay?

37:21.990 --> 37:23.492
All right, we'll be right back.

37:23.700 --> 37:24.997
We'll be right back.

37:26.870 --> 37:28.964
Chuckie, would
you do me a favor?

37:29.164 --> 37:31.087
Could you tell me
if my fly is open?

37:32.709 --> 37:34.177
Oh, no, it's not, it's closed.

37:34.377 --> 37:35.845
Well, it should be, I'm peeing.

37:51.519 --> 37:53.692
Now we've gone over the edge.

37:53.897 --> 37:56.867
Right out of their
flipping minds.

38:00.612 --> 38:03.741
Five shows are too
much to do in one night.

38:03.948 --> 38:05.068
Well, we can't tape any less

38:05.241 --> 38:06.538
if we want to make our schedule.

38:06.743 --> 38:09.371
Schedule, schmedule,
there may not even be one.

38:09.579 --> 38:11.001
Charles, you're in big trouble.

38:11.206 --> 38:13.675
Stations are canceling the
show left, right, and center.

38:13.875 --> 38:14.967
What show?

38:15.168 --> 38:16.841
This show, your
show, The Gong Show.

38:17.045 --> 38:18.765
Oh, they don't care how
big the ratings are.

38:18.880 --> 38:20.598
You're offending
too many viewers,

38:20.799 --> 38:23.769
and your offensiveness,
Charles, is escalating.

38:23.968 --> 38:25.720
Now, Charles, we could be up,

38:25.929 --> 38:28.102
pardon the expression,
Crap's Creek.

38:28.306 --> 38:29.603
No.

38:29.808 --> 38:32.106
I know you're on the run,
but we must have dinner

38:32.310 --> 38:34.028
to discuss this
before it's too late.

38:34.229 --> 38:36.982
Mabel, please make a reservation

38:37.190 --> 38:39.943
at Matteo's tonight
for three at 8:30.

38:40.151 --> 38:41.869
Good, good.

38:44.489 --> 38:45.581
What a clay.

38:45.782 --> 38:46.829
Yeah.

38:47.033 --> 38:49.377
I'm telling you, Bo,
you really gotta get away.

38:49.577 --> 38:51.204
You ain't just
bumping your gums.

38:54.833 --> 38:57.712
Hey, how about a month
on the French Riviera?

38:57.919 --> 38:59.091
Yeah, sure.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.557
Ah, good evening,
Monsieur Barrie.

39:02.757 --> 39:04.350
Greetings, mademoiselle.

39:04.551 --> 39:05.803
How are you, Raoul?

39:06.010 --> 39:07.933
This way, please,
careful, careful.

39:08.137 --> 39:09.559
Careful with that, careful.

39:09.764 --> 39:11.437
Table for two, this one.

39:11.641 --> 39:13.564
May I, merci beaucoup.

39:13.768 --> 39:15.236
May I take your jacket, please?

39:16.479 --> 39:18.982
Always the epitome of
style, of style, class.

39:19.190 --> 39:22.034
Que elegance,
please, lovely Red.

39:22.235 --> 39:23.361
Oh, pardon, monsieur.

39:23.570 --> 39:25.447
You look kind of tired
this evening, Charles.

39:25.655 --> 39:26.998
Always tired, Raoul.

39:27.198 --> 39:28.495
Well, let me tell you,
your secretary called.

39:28.700 --> 39:30.668
You're a private party, no
one will bother you back here,

39:30.869 --> 39:32.389
a little private
party, wonderful lace.

39:32.453 --> 39:33.921
Far from the maddening crowd!

39:34.122 --> 39:36.045
I've also chilled the Perrier.

39:36.249 --> 39:37.546
You know, this
one I love myself.

39:37.750 --> 39:39.593
Let me see, now, I will now
get the menus, tout suite.

39:39.794 --> 39:41.046
The menus, please.

39:42.297 --> 39:44.297
Pardon me, Chuck, but I'd
like to introduce myself.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.009
I'm the cook, I
know you're busy,

39:46.217 --> 39:48.060
but I just wanted you to
hear something I wrote

39:48.261 --> 39:50.261
that you might want to use
on your television show.

39:52.307 --> 39:55.060
Dr. Crawford, if you please.

39:57.437 --> 39:58.689
♪ I'm a cook, I'm a cook

Out, you're doing exactly

40:25.089 --> 40:26.716
what Mr. Barrie is trying
desperately to avoid.

40:26.925 --> 40:28.097
I don't believe you did this.

40:28.301 --> 40:29.901
I beg your pardon, I
can't get good help.

40:30.053 --> 40:31.805
I didn't plan this,
I'm so embarrassed.

40:32.013 --> 40:32.809
Pardon, pardon.

40:33.014 --> 40:35.563
I'm so nervous, I'm
going to smack his face,

40:35.767 --> 40:36.893
I'm so sorry.

40:37.101 --> 40:38.819
I will attempt now to
get the menus again.

40:39.020 --> 40:40.897
The menus!

40:42.148 --> 40:44.446
Anyway, as I was saying outside,

40:44.651 --> 40:46.949
you need to get
away, you really do.

40:47.153 --> 40:49.326
You've gotta get
back to the basics.

40:49.530 --> 40:52.909
Smell the flowers, think
about life, stuff like that.

40:53.117 --> 40:55.711
You've been working on that
looney bin show for so long,

40:55.912 --> 40:58.085
it's driving you crazy,
and you don't even know it.

40:58.289 --> 41:00.212
You've seen over a zillion acts,

41:00.416 --> 41:02.339
and with auditions
and rehearsals,

41:02.543 --> 41:06.013
week in and week out, you're
just not having fun anymore.

41:06.214 --> 41:09.468
It's like you say, if it
ain't fun, don't do it.

41:09.676 --> 41:11.929
And it ain't fun,
so don't do it.

41:12.136 --> 41:13.809
Well, what do you want me to do?

41:14.013 --> 41:16.141
I don't know, anything.

41:16.349 --> 41:17.817
Go home and play with yourself.

41:18.017 --> 41:19.769
Just get off that
goddamn Gong Show.

41:19.978 --> 41:21.855
Play with yourself
on The Gong Show?

41:22.063 --> 41:23.360
Is that what you plan to do,

41:23.564 --> 41:25.066
play with yourself on
coast-to-coast television?

41:25.274 --> 41:27.402
Oh, I knew it, I knew it.

41:27.610 --> 41:29.078
Sorry, kids, I'm late,

41:29.278 --> 41:32.157
but I had to drop Mildred
at her sumo wrestling class.

41:34.450 --> 41:36.498
Coming up, a
chair for Mr. Dildo.

41:36.703 --> 41:38.250
Oh, Didlo, Didlo.

41:38.454 --> 41:39.000
Didlo.

41:39.205 --> 41:40.582
Did-id-id-IO-IO-IO.

41:40.790 --> 41:41.791
I beg your pardon.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.173
Monsieur Barrie,
Mademoiselle, Mr. Didlo,

41:45.503 --> 41:47.130
we have no menus.

41:47.338 --> 41:49.181
I mean this is no,
we have no menus.

41:49.382 --> 41:50.742
I mean, we keep
getting ripped off,

41:50.842 --> 41:51.968
there aren't any.

41:52.176 --> 41:54.599
Let's just not discuss the
menus any further, shall we?

41:54.804 --> 41:56.647
And I'll be okay,
no, it's nothing.

41:56.848 --> 41:58.270
Decide what you want to eat,

41:58.474 --> 41:59.896
and I'll see if we can
fix it for you, okay?

42:00.101 --> 42:02.024
Just take your time, I'll be
back in an hour and a half,

42:02.228 --> 42:03.821
and you just try to relax.

42:04.022 --> 42:05.114
Goodness sake, one
of us should relax.

42:05.314 --> 42:06.861
Where are the menus, please?

42:07.066 --> 42:09.034
Well, I'm not hungry, thank God.

42:10.319 --> 42:11.866
What's up, Buddy?

42:12.071 --> 42:13.071
You look worried.

42:13.114 --> 42:16.118
Right, I will get
straight to the point.

42:16.325 --> 42:19.124
Now, as a representative
of the network,

42:19.328 --> 42:21.501
I'm responsible for taste,

42:21.706 --> 42:24.004
religion, politics, and money.

42:24.208 --> 42:26.552
Your responsibility
is to the people.

42:26.711 --> 42:28.839
Now, millions of viewers
are counting on you

42:29.047 --> 42:30.139
to get them through
the week, now,

42:30.339 --> 42:31.966
that's a big responsibility.

42:33.259 --> 42:35.227
And, Charles, quite
frankly, you are,

42:35.428 --> 42:38.227
pardon the expression,
buggering it up.

42:38.431 --> 42:40.980
Now, I wouldn't tell you this

42:41.184 --> 42:42.481
unless I loved you.

42:42.685 --> 42:44.403
A piece of you is
a piece of me, and,

42:44.604 --> 42:46.527
and, where are you going?

42:47.940 --> 42:49.317
I'm going to pissy.

42:49.525 --> 42:50.902
Do what?

42:51.110 --> 42:53.329
He's going to drain the goose.

42:55.281 --> 42:56.999
Chuck, Chuck
Barrie, how are you?

42:57.200 --> 42:58.497
Once upon a time, Charles,

42:58.701 --> 43:00.874
The Gong Show was a
symphony of entertainment,

43:01.079 --> 43:03.753
but now The Gong Show
is The Goon Show.

43:03.956 --> 43:05.708
Cheap jokes, filthy language,

43:07.043 --> 43:10.638
Jaye P. exposing
herself, transvestites.

43:10.838 --> 43:12.055
Cute transvestites,
you gotta admit,

43:12.256 --> 43:13.428
they're cute transvestites.

43:13.633 --> 43:15.033
Yeah, yeah,
adolescent girls giving,

43:15.176 --> 43:16.553
pardon the expression,
head to popsicles.

43:16.761 --> 43:18.855
Now, in the beginning,
Charles, I believed in you.

43:19.055 --> 43:22.605
I believed in you, I still
do, but the cancellations, oh!

43:22.809 --> 43:25.938
Chicago, Detroit,
even San Diego.

43:26.145 --> 43:27.237
San Diego?

43:27.438 --> 43:28.906
Now, the bottom line is:

43:29.107 --> 43:31.280
you and The Gong Show shape up

43:31.484 --> 43:33.111
or you both ship out.

43:33.319 --> 43:34.616
I'll shape up.

43:34.821 --> 43:36.073
Do I have your word on it?

43:36.280 --> 43:39.705
I'd raise my right hand, but
I'm a little busy right now.

43:39.909 --> 43:40.910
Then repeat after me:

43:41.119 --> 43:44.919
I, Chuck Barrie,
do solemnly swear...

43:45.123 --> 43:46.123
Chuck Barrie!

43:46.207 --> 43:48.710
Are you Chuck Barrie?

43:48.918 --> 43:50.795
The guy on The Gong Show?

44:09.147 --> 44:11.445
Come on, honey,
it's time to get up.

44:11.649 --> 44:14.949
I know it's early, but
you got a long day today.

44:15.153 --> 44:18.999
Come on, sleepyhead, come
on, that's a good boy.

44:19.198 --> 44:21.701
Plump your pillows
up like you like,

44:21.909 --> 44:23.001
make it nice and cozy.

44:23.202 --> 44:24.249
Here's your little
hat, I know you

44:24.453 --> 44:26.046
like your little
hat in the morning.

44:26.247 --> 44:28.249
Now, I have a surprise for
you, so close your eyes.

44:28.457 --> 44:29.457
They never opened up.

44:29.625 --> 44:30.625
Are they closed?

44:30.793 --> 44:31.885
Yeah.

44:34.172 --> 44:35.845
Breakfast in bed!

44:36.966 --> 44:40.140
I haven't made you breakfast
in bed since the good 0l' days.

44:40.344 --> 44:42.517
Bacon and eggs.

44:42.722 --> 44:44.190
Give me a little kiss.

44:47.977 --> 44:49.570
Oh, no.

44:49.729 --> 44:51.072
What?

44:51.272 --> 44:52.774
Didlo!

44:54.025 --> 44:55.242
I can't believe it.

44:58.196 --> 45:01.120
My God, are you folks deaf?

45:01.324 --> 45:03.668
I've been ringing
your doorbell forever.

45:05.161 --> 45:07.459
Uh huh, you probably
turn it off,

45:07.663 --> 45:08.960
like you turn your phones off.

45:09.165 --> 45:11.634
Wanted a little,
pardon the expression,

45:11.834 --> 45:13.586
early morning diddle, eh?

45:13.794 --> 45:16.798
Oh, I'm exhausted, I didn't
sleep a wink last night.

45:17.006 --> 45:19.350
And it's all because of you.

45:19.550 --> 45:21.268
You're determined
to drive me crazy,

45:21.469 --> 45:23.142
but I'm not going
to let you do it.

45:23.346 --> 45:26.850
No, siree, I am not
going to let it happen.

45:27.058 --> 45:28.401
I'm not going to let it happen.

45:28.601 --> 45:32.071
Oh, that looks scrumptious.

45:33.314 --> 45:34.987
I need marmalade, Red.

45:35.191 --> 45:37.785
Oh, and skim milk, dear,

45:37.985 --> 45:39.828
I never use cream.

45:40.029 --> 45:41.906
And neither should Charles.

45:42.114 --> 45:43.866
Buddy, what are you doing?

45:45.034 --> 45:46.035
I'm eating Charles' breakfast,

45:46.244 --> 45:47.791
Can't you see what I'm doing?

45:47.995 --> 45:49.918
Now, Charles,

45:50.122 --> 45:53.126
we parted last night without
you signing this agreement,

45:53.334 --> 45:55.257
promising that you
would behave yourself,

45:55.461 --> 45:57.134
and Jaye too, and
that The Gong Show

45:57.338 --> 46:00.091
would be a good show.

46:00.299 --> 46:01.972
Now, sign it this minute.

46:02.927 --> 46:04.929
Go on, sign it, I said, sign it.

46:05.137 --> 46:07.731
Hey, Buddy, it's <i>7</i>
o'clock in the morning.

46:07.932 --> 46:08.932
So what?

46:09.016 --> 46:11.189
This is for your protection.

46:12.561 --> 46:14.939
That's why I've been
climbing vines and trees

46:15.147 --> 46:17.320
at dawn, to protect you.

46:17.525 --> 46:19.994
That's what friends
are for, Charles.

46:20.194 --> 46:23.494
And you know I care about
you, and the Red one.

46:23.698 --> 46:26.042
Oh, seriously?

46:26.242 --> 46:27.289
Seriously what?

46:27.493 --> 46:28.836
I mean, you really care?

46:29.036 --> 46:30.583
I really care.

46:30.788 --> 46:34.088
In fact, I, and pardon the
expression, I love you both,

46:34.292 --> 46:35.384
in my WaY-

46:35.584 --> 46:36.961
Hear that, Red?

46:37.169 --> 46:38.591
He likes us.

46:40.006 --> 46:42.100
You know, it's nice to
wake up in the morning

46:42.300 --> 46:45.179
with somebody you really
like right next to you.

46:45.386 --> 46:47.559
I wonder how many people
in the city right now

46:47.763 --> 46:50.562
are waking up to someone they
really like next to them.

46:50.766 --> 46:52.985
Not many, I can tell ya.

46:53.185 --> 46:55.904
Maybe just a handful.

48:36.997 --> 48:38.920
Go on, sign it I said, sign it.

48:39.125 --> 48:40.547
I guess you wonder why I called

48:40.751 --> 48:42.344
this little meeting
here this morning.

48:42.545 --> 48:45.139
Well, let me get to
the point: it's Didlo.

48:45.339 --> 48:48.639
I mean, he is, he
has been hollering

48:48.843 --> 48:51.016
and yelling at
me, day and night,

48:51.220 --> 48:54.394
and he says that, I don't know,

48:54.598 --> 48:56.817
that you and I are just too, uh,

48:57.017 --> 48:58.894
too wild and woolly.

48:59.103 --> 49:00.355
Wild and woolly?

49:00.563 --> 49:02.406
Well, not exactly
wild and woolly, he says,

49:02.606 --> 49:04.950
I guess that we're too crazy.

49:05.151 --> 49:06.151
Crazy?

49:06.193 --> 49:07.193
Oh, come on, Jaye,

49:07.361 --> 49:09.910
we're too dirty,
that's what it is,

49:10.114 --> 49:10.785
we're just too dirty.

49:10.990 --> 49:12.116
We're really too dirty?

49:12.324 --> 49:14.372
Gee, I thought I was
being pretty good.

49:14.577 --> 49:16.079
Being pretty good?

49:16.287 --> 49:19.837
I mean, you're saying
to that priest,

49:20.040 --> 49:22.384
"Hey, father, you
were really a mother."

49:22.543 --> 49:25.638
Or to that bird lady,
"There may be a pigeon

49:25.838 --> 49:26.930
"on your shoulder,
honey, but under

49:27.131 --> 49:29.054
"that skirt of yours,
there's a beaver."

49:29.258 --> 49:30.805
I mean, that's being good?

49:31.010 --> 49:32.933
Come on, Jaye, it's not funny.

49:33.137 --> 49:35.936
I mean, it's funny,
but it's not funny.

49:36.140 --> 49:39.440
Okay, I won't
talk dirty anymore.

49:39.643 --> 49:40.690
You promise?

49:40.895 --> 49:43.068
Do you promise you
will not be dirty?

49:43.272 --> 49:45.024
Cross my fucking heart.

49:46.066 --> 49:47.693
Why are you so
late this morning?

49:47.902 --> 49:49.119
I overslept.

49:50.362 --> 49:51.909
You always oversleep.

49:52.114 --> 49:54.492
Why did you have to write that
letter to your sister now?

49:54.700 --> 49:56.953
The acts have been waiting
over an hour as it is.

49:59.121 --> 50:00.961
You haven't changed your
clothes in three days,

50:01.123 --> 50:02.170
you look awful.

50:02.374 --> 50:04.797
Coming in late,
and walking around

50:05.002 --> 50:06.470
with about as much energy as

50:06.670 --> 50:08.764
a hippopotamus with a hernia.

50:08.964 --> 50:11.092
You've got to get
more rest, honey.

50:11.300 --> 50:12.643
Ain't that right, mama?

50:12.843 --> 50:13.560
That's right.

50:13.761 --> 50:15.980
Hey, Mabel, come here, baby.

50:16.180 --> 50:18.274
Come here, I just want
to ask you something.

50:18.474 --> 50:20.818
I've been meaning to
ask you this for years.

50:21.018 --> 50:24.272
How come your mother
follows you wherever you go?

50:24.480 --> 50:26.482
Well, I keep telling
her to go home,

50:26.690 --> 50:28.317
but she don't know
where she lives.

50:28.526 --> 50:30.403
She don't know where she lives?

50:32.029 --> 50:34.578
You don't know where you live?

50:34.782 --> 50:36.250
That's right.

50:43.916 --> 50:46.510
I can handle it from
here, girls, okay?

50:57.304 --> 50:58.897
Remember, that's where you stop.

50:59.098 --> 51:01.521
OkaYl now, if you get
Qoflged, you're not

51:01.725 --> 51:03.602
going to get all crazy
about that, are you?

51:04.937 --> 51:06.189
I mean, like you
said, quote the words

51:06.397 --> 51:08.820
of that great old sage,
that's life in the city.

51:09.024 --> 51:11.903
You know, all right?

51:12.111 --> 51:14.580
You and me, we're doing
it for a laugh, all right?

51:14.780 --> 51:15.952
I mean, you know, whatever.

51:16.156 --> 51:17.499
Whatever happens.

51:17.700 --> 51:18.980
I mean, don't take
it personally,

51:19.076 --> 51:21.316
because they gong some of the
finest people on that show.

51:21.453 --> 51:22.493
See you later, Mr. Barrie.

51:22.621 --> 51:23.918
BYE, Mike, you too.

51:24.081 --> 51:25.628
You too, thanks for coming down.

51:27.167 --> 51:28.965
Thank you, take the
book, don't forget.

51:29.169 --> 51:31.171
Jenny, we have done more

51:31.380 --> 51:34.680
than a manager does in a
year, we do in a week, here.

51:38.637 --> 51:40.264
While she's talking, yeah,

51:40.472 --> 51:41.894
absolutely, absolutely.

51:43.183 --> 51:44.981
Hush up, Harry, hush up.

51:46.020 --> 51:48.899
We'll tell you when
to start, all right?

51:49.106 --> 51:50.278
Because I got Harry
Christian in the nose.

51:50.482 --> 51:52.442
Fuck it, so I'll make it
to the first of the year.

51:54.069 --> 51:56.822
Barely, to the first
of the goddamn year.

51:57.031 --> 51:58.351
Where the hell is
my black pencil?

51:58.407 --> 52:01.126
My name is Walter Wanderman.

52:01.327 --> 52:03.876
Now, listen to it, Chuck,
it's a very euphonious name.

52:04.079 --> 52:06.252
Walter, Wanderman.

52:06.498 --> 52:09.422
Da-da, da-da-da.

52:09.627 --> 52:12.130
I've done many Broadway
shows in Paris,

52:12.338 --> 52:14.932
a lot of television commercials,
a lot of television,

52:15.132 --> 52:17.931
television series,
and a couple of, eh,

52:18.135 --> 52:20.354
films that are being shown
in mental institutions.

52:20.554 --> 52:23.353
Oh, you see, Chuck,
everything in my whole career

52:23.557 --> 52:24.900
has always been in a comic vein.

52:25.100 --> 52:27.523
I mean, I like
comedy, I love comedy.

52:27.728 --> 52:31.232
Hey, man, I'm a funny
man, duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.

52:31.440 --> 52:33.613
But you see, you see,
Chuck, the thing is,

52:33.817 --> 52:36.098
the thing is, I've always
gotten up and done my own stuff.

52:36.153 --> 52:37.370
I mean, I've never gotten up

52:37.571 --> 52:38.931
and done another
writer's material.

52:39.073 --> 52:40.273
And here I am in front of you,

52:40.407 --> 52:44.037
and I'm doing myself,
me, da-da-da-da-da.

52:44.244 --> 52:45.917
Chuck, Chuck, Chuck, Chuck.

52:46.121 --> 52:47.964
Chuck, Chuck, Chuck,

52:48.207 --> 52:49.129
I want to ask you a question.

52:49.333 --> 52:50.334
I'll disappear.

52:50.542 --> 52:52.670
Me, I'm doing acting, Chuck,

52:52.878 --> 52:53.879
I'd like to ask you a question.

52:54.088 --> 52:55.931
Did you, did you ever
try doing yourself?

52:56.131 --> 52:57.883
Oh, no.

52:58.092 --> 53:00.845
Well, anyway, Chuck, come on,
what are you walking out on me for?

53:01.053 --> 53:02.053
No, you're playing.

53:02.096 --> 53:03.348
Don't you have respect
for actors here?

53:03.555 --> 53:04.898
I do, I do.

53:05.099 --> 53:06.939
So what are you leaving
for, I'm an actor, man.

53:07.101 --> 53:08.101
What is this shit?

53:08.227 --> 53:09.820
<i>Hey! chuck!</i>

53:10.020 --> 53:11.442
Hey, Chuckie, come on!

53:11.647 --> 53:12.773
I'll be right back.

53:12.981 --> 53:13.823
He'll be right back,
I've been waiting here

53:14.024 --> 53:15.867
for three hours, here,
man, since Saturday.

53:16.068 --> 53:17.820
Hey, Chuck, come on!

53:18.028 --> 53:19.530
Hey!

53:19.738 --> 53:22.662
I don't believe this, I
don't believe this, man.

53:22.866 --> 53:24.994
I came here, where is that man?

53:25.202 --> 53:27.421
I'm not going to,
I'm going to wait.

53:29.039 --> 53:31.041
I gotta get out
of this business.

53:31.250 --> 53:32.251
Hi, Daddy.

53:32.459 --> 53:33.802
Hi, Della, what's up?

53:34.002 --> 53:35.970
Remember I told you I want
to come by and surprise you?

53:36.171 --> 53:36.842
Yeah.

53:37.047 --> 53:37.889
Well, I'm getting married.

53:38.090 --> 53:39.342
You're getting married?

53:39.550 --> 53:41.018
You're 16 years old.

53:41.218 --> 53:43.095
I'm in love, Daddy,
and I'm getting married.

53:43.303 --> 53:45.143
You know, when you're in
love in a certain way,

53:45.305 --> 53:47.854
you get married, it doesn't
matter how old you are.

53:48.058 --> 53:50.982
Anyway, I want you to
meet the guy I'm marrying.

53:51.186 --> 53:53.405
Bill, come on in.

53:53.605 --> 53:55.824
This is Bill Bridges, Daddy.

53:56.024 --> 53:57.196
Bill, this is my father.

53:57.401 --> 53:59.153
Hello, Mr. Barrie,
how are you?

54:01.029 --> 54:03.703
Holy batshit, Robin.

54:05.117 --> 54:07.040
Are you ready?

54:07.244 --> 54:07.961
Yeah.

54:08.162 --> 54:11.291
Marriage, marriage,
what's marriage?

54:11.498 --> 54:13.000
Chuckie baby!

54:33.520 --> 54:35.272
You know, I'm still beat.

54:35.481 --> 54:37.609
I am still beat.

54:38.859 --> 54:40.406
Well, you played really hard.

54:40.611 --> 54:42.989
And Marinara, he ain't
exactly chopped liver.

54:43.197 --> 54:44.790
You know, that's not it.

54:44.990 --> 54:46.070
You know what it really is?

54:46.200 --> 54:47.793
I'm still angry,
that's what it is.

54:47.993 --> 54:49.620
I'm still angry at the world.

54:49.828 --> 54:51.171
And with all that raquetball,

54:51.371 --> 54:53.499
and I still didn't get
it out of my system.

54:54.875 --> 54:56.047
Wanna roll a drunk?

54:57.544 --> 54:59.012
Very funny.

54:59.213 --> 55:00.931
But I'll tell you what,

55:01.131 --> 55:03.099
I think I ought to
call Billy and Ray,

55:03.300 --> 55:05.018
and maybe, you
know, jam a little.

55:05.219 --> 55:06.219
That's a good idea.

55:06.303 --> 55:07.520
Okay, let's do that.

55:07.721 --> 55:09.394
All right, go ahead, go.

55:21.151 --> 55:24.030
All right, let's
get out a dime here.

55:25.072 --> 55:26.164
Okay.

55:29.535 --> 55:31.208
Hey, you know who that guy is?

55:31.411 --> 55:33.038
No, who?

55:33.247 --> 55:36.342
Chuck Barrie, the guy
who does The Gong Show.

55:38.126 --> 55:39.548
Watch this.

55:41.046 --> 55:42.798
I think The Gong
Shaw's the dumbest

55:43.006 --> 55:44.679
fucking show on television,

55:44.883 --> 55:46.851
and so is that
schmuck that does it.

55:52.099 --> 55:53.772
Call the Cowboys.

55:55.143 --> 55:56.440
Did you hear what he said?

55:58.021 --> 56:00.240
Just forget it and
call the Cowboys.

56:02.526 --> 56:04.119
Come on, it comes
with the territory.

56:04.319 --> 56:05.821
Comes with the territory.

56:06.029 --> 56:08.953
I'm tired of everything
coming with the territory.

56:10.868 --> 56:12.745
Honey, they're too big!

56:30.137 --> 56:31.434
All right, all right, look,

56:31.638 --> 56:33.982
I'm not on the phone now, I'm
right in front of your face.

56:34.182 --> 56:35.525
Now, talk about The Gong Show.

56:35.726 --> 56:37.524
Go ahead, big brave guy, I
don't care how big you are.

56:37.728 --> 56:39.048
Say something about
The Gong Show,

56:39.104 --> 56:40.104
now tell me, say it.

56:40.147 --> 56:40.864
Just say it.

56:41.064 --> 56:42.064
I say, rag m0P-

56:55.162 --> 56:57.836
Chuck Barrie, you get
down here this instant.

56:58.040 --> 56:59.166
That's enough.

57:00.792 --> 57:02.840
Mr. Barrie, I know
everyone asks you this,

57:03.045 --> 57:05.468
but could my husband take a picture
with you and me together?

57:05.672 --> 57:07.094
If you wanna, Mr. Barrie,

57:07.299 --> 57:09.802
your friend Rag Mop can
be in the picture, too.

57:10.010 --> 57:11.387
No pictures.

57:11.595 --> 57:14.144
Kyle, don't take anymore
pictures until I fix my hair.

57:15.474 --> 57:17.522
You and me together.

57:20.771 --> 57:23.365
You get your hand off my
roommate, you big lummox.

57:23.565 --> 57:25.943
Hey, how about one
with Chuck and his girl,

57:26.151 --> 57:27.824
and me and my wife?

57:28.028 --> 57:29.905
I said no pictures!

57:30.948 --> 57:33.167
Well, if you're going
to play grab-ass, Kyle,

57:33.367 --> 57:34.914
who's going to
take the pictures?

57:37.245 --> 57:39.623
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

57:39.831 --> 57:41.959
here's the host and
star of the show,

57:42.167 --> 57:43.760
my daddy!

57:43.919 --> 57:46.468
From Indianapolis,
Indiana, we bring you

57:46.672 --> 57:48.640
a young man who, in my opinion,

57:48.840 --> 57:50.934
is ready to give
up his regular job

57:51.134 --> 57:55.139
and in no time find steady
employment as a doorstop.

57:55.347 --> 57:59.568
♪ I'm singing in the rain

58:07.526 --> 58:09.528
Now, a jackass.

58:21.623 --> 58:24.001
I'd like to pose
a Biblical question:

58:24.209 --> 58:25.711
is there life after death?

58:25.919 --> 58:27.546
Well, father, that's
a good question.

58:27.754 --> 58:29.131
Is there life after
death, father?

58:29.339 --> 58:30.431
Well, son,

58:30.632 --> 58:32.555
does a face have
a watertight ass?

58:45.022 --> 58:47.070
Anybody want to
buy a little dog?

58:48.316 --> 58:51.445
♪ I love it here

58:51.653 --> 58:53.872
♪ I love

58:58.160 --> 58:59.628
Ladies and gentlemen,

58:59.828 --> 59:02.672
oh, come get me, come
get me, come get me.

59:02.873 --> 59:04.591
Ladies and gentlemen,
our next performer

59:04.791 --> 59:06.088
says that she likes swimming,

59:06.251 --> 59:08.674
and take me away now.

59:08.879 --> 59:09.926
I'm going crazy-

59:10.130 --> 59:11.177
Now, let me ask
you this, Scarlet.

59:11.381 --> 59:12.428
Well, what, Red?

59:12.632 --> 59:14.600
What is short and
squat and limp and hot?

59:14.801 --> 59:16.223
I don't know, Red, what is short

59:16.428 --> 59:17.805
and squat and limp and hot?

59:18.013 --> 59:19.060
My pecker, Scarlet.

59:25.562 --> 59:26.939
Take that thing up.

59:27.147 --> 59:29.241
Let's have them take that up.

59:29.441 --> 59:31.239
Up, take that up.

59:31.443 --> 59:33.036
Take this thing up.

59:33.236 --> 59:34.362
Jesus.

59:44.831 --> 59:46.833
Take this up.

59:47.042 --> 59:49.261
Take that up, already.

01:00:01.973 --> 01:00:02.974
And my friends,

01:00:03.183 --> 01:00:04.856
did she despair?

01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:07.062
Did she gnash her teeth or...

01:00:19.074 --> 01:00:21.452
Now, the moral of the story is,

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:25.130
if the road to hell is
paved with good intentions,

01:00:26.581 --> 01:00:29.004
what's the Pennsylvania
Turnpike paved with?

01:00:29.209 --> 01:00:30.711
Craplock?

01:00:30.919 --> 01:00:32.387
Craplock?

01:00:33.797 --> 01:00:35.515
Craplock!

01:00:40.053 --> 01:00:41.521
I'm a psychiatrist.

01:00:41.721 --> 01:00:43.064
I suspect that he
is on the verge

01:00:43.265 --> 01:00:44.767
of some sort of a breakdown.

01:00:44.975 --> 01:00:47.398
He must see a doctor
just as soon as possible.

01:00:47.602 --> 01:00:49.696
He said you may be
having a nervous breakdown.

01:00:49.896 --> 01:00:52.524
Right now, I want you to
go see a doctor tomorrow.

01:00:52.732 --> 01:00:53.732
No.

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:54.900
Okay, doc!

01:00:55.026 --> 01:00:57.654
Give it to me straight.

01:00:57.863 --> 01:00:59.991
Look, I've done a
complete physical on you,

01:01:00.198 --> 01:01:01.958
and the only thing I
can find wrong with you,

01:01:02.117 --> 01:01:03.869
other than a
distorted imagination,

01:01:04.077 --> 01:01:06.500
is that you are exhausted.

01:01:07.581 --> 01:01:09.549
And you seem pretty
worried about something.

01:01:10.709 --> 01:01:11.881
You know, Betsy,

01:01:12.085 --> 01:01:13.086
I think

01:01:13.295 --> 01:01:15.844
I just don't like to do
The Gong Show anymore.

01:01:16.047 --> 01:01:17.219
In fact,

01:01:17.424 --> 01:01:19.847
I think I hate
doing The Gong Show.

01:01:20.051 --> 01:01:21.223
How come?

01:01:21.428 --> 01:01:22.896
I guess because

01:01:23.096 --> 01:01:24.136
everybody thinks of me now

01:01:24.306 --> 01:01:25.853
as some kind of a
clown, you know,

01:01:26.057 --> 01:01:27.809
buffoon,

01:01:29.144 --> 01:01:32.193
an idiot jumping around
the stage like a damn fool.

01:01:32.397 --> 01:01:35.025
I'd just like to do
something meaningful.

01:01:36.026 --> 01:01:37.949
Listen to me, Chuck.

01:01:38.153 --> 01:01:39.826
It's important
that you get away,

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:43.159
even if it's just
for a few days, but,

01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:45.869
if you can, try and
stay a few months.

01:01:46.077 --> 01:01:48.250
I can't believe that Betsy,

01:01:48.455 --> 01:01:50.082
I can't believe what
she says, you know?

01:01:50.290 --> 01:01:53.464
But she's absolutely
right, you should go away.

01:01:53.627 --> 01:01:56.597
Screw the shows, all they
do is give you asthma.

01:01:56.796 --> 01:01:59.140
You know something, you
got your hand on my canipe?

01:01:59.341 --> 01:02:01.560
- What?
- That's my canipe.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.854
Honey, that's not a
canipe, that's a love handle.

01:02:04.054 --> 01:02:06.807
You call it a love
handle, I call it a canipe.

01:02:07.015 --> 01:02:08.892
Oh, come on, Bo, don't
change the subject.

01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:10.100
What's the...

01:02:10.143 --> 01:02:11.223
My asthma's better, listen.

01:02:12.896 --> 01:02:14.022
Yeah, it sounds real good.

01:02:14.231 --> 01:02:15.528
- It is.
- Listen, Betsy's right.

01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:17.052
If you don't go
away, you're going

01:02:17.108 --> 01:02:18.576
to have a breakdown for sure,

01:02:18.777 --> 01:02:20.825
and spend the rest of your
life on a shrink's couch.

01:02:21.029 --> 01:02:23.202
Fat chance that I'm going
to be on a shrink's couch.

01:02:23.406 --> 01:02:26.410
Speaking of shrinks, this
guy goes to the shrink,

01:02:26.618 --> 01:02:28.040
and he says, "Doctor," he says,

01:02:28.245 --> 01:02:30.247
"I've got this
really weird problem.

01:02:30.455 --> 01:02:31.798
"I've got this feeling
that there's this

01:02:31.998 --> 01:02:34.171
"screw in my belly button
and there's nothing

01:02:34.376 --> 01:02:36.219
I can do about it,
it's just there."

01:02:36.419 --> 01:02:38.592
So, the psychiatrist says,
"Don't worry about it."

01:02:38.797 --> 01:02:40.237
He says, "Look, tell
you what you do,

01:02:40.298 --> 01:02:41.595
"you go home tonight, see,

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:42.892
"and when you get home,

01:02:43.093 --> 01:02:45.596
"get out your tool chest
and go in your tool chest

01:02:45.804 --> 01:02:47.431
"and get out your screwdriver,

01:02:47.639 --> 01:02:49.266
"and when you get
your screwdriver,"

01:02:49.474 --> 01:02:51.476
he says, "when you
get your screwdriver,

01:02:51.685 --> 01:02:52.982
"what you gotta do

01:02:53.186 --> 01:02:55.063
"is put the screwdriver

01:02:55.272 --> 01:02:57.445
"right on your belly button,

01:02:57.649 --> 01:03:01.404
"and just screw out the
screw, it'll be fine."

01:03:01.611 --> 01:03:03.079
So the guy says, "Okay."

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:04.953
So about a week later,

01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:08.118
the guy calls the
psychiatrist up,

01:03:08.326 --> 01:03:09.919
and he says, "Doctor,

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.963
"I did just what
you said, you know?

01:03:12.163 --> 01:03:14.006
"I went home and I
got out my screwdriver

01:03:14.207 --> 01:03:17.632
"and I took it and I stuck
it on my belly button

01:03:17.836 --> 01:03:20.965
"and I screwed out the
screw, I can't believe it."

01:03:21.172 --> 01:03:22.924
And the doctor says,
the psychiatrist says,

01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:23.975
"Everything worked
out all right,"

01:03:24.175 --> 01:03:25.267
he says, "See, I told you."

01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:27.068
He said, "Yeah, but
I got a problem, doc.

01:03:27.095 --> 01:03:28.722
"My ass fell off."

01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:31.399
That was very good, honey.

01:03:31.599 --> 01:03:33.852
Yeah, well, I don't
tell jokes, but, you know,

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:35.937
I can't, I can't go away.

01:03:36.146 --> 01:03:37.318
Oh, why not?

01:03:37.522 --> 01:03:39.650
I got shows to do.

01:03:39.858 --> 01:03:41.155
Oh, come on, Bo.

01:03:41.359 --> 01:03:42.861
What about the people?

01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:43.865
What people?

01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:45.788
What do you mean, what people?

01:03:45.989 --> 01:03:47.662
I mean, the
stagehands, the crew,

01:03:47.866 --> 01:03:50.961
my staff, Gene Gene
the Dancing Machine,

01:03:51.161 --> 01:03:52.538
Father Ed, they all have jobs.

01:03:52.746 --> 01:03:53.838
You're not serious.

01:03:53.997 --> 01:03:55.214
Sure, I'm serious.

01:03:55.415 --> 01:03:57.133
You know, Bo,
you're the only one

01:03:57.334 --> 01:03:58.756
you should care about right now.

01:03:58.960 --> 01:03:59.961
You won't go away.

01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:01.342
You'll never go away.

01:04:01.546 --> 01:04:02.923
You'll just work
until you wither

01:04:03.131 --> 01:04:04.508
up like an old string bean.

01:04:04.716 --> 01:04:06.639
Oh, look, Red-head,
if you're looking

01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:08.686
for me to change, forget it.

01:04:08.887 --> 01:04:11.731
I mean, this is me, and if
I'm getting on your nerves,

01:04:13.099 --> 01:04:15.067
I don't know, maybe we just

01:04:15.268 --> 01:04:16.645
should split for
a while, you know?

01:04:18.813 --> 01:04:21.111
You know, you're
becoming an itch?

01:04:22.233 --> 01:04:25.032
And I am getting on
your nerves, aren't I?

01:04:26.279 --> 01:04:28.498
I hate when you call me an itch.

01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:30.951
Yes, you are getting
on my nerves.

01:04:31.159 --> 01:04:33.039
What's happening to you
is getting on my nerves.

01:04:34.621 --> 01:04:36.840
Well, you're getting
on my nerves, too,

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:39.042
and I really think
we should split.

01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:40.250
I really do.

01:04:48.093 --> 01:04:50.642
Well, maybe that is a good idea.

01:04:50.845 --> 01:04:53.689
In fact, it is a good idea.

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:57.190
I'm moving out, I've had
enough of your looniness

01:04:57.394 --> 01:05:00.068
and craziness to
last me a lifetime.

01:05:02.148 --> 01:05:04.150
Really, you know, it's
over, we're finished,

01:05:04.359 --> 01:05:06.908
history, done, in the toilet.

01:05:07.112 --> 01:05:09.240
Oh, God, you frustrate me.

01:05:10.448 --> 01:05:12.041
You irk me.

01:05:13.076 --> 01:05:16.250
Besides, it hurts too much to
see you turn into such an ass.

01:05:16.454 --> 01:05:17.831
Listen, I'll go up to the house

01:05:18.039 --> 01:05:19.131
and get my things when
you're not around.

01:05:19.332 --> 01:05:20.584
I want my teddy bear.

01:05:20.792 --> 01:05:22.260
Here, take your vitamins.

01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:24.554
And don't forget to get
your asthma shot this week,

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:27.007
before you start wheezing
like an old bulldog.

01:05:31.678 --> 01:05:34.101
Listen, do yourself a
favor and call the Cowboys,

01:05:34.305 --> 01:05:35.727
maybe they'll make
you feel better,

01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:38.026
especially when you're in
one of your foul moods.

01:05:38.226 --> 01:05:39.352
I'll see you around, Bo.

01:06:18.933 --> 01:06:20.230
Hello?

01:06:20.435 --> 01:06:21.435
Hello, Mabel?

01:06:21.603 --> 01:06:22.695
Chuck, where are you?

01:06:22.896 --> 01:06:25.194
Everyone is in a panic,
especially Mr. Didlo.

01:06:26.441 --> 01:06:28.318
I don't know, I'm somewhere.

01:06:28.526 --> 01:06:30.824
Somewhere, now what
kind of answer is that?

01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:32.406
Why don't you know
where you are?

01:06:32.614 --> 01:06:33.957
Are you okay?

01:06:34.157 --> 01:06:36.125
What difference does it make?

01:06:36.326 --> 01:06:37.873
When will you be here?

01:06:38.077 --> 01:06:40.546
No, no, I won't be there, Mabel.

01:06:40.747 --> 01:06:43.045
I'm going to go
away, I need some,

01:06:43.249 --> 01:06:44.967
I need some peace of mind.

01:06:45.168 --> 01:06:46.795
Peace of mind?

01:06:47.003 --> 01:06:48.323
Give my love to
everybody and just

01:06:48.421 --> 01:06:50.719
tell everybody not
to worry, all right?

01:06:52.091 --> 01:06:53.138
Did Red call?

01:06:53.343 --> 01:06:54.765
Not that I know of.

01:06:54.969 --> 01:06:56.016
What do you mean
you're going away?

01:06:56.221 --> 01:06:58.349
Do you want me to check
the answering service

01:06:58.556 --> 01:06:59.728
to see if she called?

01:06:59.933 --> 01:07:02.152
No, it's okay, Mabel.

01:07:02.352 --> 01:07:03.774
BYE bye.

It's gonna be another
warm one today,

01:08:14.632 --> 01:08:15.975

loose as a goose

01:08:16.175 --> 01:08:18.849
with another big one from
Johnny Paycheck, here...

01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:35.203
Good morning, what
can I do for you?

01:08:35.403 --> 01:08:37.279
Can I just have a little
cup of coffee, please?

01:08:37.488 --> 01:08:40.037
Wait a minute, I know you.

01:08:40.241 --> 01:08:41.787
No, no, you don't, we never met.
