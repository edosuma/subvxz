03:08.375 --> 03:11.208
Rowan, wake up. We're here.

03:13.166 --> 03:14.715
Oh, shit.

03:14.750 --> 03:16.673
I must have fallen asleep.

03:16.708 --> 03:18.256
Yeah, you did.

03:18.291 --> 03:20.673
I'm glad you slept.
You needed the rest.

03:20.708 --> 03:23.041
Come on, grab your stuff.

03:44.208 --> 03:47.041
Come on,
Brendan's already inside.

03:55.666 --> 03:57.631
Hey. You were supposed
to wait for me.

03:57.666 --> 03:59.006
I was going to help you
up the path.

03:59.041 --> 04:00.590
It's fine. Rowan helped me.

04:00.625 --> 04:03.423
Stop worrying.

04:03.458 --> 04:06.750
Well, here it is,
in all its glory.

04:09.333 --> 04:11.291
Make yourself at home, Ro.

04:13.250 --> 04:16.798
This place has been
in my family forever.

04:16.833 --> 04:19.423
My brothers and I used to
come here in the summers,

04:19.458 --> 04:23.840
but I actually think
I prefer it in the winter.

04:23.875 --> 04:25.340
It's so peaceful.

04:25.375 --> 04:27.590
- Yeah.
- Hey, Em,

04:27.625 --> 04:30.631
did you pack
that bottle of aspirin?

04:30.666 --> 04:34.173
Um, yeah, it should be
in the blue backpack.

04:34.208 --> 04:37.381
He can never find anything.

04:37.416 --> 04:38.965
Do you have a headache, babe?

04:39.000 --> 04:41.506
Oh, no, no, no, I'm fine.

04:41.541 --> 04:43.756
Well, I have a bunch
of leftover painkillers

04:43.791 --> 04:45.756
if you need some.
How about you, Ro?

04:45.791 --> 04:47.756
Oh, I'm all right, thanks.

04:47.791 --> 04:50.215
Well, here's to your recovery.

04:50.250 --> 04:53.423
And, uh, welcome, Rowan.

04:53.458 --> 04:54.631
Thanks for having me.

04:59.750 --> 05:02.423
So how exactly do you two
know each other again?

05:02.458 --> 05:04.715
I told you, babe,
she works at Arbor House.

05:04.750 --> 05:06.256
Oh. Right.

05:06.291 --> 05:08.465
And how long you been
working there, Rowan?

05:08.500 --> 05:11.923
It'll be six months next week.

05:11.958 --> 05:14.215
I'm just the receptionist,
though.

05:14.250 --> 05:15.881
Nothing special.

05:15.916 --> 05:18.256
I kind of lucked out
that they were hiring.

05:18.291 --> 05:20.506
And I met Emily on my first day.

05:20.541 --> 05:23.256
Rowan was so sweet.

05:23.291 --> 05:26.048
She came up to my desk
to ask for help with the printer

05:26.083 --> 05:28.340
out of anyone in the office.

05:28.375 --> 05:30.506
I don't know.
You seemed friendly.

05:30.541 --> 05:33.048
Little did she know
I know nothing about technology.

05:34.916 --> 05:36.715
And then at
the Christmas party...

05:36.750 --> 05:38.256
You weren't there, babe.

05:38.291 --> 05:40.340
I think you were visiting
your parents or something.

05:40.375 --> 05:44.881
Jerry got drunk
and started hitting on you.

05:44.916 --> 05:49.090
And I just remember seeing
this look in your eyes

05:49.125 --> 05:53.423
and thinking, "Oh, my God,
this poor girl needs me."

05:53.458 --> 05:56.006
And we've been
friends ever since.

05:56.041 --> 05:58.631
I still can't believe
what you said to him.

05:58.666 --> 06:00.215
I could never be that bold.

06:00.250 --> 06:02.048
That guy's a total creep,
to be honest.

06:02.083 --> 06:04.798
Yeah, he's... ugh.

06:17.416 --> 06:19.756
Shit.

06:19.791 --> 06:21.215
What happened?

06:21.250 --> 06:24.465
Uh, I thought I saw
something outside.

06:24.500 --> 06:27.000
Is it...

06:37.625 --> 06:40.548
There you go. All better.

06:40.583 --> 06:42.256
There's some Band-Aids
in the washroom.

06:42.291 --> 06:45.631
- Oh.
- It's just that door back there.

06:45.666 --> 06:47.631
Okay.

07:43.541 --> 07:46.291
- Two 4s.
- One 5.

07:47.416 --> 07:48.965
One 6.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.006
Bullshit.

07:51.041 --> 07:52.881
No!

07:52.916 --> 07:54.631
She's good.
Beginner's luck.

07:54.666 --> 07:58.423
- One 4.
- Two 5s.

07:58.458 --> 08:00.715
- One 2.
- One 3.

08:00.750 --> 08:03.256
Wait. Bullshit.

08:05.625 --> 08:07.215
Whoa!

08:07.250 --> 08:08.465
Well played.

08:08.500 --> 08:11.416
- Who's playing?
- Threw out a 5.

08:12.916 --> 08:14.090
- One 4.
- Bullshit.

08:14.125 --> 08:15.465
- You can't do that!
- Bullshit!

08:15.500 --> 08:17.875
- That is not allowed.
- Bullshit.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.256
You guys are teaming up on me.

08:21.291 --> 08:22.840
I didn't even cheat.

08:29.125 --> 08:31.541
Um... two 3s.

08:34.625 --> 08:36.582
Two 4s.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.048
Can I play another one?

08:41.082 --> 08:43.000
Two 5s.

08:47.333 --> 08:48.756
Two 6s.

08:51.916 --> 08:53.756
Fire's getting kind of low.

08:53.791 --> 08:55.465
Do you mind grabbing
some wood, Brendan?

08:55.500 --> 08:57.423
I can get it.

08:57.458 --> 08:59.131
Oh, thanks, Rowan.

08:59.166 --> 09:01.798
It's just around the side there.

09:01.833 --> 09:03.625
Okay.

09:49.833 --> 09:51.673
Sewn it into the clothes
that they just donated.

09:51.708 --> 09:53.631
He lost $50,000.

09:53.666 --> 09:55.381
Ugh. What an idiot.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.673
Oh, I have a good one.

09:58.708 --> 10:00.923
So my brother told me about
this last week. It's insane.

10:00.958 --> 10:04.131
This couple that he knows
just moved into a new apartment.

10:04.166 --> 10:07.506
And after a while, they start
hearing sounds in the walls.

10:07.541 --> 10:11.006
And they don't think much of it
and blame the neighbors.

10:11.041 --> 10:14.298
And then one night,
this woman wakes up to get

10:14.333 --> 10:15.840
a glass of water,

10:15.875 --> 10:18.215
and there's a man standing
in their living room.

10:18.250 --> 10:20.840
So basically, it turns out
that he'd been living in

10:20.875 --> 10:24.590
like a secret room
behind a wall or something.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.548
- Oh, shit. That's freaky.
- Yeah.

10:26.583 --> 10:29.506
God, that's terrifying.

10:29.541 --> 10:32.715
- Yeah, for sure.
- What about you, Rowan?

10:32.750 --> 10:36.041
What's the, uh, weirdest thing
that's ever happened to you?

10:38.750 --> 10:41.000
Um...

10:42.625 --> 10:45.791
Well, one time,
someone followed me home.

10:48.083 --> 10:52.333
This woman, she, uh...

10:53.916 --> 10:55.215
...stalked me.

10:55.250 --> 10:58.215
Whoa. Are you serious?

10:58.250 --> 11:00.375
Did you call the police?

11:02.500 --> 11:06.166
Oh, it was nothing really.

11:07.250 --> 11:10.215
I don't know, she just sort of
disappeared after a while.

11:10.250 --> 11:11.881
Rowan, what you talking...

11:11.916 --> 11:14.423
Oh, fuck. I'm so sorry.

11:14.458 --> 11:15.756
- I'll grab a towel.
- It's okay.

11:15.791 --> 11:18.298
- I'm so sorry, Emily.
- It's okay.

11:18.333 --> 11:20.298
- I'm so stupid.
- No, it's okay.

11:20.333 --> 11:22.208
- Brendan's got it.
- I'm sorry.

11:23.208 --> 11:25.131
I'm sorry.

11:25.166 --> 11:27.256
Are you feeling okay?

11:27.291 --> 11:29.708
I'm great.

11:30.791 --> 11:33.625
Okay, I think it's time
for bed, Rowan.

11:37.083 --> 11:39.166
Help me take her to the bedroom.

11:43.833 --> 11:46.506
This was supposed to be
our week away, remember?

11:46.541 --> 11:48.715
Oh, come on, she's nice.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.506
You two seem to
be getting along just fine.

11:50.541 --> 11:52.715
I'm just being polite.

11:52.750 --> 11:55.416
What else do you expect me to?

11:59.541 --> 12:01.548
Should we take
off her clothes?

12:01.583 --> 12:02.923
Don't be a perv.

12:02.958 --> 12:04.798
You know that's not
what I meant.

12:04.833 --> 12:08.548
Look, I just want to spend
some time with you alone.

12:08.583 --> 12:11.215
Don't you think we need it?

12:11.250 --> 12:14.125
Can we please talk
about this later?

13:05.583 --> 13:07.798
Oh, fuck.

13:24.708 --> 13:26.416
You okay?

13:49.000 --> 13:52.756
Rowan, are you sure
you're okay?

13:52.791 --> 13:54.666
Yeah.

13:57.416 --> 14:00.715
Hey, Emily.

14:00.750 --> 14:02.131
Were you...

14:02.166 --> 14:04.000
Yeah?

14:06.375 --> 14:09.750
Never mind. I'm just tired.

14:42.125 --> 14:44.673
Feeling better?

14:44.708 --> 14:47.500
Yeah, much better. Thanks.

14:53.708 --> 14:58.208
I made you a hangover cure.

14:59.541 --> 15:02.541
Doesn't taste as bad
as it looks, I promise.

15:06.583 --> 15:09.208
See, not so bad.

15:15.708 --> 15:17.631
Where's Brendan?

15:17.666 --> 15:19.715
Oh, he's still sleeping.

15:19.750 --> 15:21.298
Yeah, you're a hard week
at work.

15:21.333 --> 15:23.131
I think he was looking forward
to the time off.

15:23.166 --> 15:26.590
Oh, sorry.

15:26.625 --> 15:30.756
Um, I hope it's
okay that I'm here.

15:30.791 --> 15:34.965
Rowan, I invited you.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.340
Of course it's okay
that you're here.

15:36.375 --> 15:38.423
We're happy to have you.

15:38.458 --> 15:40.708
Thanks.

15:47.416 --> 15:49.298
Hey, Emily.

15:49.333 --> 15:51.048
Yeah?

15:51.083 --> 15:53.465
How do you do it?

15:53.500 --> 15:55.131
Do what?

15:55.166 --> 15:57.423
You and Brendan.

15:57.458 --> 16:00.881
You both seem so happy.

16:00.916 --> 16:05.000
It's really... admirable.

16:07.750 --> 16:11.256
Well, we take care
of each other.

16:11.291 --> 16:13.375
It's as simple as that, really.

16:17.541 --> 16:21.590
So, hangover cured?

16:21.625 --> 16:23.958
You bet.

17:20.583 --> 17:23.048
Hey, what's that?

17:23.083 --> 17:25.750
Huh. Let's go take a look.

17:48.291 --> 17:50.506
It was probably a hunter.

17:50.541 --> 17:52.465
You don't know.
You could be next.

17:52.500 --> 17:54.715
He's coming for you.

17:54.750 --> 17:57.340
Probably some sick creep.

18:25.875 --> 18:27.875
Stop.

18:30.125 --> 18:32.000
Stop.

18:48.083 --> 18:50.048
Still feeling sick?

18:50.083 --> 18:52.256
Not anymore.

18:52.291 --> 18:55.041
Just can't seem
to warm up, though.

18:58.291 --> 19:00.083
Here.

19:02.708 --> 19:04.500
Thanks.

19:08.875 --> 19:10.423
Hey, Emily.

19:10.458 --> 19:12.548
Yeah?

19:12.583 --> 19:15.548
Who do you think did that
to those animals?

19:15.583 --> 19:17.423
What?

19:17.458 --> 19:19.048
The rabbits.

19:19.083 --> 19:21.881
Oh. Rowan,
don't worry about that.

19:21.916 --> 19:23.673
We were just kidding around.

19:23.708 --> 19:25.715
It's probably hunters
or something.

19:25.750 --> 19:27.215
Oh, yeah, I know.

19:27.250 --> 19:30.256
That kind of thing
is normal around here.

19:30.291 --> 19:32.840
We're not in the city anymore.

19:32.875 --> 19:35.673
Right. I know.

19:35.708 --> 19:39.465
Oh, dinner's just about ready.
It's probably five more minutes.

19:39.500 --> 19:41.423
How's your leg doing?

19:41.458 --> 19:43.965
You didn't get one for Rowan.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.006
Well, I just thought
that since...

19:46.041 --> 19:49.375
- Em, I can...
- No, it's fine, I got it.

19:57.625 --> 19:59.875
Here.

20:00.916 --> 20:03.048
Do you think that's
a good idea?

20:03.083 --> 20:05.048
It's just one
glass of wine, Brendan.

20:05.083 --> 20:07.208
It's not going to kill her.

21:02.958 --> 21:06.375
What were you talking
about last night?

21:07.041 --> 21:10.131
Sorry, what?

21:10.166 --> 21:12.423
You don't remember?

21:12.458 --> 21:17.298
You started telling us
about some stalker that you had.

21:17.333 --> 21:18.965
I don't know what
you're talking about.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.750
Yeah, you said that
someone was following you.

21:24.416 --> 21:26.548
Rowan, you don't have to tell
us if you don't want to know.

21:26.583 --> 21:28.083
No. Tell it.

21:31.125 --> 21:32.840
- Rowan.
- Come on, Em, leave her alone.

21:32.875 --> 21:34.548
No, it's fine.

21:34.583 --> 21:36.791
I'll tell it.

21:39.250 --> 21:46.173
About a month ago, this woman
came into the office.

21:46.208 --> 21:47.631
She was looking for someone,

21:47.666 --> 21:52.048
but I don't think
they worked there anymore.

21:52.083 --> 21:54.791
I didn't recognize the name.

21:56.125 --> 22:01.840
That night, when I was walking
home from work,

22:01.875 --> 22:08.416
I was unlocking the front door,
and the woman was there.

22:10.250 --> 22:13.590
At the end of my block.

22:13.625 --> 22:15.750
She was looking at me.

22:18.916 --> 22:21.965
So I waved.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.500
But she didn't wave back.

22:28.125 --> 22:31.006
I went inside.

22:31.041 --> 22:36.541
But after that, she was on
my corner every night.

22:39.166 --> 22:45.083
At first, I tried to ignore her,
hoping she would go away.

22:48.125 --> 22:51.958
One night,
I even shouted at her.

22:56.083 --> 22:58.791
I was too scared to go near her.

23:07.250 --> 23:09.625
Did they ever find out
who it was?

23:13.291 --> 23:15.041
No.

23:27.208 --> 23:29.923
Look what I just found.

23:29.958 --> 23:32.006
I have no idea
how old it is, but...

23:32.041 --> 23:33.548
Where the hell
did you find that?

23:33.583 --> 23:35.131
In the back of the closet.

23:35.166 --> 23:36.881
Wonder if my parents
left it in there.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.631
Well, I didn't take your
parents or pot smokers, Em.

23:38.666 --> 23:41.965
Hey, Randy and Diane
are cooler than you think.

23:43.708 --> 23:46.298
What do you say, Rowan?

23:46.333 --> 23:48.750
Okay, sure.

23:55.708 --> 23:58.166
- You good?
- I'm fine.

24:07.375 --> 24:09.423
Do you remember the one where
that guy is like

24:09.458 --> 24:11.256
trying to sell those
super sharp knives?

24:11.291 --> 24:13.215
And then he just
starts singing.

24:14.833 --> 24:16.840
Doesn't he start, like, rapping
at one point?

24:16.875 --> 24:18.673
Probably.

24:18.708 --> 24:22.381
Did you ever see that one
with the Christian woman?

24:22.416 --> 24:24.048
Which one's that?

24:24.083 --> 24:26.590
I don't know.
I just remember seeing it on TV

24:26.625 --> 24:29.173
a lot on some of
the late night channels.

24:29.208 --> 24:33.423
She had this huge hair
and big jewelry.

24:33.458 --> 24:35.881
I think she was selling
Bibles or something.

24:35.916 --> 24:39.590
Yeah, no, I do remember that.

24:39.625 --> 24:41.548
That was on all the time
when I was a kid.

24:41.583 --> 24:43.840
I'd completely
forgotten about it.

24:43.875 --> 24:46.340
That woman gave me the creeps.

24:46.375 --> 24:48.215
Yeah, she was terrifying.

24:48.250 --> 24:51.756
She gave me nightmares.
That grin.

24:51.791 --> 24:54.548
Oh, God, no.
You're freaking me out.

24:54.583 --> 24:56.923
I mean, how do people
even get jobs like that?

24:56.958 --> 24:58.548
It's so weird.

24:58.583 --> 25:01.381
Hey, if you had to sell
something on an infomercial,

25:01.416 --> 25:02.756
what would it be?

25:02.791 --> 25:04.840
Good question.

25:04.875 --> 25:08.465
I would maybe do like
one of those exercise videos.

25:08.500 --> 25:10.131
Why?

25:10.166 --> 25:11.840
I like the cheesy music.

25:16.208 --> 25:17.548
Fine. What would you sell then?

25:17.583 --> 25:20.381
I would definitely be
a televangelist.

25:20.416 --> 25:22.090
I'd put on
a deep Southern accent.

25:22.125 --> 25:24.840
I'd wear one of those suits
with the weird long ties.

25:24.875 --> 25:27.965
"Rowan, have accepted

25:28.000 --> 25:30.715
our Lord Jesus Christ
into your heart?

25:30.750 --> 25:34.548
Well, now you can for only
$29.99 plus tax on shipping."

25:36.250 --> 25:38.465
I would make so much money.

25:40.333 --> 25:43.666
I'm exhausted.
I think I'm going to go to bed.

25:51.666 --> 25:54.465
Brendan, sweetie,
are you coming?

25:54.500 --> 25:57.756
Uh, I think I'm going to step
a little longer.

25:57.791 --> 26:00.500
Oh. Okay.

26:02.333 --> 26:04.833
Good night, Ro.

26:08.916 --> 26:14.250
So, uh, how do you
like being a receptionist?

26:15.333 --> 26:19.881
Uh, kind of sucks,
to be honest.

26:19.916 --> 26:23.006
But I don't really know
what I want to do for real yet.

26:23.041 --> 26:27.256
Yeah, that's fair.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

26:27.291 --> 26:28.756
It's the job I had back in
Spring Hook.

26:28.791 --> 26:30.923
So I just kind of made sense
I guess.

26:30.958 --> 26:33.340
I really lucked out that
Arbor House was hiring.

26:33.375 --> 26:35.006
Spring Hook?

26:35.041 --> 26:37.673
I thought Emily told me
you're from Brookside.

26:37.708 --> 26:40.798
Yeah, right. I am. I... I am.

26:40.833 --> 26:44.131
I just lived in Spring Hook
before coming here.

26:44.166 --> 26:45.923
No way. I know some people
who live there.

26:45.958 --> 26:47.923
Well, I really
wasn't there for long.

26:47.958 --> 26:49.840
Whereabouts are you staying?

26:49.875 --> 26:51.840
South Side, I guess.

26:51.875 --> 26:56.965
Really wasn't long, though.
Where are you from?

26:57.000 --> 26:58.631
Roxton.

26:58.666 --> 27:01.881
I only moved here a few years
ago, for Emily actually.

27:01.916 --> 27:04.673
That's so sweet.

27:04.708 --> 27:07.083
Do you go back often?

27:08.291 --> 27:11.506
No, not that much.

27:11.541 --> 27:14.090
I guess it's hard with work.

27:14.125 --> 27:17.590
Plus since Emily's
been in recovery,

27:17.625 --> 27:20.333
I wanted to help her
as much as I can.

27:22.791 --> 27:27.715
Well, I'm sure
she really appreciates that.

27:27.750 --> 27:29.965
Yeah.

27:31.458 --> 27:35.465
Anyway, uh, I should
probably go to bed.

27:35.500 --> 27:38.708
Oh, yeah, me too.

27:42.125 --> 27:44.256
Good night.

27:44.291 --> 27:47.000
Night.

30:29.333 --> 30:31.500
I'm not going out there today.

30:35.416 --> 30:38.041
Rowan, you're bleeding.

33:15.833 --> 33:17.465
Oh, my God.

33:17.500 --> 33:19.631
This is from that summer
in Belmont Park.

33:19.666 --> 33:21.840
My brothers would
not stop pranking me.

33:21.875 --> 33:27.583
It got so bad that the
camp counselors eventually...

33:28.166 --> 33:30.250
What's that?

33:31.625 --> 33:34.381
Huh.

33:34.416 --> 33:36.625
Wonder that got there.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.416
We're bleeding.

34:34.625 --> 34:36.255
Here, can you drop these?

34:36.291 --> 34:39.041
Oh, sure.

34:44.791 --> 34:46.630
Hey, Rowan.

34:46.666 --> 34:48.583
Yeah?

34:50.375 --> 34:52.541
How did you cut yourself?

34:54.666 --> 34:56.708
What?

34:58.000 --> 35:00.708
This morning,
your arm was bleeding.

35:03.416 --> 35:07.256
Oh. Right. Um...

35:07.291 --> 35:09.465
On the bed frame.

35:09.500 --> 35:13.125
I-I guess there was a piece of
metal or something sticking out.

35:33.958 --> 35:35.465
Don't.

35:35.500 --> 35:38.965
What? I can't show
my affection?

35:39.000 --> 35:43.375
Rowan doesn't mind.
Do you, Rowan?

35:46.375 --> 35:48.298
Em, stop!

35:48.333 --> 35:51.250
- Come on.
- Jesus, I said stop.

35:56.708 --> 35:59.375
God. What's wrong with him?

36:06.958 --> 36:09.090
I don't think that's a word.

36:09.125 --> 36:11.048
Yes, it is.

36:11.083 --> 36:12.590
Okay, fine.

36:12.625 --> 36:14.173
Rowan, your go.

36:14.208 --> 36:17.215
Oh, okay.

36:17.250 --> 36:20.090
Uh...

36:20.125 --> 36:22.340
I don't think I have anything.

36:22.375 --> 36:25.090
You okay, Rowan?

36:25.125 --> 36:27.423
Yeah.

36:27.458 --> 36:30.041
Just a bit of a headache.

36:35.708 --> 36:38.006
Nice play.

36:38.041 --> 36:39.673
- That doesn't count.
- Why not?

36:39.708 --> 36:41.215
Because it's a proper noun.

36:41.250 --> 36:43.798
Doesn't matter.
She should get points for that.

36:43.833 --> 36:47.090
Whatever. This game
is boring anyways.

36:47.125 --> 36:48.840
- Who's for a drink?
- It's okay. I'll go get it.

36:48.875 --> 36:50.923
No, it's fine. I got it.

36:50.958 --> 36:52.131
Fuck.

36:52.166 --> 36:55.006
Must have been the storm.

36:55.041 --> 36:57.548
I know there's
a flashlight here.

36:57.583 --> 37:00.291
Shit. I can't see anything.

38:23.375 --> 38:25.708
I brought you some light.

38:30.916 --> 38:33.173
And some tea.

38:33.208 --> 38:35.541
I thought it might
help with your headache.

38:37.458 --> 38:39.131
Brendan tried calling
the power company,

38:39.166 --> 38:41.423
but he couldn't get through.

38:41.458 --> 38:43.916
Seems like the storm
hit more than just us.

38:46.333 --> 38:49.506
You should drink your tea.

38:49.541 --> 38:51.916
It'll make you feel better.

39:09.041 --> 39:11.291
Good girl.

43:59.416 --> 44:02.548
Morning, Rowan.

44:02.583 --> 44:05.506
Oh, honey,
you don't look too good.

44:05.541 --> 44:07.340
Think you might be coming down
with something.

44:07.375 --> 44:09.166
I-I'm fine.

44:10.416 --> 44:13.506
Maybe you should
go back to bed.

44:13.541 --> 44:15.958
Especially after last night.

44:17.125 --> 44:19.840
What happened last night?

44:19.875 --> 44:25.465
You were in the kitchen.
I guess you were sleepwalking.

44:25.500 --> 44:29.215
Rowan, I had to bring you back
to your room.

44:29.250 --> 44:31.208
You don't remember?

44:34.875 --> 44:39.548
Listen, um, Brendan and I
are going to go for a walk,

44:39.583 --> 44:42.166
I think it's best
if you stay here.

44:43.625 --> 44:46.166
Let's get you into bed.

44:54.666 --> 44:57.458
I'll be right back.

45:06.625 --> 45:07.965
Em, what are you doing?

45:08.000 --> 45:10.340
For Rowan.
She's not feeling well.

45:10.375 --> 45:12.131
We still going for a walk?

45:12.166 --> 45:14.125
Yes, we'll go.

45:19.416 --> 45:21.083
Knock, knock.

45:24.833 --> 45:27.125
Poor thing.

45:30.458 --> 45:33.131
Here. I brought you this.

45:33.166 --> 45:35.131
What is it?

45:35.166 --> 45:37.590
It's medicine, silly.

45:37.625 --> 45:40.333
I really think I'm okay.

45:41.625 --> 45:44.125
You don't trust me?

45:49.125 --> 45:51.125
I'm your friend.

45:55.541 --> 45:57.750
Here. Open up.

46:06.875 --> 46:08.666
Atta-girl.

46:11.375 --> 46:14.166
Now feel better.

49:16.458 --> 49:19.506
I've done everything
I can to help you.

49:19.541 --> 49:21.173
I don't understand
why you can't see that.

49:22.666 --> 49:24.631
I didn't ask for those things,
Brendan.

49:24.666 --> 49:26.666
Maybe I don't want your help.

49:53.166 --> 49:55.458
Emily?

50:18.291 --> 50:21.375
Hey. How are you holding up?

50:25.333 --> 50:27.583
I brought you some tea.

50:29.375 --> 50:32.256
Oh, Rowan, you look awful.

50:32.291 --> 50:35.381
I'm okay.

50:35.416 --> 50:37.458
You're burning up.

50:39.750 --> 50:42.708
This will help.

50:51.958 --> 50:54.631
What's that?

50:54.666 --> 50:56.958
Nothing.

50:58.750 --> 51:00.840
Rowan.

51:00.875 --> 51:02.923
I really hope
you haven't started...

51:16.708 --> 51:19.291
Is everything all right?

51:32.208 --> 51:34.458
Everything is just fine.

51:39.791 --> 51:42.458
Now drink up.

52:39.166 --> 52:40.548
It's okay, Rowan.

52:40.583 --> 52:43.000
Everything's going to be
just fine.

53:11.833 --> 53:14.000
You look like shit.

56:43.166 --> 56:44.673
Jesus Christ, Rowan.

56:44.708 --> 56:46.131
What the hell are you
doing out here?

56:46.166 --> 56:48.166
Let's get you inside.

56:56.708 --> 56:58.916
So you've sleepwalked before?

57:00.750 --> 57:02.965
Yeah.

57:03.000 --> 57:06.965
Well, you really scared me.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.041
I'm sorry.

57:12.375 --> 57:14.958
Is there something
wrong with me?

57:17.541 --> 57:19.458
Why would you say that?

57:22.250 --> 57:25.506
There wasn't anyone
following me, but...

57:45.041 --> 57:48.673
Here you go.

57:48.708 --> 57:50.215
What is that?

57:50.250 --> 57:51.548
It's just some aspirin.

57:51.583 --> 57:53.090
I thought it might
help you sleep.

57:56.958 --> 57:59.000
Shit.

58:07.208 --> 58:09.381
Am I crazy?

58:09.416 --> 58:14.340
Well, I think
you're just upset.

58:17.166 --> 58:20.881
Look, about a year after Emily
and I got together,

58:20.916 --> 58:23.340
she had a bit of a breakdown.

58:23.375 --> 58:25.131
I think it had something
to do with her sister.

58:25.166 --> 58:27.881
And I guess what
I'm trying to say is that

58:27.916 --> 58:29.715
we all go through things.

58:29.750 --> 58:31.256
What, sister?

58:31.291 --> 58:34.041
She didn't tell you?

58:34.833 --> 58:37.590
Oh.

58:37.625 --> 58:45.298
Uh, well, when Emily
was 10, her younger sister died.

58:45.333 --> 58:47.506
The whole family was
devastated, of course,

58:47.541 --> 58:52.333
but I don't think Emily
ever really got over it.

58:56.583 --> 58:58.958
I didn't know.

59:03.083 --> 59:05.458
Rowan, shit. Are you okay?

59:07.875 --> 59:10.256
Brendan told me what happened.

59:10.291 --> 59:12.500
He should have come
and woken me right away.

59:14.416 --> 59:18.756
Rowan, you can't
leave like that.

59:18.791 --> 59:21.215
I worry about you.

59:21.250 --> 59:23.666
I know.

59:34.916 --> 59:38.250
Emily, I need to
tell you something.

59:40.625 --> 59:42.833
Yeah?

59:43.916 --> 59:47.965
There wasn't anyone
following me.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.083
- I was the one...
- I know.

01:00:02.291 --> 01:00:05.465
The first time I saw you,
you were getting in your car

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:08.340
on the way to work.

01:00:08.375 --> 01:00:12.548
You just looked so put together.

01:00:12.583 --> 01:00:16.791
You looked... content.

01:00:18.041 --> 01:00:21.125
And I wanted to know more.

01:00:23.541 --> 01:00:27.833
And the first time
that I saw you and Brendan...

01:00:30.250 --> 01:00:33.958
And the way you looked
at each other.

01:00:35.708 --> 01:00:39.625
I didn't know that kind
of happiness was possible.

01:00:43.875 --> 01:00:45.666
It's not.

01:00:52.791 --> 01:00:55.625
But it helps to have people
to take care of.

01:01:04.208 --> 01:01:06.458
Are you mad at me?

01:01:10.375 --> 01:01:13.048
No.

01:01:17.250 --> 01:01:23.375
Sometimes we do crazy things
to find our friends.

01:01:34.541 --> 01:01:39.048
Brendan told me
about your sister.

01:01:39.083 --> 01:01:41.333
Oh.

01:01:43.791 --> 01:01:48.590
I'm so, so sorry.

01:01:48.625 --> 01:01:51.666
It's okay.

01:01:53.666 --> 01:01:56.000
He loves you so much.

01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:02.416
I think I'm losing him.

01:02:06.375 --> 01:02:09.083
But I don't know if I care.

01:02:19.833 --> 01:02:22.458
Will you promise me something?

01:02:24.666 --> 01:02:27.000
What?

01:02:32.333 --> 01:02:35.125
Promise me you'll never leave.

01:02:39.291 --> 01:02:41.458
I promise.

01:02:52.875 --> 01:02:55.208
I'm so tired.

01:02:59.333 --> 01:03:02.881
Just sleep.

01:03:02.916 --> 01:03:05.083
You'll feel better soon.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.506
Fuck, Emily, it's lucky
she didn't freeze to death.

01:03:15.541 --> 01:03:18.458
Yes, that is lucky.

01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:22.881
Emily, we need to take her
back to the city.

01:03:22.916 --> 01:03:24.840
We need to end this.

01:03:24.875 --> 01:03:27.673
This is the best place for
Rowan to be right now.

01:03:27.708 --> 01:03:31.750
Here, with me.
So I can take care of her.

01:03:33.875 --> 01:03:36.048
And what about me, Em?

01:03:36.083 --> 01:03:38.340
What about you?

01:03:38.375 --> 01:03:40.715
I can't be a part of this.

01:04:18.791 --> 01:04:21.465
He had to go into town.

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:23.125
He had to get, um...

01:04:46.416 --> 01:04:48.798
Hey.

01:04:48.833 --> 01:04:50.125
I made dinner.

01:04:52.250 --> 01:04:53.958
Hi.

01:05:03.166 --> 01:05:05.298
There you go.

01:05:05.333 --> 01:05:07.083
Thanks, Rowan.

01:05:19.375 --> 01:05:22.923
How are you doing?

01:05:22.958 --> 01:05:24.625
I've been better.

01:05:37.416 --> 01:05:39.048
How are you feeling?

01:05:39.083 --> 01:05:40.965
Are you still feeling sick?

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.631
Better, actually.

01:05:42.666 --> 01:05:44.631
Much better.

01:05:44.666 --> 01:05:46.125
Oh, good.

01:05:51.833 --> 01:05:55.048
I never understood
why he liked me anyway.

01:05:55.083 --> 01:05:56.340
Brendan?

01:05:56.375 --> 01:05:58.166
Maybe he never actually did.

01:06:01.125 --> 01:06:05.256
Ever since my accident,
he's been helping so much,

01:06:05.291 --> 01:06:07.381
but...

01:06:07.416 --> 01:06:11.041
it's like the more he helps,
the less he actually cares.

01:06:12.791 --> 01:06:15.208
As if he's just going
through the motions.

01:06:19.625 --> 01:06:22.291
It's so much easier to make
someone need you.

01:06:24.666 --> 01:06:28.631
But for them to actually
like you?

01:06:28.666 --> 01:06:30.625
Like who you are?

01:06:34.458 --> 01:06:36.208
It's so much more rare.

01:06:47.708 --> 01:06:49.881
Why don't I make us a drink?

01:06:49.916 --> 01:06:52.381
Oh, okay, sure.

01:06:52.416 --> 01:06:53.881
Do you want me to go get it?

01:06:53.916 --> 01:06:55.791
It's okay. I got it.

01:07:17.625 --> 01:07:20.465
Cheers.

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:21.923
Cheers.

01:12:03.958 --> 01:12:08.166
Rowan, you need to stop
hurting yourself.

01:12:09.916 --> 01:12:13.041
Why have you been
doing this to me?

01:12:14.916 --> 01:12:16.673
I'm helping you, Rowan.

01:12:16.708 --> 01:12:19.590
You're hurting me.

01:12:19.625 --> 01:12:22.173
I found your box.

01:12:22.208 --> 01:12:24.048
It's gonna be okay.

01:12:24.083 --> 01:12:25.631
- No.
- I'm gonna make

01:12:25.666 --> 01:12:27.465
- everything better.
- No, I found your box!

01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:29.131
It's okay, Rowan.
It's okay, Rowan.

01:12:29.166 --> 01:12:30.131
I found your box!

01:12:30.166 --> 01:12:31.756
I'm gonna make it better.

01:12:35.375 --> 01:12:37.090
Oh, look,
you're bleeding.

01:12:37.125 --> 01:12:40.090
No! Get the fuck away from me!

01:12:43.958 --> 01:12:46.090
Rowan?

01:12:46.125 --> 01:12:49.381
Open the door.

01:12:49.416 --> 01:12:52.673
Please open the door.

01:12:52.708 --> 01:12:55.381
I'm gonna make it okay, Rowan.

01:12:55.416 --> 01:12:57.125
I'm gonna make it better.

01:12:59.125 --> 01:13:02.590
You told me
that you weren't gonna leave.

01:13:02.625 --> 01:13:05.340
You promised me, Rowan.

01:13:05.375 --> 01:13:06.881
Let me out.

01:13:08.375 --> 01:13:10.048
Let me out!

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.131
Rowan.

01:16:16.833 --> 01:16:19.048
I'm just gonna go
open the door.

01:17:12.465 --> 01:17:15.254
