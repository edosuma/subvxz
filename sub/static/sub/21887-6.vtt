WEBVTT

00:00.914 --> 00:03.351
- <i>Previously on "Gotham"...</i>
- We will bust Penguin one day,

00:03.391 --> 00:04.357
I promise you.

00:04.392 --> 00:05.825
Harvey, we cannot let this slide.

00:05.860 --> 00:08.628
You find someone
with the license, they walk.

00:08.663 --> 00:10.963
Ms. Falcone, I need
to know that you are not

00:10.999 --> 00:13.399
on some fool's errand to
rebuild your father's empire.

00:13.434 --> 00:14.934
An example needs to be made.

00:14.969 --> 00:16.902
SOFIA: You may think
you have everything,

00:16.938 --> 00:18.971
but there is one thing you don't have:

00:19.007 --> 00:20.006
the Falcone name.

00:20.041 --> 00:21.007
GORDON: Was that your plan?

00:21.042 --> 00:24.310
Get close to Penguin.
Gain his confidence. What then?

00:24.345 --> 00:26.746
NYGMA: I used to be smart, brilliant,

00:26.781 --> 00:27.880
and now that's gone.

00:29.250 --> 00:32.051
MAN: Never seen nothing like him before.

00:32.086 --> 00:33.219
(roaring)

00:33.254 --> 00:34.754
Who are you?

00:34.789 --> 00:37.123
MAN (on recording): Solomon Grundy.

00:37.158 --> 00:40.393
You... know... Grundy?

00:40.428 --> 00:42.194
We're the very best of friends.

00:42.230 --> 00:45.398
NYGMA: With your muscles,
we can make money.

00:45.433 --> 00:48.200
- We'd like to put our hat in the ring.
- Go get the doc.

00:50.872 --> 00:53.506
(indistinct shouting)

00:53.541 --> 00:54.940
MAN: Come on!

00:54.976 --> 00:58.644
(grunting)

01:00.615 --> 01:04.083
(indistinct, overlapping shouting)

01:04.117 --> 01:06.452
(audience groaning)

01:08.690 --> 01:09.822
Hey!

01:09.857 --> 01:11.857
(audience cheering)

01:15.196 --> 01:16.562
(bones crack, man grunts)

01:16.597 --> 01:17.997
Good as new.

01:25.406 --> 01:27.340
Dr. Lee Thompkins.

01:27.375 --> 01:30.776
Oh... my. (laughing)

01:30.812 --> 01:33.512
Now, what is a girl like you
doing in a place like this?

01:33.548 --> 01:35.181
I heard a rumor you were frozen.

01:35.216 --> 01:37.283
Should've known
it was too good to be true.

01:37.318 --> 01:39.485
Oh, you're not still mad at me, are you?

01:39.520 --> 01:41.821
Mad at you for what?

01:41.856 --> 01:43.456
Killing Kristen Kringle?

01:43.491 --> 01:46.135
Or framing Jim for murder
so he would be in prison

01:46.160 --> 01:48.627
when I lost our child? No.

01:48.663 --> 01:50.930
I'm over all that.

01:50.965 --> 01:53.332
Let's be friends.

01:53.368 --> 01:55.768
I'm sensing sarcasm.

01:55.803 --> 01:57.536
(pours drink) Just as sharp as ever.

01:57.572 --> 01:59.872
Actually, funny that you mention that.

01:59.907 --> 02:00.940
Good-bye, Ed.

02:00.975 --> 02:02.675
- Wait.
- (groans)

02:03.711 --> 02:04.777
Holy hell.

02:04.812 --> 02:07.513
Butch Gilzean?

02:07.548 --> 02:09.548
What have you done to him?

02:09.584 --> 02:11.150
Nothing, believe it or not.

02:11.185 --> 02:12.852
And he goes by "Grundy" now.

02:12.887 --> 02:14.954
Hey, why don't you hang
over there, big fella?

02:14.989 --> 02:16.622
Make sure that wall doesn't wander off.

02:16.657 --> 02:18.691
(growls): Mm.

02:21.629 --> 02:23.796
I have no idea what happened to him,

02:23.831 --> 02:25.965
but he's freakishly strong,

02:26.000 --> 02:28.367
can't remember anything
about his past life,

02:28.403 --> 02:31.129
and he seems to love me,
so, big improvement.

02:31.168 --> 02:33.005
But, I, on the other hand...

02:33.040 --> 02:36.509
I'm, uh... I'm really hoping
to get back to who I was.

02:36.544 --> 02:40.379
When I was on ice, my head
got a little... scrambled.

02:40.415 --> 02:41.747
Why should I care?

02:41.783 --> 02:43.749
Okay, I came here with Grundy,

02:43.785 --> 02:46.318
gonna fight, make some money
to get me smart again.

02:46.354 --> 02:50.222
But... you...

02:50.258 --> 02:52.658
Dr. Leslie Thompkins...

02:52.693 --> 02:54.560
you can fix me.

02:54.595 --> 02:58.397
You want me to fix you?

02:58.433 --> 03:00.566
Oh, you really are dumb.

03:00.601 --> 03:01.867
Okay, okay.

03:01.903 --> 03:03.769
You're here for some reason.

03:03.805 --> 03:06.539
I don't pretend
to know what that is, but...

03:06.574 --> 03:08.541
if you help me,

03:08.576 --> 03:11.110
I will help you.

03:11.145 --> 03:12.945
I know you're not
really smart right now,

03:12.980 --> 03:15.347
so just try to understand this.

03:15.383 --> 03:17.383
I will never help you.

03:22.723 --> 03:25.124
- I was raised to be a gentleman.
- (thunder rumbles)

03:25.159 --> 03:26.492
SOFIA: But you're also practical.

03:26.527 --> 03:29.762
We were seen at dinner, as we
have been the past three nights.

03:29.797 --> 03:33.132
All of Gotham knows you have the
support of the Falcone family.

03:33.167 --> 03:36.702
And I'm fairly certain
no one's watching us now.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.138
I...

03:39.173 --> 03:40.840
(thunder rumbles)

03:40.875 --> 03:44.677
I just... I just like
to know where I stand.

03:49.083 --> 03:51.083
This isn't easy for me.

03:52.553 --> 03:55.387
To have someone I can trust.

03:56.691 --> 03:58.891
A real friend.

04:00.000 --> 04:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:07.668 --> 04:10.469
You can trust me.

04:11.506 --> 04:13.806
Let's have lunch tomorrow, just us.

04:15.643 --> 04:17.642
Till then.

04:22.149 --> 04:24.583
(door opens, rain falling)

04:24.619 --> 04:26.619
(door closes)

04:32.793 --> 04:34.660
Have a nice dinner?

04:36.397 --> 04:38.030
How long have you been here?

04:38.065 --> 04:39.398
Long enough.

04:39.433 --> 04:41.567
It's time you tell me
what you're planning.

04:41.602 --> 04:43.302
This again?

04:44.304 --> 04:45.804
Ever since you've come to Gotham,

04:45.840 --> 04:48.207
all you've done is make Oswald stronger.

04:48.242 --> 04:50.042
- (drink pouring)
- It's time I know your end game.

04:51.846 --> 04:53.779
And if I refuse?

04:54.524 --> 04:56.682
I'll put you on a train home.

05:04.792 --> 05:06.792
I want to make you a promise.

05:06.827 --> 05:08.060
In a matter of days,

05:08.095 --> 05:10.529
I'll have Cobblepot
in the palm of my hand.

05:11.732 --> 05:14.433
If I fail, I'll stay, I'll go,

05:14.812 --> 05:17.069
whatever you want.

05:24.445 --> 05:27.346
(distant sirens, rolling thunder)

05:29.807 --> 05:31.984
Look, the count's good.

05:32.213 --> 05:34.086
Oh, now, go on. Get out of here.

05:34.221 --> 05:36.021
- I'll see you next month.
- Yeah.

05:43.397 --> 05:46.065
(growling)

05:46.100 --> 05:48.100
Someone down there?

05:55.643 --> 05:57.643
(low, rolling thunder)

06:20.501 --> 06:22.468
(door creaks open)

06:22.503 --> 06:24.770
(mewing)

06:24.805 --> 06:26.749
(chuckles)

06:26.774 --> 06:28.407
Freakin' cats.

06:28.442 --> 06:30.442
(mewing)

06:31.445 --> 06:33.112
MALE VOICE: Oink. Oink.

06:33.147 --> 06:34.747
What the...?

06:35.734 --> 06:40.735
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx
<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

06:41.822 --> 06:43.756
(indistinct radio chatter, siren blaring)

06:43.791 --> 06:45.124
Hey.

06:45.159 --> 06:47.059
It really one of ours?

06:47.094 --> 06:49.428
Seems so. He was in the uniform,

06:49.463 --> 06:51.096
but the killer took his badge.

06:51.132 --> 06:53.065
No one recognizes him?

06:53.100 --> 06:55.901
Well, that part
we have not figured out yet.

06:57.071 --> 06:59.071
Let me show you.

06:59.106 --> 07:01.507
(camera snapping)

07:01.542 --> 07:02.808
Good God.

07:02.843 --> 07:04.443
Freaky, huh?

07:04.478 --> 07:06.245
Let's find out who this guy is.

07:06.280 --> 07:08.814
(distant siren blaring)

07:08.849 --> 07:10.849
Here we go.

07:15.417 --> 07:17.823
Dave Metzger. You know him?

07:17.858 --> 07:19.358
Seen him around.

07:19.393 --> 07:22.294
Not to speak ill of the dead,
but he was a grade A bastard.

07:22.563 --> 07:25.297
- He have enemies on the force?
- No. No cop would do this

07:25.332 --> 07:27.633
to another cop, but he was the candyman.

07:27.867 --> 07:30.436
Penguin's bagman. He was
the one delivering

07:30.471 --> 07:32.004
payoffs to cops in the precinct.

07:32.039 --> 07:34.106
- I mean, that-that's the rumor.
- Yeah.

07:34.546 --> 07:36.513
So someone killed him to send a message.

07:36.672 --> 07:38.177
(helicopter passing overhead)

07:38.212 --> 07:40.179
- Where you going?
- To see Penguin.

07:40.214 --> 07:43.382
Maybe he knows why someone
wanted to kill his employee.

07:43.417 --> 07:45.818
Don't go stirring the pot!

07:46.854 --> 07:49.054
Enjoy your lunch, Mr. Cobblepot.

07:50.558 --> 07:52.558
I need to talk to you.

07:52.593 --> 07:55.461
If it takes less than three
minutes, I'm all ears.

07:55.496 --> 07:57.329
A cop was murdered last night.

07:57.364 --> 07:59.198
Dave Metzger?

07:59.709 --> 08:01.840
A bagman on your payroll.

08:01.918 --> 08:03.836
Oh, and you think I
might know something.

08:03.871 --> 08:07.072
Well, sadly, this is the
first I'm hearing his name.

08:07.108 --> 08:09.842
A general does not need
to know every foot soldier.

08:09.877 --> 08:11.910
You don't need to know him.

08:11.946 --> 08:14.313
I think someone is trying
to send you a message.

08:15.344 --> 08:17.351
What sort of message?

08:17.688 --> 08:22.054
The killer placed a severed
pig's head over Metzger's own.

08:22.089 --> 08:24.256
Not a very clear message.

08:24.291 --> 08:26.825
Could have all sorts of meanings.

08:26.861 --> 08:29.228
Metzger may have been dirty,
but he was still a cop.

08:29.263 --> 08:32.231
Someone killed him and is using
his death to make a point.

08:32.265 --> 08:34.566
If that is in relation
to you, I need to know.

08:34.602 --> 08:35.581
(laughs)

08:35.620 --> 08:38.035
Jim, if someone had a problem with me,

08:38.072 --> 08:41.073
I would know about it,
and I would deal with it.

08:43.110 --> 08:45.911
I guess you're always
one step ahead, Oswald.

08:45.946 --> 08:48.981
It's why I'm alive.

08:49.016 --> 08:50.949
But I would like to help.

08:50.977 --> 08:53.344
- Mr. Penn!
- Right here, Mr. Cobblepot.

08:53.387 --> 08:56.221
Do we have anything that
could assist Detective Gordon

08:56.257 --> 08:57.756
in doing his job?

08:57.792 --> 09:00.359
As a matter of fact, sir,
a few days ago,

09:00.394 --> 09:03.629
Mr. Wally Clarke applied
for a burglary permit.

09:04.839 --> 09:06.365
The Pork Barrel.

09:06.542 --> 09:09.101
It's a butcher on Third Street.

09:09.136 --> 09:10.302
They specialize in offering

09:10.337 --> 09:12.271
- the whole...
- Thanks... for the lead.

09:12.306 --> 09:13.972
Enjoy your lunch, Oswald.

09:14.008 --> 09:15.941
- (sniffs)
- Don't thank me, Jim.

09:15.976 --> 09:18.671
Thank the licensing
system you hate so much.

09:20.101 --> 09:24.082
Now, be sure to let me know if
I need to get more involved.

09:24.967 --> 09:27.873
Till then, I'm rooting for you, Jim!

09:28.589 --> 09:31.824
(opera plays with man singing
in foreign language)

09:31.859 --> 09:35.894
(man sings along with recording)

09:39.433 --> 09:41.433
(singing continues)

09:59.620 --> 10:01.620
(man on recording holding final note)

10:01.655 --> 10:03.440
(man on recording laughs)

10:07.974 --> 10:10.536
Ah, have a seat, Wally.

10:10.646 --> 10:13.122
You know how much trouble you're in? Huh?

10:13.396 --> 10:14.884
You know what we do to cop killers?

10:14.939 --> 10:16.869
- Just told him, I didn't kill nobody,
- (handcuffs tighten)

10:16.923 --> 10:18.674
specifically not no cop.

10:18.709 --> 10:21.009
Oh, so you didn't lure
Dave Metzger into that alley,

10:21.045 --> 10:23.498
split open his skull,
and stick a pig's head on him?!

10:23.569 --> 10:25.836
(laughing): What?! Are you crazy?

10:25.871 --> 10:28.131
It's funny, because we
searched the Dumpster

10:28.170 --> 10:29.513
behind your apartment.

10:29.538 --> 10:31.279
Guess what we found.

10:31.744 --> 10:33.210
BULLOCK: Whoa-ho!

10:33.245 --> 10:35.812
Look at that. Porky don't have no head.

10:36.450 --> 10:38.567
GORDON: What do you want to bet

10:38.661 --> 10:42.349
that head was on the dead cop we found?

10:42.427 --> 10:43.921
BULLOCK: Screw it!

10:43.956 --> 10:46.290
I have enough.
I don't need a confession.

10:46.325 --> 10:48.926
I'm charging you
with the murder of Dave Metzger!

10:48.961 --> 10:51.361
Wait! No. It wasn't me.

10:52.841 --> 10:54.665
It must have been the Prof.

10:54.700 --> 10:55.699
Who?

10:55.734 --> 10:57.367
The Professor. That's what I called him

10:57.403 --> 10:59.303
because he-he talked all fancy.

10:59.338 --> 11:01.238
He was the one who got
me to rob the butcher's.

11:01.273 --> 11:03.206
We need a name, a description.

11:03.242 --> 11:04.875
We did it all over the phone.
The whole deal.

11:04.910 --> 11:07.444
I-I dropped the heads under
the Midtown Bridge.

11:07.479 --> 11:08.716
The money was there.
I never met the guy,

11:08.769 --> 11:09.846
never got no name.

11:09.882 --> 11:12.153
What do you mean, "heads"?
As in more than one?

11:12.178 --> 11:13.517
How many did this guy want?

11:13.552 --> 11:15.118
It was... there was four.

11:15.154 --> 11:18.221
You'd think he could've told me
that he only needed the heads.

11:18.257 --> 11:21.091
But, no, I had to drag 'em
to my house, chop the heads...

11:21.126 --> 11:22.592
Hey, shut up!

11:25.026 --> 11:26.658
You know what this means?

11:26.750 --> 11:29.132
Yeah. It means there's
three more victims out there.

11:29.168 --> 11:31.936
How many bagmen did
Penguin have on the GCPD?

11:31.975 --> 11:35.072
Wild guess, I'd say four.
The only one I knew was Metzger.

11:35.380 --> 11:38.147
Yeah, well, the people who
got paid by those bagmen,

Never showed.

17:21.923 --> 17:24.723

taken somewhere, killed,

his message is important.

22:47.546 --> 22:50.127
All right. That was the mayor's office.

22:50.152 --> 22:53.016
Press has gotten wind.
Things are gonna heat up fast.

22:53.051 --> 22:54.384
Then we catch him fast.

22:54.419 --> 22:56.119
All the cops who haven't called in.

22:58.256 --> 22:59.923
Hahn. Peterson.

22:59.958 --> 23:02.826
King. Nakajima. Messengale.

23:02.851 --> 23:05.034
Yeah. So, their precincts
are already looking for them,

23:05.068 --> 23:07.063
but I say we take this list to Penguin,

23:07.099 --> 23:09.056
- have him point to a name.
- No need.

23:09.252 --> 23:10.851
Nakajima's the bagman.

23:10.886 --> 23:12.286
How do you know?

23:12.321 --> 23:15.122
Peterson and Messengale are
both hard-core Bible-thumpers.

23:15.157 --> 23:16.757
That leaves three.

23:16.792 --> 23:19.093
And I've heard Nakajima's dirty.

23:19.128 --> 23:20.961

on the way to his apartment,

23:20.997 --> 23:22.062

23:22.098 --> 23:23.530

Concentrate our resources. Jim, hold on.

23:29.171 --> 23:31.805
Doesn't something about this
feel weird to you?

23:31.841 --> 23:34.775
Whoever set the trap for
Metzger knew where he'd be.

23:34.810 --> 23:37.878
And the killer also knew Butler
and Whitlock's schedules.

23:37.913 --> 23:39.947
Are you saying it's one of our own?

23:39.982 --> 23:42.549
Someone who's fed up with the
corruption, decided to make a stand.

23:42.585 --> 23:43.751
But to kill them,

23:43.786 --> 23:45.519
- display their bodies that way...
- I know,

23:45.554 --> 23:48.455
brother, but it's something
we at least have to consider.

23:48.491 --> 23:51.358

say out there... (knocking)

I'd gotten word

a secret buyer had purchased
the hotel at six percent

36:07.746 --> 36:09.136
It was unavoidable.

36:09.171 --> 36:10.938
You have to let me make it up to you.

36:10.973 --> 36:12.072
How about now?

36:12.925 --> 36:14.722
I was actually on my way out.

36:14.773 --> 36:17.581
Oh. Hmm. Where to?

36:18.781 --> 36:20.247
This is going to sound strange,

36:20.283 --> 36:23.350
but I can't tell you.

36:23.386 --> 36:25.920
Not yet. I-I want it to be a surprise.

36:25.955 --> 36:28.556
The thing is...

36:30.693 --> 36:32.426
...cat's out of the bag.

36:32.461 --> 36:34.094
I don't understand.

36:34.130 --> 36:35.930
I know what you're doing!

36:36.301 --> 36:38.599
The old Heritage Hotel.

36:38.634 --> 36:40.701
The fortress from which
you're going to attack me.

36:41.151 --> 36:43.470
What? No.

36:43.506 --> 36:46.373
Oh. Oh, so you weren't
pretending to be my friend

36:46.409 --> 36:47.808
while building your power base?

36:47.843 --> 36:49.677
(laughing)

36:49.712 --> 36:51.820
I should have known.

36:51.948 --> 36:53.447
But, you know,

36:53.482 --> 36:57.318
your father's blood definitely
runs through your veins.

36:57.353 --> 36:59.053
Luckily, not for long.

36:59.088 --> 37:01.155
Oswald, you're making a mistake.

37:01.190 --> 37:02.823
I'm your friend.

37:03.859 --> 37:05.826
We'll see, won't we?

37:05.861 --> 37:08.562
Now, let's go see what you're building.

37:08.598 --> 37:10.864
I can't wait!

37:10.900 --> 37:12.900
(indistinct chatter)

37:15.204 --> 37:17.805
Barkeep, another grasshopper.

37:17.840 --> 37:19.139
Those won't help.

37:19.618 --> 37:22.309
- All right, give me your money.
- What?

37:22.345 --> 37:23.978
The money you made...
well, that he made...

37:24.013 --> 37:26.013
give it to me.

37:30.786 --> 37:33.287
I don't make any promises,
but I'll see what I can do.

37:33.322 --> 37:34.688
Lee. Lee.

37:34.724 --> 37:36.090
I just got to know.

37:36.125 --> 37:38.092
Why did you change your mind?

37:38.127 --> 37:39.660
Is it my charisma?

37:39.695 --> 37:41.095
Close.

37:41.341 --> 37:43.775
You asked what I was doing
in a place like this.

37:43.800 --> 37:45.165
I don't want to be here.

37:45.201 --> 37:46.734
I don't want to be anywhere near Gotham.

37:46.769 --> 37:47.935
I left.

37:47.970 --> 37:49.637
But I couldn't stay away

37:50.185 --> 37:52.206
because of the Tetch virus.

37:52.349 --> 37:54.583
It hit the Narrows
harder than anywhere else.

37:54.610 --> 37:55.876
So?

37:55.911 --> 37:58.512
So? It was my fault.

37:58.547 --> 38:00.881
Jim tried to stop the
virus and I didn't let him.

38:00.916 --> 38:04.685
I was infected, but nonetheless,
I was there.

38:04.720 --> 38:06.754
I don't have a choice.
I have to be here.

38:06.789 --> 38:07.955
Wow.

38:10.359 --> 38:12.226
If you wanted to
blackmail me, by the way,

38:12.261 --> 38:14.173
what you should have
done was taken advantage

38:14.198 --> 38:15.562
of Grundy being popular,

38:15.598 --> 38:17.131
threatened to take him away,

38:17.166 --> 38:19.033
and then Cherry, afraid
of losing her star,

38:19.068 --> 38:21.135
would have forced me to help you.

38:24.707 --> 38:26.240
Come by the clinic tomorrow.

38:26.275 --> 38:27.741
We'll get started.

38:27.777 --> 38:29.697
Hi, pretty lady.

38:34.250 --> 38:36.884
Ed's gonna be smart again.

38:36.919 --> 38:39.832
Ed's gonna be smart?

38:39.989 --> 38:42.756
Ed's gonna be very smart.

38:42.792 --> 38:44.491
Hey.

38:48.764 --> 38:50.764
It's okay, Charlie.

38:52.234 --> 38:54.262
Oswald.

38:55.791 --> 38:57.924
I want you to know I forgive you.

38:58.007 --> 39:00.007
(children yelling and laughing)

39:03.646 --> 39:05.396
ZSASZ: Uh, boss.

39:06.521 --> 39:08.082
OSWALD: What is this?

39:08.248 --> 39:09.983
What's happening?

39:10.019 --> 39:11.952
(chuckles) Kids.

39:16.941 --> 39:20.060
You started an orphanage?

39:20.449 --> 39:22.196
I wanted to surprise you next week

39:22.231 --> 39:23.664
when everything was finished.

39:24.846 --> 39:26.245
I...

39:26.302 --> 39:29.221
- I...
- WOMAN: Children. Back inside, please!

39:30.606 --> 39:32.172
Oswald, I want you to know

39:32.208 --> 39:34.983
I understand the pressure you face.

39:35.211 --> 39:37.711
Your very survival
depends on seeing everyone

39:37.747 --> 39:39.436
as a potential threat.

39:39.715 --> 39:42.975
And I watched my father
bear that weight for years.

39:44.280 --> 39:46.244
I don't want you to end up like him.

39:48.290 --> 39:50.324
Sofia, please forgive me.

39:51.927 --> 39:53.666
How can I?

39:53.896 --> 39:55.977
(chuckles) When I've
already forgiven you?

39:58.367 --> 39:59.733
But you do owe me one thing.

39:59.769 --> 40:00.901
Anything.

40:00.936 --> 40:03.070
Lunch.

40:03.105 --> 40:05.598
How do you feel about mac and cheese?

40:06.742 --> 40:08.208
I love it.

40:09.411 --> 40:12.346
(train whistle blows)

40:12.381 --> 40:14.381
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

40:18.128 --> 40:20.087
GORDON: Hey.

40:21.924 --> 40:23.753
Hey.

40:23.959 --> 40:25.993
(exhaling): You gave me
quite the scare back there.

40:26.028 --> 40:27.652
How are you feeling?

40:30.237 --> 40:32.413
I've had better days.

40:34.503 --> 40:36.436
Doc says you're gonna be okay.

40:36.472 --> 40:38.761
That shows what he knows.

40:39.341 --> 40:40.902
Pyg?

40:41.941 --> 40:44.111
Son of a bitch.

40:44.448 --> 40:45.612
He could have killed me,

40:45.648 --> 40:47.347
but he cut me just deep enough

40:47.383 --> 40:49.316
to make you choose to go after him

40:50.051 --> 40:52.145
or save my worthless hide.

40:52.536 --> 40:54.121
It wasn't a choice.

40:55.536 --> 40:57.653
Either way, I owe you.

41:00.763 --> 41:02.472
So pay it back now.

41:03.532 --> 41:05.465
Tell me the truth.

41:05.501 --> 41:07.634
How long you been taking money
from Penguin?

41:09.905 --> 41:11.913
You knew Metzger was the bagman.

41:12.041 --> 41:14.475
You knew Nakajima was dirty.

41:15.147 --> 41:17.978
The Pyg says all this stuff

41:18.013 --> 41:20.280
about you deserving to be killed.

41:21.617 --> 41:23.584
I don't know why I didn't see it before.

41:23.619 --> 41:25.563
Maybe I didn't want to.

41:28.824 --> 41:31.132
I just need to know how long.

41:31.483 --> 41:33.026
We talking years?

41:33.062 --> 41:34.294
No.

41:34.330 --> 41:36.960
Just since this license crap started.

41:38.500 --> 41:41.815
The commissioner ordered us to comply.

41:42.638 --> 41:44.504
Then Metzger started showing up

41:44.540 --> 41:46.607
with these envelopes
stuffed full of cash.

41:48.043 --> 41:51.361
I didn't do nothing I
wouldn't have done anyway.

41:52.759 --> 41:54.348
You got to understand, Jim.

41:54.383 --> 41:57.484
The bills I got, the debts I got.

41:58.259 --> 41:59.947
It stops.

42:01.824 --> 42:03.423
It stops now.

42:09.131 --> 42:11.131
(sniffles)

42:13.102 --> 42:15.002
TV REPORTER:
<i>...has the city on high alert.</i>

42:15.037 --> 42:17.304
<i>Gotham finds itself gripped by terror</i>

42:17.339 --> 42:19.473
<i>at the hands of a
ritualistic cop killer,</i>

42:19.508 --> 42:21.541
<i>being called Professor Pyg.</i>

42:21.577 --> 42:24.645
<i>He is still at large
after evading the police.</i>

42:24.680 --> 42:27.481
The GCPD are urging people
to remain calm

42:27.516 --> 42:29.616
<i>and to report any suspicious activity</i>

42:29.652 --> 42:32.352
<i>to GCPD's Central Command.</i>

42:32.388 --> 42:34.388
(crickets chirping)

42:37.459 --> 42:39.843
PYG: Two mother pigs

42:40.162 --> 42:41.794
lived in a pen.

42:42.083 --> 42:44.566
They each had four piglets.

42:45.238 --> 42:47.238
And that made ten.

42:47.933 --> 42:50.657
All the piglets loved to play.

42:50.806 --> 42:56.344
And they rolled and they rolled
in the mud, all day.

42:56.698 --> 42:58.245
At night,

42:58.346 --> 43:00.346
with their mothers,

43:00.753 --> 43:02.753
crawled up in a heap,

43:03.589 --> 43:06.893
they screamed and they screamed

43:07.065 --> 43:10.625
until they went...

43:11.835 --> 43:13.493
to sleep.

43:14.805 --> 43:17.837
And sleep well for tomorrow

43:18.024 --> 43:20.845
the axe shall fall.
