10:24.749 --> 10:27.168
Oh, just a little.

10:29.796 --> 10:34.217
OK, Petey... So it cost ya
a teensy bit extra.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.219
That new game room's

10:36.302 --> 10:39.514
gonna make this house worth
its weight in gold.

10:39.597 --> 10:41.182
[Goofy] Pete!

10:41.266 --> 10:42.642
I just wanted to be with you

10:42.726 --> 10:44.769
when you see what we did. Ah-hyuck!

10:44.853 --> 10:48.148
Yeah, that's nice, but you know, Goofer,

10:48.231 --> 10:50.984
major remodelin' can be a real strain

10:51.067 --> 10:53.361
on a person's central nervous system.

10:53.445 --> 10:55.405
But I'll tell you,
when opportunity knocks,

10:55.488 --> 10:59.200
you grab it by the horns.
That's what I always sa--

10:59.284 --> 11:02.495
Say!

11:05.290 --> 11:09.085
My... my... my... my...

11:09.169 --> 11:11.421
It's nice 'n' bright 'n' sunny, isn't it?

11:11.504 --> 11:13.923
Ah-hyuck! Lots more roomier than before.

11:14.007 --> 11:16.926
Don't ya just love it, Pete? Ah-hyuck!

11:17.010 --> 11:19.429
My... my... my...

11:19.554 --> 11:21.973
Say, you're lookin'
kinda pale there, buddy.

11:22.057 --> 11:24.142
You got some kind of vitamin deficiency?

11:24.225 --> 11:26.895
Or maybe comin' down
with somethin' or somethin'.

11:26.978 --> 11:29.356
My... my... my...

11:29.439 --> 11:31.900
My house!

11:31.983 --> 11:34.778
Yep. Won't Peg be surprised?

11:34.861 --> 11:37.906
Peg! Oh, no! 3:00!

11:37.989 --> 11:39.449
She'll be here any minute now!

11:39.532 --> 11:41.618
I can't let her see it like this!

11:43.328 --> 11:45.955
You want it to be a surprise, do ya?

11:46.039 --> 11:47.999
Well, here she comes now.

11:48.124 --> 11:50.043
Just wait till she sees it.

11:50.126 --> 11:51.670
She'll be speechless.

11:51.753 --> 11:52.962
What?

11:54.422 --> 11:55.882
Hiya, Peg.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.300
Where's Pete?

11:57.384 --> 12:00.387
He's got a surprise for you.

12:02.514 --> 12:05.934
Oh. There you are, sweetums.

12:06.017 --> 12:07.560
I-- [coughs]

12:07.644 --> 12:09.396
'fraid I can't make the--

12:09.479 --> 12:11.356
[coughs] ...trip.

12:11.439 --> 12:12.941
Ah-choo!

12:13.024 --> 12:17.070
Doc says I got the Friday-to-Sunday flu.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.030
Boy, am I surprised.

12:19.155 --> 12:21.491
But-- but I am sick.

12:21.574 --> 12:22.909
See?

12:24.661 --> 12:27.080
Yep. He's been lookin' a few degrees

12:27.163 --> 12:29.374
this side of under
the weather, all righty.

12:29.499 --> 12:30.458
Really?

12:30.542 --> 12:32.502
Yeah. Just a minute ago,

12:32.585 --> 12:35.755
he turned all white
and broke into a cold sweat.

12:35.839 --> 12:38.341
Oh, well, you poor dear.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.510
I'm not leaving you here all alone.

12:40.593 --> 12:43.888
You're not? I mean, you're not

12:43.972 --> 12:45.807
because you can't let the kids down.

12:45.974 --> 12:48.685
Yeah. Now don't worry
about me. I'll be fine.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.937
I asked the goof here
if he'd take care of me.

12:51.021 --> 12:52.981
And he said, "Why, sure. Hyuck!"

12:53.064 --> 12:54.691
Ain't that right, Goofer?

12:54.774 --> 12:58.653
Well, no, but if you would have,
I'd have said yes.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.656
Well, I suppose we could go without you.

13:01.740 --> 13:03.575
Sure, you could. Ah-choo.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.994
Now if you take
the interstate over to vine--

13:06.077 --> 13:09.080
But first I'll set you up
a nice comfy spot on the couch

13:09.205 --> 13:10.999
And get you some aspirin and--

13:11.082 --> 13:14.878
No! I mean, you can't, puppy breath.

13:14.961 --> 13:18.631
You gotta pick up the kids
and get rollin'

13:18.715 --> 13:21.092
so you beat the rush-hour traffic.

13:21.176 --> 13:23.970
But there's no traffic in Spoonerville.

13:24.054 --> 13:25.930
Right. Not yet.

13:26.014 --> 13:28.350
But there's all those tract-house suburbs

13:28.433 --> 13:29.768
on the drawing board. [giggles]

13:29.851 --> 13:31.311
You never know when the bombs will hit.

13:31.394 --> 13:33.355
Gridlock from here to eternity.

13:36.191 --> 13:38.068
Bye, plum cake.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.820
See ya Sunday afternoon.

13:40.904 --> 13:42.614
That is when you're comin' home, isn't it?

13:42.739 --> 13:44.407
Yes, stubble cheeks.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.910
I'll see ya then. [coughs]

13:46.993 --> 13:48.370
Should be all cured by Sunday.

13:48.453 --> 13:50.038
Now you stay in bed.

13:50.121 --> 13:52.290
You know I will, sweet patootie.

13:52.415 --> 13:54.292
And you make sure he does.

13:54.376 --> 13:56.503
Okey-dokey, sweet patootie--

13:56.586 --> 13:57.921
I mean Peg.

13:58.046 --> 14:00.674
See that he stays warm,
drinks plenty of fluids,

14:00.757 --> 14:02.258
and gets a lot of rest.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.427
I'll get him in shipshape shape,

14:04.511 --> 14:08.306
or my name isn't, uh... "15% cotton."

14:08.431 --> 14:10.517
That's not it. It's...

14:10.600 --> 14:13.395
Good-bye, Pete. Bye-bye. Kiss, kiss.

14:13.478 --> 14:15.438
Good-bye, Goofy. Bye-bye. Miss you.

14:15.522 --> 14:18.358
Goofy. That's it. Ah-hyuck!

14:18.441 --> 14:19.984
[Pete] I thought you said

14:20.068 --> 14:22.195
you were gonna have it
finished by the weekend!

14:22.278 --> 14:24.406
You're gonna have my household back here

14:24.489 --> 14:26.074
first thing in the morning,

14:26.157 --> 14:28.785
or I'm personally comin' after ya!

14:28.910 --> 14:29.869
[panting]

14:30.120 --> 14:32.080
Petey, I brought you some blankets here.

14:32.163 --> 14:35.458
Gawrsh. I think you're runnin'
a fever there, Petey.

14:35.542 --> 14:36.668
I got to get you to bed

14:36.751 --> 14:38.795
so you can get some sleep.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.464
Sleep? Yeah, yeah.

14:41.548 --> 14:44.134
Maybe I need a little sleep.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.719
[snoring]

14:47.262 --> 14:48.680
Aw, look at him.

14:48.763 --> 14:51.474
He looks so... So Pete-ish.

14:51.558 --> 14:54.019
[muttering]

14:54.102 --> 14:56.813
I better make sure
he stays all warm 'n' cozy.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.898
[mutters]

15:01.776 --> 15:03.028
Unh! Unh!

15:03.111 --> 15:04.988
What the-- this? Hey.

15:08.324 --> 15:11.077
Aah!

15:11.953 --> 15:14.497
[Pete] Oh, where are those guys?

15:14.581 --> 15:17.375
Here ya go. Some nice hot
chicken soup.

15:17.459 --> 15:22.047
They shoulda been on the job
at a quarter past dawn.

15:22.130 --> 15:24.549
Oh, kitty, come and get it!

15:28.428 --> 15:30.889
[slurp] Hmm. Not bad.

15:30.972 --> 15:32.932
Tastes like ya left the livers in, too.

15:33.016 --> 15:35.185
[recorded female voice]
I'm sorry. The number you have reached

15:35.268 --> 15:37.437
is no longer in service.

15:37.520 --> 15:40.690
It can't be! They couldn't have...

15:43.651 --> 15:46.946
Ah-hyuck! I almost fed the cat some soup.

15:49.324 --> 15:51.451
Hmm? Hmm?

15:51.534 --> 15:53.620
-[retching]
-Pete, what's the matter?

15:53.703 --> 15:55.538
Get your keys, Goof.

15:55.622 --> 15:58.500
We're goin' for a little ride.

15:58.583 --> 16:01.586
Nope. Peg told me I got
to take good care of ya,

16:01.670 --> 16:03.254
and that's just what I'm gonna do.

16:03.338 --> 16:05.423
[muttering]

16:05.507 --> 16:07.967
But, uh, that was my doctor on the phone.

16:08.051 --> 16:11.930
Yeah. Says I got an acute
case of homesickness.

16:12.055 --> 16:14.849
Says as soon as I get my house back,
I'll be all cured up.

16:14.933 --> 16:17.268
-Naw.
-Yeah.

16:17.352 --> 16:20.063
But I gotta get it back
by tomorrow afternoon,

16:20.146 --> 16:25.985
or I'll be headin' for that
great used-car lot in the sky.

16:26.069 --> 16:29.572
Whoa! Then we gotta find them guys fast!

16:30.615 --> 16:32.075
Gawrsh.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.910
Beautiful place for a remodelin' business.

16:34.077 --> 16:36.371
Only I don't see any business.

16:36.454 --> 16:40.333
That's because there isn't any business

16:40.417 --> 16:43.503
on account of because I got conned

16:43.586 --> 16:46.589
by a couple of cons!

16:46.673 --> 16:49.676
[echoing] Cons! Cons! Cons...

16:52.721 --> 16:54.931
You're gonna be all right, Petey.

16:55.015 --> 16:57.851
The long arm of the law will
put the collar on them crooks

16:57.934 --> 16:59.352
and get your house back.

17:01.563 --> 17:02.897
So I tell you,

17:02.981 --> 17:04.566
this guy ends up loses his entire house.

17:04.649 --> 17:06.818
Nah. You're kidding, right?

17:06.901 --> 17:09.904
Crooks stole the house right from under
the guy's nose.

17:09.988 --> 17:11.906
[laughter]

17:11.990 --> 17:14.576
What kind of crazy nut would
let something like that happen?

17:14.659 --> 17:17.579
A dumb one, a real dumb one.

17:17.662 --> 17:19.080
[laughing]

17:19.164 --> 17:21.583
Ah-hyuck! Ah-hyuck! Ah-ha ha ha ha!

17:21.666 --> 17:24.044
That's a good one, all righty! Ah-hyuck!

17:24.127 --> 17:26.629
Kind of like exactly what happened to--

17:28.131 --> 17:30.884
[Pete] Now the whole town knows.

17:30.967 --> 17:33.553
If Peg finds out, I'm-- Peg!

17:33.636 --> 17:36.181
Goofer, you got to help me!
Time's runnin' out!

17:36.264 --> 17:38.266
Don't go talking like that, Pete.

17:38.350 --> 17:40.643
Maybe you need a second opinion.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.146
What I need is a house!

17:44.314 --> 17:45.565
You know,

17:45.648 --> 17:47.359
I saw somethin' in the paper

17:47.442 --> 17:49.611
that just might be
the answer to your problem.

17:49.694 --> 17:52.072
There's a place havin' a weekend special

17:52.155 --> 17:54.491
on used-house parts.

17:54.574 --> 17:57.160
Maybe we can find you somethin' here...

17:59.245 --> 18:00.997
Like maybe this kitchen.

18:01.164 --> 18:03.958
Hmm. You know,

18:04.042 --> 18:06.753
when the sun hits the dirt
just a certain way,

18:06.836 --> 18:11.174
it does kind of sort of
almost look slightly like my old kitchen.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.009
Well, lookie there. Ah-hyuck!

18:13.093 --> 18:14.678
Doesn't this take a liking

18:14.761 --> 18:16.179
to your little daughter Pistol's room?

18:16.262 --> 18:20.934
Yeah. Yeah! It does,
now that you mention it.

18:24.729 --> 18:27.357
Kind of reminds you of your
own bedroom, don't it?

18:27.440 --> 18:30.568
The similaritude is almost amazin'.

18:30.652 --> 18:33.863
Even has a fishin' cap
just like the one you had.

18:34.030 --> 18:38.118
Why, the semblance of a resemblance
is practically eerie.

18:38.201 --> 18:41.496
If I didn't know any better,
I'd think that this was--

18:41.579 --> 18:44.666
My fishin' cap! That was my fishin' cap!

18:44.749 --> 18:47.711
This-- this is my bedroom!

18:47.794 --> 18:50.922
And this-- this is my hall!

18:51.172 --> 18:52.382
And my garage!

18:54.384 --> 18:56.636
Well, well, well.

18:56.720 --> 18:59.180
Who have we here?

18:59.264 --> 19:00.306
You!

19:00.682 --> 19:04.769
Uh, boy, am I glad to see you.

19:04.853 --> 19:08.189
I'm givin' you home wreckers
one hour

19:08.273 --> 19:10.692
to put my house back together!

19:10.775 --> 19:14.904
Gee, I wish we could,
pal, but nope, we can't.

19:15.071 --> 19:16.156
What do you mean, you can't?

19:16.239 --> 19:18.908
I guess you missed the small print

19:18.992 --> 19:20.702
down here where it says

19:20.785 --> 19:25.373
"Any room we have ta move
we get salvage rights on."

19:25.457 --> 19:28.293
Right next to a place you signed

19:28.376 --> 19:31.171
with your own legally bindin' name.

19:31.254 --> 19:34.007
Of course, if you really want it back,

19:34.090 --> 19:38.094
I'm sure we could come to some agreement.

19:39.471 --> 19:41.598
[Pete] 52, 53, 54, 55, 56.

19:41.681 --> 19:47.103
There. That's $1,437.56, all I got.

19:47.187 --> 19:50.357
It's a pleasure doin' the business to ya.

19:50.440 --> 19:52.859
Forget it! Just put my
house back together.

19:52.942 --> 19:55.904
Sorry, pal. We don't build houses.

19:55.987 --> 19:58.907
We only remodel 'em.

20:00.367 --> 20:02.619
Hey! Hey! You get back here!

20:02.702 --> 20:04.746
You no-good, good for nothin'--

20:04.829 --> 20:05.955
[coughs]

20:06.039 --> 20:08.249
Peg's gonna be here soon.

20:08.333 --> 20:10.043
There ain't no way no how

20:10.126 --> 20:13.213
I'll ever get that house
back together in time!

20:13.296 --> 20:14.547
[sobbing]

20:14.631 --> 20:15.882
There's no hope, Goof!

20:15.965 --> 20:17.884
Aw, sure, there is, Pete.

20:17.967 --> 20:21.680
Look, the boys left these
architecky-type plans.

20:21.763 --> 20:23.640
But do you think we can do it?

20:23.723 --> 20:26.935
I never put a whole house
back together before.

20:27.018 --> 20:28.603
Aw, shucks, if you take half

20:28.687 --> 20:30.230
and I take the other third,

20:30.313 --> 20:33.566
we'll have it done as easy as 1-2-4.

20:33.650 --> 20:35.777
Move 'er up, Goof. Move 'er up.

20:37.070 --> 20:39.531
Back 'er up, Goof. Back 'er up.

20:41.866 --> 20:42.992
Ow!

20:46.079 --> 20:47.455
Ow!

20:50.166 --> 20:53.086
After a while, you just get used to it.

20:54.504 --> 20:56.923
Oh, I got to hand it to us, Goofer.

20:57.007 --> 21:00.093
We really pulled it off. Ha ha ha!

21:00.176 --> 21:03.054
Yeah, and just in time
for Peg and the kids to see.

21:10.353 --> 21:11.938
Ha ha. Perfecto.

21:12.022 --> 21:12.981
Goof! The picture.

21:13.356 --> 21:15.316
Uh, got it, Pete.

21:18.570 --> 21:22.282
