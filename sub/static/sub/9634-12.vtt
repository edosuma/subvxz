01:56.334 --> 01:59.625
[NARRATOR] Previously on Dragon
Ball, Emperor Pilaf succeeded in

01:59.709 --> 02:02.917
uniting the seven magic
Dragon Balls, and now prepares

02:03.000 --> 02:06.250
to summon the Eternal
Dragon to grant his wish

02:06.334 --> 02:08.500
to rule the world.

02:12.875 --> 02:14.459
Come forth, Dragon!

02:14.542 --> 02:17.125
I call upon you
to grant my wish!

02:20.625 --> 02:23.042
[NARRATOR] Little does the
Emperor know, two of our heroes

02:23.125 --> 02:26.792
have taken flight in an attempt
to thwart his diabolical plans.

02:27.334 --> 02:29.709
[PUAR] Come on, Oolong!
We have to hurry!

02:30.084 --> 02:31.750
[OOLONG] How fast do
you think a pig can fly?

02:32.250 --> 02:34.500
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, the rest
of the team watches helplessly

02:34.584 --> 02:38.209
from above, trapped within the
confines of their prison cell.

02:40.750 --> 02:43.834
C'mon, Puar!
You're our only hope now!

02:43.917 --> 02:45.584
You can do it, Oolong!

02:46.125 --> 02:47.250
[GOKU] What's
going on, you guys?!

02:47.334 --> 02:48.709
I can't see!

02:52.125 --> 02:54.292
Eternal Dragon!

02:58.625 --> 03:00.042
Arise!

03:20.959 --> 03:22.959
[NARRATOR] At last, the Eternal
Dragon has risen from its

03:23.042 --> 03:27.250
slumber within the fiery core of
the Earth. And It seems nothing

03:27.334 --> 03:29.209
can prevent Emperor
Pilaf from fulfilling

03:29.292 --> 03:31.209
his desire for world domination!

03:31.292 --> 03:33.042
[NARRATOR] Hurry, Oolong!
Hurry, Puar!

03:33.125 --> 03:35.917
The fate of the
world is in your hands!

03:48.709 --> 03:51.709
We're too late, Oolong.
The dragon's already here!

03:51.792 --> 03:53.375
Now what are we going to do?!

03:53.459 --> 03:55.542
We can't just stand
here and watch!

03:55.625 --> 03:57.709
Oh, we have no choice!

03:57.792 --> 03:59.417
Hey, let me see!

04:04.792 --> 04:06.542
I can't believe it...

04:06.625 --> 04:09.667
It's the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen!

04:16.041 --> 04:21.041
[PILAF] At last, my greatest
dreams are finally coming true!

04:21.125 --> 04:26.167
Soon the whole world
will be at my beck and call!

04:30.292 --> 04:34.000
[laughing]

04:37.250 --> 04:43.292
[cheering]

04:43.375 --> 04:53.334
[laughing]

04:53.417 --> 05:03.334
[laughing]

05:03.417 --> 05:10.459
[laughing]

05:16.334 --> 05:25.125
[whimpering]

05:25.209 --> 05:28.000
[GOKU] Wow, he's huge!

05:29.834 --> 05:32.459
[DRAGON] Who has summoned me?

05:32.542 --> 05:37.000
Uh, that would be me. I did.

05:37.084 --> 05:40.084
Tell me your wish.

05:40.167 --> 05:44.250
[DRAGON] But beware,
for it will come true.

05:48.709 --> 05:50.459
We've got to do something!

05:50.542 --> 05:52.959
We can't just let the
whole world go to ruin!

05:55.459 --> 05:56.834
[DRAGON] Speak!

05:57.459 --> 06:01.042
Do something, you stupid pig!

06:01.709 --> 06:03.084
I hope he ate already!

06:06.792 --> 06:09.167
Alright, then. I'm ready.

06:09.542 --> 06:12.959
Whoa, this is it guys!
He's about to make his wish!

06:13.334 --> 06:15.292
[YAMCHA] Now I'll
never get a date!

06:15.375 --> 06:16.750
[BULMA] My boyfriend!

06:17.500 --> 06:19.292
[PILAF] Uh, I wish for, uh...

06:20.000 --> 06:26.917
Ka-me-ha-me-ha!

06:28.709 --> 06:33.417
[GOKU] Darn, that didn't work!
Kamehamehas make me hungry...

06:33.500 --> 06:36.084
But, I'm not gonna give up yet!

06:36.542 --> 06:41.167
Ka-me-ha--!

06:41.250 --> 06:43.834
[DRAGON] You try my patience!

06:45.542 --> 06:47.042
I'm sorry!

06:47.125 --> 06:49.875
It just that I've
never done this before...

06:51.625 --> 06:52.959
[DRAGON] Make a wish!

06:53.667 --> 06:54.959
[DRAGON] Now!

06:56.417 --> 06:57.584
[PILAF] Yes, of course!

06:57.667 --> 06:59.917
[PILAF] My wish... how
silly of me... my wish!

07:00.334 --> 07:02.042
I'm a coward!
I don't want to be a hero!

07:02.125 --> 07:04.000
I don't want to save
the day! This stinks!

07:04.084 --> 07:06.459
And these boxers are chafing!

07:06.542 --> 07:09.459
Uh... I would
like to have supreme...

07:11.125 --> 07:14.250
...me-ha!

07:15.709 --> 07:18.250
I want to have the world--

07:18.334 --> 07:21.500
[OOLONG] The world's most
comfortable pair of ultra-soft--

07:21.584 --> 07:25.709
underwear!

07:51.917 --> 07:53.709
Huh?

07:53.792 --> 07:55.084
[snickering]

07:55.167 --> 07:57.584
I think that little
pervert just saved the world!

07:57.667 --> 08:00.584
Maybe he's not such
a coward after all!

08:01.459 --> 08:02.834
You dolt!

08:03.792 --> 08:07.584
[DRAGON] Your wish
has been granted.

08:28.125 --> 08:36.375
[whimpering]

08:36.458 --> 08:39.750
All of the Dragon
Balls just flew away!

08:39.833 --> 08:42.375
That's what happens when
the dragon grants a wish.

08:42.458 --> 08:44.667
The balls are spread
all over the earth again.

08:45.125 --> 08:48.084
What? That means the
Dragon Ball Grandpa gave me

08:48.167 --> 08:50.125
to remember him by is gone!

08:51.792 --> 08:53.084
[snickering]

08:53.167 --> 08:54.542
[PILAF] Seize him!

08:55.000 --> 08:57.084
I want that
pig for dinner!

09:01.542 --> 09:03.042
[PILAF] The others
have escaped too!

09:03.125 --> 09:04.209
I want them all!

09:04.292 --> 09:06.875
Exterminate! Exterminate!

09:06.959 --> 09:08.334
[OOLONG] Hey, let's go, Puar!

09:10.000 --> 09:11.292
We can take those two!

09:11.375 --> 09:15.917
[guns firing]

09:16.000 --> 09:17.375
Or not!

09:18.250 --> 09:19.292
Goku?!

09:19.375 --> 09:20.792
[BULMA] What are you doing?

09:20.875 --> 09:22.875
I'm too hungry
to go anywhere.

09:23.334 --> 09:25.125
[BULMA] You're too hungry?!

09:26.292 --> 09:28.000
You're gonna be too
dead to go anywhere if

09:28.084 --> 09:29.459
you don't move it! C'mon!

09:32.709 --> 09:35.000
Shu, they're heading
toward the north face!

09:35.084 --> 09:36.584
I'll call my dog police!

10:14.709 --> 10:17.000
We've gotta find
Yamcha and the others.

10:17.084 --> 10:18.792
You wanna find
those whiney goofballs,

10:18.875 --> 10:22.917
go right ahead. I've already
saved the world once today.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.584
I feel like I've
done my civic duty.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.292
You mean you're
just going to leave your

10:27.375 --> 10:28.917
two friends behind?!

10:34.750 --> 10:36.125
Let's get outta here!

10:41.084 --> 10:42.750
Try thinking
positive for a change!

10:42.834 --> 10:45.459
And run faster,
you're falling behind!

10:49.084 --> 10:50.042
Think positive, huh?!

10:50.125 --> 10:51.500
Fine, it doesn't work.

10:55.584 --> 10:57.750
Snap out of it, Goku!

10:57.834 --> 10:59.209
I'm too hungry...

10:59.834 --> 11:02.709
Here they come!

11:04.875 --> 11:05.917
[YAMCHA] Dinner time, Goku!

11:15.625 --> 11:16.375
Yum-yum!

11:29.792 --> 11:32.709
Looks like I'm
on clean-up duty.

11:35.667 --> 11:37.584
Wolf Fang Fist!

11:46.459 --> 11:47.542
C'mon!

11:47.625 --> 11:48.792
Let's get out of
this stinkin' dog kennel!

12:29.375 --> 12:30.334
Power Pole, extend!

12:43.792 --> 12:45.667
They're... they're...
they're gaining on us!

12:45.750 --> 12:48.334
Don't worry, I'm
an expert at running away!

12:52.250 --> 12:53.875
Power Pole, extend!

12:56.792 --> 12:58.584
All right, so
maybe it wasn't graceful, but

12:58.667 --> 13:00.750
at least I got us
away from the dogs.

13:00.834 --> 13:02.167
You know, we could
just change into

13:02.250 --> 13:03.667
birds and fly out of here.

13:07.292 --> 13:09.000
This is just great, Goku!

13:09.084 --> 13:12.084
So how do you think we're going
to get over to that window, huh?

13:12.167 --> 13:12.834
I dunno.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.042
Now he tells us!

13:16.792 --> 13:17.375
You ready, Puar?

13:17.459 --> 13:18.834
Okay, let's go!

13:21.459 --> 13:27.959
[screaming]

13:30.834 --> 13:32.917
Ow, now that smarts!

13:33.250 --> 13:34.292
Oh, great, more dogs!

13:40.292 --> 13:41.750
I need some food, bad.

13:44.292 --> 13:45.542
[MAI and SHU] Attack!

13:48.375 --> 13:49.334
[SHU] Alright, drop that mutt!

13:52.417 --> 13:53.209
[BULMA] Yamcha?

13:57.625 --> 13:59.542
[growling]

13:59.625 --> 14:11.042
[maniacal laughter]

14:22.375 --> 14:24.875
I bet even Goku can't
blast a hole this time!

14:24.959 --> 14:26.625
It's made of some weird metal.

14:27.042 --> 14:31.167
No big deal. Look!
There's no ceiling!

14:32.584 --> 14:35.667
Yes there is.
It's probably made of glass.

14:35.750 --> 14:38.125
It can't be
harder than my head.

14:38.209 --> 14:39.584
Just watch this!

14:49.375 --> 14:51.667
And from the looks
of it--tempered glass.

14:55.334 --> 14:57.667
Well, I'm not giving up.
First, we're gonna get out

14:57.750 --> 15:00.917
of here, then we're gonna find
all seven Dragon Balls again.

15:02.209 --> 15:05.000
There won't be any
Dragon Balls for a year.

15:05.084 --> 15:06.459
What do you mean?!

15:06.834 --> 15:08.750
Yeah, what gives?

15:08.834 --> 15:12.625
It's all part of the legend.
Once the Eternal Dragon grants

15:12.709 --> 15:15.334
a wish and the Dragon
Balls are scattered across the

15:15.417 --> 15:18.750
earth again, they become inert
for a full year. In other words,

15:18.834 --> 15:21.042
you won't even be able to
tell they're Dragon Balls.

15:21.125 --> 15:23.084
They'll just look
like round stones...

15:23.667 --> 15:26.500
Are... are you... serious?

15:26.584 --> 15:28.250
Yikes, that's harsh.

15:29.375 --> 15:30.667
I can't believe it...

15:30.750 --> 15:33.959
Now I have to be shy
around women for another year!

15:34.042 --> 15:36.750
[BULMA] And I have to wait
another year for a boyfriend...

15:38.000 --> 15:41.709
[PILAF] Is this on? I wouldn't
worry your pretty, little heads

15:41.792 --> 15:44.625
over what's going to
happen a year from now!

15:44.709 --> 15:48.875
You're all going to
be terminated tomorrow!

15:48.959 --> 15:50.750
I hope you're enjoying
your accommodations because

15:50.834 --> 15:54.459
I personally designed
the cell you're in! I call

15:54.542 --> 15:56.625
it my Easy Bake Office!

15:56.709 --> 15:59.959
[PILAF] I wanted to see how hot
I could make a room by absorbing

16:00.042 --> 16:01.500
all of the sun's rays!

16:01.584 --> 16:04.417
It's pleasant in there now,
but just wait until the sun

16:04.500 --> 16:10.084
comes up! Then,
get ready to broil!

16:10.167 --> 16:14.834
I'm going to roast you alive
and enjoy every minute of it!

16:15.875 --> 16:16.834
That fiend!

16:16.917 --> 16:18.500
We've got to get out of here!

16:19.292 --> 16:21.334
Oh, now my skin's
gonna dry up,

16:21.417 --> 16:23.209
and I'm gonna get
premature wrinkles!

16:23.292 --> 16:25.834
At least you'll die with a tan!

16:25.917 --> 16:29.084
Oh, yeah, that's right.
I'll be dead!

16:29.167 --> 16:32.334
I don't wanna die,
I'm too young!

16:32.417 --> 16:33.792
I am, too!

16:33.875 --> 16:36.209
[wailing]

16:36.292 --> 16:37.875
I can't die now!

16:39.375 --> 16:40.750
Oh no, oh no, oh no!

16:40.834 --> 16:42.250
I'm hungry.

16:42.334 --> 16:44.084
[PILAF] They kind of remind
me of those little goldfish

16:44.167 --> 16:46.959
I used to have.
And they'll die just as quickly.

16:47.750 --> 16:50.084
[blows landing]

16:50.167 --> 16:53.875
[GOKU] Ka-me-ha-me-ha!

16:56.500 --> 16:58.209
[GOKU] Ha!

16:58.875 --> 17:01.125
--Come on you guys!
--You can do it!

17:03.667 --> 17:07.459
That's right, struggle! Do you
two idiots really think you

17:07.541 --> 17:12.291
can break through three solid
feet of my super-special steel?!

17:15.041 --> 17:19.084
He's right, it's not gonna work.
We're stuck here.

17:19.166 --> 17:22.916
Sleep well, and I'll wake
you up early for toast!

17:23.000 --> 17:26.584
[laughing]

17:32.459 --> 17:34.000
[SHU] Carefully, sire.

17:34.084 --> 17:37.542
[PILAF] Ahh, there.
That's it, see?

17:37.625 --> 17:40.459
Sometimes it's the small
accomplishments in life that

17:40.542 --> 17:42.334
--have to suffice.
--[SHU] So true.

17:42.417 --> 17:44.417
Of course, if it wasn't
for those kids, I'd be

17:44.500 --> 17:46.709
ruling the world right now!

17:52.125 --> 17:55.375
But come sunrise,
they'll all be french-fried!

18:01.750 --> 18:03.167
Uh?

18:10.750 --> 18:13.125
You think he'd at least
give us a last request...

18:13.209 --> 18:15.250
Well, I have a last request!

18:15.334 --> 18:17.625
Oolong, will you
please shut up?!

18:18.000 --> 18:19.959
Request denied, glamour girl!

18:20.042 --> 18:21.375
[PUAR] Ohh...

18:27.709 --> 18:30.834
[OOLONG] Hey, Puar,
what are you doing up there?

18:30.917 --> 18:32.917
Nothing, just watching the moon.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.250
How can you watch the moon?

18:34.334 --> 18:36.792
Aren't you
worried about tomorrow?!

18:36.875 --> 18:38.792
Yeah, but that's why
I'm looking at the moon:

18:38.875 --> 18:42.334
It's soothing. Look
how full it is tonight.

18:42.417 --> 18:44.917
Doesn't it make you
feel all warm and fuzzy?

18:45.000 --> 18:47.042
I'm a pig,
I am warm and fuzzy!

18:49.084 --> 18:50.792
A full moon?

18:51.750 --> 18:53.792
Did you guys know that
a terrible monster comes

18:53.875 --> 18:56.125
out when the moon is full?

18:56.209 --> 18:58.209
Oh, come on Goku,
you're making that up!

18:58.292 --> 19:01.042
There's no such thing. You
should put that imagination

19:01.125 --> 19:04.667
to better use and figure out
a way to get us out of here!

19:04.750 --> 19:06.375
But I'm not making it up,
Bulma!

19:06.459 --> 19:09.834
My Grandpa was trampled
to death by that monster!

19:09.917 --> 19:13.584
What? Gohan, the
supreme martial arts master?

19:13.667 --> 19:16.709
That's gotta be one
big, savage monster.

19:16.792 --> 19:18.125
Yeah.

19:18.209 --> 19:20.584
It destroyed our house
and crushed all of our trees.

19:21.167 --> 19:22.875
[OOLONG] What did
it look like, Goku?

19:22.959 --> 19:25.667
I'm not really sure,
I slept through the whole thing.

19:25.750 --> 19:27.875
[OOLONG] What? How could you
sleep if a huge monster was

19:27.959 --> 19:30.667
fighting your grandpa
and wrecking your house?

19:30.750 --> 19:32.500
[GOKU] I don't know.
The last thing I remember was

19:32.584 --> 19:35.292
Grandpa warning me about the
full moon and how I should

19:35.375 --> 19:39.750
never, ever look at it.
Of course, that didn't have

19:39.834 --> 19:42.250
anything to do with the
monster. Grandpa was always

19:42.334 --> 19:44.625
saying these really strange
things, and every--

19:45.542 --> 19:46.959
[GOKU] Hey, what
are you guys doing?

19:47.042 --> 19:48.375
Oh, nothing.

19:48.459 --> 19:49.709
Hey, Goku?

19:49.792 --> 19:51.875
Can I ask you a
little something?

19:51.959 --> 19:53.292
Sure.

19:53.375 --> 19:55.167
[BULMA] The night your
grandfather was killed, did you

19:55.250 --> 19:57.750
happen to look at the full moon?

19:57.834 --> 20:03.459
[GOKU] Well. I think I did.
Just before I fell asleep. Why?

20:03.875 --> 20:05.417
I'm getting a
little nervous...

20:05.500 --> 20:07.459
You're not the only one...

20:07.542 --> 20:09.792
I had a feeling that
Goku wasn't just an ordinary

20:09.875 --> 20:13.209
kid, I think I was right.

20:13.292 --> 20:15.250
I'm at a loss here,
Yamcha.

20:15.334 --> 20:17.417
How do we find out for sure?

20:17.500 --> 20:19.959
How do you find
out what for sure?

20:20.042 --> 20:21.875
I guess we could make
him look at the moon,

20:21.959 --> 20:23.542
then there wouldn't
be any doubts at all!

20:23.625 --> 20:24.750
That's true...

20:24.834 --> 20:26.834
But what if he...

20:26.917 --> 20:29.834
What if he does
turn into a monster?

20:29.917 --> 20:32.459
We'd end up just
like his grandpa!

20:32.542 --> 20:35.584
Yeah, that'd be a lot of fun.

20:35.667 --> 20:39.209
Let's not chance it.
It's far too dangerous.

20:39.292 --> 20:40.959
I'm with you!

20:41.042 --> 20:43.667
Goku, be very careful
not to look at the moon!

20:43.750 --> 20:45.125
[BULMA] It's right above you!

20:45.209 --> 20:46.584
[GOKU] Huh?

20:49.209 --> 20:50.584
Huh.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.667
[GOKU] I don't see what
the big deal is?

20:55.875 --> 20:58.167
Are you okay, Goku?

20:58.250 --> 20:59.625
Of course I am!

21:00.417 --> 21:02.250
You had us
scared there, kid!

21:02.334 --> 21:03.292
Phew!

21:03.375 --> 21:04.959
I knew it was
just a coincidence.

21:15.792 --> 21:18.292
I'd suggest we run,
but I wouldn't know where!

21:18.375 --> 21:21.167
Goku, stop it,
this isn't funny!

21:21.792 --> 21:23.209
[YAMCHA] I don't
think he's joking!

21:27.792 --> 21:35.459
[growling]

21:35.542 --> 21:49.209
[screaming]

21:49.292 --> 21:53.250
[roaring]

21:53.334 --> 21:56.584
[screaming]

21:56.667 --> 22:00.459
[rumbling]

22:00.542 --> 22:03.500
[roaring]

22:03.584 --> 22:06.167
[SHU] Oh, I hate it when
Pilaf starts snoring like this.

22:06.250 --> 22:07.792
[MAI] It feels
like an earthquake.

22:07.875 --> 22:09.334
[SHU] That's ridiculous!

22:13.792 --> 22:17.750
[APE GOKU roaring]

22:17.834 --> 22:20.334
[NARRATOR] Will Goku
return to his normal self?

22:20.417 --> 22:23.250
Or will he unknowingly be
responsible for the destruction

22:23.334 --> 22:26.042
of Bulma, Yamcha, and
the others? Find out next

22:26.125 --> 22:28.459
time, on Dragon Ball!

22:30.250 --> 22:33.000
