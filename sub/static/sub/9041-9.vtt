WEBVTT

00:01.900 --> 00:03.000
- SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE, MOM.

00:03.000 --> 00:04.800
- OH, ME TOO.

00:04.800 --> 00:06.200
- I JUST THINK IT'S GREAT THAT
YOU AND DAD ARE BOTH COMING

00:06.200 --> 00:07.500
FOR THANKSGIVING.

00:07.500 --> 00:09.033
IT REALLY MEANS A LOT TO ME.

00:09.033 --> 00:11.333
- [moaning]

00:11.333 --> 00:13.267
OH!

00:15.933 --> 00:18.467
WHOO.

00:18.467 --> 00:20.033
WITH THE KNEES.
LIFT WITH THE KNEES.

00:20.033 --> 00:22.033
[grunts]

00:22.033 --> 00:23.167
WHOO.

00:23.167 --> 00:25.100
- THANK YOU, RAYMOND.

00:25.100 --> 00:28.700
- MY PLEASURE...
THERE...

00:28.700 --> 00:31.467
YOU.

00:31.467 --> 00:32.600
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.067
- WAIT, RAY, THERE'S SOMETHING

00:34.067 --> 00:36.200
I KIND OF WANT TO TELL YOU BOTH.

00:36.200 --> 00:38.500
- WELL, YOU--
DEB, YOU CAN TELL ME LATER.

00:38.500 --> 00:39.567
- RAY.

00:39.567 --> 00:41.000
- BUT I'D LOVE TO HEAR IT
NOW TOO.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.333
THAT'S COOL.

00:43.333 --> 00:46.467
- YOU KNOW YOUR FATHER AND I
HAVE GOTTEN ALONG VERY WELL

00:46.467 --> 00:50.400
SINCE THE DIVORCE, AND WE TALK
A COUPLE OF TIMES A WEEK,

00:50.400 --> 00:53.633
AND, WELL, I JUST WANTED
TO LET YOU KNOW

00:53.633 --> 00:55.800
THAT YOUR FATHER'S
GOING TO BRING A FRIEND

00:55.800 --> 00:58.533
TO THANKSGIVING.

00:58.533 --> 01:01.800
- WHAT?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

01:01.800 --> 01:03.933
- I THINK IT'S A WOMAN FR--

01:03.933 --> 01:07.667
- I GOT THAT, RAY.

01:07.667 --> 01:09.467
- YES, BUT REALLY,
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

01:09.467 --> 01:11.967
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
HE'S GONNA BRING A WOMAN?

01:11.967 --> 01:14.267
A DATE?
HE'S BRINGING A DATE?

01:14.267 --> 01:16.700
OH, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

01:16.700 --> 01:20.100
- I GUESS BE HAPPY
THAT IT IS A WOMAN, RIGHT?

01:27.833 --> 01:29.800
- MOM, THIS IS NOT RIGHT.

01:29.800 --> 01:31.233
HER COMING OVER HERE WITH DAD,

01:31.233 --> 01:32.800
SITTING ACROSS THE TABLE
FROM YOU...

01:32.800 --> 01:36.200
IT'S JUST--IT'S GOT TO BE
TOO WEIRD FOR YOU.

01:36.200 --> 01:37.800
- NO, DEBRA, IT WON'T BE.

01:37.800 --> 01:39.967
WE TALKED ABOUT IT,
AND, REALLY, I'M FINE.

01:39.967 --> 01:41.433
- I DON'T LIKE THIS AT ALL.

01:41.433 --> 01:42.500
- ALL RIGHT, COME ON, MA.

01:42.500 --> 01:44.500
- NO. MARIE, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

01:44.500 --> 01:46.300
- WELL, BRINGING SOME GIRL,
SOME FLOOZY,

01:46.300 --> 01:47.700
TO DINNER
WITH HIS EX-WIFE--

01:47.700 --> 01:49.300
IT'S UNCOUTH.

01:49.300 --> 01:52.200
- OH, I DON'T THINK
SHE'S A FLOOZY, MARIE.

01:52.200 --> 01:53.700
- THEN WHY DATE HER?

01:59.367 --> 02:02.167
- I MEAN, HOW CAN HE ALREADY
HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?

02:02.167 --> 02:03.933
YOU'VE ONLY BEEN APART
EIGHT MONTHS.

02:03.933 --> 02:06.200
- YEAH, IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
- THANK YOU, ROBERT.

02:06.200 --> 02:08.100
- HOW COME I CAN'T FIND
A GIRLFRIEND?

02:10.400 --> 02:12.933
- YOU KNOW, MOM,
I JUST DON'T THINK THAT YOU--

02:12.933 --> 02:15.600
- DEB, DEB, DEB, I THINK
IF YOUR MOM'S OKAY WITH IT,

02:15.600 --> 02:18.167
ISN'T THAT WHAT'S IMPORTANT?

02:20.867 --> 02:26.267
- HONEY, YOU KNOW I STILL CARE
FOR YOUR FATHER VERY MUCH,

02:26.267 --> 02:28.233
AND IF THIS GIRL
IS WHAT HE NEEDS

02:28.233 --> 02:30.833
TO FEEL BETTER ABOUT HIMSELF,
FEEL YOUNGER,

02:30.833 --> 02:33.667
I SAY GOOD FOR HIM.

02:33.667 --> 02:34.967
OKAY?

02:34.967 --> 02:37.800
- I GUESS. YEAH.

02:37.800 --> 02:40.200
- OKAY.
GOOD, GOOD.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.767
AND WHO KNOWS?

02:41.767 --> 02:44.233
SOON I JUST MAY BE
OUT THERE LOOKING

02:44.233 --> 02:47.533
FOR AN ELIGIBLE YOUNGER MAN
MYSELF.

02:47.533 --> 02:50.467
[laughs]

02:57.867 --> 02:58.900
- HEY, GREAT JOB TODAY.

02:58.900 --> 03:00.033
- WHAT?

03:00.033 --> 03:01.967
WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?

03:01.967 --> 03:04.633
- "IF YOUR MOM'S OKAY WITH IT,
THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT."

03:04.633 --> 03:06.100
- WHAT?

03:06.100 --> 03:07.733
- THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID TODAY.

03:07.733 --> 03:11.533
- OH, YEAH. RIGHT.

03:11.533 --> 03:12.533
GOOD NIGHT.

03:14.267 --> 03:15.300
- SHE'S NOT OKAY.

03:15.300 --> 03:17.300
SHE HAD TO ACT THAT WAY

03:17.300 --> 03:19.400
BECAUSE YOUR WHOLE FAMILY
WAS THERE STARING AT HER.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.633
WHAT WAS SHE SUPPOSED TO DO?

03:20.633 --> 03:22.567
MY PARENTS WERE TOGETHER
FOR 41 YEARS,

03:22.567 --> 03:23.567
AND NOW MY FATHER

03:23.567 --> 03:25.133
HAS TO GO FIND
SOME LITTLE CHIPPY

03:25.133 --> 03:26.633
WHO MAKES HIM FEEL
LIKE HE'S STILL GOT IT.

03:26.633 --> 03:30.033
TRUST ME,
THIS IS PAINFUL FOR HER.

03:30.033 --> 03:31.800
- I GUESS, BUT...

03:31.800 --> 03:33.400
I GOTTA TELL YA.

03:33.400 --> 03:34.933
SOUNDS TO ME LIKE MAYBE--

03:34.933 --> 03:37.567
MAYBE YOU'RE NOT SO OKAY
WITH IT.

03:37.567 --> 03:39.533
- OH, YOU PICKIN' UP ON THAT,
EINSTEIN?

03:43.000 --> 03:44.933
- I WISH I WAS EINSTEIN,

03:44.933 --> 03:46.500
'CAUSE THEN I'D INVENT
A TIME MACHINE

03:46.500 --> 03:48.667
AND GO BACK
TO WHEN YOU WERE NICE.

03:57.767 --> 04:01.367
BOO.

04:01.367 --> 04:04.667
- BOO.
- STOP IT.

04:04.667 --> 04:05.767
- BOO.

04:05.767 --> 04:07.433
OW, OW, OW, OW, OW!

04:10.300 --> 04:11.933
COME ON. WHAT?
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

04:11.933 --> 04:13.467
- OH, NOTHING.

04:13.467 --> 04:15.533
YOU'VE NEVER PAID ANY ATTENTION
TO MY MOTHER BEFORE.

04:15.533 --> 04:17.433
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO START NOW.

04:17.433 --> 04:18.767
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?
I PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR MOM.

04:18.767 --> 04:20.400
- YOU DON'T EVEN CALL HER
ANYTHING.

04:20.400 --> 04:22.600
YOU JUST GRUNT AT HER.

04:22.600 --> 04:24.367
"HOW ARE YOU TODAY,
RAYMOND?"

04:24.367 --> 04:27.433
"UHH."

04:29.000 --> 04:30.533
[knock on door]

04:30.533 --> 04:32.133
YEAH, COME IN.

04:32.133 --> 04:33.633
- GOOD NIGHT, YOU TWO.

04:33.633 --> 04:34.767
- OKAY, GOOD NIGHT, MOM.

04:34.767 --> 04:35.967
- YES, PLEASANT DREAMS

04:35.967 --> 04:37.733
AND HAVE A HAPPY TOMORROW,
MILADY.

04:46.700 --> 04:49.133
- RAY, I'VE PUT ALMONDS
WITH THE GREEN BEANS.

04:49.133 --> 04:51.800
I REMEMBER YOU LIKED THEM
THAT WAY.

04:51.800 --> 04:54.300
- OH, YEAH. THANKS.

04:54.300 --> 04:56.233
YOU HAVE NICE HAIR.

04:59.033 --> 05:00.467
- THANK YOU.

05:00.467 --> 05:03.433
- THANK YOU
FOR NOT WEARING A HAT.

05:08.700 --> 05:11.400
- SO, RAY, YOU GONNA LET WARREN
AND HIS GIRLFRIEND

05:11.400 --> 05:12.600
SLEEP IN THE SAME BED, HUH?

05:12.600 --> 05:13.600
- ALL RIGHT.

05:13.600 --> 05:16.033
- HEY, WHAT IF THOSE TWO
GET MARRIED?

05:16.033 --> 05:18.067
OH, AND HAVE A KID?

05:18.067 --> 05:21.267
- AH. THAT'D BE AWKWARD.

05:21.267 --> 05:23.167
LET'S SEE.
DEBRA ALREADY HAS A SISTER.

05:23.167 --> 05:26.233
MAYBE A BROTHER THIS TIME, HUH?

05:26.233 --> 05:29.533
YOU CAN BURP AND CHANGE
YOUR OWN BROTHER-IN-LAW.

05:29.533 --> 05:31.667
- SHUT UP.

05:31.667 --> 05:32.700
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.067
[doorbell rings]

05:34.067 --> 05:35.700
THAT MUST BE THEM.

05:35.700 --> 05:37.700
COME ON!

05:37.700 --> 05:38.733
- SAY "EXCUSE ME," HUH?

05:40.933 --> 05:43.833
- HEY, THERE'S MY GUY RAYMOND!

05:43.833 --> 05:45.233
- HEY.

05:45.233 --> 05:47.200
- HA HA HA.
HELLO, HELLO.

05:47.200 --> 05:49.067
EVERYBODY,
I WANT YOU TO MEET EMMA.

05:49.067 --> 05:50.667
- HELLO.

05:55.333 --> 05:57.067
- HI.
- HI.

05:57.067 --> 05:58.500
- HELLO.
- HI.

06:04.033 --> 06:06.200
- NO BROTHER FOR DEBRA.

06:11.433 --> 06:13.867
- WELCOME.
WE'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU.

06:13.867 --> 06:16.367
- WELL, NOT YOU, EXACTLY.

06:20.200 --> 06:21.533
- THIS IS LOIS,

06:21.533 --> 06:23.333
THE WOMAN I'VE TOLD YOU
SO MUCH ABOUT.

06:23.333 --> 06:25.567
- I'M SO HAPPY
TO FINALLY MEET YOU.

06:25.567 --> 06:27.733
AND RAY...

06:27.733 --> 06:29.300
- HI.
- AND ROBERT...

06:29.300 --> 06:30.733
- [shouting]
HELLO!

06:30.733 --> 06:33.633
HOW ARE YOU?

06:43.000 --> 06:45.300
- MARIE AND FRANK...

06:45.300 --> 06:47.700
- IT'S A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU, EMMA,

06:47.700 --> 06:50.133
AND THAT'S
A LOVELY PANTSUIT.

06:50.133 --> 06:51.767
- OH, THIS OLD THING?

06:51.767 --> 06:53.467
- [chuckles]

06:55.367 --> 06:57.433
- AND THIS IS MY DAUGHTER DEBRA.
HI, SWEETHEART.

06:57.433 --> 06:58.867
- DAD.

06:58.867 --> 07:02.200
- IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU, DEBRA.
I BAKED THIS PIE FOR YOU.

07:02.200 --> 07:04.067
- OH, THANK YOU.
IT LOOKS DELICIOUS.

07:04.067 --> 07:06.000
- IT'S AN OLD FAMILY RECIPE.

07:08.667 --> 07:11.133
- SO YOU WORK
AT WARREN'S OFFICE?

07:11.133 --> 07:13.233
- YES. I WAS ALL SET
TO RETIRE LAST YEAR,

07:13.233 --> 07:15.900
BUT I DECIDED
I WASN'T READY.

07:15.900 --> 07:17.267
- YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY--

07:17.267 --> 07:19.900
"YOU'RE ONLY AS OLD
AS YOU FEEL."

07:19.900 --> 07:22.100
- THEN I'M NOT A DAY OVER 21!

07:22.100 --> 07:23.167
- THERE YOU GO.

07:23.167 --> 07:26.000
- GOOD FOR YOU.
- HA HA HA!

07:30.900 --> 07:32.867
- SO, DEB,
WHERE ARE MY GRANDKIDS?

07:32.867 --> 07:34.633
- OH, WELL, ALLY'S
WITH A FRIEND RIGHT NOW,

07:34.633 --> 07:36.167
AND THE TWINS
ARE TAKING A NAP.

07:36.167 --> 07:38.467
WE LET THEM STAY UP LATE
WITH GRANDMA LAST NIGHT.

07:38.467 --> 07:40.200
- OH, YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,
AFTER OUR DRIVE,

07:40.200 --> 07:41.767
I'M A BIT TUCKERED OUT
MYSELF.

07:41.767 --> 07:43.167
- DO YOU WANT TO LIE DOWN?

07:43.167 --> 07:44.767
- WOULD THAT BE
ALL RIGHT?

07:44.767 --> 07:46.900
- UH, SURE, SURE.
I'LL TAKE YOU UP.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.167
- I CAN DO IT, DEB.
UH, ALLY'S ROOM OKAY?

07:49.167 --> 07:51.233
- YEP, GREAT.

07:51.233 --> 07:53.500
- THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME
TO YOUR HOME.

07:53.500 --> 07:56.500
- I'M SO HAPPY TO BE SPENDING
THANKSGIVING WITH YOU ALL.

07:56.500 --> 07:58.700
- WELL, SURE.
THAT'S...YEAH.

07:58.700 --> 08:00.300
- THE MORE THE MERRIER.

08:27.833 --> 08:31.033
- HAPPY NEW YEAR!

08:37.633 --> 08:38.867
- I LIKE HER.

08:38.867 --> 08:40.267
SHE SEEMS VERY PLEASANT.

08:40.267 --> 08:42.067
- OH, VERY PLEASANT.
YEAH, SHE'S GREAT.

08:42.067 --> 08:44.500
- YEAH. YEAH, IT'S GOOD,
'CAUSE WE ALL THOUGHT WARREN

08:44.500 --> 08:46.067
WAS GONNA GO
FOR SOMEONE YOUNGER,

08:46.067 --> 08:48.533
BUT IT TURNS OUT HE'S JUST GOING
FOR SOMEONE DIFFERENT.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.433
OH, I--I MISSPOKE.

08:57.433 --> 08:59.467
I...IT'S THE OPPOSITE
OF WHAT I SAID.

08:59.467 --> 09:01.967
I DO THAT.
I DO THAT A LOT.

09:01.967 --> 09:03.667
LAST WEEK I SAID,

09:03.667 --> 09:06.067
"I'M DINNER.
WHAT'S FOR HUNGRY?"

09:06.067 --> 09:09.100
YEAH. AND THEN I--
THEN I ASKED HER

09:09.100 --> 09:11.133
IF THE CLEANERS WERE BACK
FROM MY PANTS.

09:11.133 --> 09:13.333
HA HA HA HA.

09:13.333 --> 09:16.433
- IT'S LIKE WATCHING
A CAR ACCIDENT.

09:20.500 --> 09:23.133
- I THINK I'M GOING TO GO
FOR A WALK.

09:23.133 --> 09:25.033
IF YOU COULD
JUST TELL WARREN,

09:25.033 --> 09:27.400
AND I'LL BE BACK
IN A LITTLE WHILE.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.233
- UH, I'LL GO WITH YOU, MOM.

09:29.233 --> 09:30.800
- I'LL COME, TOO.

09:30.800 --> 09:33.000
Raymond:
ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.300
YOU GUYS HAVE A GOOD TIME.
WE'LL JUST BE HERE--

09:37.700 --> 09:41.300
OKAY.

09:41.300 --> 09:43.667
- KILL IS GOING TO DEBRA YOU.

09:50.233 --> 09:52.233
- OH, GOD. OHH.

09:52.233 --> 09:53.967
- WHY DO YOU SAY THINGS?

09:53.967 --> 09:56.333
- BECAU--DEBRA WANTED ME
TO BE SUPPORTIVE

09:56.333 --> 09:57.833
OF HER MOTHER OR SOMETHING.

09:57.833 --> 09:59.533
I DON'T KNOW.

09:59.533 --> 10:02.667
- TRYIN' TO PLEASE THE WIFE.
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA LEARN?

10:06.133 --> 10:07.333
- WHERE ARE ALL THE LADIES?

10:07.333 --> 10:08.467
- OH, UH, THEY WENT
FOR A WALK.

10:08.467 --> 10:11.933
- TO GET AWAY FROM RAYMOND.

10:11.933 --> 10:13.567
- SO, HOW'S EVERYBODY BEEN?

10:13.567 --> 10:14.633
- GOOD. GOOD.

10:14.633 --> 10:16.600
YEAH, EMMA SEEMS NICE.

10:16.600 --> 10:21.467
- A FINE WOMAN. GENTEEL.

10:21.467 --> 10:24.833
- OH, YEAH,
SHE'S REALLY TERRIFIC.

10:24.833 --> 10:27.767
- MAY I ASK ONE QUESTION?

10:27.767 --> 10:29.500
- OF COURSE, FRANK.

10:29.500 --> 10:31.000
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

10:31.000 --> 10:32.833
- DAD. DAD!

10:32.833 --> 10:34.900
- NO, I MEAN--I MEAN,
SHE SEEMS NICE AND ALL,

10:34.900 --> 10:36.167
BUT JEEZALOO!

10:36.167 --> 10:40.700
YOU GOT
A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY HERE.

10:40.700 --> 10:42.733
YOU'RE STILL HANDSOME,
NICE TAN.

10:42.733 --> 10:46.467
YOU GOT ALL YOUR TEETH
AND THEN SOME.

10:49.133 --> 10:50.700
WHAT GIVES?

10:50.700 --> 10:51.667
- DAD, STOP.

10:51.667 --> 10:54.433
I MEAN, RIGHT? JEEZ.

10:54.433 --> 10:56.400
- ACTUALLY, WHAT IS
THE THOUGHT PROCESS HERE?

10:58.967 --> 11:02.333
- OKAY, YEAH, EMMA IS
A LITTLE BIT OLDER THAN ME,

11:02.333 --> 11:03.667
BUT I GOTTA TELL YOU, GUYS,

11:03.667 --> 11:08.100
IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT LOOKS
AND SEX FOR ME.

11:08.100 --> 11:11.400
- OKAY, BUT...IS ANY OF IT?

11:19.533 --> 11:22.300
- EMMA IS WARM AND FUNNY
AND CHARMING.

11:22.300 --> 11:24.800
I SIMPLY ADORE HER COMPANY,

11:24.800 --> 11:27.900
AND, UH,
CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING

11:27.900 --> 11:30.100
ABOUT DATING AN OLDER WOMAN?

11:30.100 --> 11:33.233
- THAT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

11:35.167 --> 11:36.800
- SHE APPRECIATES ME.

11:36.800 --> 11:40.533
WHEN I'M WITH HER,
I'M THE YOUNG BUCK.

11:40.533 --> 11:45.400
I FEEL MORE HIP
AND ENERGETIC NOW

11:45.400 --> 11:47.633
THAN ANY TIME
IN MY MARRIAGE.

11:50.067 --> 11:53.733
- INTERESTING.

11:57.600 --> 12:00.433
- I'M TRYING TO PICTURE MYSELF
WITH A WOMAN WHO'S OLDER.

12:00.433 --> 12:04.633
SHE'D HAVE TO BE
LIKE A MUMMY OR SOMETHING.

12:10.433 --> 12:12.567
- FRANK--

12:12.567 --> 12:13.533
- I WAS KIDDING!

12:17.700 --> 12:19.333
- I WANNA TALK TO YOU.

12:19.333 --> 12:20.867
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING
FOR A WALK.

12:20.867 --> 12:22.200
- RAY.
- HI, PUMPKIN.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.300
- ROBERT, DAD, COULD YOU
EXCUSE US, PLEASE?

12:24.300 --> 12:26.367
- EVERYBODY CAN STAY.
CAN'T THEY JUST STAY?

12:26.367 --> 12:27.733
WHERE'S YOUR MOTHER?

12:27.733 --> 12:29.967
- SHE NEEDED
SOME TIME ALONE, RAY.

12:29.967 --> 12:32.300
- HEY, WARREN, YOU WANNA GO
DOWN TO MARCO'S FOR A SLICE?

12:32.300 --> 12:33.833
- THEY HAVE OTHER THINGS
THERE?

12:33.833 --> 12:35.500
- FULL BAR.
- YOU DRIVE.

12:36.733 --> 12:38.500
- WHAT IF EMMA WAKES UP?

12:38.500 --> 12:41.667
- OH, SHE JUST WENT DOWN.
SHE'S GOOD FOR THREE HOURS.

12:51.633 --> 12:53.467
- LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING,
RAY.

12:53.467 --> 12:56.267
DID YOU SAY WHAT YOU SAID
TO MY MOTHER TO BE CRUEL,

12:56.267 --> 12:57.500
OR IS THAT
JUST HOW YOU FEEL--

12:57.500 --> 13:00.300
MEN JUST WANT
SOMEONE DIFFERENT?

13:02.367 --> 13:05.900
- SHE'S GOT YOU
IN THE CROSSHAIRS.

13:05.900 --> 13:08.333
- THAT'S HOW YOU FEEL,
ISN'T IT, FRANK?

13:08.333 --> 13:09.733
- WHAT THE HELL DID I DO?

13:09.733 --> 13:11.667
- OH, DON'T PLAY DUMB
WITH ME, MISTER.

13:11.667 --> 13:14.367
YOU'D LOVE TO HAVE
SOMEONE DIFFERENT, WOULDN'T YOU?

13:14.367 --> 13:16.767
- THAT'S A SECRET?

13:20.633 --> 13:22.200
- I'M NOT KIDDING AROUND,
FRANK.

13:22.200 --> 13:24.933
AND, RAYMOND,
HOW COULD YOU?

13:24.933 --> 13:26.933
WHERE IS YOUR COMPASSION?

13:26.933 --> 13:28.400
THE WOMAN HAS TEARS
IN HER EYES

13:28.400 --> 13:30.033
BECAUSE
SHE'S BEEN REPLACED,

13:30.033 --> 13:32.167
AND NOT BY SOME
YOUNG HOTSIE-TOTSIE GIRL,

13:32.167 --> 13:33.800
BUT BY AN OLDER WOMAN.

13:33.800 --> 13:36.700
WHAT IS HAPPENING?
HOW CAN YOU FIGHT THAT?

13:36.700 --> 13:38.733
AND A HUSBAND
WHO'S JUST SAID TO HER,

13:38.733 --> 13:40.633
"IT'S NOT YOUR LOOKS;
IT'S NOT YOUR BODY;

13:40.633 --> 13:41.700
IT'S YOU."

13:41.700 --> 13:43.767
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

13:43.767 --> 13:45.133
AND YOU'RE ALL THE SAME.

13:45.133 --> 13:47.967
- HEY! I AM NOTHING
LIKE THIS GUY.

13:47.967 --> 13:49.500
- HEY, DAD!

13:51.167 --> 13:52.833
- NO, SIR.
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

13:52.833 --> 13:55.900
I WANT TO EAT TONIGHT.

13:55.900 --> 13:59.867
THE SINS OF THE SON
SHALL NOT BOTHER THE FATHER.

13:59.867 --> 14:01.767
- COME ON.

14:01.767 --> 14:04.300
HONEY, YOU HAVE TO KNOW
I DIDN'T MEAN IT, RIGHT?

14:04.300 --> 14:05.633
IT JUST SLIPPED OUT.

14:05.633 --> 14:06.667
- YEAH, I KNOW IT DID,

14:06.667 --> 14:08.267
AND WE ALL GOT
A WONDERFUL INSIGHT

14:08.267 --> 14:09.633
INTO HOW YOU REALLY FEEL.

14:09.633 --> 14:10.667
- YES.

14:10.667 --> 14:12.200
- WHAT YOU HAVE
IS NEVER GOOD ENOUGH.

14:12.200 --> 14:13.633
THE GRASS IS ALWAYS GREENER,
HMM?

14:13.633 --> 14:15.267
IT'S ALL ABOUT
SOMEONE DIFFERENT,

14:15.267 --> 14:16.300
ISN'T IT, RAY?

14:16.300 --> 14:18.100
I REMEMBER CLAUDIA.

14:18.100 --> 14:19.800
- THE CLEANING LADY?

14:19.800 --> 14:21.733
- THAT'S RIGHT.

14:21.733 --> 14:23.267
- AFTER ALLY WAS BORN,
SHE CAME ONCE A WEEK TO HELP.

14:23.267 --> 14:24.700
- I REMEMBER.

14:24.700 --> 14:28.333
- SHE WEIGHED 200 POUNDS,
HAD BAD SKIN AND A LIMP,

14:28.333 --> 14:31.000
AND YOU STILL COULDN'T HELP
STARING AT HER!

14:33.600 --> 14:36.300
- NO ONE COULD!

14:36.300 --> 14:39.133
- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
YOU THINK I'M BLIND?

14:39.133 --> 14:40.767
I'D SEE YOU SITTIN'
ON THAT COUCH,

14:40.767 --> 14:42.500
SNEAKIN' PEEKS AT HER
WHILE SHE VACUUMED

14:42.500 --> 14:44.133
WITH THE SAME LOOK YOU HAVE

14:44.133 --> 14:46.300
FOR YOUR "SPORTS ILLUSTRATED"
SWIMSUIT ISSUE.

14:46.300 --> 14:48.833
YOU MAKE ME SICK!

14:48.833 --> 14:51.033
- I'M A LITTLE SICK TOO.

14:51.033 --> 14:52.800
- WAIT A MINUTE!

14:52.800 --> 14:55.200
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
YOU'RE TALKIN' ABOUT!

14:55.200 --> 14:57.267
OKAY, MAYBE I WOULD LOOK
AT THE SWIMSUIT ISSUE,

14:57.267 --> 14:58.967
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I'M GONNA LEAVE YOU

14:58.967 --> 15:00.667
FOR ONE OF THOSE GIRLS.

15:00.667 --> 15:03.000
- AND THE ONLY REASON YOU DON'T
IS THAT THEY DON'T ASK YOU.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.167
- THANK YOU, MA!

15:06.367 --> 15:07.900
- THIS IS THE POINT.

15:07.900 --> 15:09.433
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
ONE OF THOSE BIKINI GIRLS.

15:09.433 --> 15:11.033
IT COULD BE THE CHECKOUT GIRL
AT THE A&P

15:11.033 --> 15:13.333
OR A WAITRESS AT MARCO'S
OR CLAUDIA THE CLEANING LADY!

15:13.333 --> 15:15.000
- I DO NOT WANT CLAUDIA!

15:15.000 --> 15:16.333
- OH, BULL!
YOU'LL TAKE ANYONE

15:16.333 --> 15:17.867
AS LONG AS THEY'RE DIFFERENT,
RIGHT?

15:17.867 --> 15:20.567
- OHH!

15:20.567 --> 15:22.867
- STOP IT!

15:22.867 --> 15:25.833
COME ON!

15:25.833 --> 15:28.500
STOP IT, EVERYBODY!

15:28.500 --> 15:31.433
JUST STOP.

15:31.433 --> 15:35.333
COME ON, JUST--
NO HITTING.

15:37.533 --> 15:39.867
LOOK, W-WE'RE ALL
A LITTLE UPSET.

15:39.867 --> 15:42.467
THIS IS
AN UPSETTING SITUATION.

15:44.367 --> 15:49.400
YOUR FATHER CAME HOME
WITH AN OLD LADY...

15:53.400 --> 15:58.600
AND I CAN SEE HOW THAT
CAN MAKE YOU ALL...MAN-HATEY,

15:58.600 --> 16:02.267
BUT I DON'T WANT ANYONE ELSE,
AND I NEVER WILL.

16:02.267 --> 16:03.500
I DON'T WANT THE WAITRESS,

16:03.500 --> 16:05.000
I DON'T WANT
THE A&P LADY,

16:05.000 --> 16:06.500
AND, HONEY,
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME,

16:06.500 --> 16:10.367
I NEVER WANTED CLAUDIA,
THE 200-POUND CLEANING WOMAN.

16:11.700 --> 16:13.633
- WHAT ABOUT
THE SWIMSUIT MODEL?

16:13.633 --> 16:15.567
- NOT IF SHE BEGGED ME!

16:15.567 --> 16:16.767
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

16:21.833 --> 16:23.800
- FRANK?
- WHAT?

16:23.800 --> 16:26.000
- WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY?

16:26.000 --> 16:27.767
- THIS IS DUMB.

16:27.767 --> 16:31.433
YOU STILL NEED REASSURANCE
AFTER 45 YEARS OF BONDAGE?

16:36.600 --> 16:39.033
ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA
TELL YOU SOMETHING NOW

16:39.033 --> 16:40.633
I'VE NEVER TOLD
ANYONE ELSE BEFORE.

16:40.633 --> 16:44.267
I COULD HAVE HAD MY CHANCE
WITH CLAUDIA.

16:51.100 --> 16:53.133
- THAT'S RIGHT.

16:53.133 --> 16:54.533
THERE WAS ONE DAY

16:54.533 --> 16:56.267
I WAS DROPPING OFF
YOUR OLD HIGHCHAIR,

16:56.267 --> 16:59.067
AND THERE WAS NO ONE
AT YOUR APARTMENT EXCEPT HER.

16:59.067 --> 17:00.667
AND SHE LET ME IN,

17:00.667 --> 17:03.733
AND SHE ASKED ME IF I WANTED
SOMETHING TO DRINK,

17:03.733 --> 17:06.067
AND I SAID, "YEAH."

17:06.067 --> 17:07.467
I WAS THIRSTY

17:07.467 --> 17:10.133
FROM LUGGIN'
THE FREAKIN' HIGHCHAIR

17:10.133 --> 17:12.300
UP YOUR DAMN STEPS.

17:12.300 --> 17:14.700
SHE POURED ME
SOME ICED TEA,

17:14.700 --> 17:18.833
AND WHEN SHE STUCK HER HAND OUT
TO GIVE IT TO ME,

17:18.833 --> 17:21.067
AND I WENT FOR IT,

17:21.067 --> 17:23.900
SHE PULLED IT BACK
A LITTLE, YOU KNOW,

17:23.900 --> 17:27.867
LIKE PLAYFULLY?

17:27.867 --> 17:30.000
- THAT WHORE.

17:34.133 --> 17:36.000
- AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:36.000 --> 17:37.533
EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS NOT

17:37.533 --> 17:39.467
WHAT YOU WOULD CALL
CLASSICALLY BEAUTIFUL,

17:39.467 --> 17:42.067
I COULD SEE
WHAT RAY SAW IN HER.

17:42.067 --> 17:43.300
- DAD!

17:55.867 --> 17:58.033
- NO, NO,
SHE HAD SOMETHING.

17:58.033 --> 18:00.800
THERE WAS ALWAYS
A LITTLE RUMBA

18:00.800 --> 18:02.367
IN THE HORN SECTION.

18:03.633 --> 18:05.933
- I NEVER LOOKED
AT HER HORN SECTION.

18:05.933 --> 18:07.367
I SWEAR TO GOD.

18:09.967 --> 18:11.633
- AND I SAID,

18:11.633 --> 18:13.467
"JUST GIVE ME THE TEA,"

18:13.467 --> 18:15.600
LIKE THAT,

18:15.600 --> 18:17.767
AND SHE GAVE ME THE TEA.

18:17.767 --> 18:20.133
AND I DRANK IT,

18:20.133 --> 18:21.967
AND I HANDED HER
THE GLASS BACK,

18:21.967 --> 18:24.500
AND SHE WASHED IT,

18:24.500 --> 18:26.133
AND I LEFT.

18:26.133 --> 18:29.433
AND THAT WAS IT,

18:29.433 --> 18:34.333
BECAUSE I HAVE A WIFE
NAMED MARIE.

18:35.867 --> 18:37.733
- OH, FRANK.

18:37.733 --> 18:39.533
- THERE YOU GO.

18:42.867 --> 18:43.933
- WAIT A MINUTE.

18:43.933 --> 18:46.733
YOU WATCHED HER
WASH THE GLASS?

18:49.600 --> 18:52.300
- WELL, YEAH.
I'M NOT A MONK.

19:23.733 --> 19:26.067
- HI.
- HI.

19:26.067 --> 19:27.667
HELLO, RAYMOND.
- HI.

19:27.667 --> 19:28.800
LISTEN, UH,

19:28.800 --> 19:31.200
I'M SORRY
ABOUT WHAT I SAID BEFORE.

19:31.200 --> 19:32.167
- OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

19:32.167 --> 19:34.033
- NO, NO, IT'S NOT.

19:34.033 --> 19:35.200
I'M STUPID.

19:35.200 --> 19:36.967
- WELL, YOU CERTAINLY
ARE NOT.

19:36.967 --> 19:41.400
WHAT YOU SAID WAS TRUE,
NOT STUPID.

19:41.400 --> 19:43.067
- WELL, INSENSITIVE, THEN.

19:43.067 --> 19:45.233
- YES.

19:46.667 --> 19:51.100
BUT I'M NOT HURT,
HONESTLY.

19:51.100 --> 19:53.367
OF COURSE THE CIRCUMSTANCES
ARE A BIT SAD,

19:53.367 --> 19:55.367
BUT THIS IS WHAT DIVORCE IS,

19:55.367 --> 19:56.900
AND IF THIS IS WHAT IT IS,

19:56.900 --> 20:00.433
I'D RATHER WARREN AND I
LIVE THE REST OF OUR LIVES

20:00.433 --> 20:03.800
TRYING TO BE HAPPY
THAN NOT.

20:03.800 --> 20:06.233
- RIGHT.

20:12.833 --> 20:14.467
LISTEN, I--I...

20:14.467 --> 20:16.567
I HOPE--

20:16.567 --> 20:19.767
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY, TOO...

20:22.033 --> 20:24.233
MOM.

20:29.633 --> 20:32.800
- OHH.

20:32.800 --> 20:34.533
- OKAY. OKAY.

20:38.400 --> 20:40.533
- HE CALLED HER "MOM."

20:40.533 --> 20:44.100
- WELL, THAT HARDLY
SEEMS NECESSARY.

20:55.067 --> 20:56.400
- GREAT BIRD, DEBRA.

20:56.400 --> 20:58.900
I DIDN'T THINK
YOU HAD IT IN YA.

20:58.900 --> 21:00.033
- I GOT SOME ON ME.

21:00.033 --> 21:03.067
- HAVE YOU GOT A SPOT,
RAYMOND?

21:03.067 --> 21:04.933
I CAN GET THAT OFF
FOR YOU, SWEETIE.

21:04.933 --> 21:07.400
- OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT, LOIS.
I CAN GET THAT SPOT.

21:07.400 --> 21:10.300
I HAVE FOR OVER 40 YEARS.

21:10.300 --> 21:13.067
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
MY HANDSOME BOY?

21:13.067 --> 21:16.333
- OH, BOY. LOOK AT ME.

21:16.333 --> 21:19.767
I GOT A LOT
TO BE THANKFUL FOR.

21:19.767 --> 21:21.933
- ROBERT, COULD YOU PASS ME
THE POTATOES, PLEASE?

21:21.933 --> 21:24.167
- SURE.

21:24.167 --> 21:26.000
- OH, MY. SO HEAVY.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.667
- WELL, HERE YOU GO.
I GOTCHA.

21:28.667 --> 21:29.767
- THANK YOU, ROBERT.

21:29.767 --> 21:32.533
YOU'RE SO STRONG.

21:32.533 --> 21:34.633
- THANK YOU.

21:44.833 --> 21:46.300
SO, EMMA...

21:46.300 --> 21:48.500
ANY MORE AT HOME LIKE YOU?
