WEBVTT

00:11.094 --> 00:16.054
Break through the shining clouds,
and fly away (fly away)

00:16.058 --> 00:23.476
As a panorama spreads
itself throughout my being!

00:23.482 --> 00:28.943
The earth, having been kicked
in the face, gets angry (angry)!

00:28.946 --> 00:35.112
And makes one of
its volcanoes explode!

00:35.118 --> 00:42.035
If, within the thawed polar ice,

00:42.042 --> 00:51.041
There is a dinosaur, then I want
to train him to balance atop a ball.

00:51.051 --> 00:54.339
CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA

00:54.346 --> 01:03.562
No matter what may happen,
I feel as though nothing can bother me,

01:03.564 --> 01:06.977
CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA

01:06.984 --> 01:12.980
However hard your chest pounds,
the Genki Dama will roar!

01:12.990 --> 01:16.073
CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA

01:16.076 --> 01:25.075
The emptier your head is, the more
room there is to pack with dreams,

01:25.085 --> 01:28.998
CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA

01:29.006 --> 01:35.923
With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,
today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...

01:35.929 --> 01:37.885
Sparking!

01:48.775 --> 01:53.769
" Planet Vegeta"

01:58.910 --> 02:05.031
On Planet Vegeta, a baby
boy lets out his first cry.

02:11.965 --> 02:17.255
Kakarrot? So this is Bardock's son, then?

02:17.262 --> 02:20.880
Yeah. He sure is the kid
of a lower class warrior.

02:20.891 --> 02:24.884
He's barely got any
potential ability at all.

02:24.895 --> 02:29.889
I guess all we can do with him is send
him off to one of the frontier planets.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.891
I suppose so.

02:57.844 --> 03:01.928
" Planet Kanassa"

05:02.636 --> 05:04.547
That bastard.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.674
That's what you get
for dropping your guard.

05:09.810 --> 05:13.803
So Bardock, don't you think
you went over the top there,

05:13.814 --> 05:16.021
even celebrating your son's birth and all?

05:16.024 --> 05:18.481
Celebrating my son's birth?

05:19.820 --> 05:22.812
What a ridiculous farce!

05:22.823 --> 05:25.064
We're finished on this planet.

05:25.075 --> 05:28.909
Why don't you head back to
Planet Vegeta and meet him?

05:31.331 --> 05:36.200
To see the lowest-class
warrior without any promise at all?

05:37.546 --> 05:40.333
What kind of fool would make that trip?

05:40.340 --> 05:43.377
And who asked you what
I should be doing anyhow?

05:43.385 --> 05:45.250
| see.

05:48.765 --> 05:52.223
We ought to be grateful to Freeza-sama.

05:52.227 --> 05:56.470
He's been putting us to
work for him quite often.

05:56.481 --> 06:02.477
So what does Freeza-sama want
with a crummy little planet like this?

06:03.446 --> 06:04.811
You know what I heard?

06:04.823 --> 06:08.190
This Kanassa is supposed
to have some kind of energy

06:08.201 --> 06:11.193
that grants you psychic abilities.

06:11.204 --> 06:14.071
I don't know whether he
believes that rumor or not,

06:14.082 --> 06:15.913
but apparently Freeza-sama

06:15.917 --> 06:18.829
has been thinking of taking
this world for a long time.

06:27.345 --> 06:28.380
Wha-?

06:36.730 --> 06:38.345
Rotten scum!

07:00.754 --> 07:03.086
Looks like I dropped my guard too.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.204
You lousy rat!

07:04.215 --> 07:05.921
L- Listen to me!

07:05.926 --> 07:08.713
| just struck you using a technique...

07:08.720 --> 07:12.133
...giving you knowledge
of the future through visions!

07:12.724 --> 07:14.760
Knowledge of the future?

07:14.768 --> 07:20.764
You will see the future
fate of your own people.

07:20.774 --> 07:23.186
W- What is this guy talking about?

07:23.193 --> 07:28.733
I will warn you now, that you have
no future save that which is cursed!

07:28.740 --> 07:33.359
As it is with my own people, there will
be nothing but destruction for yours!

07:33.370 --> 07:38.239
| condemn you to see your own future,
and agonize over the form it takes!

07:41.753 --> 07:43.209
Enough!

07:50.345 --> 07:51.710
That's pretty funny.

07:51.721 --> 07:56.715
What do we invincible Saiyans have
to watch and agonize over, I ask you?

07:57.727 --> 07:59.638
Right, Bardo-?

08:03.733 --> 08:05.143
--Hey, Bardock!
--Bardock!

08:05.151 --> 08:07.733
--What's wrong?
--What's the matter?
--Shake it off!

08:07.737 --> 08:10.820
--Hey, Bardock!
--Bardock!
--Hey!

08:47.110 --> 08:49.772
He's avoiding every one of their attacks!

08:49.779 --> 08:51.519
He's incredible!

09:19.684 --> 09:21.891
U- Unbelievable!

09:21.895 --> 09:25.808
He finished off those strength-enhanced
Saibaimen in a matter of seconds!

09:27.609 --> 09:29.065
What's so unbelievable?

09:29.069 --> 09:32.903
Vegeta-sama wasn't
even giving them his best!

09:32.906 --> 09:34.771
What a fearsome kid!

09:34.783 --> 09:35.772
I'm
don
e!

09:35.784 --> 09:37.069
Hurry and open the gate!

09:37.077 --> 09:38.487
Rogeï¬‚

09:42.290 --> 09:44.827
Impressive, as always.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.825
Cut out the ridiculous boot-licking!

09:51.299 --> 09:54.382
As long as | stay on this world,
I won't ever get stronger.

09:54.385 --> 09:56.671
Maybe I should ask
Freeza-sama about letting...

09:56.679 --> 10:00.592
...me have another one of his
worlds slated for conquering.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.806
Again?

10:01.810 --> 10:03.596
You'd rather I didn't?

10:03.603 --> 10:05.343
Of course not!

10:09.442 --> 10:15.358
Freeza-sama, we have just received word
that Planet Kanassa has been conquered.

10:17.242 --> 10:20.609
We have acquired it fully one
month sooner than had been forecast.

10:20.620 --> 10:25.284
Who was it we sent
to take over Kanassa?

10:25.291 --> 10:28.624
Some nameless
lower-class Saiyan warriors.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.619
Saiyans?

10:30.630 --> 10:33.918
These latest guys have been
working pretty hard, don't you think?

10:33.925 --> 10:36.837
There's certainly
something remarkable about them.

10:37.804 --> 10:40.546
Particularly when it
comes to Vegeta, their prince,

10:40.557 --> 10:42.639
with whom Freeza-sama
has taken such an interest.

10:42.642 --> 10:46.226
I can't hardly believe a kid like
that has such a battle power.

10:46.229 --> 10:48.561
It's more than just him.

10:48.565 --> 10:50.647
Individually, there's
nothing special about them,

10:50.650 --> 10:54.643
but when they team up, they
demonstrate incredible power.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.237
What are you afraid of?

10:58.241 --> 11:00.573
Nothing. I just think that,

11:00.577 --> 11:02.613
if we leave the
Saiyans alone like this,

11:02.620 --> 11:06.579
it will mean a lot of
trouble for us later on.

11:06.583 --> 11:09.871
You never know when another
guy like Vegeta may appear.

11:09.878 --> 11:13.496
Let's suppose they were
to team up against us.

11:16.259 --> 11:19.171
You think they might
become unpleasant, then?

11:20.138 --> 11:21.127
Aye.

11:24.559 --> 11:25.799
What do you think you're doing?

11:25.810 --> 11:27.550
Why are you here?

11:27.562 --> 11:30.554
This isn't the sort of
place where you belong!

11:32.233 --> 11:37.193
I've just come to pay my
respects to Freeza-sama as I depart.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.607
There's no need for that.

11:38.615 --> 11:41.823
Just worry about clearing
your assigned planet for now.

11:42.577 --> 11:44.568
It is quite all right, Zarbon-san.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.991
Freeza-sama?

11:54.088 --> 11:58.127
Vegeta, please do a thorough job.

11:59.594 --> 12:00.583
Thank you very much.

12:04.515 --> 12:06.506
There is no need to thank me so.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.786
Bardock is as surprising as ever.

12:36.798 --> 12:40.882
It's only taken him
several days to fully recover.

12:40.885 --> 12:43.843
Yeah. He may be a low class warrior,

12:43.846 --> 12:45.177
but every time he goes
off to clear some land,

12:45.181 --> 12:48.173
he always manages to nearly
get killed before returning.

12:48.184 --> 12:52.177
By now, his battle power
should be pretty close to 10,000.

12:52.188 --> 12:54.349
He's quite a guy.

12:54.357 --> 12:56.188
How is he?

12:56.192 --> 12:58.183
Physically there's nothing wrong.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.900
He's in perfect shape.

12:59.904 --> 13:04.898
However, the computer is picking
up a fluctuation in his brain waves.

13:04.909 --> 13:06.069
I see.

13:06.077 --> 13:09.911
Oh well, this time we'll
have to leave Bardock behind.

13:09.914 --> 13:10.778
Yeah.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.122
Which planet are you off to this time?

13:14.210 --> 13:16.201
Planet Meat.

14:06.763 --> 14:08.674
Is he regaining consciousness?

14:31.412 --> 14:33.152
I just struck you using a technique...

14:33.164 --> 14:37.157
...giving you knowledge
of the future through visions!

14:38.920 --> 14:43.880
You will see the future
fate of your own people.

14:44.175 --> 14:49.886
I will warn you now, that you have
no future save that which is cursed!

14:49.889 --> 14:55.054
As it is with my own people, there will
be nothing but destruction for yours!

14:55.061 --> 14:59.976
| condemn you to see your own future,
and agonize over the form it takes!

15:22.588 --> 15:24.795
Are you all right, Bardock?

15:26.759 --> 15:28.169
Yeah.

15:30.012 --> 15:33.004
I'm still a bit dizzy in the head, though.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.140
I was having these strange dreams.

15:44.152 --> 15:45.141
Dreams?

15:45.153 --> 15:46.142
Yeah.

15:47.363 --> 15:50.275
I wonder what they were all about.

15:51.492 --> 15:54.029
Are you sure you're okay?

15:54.036 --> 15:57.153
I'm made of tougher stuff than
you guys are, much tougher.

15:57.165 --> 15:59.577
Never mind me, what
happened to Toma and the others?

15:59.584 --> 16:03.998
They were ordered by
Freeza-sama to the planet Meat.

16:04.005 --> 16:08.044
Whatl? Dammit, how
could they leave me out?

16:08.050 --> 16:11.008
Planet Meat, eh?
All right, that's pretty close.

16:11.012 --> 16:12.092
Hey, Bardock!

16:27.028 --> 16:32.113
| condemn you to see your own future,
and agonize over the form it takes!

16:50.051 --> 16:52.133
Kakar... rot?

16:57.934 --> 17:00.050
A battle power of just 2?

17:00.061 --> 17:01.050
What scum!

17:23.376 --> 17:24.365
Damn...

17:33.052 --> 17:35.885
W- Why?

17:35.888 --> 17:37.879
Why are you guys-

17:45.398 --> 17:49.482
You Saiyans,
you're as tough as I expected.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.896
However...

17:57.910 --> 18:00.993
You'll have to let us
toy with you a little more.

18:00.997 --> 18:05.991
Why!? Why are you doing this?

18:06.002 --> 18:08.914
Is that bothering you?

18:08.921 --> 18:12.004
All right, you can take
this to Hell with you.

18:16.846 --> 18:19.588
This, you see,

18:19.599 --> 18:22.887
was ordered by Freeza-sama!

18:22.893 --> 18:24.884
W- What!?

18:24.895 --> 18:29.434
Freeza-sama denounced
you Saiyans as troublesome!

18:29.442 --> 18:33.606
You sure you didn't
do anything to upset him?

18:33.613 --> 18:35.023
|- It's untrue!

18:35.031 --> 18:39.900
We've always acted exactly
as ordered by Freeza-sama!

18:39.910 --> 18:42.902
Never once have we...

18:42.913 --> 18:46.781
Nevertheless, if you fall out
of favor, this is what happens!

18:47.460 --> 18:52.454
This? After all
the hard work we've done?

18:53.924 --> 18:55.915
That's...

18:55.926 --> 18:57.041
right!

19:08.773 --> 19:12.857
Looks like they got carried away again.

19:12.860 --> 19:14.725
Those guys...

19:17.365 --> 19:19.356
Mm? There they are!

19:19.367 --> 19:22.404
All caught up in the
moment rioting around, no doubt.

19:44.934 --> 19:46.925
What the...

19:46.936 --> 19:48.847
B- Bardock?

19:53.859 --> 19:54.848
Toma!

19:56.862 --> 19:59.854
What's going on here?
What happened?

20:00.866 --> 20:02.857
What a fool I've been.

20:02.868 --> 20:05.530
We should have stayed home
tucked in our beds like good children.

20:05.538 --> 20:08.871
Never mind that, don't tell me
the Meatians got the best of you?

20:08.874 --> 20:12.458
No. We eliminated them quickly.

20:12.461 --> 20:14.452
Then who did this to you?

20:15.881 --> 20:20.796
F- Freeza! He's stabbed us all in the back!

20:20.803 --> 20:22.794
That can't be possible!

20:23.889 --> 20:28.883
That rotten Freeza's just been using us.

20:32.857 --> 20:36.816
|- I've already had it, but before long...

20:37.862 --> 20:41.855
...all Saiyans are going
to be killed by that rat Freeza.

20:43.492 --> 20:49.863
Listen to me, listen well...
Go back to Planet Vegeta right now!

20:49.874 --> 20:53.913
Once there, gather our
comrades and defeat Freeza!

20:58.883 --> 21:08.975
Let him know... how strong
the Saiyans... really... are...

22:24.844 --> 22:26.675
You guys!

22:31.433 --> 22:34.345
Now comes your turn to die!

23:36.457 --> 23:38.448
You lowlife! Where did you go!?

23:45.466 --> 23:46.922
Damn him!

23:50.763 --> 23:51.798
You fool!

24:14.745 --> 24:18.738
T- This can't be! He's supposed
to be a lowest-class warrior!

24:18.749 --> 24:23.334
Regardless of his level,
he's still a Saiyan! Stay on your toes!

24:23.337 --> 24:24.747
Let's go!

24:29.802 --> 24:31.838
Kaio-ken!

24:42.815 --> 24:45.727
What's the matter, Kakarrot!?

24:45.734 --> 24:48.567
I know you're better than this!

24:49.196 --> 24:54.111
Not again! Damn,
what's going on in my head!?

25:05.921 --> 25:07.832
No, wai-

25:20.394 --> 25:21.725
Why! ?

25:31.280 --> 25:33.396
D- D- Dodoria!

25:33.407 --> 25:35.318
w- Why!?

25:35.325 --> 25:37.281
Why are you doing this to us!?

26:17.367 --> 26:20.609
That was all too brief.

26:20.621 --> 26:23.613
I wish he'd have
entertained me a bit longer.

26:23.624 --> 26:25.285
Come in, Dodoria.

26:25.292 --> 26:27.374
You are ordered to return.

26:27.377 --> 26:29.789
Rendezvous with us immediately.

26:29.797 --> 26:32.288
We're headed for Planet Vegeta.

26:32.299 --> 26:33.709
Understood.

27:09.211 --> 27:10.200
Dammit.

27:12.631 --> 27:16.624
Freeza-sama really is after us.

27:32.234 --> 27:35.226
Launch this one off, if you would.

27:35.237 --> 27:40.152
Target directional coordinates FX-50.

27:40.159 --> 27:43.242
Name: Kakarrot.

27:43.245 --> 27:46.157
Bardock's son, hmm?

27:46.165 --> 27:48.247
Rank: Lowest-class warrior.

27:48.250 --> 27:51.242
Planet of destination:...

28:00.429 --> 28:02.420
I have returned.

28:10.189 --> 28:12.225
Dodoria, you bungled it.

28:12.232 --> 28:13.517
What's that!?

28:13.525 --> 28:17.143
You allowed one of the
Saiyans on Planet Meat to escape.

28:17.154 --> 28:19.145
Impossible! I made certain...

28:19.156 --> 28:21.021
Then what have we here?

28:23.202 --> 28:25.158
It's him!

28:25.162 --> 28:27.153
He survived that!?

28:36.256 --> 28:39.168
T- This is inexcusable of me!

28:39.176 --> 28:41.212
I- I will deal with him immediately!

28:41.220 --> 28:43.211
Oh, it is all right.

28:44.181 --> 28:49.801
This Saiyan also seems to be
headed toward Planet Vegeta anyhow.

28:50.812 --> 28:54.100
Then he will meet the same
fate either way, won't he?

29:09.122 --> 29:13.115
T- That's Freeza-sama's spaceship.

29:19.216 --> 29:23.801
H- He couldn't be headed
for Planet Vegeta, could he?

29:23.804 --> 29:25.760
I can't believe it!

29:30.394 --> 29:35.184
It has been some time since we have
seen the best show in the universe.

29:35.190 --> 29:37.522
I hope the fireworks are pretty.

30:03.760 --> 30:05.751
Kakarrot!

30:47.304 --> 30:48.635
What's the matter, Bardock!?

30:50.766 --> 30:54.759
What a shame, you just
missed your kid's launch!

30:54.770 --> 30:58.729
As I remember, he's going to
some frontier planet called "Earth."

31:00.067 --> 31:01.728
Did you say "Earth?"

31:01.735 --> 31:04.727
Yeah, it's a blue planet,
part of a star system.

31:04.738 --> 31:06.774
He may be a low-class warrior,

31:06.782 --> 31:10.070
but give him a few months,
and he's sure to wipe out the planet.

31:10.077 --> 31:14.741
Once you've recovered from those injuries,
you ought to go meet up with him.

31:14.748 --> 31:16.739
So what happened to you?

31:16.750 --> 31:20.083
How did a guy like you
get beat up so badly?

31:20.087 --> 31:22.794
--I thought you went
to Planet Meat, didn't you?
--That's...

31:22.798 --> 31:26.086
That's Earth! There '5 no mistake.

31:26.093 --> 31:30.757
All those dreams I've had...
they're really the future!

31:31.723 --> 31:33.634
Which means...

31:41.400 --> 31:42.981
It- It can't be!

31:42.984 --> 31:45.726
W- What's the matter, Bardock!?

31:45.737 --> 31:47.728
Hey, look at this!

31:48.990 --> 31:52.073
H- He's far from being
all right, wouldn't you say!?

32:09.719 --> 32:13.007
That's really the future!

32:26.736 --> 32:31.696
Everything... happens... for real!

32:45.422 --> 32:47.629
I just struck you using a technique...

32:47.632 --> 32:51.625
...giving you knowledge
of the future through visions!

32:52.971 --> 32:57.055
You will see the future
fate of your own people.

32:59.603 --> 33:04.688
I will warn you now, that you have
no future save that which is cursed!

33:06.151 --> 33:11.612
As it is with my own people, there will
be nothing but destruction for yours!

33:11.615 --> 33:16.609
| condemn you to see your own future,
and agonize over the form it takes!

34:13.969 --> 34:18.633
I won't let him do it.
I'll stop him myself!

34:24.437 --> 34:26.098
Freeza!

34:56.845 --> 34:58.381
What's this?

34:58.388 --> 35:00.549
Ain't that Bardock?

35:00.557 --> 35:02.593
What's the matter?

35:07.606 --> 35:12.600
Everyone, come with me!
We're going to kill Freeza!

35:12.611 --> 35:13.600
What?

35:13.612 --> 35:15.603
What are you saying!?

35:16.615 --> 35:18.981
Believe me.

35:18.992 --> 35:23.986
Toma, and the others, they were all killed!

35:23.997 --> 35:29.993
Freeza is about to eliminate us...
about to eliminate Planet Vegeta!

35:41.514 --> 35:44.506
He says the planet is
going to be destroyed!

35:44.517 --> 35:46.508
A- Are you all right?

35:46.519 --> 35:48.601
Get a grip on yourself, Bardock!

35:48.605 --> 35:52.598
Freeza-sama would never
do something like that!

35:54.527 --> 35:57.485
Are you sure you didn't
just have a bad dream?

36:03.620 --> 36:06.532
You... worthless... fools!

36:12.629 --> 36:14.540
You miserable jackasses!

36:18.134 --> 36:20.125
I'm not asking any more!

36:21.805 --> 36:26.720
All of you can go to hell!

36:26.726 --> 36:27.681
Hey, Bardock!

36:27.686 --> 36:30.678
Let him go, he's flipped his lid.

37:16.067 --> 37:18.058
Kakarrot!

38:29.974 --> 38:34.058
I... I will...

38:41.069 --> 38:44.937
...change that future!

39:05.093 --> 39:09.928
This will be the last time we
gaze upon this planet, will it not?

39:09.931 --> 39:10.920
Aye.

39:11.933 --> 39:12.922
Freeza-sama!

39:48.928 --> 39:49.917
Zarbon-san.

39:49.929 --> 39:50.918
Sir.

39:50.930 --> 39:53.012
Open the upper hatch.

39:54.893 --> 39:57.885
But, our men out there...

40:00.940 --> 40:02.896
As you command!

40:25.048 --> 40:27.039
Freeza!!

40:36.935 --> 40:39.972
Freeza! Get out here!

40:41.898 --> 40:44.935
I won't let you get away with this!

40:56.913 --> 40:57.948
Freeza-sama!

40:59.916 --> 41:01.952
F- Freeza-sama!

41:08.675 --> 41:12.293
Now, everything changes!

41:12.887 --> 41:15.970
The fate of Planet Vegeta...

41:20.895 --> 41:23.887
...my own fate...

41:25.900 --> 41:27.891
...Kakarrot's fate...

41:28.903 --> 41:33.988
...as well as your fate!

41:41.916 --> 41:43.998
This is where it ends!

41:56.889 --> 41:57.924
W- What!?

42:09.485 --> 42:11.100
Freeza-sama!

42:23.875 --> 42:27.914
Ka... kar... ro... t...

42:36.846 --> 42:38.928
Kakarrot!

42:55.865 --> 42:57.856
What's this!?

43:15.343 --> 43:16.708
How wonderful!

43:16.719 --> 43:23.932
Look at it, Zarbon-san, Dodoria-san!
Behold such beautiful fireworks!

43:44.288 --> 43:48.782
Kakarrot, carry out my will!

43:48.793 --> 43:54.834
You will avenge the Saiyans,
and our Planet Vegeta!

44:09.188 --> 44:12.726
Vegeta-sama! Do you read me?

44:12.733 --> 44:13.813
What is it?

44:13.818 --> 44:17.026
We've just received a
transmission from Freeza-sama.

44:17.029 --> 44:21.022
It seems as though Planet
Vegeta has been destroyed!

44:21.826 --> 44:22.815
And?

44:22.827 --> 44:25.785
Apparently a giant meteor
collided with the planet.

44:25.788 --> 44:30.748
Counting us, there are
very few surviving Saiyans.

44:31.752 --> 44:32.832
And?

44:34.755 --> 44:38.748
Er, nothing else in particular.
That was all.

44:38.759 --> 44:40.795
This planet is all but exterminated.

44:40.803 --> 44:45.797
I'll have to request Freeza-sama to give
us worlds that will put up more of a fight.

45:03.826 --> 45:05.737
Well, what a surprise!

45:06.746 --> 45:09.829
A baby! Where did you come from?

45:16.214 --> 45:18.626
A baby with a tail?

45:19.926 --> 45:23.384
We can't just leave you here, can we?

45:23.387 --> 45:25.673
How would you like
to come stay with me?

45:25.681 --> 45:26.761
Oww!

45:27.767 --> 45:30.258
Oh, such a spirited young boy!

45:30.269 --> 45:36.390
Okay, from now on, you'll be
the grandson of me, Son Gohan, okay?

45:36.400 --> 45:39.767
And your name will be... let's see...

45:44.408 --> 45:47.696
Goku! Son Goku!

45:48.704 --> 45:51.787
Goku, you're going to grow up strong!

45:51.791 --> 45:54.407
Whee!

45:55.711 --> 45:58.703
Whee whee whee!

45:58.714 --> 45:59.703
Whee!

45:59.715 --> 46:07.429
And thus the curtain rises for
the grand story that is Dragonball.

46:20.486 --> 46:29.360
There is one ocean in the galaxy,

46:33.874 --> 46:39.369
And continues on its distant journey,

46:39.380 --> 46:46.627
until now it arrives to shine above me.

46:46.637 --> 46:52.348
The light that shines in the darkness,

46:52.351 --> 47:02.317
Twinkles like the wink of a dream.

47:02.320 --> 47:08.361
Please let me hear
the hopes and memories

47:08.367 --> 47:15.364
Which have come to us from so long ago.

47:15.374 --> 47:25.921
The unchanging dreams
and everlasting love,

47:25.926 --> 47:37.144
Which shined even before we were born.
