You were a nurse.

19:23.354 --> 19:24.220
Figured you'd be all-in

19:24.280 --> 19:25.979
for giving birth surrounded

19:26.040 --> 19:27.665
by all the medical bells
and whistles.

19:27.816 --> 19:29.000
When I got pregnant,

19:29.151 --> 19:30.150
even though
it wasn't exactly planned,

19:30.253 --> 19:32.503
-we were really excited.
-Mm.

19:36.367 --> 19:40.327
Then everything changed.

19:40.346 --> 19:43.330
Became about protocols

19:43.433 --> 19:46.017
No visitors at the hospital
or even at home

19:46.210 --> 19:48.168
and I really tried to roll
with it.

19:48.229 --> 19:49.595
You know, to adjust.

19:49.689 --> 19:54.099

The weight pulls you under.

19:57.855 --> 20:00.364
Yeah, I guess a home birth

20:00.516 --> 20:02.683
was my way of trying
to get back some control.

20:02.744 --> 20:05.261
Mm.

20:05.321 --> 20:10.357
You know,
she was the perfect pregnancy.

20:10.418 --> 20:12.859
Barely had any
morning sickness.

20:12.879 --> 20:16.121
My mood swung from laughter
to tears of happiness.

20:18.551 --> 20:21.201

-Ah.

20:21.221 --> 20:23.370
But the second pregnancy.
Mm.

20:23.431 --> 20:25.614
Total opposite.

20:25.633 --> 20:28.509
I mean, we had been trying
for years to get pregnant again

20:31.347 --> 20:34.381

20:34.442 --> 20:37.551
I was afraid that something was
gonna go wrong.

Michael had just lost
his father.

20:39.822 --> 20:41.297
I was sick all the time.

20:41.315 --> 20:45.134
It was not a joyous
nine months.

20:45.152 --> 20:48.395
But...

20:48.456 --> 20:51.732
when they placed
that little boy on my chest,

20:51.793 --> 20:54.568
it felt the same.

20:54.629 --> 20:56.737
And the leadup to how we got
to that moment,

20:56.798 --> 20:58.422
it didn't matter.

20:58.574 --> 21:01.166
He was as much a miracle to me
as his sister had been,

21:01.302 --> 21:03.744
maybe even a little more,

21:03.805 --> 21:09.082
because it felt like I had
to fight so hard to have him.

21:09.143 --> 21:11.084
I really can't wait
to meet her.

21:11.145 --> 21:13.162
