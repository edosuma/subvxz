38:41.720 --> 38:45.457
Fine, Hugh. Just fine.
This is my friend
Dale Malloy.

38:45.524 --> 38:47.693
Glad to have you.
Pleasure.

38:47.759 --> 38:51.162
[ Coughing ]
I gotta get a drink.

38:51.229 --> 38:56.334
- [ Hugh ]
Oh, the bar's over there.
- Will you folks excuse us?

38:56.402 --> 39:00.939
You're lucky I'm in love.
Otherwise, I'd kick your asses
right outta here.

39:01.006 --> 39:02.941
Oh, look, Dale. Shrimp.

39:04.410 --> 39:06.745
[ Sighs ]
Dahlia.

39:06.812 --> 39:09.748
Shit, Wayne.
Ken must have told him
where we are.

39:09.815 --> 39:12.551
What is he doin'
with the one-armed bandit?

39:12.618 --> 39:15.320
Dale is a psycho.
I know he's playing
some kind of game.

39:15.387 --> 39:17.423
I'm gonna talk to him.

39:25.731 --> 39:28.400
Hey, there.
I've been looking for you
everywhere.

39:28.467 --> 39:30.569
Oh, Nina.
You look so pretty.
Where's Jim?

39:30.636 --> 39:33.872
Jim hates Hugh.
He and Wes are home, baking.

39:33.939 --> 39:37.242
Wes has got a plan to open up
one of those cupcake places.

39:37.308 --> 39:40.245
Well, that's nice,
'cause everyone like cupcakes.
You know, I gotta find Doug.

39:40.311 --> 39:42.881
Dahlia, can we talk?
Can we have coffee tomorrow
mornin'?

39:42.948 --> 39:44.716
No, now.
Okay.

39:46.251 --> 39:48.286
Doug.

39:48.353 --> 39:50.722
Dale.
Here, let me top you off.

39:50.789 --> 39:52.924
[ Champagne Pouring ]

39:52.991 --> 39:56.495
We have a lot to talk about,
my friend.
Mm-hmm.

39:56.562 --> 39:59.531
So, who dressed you?
I did.

39:59.598 --> 40:02.167
So I seen the kids
around the neighborhood.

40:02.233 --> 40:06.438
Dahlia drivin' a big fancy--
Oh, I mean, Cherien drivin'
a big fancy car.

40:06.505 --> 40:10.008
Wow, you're doin' really
well for yourself bein'
a successful attorney.

40:15.013 --> 40:18.016
You know, in some ways,
this is the happiest
I've been in a long time.

40:18.083 --> 40:22.721
It's been a relief,
this whole business with Jim.

40:22.788 --> 40:25.757
I mean, like a weight's
come off our shoulders.

40:25.824 --> 40:29.027
I never realized how hard
it was to keep living a lie.

40:30.996 --> 40:33.599
Or how lonely.

40:34.933 --> 40:38.670
Here's the other thing
I've come to.

40:38.737 --> 40:40.939
I can't abide being
lied to anymore.

40:42.307 --> 40:44.676
Not by people I care about.

40:46.277 --> 40:48.179
Uh--

40:48.246 --> 40:51.550
Y'all aren't in the Witness
Protection Program, are you?

40:51.617 --> 40:55.020
'Cause I've been thinking
about it, and it just
doesn't quite make sense.

40:55.086 --> 41:00.258
I mean, if that Pete guy
was with the, say, F.B.I.,
then he'd know...

41:00.325 --> 41:03.695
you were in
the Witness Protection Program
and that you were the Riches.

41:03.762 --> 41:06.965
That's the name
they'd given you.

41:07.032 --> 41:08.634
Mmm.

41:08.700 --> 41:12.237
I don't want to put you
on the spot.

41:12.303 --> 41:15.206
What is going on?

41:18.343 --> 41:20.712
All right. All right.

41:22.848 --> 41:27.285
What?
You don't have to tell me
anything.

41:27.352 --> 41:29.220
I just wish
you wouldn't lie to me.

41:32.691 --> 41:35.861
You're my friend, Nina.

41:35.927 --> 41:38.229
I would never lie
to you about that.

41:40.766 --> 41:44.135
[ Hugh ]
Hey, quiet, everybody!
Everybody quiet!

41:44.202 --> 41:46.137
Listen up, everybody!

41:46.204 --> 41:48.707
Come on over here, honey.

41:49.708 --> 41:52.510
I want to propose a toast.

41:52.578 --> 41:56.414
To the most beautiful gal
I've ever set eyes on.

41:56.481 --> 42:00.619
I've known lots
of great women in my day.

42:00.686 --> 42:03.855
But I've never known
happiness until--

42:03.922 --> 42:06.491
until I met GiGi last week.

42:06.558 --> 42:09.060
What happened?
This little girl...

42:09.127 --> 42:12.631
has shown me
the true meaning of love.

42:14.432 --> 42:17.435
She's got her hands on my heart,
and she hasn't let go,

42:17.502 --> 42:20.138
and I thank God for that.

42:20.205 --> 42:25.143
So, to my beautiful bride,
GiGi Panetta!

[ All Cheering ]

42:28.246 --> 42:31.583
Hear, hear!

42:31.650 --> 42:34.219
Oh, oh.

42:34.285 --> 42:37.322
And, uh, here's a little
Louisiana surprise.

42:37.388 --> 42:39.658
[ Chuckles ]

42:41.627 --> 42:46.832
** [ Piano ]
* We're back from Vegas
and everything is right *

42:46.898 --> 42:51.770
* It's the same this morning
as it was last night *

42:51.837 --> 42:54.439
* You're the one, baby *

42:54.505 --> 42:57.575
I can't do it.
* You the one *

42:57.643 --> 43:02.047
I can't do it.
I want to do it for you,
but I can't be a buffer.

43:02.113 --> 43:04.549
You're not a buffer.
You're a Traveller.

43:04.616 --> 43:08.286
No, I'm not.
Not anymore.

43:08.353 --> 43:12.090
I don't belong there either now,
'cause I know too much...

43:12.157 --> 43:15.060
about all this,
all these people.

43:16.828 --> 43:21.399
I'm not Dahlia Malloy,
and I'm not Cherien Rich.

43:21.466 --> 43:26.337
Now, you said we were gonna
come here, be somebody,
and I don't know who that is.

43:27.673 --> 43:30.709
I know who you are.
You're my wife.

43:30.776 --> 43:32.744
You're the mother
of my children.

43:32.811 --> 43:36.147
And you're the most
important person in my life.

43:37.816 --> 43:40.385
And that's who you'll always be,
wherever we are.

43:40.451 --> 43:45.390
I cannot make a truth out of
all the lies I'm telling myself
and everyone else.

* GiGi, you're the one *

** [ Ends ]

43:52.397 --> 43:54.700

All right, y'all!
Let's get this party started!
Come on!

43:59.470 --> 44:03.541
Here, take the car.
Go home and be
with the children.

44:03.608 --> 44:05.911
Okay?

** [ Disco ]

44:27.265 --> 44:30.568
So what do we do?
I am not going back to camp.

44:30.635 --> 44:34.505
No one's asking you to.
Goddamn it, Cael. You know,
this is all your fault.

44:34.572 --> 44:37.575
If you wouldn't have gone
to see Tammy, then they wouldn't
even know where we are.

44:37.642 --> 44:40.278
They would have found us
sooner or later.
No, they wouldn't have, Cael!

44:40.345 --> 44:43.481
All right, come on.
Why don't you just admit
it, Cael? You blew it.

44:43.548 --> 44:47.018
You ruined this for everyone.
You know what? You're never
gonna be a buffer, Di.

44:47.085 --> 44:49.721
Drop it.
It's never gonna happen.
You're a Traveller.

44:49.788 --> 44:51.823
You're always gonna
be a Traveller.

Oh, knock it off.
Jesus.

44:56.461 --> 44:59.430
Think all your yelling
and screaming's gonna
do anything?

45:01.666 --> 45:03.769
It's over.

45:05.470 --> 45:07.538
Maybe we don't do anything.

45:07.605 --> 45:10.175
No, Dad, we have
to do something.
Dale came here for us.

45:10.241 --> 45:13.611
He's not goin' anywhere.
Dale seems to have been here
for a while now.

45:13.678 --> 45:16.915
He could have blown our cover
at any point, and he didn't.
Why is that?

45:16.982 --> 45:19.150
He's Dale.
He's workin' an angle.
I don't know.

45:19.217 --> 45:22.353
Well, we gotta work out
what the angle is
and work it against him.

45:22.420 --> 45:25.223
Then why the hell is he
hangin' out with that stupid
Hartley Underwood chick?

45:25.290 --> 45:29.460
Dale has got a plan.
Okay, what?

45:29.527 --> 45:31.763
I don't know.

45:31.830 --> 45:35.767
I guess he'll let us know
sooner or later.

45:35.834 --> 45:38.369
What are we supposed to do
in the meantime, Dad?

45:39.971 --> 45:43.508
Nothing.
We go about our lives.

45:43.574 --> 45:48.613
We go to school, we go to work,
we wait for him to make
the first move.

45:48.679 --> 45:53.284
Well, that's
a shit plan, Dad.
Well, we leave and he wins.

45:53.351 --> 45:56.121
- We stay and--
- And we're in it with him.

45:56.187 --> 45:59.657
And it's all up for grabs.

45:59.724 --> 46:01.927
I'm bettin' on us.

46:01.993 --> 46:04.095
What do you think?

46:05.596 --> 46:07.999
Yeah?

46:15.140 --> 46:19.377
Doug, there's someone
in your office waiting for you.
I told him to wait out here.

46:19.444 --> 46:23.181
But he insisted on going
inside. He said
he's a friend of yours.

46:23.248 --> 46:25.383
Thank you, Aubrey.
Mm-hmm.

46:38.663 --> 46:40.798
Dale?

46:43.301 --> 46:45.503
Pete.

46:45.570 --> 46:47.772
Guess you're probably surprised
to see me here, Wayne.

46:47.839 --> 46:49.908
A bit.

46:49.975 --> 46:54.312
Well, I was on my way
to the airport this morning,
but I had a little time to kill,

46:54.379 --> 46:57.648
and I thought I'd drop
by your house to thank you
for all your kindness.

46:57.715 --> 46:59.517
Huh.

46:59.584 --> 47:02.120
Only you folks weren't home.
But your neighbor was.

47:02.187 --> 47:04.155
Jim, I think his name is.

47:04.222 --> 47:07.592
Jim.
That's right.

47:07.658 --> 47:10.061
Lovely man.

47:10.128 --> 47:13.131
But, boy,
does he like to talk,

47:13.198 --> 47:18.169
especially
about his neighbors--
the Riches.

47:20.471 --> 47:23.241
So, Wayne,

47:23.308 --> 47:26.177
you and I both know
you're not Doug Rich.

47:27.178 --> 47:29.981
Though everyone here...

47:30.048 --> 47:33.051
seems to think you are.

47:33.118 --> 47:35.553
Which leads me
to a couple of questions.

47:35.620 --> 47:37.923
Who are you?

47:40.325 --> 47:44.062
And where the hell
is my best friend, Doug Rich?
