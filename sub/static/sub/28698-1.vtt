Jenny.

03:37.869 --> 03:38.914
[Nicole] What was that?

03:40.089 --> 03:41.917
You were all over the shop.

03:41.960 --> 03:43.875
Yeah, the joke shop.

[students laughing]

03:46.182 --> 03:48.053
[students] Whoo!

03:48.097 --> 03:49.707
Yeah?

03:49.751 --> 03:51.840
You wanna get up and say that
to my face, you little skank?

03:51.883 --> 03:54.364
[students jeer, laugh]

03:55.322 --> 03:58.455
[Adam] And that will do.

03:58.499 --> 03:59.587
[Nicole] She started it, sir.

03:59.630 --> 04:01.328
Do I look like I care
who started it?

04:01.371 --> 04:02.590
[school bell rings]

04:02.633 --> 04:03.852
[Adam] You may go.

04:05.332 --> 04:06.768
Except Sarah.

04:12.643 --> 04:16.430
Sarah, why are you here?

04:16.473 --> 04:18.519
- I don't know, sir.
- [Adam] And neither do I.

04:18.562 --> 04:20.172
I don't know why you bother
coming to my class.

04:21.043 --> 04:22.043
Oh, I get it.

04:23.219 --> 04:24.873
You were looking
for an easy ride.

04:24.916 --> 04:25.917
A doss, right?

04:26.483 --> 04:28.050
Performing Arts.

04:28.093 --> 04:31.183
For when Media Studies seems
a bit too much like hard work.

04:31.227 --> 04:32.315
Right?

04:32.359 --> 04:34.361
Wrong. Wrong.

04:34.404 --> 04:36.493
Because come hell or high water,
you will be going out

04:36.537 --> 04:38.060
onto that Theatre Royal stage.

04:38.103 --> 04:41.150
I don't care whether it's
to fart the national anthem.

04:41.193 --> 04:43.587
By next lesson, I want an act.

04:44.371 --> 04:45.676
All right?

04:45.720 --> 04:47.635
Now get out of my classroom.

04:48.549 --> 04:50.072
And close the door.

04:55.860 --> 04:57.471
[Marcus] What time
d'you call this?

04:58.254 --> 04:59.647
Sorry, all right?

04:59.690 --> 05:01.301
[Sarah] I had to see a man
about a dog.

05:01.344 --> 05:02.519
[Lucy] A dog?

05:02.563 --> 05:04.216
- We're getting a dog?
- [Sarah] Oh, sure.

05:04.260 --> 05:05.957
We're getting a few, actually.

05:06.001 --> 05:08.308
They're gonna wee and poo
all over the house

05:08.351 --> 05:09.787
and you're gonna have
to pick it up.

05:09.831 --> 05:11.093
[Lucy] Ugh. So rank.

05:11.136 --> 05:13.008
- Plop-plop!
- [Marcus] Yeah!

05:13.051 --> 05:14.139
Plop-plop!

05:14.836 --> 05:16.490
[all giggling]

05:18.579 --> 05:20.320
[Marcus] Oh, my.
[laughs]

05:23.323 --> 05:24.411
[Lucy] Give me your crayons.

05:26.587 --> 05:27.805
[Marcus] Why are you drawing?

05:33.158 --> 05:35.030
- [twins giggling]
- [switch clicking]

05:35.073 --> 05:36.074
Shit.

05:39.730 --> 05:41.471

- [Sarah groans]

05:46.433 --> 05:47.738
[giggling continues]

06:05.713 --> 06:07.758
- Ugh!
- [Lucy] They're hard.

06:08.890 --> 06:10.282
They're what we've got.

06:10.326 --> 06:12.241
- Well, we're not eating them!
- [Sarah] Hey.

06:13.242 --> 06:14.243
Shush.

06:18.073 --> 06:20.292
All right. Here's the deal.

06:20.336 --> 06:24.209
One, you eat your noodles
and you don't complain.

06:24.253 --> 06:26.560
Two, I'm gonna go to work,

06:26.603 --> 06:29.432
which I'm always
really late for.

06:29.476 --> 06:33.567
Three, you lot behave yourselves
and get ready for bed,

06:33.610 --> 06:34.829
and four...

06:36.700 --> 06:38.789
I'm gonna bring you back
some crisps.

06:38.833 --> 06:41.183
- Space Raiders!
- And chocolate.

06:41.226 --> 06:42.227
Do we have a deal?

07:59.261 --> 08:00.436
Are you Sarah?

08:02.656 --> 08:04.919
[Clive moaning]

08:08.966 --> 08:11.229
[moaning continues]

[pants]

08:22.502 --> 08:23.677
- Thank you.
- That way out.

08:40.432 --> 08:41.433
[Vince] Hey.

08:42.217 --> 08:43.827
Everything okay?

08:43.871 --> 08:45.133
Only, you...

08:45.176 --> 08:46.569
you weren't on the floor.

08:46.613 --> 08:49.006
Yeah. Sorry.
I was just taking out the bins.

08:50.791 --> 08:51.835
Sarah.

08:57.406 --> 09:00.627
Be really helpful
if you could do tomorrow.

09:01.366 --> 09:03.238
Jamie's sick.

09:03.281 --> 09:04.848
- [Sarah] Time?
- Two.

09:04.892 --> 09:06.894
I can't. I can't do before five.

09:06.937 --> 09:10.201
Well, I wouldn't ask
unless I was desperate.

09:10.245 --> 09:12.029
Well, I really can't.
I'm sorry, Vince.

09:12.073 --> 09:13.378
I can't do that time.

09:13.422 --> 09:14.858
[Vince clicks tongue]

09:14.902 --> 09:16.686
You know,
when I gave you this job,

09:16.730 --> 09:18.993
it was with a view
to you going full-time.

09:20.211 --> 09:21.604
And as it is,
you're hardly managing

09:21.648 --> 09:23.998
the part-time hours
I'm giving you.

09:24.041 --> 09:26.522
I mean, it just makes me think,
Sarah, that...

09:26.566 --> 09:28.219
I dunno, that you've got
somewhere else

09:28.263 --> 09:30.787
that's more important to you.

09:30.831 --> 09:32.702
I want this
to be a priority for you.

09:32.746 --> 09:33.877
The arcade.

09:33.921 --> 09:35.836
It is.
I really love this job, Vince.

09:35.879 --> 09:37.054
- [Vince] Yeah?
- Yeah.

09:37.968 --> 09:39.927
I mean...

09:39.970 --> 09:42.756
I'm just not feeling
that you want this job.

09:44.714 --> 09:46.237
All right.

09:46.281 --> 09:47.456
All right, fine. I'll do it.

09:48.152 --> 09:49.980
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

09:50.024 --> 09:52.200
- [Vince] You sure?
- Yeah.

09:52.243 --> 09:53.288
[Vince] Thank you, Sarah.

09:54.289 --> 09:55.899
It's much appreciated.

[sighs]

10:34.851 --> 10:35.852
[coins clink]

10:41.162 --> 10:42.816
- Give it me.
- Sure.

10:42.859 --> 10:44.078
I'll give it to you.

It's not just Kiwi Doug

11:42.266 --> 11:43.572
with his eyes on Sophie.

11:43.615 --> 11:45.356
[male on TV] Aww.

11:45.400 --> 11:48.229
[woman on TV]Best friend
Rueben is also trying his luck.

11:48.272 --> 11:50.622
[woman #2] Yeah, another one.
[shrieks]

11:50.666 --> 11:52.320
[Reuben] We learn to put
your shoulders on...

11:52.363 --> 11:54.278
[woman #1]
Okay, I got it, I got it.

11:54.322 --> 11:55.845
[Reuben] I'll teach you all how to fall.

11:55.889 --> 11:58.369
[Reuben mumbling]

11:58.413 --> 11:59.762
[woman #1]
That would have worked.

12:01.503 --> 12:03.853
[Reuben] Okay, let me get
your feet on your hips.

12:03.897 --> 12:05.812
[man #1] Arms.

12:05.855 --> 12:09.293
The girls, girls seem
to be drawn to my arms.

12:09.337 --> 12:11.643
- [woman #1] Close the door.
- [man #1] Who knows?

12:11.687 --> 12:13.994
- You and me.
- [woman]How are they doing it?

12:14.037 --> 12:17.649
This is what happens
when you do leg exercises.

12:17.693 --> 12:20.652
[woman #1]This is not working.
[giggles]

12:20.696 --> 12:21.784
[man #1]
We're bringing you here.

12:35.058 --> 12:36.799

12:37.931 --> 12:39.933
[approaching footsteps]

12:41.761 --> 12:43.284
- Hey! What you playing at?
- [Sarah] Come on.

12:43.327 --> 12:44.372
Shoes. Let's go.

12:45.286 --> 12:47.244
Jesus Christ.

12:48.637 --> 12:49.769
[Sarah sighs]

12:50.770 --> 12:51.771
Come on!

13:11.616 --> 13:12.617
Mom?

13:15.403 --> 13:16.404
Mom?

13:20.887 --> 13:22.018
Mom, I'm sorry.

13:24.368 --> 13:26.153
[Sarah] Work needs me
in early today.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.549
Please, can you pick up Marcus
and Lucy from school?

13:32.594 --> 13:33.595
[Karen] Mm.

13:35.205 --> 13:36.206
[Sarah] Is that okay?

13:37.251 --> 13:38.252
[Karen] Mm-hm.

13:43.213 --> 13:45.389
- Promise you'll be there?
- [Karen] Yes!

13:45.433 --> 13:46.738
Will you just close the door?

13:46.782 --> 13:47.870
Okay. Thank you very much.

13:51.004 --> 13:52.962
[Sarah] Mommy's picking you up
from school today.

13:53.006 --> 13:54.442
[Marcus] Why? Why aren't you?

13:54.485 --> 13:56.096
[Sarah] Because work,
that's why. Stand up, please.

13:56.139 --> 13:57.575
[Lucy] What about the bike?

13:57.619 --> 13:59.360
[Sarah]
I need the bike for work.

13:59.403 --> 14:02.624
So, yes, for once
in your tiny little lives,

14:02.667 --> 14:03.930
you're gonna have to walk.

14:03.973 --> 14:05.888
Now, come on, look sharp
or you're gonna be late.

14:09.631 --> 14:11.633
[school bell ringing]

14:13.722 --> 14:16.464
Ooof, crack a window.

14:16.507 --> 14:18.596
Smells like ghetto in here
all of a sudden.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.207
- [Leroy] Ooh.
- Bitch, say what?

14:20.250 --> 14:22.122
I said you smell like shit.

14:22.165 --> 14:23.384
Got a problem with that?

14:23.427 --> 14:27.257
No, no. See I can always shower,

14:27.301 --> 14:28.563
but you're always gonna have

14:28.606 --> 14:31.000
a face like a bulldog
shitting out a football.

14:31.044 --> 14:32.784
- [students] Whoo.
- Yo.

14:32.828 --> 14:34.003
Yo' watch yourself.

14:34.047 --> 14:37.006
Yo? Yo' watch myself or what?

14:37.050 --> 14:38.790
Or what?

14:38.834 --> 14:41.576
You and your crew
gonna come merk me, yeah?

14:41.619 --> 14:43.795
You're well street, you lot,

14:43.839 --> 14:45.972
- Fucking quality street.
- [students laugh]

14:46.015 --> 14:47.843
Yo, Sarah Taylor.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.627
Yo, Leroy.

14:49.671 --> 14:52.848
Do you know any other words
other than "Yo," Leroy?

14:52.892 --> 14:54.806
[Sam] Oh, leave it out, Sarah.

14:54.850 --> 14:56.199
We were trying to practice
before you came in

14:56.243 --> 14:57.984
- and started acting all hard.
- Practice?

14:58.027 --> 15:01.074
But you're already perfect
at taking away people's will

15:01.117 --> 15:04.773
to live with your stupid
fucking songs!

15:04.816 --> 15:09.038
And no, no,
doesn't matter how many times

15:09.082 --> 15:10.605
you play along with Jane,

15:10.648 --> 15:13.434
she's not gonna go out with you.

15:13.477 --> 15:16.741
She's too busy letting Dan
from Year 13

15:16.785 --> 15:18.830
finger her down the Lido,
aren't ya?

15:18.874 --> 15:20.963
[Jane] Fuck off, Sarah Taylor.
No-one even likes you.

15:21.007 --> 15:22.399
What, like I give a fuck, Jane.

15:22.443 --> 15:23.705
Like I give a fuck.

15:23.748 --> 15:25.185
- You're all--
- And scene...

15:26.838 --> 15:30.320
Yo, Sarah Taylor, outside. Now.

15:30.364 --> 15:31.495
She started it.

15:31.539 --> 15:33.628
Oh, did she?
How fascinating. Outside.

15:33.671 --> 15:36.848
- But, sir...
- When I say out, you go out.

15:36.892 --> 15:39.373
That's how
this little interaction works!

15:39.416 --> 15:40.940
Outside, now!

15:42.028 --> 15:44.813
[indistinct chatter]

15:44.856 --> 15:45.945
[door opens]

15:49.209 --> 15:50.210
Up.

15:53.561 --> 15:54.692
[Sarah sighs]

16:06.139 --> 16:07.618
She started it.

16:07.662 --> 16:08.880
She was saying...

16:11.057 --> 16:12.101
I let her have it.

16:12.928 --> 16:14.277
You did.

16:14.321 --> 16:15.626
You let them all have it.

16:17.628 --> 16:18.673
Did you enjoy it?

16:20.501 --> 16:22.024
[scoffs]

16:22.068 --> 16:23.199
So you do have a hobby.

16:24.461 --> 16:25.680
[Adam] You made them laugh.

16:27.073 --> 16:30.076
You almost made
some of them cry, too, but...

16:30.119 --> 16:31.599
mostly, you made them laugh.

16:34.341 --> 16:35.342
Stand-up.

16:37.126 --> 16:38.562
I am standing up.

16:39.824 --> 16:40.869
Your act.

16:40.912 --> 16:42.914
Stand-up, as in comedy.

16:43.872 --> 16:45.743
Two minutes. No swear words.

16:46.701 --> 16:47.919
Jokes?

16:47.963 --> 16:50.052
I want you to go figure out
what comedy is.

16:50.096 --> 16:52.098
- Oh. But, sir...
- [Adam] No buts.

16:52.881 --> 16:53.882
Here.

16:58.713 --> 16:59.714
[Adam] Pen?

17:01.933 --> 17:02.934
Here.

17:06.242 --> 17:07.678
Write these names down.

17:10.464 --> 17:11.638
Bill Hicks.

17:14.032 --> 17:15.208
Richard Pryor.

17:17.297 --> 17:18.385
George Carlin.

17:20.082 --> 17:21.040
Chris Rock.

17:22.519 --> 17:23.564
Frankie Boyle.

17:24.913 --> 17:26.567
- These guys are--
- All guys.

17:27.959 --> 17:30.919
Joan Rivers, Victoria Wood,
Katherine Ryan.

17:32.660 --> 17:33.704
So...

17:34.923 --> 17:36.403
You understand
what your homework is?

17:38.535 --> 17:39.797
Is that Sarah for yes?

17:42.583 --> 17:43.714
Good.

17:43.758 --> 17:44.846
All right.

17:44.889 --> 17:46.413
Off you go, then. Library.

18:01.471 --> 18:03.386
[Adam] Right then,
you horrible lot!

18:11.960 --> 18:15.572
[keyboard clacking]

18:21.187 --> 18:22.275
[mouse clicks]

18:26.844 --> 18:29.325
[audience applauding, cheering]

18:31.110 --> 18:33.373
- Hello, Glasgow.
- [audience cheering]

18:36.245 --> 18:38.117
[Frankie] Right, then.
How you doing, wee man?

18:38.160 --> 18:39.770
Are you a weird-looking
straight guy

18:39.814 --> 18:41.772
or a really weird-looking
gay guy?

18:41.816 --> 18:44.123
[audience laughing]

18:44.166 --> 18:46.386
I'd cum on your face
just to cover it up.

18:46.429 --> 18:49.128
[audience laughing]

18:49.171 --> 18:50.564
Depends how much you'd pay me.

18:50.607 --> 18:51.956
How much would I pay you?

18:52.000 --> 18:54.263
That was your fucking effort,
was it?

18:54.307 --> 18:56.570
When your mom gave birth,
she shat you out

18:56.613 --> 18:58.180
so she could leave
her pussy free

18:58.224 --> 18:59.834
for fucking the doctors.

18:59.877 --> 19:02.053
[giggles]

19:03.577 --> 19:05.666
[Frankie] You with the tattoos
down there, man?

19:05.709 --> 19:08.234
You look like the pad
I keep beside my phone.

19:08.277 --> 19:09.496
[Sarah laughing]

19:09.539 --> 19:10.932
[Frankie]You know what I mean?

19:10.975 --> 19:12.716
You look like you only
remember your own name

19:12.760 --> 19:14.283
because your mom's got it
tattooed on her lower back.

19:14.979 --> 19:16.459
[Sarah giggles]

19:16.503 --> 19:17.765
[Frankie] The Olympics,
I couldn't get tickets

19:17.808 --> 19:19.680
for the synchronized swimming,

19:19.723 --> 19:22.857
so instead, I watched a woman
drown through a kaleidoscope.

19:22.900 --> 19:24.424
[laughs]

19:27.122 --> 19:30.343
Some people say you should
never joke about rape.

19:30.386 --> 19:32.432
I probably shouldn't have
laughed through that, should I?

19:32.475 --> 19:34.347
Fucking hell.

19:34.390 --> 19:36.087
[Frankie] Some people say you
should never joke about rape,

19:36.131 --> 19:37.219
rape can never be funny.

19:37.263 --> 19:38.873
To those people I say,

19:38.916 --> 19:40.701
imagine Piers Morgan

19:40.744 --> 19:43.225
being raped by Lion-O
from ThunderCats.

19:43.269 --> 19:45.619
[laughs]

19:45.662 --> 19:47.969
[Frankie] Those are just
what-ifs, they're not real.

19:48.012 --> 19:49.405
It's been a pleasure
talking to you, Glasgow.

19:49.449 --> 19:51.102
Take care of yourselves,
all the best.

19:51.146 --> 19:53.714
[audience applauds, cheers]

19:57.413 --> 19:58.458
[sniffles]

19:58.501 --> 20:00.677
[cell phone buzzing]

20:10.426 --> 20:12.254
Oh, shit.

20:14.125 --> 20:16.127
[bike rattling]

20:32.231 --> 20:35.103
[Dudley] Sarah?
You're early today.

20:35.146 --> 20:36.365
[Sarah] Yeah.
I'll be back in a minute.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.064
You've just fired yourself.

20:41.283 --> 20:42.850
No, I haven't.

20:42.893 --> 20:44.330
No, I haven't, Vince.
I'm really sorry.

20:44.373 --> 20:46.070
Well, sorry's not good enough,
is it?

20:46.114 --> 20:47.289
I'm only a couple
of minutes late.

20:47.333 --> 20:48.508
Please don't fire me.

20:48.551 --> 20:50.771
Look. I know
it was short notice, Sarah,

20:50.814 --> 20:52.599
but you did say
that you'd be here.

20:52.642 --> 20:55.515
I'm really sorry.
I'm a couple of minutes late.

20:55.558 --> 20:57.691
Well, look, I've, uh...

20:57.734 --> 20:59.301
I've said my final word on it.

20:59.345 --> 21:00.694
The conversation's over.

21:02.348 --> 21:04.959
The conversation's over?

21:05.002 --> 21:07.091
[Sarah] The conversation's
right over now, is it?

21:09.790 --> 21:11.008
Fucking hell.

21:14.142 --> 21:16.013
It's a fucking arcade.

21:16.057 --> 21:18.755
What are you
Richard fucking Branson?

21:18.799 --> 21:23.238
No. You, you are a fat,
horrible cunt!

21:29.113 --> 21:31.681
And I'll have
that polo shirt back, please.

21:36.773 --> 21:37.774
[Dudley] Sarah!

21:40.211 --> 21:42.736
Go fuck yourself!

21:42.779 --> 21:44.172
And you?

21:44.215 --> 21:46.783
You can go fuck yourself
an' all.

21:47.958 --> 21:49.438
Wanker!

21:49.482 --> 21:50.744
Fuckin' wanker.

21:56.402 --> 21:57.664
[clanks]

22:05.759 --> 22:07.500
[TV presenter]
And our guests tonight

22:07.543 --> 22:11.025
know the value of everything
and the cost of nothing...

22:11.068 --> 22:12.766
Mom?

22:12.809 --> 22:14.289
...which is why we pay them
in Woolworths' vouchers.

22:14.333 --> 22:15.464
[Sarah] Mom?

22:15.508 --> 22:16.378
[TV presenter]
Joining me tonight

22:16.422 --> 22:17.640
are four money savvy comedians.

22:17.684 --> 22:20.382
A big round of applause
for Team A,

22:20.426 --> 22:23.167
- Ava Vidal and Steve Bugeja.
- Mm?

22:23.211 --> 22:24.821
[TV audience cheering]

22:24.865 --> 22:28.347
[TV presenter] And Team B,
Gráinne Maguire and Jeff Mirza.

22:28.390 --> 22:30.305
Where are Marcus and Lucy?

22:30.349 --> 22:32.612
- Mm?
- Mom, where are Marcus and Lucy?

22:33.613 --> 22:35.136
I thought they was with you.

22:40.228 --> 22:41.316
[door closes]

22:45.364 --> 22:47.540
[ominous music]

22:56.810 --> 22:58.812
[woman #1] Where is Sarah, then?
Does she have a phone number?

22:59.682 --> 23:01.249
- Sarah's here.
- Oh.

23:01.292 --> 23:02.685
I found them wandering around
on their own.

23:02.729 --> 23:04.121
They looked a little lost.

23:04.165 --> 23:06.820
- They're fine, thanks.
- Okay. Well, kids their age

23:06.863 --> 23:08.996
really shouldn't be wandering
about by themselves.

23:09.039 --> 23:09.997
Excuse me?

23:10.040 --> 23:11.302
Uh, I mean, you know,

23:11.346 --> 23:12.608
there are some people
around here who might--

23:12.652 --> 23:13.696
There are some people
around here

23:13.740 --> 23:14.958
who should mind
their own business.

23:16.307 --> 23:17.483
I'm only trying to help.

23:17.526 --> 23:19.398
Yeah, why don't you go try
somewhere else?

23:21.051 --> 23:22.096
[scoffs]

23:23.967 --> 23:26.317
- [girl #1] Daddy!
- [man #1] Hey. How're you doing?

23:27.362 --> 23:29.103
- Nice.
- [girl giggles]

23:31.453 --> 23:32.454
Wait, wait, wait.

23:38.068 --> 23:39.853
I'm sorry, all right?

23:39.896 --> 23:41.724
You said Mommy
was picking us up,

23:41.768 --> 23:43.073
and you made a deal.

23:43.117 --> 23:44.335
Everyone went.

23:44.379 --> 23:45.772
It was just us.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.776
Come on.

23:49.819 --> 23:52.256
You know how Mommy gets
when she's not feeling well.

23:53.432 --> 23:54.650
[Sarah] I'm here now.

23:56.522 --> 23:57.697
Come on, let's go.

23:58.828 --> 23:59.873
Come on.

23:59.916 --> 24:01.222
[Marcus] Can we get some chips?

24:02.049 --> 24:03.093
[Sarah] Yeah, sure.

24:03.137 --> 24:04.704
[Lucy] Really?

24:04.747 --> 24:07.054
Yeah, sure. Just give me a fiver
and I'll go grab 'em.

24:15.105 --> 24:17.456
[calm music]

24:38.041 --> 24:39.260
[sighs]

24:40.304 --> 24:42.785
[upbeat music playing]

24:50.184 --> 24:52.012
Hmm.

24:52.055 --> 24:55.885
The moves are fine,
as far as they go.

24:55.929 --> 24:58.888
Thing is, ladies and gentlemen,

24:58.932 --> 25:02.588
anyone can learn a routine
and keep time.

25:02.631 --> 25:06.069
But that's not
what we're about here.

25:06.113 --> 25:08.289
For this routine
to mean anything,

25:08.332 --> 25:11.074
for any of your acts
to mean anything,

25:11.118 --> 25:14.817
they need to come
from somewhere deep inside you.

25:14.861 --> 25:17.516
Don't just perform the routine.

25:17.559 --> 25:20.693
Inhabit the routine.

25:20.736 --> 25:23.565
Yeah, well, we actually worked
really hard on it.

25:23.609 --> 25:25.567
Oh.

25:25.611 --> 25:27.569
You worked really hard on it,
did you?

25:27.613 --> 25:29.484
And how many times
have you been through it?

25:31.051 --> 25:32.182
[sighs]

25:32.226 --> 25:34.881
Well, that's fine then.

25:34.924 --> 25:36.709
It's not as though
you want to be a dancer.

25:36.752 --> 25:39.407
It's not as though
you want to travel the world,

25:39.450 --> 25:42.584
connecting with people, places,
and culture through your art.

25:42.628 --> 25:45.631
Because if you did,
you would work at it.

25:46.414 --> 25:48.372
[Adam] Now, next lesson,

25:48.416 --> 25:51.419
I want you to bring me
your A game.

25:51.462 --> 25:53.682
Show me that you want it.

25:53.726 --> 25:56.642
And you'll need to find a name
for your crew.

25:56.685 --> 25:58.382
Something dynamic.

25:58.426 --> 26:01.690
Something that suggests
a bit of movement!

26:01.734 --> 26:03.518
How about "The Bowel Movements"?

26:03.562 --> 26:04.780
[all laughing]

26:04.824 --> 26:06.042
Hark.

26:06.086 --> 26:08.828
Does anyone else hear a comedian
in the room?

26:08.871 --> 26:09.959
[Adam] Okay, clear the floor,

26:10.003 --> 26:12.005
clear the floor,
ladies and gentlemen.

26:12.048 --> 26:17.097
I give you, all the way
from the Isle of Thanet,

26:17.140 --> 26:20.491
Sarah Taylor!

26:20.535 --> 26:21.841
[students clapping]

26:21.884 --> 26:23.103
[Adam] Come on, Sarah, quick.

26:23.146 --> 26:24.583
On the floor, on the floor,
on the floor.

26:26.106 --> 26:27.237
Once again.

26:27.281 --> 26:28.630
Give her a round of applause.

26:28.674 --> 26:33.548
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you, Sarah Taylor!

26:33.592 --> 26:35.594
[students clapping]

26:38.858 --> 26:40.381
This is the bit
where you say stuff.

26:40.424 --> 26:41.948
The stuff we agreed
you'd work on.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.395
Did you look up
any of those people I gave you?

26:56.397 --> 26:57.528
[Adam] And who did you watch?

26:58.617 --> 26:59.748
Boyle.

26:59.792 --> 27:01.228
Oh, good!

27:01.271 --> 27:03.665
Okay, so did you write
any material of your own?

27:07.408 --> 27:08.452
[Adam] Nothing?

27:13.196 --> 27:15.634
You haven't had time to write
so much as even a pun?

27:21.640 --> 27:22.641
Yeah.

27:23.598 --> 27:25.644
That's right. Soak it up, Sarah,

27:25.687 --> 27:27.384
because this is exactly
what it will be like

27:27.428 --> 27:29.212
at the Theatre Royal.

27:29.256 --> 27:30.910
Three hundred people
staring at you,

27:30.953 --> 27:32.868
and you,
staring at the floorboards.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.266
You just couldn't care less,
could you?

27:43.313 --> 27:44.793
Go on, Sarah.

27:44.837 --> 27:46.752
Off you go.

27:46.795 --> 27:48.710
You've clearly got nothing
to contribute here.

27:58.459 --> 28:00.026
[thuds]

28:02.463 --> 28:05.118
The fuck you looking at, eh?

28:08.599 --> 28:11.472
Damn right I couldn't care less,
motherfucker.

28:15.563 --> 28:17.608
You want jokes, Mr. Hale? Do ya?

28:17.652 --> 28:19.045
You want motherfucking jokes?

28:19.088 --> 28:21.134
All right.
I'll give you some jokes.

28:21.177 --> 28:23.179
How many drama teachers

28:23.223 --> 28:25.225
does it take to change
a light bulb?

28:30.534 --> 28:32.493
One to change the light bulb...

28:40.980 --> 28:42.459
One to...

28:42.503 --> 28:45.027
inhabit the light bulb.

28:51.730 --> 28:52.731
Okay.

28:53.557 --> 28:55.603
[tranquil music]

29:07.441 --> 29:11.271
Motherfucker wants jokes.

29:11.314 --> 29:13.142
I'll give you fucking jokes.

29:17.756 --> 29:20.367
[tranquil music]

29:22.325 --> 29:25.111
[laughs]

29:27.374 --> 29:28.767
[Marcus] What's so funny?

29:29.593 --> 29:30.769
Come here!

29:32.031 --> 29:33.162
Yeah, in a bit.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.993
[seagulls cawing]

29:45.000 --> 29:46.306
[Karen] Babies.

29:47.873 --> 29:50.179
Oh.
[chuckles]

30:07.370 --> 30:08.371
I'm sorry.

30:14.813 --> 30:15.901
They want us out?

30:17.816 --> 30:19.818
I don't know. I don't know.

30:25.214 --> 30:26.694
They're saying
we're three months behind.

30:26.737 --> 30:28.261
[Karen] Hmm.

30:28.304 --> 30:29.740
But that can't be possible.

30:29.784 --> 30:31.307
The housing goes straight
to them.

30:32.787 --> 30:34.180
[Sarah] They must have made
a mistake.

30:35.746 --> 30:37.705
You've been signing on,
haven't you?

30:37.748 --> 30:39.228
Yeah. I think so. Yeah.

You should've seen this place

47:24.406 --> 47:26.017
before I got my hands on it.

47:26.060 --> 47:27.757
Probably a fucking crack den.

47:28.367 --> 47:29.498
Smelt like one.

47:30.891 --> 47:32.937
It is nice though, huh?

47:34.852 --> 47:36.549
I specced the fit out myself.

47:40.118 --> 47:42.468
Sold for three-twenty.

47:44.862 --> 47:46.167
Guess how much it cost me.

47:48.604 --> 47:49.605
Don't know.

47:51.129 --> 47:52.130
Guess.

47:53.261 --> 47:54.393
I don't know.

47:54.436 --> 47:55.785
Come on, guess.

47:55.829 --> 47:56.874
- I don't know.
- [both chuckle]

47:57.962 --> 47:58.963
One-ten.

48:00.225 --> 48:01.400
That's how much.

48:02.270 --> 48:03.271
One-ten.

48:04.011 --> 48:06.492
It's fucking ludicrous.

48:06.535 --> 48:09.147
I mean, with the winnings
from this one,

48:09.190 --> 48:10.844
I'm going to buy a couple more.

48:10.888 --> 48:13.020
Then strip, renovate, repeat.

48:13.934 --> 48:15.283
That is how we do.

48:16.371 --> 48:17.982
- [glass clinks]
- Cheers.

48:26.773 --> 48:28.601
[slides glass on table]

48:36.783 --> 48:38.089
I'm so hot for you, babe.

48:39.264 --> 48:41.179
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

48:41.222 --> 48:43.050
- Hot for me, are you?
- Yeah.

48:44.312 --> 48:46.445
Things I want to do to you?

48:46.488 --> 48:49.317
You're gonna think you've won
the pleasure lottery in heaven.

48:49.361 --> 48:50.971
[both chuckle]

48:51.015 --> 48:52.625
Okay, we'll see about that.

48:55.802 --> 48:56.934
Let's just fuck.

48:59.066 --> 49:00.067
Or let's not.

49:00.763 --> 49:01.895
Ah, come on.

49:04.028 --> 49:05.159
Come on, what's wrong?

49:07.553 --> 49:08.554
Come on.

49:09.076 --> 49:10.121
What?

49:10.860 --> 49:12.079
The thing is...

49:13.559 --> 49:18.303
I'm not old enough
to win the pleasure lottery.

49:18.346 --> 49:21.001
I'm not even old enough
to play the National Lottery.

49:27.225 --> 49:28.400
[Martin sighs]

49:29.401 --> 49:31.359
[Martin chuckles]

49:31.403 --> 49:34.972
Actually, you know what? I...

49:35.015 --> 49:37.278
I don't even care, but...

49:37.322 --> 49:38.584
Just get out.

49:39.324 --> 49:40.586
Yeah?

49:40.629 --> 49:41.674
All right. I'll get out.

49:41.717 --> 49:43.023
- [Martin] All right. Now.
- Mm-hm.

49:44.633 --> 49:46.984
I might head on down
back to the club, actually.

49:47.027 --> 49:48.724
Yeah. Fucking go for it.

49:48.768 --> 49:51.118
[Sarah] See if anyone remembers
the guy in a cheap suit

49:51.162 --> 49:53.599
plying a 15-year old
with drinks all night.

49:55.209 --> 49:57.820
You know, grinding her
up and down on the dance floor.

49:57.864 --> 49:59.997
Hands all over her ass
and her tits.

50:01.737 --> 50:03.739
I'm not asking for much.

50:05.350 --> 50:07.134
What's in that money-fold
should do.

50:08.657 --> 50:09.702
Are you...

50:11.095 --> 50:12.574
Are you trying to blackmail me?

50:13.401 --> 50:15.012
You little cunt.

50:15.055 --> 50:16.274
[exhales]

50:16.317 --> 50:18.493
That's just how we do,
I'm afraid.

50:19.538 --> 50:21.018
[chuckles]

50:22.671 --> 50:26.371
You know, the police,
they won't help you.

50:26.414 --> 50:28.155
[Martin] We didn't
even fuckin'...

50:28.199 --> 50:30.636
There's nothing in there.
All right?

50:30.679 --> 50:32.246
Well, I don't mean the police.

50:34.335 --> 50:36.859
I think it's your lovely wife
who'd be most interested

50:36.903 --> 50:38.513
in what you've been
up to tonight.

50:40.124 --> 50:42.387
[Sarah] I don't think she'd be
very happy to find out

50:42.430 --> 50:43.562
that you're into girls

50:43.605 --> 50:45.825
who haven't even finished
their GCSEs.

50:45.868 --> 50:47.392
[blows air]

50:47.435 --> 50:49.437
[Sarah] It may even
make her think twice

50:49.481 --> 50:50.569
about having you
round her daughter.

50:50.612 --> 50:51.613
Shut up!

50:56.227 --> 50:57.532
I think it's in that pocket.

50:59.099 --> 51:01.014
- [Martin] Fucking take it.
- Okay.

51:01.884 --> 51:02.885
Get out.

51:03.756 --> 51:04.844
Get out.

51:04.887 --> 51:06.672
- Get the fuck out!
- [thuds]

51:06.715 --> 51:07.890
Get out!

51:07.934 --> 51:09.240
You fucking cunt!

51:47.104 --> 51:48.975
[Karen] Okay. Oh.

51:50.455 --> 51:53.197
You look... you look A-okay.

51:55.155 --> 51:56.330
Let's see.

51:56.374 --> 51:57.636
Oh, you've gone
and spilt something there.

51:57.679 --> 51:58.680
Hold on.

52:01.814 --> 52:03.120
There you go.

52:03.163 --> 52:04.164
Lovely.

52:04.208 --> 52:06.166
Why didn't you wake me up?

52:06.210 --> 52:08.777
Oh, you looked like
you could do with a lie-in.

52:08.821 --> 52:10.388
[Sarah] I need to get them ready
for school.

52:10.431 --> 52:13.173
No, my darling.
Look, they're all ready to go.

52:21.877 --> 52:22.922
You cleaned?

52:24.271 --> 52:27.056
Um, I'm sorry about last night.

52:27.100 --> 52:28.797
I was just, you know...

52:28.841 --> 52:30.364
I really wanted
to do something nice

52:30.408 --> 52:32.758
and then it, I just got all,
you know...

52:32.801 --> 52:33.802
[chuckles]

52:34.586 --> 52:35.630
It's okay.

52:36.849 --> 52:39.591
You're my angel, you know that?

52:39.634 --> 52:41.810
[Karen] I'd be nothing
without you. We all would be.

52:43.421 --> 52:45.423
Oh, by the way, uh, this came.

52:48.556 --> 52:50.341
We should open it really,
shouldn't we?

52:51.820 --> 52:53.213
Guess so. Pass it here.

53:03.615 --> 53:05.399
- [paper rips]
- Sarah!

53:06.835 --> 53:08.054
[Karen laughs]

53:08.097 --> 53:09.098
What?

53:12.885 --> 53:14.278
Oh, my god, what is that?

53:15.975 --> 53:17.455
Problem solved.

53:17.498 --> 53:19.239
[Karen] What? How?

53:19.283 --> 53:20.675
From work. I got an advance.

53:20.719 --> 53:22.895
Oh my god. How, how, how...

53:22.938 --> 53:24.679
How much is that?

53:24.723 --> 53:25.854
Two hundred and eighty.

53:28.030 --> 53:29.554
[giggles, shrieks]

53:29.597 --> 53:31.991
Come here!
[laughs]

53:32.034 --> 53:33.732
[Karen]
What did you say to them?

53:33.775 --> 53:35.081
This and that.

53:35.124 --> 53:36.822
It should be enough
to put them off, you know,

53:36.865 --> 53:37.997
while we find the rest, but...

53:38.040 --> 53:40.042
Ah, that's amazing, Sarah.

53:40.086 --> 53:42.697
Oi, you two, come
and give your sister a hug.

53:42.741 --> 53:45.961
Yes.
[chuckles]

53:46.005 --> 53:47.963
We're gonna be all right,
aren't we?

53:48.007 --> 53:50.792
We're always all right,
as long as we stick together.

53:50.836 --> 53:53.491
Yeah?
As long as we stay together.

53:53.534 --> 53:54.709
[Karen] You know
what we should do?

53:54.753 --> 53:55.797
We should celebrate.

53:55.841 --> 53:57.364
We need to have a party.

53:57.408 --> 53:59.845
- Well, we need to get to school.
- [gasps]

53:59.888 --> 54:01.542
- Shall we go to Dreamland?
- [twins gasp]

54:01.586 --> 54:05.024
- Shall we go to Dreamland?
- Mom.

54:05.067 --> 54:08.288
Dreamland, Dreamland, Dreamland!

54:08.332 --> 54:10.551
Dreamland, Dreamland, Dreamland!

54:10.595 --> 54:12.423
Mom, have you seen the prices
on that place?

54:12.466 --> 54:15.948
Oh, well, we ain't been
since it's reopened.

54:15.991 --> 54:17.123
Oh, come on.

54:17.776 --> 54:19.430
Couple of rides.

54:19.473 --> 54:20.474
For the kids.

54:22.128 --> 54:24.043
Please, Sarah.

54:24.086 --> 54:25.392
- [Lucy] Please, Sarah.
- [Marcus] Please.

54:25.436 --> 54:26.828
Please.

54:26.872 --> 54:28.961
- Please, Sarah.
- [twins] Please!

54:29.004 --> 54:30.441
- Oh, Sarah.
- [Lucy] Please!

54:30.484 --> 54:32.051
Sarah, please.

54:32.094 --> 54:34.314
- [Karen] Please, Sarah. Please.
- [twins] Sarah, please.

54:34.358 --> 54:37.230
- [Karen] We love you, Sarah.
- [twins] Please. Please.

54:39.188 --> 54:40.233
Whoo!

54:40.277 --> 54:41.974
One family ticket, please.

54:42.017 --> 54:43.280
[clerk]
There's no family tickets.

54:43.323 --> 54:44.542
The prices are there.

54:44.585 --> 54:45.804
[Karen] Well, it says
it's free to enter.

54:45.847 --> 54:47.196
[clerk]
Yeah, it's free to get in,

54:47.240 --> 54:49.329
but you need tokens
or wristbands for the rides.

54:49.373 --> 54:50.591
[Karen] Well, then,
we'll have just one adult

54:50.635 --> 54:51.853
and three children, please.

54:54.247 --> 54:56.293
Mom, we could just get
a few tokens.

54:58.556 --> 54:59.818
Come on, Sarah,
just give her the money.

54:59.861 --> 55:00.862
She's waiting.

55:05.693 --> 55:06.738
[Karen] Here you are.

55:09.175 --> 55:12.352
[Karen squeals, giggles]

55:12.396 --> 55:14.485
Lovely. Right, come on then.

55:14.528 --> 55:15.834
Oi, you two.

55:15.877 --> 55:18.271
- Come on, Sarah.
- [Lucy] Come on, Sarah!

55:18.315 --> 55:20.360
[Karen] Yeah, come on, Sarah.
[chuckles]

55:22.057 --> 55:23.668
[Karen] Wow!

55:23.711 --> 55:26.192
It's massive!
[chuckles]

55:26.671 --> 55:28.368
Whoo!

55:28.412 --> 55:30.544
Right, so what d'you want
to go on first, then?

55:30.588 --> 55:31.806
- [Marcus] Helter-skelter!
- [Lucy] Big wheel!

55:31.850 --> 55:33.591
You know what?
I think Sarah should decide.

55:33.634 --> 55:35.375
What do you wanna go on,
sweetheart?

55:36.507 --> 55:38.422
Uh, I dunno.

55:38.465 --> 55:41.381
How about the...

55:42.339 --> 55:43.949
- dodgems?
- [both gasp]

55:47.561 --> 55:50.042
[upbeat music]

55:51.826 --> 55:53.045
[laughing]

55:56.483 --> 55:58.180
[Karen] Are you okay, baby?

55:58.224 --> 55:59.225
Are you okay?

56:05.753 --> 56:07.929
Ride 'em, cowboy, ride 'em.

56:24.598 --> 56:26.818
[tranquil music]

56:57.283 --> 56:58.589
Right, who's hungry?

56:58.632 --> 57:00.460
- Who wants chips?
- [twins] Me, me, me!

57:00.504 --> 57:01.592
Uh, Mom, I...

57:03.158 --> 57:04.812
I'll get you some chips, yeah?

57:04.856 --> 57:05.987
[Karen] Come on, you two.

57:09.121 --> 57:10.209
[Adam] Sarah?

57:12.167 --> 57:14.866
I know you're there,
I can hear the music.

57:14.909 --> 57:16.694
Why aren't you in school?

57:16.737 --> 57:18.565
I'm gonna have to take this
to the Head.

57:22.569 --> 57:24.353
Uh, yeah. We have to go now.

57:24.397 --> 57:25.529
School called.

57:25.572 --> 57:27.139
I don't wanna.

57:27.182 --> 57:28.401
[Sarah] Uh, get up, please.

57:28.445 --> 57:29.924
We need to go to school
right now,

57:29.968 --> 57:32.100
- they just called.
- Right, listen.

57:32.144 --> 57:33.972
If we go on all the rides now,

57:34.015 --> 57:35.756
then that's nothing
to look forward to

57:35.800 --> 57:37.758
the next time
we come back, is it?

57:40.369 --> 57:44.156
Oh, looks like they don't want
to come back again.

57:44.199 --> 57:45.549
We do! We do!

57:45.592 --> 57:47.681
Well, pick your chips up
and come on.

57:49.640 --> 57:50.858
Thank you.

57:50.902 --> 57:52.381
Don't worry about it, babe.

57:52.425 --> 57:55.297
Listen, what you gonna do
about the rent?

57:55.341 --> 57:59.084
[Sarah] Uh, I'll give it
to the agency after school.

57:59.127 --> 58:00.825
Thing is, you can't be
skippin' off work.

58:00.868 --> 58:04.176
Not after they, you know,
given you that big advance.

58:04.219 --> 58:06.831
Um, I'll do it tomorrow, then.

58:06.874 --> 58:09.181
Why don't you let me do it?
'Cause I'm out and about now.

58:11.009 --> 58:12.097
Mom, I...

58:12.140 --> 58:13.881
No, listen. I know.

58:13.925 --> 58:16.493
I know that I've been
a bit up and down lately.

58:16.536 --> 58:18.059
But today's a really good day,

58:18.103 --> 58:20.671
and I just... I just want to be
of some help.

58:20.714 --> 58:21.976
Come on.

58:22.020 --> 58:24.196
Let me be more than
a speed bump.

58:28.983 --> 58:30.028
All right.

58:32.465 --> 58:33.684
[Karen] Good girl.

58:33.727 --> 58:35.773
Come here, you.
[smooches]

58:35.816 --> 58:37.470
I love ya.

58:37.514 --> 58:39.385
Right, come on, you.
Off to school.

58:40.429 --> 58:42.431
Better eat them chips up.

58:42.475 --> 58:44.172
[Sarah] Can we just hurry up?

58:45.391 --> 58:46.827
[Tommy]
...efforts to lose the card

58:46.871 --> 58:48.481
at about the middle of the deck.

58:48.525 --> 58:51.615
You should find that it always
makes its way straight back...

58:51.658 --> 58:52.833
to the top.

58:52.877 --> 58:55.575
That's good Tommy, really great.
[chuckles]

58:55.619 --> 58:57.272
And The Matrix called.

58:57.316 --> 58:59.013
Keanu Reeves wants
his coat back.

58:59.057 --> 59:00.319
[snickers]

59:00.362 --> 59:01.363
Okay.

59:03.409 --> 59:04.410
All right.

59:05.193 --> 59:06.238
Next.

59:09.502 --> 59:10.503
[Adam] Emma!

59:11.765 --> 59:13.071
Uh, one second, Emma.

59:15.987 --> 59:16.988
And?

59:18.076 --> 59:19.077
Now I'm here.

59:19.991 --> 59:21.166
Why?

59:21.209 --> 59:22.254
Dress rehearsal.

59:22.297 --> 59:23.385
Oh, wrong.

59:23.429 --> 59:24.604
If you were here
for the dress rehearsal,

59:24.648 --> 59:25.779
you'd have been here
at nine o'clock

59:25.823 --> 59:27.085
like everyone else.

59:27.128 --> 59:29.348
[Adam] Instead of which
you show up at midday.

59:29.391 --> 59:31.437
And you're out of the showcase.

59:31.480 --> 59:33.134
But I did what you asked.

59:33.178 --> 59:34.179
Look.

59:35.528 --> 59:37.399
I made a routine.

59:37.443 --> 59:39.227
[Adam] This isn't
about your routine.

59:39.271 --> 59:41.447
This is about showing
some respect.

59:41.490 --> 59:43.188
Come on, Mr. Hale.

59:44.537 --> 59:46.495
I've got some material here.

59:46.539 --> 59:48.628
I think it's really
gonna interest you.

59:48.672 --> 59:50.543
You show up three hours late,

59:50.587 --> 59:52.458
disrupt your classmates'
last rehearsal

59:52.501 --> 59:54.242
before they get out
on that Theatre Royal stage,

59:54.286 --> 59:55.635
and you still expect to go on?

59:57.594 --> 59:59.857
You've shown quite clearly
where your priorities lie.

01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:03.164
Do you think Frankie Boyle

01:00:03.208 --> 01:00:05.297
tits about
at a theme park all day

01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:07.952
before getting out on that stage
and killing it like that?

01:00:09.388 --> 01:00:12.347
No, because he's a craftsman.

01:00:12.391 --> 01:00:15.176
He channels his anger,
his frustration,

01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:18.266
his vulnerability,
and works them into his comedy.

01:00:18.876 --> 01:00:20.094
Work, Sarah.

01:00:20.138 --> 01:00:21.139
Dedication.

01:00:22.401 --> 01:00:23.794
But you're not a worker,
are you?

01:00:25.143 --> 01:00:26.492
I know more about work

01:00:26.535 --> 01:00:28.450
than Derren Brown-finger
up there.

01:00:30.191 --> 01:00:32.846
Call this fucking work?

01:00:32.890 --> 01:00:34.848
Titting around on stage

01:00:34.892 --> 01:00:38.025
with this bunch
of no-talent fuck buckets.

01:00:38.069 --> 01:00:40.245
Telling them
that they could go far

01:00:40.288 --> 01:00:42.551
if they just wished hard enough.

01:00:42.595 --> 01:00:44.292
You think your stupid showcase

01:00:44.336 --> 01:00:46.164
is gonna send us
around the world?

01:00:47.469 --> 01:00:49.384
It's a joke.

01:00:49.428 --> 01:00:52.126
This is Margate for fuck's sake.

01:00:52.170 --> 01:00:55.477
The only person
this shit matters to, is you.

01:00:55.521 --> 01:00:57.915
And you're old,
and you're stuck here.

01:01:01.745 --> 01:01:04.878
All you have is us,
and it is fuckin' tragic.

01:01:11.015 --> 01:01:12.451
Is something wrong, Sarah?

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:14.061
No.

01:01:14.583 --> 01:01:15.628
No.

01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:17.935
Everything's just fuckin' fine.

01:01:28.075 --> 01:01:30.599
Um, Emma.

01:01:30.643 --> 01:01:32.297
All of you. Five minutes.

01:01:42.046 --> 01:01:44.483
[loud thudding]

01:01:48.748 --> 01:01:49.880
Fuck it.

01:01:54.319 --> 01:01:56.582
[foreboding music]

01:02:06.810 --> 01:02:09.334
Think you're Simon
fucking Cowell?

01:02:10.335 --> 01:02:11.815
Fucking wanker.

01:02:16.167 --> 01:02:17.255
[Marcus] Sarah?

01:02:21.128 --> 01:02:22.129
[Lucy] Sarah.

01:02:23.957 --> 01:02:25.959
[indistinct chatter]

01:02:38.319 --> 01:02:41.758
[bike clanking]

01:02:42.846 --> 01:02:44.325
For fuck's sake.

01:02:54.292 --> 01:02:56.163
Well, come on, then. Let's go.

01:03:02.561 --> 01:03:03.997
[Marcus] Aren't we stopping?

01:03:21.319 --> 01:03:22.973
[woman on TV] ...space.

01:03:23.016 --> 01:03:24.409
There were obviously things
that were going to take place.

01:03:24.452 --> 01:03:26.019
[man #1 on TV]
So how many of these posters

01:03:26.063 --> 01:03:27.760
have you mailed out?

01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:29.457
[man #2]Ooh, we've...
you know, we haven't mailed them out.

01:03:29.501 --> 01:03:30.676
[Karen laughs]

01:03:30.719 --> 01:03:33.548
Are you all right, kids?
How was your day?

01:03:33.592 --> 01:03:35.333
[Karen] You wanna see
the bunch of jokers

01:03:35.376 --> 01:03:37.901
they've got on this show.
[chuckles]

01:03:37.944 --> 01:03:39.990
[Sarah] Whose van
is that outside?

01:03:40.033 --> 01:03:42.993
Oh, that's ours. I got it today.

01:03:43.036 --> 01:03:45.299
This bloke was practically
giving it away.

01:03:45.343 --> 01:03:46.387
It's cool, innit?

01:03:46.431 --> 01:03:47.475
We got a van?

01:03:47.519 --> 01:03:49.738
Yeah. We got a van, in't we?

01:03:49.782 --> 01:03:52.480
[Karen] Now we can go away
wherever we want.

01:03:52.524 --> 01:03:54.091
You know? Like a proper family.

01:03:55.701 --> 01:03:57.355
Please.

01:03:57.398 --> 01:03:59.052
Please tell me
you paid the rent.

01:03:59.096 --> 01:04:00.967
Ah, lighten up.

01:04:01.011 --> 01:04:02.403
Jesus Christ.

01:04:02.447 --> 01:04:04.405
[Karen] Stop being
such a Buzz Killington.

01:04:04.449 --> 01:04:05.972
You bought a fucking van!

01:04:06.016 --> 01:04:07.365
I bought it for us.

01:04:07.408 --> 01:04:09.367
You haven't even got
a license anymore.

01:04:09.410 --> 01:04:11.412
I still remember how to drive.

01:04:11.456 --> 01:04:13.501
I'm gonna drive youse all
to school, innit?

01:04:13.545 --> 01:04:14.894
It's only got two seats.

01:04:14.938 --> 01:04:16.635
It doesn't matter.
It's got a big boot.

01:04:16.678 --> 01:04:18.289
What, big enough for us
to move into

01:04:18.332 --> 01:04:20.726
when they repossess our house?

01:04:20.769 --> 01:04:22.641
Why have you gotta do this?

01:04:22.684 --> 01:04:26.210
Why do you have
to spoil everything?

01:04:26.253 --> 01:04:28.908
Can't you see how happy
the babies are?

01:04:28.952 --> 01:04:30.997
[Karen]
It's so fucking typical of you.

01:04:31.041 --> 01:04:32.042
Why?

01:04:35.828 --> 01:04:37.264
Where did it come from?

01:04:37.308 --> 01:04:38.439
[groans]

01:04:38.483 --> 01:04:40.137
You need to take it back,
Mom, please.

01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:42.313
Why are you such a drag?

01:04:42.356 --> 01:04:45.316
Ever since you were born,
you been a fucking drag.

01:04:45.359 --> 01:04:48.275
You been fucking stopping me
doing what I wanna do.

01:04:48.319 --> 01:04:50.712
Fucking no wonder I'm depressed.

01:04:50.756 --> 01:04:52.932
All right, then, Mom.
Just go upstairs, will ya?

01:04:52.976 --> 01:04:56.457
Fucking telling me what to do?
Are you?

01:04:56.501 --> 01:04:59.939
You fucking telling me
what to do?

01:04:59.983 --> 01:05:01.245
Just go upstairs.

01:05:01.288 --> 01:05:02.637
- [Karen] Are you the boss?
- Go upstairs, Mom.

01:05:02.681 --> 01:05:05.379
You're in charge, are you?
You in charge?

01:05:05.423 --> 01:05:07.773
Are you the boss? Hm?

01:05:07.816 --> 01:05:09.818
Are you the big fucking boss?

01:05:09.862 --> 01:05:11.516
Marcus, Lucy, go upstairs.

01:05:11.559 --> 01:05:13.779
[Karen] Oh, yeah.
Go on, babies. Go on.

01:05:13.822 --> 01:05:16.303
Go on upstairs. Sarah says so.

01:05:16.347 --> 01:05:18.349
Fucking she's
in charge now, yeah.

01:05:18.392 --> 01:05:19.959
Are you the big fucking boss?

01:05:20.003 --> 01:05:21.004
Fuck you!

01:05:21.047 --> 01:05:22.875
Fuck you! Fuck all of youse.

01:05:22.919 --> 01:05:25.443
I'm fucking off out of here,
you little bunch of cunts.

01:05:25.486 --> 01:05:26.574
[door slams]

01:05:31.623 --> 01:05:33.625
[engine stars]

01:05:35.496 --> 01:05:37.629
[car pulls away]

01:05:40.414 --> 01:05:41.720
[Marcus] Where's Mommy gone?

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:45.637
[Sarah] She'll be back
when she's calmed down.

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:47.204
That's not what she said.

01:05:47.247 --> 01:05:49.771
Well, sometimes Mommy says
things she doesn't mean.

01:05:49.815 --> 01:05:51.469
But I want Mommy back.

01:05:51.512 --> 01:05:53.427
You're stuck with me, okay?

01:05:53.471 --> 01:05:54.776
But I want Mommy.

01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:58.041
Well, she's fucked off, okay?

01:05:58.084 --> 01:06:01.479
So you're stuck with me,
and I'm stuck with you.

01:06:01.522 --> 01:06:03.524
Now go to fucking sleep.

01:06:08.094 --> 01:06:09.313
[doorbell rings]

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:20.802
[knocking on door]

01:06:20.846 --> 01:06:22.195
[woman #1] Ms. Taylor?

01:06:22.239 --> 01:06:23.283
Karen?

01:06:23.327 --> 01:06:24.937
Are you in there?

01:06:24.981 --> 01:06:26.678
We need to talk to you.

01:06:26.721 --> 01:06:28.419
Can you open the door, please?

01:06:31.683 --> 01:06:33.467
We're only here to help you.

01:06:40.648 --> 01:06:41.998
[in soft voice]
[Sarah] Get down there.

01:06:42.041 --> 01:06:43.825
- What's happening?
- [Sarah] Just be quiet.

01:06:46.741 --> 01:06:48.961
[woman #1] It's important
we speak to you.

01:06:49.005 --> 01:06:51.485
We understand
you're not very well.

01:06:51.529 --> 01:06:53.052
If you're in there,
open the door.

01:07:27.173 --> 01:07:29.175
[water running]

01:07:39.142 --> 01:07:40.143
[electricity powers down]

01:08:11.261 --> 01:08:12.653
[Sarah] It's a big day
for you today.

01:08:13.219 --> 01:08:14.873
Why?

01:08:14.916 --> 01:08:17.049
Well, I was thinking.

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:19.225
'Cause you're all big,
and grown up, and all of that,

01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:22.054
that maybe today, you get
to walk home by yourself.

01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:23.403
I don't want to.

01:08:23.447 --> 01:08:24.926
Marcus, you've got to start
growing up.

01:08:24.970 --> 01:08:26.537
Well, I don't want to!

01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:28.452
You'll be fine, okay?
You've got each other.

01:08:30.106 --> 01:08:31.149
[Sarah] Come on.

01:08:32.542 --> 01:08:33.674
Get up, please.

01:08:34.501 --> 01:08:35.894
Get up now!

01:08:38.505 --> 01:08:39.898
Come on, hurry up.

01:08:41.291 --> 01:08:42.335
Wait.

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:44.511
[keys jangle]

01:08:46.513 --> 01:08:48.211
[Sarah] Right, I'll see you
at home later.

01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:02.399
[arcade machine beeping]

01:09:08.535 --> 01:09:09.536
[knocks on door]

01:09:13.279 --> 01:09:15.063
What do you want?

01:09:15.107 --> 01:09:16.500
I want my job back.

01:09:19.328 --> 01:09:20.895
I'm ready to go full-time.

01:09:24.072 --> 01:09:26.031
What you said to me
the other day?

01:09:30.514 --> 01:09:32.211
Sorry.

01:09:32.255 --> 01:09:34.212
See...
[clears throat]

01:09:34.256 --> 01:09:36.215
It's that attitude,
isn't it, Sarah?

01:09:36.259 --> 01:09:38.826
- I mean, I just don't--
- Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:41.307
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Vince.

01:09:41.350 --> 01:09:43.048
Please. I need this job.

01:09:44.267 --> 01:09:46.138
It won't happen again,
I promise.

01:09:48.009 --> 01:09:49.185
Please, Vince.

01:09:56.409 --> 01:09:58.106
[sighs]

01:09:58.150 --> 01:10:01.414
All right, you start work now.

01:10:01.458 --> 01:10:04.635
You work from noon to close
every day.

01:10:06.027 --> 01:10:07.028
Okay.

01:10:10.815 --> 01:10:12.686
How much?

01:10:12.730 --> 01:10:14.558
Christ. Same rate as before.

01:10:14.601 --> 01:10:16.299
But I'm working full-time now.

01:10:20.303 --> 01:10:21.304
Fine.

01:10:23.044 --> 01:10:24.045
Fine.

01:10:48.374 --> 01:10:49.680
[Dudley] Hello, stranger.

01:10:51.334 --> 01:10:52.857
I thought you'd quit.

01:10:55.338 --> 01:10:56.774
Well, you know,

01:10:56.817 --> 01:10:58.471
couldn't keep away.

01:10:58.515 --> 01:11:01.300
Mmm, do you... do you suppose
you've got a break coming up?

01:11:01.344 --> 01:11:02.910
You know.

01:11:02.954 --> 01:11:04.260
Vince is on the floor.

01:11:05.609 --> 01:11:06.740
Five minutes?

01:11:06.784 --> 01:11:09.700
I told you,
Vince is on the floor.

01:11:09.743 --> 01:11:11.702
[Sarah] Just play the machines
a bit. He'll be gone soon.

01:11:15.096 --> 01:11:17.360
Look, I... I've got to get home.

01:11:17.403 --> 01:11:18.709
- I've got to get back.
- I can't.

01:11:18.752 --> 01:11:20.014
Just wait a minute, would ya?

01:11:24.497 --> 01:11:25.846
[Dudley] I've missed you.

01:11:28.936 --> 01:11:31.025
Fine, uh, it...
[clears throat]

01:11:31.069 --> 01:11:32.288
[Dudley] Forty quid?

01:11:36.074 --> 01:11:37.075
Come on.

01:11:39.947 --> 01:11:43.560
[panting]

01:11:46.563 --> 01:11:47.564
[both gasp]

01:11:50.871 --> 01:11:53.091
[Vince]
I can't believe you, Sarah!

01:11:53.134 --> 01:11:55.267
On my business premises!

01:11:55.311 --> 01:11:56.616
I'm gonna have
to call in the police.

01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:58.401
- I'm--
- Oh, please don't, Vince.

01:11:58.444 --> 01:11:59.489
It's soliciting!

01:11:59.532 --> 01:12:01.752
On my business premises!

01:12:01.795 --> 01:12:04.407
Any idea what they can do to me?

01:12:04.450 --> 01:12:05.669
[Sarah] Please, Vince, don't.

01:12:05.712 --> 01:12:07.018
You've left me no option!

01:12:07.061 --> 01:12:10.195
But I had to do it, Vince!
I had to do it.

01:12:10.238 --> 01:12:12.328
I'm the only one
bringing in any money.

01:12:14.547 --> 01:12:15.635
I'm sorry.

01:12:16.375 --> 01:12:18.769
I'm so, so sorry.

01:12:18.812 --> 01:12:20.597
I did not mean
to cause you any trouble.

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:21.815
You've got to believe me.

01:12:21.859 --> 01:12:23.991
I did not mean
to cause you any trouble.

01:12:24.427 --> 01:12:25.428
Really.

01:12:26.298 --> 01:12:28.605
Yep, you're in a corner.

01:12:28.648 --> 01:12:32.217
But I'm sorry, you are
in an even bigger corner now.

01:12:33.131 --> 01:12:34.480
God, please don't, Vince.

01:12:34.524 --> 01:12:36.439
Please.

01:12:36.482 --> 01:12:39.311
Surely, there must be something
that I can do for you.

01:12:40.747 --> 01:12:42.445
To make you forget,
I don't know.

01:12:44.185 --> 01:12:45.448
[female dispatcher]
1-0-1 Police.

01:12:45.491 --> 01:12:46.710
Please hold a moment.

01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:52.716
Hello. 1-0-1 Police.

01:12:52.759 --> 01:12:55.283
- How can I direct your call?
- Come here.

01:12:55.327 --> 01:12:56.328
[female dispatcher] Hello?

01:12:57.677 --> 01:12:59.375
Are you there?

01:12:59.418 --> 01:13:00.463
Can you talk?

01:13:02.073 --> 01:13:03.117
How can I help...

01:13:04.554 --> 01:13:05.859
It's no big deal, really.

01:13:12.083 --> 01:13:14.477
[sighs deeply]

01:13:18.481 --> 01:13:19.525
All right.

01:13:21.484 --> 01:13:22.528
[lock clicks]

01:13:30.449 --> 01:13:31.624
[Vince] Um...

01:13:33.147 --> 01:13:34.584
Well, um...

01:13:35.976 --> 01:13:38.326
Do you or do, do I?

01:13:40.328 --> 01:13:42.330
[belt buckle clinking]

01:13:54.908 --> 01:13:56.388

01:14:00.871 --> 01:14:03.264
Yeah.
[pants]

01:14:05.832 --> 01:14:07.007
Come on.

01:14:07.617 --> 01:14:08.922
[Vince pants]

01:14:20.934 --> 01:14:23.023

That's nice.

01:14:23.546 --> 01:14:25.243
[pants]

01:14:27.158 --> 01:14:29.465
Mm, yeah.

01:14:29.508 --> 01:14:32.598
Ooh. That's... that's nice.

01:14:32.642 --> 01:14:34.339
- What are you doing?
- [Vince] Come on.

01:14:34.382 --> 01:14:35.906
- What are you doing?
- [loud thud]

01:14:35.949 --> 01:14:36.994
Come on then, Sarah.

01:14:37.037 --> 01:14:38.648
[Sarah] Vince! No!

01:14:38.691 --> 01:14:39.866
Now...

01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:40.954
[Sarah] Stop it!

01:14:40.998 --> 01:14:42.173
[Vince] I'm not going
to be long.

01:14:42.216 --> 01:14:43.566
[Sarah] What are you doing?
Get off me!

01:14:43.609 --> 01:14:45.785
- Now, I'm not going to do much.
- [Sarah] Stop it!

01:14:45.829 --> 01:14:48.658
[shushes]
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

01:14:50.442 --> 01:14:52.096
[both grunt]

01:14:52.139 --> 01:14:54.011
[Vince moaning]

01:14:54.054 --> 01:14:56.883
[whimpering]
[Sarah] Stop it!

01:15:03.411 --> 01:15:05.805
[arcade machines trilling]

01:15:25.825 --> 01:15:27.827

01:17:04.881 --> 01:17:05.882
[Marcus] Sarah.

01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:34.475
[door opens]

01:17:39.437 --> 01:17:40.960
[Karen] All right, baby.

01:17:43.441 --> 01:17:45.443
[approaching footsteps]

01:17:47.837 --> 01:17:49.621
[Karen] I'm sorry about before.

01:17:51.710 --> 01:17:54.539
I know I probably said
some things that were like...

01:17:56.236 --> 01:17:58.717
It's like when I remember it,

01:17:58.761 --> 01:18:01.764
it's like it wasn't me
that said it, but...

01:18:01.807 --> 01:18:03.679
but then I know that it was.

01:18:07.508 --> 01:18:09.075
But I'm gonna get better.

01:18:09.119 --> 01:18:11.425
In fact, I've started. Look.

01:18:11.469 --> 01:18:12.992
I took the van back,

01:18:13.036 --> 01:18:15.168
and the bloke gave me
a hundred quid.

01:18:15.212 --> 01:18:17.040
[Sarah] A hundred quid
won't do it.

01:18:17.083 --> 01:18:19.564
[Karen] Well, it's a start,
though, innit?

01:18:19.607 --> 01:18:23.263
We'll find the rest,
if we're smart.

01:18:23.307 --> 01:18:26.266
- What, with your job.
- [Sarah] I lost my job.

01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:29.139
[Karen] Well, we'll sell
some stuff, then.

01:18:29.182 --> 01:18:30.662
[Sarah]
We haven't got any stuff.

01:18:30.706 --> 01:18:31.924
[Karen] Of course we have.

01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:33.709
Got the couch.

01:18:34.492 --> 01:18:35.711
Got the microwave.

01:18:37.713 --> 01:18:39.758
Mm? Got the babies.

01:18:39.802 --> 01:18:41.064
They're a matching pair.

01:18:41.107 --> 01:18:42.718
- [Sarah] Mom, stop it.
- [Karen chuckles]

01:18:43.849 --> 01:18:45.416
[Karen] Ah, I can get a job.

01:18:45.459 --> 01:18:46.765
[Sarah] Mom.

01:18:46.809 --> 01:18:48.114
[Karen] Look, I know
what you're going to say.

01:18:48.158 --> 01:18:50.595
I know exactly
what you're going to say.

01:18:50.638 --> 01:18:54.077
I'll even get a job
as a speed bump if I have to.

01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:57.210
Stack shelves, fry fish.

01:18:57.254 --> 01:18:59.212
You can get another job, too.

01:18:59.256 --> 01:19:01.084
Or you could do a course, maybe.

01:19:01.127 --> 01:19:02.825
I could do a course.

01:19:02.868 --> 01:19:05.828
And then, we can have the house
exactly as we want it.

01:19:05.871 --> 01:19:07.264
We can even have some treats,

01:19:07.307 --> 01:19:09.309
what, with the money
you earn on the side.

01:19:09.353 --> 01:19:11.050
Then we'll go back to Dreamland.

01:19:12.660 --> 01:19:14.053
What did you just say?

01:19:14.097 --> 01:19:16.839
We can go back to Dreamland
and go on all the rides.

01:19:16.882 --> 01:19:19.232
Once we've got back up
on our feet.

01:19:19.276 --> 01:19:20.843
No, about what I earn
on the side.

01:19:20.886 --> 01:19:22.148
[stammers]
Oh, you know, well,

01:19:22.192 --> 01:19:25.369
anything extra
that you can get your hands on.

01:19:25.412 --> 01:19:26.413
[chuckles]

01:19:30.026 --> 01:19:31.027
You knew.

01:19:32.942 --> 01:19:35.683
You fucking knew.

01:19:35.727 --> 01:19:38.382
[stuttering]
I know... I don't know anything.

01:19:38.425 --> 01:19:40.950
- That money, the extra.
- [Karen] What...

01:19:42.212 --> 01:19:43.779
No...

01:19:43.822 --> 01:19:45.389
No, I don't know anything.

01:19:45.432 --> 01:19:47.173
You know what my head's like.

01:19:47.217 --> 01:19:50.524
- Things just fall out.
- [Sarah] No.

01:19:50.568 --> 01:19:53.832
You knew, and you didn't
say anything, did ya?

01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:56.487
You didn't stop it!

01:19:56.530 --> 01:19:57.705
[Karen] Stop what?

01:19:57.749 --> 01:19:59.707
You said you earned it,
through work.

01:19:59.751 --> 01:20:01.187
[stuttering]
What?

01:20:01.231 --> 01:20:03.189
Am I supposed to question ya?

01:20:03.233 --> 01:20:05.713
- You're my fucking mother!
- [Karen] Yeah, well, what?

01:20:05.757 --> 01:20:07.846
Am I... Am I just supposed
to let you all starve, is it?

01:20:07.890 --> 01:20:09.630
Just 'cause I hear
some people talk?

01:20:09.674 --> 01:20:10.936
Fuck 'em.

01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:12.720
They've been talking about me
since forever.

01:20:12.764 --> 01:20:14.157
I don't fucking care.

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:15.680
I don't care, yeah?

01:20:15.723 --> 01:20:17.334
They don't know us.

01:20:17.377 --> 01:20:19.292
They don't know us,
we're family.

01:20:19.336 --> 01:20:20.467
They don't understand.

01:20:20.511 --> 01:20:22.078
You have to do
what you have to do

01:20:22.121 --> 01:20:24.384
- for your family.
- No.

01:20:24.428 --> 01:20:26.865
No, I do what I have to do.

01:20:26.909 --> 01:20:29.868
If we were a family,
then you'd be a proper mother,

01:20:29.912 --> 01:20:31.087
and I wouldn't
have had to go to...

01:20:31.130 --> 01:20:32.305
Baby, please.

01:20:32.349 --> 01:20:33.741
I'm not your fucking baby!

01:20:33.785 --> 01:20:36.135
I don't know why you're
fucking blaming me for this.

01:20:37.049 --> 01:20:39.573
I'm sorry, all right? I'm...

01:20:39.617 --> 01:20:41.184
I'm sorry that I'm sick.

01:20:42.707 --> 01:20:44.840
Not everything
is about you, Mom.

01:20:46.145 --> 01:20:48.844
What about Marcus and Lucy?

01:20:49.801 --> 01:20:50.846
Yeah?

01:20:51.455 --> 01:20:52.543
What about me?

01:20:53.109 --> 01:20:54.414
What about you?

01:20:55.720 --> 01:20:58.462
You're, you're our lifeline,
you are.

01:21:00.246 --> 01:21:01.334
You know...

01:21:02.727 --> 01:21:03.946
for once in my life,

01:21:03.989 --> 01:21:06.470
I found something
I really liked doing.

01:21:08.298 --> 01:21:09.777
Something that wasn't
the council.

01:21:10.996 --> 01:21:13.912
Or the fucking electric meter.

01:21:13.956 --> 01:21:15.696
Something that wasn't about you.

01:21:18.177 --> 01:21:21.659
Mm. Well, what was it?

01:21:25.402 --> 01:21:26.490
It's at school.

01:21:26.533 --> 01:21:28.100
At school? That's great.

01:21:29.493 --> 01:21:31.234
Our showcase was tonight.

01:21:31.277 --> 01:21:32.496
Mr. Hale wanted...

01:21:35.238 --> 01:21:36.892
He said I had potential.

01:21:43.376 --> 01:21:44.812
Got me to do stand-up.

01:21:47.641 --> 01:21:49.252
Stand-up?

01:21:49.295 --> 01:21:50.340
What, like...

01:21:52.603 --> 01:21:54.039
[giggles]

01:21:54.997 --> 01:21:57.608
What, like comedy?
[laughs]

01:22:02.004 --> 01:22:03.005
[Karen] I'm sorry.

01:22:04.441 --> 01:22:06.965
[cackles]
Oh, my god, I'm sorry!

01:22:07.009 --> 01:22:08.619
I'm sorry, it's just...

01:22:08.662 --> 01:22:10.186
I don't mean it like...

01:22:11.578 --> 01:22:14.538
Sorry, you just took me
by surprise, that's all.

01:22:15.582 --> 01:22:18.977
Fucking hell! Comedy? You?

01:22:19.021 --> 01:22:21.501
What have you got
to tell jokes about?

01:22:21.545 --> 01:22:22.938
[laughing]

01:22:22.981 --> 01:22:24.156
Oh, fucking hell.

01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:26.506
Hey, no, no, no. I'm sorry.

01:22:26.550 --> 01:22:29.248
I'm sorry,
I'm not laughing at ya.

01:22:29.292 --> 01:22:30.597
Well, actually, I suppose

01:22:30.641 --> 01:22:32.164
that would be quite
a good thing, wouldn't it?

01:22:32.208 --> 01:22:34.601
Me laughing at ya?
[laughing]

01:22:34.645 --> 01:22:35.951
Why are you like this?

01:22:35.994 --> 01:22:38.388
[Karen] Sarah, come on,
lighten up.

01:22:38.431 --> 01:22:40.390
I thought you were meant
to be a comedian.

01:22:40.433 --> 01:22:42.435
[laughing]

01:22:44.133 --> 01:22:47.136
Hey, hey, hey, come on, come on.

01:22:47.179 --> 01:22:49.399
[Karen] Oi,
where you off to, Peter Kay?

01:22:49.442 --> 01:22:51.314
To tell some fucking jokes!

01:22:52.663 --> 01:22:55.535
[singsong]
[Karen] Peter, Peter Kay.

01:22:55.579 --> 01:22:57.798
[Karen laughing]

01:23:03.413 --> 01:23:04.631
[Sarah] Fucking thing!

01:24:48.170 --> 01:24:49.171
Sarah.

01:24:59.616 --> 01:25:01.531
You all right, Margate?

01:25:01.574 --> 01:25:02.967
[audience] Yeah.

01:25:03.010 --> 01:25:05.012
Enjoy that bit
of a singsong, did ya?

01:25:05.056 --> 01:25:06.362
[audience] Yeah.

01:25:10.975 --> 01:25:14.500
Margate, Margate, Margate.

01:25:14.544 --> 01:25:16.850
Bloke the other day told me
that Margate's gonna be

01:25:16.894 --> 01:25:18.722
the new Brighton.

01:25:18.765 --> 01:25:20.854
Shoreditch by the fucking sea.

01:25:20.898 --> 01:25:22.334
[audience giggling]

01:25:22.378 --> 01:25:23.857
DFLs they call 'em.

01:25:23.901 --> 01:25:25.511
You know, "Down from London."

01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:28.166
You can spot them,

01:25:28.210 --> 01:25:30.168
because they've still got
all their teeth.

01:25:30.212 --> 01:25:32.170
[laughter]

01:25:32.214 --> 01:25:34.825
Give it a few years, Margate,
give it a few years,

01:25:34.868 --> 01:25:38.524
and they'll be necking the cider
outside the Magistrates' Court,

01:25:38.568 --> 01:25:41.440
and yelling at the traffic
just like the rest of us.

01:25:41.484 --> 01:25:43.921
[audience laughing]

01:25:46.010 --> 01:25:47.577
But it's changing,
isn't it, Margate?

01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:48.795
It's changing.

01:25:48.839 --> 01:25:50.797
I mean, we've got
the Turner Contemporary.

01:25:50.841 --> 01:25:52.538
That's lovely, isn't it?

01:25:52.582 --> 01:25:54.149
I mean it's hard to believe

01:25:54.192 --> 01:25:57.021
that Tina Turner had time to do
all of them paintings.

01:25:57.064 --> 01:25:59.066
[audience groans, chuckles]

01:25:59.110 --> 01:26:02.853
Oh, come on, Margate.

01:26:02.896 --> 01:26:04.942
I thought of all the jokes
in my routine,

01:26:04.985 --> 01:26:07.031
that one was simply the best.

01:26:07.074 --> 01:26:09.076
[audience laughing]

01:26:11.470 --> 01:26:12.645
[Sarah sighs]

01:26:12.689 --> 01:26:15.605
[Sarah] So welcome
to our little showcase.

01:26:15.648 --> 01:26:19.043
Mr. Hale put it all together
by himself, didn't ya?

01:26:19.086 --> 01:26:21.045
You know what,
I think we should give Mr. Hale

01:26:21.088 --> 01:26:22.438
a big round of applause.

01:26:22.481 --> 01:26:26.355
Give it up
for Mr. Hale, everyone!

01:26:26.398 --> 01:26:28.226
[cheering, applauding]

01:26:28.270 --> 01:26:30.097
Yeah! Yeah.

01:26:32.187 --> 01:26:34.406
He has been on at us all year.

01:26:34.450 --> 01:26:35.842
Trying to make us work hard,

01:26:35.886 --> 01:26:39.585
so we don't look foolish
on this Theatre Royal stage.

01:26:42.501 --> 01:26:44.416
And he turns up in that jacket?

01:26:44.460 --> 01:26:46.418
[audience laughing]

01:26:48.899 --> 01:26:51.162
Thing about drama teachers
is that they really--

01:26:51.206 --> 01:26:52.207
[Daryl] Slag!

01:26:57.299 --> 01:26:59.431
Quiet in the cheap seats.

01:26:59.475 --> 01:27:02.304
Well, they're all cheap in here,
aren't they, Margate?

01:27:02.347 --> 01:27:04.175
[Daryl] You're cheap,
you fucking slag!

01:27:04.219 --> 01:27:05.611
Ow!

01:27:05.655 --> 01:27:08.005
Bring...
Bring the house lights up.

01:27:08.048 --> 01:27:09.093
Who threw that?

01:27:11.661 --> 01:27:13.184
[Adam] I said who threw that?

01:27:28.025 --> 01:27:29.113
Come on, Sarah.

01:27:31.246 --> 01:27:33.596
[Daryl] That's for you
to fuck off and not come back!

01:27:33.639 --> 01:27:35.641
[audience groaning]

01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:58.185
I'm not surprised
you're throwing money away.

01:27:58.229 --> 01:28:01.101
You could afford to lose
a few pounds, you fat cunt.

01:28:01.145 --> 01:28:03.582
[audience laughing, applauding]

01:28:03.626 --> 01:28:05.280
[Sarah] Now look at his face.

01:28:05.323 --> 01:28:07.325
Look at his face, Margate.

01:28:08.935 --> 01:28:10.850
You always looked like that?

01:28:10.894 --> 01:28:12.112
Or did the wind change

01:28:12.156 --> 01:28:14.463
when your mom caught you
banging your sister?

01:28:14.506 --> 01:28:17.814
[audience laughing, applauding]

01:28:17.857 --> 01:28:19.903
And thanks for the quid,
that'll come in proper useful

01:28:19.946 --> 01:28:21.252
for the leccy meter.

01:28:28.564 --> 01:28:31.044
Yeah, that's right,
that's right.

01:28:31.088 --> 01:28:32.698
My family is poor.

01:28:33.699 --> 01:28:35.614
We're so poor, the food bank

01:28:35.658 --> 01:28:38.356
took one look at us
and denied us credit.

01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:39.836
[audience laughing]

01:28:39.879 --> 01:28:41.664
[Sarah] Got to laugh,
haven't you?

01:28:41.707 --> 01:28:43.753
It's all right, you can.

01:28:43.796 --> 01:28:46.843
I mean, I don't consider
my life chaos.

01:28:46.886 --> 01:28:51.761
It's just... it's just
emotionally action-packed.

01:28:52.414 --> 01:28:53.415
Yeah.

01:28:55.634 --> 01:28:57.636
I mean, take my mom,
for example.

01:28:58.985 --> 01:29:02.554
Please take her.
Genuinely. Please take her.

01:29:02.598 --> 01:29:05.296
She is mad, she is.

01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:07.211
You would not believe
some of the stuff

01:29:07.254 --> 01:29:08.343
that she comes out with.

01:29:08.386 --> 01:29:12.216
She is crackers.
She is out of control!

01:29:13.130 --> 01:29:14.174
[chuckles]

01:29:16.525 --> 01:29:18.353
No, as in she's actually
mentally ill.

01:29:20.093 --> 01:29:23.662
Mm. Laughing one minute,
crying the next.

01:29:25.229 --> 01:29:27.362
Can't eat without getting food
all over her face.

01:29:27.405 --> 01:29:29.886
It's like...
it's like she's my third child.

01:29:32.584 --> 01:29:34.717
Which, at 15 years old,

01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:36.632
I guess is actually pretty
normal for Margate, isn't it?

01:29:36.675 --> 01:29:37.676
[chuckles]

01:29:38.721 --> 01:29:39.722
Anyway.

01:29:40.505 --> 01:29:41.941
So I've had to step up.

01:29:41.985 --> 01:29:43.856
You know, earn the extra cash.

01:29:45.728 --> 01:29:48.208
I had a job down at the arcades.

01:29:48.252 --> 01:29:49.819
On the seafront.

01:29:49.862 --> 01:29:54.301
And, you know, I... I earned
a little extra on the side.

01:29:54.345 --> 01:29:56.216
I mean, we've all done it,
haven't we?

01:29:56.260 --> 01:29:58.828
Don't lie, we've all done it.

01:29:58.871 --> 01:30:01.657
Can't afford
to feed your family,

01:30:01.700 --> 01:30:05.748
so you've gotta give hand jobs
to old men down the back alley.

01:30:07.793 --> 01:30:10.405
[Sarah] No? Just me then.

01:30:10.448 --> 01:30:13.408
But you know what?
It worked, so...

01:30:13.451 --> 01:30:15.714
Well, until my boss caught me
the other day,

01:30:15.758 --> 01:30:17.412
you know,
red-handed and all that.

01:30:18.369 --> 01:30:20.153
He hauled me into his office.

01:30:20.197 --> 01:30:23.330
He said I was
in very, very big trouble.

01:30:23.374 --> 01:30:25.332
And I thought
he was gonna fire me.

01:30:25.376 --> 01:30:27.073
Seriously. I was so scared.

01:30:29.641 --> 01:30:31.600
But he decided
to rape me instead.

01:30:32.557 --> 01:30:34.559
[audience murmuring]

01:30:40.739 --> 01:30:44.221
They say rape
can never be funny, but I...

01:30:48.878 --> 01:30:51.707
Now, I guess I can't stay
in Margate any longer, can I?

01:30:55.928 --> 01:30:57.408
I'll let myself out.

01:30:57.452 --> 01:30:58.627
[mic thuds]

01:31:01.325 --> 01:31:03.327
[rapid retreating footsteps]

01:31:04.633 --> 01:31:07.070
[audience murmuring]

01:31:09.551 --> 01:31:11.596
[man coughing]

01:31:24.087 --> 01:31:26.089
[somber music]

01:31:28.787 --> 01:31:30.485
[panting]

01:32:13.092 --> 01:32:15.094
[train approaching]

01:32:24.669 --> 01:32:27.672
[ominous music]

01:33:01.053 --> 01:33:03.403
[ominous music continues]

01:33:33.433 --> 01:33:35.435
[somber music]

01:33:56.761 --> 01:33:59.416
[somber music continues]

01:34:07.554 --> 01:34:08.860
[sniffles]

01:34:26.356 --> 01:34:29.185
[cell phone buzzing]

01:34:34.669 --> 01:34:38.237
[buzzing continues]

01:34:38.281 --> 01:34:39.630
[Adam] You gonna answer that?

01:35:05.612 --> 01:35:07.614
[calm music]

01:35:40.343 --> 01:35:43.128
