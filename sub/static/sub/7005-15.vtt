WEBVTT

00:02.168 --> 00:05.203
Welcome back to <i>tool time</i>
and our week-long salute...

00:05.204 --> 00:07.506
<i>(♪ bugle plays reveille)</i>

00:09.175 --> 00:10.642
...To the military.

00:10.643 --> 00:13.211
A subject near and dear
to my heart.
Tell them about it.

00:13.212 --> 00:15.280
Well, I was a navy c.B.

00:15.281 --> 00:17.582
That, of course, stands for
construction battalion.
That's right.

00:17.583 --> 00:21.219
We are always the first ones in
laying the groundwork
for the other forces.

00:21.220 --> 00:23.221
We're the ones
building the bridges.
Klaus!

00:23.222 --> 00:25.990
We're building the roads,
the landing strips...

00:25.991 --> 00:28.360
<i>(♪ theme music)</i>

00:28.361 --> 00:30.362
We're...

00:33.566 --> 00:37.502
Today we're talking about tools
the military uses. Ok?

00:37.503 --> 00:39.304
Now, I needed a little help
on today's show.

00:39.305 --> 00:42.074
An old high-school buddy
of mine, billy mcdougal,
will be here.

00:42.075 --> 00:45.077
We used to call him
"moon pie face."
but no longer.

00:45.078 --> 00:46.811
Now it's lieutenant colonel
william mcdougal

00:46.812 --> 00:48.580
Of the United States
marine corps.

00:48.581 --> 00:52.150
Let's bring him out here
with a big round of applause.
Come on out here, billy.

00:56.589 --> 01:00.792
Moon pie, moon pie, moon pie.

01:00.793 --> 01:02.694
It's amazing, you know?

01:02.695 --> 01:07.899
I guess they wanted
a few good men and one big wuss.

01:07.900 --> 01:10.135
Tim, if I remember correctly,
you were such a wimp,

01:10.136 --> 01:13.371
Even the cub scouts
wouldn't take you.

01:14.474 --> 01:16.874
Yeah. But the girl scouts
loved me.

01:19.245 --> 01:21.112
We used to play war
all the time as kids.

01:21.113 --> 01:22.980
What's it like playing war
and getting paid for it?

01:22.981 --> 01:26.684
Timmy, I'm not playing
war anymore.
I'm a tank battalion commander.

01:26.685 --> 01:30.721
And today I've brought along
a lot of the tools
we use to work on the tanks.

01:30.722 --> 01:32.157
Well, let's bring 'em on
out here.

01:32.158 --> 01:34.526
Heidi, the tools
for the tanks, please.

01:36.028 --> 01:37.895
Here you go, tim.

01:39.632 --> 01:41.700
Thank you, heidi.

01:41.701 --> 01:45.269
All right, let's start
with the tool that we call
"the dog bone."

01:45.270 --> 01:47.772
Let me see that.
Hold onto that, timmy.

01:49.441 --> 01:53.545
Now, we use that as a jack
to lift road wheels.

02:00.553 --> 02:04.489
Next, we've got a tool
that we call "the little joe."

02:04.490 --> 02:08.826
Little joe.
It looks more like hoss to me.

02:08.827 --> 02:12.296
It's definitely no hop sing,
I'll tell you that.

02:12.297 --> 02:14.032
Well, let's cut to the chase.

02:14.033 --> 02:16.234
Is there any way you could swing
it so I could drive a tank?

02:16.235 --> 02:18.837
Well, tim, if you ever came
out to california,
where I'm stationed,

02:18.838 --> 02:20.605
I'm sure we could arrange
something.

02:20.606 --> 02:23.408
All right!
Excuse me, colonel,
but letting tim drive a tank,

02:23.409 --> 02:27.746
Well... That's jeopardizing
national security.

02:27.747 --> 02:30.648
Let it go, al, please?
Al, you've got nothing
to worry about.

02:30.649 --> 02:33.618
We've got 10,000 marines
on the base to keep their eyes
on tim.

02:33.619 --> 02:37.321
All right!
It's not enough.

03:31.443 --> 03:34.012
Jill!
Yeah, out here!

03:35.881 --> 03:39.083
What a great show today.
We did our salute
to the military, right?

03:39.084 --> 03:43.187
I got invited out to
california to a military base
to drive a tank.

03:43.188 --> 03:47.324
Wow, that's so great!
When do we go?

03:47.325 --> 03:49.326
We?

03:50.729 --> 03:54.565
Is that "we" like in "we,"
or "we" like in "whee!"?

03:56.035 --> 03:58.336
You're not planning on
going without me?

03:58.337 --> 04:00.338
Well, I... No.

04:00.339 --> 04:02.673
I thought I'd make
reservations at that spa
in palm springs.

04:02.674 --> 04:05.176
Yes!
You'll be at that hotel
soaking in mud,

04:05.177 --> 04:08.045
And I'll be at the base
driving through it.

04:09.982 --> 04:12.517
Tim, I'm the army brat.

04:12.518 --> 04:16.087
It'd be fun for me to go
to a military base.

04:16.088 --> 04:19.024
Driving a tank is not
about fun.

04:19.024 --> 04:21.225
What is it about?

04:21.226 --> 04:23.561
It's about grown men
driving heavy equipment

04:23.562 --> 04:27.098
While other grown men
hide in bushes
and act like bad guys.

04:30.002 --> 04:32.369
I do not want to hang
around the hotel

04:32.370 --> 04:34.505
While you get to go off
and do all the cool stuff.

04:34.506 --> 04:36.140
Oh, cool stuff?
Yes.

04:36.141 --> 04:38.576
In the desert, it's hot.
You know how you are.

04:38.577 --> 04:40.811
<i>(mocking jill)</i> "it's so hot.

04:40.812 --> 04:43.448
My hair is so sandy
and my skin's so dry,

04:43.449 --> 04:47.085
It's like a pair of alligator
shoes. Look at this.
It's cracking."

04:47.086 --> 04:51.255
Tim, that is not me -
that's you.

04:51.256 --> 04:54.726
Now, why can't I go
to the base?
What's the purpose of it?

04:54.727 --> 04:56.961
You know the military
doesn't allow women
to drive tanks.

04:56.962 --> 04:59.263
You'd just be standing
around, bored.
I would not.

04:59.264 --> 05:01.265
I would be standing around
trying to convince them

05:01.266 --> 05:04.769
That women are perfectly
capable of driving tanks.

05:04.770 --> 05:06.871
Well, there's a good time.

05:08.574 --> 05:10.475
Oh, come on!
How many times do we find

05:10.476 --> 05:12.877
Something that we're both
interested in?

05:12.878 --> 05:17.182
Never. And I don't want to
screw up a winning formula.

05:17.183 --> 05:20.284
Come on! We'll have the boys
stay with al.

05:20.285 --> 05:22.921
What do you say?
What do you say?

05:22.922 --> 05:26.090
Four words that seem
to rule my life -

05:26.091 --> 05:28.760
"anything you want, jill."

05:37.670 --> 05:40.171
<i>(knocking)</i>

05:40.172 --> 05:43.808
Ah, just a minute... Ok.

05:43.809 --> 05:47.178
<i>(tim)</i> al, quit fluffing
the pillows and let us in.

05:49.614 --> 05:52.417
Hey, all right!
Come on in! How are ya?

05:52.418 --> 05:55.219
Hey, watch the hair!
Ok.

05:55.220 --> 05:57.555
Thank you so much
for taking care of
them this weekend.

05:57.556 --> 05:59.290
Oh, please. Yeah.
Yeah.

05:59.291 --> 06:03.395
It really works out for us
that you have no life.

06:03.396 --> 06:04.996
I have a life.

06:04.997 --> 06:08.099
It just happens that ilene is
away at an orthodontic retreat.

06:08.100 --> 06:11.168
Besides, I love hanging out
with these guys.

06:11.169 --> 06:13.237
Oh, I'm gonna miss you boys
so much.

06:13.238 --> 06:15.507
You guys have a good time, ok?
Listen to al, all right?

06:15.508 --> 06:18.676
That's right.
We'll have a wild, carefree
weekend! Anything goes!

06:18.677 --> 06:21.846
All right!
Oh, but not there. No.

06:23.916 --> 06:25.984
Ok. Al, here's the number
of the hotel.

06:25.985 --> 06:28.653
If you can't page us
in the room,
then page us at the pool.

06:28.654 --> 06:30.688
Ok.
If you can't page us at
the pool, page at the base.

06:30.689 --> 06:32.290
I wrote this number down
here, too.

06:32.291 --> 06:34.525
Now, don't forget there's
a three-hour time difference.

06:34.526 --> 06:36.161
If it's 4:00 here,
it's 1:00 there.

06:36.162 --> 06:38.296
Right.
If it's 6:00 here,
it's 3:00 there.

06:38.297 --> 06:40.331
Honey, if you keep talking
to him,

06:40.332 --> 06:42.600
We'll still be here
before we even get there.

06:42.601 --> 06:45.236
Here, here.
Ok. Thank you so much. Bye.

06:45.237 --> 06:47.338
Have a good time.
Bye, kids. Be good.

06:47.339 --> 06:49.340
Well, ok. Bye.

06:49.341 --> 06:54.112
Well, are you ready for
a carefree, wild weekend?

06:54.113 --> 06:56.814
Yeah. What are we gonna do?
Well, I thought we would...

06:56.815 --> 06:59.717
Don't touch that.
Your dad already broke it.

07:01.954 --> 07:06.858
You know, I thought maybe
we'd start off
with a rousing game of...

07:06.859 --> 07:09.627
Parcheesi. Huh?

07:09.628 --> 07:13.164
Winner gets a fat-free fig bar.

07:13.165 --> 07:16.801
What a treat for
three fig lovers like us!

07:16.802 --> 07:19.537
Oh, not to worry.
I got a consolation prize -

07:19.538 --> 07:22.339
Low-sodium rice cakes.

07:25.377 --> 07:28.378
This is great.
Mom and dad get to go
to california,

07:28.379 --> 07:31.449
And we get figs and rice.

07:31.450 --> 07:33.851
Ok, I see what it is.

07:33.852 --> 07:36.688
You guys are feeling
a little left out. Huh?

07:36.689 --> 07:39.790
Yeah, well, I know what
it feels like to be left out.

07:39.791 --> 07:42.460
When I was your age,
my folks left me

07:42.461 --> 07:46.163
When they went off
to the amish country.

07:49.601 --> 07:52.036
I remained bitter for years.

07:53.906 --> 07:56.040
Well, you got over it, right?

07:57.476 --> 07:59.777
Rather not talk about it.

08:04.483 --> 08:06.817
There are four fuel tanks
on the m1 a1

08:06.818 --> 08:10.855
That hold a total
of 504 gallons.

08:10.856 --> 08:13.591
Whoo! I hope you have
self-serve.

08:13.592 --> 08:16.627
What does this thing weigh?
I'm guessing 65 tons.

08:16.628 --> 08:19.063
No, no, no. It's gotta be
more like a hundred tons.

08:19.064 --> 08:22.066
Actually, the curb weight
is 67.7 tons.

08:22.067 --> 08:24.201
Very impressive, jill.

08:24.202 --> 08:27.271
She grew up
on a military base.
I always loved tanks.

08:27.272 --> 08:28.640
Hey, wait a minute!

08:28.641 --> 08:31.976
What does one of these things
cost... Out the door?

08:31.977 --> 08:35.013
4.3 million.
A little more
if you want the cd player.

08:35.014 --> 08:37.881
Wow! Well, what kind of
engine's in it?

08:37.883 --> 08:40.049
1500-horsepower gas turbine.

08:40.051 --> 08:42.754
Wow!
The old m48 had what? 750?

08:42.755 --> 08:45.089
This tank also has
battlefield override,

08:45.090 --> 08:49.127
A 120-millimeter smooth bore,
and enhanced shift tie-downs.

08:49.128 --> 08:50.628
You know, to make it
look better...

08:50.629 --> 08:52.730
Chrome wheels
and a custom paint job.

08:52.731 --> 08:54.399
I'll mention that
to the pentagon.

08:54.400 --> 08:57.568
Jill, you really know
your tanks.
Oh, I always loved tanks.

08:57.569 --> 09:00.070
When I was a child,
I used to dream of driving one.

09:00.071 --> 09:02.239
Of course, I knew that
I would never get to

09:02.240 --> 09:05.276
Since I'm just a lowly,
inept, helpless female.

09:05.277 --> 09:08.179
And it starts.

09:08.180 --> 09:11.415
You know, many people think
that policy is outdated.

09:11.416 --> 09:13.484
Good.

09:13.485 --> 09:16.621
Uh, tim, you might want
to stay away from
the tank commander's post.

09:16.622 --> 09:19.057
There are buttons there
that can get you into trouble.

09:19.058 --> 09:21.925
Oh, I love buttons.

09:21.926 --> 09:23.694
Oh, man, what I wouldn't give

09:23.695 --> 09:26.464
To get behind the t-bar
of one of these hogs.

09:26.465 --> 09:30.434
Well, jill, even though women
aren't allowed to operate these
in combat,

09:30.435 --> 09:32.936
We could arrange
a test drive for you.

09:32.937 --> 09:35.906
No! You're kidding me!
You're gonna let me drive
a tank?

09:35.907 --> 09:38.710
Tim, he is gonna let me
drive a tank!

09:38.711 --> 09:40.911
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

09:40.912 --> 09:43.348
She has the facts,
but hands-on experience -

09:43.349 --> 09:45.816
That's something else.

09:58.897 --> 10:00.598
Everybody ok?

10:00.599 --> 10:04.034
I was just showing her
how to use the machine gun.

10:11.609 --> 10:13.610
<i>(billy)</i> these are
the tanks you'll be driving.

10:13.611 --> 10:17.281
Now, remember, timmy,
this isn't the old chevy nova
you had in high school.

10:17.282 --> 10:18.715
<i>(tim)</i> of course not.
That bit the dust

10:18.716 --> 10:22.019
When the tree ran
into me, remember?

10:22.020 --> 10:24.855
We've set up
a little obstacle course
for the two of you.

10:24.856 --> 10:28.258
You got a real one for me
and, like, a little baby one
for jill?

10:28.259 --> 10:31.462
We'll see who's crying for
his mommy when this is over.

10:31.463 --> 10:33.197
Yeah, we will.
Yeah.

10:33.198 --> 10:35.766
Now, remember the objective
is to maneuver
through the course

10:35.767 --> 10:37.735
Without knocking over pylons.

10:37.736 --> 10:39.904
So, let's pile on!

10:39.905 --> 10:43.241
And remember, honey,
this isn't like driving
around the mall parking lot.

10:43.242 --> 10:45.443
Yeah. It's not like
that <i>tool time</i> set either.

10:45.444 --> 10:47.678
If you have any questions,
just ask your tank commander.

10:47.679 --> 10:50.147
You'll be communicating
with your radio mike.

10:50.148 --> 10:52.517
I got it.
Got it.

10:52.518 --> 10:54.852
And good luck out there.

10:54.853 --> 10:57.721
Fire in the hole.

10:59.958 --> 11:02.927
Eat my dust, sucker.

11:13.038 --> 11:15.640
<i>(jill laughs)</i>

11:15.641 --> 11:19.410
<i>(jill)</i> whoa, I love this!
<i>(man)</i> easy on the throttle,
mr. Taylor.

11:19.411 --> 11:23.247
Will you relax?
I know what I'm doing here.

11:25.183 --> 11:28.219
Wait a minute.
Ok, yeah, all right!

11:28.220 --> 11:31.522
<i>(man)</i> watch out, mrs. Taylor.
Looks like our husband
is losing control.

11:31.523 --> 11:33.791
Tim? What is he doing?

11:33.792 --> 11:36.661
<i>(man)</i> mr. Taylor,
watch out for the pylons.

11:36.662 --> 11:39.430
<i>(tim)</i> oh, hey! Wait a minute.
Yeah, ok, ok.

11:41.667 --> 11:44.936
<i>(man)</i> look out, mrs. Taylor.
He's cutting you off.

11:44.937 --> 11:47.171
It's a traffic lane here,
jill!

11:50.509 --> 11:52.343
<i>(man)</i> mr. Taylor,
look out for that sign.

11:52.344 --> 11:55.412
What sign?

11:55.413 --> 11:57.381
Oh, that sign.

11:57.382 --> 12:00.151
<i>(man)</i> mrs. Taylor,
is your husband
out of his mind?

12:00.152 --> 12:02.919
<i>(jill)</i> yes, sir, corporal, sir.

12:10.195 --> 12:13.297
Oh, incoming! Incoming!

12:21.039 --> 12:24.141
Ok. Just playing through!

12:32.250 --> 12:35.552
Bill, what are the chances of
me driving that tank again?

12:35.553 --> 12:39.456
Oh, about the same as
<i>tool time</i> winning an emmy.

12:42.360 --> 12:45.296
You know,
that little tank accident
could've happened to anyone.

12:45.297 --> 12:49.099
Tim, it's never happened in
the history of the marines.

12:49.100 --> 12:52.236
Well, the important thing is
is that nobody got hurt.

12:52.237 --> 12:54.872
And we know our country
would win

12:54.873 --> 12:59.643
If we're ever invaded
by enemy golf carts.

12:59.644 --> 13:02.012
Tim, not only is she
a better tank driver than you,

13:02.013 --> 13:04.147
She's also funnier.

13:04.148 --> 13:08.085
Yeah. I just can't stop
laughing, bill.
No.

13:08.086 --> 13:10.988
Mmm, chipped beef on toast.

13:10.989 --> 13:13.357
I haven't had this
since I was 11 years old.

13:15.027 --> 13:18.729
Ew! You're probably still
digesting it.

13:18.730 --> 13:20.597
Colonel, I can't
thank you enough.

13:20.598 --> 13:23.167
You fulfilled a childhood dream
for me today.

13:23.168 --> 13:25.002
It was a pleasure
watching you in action.

13:25.003 --> 13:27.238
Looked like you've been
driving a tank all your life.

13:27.239 --> 13:30.474
Oh, it was such a cool feeling.
You know, when I started,
I was so scared.

13:30.475 --> 13:33.010
And then I got comfortable,
and it was so much fun.

13:33.011 --> 13:35.512
When you grabbed that t-bar,
you just let her rip...

13:35.513 --> 13:37.815
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

13:37.816 --> 13:42.419
You know, how do they get
the tea this color? Boy.

13:42.420 --> 13:45.622
Hey, steve, have a seat!
I'd like you to meet
my old buddy, tim taylor.

13:45.623 --> 13:48.492
Good to meet you, sir.
And his lovely wife, jill.

13:48.493 --> 13:52.062
Hi, it's nice to meet you.
You must be that woman
the whole base is talking about.

13:52.063 --> 13:55.899
Boy, that was some
tank driving!
Well, thank you very much.

13:55.900 --> 13:58.235
You know, my husband got
to drive a tank, too.

13:58.236 --> 14:02.739
Yeah. The whole base is
talking about that, too.

14:02.740 --> 14:06.577
Yeah, you sure beat the pants
off old timmy here.

14:06.578 --> 14:08.813
Well, it wasn't a race.
Yeah, you're right.

14:08.814 --> 14:11.281
Now, come on, give him a break.
He's probably just one of
those guys

14:11.282 --> 14:14.985
That doesn't know
a whole lot about machines.

14:14.986 --> 14:17.521
What do you do
for a living, sir?

14:17.522 --> 14:19.389
I own a little dress shop.

14:21.827 --> 14:24.595
No, he doesn't.
He's got his own tool show.

14:24.596 --> 14:26.931
No. And it's a great show.

14:26.932 --> 14:29.166
I mean, he may have had
a little trouble
with those obstacles,

14:29.167 --> 14:32.937
But it wasn't an easy course.
Jill, you don't have
to defend me, ok?

14:32.938 --> 14:34.205
Not defending.
I'm just stating the facts.

14:34.206 --> 14:36.373
You didn't have trouble
with the course.

14:36.374 --> 14:39.142
Well, ok.
I did a little better than you.

14:39.143 --> 14:41.178
So, big deal. Who cares?

14:41.179 --> 14:46.250
I care, little
"miss the whole base
is talking about you."

14:46.251 --> 14:49.186
I can't believe
you're being such a baby.
Oh, me? I'm the baby?

14:49.187 --> 14:51.756
So, whose turn is it
to lower the flag
this week?

14:51.757 --> 14:54.091
I don't know. Maybe we both
ought to do it, huh?

14:54.092 --> 14:55.859
You don't have to go, guys.
Come on.

14:55.860 --> 14:58.495
Sorry, tim.
It's not our war.

15:02.934 --> 15:06.504
Congratulations.
You just did something
most countries can't do -

15:06.505 --> 15:09.540
You got the marines
to retreat.

15:09.541 --> 15:12.109
They didn't leave because of me.
They left because you got angry.

15:12.110 --> 15:15.913
Well, excuse me!
Not only did you beat me
on the obstacle course,

15:15.914 --> 15:17.915
You defend me
like I'm a five-year-old.

15:17.916 --> 15:20.083
Well, you're acting
like a five-year-old.

15:20.084 --> 15:22.753
You're upset
because I drove the tank well.

15:22.754 --> 15:26.557
No. I'm upset
because you driving it well
made me look like an idiot!

15:28.659 --> 15:32.662
Well, even if I hadn't been
there, you still would've
driven like an idiot.

15:38.903 --> 15:43.107
Well, that was a pretty quick
game of scrabble.

15:43.108 --> 15:44.942
Now we're ready
for chinese checkers.

15:44.943 --> 15:46.877
Oh, sorry, al.
Mom says we're not allowed

15:46.878 --> 15:50.681
To be playing chinese checkers
before bed. Makes us too hyper.

15:53.051 --> 15:56.320
All right.
Well, if conventional games
don't tickle your fancy,

15:56.321 --> 15:59.423
I have a board game
that you have never seen.

16:00.459 --> 16:03.193
I invented this myself.

16:03.194 --> 16:07.798
It is the prototype
for what could become
a national craze.

16:10.001 --> 16:13.537
<i>(mark)</i> "the tool time game"?
Awesome!

16:13.538 --> 16:15.706
<i>(♪ theme music)</i>

16:18.877 --> 16:20.611
How do you play?

16:20.612 --> 16:24.381
Well, you have your choice
of figures.

16:24.382 --> 16:27.518
You can be heidi.

16:27.519 --> 16:30.053
You can be al.

16:30.054 --> 16:33.190
And you can be tim
in a body cast.

16:35.092 --> 16:37.661
All right, I got heidi.
Al.

16:37.662 --> 16:41.298
Aw, man!

16:41.299 --> 16:44.368
Now, the object of the game
is to finish your project

16:44.369 --> 16:47.838
Without having
to call an ambulance.

16:47.839 --> 16:50.941
All right? Now, you can learn
as you go along. Mark, why don't
you start us off?

16:50.942 --> 16:54.110
Ok. Start.

16:54.111 --> 16:56.680
Two.

16:56.681 --> 16:59.050
"tim makes bad joke
about al's mom.

16:59.051 --> 17:02.319
Audience boos. Lose a turn."

17:05.490 --> 17:07.790
Mother loves that card.

17:09.294 --> 17:12.061
All right, it's my turn.
That's right.

17:14.031 --> 17:16.066
Ooh, four.

17:18.804 --> 17:21.338
"al's away at
national bingo finals.

17:21.339 --> 17:24.275
Tim hosts show alone
and ratings drop."

17:26.111 --> 17:28.444
All right. My turn.

17:28.445 --> 17:32.650
All right, here we go.
Six, ok...

17:32.651 --> 17:36.654
Five, six. All right.
Pick up a card.

17:36.655 --> 17:39.422
"tim installs faulty wiring.

17:39.423 --> 17:43.259
You're accidentally
electrocuted."

17:48.500 --> 17:50.534
<i>(siren)</i>

17:56.208 --> 17:58.842
You lose.

18:01.312 --> 18:04.014
Hey, wilson.
Well, hi-ho, neighbor.

18:04.015 --> 18:07.651
When did you get back
from california?
Just a few minutes ago.

18:07.652 --> 18:09.653
Mm, smells like ribs.

18:09.654 --> 18:13.690
Well, actually,
I'm barbecuing some bulbs.

18:17.294 --> 18:20.431
Fluorescent or three-way?

18:20.432 --> 18:22.332
No, tim. These are lily bulbs.

18:22.333 --> 18:26.703
These are a dietary staple of
the native americans of montana.

18:26.704 --> 18:28.772
So, how was your tank-driving
expedition?

18:28.773 --> 18:32.109
A real kick in the lily bulbs.

18:32.110 --> 18:34.544
What do you mean?

18:34.545 --> 18:38.248
Well, jill and I both got
to drive tanks.
Right?

18:38.249 --> 18:41.651
And she has to act
like a big shot by
not driving through a sign,

18:41.652 --> 18:46.490
Or shooting off a machine
gun, or crushing a couple
of golf carts.

18:46.491 --> 18:49.827
Mm-mm-mm, she is such
a show-off.

18:49.828 --> 18:52.296
I didn't even want her
going with me.

18:52.297 --> 18:55.132
Well, traditionally,
driving tanks
is a man's domain.

18:55.133 --> 18:58.502
<i>(grunting)</i> yeah, man's domain.
Oh, yeah.

18:58.503 --> 19:00.304
And to the best
of my knowledge,

19:00.305 --> 19:02.506
Women in the service aren't
even allowed to drive tanks.

19:02.507 --> 19:06.210
Yeah, no women drivers.
Oh, no.

19:06.211 --> 19:08.045
Which makes it
all the more incredible

19:08.046 --> 19:10.113
That jill was able
to accomplish what she did.

19:10.114 --> 19:14.251
Yeah, that's all the more...
Huh?

19:14.252 --> 19:18.289
Well, you did compliment her
on her tank-driving expertise?

19:18.290 --> 19:20.224
How can you take her side?

19:20.225 --> 19:22.493
By her tagging along,
she ruined my day.

19:22.494 --> 19:24.461
Well, maybe you ruined her day

19:24.462 --> 19:27.163
By not acknowledging
her accomplishment.

19:27.164 --> 19:31.035
Well, maybe you ruined my day
by pointing that out.

19:33.671 --> 19:37.207
Thanks, al!
<i>(boys)</i> thank you, al!
'night. Bye.

19:37.208 --> 19:39.776
So how was it?
How was the weekend?
Oh, the best.

19:39.777 --> 19:42.111
Al let us stay up
and watch monster movies.

19:42.112 --> 19:44.548
And he made us popcorn
just dripping with butter.

19:44.549 --> 19:47.083
Oh, ho, ho, ho...

19:47.084 --> 19:50.253
Yeah. He even separated
the unpopped kernels for us.

19:50.254 --> 19:54.624
Well, I guess I'm never gonna
be half the mother al is.

19:56.228 --> 19:57.962
Hey, boys.

19:57.963 --> 20:00.096
Hey, dad?
How come you didn't marry al?

20:00.097 --> 20:02.199
Yeah.

20:02.200 --> 20:06.003
Well, to be honest with you,
I thought about it.

20:06.004 --> 20:09.706
But I just couldn't handle
the thought of him
giving birth to my children.

20:09.707 --> 20:13.344
Little babies with beards
and flannel diapers. Ick!

20:13.345 --> 20:16.046
So, when you were driving
the tank, how did it go?

20:16.047 --> 20:19.483
Ooh, the tank stuff!
Wait till I tell you...

20:19.484 --> 20:21.952
We should talk about
your mom's experience first.

20:21.953 --> 20:25.155
Great. We talked about it
at the base. We talked
about it on the plane.

20:25.156 --> 20:27.357
They let her drive one, too.

20:27.358 --> 20:30.928
And she was awesome.
<i>(randy)</i> you're kidding.

20:30.929 --> 20:32.162
No.
That's awesome!

20:32.163 --> 20:33.831
It is great.
She drove it like a pro.

20:33.832 --> 20:37.001
First woman to drive a tank.
You should be real proud of her.
It was great.

20:37.002 --> 20:41.872
As a matter of fact, the first
four million I'm getting,
I'm buying a tank for her.

20:41.873 --> 20:45.576
Never worry about finding
a parking place in her life.

20:45.577 --> 20:48.445
Cool.
All right. So, did you guys
shoot the little...

20:48.446 --> 20:50.447
<i>(overlapping)</i>

20:50.448 --> 20:52.482
Wait, wait, wait!
You guys put your stuff away.

20:52.483 --> 20:54.184
We'll talk about this
at dinner, all right?

20:54.185 --> 20:56.420
Hustle up. Hustle up.
No.

20:59.791 --> 21:01.825
That was really nice.
Thank you.

21:01.826 --> 21:05.062
Well, it would've been
a lot nicer
if I had said it earlier.

21:05.063 --> 21:07.864
I got thrown for a loop
at the base when I found out

21:07.865 --> 21:11.801
I was married to
general george patton...

21:11.802 --> 21:15.105
And I was
<i>(imitating gomer pyle)</i>
gomer pyle.

21:15.106 --> 21:18.908
Shazam! Shazam! Shazam!

21:18.909 --> 21:22.011
Well, golly, sergeant carter!

21:25.516 --> 21:27.317
...Across the desert was great.

21:27.318 --> 21:29.719
So, dad, how did you do
at the marine base?

21:29.720 --> 21:33.023
Yeah, dad. You told us
about mom, but you never
told us about how you did.

21:33.024 --> 21:34.724
Well, let's put it this way -

21:34.725 --> 21:39.063
The marines said no one's ever
driven a tank like your old man.

21:40.665 --> 21:44.034
You were that good, huh?
I don't want to brag.

21:44.035 --> 21:46.703
You know, but I was
in my element, guys.

21:46.704 --> 21:51.608
Machines, marines, latrines
and lots and lots of beans.

21:51.609 --> 21:53.777
1500 horsepower
sitting behind me.

21:53.778 --> 21:58.115
I'm the master of that thing.
Oh! Ho-ho-ho-ho!

21:58.116 --> 22:00.551
My only regret?
You guys weren't there
to see it.

22:00.552 --> 22:02.886
Well, actually, dad,
you know, we can see it.

22:02.887 --> 22:05.388
The marines made a tape for mom.

22:08.025 --> 22:10.160
You can't look at that.
That's top-secret stuff.

22:10.161 --> 22:11.862
Oh, yeah? Really?

22:11.863 --> 22:13.931
Give it back.
