WEBVTT

00:08.274 --> 00:10.208
Bob.

00:10.276 --> 00:12.267
That's my soda.

00:13.546 --> 00:15.537
But I drank all mine.

00:18.051 --> 00:20.042
Keep it.

00:21.054 --> 00:23.420
Hey, that's <i>my</i> soda.

00:23.490 --> 00:25.822
Life is unfair.

00:27.060 --> 00:28.994
Oh, swell.

00:29.062 --> 00:31.223
It's Max from the radio station.

00:31.297 --> 00:33.356
His ad rates bled me dry.

00:33.433 --> 00:35.458
I got nothin' to say to him.

00:35.535 --> 00:37.730
Hiya, Max!

00:37.804 --> 00:40.466
Oh, Bargain Bob!

00:40.540 --> 00:43.475
Hey, I'm sorry
you lost the store, man.

00:43.543 --> 00:46.011
Sorry? I lost it by choice.

00:47.013 --> 00:48.947
Yep, I'm doing great.

00:49.015 --> 00:51.813
Got the large fries, you know.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.615
Large fries. That's great.

00:55.688 --> 00:57.622
I'll see you.

00:57.690 --> 01:01.854
Hey, uh, speaking of fries, you got
any jobs down at the radio station?

01:01.928 --> 01:03.862
Oh, not for a guy like you.

01:03.930 --> 01:06.330
I'm currently looking
for an office girl...

01:06.399 --> 01:09.334
but usually my office girls
are... <i>girls.</i>

01:10.403 --> 01:12.337
Hi. I'm Donna. The girl.

01:12.405 --> 01:14.066
Okay, Donna!

01:14.140 --> 01:17.769
Listen, drop by the station
and we'll see what we can do.

01:17.844 --> 01:20.278
Sure. Thanks!

01:22.615 --> 01:25.607
I could have been an office girl.

01:27.320 --> 01:30.778
Aw, that does it.
This tastes like crap!

01:33.893 --> 01:35.827
May I help you, sir?

01:35.895 --> 01:37.829
Yeah.

01:37.897 --> 01:43.028
I wanna compliment you
on one tasty, fried piece of shoe.

01:44.437 --> 01:46.997
Let me take care of this
right now. Earl!

01:47.073 --> 01:49.064
Oh, no.

01:50.376 --> 01:52.537
- Did you say Earl?
- Just one second.

01:52.612 --> 01:54.273
Ricky, I'm glad you called me.

01:54.347 --> 01:57.248
I need to leave early for a...

01:57.317 --> 01:59.649
Oh. Hi, Red.

01:59.719 --> 02:01.482
You two know each other?

02:01.554 --> 02:04.045
I used to work for Red.
Then he fired me.

02:04.124 --> 02:07.059
Oh. Then he and I
have something in common.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.719
You're fired!

02:08.794 --> 02:11.593
What did I do?

02:11.664 --> 02:14.758
Hey, Bob.
Job just opened up for you.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.074

02:38.091 --> 02:40.025
Fez?

02:40.093 --> 02:42.027
What instrument's that?

02:42.095 --> 02:44.859
Instrument?

02:47.767 --> 02:51.897
Eric, I got a job! I'm sorting records
at Jerry Thunder's radio show!

02:51.971 --> 02:54.235
No way!

02:54.307 --> 02:57.504
WFPP? That's Jerry Thunder!

02:57.577 --> 02:59.511
The Sound!

02:59.579 --> 03:02.446
And he knows rock stars.
And he gets free concert tickets.

03:02.515 --> 03:05.450
And he gave me this guitar pick
from Foghat.

03:05.518 --> 03:07.315
No way!

03:09.322 --> 03:12.052
Eric, there's a whole pile
of bumper stickers, and they're free!

03:12.125 --> 03:15.060
No way!

03:15.128 --> 03:18.757
Okay, well, I gotta go. I gotta go
alphabetize the eight-tracks.

03:18.831 --> 03:20.560
No way!

03:59.906 --> 04:02.739
Leo, man, this place is a mess.

04:02.809 --> 04:05.505
Yeah?
You should see my garage.

04:08.348 --> 04:10.009
This is your garage, man.

04:10.083 --> 04:14.281
Well, then you see what I mean.
It's a mess.

04:14.354 --> 04:17.880
<i>National Geographic</i>
is a beautiful magazine.

04:19.858 --> 04:23.056
There is volcanoes and a gazelle.

04:23.129 --> 04:25.120
And naked...

04:26.332 --> 04:28.266
Leo, man, there's a car in here.

04:28.334 --> 04:31.098
- <i>It's an El Camino!</i>
- Ohh!

04:31.170 --> 04:33.570
Wow. Do you think it's mine?

04:33.640 --> 04:36.108
The plate says "Leo's."

04:36.175 --> 04:38.336
No, I mean the car, man.

04:40.179 --> 04:42.170
This guy, huh?

04:44.417 --> 04:47.352
And this is where we do the interviews.

04:47.420 --> 04:50.878
A lot of rock legends
have puked in this room.

04:50.957 --> 04:52.891
Good times.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.893
Wow.

04:54.961 --> 04:57.896
So, if I stay here long enough,
I might see a rock star throw up?

04:57.964 --> 05:01.161
See it?
You'll probably clean it up.

05:01.234 --> 05:04.397
All right!

05:04.470 --> 05:07.633
Oh, yeah, this is Jerry Thunder...

05:07.707 --> 05:10.904
Coming to you on The Sound!

05:10.977 --> 05:15.914
And it looks like we got a new office girl.
What's your name, baby?

05:15.982 --> 05:18.246
Um, Donna.

05:18.318 --> 05:23.415
Mmm. Well, Donna, you are hot.

05:23.489 --> 05:25.616
So I'm gonna call you...

05:25.692 --> 05:27.751
Hot Donna.

05:30.229 --> 05:32.663
Okay.

05:32.732 --> 05:36.361
<i>You got yourself a boyfriend,</i>
<i>Hot Donna?</i>

05:37.704 --> 05:41.231
Um... no.

05:41.307 --> 05:44.003
<i>Mmm!</i>
<i>That is good news, fellas.</i>

05:44.077 --> 05:45.942
'Cause Hot Donna is...

05:46.012 --> 05:48.003
<i>hot!</i>

05:51.284 --> 05:54.219
Max, why'd you make me say that?
'Cause I have a boyfriend.

05:54.287 --> 05:56.221
Fine. You have a boyfriend.

05:56.289 --> 05:58.382
So does Elton John.

06:02.295 --> 06:04.286
No way!

06:05.365 --> 06:07.299
Yeah! They're a fantastic couple.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.130
I love 'em.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.136
The point is...

06:11.204 --> 06:13.138
we're selling an image here...

06:13.206 --> 06:16.039
and an available Hot Donna
is good for ratings.

06:16.109 --> 06:19.977
Oh. Well, what the hell.
Eric won't have a problem with this.

06:20.046 --> 06:22.537
What the hell?
I have a problem with this!

06:22.615 --> 06:25.584
Maybe she dumped you
and forgot to tell you.

06:27.587 --> 06:30.078
Oh, my God.
Thank you, Nairobi.

06:33.159 --> 06:36.788
Look, Forman,
I wouldn't read too much into this.

06:36.863 --> 06:40.765
Donna probably just said she doesn't have
a boyfriend 'cause she's ashamed of you.

06:42.435 --> 06:44.903
Okay, baby, I'll see you later.

06:48.408 --> 06:51.036
Listen, Forman, you're just upset...

06:51.110 --> 06:54.045
because you know Donna is entering
the really cool world of FM radio.

06:54.113 --> 06:56.047
But, you know, feel good, man.

06:56.115 --> 06:59.949
'Cause you'll be like that first sweet
relationship she'll look back on fondly...

07:00.019 --> 07:02.954
while she's on the tour bus
straddling rock stars.

07:07.794 --> 07:11.093
Yeah, life just hasn't been the same
since I lost the van.

07:11.164 --> 07:14.099
It's hard to get chicks
when you don't have wheels.

07:14.167 --> 07:17.603
I mean, sometimes
a killer bod just isn't enough.

07:18.838 --> 07:21.068
Amen to that, brother.

07:24.377 --> 07:28.541
Okay, I'll sell the El Camino to you
for 500 bucks.

07:28.614 --> 07:30.343
- 400.
- 600.

07:30.416 --> 07:33.180
700! No! Damn! Wait!

07:33.252 --> 07:35.220
That's the wrong way. Um...

07:35.288 --> 07:37.256
Uh... 500.

07:37.323 --> 07:39.416
No.

07:39.492 --> 07:41.858
500.

07:43.062 --> 07:45.428
Sold.

07:45.498 --> 07:47.659
Sucker.

07:51.671 --> 07:54.231
Eric, don't worry about
this whole Donna thing.

07:54.307 --> 07:57.572
I know a lot of girls who are
much more realistic for you.

07:57.643 --> 08:00.578
They might be a little heavy,
or a little dumb, or have a cockeye, but...

08:00.646 --> 08:05.049
Jackie... she didn't break up
with me, okay?

08:05.117 --> 08:08.348
- She still loves me.
- Oh.

08:08.421 --> 08:10.787
So you're in the denial stage.

08:10.857 --> 08:13.189
- No.
- See?

08:15.361 --> 08:18.853
Oh, my God, you guys!
This has been the best day <i>ever.</i>

08:20.299 --> 08:23.234
Jerry Thunder has totally
taken me under his wing.

08:23.302 --> 08:26.032
And his stories... he's so funny!

08:26.105 --> 08:28.665
Oh! Elton John has a boyfriend!

08:30.977 --> 08:34.140
Plus, I get to meet Alice Cooper.
Here it is.

08:34.212 --> 08:36.306
I'm gonna see if Alice'll sign this.

08:36.381 --> 08:39.818
Oh, I can't make it
to the movie tonight. See ya.

08:43.489 --> 08:45.480
See?

08:46.526 --> 08:48.585
She still loves me.

08:48.661 --> 08:50.629
Yeah.

08:50.696 --> 08:52.687
Have you met my friend Fat Sally?

09:02.208 --> 09:04.073
Earl. What brings you here?

09:04.143 --> 09:05.974
Uh, I took the bus.

09:08.114 --> 09:11.914
First off, Kitty, I'd like to say
you have a lovely home.

09:11.984 --> 09:14.282
Second of all, screw you, Red.

09:14.353 --> 09:16.048
What?

09:16.122 --> 09:19.057
I'm out of work,
and it's all your fault.

09:19.125 --> 09:22.253
How am I supposed to
pay my bills or feed my dog...

09:22.328 --> 09:24.319
or... go to Hawaii?

09:25.831 --> 09:27.765
Look, Earl...

09:27.833 --> 09:30.267
you can't blame me for getting fired.

09:30.336 --> 09:33.271
I didn't make you too dumb
to flip burgers.

09:33.339 --> 09:36.001
That's God's fault.

09:36.075 --> 09:40.512
Yeah, well, you know the Christmas card
you get of me and my dog every year?

09:40.580 --> 09:43.014
You're off the list.
Yeah. That's right.

09:43.082 --> 09:46.415
Don't bother checking the mailbox, Red,
'cause it ain't comin'.

09:51.490 --> 09:54.550
I loved his Christmas cards.

09:54.627 --> 09:56.618
They were handmade.

09:59.098 --> 10:02.465
This is Jerry Thunder...

10:02.535 --> 10:04.662
comin' at you on The Sound!

10:04.737 --> 10:07.365
We got Alice Cooper
droppin' by any minute...

10:07.440 --> 10:10.170
and it is going to be wild!

10:10.242 --> 10:12.176
This is Jerry Thunder...

10:12.244 --> 10:16.943
Comin' your way on The Sound...

10:17.016 --> 10:21.214
<i>where we are enjoying lots of sex,</i>
<i>drugs and rock and roll.</i>

10:21.287 --> 10:24.017
<i>Am I right, Hot Donna?</i>

10:25.124 --> 10:27.058
You sure are, Jerry Thunder.

10:27.126 --> 10:29.526
Radio people are the coolest!

10:29.595 --> 10:33.964
That's right. That's why
you want to have sex with us all.

10:34.033 --> 10:36.524
I really do!

10:36.602 --> 10:40.231
<i>Hey, everybody, it's Alice Cooper!</i>

10:41.374 --> 10:43.308
Hey, Hot Donna.

10:43.376 --> 10:46.777
Heard about you
at the last big rock star meeting.

10:46.846 --> 10:48.780
Hey, Ted Nugent and I
were wondering...

10:48.848 --> 10:51.840
Did you ever break up
with that loser boyfriend of yours?

10:51.917 --> 10:55.148
Not yet, Alice Cooper.

10:55.221 --> 10:57.655
Here's my loser boyfriend right now.

10:57.723 --> 11:01.352
Hey, Donna. Are you ready
to go to the Price Mart ball?

11:02.728 --> 11:05.162
You hear that, everybody?
The Price Mart ball.

11:07.233 --> 11:10.828
Hey, I got an idea. Why don't we feed
your skinny boyfriend to the snake?

11:12.371 --> 11:14.862
Okay.

11:27.853 --> 11:29.844
Damn you, Alice Cooper.

11:34.994 --> 11:36.928
I haven't seen Donna in two days.

11:36.996 --> 11:39.931
She's been spending all of her time
at the radio station.

11:39.999 --> 11:41.933
This is a real problem.

11:42.001 --> 11:45.300
Oh, here we go again.
Forman's got a problem.

11:45.371 --> 11:49.467
Well, you know what? Maybe I got
a problem, man. Did you ever think of that?

11:50.476 --> 11:52.876
Oh. Man, Hyde, I'm sorry.

11:52.945 --> 11:54.936
Go ahead, man, Unload.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.483
Actually, I'm cool.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.485
And that's how you do it.

12:00.553 --> 12:03.420
You have a problem,
and you hold it in, man.

12:03.489 --> 12:05.480
Now, leather up, fruitcake.

12:07.326 --> 12:09.317
I have a problem.

12:10.730 --> 12:13.221
But I guess I'll keep it all inside.

12:16.769 --> 12:18.703
Hey, you guys...

12:18.771 --> 12:22.537
so, Leo agreed to sell me
the El Camino for, like, 500 bucks.

12:22.608 --> 12:25.304
So, what I need from you is...

12:25.377 --> 12:27.811
500 bucks.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.814
Hey, I'm Hyde.

12:29.882 --> 12:31.816
I don't feel anything.

12:31.884 --> 12:33.875
I'm just a frizzy-haired robot.

12:34.887 --> 12:36.821
Hey! I'm Forman!

12:36.889 --> 12:39.881
I use the same voice
to imitate everybody!

12:42.528 --> 12:44.519
It's just that I...

12:45.898 --> 12:47.889
I...

12:49.001 --> 12:50.992
Nothing.

12:52.238 --> 12:55.435
Oh!

12:55.508 --> 12:58.966
Gilligan screwed it up.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.271
He always screws it up.

13:05.284 --> 13:07.479
Why don't they just kill him?

13:11.657 --> 13:14.717
I don't think you're really
mad at Gilligan, Red.

13:14.794 --> 13:19.128
<i>Admit it. You feel guilty</i>
<i>about what happened to Earl.</i>

13:19.198 --> 13:22.998
This has nothing to do with Earl.

13:23.068 --> 13:27.334
The professor worked on that
coconut radio for three months.

13:29.341 --> 13:32.333
Now how the hell are they
gonna get off that island?

13:33.345 --> 13:35.279
Oh.

13:35.347 --> 13:38.441
Well, then I guess I was wrong.
I don't know why I questioned you.

13:38.517 --> 13:41.452
And I'll tell ya...

13:41.520 --> 13:44.182
something's going on
with that Skipper.

13:46.358 --> 13:49.088
You don't get that fat
eating coconuts.

13:56.836 --> 14:00.533
Jackie, you know I wouldn't ask you
if this wasn't important. Okay?

14:00.606 --> 14:03.404
But this is an El Camino.

14:04.643 --> 14:07.373
That's Spanish for "The Camino."

14:14.220 --> 14:17.849
By accepting this check,
you are agreeing to two things.

14:17.923 --> 14:21.086
First, you will pay me back in full...

14:21.160 --> 14:24.095
and you will be my slave
for a week.

14:24.163 --> 14:27.428
Meaning, like, your love slave?

14:28.434 --> 14:30.368
No.

14:30.436 --> 14:32.802
More like an errand boy.

14:32.872 --> 14:36.433
You mean,
like your errand love boy?

14:37.710 --> 14:40.543
No. Just errands.

14:41.614 --> 14:43.548
- Okay.
- Good. Here.

14:43.616 --> 14:46.551
Now, go get your car,
and then come by my place.

14:46.619 --> 14:49.816
I need you to hold my toes apart
while I paint them.

14:55.394 --> 14:57.726
Well, errand boy...

14:57.796 --> 15:00.390
you just sold your soul for a car.

15:00.466 --> 15:02.331
Who cares, Fez?

15:02.401 --> 15:05.700
Your soul is like an appendix.
I don't even use it.

15:17.449 --> 15:21.249
Kitty, about this burger...

15:21.319 --> 15:24.652
What? Is it burnt?
Are you gonna fire me?

15:24.723 --> 15:27.715
Make me live on the street
with the other hoboes?

15:29.327 --> 15:31.488
Kitty, let it go.

15:31.563 --> 15:34.396
I do not feel guilty!

15:37.969 --> 15:40.233
All right! I feel guilty!

15:44.342 --> 15:47.778
He'll thank me when his tummy
stops hurting.

15:47.846 --> 15:50.280
So...

15:50.348 --> 15:52.475
how are things with you and...

15:52.550 --> 15:54.541
Hot Donna?

16:01.359 --> 16:03.793
Well, if you heard about Hot Donna...

16:03.862 --> 16:06.296
then you heard
that I'm not her boyfriend.

16:06.364 --> 16:08.298
The whole world heard that.

16:08.366 --> 16:12.325
Well, people in Canada heard it.

16:12.404 --> 16:14.770
Oh, honey,
Canadians don't matter.

16:19.644 --> 16:22.943
What matters is that
you and Donna are okay. Right?

16:23.014 --> 16:25.448
Mom, I don't even know
if we're okay.

16:25.517 --> 16:28.213
She's spending all of her time
at The Sound with Jerry Thunder.

16:28.286 --> 16:31.722
That reminds me of when
I first started at the hospital.

16:31.790 --> 16:36.022
Your father was concerned that I was
spending way too much time down there...

16:36.094 --> 16:38.119
with all these handsome doctors.

16:38.196 --> 16:40.130
But, Mom, that's stupid.

16:40.198 --> 16:42.723
Doctors aren't important
like deejays.

16:44.969 --> 16:47.904
Okay, well, the point is...

16:47.972 --> 16:52.068
your dad started showing up
at the hospital to mark his territory...

16:52.143 --> 16:56.443
and one of the doctors, who was getting
a little fresh, got punched in the mouth.

17:00.151 --> 17:02.085
Dad's so cool.

17:03.521 --> 17:06.422
No, that wasn't cool.
It was embarrassing.

17:06.491 --> 17:08.152
But you married him.

17:08.226 --> 17:10.523
Yes, but it was embarrassing.

17:10.595 --> 17:12.460
Still, you married him.

17:12.530 --> 17:14.794
The point is,
you have to trust Donna.

17:14.866 --> 17:17.561
But Dad didn't trust you,
and you married him.

17:17.635 --> 17:20.398
Okay, you know what?
I can't talk to you.

17:27.846 --> 17:32.545
Okay, I am here to withdraw
my complaint about my overcooked burger.

17:32.617 --> 17:35.347
Uh-huh. Well, I don't think
you can do that.

17:35.420 --> 17:39.857
- Well, I think I can.
- Of course you can. The customer's always right.

17:39.924 --> 17:42.950
So, you'll give Earl his job back?

17:43.027 --> 17:46.963
Well, the fry cook burnt off
his finger this morning...

17:47.031 --> 17:49.932
so... sure.

17:50.001 --> 17:53.562
By the way, don't have the fish sticks.
We haven't found it.

17:56.274 --> 17:59.766
You hear that, Earl?
You got your job back. You can go to work.

17:59.844 --> 18:01.971
Wait. You mean right now?

18:02.046 --> 18:04.207
But I'll miss <i>WKRP.</i>

18:07.552 --> 18:10.043
- Okay, man, here are the keys.
- Oh, bitchin'!

18:11.356 --> 18:13.290
You know...

18:13.358 --> 18:17.294
I was gonna give this car to my son
on his 16th birthday.

18:17.362 --> 18:20.126
But then my old lady
took him and split.

18:21.199 --> 18:24.259
Yeah, wow. Sad story.
Keys, please?

18:25.603 --> 18:28.936
- I can't sell you the car, man.
- Oh, man!

18:29.941 --> 18:32.705
Ah, I guess I understand.

18:32.777 --> 18:37.077
Thanks, man.
Hyde, I want you to have this car.

18:38.650 --> 18:42.177
What? No! You just said
that you couldn't sell the car.

18:42.253 --> 18:45.654
Well, I'm not selling it.
I'm giving it to him, man.

18:45.723 --> 18:47.657
He's family.

18:47.725 --> 18:50.216
He's the son I never had.

18:50.295 --> 18:52.991
You just said you had a son!

18:55.266 --> 18:58.702
Yeah, and Hyde's the son
I <i>never</i> had.

19:00.104 --> 19:03.301
Hey, Leo, man, thanks.
You're the best.

19:03.374 --> 19:07.208
The car, the love,
the wicked burn on Kelso.

19:08.580 --> 19:11.071
Hey, man, need a lift?

19:14.886 --> 19:17.821
- Eric, what are you doing here?
- I'll tell you what I'm doing here, Donna.

19:17.889 --> 19:21.256
I'm here to say who's who
and what's what to Jerry Thunder.

19:21.326 --> 19:24.762
Eric, you can't talk to Jerry.
He's on the air.

19:24.829 --> 19:26.763
Oh. Fine.

19:26.831 --> 19:29.265
Then I guess I'll just have to wait.

19:29.334 --> 19:32.394
But let me tell you something...
I'll be fuming.

19:34.539 --> 19:37.007
This is Jerry Thunder...

19:37.075 --> 19:39.737
signing off.

19:39.811 --> 19:42.712
And I'll see you around The Sound.

19:42.780 --> 19:44.714
All right!

19:44.782 --> 19:48.718
Whoo! Let's get Mr. Big FM Stud
out here right now!

19:48.786 --> 19:50.947
Yeah! Big time!

19:51.022 --> 19:53.752
Eric, why are you being weird?

19:53.825 --> 19:56.259
Donna, I'm gonna make a long story short.

19:56.327 --> 19:59.694
I'm here to kick a little deejay ass,
so have a seat.

19:59.764 --> 20:01.698
Hey, Donna.

20:01.766 --> 20:03.996
And this must be
the boyfriend, Eric.

20:04.068 --> 20:06.628
Hi. I'm Jerry Thunder.

20:09.807 --> 20:11.798
<i>You're</i> Jerry Thunder?

20:13.044 --> 20:16.036
Well, that's just great!

20:17.315 --> 20:20.250
Check out Jerry Thunder!

20:20.318 --> 20:22.752
Hey, you kids,
the night is young.

20:22.820 --> 20:25.618
You guys up for a game
of Dungeons & Dragons?

20:27.792 --> 20:30.522
I'll let you be Mandar, the half-elf.

20:32.030 --> 20:34.430
Oh, well. Another time, perhaps.
Good night.

20:39.404 --> 20:41.395
So, <i>that's</i> Jerry Thunder?

20:42.840 --> 20:45.968
It really turns me off
when you're so insecure like this.

20:46.044 --> 20:47.978
We've been together long enough...

20:48.046 --> 20:51.607
where it's either you don't get it
or you don't trust me.

20:51.683 --> 20:55.016
- No, Donna, I trust you.
- Well, then you don't get it.

20:55.086 --> 20:58.522
I finally have something that's
really good in my life right now...

20:58.590 --> 21:01.957
and if you can't handle that,
then we have a problem.

21:02.026 --> 21:03.960
So, Eric, do we have a problem?

21:04.028 --> 21:06.121
No, we do not have a problem.

21:06.197 --> 21:08.131
Good.

21:08.199 --> 21:11.635
'Cause I broke my nail on a Styx album,
I didn't get to meet Alice Cooper...

21:11.703 --> 21:13.864
and I am super pissed.

21:13.938 --> 21:16.065
Yeah, well, you know...

21:19.110 --> 21:21.203
you have a really cool job.

21:23.014 --> 21:24.948
Yeah, I do, don't I?

21:25.016 --> 21:27.849
REO Speedwagon's
coming in next week.

21:29.053 --> 21:31.544
I'm gonna see
if they'll sign my boobs.

21:33.157 --> 21:35.318
Now we have a problem.

21:39.430 --> 21:44.367
Okay, suddenly you're face to face
with the Dragon of Fear.

21:44.435 --> 21:48.872
No! I should have worn
my Gauntlet of Ogre Strength.

21:48.940 --> 21:51.875
Dumb! Any ideas, Mandar?

21:54.445 --> 21:57.380
Well, there's my Rod of Cancellation,
but it's chancy.

21:58.449 --> 22:00.383
Yeah.

22:00.451 --> 22:03.386
You know, a girl once promised
to play with us, but she didn't show up.

22:03.454 --> 22:06.389
Cheer up,
King Zintar the Great.

22:06.457 --> 22:09.392
Let's get out there
and slay that dragon.
