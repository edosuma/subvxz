WEBVTT

00:07.000 --> 00:09.080
'Ex on the Beach is back.'

00:10.560 --> 00:13.960
'This time, they're ballin' in Bali.'

00:14.040 --> 00:15.920
Party!

00:17.720 --> 00:20.400
'Eight sexy singles
looking for love.'

00:21.880 --> 00:23.560
He's the only person I loved.

00:25.080 --> 00:27.160
I love this girl.
I'm gonna be with her.

00:28.080 --> 00:32.200
'By getting over the ghosts
of their pasts on the beach of doom.'

00:35.680 --> 00:37.160
Fuck's sake.

00:37.240 --> 00:38.600
(shouting)

00:38.680 --> 00:40.880
He better not get with anyone.
I'd go mad.

00:40.960 --> 00:43.280
'There'll be tantrums...'

00:43.360 --> 00:44.880
I am fucking fuming!

00:46.520 --> 00:49.160
You shagged my fucking good mate
behind my back.

00:49.240 --> 00:50.600
'...trauma...'

00:50.680 --> 00:53.320
(shouting)
Come on, then.

00:53.400 --> 00:56.640
'...and as always,
the Tablet of Terror is on hand

00:56.720 --> 00:59.160
to cause misery...'

00:59.240 --> 01:02.240
I'm sick of being like this
every single time with you.

01:02.320 --> 01:03.640
'...and mischief.'

01:03.720 --> 01:04.920
Bye!

01:05.000 --> 01:08.560
'Love hurts, and it hurts like hell.'

01:08.640 --> 01:10.560
'Two exes have arrived.'

01:10.640 --> 01:12.200
'Whose...'

01:12.280 --> 01:14.360
Honk, honk! (laughs)

01:14.440 --> 01:15.840
'...ex...'

01:15.920 --> 01:17.400
Bring it on, pencil dick.

01:17.480 --> 01:20.600
'...is...'
I fucking love it!

01:20.680 --> 01:22.320
'...next?'

01:22.400 --> 01:24.360

02:08.000 --> 02:10.120
Oi, oi!
Oi, oi!

02:10.199 --> 02:11.280
You're in trouble.

02:11.360 --> 02:13.240
Hi, you all right?

02:13.320 --> 02:16.720
Marty, surprise,
the princess is here!

02:16.800 --> 02:17.880
What the fuck?

02:17.960 --> 02:20.200
Just cos obviously
I swam from Newcastle.

02:20.280 --> 02:22.920
I see Chloe
and I can't think about how I feel,

02:23.000 --> 02:24.920
cos of them ridiculous armbands.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.160
Hang on, arm bands?
Can you not swim?

02:27.240 --> 02:29.960
Thank fuck it's not my ex,
I'm so relieved.

02:30.040 --> 02:31.800
Hello, you all right?

02:31.880 --> 02:35.520
Fucking hell,
I heard Chloe's a nutcase.

02:35.600 --> 02:40.040
Hello?! I'm Chloe and you might know
me from Geordie Shore.

02:40.120 --> 02:42.480
I love Marty.
I wanna get back with him.

02:42.560 --> 02:45.720
If Marty gets with anyone else,
I dunno how I'm gonna feel.

02:45.800 --> 02:48.160
Me and Marty did have sex recently.

02:48.240 --> 02:51.120
I left without saying goodbye.
What a fucking player.

02:52.880 --> 02:57.160
My reason for coming on is to see
if there's anything still there.

02:57.240 --> 03:01.000
If anyone gets in my way,
this is what's gonna happen.

03:02.240 --> 03:04.320
Dead. Goodbye.

03:05.960 --> 03:08.040
Have you had sex with anyone?
Nah.

03:08.120 --> 03:11.760
I've only been here two nights.
I'm not gonna lie, it's surprising.

03:11.840 --> 03:14.840
(laughter)
I would love to give it a go.

03:14.920 --> 03:17.920
Me and him are literally
from the same clone.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.280
(both) Clone.

03:20.360 --> 03:23.560
How come it's never worked out?
We never tried to be together.

03:23.640 --> 03:25.080
We gave it a go in Magaluf.

03:25.160 --> 03:27.560
Hardly. You were shagging birds
the next day.

03:27.640 --> 03:29.000
Marty!

03:29.080 --> 03:30.720
What's been going on then?

03:32.840 --> 03:36.880
I've been like... I've kissed her.
What the fuck?!

03:39.360 --> 03:44.000
Is she joking? Marty's my ex. I'm not
gonna watch him and her neck on.

03:46.080 --> 03:47.960
(Tablet of Terror buzzes)

03:48.040 --> 03:49.920
Oh!

03:50.000 --> 03:51.320
Sorry.
What's that?

03:51.400 --> 03:53.720
Chloe... Hi.
Hiya.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.600
"Welcome to the beach."

03:55.680 --> 03:59.120
"A date for you and Matt to see
if you're to each other's taste."

03:59.200 --> 04:02.000
Right. We're fucking off.
Bye.Ciao.

04:02.080 --> 04:04.440
I won't lie,
I'm confused about the girl.

04:04.520 --> 04:06.880
History between
me and Chloe is fucked up.

04:06.960 --> 04:09.240
I'd love to say everything
is gonna be fine,

04:09.320 --> 04:12.400
but I really couldn't,
cos I dunno what she's gonna do.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.839
'While Marty comes to terms
with the arrival of his ex,

04:16.920 --> 04:19.519
someone else is still
hung up on theirs.'

04:19.600 --> 04:23.520
I bought Brad everything, like, the
second day I bought him trainers.

04:23.600 --> 04:24.720
He bought me nothing.

04:24.800 --> 04:27.120
I feel bad for Nicole,
I love the girl to bits.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.600
Brad seems like a prick.

04:28.680 --> 04:31.560
Bought nothing for Valentine's,
never got anything.

04:32.760 --> 04:34.640
So, he's never bought you a card?

04:34.720 --> 04:38.440
He bought me a Christmas card once.
My 21st birthday, he never come.

04:38.520 --> 04:40.840
He didn't turn up
to your 21st birthday meal?

04:40.920 --> 04:43.080
Oh. Sounds like a knob
if I'm honest.

04:43.160 --> 04:46.120
She's a young girl, clearly upset.
I don't like to see it.

04:46.200 --> 04:50.040
He went out of his way and got me
flowers when he cheated on me.

04:50.120 --> 04:53.840
Fucking hell. Sorry flowers.
From the petrol station?

04:53.920 --> 04:56.160
Interflora.
I went on to see how much.

04:56.240 --> 04:58.920
He spent 30 quid.
He got the cheapest one.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.200
'Looks like
you're well shot of him, Nicole.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.520
'Speaking of shots..."

05:05.600 --> 05:07.040
Ace.
Aww, peev o' clock.

05:07.120 --> 05:09.440
Shots on the table,
this is gonna be fun.

05:09.520 --> 05:10.960
Oi, oi!

05:13.240 --> 05:14.960
What you doing?
I need some help.

05:15.040 --> 05:18.240
Fuck knows what these shots are,
but they are pure lifting.

05:18.320 --> 05:20.480
They taste like tadpoles.

05:20.560 --> 05:22.680
Hang on, you buzzing you're here?
I am.

05:22.760 --> 05:25.240
I'm not gonna lie,
I dunno how I feel about her.

05:25.320 --> 05:27.480
She was proud to say she necked on.

05:27.560 --> 05:29.640
I just think, like, have sympathy.

05:29.720 --> 05:31.800
They was in the penthouse.
Were they?

05:32.880 --> 05:34.640
Fati has pissed me off today.

05:34.720 --> 05:36.720
I feel she's got
no respect for girls,

05:36.800 --> 05:39.880
or no girl code
and I'm not about that life.

05:39.960 --> 05:42.600
I thought they were gonna shag.
Why didn't they?

05:42.680 --> 05:46.520
Would you be bothered if they did?
I'm not jealous of ruler arse.

05:46.600 --> 05:50.440
What if he said,
"Listen, Chloe, I like this girl."

05:50.520 --> 05:52.040
"Go on with the flat ass."

05:52.120 --> 05:54.240
If you do doggy,
you have nowt to look at.

05:54.320 --> 05:57.040
That's what I'll say.
Chloe says she's not jealous.

05:57.120 --> 05:58.480
She 100% is.

05:58.560 --> 06:00.680
Chloe's here for one thing, Marty.

06:00.760 --> 06:02.720
When was the last time
you cracked on?

06:02.800 --> 06:06.280
Erm, a couple of weeks ago.
A couple of weeks ago?!

06:06.360 --> 06:09.600
Shit, that's fucking... I thought
you were gonna say months.

06:09.680 --> 06:12.320
No. It's cos we were drunk
on a night out.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.880
If you get drunk tonight,
what's gonna happen?

06:14.960 --> 06:17.920
When I'm drunk I don't know
what I'm doing, so who knows?

06:19.840 --> 06:22.360
I wanna meet the...
Do you know what this means?

06:22.440 --> 06:25.000
Pester-icide. Pestrians.

06:25.080 --> 06:29.080
I learned it in my theory test.
Pestrian. Pestree-i. Pestrian.

06:29.160 --> 06:31.840
Are you speaking Spanish?
It's a person.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.680
A pedestrian?
(both laugh)

06:35.760 --> 06:38.200
A pestrian? I like that one.
I'm gonna use that.

06:38.280 --> 06:41.080
Why don't you fuck off?
How did you pass theory?

06:41.160 --> 06:42.360
Was it your ninth time?

06:42.440 --> 06:45.360
(both laugh)
I haven't passed my theory.

06:45.440 --> 06:48.160
(both laugh)

06:52.520 --> 06:54.040
I think it's Marty's ex.

06:54.120 --> 06:57.080
It's definitely gonna make Fati
sleep with him more.

06:57.160 --> 06:58.160
Just to rub it in.

06:58.240 --> 07:02.560
I hope the ex comes in
and pisses on her chips.

07:02.640 --> 07:06.240
I've held it in today, yesterday,
given him the benefit of the doubt,

07:06.320 --> 07:07.600
but I won't forget it.

07:07.680 --> 07:09.920
Talking of exes,
there's no feelings?

07:10.000 --> 07:11.360
No.
Honestly?

07:11.440 --> 07:14.240
So, Lee, how would you feel
if I was to make a move?

07:14.320 --> 07:16.760
'That's a bit left field, Dean.'

07:16.840 --> 07:17.920
Awkward.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.160
Savannah might not be happy.
Just putting it out there.

07:23.120 --> 07:25.920
Why is Dean asking that?
Are you saying you want her?

07:26.000 --> 07:28.920
No. I was just saying
hypothetically.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.960
But why would you
hypothetically say that?

07:32.040 --> 07:34.840
Shall I rephrase it?
It's been and gone now.

07:34.920 --> 07:36.640
There's no point.
Whatever.

07:36.720 --> 07:40.120
Dean asking Lee if he'd mind me
cracking on with him

07:40.200 --> 07:43.600
is a bit weird,
cos Savannah's sat right there.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.800
Ooh.
This is a bit awkward.

07:45.880 --> 07:48.520
This is so fucking awkward.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.760
Last night,
Dean jumps into Che's bed.

07:50.840 --> 07:53.680
If Savannah finds out,
who knows what's gonna happen?

07:53.760 --> 07:55.240
(laughs)

07:55.320 --> 07:58.040
If Dean tries it on with Che,
he can fuck off.

07:58.120 --> 08:02.120
I'll never speak to the guy again.
I'm not being mugged off.

08:02.200 --> 08:06.360
'Oh, Savannah, being made a mug out
of is the least of your worries

08:06.440 --> 08:10.240
when the next ex arrives
to make fools out of you all.'

08:10.320 --> 08:12.360
(evil laughter)

08:16.320 --> 08:18.000
It's wet, but we'll have a chat.

08:18.080 --> 08:22.280
I clearly pissed off Savannah, but
I'm sure I can worm my way back in.

08:22.360 --> 08:24.480
Looked like you got a bit aggy.

08:24.560 --> 08:29.200
Yeah, well, I dunno why you'd ask
about getting with Che.

08:29.280 --> 08:31.640
Out of all the girls
that Dean can fancy,

08:31.720 --> 08:33.039
why did it have to be Che?

08:33.120 --> 08:35.320
I meant, "What would you
do with the boys?"

08:35.400 --> 08:37.720
I said, "What would you do
if I got with her?"

08:37.799 --> 08:41.799
How would you react? I was trying
to see if it would bother him.

08:41.880 --> 08:44.600
'Hmm. I'm not sure
she's gonna buy that.'

08:44.680 --> 08:48.720
Seriously, like, you just meant it
working out what he was thinking?

08:48.800 --> 08:51.960
Or was there anything behind that?
No, I was just...

08:52.040 --> 08:54.960
Cos it sounded a lot like
you were trying to get with Che.

08:55.040 --> 08:59.440
As long as that was what you meant,
it's fine.

08:59.520 --> 09:03.080
Fuck me, I've pulled this back.
She might be in my bed tonight.

09:03.160 --> 09:04.560
Sure?
Yeah.

09:04.640 --> 09:07.000
So, obviously,
that's a massive relief

09:07.080 --> 09:09.200
that he's into me and not Che.

09:09.280 --> 09:12.800
He did just genuinely
want to know what Lee thought.

09:12.880 --> 09:15.480
'Yeah, course he did, Savannah.'

09:22.040 --> 09:24.080
Whistle posse!

09:24.160 --> 09:25.320
(all cheer)

09:25.400 --> 09:27.280
Well, how did you
get on at the beach?

09:27.360 --> 09:29.320
Chloe, mate.

09:29.400 --> 09:32.160
Oi, mate, honestly,
she was in such a good mood.

09:32.240 --> 09:35.160
She walked on the beach
and made us laugh straight away.

09:35.240 --> 09:36.240
It's my ex bird.

09:36.320 --> 09:39.280
Did you tell her you and Fatima
had been cracking on?

09:39.360 --> 09:42.000
I was like,
"Me and Fatima have cracked on."

09:42.080 --> 09:45.800
She was all right, she wasn't funny.
It will be different if she sees it.

09:45.880 --> 09:48.840
Aye, mate, like, she was sound,
but she was sober.

09:48.920 --> 09:52.920
If she's on the date getting pissed,
she's gonna be a different person.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.520
Chloe coming to the villa, things
will change. It's a nightmare.

09:56.600 --> 10:00.840
I know you've had arguments, but
you've seen nothing like this girl.

10:00.920 --> 10:04.080
Marty and Chloe's history is intense.
They like each other.

10:04.160 --> 10:06.760
This is fucking everything up.
Are you over her?

10:06.840 --> 10:10.200
I'm over her in that way, but
I'll never be over her as a person.

10:10.280 --> 10:12.560
You got love for her.
I can't not talk to her.

10:12.640 --> 10:13.720
It's impossible.

10:13.800 --> 10:16.720
Anyways, to the calm
before the storm.

10:18.320 --> 10:20.200
Phwoar.
Fuck.

10:26.080 --> 10:29.720
I can see Chloe kicking off.
A little battle on your hands, Fati.

10:29.800 --> 10:31.880
I feel sorry for her if she fights.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.160
At the end of the day...

10:33.240 --> 10:35.720
I have respect.
I wouldn't start anything.

10:35.800 --> 10:37.760
You didn't show that
on the first day.

10:37.840 --> 10:40.000
You gotta practice what you preach.

10:40.080 --> 10:41.280
You wanna start again?

10:41.360 --> 10:42.440
Here she goes again.

10:42.520 --> 10:45.640
I'm saying you can't go on,
"Don't disrespect..."

10:45.720 --> 10:48.880
Listen, I said, "If I wanna
get with your ex, I will."

10:48.960 --> 10:51.520
Fatima, you're saying
you're gonna fuck her ex?

10:51.600 --> 10:53.520
I do what I want.
So disrespectful.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.520
Wasn't respectful two minutes ago.

10:55.600 --> 10:58.360
I'm not having shit. Bring her on.
I'm fucking ready.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.920
Shut your fucking mouth.
You're pushing it.

11:01.000 --> 11:06.520
Every time Fatima argues with me, my
head just falls off, it's rolling.

11:06.600 --> 11:08.080
My ex is a dickhead, yeah,

11:08.160 --> 11:10.920
but he's not that much of a dickhead
to get with you.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.120
Don't fucking...

11:12.200 --> 11:15.120
You know what? I'm gonna get
with your ex to piss you off.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.520
I can get him like that
in two seconds.

11:19.400 --> 11:22.040
I'm so mad my blood is boiling.

11:22.120 --> 11:24.320
Who the fuck does she think she is?

11:24.400 --> 11:27.560
Honestly, you are pissing me off
next level.

11:30.720 --> 11:33.000
What you saying?
She keeps coming behind me

11:33.080 --> 11:35.800
like a fucking creepy cat
and it's pissing me off.

11:35.880 --> 11:38.080
Step the fuck back from me now.

11:38.160 --> 11:40.160
Get this bitch away from me now.

11:40.240 --> 11:41.320
Get her away.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.560
Fucking get her away from me now!

11:43.640 --> 11:46.160
Who the fuck do you think you are?

11:46.240 --> 11:48.000
I hate her.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.360
Honestly. You're ugly!

11:51.440 --> 11:52.560
You are a fat bitch.

11:52.640 --> 11:53.840
A fat bitch?

11:53.920 --> 11:56.560
I'm a size eight.
I'm a fucking size eight.

11:58.400 --> 12:00.720
I'm not gonna have anyone
talk to me like that

12:00.800 --> 12:02.720
and less a fat bitch like her.

12:02.800 --> 12:05.640
Who is that?
Like, what even is that?

12:14.280 --> 12:17.360
Oh, there they are! Nice to see
you aren't holding hands.

12:17.440 --> 12:18.880
Ooh.
She nearly fell over?

12:18.960 --> 12:20.480
Hello.

12:21.640 --> 12:23.920
Chloe arrives
and she's happy to see me

12:24.000 --> 12:27.800
which is a good thing,
cos if she wasn't, I'd be off.

12:27.880 --> 12:30.120
So, tell us, how did the date go?

12:30.200 --> 12:33.080
Basically, Matt is the funniest
person I've ever met.

12:33.160 --> 12:34.560
(all) Ooh!

12:34.640 --> 12:37.160
You know what is it Chloe?
You coulda shagged him

12:37.240 --> 12:40.040
and that wouldn't hurt,
but the fact you said that...

12:40.120 --> 12:42.000
What the fuck have I missed then?

12:42.080 --> 12:45.440
I've been saying to Chloe
it's a happy villa and shit.

12:45.520 --> 12:46.800
Is it not?

12:46.880 --> 12:51.440
Fati walks in and goes, "If your lad
walks in, I don't care how he looks,

12:51.520 --> 12:52.880
I'm just gonna shag him."

12:52.960 --> 12:54.400
You're Nicole?

12:54.480 --> 12:56.680
So, yous two don't like each other?
No.

12:56.760 --> 13:01.240
I'm not gonna lie, Nicole,
I already know she's a pure snake.

13:01.320 --> 13:02.360
(blows raspberry)

13:05.760 --> 13:08.360
Listen... Let me talk. Let me talk.

13:08.440 --> 13:11.400
I'm not getting into it get,
I told you not push it.

13:11.480 --> 13:15.480
I tried to have conversation,
but you wouldn't have it.

13:15.560 --> 13:18.640
Fatima and Nicole
have kicked off yet again.

13:18.720 --> 13:20.960
These two need to give it
a fucking rest.

13:21.040 --> 13:23.600
You should appreciate
the fact I'm honest.

13:23.680 --> 13:26.280
You're not, you keep
contradicting yourself.

13:26.360 --> 13:29.120
Answer the question.
Chill out.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.440
I'm gonna wang this shit
at you in a minute.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.680
Let it go, I'm bored. I'm so bored.

13:33.760 --> 13:37.080
Fati has literally started
doing my fucking head in.

13:37.160 --> 13:39.760
Every day she's kicking off
for no reason.

13:39.840 --> 13:43.560
Let's make the new girl welcome,
let's talk about it another day.

13:43.640 --> 13:45.400
We'll get mortal.
(laughter)

13:45.480 --> 13:47.280
Marty! Marty!

13:49.040 --> 13:51.000
(laughter)

13:51.080 --> 13:53.800
I'm not gonna be able
to deal with these two.

13:53.880 --> 13:55.040
Have you not?

13:55.120 --> 13:57.600
Marty's making
a massive effort with us.

13:57.680 --> 13:59.680
I'm not gonna lie, it feels so good.

13:59.760 --> 14:01.440
He's never, ever like this.

14:01.520 --> 14:03.000
When were you two together?

14:03.080 --> 14:06.320
Me and Marty are friends.
You said you fucked two weeks ago!

14:06.400 --> 14:08.320
(laughter)

14:08.400 --> 14:09.720
The cat is out the bag!

14:09.800 --> 14:12.600
So far in this villa,
the girls have been dry,

14:12.680 --> 14:15.400
but Chloe has got
a great personality.

14:15.480 --> 14:19.840
If Chloe was to crack on,
I'd definitely be up for it.

14:19.920 --> 14:22.240
'Jordan's got the hots for Chloe,

14:22.320 --> 14:26.440
but who will send the villa in to
meltdown when the next ex arrives?'

14:35.280 --> 14:37.480
To welcome her,
we'll do a drinking game.

14:37.560 --> 14:40.040
Spin the fucking bottle.
Spin the sniff.

14:40.120 --> 14:44.720
This is the perfect way
to get pure mortal and neck on!

14:44.800 --> 14:46.560
( indistinct )

14:46.640 --> 14:48.240
Deano and Che, step right up.

14:51.240 --> 14:53.320
Love is in the air!

14:53.400 --> 14:56.360
Hand grab and everything.
What the fuck was that?

14:58.200 --> 14:59.720
Oh, Chloe!

14:59.800 --> 15:03.040
Trust the fucking bottle
to land on me and Marty!

15:03.120 --> 15:06.840
Now we've gotta neck on,
what a shame.

15:08.080 --> 15:09.080
Oh, me and you?

15:09.160 --> 15:11.320
I'm not one to let down Mr Bottle.

15:11.400 --> 15:14.880
So, fuck it. I hope you
don't catch feelings, though.

15:15.880 --> 15:20.160
Chloe is kissing Marty, I think
she enjoys making me jealous.

15:22.400 --> 15:24.960
Fati looks annoyed me and Marty
are necking on.

15:25.040 --> 15:27.280
It sucks to be you, Chicka!

15:28.360 --> 15:30.560
This is so confusing for us.

15:30.640 --> 15:33.760
I'm starting to think, does he
likes us? We need to chat.

15:33.840 --> 15:36.880
We'll see how things go,
but there's something there.

15:36.960 --> 15:40.080
Them two? Yeah. You can tell
by how he dressed tonight.

15:40.160 --> 15:41.520
There's something there.

15:44.720 --> 15:48.720
Right. Marty, this is what gets me
so frustrated with you,

15:48.800 --> 15:52.440
is that these psychos....
I know I'm a psycho, but that?

15:52.520 --> 15:53.560
I wanna bang her.

15:53.640 --> 15:56.280
This has always been confusing
about me and Marty,

15:56.360 --> 16:00.360
he always pulls these random girls,
so me and him argue all the time.

16:00.440 --> 16:01.800
Why can't we work it out?

16:01.880 --> 16:04.360
Why get with her
when you can get with me?

16:04.440 --> 16:06.000
Look at that arse!

16:08.120 --> 16:11.760
It's a nice arse.
So, why that pancake fuck there?

16:11.840 --> 16:15.240
I'm not trying to get in a
relationship, I kissed her.

16:15.320 --> 16:17.400
Me and Chloe are having
a bit of a moment

16:17.480 --> 16:19.040
and my head's fell off a bit.

16:19.120 --> 16:21.280
I'm gonna have to bin Fati clean off.

16:21.360 --> 16:23.360
Think about what I've said, Marty.

16:23.440 --> 16:26.520
That's the first time you've ever
said anything like that.

16:26.600 --> 16:29.240
So, now I know. It's in my head.

16:29.320 --> 16:32.040
I've been really nervous
about seeing Marty.

16:32.120 --> 16:35.120
When me and him are together,
it's so confusing.

16:35.200 --> 16:37.480
I don't actually know
what's ever going on.

16:38.520 --> 16:40.160
Will you make us a drink?

16:40.240 --> 16:43.480
No, I'm not your fucking butler,
you fuck.

16:45.480 --> 16:47.920
Fati...
Yeah?Come here.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.880
The fact that Fati's starting
to get really personal

16:50.960 --> 16:52.600
has pure turned us off her.

16:52.680 --> 16:55.400
The first day on the beach,
I proper fancied you.

16:55.480 --> 16:58.880
But in the days it went on, like,
you've got really fucking nasty.

16:58.960 --> 17:02.400
Towards Nicole, like, you called
her fat and made her insecure.

17:02.480 --> 17:05.280
Marty, she was nasty first,
she said I was ugly.

17:05.359 --> 17:08.640
Just cos Nicole has been crying,
everyone is taking her side,

17:08.720 --> 17:10.680
but she said nasty things
to me first.

17:10.760 --> 17:14.520
I know we're laid back, friends,
but the kissing has to stop.

17:14.599 --> 17:17.040
It's a bit of a coincidence,
Chloe's walked in.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.720
Marty's using it as an excuse.

17:18.800 --> 17:21.280
Fuck off, I'm not listening
to this bullshit.

17:23.680 --> 17:27.920
I'm not... I'm a dickhead am I?
See you later.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Love you.

17:30.080 --> 17:34.720
It's fair to say, after tonight,
me and Fati are done.

17:40.000 --> 17:45.440
'With Marty and Fati now over,
the rest are calling it a night.'

17:45.520 --> 17:47.640
You upset today, ain't you, girl?

17:47.720 --> 17:50.160
You all right, innit?
Yeah, thank you.

17:50.240 --> 17:51.800
I feel so bad for Nicole.

17:51.880 --> 17:55.000
Fatima gets under her skin,
and she genuinely loves her ex.

17:55.080 --> 17:57.160
Sleep well.
Yeah, you too.

17:57.240 --> 17:59.320
Don't let it play
on your mind, yeah?

18:09.800 --> 18:11.880
Do you go out clubbing much?

18:11.960 --> 18:12.960
Never.

18:13.040 --> 18:14.320
Do you not?
Not really.

18:15.600 --> 18:17.480
What about bars and stuff?

18:17.560 --> 18:21.840
Yeah, like, I prefer going to a bar
or sitting in a pub or something.

18:25.720 --> 18:27.160
Savannah is boring as fuck.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.720
I need a bit of banter.
I can't deal with this.

18:34.720 --> 18:37.400
(whistles) 'That would bore
anyone to sleep.'

18:42.320 --> 18:44.720
'What are you doing
down there, Chloe?'

18:47.480 --> 18:50.440
The more time I spend with Marty,
the more feelings I get.

18:50.520 --> 18:53.920
It's like having one chicken nugget
and wanting the box.

19:03.400 --> 19:06.560
Right now, I'm just enjoying
Chloe's company, but...

19:06.640 --> 19:10.200
...when we start getting closer
and flirting, we end up shagging.

19:10.280 --> 19:12.320
Nee one in this villa needs that.

19:17.320 --> 19:22.280
'As Chloe returns to her bed,
everyone is going to sleep.'

19:24.360 --> 19:27.480
'Ooh, spoke too soon.'

19:27.560 --> 19:29.680
Get up! I want a word with everyone.

19:29.760 --> 19:31.560
What the fuck is this bitch doing?

19:31.640 --> 19:34.440
Marty said to me everyone agrees
I'm nasty.

19:34.520 --> 19:37.360
Apparently everyone forgot
the things Nicole said.

19:37.440 --> 19:40.640
Just cos Nicole has been crying,
the guys are backing her up,

19:40.720 --> 19:43.920
cos she's weaker than me.
That's fucking ridiculous.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.320
It's really unfair. Think about
the things she said to me.

19:47.400 --> 19:51.320
I ain't got a clue what she's on
about. She is a proper wind up.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.880
That's really unfair, guys.
Goodnight.

19:58.800 --> 20:02.120
What did she say?
Something about nasty Nicole.

20:11.400 --> 20:14.000
(laughter)

20:17.720 --> 20:21.120
I'm so sick of this, Fatima,
Fatima, Fatima, I'm sick of it.

20:21.200 --> 20:25.280
Like, I'm bored of it, but she opens
her mouth and pushes me.

20:31.080 --> 20:34.640
Nicole's really good at barking,
but I'm sorry, I'm good at biting.

20:36.320 --> 20:37.360
What the fuck?

20:38.360 --> 20:42.160
(shouting)

20:47.520 --> 20:50.560
They had bother, but I never thought
it would get this far,

20:50.640 --> 20:52.800
pulling each other
all over the bedroom.

20:52.880 --> 20:54.160
When did that happen?

20:58.480 --> 21:00.840
Fucking hell, man.

21:00.920 --> 21:04.320
She's a fucking psychopath.
O-M-fucking-G.

21:04.400 --> 21:08.120
Nicole's gonna have to fucking go.
No girl's gonna feel safe.

21:08.200 --> 21:11.320
'You're right, Marty.
Cheerio, Nicole.'

21:14.000 --> 21:17.080
Fatima, I think she's
a lonely little bitch

21:17.160 --> 21:20.640
that likes to get on everyone's exes
and piss everyone off.

21:20.720 --> 21:24.240
And to be honest, she's pissed
me off. I swear to God...

21:28.440 --> 21:32.200
(sultry doo-wop music)

21:55.760 --> 21:57.800
(wave crashes)

22:05.560 --> 22:08.960
What Nicole did last night
was very cold, very clinical.

22:09.040 --> 22:11.920
I'd never do that to anyone.
She's an evil bitch.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.080
I'm a bit shocked.
Are you shocked?

22:14.160 --> 22:16.640
Out of the girls here,
I thought she was nice.

22:16.720 --> 22:17.760
She was a nice girl.

22:17.840 --> 22:21.400
Gutted that Nicole's gone. We got
on well. She's a lovely girl.

22:21.480 --> 22:23.120
At least we got to see her fight.

22:23.200 --> 22:24.560
(laughter)

22:26.760 --> 22:28.480
We shared a kiss, not gonna lie.

22:34.160 --> 22:37.760
There is always gonna be something
very special between me and Marty

22:37.840 --> 22:39.480
no-one else will ever have.

22:39.560 --> 22:43.080
I can't believe we've kissed
the first night, it's so confusing.

22:43.160 --> 22:44.920
It was a welcome kiss.
(laughter)

22:45.000 --> 22:47.800
Every girl's gonna get one.

22:47.880 --> 22:51.440
If Marty and Chloe wanna crack on,
I'm not bothered. She's welcome.

22:56.320 --> 23:00.600
I wanna ask, do you think anything's
happening with you and Sav?

23:00.680 --> 23:04.080
No.
I think it's for the sake of it.

23:04.160 --> 23:06.760
I'm not used to having
to graft hard. I do like her.

23:06.840 --> 23:10.440
There's only so much a man can take.
She's the most boring girl ever.

23:10.520 --> 23:12.080
(laughter)

23:12.160 --> 23:14.120
Seriously?
Yeah.

23:14.200 --> 23:16.280
Savannah has got fuck all to say.

23:16.360 --> 23:18.760
Knows she's boring.
She shouldn't be here.

23:18.840 --> 23:22.440
I wanna call her 'Fence'. I ask
if she's OK, she's like, "Dunno."

23:22.520 --> 23:24.200
(laughter)

23:26.000 --> 23:28.800
What are you thinking about Dean?
Are you gonna fuck?

23:28.880 --> 23:31.240
Definitely.
Like, he's a nice guy.

23:31.320 --> 23:33.120
Fit, cheeky, funny.

23:33.200 --> 23:37.200
I'm sure Dean's gonna be OK
to wait and graft for me,

23:37.280 --> 23:38.960
cos that's what it's gonna take.

23:39.040 --> 23:42.480
Yeah, he's fit.
I think he'd be a good shag.

23:42.560 --> 23:44.680
This is a bit awkward.

23:44.760 --> 23:49.040
Savannah is saying she fancies Dean,
but I know he fancies me.

23:49.120 --> 23:51.600
This is like the honeymoon period.

23:51.680 --> 23:55.480
Like, I've slept in his bed twice.
It's nice to have someone there.

23:56.960 --> 24:01.360
Che's not pulling anyone, she's
just like, kissed you, kissed you.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.560
You'd be better off
cracking on with Che.

24:03.640 --> 24:06.080
(clicks tongue)
Boys, we need some fresh meat.

24:06.160 --> 24:07.920
We do, man.
We need fresh meat.

24:08.000 --> 24:11.120
We don't need beef burgers,
we need sirloin.

24:11.200 --> 24:12.800
(laughter)

24:12.880 --> 24:18.240
All the guys are gagging for a new
ex, a fit, tall, sexy supermodel.

24:18.320 --> 24:22.080
I'm gonna cut a hole in this table.
(laughter)

24:24.400 --> 24:26.920
'Careful what you wish for,
cos the next ex

24:27.000 --> 24:29.720
is arriving sooner than you think.'

24:29.800 --> 24:33.920
'T minus one hour.' (evil laughter)

24:38.280 --> 24:41.280
If I'm honest, I want a bird
to come in. No offence.

24:41.360 --> 24:43.920
I think the lads need
a bit more excitement.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.880
(Tablet of Terror buzzes)

24:45.960 --> 24:47.400
(all groan)

24:47.480 --> 24:49.960
Tablet of Terror, you little shit.

24:50.040 --> 24:52.520
It's date time for Marty and Chloe.

24:52.600 --> 24:53.800
(all) Ooh!

24:53.880 --> 24:57.400
Will you cook up some romance,
or just satay friends?

24:59.480 --> 25:01.440
Me and Marty's never been on a date.

25:01.520 --> 25:02.960
I know, it's weird.

25:03.040 --> 25:06.640
How dirty is that? She bangs us,
but I've never took her out once.

25:06.720 --> 25:09.240
Maybe you'll bang tonight.
Maybe.

25:09.320 --> 25:11.040
No, we're not gonna bang.

25:11.120 --> 25:13.720
I'm not gonna lie,
I am excited for this date.

25:13.800 --> 25:15.720
I just hope I don't get feelings.

25:15.800 --> 25:17.280
Let's hold hands.

25:18.080 --> 25:22.560
(laughter)

25:24.200 --> 25:26.360
I think I broke me leg.

25:26.440 --> 25:29.880
Chloe and Marty remind of those
naughty kids at the school disco

25:29.960 --> 25:32.480
who eat too many sweets
and have mum pick them up.

25:32.560 --> 25:34.080
They're fucking mad.

25:34.160 --> 25:36.600
I think Marty's gonna put it on,
you know?

25:36.680 --> 25:38.680
(all talk over each other)

25:38.760 --> 25:42.480
He sits here giving it all that.
Trust me, he's still smitten.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.480
Hello.
Hello, welcome.

25:48.560 --> 25:51.360
Oi, oi. I'm glad the Tablet
of Terror sent us on a date,

25:51.440 --> 25:54.280
cos we need a proper conversation
as to where we're at.

25:54.360 --> 25:57.800
Today we're gonna cook Balinese
traditional dishes.

25:57.880 --> 25:59.520
Bolognese?

25:59.600 --> 26:00.840
No, Balinese, man.

26:00.920 --> 26:05.040
Bolognese? Chloe, it's Balinese.
We're in Bali.

26:05.120 --> 26:06.200
She said Bolognese.

26:06.280 --> 26:09.440
She thought you said Bolognese.
Bah-lee-knees.

26:09.520 --> 26:11.560
Bah-lee-knees.

26:11.640 --> 26:13.800
So, do you cook together often?

26:13.880 --> 26:16.120
Yeah, we're seeing each other.
We're not.

26:16.200 --> 26:18.600
We're married with two kids.
We're not.

26:18.680 --> 26:21.320
It looks like a knob.
Looks like a willy.

26:21.400 --> 26:22.600
(both laugh)

26:22.680 --> 26:24.120
Looks like Martin's.

26:24.200 --> 26:27.160
The resemblance between
the pestle and Marty's chopper

26:27.240 --> 26:28.640
is making us horny.

26:31.440 --> 26:34.480
It's not. Mine and Chloe's
first date is weird.

26:34.560 --> 26:38.560
Feels mad going on a date when
you're trying to build a friendship.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.440
We had a laugh last night.
We did.

26:40.520 --> 26:43.280
That's the first time
a girl's made me laugh.

26:43.360 --> 26:44.840
All them girls are boring.

26:44.920 --> 26:47.440
I was nervous this morning,
cos we kissed.

26:47.520 --> 26:49.040
What if this ruins it?

26:49.120 --> 26:51.560
I don't understand why we do it.
It's weird.

26:54.800 --> 26:58.920
I have always had feelings for you,
but this is the time to get over you.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
Make sure you have that mindset
and don't cock block us.

27:02.080 --> 27:03.080
That's fine.

27:03.160 --> 27:05.640
I can't stop Marty
getting with anyone,

27:05.720 --> 27:08.200
just please, do not rub it
in front of my face.

27:08.280 --> 27:10.400
She says she's not bothered
if I neck on,

27:10.480 --> 27:13.520
but I hope she remembers
this when she's pissed later.

27:13.600 --> 27:16.240
I'm gonna be
respectful to you as well.

27:16.320 --> 27:19.120
For now, me and Marty
are gonna be friends

27:19.200 --> 27:22.120
and I'm really happy we've been
on our first ever date.

27:23.440 --> 27:26.480
What the fuck's that in my mouth?
A moth?

27:30.400 --> 27:31.760
(tablet buzzes)

27:31.840 --> 27:34.400
(all groan and cheer)

27:34.480 --> 27:36.960
Please be good news.

27:37.040 --> 27:39.040
"Nicole has left the villa."

27:40.520 --> 27:44.600
"But you still have something
to remember her by."

27:47.880 --> 27:49.480
Eh?

27:51.200 --> 27:52.960
What the fuck?

27:55.800 --> 27:58.240
Oh, my God, her ex.

27:58.320 --> 27:59.880
Fucking hell.

27:59.960 --> 28:01.200
Has to be the ex.

28:07.080 --> 28:10.520
(Spanish guitar music)

28:17.480 --> 28:19.440
Oh, geezer.

28:19.520 --> 28:22.120
Who's this? Why's he here?
To drop the paper off?

28:22.200 --> 28:23.360
You all right, yeah?

28:23.440 --> 28:27.240
Nicole, you've been crying since day
one about this? Fuck off.

28:27.320 --> 28:29.320
Hello, Brad, I'm Fati.

28:29.400 --> 28:30.920
(laughter)

28:31.000 --> 28:33.040
Sit next to me.

28:33.120 --> 28:34.680
I'm gonna bang him tonight.

28:34.760 --> 28:36.600
(laughter)

28:36.680 --> 28:38.160
I love the colour.

28:39.160 --> 28:41.600
Nicole's gonna fucking scream.

28:41.680 --> 28:44.160
Fatima, she's trying
to crack on with Brad.

28:44.240 --> 28:46.440
Pff. This girl is ruthless.

28:46.520 --> 28:49.360
My name's Brad, I'm from Birmingham,
I'm a carpenter.

28:49.440 --> 28:52.240
I've been boxing for few years
on and off.

28:52.320 --> 28:55.240
It's not the size of the dog,
it's the size of the fight.

28:55.320 --> 28:58.720
The relationship with Nicole got
toxic cos of stuff I done

28:58.800 --> 29:00.760
and then she'd go back tit-for-tat

29:00.840 --> 29:03.280
and we'd do anything
to piss each other off.

29:03.360 --> 29:06.240
When I go in the villa,
expect the unexpected.

29:07.240 --> 29:09.600
Where is Nicole?
She got chucked out, mate.

29:09.680 --> 29:11.800
Gone? What?

29:11.880 --> 29:14.200
Nicole's not here. What the fuck?

29:14.280 --> 29:17.320
Yeah.
Nicole literally lost her shit.

29:18.320 --> 29:21.120
This is the girl
Nicole went for last night.

29:21.200 --> 29:26.160
Knowing Nicole went cos of a fight,
I'm a bit confused at the minute.

29:26.240 --> 29:28.760
She's been crying
and stuff loads over you.

29:28.840 --> 29:31.120
She don't deal with things well,
to be fair.

29:31.200 --> 29:32.680
Did she cheat on your ever?

29:32.760 --> 29:35.040
She didn't cheat on me. I did.

29:35.120 --> 29:38.480
I took her kindness for a weakness,
ain't gonna lie.

29:38.560 --> 29:40.040
Brad seems like a prick.

29:40.120 --> 29:44.320
I'll be honest, geezer,
Nicole was fucked up by you.

29:44.400 --> 29:46.120
Proper head fuck.
I understand.

29:46.200 --> 29:50.520
She was a sweet girl and as soon
as your name come up, she switched.

29:50.600 --> 29:52.440
It was me that sent her that way.

29:52.520 --> 29:54.960
When love's involved,
it's a different story.

29:55.040 --> 29:59.320
I think Brad's all right.
He's owned up to the way he was.

29:59.400 --> 30:00.440
I respect that.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.560
You want me to show you round?

30:03.640 --> 30:05.600
Fatima's fanny is pulsing.

30:05.680 --> 30:11.120
She's never met him, but she's been
wanting to sit on him since day one.

30:11.200 --> 30:13.840
Are you coming as well?
Show me around.

30:13.920 --> 30:17.360
Calm down, Brad, no need to be
scared. You don't need a friend.

30:17.440 --> 30:19.280
A free shag, don't turn it down.

30:19.360 --> 30:22.320
Nah, listen, that ain't happening.

30:22.400 --> 30:26.480
This is hilarious. He may be
a dwarf, but he can throw a pie.

30:27.520 --> 30:32.320
People telling Brad I wanna
fuck him. It's ruined my plan.

30:32.400 --> 30:35.760
I'll look, but it's not happening.
This bird is loose.

30:35.840 --> 30:36.880
That's quite rude.

30:36.960 --> 30:41.080
She was into him cos she's a psycho.
I see nothing attractive.

30:41.160 --> 30:42.800
Someone else show him.

30:42.880 --> 30:45.680
Let me show you around.
Fucking hell, Fati, man.

30:45.760 --> 30:48.040
I'm not gonna sleep with you,
you div.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.480
Oi, oi!

30:58.560 --> 31:00.440
(all cheer)

31:00.520 --> 31:01.600
How was your date?

31:01.680 --> 31:04.680
Yeah, it was good.
Didn't get up to any mischief?

31:04.760 --> 31:06.800
No, never.

31:06.880 --> 31:09.720
You fucking necked last night.
(laughter)

31:09.800 --> 31:14.600
We had to bring that up, but I don't
think it's gonna happen again.

31:14.680 --> 31:17.120
Marty doesn't seem to
give a shit about Chloe.

31:17.200 --> 31:20.800
Hopefully she's ready to move on.
No more kissing. It's dodgy.

31:20.880 --> 31:22.440
(laughs) Until you get drunk.

31:22.520 --> 31:24.360
Mate, nah, fuck that, man.

31:24.440 --> 31:27.400
Hold on a minute,
who the fuck is this new lad?

31:27.480 --> 31:30.800
Nicole's ex.
Nicole? She's not even here.

31:30.880 --> 31:32.600
What's your name?
Brad.

31:32.680 --> 31:36.080
Brad's come into this villa
and his ex's already gone home.

31:36.160 --> 31:38.000
The lucky little fuck.

31:38.080 --> 31:39.840
Do you fancy this boy?

31:39.920 --> 31:44.520
I think he's a nice guy, but...
Are you gonna shag him or not?

31:44.600 --> 31:46.480
May as well, man.

31:46.560 --> 31:47.840
I would, I'm horny.

31:47.920 --> 31:50.880
Get your knickers off.
Kid, get your boxers off.

31:50.960 --> 31:52.800
If I was you, I'd stay away.

31:52.880 --> 31:55.240
Why, though?
He's a fucking wrong 'un.

31:56.400 --> 31:57.480
What?

31:57.560 --> 31:58.920
I think you're a snake.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.120
I think you're a snake.

32:01.200 --> 32:04.880
Nicole's my mate and she's told me
a lot of stuff this kid's done.

32:04.960 --> 32:06.640
I'm not gonna have it.

32:06.720 --> 32:08.360
You haven't heard his story.

32:08.440 --> 32:11.720
Jordan hasn't had so much as a kiss
since he walked in.

32:11.800 --> 32:13.720
I understand your frustration,

32:13.800 --> 32:16.560
but no need to start on someone
as soon as they walk in.

32:16.640 --> 32:20.520
To be fair, he's come in, admitted he
was a dickhead, a prick. Fair enough.

32:20.600 --> 32:22.440
He don't even know me from Adam.

32:22.520 --> 32:24.560
He's had all day to speak to me.

32:24.640 --> 32:25.760
He's a fucking prick.

32:25.840 --> 32:27.680
Have a chat, tell me your side.

32:27.760 --> 32:30.760
Come and have a chat then.
Go and have a chat.

32:30.840 --> 32:33.520
Yeah, chat properly,
cos yous two have got issues.

32:33.600 --> 32:34.800
You're a twat, mate.

32:34.880 --> 32:38.240
He's heard what Nicole's had to say,
he can have an opinion,

32:38.320 --> 32:42.040
but when he tries to slag me off,
I ain't having it.

32:42.120 --> 32:45.560
Who are you to get involved?
Cos she's my mate.

32:45.640 --> 32:47.680
This geezer is a fucking knob end.

32:47.760 --> 32:50.280
I sat down with the bird
and chatted with her

32:50.360 --> 32:53.640
and found out the sort of cunt
you're really like.

32:53.720 --> 32:56.880
Who the fuck are you talking to?
Geezer, you're four foot.

32:58.800 --> 33:00.960
This runt is trying
to square up to me.

33:01.040 --> 33:03.000
He needs a ladder
to give me a blowjob.

33:03.080 --> 33:05.600
I tell you what,
stick your feet in fertiliser,

33:05.680 --> 33:08.080
when you grow, talk to me then.

33:08.160 --> 33:10.000
Listen, do not fuck with me.

33:10.080 --> 33:13.440
You wouldn't be able to reach
my chin, you peasant. Come on.

33:13.520 --> 33:17.600
Come on, step up.
Oh, my days, what a prat.

33:19.120 --> 33:21.440
You just flinched
from a kid who's four foot.

33:21.520 --> 33:23.800
It's not flinching,
it's quick reaction.

33:23.880 --> 33:26.960
Jordan's a big I am. Kid's a prick.
I'm done with him.

33:27.040 --> 33:30.440
I dunno what Brad's still doing
here, it's past his bed time.

33:33.360 --> 33:35.320
Do you know, Nicole would be annoyed.

33:35.400 --> 33:37.080
No, she fucking wouldn't.

33:37.160 --> 33:38.400
Jordan's a freak.

33:38.480 --> 33:39.480
I guarantee you.

33:39.560 --> 33:41.640
She speaks to the girls
more than you.

33:41.720 --> 33:44.160
Che starts piping up for no reason.

33:44.240 --> 33:46.640
She can shut up
or I'm gonna put her right in it.

33:46.720 --> 33:48.920
Are you two pally then?
Are you two mates?

33:49.000 --> 33:51.440
Why would us two not be mates?
(laughs)

33:51.520 --> 33:56.360
Would you let a fella who's cracking
on with a mate get in bed with you?

33:56.440 --> 33:58.880
I can't believe he said that.

33:58.960 --> 34:00.760
What is it, Pick On Dean Day?

34:00.840 --> 34:03.880
Jordan has thrown me under the bus,
I look like a dirty dog.

34:03.960 --> 34:08.480
Dean got out of your bed,
sat in my bed and got told to leave.

34:08.560 --> 34:11.880
'And it happened
just like this, Savannah.'

34:23.040 --> 34:26.600
I thought Dean was such a nice guy.
What a fucking prick.

34:26.679 --> 34:29.320
How does that make you feel?
She your best mate?

34:29.400 --> 34:33.560
If Che didn't poke her nose in,
none of this would have happened.

34:33.639 --> 34:36.520
I trust you, babe.
Yeah, exactly. Shut up.

34:36.600 --> 34:40.159
You call him a snake, look
at the state of you, you idiot.

34:40.239 --> 34:44.080
Che is my mate and I know
if he'd have tried it on,

34:44.159 --> 34:47.239
that she'd have told me,
so I'm not angry at her.

34:49.360 --> 34:52.800
'Surely you're not gonna
let Dean off the hook that easy?'

34:52.880 --> 34:56.960
Why would you crawl out of bed
and get into bed with her anyway?

34:57.040 --> 35:00.640
I asked you for a cuddle, you said
it's too hot and you went to sleep.

35:00.720 --> 35:02.200
I went and gave her a cuddle.

35:02.280 --> 35:04.640
Doesn't mean you jump in bed
with my mate.

35:04.720 --> 35:08.200
The one thing I don't deal
with is people who think I'm a mug.

35:08.280 --> 35:10.600
Fuck off.
Would you have kissed her?

35:10.680 --> 35:13.200
Yeah, course I woulda.
Che is a bit of a sort.

35:13.280 --> 35:16.400
100% I'd bang her.
Why'd you do that?Getting nowhere.

35:16.480 --> 35:19.520
You were getting nowhere?
She's fucking boring.

35:19.600 --> 35:22.800
I know no-one in this villa
thinks I'm boring.

35:22.880 --> 35:25.480
I think Jordan's just being
a shit stirrer.

35:25.560 --> 35:28.360
Who the fuck
are you calling boring?!

35:28.440 --> 35:32.240
You are boring. You sit around
the pool with a resting bitch face.

35:32.320 --> 35:35.800
Don't be fucking getting like that.
Come on, get in the net.

35:35.880 --> 35:38.240
All of a sudden
all the girls are boring

35:38.320 --> 35:41.040
just cos they don't wanna shag you.

35:41.120 --> 35:43.160
Didn't realise
she's got a back bone.

35:43.240 --> 35:45.360
I got a massive bite.
Fuck off!

35:45.440 --> 35:47.720
It's getting away!
She's getting away!

35:47.800 --> 35:51.120
Jordan, stop it! (laughs)

35:51.200 --> 35:53.040
'Jordan's starting fights,

35:53.120 --> 35:56.720
but who will be on the defensive
when the next ex arrives?'

35:56.800 --> 35:59.560
(evil laugh)

36:06.120 --> 36:07.680
Drinking games!

36:07.760 --> 36:09.840
Would you rather?
I've got one!

36:09.920 --> 36:12.480
This will be intriguing.
Savannah, come here.

36:12.560 --> 36:14.440
Who do you wanna get with,
me or Dean?

36:14.520 --> 36:18.160
Obviously you, cos Dean's been a
prick getting into bed with Che.

36:18.240 --> 36:19.760
So, fuck off.

36:19.840 --> 36:21.160
Kiss him then.

36:21.240 --> 36:24.280
I'm not saying I'm gonna do it.
Cos you're fucking boring!

36:24.360 --> 36:25.400
Dean is a prick.

36:25.480 --> 36:28.880
Marty's really fit. He's sexy.
I'm gonna have to kiss him.

36:28.960 --> 36:31.400
Give it a bit of tongue.
(laughter)

36:33.520 --> 36:35.440
Marty said he'd give us respect.

36:35.520 --> 36:38.200
and he is necking on with Savanna
in front of me.

36:38.280 --> 36:40.240
Go on.
Peer pressure.

36:40.320 --> 36:43.040
Oh, dear.
(indistinct)

36:44.520 --> 36:47.880
Wait there, boy, you weren't
saying that on the date.

36:47.960 --> 36:49.640
He's trying to act cool,

36:49.720 --> 36:52.320
but you slagged them off
saying they were boring.

36:52.400 --> 36:55.440
We were on a date saying
all the girls were boring.

36:55.520 --> 37:00.200
He's sat necking on with Savannah,
he's the most two-faced person ever.

37:00.280 --> 37:02.680
Who would you rather shag,
Savannah or Chloe?

37:02.760 --> 37:06.240
It's obvious. He's not shagged her.
Fucking obvious.

37:06.320 --> 37:09.640
I'm sick of her
being a cock blocker.

37:09.720 --> 37:11.400
I'd shag Savannah over Chloe.

37:11.480 --> 37:15.680
Oh, yeah?
I'd rather shag her over you.

37:15.760 --> 37:17.200
I don't give a fuck.

37:17.280 --> 37:21.960
This goes to show Marty
has no respect for me whatsoever.

37:22.040 --> 37:24.040
Are you taking the piss?

37:24.120 --> 37:28.120
'Looks like Chloe might be about to
play Marty at his own game.

37:28.200 --> 37:30.280
Do you fancy us?

37:31.240 --> 37:33.240
What is it you fancy about us?

37:37.320 --> 37:41.040
Chloe has got a great arse
and a great set of boobs.

37:42.280 --> 37:43.960
My head is all over the place.

37:44.040 --> 37:46.960
But Jordan is the perfect person
to make Marty jealous.

37:47.040 --> 37:49.800
I'm gonna try so hard tonight
to make this work.

37:51.840 --> 37:54.080
Definitely up for it.

37:54.160 --> 37:56.080
I'm not bothered about Marty.

37:56.160 --> 37:58.840
Straight in bed with Jordan.
She tried to kiss me.

38:04.880 --> 38:08.120
The bird's a slag.
(laughter)

38:10.480 --> 38:13.720
Fair enough I pissed off Chloe
by necking on with Savannah.

38:13.800 --> 38:15.680
She's necking on with Jordan.

38:15.760 --> 38:17.960
It's gonna get interesting.

38:18.040 --> 38:19.560
Mate...

38:19.640 --> 38:21.240
Fun and games. It's funny.

38:21.320 --> 38:24.080
Let's not ruin it.
Let's stick to flirting.

38:24.160 --> 38:25.520
One step at a time.

38:25.600 --> 38:28.760
Yeah. Me and Jordan
had a little peck.

38:28.840 --> 38:32.640
I wanna take baby steps, cos women
don't neck on on the first date.

38:32.720 --> 38:36.480
I'm gonna eat some sandwiches.
See you in the morning.
