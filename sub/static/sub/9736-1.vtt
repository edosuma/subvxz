will not be like other auditions.

29:50.860 --> 29:55.012

people who can work together.

I’m going to try to shake you up,
see who you really are.

30:01.260 --> 30:07.779
We’ve got some small but important
parts for people in the chorus.

30:07.980 --> 30:13.100
I need great dancers, so I can’t
expect you all to be great actors.

30:13.300 --> 30:20.297
So I don’t want anybody
to try to act. Understand?

30:20.500 --> 30:26.530
Just be who you are. That’s just
as important as how you dance.

30:26.740 --> 30:33.179
I’m going to ask you some questions.
I want to know details about you.

30:33.380 --> 30:37.612
Things you’re proud of,
things you’re ashamed of.

30:37.820 --> 30:41.972
If anybody can’t handle it
and wants to leave, -

30:42.180 --> 30:45.058
- now is the time.

31:01.740 --> 31:05.813

We’re going to be fine.

31:12.300 --> 31:18.216
<i>We’re Puerto Ricans. To them,
we’re ashamed of everything.</i>

31:21.540 --> 31:26.455
If I could think of anything I’d be
ashamed of, I’d have tried it.

31:26.660 --> 31:31.051
Look, Zach...
I just need a minute.

31:37.180 --> 31:40.217
- How many jobs are there?
- Four and four.

31:40.420 --> 31:43.014
44?

31:43.220 --> 31:47.133
- Four boys, four girls.
- Any women?

31:54.100 --> 31:58.013
Dick,
I’m going to need a spotlight.

32:01.060 --> 32:04.939
Zach said he'll call you
as soon as he can.

32:05.140 --> 32:09.895
And he told me to ask you
in a nice way...

32:12.100 --> 32:15.172
...would you mind leaving?

32:26.860 --> 32:29.055
Shit!

32:31.820 --> 32:34.812
- Taxi!
- Cassie!

32:39.380 --> 32:41.735
Are you all right?

32:41.940 --> 32:45.410
- Are you okay?
- I’m fine.

32:56.020 --> 33:01.811
- Okay, Michael. You start.
- Me? Why not start at the end?

33:02.020 --> 33:06.059
- What would you like to tell me?
- To start at the end.

33:06.260 --> 33:12.051
- Wait in the musicians" room.
- He told me to leave.

33:12.260 --> 33:16.412
- Shut up. Are you all right?
- Fine.

33:16.620 --> 33:20.295
- I"II get some ice for your elbow.
- I feel terrible.

33:20.500 --> 33:26.132
- What made you start dancing?
- My sister. She was a girl.

33:26.340 --> 33:31.972
So she got all the dancing lessons.
Once in a while she took me along.

33:32.180 --> 33:36.332
- How old were you?
- Four. I’d sit there and...

33:36.540 --> 33:39.213
<i>I’m watching sis go pitapat</i>

33:39.420 --> 33:43.857
<i>I said, "I can do that"
"I can do that"</i>

33:44.060 --> 33:47.211
<i>Knew every step right off the bat</i>

33:47.420 --> 33:51.936
<i>I can do that
I can do that</i>

33:52.140 --> 33:56.019
<i>One morning sis won’t go
to dance class</i>

33:56.220 --> 34:00.133
<i>I grabbed her shoes, tights and all
but my foot’s too small</i>

34:00.340 --> 34:03.298
<i>I stuffed her shoes
with extra socks</i>

34:03.500 --> 34:07.209
<i>Ran seven blocks in nothing flat</i>

34:07.420 --> 34:11.572
<i>I can do that
That I can do</i>

34:14.219 --> 34:16.415
Give me some room!

35:58.660 --> 36:03.814
<i>All thanks to sis,
I can do that.</i>

36:12.260 --> 36:15.855
Have you got any ice
for my ego?

36:16.060 --> 36:19.291
You know what Zach’s like
when he’s working...

36:19.500 --> 36:23.493
What are you talking to me
like I’m a grown-up for?

36:23.700 --> 36:28.330
Just stay put,
and keep that ice on your elbow.

36:28.540 --> 36:33.011
- Does Zach still think I...
- Let’s get one thing straight.

36:33.220 --> 36:39.136
You can stay with me, but I’m not
getting between you and Zach.

36:48.140 --> 36:51.098
I don’t know how I turned out
this heavenly.

36:51.300 --> 36:55.532
- Are you going to do a routine?
- No, moving right along.

36:55.740 --> 36:58.618
Start with your family.

36:58.820 --> 37:03.177
Do you want to know the wonderful
things, or do you want the truth?

37:03.380 --> 37:06.531
I"II take the truth.

37:06.740 --> 37:13.054
My mother was one of the foremost
bridge cheaters in America.

37:13.260 --> 37:19.017
My father worked for a big
corporation. He was away a lot...

37:19.220 --> 37:22.769
...to drink.
But they were okay.

37:22.980 --> 37:26.450
- I was the strange one.
- How strange?

37:26.660 --> 37:29.891
Real, real strange.

37:31.420 --> 37:34.218
Bizarre.

37:34.420 --> 37:38.493
As I got older,
I got stranger and stranger.

37:38.700 --> 37:41.055
I started breaking in.

37:41.260 --> 37:44.491
I didn’t steal anything,
I just rearranged.

37:45.740 --> 37:51.929
I went to an expensive private
school for the exceptionally stupid.

37:52.140 --> 37:56.850
Jock City. I always got slammed
into lockers.

37:57.060 --> 38:01.099
Not only by the students,
by the teachers, too.

38:01.300 --> 38:07.216
I couldn’t catch a ball. And my father
was a big ex-football hero.

38:07.420 --> 38:13.939
He was so humiliated
that he told his friends I had polio.

38:14.140 --> 38:18.611
On Father’s Day
I used to limp for him.

38:18.820 --> 38:24.258
And I was always thinking up
spectacular ways of killing myself.

38:24.460 --> 38:29.659
But I realized, to commit suicide
in Buffalo is redundant.

38:29.860 --> 38:35.492
- Exactly what you don’t want, right?
- Exactly.

38:35.700 --> 38:37.179
Dick! Give me the spotlight.

38:42.300 --> 38:45.815
To the left. A little more. Hold it.

38:46.020 --> 38:48.011
Sheila.

38:50.380 --> 38:52.894
Is there anything you want to tell me?

38:53.100 --> 38:57.378
What do I want to be
when I grow up?

38:57.580 --> 39:02.734
Young.
Don’t you have any softer light?

39:02.940 --> 39:06.012
Come closer.

39:06.220 --> 39:11.214
- Can I sit on your lap?
- Do you always come on like this?

39:11.420 --> 39:15.459
No. Sometimes I’m aggressive.

39:15.660 --> 39:20.973
- Tell me about your parents.
- My parents?

39:21.180 --> 39:24.217
About your mother.

39:24.420 --> 39:28.538
My poor, sweet, darling old mother.

39:28.740 --> 39:32.858
She was raised in an orphanage.
They wouldn’t let her go out...

39:33.060 --> 39:37.690
God damn it! Can’t anybody up there
hear me? Just let your hair down!

39:37.900 --> 39:43.179
Can’t you talk? Just talk!
To me, to each other.

39:43.380 --> 39:45.814
Jesus Christ!

39:49.300 --> 39:52.929
Better?

39:53.140 --> 39:55.973
Your mother...

39:56.180 --> 40:01.459
- She was middle-aged and frumpy.
- Whose isn’t?

40:01.660 --> 40:04.732
She was at fourteen.

40:04.940 --> 40:09.456
Is that the kind of woman
your father liked?

40:09.660 --> 40:15.098
He liked them young, tall,
and filled out in the right places.

40:15.300 --> 40:21.978
Anyway... God knows why,
they had this daughter: Me.

40:22.180 --> 40:28.016
To get away from her frumpy life,
she took me to every ballet.

40:28.220 --> 40:31.974
Probably because it was cheaper
than a baby-sitter.

40:32.180 --> 40:36.093
That’s when I saw that movie.
"The Red Shoes".

40:36.300 --> 40:41.169
- It changed my whole life.
- I saw it 112 times.

40:41.380 --> 40:44.178
I swear.

40:44.380 --> 40:48.817
- Go on, Sheila.
- Let’s face it.

40:49.020 --> 40:53.491
My family scene was not good.

40:53.700 --> 40:58.410
<i>Daddy thought he married
beneath him, that’s what he said</i>

40:58.620 --> 41:04.092
<i>When proposing he told my mother
he was probably her last chance</i>

41:04.300 --> 41:09.169
<i>Though she was 22</i>

41:09.380 --> 41:13.134
<i>Though she was 22</i>

41:14.340 --> 41:18.128
<i>She married him</i>

41:18.340 --> 41:22.811
<i>Life with my dad wasn’t a picnic,
more like a come-as-you-are</i>

41:23.020 --> 41:27.536
<i>When I was five I remember
Mother dug earrings out of the car</i>

41:27.740 --> 41:33.098
<i>They weren’t hers
but it wasn’t discussed</i>

41:33.300 --> 41:36.098
<i>He wasn’t warm</i>

41:36.300 --> 41:38.939
<i>Not to her</i>

41:39.140 --> 41:42.132
<i>Not to us</i>

41:43.580 --> 41:50.497
<i>But everything was beautiful
at the ballet</i>

41:50.700 --> 41:56.411
<i>GracefuI men litf
lovely girls in white</i>

41:56.620 --> 42:03.173
<i>Yes, everything was beautiful
at the ballet</i>

42:04.540 --> 42:10.536
<i>I was happy at the ballet</i>

42:10.740 --> 42:13.015
That’s when I started ballet class.

42:13.220 --> 42:19.819
<i>Up a steep and very narrow stairway
to the voice like a metronome</i>

42:20.020 --> 42:23.171
<i>Up a steep and narrow stairway</i>

42:23.380 --> 42:26.816
<i>It wasn’t paradise</i>

42:27.020 --> 42:32.697
<i>No, it wasn’t paradise
but it was home</i>

42:32.900 --> 42:37.690
<i>Mother said I’d be attractive
when I grew up</i>

42:37.900 --> 42:40.653
<i>"Different," she said,
"with a special something"</i>

42:40.860 --> 42:44.011
<i>"And a very personal flair"</i>

42:44.220 --> 42:51.217
<i>And though I was eight or nine
though I was eight or nine</i>

42:52.860 --> 42:56.535
<i>I hated her</i>

42:56.740 --> 43:01.450
<i>Different is nice, but not pretty,
pretty is what it’s about</i>

43:01.660 --> 43:06.131
<i>Everyone I met who was different
could figure that out</i>

43:06.340 --> 43:11.812
<i>So beautiful
I’d never live to see</i>

43:12.020 --> 43:14.454
<i>But it was clear</i>

43:14.660 --> 43:17.333
<i>If not to her</i>

43:17.540 --> 43:19.929
<i>then to me</i>

43:20.140 --> 43:27.091
<i>That everyone is beautiful
at the ballet</i>

43:27.300 --> 43:33.250
<i>Every prince
has got to have his swan</i>

43:33.460 --> 43:40.775
<i>Yes, everyone is beautiful
at the ballet</i>

43:40.980 --> 43:46.657
<i>I was pretty at the ballet.</i>

43:49.180 --> 43:52.809
I was born to save their marriage.

43:53.020 --> 43:57.059
But when my father
came to the hospital, -

43:57.260 --> 44:02.254
- he said, "I thought this was going
to help, but I guess not. "

44:02.460 --> 44:07.250
A few months later he left
and never came back.

44:07.460 --> 44:14.855
I had this incredible fantasy life.
I danced around like this...

44:16.460 --> 44:19.896
In my fantasy there was
this Indian chief.

44:20.100 --> 44:25.936
He’d say to me,
"Maggie, do you want to dance?"

44:26.140 --> 44:31.976
And I’d say,
"Daddy, I would love to dance. "

44:32.180 --> 44:38.528
<i>Yes, everything was beautiful
at the ballet</i>

44:38.740 --> 44:44.531
<i>Raise your arms
and someone’s always there</i>

44:44.740 --> 44:51.134
<i>Yes, everything was beautiful
at the ballet</i>

44:51.340 --> 44:54.298
<i>The ballet</i>

44:54.500 --> 44:57.731
<i>The ballet</i>

45:10.140 --> 45:17.171
<i>Yes, everything was beautiful
at the ballet</i>

45:17.380 --> 45:19.655
<i>I was pretty</i>

45:19.860 --> 45:22.010
<i>I was happy</i>

45:22.220 --> 45:24.370
<i>I would love to</i>

45:24.580 --> 45:31.930
<i>At the ballet.</i>

45:46.700 --> 45:50.898
Give me the resumé
of the blonde in the two-piece.

45:51.100 --> 45:53.819
Bebe Benson.

46:01.860 --> 46:06.536
Can we smoke?
Can the adults please smoke?

46:06.740 --> 46:11.177
- No breaks, Sheila.
- Can I discuss that with my kidneys?

46:12.260 --> 46:15.775
- Fine.
- Thank you.

46:18.820 --> 46:21.778
- Kristine.
- Me?

46:25.780 --> 46:31.252
- I don’t know where to begin.
- Tell him how you started dancing.

46:31.460 --> 46:37.649
Well, it was when this man
came around to my home selling...

46:37.860 --> 46:40.328
- Lessons.
- Yeah...

46:40.540 --> 46:44.977
Dancing lessons.
And ever since then -

46:45.180 --> 46:51.415
- I watched everything on TV that
had dancing on it. Especially...

46:51.620 --> 46:55.818
Oh, God, what do you call "em?

46:56.020 --> 46:59.899
Variety shows.

47:02.700 --> 47:06.329
- What was I talking about?
- Specials.

47:06.540 --> 47:12.456
- No, I wasn’t... it was...
- Specials.

47:14.060 --> 47:17.689
Right, specials. Oh, God.

47:17.900 --> 47:20.937
I’m sorry, I’m really nervous.

47:21.140 --> 47:28.694
<i>- Pull yourself together.
- Zach? This is together.</i>

47:30.180 --> 47:34.332
Robbie, there’s a suitcase
over there somewhere.

47:34.540 --> 47:39.011
Sheila, get your ass
up on the stage.

47:39.220 --> 47:43.099
Why is it only my ass
that gets invited?

47:45.780 --> 47:50.695
Costumes are in there.
Hats should be in this one.

47:53.620 --> 47:59.252
Go to the prop room on the third
floor and stay out of sight.

47:59.460 --> 48:05.490
I know I’m putting you in a spot,
but I really need a job.

48:05.700 --> 48:11.013
I"II talk to Zach, but you’ve got to
stay put. No more interruptions.

48:11.220 --> 48:16.658
- Promise? Say "I promise".
- Promise.

48:20.180 --> 48:26.938
I’m straight. I’m not too bright,
but I’m not too dumb.

48:27.140 --> 48:30.689
And I’m not too talented.

48:30.900 --> 48:37.851
But you show me what to do,
I"II do it eight shows a week.

48:40.940 --> 48:45.650
Can I go next? I don’t really have
anything to say, -

48:45.860 --> 48:48.818
- but the waiting is killing me.

48:51.100 --> 48:55.651
Okay...
Start with your childhood.

48:55.860 --> 49:00.729
- Terrible, like everybody else’s.
- All of it?

49:00.940 --> 49:05.570
None of it, but who wants to admit
to a happy childhood?

49:07.380 --> 49:10.611
- How about sex?
- Sex?

49:10.820 --> 49:14.733
Oh, sex!
Now that was really terrible.

49:14.940 --> 49:17.408
How?

49:17.620 --> 49:22.978
I was twelve years old
and I didn’t know much about it.

49:23.180 --> 49:28.652
So I took out this book with pictures
of the male and female anatomy.

49:28.860 --> 49:33.695
I thought it was pretty interesting.
I read that book a lot.

49:33.900 --> 49:38.212
Were you interested in medicine?
Or were you just into the pictures?

49:38.420 --> 49:42.015
<i>- Hello, twelve
- Hello, thirteen</i>

49:42.220 --> 49:44.859
<i>Hello, love</i>

49:45.060 --> 49:51.693
After my first wet dream,
I looked it up in the medical book.

49:51.900 --> 49:55.939
"Milky discharge... "
Oh, my God! Gonorrhea!

49:56.140 --> 49:59.655
<i>- Changes all
- Down below</i>

49:59.860 --> 50:03.535
<i>Up above</i>

50:03.740 --> 50:09.372
I was in shock.
I didn’t have anybody to talk to.

50:09.580 --> 50:16.531
So I told the priest I had
gonorrhea. Was he in shock!

50:16.740 --> 50:20.938
<i>Who have you been with, my son</i>

50:21.140 --> 50:24.496
Nobody

50:24.700 --> 50:29.774
<i>Then how can you have gonorrhea?</i>

50:29.980 --> 50:35.850
Finally I told him about the book,
and he set me straight.

50:36.060 --> 50:39.689
It’s the only time
the church ever helped me.

50:39.900 --> 50:42.812
<i>- Time to doubt
- To break out</i>

50:43.020 --> 50:46.251
<i>It’s a mess</i>

50:46.460 --> 50:51.170
Sex is the only subject I can speak of
without any authority whatsoever.

50:51.380 --> 50:54.611
<i>Too young to take over</i>

50:54.820 --> 50:57.778
<i>Too old to ignore</i>

50:57.980 --> 51:01.211
Finally I got a girl
who was willing.

51:01.420 --> 51:05.971
There I am, making out in the
backseat with Sally Ketchum.

51:06.180 --> 51:12.016
A little of this, a little of that...
Very little of that.

51:12.220 --> 51:17.374
After about an hour she said,
"Don’t you want to do anything else?"

51:17.580 --> 51:22.938
I suddenly thought to myself,
"No, I don’t. "

51:23.140 --> 51:26.212
Did this come as a big surprise?

51:26.420 --> 51:33.531
I guess. It was the moment
I realized I was gay.

51:33.780 --> 51:35.338
<i>Hello, twelve</i>

51:35.540 --> 51:38.134
<i>Hello, thirteen</i>

51:38.340 --> 51:41.218
<i>Hello, love</i>

51:44.220 --> 51:47.530
My first time was with a girl
called Paulette.

51:47.740 --> 51:50.413
We did it in a graveyard.

51:50.620 --> 51:56.092
<i>First time we made love
it was a great deal</i>

51:56.300 --> 52:02.614
<i>I was too scared to feel,
nervous from trying</i>

52:03.980 --> 52:09.771
<i>Next time we made love
still we were not a hit</i>

52:09.980 --> 52:15.771
<i>I thought, if this is it
everyone’s Lying</i>

52:15.980 --> 52:19.370
<i>Then we did it again</i>

52:19.580 --> 52:22.936
<i>And I forgot to be scared</i>

52:23.140 --> 52:30.535
<i>"Cause when we did it again"
I closed my eyes</i>

52:30.740 --> 52:34.096
<i>Surprise</i>

52:34.300 --> 52:37.497
<i>Surprise</i>

52:58.260 --> 53:04.096
<i>Sweet, icicle hot,
sweet as a lemon pie</i>

53:04.300 --> 53:09.852
<i>Sailing across the sky,
into the ocean</i>

53:11.980 --> 53:17.691
<i>We liked it a lot
you can imagine why</i>

53:17.900 --> 53:24.089
<i>We had begun to fly,
feelings in motion</i>

53:24.300 --> 53:27.451
<i>And then we did it again</i>

53:27.660 --> 53:30.777
<i>Was it beginner’s luck?</i>

53:30.980 --> 53:38.170
<i>Or is it wonderful
once in each three tries?</i>

53:39.620 --> 53:44.091
<i>Surprise</i>

55:20.700 --> 55:23.976
<i>First time</i>

55:26.580 --> 55:30.539
<i>Love</i>

55:30.740 --> 55:33.379
<i>Again</i>

55:33.580 --> 55:39.974
<i>So I closed my eyes.</i>

57:55.980 --> 57:59.370
Would you like to stay
twelve years old all your life?

57:59.580 --> 58:04.051
My last show, I played a 23-year-old.
I was 23.

58:04.260 --> 58:07.855
- The Year of the Chicken?
- Cut...

58:08.060 --> 58:11.496
Didn’t you go to the
School of Performing Arts?

58:11.700 --> 58:16.376
- I thought you looked familiar.
- Remember our acting teacher?

58:16.580 --> 58:21.449
"In order to be a real actor,
it’s not enough to act like a king. "

58:21.660 --> 58:24.652
"You also got to act like a throne. "

58:24.860 --> 58:27.658
Tell me about it, Morales.

58:27.860 --> 58:33.890
On the first day, Mr. Karp put us
with our legs around each other.

58:34.140 --> 58:37.735
Then he says, "Now improvise. "

58:37.940 --> 58:41.899
"You’re on a bobsled.
It’s snowing. "

58:42.100 --> 58:45.410
"And it’s cold. Go. "

58:45.620 --> 58:50.136
<i>Every day for a week
we tried to feel the motion</i>

58:50.340 --> 58:54.970
<i>Feel the motion down the hill</i>

58:55.180 --> 58:59.810
<i>Every day for a week
we tried to hear the wind</i>

59:00.020 --> 59:04.536
<i>Hear the wind rush, feel the chill</i>

59:04.740 --> 59:09.370
<i>I dug to the bottom of my soul
to see what I had inside</i>

59:09.580 --> 59:12.458
<i>Yes, I dug down to my soul</i>

59:12.660 --> 59:16.699
<i>And I tried</i>

59:16.900 --> 59:22.293
Everybody’s going, "Whoosh!
I feel the snow, I feel the cold. "

59:22.500 --> 59:25.731
"I feel the air. "
Mr. Karp says to me:

59:25.940 --> 59:30.650
"What did you feel, Morales?"
And I said:

59:30.860 --> 59:34.136
<i>Nothing, I’m feeling nothing</i>

59:34.340 --> 59:39.095
<i>He said, "Nothing
could get a girl transferred"</i>

59:39.300 --> 59:43.851
<i>They all felt something,
but I felt nothing</i>

59:44.060 --> 59:48.451
<i>Except feeling that this bullshit
was absurd.</i>

59:48.660 --> 59:52.494
I thought, "Don’t worry,
it’s only the first week. "

59:52.700 --> 59:56.613
"Maybe it’s genetic. "
They don’t have sleds in San Juan.

59:56.820 --> 01:00:03.612
<i>Second week we had to be
a table, be a sports car</i>

01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:06.175
<i>icecream cone</i>

01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:10.817
<i>Mr. Karp said,
"Very good, except Morales"</i>

01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:15.571
<i>"Try, Morales, all alone"</i>

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:20.490
<i>So I dug down into my soul
to see how an icecream felt</i>

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:27.219
<i>I dug down to the bottom of my soul
and I tried to melt</i>

01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:32.016
<i>And the kids yelled "Nothing"
they called me "nothing"</i>

01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:37.010
<i>And Karp allowed it,
which really made me burn</i>

01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:41.771
<i>They were so helpful
they called me hopeless</i>

01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:46.531
<i>Until I didn’t know
where else to turn</i>

01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:51.291
Mr. Karp comes up to me and says,
"You know what?"

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:54.139
"Try the Girls" High. "

01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:57.218
"You'll never be an actress. "

01:00:57.420 --> 01:01:00.378
Jesus Christ.

01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:08.009
<i>Went to church, praying,
"Santa Maria, send me guidance"</i>

01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:10.495
<i>On my knees</i>

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:17.458
<i>I was praying, "Santa Maria,
help me feel it, help me feel it"</i>

01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:20.174
<i>"Pretty please"</i>

01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:24.658
<i>A voice came from the bottom
of my soul to the top of my head</i>

01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:27.738
<i>A voice came from the bottom
of my soul</i>

01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:31.455
<i>Here is what it said</i>

01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:36.290
<i>"This man is nothing,
this course is nothing"</i>

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:41.051
<i>"If you want something,
go find a better class"</i>

01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:46.095
<i>"And when you find one
you'll be an actress"</i>

01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:52.535
<i>And I assure you
that’s what came to pass</i>

01:01:55.340 --> 01:02:01.415
<i>Six months later I heard
that Karp had died</i>

01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:06.933
<i>So I dug way down
to the bottom of my soul</i>

01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:12.134
<i>And cried</i>

01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:22.733
<i>"Cause I felt... nothing.</i>

01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:38.338
Okay, Don.

01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:43.455
I’ve been listening to these people,
but let’s be honest, -

01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:47.494
- here today, gone tomorrow.

01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:50.260
Take this married couple...

01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:54.658
Every time I tell my wife
I’m going to audition...

01:02:54.860 --> 01:02:58.375
She’s got a right to... you know...

01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:04.655
I’m a good waiter. Got two kids,
a wife, a mother on social security.

01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:10.059
So my daytime job...
I’m a waiter, that’s what I am.

01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:14.253
On applications it says "occupation",
I put "dancer".

01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:17.054
I always get fired from waiter jobs.

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:20.775
One time late, sure,
but auditions, never.

01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:26.179
One of my kids... like my wife
says... But on applications?

01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:30.419
Tuesday, Wednesday.
Summer, winter. I mean, Jesus...

01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:36.331
I’ve got the sweetest little wife
in the world, but...

01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:41.980
I don’t know.

01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:52.499
Before madam makes a big deal
out of it, -

01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:57.171
- Cassie is waiting in the prop room
until the rain stops.

01:03:57.380 --> 01:04:01.419
I don’t think she’s been working much.

01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:08.537
- Is that it? She needs money?
- I don’t know, talk to her.

01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:20.654
Val?

01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:29.574
- Larry, is the loading door closed?
- I"II get it.

01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:33.739
- Go ahead, Val. I’m sorry.
- Let’s get one thing straight.

01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:38.536
I never saw "The Red Shoes".
I don’t give a shit about it.

01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:43.052
I came to New York to become
a Rockette at Radio City.

01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:47.333
This girl in my home town,
Betty Lou Heiner, -

01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:53.012
- she made it in New York.
She was a Rockette.

01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:59.090
She came home for Christmas,
and they gave her a parade.

01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:02.258
A goddamn parade.

01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:07.978
I had to twirl a frigging baton
in the pouring rain for two hours.

01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:14.619
Unfortunately, she got knocked up
over Christmas. Merry Christmas...

01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:19.775
My plan was to be a Rockette.

01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:24.656
But the problem was, I was so ugly
you wouldn’t believe it.

01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:27.135
Homely, skinny, -

01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:32.255
- flat as a pancake.
But there I was.

01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:36.772
I got off the bus in my white tights,
little white dress, -

01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:41.337
- my little white shoes.
I looked like a fucking nurse.

01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:47.729
Six months later I auditioned at
Radio City. What did the man say?

01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:53.776
He didn’t like my fan kicks.
I can do terrific fan kicks!

01:05:53.980 --> 01:06:00.453
So I said, "Screw you, Radio City.
I’m going to make it on Broadway. "

01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:04.858
Every audition I danced rings
around the other girls -

01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:07.415
- and wound up with the rejects.

01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:13.889
Until one day, after an audition,
I swiped my dance card.

01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:19.857
On a scale of one to ten
they gave me 10 for the dance, -

01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:24.576
- but for looks: 3.

01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:29.137
<i>Dance: 10, looks: 3
and still on unemployment</i>

01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:33.618
<i>Dancing for my own enjoyment,
that aunt it, kid</i>

01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:38.018
<i>Dance: 10, looks: 3
is like to die</i>

01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:42.293
<i>Left the theater, called the doctor
for my appointment to buy</i>

01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:46.971
<i>Tits and ass
bought myself a fancy pair</i>

01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:51.696
<i>Tightened up the derriere
did the nose, all that goes with it</i>

01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:56.132
<i>Tits and ass,
had the bingo-bongos done</i>

01:06:56.340 --> 01:06:59.935
<i>Suddenly I’m getting national tours</i>

01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:02.290
<i>Tits and ass</i>

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:04.456
<i>won’t get you jobs</i>

01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:09.290
<i>unless they’re yours</i>

01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:14.096
<i>Didn’t cost a fortune neither
didn’t ruin my sex life either</i>

01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:18.578
<i>Flat and sassy
I’d get the strays and losers</i>

01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:22.568
<i>Beggars can’t be choosers,
that aunt it, kid</i>

01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:27.251
<i>Fixed that chassis:
"How do you do?"</i>

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:31.658
<i>Life turned into an endless medley
of "Gee, it had to be you"</i>

01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:34.055
<i>Tits and ass</i>

01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:38.299
<i>Where the cupboard once was bare
now you knock, someone’s there</i>

01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:41.173
<i>You’ve got "em, top to bottom</i>

01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:45.532
<i>It’s a gas
just a dash of silicone</i>

01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:49.528
<i>Shake your new maracas
and you’re fine</i>

01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:53.892
<i>Tits and ass
can change your life</i>

01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:58.218
<i>They sure changed mine.</i>

01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:05.695
You’re all looking at my tits now,
aren’t you?

01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:08.460
I’d settle for one.

01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:11.379
Go out and buy them.

01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:14.413
<i>Have it all done</i>

01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:18.693
<i>Honey, take my word</i>

01:08:18.899 --> 01:08:23.337
<i>Grab a cab and see the wizard
on Park and 73rd</i>

01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:26.372
<i>Tits and ass</i>

01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:29.856
<i>Orchestra and balcony</i>

01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:32.938
<i>What they want is what you see</i>

01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:35.973
<i>Do the best of you</i>

01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:40.298
<i>Pits or class
I have never seen it fail</i>

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:44.493
<i>Debutante or chorus girl or wife</i>

01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:48.978
<i>Tits and ass
yes, tits and ass</i>

01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:53.537
<i>have changed</i>

01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:57.573
<i>my life.</i>

01:09:00.979 --> 01:09:03.971
Thank you, Val.

01:09:09.779 --> 01:09:11.975
Paul.

01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:20.295
- When did you start dancing?
- Not until pretty late.

01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:25.893
- Why?
- I don’t know, I just didn’t.

01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:30.059
- What did you do?
- Nothing much.

01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:38.377
- What was your family like?
- We were close.

01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:41.457
- Any brothers and sisters?
- Two sisters.

01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:44.094
One died when I was 14.

01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:49.932
- How?
- I don’t want to talk about that.

01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:54.418
Why do we have to talk about that?

01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:57.976
Okay, Paul. Back in line.

01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:24.613
Can he keep us standing here
this long?

01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:29.336
Zach? We’ve been standing here
for quite a while.

01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:32.930
Maybe we can take a five?

01:10:37.060 --> 01:10:42.054
- Take five, everybody.
- Five means five, not fifteen.

01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:48.899
Stanley, can I have
the One routine after the insert?

01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:12.659
Uncle Harry’s heartburn kit.
One indigestible cold pastrami, -

01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:15.613
- one lukewarm celery tonic.

01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:20.940
- I’m catching the 6:30 plane.
- I just talked to Zach.

01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:26.294
What’s the point? He doesn’t think
I came here for a job.

01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:34.294
Tell me the truth.
When I left, how did he take it?

01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:42.216
How did I know
he wanted me back?

01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:48.768
Because he didn’t ring me once
to beg me to come back.

01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:51.653
As if I would.

01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:55.694
He can be sweet and funny,
and even warm.

01:11:57.540 --> 01:12:04.696
Do me a favor. He is what he is,
so just stop talking about him.

01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:16.892
Zach asked me to give you this:
The number of his business manager.

01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:21.651
- He thought you might need...
- Money?

01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:29.530
- He didn’t mean...
- "If I need some money!"

01:12:29.740 --> 01:12:32.652
- All he meant...
- Please.

01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:37.651
If you change your mind
about going back...

01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:52.896
My sister was such a little brat.

01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:57.412
But I guess it was a little extreme
shaving her head.

01:12:57.620 --> 01:13:04.059
Want to hear about the first time
I saw a dead body? I was about seven.

01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:09.693
Where the hell is Larry?

01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:17.529
Everybody, go downstairs and
learn the lyrics to the One routine.

01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:33.817
- Cassie... I’m trying to work.
- Me, too.

01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:40.095
I don’t need a handout, I need a job.
It’s my turn to audition.

01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:44.657
No. You shouldn’t have come.
This is for chorus.

01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:48.250
- It’s not for you.
- It’s the only place for me.

01:13:48.460 --> 01:13:54.615
I never had an apartment in my life
that wasn’t a sublet.

01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:59.257
AII I know how to do
is to point my toes and leap.

01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:01.576
<i>Zach, I’m a dancer</i>

01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:04.575
<i>That’s who I am</i>

01:14:04.780 --> 01:14:07.977
<i>What I do</i>

01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:11.536
<i>I’m a dancer</i>

01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:16.691
<i>Give me the steps,
I"II come through</i>

01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:21.132
<i>Give me somebody to dance for
somebody to show</i>

01:14:21.620 --> 01:14:29.334
<i>Let me wake up to find
I have somewhere exciting to go</i>

01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:34.819
Christ, Cassie, how can I put you
in the line? You’re too good.

01:14:35.020 --> 01:14:38.012
You bet I am.
I can dance any way you want.

01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:42.816
<i>Let me dance for you
let me try</i>

01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:45.136
<i>Let me dance for you</i>

01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:49.128
<i>We made a lot of music dancing,
you and I</i>

01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:53.253
- Are you talking about us?
- No.

01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:57.772
I’m talking about a job,
I haven’t worked in over a year.

01:14:57.980 --> 01:15:01.973
<i>Please, give me an answer</i>

01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:05.490
<i>Give me a place to begin</i>

01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:12.058
<i>I’m a dancer</i>

01:15:12.260 --> 01:15:14.615
<i>I have come home</i>

01:15:14.820 --> 01:15:18.972
<i>Let me in,
give me somebody to dance with</i>

01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:21.614
<i>Give me somebody to be</i>

01:15:21.820 --> 01:15:29.215
<i>Let me wake up feeling proud
that the girl in the mirror is me</i>

01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:33.936
<i>Let me dance for you,
let me try</i>

01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:36.449
<i>Let me dance for you</i>

01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:41.859
<i>We made a lot of music dancing,
you and I</i>

01:18:34.260 --> 01:18:36.728
<i>Let me dance for you</i>

01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:39.613
<i>Let me try</i>

01:18:39.820 --> 01:18:41.856
<i>Let me dance for you</i>

01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:45.609
<i>We made a lot of music dancing,
you and I.</i>

01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:48.288
Cassie!

01:18:57.100 --> 01:19:01.969
All right. Go down to the others
and learn the Lyrics.

01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:05.297
We'll see.

01:19:39.820 --> 01:19:42.095
Yes, Paul?

01:19:42.300 --> 01:19:48.330
I wanted to ask: If I can’t talk
about myself, I’m out?

01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:54.412
You’re a hell of a dancer, Paul.

01:19:54.620 --> 01:19:59.694
I can’t do it. I wish I could,
but I just can’t.

01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:05.732
Can I ask you something?
Of you’re gonna change your name, -

01:20:05.940 --> 01:20:09.615
- why take something Italian?

01:20:09.820 --> 01:20:14.336
People always used to say
I don’t look Puerto Rican.

01:20:14.540 --> 01:20:18.977
- You figure you look Italian?
- No.

01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:25.779
I just wanted to be somebody new,
so I became Paul San Marco.

01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:30.656
Why would you want to be
somebody new?

01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:36.578
I don’t know.
I’m not too proud of myself, I guess.

01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:39.613
Why did you become a dancer?

01:20:39.820 --> 01:20:44.769
My father loves movies.
He used to take us to 42nd Street.

01:20:44.980 --> 01:20:47.574
I loved the musicals.

01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:50.613
- How old were you?
- 10-11.

01:20:50.820 --> 01:20:56.292
- 42nd Street, with all those crazies?
- He didn’t know that. It was cheap.

01:20:56.500 --> 01:21:03.736
Anyway, because of my eyes...
I wear contacts now...

01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:08.855
...I’d have to move down front
by myself, so I could see.

01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:14.259
Strange men would sit beside me
and play with me...

01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:22.055
- Look, if this is too rough...
- No. I knew I was gay.

01:21:22.260 --> 01:21:26.139
In school, they’d whistle at me
in the halls.

01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:30.128
What bothered me was I didn’t know
how to be a man.

01:21:30.340 --> 01:21:33.969
What was your first job as a dancer?

01:21:34.180 --> 01:21:37.809
At the Jewel Box, the drag show.

01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:43.652
I was 15. I went to audition, but
they weren’t interested in my dancing.

01:21:43.860 --> 01:21:49.776
They said, "Show us your legs". They
took me to a filthy rat hole, -

01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:54.849
- shaved my legs and put stockings
and high heels on me.

01:21:55.060 --> 01:22:00.214
I was in show business. The asshole
of show business, but a job.

01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:06.290
- What did you tell your parents?
- Just that I was a dancer in a show.

01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:11.620
- They couldn’t stop bragging.
- Go on.

01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:18.692
The show was going to Chicago,
and my parents came to say goodbye.

01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:22.017
I don’t know why I said okay.

01:22:22.220 --> 01:22:27.772
We were doing an Oriental number.
I had an Oriental dress -

01:22:27.980 --> 01:22:32.212
- with an enormous head dress
with gold balls all over.

01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:37.414
I was going out for the finale
when I saw my parents standing there.

01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:41.408
They got there too early.
I freaked out.

01:22:41.620 --> 01:22:46.933
I ran past them,
hoping they wouldn’t recognize me.

01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:54.694
But when I passed I heard my mother
say, "Oh, my God. " I died.

01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:58.210
After the show I took off my make-up
and dressed.

01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:01.810
I didn’t know if they were
still downstairs.

01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:05.617
But there they were,
in the middle of these freaks.

01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:10.735
You should have seen them.
They didn’t know where to look.

01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:14.057
My mother had the guts
to look me in the eyes.

01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:20.537
I could tell she’d been crying.
"Make sure you eat good," she said.

01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:24.369
My father couldn’t even look at me.

01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:28.255
"Take care of yourself," he said.
They started out.

01:23:28.460 --> 01:23:33.295
But then my father turned around
and went over to the producer.

01:23:34.020 --> 01:23:36.773
"Take care of my son," he said.

01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:41.735
That was the first time
he ever called me that.

01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:53.498
Come on.

01:24:03.380 --> 01:24:06.019
Are you okay?

01:24:09.060 --> 01:24:12.132
Go grab a hat.

01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:24.819
Bring them in.

01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:26.931
Everybody on stage, let’s go!

01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:42.451
Take one that fits.

01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:48.011
This combination goes with the Lyrics
you just learned. Spread out.

01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:54.498
I want to see unison dancing.

01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:58.579
Every head, arm, body angle,
exactly the same.

01:24:58.780 --> 01:25:04.093
I don’t want anybody to pull
my focus.

01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:11.330
Let’s review it.
Starting position is upstage.

01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:13.974
Chin up, head down.

01:25:14.180 --> 01:25:18.890
Pop the right heel,
reverse directions.

01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:23.737
<i>One singular sensation</i>

01:25:23.940 --> 01:25:27.694
<i>every little step she takes</i>

01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:32.496
You with us? On "singular sensation"
make sure your arm goes -

01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:37.899
- all the way across your face
and back to shoulder.

01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:42.616
<i>...singular sensation
every little step she takes</i>

01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:49.055
<i>One thrilling combination
every move that she makes</i>

01:25:49.260 --> 01:25:55.733
<i>One smile and suddenly
nobody else will do</i>

01:25:55.940 --> 01:26:02.857
<i>You know you’ll never be lonely
with you know who</i>

01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:07.339
Let’s go on,
away from the mirrors.

01:26:07.540 --> 01:26:11.089
- When do we pop the chin?
- On two.

01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:14.258
- When does the hat go up?
- On five...

01:26:14.460 --> 01:26:17.372
Listen up!

01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:22.256
Larry’s got the style I’m looking for.
Very thirties. Watch him.

01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:27.250
Continue from
"moment in her presence... "

01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:33.535
<i>One moment in her presence
and you can forget the rest</i>

01:26:33.740 --> 01:26:40.134
<i>For the girl is second best
to none</i>

01:26:40.340 --> 01:26:43.412
<i>Give her your attention</i>

01:26:43.620 --> 01:26:46.657
<i>Do I really have to mention</i>

01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:52.059
<i>She’s the one.</i>

01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:54.933
Now in groups of four.

01:26:55.140 --> 01:26:59.531
I want to hear the Lyrics
in each group.

01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:53.097
Okay, just the girls.

01:28:00.300 --> 01:28:02.973
Cassie, don’t roll the shoulders.

01:28:06.020 --> 01:28:08.329
Diana, sharp in with the leg.

01:28:20.380 --> 01:28:22.814
Cassie, no release in the head.

01:28:27.220 --> 01:28:32.499
Cassie! Do it again with the boys.
You’re doing too much.

01:28:33.900 --> 01:28:36.255
Don’t pop the head.

01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:55.697
Cassie, this isn"t Vegas.

01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:05.451
Look around.
Get your kicks even.

01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:15.335
Goddamnit, Cassie,
you’re disturbing the combination!

01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:18.612
From the top!

01:30:02.340 --> 01:30:04.934
Come here!

01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:23.290
Look at the routine.
Is that what you really want?

01:31:04.300 --> 01:31:07.929
- That’s who I am.
- No, you’re special.

01:31:08.140 --> 01:31:12.179
They’re all special. Paul, Bebe,
Sheila... Everybody up there.

01:31:12.380 --> 01:31:15.850
You know what I’m talking about.

01:31:16.060 --> 01:31:19.132
Look at them. Look at them!

01:31:24.340 --> 01:31:28.538
- Why did you leave me?
- Why, you noticed...

01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:33.177
- You said nothing about Hollywood.
- You’d just tell me to take it.

01:31:33.380 --> 01:31:36.850
- I didn’t want you to tell me.
- You took it!

01:31:37.060 --> 01:31:41.212
That’s one thing. Your telling me
to take it is something else.

01:31:41.420 --> 01:31:45.299
Anyway, you’re the one who left,
months before I went to Hollywood.

01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:48.572
- We were living together!
- In the same apartment.

01:31:48.780 --> 01:31:52.693
- But when did I see you?
- Oh, the neglected woman?

01:31:52.900 --> 01:31:55.812
Are you jealous of my work?

01:31:57.460 --> 01:32:00.930
<i>- You were so proud I made it...
- I was proud.</i>

01:32:01.140 --> 01:32:04.815
And I know that directing a show
takes 24 hours.

01:32:05.020 --> 01:32:10.572
As long as I spend an equal 24 hours
with you? Could you tell me how?

01:32:10.780 --> 01:32:15.695
<i>If I knew that,
you’d be asking me for a job.</i>

01:32:27.060 --> 01:32:33.169
Don’t you know why I took that job
in Hollywood? Not for me, for you.

01:32:33.380 --> 01:32:37.851
It was the only way
I could hold you, I thought.

01:32:38.060 --> 01:32:41.496
To be a star like you.

01:32:41.700 --> 01:32:47.457
Make you want me again.
Treat me important.

01:32:50.260 --> 01:32:53.730
Ready, Zach?
Who do you want to pick?

01:32:57.420 --> 01:33:02.733
I don’t know yet.
Let’s do the tap combination.

01:33:02.940 --> 01:33:08.617
The tap combination will start
after the second eight count.

01:33:14.620 --> 01:33:19.614
Girls downstage, boys upstage.
Nice and easy.

01:33:32.860 --> 01:33:37.536
<i>Kiss today goodbye</i>

01:33:37.740 --> 01:33:42.495
<i>The sweetness and the sorrow</i>

01:33:44.180 --> 01:33:51.655
<i>Wish me luck,
the same to you</i>

01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:57.693
<i>But I can’t regret
what I did for love</i>

01:33:57.900 --> 01:34:02.496
<i>What I did for love</i>

01:34:04.180 --> 01:34:09.618
<i>Look, my eyes are dry</i>

01:34:09.820 --> 01:34:14.610
<i>The gift was ours to borrow</i>

01:34:14.820 --> 01:34:22.170
<i>It’s as if we always knew</i>

01:34:22.380 --> 01:34:27.170
<i>And I won’t regret
what I did for love</i>

01:34:27.380 --> 01:34:32.056
<i>What I did for love</i>

01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:42.177
<i>Gone
love is never gone</i>

01:34:42.380 --> 01:34:47.010
<i>As we travel on</i>

01:34:47.220 --> 01:34:52.374
<i>Love’s what we'll remember</i>

01:34:52.580 --> 01:34:56.892
<i>Kiss today goodbye</i>

01:34:57.100 --> 01:35:02.015
<i>And point me toward tomorrow</i>

01:35:02.220 --> 01:35:09.854
<i>We did what we had to do</i>

01:35:10.060 --> 01:35:18.058
<i>Won’t forget, can’t regret
what I did for love</i>

01:35:18.260 --> 01:35:23.653
<i>What I did for love</i>

01:35:24.700 --> 01:35:32.653
<i>What I did for love</i>

01:35:42.260 --> 01:35:49.132
We’ll put you into groups of four.
Mike, Maggie, Paul, Connie...

01:35:49.340 --> 01:35:53.253
Girls downstage, boys upstage.

01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:02.619
Connie, smile bigger,
if you gotta fake it.

01:36:02.820 --> 01:36:06.210
- Tapping is not my strong point.
- What?

01:36:06.420 --> 01:36:11.414
- Tapping’s not my strongest point.
- I see that.

01:36:17.260 --> 01:36:19.649
I"II be right back.

01:36:30.540 --> 01:36:34.658
- Don’t move him.
- Larry. Call Dr. Rhodes.

01:36:37.300 --> 01:36:43.057
- His knee was operated last year.
- Don’t move it.

01:36:44.740 --> 01:36:47.573
I just twisted it.

01:36:47.780 --> 01:36:50.658
Does anyone have Valium?

01:36:53.220 --> 01:36:55.859
It’s already swelling.

01:36:57.180 --> 01:36:59.853
You’re gonna be okay, Paul.

01:37:00.060 --> 01:37:03.530
Should we give him that?
We don’t know what’s wrong.

01:37:03.740 --> 01:37:06.937
I’ve had three already, since lunch.

01:37:07.140 --> 01:37:09.938
It’s just a muscle relaxer.

01:37:10.140 --> 01:37:15.294
Rhodes is waiting in Emergency
at St. Joseph’s.

01:37:16.580 --> 01:37:20.698
You’re going to be all right. Rhodes
is the best knee doctor in town.

01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:24.495
- Paul, I’ve got your bag!
- Good luck.

01:37:24.700 --> 01:37:27.453
Call me from the hospital.

01:37:47.380 --> 01:37:51.373
Do you ever think about what
you’ll do when you stop dancing?

01:37:51.580 --> 01:37:54.014
Me?

01:37:56.260 --> 01:37:58.899
Real life, I guess.

01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:02.058
Getting married, having babies?

01:38:03.860 --> 01:38:06.738
Going off my diet.

01:38:11.980 --> 01:38:16.132
Mark, do you want spend your life
dancing in a chorus?

01:38:16.340 --> 01:38:20.253
I just want to get in one.

01:38:20.460 --> 01:38:25.454
You don’t remember, but we were in
a chorus together a 100 years ago.

01:38:25.660 --> 01:38:30.370
- Of course I remember.
- You were a rotten dancer.

01:38:30.580 --> 01:38:35.415
Why do you think I became
a choreographer?

01:38:35.620 --> 01:38:39.454
- How have you been, Sheila?
- Since then, I don’t know...

01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:44.415
Good. Terrific. So-so...

01:38:44.620 --> 01:38:47.532
I actually found
the glass slipper once.

01:38:47.740 --> 01:38:52.211
It fit, but then it broke.

01:38:52.420 --> 01:38:58.575
I have a daughter. She’s nine.
She loves me a lot, hates me a lot...

01:38:59.380 --> 01:39:04.534
And... God help her,
she wants to be a dancer.

01:39:06.060 --> 01:39:12.499
What’s so wrong about that?
How can anybody want anything else?

01:39:15.460 --> 01:39:20.534
I used to stand outside the stage door
and watch the girls come out, -

01:39:20.740 --> 01:39:25.336
- thinking, "God, can anything
like that ever happen to me?"

01:39:25.540 --> 01:39:28.771
Now I meet somebody and they say:

01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:34.259
"Wow, you dance on Broadway?
You got somewhere. "

01:39:50.700 --> 01:39:54.773
- Hell of a day, huh?
- Yeah...

01:39:54.980 --> 01:40:00.100
A few months ago, the night before
I was to audition for another show, -

01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:04.532
- I had a kind of breakdown.

01:40:04.740 --> 01:40:09.814
I started crying and I couldn’t stop
for two weeks.

01:40:10.020 --> 01:40:15.253
I just got out of hospital.
The doctor said it was too soon.

01:40:15.460 --> 01:40:17.928
But I did.

01:40:18.140 --> 01:40:22.930
And now, even if I lose, I won.

01:40:29.260 --> 01:40:31.820
Hell of a day.

01:40:50.980 --> 01:40:54.052
- Line "em up, Zach?
- Yeah.

01:40:54.260 --> 01:40:57.297
Everybody on the line.

01:41:26.740 --> 01:41:31.097
Before we start eliminating...

01:41:31.300 --> 01:41:36.135
You’re all terrific.
And very special.

01:41:36.340 --> 01:41:39.138
I wish I could hire you all.

01:41:39.340 --> 01:41:42.935
Will the following people
please step forward.

01:41:45.460 --> 01:41:46.859
Judy.

01:41:51.540 --> 01:41:53.019
Don.

01:41:58.220 --> 01:42:01.018
Greg.

01:42:04.060 --> 01:42:06.699
Sheila.

01:42:12.300 --> 01:42:15.417
Al.

01:42:17.620 --> 01:42:19.929
Diana.

01:42:20.140 --> 01:42:24.213
Excuse me...
Diana, will you get back in line?

01:42:27.260 --> 01:42:29.535
Kristine.

01:42:32.500 --> 01:42:35.139
Connie.

01:42:38.060 --> 01:42:40.335
Maggie.

01:42:45.700 --> 01:42:49.454
Front line, thank you very much.
I’m sorry.

01:43:18.620 --> 01:43:23.216
Rehearsals begin September 22nd.
We rehearse for six weeks -

01:43:23.420 --> 01:43:28.414
- with a two-week tryout,
either in Boston or Philadelphia.

01:43:28.620 --> 01:43:34.331
The New York opening will be
some time mid-January.

01:43:34.540 --> 01:43:40.012
Prepare to sign the standard minimum
contract with a six-month rider.

01:43:42.340 --> 01:43:47.414
Check with Larry
for your costume measurings.

01:43:51.300 --> 01:43:57.455
Do not, I repeat, do not change
your hairstyle or color.

01:43:57.660 --> 01:44:03.895
I’m happy to be working with you.
It’s going to be very exciting.

01:44:12.700 --> 01:44:15.339
Thank you very much.

01:44:26.380 --> 01:44:30.931
Dick! That’s it. Thanks a lot.

01:44:52.460 --> 01:44:54.928
Cassie...

01:45:07.700 --> 01:45:10.339
How you dress!

01:45:15.860 --> 01:45:20.297
You can get arrested for wearing
those colors.

01:45:57.540 --> 01:46:00.816
<i>One singular sensation</i>

01:46:01.020 --> 01:46:04.376
<i>Every little step she takes</i>

01:46:04.580 --> 01:46:07.697
<i>One thrilling combination</i>

01:46:07.900 --> 01:46:11.495
<i>Every move that she makes</i>

01:46:11.700 --> 01:46:18.617
<i>One smile and suddenly
nobody else will do</i>

01:46:18.820 --> 01:46:25.498
<i>You know you’ll never be lonely
with you know who.</i>

01:46:26.305 --> 01:46:32.702
