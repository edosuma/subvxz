WEBVTT

00:09.801 --> 00:11.220
Hey! Hey!

00:12.429 --> 00:13.764
You got a problem with living?

00:16.475 --> 00:18.477
You feeling frisky today, Meyers?

00:19.770 --> 00:21.021
Make your move.

00:21.188 --> 00:22.856
l'm begging you.

00:26.068 --> 00:27.319
Didn't think so.

00:39.915 --> 00:43.418
- Kody, are you okay?
- Oh, look, he's following me.

00:43.585 --> 00:45.712
- l think he's in love.
- Come on, guys.

00:53.178 --> 00:54.513
Hey! No!

00:57.599 --> 00:58.851
No one else leaves.

01:00.561 --> 01:01.645
Okay!

01:54.240 --> 01:55.325
Oh, my God. Hurry up.

01:59.204 --> 02:01.623
Gibbs is already on the scene.
You two follow my lead.

02:01.790 --> 02:04.459
lt's not my first time
at this particular kind of dance.

02:04.626 --> 02:06.086
Yeah, l've been
to a few myself, Tony.

02:06.253 --> 02:07.879
<i>Know what,
l play Counter Strike online.</i>

02:08.045 --> 02:09.172
lt's pretty realistic.

02:09.339 --> 02:12.008
Well, you only get one
life here, Elf Lord.

02:13.510 --> 02:15.011
Kid's in a classroom
in the south wing.

02:15.178 --> 02:17.222
SRT's set up a command post
in the east wing.

02:17.689 --> 02:21.109
McGee, Ziva, recon the exterior.
Put the gear down.

02:22.569 --> 02:23.945
DiNozzo. With me.

02:28.157 --> 02:29.617
On your six, boss.

02:33.288 --> 02:36.249
Target's name is Kody Meyers,
1 5 years old.

02:36.416 --> 02:38.001
According to the witness,
he came to class

02:38.167 --> 02:40.003
with a bomb strapped to his chest.

02:40.169 --> 02:42.005
We set a perimeter
outside the classroom.

02:42.171 --> 02:43.881
Evacuated all nonessentials.

02:44.048 --> 02:45.925
EOD's on site
sweeping for secondaries.

02:46.092 --> 02:47.677
- How many hostages?
- Four, maybe five.

02:47.844 --> 02:49.554
Men are doing a head count
on the student body.

02:49.721 --> 02:51.514
The witness describe the device?

02:51.681 --> 02:54.350
She was rushed to emergency
being treated for a panic attack.

02:54.517 --> 02:55.894
DiNozzo, find out who
Kody Meyers is.

02:56.060 --> 02:57.770
- Get his parents in here.
- On it.

02:57.937 --> 02:59.772
- He try to make contact?
- No, sir. Not a word.

02:59.939 --> 03:01.566
We didn't try to
establish communication.

03:01.733 --> 03:03.484
Figured that was your job.

03:10.074 --> 03:11.200
Ziva.

03:13.328 --> 03:14.746
Ziva!

03:15.330 --> 03:18.750
l am here. We need to be stealthy.

03:29.427 --> 03:31.596
New shoes.

03:33.598 --> 03:35.975
- l'm going to that transformer.
- Okay.

03:37.393 --> 03:39.354
l meant alone.

03:40.430 --> 03:42.265
Got you.

04:02.618 --> 04:04.579
Come on, boy. Show me your bomb.

04:25.141 --> 04:28.227
- lt's okay.
- Stop doing that.

04:29.228 --> 04:32.023
l can't help it.

04:33.733 --> 04:34.859
You gotta try.

04:36.736 --> 04:37.862
What, what's wrong with her?

04:38.029 --> 04:39.447
She has asthma, Kody.

04:44.243 --> 04:46.162
What does she need?
Water or something?

04:46.329 --> 04:47.955
She needs her inhaler.

04:51.584 --> 04:54.253
- lt's not here. Where is it?
- My locker.

04:59.342 --> 05:01.636
Classroom's around the corner,
second door on the right.

05:01.803 --> 05:03.638
The rooms can only be locked
with a faculty key.

05:03.805 --> 05:05.098
Kody wouldn't have access.

05:07.767 --> 05:09.519
My TAC team is ready to go.

05:09.685 --> 05:11.437
Snipers are moving
into position outside.

05:12.355 --> 05:13.606
lf you wanna take him down.

05:13.773 --> 05:17.068
- Any other way into the room?
- One door and a wall of windows.

05:17.235 --> 05:19.821
Blueprints are on their way
so we can check for ducts.

05:33.376 --> 05:34.961
Boss!

05:36.712 --> 05:38.840
<i>- Sorry.
- Come.</i>

05:44.679 --> 05:45.721
l found Kody's father.

05:45.888 --> 05:47.640
He was at a conference
in Washington D.C.

05:47.807 --> 05:49.392
MPs are escorting him now.

05:49.559 --> 05:52.311
l just thought you'd want
to know before you go in there.

05:55.773 --> 05:57.233
l'll head back now.

06:02.738 --> 06:05.825
Kody Meyers.
Special Agent Gibbs, NClS.

06:06.325 --> 06:08.119
- Kody.
- Get away from the door.

06:08.286 --> 06:10.913
- Talk to me first.
- Get away from the door

06:11.080 --> 06:12.457
or l blow this thing!

06:13.124 --> 06:14.792
All right.

06:18.087 --> 06:20.757
- l'm sending someone out.
- l'll be right back.

06:22.759 --> 06:25.887
Make sure you're the one
who brings it back, okay?

06:34.061 --> 06:35.938
l'm coming out!

06:41.652 --> 06:43.905
Debrief her.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.907
lt's okay.

06:52.705 --> 06:55.500
- l need to get Nadia's inhaler.
- We're getting it.

06:55.666 --> 06:57.251
- She needs it.
- That's what we're doing.

06:57.418 --> 06:58.920
- She can't breathe!
- Stephanie,

06:59.420 --> 07:01.547
we're getting it
from her locker, okay?

07:02.924 --> 07:04.759
Tell me what happened.

07:07.470 --> 07:09.680
l was in homeroom

07:10.264 --> 07:12.767
and l heard Joe messing
with Kody.

07:14.811 --> 07:17.647
And then all of a sudden
it got really quiet

07:17.814 --> 07:22.026
and l looked up
and Kody unzipped his sweatshirt.

07:24.529 --> 07:26.405
And he had a bomb!

07:26.572 --> 07:28.366
- Okay, what kind of bomb?
- Like in the movies.

07:28.533 --> 07:30.993
lt was strapped to his chest.

07:31.160 --> 07:33.830
Okay, that's really good, Stephanie.

07:34.330 --> 07:35.873
Was he calm?

07:36.416 --> 07:39.335
He was acting really weird. He--

07:39.502 --> 07:40.920
He was talking to himself.

07:41.087 --> 07:42.880
Okay.

07:44.799 --> 07:46.884
- What about Nadia?
- We're helping her.

07:47.051 --> 07:49.178
That's what we're doing right now.

07:50.930 --> 07:54.517
Okay, all right. l know this is hard.

07:54.684 --> 07:57.228
Stephanie, l need you to hold it
together, can you do that?

07:57.979 --> 07:59.230
Okay.

07:59.397 --> 08:02.024
Tell me a little bit about Kody.

08:04.193 --> 08:06.696
He transferred this year.

08:07.113 --> 08:09.198
He's like a loner.

08:09.699 --> 08:12.160
The football players,
they'd screw with him.

08:12.326 --> 08:14.954
- But they screw with everyone.
- Okay.

08:15.371 --> 08:17.540
Oh, my God.

08:18.875 --> 08:21.919
- ls that what this is about?
- Could be.

08:22.754 --> 08:25.256
He's gonna blow everyone up!

08:25.423 --> 08:26.883
No, he's not.

08:27.216 --> 08:30.052
Stephanie, it's gonna be okay.

08:33.389 --> 08:34.890
Boss, l got the inhaler.

08:35.892 --> 08:37.226
- See?
- l have to take it to her!

08:37.393 --> 08:39.562
That's what he said.
He said l have to get the inhaler

08:39.729 --> 08:41.813
- and l have to bring it to her.
- We'll take it to her.

08:41.981 --> 08:44.107
- She needs it!
- Okay, calm down.

08:44.275 --> 08:47.904
- DiNozzo, get her a drink.
- You got it.

08:50.239 --> 08:52.408
Okay, so we'll get you some water.

08:52.867 --> 08:55.203
Boss, you're not really gonna
send her back in there, are you?

08:57.079 --> 08:59.373
Of course not. You've got a plan.

09:02.251 --> 09:04.796
- What exactly--?
- Got background on Kody yet?

09:05.129 --> 09:07.632
l do. Searched the school records.

09:07.799 --> 09:10.093
He's an average student,
member of the chess club.

09:10.259 --> 09:15.056
- He's also in junior UN.
- Background that's useful, McGee?

09:15.223 --> 09:17.934
We've got a team now at Kody's
house collecting his computer,

09:18.101 --> 09:20.728
personal effects, to transport back
to Abby's lab.

09:23.981 --> 09:25.566
l'm gonna go back there
and supervise.

09:26.484 --> 09:27.568
Okay.

09:36.619 --> 09:38.621
What is this? Robby the robot?

09:38.788 --> 09:43.126
Sort of. lt can climb stairs,
negotiate corners, unlock doors.

09:43.292 --> 09:45.837
lmpressive.
Will it convince Kody to surrender?

09:46.003 --> 09:48.798
No. But it will deliver the inhaler
to the sick student

09:48.965 --> 09:50.883
without endangering anybody else.

09:51.050 --> 09:53.136
And its camera might get
a video of the bomb.

09:53.302 --> 09:56.222
l don't trust anything
controlled by a videogame thing.

09:56.389 --> 09:58.141
l've seen one
of these cross a minefield

09:58.307 --> 10:00.309
while under heavy fire in lraq,
Agent Gibbs.

10:00.476 --> 10:02.562
How long until this POC
is ready, captain?

10:03.146 --> 10:06.983
There's a problem with the software,
just have to run a quick diagnostic--

10:09.193 --> 10:11.571
- Twenty minutes?
- We don't have 20 minutes.

10:19.454 --> 10:21.164
Ziva,

10:21.330 --> 10:22.749
tell Tony channel two.

10:22.915 --> 10:23.958
Channel two.

10:49.517 --> 10:51.686
What the hell are you doing?

10:52.979 --> 10:55.231
- Nadia's inhaler.
- Stephanie's supposed to bring it!

10:55.398 --> 10:57.609
- Where's Stephanie?
- Safe.

10:57.775 --> 10:59.027
No.

10:59.194 --> 11:02.781
- This is all wrong.
- Give this to Nadia. l'll make it right.

11:02.947 --> 11:04.699
l'm in charge here! Not you!

11:05.325 --> 11:08.203
- You're in charge, Kody.
- Get Stephanie back in here!

11:08.620 --> 11:09.704
Not gonna do that.

11:11.498 --> 11:13.708
You're killing everyone!

11:14.626 --> 11:16.461
l'm not the one wearing the bomb.

11:17.587 --> 11:22.050
l am giving this inhaler
to Nadia now.

11:31.309 --> 11:32.977
Better?

11:33.937 --> 11:35.396
She's fine, now get out!

11:35.563 --> 11:37.232
l'm a valuable hostage, Kody.

11:37.398 --> 11:39.108
More valuable than a room
full of kids?

11:39.275 --> 11:40.985
Get out now or we all die!

11:41.152 --> 11:43.780
You're surrounded by Marines
who all think you're crazy.

11:44.364 --> 11:47.826
Kody, l'm the last chance
you have of getting out of here alive.

11:49.911 --> 11:50.995
Shut the door.

11:54.374 --> 11:56.167
Search him.

12:02.882 --> 12:04.968
<i>Like they do on Cops.</i>

12:11.057 --> 12:12.851
Empty his pockets.

12:13.393 --> 12:15.436
Now l know why Gibbs
didn't go armed.

12:15.603 --> 12:17.480
- Where's Stephanie?
- With her folks.

12:17.647 --> 12:19.691
<i>Check his ankles.</i>

12:20.942 --> 12:24.195
- This kid is pretty smart.
- He's not just smart. He's trained.

12:24.362 --> 12:26.823
<i>- Put everything on the desk.
- This could be a statement.</i>

12:26.990 --> 12:28.825
<i>- Come on!
- He's a 1 5-year-old kid.</i>

12:28.992 --> 12:31.870
Well, l've seen 1 2-year-old
suicide bombers in lsrael.

12:32.036 --> 12:34.956
- He's not a terrorist.
- He's obviously mentally disturbed.

12:35.123 --> 12:38.460
- And if that's the case, well, l think--
- l know, it's not good.

12:41.504 --> 12:42.755
He's clean, Kody.

12:44.591 --> 12:46.634
- Check his ears.
- For what?

12:46.801 --> 12:48.428
Do it.

12:52.474 --> 12:54.934
The guy's wearing
some sort of hearing aide.

12:55.810 --> 12:57.479
Take it out.

13:02.734 --> 13:03.902
Check his wrists.

13:13.369 --> 13:14.621
Step on both of them.

13:25.673 --> 13:27.884
He's very well-trained.

13:30.428 --> 13:32.096
We need eyes in that classroom.

13:32.639 --> 13:37.185
SRT snaked cameras through
the vents here and here.

13:37.352 --> 13:39.854
Both were taped shut.
Kody was covering his plates.

13:40.021 --> 13:43.024
Bases. What about that door?

13:44.567 --> 13:46.402
Now, make sure
you cover every crack.

13:46.569 --> 13:49.072
Okay, l'm on it.

13:51.866 --> 13:54.369
You have no idea
what you're dealing with here.

14:02.627 --> 14:06.005
l think it's safe to say that Kody's
got some suicidal tendencies.

14:06.172 --> 14:07.882
You should see his webpage.

14:08.049 --> 14:09.926
lt's all about death and dying.

14:10.093 --> 14:13.721
- The kid is obsessed.
- So what's your point?

14:13.888 --> 14:16.766
My point is he finally worked up
the nerve to do something about it.

14:16.933 --> 14:20.019
lt's not the kids that talk about dying
that you have to worry about, Timmy.

14:20.186 --> 14:21.312
it's the ones who stay quiet.

14:21.479 --> 14:24.649
Abby, l've been in this kid's room,
okay? lt's all black.

14:24.816 --> 14:27.235
lt's got skulls everywhere.
He listens to death metal.

14:29.237 --> 14:32.115
There is nothing wrong
with those things if you are an adult.

14:32.907 --> 14:37.287
McGee, you slaughter people online.

14:37.454 --> 14:39.164
Are you gonna become
a mass murderer?

14:39.330 --> 14:41.499
l did not take
my classroom hostage.

14:41.666 --> 14:44.002
Yeah. Did you ever think about it?

14:45.420 --> 14:49.215
You said the bomb-sniffing dogs didn't
alert to anything in Cody's house.

14:49.382 --> 14:53.511
l haven't found explosive markers
on any of his clothing or his effects.

14:53.678 --> 14:56.556
He didn't visit
any bomb-making websites.

14:56.723 --> 15:00.935
And these photos,
they show us nothing.

15:03.021 --> 15:05.523
Maybe his bomb is fake.

15:10.236 --> 15:12.197
Do you believe that?

15:13.239 --> 15:14.991
No.

15:20.580 --> 15:23.917
We can end this now, Kody. Tell me
what you want. l'll get it for you.

15:24.083 --> 15:26.377
l'm not making demands
until l speak to a negotiator.

15:27.003 --> 15:29.506
- l am the negotiator.
- They wouldn't send a negotiator

15:29.672 --> 15:31.341
busting through the door.
l'm not stupid.

15:31.508 --> 15:34.093
- No one says you are.
- Just be quiet. Hurry up!

15:34.260 --> 15:36.471
- Relax, Kody.
- Stop saying my name!

15:37.806 --> 15:39.474
You're not gonna build
a relationship with me.

15:39.641 --> 15:42.685
So keep talking
and l really will end this now.

15:49.484 --> 15:52.654
Nadia. Nadia, you have to stop that,
please. Please?

15:52.821 --> 15:57.408
- l can't. Kody, l can't.
- She's scared, Kody.

15:57.575 --> 16:00.411
- Yeah, like she's the only one.
- You're right. We're all scared.

16:00.578 --> 16:02.622
They just wanna go home
and see their parents.

16:02.789 --> 16:04.415
You expect me to identify with them.

16:04.582 --> 16:06.960
See them as people. Make it
harder for me to do anything.

16:07.127 --> 16:11.214
- They are people, Kody.
- Stop saying my name!

16:11.381 --> 16:12.715
One more word,

16:13.299 --> 16:15.009
l press this button.

16:23.643 --> 16:26.271
Director Shepard,
Dr. Mallard's here to see you.

16:26.437 --> 16:27.689
Send him in, Cynthia.

16:29.649 --> 16:30.817
Anything new?

16:32.485 --> 16:35.363
l just got off the phone
with DiNozzo. Still no contact.

16:35.530 --> 16:38.908
- What exactly happened?
- Jethro happened, Ducky.

16:39.075 --> 16:41.327
He went in to deliver
a sick girl's inhaler,

16:41.494 --> 16:45.373
- and got invited to stay.
- Yeah, but how could he--? Of course.

16:45.540 --> 16:49.043
- He probably planned the whole thing.
- Jethro doesn't plan, Ducky.

16:49.210 --> 16:50.920
He follows his damn gut.

16:51.254 --> 16:53.256
Well, it usually serves him well.

16:53.423 --> 16:56.176
lt also gets him into trouble.

16:57.385 --> 16:59.554
You would only be a hindrance
down there.

16:59.721 --> 17:03.349
- What makes you think--?
- You're wearing your sidearm.

17:05.018 --> 17:08.855
Gibbs was my partner, Ducky.
For a long time.

17:09.021 --> 17:11.566
l cannot just sit by here
and do nothing.

17:11.733 --> 17:15.444
Well, of course not.
Nobody expects you to do nothing.

17:18.906 --> 17:20.700
Cynthia?

17:22.868 --> 17:26.580
l want a direct feed into DiNozzo's
command post, ASAP.

17:26.748 --> 17:30.293
- Yes, director.
- That is a good decision, director.

17:30.460 --> 17:33.880
l'll believe that, Ducky,
when the situation is defused.

17:34.255 --> 17:36.132
Right.

17:43.598 --> 17:45.225
WWGD?

17:46.601 --> 17:47.977
ls that a weapons acronym?

17:48.561 --> 17:50.230
No.

17:50.396 --> 17:52.315
lt stands for
''What Would Gibbs Do?''

17:52.482 --> 17:55.151
Well, it's too bad we can't ask him.

17:56.653 --> 17:58.738
Captain, your teams are in place?

17:58.905 --> 18:00.740
We've got three snipers
in position, sir.

18:00.907 --> 18:04.160
- lf the target looks out the blinds--
- No one takes a shot unless l clear it.

18:04.327 --> 18:05.411
You're with me.

18:05.578 --> 18:08.790
- Where are you going?
- Talk to Kody.

18:12.585 --> 18:14.170
You wanna stay away
from the windows, Kody.

18:15.839 --> 18:19.259
What, because the snipers?
They won't shoot a kid.

18:19.425 --> 18:21.719
l wouldn't count on that.

18:27.100 --> 18:29.102
lt's not too late to fix this.

18:30.103 --> 18:32.730
You're gonna reason with me?
Go ahead. No, really. Go ahead.

18:32.897 --> 18:35.441
Convince me l'm not in trouble.

18:37.777 --> 18:40.321
No. You're in trouble.
How much is up to you.

18:41.030 --> 18:43.032
What did you just do?

18:44.075 --> 18:47.620
- Nothing. Just stretching my arms.
- You just did something! What was it?

18:47.996 --> 18:50.373
Kody, this is Special Agent DiNozzo.

18:50.540 --> 18:51.708
How's Nadia?

18:53.334 --> 18:56.129
- She's fine for now.
- How are the other kids?

18:56.296 --> 18:59.299
- They're fine, okay?
- l'd love to take your word on that.

18:59.466 --> 19:02.218
But l'm gonna need some proof,
Kody. Open the door.

19:02.385 --> 19:06.556
No! No way! You try and get in here
l'm setting this off!

19:06.723 --> 19:11.478
No one's coming in. l'd like to speak
to Special Agent Gibbs.

19:12.145 --> 19:14.397
Everybody's okay, boss.

19:15.273 --> 19:18.735
Well, that's good to hear,
Special Agent Gibbs.

19:18.902 --> 19:21.988
- Your agent says he's a negotiator.
- Well, that's right. He's my best man.

19:22.155 --> 19:24.574
Your best man's a moron
for getting caught in here.

19:24.741 --> 19:26.409
He always had an attitude problem.

19:30.288 --> 19:32.165
We're all gonna work
on this together.

19:32.332 --> 19:35.251
- What do you say to that, Kody?
- You know, l want the man in charge.

19:35.418 --> 19:38.087
Not the field commander. The one
who makes the final decision.

19:38.254 --> 19:39.672
That's me, Kody.

19:39.839 --> 19:41.508
lf l ask for a plane
and a million dollars,

19:41.674 --> 19:42.842
you just give it to me?

19:46.054 --> 19:48.389
- ls that what you want?
- Answer my question!

19:48.556 --> 19:51.434
- l'll make some calls.
- Are you the man or not?

19:53.353 --> 19:55.522
l'm the one you want.

20:00.276 --> 20:02.237
Bring my mother to the classroom.

20:03.279 --> 20:07.826
No deals, no stalling.
You have until sundown.

20:08.201 --> 20:11.704
lf you can't do that,

20:12.413 --> 20:13.790
then everyone dies.

20:20.755 --> 20:23.049
- l want to see my son.
- That's not happening, major.

20:23.216 --> 20:25.760
- The hell it's not!
- Calm down.

20:26.719 --> 20:28.805
l need to see he's okay.

20:28.972 --> 20:31.266
Aside from holding five people
hostage, he's doing great.

20:31.432 --> 20:33.768
- What does Kody want?
- He wants his mother brought to him.

20:33.935 --> 20:36.437
- Oh, God.
- What?

20:37.397 --> 20:39.107
Kody's mother is dead.

20:50.952 --> 20:52.662
She died a year ago.

20:52.829 --> 20:54.164
A boating accident.

20:54.497 --> 20:57.083
Angela liked sailing.

20:57.250 --> 21:01.337
Kody took it--
Well, we all took it hard.

21:01.504 --> 21:04.174
- Clearly.
- Kody's had some difficulties,

21:04.340 --> 21:05.717
but he's never acted out before.

21:06.050 --> 21:08.928
Your son strapped a bomb to his
chest, kidnapped his homeroom

21:09.095 --> 21:10.847
and is demanding
to see his dead mother.

21:11.014 --> 21:13.266
l'd say he's past
the acting out stage, major.

21:13.433 --> 21:15.018
- And frankly--
- Let me talk to him.

21:15.185 --> 21:17.395
l can calm him down.
l can get him out of there.

21:17.562 --> 21:20.106
Contact with you
may only exacerbate the situation.

21:20.273 --> 21:22.942
He's my son.
He's having a breakdown.

21:23.109 --> 21:25.361
His mind is playing tricks on him.

21:25.528 --> 21:26.821
Tricks? What kind of tricks?

21:29.949 --> 21:31.951
Listen, if this is gonna end well,

21:32.118 --> 21:34.537
we need all the intel
you can give us on your son.

21:36.080 --> 21:39.584
Kody thought he saw his mother
a couple of months ago.

21:39.751 --> 21:41.669
- Alive?
- His therapist said

21:41.836 --> 21:44.506
it's completely normal,
a coping mechanism.

21:44.672 --> 21:47.217
A lot of people imagine
seeing dead loved ones.

21:47.383 --> 21:50.345
Well, it's the part
where he wants to talk to her

21:50.512 --> 21:52.180
that's got us a little worried.

21:52.555 --> 21:55.391
l saw the SRT teams
outside the school.

21:55.725 --> 21:57.811
l know what comes next.

22:00.355 --> 22:05.819
l'm begging you,
please, give my boy a chance.

22:06.319 --> 22:09.906
We'll do everything we can to get all
those kids out of there safely, major.

22:10.073 --> 22:12.450
All of them, including your son.

22:14.786 --> 22:16.454
Thank you.

22:19.833 --> 22:22.752
There are easier ways
to see your mother, Kody.

22:23.253 --> 22:24.712
lt's none of your business.

22:24.879 --> 22:27.382
You made it my business
when you threatened their lives.

22:28.758 --> 22:33.471
- lt's not up to me, okay?
- Well, who's it up to, Kody?

22:37.350 --> 22:39.519
You can't fix this.

22:39.686 --> 22:43.398
- No one can fix this.
- l don't wanna fix it.

22:43.565 --> 22:44.816
l wanna end it.

22:44.983 --> 22:47.193
You just have the answers
for everything, don't you?

22:47.360 --> 22:50.238
No! No! Don't touch me!

22:50.405 --> 22:51.906
Kody, is something wrong in there?

22:52.949 --> 22:56.202
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Giving you an update.

22:56.369 --> 22:58.746
l wanna let you know
that Special Agent Caitlin Todd

22:58.913 --> 23:00.081
is out looking for your mom.

23:00.248 --> 23:02.542
Don't come back until you find her!

23:02.709 --> 23:06.337
- l won't tell you again!
- All right, l'm going.

23:09.382 --> 23:11.968
How are you gonna tell Gibbs
the kid's mom's dead?

23:12.135 --> 23:13.219
l already did.

23:13.386 --> 23:15.305
Special Agent Todd is dead.

23:15.472 --> 23:17.557
<i>- DiNozzo.
- Hold for the director.</i>

23:17.724 --> 23:20.894
He wants his dead mother
brought to the classroom?

23:21.060 --> 23:23.354
<i>He won't accept she's dead.
Thinks he saw her recently.</i>

23:23.521 --> 23:25.774
lt's not an unusual fantasy in grief.

23:25.940 --> 23:27.734
That's an impossible demand.

23:27.901 --> 23:30.069
<i>l know, director. l'm working on it.</i>

23:30.236 --> 23:32.906
Define working on it,
Agent DiNozzo.

23:33.072 --> 23:35.992
SRT's in place, working on getting
visual access into the room

23:36.159 --> 23:38.411
<i>- and a way to contact Gibbs.
- And?</i>

23:38.578 --> 23:41.206
<i>- And we're just getting started.
- What's your deadline?</i>

23:41.372 --> 23:43.875
Sundown. About five hours.

23:44.459 --> 23:46.044
How powerful is the bomb?

23:46.669 --> 23:47.754
Don't know yet.

23:47.921 --> 23:50.924
Sciuto and Agent McGee
are going through the kid's computer

23:51.090 --> 23:54.260
and everything found in his room,
trying to work out what the explosive is.

23:54.427 --> 23:56.054
Does he have a dead-man switch?

23:56.221 --> 23:58.556
Hoping Sciuto and McGee
can tell us that.

23:58.848 --> 24:00.391
And if he doesn't?

24:01.601 --> 24:04.687
- You want me to take him out.
- lt may be your only option.

24:04.854 --> 24:06.189
<i>l'd like to get them all alive,</i>

24:06.356 --> 24:08.191
<i>- including Kody.
- l agree.</i>

24:08.358 --> 24:11.361
But if it's not possible,
l need to know that you're capable

24:11.528 --> 24:12.654
of making the call.

24:12.821 --> 24:15.824
<i>- l've done it before.
- On a 1 5-year-old?</i>

24:15.990 --> 24:17.909
<i>lf the time comes,</i>

24:18.076 --> 24:21.162
you cannot hesitate.
You cannot second guess yourself.

24:21.329 --> 24:23.331
lf you don't trust me,
l suggest you relieve me.

24:23.498 --> 24:25.834
Otherwise, leave me alone.
l've got work to do, ma'am.

24:32.757 --> 24:35.635
She asked if you had
the calzones for this, yes?

24:36.553 --> 24:38.054
<i>Cojones.</i>

24:39.139 --> 24:40.807
Do you?

24:43.226 --> 24:46.396
- Gibbs has rubbed off on him.
- Well, that's a positive thing.

24:46.563 --> 24:50.150
- He isn't Gibbs, Ducky.
- No, but he's very capable.

24:52.485 --> 24:55.196
- The boy's mother?
- Yes.

24:55.613 --> 24:56.698
Cynthia?

24:56.865 --> 24:59.325
<i>- Ma'am?
- l need the NClS case file</i>

24:59.492 --> 25:02.495
on the drowning of
Marine dependent Angela Meyers.

25:02.662 --> 25:04.747
<i>- Right away, ma'am.
- What are you up to?</i>

25:05.081 --> 25:09.294
The boy wants his mother.
We may have to give her to him.

25:15.341 --> 25:20.680
There is no way that kid assembled
that bomb at his house.

25:20.847 --> 25:22.015
Which means?

25:24.184 --> 25:28.438
Which means he either made it
somewhere else,

25:28.605 --> 25:31.816
or someone helped him.
What do you think?

25:31.983 --> 25:33.651
Sounds good.

25:34.152 --> 25:36.946
- What? What was that for?
- Not paying attention to me.

25:37.113 --> 25:39.532
l'm trying to tell you
l think there's more kids out there.

25:39.699 --> 25:42.327
- This could be part of a larger plan.
- l don't think so.

25:42.494 --> 25:45.038
Kody believes his mother
is still alive. Look at this.

25:45.205 --> 25:46.873
He's sending her photo
all over the web,

25:47.040 --> 25:50.585
asking if anyone's seen her.
He expects us to find her.

25:50.752 --> 25:52.420
This could be a good thing.

25:52.587 --> 25:54.964
There were no traces
of explosives at his house.

25:55.131 --> 25:56.299
No bomb-making materials.

25:56.466 --> 26:00.220
There were no plans or schematics
for construction on his computer.

26:00.386 --> 26:03.348
The bomb has got to be
a fake. l hope.

26:04.599 --> 26:06.267
- Oh, wow.
- Wow, what?

26:06.434 --> 26:08.853
lt would help if you could get
a better look at it, right?

26:09.020 --> 26:11.105
- How we gonna do that?
- Look. Three computers

26:11.272 --> 26:13.566
- in the back of the classroom.
- With webcams and mics.

26:13.733 --> 26:16.069
- All we have to do is hack in.
- We'll have eyes and ears

26:16.236 --> 26:18.029
and we can see the bomb.

26:19.197 --> 26:21.991
- Hey!
- Should've thought of that hours ago.

26:22.700 --> 26:25.537
- Don't be gentle.
- l am not gonna hit you.

26:25.703 --> 26:28.164
- Come on. l deserve it.
- No.

26:29.749 --> 26:31.584
Elf Lord.

26:38.007 --> 26:41.136
- l don't see squat, probie.
- Tony, are your laptops even on?

26:41.302 --> 26:42.720
Probie, now is not the time.

26:42.887 --> 26:46.099
Wait, Tony. lt's on our end, okay?
lt's still buffering.

26:46.641 --> 26:50.019
<i>- That should do it.
- You are amazing, Abby.</i>

26:50.186 --> 26:53.022
Actually, that was my idea--
Would you stop doing that?

26:53.606 --> 26:55.733
<i>Hey, cut that out!</i>

26:58.278 --> 26:59.779
Why is it so hot in here?

27:02.115 --> 27:03.908
You can walk away from this.

27:06.077 --> 27:08.872
Do you have any idea what they'll
do to me if l walk out of this building?

27:09.038 --> 27:10.165
No one will touch you.

27:10.331 --> 27:12.792
- You have no idea.
- l won't let them, Kody.

27:22.552 --> 27:24.888
What'd you--? What'd you just do?

27:25.054 --> 27:26.639
What just--? What just happened?

27:26.806 --> 27:28.725
- l don't--
- She dropped her inhaler.

27:32.437 --> 27:34.105
Let Nadia go, Kody.

27:34.272 --> 27:36.441
As a sign of good faith
while we look for your mom.

27:37.734 --> 27:40.987
No one leaves! Do you get this?

27:47.160 --> 27:50.413
Electrical blasting caps
wired into a central circuit board.

27:50.580 --> 27:53.792
Four visible charges,
all equipped with nails

27:53.958 --> 27:58.129
to inflict maximum shrapnel damage.
This is no fake bomb, Tony.

27:58.713 --> 28:03.218
Good news. The detonator appears
to be remote in his hand.

28:03.384 --> 28:05.428
- Good news?
- Well, it doesn't seem

28:05.595 --> 28:07.347
to be a dead-man's switch.

28:07.514 --> 28:11.226
A head shot will stop
this without setting off the bomb.

28:13.019 --> 28:14.395
Just like that.

28:14.771 --> 28:17.190
- Head shot.
- Oh, yeah.

28:33.331 --> 28:35.542
Tell me about your mom, Kody.

28:37.585 --> 28:39.879
- Doesn't she wanna see you?
- Don't say that.

28:41.339 --> 28:44.300
l'm just wondering why
you're threatening to blow all of us up

28:44.467 --> 28:46.636
just to see her.

28:49.389 --> 28:53.309
Because l-- l do, okay?

28:53.810 --> 28:55.353
She's dead, Kody.

28:56.980 --> 28:58.648
l know.

29:01.693 --> 29:05.822
l know l saw her. Shut up!
Shut up! Just--

29:16.875 --> 29:18.126
Target acquired.

29:18.668 --> 29:20.879
<i>l say again, target is acquired.</i>

29:22.130 --> 29:24.174
We may not get
another chance, sir.

29:25.967 --> 29:27.635
Do l have a go? Over.

29:29.429 --> 29:31.139
Tony?

29:31.931 --> 29:33.349
The shot is still good, sir. Over.

29:33.516 --> 29:35.477
Sir, we're gonna lose the target.

29:37.312 --> 29:39.439
He's not a target.
He's a 1 5-year-old boy

29:39.606 --> 29:43.026
who misses his mom.
All sniper units stand down.

29:43.193 --> 29:44.277
<i>Do not take the shot.</i>

29:44.444 --> 29:46.446
All units stand down.

29:46.613 --> 29:49.783
- Why?
- lt's a Gibbs thing.

29:51.075 --> 29:52.911
My gut.

30:10.303 --> 30:13.932
Stop! Don't! What are you doing?
Just get away from me!

30:19.145 --> 30:21.189
- He's signing.
- What's he saying?

30:21.356 --> 30:23.316
l can't tell.
He's not being obvious about it.

30:27.612 --> 30:29.489
Wait.

30:31.324 --> 30:32.742
Puppet.

30:36.830 --> 30:38.373
Yes.

30:39.207 --> 30:42.418
- Puppet. What does that mean?
- l don't know.

30:43.336 --> 30:45.922
Wait, not puppet. lt's marionette.

30:46.089 --> 30:49.259
He's saying that somebody's pulling
Kody's strings.

30:49.425 --> 30:53.179
- What, like controlling him?
- Not just controlling him, McGee.

30:53.346 --> 30:54.639
Controlling the bomb.

31:04.041 --> 31:08.545
lf somebody's controlling Kody,
they have to be talking to him.

31:09.254 --> 31:10.380
- Earwig!
- Earwig!

31:10.547 --> 31:12.299
Ask Gibbs.

31:15.052 --> 31:16.219
Wait, hold it. Hold it.

31:18.513 --> 31:19.931
Send it now.

31:26.354 --> 31:29.149
<i>- Why'd you just nod?
- What?</i>

31:29.316 --> 31:30.400
<i>- You just nodded.
- Did l?</i>

31:30.567 --> 31:32.110
<i>- Yes!
- How did he see that?</i>

31:32.277 --> 31:35.155
<i>- His back was to Gibbs.
- l don't know. Nervous? Jumpy?</i>

31:35.322 --> 31:36.490
l guess.

31:38.241 --> 31:39.910
Are you signalling someone
in this room?

31:40.243 --> 31:41.578
No.

31:43.121 --> 31:44.915
l swear.

31:46.917 --> 31:48.585
They're not just talking to Kody.

31:48.752 --> 31:51.254
They have eyes
in the classroom too, McGee.

31:51.588 --> 31:53.256
<i>- Tony, did you copy that?
- Roger.</i>

31:53.423 --> 31:55.759
Dirtbags have eyes
and ears in the classroom.

31:55.926 --> 31:57.427
Good.

31:58.428 --> 32:00.931
- Good?
- We backtrack the feeds.

32:01.098 --> 32:03.350
- lt'll lead us to them.
- Earwigs have a limited range

32:03.517 --> 32:06.311
and only a handful of frequencies. We
have the equipment here to sweep.

32:06.478 --> 32:08.021
- Do it.
- Yes, sir.

32:08.438 --> 32:10.857
Get the equipment.
Set up for a frequency sweep.

32:11.024 --> 32:12.109
Abby, SRT is sweeping

32:12.275 --> 32:13.568
<i>earwig freqs to trace the source.</i>

32:13.735 --> 32:15.278
<i>Can you do the same thing
with the eyes?</i>

32:15.445 --> 32:17.072
- McGee?
- We got three computers

32:17.239 --> 32:20.200
with webcams in the back of the
classroom. We're using one of them.

32:20.367 --> 32:22.160
- They must be using--
- The blocked router.

32:22.327 --> 32:23.954
- The one we couldn't get into.
- How long?

32:24.121 --> 32:27.124
Depends. They could be using
counter attack software.

32:27.290 --> 32:29.459
<i>lf they're using
a sophisticated encryption system,</i>

32:29.626 --> 32:31.294
it could be 1 28, even 256 bit--

32:31.461 --> 32:32.796
<i>- Probie.
- On it, boss.</i>

32:34.339 --> 32:35.966
Tony.

32:39.803 --> 32:41.972
- What?
- He called me boss.

32:42.139 --> 32:45.642
- Yeah, he'll never live that down.
- Nope.

32:51.648 --> 32:54.651
What happens if they can't find
your mom, Kody?

32:56.987 --> 32:58.572
You know what will happen.

32:58.739 --> 33:01.366
- Kody, just let us go, man.
- Shut up!

33:05.620 --> 33:08.874
Just don't ask me that again.
Okay, Nadia?

33:09.583 --> 33:11.710
Okay.

33:11.877 --> 33:14.171
You don't want to carry out
your threat, do you, Kody?

33:16.298 --> 33:17.841
No.

33:20.802 --> 33:23.513
But l will
if l don't talk to my mother.

33:24.681 --> 33:28.018
Talk or see? We might have time--

33:28.185 --> 33:31.021
See! See! l have to see her right here
in my homeroom!

33:31.188 --> 33:33.523
l'm saying that talking to her
might give us more time.

33:33.690 --> 33:35.692
There is no more time, okay?

33:35.859 --> 33:38.862
She has to be here before sunset!

33:43.533 --> 33:47.037
Nautical, civilian or astronomical?

33:49.206 --> 33:50.874
What?

33:52.167 --> 33:54.294
Which sunset? There are three.

33:55.754 --> 33:57.130
Before it gets dark.

33:57.881 --> 33:59.591
Astronomical.

34:01.134 --> 34:03.553
- How's it coming, captain?
- Narrowing it down.

34:05.639 --> 34:08.058
l can't stand doing nothing
while everyone else is working.

34:08.225 --> 34:09.768
Well, then do something.

34:10.685 --> 34:15.107
- Any suggestions, Ziva?
- Yes, DiNozzo.

34:16.024 --> 34:18.235
We didn't really have time
to question Major Meyers.

34:18.402 --> 34:20.612
He may be able to tell us
who's controlling his son.

34:22.280 --> 34:24.824
Captain, have your men bring
Major Meyers in here.

34:24.991 --> 34:26.576
That's gonna be a problem.

34:26.743 --> 34:28.829
The major was taken
to NClS Headquarters.

34:28.995 --> 34:30.414
l didn't authorize that.

34:30.580 --> 34:32.081
No, sir. Your boss did.

34:32.248 --> 34:34.418
My boss is a hostage right now.

34:34.583 --> 34:36.503
l don't think he's authorizing
much of anything.

34:37.087 --> 34:40.215
- Not that boss, sir.
- He's the only boss l have.

34:41.550 --> 34:44.469
You are forgetting the director.

34:46.096 --> 34:49.599
l'm an amphibious warfare instructor
at Command and Staff, Quantico.

34:49.766 --> 34:52.018
Are you involved
in anything sensitive?

34:52.185 --> 34:53.437
You mean like secret?

34:54.896 --> 34:58.275
No. What does this have to do
with my son?

34:58.442 --> 35:00.318
Someone is controlling him.

35:03.447 --> 35:06.116
- So this isn't his idea?
- l doubt it.

35:06.783 --> 35:08.118
Thank God.

35:08.285 --> 35:11.204
He still has a bomb
strapped to his chest.

35:11.580 --> 35:13.123
Yeah.

35:13.582 --> 35:16.209
Why would they have him
asking for his mother?

35:16.376 --> 35:18.378
l have no idea.

35:19.463 --> 35:22.257
- How long did you know her?
- Since college.

35:22.424 --> 35:25.260
We were married 1 8 years
when she died.

35:25.427 --> 35:28.138
- What did she do?
- Grade school teacher.

35:29.473 --> 35:33.810
Look, Angela had no dark side.
She loved me. She loved Kody.

35:33.977 --> 35:38.148
Whoever's doing this must have her
confused with someone else.

35:39.816 --> 35:41.318
You're probably right.

35:42.527 --> 35:45.947
Thank you for your cooperation,
major.

35:48.658 --> 35:49.826
What are you gonna do?

35:51.328 --> 35:53.205
Get him out alive.

35:53.789 --> 35:54.831
Thank you.

36:01.004 --> 36:05.509
You really think this is a bizarre case
of mistaken identity?

36:05.675 --> 36:07.219
Doesn't really matter.

36:07.386 --> 36:10.430
Every scenario plays out
exactly the same.

36:10.597 --> 36:14.851
The only way this can end well
is if we find Angela Meyers.

36:17.312 --> 36:19.398
And if she is dead?

36:22.067 --> 36:24.277
The detonator
in Kody's hand is a prop.

36:24.444 --> 36:26.530
The people controlling him
have the real one.

36:26.696 --> 36:29.366
- You think?
- Yes.

36:29.533 --> 36:33.286
l think shooting Kody wouldn't have
saved anybody in that classroom.

36:35.580 --> 36:36.873
Doesn't make you Gibbs.

36:39.418 --> 36:42.713
Someone went to a lot of trouble
to raise Angela Myers from the grave.

36:42.879 --> 36:46.216
Well, obviously he, she
or they don't believe she's dead.

36:46.383 --> 36:49.386
They intend to kill her
with a big boom.

36:49.553 --> 36:50.887
And blame it all on Kody.

36:51.054 --> 36:53.265
- Got the freq on Kody's earwig.
- Where are they?

36:53.432 --> 36:55.851
Don't know.
They're communicating in short bursts.

36:56.017 --> 36:57.436
We can't get an accurate fix.

36:58.562 --> 37:02.065
<i>The sunset esta muy hermosa, Kody.
Enjoy it.</i>

37:02.357 --> 37:05.152
<i>lt will be your last
if your mama doesn't show.</i>

37:05.318 --> 37:07.654
Look, we're running out of time.
Where's my mother?

37:07.821 --> 37:09.948
Let me talk to my boss.
l'll get a progress report.

37:11.324 --> 37:13.744
<i>Okay, put the cell phone
on speaker.</i>

37:16.580 --> 37:19.791
Do it. Put it on speaker.

37:24.963 --> 37:26.590
<i>- DiNozzo.
- Hey, boss,</i>

37:26.757 --> 37:28.759
<i>you locate Kody's mother yet?</i>

37:29.468 --> 37:32.345
Agent Todd has her phone number
and is trying to make contact.

37:32.512 --> 37:34.264
<i>- Get the number!
- What is the number?</i>

37:34.639 --> 37:36.850
l don't know, Kody.
Agent Todd is on it.

37:37.017 --> 37:39.478
<i>- Get the number!
- l want the number!</i>

37:40.437 --> 37:42.439
Better get him the number, boss.

37:42.606 --> 37:44.941
l'll contact Agent Todd
and get back to you.

37:45.984 --> 37:48.737
You had to say
you had her number?

37:49.196 --> 37:50.280
l know.

37:50.447 --> 37:53.200
- l know, it wasn't--
- A mistake Gibbs would have made?

37:55.118 --> 37:59.998
Sir, EOD's been studying
the pictures of the bomb vest.

38:00.165 --> 38:02.793
This is the remote to the detonator.
One shot could destroy it.

38:02.959 --> 38:04.127
And Kody.

38:04.294 --> 38:05.837
There's more than one life
at stake here.

38:06.004 --> 38:07.881
Okay, okay.

38:10.675 --> 38:12.636
McGee, tell me
you're making progress.

38:12.803 --> 38:14.304
We are making progress, Tony.

38:14.471 --> 38:17.516
Back-tracing their connection
to the classroom computer now.

38:18.100 --> 38:20.018
Okay, they're in Triangle, Virginia.

38:20.185 --> 38:22.020
Piggybacking off a wi-fi node

38:22.187 --> 38:24.022
at the warehouse
outside the main gate.

38:24.189 --> 38:26.316
l'm sending you the address.
Do you want us to cut

38:26.483 --> 38:28.402
<i>their connection to the webcam?</i>

38:28.902 --> 38:32.322
Negative, probie.
l got a better idea.

38:40.622 --> 38:42.874
You know what, Tony?
This might actually work.

38:43.041 --> 38:46.044
- Don't sound so surprised, probie.
- He's right, Tony.

38:46.211 --> 38:48.463
We should have thought of it.

38:48.630 --> 38:50.799
<i>- What the hell was that?
- McGee tripped.</i>

38:50.966 --> 38:53.969
<i>Trip on your own time, probie.
Can you make it happen or not?</i>

38:54.136 --> 38:56.513
The problem is finding
the right stream to mirror, Tony.

38:56.680 --> 38:58.515
We'll need to re-create
a virtual hard drive--

38:58.682 --> 38:59.933
To replace the physical one.

39:00.100 --> 39:02.018
<i>The key is the insertion phase,
we're gonna need--</i>

39:02.185 --> 39:04.730
A natural buffering period
so we won't be detected.

39:04.896 --> 39:07.441
- Using a standard codex--
- Means we'll be able to retag

39:07.607 --> 39:09.192
the algorithm during decompression.

39:09.359 --> 39:10.736
<i>What we need is a multi-point</i>

39:10.902 --> 39:15.031
<i>- control unit to enable a seamless--
- Guys, phys ed major here.</i>

39:15.532 --> 39:18.535
<i>- We can do this, Tony.
- When?</i>

39:19.077 --> 39:21.872
<i>- Now if you want.
- On my mark. DiNozzo out.</i>

39:24.374 --> 39:25.625
What was that one for?

39:25.792 --> 39:28.712
Pissing off Tony. Can't you tell
he's under a lot of pressure?

39:33.467 --> 39:35.052
<i>Answer it.</i>

39:39.389 --> 39:42.350
<i>- We're here.
- Kody, Agent DiNozzo here.</i>

39:42.517 --> 39:45.854
<i>l have some good news.
We have your mom.</i>

39:53.987 --> 39:55.238
<i>- You found her?
- Yes, we did.</i>

39:55.405 --> 39:57.657
<i>She's being escorted
onto the base as we speak.</i>

39:57.824 --> 40:00.077
<i>She should be at the school
in 20 minutes, you sit tight,</i>

40:00.243 --> 40:02.245
<i>we'll have a happy ending here.</i>

40:06.458 --> 40:07.834
<i>Okay, probie, now!</i>

40:08.835 --> 40:10.837
Do you actually think
this is gonna work?

40:11.797 --> 40:13.465
lf l tell you,
are you gonna hit me again?

40:14.049 --> 40:15.675
Yeah.

40:17.302 --> 40:19.471
Yeah.
l think it's actually gonna work.

40:20.263 --> 40:21.932
lt has to.

40:25.977 --> 40:30.607
Do you hear those sirens, Kody?
You might just survive this after all.

40:57.300 --> 40:58.885
Hi.

41:01.555 --> 41:04.641
Not bad, DiNozzo. Not bad at all.

41:07.853 --> 41:09.146
That was brilliant, Tony.

41:09.312 --> 41:11.440
Looping the classroom video
to the bad guys

41:11.606 --> 41:15.152
- while you evac'ed the kids.
- She's right. lt was a great idea, Tony.

41:15.861 --> 41:18.321
- Hey!
- Boss.

41:18.488 --> 41:20.157
lt was a great idea, boss.

41:21.366 --> 41:24.244
- Slip of the tongue, okay?
- Freudian slip of the tongue.

41:24.411 --> 41:27.497
Give it up, McGee.
Some things Tony never forgets.

41:27.664 --> 41:32.335
That's true. So, Tony, what movie
gave you the big idea?

41:32.502 --> 41:34.254
- Movie?
- Yeah.

41:34.421 --> 41:36.715
You know, making the video
of the classroom

41:36.882 --> 41:38.759
to feed back to the bad guys?

41:40.844 --> 41:42.763
lt just kind of came to me, actually.

41:43.889 --> 41:47.225
l saw it! They had these terrorists.

41:48.060 --> 41:49.936
Half the movies today
are about terrorists.

41:50.103 --> 41:52.898
No, no, no. And they took over
this bus, and it starred

41:53.065 --> 41:56.359
that actress with the name
like an animal. A cow.

41:56.526 --> 41:58.945
No, ox. No, it's not that.

41:59.112 --> 42:01.531
- Bullock.
- A Bull. Bullock. Sandra Bullock.

42:01.698 --> 42:03.784
And l can't remember the title
of the movie, but it's--

42:03.950 --> 42:06.370
l'm gonna look it up.
l'm gonna check her credits.

42:06.536 --> 42:08.872
- No, don't you have a report to finish?
- Yeah. l did it.

42:09.039 --> 42:10.916
Good for you. That's good.

42:11.083 --> 42:14.628
Wait. Stop typing. Wait.

42:15.295 --> 42:17.714
Has anyone seen Gibbs?

42:18.382 --> 42:20.717
lt takes guts to testify
against Carlos Mendez.

42:20.884 --> 42:22.135
Took more guts to fake her death

42:22.302 --> 42:24.930
and walk away from a husband
and son to protect them.

42:25.097 --> 42:27.391
Eighteen years is a long time
to seek revenge,

42:27.557 --> 42:30.727
- even for a Colombian drug lord.
- Jen, l gotta find her.

42:30.894 --> 42:32.646
No. You don't.

42:33.939 --> 42:36.733
You know, Kody Meyers
has had one hell of a day.

42:36.900 --> 42:38.985
lt's the least l can do for this kid.

42:51.081 --> 42:54.251
Good to see
l can still surprise you, Jethro.
