WEBVTT

01:49.984 --> 01:53.613
Nice moves, new kid.
What do you call that? The loser limbo?

01:55.323 --> 01:59.285
No, no, no, no. I think it's called
the I'm-trying-not-to-shit-my-pants dance.

02:00.286 --> 02:01.287
Good one, LaRusso!

02:17.762 --> 02:22.892


02:22.976 --> 02:24.310


02:28.273 --> 02:29.941
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

02:30.692 --> 02:33.611
Oh, hey, man.
Got in early to knock this sucker out.

02:34.737 --> 02:36.489
Smooth as a Smurf’s ass, right?

02:36.573 --> 02:38.825
That deck was
the perfect teachable moment.

02:38.908 --> 02:40.493
You just tanked my entire week!

02:40.577 --> 02:43.580
The kids know they’re here to learn
karate. You don’t need to trick 'em.

02:43.663 --> 02:47.083
I'm sorry. What was your lesson plan?
Line 'em up and throw forward strikes?

02:47.167 --> 02:50.712
I go by feel. Some days,
I'll toss them in a cement mixer.

02:50.795 --> 02:53.047
Other days, I'll find
a hornet’s nest for them to kick.

02:53.131 --> 02:54.507
Let’s not do this, okay?

02:55.133 --> 02:58.261
Our students want us to find a way
to work through our differences.

02:58.344 --> 03:01.639
I know you don’t want to join Miyagi-Do,
but at least respect it.

03:01.723 --> 03:03.391
Well, respect's a two-way street.

03:04.392 --> 03:06.019
You respect my style of karate?

03:08.563 --> 03:09.814
You gotta understand, man.

03:09.898 --> 03:12.692
I was taught
that karate is for defense only.

03:12.775 --> 03:14.944
It’s always gonna be tough
to respect Cobra Kai.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.988
-You mean Eagle Fang.
-Oh, come on, Johnny.

03:17.071 --> 03:19.199
Is there a difference?
You're still teaching aggression.

03:19.282 --> 03:21.367
Some kids need a little aggression.

03:23.536 --> 03:24.579
You know what?

03:25.413 --> 03:26.831
Let's give it a try.

03:26.915 --> 03:29.751
I teach you Miyagi-Do.
You teach me Eagle Fang.

03:31.461 --> 03:32.295
Deal.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.590
No, don't need to shake on it.

03:43.014 --> 03:44.224


03:48.603 --> 03:51.648
Hi, I'm Tory.
We waiting on anybody or is it just you?

03:51.731 --> 03:53.107


03:53.191 --> 03:54.317
It's just me.

03:55.318 --> 03:58.655
-Can I start you off with something?
-Actually, there's only one thing I need.

03:58.738 --> 04:01.991
That's for you
to stay the hell away from my daughter.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.955
-Wait, you're--
-Yes, I am.

04:07.956 --> 04:08.957
You came to my job?

04:09.040 --> 04:11.834
I tried calling your parents.
No call back. Big surprise.

04:11.918 --> 04:14.420
Should I have kicked in your front door?

04:14.963 --> 04:16.089
Is that more your speed?

04:17.131 --> 04:18.341
Every day in my house,

04:18.424 --> 04:20.718
there are little reminders
of the mess you made.

04:20.802 --> 04:24.430
I see my daughter
covering up her bruises and scars.

04:24.514 --> 04:26.891
The only reason
you aren’t behind bars right now

04:26.975 --> 04:30.019
is because she asked me
not to drag this ordeal out.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.063
So you can have your little tournament.

04:33.690 --> 04:37.360
But if you touch
one hair on her head before then,

04:37.443 --> 04:40.613
you'll be scrubbing toilets
in prison for the rest of your life.

04:41.406 --> 04:42.448
If you're lucky.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.410
Excuse me, miss?

04:45.493 --> 04:47.829
I think my soup is ready.
I see it on the counter.

04:47.912 --> 04:50.623
Yeah, just a minute.
I think you should leave.

04:50.707 --> 04:51.582
I will.

04:52.667 --> 04:55.753
I'm not here to cause a scene.
Just here to deliver a message.

04:56.546 --> 04:58.673
But I need to know
that you got that message.

05:00.842 --> 05:02.135
And what if I didn't?

05:06.097 --> 05:07.932
Well, then that would be a mistake.

05:09.183 --> 05:11.102
Is everything okay here, ma’am?

05:11.185 --> 05:12.478
I don't know. Is it?

05:13.062 --> 05:14.814
Miss? I don't want my soup to get cold.

05:14.897 --> 05:16.733
-Will you shut the hell up?
-Tory!

05:16.816 --> 05:19.235
That’s it. Put away your uniform.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.279
I’ve had enough of your attitude.
You’re fired.

05:24.782 --> 05:25.908
Yeah, thanks a lot.

05:28.828 --> 05:31.122
This place got a B
on the health inspection.

05:31.205 --> 05:33.416
They hide the sign so you can’t see it.

05:33.916 --> 05:36.502
And I saw one of the cooks
dip his balls in the miso.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.632
Uh, you know what? You can cancel my soup.

05:48.473 --> 05:49.307
Yes!

05:51.684 --> 05:52.935
Nice!

05:53.561 --> 05:54.479
Yes!

06:00.360 --> 06:01.611
Okay, let’s switch it up.

06:02.612 --> 06:05.990
New kid, get in there.
We'll get you some gym clothes next week.

06:06.074 --> 06:08.701
LaRusso, Thompson, you're in too.

06:09.410 --> 06:10.411
Let's go!

06:12.080 --> 06:13.498
All right. Sub out!

06:13.581 --> 06:14.791
'Sup, Slade?

06:16.584 --> 06:18.169
Ha. Look who it is.

06:18.753 --> 06:20.296
I'll cover the ballerina.

06:35.937 --> 06:38.231
Come on, LaRusso, you gotta stop that!

06:39.565 --> 06:40.775
I’m open!

06:44.946 --> 06:47.281
Hey! Break it up! New kid, get the ball!

06:48.908 --> 06:50.034
Oh shit!

06:50.535 --> 06:52.620
Dude, you just got facialed!

06:52.703 --> 06:54.288
Bust out some of that karate!

06:54.831 --> 06:56.082
I told you, okay?

06:56.165 --> 06:59.210
I-I-I can’t. Those moves cause,
like, permanent brain damage.

06:59.293 --> 07:01.838
Whatever, LaPusso.

07:05.216 --> 07:06.634
Sorry, man, it was an accident.

07:06.717 --> 07:08.010
Bullshit!

07:10.304 --> 07:12.890
Hey, come on.
Give the new kid a break, Ant.

07:12.974 --> 07:14.350
We've got a game to finish.

07:16.060 --> 07:17.895
Yeah. Yeah, all right, Lia.

07:20.148 --> 07:22.233
Just ignore them. Dope shirt, by the way.

07:23.109 --> 07:24.235
Thanks. I'm…

07:26.946 --> 07:27.780
Kenny.

07:34.871 --> 07:37.248
Remember, side, side.

07:38.749 --> 07:41.586
I could have this finished
in two minutes with a paint sprayer.

07:41.669 --> 07:43.754
Then you'll be missing
the point of the lesson.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.467
You know,
you can’t just layer paint on shit.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.760
You need a heat gun
to get down to the base.

07:49.844 --> 07:51.262
Maybe a right angle scraper.

07:51.345 --> 07:52.430
That’s not the point.

07:52.930 --> 07:55.099
If you wanna learn
how to fight defensively,

07:55.641 --> 07:56.976
you gotta change your instincts.

07:57.059 --> 07:59.854
Well, my instincts say
this is a waste of time.

08:03.024 --> 08:05.026
That's quality.

08:07.111 --> 08:09.238
You missed a spot. Over there.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.324
You know what? Screw this.

08:11.908 --> 08:14.785
What? You quitting already? That's it?

08:16.204 --> 08:18.039
Maybe you can do this, but I can’t.

08:18.623 --> 08:19.790
Defense is boring.

08:19.874 --> 08:22.335
Offense will always be more badass.

08:24.295 --> 08:26.130
Fruit in your beer? Figures.

08:27.507 --> 08:28.758
Hi-yah!

08:29.884 --> 08:31.052
Holy shit.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.471
How the hell did you do that?

08:34.138 --> 08:36.307
Miyagi-Do may seem boring,

08:37.225 --> 08:40.102
but don't forget it saved your ass
a few weeks ago from Kreese.

08:40.978 --> 08:42.563
And that wasn't the first time.

08:43.397 --> 08:45.858
-Come on, who's the loser now?
-You suck!

08:50.947 --> 08:51.822
Hi-yah!

08:52.907 --> 08:55.159
Nobody was more badass than Mr. Miyagi.

09:13.719 --> 09:16.264
Remember, side, side.

09:17.932 --> 09:20.101
<i>There’s a reason</i>
<i>Miyagi-Do is difficult to learn.</i>

09:25.481 --> 09:28.776
These blocks are incredibly precise.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.530
Each one is designed
to overcome a specific attack.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.035
Show me wax on, wax off.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.377
The more you learn Miyagi-Do,

09:46.919 --> 09:48.504
the tougher you are to defeat.

09:49.130 --> 09:51.674
Except for one tiny flaw.

09:54.385 --> 09:57.680
Their entire style is reactive,

09:58.723 --> 10:01.392
which means
all their moves are counter moves.

10:02.476 --> 10:04.562
That means that we are in control.

10:05.896 --> 10:08.232
And we can use that to set traps.

10:11.944 --> 10:13.362
Show me paint the fence.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.578
Sorry. Just part of the lesson.

10:24.790 --> 10:25.708
Enough!

10:26.709 --> 10:27.918
Nichols, in my office.

10:29.503 --> 10:30.546
Continue the lesson.

10:38.596 --> 10:39.430
What is it?

10:39.972 --> 10:41.682
Something happen with your mother?

10:43.017 --> 10:45.186
No. It's nothing.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.690
I lost my job, okay?

10:51.484 --> 10:55.154
And it's not so easy looking
for another one when you're on probation.

10:56.739 --> 10:58.324
Do you feel sorry for yourself?

11:02.119 --> 11:02.953
Uh…

11:03.037 --> 11:04.747
When something bad happens,

11:05.373 --> 11:06.624
you have two choices.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.544
You let it tear you down
or you let it build you up.

11:12.713 --> 11:14.674
Sometimes a step backwards…

11:17.385 --> 11:18.803
opens a new path forward.

11:20.388 --> 11:21.222
Now,

11:22.390 --> 11:23.474
what happened?

11:45.621 --> 11:47.957
-Hey, Dad.
-Hey, champ. You just get home?

11:48.040 --> 11:50.251
-Did I get the time difference right?
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

11:50.334 --> 11:52.586
How was your first day?
Make any new friends?

11:54.088 --> 11:55.464
I'm still getting to know everyone.

11:55.965 --> 11:58.551
<i>It's not easy to switch</i>
<i>to a new school</i> <i>mid-year.</i>

11:58.634 --> 12:01.387
But if you do things the right way,
you'll see results.

12:02.513 --> 12:03.597
I will.

12:04.849 --> 12:05.725
My boy.

12:05.808 --> 12:06.851
<i>How's Mom doing?</i>

12:07.893 --> 12:09.228
She's at the office a lot.

12:10.521 --> 12:11.605
Yeah, she works hard.

12:12.398 --> 12:13.399
She needs you now.

12:14.191 --> 12:15.735
She's had a tough time since…

12:18.696 --> 12:19.905
what happened to your brother.

12:21.198 --> 12:23.701
-I know.
<i>You're the man of the house now.</i>

12:23.784 --> 12:25.703
You shouldn't have to be, but you are.

12:26.537 --> 12:27.913
Can you rise to that for me?

12:29.999 --> 12:31.959
-Yeah, Dad.
-<i>I love you, champ.</i>

12:32.626 --> 12:33.461
<i>I miss you.</i>

12:34.295 --> 12:35.129
Love you too.

12:36.380 --> 12:37.214
Bye.

12:52.271 --> 12:53.606


12:58.235 --> 12:59.403
Dope shirt, by the way.

13:11.582 --> 13:12.541
One day,

13:13.167 --> 13:16.879
over 400 years ago, there was a fisherman.

13:17.880 --> 13:20.090
His name was Shimpo Sensei.

13:20.174 --> 13:22.593
Ambition without knowledge

13:23.511 --> 13:25.346
is like a boat on dry land.

13:27.181 --> 13:28.015
That's it.

13:29.099 --> 13:30.184
Big circles.

13:31.185 --> 13:32.228
Right circle.

13:33.229 --> 13:34.188
Left circle.

13:35.022 --> 13:38.108
Walk on the left side of the road, safe.

13:38.192 --> 13:41.153
Walk on the right side of the road, safe.

13:41.237 --> 13:42.446
Walk down the middle…

13:44.490 --> 13:45.908
Get squished like grape.

13:47.409 --> 13:48.619
Center yourself, Johnny.

13:51.455 --> 13:52.456
Look inward.

13:53.499 --> 13:54.834
Find your balance.

13:56.836 --> 13:57.753
There you go.

13:58.337 --> 13:59.755
Now show me the moves.

14:05.052 --> 14:05.886
That's it.

14:06.679 --> 14:07.680
Balance good.

14:09.431 --> 14:11.600
-Karate good. Everything--

14:16.397 --> 14:17.690
This thing isn't even level.

14:17.773 --> 14:20.693
Or maybe you have
a little imbalance inside of you.

14:20.776 --> 14:23.320
I still don't see me
using any of this in a real fight.

14:23.404 --> 14:26.574
I’ve been trying to tell you,
Miyagi-Do is not about fighting.

14:26.657 --> 14:29.910
You know what Mr. Miyagi said
was the best defense in all of karate?

14:29.994 --> 14:32.121
High outside block against an ax kick?

14:32.788 --> 14:35.457
The best defense is "no be there."

14:37.001 --> 14:38.168
You mean don't be there?

14:38.252 --> 14:41.005
The guy teaches you centuries
of his ancient family karate,

14:41.088 --> 14:42.423
you can’t help him with  English?

14:42.506 --> 14:44.216
Don’t even go there with me, Johnny.

14:44.300 --> 14:47.636
Are we done, or do I have to sit here and
freeze my nuts off to find inner peace?

14:48.220 --> 14:49.513
No. We're done.

14:50.681 --> 14:52.349
You got a taste of Miyagi-Do.

14:52.433 --> 14:53.601
That was the goal.

14:54.101 --> 14:54.935
Good.

14:55.436 --> 14:56.312
Well, get ready.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.856
'Cause tomorrow,
you'll learn real man karate.

14:59.356 --> 15:00.566
Oh, I can't wait

15:00.649 --> 15:03.819
to hear all about
the illustrious history and wise teachings

15:04.486 --> 15:05.613
of the Eagle Fang.

15:07.948 --> 15:09.909


15:10.534 --> 15:11.368
Check this out.

15:13.037 --> 15:14.580


15:14.663 --> 15:15.539
Mm.

15:26.967 --> 15:27.801
Wow.

15:28.510 --> 15:29.345
She's cool.

15:35.017 --> 15:36.393
What else do I do for fun?

15:38.354 --> 15:39.188
Ooh.

15:39.855 --> 15:41.732
Draw anime.

15:42.983 --> 15:44.443
Listen to music.

15:46.946 --> 15:50.199
Every now and then,
some <i>Dungeon Lord </i>cosplay.

15:50.699 --> 15:51.533


15:53.118 --> 15:54.870
Don't tell anyone I told you that.

15:56.038 --> 15:57.122
Send.

16:02.002 --> 16:06.173
Don't worry. Your secret is safe with me.

16:07.967 --> 16:08.926
Oh my God.

16:09.009 --> 16:11.387
-He cosplays this shit?

16:11.470 --> 16:13.555
Ask him who's his favorite character.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.768
Dr. Scribblebottoms.

16:20.312 --> 16:21.814
Dr. Scribblebottoms?

16:21.897 --> 16:24.108
Oh my God.
That is, like, the lamest character.

16:24.191 --> 16:27.736
He’s like this stupid chipmunk
with, with big ears and a lab coat

16:27.820 --> 16:29.947
who, like,
he mixes, like, health potions and--

16:30.030 --> 16:31.323
How do you know so much?

16:33.158 --> 16:36.996
I just, you know, uh, overheard
some, some nerds talking about it.

16:38.872 --> 16:43.335
I got an idea. Tell him you, I mean Lia,

16:43.419 --> 16:47.631
and a bunch of other <i>Dungeon Lord </i>losers
are meeting at Balboa Park tomorrow night.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.550
Tell him to cosplay as Mr…

16:50.592 --> 16:52.011
Scrapalas or whatever.

16:52.094 --> 16:53.971
Uh, why? Why? What's the plan?

16:54.972 --> 16:55.806
Just do it!

16:55.889 --> 16:57.349
Man, just do it.

17:00.227 --> 17:01.186
Balboa Park.

17:08.360 --> 17:09.194
Yeah.

17:11.196 --> 17:12.322
Where do you wanna go?

17:14.867 --> 17:16.410
He has no clue.

17:16.493 --> 17:17.995
This is gonna be great.

17:27.629 --> 17:29.965
Excuse me. Do you have
any Klare Melk Truffle Gouda?

17:30.549 --> 17:31.383
Let me go look.

17:33.719 --> 17:34.928
Oh. Shit.

17:45.272 --> 17:46.482
Butterfingers, huh?

17:50.527 --> 17:53.447
-What are you doing here?
-Well, it’s honeycrisp season.

17:53.530 --> 17:56.033
This store has
the best produce in the Valley.

17:56.116 --> 17:59.161
Don’t you need to be
a legally-mandated distance away from me?

17:59.244 --> 18:00.370
Other way around.

18:01.789 --> 18:04.750
Technically, you’re the one in violation.

18:08.629 --> 18:11.757
I know about the deal you struck
with my husband and Johnny,

18:12.341 --> 18:15.761
and I just want you to know
that whatever happens at that tournament,

18:16.512 --> 18:18.597
I will make sure you lose.

18:21.016 --> 18:23.102
Is that why you’re sabotaging my student?

18:23.185 --> 18:24.937
I wasn’t trying to get Tory fired.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.482
But that girl's asking for trouble.
She broke into my house.

18:28.565 --> 18:29.858
Attacked my daughter.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.569
Sam’s gonna have scars
for the rest of her life.

18:33.070 --> 18:35.197
I respect you defending your daughter.

18:36.156 --> 18:38.033
I think that's what all mothers should do.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.245
Unfortunately, Tory doesn't have a mother.

18:42.204 --> 18:44.331
Or one that's healthy enough
to defend her.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.126
That girl has to pay the bills.

18:48.252 --> 18:49.878
Put food on the table.

18:50.462 --> 18:51.547
All by herself.

18:55.425 --> 18:57.636
-I didn't know that.
-Well, now you know.

18:58.220 --> 19:00.347
So you might want to leave the girl alone.

19:01.890 --> 19:03.725
Or deal with the consequences.

19:04.810 --> 19:05.811
Mrs. LaRusso.

19:06.603 --> 19:09.356
Found that Gouda.
Last one too. Must be your lucky day.

19:09.439 --> 19:10.440
Oh, thank you.

19:12.025 --> 19:12.860
Remember,

19:14.361 --> 19:16.321
not all kids are as lucky as yours.

19:23.453 --> 19:24.288
Sweet.

19:33.797 --> 19:37.634
Come on, Johnny, time to wake up.
I'm ready for Eagle Fang training.

19:38.677 --> 19:41.722
That sounded as ridiculous out loud
as I thought it would.

19:43.974 --> 19:45.350
You sure you're ready?

19:45.434 --> 19:46.810
As I'll ever be.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.063
The hell. Wha--

19:50.689 --> 19:53.483
Where the hell did you take me?
An abandoned factory?

19:53.984 --> 19:56.820
This is how psychos in horror movies act,
you know that?

19:56.904 --> 19:59.406
You wanna circle around things
your whole life?

19:59.990 --> 20:02.242
Wait for problems
to show up at your doorstep?

20:03.660 --> 20:05.162
That's not what an eagle does.

20:07.748 --> 20:10.709
Here, at Eagle Fang,

20:10.792 --> 20:12.127
we do not follow.

20:13.378 --> 20:14.213
We attack.

20:15.172 --> 20:16.048
We lead.

20:17.174 --> 20:19.092
We grow into what we were meant to be.

20:19.593 --> 20:21.386
And what were we meant to be, Johnny?

20:22.554 --> 20:23.430
Men.

20:28.602 --> 20:30.646
An eagle embraces the pain!

20:30.729 --> 20:33.732
<i>All your life, the world’s been trying</i>
<i>to make you less of a man.</i>

20:33.815 --> 20:36.235
<i>Light beer? Veggie burgers?</i>

20:36.318 --> 20:38.445
<i>Automatic transmissions?</i>

20:38.528 --> 20:40.614
Might as well
let another dude bang your chick!

20:42.074 --> 20:45.285
You realize the coals are supposed
to be shoveled into the forge?

20:45.369 --> 20:46.536
Don't question me, Newark!

20:47.246 --> 20:48.121
Keep shoveling!

20:52.292 --> 20:53.210
Let's go, LaRusso.

20:53.293 --> 20:54.127
Start climbin'.

20:55.587 --> 20:58.006
Toughen up those soft hands. Push!

21:00.884 --> 21:03.762
Can’t wait to get hit.
Gotta strike before the hit gets to you.

21:04.763 --> 21:06.848
-Isn't this a blocking exercise?
-No!

21:08.433 --> 21:10.936
When you think you should be defending,
you should be offending!

21:12.104 --> 21:14.481
The human response to danger
is fight or flight,

21:14.564 --> 21:17.567
but an eagle’s response
is fight <i>and </i>flight.

21:21.613 --> 21:23.657
Move it! Be aggressive! Attack!

21:24.283 --> 21:25.909
-That's it! Attack!

21:27.160 --> 21:28.537
Good, LaRusso! Good!

21:28.620 --> 21:31.415
Manliness is next to godliness.
You got this.

21:31.498 --> 21:32.958
Find your limit and soar past it.

21:33.667 --> 21:35.752
-What does this have to do with--
-Quiet!

21:35.836 --> 21:39.631
Keep climbing, LaRusso!
You got this! Focus. Fight!

21:42.676 --> 21:45.178
Put your fangs in those balls. That's it.

21:48.056 --> 21:49.349
-That's it!
-Come on!

21:49.433 --> 21:52.436
-Let's go, LaRusso! You got this! Yeah!
-Yeah!

21:55.439 --> 21:57.107
That's what I'm talking about!

21:57.190 --> 21:59.818
Soar like an eagle, baby!
Yeah, keep going!

22:01.361 --> 22:03.780
Yeah!

22:15.042 --> 22:15.917
Where is she?

22:21.340 --> 22:22.382
Oh my God!

22:22.883 --> 22:23.842
Look at him.

22:25.886 --> 22:29.681
Come on, look at him!
Look at this loser. Oh, man.

22:29.765 --> 22:32.684
Oh, I think he's wearing glitter.
Get a close-up of that.

22:32.768 --> 22:33.810
<i>Hey.</i>
<i>-Stop it.</i>

22:33.894 --> 22:35.020
You gotta post that.

22:35.103 --> 22:36.313
No, don't! Don't!

22:36.396 --> 22:40.901
-Oh shit! He just broke your phone.
-You gonna let him get away with that?

22:40.984 --> 22:44.696
I wasn't trying to break it.
You guys were being assholes.

22:46.740 --> 22:48.158
What did you just call us?

22:59.503 --> 23:00.379
Pick him up.

23:04.674 --> 23:06.968
All right, LaRusso. Let's see your moves.

23:07.469 --> 23:09.930
Yeah! Bust out some of that Miyagi shit.

23:10.013 --> 23:11.807
-I, uh…
-Come on, LaPusso!

23:12.307 --> 23:14.142
-Don't call me that.
-Then hit him!

23:15.394 --> 23:16.269
Come on!

23:16.770 --> 23:17.646
Do it!

23:42.671 --> 23:43.588
It's locked.

23:44.214 --> 23:46.049
Hey, there's a hole!

23:46.591 --> 23:47.509
Go, go, go!

23:56.143 --> 23:57.185
Where'd he go?

23:57.269 --> 23:58.937
I don't know. Come on, this way!

24:21.084 --> 24:22.419
So what are we doing here?

24:22.919 --> 24:25.839
After a hard day of honest work,
we're crushing beers,

24:25.922 --> 24:27.883
watching guys
beat the hell out of each other.

24:27.966 --> 24:30.343
Does this mean
I've passed my Eagle Fang training?

24:30.844 --> 24:32.179
I didn’t say training was over.

24:34.639 --> 24:36.016
What are you talking about?

24:36.099 --> 24:38.602
Look, you're tougher than a prima donna,
I'll give you that.

24:39.102 --> 24:41.354
But sometimes
you gotta show your toughness.

24:42.105 --> 24:43.148
Look at those guys.

24:44.149 --> 24:45.609
Think they play by the rules?

24:46.776 --> 24:49.112
The only rule in this league
is intimidation.

24:50.238 --> 24:52.532
That's why striking first is so important.

24:54.534 --> 24:55.911
-Ooh!

24:57.704 --> 25:01.249
That guy's a rat.
That's spearing. At least a double minor.

25:01.333 --> 25:02.792
Hey, Ref! Spearing!

25:02.876 --> 25:04.336
Double minor.

25:05.462 --> 25:07.214
Oh, that's bullshit. Come on!

25:09.424 --> 25:10.467
Oh, he looks pissed.

25:13.386 --> 25:16.264
-What the hell, dick?
-Hey, he's the one that called it.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.266
Your boyfriend do all your talking?

25:18.350 --> 25:20.519
No, I'm just explaining the rules to him.

25:20.602 --> 25:23.021
Oh yeah? Come explain it to me down here!

25:23.104 --> 25:25.315
I know what you’re trying to do,
all right?

25:25.398 --> 25:27.526
I’m not gonna get in a fight
with that guy.

25:28.693 --> 25:31.446
He says you're a pussy
and he can kick your ass any day.

25:31.530 --> 25:35.617
-Hey, enough! All right? Cut it out!
-Oh, come on down, Sally. Let's go.

25:35.700 --> 25:36.993
I… I didn't say that.

25:37.619 --> 25:41.665
I need to apologize for my friend here.
He's a little… unstable.

25:41.748 --> 25:43.458
We're working through it. Sorry.

25:46.711 --> 25:50.382
You see what I just did there?
That's called de-escalation.

25:51.424 --> 25:53.093
You should try it sometime.

25:57.639 --> 25:59.849
You know what? I actually had fun.

26:00.392 --> 26:02.477
Not even you
could ruin hockey for me, Johnny.

26:02.561 --> 26:03.603
Ah, you see?

26:03.687 --> 26:05.772
And did they win
'cause they played better defense?

26:06.273 --> 26:08.817
No, they won 'cause they beat
the crap out of the other team.

26:08.900 --> 26:10.652
I’m not gonna change my stripes, okay?

26:10.735 --> 26:12.904
I just now have
a little better understanding

26:12.988 --> 26:14.906
of what goes on in that head of yours.

26:14.990 --> 26:17.117
So you're saying you respect Eagle Fang?

26:17.200 --> 26:19.953
Yes. The way
I respect a madman with a nuke.

26:21.121 --> 26:22.247
I'll take it.

26:22.330 --> 26:23.456
Hey, shithead!

26:23.540 --> 26:26.835
Hey, good game, guys.
No hard feelings, right?

26:26.918 --> 26:29.087
Because of you,
I spent half the game in the box.

26:29.170 --> 26:31.673
Yeah, but you still eked out a win.
It was great.

26:31.756 --> 26:35.510
So you can kick my ass
any day of the week. Is that right?

26:35.594 --> 26:37.178
No, I didn't say that. He--

26:38.972 --> 26:40.974
Looks like your lover boy bailed on you.

26:41.766 --> 26:43.935
Wait, wait, wait. You know who this is?

26:44.019 --> 26:45.395
It’s LaRusso Auto.

26:45.979 --> 26:47.647
The chopping prices guy from TV?

26:48.231 --> 26:50.400
He’s got that smoking hot brunette
running the place.

26:51.526 --> 26:53.778
Easy guys. That's my wife.

26:53.862 --> 26:54.696
Oh.

26:55.780 --> 26:59.242
-Maybe I'll take her for a test drive.
-I'll ride shotgun.

26:59.951 --> 27:03.371
-I got the backseat to myself.

28:01.262 --> 28:02.681
Kick ass!

28:02.764 --> 28:05.308
Nice work, LaRusso.
Way to assert your dominance.

28:05.392 --> 28:06.810
Where the hell were you?

28:07.602 --> 28:08.520
No be there.

28:21.783 --> 28:26.037
And make sure that Louis doesn't
go anywhere near the Doyona reps.

28:26.121 --> 28:28.331
Just lock him
in a supply closet or something.

28:28.415 --> 28:30.834
I'll put a cannoli under a giant net.
He'll go for it.

28:30.917 --> 28:31.876
I'm serious.

28:32.585 --> 28:34.003
So am I. Do I not look serious?

28:37.799 --> 28:39.426
-Oh shit.
-Shit? What?

28:39.509 --> 28:40.885
What's shit? Why are we saying--

28:42.887 --> 28:44.013
Shit.

28:44.097 --> 28:47.058
You think this makes up for it?
Leaving this at my doorstep?

28:47.684 --> 28:49.519
-I don't need your sympathy.

28:50.103 --> 28:52.480
I just wanted to make sure
you had enough food.

28:52.564 --> 28:55.608
-Yeah, I feed my family.
-Look, why don't we go talk in my office?

28:55.692 --> 28:56.693
We're talking here.

28:56.776 --> 29:00.196
Okay, maybe we just lower our volume? Huh?

29:00.280 --> 29:03.575
Gandhi once said that nobody
can hurt me without my permission.

29:04.075 --> 29:07.662
Take one more step towards me
and I'll snap you in half like a pencil.

29:08.663 --> 29:10.957
Why do I step
into these karate situations?

29:12.083 --> 29:13.501
Look, Tory,

29:13.585 --> 29:15.712
I just want all of this to be over.

29:15.795 --> 29:18.631
Yeah, well, don't worry.
It'll all be over soon.

29:19.924 --> 29:23.636
When I humiliate your daughter
at the All Valley in front of everyone.

29:23.720 --> 29:25.555
Thanks for lighting a fire under me.

29:26.055 --> 29:27.223
I needed that.

29:30.185 --> 29:31.561
-What have I done?
-Hey.

29:31.644 --> 29:34.105
Should I start
wearing protective gear to work?

29:34.189 --> 29:36.274
And follow-up,
should I be calling the police?

29:36.357 --> 29:37.233
No.

29:38.568 --> 29:40.236
And not a word of this to Daniel.

29:42.906 --> 29:45.158
<i>Ever since I started</i>
<i>this new school,</i>

29:46.284 --> 29:47.744
<i>my life has been miserable.</i>

29:51.581 --> 29:52.499
<i>They chase me.</i>

29:53.500 --> 29:54.375
<i>Beat me up.</i>

29:54.959 --> 29:56.419
<i>Hey.</i>
<i>-Stop it.</i>

29:59.547 --> 30:00.965
<i>It's not gonna stop.</i>

30:07.597 --> 30:09.516
<i>I don't know how I'm gonna keep going.</i>

30:11.476 --> 30:12.685
<i>I don't feel safe.</i>

30:17.774 --> 30:19.359
One of them even knows karate.

30:23.446 --> 30:24.447
Karate, huh?

30:26.449 --> 30:27.492
What's so funny?

30:28.243 --> 30:30.370
Hey, don't worry about it, little bro.

30:32.163 --> 30:33.665
I know a guy who can help.
