Get back on that line!
Hold it.

01:28.487 --> 01:32.123
Wait a second, Archie.
Hold on a second.

01:32.191 --> 01:35.126
This isn't the dingbat.
It's me, the meathead.

01:37.029 --> 01:39.363
Yeah--
no, she's right here.

01:39.431 --> 01:42.000
Hold on.
Hello, Archie.

01:42.068 --> 01:44.002
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

01:44.070 --> 01:48.306
After I answered the telephone,
I had to answer the teakettle.

01:48.373 --> 01:50.809
Oh, I don't mean
the kettle was talking.

01:50.876 --> 01:52.677
It was whistling and--

01:52.745 --> 01:54.846
yeah, Archie,
I'm listening.

01:58.050 --> 02:00.985
Hi, Michael.
Did you have a nice day?
Oh, yeah.

02:01.053 --> 02:02.921
What's the matter
with ma?

02:02.988 --> 02:05.757
I think Archie
put her on stifle.

02:08.994 --> 02:11.596
Yeah, it'll be all ready,
Archie.

02:11.663 --> 02:13.698
I can hardly wait.

02:13.766 --> 02:15.299
Yeah, bye.

02:15.367 --> 02:19.303
Gloria, help me get the food.
Your father'll be here
in two seconds.

02:19.371 --> 02:21.472
Two seconds?
Where was he calling from?

02:21.540 --> 02:25.710
From the liquor store.
He's bringing a bottle of wine
home for dinner.

02:25.778 --> 02:27.612
Archie, wine?
Yeah.

02:27.679 --> 02:30.148
Something important
is going on...

02:30.216 --> 02:34.219
'Cause he asked
his shop steward
to drop in after dinner.

02:34.286 --> 02:36.921
I don't understand, ma.
What's happening?

02:36.989 --> 02:39.257
That's right.
You weren't here.

02:39.324 --> 02:41.760
But your father called me
right after lunch...

02:41.827 --> 02:46.664
And he said he had
a great big surprise for us.

02:46.732 --> 02:50.268
Oh, he sounded so happy
and excited.

02:50.335 --> 02:53.171
What's the surprise, ma?

02:53.239 --> 02:56.875
I don't know,
but this is what he said--

02:56.942 --> 03:01.512
he wanted dinner served,
eaten and cleared away
by 5:30 sharp,

03:01.580 --> 03:03.882
after which
he don't want no noise...

03:03.949 --> 03:06.951
And he don't want Gloria
and the meathead--

03:10.622 --> 03:16.027
I'm sorry, Mike.
He don't want Gloria and Mike
to go out neither.

03:16.095 --> 03:19.297
- What do you think it is?
- Well, I don't know.

03:19.364 --> 03:23.701
The last time he brought home
a surprise, it was that--

03:25.504 --> 03:30.008
you know that parrot he bought
off this marine at kelcy's bar?

03:30.075 --> 03:32.576
You're kidding.
Archie surprised you
with a parrot?

03:32.644 --> 03:34.545
Yeah,
he surprised himself.

03:34.613 --> 03:39.150
He broke out in hives
as big as 50-cent pieces.

03:39.218 --> 03:42.720
And he couldn't stop sneezing.
He was allergic
to the parrot?

03:42.788 --> 03:47.692
Yeah, he kept on sneezing--
sometimes 20 times in a row.

03:47.759 --> 03:53.397
And every time he sneezed
the parrot went,
"gesundheit! Gesundheit!"

03:55.067 --> 03:57.936
It made Archie very mad.

03:58.003 --> 04:00.038
Good evening, all,

04:00.105 --> 04:02.140
and a wonderful evening
it's gonna be.

04:02.208 --> 04:04.508
Hello, Archie.

04:04.576 --> 04:06.277
Everything is ready,

04:06.345 --> 04:08.412
just the way you ordered it.

04:08.480 --> 04:11.615
That's terrific, Edith.
You done a terrific job.
Everything is terrific.

04:11.683 --> 04:14.319
Good evening, Gloria,
and good evening, Michael.

04:14.386 --> 04:16.454
"Good evening, Michael"?

04:16.521 --> 04:18.957
Edith, bring
them wine glasses
over here.

04:19.024 --> 04:21.226
Ain't this exciting!

04:21.293 --> 04:24.162
Why, we haven't
used these glasses...

04:24.230 --> 04:27.665
Since we got 'em
from the quaker oats people.

04:30.236 --> 04:32.303
Well, it's about time
we used 'em.

04:32.371 --> 04:36.140
This is a special occasion,
and I bought
a very special wine.

04:36.208 --> 04:39.143
Yeah, the screw-on cap
has a great bouquet.

04:42.281 --> 04:44.548
Kinda nice, huh?

<i>There we are.</i>
<i>Oh, my. Red wine.</i>

04:48.120 --> 04:50.054

it's manischewitz.

04:50.122 --> 04:51.689
No, Edith.

04:51.757 --> 04:54.325
I buy strictly American.

04:57.396 --> 05:00.664
Don't nobody say nothing
till I make the toast.

05:00.732 --> 05:02.300
What are we drinking to?

05:02.368 --> 05:04.168
We are drinking to...

05:04.236 --> 05:06.170
The man in the street.

05:06.238 --> 05:09.107
What's
"the man in the street"?

05:09.174 --> 05:11.442
You'll find out
all in good time.

05:11.510 --> 05:14.112

let's get over there
and eat our dinner.

05:14.179 --> 05:17.181

a swell bottle of wine.

Nothing you say to me
is gonna make me mad tonight,

05:32.131 --> 05:35.066
meathead though you are.

05:35.134 --> 05:39.304
We had our differences
in the past,
a little tiff here and there.

05:39.371 --> 05:41.639
We don't see nose to nose
on everything.

05:41.706 --> 05:44.909
But tonight I'm gonna show you
the way a real American feels...

05:44.977 --> 05:47.445
About living in
the good old U.S. of a.

05:47.512 --> 05:50.448
Now get over here and let's eat,
'cause we only got 15 minutes.

05:50.515 --> 05:52.783
When you gonna tell us
the surprise?

05:52.851 --> 05:54.785
Did you get promoted,
Archie?

05:54.853 --> 05:57.021
- You won the lottery.
<i>- Did you get a raise?</i>

05:57.089 --> 05:58.923
No, none of them things.

05:58.991 --> 06:01.859
Oh, I know.
I bet they gave him
his own key to the men's room.

06:01.927 --> 06:05.096
Michael.
Sorry.
The wine went to my head.

06:07.299 --> 06:10.234
I ain't surprised.
You ain't got nothin' else
up there.

06:13.439 --> 06:16.207
Well, give us a hint,
Archie.

06:16.275 --> 06:19.610
Is the surprise
animal, vegetable or mineral?

06:19.678 --> 06:21.645
Neither one, Edith.
It's human.

06:22.781 --> 06:24.482
If it's human,
it's animal.

06:24.549 --> 06:27.485
We ain't discussin' you,
meathead,
we're discussin' me.

06:27.552 --> 06:29.620
Ha!

06:29.688 --> 06:32.023
Come on, daddy.
We give up.

06:32.091 --> 06:34.558
All right,
I won't keep youse
in suspense no longer.

06:34.626 --> 06:38.729
Today at lunchtime
I went around to the bench
in back of the loading bay...

06:38.797 --> 06:42.433
And I was sittin' there
with some of the guys--
stretch Cunningham and them.

06:42.501 --> 06:45.436
I was just about to
open up my lunch box--

06:45.504 --> 06:48.439
by the way,
there wasn't no twinkie in
with the sandwiches today.

06:51.610 --> 06:53.211
I'm sorry, Archie.

06:53.278 --> 06:56.981
Forget it, Edith.
I'm in a good mood tonight.

06:57.049 --> 07:01.552
All of the sudden up comes
this great big CBS truck...

07:01.620 --> 07:05.156
Loaded with
equipment and lights,
guys with cameras.

07:05.224 --> 07:10.161
One guy shoves a microphone
out to stretch
and asks him a question.

07:10.229 --> 07:12.696
- What did he say?
- Who, stretch? Nothin'.

07:12.764 --> 07:14.698
You know him.
He's always clowning around.

07:14.766 --> 07:18.236
He tries to eat the microphone
like it was a popsicle, see.

07:18.303 --> 07:21.772
So the guy
comes up to me and says,
"you're a workin' man.

07:21.840 --> 07:27.412
We'd like to have your
opinion on president Nixon's
new economic phase."

07:27.479 --> 07:30.415
So tonight,
on the Walter cronkite news,

07:30.482 --> 07:32.517
guess who youse
is gonna see there.

07:34.119 --> 07:37.055
Just think of somebody
you all know and love.

07:38.757 --> 07:40.691
Marcus welby!

07:49.901 --> 07:53.337
Oh, geez, when are they
gonna come out with a pill
for dingbat?

07:55.207 --> 07:57.908
No, Edith, me!
I'm gonna be
on the cronkite news.

07:57.976 --> 07:59.710
Oh, Archie!

07:59.778 --> 08:02.547
Really? That's fantastic!
Daddy's gonna be
on the news!

08:02.614 --> 08:04.815
Me. Yours truly.

08:04.883 --> 08:08.119
For once, the great
American public is gonna
get to hear the opinions...

08:08.187 --> 08:09.954
Of the real common man.

08:10.021 --> 08:12.723
I can't argue
with that statement.

08:14.460 --> 08:19.464
Oh, Archie, it's like having
a tv star in the family.

08:19.531 --> 08:22.366
Ain't it?
You could say that,
Edith.

08:22.434 --> 08:25.903
- What'd you say
for the cameras?
- Oh, a lot of things.

08:25.971 --> 08:28.906
Just on the sperm
of the moment.

08:30.509 --> 08:33.510
What did you tell them
about Mr. Nixon?

08:33.578 --> 08:35.779
I hope you told them
the truth.
<i>[ Archie ]</i>
<i>Certainly.</i>

08:35.847 --> 08:38.549
Yeah, that Nixon's surrendering
the country to big business.

08:38.616 --> 08:41.652
No, I didn't tell him that
'cause that ain't the truth.

08:41.720 --> 08:45.823
I said Mr. Nixon's
preserving the spirit of
competition and free enterprise.

08:45.890 --> 08:48.626
Oh, really?
How's he doing that, arch?

08:48.693 --> 08:53.931
By keeping out jap merchandise
and forcing the public
to buy American.

08:53.999 --> 08:56.867
The way Nixon works it,
nobody can afford
to buy anything.

08:56.935 --> 09:01.038
What are you talking about?
Ain't he took the exercise tax
off of cars?

09:02.674 --> 09:05.409
That's right, arch.
I'd forgotten about that.

09:05.477 --> 09:07.711
How many cars
are you gonna buy?

09:07.779 --> 09:10.481
Ain't he tryin'
to keep wages and prices
from going up?

09:10.549 --> 09:13.584
Yeah, but not profits
and interest rates.
Don't you see?

09:13.652 --> 09:16.987
Nixon's controlling
the little man and letting
the big guys run wild.

09:17.055 --> 09:20.458
He's a big guy.
He didn't give himself a raise.
He froze himself too, didn't he?

09:20.526 --> 09:24.895
Oh, yeah, he's freezing
at $200,000 a year
in three houses.

09:24.963 --> 09:26.997
He knows what's best
for the country.

09:27.065 --> 09:29.200
That's why he's
going to China, Russia.

09:29.268 --> 09:32.670
If he knows what's
best for the country,
why is he coming back?

09:38.109 --> 09:39.810
'Cause he is my president...

09:39.878 --> 09:41.979
And I want him back!

09:46.084 --> 09:48.018
That's what I told
that CBS guy.

09:48.086 --> 09:52.590
I said, "listen,
there's millions of guys like me
out there in the country...

09:52.658 --> 09:55.426
"That really believe
in president Nixon.

09:55.494 --> 09:57.428
God believes in him too."

10:00.432 --> 10:02.966
You said that on television?

10:03.034 --> 10:04.569
God believes in Nixon?

10:04.636 --> 10:10.040
Certainly! Billy Graham
plays golf with him, don't he?

10:10.108 --> 10:14.245
- What does that mean?
- That means God
believes in Nixon.

10:14.313 --> 10:18.048
Wait a second.
Are you saying that Nixon rules
because of divine right?

10:18.116 --> 10:21.719
It's a damn sight better
than your divine left.

10:23.822 --> 10:25.756
What other gems
did you come up with?

10:25.824 --> 10:28.392
You'll just have to
wait and see, Sonny boy.

10:28.460 --> 10:32.062
You'll have to wait and see
and hear along with
the rest of the nation.

10:32.130 --> 10:36.166
I'm gonna turn this on
and get it ready. Edith,
what channel is cronkite on?

10:36.235 --> 10:38.102
Channel 2, Archie.

10:38.169 --> 10:43.107
The one we don't watch
because you always say
Walter cronkite is a communist.

10:48.847 --> 10:52.683
I never said that, Edith.
The man ain't all red.

10:55.019 --> 10:57.455
What's the matter?
There ain't nothin' coming on.

10:57.522 --> 10:59.457
I'll help you fix it, daddy.

10:59.524 --> 11:03.661
If you take the contrast
and turn it to the left,
and you take the horizontal--

11:03.729 --> 11:07.197
them knobs
don't mean nothin'.
Get outta here.

11:07.266 --> 11:09.634
<i>Edith, what's wrong</i>
<i>with this set?</i>

11:09.701 --> 11:13.638
45 minutes till the show,
and all I get is a screen
full of dots and dashes.

11:13.705 --> 11:16.307
It does that in the afternoon
sometimes...

11:16.375 --> 11:18.643
When I'm watching
secret storm.

11:18.710 --> 11:22.012
Lately it does it
right through <i>edge of night.</i>

11:22.080 --> 11:25.650
You're wearin' out this set
with them
sufferin' soap operas.

11:25.717 --> 11:28.686
Well, sometimes it clears up,
Archie,

11:28.754 --> 11:30.688
if I stand right here...

11:30.756 --> 11:33.691
And jump up and down
a few times.

11:35.360 --> 11:37.561
Would you cut that out!

11:37.629 --> 11:39.229
This is serious here.

11:40.632 --> 11:43.567
Hey, hold it.
You got a picture
with that last jump.

11:44.836 --> 11:47.271
But it's bending
in the middle.

11:47.339 --> 11:50.441
You can fix that easy
just by hitting it on the side.

11:51.610 --> 11:55.546
<i>[ Tv: Descending tone ]</i>

12:04.423 --> 12:06.724
I think you hit it too hard.

12:09.394 --> 12:12.129
You didn't say nothin'
about hard or not hard.
You said, hit it.

12:12.197 --> 12:15.032
And that's what I done.

12:15.099 --> 12:17.535
We ain't got nothin'
but the dot.

12:18.837 --> 12:21.271

23:11.856 --> 23:14.791
Oh, Archie, he don't know
what he's doin'.

23:19.030 --> 23:21.465
Come on, kelsey.
Nobody's listening to this.

23:21.532 --> 23:25.335
Wait a minute. Hold it.
They may get back to me
any minute.

23:25.403 --> 23:27.004
Nixon's almost finished.

23:27.071 --> 23:29.339
...Throughout
this great land of ours.

23:32.543 --> 23:34.478
Thank you
and good night.

23:34.545 --> 23:36.346
[ Archie ]
Oh, good night, nurse.

23:36.414 --> 23:39.349
Come on, kelcy.
Put the ball game on.
Wait a minute!

23:39.417 --> 23:42.886
There might be
a piece of me on there--
who's this guy?

23:42.953 --> 23:44.721
That's Dan rather.

23:44.788 --> 23:48.358
He's gonna tell everybody
what Mr. Nixon just said.

23:49.460 --> 23:51.328
Come on, kelsey!

23:51.396 --> 23:53.663
Archie,
I gotta change it.

23:53.731 --> 23:56.333
Go ahead and change it.
Let's get outta here.

23:56.401 --> 23:59.769
Hey, arch, six bucks
for the drinks, huh?

24:01.772 --> 24:03.973
Aw, geez.

24:04.042 --> 24:05.642
I tell ya,

24:05.709 --> 24:09.379
that Nixon's gonna open
his mouth once too often.

24:09.447 --> 24:12.882
He ain't gonna have
Archie bunker
to kick around no more.

24:20.491 --> 24:23.693
I wanna tell you,
that was the lousiest break
I ever had.

24:23.761 --> 24:26.196
Oh, arch,
you just got pre-empted.

24:26.264 --> 24:29.933
That's the way Nixon
does things-- he runs
the country by surprise.

24:30.000 --> 24:34.037
Why don't he let somebody else
talk for a change?
<i>[ Doorbell rings ]</i>

24:34.105 --> 24:37.240
You're right, arch.
He shouldn't have cut you off.
You're as smart as he is.

24:37.308 --> 24:39.609
Certainly.

24:39.677 --> 24:42.112
<i>Hi, everybody.</i>
<i>Hey, I saw your show,</i>
<i>Mr. bunker.</i>

24:42.180 --> 24:44.114
That was a great makeup job.

24:47.251 --> 24:49.186
- Huh?
- You looked just like Nixon.

24:49.253 --> 24:51.788
How'd they do that,
sponges in the cheeks?

24:51.855 --> 24:54.291
Oh, come on, Lionel,
cut that out.

24:54.358 --> 24:55.892
[ Giggling ]

25:03.501 --> 25:06.803
Lionel, you're turning out to be
a regular flop Wilson, ain't ya?

25:22.286 --> 25:26.689

All in the family <i>was recorded</i>
