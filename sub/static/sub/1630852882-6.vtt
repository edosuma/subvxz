WEBVTT

01:07.651 --> 01:09.153
Lenny.

01:09.153 --> 01:11.530
Good morning.
Would you like some coffee?

01:11.614 --> 01:14.325
- I...
- We have bagels, bialys, grapefruit.

01:14.325 --> 01:16.494
- Zelda could make you a blintz.
- Oh, yes. Go with the blintz.

01:16.619 --> 01:18.037
The blintz is
a wonderful choice.

01:18.037 --> 01:20.331
I'm sorry, who are you?

01:20.331 --> 01:22.416
- Miss December.
- You look different.

01:22.500 --> 01:24.794
It was the night you were
talking about Miss December.

01:24.794 --> 01:26.295
We were in jail together.

01:26.295 --> 01:28.005
Well, I've been in jail
with a variety of people.

01:28.005 --> 01:29.507
Oh, by the way,
we told the children

01:29.507 --> 01:30.883
you were in their room
because you had

01:30.883 --> 01:32.426
a tummy ache from eating
too many cookies.

01:32.510 --> 01:34.804
We'd like you to stick with
that story, if you don't mind.

01:34.804 --> 01:36.263
Personally, I advocated
for the truth.

01:36.347 --> 01:38.808
I wasn't in the mood
to describe a mild case

01:38.808 --> 01:41.519
of alcohol poisoning to a
five-year-old, so if he asks...

01:41.519 --> 01:43.062
- Who?
- Ethan.

01:43.062 --> 01:44.522
I don't know who...

01:44.522 --> 01:47.399
If a child asks you why
you're here, your answer is...

01:49.318 --> 01:50.820
I thought you said
he was bright.

01:50.820 --> 01:52.279
I was talking about his humor.

01:52.363 --> 01:53.906
As a man,
he could be a total idiot.

01:53.906 --> 01:55.366
Excuse me.

01:55.366 --> 01:57.743
Uh, last night,
I had a few more things on me.

01:57.827 --> 02:01.247
A... a coat, shoes, a wallet.

02:01.247 --> 02:03.332
- D-Does anyone else hear that?
- Success.

02:03.332 --> 02:05.543
Hey, look who's finally up.

02:05.543 --> 02:07.920
- Wait. You.
- Oh?

02:07.920 --> 02:09.922
- I know you.
- I know you, too.

02:09.922 --> 02:12.007
And you are
a very sound sleeper.

02:12.091 --> 02:13.384
Ethan climbed right over you

02:13.384 --> 02:15.261
to get his fire truck,
and you didn't budge.

02:15.261 --> 02:17.179
Wait. Oh, God.

02:19.932 --> 02:22.017
That's the Hudson River out the window.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.727
Upper West Side.

02:23.811 --> 02:26.272
You're right-- he must have
someone else write his material.

02:26.272 --> 02:28.691
- You want some coffee?
- We offered. He just stared.

02:28.691 --> 02:30.317
I'm sorry I wasn't there
when you woke up,

02:30.401 --> 02:31.861
but I'm toilet-training
my daughter.

02:31.861 --> 02:33.612
When she does good,
she gets the song.

02:33.696 --> 02:35.906
And today,
she did very, very good.

02:35.990 --> 02:37.283
Yesterday was a disaster.

02:37.283 --> 02:38.492
We have to replace
the wallpaper.

02:38.576 --> 02:40.160
Well, everybody has their ups...

02:40.244 --> 02:42.288
- Uh, could I...
- Hmm?

02:42.288 --> 02:44.498
- Do you want to take a shower?
- I do not want to take a shower.

02:44.582 --> 02:46.000
I think
you should take a shower.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.543
Thank you very much,
lady in the kitchen.

02:47.543 --> 02:50.004
I will shower when I... Shit.

02:50.004 --> 02:52.631
Oh. Ow.

02:52.715 --> 02:54.466
How did I get here?

02:54.550 --> 02:56.552
- What do you remember?
- Nothing.

02:56.552 --> 02:58.804
Well, last night, I was
driving home from the club,

02:58.888 --> 03:00.639
and I saw you
passed out on the ground.

03:00.723 --> 03:02.433
I tried to ask you
where you were staying,

03:02.433 --> 03:04.143
and you said, "Nice hair."

03:04.143 --> 03:06.061
- I said, "Nice hair"?
- No, but for the sake

03:06.145 --> 03:07.479
of our friendship,
let's stick with "hair."

03:07.563 --> 03:09.315
Anyhow, I said, "Thanks,"
and I brought you here

03:09.315 --> 03:10.691
and stuck you in my son's room.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.568
- Oh, with the tiny bed.
- Well, he's five.

03:12.568 --> 03:14.445
- Was I robbed last night?
- Not that I know of.

03:14.445 --> 03:17.156
Where are my shoes,
my jacket, my wallet, my watch?

03:17.156 --> 03:18.908
Zelda insisted
on pressing your jacket

03:18.908 --> 03:21.285
and shining your shoes, and
I took your wallet and hid it

03:21.285 --> 03:23.245
because Ethan's going through
a money-eating phase,

03:23.329 --> 03:24.997
and I have no idea
where your watch is.

03:24.997 --> 03:26.582
- Let me go look.
- Wait.

03:26.582 --> 03:28.834
- I need your pants.
- I need them more.

03:28.918 --> 03:30.502
They are wrinkled.
They are bad pants.

03:30.586 --> 03:32.838
Well, you just have to
get to know them better.

03:32.922 --> 03:35.883
Okay!
I found your watch!

03:35.883 --> 03:37.718
Oh. Zelda,
the jacket looks great.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.178
You want to give her your pants?

03:39.178 --> 03:40.554
Take a wild guess.

03:40.638 --> 03:42.514
He's keeping the pants, Zelda.

03:42.598 --> 03:44.767
Shoes and wallet.

03:44.767 --> 03:46.518
Ethan did find it,
and he took a bite

03:46.602 --> 03:48.312
out of a ten spot,
so I'll reimburse you.

03:48.312 --> 03:50.606
I could not find your tie,
but it'll turn up eventually.

03:50.606 --> 03:52.191
Keep the tie.

03:52.191 --> 03:54.860
- Lenny.
- I have ties.

03:54.944 --> 03:57.488
Thank you for this,
but the next time you see me

03:57.488 --> 03:59.281
and you think
that I might need help,

03:59.365 --> 04:01.450
please just keep walking.

04:02.451 --> 04:03.869
Hey.

04:03.953 --> 04:06.497
Hey. Drama queen.

04:08.290 --> 04:09.667
Dead end.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.838
Can we please... Lenny.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.632
The elevator...

04:23.514 --> 04:25.641
Why the hell do you live
on such a high floor?

04:25.641 --> 04:27.601
Why are you... Really?

04:27.685 --> 04:28.978
Lenny!

04:28.978 --> 04:30.521
Morning, Mrs. Teitelbaum.

04:30.521 --> 04:31.814
Lenny!

04:32.856 --> 04:34.191
Lenny.

04:35.359 --> 04:37.486
Don't you have cabs
on the Upper West Side?

04:37.486 --> 04:40.030
Honestly, they may be
steering clear of you.

04:40.114 --> 04:41.532
- Here.
- What's that?

04:41.532 --> 04:43.701
- That's your shoe.
- No, I'm wearing my...

04:43.701 --> 04:45.160
Two seconds ago, it was on.

04:45.244 --> 04:47.454
- Why are you so upset?
- I have to get home.

04:47.538 --> 04:49.707
I basically scraped you
off the sidewalk last night,

04:49.707 --> 04:51.834
and you're mad at me?
You should be thankful.

04:51.834 --> 04:53.711
I'm thankful.
Go back inside.

04:53.711 --> 04:55.379
Protect the wallpaper
at all costs.

04:55.379 --> 04:57.047
You do know you're acting
like a child, right?

04:57.131 --> 04:58.549
Of course I'm acting
like a child.

04:58.549 --> 05:00.634
I'm a comedian.
Please go back inside.

05:00.718 --> 05:02.553
Lenny Bruce. That's Lenny Bruce.

05:02.553 --> 05:04.221
- Hey, Lenny.
- Yes. Hello.

05:04.221 --> 05:05.723
- Lenny, you're the best.
- Thank you.

05:05.723 --> 05:07.224
I don't understand
what's going on here.

05:07.224 --> 05:09.560
- You don't?
- You're the king, Lenny. The fucking king.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.437
Thank you.
As my subject, you're dismissed.

05:11.437 --> 05:12.646
- Both of you.
- Lenny.

05:12.730 --> 05:14.023
If you want a cab,
you might want to try...

05:14.064 --> 05:15.190
- Don't tell me how to get a cab.
- Lenny!

05:15.274 --> 05:16.900
I wasn't telling you
how to get a cab.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.736
I was telling you
where to get a cab.

05:18.736 --> 05:20.195
- Lenny!
- I can get a cab.

05:20.279 --> 05:21.655
I've been getting cabs
since before you were born.

05:21.739 --> 05:24.241
Hey, Lenny, I'm talking to you.
Look at me.

05:24.241 --> 05:26.452
Is this really how you act
when someone does you a favor?

05:26.452 --> 05:27.953
I'm over here
giving you compliments,

05:28.037 --> 05:29.830
- and you're ignoring me.
- I'm sorry, have you two met?

05:29.830 --> 05:31.665
Hey. Fuck you, Bruce.
You hear me?

05:31.749 --> 05:33.083
You're the poor man's Mort Sahl.

05:33.167 --> 05:34.460
The-the light's green, sir.

05:34.460 --> 05:36.170
Go iron your pants,
you cocksucker.

05:36.170 --> 05:37.921
Why are you acting like this?

05:38.005 --> 05:40.007
Because this is not my scene.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.009
This place, that apron,

05:42.009 --> 05:43.886
Grandma and Grandpa
having breakfast,

05:43.886 --> 05:46.263
kids running around
learning to shit,

05:46.263 --> 05:48.599
Leni Riefenstahl
demanding my pants.

05:48.599 --> 05:50.684
Well, the last one's
a little my scene, but...

05:50.768 --> 05:53.312
Wow. I am absolutely stunned.

05:53.312 --> 05:55.105
- I know you meant well.
- Yeah. I meant well.

05:55.189 --> 05:57.066
I brought you to my home
so you could sleep it off

05:57.066 --> 05:58.776
in a bed and not a holding cell.

05:58.776 --> 06:01.195
Sorry my parents and my kids
are not your scene.

06:01.195 --> 06:03.822
I don't care about the kids.
I have a kid.

06:03.906 --> 06:05.908
- You do?
- Yes.

06:05.908 --> 06:07.951
- Boy or girl?
- Girl.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.578
- You've never mentioned her.
- Really?

06:09.578 --> 06:11.872
In all the times we've been
sitting around knitting

06:11.872 --> 06:14.291
and making apple dolls
while the pies bake in the oven,

06:14.291 --> 06:16.168
I've never discussed
my child with you?

06:16.168 --> 06:18.420
You know why?
Because we're not supposed to.

06:18.504 --> 06:20.672
That's not how it works.
We're comics.

06:20.756 --> 06:22.382
[à la Dracula] Creatures
of the night.

06:22.466 --> 06:24.510
We discuss debauchery
and pornography.

06:24.510 --> 06:26.845
We make jokes about dictators
coming over for dinner.

06:26.929 --> 06:28.931
Ten minutes on
how Stalin likes his steak.

06:28.931 --> 06:31.558
We don't wear aprons
and discuss potty training.

06:31.642 --> 06:34.686
If I want to talk about my
daughter, I'll call my mother.

06:36.522 --> 06:37.940
What are you doing?

06:37.940 --> 06:39.441
I have to take a piss.

06:39.525 --> 06:41.819
Well, come back upstairs
and use the bathroom.

06:41.819 --> 06:43.612
If I use your bathroom,
you'll play music.

06:43.612 --> 06:45.531
I don't want a soundtrack
while I pee.

06:45.531 --> 06:46.740
Finally.

06:46.824 --> 06:48.784
Look, I'm...

06:48.784 --> 06:51.578
I know I'm... Here.

06:51.662 --> 06:54.081
I'm sorry. What do you think
happened last night?

06:54.081 --> 06:57.543
No, it-it's for the taxi,
the shoe polishing, the blintz.

06:57.543 --> 06:59.670
Christ.

06:59.670 --> 07:02.005
It was a really terrific carpenter.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.883
Ice cream! Ice cream!

07:09.304 --> 07:11.223
Hey.
Aren't you Lenny Bruce?

07:11.223 --> 07:12.808
Just drive.

07:12.808 --> 07:14.226
Operator.
What's the number, please?

07:14.226 --> 07:16.979
Yeah, hi. I'm looking
for the number of a nightclub.

07:16.979 --> 07:18.856
<i>What's the name
of the nightclub?</i>

07:18.856 --> 07:21.400
I don't know the name,
but I do know it's in Chinatown.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.485
- Does that help?
- <i>No.</i>

07:23.569 --> 07:25.904
Okay, well, could you look up
clubs in Chinatown?

07:25.988 --> 07:27.114
No.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.740
Well, could you
list off anything

07:28.824 --> 07:30.659
that sounds like
a club in Chinatown?

07:30.659 --> 07:32.578
<i>I could. Could you answer</i>

07:32.578 --> 07:34.621
<i>all my other calls
for the next six hours?</i>

07:34.705 --> 07:37.332
You know, I'm a talent manager.
Ever thought of going onstage?

07:37.416 --> 07:39.209
Oh, wait. Joel Maisel.

07:39.293 --> 07:41.795
Try Joel Maisel's club in Chinatow...

07:41.879 --> 07:43.380
Hello?

07:44.423 --> 07:46.258
You were supposed to share.

07:49.511 --> 07:51.471
- Dinah.
- Yes?

07:51.555 --> 07:53.223
I need to get Mike Carr.

07:53.307 --> 07:54.850
I left word earlier twice.

07:54.850 --> 07:56.643
- Did you use my name?
- God, no.

07:56.727 --> 07:58.353
Good.

07:58.437 --> 08:01.315
Appreciate you eating all this
on my bed, by the way.

08:01.315 --> 08:03.066
You should have the lady
find the club.

08:03.150 --> 08:06.111
- What lady?
- The lady who sits out there.

08:06.195 --> 08:07.696
Have her find the club.

08:07.696 --> 08:09.406
That's why she's there, right?

08:09.406 --> 08:13.535
Sitting there every day,
just listening?

08:13.619 --> 08:16.205
Do not eat on my bed,
and mind your own business.

08:16.205 --> 08:17.915
No. That's too much
direction at one time.

08:17.915 --> 08:19.458
- Thank you.
- Have a good day.

08:19.458 --> 08:20.626
You just
got another one.

08:20.626 --> 08:22.336
Wines of the world.

08:22.336 --> 08:24.922
The "O" in "world" is
a little globe. Cute.

08:24.922 --> 08:27.466
You better hide it before Alfie
gets his passport out.

08:27.466 --> 08:29.468
Miss Lennon sure is grateful
to you for something.

08:29.468 --> 08:32.054
Well, she's grateful the voices
in her head haven't unionized.

08:32.054 --> 08:34.348
Listen, Midge's ex has
a club in Chinatown,

08:34.348 --> 08:35.933
and I'm trying
to get the number.

08:35.933 --> 08:37.684
- I'm on it.
- I don't remember the name.

08:37.768 --> 08:39.353
Yep. I'm on it.

08:39.353 --> 08:41.104
- Who is this again?
- That's my niece.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.940
- My sister had to work today.
- Uh-huh.

08:42.940 --> 08:44.775
I'm not sure if that's the
most professional thing to do.

08:44.775 --> 08:46.318
- Hello, sir!
- Oh, it is.

08:46.318 --> 08:48.195
Every office I've worked in,
all the secretaries did this.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.739
It's not lost on me you don't
work at those offices anymore.

08:50.739 --> 08:52.658
Shh. I'm on the phone.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.912
It said there were
cookies in here.

08:56.912 --> 08:58.497
I hate being lied to.

08:58.497 --> 09:00.290
Hey, how about
you go find a cute blonde

09:00.374 --> 09:02.251
so you can saw her in half
or something?

09:02.251 --> 09:03.543
I have Joel Maisel on the line.

09:03.627 --> 09:04.836
You did not find him that fast.

09:04.920 --> 09:06.171
- Yes, I did.
- Joel Maisel?

09:06.255 --> 09:07.547
- Yes.
- You found Joel Maisel?

09:07.631 --> 09:09.174
- Yes.
- I didn't tell you his name.

09:09.258 --> 09:11.468
- You gonna pick up the phone?
- I am gonna pick up the phone.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.303
Now, that's a fucking magician.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.556
Joel? Hello.

09:16.640 --> 09:19.476
Susie Myerson
at Susie Myerson and Associates.

09:19.476 --> 09:22.187
- How are you today, buddy?
- Who is this?

09:22.271 --> 09:25.148
It's Susie Myerson
of Susie Myerson and Associates.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.984
I hope I am not
interrupting anything.

09:26.984 --> 09:28.068
Who is this?

09:28.068 --> 09:29.861
You are a very funny guy.

09:29.945 --> 09:32.364
Anyhow, Joel, I'm calling today
to talk to you about...

09:32.364 --> 09:33.991
Wait, you do know
who this is, right?

09:33.991 --> 09:36.368
I've narrowed it down to either
Bette Davis or Rock Hudson.

09:36.410 --> 09:39.121
I am just trying
to reset our relationship.

09:39.121 --> 09:40.497
We don't have
a relationship to reset.

09:40.497 --> 09:41.873
Let's set one.

09:41.957 --> 09:44.584
I am a talent manager.
You own a nightclub.

09:44.668 --> 09:47.045
We may wind up doing business
together down the road.

09:47.129 --> 09:49.506
So just shut your goddamn trap
and act professional.

09:49.506 --> 09:51.425
"Manager." Come on.
You have one client,

09:51.425 --> 09:53.468
and she can come down here
anytime. She knows that.

09:53.552 --> 09:56.305
Actually, I have
an exciting new client now.

09:56.305 --> 09:57.973
One that you haven't fucked.

09:57.973 --> 09:59.808
- Comic?
- <i>Magician.</i>

09:59.808 --> 10:01.310
Like card tricks and shit?

10:01.310 --> 10:03.562
No. Much more than card tricks.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.858
He is a master
of sleight of hand.

10:07.858 --> 10:09.609
An illusionist. A hypnotist.

10:09.693 --> 10:11.320
Hell, he may actually be magic.

10:11.320 --> 10:13.238
And there's no one
like him anywhere.

10:13.322 --> 10:15.615
I would love for you
to book him in your new club,

10:15.699 --> 10:18.577
which I have heard wonderful
things about, by the way.

10:18.577 --> 10:20.537
Stop that. It's unnerving.

10:20.537 --> 10:22.456
<i>I will take any slot
that you give him.</i>

10:22.456 --> 10:24.708
He's very cool, super hip.
The kids are gonna love him.

10:24.708 --> 10:26.168
Well, I got to see what he does.

10:26.168 --> 10:27.502
<i>Absolutely.</i>

10:27.586 --> 10:29.588
First show's free.
If he knocks you on your ass,

10:29.588 --> 10:31.340
you book him for a month. Deal?

10:31.340 --> 10:32.591
We'll see.

10:32.591 --> 10:34.301
Mm, savvy businessman.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.261
We are gonna make
beautiful music together.

10:36.345 --> 10:37.971
<i>All right, bye.</i>

10:39.639 --> 10:41.641
I was sitting on the cookies.

10:43.352 --> 10:44.853
Oscar Levant,

10:44.853 --> 10:46.897
<i>how many seconds
do you want to use</i>

10:46.897 --> 10:48.440
<i>- for your next question?
- Um, uh...</i>

10:48.440 --> 10:51.151
<i>You have 37 in the bank.</i>

10:51.151 --> 10:53.028
<i>I'll use, uh, 18.</i>

10:53.028 --> 10:56.031
<i>All right, in 18 seconds,</i>

10:56.031 --> 10:59.576
<i>name every state that begins
with an "M" or a "C."</i>

10:59.576 --> 11:01.161
<i>Start the clock.</i>

11:01.161 --> 11:04.373
<i>Uh, "M," uh, Mississippi,
Missouri, Maine, Melinda.</i>

11:04.373 --> 11:06.792
<i>No, that's not a state. That's an ex-wife.</i>

11:06.792 --> 11:08.377
<i>You secede from the union?</i>

11:08.377 --> 11:09.920
<i>After she fired
on my Fort Sumter.</i>

11:11.797 --> 11:15.425
Mama, Papa, the kids are asleep,
and I'm heading out.

11:15.509 --> 11:17.094
...but Sandy over here

11:17.094 --> 11:18.762
<i>just got attacked
by a microphone.</i>

11:18.762 --> 11:21.014
<i>Sandy, what the heck
just happened?</i>

11:21.098 --> 11:23.100
I got hit
in the head with the boom.

11:23.100 --> 11:25.560
I know.
I heard the boom.

11:25.644 --> 11:27.479
I'm sorry.
Who's talking?

11:31.608 --> 11:33.902
Luckily, I'm wearing
two kinds of hairspray.

11:36.822 --> 11:38.740
Pete's the culprit.

11:38.824 --> 11:40.617
<i>All right, Oscar,
I didn't forget you.</i>

11:40.617 --> 11:41.952
<i>Start the clock.</i>

11:41.952 --> 11:44.079
Montana, uh, California,

11:44.079 --> 11:46.665
<i>Connecticut, Cucamonga.
Is that a state?</i>

11:46.665 --> 11:48.542
<i>A state of confusion
is more like it.</i>

11:48.542 --> 11:50.168
<i></i>

11:50.252 --> 11:51.336
Time's up.

11:51.420 --> 11:53.171
- Ooh. What did he miss?
- He missed Michigan.

11:53.255 --> 11:54.798
- He missed Colorado.
- That's right.

11:54.798 --> 11:56.425
- What's going on here?
- It's <i>Seconds Count!</i>

11:56.425 --> 11:58.718
- It's so fun.
- And Sophie is hysterical.

11:58.802 --> 12:00.595
She's at her absolute best.

12:00.679 --> 12:02.222
I was talking about
the TV trays.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.599
- They're for Sophie's show.
- If you miss an episode,

12:04.683 --> 12:06.560
you can't converse
with anyone the next day,

12:06.560 --> 12:08.478
because it's all people
want to talk about.

12:08.562 --> 12:10.105
So on Thursday nights,
we eat here.

12:10.105 --> 12:11.606
Different. Okay.

12:11.690 --> 12:12.941
Well, the kids are asleep,

12:12.941 --> 12:14.401
the fridge light's out,
and I'm taking off.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.819
So long.

12:15.819 --> 12:18.321
Okay, in your
remaining time, name...

12:18.405 --> 12:21.324
You do know she tried to destroy
your daughter's career, right?

12:21.408 --> 12:23.660
- Who? Sophie?
- Yes, Sophie.

12:23.660 --> 12:25.787
- Water under the bridge.
- Whatever you say.

12:25.871 --> 12:28.081
- Carry on.
- Sandy, it's not the Big D.

12:28.165 --> 12:29.541
<i>- It's Austin.
- Austin!</i>

12:29.541 --> 12:30.792
It's not water under the bridge.

12:30.876 --> 12:32.377
We're missing the program.

12:32.461 --> 12:34.588
It's nostalgia, right?
You remember her from radio

12:34.588 --> 12:37.340
and a time when it was fun
to play with a hoop and a stick?

12:37.424 --> 12:39.176
No, it's because
we think she's hilarious.

12:39.176 --> 12:40.677
She's our new Chaplin.

12:40.677 --> 12:43.597
No comment. Adieu.

12:43.597 --> 12:45.390
Okay, if you meant
Buddy Chaplin,

12:45.474 --> 12:47.350
the guy who measures feet
at the kids' shoe store

12:47.434 --> 12:49.478
and is rumored to have
a dead piece of a Siamese twin

12:49.478 --> 12:51.354
sticking out of his stomach,
then yes, maybe.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.106
But Charlie Chaplin?

12:53.190 --> 12:55.734
<i>Modern Times? The Gold Rush?</i>
I think not.

12:55.734 --> 12:57.611
I thought you didn't have any comment.

12:57.611 --> 13:00.780
Damn! Missed it.
She just said something funny.

13:00.864 --> 13:02.365
She never says something funny.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.951
It's all ridiculously
contrived "bon motts."

13:05.035 --> 13:06.953
- That's all it is.
- They're not contrived.

13:07.037 --> 13:08.663
And if you had studied French
instead of Russian,

13:08.747 --> 13:10.040
you'd know it was...
<i>bon mots.</i>

13:10.040 --> 13:12.000
Well, that's mo'
than I needed to know.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.251
Thank you.

13:13.335 --> 13:14.544
Sophie's contrived,
but that's funny?

13:14.628 --> 13:15.962
Okay, I heard that.

13:16.046 --> 13:17.797
Oh, we're missing
the commercial.

13:17.881 --> 13:19.257
It's a laxative commercial.

13:19.341 --> 13:21.301
Yeah, but she does them,
and she does them funny.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.637
She's so irreverent.
And she's lost so much weight.

13:23.637 --> 13:25.847
I think I've said my piece.

13:25.931 --> 13:28.141
- Peace would be nice.
- Amen.

13:39.736 --> 13:41.571
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

13:43.740 --> 13:46.451
Hey!
What's going on up there?

13:52.874 --> 13:54.417
Come on!

13:56.336 --> 13:58.672
Whoa!

14:00.674 --> 14:02.592
The hot water
in the shower is back on.

14:02.676 --> 14:05.011
The coffee area was cleaned,
and we got a new coffee maker.

14:05.095 --> 14:07.472
We got cream and sugar
even though sugar means bugs.

14:07.556 --> 14:08.974
That's what sugar bowls are for.

14:08.974 --> 14:10.600
We will get a sugar bowl.

14:10.684 --> 14:12.978
We moved the paint cans
and tarps from the storage room.

14:12.978 --> 14:14.563
The floor-to-ceiling mirror's
been hung.

14:14.563 --> 14:16.481
The new seamstress is here.
She did not come with

14:16.565 --> 14:18.108
her own sewing machine,
as you had promised,

14:18.108 --> 14:19.776
but when we moved
the paint cans and tarps,

14:19.776 --> 14:22.571
we found out we actually had
a sewing machine,

14:22.571 --> 14:24.531
so there you go.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.199
The roof will be fixed
next week.

14:26.283 --> 14:27.909
We found Duke's trumpet.

14:27.993 --> 14:29.953
We cannot find Duke.

14:29.953 --> 14:32.414
The dr... The dressing room
speaker works now,

14:32.414 --> 14:34.416
and we were unable
to remove the urinal

14:34.416 --> 14:36.668
from the ladies' room,
so we turned it into a planter.

14:36.668 --> 14:38.169
Boise, this is good progress.

14:38.253 --> 14:40.213
I just might make
a stage manager out of you yet.

14:40.297 --> 14:42.966
Hey, I'm not a stage manager.
I am a <i>manager</i> manager.

14:42.966 --> 14:45.969
I manage the stage, yes,
but I manage other things.

14:45.969 --> 14:47.637
The front room. I manage that.

14:47.721 --> 14:49.889
The loading dock. I am
definitely the manager of...

14:49.973 --> 14:51.516
Well, I share that
responsibility with Dave,

14:51.600 --> 14:53.310
- but when deliveries come, I am...
- Wrap it up.

14:53.310 --> 14:54.728
- I got to work.
- Yep.

15:07.699 --> 15:09.784
Whoops.

15:21.046 --> 15:22.922
Two gin rickeys,
three banana daiquiris,

15:23.006 --> 15:24.716
a Singapore sling
and a White Russian.

15:24.716 --> 15:26.259
- Extra Russian.
- Gin and sin, rum runner, sidecar,

15:26.343 --> 15:27.469
three grasshoppers,
one with whipped cream.

15:27.469 --> 15:28.595
Kenny, where's my sherry flip?

15:28.595 --> 15:29.971
I got three mai tais here,
no flip.

15:30.055 --> 15:31.640
Hold your horses.
What came after grasshoppers?

15:31.640 --> 15:33.183
- Sherry flip.
- Extra cherries.

15:33.183 --> 15:34.934
Sherry flip, sherry flip,
sherry flip, sherry...

15:35.018 --> 15:36.770
- Thank you.
- How's it going, Kenny?

15:36.770 --> 15:38.521
Out of white wine.

15:38.605 --> 15:41.191
Bartender, six palomas
to that table right down there.

15:41.191 --> 15:42.651
And keep 'em coming.

15:42.651 --> 15:45.654
- Paloma, paloma...
- Uh, excuse me.

15:45.654 --> 15:47.530
We're gonna need a grapefruit.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.034
Oh, yeah.

15:51.034 --> 15:53.119
Whoa.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.256
Hey!

16:12.097 --> 16:13.723
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.183
Hi.

16:17.018 --> 16:18.978
Excuse us.

16:19.062 --> 16:20.980
- Hi.
- Look, there she is.

16:23.441 --> 16:25.610
Well...

16:25.694 --> 16:28.571
Hello, hello, hello. Wow.

16:28.655 --> 16:31.282
Look at all the ladies in the audience tonight.

16:31.366 --> 16:34.953
You do realize the Bergdorf sale
is about 15 blocks north, right?

16:34.953 --> 16:37.080
Dresses here are also half off

16:37.080 --> 16:39.499
but probably not
in the way you're thinking.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.501
Hello, ladies. You lost?

16:41.501 --> 16:42.669
She's getting married
this weekend,

16:42.669 --> 16:43.795
and we brought her here.

16:43.795 --> 16:45.296
So I could talk her out of it?

16:46.381 --> 16:47.799
- What's your name?
- Nora.

16:47.799 --> 16:49.092
Congratulations, Nora.

16:49.092 --> 16:50.301
What's your fiancé's name?

16:50.385 --> 16:51.302
Montgomery.

16:51.386 --> 16:52.595
Got a picture?

16:54.973 --> 16:57.726
Not bad. Huh?

16:57.726 --> 17:00.311
But remember, one day,
you go to bed with this,

17:00.395 --> 17:02.522
the next day,
you wake up with that.

17:03.732 --> 17:06.234
I'm just kidding, sir.

17:17.287 --> 17:19.789
And... stop.

17:21.124 --> 17:22.417
How's it going in here?

17:22.417 --> 17:24.169
- I like the look.
- I know.

17:24.169 --> 17:25.920
They're my smart-girl glasses.
Totally fake.

17:26.004 --> 17:27.922
They look so real.

17:28.006 --> 17:31.760
Ladies, I can hear every word
you are pretending not to say.

17:31.760 --> 17:34.262
Well, I am impressed.

17:34.262 --> 17:35.555
- Dody...
- Imogene.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.223
...has just broken
her previous record,

17:37.307 --> 17:39.267
which she set
exactly ten minutes ago.

17:39.267 --> 17:41.060
80 words a minute.

17:41.144 --> 17:42.937
Not my personal best,
but it was James Joyce,

17:43.021 --> 17:44.939
- so I was very nervous.
- I'm sorry, what?

17:45.023 --> 17:46.191
I was transcribing
<i>Finnegans Wake.</i>

17:46.191 --> 17:47.400
It feels like
you're writing gibberish,

17:47.484 --> 17:48.693
but apparently, he's a genius.

17:48.777 --> 17:50.361
I had a feeling
you two would hit it off.

17:50.445 --> 17:52.071
Hit it off?
That's putting it mildly.

17:52.155 --> 17:53.740
- Dody...
- Imogene.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.658
...is a diamond
in the coal mine.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.494
I don't think that's the saying,
but I don't care.

17:57.494 --> 18:00.872
My God, to have the freedom
to write but not have to type?

18:00.872 --> 18:02.791
My whole life will be different.

18:02.791 --> 18:04.959
- So I'm hired?
- I will never let you leave.

18:05.043 --> 18:06.795
- I'm a hostage! Yay!
- Miss Miriam!

18:06.795 --> 18:08.171
Coming, Zelda!

18:08.171 --> 18:09.631
- So, Dody...
- Imogene.

18:09.631 --> 18:11.299
Ready for some Proust?

18:11.299 --> 18:13.468
The real question is:
Is Mr. Proust ready for me?

18:13.468 --> 18:14.803
Oh.

18:14.803 --> 18:16.513
The fridge is dead.

18:16.513 --> 18:18.848
I come in, I open, no light.
Things are warm.

18:18.932 --> 18:20.642
I try to see if it's plug.

18:20.642 --> 18:22.519
I plug there, I plug there.
It's not plug.

18:22.519 --> 18:24.938
Yeah, the light
was out last night.

18:24.938 --> 18:27.232
What do you mean,
"the light was out last night"?

18:27.232 --> 18:29.067
I opened the fridge last night,
and there was no light.

18:29.067 --> 18:31.361
So it died last night and you
just left it there to stink?

18:31.361 --> 18:33.613
- I didn't know what it meant.
- You didn't know what it...

18:33.613 --> 18:35.281
What kind of woman are you?
You were married.

18:35.365 --> 18:36.950
You had children.
How did that happen?

18:36.950 --> 18:39.327
Well, it had nothing to do with
the fridge, I can assure you.

18:41.955 --> 18:43.748
Zelda, I will fix it.

18:43.832 --> 18:45.875
In the meantime,
let's ask some of the neighbors

18:45.959 --> 18:48.795
if they can store
some things for us, huh?

18:52.340 --> 18:54.592
Come on in,
Norma and Lorraine.

18:54.676 --> 18:56.803
We'll sit down,
have some iced tea,

18:56.803 --> 18:58.847
and you can tell me
everything about yourselves

18:58.847 --> 19:01.140
that might be of interest...

19:02.392 --> 19:03.726
- Abe.
- Rose.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.395
This girl is a prodigy.

19:05.395 --> 19:06.813
If the government
knew about her,

19:06.813 --> 19:08.439
she'd be locked in a lab
getting probed.

19:08.523 --> 19:10.024
- Time.
- Ha!

19:10.108 --> 19:11.609
Excuse me, ladies.

19:11.693 --> 19:13.570
Abe, I reserved
the living room yesterday.

19:13.570 --> 19:15.905
- Didn't you consult the chart?
- I did not consult the chart.

19:15.989 --> 19:17.407
Well, it was your idea
to make the chart,

19:17.407 --> 19:18.950
so I assumed
you would consult the chart.

19:18.950 --> 19:21.035
- We're almost done.
- After all, you made the chart.

19:21.119 --> 19:22.579
- I'm leaving. Dody...
- Imogene!

19:22.579 --> 19:24.122
Gather your things
and follow me.

19:24.122 --> 19:25.790
We can go to the bathroom.

19:25.874 --> 19:27.584
That's where
I usually work anyway.

19:27.584 --> 19:30.128
I'm going to get that tea.

19:33.381 --> 19:35.383
Goodness,
what is happening here?

19:35.383 --> 19:37.969
The fridge died, and Zelda
forgot she taught me Polish.

19:37.969 --> 19:39.512
Hello?

19:44.601 --> 19:46.394
Oh. Hi.

19:46.394 --> 19:48.730
I'm Miriam Maisel.

19:48.730 --> 19:51.274
You two look like you have
a refrigerator at home.

19:51.274 --> 19:53.192
Well, yes,
that sounds wonderful.

19:53.276 --> 19:55.278
I would be honored to attend.

19:55.278 --> 19:56.779
Mm-hmm.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.323
All right.

19:58.323 --> 19:59.657
Thank you.

19:59.741 --> 20:01.200
How could you not
teach your daughter

20:01.284 --> 20:02.577
about the light in the fridge?

20:02.577 --> 20:04.245
There's a light in the fridge?

20:05.288 --> 20:07.248
Miriam, guess what.

20:07.332 --> 20:09.417
I have been invited to the
Small Business Women's Council

20:09.417 --> 20:11.002
annual luncheon
in Brighton Beach.

20:11.002 --> 20:12.587
- Really?
- That's right.

20:12.587 --> 20:15.089
Your mother's now officially
known as a small businesswoman.

20:15.173 --> 20:17.175
No, wait.
A small women's business.

20:17.175 --> 20:18.801
No, I'm the owner of a business,

20:18.885 --> 20:20.345
and it's small,
and I'm a woman, so...

20:20.345 --> 20:21.679
Well, I'm getting a free lunch.

20:21.763 --> 20:23.348
Congratulations, Mama. Really.

20:23.348 --> 20:25.016
Thank you.

20:26.809 --> 20:28.186
Miriam.

20:28.186 --> 20:29.562
What?

20:29.646 --> 20:31.147
I offered. They took.

20:31.147 --> 20:33.566
You didn't even ask them
to sit down first?

20:33.650 --> 20:35.652
Oh. Yeah. Would you like
to have a seat?

20:35.652 --> 20:37.820
Goodbye, Miriam.

20:37.904 --> 20:40.114
I am so sorry.
That was my daughter.

20:40.198 --> 20:42.158
She's... hilarious.
She was kicked in the head

20:42.158 --> 20:44.160
by a horse when she was
a child, also, so...

20:45.745 --> 20:48.039

21:11.229 --> 21:14.315
Dinah? Dinah!

21:15.942 --> 21:17.777
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

21:17.777 --> 21:20.071
- Somebody loves you.
- This is not love.

21:20.071 --> 21:22.073
They came with a golf pro,
but he had to leave.

21:22.073 --> 21:23.825
- I have his card.
- Get me Sophie Lennon.

21:23.825 --> 21:26.244
On it.

21:26.244 --> 21:27.954
They're fucking multiplying.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.747
Thomas,
when you catch her, wash her.

21:29.831 --> 21:31.958
Fuck! Fuck.

21:33.376 --> 21:36.129
Sorry. I know.
I was gonna move those.

21:36.129 --> 21:38.548
I've got Sophie Lennon
on line one.

21:38.548 --> 21:41.384
Dinah, there's only one line.
Stop saying "line one."

21:41.384 --> 21:44.095
But when people hear "line one,"
they think there's a line two.

21:44.095 --> 21:46.514
- It makes you sound important.
- I am important, Dinah.

21:46.514 --> 21:48.808
- I'm important.
- I want people to know that.

21:48.808 --> 21:51.060
Close the door.

21:51.144 --> 21:53.062
Sophie, it's got to stop now.

21:53.146 --> 21:54.313
It's not Miss Lennon.

21:54.397 --> 21:55.440
Oh, goody. Humbert Humbert.

21:55.440 --> 21:56.566
Put your boss on.

21:56.566 --> 21:57.984
I'm afraid I can't.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.569
She's having her Roman wax.

21:59.569 --> 22:01.320
Her what?

22:01.404 --> 22:02.739
It's the removal of hair

22:02.739 --> 22:04.490
from where it shouldn't be.

22:06.451 --> 22:07.869
Cadillac!

22:07.869 --> 22:09.328
Did you like the Cadillac?

22:09.412 --> 22:11.289
Dawes, tell her
I hate the Cadillac,

22:11.289 --> 22:13.416
the luggage stinks,
and that there's no point

22:13.416 --> 22:15.460
in sending gifts, so just stop.

22:15.460 --> 22:17.295
Miss Lennon wants you
to have them.

22:17.295 --> 22:18.755
That's the point of gifts.

22:18.755 --> 22:20.673
Oh, and ask her
if she liked the Carava...

22:22.467 --> 22:23.968
She stopped
a couple syllables short,

22:24.052 --> 22:26.679
but I believe she was inquiring
about the Caravaggio.

22:26.763 --> 22:29.599
Dawes, I have no idea
what the fuck a Caravaggio is,

22:29.599 --> 22:32.018
but you tell that crazy woman
we had a deal.

22:32.018 --> 22:34.937
I help her, and she goes the fuck away.

22:35.021 --> 22:36.564
She's objecting
to your generosity.

22:36.564 --> 22:37.982
She got me
the game show.

22:38.066 --> 22:39.484
<i>Dawes, tell her that.</i>

22:39.484 --> 22:40.818
- She says...
- <i>All I did</i>

22:40.902 --> 22:42.153
was get her on Gordon Ford.

22:42.153 --> 22:43.863
She got the game show herself.

22:43.863 --> 22:46.157
So she can take back her gifts
and give them all to herself.

22:49.744 --> 22:51.954
Your guess is as good
as mine on that one.

22:52.038 --> 22:54.290
Goodbye.

22:54.290 --> 22:56.793
Dinah, get me
a new goddamn orange.

22:56.793 --> 22:59.295
You want me to fall over dead
from a heart attack.

22:59.295 --> 23:00.880
Is that what you want, Miriam?

23:00.880 --> 23:02.799
<i>Because you're doing
a great job,</i>

23:02.799 --> 23:04.258
<i>if that's what you want.</i>

23:04.342 --> 23:06.594
I don't want you to have
a heart attack, Moishe.

23:06.594 --> 23:08.221
You have been so good to me.

23:08.221 --> 23:10.640
I really have, haven't I?
I'm a good man.

23:10.640 --> 23:12.100
But I need to be honest here.

23:12.100 --> 23:15.144
I just need a smidgen of a skosh
more time for my next payment.

23:15.228 --> 23:16.813
What's that?
A smidgen of a skosh?

23:16.813 --> 23:18.106
Is that like a <i>bissel?</i>

23:18.106 --> 23:19.524
Say, a couple weeks?

23:19.524 --> 23:21.067
I just bagged a giant
Tupperware order

23:21.067 --> 23:22.610
from our professor neighbor
in nine-B.

23:22.610 --> 23:24.737
She brought the whole Barnard
geology department in on it.

23:24.821 --> 23:26.781
They're gonna use them
to store fossils.

23:26.781 --> 23:29.367
Now, I'm not talking
a Brownie Wise level order here.

23:29.367 --> 23:30.827
What's that? A Brownie Wise?

23:30.827 --> 23:32.036
She was the first one to toss

23:32.120 --> 23:33.746
a bowl filled with water
to one of the guests

23:33.830 --> 23:34.956
to demonstrate
its airtight sealability.

23:34.956 --> 23:36.707
<i>Brownie is a Tupperware legend.</i>

23:36.791 --> 23:38.209
Call an ambulance, Shirl!

23:38.209 --> 23:39.752
But I don't get my cut
from the order

23:39.836 --> 23:41.462
until the check clears,
and the check was drawn

23:41.546 --> 23:44.048
from a bank in Toronto,
so guess she's Canadian.

23:44.132 --> 23:46.509
Now that I think about it, she
does say "a-roond" and "a-boot."

23:46.509 --> 23:48.344
"Skosh" and "smidgen"
are not words suitable

23:48.344 --> 23:49.971
to a legally binding
contract, Miriam.

23:49.971 --> 23:51.556
<i>Are you aware of that?</i>

23:51.556 --> 23:53.432
Moishe, I'll let you go.
Thanks for understanding.

23:53.516 --> 23:55.059
Your grandchildren love you.

23:55.143 --> 23:56.686
<i>That's not gonna work this time!</i>

23:56.686 --> 23:58.855
I need a drink.

23:58.855 --> 24:00.648
How'd you get jelly
on your shirt?

24:00.648 --> 24:03.651
Oh, Dinah had a niece
with jelly on it.

24:06.612 --> 24:07.738
It's not fitting
the business model.

24:07.822 --> 24:09.115
We have
a business model?

24:09.115 --> 24:11.450
Girls, booze, men paying for it.
That's the business model.

24:11.534 --> 24:13.369
But she's funny, right?
You said she was funny.

24:13.369 --> 24:15.204
Yes, she's funny, but she's
turning the place into...

24:15.288 --> 24:16.497
I don't know what.

24:16.581 --> 24:18.166
Are you talking about me?

24:18.166 --> 24:20.710
I thought you'd left.
And hey, you didn't knock.

24:20.710 --> 24:22.920
Are you talking about me?

24:23.004 --> 24:25.089
- What is this, Boise?
- Terrence, Mrs. Maisel

24:25.173 --> 24:27.341
and her pushy little
midgety manager, Susie.

24:27.425 --> 24:28.676
Terrence is our partner.

24:28.676 --> 24:29.969
Very important partner.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.430
And Mario is what he looks like.

24:32.430 --> 24:35.141
Mrs. Maisel, you've scared up
quite the ruckus.

24:35.141 --> 24:36.726
How? The house is
packed every night.

24:36.726 --> 24:38.060
Yeah, with
the wrong kind of people.

24:38.144 --> 24:39.395
What's the wrong kind of people?

24:39.395 --> 24:41.439
The kind that make
pork chops for dinner.

24:41.439 --> 24:43.316
- Short-order cooks?
- Women.

24:43.316 --> 24:44.817
So what if
the audience is women?

24:44.901 --> 24:46.736
So what? This is a jiggle joint.

24:46.736 --> 24:49.197
- Don't say it like that.
- This is an entertainment venue

24:49.197 --> 24:51.991
- catering to a select male clientele.
- Who like titties.

24:51.991 --> 24:54.076
- So?
- So, men come here

24:54.160 --> 24:55.453
to get away from women.

24:55.453 --> 24:56.871
Except the women onstage.

24:56.871 --> 24:58.331
The whole place
smells different, too.

24:58.331 --> 24:59.707
- What are you smelling?
- It's what I'm not smelling.

24:59.707 --> 25:00.875
Beer, piss, ammonia.

25:00.875 --> 25:03.252
I changed the smell?
That's a neat trick.

25:03.336 --> 25:05.463
And is that so bad? That the
place doesn't smell like piss?

25:05.463 --> 25:07.215
Oh, good.
Bunny has something to add.

25:07.215 --> 25:09.342
- I don't like the smell of piss.
- Me, neither.

25:09.342 --> 25:11.302
And for me,
it depends on the circumstances.

25:11.302 --> 25:13.012
I'm sorry,
you guys should be sore.

25:13.012 --> 25:14.847
Maisel's hogging
all the spotlight.

25:14.931 --> 25:17.225
All I know is that since she got
here, the coffee's much better.

25:17.225 --> 25:18.935
And there's less weird guys
hanging around backstage.

25:18.935 --> 25:20.353
She got us a seamstress, too.

25:20.353 --> 25:21.687
Now our clothes
don't fall off us.

25:21.771 --> 25:23.314
They're supposed
to fall off you.

25:23.314 --> 25:25.566
- Terrence, the business model.
- Not that you're asking,

25:25.650 --> 25:27.193
but the women tip better,
you know.

25:27.193 --> 25:28.527
I wasn't asking, but thank you.

25:28.611 --> 25:30.029
Women are more generous
and giving.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.405
That's a fact of the species.

25:31.489 --> 25:33.115
We give life to fucking babies.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.367
You're off the clock, Bunny.

25:34.367 --> 25:35.826
No, you're off the clock, Boise!

25:35.910 --> 25:37.119
It wasn't an insult, Bunny.

25:37.203 --> 25:39.038
I'm saying you're off the clock.
Go home.

25:39.038 --> 25:41.832
They're not discreet, either,
and the cops are noticing.

25:41.916 --> 25:43.417
When a show's over, men leave.

25:43.501 --> 25:45.795
These women, they hang around
out front laughing, chatting.

25:45.795 --> 25:47.421
So what?
Makes the place seem fun.

25:47.505 --> 25:50.341
This business is illegal.
Do you not understand that?

25:50.341 --> 25:52.551
Booze sales are up, though.
Am I reading this right?

25:52.635 --> 25:54.428
Yeah, Terrence,
but it's crazy fruity stuff:

25:54.512 --> 25:56.514
banana daiquiris,
mai tais, pink squirrels.

25:56.514 --> 25:57.890
- Those are drinks?
- And they all want

25:57.974 --> 25:59.558
those tiny little umbrellas
stuck in them.

25:59.642 --> 26:02.561
Over my dead body am I buying
tiny little umbrellas

26:02.645 --> 26:04.730
and a feminine
product dispenser.

26:04.814 --> 26:06.524
- They got those?
- Sure, they do.

26:06.524 --> 26:09.151
Geez, so classy.
It'll be like the Frick museum.

26:09.235 --> 26:11.070
Well, receipts are up.

26:11.070 --> 26:13.155
That's what I'm seeing--
across the board.

26:13.239 --> 26:16.367
So I say, if we're raking in
simoleons, we stick to the path.

26:16.367 --> 26:18.577
- What path?
- Order the tiny umbrellas.

26:18.661 --> 26:20.246
And the feminine dispenser.

26:20.246 --> 26:22.456
I want our customers dispensed
while they're here.

26:22.540 --> 26:24.041
And keep doing your act.

26:24.125 --> 26:26.585
Just like you're doing it.
'Cause we'll have both:

26:26.669 --> 26:29.213
gentlemen's entertainment
and a funny girl comic.

26:29.297 --> 26:31.090
- Let's call it a night.
- Hold on a second.

26:31.090 --> 26:33.217
Sounds to me like it's time
to give my girl

26:33.301 --> 26:35.386
- a cut of the bar tab.
- N-No way.

26:35.386 --> 26:37.346
Then I'll book her somewhere
else, take the audience with us.

26:37.430 --> 26:39.223
We have a contract.
Remember the contract?

26:39.307 --> 26:41.309
With an unlicensed,
illegal strip club.

26:41.309 --> 26:43.894
Whoa, everybody calm down. Jesus.

26:43.978 --> 26:45.896
He's tough.
He should work the door.

26:45.980 --> 26:48.232
Uh, we'll discuss
a cut of the bar tomorrow.

26:48.316 --> 26:50.234
- Let's do it now.
- I'm tired.

26:50.318 --> 26:52.320
I want to go home
and watch Gordon Ford.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.030
Eddie Fisher's
going to explain himself.

26:54.030 --> 26:55.865
Oh, shit. I want to watch
Gordon Ford, too.

26:55.865 --> 26:57.825
So, tomorrow. Good night, all.

27:00.202 --> 27:01.245
Will you go home?

27:01.329 --> 27:04.248
How about a couple of
banana daiquiris, Kenny?

27:05.499 --> 27:07.209
Ladies.

27:08.961 --> 27:10.129
Ooh!

27:14.425 --> 27:16.510
Got it, Zelda.

27:17.762 --> 27:19.513
I'm sorry about the fridge.

27:19.597 --> 27:21.223
Please don't be mad
at me forever.

27:21.307 --> 27:23.309
I'll try. I will try.

27:24.435 --> 27:26.395
Hello?

27:26.479 --> 27:27.980
Hi. Miriam Maisel?

27:28.064 --> 27:29.190
That's me.

27:29.190 --> 27:30.733
You sound funny.

27:30.733 --> 27:32.193
- Pardon me?
- <i>Oh, I'm sorry.</i>

27:32.193 --> 27:33.736
I'm Dinah, Susie's secretary.

27:33.736 --> 27:35.196
I was just saying that
I think you're gonna be

27:35.196 --> 27:36.405
a huge star
'cause you sound funny.

27:36.489 --> 27:38.199
Well, thank you, Dinah.

27:38.199 --> 27:39.784
- <i>Hold for Susie?</i>
- You got it.

27:39.784 --> 27:42.370
Susie, Miriam Maisel
on line one.

27:45.498 --> 27:46.916
Nothing's flashing.

27:46.916 --> 27:48.918
I think the hold button's
broken.

27:48.918 --> 27:50.836
Well, put her through,
but call someone

27:50.920 --> 27:52.463
and have 'em fix
the hold button.

27:52.463 --> 27:53.672
We've only got one line.

27:53.756 --> 27:55.508
I can't call someone
while you're on the line.

27:55.508 --> 27:56.926
Just put her through!

27:56.926 --> 27:58.469
- Hello?
- <i>Hey. Listen.</i>

27:58.469 --> 27:59.887
I wanted you to hear it from me,

27:59.887 --> 28:01.305
not one of the dopes
at the deli.

28:01.389 --> 28:02.848
<i>Hear what?</i>

28:02.932 --> 28:04.683
L. Roy Dunham struck again.

28:04.767 --> 28:07.019
<i>He caught your show
at the Wolford Thursday night,</i>

28:07.103 --> 28:08.687
<i>and he wrote about it.</i>

28:08.771 --> 28:10.106
It's pretty brutal.
Don't read it.

28:10.106 --> 28:11.774
But that was a great show.

28:11.774 --> 28:13.317
<i>I know. He'll move on.</i>

28:13.401 --> 28:16.487
Something else will send him
slithering in another direction.

28:16.487 --> 28:18.739
When? When will he stop?
It's been months.

28:18.823 --> 28:20.574
I don't know. Forget him.

28:20.658 --> 28:22.576
The audience loves you.
That's all that matters.

28:22.660 --> 28:24.662
Yeah, you're right.

28:24.662 --> 28:27.164
The show was good.
The audience was good.

28:27.248 --> 28:29.375
Everything's good.

28:40.719 --> 28:42.847
Hi. I'm looking
for L. Roy Dunham.

28:42.847 --> 28:45.724
- And you are?
- Miriam Weissman.

28:45.808 --> 28:47.726
Miriam Weissman.

28:47.810 --> 28:49.645
- So, two S's?
- Yes.

28:49.645 --> 28:51.897
- Great. Wait here.
- Thank you.

29:04.118 --> 29:05.494
Mrs. Maisel.

29:06.495 --> 29:08.414
L. Roy Dunham.

29:08.414 --> 29:10.082
Nice to finally meet you.

29:10.166 --> 29:12.668
You smell good in person.
Is that Arpège?

29:14.420 --> 29:15.963
I don't understand. You're...

29:15.963 --> 29:17.381
- L. Roy Dunham.
- You?

29:17.465 --> 29:18.674
- Me.
- You're the one

29:18.674 --> 29:20.009
who's been writing
all those terrible articles?

29:20.009 --> 29:22.720
Actually, I think
they're pretty good, but yes.

29:22.720 --> 29:26.056
- But... you're a woman.
- What?

29:26.140 --> 29:28.184
And you've always been a woman.

29:28.184 --> 29:29.768
I have, yes.

29:29.852 --> 29:32.062
Be a better story if I hadn't,
though, right?

29:32.146 --> 29:34.148
So, Mrs. Maisel,
what can I do for you?

29:34.148 --> 29:35.733
You can stop writing about me.

29:35.733 --> 29:37.443
Mm, I don't think so. What else?

29:37.443 --> 29:40.571
Well, you can tell me why you
write all that shit about me.

29:40.571 --> 29:43.157
Oh, there's that classy verbiage
I love so much.

29:43.157 --> 29:46.368
Oh, so I offend you? Is that it?
Don't think I'm ladylike enough?

29:46.452 --> 29:47.745
Would you believe
I just don't find you funny?

29:47.745 --> 29:49.497
I would not,
'cause I'm hilarious.

29:49.497 --> 29:51.790
You just make great copy,
you know?

29:51.874 --> 29:54.877
Don't see a lot of female comics
as it is, but one like you,

29:54.877 --> 29:58.422
looks like you, talks like you,
it kind of writes itself.

29:58.506 --> 30:00.216
- These are hit pieces.
- No!

30:00.216 --> 30:01.800
You called me a slut.

30:01.884 --> 30:03.928
Just implied.
I cleared it with legal.

30:03.928 --> 30:06.931
Wow. You seem
really proud of yourself.

30:06.931 --> 30:08.432
Well, you caught me
on a good day.

30:08.516 --> 30:09.808
I just got the window desk.

30:09.892 --> 30:11.560
Took it from Eddie over there.

30:11.644 --> 30:12.811
Hey, Eddie!

30:12.895 --> 30:14.104
Oh, he's a little sore.

30:14.188 --> 30:16.440
He had this desk for five years,
and he's really good.

30:16.524 --> 30:18.359
You should read his pieces
on government waste

30:18.359 --> 30:21.111
and corruption and cronyis...

30:21.195 --> 30:23.322
Okay. Time to go.

30:23.322 --> 30:25.032
I'm sorry you're upset,

30:25.032 --> 30:27.284
but look at it this way, I'm
keeping your name in the press.

30:27.368 --> 30:30.496
I'm a gin girl, in case you want
to send a thank-you gift.

30:30.496 --> 30:32.623
Okay, go ahead.

30:32.623 --> 30:34.208
Take your best shot.

30:34.208 --> 30:35.793
If you think
you're gonna destroy me

30:35.793 --> 30:37.211
or run me out of the business...

30:37.211 --> 30:38.796
Oh, God, no.
That would be terrible.

30:38.796 --> 30:40.422
I mean, you're a gold mine.

30:40.506 --> 30:41.882
The Sophie Lennon rift was good,

30:41.966 --> 30:44.093
but following it up
with the Shy Baldwin fiasco?

30:44.093 --> 30:46.136
Thank you, seriously.

30:46.220 --> 30:49.765
Do you have any idea how hard
it is to do what I'm doing?

30:49.765 --> 30:52.726
To-to go into these clubs
run by men, dominated by men,

30:52.810 --> 30:55.187
and go up there and try
to make men listen to me?

30:55.271 --> 30:57.231
Of course.
That's why I write about you.

30:57.231 --> 30:59.984
Because when I hand my editor
a piece about you--

30:59.984 --> 31:02.194
the rougher the better--
I get print.

31:02.278 --> 31:03.779
I get placement.
I get this desk.

31:03.779 --> 31:05.573
I'm no longer a skirt.

31:05.573 --> 31:10.286
I mean, hey, it's tough
being a woman in journalism.

31:15.165 --> 31:16.959
Keep up the good work.

31:25.259 --> 31:27.803
So they banned him
from the Paramount lot

31:27.803 --> 31:29.847
for the rest of the summer.

31:29.847 --> 31:32.057
He came in disguise once,

31:32.141 --> 31:34.893
and they booted him out
onto Melrose.

31:36.687 --> 31:39.732
Miss Miriam, your great friend
Sophie Lennon's here.

31:39.732 --> 31:41.025
She's not my great friend.

31:41.025 --> 31:42.443
She just told us
a disgusting story

31:42.443 --> 31:44.445
about Mickey Rooney
and a frozen banana.

31:44.445 --> 31:46.196
Too much funny.

31:46.280 --> 31:47.948
- Isn't that sweet?
- It's so amazing

31:48.032 --> 31:50.576
to have a funny person
like that here in the house.

31:50.576 --> 31:53.412
Yes. Zelda, why don't you
give us the room?

31:53.412 --> 31:55.414
Come on, everybody.

31:55.414 --> 31:56.707
Thank you, Miss Sophie.

31:56.707 --> 31:58.917
No, thank you, Miss Zelda.

31:59.001 --> 32:00.753
- Goodbye, all.
- She's so funny.

32:00.753 --> 32:02.671
Bye-bye.

32:02.755 --> 32:04.256
Oh.

32:04.340 --> 32:07.718
Boy, the rooms you play
are getting smaller by the day.

32:07.718 --> 32:09.303
Goodbye.

32:09.303 --> 32:13.182
You're not just a little bit
curious why I'm here, hmm?

32:13.182 --> 32:15.476
You look thirsty.
Can I get you something?

32:15.476 --> 32:17.978
This is my apartment.
And no, I don't want anything.

32:18.062 --> 32:19.647
Then you can wait
outside, Dawes.

32:19.647 --> 32:20.898
Gladly, ma'am.

32:20.898 --> 32:22.650
- I hate that.
- Let's see.

32:22.650 --> 32:26.820
The last time I saw you,
you were resplendent in red.

32:26.904 --> 32:30.032
And you were gagging from
your epic Broadway choke-fest.

32:30.032 --> 32:31.950
Fine, let's get down to it.

32:33.160 --> 32:34.828
I need your help.

32:34.912 --> 32:36.914
- For what?
- You know what.

32:36.914 --> 32:39.041
I want Susie back as my manager.

32:39.041 --> 32:41.293
- Sophie...
- That woman is the future,

32:41.377 --> 32:44.254
and she makes me feel confident,
and I need her in my corner.

32:44.338 --> 32:47.257
Sophie, I couldn't get Susie
to do that if I tried.

32:47.341 --> 32:49.051
And I am not going to try.

32:49.051 --> 32:50.260
Why?

32:51.303 --> 32:52.721
Why?

32:52.805 --> 32:55.516
Because I hate you. Hate!

32:55.516 --> 32:58.268
With the burning hate
of a thousand suns.

32:58.352 --> 32:59.853
It's a lot of hate, Sophie.

32:59.937 --> 33:03.190
It starts here,
boils here, brews here.

33:03.190 --> 33:05.818
It is a seething, writhing,

33:05.818 --> 33:08.946
lava-spewing volcano of hate.

33:08.946 --> 33:13.242
I really hate you.

33:13.242 --> 33:15.327
You're in financial straits.

33:15.411 --> 33:17.454
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

33:17.538 --> 33:20.791
This... is a charade, hmm?

33:20.791 --> 33:24.962
You are in debt
up to your alabaster tits.

33:24.962 --> 33:26.463
- Missed your calling as a poet.
- Hmm.

33:26.547 --> 33:28.507
- You want me to list off your creditors?
- Sophie...

33:28.507 --> 33:30.634
Your grocer. Your baker.

33:30.718 --> 33:32.469
Your dry cleaner,
he's cut you off

33:32.553 --> 33:35.764
and won't even return
your last batch of clothes.

33:35.848 --> 33:38.100
You owe $30
to the electric company,

33:38.100 --> 33:40.227
20 to gas and water,

33:40.227 --> 33:43.439
200 on your
Bloomingdale's charge.

33:43.439 --> 33:46.316
Your fridge is out, and boy,
is Zelda pissed about that.

33:46.400 --> 33:51.155
But your biggest debt
is to one Moishe Maisel.

33:51.155 --> 33:53.031
That's your father-in-law,
isn't it?

33:53.115 --> 33:55.409
Who told you this? Susie?

33:55.409 --> 33:56.994
Oh, God, no.

33:56.994 --> 33:59.163
My private investigator.

33:59.163 --> 34:01.707
He can find anything on anyone.

34:01.707 --> 34:05.335
And failing that,
he can plant anything on anyone.

34:05.419 --> 34:08.964
But in your case,
there's no planting necessary.

34:08.964 --> 34:11.508
You are a full-blown garden.

34:11.592 --> 34:13.010
Why are you doing this?

34:13.010 --> 34:15.679
Because I have an offer.
Come work on my show.

34:15.763 --> 34:17.181
I'm sorry?

34:17.181 --> 34:19.183
Do the warm-up.
You know what that is, right?

34:19.183 --> 34:20.809
You are deranged.

34:20.893 --> 34:22.311
You come out
before the broadcast,

34:22.311 --> 34:24.605
you greet the audience,
you give them the rules,

34:24.605 --> 34:26.231
tell a couple of jokes.

34:26.315 --> 34:28.192
Sometimes
you throw candy at them.

34:28.192 --> 34:30.110
- No way.
- It's easy.

34:30.194 --> 34:31.904
They're there to laugh
and get out of the heat,

34:31.904 --> 34:33.697
and I keep that studio cold.

34:33.781 --> 34:36.450
The hours are minimal, and it's
a quick subway ride away.

34:36.450 --> 34:39.578
And the money...
you will be paid a lot of money.

34:39.578 --> 34:42.331
Too much money.
I'll see to that.

34:42.331 --> 34:45.459
And how could this possibly
help you fix things with Susie?

34:45.459 --> 34:50.047
My only chance at getting
her back is through you.

34:50.047 --> 34:52.257
If we get along,
Susie will calm down,

34:52.341 --> 34:54.009
and then she'll come
be my manager.

34:54.009 --> 34:55.511
I would never work for you.

34:55.511 --> 34:57.805
You won't be.
You'll be working for NBC.

34:57.805 --> 35:00.432
And the best part?
You won't have to see me.

35:00.516 --> 35:04.353
You'll perform, you'll leave,
and then I come on.

35:04.353 --> 35:06.021
And that's the way it'll be.

35:06.021 --> 35:09.399
And in a year, maybe less,
you'll be debt-free.

35:09.483 --> 35:10.984
I'll even throw in a fridge.

35:12.277 --> 35:15.864
And I'll muzzle that
L. Roy Dunham for you, too.

35:15.948 --> 35:18.534
That bitch needs a comeuppance.

35:19.993 --> 35:23.664
Women should help
each other out, don't you think?

35:45.853 --> 35:47.604
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

35:47.688 --> 35:49.064
We had dinner down the block.

35:49.064 --> 35:51.400
I came ahead to make sure
everything was ready.

35:51.400 --> 35:53.652
- He may have hit a bar.
- A bar?

35:53.652 --> 35:55.404
Is this guy a drunk?

35:55.404 --> 35:57.155
Let me use your phone.

35:57.239 --> 35:59.074
I shouldn't have let him
out of my sight.

35:59.074 --> 36:01.577
Did I let you talk me
into booking a drunk magician?

36:01.577 --> 36:03.412
I don't even know
who the fuck to call.

36:03.412 --> 36:05.205
'Cause I'm all for
a magician disappearing

36:05.289 --> 36:06.999
but not before he goes onstage.

36:06.999 --> 36:08.417
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:08.417 --> 36:09.710
Why are you still here?

36:09.710 --> 36:11.044
You're supposed to be
on a train.

36:11.128 --> 36:12.629
I know. Can we talk?

36:12.713 --> 36:13.922
What's wrong?

36:14.006 --> 36:15.799
- Office.
- Sure.

36:17.050 --> 36:18.969
Be right back.

36:18.969 --> 36:21.763
Oh, sure, and it's my pleasure
to hang up the phone for you.

36:25.726 --> 36:27.352
I never should've
booked this guy.

36:27.436 --> 36:28.687
Sight unseen, I did it.

36:28.687 --> 36:29.938
I'm an idiot.

36:30.022 --> 36:31.773
Well, I'm pregnant.

36:33.275 --> 36:35.152
Did you ask me
what I wanted to talk about?

36:35.152 --> 36:36.320
No.

36:36.320 --> 36:37.696
Oh, okay. I wanted to talk

36:37.696 --> 36:39.364
about the fact
that I'm pregnant.

36:39.448 --> 36:41.450
- When you're ready.
- You're pregnant?

36:41.450 --> 36:42.951
- Yes.
- You're sure?

36:43.035 --> 36:44.620
- Yes.
- You're <i>sure</i> sure?

36:44.620 --> 36:46.622
Joel, there's a custom
in my culture.

36:46.622 --> 36:49.249
It's an ironclad, foolproof way
to tell if a woman's pregnant.

36:49.333 --> 36:51.919
- What is it?
- It's taking a damn test at a doctor's office.

36:51.919 --> 36:54.004
- I'm sure.
- Shit.

36:55.714 --> 36:58.342
- Shit.
- Uh-huh. My first words, too.

36:58.342 --> 37:00.427
So we're on the same page there.
That's good.

37:00.427 --> 37:01.929
This is my fault.

37:01.929 --> 37:03.597
- I know better.
- So do I.

37:03.597 --> 37:05.515
- I mean, I'm gonna be a doctor.
- I know.

37:05.599 --> 37:07.434
- I'm on a path, you know?
- Yes, I know.

37:07.434 --> 37:09.102
- I'm gonna be a doctor.
- I know.

37:09.186 --> 37:10.729
I'm gonna be a doctor.

37:10.729 --> 37:11.730
I know. I heard you.

37:11.730 --> 37:13.565
I'm gonna be a doctor!

37:13.649 --> 37:14.983
I know you're gonna be a doctor.

37:15.067 --> 37:16.568
Why do you keep saying
you're gonna be a doctor?

37:16.652 --> 37:19.196
I'm not saying it to you.
I'm saying it to me.

37:19.196 --> 37:22.157
You have to say it over
and over and over at first

37:22.157 --> 37:24.159
so you know
the other person heard you,

37:24.159 --> 37:26.411
and then again and again
to remind yourself

37:26.495 --> 37:28.497
that you're actually
gonna be a doctor,

37:28.497 --> 37:31.041
and then over and over
so you remember

37:31.041 --> 37:33.502
you're gonna be a doctor
and you don't forget

37:33.502 --> 37:36.505
and you don't lose focus
and you don't get pregnant!

37:36.505 --> 37:38.840
- Mei...
- I go to bed saying I'm gonna be a doctor.

37:38.924 --> 37:40.676
I wake up saying
I'm gonna be a doctor.

37:40.676 --> 37:42.678
I know.
I've woken up next to you.

37:42.678 --> 37:44.429
You're gonna be a doctor.
It's a done deal.

37:44.513 --> 37:45.847
You got a residency
interview tomorrow.

37:45.931 --> 37:47.265
- It's gonna happen.
- Oh, my God.

37:47.349 --> 37:48.976
I've got a residency
interview tomorrow.

37:48.976 --> 37:50.978
- Go. Get on a train.
- But I'm pregnant.

37:50.978 --> 37:52.604
- I think it's safe.
- There's jostling.

37:52.688 --> 37:55.691
Mei, we'll figure it out.
We've got time.

37:55.691 --> 37:57.693
I've fucked up
a lot of things in my life.

37:57.693 --> 38:00.320
I'm not gonna fuck this up, too.
Let me get you a taxi.

38:00.404 --> 38:01.697
I've got one outside.

38:01.697 --> 38:03.407
Then go.

38:06.243 --> 38:08.245
And call me from the station.

38:08.245 --> 38:10.288
And as soon
as you get to Chicago.

38:10.372 --> 38:12.541
And when you get to your hotel.
And when...

38:12.541 --> 38:14.668
I'll call a lot. I promise.

38:16.128 --> 38:17.879
You're gonna be a doctor.

39:10.265 --> 39:11.933
Alfie.

39:12.017 --> 39:13.602
You're very mad at me.

39:13.602 --> 39:16.021
I've been looking all over for you.

39:16.021 --> 39:17.564
That is not a spice.

39:17.564 --> 39:19.357
I may have just
snorted gunpowder.

39:19.441 --> 39:21.902
Goddamn, Alfie, there's a room
full of people waiting for you.

39:21.902 --> 39:24.071
- I am aware.
- But you don't give a shit?

39:24.071 --> 39:26.114
I didn't say that.

39:26.198 --> 39:28.200
- You been drinking?
- I thought about it.

39:28.200 --> 39:29.910
So you're just doing
a little shopping.

39:29.910 --> 39:31.536
Getting a jump on Christmas?

39:31.620 --> 39:34.581
You know, it was just about
20 years ago to the day

39:34.581 --> 39:37.459
that I won the
<i>Major Bowes Amateur Hour.</i>

39:37.459 --> 39:39.586
- I was 12.
- Impressive.

39:39.586 --> 39:41.463
Orson Welles took me to lunch.

39:41.463 --> 39:43.090
He ordered for both of us.

39:43.090 --> 39:45.842
Then he asked
a very pertinent question:

39:45.926 --> 39:49.221
"What does it mean for
a magician to perform on radio?"

39:49.221 --> 39:52.099
- That's a pretty good question.
- And then he ate both lunches.

39:52.099 --> 39:53.600
Sounds like Orson.

39:53.600 --> 39:55.602
When he finished,
he went to the john

39:55.602 --> 39:58.605
and I drank his martini,
and I liked it.

39:58.605 --> 40:01.191
It was like punch
but with that terrific snap.

40:01.191 --> 40:03.235
Can't guess what this is.
I'm buying it.

40:03.235 --> 40:04.903
Alfie, do not do
what you're doing.

40:04.903 --> 40:07.197
- What am I doing?
- You're talking yourself out of it.

40:07.197 --> 40:08.615
Am I?

40:08.615 --> 40:10.325
You are the best I've seen.

40:10.325 --> 40:12.410
You are not a hack.
You're special.

40:12.494 --> 40:13.745
I really believe that.

40:13.829 --> 40:15.372
You can do this.
Let me help you.

40:15.372 --> 40:18.041
I don't know. I just feel...

40:18.125 --> 40:19.709
What? What do you feel?

40:19.793 --> 40:21.211
Everything.

40:22.671 --> 40:24.464
I got a good eye, Alfie.

40:24.548 --> 40:26.758
You are client number two
of what's gonna be a roster

40:26.842 --> 40:28.426
of groundbreaking
fucking clients,

40:28.510 --> 40:30.095
so I am not giving up on you.

40:30.095 --> 40:32.681
Lost causes--
is that your specialty?

40:32.681 --> 40:34.808
I don't know.
Ask Sigmund fucking Freud.

40:34.808 --> 40:36.643
I can, you know.
I talk to the dead.

40:36.643 --> 40:38.979
Fine. Tell Siggie to watch you,
because goddamn it,

40:38.979 --> 40:41.439
you are getting back up there,
because if you are gonna fail,

40:41.523 --> 40:42.899
you're gonna fail
with an audience

40:42.983 --> 40:44.693
and you are gonna fail spectacularly.

40:44.693 --> 40:46.778
- Is this a pep talk?
- Hell yes.

40:46.862 --> 40:48.572
It's using
the word "fail" a lot.

40:48.572 --> 40:50.907
But you get the gist.

40:50.991 --> 40:53.535
Now, you are not
going on tonight.

40:53.535 --> 40:56.079
Hmm? I'm gonna buy that thing
for you that you want,

40:56.163 --> 40:58.206
and you're gonna go home
and play with it,

40:58.290 --> 41:00.083
and once it breaks,
'cause all this shit in here

41:00.167 --> 41:02.752
lasts like a minute,
you are gonna start practicing

41:02.836 --> 41:04.671
for the new gig I am booking
for you tomorrow.

41:04.671 --> 41:06.631
That man at the club
will be very upset.

41:06.715 --> 41:08.175
He's not a man. He's Joel.

41:08.175 --> 41:10.010
I'll deal with him.

41:10.010 --> 41:12.387
Just don't drink. Okay?

41:12.387 --> 41:14.181
Because you are
the lousiest, sloppiest

41:14.181 --> 41:16.725
fucking drunk I've ever met.

41:16.725 --> 41:18.602
Now, where's
that thing you want?

41:18.602 --> 41:20.353
It's in your pocket.

41:23.481 --> 41:26.276
Motherfuck, you are good.

41:38.705 --> 41:40.707
I'm trying to get the fuck
away from her.

41:40.707 --> 41:43.418
- I know.
- This is not getting the fuck away from her.

41:43.418 --> 41:45.629
It's money.
It's anonymous money.

41:45.629 --> 41:47.172
She's an evil genius.

41:47.172 --> 41:50.008
Patricia Highsmith modeled every
psycho in every book after her.

41:50.008 --> 41:51.927
I need the cash.
I need a fridge.

41:51.927 --> 41:53.553
She sent me luggage and a car.

41:53.637 --> 41:55.055
It's local. No travel.

41:55.055 --> 41:58.225
No? Too bad, 'cause I have
luggage and a car you could use.

42:02.979 --> 42:04.564
Susie?

42:04.648 --> 42:06.066
These are housewives.

42:06.066 --> 42:08.109
- You can't say "tits."
- I won't say "tits."

42:08.193 --> 42:10.111
You think you can do this
without saying "tits"?

42:10.195 --> 42:11.404
I think I can.

42:11.488 --> 42:13.114
Fuck!

42:19.663 --> 42:21.373
She had sex with Cubby O'Brien.

42:21.373 --> 42:23.375
So? Wait, what?

42:23.375 --> 42:25.335
The Mouseketeer?
I don't believe that.

42:25.335 --> 42:26.670
You really want to work
for a woman

42:26.670 --> 42:28.088
who defiled
America's sweetheart?

42:28.088 --> 42:30.548
I don't think Cubby O'Brien
is America's sweetheart.

42:30.632 --> 42:33.927
America loves goddamn
Cubby O'Brien, Miriam! Wake up!

42:36.554 --> 42:37.681
Fuck!

42:43.353 --> 42:45.397
Mrs. Weissman, follow me.

42:58.827 --> 43:00.745
- Rose Weissman.
- Hmm.

43:00.829 --> 43:02.789
We finally meet face-to-face.

43:02.789 --> 43:04.332
You find the place okay?

43:04.416 --> 43:05.959
I did. It's lovely.

43:05.959 --> 43:07.752
I've never been
to Brighton Beach before.

43:07.836 --> 43:09.879
- It feels like such a treat.
- Please sit.

43:13.049 --> 43:14.384
I'm Benedetta.

43:14.384 --> 43:15.802
Benedetta...?

43:15.802 --> 43:17.887
- No last names.
- Oh, yes.

43:17.971 --> 43:19.681
You know my last name, though.

43:19.681 --> 43:21.099
- I'm Gitta.
- Molly.

43:21.099 --> 43:23.143
- Miss Em.
- Well, nice to meet you all.

43:23.143 --> 43:24.769
Is this the whole group?

43:24.853 --> 43:26.438
You drink sherry,
don't you, Rose?

43:26.438 --> 43:28.481
I do. I mean,
not during the day.

43:28.565 --> 43:30.442
Oh. Thank you.

43:32.902 --> 43:35.613
I just have to say
I think it's a wonderful idea

43:35.697 --> 43:37.657
to have a Small Business
Women's Council.

43:37.741 --> 43:40.577
Women coming together
to share a common purpose.

43:40.577 --> 43:42.162
It's like the Girl Scouts

43:42.162 --> 43:44.039
without the annoying
camping element.

43:44.039 --> 43:46.207
Ooh, the herring is
so nice today.

43:46.291 --> 43:49.377
So tell me, Benedetta,
what exactly is your business?

43:49.461 --> 43:51.171
Me? Oh, I help people.

43:51.171 --> 43:52.297
So noble.

43:52.297 --> 43:53.590
I help them find each other.

43:53.590 --> 43:54.966
I help them fall in love.

43:55.050 --> 43:56.217
I help them get married.

43:56.301 --> 43:58.136
You sound like a matchmaker.

43:59.220 --> 44:01.139
Miss Em, what is your business?

44:01.139 --> 44:05.643
Well, I am what I like to call
a matrimonial matron.

44:05.727 --> 44:07.896
Otherwise known as a matchmaker.

44:07.896 --> 44:09.647
Gitta,
what about you?

44:09.731 --> 44:11.399
Matchmaker. Pass the mustard.

44:11.483 --> 44:13.151
- Molly?
- I am a nurse part-time,

44:13.151 --> 44:15.153
and I teach clogging
on the weekends.

44:15.153 --> 44:16.863
I'm kidding.

44:16.863 --> 44:18.198
I'm a matchmaker.

44:18.198 --> 44:19.699
What about you, Rose Weissman?

44:19.783 --> 44:21.785
Well, I'm also a matchmaker.

44:21.785 --> 44:25.038
And how long have you been
a matchmaker, Rose Weissman?

44:25.038 --> 44:26.289
You know, "Rose" is fine.

44:26.373 --> 44:28.333
Rose Weissman has not
answered my question.

44:28.333 --> 44:30.418
And she also hasn't
passed the mustard.

44:30.502 --> 44:33.630
Well, I'm relatively new
to the game. A few months.

44:33.630 --> 44:35.090
You seem to be doing
very well for yourself

44:35.090 --> 44:36.174
in such a short time.

44:36.174 --> 44:37.550
- Beginner's luck.
- Uh-huh.

44:37.634 --> 44:39.677
Have you ever seen a dog
try to eat the kibble

44:39.761 --> 44:41.388
out of another dog's dish,
Rose Weissman?

44:41.388 --> 44:43.264
- Thankfully, no.
- It's ugly.

44:43.348 --> 44:45.683
- Very ugly.
- A dog has one dish.

44:45.767 --> 44:47.560
He shouldn't have to share
his kibble with anyone.

44:47.644 --> 44:49.729
Ladies, I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

44:49.813 --> 44:51.648
So you're not working
as a matchmaker?

44:51.648 --> 44:52.982
Well, yes, I am.

44:53.066 --> 44:54.734
But I assure you
I'm not trying to eat

44:54.818 --> 44:56.611
the kibble out of anyone's dish.

44:56.611 --> 44:58.530
You bagged the Melamid girls.

44:58.530 --> 45:01.116
- Melamid's my territory.
- I don't understand.

45:01.116 --> 45:03.326
Manhattan is divided up
into territories.

45:03.410 --> 45:05.328
It's the only way to keep
the peace after the wars.

45:05.412 --> 45:06.496
The wars?

45:06.496 --> 45:09.082
You don't want to know
about the wars.

45:09.082 --> 45:11.126
Lost a lot of good ladies
in the wars.

45:11.126 --> 45:15.296
However, once everyone got
their piece, the wars stopped.

45:15.380 --> 45:17.173
Now we each have our territory.

45:17.257 --> 45:19.134
Little Italy, Lower East Side.

45:19.134 --> 45:21.886
Upper Manhattan, Harlem,
Washington Heights.

45:21.970 --> 45:23.847
West End, Midtown,
Hell's Kitchen.

45:23.847 --> 45:25.974
Jews are everywhere,
but I stick to the Jews,

45:25.974 --> 45:27.600
and Melamid's a Jew.

45:27.684 --> 45:30.812
Well, I'm sorry. I didn't know
about the territories.

45:30.812 --> 45:33.148
- You got our letter, didn't you?
- What letter?

45:33.148 --> 45:34.232
The letter that you ignored.

45:34.232 --> 45:35.817
The one that said "stop."

45:35.817 --> 45:37.819
Oh, that letter.

45:37.819 --> 45:39.946
Yes, I did get it.

45:39.946 --> 45:41.531
I just didn't understand it.

45:41.531 --> 45:42.907
You didn't understand "stop"?

45:42.991 --> 45:44.742
- It's one word.
- What are you, an idiot?

45:44.826 --> 45:46.327
No. I understand it now.

45:46.411 --> 45:47.328
Good.

45:47.412 --> 45:48.663
But, ladies, really,

45:48.663 --> 45:50.540
New York is such a big city.

45:50.540 --> 45:52.834
Surely, there's enough business
to go around.

45:52.834 --> 45:55.170
I don't think
you've been listening to us.

45:55.170 --> 45:56.921
You are not welcome.

45:57.005 --> 45:58.423
You are intruding.

45:58.423 --> 46:02.051
You are competition
that we do not need or want.

46:02.135 --> 46:04.471
Now, we are ladies,
and as ladies,

46:04.471 --> 46:06.264
we wanted to give you a chance.

46:06.264 --> 46:08.057
If you had pulled this stunt
out in Staten Island,

46:08.141 --> 46:09.767
all that would've
been left of you is that hat.

46:09.851 --> 46:11.561
And I don't want to tell you

46:11.561 --> 46:13.605
what they would've done
to the hat.

46:13.605 --> 46:16.900
We can make this very, very ugly
for you if we choose to.

46:16.900 --> 46:18.401
What are you saying?

46:18.485 --> 46:20.403
For starters,
we know about your daughter

46:20.487 --> 46:21.821
and that nudie show.

46:21.905 --> 46:23.656
Mr. Melamid would not approve.

46:23.740 --> 46:26.034
None of your other clients
would, either.

46:26.034 --> 46:28.953
What my daughter does has
nothing to do with my business.

46:29.037 --> 46:30.538
Business?

46:30.622 --> 46:32.582
What do you know about business?

46:32.582 --> 46:34.417
Matchmaking isn't a business.

46:34.501 --> 46:37.337
It's a tradition
going back decades, centuries.

46:37.337 --> 46:40.048
My family has been
pairing up Harlem

46:40.048 --> 46:42.175
since Harlem had two A's in it.

46:42.175 --> 46:43.259
You got to stop.

46:43.343 --> 46:44.302
- Stop.
- Stop.

46:44.302 --> 46:46.554
- Stop and pass the salt.
- Are we clear?

46:48.389 --> 46:50.225
Good.

46:51.267 --> 46:52.727
Now...

46:52.727 --> 46:53.853
shall we eat?

46:53.937 --> 46:54.979
Mm.

46:55.063 --> 46:56.439
The cutlets here are so thin.

46:56.523 --> 46:58.441
And crispy.

46:58.525 --> 47:01.319
That is a lovely hat,
by the way.

47:02.737 --> 47:04.239
It's a good
audience today.

47:04.239 --> 47:06.616
Mostly tourists, a few locals,
couple of nuns. The usual.

47:06.616 --> 47:08.284
I'll try not
to insult the pope.

47:08.368 --> 47:09.661
Crowd work's
always good.

47:09.661 --> 47:11.496
They love it,
so feel free to interact.

47:11.496 --> 47:12.997
And at some point,
we'll be throwing

47:13.081 --> 47:14.999
game-branded pot holders out
to everybody.

47:15.083 --> 47:17.085
- They love pot holders.
- As do I.

47:17.085 --> 47:18.795
Just keep in mind
that the one thing

47:18.795 --> 47:20.171
everyone out there has in common

47:20.255 --> 47:22.340
is the thing we all have
in common: we love Sophie.

47:22.340 --> 47:23.841
Sorry.

47:23.925 --> 47:26.177
- Yes. We love Sophie.
- Ten seconds to warm-up!

47:26.261 --> 47:29.138
Okay, looks like we're ready.
Go out there and have fun.

47:29.222 --> 47:30.848
I'm gonna wander around
a little.

47:30.932 --> 47:32.850
Break a leg.
Better yet, break Sophie's.

47:32.934 --> 47:35.144
Go on. I'll see you later.

47:36.980 --> 47:39.190
Good afternoon, everyone.

47:40.483 --> 47:43.069
You ready to see <i>Seconds Count!</i>
with Sophie Lennon?

47:45.780 --> 47:47.740
That's too bad,
because this is a cooking show.

47:47.824 --> 47:50.118
Who likes salmon casserole?

47:50.118 --> 47:52.453
No, no,
you're in the right place.

47:52.537 --> 47:54.581
So, a couple of things
to keep in mind today.

47:54.581 --> 47:58.293
No smoking, no snacking,
and when that red light goes on,

47:58.293 --> 48:00.169
it means the Russians
are invading.

48:00.253 --> 48:02.630
Or we're rolling. One of the two.

48:02.714 --> 48:04.340
Both are pretty exciting.

48:04.424 --> 48:06.301
And when Sophie comes out,
I'm gonna need you

48:06.301 --> 48:08.136
to yell like
your hair's on fire.

48:08.136 --> 48:10.263
And if at any point
your hair really is on fire,

48:10.263 --> 48:12.181
the exits are there and there.

48:13.808 --> 48:17.228
Boy, good-looking crowd today.

48:17.312 --> 48:18.813
You two look like
you're in love.

48:18.813 --> 48:20.607
- Am I wrong?
- We're engaged.

48:20.607 --> 48:22.150
Aw.

48:22.150 --> 48:23.985
Exciting.

48:23.985 --> 48:25.862
And do you want kids right away?

48:25.862 --> 48:27.780
- Uh, uh, I think so.
- Yes.

48:27.864 --> 48:29.282
Great. Well,
I've got two for you.

48:29.282 --> 48:30.617
Their names are
Ethan and Esther.

48:30.617 --> 48:32.201
I'll have them bathed
and delivered to you.

48:32.285 --> 48:33.745
Just feed and water them regularly.

48:33.745 --> 48:35.955
Nice doing business with you.

48:40.877 --> 48:43.421
Hi there. Susie Myerson,
talent manager.

48:43.421 --> 48:45.548
Just dropping by
to say hello to Mike Carr.

48:45.632 --> 48:47.550
Following up on a lunch
from a couple weeks ago.

48:47.634 --> 48:49.927
- You on the list?
- Sure. Who do I see about the list?

48:50.011 --> 48:52.055
Me. Your name's Susie Myerson?

48:52.055 --> 48:55.224
Actually, it's, uh...
Carol Jacobson.

48:55.308 --> 48:58.019
- Yep. There I am.
- So you're Gordon's stepmother?

48:58.019 --> 48:59.812
Yep. Love him like my own.

48:59.896 --> 49:01.564
Keep walking.

49:01.648 --> 49:03.983
It's always "keep walking"
with these people.

49:07.779 --> 49:08.946
So I'm getting the sense that

49:09.030 --> 49:10.615
a lot of you are
from out of town.

49:10.615 --> 49:12.784
Let's see a show of hands.
Come on.

49:12.784 --> 49:16.371
And how many of you are toting
New York City guidebooks?

49:16.371 --> 49:17.664
Some of you have 'em.

49:17.664 --> 49:19.415
Fess up. Uh-huh.

49:19.499 --> 49:21.042
Let me see that.

49:21.042 --> 49:23.086
You know, this is the only place
in the world where you can see

49:23.086 --> 49:24.879
a Broadway musical,
a game show and a mugging

49:24.879 --> 49:26.422
all in one day.

49:26.506 --> 49:28.007
Let's see. Says here,

49:28.091 --> 49:31.386
"For your own safety,
try not to look like a tourist."

49:31.386 --> 49:34.055
Which is tough when
you're carrying a guidebook.

49:34.055 --> 49:36.766
I guess they just want you to
look like a very stupid local.

49:36.766 --> 49:38.685
What's with the laughs?

49:38.685 --> 49:40.228
It's your girl. She's good.

49:40.228 --> 49:41.729
Very good. Crowd loves her.

49:41.813 --> 49:43.272
Oh, good.

49:43.356 --> 49:45.149
It's going to work.

49:47.110 --> 49:48.528
...walk around
with a hobo stick

49:48.528 --> 49:50.154
and a half-drunk bottle
of Canadian Club,

49:50.238 --> 49:52.156
and no one will come
within a mile of you.

49:52.240 --> 49:54.575
She's so funny!

49:54.659 --> 49:56.661
She's a riot.

49:56.661 --> 50:00.415
"Coney Island: a great
spot to visit for a day trip."

50:00.415 --> 50:03.710
"New Yorkers walk quickly,
so consider picking up the pace

50:03.710 --> 50:05.837
so you don't annoy the locals."

50:05.837 --> 50:07.880
The other good way
not to annoy the locals?

50:07.964 --> 50:11.092
Leave town.

50:11.092 --> 50:13.010
Whoa. Was it that funny?

50:13.094 --> 50:15.221
No, but I am.

50:19.142 --> 50:21.686
Sophie, hello.

50:21.686 --> 50:24.147
- Is the show starting?
- Oh, in a few minutes.

50:24.147 --> 50:25.898
I just thought I'd come out here

50:25.982 --> 50:29.318
and say hi
to these beautiful people.

50:29.402 --> 50:31.154
Aw.

50:31.154 --> 50:34.031
Oh, sounds like you're done
with the appetizer

50:34.115 --> 50:36.409
and want to get
to the entrée, huh?

50:36.409 --> 50:37.994
Good deal, Sophie, but you know,

50:37.994 --> 50:39.579
rushing a meal
could give you gas.

50:41.289 --> 50:45.752
Not unless the appetizer's rich,
so we're fine.

50:45.752 --> 50:48.588
Let's take a poll, huh?
You want me to leave?

50:48.588 --> 50:50.339
No!

50:50.423 --> 50:52.341
The people have spoken.

50:52.425 --> 50:54.510
Ah.

50:54.594 --> 50:58.848
Now, let me be
your guide to New York.

50:58.848 --> 51:01.184
Don't bother with lunch
at Tavern on the Green.

51:01.184 --> 51:03.060
You want to get day-drunk
in Central Park,

51:03.144 --> 51:05.104
grab a bottle and meet me
in the Ramble.

51:06.856 --> 51:09.275
My advice? Skip the
horse-and-carriage ride.

51:09.275 --> 51:11.277
If you're looking to get
bounced around while breathing

51:11.277 --> 51:13.237
the smell of manure,
hail one of our cabs.

51:15.198 --> 51:17.200
And you can skip
the carousel in Central Park.

51:17.200 --> 51:19.076
If you want to go around
in circles

51:19.160 --> 51:22.246
with a bunch of idiot children,
come to my writers' room, huh?

51:22.330 --> 51:25.166
And there's no need to schlep to
the Museum of Natural History.

51:25.166 --> 51:26.834
If you want to gawk
at a dinosaur,

51:26.918 --> 51:28.252
you're already
in the right place.

51:28.336 --> 51:29.879
Oh, so funny.

51:29.879 --> 51:33.132
So, so funny.

51:35.802 --> 51:37.678
Mike.

51:37.762 --> 51:40.932
Mike. Mike. Mike. Mike.

51:40.932 --> 51:42.892
Mike. Mike.

51:42.892 --> 51:44.519
- What?
- Susie Myerson.

51:44.519 --> 51:46.562
From the Stage Deli.

51:46.646 --> 51:48.523
- Sophie Lennon?
- Right. How you doing?

51:48.523 --> 51:50.817
The Sophie Lennon thing
went good, you got to admit.

51:50.817 --> 51:52.777
- Gordon was happy.
- So I'm one for one.

51:52.777 --> 51:54.862
Listen, I got a client,
a killer comic.

51:54.946 --> 51:56.739
She is wowing 'em
out there, man.

51:56.823 --> 51:58.491
And Gordon's show is
the perfect place

51:58.491 --> 51:59.951
to break her on national TV.

51:59.951 --> 52:02.078
Thought I'd offer her to you
before I go to Jack Paar.

52:02.078 --> 52:03.871
- Great. What's her gimmick?
- What?

52:03.955 --> 52:05.832
Breakdown? Felony conviction?
Sex triangle?

52:05.832 --> 52:07.792
- She's a comic.
- I don't get it.

52:07.792 --> 52:10.086
- She's just a really good comic.
- Okay.

52:10.086 --> 52:12.421
Guess I can send one of my guys.
Where's she gig?

52:12.505 --> 52:15.341
Oh, she's actually doing warm-up
for Sophie as we speak.

52:15.341 --> 52:16.676
Never mind.

52:16.676 --> 52:18.761
Uh, but her regular gig's
at a place Midtown.

52:18.845 --> 52:21.055
She is selling out the room.
It's big stuff.

52:21.055 --> 52:23.224
- Where, the Latin Quarter? Roxie's?
- No.

52:23.224 --> 52:25.101
- So it's a joint downtown?
- No.

52:25.101 --> 52:28.521
- If you want me to see her, where the fuck can I see her?
- Where?

52:28.521 --> 52:29.939
Where?

52:29.939 --> 52:32.316
I got no fucking place
for you to see her, Mike.

52:38.114 --> 52:39.782
Wow, look at that hairstyle.

52:39.866 --> 52:41.868
Wilt Chamberlain
couldn't see over that thing.

52:43.286 --> 52:46.497
Your hair is so high,
you don't need a hair stylist,

52:46.581 --> 52:49.166
you need an air traffic
controller, huh?

52:49.250 --> 52:51.002
Her hair is so high,

52:51.002 --> 52:53.254
her split ends have
altitude sickness.

52:53.254 --> 52:54.839
Oh. Her hair is higher

52:54.839 --> 52:56.924
than Midge's unpaid
dry cleaning bills.

52:57.008 --> 52:59.760
Her hair is higher
than Sophie's blood pressure.

52:59.844 --> 53:01.679
Her hair is higher
than the pedestal

53:01.679 --> 53:03.222
Midge puts herself on.

53:03.306 --> 53:05.391
Ha! Her hair is higher
than Sophie Lennon

53:05.391 --> 53:06.893
on a Tuesday night.

53:06.893 --> 53:09.729
Hell, Tuesday morning.
Hell, every morning.

53:09.729 --> 53:11.397
Well, how's it going, sir?

53:11.397 --> 53:13.274
- What's your name?
- Ma'am, what's your name?
- Morty.

53:13.274 --> 53:14.775
- Stella.
- Morty, where are you from?
- And where are you from?

53:14.859 --> 53:16.694
- Milwaukee.
- Westport, Connecticut.
- Morty from Milwaukee.

53:16.694 --> 53:18.654
- That's got a nice ring. "Hey.
- Well, it's great to have you here.

53:18.738 --> 53:20.781
- I'm Morty from Milwaukee.
- If I need anything else from you today,

53:20.865 --> 53:23.367
- I'll just call out, "Stella!"
- You know my wife, Patty from Poughkeepsie."

53:23.451 --> 53:25.161
Will you turn my mic up, fellas?

53:25.161 --> 53:27.079
Mine, too, fellas. Trying
to reach the back row here.

53:27.163 --> 53:28.748
Stella, would you like
my autograph?

53:28.748 --> 53:30.124
Be happy to give you one.

53:30.124 --> 53:31.626
Or an incurable venereal disease

53:31.626 --> 53:33.085
not seen since
the days of Columbus?

53:33.169 --> 53:34.587
She'd be happy
to give you that, too.

53:34.587 --> 53:36.047
Watch your tongue here, dear.

53:36.047 --> 53:38.341
We're not in that sleazy
grind joint you work in.

53:38.341 --> 53:40.635
Correct. We're on the set
of a game show.

53:40.635 --> 53:42.803
Such a nice place
for an over-the-hill comedian

53:42.887 --> 53:44.597
to live out her twilight years.

53:44.597 --> 53:46.891
And what a game show.

53:46.891 --> 53:49.894
Another poll.

53:49.894 --> 53:52.897
Who loves <i>Seconds Count!?</i>

53:55.650 --> 53:59.278
Seconds count, like when
you're defusing a bomb.

53:59.362 --> 54:02.031
Which makes sense, since half
of Sophie's jokes are bombs.

54:02.031 --> 54:05.368
Or like when you're pulling
the cord on a parachute.

54:05.368 --> 54:07.703
Did you have to do that
when Shy Baldwin

54:07.787 --> 54:10.081
kicked your ass off his plane?

54:10.081 --> 54:11.832
I get the laxative
commercials now, Sophie.

54:11.916 --> 54:13.918
Perfect for someone
so full of shit.

54:13.918 --> 54:15.544
All righty, folks!

54:15.628 --> 54:18.297
Who wants a free pot holder?
