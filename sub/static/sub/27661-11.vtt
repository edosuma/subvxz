a little visitor.

01:07.631 --> 01:09.714

I had to bring her.

01:09.756 --> 01:12.422
My mom is in Palm Springs,

01:12.464 --> 01:14.088

- Okay.

01:15.714 --> 01:17.839
I have to say, it's good
to see you all of you here

01:17.881 --> 01:20.297

- Yeah, it feels good.

Oh, like decision time?

be Nathan,

okay?

01:45.172 --> 01:47.172
Nathan, you've been so patient.

01:47.214 --> 01:49.172
And you make my life
so much better.

01:50.714 --> 01:52.714
I just... how do I say it?

01:52.756 --> 01:56.005
I'm... there's something
I need to do first.

01:59.172 --> 02:00.672
someone?

02:00.714 --> 02:02.839

02:18.881 --> 02:20.589
- Try not to guzzle
your dinner tonight.

02:20.631 --> 02:22.047
- Hey, about that.

02:22.088 --> 02:23.881
I wanna make sure that
we are on the same page

02:23.923 --> 02:25.339
for this evening.

02:25.380 --> 02:27.631
- Yep. Brenna's a bad influence,

02:27.672 --> 02:29.714
so her parents are coming over,
and we are going to crush them.

02:29.756 --> 02:31.756
- Totally, totally.

02:31.797 --> 02:33.881
But if I've learned anything,

02:33.923 --> 02:35.547
it's that we need
to adopt the tenets

02:35.589 --> 02:37.547
of conflict resolution.

02:37.589 --> 02:39.714
- There's nothing to resolve.
Their daughter's a problem,

02:39.756 --> 02:42.047
if she can't stop,
Alice can't see her anymore.

02:42.088 --> 02:44.214
- Yes well, obviously we both
know that Brenna's the problem.

02:44.255 --> 02:46.589
But her parents aren't
gonna accept that.

02:46.631 --> 02:49.589
So, we just need to gently
coax them into understanding

02:49.631 --> 02:52.422
that their daughter shares
some of the blame with Alice.

02:52.464 --> 02:54.088
Then we can have an intelligent
conversation,

02:54.130 --> 02:56.297
and both parties
leave satisfied.

02:56.339 --> 02:58.214
- Fine. And then we crush them.

02:58.255 --> 03:00.672
- Yes, like a clove of garlic
in the soup of friendship.

03:08.589 --> 03:10.589
- Hi!
- Hi.

03:10.631 --> 03:12.255
Sit down.

03:14.214 --> 03:15.964
- Okay.

03:17.631 --> 03:20.380
So, what's up?

03:20.422 --> 03:22.589
- Well, I got a call from
head office this morning.

03:22.631 --> 03:24.380
They were going
through payroll,

03:24.422 --> 03:26.839
and found an irregularity,
which I can only assume

03:26.881 --> 03:29.130
was done by you
while I was gone.

03:29.172 --> 03:32.088
Did you hire an...
"offsite business boy?"

03:34.380 --> 03:36.547
- Oh... yes.

03:37.756 --> 03:39.547
I-I needed something done...

03:40.672 --> 03:42.923
offsite.

03:42.964 --> 03:46.172
- Jenny! Paying your ex,
who doesn't work here,

03:46.214 --> 03:49.380
for a job that doesn't exist,
is stealing.

03:49.422 --> 03:51.422
You've stolen
from this company!

03:51.464 --> 03:53.255
- It- it... it's not.

03:54.756 --> 03:56.881
See, the job does exist.

03:56.923 --> 03:58.923
He does valuable stuff.

03:58.964 --> 04:00.714
- Well, if he's so valuable,
why doesn't he come in?

04:00.756 --> 04:03.881
- Well, offsite is just
in his title, so I...

04:03.923 --> 04:08.881
- Jenny, if we're paying him,
he's gotta be here,

04:08.923 --> 04:11.589
working effectively, today.

04:11.631 --> 04:13.505
Or I'm gonna have to let
you go.

04:13.547 --> 04:15.797
- (Groans) I...

04:20.047 --> 04:21.547
(Kate groans)

04:21.589 --> 04:23.547
- Kate! I've been trying
to reach you! Guess who...

04:23.589 --> 04:26.881
- Look at this headline
that just came in!

04:26.923 --> 04:29.130
"Tasteless Campaign
Saves Clinic."

04:29.172 --> 04:30.589
Dana Fuckin' Brown!

04:30.631 --> 04:33.047
- No, no, it's about Tru Air.

04:33.088 --> 04:35.714
They're here for the meeting,
it got pushed up.

04:35.756 --> 04:37.422
- Do you think they've seen
the article?

04:37.464 --> 04:39.130
- So, we read the article.
- Yeah.

04:39.172 --> 04:40.923
- Yeah, about that.
- Yeah, that free bleed thing?

04:40.964 --> 04:42.756
It was pretty sick.

04:42.797 --> 04:44.547
- Yeah, I had to take like,
breaks from reading it.

04:44.589 --> 04:46.505
- The thing is that
the journalist, Dana Brown,

04:46.547 --> 04:48.214
she sort of has it out for me.

04:48.255 --> 04:49.714
- Yeah, she does,
I mean, brutal headline.

04:49.756 --> 04:51.214
- Total click bait.

04:51.255 --> 04:52.964
- Yeah, but then
she completely flips it.

04:53.005 --> 04:54.797
- Flips it? You're saying
it's a good article?

04:56.964 --> 04:58.047
(Aidan and Lisa laugh)

04:58.088 --> 05:00.464
- Uh... (Laughs nervously)

05:00.505 --> 05:04.130
- Kate, we loved
the Free Bleed campaign.

05:04.172 --> 05:06.505
I mean, it was so in your face.

05:06.547 --> 05:09.297
- It was like, raw,
uncooked, deal with it.

05:09.339 --> 05:11.339
- Yeah, when I read it,
I screamed.

05:11.380 --> 05:13.505
Didn't I scream, Aidan?
- She texted me in all caps.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.255
- And so, we want to gauge your
interest about something.

05:15.297 --> 05:16.839
- Gauge away.

05:16.881 --> 05:18.631
- Well, Tru Air is starting
an executive class airline

05:18.672 --> 05:20.297
for short haul flights.

05:20.339 --> 05:22.464
So obviously we wanna set up
shop in Toronto,

05:22.505 --> 05:23.881
because within an hour
you can be in Chicago,

05:23.923 --> 05:25.797
New York, Montreal, Boston.

05:25.839 --> 05:27.547
- And, to a lesser extent,
Ottawa.

05:27.589 --> 05:29.297
But like, who cares?

05:29.339 --> 05:30.881
- So, we need an innovative
campaign to tell

05:30.923 --> 05:32.797
business travelers why
they should choose Tru Air,

05:32.839 --> 05:34.464
over some discount
propeller plane.

05:34.505 --> 05:36.380
- You know, someone
who knows the box, but...

05:36.422 --> 05:37.589
doesn't give a shit
about the box.

05:37.631 --> 05:39.297
- We think that could be you.
- Holy crap.

05:39.339 --> 05:42.172
- Rosie. So um...

05:42.214 --> 05:44.964
that could be something
I'm interested in, yeah.

05:45.005 --> 05:46.756
- Okay, so we need you
in New York tonight

05:46.797 --> 05:49.047
to pitch to our CEO.
- Tonight?

05:49.088 --> 05:50.422
- No problem.
- Rose!

05:50.464 --> 05:53.130
- I actually have
my kids tonight...

05:54.964 --> 05:58.339
um, but I can find a sitter.

05:58.380 --> 06:00.297
or I could just give 'em
a couple knives,

06:00.339 --> 06:02.297
and let the best man win.

06:02.964 --> 06:05.422
I'll be there, I'm gonna go.
Adian: Cool.

06:08.339 --> 06:10.214
- See, there's your problem.

06:10.255 --> 06:12.297
These hinges are all loose.
- Oh!

06:12.339 --> 06:14.255
- Like somebody's been
slamming them shut.

06:14.297 --> 06:16.088
- Really? Hmm.

06:16.130 --> 06:18.214
I'll just tighten these up,
and you're good to go.

06:18.255 --> 06:21.464
- I can't tell you how much
I appreciate this.

06:21.505 --> 06:23.297
Can I get you a beer?

06:23.339 --> 06:24.589
- Sure.

06:27.214 --> 06:29.047

06:29.088 --> 06:31.547

06:31.589 --> 06:33.881
[Joseph] Mom?
- Oh no.

06:33.923 --> 06:35.756
- Oh.
- Boys!

06:35.797 --> 06:38.422
- Where's all the cereal?
- Oh, don't you don't remember?

06:38.464 --> 06:40.255
You devoured two boxes
yesterday.

06:40.297 --> 06:41.839
- You were supposed to buy more!

06:41.881 --> 06:44.756
- Yeah! We're starving!
Wait. What are you wearing?

06:44.797 --> 06:46.589
- Yeah, what's with
all this makeup?

06:49.005 --> 06:50.589
- Ahem.

06:50.631 --> 06:52.130
- And who are you?

06:52.172 --> 06:54.005
- Ah, this is Mel.

06:54.047 --> 06:55.923
He's helping fix things
around the house

06:55.964 --> 06:57.088

06:58.797 --> 07:00.422
- Nice to meet you boys.

07:02.297 --> 07:06.464
- Hmph. This your beer, Mel?
I'm gonna drink this.

07:06.505 --> 07:08.589
- No, Joseph! No!

07:08.631 --> 07:11.172
- He's drinking
your whole beer!

07:11.214 --> 07:13.589
- Gaaah! Catch.

07:13.631 --> 07:16.464
- (Laughs)

07:16.505 --> 07:17.756
- Did it look cool?
- Yeah.

07:17.797 --> 07:19.464
- It felt cool.
- Yeah?

07:19.505 --> 07:22.088

07:23.422 --> 07:24.839

07:24.881 --> 07:27.756
- Cute kids.
- Oh, I am so sorry.

07:27.797 --> 07:31.047
I just, I-I don't know
what to do with them.

07:31.088 --> 07:33.881
- You know, I've known
a few boundary pushing boys

07:33.923 --> 07:35.631
in my day.

07:35.672 --> 07:37.255
Mind if I have a word?

07:40.839 --> 07:42.047
- She sent you a photo of what?

07:42.088 --> 07:44.005
(Knocking)
- Well...

07:45.589 --> 07:48.088
- You boys aren't pieces
of shit, are you?

07:48.130 --> 07:51.464
Because I met two garbage
boys a minute ago.

07:51.505 --> 07:53.964
And that lady upstairs,
she's an angel.

07:54.005 --> 07:55.714
- Hah!

07:55.756 --> 07:58.130
- So come on,
let's try this again.

07:58.172 --> 08:01.047
- Hey buddy, why don't
you try this again?

08:01.088 --> 08:04.047
(All laugh)

08:04.088 --> 08:05.923
- Oh, I see.

08:08.672 --> 08:10.505
- Ah...

08:10.547 --> 08:13.047
- You boys know about
the human body, don't you?

08:13.088 --> 08:14.505
- What?

08:14.547 --> 08:17.130
- Every muscle and bone
are connected.

08:17.172 --> 08:20.088
And in that way it works
like a family.

08:20.130 --> 08:22.297
So if one bone is disconnected,

08:22.339 --> 08:24.547
the entire body hurts.

08:24.589 --> 08:26.714
Just like a family.

08:26.756 --> 08:28.589
- Who the fuck is this guy?

08:30.297 --> 08:32.130
- I understand you boys
are going through a phase.

08:32.172 --> 08:33.839
I get it.

08:33.881 --> 08:37.255
But if you boys are wanna push
somebody's boundaries...

08:38.547 --> 08:40.130
- What the fuck you doing?

08:40.172 --> 08:42.923
- Push mine,
because I don't have any.

08:44.130 --> 08:46.088
Aah! Aaaah! Aaah!
Boys: Whoa! Oh!

08:46.130 --> 08:48.547
- Aaaaah!
Boys: Ohhh God!

08:48.589 --> 08:50.964
- Oh my God!

08:51.005 --> 08:53.130
What?
- Yeah, yeah.

08:53.172 --> 08:55.464
You see this?
This is you two.

08:56.672 --> 08:59.297
And if you boys don't
get back in place,

08:59.339 --> 09:02.047
there's gonna be a lot of pain.

09:02.088 --> 09:03.756
- Ohhh.

09:03.797 --> 09:05.756
- Ugh!

09:05.797 --> 09:07.505
- So what am I even supposed
to be doing here?

09:07.547 --> 09:09.631
- Your job is to pretend like
you know how to do things,

09:09.672 --> 09:11.047
so I can keep my job.

09:11.088 --> 09:12.923

10:03.631 --> 10:05.714
- If that had happened
to Charlie, I'd have freaked.

10:05.756 --> 10:07.422
- No, it's all good.

10:07.464 --> 10:09.214
- (Laughs) Sorry, man.

10:11.589 --> 10:13.714

Hey, Mike, it's me.

10:24.547 --> 10:27.339
Um, sorry again for flaking
the other day,

10:27.380 --> 10:30.255
something came up,
and anyway, I got some news.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.505
and I would love your thoughts.

10:32.547 --> 10:34.797
(Horn honks) Oh!

Uh... I'm going!

10:36.672 --> 10:38.088
Anyway, give me a call,
you big boner.

10:48.297 --> 10:50.130
- Uh, say it.
- You say it.

10:50.172 --> 10:52.797
- No, what are you--
- Ahem!

10:52.839 --> 10:53.756
- Sorry, mom.
- Yeah, sorry.

10:56.130 --> 10:57.797
- Now say it like you mean it.

10:59.130 --> 11:00.672
[Boys] (In unison) Sorry.

11:00.714 --> 11:03.172
- Sorry for what?

11:03.214 --> 11:06.088
- Disrespecting you.
- Pissing in the garden.

11:06.130 --> 11:08.589
- Oh! Thank you, boys!

11:08.631 --> 11:11.214
- Go, go, go, go, go!

11:11.255 --> 11:12.672
- Little squirrels.

11:13.964 --> 11:16.339
How did you--
- It's nothing.

11:16.380 --> 11:18.297
Some people just need
a little... persuading.

11:18.339 --> 11:19.839
- Oh my, your thumb.

11:19.881 --> 11:23.172
- This, it's just an old
hockey injury, it...

11:23.214 --> 11:24.797
See? Ah-ah.

11:26.047 --> 11:28.714
- I do it all the time.
- Oh.

[Ian] One expresso for you.
There we go.

just talking about you!

12:50.839 --> 12:52.756
Expresso?

I can make you one, too.

I-I just fixed that.

13:10.505 --> 13:12.422

to make friends,

13:12.464 --> 13:14.797
I brought you here to work.
So just go back to your desk.

Be the business boy
I hired you to be,

13:16.339 --> 13:18.380

13:18.422 --> 13:20.005
Just, party's over!

13:22.422 --> 13:23.672
(Pages rustle)

13:25.672 --> 13:27.631
- This sucks.
We get the basement,

13:27.672 --> 13:29.547
and our parents are upstairs
with wine?

13:29.589 --> 13:32.589
- I love that they think you're
this bad influence on me.

13:32.631 --> 13:34.714
- I know! Your Mom's intense.

13:34.756 --> 13:36.547
She's totally freaking out.

13:36.589 --> 13:38.505
- She has my Dad completely
whipped.

13:38.547 --> 13:40.964
- Oh my God, she totally does.
Same with my Mom.

13:41.005 --> 13:43.297
She's whipped my Dad for sure.

13:43.339 --> 13:45.839
- Do you wanna spy on them?
- Why?

13:45.881 --> 13:49.214
- They spy on us,
go through our things.

13:49.255 --> 13:52.339
(Brenna chuckles)
- Let's spy on them.

13:52.380 --> 13:53.964
- Are you aware that
your daughter's

13:54.005 --> 13:56.631
completely manipulative?
- No, she isn't.

13:56.672 --> 13:59.505
- We don't think that, either.

13:59.547 --> 14:02.088
- Good.

14:02.130 --> 14:03.756
(Oven timer dings)
- Hey, let's put a pin in that,

- We're vegetarians.

- Shit!

14:15.464 --> 14:17.505
(Silverware clinks)

14:17.547 --> 14:20.130
- There's something
in there, look.

14:20.172 --> 14:22.547
I bet it's like,
a secret stash of drugs.

- Oh!

14:45.547 --> 14:47.547
- Okay. Hi, guys.
- Come on, buddy.

14:47.589 --> 14:49.005
- Oh my gosh. Yeah.

14:51.214 --> 14:52.547
Oh! So... ah!

14:54.422 --> 14:56.589
A big opportunity
just landed in my lap.

14:56.631 --> 14:57.964
You know Tru Air?

14:58.005 --> 14:59.964
- Um, the airline, yeah.

15:00.005 --> 15:02.547
- Yes! So they are actually
considering me

15:02.589 --> 15:04.881
to create and run a campaign
for them here in Canada,

15:04.923 --> 15:06.505
because they're expanding,

15:06.547 --> 15:07.923
do you know how massive
that would be?

15:07.964 --> 15:09.756
- That's amazing, you would be
perfect for that.

15:09.797 --> 15:12.464
- I know, right? So, the pitch
is tomorrow in New York.

15:12.505 --> 15:14.130
I'd fly out tonight,
so if you could actually

15:14.172 --> 15:15.797
watch the kids, then...
- Kate, I'm sorry,

15:15.839 --> 15:17.714
but I cannot take the kids.
- Why not?

15:17.756 --> 15:19.297
- I-I have to be in court
tomorrow morning,

15:19.339 --> 15:21.297
and I'll be up all night
prepping,

15:21.339 --> 15:22.923
and I still have to get
Charlie's Halloween

15:22.964 --> 15:24.881
costume together, I haven't
bought any of the supplies,

15:24.923 --> 15:27.005
or anything, I mean,
can't you call Val?

15:27.047 --> 15:29.172
Or your sister?

15:29.214 --> 15:31.088
- No, I tried them,
I tried everybody!

15:31.130 --> 15:33.088
I thought you would be...

15:33.130 --> 15:35.380
- I'm sorry.
Kate, I just can't.

15:35.422 --> 15:37.088
I really wish I could,
I do, but...

15:38.881 --> 15:40.839
- I understand.

15:40.881 --> 15:44.172
- Thank you for all your work
you've put in today.

15:44.214 --> 15:45.756
It was like being on
"Queer Eye,"

15:45.797 --> 15:47.380
but with a straight guy.

15:47.422 --> 15:49.297

It was no sweat.

15:51.631 --> 15:53.756
Oh, I um, hope you don't mind,

15:53.797 --> 15:56.005
I set up your speakers

15:56.047 --> 15:57.923
so you can play music
from your phone.

15:57.964 --> 16:00.214

20:42.672 --> 20:44.505
I was built for this.

20:44.547 --> 20:47.881
Wake up early, light breakfast,
just run that pitch to death.

20:47.923 --> 20:50.797
- You have that drink after.
- Oh, let me guess, with you?

20:52.214 --> 20:54.088
- Did they put you up
at the Rococo?

20:54.130 --> 20:56.214
- Mhmm, you too?

20:56.255 --> 20:57.672
- Hmm.

20:59.839 --> 21:01.380
- At least one of us
will get the job.

21:01.422 --> 21:02.714
- Yeah, I guess so.

21:02.756 --> 21:04.964
May the best woman win.
