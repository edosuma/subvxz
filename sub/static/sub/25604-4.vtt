00:26.920 --> 00:31.720
Why don't you glue your head to the TV?
Don't let your food sit. Eat it.

00:32.320 --> 00:35.840
Get me a cable box.
I'll record it and watch later.

00:39.800 --> 00:42.800
-Did you apply for the computer classes?
-Yes.

00:43.600 --> 00:44.720
What's the class called?

00:46.200 --> 00:47.080
What is it?

00:48.080 --> 00:49.000
Magi-Tech.

00:49.760 --> 00:51.080
-Mom!
-Look at me!

00:52.160 --> 00:56.280
Start attending those classes, or else
I'll bash your head into the TV. Got it?

00:56.840 --> 00:58.520
-Let it go.
-Why should I let it go?

00:58.600 --> 01:00.200
Does money grow on trees?

01:00.720 --> 01:01.960
Motherfucker.

01:02.040 --> 01:02.960
Give me the phone.

01:03.040 --> 01:04.720
-It's Mr. Sartaj.
-Give it to me!

01:04.800 --> 01:06.880
-Let me check...
-Practice what you preach.

01:09.200 --> 01:11.160
-I'm switching it off.
-Nag, nag, nag.

02:28.400 --> 02:30.200
<i>His car has arrived at the bungalow.</i>

02:38.640 --> 02:40.320
Nayanika's camera is in place.

02:42.480 --> 02:44.080
<i>She's waiting for Bunty.</i>

02:52.840 --> 02:55.680
He's there. He's sitting next to her.

03:08.520 --> 03:15.160
Do they bring your food on time on set?

03:26.720 --> 03:30.160
Everyone on set
was talking about Gaitonde.

03:32.840 --> 03:33.800
Your friend?

03:44.320 --> 03:45.200
My friend?

03:48.360 --> 03:49.680
Who told you that?

03:51.880 --> 03:54.360
Did I ever say Gaitonde was my friend?

03:55.440 --> 03:57.360
-Did I?
-No.

03:57.520 --> 03:58.640
-I didn't, right?
-No.

03:59.520 --> 04:00.760
<i>Then who told you?</i>

04:01.760 --> 04:02.600
<i>Tell me!</i>

04:03.160 --> 04:05.320
Ma'am, what's happening?

04:07.400 --> 04:09.080
<i>I asked you a question, didn't I?</i>

04:10.440 --> 04:12.760
Who told you?! Who asked you about him?!

04:14.640 --> 04:17.680
Do you go to the set to work or to gossip?

04:18.240 --> 04:19.360
What's happening?

04:21.519 --> 04:24.440
<i>Tell me! Who told you?</i>

04:24.920 --> 04:25.760
<i>Who told you?</i>

04:26.960 --> 04:28.440
<i>Fucking...</i>

04:29.280 --> 04:31.520
-Get out of there.
-What's happening in there?

04:32.800 --> 04:34.080
<i>Motherfucker!</i>

04:34.560 --> 04:36.520
<i>He's seen the camera! Get out!</i>

06:03.040 --> 06:04.440
Mr. Sartaj Singh.

06:05.920 --> 06:09.600
Weren't you the last person
to see Gaitonde alive?

06:12.960 --> 06:15.360
He had such shitty luck.

06:18.440 --> 06:19.600
Anything in his pockets?

06:25.240 --> 06:26.120
Destroy it.

06:27.800 --> 06:28.720
Anything else?

06:35.240 --> 06:37.240
-Keep this.
-Okay.

06:37.840 --> 06:41.160
Return this when he leaves.
It'll be useful on traffic duty.

06:42.440 --> 06:44.360
-What's this?
-I also found this.

06:55.280 --> 06:56.840
Don't eat this shit.

06:58.720 --> 07:02.840
Your manhood will shrink
from this... to this.

07:02.920 --> 07:03.760
Really?

07:05.000 --> 07:07.400
Then I'll have to beat women
to feel like a man.

07:09.600 --> 07:10.720
Are you a man? Let me see.

07:15.480 --> 07:16.680
You are Superman, right?

07:17.720 --> 07:18.560
Show me.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.040
Why did Gaitonde come back?

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
What will happen in 25 days?

07:29.560 --> 07:32.760
Straight from Sonu, the pickpocket,
to Gaitonde.

07:33.920 --> 07:35.600
What crazy luck you have.

07:37.120 --> 07:38.280
Anjali Mathur.

07:39.880 --> 07:41.560
She's a senior officer from Delhi.

07:41.880 --> 07:42.760
So?

07:43.920 --> 07:45.560
Do you want me to marry her?

07:46.120 --> 07:47.400
She'll talk to you.

07:48.840 --> 07:49.960
It's for your own good.

07:52.880 --> 07:54.480
Don't get sucked into this.

07:55.760 --> 07:56.960
I'm getting out.

07:59.800 --> 08:02.280
After tonight, I'll be far away
from this shit.

08:02.760 --> 08:03.680
Got it?

08:05.000 --> 08:07.440
Now, fuck off.

08:10.480 --> 08:11.760
She's coming with me.

08:17.680 --> 08:18.560
She's not.

08:19.920 --> 08:23.160
She's going away. Far, far away.

08:25.840 --> 08:28.600
Take him away. Be respectful.

08:29.680 --> 08:32.640
Treat him well.
He's come here for the first time.

08:33.040 --> 08:35.800
-Move!
-Treat him extremely well.

09:01.320 --> 09:02.240
Let's go.

09:34.360 --> 09:35.240
Stop!

09:36.920 --> 09:37.920
Get out!

09:41.560 --> 09:42.680
Give me your phone. <i>Where are you?</i>

09:58.600 --> 10:00.480
With the target, in Wadala.

10:01.240 --> 10:02.720
Near Bhakti Park Station.

10:03.360 --> 10:04.440
He's stopped here.

10:05.800 --> 10:06.760
Take me to Wadala.

10:07.560 --> 10:09.160
He's going to kill the girl.

10:13.520 --> 10:14.880
Two trucks have stopped. <i>The trucks are following his car.</i>

10:30.080 --> 10:31.720
He put the girl in a different car.

10:31.800 --> 10:34.120
Follow the target, I'll look for the girl.

10:34.200 --> 10:37.080
She's my informer.
I promised to protect her.

10:39.320 --> 10:42.000
I'll follow the girl.
Send me the license number.

10:43.760 --> 10:44.840
Fuck!

11:19.440 --> 11:20.480
Where's my money?

11:48.040 --> 11:49.480
Fuck you, Katekar.

12:07.240 --> 12:08.160
Got it.

12:22.560 --> 12:23.400
Yes.

12:25.080 --> 12:26.560
What about the rest?

12:26.640 --> 12:29.560
Interpol and RAW are out to fuck us.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.960
It will be difficult
to get you out of the country.

12:33.080 --> 12:34.480
Didn't you promise me...

12:35.840 --> 12:39.440
that you'd get me out of the country
before June 17th if I give you the stuff?

12:39.520 --> 12:41.760
-Yes, we still have 20 days.
-Really?

12:43.320 --> 12:44.760
You think Bunty's an idiot?

12:45.680 --> 12:49.640
Do I look like a dickhead to you?

12:50.600 --> 12:53.960
I'm in this because of Gaitonde.
I have nothing to gain here.

12:54.840 --> 12:58.520
-I have nothing to do with your shit.
-Kishore, start loading the stuff.

12:58.600 --> 13:01.160
Hey! I'm not done talking!

13:03.360 --> 13:05.280
I'll deal with you later, motherfucker.

13:06.480 --> 13:09.040
I'll shove an umbrella
up your ass and open it.

13:09.560 --> 13:10.600
I'm warning you.

13:11.960 --> 13:12.800
Got it?

13:14.040 --> 13:14.920
Let's go.

13:52.360 --> 13:55.040
What should we do with him, sir?
He's a cop.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.840
Burn his clothes and body separately.

14:00.360 --> 14:02.360
<i>Rajiv Gandhi did the same thing.</i>

14:02.600 --> 14:05.120
<i>He dealt with Shah Bano</i>
<i>and the country separately.</i>

14:05.360 --> 14:08.160
<i>In 1986, Shah Bano's husband divorced her.</i>

14:09.240 --> 14:11.240
<i>She took him to court and won the case.</i>

14:11.800 --> 14:16.760
<i>But our former PM, Rajiv Gandhi, a pussy,</i>

14:16.840 --> 14:18.360
<i>overturned the court's judgment</i>

14:18.440 --> 14:20.920
<i>and threw Shah Bano to the mullahs.</i>

14:21.480 --> 14:23.800
<i>The Hindus criticized him for this.</i>

14:24.200 --> 14:27.480
<i>He had the </i>Ramayan<i> show</i>
<i>aired on TV to please them.</i>

14:28.440 --> 14:31.960
<i>Every Sunday morning, the entire country</i>
<i>was glued to the TV.</i>

14:32.480 --> 14:35.040
<i>Bunty was no exception.</i>

14:36.080 --> 14:41.400
<i>Bunty understood that religion</i>
<i>could open many doors.</i>

14:45.920 --> 14:49.640
<i>The prime minister's trick worked wonders.</i>

14:51.240 --> 14:54.600
<i>Until your motherland...</i>

14:55.960 --> 15:00.720
<i>is taken back from those pigs...</i>

15:04.800 --> 15:06.880
You motherfucker,
give me back my cassette!

15:07.040 --> 15:08.200
Give it back!

15:10.040 --> 15:10.920
Motherfucker!

15:11.400 --> 15:14.160
-Why the fuck are you breaking it?!
-Shut up, motherfucker!

15:14.240 --> 15:15.800
What were you listening to?

15:15.880 --> 15:17.720
Talk about destroying mosques,
motherfucker?

15:17.800 --> 15:22.240
Have you lost it?
Thinking of destroying mosques?

15:22.320 --> 15:26.680
I will listen to whatever the fuck I want!
I don't need your permission!

15:26.760 --> 15:29.960
-Show me what you can do! You dickhead!
-Wait, I'll show you.

15:30.040 --> 15:31.520
Your sister is waiting for me.

15:32.120 --> 15:34.000
Fuck you, you cunt!

15:34.640 --> 15:36.200
You asshole! Fucking cunt!

15:36.440 --> 15:38.200
You motherfucker!

15:41.080 --> 15:41.920
What are you doing?!

15:42.000 --> 15:45.120
Fuck around in here again
and next time it'll be boiling oil!

15:45.720 --> 15:48.960
Why are you into these Muslim guys?
Does he even get an erection?

15:49.600 --> 15:51.400
Keep working, motherfucker.

15:52.480 --> 15:55.440
He sticks it in deeper
than you ever could.

15:55.560 --> 15:56.720
You bitch, I swear...

15:57.320 --> 15:58.240
Forget it.

15:59.240 --> 16:00.400
Stupid bitch.

16:04.400 --> 16:06.720
I'll kill you and that Muslim guy.

16:07.080 --> 16:08.440
Fuck off.

16:08.520 --> 16:10.960
-You fucking whore. I'll...
-Bunty!

16:12.760 --> 16:13.840
Come here.

16:20.720 --> 16:21.760
She's your sister.

16:28.280 --> 16:30.120
Chotta Badriya loves her.

16:30.680 --> 16:33.640
He'll give her a home and respect.
She'll be happy.

16:34.240 --> 16:36.720
She's already happy,
and she has a home too.

16:37.280 --> 16:38.880
All you do is beat her up.

16:38.960 --> 16:40.960
Do you like beating women?

16:43.840 --> 16:45.560
Fuck all of you.

16:46.600 --> 16:47.840
Women are goddesses!

16:53.760 --> 16:54.640
No.

17:15.280 --> 17:17.160
Why won't you let me turn you over?

17:18.320 --> 17:23.520
If you want to experience my magic,
you can, but only on my terms.

17:45.040 --> 17:47.200
Does Isa kiss men in front of everyone?

17:47.840 --> 17:51.440
-That's how they greet each other.
-But he didn't say "hello."

17:55.160 --> 17:56.440
That's how they say hello.

17:59.680 --> 18:01.280
I want that car.

18:01.360 --> 18:03.360
Ask me and you'll get it all.

18:03.440 --> 18:05.240
What is your magic all about?

18:08.120 --> 18:12.760
Never ask a magician
to reveal her secrets.

18:13.800 --> 18:14.640
Sir.

18:14.880 --> 18:19.280
I went to the temple.
I've brought the offerings for you.

18:23.120 --> 18:24.880
How about this?

18:26.000 --> 18:27.360
Please have some, sir.

18:30.560 --> 18:32.120
Is this also the goddess' offerings?

18:33.680 --> 18:34.760
No, sir.

18:35.520 --> 18:36.560
It's an advance.

18:37.120 --> 18:39.440
Bipin is contesting the election
in Morwad.

18:42.280 --> 18:44.360
-Will he win?
-Yes, sir.

18:44.440 --> 18:48.720
It's dominated by Marathi-speaking people.

18:49.280 --> 18:52.400
There are a few from Gujarat and Marwar,
but they're all Hindus.

18:53.520 --> 18:56.160
Why has he come here?

18:57.960 --> 19:02.080
The Lalgarh area in Gopalmath.
That slum is...

19:04.720 --> 19:05.880
Won't they vote for him?

19:07.120 --> 19:08.000
No.

19:09.280 --> 19:12.640
Sir, how will I get Muslim votes?

19:14.400 --> 19:16.480
What do you want from me?

19:17.400 --> 19:20.720
If the Muslims don't vote, we'll win.

19:24.480 --> 19:28.640
I told you that I don't want to get into
this Hindu-Muslim shit.

19:38.000 --> 19:38.840
Come here.

19:44.040 --> 19:45.120
This is Badriya.

19:45.920 --> 19:46.840
He's a Muslim.

19:49.440 --> 19:50.800
We're friends.

19:52.640 --> 19:53.600
That's Bunty...

19:54.680 --> 19:55.600
a Hindu devotee.

19:55.680 --> 19:57.160
We're all friends.

19:59.600 --> 20:01.560
Gaston and Pascal as well.

20:02.560 --> 20:04.120
And there's the Parsi guy.

20:04.640 --> 20:06.040
He's my cook.

20:08.840 --> 20:10.080
I may be a bad guy...

20:10.960 --> 20:12.400
but I'm not like you.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.640
So don't come back here...

20:19.000 --> 20:20.040
Bipin...

20:21.160 --> 20:22.280
Bhonsle.

20:24.040 --> 20:25.040
Mr. Bhonsle.

20:25.320 --> 20:28.240
Mr. Bhonsle! Mr. Bhonsle!

20:29.120 --> 20:30.080
Mr. Bhonsle.

20:31.160 --> 20:32.680
Mr. Bhonsle, I'm Bunty.

20:33.800 --> 20:36.640
I helped your father buy a piece of land.

20:37.280 --> 20:38.840
I fought the union guys.

20:39.120 --> 20:41.920
Took it right from under
Faruk Chand's builder's nose.

20:45.000 --> 20:45.960
Deepak Shinde?

20:46.640 --> 20:48.960
I broke Faruk Chand's hand
with a steel pipe.

20:49.840 --> 20:53.440
You talk too much. What do you want?

20:54.120 --> 20:56.720
Sir, this is your first election.

20:57.160 --> 20:59.160
You came to Mr. Gaitonde for help.

20:59.640 --> 21:03.240
If you win, you'll make me
one of your aides, right?

21:04.520 --> 21:06.560
He doesn't give a fuck about the election.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.280
Sir, he's a businessman.

21:10.240 --> 21:12.080
He'll help you for the right price.

21:16.200 --> 21:17.160
Mr. Bhonsle.

21:17.240 --> 21:20.360
Asshole! Who the fuck are you
to negotiate for me?

21:22.400 --> 21:23.320
Boss...

21:24.440 --> 21:25.960
there won't be any issues.

21:26.640 --> 21:27.840
You have Kukoo.

21:28.480 --> 21:29.720
You have her magic.

21:29.800 --> 21:33.520
-Gaitonde, hear him out.
-Shove that offer up your ass.

21:38.560 --> 21:41.120
Boss, 50 lakh rupees.

21:49.360 --> 21:52.320
Democracy is worth 50 lakh rupees.

21:52.720 --> 21:58.360
Boss, that's the same price as Isa's car.

22:21.080 --> 22:23.520
Who says Kukoo's magic doesn't work?

22:31.320 --> 22:32.480
Rolls-Royce, baby.

22:37.960 --> 22:39.280
Is it real, baby?

22:40.280 --> 22:42.440
<i>I hated Bhonsle,</i>

22:42.920 --> 22:46.280
<i>but doing business with him</i>
<i>taught me a valuable lesson.</i>

22:46.880 --> 22:50.680
<i>Guns, drugs, real estate,</i>
<i>all of those were small-time.</i>

22:51.040 --> 22:53.480
<i>The real business was politics.</i>

23:20.520 --> 23:22.760
<i>Even before India became a country,</i>

23:23.160 --> 23:27.200
<i>people have been using religion</i>
<i>to sway political decisions.</i>

23:27.760 --> 23:30.080
<i>When I got involved with Bhonsle,</i>

23:30.480 --> 23:34.840
<i>the mafia became integral</i>
<i>to religion and politics.</i>

23:35.480 --> 23:37.960
<i>A new era began in India.</i>

23:42.440 --> 23:44.760
<i>The game wasn't between</i>
<i>Gaitonde and Isa anymore.</i>

23:45.200 --> 23:46.880
<i>It was between the Hindus and the Muslims.</i>

23:48.680 --> 23:50.240
Have faith in us.

23:54.040 --> 23:55.760
I'll take care of everything.

24:13.080 --> 24:14.280
Gaitonde!

24:15.440 --> 24:16.360
Come out!

26:55.560 --> 26:56.840
Long live India, sir.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.680
I told you to give me a daily update.

27:01.840 --> 27:03.600
Not much has happened.

27:04.560 --> 27:07.200
I want Bunty.
Get him before anyone else does.

27:08.120 --> 27:11.960
-Other agencies are also involved.
-They're not based in Mumbai.

27:13.880 --> 27:14.840
You are.

27:48.200 --> 27:51.920
My wife turned my phone off. Wives...

27:57.160 --> 28:03.280
They were emptying water from the tanks
and filling them with something else.

28:03.760 --> 28:06.200
-What was it?
-I don't know.

28:07.160 --> 28:08.800
Who was the other guy?

28:09.520 --> 28:10.800
He didn't look Indian.

28:11.480 --> 28:13.640
-Was he a foreigner?
-Maybe.

28:13.720 --> 28:17.720
Bunty will be out of the country
by the 16th.

28:18.680 --> 28:21.640
That's when the 25 days will end.

28:25.080 --> 28:26.200
Where is Nayanika?

28:35.760 --> 28:38.200
Markand, I have a lead.

28:44.840 --> 28:45.720
Was it here?

28:56.720 --> 28:57.720
Fuck!

29:15.000 --> 29:16.840
Are you a man or a horse?

29:19.120 --> 29:21.920
Bunty's gone.
Isn't he the reason we're here?

29:27.280 --> 29:28.760
Don't you understand?

29:30.360 --> 29:34.240
She'll just use you, then throw you away.

29:37.160 --> 29:39.120
They call it collateral damage.

29:51.040 --> 29:54.000
<i>You've created an elaborate theory</i>
<i>based on a local cop's word.</i>

32:51.880 --> 32:53.000
Move aside, fucker.

32:53.480 --> 32:55.120
The cripple has called me.

32:56.920 --> 33:01.480
<i>Brother, staying away</i>
<i>from your holy presence...</i>

33:23.240 --> 33:25.680
-Did you find out about Gaston and Pascal?
-No.

33:26.000 --> 33:29.200
The police came looking for you.
They've arrested two of my waiters.

33:30.040 --> 33:33.160
I'm shitting myself here
and you're worried about your waiters.

33:33.320 --> 33:36.640
-How will I get out of here?
-Did I tell you to get stuck in this?

33:48.800 --> 33:49.920
You're getting old.

33:50.560 --> 33:52.440
-Control your temper.
-Shut up. -Get to the point.
-Serve the food!

34:17.800 --> 34:21.320
What do you think? It doesn't make
any difference now. Understand?

34:22.560 --> 34:23.960
I'm asking you something!

34:24.760 --> 34:27.920
Look at me! Talk to me!

34:29.960 --> 34:34.560
Eat, or else I'll shove it up your ass!

34:35.040 --> 34:37.880
You think you're a goddess?

34:38.040 --> 34:41.040
If you're a goddess,
then I'm a demon! A demon!

34:42.040 --> 34:46.640
What are you gonna do?
You think you can hit me?

34:46.960 --> 34:50.200
You cunt. Sit! Sit there!

34:51.840 --> 34:55.720
Everyone is looking for me because of you!

34:56.320 --> 34:58.280
I won't tolerate this anymore. Got it?

35:12.920 --> 35:14.040
What are you looking at?

35:15.760 --> 35:17.480
I told you to serve me food, didn't I?

35:19.400 --> 35:21.400
Does this look like a show to you?

35:22.960 --> 35:24.160
Call Shivaji.

35:28.400 --> 35:30.320
Shivaji. Come here.

35:32.400 --> 35:35.080
What's the name of that whore from RAW?

35:35.560 --> 35:36.520
Anjali Mathur.

35:37.400 --> 35:38.320
Get her number.

35:43.120 --> 35:46.760
He called me out of the blue...
after ten years.

35:48.520 --> 35:52.080
He asked me for a favor.

35:53.040 --> 35:54.360
I do as he says.

35:54.840 --> 35:56.920
Who's killing Gaitonde's men?

36:06.640 --> 36:09.960
Why do you want to leave the country?
What's going to happen on the 16th?

36:13.560 --> 36:15.760
Ma'am, don't you know how deals work?

36:17.320 --> 36:19.400
-What's in it for me?
-What do you want?

36:21.240 --> 36:22.760
I'll tell you everything.

36:23.560 --> 36:25.240
Just get me out of here.

36:26.400 --> 36:28.640
Out of this country. Out of India.

36:29.800 --> 36:30.720
Singapore.

36:35.920 --> 36:40.360
We'll pick you up in three hours.
You'll be taken to a safe house.

37:05.560 --> 37:06.640
Don't go in there.

37:08.400 --> 37:10.360
She'll die if she doesn't eat.

37:25.280 --> 37:26.160
Please eat.

37:28.720 --> 37:31.360
Call Sartaj Singh.

38:02.120 --> 38:05.440
<i>There's a street next to the Nagpada</i>
<i>bus depot in Ambedkar Nagar.</i>

38:06.000 --> 38:08.280
<i>RAW is taking him away in two hours.</i>

38:08.640 --> 38:09.520
Who?

38:10.600 --> 38:12.600
<i>The girl asked me to call you.</i>

38:26.800 --> 38:27.640
What happened?

38:28.960 --> 38:31.200
Bunty, I know where he is.

38:33.240 --> 38:35.560
-Where?
-He's made a deal with RAW.

38:35.960 --> 38:37.800
He'll be out of the country
in two and a half hours.

38:38.840 --> 38:42.280
If we arrest him before that,
we'll have all the information.

38:43.280 --> 38:44.280
I need backup.

38:50.760 --> 38:52.080
Why did you come here?

38:53.480 --> 38:54.520
RAW doesn't have enough people?

38:58.440 --> 38:59.880
Did she fuck you over?

39:02.920 --> 39:05.280
Bunty has my informer.

39:06.560 --> 39:07.840
Her life is in danger.

39:11.440 --> 39:14.400
Then it's easy. Call for backup.

39:18.720 --> 39:19.600
On one condition.

39:25.480 --> 39:26.760
Junaid was armed.

39:29.840 --> 39:30.920
He fired and ran.

39:33.160 --> 39:35.320
I warned him to surrender.

39:38.240 --> 39:40.680
He turned, pointed the gun at me...

39:43.280 --> 39:44.840
and was going to pull the trigger.

39:50.120 --> 39:51.440
I had to shoot him.

40:07.440 --> 40:13.000
<i>A man sweeps his dirt under the rug</i>
<i>to show the world how clean he is.</i>

40:15.480 --> 40:19.040
<i>I invested my black market money</i>
<i>and launched an airline...</i>

40:19.520 --> 40:21.040
<i>in Paritosh's name.</i>

40:41.040 --> 40:42.840
What are you doing here?

40:43.000 --> 40:47.880
-It's my airline.
-Are you trying to ruin the business?

40:47.960 --> 40:51.480
Two guys from the press have already
asked me who's financed this.

40:51.560 --> 40:53.080
You or Gaitonde.

40:54.160 --> 40:56.240
Get out.

40:56.960 --> 41:01.200
Come upstairs and we can talk.

41:01.280 --> 41:05.720
If you want to be in the limelight
and pose for the cameras,

41:05.800 --> 41:07.920
this deal won't work.

41:08.320 --> 41:12.640
I'm sorry, but the work you do
will have to stop.

41:13.240 --> 41:15.720
-No offense...
-No, continue.

41:16.680 --> 41:17.840
Speak your mind.

41:35.120 --> 41:38.200
<i>Do you understand what I'm saying?</i>

41:39.800 --> 41:40.680
Make me understand.

41:41.440 --> 41:42.400
That Kukoo...

41:42.840 --> 41:44.600
-What about Kukoo?
-"What about Kukoo"?

41:44.680 --> 41:47.800
Do you have any idea what she is?

41:48.800 --> 41:52.120
And you're waltzing around
in public with her? She is...

41:55.720 --> 41:56.680
Big brother...

42:01.800 --> 42:03.800
think before you speak.

42:03.920 --> 42:06.800
The whores in your fashion show
downstairs,

42:06.880 --> 42:10.240
all your investors...
did you think they landed in your lap?

42:11.120 --> 42:14.960
Are they here because of you?

42:15.040 --> 42:16.560
No, Kukoo brought them.

42:17.080 --> 42:20.880
She used her magic
hidden in her underwear.

42:21.560 --> 42:23.880
There's extra space there, right?

42:30.520 --> 42:35.680
If you love and trust her so much,
why don't you marry her?

42:36.960 --> 42:40.400
Marry her, have babies,
settle down with her.

42:40.920 --> 42:43.480
Don't worry about me.

42:48.720 --> 42:50.880
I can buy happiness...

42:52.400 --> 42:56.240
with all the money I have.

42:57.800 --> 42:58.720
You...

42:58.960 --> 43:02.560
Gaitonde, why don't you
try and understand?

43:03.320 --> 43:05.520
If you want Kukoo, keep her...

43:06.360 --> 43:09.840
but marry a decent girl.

43:09.920 --> 43:12.920
Then keep Kukoo on the side, hidden.

43:16.200 --> 43:17.400
Think about it.

43:18.720 --> 43:20.160
I'll think about it.

43:21.160 --> 43:23.600
-Hey.
-Where's Kukoo?

43:25.480 --> 43:26.400
Where's Kukoo?

43:26.920 --> 43:28.080
Boss, downstairs...

43:29.800 --> 43:30.880
Kukoo.

43:33.440 --> 43:35.040
-Kukoo.
-Go away!

43:36.560 --> 43:37.920
-Kukoo.
-Go away!

43:38.000 --> 43:40.200
-Open the door.
-Fuck off!

43:40.280 --> 43:41.600
Kukoo, open the door!

43:41.720 --> 43:42.920
Go away!

43:43.600 --> 43:45.480
Just go away!

43:46.840 --> 43:49.320
What do you want?! Tell me!

43:49.760 --> 43:52.200
You want to fuck me in the ass again?
Do it!

43:52.600 --> 43:54.080
Don't you get it?!

43:54.520 --> 43:56.720
That's not how you get pregnant!

43:57.360 --> 43:59.960
I can't give you children! Now go away!

44:01.200 --> 44:02.400
Go away!

44:03.440 --> 44:05.640
Do you know what I was told?

44:06.400 --> 44:09.440
They told me I was an asshole,
motherfucker.

44:09.520 --> 44:10.760
A fucking asshole.

44:11.280 --> 44:14.640
I was sent to fuck and be fucked
by all of you gangsters...

44:15.200 --> 44:17.400
so you don't fuck the rest of the world.

44:17.760 --> 44:18.760
Got it?

44:19.360 --> 44:21.280
I'm done now. Go away.

44:23.680 --> 44:24.680
Don't touch me.

44:26.360 --> 44:28.080
-No, stay away from me.
-Don't hide.

44:28.560 --> 44:32.880
-What do you want to see?
-I want to see.

44:32.960 --> 44:34.520
-What will you see?
-Everything.

44:34.600 --> 44:35.840
What do you want to see?

44:36.920 --> 44:38.360
Is this what you want to see?

44:40.440 --> 44:42.160
Is this what you want to see?

44:42.720 --> 44:44.400
I can't have children.

44:46.200 --> 44:47.360
I can't.

44:49.680 --> 44:50.720
Leave.

44:53.880 --> 44:55.000
Get away from me.

44:55.520 --> 44:59.080
I know what I'll get in the end.

45:00.560 --> 45:02.240
-One bullet.
-No.

45:02.720 --> 45:05.320
Either in the chest, or in the head.

45:08.160 --> 45:12.000
Before I die, I want to have it all.
And I will have it all.

45:13.080 --> 45:16.760
Fuck Paritosh.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.520
I don't want your magic.

45:21.360 --> 45:22.440
I want you.

45:24.560 --> 45:26.800
I want your love and laughter.

45:26.880 --> 45:31.600
I want... Listen, I want to see you happy.

45:35.360 --> 45:37.720
I want to see you smile.

45:39.960 --> 45:41.680
I'll take care of the rest.

45:48.640 --> 45:53.600
<i>Paritosh thought I couldn't make</i>
<i>my money legitimately without him.</i>

45:54.040 --> 45:56.080
<i>I started my own soft drink company.</i>

45:56.160 --> 45:58.360
<i>It was called Apna Cola.</i>

45:58.880 --> 46:00.360
<i>It was Kukoo's idea.</i>

46:16.800 --> 46:19.000
<i>Apna Cola was a failure.</i>

46:25.760 --> 46:28.320
<i>I threw a party to lighten the mood.</i>

46:35.120 --> 46:36.760
<i>But Kukoo's mood was off.</i>

46:39.760 --> 46:43.600
<i>She thought her charm was lost</i>
<i>because I saw her naked.</i>

46:44.240 --> 46:46.000
<i>That something bad would happen.</i>

46:47.440 --> 46:48.520
What's wrong with you?

46:49.080 --> 46:51.080
You look worried.

46:57.200 --> 46:58.200
You go ahead.

46:59.560 --> 47:00.680
Let's go and party.

47:04.280 --> 47:06.000
Why don't you ever kiss me?

47:07.000 --> 47:07.960
What do you mean?

47:09.000 --> 47:12.640
You fuck me, day in and day out...

47:14.360 --> 47:15.720
but you don't kiss me.

47:19.920 --> 47:22.560
You're very tall.

47:23.880 --> 47:25.360
Wait, I'll kiss you now.

47:25.720 --> 47:26.960
-I'll bend down.
-I...

47:34.440 --> 47:35.280
Wow.

47:36.480 --> 47:38.840
You never gave a damn before,
why start now?

47:39.920 --> 47:40.800
Let me...

47:46.800 --> 47:48.040
Tell me that you won't die.

47:50.760 --> 47:51.880
Why would I die?

47:55.240 --> 47:58.360
Promise me that you won't.

48:00.160 --> 48:01.120
I promise.

48:03.280 --> 48:04.280
I won't die.

48:07.640 --> 48:08.960
If you stay with me...

48:10.840 --> 48:11.840
they'll kill you.

48:14.880 --> 48:16.920
Everything will fall apart.

48:35.440 --> 48:38.600
You know you'll be a big shot.

48:40.080 --> 48:45.080
You'll become more famous
than Amitabh Bachchan.

48:48.280 --> 48:49.920
Bachchan dies in<i> Deewaar...</i>

48:53.480 --> 48:55.040
but you will shine like the sun...

48:56.600 --> 48:58.080
forever.

48:59.240 --> 49:00.520
All over Bombay.

49:01.560 --> 49:02.400
Only...

49:03.840 --> 49:05.800
Only if my baby is alive.

49:19.160 --> 49:20.840
For Bachchan to stay alive...

49:24.480 --> 49:25.960
Parveen Babi has to go.

49:27.400 --> 49:29.960
You're not going anywhere. You...

49:32.440 --> 49:33.360
can't go.

50:10.120 --> 50:13.240
<i>That was the last time I saw Kukoo.</i>

51:16.040 --> 51:18.280
Greetings from Suleiman Isa.
